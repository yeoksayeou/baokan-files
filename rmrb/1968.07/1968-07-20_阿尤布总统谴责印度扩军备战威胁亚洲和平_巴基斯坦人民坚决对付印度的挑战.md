New Delhi, July 18 (Xinhua) - According to a report by the Pakistan News Agency, Pakistani President Ayub Khan said on July 18 in Karachi that India's large-scale military buildup is threatening peace in the Asian region.

President Ayub Khan arrived in Karachi from the capital, Rawalpindi, on July 18. In his speech at the Karachi airport to members of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League, he pointed out that India's ambition to expand its military strength is not only dangerous to Pakistan but also to the Indian people, as the Indian rulers are expanding their military capabilities without considering their country's resources.

President Ayub Khan said that the Pakistani people are a brave nation and will bravely and resolutely confront India's challenges. Pakistan is capable of defending its borders and is taking all necessary measures to protect its integrity.
