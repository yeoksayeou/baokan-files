The U.S. Sixth Fleet's arrival in Turkey has sparked intense protests. Young people in Ankara have expressed their anger by smashing windows at American institutions. Over the past few days, more than thirty American sailors have been beaten and injured. In response, the U.S. has hastily announced "strict restrictions" on sailors going ashore.

Newspaper reports from Ankara on the 19th indicate that on the 18th, a powerful anti-American storm swept through the Turkish capital. Young Turks took to the streets, chanting slogans and throwing ink and rotten eggs at American officials. They also smashed windows at several American institutions.

This new wave of protests began when some ships from the U.S. Sixth Fleet arrived in the coastal city of Istanbul on the 15th. In recent days, protests have erupted in both Istanbul and Ankara, condemning the U.S. fleet's activities in Turkey despite the opposition of the Turkish people. Protesters smashed windows at the Pan American World Airways office and the U.S. Information Service in a busy district of Ankara. On the evening of the 17th, they also broke windows at an American-run movie theater in Ankara.

In recent days, enraged Turkish people have had enough and have beaten up American sailors who came ashore. Reports indicate that 17 American sailors were injured in Ankara, and 18 in Istanbul. Faced with the strong protests of the Turkish people, American imperialism has had to announce "strict restrictions" on American sailors going ashore.

    新华社十九日讯　安卡拉消息：土耳其首都安卡拉十八日又一次掀起了反对美帝国主义的强烈风暴。高呼口号的土耳其青年们愤怒地在大街上示威，向在当地活动的美国官员泼墨水，扔臭鸡蛋，并用石块砸烂了一些美国侵略机构的窗户。
    这一新的风暴，是随着美国第六舰队的一些军舰在十五日驶抵土耳其沿海大城市伊斯坦布尔而掀起的。连日来，在伊斯坦布尔和安卡拉，曾不断爆发示威，抗议美国舰队不顾土耳其人民的反对，又一次开到这个国家活动。示威的群众把设在安卡拉闹市区的美国泛美航空公司和美国新闻处的窗户都砸烂了。十七日晚上，人们还打碎了美国在安卡拉开设的电影院的窗子。
    这些天来，愤怒的土耳其人民忍无可忍地痛揍了上岸活动的美国水兵。据报道，已有十七名美国水兵在安卡拉被打伤，十八名美国水兵在伊斯坦布尔被打伤。美帝国主义在土耳其人民的强大示威面前，已不得不宣布“严格限制”美国水兵上岸。
