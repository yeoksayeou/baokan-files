Shanghai Third Iron and Steel Plant's revolutionary workers have earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, firmly grasped class struggle, and carried out sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism. This has driven the entire plant's production to thrive.

Since this year, the plant's production has been on the rise month after month. In April, the plant's steel and steel product output increased by 1.91 times and 2.6 times respectively compared to March. In May, the plant's struggle against the enemy deepened, and production continued to rise significantly across the board. In June, despite the plant's workers engaging in intensive equipment maintenance, steel production was still increased by 19.8% compared to May. At the same time, the plant successfully developed 68 new products. Particularly in the development of low-alloy high-strength steel and steel products, as well as in completing the trial production of special products, significant achievements have been made.

With the help of the stationed People's Liberation Army, the plant has used workshops and teams as the base to organize various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In these classes, revolutionary workers and members of various levels of revolutionary committees study Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle and his latest series of instructions together, discuss the situation of class struggle together, and carry out revolutionary criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev. This has greatly heightened the revolutionary workers' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, fundamentally mobilized the immense socialist enthusiasm hidden within the masses, and ensured the sustained rise in production.
