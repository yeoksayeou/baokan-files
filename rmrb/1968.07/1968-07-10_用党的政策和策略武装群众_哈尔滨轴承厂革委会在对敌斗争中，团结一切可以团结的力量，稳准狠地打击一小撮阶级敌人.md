Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party. All levels of leadership must pay full attention to this; under no circumstances should one be careless and negligent." The Harbin Bearing Factory Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the PLA's support-left personnel, has earnestly followed Chairman Mao's teachings, armed the masses with the Party's policies and strategies, and in the struggle against the enemy, united all possible forces to strike accurately and decisively at a handful of class enemies.

Since its establishment, the factory's Revolutionary Committee has closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, actively leading the revolutionary masses in carrying out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, exposing and smashing the evil plots of stubborn class enemies who collude with the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to push a rightist reversal.

The revolutionary workers, with deep hatred for the class enemies, launched a high tide of exposure, criticism, and struggle. A handful of class enemies, intimidated by the mighty power of the dictatorship of the masses, immediately changed their counter-revolutionary strategies, using the evil tactics of sowing discord and stirring up trouble to confuse the two different types of contradictions, disrupt the class lines, and attempt to divert the direction of the struggle in order to prolong their existence and wait for an opportunity to counterattack.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question for the revolution, and also the primary question for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." After the PLA comrades detected the new moves of the class enemies, they immediately realized that they must guide the revolutionary workers to better grasp the policies and strategies for the struggle against the enemy. They, together with the members of the Revolutionary Committee, used Chairman Mao's great teachings on correctly handling the two different types of contradictions and his relevant statements on the struggle against the enemy as weapons, summarizing the experiences of the previous period of struggle against the enemy. Everyone deeply realized that to carry the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end, it is necessary to strictly distinguish and correctly handle the two different types of contradictions, firmly rely on the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, and unite the maximum number of forces that can be united, always directing the spearhead of the struggle at a handful of class enemies. Otherwise, one would not distinguish between friends and enemies, or mistake friends for enemies, or enemies for friends, and would suffer great losses and be deceived, possibly deviating from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The Revolutionary Committee and the PLA comrades immediately went deep into the grassroots and among the masses, addressing the problems that existed in the actual struggle, and thoroughly propagandizing Chairman Mao's policies and strategies for the struggle against the enemy.

Once Chairman Mao's policies and strategies for the struggle against the enemy are grasped by the masses, the struggle against the enemy advances more smoothly along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The revolutionary workers of this factory used Chairman Mao's method of class analysis to strictly distinguish a handful of class enemies from comrades who have made serious mistakes but are not enemies; to strictly distinguish counter-revolutionary revisionists who oppose the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought from comrades who have said or done some wrong things; to strictly distinguish a few bad leaders from those who have been deceived and used by them and have done some bad things. The revolutionary workers followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "the nature of the contradictions between the enemy and us and the contradictions within the people are different, and the methods of resolving them are also different," adopting different attitudes and handling methods for different types of problems, and firmly acting according to the Party's policies.

The revolutionary workers used the method of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity" to correctly handle comrades who have made mistakes or serious mistakes, actively seeking these comrades to have heart-to-heart talks, helping them to draw a clear line between themselves and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, the bad leaders in mass organizations, and the capitalist reactionary line; to draw a clear line between their erroneous thoughts and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and giving them the opportunity to correct their mistakes. They boldly assigned them work, letting them go among the masses to be tested and tempered, so that they could quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The revolutionary workers of the Finance and Economics Department gathered five comrades who had made mistakes of varying degrees and held a Mao Zedong Thought study class. They, with the spirit of strict requirements, clarifying thoughts, and distinguishing right from wrong, while paying attention to unity and education, helped the comrades who had made mistakes to analyze the roots of their mistakes with Mao Zedong Thought; using the method of reminiscence and comparison, raising their class consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle. The spiritual outlook of these five comrades quickly changed. With deep hatred for the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and with boundless love for Chairman Mao, they eagerly wanted to correct their mistakes and threw themselves into the struggle against the enemy. The factory Revolutionary Committee and the PLA comrades seized the example of the Finance and Economics Department and propagated and promoted it throughout the factory, making the revolutionary workers pay more attention to grasping the Party's policies and strategies, making the comrades who had made mistakes actively put down their burdens and march forward lightly. Some who were originally prepared to "break the pot and throw it away" were deeply moved and voluntarily checked their mistakes, standing on the side of the revolutionary masses. In this way, a handful of class enemies were maximally isolated.

After uniting the broad masses, the factory's struggle against the enemy became more powerful and thorough. The revolutionary workers used various methods to carry out revolutionary criticism, exposing and criticizing the various tricks of the class enemies, making them fully exposed. A counter-revolutionary cadre who participated in the rightist reversal activities was previously very dishonest and refused to admit his crimes. After the masses were mobilized, those who had been deceived by him dared to expose his crimes, making him have to admit his guilt. When the revolutionary workers launched a powerful political offensive against the class enemies, they also paid attention to using policies to win over their hearts, seriously implementing the policy of "leniency for those who confess, severity for those who resist," splitting and disintegrating some interconnected and colluding class enemies, and maximizing the isolation of a few die-hard elements, continuously achieving victories in the struggle against the enemy.

    用党的政策和策略武装群众
    哈尔滨轴承厂革委会在对敌斗争中，团结一切可以团结的力量，稳准狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人
    本报讯　伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。”哈尔滨轴承厂革命委员会，在解放军支左人员帮助下，认真遵照毛主席的教导，用党的政策和策略武装群众，在对敌斗争中团结了一切可以团结的力量，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    这个厂的革命委员会成立以来，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，积极率领广大革命群众深入持久地开展革命大批判，揭露和粉碎了顽固不化的走资派勾结国民党反动派残渣余孽和地富反坏右分子大搞右倾翻案的罪恶阴谋。广大革命职工怀着对阶级敌人的深刻仇恨，掀起了大揭发、大批判、大斗争的高潮。一小撮阶级敌人，慑于群众专政的巨大威力，立即改换反革命策略，用挑拨离间、煽风点火的恶毒手法，极力混淆两类不同性质的矛盾，扰乱阶级阵线，妄图转移斗争大方向，以便苟延残喘，伺机反扑。
    毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题。”解放军同志察觉到阶级敌人的新动向以后，立即认识到必须引导广大革命职工更好地掌握对敌斗争的政策和策略。他们和革委会成员一起，以毛主席关于正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾的伟大教导和对敌斗争的有关论述为武器，总结了前段时间对敌斗争的经验。大家深刻地认识到，要把这场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底，必须严格区分和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，坚定地依靠无产阶级革命派，最大限度地团结一切可以团结的力量，始终把斗争的矛头对准一小撮阶级敌人。否则，就会不分敌友，或者认友为敌，或者认敌为友，就要吃大亏、上大当，就可能背离毛主席的革命路线。革委会和解放军同志马上一起深入基层，深入群众，针对实际斗争中存在的问题，深入宣传毛主席关于对敌斗争的政策和策略。
    毛主席关于对敌斗争的政策和策略，一旦为群众所掌握，就使对敌斗争更好地沿着毛主席的革命路线胜利前进。这个厂的革命职工运用毛主席的阶级分析方法，把一小撮阶级敌人同犯有严重错误但还不是敌我矛盾的同志严格区分开来；把反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的反革命修正主义分子同说过一些错话或做过一些错事的同志严格区分开来；把少数坏头头和被他们蒙蔽利用、做过一些坏事的人严格区分开来。革命职工遵循毛主席关于“敌我之间和人民内部这两类矛盾的性质不同，解决的方法也不同”的教导，对不同性质的问题，采取不同的态度和处理方法，坚决按照党的政策办事。
    广大革命职工运用“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的方法，正确对待犯有错误或严重错误的同志，主动找这些同志交心谈心，帮助他们同党内一小撮走资派、群众组织中的坏头头和资产阶级反动路线划清界限；同自己的错误思想划清界限，并且给他们以改正错误的机会，大胆地交给他们工作，让他们到群众中去接受考验和锻炼，使他们尽早地回到毛主席的革命路线上来。财经科的革命职工，把五名犯有不同程度错误的同志找在一起，举办了毛泽东思想学习班。他们本着既严格要求、弄清思想、分清是非，又注意团结教育的精神，帮助犯错误的同志，用毛泽东思想分析犯错误的根源；用回忆对比的方法，提高阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。这五名同志的精神面貌迅速改变，他们怀着对党内一小撮走资派的深刻仇恨，怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，带着改正错误的迫切愿望，投入对敌斗争。厂革委会和解放军同志抓住财经科的事例，在全厂宣传推广，使广大革命职工更加注意掌握党的政策和策略，使犯错误的同志主动放下包袱，轻装前进。有些原来准备“破罐子破摔”的人，深受感动，都自觉地检查了错误，站到了革命群众一边。这样就最大限度地孤立了一小撮阶级敌人。
    这个工厂把广大群众团结起来以后，对敌斗争更有声势，更加深入。革命职工利用各种方式开展革命大批判，狠揭狠批阶级敌人的种种阴谋诡计，使之暴露无遗。一个参加右倾翻案活动的反革命骨干分子，以前极不老实，死不认罪。在群众发动起来之后，那些曾经受过他蒙蔽的人大胆起来揭发他的罪行，使他不得不低头认罪。革命职工在向阶级敌人发动强大的政治攻势时，还注意采取政策攻心，严肃地执行了“坦白从宽、抗拒从严”的政策，分化瓦解一些互相牵连、互相勾结的阶级敌人，把极少数死硬分子最大限度地孤立起来，不断取得了对敌斗争的胜利。
