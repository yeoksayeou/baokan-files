The Qinghai-Tibet Highway winds and curves, crossing snow-capped mountains and spanning vast rivers, like a great artery connecting the heart of the motherland to the southwestern border.

Amidst the enthusiastic cheers of the entire military and civilian population celebrating the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the soldiers and officers of the Third Company of the 8075 Unit, with unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao, braved temperatures of minus forty degrees Celsius and battled a raging blizzard on the summit of the Tanggula Mountains for six days and nights. They triumphantly played the song of Mao Zedong Thought on the "Roof of the World."

	Not Reaching the Great Wall is Not a Hero

In February 1968, after being tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the motorized soldiers of the Third Company of the 8075 Unit were to traverse the Tanggula Mountains, which stand at an elevation of 5,400 meters and are known as the "Roof of the World."

When their convoy arrived at the foot of the mountain, they suddenly received a weather report: the Tanggula Mountains were experiencing the heaviest snowfall in history!

The Tanggula Mountains are high and treacherous, with thin air. Coupled with heavy snowfall and temperatures dropping to minus forty degrees Celsius, and winds of eight to nine levels, the difficulties were immense.

What to do? Advance or retreat?

The soldiers and officers of the Third Company, holding the Red Book, gave a resounding answer:

"We have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We fear neither heaven nor earth and will definitely make the Tanggula Mountains bow and the blizzard give way!"

These powerful words expressed the soldiers' boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao.

At dawn on February 6, the Third Company's convoy, facing the blizzard, advanced towards the summit of the Tanggula Mountains, the "Roof of the World."

The wind whipped the snow into a frenzy, like rolling sand filling the valleys and like a raging river flooding the mountains. One snowdrift after another blocked the convoy's path. Company Commander Tao Zhanxie led his comrades in loudly reciting Chairman Mao's teachings: "Resolutely carry out the task, be prepared to make sacrifices, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." The comrades, like tigers, charged towards the massive snowdrifts on the road. Some wielded shovels, while others knelt in the snow, pushing it aside with their hands to clear a path.

In this high-altitude, low-oxygen environment, the comrades' physical reactions were severe. Veteran soldier Wang Bingshun felt dizzy and saw stars, and his shovel seemed to disobey his commands. At this moment, Chairman Mao's warm instructions echoed in his ears: "What is work? Work is struggle." He instantly felt a surge of inexhaustible strength, rallying his spirits to fight tenaciously without a moment's rest.

Thus, the entire company of soldiers and officers battled the wind and snow for fifteen straight hours, covering only one-seventh of the day's journey.

On the second day, the wind was stronger, and the snow fell faster. The snowdrifts on the road became more numerous and higher. The soldiers' high-altitude reactions also became more severe.

The wind blew so hard that it was impossible to keep one's eyes open or stand steady. Three trucks were even blown off course. The extreme cold encased everyone in a thick layer of "ice armor." After two days, they had only eaten one meal, and with severe high-altitude reactions, everyone's strength began to wane.

Company Commander Tao fainted but, upon waking, without even brushing off the snow on his body, he commanded the troops to fight on. Comrades urged him to rest, but he replied loudly, "Not reaching the Great Wall is not a hero! Dying for the people's interests on the Tanggula Mountains is a worthy death!"

This heroic declaration expressed the resolve of the entire company and further inspired the fighting spirit of the soldiers and officers!

	"Who says the air is thin on the snow mountains? We have an extremely thick political atmosphere! Who says the temperature is low on the snow mountains? The sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought warms our hearts endlessly!" Eighty-one hearts, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, can clear a thousand-mile icy road and overcome countless difficulties! The comrades of the Third Company, after more than two days of hunger and thirst and three nights without sleep, bravely overcame one obstacle after another. Finally, in the afternoon of the third day, they triumphantly stood on the summit of the Tanggula Mountains, at an elevation of 5,400 meters.

	Plum Blossoms Bloom Amidst the Snow

On the summit of the Tanggula Mountains, towering snow walls stood in their way. To proceed, they had to shovel away these snow walls.

In the raging wind and snow, the officers and soldiers of the Third Company stood tall like sturdy pines. They recited Chairman Mao's teachings, shouted battle slogans, and began a new, more intense battle. Before nightfall, a snowdrift nearly one hundred meters long was cleared, but before all the vehicles could pass, the narrow "snow alley" was filled again by the rolling snow.

The soldiers' physical strength was severely depleted, and the number of sick comrades increased. However, no one mentioned the word "difficulty." There was only high-spirited singing. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought transformed into an endless force to battle the heavens and earth in the revolutionary soldiers.

To hasten victory, the battalion political instructor Wang Wenpin and Company Commander Tao decided to send someone fifty miles ahead to the Tanggula Mountain military outpost to establish contact.

Walking fifty miles in the blizzard on the Tanggula Mountains was an extremely arduous task. Faced with difficulties, everyone volunteered to take on the heavy burden. Finally, Political Instructor Wang decided that he, along with Communist Party members Liang Yongxiang and Shi Fujin, would complete this arduous mission. The three supported and encouraged each other, braving the howling winds and trudging through the deep snow towards the outpost.

The battle on the mountain continued intensely. Just then, orders from higher authorities came: to preserve the troops' strength for future battles, the Third Company's vehicles would temporarily stay on the mountain, and the personnel would retreat to the Tanggula outpost for rest. After a discussion, the officers of the Third Company decided to leave Platoon Leader Zhang Jianlin, Deputy Squad Leader Li Baoxing, Fu Chuntao, and three other comrades on the mountain to guard the vehicles. As soon as this decision was announced, the comrades eagerly volunteered to stay on the mountain and were reluctant to leave. After repeated persuasion by the officers, they reluctantly left the summit.

The first thing the six comrades who stayed did was to hold the Red Book in formation and solemnly swear to Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao, we are infinitely loyal to you. To complete the glorious mission you have entrusted to us, we fear neither the raging blizzard nor hunger and cold." Their ironclad oath expressed the revolutionary soldiers' boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao. They forgot their extreme hunger, fatigue, and severe high-altitude reactions, held the Red Book, and stood guard around the vehicles, vigilant and spirited.

Life is struggle, and hardship is glory. The six iron soldiers fought tenaciously from the evening of February 8 to the morning of February 11, completing their glorious mission and sharing the joy of hard struggle.

	Military and Civilian Unity is Like One Person

The news of the Third Company's convoy being besieged by the blizzard spread like wildfire. The revolutionary cadres of Qinghai's "August 18" and Tibet were extremely anxious for their comrades in danger.

The "August 18" comrades first learned of the Third Company's plight on February 7. That evening, when Political Instructor Wang and three other comrades delivered a message to the Tanggula outpost, they passed through the 107th road station. The "August 18" soldiers, seeing the PLA, were like seeing long-lost relatives. After learning their purpose, they firmly said, "We will take on the task of delivering the message!" By then, it was already dark, with howling winds and dancing snow. Tibetan worker Zaxi volunteered to deliver the message, braving the biting cold and deep snow, covering more than twenty kilometers, quickly establishing contact with the outpost's brother units and the "August 18" revolutionary cadres.

When the road workers heard that there were still six comrades on the mountain, they worried about the soldiers' hunger and cold, and feared the vehicles would be damaged. They braved the blizzard to visit the mountain several times, bringing words of encouragement: "Resolutely carry out the task, be prepared to make sacrifices, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." They also brought hot meals and coats, and finally said:

"Soldiers, let us carry you down. We will take on the task of guarding the vehicles! Rest assured, we will ensure the safety of both people and vehicles." This sincere and heartfelt request further strengthened the six soldiers' resolve to fight to the end in the wind and snow. They said, "This is the battlefield entrusted to us by Chairman Mao and the people of our motherland. We cannot leave for even a moment." Their deep class feelings of loving Chairman Mao and their shared battle mission united the hearts of the military and civilians, and they stood guard over the vehicles together on the wind-swept Tanggula Mountains.

The news reached the Tanggula North Mountain Yan Shiping Highway maintenance section, where comrades participating in the Mao Zedong Thought study class decided to move the class to the mountain to study and apply Chairman Mao's works with the PLA and to open roads on the snow mountains together. Over a hundred comrades, carrying the Red Book, set out for the battlefield that night. By four in the morning, they arrived at the Tanggula outpost and met with the comrades of the Third Company who had come down for rest. Relatives meeting, they were exceptionally enthusiastic, shaking hands and embracing each other. Great Mao Zedong Thought bound them together in an indestructible bond of shared life and death, shared hardship.

"Military and civilian unity is like one person; see who can stand against us!" In the face of the iron wall of military-civilian unity, the roaring Tanggula Mountains finally bowed their heads! The unprecedented blizzard finally gave way!

"Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman; revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." The invincible Mao Zedong Thought warmed the hearts of the revolutionary soldiers. They overcame six days and nights of extreme cold, with no vehicles damaged and no soldiers severely frostbitten. Great Mao Zedong Thought inspired the military and civilians to fight side by side, igniting their revolutionary spirit to seize the revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, and soar with unparalleled vigor!

    毛泽东思想的凯歌响彻“世界屋脊”
    ——记人民解放军八○七五部队三连汽车队指战员排除万难战胜六昼夜的狂风暴雪
    青藏公路，连绵曲折，越过皑皑雪山，跨过滔滔江河，象一条大动脉，从祖国的心脏通向西南边疆。
    在全国军民热烈欢呼无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的凯歌声中，八○七五部队三连车队的指战员，怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚，冒着零下四十多度的严寒，在唐古拉山巅与狂风暴雪英勇奋战了六天六夜，在“世界屋脊”奏响了一曲毛泽东思想的凯歌。
        不　到　长　城　非　好　汉
    一九六八年二月，经过无产阶级文化大革命战斗洗礼的八○七五部队三连的汽车兵，要通过拔海五千四百米高，被称为“世界屋脊”的唐古拉山。
    当他们的车队来到山下兵站的时候，突然接到气象预报：唐古拉山出现了历年来最大的雪封！
    唐古拉，山高路险，空气稀薄，加上大雪封山，气温下降到零下四十多度，八、九级的大风，搅着雪花，漫天飞舞，困难确实很大。
    怎么办？是前进还是后退？
    三连的指战员，手捧红色宝书，作出了响亮的回答：
      “我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，天不怕，地不怕，一定能叫唐古拉山低头，叫暴风雪让路！”
    这铿锵有力的话，倾吐了革命战士对毛主席的无限忠心。
    二月六日拂晓，三连的车队迎着暴风雪，向“世界屋脊”——唐古拉山顶挺进。
    狂风席卷飞雪，象滚滚流沙填平沟壑，象滔滔激流漫平山间。公路上一道又一道的雪岭，把车队的去路截断。三连连长陶占侠，带领同志们高声朗诵毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”同志们个个象猛虎一样冲向横在公路上的大雪岭，有的挥起铁锹，有的跪在雪堆里，用双手一把一把地推雪开路。
    在这空气稀薄的高寒地区连续作战，同志们的身体反应很大。老战士王丙顺感到头重脚轻，眼冒火花，手中的铁锹好象也不听他使唤了。这时，毛主席的亲切教导，在他耳边回响：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。”他顿时觉得浑身又增加了用不完的力量，振起精神，一分钟也不休息，顽强地战斗着。
    就这样，全连指战员与风雪整整搏斗了十五个小时，才走了一天路程的七分之一。
    第二天，风更大，雪更急。横在公路上的雪岭越来越多，越来越高，战士们的高山反应也越来越严重。
    大风刮得人睁不开眼睛，站不稳身体。有三台汽车竟然被风刮得移动了位置。极度的严寒使每个人的身上，都结了一层厚厚的“冰甲”。两天了，只吃了一顿饭，加上严重的高山反应，大家的体力渐渐衰弱下来。
    陶连长晕倒了，醒来以后，连身上的雪也顾不得拍打一下，就指挥部队战斗。同志们劝他休息一下，他高声回答说：“不到长城非好汉！为人民利益死在唐古拉，就是死得其所！”
    这气壮山河的豪言壮语，表达了全连同志的决心，更有力地鼓舞了全连指战员们的战斗情绪！
      “谁说雪山空气稀薄？我们有无比浓厚的政治空气！谁说雪山气温低？毛泽东思想的阳光，无限温暖着我们的心底！”八十一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，可排千里冰雪路，能闯万重困难关！三连同志两天多缺吃少喝，三天两夜没有合眼。他们闯过一关又一关，终于在第三天下午，胜利地踏上了拔海五千四百米的唐古拉的顶峰。
        梅　花　欢　喜　漫　天　雪
    唐古拉山顶，垛垛雪墙，迎面而立。要前进，必须铲掉这些雪墙。
    在狂风大雪中，三连的干部战士，个个象挺拔的劲松。他们背诵着毛主席语录，高喊着战斗的口号，又开始了一场新的、更加激烈的战斗。天黑之前，一道近一百米长的雪岭被打通了，可是还没等全部车辆通过，这条狭窄的“雪胡同”又被滚滚的雪流填满了。
    战士们的体力消耗已经到了严重的程度，病号不断增多。可是全连没有一个人提到“困难”这两个字，有的只是高亢的歌声。战无不胜的毛泽东思想，在革命战士身上，变成了无穷无尽的战天斗地的力量。
    为了争取尽快胜利，深入连队随车上路的营教导员王文聘和陶连长决定，派人到前边五十多里的唐古拉山兵站去取得联系。
    在暴风雪的唐古拉山顶步行五十多里，是一个极为艰巨的任务。在困难面前，大家争先报名挑重担。最后王教导员决定，由他自己和共产党员梁永祥、史富金完成这个艰苦的任务。三个人互相搀扶着、鼓励着，顶着咆哮的寒风，踏着厚厚的积雪，向兵站方向顽强地走去。
    山上的战斗仍然紧张地进行着。正在这时，传来了上级首长的指示：为了保持部队的体力，以利再战，决定三连车辆暂留山顶，人员撤到前面的唐古拉兵站休整。三连干部经过研究，决定留下三排长张建林、副班长李宝兴、傅春桃等六名同志在山上看守车辆。这个决定一宣布，同志们纷纷要求留在山上，不愿离去。经干部们反复动员，大家才依依不舍地离开了山顶。
    留下的六名同志，所作的第一件事，就是手捧宝书，整齐列队向毛主席庄严宣誓：“毛主席啊，毛主席！我们无限忠于您。为了完成您交给我们的光荣使命，我们不怕狂风暴雪，不畏饥饿严寒。”钢铁般的誓言，表达了革命战士对毛主席的无限忠心。他们忘掉了极度的饥饿、疲劳和严重的高山反应，手捧宝书，精神抖擞地握着手中武器，不停地在车辆四周巡逻站岗。
    生活就是斗争，艰苦就是光荣。六名钢铁战士，从二月八日晚，顽强战斗到二月十一日上午，完成了光荣使命，共享了艰苦奋斗的幸福。
        军　民　团　结　如　一　人
    三连车队被暴风雪围困的消息，象电波一样迅速传开。青海“八·一八”和西藏的无产阶级革命派的战士，都为亲人遇险万分焦急。
      “八·一八”战友第一次得到三连在山上遇险的消息，还是在二月七日。这天傍晚，当王教导员等三名同志到唐古拉兵站送信时，途中经过一○七道班。“八·一八”战士见到了解放军，象见到久别重逢的亲人。在问明来意后，他们坚决地说：“这个送信的任务就交给我们了！”这时天已黑了，风狂雪舞，藏族工人扎西主动承担起送信任务，他顶着呛人的寒风，踏着没膝深的积雪，往返二十多公里，很快与兵站兄弟部队和“八·一八”革命派取得了联系。
    当道班工人听说山上还有六名同志的消息后，担心战士受饿、受冻，又担心汽车受损失，几次冒着暴风雪上山看望，一会儿送去战胜困难的强大武器：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”一会儿送去热腾腾的饭菜，一会儿又送去皮大衣，最后索性说：
  “解放军同志，我们把你们背下去，把看车的任务交给我们吧！保证人在车在，你们就放心地下去吧！”这诚挚而又深情的要求，更坚定了六个战士在风雪里奋战到底的信心，他们说：“这里是毛主席和祖国人民交给我们的战斗岗位，我们一分一秒也不能离开。”无限热爱毛主席的深厚阶级感情和共同的战斗任务，把军民的心连得更紧了，他们一起在风雪唐古拉山顶看守车辆。
    消息传到唐古拉北山雁石坪公路养路段，正在参加毛泽东思想学习班的同志，决定把学习班搬到山上去，与解放军一起活学活用毛主席著作，一起在雪山上开路。一百多名同志，当夜怀揣宝书，开赴战场。深夜四点多钟，到达了唐古拉兵站，和三连下来休整的同志会师了。亲人见面，分外热情，又是握手，又是拥抱，伟大的毛泽东思想使他们牢牢结成同生死、共患难的牢不可破的战斗友谊。
      “军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？”在军民团结的钢铁长城面前，咆哮的唐古拉山终于低头了！罕见的暴风雪终于让路了！
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”战无不胜的毛泽东思想，无限温暖着革命战士的心灵。他们战胜了六天六夜的低温严寒，没有一台车辆遭受损失，没有一名战士严重冻伤。伟大的毛泽东思想，激励着军民并肩战斗，焕发出抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备的革命斗志，无比昂扬！
