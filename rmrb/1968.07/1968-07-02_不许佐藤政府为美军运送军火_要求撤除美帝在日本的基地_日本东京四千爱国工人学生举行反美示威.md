Tokyo: Approximately four thousand patriotic workers, students, and citizens held a rally and demonstration near the U.S. military base in Tachikawa, Tokyo, on the evening of June 28. They strongly condemned the Sato reactionary government's plot to transport fuel and explosives for U.S. military jets.

The demonstrators passed a resolution at the rally, condemning the Sato reactionary government for actively serving U.S. imperialism's war of aggression in Vietnam. The resolution stated: "The U.S. military bases in Japan are serving as forward bases for U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam. U.S. rogue military aircraft take off from Japan to bomb Vietnam. We will not allow the war actions of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. We will resolutely continue our struggle until the U.S. military bases are removed and the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' is smashed."

The resolution warmly praised the anti-U.S. struggles of the Vietnamese people, the French people, and the people of the world. The resolution pointed out that these struggles are fundamentally shaking the capitalist system. To support the revolutionary people of the world, the Japanese people will launch even more powerful offensives.

After the rally, the participants held a spirited demonstration march. They carried red flags and banners and advanced towards the Yashima Station of the Japan National Railways. Members of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) held high red flags with the words "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!" and participated in the demonstration march. The demonstrators received enthusiastic support from the residents along the way.

As the march was proceeding, U.S. rogue aircraft took off one after another from the Tachikawa base, flying over the heads of the demonstrators, threatening them. The demonstrators angrily waved their fists and loudly condemned the rogue actions of the U.S. military aircraft.

After the demonstration march, about five hundred students, young workers, members of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), and citizens held another rally in the square in front of Yashima Station. All the representatives who spoke at the rally emphasized the need to strengthen the struggle against U.S. imperialism and strongly condemned the conspiracy of the revisionist group led by Kyuichi Tokuda of the Japanese Communist Party to sabotage the anti-U.S. struggle. After the rally, about one hundred students rushed into the Yashima Station line, holding another spirited demonstration march.

On the same day, one thousand national railway workers in Kanagawa Prefecture held rallies at the Yokosuka Station and Yashio Station in Yokohama City, expressing their determination to fight to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and to oppose the transportation of fuel for U.S. military jets.

After the rallies, the workers held demonstration marches along the railway tracks and called on the citizenry to rise up and join the struggle against the transportation of U.S. military supplies and for the dismantling of U.S. military bases.

According to reports, due to the worsening situation in the Vietnam War, the U.S. military authorities urgently requested the Sato government to increase the transportation of fuel to the two U.S. Air Force bases in Tachikawa and Riyukyu by fifty percent starting from July 1. However, due to the growing anti-U.S. struggle by workers, students, and citizens, the Sato government was forced to postpone the implementation of the plan to increase the transportation by fifty percent.

Japanese revolutionary masses are striving to study the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and the great Mao Zedong Thought is inspiring them to wage a heroic and tenacious struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and modern revisionism.

    不许佐藤政府为美军运送军火　要求撤除美帝在日本的基地
    日本东京四千爱国工人学生举行反美示威
    新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：东京爱国工人、学生和市民约四千人六月二十八日晚上在东京郊区美军横田基地附近的昭岛市举行集会和示威游行，强烈谴责佐藤反动政府为美军的喷气式飞机加紧运输燃料和炸药的阴谋。
    示威群众在集会上通过了一项决议，谴责佐藤反动政府积极为美帝侵越战争服务。决议说：“美国在日本的军事基地正在充当美帝侵略越南的前哨基地，美国强盗军用飞机从日本起飞去轰炸越南。我们决不容许美日反动派的战争行动。我们将坚决把我们的斗争坚持下去，直到美国军事基地被撤除，日美‘安全条约’被粉碎。”
    决议热烈赞扬越南人民、法国人民以及世界各国人民的反美斗争。决议指出，这些斗争正在从根本上动摇着资本主义制度。为了声援全世界的革命人民，日本人民将发动更加猛烈的攻势。
    会后，与会者举行了斗志昂扬的示威游行。他们高举着红旗和标语牌，向日本国营铁道拜岛车站前进。日中友好协会（正统）的会员们，高高举起写着“毛泽东思想万岁！”的红旗，参加了这次示威游行。示威者沿途受到了居民们的热烈支持。
    当游行队伍正在行进途中，美国强盗飞机一架接着一架地从横田基地起飞，飞过示威队伍的上空，对示威群众进行威胁。示威者愤怒地挥舞拳头，大声谴责美军飞机的强盗行径。
    示威游行后，约有五百名学生、青年工人、日中友好协会（正统）会员和市民们，在拜岛车站前面的广场上再次举行集会。在会上讲话的所有代表，都强调必须加强反对美帝的斗争，并强烈谴责日共宫本修正主义集团破坏反美斗争的阴谋。会后，约一百名学生冲进拜岛车站路线场，再次举行了斗志昂扬的示威游行。
    同一天，神奈川县一千名国营铁路工人在横须贺车站和横滨市安善车站分别举行大会，表示决心要为废除日美“安全条约”和反对为美军喷气式飞机运输燃料而斗争。
    大会后，工人沿着铁轨举行示威游行，并呼吁市民群众奋起参加反对运输美国军火和争取拆除美国军事基地的斗争。
    据报道，美军当局由于侵越战争的形势加速恶化，急急忙忙要求佐藤政府从七月一日起把运往横田、立川这两个美国空军基地的喷气式飞机的燃料运输量增加百分之五十。但是佐藤政府慑于工人、学生、市民反美斗争的日益高涨，不得不被迫推迟实行增加运输量百分之五十的计划。（附图片）
