Revolutionary criticism, with its irresistible force, is driving all work forward. The revolutionary criticism at the Datong Coal Mine has achieved great success: it has further promoted the ideological transformation of the workers, with good deeds and good people emerging in abundance; coal production continues to rise; since the beginning of this year, the entire mine has implemented more than 200 major technological innovations; the spirit of self-reliance, hard work, and thrift in running enterprises is taking shape; and old institutions have been broken, with a significant reduction in the number of staff.

The revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of the Datong Coal Mine in Shanxi Province, with the enthusiastic support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army's propaganda team stationed at the mine, have used revolutionary criticism as a powerful driving force to push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to new depths. Through revolutionary criticism, the spiritual face of the people and the entire mine have undergone a tremendous transformation, with revolutionary torrents surging forward and production surging ahead. In the second quarter of this year, coal production increased by 59.1% compared to the first quarter. In May and June, the entire mine achieved full marks in production and construction, and in July, production continued to set new records. Out of the eleven mines in the entire system, seven have set new records since the mine's establishment.

Revolutionary criticism has exposed the counter-revolutionary revisionist trash

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, not only requires us to expose the handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and other counter-revolutionaries hiding within the revolutionary ranks and overthrow them organizationally, but also to overthrow them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, exposing their reactionary faces and evil souls in broad daylight. The revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of the Datong Coal Mine have taken the deep and sustained development of revolutionary criticism as a long-term and strategic measure to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent the restoration of capitalism. They have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out revolutionary criticism, effectively destroying the foundation of capitalism restoration by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the mine.

For many years, a handful of capitalist-roaders in the mine have vigorously promoted "money as the commander" and "material incentives" and other revisionist trash as an important means of restoring capitalism in the mine. Through revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres have deeply realized that the "self" is the core of the bourgeois and all exploiting classes' worldview, and that counter-revolutionary economism has been able to spread in the mine because there are remnants of exploiting class ideology in our minds. To criticize counter-revolutionary economism, we must fiercely struggle against the "self" in our minds. "Self" is the root of revisionism, and revisionism is the fruit of "self." If the "self" does not fall, the mountains and rivers will be difficult to protect, and if the "revisionism" is not criticized, capitalism will be restored.

"We now have an important task on the ideological front, which is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary workers of the Datong Coal Mine follow this great teaching of Chairman Mao, focus on targets, and fiercely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist trash of "money as the commander" and "material incentives." They use production teams as the base, hold production site struggle meetings, face-to-face struggle meetings, and thoroughly expose the heinous crimes of a handful of capitalist-roaders in attempting to restore capitalism in the mine. The entire mine, from the pits to the streets and dormitories, has become a battlefield for revolutionary criticism.

In the face of the powerful revolutionary criticism movement, a handful of class enemies are unwilling to accept their defeat and stubbornly resist, spreading the reactionary fallacy that "'money as the commander' and 'material incentives' cannot be overthrown or criticized, even if they are criticized, they are like stinky tofu, smelling bad but tasting good." However, the revolutionary masses of the Datong Coal Mine firmly believe in the power of Mao Zedong Thought and the power of revolutionary criticism. They unwaveringly carried out a sustained revolutionary criticism of the counter-revolutionary economism promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the mine, fiercely criticizing the bourgeois worldview represented by China's Khrushchev with "self" as the core. The workers say, "If you are bewitched by the money of the capitalist-roaders, you will lose the power of the proletariat." "Money as the commander" and "material incentives" are poison, not stinky tofu, but rotten dog shit. They wielded the thousand-jin cudgel of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smashing the revisionist trash that China's Khrushchev and his agents had long promoted in the mine. The spirit of communism, mining for revolution without seeking fame or gain, has been greatly promoted, and good deeds and good people have emerged in abundance.

Revolutionary criticism opens up a new world of technological innovation

"Not breaking means not establishing. Breaking is criticism, is revolution. Breaking must be reasoned, and reasoning is establishing. Breaking comes first, and establishing is within it." The revolutionary criticism at the Datong Coal Mine fully proves this great truth taught by our great leader Chairman Mao. Through revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres thoroughly exposed the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in promoting the "expert line," "technology first," and using bad people to seize technological power in the mine. This made the broad revolutionary masses deeply realize that the masses are the true heroes, and that running enterprises and carrying out technological innovations must rely on ourselves and cannot rely on any bourgeois technological "authorities" or bourgeois "experts." The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, with the attitude of masters, opened up a new world of technological innovation, and the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do was greatly promoted. The movement of technological innovation and technological revolution among the masses flourished.

The revolutionary masses of Hongsan Mine have been designing and manufacturing a type of coal loading machine since 1958, which is simple in structure, convenient to operate, and suitable for coal mining faces. Due to the sabotage and difficulties imposed by a handful of capitalist-roaders on the masses' own inventions, this new thing created by the masses was aborted. In the fierce revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary masses fiercely criticized the reactionary fallacies of crawling and slavery spread by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the mine, and carried out face-to-face debates and struggles with a handful of capitalist-roaders and bourgeois reactionary technological "authorities." They dared to innovate and create, giving the coal loading machine a new life. The first new-style coal loading machine has already started to be used. The revolutionary masses of this mine also conducted more than 50 experiments on a large combined coal mining machine that had long been unable to function, thoroughly reforming the machine and greatly improving its production efficiency.

The broad revolutionary masses, with Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and revolutionary criticism as a driving force, combined production with reality, innovating where there are key issues and solving problems where there are needs. The repair team of Hong'er Mine, consisting of more than ten workers, did not seek fame or gain, did not fear hardship or difficulty, and with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," carried out technological innovation. In just one year, they successfully innovated seven machines, including washing ball machines, wheel installation machines, wheel removal machines, turning machines, and hoisting machines, through their spare time, realizing the mechanization of all manual repair processes.

According to incomplete statistics, since the beginning of this year, the Datong Coal Mine has implemented more than 200 major innovations, which have greatly promoted the reduction of labor intensity, improvement of production efficiency, and ensured the overfulfillment of the state's coal production plan.

Revolutionary criticism establishes a new trend of thrift in running enterprises

In the revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of the Datong Coal Mine thoroughly exposed the crimes of a handful of capitalist-roaders in the mine who showed off, indulged in luxury, and wasted state funds. In the past, a handful of capitalist-roaders in this mine would always ask the state for more people, money, and equipment when making plans. They thought the smaller the production task, the better; the more labor, the better; the newer the machines, the better; and the larger the buildings, the better. They would discard the old for the new and the small for the large, causing huge waste to the state. Through the exposure and criticism of these evil deeds, the broad revolutionary masses have become aware that China's Khrushchev and his agents not only attempt to restore capitalism politically and ideologically but also spread bourgeois poison in their style of work. Showing off, indulging in luxury, and wasting state funds are the decadent style of bourgeois enterprise management. With this style, people's thoughts will become revisionist, and the proletarian regime will change in nature. Therefore, whether or not to adhere to the policy of thrift in running enterprises is not just an economic issue but a major issue of whether the enterprise will change color. The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres firmly remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings of "self-reliance" and "thrift in building the country," elevating the saving of a drop of oil, a degree of electricity, an inch of steel, and an inch of wood to the height of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. Many workers in mining and excavation teams insist on not returning empty-handed when going down the pit and not returning empty-handed when coming up the pit, recovering broken boards, broken chains, old drills, pit props, and other items discarded in the pit over the years. Many workers in mechanical and electrical teams have carried out activities to repair and reuse old items, making many dead machines come back to life and making a large number of waste materials function again in production. The mass movement of thrift has saved a large amount of funds for the state. The transportation team of Hongshi Mine has saved more than 550 million yuan for the state in the second quarter of this year alone. This has ensured that the mine, without increasing equipment and labor, has achieved a new production peak during the Cultural Revolution.

Recently, the mine held a "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" and "Thrift Revolution" oath-taking rally, where a handful of capitalist-roaders' bourgeois style of "seeking big and foreign things" and "liking new things and disliking old things" were fiercely criticized, digging at the foundations of socialism. The mass movement of thrifting revolution has been pushed to a new high, and the new trend of self-reliance, hard work, and thrift in running enterprises is taking shape in the Datong Coal Mine.

Revolutionary criticism has destroyed the old institutions

The surging revolutionary criticism movement has increasingly deeply impacted the entire set of counter-revolutionary revisionist enterprise management lines promoted by China's Khrushchev, as well as the old superstructure and old institutions serving this line, ensuring that the mine advances along the path of "streamlining administration" pointed out by Chairman Mao.

The revolutionary committee of the Datong Coal Mine, seizing the opportunity, consciously established Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line while thoroughly smashing the counter-revolutionary revisionist enterprise management line. The overlapping administrative organs have been broken, and new organs have been born in the revolutionary storm. In the past, the Datong Coal Mine had a complex organization, overlapping institutions, and a serious phenomenon of too many people and too few jobs. According to statistics, the original bureau had 28 departments, offices, and sections, with more than 1,000 cadres. Now, the institutions have only "one office and three departments," namely, the office of the revolutionary committee, the political department, the production department, and the logistics department. The subordinate mines have "one office and three teams." The number of staff has been greatly reduced, with the bureau-level organs reduced by two-thirds and the mine-level organs reduced by three-quarters.

The new organizational structure is simple, with fewer people handling affairs, which is conducive to highlighting proletarian politics, resisting bourgeois corruption, and promoting the ideological transformation of people. The leading members of the revolutionary committees at all levels follow Chairman Mao's teachings of "being both an 'official' and a common person" and "consulting with the masses on everything and being a student of the masses," often going deep into the grassroots and among the masses, standing on the front line of class struggle, and participating in study classes, holding symposiums, and carrying out heart-to-heart talks with the broad revolutionary masses, vigorously propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and doing in-depth and detailed political and ideological work.

The revolutionary committees of the Datong Coal Mine at all levels have taken the ideological transformation of the leading cadres as the focus of their own construction. Some mines have moved the production command center to the pit, taking turns to be on duty in the pit every day, participating in labor regularly, visiting injured and sick people, seeking opinions from the masses, and placing themselves among the masses, actively and consciously accepting the criticism and supervision of the worker masses. Where there are difficulties, they go there; where the situation is complex, they go there; where the work is hard, they go there. They are revolutionary pioneers at all times, in all things, and in all places, setting an example for the broad masses. They pay attention to major issues and also to minor issues, especially to the non-specialization of their work style. Some mines have regulations that they do not sit in the first five rows when watching a play, leaving them for the worker masses; they sweep the floors and fetch water in the office themselves; they personally receive visitors who come to see the leaders. Some mines have regulations that they do not take small cars to the bureau for meetings unless it is very urgent, and they all walk or ride bicycles. Some leaders even personally deliver water to the underground workers and have heart-to-heart talks with them in the pit.

Because of the change in the style of work of the leading members of the revolutionary committees, they have become even more closely connected with the masses, and the relationship between cadres and the masses has become closer. The broad revolutionary masses love, care for, support, and help the revolutionary committees even more, often proposing criticisms and suggestions for the work of the revolutionary committees.

Revolutionary criticism is being carried out vigorously in the Datong Coal Mine, driving all work forward with irresistible force. Currently, the proletarian revolutionary cadres and broad revolutionary masses of the Datong Coal Mine are determined to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, deepen the revolutionary criticism, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    革命大批判以雷霆万钧之力推动各项工作向前发展
    大同煤矿革命大批判取得伟大成果：进一步促进了职工的思想革命化，好人好事层出不穷；煤炭产量不断上升；今年以来全矿实现了二百多项重大技术革新；自力更生，艰苦奋斗，勤俭办企业的新风尚正在形成；打破了旧的机构，工作人员大大减少
    本报讯　山西省大同煤矿的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在驻矿解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的热情支持和帮助下，把革命大批判作为推动无产阶级文化大革命向纵深发展的强大动力，通过革命大批判，人们的精神面貌和整个矿山的面貌发生了翻天覆地的变化，革命洪流汹涌澎湃，生产高潮滚滚向前。今年第二季度煤炭产量比第一季度提高了百分之五十九点一，五、六两月全矿生产建设实现满堂红，进入七月份，生产又不断创造新纪录，全局十一个矿，其中有七个矿创造了建矿以来的最高纪录。
  革命大批判搞臭了反革命修正主义黑货
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场人类历史上第一次无产阶级文化大革命，不但要我们把隐藏在革命队伍里的一小撮叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派和其他反革命分子揭露出来，从组织上把他们打倒，而且要从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批倒，批臭，使他们的反动面目和丑恶灵魂现形于光天化日之下。大同煤矿的广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众把深入持久地开展革命大批判，当做巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的百年大计，千年大计，当做夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要战略措施。他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器开展革命大批判，有力地摧毁了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在矿山复辟资本主义的基础。
    多少年来，党内一小撮走资派在矿山大力推行的“金钱挂帅”、“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货，是他们在矿山复辟资本主义的一个重要手段。通过革命大批判，广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众深刻认识到：“私”字是资产阶级和一切剥削阶级世界观的核心，反革命经济主义所以能够在矿山上得到推行，就是因为我们头脑中有剥削阶级思想的残余。要批判反革命经济主义，必须狠斗自己头脑中的“私”字。“私”是“修”之根，“修”是“私”之果，“私”字不倒，江山难保，“修”字不批，资本主义就会复辟。
    “我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”大同煤矿广大无产阶级革命派和革命职工遵循毛主席这一伟大教导，集中目标，狠批“金钱挂帅”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货。并以班组为基点，开生产现场批斗会，面对面的斗争会等，彻底揭露党内一小撮走资派复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。全矿井上、井下、街道、宿舍，到处都成了革命大批判的战场。
    在声势浩大的革命大批判群众运动面前，一小撮阶级敌人不甘心于他们的失败，负隅顽抗，散布什么“‘金钱挂帅’、‘物质刺激’批不倒，斗不臭，臭也是臭豆腐，闻起来臭，吃起来香”的反动谬论。但是大同煤矿的无产阶级革命派，最相信毛泽东思想的威力和革命大批判的威力，坚定不移地对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在矿山的代理人推行的反革命经济主义展开了持久的革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的以“私”字为核心的资产阶级世界观。工人们说：“迷了走资派的钱，就要丢掉无产阶级的权”。“金钱挂帅”，“物质刺激”是毒药，并不是什么臭豆腐，而是臭狗屎。他们奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，彻底砸烂中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人长期以来在矿山推行的修正主义黑货。不为名、不为利、为革命而采煤的共产主义精神大大发扬，为公忘私，为人民服务的好人好事层出不穷。
    革命大批判开创了技术革新的新天地
    “不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”大同煤矿的革命大批判充分证明了我们伟大领袖毛主席所教导的这一伟大真理。通过革命大批判，广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，彻底揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在矿山推行的“专家路线”、“技术第一”和任用坏人篡夺技术大权的滔天罪行。这使广大革命群众深刻认识到：群众是真正的英雄，办企业、搞技术革新，必须依靠自己，绝不能依靠什么资产阶级的技术“权威”，依靠什么资产阶级的“专家”。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众以主人翁的姿态，开创技术革新的新天地，敢想、敢说、敢干的革命精神大发扬，技术革新与技术革命的群众运动蓬勃展开。红三矿的革命群众，从一九五八年开始就自己设计、自己制造了一种结构简单、操作方便、适用于采煤工作面的装煤机，由于一小撮走资派对群众自己的创造发明千方百计地打击和刁难，使群众自己创造装煤机这一新生事物夭折了。在轰轰烈烈的革命大批判中，广大革命群众狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在矿山散布的爬行主义、奴隶主义等反动谬论，并对一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”进行了面对面的辩论和斗争。他们大胆革新，大胆创造，使装煤机又获得了新生。第一台新式的装煤机已经开始使用。这个矿的革命群众还经过了五十多次的试验，对一台长期不能发挥作用的大型联合采煤机进行了彻底改革，使这台机器大大发挥了它的生产效能。
    广大革命群众以毛泽东思想为武器，以革命大批判为动力，结合生产、联系实际，那里是关键，就在那里搞革新；那里需要，就到那里解决问题。红二矿修车组的十多名工人，不图名，不图利，不怕苦，不怕难，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，大搞技术革新。在短短一年里，他们就利用业余时间革新成功了洗珠机、装轮机、退轮机、翻车机、起重机等七台机器，使原来靠手工修车机工序全部实现了机械化。
    据不完全统计：今年以来大同煤矿实现了二百多项重大革新，这对减轻劳动强度，提高生产效率，保证超额完成国家煤炭生产计划，起了极大的推动作用。
    革命大批判树立了勤俭办企业新风尚
    在革命大批判中，大同煤矿的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，对党内一小撮走资派讲排场摆阔气，奢侈腐化，挥霍浪费国家资财的罪行进行了彻底的揭露。过去，这个矿的一小撮走资派每次订计划就向国家伸手要人、要钱、要设备，他们是生产任务越小越好，劳力越多越好，机器越新越好，建筑是越大越好。他们有新的就不要旧的，有大的就丢掉小的。这样给国家造成了巨大的浪费。通过对他们这些罪恶的揭发和批判，广大革命群众清醒地认识到：中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人不只从政治上、思想上来复辟资本主义，而且在作风上散布资产阶级毒素。讲排场，摆阔气，挥霍浪费国家资财，就是腐朽的资产阶级办企业的作风。有了这种作风，人的思想就要变修，无产阶级的政权就要变质。因此，坚持不坚持勤俭办企业的方针，不只是个经济问题，而是关系到企业变不变颜色的大问题。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众牢记伟大领袖毛主席教导的“自力更生”“勤俭建国”的道路，把节约一滴油，一度电，一寸钢材和一寸木材，提高到对伟大领袖毛主席忠不忠的高度。许多采掘队组的工人坚持下井不白走，上井不空手，把几年来丢在井下的破板、破链环、旧钻头、坑木等回收出井。许多机电队的工人开展了修旧利废活动，使许多死机变成了活机，使大批废旧物资又在生产中发挥了效能。群众性的勤俭节约运动，为国家节约了大批资金。红十矿运输队一个单位，今年第二季度就为国家节约资金五百五十多万元。这就保证这个矿在文化大革命期间，在没增加设备、劳力的条件下，生产出现了新高潮。
    最近，这个矿又召开了“抓革命，促生产”、“节约闹革命”誓师大会，会上狠批了一小撮走资派“贪大求洋”、“喜新厌旧”，大挖社会主义墙脚的资产阶级大少爷、败家子作风，把节约闹革命的群众运动推向了新高潮，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，勤俭办企业的新风尚正在大同煤矿形成。
    革命大批判摧毁了旧的机构
    波澜壮阔的革命大批判运动，越来越深刻地冲击着中国赫鲁晓夫推行的一整套反革命修正主义办企业路线，以及为这一路线服务的旧的上层建筑和旧机构，保证了矿山沿着毛主席指引的“精兵简政”的道路阔步前进。
    大同煤矿革命委员会在革命大批判中，因势利导，自觉地在大破反革命修正主义办企业路线的同时，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。重叠的行政机构打破了，崭新的机构在革命的暴风雨中诞生了。过去，大同煤矿组织庞杂，机构重叠，人浮于事的现象非常严重。据统计，原局机关就有二十八个部、处、室，一千多名干部。现在的机构只有“一室三部”，即革委会办公室、政治部、生产部、后勤部。下属各矿是“一室三组”。工作人员大大减少，局级机关减少三分之二，矿级机关减少四分之三。
    新的组织机构简单，办事人员少，有利于突出无产阶级政治，抵制资产阶级的腐蚀，促进人的思想革命化。各级革命委员会领导成员遵照毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”和“遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”的教导，经常深入基层，深入群众，站在阶级斗争的第一线，和广大革命群众一起参加学习班，开座谈会，开展谈心活动，大力宣传毛泽东思想，做深入细致的政治思想工作。
    大同煤矿各级革命委员会，都把搞好领导班子的思想革命化作为自身建设的重点。有的矿把生产指挥部搬到井下，每天轮流在井下值班，定期参加劳动，访问伤病人员，向群众征求意见，把自己置于群众之中，主动地自觉地接受工人群众的批评和监督。那里困难大，就到那里去；那里情况复杂，就到那里去；那里工作艰苦，就到那里去。时时、事事、处处都成为革命带头人，给广大群众作出了榜样。他们注意大节，也注意小节，特别注意生活作风不特殊化。有的矿规定，看戏不坐前五排，专留给工人群众；办公室打水扫地自己干；来信来访的人只要是找领导的，都要亲自接待。有的矿规定，到局里开会只要不是十分紧迫就不坐小汽车，一律步行或骑自行车。有的领导还亲自给井下工人送开水，在井下和工人促膝谈心。
    由于革委会领导成员作风的改变，也就更加紧密地联系了群众，密切了干群关系。广大革命群众都更加爱护、关怀、支持和帮助革委会，经常地对革委会的工作提出批评和建议。
    革命大批判在大同煤矿搞得热火朝天，它以雷霆万钧之力，推动着各项工作向前发展。目前，大同煤矿的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，决心进一步落实毛主席的最新指示，深入开展革命大批判，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
