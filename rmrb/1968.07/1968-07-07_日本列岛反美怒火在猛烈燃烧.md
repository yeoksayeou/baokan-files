Recently, workers, students, and people from various strata in Japan have been increasingly engaged in mass movements against American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries. From the foothills of Mount Fuji to the shores of the Pacific, from Tokyo to Kyushu, from the Japanese mainland to the U.S.-occupied Okinawa Island, the waves of anti-American struggle are surging. The frequent mass struggles across Japan are primarily directed against U.S. military bases in Japan and the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

In January of this year, people across Japan launched a fierce struggle against the entry of U.S. nuclear aircraft carriers into Japanese ports. In March, a mass movement erupted against the construction of an army hospital in the heart of Tokyo. In the past few months, struggles have broken out in Kyushu, Tokyo, and other places demanding the removal of the U.S. military base in Itazuke, the removal of the U.S. military ammunition depot in northern Kyushu, and opposition to the transportation of ammunition and aircraft fuel for the U.S. military. The struggle against the construction of the "New Tokyo International Airport" to serve the U.S. military, which began more than two years ago, continues to this day. All these mass struggles have dealt a powerful blow to American imperialism and its Japanese reactionary lackeys.

The development of the mass struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the demand for the removal of U.S. military bases in Japan indicates that the contradictions between the broad masses of the Japanese people and American imperialism and its lackeys are becoming increasingly sharp. It shows that the oppression and control imposed by American imperialism on the Japanese people through the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" are facing increasingly fierce resistance. It is known that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will expire in 1970. As this date approaches, the struggle among various political forces in Japan over the continuation or abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will become increasingly intense.

For more than twenty years since the war, American imperialism has been the overlord of Japan. American imperialism, relying on the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," has long kept Japan in a semi-occupied state, integrating Japan into its strategic plan to invade Asia, turning Japan into a base for its wars of aggression against Vietnam, China, Korea, and other Asian countries. Currently, U.S. nuclear-powered warships and other warships involved in the savage invasion of Vietnam frequently enter and exit Japanese ports, and U.S. B-52 bombers that bomb Vietnam are also stationed at bases in Okinawa. Japan has been tightly bound to the U.S. war chariot in Vietnam.

American imperialism controls Japan in military, political, and economic aspects, wantonly trampling on Japan's national sovereignty. American imperialism still unreasonably occupies the Japanese territory of Okinawa, which has a population of 800,000. Approximately 200 U.S. military bases and facilities are densely distributed across the small Japanese archipelago.

According to Japanese media reports, the United States has established 72 military bases in the most densely populated areas of Tokyo and its vicinity. U.S. military vehicles, ships, and aircraft freely roam Japan's territory, territorial waters, and airspace, causing countless disasters for the Japanese people. The incident on June 2 this year, where an F-4C fighter-bomber from the Itazuke U.S. Air Force Base crashed into a six-story building at Kyushu University in Fukuoka City, is just the latest example of the many disasters caused by U.S. military bases. The Japanese people, through their personal experiences, are increasingly aware that American imperialism, which controls Japan in military, political, and economic aspects, is the most vicious enemy of the Japanese nation. Only by thoroughly and completely driving American imperialism out of Japan can Japan truly achieve national independence, peace, and democracy.

The Sato government represents the most pro-American and reactionary forces in Japan. It loyally follows American imperialism's policies of aggression and war, shamelessly betraying the interests of the Japanese nation and serving American imperialism. This reactionary government, externally, crazily expands and colludes closely with American imperialism's lackeys, such as the Park Chung-hee clique in South Korea, the Suharto fascist military regime in Indonesia, the puppet regime in South Vietnam, and the Kuomintang bandits, suppressing the national liberation movements of various Asian countries. Internally, it intensifies the revival of militarism, incites war hysteria, and brutally suppresses the people. In the past two years, the leaders of the Sato government have openly boasted that even by 1970, they will ensure the continuation of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and have been vigorously promoting the idea that Japan's "security" depends on the U.S. "nuclear umbrella" and nuclear bases. The pro-American, traitorous Sato reactionary government has completely placed itself in a position fundamentally opposed to the interests of the Japanese nation and cannot help but face increasingly strong opposition from the broad masses of the Japanese people. Under the impact of the increasingly fierce anti-American tide, the days of the Japanese reactionaries are getting tougher.

The escalating anti-American patriotic struggle of the Japanese people reflects the rapidly rising political awareness of the Japanese working class, laboring peasants, and progressive intellectuals. The treacherous face of the Miyamoto revisionist clique, which pretends to be anti-imperialist and revolutionary, has been increasingly exposed and unmasked by more and more Japanese people. For a long time, this traitorous clique has shouted slogans like "oppose American imperialism" but has never dared to touch a single hair of American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries. Moreover, whenever Japanese workers, peasants, and patriotic students rise up against the Japanese and American reactionaries, they slander and curse the revolutionary masses. The Miyamoto clique claims to advocate the "abolition" of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," but they are terrified of the revolutionary masses' struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Recently, the Miyamoto clique has repeatedly propagated that as long as their so-called "unified front government" issues a "notice" to the U.S. government in 1970 announcing the "termination" of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the treaty will naturally be "abolished," and thus, the U.S. military bases spread across the entire Japanese territory will be "withdrawn." It is clear that the Miyamoto clique spreads such nonsense to lull the Japanese people into complacency, to undermine the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle, and thus to help American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries. Therefore, it is not accidental that the Miyamoto clique's anti-revolutionary statements and treacherous actions have recently been repeatedly applauded and praised by the leaders of the Sato government. However, the more this group of revisionists brazenly betrays and sabotages the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle, the more they expose their own traitorous faces, and the more they are despised by the revolutionary people of Japan.

Now, the situation of the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Japanese people and the people of various Asian countries is very good. On the battlefield in Vietnam, American imperialism has already fallen deeply into the vast sea of people's war. The revolutionary storm of the Asian people against American imperialism and its lackeys is rapidly developing and unstoppable. The flames of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle are burning more fiercely.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow American imperialism to ride on its head for long."

The great Japanese people are further awakening and taking action, tightening the noose around the neck of American imperialism. The day when the American aggressors are driven out of Japanese territory will surely come.

### 日本列岛反美怒火在猛烈燃烧

    日本列岛反美怒火在猛烈燃烧
    最近以来，日本的工人、学生和其他各阶层人民反对美帝国主义和日本反动派的群众运动日益发展。从富士山麓到太平洋之滨，从东京到九州，从日本本土到美军霸占下的冲绳岛，反美斗争的浪潮奔腾激荡。日本各地频繁爆发的群众斗争，锋芒主要指向美国在日军事基地和日美“安全条约”。
    今年一月，日本各地人民展开了反对美国核航空母舰驶进日本港口的勇猛斗争。三月，掀起了反对美国在东京市中心修建陆军医院的群众运动。最近一两个月来，在九州、东京等地又爆发了要求撤除美军板付基地、撤除美军北九州弹药库、反对为美军运输弹药和飞机燃料的斗争。两年多以前就开始的、反对兴建为美军服务的东京“新国际机场”的群众斗争，更是一浪接着一浪，一直持续到现在。所有这些群众斗争，有力地打击了美帝国主义及其走狗日本反动派。
    反对日美“安全条约”和要求撤除美国在日军事基地的群众斗争的发展，表明日本广大人民同美帝国主义及其走狗之间的矛盾日益尖锐化，表明美帝国主义以日美“安全条约”为工具对日本人民实行的压迫和控制遭到越来越猛烈的反抗。人们知道，日美“安全条约”将于一九七○年满期，随着这个日期的逐渐临近，日本各种政治力量围绕着日美“安全条约”的存废问题而展开的斗争将越来越激烈。
    战后二十多年来，美帝国主义一直是日本的太上皇。美帝国主义不仅依靠日美“安全条约”长期把日本置于半占领状态下，把日本纳入它侵略亚洲的战略计划，使日本变成了它侵略越南、中国、朝鲜和亚洲其他国家的战争基地。目前，在越南进行野蛮侵略的美国核动力军舰和其他军舰频繁地进出于日本的港口，轰炸越南的美国B—52轰炸机也驻进了冲绳基地。日本已经被美帝国主义牢牢地捆在它的侵越战车之上。
    美帝国主义从军事、政治到经济，紧紧地控制着日本，放肆地蹂躏日本的民族主权。美帝国主义至今仍然无理霸占着拥有八十万人口的日本领土冲绳岛。大约有二百处美国军事基地和军事设施密密麻麻地分布在狭小的日本国土上。
    据日本报刊报道，美国在东京及其附近人口最稠密的地区，竟然设下了七十二个军事基地。美国的军车、军舰和军用飞机在日本的领土、领海、领空横冲直闯，给日本人民造成了无数的祸害。今年六月二日，板付美国空军基地的一架F—4C战斗轰炸机在福冈市九州大学六层建筑物上坠毁的事件，不过是许许多多由美军基地带来的灾难的最近一个例子而已。日本人民从切身遭遇中，越来越清楚地认识到，从军事、政治和经济各方面控制着日本的美帝国主义，是日本民族的最凶恶的敌人，只有把美帝国主义彻底、干净地赶出日本去，才有可能真正实现日本的民族独立、和平和民主。
      日本佐藤政府代表日本最亲美、最反动的势力。它死心塌地追随美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，无耻地出卖日本民族利益，为美帝国主义效劳。这个反动政府对外疯狂扩张，并同美帝国主义的走狗，南朝鲜朴正熙集团、印尼苏哈托法西斯军人政权、南越傀儡政权以及蒋介石匪帮等等，紧密勾结，镇压亚洲各国民族解放运动。它对内加紧复活军国主义，煽动战争歇斯底里，疯狂镇压人民。近两年来，佐藤政府的头目公开叫嚣，即使到了一九七○年也要使日美“安全条约”继续下去，并且大肆宣传日本的“安全”要依靠美国的“核保护伞”和核基地。亲美卖国的佐藤反动政府完全把自己置于同日本民族利益根本对立的地位，不能不受到日本广大人民越来越强烈的反对。在日益猛烈的反美浪潮的冲击下，日本反动派的日子越来越不好过了。
      日本人民反美爱国斗争的日益高涨，反映了日本的工人阶级、劳动农民和进步知识分子的政治觉悟正在迅速提高。宫本修正主义集团假反帝、假革命的丑恶面目已经被越来越多的日本人民所识破，所揭穿。长期以来，这个叛徒集团口头上空喊“反对美帝国主义”，实际上不但根本不敢触动美帝国主义和日本反动派一根毫毛，而且每当日本的工人、农民和爱国学生起来造日美反动派的反的时候，他们就对革命群众大肆诬蔑和咒骂。宫本之流口口声声地说，他们是主张“废除”日美“安全条约”的，但是却对革命群众反对日美“安全条约”的斗争怕得要死。最近，宫本之流一再宣传，只要他们所幻想的所谓“统一战线政府”在一九七○年向美国政府发出宣布“终止”日美“安全条约”的一纸“通知”，这个条约就自然“废除”，这样一来，那遍布日本全土的美军基地也就会“撤除”。很明显，宫本之流散布这种奇谈怪论，就是为了麻痹日本人民的警惕性，瓦解日本人民反美爱国斗争，从而为美帝国主义和日本反动派帮忙。因此，最近以来，宫本集团的反对革命的言论和叛卖行径，一再博得佐藤政府头目们的喝采和夸奖，绝不是偶然的。但是，这一伙修正主义分子越是猖狂地叛卖和破坏日本人民反美爱国斗争，就越清楚地暴露出他们自己的叛徒面目，从而遭到日本革命人民的唾弃。
    现在，日本人民和亚洲各国人民群众反美爱国斗争的形势非常好。在越南战场上，美帝国主义已经深深地陷入人民战争的汪洋大海里。亚洲各国人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的革命风暴，正在迅猛发展，势不可挡。日本人民反美爱国斗争的烈火越烧越旺。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席曾经指出：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”
    伟大的日本人民正在进一步觉醒起来，行动起来，拉紧套在美帝国主义脖子上的绞索。美国侵略者被从日本国土上驱逐出去的日子是一定要到来的。
