The revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," which shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, is a gem in the treasure house of proletarian literature and a masterpiece in the history of human arts. We revolutionary soldiers love to watch such a wonderful ballet, the more we watch, the more we want to watch.

The revolutionary modern ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" was born under the guidance of the brilliant thoughts of our great leader Chairman Mao, "learn from the past to serve the present, learn from abroad to serve China," and under the direct guidance and painstaking cultivation of Comrade Jiang Qing. It was created through the efforts of the revolutionary comrades of the ballet troupe in the midst of fierce struggles between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. With the force of a thunderbolt, it swept away the evil winds and mists on the ballet stage, driving away the ghosts of foreign kings, princes, and lovers that were brought in by the Chinese Khrushchev. It wrote a brilliant new chapter in the history of world ballet with its proletarian revolutionary political content and perfect artistic form, setting a shining example for the revolution of ballet.

This six-act ballet fully depicts the vast and tumultuous struggle of the workers and peasants' Red Army during the Second Revolutionary Civil War. It successfully portrays the towering images of the proletarian revolutionary heroes Hong Chungheng and Wu Qinghua, and praises the great achievements of the workers and peasants' Red Army created by Chairman Mao. Hong Chungheng in the play is a proletarian revolutionary soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought, a good son of the poor people. In battle, to effectively annihilate the enemy, he bravely ventures into the lion's den, directly attacking the den of the southern bandits. This shows Hong Chungheng's wisdom and bravery, daring to rush forward even in the face of knife mountains and fire seas for the revolution. On the battlefield of bullets and shells, to achieve overall victory in the battle, he voluntarily takes on the most arduous and dangerous sniper mission, fighting bravely and tenaciously, defending the position, and fighting to the death. This reflects Hong Chungheng's proletarian spirit of steel and his noble quality of fearlessness in sacrifice for the revolution. On the enemy's execution ground, he remains calm and composed, facing death with equanimity. In his last moments, he thinks not of his own safety but of the entire revolutionary cause. In his ears, he hears the victory song of the Red Detachment of Women, "Forward, forward," and before his eyes, he sees the magnificent scene of the main force of the Red Army sweeping away thousands of enemies, pursuing and annihilating the enemy, and liberating all of China.

"Beheading is nothing to fear, as long as the cause is true; killing one of us, there will be more to follow," expresses Hong Chungheng's far-reaching revolutionary ideals and heroic spirit of facing death with composure, and expresses his revolutionary enthusiasm.

The other heroine in the play, Wu Qinghua, is a poor child who has suffered endless persecution and humiliation. She represents the countless impoverished working women of old China. The ballet depicts her growth from a spontaneous individual rebel to a conscious proletarian heroine under the party's nurturing and education, from a naive class consciousness of revenge to a communist worldview of self-sacrifice for the liberation of all of China and all of humanity. Under the brutal oppression of Nan Bati, she suffered endless torture. But whips and dungeons did not subdue her; instead, they aroused her deep hatred and fierce anger towards the class enemy. She wanted to rebel, to take revenge. In anger, she kicked over the running dog Lao Si and rushed out the door. Unfortunately, she fell back into Nan Bati's clutches. At the most critical moment, it was the party that saved Wu Qinghua and guided her onto the revolutionary path. In the revolutionary school of the Red Detachment of Women, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, the deeply wronged Wu Qinghua grew rapidly. She came to understand the great truth that "the proletariat not only liberates itself but also liberates all of humanity," and established a thorough revolutionary ideal. In the sniper battle, she defended the position with her deep hatred for the class enemy, bravely fighting the enemy. When the bullets ran out, she led her comrades in a fierce hand-to-hand struggle with the enemy. With an overwhelming heroic spirit, she repelled the enemy's numerous ferocious attacks and successfully completed the mission, joining the Communist Party of China on the battlefield. In the battle to liberate the coconut grove, Wu Qinghua bravely led the charge, entering the bandit's lair and killing the evil bandit Nan Bati, who was fighting to the death. After Hong Chungheng's glorious sacrifice, Wu Qinghua bravely took up the revolutionary burden left by Hong Chungheng, holding high the banner of struggle, treading on the blood of the martyrs, and leading the Red Detachment of Women to continue forward. Wu Qinghua, this shining image of a proletarian revolutionary female soldier, is a representative of revolutionary women nurtured under Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary path that Wu Qinghua took is the common path that all oppressed women must take.

Watching the ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," we feel as if we are not in the theater but right there with the heroes, fighting together. The towering images of Hong Chungheng and Wu Qinghua are deeply engraved in our hearts, making us deeply understand that the proletarian dictatorship is hard-won; inspiring us to never forget class struggle and proletarian dictatorship; always remembering that three-quarters of the laboring masses in the world are still not liberated; and encouraging us to forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution, dedicating our lives to the cause of human liberation.

However, for a long time, the field of ballet has been controlled by a counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line. The Chinese Khrushchev and the likes of Zhou Yang have been madly advocating capitalist and feudal art. They loudly proclaim that ballet must be "foreign to the core" and "learned to perfection," allowing some foreign talents and beauties to occupy our socialist literary stage. Even more viciously, they have been trying every means to oppose the portrayal of workers, peasants, and soldiers as heroes. They say nonsense like "heroes all have flaws" and "writing about advanced figures does not mean they have to be perfect," and they advocate writing about "middle figures," which is actually writing about backward figures. They advocate writing about heroes' "errors in stance" and "flaws in character," scheming to blacken the faces of proletarian heroes and distort them into despicable, petty bourgeois "little people." They even advocate writing about heroes having "three minutes of wavering" before their glorious sacrifice. This reactionary literary fallacy is essentially a replica of the traitor philosophy and survival philosophy of the Chinese Khrushchev. The Chinese Khrushchev has always advocated that "Communist Party members should love themselves" and "protect their lives and health," saying nonsense like "the party, under possible conditions, should give up some of its work to preserve comrades," and even shamelessly saying that those who kneel before the enemy and crawl out of dog holes are merely due to "a moment of weakness." This is extremely reactionary! This is the greatest insult to Communist Party members and the greatest slander against proletarian revolutionary heroes!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai; to die for the fascists, to die for the exploiters and oppressors of the people, is lighter than a feather." We revolutionary soldiers deeply understand: on the issue of life and death, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie have two diametrically opposed views and practices. Under the enemy's butcher's knife, one is either a revolutionary hero or a revolutionary traitor, with no middle ground. Hong Chungheng, the proletarian revolutionary hero armed with Mao Zedong Thought, faces the enemy's butcher's knife with unyielding courage and fearlessness, which is the most powerful criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev's survival philosophy and traitor philosophy. It is also a devastating blow to the reactionary "middle figure" theory.

"Looking at the heroes of the past, let's see today's heroes." Heroes like Hong Chungheng and Wu Qinghua are in the thousands and tens of thousands in our socialist country. Such as Dong Cunrui, who sacrificed himself to blow up a fortress for national liberation; Huang Jiguang, who used his chest to block the enemy's gun barrel to open the road to victory for the troops and defeat the American aggressors; Wang Jie, who bravely threw himself onto a bomb to protect the lives of his class brothers; and Men He, who sacrificed himself to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line....

They are all nurtured under Mao Zedong Thought. The Hong Chungheng and Wu Qinghua on the ballet stage are the concentrated representatives of countless heroes in real life. They come from real life and are higher than real life. They are excellent examples for all the people of the nation to learn from, and their shining images will forever inspire us to move forward!

Let us shout: Long live the revolutionary heroes of the proletariat!

    无产阶级的革命英雄万岁
    中国人民解放军某部　卢韦　李卫　张忠
    闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》，是无产阶级文艺宝库中的明珠，是人类文艺史上的珍品。我们革命战士对这样好的芭蕾舞剧，越看越爱看，越看越想看。
    革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》，是在我们伟大领袖毛主席“古为今用，洋为中用”的光辉思想照耀下，在敬爱的江青同志的直接指导和辛勤培育下，经过芭蕾舞剧团革命同志们的努力，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中诞生的。它以雷霆万钧之力，横扫芭蕾舞台上的妖风迷雾，把中国赫鲁晓夫招来的洋帝王将相、洋才子佳人的幽灵，统统赶下了芭蕾舞台。它以无产阶级的革命的政治内容和完美的艺术形式，谱写了世界芭蕾舞史上灿烂的新篇章，为芭蕾舞革命树立了光辉的样板。
    这个六场芭蕾舞剧，充分地表现了第二次国内革命战争时期工农红军波澜壮阔的斗争生活；成功地塑造了洪常青、吴清华高大的无产阶级革命英雄形象；歌颂了毛主席亲手缔造的工农红军的丰功伟绩。剧中的洪常青是用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命战士，是穷苦人民的好儿子。在战斗中，为了有效地歼灭敌人，他冒着生命危险，深入虎穴，直捣南匪老窝。表现了洪常青机智勇敢，为革命刀山火海也敢扑上前的赤胆忠心。在枪林弹雨的战场上，为了取得战斗的全面胜利，他主动地承担最艰苦、最危险的狙击任务，英勇顽强，坚守阵地，浴血奋战。反映出洪常青的无产阶级硬骨头精神和为革命不怕牺牲的高尚品质。在敌人的刑场上，他脸不变色心不跳，从容镇定，视死如归。在生命的最后一刻，他想到的不是个人的安危，而是整个革命事业。耳际回响的是红色娘子军“向前进，向前进”的胜利凯歌，眼前展现出的是红军主力横扫千军，追歼敌人，解放全中国的壮丽图景。
  “砍头不要紧，只要主义真，杀了我一个，还有后来人”，写出了洪常青的远大革命理想和视死如归的英雄气概，抒发了洪常青的革命豪情。
    剧中描写的另一个英雄人物吴清华，是一个受尽迫害和欺凌的苦孩子，她是旧中国千千万万个穷苦劳动妇女的代表。舞剧描写她在党的培养教育下，由个人自发的反抗到成为自觉的无产阶级英雄战士，由报仇雪恨的朴素阶级意识到确立为解放全中国，解放全人类而献身的共产主义世界观的成长过程。她在南霸天的残酷压迫下，受尽了折磨。但是，皮鞭、地牢并没有使她屈服，相反地激起了她对阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨和满腔怒火。她要反抗，要报仇，她愤怒地踢倒狗腿子老四，夺门而走。但不幸又重新落入了南霸天的魔掌。在最危急的时刻，是党救了吴清华，并指引她走上了革命的道路。在红色娘子军这个革命大学校里，在毛泽东思想的哺育下，苦大仇深的吴清华迅速地成长起来。她认识到：“无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类”的伟大真理，树立了彻底革命的理想。在狙击战斗中，她带着对阶级敌人的无比仇恨坚守阵地，英勇杀敌。子弹打光了，她带领着同志们和敌人展开激烈的肉搏。以压倒一切敌人的英雄气概，打退了敌人的数次猖狂进攻，胜利地完成了任务，在火线上光荣地加入中国共产党。在解放椰林寨的战斗中，吴清华奋勇争先，冲入匪巢，击毙了负隅顽抗的万恶匪徒南霸天。洪常青光荣牺牲后，吴清华勇敢地挑起了洪常青留下的革命重担，高举战斗的红旗，踏着烈士的血迹，率领着红色娘子军继续前进。吴清华这位无产阶级革命女战士的光辉形象，是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的革命妇女的代表。吴清华所走的革命道路，就是一切被压迫妇女要走的共同道路。
    观看芭蕾舞《红色娘子军》，我们仿佛不是身在剧场，而是亲临其境和英雄在一起共同战斗。洪常青、吴清华的高大英雄形象深深铭刻在我们的心坎上，使我们深深懂得，无产阶级的政权来之不易；激励我们念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政；时刻想着世界上三分之二的劳苦大众还没有解放；鼓舞我们永远跟着毛主席干革命，为人类的解放事业贡献出自己的一生。
    可是长期以来，芭蕾舞这个阵地，一直被一条反革命修正主义文艺黑线控制着。中国赫鲁晓夫和周扬之流疯狂地提倡资本主义、封建主义的艺术。他们大肆叫嚷芭蕾舞要“洋到底”“学到家”，让一些洋才子洋佳人，占领我们社会主义的文艺舞台，更加恶毒的是，他们还千方百计地反对表现工农兵英雄人物。胡说什么“英雄都是有缺点的”，“写先进人物不能说一定要完美无缺的”等等，他们大肆鼓吹写“中间人物”，实际上是写落后人物。他们提倡写英雄人物要写他们“立场上的错误”，“品质上的缺点”，处心积虑地往无产阶级英雄脸上抹黑，妄图把无产阶级英雄形象丑化为卑鄙、猥琐的资产阶级“小人物”。他们甚至主张写英雄人物壮烈牺牲前，也要写他有“三分钟的动摇”。这种反动的文艺谬论，实质上就是中国赫鲁晓夫的叛徒哲学、活命哲学的翻版。中国赫鲁晓夫一贯鼓吹“共产党员要钟爱自己”，
  “要保护自己的生命和健康”，胡说什么
  “党在可能的条件下”，“要放弃党的一些工作来保存同志”，甚至恬不知耻地说那些在敌人面前屈膝投降，从狗洞里爬出来的卑鄙叛徒，也仅仅由于“一念之差”，真是反动透顶！这是对共产党员的最大的侮辱，这是对无产阶级革命英雄的最大的污蔑！
    毛主席教导我们说：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。”我们革命战士深深懂得：对待生和死的问题，无产阶级和资产阶级有着截然相反的两种观点，两种做法。在敌人的屠刀下，不是做革命的英雄，就是当革命的叛徒，决没有中间道路可走。洪常青这个用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级的革命英雄，在敌人的屠刀下，大义凛然，临危不惧的气概，就是对中国赫鲁晓夫活命哲学、叛徒哲学的最有力的批判。也是对反动的“中间人物”论的毁灭性的一击。
      “数风流人物，还看今朝。”象洪常青、吴清华这样的英雄，在我们社会主义的国家里，是成千成万的。如为了民族的解放，舍身炸碉堡的董存瑞；为了给部队开辟胜利的道路，打败美国强盗，用自己胸口挡住了敌人枪眼的黄继光；为了保护阶级兄弟的生命安全，英勇地扑向炸药包的王杰；为捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而英勇献身的门合……。他们都是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的。芭蕾舞台上的洪常青、吴清华，他们是现实生活中无数英雄人物的集中代表，他们来自现实生活，又高于现实生活。他们是我们全国人民学习的好榜样，他们的光辉形象将永远鼓舞着我们前进！
    让我们高呼：无产阶级的革命英雄万岁！
