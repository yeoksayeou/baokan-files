After the publication of the oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan," readers have sent in numerous letters, enthusiastically praising this moving depiction of Chairman Mao's glorious image in his youth.

When we see this oil painting, it is as if we are witnessing our great teacher stepping onto the majestic Jinggang Mountains; as if we are seeing the great leader crossing rivers and mountains to head north to Yan'an; as if we are seeing the great commander-in-chief turning the tide and driving out Japanese imperialism; as if we are seeing the great helmsman commanding thousands of troops to bury the Chiang Kai-shek regime completely. Great leader Chairman Mao, for the liberation of the Chinese people, traversed every mountain and river in the motherland. We will definitely follow the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao and march forward, forever forward.

A storm rolls in, covering the entire sky with dark clouds. In 1921, the miners of Anyuan were waiting for their savior. Suddenly, a clap of thunder, and Chairman Mao rushed into the midst of the miners. From that moment on, the workers of Anyuan, the Chinese working class, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, took control of their own destiny and marched from victory to victory.

The vast coal sea stretches endlessly, and Chairman Mao's heart is connected with the people of Anyuan. In 1921, our beloved leader Chairman Mao, who founded the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, did not hesitate to walk to Anyuan. Chairman Mao, with a radiant appearance, full of passion, and covered in dust, walked towards Anyuan. Look! That broad forehead, full of boundless wisdom; those bright eyes, penetrating the winds of the five continents; that resolute demeanor, with fearless spirit; that expansive chest, containing the whole world; that firm fist, showing unyielding confidence; that powerful stride, shaking the heavens and earth for ten thousand miles. Chairman Mao, dressed in a long robe, carrying an umbrella, wearing cloth shoes, came to the workers' side. The "coal blackies" finally saw the light, and the proletariat began their journey towards liberation. Revolutionary people, looking at this oil painting, feel their hearts stirred and their fighting spirit soar, becoming even more determined to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

  我们看到这幅油画，仿佛看到了我们伟大导师当年踏上巍巍井冈山的雄姿；仿佛看到了伟大领袖跨越万水千山北上延安的英勇气概；仿佛看到了伟大统帅力挽狂澜，赶跑日本帝国主义的光辉形象；仿佛看到了伟大舵手指挥千军万马彻底埋葬蒋家王朝的磅礴气势。伟大领袖毛主席，为了中国人民的解放，踏遍了祖国的千山万水，我们一定沿着毛主席指引的方向，永远向前，永远向前。

    狂飙卷着乌云，布满了整个天空。一九二一年的安源矿工们在盼望着救星。这时，平地一声春雷，毛主席疾步来到了矿工中间。安源工人、中国工人阶级，从此在伟大领袖毛主席领导下，掌握了自己的命运，从胜利走向胜利。

    滔滔煤海大无边，毛主席和安源人民心相连。一九二一年，我们敬爱的领袖毛主席，缔造起伟大光荣正确的中国共产党，就不辞艰辛地步行来到安源。毛主席英姿焕发、豪情满怀、风尘仆仆地向安源走来。看！那宽大的前额，富有无限智慧；那闪亮的眼睛，洞察五洲风云；那坚毅的神态，有着无畏的精神；那广阔的胸襟，装得下整个世界；那刚劲的铁拳，显示出必胜的信心；那雄健的步伐，震撼着万里乾坤。毛主席身着长衫，带着雨伞，蹬着布鞋，来到工人身边。“煤黑子”从此见了天，无产阶级从此走上了解放的道路。革命人民看着这幅油画，心情激动，斗志昂扬，更加坚定了夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的信心。
