The Italian people's struggle against the oppression and exploitation of the monopoly bourgeoisie continues to surge. In southern Italy's Sicily region, a powerful wave of strikes has erupted, paralyzing many towns. On the 5th, 30,000 small farmers from all over the country gathered in the capital, Rome, to protest against the government's reactionary agricultural policies.

On the 4th, workers in Palermo, the capital of Sicily, held a general strike demanding full employment and wage increases. Factories, construction sites, shops, offices, and cinemas in Palermo were all closed, port operations ceased, public transportation stopped, and three newspapers could not be published. The capital of Sicily was completely paralyzed.

More than 12,000 workers from various industries held a demonstration in the center of Palermo. Large numbers of unemployed workers, suburban farmers, and earthquake victims joined the procession. Their placards read, "No to starvation wages" and slogans condemning the government.

This year, as the general political and economic crisis of the capitalist world deepens, the competition among monopoly capitalists for domestic and foreign markets has become increasingly fierce. The economic situation in relatively backward regions like Sicily in Italy has seriously worsened. Recently, the Italian government and capitalists have used various pretexts to lay off large numbers of workers and close factories in this region. In Palermo alone, dozens of enterprises have been forced to shut down. The Palermo shipyard, which originally had 7,000 workers, laid off 3,500; the number of construction workers dropped from 15,000 to 5,000. Of the 20,000 workers who still have jobs, 60% are facing the threat of unemployment. The severe earthquake that struck the Sicily region at the beginning of this year has added to the suffering of the working people.

Recently, the working people of Sicily have been continuously fighting back. Workers at the Palermo shipyard have been on strike for nearly two months to protest "starvation wages" and layoffs. Workers in transportation, sanitation, water supply, and government employees in Palermo also went on strike. On the 2nd, unemployed workers in Sant'Agata di Militello stormed the local unemployment office and fought with the police who came to suppress them. The police chief was also injured by the angry unemployed workers. On the 1st, more than ten towns in the provinces of Trapani and Agrigento saw massive strikes, with 100,000 workers and residents taking to the streets, paralyzing these towns.

Meanwhile, Italian farmers have launched a new wave of struggle. On the morning of the 5th, 30,000 small farmers from all over Italy rushed to Rome and held a demonstration in the city center, protesting against the government's agricultural policies that harm the interests of small farmers. Their placards carried slogans condemning the monopoly capitalists for harming the interests of small farmers. This demonstration disrupted traffic in the Rome area for several hours.

In southern Italy's Cosenza, 1,000 small farmers held a demonstration on the 3rd to protest against the government's low prices for agricultural products. Not long ago, small farmers in Lecco, Emilia-Romagna, in northern Italy, also held a demonstration for the same reason.

    意大利人民反垄断资本斗争继续发展
    西西里岛爆发罢工，许多城镇陷于瘫痪
    三万农民汇集罗马，抗议反动农业政策
    新华社六日讯　罗马消息：意大利人民反对垄断资产阶级的压迫和剥削的斗争浪潮此伏彼起，继续高涨。意大利南部的西西里区爆发了强大的罢工怒潮，许多城镇因此陷于瘫痪状态。三万小农五日从全国各地汇集到首都罗马举行示威，抗议政府的农业政策。
    西西里区首府巴勒莫的工人四日举行总罢工，要求充分就业和增加工资。巴勒莫市的工厂、工地、商店、机关和电影院统统关了门，港口停止卸货，市内交通停顿，三家报纸都无法出版。这个西西里岛的首府完全陷于瘫痪状态。
    一万二千多名各行业的工人四日在巴勒莫市中心举行了示威游行。大批失业工人、郊区的农民和地震的灾民参加了示威的行列。他们手中的标语牌上写着：“不要饥饿工资”，以及谴责政府的口号。
    今年来，随着资本主义世界政治经济总危机的加深，垄断资本争夺国内外市场的竞争日益激烈，意大利的西西里等比较落后的地区的经济状况严重恶化。最近，意大利政府和资本家利用种种借口，在这个地区大量解雇工人，关闭工厂。仅在巴勒莫市，就强行关闭了几十家企业。巴勒莫造船厂原有七千工人，解雇了三千五百人；建筑工业工人人数也从一万五千人降为五千人。现在暂时还有活干的二万工人，其中也有百分之六十受到失业的严重威胁。今年年初在西西里区爆发的剧烈的地震，加重了劳动人民的痛苦。
    西西里区的劳动人民，最近不断地起来斗争。巴勒莫造船厂的工人为了抗议“饥饿工资”和解雇工人的罢工斗争已坚持了将近两个月。巴勒莫市的运输、清洁和自来水工人以及政府职员也举行了罢工。圣卢卡市的失业工人二日冲进了当地的失业登记处，并同前来镇压的警察进行搏斗。圣卢卡的警察头子也被愤怒的失业工人打伤。特拉巴尼省和阿格里琴托省的十多个城镇一日爆发了声势浩大的罢工，十万工人和居民举行了示威游行，使这些城镇陷于瘫痪状态。
    与此同时，意大利农民掀起了新的斗争的浪潮。五日清晨，三万小农从意大利各地赶到罗马，在市中心举行示威游行，反对政府推行损害小农利益的农业政策。他们举着的标语牌上写着谴责垄断资本损害小农利益的口号。这次示威游行使罗马市区的交通断绝了好几个小时。
    在意大利南部的科森萨，一千名小农三日举行了示威游行，抗议政府把农产品的价格压得太低。不久前，意大利北部的勒佐尼尔艾米利亚的小农，也为此举行了示威。
