Workers and students in various Latin American countries continue to engage in persistent struggles, protesting against the aggressive crimes of American imperialism and striving to improve the living conditions of laborers.

On July 14, workers at the largest slaughterhouse and cold storage plant in Buenos Aires, Argentina, "Lisandro de la Torre," went on strike to protest a new labor regulation imposed by the management. This regulation increased labor intensity, exacerbating the exploitation and oppression of workers, and threatened 30% of the workers with unemployment. Despite police suppression and obstruction from upper-level union officials, the workers resolutely rejected this "new regulation."

On July 16, 1,500 electricians at the Chilean state-owned railway company also went on strike, demanding the protection of their economic interests. On July 12, students in the capital city of Santiago held a demonstration, protesting against the U.S. invasion of Vietnam and expressing support for the heroic Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression. The demonstrating students renamed "New York Street" in the center of Santiago to "Hanoi Street."

Starting from July 16, teachers in Colombia began a series of strike actions, supporting the teachers in Santander province who were protesting the government's dismissal of 27 teachers and demanding improved economic conditions for teachers. One million teachers in the provinces of Cordoba, Choco, and La Guajira have decided to go on strike on July 16.

Recently, the people of the Dominican Republic threw bombs at the U.S. Information Service office and the Dominican-American Cultural Association in the capital, Santo Domingo, protesting against American imperialism's aggression in the Dominican Republic.

On July 14, over 700 students at the University of Canto in Lima, Peru, held a demonstration, demanding an increase in university education funds. The police suppressed the students' just struggle with gunshots and tear gas. The students retaliated with stones and Molotov cocktails, blocked the main streets leading to the university with stones, and occupied the university.
