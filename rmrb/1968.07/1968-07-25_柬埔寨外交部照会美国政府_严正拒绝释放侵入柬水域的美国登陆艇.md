The Cambodian Foreign Ministry has sent a note to the U.S. government, firmly rejecting the U.S. demand to release a U.S. landing craft that intruded into Cambodian waters on July 17 and was captured by the Royal Cambodian Navy.

According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on July 22, the Cambodian Foreign Ministry's note refutes the U.S. government's claim that the landing craft entered Cambodian waters due to a navigation error. The note points out that the U.S. has repeatedly used the excuse of navigation errors to cover up its incursions into Cambodian waters, which have resulted in the deaths and injuries of Cambodian border residents on multiple occasions. The note states that in recent months, U.S. forces have continuously intensified their deliberate provocations and acts of aggression against Cambodia. This latest intrusion by the U.S. landing craft is yet another deliberate provocation by the U.S. government, which disregards Cambodia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The note declares that the Royal Government of Cambodia will handle the U.S. landing craft and all personnel on board in accordance with Cambodian law.

    柬埔寨外交部照会美国政府
    严正拒绝释放侵入柬水域的美国登陆艇
    新华社金边二十四日电　据柬埔寨新闻社二十二日报道：柬埔寨外交部照会美国政府，断然拒绝美国政府要求释放十七日侵入柬埔寨水域而被柬埔寨王家海军军舰俘获的一艘美国登陆艇。
    照会驳斥了美国政府扬言这艘登陆艇是因航行错误而进入柬埔寨水域的荒谬说法。照会指出，美国以航行错误为借口来掩盖其侵犯柬埔寨水域的行动，已经不是第一次了。这种所谓的航行错误已经多次造成柬埔寨边境居民的死伤。照会指出，几个月来，美军不断强化对柬埔寨的蓄意挑衅和侵略的行动。这次美国登陆艇侵入柬埔寨水域，是美国政府无视柬埔寨主权和领土完整的又一个蓄意挑衅的行动。照会说，柬埔寨王国政府将根据柬埔寨法律的规定，对美国登陆艇及艇上的全部人员进行处理。
