Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," Jiangxi Province has once again achieved a bumper harvest of early and medium rice. Currently, both early and medium rice in the entire province have ripened and are being harvested on a large scale.

Along the Gan River, although this year's harvest was affected by floods, it still presents a scene of abundance.

At present, Jiangxi's rural areas are in the busy season of harvesting early and medium rice and transplanting late rice. Revolutionary committees at all levels insist on putting proletarian politics in command, with leading members personally going to the front lines. They lead the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to the summer harvest and summer planting sites, working together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members. On one hand, they ensure the harvest and storage of early and medium rice to guarantee a bumper harvest; on the other hand, they spare no effort to promote the planting of late rice, striving for a bumper harvest for the entire year.

    江西省的早稻和中稻又获得好收成
    在伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的指引下，江西全省又夺得了早稻和中稻丰收。现在，全省早中稻都已黄熟，正在全面开镰收割。
    赣江沿岸，今年虽然受到洪水侵袭，但仍呈现一派丰收景象。
    目前，江西农村正是早中稻收割和晚稻插秧的大忙季节。各级革命委员会都坚持无产阶级政治挂帅，领导成员亲自到第一线，带领毛泽东思想宣传队深入夏收夏种现场，同广大贫下中农和社员群众一道，一面做好早中稻的收获工作，保证丰产丰收，颗粒归仓；一面千方百计抓紧多种晚稻，争取全年农业的大丰收。
