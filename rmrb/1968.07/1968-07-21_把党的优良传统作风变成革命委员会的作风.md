Recently, I have studied again Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on revolutionary committees and the important editorial published on July 1st in the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *Liberation Army Daily*. By linking this with my own experience in participating in the work of the revolutionary committee, I have deeply felt that maintaining close ties with the masses, taking root among the masses, and serving the people wholeheartedly are the fine traditions and work styles that our Party has always advocated. As a member of the revolutionary committee representing the People's Liberation Army, how to bring the Party's fine tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses into the revolutionary committee is indeed a very important issue.

Last year, when our school's revolutionary committee was just established, we encountered a problem: what kind of work organization should the revolutionary committee establish? At first, we did not consult the masses but just sat in the office and closed the door to come up with a plan for the revolutionary committee to set up several large groups. This plan had a large organization and many personnel. When it was handed over to the masses, it was opposed. Some comrades pointed out bluntly: this is a plan to restore the old system.

The opposition from the broad revolutionary teachers and students sounded an alarm for us, making us realize that if we acted according to this plan, the revolutionary committee would not be able to maintain close ties with the masses, could not timely reflect the wishes and demands of the masses, and thus could not become a revolutionary, vigorous, and combative command center. Later, we followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "from the masses, to the masses," and mobilized the masses to discuss extensively. In the discussion, the masses, based on Chairman Mao's instruction that the revolutionary committee must "streamline administration and reduce personnel," proposed a plan to reduce the upper-level organization and strengthen the grassroots forces. This plan was warmly supported and endorsed by the broad revolutionary teachers and students. They happily said: this truly reflects the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat.

This incident gave us a great education. We felt that the revolutionary committee is a new thing created by the broad masses in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It has such strong vitality precisely because it represents the fundamental interests of the broad revolutionary masses and maintains close ties with the masses. Inheriting and carrying forward the Party's traditions, not leaving the masses for a single moment, this should be the principle that must be followed in all the work of the revolutionary committee, and it is also the most fundamental issue in the consolidation and construction of the revolutionary committee. Solving the organizational problem of the revolutionary committee only ensures organizational ties with the masses; more importantly, how to make every member of the revolutionary committee truly establish the thought style of maintaining close ties with the masses.

With this question in mind, we organized all the comrades of the revolutionary committee to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "serving the people wholeheartedly and never leaving the masses." Everyone further realized that whether the revolutionary committee can maintain close ties with the masses is a major issue related to whether we can faithfully execute Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. It is also a fundamental issue related to whether our proletarian dictatorship will change color. With heightened awareness, everyone in the work would consciously and actively connect with the masses and consult with the masses on matters.

In April this year, according to Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," we further exposed the class struggle within our school and unearthed a handful of class enemies hiding in the revolutionary ranks. How to guide the masses to push the struggle to clean up the class ranks to a new high tide? Our revolutionary committee followed Chairman Mao's teachings and went to various classes to listen to the opinions of the masses extensively. The majority of the masses believed that carrying out revolutionary criticism is Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and is the fundamental task throughout the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which must never be relaxed. The current struggle to clean up the class ranks in the school must be combined with revolutionary criticism to further raise the class struggle consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle of the broad masses, and to expose all the bad elements. Through extensive contact with the masses, the comrades of the revolutionary committee deeply felt that as long as we go to the masses and humbly seek their advice, all problems can be solved.

Facts have repeatedly educated us: our revolutionary committee can only build itself into a revolutionary, mass-oriented, and authoritative leadership organization of the proletarian revolution by never leaving the masses for a moment and truly turning the Party's fine traditions and work styles into the style of the revolutionary committee.

    把党的优良传统作风变成革命委员会的作风
    北京十四中革委会主任　郭永良
    最近，我重新学习了毛主席关于革命委员会的一系列最新指示，学习了《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》七月一日发表的重要社论，联系自己参加革委会工作以来的斗争实践，深深地体会到：密切联系群众，扎根在群众之中，全心全意为群众服务，是毛主席一贯倡导的我们党的优良传统作风。作为参加革委会的解放军代表，如何把党的紧密联系群众的优良作风，带到革命委员会中来，确实是一个十分重要的问题。
    去年，在我们学校的革委会刚刚成立的时候，遇到一个问题：革委会应该建立一个什么样的工作机构？起初，我们没有和群众商量，只是几个常委坐在办公室里闭门造车，提出一个革委会下设几个大组的方案。这个方案，机构庞大，人员众多。一交给群众，就遭到了反对。有的同志一针见血地指出：这是一个复旧的方案。
    广大革命师生的反对，给我们敲起了警钟，使我们认识到：按照这个方案办事，势必使得革命委员会不能密切联系群众，不能及时反映群众的愿望和要求，也就不能成为革命的、朝气蓬勃的战斗指挥部。后来，我们遵照毛主席“从群众中来，到群众中去”的教导，发动群众广泛讨论。在讨论中，群众根据毛主席关于革命委员会必须“精兵简政”的指示，提出了一个缩小上层机构，充实基层力量的方案。这个方案得到了广大革命师生的热烈拥护和支持。他们高兴地说：这才真正体现了无产阶级的革命精神。
    这件事给了我们很大的教育。我们感到：革命委员会是在无产阶级文化大革命中广大群众创造的新事物。它所以具有强大的生命力，最根本的一条，就是因为它代表广大革命群众的根本利益，同群众保持着密切的联系。继承和发扬党的传统作风，一时一刻不脱离群众，这应该是革委会的一切工作中必须遵循的原则，也是革委会的巩固和建设中一个最根本的问题。解决了革委会的机构问题，仅仅从组织上保证了革委会同群众的密切联系；更重要的是，如何使革委会的每一个成员，都真正树立起紧密联系群众的思想作风。
    带着这个问题，我们组织革委会的全体同志学习了毛主席关于“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”的教导。大家进一步认识到：革委会能不能紧密联系群众，这是关系到能不能忠实执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署的重大问题，也是关系到我们的无产阶级专政的政权会不会改变颜色的根本问题。认识提高了，大家在工作中就能自觉地主动地联系群众，有事同群众商量。
    今年四月，根据毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，进一步揭开了我们学校里阶级斗争的盖子，揪出了隐藏在革命队伍里的一小撮阶级敌人。如何引导群众把清理阶级队伍的斗争推向新的高潮呢？我们革委会遵照毛主席的教导，分别到各班去，广泛听取群众的意见。大多数群众认为：开展革命大批判是毛主席的伟大战略部署，是贯穿无产阶级文化大革命运动始终的根本任务，任何时候也不能放松。学校当前的清理阶级队伍的斗争，必须和革命的大批判结合起来，才能进一步提高广大群众的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争的觉悟，把一小撮坏人通通揪出来。通过和群众的广泛接触，革委会的同志深有感触地说：只要到群众中去，虚心向群众求教，一切问题都可以迎刃而解。
    事实一次又一次地教育了我们：我们的革委会，只有一刻也不脱离群众，把党的优良传统作风真正变成革委会的作风，才能把革委会建设成为一个革命化的，密切联系群众的，有无产阶级革命权威的领导机构。
