The revolutionary committee of the state-owned Hanhu Farm, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, correctly handled the cadres, enabling more than 90% of them to truly liberate themselves from their thoughts and actively engage in the frontlines of revolution and production. The revolutionary masses say: It's okay if cadres make mistakes, as long as they draw a clear line with the capitalist roaders and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to continue the revolution, we still trust them!

The following is a report from the People's Daily:

The revolutionary committee of Hanhu Farm in Hebei Province, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, has followed Chairman Mao's latest directive to "believe that more than 90% of the cadres are good or relatively good." They have started from ideological education, quickly raising the class struggle and two-line struggle awareness of cadres who have made mistakes, and gaining the trust of the masses in the struggle. So far, more than 92% of the cadres in the entire farm have been liberated. These cadres, with a new spirit and abundant revolutionary enthusiasm, are actively engaged in the frontlines of revolution and production.

Correcting the attitude towards the masses and actively standing up for the revolution

Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, some leading cadres of the state-owned Hanhu Farm implemented the revisionist line of building the farm advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents within the farm. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they again carried out the capitalist reactionary line, committing errors to varying degrees. Some of them, although they had made multiple self-criticisms, failed to pass the test because their fundamental attitude towards the masses had not changed. Thus, they mistakenly believed that the masses did not trust them, and further self-criticisms were futile. They passively waited for the organizational conclusions in the later stages of the movement instead of actively participating in the mass struggle.

The members of the revolutionary committee and the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team seriously analyzed these active thoughts among the cadres. They believed that the main reason why some cadres who made mistakes were not liberated was that the cadres could not correctly handle their relationship with the masses. Only by correcting their attitude towards the masses, actively going among the masses, and touching their souls, could they gain the understanding and trust of the masses. They organized more than 30 sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes combining leading cadres, revolutionary masses, and the People's Liberation Army. In these classes, they organized cadres to bring their problems, closely link them with the actual class struggle of the farm, and repeatedly study Chairman Mao's series of latest directives. At the same time, they started from class education, guiding cadres who made mistakes to recall the bitterness of the old society and compare it with the sweetness of the new society, talking about Chairman Mao's great wisdom; recalling the bitterness of the capitalist reactionary line and comparing it with the sweetness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, talking about the painful lessons of joining the wrong side; recalling the party's cultivation of themselves and comparing it with their attitude towards the revolutionary cause, talking about their future resolve. Through study and comparison, everyone's horizons broadened, their minds became clear, and they had a further understanding of the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Liberating cadres is mainly about liberating their minds and enhancing their awareness of the struggle between the two lines. The revolutionary committee and the propaganda team seized the opportunity to help cadres, according to Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, go among the masses to listen to opinions and examine their thoughts.

The former manager of the Fifth Brigade, Liu Congqi, had implemented the capitalist reactionary line and could not face his mistakes. After raising his awareness, he packed his bags and actively went among the masses. Wherever he went, he worked and studied with the masses, fully utilizing various opportunities to examine his mistakes to the masses and criticize the black goods of revisionism. Where the masses had the most opinions about him, he actively went there to make soul-searching examinations, quickly gaining the understanding of the masses.

Under the guidance and help of the revolutionary committee and the propaganda team, the cadres threw themselves into the great waves of mass struggle, getting dirty and calloused, absorbing nutrition from the masses, and getting rid of the "lord" style. They appeared among the masses with the attitude of a student, closely connecting with the masses. The revolutionary masses excitedly said: "Such cadres who can go up and down and correct their mistakes are trustworthy." In this way, a large number of cadres were quickly liberated.

Sending cadres to the battlefield of revolutionary criticism

Another important reason why some leading cadres who made mistakes were not liberated in time was that they could not quickly draw a clear line with the capitalist roaders within the farm. When the masses were enthusiastically carrying out revolutionary criticism, some cadres mistakenly thought that the revisionist line pushed by the capitalist roaders had a share in their own actions. Participating in exposure and criticism might "bring fire upon oneself" and "get involved." Therefore, when facing the capitalist roaders, some cadres showed a weak backbone, and some even "slipped away."

The revolutionary committee believed that to make cadres who made mistakes thoroughly draw a clear line with the capitalist reactionary line, they must be sent to the battlefield of revolutionary criticism. Make them deepen their understanding of their mistakes in the criticism, draw a clear line with the capitalist roaders, and draw a clear line with the capitalist reactionary line. At the same time, the masses can also further examine and identify the cadres in the criticism. In July and August of last year, during the high tide of criticism throughout the farm, they organized cadres who made mistakes to spend more than 20 days, taking the party's capitalist roaders within the farm as the target, criticizing and eliminating the revisionist poison they spread. To make the cadres' performance in the revolutionary criticism known to the masses in time, the revolutionary committee and the propaganda team also printed and distributed the problems exposed by the cadres in various criticism meetings and the criticism situation in the form of a brief report to the grassroots.

Cadres who made mistakes knew the most about the crimes of the capitalist roaders in their units. Once they raised their awareness, they could expose the sore spots of the capitalist roaders and hit the vital points. The former secretary of the party branch of the supply and marketing cooperative, Zhang Changle, had followed the capitalist roaders in Mazhuang to implement the revisionist black goods of "work points in command" and "material incentives" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. This time, he and his original team returned to the original place and carried out revolutionary criticism with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Zhang Changle realized through participating in the practice of revolutionary criticism that he had previously followed the capitalist roaders to walk the black path because he had not studied Chairman Mao's works well and his eyes were not bright. He deepened his understanding of his mistakes through face-to-face struggles with the capitalist roaders, feeling that his previous self-criticisms were not deep enough. He actively went among the masses and made a profound self-criticism, gaining the trust of the masses with practical actions. Soon, he was elected as a standing committee member of the brigade revolutionary committee. Revolutionary masses reflected: "It's okay if cadres make mistakes, as long as they draw a clear line with the capitalist roaders and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to continue the revolution, we still trust them!"

Sending cadres to the frontline of class struggle

The revolutionary committee and the propaganda team, in order to quickly liberate the cadres and shoulder the responsibility of promoting revolution and production, consciously arranged for them to participate in the practice of class struggle. However, some cadres thought that they had made mistakes in the past, and now the class struggle was so sharp and complex, and they might make new mistakes. After discovering this active thought among the cadres, the revolutionary committee and the propaganda team seriously studied Chairman Mao's series of instructions on cadre issues. Chairman Mao said: "Cadres should be examined and identified in long-term mass struggles, and successors should be selected and cultivated." They firmly believed that letting cadres be tempered and tested in the great storms of mass struggles was an effective method to fundamentally enhance their awareness of the struggle between the two lines and an important way to quickly liberate cadres. Therefore, they used Chairman Mao's thoughts to educate and arm the cadres. The revolutionary committee then adopted methods such as assisting work, demotion to labor, and participating in the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team to send cadres to the frontline of class struggle to fight side by side with the masses.

In February of this year, Hanhu Farm organized a Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team combining revolutionary mass representatives, revolutionary leading cadres, and the People's Liberation Army to go to the grassroots, mobilizing the masses to launch an attack on the class enemies. The leading cadres who had not yet been liberated at the total farm and brigade levels participated in the "three-in-one" propaganda team. They saw the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary mass representatives and the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, who were closely connected with the masses and highlighted proletarian politics, and were deeply educated and inspired.

On the frontline of class struggle, hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries were exposed. The shocking reality of class struggle deeply educated the leading cadres who made mistakes. They generally realized that the most important reason they made mistakes in the past was that they did not grasp class struggle, did not highlight proletarian politics, and did not mobilize and rely on the masses; they unconsciously led the masses to the capitalist black path by following the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. The more they thought about it, the more they felt that this lesson on class struggle was well learned. The former deputy manager of the Sixth Brigade, Zhang Lihuan, fought on the frontline of class struggle for three months and had deep feelings. The places he went to were exactly the places where he had previously stayed. But in the past, he only thought about production in his heart, asked about production with his mouth, and recorded production in his small notebook, ignoring the sharp and complex class struggle. This time, at the grassroots level, he saw those shocking facts of class struggle, which shocked him greatly. The high production enthusiasm of the revolutionary masses in the struggle deeply educated him.

Participating in the practice of class struggle, the leading cadres who made mistakes quickly fundamentally enhanced their awareness of the struggle between the two lines, determined to firmly stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, always believe in the masses, rely on the masses, respect the masses' pioneering spirit, and carry out the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

    大办毛泽东思想学习班提高干部两条路线斗争觉悟
    让干部到群众斗争中去经受锻炼迅速地站出来革命
    国营汉沽农场革委会在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，正确地对待干部，使百分之九十以上的干部真正从思想上解放出来，活跃在抓革命促生产的岗位上。革命群众说：干部犯了错误不要紧，只要和走资派划清了界限，回到毛主席革命路线上来继续革命，我们还是信得过！
    本报讯　河北省汉沽农场革命委员会，在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，遵照毛主席关于“要相信百分之九十以上的干部是好的和比较好的”的最新指示，从思想教育入手，使犯错误的干部很快提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，并在斗争实践中取得了群众的信任。到目前为止，全场已经有百分之九十二以上的干部解放出来。这些干部正以崭新的精神面貌和充沛的革命干劲，活跃在抓革命促生产的岗位上。
  端正对待群众的态度，积极站出来革命
    在无产阶级文化大革命前，国营汉沽农场的部分领导干部，在场内推行过中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的修正主义建场路线；在无产阶级文化大革命中，又执行了资产阶级反动路线，犯了不同程度的错误。他们当中有些人虽然做过多次检查，由于对群众的根本态度没有转变过来，总过不了“关”，于是便错误地认为：群众信不过，再检查也是白搭。他们消极地等待运动后期作组织结论，不是积极地投身到群众斗争中去。
    革委会成员和毛泽东思想宣传队，对干部中的这些活思想，进行了认真的分析。他们认为：有些犯错误的干部迟迟不能解放，主要在于干部不能正确对待群众。只有干部端正对群众的态度，主动深入群众，触及自己的灵魂，才能得到群众的谅解和信任。他们先后举办了三十多期有领导干部、革命群众和解放军“三结合”的毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，组织干部带着自己的问题，紧密联系本场阶级斗争的实际，反复学习毛主席的一系列最新指示。同时从阶级教育入手，引导犯错误的干部忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜，谈毛主席的英明伟大；忆资产阶级反动路线的苦，比毛主席革命路线的甜，谈站错队的沉痛教训；忆党对自己的培养，比自己对革命事业的态度，谈今后的决心。经过学习和回忆对比，大家眼界开阔，心里亮堂，对无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义有了进一步的理解。
    解放干部重要的是解放思想，使干部提高两条路线斗争觉悟。革委会和宣传队趁热打铁，帮助干部遵照毛主席的有关教导，到群众中去听取意见，检查思想。
    原五分场场长刘从起，执行过资产阶级反动路线，原来不能正视自己的错误。提高认识以后，他背起行李，主动到群众中去。走到那里，就跟群众一块劳动，一块在学习班里斗私批修，充分利用各种机会向群众检查自己的错误，批判修正主义的黑货。那里群众对他意见最多，他就主动到那里去作触及灵魂的检查，很快取得了群众的谅解。
    广大干部在革委会和宣传队启发帮助下，投身到群众斗争的大风浪里，滚一身泥巴，磨两手茧，从群众中吸取了营养，打掉了“老爷”作风，以小学生的姿态出现在群众当中，密切了干群关系。广大革命群众激动地说：“象这样能上能下，知错改错的好干部，我们一百个放心。”这样，很快解放了一大批干部。
    让广大干部走上革命大批判的战场
    农场有些犯错误的领导干部迟迟解放不出来的另一个重要原因，就是因为他们与场内走资派不能很快划清界限。在广大群众轰轰烈烈地开展革命大批判的时候，有的干部错误地认为：走资派推行的修正主义路线，自己或多或少有一份，参加揭发批判，弄不好会“引火烧身”，会“沾包”。因此，在和走资派进行面对面的斗争时，有的干部表现腰杆不硬，有的干脆“溜边”。
    革委会认为：要想让犯错误的干部彻底与资产阶级反动路线划清界限，就必须让他们走上革命大批判的战场。使他们在大批判中加深对自己错误的认识，与走资派划清界限，与资产阶级反动路线划清界限。同时群众也可以在大批判中进一步考查干部，识别干部。去年七、八月份，在全场大批判的高潮中，他们组织犯错误的干部，用了二十多天的时间，以本场党内走资派为对象，批判和肃清他们散布的修正主义流毒。为了把干部在革命大批判中的表现及时地让群众了解，革委会和宣传队还把干部在各种批判会上揭发的问题和批判的情况，以简报形式，印发到基层。
    犯错误的领导干部对本单位走资派的罪行最知底细，他们一旦提高认识以后，能揭到走资派的痛处，能打中走资派的要害。原供销社党支部书记张长乐，曾跟随场内走资派在马庄“蹲点”，推行中国赫鲁晓夫“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”的修正主义黑货。这次，他和原班人马，回到原地，和贫下中农一起进行革命大批判。张长乐从参加革命大批判的实践中认识到，以前所以跟着走资派跑黑道，都是因为毛主席著作学得不好，眼睛不亮。他通过与走资派面对面的斗争，对自己的错误加深了认识，感到以前的检查太不深刻了。他主动深入群众，作了深刻的检查，以实际行动取得了群众的信任，不久就被选为分场革命委员会的常委。革命群众反映说：“干部犯了错误不要紧，只要和走资派划清了界限，回到毛主席革命路线上来继续革命，我们还是信得过！”
        让干部到对敌斗争第一线去
    革委会和宣传队为了尽快地把干部解放出来，担负起抓革命促生产的重任，有意识地让他们参加对敌斗争的实践。可是有的干部认为：自己过去犯了错误，现在阶级斗争这么尖锐复杂，弄不好再犯新的错误。革委会和宣传队发现了干部的这一活思想以后，认真地学习了毛主席关于干部问题的一系列教导。毛主席说：“应当在长期的群众斗争中，考察和识别干部，挑选和培养接班人。”他们坚信让干部到群众斗争的大风雨中锻炼和考验，是从根本上提高他们的两条路线斗争觉悟的有效方法，是使干部尽快解放出来的重要途径。于是，他们便用毛主席的这一思想教育干部，武装干部。革委会接着采取了帮助工作、下放劳动、参加毛泽东思想宣传队等方式，让干部到阶级斗争第一线，同群众并肩战斗。
    今年二月，汉沽农场组成有革命群众代表、革命领导干部和解放军“三结合”的毛泽东思想宣传队，到基层去，发动群众向阶级敌人展开进攻。总场和分场级尚未解放的领导干部参加“三结合”的宣传队以后，看到革命群众代表和解放军同志革命斗志旺盛、密切联系群众、突出无产阶级政治的好思想、好作风、好方法，深受教育和启发。
    在阶级斗争第一线，暗藏的叛徒、特务和反革命分子被揭露出来。触目惊心的阶级斗争现实，使犯错误的领导干部受到了深刻的教育。他们普遍认识到：自己过去所以犯了错误，最重要的一条原因，就是不抓阶级斗争，不突出无产阶级政治，不发动和依靠群众；自己跟着中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人往黑道上走，还不自觉地把广大群众往资本主义黑道上领。他们越想越感到阶级斗争这一课上得好。原六分场副场长张立贤，在阶级斗争第一线战斗三个月，体会很深。他所去的地方，有的正是自己过去蹲过点的地方，但过去他心里想的是生产，口里问的是生产，小本本上记的还是生产，对尖锐复杂的阶级斗争不闻不问。这次他在基层看到那些触目惊心的阶级斗争的事实，震动很大。革命群众在斗争中焕发出的高度生产热情，深深地教育了他。
    参加阶级斗争的实践，犯错误的领导干部很快从根本上提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，决心坚定地站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，永远相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，把史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
