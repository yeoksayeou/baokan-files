The construction army of Shanghai Site 1450, holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism guided by Mao Zedong Thought, conducted thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism throughout the construction process. This significantly promoted the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought, maintaining a vibrant revolutionary atmosphere on the construction site. This construction army, with its high speed and quality, completed the construction tasks ahead of schedule and became a red flag in Shanghai's construction industry for "grasp revolution, promote production."

This project, which previously required at least two years to complete, was finished in just eight and a half months during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The construction quality exceeded the design requirements, and the cost was significantly reduced, achieving the goals of more, faster, better, and cheaper. Particularly during the construction process, the awareness of class struggle and the two-line struggle continuously improved, and the self-awareness of ideological revolutionization continuously strengthened. These achievements fully demonstrated the glorious results of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the tremendous power of revolutionary criticism.

Severely criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's heinous crimes against Mao Zedong Thought, turning the construction site into a grand school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought

Vice Chairman Lin instructed us: "We must use Mao Zedong Thought to unify the thoughts of the entire Party and the thoughts of the people of the whole country."

This construction army is composed of construction workers from eight construction companies in Shanghai and poor and lower-middle peasants from five communes in the suburbs, led by the Party Committee of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. During the leadership of this temporary collective in construction, the Party Committee first organized the construction army to severely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's heinous crimes of opposing Mao Zedong Thought and suppressing the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Through revolutionary criticism, the construction site was turned into a grand school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Many construction workers, combining their personal experiences, said at the criticism meetings: During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we studied the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on "breaking superstitions and liberating thoughts," and everyone was spirited and full of fighting spirit. The construction sites were filled with a revolutionary atmosphere. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents were terrified and hated the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and forcibly suppressed the vigorous movement. Through revolutionary criticism, everyone deeply realized that Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of the revolutionary people, and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers directly grasping Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for our great socialist motherland to never change color, thereby greatly enhancing the self-awareness of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

As soon as the construction army entered the site, the first system they established was "Daily Reading." The entire site reads Chairman Mao's quotations before work every day to receive Chairman Mao's instructions; during construction, they read Chairman Mao's quotations and follow Chairman Mao's commands; after work, they read Chairman Mao's quotations and report to Chairman Mao sincerely. When making plans, they use Chairman Mao's instructions to boost morale; during team evaluations, they use Chairman Mao's instructions to summarize experiences. Many old workers who cannot read much pair up with others, asking them to read while they memorize one sentence at a time, memorizing one section after another of Chairman Mao's instructions. Some old workers who live far away insist on coming to the site every morning to study the "Three Articles" with the PLA. With the help of the PLA, the entire site established regular study and application sessions of Chairman Mao's works and monthly rectification sessions, and held 36 sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with all construction personnel attending at least one session.

During the revolutionary criticism, the entire site became a grand classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The PLA comrades and construction personnel, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies, examined how the great leader Chairman Mao taught, how the Chinese Khrushchev poisoned, and how the class enemies in their units acted. Each criticism meeting was a powerful indictment of the Chinese Khrushchev's heinous crimes and a passionate song of praise for the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought.

During the revolutionary criticism, Mao Zedong Thought was firmly established, and the entire site had a clear political direction. Many construction workers proudly said that this way of construction was different from the past in six ways: the atmosphere was different, entering the construction site was like entering a political classroom, receiving Mao Zedong Thought education at every moment; the feelings were different, fighting with sincere loyalty to Chairman Mao, full of energy and strength; the thoughts were different, thinking about national affairs, class affairs, and world revolution; the actions were different, everyone studied, memorized, lectured, applied, and sang Chairman Mao's quotations, using Chairman Mao's instructions to guide everything; the relationships between people were different, workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary technical personnel were closely united, caring for, loving, and helping each other politically, and moving forward together; the results were different, the human factor was fully utilized, and the construction tasks were completed with more, faster, better, and cheaper results.

Severely criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist line, firmly establishing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line

Throughout the construction period, the Party Committee organized the construction army to severely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line and firmly establish Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Everyone verbally and in writing condemned and thoroughly criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist fallacies such as "technology first," "profit-oriented," and "expert management," breaking away from various foreign dogmas and frameworks that hinder the development of productive forces. During construction, they insisted on Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, emphasized proletarian politics, established the spirit of daring to think, daring to do, and bold innovation, carried out mass movements, followed the mass line, fully developed technical democracy, continuously carried out technical innovations and technical revolutions, and achieved great results.

The construction plan for this project was jointly formulated by workers, leading cadres, and technical personnel every month and decided after collective discussion by the masses. The participating masses often proposed modifications to the unreasonable parts of the designs made by technical personnel based on the actual situation on the site. Various trades often held "pre-battle mobilizations" and "post-battle evaluations," examining what happened against Chairman Mao's instructions. When encountering technical difficulties in specific construction, they held "Zhuge Liang meetings" on the site to mobilize the masses to contribute ideas and strategies. As soon as the construction of the project began, a great debate on the water-cement ratio of concrete was launched on the site. This great debate was initiated by the workers who operated the equipment, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "starting from the objective and true situation, not from subjective wishes," and was directed against the wrong practices of some technical personnel who did not believe in the masses and did not consider the actual situation. The Party Committee firmly supported this great debate and maintained and carried forward this technical democratic atmosphere throughout the construction process. This allowed the wisdom of the broad masses to be fully utilized, greatly improving the quality of the project and accelerating the construction progress.

During the construction process, they also broke away from the old relationships and regulations that restricted each other with foreign frameworks and rigid systems between the construction site and the cooperative units for material supply, transportation, measurement, etc., establishing new relationships and regulations that shone with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. The project needed to be completed in a short period with guaranteed quality and quantity, so a large amount of materials had to be prepared. The procurement personnel sent by the construction site did not simply purchase and expedite goods but carried Mao Zedong Thought wherever they went, vigorously publicizing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," actively participating in production labor, and promoting the relevant units to ensure the supply of materials needed by the site.

Severely criticizing the reactionary bourgeois worldview, achieving ideological revolutionization in the great waves of class struggle

The Party Committee leading this construction army also firmly grasped the "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" guideline, organizing the construction army to severely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's extremely decadent bourgeois worldviews such as "public-private integration" and "suffering small losses for big gains," tempering their loyalty to Chairman Mao in the great waves of class struggle. Throughout the construction process, the entire site organized large, medium, and small types of criticism meetings and used various forms such as criticism columns, blackboard newspapers, site battle reports, and site broadcasts to severely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's black "self-cultivation."

Some comrades on the site were once deceived by the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie and stood on the wrong side at the beginning of the movement. But most of them came from working-class families, and each family had a history of suffering in the old society. During the revolutionary criticism, they organized multiple bitter-sweet remembrance meetings and denunciation meetings, severely criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's shameless fallacies such as "exploitation is meritorious," arousing these comrades' deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, strengthening their profound proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao, and enhancing their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

During the revolutionary criticism, many comrades, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to constantly eliminate bourgeois ideology and establish proletarian ideology in their minds. Some workers participating in the project construction were once influenced by the counter-revolutionary economism and anarchism trends in society. They severely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, enhanced their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and consciously used Mao Zedong Thought to fight against all phenomena that disrupt labor discipline and democratic centralism, striving to be models of "grasp revolution, promote production." Some young people from the countryside, after struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, consciously took the PLA as an example, learned the three-eight spirit of the PLA, and ensured that they studied Chairman Mao's quotations before work, after work, before meals, before meetings, and before receiving tasks, carrying the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations wherever they went, inspiring fighting spirit and boosting morale, becoming a shock troop on the site.

Revolutionary criticism greatly enhanced people's self-awareness of achieving ideological revolutionization. The construction personnel followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment step by step, ensuring the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions. After the project was completed, the workers and poor peasants who had left the site still insisted on the "five unchanges": continuing to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, maintaining the system of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works unchanged; enthusiastically publicizing Mao Zedong Thought unchanged; firmly criticizing the bourgeoisie unchanged; actively engaging in self-criticism, conducting heart-to-heart talks, and strengthening political and ideological work unchanged; maintaining military-civilian unity, caring for and helping each other politically unchanged.

    上海一四五○建筑工地建设大军狠批中国赫鲁晓夫
    革命大批判促进毛泽东思想大普及
    又多又快又好又省地完成施工任务
    据新华社上海二十六日电　上海一四五○建筑工地的建设大军，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，在整个施工过程中，深入持久地开展革命大批判，有力地促进了毛泽东思想的大普及，使建筑工地始终呈现一派热气腾腾的革命景象。这支建设大军以高速度、高质量提前完成了施工任务，成为上海市建筑工业系统“抓革命，促生产”的一面红旗。
    这一项过去至少需要两年才能完工的工程，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中只用了八个半月，就胜利地完成了全部施工任务。工程质量超过了设计要求，造价也大大降低，做到了多快好省。特别是在施工过程中，人们的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟不断提高，实现思想革命化的自觉性不断增强。这些成就，充分显示出无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌战果，显示出革命大批判的巨大威力。
    狠批中国赫鲁晓夫反对毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，把建筑工地办成活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校
    林副主席指示我们：“我们要用毛泽东思想统一全党的思想，统一全国人民群众的思想。”
    这支建设大军是由来自上海市八个建筑公司的建筑工人和市郊五个人民公社的贫下中农组成的，由人民解放军某部党委领导。部队党委在领导这样一个临时集体进行施工中，首先组织建设大军狠批中国赫鲁晓夫反对毛泽东思想，扼杀活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的滔天罪行。通过革命大批判，把施工现场办成活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校。许多建筑工人结合自己的切身体会，在批判大会上说：一九五八年大跃进的年代，我们大学伟大领袖毛主席关于“破除迷信，解放思想”的教导，人人精神振奋，斗志昂扬，建筑工地到处呈现出热气腾腾的革命景象。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人对广大革命群众活学活用毛泽东思想，怕得要死，恨得要命，硬是把轰轰烈烈的活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动压下去。经过革命大批判，大家深刻地认识到：毛泽东思想是革命人民的命根子，广大工农兵直接掌握毛泽东思想，是使我们伟大的社会主义祖国永不变色的根本保证，因而大大提高了活学活用毛泽东思想的自觉性。
    建设大军一进入工地，建立的第一个制度就是
  “天天读”。全工地每天上班前学毛主席语录，接受毛主席指示；施工中学毛主席语录，听从毛主席的指挥；下班后学毛主席语录，认真向毛主席汇报。制订计划时用毛主席指示鼓舞干劲，班组讲评时用毛主席指示总结经验。许多老工人识字不多，就和别人结成
  “一对红”，请别人念，自己一字一句地记，背下了一段又一段毛主席的指示。有的老工人家住得远，每天早上坚持到工地和解放军一起学习“老三篇”。在解放军的帮助下，全工地建立了定期的活学活用毛主席著作讲用会和每月整风等制度，还举办了三十六期毛泽东思想学习班，全体施工人员普遍在学习班学习了一次。
    在革命大批判中，整个工地成了活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂。部队同志和施工人员一起以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义谬论，看伟大领袖毛主席是怎样教导的，中国赫鲁晓夫是怎样放毒的，本单位的阶级敌人是怎样干的。每一次批判会都是对中国赫鲁晓夫滔天罪行的有力控诉，都是对伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想的热情颂歌。
    在革命大批判中大立了毛泽东思想，整个工地就有了明确的政治方向。许多建筑工人自豪地说，这样搞建设，和过去有六个“不一样”：气氛不一样，走进施工现场，就象进了政治课堂，时时刻刻能受到毛泽东思想的教育；感情不一样，以对毛主席的赤胆忠心投入战斗，浑身是劲力量大；想的不一样，脑子里想着国家的大事，阶级的大事，世界革命的大事；做的不一样，人人大学、大背、大讲、大用、大唱毛主席语录，用毛主席指示统帅一切；人与人之间的关系不一样，工农兵、革命干部和革命技术人员紧密团结，从政治上互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助，共同前进；效果不一样，人的因素充分发挥，施工任务完成得又多又快又好又省。
    狠批中国赫鲁晓夫推行的修正主义路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线
    整个施工期间，部队党委组织建设大军狠批中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。人人口诛笔伐，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“技术第一”、“利润挂帅”、“专家治厂”等等修正主义谬论，破除了阻碍生产力发展的各种洋教条、洋框框。在施工中坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，突出无产阶级政治，大立敢想、敢干、大胆创新的思想，大搞群众运动，走群众路线，充分发扬技术民主，不断进行技术革新和技术革命，取得了巨大成果。
    这个工程的施工计划，每个月都由工人、领导干部、技术人员“三结合”制订出来，并经过群众集体讨论以后决定。参加施工的群众还经常根据现场实际情况，对技术人员所作设计中的不合理部分提出修改建议。各工种经常进行“战前动员”、“战后讲评”，发生什么情况，就对照毛主席指示进行检查。具体施工中遇到技术难题，就在现场召开“诸葛亮会”，发动群众献计献策。工程施工刚开始，在工地就展开了一场关于混凝土水灰配比的大辩论。这场大辩论是由实际操作的工人，遵照毛主席“从客观的真实的情况出发，而不是从主观的愿望出发”的教导，针对个别技术人员不相信群众、不考虑实际情况的错误做法而展开的。部队党委坚决支持了这一场大辩论，并且在整个施工过程中一直保持和发扬了这种技术民主空气。这就使广大群众的聪明才智得到了比较充分的发挥，从而大大提高了工程质量，加快了施工进度。
    施工过程中，他们还大破过去建筑工地和原料材料供应、运输、测量等等协作单位之间互相以洋框框、死制度“卡人”的旧关系，建立了闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的新关系新规程。工程需要在短时期内保质保量地完成，就必须准备大量物资。建筑工地派出的采购人员，不是单纯地购货、催货，而是走到那里，就把毛泽东思想带到那里，大力宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，积极参加生产劳动，推动有关单位保证了工地所需的原料材料的供应。
    狠批反动的资产阶级世界观，在阶级斗争大风大浪中实现人的思想革命化
    领导这支建设大军的部队党委还紧紧抓住“斗私，批修”这个纲，组织建设大军狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“大公有私”、“公私溶合”论和“吃小亏占大便宜”等极端腐朽的资产阶级世界观，在阶级斗争大风浪中锤炼对毛主席的忠心。在整个施工过程中，全工地组织了大中小各种类型的批判会，并且采用出大批判专栏、黑板报、工地战报，以及办工地广播等多种形式，狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的黑《修养》。
    工地上有些同志一度受过资产阶级反动路线的蒙蔽，在运动初期站错过队。但他们大部分出身于劳动人民家庭，在旧社会家家有一部苦难史。在革命大批判中，他们组织了多次忆苦思甜会、控诉声讨会，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“剥削有功”等无耻谰言，激发了这些同志对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，增强了对毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    在革命大批判中，许多同志按照毛主席“要斗私，批修”的教导，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，不断地在头脑里灭资兴无，破私立公。参加工程建设的部分工人，一度受社会上反革命经济主义和无政府主义思潮的影响。他们狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义路线，提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，自觉地用毛泽东思想同一切破坏劳动纪律、破坏民主集中制的现象展开坚决的斗争，人人争做“抓革命，促生产”的模范。部分来自农村的青年，经过斗私批修，都自觉地以解放军为榜样，学习解放军的三八作风，做到每天上班前、下班前、吃饭前、开会前、接受任务前整队学习毛主席语录，走到哪里就把毛主席语录歌声带到哪里，激励斗志，鼓舞干劲，成为工地的一支突击队。
    革命大批判极大地提高了人们实现思想革命化的自觉性。参加施工的人员步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，保证了毛主席一系列最新指示的落实。在工程竣工以后，已经离开这个工地的工人和贫下中农，仍然坚持了“五个不变”：大办毛泽东思想学习班，坚持活学活用毛主席著作制度不变；热情宣传毛泽东思想不变；坚决批判资产阶级不变；多作自我批评，开展谈心活动，大力加强政治思想工作不变；军民团结，从政治上互相爱护、互相帮助不变。
