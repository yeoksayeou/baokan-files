The wave of black resistance in the United States has surged forward with successive outbreaks in Grand Rapids, Michigan; Gary, Indiana; and Cincinnati, Ohio. These events have left the ruling class in a state of panic. On the 26th and 28th, black youth in these cities bravely stood up against white racists, engaging in fierce battles with the police. The situation has the American reactionary ruling class in a state of alarm.

On the evening of the 26th, black youth in Grand Rapids, Michigan's second-largest city, courageously fought back against white racists. They stopped a car carrying a U.S. military officer and other white racists, dragging them out and giving them a beating. When a large number of police arrived to carry out mass arrests and brutal suppression, the blacks fought back with bricks, bottles, and other weapons. They set fire to several white racist-owned stores. On the 28th, Michigan Governor Romney hastily declared a state of emergency in Grand Rapids, imposing a curfew, banning the sale of firearms, gunpowder, and gasoline, and putting the National Guard on alert, ready to carry out bloody suppression at any moment.

On the 28th, over 500 black youth in Gary, Indiana, took to the streets, smashing white racist-owned stores along the main roads. The reactionary authorities sent in a large number of police to carry out brutal suppression. The blacks were undeterred, and some armed blacks even fired back from the rooftops. Gary is one of the important steel-producing cities in the United States, with a population of about 200,000, more than half of whom are black.

On the 28th, in Cincinnati, Ohio, two car accidents occurred. As more and more black onlookers gathered, the police, frightened by the black struggle, unreasonably suppressed the blacks. The blacks fought back, and some black snipers shot and injured several police officers.

Since the 23rd, black resistance has broken out in cities such as Cleveland, Boston, Detroit, Seattle, Erie, Grand Rapids, Gary, and Cincinnati. In particular, the Cleveland blacks' bravery in taking up arms and fighting back against the fascist police, leaving many dead and wounded, has left the American ruling class in a state of panic. Western news agencies recently admitted that the American ruling class is generally concerned that the black struggle will ultimately overthrow their evil rule, warning that these recent struggles "mark the beginning of a dangerous new situation in the black struggle for equality." A White House spokesman recently anxiously announced that U.S. imperialist leader Johnson is "closely watching the situation in Cleveland."

    大造白人种族主义者的反  把斗争浪潮推向前进
    美国又接连爆发黑人抗暴斗争
    黑人狙击手开枪反击警察镇压，打得统治集团惊惶不安
    新华社二十九日讯华盛顿消息：美国密执安州的大瀑布城、印第安纳州的格里市、俄亥俄州的辛辛那提市，在二十六日和二十八日又接连爆发了黑人抗暴斗争，使得从二十三日晚上克利夫兰市黑人掀起的美国黑人抗暴斗争的新浪潮迅速推向前进，这种情况吓得美国反动统治集团坐卧不安。
    二十六日晚上，密执安州的第二大城大瀑布城的许多黑人青年勇敢地大造白人种族主义者的反，他们拦住一个美军军官和一些其他白人种族主义者的汽车，把这些平时骄横跋扈的家伙，拖出车来痛打了一顿。当大批警察赶来进行疯狂的逮捕和残酷的镇压时，黑人们用砖头、瓶子等作武器同警察进行了激烈的搏斗，并放火把一些白人种族主义者的商店烧掉。二十八日，密执安州州长罗姆尼慌忙宣布大瀑布城处于紧急状态，下令实行宵禁，禁止出售枪支、火药和汽油，并要国民警卫队处于警戒状态，武装待命，随时准备进行血腥的镇压。
    二十八日，印第安纳州格里市的五百余名黑人青年又奋起斗争，他们在格里市中心把大马路两旁的许多白人种族主义者的商店砸得稀巴烂。反动当局派来大批警察，进行疯狂镇压。黑人们毫不畏惧，一些带枪的黑人还在屋顶上开枪回击。格里市是美国生产钢铁的重要城市之一，有人口约二十万，其中一半以上是黑人。
    二十八日，在俄亥俄州辛辛那提市有两辆汽车肇事，当旁观的黑人越聚越多时，被黑人斗争吓破了胆的警察竟无理镇压黑人，黑人们奋起反抗，一些黑人狙击手开枪打伤了好几名警察。
    自从二十三日以来，美国黑人的抗暴斗争，已接连在克利夫兰、波士顿、底特律、西雅图、伊利、大瀑布城、格里和辛辛那提等大城市爆发。其中特别是克利夫兰市黑人拿起武器把法西斯警察打得死伤累累的大无畏气概，使得美国统治阶级十分惊惶。西方通讯社最近承认，美国统治集团普遍担心黑人斗争将最后推翻他们的罪恶统治，惊呼最近的这些斗争“标志着黑人争取平等的斗争中一种危险的新情况的开始”。美国白宫发言人最近忧心忡忡地宣布，美帝国主义头子约翰逊“正密切注视着克利夫兰的局势”。
