On the occasion of celebrating the 25th anniversary of the heroic Albanian People's Army, we, with the feelings of comrades and fellow soldiers, extend our warm congratulations and combat salutes to the fraternal Albanian people and the Albanian People's Army!

Twenty-five years ago, when the evil iron hooves of the Italian Fascist bandits were still echoing along the Adriatic coast, the glorious Albanian People's Army was born. Under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Communist Party, the Albanian people and their heroic sons and daughters waged arduous and unyielding struggles against Italian and German Fascism. Ultimately, relying on their own strength, they defeated the Fascist bandits, liberated Albania, and for the first time in Albanian history, established a socialist state where the laboring people were the masters. The Albanian People's Army has walked a glorious path and has established immortal merits for the Albanian revolutionary cause.

The Albanian People's Army is a proletarian revolutionary army created and nurtured with Marxism-Leninism by the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha. It is a heroic army tempered in the fiery trials of the national liberation war and a powerful pillar of the Albanian proletarian dictatorship.

Today, all the officers and soldiers of the Albanian People's Army, under the correct leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, are holding their guns firmly and standing closely with the people, vigilantly defending the socialist motherland. In the great struggle of socialist revolution and socialist construction, they have always been at the forefront of the battle. In the magnificent revolutionary mass movement carried out by the Albanian people, the Albanian People's Army is advancing vigorously on the great road of proletarian revolutionization and militarization. The heroic Albanian People's Army is loyal to the Party, loyal to the people, loyal to the motherland, and loyal to the revolution, having a flesh-and-blood bond with the people. Such a proletarian revolutionary army is not only the pride of the Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people but also the pride of all Marxist-Leninist revolutionary parties and revolutionary peoples of the world.

Today, the Albanian people and the Albanian People's Army, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha, are holding high the revolutionary red flag of Marxism-Leninism, waging a sharp and complex struggle against the blockade, provocation, sabotage, and subversive activities of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys and running dogs, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, and the Tito renegade clique. They are bravely defending socialist Albania. We are firmly convinced that the struggle of the Albanian people will surely achieve new and great victories! And imperialism, modern revisionism, and all the accomplices and running dogs of imperialism, if they dare to make any rash moves against socialist Albania, will meet with a crushing defeat in front of the iron wall built by the Albanian people and the Albanian People's Army!

“'Though we are far apart, our hearts are close.' Though China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are connected." We are immensely proud to have the Albanian People's Army as our revolutionary comrades-in-arms. We deeply understand that the friendship between the two parties, the two peoples, and the two armies of China and Albania is created by our great leader Chairman Mao and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha. It is based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. Our friendship has been forged in the struggle against common enemies and has been tested by storms and tempests. It is the greatest and most precious friendship in the world.

The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in the current march to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are raising the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, bringing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, emphasizing proletarian politics, and thoroughly carrying out the thought revolutionization of people. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a revolutionary army that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This army, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has become more proletarian and more militarized. We, together with the heroic Albanian people and the Albanian People's Army, in the common struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, will forever stand together, fight together, and advance shoulder to shoulder to victory!

    英雄的军队　光荣的历史
    北京部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、五好战士　薛俊江
    在庆祝英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民军建军二十五周年的日子里，我们怀着同志和战友的感情，向兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民军致以热烈的祝贺和战斗的敬礼！
    二十五年以前，当亚得里亚海边还响着意大利法西斯强盗罪恶的铁蹄声的时候，阿尔巴尼亚人民军光荣诞生了。阿尔巴尼亚人民及其英雄的子弟兵，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的共产党的领导下，先后同意大利、德国法西斯进行了艰苦卓绝的斗争，终于依靠自己的力量，打败了法西斯强盗，解放了阿尔巴尼亚，并在阿尔巴尼亚的历史上第一次建立起了劳动人民当家作主的、社会主义的国家。阿尔巴尼亚人民军走过了光辉的道路，为阿尔巴尼亚的革命事业建立了不朽的功勋。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军，是阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志亲手缔造的、用马克思列宁主义哺育起来的一支无产阶级的革命军队，是一支经过民族解放战争的烈火千锤百炼的英雄军队，是阿尔巴尼亚无产阶级专政的强大支柱。
    今天，阿尔巴尼亚人民军的全体指战员，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的正确领导下，紧握手中枪，和人民群众紧密地站在一起，警惕地保卫着社会主义祖国。他们在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大斗争中，始终站在斗争的最前列。在阿尔巴尼亚人民开展的轰轰烈烈的革命化群众运动中，阿尔巴尼亚人民军正在无产阶级革命化、战斗化的大道上豪迈地前进。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民军忠于党、忠于人民、忠于祖国、忠于革命，同人民群众有着血肉般的联系。这样一支无产阶级革命化的军队，不仅是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民的骄傲，而且是全世界马克思列宁主义的革命党和革命人民的骄傲。
    今天，阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民军，正在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和恩维尔·霍查同志的领导下，高举马克思列宁主义的革命红旗，同美帝国主义及其奴仆和爪牙苏修领导集团和铁托叛徒集团的封锁、挑衅、破坏和颠覆活动，进行着尖锐复杂的斗争，英勇地捍卫着社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚。我们坚信，阿尔巴尼亚人民的斗争，必将不断地取得新的伟大的胜利！而帝国主义、现代修正主义，以及帝国主义的一切帮凶和走狗，胆敢对社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚轻举妄动，都将在阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民军所筑成的铜墙铁壁面前，碰得头破血流！
    “‘海内存知己，天涯若比邻’。中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。”我们为有阿尔巴尼亚人民军这样的革命战友而感到无比的自豪。我们深深懂得：中阿两党、两国人民和两国军队之间的友谊，是我们的伟大领袖毛主席和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志亲手缔造的，是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则基础上的。我们之间的友谊，是在反对共同敌人的斗争中形成的，是经过急风暴雨考验的革命的战斗友谊，是世界上最伟大、最珍贵的友谊。
    我们中国人民解放军的指战员，在当前夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利的进军中，正在更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个崭新的阶段，突出无产阶级政治，切实搞好人的思想革命化。中国人民解放军，是一支无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的革命军队。这支军队经过无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，变得更加无产阶级化，更加战斗化了。我们同英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民军，在反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义和反对各国反动派的共同斗争中，将永远团结在一起，战斗在一起，永远肩并肩地胜利前进！
