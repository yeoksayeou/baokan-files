The revolutionary and production situation on China's shipping lines is excellent. The broad masses of workers are vigorously promoting the revolution and vigorously advancing production, greatly developing the excellent situation. The volume of traffic on the coast and the Yangtze River is increasing month by month, and the throughput of major coastal ports is growing significantly. The time ships spend in port is continuously decreasing.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated July 3, the broad revolutionary masses fighting on China's coastal, inland river ports, and various shipping lines have turned the warm concern of the great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin into a tremendous force, launching a new high tide of seizing the revolution and promoting production. Many units are carrying out the revolution with great fanfare, and transport production is booming. The revolutionary and production situation on the shipping lines is excellent and getting better and better.

Since the national railway and transportation conference in May, the broad revolutionary masses on China's shipping lines have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, vigorously seized the revolution, and vigorously promoted production, greatly developing the excellent situation. In just over a month, more than 30 units have established revolutionary committees with three-in-one combination. The volume of traffic on the coast and the Yangtze River has been increasing month by month, with a growth of more than 10% in May compared to April, and a further increase of 7.5% in June compared to May. Based on the significant growth in May, the throughput of major coastal ports increased by 8% in June, completing the June plan ahead of schedule and exceeding it. The Shanghai Maritime Bureau, Guangzhou Maritime Bureau, Shanghai Port, Qingdao Port, Dalian Port, Qinhuangdao Port, Tianjin Port, Yingkou Port, Zhanjiang Port, and Beihai Port have all completed their June transport production plans ahead of schedule. The time ships spend in port is continuously decreasing. Tianjin Port, Yantai Port, Dalian Port Oil Area, and Shanghai Port's Second Loading and Unloading Area have all created the highest throughput levels in their respective ports' histories. On every transport line across the country's inland rivers and vast oceans, the triumphant songs of the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought are resounding.

"The class struggle, once grasped, is effective." The practice of seizing the revolution and promoting production by the broad revolutionary masses on the shipping lines once again proves that Chairman Mao's instruction is a great truth. The broad revolutionary masses have seriously studied the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat under the conditions of socialism to overthrow the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." They have further clarified the new situation, new characteristics, and new trends of the current class struggle in their regions and units. The broad revolutionary masses on the shipping lines have resolutely smashed the rightist reversal wind. They have followed Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions, united all revolutionary forces that can be united, and accurately and forcefully struck down a handful of class enemies. Each unit has exposed a batch of traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries hidden within the revolutionary ranks.

Currently, the mass revolutionary criticism is developing with the momentum of an irresistible force. Class enemies have become the rats that everyone wants to beat. The revolutionary criticism in Tianjin Port, Shanghai Port, Dalian Port, Wuhu Port, the Shanghai Branch of the Yangtze River Shipping Company, and the Wuhan Branch are all carried out with great fanfare. Revolutionary sailors have put forward the battle slogans, "Workers wield pens to create waves, sailors vow to be critics," "Not only should we wield hammers, but also pens." Everyone is participating in the battle, verbally and in writing. Many units have formed a vast revolutionary criticism army, organized by work teams, and carried out revolutionary criticism. They have fiercely criticized the "class struggle extinction" theory and the "material incentives," "production first" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist goods advocated by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the transportation system and their units, greatly raising the broad revolutionary masses' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

Due to the in-depth development of revolutionary criticism and the exposure of class enemies hidden within the revolutionary ranks who attempted to sabotage the revolution and production, the broad revolutionary masses' morale has been greatly boosted, powerfully promoting the development of transport production. After the revolutionary workers of the Qinhuangdao Port Transport Team exposed the class enemies who attempted to sabotage the revolution and production, their class struggle awareness was greatly enhanced, revolutionary enthusiasm doubled, the number of locomotive departures increased by onefold compared to before, and the number of trains received increased by 50%.

The revolutionary committees at various levels of the shipping system, born in the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are determined to follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, build the newly born revolutionary committees into revolutionary leadership teams that are connected with the masses. Many units' revolutionary committees, except for a few people on duty, have mostly gone to the ships and docks, studying, working, and fighting with the revolutionary workers, leading the revolutionary workers to carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism and launch a fierce attack on class enemies. In the struggle to seize the revolution and promote production, the revolutionary committees have mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of the revolutionary masses, and promoted the continuous development of the revolution and production.

    我国航运战线革命和生产形势大好
    广大职工狠抓革命，猛促生产，大大发展了大好形势。沿海和长江的运量逐月上升，沿海主要港口的吞吐量大幅度增长，船舶停港时间不断缩短
    据新华社三日讯　战斗在我国沿海、内河港口和各条航运线上的广大革命职工，把伟大领袖毛主席为首、林彪副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀，化为巨大的力量，掀起了抓革命、促生产的新高潮。许多单位革命搞得轰轰烈烈，运输生产热气腾腾，航运战线的革命和生产形势一片大好，越来越好。
    自五月份全国铁路、交通会议以后，我国航运战线上的广大革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓革命，猛促生产，大大发展了大好形势。在短短一个多月里，又有三十多个单位建立了三结合的革命委员会。沿海和长江的运量逐月上升，五月比四月增长百分之十以上，六月又比五月上升百分之七点五。沿海主要港口的吞吐量在五月份有较大幅度增长的基础上又上升百分之八，提前超额完成了六月份的计划。上海海运局、广州海运局、上海港、青岛港、大连港、秦皇岛港、天津港、营口港、湛江港、北海港等单位都提前完成了六月份运输生产计划。船舶停港时间不断缩短。天津港、烟台港、大连港油区、上海港第二装卸区都创造了本港历史上吞吐量的最高水平。遍及全国内河和辽阔海洋的条条运输线上，到处响彻着毛泽东思想伟大胜利的凯歌。
      “阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”航运战线上的广大革命职工抓革命、促生产的实践，再次表明了毛主席这一指示是千真万确的伟大真理。广大革命职工认真地学习了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”他们对照本地区、本单位的阶级斗争实际，进一步认清了当前阶级斗争的新形势、新特点、新动向。航运战线广大革命职工坚决粉碎右倾翻案妖风。他们遵照毛主席关于正确区分两类不同性质矛盾的教导，团结一切可以团结的革命力量，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。各单位挖出了一批隐藏在革命队伍里的叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子。
    目前，群众性的革命大批判正以排山倒海之势向前发展。阶级敌人成了人人喊打的过街老鼠。天津港、上海港、大连港、芜湖港、长江航运公司上海分公司和武汉分公司等单位的革命大批判，都搞得轰轰烈烈。革命海员们提出了“工人挥笔卷巨浪，海员誓当批判家”，“不但要拿起锤把子，也要拿起笔杆子”的战斗口号，人人参战，口诛笔伐。许多单位组成浩浩荡荡的革命批判大军，以班组为单位，开展革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在交通系统和本单位代理人鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论以及“物质刺激”、“生产第一”等反革命修正主义黑货，大大提高了广大革命职工阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    由于革命大批判的深入开展和在清理阶级队伍中挖出了妄图破坏革命、破坏生产的暗藏的阶级敌人，大长了广大革命职工的志气，有力地推动了运输生产的发展。秦皇岛港运输大队革命职工揪出了妄图破坏革命和生产的阶级敌人以后，阶级斗争觉悟大大提高，革命干劲倍增，机车出车台数比以前增加一倍，接送的列车增加百分之五十。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的暴风雨中诞生的航运系统各级革命委员会，决心遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，把新生的革委会建设成为革命化的联系群众的领导班子。许多单位革委会除留少数人值班外，大多数成员都深入到船上、码头，和革命职工同学习、同劳动、同战斗，带领革命职工深入开展革命大批判，向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻。革委会在抓革命、促生产的斗争中，发动群众，依靠群众，大大调动了革命群众的积极性，促进了革命和生产的不断发展。
