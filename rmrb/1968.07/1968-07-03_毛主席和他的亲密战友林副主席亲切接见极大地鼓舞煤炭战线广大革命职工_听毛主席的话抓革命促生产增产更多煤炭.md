In the midst of the nation's celebration of the 47th anniversary of the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party, our great teacher, great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade Vice Chairman Lin Biao once again received the revolutionary worker representatives attending the national coal industry conference on seizing the revolution and promoting production. This greatly inspired the revolutionary workers of the national coal industry. They expressed their determination to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great line of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," to thoroughly carry out Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, to grasp class struggle, to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, to consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, to do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation within their units, and to achieve greater victories in both revolution and production.

From last night to today, coal mines across the country, from the surface to underground, from the mines to the factories, from the mining teams to the exploration teams, from the design departments to the construction sites, were all in a state of jubilation. The great news of Chairman Mao's reception inspired every revolutionary worker and their families. Many coal mines held celebrations late into the night. Miners working underground were all jubilant and full of vigor. They excitedly said, "Chairman Mao and his close comrade Vice Chairman Lin once again received our representatives. This is the greatest care, the greatest inspiration, the greatest trust, and the greatest encouragement for the workers of the national coal industry. With boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we repeatedly and enthusiastically shouted, 'Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!' 'Wishing our great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!'"

The Beijing Mining Bureau Revolutionary Committee held a broadcast meeting on the evening of June 30 to convey the great news of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin receiving the coal mine revolutionary worker representatives. The committee leader said, "Chairman Mao cares so much for us coal miners. We, the revolutionary miners living by Chairman Mao's side, must take Lei Feng as our example, live and fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and die for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." The revolutionary miners expressed their determination to resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words, to grasp the revolution, to vigorously promote production, and to exceed the production plan for May and June, producing even more coal to report to Chairman Mao.

The news reached the Anshan Coal Mine in Pingxiang, Jiangxi, where the revolutionary workers were overjoyed. They excitedly said, "Forty years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao came to Anshan Coal Mine, went down the mine, entered the dormitories, and led the Anshan workers in revolution. Today, Chairman Mao still cares deeply for the red sons and daughters of Anshan and the revolutionary workers of the national coal mines, continuously pointing the way forward for us. We must carry forward the revolutionary tradition, strive for greater glory, and contribute more to the socialist revolution and socialist construction of our motherland."

The news reached the coal mines in Hebei Province, such as Kaiping, Jingxing, Fengfeng, and Xiahuayuan, which had completed their production plans for the first half of the year ahead of schedule. The workers on the surface held nighttime celebrations, while the workers underground immediately launched a coal-grabbing battle, setting a new record for coal production per shift that night. Many old workers, holding red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and said excitedly, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! In the old society, we were called 'coal blackies' by the capitalists and had no political status at all. Today, you, Chairman Mao, have received our representatives again and again, placing great hopes in us. We will not disappoint you. We will forever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions, becoming good miners who are loyal to your revolutionary line. The members of the revolutionary committees of various coal mines excitedly expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to inherit and carry forward the party's fine traditions, to closely connect with the masses, to unite the broad masses of workers, to launch a new high tide of seizing the revolution and promoting production, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

The revolutionary workers of coal mines in Liaoning Province, such as Benxi, Fuxin, Fushun, and Beipiao, were extremely excited and joyful over the past two days. The miners said excitedly, "Our great leader Chairman Mao is in good health, which is the greatest happiness for the people of the entire nation. Chairman Mao is close to our hearts, and we miners are always close to Chairman Mao." They expressed their determination to think about consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and to put effort into seizing the revolution and promoting production, steadfastly advancing along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary workers of Benxi Mining Bureau, who had completed their production plan for the first half of the year ahead of schedule, decided to grasp class struggle without wavering, to launch a relentless attack on the class enemy, to carry out revolutionary criticism without stopping, to seize the revolution and promote production without relaxing, and to continue the good momentum of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

After the news reached the coal production bases of Shuangyashan, Jixi, and Hetian in Heilongjiang Province, the revolutionary workers immediately launched a wave of seizing the revolution and promoting production to express their loyalty to Chairman Mao and to present a gift to the party's birthday. The old workers of Shuangyashan Mine said excitedly, "In the evil old society, the capitalists treated us like cattle and horses. This year, in less than two months, Chairman Mao has received our miner representatives twice. This is the greatest care and the greatest inspiration for us. We will put all our effort into seizing the revolution and promoting production, repaying Chairman Mao's care with practical actions. Today, both Shuangyashan and Jixi mines set new records for coal mining and tunneling."

Chairman Mao's warm care for the revolutionary workers of the coal mines became a great force for the workers in Henan Province to achieve victories in both revolution and production. On the evening of June 30, the news spread across the coal industry in the entire province that four mining areas and 23 coal mines had completed their June or first-half-year national plans ahead of schedule. The revolutionary workers of mining areas such as Jiaozuo, Hengshan, Pingdingshan, Xinmi, and Yima launched fierce attacks on a handful of class enemies on the surface while engaging in coal-grabbing battles underground. They decided to report to Chairman Mao with even more outstanding achievements. Some members of the revolutionary committees of Pingdingshan and Hengshan Mining Bureaus put on their work clothes and went down to the mines to propagate the great significance of Chairman Mao receiving the coal mine worker representatives and to create new high-yield records with the workers. The coal output of Pingdingshan Mine on July 1 in the first two shifts exceeded that of the previous day by more than a thousand tons.

The news reached the coal mines in Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Inner Mongolia, and Ningxia, where the revolutionary workers held celebrations. The revolutionary workers of Zaozhuang Coal Mine in Shandong, Datong Coal Mine in Shanxi, and Huainan Coal Mine in Anhui said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao cares so much for us coal miners. We must remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of 'never forget class struggle' and carry forward the spirit of the proletarian thorough revolution of 'not stopping until we reach the Great Wall.' We will achieve greater victories in class struggle and production struggle."

The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in various coal mines across the country to carry out the "three supports and two militaries" tasks were also immersed in boundless joy upon hearing the news. They expressed their determination to better implement Chairman Mao's great call of "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left," to seize the revolution and promote production with the revolutionary workers, and to achieve new victories in the great struggle for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
