Our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "Universities must still be run, and here I am mainly talking about universities of science and engineering which must still be run. However, the system of school years must be shortened, education must be revolutionized, and proletarian politics must take command. We must follow the road of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in training technical personnel from among workers. We must select students from among workers and peasants who have practical experience, have them study in schools for a few years, and then have them return to productive practice." Chairman Mao's latest instructions speak straight to the hearts of us workers. The more I study them, the happier I feel, and the clearer my mind becomes. Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the battle program for the proletarian educational revolution and a long-term strategy for preventing revisionism. To implement this battle program, we workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and all laboring people can achieve a thorough emancipation in culture and science and technology. We can forever put an end to the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools. We can forever put an end to the bourgeois intellectuals' monopoly over science and technology, greatly unleash the wisdom and talents of workers and peasants, greatly accelerate the advent of a new industrial revolution, and rapidly build our country into a great socialist country with modern agriculture, modern industry, modern science and culture, and modern national defense. This will ensure that our great motherland remains red for a thousand generations, ten thousand generations, and forever!

I come from a poor peasant family. For three generations, no one in my family had ever set foot in a school. In 1947, I went to Shanghai as an apprentice. When I registered, someone wrote my name "Wang Peizhou" as "Wang Mingzhou," and I didn't even know. After liberation, thanks to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, I was able to attend night school, learn to recognize my own name, and find out that my name was written incorrectly in my household registration book. To repay Chairman Mao and the Communist Party for their great kindness, and to build socialism, I did everything I could to improve production. For the slightest contribution I made to the country, the Party and the people gave me great honor. In 1960, at the suggestion of Comrade Ke Qingshi, a good student of Chairman Mao, Shanghai promoted 136 workers to become engineers, and I was one of them. This was a great joy for our working class. When the news spread to the factory, the old workers gathered around me and said, "For so many years, we've never seen a worker become an engineer. Old Wang, you must do your best for Chairman Mao, for the Communist Party, and for us workers!" However, those bourgeois "experts" and reactionary "technical authorities" had always regarded the title of "engineer" as their private property. When they saw this rough worker become an engineer, they were truly more upset than if they had lost a piece of flesh. They did everything they could to exclude me, attack me, and ridicule me. It was so infuriating that it made my lungs burst with anger.

After being promoted to engineer, the factory assigned me to the central experimental room. At that time, I understood some practical production techniques but lacked theoretical knowledge. I thought, "It doesn't matter if I don't understand; I can just humbly learn from others, right?" At that time, there was a technician in the experimental room who was a university graduate. I sincerely asked him to teach me. I said to him, "I am a rough worker and don't understand things like XY. Can you teach me?" This guy heard me say this, picked up a bottle of ink from the table, and placed it in front of me, then said in a strange tone, "You have too little in your stomach; it's better not to learn." This was too much! Another time, he knew I had little education, but he handed me a blueprint and asked me to "review" it. I politely said to him, "Why don't you review it yourself?" He blurted out, "You are an engineer, and I am a technician. Your level should be higher than mine, right?" Then he asked me to calculate something about stiffness and strength. I bluntly said to him, "We workers don't know what stiffness and strength are; we only know 'can withstand' and 'cannot withstand.'" He coldly said, "Just relying on 'can withstand' and 'cannot withstand,' you want to be an engineer!" Listen, how infuriating!

These "experts" may talk so harshly, as if they have some great skills, but in reality, their technical level is really pathetic. "They talk big but fail in practice." One year, the country gave our factory an honorable task: to improve the quality of mining steel ropes and catch up with the international advanced level. The factory even set up an office specifically for this purpose and invited those "experts" to study behind closed doors. One of them searched high and low and found a "treasure" from a Japanese technical book, spending a lot of money and over a year, only to find out that this "treasure" was something from the 1930s. Isn't this ridiculous? During this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we workers took back the technical power from their hands, sent people to conduct investigations and research in the mines, and returned to prescribe the right medicine. In just half a year, we found the trick, which can extend the life of mining steel ropes by 1.6 times.

At that time, from these personal experiences, I deeply felt that we, the working class, must take back the technical power from those bourgeois "experts."

Not long after, Shanghai Science and Technology University began recruiting students, and the factory decided to send me to study. When I heard this news, I was overjoyed! Workers going to university, how could I not be happy? On the day of registration, the school sent someone to lead us on a tour and introduced: Shanghai Science and Technology University is a "regular" university, and it takes five years to graduate. To run this university, the country spent a lot of money, and an average of 19 yuan is spent on a student for one experiment. I heard the numbers "five years" and "19 yuan," and I was immediately stunned. Five years! My goodness, being away from production and away from worker brothers in these tall buildings for five years, what kind of person would I become? One class, one experiment costs 19 yuan, and in five years, how much money would the country spend? No, no, I definitely won't do it! The next day, I sneaked back to the factory under the pretext of transferring my household registration, saying I wouldn't go to such a university no matter what.

The factory saw that persuading me to go to the university of science and technology was not working, so they sent me to the Shanghai Half-Work Half-Study Industrial University. At the beginning, we workers were very satisfied with this school. It followed Comrade Ke Qingshi's advice and took the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in Yan'an as an example, promoting the "Three-Eighths" style, with a strong political atmosphere and teaching closely linked to practice. What we learned could be used immediately, which was very useful for technological innovation. Once, a factory's piston was worn out, seriously affecting production, causing a loss of tens of thousands of yuan per day. If replaced with a new one, it would cost a lot of money and take a long time, causing a huge loss to the country. A student from this factory brought this problem to the school and discussed it with everyone. A few of us got together, combining our practical experience with the theoretical knowledge we learned, to study the problem of piston repair. After research, we decided to use the "surface restoration" method to repair it. When this suggestion was proposed, some "experts" were so frightened that they stuck out their tongues: Could such a large thing (the piston is as high as two floors) be restored on the surface? We didn't listen to them and insisted on conducting experiments with the workers. After half a month of hard work, we finally overcame a series of technical difficulties and succeeded. The repaired piston was of better quality than a new one.

However, later, the capitalist-roaders within the Party at this half-work half-study industrial university, following the black instructions of the Shanghai agent of the Chinese Khrushchev, abandoned the spirit of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, pursued "regularization," and strove to align with full-time universities. The school years were extended from three to four, and students were not allowed to participate in political activities. This made us workers less satisfied with it. Especially the teaching content, adding more and more, introducing many things that were detached from reality. Usually, we were forced to memorize many formulas and principles, and during exams, we were given strange questions. This was really infuriating. For example, in our class, there was an old lathe worker with 30 years of experience, whose skills were of course excellent. Sometimes, some students encountered difficulties in production and went to him, and nine out of ten times they could find a solution. Who would have thought that during the exam for the tooling course, because the questions were strange and detached from production needs, this 30-year-old old lathe worker only got a "two" (out of ten). Take me as an example, I had worked for a few years in hot processing and had some practical experience in this area. Who would have thought that in a final exam, the teacher gave a few questions, including one called the "iron-carbon equilibrium diagram." This is a purely "theoretical" question with no use in actual production. I didn't learn it myself, so of course, I couldn't answer it. But in this exam, this question accounted for half of the score. If this question was not answered, even if all the other questions were answered perfectly, it would only be a "two and a half," and I finally only got a "two." From these two examples, it can be seen that this half-work half-study industrial university was deeply poisoned by the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely criticize the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's series of brilliant instructions on educational revolution, insist on proletarian politics taking command, shorten the school years, reform education, and ensure that this school forever advances along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

    结束资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象
    上海第二钢铁厂革委会常委、上海半工半读工业大学毕业生、工人工程师　王佩洲
    我们伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”毛主席的最新指示，字字句句说到我们工人心坎里。我越学越高兴，越学心里越亮堂。毛主席的最新指示，是无产阶级教育革命的战斗纲领，是反修防修的百年大计。实现这个战斗纲领，我们工人、贫下中农，我们劳动人民就可以在文化上、科学技术上彻底翻身，就可以永远结束资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，就可以永远结束资产阶级知识分子对科学技术的垄断，大大地发挥我们工人农民的聪明才智，大大加快新的工业革命的到来，迅速地把我国建设成为一个具有现代农业、现代工业、现代科学文化和现代国防的伟大社会主义国家，保证我们的伟大祖国千年红、万代红，世世代代永远红！
    我出身于贫农家庭。我家祖宗三代，从来没有一个人进过学校门。一九四七年我到上海当学徒，报户口的时候，人家把我的名字“王佩洲”写成“王明洲”，我也不知道。解放以后，托毛主席和共产党的福，我才进了业余小学，才认识自己的名字，才知道自己户口簿上的名字写错了。为了报答毛主席和共产党的大恩情，为了建设社会主义，我想尽办法搞好生产。我为国家稍微做出些贡献，党和人民就给了我很大荣誉。一九六○年，在毛主席的好学生柯庆施同志的提议下，上海从工人中提拔了一百三十六名工程师，我也是其中之一。这是我们工人阶级的一件大喜事。这件事一传到厂里，老工人都围着我，说：“多少年来也没有看见工人当工程师，老王，你可要替毛主席争气，替共产党争气，替我们工人争气，好好地干啊！”可是，那些资产阶级“专家”，那些反动技术“权威”，他们从来就把“工程师”这个头衔看作他们的私有财产，一看到我这个大老粗当了工程师，真比咬掉他们一块肉还难受，拚命排挤我，打击我，讽刺我，说起来真叫人火冒天灵盖，连肺都要气炸了。
    我被提拔为工程师以后，厂里调我到中心试验室工作。当时，我懂得一些实际生产技术，缺乏理论知识。心想：不懂不要紧，虚心向人家学不就行了吗？那时候，试验室里有个技术员，是个大学毕业生。我诚心诚意地向他求教。我对他说：“我这个人是个大老粗，什么ＸＹ，弄也弄不清，请你教教我好不好？”这个家伙一听我这么说，先在桌子上拿起一瓶墨水朝我面前一放，然后死样怪气地说：“你肚皮里这个东西太少了，还是不要学算了。”真是欺人太甚！又有一次，他明知我文化低，却拿了张图纸来叫我“审查”。我很客气地对他说：“你审查审查不就行了吗！”他冲口就这么一句：“你是工程师，我是技术员，你的水平应该比我高嘛！”接下来，他就要我计算什么刚度和强度，我直截了当地对他说：“我们工人不晓得什么刚度、强度，只晓得‘吃得消’‘吃勿消’。”他就冷冷地说道：“光凭
  ‘吃得消’‘吃勿消’，就做工程师啦！”听听，这有多气人！
    别看这些“专家”讲话这么刻薄，好象有什么了不起的本领，实际上这些家伙的技术水平也实在可怜得很。“讲讲头头是道，做做到处碰壁”。有一年，国家交给我们厂一项光荣任务：提高矿用钢丝绳的质量，赶超国际先进水平。厂里还特地搞了个赶超办公室，请那些“专家”闭门研究。有一个家伙，东寻西觅，从日本技术书籍上找到了一个“宝”，花了不少钱，搞了一年多，后来发现这个“宝”还是人家一九三○年的东西，这不是活见鬼是什么？在这次无产阶级文化大革命运动里，我们工人从他们手里把技术大权夺了回来，派人深入矿山调查研究，回来对症下药，只花了半年时间，就找到了窍门，可以使矿用钢丝绳的寿命延长一点六倍。
    那时候，我从这些亲身经历中，深深地感到，我们工人阶级不把技术大权从那些资产阶级“专家”手里夺过来是不行的。
    隔了没有多少时候，上海科技大学招生了，厂里决定送我去学习。一听到这个消息，我真高兴极了！工人进大学，还不高兴吗？报到那一天，学校里派人领我们参观，向我们介绍：科技大学是个“正规”大学，要读五年才能毕业。为了办这所大学，国家花了不少的钱，一个学生做一项试验，平均要十九元……。我一听“五年”和“十九元”这两个数字，马上呆住了。五年！我的天，脱离生产实际，脱离工人弟兄，在这高楼大厦里耽五年，我就要变成一个什么样的人啊！上一堂课、做一项试验要花十九元，五年下来，要花国家多少钱啊！不干，不干，无论如何不干！第二天，我就以迁户口为名，偷偷地溜回厂里，说什么也不愿进这种大学。
    厂里见动员我进科大不行，就又把我送到市半工半读工业大学。对于这个学校，开始我们工人都是非常满意的。它按照柯庆施同志的意见，以延安“抗大”为榜样，搞三八作风，政治气氛很浓，教学同实际联系得也比较密切，学了就能用，对于搞技术革新很有用处。有一次，有一个工厂的塞柱磨损了，生产受到严重影响，每天要损失几万元，如果换新的，花钱多不说，而且慢得很，时间拖得太长，国家损失实在太大。这个厂的同学，把这个问题带到学校里，同大家一起商量。我们几个同学凑在一起，把实践经验和学到的理论知识结合起来，去研究塞柱修复问题。经过研究，我们决定用“表面恢复”的方法，来修复它。这个建议一提出，有的“专家”听了吓得吐舌头：这么个大家伙（塞柱有两层楼那么高），表面修复能行吗？我们不理他，坚决同工人一起搞试验，经过半个月的艰苦奋斗，终于克服了一连串技术上的困难，获得了成功。修复的塞柱，质量比新的还要好。
    可是，后来这所半工半读工业大学的党内走资派，秉承中国赫鲁晓夫在上海的代理人的黑指示，背着柯庆施同志，丢掉“抗大”精神，搞“正规化”，拚命“向全日制大学看齐”。学制从三年延长到四年，并且不让学生参加政治活动。这样一来，我们工人就不大喜欢它了。特别是教学内容，添了又添，加了又加，搞了不少脱离实际的东西。平常，要我们死背死记许多公式和原理，临到考试，尽出些古里古怪的题目。这实在令人恼火透顶。譬如说，我们这个班里，有个三十年的老车工，技术非常高明，经验当然更不用说了。有时候，有些同学在生产上碰到些难题，去找他，十有八九能得到解决。谁知道在考刀具这一门课的时候，因为出的是脱离生产需要的怪题目，这个三十年的老车工却只得了个“二分”。再拿我自己来说，搞了几年热加工，在这方面总还有点实践经验，那里晓得一次期终考试，教师出了几个题目，其中有一个叫“铁炭平衡图”。这是一个纯粹“理论性”的题目，对生产实际根本没有用，我自己也根本没有去学它，当然考不出。而在这次考试中，这个题目偏偏占了一半的分数，这个题目做不出，别的题目即使百分之百答对了，也不过得个二分半，最后我也只得了个二分。从这两个例子里可以看出，这个半工半读工业大学，受中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线的毒也很深。我们一定要以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，坚决执行毛主席关于教育革命的一系列光辉指示，坚持无产阶级政治挂帅，缩短学制，改革教育，保证这个学校永远沿着毛主席指引的方向不断前进。
