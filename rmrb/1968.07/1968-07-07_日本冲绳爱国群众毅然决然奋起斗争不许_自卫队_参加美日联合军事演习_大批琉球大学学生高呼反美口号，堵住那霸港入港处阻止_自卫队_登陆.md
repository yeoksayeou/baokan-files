A large number of students from Ryukyu University shouted anti-American slogans and blocked the entrance to Naha Port to prevent the "Self-Defense Forces" from landing.

New York, July 6th — According to a report from the Eastern News Agency, a group of patriotic students, workers, and citizens in Okinawa, Japan, held a resolute struggle at Naha Port on the 5th to oppose the landing of the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces." These members of the Japanese Ground "Self-Defense Forces" came to Okinawa to participate in U.S.-Japan joint military exercises as part of the aggressive policies of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries in Asia.

According to the report, more than 130 cadets from the Japanese Ground "Self-Defense Forces" school arrived at Naha Port in the afternoon of the 5th. When they began to disembark, a group of students from Ryukyu University held up signs reading "Oppose U.S.-Japan Joint Exercises" and protested against the "Self-Defense Forces" at the side door of the ship.

The members of the Japanese Ground "Self-Defense Forces" were taken aback by the students' protest actions and attempted to jump from the deck of the ship to the pier to board U.S. Army vehicles sent by the U.S. military and sneak into the U.S. military base. However, students from Ryukyu University blocked the entrance to the port and shouted anti-American slogans with high spirits. At this time, a group of students from Okinawa University, as well as workers and citizens from nearby areas, also rushed to the scene to join the struggle with the students from Ryukyu University.

The puppet government of Ryukyu was taken aback by this struggle and dispatched nearly 100 armed police to carry out a bloody suppression of the students and workers. However, the students and workers, undeterred by the armed police, surrounded the U.S. military vehicles and protested against the U.S. military authorities for using military vehicles to transport members of the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" to the U.S. military base.

The people of Okinawa rising up to oppose the landing of the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" is the first time this has happened.

The reactionary Sato government, in order to further tighten its cooperation with the U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression in Asia, has already sent the Ground "Self-Defense Forces" and Air "Self-Defense Forces" to Okinawa ten times to participate in U.S.-Japan joint military exercises.

According to a report from the Eastern News Agency, the struggle of Japanese students against U.S. imperialism's blatant interference in Japan's education and against the corrupt educational system of the Sato government is becoming increasingly widespread, dealing a heavy blow to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

At Keio University in Tokyo, students are vigorously opposing the university authorities' "joint research" on biological weapons with the support of U.S. military financial aid. Students are demanding that the university authorities immediately return the dirty money from U.S. imperialism. About 500 students on June 26th demanded that the university authorities' responsible persons come to the classroom and that the school accept the students' demands.

Students at Tokyo Toyo University are continuing a long-term struggle against the university authorities' unreasonable restrictions on students' self-governance activities and demanding that students participate in and adopt democratic methods to draw the architectural design of the university library. Due to the school's stubborn refusal to accept the students' legitimate demands, more than 200 students on June 27th went to the university headquarters and questioned the president and other school officials for more than 12 hours. The Sato government sent 300 armed police to the school to suppress the students, beat them, and arbitrarily arrested 172 students. On the 28th, 1,000 angry students held a meeting and demonstration on campus to protest the police suppression of students and demand the immediate release of the arrested students.

Students from the Literature Department of Tokyo University of Education went on strike on the 26th to protest the Sato government's attempt to move the university campus from Tokyo to Tsu County to serve the interests of monopoly capital.

    日本冲绳爱国群众毅然决然奋起斗争不许“自卫队”参加美日联合军事演习
    大批琉球大学学生高呼反美口号，堵住那霸港入港处阻止“自卫队”登陆
    新华社六日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本冲绳一批爱国学生、工人和市民五日在那霸港展开坚决斗争，反对日本“自卫队”登陆。这些日本陆上“自卫队”人员是根据美日反动派侵略亚洲的政策来冲绳参加美日联合军事演习的。
    据报道，日本陆上“自卫队”学校学员一百三十多人五日下午到达那霸港。当他们开始上岸的时候，琉球大学的一批学生高举“反对美日联合演习”的标语牌，在船舷侧门梯子旁向“自卫队”进行抗议。
    日本陆上“自卫队”人员在学生的抗议行动面前惊慌失措，企图从轮船甲板跳到码头乘美国陆军部队派来的汽车溜进美军基地。然而琉球大学的学生们堵住港口入口处，斗志昂扬地齐声高呼反美口号。此时，冲绳大学的一批学生以及附近的工人和市民也赶来现场同琉球大学的学生一起进行斗争。
    琉球傀儡政府被这场斗争弄得惊慌失措，派出将近一百名武装警察，对学生和工人进行血腥镇压。但是学生和工人不顾武装警察的镇压，他们包围了美帝军用车，并抗议美军当局用军用车运送日本“自卫队”人员前往美军基地。
    冲绳人民群众起来反对日本“自卫队”登陆，这是第一次。
    佐藤反动政府为了进一步加紧同美帝国主义侵略亚洲政策的合作，迄今已经是第十次派遣陆上“自卫队”和航空“自卫队”到冲绳参加美日联合军事演习。
    据新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本学生反对美帝国主义粗暴干涉日本的教育、反对佐藤政府的腐朽教育制度的斗争日益广泛地开展，给予美日反动派以沉重的打击。
    在东京的庆应大学，学生竭力反对大学当局在美国军事财政援助下“联合研究”细菌武器。学生坚持要求学校当局立即退回美帝国主义的这笔肮脏的钱。大约五百名学生六月二十六日要求大学当局负责人到教室去，并要求校方接受学生的要求。
    东京东洋大学学生正在坚持长期斗争，反对学校当局无理限制学生的自治活动，要求有学生参加并采取民主方式绘制大学图书馆的建筑设计图。由于校方顽固地拒绝了学生的正当要求，六月二十七日被激怒了的两百多名学生来到大学本部，当面对校长和校方其他负责人进行了十二个小时以上的质问。佐藤政府派了三百名武装警察到学校镇压，对学生进行毒打，并无理逮捕了一百七十二名学生。一千名愤怒的学生二十八日在校内举行集会和示威游行，抗议警察镇压学生，并要求立即释放被捕学生。
    东京教育学院文学系学生二十六日举行罢课，抗议佐藤政府企图把大学校址从东京迁往茨木县，为垄断资本的利益服务。
