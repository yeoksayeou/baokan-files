Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The difficulties of the reactionary forces are insurmountable, because they are forces approaching death with no future."

The fascist military regime led by Suharto-Nasution faces increasingly severe political and economic crises. The development of the people's revolutionary armed struggle, the extreme chaos in finance and economy, and the power struggles within the right-wing military clique have placed the Indonesian fascist military regime in a dire situation both domestically and internationally. The situation in Indonesia is increasingly favorable to the revolutionary people and unfavorable to the Indonesian reactionaries.

The Pro-American, Traitorous Fascist Regime

The Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique is a puppet of American imperialism. It massacres and oppresses the people domestically and implements a pro-American, anti-Chinese counter-revolutionary policy abroad. Upon taking power, it hastened to engage in political collusion with American imperialism. It betrayed the Indonesian people's struggle against the neo-colonialist product "Malaysia" according to the wishes of American imperialism and reached a so-called "reconciliation" agreement with "Malaysia." It openly aligned with the reactionaries of Thailand, India, and other countries, fiercely opposing the great People's Republic of China, and eagerly serving American imperialism's policy of aggression and war in Asia.

Militarily, the Indonesian fascist traitorous regime signed a "military aid" agreement with the United States in April last year, sending military personnel to the United States for training and accepting a plan for the United States to train all Indonesian forces. Recently, American imperialism has openly decided to establish military bases in places like Cilacap in Indonesia to further bind Indonesia to the American war chariot.

Economically, it joined the American-controlled "World Bank" and the "International Monetary Fund" and other organizations, making Indonesian finance and currency completely controlled by the United States. It continuously accepts American "economic aid," reaching a total of eight hundred million dollars by the end of 1966.

After the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique came to power, it hastened to sell out Indonesian national interests. It signed an agreement with the United States to guarantee the safety of American private investments. According to this agreement, American capitalists have seized vast tracts of land from Sumatra to West Irian, including mines, rubber plantations, and forests. The four American oil companies—Standard Oil, Pan American, Texaco, and Shell—operating in North Sumatra, and the seven rubber plantations, which were previously taken over by the Indonesian government under popular pressure, have now been returned to the hands of the American monopolists. American monopolists, along with Japan and Canada, have divided the oil exploration rights in vast regions of Kalimantan, Sumatra, Java, and West Irian. According to the agreement, American monopolists have seized the copper mines in West Irian and, together with other imperialist countries, have taken over the iron ore mines in Sumatra, the nickel mines in Sulawesi, Kalimantan, and West Irian, and the tin mines on several islands off the coast of Sumatra. In addition, the Indonesian fascist military regime has handed over vast forests in West Irian, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Sumatra, and the Lesser Sunda Islands to the monopolies of the United States, Japan, and Australia. Suharto shamelessly admitted that his traitorous regime has "paved the way for foreign monopolies to invest in Indonesian industry."

The vast and beautiful lands of Indonesia are increasingly becoming a colony of American imperialism and a military base for its intensified aggression in Southeast Asia.

Financial and Economic Chaos

Under the rule of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique, Indonesia's finance and economy are in utter chaos, production is declining, and the people's lives are in dire straits.

Due to the betrayal of national interests by the Indonesian fascist military regime, commodities from imperialist countries are dumped in large quantities in the Indonesian market, severely impacting national industries, which are closing down one after another. Last year, the industrial production rate was only 20 to 30 percent. In Jakarta alone, more than 5,000 enterprises closed down from May onwards. Agricultural production has also been severely damaged. Various crops, especially rice, have seen consecutive years of reduced harvests. Due to the contraction of production and economic decline, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people in Indonesia reached 18 million last year.

With the sharp decline in industrial and agricultural production, Indonesia's export plans have completely failed. According to a report by the official Indonesian news agency Antara on December 29 last year, from January to September 1967 compared to the same period in 1966, the export income from rubber, coconut, tobacco, tea, and coconut oil decreased by 69 million dollars, with rubber, the main export commodity, seeing the largest decrease of 37 million dollars. Due to the reduction in exports, the domestic budget has a huge deficit. Last year, Indonesia's budget deficit reached 51 billion 290 million rupiah. To cover the budget deficit and maintain its shaky reactionary rule, the Indonesian fascist military regime has intensified its begging for imperialist "aid." According to Suharto's own budget report, by the end of 1967, Indonesia had already owed 27 billion dollars in foreign debt. This year, it still needs 325 million dollars in foreign loans, accounting for one-third of this year's total budget revenue. By the end of this year, Indonesia will owe 30 billion 250 million dollars in foreign debt.

Inflation in Indonesia is rampant, and prices are skyrocketing. Since the beginning of this year, the already high prices have continued to rise. In January, the price of rice in Jakarta rose from 23 rupiah per kilogram last year to 50 rupiah. Prices in other places are even higher, with rice in South Sumatra reaching 105 rupiah per kilogram, and in some areas even 150 rupiah.

Currently, the fertile and resource-rich archipelago nation is in a state of famine under the trampling and plundering of the Indonesian fascist military regime. Many starving people are filling their stomachs with cassava leaves and banana stems. Due to malnutrition, the number of people dying from edema is increasing. The number of starving people fleeing with their children is countless. The various retrogressive actions of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime have made it impossible for the broad masses of Indonesian workers, peasants, and urban poor to survive.

Revolutionary Armed Struggles Are Sweeping the Nation

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The tyranny of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime has sparked strong resistance from the Indonesian people. Over the past year, the Indonesian people's revolutionary armed struggle against the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime has been surging. Currently, the flames of the people's revolutionary armed struggle have spread to the main islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Sumatra. In particular, the people's armed forces active in West Kalimantan have established revolutionary base areas, and the revolutionary forces there already have a considerable number of people's armed forces.

In East Java, the people's revolutionary armed forces are active in the vast rural areas where the reactionary rule is weak, frequently launching guerrilla warfare. The scope of guerrilla activities includes the vast rural areas around the towns of Malang, Kediri, Surabaya, Madiun, and Wuradadi in East Java. By mid-March this year, the guerrilla forces, in close cooperation with local farmers, had executed nearly a hundred evil landlords, big landlords, and reactionary officials. It is particularly noteworthy that, inspired by the rise of the people's armed forces in East Java, 333 patriotic soldiers and police stationed in Malang defected to the people's revolutionary armed forces on February 15 this year. The Indonesian reactionaries exclaimed, "The Communist Party's forces have controlled a forested area in East Java," and have already established an "impregnable fortress" there.

In Central Java, according to the Indonesian military authorities, Indonesian communists are actively arming the peasants and creating base areas. The flames of revolutionary armed struggle are burning more fiercely. The facts prove that there is immense revolutionary power among the Indonesian people.

The Infighting Among the Reactionaries Is Escalating

Under the heavy blows of the Indonesian people's armed struggle, the contradictions within the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique are intensifying. The power struggle between Suharto and Nasution is becoming increasingly fierce. In March this year, Suharto, in order to climb from the position of "acting president" to the "president's" throne, engaged in an extremely fierce struggle with his political opponent, the veteran right-wing military figure Nasution. At the same time, the contradictions and struggles between the Indonesian fascist military clique and various reactionary parties, as well as among the various political factions within the reactionary camp, are becoming increasingly heated. The Indonesian right-wing military ruling clique is facing multiple crises and is in a state of panic.

The Indonesian fascist military clique, based on the backward and fragile social and economic organization of Indonesia, is extremely weak. They are unpopular, betraying the country, anti-communist, and anti-people. They are powerless.

The revolutionary armed forces of the Indonesian people are new and progressive forces. New forces are invincible to any reactionary forces. The Indonesian revolutionary forces, as long as they further penetrate into the countryside, rely on and mobilize the broad masses of impoverished peasants, continuously establish and expand revolutionary base areas in the countryside, and persist in long-term armed struggle, will certainly achieve the final victory of the revolutionary struggle.

    内外交困中的印尼反动派
    肖桂
    我们的伟大导师毛主席指出：“反动势力的困难是不可能克服的，因为他们是接近于死亡的没有前途的势力”。
    以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印尼法西斯军人政权，面临着日益严重的政治和经济危机。人民革命武装斗争的发展，财政经济的极度混乱，以及右派军人集团内部争权夺利的争斗，使得印尼法西斯军人政权陷于内外交困的境地。印度尼西亚形势的发展，越来越有利于革命人民，而不利于印尼反动派。
      亲美卖国的法西斯政权
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团，是美帝国主义豢养的走狗。它对内屠杀和压榨人民，对外实行亲美反华的反革命政策。它一上台，就加紧同美帝国主义进行政治勾结。它按照美帝国主义的意旨，背叛印尼人民对抗新殖民主义产物“马来西亚”的斗争，同“马来西亚”达成了所谓“和解”协议。它同泰国、印度等国的反动派公开合流，疯狂反对伟大的中华人民共和国，并且卖力地为美帝国主义在亚洲推行的侵略政策和战争政策效劳。
    在军事上，印尼法西斯卖国政权于去年四月同美国签订了“军事援助”协定，派遣军人到美国受训，接受由美国训练印尼所有部队的军事训练计划。最近，美帝国主义又公然决定在印尼的芝拉札等地建立军事基地，以便进一步把印尼绑在美国的战车上。
    在经济上，它参加美国控制的“世界银行”以及“国际货币基金组织”等机构，使印尼的金融货币完全受美国控制。它不断地接受美国的经济“援助”，到一九六六年底止，接受美“援”已达八亿美元之多。
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团上台以后，加紧出卖印尼的民族利益。它同美国签订了保证美国私人投资安全的协定。根据这一协定，美国资本家霸占了从苏门答腊到西伊里安的辽阔国土上的大片矿藏、橡胶园和森林。美国垄断资本家过去在印尼开设的美孚、泛美、德士古、壳牌四家美国石油公司和在北苏门答腊经营的七个橡胶园，曾在人民的压力下被印尼前政府接管过来，现在，美国垄断资本家又从苏哈托—纳苏蒂安卖国政权手里收回去了。美国垄断资本家同日本、加拿大一起，瓜分了加里曼丹、苏门答腊、爪哇和西伊里安等岛屿上辽阔地区的石油勘探权。根据协定，美国垄断资本霸占了西伊里安的铜矿，并且同其他一些帝国主义国家一起，夺取了苏门答腊的铁矾土矿，苏拉威西、加里曼丹和西伊里安的镍矿，以及苏门答腊外围若干岛屿上的锡矿。另外，印尼法西斯军人政权还把西伊里安、加里曼丹、苏拉威西、苏门答腊和廖岛等地的辽阔森林奉送给美国、日本、澳大利亚的垄断财团。苏哈托厚颜无耻地供认，他的卖国政权为外国垄断资本“在印尼的工业投资铺平了道路”。
    印尼的大好河山，日益沦为美帝国主义的殖民地和它加紧侵略东南亚的军事基地。
            财政经济一片混乱
    在苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团统治下的印度尼西亚，财政经济一片混乱，生产凋敝，人民生活陷于水深火热之中。
    由于印尼法西斯军人政权出卖民族利益，帝国主义国家的商品在印尼市场上大量倾销，民族工业受到严重的打击，纷纷倒闭。去年工业生产开工率只达到百分之二十至三十。仅雅加达市，去年五月以来就有五千家企业关门。农业生产也遭到严重的破坏。各种农作物，特别是大米生产连年减产。由于生产萎缩，经济凋敝，去年印尼全国失业和半失业人数达到一千八百万。
    随着工农业生产的急剧下降，印尼的出口计划也彻底破产了。据印尼官方喉舌安塔拉通讯社去年十二月二十九日透露，一九六七年头九个月同一九六六年同期比较，橡胶、椰子、烟叶、茶叶和椰油出口收入下降六千九百万美元，其中作为主要出口货物的橡胶的出口收入下降最多，达三千七百万美元。由于出口减少，国内财政出现庞大赤字。去年印尼财政赤字达五十一亿二千九百万盾。印尼法西斯军人政权为了弥补财政亏空，以维持其岌岌可危的反动统治，便加紧乞求帝国主义“援助”。据苏哈托自己在预算报告中透露，到一九六七年止，印尼已欠外债二十七亿美元。今年还需要外债三亿二千五百万美元，占今年预算总收入的三分之一。这样，到今年年底，印尼将欠外债达三十亿零二千五百万美元。
    印尼通货膨胀，物价惊人地上涨。今年入春以来，已够高昂的物价仍然节节上升。一月份，雅加达大米价格由去年每公斤二十三盾上涨到五十盾。其他地方的米价更高，南苏门答腊每公斤大米高达一百零五盾，有的地区甚至高达一百五十盾。
    目前，土地肥沃、物产富饶的千岛之国，在印尼法西斯军人政权的蹂躏和洗劫下，全国各地呈现一片饥饿的悲惨景象。许多饥民以木薯叶、香蕉茎充饥。由于营养不足，患水肿病而死亡的人越来越多。饥民携儿带女外出逃荒的，更是数不胜数。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权的种种倒行逆施，使印尼广大工人、农民和城市贫民求生而不得。
          革命武装斗争风起云涌
    有压迫就有反抗。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权的暴政，激起了印尼人民强烈的反抗。一年多来，印尼人民反抗苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权的革命武装斗争此伏彼起。目前，人民革命武装斗争的烽火，已经蔓延到爪哇、加里曼丹、苏拉威西和苏门答腊等主要岛屿。特别是活跃在西加里曼丹的人民武装力量，已经建立了革命根据地，那里的革命力量已经拥有一支相当规模的人民武装。
    在东爪哇，人民革命武装力量活跃在反动统治薄弱的广大农村地区，频繁地开展游击战。游击活动的范围包括东爪哇的玛琅、谏义里、外南梦、任抹、勿里达等市镇周围的广阔农村。到今年三月中旬，游击队在当地农民的密切配合下，处决了近百名恶霸地主、大土豪劣绅和反动官吏。特别值得注意的是，在东爪哇人民武装力量兴起的鼓舞下，驻在玛琅的印尼三百三十名爱国官兵和警察，于今年二月十五日弃暗投明，投奔人民革命武装。印尼反动派惊呼，“共产党部队已控制了东爪哇一个密林地区”，并且已经在那里建立了一个
  “不易攻破的堡垒”。
    在中爪哇，据印尼军事当局透露，印尼共产党人正在积极武装农民，创建根据地。革命武装斗争的烈火越烧越旺。事实证明，印尼人民中间蕴藏着巨大的革命力量。
          狗咬狗的争斗愈演愈烈
    在印尼人民武装斗争的沉重打击下，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团内部矛盾日益加剧。苏哈托和纳苏蒂安之间勾心斗角、争权夺利的狗咬狗的争斗愈演愈烈。今年三月，苏哈托为了从“代总统”爬上“总统”的宝座，就曾同他的政治对手、老牌的右派军人纳苏蒂安进行了一场极其激烈的较量。同时，印尼法西斯军人集团同各反动政党之间以及反动派内部各政治派系之间的矛盾和斗争也日益白热化。印尼右派军人统治集团正面临重重危机，处于惶惶不可终日的困境。
    立足于印尼落后的脆弱的社会经济组织之上的印尼法西斯军人集团是十分虚弱的。他们卖国，反共，反人民，是不得人心的，脱离人民的。他们是没有力量的。
    印尼人民的革命武装力量是新生的、进步的力量，新生的力量是任何反动势力所不能压倒的。印尼革命力量，只要进一步深入农村，依靠和发动广大贫苦农民，在农村不断建立和扩大革命的根据地，坚持长期的武装斗争，就一定能够取得革命斗争的最后胜利。
