	Forever Loyal to Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line
	Vice Commander of a Guangzhou Military Region Unit, Red Army Veteran Wang Hongrong

	On June 30, 1968, I had the fortune once again to see our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao. When Chairman Mao walked to the front of the platform with steady steps, smiling broadly, and waving to us repeatedly, I, as an old guard who once followed Chairman Mao, saw that he was in extremely good health and full of energy. I felt extremely happy from the bottom of my heart. I could not contain my excitement and shouted a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao! I wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Under your proletarian revolutionary line, the ship of revolution has corrected its course, avoided reefs, crossed rapids and dangerous shoals, and moved from victory to victory. Your revolutionary line is our lifeline!

	In early 1936, I served as a cavalry platoon leader in the Central Guard Regiment. Shortly afterward, I was transferred to the Special Duty Company of the General Headquarters, shouldering the glorious task of protecting Chairman Mao and the Central Committee. During a mission to escort Vice Chairman Lin Biao, Premier Zhou Enlai, and other Central leaders, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, in the midst of his busy schedule, personally explained the situation and tasks of the anti-Japanese war to us. He also kindly told us that Chairman Mao has the greatest revolutionary foresight and grandeur. As long as we firmly follow Chairman Mao's words and act according to his instructions, we will achieve victory. I always remember Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions and firmly believe in Chairman Mao's teachings. Although sometimes I did not fully understand Chairman Mao's instructions, I had only one belief: to carry them out resolutely and deepen my understanding in the process of execution.

	In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, at the beginning, due to my insufficient understanding of the revolutionary mass movement, I was relatively passive in the "three supports, two militaries" work. But I firmly believe that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is brilliant, great, and correct. I followed Chairman Mao's instruction, "You must put politics in command, go to the masses, be with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." I put aside my arrogance, went deep into the revolutionary masses, humbly sought advice from the masses, often solicited their opinions, and listened to their criticisms. Whenever I found a mistake, I corrected it immediately. At the same time, I actively sought out revolutionary masses who had opposing sentiments towards me for heart-to-heart talks, eliminating mutual misunderstandings. On the principle basis of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, my connection with the revolutionary masses became closer, and our feelings grew deeper. They would tell me anything they wanted to say, raise any opinions they had, and consult me on any problems; they would also humbly accept any shortcomings I pointed out. In this way, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, we kept the focus of our struggle on the handful of diehard capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists within the party, and launched a fierce attack on the class enemies. We did our best to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Recently, Chairman Mao has pointed out with great wisdom: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction made me further realize that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the most thorough mass line, a revolutionary line that protects the revolutionary masses and serves the Chinese people and the people of the world wholeheartedly. The more thoroughly one serves the people, the more loyal one is to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! I am determined to take Vice Chairman Lin Biao as a shining example, to study hard, carry out, enthusiastically propagate, and defend with my life your revolutionary line. I will serve the people all my life and be a guard of your revolutionary line all my life.

    永远忠于毛主席的革命路线
    广州部队某部副部队长、红军老战士　王洪荣
    一九六八年六月三十日，我再一次幸福地见到了我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席。当毛主席迈着稳健的步伐走到主席台前，满面笑容，向我们频频招手时，我作为一个曾经跟随在毛主席身边的警卫老战士，看到他老人家身体非常非常健康，精力非常非常充沛，从心底里感到格外幸福。我按捺不住激动的心情，千遍万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！在您的无产阶级革命路线指引下，才使革命的航船拨正了航向，绕过了暗礁，渡过了急流险滩，从胜利走向胜利。您的革命路线就是我们的命根子！
    一九三六年初，我就在中央警卫团担任骑兵排长，不久又调到总部特务连，肩负着保卫毛主席、保卫党中央的光荣任务。在一次执行护送林副主席、周总理等中央首长的任务中，林副主席于百忙之中，亲自给我讲了当时抗日战争的形势和任务，并亲切地告诉我们，毛主席最具有革命的远见和伟大的气魄，只要我们坚定不移地听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事，就能取得胜利。我时刻牢记林副主席的指示，对毛主席的教导坚信不疑，尽管有时对毛主席的指示不很理解，但我只有一个信念，就是坚决执行，在执行中去加深理解。
    在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，一开始，由于我对革命群众运动认识不足，因而在“三支”、“两军”工作中，显得比较被动。但我坚信毛主席的无产阶级革命路线英明、伟大和正确。我遵照毛主席“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的教导，放下架子，深入到革命群众中去，遇事虚心向群众请教，经常征求群众的意见，听取群众的批评。发现自己一有错误，就立即改正。同时，我还主动地找那些同自己有对立情绪的革命群众谈心交心，消除互相之间的隔阂。在毛主席革命路线的原则基础上，我和革命群众之间的联系越来越紧密，感情越来越深厚。他们有什么话就对我说，有什么意见就向我提，有什么问题就找我商量；他们有什么缺点，我一指出来他们也能够虚心接受。这样，我们在毛主席的一系列最新指示的指引下，把斗争的矛头始终对准党内一小撮顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务，以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，主动地向阶级敌人展开猛烈的进攻，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利尽了自己的力量。
    最近，毛主席英明地指出：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”毛主席这一光辉指示使我进一步认识到，毛主席的革命路线是最彻底的群众路线，是保护革命群众，全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务的革命路线。为人民服务得越彻底，对毛主席的革命路线越忠诚。毛主席啊，毛主席！我决心以林副主席为光辉榜样，努力学习、坚决贯彻、热情宣传、誓死捍卫您的革命路线，为人民服务一辈子，当一辈子捍卫您的革命路线的警卫战士。
