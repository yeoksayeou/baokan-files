	PLA Unit Helps Capital Cement Factory Revolutionary Committee Launch Scathing Criticism Against Class Enemies

	The sustained development of revolutionary criticism has facilitated the deepening of the work to clean up class ranks. The class struggle and two-line struggle awareness of the broad revolutionary masses of workers has been continuously enhanced, and the revolutionary and production situation has been getting better and better.

	According to a report, the advanced collective attending the Second Conference of Active Learners and Appliers of Mao Zedong Thought of the Beijing Military Region Artillery, the PLA support-left personnel stationed at the Capital Cement Factory, in accordance with the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle," helped the factory's revolutionary committee guide the broad revolutionary masses of workers to carry out revolutionary criticism, and actively launch a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies. They combined the work of cleaning up class ranks with the intense focus on revolutionary criticism, making the firepower of revolutionary criticism both fierce and sustained. They accurately and forcefully struck at a handful of class enemies, raised the class struggle and two-line struggle awareness of the broad revolutionary masses of workers, and strengthened the dictatorship of the proletariat. The entire factory is in a state of revolutionary fervor, and production is booming. The situation is getting better and better.

	The Capital Cement Factory was originally a factory under the rule of Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Over the past decade or so since liberation, the Chinese Khrushchev and the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, along with their agents in the factory, actively promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, recruited traitors, formed cliques, and promoted a handful of traitors, spies, and remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries. During the Cultural Revolution, these scoundrels, unwilling to face their own demise, ran amok, actively colluded with the capitalist roaders to hatch conspiracies, spread poisonous winds, and set off ghost fires, brutally suppressing the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. Some even infiltrated the masses' organizations, repeatedly instigating armed struggles, and deliberately disrupting the direction of the struggle, causing serious losses to the revolution and production.

	Facing such a complex and sharp class struggle situation, the PLA support-left personnel and the revolutionary committee of the factory repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great instruction that "one of our important tasks on the ideological front is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." They guided the broad revolutionary masses of workers to fully use the weapon of revolutionary criticism to attack the class enemies. However, at the beginning, due to the insufficient understanding of revolutionary criticism by some workers, they did not closely combine revolutionary criticism with the work of cleaning up class ranks, and only focused on grabbing and struggling against a handful of class enemies, neglecting their thorough exposure and political and ideological criticism. Therefore, after a long time, some people thought that these guys had become "dead tigers" and failed to see their reactionary essence. In response to this situation, the revolutionary committee and the PLA support-left personnel held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organizing the broad revolutionary masses of workers to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and fiercely criticize the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" spread by Chinese Khrushchev. They organized old workers who had been beaten by the Japanese devils and oppressed by the Kuomintang reactionaries in the old society to recall their bitterness; they guided the revolutionary masses of workers to extensively discuss the facts of the fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines within the factory over the past decade or so since the founding of the nation, and to expose the ongoing sabotage activities of a handful of traitors, spies, and remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries during the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and after the establishment of the revolutionary committee. The shocking facts of class struggle made everyone realize that "the imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never reconcile themselves to their failure; they will make their last struggle." "Class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological field, will be long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense.... The question of who will win between socialism and capitalism has not been truly resolved." Through extensive discussion of the enemy situation, many workers believed that if these scoundrels were not all exposed now, they would unite as soon as there was a slight disturbance, seize back the power obtained by the revolutionary people, and continue to lord over the people, making the revolutionary workers suffer twice and endure twice the hardship. This aroused the broad masses of workers' determination to fight against the enemy.

	After the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instruction on the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, which is essentially a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions, and is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its led broad revolutionary masses of people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the revolutionary committee and the PLA support-left personnel immediately mobilized the broad masses to consciously engage in the battle to clean up class ranks and create a strong atmosphere of fighting against the enemy. At this time, a handful of unrepentant capitalist roaders in the factory stirred up a rightist backlash wind, directly aiming at the newly born revolutionary committee and the People's Liberation Army. A self-proclaimed lifelong fighter against the old party committee, a counter-revolutionary two-faced person, jumped out, advocating for the capitalist roaders and untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to overturn the newly born revolutionary committee. The broad revolutionary masses of workers were very indignant and denounced the crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries in cruelly persecuting workers. The more they criticized, the more they hated the class enemies, realizing that this scoundrel was a black nail planted by the capitalist roaders in the revolutionary ranks. During the Cultural Revolution, he ran amok, using all kinds of despicable tricks, firmly protecting the capitalist roaders, repeatedly instigating armed struggles, and fiercely spreading the counter-revolutionary economic wind, sabotaging production. Through revolutionary criticism, revolutionary workers exposed him and smashed the enemy's new counterattack.

	The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." Based on the serious study of Chairman Mao's latest instruction, the broad revolutionary masses immediately criticized the crimes of Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party who "strike a large area and protect a small number," and combined with the criticism of the capitalist roaders in this factory who gathered traitors and spies and other remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, criticized their crimes of implementing white terror among the masses, suppressing revolutionary masses in the personnel issue, and pushing for a large-scale dismissal of officials. At the same time, they correctly distinguished between the two types of contradictions, expanded the scope of education, and won over the deceived masses, making those who made mistakes quickly realize and join the battle to expose and criticize class enemies. The unity among the broad revolutionary masses has been strengthened to an unprecedented extent, and the handful of class enemies have been maximally isolated and struck.

	The revolutionary committee of the Capital Cement Factory and the PLA personnel stationed in the factory, in their attack on class enemies, guided the revolutionary workers to always combine revolutionary criticism with the work of cleaning up class ranks. Therefore, they not only fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of Chinese Khrushchev but also exposed the bad elements hidden in the revolutionary ranks, further purifying the ranks of the working class. At present, the entire factory is in a great situation of revolution and production, and the revolutionary committee has been consolidated and developed.

    人民解放军某部支左人员帮助首都水泥厂革命委员会
    用革命大批判武器向阶级敌人猛烈进攻
    革命大批判的持续开展，促使清理阶级队伍的工作不断深入，广大革命职工群众阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟不断提高，革命和生产形势越来越好
    本报讯　出席北京部队炮兵第二次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会的先进集体、驻首都水泥厂解放军支左人员，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，帮助厂革命委员会引导广大革命职工开展革命的大批判，主动地向一小撮阶级敌人猛烈进攻。他们把清理阶级队伍同狠抓革命大批判结合起来，使革命大批判的火力又猛烈，又持久，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人，提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，强化了无产阶级专政。全厂革命轰轰烈烈，生产热气腾腾，形势越来越好。
    首都水泥厂原来是日本帝国主义和国民党反动派统治下的一个工厂。解放十几年来，由于中国赫鲁晓夫、彭真反革命修正主义集团以及他们在这个厂的代理人积极推行反革命修正主义路线，招降纳叛，结党营私，一小撮叛徒、特务、国民党反动派的残渣余孽受到提拔重用。在文化大革命中，这些坏家伙不甘心于自己的灭亡，上窜下跳，积极配合走资派大搞阴谋活动，煽阴风，点鬼火，残酷镇压无产阶级革命派；有人还钻入群众组织内部，多次挑起武斗，极力干扰斗争大方向，使革命、生产遭到严重损失。
    面对这样复杂、尖锐的阶级斗争情况，解放军驻厂支左人员和革命委员会反复学习了毛主席关于“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”的伟大教导，引导广大革命职工充分运用革命大批判的武器，向阶级敌人进攻。但是开始由于部分职工对革命大批判的认识不足，没有把革命的大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作紧密结合起来，对一小撮阶级敌人只顾揪斗，忽视了对他们彻底的揭发和从政治上、思想上的批判。所以时间一长，有人认为这些家伙已经成为“死老虎”，看不清其反动本质。针对这种情况，革命委员会和解放军驻厂支左人员就大办毛泽东思想学习班，组织广大革命职工反复学习毛主席的一系列最新指示，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。他们组织在旧社会挨过日本鬼子毒打、受过国民党反动派压榨的老工人进行忆苦；引导革命职工群众，大谈建国十几年来厂内两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈斗争的事实，大揭一小撮叛徒、特务、国民党反动派残渣余孽在无产阶级文化大革命中以及成立革命委员会后的现行破坏活动。触目惊心的阶级斗争事实，使大家认识到“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”“阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。……社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。”通过大摆敌情，很多职工认为，现在如果不把这些坏家伙都揪出来，一有风吹草动，他们还会结成一体，把革命人民得到的权力重新篡夺过去，继续骑在人民头上作威作福，使革命工人再吃二遍苦，重受二茬罪。从而激发了广大职工对敌斗争的决心。
    伟大领袖毛主席关于“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”最新指示发表后，革委会和解放军支左人员立即发动广大群众自觉地投入清理阶级队伍的战斗，把对敌斗争的气氛搞得浓浓的。正在这时，厂内一小撮死不改悔的走资派刮起了一股右倾翻案妖风，把矛头直接指向了新生的革命委员会，指向了人民解放军。一个自称为一贯和旧党委作斗争的反革命两面派，跳了出来，为走资派和没改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子翻案，妄图颠覆新生的革命委员会。广大革命职工群众十分气愤，控诉了国民党反动派残酷迫害工人的罪行。大家越批对阶级敌人越恨，从而认识到这个坏家伙是走资派安插在革命队伍中的黑钉子。在文化大革命中他上窜下跳，用尽了卑鄙伎俩，死保走资派，多次挑起武斗，大刮反革命经济主义妖风，破坏生产。通过革命大批判，革命职工把他揭露出来，粉碎了阶级敌人的新反扑。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”广大革命职工在认真学习毛主席这一最新指示的基础上，立即针对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的罪行，结合批判了本厂走资派网罗叛徒、特务等国民党反动派残渣余孽，批判他们在干部问题上推行大罢官，在群众中实行白色恐怖，镇压革命群众的反革命罪行。同时正确地区分了两类不同性质的矛盾，扩大了教育面，争取教育了受蒙蔽群众，使犯错误的人迅速觉悟过来，参加了揭发批判阶级敌人的战斗。广大革命群众之间的团结空前加强，最大限度地孤立和打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    首都水泥厂革命委员会和解放军驻厂人员在向阶级敌人的进攻中，由于引导革命职工始终把革命大批判同清理阶级队伍工作很好地结合起来，所以既狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义谬论，又揭露了隐藏在革命队伍里的坏人，进一步纯洁了工人阶级的队伍。目前，全厂革命和生产一片大好形势，革命委员会也得到了巩固和发展。
