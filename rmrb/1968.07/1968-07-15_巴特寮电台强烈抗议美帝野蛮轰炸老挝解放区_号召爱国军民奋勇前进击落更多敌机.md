Pathet Lao Radio recently issued a commentary strongly protesting the recent savage bombing of Lao liberation zones by U.S. air pirates. It called on Lao patriotic military personnel and civilians to press forward bravely, annihilate more enemies, and shoot down more enemy planes.

The commentary said that in recent days, U.S. pirate planes have carried out extremely savage and indiscriminate bombing of the liberation zones in the provinces of Xayabury, Sam Neua, and Xieng Khouang, causing serious losses to the lives and property of the people in the liberation zones.

The commentary pointed out that the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys show the enemy's extreme madness and savagery. U.S. imperialism is trying to use bombing to reverse its heavy losses in the dry season, to boost the morale of the rightist Lao army, which has been beaten to a pulp, and to realize its evil purpose of launching new military adventures in the rainy season. The commentary said that U.S. imperialism is the most stupid. It thinks that guns, bullets, and modern weapons can intimidate the Lao people. However, the fighting spirit of the Lao people has not only not weakened but has grown stronger. Especially in recent years, in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys' special warfare, they have dealt the enemy heavy blows, annihilated tens of thousands of enemies, and shot down more than 800 enemy planes. Under the enemy's savage bombing, production and construction in the liberation zones have never stopped. The more U.S. imperialism intensifies its bombing, the more production rises. This is a serious warning to U.S. imperialism: your planes and cannons cannot intimidate the heroic Lao people.

The commentary said that U.S. imperialism's dispatch of planes to savagely bomb the Lao people has exposed the ugly face of Souvanna Phouma's treachery and harm to the nation. Souvanna Phouma must take responsibility for Lao history and the Lao people.

The commentary finally called on Lao patriotic military personnel and civilians to continue to press forward bravely, annihilate more enemies, and shoot down more enemy planes.

    巴特寮电台强烈抗议美帝野蛮轰炸老挝解放区
    号召爱国军民奋勇前进击落更多敌机
    新华社康开电　巴特寮电台最近发表评论，强烈抗议美国空中强盗最近野蛮轰炸老挝解放区，并号召老挝爱国军民奋勇前进，歼灭更多的敌人，击落更多的敌机。
    评论说，最近以来，美国强盗飞机对沙耶武里、桑怒、川圹等省解放区的人民进行了极其野蛮的狂轰滥炸，使解放区人民的生命财产受到严重损失。
    评论指出，美帝国主义及其走狗的滔天罪行，说明了敌人的极度疯狂和野蛮。美帝国主义企图用轰炸来挽救它们在旱季的惨重失败，为被打得失魂落魄的老挝右派军队鼓气，以便实现它们在雨季进行新的军事冒险的罪恶目的。评论说，美帝国主义是最愚蠢的。它们以为枪炮、子弹、现代化武器可以吓倒老挝人民。然而，老挝人民的战斗意志不但没有削弱，相反越战越勇。特别是最近几年在反击美帝国主义及其走狗的特种战争中，给了敌人沉重的打击，歼敌数万人，击落敌机八百多架。在敌人狂轰滥炸的情况下，解放区的生产建设从来没有停顿过。美帝国主义越是在哪里加紧轰炸，那里的生产就越上升。这是对美帝国主义的严重警告：你们的飞机大炮吓不倒英雄的老挝人民。
    评论说，美帝国主义派遣飞机野蛮轰炸老挝人民，暴露了富马卖国殃民的丑恶嘴脸，富马必须对老挝的历史和老挝人民承担责任。
    评论最后号召老挝爱国军民继续奋勇前进，歼灭更多的敌人，击落更多的敌机。
