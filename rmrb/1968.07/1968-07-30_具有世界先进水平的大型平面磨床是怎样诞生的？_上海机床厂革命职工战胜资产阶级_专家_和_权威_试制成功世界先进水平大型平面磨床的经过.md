The revolutionary workers and revolutionary technical personnel of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carried forward the spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. They broke the expert line, adhered to the revolutionary mass line, and implemented the "three-in-one combination" of revolutionary workers, revolutionary technical personnel, and revolutionary leading cadres. They successfully developed another large flat grinding machine of world advanced level, filling a gap in China's large flat grinding machines and writing a new page in the history of China's grinding machine production.

This large flat grinding machine was born in the fierce struggle between the two lines. This is a brilliant victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a brilliant victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

In 1954, some "experts" in this factory spent two whole years copying foreign design drawings to produce a flat grinding machine. This machine had a complex structure and poor performance, frequently malfunctioning, and could not be used continuously. However, the rapidly developing industrial production in China urgently needed this type of machine. Users and production workers in the factory had long demanded improvements. However, for more than ten years, no improvements were made, resulting in this product being listed as a "reject" for a long time.

In 1966, the state decided to suspend production of this item for one year for key rectification to improve quality. Regarding the state's decision, two opposing views emerged within the factory. Revolutionary workers and revolutionary technical personnel followed Chairman Mao's great teachings, "The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." They firmly advocated breaking the foreign framework and taking the Chinese path. However, the capitalist roaders and a group of bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" in the factory knelt down before the foreigners, only knowing how to crawl and not daring to leap forward. They completely ignored the needs of the state, opposed reforms, and believed that if changes were to be made, only minor changes could be made, even claiming that "minor changes are greatly beneficial."

At that time, technical power was in the hands of bourgeois reactionary "experts" and "authorities." For a long time, they had monopolized technology, suppressed the masses' creativity, and practiced bourgeois dictatorship. However, the revolutionary workers and revolutionary technical personnel did not surrender. They seriously studied the "Three Articles," drew inspiration from Chairman Mao's brilliant works, and increased their courage to overcome difficulties. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings, "No investigation, no right to speak," and voluntarily connected with the management department, technical department, and production workshops to form a three-in-one combination user visit team. They went out of the factory to conduct investigations and research. They widely listened to the opinions of workers, technical personnel, and leaders in user factories, obtaining a large amount of first-hand information. After returning to the factory, they discussed with the factory's production workers and maintenance workers; then, they submitted to the factory leadership a very convincing design task book for large flat grinding machines, along with the opinions collected during the user visits. This was a blow to the bourgeois "authorities." Those "authority" lords considered the masses' revolutionary suggestions to be "rebellion," so they used their stolen authority to organize forces to attack the revolutionary masses. They convened a design scheme review meeting, gathering all the "experts" and "authorities" in the factory, attempting to pressure those who dared to rebel. Before this meeting, the comrades who participated in the three-in-one combination user visit team also held a meeting. They seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, seriously prepared for the struggle, and engaged in a face-to-face struggle with the "authorities" and "experts" at the meeting.

The struggle at the scheme review meeting was intense. The bourgeois lords openly threatened, "You can make major changes if you want, but there will be no trial production process, either batch production or nothing. Do you dare?" "Dare!" The revolutionary masses retaliated. Such a large machine without trial production and directly entering batch production had never been seen before. However, they were determined to fight to the end with these bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" and fight for the proletariat's dignity. After the meeting, they immediately began the design work.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was in full swing. Revolutionary workers and revolutionary technical personnel were even more spirited and enthusiastic, working day and night. Revolutionary technical personnel moved the design room into the workshop, making the workshop the battlefield, with design drawings hanging everywhere. Revolutionary workers and revolutionary technical personnel discussed and modified the design drawings together. If the scheme was not good, they would start over, once, twice, three times, until everyone was satisfied. Here, the old framework of "experts make the law, workers follow the law" was completely broken. In just three months, they completed the design task that previously took half a year to complete.

Despite the capitalist roaders and bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" in this factory using one trick after another to obstruct the production of large flat grinding machines, as the great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the formulation of the "Sixteen Points" pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country." After the "January Revolution," the capitalist roaders and bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" in this factory were overthrown. The broad revolutionary workers and revolutionary technical personnel further unleashed their long-suppressed enthusiasm and creativity. They enthusiastically launched the trial production of large flat grinding machines at the beginning of this year. Revolutionary workers, revolutionary technical personnel, and revolutionary leading cadres formed a "three-in-one combination" combat team. Revolutionary leading cadres went deep into the trial production site, revolutionary technical personnel participated in actual operations, and they, as ordinary laborers, discussed and modified schemes with the workers, solving difficulties together. Revolutionary workers have the deepest proletarian feelings and the richest practical experience. During the trial production, they proposed a large number of modification opinions for the design scheme, making the design of this machine more perfect. With their boundless wisdom, they solved a series of difficult problems in the trial production process.

During the trial production, the broad revolutionary workers and revolutionary technical personnel brought the capitalist roaders and bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" in the factory to the trial production site for face-to-face struggles. They severely criticized the revisionist goods such as technocracy, expert management, slavishness, betrayal, and crawling promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. At the same time, they exposed the heinous crimes of the capitalist roaders in this factory colluding with bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities," sabotaging technological innovation and technological revolution, practicing technological monopoly, and suppressing workers' enthusiasm and creativity. This further aroused the broad revolutionary masses' hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev and deepened their love for Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The broad revolutionary masses used their sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm to overcome countless difficulties in production and finally successfully trial-produced China's first large flat grinding machine in May. They used this fruitful result brought by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to give a resounding slap to a handful of capitalist roaders and bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities," greatly dispelling the bourgeois arrogance and greatly boosting the proletarian spirit!

    具有世界先进水平的大型平面磨床是怎样诞生的？
    ——上海机床厂革命职工战胜资产阶级“专家”和“权威”试制成功世界先进水平大型平面磨床的经过
    上海机床厂的革命工人和革命技术人员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干的革命精神，大破专家路线，坚持革命的群众路线，实行革命工人、革命技术人员、革命领导干部“三结合”，又试制成功了一台达到世界先进水平的大型平面磨床，填补了我国大型平面磨床的一个缺口，为我国磨床生产史写下了新的一页。
    这种大型平面磨床，是在两条路线的激烈斗争中诞生的。这是毛泽东思想的光辉胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的光辉胜利！
    一九五四年，这个厂的一些“专家”，花了整整两年的时间，完全照搬外国的设计图纸，仿制了一台平面磨床。这台机床结构复杂，性能极差，老是发生故障，不能持续使用。可是，迅速发展的我国工业生产却十分需要这种机床，用户厂和本厂生产工人早就要求改进设计。然而，十来年却始终没有作任何改进，结果只能让这项产品长期列入“等外品”。
    一九六六年，国家决定这项产品停产一年，进行重点整顿，以提高质量。对于国家的这一决定，厂里出现了两种针锋相对的意见。革命的工人和革命的技术人员遵循毛主席“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”的伟大教导，坚决主张打破洋框框，走中国自己的路。可是，这个厂的走资派和一批资产阶级反动技术“权威”，却跪倒在洋人脚下，只会爬行，不敢跃进。他们完全不顾国家的需要，反对改革，认为如果要改，也只能作些小改，还美其名是什么“小改大有利”。
    当时技术大权掌握在资产阶级反动“专家”、“权威”手里。长期以来，他们实行技术垄断，扼杀群众创造，实行资产阶级专政。但是革命的工人和革命的技术人员并没有屈服，他们认真学习了“老三篇”，从毛主席的光辉著作中受到鼓舞，提高了克服困难的勇气。他们按照毛主席“没有调查就没有发言权”的教导，自动在管理部门、技术部门、生产车间进行串连，组成一个三结合的用户访问小组，走出厂门，进行调查研究。他们广泛听取了用户厂的工人、技术人员和领导人员的意见，获得了大量的第一手资料。回厂后，他们又和本厂的生产工人、检修工人进行讨论；然后，他们向厂领导提出了一份十分有说服力的大型平面磨床设计任务书，并且附上了访问用户时所征求来的意见。这是对那些资产阶级“权威”老爷的当头一棒。那班“权威”老爷们认为群众的这种革命建议简直是“犯上作乱”，于是，他们利用窃取的职权，摆起“权威”的架势，组织力量向革命群众进行围攻。他们召开了什么设计方案审查会，集中了全厂的“专家”、“权威”，企图向敢于革命的同志施加压力。在这个会议之前，参加三结合用户访问组的同志也开了会。他们认真学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，认真作了斗争前的准备，在会上和“权威”、“专家”展开了针锋相对的斗争。
    在方案审查会上，斗争十分激烈。资产阶级老爷们公然威胁说：“你们一定要大改也可以，但不准有试制过程，要么就成批投产。你们敢不敢？”“敢！”革命群众针锋相对地进行反击。这样的大型机床不经过试制就成批投产的事，还从未见过。但是他们决心要和这些资产阶级反动技术“权威”斗争到底，要为无产阶级争这口气。会后，他们立即开始了设计工作。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。革命工人、革命技术人员更是精神振奋，干劲倍增，日夜奋战。革命技术人员把设计室搬进车间，车间成了战场，到处挂满了设计图。革命工人、革命技术人员共同讨论、修改设计图纸。方案不行，就推翻重来，一次、二次、三次，直到大家满意为止。在这里，完全打破了从前那种“专家立法，工人守法”的旧框框。仅仅三个月的时间，他们就完成了过去半年也无法完成的设计任务。
    尽管这个厂的走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”施出一个又一个阴谋诡计，企图阻挠大型平面磨床的制造，但是正如伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”中指出的：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”“一月革命”以后，这个厂的走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”被赶下了台。广大革命工人和革命技术人员往日被压抑的积极性和创造性，进一步得到发挥。他们满怀豪情地让大型平面磨床的试制工作，在今年年初跃上了马。由革命工人、革命技术人员、革命领导干部组成了“三结合”战斗组。革命领导干部深入试制现场，革命技术人员参加实际操作，他们以一个普通劳动者的身份和工人在一起，共同讨论修改方案，共同解决困难问题。革命工人的无产阶级感情最深，实践经验最丰富。在试制过程中，他们对设计方案又提出了大量修改意见，使这台机床的设计更加完善，而且又以他们无比的聪明才智，解决了试制过程中一系列的疑难问题。
    在试制的过程中，广大革命工人、革命技术人员，把厂里的走资派、资产阶级反动技术“权威”揪到试制现场，进行面对面的斗争。他们狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的技术第一、专家治厂、奴隶主义、卖国主义、爬行主义等修正主义黑货，同时揭发了这个厂的走资派勾结资产阶级反动技术“权威”，破坏技术革新和技术革命，实行技术垄断，扼杀工人积极性和创造性的滔天罪行。这就更激起了广大革命群众对中国赫鲁晓夫的仇恨，更加深了他们对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的热爱。广大革命群众把冲天的革命干劲用到生产上，克服了无数困难，终于在今年五月试制成功了我国第一台大型平面磨床。他们以无产阶级文化大革命带来的这个丰硕成果，给了一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”一记响亮耳光，大灭了资产阶级的威风，大长了无产阶级的志气！
