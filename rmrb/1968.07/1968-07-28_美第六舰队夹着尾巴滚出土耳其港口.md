In the midst of the Turkish people's cries of "beat them" and "get out," the U.S. Sixth Fleet slinks out of Turkish ports with its tail between its legs.

In the past ten days, the Turkish people have unleashed a surging anti-American tide. They have demonstrated and protested against the visit of U.S. warships, beaten up American sailors who came ashore, smashed American aggression institutions, and bravely resisted police suppression, causing the reactionary authorities to panic.

New China News Agency, July 26th: Istanbul, Turkey - The five warships of the U.S. Sixth Fleet that recently arrived in Turkish ports for a "visit" have already slunk away on the 24th, under the roar of the Turkish people shouting "get out."

The American sailors on these warships were supposed to "rest" in Turkish ports for ten days, but the Turkish people "welcomed" them with fists and shouts of "get out."

In the first few days of July 15th, when this batch of American sailors appeared in the ports of Istanbul and Izmir, they were met with fierce beatings by the enraged Turkish people. People threw stones, eggs, ink, and paint at them, and even threw some American sailors into the sea. The vehicles provided for the American sailors to "tour" were also smashed by the crowd.

American soldiers who sneaked into the Turkish capital Ankara also got beaten up. Among them, an American colonel was surrounded and beaten by the crowd on a street in Ankara, sustaining serious injuries.

The Turkish people not only beat up the American sailors who came ashore but also attacked American aggression institutions scattered throughout the Turkish capital, such as the "International Development Agency," the American News Agency, Pan American Airlines, and the Turkish-American Bank. They smashed the large glass windows and windows of these institutions with stones. The crowd also pasted anti-American slogans on American cars.

Massive anti-American patriotic demonstrations erupted in Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir, and Trabzon. The slogans held high by the demonstrators read: "Get out, you annoying Americans!" "Sixth Fleet, get out!"

Faced with the powerful anti-American demonstrations of the Turkish people, the U.S. Embassy in Turkey hurriedly announced "strict restrictions" on American sailors coming ashore and ordered the Turkish government to "protect" the American sailors who came ashore.

The reactionary Turkish authorities, who are subservient to American imperialism, dispatched large numbers of military police to brutally suppress the patriotic crowds holding anti-American demonstrations. According to incomplete statistics, in the nearly ten days of suppression by the military police, a large number of demonstrators were injured, and more than a hundred people were arrested, with more than eighty people arrested in Istanbul alone.

The reactionary authorities also announced that they would "prosecute" patriotic crowds who held anti-American demonstrations "without permission" outside the American radar station in Trabzon. Moreover, the Turkish authorities used every means to incite thugs to disrupt the patriotic anti-American actions of the people. On the day the American warships were forced to leave, the patriotic crowds in Konya, central Turkey, were originally scheduled to hold an anti-American demonstration to protest the stationing of a large number of American troops in Turkey. The reactionary authorities then directed a large number of thugs armed with sticks and stones to attack patriotic crowds on the streets, ransack the offices, bookstores, and libraries of progressive student and teacher organizations, and destroy the printing presses of newspapers that printed anti-American leaflets. When patriotic students and teachers fought back in self-defense, the authorities then sent in military police for savage suppression, beating and arresting patriotic crowds, and disrupting anti-American demonstration marches.

The Turkish people are extremely angry that the reactionary authorities are acting as American imperialism's running dogs. On the 24th, after learning that a law student who was severely beaten by the police during an anti-American demonstration the previous week had died in the hospital, students in Istanbul took to the streets again to demonstrate and angrily protest the authorities' atrocities. Two thousand five hundred students, holding placards, rushed to the city police headquarters, demanding severe punishment for the culprits. A large number of police, wearing helmets and wielding batons, brazenly attacked the demonstrating students, injuring and arresting dozens of students. The students fought back with stones.

On the 25th, even more students angrily took to the streets of Istanbul to protest the new atrocities of the reactionary authorities. Five thousand students charged towards the city hall. A large number of police and gendarmes again attacked the demonstrating students and carried out suppression. The students bravely fought back with stones, injuring some police.

That evening, Turkish Defense Minister Topaloglu rushed to Istanbul and held an emergency meeting with the local army commander and police chief to plot further suppression of the patriotic students. The military also quickly deployed to various strategic locations in the city.

It is announced that in the face of the surging anti-American tide at home, Turkish President Sunay will preside over a so-called National Security Committee meeting on the 27th to plot emergency measures.

    在土耳其人民的一片喊打喊“滚”声中
    美第六舰队夹着尾巴滚出土耳其港口
    近十天中，土耳其人民掀起了汹涌的反美怒涛，他们示威抗议美舰“访问”，狠揍上岸的美国水兵，怒砸美国侵略机构，英勇反击警察镇压，使反动当局极度恐慌
    新华社二十六日讯伊斯坦布尔消息：最近开到土耳其港口“访问”的美国第六舰队的五艘军舰，在土耳其人民发出的一片“滚走”的怒吼声中，已经在二十四日灰溜溜地开走了。
    这些军舰上的美国水兵，原来是要到土耳其港口“休息”十天，但土耳其人民“接待”他们的是拳头和“滚走”的吼声。
    在七月十五日开头的几天，当这批美国水兵在伊斯坦布尔和伊兹密尔港口露面时，就遭到愤怒的土耳其人民的迎头痛打，人们向他们扔石头、鸡蛋，泼墨水、油漆，甚至把一些美国水兵扔到海里去。供美国水兵“游览”的车辆也被群众砸了。
    溜到土耳其首都安卡拉的美国官兵，也挨了揍。其中有一名美国上校，在安卡拉大街上被群众围住痛打一顿，身受重伤。
    土耳其人民不仅狠揍那些上岸活动的美国水兵，还对遍布土耳其首都的美国侵略机构，如“国际开发署”、美国新闻处、泛美航空公司、土美银行等，进行袭击。他们用石头砸碎了这些机构的大玻璃橱窗和窗户。群众还在美国佬的汽车上，贴上了反对美帝的口号。
    在安卡拉、伊斯坦布尔、伊兹密尔、特拉布松，到处爆发大规模的反美爱国示威。示威群众高举的标语牌上写着：“讨厌的美国佬，滚回去！”“第六舰队，滚蛋！”
    在土耳其人民的强大反美示威面前，美国驻土耳其大使馆慌忙宣布“严格限制”美国水兵上岸，并命令土耳其政府对上岸的美国水兵加以“保护”。
    对美帝国主义唯命是从的土耳其当局，出动大批军警，对举行反美示威的爱国群众进行残酷的镇压。据不完全统计，在军警近十天的镇压中，有大批示威群众被打伤，有一百多人被捕，其中仅伊斯坦布尔一地就有八十多人。
    反动当局还宣布要对
  “未经许可”就到特拉布松的美国雷达站外面举行反美示威的爱国群众进行
  “起诉”。不仅如此，土耳其当局还千方百计地利用暴徒，破坏群众的反美爱国行动。在美国军舰被迫开走的当天，土耳其中部科尼亚市的爱国群众原定要举行反美示威，抗议大批美国军队在土耳其驻扎。反动当局就指使大批暴徒，拿着木棍和石块在大街上袭击爱国群众，洗劫进步学生和教师组织的办公室、书店、图书馆，捣毁承印反美传单的报馆。当爱国师生进行自卫反击时，当局就乘机出动军警进行野蛮镇压，殴打并逮捕爱国群众，破坏反美示威游行。
    土耳其人民对反动当局甘当美帝国主义的帮凶极为愤怒。二十四日，伊斯坦布尔学生获悉上星期在反美示威中被警察毒打重伤的一名法律系学生在医院里死去的消息后，他们就又上街示威，愤怒抗议当局的暴行。二千五百名学生举着标语牌，涌到市警察总局，要求严惩凶手。头戴钢盔、手舞警棍的大批警察悍然向示威学生发动攻击，打伤和逮捕数十名学生。学生们用石头与警察进行了搏斗。
    二十五日，更多的学生愤怒涌上伊斯坦布尔的街头，抗议反动当局的新暴行。有五千名学生冲向市政厅。大批警察和宪兵又向示威学生发动袭击，进行镇压。学生们英勇地用石头进行反击，打伤一些警察。
    当天晚上，土耳其国防部长托帕洛格卢赶到伊斯坦布尔，同当地的陆军司令和警察头子连夜开会，策划对爱国学生的进一步镇压。军队也连夜开入市区的各个战略地点布防。
    据宣布，面对国内人民高涨的反美浪潮，土耳其总统苏奈定于二十七日主持所谓国家安全委员会会议，密谋应急措施。
