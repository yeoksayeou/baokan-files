Last March, I was elected as a representative of the revolutionary masses to join the revolutionary committee. Initially, I thought that since the revolutionary masses had elected me to the revolutionary committee, any opinions and demands from the masses should be accepted and resolved. Once, some workers from a workshop came to me regarding welfare benefits, asking me to reflect their demands. When faced with such a problem, I was at a loss. Should I support their demands? Their demands were clearly unreasonable. Should I not support them? They would have complaints against me. I brought this problem to study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "Serve the people wholeheartedly, never leave the masses; act in the interests of the people, not in the interests of individuals or small groups; the unity of being responsible to the people and being responsible to the Party's leadership; these are our starting points." With the attitude of being responsible to the people, I conducted thorough investigations and research, and believed that their demands were unreasonable. They only considered their immediate interests, forgetting the long-term and fundamental interests of the working class. I thought, as a representative of the revolutionary masses, I should represent the fundamental interests of the revolutionary masses. The working class has deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, has a high level of class consciousness, and is "the most far-sighted, selfless, and most thorough in revolution." The demands of these people do not conform to the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of workers who are selfless. If I listened to a few opinions and thought they were the opinions of the broad masses, in the long run, I would become detached from the masses and lose my representativeness. Therefore, I could not support these opinions from these masses, and I must firmly use Mao Zedong Thought to educate the masses. I told them: "I will support and represent what is in line with Mao Zedong Thought; I will not support and even oppose what is not in line with Mao Zedong Thought." Then, I went with other members of the revolutionary committee to these workers, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, doing detailed ideological work; at the same time, deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, conducting bitter-sweet education, and finally making them aware. For those who stirred up trouble behind these masses, we, together with the masses, criticized and struggled against them. At this time, some comrades said to me: "The immediate interests of the working class should serve the long-term interests. At that time, fortunately, you did not support this 'demand,' otherwise, you would have fallen into the trap of the class enemy." Through this incident, I further understood that only by arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, educating the masses, and continuously raising the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of workers, leading the broad masses of workers to launch an attack on the class enemy, can the revolutionary masses consciously distinguish between immediate interests and long-term interests, right and wrong. In this way, the fundamental interests of the masses can be represented, and the revolutionary committee can always maintain a vigorous fighting force, becoming a vigorous fighting command post.

    要代表革命群众的根本利益
    沈阳冶炼厂革命委员会副主任　杨昌鉴
    去年三月，我作为革命群众代表被选进了革命委员会。起初我想，革命群众把自己选进了革命委员会，凡是来自群众的意见、要求，就要接受，就要想法解决。有一次，一个车间的部分工人因为福利待遇问题来找我，要我反映他们的要求。遇到了这样的问题，我一时不知如何是好。支持他们的要求吧，他们的要求明明不合理；不支持吧，他们会对我有意见。我带着这个问题，学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发；向人民负责和向党的领导机关负责的一致性；这些就是我们的出发点。”我抱着向人民负责的态度，又作了深入细致的调查研究，认为他们的这种要求是不合理的。他们只顾及到自己的眼前利益，忘记了工人阶级的长远利益和根本利益。我想，作为革命群众代表，就是要代表革命群众的根本利益。工人阶级对伟大领袖毛主席有着深厚的无产阶级感情，有很高的阶级觉悟，他们“最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”而这一部分人提出的要求，是不符合广大工人群众大公无私的革命精神的。如果我听到一点意见，就以为是广大群众的意见，长久下去，就会使自己脱离群众，失去代表性。因此，对这部分群众的意见，我不能支持，而且要坚决用毛泽东思想教育群众。于是，我对他们说：“符合毛泽东思想的我就支持，就代表；不符合毛泽东思想的，我就不支持，而且还要反对。”接着，我便和革命委员会其他成员一起深入到这部分工人群众中去，以毛泽东思想为武器，作细致的思想工作；同时，深入地开展革命大批判，进行忆苦思甜教育，终于使他们觉悟过来。对于在这一部分群众背后煽风点火的坏家伙，我们和群众一起对他进行了批判、斗争。这时，有些群众对我说：“工人阶级的眼前利益要服从长远利益。那阵子，幸亏你没有支持这个‘要求’，不然就上了阶级敌人的当。”通过这件事，使我进一步懂得了，只有用毛泽东思想武装群众，教育群众，不断提高广大工人群众的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，带领广大工人群众向阶级敌人发动进攻，革命群众才能自觉地分清那些是眼前利益，那些是长远利益，那些是对的，那些是错的。这样，才能从根本上代表群众的利益，使革命委员会永远保持旺盛的战斗力量，成为朝气蓬勃的战斗指挥部。
