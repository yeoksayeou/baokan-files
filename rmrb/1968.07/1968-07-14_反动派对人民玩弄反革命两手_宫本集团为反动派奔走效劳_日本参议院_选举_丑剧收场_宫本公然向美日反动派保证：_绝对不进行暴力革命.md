The farce of the Japanese House of Councillors "election" ended on the 9th. The reactionary nature of the Japanese reactionaries in implementing fascist rule over the Japanese people and the Japanese Communist Party Miyamoto revisionist group's service to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries was once again fully exposed in this "election" activity.

This "election" was held under the circumstances where the Sato government's domestic and foreign policies, which are pro-American, are encountering increasing difficulties, and class contradictions and class struggles in Japanese society are becoming increasingly sharp. Before the House of Councillors "election," the Japanese people launched a powerful struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," against the U.S. military bases in Japan, against the revival of Japanese militarism, and against the Sato government's anti-China policies from June 23rd. These struggles powerfully exposed the Sato government's crimes as a running dog of U.S. imperialism and dealt a heavy blow to the aggressive and war policies of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

To maintain its reactionary rule, the Sato government carried out frenzied suppression of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic movement during the "election" process. It dispatched tens of thousands of armed police to beat and arrest patriotic workers and young students, and did everything possible to suppress public opinion and manipulate the "election."

At the same time, intimidated by the vigorous development of the Japanese people's anti-American movement, U.S. imperialism attempted to use some small tricks to "alleviate" the Japanese people's anti-American sentiment. Before the voting, it staged a farce of the United States "returning" the Bonin Islands to Japan, helping the Sato government to deceive voters in the House of Councillors "election."

While suppressing and deceiving the Japanese people, the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries also used the Japanese Communist Party Miyamoto revisionist group to sabotage the struggles of the Japanese people. The Miyamoto group, through bourgeois television and radio, spared no effort to serve the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. They launched vicious attacks against the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic movement, beautifying U.S. imperialism. They openly advocated that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" could be "legally" "abolished" by submitting a "notification" to the U.S. government, claiming that this was "a non-violent and most realistic way to achieve independence." Miyamoto Shigeo himself also took to the field, servilely assuring the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries: "The Japanese Communist Party (Miyamoto revisionist group) will absolutely not carry out a violent revolution."

However, the various evil deeds of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the Miyamoto revisionist group cannot stop the increasingly awakened Japanese people from advancing. The Japanese people are pushing their anti-American patriotic struggle to new heights.

    反动派对人民玩弄反革命两手　宫本集团为反动派奔走效劳
    日本参议院“选举”丑剧收场
    宫本公然向美日反动派保证：“绝对不进行暴力革命”
    新华社讯　东京消息：日本每三年一次的参议院“选举”丑剧已在九日收场。日本反动派对日本人民实行法西斯统治和日共宫本修正主义集团为美日反动派效劳的反动本质，在这次“选举”活动中再一次暴露无遗。
    这次“选举”是在亲美的佐藤政府的内外政策遭到越来越大的困难，日本社会的阶级矛盾和阶级斗争越来越尖锐的情况下进行的。在参议院“选举”之前，日本人民从六月二十三日掀起了反对日美“安全条约”、反对驻日美军基地、反对复活日本军国主义、反对佐藤政府反华的声势浩大的斗争。这些斗争，有力地揭露了佐藤政府充当美帝走狗的罪行，沉重地打击了美日反动派的侵略政策和战争政策。
    佐藤政府为了维持它的反动统治，在“选举”过程中，对日本人民的反美爱国运动进行了疯狂的镇压。它派出了数以千计的武装警察殴打和逮捕爱国工人和青年学生，千方百计地压制舆论和操纵“选举”。
    同时，慑于日本人民反美运动的蓬勃发展，美帝国主义妄想使用一些小动作来“缓和”日本人民的反美情绪，在投票之前，表演了一幕美国把小笠原群岛“归还”给日本的闹剧，帮助佐藤政府在参议院“选举”中骗取选票。
    美日反动派在镇压和欺骗日本人民的同时，还利用日共宫本修正主义集团来破坏日本人民的斗争。宫本集团通过资产阶级的电视和广播，竭力为美日反动派效劳。他们大放反华厥词，恶毒地攻击日本人民的反美爱国运动，美化美帝国主义。他们公然鼓吹日美“安全条约”可以用向美国政府提出“通告”的方法“合法”地“废除”，说这是“为了达到独立目的的不过激和最现实的道路”。宫本显治本人也赤膊上阵，奴颜婢膝地向美日反动派保证：“日共（宫本修正主义集团）绝对不进行暴力革命”。
    但是，美日反动派和宫本修正主义集团的种种罪恶行径，都阻止不了日益觉醒的日本人民的前进。日本人民正在把他们的反美爱国斗争推向新的高潮。
