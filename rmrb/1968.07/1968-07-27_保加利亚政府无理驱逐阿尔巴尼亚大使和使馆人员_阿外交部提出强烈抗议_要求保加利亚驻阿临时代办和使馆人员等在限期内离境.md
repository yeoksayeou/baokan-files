The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Albania issued a statement on July 23, strongly protesting the Bulgarian government's unreasonable announcement on July 22 to expel Albanian Ambassador to Sofia, Baliri, and four Albanian diplomatic and technical officials, as well as an Albanian News Agency correspondent, ordering them to leave Bulgaria within three days.

The statement said that the Bulgarian government fabricated charges against Ambassador Baliri and the Albanian Embassy staff in Sofia to achieve its clear hostile purpose: to oppose the friendship between the Albanian people and the Bulgarian people, to damage the national relations between the two countries, and to oppose the steadfast fighter of Marxism-Leninism, the consistent fighter against imperialism and its accomplices, the modern revisionists, the People's Republic of Albania.

The statement pointed out that the Embassy of the People's Republic of Albania in Sofia, in accordance with the correct principled policy of the Albanian government, has always striven in all its activities to maintain and promote the friendship between the two peoples and to maintain normal national relations between the two countries. It fully complies with the existing laws of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and has never interfered in its internal affairs. The Bulgarian government's groundless claim that the Albanian Embassy has engaged in so-called hostile activities, even claiming that it has incited activities harmful to the security of the Bulgarian government, is a despicable slander. This is a plot by the current Bulgarian leadership, which urgently needs such distractions and provocations to divert the attention of the Bulgarian people from the continuous failures and serious situation of the Bulgarian leadership, which is the result of the Bulgarian leadership's faithful implementation of the betrayal line of the Soviet revisionist leadership.

The statement pointed out that the actions of the Bulgarian government are part of its entire hostile policy towards socialist Albania.

The statement pointed out that the Embassy of the People's Republic of Bulgaria in Tirana, contrary to its diplomatic functions, has been openly conducting hostile activities against the People's Republic of Albania and the friendship between the two peoples. It has also been trying in every way to propagate the revisionist line of its leadership in Tirana, although this is in vain. In this regard, we can mention the example of the former Bulgarian Chargé d'Affaires, Nanko Berev, who shamelessly made vile provocative slanders against the good-neighbor policy of the People's Republic of Albania. The current Chargé d'Affaires of the People's Republic of Bulgaria in Tirana, Karadimov, and the entire staff of the Bulgarian Embassy have also engaged in similar hostile activities.

The statement said: For the above reasons, as a countermeasure, the government of the People's Republic of Albania demands that the Bulgarian Chargé d'Affaires, Karadimov, and six other embassy staff members and a Bulgarian News Agency correspondent leave the country by July 24, 1968.

The statement concluded by saying: The Albanian government once again firmly rejects all groundless accusations and fabricated slanders against the Albanian Embassy in Sofia, strongly opposes the latest hostile action taken by the Bulgarian government against the Albanian ambassador and embassy staff, and the Bulgarian government must bear serious responsibility for all the consequences of its actions against the People's Republic of Albania.

    保加利亚政府无理驱逐阿尔巴尼亚大使和使馆人员
    阿外交部提出强烈抗议
    要求保加利亚驻阿临时代办和使馆人员等在限期内离境
    新华社地拉那二十六日电　阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国外交部二十三日发表声明，强烈抗议保加利亚政府七月二十二日无理宣布驱逐阿尔巴尼亚驻索非亚大使巴利里和四名阿尔巴尼亚外交和技术官员以及阿尔巴尼亚通讯社记者，并要他们在三天内离开保加利亚。
    声明说，保加利亚政府给巴利里大使和阿尔巴尼亚驻索非亚大使馆人员捏造罪名，以达到其明确的敌意的目的：反对阿尔巴尼亚人民同保加利亚人民的友谊，损害两国的国家关系和反对无畏的马克思列宁主义旗手、反对反帝国主义及其勾结者现代修正主义者的始终如一的战士阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国。
    声明指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国驻索非亚大使馆遵照阿尔巴尼亚政府正确的原则性的政策，在自己的全部活动中一向为维护和促进两国人民的友谊，为保持两国正常的国家关系而努力，它完全遵守保加利亚人民共和国的现行法规，从来不干涉其内政。保加利亚政府毫无根据地说阿尔巴尼亚大使馆进行了所谓的敌视活动，甚至说什么进行了危害保加利亚政府安全的煽动，这种无稽之谈是一种卑鄙的诽谤，是在保加利亚现领导迫切需要这种牵制挑衅以转移保加利亚人民对保加利亚连续失败和严重局势的注意的时候策划的，而这种失败和严重局势是保加利亚现领导忠实推行苏联修正主义领导的背叛路线的结果。
    声明指出，保加利亚政府的这些行动是它对社会主义阿尔巴尼亚采取的整个敌对政策的一部分。
    声明指出，保加利亚驻地拉那大使馆同它的外交职能完全相反，它不断地对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国和两国人民的友谊进行公开的敌对活动，它还千方百计地在地拉那宣传它的领导人的修正主义路线，虽然这是徒劳的。在这方面，我们可以提一提前保加利亚临时代办南科·贝列夫的事例，他非常无耻地对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的睦邻政策进行卑鄙的挑衅性诬蔑。现任保加利亚人民共和国驻地拉那临时代办卡拉迪莫夫以及保加利亚大使馆的全体人员也进行了同样敌对活动。
    声明说：由于上述原因，作为一种反措施，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府要求保加利亚临时代办卡拉迪莫夫及其他六名使馆人员和保加利亚通讯社记者在一九六八年七月二十四日这一天内离境。
    声明最后说：阿尔巴尼亚政府再次坚决拒绝对阿尔巴尼亚驻索非亚大使馆提出的一切毫无根据的指责和捏造的诬蔑，强烈反对保加利亚政府对阿尔巴尼亚大使和大使馆人员所采取的又一敌对行动，保加利亚政府必须对它自己反对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的活动所产生的一切后果负严重的责任。
