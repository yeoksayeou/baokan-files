Editor's Note: Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on "streamlining administration and reducing personnel," has dismantled redundant administrative structures and taken a significant step towards forming a revolutionary leadership team that is closely connected with the masses, setting a new revolutionary style.

Revolutionizing the leadership team, reducing the number of personnel, and going to the front lines are important conditions for revolutionary committees to closely connect with the masses. This is of great significance for implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, carrying out class struggle, thwarting the attempts of class enemies to restore capitalism, overcoming bureaucratic habits, promoting the great alliance of revolutionary mass organizations, and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Implementing streamlining administration and reducing personnel is a sharp and profound class struggle. The new revolutionary organs are in sharp contradiction with the old ideas and styles of the exploiting classes. A handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, as well as old habits and forces, will inevitably interfere with and attack the newly established revolutionary committees from various angles. The new revolutionary committees must bravely break away from the old organizational frameworks. They must take a firm stand, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Liu Shaoqi in the construction of state power, criticize conservatism, and break through the resistance of the old forces of the exploiting classes.

All levels of revolutionary committees and central working departments should, like Lingbao County, seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, do a good job in cleaning up class ranks, and take the path of "streamlining administration and reducing personnel." If most revolutionary committees can handle the two tasks of cleaning up class ranks and implementing streamlining administration and reducing personnel well, it will be a consolidation and development of the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution in terms of organization.

According to a report from the People's Daily, following the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary committees, Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee in Henan Province has continuously summarized experiences and lessons in the struggle, streamlined administration and improved work style, striving to "organize a revolutionary and mass-connected leadership team," further enhancing the power of the revolutionary government.

After its establishment on January 3 this year, Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee conducted multiple studies on the organizational construction and institutional setup. Due to the constraints of old ideas and frameworks, despite repeated revisions, the institutions remained large, establishing "eight groups and two offices": Political Propaganda Group, Organization Group, Rural Group, Internal Affairs Group, Finance and Trade Group, Industry and Commerce Group, Culture and Health Group, Statistics Group, and the Revolutionary Committee Office, Cultural Revolution Office. There were nearly a hundred staff members. Some issues that could be resolved with a single pass were pushed from one group to another, from one cadre to another, causing delays in solving problems, affecting revolution and production, and drawing complaints from the masses. Poor and lower-middle peasants said: "Your work involves too many procedures. After visiting three or four times, the problem is still not resolved. The work of the Revolutionary Committee should be improved."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The basic experience of revolutionary committees is threefold: one is the representation of revolutionary cadres, one is the representation of the army, and one is the representation of revolutionary masses, achieving the three-in-one combination of revolution. Revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down redundant administrative structures, streamline administration and reduce personnel, and organize a revolutionary and mass-connected leadership team." Members of Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee seriously studied this brilliant instruction, reviewed past experiences and lessons, thoroughly investigated the dangers of cumbersome institutions, and discussed the benefits of "streamlining administration and reducing personnel," summarizing the "five harms and five benefits": (1) The harm of cumbersome institutions is detachment from the masses and being high above; the benefit of streamlining administration and reducing personnel is convenience in deepening into the masses and learning from the masses. (2) The harm of cumbersome institutions is idleness and procrastination in work; the benefit of streamlining administration and reducing personnel is a streamlined and powerful organizational structure, conducive to fostering a serious and responsible work style. (3) The harm of cumbersome institutions is fostering officialdom and growing selfishness; the benefit of streamlining administration and reducing personnel is being able to be both an official and a civilian, breaking private interests and establishing public interests. (4) The harm of cumbersome institutions is easy detachment from class struggle and reality; the benefit of streamlining administration and reducing personnel is that cadres can often go through the storms of class struggle, gain experience, and see the world. (5) The harm of cumbersome institutions is easy transformation into a bureaucratic institution, becoming a breeding ground for revisionism, and not conducive to the revolutionization of people's thoughts; the benefit of streamlining administration and reducing personnel is conducive to highlighting proletarian politics, resisting the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, and promoting the revolutionization of people's thoughts. Through study and discussion, everyone agreed: The organizational construction of the Revolutionary Committee must take the path of "streamlining administration and reducing personnel" as indicated by Chairman Mao.

The new organizational structure changed the original "eight groups and two offices" into four groups: Political Work Group, Revolution and Production Command Group, Security Group, and Administrative Group. The number of office staff was reduced from nearly a hundred to thirty (including twelve PLA representatives). The original county committee and county people's committee staff, except for those participating in the Revolutionary Committee's office work, were divided into two parts: one part stayed in the office to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and the other part formed Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, going deep into the countryside and grassroots levels.

After streamlining the organizational structure, how to handle the situation with fewer people and more tasks? They seriously studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "The Working Methods of the Party Committee" and related teachings on the mass line, focusing on two points: First, among numerous tasks, grasp the fundamentals. No matter how busy the work is or how large the tasks are, always prioritize the active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought, ensuring that one group can do the work of several groups and one person can do the work of several people. Leaders trust the masses and work boldly, allowing general issues to be handled by relevant staff of each group, changing the past situation where everything had to be reported to the leaders and only the leaders' words counted. Second, go deep into the masses and follow the mass line, solving a large number of problems at the grassroots level, changing the old style of "more problems at the bottom, more backlogs at the top, conflicts only reported upwards, and not resolved for a long time." The main members of the county Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's instructions of "being both an official and a civilian" and "cadres should go to the lower levels to walk around, see the situation, insist on the mass line, and consult with the masses on matters, being students of the masses," often go deep into the countryside, studying, eating, living, and working with the masses. Wherever the difficulties are great, they go there; wherever the situation is complex, they go there; wherever the work is arduous, they go there. One commune is relatively far from the county seat and has a more complex situation. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, a handful of class enemies blew the wind of rightist reversal, inciting the masses to not follow the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee, obstructing the development of the revolution and work. The main responsible person of the county Revolutionary Committee, carrying Chairman Mao's works, went to this commune, assisting the commune Revolutionary Committee and proletarian revolutionaries in holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, firmly grasping class struggle. They mobilized the masses well, exposed the inside story of the rightist reversal wind, exposed the counter-revolutionary two-faced person, and powerfully educated the masses. The deceived masses turned against the enemy, repelling the attack of the class enemies and further consolidating the Revolutionary Committee. In one commune, the struggle between the two factions was very intense, and the Revolutionary Committee could not be established for a long time. A standing committee member of the county Revolutionary Committee went there with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, studying together with everyone, criticizing and repudiating revisionism. Both sides, based on the principle of "each side doing more self-criticism," checked their own organization's errors, and united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, quickly establishing the Revolutionary Committee.

After streamlining the organizational structure, the work style of the leading cadres also improved. They went deep into each group and grassroots levels, solving problems anytime and anywhere. Wherever they went, they worked there. Sometimes under a tree, sometimes by a canal, sometimes in the office, sometimes on the street, they could discuss and solve problems with visiting masses and colleagues seeking instructions at any time. When handling problems, leading cadres often studied together with the staff. If the leader's opinion did not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, the staff could criticize. Once, a comrade from an external unit needed a letter of introduction for an external investigation. A leading comrade of the county Revolutionary Committee readily agreed and asked the administrative group to write it. However, after inquiry, it did not conform to the superior's instructions on external investigations, so the administrative group refused to issue it and criticized the leader on the spot. The leading comrade thought the criticism was correct and accepted it humbly. He happily said: "As long as there is supervision from comrades, we will make fewer mistakes."

Recently, the members of Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." They decided to follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, trust the broad masses of the people, rely on the broad masses of the people, protect the broad masses of the people, and lead the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses of the entire county to do a good job in cleaning up class ranks, resolutely exposing and overthrowing the traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, thoroughly fighting them down and exposing their stench.

    灵宝县革委会实行领导班子革命化  精兵简政，密切联系群众
    编者按：灵宝县革命委员会，遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“精兵简政”的教导，打破重叠的行政机构，朝着组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子前进了一大步，树立了崭新的革命作风。
    领导班子革命化，办事人员少，走上第一线，这是革命委员会紧密联系群众的一个重要条件，对于贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，开展对敌斗争，粉碎阶级敌人复辟资本主义的企图，克服官僚主义旧习气，促进两派革命群众组织的革命大联合，巩固无产阶级专政，有着重大的意义。
    实行精兵简政，是一场尖锐的、深刻的阶级斗争。新的革命机构，同剥削阶级的旧观念，旧作风，存在着尖锐的矛盾。一小撮叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派，没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，以及旧的习惯势力，必然要从多方面干扰和冲击新生的革命委员会。新生的革命委员会要勇敢地跳出原来旧机构的圈子。必须采取坚决态度，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线，批判保守主义，击破剥削阶级旧势力的抵抗。
    各级革命委员会，中央各工作部门，都要象灵宝县那样，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，做好清理阶级队伍的工作，走“精兵简政”的道路。如果大多数的革命委员会把清理阶级队伍、实行精兵简政这两件工作抓好了，就是从组织上巩固和发展了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果。
    本报讯　河南省灵宝县革命委员会遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于革命委员会的最新指示，在斗争实践中不断总结经验教训，精兵简政，改进工作作风，努力“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”，进一步发挥了革命政权的威力。
    灵宝县革委会在今年一月三日成立以后，对革委会的组织建设和机构设置，曾进行了多次研究。由于受旧思想、旧框框的束缚，改来改去，机构搞得还是很大，设立了“八组两室”：政宣组、组织组、农村组、内务组、财贸组、工交组、文卫组、统计组和革委会办公室、文革办公室。办事人员近百人。有些事情本来过一次手就可以解决，但是这个组推那个组，这个干部推那个干部，问题不能及时解决，革命、生产受影响，群众有意见。贫下中农说：你们办事，过场太多，找了三番五次，问题还没有解决，革委会工作应该改进改进。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”灵宝县革委会成员认真学习了这一光辉指示，联系以往工作中的经验教训，大查了机构庞杂的危害性，大议了“精兵简政”的好处，总结出“五害五好”：（一）机构庞杂的害处是脱离群众，高高在上；精兵简政的好处是便于深入群众，向群众学习。（二）机构庞杂的害处是人浮于事，工作推推拖拖；精兵简政的好处是组织机构精悍有力，有利于培养认真负责的工作作风。（三）机构庞杂的害处是助长官气，增长私心；精兵简政的好处是能“官”能民，破私立公。（四）机构庞杂的害处是容易脱离阶级斗争，脱离实际；精兵简政的好处是干部能够经常到阶级斗争的大风浪中经风雨，见世面。（五）机构庞杂的害处是容易变成官僚机构，成为产生修正主义的温床，不利于人的思想革命化；精兵简政的好处是有利于突出无产阶级政治，抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀，促进人的思想革命化。通过学习讨论，大家一致认为：革委会的组织建设，必须走毛主席指出的“精兵简政”的道路。
    新的组织机构把原来的“八组两室”改为四个组：政治工作组、抓革命促生产指挥组、保卫组、办事组。办公人员由原来的近百人减少到三十人（包括解放军代表十二人）。原县委、县人委的工作人员除参加革委会办公的以外，一部分留机关搞斗批改，一部分组成毛泽东思想宣传队，深入农村，深入基层。
    组织机构精简以后，人少事多怎么办？他们认真地学习了毛主席的光辉著作《党委会的工作方法》和有关群众路线的教导，突出地抓两点：一是千头万绪抓根本。工作再忙，任务再大，总是把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，抓好革委会工作人员的思想政治工作，保证一组顶几组用，一人顶几人干。领导相信群众，工作大胆放手，一般问题，分别由各组有关办事人员研究处理，改变了过去事事请示领导，头头说了才算数的状况。二是深入群众，走群众路线，大量问题在基层单位解决，改变了以往那种“下边问题多，上边积压多，矛盾光上交，迟迟不解决”的旧作风。县革委会主要成员遵照毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”和“干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”的教导，经常深入农村，和群众同学习、同吃、同住、同劳动。哪里困难大，就到哪里去；哪里情况复杂，就到哪里去；哪里工作艰苦，就到哪里去。有一个公社距县城较远，情况比较复杂，革委会建立以后，一小撮阶级敌人大刮翻案妖风，煽动群众不服从革委会领导，阻碍革命和工作的开展。县革委会主要负责人，带着毛主席著作，到这个公社，协助公社革命委员会和无产阶级革命派举办毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓阶级斗争。他们把群众很好地发动起来，揭开了右倾翻案妖风的内幕，揪出了反革命两面派，有力地教育了群众。受蒙蔽群众纷纷反戈一击，打退了阶级敌人的进攻，进一步巩固了革命委员会。有一个公社两派斗争很激烈，革命委员会长时间建立不起来。县革委会一个常委就带着毛主席最新指示，到那里和大家共同学习，斗私批修。双方本着“各自多做自我批评”的原则，分别检查了本组织的错误，在毛泽东思想的基础上联合了起来，迅速成立了革命委员会。
    组织机构精简以后，领导干部的工作作风也有了改进。他们深入各组，深入基层，随时随地解决问题。走到哪里，就在哪里办公。有时在树下，有时在渠边，有时在机关，有时在街头，到处可以同来访的群众和请示问题的同志商谈，及时答复和解决他们的问题。领导干部处理问题，经常和办事人员共同研究。领导的意见不符合毛泽东思想，办事人员可以批评。一次，外单位有个同志要开外出调查的介绍信，县革委会一位领导同志满口答应，叫办事组人员给写。可是经过询问，不符合上级关于出差外调的指示，办事人员就拒绝给开，并当面向领导提出批评。这位领导同志认为批评得正确，便虚心接受。他高兴地说：“只要有同志们的监督，我们就会少犯错误。”
    最近，灵宝县革委会成员认真地学习了毛主席的最新指示：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”他们决心按照毛主席的伟大教导，相信广大人民群众，依靠广大人民群众，保护广大人民群众，带领全县无产阶级革命派和革命群众，搞好清理阶级队伍的工作，坚决把混入革命队伍内部的叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派以及反革命分子统统揭露出来，彻底斗倒斗臭。
