	Washington and Moscow simultaneously staged the farce of signing the "Non-Proliferation Treaty." The U.S. and the Soviet Union are hurriedly preparing to open a new round of deals. Johnson and Kosygin are in perfect harmony in their so-called "limitation" of nuclear weapons, engaging in counter-revolutionary collusion.

	New China News Agency, July 2nd: The U.S. imperialist leader Johnson and the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin, on the same day, indicated that the U.S. and the Soviet Union will further tighten their counter-revolutionary collusion and accelerate the completion of new counter-revolutionary deals.

	The U.S. imperialist leader Johnson announced on the first day that the U.S. and the Soviet Union, which had just completed the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty" deal, have "reached an agreement to discuss in the near future the issue of limiting and reducing offensive strategic nuclear weapon delivery systems and systems to defend against ballistic missiles."

	Johnson made this announcement about the new deal that is about to open while staging the farce of signing the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty" in Washington. On the same day, in Moscow and London, the signing of this treaty was also staged. To promote this treaty, the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin and the British imperialist leader Wilson also participated in the performance. At the signing ceremony in Moscow, the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin also announced that the Soviet Union had sent a memorandum to other countries regarding so-called "urgent measures to stop the arms race and disarmament." In this memorandum, the Soviet revisionist traitor group actively advocates for a so-called "comprehensive disarmament" deal with the United States.

	The new deal being brewed between the U.S. and the Soviet Union is part of their global counter-revolutionary collusion, crazily pushing their anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people policies. It is a desperate struggle to maintain their remaining nuclear monopoly in the face of the surging tide of world revolutionary struggles, aiming to threaten and blackmail the people of the world with nuclear weapons.

	The series of deals between the U.S. and the Soviet Union are the result of Johnson and Kosygin's secret planning in Glassboro in June 1967 to tighten their global counter-revolutionary collusion. It is the result of the Soviet revisionist traitors selling out the interests of the world's revolutionary people and engaging in secret deals with U.S. imperialism. In his speech on the first day, Johnson mentioned the series of deals between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, saying, "Just a year ago, Chairman Kosygin and I agreed in Glassboro that we could do a lot of work in the future to achieve this result," and "These years are a time of fruitful quiet diplomacy." He also advocated that due to the signing of the "Non-Proliferation Treaty," the counter-revolutionary "momentum" of U.S.-Soviet collusion to suppress world revolution has become more active.

	However, as the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, taught: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are wiped out—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." The more active the counter-revolutionary "momentum" of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, which are surrounded by the world's revolutionary people, the more it exposes their counter-revolutionary nature; the more desperately they struggle, the faster they will head towards destruction.

    华盛顿莫斯科同时上演“防止核扩散条约”签字丑剧
    美苏紧锣密鼓加速准备开张新交易
    约翰逊柯西金一唱一和在所谓“限制”核武器问题上大搞反革命勾结
    新华社二日讯　美帝头子约翰逊和苏修头目柯西金一日—搭一档，表示美苏要进一步加紧反革命大勾结，加速作成新的反革命交易。
    美帝头子约翰逊一日宣布，最近刚完成了所谓“防止核扩散条约”交易的美帝和苏修，又“已经达成协议，同意在最近的将来，讨论限制和减少进攻性战略核武器运载系统和防范弹道导弹的系统的问题”。
    约翰逊是在华盛顿上演所谓“防止核扩散条约”的签字丑剧时宣布这笔即将开张的新交易的。同一天，在莫斯科和伦敦，也上演了这个条约的签字丑剧。为了给这个条约捧场，苏修头目柯西金和英帝头目威尔逊，也都参加了丑剧的串演。在莫斯科举行的签字仪式上，苏修头目柯西金还宣布，苏联已经向其他国家发出了关于所谓“停止军备竞赛和裁军的紧急措施备忘录”。在这个备忘录里，苏修叛徒集团积极鼓吹同美国作成所谓“全面裁军”的交易。
    美帝和苏修之间正在酝酿的新交易，是它们实行全球反革命大勾结，疯狂推行反华、反共、反人民政策的组成部分；是它们在世界人民革命斗争怒潮澎湃的形势下，力图保持自己残存的核垄断地位，以对世界人民进行核威胁和核讹诈的一种绝望挣扎。
    美帝苏修之间这一桩又一桩的交易，是约翰逊和柯西金一九六七年六月在葛拉斯堡罗进行秘密策划，加紧全球反革命大勾结的结果，是苏修叛徒出卖世界革命人民利益，同美帝国主义搞秘密交易的结果。约翰逊在一日的讲话中谈到美苏之间这一连串的交易时说，“正好在一年前，柯西金主席和我在葛拉斯堡罗一致认为我们今后可以大力进行工作以实现这个结果”，“这些年是富于成果的进行悄悄的外交活动的时候”。他还鼓吹由于“防止核扩散条约”的缔结，美苏勾结镇压世界革命的反革命“动力变得活跃起来了”。
    但是，正如世界革命人民伟大领袖毛主席所教导的：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”处在全世界革命人民重重包围之中的美帝和苏修的反革命“动力”越活跃，就越加暴露出它们的反革命本质；它们越拚死地挣扎，就越要加速走向灭亡。
