	Empty Words Won't Fill Empty Stomachs

	As many Indian states are once again facing severe famine, with tens of millions of Indian farmers threatened by severe hunger, the reactionary government leaders of India, such as Indira Gandhi, and the propaganda machines they control, are boasting about India's "bumper harvest." They brazenly claim things like "no reliance on foreign aid for grain in three years" and "no grain imports in two or three years." These boasters are truly shameless.

	Lenin once pointed out: Apart from using violence, the governments of the bourgeoisie and landlords suppress the people in another way, "that is, by deceiving, flattering, making empty promises, granting small favors, yielding on minor issues but not on major ones, and so on."

	The Indian reactionaries are adept at this. To maintain their reactionary rule, they have consistently used both bloody suppression and political deception against the broad masses of the Indian people. Blowing their own horns and lying are their specialties. In 1956, Indira Gandhi's father, Nehru, once boasted that within five years, India would not only have enough grain to feed its own people but also export even more. The result was that five years later, instead of exporting, India imported even more grain. In 1961, the leaders of the Congress Party again boasted that within five years, grain production would reach one billion tons. However, by 1966, grain production not only did not increase but actually decreased, falling below the production level of five years earlier. The Indian reactionaries have always shamelessly used empty talk to deal with the dissatisfaction of the broad masses. Blowing their own horns, failing, blowing their own horns again, failing again—this has become the rule of action for the Indian reactionaries on the grain issue over the past decade. Recently, due to the spread of famine in many regions of India, Indira Gandhi is once again using this old trick, attempting to deceive the Indian people.

	However, no matter how beautifully empty words are spoken, they cannot fill the stomachs of the starving masses. The broad masses of the Indian people have long gained an experience from their personal sufferings: the Indian reactionaries always blow their own horns; they always go hungry; the bigger the Indian reactionaries' horns, the tighter their belts. The Indian people are increasingly aware that only by overthrowing the evil rule of the big landlords and big capitalists can the Indian people improve their lives. Today, in India, the revolutionary masses are fighting against hunger and for survival, with struggles rising here and there. The blowing and lying of Indira Gandhi and her ilk can only further arouse the anger of the Indian people and further promote their struggles.

	The famine in India is severe, with millions of laboring people living in misery, surviving on tree leaves, grass roots, and jute leaves. This family has no grain to eat, so they have to fill their stomachs with "bread" made from wild grains.

### 空话填不饱肚皮

    空话填不饱肚皮
    正当印度许多邦再度发生严重粮荒，数百万印度农民遭到严重饥饿威胁的时候，印度反动政府的头头英迪拉·甘地之流和他们控制的宣传机器，却在大肆吹嘘印度的“大丰收”。他们胡吹什么“三年内粮食不依赖外援”、“两、三年后不再进口粮食”云云。这些牛皮大王真是可以说是无耻到家了。
    列宁曾经指出：各个资产阶级的和地主的政府压制人民，除了使用暴力之外还有另外一种方法，“这就是欺骗，恭维，说空话，无数的约许，小恩小惠，小处让步大处不放等等。”
    印度反动派是惯于此道的。他们为了维持其反动统治，一贯对印度广大人民采取血腥镇压和政治欺骗的反革命两手。吹牛撒谎是他们的拿手本领。一九五六年，英迪拉·甘地的父亲尼赫鲁就曾拍胸脯保证，印度在五年之后“不仅要在国内充分供应粮食，而且还要出口更多的粮食”。结果五年后不是出口，而是进口更多的粮食。一九六一年，国大党头头们又吹牛说，五年后粮食年产量要上升到一亿吨。但是，到一九六六年，粮食产量不仅不是上升，而且是下降，比五年前的产量还要低。印度反动派就是这样一直厚着脸皮讲空话来应付广大群众的不满。吹牛，破产，再吹牛，再破产，这已成为近十年来印度反动派在粮食问题上的一条行动守则。最近，由于印度许多地区饥荒开始蔓延，英迪拉·甘地又在重施这种故技，妄图愚弄印度人民。
    但是，空话说得再漂亮，也填不饱广大饥民的肚皮。广大的印度人民从他们的切身遭遇中早已获得了一条经验：印度反动派老是吹牛皮，他们老是饿肚皮；印度反动派的牛皮吹得越大，他们的裤带就勒得越紧。印度人民日益清楚地认识到，只有推翻大地主大资产阶级的罪恶统治，印度人民才有可能改善他们的生活。在今天的印度，革命人民群众反饥饿、求生存的斗争此伏彼起。英迪拉·甘地之流的吹牛撒谎，只能更加激起印度人民的愤怒，更加促进他们的斗争。（附图片）
