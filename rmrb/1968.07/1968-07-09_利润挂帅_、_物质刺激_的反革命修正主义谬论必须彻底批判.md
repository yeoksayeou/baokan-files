The winds of Mount Zhongshan rise, and the Yellow River turns blue. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we, the broad masses of revolutionary proletarians and hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, have risen up with the mighty cudgel of Mao Zedong Thought, smashing the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev. Currently, the revolutionary proletarians fighting on all fronts are pressing ahead, deeply and persistently carrying out the revolutionary criticism, eliminating the poisonous influence of China's Khrushchev's reactionary revisionism.

Since the founding of the nation, China's Khrushchev and his agents on the industrial and transportation fronts have frantically pushed the reactionary revisionist line, vigorously promoting the reactionary fallacies of "profit in command" and "material incentives," opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The reactionary fallacies of "profit in command" and "material incentives" promoted by China's Khrushchev are highly poisonous and extremely harmful. They must be thoroughly criticized.

(I)

In socialist economic construction, the question is whether to adhere to the principle of politics leading the economy and the principle of socialist planned economy, or to implement "profit in command" and the capitalist principle of "free competition." This is a fundamental difference between us and China's Khrushchev and his agents on the industrial and transportation fronts.

We are a socialist country. We are building socialism and must follow Chairman Mao's teachings of "developing the economy and ensuring supply" and "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people." We must implement the principle of politics leading the economy and the principle of socialist planned economy. Therefore, the arrangement of economic construction projects, the formulation of production plans, and the direction of enterprise development must first serve the party's political tasks, serve the needs of the Chinese and world proletarian revolution, and serve the state plan that embodies Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

However, China's Khrushchev and his ilk go in the opposite direction. They vigorously advocate "managing the economy with economic methods," promoting "profit in command" and "profit first," shouting loudly: "If it is profitable, produce it; if it is not profitable, close the factory." They follow the methods of "three selfs and one package" and Yugoslavian enterprise autonomy, implementing so-called "five fixes" by the state on enterprises and "five guarantees" by enterprises on the state, "based on the principle of more production, more gain," and "extracting reward funds." They pursue profit and the economic interests of enterprises and individuals as the driving force of socialist production; they treat the capitalist and revisionist "profit principle" as the golden rule.

What would happen in a socialist economy if "profit in command" were implemented? Under the rule of the revisionist clique, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union have turned their socialist economies into capitalist economies through a series of measures to restore capitalism, including "profit in command." This is a very real lesson.

Implementing "profit in command" would inevitably mean that the law of value dominates everything. Whatever is profitable and yields quick returns would be pursued. Under this policy, industries that require heavy investment and have a slow return but are crucial for the high-speed development of China's economic construction would not be established, and there would be no rational layout. The task of mechanizing China's agriculture would not be realized.

Implementing "profit in command" would lead to free competition among various economic departments and enterprises, resulting in speculation, shoddy work, technological secrecy, and competition for technical personnel, which are common phenomena in capitalist society. The current socialist relations of mutual support and cooperation among enterprises under the unified national plan would be replaced by capitalist relations of mutual competition and mutual destruction; social production would inevitably fall into a state of anarchy.

Implementing "profit in command" would lead enterprises, in pursuit of their own economic interests, to arbitrarily change product directions and produce shoddy goods. The principles of socialist production would be abandoned, and the daily necessities for China's 700 million people would not be guaranteed, damaging the worker-peasant alliance and socialist urban-rural relations.

Implementing "profit in command" would inevitably lead to certain leaders of enterprises controlling all powers, with some even using various privileges to appropriate the fruits of workers' labor, becoming new exploiters and privileged classes, and becoming agents of China's Khrushchev in restoring capitalism; the leadership and subordinate relationship in factories and mines would inevitably turn into a relationship of exploitation and being exploited.

China's Khrushchev and his ilk oppose politics leading the economy and the principle of socialist planned economy, pushing "profit in command." Their purpose is to transform China's socialist economy according to capitalist principles, destroying the modernization of China's industry, agriculture, and national defense, keeping China's industry in a deformed and incomplete backward state, forever becoming a raw material market and vassal of foreign capital, tying China's economy to the old cart of imperialism and revisionism. In a word, they want to undermine the economic foundation of China's proletarian dictatorship, turning China's socialist economy into an economy that is "public" in form but "private" in reality, "socialist" in form but "capitalist" in reality, making China return to the old path of semi-colonialism and semi-feudalism.

(II)

In socialist economic construction, the question is whether to adhere to politics in command and emphasize proletarian politics, or to push material incentives and implement "money in command." This is another fundamental difference between us and China's Khrushchev and his agents on the industrial and transportation fronts.

Politics is the commander, the soul. "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we must emphasize proletarian politics, strengthen political and ideological work, and improve the ideological transformation of the masses, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers to build socialism.

China's Khrushchev and his ilk vigorously oppose emphasizing proletarian politics, pushing material incentives, and using material incentives as an important means of their counter-revolutionary restoration. They are the advocates of material incentives. They shout: "Material incentives are necessary," "I support material incentives!" They shamelessly push material incentives in all fields of socialist economic construction, implementing the "three highs" policy of high wages, high bonuses, and high remuneration, vigorously maintaining and expanding bourgeois rights, attempting to create a high-income class in China, and cultivating a social base for their usurpation of the party, seizure of power, and restoration of capitalism.

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "Emphasizing politics is not an arbitrary policy, not something that can be done this way or that way. It is a fundamental measure proposed based on the development laws of socialist society and the economic base of socialist society."

Socialist economy is based on the public ownership of the means of production, requiring the superstructure to adapt to the socialist economic base, promoting the development of socialist productive forces, and gradually transitioning to communism.

Politics in command and material incentives are two fundamentally opposed things: one is the proletariat's "public," and the other is the bourgeoisie's "private"; one is socialism, and the other is capitalism. Politics in command mobilizes the enthusiasm for socialism; material incentives mobilize the enthusiasm for the capitalist road. The more material incentives there are, the farther away from socialism.

China's Khrushchev and his ilk push material incentives, using the remaining private ownership concepts in people's minds to poison the working class ideologically with bourgeois individualism, dispersing revolutionary fighting spirit; organizationally disintegrating the working class ranks, restoring capitalism.

Everyone knows that from Jinggangshan to Yan'an, and until the national liberation, in the arduous years of revolutionary war, our revolutionary fighters, risking their lives, fought bravely, overcoming unprecedented difficulties, displaying high revolutionary heroism and optimism, achieving victory in the people's revolution. Was this achieved through material incentives? Absolutely not! We relied on the inspiration of communist ideals and the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. China's Khrushchev and his ilk attempt to replace our party's long-standing tradition of politics in command and hard struggle with the rotten principle of revisionist material incentives. This is absolutely impossible! We must forever emphasize proletarian politics, emphasize Mao Zedong Thought, and serve the people wholeheartedly.

China's Khrushchev and his ilk push material incentives so frantically, entirely determined by their reactionary bourgeois worldview. China's Khrushchev and his ilk are extreme bourgeois egoists. They always view everything from the perspective of money. They say: "Selflessness and altruism are for outstanding communists. For the majority of people, material incentives are still needed." In the eyes of these counter-revolutionary revisionists, China's working class and laboring people are all narrow-minded, shortsighted, and selfish, all mere "mob" to be manipulated by them. This is a great insult to China's working class and laboring people!

China's working class is the leading class of the revolution, the most selfless. "In the revolutionary struggle, they are more resolute and thorough than any other class." "The entire class is the most revolutionary." "Under the leadership of their revolutionary party—the Communist Party of China—they have become the most conscious class in Chinese society." They are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the past, they followed the great leader Chairman Mao, under the leadership of their vanguard—the great Communist Party of China—they led the people of the entire nation, overthrowing the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, establishing the great People's Republic of China. In the socialist revolution and socialist construction, they followed the great leader Chairman Mao, under the leadership of their vanguard—the great Communist Party of China—they led the people of the entire nation, achieving one great victory after another, making our great motherland prosperous and strong day by day. Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, the working class and laboring people are experiencing an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, further shaking off the shackles of thousands of years of old ideas, fundamentally cleansing all the filth left by the old world. The noble virtues of not seeking fame or wealth, not fearing hardship or death, wholeheartedly for the revolution, and everything for the people are becoming the universal social ethos of our country.

China's Khrushchev and his agents on the industrial and transportation fronts frantically push the reactionary economism, promoting "profit in command" and "material incentives," which are important components of their counter-revolutionary revisionist line. China's Khrushchev and his ilk push "profit in command" and "material incentives," aiming to use reactionary economism to lure people into pursuing immediate economic interests, abandoning the fundamental interests of the proletarian dictatorship, allowing them to carry out counter-revolutionary restoration, turning proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship, and turning socialism into capitalism.

We must unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's latest instruction of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," resolutely and thoroughly criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by China's Khrushchev and his ilk, eliminating their poisonous influence! We must turn the industrial and transportation fronts into a bright red school of Mao Zedong Thought, ensuring that China's socialist mountains will never change color!

    “利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”的反革命修正主义谬论必须彻底批判
    国家经委无产阶级革命派
    “钟山风雨起苍黄，百万雄师过大江。”我们广大的无产阶级革命派和亿万革命群众，在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，捣毁了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。目前，战斗在各条战线上的无产阶级革命派，正在乘胜追击，深入地持久地开展革命大批判，清除中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义的流毒。
    建国以来，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在工业交通战线上的代理人，疯狂地推行反革命修正主义路线，大肆鼓吹“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”的反革命谬论，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”的反革命谬论，流毒甚广，危害甚大，必须彻底批判。
    （一）
    在社会主义经济建设中，是坚持政治统帅经济，坚持社会主义计划经济的原则，还是实行“利润挂帅”，实行资本主义的“自由竞争”的原则，这是我们同中国赫鲁晓夫及其在工业交通战线上的代理人的一个根本分歧。
    我们是社会主义国家，我们搞社会主义建设，必须根据毛主席的“发展经济，保障供给”、“备战、备荒、为人民”的教导，实行政治统帅经济，实行社会主义计划经济原则。因此，经济建设项目的安排，生产方案的制定，企业的发展方向，必须首先服从党的政治任务，服从中国和世界无产阶级革命的需要，服从体现毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的国家计划。
    中国赫鲁晓夫之流却反其道而行之，他们极力宣扬“按经济办法管理经济”，鼓吹“利润挂帅”，“赚钱第一”，大叫大嚷：“有利就生产”，“无利就关厂”。他们按照“三自一包”和南斯拉夫的企业自治的办法，搞什么国家对企业实行所谓“五定”、企业对国家实行“五保”，“根据多超多得的原则”，“提取奖励基金”。他们把追逐利润，追逐企业和个人“经济利益”作为社会主义生产的动力；他们把资本主义、修正主义的“利润原则”当成金科玉律。
    在社会主义经济中，实行“利润挂帅”，会是什么样的情景呢？南斯拉夫和苏联在修正主义集团的统治下，通过“利润挂帅”等一系列复辟资本主义的措施，社会主义经济蜕变成资本主义经济，这是最现实的教训。
    实行“利润挂帅”，必然是价值规律主宰一切，什么赚钱多、得利快就搞什么。在这种方针指导下，投资多，“见效慢”，但关系到我国经济建设高速度发展的基础工业就不能建立，更不会有合理的布局；我国农业机械化的任务就不能实现。
    实行“利润挂帅”，在各经济部门、各企业之间就会出现自由竞争，就会出现投机倒把，偷工减料，封锁技术秘密，争夺技术人员等等资本主义社会的普遍现象。我国企业间现行的在国家统一计划下，互相支援、互相协作的社会主义关系，就要为互相竞争、互相倾轧的资本主义关系所代替；社会生产就必然陷于无政府状态。
    实行“利润挂帅”，企业为了追求本单位的经济利益，就会任意改变产品方向，粗制滥造。社会主义生产原则就会被抛弃，我国七亿人口的日常生活必需品就会得不到保障，工农联盟和社会主义城乡关系就要遭到破坏。
    实行“利润挂帅”，必然导致企业的某些领导人操纵一切大权，有些人甚至会利用种种特权，侵占工人劳动成果，变成新的剥削者、特权阶层，成为中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的代理人；工矿企业里的领导和被领导的关系必然变成剥削和被剥削的关系。
    中国赫鲁晓夫之流反对政治统帅经济，反对社会主义计划经济原则，推行“利润挂帅”，其目的就是要按照资本主义的原则，改造我国社会主义经济，破坏我国工业、农业和国防的现代化，使我国工业永远处于畸形布局、残缺不全的落后状态，永远成为外国资本的原料市场和附庸，把我国经济拴在帝国主义、修正主义老牛破车上爬行。一句话，他们就是要瓦解我国无产阶级专政的经济基础，把我国社会主义经济蜕变成形“公”实“私”，形“社”实“资”的经济，使我国重新回到半殖民地、半封建的老路上去。
    （二）
    在社会主义经济建设中，是坚持政治挂帅，突出无产阶级政治；还是大搞物质刺激，推行“钞票挂帅”，这是我们同中国赫鲁晓夫及其在工业交通战线上的代理人的另一个根本分歧。
    政治是统帅，是灵魂。“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”按照毛主席的教导，必须突出无产阶级政治，加强政治思想工作，搞好人的思想革命化，调动广大职工建设社会主义的积极性。
    中国赫鲁晓夫之流极力反对突出无产阶级政治，大搞物质刺激，把物质刺激作为他们搞反革命复辟的重要手段。他们是物质刺激的鼓吹者。他们狂叫：“物质刺激是必要的”，“我就赞成物质刺激”！他们在社会主义经济建设的各个领域内，肆无忌惮地推行物质刺激，大搞高工资、高奖金、高稿酬的“三高”政策，极力维护和扩大资产阶级法权，妄图在我国制造高薪阶层，为他们篡党窃国、复辟资本主义培植社会基础。
    林彪同志指出：“突出政治不是一项任意的政策，不是可以这样做，也可以那样做。这是根据社会主义社会的发展规律和社会主义社会的经济基础所提出的根本措施。”社会主义经济是建立在生产资料公有制基础上的，要求上层建筑适应社会主义经济基础，推动社会主义生产力的发展，向共产主义逐步过渡。
    政治挂帅同物质刺激是两个根本对立的东西：一个是无产阶级的“公”，一个是资产阶级的“私”；一个是社会主义，一个是资本主义。政治挂帅调动的是干社会主义的积极性；物质刺激调动的是走资本主义道路的积极性。物质刺激越多，离社会主义越远。
    中国赫鲁晓夫之流大搞物质刺激，就是利用残留在人们头脑中的私有观念，用资产阶级个人主义从思想上来毒害工人阶级，涣散革命斗志；从组织上瓦解工人阶级队伍，复辟资本主义。
    大家知道，从井冈山到延安，一直到全国解放，在革命战争的艰苦岁月里，我们的革命战士，出生入死，前赴后继，战胜了人间罕有的困难，发扬了高度的革命英雄主义和乐观主义精神，取得了人民革命的胜利。这难道是依靠物质刺激吗？完全不是！我们靠的是共产主义理想的鼓舞，靠的是毛泽东思想的哺育。中国赫鲁晓夫之流妄图用腐朽的修正主义物质刺激原则，代替我党历来坚持的政治挂帅、艰苦奋斗的革命优良传统，这是万万办不到的！我们要永远突出无产阶级政治，突出毛泽东思想，完全彻底地为人民服务。
    中国赫鲁晓夫之流如此疯狂地推行物质刺激，完全是由他灵魂深处的反动资产阶级世界观决定的。中国赫鲁晓夫之流是一群极端的资产阶级利己主义者。他们总是从钱眼里看待一切。他们胡说什么：“毫不利己，专门利人，这是对优秀共产党员讲的。对于大多数人来说，还是需要物质刺激的。”在这帮反革命修正主义分子看来，我国工人阶级和劳动人民，尽是只管个人生活，只顾眼前利益，心胸狭窄，鼠目寸光的芸芸众生，尽是任他们驱使的“群氓”。这是对我国工人阶级和劳动人民的莫大污辱！
    我国工人阶级是革命的领导阶级，是最大公无私的。“他们在革命斗争中，比任何别的阶级来得坚决和彻底。”“整个阶级都是最革命的。”“在本阶级的革命政党——中国共产党领导之下，成为中国社会里比较最有觉悟的阶级”。他们无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。过去，他们紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，在自己的先锋队——伟大的中国共产党领导下，带领全国人民，推翻了国民党的反动统治，建立了伟大的中华人民共和国。在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，他们紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，在自己的先锋队——伟大的中国共产党领导下，带领全国人民，夺得了一个又一个的伟大胜利，使我们伟大祖国一天天繁荣富强起来。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，工人阶级和劳动人民，经历着史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，正在进一步摆脱几千年来旧思想的束缚，从根本上荡涤旧世界遗留下来的一切污泥浊水。不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命，一切为人民的崇高品德，正在成为我们国家普遍的社会风尚。
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其在工业交通战线上的代理人，疯狂推行的反革命经济主义，大搞“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”，是他们反革命修正主义路线的重要组成部分。中国赫鲁晓夫之流大搞“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”，其目的就是妄图用反革命经济主义，引诱人们追求眼前经济利益，抛开无产阶级专政的根本利益，任凭他们搞反革命复辟，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政，变社会主义为资本主义。
      我们一定要不折不扣地执行毛主席“要斗私，批修”的最新指示，坚决地彻底地把中国赫鲁晓夫之流推行的反革命修正主义路线批倒批臭，肃清其流毒！把工业交通战线办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，保证我国社会主义江山永不变色！
