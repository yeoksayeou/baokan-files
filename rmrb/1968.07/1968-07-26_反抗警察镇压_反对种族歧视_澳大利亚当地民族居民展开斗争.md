	According to a report by the Australian *Vanguard* on July 25, indigenous residents in the small town of Laiverton near the mining center of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia recently rose up to resist police violence and oppose racial discrimination.

	These indigenous residents used spears, boomerangs, and stones as weapons to counterattack the police who came to suppress them, demonstrating their strong resistance. Under the savage suppression of the Australian ruling class, three indigenous residents were unjustly arrested, and one 18-year-old youth was unjustly sentenced.
