The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article on July 5, praising the Thai Communist Party-led people of Northeastern Thailand and their armed forces for their high revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, setting a brilliant example for all Thai people.

The article pointed out that the initial sparks of people's armed revolutionary struggle, which first ignited in the Northeast, have now spread into a raging inferno, engulfing the entire country and forming a sea of people's war, increasingly striking heavy blows against the reactionary rule of the U.S.-Thanom clique.

The article said that the Thai Communist Party bravely leads the Thai people's armed struggle, continuously summing up experiences and raising the level of struggle. As early as the initial stage of the armed struggle, the Thai Communist Party pointed out the great significance and bright future of armed struggle. In the December 1, 1966, proclamation on the 24th anniversary of the party's founding, it stated: "The initial victories of the armed people in the Northeast and South not only prove that the U.S. imperialists and their lackey, the Thanom-Praphat clique, are paper tigers, and that the people can definitely defeat them, but also indicate that the struggle of the Thai people has entered a new stage. It sets an example for the whole nation, inspiring and promoting the rapid development and growth of the Thai people's revolutionary struggle." Currently, armed struggle has become the main form of struggle for the Thai people, rapidly pushing the Thai people's revolutionary struggle decisively forward on the correct path of armed seizure of power.

The article pointed out that Northeastern Thailand is an important strategic base for the U.S. to occupy Thailand and expand its war of aggression. Many important military bases of U.S. imperialism and most of its invading troops are concentrated in the Northeast. The rapid development and growth of the people's struggle in the Northeast are increasingly striking heavy blows against the U.S. imperialists' aggressive forces in Thailand.

The article said that U.S. imperialism is extremely fearful of the armed people in the Northeast. It is urgently colluding with the Thanom-Praphat traitorous clique, adopting various counter-revolutionary measures, attempting to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the people in the Northeast. Besides providing the Thanom-Praphat traitorous clique with large amounts of military supplies and funds every year, specifically used to suppress the people and armed forces in the Northeast, U.S. imperialism is openly dispatching invading troops to directly participate in the criminal activities of suppressing the people in the Northeast.

The article said that the people and armed forces in the Northeast have been persistently struggling under extremely difficult conditions. They are "determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," displaying the mighty power of people's war. In the arduous battles, they continuously annihilate the enemy, preserving and expanding their own forces. The people and armed forces in the Northeast have tied down a large part of the reactionary armed forces of the U.S.-Thanom clique, greatly supporting the people's armed struggle in various parts of the country.

The article said that the facts of the people in the Northeast and their armed forces continuously overcoming difficulties and gradually achieving victories completely prove the teachings of the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong: "The world has no smooth roads; one must be prepared to travel winding roads and not seek easy gains. One cannot imagine that one day, all reactionaries will kneel down on the ground. In short, the future is bright, but the road is tortuous. There are still many difficulties ahead of us, which should not be overlooked. We and the entire people unite and strive together, definitely able to overcome all difficulties and achieve the goal of victory." The article emphasized that the important guarantee for the revolutionary struggle of the people in the Northeast to advance from victory to victory is: following the correct leadership of the Thai Communist Party, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, combining the invincible Mao Zedong Thought with actual struggle, and firmly adhering to the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao.

The article finally called on all people to learn from each other, support each other, and promote each other, striving for new victories in the revolutionary struggle.

According to the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station, under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, the Thai people's armed forces have displayed the mighty power of people's war and achieved brilliant results in the first half of this year.

The radio station said that preliminary statistics show that from January to June this year, the Thai people's armed forces engaged in nearly 400 battles with U.S.-Thai reactionary military and police, killing and wounding nearly 500 enemy personnel, destroying many enemy vehicles, and shooting down and damaging many enemy aircraft. In the past half year, the armed forces also sent "armed propaganda teams" to conduct more than 50 propaganda and mobilization activities in enemy-occupied villages, receiving warm welcome from the broad masses.

The radio station said that in May, the U.S.-Thai reactionaries dispatched more than 5,000 reactionary military and police to "encircle and suppress" the people's armed forces active in the foothills of Pupan Mountain, Sakhon Nakhon, and Nakhon Phanom. They were met with a head-on counterattack by the brave people and armed forces of Northeastern Thailand. The radio station pointed out that the brilliant victories achieved by the Thai people's armed forces in the past half year have shattered the U.S.-Thanom clique's delusions of using force to extinguish the flames of the Thai people's patriotic armed struggle, greatly inspiring the Thai people to persist in revolutionary armed struggle to defeat the U.S.-Thai reactionaries.

    “泰国人民之声”热烈赞扬东北部人民武装的革命精神
    把人民武装斗争烈火燃遍全国
    泰共领导的人民武装发挥人民战争强大威力今年上半年取得辉煌战果
    新华社七日讯　“泰国人民之声”电台五日广播一篇文章，热烈赞扬泰国共产党所领导的泰国东北部人民和人民武装，具有高度的敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，为泰国全体人民树立了光辉的榜样。
    文章指出，首先在东北部燃烧起来的人民革命武装斗争的星星之火，目前已经蔓延成为燎原烈火，燃遍全国各地，汇成人民战争的火海，日益沉重地打击着美国—他侬集团的反动统治。
    文章说，泰国共产党勇敢地领导着泰国人民武装斗争，不断地总结经验，提高斗争水平。早在人民武装斗争刚刚开始阶段，泰国共产党就指出了武装斗争的伟大意义和光明前途。泰国共产党在一九六六年十二月一日建党二十四周年的文告中曾经指出：“东北部和南部人民武装所取得的初步胜利，不仅证明了美帝国主义及其走狗他侬—巴博集团都是纸老虎，人民完全能够把它打败的这一事实，还说明了泰国人民的斗争已跨进新的阶段。它给全国人民树立了榜样，鼓舞和推动了泰国人民的革命斗争迅速发展壮大。”目前，武装斗争已经成为泰国人民斗争的最主要形式，它迅速地推动了泰国人民革命斗争坚决沿着武装夺取政权的正确道路猛进。
    文章指出，泰国东北部是美帝用来占领泰国和扩大侵略战争的重要战略基地。美帝国主义的许多重要军事基地和大部分侵略军都集中在东北部。东北部人民的革命斗争迅速发展壮大，越来越沉重地打击着美帝国主义在泰国的侵略势力。
    文章说，美帝国主义极端害怕东北部人民武装，它正加紧勾结他侬—巴博卖国集团，采用各种反革命措施，妄图扑灭东北部人民的革命烈火。美帝国主义除了每年向他侬—巴博卖国集团提供大量专门用来镇压东北部人民和人民武装的军用物资和经费以外，还公然派出侵略军直接参加镇压东北部人民的罪恶活动。
    文章说，东北部人民和人民武装一直在极端困难的条件下坚持斗争，他们“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，发挥人民战争的强大威力，在艰苦的战斗中，不断消灭敌人，保存和壮大自己的力量。东北部人民和人民武装牵制了美国—他侬集团的大部分反动武装力量，极大地支援了全国各地的人民武装斗争。
    文章说，东北部人民和人民武装这种不断克服困难，逐步取得胜利的事实，完全证明了世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的教导：“世界上没有直路，要准备走曲折的路，不要贪便宜。不能设想，那一天早上，一切反动派会统统自己跪在地下。总之，前途是光明的，道路是曲折的。我们面前困难还多，不可忽视。我们和全体人民团结起来，共同努力，一定能够排除万难，达到胜利的目的。”文章强调指出，东北部人民的革命斗争能够从胜利走向胜利的重要保证是：遵照泰国共产党的正确领导，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把战无不胜的毛泽东思想同实际斗争相结合，坚定不移地坚持毛泽东主席的革命路线。
    文章最后号召全国人民互相学习，互相支援，互相推动，争取革命斗争的新胜利。
    新华社五日讯　据“泰国人民之声”电台五日广播：在泰国共产党领导下的泰国人民武装，发挥人民战争的强大威力，今年上半年取得了辉煌战果。
    这家电台说，据初步统计，从今年一月到六月，泰国人民武装同美泰反动军警战斗近四百次，共打死、打伤敌人近五百名，击毁敌人军车多辆，打落、打伤敌机多架。半年来，人民武装还派出“武装宣传队”深入敌后村庄进行五十多次宣传动员群众的工作，受到广大群众的热烈欢迎。
    电台说，美泰反动派在五月间曾派遣五千多名反动军警“围剿”活跃在普潘山麓，沙功那空、那空拍侬府的人民武装，遭到英勇的泰国东北部人民和人民武装的迎头痛击。电台指出，泰国人民武装半年来所取得的辉煌胜利，粉碎了美国—他侬集团妄图以武力扑灭泰国人民爱国武装斗争烈火的美梦，极大地鼓舞了泰国人民坚持以革命武装斗争去战胜美泰反动派。
