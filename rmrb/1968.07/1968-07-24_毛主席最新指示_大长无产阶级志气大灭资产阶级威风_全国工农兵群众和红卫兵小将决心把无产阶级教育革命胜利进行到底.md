Our most beloved and respected great teacher and great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Colleges and universities must still be run, and I am mainly talking about technical colleges and universities, but the school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should be in command. We should follow the path of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in training technical personnel from among workers. We should select students from workers and peasants who have practical experience, send them to school for a few years, and then have them return to production practice."

Chairman Mao's great call has sparked the broadest and most enthusiastic response among the hundreds of millions of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, PLA soldiers, students, and revolutionary Red Guards across the country. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, where the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and the revolutionary Red Guards have played a leading role, they are determined, together with all the genuine proletarian revolutionaries on all fronts, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational line represented by China's Khrushchev, and carry the proletarian educational revolution to victory.

The important editorial note of the People's Daily that conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the investigative report "Learning from the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory on the Path to Training Engineering and Technical Personnel" have been broadcast and published in newspapers across the country, reaching every corner of cities and countryside, frontiers, and coastal defense lines. Wherever Chairman Mao's latest instructions reach, there are shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and Red Guards across the country, with their profound proletarian feelings of boundless love and admiration for the great teacher Chairman Mao, have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions over and over again. They say, Chairman Mao's great call is the battle program for carrying the proletarian educational revolution to completion, a sharp weapon for thoroughly smashing the bourgeois educational system, a guiding light for training successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and a long-term plan for ensuring that the socialist state will never change color. Chairman Mao's words have struck a chord with us, and we enthusiastically support and resolutely carry them out.

"Chairman Mao's latest instructions have turned the history that was turned upside down back to its rightful place! It's turned over well, very well!"

Ten years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao personally inscribed the brilliant words for a self-reliant factory in our country: "The humble are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish." Today, when the revolutionary workers of this factory read Chairman Mao's latest instructions, their hearts are filled with emotion. They enthusiastically acclaim Chairman Mao's great instructions, once again shattering the fallacies of the exploiting classes over thousands of years that "those who labor with their minds rule over others, and those who labor with their strength are ruled by others." They say, Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the greatest concern, encouragement, support, and spur for us workers! Chairman Mao's latest instructions greatly boost the spirit of the proletariat and greatly suppress the arrogance of the bourgeoisie! We must thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev's revisionist line of "experts running the factory," earnestly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and scientific and technological line, and turn our factory into a blazing red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Famous national agricultural labor model Wu Chun'an from Shanxi Province, after studying the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, excitedly said, "Chairman Mao's latest instructions have touched the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants." He said, in the evil old society, we laboring people were shut out of universities; after liberation, China's Khrushchev and his agents fiercely resisted Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, still shutting out the broad masses of laboring people from universities. Chairman Mao's latest instructions have completely opened the doors of universities to us, turning the history that was turned upside down back to its rightful place! It's turned over well, very well! We poor and lower-middle peasants cheer a thousand times, support a thousand times! Chairman Mao's latest instructions are our guiding light for carrying out the educational revolution, a guiding light for students to unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Following Chairman Mao's great instructions to run universities, "selecting students from workers and peasants who have practical experience, sending them to school for a few years, and then having them return to production practice," such universities, such students who are red in thought, can labor, can read and write, and can fight, we poor and lower-middle peasants most support running such universities and most need such university students.

Fighting hero Mai Xiande listened to Chairman Mao's latest instructions over and over again on the radio. He said, Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the battle cry for thoroughly burying China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. We must earnestly study, deeply understand, and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, and carry the proletarian educational revolution to completion.

In a steel plant in southeastern China, there is a technician who grew up from a poor peasant cowherd. With a heart that is utterly loyal to Chairman Mao, he has made significant contributions to China's steel industry. Before liberation, he only attended primary school for a year and a half and then dropped out to return home to herd cows and till the land for the landlord. It was Chairman Mao who saved him from the fiery pit and nurtured him into a red technician. After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, he said, no matter how China's Khrushchev and his representatives of counter-revolutionary revisionism suppressed us poor and lower-middle peasants' children in the past, I think of Chairman Mao supporting me, and I am determined to make Chairman Mao proud. In the great struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I finally broke through countless difficulties and made some contributions in the great struggle of seizing the revolution and promoting production. Chairman Mao's latest instructions say: "Proletarian politics must be in command, and we should follow the path of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in training technical personnel from among workers." I resolutely support and will definitely carry it out!

"Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the guiding light for training successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, excellent, very excellent!"

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our educational policy should enable those who receive education to develop morally, intellectually, and physically, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards, upon reviewing Chairman Mao's great teachings, have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They say, Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the guiding light for training and fostering millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, a long-term plan for preventing and guarding against revisionism, excellent, very excellent!

Many pilots in the "Four Good" Flying Squadron of a certain unit of the Air Force, who are red in thought and high in skills, were all selected from soldiers. They have the deepest feelings for Chairman Mao and the Party's proletarian cause. They learned warfare from warfare and improved themselves through practice, quickly mastering the flying skills to annihilate enemies in the sky, and contributing their strength to defending the country's airspace. They pointed out at a symposium that Chairman Mao's latest instructions have pointed out the fundamental direction and path for training successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, a long-term plan for preventing and guarding against revisionism, with extremely profound and great significance. University students trained according to Chairman Mao's great instructions, coming from workers and peasants and serving workers and peasants, will no longer be "spiritual aristocrats" detached from proletarian politics, the masses, and reality. We workers, peasants, and soldiers have confidence in them!

Famous national agricultural labor model Geng Changsuo from Hebei Province said at a study meeting, the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao are the guiding light for the proletarian educational revolution and the scientific and technological revolution. Following Chairman Mao, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and running schools according to Chairman Mao's instructions, training proletarian successors from revolutionary struggles and productive labor, can prevent the emergence of revisionism and ensure that our socialist state will never change color for thousands of years.

The car drivers, car repair workers, and revolutionary young technicians of the car research group of Tianjin People's Automobile Factory Three broke through various shackles of revisionism in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and made some technological innovations. After hearing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they held a meeting to criticize China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist scientific and technological line. Old workers at the meeting excitedly said, we workers must follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, learn from the experience of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, and make greater contributions to the socialist revolution and socialist construction of our motherland.

Graduates of Gansu Industrial University excitedly said: Chairman Mao's latest instructions are like a lighthouse with ten thousand rays of light, illuminating our path forward. We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call, face the countryside, the frontier, the grassroots, and the mines, be the students of the workers and peasants, thoroughly transform the bourgeois worldview, and become successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Beijing's knowledge youth who have settled in the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, excitedly said, Chairman Mao's latest instructions have touched our hearts. We must follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions to guide all our actions, transform our worldview for a lifetime on the anti-revisionist front, change the sky and earth to create a new world, no matter how strong the wind and waves, our red heart loyal to Chairman Mao will never change! No matter how many waves and barriers, our determination to follow the path of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers will never change!

With Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational line and carry the educational revolution to completion!

When studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the masses of workers, peasants, and Red Guards across the country followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "breaking first, then establishing," and carried out a further and deeper criticism of China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational line and scientific and technological line. They expressed their determination to carry out the revolutionary criticism persistently and deeply, and ensure that Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line firmly occupy all positions on the educational and scientific and technological fronts.

In the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory, where China's Khrushchev had repeatedly poisoned the minds, the broad revolutionary workers, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a powerful weapon, severely criticized the revisionist black goods that China's Khrushchev peddled in this factory. They said, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, "follow the path of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in training technical personnel from among workers," and thoroughly seize back the scientific and technological powers usurped by the bourgeois reactionary "authorities," welcoming a new industrial revolution. Revolutionary workers of the Guizhou New China Printing Factory said: In the past, China's Khrushchev fiercely promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "experts running the factory," elevating those bourgeois "technical authorities" to high positions. These people are reactionary in politics and incompetent in technology. Now we revolutionary workers have seized the technological powers, and under the guidance of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, we have successfully printed the revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" in a short time, giving China's Khrushchev and the reactionary "technical authorities" a resounding slap in the face.

The technical research room of the 3502 Factory of the General Logistics Department is composed of ordinary workers-turned-technicians and apprentices. Those bourgeois "technical authorities" sneered at them as "clothing artisans." It is these "clothing artisans" who, through the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, have successfully innovated thousands of technological projects, realizing the semi-automation and automation of clothing production, and becoming a model unit for studying Chairman Mao's works and a red flag for technological innovation in the General Logistics Department. After hearing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they consecutively held meetings to study and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions, severely criticizing China's Khrushchev's revisionist fallacies of "technology first" and "experts running the factory." They loudly said: With Mao Zedong Thought in hand, we can create any miracle in the world.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions reached the "Sea Tigers" on the front line in Fujian. The entire crew immediately enthusiastically studied them. They proudly said: We master modern technological equipment, sinking the American and Kuomintang bandits' "Tujiang" and "Yongchang" warships, not relying on any regular training from military technical schools, but relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and our limitless loyalty to Chairman Mao. They said, let China's Khrushchev's fallacies of relying on bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" go to hell! We will forever follow the great course charted by Chairman Mao, ride the winds and break the waves, and forge ahead!

The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Luogang Bridge People's Commune in Beijing, while studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, angrily criticized China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational line. They said, in the past, we could not enter the doors of universities, and the scientific and technological powers were usurped by bourgeois intellectuals. They turned scientific research into a means for personal fame and profit, hindering the development of production. Chairman Mao's latest instructions have spoken the words we have wanted to say for many years. Only by acting according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions can we foster a proletarian scientific and technological team.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions have pushed the revolutionary criticism in many colleges and universities across the country to a new high. Revolutionary teachers and students of Zhengzhou Institute of Technology, while denouncing China's Khrushchev, said, in the past, as soon as we entered the university gates, bourgeois "professors" and "authorities" would preach to us about "training goals of engineers and senior technical personnel," making us walk a path detached from workers and peasants and practical struggles from the beginning. After graduation, we sought fame and profit, wanted positions, truly the more we learned, the more stupid we became, the more we learned, the more revisionist we became. Members of the Revolutionary Committee of Guangxi Education Institute and Red Guards, revolutionary teachers and staff said, intellectuals must unite with the workers and peasants, thoroughly transform their worldviews, and catch up with the magnificent strides of the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people.

Representatives of the Red Guard Congress of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region said at a rally of 20,000 people in Yinchuan City, China's Khrushchev fiercely opposed and resisted Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, vigorously promoting and implementing the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, using "fame and fortune" as bait, attempting to train us young people into "spiritual aristocrats" detached from proletarian politics, reality, and the masses, serving his evil conspiracy to restore capitalism. We, the Red Guards of Chairman Mao, will resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and vow to carry the educational revolution to completion.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "How do we judge whether a young person is a revolutionary? What standard do we use? What do we use to distinguish them? There is only one standard, that is, whether they are willing and whether they actually unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants." Revolutionary young people across the country, while studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, resolutely expressed their determination to follow the path of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers as indicated by Chairman Mao, go to the countryside, go to the mines, go to the grassroots, go to the frontier, be workers and peasants for life, get covered in oil and dirt, and be reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

In a part of the production brigades of the Xilin Gol League in Inner Mongolia, where Beijing and Hohhot Red Guards have collectively settled down, they had a heated discussion on Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the grasslands. They said, Chairman Mao's latest instructions have made our direction clearer, our determination stronger, and our steps firmer. Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the great policy for training and fostering millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, a long-term plan for ensuring that our Party and state will never change color. We must defend and implement Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment with actual actions.

Revolutionary teachers and students of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary College of Qinghai University expressed at a study meeting: Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the great order to wage a thorough battle against the revisionist educational line. Go to the pastoral areas, go to the poor herdsmen, this is our battle oath. Graduates of the Class of 1966 who have not yet been assigned jobs at Anhui Medical College all expressed their determination to listen to Chairman Mao's words, resolutely go to the countryside, take the broad poor and lower-middle peasants as teachers, start everything from scratch, temper themselves in practice, and cultivate themselves into doctors who completely and thoroughly serve the people in the countryside.

Revolutionary teachers, students, and graduates of colleges and universities in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Jilin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, Ningxia, Gansu, Xinjiang, and other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, while studying and discussing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, also expressed their determination with great excitement: Go to the countryside, go to the mines, go to the frontier, go to the grassroots, go to the most difficult and harsh places, unite with the workers and peasants, this is the great crucible for training successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Only in this great crucible can we forge a clear proletarian stance, firm proletarian will, strong labor viewpoint, and solid feelings for workers, peasants, and soldiers. We must, in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, transform our worldviews and quickly make ourselves truly proletarian intellectuals with socialist consciousness, culture, and practical experience, and quickly catch up with the magnificent strides of the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people.

    十年前，我们的伟大领袖毛主席，为我国一个自力更生的工厂亲笔写下了光辉的题词：“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”。今天，当这个厂的革命工人读到毛主席的最新指示时，他们的心情很激动，热烈欢呼毛主席的伟大指示，又一次把几千年来剥削阶级所谓

    山西省著名的全国农业劳动模范吴春安学习了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，兴奋地说，毛主席的最新指示字字句句说到了贫下中农的心坎里。他说，万恶的旧社会，把我们劳动人民关在大学门外；解放以后，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，疯狂地抵制毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，还是把我们广大的劳动人民关在大学门外，毛主席的最新指示，把大学的门完全向我们打开了，把被颠倒了的历史翻过来了！翻得好，翻得好极了！我们贫下中农一千个欢呼，一万个拥护！毛主席的最新指示是我们开展教育革命的指路明灯，是青年学生同工农兵相结合的指路明灯。照毛主席的伟大指示办大学，“从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去”，这样的大学，培养出的学生思想红，能劳动，能文能武，我们贫下中农最支持办这样的大学，最需要这样的大学生。
    战斗英雄麦贤得一遍又一遍地从广播中收听了毛主席的最新指示。他说，毛主席的最新指示，是彻底埋葬中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线的战斗号角。我们一定要认真学习，深刻领会，坚决贯彻毛主席的最新指示，把中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线批深批透，将无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
    东南一个钢铁厂里有一位由贫农放牛娃成长起来的技术员，他怀着一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，在我国钢铁工业方面作出了重大贡献。他解放前只读过一年半初小，就失学回家给地主放牛种田。是毛主席把他从火坑里救了出来，培养他成为红色的技术员。他学习了毛主席的最新指示以后说，不管以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的反革命修正主义教育路线过去怎样压制我们贫下中农出身的孩子，我一想到有毛主席给我撑腰，就决心为毛主席争气。在无产阶级文化大革命的阶级斗争大风大浪里，我终于冲破重重困难，在抓革命、促生产的伟大斗争中作出了一些贡献。毛主席的最新指示说：“要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路”，我坚决拥护，坚决照办！
      “毛主席的最新指示，是培养无产阶
  级革命事业接班人的指路明灯，好得很，
  好极了！”
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”广大工农兵群众和红卫兵小将重温毛主席这一伟大教导，对毛主席的最新指示有了更深刻的理解。他们说，毛主席的最新指示，是培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业接班人的指路明灯，是反修防修的百年大计，好得很，好极了！
    空军某部四好飞行大队许多思想红、技术高的飞行员同志，都是从战士中选拔出来的。他们对毛主席、对党的无产阶级感情最深厚。他们从战争中学习战争，在实践中锻炼提高，很快就掌握了凌空歼敌的飞行技术，为保卫祖国的领空贡献着自己的力量。他们在座谈会上指出，毛主席的最新指示，为培养无产阶级革命事业接班人指出了根本方向和途径，是反修防修的百年大计，具有极其深远的伟大意义。按照毛主席的伟大指示培养出来的大学生，来自于工农，服务于工农，不再是脱离无产阶级政治、脱离群众、脱离实际的“精神贵族”，我们工农兵就是信得过！
    河北省著名的全国农业劳动模范耿长锁在学习座谈会上说，伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，是无产阶级教育革命、科学技术革命的指路明灯。紧跟毛主席，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办学校，从革命斗争和生产劳动中培养无产阶级的接班人，就可以防止产生修正主义，使我们的社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色。
    天津人民汽车三厂技术研究组的汽车司机、汽车修理工人和革命青年技术人员们，在无产阶级文化大革命中冲破修正主义的种种束缚，在技术上有所创造。他们听到毛主席的最新指示后，举行了批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义科技路线的大会。老工人们在会上激动地说，我们工人阶级一定要遵照毛主席的伟大教导，学习上海机床厂的经验，为祖国社会主义革命和社会主义建设作出更大贡献。
    甘肃工业大学广大毕业生激动地说：毛主席的最新指示象光芒万丈的灯塔，照亮了我们前进的道路。我们一定响应毛主席的伟大号召，面向农村，面向边疆，面向基层，面向工矿，做工农群众的小学生，彻底改造资产阶级世界观，做无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    已经在内蒙古草原牧区落户的北京上山下乡知识青年学习了毛主席的最新指示，激动地说，毛主席的最新指示句句说到我们心坎上。我们一定要按照毛主席的最新指示，指导一切行动，在反修前哨改造一辈子世界观，斗天换地创新天，任它风大浪险，忠于毛主席的红心永不变！管它千重浪万道关，走同工农兵相结合道路的决心永不变！
    以毛主席最新指示为武器，大破修正
  主义教育路线，将教育革命进行到底！
    各地工农兵群众和红卫兵小将在学习毛主席最新指示的时候，遵照毛主席“破字当头，立在其中”的教导，对中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线和科技路线展开了进一步的深刻批判。他们表示，一定要把革命的大批判持久而深入地开展下去，让毛泽东思想、毛主席的无产阶级革命路线牢牢地占领教育战线和科技战线的一切阵地。
    在中国赫鲁晓夫曾经几次去放过毒的上海汽轮机厂，广大革命职工以毛主席的最新指示为强大武器，狠狠地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫到这个厂所兜售的修正主义黑货。他们说，我们一定遵循毛主席的教导，“走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路”，把那些被资产阶级反动技术“权威”窃踞的科学技术大权彻底地夺回到无产阶级手里，迎接新的工业革命。贵州新华印刷厂革命工人说：过去中国赫鲁晓夫拚命推行“专家治厂”等反革命修正主义路线，把那些资产阶级技术“权威”捧得高高的，这些人政治上反动，技术上不行。现在我们革命工人掌握了技术大权，在光芒万丈的毛泽东思想指引下，短短时间内就印刷成功了《毛主席去安源》的革命油画，给了中国赫鲁晓夫和反动技术“权威”一记响亮的耳光。
    总后勤部三五○二工厂技术研究室全是普通工人出身的技术人员和学徒工，那些资产阶级技术“权威”讥笑他们是“被服匠”。就是这些“被服匠”，活学活用毛泽东思想，革新成功千百个技术项目，实现了被服生产半自动化和自动化，成为总后勤部学习毛主席著作的标兵单位和技术革新的红旗。他们听到毛主席最新指示以后，接连召开了学习毛主席最新指示的讲用会，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“技术第一”、“专家治厂”等修正主义谬论。他们响亮地说：掌握了毛泽东思想，什么人间奇迹也能创造出来。
    毛主席的最新指示传到福建前线“海上猛虎艇”，全艇的指战员们立即热烈学习。他们自豪地说：我们掌握现代化的技术装备，打沉了美蒋匪帮的“沱江”号、“永昌”号两艘军舰，不是靠什么军事技术学校的正规训练，而是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠对毛主席的无限忠诚。他们说，让中国赫鲁晓夫的那套依靠资产阶级“专家”、“权威”的谬论见鬼去吧！我们就是要永远沿着毛主席所指引的伟大航道，乘风破浪，奋勇前进！
    北京芦沟桥人民公社贫下中农在学习毛主席最新指示的时候，愤怒地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线。他们说，过去大学的门我们不能进，科学技术大权被资产阶级知识分子篡夺。他们把科学研究作为个人争名夺利的途径，阻碍着生产的发展。毛主席的最新指示说出了我们多少年想说的心里话。只有按照毛主席最新指示办事，才能造就出无产阶级的科学技术队伍。
    毛主席的最新指示，使各地许多大中学校的革命大批判推向了新的高潮。郑州工学院的革命师生，在愤怒声讨中国赫鲁晓夫时说，过去一进大学门，资产阶级的“教授”、“权威”就向我们鼓吹什么“培养目标是工程师、高级技术人材”，使我们一开始走的就是脱离工农群众，脱离实践斗争的道路。毕业后，争名利，要地位，真是越学越蠢，越学越修。广西教育学院革委会的成员和红卫兵小将、革命教职员工说，知识分子必须与工农群众相结合，彻底改造自己的世界观，才能赶上亿万革命人民前进的雄伟步伐。
    宁夏回族自治区红代会的代表在银川市两万人的集会上发言说，中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂反对和抵制毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，竭力鼓吹和推行反革命修正主义的教育路线，以“成名成家”为诱饵，企图把我们青年人培养成脱离无产阶级政治，脱离实际，脱离群众的“精神贵族”，为他复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋服务。我们毛主席的红卫兵，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，誓把教育革命进行到底。
      坚决走毛主席指引的同工农兵结合
  的道路，到农村去，到工矿去，到基层
  去，到边疆去！
    毛主席教导我们：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”各地广大革命的知识青年在学习毛主席最新指示的时候，坚决表示要走毛主席指引的同工农兵结合的道路，到农村去，到工矿去，到基层去，到边疆去，当一辈子工人农民，沾一身油污，滚一身泥巴，誓做无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
    在内蒙古锡林郭勒盟一部分社队集体插队落户的北京和呼和浩特的红卫兵们，在草原上对毛主席最新指示进行了热烈的讨论。他们说，毛主席的最新指示，使我们方向更明，决心更大，步伐更坚定了。毛主席的最新指示，是培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业接班人的伟大方针，是保证我们党和国家永不变色的百年大计，我们一定要以实际行动来捍卫和实现毛主席的这一伟大战略部署。
    青海大学畜牧兽医学院革命师生在学习座谈中表示：毛主席的最新指示，是号召我们同修正主义教育路线彻底决战的伟大号令。到牧区去，到贫苦牧民中去，这就是我们的战斗誓言。安徽医学院六六级还没有分配的毕业生纷纷表示，毛主席每时每刻关怀我们成长，我们一定要听毛主席的话，坚决到农村去，拜广大贫下中农为师，一切从头学起，在实践中磨练自己，把自己培养成为完全彻底为人民服务的农村医生。
    北京、上海、天津、河北、江苏、浙江、山东、吉林、辽宁、黑龙江、陕西、广东、湖北、湖南、宁夏、甘肃、新疆等省、市、自治区大中学校的革命师生和应届毕业生在学习座谈毛主席的最新指示时，也无比激动地表示：到农村去，到工矿去，到边疆去，到基层去，到最困难、最艰苦的地方去，和工农群众相结合，这是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的大熔炉。只有在这个大熔炉里才能炼出鲜明的无产阶级立场，坚定的无产阶级斗志，坚强的劳动观点，牢固的工农兵感情。我们一定要在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三项伟大的革命运动中，改造世界观，尽快地使自己真正成为有社会主义觉悟、有文化、有实践经验的无产阶级知识分子，迅速赶上亿万革命人民前进的雄伟步伐。
