The Revolutionary Committee of the Seventh Middle School in Rongcheng County, Shandong Province, and the military training team stationed at the school held a study class to organize graduates to study Chairman Mao's instructions on the necessity for intellectual youth to integrate with workers and peasants. They severely criticized the revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev, focused on political and ideological work, and significantly raised the class consciousness of the graduates, who vowed to become reliable successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution.

The Revolutionary Committee of the Seventh Middle School in Rongcheng County, Shandong Province, and the military training team stationed at the school held a Mao Zedong Thought study class to organize graduates to study Chairman Mao's instructions on the necessity for intellectual youth to integrate with workers and peasants. They severely criticized the anti-revolutionary revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev, which poisons the minds of intellectual youth, significantly raising the graduates' awareness of the two-line struggle. They resolved to follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao and go to where the motherland needs them most.

The graduates of Rongcheng Seventh Middle School, after being tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have high revolutionary spirits. Most students joyfully expressed their willingness to obey the state's allocation. However, a few students, due to the poisoning of China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational line, do not fully understand the great significance of "facing the countryside, facing the border, facing the mines, and facing the grassroots" and cannot correctly handle the issue of graduation allocation. In response to this active thought, the school's Revolutionary Committee and the military training team held a Mao Zedong Thought study class for the graduates. They organized the students to study Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions on the conditions for successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause and the necessity for intellectuals to integrate with workers and peasants. They also guided everyone to connect with reality, expose their thoughts, fight against selfishness, and transform their worldview. Through the study, the majority of graduates realized that "the countryside is a vast expanse where one can achieve great things." Facing the countryside, facing the border, facing the mines, and facing the grassroots are important paths for every young person to integrate with the workers and peasants and cultivate themselves into successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. They must firmly walk this path.

To thoroughly eliminate the influence of the revisionist educational line, the Revolutionary Committee and the military training team mobilized the graduates and the revolutionary teachers and students to carry out extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism. They severely criticized the idea of prioritizing the upper levels over the grassroots, cities over the countryside, and industry over agriculture. The graduates, in conjunction with the school's examples and their own thoughts, eliminated the influence and dug out the roots of revisionism. Many graduates deeply felt that "China's Khrushchev's revisionist allocation principles are a breeding ground for cultivating young masters and misses who are detached from the working people and serve the bourgeoisie. They are a revisionist line. If we do not obey the people's needs, we will be poisoned by it and become its captives." The Revolutionary Committee and the military training team organized the graduates to study the heroic deeds of Comrade Menhe, guiding them to find gaps in the two-line struggle, trace the source of "selfishness," and carry out a revolution in the depths of their souls, raising everyone's awareness of the two-line struggle. They said, "There are thousands of gaps, but the most fundamental one is the gap in loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Only by being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao can we do everything for the public. We must, like Comrade Menhe, firmly advance along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!"

The Revolutionary Committee and the military training team of Rongcheng Seventh Middle School believed that young students, born under the red flag and raised in sweet waters, "can speak of hardships but not of their true feelings," lacking deep affection for the working people and not knowing how hard it was to achieve socialist achievements. Therefore, they conducted class education for the graduates. They led the graduates to visit the graves of revolutionary martyrs and listened to the martyrs' former comrades-in-arms introduce the martyrs' heroic deeds. At the same time, they reviewed Chairman Mao's brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Many students, with tears in their eyes, said, "The revolutionary martyrs, following Chairman Mao's battle orders, braved the wind and snow, traveled thousands of miles, from Wolf Mountain to the Yellow Sea, fought bloody battles, struck the enemy, and shed their last drop of blood for the revolution. This is because they had a heart that was infinitely loyal to the Party, to the people, and to Chairman Mao. While we revolve around 'selfishness,' this is the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao." To further raise the graduates' class consciousness, they specially invited old poor peasants to give a report on bitter memories and sweet recollections, thereby strengthening the graduates' proletarian feelings and firming their resolve to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants. Graduate Wang Shulian said, "We will forever be Chairman Mao's Red Guards and the good children of the poor and lower-middle peasants."

Through a series of political and ideological work, the graduates' proletarian consciousness was further raised, their awareness of the two-line struggle was strengthened, and their proletarian feelings for the working people were deepened. They further realized that we are Chairman Mao's Red Guards, shouldering the historical revolutionary mission. The allocation of graduates is not just a matter of organizational arrangement but a major issue of whether we are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. It is a major issue of whether we will be reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause or captives of the bourgeoisie. Everyone expressed that in the issue of graduate allocation, they must do their best to "advance when Chairman Mao waves his hand" and "do everything for Chairman Mao," responding to the great call of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao, going to the countryside, to the most difficult places, to where the motherland needs them most, to the storms and waves for tempering, to experience hardships, to see the world, and to vow to be reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    面向农村   面向边疆  面向工矿  面向基层
    到祖国最需要的地方去  在大风浪中锻炼成长
    山东省荣成县第七中学革委会和驻校军训团，举办学习班，组织毕业生学习毛主席关于知识青年必须和工农相结合的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线，大抓政治思想工作，毕业生阶级觉悟大大提高，立志做无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
    本报讯山东省荣成县第七中学革命委员会和驻校军训团，举办毛泽东思想学习班，组织毕业生学习毛主席关于知识青年必须同工农相结合的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫毒害知识青年的反革命修正主义教育路线，使毕业生大大提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，决心按照毛主席指引的道路，到祖国最需要的地方去。
    荣成七中应届毕业生，经过无产阶级文化大革命的战斗洗礼，革命斗志昂扬，大多数同学愉快地表示服从国家的分配。但是，少数同学由于受了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线的毒害，对“面向农村、面向边疆、面向工矿、面向基层”的重大意义认识不足，不能正确对待毕业分配问题。针对这种活思想，校革委会和驻校军训团在毕业生中举办毛泽东思想学习班，组织他们学习毛主席关于无产阶级革命事业接班人的条件和知识分子必须同工农相结合的光辉指示，并引导大家联系实际，亮思想，斗私心，改造世界观。通过学习，广大毕业生认识到：“农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的”，面向农村，面向边疆，面向工矿，面向基层，是每个青年与工农群众相结合，把自己培养成为无产阶级革命事业接班人的重要途径，必须坚定地走这一条路。
    为了彻底肃清修正主义教育路线的流毒，七中革委会和军训团又发动毕业生和广大革命师生广泛深入地开展革命大批判，狠揭狠批那种重上层、轻基层，重城市、轻农村，重工业、轻农业的黑货。毕业生们并结合本校实例和联系自己的思想，肃清流毒，猛挖修根。不少毕业生深有感触地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫那一套修正主义分配原则，是培养脱离劳动人民、为资产阶级服务的少爷小姐的温床，是一条修正主义路线。我们如果不服从人民的需要，就是中了它的毒，作了它的俘虏。”革委会和军训团又组织毕业生学习了门合同志的英雄事迹，引导他们在两条路线斗争问题上找差距，在“私”字上追根源，在灵魂深处闹革命，提高大家两条路线斗争觉悟。他们说：“千条差距，万条差距，最根本的一条就是在忠于毛主席革命路线的程度上有差距。只有无限忠于毛主席，才能做到事事全为公。我们要象门合同志那样，坚定不移地沿着毛主席的革命路线前进！”
    荣成七中革委会和军训团认为，青年学生生在红旗下，长在甜水里，“能言苦理，不能言苦衷”，缺乏对劳动人民的深厚感情，不知道社会主义江山来之不易。于是，他们又对毕业生进行阶级教育。他们带领毕业生瞻仰革命烈士墓，并听取了烈士生前的战友介绍烈士英雄事迹，同时重温了毛主席的光辉著作《为人民服务》。许多同学眼含热泪说：“革命烈士遵照毛主席的战斗命令，顶风冒雪，长途跋涉数千里，从狼牙山来到黄海之滨，浴血奋战，打击敌人，为革命流尽了最后一滴血，就是因为他们胸怀一颗无限忠于党，忠于人民，忠于毛主席的红心。而我们却围绕‘私’字打转转，这是对毛主席的最大不忠。”为了进一步提高毕业生的阶级觉悟，他们还特地请苦大仇深的老贫农作忆苦思甜报告，从而增强了毕业生的无产阶级感情，坚定了向贫下中农学习的决心。毕业生王淑玲同学说：“我们要永远做毛主席的红卫兵、贫下中农的好儿女。”
    通过一系列的思想政治工作，毕业生的无产阶级觉悟进一步提高了，两条路线斗争观念增强了，对劳动人民的无产阶级感情加深了。他们进一步认识到：我们是毛主席的红卫兵，肩负着历史的革命重任。毕业生分配绝不是单纯的组织安排问题，而是一个检验我们是否无限忠于毛主席革命路线的大是大非问题，是考验我们做无产阶级革命事业接班人，还是做资产阶级俘虏兵的大问题。大家纷纷表示：在毕业分配问题上，一定要做到，“毛主席挥手我前进”，“一切服从毛主席”，响应以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的伟大号召，到农村去，到最艰苦的地方去，到祖国最需要的地方去，到大风大浪中去锻炼，经风雨，见世面，立志做无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
