Yemen annihilates two infiltrating U.S.-Saudi mercenary forces and seizes large quantities of U.S.-made weapons and ammunition

SANA, July 23 (Xinhua) — According to a report from the Yemen News Agency, the Yemeni armed forces and people's militia recently annihilated two groups of foreign mercenaries and infiltrators supported and armed by U.S. imperialism and the Saudi Arabian reactionaries in the northwestern region. They also seized a large quantity of U.S.-made weapons and ammunition.

Yemeni Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Abdul Rahman al-Iryani, announced on July 22 in the northwestern Yemeni city of Absi that the main channel used by U.S. imperialism and Saudi Arabian reactionaries to supply weapons and military supplies to mercenaries and infiltrators in the northwestern border of Yemen has been completely sealed off and is now under the complete control of the Yemeni people's militia.

He condemned the plot by U.S. imperialism and Saudi Arabian reactionaries to strangle the Yemeni revolution and the republican system, and emphasized that "the Yemeni people are fully prepared to deal with any attempts by imperialism and reactionaries."

In recent months, mercenaries supported by the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have mainly infiltrated from the north of Yemen. They have continuously received supplies of U.S.-made weapons, ammunition, and military equipment from their invasion bases in Najran and Kizan within Saudi Arabia.

Previously, the Yemeni armed forces and people's militia had already cleared the mercenaries who had infiltrated the Sana'a-Hodeidah road, seizing a large quantity of U.S.-made weapons and ammunition. The Yemeni armed forces continue to strike at the remnants on both sides of the road, recently capturing a foreign mercenary in Nakil Yaslih south of Sana'a.

    也门歼灭两股入侵的美—沙雇佣军
    并缴获大量美制武器和弹药
    新华社萨那二十三日电　据也门通讯社报道：也门武装部队和人民军，最近在西北部地区歼灭了两股由美帝国主义和沙特阿拉伯反动派支持和武装的外国雇佣军和渗入分子，并缴获了大量的美制武器和弹药。也门总理兼武装部队总司令阿姆里二十二日在也门西北重镇阿卜西宣布说，被美帝国主义和沙特阿拉伯反动派用来向雇佣军和渗入分子输送武器和军需品的主要渠道的也门西北部边境，已经全部封锁，并已由也门人民军所完全控制。
    他谴责美帝国主义和沙特阿拉伯反动派阴谋扼杀也门革命和共和制度，并强调指出，“也门人民已经作好一切准备，以便对付帝国主义和反动派的任何企图。”
    近几个月来，由美沙支持的雇佣军主要是从也门北部入侵的。他们从位于沙特阿拉伯境内的纳杰兰和基赞的侵略基地，不断获得美制武器、弹药和军用品的供应。
    前些时候，也门武装部队和人民军已经肃清了入侵到萨那—荷台达公路的雇佣军，缴获了大量美制武器和弹药。也门武装部队继续打击公路两侧的残敌，最近在萨那以南的纳基勒·雅斯利赫，俘虏了一名外国雇佣军。
