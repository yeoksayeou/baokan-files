In the course of advancing victoriously along the path of socialist revolution and socialist construction, the broad masses of members of agricultural production cooperatives in Albania, after securing a bumper wheat harvest this year, are enthusiastically selling state and surplus grain to the state.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Tirana, under the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labour headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the broad masses of members of agricultural production cooperatives in Albania have undergone tempering through the revolutionary movement, greatly enhanced their socialist consciousness, actively leveraged human factors, and striven to overcome unfavorable weather conditions. As a result, this year's wheat production has reached an all-time high. The total wheat production of the agricultural production cooperative in the suburbs of Tirana is expected to be more than 2,200 metric tons higher than the planned figure for 1970. The wheat yield per unit area in areas such as Lushnje and Fier generally exceeds the planned target, with an expected increase of four to five metric tons per hectare compared to last year.

Currently, many agricultural production cooperatives are busy threshing and delivering the first batch of the most plump new wheat to the state. Every day, trucks, horse-drawn carts, and ox-drawn carts laden with the bumper wheat harvest are continuously heading towards the state procurement stations. The grain-delivering members are playing festive tunes celebrating the harvest and singing folk songs praising the Party of Labour and Comrade Enver Hoxha, joyfully arriving at the procurement stations to hand over the state grain.

This year, the speed at which various districts' agricultural production cooperatives sell state and surplus grain to the state is much faster than last year. So far, the agricultural production cooperatives in the Durres district have completed the task of delivering the state grain for the first nine months, which is one month earlier than last year, and the amount of state grain delivered is 64 percent more than last year. The members of this district have pledged to complete the task of delivering the state grain for the entire year by the end of July and to use wheat to deliver it all. Many agricultural production cooperatives in the Fier district completed the task of delivering the state grain for the first nine months of this year as early as the beginning of July and started selling surplus grain. A member of the Lenin Agricultural Production Cooperative in this district, Teqo, told a reporter, "Under the Party of Labour's guidance to increase grain production and ensure self-sufficiency in grain, our cooperative's grain production this year will reach the planned target for 1970. We not only want to complete the task of delivering the state grain ahead of schedule but also want to sell more surplus grain." Some members said, "We want to sell more state and surplus grain to strengthen the state's ability to resist imperialism and modern revisionism."

This year, the wheat sold to the state by agricultural production cooperatives in various places is not only plump but also well-dried and clean.

    积极发挥人的因素　克服气候不利条件
  　夺得今年小麦丰收阿广大农业社员踊跃向国家交售公粮余粮
    据新华社地拉那电　在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的道路上胜利前进的阿尔巴尼亚广大农业生产合作社社员，在夺得今年小麦丰收之后，踊跃向国家交售公粮和余粮。
    阿尔巴尼亚广大农业生产合作社社员，在以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，经受了革命化运动的锻炼，大大提高了社会主义觉悟，积极发挥人的因素，努力克服气候造成的不利条件，使今年的小麦产量达到了历年来的最高水平。地拉那郊区农业生产合作社的小麦总产量预计比一九七○年的计划数字还高二千二百多公担。卢什涅和费里等区的小麦单位面积产量一般都超额完成计划，预计每公顷要比去年增产四、五公担。
    现在，许多农业生产合作社正在加紧脱粒，把第一批颗粒最饱满的新麦交售给国家。每天，在各条道路上，一辆辆汽车、马车和牛车，满载着丰收的小麦，络绎不绝地驶向国家收购站。送粮的社员们奏着欢庆丰收的乐曲，唱着歌颂劳动党和霍查同志的民歌，欢欣鼓舞地来到收购站，向国家交纳公粮。
    今年，各区农业生产合作社向国家交售公粮和余粮的速度比去年大大加快。到目前为止，都拉斯区的农业生产合作社已经完成了交纳头九个月公粮的任务，这比去年提早了一个月，交的公粮也比去年多百分之六十四。这个区的社员们提出保证，要在七月底完成交全年公粮的任务，并且全部用小麦来交纳。费里区的许多农业生产合作社早在七月初就完成了今年头九个月公粮的交纳任务，并开始售余粮。这个区的列宁农业生产合作社社员特戈对记者说：“在劳动党关于增加粮食生产、保证粮食自给的教导下，我们社今年的粮食生产将达到一九七○年的计划指标。我们不仅要提前完成交公粮的任务，而且要多卖余粮。”还有些社员说，我们要多交售公粮和余粮，使国家增强反对帝国主义和反对现代修正主义的力量。
    今年，各地农业生产合作社向国家交售的小麦，不仅颗粒饱满，而且晒得干、扬得净。
