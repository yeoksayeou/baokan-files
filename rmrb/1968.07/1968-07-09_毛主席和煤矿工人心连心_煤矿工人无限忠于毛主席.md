Representatives attending the national coal industry conference on revolutionizing and promoting production highly praised the revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" as a bountiful fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the arts.

Xinhua News Agency, July 8th: Representatives of China's coal industry, who have been personally received by the great leader Chairman Mao twice, have been holding the revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" in their hands these days, gazing at the great leader Chairman Mao's magnificent and sublime image from his youth. Their hearts are filled with immense emotion. They shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of life to Chairman Mao!" and "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" They said, "Chairman Mao is heart-to-heart with us coal miners. We coal miners are forever loyal to Chairman Mao. We will definitely always follow Chairman Mao in revolution. We will definitely, with new achievements in revolutionizing and promoting production, repay the great leader Chairman Mao's warm care for us coal miners in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

Representatives attending the national coal industry conference on revolutionizing and promoting production unanimously highly praised the revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan." They said: The birth of this painting is a bountiful fruit of revolutionary artists resolutely implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's great policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics. It is a bountiful fruit of revolutionary artists acting according to Chairman Mao's great instruction of "using foreign things for Chinese purposes and innovating." It is also a bountiful fruit of the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This painting is excellent, excellent in that it depicts Chairman Mao's brilliant image of revolutionary practice among the workers and peasants in his youth; excellent in that it depicts the great leader Chairman Mao's boundless concern for us coal miners and our heart-to-heart connection; excellent in that it depicts our coal miners' profound proletarian feelings of boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao; excellent in that it depicts the true history of Chairman Mao going to Anshan to pioneer the workers' revolutionary movement, reversing the history that had been distorted by the great traitor and scoundrel, China's Khrushchev. They pointed out that the birth of this revolutionary oil painting is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the arts, a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

Workers from the Pingxiang Anshan Coal Mine, upon seeing the oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan," were deeply moved and could not calm down. They said, "We Anshan workers, upon seeing this revolutionary oil painting that shines with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, feel especially close and proud." In recent days, they have recalled in meetings and discussions how, in his youth, Chairman Mao braved the revolutionary storm and crossed mountains and rivers to come to Anshan multiple times, entering workers' dormitories and descending into mines, having heart-to-heart talks with workers, and spreading revolutionary truths; recalled the great leader Chairman Mao personally initiating and leading the great strike of the Anshan Railway and Mine; recalled Chairman Mao deploying the Autumn Harvest Uprising in Anshan, leading the workers' and peasants' uprising army straight to Jinggangshan, and opening up the only correct revolutionary path of surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing political power by armed force. Everyone was deeply moved in the discussion. They said: This painting is a brilliant revolutionary poem, a witness to history. It meeting with the broad revolutionary masses has made China's Khrushchev's evil plot to distort the history of Anshan workers' revolutionary struggle and build monuments for himself completely fail. The great leader Chairman Mao is the true leader of the Anshan workers' revolutionary movement. We Anshan workers will definitely always follow the great leader Chairman Mao, learn from Chairman Mao's fearless revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win; learn from Chairman Mao's revolutionary will to fear no violence and avoid no hardships for the cause of human liberation; learn from Chairman Mao's revolutionary style of hard work, simplicity, caring for the masses, and connecting with the masses, inherit and carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition that Chairman Mao personally cultivated in Anshan, and let the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought forever shine on Anshan Mountain. To inherit and carry forward the revolutionary tradition that Chairman Mao personally cultivated in Anshan, a memorial hall is now being built in this mining area to commemorate Chairman Mao's revolutionary activities in Anshan. The representatives excitedly said, Chairman Mao is forever heart-to-heart with us miners. Chairman Mao is forever our revolutionary guide. China's Khrushchev wants to distort history, but we will never allow it. We will definitely let the great leader Chairman Mao's sublime image forever stand on Anshan Mountain.

"In the old society, the mines were filled with sorrowful songs, the miners' blood and tears stained the rivers and mountains. Only coal carts were seen running every day, but few miners were seen alive." Many old coal miners who suffered greatly in the old society gazed at the painting of Chairman Mao's brilliant image for a long time, their hearts filled with emotion and tears streaming down. They said, Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! In the old society, we were cursed as "coal blackies" by the capitalist bloodsuckers. Under your leadership, we have become the masters of the state today. Now we are gathered around you, how can we not shout loudly: Socialism is good! Proletarian dictatorship is good! Mao Zedong Thought is good!

As early as the first domestic revolutionary war period, Chairman Mao highly praised the strike struggles of the Kaiping and Jiaozuo coal miners in his brilliant work "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society." The representatives of these two coal mines, upon seeing the revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan," were particularly moved. They said, for the liberation struggle of the Chinese working people, in 1921, Chairman Mao came to Anshan, igniting the blazing revolutionary fire. Chairman Mao opened up the victorious path for the liberation struggle of the Chinese people. Our revolutionary struggles in the Kaiping and Jiaozuo coal mines were developed under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao highly praised the revolutionary spirit of our working class, and in the first volume of his magnum opus, he wisely pointed out: "The industrial proletariat is the leading force of our revolution." Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts have given us boundless strength, always inspiring us to advance bravely on the revolutionary road. An old worker who has worked in the Jiaozuo Coal Mine for nearly thirty years, after seeing the oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan," felt even closer to Chairman Mao and even more hatred for China's Khrushchev. He said, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are the great savior of our working class, you are the brightest red sun in our hearts. You are forever connected with our miners' hearts. Your kindness to us is as high as the sky and as deep as the sea. With your wise leadership, we have the happy present of coal miners. China's Khrushchev wants to restore capitalism in China, making us workers suffer twice and endure twice the hardships, this is a foolish dream, it is absolutely impossible. We will definitely always follow Chairman Mao in revolution."

"Chairman Mao is the most caring to miners, we must follow Chairman Mao the closest." This is the heartfelt voice of the coal miners' representatives after seeing the oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan." Miners from the coal capital of Fushun, upon seeing the oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan," immediately recalled the scene of the beloved leader Chairman Mao inspecting Fushun. It was in the spring of 1958, our hearts' red sun, Chairman Mao, radiant and full of vigor, came to the Fushun open-pit coal mine. It was under Chairman Mao's guidance that Fushun Coal Mine presented a scene of a thousand horses galloping, achieving unprecedented miraculous results. Two workers who had personally seen Chairman Mao in the Fushun mining area gazed at the oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan," deeply moved, saying: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Looking back at the victorious course of the Chinese revolution, which step was not personally guided by you; opening the annals of the Chinese revolution, which chapter does not shine with your great thoughts! Today, at the crucial moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you, old leader, have received us twice, pointing out the direction for us to advance. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We will always follow you, we will always be loyal to you. We will definitely turn your care for miners into great strength, grasp the revolution, promote production, create new achievements for the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly in the sky of the coal capital Fushun.

Representatives of the coal exploration teams active in the Xianggan area, upon seeing the oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan," were all extremely excited. They said, we must take this painting back and give it to every exploration team member and every family member of the workers, so that they can see Chairman Mao every day and always feel that Chairman Mao is by our side. They said, we will follow Chairman Mao's wise instructions, find rich coalfields in Jiangnan, and let the coalfields of Jiangnan make greater contributions to the great socialist motherland.

Revolutionary worker representatives attending the national coal industry conference on revolutionizing and promoting production received profound education and great inspiration from the revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan." With their profound proletarian feelings of boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, they studied Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions more seriously during the conference, studied the instructions of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and decided to hold the conference well. They also expressed that after returning to the mines, they would strive to fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, carry out the spirit of the conference, grasp the revolution, promote production, and play a leading role. They said, we coal miners will definitely always be loyal to Chairman Mao, always loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, always loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and are determined to study Chairman Mao's works for life, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, like Comrade Meng He, always think of Chairman Mao, always follow Chairman Mao, always for Chairman Mao, and always be good miners for Chairman Mao.

    新华社八日讯　连续两次受到伟大领袖毛主席亲切接见的我国煤炭工业战线的职工代表，这几天，人人手捧《毛主席去安源》的革命油画，瞻仰着伟大领袖毛主席青年时代的伟大、崇高的形象，心情万分激动。他们千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”他们说，毛主席和我们煤矿工人心连心，我们煤矿工人永远忠于毛主席，我们一定永远紧跟毛主席干革命，一定在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，用抓革命促生产的新成就，报答伟大领袖毛主席对我们煤矿工人的亲切关怀。
    出席全国煤炭工业战线抓革命、促生产会议的代表，一致高度赞扬《毛主席去安源》这幅革命的油画。他们说：这幅油画的诞生，是革命的美术工作者坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席关于文学艺术为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务这一伟大方针的丰硕成果，是革命的美术工作者按照毛主席“洋为中用、推陈出新”的伟大指示办事的丰硕成果，也是史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。这幅油画好得很，好极了。好就好在画出了毛主席青年时代深入工农群众进行伟大革命实践的光辉形象；好就好在画出了伟大领袖毛主席对我们煤矿工人的无限关怀，和我们煤矿工人心连心；好就好在画出了我们煤矿工人对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情；好就好在画出了毛主席去安源开拓工人革命运动的真实历史，把被中国赫鲁晓夫这个大叛徒、大工贼颠倒了的历史又颠倒了过来。他们指出，这幅革命油画的诞生，是毛主席的革命文艺路线的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    来自萍乡安源煤矿的工人代表，看到《毛主席去安源》的油画以后，激动的心情久久不能平静。他们说：“我们安源工人看到了这幅闪耀着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的革命油画，感到格外亲切，非常自豪。”连日来，他们在座谈会和讨论会上，回忆毛主席在青年时代，迎着革命的急风暴雨，跋山涉水，多次来到安源，进工棚，下矿井，同工人促膝谈心，传播革命真理的动人情景；回忆伟大领袖毛主席当年亲自发动和领导安源路矿大罢工的战斗场面；回忆毛主席在安源部署秋收起义，率领工农起义军直上井冈山，开辟了农村包围城市，武装夺取政权的唯一正确的革命道路。大家在座谈中，心情万分激动。他们说：这幅油画是光辉的革命诗篇，是历史的见证。她同广大革命群众见面，使中国赫鲁晓夫篡改安源工人革命斗争历史、为自己树碑立传的罪恶阴谋彻底破产。伟大领袖毛主席才是安源工人革命运动的真正领袖。我们安源工人一定要永远紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，学习毛主席敢于斗争、敢于胜利的大无畏的革命气概；学习毛主席为了人类解放事业，不畏强暴，不避艰险的革命意志；学习毛主席艰苦朴素，关心群众，联系群众的革命作风，继承和发扬毛主席当年在安源亲自培育的光荣革命传统，让毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉永远普照安源山。为了继承和发扬毛主席在安源亲自培育的革命传统，现在这个矿区正在建设一座当年毛主席在安源进行革命活动的纪念馆。代表们激动地说，毛主席永远和我们矿工心连心，毛主席永远是我们革命的带路人。中国赫鲁晓夫妄想颠倒历史，我们一万个不答应。我们一定要让伟大领袖毛主席的崇高形象永远屹立在安源山上。
      “昔日矿山悲歌多，矿工血泪染山河，只见煤车天天走，不见矿工几个活。”在旧社会受尽苦难的许多煤矿老工人，久久凝望着油画上毛主席的光辉形象，激情满怀热泪流，千言万语涌心头。他们说，毛主席啊，毛主席！在旧社会，我们被吃人的资本家骂为“煤黑子”。在您的领导下，今天我们成了国家的主人。现在我们正欢聚在您的身旁，我们怎能不高声欢呼：社会主义好！无产阶级专政好！毛泽东思想好！
    早在第一次国内革命战争时期，毛主席就在《中国社会各阶级的分析》这篇光辉著作中，高度赞扬过开滦和焦作煤矿矿工的罢工斗争。这两个煤矿的代表看到革命油画《毛主席去安源》，心情格外激动。他们说，为了中国工农劳苦大众的翻身解放，一九二一年毛主席就风尘仆仆来到安源，点燃了熊熊的革命烈火。毛主席为我们全国人民的解放斗争，开辟了胜利的航道。我们开滦和焦作煤矿当年的革命斗争，就是在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下发展起来的。毛主席高度赞扬我们工人阶级的革命精神，在雄文四卷的第一篇中就英明地指出：“工业无产阶级是我们革命的领导力量。”毛主席的光辉思想，给了我们无穷的力量，一直鼓舞着我们在革命道路上奋勇前进。一位在焦作煤矿工作了近三十年的老工人，看了《毛主席去安源》的油画后，越看越感到对毛主席亲，越看越激起了对中国赫鲁晓夫的恨。他说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！您是我们工人阶级的大救星，您是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。您和我们矿工的心永远连在一起。您老人家对我们的恩情比天高，比海深。有了您的英明领导，才有煤矿工人幸福的今天。中国赫鲁晓夫妄图在中国复辟资本主义，要我们工人吃二遍苦，受二茬罪，这是痴心妄想，一千个办不到，一万个办不到。我们一定永远跟着毛主席干革命。”
    “毛主席对矿工最亲，我们要跟毛主席最紧。”这是看了《毛主席去安源》的油画之后，煤矿工人代表们发自内心的共同心声。来自煤都抚顺的矿工，看到《毛主席去安源》的油画，立刻想起了敬爱的领袖毛主席到抚顺视察的情景。那是在一九五八年的春天，我们心中的红太阳毛主席，神采奕奕，容光焕发，来到抚顺露天煤矿。就是在毛主席的指引下，抚顺煤矿出现了万马奔腾的大跃进局面，创造出了前人想都不敢想的惊人成就。当年在抚顺矿区亲眼见到过毛主席的两位工人凝望着《毛主席去安源》的油画，无比激动地说：毛主席啊，毛主席！回忆中国革命的胜利航程，哪一步不是您亲手指引；翻开中国革命的史册，哪一章不闪耀着您伟大思想的光辉！今天，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，您老人家又两次接见了我们，为我们指出了前进的方向。毛主席啊，毛主席！我们永远跟着您，我们永远忠于您。我们一定把您对矿工的关怀，化成巨大的力量，狠抓革命，猛促生产，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设立新功，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗永远飘扬在煤都抚顺的上空。
    活跃在湘赣地区的煤田地质勘探队的代表，看到《毛主席去安源》的油画，个个兴奋异常。他们说，我们一定要把这幅画带回去，送给每一个勘探队员，每一个职工家属，让他们天天看到毛主席，时刻感到毛主席就在我们身边。他们说，我们遵循毛主席的英明指示，在江南找到了丰富的煤田，让江南地区的煤田，对伟大的社会主义祖国作出更大的贡献。
    出席全国煤炭工业战线抓革命、促生产会议的革命职工代表，从《毛主席去安源》这幅革命油画中受到了深刻的教育，得到了巨大的鼓舞。他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，在会议期间，更加认真地学习毛主席的一系列最新指示，学习以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的指示，决心把会议开好，并且表示在回矿以后，要为全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，为贯彻会议精神，为狠抓革命，猛促生产，发挥骨干带头作用。他们说，我们煤矿工人一定永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，决心一辈子活学活用毛主席著作，照毛主席的指示办事，象门合同志那样，一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席，永远做毛主席的好矿工。
