The leadership cadre and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants of the Fifth Brigade of Sha Hai People's Commune in Hangjin Hou Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, take class struggle as the key, and establish various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle, closely combining study classes, criticism and struggle, and struggle against the enemy. Their methods have achieved immediate results. Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized, the revolutionary masses' awareness of class struggle and the two-line struggle has greatly increased, and the revolution and production have been powerfully promoted to victory.

The great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "Establishing study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." The leadership cadre of the Fifth Brigade acted promptly, leading the commune members to establish various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes according to local conditions and the times. Except for the five types of people, regardless of gender or age, as long as they have the ability to study, everyone participated in the study. The leadership cadre of the brigade believes that although the work of the agricultural people's commune production brigade is complex, the most fundamental thing is to use the great Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and adhere to the socialist direction. Therefore, when leading the masses to establish study classes, they emphasize taking the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in rural areas as the key, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods of China's Khrushchev and his agents, eliminating their poison, and consolidating the socialist position in rural areas. They study one of Chairman Mao's teachings on a certain aspect in the study class, criticize one of China's Khrushchev's fallacies on one aspect, and make the study class rich in content and profound in thought.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Fifth Brigade had a bitter history of suffering in each household before liberation. At that time, out of a hundred households, more than eighty households worked for a local big landlord and fake county councilor, suffering from the exploitation of the exploiting class. This history of blood and tears in each household is the most practical and profound material for deepening the understanding of Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle" and criticizing China's Khrushchev's theory of "exploitation is meritorious." In the study class, the broad masses of commune members study Chairman Mao's teachings, recall these bitter histories, hold remembrance meetings, and eat remembrance meals. The more they study and recall, the more they hate the class exploitation and oppression of the old society, and the closer their hearts are to Chairman Mao.

After liberation, the exploiting class was overthrown, but does class struggle still exist? In various study classes, everyone studied Chairman Mao's teaching with this question in mind: "In the historical stage of socialism, there still exist classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, and there is a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads." Based on Chairman Mao's teaching, the broad masses of cadres and commune members recalled the sabotage and destructive activities of class enemies within the brigade since liberation. Cadres and commune members used the criminal activities of class enemies to compare with China's Khrushchev's theory of "class struggle extinguished," and immediately saw through this extremely reactionary black talk. Through studying, recalling, and comparing, the broad masses of commune members and cadres' class awareness and class struggle consciousness reached an unprecedented height. With full class hatred, they criticized China's Khrushchev and his agents from above and fought against the local untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists from below. They supervised the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in field labor, and held fieldhead criticism meetings during rest periods, exposing and criticizing the counter-revolutionary activities of these class enemies face to face, and using the counter-revolutionary crimes of class enemies to fiercely criticize China's Khrushchev's theory of "class struggle extinguished." In the process of fierce exposure and criticism, they uncovered a batch of deeply hidden class enemies, further consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat.

In various types of study classes and criticism meetings, the leadership cadre of the brigade organized the broad masses of commune members to deeply study Chairman Mao's teachings of "if socialism does not occupy the position in rural areas, capitalism will necessarily occupy it" and "socialism is the only way out for China," and recall the history of the struggle between the two roads in rural areas over the past decade. In the process of recalling, they used Chairman Mao's teachings as a weapon to peel off the layers of class enemies and carry out deep criticism. When recalling the situation before agricultural cooperation, the poor and lower-middle peasants presented a large amount of facts, explaining that the road of individual farming is a dead end where a few people get rich and the vast majority suffer. When recalling the period of temporary economic difficulties caused by three years of natural disasters, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants had a deeper experience. In those years, China's Khrushchev, in collaboration with the international anti-China chorus, fiercely attacked people's communes, shouting "agriculture should retreat sufficiently," and vigorously advocating "three autonomies and one contract" and "four freedoms." For a time, the spontaneous capitalist forces in the Fifth Brigade rose significantly, and the collective economy suffered great losses.

Through studying, recalling, and criticizing, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants criticized China's Khrushchev's black goods of restoring capitalism, such as "three autonomies and one contract," to the point of being unbearable. Some commune members who were deeply influenced by these black talks also woke up, actively criticized capitalist thoughts, and fiercely fought against the "self" in their minds. Their spiritual world was greatly liberated, and they firmly decided to take the socialist road.

Aiming at the spread of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods in the brigade, the leadership cadre of the Fifth Brigade organized the commune members to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings of "learning agriculture from Dazhai" and "political work is the lifeline of all economic work" in the study classes, and mobilized the masses to carry out a great criticism of China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies. Through studying, the broad masses of commune members raised their awareness and consciously resisted the poison of "money as the commander," "material incentives," and "work points as the commander." Whenever they discovered the spread of these fallacies, they criticized and eliminated them. Once, the third team was pulling carts in the field to rush the accumulation of fertilizer. A few commune members shouted while pulling: "Pull quickly, work hard, earn more work points." The poor and lower-middle peasants and the cadre comrades of the leadership cadre promptly seized this active thought, organized a fieldhead criticism meeting during the work break, and carried out a special criticism of China's Khrushchev's revisionist black goods of "work points as the commander" and "material incentives." The poor and lower-middle peasants' criticism of China's Khrushchev made those few commune members suddenly realize that they had indeed been poisoned by China's Khrushchev, and the "self" in their minds had not been completely eradicated.

Fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev's black goods of "money as the commander" and "material incentives" made the broad revolutionary masses of the Fifth Brigade's revolutionary spirit greatly flourish. They, based on the extensive and in-depth development of learning from Dazhai, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to break and establish, established a Dazhai-style labor management system that highlights Mao Zedong Thought, implemented Dazhai's "standard work points," and the broad masses of commune members worked wholeheartedly for the public and everything for the public. The entire brigade presented a vigorous and lively new situation.

At present, the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the entire brigade is deeply developing, the thought of farming for the revolution is being universally established, the socialist position in rural areas is more consolidated, and the socialist collective economy is thriving.

    五四大队以阶级斗争为纲大办毛泽东思想学习班收到立竿见影效果
    毛泽东思想空前普及　人的精神面貌焕然一新
    革命大批判深入开展　社会主义阵地更加巩固
    据新华社呼和浩特三十日电　内蒙古自治区杭锦后旗沙海公社五四大队的领导班子和广大贫下中农，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以阶级斗争为纲，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，深入持久地开展革命大批判，把学习班、大批判、对敌斗争紧密结合起来。他们的办法收到了立竿见影的效果，毛泽东思想得到了大普及，革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，有力地推动了革命和生产的胜利前进。
    伟大领袖毛主席英明地指出：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”五四大队的领导班子闻风而动，领导社员因地因时制宜地办起了干部班、干部家属班、老年班、妇女班、青年班、学大寨班等各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。全大队除了五类分子外，不论男女老少，凡有学习能力的都参加了学习。大队领导班子认为，农村人民公社生产大队的工作尽管千头万绪，但是最根本的一条，就是用伟大的毛泽东思想统帅一切，巩固无产阶级专政，坚持社会主义方向。因此在领导群众大办学习班的时候，他们强调以农村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争为纲，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的反革命修正主义黑货，肃清其流毒，以巩固农村社会主义阵地。他们在学习班里学习毛主席的一个有关方面的教导，批中国赫鲁晓夫一个方面的谬论，把学习班办得内容丰富，思想深刻。
    五四大队的贫下中农，在解放前，家家户户都有一本血泪斑斑的苦难史，那时候，一百来户人家中，就有八十多户给当地的一个大恶霸地主、伪县参议员揽工受苦，受尽了剥削阶级的压榨。这一本本血泪斑斑的家史，是加深理解毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导和批判中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”论最实际、最深刻的材料。在学习班里，广大社员学习毛主席的教导，回忆这些苦难史，开忆苦会，吃忆苦饭，越学越忆，对旧社会的阶级剥削和阶级压迫越恨，心跟毛主席贴得越紧。
    解放后，剥削阶级被推翻了，阶级斗争还存在不存在？在各种学习班里，大家带着这个问题学习毛主席的教导：“在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争”。根据毛主席的这一教导，广大干部社员回忆了解放以来大队内阶级敌人的捣乱、破坏活动。干部、社员用阶级敌人的罪恶活动一对照中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，马上就看穿了这是反动透顶的黑话。一学、一忆、一对照，广大社员和干部阶级觉悟和阶级斗争观念空前提高。他们怀着满腔的阶级仇恨，上批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，下斗本村没有改造好的地富反坏右分子。他们监督地富反坏右分子在田间劳动，中间休息就开田头批判会，一边面对面地揭发和批判这些阶级敌人的反革命活动，一面用阶级敌人的反革命罪行狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。他们在狠揭狠批的过程中，又清理出一批隐藏较深的阶级敌人，进一步巩固和加强了无产阶级专政。
    在各种类型的学习班和批判会上，大队领导班子组织广大社员深入学习了毛主席“对于农村的阵地，社会主义如果不去占领，资本主义就必然会去占领”和“社会主义是中国的唯一的出路”等教导，回忆十几年来农村两条道路的斗争史。在回忆过程中，他们以毛主席的教导为武器，对阶级敌人层层剥皮，深入批判。回忆农业合作化前的情景时，贫下中农拿出了大量的事实，说明单干的道路是一条少数人发财，绝大多数人受苦的绝路。回忆由于三年自然灾害而造成的暂时经济困难时期，广大贫下中农的体验更深刻。那几年，中国赫鲁晓夫配合国际上的反华大合唱，大肆攻击人民公社，叫嚷“农业要退够”，竭力鼓吹“三自一包”、“四大自由”，一时间五四大队的资本主义自发势力大大抬头，集体经济受到了很大损失。
    通过学、忆、批，广大贫下中农把中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的“三自一包”等黑货批得臭不可闻，原来受这些黑话影响较深的一些社员，也猛省过来，主动批判了资本主义思想，狠斗了头脑中的“私”字，精神世界得到了大解放，坚定了走社会主义道路的决心。
    针对中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义黑货在本队的流毒，五四大队领导班子组织社员在学习班里反复学习毛主席“农业学大寨”、“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，发动群众对中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论展开大批判。广大社员通过学习，提高了觉悟，自觉地起来抵制“金钱挂帅”、“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”的流毒，发现这些谬论的流毒，就予以批判、肃清。一次，三队在田间拉车突击积肥，有几个社员边拉边喊：“快快拉，加油干，快拉多把工分赚。”贫下中农和领导班子的同志及时抓住了这个活思想，在工间休息时组织了田头批判会，对中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货又进行了专题批判。贫下中农对中国赫鲁晓夫的批判，使那几个社员猛吃一惊，认识到自己确实是中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒，头脑里的“私”字还没有挖净。
    狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“金钱挂帅”、“物质刺激”等黑货，使五四大队广大革命群众的革命精神大发扬。他们在广泛深入地开展学大寨的基础上，发扬敢破敢立的革命精神，建立了突出毛泽东思想的大寨式的劳动管理制度，推行了大寨的“标准工分”，广大社员一心为公，一切为公，全大队出现了一派朝气蓬勃的新气象。
    目前全大队活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动大深入，为革命种田的思想正在普遍树立，农村社会主义阵地更加巩固，社会主义集体经济蒸蒸日上。
