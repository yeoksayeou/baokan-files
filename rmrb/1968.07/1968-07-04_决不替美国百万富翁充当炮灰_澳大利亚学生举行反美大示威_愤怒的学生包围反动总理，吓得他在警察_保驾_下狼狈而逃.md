	“We Will Not Be Cannon Fodder for American Millionaires”
	Australian Students Hold Anti-American Protest
	Angry Students Surround Reactionary Prime Minister, Forcing Him to Flee Under Police Escort

	New China News Agency, Melbourne, July 3 — Hundreds of Australian students held a protest march in Sydney on the evening of July 2, opposing the conscription law that sends Australian youth to Vietnam to be cannon fodder for the U.S. aggression. The students bravely fought against the police who came to suppress them.

	This protest was held while the Australian Federal Cabinet was in session. In the evening of July 2, over six hundred students gathered outside the federal parliamentary office building, shouting slogans such as “We will not be cannon fodder for American millionaires,” “Overthrow the U.S. puppet to achieve true freedom for Australia,” and “No to conscription.”

	The students also linked arms, forming rows of ten, and stood on the sidewalk.

	When Australian Prime Minister Gorton was about to leave the office building, the police, in order to clear a path for him, attacked the students. The students bravely fought back. Some students rushed towards Gorton, while others broke through the police cordon and surrounded his car. The students kicked the car and shook it with their hands. At this point, the police started beating and kicking the students to pull them away. After a fierce struggle, Gorton’s car managed to escape. As Gorton was hurriedly escorted into the car, hundreds of people jeered and whistled at him. Some students shouted, “Resign, you are a U.S. puppet.”

	During this struggle, the police even brutally beat passersby, reporters, and photographers.

	The protesting students also held a demonstration outside the city police station to protest the police’s unjust arrest of twenty-nine students.

    “决不替美国百万富翁充当炮灰”
    澳大利亚学生举行反美大示威
    愤怒的学生包围反动总理，吓得他在警察“保驾”下狼狈而逃
    新华社墨尔本三日电　数百名澳大利亚学生二日晚上在悉尼举行游行示威，反对把澳大利亚青年送到南越去充当美国侵越战争炮灰的国民兵役法。学生们同前来镇压的警察进行了英勇的搏斗。
    这次游行示威是在澳大利亚联邦内阁正在举行会议时举行的。二日傍晚，六百多名学生聚集在联邦议会办公处的大楼外面，高呼着“我们决不替美国百万富翁充当炮灰”、“把美国傀儡赶下台，使澳大利亚取得真正的自由”、“不要征兵”等口号。
    学生们还手挽着手，排成十人一行，聚集在人行道上。
    当澳大利亚总理戈顿将走出这所办公大楼时，警察为了给戈顿开路，便向学生进行袭击，学生们英勇地进行反击。有的学生向戈顿冲去，有的学生冲破警察的警戒，围坐在戈顿汽车的周围。学生们用脚踢汽车，用手摇汽车。这时，警察就拳打脚踢地把学生拉走。经过一场激烈战斗之后，戈顿的汽车才得溜走。当戈顿狼狈地被护送上车的时候，数以百计的人向他发出嘲笑的嘘声。有的学生还对着他喊道：“要你辞职，你是美国的傀儡”。
    在这场斗争中，警察甚至还蛮横无理地殴打过路行人以及记者和摄影记者。
    示威学生们还到市警察局外面举行了示威游行，抗议警察无理逮捕了二十九名学生。
