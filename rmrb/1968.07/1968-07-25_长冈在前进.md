Longgan is a revolutionary old base area where the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong personally conducted investigations. It is a red flag that Chairman Mao himself raised over thirty years ago.

It was October 1933. The people of Longgan, with tears of joy, welcomed the great savior of the laboring people, Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao personally led the Central Inspection Team to Longgan. In the evening, he held an investigation meeting at Lenin Primary School until late at night. The next morning, he went to the rapeseed and peanut fields on Beishan Hill and labored alongside the people of Longgan. Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts and great revolutionary practices nurtured the growth of the people of Longgan. The people of Longgan followed Chairman Mao and rose up in revolution: "The people of Longgan are united, men and women join the Red Guards," "The bamboo poles are bent in rows, thousands of baskets and tens of thousands of baskets deliver public grain." In the years of war and extraordinary times, the people of Longgan, with hearts infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, created the model Longgan Township of the Soviet area. In his brilliant work "Care for the People's Livelihood, Pay Attention to Methods of Work," Chairman Mao praised them for "creating first-class work," calling them "model workers of Longgan Township, respectable workers of Longgan Township!" and urging, "Learn from Longgan Township," "Create thousands of Longgan Townships."

Over thirty years have passed. The Longgan Township of those days is now the Longgan Production Brigade of Longgan People's Commune in Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province. In the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, what new achievements have the heroic people of Longgan made? What changes have occurred?

Recently, we visited Longgan. Let us tell our revolutionary comrades with boundless excitement: The people of Longgan, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, have created new "first-class work" and have become a new model that the people of the entire province of Jiangxi are enthusiastically learning from.

The red flag of Longgan, raised by the great leader Chairman Mao, is flying high!

In the past decade, there has been a sharp struggle between two lines around the red flag of Longgan, which was personally raised by the great leader Chairman Mao. The people of Longgan wanted to hold high this red flag, but China's Khrushchev and his agents tried every means to cut down this red flag. A handful of capitalist roaders did everything they could to obstruct the people of Longgan from establishing a museum of Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practices in Longgan and to sabotage the restoration of Lenin Primary School, where Chairman Mao once held an investigation meeting. The great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, made the people of Longgan understand more clearly the past: China's Khrushchev and his agents did not allow the people of Longgan to establish a museum of Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practices, intending to cut down the red flag of Longgan personally raised by Chairman Mao and to block the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought. "Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we will fight to the death!" The people of Longgan held high the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," organizing a vast revolutionary army to expose the capitalist roaders.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the people of Longgan repeatedly recalled the scenes of Chairman Mao leading them in revolution. With boundless love for Chairman Mao and deep hatred for China's Khrushchev, they took to the stage one after another, exposing and criticizing the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in opposing Mao Zedong Thought. Questions echoed over Longgan, and big-character posters covered the streets of Longgan.

Why was it not allowed to exhibit Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practices in Longgan thirty years ago?

Why was it not allowed to restore Lenin Primary School, where Chairman Mao once held an investigation meeting?

Why did they want to cut down the red flag of Longgan personally raised by Chairman Mao thirty years ago?

Faced with a large amount of facts, the capitalist roaders had to bow their heads and confess.

The people of Longgan Township, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, decided to turn Longgan into a large classroom for the revolutionary people to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. With tears of joy, they presented the revolutionary relics they had collected for decades. The revolutionary elders gathered together, recalling Chairman Mao's affectionate instructions thirty years ago. The people of Longgan, with hearts infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, men, women, old, and young all joined hands to collect precious revolutionary materials. The "Museum of Chairman Mao's Investigation in Longgan Township," shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, was quickly built! The Lenin Primary School where Chairman Mao once held an investigation meeting was quickly restored! This is the great achievement of the people of Longgan in their heroic struggle against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party!

In Longgan, everywhere is a battlefield for criticizing China's Khrushchev. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members study a quotation from Chairman Mao during their rest time in the fields, criticize a reactionary fallacy of China's Khrushchev, and eliminate one aspect of poison. In the evening, the whole family gathers around a lamp, with the young leading the study of Chairman Mao's quotations and the elderly telling the family history to everyone. The children shout together with everyone: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Down with China's Khrushchev!"

The family criticism meeting of the poor peasant commune member Ma Lanchang, which criticized China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacy of "exploitation is beneficial," is a microcosm of Longgan's revolutionary criticism.

Ma Lanchang is the son of Ma Ronghai, whom Chairman Mao visited. At that time, Ma Ronghai's family had burned down half a house, and the township government mobilized the masses to donate money to help. Chairman Mao visited him and recorded it in his brilliant work "Care for the People's Livelihood, Pay Attention to Methods of Work." The family criticism meeting began, and Ma Lanchang's 78-year-old mother fired the first shot. She recalled how Ma Ronghai, at the age of nine, entered the door of a landlord, enduring hunger, beatings, and curses, and toiling like a beast of burden for twenty years. She angrily denounced the landlord's heinous crimes of oppressing and exploiting the poor and used her family history to criticize China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacy of "exploitation is beneficial." She said, "Exploitation is beneficial," this is what the gentry and landlords say. What benefit is there in exploitation? We say exploitation is a crime, a heinous crime! Ma Lanchang also used the contrast between his life before and after liberation to criticize China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacy of "exploitation is beneficial." He said: In the old society, it was the landlord who forced me to have nothing to eat or wear, begging for food in Taihe County. Today, under Chairman Mao's leadership, we have stood up and gained liberation, living a happy life. Not only do we have enough to eat and wear, but two of our children have also gone to middle school, and one child has entered the People's Liberation Army, this great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Today compared to the past, it is truly a world of difference. China's Khrushchev wants the landlords and gentry to ride on our heads again, restore capitalism, and make us suffer twice. This is absolutely impossible! We will definitely overthrow China's Khrushchev and make him never rise again! Ma Lanchang's four-year-old grandson, after hearing his grandfather's criticism, also widened his round eyes, raised his small fist, and shouted, "Down with China's Khrushchev!"

Through the profound criticism of China's Khrushchev's reactionary revisionist black goods such as "exploitation is beneficial" and "self-reliance, self-management, and self-sufficiency," the people of Longgan have powerfully promoted the extensive study and popularization of Mao Zedong Thought, greatly raised the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and greatly carried forward the revolutionary spirit. In Longgan, from the elderly over eighty to children five or six years old, everyone is concerned about state affairs and actively participates in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Through revolutionary criticism, the people of Longgan have four clear distinctions in their hearts: they can distinguish between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the socialist road and the capitalist road, between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and China's Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line, and between public and private. The people of Longgan, holding high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, are marching forward more firmly on the socialist road!

When China's Khrushchev was spreading the black wind of "self-reliance, self-management, and self-sufficiency," a handful of capitalist roaders, pretending to care about Longgan, said, "Longgan can only change its face by dividing land to households." The people of Longgan, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, replied, "We will definitely follow the socialist road indicated by Chairman Mao and not take the capitalist wrong path!" They smashed the black wind of "self-reliance, self-management, and self-sufficiency" and drove away the capitalist roaders. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution further inspired the revolutionary spirit of the people of Longgan. The people of Longgan deeply realized: Can the low-yield fields of Longgan leap forward? This is a sharp class struggle. They made a solemn vow: They must definitely hold high the red flag of Longgan personally raised by Chairman Mao!

In the summer of 1966, the young Communist Party member Liu Jianfa and the returned educated youth Liu Dezhu of the Longgan Brigade's Sanwang Village expressed their determination to change the face of Sanwang Village to the brigade cadres and revolutionary elders. The revolutionary elders educated them with stories of revolutionary struggle, encouraging them to follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao. The brigade cadres supported them and inspired them, saying that to change the backward face, one must start with the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works. The younger generation was overjoyed, going from door to door, and quickly organized three study groups of Chairman Mao's works with over 120 participants in the eight production teams of the Sanwang area. By comparing with Chairman Mao's instructions, everyone finally found the two fundamental reasons for Sanwang Village's backwardness: first, they did not firmly grasp the class struggle as the key link, and second, they did not fully carry forward the spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance.

There was a rich peasant element in the village who, for several years, clung to China's Khrushchev's theory of "class struggle extinction" as the Bible, spreading the black wind of "self-reliance, self-management, and self-sufficiency," sabotaging collective production, destroying the unity of the commune members, and inciting individual farming. The people of Sanwang first launched an attack on this rich peasant element, striking a heavy blow to the enemy's sabotage activities. "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." The enemy's arrogance was swept away, and the revolutionary spirit of the people of Sanwang was greatly boosted. They immediately launched an attack on the low-yield fields. They dug a two-mile-long irrigation canal in three nights with a sudden effort, built a pumping station with their own hands. Then, they dredged two large ponds that had not been dredged for decades, giving the low-yield fields a "water-rich and fertilizer-rich" treatment. The low-yield fields thus became high-yield fields, and the backward village became an advanced one.

The people of Longgan, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, struck at the class enemy, overcame nature, and achieved victory in revolution and production.

"Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Today, the people of Longgan have taken up the revolutionary glorious tradition of the past and presented a new spiritual face. This is the result of their active study and application of Chairman Mao's works and their long-term struggle against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. After Vice Chairman Lin issued the call to launch the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the Party branch secretary (now the brigade leadership group leader) Wu Caifeng heard someone saying nonsense about "peasants studying Chairman Mao's works is a waste" and "peasants studying Chairman Mao's works is formalism." Wu Caifeng thought: To protect the red flag of Longgan personally raised by Chairman Mao, we must arm the cadres and the masses with Mao Zedong Thought. No matter how the class enemy shouts, we must read Chairman Mao's books! At that time, due to the sabotage of China's Khrushchev and his agents, it was so difficult to obtain a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong"! Wu Caifeng ran around everywhere and finally obtained a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." He organized the brigade cadres to study it and then went to the production teams and households to read and explain it to the commune members. The poor and lower-middle peasants studied more and more eagerly, saying: After reading Chairman Mao's books, our hearts are redder, our eyes are brighter, and our spirits are higher. In this way, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the entire Longgan flourished. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao's works have been published and distributed in unprecedented quantities, greatly inspiring the enthusiasm of the people of Longgan to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Here, the poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members in every household have revolutionary treasures, and every team has set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Many elderly people actively requested to participate in the study classes, and the brigade cadres personally carried torches to bring them to the study classes and personally sent them back home. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Longgan said: We, the people of Longgan, will follow Chairman Mao to make revolution for generations!

The heroic people of Longgan are walking on the road of Longgan where Chairman Mao once walked, advancing victoriously in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, and striving to create new "first-class work"!

    长冈在前进
    长冈，是伟大领袖毛主席亲自作过调查的革命老根据地，是毛主席在三十多年前亲自树立的一面红旗。
    那是一九三三年的十月，长冈人民含着幸福的热泪，迎接劳动人民的大救星毛主席。毛主席亲自率领中央检查团来到长冈，晚上在列宁小学开调查会到深夜，第二天一清早又到北山坡的油菜、花生地里，同长冈人民一起参加劳动。毛主席的光辉思想、伟大革命实践，哺育着长冈人民的成长。长冈人民紧跟毛主席，起来闹革命：“长冈人民一条心，男女参加赤卫军”，“扁担弯弯一行行，千箩万筐送公粮”。战争的年代，不平常的岁月，长冈人民用一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，创造了苏区模范的长冈乡。毛主席在《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》这篇光辉著作中，表彰他们“创造了第一等的工作”，是“模范的长冈乡工作人员，可尊敬的长冈乡工作人员！”号召“要学习长冈乡”，“要造成几千个长冈乡”。
    三十多年过去了。当年的长冈乡，今日是江西省兴国县长冈人民公社长冈生产大队。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，英雄的长冈人民又建立了哪些功勋？又有了哪些变化？
    最近，我们访问了长冈。让我们以无比兴奋的心情告诉革命的同志们：无限忠于毛主席的长冈人民，又创造了新的“第一等的工作”，成为江西全省人民正在热烈学习的新的模范。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲手树立的长冈红旗高高飘扬！一
    在过去十几年里，围绕着伟大领袖毛主席亲手树立的长冈红旗，一直进行着两条路线的尖锐斗争。长冈人民要高举这面红旗，而中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，却极力想砍掉这面红旗。一小撮走资派千方百计地阻挠长冈人民在长冈建立毛主席伟大革命实践的陈列馆，破坏长冈人民修复毛主席当年开调查会的列宁小学。伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，使长冈人民更加明白了过去的一切：中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，不让长冈人民建立毛主席的伟大革命实践陈列馆，就是妄图砍倒毛主席亲手树立的长冈红旗，就是要封锁毛泽东思想的广泛传播。“毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，谁反对毛主席我们就和他拚！”长冈人民高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，组织起浩浩荡荡的革命大军，把走资派揪了出来。
    长冈人民在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，一次又一次回忆着伟大领袖毛主席当年领导他们闹革命的情景。他们怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨，一个个登上讲台，揭发、批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人反对毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。一声声质问回响在长冈上空，一张张大字报贴满了长冈街头。
    为什么不准把当年毛主席在长冈的伟大革命实践陈列出来？
    为什么不准把毛主席当年开调查会的列宁小学修好？
    为什么妄想砍倒毛主席当年亲手树立起的长冈红旗？……
    在大量的事实面前，走资派不得不低头认罪。
    无限忠于毛主席的长冈乡人民，决心把长冈办成革命人民活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂。他们含着幸福的泪花，双手捧出了收藏几十年的革命文物。革命老一代聚集在一起，回忆着三十多年前伟大领袖毛主席的亲切教导。长冈人民靠一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，男女老少齐动手，收集起宝贵的革命资料。闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的“毛泽东同志在长冈乡调查陈列馆”，很快建成了！毛主席当年开过调查会的列宁小学，很快修复了！这是长冈人民同党内一小撮走资派英勇斗争的伟大成果！二
    在长冈，到处是批判中国赫鲁晓夫的战场。广大贫下中农和社员群众，白天在田间休息的时候，学习一条毛主席语录，批判中国赫鲁晓夫一个反动谬论，肃清一个方面的流毒。晚上各家老小围在一盏灯下，青年人领着学习毛主席语录，老年人给大家讲家史。孩子们和大家一起，响亮地喊着：“毛主席万岁！”“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”
    贫农社员马兰章一家四代举行的一次批判中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”反动谬论的家庭批判会，是长冈开展革命大批判的一个缩影。
    马兰章，就是当年毛主席访问过的马荣海的儿子。那时马荣海家烧掉了一间半房子，乡政府发动群众捐钱给予帮助，毛主席访问了他，还在《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》这篇光辉著作中记载了下来。家庭批判会开始，马兰章的七十八岁的老母亲开了第一炮。她想起马荣海从九岁走进地主的门，忍饥挨饿、挨打受骂、当牛做马二十年，愤怒地控诉了地主压迫剥削穷人的滔天罪行，用家史批判了中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”的反动谬论。她说：“剥削有功”，这是豪绅、地主说的话。剥削有什么功？我们说剥削有罪，罪大恶极！马兰章也在会上用解放前后的生活对比，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”的反动谬论。他说：在旧社会是地主逼得我没有吃没有穿，讨饭到泰和县。今天，我们在毛主席领导下翻身得了解放，过着幸福的生活，不仅吃穿不愁，有两个孩子还上了中学，一个孩子进了人民解放军这所毛泽东思想的大学校。今天和过去比，真是一个天上，一个地下。中国赫鲁晓夫妄想要地主和豪绅重新骑在我们头上，复辟资本主义，让我们吃二遍苦，这一万个办不到！我们坚决把中国赫鲁晓夫打翻在地，叫他永世不得翻身！马兰章四岁的小孙孙听了爷爷的批判，也瞪着圆溜溜的小眼睛，举着小拳头喊：“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”
    长冈人民通过对中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”、“三自一包”等反革命修正主义黑货的深刻批判，有力地促进了毛泽东思想的大学习、大普及，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟大提高，革命精神大发扬。在长冈，从八十开外的老人，到五六岁的小孩子，都在关心国家大事，积极参加无产阶级文化大革命运动。通过革命大批判，长冈人民心里有四个分得清：无产阶级和资产阶级分得清，社会主义道路和资本主义道路分得清，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线分得清，公和私分得清。长冈人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加坚定地在社会主义道路上阔步前进！三
    当中国赫鲁晓夫大刮“三自一包”黑风的时候，一小撮走资派装着关心长冈的样子，说“长冈只有分田到户才能改变面貌”。用毛泽东思想武装起来的长冈人民回答说：“我们坚决走毛主席指引的社会主义大道，不走资本主义歪道！”他们粉碎了“三自一包”黑风，顶走了走资派。无产阶级文化大革命，进一步激发了长冈人民的革命精神。长冈人民深深地认识到：长冈的低产田能不能跃上去，这是一场尖锐的阶级斗争。他们立下凌云志：一定要把毛主席亲手树立的长冈红旗高举起来！
    一九六六年夏天，长冈大队泗网村的青年共产党员刘建发和回乡知识青年刘德柱等，向大队干部、革命老前辈，表达了他们要改变泗网村面貌的决心。革命前辈用革命斗争故事教育他们，鼓励他们走毛主席指引的路。大队干部支持他们，并且启发他们，改变后进面貌，要先从活学活用毛主席著作开始。年青一代兴高采烈，走门串户，很快在泗网片的八个生产队中，组织了有一百二十多人参加的三个毛主席著作学习小组。对照毛主席的教导，大家终于找出了泗网村后进的两条根本原因：一是没有狠狠抓住阶级斗争这个纲，二是没有充分发扬艰苦奋斗、自力更生的精神。
    村上有个富农分子，几年来抱着中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论当圣经唱，大肆宣扬“三自一包”，破坏集体生产，破坏社员的团结，煽动闹单干。泗网人民首先向这个富农分子发起进攻，狠狠打击了阶级敌人的破坏活动。“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”阶级敌人的威风扫地，泗网人民的革命精神大振，他们立即又向低产田展开进攻。他们用三个晚上突击挖了一条两里多长的水渠，用自己的双手建起了一个排灌站。接着，他们又把几十年来没挖过塘泥的两个大塘的塘泥挖出来，给低产田来了个“水足肥饱”，低产从此变高产，后进从此变先进。
    长冈人民就是这样靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，打击阶级敌人，战胜自然，夺取了革命和生产的胜利。四
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”今天长冈人民所以接过了当年的革命光荣传统，出现崭新的思想面貌，是他们活学活用毛主席著作，同党内一小撮走资派坚持长期斗争的结果。林副主席发出开展活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的号召后，党支部书记（现大队领导小组组长）吴才枋就听到有人胡说什么“农民学习毛主席著作是浪费”、“农民学习毛主席著作是形式主义”。吴才枋想：要保住毛主席亲手树立的长冈红旗，一定要用毛泽东思想武装干部和群众。不管阶级敌人怎么叫嚷，我们就是要读毛主席的书！那时候，由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的破坏，要得到一部《毛泽东选集》是多么不容易啊！吴才枋到处奔走，才得到了一部《毛泽东选集》。他把大队干部组织起来学习，学了以后再分头下到生产队和屋场，给社员群众边读边讲。贫下中农越学越爱学，他们说：读了毛主席的书，心更红，眼更亮，志气更高。就这样，整个长冈人民活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，就蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。无产阶级文化大革命以来，毛主席著作空前地大量出版发行，大大鼓舞了长冈人民活学活用毛主席著作的热情。在这里，贫下中农和社员群众家家有了革命宝书，队队办起了毛泽东思想学习班。许多老人积极要求参加学习班，大队干部就亲自打着火把，把他们接到学习班，又亲自送回家。长冈的贫下中农说：我们长冈人民要世世代代跟着毛主席干革命！
    英雄的长冈人民走在当年毛主席走过的长冈大路上，朝着毛主席指引的方向，乘胜前进，努力创造新的“第一等的工作”！
