Liaoning, Shaanxi, and Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committees each present Mao Zedong's works to poor and lower-middle peasants, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to new heights.

Broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants welcome the revolutionary books with immense joy, repeatedly raising their arms to shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand long live Chairman Mao!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 30th: The Liaoning Provincial Revolutionary Committee recently presented the revolutionary treasure "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the "Three Articles" to every household of poor and lower-middle peasants across the province. After receiving the revolutionary books, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, filled with profound proletarian sentiments of boundless love and loyalty towards the great leader Chairman Mao, excitedly said, "We must read Chairman Mao's books better, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to become good commune members of Chairman Mao and to do a better job in revolution and production."

On the day when the revolutionary books were presented to the poor and lower-middle peasants by various levels of revolutionary committees, from the plains to the villages, there was a wave of excitement. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants held high portraits of Chairman Mao and joyfully welcomed the decorated cars. Wherever the decorated cars went, there was the sound of drums and gongs. When the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants received the revolutionary books, they repeatedly raised their arms to shout, "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand long live Chairman Mao!" Ten years ago, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dongdajie Production Brigade in Gaokan People's Commune on the outskirts of Shenyang City, which Chairman Mao personally inspected, received the revolutionary books and, with hearts full of boundless happiness, sang "Wishing Chairman Mao Eternal Life" and "The Ship of the Great Sea Needs a Helmsman."

Various levels of revolutionary committees all regarded the presentation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary books to the poor and lower-middle peasants as a highly significant political task. Responsible comrades from various municipal, prefectural, and county revolutionary committees participated in the book presentation work. Revolutionary committees of various people's communes held celebration meetings and held solemn book presentation ceremonies. In many places, when presenting the revolutionary books, they carried out activities to praise Chairman Mao's great achievements, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and study Chairman Mao's works among the poor and lower-middle peasants and the masses of commune members. Through praising, propagating, and studying, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have an even deeper love for the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. A new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought is surging across the province's rural areas.

This joyous event greatly inspired the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and the revolutionary cadres at the grassroots level in the countryside across the province, and they are determined to push the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to new heights.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and the revolutionary cadres at the grassroots level in the countryside, with hearts full of boundless joy, carried large portraits of Chairman Mao, held high red flags, beat drums and gongs, and warmly welcomed the revolutionary books. They repeatedly shouted with unbounded joy, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand long live Chairman Mao!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" After receiving the revolutionary books, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and the revolutionary cadres at the grassroots level in the countryside excitedly said, "Chairman Mao is our poor and lower-middle peasants' great savior, and Chairman Mao's works are our poor and lower-middle peasants' lifeline. We must master Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life, and turn Shaanxi's countryside into a red Mao Zedong Thought school."

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, June 30th: To further arm the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee recently decided to present a copy of the "Three Articles" and a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to every household of poor and lower-middle peasants across the province. Currently, the vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasants across the province have received Chairman Mao's revolutionary books, and they, with hearts full of immense joy, held high Chairman Mao's revolutionary books and enthusiastically shouted:

"The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is victorious forever!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand times ten thousand long live Chairman Mao!"

Staff from Xinhua Bookstores, supply and marketing cooperatives, and transportation departments, with the highest political enthusiasm and the fastest speed, delivered the revolutionary books to the poor and lower-middle peasants. In various places, when presenting and providing the revolutionary books, they held solemn book presentation ceremonies. At the book presentation ceremonies, responsible comrades from the revolutionary committees and representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants gave impassioned speeches, expressing their profound proletarian sentiments of boundless love and loyalty towards our great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and severely criticized the crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in this region and unit who obstructed and sabotaged the poor and lower-middle peasants' study and application of Chairman Mao's works, promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and attempted to restore capitalism. Everyone expressed their determination to firmly follow the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin, study and apply Chairman Mao's works well, criticize and repudiate selfishness and revisionism, grasp revolution, promote production, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and achieve a double harvest in revolution and production. When the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai Brigade received the revolutionary books, some returned home to eat bitter meals, educating the younger generation to never forget class bitterness, always read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow Chairman Mao in revolution, and hold high the red flag of Dazhai that Chairman Mao personally planted, forever preserving its bright red color.
