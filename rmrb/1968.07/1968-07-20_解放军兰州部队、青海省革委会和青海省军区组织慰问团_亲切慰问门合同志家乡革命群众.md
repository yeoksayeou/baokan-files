A delegation composed of the People's Liberation Army Lanzhou Forces, the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee, and the Qinghai Military Region recently visited the hometown of Comrade Men He in Laishou County, Hebei Province, to warmly visit the family members and revolutionary people of Comrade Men He's hometown.

Led by Deputy Political Commissar Wu Shijie of the Qinghai Military Region, the delegation arrived in Comrade Men He's hometown in late June. They held grand visiting meetings in Laishou County and the village of Nan Shang Tun in Bei Shifu Commune, where the family of the hero resides. At the meetings, Deputy Leader Wang Zhongshan of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee and Deputy Leader Liu Hengcheng, a leader from the unit where Comrade Men He served, on behalf of the People's Liberation Army Lanzhou Forces, the Qinghai Military Region, and the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai, warmly visited the family members and revolutionary people of Comrade Men He's hometown. They expressed their determination to learn from Comrade Men He, to be absolutely loyal to the Party, to the people, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to fight for the defense of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in life, and to sacrifice for the defense of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in death. The delegation presented portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, works by Chairman Mao, and radiant Mao badges, as well as propaganda materials about the glorious deeds of Comrade Men He, to the family members and people of Comrade Men He's hometown. The propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought from the unit where Comrade Men He served also performed artistic programs praising Mao Zedong Thought and the heroic deeds of Comrade Men He.

During the visit, all members of the delegation, accompanied by representatives from the Beijing Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, leaders from the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee, and leaders from the Hebei Military Region, visited Comrade Men He's home multiple times. They carefully learned about the family members' study of Chairman Mao's works, participation in collective production labor, and living conditions. The family members of Comrade Men He were deeply moved by the Party and the people's visit. They held up the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted repeatedly, "Thank you, Chairman Mao! Thank you, Central Committee! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

During the visit to Comrade Men He's hometown, the delegation held various report meetings and artistic performances, propagating Mao Zedong Thought and the glorious deeds of Comrade Men He to more than 200,000 revolutionary people in Comrade Men He's hometown. The delegation members regarded this visit as a good opportunity to learn from Comrade Men He. In Comrade Men He's hometown, they visited the exhibition hall of Comrade Men He's heroic deeds, held discussions with Comrade Men He's relatives and the old Party members, old cadres, and poor and lower-middle peasants of Nan Shang Tun Brigade, held a bitter struggle meeting, and ate bitter struggle food with the heroic father Men Jincun and Men He's wife Zhang Fengying, who accompanied the delegation from Qinghai to Hebei. To learn from Comrade Men He's noble quality of always maintaining the simple and modest character of the working people, the delegation participated in collective production labor in the hero's hometown and held a criticism meeting with the villagers, angrily criticizing the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev in restoring capitalism in the countryside.

The delegation also reported on the glorious deeds of Comrade Men He and performed artistic programs praising the glorious deeds of Comrade Men He to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Shijiazhuang and Beijing.

Representatives from the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the Hebei Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Military Region also visited Comrade Men He's hometown to warmly visit the hero's family. Revolutionary masses and soldiers from all over the country sent thousands of enthusiastic letters to the family members of Comrade Men He, expressing their determination to learn from Comrade Men He, to be absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought higher, and to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.
