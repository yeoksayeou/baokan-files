"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article on the 9th, calling on the Thai people to unite closely under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party and resolutely take the revolutionary road of armed seizure of power.

The article pointed out: At present, the Thai nation and people are in the great era of national democratic revolution. The revolutionary goal is to sweep away the aggressive forces of American imperialism, overthrow the dictatorial and traitorous government of American imperialism's running dogs, smash the rule of the reactionary classes, and establish a truly independent and democratic new Thailand.

The article said: The great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong, taught us: "The central task and highest form of revolution is armed seizure of power, solving problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct." The Thai Communist Party combines the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times—Mao Zedong Thought—with the revolutionary practice of Thailand, leading the Thai people to walk the revolutionary road indicated by Chairman Mao Zedong, adhering to the truth that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," and resolutely carrying out armed struggle to the end, so as to seize power into the hands of the people.

The article said: The Thai Communist Party has summed up the experience of the Thai revolution, pointing out: Only by taking the road of armed seizure of power can the ultimate goal of the Thai people's revolution be achieved. Due to the correct leadership of the Thai Communist Party and the sincere and enthusiastic support of the Thai people, the flames of the Thai people's armed revolutionary struggle have been burning fiercely across the country, and the situation of the Thai revolution is better than ever.

The article pointed out: The U.S.-Thanom reactionary clique, unwilling to accept their failure, is stepping up their brutal suppression of the people's armed forces. At the same time, they are also stepping up their political fraud, attempting to use counter-revolutionary tactics to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Thai people and maintain their reactionary rule. However, the counter-revolutionary plots of the U.S.-Thai reactionaries will not succeed. The Thai Communist Party firmly declares: "Our party is determined to lead the people in armed struggle, mobilize the peasant masses, establish rural base areas, persist in people's war, encircle the cities from the countryside, and ultimately seize national power."

The article finally emphasized: As long as the Thai people unite more closely, under the correct leadership of the Thai Communist Party, and persist in the revolutionary road of armed seizure of power, then no matter how many difficulties there are on the revolutionary journey, no matter how tortuous the road is, the Thai people will definitely be able to overcome all obstacles and ultimately seize national power.

New China News Agency, July 10th: The people's armed forces led by the Thai Communist Party have recently frequently attacked the enemy in the northeast, north, and south, achieving new victories.

According to the broadcast of the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station, the brave people's armed forces in the northeast of Thailand, under the difficult conditions of the U.S.-Thai reactionaries' intensified "encirclement and suppression," have resolutely relied on the masses of the people, displayed the power of people's war, and fought many brilliant battles. In late June, the people's armed forces in Sakhon Nakhon Province ambushed an enemy "patrol," killing and wounding a group of enemies. The people's armed forces in Ubon Ratchathani, Kalasin, and Buriram Provinces have recently frequently attacked, punishing a group of notorious spies and special agents.

On June 11th, the people's armed forces in Chiang Rai Province in northern Thailand ambushed an enemy military vehicle, annihilating the five enemies on the vehicle. On June 14th, the U.S.-Thai reactionaries dispatched a batch of reactionary armed forces from the "7th Infantry Battalion" in Chiang Mai Province to Chiang Rai Province, Chiang Khan District, to "encircle and suppress" the people's armed forces. The people's armed forces in Chiang Rai Province bravely and wisely ambushed this batch of enemies. According to preliminary information, five enemies were killed and many were injured.

The people's armed forces in Surat Thani Province in the south recently also ambushed an enemy "patrol," killing and wounding four enemies. The people's armed forces in Nakhon Si Thammarat Province, on June 9th, in a rubber plantation in the area of Chaiya County, killed and wounded two enemies who came to suppress the people.

The people's armed forces in Surat Thani, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Phatthalung, and Yala Provinces are also actively engaged in propaganda and organizing the masses. They executed a group of local tyrants and enemy spies, receiving enthusiastic support from the people.

    “泰国人民之声”号召人民在泰共领导下紧密团结起来
    坚决走武装夺取政权的革命道路
    人民武装在东北部、北部和南部各地频繁出击，不断取得新战果
    新华社十日讯　“泰国人民之声”电台九日广播一篇文章，号召泰国人民在泰国共产党领导下，紧密团结起来，坚定不移地走武装夺取政权的革命道路。
    文章指出：当前，泰国民族和人民正处在民族民主革命的伟大时代。革命目标是扫除美帝国主义的侵略势力，推翻美帝国主义走狗的独裁卖国政府，摧毁反动阶级的统治，建立一个真正独立民主的人民新泰国。
    文章说：世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席教导我们：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”泰国共产党把当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想，同泰国的革命实践相结合，领导泰国人民走毛泽东主席指引的革命道路，坚持“枪杆子里面出政权”的真理，坚决把武装斗争进行到底，以便把政权夺到人民手中。
    文章说：泰国共产党总结了泰国革命斗争经验，指出：唯有走武装夺取政权的道路，才是实现泰国人民革命最终目标的唯一正确的道路。由于得到泰国共产党的正确领导和泰国人民的真心实意的大力支持，泰国人民革命武装斗争的烈火已在全国各地熊熊燃烧，泰国革命形势空前大好。
    文章指出：美国—他侬反动集团不甘心于它们的失败，正在加紧疯狂镇压人民武装。同时，它们又在加紧玩弄政治大骗局，妄图采用反革命两手来扑灭泰国人民的革命烈火，维护它们的反动统治。但是，美泰反动派的反革命阴谋是不能得逞的。泰国共产党坚定地表示：“我们党下定决心领导人民进行武装斗争，发动农民群众，建立农村根据地，坚持人民战争，以农村包围城市，最后夺取全国政权。”
    文章最后强调指出：只要泰国人民更加紧密地团结起来，在泰国共产党的正确领导下，坚持武装夺取政权的革命道路，那末，不管在革命征途上，还会有多少困难，不管道路多么曲折，泰国人民必定能够扫除一切障碍，最后夺取全国政权。
    新华社十日讯　泰国共产党领导的人民武装，最近在东北部、北部和南部各地频繁打击敌人，不断取得新的战果。
    据“泰国人民之声”电台广播，英勇的泰国东北部人民武装，发扬敢于斗争，敢于胜利的大无畏革命精神，在美泰反动派加紧疯狂“围剿”的困难条件下，坚决依靠人民群众，发挥人民战争的威力，打了不少漂亮仗。沙功那空府人民武装在六月底伏击敌人的“巡逻队”，打死打伤一批敌人。乌汶、加拉信和武里南等府的人民武装，最近频繁出击，惩处了一批罪大恶极的暗探特务。
    泰国北部清莱府人民武装在六月十一日，曾伏击一辆敌人军车，全歼车上的五名敌人。六月十四日，美泰反动派从清迈府调遣了“第七步兵营”的一批反动武装，前往清莱府清堪县“围剿”人民武装。清莱府人民武装勇敢机智地伏击了这批敌人。据初步消息，有五名敌人被打死，多名受伤。
    南部素叻府人民武装，最近也伏击了一支敌人“巡逻队”，打死打伤敌人四名。洛坤府人民武装，六月九日在差越县境的一个橡胶园里，打死打伤二名前往镇压人民的敌人。
    素叻、洛坤、博他仑、亚拉等府人民武装还积极进行宣传和组织群众的工作。他们处决了一批地方恶霸和敌人的暗探特务，受到人民群众的热烈欢迎。
