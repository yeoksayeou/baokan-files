The People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed on a certain island in the Yellow Sea has actively assisted the fishermen in setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes on the rolling waves of the sea. Each fishing boat hoists the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, transforming the vast fishing grounds into a battlefield for revolutionary criticism. This has significantly heightened the fishermen's awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, powerfully promoting both revolution and production.

The fishermen on this island spend ten months of the year in the distant sea engaged in intense fishing operations, braving the wind and waves, with a high degree of mobility and dispersed personnel. In the past, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents demanded that fishing boats focus solely on production when at sea, opposing and obstructing the broad masses of fishermen from studying Chairman Mao's works. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, every boat set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works daily, and fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev. When the fishing boats returned to port to unload the catch, the fishermen gathered for large-scale criticism meetings; when the boats were fishing in the distant sea, the fishermen utilized the gaps between casting and retrieving the nets to hold small-scale criticism meetings on the boats. Sometimes, while a criticism meeting was in progress on the boat, a storm would hit, but everyone remained steadfast, insisting on finishing the meeting. The fishermen also took up their pens to write criticism articles, setting up "Revolutionary Criticism Columns" at the bow or stern of the boats, and some even pasted criticism articles on the mast. The fishermen said, "The waves can only soak our fishing boats and drench our clothes, but they cannot shake our resolve to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev."

During the process of conducting revolutionary criticism, each fishing boat carried out class education through recalling bitterness and sweetness. In the dark old society, the broad masses of fishermen suffered deeply from the brutal oppression of imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the local fishing tyrants. During the period when the Japanese invaders occupied the island, they arbitrarily killed fishermen and plundered their property. The fishing tyrants, relying on the power of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, committed evil deeds on the island and brutally exploited the fishermen. Old fisherman Liu Deshan, generation after generation, suffered from the oppression of the fishing tyrants. His grandfather died tragically at sea while fishing for the tyrants, his father, unable to repay debts, was driven to death by the tyrants, and subsequently, his mother starved to death, and his younger brother froze to death, leaving him as a helpless orphan. Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the broad masses of fishermen on the island stood up and became masters, embarking on the broad road of socialism. However, the Chinese Khrushchev, pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, attempted to restore capitalism, making the broad masses of fishermen suffer twice and return to the dark days of oppression and exploitation. Through recalling bitterness and sweetness, the broad masses of fishermen ignited their deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev and all class enemies, deepening their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. With profound proletarian feelings, they said, "Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in our hearts, Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for our revolution. No matter how strong the wind or how high the waves, we fishermen will always prioritize studying and applying Chairman Mao's works."

This year, revolutionary criticism on each fishing boat has surged higher and higher. In the spring, when the fishing boats first set sail, the fishermen studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on class and class struggle, exposing the evil activities of class enemies on the island who sabotaged fishing production, fiercely criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "class struggle extinguished," significantly enhancing class struggle awareness, and ensuring the successful spring fishing production. During the fishing process, the broad masses of fishermen studied Chairman Mao's great teachings of "wholeheartedly serving the people," fiercely criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies of "public and private fusion" and "public and private integration," further establishing the thought of fishing for the revolution. To adhere to the socialist path, the broad masses of fishermen repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings of "only socialism can save China," systematically criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, such as "three autonomies and one contract," "four freedoms," and "contracting to the boat." The People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team displayed the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev's attempt to restore capitalism in the form of illustrations on the fishing boats. Through revolutionary criticism and viewing the exhibition, the broad masses of fishermen significantly heightened their awareness of the struggle between the two lines. They said, "No matter how bad it is, the worst is the Chinese Khrushchev leading us back to the old path! No matter how poisonous it is, the most poisonous is the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev! We must throw the Chinese Khrushchev into the sea, making him never able to rise again!"

Through studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and conducting revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of fishermen have unleashed an unprecedented enthusiasm for revolution and production. This year, the early spring weather was cold, the water temperature was low, and the fish migration patterns were erratic, adding many difficulties to the spring fishing production. The fishermen highly carried forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, pooling their wisdom and strength, overcoming various difficulties, tracking fish schools, and analyzing the fish migration patterns. Consequently, they quickly seized the central fishing grounds. During the fishing process, the fishermen raced against time, working day and night, achieving an unprecedented fishing harvest.

    把辽阔渔场变成革命大批判战场
    解放军驻黄海某岛毛泽东思想宣传队帮助渔民大办毛泽东思想学习班，深入开展革命大批判，大大提高了渔民的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，换来了渔业大丰收
    据新华社沈阳电　人民解放军驻黄海某岛毛泽东思想宣传队，积极帮助渔民在浪涛滚滚的大海上大办毛泽东思想学习班，条条渔船高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把辽阔渔场变成革命大批判的战场，大大提高了广大渔民的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，有力地促进了革命和生产。
    这个岛上的渔民，一年有十个月在远海从事紧张的捕捞生产，风里来，浪里去，流动性大，人员不集中。过去，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人要求渔船出海只抓生产，反对和阻挠广大渔民学习毛主席著作。无产阶级文化大革命中，广大渔民在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，船船办起了毛泽东思想学习班，天天活学活用毛主席著作，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线。渔船回港卸鱼时，渔民集中起来开大型批判会；渔船在远海捕鱼时，渔民就利用投网起网的空隙，在船上开小型批判会。有时正在船上开批判会，狂风巨浪袭来，但大家岿然不动，坚持开完批判会。渔民们还拿起笔来写批判文章，在船头或船尾设置“革命大批判专栏”，有的把批判文章贴到桅杆上。渔民们说：“巨浪只能打湿咱们的渔船，浇透咱们的衣服，但不能动摇咱们活学活用毛主席著作，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的决心。”
    在开展革命大批判的过程中，条条渔船进行了忆苦思甜的阶级教育。在黑暗的旧社会，广大渔民深受帝国主义、国民党反动派和岛上渔霸的残酷压迫。日本侵略者侵占海岛时期，在岛上任意杀害渔民，大肆劫掠渔民财物。渔霸依靠帝国主义和国民党反动派的势力，在岛上为非作歹，残酷剥削渔民。老渔民刘德善，祖祖辈辈受尽渔霸的欺压，爷爷给渔霸打鱼惨死在大海里，爸爸无钱还债，被渔霸占去仅有的二亩地活活气死，随后母亲饿死，弟弟冻死，他就成了无依无靠的孤儿。在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，岛上广大渔民翻身作了主人，走上了社会主义的康庄大道。可是中国赫鲁晓夫推行反革命修正主义路线，妄图复辟资本主义，使广大渔民受二遍苦，回到受压迫受剥削的黑暗年代。通过忆苦思甜，广大渔民激发了对中国赫鲁晓夫和一切阶级敌人的深仇大恨，加深了对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。他们怀着深厚的无产阶级感情说：“毛主席是咱们心中最红的红太阳，毛泽东思想是咱们干革命的指路明灯，风再大，浪再高，咱们渔民也要把活学活用毛主席著作放在第一位。”
    今年以来，条条渔船革命大批判一浪高过一浪地向前发展。春天，渔船刚出海时，渔民学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的伟大教导，大揭岛上阶级敌人破坏渔业生产的罪恶活动，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，大大提高了阶级斗争观念，保证了春汛渔业生产的胜利进行。在捕鱼过程中，广大渔民学习了毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务”的伟大教导，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“大公有私”、“公私溶化”等谬论，进一步树立了为革命打鱼的思想。为了坚持走社会主义道路，广大渔民反复学习了毛主席“只有社会主义能够救中国”的伟大教导，系统地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人鼓吹的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“包产到船”等反革命修正主义黑货。解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，把中国赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义的罪行，绘成图画在渔船上展览。广大渔民通过革命大批判和看了展览，大大提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟。他们说：“千坏万坏，中国赫鲁晓夫叫咱们走回头路最坏！千毒万毒，中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线最毒！咱们要把中国赫鲁晓夫打入海底，叫他永世不得翻身！”
    广大渔民通过活学活用毛泽东思想，进行革命大批判，焕发出抓革命、促生产的冲天干劲。今年早春天气冷，水温低，鱼群回游规律多变，给春汛生产增加了不少困难。渔民们高度发扬了敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，群策群力，克服各种困难，侦察鱼群，研究分析鱼群回游规律，因而很快就抓住了中心渔场。在捕鱼过程中，渔民们争分夺秒，日夜奋战，换来了空前未有的渔业大丰收。
