Workers at a metallurgical plant in Santiago have been on strike for over a month, occupying the factory and building defenses to resist police suppression.

	New workers' struggles in Chile

		Workers at the American-controlled Cerrillos Copper Company in Santiago began a strike on July 22, demanding wage increases. As of July 26, the strike continues. Workers have set up picket lines in front of the factory, chanting slogans such as: "Yankees, get out of Chile!" "We will not allow the Yankees to continue plundering our country's wealth!" "Workers will drive the Yankees out of Chile!"

		Over 2,000 administrative staff at the University of Chile went on strike on July 25, demanding the payment of overdue wages. They have vowed to continue their strike until their demands are met.

		Workers at the Wagner-Stan electronic factory, which produces German-brand radios and televisions, have been on strike for nearly 50 days. They recently occupied the factory and built defenses within it to protest the owner's refusal to increase wages.

		Over 200 workers at the Wolf Metallurgical Plant in the capital, Santiago, have been on strike for over a month. They have also occupied the factory and built defenses, repelling police attempts to suppress the strike several times.

		Additionally, approximately 500 textile and ceramic industry workers, as well as 400 educators in the countryside, have also gone on strike.
