In the face of strong condemnation and resistance from progressive workers and students, the farce of the French "National Assembly Election" ended in disgrace. The French Communist Party (PCF) shamelessly collaborated with bourgeois parties, attempting to gain a share of the leftovers from the "election."

According to a report from our correspondent at Xinhua News Agency on July 3rd: The French ruling class, amidst the unprecedented surge of the French people's movement, recently staged a farce of the "National Assembly Election." The French monopoly capitalists attempted to use this "election" as a means to extinguish the people's struggle and coordinate internal conflicts within the ruling class, aiming to stabilize the bourgeois reactionary rule. However, for the French ruling class, which has been heavily struck by workers and students, this "election" trick not only failed to save them but also exposed their reactionary nature, further fueling the people's broader and more intense struggle.

This "election" was announced by French President Charles de Gaulle at the end of May when the workers and students were at the peak of their struggle. The struggle of workers and students severely struck the reactionary rule of the French monopoly capitalists, causing them to panic and lose sleep. It was under these circumstances that de Gaulle, after tense discussions within the ruling class, hastily announced the dissolution of the National Assembly, which was elected just last year, and called for a new "election." They attempted, with the collaboration of the traitorous PCF group, to use the "election" as a bourgeois democratic facade to undermine the morale of workers and students, leading the struggle astray.

The French monopoly capitalists played this "election" trick also to facilitate political bargaining among various factions within their ranks, coordinate relationships, and unite to jointly deal with French workers and students.

The malicious intent behind the French monopoly capitalists' staging of this election was also to use the pretext of maintaining "peace" during the election period to suppress the struggles of French workers and students.

The "election" conspiracy thrown out by the French monopoly capitalists was immediately met with condemnation and resistance from progressive workers and students in France. They not only continued their struggle but also, in many demonstrations, burned a large number of bourgeois politicians' election advertisements, destroyed election service offices, and burned ballot boxes to express their angry protest against this political fraud. On June 30th, Paris students, despite the government's ban and police suppression, held a demonstration against the "election." Many progressive workers and students took a stance of boycotting this "election."

In stark contrast, the PCF group worked extra hard for this "election" farce, running around, cheering, and acting as loyal dogs of the French ruling class. They were determined to gain more leftovers from the French ruling class through this "election." During the campaign, they once again openly collaborated with bourgeois parties, forming so-called "vote alliances." They viciously attacked the revolutionary struggles of workers and students, labeling them as "blind riots" and "irresponsible adventures," among other things. In his June 28th campaign speech, Roger even shamelessly declared that the PCF had "no common ground with the revolutionary actions of workers and students" and had "condemned the use of such methods from the beginning." They also posted slogans everywhere, declaring that they had "never broken a window," "never burned a car," and "never destroyed a factory or an office," completely exposing the treacherous face of the PCF in betraying the French people.

Now, the bourgeois election farce in France has basically ended. According to the results published on July 1st, out of 485 seats, the Gaullists and the Independent Republicans, who formed a government alliance with de Gaulle, occupied 358 seats. The seats of the PCF group and other bourgeois parties in the parliament were significantly reduced. The change in seats in the bourgeois parliament is merely a readjustment of the forces of various bourgeois factions in the parliament, which cannot alleviate the increasingly intense class contradictions in France and is of no help to the French ruling class in escaping the numerous political and economic difficulties it faces. French Prime Minister Georges Pompidou, who belongs to the Gaullist faction, admitted on June 30th after the "election": "The future is undoubtedly difficult, and the problems have not been solved."

    在进步工人、学生强烈谴责和抵制下
    法国“国民议会选举”丑剧黯然收场
    法修无耻同资产阶级政党同流合污企图从“选举”中分得残羹剩饭
    据新华社三日讯　本社记者报道：法国统治集团在法国人民运动空前高涨的形势下，最近上演了一出“国民议会选举”的丑剧。法国垄断资产阶级妄图把这次“选举”作为扑灭法国人民斗争和协调统治集团内部矛盾的手段，用以稳定资产阶级的反动统治。但是，对于遭到工人、学生沉重打击的法国统治集团来说，这种“选举”花招，非但成不了它们的救命稻草，反而会使人民更加看清它们的反动本质，从而促使人民的更广泛更猛烈的斗争。
    这次“选举”是在五月底法国工人、学生掀起斗争高潮时，由法国总统戴高乐宣布进行的。工人和学生的斗争猛烈地打击了法国垄断资产阶级的反动统治，使他们惊慌失措，坐卧不安。就是在这种情况下，戴高乐在统治集团内部紧张商讨后，匆忙宣布解散刚在去年选出的国民议会，重新举行“选举”。企图在法修集团这伙叛徒工贼的配合下，利用“选举”这块资产阶级假民主的招牌，瓦解工人和学生的斗志，把斗争引到邪路上去。
    法国垄断资产阶级玩弄这次“选举”花招，也是为了便于他们内部各派势力之间进行政治买卖，协调关系，勾结起来共同对付法国的工人和学生。
    法国垄断资产阶级导演这场选举的险恶用心，还在于借口保持选举期间的“平静”，来大肆镇压法国工人和学生的斗争。
    法国垄断资产阶级抛出来的这一“选举”阴谋，一开始就遭到了法国进步工人和学生的谴责和抵制。他们不仅继续坚持斗争，而且在许多示威游行中，烧毁了大量资产阶级政客竞选用的广告牌，捣毁了为竞选服务的办事处，烧掉了投票箱，以表示他们对这种政治骗局的愤怒抗议。六月三十日，巴黎学生还不顾政府的禁令和警察的镇压，举行了反对“选举”的示威。许多进步工人和学生在这次“选举”中采取了抵制态度。
    与此成鲜明对照的是，法修集团分外卖力地为这出“选举”丑剧东奔西走，摇旗呐喊，充当了法国统治集团的忠实走狗。他们一心一意想通过这次“选举”从法国统治集团那里分得更多的残羹剩饭。在竞选过程中，他们再一次公然同资产阶级政党同流合污，大搞所谓选票“联盟”。对于工人和学生的革命斗争则恶毒攻击、诬之为“盲目暴动”，“不负责任的冒险”等等。罗歇在六月二十八日的竞选演说中，更是无耻地自我表白法修同工人和学生的革命行动“毫无共同之处”，并且“一开始就谴责使用这种方法”。他们还到处张贴标语，表白自己“没有打破过一扇玻璃窗”，“没有烧过一辆汽车”，“没有破坏过一所工厂和一个办公室”等等，这完全暴露了法修集团背叛法国人民的丑恶嘴脸。
    现在，法国资产阶级的竞选丑剧已经基本结束。据一日公布的结果，在四百八十五个议席中，戴高乐派和同戴高乐组成政府联盟的独立共和党人占了三百五十八席，法修集团和其他资产阶级政党在议会中的席位则大大减少。资产阶级议会中席位的这种变动，只是法国资产阶级各派在议会中势力的重新调整，它绝不能缓和法国日趋激烈的阶级矛盾，也丝毫无助于法国统治集团摆脱面临的重重政治、经济困难。属于戴高乐派的法国总理蓬皮杜六月三十日在“选举”后承认：“未来无疑是困难的，问题还没有解决。”
