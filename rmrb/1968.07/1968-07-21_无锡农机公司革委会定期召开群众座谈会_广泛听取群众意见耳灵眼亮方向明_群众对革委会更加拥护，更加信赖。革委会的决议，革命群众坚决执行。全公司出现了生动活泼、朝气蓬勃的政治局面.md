The Revolutionary Committee of Wuxi Agricultural Machinery Company in Jiangsu Province regularly holds mass consultation meetings, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "reform state organs, the most fundamental thing is to connect with the masses." Through these meetings, the committee frequently and broadly solicits the opinions of the masses, humbly listens to their criticisms, and strengthens its connection with the people, promoting the thought revolutionization of its members.

Members of the Revolutionary Committee often go deep into the grassroots, engage with the masses, actively participate in labor, conduct investigations, and engage in heart-to-heart talks with the people, maintaining close ties with them. At the same time, within the committee, they frequently engage in criticism and self-criticism to promote the thought revolutionization of its members.

In March, during a meeting of the business group of the Revolutionary Committee, which included participation from the masses, the masses criticized that the struggle-criticism meetings led by the committee were too cold, with more speeches from cadres and fewer from the masses. This criticism caught the attention of the committee. They immediately held another mass consultation meeting, sincerely seeking the masses' opinions on the struggle-criticism work. Based on the masses' feedback, the committee mobilized the masses more actively in the struggle-criticism work and provided them with materials and party policies before each meeting. As a result, the masses spoke more enthusiastically during the meetings, making them lively and vibrant. This living example educated the committee members greatly. From then on, they held one to two mass consultation meetings every week, making it a regular practice to maintain close ties with the masses, improve work, and promote their own thought revolutionization. The number of participants in each meeting varied from seven to eight, representing different workshops and departments. Committee members took turns participating in these meetings. During the discussions, everyone spoke freely and openly. The committee collected the opinions raised in the meetings, verified them when necessary, formed their own opinions, and then communicated them to the masses for implementation.

Through practice, they found that using mass consultation meetings to broadly solicit the masses' opinions had three advantages: first, the opinions raised by the masses in the meetings were more representative; second, the masses could discuss and supplement each other's opinions, making them more concentrated and accurate; third, the meetings reflected opinions more comprehensively and timely, helping the committee to quickly solve problems and improve work.

The Revolutionary Committee of the Agricultural Machinery Company fully utilized the advantages of mass consultation meetings, making it an important measure to improve the committee's work. The committee, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "be good at turning the party's policies into the actions of the masses, and be good at making every movement and struggle not only understood by the leading cadres but also by the broad masses, so that they can grasp and implement them," held mass consultation meetings before implementing any work, launching any mass activities, or holding any struggle-criticism meetings. During these meetings, committee members discussed issues with the masses, exchanged opinions, formulated measures, and implemented plans. Through these meetings, the committee gained a clearer understanding of the masses' emotions, demands, and activities, making their work more targeted; the masses also had a clear understanding of every task and activity assigned by the committee, acting with greater determination and enthusiasm, and maintaining unity. Because the committee humbly listened to the masses' opinions and worked to improve their work, the masses became more supportive and trusting of the committee. The committee's resolutions were firmly executed by the revolutionary masses, creating a lively and vibrant political atmosphere throughout the company.

Members of the Revolutionary Committee also used mass consultation meetings as an important way to accept the masses' criticisms and supervision, continuously removing political dust from themselves, and promoting thought revolutionization. The committee correctly handled the criticisms and praise from the masses in the meetings. They took the masses' praise as a driving force, remaining humble and cautious, and working to transform their worldview. For the masses' correct criticisms, they analyzed the causes, dug out the roots, and quickly corrected their shortcomings with a "seize the day" spirit. They also used the criticisms raised by the masses in the meetings as important content for the committee's self-criticism and criticism of revisionism activities.

Members of the Revolutionary Committee believed that the process of regularly holding mass consultation meetings was also a process of continuously learning from the masses and summarizing experiences. They said: By frequently going deep into the grassroots, engaging with the masses, participating in labor, and regularly holding mass consultation meetings to broadly listen to the masses' opinions, we can have keen ears, bright eyes, and a clear direction. The revolutionary masses also enthusiastically supported the committee's efforts to strengthen ties with the people. They said, "The committee values the masses' opinions, making us feel even more connected with the committee."

    无锡农机公司革委会定期召开群众座谈会
    广泛听取群众意见耳灵眼亮方向明
    群众对革委会更加拥护，更加信赖。革委会的决议，革命群众坚决执行。全公司出现了生动活泼、朝气蓬勃的政治局面
    新华社南京二十日电　江苏无锡市农机公司革命委员会，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，建立了定期召开群众座谈会的制度。革委会通过群众座谈会，经常地广泛地征求群众意见，虚心听取群众批评，更加强了革委会同群众的密切联系，促进了革委会成员的思想革命化。
    无锡市农机公司革委会成员经常深入基层，深入群众，积极参加劳动，进行调查研究，和群众广泛开展谈心活动，密切同群众的联系。同时，在革委会内部经常开展批评和自我批评，促进革委会成员的思想革命化。
    今年三月份，在革委会业务组召开的一次有群众参加的座谈会上，群众提出批评说，革委会领导的斗批会显得太冷清，干部发言多，群众发言少。这一批评，引起了革委会的重视。他们立即又召开群众座谈会，诚恳地征求群众对斗批工作的意见。根据群众的意见，革委会在斗批工作中放手发动群众，并且在每次斗批会之前，把革委会所掌握的材料和党的方针政策交给群众。这样做的结果，群众在斗批会上发言踊跃，斗批会开得热气腾腾。这一活生生的事例，使革委会成员受到很大教育。从此，他们每星期都要召开一次到两次群众座谈会，把召开群众座谈会作为经常密切联系群众，改进工作，促进自己思想革命化的一项重要制度固定了下来。参加座谈会的人，每次七八个不等，各车间、各部门都有，每个人尽可能具有一定的代表性。革委会的成员轮流参加群众座谈会。座谈时不拘形式，大家推心置腹，畅所欲言。革委会把座谈会上提出的意见集中起来，必要时再拿到群众中去调查、核实，形成革委会的意见，然后交给群众，在群众中贯彻下去。
    通过实践，他们体会到，运用群众座谈会这一形式广泛征求群众意见，有三个好处：一，群众在座谈会上提出的意见，具有较大的代表性；二，群众在座谈会上可以展开讨论，互相启发，互相补充，使意见更集中，更正确；三，座谈会反映意见比较全面、及时，有利于革委会迅速地解决问题，改进工作。
    农机公司革委会充分发挥群众座谈会的优越性，把召开群众座谈会作为改进革委会工作的一个重要措施。革委会遵照伟大领袖毛主席“善于把党的政策变为群众的行动，善于使我们的每一个运动，每一个斗争，不但领导干部懂得，而且广大的群众都能懂得，都能掌握，这是一项马克思列宁主义的领导艺术”的教导，在每落实一项工作、开展一次群众活动、举行一次斗批会的时候，革委会总要预先召开群众座谈会，在座谈会上，革委会成员跟群众一起讨论问题，交换意见，制定措施，落实方案。通过座谈会，革委会对群众的情绪、要求、活动，有了更清楚的了解，工作更有的放矢；群众对革委会布置的每项工作、每项活动，也都心中有数，行动时决心大，干劲足，步调一致。由于革委会通过座谈会和其他方式，虚心听取群众意见，努力改进自己的工作，因而群众对革委会更加拥护，更加信赖，革委会确定的决议，革命群众坚决执行，全公司出现了生动活泼、朝气蓬勃的政治局面。
    农机公司革委会成员还把召开群众座谈会作为接受群众的批评和监督，不断扫除自己身上的政治灰尘，促进思想革命化的重要途径。革委会正确对待群众在座谈会上提出的批评和表扬。他们把群众的表扬作为前进的动力，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，努力改造自己的世界观。对于群众的正确批评，他们以
  “只争朝夕”的精神，分析原因，挖掘根源，尽快地改正自己的缺点。他们还随时把群众在座谈会上提出的批评意见，作为革委会开展斗私批修活动的重要内容。
    农机公司革委会成员认为，不断地召开群众座谈会的过程，也是不断地向群众学习、不断地总结经验的过程。他们说：经常深入基层，深入群众，参加劳动，同时又经常召开群众座谈会，更广泛地听取群众的意见，我们就耳灵、眼亮、方向明。广大革命群众也热情支持革委会多方设法加强同群众的联系。他们说，革委会这样重视群众的意见，使我们跟革委会更加心连心。
