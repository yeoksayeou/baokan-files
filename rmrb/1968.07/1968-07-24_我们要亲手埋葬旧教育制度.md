At a time when the entire nation, with a billion revolutionary people, is following the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, full of revolutionary enthusiasm and determination, striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao has issued another extremely important new directive on educational revolution: "Universities should still be run. Here I am mainly talking about universities of science and engineering, but the system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should be in command. Follow the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among workers. Select students from workers and peasants with practical experience, let them study in schools for a few years, and then return to production practice."

Chairman Mao's great call is the most sharp weapon for us to thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational line and the bourgeois educational system. It is the battle program for us to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end. It is the fundamental guarantee for cultivating millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and preventing the restoration of capitalism. It is a long-term strategy for opposing revisionism and preventing restoration.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our educational policy should enable those who receive education to develop morally, intellectually, and physically, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." However, for a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev, in order to achieve his evil goal of usurping the Party, usurping state power, and restoring capitalism, used the educational front as a battlefield. He stubbornly promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. He strongly opposed the idea that education must emphasize proletarian politics, opposed the integration of theory with practice, and opposed intellectuals participating in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. He openly advocated that students should "concentrate on studying, not hearing what is outside the window, and focus on reading the classics," spreading all sorts of fallacies. He also advocated the "small pagoda" system of promotion, seriously poisoning the healthy minds and bodies of the younger generation. As a result, many students regarded studying and advancing as a means of seeking fame and fortune, pursuing "academic titles" and "degrees," turning students into "spiritual aristocrats" who are detached from proletarian politics, detached from the masses of workers and peasants, and detached from production practice.

In 1962, our unit recruited a batch of graduates from colleges and universities. Due to the poisoning of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist educational line, they had long been detached from workers and peasants and from reality. When they arrived at the unit, they found everything awkward, and some even thought that university graduates serving in the army was a "waste of talent." However, they are the youth of the Mao Zedong era, with boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao. They were willing to break free from the spiritual shackles of the bourgeois educational system. Through studying Chairman Mao's works, they worked hard on transforming their worldview and made rapid political progress. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "learning war from war—this is our main method," put down their intellectual airs, and willingly became ordinary soldiers. They lived, studied, labored, and fought together with us soldiers, constantly drawing nourishment from the soldiers, and were warmly welcomed by the officers and soldiers of our unit. Once, our unit was sent to a certain place to carry out a mission. Due to heavy snow and ice, the railway was blocked, and the train was forced to stop. At this critical moment, our supplies were almost exhausted, and cold and hunger threatened us. At this juncture, they firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching that intellectuals should learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers. Together with everyone, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," loudly reciting "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Finally, they overcame hunger and cold and successfully completed the glorious mission assigned by the Party. Now, most of these young intellectuals have joined the Party, and some have become active promoters of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They have a common experience: the People's Liberation Army is a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, a revolutionary crucible for tempering and transforming people. Young intellectuals of student origin can only follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao, integrate with workers and peasants, to achieve ideological transformation and temper themselves into successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The publication of Chairman Mao's latest directive is like a lighthouse shining brightly, illuminating the path of the proletarian educational revolution, and sounding the new battle call for educational revolution. We warmly welcome Chairman Mao's latest directive. We warmly welcome young intellectuals to go to the workers and peasants, to the army, and resolutely take the path of integrating with workers and peasants. Following the course charted by Chairman Mao, we will advance to victory!

    我们要亲手埋葬旧教育制度
    解放军某部　田存之
    正当全国亿万军民满怀革命的壮志豪情，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要时刻，我们伟大领袖毛主席关于教育革命的又一极为重要的最新指示发表了：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”毛主席的伟大号召，是我们彻底批判修正主义教育路线，批判资产阶级教育制度的最锐利的武器，是我们将无产阶级教育革命进行到底的战斗纲领，是培养千百万无产阶级革命事业接班人，巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟的根本保证，是反修防修的百年大计。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”可是，长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫为了实现他篡党、篡政、复辟资本主义的罪恶目的，利用教育战线这块阵地，顽固地推行反革命修正主义教育路线。他竭力反对教育必须突出无产阶级政治，反对理论联系实际，反对知识分子参加阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动。他公然主张学生“要安心读书，两耳不闻窗外事，一心专读圣贤书”，散布种种谬论，并提倡“小宝塔”式的升学制度，严重地毒害了青年一代身心的健康，使得不少学生把读书升学当作索取名利的“升官图”，一味追求什么“学衔”、“学位”，使学生变成了脱离无产阶级政治、脱离工农群众、脱离生产实践的“三脱离”的“精神贵族”。
    在一九六二年，我们部队补入了一批大专院校的毕业生。他们由于受中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的毒害，长期脱离工农，脱离实际，一到部队，什么都感到别扭，有的甚至认为大学毕业生当兵是“屈才”。但是，他们是毛泽东时代的青年，对毛主席无限热爱，无限忠诚，愿意摆脱资产阶级教育制度套在自己脖子上的精神枷锁。通过学习毛主席著作，在改造世界观上狠下功夫，政治上成长进步很快。他们遵照毛主席的“从战争学习战争——这是我们的主要方法”的教导，放下了知识分子的架子，甘当普通一兵，处处同我们战士生活在一起，学习在一起，劳动在一起，战斗在一起，不断的从战士身上吸取营养，深受我们部队指战员的欢迎。有一次，我们部队到某地执行任务，由于风雪过大，铁路堵塞，火车被迫停了下来。这时，我们带的干粮快用完了，寒冷和饥饿威胁着我们。在这节骨眼上，他们牢牢记住毛主席的知识分子要向工农兵学习的教导，同大家一道反复学习毛主席的《为人民服务》《愚公移山》等光辉著作，高声朗读“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”最后终于战胜了饥饿和严寒，出色地完成了党交给的光荣任务。现在，这些知识青年，大部分都入了党，有的已成为活学活用毛泽东思想的积极分子。他们有一个共同的体会是：人民解放军是一所毛泽东思想的大学校，是锻炼人、改造人的革命大熔炉。学生出身的知识青年，只有走毛主席指引的道路，同工农兵相结合，才是实现思想革命化，把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业接班人的唯一正确的道路。
    毛主席这一最新指示的发表，象光芒四射的灯塔一样照亮了无产阶级教育革命的道路，吹响了教育革命的新的战斗号角。我们最热烈地欢呼毛主席这一最新指示的发表，我们最热烈地欢迎知识青年到工农中去，到部队中去，坚决走同工农兵相结合的道路，沿着毛主席所指引的航向胜利前进！
