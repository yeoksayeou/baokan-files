Lao People's Liberation Armed Forces Achieve New Victories in June
Patriotic Military and Civilians in Phongsali and Other Provinces Bravely Fight and Inflict Heavy Losses on the Enemy

KANGAY, July 6 (Xinhua) — Following their great victories in the dry season of last winter and this spring, the Lao People's Liberation Armed Forces have continued to take the initiative in attacking the enemy and bravely counterattacking the enemy's "sweeping" operations since the rainy season began in June, achieving many new victories.

According to broadcasts by the Pathet Lao radio station, on June 20, the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, in order to carry out their evil plot to destroy the liberated areas, sent a batch of bandits to the liberated areas of Ban Wa and Ban Dong in the province of Louang Namtha. The local patriotic armed forces immediately launched a fierce counterattack. After a fierce battle, they completely repelled the bandits' invasion.

On June 15, the patriotic armed forces in Savannakhet Province shelled an enemy stronghold, killing several enemy soldiers and destroying two enemy buildings.

Earlier, the local forces and guerrilla units in Savannakhet Province, in addition to cooperating with the main forces in combat, also took the initiative to attack the enemy. In May alone, the local forces killed 24 enemy soldiers and seized a large number of weapons and ammunition.

On June 15, the patriotic armed forces in Udomxay Province annihilated a group of U.S.-sponsored bandits, killing and wounding a number of enemy soldiers, including a company-level officer.

On June 15 and 18, the patriotic armed forces in Saravane Province shelled the enemy stronghold at Nong Bua, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Since this enemy stronghold was surrounded by the Lao People's Liberation Armed Forces in April, more than 100 enemy soldiers have been annihilated.

KANGAY, July 5 (Xinhua) — According to a report by the Pathet Lao News Agency, the patriotic military and civilians in the districts of Ongtheu and Ongphou in Phongsali Province fought bravely in more than a month of battles from April 26 to June 10, annihilating and dissolving 106 enemy soldiers, seizing 121 pieces of various weapons and a batch of military supplies.

According to another report, the patriotic military and civilians in Louang Namtha Province attacked the enemy stationed 23 kilometers south of Namtha City on June 3, annihilating 9 enemy soldiers, seizing one recoilless gun, and liberating three villages. Earlier, the patriotic military and civilians in Xieng Khouang Province annihilated 25 enemy soldiers in the anti-"sweeping" battle at the end of May.

The patriotic military and civilians in Luang Prabang Province have annihilated a batch of enemy soldiers in recent battles.

According to a Xinhua report from Kangay, the patriotic armed forces in Savannakhet and Saravane Provinces launched fierce attacks on the enemy illegally stationed in the Mang Phalan, Vap, and Xepone areas from May 16 to June 6 over a period of 22 days, annihilating more than 350 enemy soldiers.

On June 6, a unit of the patriotic armed forces in Savannakhet Province broke through the enemy's heavy defenses and attacked the Mang Phalan stronghold, killing 39 enemy soldiers. The remaining enemy soldiers fled in panic. The patriotic armed forces and guerrilla units, taking advantage of the victory, pursued and killed or wounded about 90 more enemy soldiers, finally liberating the county town.

While attacking Mang Phalan, the patriotic armed forces in Saravane Province intensified their siege of the enemy strongholds in the Vap and Xepone areas. By June 6, they had killed or wounded 221 enemy soldiers and seized 25 pieces of various weapons.

The patriotic military and civilians of Laos, displaying the immense power of people's war, have continuously taken the initiative to launch widespread attacks, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy's combat forces and dealing a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists and the right-wing military of Laos.
