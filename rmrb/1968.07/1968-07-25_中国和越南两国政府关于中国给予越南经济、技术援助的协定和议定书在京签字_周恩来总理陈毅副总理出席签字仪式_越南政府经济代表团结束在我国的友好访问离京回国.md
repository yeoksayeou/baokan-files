The agreement and protocol between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on China's economic and technological aid to Vietnam were signed in Beijing on July 23.

Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi attended the signing ceremony.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian of the State Council and Vice Premier Le Quyen of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam signed the agreement on behalf of their respective governments.

Attending the signing ceremony were also Vice Chairman Li Ban and Wu Mingluan of the Vietnamese Government Economic Delegation, and the entire delegation. Also present were diplomatic officials from the Vietnamese Embassy in China and Nguyen Van Quang, head of the Permanent Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China.

Attending the signing ceremony were also relevant officials from our country, including Wen Yucheng, Han Nianlong, Li Qiang, Zhang Xianyue, and Xie Huai.

The Vietnamese Government Economic Delegation led by Vice Premier Le Quyen concluded its friendly visit to our country and departed from Beijing by special plane today.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian and over a thousand revolutionary masses from the capital went to the airport to give them a warm send-off.

The revolutionary masses gathered at the airport held up portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, portraits of the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and banners with the national flags of China and Vietnam, and slogans reading, "Salute to the heroic Vietnamese people!" and "Firmly support the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war!" and so on, expressing that the Chinese people will definitely be the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people.

Vice Premier Le Quyen and Vice Chairman Li Ban and others, accompanied by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, walked around the airport to bid farewell to the welcoming crowds. At this moment, the revolutionary masses waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted slogans: "Long live the brotherly friendship and fighting unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam!" "The Vietnamese people will win, U.S. imperialism will be defeated!" "Down with U.S. imperialism headed by the United States!" "Down with modern revisionism headed by the Soviet revisionist leadership!" "Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" "Long live the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live Chairman Ho Chi Minh!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Those who went to the airport to see them off also included relevant officials from our government departments, the People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, as well as representatives of revolutionary mass organizations in Beijing and five-good soldiers from the garrison in Beijing.

Vietnamese Ambassador to China Vu Mingluan and diplomatic officials from the Vietnamese Embassy, Nguyen Van Quang, head of the Permanent Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, and other Vietnamese friends in Beijing also went to the airport to see them off.
