The revolutionary committee of Xinanlou Middle School in Tianjin, with the help of the stationed People's Liberation Army, organized a study class on Mao Zedong Thought for graduates and their parents. The class focused on criticizing and repudiating the reactionary bourgeois educational line of China's Khrushchev, significantly raising the class consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle among the revolutionary teachers, students, and parents. The graduates enthusiastically posted declarations and applications, expressing their determination to go to the countryside and firmly walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants. This school witnessed a great revolution to fundamentally change the situation where intellectual youth have been detached from labor, reality, and the masses for thousands of years.

Using Mao Zedong's revolutionary line to guide the allocation of graduates

Xinanlou Middle School is a two-session junior middle school with 1,013 graduates this year. Previously, this school was considered an "inferior" school by China's Khrushchev's agents in Tianjin due to its low "admission rate." Every year, during the graduation work, the focus was on increasing the "admission rate" and assigning a large number of homework topics, instilling the revisionist idea of "studying to become an official." For students who firmly followed Chairman Mao's words and wanted to go to the countryside, every effort was made to obstruct them and persuade them to pursue higher education. They tried to lead the youth away from politics, reality, and the laboring people, down the revisionist wrong path, turning them into successors of the bourgeoisie.

Recently, amidst the triumphant songs of the great victory of the Cultural Revolution, the Central Committee of the proletariat, led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, issued a great call to the graduates nationwide to face the countryside, the border, the factories, and the grassroots. After more than two years of tempering and testing in the Cultural Revolution, the entire school's Red Guards and graduates were inspired and posted big-character posters and declarations, strongly demanding to go to the countryside and firmly walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants. In this situation, should we actively and seriously implement Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, or should we follow the old rules and send a few graduates away according to China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational line? Two methods, two lines, were thus sharply and seriously presented before the revolutionary committee.

The revolutionary committee of Xinanlou Middle School, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," organized a study class on Mao Zedong Thought. They seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings that "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor" and "our educational policy should enable the educated to develop morally, intellectually, and physically, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." They exposed and criticized the entire set of revisionist educational lines that China's Khrushchev and his agents in Tianjin had been promoting for a long time, revealing their evil influence on teachers, students, and society. They made everyone realize that whether intellectuals should integrate with workers and peasants is a fundamental difference between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and China's Khrushchev's reactionary bourgeois line. Some students examined their past erroneous thoughts of wanting fame and fortune, realizing they had been poisoned by China's Khrushchev's idea of "studying to become an official." Recently, Zhang Yongqin, one of the first batch to go to Inner Mongolia, said: "I used to want to go to university, become an official, and live a comfortable life. This was poisoned by China's Khrushchev's idea of 'only studying is noble.' I want to go to the countryside and carry a hoe for life, follow Chairman Mao, and do revolution for life, giving China's Khrushchev a resounding slap in the face with my actions." Many teachers and committee members further realized that doing a good job in sending graduates to the countryside is not just about solving the graduates' employment problem, but about whether to implement Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, what ideology to use to run the school, what flag to raise, what path to take, and what kind of people to cultivate. They said with confidence: "Whether you are loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line depends on your actions. We must run the school with Mao Zedong Thought and guide the graduate allocation work with Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, cultivating a batch of reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause."

Criticizing China's Khrushchev's theory of "merging public and private interests"

The revolutionary actions of the Red Guards and graduates firmly demanding to go to the countryside and walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants are in sharp conflict with the old ideas and old concepts of the exploiting classes for thousands of years. Therefore, the struggle between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview must necessarily be strongly reflected in the issue of sending intellectual youth to the countryside. For more than a decade, China's Khrushchev has been corrupting the youth with the bourgeois worldview, vigorously advocating the fallacies of "merging public and private interests" and "public with private interests," opposing Chairman Mao's teachings of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people and "public without private interests." This has blocked the correct path for intellectual youth to integrate with workers and peasants.

The graduates of Xinanlou Middle School, led by the revolutionary committee and the PLA's leftist support personnel, used the "Three Articles" as weapons to severely criticize China's Khrushchev's reactionary bourgeois worldview. Many students, in the great criticism, took Zhang Zide and Dr. Norman Bethune as examples, severely fought against their private thoughts, and denounced China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies that had poisoned them. They further established the proletarian worldview. They said: The core of the proletarian worldview is "public," and the core of the bourgeois worldview is "private." "Private" is the root of revisionism, and all evil comes from "private." Committee member Xu Qingzhen, after signing up, was influenced by the rumors of class enemies and had fluctuations in his thoughts. He felt that going to the countryside was not as good as going to factories and mines, and settling down was not as good as joining the production and construction corps. Through the criticism of China's Khrushchev's theory of "merging public and private interests," he realized that this idea of valuing industry over agriculture was poisoned by China's Khrushchev's theory of "merging public and private interests." He said: "If you don't fight against revisionism, you can't overthrow revisionism; if you don't fight against private interests, you can't establish public interests. I will decide to integrate with the poor and lower-middle peasants for life and use my actions to sentence China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies to death!" Some students, while severely fighting against their private thoughts of "reluctance to leave the city and unwillingness to leave the family," said: No matter how big the family's affairs are, they are small affairs; no matter how small the revolutionary affairs are, they are big affairs. Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their precious lives for the people's interests. Didn't they have families? But they thought of revolution and struggled for the liberation of all humanity, while we only thought of our small families. This is a shameful thought, precisely poisoned by China's Khrushchev's fallacy of "public with private interests." We will firmly walk the bright path that Chairman Mao pointed out, integrating with workers and peasants, and follow Chairman Mao to do revolution for life.

Crushing the enemy's sabotage activities, and firmly deciding to go to the countryside

Sending intellectual youth to the countryside to become ordinary workers and peasants is an important part of carrying out the educational revolution according to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It is a profound class struggle to thoroughly smash China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. A handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists will inevitably interfere from all sides and try every means to sabotage this revolution.

The revolutionary committee of Xinanlou Middle School, while organizing graduates to carry out revolutionary criticism, also paid attention to exposing the enemy's sabotage activities at any time and raising the graduates' class struggle level. A student's father was a historical counter-revolutionary in the countryside undergoing labor reform. At first, the student did not draw a clear line with his family. Classmates helped him say: "Your father stands on the reactionary side and will not agree with you going to the countryside. You must struggle with him." Soon, the student's mother ran to the school and said: "This child's fate is in my hands." She did not agree with her son going to the countryside. Classmates criticized and educated her. In this way, they educated the broad masses of teachers and students, as well as this student and his mother. The student raised his consciousness and signed up to go to the countryside. The living class struggle facts educated everyone: The overthrown exploiting classes are never willing to accept their doom. They will spread rumors and arrows from every corner, create rumors, and engage in sabotage activities. We must never lose revolutionary vigilance and cannot forget class struggle. Some students who had previously had great fluctuations in their thoughts said: "We must raise our revolutionary vigilance, fight against private interests and criticize revisionism, so that the class enemies have no gaps to exploit."

Revolutionary parents encourage their children not to forget class bitterness, and loyal revolutionary young people decide to be good revolutionary successors

Breaking the old system and old habits that those with knowledge cannot be workers or peasants not only touches the souls of intellectual youth but also touches the souls of their parents and every person in society. The revolutionary committee of Xinanlou Middle School, while leading graduates to carry out revolutionary criticism, organized students' parents to hold study classes on Mao Zedong Thought, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's series of teachings on the necessity for intellectual youth to integrate with workers and peasants. They conducted remembrance of bitterness and sweetness, greatly raising the class consciousness of the students' parents, correcting their understanding, and actively supporting their children to go to the countryside and participate in labor.

Tianjin City's Heping District active learner of Chairman Mao's works and revolutionary parent Zhou Yuming, two years ago, actively supported her eldest daughter to go to the border to participate in agricultural construction. This spring, she sent her second son to join the army, and now she is actively supporting her eldest son and second daughter to go to Inner Mongolia's countryside to participate in labor. This was a struggle in her mind. At first, she thought that four children had left, and she felt reluctant. Later, she studied in the class and learned Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," recalling the cruel oppression she suffered in the old society, and raised her class consciousness. Therefore, she resolutely supported the children to go. She said at the parents' meeting: "In class society, love and hate are class-based. If we can start from the party and revolutionary interests, encourage children to go to the countryside and the border, and walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants, this is proletarian love; on the contrary, fearing that children will suffer in the countryside and the border, keeping them in the city, seeking enjoyment, or regarding admission as the only way out, this is bourgeois love. This thought is precisely being deceived by China's Khrushchev and poisoned by revisionism, resulting in harming children and being detrimental to the revolution. Today, I hand over my children to the party and dedicate them to the socialist cause. This is both glorious and our duty!"

At Shu Yi's departure to Inner Mongolia to settle down, his father, an old worker, invited eight young people who were about to go to the countryside to work to his home, had a remembrance of bitterness and sweetness meal, and conducted class education. He told the young people not to forget class bitterness and blood debts. Do not forget that you are the descendants of the working class, fight for Chairman Mao, fight for the working class, and be good children of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Chen Zhibai's parents are both Communist Party members. His father has been sick at home for a few years, and his mother is also sick. The school revolutionary committee, considering the family's difficulties, persuaded him to stay in the city. However, Chen Zhibai's father firmly disagreed, saying: "I have followed Chairman Mao to do revolution for life, let my child follow Chairman Mao to do revolution, and go to take over the revolutionary cause!" With his father's support, Chen Zhibai became more determined to go to the countryside.

Recently, a batch of Red Guards from Xinanlou Middle School have already set off for Inner Mongolia to settle down. The graduates who remained in the school have made full mental preparations, are fully equipped, and are ready to respond to the party's call at any time, stepping onto the bright path of integrating with workers and peasants.

    天津西南楼中学革委会举办以毕业生分配为内容的毛泽东思想学习班
    听毛主席的话，坚决走与工农相结合的道路
    本报讯　天津市西南楼中学革命委员会，在驻校解放军的帮助下，以斗私，批修为纲，组织广大毕业生和毕业生家长，举办毛泽东思想学习班，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫反动的资产阶级教育路线，大大提高了广大革命师生、革命家长的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。广大毕业生纷纷贴出决心书和申请书，要求上山下乡，坚决走与工农相结合的道路。这个学校出现了一场彻底改变千百年来知识青年脱离劳动，脱离实际，脱离群众状况的伟大革命。
    用毛主席的革命路线指导毕业分配的工作
    西南楼中学，是一个二部制的初级中学，本届毕业生有一千零一十三人。过去这个学校一直因“升学率”不高，被中国赫鲁晓夫在天津的代理人视为“等外”学校。每年做毕业生工作时，就要大抓“升学率”，大量布置作业题，灌输“读书做官”的修正主义思想。对一些坚决听毛主席话，要求上山下乡的学生，则千方百计进行阻挠，动员他们升学。极力把青年引诱到脱离政治，脱离实际，脱离劳动人民的修正主义邪路上去，变成资产阶级的接班人。
    最近，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，向全国广大毕业生发出了面向农村、面向边疆、面向工矿、面向基层的伟大号召。经过两年多无产阶级文化大革命锻炼和考验的全校红卫兵小将和毕业生闻风而动，纷纷贴出大字报，决心书，强烈要求上山下乡，坚决走与工农相结合的道路。在这种情况下，是按照毛主席革命路线去积极认真地落实毛主席的这项伟大战略部署呢？还是因循旧规，按照中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线送走几个毕业生了事呢？两种作法，两条路线，就这样尖锐而严肃地摆在革命委员会的面前。
    西南楼中学革命委员会，遵循毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，举办了毛泽东思想学习班，认真地学习了毛主席的“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”的伟大教导，揭露和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在天津的代理人长期以来所推行的一整套修正主义教育路线在师生中和社会上的恶劣影响。使大家认识到，知识分子要不要与工农相结合，这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线的一个原则区别。一些同学检查自己过去一心想成名成家的错误思想，是中了中国赫鲁晓夫“读书做官”的毒害。不久前，首批到内蒙古插队落户的张永琴同学说：“我以前想升大学，将来当干部，过舒适生活，这是中了中国赫鲁晓夫‘唯有读书高’的毒。我要到农村去扛一辈子锄头，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命，用实际行动给中国赫鲁晓夫一个响亮的耳光。”许多教师和革委会成员也进一步认识到，作好毕业生上山下乡工作，不单纯是为了解决毕业生“就业”问题，而是贯彻不贯彻毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，是用什么思想办校，举什么旗，走什么路，培养什么人的问题。他们满怀信心地说：“对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线忠不忠，要看行动。我们一定要用毛泽东思想办校，用毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指导毕业分配工作，培养出一批又一批的无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。”
    狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“公私溶化”论
    红卫兵小将和毕业生坚决要求上山下乡，走与工农相结合的道路的革命行动，同几千年来的剥削阶级旧思想、旧观念存在着尖锐的斗争。因此，无产阶级世界观同资产阶级世界观的斗争，也必然地会在知识青年上山下乡的问题上，强烈地表现出来。十几年来，中国的赫鲁晓夫一直用资产阶级世界观腐蚀青年，极力鼓吹什么“公私溶化”“大公有私”等谬论，同毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民，“大公无私”的教导唱对台戏，堵塞知识青年走与工农相结合的正确道路。
    西南楼中学的广大毕业生，在革命委员会和解放军支左人员的带领下，以“老三篇”为武器，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫反动的资产阶级世界观。许多同学在大批判中，以张思德、白求恩同志为榜样，狠斗私心，控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论对自己的毒害，进一步树立了无产阶级世界观。他们说：无产阶级世界观的核心是“公”字，资产阶级世界观的核心是“私”字，“私”是“修”之根，万恶从“私”字起。校革委会委员徐庆祯同学，在报名以后，由于受了阶级敌人流言蜚语的影响，思想上曾发生过波动，他觉得去农村不如去工厂矿山，插队落户不如到生产建设兵团。通过对中国赫鲁晓夫“公私溶化”论的批判，他认识到这种重工轻农的思想，正是中了中国赫鲁晓夫“公私溶化”论的毒，他说：“批‘修’不斗‘私’，‘修’字批不倒，斗‘私’不批‘修’，‘公’字立不牢。我要决心和贫下中农结合一辈子，用实际行动，宣判中国赫鲁晓夫反动谬论的死刑！”一些同学在狠斗自己“留恋城市，不愿离开家庭”的私心时说：家中的事再大也是小事，革命的事再小也是大事。无数的革命先烈为了人民的利益贡献出了宝贵的生命，难道他们就没有家吗？但是他们想到的是革命，是为解放全人类而奋斗，而自己却只想着小家庭，这是一种多么可耻的念头，这正是受了中国赫鲁晓夫的“大公有私”论的毒。我们坚定地走毛主席指出的与工农相结合的光明大道，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。
      粉碎阶级敌人的破坏活动，
    坚定了上山下乡的决心
    知识青年上山下乡，当普通工人、农民，是按照毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，进行教育革命的重要组成部分。是彻底粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，捍卫毛主席的无产阶级教育路线的深刻的阶级斗争。一小撮叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派，以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，必然要从各方面进行干扰，千方百计破坏这场革命。
    西南楼中学革命委员会，在组织毕业生进行革命大批判的同时，也注意随时揭发阶级敌人的破坏活动，提高毕业生的阶级斗争水平。有一个学生的父亲是历史反革命，在农村劳动改造，这个学生开始与家庭划不清界线。同学们就帮助他说：“你父亲站在反动的立场上，不会同意你上山下乡的，你要和他作斗争。”不久，这个同学的母亲跑到学校里说：“这个孩子的命运掌握在我手心里。”不同意她儿子上山下乡。同学们对她进行了批评和教育。这样，既教育了广大师生，也教育了这个学生和她的母亲。这个学生提高了觉悟，报名要求上山下乡。活生生的阶级斗争的事实，教育了大家：被推翻的剥削阶级总是不甘心他们的灭亡，他们要从各个角落煽阴风，放暗箭，制造流言蜚语，搞破坏活动。我们千万不可丧失革命警惕，不能忘记阶级斗争。一些过去思想波动大的同学说：“我们一定要提高革命警惕，斗私批修，使阶级敌人无缝可钻。”
      革命家长勉励子女不忘阶级
    苦，忠于毛主席的革命小将决心
    做革命的好后代
    打破有了知识就不能当工人、当农民的旧制度，旧习惯，不仅触及到知识青年的灵魂，同时触及到他们的家长以及社会上每一个人的灵魂。西南楼中学革命委员会，在带领毕业生开展革命大批判的同时，组织学生家长举办毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛主席关于知识青年必须与工农相结合的一系列教导，进行忆苦思甜，大大提高了学生家长的阶级觉悟，端正了认识，积极支持自己的子女上山下乡，参加劳动。
    天津市和平区学习毛主席著作积极分子、革命家长周玉明，两年前，她积极支持大女儿去边疆参加农业建设。今年春天，送二儿子参了军，现在又积极支持大儿子和二女儿到内蒙古农村参加劳动。这在她的思想上是有斗争的。一开始她想到，四个孩子都走了，有些舍不得。后来，她在学习班学习了毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，回忆了旧社会所受的残酷压迫，提高了阶级觉悟。因此，她毅然决然地支持孩子们都走。她在家长会上说：“在阶级社会里，爱和恨都是有阶级性的，如果我们能从党和革命的利益出发，鼓励子女去农村，去边疆，走和工农相结合的道路，这是无产阶级的爱；相反，害怕子女到农村、边疆吃苦，让他们留在城市，贪图享受，或者把升学看做唯一出路，这是资产阶级的爱。这种思想，正是上了中国赫鲁晓夫的当，中了修正主义的毒，结果是害了子女，不利于革命。今天我把孩子交给党，献给社会主义事业，既是光荣，也是本分！”
    于舒意同学的父亲是一个老工人。他在于舒意出发到内蒙古插队落户前，把八个即将下乡务农的青年请到家里，吃忆苦思甜饭，进行阶级教育。他告诉青年人，不要忘记阶级苦，血泪仇。不要忘了自己是工人阶级的后代，要为毛主席争气，为工人阶级争气，要当贫下中农的好儿女。陈志白同学的父母亲，都是共产党员，他父亲这几年一直养病在家，他母亲也有病，学校革委会为了照顾他家的困难，动员他留在城市。但是，陈志白的父亲坚决不同意，他说：“我跟着毛主席干了一辈子革命，让我的孩子跟着毛主席干革命，去接革命的班吧！”陈志白在父亲的支持下，更加坚定了上山下乡的信心。
    不久前，西南楼中学的一批红卫兵小将，已经奔赴内蒙古插队落户了。留在学校的毕业生，作好了充分的思想准备，整装待发，随时准备响应党的召唤，踏上与工农相结合的光辉道路。
