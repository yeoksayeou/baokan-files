According to incomplete statistics, in the first half of this year, the military and civilians in the Central Region have eliminated and disintegrated a total of 66,300 enemy forces. Among them, 42,230 enemy forces were killed, wounded, or captured, and 24,070 enemy forces were disintegrated. The enemy's one armored regiment, thirteen battalions (including four U.S. battalions), forty-one companies (including seven U.S. companies), fifty platoons, and one "pacification" team were completely annihilated. Five enemy battalions, nineteen companies, and five platoons were severely damaged.

They sank or damaged 235 enemy ships, shot down, destroyed, or damaged 196 enemy aircraft, captured or forced the surrender of 357 enemy strongholds and outposts, cut off and controlled nearly 30 transportation lines, and seized a large amount of weapons, ammunition, and other military supplies.

In the first half of this year, twenty-eight communes and hundreds of villages were liberated, and more than 300,000 people were freed from enemy rule.

According to the South Vietnam Liberation Communication Society, the military and civilians in the provinces of West Ninh, My Tho, Bien Hoa, Long An, and Quang Nam have recently launched multiple attacks and counter-offensives. They have eliminated a large number of U.S. puppet forces and punitive forces.

On the night of June 29, the liberation army in West Ninh Province launched a fierce attack on the U.S. invading forces stationed in Luc Hiep Commune, north of Thuan Phuoc County. They eliminated 200 enemy forces. On the night of July 3, the liberation army again attacked a U.S. military base near a bridge east-northeast of Thuan Phuoc County. After a 30-minute intense battle, they annihilated a U.S. company. From July 2 to 7, the guerrilla forces in Gia Loc, An Thanh, and Luc Hiep communes in Thuan Phuoc County, in close coordination with local forces, continuously ambushed the enemy on National Highway 1, destroying 15 armored vehicles and eliminating many enemy forces.

Previously, on June 30, the military and civilians in Go Quap County intercepted the enemy five times on National Highway 22 from Go Quap County to West Ninh City, destroying 16 military vehicles and eliminating 210 enemy forces, most of whom were U.S. invading forces.

On July 13, the people's liberation armed forces in My Tho Province intercepted a U.S. invading naval fleet, sinking four enemy ships and damaging six, killing and wounding nearly 500 enemy forces.

On the night of July 5, the liberation army in Bien Hoa Province launched a fierce artillery bombardment on a Thai punitive force base about 20 kilometers southeast of Bien Hoa City. They destroyed the enemy's command building and some barracks, severely damaged the enemy's airstrip, and heavily struck the enemy's artillery positions.

From June 26 to July 5, the military and civilians in Long An Province, in close coordination with the military and civilians in the Saigon-Tan Son Nhat-Cai Lay region, continuously attacked the enemy on National Highway 4, eliminating more than 200 U.S. puppet forces, blowing up three bridges, sinking three ships, destroying multiple military vehicles, and shooting down three enemy aircraft.

In their panic, the enemy aircraft dropped bombs on the U.S. puppet forces, killing more than 20.
