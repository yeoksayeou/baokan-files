Workers in Tokyo's slums stage another protest against government repression
Canadian canal workers maintain strike for three weeks
New Zealand workers from various industries rise up to fight against capitalist exploitation
Ecuadorian students go on strike and bravely clash with police

BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) - According to a report from the East News Agency, about 2,000 workers in the San'ya slum area of Tokyo held a demonstration on the evening of July 9 to protest against the brutal exploitation by Japanese reactionaries and the unreasonable suppression by the police.

At around 6 p.m., approximately 100 workers gathered in Yachiyo Park in San'ya to strongly condemn the Sato reactionary government for dispatching armed police on June 17 to suppress the workers' anti-violence struggle. After the meeting, the workers, full of fighting spirit, marched to the police station to demonstrate. Workers at the front of the demonstration wore helmets with the words "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought" and "Anti-Imperialism," and held high red flags.

The demonstrators received enthusiastic support from workers gathered along the roadside. Workers continuously joined the demonstration, and the demonstration quickly expanded to over 500 people.

The Sato reactionary government mobilized a large number of police, but they were unable to take any action and were completely overwhelmed by the workers' fighting spirit. The demonstrators shouted, "Against police unreasonable suppression!" "Let us organize a government of the working class!" and sang "The Internationale."

During the demonstration, about 2,000 workers gathered in front of the police station, demanding the immediate release of their fellow workers who had been unjustly arrested by the police.

At this time, the Sato government hastily mobilized another 500 armed police in an attempt to suppress the demonstration. The workers were extremely indignant at the brutal suppression by the Sato reactionary government. They threw stones and glass bottles at the police station, breaking the windows. A group of workers attacked another police station, driving the police away with sticks and occupying the police station.

OTTAWA, July 13 (Xinhua) - More than 1,000 ship canal workers in Canada have been on strike for three weeks, demanding wage increases and protesting against the employers' refusal to meet their demands, backed by the reactionary authorities.

This strike has paralyzed more than 270 ships, causing monopoly capitalists to suffer losses of 15 million dollars.

The Canadian ruling class is particularly concerned that this strike will affect Canada's steel industry and other sectors, seriously damaging Canada's economy. This strike has also caused great panic among U.S. shipping companies near Canada's southern lakes, as their business will be greatly affected.

WELLINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) - About 3,000 workers from 33 cold storage factories in New Zealand began a full-scale boycott of loading export products on July 14 to protest against the employers' refusal to meet their demands for wage increases.

Meanwhile, thousands of New Zealand railway workers, printers, forestry workers, steelworkers, and other laborers are also fighting for wage increases and against the brutal exploitation by monopoly capitalists. They have stated that if the capitalists refuse their demands, they will immediately stop working. Faced with the growing workers' movement against monopoly capital, the New Zealand ruling class is in a state of panic, holding emergency meetings to devise measures to deal with the workers' movement.

The leaders of the bourgeois parties and the right-wing leaders of the trade unions are actively working to sabotage the strike by the cold storage workers. They even demand that the cold storage workers cancel their full-scale boycott of loading export products and shout that such actions "harm the national interest and are unforgivable," while also trying to lure the striking workers back to the arbitration court for negotiations. However, the striking workers do not pay any attention to them and continue their struggle.

The New Zealand Communist Party calls on all workers to strengthen their unity, face-to-face with the employers and capitalists, and refuse to return to the arbitration court.

QUITO, July 16 (Xinhua) - Students in Guayaquil, the largest city in Ecuador, defied police repression and held demonstrations in the city center for several days in early July to support the strike by students from several schools in the city and nearby towns to improve educational conditions.

On July 5, students once again took to the streets to demonstrate despite police repression. They threw stones at some government buildings, government vehicles, and the residence of the governor of Guayas Province. In the fierce clashes between students and police, many shops and banks were forced to close that day.

Following the lead of the high school students in Guayaquil, all high school students in Guayas Province began a general strike on July 5, demanding the immediate release of four students who had been unjustly arrested that day.

Meanwhile, in early July, many residents of Guasmo, a town in Chimborazo Province, blocked the Pan-American Highway passing through the area and cut off power from a nearby power plant to other parts of Chimborazo Province to express their outrage at the Ecuadorian authorities' delay in building urgently needed public works.

    各国工人学生斗争继续发展
    东京贫民窟工人再一次示威反抗政府镇压  加拿大航道工人坚持罢工达三星期
    新西兰各业工人奋起斗争反对资本家剥削　厄瓜多尔学生罢课同警察英勇搏斗
    新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：东京山谷贫民窟地区的两千名工人九日晚再次举行示威，抗议日本反动派的残酷剥削和警察当局的无理镇压。
    傍晚六时，大约一百名工人在山谷的玉姬公园举行集会，严厉谴责佐藤反动政府在六月十七日派出武装警察镇压山谷工人的抗暴斗争。会后，工人斗志昂扬地到警察局示威。走在示威队伍前面的工人，戴着写有“毛泽东思想万岁”和“反帝”字样的头盔，高举着红旗。
    示威群众受到聚集在路旁的工人的热烈支持。工人接连不断地参加示威，示威队伍迅速扩大到五百多人。
    佐藤反动政府出动了大批警察，但是他们无法行动，完全被工人的斗志压倒了。示威群众高呼：“反对警察无理镇压！”“让我们组织工人阶级的政府！”并且高唱《国际歌》。
    示威过程中，大约二千名工人聚集在警察局门前，要求立即释放被警察无理逮捕的工友。
    这时，佐藤政府又匆忙出动了五百名武装警察，妄图把示威镇压下去。工人们对佐藤反动政府的野蛮镇压非常愤慨。他们向警察局投掷石块和玻璃瓶，打破警察局的玻璃窗。一批工人袭击了另一个警察局，用棍棒把警察赶走，占领了这个警察局。
    新华社十三日讯　渥太华消息：加拿大一千多名船舶航道工人继续坚持已经进行了三星期之久的罢工，要求增加工资，抗议资方在反动当局的支持下，顽固拒绝工人的要求。
    这次航道工人的罢工，已经使得二百七十多艘船只陷于瘫痪，使垄断资本家损失达一千五百万美元。
    加拿大统治集团特别担心这次罢工将使加拿大钢铁工业等受到影响，从而严重打击加拿大的经济。这次罢工也使得那些靠近加拿大南部湖泊的美国航运公司十分恐慌，因为它们的业务也会受到很大的影响。
    新华社惠灵顿十六日电　新西兰三十三家冷藏工厂的数千名冷藏业工人，十四日开始全面抵制装载出口产品，抗议雇主拒绝工人提出的增加工资的要求。
    与此同时，数千名新西兰铁路工人、印刷工人、林业工人、炼钢工人和其他劳动者也在为增加工资、反对垄断资本家的残酷剥削而进行斗争。他们表示，如果资本家拒绝他们的要求，他们就立即停止工作。面对着日益高涨的工人反对垄断资本的斗争，新西兰统治集团惊慌失措，不断举行紧急会议，策划对付工人运动的措施。
    资产阶级政党头目和工会右翼领导人为了破坏冷藏业工人的罢工斗争，大肆进行活动。他们竟要冷藏业工人取消全面抵制装载出口产品的行动，并且叫嚷这种行动“有损国家的利益，不能原谅”等等，同时还企图诱骗罢工工人回到仲裁法庭进行谈判。但是，罢工工人根本不理他们那一套，继续坚持斗争。
    新西兰共产党号召全体工人加强团结，同雇主和资本家展开面对面的斗争，拒绝回到仲裁法庭上去。
    新华社十六日讯　瓜亚基尔消息：厄瓜多尔最大城市瓜亚基尔市的学生不顾警察镇压七月初连续几天在市中心举行示威游行，支持该市以及邻近几个城镇几所学校的学生为改善教育状况而开展的罢课斗争。
    七月五日这一天，学生们再一次冒着警察的镇压，走上街头举行示威。他们用石块砸了一些政府机关、政府车辆和瓜亚斯省省长的住宅。在学生和警察激烈搏斗的情况下，当天有许多商店和银行都被迫关了门。
    在瓜亚基尔市中学生的带动下，瓜亚斯省全省中学生五日起开始举行总罢课，要求警察立即释放当天无理逮捕的四名学生。
    与此同时，琴博腊索省瓜松托斯镇的许多居民七月初为了抗议厄瓜多尔当局拖延兴建该镇迫切需要的公共工程，封锁了通过当地的泛美公路，并且中断了附近一所发电厂向琴博腊索省其他一些地方的供电，以表示他们的义愤。
