Schools Turned into Markets, Students into Commodities: Soviet Revisionists Push for Profit-Driven Higher Education

	New China News Agency reports: The Soviet revisionist clique recently has been loudly advocating the implementation of capitalist profit principles in Soviet higher education, transforming schools into free-market profit-making entities and students into freely traded commodities.

	Recently, the Soviet revisionist newspaper *Literaturnaya Gazeta* (Literary Gazette) published an article titled "The Ruble and Higher Education" in its 15th issue. The article advocates for the use of the ruble to serve higher education, aligning with the Soviet revisionists' full-scale restoration of capitalism and the "new demands" it places on higher education.

	The article claims that the ruble can "appropriately present the practical demands of higher education, which are constantly changing and becoming more complex," and that the ruble can "prompt higher education to face life."

	The article calls for higher education to engage in free competition and pursue profits. It states: "Higher education institutions can participate in the formulation and implementation of scientific and technological innovations through contracts. Higher education institutions can receive economically justified remuneration for the work they complete, and additionally, they can receive a share of the profits generated by their participation over many years."

	"The ruble, if it starts to truly function, will also allow higher education institutions to express their opinions as executors of design work, scientific research, and experimental contracts."

	"Higher education institutions will obtain a massive financial foundation for new construction, technical equipment, scientific expeditions, improving living conditions and rest, and conducting educational work. These financial resources will not be drawn from the state budget. A portion of the continually increasing profits from the activities of higher education institutions can serve as these funds."

	The article advocates for the free trade of university students as if they were commodities. It proposes that graduates of higher education institutions have a six-month "probation period." If enterprises or institutions deem them to be "fully knowledgeable," they will be included in the roster, and the enterprise will pay the academy the value of training an expert, averaging six thousand rubles. If the graduate is deemed "unfit for work," they will be returned to the original school.

	In the 21st issue of the Soviet revisionist *Literaturnaya Gazeta*, another article continues to advocate that implementing capitalist profit principles in higher education is "wise and timely," and that it is "time for the ruble to 'adapt' to the teaching process of higher education." The article discusses how to "buy a new one" when a young engineer leaves, how to "redeem" a specialist who leaves their post, and how to "assess the price of an engineer," among other topics.

	The reactionary actions of the Brezhnev and Kosygin clique have been strongly condemned by the Soviet people, with some openly declaring "resolute opposition." The further the Soviet revisionist clique strays down the capitalist path, the closer they come to their own demise. Their reactionary rule will not last long.

### 学校变商场　学生成商品  苏修鼓吹在高等学校大搞卢布挂帅

    学校变商场　学生成商品
    苏修鼓吹在高等学校大搞卢布挂帅
    新华社讯　苏修叛徒集团最近大肆鼓吹把在苏联各经济部门实行的资本主义利润原则贯彻到高等学校中去，把高等学校变成自由竞争的赢利机构，把学生变成自由买卖的商品。
    不久前苏修《文学报》第十五期发表一篇题为《卢布和高等学校》的文章，宣扬在高等学校大搞卢布挂帅，“把卢布拿来为高等教育服务”，以适应苏修全面复辟资本主义“向高等学校提出的新要求”。
    文章鼓吹什么，“卢布在许多方面能恰当地提出实践对高等学校不断变化和越来越复杂的要求”，卢布“能促使高等学校面向生活”。
    文章叫嚷要高等学校开展自由竞争，追逐利润。文章说：“高等学校根据合同能参加制订和贯彻科学和技术革新。高等学校由于所完成的工作可以收到经济上有充分根据的报酬，此外还在许多年中可以收到由于它们的参加而构成的利润提成。”
    “如果卢布开始真正起作用，那么高等学校也将作为设计工作、科学研究和实验合同的执行者而发表意见。”
      “高等学校将得到为进行新的建设、技术装备、科学考察、改善生活和休息以及进行教育工作的巨大的财政基础。而这些财政资源将不从国家预算中抽出。高等学校的活动不断增加的利润的一部分可作为这些资金。”
    文章鼓吹象商品一样对大学生进行自由买卖。文章提出，高等学校的毕业生需有半年的“试用期”，如果企业、机关认为“是有完备的学识的，就把他列入编制之内，而企业则付给学院培养一个专家的价值，平均是六千卢布”。如果毕业生被认为“不宜于工作”，就把他退回原学校去。
    苏修《文学报》第二十一期上又发表文章，继续宣扬在高等学校实行资本主义的利润原则是“明智、及时”，“是使卢布‘适应于’高等学校教学过程的时候了”。文章并谈论，“一个青年工程师离开了，怎样再买一个新的”；“专家离职要赎买”；“怎样估量工程师的价格”等等。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团的这些倒行逆施，受到苏联人民的强烈谴责，有人公开表示“坚决反对”。苏修叛徒沿着资本主义的道路走得越远，也就越接近灭亡，他们的反动统治绝不会长久。
