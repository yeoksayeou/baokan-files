In Buenos Aires, workers and students participating in the protest march on the evening of June 28 headed towards the city center's Plaza de Mayo. They bravely resisted the attacks by police, cavalry, and armored units. The police deployed attack dogs, wielded batons, and indiscriminately fired tear gas at the protesters. The protesters retaliated with homemade incendiary bombs from advantageous positions on the streets, and some even threw bricks and tiles from rooftops. One police car was set on fire by an incendiary bomb. Earlier, three bombs had exploded in some government buildings in the capital.

The pro-American dictatorship in Argentina was terrified of the planned nationwide anti-dictatorship protests scheduled for June 28. They mobilized heavily armed police units in the capital and across the 22 provinces to maintain "security." On June 26, Onganía himself held a lengthy meeting with the Minister of the Interior and the police chief to devise methods for suppressing the protests. Despite these efforts, they could not stop the wave of protests by workers and students across the country.

Apart from Buenos Aires, in Córdoba, large crowds held angry protests against the dictatorship. Despite the police's brutal suppression, they gathered at a medical school student center, set up barricades, and launched a fierce assault on the police with homemade incendiary bombs and other projectiles.

In Rosario, over a thousand people took to the streets under the tight surveillance of the military police. They fearlessly fought against the fascist police's tear gas and gunfire.

In La Plata, the protesters toppled several cars to resist the police's advance.

On the eve of the nationwide anti-dictatorship protests, on June 27, in Resistencia, Chaco Province, a thousand students held an anti-dictatorship protest march. Meanwhile, students in Rosario, Córdoba, and Tucumán also clashed multiple times with the dictatorship's military police, with many students being arrested.

Since the pro-American dictatorship of Onganía came to power two years ago, it has been ruthlessly implementing anti-national and anti-people policies. On one hand, it has surrendered to and betrayed national interests to American imperialism, and on the other, it has intensified political repression and economic exploitation of the people. Its reactionary rule has sparked strong resistance from the broad masses of people across various strata.

In recent months, Argentine workers have been continuously fighting against the reactionary economic policies of the dictatorship that have been impoverishing the working people. At the same time, Argentine students have been frequently holding strikes and protests to oppose the reactionary educational policies implemented by the government under American instructions. The current situation indicates that the tide of opposition to the pro-American dictatorship in Argentina is surging higher and higher.

    阿根廷爆发全国性示威反对亲美独裁统治
    各大城市的工人学生不畏强暴英勇反击反动军警镇压
    据新华社二十九日讯布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷全国各大城市的工人和学生，在六月二十八日亲美独裁统治者翁加尼亚发动军事政变上台两周年的这一天，不顾当局的残暴镇压，举行了激烈的反独裁示威，并同全副武装的军警展开了英勇的搏斗。
    在首都布宜诺斯艾利斯，参加示威集会的工人和学生二十八日晚间向市中心的十一号广场进发，他们英勇地抵抗警察、骑兵和装甲部队的进攻。警察出动警犬、挥舞警棍，并疯狂施放催泪弹袭击示威群众，示威群众从街上的有利地点用土制燃烧弹回击，有的人站在屋顶上向下面的警察扔砖瓦。一辆警车被燃烧弹击中起火。早些时候，在首都的一些政府大楼里有三枚炸弹爆炸。
    阿根廷亲美独裁当局对于预定二十八日要在全国各地举行的反独裁大示威怕得要死，他们在首都和全国二十二个省调动大批全副武装的警察部队进行“戒备”。二十六日，翁加尼亚本人并且同内政部长、警察头子等人举行了长时间的会议，策划镇压示威的办法。但是，尽管这样，他们还是无法阻挡全国各地工人、学生的抗议示威洪流。
    除首都布宜诺斯艾利斯外，在科尔多瓦，大批群众举行了愤怒的抗议示威。他们不顾警察的残暴镇压，集中到一个医学院学生中心，设置障碍物，从那里向警察猛烈地投掷土制燃烧弹等物品。
    在罗萨里奥，一千多名群众在军警的严密戒备下冲上街头，他们不畏强暴，在法西斯警察的催泪弹和枪声中同镇压者英勇搏斗。
    在拉普拉塔，示威群众推倒了许多汽车，抵抗警察的进攻。
    在全国性反独裁大示威爆发的前一天，六月二十七日，在查科省雷西斯滕西亚城，有一千名学生举行了反独裁示威游行。与此同时，罗萨里奥、科尔多瓦和图库曼等城市的学生也同独裁政权的军警发生多次战斗，不少学生遭到逮捕。
    翁加尼亚亲美独裁政权上台两年来，疯狂地推行反民族、反人民的政策，它一面向美帝国主义屈膝投降、出卖民族利益，一面加紧对国内人民的政治压迫和经济剥削。它的反动统治激起各阶层广大人民的强烈反抗。
    最近几个月来，阿根廷工人不断展开斗争，反对独裁当局造成劳动人民日益贫困化的反动经济政策。同时，阿根廷学生也不断举行罢课示威，抗议政府在美国指使下实行的反动教育政策。目前的情况表明，阿根廷国内反对亲美独裁统治的浪潮正在越来越高涨。
