The new and old cadres of the Revolutionary Committee of Shandong Postal Administration Bureau, under the guidance of the PLA representatives, have followed the teachings of Chairman Mao, "If our party does not have a large number of new cadres working together with old cadres, our cause will be interrupted." They respect each other, learn from each other, complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, and unite as one to focus on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They have smashed the evil plots of class enemies to split and overthrow the Revolutionary Committee, further consolidating and developing the committee. The entire bureau is now in a great situation of revolution and production.

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Shandong Postal Administration Bureau in March last year, a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and other counter-revolutionaries, unwilling to accept their doom, used various counter-revolutionary tricks to try to destroy the unity between new and old cadres, split the newly formed Revolutionary Committee, and achieve their evil plot of restoring capitalism. The PLA representatives in the committee saw through the enemies' tricks and, following Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle," studied with everyone Chairman Mao's instructions on class struggle and strengthening internal unity, as well as his latest directives on revolutionary committees. Chairman Mao said, "Only through the unity of the Communist Party can we achieve the unity of the whole class and the whole nation, and only through the unity of the whole class and the whole nation can we defeat the enemy and complete the tasks of the national and democratic revolution." Through study, everyone linked the manifestations of class struggle before and after the establishment of the committee, greatly enhancing their awareness of class struggle. They recognized that the unity between new and old cadres is an important link in the unity of the leadership core of the Revolutionary Committee and an important guarantee for consolidating and developing the Revolutionary Committee. Whether or not to maintain the unity between new and old cadres is an important sign of loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Everyone unanimously expressed that they would cherish and strengthen the unity between new and old cadres as they would their own eyes. In launching a fierce attack against a handful of class enemies, they thought and acted as one, supporting and helping each other, fighting side by side, and united against the enemy.

Chairman Mao said, "We advocate active ideological struggle because it is a weapon to achieve unity within the party and revolutionary organizations and make them effective in battle." This bureau's Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's great teachings, paid great attention to building the unity between new and old cadres on the principle basis of Mao Zedong Thought. With the help of the PLA representatives, they often followed Chairman Mao's teachings of "unity-criticism and self-criticism-unity," strictly required themselves, and on the basis of each doing more self-criticism, helped each other and improved together.

Everyone maintained a humble, prudent, and unassuming style of work. When there were achievements, they attributed them to the great leader Chairman Mao, and when there were shortcomings, they took responsibility. Old cadres actively played their leading role, using their relatively rich experience in class struggle and production struggle to focus on revolution and promote production; they used their own experiences of making mistakes to patiently educate and help new cadres, showing concern for the growth of new cadres; at the same time, they humbly learned from the new cadres' firm stance, daring to revolution, and vigorous spirit. New cadres also seriously learned from the old cadres' strengths, actively supported the old cadres' work, protected the old cadres' initiative, and helped the old cadres go deep into the front lines of class struggle and production struggle, blending with the masses and further transforming their worldview.

The Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launched a fierce attack against a handful of class enemies. A handful of class enemies fought desperately, using various tricks to try to confuse the two types of different contradictions and sneak through. Facing the enemies' sabotage, the new and old cadres, with the help of the PLA representatives, studied Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "On Policy," and his latest directives, strictly distinguished between the two types of different contradictions, fully trusted and firmly relied on the revolutionary masses, and always directed the struggle at a handful of class enemies. Thus, the work of cleaning up the class ranks was done steadily, accurately, and fiercely. In the fierce attack against a handful of class enemies, the policy level and leadership art of new cadres were improved; the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of old cadres were also strengthened.

"Reform of state organs is, above all, about connecting with the masses." After being elected as a vice chairman of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, Wang Fengqin continued to maintain close contact with the masses.

    山东邮电管理局革委会在阶级斗争中不断巩固发展
    新老干部互相支持互相帮助并肩战斗
    据新华社济南电　山东省邮电管理局革命委员会的新老干部，在解放军代表的帮助下，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“我们党如果没有广大的新干部同老干部一致合作，我们的事业就会中断”的教导，彼此尊重，互相学习，取长补短，团结一致，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，粉碎了阶级敌人妄图分裂和颠覆革命委员会的罪恶阴谋，使革委会得到进一步巩固和发展，全局革命和生产呈现一派大好局面。
    山东省邮电管理局革命委员会在去年三月份成立后，一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和其他反革命分子，不甘心于自己的灭亡，他们施展各种反革命伎俩，妄图破坏新老干部的团结，分裂新生的革命委员会，实现其复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。革委会中的解放军代表看穿了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，和大家一块学习了毛主席有关阶级斗争和增强内部团结的论述，以及有关革命委员会的一系列最新指示。毛主席教导说：“只有经过共产党的团结，才能达到全阶级和全民族的团结，只有经过全阶级全民族的团结，才能战胜敌人，完成民族和民主革命的任务。”通过学习，大家联系到革委会成立前后阶级斗争的表现，大大提高了阶级斗争观念，认识到新老干部的团结，是革命委员会领导核心团结的一个重要环节，也是巩固和发展革命委员会的一个重要保证。维护不维护新老干部的团结，是忠于不忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的一个重要标志。大家一致表示，要象爱护眼睛一样，维护和加强新老干部的团结。在向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻中，他们心往一处想，劲往一处使，做到了互相支持，互相帮助，并肩作战，共同对敌。
    毛主席教导说：“我们主张积极的思想斗争，因为它是达到党内和革命团体内的团结使之利于战斗的武器。”这个局革命委员会遵照毛主席的伟大教导，十分注意把新老干部的团结，建立在毛泽东思想的原则基础上。在解放军代表的帮助下，他们经常按照毛主席“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的教导，严格要求自己，在各自多做自我批评的基础上，互相帮助，共同提高。
    大家保持着谦虚谨慎、不骄不躁的作风，工作有了成绩，就归功于伟大领袖毛主席，有缺点就主动承担责任。老干部积极发挥自己的骨干作用，利用自己比较丰富的阶级斗争和生产斗争经验，狠抓革命，猛促生产；他们以自己犯错误的经验教训，耐心教育和帮助新干部，热情关心新干部的成长；同时，虚心学习新干部立场坚定，敢于革命，朝气蓬勃等优点。新干部也认真学习老干部的长处，积极支持老干部的工作，保护老干部的积极性，帮助老干部深入到阶级斗争和生产斗争的第一线，和广大群众打成一片，进一步改造自己的世界观。
    革委会紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻中，一小撮阶级敌人拚死顽抗，耍出种种花招，妄图混淆两类不同性质的矛盾，自己蒙混过关。面对阶级敌人的破坏，新老干部在解放军代表的帮助下，学习了毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《论政策》和一系列最新指示，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，充分相信和坚决依靠广大革命群众，始终把斗争矛头指向一小撮阶级敌人，从而使清理阶级队伍的工作做到了稳、准、狠。在向一小撮阶级敌人猛烈进攻中，提高了新干部的政策水平和领导艺术；也加强了老干部的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争观念。（附图片）
    “国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”王凤琴同志被选为陕西省革委会副主任以后，仍然和广大社员群众保持密切的联系。
