Title: Denying the Poor Peasants is to Deny the Revolution

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses harbor a tremendous amount of socialist enthusiasm." In Anhui's Fengyang, Chen Xue Meng took the lead in promoting cooperativization, and in Hebei's Zunhua, Wang Guozhan used three donkeys to start a socialist enterprise. These are vivid examples of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically taking the socialist path.

However, the reactionary novel *Thunderstorm* sings a different tune. It completely erases the socialist enthusiasm of the peasant masses and tramples on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

Chairman Mao points out: "The broad masses of peasants are willing to gradually take the socialist path under the Party's leadership." But what are the "poor and lower-middle peasants" like in *Thunderstorm*? They do not want to organize, saying, "If they are to be organized, 'that would be difficult.'" They do not see the superiority of socialism, believing that mutual aid and cooperation "must result in a loss," and thus are "always worried." They do not see that socialism will inevitably triumph, and thus adopt a passive attitude of "working a few days to get by." In short, the "poor and lower-middle peasants" in the book do not like socialism but are very fond of capitalism.

Chairman Mao points out: "There must be many heroes like Wang Guozhan who, after a resolute struggle, have stood up"; and heroes like Chen Xue Meng "number not just thousands but tens of thousands." But what are the "poor and lower-middle peasants" like in *Thunderstorm*? Yang Xiuying and Huang Daquan need not be mentioned; these poor and lower-middle peasants with deep bitterness and hatred have all become "broken shoes," "lazy bums," and "speculators." Even those "advanced elements": Wan Chunfang, Lu Sucun, He Laojiu, Li Xuecheng... are all gray and dull. Some are living just to find an ideal lover, "love-struck"; some are content with just "warm clothes, full stomachs, and good housing," ordinary people; some are "parasites" who "eat today, ask the government for more tomorrow, and when it's gone, go to the government for more the day after. Year after year, the same old story." In short, the "poor and lower-middle peasants" in the book are either "broken shoes," "lazy bums," "drunks," or ignorant, selfish, and backward.

This is a vicious slander against the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants!

On the socialist path, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are spirited and full of fighting spirit, braving evil winds and turbulent waves, showing how high their revolutionary enthusiasm is! In the struggle to change the face of "poverty and blankness," the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants fight against nature, fight against the land, and fight against class enemies, creating countless moving and inspiring deeds! However, the counterrevolutionary element Chen Dengke sees none of this. He wields his black pen, smearing the poor and lower-middle peasants with ignorance, backwardness, and selfishness, and loading them with capitalist black goods, fully exposing himself as a lackey of the Chinese Khrushchev and a sworn enemy of us broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

The reactionary novel *Thunderstorm* portrays the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants as not wanting socialism but liking capitalism, and there is a reason for this. The Chinese Khrushchev slanders the advocacy of cooperativization as "a mistaken, dangerous, utopian agricultural socialist thought." He also loudly proclaims: "Hiring workers, individual farming, should be left to their own devices, let them have three horses and a plow, that would be fine." It turns out that Chen Dengke is peddling the black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev, slandering the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants as shaking their heads at socialism and clapping their hands at capitalism, aiming to clear the way for the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism.

Chen Dengke portrays the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants as selfish, backward, and stupid, and he has a "theory" for this. He uses the mouth of a certain young activist, Lu Sucun, in the book to say: "People also have several grades, upper-class people, even if not beaten, are still people; lower-class people, even if beaten to death, are not people." It turns out that Chen Dengke portrays the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants as miserable and ignorant, aiming to let the "saviors" and "upper-class people" like the Chinese Khrushchev and Zhu Yongkang lord over us, wielding power and privilege; and to let the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants become "lower-class people" again, to be used and driven by them. Their wolfish ambitions are extremely vicious!

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution. If you deny them, you deny the revolution. If you strike them, you strike the revolution." Looking through our revolutionary struggle history, those who slander and oppose the peasant revolution have all been overthrown by the broad masses of peasants. The Chinese Khrushchev clique and their lackey Chen Dengke defame and oppose the poor and lower-middle peasants, and we broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants will give them the same fate: knock them down and stomp on them with our feet!

    否认贫农，便是否认革命
    北京市第二通用机械厂  孟克勤
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义的积极性。”安徽凤阳陈学孟带头搞合作化，河北遵化王国藩用三条驴腿创起社会主义的家业，正是广大贫下中农积极走社会主义道路的生动写照。
    反动小说《风雷》却大唱反调，它把农民群众的社会主义积极性抹得一干二净，它把广大贫下中农糟踏得不成样子。
    毛主席指出：“广大农民是愿意在党的领导下逐步地走上社会主义道路的”。《风雷》里的“贫下中农”是怎样的呢？他们不愿意组织起来，说什么要他们组织起来“那就难了”。他们看不到社会主义的优越性，认为搞互助合作“必定吃亏”，因而“时时提心吊胆”。他们看不到社会主义必然要胜利，因而采取“干几天应付应付”的消极态度。一句话，书里的“贫下中农”对社会主义不喜欢，对资本主义倒十分留恋。
    毛主席指出：象王国藩这样“经过坚决奋斗，翻过身来”的英雄事迹，“各地一定很多”；象陈学孟这类英雄人物，又“何止成千上万”。《风雷》里的“贫下中农”是怎样的呢？羊秀英、黄大权不用说了，这些苦大仇深的贫下中农，一个个都成了“破鞋”、“懒汉”、“投机倒把分子”；就是那些“先进人物”：万春芳、陆素云、何老九、李学成……，也都是灰不溜丢的。有的是活着就是为了找个理想爱人的“爱情迷”；有的是只图“穿得暖暖，吃得饱饱，住得好好”的庸人；有的是“今天吃了，明天向政府去要，后天光了，再到政府去领。年年如此，岁岁照旧”的寄生虫。一句话，书里的“贫下中农”不是“破鞋”、“懒汉”、“酒徒”，就是愚昧、自私、落后。
    这是对广大贫下中农恶毒的污蔑！
    在社会主义的道路上，广大贫下中农精神振奋，斗志昂扬，迎恶风，战浊浪，显示了多么高涨的革命热情！在改变“一穷二白”面貌的斗争中，广大贫下中农与天斗，与地斗，与阶级敌人斗，创造了多少可歌可泣的动人事迹！反革命分子陈登科却一概看不见，他摇动黑笔杆，把什么愚昧呀、落后呀、自私呀，一股劲地往贫下中农的脸上抹，把那些个人发家致富的资本主义黑货，一股劲地往贫下中农的身上装，这就充分暴露了他是中国赫鲁晓夫的走卒，我们广大贫下中农的死敌。
    反动小说《风雷》把广大贫下中农写成不要社会主义，喜欢资本主义，是有来头的。中国赫鲁晓夫污蔑合作化的主张是“一种错误的、危险的、空想的农业社会主义思想。”他还大肆叫嚷：“雇工，单干，应该放任自流，让他都有三匹马一副犁就很好”。原来，陈登科贩卖的是中国赫鲁晓夫的黑货，他把广大贫下中农污蔑成见社会主义就摇头，见资本主义就拍手，目的是为中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义鸣锣开道。
    陈登科把广大贫下中农写得自私、落后、愚蠢是有“理论”的。他借书中的一个所谓青年积极分子陆素云之口说：“人，也有几十等人，上等人，不打也成人；下等人，打死也不成人。”原来，陈登科把广大贫下中农写得乌七八糟、愚昧无知，目的是要让中国赫鲁晓夫、祝永康这样的“救世主”、“上等人”高踞在我们头上，作威作福；让广大贫下中农重新做“下等人”，供他们使唤驱遣，狼子野心，何等狠毒！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“没有贫农，便没有革命。若否认他们，便是否认革命。若打击他们，便是打击革命。”翻开我们的革命斗争史，那些污蔑和反对农民革命的人，都被广大农民群众打翻在地。中国赫鲁晓夫一伙和他的走卒陈登科丑化、反对贫下中农，我们广大贫下中农也只能给他们同样的下场：把他们打翻在地，并踏上一只脚！
