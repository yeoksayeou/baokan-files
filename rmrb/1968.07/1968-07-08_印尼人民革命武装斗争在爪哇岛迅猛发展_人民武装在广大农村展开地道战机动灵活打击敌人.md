The Indonesian people's armed revolutionary struggle is rapidly developing in the vast rural areas of Java Island.

According to a message from Western news agencies on July 2, "The Communist Party's forces have already taken control of a dense forest area in East Java and turned it into an 'impregnable fortress.'" The message quotes the head of the East Java police, Kuswadi, as saying, "The Communists have seized the southern region... The Communist forces are really strong, and the armed forces cannot enter the Communist base in this region."

Since the beginning of this year, the Indonesian Communist Party and revolutionary people have been waging armed revolutionary struggles in the rural areas of Tulungagung, Wringin, Ngawi, Trenggalek, Wonosobo, Ngawi, and Malang in the southern part of East Java. According to reports from Indonesian reactionary newspapers, in the past half year, the people's armed forces in this region have executed more than one hundred reactionary officials, landlords, and other counter-revolutionary elements. These counter-revolutionaries are the executioners who, after the October 1965 counter-revolutionary coup by the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique, brutally massacred Indonesian Communist Party members and patriotic people, with blood on their hands and heinous crimes.

According to a recent report from the Indonesian official mouthpiece, Antara News Agency, the Indonesian people's armed forces in the vast rural areas of East and Central Java have also launched guerrilla warfare, using tunnels to fight against the fascist army. The report says that these tunnels have become "hidden bases" for the people's armed forces, who are flexibly and mobilely striking the invading enemy.

According to a message from Western news agencies on July 3, quoting the reactionary newspaper "Kami" from Jakarta, in West Java, which is under the strict control of the fascist regime, "a group of about eighty Communist Party members have been active recently and have already exchanged fire with the government army several times." The message reveals that this active people's armed force in the Lebak region has also mobilized local farmers to carry out struggles to eliminate traitors and tyrants.

    印尼人民革命武装斗争在爪哇岛迅猛发展
    人民武装在广大农村展开地道战机动灵活打击敌人
    新华社五日讯　雅加达消息：在印度尼西亚爪哇岛的广大农村，人民革命武装斗争风暴正在迅猛发展。
    据西方通讯社二日发自雅加达的一则消息透露：“（印尼）共产党部队已经控制了东爪哇一个密林地区，并把它建成一个‘不易攻破的堡垒’。”消息援引东爪哇警察头目库斯瓦迪的话说：“共产党已夺去了（东爪哇）南部地区。……共产党实在坚强，武装部队无法进入这个地区的共产党基地。”
    印尼共产党人和革命人民自今年一月起就在东爪哇南部地区的土隆阿贡、勿里达、谏义里、任抹、外南梦、新埠头、玛琅等地区的农村展开了革命武装斗争。据印尼反动报纸透露，半年来人民武装力量在这一地区处决了一百多个反动官吏、恶霸地主和其他反革命分子。这些反革命分子都是一九六五年十月苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团发动反革命政变以后，血腥屠杀印尼共产党人和爱国人民的血债累累、罪恶滔天的刽子手。
    据印尼官方喉舌安塔拉通讯社最近透露，印尼人民武装力量在东爪哇和中爪哇广大农村，还展开了地道战，运用地道同法西斯军队进行战斗。消息说，这些地道成为人民武装力量的“隐蔽处和基地”，人民武装力量机动灵活地打击来犯的敌人。
    另据西方通讯社三日援引雅加达反动报纸《卡米报》的消息透露，在法西斯政权严密控制下的西爪哇，最近“有一支约八十人的共产党队伍在活动，并且已经好几次同政府军交火”。消息透露，这支活跃在勒巴克地区的人民武装力量还发动当地农民，开展了除奸反霸的斗争。
