One day, a horse-drawn carriage's horses were startled, and the four horses pulling the carriage ran wildly, posing a great danger. A soldier of the People's Liberation Army bravely controlled the startled horses for thirty meters, giving the revolutionary masses time to escape, but he himself was seriously injured.

In March of this year, a soldier named Hu Bingquan from the Third Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army was walking briskly down the bustling streets of Wusu on his way to the company.

About fifty meters from the intersection on the west side of the road, a large four-horse wagon was parked. Suddenly, a car came towards the wagon, startling the four horses. The driver noticed and quickly applied the brakes. The horses, hearing the screeching of the brakes, reared up and made a 180-degree turn to the right, heading towards the intersection.

At this critical moment, Hu Bingquan turned around and saw the four startled horses dragging the wagon, about to plow into the crowd in front. A serious accident was about to happen. At this moment of extreme danger, a loud voice echoed in his ears:

"We are a people's army. We are here to liberate the people. We are thoroughly dedicated to the people's interests."

The great teacher Chairman Mao waves his mighty hand, and the revolutionary soldiers pledge their loyalty! Hu Bingquan's boundless devotion to Chairman Mao turned into boundless courage and infinite strength. He decided, "I am willing to break every bone in my body, but I will not let the people suffer a scratch!"

The startled horses ran wildly down the street, their hooves and wheels shaking the ground. The lives of the masses were in grave danger.

"Get out of the way!" Hu Bingquan shouted, leaping into the street. He quickly pushed a stunned child out of harm's way and rushed towards the rampaging horses. He grabbed the reins with one hand and the bridle of the middle horse with the other, using all his strength to push back, trying to stop the horses.

The four startled horses kicked and struggled wildly. Hu Bingquan's clothes were torn, and his body was trampled. The horse's head swung and hit his cheek, blood flowing from his mouth. The path of the wagon was marked with streaks of blood.

"The army has an indomitable spirit. It will trample all enemies and will never be subdued by the enemy." The invincible thoughts of Mao Zedong gave Hu Bingquan renewed strength and greater courage. He recited, "Resolve to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory." He clenched his teeth and endured the pain. He knew that every second he held on would give the revolutionary masses more time to escape; every second he held on would add to his loyalty to Chairman Mao. So, he did not let go of the reins, pressing his body against the chest of the rampaging horses, struggling with the horses for thirty meters. Every meter was soaked with the revolutionary soldier's blood, every meter was a testament to the revolutionary soldier's loyalty to Chairman Mao.

Suddenly, one of the startled horses reared up and kicked with its front hooves, striking Hu Bingquan's lower cheek. He immediately collapsed to the ground, and the wagon wheel rolled over his chest.

Because Hu Bingquan struggled with the startled horses for over thirty meters, he slowed down the wagon, giving the revolutionary masses time to escape and avoiding a serious accident.

When Hu Bingquan fell, the more than three hundred revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups who had escaped rushed forward, quickly lifting the hero who had sacrificed himself to save others and rushing him to the hospital.

"Car! Car!" Hu Bingquan, in a state of semi-consciousness, weakly called out, his clenched fists still in the posture of struggling with the startled horses.

The revolutionary soldiers love the people, and the people love the soldiers. The heroic deed of Hu Bingquan in protecting the masses spread rapidly throughout the cities and countryside of Wusu, resonating in the hearts of millions under the Tian Shan Mountains. In the Wusu region, offices, schools, factories, neighborhoods, communes, and military camps were all decorated with large banners reading, "Learn from Comrade Hu Bingquan!" and "Salute to Comrade Hu Bingquan!" Revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups and Red Guards, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao, Mao badges, and Chairman Mao's works, rushed to the hospital to visit the heroic soldier Hu Bingquan. The people resolved to take the hero as an example and be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao.

### “宁愿自己筋骨碎，不让人民伤分毫”

    “宁愿自己筋骨碎，不让人民伤分毫”
    有一天，一辆马车上的马受惊了，四匹马拉着马车飞跑，十分危险。解放军战士奋力控制惊马三十米远，使革命群众赢得脱险时间，他自己却光荣地负了重伤。
    今年三月，解放军某部三营通信员胡炳全踏上热闹的乌苏街道，大踏步地向连队走去。
    距离十字路口五十多米的西头路旁，停放着一辆四套马的胶轮大车。忽然，一辆汽车迎着马车开来，四匹马立即惊恐万状。司机发现，急忙刹车。四匹马听到汽车急刹车的响声，就腾起前蹄，向右来了个一百八十度的大转弯，调头向十字路口冲去。
    这时，胡炳全回头一看，四匹惊马拖着大车，眼看要冲进前面的人群，一场严重的车祸就要发生。在这万分危急关头，一个洪亮的声音在他耳边回响：
      “我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”
    伟大导师毛主席挥巨手，革命战士献忠心！胡炳全无限忠于毛主席的满腔激情，化为无限的勇气，无穷的力量，他决心“宁愿自己筋骨碎，不让人民伤分毫！”
    惊马烈性大发，顺街直下，马蹄声，车轮声，震得地打颤，群众的生命危在眉睫。
      “快闪开！”胡炳全高喊着，跃上街心，随手将一个呆立着的小孩推出险境，迎着狂奔的惊马猛冲上去，一手抓住连缰，一手抓住中间鞘马的笼头，拚着全力向后推，企图阻止惊马前进。
    四匹惊马拚命狂奔，乱踢乱踏。胡炳全的衣服被撕破，身上被踢伤。马头猛甩在他的脸颊上，鲜血顺嘴直流，惊车过处，留下了斑斑血迹。
      “这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”战无不胜的毛泽东思想使胡炳全力倍添，胆更壮。他默诵着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”咬紧牙关，忍着剧痛。他明白，多坚持一秒钟，就可以使革命群众有多一秒钟脱险的时间；多坚持一秒钟，对毛主席的忠心就增加一分。于是，死不松缰，紧贴马胸，全身抗住狂奔的惊马，坚持和惊马搏斗了三十米。这三十米啊，每一米都洒下了革命战士的热血，每一米都凝聚着革命战士对毛主席的赤胆忠心。
    突然，一匹惊马前肢高扬，猛力下刨，铁蹄刨中胡炳全的下颊，他当即昏倒在地，车轮从他胸部辗过。
    由于胡炳全与惊马经过三十多米的搏斗，减慢了马车的速度，使革命群众赢得了脱险的时间，避免了一场严重的车祸。
    当着胡炳全倒下去的时候，脱险的三百多名各族革命群众一拥而上，急忙把舍己救人的英雄抱起，迅速送往医院。
    “车！车！”处在昏迷状态中的胡炳全同志，不时地发出微弱的呼声，紧握的两手还作出与惊马搏斗的姿势。
    革命战士爱人民，人民热爱子弟兵。胡炳全英勇保卫群众的事迹，乘着无产阶级文化大革命的东风，飞速地传遍了乌苏城乡，飞扬在天山脚下，激荡在千万个人的心头。乌苏地区的机关、学校、工厂、街坊、公社、军营，到处都刷写了“向胡炳全同志学习！”“向胡炳全同志致敬！”的大幅标语。各族革命群众和红卫兵小将，带着毛主席像、毛主席像章和毛主席著作，涌到医院探望英雄战士胡炳全。人们决心以英雄为榜样，无限忠于毛主席。
