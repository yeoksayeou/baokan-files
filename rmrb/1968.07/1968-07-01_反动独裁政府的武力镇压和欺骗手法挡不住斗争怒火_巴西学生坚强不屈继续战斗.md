The reactionary dictatorial government's brutal suppression and deceptive tactics cannot stop the fierce struggle. Brazilian students remain steadfast and continue to fight.

New York, June 29th: Brazilian students are not falling for the tricks of the reactionaries. They do not heed the dictatorial government's so-called "educational reform" deception and continue their struggle. They oppose American cultural imperialism, oppose the sinister rule of the pro-American dictatorship, demand reforms to the corrupt educational system, and call for the release of detained students.

The recent wave of anti-American and anti-dictatorship struggles by Brazilian students has left the reactionary authorities in a state of panic. While intensifying the suppression of student movements, the reactionary authorities are also constantly using deceptive tactics in an attempt to extinguish the burgeoning student struggles. On the 27th, Brazilian President Costa e Silva hypocritically announced the establishment of a so-called "working group" for "educational reform" and demanded that students engage with this group. At the same time, the reactionary government's education minister claimed that he "promised" to allocate 34 million new cruzeiros (equivalent to 1.06 million U.S. dollars) for use by 23 universities in the second half of the year.

However, on the same day, students in several cities continued to hold demonstrations. In Fortaleza, the capital of Ceará State, 10,000 students held a demonstration to protest the bloody suppression of students by reactionary police and to demand the release of detained students. Students in Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais State, held demonstrations despite the brutal suppression by the police. In Porto Alegre, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul State, federal university students occupied the philosophy department; in São Paulo, students and teachers from a university also occupied the philosophy and economics departments. Students in Salvador, the capital of Bahia State, boycotted classes to protest police brutality.

According to reports, several student leaders have clearly stated that they refuse to engage with the so-called "working group" for "educational reform." They pointed out that this is a conspiracy by the dictatorship to deceive the people. These student leaders emphasized that if the dictatorship does not meet the students' demands, they will continue to hold large-scale demonstrations in cities across the country to expose the dictatorship's conspiracies and tricks.

    反动独裁政府的武力镇压和欺骗手法挡不住斗争怒火
    巴西学生坚强不屈继续战斗
    新华社二十九日讯里约热内卢消息：巴西学生不上反动派的当，不理会独裁政府提出的所谓
  “教育制度改革”的欺骗花招，继续进行斗争，反对美帝文化侵略，反对亲美独裁政权的罪恶统治，要求改革腐朽的教育制度和释放被捕的学生。
    巴西学生最近以来掀起的反美反独裁斗争的新风暴，使巴西反动当局惊惶万状。反动当局在对学生斗争加紧武力镇压的同时，不断玩弄欺骗手法，妄图扑灭蓬勃发展的学生斗争。巴西总统科斯塔—席尔瓦二十七日假惺惺地宣布成立所谓“教育制度改革”的“工作小组”，并且要求学生同这个小组进行接触。同时，反动政府的教育部长声称，他“答应”拨三千四百万新克鲁赛罗（合一千零六十万美元），“供二十三所大学在下半年使用”。
    但是就在同一天，有好几个城市的学生继续举行示威游行。在西阿拉州首府福塔雷萨，有一万名学生举行示威游行，抗议反动警察血腥镇压学生的罪行，并要求释放被捕的学生。米纳斯吉拉斯州首府贝洛奥里藏特的学生不顾警察的残酷镇压，也举行了示威游行。在南里约格朗德州首府阿雷格里港，联邦大学的学生占领了哲学系；在圣保罗，一所大学的学生和教师也占领了哲学系和经济系。巴伊亚州首府萨尔瓦多的学生为了抗议警察的暴行，抵制上课。
    据报道，有几个学生领导人已经明确表示，拒绝同所谓的“教育制度改革”的“工作小组”接触。他们指出，这是独裁政权的一种蛊惑人心的阴谋。这些学生领导人强调说，如果独裁政府不满足学生们提出的要求，他们将在全国各城市继续举行大规模的示威游行，揭露独裁政府的阴谋诡计。（附图片）
