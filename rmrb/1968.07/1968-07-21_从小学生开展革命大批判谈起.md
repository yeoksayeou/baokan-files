One day, the school held a meeting for teachers to criticize the revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev, and a few students were also invited to participate. Halfway through the meeting, a student suddenly stood up and said, "This meeting is too dull, there's no 'gunpowder' in it. It's better for the teachers to attend our criticism meetings." After saying this, a few students left the meeting room.

This incident happened suddenly, and we were completely unprepared. Originally, among the members of our revolutionary committee, there was a widespread belief that primary school students are young and know little, so revolutionary criticism in primary schools could only be carried out among teachers. Therefore, we did not pay much attention to revolutionary criticism among students. Later, we participated in a few criticism meetings organized by the students themselves and found that they were very enthusiastic and vigorous in carrying out revolutionary criticism, with strong "gunpowder" in their speeches, and their level of analysis and criticism was not low. At a meeting criticizing China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational line, a young student spoke: "One day in class, the teacher asked me to write a revolutionary slogan. After I finished, I asked the teacher if I could get five points. Because in the past, it was always said that getting five points is a good student. Now I know that this is the poison that China's Khrushchev has given us. He wants us to only chase after five points, not listen to Chairman Mao's words, not love the worker uncles and peasant uncles; he wants us not to take over the class of the proletariat, but to take over the class of the bourgeoisie. We will not fall for this bastard's trick!"

This student's speech educated us: although primary school students are young, they were born in a new society, grew up under the red flag, and have been nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought since they were young. They have also been tempered and influenced by the two-year Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. As long as we fully mobilize them, we can definitely carry out revolutionary criticism well. Then, why did we not pay attention to carrying out revolutionary criticism among primary school students in the past? Upon examination, the fundamental problem is that we have not firmly established the belief in relying on the masses and following the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao in our minds. In our minds, we actually did not regard primary school students as objects of belief and reliance; or in some matters, we believed and relied on them, but in matters of revolutionary criticism, we did not believe and rely on them.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, we must rely on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in schools, and rely on the activists among them, that is, the proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end." Believing in the masses, relying on the masses, respecting the pioneering spirit of the masses, and letting the masses rise up in revolution, liberate themselves, and educate themselves, this is the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and it is also the traditional style of our party. Our revolutionary committee must lead all revolutionary teachers and students in the school to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, carry out the educational revolution, thoroughly criticize and eliminate the influence of China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational line, and turn our school into a red Mao Zedong Thought school. To do this, we must inherit and carry forward the traditional style of the party in the revolutionary committee, truly implement the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao in every piece of work, and mobilize the masses, fully rely on revolutionary students and teachers, and fight a "people's war."

    从小学生开展革命大批判谈起
    北京白纸坊西街小学革委会主任　程庆斌
    有一天，学校里的教师开会批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线，也请了几个同学参加。会议开到一半，一个同学忽地站起来说：“这个会开得太沉闷了，没有什么‘火药味’，还是请老师去参加我们的批判会吧。”说完，几个同学就退出了会场。
    这件事发生得很突然，我们完全没有思想准备。原来，在我们革委会的成员当中，普遍存在着一种思想，认为小学生年纪小，知道的事情少，小学校的革命大批判，只能在教师里进行。因此，对学生中的革命大批判，一直没有很好地抓。后来，我们去参加了几次同学们自己组织的批判会，发现他们开展革命大批判的热情很高，劲头很大，批判发言的“火药味”很浓，分析批判的水平不低的。在一次批判中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的大会上，一个小同学发言说：有一天上课，老师叫我写一句革命口号，我写完了就问老师，能不能得五分。因为过去总是说，得五分才是好学生。现在我才知道，这就是中国赫鲁晓夫给我们制造的毒药。他是想叫我们光去追求五分，不听毛主席的话，不爱工人叔叔和农民伯伯；想叫我们不去接无产阶级的班，而去接资产阶级的班。我们决不上这个坏蛋的当！
    这个小同学的发言教育了我们：小学生年龄虽然比较小，但是，他们生在新社会，长在红旗下，从小受到毛泽东思想的哺育，又受了两年来无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼和影响，只要我们把他们充分发动起来，完全能够把革命大批判搞好。那么，为什么过去在小学生里开展革命大批判这件事没有引起我们的重视呢？检查起来，最根本的问题，还是没有从思想上牢固地树立起相信群众、依靠群众的观点，没有坚决按照毛主席的无产阶级革命路线办事。在我们的思想上，实际上没有把小学生看作相信和依靠的对象；或者是在一些事情上相信和依靠他们，在革命大批判这类事情上又不相信他们，不依靠他们。
    毛主席教导我们说：“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，让群众自己起来革命，自己解放自己，自己教育自己，这就是毛主席无产阶级革命路线，也是我们党的传统作风。我们的革委会，要率领全校革命师生，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，搞好教育革命，彻底批判和肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线的流毒，把我们的学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，就要在革委会里继承和发扬党的传统作风，真正把毛主席的无产阶级革命路线贯彻到每一件工作中去，就要放手发动群众，充分依靠革命的学生和教师，打一场“人民战争”。
