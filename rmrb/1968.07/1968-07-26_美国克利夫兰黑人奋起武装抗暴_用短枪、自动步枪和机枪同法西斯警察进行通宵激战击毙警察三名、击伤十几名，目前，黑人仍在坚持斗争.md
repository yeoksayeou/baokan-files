The black residents of Cleveland bravely took up arms on the night of the 23rd, launching a fierce attack on the fascist police who routinely oppress them. After a night of intense battle, they killed three reactionary police officers and injured more than a dozen, delivering a severe blow to the American ruling class.

On the night of the 23rd, when a fascist police car was rampaging through the black neighborhoods in Cleveland, the police inside were arrogantly interrogating passersby. Some armed blacks, unable to bear it any longer, fired at the police car. The car was riddled with bullets and fled in disarray. When a large number of police, equipped with armored vehicles, weapons, and tear gas, arrived to suppress the uprising, these armed blacks bravely retaliated with pistols, automatic rifles, and machine guns from rooftops, windows, and behind cars. The concentrated firepower of the blacks left the police, who usually lorded over them, dead or wounded. The remaining police hid under cars, calling for reinforcements.

At the same time, large numbers of black residents rushed to join the fight from all directions. They overturned police cars and white supremacist vehicles, setting them on fire; they also threw homemade Molotov cocktails at the stores of white supremacists who had been exploiting them, setting a two-mile stretch of the street ablaze. In other black neighborhoods in the city, similar uprisings broke out, further exhausting the reactionary ruling class.

The gunfire and flames of the black resistance in Cleveland caused Ohio Governor Rhodes, who was attending the National Governors Conference in Cincinnati, to panic. He did not even wait to hear the end of the speech by the head of the American ruling class, Johnson, before rushing out of the venue and back to his office in Columbus to prepare for a large-scale suppression. On the morning of the 24th, Rhodes brazenly mobilized 2,600 National Guardsmen to enter the black neighborhoods of Cleveland and ordered the military police to "shoot to kill" the blacks who were resisting. However, the blacks of Cleveland, fearless of violence and willing to sacrifice, continued to fight bravely and tenaciously.

Cleveland is the seventh-largest city in the United States, with a population of over 800,000, of which more than 300,000 are black. The blacks of Cleveland have a tradition of resisting oppression. In August 1966, Cleveland saw a large-scale armed resistance by blacks that lasted for six days, striking fear into the hearts of the American ruling class.

In addition, from the 20th to the 22nd, in Benton Harbor, Michigan, black youth fought against the police for three consecutive nights, using stones and Molotov cocktails to fight back against the police, leaving them in disarray.

From the 20th to the 23rd, the residents of the Puerto Rican slums in New York City, in protest against the deployment of specially trained tactical patrol units in their area, fought against the patrol units for four consecutive nights using bottles and other makeshift weapons.

    美国克利夫兰黑人奋起武装抗暴
    用短枪、自动步枪和机枪同法西斯警察进行通宵激战击毙警察三名、击伤十几名，目前，黑人仍在坚持斗争
    据新华社二十四日讯　华盛顿消息：美国克利夫兰市的黑人群众二十三日晚英勇地拿起武器，猛烈袭击平时残酷镇压他们的法西斯警察，经过通宵激战，打死反动警察三名，打伤了十几名，给美国反动统治集团以严重打击。
    二十三日晚，当一辆法西斯警车在克利夫兰市黑人区横冲直撞，车上警察蛮横地盘问行人时，一些带枪的黑人忍无可忍，毅然向警车开火，这辆警车被打得遍体弹孔，狼狈逃窜。当大批警察乘坐着装甲车，携带着大批武器和催泪瓦斯前来镇压时，这些带枪的黑人用短枪、自动步枪和机关枪从屋顶上、窗户里、汽车旁英勇地进行回击。黑人的密集的火力，把那些平时骑在黑人头上作威作福的警察，打得死的死，伤的伤。其他的警察一个个钻到汽车底下，呼号增援。
    与此同时，大批黑人群众从各方面涌来助战，他们推倒了警车和白人种族主义者的汽车，把它们放火烧掉；他们还用自制燃烧瓶向平时盘剥他们的白人种族主义者的商店扔去，使长达两英里的一段街区，到处燃起熊熊的烈火。在这个市的其他黑人区，也同时爆发了黑人抗暴斗争的烈火，使得反动统治集团更加疲于奔命。
    克利夫兰市黑人抗暴斗争的枪声和烈火，使得正在辛辛那提市参加全国州长会议的俄亥俄州州长罗兹惊慌万状，他甚至没有来得及听完美国统治集团头子约翰逊的训话，就跌跌撞撞地冲出了会场，赶回哥伦布市他的办公室，布置大规模的镇压。二十四日晨罗兹竟悍然调动二千六百名国民警卫队开进克利夫兰黑人区，并命令军警对进行抗暴斗争的黑人“格杀勿论”。但是克利夫兰市的黑人，不畏强暴，不怕牺牲，英勇顽强地继续坚持斗争。
    克利夫兰市是美国第七个大城市，人口约有八十万以上，其中三十余万是黑人。克利夫兰市的黑人富有抗暴斗争的传统，一九六六年八月克利夫兰市曾爆发持续六天的大规模的黑人武力抗暴斗争，使美国统治集团胆战心惊。
    此外，在密执安州的本顿港，从二十日到二十二日，黑人青年和警察的斗争，已经连续坚持了三个夜晚，他们用石块和燃烧瓶作武器，打得警察狼狈不堪。
    从二十日到二十三日，纽约市波多黎各人贫民区的群众，为了抗议经过特种训练的战术巡逻队进驻这个区，一连四个夜晚用瓶子等作武器，同这个巡逻队进行了激烈的搏斗。
