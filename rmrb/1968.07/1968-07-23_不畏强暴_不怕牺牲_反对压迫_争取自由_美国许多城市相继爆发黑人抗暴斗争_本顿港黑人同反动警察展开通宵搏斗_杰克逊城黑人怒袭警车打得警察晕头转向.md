Despite the brutal suppression by the reactionary ruling clique in the United States against the black people's struggle for racial equality and equal rights, black masses, fearless of tyranny and unafraid of sacrifice, have launched heroic struggles against violence in city after city.

In the industrial city of Akron, Ohio, the struggle of black people against the fascist violence of the police has lasted from the 17th to the 21st. On the 18th, the reactionary authorities declared the city to be in a state of emergency, imposed a curfew, and used other suppression measures to threaten the black masses. However, these suppression measures not only failed to intimidate the black people but instead ignited the flames of their struggle against violence. Angry black youth attacked the military police on sight. Many black youth also used stones and chairs to attack the National Guard.

By the morning of the 21st, the black masses of Akron were still fighting. In addition to destroying the shop windows of white exploiters, attacking military police and police cars with stones, they also set fires in multiple places using homemade Molotov cocktails.

The panicked reactionary authorities hurriedly dispatched an additional 400 National Guard troops on the 21st, joining the 700 National Guard troops sent on the 18th and local police to brutally suppress the black struggle against violence. The reactionary military police had injured and arrested dozens of black masses by then.

On the evening of the 20th, in Benton Harbor, Michigan, about 400 black people took to the streets, smashing the shop windows of white exploiters and burning their stores with homemade Molotov cocktails to protest the discrimination against black customers by a white supremacist store. The police savagely attacked the protesting black people with toxic chemical agents. The enraged black people fought with the reactionary police until the early hours of the 21st.

In Jackson, Michigan, where black people had just launched a struggle against violence at the beginning of the previous week, many black youth attacked police cars on the streets on the evening of the 20th. They were elusive, striking and fleeing, keeping the reactionary police disoriented for over four hours.

    美国许多城市相继爆发黑人抗暴斗争
    本顿港黑人同反动警察展开通宵搏斗　杰克逊城黑人怒袭警车打得警察晕头转向
    新华社二十二日讯　华盛顿消息：尽管美国反动统治集团对美国黑人反对种族压迫、争取平等权利的斗争进行疯狂的镇压，但是，黑人群众不畏强暴、不怕牺牲，在一个又一个的城市里，掀起了英勇的抗暴斗争。
    在俄亥俄州的工业城市阿克伦，黑人抗击警察法西斯暴行的斗争，从十七日到二十一日为止已经坚持了五天。十八日，反动当局宣布这个城市处于紧急状态、实行宵禁，并用其他镇压措施来威胁黑人群众。可是，这些镇压措施非但没有吓倒黑人，反而点燃了黑人群众的抗暴烈火。愤怒的黑人青年见军警就打。许多黑人青年还用石块和椅子袭击国民警卫队。
    到二十一日清晨，阿克伦市的黑人群众仍在坚持斗争。他们除了破坏白人剥削者的商店橱窗、用石块袭击军警和警车外，还用自制燃烧瓶在多处放火。
    惊慌失措的反动当局二十一日慌忙增调四百名国民警卫队，同十八日调去的七百名国民警卫队以及当地警察一起，对黑人抗暴斗争进行疯狂的镇压。反动军警先后打伤和逮捕了数十名黑人群众。
    二十日晚上，在密执安州的本顿港，大约四百名黑人涌到街上砸白人剥削者的商店橱窗，并用自制燃烧瓶焚烧他们的商店，以表示抗议一家白人种族主义者的商店歧视黑人顾客。警察野蛮地向示威黑人施放毒性化学药剂。愤怒的黑人同反动警察搏斗直到二十一日凌晨。
    在上周初刚爆发过黑人抗暴斗争的密执安州杰克逊城，二十日晚上又有许多黑人青年在街上袭击警车，他们神出鬼没，打了就走，连续四个多小时，把反动警察打得晕头转向。
