Not long ago, on a night, the cattle shed in the second production brigade of Toudao Camp, Dongfanghong Commune, Chongli County, Hebei Province, was toppled by a bull. Thanks to the quick rescue by the stationed People's Liberation Army and the poor and lower-middle peasants of the brigade, except for one cow that was crushed to death, the rest of the cattle were safely rescued. The community members, looking at the toppled cattle shed and the dead cow, started discussing on the spot. Some said, "The cattle shed was built not long ago, but now it has collapsed. Those who built it should be held responsible." Some community members disagreed, saying, "This cattle shed was built during the time when China's Khrushchev was spreading the black wind of 'three independences and one contract,' it is the fault of this scoundrel!"

The PLA comrades who were helping the brigade hold study classes were inspired by the community's opinions. They thought: Currently, the brigade is carrying out a revolutionary big-character poster campaign. Since the collapse of the cattle shed is a result of the 'three independences and one contract' black wind, we should use the collapsed cattle shed as a live teaching material to carry out a revolutionary big-character poster campaign.

The revolutionary masses of the second production brigade held a meeting to denounce the crimes of China's Khrushchev at the site of the collapsed cattle shed. At the beginning of the meeting, the poor and lower-middle peasants angrily said, "China's Khrushchev and his agents in this county are promoting 'three independences and one contract,' trying to use the bourgeois 'self' to blindfold our poor and lower-middle peasants and make us take the backward road. This is a foolish dream. We poor and lower-middle peasants will follow Chairman Mao and walk the socialist and communist road. We must wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly smash the spiritual shackles of 'three independences and one contract' and 'work points as the commander,' and liberate ourselves from the bourgeois 'self,' dedicating ourselves to revolutionary farming."

Several community members who participated in building the cattle shed denounced China's Khrushchev, the biggest troublemaker, at the meeting. Community member Tongju said, "Previously, due to being poisoned by the class enemy's 'work points as the commander,' when building the cattle shed, we only cared about earning more work points and did not pay attention to the quality at all, resulting in unnecessary losses to the collective cause. I must resolutely fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, and follow Chairman Mao to walk the socialist road with one heart."

Through the revolutionary big-character poster campaign, the poor and lower-middle peasants' awareness of the two-line struggle was greatly heightened. Everyone said: The previous cattle shed was built on the 'self' character, too fragile. Today, we must rebuild it, building it on the foundation of 'public.' Thus, all the poor and lower-middle peasants of the brigade got up early and worked late, carrying stones from the mountains to build a sturdy new cattle shed.

    现场批判会
    郭全有　董文廷　王旭东
    不久前的一个晚上，河北崇礼县东方红公社头道营大队第二生产队的牛棚，被一头公牛顶撞倒塌了。经过驻地解放军和大队贫下中农的迅速抢救，除了一头牛被压死以外，其余的牛都安全脱险。社员们望着倒塌的牛棚，瞅着死去的牛，当场就议论开了。有的说：“这牛棚盖的时间不长，现在倒了，应叫当初盖棚的人来承担责任。”有的社员不同意，说：“这牛棚是中国赫鲁晓夫大刮‘三自一包’、‘工分挂帅’黑风时盖的，是这个坏蛋的罪过！”
    帮助大队办学习班的解放军同志听了大伙的意见很受启发，心想：目前，大队正在开展革命的大批判，既然牛棚倒塌是“三自一包”黑风的恶果，就以牛棚倒塌为活教材，开展一场革命的大批判。
    第二生产队的革命群众在牛棚倒塌的地方开了一个控诉中国赫鲁晓夫罪行的大会。会议一开始，贫下中农就气愤地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫和他在本县的代理人大搞‘三自一包’，就是妄图用资产阶级的‘私’字，来蒙住我们贫下中农的眼睛，要我们走回头路。这是痴心妄想。我们贫下中农跟毛主席是跟定了，走社会主义共产主义道路是走定了！我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，彻底砸烂‘三自一包’、‘工分挂帅’这套修正主义精神枷锁，把自己从资产阶级‘私’字中解放出来，全心全意为革命种田。”
    当初参加盖牛棚的几个社员，在会上控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫这个最大的害人精。社员同居说：“以前由于中了阶级敌人‘工分挂帅’的毒，盖牛棚时只顾多赚工分，根本没有注意质量，结果给集体事业带来了不应有的损失。我一定要狠狠斗私批修，一个心眼紧跟毛主席走社会主义道路。”
    通过革命大批判，大大提高了贫下中农两条路线斗争的觉悟。大家说：过去的牛棚盖在“私”字上，太不坚固。今天我们一定要把它重新盖起来，盖在“公”字的根基上。于是，全队的贫下中农起早贪黑，从山上运来了石头，盖起了一座坚固的新牛棚。
