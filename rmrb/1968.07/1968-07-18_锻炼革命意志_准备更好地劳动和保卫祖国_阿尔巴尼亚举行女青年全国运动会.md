Albanian young women have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Albanian Labor Party, launching a campaign against religious superstition, changing customs, and thoroughly liberating women. They have actively participated in mass sports activities, strengthened their revolutionary willpower, and prepared to work and defend the motherland better.

From July 7 to 14, the Albanian National Women's Sports Festival was held in the capital, Tirana. Albanian party and government leaders, including Shehu, Balluku, and Çarçani, attended the opening ceremony.

Over 1,500 young women from all over the country participated in this festival. Before this, more than 35,000 female youth from factories, rural areas, and schools participated in local selection competitions. Many young women from remote mountainous areas such as Tropoja, Kukes, Mirdita, Gramsh, and Librazhd participated in a national-level competition for the first time. They actively engaged in various social and political activities, striving to temper themselves, continuously raising their ideological awareness, and expressing their gratitude to the party and government for their great care.

This festival was divided into first and second levels, with events including track and field, military obstacle races, shooting, radio communications, gymnastics, basketball, and volleyball. Over the course of eight days filled with friendship and intense competition, the athletes demonstrated their athletic talents, exchanged experiences, strengthened revolutionary friendships, and achieved good results.
