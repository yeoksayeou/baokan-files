Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam's Foreign Liaison Committee Issue Statements

Completely Support the Just Stance of the Royal Government of Cambodia

Strongly Condemn the New Crime of the U.S. Imperialists and the Saigon Puppet Clique's Airplanes Massacring the Cambodian People

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 9th: Local newspapers reported on the 8th that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 7th, strongly condemning the new crime of two U.S. imperialist and Saigon puppet regime aircraft invading the airspace of Cambodia's Banteay Meanchey Province on June 29th, strafing and killing and injuring 18 Cambodian civilians.

	The statement pointed out that the savage killings of the Cambodian people by U.S. imperialism and the Saigon puppet regime expose that U.S. imperialism and its Saigon lackeys have not abandoned their plot to invade the Kingdom of Cambodia. These evil acts expose the lies of the U.S. government's so-called "guarantees" of respecting Cambodia's sovereignty, neutrality, and territorial integrity.

	The statement expressed complete support for the just stance of the Royal Government of Cambodia in its two statements on July 2nd and 3rd, demanding that the United States and the Saigon puppet regime must immediately stop all their evil actions against the Kingdom of Cambodia and must respect Cambodia's independence, neutrality, and territorial integrity.

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 11th: According to the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam's Foreign Liaison Committee recently issued a statement, strongly condemning the new crimes committed by the United States and its Saigon lackeys against the Cambodian people.

	The statement pointed out that the crime of U.S. aircraft invading the airspace of Cambodia's Banteay Meanchey Province on June 29th and massacring local residents is not accidental. It is an important part of the U.S. plot to deliberately violate Cambodia's sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence, and neutrality.

	The statement expressed complete support for the statements issued by the Royal Government of Cambodia and called on world public opinion to resolutely oppose the U.S. policy of aggression against the Cambodian people and the peoples of other countries in Indochina.

    越南外交部和南方民族解放阵线对外联络委员会分别发表声明
    完全支持柬埔寨王国政府的正义立场
    强烈谴责美帝和西贡傀儡集团飞机屠杀柬埔寨人民的新罪行
    新华社河内九日电 此间报纸八日报道：越南民主共和国外交部七日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义和西贡伪政权的两架飞机六月二十九日侵入柬埔寨波萝勉省上空进行扫射，打死打伤十八名柬埔寨居民的新罪行。
    声明指出，美帝国主义和西贡傀儡集团野蛮杀害柬埔寨人民的罪恶行径表明，美帝国主义及其西贡走狗仍然不放弃对柬埔寨王国的侵略阴谋。这些罪恶行动揭穿了美国当局的所谓“尊重柬埔寨的主权、中立和领土完整”的“保证”完全是骗人的。
    声明表示完全支持柬埔寨王国政府在七月二日和三日的两项声明中所阐明的正义立场，要求美国和西贡傀儡政权必须立即停止对柬埔寨王国的一切罪恶行动，必须尊重柬埔寨的独立、中立和领土完整。
    新华社河内十一日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对外联络委员会最近发表声明，强烈谴责美国及其西贡走狗对柬埔寨人民犯下的新罪行。
    声明指出，六月二十九日美国飞机侵入柬埔寨波萝勉省上空，屠杀当地居民的罪行，决不是偶然的，这是美国蓄意侵犯柬埔寨的主权、领土完整、独立和中立的阴谋的一个重要部分。
    声明表示完全支持柬埔寨王国政府就此发表的声明，并且呼吁世界舆论坚决反对美国对柬埔寨人民和印度支那其他各国人民的侵略政策。
