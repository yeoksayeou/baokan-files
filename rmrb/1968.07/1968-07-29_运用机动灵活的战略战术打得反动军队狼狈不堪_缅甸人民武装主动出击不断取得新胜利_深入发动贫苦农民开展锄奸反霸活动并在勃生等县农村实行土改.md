The Burmese people's armed forces, led by the Burmese Communist Party, and the armed forces of various nationalities in Burma, have recently launched a series of proactive attacks in various parts of Burma, achieving new victories.

According to reports from reactionary newspapers in Burma, in the Lower Burma regions and some areas of Upper Burma, the armed forces of various ethnic groups in Burma are highly active. They have adopted flexible and mobile tactics, defeating the reactionary army of Burma in a disorganized manner. On the morning of June 2, the Burmese people's armed forces surrounded and attacked the police station in Lanyibin Town, Bago District, burning down a warehouse of the Burmese reactionary government. At the same time, another group of people's armed forces coordinated this battle by attacking a nearby area. The Burmese people's armed forces, in these two battles, fought off the reactionary army's Sixth Infantry Battalion and Fifty-Seventh Infantry Battalion, among other large units, and successfully retreated after completing their missions. On the night of June 7, armed personnel of the National Democratic Front of Burma, in collaboration with those who had previously entered Maunggale Town in the Irrawaddy region, attacked this town and seized a large amount of supplies from three "People's Stores" of the Burmese reactionary government. On June 26, the Karen people's armed forces of the National Democratic Front of Burma ambushed a battalion of the reactionary army's Twenty-Fifth Infantry Battalion on the public road in the Gikamai Township of the Danai Salin region, killing the deputy commander and two others. On July 5, the Burmese people's armed forces fought a twelve-hour battle with a camp of the reactionary government's army between Maungdaw and Maunggale Towns in the Irrawaddy region, killing one commander and two deputy commanders, and wounding ten soldiers.

The Burmese people's armed forces have also consecutively attacked the water and land transportation lines heavily guarded by the Burmese reactionary government, achieving significant results. On June 5, the Burmese people's armed forces blew up a train escorted by armored vehicles from Yangon to Mandalay in Bago District, killing a battalion commander and fourteen others. Immediately after, the people's armed forces attacked a company of reactionary troops stationed nearby at the Payae station, causing the enemy to suffer two blows and unable to support each other. On the same morning, the armed forces of the National Democratic Front of Burma ambushed a convoy of cars on the public road in the Bhamo District, killing two armed policemen and seizing a batch of weapons. On the night of June 21, the Burmese people's armed forces blew up an armored vehicle on the Yangon-Mandalay railway in the Yaw Township with a landmine, killing a deputy commander, injuring a commander and some soldiers, and seizing three machine guns, two rifles, and a batch of ammunition. On June 28, the Burmese people's armed forces attacked a ship escorted by two armed motorboats of the reactionary army from Bago to Yangon. On July 4, the Burmese people's armed forces intercepted two motor-sailboats of the reactionary government in the coastal area of Thawa Township, seizing a large amount of materials from the Burmese reactionary government's trade bureau.

The Burmese reactionary government is extremely terrified by the frequent attacks of the people's armed forces on the water and land transportation lines. The reactionary authorities in the surrounding areas of Yangon, such as Bago, Bhamo, Thayetmyo, and Yaw, announced in late June and early July the implementation of curfews from 6 PM to 6 AM along the railway lines.

While widely conducting guerrilla warfare to strike the enemy, the Burmese people's armed forces have mobilized impoverished farmers to carry out anti-spy and anti-tyrant activities in various places and have implemented land reform in the rural areas of Bago and Bago. In the Thawa Township of the Danai Salin region, under the impact of the farmers' revolutionary surge, 80 of the 139 so-called "village agricultural cooperatives" established by the Burmese reactionary government to plunder and exploit farmers have already collapsed.

    深入发动贫苦农民开展锄奸反霸活动并在勃生等县农村实行土改
    据新华社二十六日讯　仰光消息：缅甸共产党领导的人民武装和缅甸各民族人民武装，最近在缅甸各地接连主动出击，取得了新胜利。
    据缅甸反动报纸透露，在下缅甸的各个地区和上缅甸的一些地区，缅甸各族人民武装极为活跃，他们采用了机动灵活的战术，打得缅甸反动军队狼狈不堪。六月二日清晨，缅甸人民武装包围袭击了勃固县良礼彬镇的警察哨所，烧毁了缅甸反动政府的一座仓库。同时，另一批人民武装配合这次战斗，袭击了这个镇附近的一个地区。缅甸人民武装在这两次战斗中，打得前来镇压的缅甸反动军队第六步兵营和第五十七步兵营等大批部队无法招架。他们在完成任务后安全撤退。六月七日深夜，缅甸民族民主团结阵线的武装人员，同事先进入伊洛瓦底地区毛礼镇的武装人员里应外合，袭击了这个镇，从缅甸反动政府的三家“人民商店”中缴获了大批物资。六月二十六日，民族民主团结阵线的克伦族人民武装在丹那沙林地区吉坎湄县的公路上，袭击了缅甸反动军队第二十五步兵营的一个大队，打死了这支军队的副队长等三人。七月五日，缅甸人民武装在伊洛瓦底地区的毛淡棉遵镇和毛礼镇之间，同缅甸反动政府军队的一个营激战十二个小时，打死反动军队队长一人、副队长二人，打死打伤士兵十人。
    缅甸人民武装还接连袭击缅甸反动政府重兵保护下的水陆交通线，取得重大战果。六月五日，缅甸人民武装在勃固县炸毁了由装甲车护送的从仰光开往曼德勒的一列火车，炸死了护送这列火车的一名大队长等十四人。紧接着，人民武装又向驻守在附近的帕耶支站的反动军队一个连发动进攻，使敌人两处挨打，无法互相支援。同一天早晨，缅甸民族民主团结阵线武装在卑谬县的公路上伏击一列汽车，打死两名武装警察，缴获了一批武器。六月二十一日晚，缅甸人民武装在东吁县境内仰光—曼德勒铁路上用地雷炸毁一辆护路装甲车，炸死反动军队的副队长一人，炸伤队长一人和一些士兵，缴获了三挺机枪、两支步枪和一批弹药。六月二十八日，缅甸人民武装袭击了缅甸反动军队的两艘武装汽艇护航的一艘从勃生开往仰光的轮船。七月四日，缅甸人民武装在土瓦县沿海截获了反动政府的两艘机帆船，缴获了缅甸反动政府贸易局的大量物资。
    缅甸反动政府对人民武装在水陆交通线上的频繁袭击，感到十分惊恐。仰光周围的勃固、卑谬、沙耶瓦底、东吁等县的反动当局，在六月底和七月初纷纷宣布在每晚六时到次晨六时，在铁路沿线实行戒严。
    缅甸人民武装在广泛开展游击战打击敌人的同时，深入发动贫苦农民在各地开展锄奸反霸活动，并且在勃生、勃固等县的农村实行土地改革。在丹那沙林地区的土瓦县，在农民革命怒潮的冲击下，缅甸反动政府设立的专门掠夺和剥削农民的一百三十九个所谓“乡村农业合作社”，已经有八十多个宣告垮台。
