Red Guard member Cai Lijian, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on intellectuals integrating with the masses of workers and peasants, bravely faces hardships and goes to the mountains to settle down, determined to be a farmer for life. This highly conscious revolutionary action is extremely valuable. The revolutionary spirit of "the harder the place, the more we should go" should be greatly promoted. From Cai Lijian's actions, we can see how greatly the spiritual face of the broad masses of young intellectuals has changed after being tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out long ago in his brilliant work "The Orientation of the Youth Movement": "How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary? What standard do we use? What do we use to distinguish them? There is only one standard, that is, whether they are willing to and actually integrate with the broad masses of workers and peasants."

Intellectual youth going to the countryside, to the border regions, to factories, to the grassroots, and integrating with the masses of workers and peasants is a need for socialist revolution and socialist construction, an important measure to prevent and combat revisionism, and an important way to cultivate successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution.

Intellectual youth becoming farmers, workers, is a great social revolution. From ancient times, landlords, the bourgeoisie, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party like Khrushchev, have all advocated the exploitative class ideology of "those who labor with their minds rule over others," studying to become officials, achieving fame and fortune, etc. Today, the proletarian revolutionary faction and Red Guards who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao will thoroughly eliminate this several-thousand-year-old old ideology. Intellectual youth becoming farmers, workers, have a great future!

The question of how to cultivate the younger generation has always been a fierce struggle between two classes, two lines, and two ideologies. Therefore, whether intellectual youth are willing to and actually integrate with the masses of workers and peasants is a touchstone for loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Graduates of universities and middle schools should firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party like Khrushchev, fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, and bravely break with all kinds of old ideologies of the exploiting classes. Many intellectual youth have set examples for us, and the broad masses of intellectual youth as well as their parents should all learn from and be inspired by their model deeds.

"Rural areas are a vast world where one can achieve great things." Five hundred million peasants urgently need and warmly welcome a large number of intellectual youth to go there and build a new socialist countryside together with them. The countryside needs intellectual youth, and intellectual youth should happily go to the countryside, integrate with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and grow through the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment!

    越是困难的地方越是要去
    向阳红
    红卫兵小将蔡立坚，遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于知识分子要和工农群众相结合的教导，不怕艰苦，到山区落户，立志当一辈子农民。这种高度自觉的革命行动是十分可贵的。这种“越是困难的地方越是要去”的革命精神值得大大发扬。从蔡立坚的行动中，可以看到，经过无产阶级文化大革命的洗炼，广大知识青年的精神面貌，发生了多么巨大的变化啊！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席早在《青年运动的方向》这篇光辉著作中，就深刻地指出：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”
    知识青年到农村去，到边疆去，到工矿去，到基层去，和工农群众结合在一起，是社会主义革命和社会主义建设的需要，是防修、反修的重要措施，也是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的重要途径。
    知识青年当农民，当工人，是一场社会大革命。自古以来，地主、资产阶级、中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派，都是宣扬“劳心者治人”，读书做官，成名成家等剥削阶级的思想。今天，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将，要把这个几千年的旧思想彻底清除。知识青年当农民，当工人，大有作为！
    怎样培养年青的一代，历来存在着激烈的两个阶级、两条路线、两种思想的斗争。因此，知识青年愿意不愿意、实行不实行和工农群众相结合，这是忠不忠于毛主席、忠不忠于毛泽东思想、忠不忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的试金石。
    大、中学校的毕业生，应该坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线上，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义路线，斗私批修，勇敢地和形形色色的剥削阶级旧思想作最彻底的决裂。许许多多知识青年，为我们做出了榜样，广大知识青年以及他们的家长，都应该从他们的模范事迹中受到教育和鼓舞。
      “农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”五亿农民迫切需要、热烈欢迎大批知识青年到那里去，和他们一起建设社会主义的新农村。农村需要知识青年，知识青年应该高兴地到农村去，和广大贫下中农结合在一块，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中锻炼成长！
