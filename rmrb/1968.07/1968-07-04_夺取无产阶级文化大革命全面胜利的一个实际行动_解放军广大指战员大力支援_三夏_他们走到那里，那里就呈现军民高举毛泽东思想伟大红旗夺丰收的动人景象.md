"See the golden waves of rice and millet, heroes everywhere at dusk." Amidst the frequent reports of bumper harvests of summer crops across the country, the broad ranks of the People's Liberation Army have rushed to the front lines of agricultural production with a fighting posture, supporting the summer harvest, summer planting, and summer management work in rural people's communes across the country. The broad ranks of soldiers and officers regard supporting the "three summers" in rural areas as a practical action to support the rural areas in achieving a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They regard the "three summers" front as a place to learn and propagate the great thoughts of Mao Zedong. Wherever they go, a moving scene of soldiers and civilians holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and striving for a bumper harvest is presented.

Since the beginning of summer, teams composed of officers and soldiers from the troops have been in the vast rural areas, working side by side with the commune members to harvest, transplant, and weed. The ironworking and carpentry teams sent by the troops have set up red furnaces at the village edges and field heads, with roaring flames and clanging hammers, repairing agricultural tools for the commune members and the troops supporting the "three summers." The medical personnel of the troops, with medicine boxes slung over their shoulders, move through the fields and threshing grounds, treating the commune members' illnesses and injuries. Many troops' performance teams, broadcasting teams, and lantern slide teams are active in the fields, enthusiastically propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and the brilliant deeds of heroes like Lei Feng. At the same time, they collect the good deeds of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in seizing the revolution and promoting production, compile them into programs, and write them into articles for timely dissemination. Many troops that have been supporting agriculture since spring have also fully invested in the "three summers" work, determined to contribute greater efforts to the rural areas to achieve dual victories in revolution and production.

The soldiers and officers of various troops regard supporting the rural "three summers" work as an integral part of following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Before the summer harvest season arrived, the party committees of various regional troops and various military branches issued instructions to their subordinate troops, requiring them to complete the task of supporting rural "three summers" as a major political task. Many troops, to better support the "three summers," also summarized and introduced the experiences of supporting spring farming. The troops stationed in Beijing's Shunyi and Jiangsu's Huaiyin, to do a good job in supporting the "three summers," sent people to production teams in advance to investigate the situation and understand the demands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers unanimously believe that supporting the "three summers" is to support the rural areas in achieving a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and to defend the battle achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Thousands of supports, tens of thousands of supports, the greatest and best support is to arm the broad masses with Mao Zedong Thought. The leaders of a certain unit of the Nanjing troops, who were warmly received by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin on June 3, led the soldiers and officers supporting the "three summers" to the countryside and immediately reported the great news of Chairman Mao's extremely good health to the poor and lower-middle peasants, greatly encouraging the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. More than 200 members of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams sent by a certain unit of the Air Force, together with the commune members, carried out the "three loyalties" activity of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They studied with the broad masses of commune members Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, and policies on continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, discussed the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and sang the praises of the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Many troops also, according to the commune members' active thoughts in the "three summers," held Mao Zedong Thought study classes by the fields, propagating Chairman Mao's great policies of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" and "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," educating the masses to do a good job in summer harvesting, summer planting, and summer management. Some troops also studied with the commune members Chairman Mao's teachings on thrift, emphasizing that during the busy summer harvest season, they should both harvest and thresh quickly and carefully, ensuring that every grain is collected. The soldiers and officers supporting the "three summers" in various troops also, together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, set up revolutionary criticism battlefields in the fields, launching a fierce attack on the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of material incentives advocated by China's Khrushchev and his agents. They also, in response to the revisionist fallacies of a small handful of capitalist roaders within the party, such as China's Khrushchev, in grain procurement work, organized the commune members to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "in the distribution problem, we must consider the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual," correctly handling the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, ensuring that this year's summer grain procurement task was completed quickly and well.

The soldiers and officers supporting the "three summers" in various troops, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," actively helped the poor and lower-middle peasants to grasp class struggle during the busy season and launch a fierce attack on class enemies. Many officers and soldiers, upon arriving in the countryside, immediately studied with the revolutionary masses the new situations, new trends, and new problems in class struggle, using living class struggle facts to sharpen the eyes of the broad revolutionary masses and raise their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. The troops supporting the "three summers" on Hainan Island, together with the local Li and Miao peoples, fiercely exposed and struggled against the class enemies who plotted to sabotage the summer harvest and summer planting. The troops supporting the "three summers" in Handan, Hebei, mobilized the masses to smash a small handful of class enemies who incited clan disputes, stirred up a counter-revolutionary economic wind, and plotted to sabotage the summer harvest. The troops in the countryside also, together with the local militias, ensured the smooth progress of the summer harvest and summer planting.

Various regional troops regard supporting the "three summers" as a great opportunity to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants and to closely connect with the masses. Many officers and soldiers, through visiting the poor and asking about their hardships, recalled bitterness and sweetness with the poor and lower-middle peasants, further understanding Chairman Mao's teachings on "the main force that has been fighting and struggling in the countryside is the poor peasants," and that the poor peasants are "the most revolutionary" and "listen to the leadership of the Communist Party the most." They received extremely profound education in laboring, studying, and living with the poor and lower-middle peasants.

    夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一个实际行动
    解放军广大指战员大力支援“三夏”
    他们走到那里，那里就呈现军民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗夺丰收的动人景象
    新华社三日讯　“喜看稻菽千重浪，遍地英雄下夕烟。”在全国各地夏收作物丰收捷报频传声中，人民解放军广大指战员，以战斗的姿态，奔赴农业生产第一线，支援各地农村人民公社的夏收、夏种、夏管工作。广大指战员把到农村支援“三夏”，作为支援广大农村夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一个实际行动，把“三夏”第一线作为学习和宣传伟大的毛泽东思想的场所。他们走到那里，那里就呈现一派军民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，奋战夺丰收的动人景象。
    入夏以来，一队队由部队干部战士组成的支援“三夏”毛泽东思想宣传队，就在广阔的农村里和广大社员并肩收割、插秧、锄草。部队派出的铁工组和木工组，把红炉架在村边、地头，炉火熊熊，锤声当当，为社员和支援“三夏”的部队修理农具。部队的医疗人员，挎着药箱，穿行在田间和场上，为社员看病医伤。许多部队的演唱组、广播组、幻灯组活跃在田间，热情宣传毛主席的最新指示，宣传门合等英雄人物的光辉事迹，同时搜集广大贫下中农和革命干部抓革命、促生产的好人好事，编成节目、写成稿件，及时加以传播。许多从春天起就在农业生产第一线支农的部队，又全力投入“三夏”工作，决心为广大农村夺取革命、生产双胜利贡献更大力量。
    各部队指战员都把支援农村“三夏”工作，作为紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署、落实毛主席最新指示的一个组成部分。在夏收大忙季节到来之前，各地区部队和各军种兵种党委，都向所属部队发出指示，要求把支援农村“三夏”当作一项重大政治任务来完成。许多部队为了更有成效地支援“三夏”，还总结和介绍了支援春耕生产的经验。驻北京顺义部队和驻江苏淮阴部队，为了做好支援“三夏”工作，事先派人到生产队调查情况，了解贫下中农的要求。广大干部战士一致认为：支援“三夏”，就是支援农村夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，就是保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，保卫无产阶级文化大革命的战斗成果。
    千支援，万支援，用毛泽东思想武装广大群众，是最大、最好的支援。曾在六月三日受到毛主席和林副主席亲切接见的南京部队某部领导干部，带领支援“三夏”的指战员一到农村，就向贫下中农报告毛主席身体非常非常健康的特大喜讯，使广大贫下中农受到极大鼓舞。空军某部派出的二百多个支援“三夏”的毛泽东思想宣传队，同社员一起开展了无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动，和广大社员一起学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，一起畅谈无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果，歌颂毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。许多部队还针对社员在“三夏”中的活思想，在田边举办毛泽东思想学习班，宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”和“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大方针，教育群众切实搞好夏收、夏种、夏管工作。有的部队还和社员一起学习了毛主席有关勤俭节约的教导，强调在夏收大忙中，既要快打快收，又要精打细收，保证做到颗粒归仓。各部队支援“三夏”的指战员，还和广大贫下中农一起在田头大摆革命大批判的战场，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义路线。还针对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派在粮食征购工作中的修正主义谬论，组织社员学习毛主席“在分配问题上，我们必须兼顾国家利益、集体利益和个人利益”的教导，正确处理了国家、集体、个人三者的关系，使今年的夏粮征购任务完成得又快又好。
    各部队支援“三夏”的指战员，遵循毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，积极帮助贫下中农在大忙季节狠抓阶级斗争，向阶级敌人展开猛烈进攻。许多干部战士一到农村，立即和革命群众一起研究阶级斗争的新情况、新动向、新问题，用活生生的阶级斗争事实，擦亮广大革命群众的眼睛，提高他们的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。海南岛支援“三夏”的某部队，同当地黎族、苗族人民一起，狠狠揭露和斗争了阴谋破坏夏收、夏种的阶级敌人。河北邯郸支援“三夏”的某部队，发动群众，粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人煽动宗族纠纷，大刮反革命经济主义妖风，破坏夏收的阴谋。各部队在农村，还同当地民兵一起，保卫了夏收、夏种的顺利进行。
    各地区部队把支援“三夏”，作为向贫下中农学习、密切联系群众的大好机会。许多干部战士经过访贫问苦，和贫下中农一起忆苦思甜，进一步领会了毛主席关于“乡村中一向苦战奋斗的主要力量是贫农”，以及贫农“最革命”、“最听共产党的领导”等教导。他们在同贫下中农同劳动、同学习中，受到了极为深刻的教育。
