The People's Liberation Army soldiers stationed in the former Long March route of the Red Army in the Aba and Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures of northwestern Sichuan have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have performed new meritorious deeds for the Tibetan, Qiang, and other ethnic minorities. To do a good job of "three supports, two militaries," they carry Chairman Mao's revolutionary books on their backs, fearlessly traversing high mountains and rugged roads, and enduring harsh winds and snows. They go wherever they are sent, spreading Mao Zedong Thought there, making it take root, blossom, and bear fruit.

	Grassland Military-Civilian Study Classes

	In May of this year, Deputy Political Instructor Wang Shujun of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture led more than thirty soldiers to trek through mountains and rivers to Baixi District in Ruoergai County. There, they jointly established the first Mao Zedong Thought study class with the local Tibetan people.

	Baixi District is home to only about fifty Tibetan families. However, it is the place where Chairman Mao led the Red Army to hold the famous Baixi Conference against Zhang Guotao's right-opportunist line during the Long March. Today, the People's Liberation Army, personally founded by the great leader Chairman Mao, has sent a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team carrying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have followed in the footsteps of the Red Army of yesteryears, coming here to review the glorious traditions and history of the Party's line struggle with the Tibetan people, and to jointly achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The study class invited old Red Army veterans who followed Chairman Mao during the Long March to share stories of Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practices during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, as well as many touching stories of the Red Army's love for the people and the people's support for the army. They also visited the house where Chairman Mao stayed and the slogans carved on the rock walls by the Red Army, receiving a profound education in the Party's traditions. With hearts full of excitement, they swore to our great leader Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao, we will definitely follow your teachings and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!"

	At night, soldiers and Tibetan revolutionary masses gathered at the study class to jointly study Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle and line struggle, as well as his latest instructions, raising their awareness of the two-line struggle. They said, "China's Khrushchev opposes Chairman Mao; he will definitely meet the same fate as Zhang Guotao!"

	Now, on the snow-capped grasslands of Ruoergai County, the People's Liberation Army is helping the Tibetan people establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes everywhere. Incomplete statistics show that the county has held more than eighty such classes, with over three thousand Tibetan people studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The revolutionary song "The party's kindness is greater than the heavens and the earth, parents' love is not as dear as Chairman Mao's" echoes across the northwestern Sichuan grasslands.

	High-Altitude Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams

	Jiang Mucan, deputy platoon leader of the Ninth Platoon of a certain unit stationed in the Ruoergai grasslands of northwestern Sichuan, led a team of more than ten people to carry Chairman Mao's latest instructions to every village and hamlet. They braved the wind and snow, marching towards the high-altitude region of Zhanwa Township at over 3,800 meters. Along the 200-plus kilometer march, the soldiers propagated Mao Zedong Thought as they walked. When hungry, they ate tsampa; when thirsty, they drank melted snow. Wherever they went, they brought Mao Zedong Thought with them. On the second day of the march, the intense sunlight and vast snowfields caused many soldiers to develop snow blindness, their eyes swelling like walnuts, unable to see anything. The soldiers recited Chairman Mao's quotations, using his instructions to encourage themselves to continue forward. They declared, "We will be like eagles on the mountains, our wings unbroken by storms; we will be like steeds on the grasslands, our progress unstopped by hardships."

	Zhanwa Township is located at the junction of Sichuan, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces. The area is sparsely populated, and class struggle is sharp and complex. Deputy Platoon Leader Jiang Mucan and the soldiers, upon arrival, went deep into the homes of poor and lower-middle-class peasants, eating, living, and working with them. They propagated the great Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and together with the poor and lower-middle-class peasants, exposed and criticized China's Khrushchev's advocacy of "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," and his attempt to restore capitalism. An old man named Luo Ke said to the platoon leader Ren Zhen, who was staying at his house, "You can't eat our bitter buckwheat." Ren Zhen replied, "We are the people's soldiers, we grew up eating bitter buckwheat." Saying this, he took a handful of bitter buckwheat and put it in his mouth. Old Man Luo Ke, moved, gave a thumbs up and praised, "The golden soldiers (People's Liberation Army) are truly good!"

	Under the mobilization of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, the poor and lower-middle-class peasants of Zhanwa Township united and launched a fierce attack on class enemies. At the big criticism meetings, impoverished herdsmen, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, used their own bitter history and personal experiences to powerfully criticize China's Khrushchev's advocacy of "exploitation is meritorious" and the implementation of "three freedoms and one contract." Old Man Luo Ke said, "In the dark old society, I was sold by the serf owners three times. It was Chairman Mao who saved me from hell. A handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, their hearts are blacker than crows, more vicious than wolves, more poisonous than snakes, and they want us to go back on our path. That is a thousand times impossible, ten thousand times impossible."

	The red sun illuminated the deep valleys, and the golden soldiers (People's Liberation Army) brought timely rain. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, Zhanwa Township has undergone great changes. Now, the revolutionary masses of this township are establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, studying the "Old Three Articles," and many community members get up before dawn to collect manure, voluntarily pouring fertilizer into collective fields. People's spirits and attire have changed. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shines on the grasslands, and the revolution and production in Zhanwa Township present a scene of vigorous activity.

	Platoon Leader Re Duo and the Red Guards

	Re Duo, a platoon leader of the Sixth Platoon of a certain unit stationed in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, returned from a propaganda mission to Ge'ka Mountain, fifty miles away from the garrison, and suddenly encountered a blizzard. On the snow-covered mountain road, the youngest Red Guard, only nine years old, and the oldest, in their teens, held hands and struggled forward under the leadership of Platoon Leader Re Duo. The snow fell heavier, and the road became more difficult to traverse. With each step forward, they had to exert great effort. Platoon Leader Re Duo carried the backpacks and satchels of five Red Guards on his back. After walking a while, the two youngest Red Guards could no longer walk, and Re Duo was also exhausted. What to do? Stopping in the blizzard was very dangerous. At this moment, Re Duo thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, "Carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." He thought, as long as he had a breath, he would protect the Red Guard youths and safely bring them down the mountain. Thus, he gritted his teeth, carried the two youngest Red Guards on his shoulders, and after more than an hour of arduous journey, finally brought the Red Guard youths down the mountain.

	During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Re Duo and the Red Guard youths forged a deep bond of revolutionary friendship. He had more than once selflessly rescued Red Guard youths in danger. In his interactions with the youths, he always followed the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army to cultivate the Red Guards. He often studied Chairman Mao's works with the Red Guard youths, told them stories of Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Liu Yingjun, and explained the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army, always paying attention to cultivating in the youths the spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people and a meticulous work style.

	Once, he and the youths went to a mountain area dozens of miles away to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They set out early in the morning, and upon arrival, without eating or drinking, immediately organized a performance and went door-to-door to propagate. By the time it was dark, only one household remained unpropagated. Just then, a truck passing by offered them a ride back to the garrison. Some youths suggested taking the ride back. Should they take the ride back or continue propagating and walk back? Re Duo believed that propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions should not leave any gaps, and not propagating even one household showed a lack of the spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. Thus, he did ideological work with the youths, letting the younger ones take the ride home and leaving a few older ones with himself to continue propagating. After finishing the work, it was already deep into the night. Although Re Duo and the youths were very tired, they were still in high spirits as they walked back to the garrison.

	Under Re Duo's guidance, these Red Guard youths are growing healthily. Community members affectionately praised these youths as: "Eagles of the Kangba Plateau, Chairman Mao's red little pioneers."

    川西北高原上的爱民新歌
    驻守在当年红军长征路上的川西北阿坝、甘孜两个藏族自治州的人民解放军指战员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，为藏、羌等兄弟民族人民，立下了新功。为了做好“三支”“两军”工作，他们身背毛主席的革命宝书，不怕山高路险，不畏风雪严寒，长年奔走在茫茫的雪山草地。他们走到那里，就把毛泽东思想传播到那里，就让伟大的毛泽东思想在那里生根、开花、结果。
        草原上的军民学习班
    今年五月间，驻守在阿坝藏族自治州的人民解放军某部副教导员王述均，带领三十多个战士，跋山涉水，来到若尔盖县巴西区，和当地藏族人民联合办起了第一个毛泽东思想学习班。
    巴西区仅仅居住着五十多户藏族人家。但是这里却是毛主席当年领导红军长征途中，在川西北召开反对张国焘右倾机会主义路线的著名的巴西会议的地方。今天，由伟大统帅毛主席亲手缔造的中国人民解放军又派出毛泽东思想宣传队，带着毛主席的最新指示，踏着当年红军的足迹，来到这里，和藏族人民重温党的光荣传统和路线斗争的历史，一道夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    学习班邀请了当年跟随毛主席长征的老红军，讲述毛主席在第二次国内革命战争时期的伟大革命实践，以及红军在长征途中军爱民、民拥军的许多动人故事。他们又一起参观了毛主席居住过的一间屋子，以及红军刻写在石壁上的标语口号，受到了一次极为深刻的党的传统教育。他们怀着激动的心情，向我们伟大的领袖毛主席宣誓：毛主席呀，毛主席！我们一定遵照您老人家的教导，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    一到夜晚，战士和藏族革命群众一起来到学习班，共同学习毛主席关于阶级斗争、路线斗争的教导，以及毛主席一系列最新指示，提高自己的两条路线斗争觉悟。他们说，中国赫鲁晓夫反对毛主席，他一定和张国焘一样，没有好下场！
    现在，在若尔盖县的雪山草地上，人民解放军帮助藏族人民到处开办了毛泽东思想学习班。据不完全统计，全县举办的学习班已达八十多期，有三千多藏族人民学习了毛主席的最新指示。“天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲”的革命歌声，响彻了川西北草原。
      高寒山区的毛泽东思想宣传队
    川西北草地若尔盖驻军某部九连副连长江木参
  （藏族），为了把毛主席的最新指示落实到村村寨寨，带领一支十多人的毛泽东思想宣传队，冒着风雪，向海拔三千八百多米的大山区占洼乡进发。在二百多里的行军路上，战士们边行军，边宣传，饿了吃糌粑，渴了吞冰雪，走到那里，就把毛泽东思想带到那里。行军的第二天，强烈的阳光和遍野的白雪，使不少战士得了雪盲症，一个个眼睛肿得象核桃，什么也看不见。战士们背诵着毛主席的语录，用毛主席的指示激励着自己继续前进。他们豪迈地说：“我们要象高山上的雄鹰，风暴折不断翅膀；我们要象草原上的骏马，艰险阻止不住前进。”
    占洼乡位于四川、甘肃、青海三省的交界处。这里人烟稀少，阶级斗争十分尖锐、复杂。副连长江木参和战士们一到这里，就深入到贫下中农家里，与群众同吃同住同劳动，向贫下中农宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，和贫下中农一道，共同揭发、批判中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“三自一包”、
  “四大自由”等黑货和妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。一位名叫洛可的老大爷，对住在他家里的排长仁真说：“我们家的苦荞你吃不来。”仁真回答说：“我们是人民的子弟兵，都是吃苦荞长大的。”说着，就抓了几把苦荞放在嘴里。洛可大爷激动地竖起大拇指，连声称赞：“金珠玛米（解放军）真好！”
    在毛泽东思想宣传队的发动下，占洼乡的贫下中农团结起来，向阶级敌人展开了猛烈进攻。在大批判会上，贫苦牧民以毛泽东思想为武器，用自己悲惨的血泪史和亲身经历，有力地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“剥削有功”、推行“三自一包”的罪行。洛可大爷说：“在黑暗的旧社会，我曾经被农奴主卖过三次。是毛主席他老人家把我从地狱中救出来的。党内一小撮走资派，他们的心比乌鸦还黑，比豺狼还狠，比毒蛇还毒，妄想让我们走回头路，那是一千个办不到，一万个办不到。”
    红太阳照亮了深山沟，金珠玛米（解放军）送来了“及时雨”，在毛主席最新指示的指引下，占洼乡发生了很大的变化。现在，这个乡的革命群众大办毛泽东思想学习班，大学“老三篇”，不少社员天不亮就起来拾粪，自动地把肥料倒在集体的地里。人换精神地换装。毛泽东思想的光辉照到草地，占洼乡的革命、生产，都呈现出一派热火朝天的景象。
      排长热多和红卫兵小将
    甘孜藏族自治州驻军某部六连排长热多，和十二名红卫兵小将到离驻地五十里外的葛卡山宣传回来，突然遇到暴风雪。在风雪弥漫的山道上，年岁最大只有十几岁，最小才九岁的红卫兵小将，在排长热多的带领之下，手挽手，艰难地行进。雪越下越大，路越来越难走，每前进一步都要付出很大的气力。排长热多把五个红卫兵的背包和挎包一起背在自己身上。又走了一段路，有两个最小的红卫兵已经走不动了，排长热多也累得精疲力尽。怎么办？在暴风雪中停留，是十分危险的。这时，热多想起了毛主席“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风”的教导，他想，只要自己还有一口气，就要保护红卫兵小将安全下山。于是，他咬紧牙关，把两个最小的红卫兵背在两肩上，经过一个多小时的艰难行程，终于把红卫兵小将带下山来。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，热多和红卫兵小将，结下了深厚的战斗友谊。他曾经不止一次舍身忘我地抢救遇险的红卫兵小将。在和小将们相处的日子里，他始终按照解放军的优良传统培养红卫兵。他经常和红卫兵小将一起学习毛主席著作，向小将们讲雷锋、王杰、刘英俊的故事，讲解放军的光荣传统，处处注意在小将们的身上培养“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的精神，和一丝不苟的工作作风。
    有一次，他和小将到几十里外的山区宣传毛主席的最新指示，清早出发，到那里顾不上吃饭喝水，立即组织演出，挨门逐户宣传。到天黑时，只剩下最后一户没有宣传了，就在这时，恰好有辆开往驻地的汽车路过这里，有的小将就提出搭车回去。究竟是搭车回去，还是宣传完最后一户步行回去呢？热多认为，宣传毛主席的最新指示，不应当有空白点，一户没宣传到，就是缺乏“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的精神。于是，他向小将们作了思想工作，让年岁小的搭车回家，留下几个年岁大的和自己一起，继续宣传。工作结束后，夜已深了。热多和小将们虽然很累，他们仍然兴高采烈地徒步走回驻地。
    在热多帮助下，这些红卫兵小将正在健康的成长。社员们亲切地称赞这些小将是：“康藏高原上的雄鹰，毛主席的红色小闯将”。
