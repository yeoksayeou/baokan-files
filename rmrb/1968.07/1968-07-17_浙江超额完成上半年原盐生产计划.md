Revolutionary workers on the salt production front in Zhejiang Province, along with the people's commune members in the salt-producing areas, have, with the strong support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army, resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." The province's first half-year raw salt production plan has been exceeded in late June, with production increasing by 13 percent compared to the same period last year.

Since the beginning of this year, revolutionary workers and people's commune members in Zhejiang's salt-producing areas have firmly remembered Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle." They have launched a fierce criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods promoted by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the salt areas, such as the "three independences and one contract." Through the great criticism of the revolution, the broad masses of salt workers and poor and lower-middle peasants in the salt areas have grasped the revolution and vigorously promoted production, achieving remarkable results.

    浙江超额完成上半年原盐生产计划
    浙江省盐业生产战线上的广大革命职工和产盐区人民公社社员，在人民解放军的大力支持和帮助下，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，全省上半年的原盐生产计划已经在六月下旬超额完成，产量比去年同期增长了百分之十三。
    今年以来，浙江产盐区广大革命职工和人民公社社员，牢记毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在盐区推行的“三自一包”等反革命修正主义黑货。通过革命的大批判，广大盐工和盐区贫下中农社员狠抓革命，猛促生产，取得了显著成绩。
