“Yankee Go Home!” “Johnson Get Out!”
Salvadoran Students Drive Out the Plague
Johnson Trembles in Fear, in a Pitiable State

New China News Agency, July 7th: San Salvador News: When the head of American imperialism, Johnson, arrived in this city on the 6th to carry out his evil activities, Salvadoran students in the capital, despite the strict security measures of the local reactionary military police and American spies, angrily threw bottles filled with paint, as well as eggs and tomatoes, at Johnson's car, making this head of American imperialism tremble in fear and appear in a pitiable state.

Johnson's visit to El Salvador was to attend the “Central American Presidential Conference” that he himself had orchestrated. American imperialism aims to use this conference to address the crisis faced by its colonial plan of “Central American Economic Integration” to further control and enslave Central America.

On the 6th, hundreds of Salvadoran students once again held an anti-American demonstration in the capital, distributing leaflets condemning Johnson, and angrily tearing down American flags and welcoming banners for Johnson that the authorities had set up around the airport. Despite the obstruction of the reactionary military police, they also rushed to a high ground along the route from the airport to the city. When Johnson's convoy passed by, they threw bottles of paint, as well as eggs and tomatoes, from under a banner reading “Johnson is a murderer.” Some eggs hit Johnson's car, splattering the windows next to him; some eggs and paint bottles also hit the cars following behind Johnson.

On the eve of Johnson's arrival, Salvadoran students had held a fierce protest demonstration in the city, shouting slogans such as “Yankee Go Home!” “Johnson Get Out!” They tore down the welcoming banners for the American imperialist head Johnson and pasted up anti-American and condemning Johnson banners. The protesting students also rushed to the front of the American embassy and burned an effigy symbolizing American imperialists, protesting against the exploitation and plundering of the American imperialists against the people of Central America.

According to the New China News Agency, July 6th: San Salvador News: More than 2,000 university students in El Salvador held a massive demonstration march in the capital, San Salvador, on the evening of the 5th, angrily protesting against the impending visit of the American imperialist head Johnson to attend the “Central American Presidential Conference” held there.

The demonstrating students held up banners condemning Johnson, marching towards Liberty Square. Along the way, they shouted, “Yankee Go Home!” “Johnson Get Out!” “(Yankees) Get out of Vietnam!” The demonstrators also distributed leaflets, calling on the people to use rotten eggs to “welcome” Johnson. The angry students also burned an effigy symbolizing American imperialists in front of the American embassy, protesting against the exploitation and plundering of the American imperialists against the people of Central America.

The presidents of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and the United States held a meeting on the 6th in San Salvador to address the crisis of “Central American Economic Integration.” As early as more than ten years ago, American imperialism began to implement this plan to further colonize the economies of the Central American countries; in 1961, American imperialism further pushed this plan, further lowering the prices of Central American products and dumping large quantities of goods, causing these five Central American countries to face a trade deficit year after year, and their economies became increasingly difficult. The working people are fighting for their right to survive, and the situation of the ruling classes in these countries is becoming more and more difficult. In this situation, Johnson personally took action, attempting to repair this much-hyped “Central American Economic Integration.”

    “美国佬滚回去！”“约翰逊滚开！”
    萨尔瓦多学生示威怒逐瘟神
    约翰逊吓得胆颤心惊，狼狈不堪
    新华社七日讯　圣萨尔瓦多消息：萨尔瓦多首都学生在美帝国主义头子约翰逊六日到达这个城市进行罪恶活动时，冲破当地反动军警和美国特务的森严戒备，愤怒地用盛满油漆的瓶子以及鸡蛋和西红柿，向约翰逊乘坐的汽车扔去，使这个美帝头子胆颤心惊，狼狈不堪。
    约翰逊这次到萨尔瓦多，是来参加由他一手策划召开的“中美洲总统会议”的。美帝国主义企图通过这个会议来解决它为进一步控制、奴役中美洲而推行的“中美洲经济一体化”这个殖民计划所面临的危机。
    六日，数百名萨尔瓦多学生在首都又一次举行反美示威，散发谴责约翰逊的传单，愤怒地扯掉了由当局布置在机场周围的一些美国星条旗和欢迎约翰逊的标语牌。他们不顾反动军警的阻挠，还冲到了从机场到市区途中的一个高地上，当约翰逊的车队经过时，他们从写着“约翰逊是杀人犯”的标语牌下，把油漆瓶以及鸡蛋和西红柿往下扔掷。有的鸡蛋正好命中约翰逊坐的汽车，溅满了约翰逊身旁的窗户；还有一些鸡蛋和油漆瓶也打中了跟在约翰逊后面的一些汽车。
    在约翰逊到达的前夕，萨尔瓦多学生曾经在市区举行激烈的抗议示威，他们高呼“美国佬滚回去！”“约翰逊滚开！”等口号。他们撕掉了当局欢迎美帝头子约翰逊的标语，贴上了反美和谴责约翰逊的标语。示威学生还冲到美国大使馆前烧掉了一个象征美帝国主义者的摹拟人像。
    据新华社六日讯　圣萨尔瓦多消息：萨尔瓦多两千多名大学生五日晚在首都圣萨尔瓦多举行声势浩大的示威游行，愤怒抗议美帝头子约翰逊即将前来参加在这里举行的“中美洲总统会议”。
    示威学生高举着谴责约翰逊的标语牌，向着自由广场行进。他们沿途高呼：“美国佬滚回去！”“约翰逊滚开！”“（美国佬）从越南滚出去！”示威者还散发传单，号召人民用臭鸡蛋来“欢迎”约翰逊。愤怒的学生还在美国大使馆的前面焚烧了象征美帝国主义者的摹拟人像，抗议美帝国主义对中美洲人民的剥削和掠夺。
    萨尔瓦多、危地马拉、洪都拉斯、哥斯达黎加、尼加拉瓜五个中美洲国家和美国的总统六日在圣萨尔瓦多举行会议来解决“中美洲经济一体化”的危机。早在十多年前，美帝国主义就开始推行“中美洲经济一体化”这个使中美洲国家的经济进一步殖民地化的计划；一九六一年，美帝国主义更加大力推行这个计划，进一步压低中美洲产品价格和大量倾销商品，使这五个中美洲国家年年出现支付逆差，经济日益困难。劳动人民为争取生存权利展开斗争，这些国家的统治集团的处境越来越困难。在这种情况下，约翰逊亲自出马，妄图修补这个被吹得天花乱坠的“中美洲经济一体化”。
