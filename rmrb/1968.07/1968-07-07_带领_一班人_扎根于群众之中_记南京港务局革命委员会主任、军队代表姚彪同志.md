Maopiao, head of the Revolutionary Committee of Nanjing Port Bureau, was originally the deputy head of the Political Department of a certain hospital in the Nanjing Military Region of the People's Liberation Army. One year ago, he responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao and came to the Port Bureau to support the left. In the past year, carrying Chairman Mao's revolutionary books, with a lunch box slung over his shoulder, he disregarded his own poor health and traversed the vast expanse of the Yangtze River, visiting large and small units affiliated with the Port Bureau. He spent his days mingling with the workers. When problems arose, he sought solutions among the masses; when difficulties emerged, he found strength among the masses. The masses reported their situations to him and confided their troubles. He regarded the masses as his support, and the masses saw him as a trusted friend. After assuming the position of the head of the Revolutionary Committee, he not only continued to trust and rely on the masses, to immerse himself among them, but also, following Chairman Mao's instruction that "the Party Committee must rely on 'this group of people' to fulfill its leadership duties," he led by example, enthusiastically helping other members of the Revolutionary Committee to establish a strong sense of the masses, passing on the Party's good practice of maintaining close ties with the masses and following the mass line in all matters. Thus, the Revolutionary Committee was built into a strong and tightly-knit fighting command center that is closely connected with the masses.

Obtaining supervision from the masses, the Revolutionary Committee can stand unshakable

On March 5, the Revolutionary Committee of the Port Bureau was established. On the third day of its establishment, a group of revolutionary masses from the Technical Department handed Maopiao a small character poster. The poster criticized the Revolutionary Committee for extravagance and waste, stating that it was inappropriate to print and distribute large quantities of announcements about the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee.

Maopiao looked at the small character poster and nodded in approval: "The criticism is correct, it is good!" He immediately called for a meeting with the 21 committee members to discuss the criticism raised in the small character poster.

At the meeting, he first led everyone to read aloud Chairman Mao's quotations: "Because we are serving the people, we should not fear criticism and exposure of our shortcomings. No matter who points out our shortcomings, we should welcome them. As long as you are correct, we will correct our mistakes." Then, he read the small character poster aloud and made a self-criticism: "Printing the announcements was my decision, and I should make the first self-criticism."

After hearing the contents of the small character poster, most of the committee members agreed that the criticism was correct, but some showed a lack of concern. Some said: "If you have opinions, why not raise them face to face? Why write a small character poster?"

Maopiao felt that how to handle this small character poster was a matter of attitude towards the masses and a major issue concerning the style of work the Revolutionary Committee should adopt. It must be seriously addressed. Therefore, he guided everyone to continue discussing this issue. The more the committee members talked, the clearer their minds became. They all said: "The masses trust us and entrust us with power. Listening to the masses' criticism and accepting their supervision is our duty. With the masses' supervision, the Revolutionary Committee can stand unshakable." They unanimously agreed to make a serious self-criticism.

However, when it came to whether to make a public self-criticism, opinions diverged again. Some said: "The Revolutionary Committee has only been established for three days. If we post a self-criticism big character poster on the street, it would be inappropriate!" After listening to everyone's opinions, Maopiao said: "Chairman Mao teaches us that when we make mistakes, we should 'honestly admit our mistakes to the masses and correct them immediately.' This small character poster is the first test the masses have given us to see if our position has changed and if our relationship with the masses has changed. We can only respond to this test with Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line."

After discussion, everyone realized: whether we can correctly handle the masses' criticism is a matter of loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Only by firmly carrying out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line can the Revolutionary Committee continuously establish its authority. To encourage the masses' criticism and supervision, it was unanimously decided to handle this matter with a high attitude and strict requirements. All committee members unanimously passed a resolution: to write a public self-criticism and to post the big character poster from the Technical Department.

That afternoon, the door of the Revolutionary Committee was crowded with people, all looking at the two newly posted big character posters. One was the criticism from the Technical Department's masses towards the Revolutionary Committee; the other was the Revolutionary Committee's sincere self-criticism, calling on all port workers to learn from the comrades in the Technical Department and to supervise the work of the Revolutionary Committee with the attitude of masters. People were reading and praising: "Our Revolutionary Committee is really good!"

From then on, all port workers loved the Revolutionary Committee even more and often gave the Revolutionary Committee criticism and suggestions. The Revolutionary Committee members also became more conscious of listening to the masses' criticism. In addition to frequently going among the masses to solicit opinions, they also strengthened the reception and handling of visits and letters from the masses, recording the masses' opinions and demands item by item. The standing committee members who were at home handled them personally every day, ensuring that every item had a follow-up.

With the support of the masses, the Revolutionary Committee is invincible

On March 30, the editorial of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily, "The Revolutionary Committee is Good," conveyed the latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao: "The Revolutionary Committee should implement unified leadership, break down redundant administrative structures, streamline and reduce bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is closely connected with the masses."

Under the leadership of Maopiao, the committee members of the Nanjing Port Bureau Revolutionary Committee immediately studied this instruction eagerly and repeatedly. During the study, they linked it to the situation of the Port Bureau and discussed the great significance of organizational reform. The more they talked, the more they felt that Chairman Mao's latest instructions had timely pointed out the direction of victory for the Revolutionary Committee. All committee members unanimously decided to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions as quickly as possible. They resolutely reformed the old customs of being detached from the masses, broke down redundant administrative structures, streamlined and reduced bureaucracy, making the Revolutionary Committee take root among the masses and become a vigorous and powerful fighting command center.

As soon as the decision of the Revolutionary Committee was announced, it immediately received strong support from the broad masses and cadres. However, it also encountered obstacles from old habits, and the struggle between new and old thoughts was intense at that time. Under these circumstances, whether to carry out the organizational reform, to do it immediately or to postpone it for a while, also caused heated discussions within the Revolutionary Committee. Some committee members even said: "Let's talk about it later."

How to unify the thoughts within the Revolutionary Committee and firmly advance along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao? One day, Maopiao was working with the workers on the wharf, and an old worker said to him: "Comrade Maopiao, the decision made by the Revolutionary Committee in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions is very good! Some people don't understand, we will argue with them."

The old worker's words gave Maopiao great inspiration. That evening, at the meeting of the Revolutionary Committee, Maopiao and the committee members together reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings: "The masses are the real heroes," etc. Chairman Mao's teachings touched everyone's heart, and they said: "Fish cannot live without water, trees cannot live without roots, the Revolutionary Committee will achieve nothing without the masses." At this time, Maopiao seized the opportunity to ask everyone: "We have encountered difficulties in the issue of organizational reform, what should we do?" The committee members unanimously said: "Seek advice from the masses. Go to the workers to receive education, find strength, and let the worker masses make decisions!"

The comrades of the Revolutionary Committee quickly went to the wharf, cargo yard, and dock, held discussions, talked with the masses, and listened to their opinions. Many workers, through their personal experiences, angrily exposed the crimes of a small group of capitalist roaders within the Party who used the old system to protect bad elements and oppress the masses, and revealed the drawbacks of the old system of overlapping bureaucracy and idle personnel. They strongly demanded the immediate reform of the old system and the change of old practices, and suggested that the Revolutionary Committee allow workers to directly participate in the work of organizational reform.

The workers' personal experiences and powerful language were a vivid class on Mao Zedong Thought, giving the Revolutionary Committee members a great education and encouragement. They said: "After listening to the workers' words, with the workers' support, we have more confidence and courage!" The Revolutionary Committee immediately, according to the workers' opinions, set up a Mao Zedong Thought study class attended by cadres and worker representatives.

In the study class, the broad cadres and workers together studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, jointly criticized the crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the Port Bureau who attempted to restore capitalism, and listed the various drawbacks of the old system and old practices that hindered cadres from connecting with the masses. Through study and carrying out revolutionary criticism, the cadres' awareness of the two-line struggle was further heightened, and they voluntarily requested to go down to the grassroots to become ordinary laborers. The Revolutionary Committee, according to the masses' opinions, drastically reduced two-thirds of the cadres, and organized these cadres into nine Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, which went deep into the wharf, cargo yard, and ship holds to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, participate in labor, and listen to the masses' opinions. At the same time, it was decided that the Revolutionary Committee would always have two-thirds of its members stationed at the grassroots level.

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams composed of cadres became the bridge connecting the Revolutionary Committee with the masses. The committee members often went down to the grassroots level, making the Revolutionary Committee more closely connected with all the workers in the port. Once, the deputy head of the Revolutionary Committee, Liu Lixiang, led several committee members to the wood yard for a grassroots visit. While working with the workers, they discovered: the workers of this brigade had been getting up at four o'clock every day for more than ten years, walking from a village nine miles away to work, affecting their rest and health. They also learned that every morning, the ships in the port had to pass through the village to the wharf to load coal. They suggested that the Revolutionary Committee use the empty ships every day to transport the workers. A long-standing issue that no one had paid attention to was solved. The Revolutionary Committee's actions of closely connecting with the masses and caring for the masses' hardships were highly praised by the workers.

Through the experience of relying on the masses to carry out organizational reform, all the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee received a profound education on the mass line. They deeply felt: "No matter how difficult, relying on the masses makes it easy. With the support of the masses, the Revolutionary Committee is invincible!"

Taking root among the masses, the Revolutionary Committee is invincible

In mid-May, the Revolutionary Committees at various levels in the Port Bureau were successively established, achieving a red tide throughout the port. At this time, the class enemies who were unwilling to perish blew cold winds, lit ghost fires, and incited the counter-revolutionary wind of economism, attempting to tie up the hands and feet of the leaders of various levels of Revolutionary Committees with specific matters, dragging down the Revolutionary Committee.

How to guide the Revolutionary Committees at various levels to eliminate all interference and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle? At this time, Maopiao led everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "The people have limitless creativity," "the masses contain a great socialist enthusiasm," "to concentrate from the masses and return to the masses to form correct leadership opinions, this is the basic leadership method." Chairman Mao's earnest teachings made everyone enlightened. Everyone realized: relying on a few leaders to think hard at home is not enough, we must look downwards and find solutions among the masses, discover typical examples, and guide the general situation. They went deep into the grassroots, conducted investigations and research, and quickly discovered: the committee member of the Bureau Revolutionary Committee, Qiu Yougui, who was stationed in the First Brigade, had been mobilizing the masses at the class and group levels since the establishment of the Brigade Revolutionary Committee, cultivating cadres, and focusing on revolutionary criticism. This made the revolutionary criticism deeply and continuously carried out, firmly striking a small group of class enemies, and resolutely resisting the counter-revolutionary wind of economism, effectively promoting various work. This was the living example to guide the current work. Therefore, at Maopiao's suggestion, a revolutionary criticism on-site meeting was quickly held in the First Brigade.

On a day in June, more than 200 representatives from various units across the port participated in the class criticism meeting of the First Brigade and visited the criticism columns. The representatives were all moved by the advanced deeds of the First Brigade, where everyone was enthusiastic about participating in the criticism, and their spiritual outlook had undergone a great change. They decided to learn from them, using revolutionary criticism as the guiding principle for all work, promoting the smooth development of the revolution and production. The power of examples is boundless. After the on-site meeting, revolutionary criticism was vigorously carried out throughout the port. From workers to family members, from the elderly to children, everyone became a critic; from the cargo yard to the wharf, from the office to the workshop, criticism was carried out everywhere. Revolutionary criticism, like an extremely sharp new weapon, wherever it pointed, the class enemies were terrified and had nowhere to hide; revolutionary criticism made the great alliance of the revolution and the three-in-one combination further consolidated and developed.

The revolutionary spirit displayed by the broad masses in revolutionary criticism turned into a great material force. The port's production broke the quota every day and exceeded the task every month. Old records were continuously broken, and new creations continuously emerged. A group of old workers in the Engineering Brigade, with an average age of 51, dared to innovate and create, and successfully designed and manufactured the first cement barge in the port, which was recently launched.

Countless living facts gave the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee a profound education. They deeply felt: "The power of the masses is invincible, the revolutionary spirit of the masses is boundless. As long as we take root among the masses, absorb the rich nutrients from the masses, and continuously improve ourselves, the Revolutionary Committee can always be full of vitality and advance continuously!"

    带领“一班人”扎根于群众之中
    ——记南京港务局革命委员会主任、军队代表姚彪同志
    南京港务局革命委员会主任姚彪，原是人民解放军南京部队某医院政治处副主任。一年前，他响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，来到港务局支左。这一年，他怀揣毛主席的革命宝书，身挎饭包，不顾多病的身体，踏遍了大江两岸港务局所属大大小小单位，成天跟工人滚在一起。有了问题到群众中去想办法，遇到困难到群众中去找力量。群众有什么情况向他反映，有什么困难找他谈心。他把群众当靠山，群众把他当知己。他担任革委会主任以后，不仅自己仍然处处相信群众，依靠群众，深入到群众中去，而且遵照毛主席“党委要完成自己的领导任务，就必须依靠党委这‘一班人’”的教导，言传身教，热情地帮助革委会其他成员树立坚强的群众观念，传授党的密切联系群众、事事走群众路线的好作风，使革委会建设成为密切联系群众的坚强战斗指挥部。
    得到群众监督，革委会就能立于不败之地
    三月五日，港务局革命委员会成立了。成立的第三天上午，技术科一部分革命群众，塞给姚彪一张小字报。小字报批评革委会铺张浪费，不该大量铅印革委会成立的喜报，到处散发。
    姚彪看着小字报，高兴得连连点头：“提得对，提得好！”马上请二十一位委员，来研究小字报提出的批评。
    会上，他先带领大家齐声朗读毛主席语录：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。”接着，把那张小字报念了一遍，还检查说：“印喜报是我点头的，我要首先作检讨。”
    听了小字报的内容，多数委员说提得对，也有的表现出不以为然的样子。有的说：“有意见当面提嘛，写小字报干啥！”
    姚彪觉得，如何对待这张小字报，是对待群众的态度问题，是关系到革委会树立一种什么样的作风的大问题，一定要认真解决。于是，他引导大家继续围绕这件事进行讨论。委员们越谈脑子越清亮，都说：“群众信得过我们，委托我们掌权，听群众的批评，受群众的监督，这是我们的本分。得到了群众的监督，革委会就能立于不败之地。”一致同意作认真检查。
    但是，当讨论到要不要向群众作公开检讨时，意见又发生了分歧。有的说：“革委会才成立三天，弄张检讨大字报朝马路上一贴，多不好呀！”姚彪听完大家的意见，说：“毛主席教导我们，犯了错误要‘实事求是地公开向群众承认错误，并立即改正。’这张小字报，是群众给我们出的第一张考卷，考考我们地位变了，和群众的关系有没有变。对这张考卷，我们只能用毛主席的无产阶级革命路线来回答。”
    经过讨论，大家认识到：能不能正确对待群众的批评，是对毛主席革命路线忠不忠的大问题。只有坚决执行毛主席的革命路线，革委会才能不断树立自己的威信。为了鼓励群众的批评监督，一致决定要高姿态、严要求地处理好这件事。全体委员一致通过：公开写检讨，并把技术科的小字报写成大字报公布出来。
    当天下午，革委会门口挤满了人，大家都在看新贴出来的两张大字报，一张是技术科的群众对革委会的批评；另一张上面写着革委会的诚恳检讨，还号召全港职工向技术科的同志学习，以主人翁的态度监督革委会的工作。人们边看边称赞：“咱们的革委会就是好！”
    从此，全港职工更加爱护革委会，经常给革委会提出批评建议。革委会全体成员也都更加自觉地听取群众批评。他们除了经常深入群众征求意见以外，还加强了群众来访、来信的接待和处理工作，把群众的意见和要求逐条记下来，在家的常委每天亲自处理，做到条条有着落。
    有了群众支持，革委会就无往而不胜
    三月三十日，《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》的社论《革命委员会好》传达了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”
    南京港务局革委会的委员们在姚彪带领下，立即如饥似渴地、一遍又一遍地学习起来。在学习中，他们联系港务局的情况，大谈机构改革的伟大意义，大家越谈越感到毛主席的最新指示及时地给革委会指出了胜利的航向。全体委员一致决定，以最快的速度落实毛主席的最新指示。坚决改革旧的脱离群众的陈规旧习，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，使革委会扎根于群众之中，成为精悍有力、生气勃勃的战斗指挥部。
    革委会的决定一传开，立即得到广大群众和机关干部的热烈拥护。但是也遇到了旧的习惯势力的阻挠，一时新旧思想斗争很激烈。在这种情况下，机构改革还搞不搞，马上搞还是拖一个时候再搞，在革委会内部也引起了热烈的争论。有的委员甚至说：“缓一步再说吧。”
    怎样统一革委会内部的思想，坚定不移地沿着毛主席指引的航向胜利前进呢？一天，姚彪在码头上和工人共同劳动，一位老工人对他说：“老姚，革委会遵照毛主席的指示作出的决定好得很！有人想不通，我们来和他们辩。”
    老工人的话，使姚彪得到很大启发。当天晚上，在革委会的会议上，姚彪和委员们一起，重温毛主席“群众是真正的英雄”等教导。毛主席的教导，句句说到大家的心坎上，他们说：“鱼离不开水，树离不开根，革委会离开了群众就一事无成。”这时，姚彪因势利导地问大家：“我们在改革机构的问题上遇到了困难，怎么办？”委员们异口同声地说：“去请教群众。到工人中去受教育，找力量，请工人群众拿主意！”
    革委会的同志们很快来到码头、货场、栈桥，开座谈会，找群众谈心，听群众意见。许多工人用自己的切身感受，愤怒控诉党内一小撮走资派利用旧机构保护坏人、欺压群众的滔天罪行，揭露旧机构重重叠叠、人浮于事的坏处，强烈要求迅速改革旧制度，改变旧作风，并且建议革委会让工人直接参加机构改革的工作。
    工人们的现身说法，和铿锵有力的语言，是一堂最生动的毛泽东思想教育课，使革委会全体成员受到极大教育，得到很大鼓舞。他们说：“听了工人的话，有了工人撑腰，我们信心更足了，胆子更壮了！”革委会立即根据工人们的意见，开办由机关干部和工人代表参加的毛泽东思想学习班。
    在学习班里，广大机关干部和工人共同学习毛主席的有关教导，同声狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在港务局的代理人妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，历数旧机构、旧制度妨碍干部联系群众的种种坏处。机关干部通过学习和开展革命大批判，进一步提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，纷纷要求到下面去，当普通劳动者。革委会根据群众的意见，大刀阔斧地裁减了三分之二的机关干部，把这些机关干部组成了九个毛泽东思想宣传队，深入到码头、货场、船舱，宣传毛泽东思想，参加劳动，倾听群众意见。同时，还决定革委会经常有三分之二的委员在下边蹲点。
    由机关干部组成的毛泽东思想宣传队，成了革委会联系群众的纽带，委员们经常下去蹲点，使革委会和全港广大职工联系得更加紧密了。有一次，革委会副主任刘理祥带领几个委员在木材码头蹲点。在和工人共同劳动中，发现：这个大队的工人，十多年来，每天都四点钟起床，要从九里外的宁港一村步行赶来上班，影响休息，影响健康。他们又了解到，每天清晨，港里的船只都要经过宁港一村，到码头来装煤。便建议革委会每天利用装煤的空船把工人们带来。一个长期无人过问的问题解决了。革委会密切联系群众，关心群众疾苦的行动，受到工人们的热烈赞扬。
    通过依靠群众改革机构这件事，使革委会全体同志受到了一次极为深刻的群众路线的教育。他们深有感触地说：“千难万难，依靠群众就不难。有了群众的支持，革委会就无往而不胜！”
    扎根于群众之中，革委会就力量无穷
    五月中旬，港务局各级革委会相继成立，实现了全港一片红。这时，不甘心于灭亡的阶级敌人，吹阴风，点鬼火，煽动反革命经济主义妖风，妄图用一些具体事务缠住各级革委会负责人的手脚，把革委会拖垮。
    怎样引导各级革委会排除一切干扰，牢牢掌握斗争大方向呢？这时候，姚彪又领着大家学习毛主席的教导：“人民群众有无限的创造力”，“群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义的积极性”，“从群众中集中起来又到群众中坚持下去，以形成正确的领导意见，这是基本的领导方法。”毛主席的谆谆教导，使大家豁然开朗。大家认识到：光靠少数几个领导人坐在家里冥思苦想，是想不出什么好点子来的，一定要眼睛向下，到群众中去找办法，发现典型，指导一般。他们深入基层，进行调查研究，很快发现：局革委会委员裘有贵蹲点的一大队，从大队革委会成立以来，始终在班、组深入发动群众，培养骨干，狠抓革命大批判。使革命大批判深入持久地开展起来，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人，坚决抵制了反革命经济主义妖风，有力地推动了各项工作。这正是指导当前工作的活样板。于是，在姚彪建议下，很快在一大队召开了一个革命大批判现场会。
    六月的一天，来自全港各单位二百多名代表，参加了一大队班组批判会，参观了林立的大批判专栏。代表们都为一大队人人斗志昂扬地投入大批判，因而精神面貌发生巨大变化的先进事迹所感动，决心向他们学习，用革命大批判作为一切工作的纲，推动革命和生产顺利发展。榜样的力量是无穷的。现场会后，全港革命大批判轰轰烈烈地开展起来。从工人到家属，从老人到小孩，人人都当批判家；从货场到码头，从科室到车间，处处都摆开了革命大批判的战场。革命大批判如同无比锐利的新式武器，矛头所向，阶级敌人闻风丧胆，无处藏身；革命大批判使革命的大联合和革命的三结合得到了进一步巩固和发展。
    广大职工在革命大批判中焕发出来的革命精神，变成了巨大的物质力量，全港生产天天突破定额，月月超额完成任务。老指标不断打破，新创造不断涌现，工程队平均年龄五十一岁的一批老工人，敢闯敢干，自己设计制造了本港第一艘水泥趸船，最近顺利下水。
    许许多多活生生的事实，使革委会的同志们受到了深刻的教育。他们深有体会地说：“群众的力量无敌，群众的革命精神无穷，只要我们扎根于群众之中，从群众中吸取丰富的营养，不断提高自己，革委会就能永远朝气蓬勃，不断前进！”
