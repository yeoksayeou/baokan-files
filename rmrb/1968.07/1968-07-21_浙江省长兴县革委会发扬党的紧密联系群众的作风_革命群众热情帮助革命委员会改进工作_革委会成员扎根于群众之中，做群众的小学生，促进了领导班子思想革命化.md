The Revolutionary Committee of Changxing County, Zhejiang Province, follows the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "the reform of state organs is fundamentally about linking up with the masses." It has carried forward the Party's style of close ties with the masses, gone deep among the masses, humbly listened to the masses' opinions, accepted the masses' criticisms and supervision, and continuously promoted the thought revolutionization of the leading cadre group.

After the Revolutionary Committee of Changxing County was established, all its members seriously studied Chairman Mao's series of great teachings on close ties with the masses. They deeply realized that whether or not one can maintain close ties with the masses, accept the masses' criticisms and supervision, and be a student of the masses is a major issue that determines whether a member of the Revolutionary Committee is loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. In the first resolution passed by the Revolutionary Committee, they formulated some specific measures for widely, frequently, and closely linking up with the masses. For example, they stipulated that the Revolutionary Committee should regularly invite representatives of revolutionary masses to give opinions; establish a system of rotating duty for standing committee members, with each member setting aside a certain amount of time to handle and process letters and visits from the masses; and report the masses' opinions and demands at every standing committee meeting, etc. After the Revolutionary Committee was established, its members carried Mao Zedong's works, packed their bags, left their offices, climbed mountains and forded streams, went deep into the countryside, propagated Mao Zedong Thought to poor and lower-middle peasants, humbly listened to the masses' opinions, and rooted themselves among the masses, voluntarily placing themselves under the masses' supervision.

The broad revolutionary masses of Changxing County cherish and support the Revolutionary Committee very much. They often enthusiastically give the Revolutionary Committee some criticisms and suggestions. The members of the Changxing County Revolutionary Committee follow the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching to "uphold what is correct for the people's interests and correct what is wrong for the people's interests." As long as the masses' opinions are correct, they humbly accept them. When the Revolutionary Committee was first established, because it had not completely jumped out of the old organizational framework, the organizational setup was too large, and the handling of issues involved many levels and took a long time. The masses criticized this. Based on the masses' opinions, the Revolutionary Committee, on the one hand, organized all members to seriously study Chairman Mao's teaching on "streamlining administration and reducing personnel," and criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Liu Shaoqi in the construction of political power; on the other hand, it mobilized the masses to put forward opinions on reforming overlapping administrative organs. Later, based on widely listening to the masses' opinions, they changed the working organs of the Revolutionary Committee into four groups, and the personnel were reduced from over a hundred to forty, taking a big step toward the goal of streamlining administration and reducing personnel. In February and March of this year, the Revolutionary Committee once fell into the trap of handling some specific matters of the masses' daily production and life, relaxing the leadership of class struggle. At this time, a handful of class enemies took the opportunity to come out and attempted to sabotage the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Revolutionary masses sincerely criticized the Revolutionary Committee, demanding that the members of the Revolutionary Committee remember Chairman Mao's teaching to "never forget class struggle," and more vigorously lead the broad revolutionary masses to take the initiative to attack the class enemies. The members of the Revolutionary Committee humbly accepted the masses' opinions. Through investigation and research, they found some experiences in carrying out struggles against the enemies, mobilized the masses, and quickly launched a high tide of attacking class enemies throughout the county, firmly, accurately, and powerfully striking a handful of class enemies, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Because the Revolutionary Committee's prestige among the masses is getting higher and higher, revolutionary masses encounter some problems and hope to discuss them with the Revolutionary Committee. Should one wait for the masses to come and talk about their opinions, or should one take the initiative to go to the masses to listen to their reflections and calls? The Revolutionary Committee of Changxing County follows Chairman Mao's great teaching to "resolve the relationship between superiors and subordinates well, and handle the relationship between cadres and the masses well. In the future, cadres should go to the lower levels to walk around and see for themselves, insist on the mass line, and consult the masses on everything, and be students of the masses." They take the initiative to go to the masses. They believe that this is not a matter of method, but a major issue concerning whether one can carry forward the Party's style of close ties with the masses, and whether one places oneself in the position of an "official" or a "common person." The members of the county Revolutionary Committee resolutely take the road of close ties with the masses, going to the poor and lower-middle peasants, eating, living, working, studying, and criticizing and reforming together with them. Now, they often have two-thirds of the standing committee members stationed at the grassroots level. From January to June this year, some standing committee members were stationed in the countryside for 108 days. Whenever they go to a place, they listen to the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants through methods such as holding investigation meetings, discussion meetings, and visiting homes, and solve problems at the grassroots level in a timely manner. Some time ago, some poor and lower-middle peasants suggested to the members of the Revolutionary Committee: "You should grasp the thought revolutionization of the commune cadres. Some people have stood up, but their thoughts have not stood up." The county Revolutionary Committee conducted an in-depth investigation and found that the masses' opinions were completely correct. Thus, they held Mao Zedong Thought study classes in batches for the commune cadres, helping the commune cadres further improve their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. In the mountainous area of Meishan Commune, due to the instigation of class enemies, the Revolutionary Committee could not be established for a long time. The county Revolutionary Committee chairman led the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team to go there, conduct investigation and research, listen to the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and analyze the situation with them, firmly grasp the struggle against the enemies, and expose a handful of class enemies, making the Revolutionary Committee quickly established. The county Revolutionary Committee's close ties with the masses and humble acceptance of the masses' opinions have resulted in the broad poor and lower-middle peasants trusting and supporting the Revolutionary Committee more and more. They say: "The comrades of the Revolutionary Committee stand with us poor and lower-middle peasants. They listen to our opinions and quickly correct their shortcomings. The Revolutionary Committee is good!"

Recently, the Revolutionary Committee of Changxing County has seriously studied the experience of the thought revolutionization of the leading cadre group of the Revolutionary Committee of Lingbao County, further mobilized the masses to check and summarize the work of the Revolutionary Committee since its establishment, and decided to establish a new revolutionary style and strive forward on the road to "organizing a revolutionary and mass-linked leading cadre group."

    浙江省长兴县革委会发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风
    革命群众热情帮助革命委员会改进工作
    革委会成员扎根于群众之中，做群众的小学生，促进了领导班子思想革命化
    新华社杭州十九日电　浙江省长兴县革命委员会遵循伟大领袖毛主席“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，大力发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风，深入群众，虚心听取群众的意见，接受群众的批评和监督，不断促进领导班子的思想革命化。
    长兴县革命委员会成立后，全体成员认真学习了毛主席关于密切联系群众的一系列伟大教导，深刻认识到，能不能密切联系群众，接受群众的批评和监督，做群众的小学生，这是衡量每一个革委会成员是不是忠于伟大领袖毛主席的大问题。他们在革委会通过的第一个决议上，就制定了广泛地、经常地、密切地联系群众的一些具体措施，例如规定革委会要定期请革命群众代表提意见；建立常委轮流值班制度，每个常委都要拿出一定时间接待和处理群众来信、来访；每次常委开会时都要汇报群众的意见和要求等等。革委会成立后，革委会的成员们就带着毛主席著作，背上背包，走出办公室，爬山涉水，深入农村，向贫下中农宣传毛泽东思想，虚心倾听群众意见，使自己扎根于群众之中，主动把自己置于群众的监督之下。
    长兴县的广大革命群众，对革委会非常爱护和支持，他们经常热情地向革委会提出一些批评和建议。长兴县革委会成员遵循伟大领袖毛主席
  “为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的”的教导，只要群众的意见是正确的，他们就虚心接受。革委会刚成立时，由于没有完全跳出原来旧机构的圈子，机构设置过大，处理问题层次多，时间拖得长。群众对此提出了批评。根据群众的意见，革委会一方面组织全体成员认真学习毛主席“精兵简政”的教导，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面的反革命修正主义路线；另一方面又深入发动群众对改革重叠的行政机构提出意见。后来，他们在广泛听取群众意见的基础上，将革委会的办事机构改为四个组，人员也由原来的一百多人减为四十人，向精兵简政的目标跨出了一大步。今年二三月间，革委会曾一度陷入处理群众一些日常生产、生活的具体事务的圈子中，放松了对阶级斗争的领导。这时，一小撮阶级敌人趁机跳出来，妄图破坏革命大联合和革命三结合。革命群众向革委会提出了诚恳的批评，要求革委会成员牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，更有力地带领广大革命群众主动向阶级敌人进攻。革委会成员虚心接受群众意见，他们通过调查研究，摸索出开展对敌斗争的一些经验，放手发动群众，迅速在全县范围内掀起了向阶级敌人进攻的高潮，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人，巩固了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
    由于革委会在群众中的威信越来越高，革命群众碰到一些问题，都希望到革委会来谈一谈。是在上面等着群众来谈意见，还是主动到群众中去听取群众的反映和呼声？长兴县革委会遵循毛主席“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”的伟大教导，主动到群众中去。他们认为，这不是什么方法问题，而是关系到能否发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风的大问题，是把自己放在“官”的地位，还是放在“老百姓”的地位的问题。县革委会成员坚决走密切联系群众的道路，到贫下中农中去，同贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同斗私批修。现在，他们经常有三分之二的常委在基层蹲点。今年一至六月份，有的常委就在农村蹲点一百零八天，他们每到一地，就通过开调查会、座谈会、串门访问等方法，广泛听取贫下中农的意见，有问题就及时在基层解决。前些时候，有些贫下中农对革委会成员提出：“你们要抓抓公社干部的思想革命化，有些人虽然站出来了，但思想还没有站出来。”县革委会进行了深入的调查，证明群众的意见提得完全对。于是就分期分批地为公社干部举办毛泽东思想学习班，帮助公社干部进一步提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。地处山区的煤山公社，由于阶级敌人挑拨，革委会迟迟建立不起来。县革委会主任就率领毛泽东思想宣传队到那里，进行调查研究，听取贫下中农意见，和他们一起分析情况，狠抓了对敌斗争，挖出了一小撮阶级敌人，使革委会很快建立了起来。县革委会这样密切联系群众，虚心听取群众意见的结果，广大贫下中农对革委会越来越信任和支持，他们说：“革委会的同志和我们贫下中农站得拢，我们的意见听得进，有缺点改得快，革委会就是好！”
    最近，长兴县革委会认真学习了灵宝县革委会领导班子思想革命化的经验，进一步发动群众检查、总结革委会成立以来的工作，决心树立崭新的革命作风，朝着“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的道路奋勇前进。
