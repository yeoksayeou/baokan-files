The Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee warmly congratulates the Palestinian National Council Conference

The Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the Palestinian people.

We firmly believe that as long as the Palestinian people and the Arab people raise the banner of armed struggle, persist in progress, strengthen unity, dare to fight, and are not afraid of difficulties, they will surely achieve the final victory in the struggle against the aggression of the United States and Israel.

New China News Agency, July 11th: The Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee of China sent a telegram to the Palestinian National Council Conference on the 10th, expressing warm congratulations. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To the Palestinian National Council in Cairo:

On the occasion of the convening of the Palestinian National Council, the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee of China extends warm congratulations to the broad Palestinian people who are bravely fighting against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Israeli aggressors. We wish the Palestinian people continuous victories in their struggle against the U.S. and Israeli aggressors. We wish the conference success in strengthening armed struggle and anti-imperialist unity.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the 700 million Chinese people have consistently and unwaveringly supported the just struggle of the Palestinian people and the peoples of various Arab countries against U.S. and Israeli aggression. We resolutely support the just struggle of the Palestinian people to return to their homeland. The heroic Palestinian people have gone through a painful process of exploration and found that armed struggle is the main form of struggle for liberation, which is a very precious experience. Without armed struggle, there is no status for the people, and there is no victory in the anti-imperialist struggle. Currently, U.S. imperialism and its accomplices are engaged in a series of conspiratorial activities, attempting to sabotage the just struggle of the Palestinian people and the Arab people, but their conspiracies will surely meet with shameful failure.

The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, pointed out, "The world is progressing, the future is bright, and this historical trend cannot be changed by anyone." We firmly believe that as long as the Palestinian people and the Arab people raise the banner of armed struggle, persist in progress, strengthen unity, dare to fight, and are not afraid of difficulties, they will surely achieve the final victory in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel.

    我亚非团结委员会热烈祝贺巴勒斯坦全国委员会大会
    中国人民坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民的正义斗争
    坚信只要巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯人民高举武装斗争旗帜，坚持进步，加强团结，敢于战斗，不怕困难，就一定能够取得反对美以侵略斗争的最后胜利
    新华社十一日讯　中国亚非团结委员会十日打电报给巴勒斯坦全国委员会大会，表示热烈祝贺。电报全文如下：开罗巴勒斯坦全国委员会：
    值此巴勒斯坦全国委员会开会之际，中国亚非团结委员会向英勇反对美帝国主义及其走狗以色列侵略者的广大巴勒斯坦人民表示热烈祝贺，祝巴勒斯坦人民在抗击美、以侵略者的斗争中，不断取得新的胜利，祝大会在加强武装斗争，加强反帝团结的目标下取得成功。
    在毛泽东思想教导下的七亿中国人民，一贯地坚定不移地支持巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯各国人民反对美、以侵略的正义斗争，坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民重返家园的正义斗争。英雄的巴勒斯坦人民经历了一个艰苦的摸索过程，找到了以武装斗争作为争取解放的主要斗争形式，这是一个十分宝贵的经验。离开了武装斗争，就没有人民的地位，就没有反帝斗争的胜利。目前美帝国主义及其帮凶正在进行一系列的阴谋活动，妄图破坏巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯人民的正义斗争，它们的阴谋必将遭到可耻的失败。
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席指出，“世界是在进步的，前途是光明的，这个历史的总趋势任何人也改变不了。”我们坚信，只要巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯人民高举武装斗争的旗帜，坚持进步，加强团结，敢于战斗，不怕困难，就一定能够在反对美帝及其侵略工具以色列的斗争中，取得最后胜利。
    中国亚非团结委员会　一九六八年七月十日于北京
