The trade war between imperialist countries is intensifying. The powerful strike struggles of the working class in France and other European countries have dealt a heavy blow to the monopoly bourgeoisie of these countries, further exacerbating the contradictions between imperialist powers, and making the tariff and trade wars between European and North American imperialist countries more acute.

The ruling cliques of European and North American imperialist countries, in order to alleviate their serious political and economic crises and maintain the interests of the monopoly bourgeoisie, have, in addition to intensifying the exploitation of their own people, adopted the tactic of "scapegoating" neighboring countries. They strive to expand the export of their own commodities, restrict and reduce the import of commodities from other countries, monopolize their own markets, seize the markets of other countries, and shift the crisis to other countries. The tariffs imposed on imported commodities are a means they use to protect themselves and strangle others. Therefore, there has always been fierce struggle between imperialist countries over tariff issues.

The U.S. and British imperialists, due to their continuous occurrence of huge international payment deficits, have pinned their hopes of making up the deficit on strengthening exports to the West European "Common Market." They demand that West European countries lower tariffs so that U.S. and British commodities can be exported more to West Europe, thereby obtaining large trade surpluses. However, the West European "Common Market" countries, in order to prevent their own monopoly capital from being squeezed out by foreign competitors, also use every opportunity to strengthen exports to the U.S., Britain, and other member countries of the "Common Market." This has formed an increasingly fierce tariff and trade war between imperialist countries.

Since the beginning of this year, as the political and economic crises of capitalism have deepened, the struggle between imperialist countries to seize markets has become more acute. In the first five months of this year, U.S. imports increased sharply, and in March and May, trade deficits totaling $190 million were recorded. The trade surplus for the first five months was only $970 million, while last year's trade surplus was $4.1 billion. Britain's trade deficit for the first five months was £370 million, while last year it was only £102 million. On the other hand, the West European "Common Market" had a trade surplus of $470 million in the first quarter, equivalent to half of last year's annual trade surplus. The "Common Market" countries' exports to the U.S. and Britain have all increased, with West Germany increasing the most by 40.7% and the Netherlands the least by 23.4% compared to the first quarter of last year. In the trade between "Common Market" countries and non-member countries, except for West Germany with a large surplus and France with a slight surplus, other countries have deficits; these countries urgently need to expand "Common Market" internal trade to make up for it. This situation shows that the struggle to seize markets between the U.S., Britain, and the West European "Common Market," as well as within the "Common Market," has intensified.

In order to reverse the unfavorable situation, the U.S. this year has threatened to implement measures to protect its domestic market, forcing the West European "Common Market" to agree to accelerate the implementation of the so-called "Kennedy Round" negotiation agreement. According to this agreement, the U.S. and West European countries will reduce tariffs on specified commodities by 35% in five stages. The U.S. made the first reduction in January this year and will make the second reduction in January next year. West European countries agreed to make two reductions simultaneously on July 1 this year. Starting from July 1, the "Common Market" will implement a common external tariff, and the average tariff rate of the six countries (France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) to the outside world will be reduced to 10.7%, while the average tariff rates of the U.S. and Britain will be 17.6% and 18.4%, respectively. In other words, the "Common Market" will pay higher tariffs for exports to the U.S. and Britain, while the U.S. and Britain will pay lower tariffs for exports to the "Common Market," which is very beneficial for the U.S. and Britain to expand exports to the "Common Market" in the second half of this year.

At the same time, in order to expand internal trade within the "Common Market," starting from July 1, all industrial tariffs between the six countries will be abolished, and industrial products will no longer be subject to tariffs when circulating among the six countries. For agricultural products, except for items such as tobacco, fish, alcohol, bananas, coffee, and honey, tariff restrictions will also be abolished. After the abolition of internal tariff barriers, some monopoly capital groups that have advantages in product manufacturing technology and enterprise management will be able to gain a favorable competitive position for their products in the markets of other member countries. The struggle among "Common Market" countries to seize the internal market will also become more acute.

Among the six countries in the "Common Market," France's industry is relatively backward, and its competitiveness is relatively weak. The French government, in order to protect the interests of French monopoly capital, has always adopted a high tariff policy. The abolition of tariff barriers within the "Common Market" has resulted in the largest reduction in France's total tariffs, far exceeding that of other countries. In the unified external tariff of the "Common Market," France's average tariff rate will drop from 14.4% to 10.7%, which is the largest drop among the six countries. This shows that after the changes in internal and external tariffs of the "Common Market," France will be in the most unfavorable position in the fierce trade war.

The strike struggles of the French working class have dealt a heavy blow to the French monopoly bourgeoisie, deepening France's predicament. It is estimated that the general strike of French workers will reduce France's industrial output value by at least 6% this year, causing French monopoly capital to lose 30 billion francs. Due to the general strike causing delays in delivery, France's exports have decreased by one-third. France's international payment situation has deteriorated, the position of the franc has shaken, forcing the French government to use a large amount of gold and foreign exchange reserves. The measures taken by the French monopoly bourgeoisie to transfer losses by raising product prices will cause French commodities to be more expensive than imported commodities, resulting in a situation where France's exports decrease and imports increase. This will cause France's industrial production to suffer more severe blows from foreign competition, and France's political and economic crisis will further deepen.

Under this situation, the French ruling clique, on the one hand, in order to maintain France's political position in Western Europe, has to declare that France will abide by the agreement and abolish tariffs on other "Common Market" countries starting from July 1, and reduce tariffs on countries outside the "Common Market"; on the other hand, in order to protect the interests of French monopoly capital, it implements restrictions on imports and expands exports. The French government announced that starting from July 1, it will implement a quota system for six months on the import of commodities such as steel, automobiles, household electrical appliances, and textiles, and at the same time provide a "temporary subsidy" for French export commodities for six months, and reduce the interest rate on export credit. The French government openly stated that whether France will abolish internal tariffs of the "Common Market" depends on whether other countries in the "Common Market" agree to these protective measures.

France's measures have caused a great stir among imperialist countries. Other member countries of the "Common Market" are indignant that France unilaterally announced these measures without obtaining their consent. Because of this, France's commodities can enter other member countries tax-free, while the commodities of other member countries entering France will be restricted. Countries such as Belgium, Italy, and West Germany, which export more commodities to France, are particularly dissatisfied. Under the pressure of these countries, France had to make some concessions and agreed to implement these measures after discussion in the "Common Market" Commission. Although other member countries are dissatisfied with France, they are also afraid that France's economic collapse will drag them down, so they eventually had to agree to France's approach.

The monopoly bourgeoisie of the U.S. and Britain have long been preparing to strengthen exports to France and make a big profit from the opportunity of the "Common Market" lowering external tariffs. Therefore, they are very angry about France's protective measures. British monopoly capitalists are demanding that the government take countermeasures. The U.S. openly threatened to retaliate against France. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has formally announced that if France implements export subsidies, the U.S. will impose "countervailing tariffs" on French commodities to weaken the competitiveness of French commodities in the U.S. market. This indicates that the contradictions between the U.S. and French monopoly bourgeoisie will further intensify.

Now, U.S. officials are gleefully predicting that in the second half of this year, U.S. exports will increase and imports will decrease, and the trade surplus will increase compared to the first half. However, the West European "Common Market" in its second-quarter report is worried that the trade balance situation will worsen in the second half. This portends that there will be a more intense trade war between imperialist countries in the second half of this year. As Stalin once pointed out, the fierce struggle between various capitalist groups "weakens the imperialists against each other, weakens the entire capitalist camp, accelerates the advent of the proletarian revolution, and makes the proletarian revolution inevitable."

### 帝国主义国家之间的贸易战在加剧

    帝国主义国家之间的贸易战在加剧
    法国和欧洲其他国家工人阶级强大的罢工斗争，沉重地打击了这些国家垄断资产阶级，并且进一步加剧了帝国主义之间的矛盾，使欧洲、北美帝国主义国家之间的关税战、贸易战更加尖锐化了。
    欧洲、北美的帝国主义国家的统治集团，为了缓和它们严重的政治、经济危机，维护垄断资产阶级的利益，除了加紧剥削本国人民以外，都采取以邻为壑的手段，力图扩大本国商品的出口，限制和减少别国商品的进口，以垄断本国市场、夺取其他国家的市场，把危机转嫁给别的国家。对进口商品征收的关税，就是它们用来保护自己、扼杀别人的一种手段。因此，在帝国主义国家之间，历来在关税问题上存在激烈的斗争。
    美、英帝国主义由于连年出现巨额国际收支赤字，把弥补赤字的希望寄托在加强对西欧“共同市场”的出口上，它们要求西欧国家降低关税，使美英商品可以更多地向西欧出口，以便得到大量的贸易盈余。而西欧“共同市场”国家为了使本国垄断资本不被外国竞争者挤垮，也利用一切机会加强对美、英以及“共同市场”其他成员国的出口。这就形成了帝国主义国家之间日益激烈的关税战和贸易战。
    今年以来，随着资本主义政治经济危机的加深，帝国主义国家之间争夺市场的斗争，更加尖锐。今年头五个月，美国的进口急剧增加，三月份和五月份连续出现共达一亿九千万美元的贸易赤字，头五个月贸易盈余年率只达到九亿七千万美元，而去年的贸易盈余却有四十一亿美元。英国头五个月有形贸易的赤字达到三亿七千万英镑，而去年同期只有一亿零二百万英镑。另一方面，西欧“共同市场”第一季度的贸易盈余却达到四亿七千万美元，相当于去年全年贸易盈余的一半。“共同市场”各国对美国和英国的出口都有所增长，与去年第一季度比较，西德最多，增长了百分之四十点七；荷兰最少，也增长了百分之二十三点四。而在“共同市场”各国对非成员国的贸易中，除了西德有大量盈余、法国稍有盈余外，其他国家都有逆差；这些国家极其需要用扩大“共同市场”内部的贸易来加以弥补。这个情况表明，在美国、英国和西欧“共同市场”之间，以及在“共同市场”内部，争夺市场的斗争都加剧了。
    美国为了扭转对它不利的情况，今年以实行保护本国市场的措施相威胁，迫使西欧“共同市场”同意加速实施所谓“肯尼迪回合”谈判协议。按照这个协议，美国和西欧国家要在五年内对规定的商品分五次削减关税百分之三十五。美国在今年一月作了第一次削减，明年一月再作第二次削减。西欧国家答应在今年七月一日同时进行两次削减。从七月一日起，西欧“共同市场”对外部实行共同关税，“共同市场”六国（法国、西德、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡）对外关税的平均率降低为百分之十点七，而美国和英国的平均关税率分别为百分之十七点六和百分之十八点四。换句话说，“共同市场”向美、英出口要付较高的关税，而美、英向“共同市场”出口却只要付较低的关税，这对美国和英国在今年下半年扩大向“共同市场”出口是十分有利的。
    同时，为了扩大“共同市场”内部的贸易，从七月一日起，“共同市场”六国之间取消一切工业关税，工业品在六国间流通不再缴纳关税。农产品方面，除烟草、鱼、酒、香蕉、咖啡、蜂蜜等项目外，也取消关税限制。在内部关税壁垒取消以后，一些在产品的制造技术以及企业经营管理等方面具有优势的垄断资本集团，就可以使自己的商品在其他成员国的市场上取得有利的竞争地位。“共同市场”各国争夺内部市场的斗争也就更加尖锐化了。
    在“共同市场”六国中，法国工业比较落后，竞争能力比较差。法国政府为了保护法国垄断资本的利益，一向采取高关税政策。“共同市场”内部取消关税壁垒，法国的总关税下降的幅度最大，远远超过其他国家。而在“共同市场”实行统一的对外关税中，法国的平均关税率将从百分之十四点四下降到百分之十点七，也是六国中下降最多的。这说明在“共同市场”的内部和外部关税改变以后，法国在激烈的贸易战中将处于最不利的地位。
    法国工人阶级的罢工斗争给予法国垄断资产阶级的沉重打击，加深了法国的困境。据估计，法国工人的大罢工，至少将使今年法国工业生产总值减少百分之六，使法国垄断资本丧失三百亿法郎。由于大罢工引起不能如期交货，使法国出口贸易减少了三分之一。法国的国际收支状况恶化，法郎地位动摇，迫使法国政府不得不动用大量黄金外汇储备。法国垄断资产阶级为了转嫁损失而采取的提高产品价格的措施，使法国商品的价格高于进口的商品，将造成法国出口减少，进口增加的局面。这使法国的工业生产在外国竞争下受到更严重打击，法国的政治经济危机也将进一步加深。
    在这种形势下，法国统治集团一方面为了维持法国在西欧的政治地位，不得不表示法国将遵照协议，从七月一日起取消对“共同市场”其它国家的关税，并降低对“共同市场”以外的国家的关税；另一方面，为了保护法国垄断资产阶级的利益，实行限制进口，扩大出口。法国政府宣布，从七月一日起，将对钢、汽车、家庭电器用具、纺织品等商品的进口，实行六个月的限额制度，同时对法国的出口商品实行六个月的“临时补助”，并降低出口信贷的利率。法国政府公开表示，法国是否取消“共同市场”内部关税，取决于“共同市场”其他国家是否同意法国的这些保护性措施。
    法国的措施在帝国主义国家中引起了轩然大波。“共同市场”的其他成员国，对于法国事先没有取得它们的同意，单方面宣布这些措施，纷纷表示愤慨。因为这样一来，法国的商品将可以免税进入其他成员国，而其他成员国的商品进入法国却要受到限制。向法国出口商品较多的比利时、意大利、西德特别不满。在这些国家的压力下，法国不得不稍作让步，答应在“共同市场”委员会讨论以后再实施这些措施，而其他成员国虽然对法国不满，但是又怕法国经济垮台连累自己遭殃，所以最后还是不得不同意了法国的做法。
    美国和英国的垄断资产阶级，早就准备趁“共同市场”降低外部关税的机会，加强对法国的出口，从中大捞一把。因此，它们对法国的保护性措施十分恼怒。英国垄断资本纷纷要求政府采取对付办法。美国公开威胁要对法国进行反击。美国财政部已经正式宣布，如果法国对出口实行补助，美国就要对法国商品征收“抵销关税”，以削弱法国商品在美国市场上的竞争能力。这表明美国和法国垄断资产阶级之间的矛盾将进一步尖锐起来。
    现在，美国官方在沾沾自喜地预言，今年下半年美国的出口将要增加，进口将要减少，贸易盈余将比上半年有所增长。而西欧“共同市场”在它的第二季度报告中，则担心下半年贸易平衡的情况将要恶化。这预兆着今年下半年帝国主义国家之间将有一场更加激烈的贸易战。而正如斯大林曾经指出的，各资本家集团之间的疯狂斗争，“使帝国主义者彼此削弱，使整个资本主义阵地削弱，使无产阶级革命的时机加速到来，使无产阶级革命必然实现”。
