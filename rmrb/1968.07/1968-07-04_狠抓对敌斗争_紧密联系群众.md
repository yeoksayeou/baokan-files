Title: Intensify the Struggle Against the Enemy and Maintain Close Ties with the Masses

As the entire nation's military and civilian population is vigorously advancing towards the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and enthusiastically celebrating the 47th anniversary of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao received more than twenty thousand representatives from the People's Liberation Army and revolutionary workers. The *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *Liberation Army Daily* published important editorials commemorating the 47th anniversary of the Party's founding. This is the greatest care and encouragement for the entire nation's military and civilian population, and it is also a great battle call issued to all Party members and proletarian revolutionaries, especially to the personnel of our various revolutionary committees.

Throughout our Party's glorious history, Chairman Mao has always been a shining example of deep connection with the masses and close ties with them. Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most and cherishes them the most. In Chairman Mao's brilliant works, the people are always elevated to the position of masters of history. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has repeatedly received millions of cultural revolutionaries from all over the country. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao affectionately instructed us: "You must prioritize politics, go among the masses, and work together with them to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." In the face of the decisive victory of the Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao issued the extremely important latest directive: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's latest directive elevates the issue of connecting with the masses and protecting them to the level of distinguishing the nature of the regime, which is a great development of Marxism-Leninism.

Chairman Mao's latest directive teaches us that the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines is essentially a struggle between suppressing the enemy and protecting the masses versus suppressing the masses and protecting the enemy. At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the reactionary line of the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev was to suppress the masses and protect the enemy. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, millions of revolutionary masses emerged from the white terror, seized power from the hands of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and created the great new thing—the revolutionary committee. This new revolutionary regime, in terms of its line of action, personnel composition, and organizational form, has the distinctive feature of connecting with the masses and representing them. It always protects the broadest revolutionary masses and resolutely suppresses a handful of class enemies. Because of this, the class enemies will try every means to attempt to separate and disrupt the connection between our revolutionary committees and the broad masses. We must remain sober-minded and expose the tricks and deceits of the class enemies.

Just as the revolutionary committees are leading the broad revolutionary masses in launching a fierce attack against a handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders as well as other counter-revolutionaries, they spread the rumor: "The main contradiction has now shifted, the contradiction between the revolutionary committees and the broad masses is the main contradiction." This "shift of the main contradiction" theory is a replica of China's Khrushchev's view that the Socialist Education Movement is about the "contradiction between the four cleans and the four uncleans," deliberately obscuring the class content of the contradiction, reversing the enemy-people relationship, and maliciously aiming to overthrow the revolutionary committees that resolutely protect the masses. When the struggle against the enemy deepens further, and the class enemies who have hidden for a longer time are about to be exposed by the broad revolutionary masses, they either continue to incite bourgeois factionalism, hiding behind the scenes to spread cold winds and ignite ghost fires, stirring up the masses to fight each other; or they deliberately expand the scope of attacks, attempting to disrupt our class lines and shift the direction of the revolutionary struggle, so that they can fish in troubled waters and lie in wait for a counterattack. In addition, a handful of class enemies also use the evil tactic of firing sugar-coated bullets, attempting to seduce or corrupt our comrades, causing some members of the revolutionary committees to become detached from the masses, and even be captured by them.

Therefore, today, as we commemorate the 47th anniversary of the Party's founding and further carry forward the Party's fine tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses, it is particularly necessary to seriously study Chairman Mao's latest directive and a series of directives on the Party's style of work, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and firmly rely on the proletarian revolutionaries, uniting all forces that can be united, to accurately and resolutely strike at a handful of class enemies. Throughout the entire period of socialist revolution, the contradiction between a handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders as well as all other counter-revolutionaries and the proletariat and the broad revolutionary people is always the main contradiction. We must firmly grasp this main contradiction and not let it shift. As for the broad revolutionary masses, at any time and under any circumstances, we must firmly rely on them, protect them, honestly learn from them, and wholeheartedly serve them. Especially at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is developing in depth and comprehensive victory is not far away, we, the comrades in Shanghai, need to humbly learn from the working class in the capital, take them as our example, and in the struggle against the enemy, maintain close ties with the masses, delve into reality, and frequently study, labor, and fight together with the workers and peasants. We must earnestly and solidly do a good job in investigation and research, and strive to achieve what Chairman Mao has taught us: "We should cherish any small socialist initiative of the peasants and cadres," and use Mao Zedong Thought to carefully summarize and promote it, so that our work can continuously "discover, invent, create, and advance."

    狠抓对敌斗争　紧密联系群众
    上海市革命委员会领导成员　王少庸
    正当全国亿万军民在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的征途中，生气勃勃地迎接伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党成立四十七周年的时候，我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席接见了两万多名人民解放军和革命职工的代表，《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》又发表了纪念党成立四十七周年的重要社论，这是对全国军民的最大关怀、最大鼓舞，同时也是对广大共产党员和无产阶级革命派，特别是对我们各级革命委员会的工作人员，发出的伟大战斗号召。
    在我们党的光荣历史上，毛主席一直是深入群众、联系群众的光辉典范。毛主席最信任群众，最爱护群众。在毛主席的光辉著作中，处处把人民群众提高到历史主人翁的地位。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席更是一次又一次地接见了来自全国各地的千百万文化革命大军。在文化大革命刚兴起的时候，毛主席就亲切地教导我们：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”在文化大革命已经取得了决定性胜利的一片大好形势下，毛主席又作出了极其重要的最新指示：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”毛主席的最新指示把联系群众、保护群众的问题提到了区别政权性质的高度，这是对马克思列宁主义的伟大发展。
    毛主席的这一最新指示教导我们，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，实质上也就是镇压敌人、保护群众还是镇压群众、保护敌人的斗争。在无产阶级文化大革命初期，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部所推行的资产阶级反动路线，就是镇压群众、保护敌人的。在毛主席无产阶级革命路线指引下，亿万革命群众从白色恐怖下冲杀出来，夺了党内一小撮走资派手里的权，创造了伟大的新生事物——革命委员会。这个崭新的革命政权，从它所执行的路线、人员的组成、组织的形式，一个最大的特点就是联系群众、代表群众。它永远保护最广大革命群众，坚决镇压一小撮阶级敌人。正因为这样，阶级敌人就要千方百计地企图离间和破坏我们革命委员会同广大群众的联系，我们必须保持清醒的头脑，戳穿阶级敌人的阴谋诡计。
    正当革命委员会领导广大革命群众向一小撮叛徒、特务和顽固不化的走资派以及其他反革命分子发起猛烈进攻的时候，他们放出空气说：“现在主要矛盾已经转移，革命委员会和广大群众的矛盾是主要矛盾。”这种“主要矛盾转移”论是中国赫鲁晓夫认为社会主义教育运动是什么“四清和四不清的矛盾”的翻版，故意抹杀矛盾的阶级内容，颠倒敌我关系，其恶毒的目的就是妄图搞垮坚决保护群众的革命委员会。而当对敌斗争进一步深入，隐藏得更深、更久的阶级敌人即将被广大革命群众挖出来的时候，他们或者继续煽起资产阶级派性，躲在背后刮阴风，点鬼火，挑动群众斗群众；或者故意扩大打击面，企图扰乱我们的阶级阵线，转移革命斗争的大方向，以便他们浑水摸鱼，潜伏下来伺机反攻。除此以外，一小撮阶级敌人还利用施放糖衣炮弹的恶毒手法，妄图诱骗或腐蚀我们的同志，使革命委员会的某些成员脱离群众，甚至被他们俘虏过去。
    因此，今天，当我们纪念党的成立四十七周年，进一步发扬党的紧密联系群众的优良作风的时候，就特别需要认真学习毛主席的这一最新指示和一系列论述我党作风的指示，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚决依靠无产阶级革命派，团结一切可以团结的力量，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。在整个社会主义革命时期，一小撮叛徒、特务和顽固不化的走资派以及其他一切反革命分子同无产阶级和广大革命人民的矛盾，始终是主要矛盾，我们一定要狠抓这个主要矛盾不转向。而对广大革命群众，在任何时候、任何情况下，都要坚决地依靠他们，保护他们，老老实实地向他们学习，全心全意地做他们的勤务员。特别是在无产阶级文化大革命正在向纵深发展、全面胜利已经不远的今天，我们上海的同志，更加需要虚心地向首都工人阶级学习，以他们为榜样，在狠抓对敌斗争中联系群众，深入实际，经常和工农群众同学习、同劳动、同战斗，扎扎实实地做好调查研究，努力做到象毛主席所教导我们的那样，“应当爱惜农民和干部的任何一点微小的社会主义积极性”，并且用毛泽东思想认真地加以总结和推广，使我们的各项工作不断“有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”。
