New China News Agency, July 10 — Tonight, Albanian Military Attaché to China, Hakan, hosted a reception to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Albanian People's Army.

Attending the reception were Politburo Standing Committee member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Kang Sheng; Mayor of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, Xie Fuzhi; Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Huang Yongsheng; Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Wu Faxian; Vice Premiers of the State Council, Chen Yi and Li Xiannian.

Also invited to the reception were leaders from various departments, branches, and services of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and relevant departments, including Su Yu, Xiao Jinguang, Wang Shusheng, Wang Xinting, Wen Yuceng, Lin Haiyun, Qiao Guanhua, Ding Guoyu, and Ding Xilin.

At the reception, filled with the great friendship and combat unity between the peoples and armies of the two countries, Albanian Chargé d'Affaires to China, Baba, and Politburo Standing Committee member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Kang Sheng, toasted in succession. They proposed a toast to the health of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the great leader of the Albanian people, Enver Hoxha.

Comrade Hakan and Comrade Huang Yongsheng spoke in succession. Comrade Hakan said that this year, our people are more united than ever around the Albanian Party of Labor, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, celebrating the July 10 Army Day in a great situation. He said that the establishment, organization, and continuous revolutionization of the people's army, this primary task, has been successfully resolved by our party and its founder, Comrade Enver Hoxha.

Comrade Hakan said that the Albanian People's Army is a new type of army tempered with the revolutionary ideology of Marxism-Leninism and with political and ideological quality. Our army's victory over Italian and German fascism once again proved the correctness of the brilliant theory of Marxism-Leninism, that the decisive factor in victory is not weapons and military technology, not a large army, but first and foremost the high class consciousness and revolutionary determination of the people. These people are fighting for the cause of justice, national liberation, against social oppression, to eliminate the reactionary ruling class, and to build a new world without exploitation of man by man.

Comrade Hakan exposed the crimes of modern revisionism centered around the leadership of the CPSU, which has betrayed the revolutionary cause and is completely loyal to the various crimes of imperialism led by the United States. He pointed out that the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, on the one hand, strives to make the people of various countries who love freedom abandon their just struggle against the slavery of colonialism and feudalism. On the other hand, they defend their cooperation with the United States to dominate the world and divide spheres of influence. They sign various treaties to strike and attempt to isolate China. But the dreams of imperialism and revisionism are forever an unrealizable dream of yellow millet. Glorious People's China has never been as strong as it is today. She enjoys high international prestige, has an invincible army, a developed economy, and modern science. China's sincere friends are all over the world. Seven hundred million Chinese people, under the strong leadership of the outstanding Marxist-Leninist, Chairman Mao, have achieved brilliant victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. People's China will forever be red, striding forward at the forefront of the revolution, making imperialism and modern revisionism tremble with fear, and is a reliable pillar for all peace-loving people in the world.

Comrade Hakan said that the brotherly friendship between the peoples and armies of the two countries is based on the lofty principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and this friendship will be continuously strengthened. The heroic parties of the two countries, led by our beloved leaders, Mao Zedong and Enver Hoxha, are the reliable guarantee of this friendship. Our two parties are tempering this friendship in the revolutionary fires of opposing imperialism and revisionism, and in the socialist construction of the two countries.

Comrade Hakan, when talking about the attempts of American imperialism and its running dogs and modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist traitor clique to attack Albania, said that our people, men, women, old and young, together with the people's army, with one hand holding a pickaxe and the other holding a gun, are increasingly raising revolutionary vigilance and accelerating socialist construction. Our people and army will never sleep in front of the enemy. Any adventurous activities of the enemy, no matter where they come from, no matter how large the scale, will inevitably suffer a shameful failure.

Comrade Huang Yongsheng, in his speech, warmly congratulated the heroic Albanian People's Army on its brilliant victories in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism, and in strengthening its revolutionary construction!

He pointed out that the heroic Albanian People's Army is a people's army personally created and cultivated by the Albanian Party of Labor and Comrade Enver Hoxha. As Comrade Enver Hoxha pointed out, the Albanian People's Army is "one of the most important weapons of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and is the armed force loved by workers, peasants, and all laboring people of the nation." We sincerely wish the brotherly Albanian People's Army new and greater victories in defending and building the socialist motherland, and in strengthening its revolutionary construction!

Comrade Huang Yongsheng said that we are now in a new and great era of world revolution. The forces of Marxism-Leninism around the world are becoming increasingly strong, and the revolutionary consciousness of the people of various countries has reached an unprecedented height. The armed struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism are developing. The volcano under the feet of American imperialism is erupting. The modern revisionist clique centered around the Soviet revisionist traitor clique is more disintegrated. Our great leader, Chairman Mao, pointed out: "Let the people of the world unite more closely, launch a sustained and powerful attack on our common enemy, American imperialism and its accomplices! It can be foreseen that the thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation, and the thorough liberation of all oppressed peoples and oppressed nations, is not far off."

Comrade Huang Yongsheng said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader, Chairman Mao, has already achieved decisive victories. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, advance victoriously, and achieve an overall victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Huang Yongsheng said that the two parties, two countries, and two armies of China and Albania are the closest comrades and fellow fighters. Our goals of struggle are the same. Our hearts are closely connected. Our great friendship and combat unity are based on the principles of proletarian internationalism, and have been tempered in the great struggle against imperialism, against modern revisionism, and against the reactionaries of various countries. "No matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely stand together, fight together, and win together."

    新华社十日讯　阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使馆武官哈卡尼今晚举行招待会，庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民军建军二十五周年。

    在充满着中阿两国人民和两国军队之间伟大友谊和战斗团结的招待会上，阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使馆临时代办巴巴尼同志和中共中央政治局常委康生同志先后祝酒，他们提议，为中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的健康和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的健康，干杯。
    哈卡尼同志和黄永胜同志先后讲话。哈卡尼同志说，今年，我国人民比以往任何时候都更紧密地团结在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的周围，在大好形势下庆祝七月十日建军节。他说，人民军的建立、组织和不断革命化，这一首要的任务，由我们党及其缔造者恩维尔·霍查同志胜利地解决了。
    哈卡尼同志说，阿尔巴尼亚人民军是一支用马克思列宁主义的革命思想锻炼出来的，有政治思想素养的新型的军队。我军对意、德法西斯的胜利，再一次证实了马克思列宁主义这一光辉学说的正确性，即决定胜利的不是武器和军事技术，不是庞大的军队，而首先是人的高度的阶级觉悟和革命决心。这些人是为争取正义事业、民族解放、反对社会压迫、消灭反动统治阶级、建立一个没有人剥削人的新世界而战斗的。
    哈卡尼同志揭露以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，背叛了革命的事业，完全效忠于以美国为首的帝国主义的种种罪行。他指出，苏修叛徒集团一方面竭力使各国爱好自由的人民放弃他们反对殖民主义和封建主义的奴役的正义斗争。另一方面，为它们同美帝合作主宰世界，划分势力范围作辩护。它们签订各种条约打击和企图孤立中国。但是，帝国主义和修正主义的梦想，永远是不可实现的黄粱一梦。光荣的人民中国从来没有象今天这样强大。她享有崇高的国际威望，有无敌的军队，有发达的经济和现代化的科学，中国的真诚的朋友遍天下。七亿中国人民在以杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛主席为首的中国共产党的坚强的领导下，在无产阶级文化大革命中取得了光辉胜利。人民中国将永远是鲜红的，她昂首阔步走在革命的最前列，使帝国主义、现代修正主义怕得要死，是世界一切爱好和平的人民的可靠支柱。
    哈卡尼同志说，阿中两国人民和军队之间的兄弟友谊，是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的崇高原则基础上的，这种友谊将不断巩固。以我们两国敬爱的领袖毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志为首的两国的英雄的党，是这一友谊的可靠保证。我们两党在反对帝国主义、修正主义的革命战火中、在两国的社会主义建设中，正在锤炼这种友谊。
    哈卡尼同志在谈到美帝国主义及其走狗和以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义企图袭击阿尔巴尼亚的时候说，我国人民，男女老少，和人民军一起，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，日益提高革命警惕性，并加速建设社会主义。我国人民和军队永远不会在敌人面前睡大觉。敌人的任何冒险活动，不管从那里来，不管规模多大，都必将遭到可耻的失败。
    黄永胜同志在讲话中热烈祝贺兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民军在反帝、反修斗争中，在加强自己的革命化建设中所取得的光辉胜利！
    他指出，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民军，是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和恩维尔·霍查同志亲自创建、亲自培育出来的一支人民军队。正如恩维尔·霍查同志指出的，阿尔巴尼亚人民军是阿尔巴尼亚“无产阶级专政的最重要的武器之一，是工农和全国劳动群众所爱戴的武装力量。”我们衷心祝愿兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民军在保卫和建设社会主义祖国，在加强自己的革命化建设中，不断取得新的更大的胜利！
    黄永胜同志说，我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。全世界马克思列宁主义力量日益壮大，各国人民的革命觉悟空前提高。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民反帝、反殖革命武装斗争不断发展。美帝国主义脚下的火山，正在迸发。以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义集团更加分崩离析。我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“全世界人民更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻！可以肯定，殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃，世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的彻底翻身，已经为期不远了。”
    黄永胜同志说，我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的我国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性的胜利。我们一定高举马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    黄永胜同志说，中阿两党、两国人民和两国军队，是最亲密的同志和战友。我们的斗争目标是一致的。我们的心是紧紧地连在一起的。我们之间的伟大友谊和战斗团结，是建立在无产阶级国际主义原则基础上的，是在反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义和反对各国反动派的伟大斗争中经过千锤百炼的。“不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”
