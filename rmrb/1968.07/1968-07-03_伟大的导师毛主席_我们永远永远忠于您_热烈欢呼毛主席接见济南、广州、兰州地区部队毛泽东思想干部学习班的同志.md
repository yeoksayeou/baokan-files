“Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!”

“Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!”

Warmly acclaim! Sing with joy! Millions of hearts are beating fiercely, millions of smiling faces welcome the reddest sun in our hearts!

Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, with a radiant face and a vigorous spirit, strides confidently forward, and with his close comrade-in-arms, our beloved Vice Chairman Lin, walks among us!

On the afternoon of June 30, 1968, this is an unforgettable moment, the happiest moment! With tears of excitement, we wave the red “Quotations from Chairman Mao” and shout to our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, thousands and thousands of times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!

Most beloved Chairman Mao! Your health is extremely good, and your energy is extremely abundant, this is the greatest happiness for the people of the entire nation and the revolutionary people of the whole world! We, who have grown up under the nurturing of your brilliant thoughts, represent the broad masses of soldiers and officers, and from the bottom of our hearts wish you eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

Most beloved Chairman Mao! Just as the hundreds of millions of soldiers and people of the entire nation are vigorously advancing towards the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and joyfully welcoming the 47th anniversary of the glorious, correct, and great Communist Party of China, you receive us. This is a brilliant chapter in the history of our Party and our army, the greatest care, encouragement, inspiration, and education for the soldiers and people of the entire nation. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The sea is deep,

But not as deep as our proletarian feelings for you.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We soldiers, who are loyal to you without limit, fighting on the front lines of the South China Sea, the Yellow Sea, and the northwestern plateau, think of you day and night. Every time we think of you, think of your great revolutionary practice, we gain boundless wisdom and strength. The gunshots of the Autumn Harvest Uprising, the red flag of Jinggangshan, the lamplight in the caves of Yan'an, the lamplight in Zhongnanhai, forever inspire us to advance bravely along the revolutionary path you have opened!

Old Red Army soldier He Jun, who is working in the countryside in Nanniwan and was a classmate of Zhang Zide, had worked by your side for many years. When he heard that he was going to study by your side, he rode his bicycle over mountains and valleys, covering more than a hundred miles in one breath, and arrived on time for the train to Beijing. Today, He Jun and Wang Ziyun, the political commissar of the unit where the good cadre loyal to your revolutionary line, Meng He, served, the political commissar Xu Chongbo of the unit where the heroic soldier Liu Xuebao served, and the political commissar Lei Yujun of the unit where the heroic soldier Pang Guoxing served, see that you are in extremely good health, and feel infinite happiness. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We, who guard the banks of the Yanhe River, the shores of Qinghai Lake, inside and outside the Great Wall, and north and south of the Liu Pan Mountains, miss you deeply. We miss the days and nights you led the people of the entire nation to fight in the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an. Your volumes of brilliant writings in Yan'an are forever our guiding principles for all work; the revolutionary spirit you cultivated in Yan'an forever inspires us to advance victoriously; your great teachings to distinguish between “revolution or counter-revolution” and “Yan'an or Xi'an” are forever our guiding lights to unite the broad masses and strike down a handful of class enemies. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! With our profound proletarian feelings for you, we sincerely wish you eternal life! Eternal life!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The soldiers guarding the southern gate of our motherland miss you deeply. In March 1949, the old soldiers of the Taishan Heroic Regiment, who accepted your inspection in Beijing, are back by your side today. Nineteen years ago, the scene of you waving your hand to inspect us is always before our eyes. Your great call to “carry the revolution through to the end” is forever etched in our hearts. Thinking of you, crossing the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, thousands of difficulties and obstacles cannot stop us; thinking of you, fighting at Hengbao, pursuing the fleeing enemy, quickly liberating the border areas of Guangdong and Guangxi; thinking of you, guarding the South China Sea for nineteen years, our fighting will is firmer than steel.

A unit in the Wuzhi Mountain area gathered the cadres going to Beijing to study, facing the city of Beijing and the red sun, solemnly announced the great news of coming to study by your side. Everyone was excited and shouted warmly: “Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!” The shout echoed through the valleys and resonated through the coconut groves. On their way, day and night, they sewed with tears, stitch by stitch, on a bright red flag, the soldiers' oath of loyalty to you: “The soldiers of Wuzhi Mountain, day and night looking towards Beijing, by the side of the supreme commander, we swear, step by step, forever loyal.” They arrived in Beijing at midnight, got off the train, and lined up at Tiananmen Square, standing in front of your statue, reporting to you. With tears of excitement, they sang “The East Is Red” loudly, wishing you eternal life! Eternal life! This resounding song expresses the soldiers' boundless affection for you; this sincere wish expresses the soldiers' boundless loyalty to you.

Old Red Army soldier and Chairman of the Guangzhou Revolutionary Committee Huang Ronghai was hospitalized and did not receive the notice to go to Beijing to study. He was so anxious that he couldn't sleep all night. The decades of revolutionary struggle following Chairman Mao closely surged before his eyes. Huang Ronghai repeatedly pleaded to go to Beijing, and after getting permission, he couldn't help but shed tears of happiness. Before he even stepped out of the hospital gate, his heart had already flown to Chairman Mao's side. Today, he stands in front of the great supreme commander Chairman Mao, tightly grasping Chairman Mao's giant hand, a warm current instantly surged through his body, and the feelings he had missed Chairman Mao for more than ten years all burst out. He shouted emotionally: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The soldiers fighting on the shores of the Yellow Sea, north and south of Mount Tai, and on both banks of the Stony River miss you deeply! Political Commissar Li Huaili of the unit where the communist warrior Wang Jie, who dedicated his life to the revolution, served, Political Commissar Zhang Dexing of the unit where the heroic soldier Lü Xiangbi, who sacrificed himself to save the Red Guards, served, and Logistics Director Sun Leyi, an active learner and practitioner of Mao Zedong Thought, brought the deep loyalty of the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the Jinan Military Region to Chairman Mao. Sun Leyi, this young cadre who grew up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, regards being completely and thoroughly loyal to Chairman Mao as the soul of serving the people wholeheartedly. Many comrades entrusted him, seeing the beloved great leader Chairman Mao, to shout “Long live Chairman Mao” many times. Today, he stands in front of Chairman Mao and shouts enthusiastically: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years to Chairman Mao! He swears: To always use the “two rulers” of “completely” and “thoroughly,” and the “two mirrors” of “extreme responsibility to work” and “extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people,” to measure and examine his loyalty to Chairman Mao, let the word “loyalty” permeate his soul, command his life, and direct his actions.

The loudest song is “The East Is Red,” and the greatest leader is Mao Zedong. Several dozen old Red Army soldiers from the Jinan Military Region, over fifty years old, formed an old Red Army chorus on the train to Beijing, singing “The East Is Red” and “The Boat Sails on the Sea with the Helmsman” along the way. The more they sang, the more excited they became, the more they sang, the younger they felt, wanting to sing this song of praise to Chairman Mao. Old Red Army soldier Li Shuqian had once listened to the affectionate teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao at the “Anti-Japanese Military and Political University” when Lin Vice Chairman was the principal. Today, he came to the Mao Zedong Thought Study Class, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and saw the Chairman Mao he had missed day and night. He said excitedly: “This is my second time entering the ‘Anti-Japanese Military and Political University.’ I will forever follow the brilliant path indicated by Chairman Mao.”

In this happiest moment, the cadres from the naval units on the coastal defense frontline are overjoyed. Their hearts are surging like the sea. Political Commissar Liu Weihan and Deputy Political Commissar Wang Ruichang of a certain unit that won honors in the “8·6” naval battle, Deputy Squadron Leader Ye Jianquan of the unit where the “Pioneer Boat on the Sea” and the heroic soldier Mai Xiande served, today came to the side of the red sun. Beloved Chairman Mao! We naval soldiers miss you day and night. We stand on the coastal defense frontline, just like standing in front of Tiananmen Square, guarding by your side. Although we are far from Beijing, separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, the hearts of the naval soldiers are tightly connected with you. Your great and brilliant image is forever engraved in our hearts, and your latest instructions are always in our ears. “The boat sails on the sea with the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.” Your brilliant thoughts point out the direction of victory for us. In every naval battle, we hoist high the great red flag of your brilliant thoughts, overcome great winds and waves, defeat all enemies, and sink the daring enemy ships into the sea one after another. Beloved Chairman Mao! We naval soldiers are forever loyal to you, even if the sea dries up and the stones crumble, our hearts will never change. We will dedicate our hearts to the people and guard the coastal frontiers to fight the enemy! Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Steel is hard,

But not as hard as our will to implement your latest instructions.

The lights of the Great Hall of the People are brilliant and magnificent; Chairman Mao's brilliance warms our hearts; the revolutionary soldiers are infinitely loyal to you, and every red heart faces the red sun. Chairman Mao waves his giant hand, guiding us to advance bravely. Beloved Chairman Mao! You have always taught us to distinguish between friends and enemies and to protect the broad masses of the people. Recently, you have wisely pointed out: “Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship.” We are infinitely loyal to you and closely follow your latest instructions. No matter how the wind blows and the waves beat, even if the sky falls and the earth crumbles, our determination to implement your latest instructions is firmer than steel. Political Commissar Wu Yaoguang of a certain unit went to Guangzhou to support the left in 1967 and first came to the peasant movement training institute you held more than forty years ago, studying the brilliant work you wrote there, “Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society.” Beloved Chairman Mao! Your great teaching on “who are our enemies and who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution” is our strongest ideological weapon in distinguishing between friends and enemies, protecting the people, and striking down the enemy in supporting the left. Over the past year, we have followed your teachings, smashed the various plots of the class enemy to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and protected the broad masses of the people. We deeply understand that using your latest instructions to propagate and arm the masses, organizing a vast revolutionary army, and fiercely striking down a handful of class enemies is the greatest protection for the broad masses of the people. We inherit your revolutionary tradition of establishing the peasant movement training institute, deeply enter the masses, and hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, quickly spreading your series of latest instructions to every household. Beloved Chairman Mao! The sky is vast, the earth is vast, but nothing is as powerful as your latest instructions. When a handful of class enemies direct their spears at the newly born revolutionary committees and the revolutionary masses, we, together with the broad revolutionary masses, use your latest instructions to launch the most powerful counterattack, defending the newly born revolutionary committees and your proletarian revolutionary line.

In the Jinggangshan area, executing the task of supporting the left, the commander of a certain regiment, the heroic soldier Li Peijiang, looks up at the great supreme commander Chairman Mao, and his heart surges with hot tears. He represents the entire regiment of soldiers and officers, declaring his determination and loyalty to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Last July, our unit came to Jinggangshan to support the left. As soon as we entered this revolutionary mountain and stepped on this revolutionary path, your great revolutionary practice in Jinggangshan educated, inspired, and encouraged us, becoming a powerful force for us to implement your latest instructions. “Determine to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory.” We studied your brilliant work “A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire” in Daping, dared to face the headwind and fight the waves, and firmly supported the proletarian revolutionary faction; we ate the plain stir-fried pumpkin and red rice that you ate, carried forward the glorious tradition of hard struggle, closely united with the masses, shared weal and woe, and fought shoulder to shoulder; we stood on the Huangyang Ridge, reciting your magnificent lines: “The cannon roars on the Huangyang Ridge, reporting the enemy's night retreat,” carried forward the spirit of relentless pursuit and attack, mobilized the broad masses to launch a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, dug out the remnants of the Kuomintang hidden for more than a decade, and drowned a handful of class enemies in the vast ocean of “people's war.”

Chairman Mao comes to us and smiles affectionately. Beloved Chairman Mao! You believe in the masses the most, care for the masses the most, and support the masses' revolutionary movement the most, forever united with the revolutionary masses. Political Commissar Fei Longshan of a certain unit of the Lanzhou Military Region, today sees Chairman Mao for the fifth time. His heart surges with unbounded excitement, saying: Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We will forever be with the masses, resolutely implement your latest instructions, which is the greatest care for the broad masses of the people and the greatest loyalty to you. In the “three supports and two militaries” work, we follow your great teachings of “believing in and relying on the masses” and “carrying out heart-to-heart talks, this method is very good,” deeply entering the masses, widely carrying out heart-to-heart talks, propagating and implementing your series of latest instructions, promoting the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination of revolution. Everyone happily says: “Chairman Mao's instructions are close to our hearts, military and civilians help each other to talk from the heart, talking makes the sun rise in our hearts, talking makes our red hearts closely connected, the more we talk, the more loyal we are to Chairman Mao, forever following Chairman Mao to make revolution.”

Chairman Mao waves his hand and comes over, and the sunflowers bloom facing the sun, following Chairman Mao to make revolution, completely and thoroughly for the people. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a certain unit of the Jinan Military Region has established new merits for the people. In the “three supports and two militaries” work, all actions are under the command of the great supreme commander Chairman Mao, firmly standing on the side of the broad revolutionary masses, protecting the broad masses. The responsible comrades of this unit, Qi Wei and Wang Jinquan, reviewed the course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, excitedly saying: Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is you who guided us from one victory to another. Your revolutionary line is a thorough mass line. We will forever be loyal to you, loyal to your brilliant thoughts, loyal to your revolutionary line, and swear to achieve the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The universe is vast,

But not as vast as our determination to forever make revolution with you.

Chairman Mao looks at us with concern, placing unlimited hopes in us!

Chairman Mao waves his giant hand, guiding us to win new and greater victories!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Looking at the place where the red sun rises today, the waves of Dongting Lake surge to the sky, and the sunrise fills the country of lotuses. Old Red Army soldier Liu Shanjun of a certain unit stationed in Hunan comes to your side, accepts your inspection, and receives your battle orders, how can he not be surging with emotions and soaring with ambition. He shouts “Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!” a thousand times, and wishes you eternal life! Eternal life! Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Seeing you, a red sun rises in my heart; seeing you, the determination to carry the revolution through to the end is unshaken! In February of this year, a handful of capitalist roaders in a certain coal mine colluded with untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists from society, inciting the masses to fight the masses, plotting to sabotage the revolution and production. In the past, your great image of leading the people to make revolution, wearing straw shoes and holding an umbrella, traversing the three Xiang and four Yue regions, gave Liu Shanjun boundless strength. He braved the severe winter snow and came to this coal mine, diving into the masses, propagating your latest instructions issued during your inspection of North China, Central China, and East China. The broad revolutionary workers heard your affectionate voice, the fog disappeared, and they quickly achieved a great alliance of revolution, exposed the hidden class enemies, and the revolutionary situation was excellent, with production rising steadily. On the joyous day of the establishment of the Hunan Revolutionary Committee, you again issued your latest instructions to the soldiers and people of the entire nation: “The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party and its leadership and the broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.” Liu Shanjun, this old soldier who participated in the Battle of Pingxingguan, looking up at Beijing, touching the four bullet fragments left on his body by Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, said excitedly: Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your teachings have brightened my eyes, if we do not carry this political revolution through to the end, a handful of class enemies will restore capitalism, and the heads of thousands and thousands of people will fall to the ground. Today, Liu Shanjun, in this joyous ocean, facing the great leader Chairman Mao, appears vigorous and especially young. He shouts emotionally: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years to Chairman Mao! He is determined to forever maintain revolutionary youth, closely unite with the revolutionary masses, and swear to fight to the end with China's Khrushchev and all class enemies!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which you personally ignited, burns across thousands of mountains and rivers. Today, the land of our motherland is especially magnificent. At this happiest moment when you receive us, Wang Lin, the commander of a certain unit from the foot of the Liu Pan Mountains, how can he forget the brilliant poems you wrote during the world-renowned Long March, “The Liu Pan Mountains”? Wang Lin and the entire regiment of soldiers and officers, in supporting the left, every time they encounter difficulties, look up at the majestic peaks of the Liu Pan Mountains, face the Beijing city they yearn for day and night, and loudly recite your magnificent lines: “Not reaching the Great Wall is not a hero.” Your spirit of fearlessly advancing, leading the Red Army to conquer evil and bind the dragon, in the past, has added boundless strength to them. They, together with the broad revolutionary masses, in the great winds and waves of class struggle, fight hard battles and fierce battles with the enemy, binding all the big and small “dragons.” Today, Wang Lin sees the reddest sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, fulfilling his lifelong most ardent wish, and says with boundless excitement: We will forever carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution of “not reaching the Great Wall is not a hero,” keeping our eyes firmly on the enemy, launching continuous and fierce attacks on the class enemies, and achieving the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The deputy commander of a certain unit of the Air Force, the former commander of the heroic aviation squadron, Bi Xuhai, and the commander of a certain flight squadron, Zhang Wende, who was awarded a collective second-class merit, come to Chairman Mao's side, with surging emotions and tears of joy, and a thousand words surge in their hearts. Beloved Chairman Mao! In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by you, we air force soldiers, with our boundlessly loyal hearts to you, vigilantly guard the airspace of our motherland. “In our hearts, there is a red sun, piercing through the clouds and fog without losing our way; in our hearts, there is a red sun, swearing to liberate all of humanity.” Bi Xuhai said with boundless passion: Beloved Chairman Mao! We firmly remember your teachings of “spare no effort to annihilate the invading enemy” and, together with our brother units, have many times shot down and damaged the invading American bandits. We follow your teachings of “never forget class struggle” and, in the sky, fiercely beat the American paper tiger, and on the ground, fiercely criticize China's Khrushchev. The more we criticize, the more we hate China's Khrushchev, and the more we love you. Your receiving us is the greatest encouragement and education for us. We will definitely take your reception as a great driving force for “grasping revolution, promoting production, work, and preparedness,” hoisting high the great red flag of your brilliant thoughts, maintaining high vigilance against all class enemies at home and abroad, and swearing to defend you, defend the broad masses of the people, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and continuously establish new merits for the people!

Mao Zedong Thought cultivates heroes, and heroes have a sun in their hearts. The heroic soldiers Yang Yucai, Yu Fuxiang, Zhang Chunli, Liu Xingsheng, Li Wanyu, Wang Pingdong, and Zhang Xichun, happily come to Chairman Mao's side, once again bathing in the brilliance of the red sun. At this happy moment, Yu Fuxiang and Zhang Chunli recall the unforgettable scene seventeen years ago at the National Conference of Heroes and Labor Models, where they saw Chairman Mao: When they presented the flag to Chairman Mao, they looked up at Chairman Mao's benevolent face and shed tears of happiness. For seventeen years, Chairman Mao's teachings at the heroes' conference are forever engraved in the hearts of the heroes. Heroic soldier Yang Yucai, in the battle to raid the White Tiger Regiment during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, thirteen people in thirteen minutes, smashed the regimental headquarters of the White Tiger Regiment and pulled down the regimental flag of the White Tiger Regiment. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Yang Yucai took on the task of supporting the left, and the living facts of class struggle educated him. He said: After eliminating the enemies who carry guns, if we do not eliminate the hidden capitalist roaders, traitors, and spies who do not carry guns, we cannot protect the socialist mountains and rivers. In supporting the left, Yang Yucai, together with the broad revolutionary masses, brandished the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, with the heroic spirit of raiding the White Tiger Regiment, launched a fierce attack on the class enemies, and established new merits for the people. On the glorious day of the 47th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, Yang Yucai solemnly declares to Chairman Mao: Beloved Chairman Mao! You teach us: “The Party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be able to lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses to fight against the class enemies, a vigorous vanguard organization.” In the past, under your command, in the battles to annihilate the Kuomintang bandits and defeat the American wolves, the Communist Party members played a vanguard and exemplary role. Today, on the battlefield of continuing the struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries under your personal command, we Communist Party members will definitely be at the forefront, never stopping, closely uniting with the masses, leading the broad masses, and sweeping away all class enemies, letting the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high forever!

June 30 is such a happy and unforgettable day! We were received by the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, fulfilling our greatest wish in life, which is our greatest honor and happiness. We shout! We sing!

Most beloved Chairman Mao! The sky is vast, the earth is vast, but not as vast as your kindness to us, father and mother are not as dear as you.

Most beloved Chairman Mao! A thousand songs, how can they sing out the soldiers' boundless love for you; the most beautiful language, also cannot express the soldiers' boundless loyalty to you!

Most beloved Chairman Mao! The great news of your receiving us is like a vast east wind, crossing mountains and seas, crossing forests and oceans, spreading to the front lines of the South China Sea, the shores of the Yellow Sea, the northwestern plateau, and spreading to all corners of our motherland. This great news warms the hearts of the revolutionary soldiers; this great news forever calls us to march towards victory!

Most beloved Chairman Mao! The sky connects with the water, and the water connects with the sky, the red hearts of the revolutionary soldiers are forever connected with you!

Thinking of you, the soldiers' hearts are infinitely warm!

Thinking of you, there are no obstacles on the road ahead!

Thinking of you, the will to carry the revolution through to the end is firm!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The revolutionary soldiers who are infinitely loyal to you swear to you: Forever take Vice Chairman Lin as a brilliant example, read your books for a lifetime, listen to your words for a lifetime, walk the revolutionary path you indicate for a lifetime, and swear to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! Swear to carry the Chinese revolution and the world revolution through to the end!

“Sweep away all harmful insects, no enemies!”

    一九六八年六月三十日下午，这是终生难忘的时刻，这是最最幸福的时刻！我们含着激动的泪花，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，向着我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，千遍万遍地欢呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    最最敬爱的毛主席啊！您老人家身体非常非常健康，精力非常非常充沛，这是全国人民和全世界革命人民最大最大的幸福！我们这些在您的光辉思想哺育下成长起来的革命战士，代表广大指战员，最最衷心地祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    最最敬爱的毛主席啊！正当全国亿万军民在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的征途中，生气勃勃地迎接伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党成立四十七周年的时候，您老人家接见我们，这是我党我军历史上的光辉篇章，这是对全国军民的最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大鞭策，最大教育。毛主席啊，毛主席！大海再深，
    比不上我们对您的无产阶级感情深
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们战斗在南海前哨、黄海之滨、西北高原的无限忠于您的战士，日日夜夜想念您。每当想到您，想到您的伟大革命实践，就有了无穷的智慧和力量。秋收起义的枪声，井冈山的红旗，延安窑洞的灯火，中南海的灯光，永远激励着我们沿着您老人家开辟的革命航道奋勇向前！
    正在南泥湾支农的红军老战士、张思德的同班战友何钧，曾经多年在您老人家身边工作，听说要来您身边学习，他骑上自行车翻山越岭，一口气飞驰一百多里，按时赶上开往北京的火车。今天，何钧和无限忠于您的革命路线的好干部门合生前所在部队政委王子云，英雄战士刘学保所在部队政委许冲波，战斗英雄庞国兴生前所在部队政委雷岳俊，看到您老人家身体非常非常健康，感到无限幸福。毛主席啊，毛主席！我们，守卫在延河之滨、青海湖畔、玉门关内外、六盘山南北的战士，无限怀念您，怀念您在革命圣地延安率领全国军民战斗过的日日夜夜。您在延安写下的卷卷雄文，永远是我们一切工作的指导方针；您培育的延安革命精神，永远激励我们胜利向前；您的要分清“是革命还是反革命”、“是延安还是西安”的伟大教导，永远是我们团结广大群众、打击一小撮阶级敌人的指路明灯。毛主席啊，毛主席！我们怀着对您无限深厚的无产阶级感情，最衷心地祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！守卫祖国南大门的战士多么想念您。一九四九年三月，在北京接受您检阅的塔山英雄团的老战士们，今天又回到了您的身边。十九年前，您挥着巨手检阅我们的情景，时时展现在我们眼前。您“将革命进行到底”的伟大号召，永远牢记在我们心间。想起您，过黄河，跨长江，千难万险无阻挡；想起您，战衡宝，追穷寇，迅速解放粤桂边；想起您，守卫南海十九年，战斗意志比钢坚。
    五指山区某部队，把上北京学习的干部集合在山上，面向北京城，心向红太阳，庄严地宣布到您老人家身边来学习的特大喜讯，大家激动得热烈欢呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”这欢呼声震撼山谷，响遍椰林。他们在日夜兼程的途中，个个含着热泪，一针针，一线线，在鲜艳的红旗上，绣下了战士无限忠于您的誓言：“五指山下子弟兵，日日夜夜望北京，统帅身边立誓言，步步紧跟永远忠。”他们到北京正是深夜，下了车，就列队来到天安门，站在您老人家像前，向您老人家报到。他们含着激动的泪花，放声高唱《东方红》，敬祝您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！这响亮的歌声，唱出了革命战士对您的无限深情；这衷心的祝愿，表达了革命战士对您的无限忠诚。
    红军老战士、广州市革命委员会主任黄荣海，因病住院，没有接到上北京学习的通知。他急得彻夜不能入睡，几十年紧紧跟着毛主席闹革命的战斗历程，全都涌现在眼前。黄荣海多次恳求上北京，得到批准后，情不自禁地流下了幸福的泪水，脚还没有迈出医院的大门，心已飞到了毛主席的身边。今天，他站在伟大统帅毛主席的面前，紧紧地握着毛主席的巨手，一股暖流顿时灌注全身，十几年来怀念毛主席的感情，一下子都迸发出来，他纵情高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！战斗在黄海之滨、泰山南北、沂水两岸的战士无限想念您！一心为革命的共产主义战士王杰生前所在部队政委李怀礼，舍身抢救红卫兵的英雄战士吕祥璧生前所在部队政委张德兴，活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、某部后勤处长孙乐义，带来了济南部队广大指战员对毛主席的一片忠心。孙乐义，这个在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的年轻干部，把无限忠于毛主席，作为完全彻底为人民服务的灵魂。多少同志嘱咐他，见了敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，要多喊几声毛主席万岁。今天，他站在毛主席跟前，尽情地高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！他宣誓：要始终不渝地用“完全”“彻底”这“两把尺子”，用“对工作的极端的负责任”、“对同志对人民的极端的热忱”这“两面镜子”，衡量和检查自己对毛主席的忠诚，让“忠”字浸透灵魂，统帅生命，指挥行动。
    最响亮的歌是《东方红》，最伟大的领袖是毛泽东。济南部队几十名年过半百的红军老战士，在开往北京的列车上，组成了老红军合唱队，沿途高唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》。他们越唱越兴奋，越唱越年轻，要把这颂歌唱给毛主席听。老红军战士李书全，曾经在林副主席担任校长的“抗大”聆听过伟大领袖毛主席的亲切教导。今天，他来到毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席的最新指示，见到了日夜想念的毛主席，激动地说：“这是我第二次进‘抗大’，我要永远走毛主席指引的光辉道路。”
    在这最最幸福的时刻，来自海防前线的海军部队的干部们，欢乐的心啊，象大海一样奔腾。“八·六”海战中荣立战功的海军某部政委刘维焕、副政委王瑞昌，“海上先锋艇”和战斗英雄麦贤得所在部队的副大队长叶鉴泉，今天来到了红太阳的身边。敬爱的毛主席啊！我们海军战士日日夜夜想念您。我们站在海防前线，就象站在天安门前，守卫在您老人家身旁。我们和北京远隔万水千山，海军战士的心啊，和您老人家紧紧相连。您伟大的光辉形象，永远铭刻在我们心间，您的最新指示，时刻响在我们耳边。“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。您的光辉思想，给我们指出了胜利的航向。在历次海战中，我们高举您光辉思想的伟大红旗，战胜大风大浪，压倒一切敌人，将敢于来犯的敌舰，一次又一次地击沉海底。敬爱的毛主席啊，我们海军战士永远忠于您，海枯石烂不变心，掏尽红心为人民，坚守海疆杀敌人！毛主席啊，毛主席！钢铁再坚，
    比不上我们落实您最新指示的意志坚
    人民大会堂的灯火，灿烂辉煌，毛主席的光辉啊，暖心房；革命战士无限忠于您，颗颗红心向着红太阳。毛主席向我们亲切地频频招手，会场成了沸腾的海洋。
    在这红色的海洋里，我们伟大舵手毛主席挥动巨手，指引我们奋勇向前。敬爱的毛主席啊！您一贯教导我们，要分清敌我，保护广大人民群众。最近，您又英明地指出：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”我们对您无限地忠，对您的最新指示紧紧地跟。任凭风吹浪打，哪怕天塌地陷，我们落实您最新指示的决心啊，比钢铁还坚。某部政委吴耀光所在部队，去年进入广州支左，首先来到您老人家四十多年前举办的农民运动讲习所，学习您在这里写下的光辉著作《中国社会各阶级的分析》。敬爱的毛主席啊！您关于“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题”的伟大教导，是我们在支左中分清敌我，保护人民，打击敌人最强大的思想武器。一年多来，我们遵循着您的教导，粉碎了阶级敌人妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命的种种阴谋，保护了广大人民群众。我们深深地认识到，用您的最新指示宣传群众，武装群众，组织浩浩荡荡的革命大军，狠狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，就是对广大人民群众最大的保护。我们继承您当年开办农民运动讲习所的革命传统，深入群众，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，把您的一系列最新指示最迅速地传播到千家万户。敬爱的毛主席啊！天大地大，没有您的最新指示威力大。当一小撮阶级敌人把矛头指向新生的革命委员会、指向革命群众的时候，我们和广大革命群众一起，用您的最新指示，进行了最有力的回击，捍卫了新生的革命委员会，捍卫了您的无产阶级革命路线。
    在井冈山地区执行支左任务的某团团长、战斗英雄李培江，仰望着伟大统帅毛主席，心潮滚滚热泪流。他代表全团指战员，向毛主席表决心，献忠心。毛主席啊，毛主席！去年七月，我们部队来到井冈山支左，一走进这革命的山，一踏上这革命的路，您老人家当年在井冈山的伟大革命实践，教育着我们，激励着我们，鼓舞着我们，成为我们落实您的最新指示的强大动力，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”。我们在大井，学习了您在这里写下的光辉著作《星星之火，可以燎原》，敢于顶逆风，战恶浪，坚决支持了无产阶级革命派；我们吃着您当年吃过的淡炒南瓜红米饭，发扬艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，紧密地和群众联系在一起，同甘共苦，并肩战斗；我们站在黄洋界上，朗读着您气势磅礴的诗句：“黄洋界上炮声隆，报道敌军宵遁”，发扬穷追猛打的战斗精神，发动广大群众向一小撮阶级敌人展开猛烈的进攻，挖出了隐藏十几年的国民党残渣余孽，把一小撮阶级敌人淹没在“人民战争”的汪洋大海之中。
    毛主席来到我们中间，亲切地向我们微笑。敬爱的毛主席啊！您最相信群众，最关心群众，最支持群众的革命运动，永远和革命群众心连心。兰州部队某部政委费龙山，今天第五次见到了毛主席。他心如潮涌，无比激动地说：毛主席啊，毛主席！我们永远和群众在一起，坚决落实您老人家的最新指示，就是对广大人民群众最大的爱护，就是对您最大的忠诚。我们在“三支”“两军”工作中，遵照您老人家“要相信和依靠群众”，“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的伟大教导，深入到群众中去，广泛开展谈心活动，宣传、落实您老人家的一系列最新指示，促进了革命的大联合、革命的三结合。大家高兴地说：“毛主席指示照心坎，军民互助把心谈，谈得心中太阳升，谈得红心紧相连，越谈越对毛主席忠，永跟毛主席干革命。”
    毛主席挥手走过来，朵朵葵花向阳开，跟着毛主席闹革命，完全彻底为人民。在无产阶级文化大革命中为人民立了新功的济南部队某部，在“三支”“两军”中，一切行动听从伟大统帅毛主席的指挥，坚定不移地站在广大革命群众一边，保护广大群众。这个部队的负责同志齐威、王金泉回顾了无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，激动地说：毛主席啊，毛主席！在无产阶级文化大革命中，是您，指引着我们从一个胜利走向又一个胜利。您老人家的革命路线是彻底的群众路线。我们要永远忠于您，忠于您的光辉思想，忠于您的革命路线，誓夺无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！毛主席啊，毛主席！宇宙再大，
    比不上我们跟您永远干革命的决心大
    毛主席关切地看着我们，把无限的希望寄托在我们身上！
    毛主席向我们挥巨手，指引我们去夺取新的更伟大的胜利！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！看今日红太阳升起的地方，洞庭波涌连天雪，芙蓉国里尽朝晖。驻湖南某部的红军老战士刘善福，来到您的身边，接受您的检阅，领受您的战斗号令，怎不叫他心潮滚滚，壮志凌云。他千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他千遍万遍地敬祝您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！毛主席啊，毛主席！见到您，一轮红日从心中升起；见到您，革命到底志不移！今年二月，某煤矿一小撮走资派勾结社会上没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，挑动群众斗群众，阴谋破坏革命和生产。当年，您老人家脚穿草鞋，手拿雨伞，踏遍三湘四水，发动和领导人民闹革命的伟大形象，给了刘善福无穷无尽的力量。他冒着严冬大雪，来到这个煤矿，一头扎到群众中间，宣传您视察华北、中南、华东地区时发出的最新指示。广大革命职工听到您的亲切声音，迷雾全消，迅速地实现了革命大联合，揪出了隐藏的阶级敌人，革命形势大好，生产节节上升。在湖南省革命委员会成立的大喜日子里，您老人家又一次向全国军民发出了最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”。刘善福，这个参加过平型关大战的老战士，仰望着北京，手摸着日本帝国主义和国民党反动派在他身上留下的四块弹片，激动地说：毛主席啊，毛主席！您的教导擦亮了我的眼睛，不把这场政治大革命进行到底，一小撮阶级敌人就要复辟资本主义，千百万人头就要落地。今天，刘善福在这欢腾的海洋里，面对着伟大领袖毛主席，显得朝气蓬勃，格外年轻。他纵情欢呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！他决心永葆革命青春，和革命群众紧密地联系在一起，誓与中国赫鲁晓夫和一切阶级敌人战斗到底！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家亲自点燃的无产阶级文化大革命的烈火，燃遍千山万水。今天，祖国的大地，格外壮丽。在您接见我们这最最幸福的时刻，来自六盘山麓的某部团长王林，怎能忘记您在举世闻名的长征途中写下的光辉诗篇《六盘山》。王林和全团指战员在支左中，每当遇到困难的时候，便仰望着雄伟的六盘山峰，面向着日夜向往的北京城，高声朗诵着您老人家“不到长城非好汉”的豪迈诗句，您当年率领红军征腐恶、缚苍龙的一往无前的革命精神，给他们增添了无穷力量。他们和广大革命群众一道，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中和敌人打硬仗、打恶仗，缚住了大大小小的“苍龙”。今天，王林见到了我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，实现了终生最最热切的心愿，他万分激动地说：我们要永远发扬“不到长城非好汉”的彻底革命精神，眼睛里紧紧地盯住敌人，向阶级敌人发动持续的猛烈的进攻，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
      空军某部副部队长、航空兵英雄中队前中队长毕序海，荣立集体二等功的某飞行大队大队长张文德，来到毛主席身边，心潮滚滚喜泪流，千言万语涌心头。敬爱的毛主席啊，在您亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们空军战士怀着无限忠于您的一颗红心，警惕地守卫着祖国的领空。“心中有个红太阳，穿云破雾不迷航，心中有个红太阳，誓把人类全解放。”毕序海满怀激情地说：敬爱的毛主席啊！我们牢记您老人家“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌”的教导，和兄弟部队一起，多次击落击伤来犯的美国飞贼。我们遵照您老人家“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，上天痛打美帝纸老虎，下地狠批中国赫鲁晓夫。越批，我们对中国赫鲁晓夫越恨，对您老人家越亲。您接见我们，是对我们最大的鼓舞和教育，我们一定把您老人家的接见，作为“抓革命、促生产、促工作、促战备”的巨大动力，高举您的光辉思想的伟大红旗，对国内外一切阶级敌人，时刻保持高度的革命警惕，誓死保卫您，保卫广大人民群众，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，不断为人民立新功！
    毛泽东思想育英雄，英雄胸中有朝阳。战斗英雄杨育才、于复祥、张春礼、刘兴胜、李万余、王平东、张希春，幸福地来到毛主席跟前，又一次沐浴着红太阳的光辉。在这幸福的时刻，于复祥和张春礼回想起十七年前在全国战斗英雄和劳动模范代表会议上，见到毛主席的永生难忘的情景：他们向毛主席献旗时，仰望着毛主席慈祥的面容，流着幸福的热泪。十七年来，毛主席在英模会上的教导，每句话，每个字，都铭刻在英雄们的心坎上。战斗英雄杨育才，在抗美援朝奇袭白虎团的战斗中，十三个人，十三分钟，敲掉了白虎团的团部，拔掉了白虎团的团旗。无产阶级文化大革命中，杨育才担负了支左任务，活生生的阶级斗争事实教育了他。他说：消灭了拿枪的敌人，不消灭暗藏的走资派、叛徒、特务这些不拿枪的敌人，社会主义江山就保不住。在支左中，杨育才和广大革命群众一起，奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，以奇袭白虎团的英雄气概，展开了对阶级敌人的猛烈进攻，为人民立下了新功。在中国共产党成立四十七周年的光辉日子里，杨育才向毛主席庄严宣誓：敬爱的毛主席啊！您教导我们：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”过去，我们在您的统帅下，在消灭蒋匪军，打败美国狼的战斗中，共产党员起了先锋作用和模范作用。今天，在您亲自指挥的向国民党反动派继续斗争的战场上，我们共产党员一定冲锋在前，永不停顿，密切联系群众，带领广大群众，把一切阶级敌人统统扫除干净，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗高高飘扬！永远飘扬！
    六月三十日，是一个多么幸福、难忘的日子啊！我们受到了伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席的接见，实现了平生最大的愿望，这是我们无尚的光荣，最大的幸福。我们欢呼！我们歌唱！
    最最敬爱的毛主席啊！天大地大不如您老人家的恩情大，爹亲娘亲没有您老人家亲。
    最最敬爱的毛主席啊！千万支歌儿，哪能唱尽革命战士对您老人家的无限热爱；最美好的语言，也表达不了革命战士对您老人家的无限忠诚！
    最最敬爱的毛主席啊！您老人家接见我们的特大喜讯，象浩荡的东风，越过崇山峻岭，跨过森林海洋，传遍了南海前哨、黄海之滨、西北高原，传遍了祖国的四面八方。这特大的喜讯，温暖着革命战士的心房；这特大的喜讯，永远召唤着我们奔向胜利的前方！
    最最敬爱的毛主席啊！天连水，水连天，革命战士的颗颗红心啊，永远和您老人家紧相连！
    想着您，战士心里无限暖！
    想着您，前进路上无阻拦！
    想着您，革命到底意志坚！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！无限忠于您的革命战士向您宣誓：永远以林副主席为光辉榜样，一辈子读您的书，一辈子听您的话，一辈子走您老人家指引的革命路，誓将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！誓将中国革命和世界革命进行到底！
    “要扫除一切害人虫，全无敌”！
