The editorial "Carrying Forward the Party's Style of Close Ties with the Masses" published in *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *Liberation Army Daily* states: "Revolutionary masses should cherish the newly established revolutionary committees. Revolutionary committees should proactively accept criticism and supervision from the revolutionary masses." This is the only correct principle taught by the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin for handling the relationship between revolutionary committees and revolutionary masses.

The people are the foundation of the proletarian dictatorship and the source of its power. The revolutionary committees born out of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can only become revolutionary, authoritative, and vigorous command centers with proletarian authority by maintaining the broadest, most frequent, and closest ties with the revolutionary masses, and by constantly and proactively accepting criticism and supervision from the revolutionary masses.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "To unleash initiative, it must be concretely manifested in the creative ability, sense of responsibility, active work, daring to and skillfully raising questions, expressing opinions, criticizing shortcomings, and the supervisory role from a protective standpoint towards the leading organs and leading cadres." He also said: "To concentrate from the masses and return to the masses to form correct leadership opinions is the fundamental leadership method." Revolutionary committees should follow Chairman Mao's teachings, consciously and broadly listen to the opinions of the revolutionary masses, and proactively accept criticism and supervision from the revolutionary masses. Only in this way can the unprecedented political enthusiasm of the broad masses in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution be raised to a new height.

However, not everyone has clearly seen the unprecedented surge in political enthusiasm among the people. Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." Suppressing the masses' criticism will inevitably stifle the revolutionary spirit of the masses, which is the style of the Kuomintang and all bourgeois parties and must be resolutely opposed.

    主动接受革命群众的批评和监督
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》社论《发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风》指出：“革命群众要爱护新生的革命委员会。革命委员会要主动地接受革命群众的批评和监督。”这是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部教导我们处理好革命委员会和革命群众的关系的唯一正确的原则。
    人民群众是无产阶级政权的基础，是无产阶级政权力量的源泉。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中诞生的革命委员会，只有同革命群众保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系，只有经常地、主动地接受革命群众的批评和监督，才能成为革命的、有无产阶级权威的、朝气蓬勃的战斗指挥部。
    毛主席指出：“所谓发挥积极性，必须具体地表现在领导机关、干部和党员的创造能力，负责精神，工作的活跃，敢于和善于提出问题、发表意见、批评缺点，以及对于领导机关和领导干部从爱护观点出发的监督作用。”又说：“从群众中集中起来又到群众中坚持下去，以形成正确的领导意见，这是基本的领导方法。”革命委员会应当遵照毛主席的这些教导，自觉地、广泛地听取革命群众的意见，主动地接受革命群众的批评和监督。只有这样，才能使广大群众在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的空前高涨的政治热情，提高到新的高度。
    但是，对于人民群众空前高涨的政治热情，并不是所有的人都清楚地看到了的。毛主席最近深刻地指出：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”压制群众的批评，必然会窒息群众的革命精神，这是国民党同一切资产阶级政党的作风，必须坚决反对。
