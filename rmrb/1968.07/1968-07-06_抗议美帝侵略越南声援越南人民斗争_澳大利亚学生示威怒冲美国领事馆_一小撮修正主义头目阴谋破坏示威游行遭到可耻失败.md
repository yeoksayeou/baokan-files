Students and workers in Melbourne and Sydney held demonstrations and marches on July 4 to protest against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam.

In Melbourne, hundreds of students and workers together held a demonstration outside the U.S. Consulate, carrying the flags of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. They clashed with police. When the demonstrators tried to storm the consulate, the authorities sent mounted police to charge at the students, but they were met with fierce resistance. Angry students smashed the consulate's windows with stones and tore down and burned the U.S. flag hanging from the consulate building. The demonstrators also shouted slogans at the Americans inside the consulate: "Get out of Vietnam!" "U.S. imperialists are filthy aggressors!" "Butchers!" "Hands off Australia!"

The young students showed great determination in their struggle with the police. Fifty-five students were illegally arrested. When the police took the students away in police cars, the demonstrators smashed the windows of four police cars and went to the police station to demand the release of the detainees.

Some revisionist leaders tried to sabotage the demonstration, attempting to calm the students down and disperse the crowd. However, their plot failed miserably.

After the demonstration at the police station, several hundred people, despite police repression, went to the Southern Cross Hotel, where some Americans were holding a meeting. The demonstrators rushed into the hotel, tore down the U.S. flag, and burned it in front of the building.

In Sydney, 300 students once again demonstrated outside the Federal Parliament offices to protest against the U.S. war in Vietnam and police brutality. A large number of police were sent to attack the demonstrators, but the demonstrators bravely fought back and did not retreat. They eventually stormed the Parliament offices building and held a sit-in demonstration.

    抗议美帝侵略越南声援越南人民斗争
    澳大利亚学生示威怒冲美国领事馆
    一小撮修正主义头目阴谋破坏示威游行遭到可耻失败
    据新华社墨尔本五日电　澳大利亚墨尔本和悉尼的学生，四日分别举行示威游行，反对美帝国主义侵略越南。
    在墨尔本，数百名学生和劳动人民一起，举着越南民主共和国国旗和越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜，在美国驻墨尔本领事馆外面举行示威，同警察进行了激烈的搏斗。示威者在向美国领事馆冲击时，统治当局派出了骑警向学生乱冲乱撞，但是遭到示威者的猛烈反击。愤怒的学生用石块砸碎了领事馆的玻璃窗，并把挂在领事馆屋顶上的一面美国星条旗扯下来烧毁。示威者还指着领事馆里的美国人高呼口号：“（美国）从越南滚出去！”“美帝国主义者是肮脏的侵略者！”“刽子手！”“不许干涉澳大利亚！”
    青年学生在同警察的搏斗中表现十分坚决。警察非法逮捕了五十五个学生。当警察用警车把学生带走时，示威者打碎了四辆警车的窗子，并前往警察局前示威，要求释放被捕者。
    一些修正主义的领导人企图破坏这次示威游行，他们极力想使学生“平静下来”，并妄图解散示威队伍。但是他们的阴谋遭到了可耻的失败。
    在警察局举行示威后，有几百人又不顾警察的镇压，来到萨瑟恩克罗斯旅馆，一些美国人正在那里举行集会活动。示威群众冲进旅馆，把美国星条旗扯下来，在大楼前烧毁。
    在悉尼，三百名学生再次在悉尼联邦议会办公处外面举行示威，抗议美国的侵越战争和警察的暴行。大批警察被派来袭击示威者，但示威者英勇反击，毫不退却，终于冲进了议会办公处大楼，举行了静坐示威。
