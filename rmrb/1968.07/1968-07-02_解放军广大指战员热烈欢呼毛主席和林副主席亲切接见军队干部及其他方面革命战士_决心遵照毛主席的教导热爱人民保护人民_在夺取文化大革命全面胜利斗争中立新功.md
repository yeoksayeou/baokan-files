On the eve of the 47th anniversary of the founding of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin warmly received comrades from the Mao Zedong Thought Cadres Study Classes of the PLA in the Jinan, Guangzhou, and Lanzhou regions, as well as other revolutionary fighters. This great piece of news has brought immense inspiration to the broad masses of PLA soldiers and officers. The soldiers and officers, filled with boundless excitement, pointed out that at a time when the entire nation is vigorously advancing towards the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and enthusiastically celebrating the 47th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin warmly received us revolutionary fighters. This is the greatest concern, greatest encouragement, greatest education, and greatest spur for the entire military and people. We must forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and in the great struggle for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, achieve new merits for the Party and the people.

From yesterday evening to tonight, the study sites of the Mao Zedong Thought Cadres Study Classes of the Jinan, Guangzhou, and Lanzhou regions, as well as the headquarters of various military branches and services of the PLA, have been immersed in an atmosphere of unprecedented festivity. Red flags are flying everywhere, firecrackers are exploding, and songs are resounding. Various units held grand meetings overnight to joyfully hail and celebrate the warm reception by our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin. When the comrades who were received reported to the crowd with boundless happiness that our red sun, Chairman Mao, is in excellent health, the entire venue immediately erupted in cheers. The soldiers and officers, with hearts full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, waved the red revolutionary classic "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and repeatedly shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!" They repeatedly sang "The East Is Red," "The Ship of the East Is Navigating," and "Wishing Chairman Mao a Long Life."

The military cadres who were received wrote down the happy moment of being received by the great leader Chairman Mao in their own copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Some sent telegrams or made phone calls to their units overnight to share the happiness and glory. They also gathered at oath-taking meetings and discussion meetings to express their resolutions. The great communist fighters Wang Jie, Ou Yanghai, and the good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, Meng He, as well as the heroes of battle Yang Yucai, Yu Fuxiang, Zhang Chunli, Liu Xingsheng, Li Wanyu, Wang Pindong, Zhang Xichun, Wang Tianbao, the former commander of the aviation regiment's heroic squadron Bi Xuhai, the political commissar Liu Weihuan and deputy political commissar Wang Ruichang of a certain unit in the August 6 naval battle who were awarded for their merits, and the active learner and applier of Mao Zedong Thought Sun Leyi, after being received by Chairman Mao, resolved to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought even more diligently, thoroughly transform their worldview, and forever be revolutionary fighters who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. They expressed that they must always remember the great leader Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," and with heightened revolutionary vigilance, fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line while alive and die for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Many old Red Army soldiers who have followed Chairman Mao in numerous campaigns over the decades were even more excited after being received by Chairman Mao. They repeatedly read Chairman Mao's teachings: "Do not rely on old merits, but achieve new ones!" They repeatedly studied the important editorials "Carry Forward the Party's Style of Close Ties with the Masses" from the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily. Fu Linbiao, an old Red Army soldier who joined in 1929 and saw the great leader Chairman Mao twice during the turbulent years of war, the department head of the medical department of a certain unit in the air force, Huang Ronghai, the old Red Army soldier and head of the Guangzhou Revolutionary Committee, and He Jun, the old Red Army soldier and classmate of Zhang Zide, all firmly expressed that they would follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, forever maintain close ties with the masses, never leave the masses, honestly be students of the masses, and wholeheartedly serve the people, forever preserving revolutionary youth. All comrades participating in the cadres study class of a certain unit solemnly swore in front of Chairman Mao's portrait at Tiananmen Square at dawn on July 1: "With Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

After the news reached the Jinan troops, the leadership held a midnight gathering of ten thousand people. The troops in Yantai, Xuzhou, and other places also held celebration meetings overnight. The broad masses of soldiers and officers expressed in countless words: "Wishing Chairman Mao a long life!" At the celebration meeting of the Jinan troops' leadership, the responsible comrade Fang Zheng said in his speech, "Chairman Mao's reception is a great joy in our military's political life. We must always remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of 'trust the masses, rely on the masses, respect the masses' initiative,' forever be students of the masses, and be close to the people's hearts. We will further do a good job of the 'three supports and two militaries' and achieve new merits for the people." In Qingdao, more than twenty thousand people from the naval troops and academies held a midnight celebration meeting. The soldiers and officers expressed that they must take the firm execution and brave defense of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as their lifelong sacred duty.

On this joyous day, three branches of the Guangzhou troops, the army, navy, and air force, held a celebration meeting of three thousand people. The responsible comrade Ding Sheng spoke at the meeting. He demanded that the troops' soldiers and officers better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, and push the ideological and organizational construction of the troops to a new stage. The soldiers and officers of many advanced units such as the Taishan Hero Regiment, the Steel Eighth Company on the front line of the South China Sea, and the vanguard boat on the sea, at their respective celebration meetings, swore to Chairman Mao: They are determined to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, stand guard, fight battles, and build the front line of the South China Sea into an iron wall defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The soldiers and officers of the "Steel Red Second Company" and the class where Ou Yanghai was, as well as the hero of battle Mai Xiande, firmly expressed that they must remember Chairman Mao's great teachings, love the people, protect the people, and be revolutionary fighters who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao.

After the news reached the Lanzhou region, more than ten thousand soldiers and officers of the Lanzhou troops held a midnight celebration meeting. Many troops stationed in Shaanxi and Qinghai held meetings and parades in the rain. The responsible comrade Du Shaoqi of the Lanzhou troops, the active learner of Chairman Mao's works Guo Xiaosi, the heroic soldier Liu Xuebao, and the soldiers and officers of the fifth company where Meng He was once the political instructor, at their respective oath-taking meetings, firmly expressed that they must take Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, like Meng He, always stand guard, stand watch, and fight battles for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.' We must follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, correctly treat the broad masses of the people, firmly protect the broad masses of the people, resolutely support the revolutionary masses, launch a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, and accurately and firmly strike a handful of class enemies. In the struggle to defend the newly born revolutionary committees and achieve the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will achieve new merits for the people."

The great news of Chairman Mao receiving military cadres spread throughout the army. The soldiers and officers of the entire army solemnly swore with boundless excitement: They must turn the great leader Chairman Mao's warm concern for revolutionary fighters into a great force, forever follow Chairman Mao to victory, and be loyal sentries of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!
