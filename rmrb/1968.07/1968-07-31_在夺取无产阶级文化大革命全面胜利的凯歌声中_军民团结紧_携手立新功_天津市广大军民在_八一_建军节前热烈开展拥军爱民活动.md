In the triumphant march towards the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the people of Tianjin, both military and civilian, are united in their efforts to achieve new victories. In the days leading up to the August 1st Army Day, the people of Tianjin have enthusiastically launched a series of activities to support the military and show love for the people.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Tianjin on the 29th, in the days leading up to the August 1st Army Day, the revolutionary masses of Tianjin and the broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tianjin have extensively carried out activities to support the military and show love for the people. They have strengthened the unity between the military and the people, joined hands, and achieved new victories in the great struggle to win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Tianjin Revolutionary Committee recently issued a notice celebrating the 41st anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, calling on the revolutionary masses to follow the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on "supporting the military and loving the people" and launch a new high tide of activities to support the military and show love for the people. Factories, enterprises, schools, government agencies, and neighborhoods across the city have held symposiums and various forms of reporting meetings to study Chairman Mao's instructions on "supporting the military and loving the people." They have extensively discussed the great achievements of the People's Liberation Army in the "three supports and two militaries" work. Many units have organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes to learn from the People's Liberation Army's experiences in actively applying Mao Zedong Thought and emphasizing proletarian politics. At a Mao Zedong Thought study class held at the Tianjin Balance Instrument Factory, workers expressed their determination to learn from the People's Liberation Army in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and emphasizing proletarian politics. They have taken the People's Liberation Army as an example, further deepened the revolutionary criticism, severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and greatly enhanced their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness. During the support-the-military activities, many units have reviewed and revised their "support-the-military agreements." Residents of Dacampu Street in Hexi District have reviewed and revised their "support-the-military agreements."

The broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the Tianjin garrison, who have achieved new victories in the "three supports and two militaries" work, have extensively carried out activities to support the government and love the people. They said: firmly supporting, vigorously assisting, enthusiastically helping, and bravely defending the newly born revolutionary committees is the greatest support for the government; believing in and relying on the masses, protecting the broad masses of the people, and suppressing a handful of class enemies is the greatest love for the people. The broad ranks of soldiers and officers fighting on the front lines of the "three supports and two militaries" have actively passed on the honorable traditions of the army in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the four firsts, and carrying forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement to the revolutionary committees and revolutionary masses. The soldiers and officers executing military training tasks at Tianjin Yanan Middle School, together with the members of the revolutionary committee, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on politics being the commander and the soul, making the revolutionary committee put political work in the foremost position, leading the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students to advance courageously along the direction of educational revolution indicated by Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The rights obtained by the people must never be easily lost and must be defended by struggle." After the establishment of revolutionary committees at all levels, the broad ranks of soldiers and officers still maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, helping the revolutionary committees to analyze the new situation, new trends, and new characteristics of class struggle, actively and unceasingly launching fierce attacks on the class enemies, making the newly born revolutionary committees continuously consolidate and develop in the great storms of class struggle.

    天津市广大军民在“八一”建军节前热烈开展拥军爱民活动
    据新华社天津二十九日电　“八一”建军节前，天津市广大革命群众和人民解放军驻天津部队广大指战员，广泛开展拥军爱民活动，加强军民团结，并肩携手，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中立新功。
    天津市革命委员会最近发出庆祝中国人民解放军建军四十一周年的通知，要求广大革命群众遵循伟大领袖毛主席“拥军爱民”的教导，掀起拥军爱民活动的新高潮。全市工厂、企业、学校、机关、街道普遍举行座谈会和各种形式的讲用会，学习毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大指示，大讲解放军在“三支”“两军”工作中的丰功伟绩。许多单位举办毛泽东思想学习班，学习解放军活学活用毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治的经验。在天津衡器厂举办的毛泽东思想学习班上，工人们表示，决心把解放军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治的经验学到手。他们以解放军为榜样，更加深入地开展革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。在拥军活动中，许多单位检查和修订了“拥军公约”。河西区大营门街居民，纷纷检查和修订了“拥军公约”。
    在“三支”“两军”工作中为人民立了新功的天津驻军广大指战员，广泛开展了拥政爱民活动。他们说：坚决拥护、大力支持、热情帮助、勇敢捍卫新生的革命委员会，是最大的拥政；相信和依靠人民群众，保护广大人民群众，镇压一小撮阶级敌人，是最大的爱民。战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的广大指战员在拥政爱民活动中，积极把部队活学活用毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风等光荣传统传给革命委员会和革命群众。在天津延安中学执行军训任务的指战员，和革委会成员一起反复学习毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂的伟大教导，使革委会把政治工作摆在一切工作的首位，带领全校革命师生，沿着毛主席指引的教育革命的方向奋勇前进。
    毛主席教导我们：“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”各级革委会普遍建立以后，广大指战员仍然保持高度的革命警惕，帮助革委会分析阶级斗争的新形势、新动向、新特点，主动地、不停顿地向阶级敌人发动猛攻，使新生的革命委员会，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，不断巩固和发展。
