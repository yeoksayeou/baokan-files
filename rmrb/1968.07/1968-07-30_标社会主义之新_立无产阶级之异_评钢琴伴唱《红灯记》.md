In the midst of the great victory of the Cultural Revolution, the arts front in the capital has brought forth another piece of revolutionary good news: a new form of proletarian revolutionary art—the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern," shining with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, has been born in socialist New China!

The resounding and stirring piano music expresses the proletariat's "ambitious spirit soaring to the heavens"; the majestic and heroic melody plays out the proletariat's "bravery and courage throughout the body." People, with hearts full of excitement, proudly say: This is ours, our proletarian revolutionary art, the march of our era!

Under the personal cultivation and guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing, this new form of proletarian revolutionary art has been born, pioneering socialism's newness and establishing the distinctiveness of the proletariat, opening up a new path for Western instruments and symphonic music, and opening up a new path for the accompaniment of our great motherland's drama. This is a great innovation in the history of world art, a new victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for the arts!

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in a letter about the reform of Peking Opera: "History is created by the people, but on the old stage (and in all old literature and art that is divorced from the people) the people are reduced to dregs, ruled over by masters, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies."

For hundreds of years, the stage of piano art has also been ruled by masters, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies.

Look at the "heroes" created by those bourgeois piano "masters": what "Devil," "Water Sprite," "Countess," "Emperor's Concerto," thousands of chapters, millions of verses, is there even one chapter sung for the laboring people? No, never. The keys produce the evil sounds of the exploiters being exalted and the laborers being belittled, the reactionary tunes of "oppression is reasonable" and "resistance is guilty."

Listen to the so-called "eternal" themes of bourgeois piano art, blown up to be godly: what life and death, love and hate, God and tomb, thousands of chapters, millions of verses, is there even one verse played for the laboring people? No, never. The piano expresses the decadent, corrupt, and despondent emotions of the exploiting class, playing the enervating, corrupting, and poisonous tunes of the bourgeoisie that numb, corrupt, and poison the laboring people.

Evil becomes "great," shamelessness becomes "noble," ruffians become "heroes," executioners become "heroes"… Behind those "fantasy pieces" and "dream pieces" masked with "elegance," the bourgeoisie attempts to use this reversal of history to "fantasize" about the bourgeoisie's eternal "immortality" and "dream" about the capitalist system's eternal "existence"!

As early as more than twenty years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao proposed: art must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the reversed history must be reversed again. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the arts, Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, Lin Mo-han, and their gang, fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line for the arts, stubbornly pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in the arts. They kowtowed to bourgeois and revisionist art, shamelessly calling Soviet revisionist experts the "ancestors" of "transmitting and spreading doctrine" and the "brilliant stars" of Western bourgeois "art masters." They "made every effort to preserve the old things so that they could escape death," allowing the black goods of feudalism, bourgeoisie, revisionism, and the old, foreign, and classical to continue to dominate our piano art stage. Our era is the era of the comprehensive collapse of imperialism and the worldwide victory of socialism. Our workers, peasants, and soldiers, under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, create how many earth-shaking deeds every day, composing how many magnificent and moving chapters. But what the piano plays is the bourgeoisie's mess of things. The Chinese Khrushchev said: "Engaging in entertainment and rest encourages socialist enthusiasm." Is that really the case? No! They are not engaging in any "entertainment" or "rest," but clearly using art as a weapon to serve the restoration of capitalism, "encouraging" people's capitalist enthusiasm, and peacefully transforming socialist China onto the capitalist road!

To smash the Chinese Khrushchev's gang's evil plot of using piano art to restore capitalism, as early as 1964, Comrade Jiang Qing, based on Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts of "serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers" and "using the West for China," and "pushing the old to bring forth the new," proposed that the piano should accompany revolutionary modern Peking Opera. However, a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists entrenched in the arts fiercely blocked this important directive, preventing it from meeting with revolutionary art warriors for a long time. The tumultuous Cultural Revolution overthrew this small clique of class enemies, removing these stumbling blocks. Under the personal leadership and guidance of our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, after conquering the stubborn fortress of Peking Opera, revolutionary art warriors, with even greater confidence, riding the victorious east wind of the Cultural Revolution, launched a heroic assault on the stubborn Western fortress of the piano. They displayed great daring and pioneering spirit, daring to walk their own path, daring to walk paths that no one has walked before. Through repeated practice, they finally successfully created the brilliant piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern."

This is a victory song of Mao Zedong Thought. The piano, which has always served the reactionary ruling class, has for the first time burst out from the feudal aristocrats', bourgeoisie's palaces, and elegant chambers, and ascended the stage of workers', peasants', and soldiers' revolutionary art. "The swallows that once flew over the mansions of Wang and Xie now fly into ordinary people's homes." The success of the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" has brought the Western instrument, the piano, which was divorced from the people and on the brink of extinction, back into the hands of the proletariat and the laboring people, making it a weapon of the proletariat.

This is a great innovation in the history of world art. In the history of the piano, for the first time, it has trampled underfoot the bourgeois Westerners and the dead, sweeping away the decadent and enervating tunes of the bourgeoisie, with a magnificent demeanor and a soaring melody, sculpting the towering image of the proletariat's "unyielding and unyielding struggle against the enemy" and expressing the proletariat's "determination to fight to the end without surrendering the battlefield."

The piano is the same piano, but in the hands of different classes, serving different classes, it has different fates and different destinies. In the Western bourgeois world of "setting sun, gasping for breath," piano art has fallen to the pathetic state of having apes perform on stage and smashing pianos to win the audience's applause; in the socialist New China of "rising sun, illuminating the world," piano art has taken the brilliant path of creation for the workers, peasants, and soldiers and utilization by the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Thinking of the decline of the Western bourgeoisie and looking at the rebirth of our piano art, how can we not be exhilarated and proud of this great revolution!

The revolution of breaking the old and establishing the new, destroying the bourgeoisie and promoting the proletariat, is rolling forward with irresistible momentum. In this great revolutionary storm, we lose only the decayed and tattered old arts of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie, but we gain the further prosperity of proletarian revolutionary art, the further penetration of Mao Zedong Thought, and the further consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat!

The new form of proletarian revolutionary art—the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern"—is a magnificent song of revolutionary heroes resonating through the clouds. With its magnificent and overwhelming momentum, clear and uplifting tones, and majestic and beautiful melodies, it deeply reveals the sublime spiritual world of revolutionary heroes.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: proletarian revolutionary art must "praise the proletariat and the laboring people." The "Minutes of the Symposium on Army Literary and Art Work Convened by Comrade Lin Biao at the Request of Comrade Jiang Qing," revised three times by Chairman Mao, points out: "Efforts must be made to create heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is the fundamental task of socialist art." The piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern," based on the music of the Peking Opera "The Red Lantern," not only retains the advantages of the original singing style but also fully utilizes the strengths of the piano, creating a more perfect and profound image of the proletarian revolutionary heroes Li Yuhe and Li Tie Mei.

The piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" has meticulously sculpted the image of Li Yuhe. The powerful rhythm and firm sound form the basic characteristics of the accompaniment to Li Yuhe's singing.

A bowl of farewell wine, a thousand layers of class feelings. In the famous aria "Brave and Bold Throughout the Body," the piano fully utilizes its rich expressiveness. The solemn and tragic prelude, the rolling and thick accompaniment that runs through the entire piece, and the sudden burst of intense and stirring sounds at the end, fully express Li Yuhe's boundless class feelings for Grandma Li and Li Tie Mei, and Li Yuhe's fearless revolutionary heroism.

"Ambition Soaring to the Heavens" is the most important set of arias in the Peking Opera "The Red Lantern" that concentrates on sculpting Li Yuhe's heroic image. In the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern," this aria, with its magnificent and broad music, expresses Li Yuhe's "ambition soaring to the heavens" with strong artistic infectivity. "With sacrifice comes great ambition, daring to change the heavens and the earth." Li Yuhe, facing death threats without fear, envisions the revolutionary future with even firmer resolve. Before the beginning of the Erhuang introduction, the piano successfully adds a prelude. The muddy and sharp sounds contrast with the cruelty and weakness of Yama Mountain; the heavy and steady low notes express Li Yuhe's dignified and resolute steps out of the prison. As the piano music gradually rises, although the long aria has not yet begun, Li Yuhe's towering heroic image already stands firmly before us. When Li Yuhe sings "The chains cannot hold my ambition soaring to the heavens," the piano surges up from the low register with irresistible momentum, with a swift and lively melody and a majestic and overwhelming demeanor, vividly and dynamically expressing Li Yuhe's revolutionary heroism of "daring to overcome all enemies and never being subdued by the enemy." After the line "Walking to the execution ground, head held high, looking far ahead," the piano greatly breaks through and develops the original Peking Opera's interlude, creating a very brilliant solo. Here, the piano plays the sounds symbolizing the revolutionary red lantern, first appearing clearly and brightly in the high register, quickly expanding, and finally with the magnificent demeanor of the entire piano, performing passionately and magnificently, deeply and profoundly expressing Li Yuhe's sublime revolutionary ideals and broad revolutionary breast: he sees not the enemy's arrogance and brutality, but the anti-Japanese flames have become a raging inferno, the once rampant Japanese imperialism has fallen into the sea of people's war; he sees not the chains that bind him, but after the storm, "New China, like the rising sun, illuminating the world!" The following slow section, the piano accompaniment becomes colorful and brilliant, vividly depicting the magnificent scene of "red flags planted all over China," giving the audience a very strong artistic impact. After the entire aria ends, the piano, with unique creativity, moves the tune used in the Peking Opera before this aria to the end, with a magnificent and vast demeanor and a majestic and unrestrained melody, making us feel that Li Yuhe is not walking to the execution ground but with a belief in victory and a smile of victory, welcoming the battle of tomorrow, welcoming the glorious future!

In this entire aria, the piano, with abundant passion and magnificent demeanor, passionately praises Li Yuhe's fearlessness of sacrifice and noble revolutionary qualities and spirit, expressing Li Yuhe's high vision, fearlessness of death, revolutionary heroism, and revolutionary optimism.

The piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" also deeply portrays Li Tie Mei's growth process under the cultivation of the great Party and revolutionary forerunners in the stormy class struggle. From "Everyone Has a Bright Red Heart" to "Hatred Grows in the Heart," the musical image has layers and development, and Li Tie Mei's image becomes more perfect and towering.

In the aria "Everyone Has a Bright Red Heart," the piano fully utilizes its wide range, bright timbre, and agile performance, with a lively and flowing accompaniment throughout, vividly portraying Li Tie Mei's innocent, lively, and slightly childish personality.

Hearing Grandma talk about the red lantern is an important part of Li Tie Mei's growth. The piano accompaniment here has very outstanding artistic handling. After Li Tie Mei "hears Grandma talk about the red lantern," she is deeply moved and falls into deep thought. The piano mimics the plucking sounds of national instruments, lightly and yet very expressively playing a series of staccato notes, deeply portraying the atmosphere at that time, deeply immersing the actor and the audience in Li Tie Mei's thoughts and feelings, reaching a very high artistic realm. Here, the piano is not only new in thought content but also breaks through the old routines in performance technology. When Li Tie Mei sings "why did they," seriously pondering the revolutionary truth, the piano lightly supports the singing with the simplest method, immediately turning in the interlude with Li Tie Mei's inner turmoil, suddenly turning, expressing that Li Tie Mei has found the answer, using a magnificent and firm sound to bring out her resolute answer: "It is to save China, save the poor, defeat the enemy soldiers." When Li Tie Mei thinks about what she should do, the piano turns to a soft accompaniment until Li Tie Mei sings "Father carries a thousand-pound burden, Tie Mei, you should carry this eight hundred pounds," the piano then displays its magnificent demeanor, powerfully portraying Li Tie Mei's ambitious spirit to be a revolutionary successor.

In the aria "Hatred Grows in the Heart," the piano, with an extremely uplifting and intense accompaniment, prominently expresses Li Tie Mei's intense class hatred and national resentment. Finally, Li Tie Mei sings the revolutionary oath: "I, Tie Mei, am prepared: not afraid of being caught, not afraid of being released, not afraid of being beaten with whips, not afraid of being imprisoned! Even if my body is crushed, I will not reveal the secret code!" At this time, the piano, with a firm and full rhythm and sound, vividly expresses Li Tie Mei's unshakable revolutionary will after undergoing the severe test of class struggle. A brilliant image of a revolutionary successor who holds high the revolutionary red lantern appears before us!

The piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern," born under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, prominently sculpts the image of proletarian heroes, embodying the principle of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, with distinct characteristics of the times and the nation, achieving the unity of "revolutionary political content and the most perfect artistic form possible." It is another brilliant gem shining with the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought!

What to praise and what to oppose, this is the fundamental question of for whom art serves. The bourgeoisie wants to praise their own heroes, propagate their own ideals, demands, and wishes, and change the world according to the bourgeoisie's image; the proletariat also wants to create their own heroes, propagate their own ideals, demands, and wishes, and change the world according to the proletariat's image. This is a sharp and intense class struggle. The birth of the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" has made the piano art, which has been singing praises to the bourgeoisie for hundreds of years, "open a new chapter" in its history, creating a new era of singing praises to the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is another major victory in the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the field of art, another major victory in the struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line for the arts and the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line for the arts!

Following the revolutionary symphonic music "The Battle of Shanggangling" and the revolutionary ballets "The Red Detachment of Women" and "The White-Haired Girl," the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" is another brilliant example of "using the West for China" and "pushing the old to bring forth the new."

The success of the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" not only opens up a new path for the revolution of Western instruments and symphonic music but also opens up a new path for the accompaniment of our great motherland's drama. The success of the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" heralds the imminent surge of the revolutionary storm of Western instruments and symphonic music and the imminent rolling tide of the revolutionary storm of the accompaniment of our motherland's drama!

The piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" successfully absorbs the good things from foreign piano art, critically uses many important expressive methods from the traditional art of the piano, sweeping away the decadent and enervating tunes and formalistic decay of bourgeois piano art; based on the revolutionary political content of the Peking Opera "The Red Lantern," it has made many new creations in expressive methods and performance technology. This reform of piano art makes the ancient Western instrument, the piano, play the voice of the proletariat, play the sound of socialism, and walk on the broad road of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, proletarian politics, and socialism, opening up a bright future for the revolution of Western instruments and symphonic music.

The piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" organically combines the traditional art of our country, Peking Opera, and the traditional art of a foreign country, the piano, complementing each other, taking the advantages and making up for the shortcomings, retaining the basic characteristics of Peking Opera singing and percussion, and fully utilizing the piano's wide range, magnificent demeanor, and rich expressiveness. This combination enriches and develops Peking Opera accompaniment, bringing about a revolutionary change, opening up a broad path for the accompaniment of our motherland's drama to better reflect the socialist era and better sculpt the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" is a new form of proletarian revolutionary art. It organically combines "the West" and "China," "pushing the old to bring forth the new," different from the traditional art of foreign countries and also different from the traditional art of China, with distinct characteristics of the times and the nation.

The success of the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" fully demonstrates the tremendous power of Chairman Mao's great policy of "using the West for China" and "pushing the old to bring forth the new."

"Using the West for China" means to critically absorb the good things from foreign art and use them for our socialist China. "Pushing the old to bring forth the new" means to "push" the old things of feudalism and capitalism and "bring forth" the new things of socialism—the new content of socialism and the national forms that are popular among the Chinese people.

"The communist revolution is the most radical break with traditional property relations; no wonder it must also make the most radical break with traditional ideas in its course of development." The traditional art of foreign countries, in terms of content, is mostly the propagation of the "traditional ideas" of feudalism and capitalism. This content cannot be pushed to bring forth the new. As for the excellent art forms of foreign countries, they still have their advantages and can be pushed to bring forth the new and used by us today. To develop our socialist new art, we need to critically absorb and inherit the excellent art forms of foreign countries. To foreign art forms, not distinguishing between good and bad, completely rejecting them, and taking a nihilistic attitude is completely wrong. At the same time, foreign art forms must be transformed to express our socialist new content and be popular among the Chinese people. Blindly worshipping Western art forms, thinking that everything is good because it is "foreign," not reforming, not pushing the old to bring forth the new, and taking a completely affirmative attitude is also fundamentally wrong. In dealing with the issue of foreign art forms, we oppose both the nihilistic attitude and the completely affirmative attitude.

The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the arts, Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, Lin Mo-han, and their ilk, to meet the needs of restoring capitalism, to oppose "using the West for China" and "pushing the old to bring forth the new," they sometimes advocate "complete Westernization," saying nonsense about Western instruments only being able to perform the "model works" of "Western art masters," demanding that those who play Western instruments "truly fall into the West," and "go Western to the end." They sometimes make a 180-degree turn, pretending to be xenophobic, saying nonsense about Western instruments "not being able to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers," ordering those who learn Western instruments to all change careers, and "go native to the end." The birth of the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" declares the complete bankruptcy of the Chinese Khrushchev's and their ilk's fallacies of "going Western to the end" and "going native to the end"!

Today, we are in a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. To create socialist new art that is worthy of this great era, we must follow the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings of "using the West for China" and "pushing the old to bring forth the new," daring to pioneer socialism's newness and establish the distinctiveness of the proletariat, blazing a trail of our own.

Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress. We must thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in the arts, thoroughly eliminate the superstition of the literary and artistic heritage of feudalism and capitalism, and carry out an unprecedented broad and deep revolution in the field of culture and art. Only revolution can pioneer socialism's newness; only revolution can establish the distinctiveness of the proletariat; only revolution can blaze a trail of our own. Lu Xun once said: "Without a pioneer who breaks through all traditional thoughts and methods, China will not have true new art." Comrade Jiang Qing is an outstanding proletarian revolutionary pioneer. She raises high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, leading revolutionary art workers to launch fierce attacks on one after another stubborn fortresses in the art battlefield. The momentum is like a sudden storm and thunder, the force is like thunder and lightning, invincible, and unyielding. The stubborn fortress of Peking Opera has been conquered! The stubborn fortress of ballet has been conquered! The stubborn fortress of symphonic music has been conquered! Now, the stubborn fortress of piano art has also been conquered! "The new pines regret not being a thousand feet tall, the evil bamboos should be cut down by the ten thousand." We should take Comrade Jiang Qing as our example, carry forward the great daring and pioneering spirit, dare to innovate, dare to create, walk our own path, and strive for the creation of socialist new art with distinct characteristics of the times and the nation, popular among the Chinese people!

Thirty-four years ago, the great pioneer of cultural revolution, Lu Xun, prophesied: "The future brightness will prove that we are not only the preservers of the heritage of literature and art but also the pioneers and builders." Lu Xun's brilliant prophecy has become a shining reality today. The birth of the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" once again declares to the world: the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the great "pioneers" and "builders" of literature and art. We not only can reform all the superstructures that do not adapt to the socialist economic base, sweep away all the garbage of feudalism, bourgeoisie, and revisionism that corrupts the people's thoughts and undermines the people's fighting spirit, but we will definitely open up a new path for socialist art and build the most brilliant and radiant new art that opens a new epoch in human history, writing the newest and most beautiful chapters in human history!

"We not only are good at destroying an old world, we will also be good at building a new world."

    标社会主义之新　立无产阶级之异
    ——评钢琴伴唱《红灯记》
    任文欣
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势下，首都文艺战线又传出了一个振奋人心的革命喜讯：无产阶级革命文艺的新品种——钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，在社会主义的新中国诞生了！
    铿锵激越的琴声，抒发了无产阶级“雄心壮志冲云天”的革命豪情；高昂雄伟的曲调，奏出了无产阶级“浑身是胆雄赳赳”的英雄气概！人们怀着激动的心情自豪地说：这是我们的，我们无产阶级的革命艺术，我们时代的战斗的进行曲！
    在江青同志亲自培育和指导下诞生的这个无产阶级革命文艺的新品种，标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，为西洋乐器和交响乐的革命开辟了一条新的道路，为我们伟大祖国的戏剧伴奏开辟了一条新的道路。这是世界艺术史上的伟大创举，这是毛主席革命文艺路线的新胜利！钢琴艺术划时代的大革命
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在关于京剧革命的一封信上指出：“历史是人民创造的，但在旧戏舞台上（在一切离开人民的旧文学旧艺术上）人民却成了渣滓，由老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着舞台”。
    几百年来，钢琴艺术的舞台也是由老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着的。
    看看那些资产阶级钢琴艺术“大师”所塑造的“英雄”人物吧！什么《魔鬼》、《水妖》，什么《伯爵夫人》、《皇帝协奏曲》，千章万曲，有哪一章是为劳动人民而歌的？没有，从来没有。琴键上弹奏出来的是剥削者崇高、劳动者渺小的罪恶之声，是“压迫就是合理”、“反抗就是有罪”的反动之音。
    听听被资产阶级吹得神乎其神的所谓钢琴艺术“永恒”的主题吧！什么生死、爱恨，什么上帝、坟墓，万曲千章，有哪一曲是为劳动人民而奏的？没有，从来没有。钢琴上抒发的是剥削阶级没落、腐朽、颓丧的感情，弹出的是资产阶级麻痹、腐蚀、毒害劳动人民的靡靡之音。
    丑恶成了“伟大”，无耻成了“高尚”，流氓成了“好汉”，刽子手成了“英雄”……。在那些蒙着“优雅”面纱的什么“幻想曲”、“狂想曲”的后面，资产阶级妄图用这种历史的颠倒，“幻想”资产阶级永远“不朽”，“狂想”资本主义制度永远“长存”！
    早在二十多年前，我们伟大的领袖毛主席就提出：文艺必须为工农兵服务，颠倒的历史必须再颠倒过来。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在文艺界的代理人周扬、夏衍、林默涵等一伙，却极力对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线，顽固地推行反革命修正主义的文艺黑线。他们奴颜婢膝地拜倒在资产阶级、修正主义艺术的脚下，无耻地称苏修专家是“传经播道”的“始祖”，西方资产阶级的“艺术大师”是“灿烂”的“群星”。他们“以种种努力去保持旧事物使它得免于死亡”，让封、资、修和名、洋、古的黑货继续霸占我们的钢琴艺术舞台。我们的时代，是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的新时代，我们的工人、农民、士兵，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，每天创造着多少惊天动地的事迹，谱写了多少雄伟动人的乐章。可是，钢琴上奏出的却是资产阶级的乌七八糟的东西。中国赫鲁晓夫说：“搞娱乐、休息，就鼓励了社会主义积极性了”。果真如此吗？不！他们哪里是在搞什么“娱乐”、“休息”，分明是在利用文艺这个武器为复辟资本主义服务，“鼓励”人们的资本主义的积极性，把社会主义的中国“和平演变”到资本主义道路上去！
    为了粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫一伙利用钢琴艺术复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，早在一九六四年，江青同志就根据毛主席关于文艺要为工农兵服务和“洋为中用”，“推陈出新”的光辉思想，要钢琴为革命现代京剧伴唱。但是，盘踞在文艺界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子却横加封锁，使这一重要指示迟迟不能和革命文艺战士见面。轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，打倒了这一小撮阶级敌人，踢开了这些绊脚石。在我们敬爱的江青同志的亲自率领和指导下，革命文艺战士继攻克了京剧这一顽固的堡垒之后，又满怀信心，乘着无产阶级文化大革命胜利的东风，向着钢琴这一顽固的洋堡垒展开了英勇的进攻。他们发扬了大无畏的革命首创精神，敢于走自己的路，敢于走前人没有走过的路，经过反复的实践，终于成功地创作了光彩夺目的钢琴伴唱《红灯记》。
    这是一曲毛泽东思想胜利的凯歌。钢琴这个一向为反动统治阶级服务的工具，第一次从封建贵族、资产阶级的帝阙宫苑、华厅幽室里冲杀了出来，登上了工农兵革命文艺的舞台。“旧时王谢堂前燕，飞入寻常百姓家。”钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的成功，使钢琴这个脱离人民、濒于绝境的西洋乐器回到了无产阶级和劳动人民的手里，成为无产阶级的战斗武器。
    这是世界艺术史上的伟大创举。在钢琴历史上，它第一次把资产阶级的洋人、死人踩在脚下，把资产阶级没落、颓废的靡靡之音一扫而空，以雄伟的气魄，昂扬的曲调，塑造了无产阶级“不屈不挠斗敌顽”的高大英雄形象，抒发了无产阶级“打不尽豺狼决不下战场”的壮志豪情。
    琴，是一样的琴，掌握在不同阶级的手里，为不同的阶级服务，却有着不同的前途，不同的命运。在“日薄西山，气息奄奄”的西方资产阶级世界，钢琴艺术已堕落到请猩猩上台演奏，用砸钢琴来博得观众喝采的可悲境地；在“似朝阳，光照人间”的社会主义新中国，钢琴艺术却走上了为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的光辉的道路。想想西方资产阶级的没落，看看我们钢琴艺术的新生，我们怎能不为这场伟大的革命而振奋，而自豪呢！
    文艺领域里破旧立新、灭资兴无的革命，正以不可阻挡之势滚滚向前。在这场伟大的革命风暴中，我们失去的只是那些没落的、破烂不堪的地主阶级、资产阶级的旧文艺，而我们得到的将是无产阶级革命文艺的进一步繁荣，毛泽东思想的进一步深入，无产阶级专政的进一步巩固！无产阶级英雄的壮丽颂歌
    无产阶级革命文艺的新品种——钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，是一曲响彻云霄的革命英雄的壮丽颂歌。它以雄伟磅礴的气势，高昂明朗的音调，雄壮优美的旋律，深刻地展现了革命英雄的崇高的精神世界。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：无产阶级革命文艺必须“歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民”。经过毛主席三次审阅修改的《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》指出：“要努力塑造工农兵的英雄人物，这是社会主义文艺的根本任务。”钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，在京剧《红灯记》音乐的基础上，既保留了原有唱腔的优点，又发挥了钢琴的特长，更完美、更深刻地塑造了无产阶级革命英雄李玉和、李铁梅的光辉形象。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》对李玉和的英雄形象作了精心的塑造。铿锵有力的节奏，挺拔坚实的音响，构成了李玉和唱腔伴奏的基本特点。
    一碗送别酒，万重阶级情。在《浑身是胆雄赳赳》这一著名唱段中，钢琴充分地发挥了表现力丰富的长处。激昂悲壮的前奏，贯串全曲的翻滚浑厚的伴奏，最后突然爆发的强烈的激动人心的音响，把李玉和对李奶奶、李铁梅无比深厚的阶级感情，把李玉和大无畏的革命英雄气概，淋漓尽致地表现出来了。
    《雄心壮志冲云天》是京剧《红灯记》中集中塑造李玉和英雄形象的一段最重要的成套唱腔。钢琴伴唱《红灯记》在这个唱段中，以雄伟、宽广的音乐，用强烈的艺术感染力，抒发了李玉和“雄心壮志冲云天”的革命豪情。“为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天。”李玉和身在刑场，心怀天下，面对死亡威胁无所畏惧，展望革命前程斗志更坚。在开始的二黄导板以前，钢琴成功地增添了一段前奏。混浊尖锐的音响，衬托出鸠山的凶残与虚弱；沉重稳健的低音，表现了李玉和大义凛然、迈步出监的坚定步伐。随着钢琴音乐的逐渐高昂，虽然大段的唱腔还没有开始，但是李玉和高大的英雄形象已经巍然挺立在我们面前。当李玉和唱出“锁不住我雄心壮志冲云天”这一革命的豪言壮语时，钢琴从低音区以不可阻挡之势汹涌澎湃直冲上来，急骤明快的旋律，雄壮磅礴的气势，十分形象而生动地表现了李玉和“要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”的革命英雄气概。在“赴刑场，气昂昂，抬头远看”这一句以后，钢琴大大突破和发展了原来京剧唱腔的过门，创造了一段极为精采的独奏。在这里，钢琴奏出的象征着革命红灯的音调，先在高音区清澈而嘹亮地出现，很快地扩展开来，最后以整个钢琴的宏伟气势，慷慨激昂的演奏，丰富而深刻地抒发了李玉和的崇高的革命理想和博大的革命胸怀：他看到的不是敌人的嚣张残暴，而是抗日的烽火已成燎原之势，横行一时的日本帝国主义已陷于人民战争的千里火海中；他看到的不是锁住他的重重镣铐，而是风雨过后，“新中国，似朝阳，光照人间”！接下来的这段慢板，钢琴伴奏变得绚丽多彩，灿烂光明，形象地烘托出“全中国，红旗插遍”的壮丽图景，给听众以极为强烈的艺术感染。在全部唱腔结束以后，钢琴又富有独创地将原来京剧中用在这段唱腔之前的曲调移作尾声，排山倒海的壮阔的气势，雄浑奔放的高昂的旋律，使我们感到李玉和不是在走向刑场，而是怀着必胜的信念，含着胜利的微笑，在迎接战斗的明天，迎接光辉的未来！
    在这整个唱段中，钢琴用充沛的激情，雄伟的气势，热情地歌颂了李玉和不怕牺牲、慷慨就义的崇高品质和革命气节，表现了李玉和高瞻远瞩，视死如归的革命英雄主义和革命乐观主义精神。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》还深刻地刻划了李铁梅在伟大的党和革命先辈的培育下，在阶级斗争的急风暴雨中迅速成长的过程。从《都有一颗红亮的心》到《仇恨入心要发芽》，音乐形象有层次，有发展，李铁梅的形象越来越完美，越来越高大。
    在《都有一颗红亮的心》这个唱段中，钢琴充分发挥了音域宽广、音色明亮、演奏灵巧的特点，以贯串始终的活跃、流动的伴奏音型，生动地刻划了李铁梅天真、活泼而又带着几分稚气的性格。
    听奶奶说红灯，是李铁梅成长过程中重要的一环。钢琴伴唱在这里有很出色的艺术处理。铁梅“听罢奶奶说红灯”，深受感动，陷入沉思，钢琴模仿民族乐器弹拨乐的音响效果，轻轻地而又极富表现力地弹奏出一串碎音调，深刻地刻划出当时的意境，把演员和听众都深深地带入到李铁梅的思想感情中，达到了很高的艺术境界。在这里，钢琴不仅在思想内容上是崭新的，在演奏技术上也打破了外国的老一套。当铁梅唱到“他们到底为什么”，认真思索革命道理的时候，钢琴以最简洁的手法轻轻托住唱腔，紧接着在过门中随着铁梅内心活动的起伏变化，猛然一转，表示铁梅已经得出了答案，用气势磅礴、坚定有力的音响，带出了她斩钉截铁的回答：“为的是救中国、救穷人，打败鬼子兵。”当铁梅想到她自己应该怎么办的时候，钢琴又转为轻声衬托，直到铁梅唱出了“爹爹挑担有千斤重，铁梅你，应该挑上这八百斤”，钢琴才发挥出雄伟的气势，有力地烘托了铁梅誓做革命接班人的雄心壮志。
    在《仇恨入心要发芽》一段中，钢琴以无比高昂、激烈的伴奏，突出地表现了铁梅“提起敌寇心肺炸”的强烈的阶级仇，民族恨。最后，铁梅唱出了革命的誓言：“铁梅我，有准备：不怕抓，不怕放，不怕皮鞭打，不怕监牢押！粉身碎骨不交密电码！”这时，钢琴又以坚定有力的节奏和坚实饱满的音响，鲜明地表现出铁梅经历了阶级斗争严峻考验后的无比坚定的革命意志。一个高举革命红灯，已经成长起来的革命接班人的光辉形象，英姿飒爽地在我们面前出现了！
    在毛泽东思想阳光照耀下诞生的钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，突出地塑造了无产阶级的英雄形象，体现了革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的原则，具有鲜明的时代特点和民族特点，达到了“革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一”。它是又一颗闪耀着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的艺术明珠！
    歌颂什么，反对什么，这是关系到文艺为什么人服务的根本问题。资产阶级要歌颂自己的英雄人物，宣扬自己的理想、要求和愿望，按照资产阶级的面貌改造世界；无产阶级也要塑造自己的英雄人物，宣传自己的理想、要求和愿望，按照无产阶级的面貌改造世界。这是一场尖锐、激烈的阶级斗争。钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的诞生，使几百年来一直为资产阶级唱赞美诗的钢琴艺术，从此“开了新生面”，在自己的历史上开创了为工农兵奏颂歌的新纪元。这是文艺领域里无产阶级同资产阶级斗争取得的又一重大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线同中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义文艺路线斗争取得的又一重大胜利！洋为中用　推陈出新　走自己的路
    继革命交响音乐《沙家浜》、革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》《白毛女》之后出现的钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，是又一个“洋为中用”，“推陈出新”的光辉典范。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的成功，不仅为西洋乐器和交响乐的革命开辟了一条新的道路，而且为我们伟大祖国的戏剧伴奏开辟了一条新的道路。钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的成功，预示着西洋乐器和交响乐大革命的风暴即将蓬勃兴起，预示着祖国戏剧伴奏大革命的洪流即将滚滚而来！
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，成功地吸收了外国钢琴艺术中的好东西，批判地运用了钢琴传统艺术中的许多重要表现手法，一扫资产阶级钢琴艺术颓废、缠绵的靡靡之音和形式主义的腐朽的东西；又根据京剧《红灯记》的革命的政治内容，在表现方法、演奏技术上作了许多新的创造。钢琴艺术的这种改革，使钢琴这个古老的西洋乐器奏出了无产阶级之声，弹出了社会主义之音，走上了为工农兵、为无产阶级政治、为社会主义服务的康庄大道，为西洋乐器和交响乐的革命开辟了远大的前程。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，把京剧这一我国的传统艺术和钢琴这一外国的传统艺术有机地结合在一起，相辅相成，取长补短，既保留了京剧唱腔和打击乐的基本特点，又充分发挥了钢琴音域宽广，气势雄伟，富于表现力的特长。这种结合，使京剧伴奏得到丰富和发展，发生了革命的变化，为祖国的戏剧伴奏更好地反映社会主义时代、更好地塑造工农兵英雄形象开辟了广阔的道路。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》是无产阶级革命文艺的一个新品种，它把“洋”和“中”有机地结合起来，“推陈出新”，既不同于外国的传统艺术，也不同于中国的传统艺术，具有鲜明的时代特点和民族特点。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的成功，充分显示了毛主席提出的“洋为中用”，“推陈出新”伟大方针的无比威力。
      “洋为中用”，就是要把外国艺术中的好东西，批判地吸收过来，为我们的社会主义中国所用。“推陈出新”，就是要“推”封建主义和资本主义之“陈”，“出”社会主义之“新”——社会主义的新内容和为中国老百姓所喜闻乐见的民族形式。
      “共产主义革命就是同传统的所有制关系实行最彻底的决裂；毫不奇怪，它在自己的发展进程中要同传统的观念实行最彻底的决裂。”外国的传统艺术，就其内容来说，大多是宣扬封建主义和资本主义“传统的观念”的东西。这种内容是不能推陈出新的。至于外国的优秀的艺术形式，还是有其长处的，可以推陈出新，为我们今天所用。为了发展我国的社会主义新文艺，我们有必要批判地吸收和继承外国的优秀艺术形式。对于外国的艺术形式，不分青红皂白，一概排斥，采取虚无主义的态度，是完全错误的。同时，外国的艺术形式要表现我们社会主义的新内容，要为中国老百姓所喜闻乐见，也必须进行改造。盲目崇拜西方的艺术形式，以为一切都是“洋”的好，不进行改革，不推陈出新，采取全盘肯定的态度，也是根本错误的。在对待外国艺术形式的问题上，我们既反对虚无主义的态度，也反对全盘肯定的态度。
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其在文艺界的代理人周扬、夏衍、林默涵之流，为了复辟资本主义的需要，为了反对
  “洋为中用”，“推陈出新”的伟大方针，他们忽而主张“全盘西化”，胡说什么西洋乐器只能演奏“西洋艺术大师”的“典范作品”，要搞西洋乐器的人“真正掉到洋的里边去”，要“洋到底”。他们忽而又来个一百八十度大转弯，一个劲地装作排外的模样，胡说什么西洋乐器“不能为工农兵服务”，下令学西洋乐器的人统统改行，要“土到底”。钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的诞生，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫之流“洋到底”和“土到底”谬论的彻底破产！
    今天，我们正处在一个以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。为了创造无愧于我们这个伟大时代的社会主义的新文艺，我们一定要遵循伟大领袖毛主席的
  “洋为中用”，“推陈出新”的教导，敢于标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，闯出一条我们自己的路来。
    不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行。我们必须彻底批判反革命修正主义文艺黑线，彻底破除对封建主义、资本主义文学艺术遗产的迷信，在文化艺术领域里进行一场空前广泛、空前深刻的大革命。革命，才能标出社会主义之新；革命，才能立出无产阶级之异；革命，才能闯出自己的路。鲁迅曾经说过：“没有冲破一切传统思想和手法的闯将，中国是不会有真的新文艺的。”江青同志就是一个杰出的无产阶级革命闯将，她高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，率领革命的文艺工作者向艺术阵地上一个又一个的顽固堡垒发动了猛烈的进攻。其势如急风骤雨，其力如雷霆万钧，所向披靡，攻无不克。京剧这个顽固堡垒被攻克了！芭蕾舞这个顽固堡垒被攻克了！交响乐这个顽固堡垒被攻克了！如今，钢琴艺术这个顽固堡垒也被攻克了！“新松恨不高千尺，恶竹应须斩万竿。”我们要以江青同志为榜样，发扬敢于斗争、敢于胜利的大无畏精神，敢于革新，敢于创造，走我们自己的路，为创立具有鲜明的时代特点和民族特点、为中国老百姓所喜闻乐见的社会主义新文艺而奋斗！
    三十四年前，伟大的文化革命先驱鲁迅这样预言：“将来的光明，必将证明我们不但是文艺上的遗产的保存者，而且也是开拓者和建设者。”鲁迅的天才预言今天已经成为光辉的现实。钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的诞生，又一次向全世界表明：用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，是文学艺术的伟大的“开拓者”和“建设者”。我们不但能够改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，能够扫除一切腐蚀群众思想、瓦解群众斗志的封、资、修的垃圾，而且一定能够开拓出一条社会主义文艺的新道路，建设起开创人类历史新纪元的、最光辉灿烂的新文艺，写出人类历史上最新最美的篇章！
      “我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”
