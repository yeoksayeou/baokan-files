	Italian workers in many cities have launched strikes and protest demonstrations to oppose the brutal oppression and exploitation by the Italian reactionary government and monopolistic capitalists, demanding improved living conditions.

	On July 1, in several towns in the provinces of Trapani and Agrigento in Sicily, massive strikes and demonstrations involving over 100,000 workers and residents paralyzed these towns. The protests were a response to the government's indifference to the plight of residents following a severe earthquake in the region.

	In an industrial area of Naples in southern Italy, workers also held demonstrations on July 1 to protest the closure and demolition of an electrical machinery factory. The factory had been occupied by workers for over three weeks. Demonstrators blocked the Naples-Salerno highway and sealed off the local train station. Hundreds of police, who were sent to suppress the protest, brutally beat workers, their families, and students who came to support them. Despite this, the demonstration continued until late at night. The factory workers held another demonstration in Naples on the morning of July 2.

	In another industrial area on the outskirts of Naples, 2,000 workers at the state-owned steel mill of the Italian Steel Company also held demonstrations to protest the management's refusal to meet their reasonable demands.

	Workers in many other enterprises in Naples are also engaged in struggles with capitalists. Particularly at the Rodia-Toche textile fiber factory, the largest in southern Italy, workers have been on strike for seven days demanding wage increases and other demands.

	In the northern Italian city of Trieste, over 5,000 metal and machinery workers who went on strike held a long demonstration in the city center to protest the capitalists' plan to close the factory, demanding full employment and wage increases. The 24-hour strike by railway workers on July 1 halted all trains in the Milan area, including a quarter of all state-owned railways in Italy.

    意大利工人奋起反压迫反剥削
    许多城市工人纷纷举行罢工和抗议示威
    新华社三日讯　罗马消息：意大利许多城市的工人纷纷举行罢工和示威游行，抗议意大利反动政府和垄断资本家的残酷压迫和剥削，要求改善生活待遇。
    一日，在西西里区的特拉巴尼省和阿格里琴托省的十多个城镇爆发了声势浩大的罢工，总共有十万工人和居民举行了示威游行，使这些城镇陷于瘫痪状态。这次示威游行，是为了抗议政府在这个地区遭到强烈地震后对居民的悲惨处境不闻不问。
    在意大利南部那不勒斯的一个工业区，工人们一日也举行示威游行，抗议资本家关闭和拆除一个电气机械厂。这家工厂已经被工人占领了三个多星期。示威者断绝了那不勒斯—萨勒诺公路的交通，并且封锁了当地的火车站。数百名前来进行镇压的警察野蛮殴打工人、工人家属以及前来支援的学生。但是尽管如此，示威游行还是一直进行到深夜，这个厂的工人在二日上午还在那不勒斯再次举行了示威游行。
    在那不勒斯郊区的另外一个工业区，意大利钢铁公司国营炼钢厂的两千名工人也举行了示威游行，抗议资方拒绝接受他们的合理要求。
    那不勒斯的其他许多企业的工人和资本家展开的斗争也正在发展。特别是在意大利南部最大的纺织纤维厂——罗迪亚托切工厂，工人为增加工资和其他要求而举行的罢工，一日已经进入了第七天。
    在意大利北部的里雅斯特，五千多名举行罢工的五金和机械制造工人，在市中心举行长时间的示威游行，抗议资本家拆除工厂的计划，要求充分就业和增加工资。铁路工人一日举行的二十四小时罢工，使米兰地区火车全部停驶，其中包括意大利全部国营铁路的四分之一。
