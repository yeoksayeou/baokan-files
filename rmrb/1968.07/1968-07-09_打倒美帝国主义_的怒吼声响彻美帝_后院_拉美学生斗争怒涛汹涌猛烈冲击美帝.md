The shouts of "Down with American Imperialism" echo through the "backyard" of the American Empire. The surging waves of Latin American student struggles fiercely impact the American Empire.

In recent times, the revolutionary student movements in more than ten countries in Latin America have risen to oppose American imperialism's aggression, the reactionary rule of their own ruling classes, and the corrupt bourgeois educational system. From Brazil in South America to El Salvador in Central America, from Uruguay on the Atlantic coast to Peru in the Andes, the shouts of "Down with American Imperialism" resonate everywhere.

In Brazil, following the large-scale anti-American and anti-dictatorship struggle that swept the nation in April, Brazilian students in early June staged a general strike in major cities such as Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Subsequently, anti-American and anti-dictatorship marches, demonstrations, and rallies erupted across the country. The development of this struggle was extremely rapid, expanding from a strike by over ten thousand university students to a massive demonstration involving teachers, artists, journalists, legislators, and other patriots, totaling one hundred thousand people. This was the largest mass struggle since the reactionary military coup in Brazil in 1964. In Argentina, student patriotic struggles have also intensified over the past few months. On June 14, major cities such as Buenos Aires, La Plata, and Tucumán saw the most intense student strikes and demonstrations since the pro-American dictator Onganía took power two years ago. By June 28, the second anniversary of Onganía's rule, students in many cities across the country, together with workers, held large-scale marches, demonstrations, and rallies. In Chile, after 8,000 university students at the Philosophy and Education Faculty of the University of Chile announced an indefinite strike on May 24, the struggle quickly spread from the capital Santiago to major ports like Valparaíso and important northern cities like Antofagasta, with the number of striking students increasing to over 30,000, making it one of the largest struggles in recent years. In Uruguay, since late May, students have been continuously striking and demonstrating to demand increased educational funding and oppose rising living costs. In Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, El Salvador, and other countries, similar large-scale student struggles have also occurred in recent times.

The current surging student movements in Latin America are directly targeting the common enemy of all peoples, American imperialism, their own reactionary rulers, and the corrupt bourgeois educational system.

In almost all the countries where struggles have erupted, students have raised slogans against American imperialism and their own reactionary rulers. The patriotic struggle of Brazilian students has been focused on opposing the so-called "cultural aid" agreement between the Brazilian Ministry of Culture and Education and the U.S. Agency for International Development. In every march and demonstration, students have shouted slogans such as "Down with American Imperialism!" "Down with the Dictatorship!" "Down with the Brazil-U.S. Agreement!" In El Salvador, Argentina, and Bolivia, demonstrators have shouted, "Yankees go home!" "Johnson go away!" "Down with the pro-American dictatorship!" "Death to the gorillas (extremely reactionary pro-American military personnel)!" In many countries, demonstrators have fiercely attacked American embassies, consulates, and Peace Corps offices, burning American flags and effigies symbolizing Americans. Brazilian students once smashed twenty-three large glass doors and windows at the American embassy, and Salvadoran students recently pelted the visiting American imperialist leader Johnson with eggs, tomatoes, and paint bottles.

Latin American revolutionary students, in their struggles, have upheld the glorious tradition of Latin American revolutionary youth daring to fight and daring to make revolution, increasingly adopting violent means to counter the brutal suppression by reactionary authorities. Some use stones and sticks as weapons, while others erect barricades in city centers using overturned cars and construction scaffolding. Some throw stones, glass bottles, and other objects from skyscrapers at the police, while others use homemade incendiary devices and explosives to retaliate against police, cavalry, and armored units. In many countries, students have engaged in fierce, tenacious, and prolonged battles with fully armed reactionary military and police forces, particularly in Brazil and Argentina under military dictatorship. Notably, in recent anti-American patriotic struggles, students in many countries, including Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia, have taken revolutionary actions to forcibly occupy university buildings and teaching halls, demanding the abolition of the corrupt educational system.

The reactionary forces in Latin America, terrified by the surging student movement, have intensified violent suppression and played political tricks to extinguish the flames of student struggles. In Brazil, where the student movement has been the most intense and prolonged, the reactionary authorities have taken measures such as "closing" and surrounding universities, deploying tens of thousands of military and police, using tear gas and poison gas, and even opening fire on students in bloody suppression. On the other hand, they hypocritically announced that the police should not interfere with student marches and demonstrations, and even used the appointment of a so-called "educational reform working group" to hold "talks" with students as a cover for political deception. However, revolutionary students have not been deceived; they resolutely refused to "talk" with the "working group" and openly called on all students to "take to the streets to counter suppression," clearly stating, "The Brazilian people can only answer violence with violence to win the anti-imperialist struggle." In other countries, reactionaries have also used revisionist elements to sabotage the student movement, but the treacherous actions of revisionists have been strongly condemned by students. The brave struggles of the broad masses of young students have received strong support from workers and progressive sectors of society.

Great Leader Chairman Mao said, "The student movement is a part of the entire people's movement. The surge in the student movement will inevitably promote the surge in the entire people's movement." The burgeoning student movement will further promote the anti-American patriotic struggles of the entire Latin American people. A more intense revolutionary storm is inevitably on the horizon.

    “打倒美帝国主义”的怒吼声响彻美帝“后院”
    拉美学生斗争怒涛汹涌猛烈冲击美帝
    各国革命学生敢于斗争、敢于革命，越来越采取暴力手段对付反动当局镇压；怒斥修正主义分子叛卖行径。学生斗争得到广大群众有力支持
    据新华社八日讯　本社记者报道：在美帝国主义的“后院”——拉丁美洲，蓬勃发展的革命学生运动，象大西洋的怒涛，汹涌澎湃，一浪高过一浪，正在猛烈地冲击着美帝国主义及其代理人的反动统治。
    拉丁美洲十多个国家的广大青年学生，为反对美帝国主义的侵略、反对本国统治集团的反动统治和腐朽的资产阶级教育制度，在最近一个时期相继展开了声势浩大的爱国正义斗争。从南美洲的巴西到中美洲的萨尔瓦多，从大西洋沿岸的乌拉圭到安第斯山脉的秘鲁，到处发出“打倒美帝国主义”的怒吼声。
    在巴西，继今年四月间在全国范围内开展大规模反美反独裁斗争后，巴西学生六月初又在里约热内卢、圣保罗等重要城市进行了总罢课。接着，学生的反美反独裁的游行示威和集会，此起彼伏，遍及全国各地。这场斗争的发展十分迅猛，从一万多名大学生的罢课扩展到包括教师、艺术家、新闻记者、议员和其他社会阶层的爱国者达十万人的声势浩大的游行示威。这是一九六四年巴西发生反动军事政变以来所爆发的规模最大的一次群众性斗争。在阿根廷，几个月来，学生的爱国斗争也急剧发展。六月十四日，布宜诺斯艾利斯、拉普拉塔、图库曼等重要城市爆发了自亲美独裁者翁加尼亚上台两年来最激烈的学生大罢课和示威游行。到六月二十八日翁加尼亚上台整两年这一天，全国各地许多城市广大学生，同工人一起又举行了规模巨大的游行示威和集会。在智利，智利大学哲学教育学院八千名大学生五月二十四日宣布不定期罢课后，几天之内，斗争浪潮从首都圣地亚哥扩大到智利主要港口瓦尔帕来索城和北部重要城市安托法加斯塔，罢课的学生增加到三万多人，其规模是近几年来少见的。在乌拉圭，从五月底以来，学生为要求增加教育经费、反对生活费用上涨而举行的罢课、游行示威的斗争也持续不断。在玻利维亚、哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔、委内瑞拉、秘鲁、萨尔瓦多等国家，最近一个时期也先后发生许多次从几千人到数万人的学生斗争。
    目前正在蓬勃发展的拉丁美洲学生运动的斗争矛头，直接指向全世界人民的公敌美帝国主义和本国反动统治以及腐朽的资产阶级教育制度。
    几乎在所有爆发斗争的国家中，学生们都提出了反对美帝国主义和本国反动统治的口号。巴西学生的爱国正义斗争，最近一年多来一直是围绕着反对巴西文化教育部同美国国际开发署签订的所谓文化“援助”协定展开的。在每次游行示威中，学生们都高呼“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒独裁统治！”“打倒巴美协定！”等口号。在萨尔瓦多、阿根廷、玻利维亚，示威学生高呼“美国佬滚回去！”“约翰逊滚开！”“打倒亲美独裁统治！”“大猩猩分子（极端反动的亲美军人）该死！”特别是，在许多国家示威群众猛烈袭击美国大使馆、领事馆和美国“和平队”办公室等，焚烧美国星条旗和象征美国佬的摹拟人像。巴西学生有一次捣毁了美国大使馆二十三扇大玻璃门窗，萨尔瓦多的学生最近用鸡蛋、西红柿和油漆瓶痛击了前去萨尔瓦多活动的美帝国主义头子约翰逊。
    拉丁美洲各国革命学生在斗争中，发扬了拉丁美洲革命青年敢于斗争、敢于革命的光荣传统，越来越采用激烈的暴力手段来对付反动当局的残暴镇压。他们有的用石头、木棍作武器，有的在市中心大街上用翻倒的汽车和建筑脚手架等筑起了街垒；有的从摩天大楼上向警察猛烈投掷石头、玻璃瓶子等各种物品；有的用土制燃烧弹等爆炸物，回击警察、骑兵、装甲部队的攻击。在许多国家，学生们都同全副武装的反动军警展开了激烈、顽强、持久的搏斗，在军事独裁残酷统治的巴西、阿根廷，尤为突出。值得指出的是，在最近的反美爱国斗争中，巴西、智利、阿根廷、委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚等许多国家的学生还采取了强行占领大学校舍和教学大楼的造反行动，要求废除腐朽的教育制度。
    被这场汹涌澎湃的学生运动吓破了胆的拉丁美洲各国反动派，为扑灭学生斗争的烈火，极力加紧暴力镇压和玩弄政治诱骗的反革命花招。在学生运动最为激烈、持续时间最长的巴西，反动当局一方面采取“封闭”和包围大学的措施，出动成千上万的军警，使用催泪弹、毒气，甚至开枪对学生进行血腥镇压；另一方面假惺惺地宣布警察不要干预学生游行示威，甚至以任命所谓“教育改革工作小组”同学生举行“会谈”为幌子，来进行政治诱骗。但是，革命学生并没有上当，他们坚决拒绝同“工作小组”“会谈”；同时公开号召广大学生“上街对付镇压”，并且明确指出：“巴西人民只有用暴力回答暴力才能赢得反帝斗争。”在其他国家，反动派还利用修正主义分子对学生运动进行破坏，但是，修正主义分子的叛卖行径遭到了学生的强烈斥责。广大青年学生的英勇斗争得到了广大工人和社会各进步阶层的有力声援。
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“学生运动是整个人民运动的一部分。学生运动的高涨，不可避免地要促进整个人民运动的高涨。”方兴未艾的学生运动必将进一步促进整个拉丁美洲人民的反美爱国斗争。一场更为激烈的革命风暴，必将到来。
