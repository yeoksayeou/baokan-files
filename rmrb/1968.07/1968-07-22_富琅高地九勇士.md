Nine soldiers of the Laos People's Liberation Army in Xieng Ngeun Province bravely fought in a recent battle, swiftly defeating two enemy companies and foiling the enemy's plot to retake Phulang Heights. Their actions were crucial in the victory of capturing the enemy's Baty stronghold.

Phulang Heights is located to the northeast of the Baty enemy stronghold in Xieng Ngeun Province and is a key defensive position for the enemy. On February 28, the Laos People's Liberation Army launched a fierce attack and captured Phulang Heights, opening an important gap for the assault on the Baty stronghold. However, the enemy, unwilling to accept defeat, tried every means to counterattack, attempting to retake Phulang Heights.

	Accepting the Glorious Mission: Bravely and Intelligently Scouting

A squad led by Tongten, consisting of nine soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, was honored with the mission of defending Phulang Heights. Upon arriving at Phulang Heights, they discovered that the enemy had secretly infiltrated Hill 1 and Hill 2, about one kilometer away, intending to use these hills as a springboard to counterattack Phulang.

	To understand the enemy's situation and effectively strike them, Tongten and two other comrades cleverly crawled towards the enemy's position for reconnaissance. Under the cover of dense trees, they observed that the enemy had two companies of troops stationed on two nearby hills. The enemy command post was set up on Hill 1.

	Upon returning from the reconnaissance, Tongten immediately convened a meeting for the entire squad to discuss the enemy's situation and plan their strategy. At the meeting, the soldiers unanimously agreed to resolutely complete the mission of defending Phulang Heights. The soldiers pointed out that although the enemy was numerous, their morale was extremely low after suffering a heavy defeat. If they were struck with a sudden and heavy blow before they could regain their footing, victory would be certain.

	After the discussion, the soldiers were eager and spirited. On March 4 at noon, the squad split into three groups and silently advanced towards Hill 1. Tongten's group directly infiltrated the enemy's command post, lying in ambush just 15 meters away from the enemy command center. The other two groups also pressed close to the enemy, forming an ambush circle.

	Seizing the Opportunity to Charge into the Enemy's Camp: Daring to Fight Hand-to-Hand

	The battle was about to begin, but the foolish enemy was still unaware.

	Suddenly, Tongten gave the order to attack. Instantly, the nine soldiers from different directions simultaneously concentrated their fire on the enemy command post, firing round after round of bullets filled with hatred and throwing grenade after grenade. The unprepared enemy soldiers were caught off guard and immediately fell into chaos. The Liberation Army soldiers seized the opportunity to charge into the enemy's camp, using bayonets to engage in hand-to-hand combat. After just a few minutes of intense fighting, the Liberation Army soldiers had eliminated 18 enemy soldiers.

	Unable to withstand the fierce attack of the Liberation Army, the enemy was forced to abandon Hill 1 and retreat to Hill 2, attempting to make a last stand. However, the nine soldiers of the Liberation Army fought even more bravely, pursuing the enemy and driving them back step by step until they were forced to abandon Hill 2 and flee in disarray. Thus, in a situation where the enemy outnumbered them, the nine brave soldiers successfully completed the task of defending Phulang Heights, paving the way for the main force to capture the Baty stronghold.

	Soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the Laos People's Liberation Army are seizing the time to train actively, preparing to annihilate the enemy at any moment.

    富琅高地九勇士
    老挝桑怒省的九名解放军战士，在不久前的一次战斗中，发扬勇敢精神，在短时间内就击溃了两个连的敌人，粉碎了敌人重占富琅高地的阴谋，为取得攻克敌人巴提据点群的胜利作出了重要贡献。
    富琅高地位于桑怒省巴提敌军据点群的东北面，是敌人的一个重要防御据点。二月二十八日，老挝人民解放军以凌厉的攻势，一举攻克富琅高地，为进攻巴提据点群打开了一个重要的缺口。但不甘心失败的敌人千方百计地进行反扑，妄图夺回富琅高地。
    接受光荣任务  勇敢机智侦察
    由通腾率领的一个班，共九名人民解放军战士，光荣地接受了守卫富琅高地的任务。可是，他们来到富琅高地后，发现敌军已经偷偷潜入离他们约一公里的一号和二号高地，企图以这两个高地作跳板，向富琅进行反扑。
    为了弄清敌人的情况和有效地打击敌人，通腾和其他两个战友机智地爬向敌人阵地进行侦察。在茂密的树林的掩护下，他们观察到敌人有两个连的兵力，分驻在相距不远的两个高地上。敌军指挥部设在一号高地上。
    侦察回来，通腾立刻召开全班会议，介绍敌军情况和研究作战计划。会上，战士们一致表示：坚决完成守卫富琅高地的任务。战士们指出，敌人虽然多，但是他们遭到惨败后，士气极度低落，在他们尚未站稳脚跟的时候，再给他们以出奇不意的、沉重的打击，一定会取得胜利。
    经过讨论，战士们个个摩拳擦掌，斗志昂扬。三月四日中午，全班分成三个小组，悄悄地向一号高地进发。通腾率领的小组直插敌人心脏，在离敌军指挥所十五米的地方埋伏下来，其他两个组，也紧逼敌人，形成了一个伏击圈。
    乘机猛插敌阵  敢于刺刀见红
    一场激烈的战斗就要开始了，可是愚蠢的敌人，还蒙在鼓里一无所知。
    突然，通腾发出了进攻令。霎时，九名战士从不同方向同时集中火力向敌军指挥所射出了一排排仇恨的子弹，投出了一颗颗手榴弹。毫无防备的敌军官兵被打得蒙头转向，顿时乱作一团。解放军战士乘机猛插敌阵，用刺刀同敌人展开肉搏战，仅经过几分钟的激战，解放军战士就消灭十八名敌人。
    敌人无法抵抗解放军的猛烈进攻，被迫放弃一号高地，退守二号高地，企图负隅顽抗。但是，九名解放军战士越打越勇，乘胜追击，把敌人打得屁滚尿流，节节后退，最后不得不放弃二号高地狼狈逃窜了。这样，在敌众我寡的情况下，九名勇敢的战士出色地完成了保卫富琅高地的任务，为大部队攻占巴提据点群开辟了胜利的道路。（新华社）（附图片）
