The Anhui Provincial Revolutionary Committees have emphasized the establishment and improvement of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, enhancing the class struggle consciousness and two-line struggle awareness of the broad revolutionary masses, promoting revolutionary criticism, and further developing the excellent situation.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hefei, Anhui Province, the revolutionary committees at all levels have, by focusing on the establishment and improvement of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, enhanced the class struggle consciousness and two-line struggle awareness of the broad revolutionary masses, promoted revolutionary criticism, and further developed the excellent situation.

Currently, from urban areas to rural areas, from factories and mines to fields, from offices to schools, various industries across the province have established various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, which have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. So far, the province has held over 300,000 sessions of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 12 million participants, accounting for more than one-third of the province's population.

Work is complex and varied, and the fundamental issue must be grasped firmly. After the establishment of the revolutionary committees at all levels, they have all placed the establishment and improvement of Mao Zedong Thought study classes at the top of all work. The first major task after the establishment of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee was to focus on the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. All members of the Standing Committee and the Committee, in addition to leading by example in the practice of struggle by studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, have devoted their main energy to running the study classes well. Two months after the establishment of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the province had already held 97,000 sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with 4,179,000 participants.

Through the mass movement of establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, various places have further implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, making Mao Zedong Thought widely known, making Chairman Mao's revolutionary line deeply rooted in people's hearts, and bringing about tremendous changes in people's spiritual outlook. The Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Shanjiao Brigade of Xinyang Commune in Chao County are numerous and well-run. Through the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, the brigade has changed its ideology and transformed its land, greatly improving the rural landscape. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants all care about the collective. They say, "We do not believe in heaven, we do not believe in earth, we only believe in the great Mao Zedong Thought!"

Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes held across the province all take class struggle as the key, combining the actual class struggle in their respective regions and units, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's great teachings on class struggle and class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat, criticizing and repudiating revisionism, carrying out revolutionary criticism, and fundamentally enhancing the class struggle and two-line struggle awareness of the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. The Revolutionary Committee of Suzhou Prefecture held a study class for direct-organization cadres, taking class struggle as the key, closely combining the actual class struggle in the region, keeping up with the situation, and focusing on revolutionary criticism. The study class has become a battlefield for launching a fierce attack on class enemies, effectively exposing and striking down a handful of class enemies, promoting revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination, and developing the excellent situation.

"Without correct political views, one is like a soul-less body." The study classes held in various places all regard being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as the soul of running the study classes well, guiding everything, directing everything, and promoting everything. The broad revolutionary workers of Huainan Coal Mine, through studying in the study classes, have greatly enhanced their class struggle consciousness and two-line struggle awareness. With their loyal hearts to the great leader Chairman Mao, they created a high-yield record of 53,004 tons of coal per day in the high-yield coal production battle on May 25. The broad miners proudly said: Being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao means having boundless power, being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao means being invincible in battle!

    安徽各级革委会大办毛泽东思想学习班
    学习班以阶级斗争为纲，结合本地区、本单位的阶级斗争的实际，开展革命大批判，进一步发展了大好形势
    据新华社合肥电　安徽省各级革命委员会通过狠抓大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟，推动了革命大批判，进一步发展了大好形势。
    现在，全省从城镇到农村，从工厂、矿山到田头、地头，从机关到学校，各行各业举办的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班犹如雨后春笋，红花遍地。到目前为止，全省已办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班三十多万期，有一千二百多万人次参加了学习，占全省人口三分之一以上。
    工作千头万绪，必须狠抓根本。各级革命委员会成立以后，都把大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，摆在一切工作的首位。省革命委员会成立以后第一件大事，就是狠抓大办毛泽东思想学习班。全体常委、委员，除了以身作则在斗争实践中活学活用毛泽东思想以外，都把主要精力放在办好学习班上。省革命委员会成立后两个月，全省就办起毛泽东思想学习班九万七千多期，有四百一十七万九千多人参加了学习。
    各地通过大办毛泽东思想学习班的群众运动，进一步落实了毛主席的一系列最新指示，使毛泽东思想得到空前大普及，使毛主席的革命路线更加深入人心，人们的精神面貌发生了巨大的变化。巢县烔炀公社山桥大队毛泽东思想学习班办得多、办得好，通过活学活用毛主席著作，人换思想，地换装，农村面貌大变样，广大贫下中农人人关心集体。他们说，我们天不信、地不信，就信伟大的毛泽东思想！
    全省各地举办的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，都以阶级斗争为纲，结合本地区、本单位的阶级斗争的实际，活学活用毛主席关于无产阶级专政下阶级和阶级斗争的伟大教导，斗私批修，开展革命大批判，从根本上提高了广大革命群众、革命干部的阶级斗争觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。宿县专区革命委员会举办的专直机关干部学习班，以阶级斗争为纲，密切结合本地区的阶级斗争实际，紧跟形势，狠抓革命大批判，把学习班办成了向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻的战场，有力地揭露和打击了一小撮阶级敌人，促进了革命大联合和革命三结合，发展了大好形势。
      “没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”各地举办的学习班，都把无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，作为办好学习班的灵魂，统帅一切，指挥一切，推动一切。淮南煤矿广大革命职工通过在学习班学习，阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心，在五月二十五日高产夺煤大战中，创造了日产煤炭五万三千零四吨的高产纪录。广大矿工豪迈地说：无限忠于毛主席就力量无穷，无限忠于毛主席就战无不胜！
