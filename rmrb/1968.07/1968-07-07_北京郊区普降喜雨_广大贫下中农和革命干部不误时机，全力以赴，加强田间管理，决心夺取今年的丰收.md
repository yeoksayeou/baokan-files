Heavy rain fell in the suburbs of Beijing from the evening of the 5th to the morning of the 6th. After the rain, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in severely drought-affected areas immediately sprang into action. They rushed to sow seeds in the few fields that had not yet been planted, filling in gaps where seedlings were missing. In most areas, they are now fertilizing the young seedlings and strengthening field management, determined to achieve a bumper harvest this year.

Since last winter, the suburbs of Beijing have seen little rain or snow, and the severe drought has continued to worsen, seriously threatening this year's spring planting. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the suburbs, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have displayed a dauntless revolutionary spirit and risen to the challenge of fighting the drought. In the severely drought-affected mountainous areas, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have carried water to plant seeds, overcoming all difficulties to secure a lush crop of seedlings. This recent heavy rain is very beneficial for the growth of the seedlings. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres are seizing the opportunity and sparing no effort to strengthen field management, determined to achieve a bumper harvest this year.
