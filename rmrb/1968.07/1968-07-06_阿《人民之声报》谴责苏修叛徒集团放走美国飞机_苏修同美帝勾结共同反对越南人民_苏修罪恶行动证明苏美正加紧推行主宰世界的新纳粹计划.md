	Albanian "People's Voice" Newspaper Condemns Soviet Revisionist Traitor Group for Releasing American Aircraft
	Soviet Revisionists Collude with U.S. Imperialists to Oppose the Vietnamese People
	Soviet Revisionist Evil Deeds Prove that the Soviet Union and the U.S. Are Hurrying to Implement a New Nazi Plan to Dominate the World

	Tirana, July 4 -- The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published a commentary today exposing and condemning the Soviet revisionist traitor group for releasing an American aircraft carrying U.S. troops invading Vietnam. The commentary pointed out that this incident once again proves that the Soviet revisionist group verbally opposes imperialism but in practice colludes with U.S. imperialism to oppose the Vietnamese people.

	The commentary pointed out that an American aircraft fully loaded with U.S. invading troops, when flying over Soviet airspace, was forced to land. By rights, this aircraft, loaded with American invading bandits, should have been detained and punished. However, under the direct orders of Moscow, this American aircraft was not touched at all and continued to fly to South Vietnam to massacre the Vietnamese people.

	The commentary pointed out that Moscow has long been engaged in various deceptive propaganda on the Vietnam issue. However, in this incident, the Soviet revisionist group remained silent and once again concealed their crimes from the Soviet people. This is another new account in their history of counter-revolutionary collusion with the United States.

	The commentary said that after Moscow and Washington just signed the infamous "Non-Proliferation Treaty," the Soviet revisionists quickly released this American aircraft. This once again proves that the "two superpowers" of the Soviet Union and the United States are hurrying to implement their new Nazi plan to dominate the world.

    阿《人民之声报》谴责苏修叛徒集团放走美国飞机
    苏修同美帝勾结共同反对越南人民
    苏修罪恶行动证明苏美正加紧推行主宰世界的新纳粹计划
    新华社地拉那四日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》四日发表评论，揭露和谴责苏修叛徒集团放走美国运载侵越美军的强盗飞机，并指出，这一事件再次证明苏修集团口头上反帝，但在行动上则同美帝合作、反对越南人民。
    评论指出，一架满载美国侵略军飞往南越的美国飞机，经过苏联领空时被迫降落。按理说，这架载满了美国侵略强盗的飞机应当受到扣留和惩罚。但是在莫斯科的直接指使下，这架美国飞机竟没有被触动一根毫毛，继续飞往越南南方去屠杀越南人民。
    评论指出，莫斯科在越南问题上一贯进行种种欺骗宣传。然而，在这一次事件中，苏修集团一声不吭，向苏联人民又一次隐瞒了他们的罪行。这是他们在同美国进行反革命勾结的历史上记下的又一笔新账。
    评论说，在莫斯科和华盛顿刚刚在臭名昭著的“防止核扩散条约”上签字划押之后，苏修迅速释放了这架美国飞机，这就再一次证明了苏美“两大国”正在加紧推行它们的主宰世界的新纳粹计划。
