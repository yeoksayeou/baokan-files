	France Borrows from Foreign Banks to Prop Up Franc

	The massive and prolonged revolutionary mass movement that erupted in France in May and June of this year is unprecedented in French history. This great revolutionary mass movement has dealt a severe blow to French monopoly capitalism, causing the relatively stable franc in the Western world to waver.

	To maintain the franc's position, the Bank of France announced on the 10th that it had signed a short-term loan agreement totaling $1.3 billion with six foreign banks to support the increasingly unstable franc.

	British Government Owes $29.47 Billion in Foreign Debt

	The British imperialists, beset by internal and external troubles, have long relied on borrowing to make ends meet. This reflects their deteriorating financial and economic situation, which is becoming increasingly severe.

	According to recent revelations by the British "Daily Telegraph," "Britain now owes too much debt" and the figures are staggering. It states that from 1954 to the present, Britain's foreign debt has reached 29.47 billion pounds, with more than half of this amount owed to the United States, totaling 17.18 billion pounds.

	U.S. Budget Deficit Reaches $25 Billion

	In the fiscal year ending June 30, 1967-1968, the U.S. budget deficit reached $25 billion. This is the fourth-largest budget deficit in U.S. history, trailing only the years 1941, 1942, and 1943 during World War II.

	The escalating costs of the Vietnam War are the primary cause of the massive budget deficit last year. It is estimated that the U.S. is currently spending $40 billion directly on the Vietnam War.

	Indonesian Lackeys Rush to Sell Out, U.S. Masters Generously Reward

	The fascist military regime in Indonesia, in an attempt to maintain its crumbling economy, is hurriedly selling out the country to beg for more "aid" from imperialism. Recently, it has let the wolf into the house by allowing five foreign banks to operate in Indonesia. These banks are the First National City Bank of New York, Chase Manhattan Bank, American Express Company, and Bank of America, among others.

	After the Indonesian reactionaries opened their doors wide to imperialism, the U.S. master rewarded the Indonesian lackeys with a handsome sum. It is revealed that eight U.S. banks have recently decided to provide Indonesia with a $30 million loan to help purchase rice, in an attempt to alleviate the severe food shortages in Indonesia.

    今年五、六月份在法国爆发的革命群众运动，其规模之大，时间之长，在法国历史上是从未有过的。这场伟大的革命群众运动给法国垄断资本经济以极其沉重的打击，使在西方世界中地位比较稳固的法郎发生了动摇。

    英国政府现欠外债二十九亿多英镑
    处于内外交困的英帝国主义，长期来一直靠借债过日子。这也反映了它的财政经济情况江河日下，日益严重。

    侵越战费不断扩大是造成上年度巨额预算亏空的首要原因。据估计，目前美国直接用于侵越战争的开支已达四百亿美元的规模。

    在印尼反动派向帝国主义大开门户之后，美帝主子又给印尼奴才一笔犒赏。据透露，美国八家银行最近决定向印尼提供三千万美元贷款，以帮助印尼购买大米，妄图解救印尼国内严重粮荒。
