Members of the revolutionary committees at various levels in Tianjin's Hongqiao District have followed Chairman Mao's instructions to take root among the masses, intensify class struggle, consult the masses on every matter, willingly accept supervision from the masses, promptly summarize and promote the advanced experiences of the masses, and enthusiastically support new things. They are increasingly winning the support of the revolutionary masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin: With the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist troops, the revolutionary committees at various levels in Tianjin's Hongqiao District have carried forward the party's glorious revolutionary traditions, maintained close ties with the broad masses of the people, and rooted all work firmly among the masses. They have fully achieved the goals of believing in the masses, relying on the masses, representing the masses, and serving the masses. They have continuously demonstrated great power in class struggle and are increasingly winning the support and love of the broad masses.

To the Stormy Seas of Class Struggle

After the revolutionary committees at various levels in Hongqiao District were born in the stormy seas of class struggle, a crucial issue they faced was where to set up their command posts: whether to control from the office or to go to the front lines of class struggle and lead the broad revolutionary masses in actively attacking the class enemy.

In late 1967, during the initial period after the district revolutionary committee was established, the committee members were busy receiving visiting masses and handling daily work. Soon, the masses sharply criticized this approach, saying, "The committee members have all become receptionists!" The masses' criticism drew great attention. With the help of the leftist troops, the revolutionary committee took up this issue and conducted a rectification campaign. They reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings, "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and work together with the masses to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better," and recalled the serious lessons of the old bureaucracy's detachment from the masses. They decided to immediately divide the entire district into four major battle zones: industry, commerce, education, streets, and offices. Forty-three committee members, except for one standing committee member on duty in the office, all went deep into various battle zones, choosing the most acute and complex places for class struggle to set up their posts. On the front lines of class struggle, they served both as commanders and fighters.

In one street area, due to the deception of the class enemy, a portion of the masses were misled and divided, making the class struggle situation very complex. Vice Chairman of the district revolutionary committee and revolutionary leader Gao Lianrui, along with committee member and military representative Zhao Fuchang, carried Chairman Mao's revolutionary books and shouldered their luggage, coming here. They tirelessly visited every household, propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and mobilized the masses street by street. They did painstaking and meticulous ideological work with the misled masses, helping them raise their proletarian consciousness and quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They united all possible revolutionary forces, isolated and struck down a handful of class enemies, and quickly achieved revolutionary unity. All four streets in the area established revolutionary committees. Immediately, they helped the street revolutionary committees to press on and root out the deeply hidden remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries one by one. At the same time, other committee members of the district revolutionary committee were also fighting on the front lines with the broad revolutionary masses, actively launching attacks on the class enemy, fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and quickly establishing revolutionary committees in more than five hundred and forty grassroots units, making Hongqiao District the first in Tianjin to achieve a "red" district.

After the establishment of the grassroots revolutionary committees, with the help of the leftist troops and the leadership of the district revolutionary committee, the committee members also left their offices and went deep into the factories, workshops, and teams to seriously investigate and study the new characteristics, situations, and trends of class struggle, firmly grasping the initiative in class struggle, and making the newly born revolutionary committees into vigorous class struggle command posts.

Humbly Learning from the Masses

In the joint struggle with the masses, should one issue orders and commands, or should one humble oneself and become a student of the masses? The revolutionary committees at various levels in Hongqiao District have always regarded the correct attitude towards this issue as a fundamental attitude towards the masses and a fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Members of the revolutionary committees at various levels have always remembered Chairman Mao's teaching, "Only by representing the masses can one educate the masses, and only by being a student of the masses can one be a teacher of the masses." They have insisted on eating, living, working, studying, and fighting together with the masses, humbly listening to the masses' opinions, and achieving the goal of coming from the masses and going to the masses. At every critical moment of following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, they have promptly summarized the advanced experiences of the masses and promoted them. In the past half year, the district revolutionary committee has established sixteen advanced examples, including those who overcame the influence of bourgeois factionalism and achieved revolutionary unity; those who held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes and carried out sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism; those who strictly distinguished between the two types of contradictions and did a good job in cleaning up the class ranks; and those who grasped revolution and promoted production. The promotion of these advanced examples has strongly promoted the vigorous development of various work.

With the help of the military leftist personnel, the grassroots revolutionary committees have also taken the district revolutionary committee as an example and seriously insisted on the mass line. The committee members have always appeared in the attitude of a student, consulted the masses on every matter, concentrated the wisdom of the masses, formed correct leadership opinions, and turned them into the conscious actions of the masses.

Fully Supporting New Things

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great socialist enthusiasm hidden among the masses has been fully unleashed, and new things have emerged like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. In the process of deepening into the masses, the members of the revolutionary committees at various levels in Hongqiao District have regarded discovering the masses' enthusiasm and creativity and fully supporting new things as their important responsibilities.

At the graduation of the district's Mao Zedong Thought study class, some workers proposed, "The study class can graduate, but the mutual aid relationship of the study groups cannot end." They spontaneously organized a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda network based on the original study groups. The brother factories helped each other and promoted each other in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, carrying out political cooperation. Vice Chairman of the district revolutionary committee and the responsible person of the leftist troops, Comrade Wang Runtian, discovered this new thing and believed it to be a product of the proletarian "public" spirit shining with the light of Mao Zedong Thought. He firmly supported it and enthusiastically helped the masses summarize their experiences, making it continuously enriched, perfected, and grown in actual struggles. Through vigorous promotion, this new thing quickly blossomed and bore fruit throughout the district. The propaganda network showed strong vitality in implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on achieving revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, and carrying out revolutionary criticism. In the industrial sixth district, six small factories formed a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda network. This network, in the struggle against the enemy, learned from each other's experiences; when one factory had difficulties, all factories helped; when encountering difficult problems, they jointly "diagnosed" and solved them, complementing each other's strengths and weaknesses, and promoting each other. The Red Rock Plastic Factory was the first to expose a cunning class enemy, and the propaganda network immediately held a struggle meeting attended by all revolutionary workers from various factories, pushing the brother factories to further expose their own class struggle. The work of uniting and winning over the deceived masses in the Oil Paste Factory was not done well, so the propaganda network helped them study Chairman Mao's teachings and invited the Red First Shoe Factory and Dongfeng Printing Factory, which did a good job in solving this problem, to provide specific help. The comrades in the Oil Paste Factory quickly raised their awareness and firmly grasped the direction of the struggle.

Always Placing Oneself Under the Supervision of the Masses

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, "The most fundamental aspect of reforming state organs is to connect with the masses." The revolutionary committees at various levels in Hongqiao District have deeply felt in practice that voluntarily placing oneself under the supervision of the masses and humbly listening to the masses' criticisms is an important guarantee for the revolutionization of the leadership cadre. With the help of the military leftist personnel, the district revolutionary committee has formulated a set of systems for accepting the supervision of the masses and formed a good tradition of humbly accepting the supervision of the masses.

They have voluntarily accepted the supervision of the masses through three channels: The first channel is to frequently listen to the opinions of the staff of the revolutionary committee office. The leading members of the revolutionary committee have, through holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, convening symposiums, and visiting families on holidays, broadly listened to criticisms. The second channel is for the committee members to participate in the grassroots activities of learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, take the lead in exposing and criticizing their own shortcomings, and ask the masses for criticism and supervision. In the process of working and fighting with the masses, they have always sought the opinions of old workers, revolutionary youngsters, street revolutionary residents, and masses from all sides. The third channel is to fully play the supervisory role of revolutionary mass organizations. They often invite the responsible persons of the workers' congress, the revolutionary committees, and other revolutionary mass organizations to hold symposiums, seek opinions, and listen to criticisms. The district revolutionary committee has also taken measures to play the role of revolutionary mass organizations: Before the revolutionary committee makes any major decision, it always notifies the revolutionary mass organizations in advance, fully discusses and deliberates, and then forms a decision based on everyone's opinions; it holds an expanded meeting of the revolutionary committee with the participation of the responsible persons of the revolutionary mass organizations every month, where the standing committee reports on the work and listens to everyone's criticisms; it conducts a rectification campaign every quarter, fully practices democracy, and broadly listens to the opinions of the revolutionary mass organizations.

With the help of the military leftist personnel, the grassroots revolutionary committees have also striven to voluntarily accept the supervision of the masses, taking the masses' criticisms as the driving force for progress.

The revolutionary committees at various levels in Hongqiao District have established a close relationship with the masses, greatly mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses. The fire of revolutionary criticism burns more fiercely, and production reports come frequently. The entire district presents a prosperous revolutionary scene.

    发扬党的光荣传统　永远和群众血肉相联
    天津红桥区各级革命委员会成员，遵循毛主席的教导，扎根基层，狠抓阶级斗争，遇事向群众请教，自觉地接受群众监督，及时总结推广群众先进经验，热情支持新生事物，越来越受到革命群众的拥护
    新华社天津电　天津市红桥区各级革命委员会在人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，发扬党的光荣革命传统，和广大人民群众保持血肉联系，把各项工作牢固地扎根于群众之中，充分做到相信群众，依靠群众，代表群众，为了群众，不断地在阶级斗争中发挥出强大的威力，越来越受到广大群众的拥护和爱戴。
        到阶级斗争的大风大浪中去
    红桥区各级革命委员会在阶级斗争的暴风雨中诞生以后，面临的一个重要问题是把指挥部设在哪里，是设在机关遥控指挥，还是到阶级斗争的大风大浪中去带领广大革命群众主动向阶级敌人进攻。
    去年年底，区革委会刚成立的一段时间内，委员们整天忙于接待来访群众和处理日常工作。不久，群众就对这种做法提出了尖锐批评，说：“革委会委员都成了接待员啦！”群众的批评，引起了他们的极大重视。在支左部队的帮助下，革委会带着这个问题，进行了整风。大家重温了伟大导师毛主席“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的亲切教导，回顾了旧机关脱离群众的严重教训，决定立即把全区划分为工业、财贸文教、街道、机关四大战区，四十三名委员除留一名常委在机关值班外，全部深入到各个战区，选择阶级斗争最尖锐、最复杂的地方蹲点。在阶级斗争的火线上，既当指挥员，又当战斗员。
    街道一片，由于阶级敌人蒙蔽了一部分群众，在群众中制造分裂，阶级斗争的形势非常复杂。区革委会副主任、革命领导干部高连瑞和革委会委员、军队代表赵福昌怀揣毛主席的革命宝书，肩扛行李，来到这里。他们不辞劳苦，走家串户，宣传毛泽东思想，挨街逐巷地发动群众。他们和广大革命群众一道，对受蒙蔽的群众作艰苦细致的思想工作，帮助他们提高无产阶级觉悟，迅速回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，团结了一切可以团结的革命力量，孤立和打击了一小撮阶级敌人，迅速促成革命的大联合，全片四条街都建立了革命委员会。紧接着，他们又帮助街道革命委员会乘胜追击，把隐藏得很深的一小撮国民党反动派残渣余孽一个个地揪了出来。与此同时，区革委会的其他委员也都在第一线同广大革命群众并肩战斗，主动地向阶级敌人发起猛攻，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，使五百四十多个基层单位迅速成立了革命委员会，在天津市区第一个实现了全区一片红。
    各基层革委会诞生以后，在支左部队的帮助下和区革委会的带动下，革委会成员也纷纷走出办公室，深入到工厂车间班组，认真调查研究阶级斗争的新特点、新情况、新动向，牢牢掌握阶级斗争的主动权，使新生的革命委员会成为朝气蓬勃的阶级斗争指挥部。
        恭恭敬敬地当群众的小学生
    在和群众的共同战斗中，是指手划脚，发号施令，还是放下架子，甘当群众的小学生？红桥区各级革命委员会始终把正确对待这个问题，看作是对待群众的根本态度问题，是对待毛主席无产阶级革命路线的根本态度问题。
    各级革委会成员牢记毛主席“只有代表群众才能教育群众，只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生”的伟大教导，坚持和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同战斗，虚心倾听群众意见，做到从群众中来，到群众中去。在紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的每个关键时刻，他们都及时总结群众的先进经验，加以推广。半年来，区革委会先后树立了十六个先进典型，其中有克服资产阶级派性影响，实现革命大联合的典型；有大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，持久深入地开展革命大批判的典型；有严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，搞好清理阶级队伍工作的典型；有抓革命，促生产的典型，等等。这些先进典型的推广，有力地促进了各项工作蓬蓬勃勃地向前发展。
    各基层革命委员会在解放军支左人员的帮助下，也都以区革委会为榜样，认真坚持群众路线。革委会成员处处以小学生的姿态出现，事事向群众请教，集中群众的智慧，形成正确的领导意见，并把它变为群众的自觉行动。
      满腔热情地支持新生事物
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，群众中蕴藏着的极大的社会主义积极性充分发挥出来，新生事物象雨后春笋般地出现。在深入群众的过程中，红桥区各级革委会成员把善于发现群众的积极性和创造性，满腔热情地支持新生事物，当作自己的重要职责。
    在区办毛泽东思想学习班结业的时候，一些工人提出：“学习班可以结业，学习小组的互助关系不能结束。”他们自动组织起以原学习小组为基础的毛泽东思想宣传网，各兄弟厂之间在落实毛主席的最新指示上，互相帮助，互相促进，开展政治大协作。区革委会副主任、支左部队负责人汪润田同志发现这一新生事物，认为这是闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的无产阶级“公”字的产物，坚决予以支持，并且满腔热情地帮助群众总结经验，使它在实际斗争中不断充实、完善，茁壮成长。经过大力推广，这一新生事物迅速在全区开花、结果。宣传网在落实毛主席关于实现革命大联合和革命三结合，开展革命大批判等一系列最新指示的过程中，显示出了强大的生命力。工业六片有六个小厂结成了一个毛泽东思想宣传网。这个宣传网在对敌斗争中，一厂有经验，大家来学习；一厂有困难，各厂来帮助；遇到疑难问题，大家联合“会诊”，全力解决，取长补短，互相带动。红岩塑料厂第一个揪出了一个狡猾的阶级敌人，宣传网里立即召开有各厂全体革命职工参加的批斗大会，推动兄弟厂进一步揭开了本厂阶级斗争的盖子。油灰厂团结、争取受蒙蔽群众的工作做得不很好，宣传网里就帮助他们学习毛主席的教导，并请解决这个问题较好的红一便鞋厂和东风制本厂去具体帮助，使油灰厂的同志迅速提高认识，牢牢掌握了斗争大方向。
      永远把自己置于群众的监督之下
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”红桥区各级革命委员会在实践中深深体会到，自觉地把自己置于群众的监督之下，虚心听取群众的批评，是实现领导班子革命化的重要保证。区革委会在解放军支左人员的帮助下，制定了一套接受群众监督的制度，形成了虚心接受群众监督的良好风尚。
    他们通过三条渠道自觉地接受群众的监督：第一条渠道是经常听取革委会机关工作人员的意见。革委会领导成员通过办毛泽东思想学习班，召开座谈会，以及假日进行家庭访问等办法，广泛听取批评。第二条渠道是革委会成员在基层参加活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会，带头亮私斗私，请群众批评监督。在和群众同劳动、同战斗的过程中，随时随地征求老工人、革命小将、街道革命居民等各方面群众的意见。第三条渠道是充分发挥革命群众组织的监督作用。他们经常邀请工代会、红代会等革命群众组织的负责人举行座谈，征求意见，听取批评。区革委会还采取了发挥革命群众组织作用的措施：在革委会每次作出重大决议之前，总是事先通知革命群众组织，充分酝酿和讨论，然后集中大家的意见形成决议；每月召开有革命群众组织负责人参加的革委会委员扩大会议，由常委汇报工作，听取大家的批评；每个季度革委会进行一次整风，充分发扬民主，广泛听取革命群众组织的意见。
    各基层革委会在解放军支左人员的帮助下，也都象区革委会那样，努力做到自觉地接受群众监督，把群众的批评作为前进的动力。
    红桥区各级革命委员会和群众建立了鱼水相依的亲密关系，极大地调动了广大革命群众的积极性，革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺，生产捷报频传，全区到处呈现出一派欣欣向荣的革命景象。
