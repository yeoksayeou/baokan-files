For the revolution, head to the mountains and countryside. The Beijing group of young intellectuals heading to the countryside.

"Chinese Khrushchev" advocates that on the issue of young intellectuals heading to the mountains and countryside: "You will suffer, and others will know. You suffer first, and benefit later." This is a delusion of using the philosophy of "suffering a little to gain a lot" to deceive us into using the hardships of heading to the mountains and countryside as a means to promotion and wealth, making us into bourgeois individualists to serve his restoration of capitalism. This is extremely reactionary!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Hard work is like a burden placed before us, to see if we dare to shoulder it.... Let others enjoy the benefits, take the heaviest burdens, suffer first, and enjoy later. Such comrades are good comrades." Revolution is not afraid of hardship; those who fear hardship do not make revolution. We young intellectuals head to the mountains and countryside for the revolution, not for personal gain.

In August 1965, twelve of us female young intellectuals resolutely followed Chairman Mao's words, with revolutionary aspirations, and settled down in Linhe County. We came from the capital of our country, Beijing, to the countryside. This was a tremendous change. Previously, we lived in the city, and everything was done for us. In the countryside, we had to sew our own clothes and cook our own meals. Often, we would make noodles into a mess or cook rice that was half raw. We were also inexperienced in production. Especially during the summer harvest, cutting wheat was hot, tiring, prickly, and thirsty. Villagers would cut twice, but we couldn't even manage once. We got anxious and cut too fast, slicing our hands. Some comrades developed a sense of difficulty. So, we seriously studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao taught us: "In the socialist cause, to think that one can avoid difficulties and twists and turns, pay no great price, and always have smooth sailing and easily achieve success, such a thought is merely a fantasy." Chairman Mao's teachings gave us the strength to overcome difficulties. In labor, we gradually established class feelings with the poor and lower-middle peasants. They were our teachers, patiently teaching; we were their students, humbly learning. Now, we have learned to plant in spring, weed in summer, harvest in autumn, and do various farm work in winter, and we have also gotten used to rural life.

The process of persisting in heading to the mountains and countryside is a process full of class struggle. In the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of class enemies, in order to sabotage the revolution and production, proposed the slogan of "returning to the old home to make revolution," inciting us to leave the countryside and return to the city. This cold wind of "returning" caused some comrades' thoughts to waver. Should we make revolution with the poor and lower-middle peasants, or return to the city? We brought this question to Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao, in criticizing those with hedonistic thoughts, pointed out: "They always hope that the troops will march to big cities. They go to big cities not to work, but to enjoy." The so-called "making revolution" by returning to the city is essentially fearing hardship, seeking enjoyment, and not wanting to persist in uniting with the poor and lower-middle peasants. We unanimously expressed: Follow Chairman Mao's words, absolutely do not take the backward path, and persist in making revolution on the spot!

Last February and March, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party stirred up a counter-revolutionary tide of capitalist restoration. We, together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, fought resolutely against them. Because we are young women, they instructed some people who did not understand the truth to insult, provoke, and intimidate us. They also, under the pretext that some young intellectuals had bad family backgrounds, prevented poor and lower-middle peasants from getting close to us. They even, under various false charges, removed all the positions we young intellectuals held in society. What should we do then? We brought this question to Chairman Mao's works again. Chairman Mao taught us: "Our comrades should see achievements and see the light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage." To defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we fear neither hardship nor death, daring to climb the knife mountain and cross the fire sea. Revolution is not for becoming an official; whether or not one is a cadre, one should still make revolution. We, together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, writing hundreds of big-character posters, concentrating on criticizing the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, headed by Chinese Khrushchev.

We always remember Chairman Mao's great teachings of "grasp revolution, promote production." During the day, we go to the fields to work, and in the evening, after work, we run seven or eight miles to participate in debate meetings, criticism meetings, and accusation meetings. After the meetings, we return home at midnight, and the next day continue to work. We did this for several months and finally achieved double victories in revolution and production.

We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the reactionary revisionist fallacies of Chinese Khrushchev, and forever advance along the revolutionary path of uniting with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, as indicated by Chairman Mao!

    为革命上山下乡
    北京下乡知识青年小组
    中国赫鲁晓夫在知识青年上山下乡问题上鼓吹什么：“你们受了苦，人家会知道的。你们吃苦在前，得利在后。”这是妄想用“吃小亏，占大便宜”的市侩哲学，诱骗我们把上山下乡吃点苦作为升官发财的手段，使我们成为资产阶级利己主义者，为他复辟资本主义效劳。真是反动透顶！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“艰苦的工作就象担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。……享受让给人家，担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。这样的同志就是好同志。”革命不怕苦，怕苦不革命。我们知识青年上山下乡是为了革命，而不是为了个人得利。
    一九六五年八月，我们十二名女知识青年坚决听毛主席的话，怀着革命的雄心壮志，来到临河县安家落户。我们由祖国的首都北京来到农村，这是一个巨大的变化。以前，我们过着城市生活，做什么都依靠别人。到了农村，衣得自己缝，饭得自己做，常常把面条做成糊糊，把米饭做成夹生饭。我们在生产上更是外行。特别是在夏收时期，割小麦，又热，又累，又扎，又渴。社员割两趟，我们一趟还上不去。我们一着急，割得快了，就割破了手。有的同志产生了畏难情绪。于是，我们认真地学习了毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们：“在社会主义事业中，要想不经过艰难曲折，不付出极大努力，总是一帆风顺，容易得到成功，这种想法，只是幻想。”毛主席的教导给了我们克服困难的力量。在劳动中，我们逐渐同贫下中农建立起了阶级感情。他们是我们的老师，耐心教；我们是他们的学生，虚心学。如今，我们学会了春种、夏锄、秋收、冬打各种农活，对农村生活也习惯了。
    坚持上山下乡的过程，是一个充满着阶级斗争的过程。无产阶级文化大革命初期，一小撮阶级敌人为了破坏革命，破坏生产，提出什么“打回老家闹革命”的口号，煽动我们离开农村，回城市去。这股“回流”的冷风，使一些同志的思想有了波动。是同贫下中农一起闹革命，还是回城市呢？我们带着这个问题请教毛主席著作。毛主席在批评有享乐主义思想的人时指出：“他们总是希望队伍开到大城市去。他们要到大城市不是为了去工作，而是为了去享乐。”所谓回城市“闹革命”，实质上就是怕艰苦，图享乐，不愿意坚持同贫下中农相结合。我们一致表示：听毛主席的话，绝不走回头路，坚持就地闹革命！
    去年二、三月间，党内一小撮走资派掀起了一股资本主义反革命复辟的逆流。我们和广大贫下中农一起，同他们进行了坚决的斗争。因为我们是女青年，他们就指使一些不明真相的人辱骂我们，气我们，吓我们。他们还借口有的知识青年家庭出身不好，不让贫下中农同我们接近。他们甚至以种种莫须有的罪名，把我们知识青年在社会上担任的职务全都撤销了。这该怎样办呢？我们又带着这个问题向毛主席著作请教。毛主席教导我们：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线，我们不怕苦，不怕死，刀山敢上，火海敢闯。革命不是为了做官，当不当干部都一样干革命。我们和广大贫下中农一起，活学活用毛主席著作，一连写了好几百张大字报，集中地批判了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派。
    我们始终牢记毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导，白天下地搞生产，晚上收了工，跑七、八里路去参加辩论会、批判会和控诉会。开完会，半夜三更跑回来，第二天继续出工。我们一直搞了好几个月，终于取得了革命和生产的双胜利。
    我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义谬论，永远沿着毛主席指引的同工农兵群众相结合的革命大道阔步前进！
