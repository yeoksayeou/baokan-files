Revolutionary workers at the Xi'an People's Flour Mill cherish and support the newly established revolutionary committee with great political enthusiasm. The revolutionary committee actively accepts the criticism and supervision of the revolutionary workers, establishing a close bond between the committee and the workers.

The revolutionary committee of the Xi'an People's Flour Mill has been in existence for over a year. As soon as it was born, class enemies stirred up trouble, attempting to sow discord between the masses and the committee, and to overthrow the new proletarian revolutionary power. However, the revolutionary workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, love their revolutionary power the most. Not only did they not fall for the tricks, but under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, they united even more closely, exposed the plots of a handful of class enemies who attempted to sabotage the committee, and dealt a heavy blow to the counter-revolutionary arrogance of the class enemies. At the beginning of this year, the factory revolutionary committee presented each revolutionary worker with a framed portrait of Chairman Mao. A few people actually removed the words "Revolutionary Committee" from the frame. Revolutionary workers immediately conducted an investigation, and it was discovered that the person behind this incident was a hidden counter-revolutionary. This incident deeply educated all the revolutionary workers in the factory, making them realize that the class enemies, who are unwilling to admit defeat, are still struggling desperately, and that the proletarian power must be defended through struggle. At the same time, it also deeply educated the members of the revolutionary committee, making them further realize that only by relying closely on the masses can the revolutionary committee be consolidated and developed.

Revolutionary workers at the Xi'an People's Flour Mill often approach the revolutionary committee with a protective attitude, offering criticisms and suggestions for improving work. The revolutionary committee regards such criticism and supervision from the revolutionary masses as the greatest concern and support for the committee, and as an important condition for the committee's continuous consolidation and development. Therefore, as soon as the committee was established, it made eight regulations for connecting with the masses and improving work style, and distributed them to the revolutionary workers for supervision of the committee's work. The committee stipulated that at least one expanded meeting of the committee, with the participation of ordinary workers, should be held every week to listen to the criticisms of the revolutionary workers.

Under the cherishing and support of all revolutionary workers in the factory, the revolutionary committee of this factory has been further consolidated and developed. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, all revolutionary workers in the factory have been vigorously promoting the revolution and vigorously advancing production. Following the completion of the annual production task two and a half months ahead of schedule last year, the production plan for the first half of this year has also been greatly exceeded.

    西安人民面粉厂革委会不断巩固发展，超额完成今年上半年生产计划
    据新华社西安十五日电 西安人民面粉厂的革命职工以极大的政治热情爱护和支持新生的革命委员会，革命委员会主动地接受革命职工的批评和监督，革命委员会和革命职工间建立起血肉般的联系。
    西安人民面粉厂革委会成立一年多了。革委会刚一诞生，阶级敌人就兴风作浪，挑拨群众同革委会的关系，妄想颠覆新生的无产阶级革命政权。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命职工，最热爱自己的革命政权，他们不但没有上当，而且在革委会的领导下，更紧密地团结起来，揭露了一小撮阶级敌人妄图破坏革委会的阴谋，狠狠打击了阶级敌人的反革命气焰。今年年初，厂革委会赠送给每个革命职工一幅有像框的毛主席画像。有极少数人竟把像框上的落款“革命委员会”五个字挖掉了。革命职工立即进行追查，结果发现，指使干这件事的是一个暗藏的反革命分子。这件事深深教育了全厂革命职工，他们认识到，不甘心失败的阶级敌人仍在进行垂死挣扎，无产阶级的政权必须用战斗来保卫。同时也深深教育了革命委员会的成员，使他们更进一步认识到，只有紧紧依靠群众，革命委员会才会得到巩固和发展。
    西安人民面粉厂的革命职工经常以爱护的态度向革委会提出改进工作的批评和建议。革委会把革命群众的这种批评和监督，看作是革命群众对革委会最大的关心和支持，看作是革委会不断巩固和发展的重要条件。因此，革委会一成立，就作出联系群众、改进工作作风的八条规定，发给革命职工，以便于让大家监督革委会的工作。革委会规定，每周至少召开一次有普通工人参加的革委会扩大会议，听取革命职工的批评。
    这个厂的革委会在全厂革命职工的爱护和支持下，进一步得到巩固和发展。在革委会领导下，全厂革命职工狠抓革命，猛促生产，继去年提前两个半月超额完成全年生产任务之后，今年上半年的生产计划又大大超额完成。
