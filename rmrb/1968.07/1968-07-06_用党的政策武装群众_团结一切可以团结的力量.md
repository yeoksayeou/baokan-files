Chairman Mao teaches us: “Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party.” The Party’s policies represent the interests of the broad masses. Only by strictly adhering to the Party’s policies and strategies can the revolutionary mass movement achieve victory.

In dealing with the revolutionary mass movement, the Chinese Khrushchev promoted the bourgeois reactionary line, sometimes veering to the right, sometimes appearing “left” but actually right, relentlessly undermining the Party’s policies and strategies. His evil purpose is to suppress the revolutionary masses and steer the revolutionary mass movement onto the bourgeois track.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, whenever the movement reached a critical moment, the handful of traitors, spies, and die-hard capitalist-roaders represented by the Chinese Khrushchev would always play tricks and shoot dark arrows, distorting and undermining the Party’s policies, diverting the main direction of the struggle. Such conspiratorial activities were also evident in our factory. In response to this situation, our support-left group continuously armed the masses with the Party’s policies, foiling the enemy’s various tricks, and protecting the broad revolutionary masses. Recently, when the revolutionary masses of the printing and dyeing factory launched a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, these class enemies, unwilling to perish, took the opportunity to confess their crimes to the revolutionary masses and played all sorts of tricks. They were like mad dogs with broken spines, biting and clinging wildly, pushing some of their major crimes onto certain masses who had been deceived and used by them. Faced with such a sharp and complex situation, our support-left group studied Chairman Mao’s latest instructions: “Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship.” We clearly recognized that whether to implement correct policies or incorrect policies would directly affect the development of the movement, serving as the dividing line between “protecting” and “suppressing” the masses. We should arm the masses with the Party’s policies, thoroughly expose the conspiracies of the class enemies, correctly handle the deceived masses, unite all possible forces, and strike at the handful of true enemies. We and the members of the revolutionary committee immediately followed Chairman Mao’s instruction to “turn the Party’s policies into the actions of the masses,” going to various workshops with the revolutionary masses to repeatedly study Chairman Mao’s teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people and “correctly treating the deceived masses.” For those who had been deceived by class enemies and made mistakes, we adopted the policy of “unity-criticism and self-criticism-unity,” helping them draw a clear line with the class enemies, turning against them one after another, ensuring the healthy development of the movement, and firmly striking at the handful of die-hard class enemies. In the process of supporting the left, we deeply felt that in the development of the mass movement, we must continuously arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought and the Party’s policies, resolutely fight against any attempts to suppress the revolutionary masses, and ensure that the revolutionary mass movement always advances along the track of Mao Zedong Thought. This is the greatest support for the broad leftist masses and the best protection for the broad masses of the people.

The struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads is becoming increasingly sharp and complex. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in various places will use even more concealed and vicious means to undermine the Party’s policies, distort Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, and divert the direction of the struggle. We must always stand on the side of protecting the broad masses of the people and the Party’s policies, arm the masses with the Party’s policies, raise the policy level and fighting skills of the broad revolutionary masses, rely on the power of the Party’s policies, and rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    用党的政策武装群众
    团结一切可以团结的力量

    毛主席教导我们说：“政策和策略是党的生命”。党的政策是代表广大人民利益的，只有不折不扣地按照党的政策和策略办事，革命的群众运动才会胜利。
    在对待革命群众运动方面，中国赫鲁晓夫推行资产阶级反动路线，一忽儿右，一忽儿形“左”实右，竭力破坏党的政策和策略。他的罪恶目的，就是要镇压革命群众，把革命的群众运动纳入资产阶级的轨道。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，每当运动发展到一个关键时刻，以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的一小撮叛徒、特务和顽固不化的走资派总是耍阴谋，放暗箭，歪曲和破坏党的政策，转移斗争大方向。他们的这种阴谋活动，在我们所在的厂里也有表现。针对这种情况，我们支左小组就不断用党的政策武装群众，粉碎了敌人的种种阴谋诡计，保护了广大革命群众。最近，当印染厂革命群众向一小撮阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻时，一小撮阶级敌人不甘心灭亡，借向革命群众交代罪行之机，大耍花招。他们象打断脊骨的疯狗，乱咬乱缠，把自己的一些主要罪行推到曾被他们蒙蔽利用的某些群众的头上。面对这样尖锐复杂的情况，我们支左小组学习了毛主席的最新指示：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”我们清楚地认识到，执行正确的政策还是执行错误的政策，将直接影响到运动的发展，是对群众“保护”还是“镇压”的分界线。我们应该用党的政策武装群众，彻底揭露阶级敌人的阴谋，正确对待受蒙蔽的群众，团结一切可以团结的力量，打击一小撮真正的敌人。我们和革委会成员立即遵照毛主席“善于把党的政策变为群众的行动”的教导，分头到各车间同革命群众一起，反复学习毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾和“要正确地对待受蒙蔽的群众”的教导，对受了阶级敌人蒙蔽，做过错事的群众，采取“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的政策，帮助他们划清和阶级敌人的界线，纷纷反戈一击，保证了运动的健康发展，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮顽固不化的阶级敌人。我们在支左过程中深刻体会到，在群众运动的发展过程中，不断用毛泽东思想和党的政策武装群众，坚决地同蓄意镇压革命群众的行为作斗争，使革命的群众运动始终沿着毛泽东思想的轨道前进，就是最大的支持左派广大群众，就是最好的保护广大人民群众。
    两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争越是尖锐复杂，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地的代理人就会以更加隐蔽更加毒辣的手段破坏党的政策，歪曲毛主席的革命路线，转移斗争大方向。我们一定要永远站在保护广大人民群众和党的政策的立场上，用党的政策武装群众，提高广大革命群众的政策水平和斗争艺术，依靠党的政策的威力，依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
