The entire nation's hundreds of millions of military personnel and civilians solemnly commemorate the 47th anniversary of the birth of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong. They warmly celebrate Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao receiving over 20,000 revolutionary warriors from all over the country on the eve of this glorious festival. The hundreds of millions of military personnel and civilians resolutely declare that at this crucial moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they must better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, consolidate and develop the great victories already achieved in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, consolidate and develop the newly established revolutionary committees, strengthen proletarian dictatorship, and carry the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes through to the end!

The joyous news of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin receiving revolutionary warriors from various places has spread across the country, causing a great stir. Revolutionary masses, revolutionary groups, and People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers, in their celebrations of the 47th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, repeatedly raised their fists and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" People across the country warmly celebrated: The great leader Chairman Mao is in excellent health, which is the greatest happiness for the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country. They said, Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most, relies on the masses the most, and respects the masses' pioneering spirit the most, always keeping his heart connected with the masses. Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, at this crucial moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, once again received revolutionary warriors from various places, which is the greatest care and encouragement for the military and civilians across the country.

On this glorious day of commemorating the Party's birthday, the hundreds of millions of military personnel and civilians across the country warmly celebrated that after two years of tempering and testing through the mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Party's connection with the masses has been greatly strengthened and is becoming purer, stronger, and more vigorous. They repeatedly studied the important editorial "Carry Forward the Party's Style of Close Ties with the Masses" published in the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily, and were greatly inspired. They said, this important editorial conveys the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao and the battle call of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We must study it repeatedly, understand it deeply, implement it seriously, and follow it resolutely. They said, now the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not far away, but to consolidate and develop this victory will take a long time and require tremendous effort. At this historical juncture, carrying forward the Party's style of close ties with the masses is of great significance. We must always remember Chairman Mao's great teachings to "believe in and rely on the masses, believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, and believe in and rely on the majority of the cadres," unite with the masses, defeat the enemy, consolidate victories, and develop victories.

	Firmly Protect the Broad Masses of the People
	Strike Hard at a Handful of Class Enemies

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." The hundreds of millions of military personnel and civilians across the country, while celebrating the 47th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, reviewed Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They pointed out that relying on the broad masses of the people and strengthening proletarian dictatorship are two aspects of the same problem. We must believe in and rely on the broad masses of the people, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, correctly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, and accurately and resolutely strike at a handful of class enemies to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The entire personnel of the "Model Unit for Military-Civilian Defense" stationed on the front line of the East China Sea reviewed Chairman Mao's latest instructions late into the night. They said: Firmly relying on and maintaining close ties with the people is the fundamental mark that distinguishes a proletarian party and government from all bourgeois parties and governments, and distinguishes the people's army from all reactionary armies of the bourgeoisie. We must always remember Chairman Mao's great teachings about believing in the masses and relying on the masses, always carry forward the glorious tradition of the Party's close ties with the masses, and at any time and under any circumstances, always stand on the side of the broad masses of the people, strengthen proletarian dictatorship, and resolutely strike at the remnants of the Kuomintang and other handful of class enemies. Members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Shanghai Shipyard said, believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and respecting the masses' pioneering spirit is the core of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The Chinese Khrushchev advocates that "the masses are backward" and "the working class is not necessarily reliable," which are thoroughly reactionary bourgeois fallacies aimed at suppressing revolutionary masses. We must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, protect the masses, and ensure that our proletarian government will never change color. Members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Xi'an Flour Mill said, combining their personal experiences, they deeply felt: The people are the source of power for the proletarian government. Whenever the work of connecting with the masses is done well, the revolutionary committee appears vigorous, and the struggle against the enemy is carried out vigorously; whenever there is a slight relaxation in the connection with the masses, revolutionary willpower will decline, rightist complacency will rise, and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses cannot be fully mobilized. They unanimously declared that they would follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, believe in, rely on, and unite with the broad masses of the people, and accurately and resolutely strike at a handful of class enemies. Members of the revolutionary committees at various levels in the industrial and transportation system of Qinghai Province, together with the broad revolutionary masses, studied the editorials in the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily. They said: Only by relying on the masses of the people and mobilizing them can we maximize the isolation and strike at a handful of class enemies, better implement dictatorship over the class enemies, and further consolidate proletarian dictatorship. We must carry forward the Party's fine tradition of close ties with the masses personally cultivated by Chairman Mao, rely on and mobilize the masses, and in conjunction with the cleansing of the class ranks and the struggle-criticism-transformation of various units, carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	Forever Rooted Among the Masses of the People
	Consolidate and Develop the New Revolutionary Committees

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most fundamental aspect of reforming state organs is to connect with the masses." Members of revolutionary committees at various levels and the broad masses of military personnel and civilians across the country, on this glorious day of commemorating the 47th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, unanimously declared that they would follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, rely on the broad masses to strengthen the construction of revolutionary committees, make them forever rooted among the masses of the people, and become revolutionary, authoritative, and vigorous proletarian command posts. Leaders of the Harbin Railway Bureau Revolutionary Committee pointed out that the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and Kuomintang-style practices advocated by the clique led by the Chinese Khrushchev for a long time were aimed at destroying the Party's revolutionary tradition of close ties with the masses, creating a separation between the Party and the masses, and creating a separation between the proletarian government and the masses. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao has greatly carried forward the Party's revolutionary tradition of close ties with the masses, further strengthened the connection between the Party, the government, and the masses of the people, which has extremely far-reaching significance for ensuring that the Party and the country will never change color. We must turn carrying forward the Party's glorious tradition into conscious action and never leave the masses. Members of the Revolutionary Committee of Sanhe Commune in the suburbs of Nanjing said, consolidating and developing the revolutionary committee is a process of serious class struggle. Currently, class enemies are doing everything they can to sow discord between the revolutionary committee and the masses, or use honeyed words to corrupt us, attempting to overthrow the revolutionary committee. We must resolutely smash the class enemies' plots with actual actions. We must blend in with the masses in our thoughts, style, and life, be ordinary in every way, think what the masses think, worry about what the masses worry about, help what the masses need, and build a flesh-and-blood relationship with poor and lower-middle peasants, be a cow for the poor and lower-middle peasants for life, and pull the revolutionary cart for life. Members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Railway Bureau declared that they would definitely do the following: Even if positions change, the attitude of being a student of the masses will not change; even if status changes, the revolutionary essence of sharing joys and sorrows with the masses will not change. Members of the Revolutionary Committee of Yangpu District, Shanghai, said, the revolutionary committee can only have strong vitality, be consolidated and developed, and never change color if it adheres to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, maintains close ties with the masses, and firmly relies on the masses.

	"The people, and only the people, are the motive force of world history." Members of revolutionary committees across the country, combining the two years of struggle practice in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, reviewed Chairman Mao's famous saying and felt particularly close to it. They said, consolidating and developing the revolutionary committee is also a process of learning from the masses and continuously summing up experiences. The masses of the people have the most practical experience, and the masses of the people are full of boundless creativity. Only by being a student of the masses, respecting the masses' pioneering spirit, and fully mobilizing the masses' enthusiasm can we consolidate and develop the victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, consolidate and develop the newly established revolutionary committees, strengthen proletarian dictatorship, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	Better Study and Apply Mao Zedong Thought
	Resolutely Carry Out Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line

The hundreds of millions of military personnel and civilians across the country, while solemnly commemorating the 47th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, emphasized that adhering to studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely carrying out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, timely, accurately, and comprehensively implementing the battle tasks and policies of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and turning them into the conscious actions of the masses, is the fundamental task of revolutionary committees at all levels and the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses. To accomplish this great task, we must raise the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents on all fronts, thoroughly criticize the revisionist party-building line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and eliminate all his poisonous influences. Thousands of revolutionary masses in Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, today in the place where the Communist Party of China held its first National Congress—South Lake, carried out the "three loyalties" activity of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, severely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and highly praising Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They declared that they would definitely master the great Mao Zedong Thought and let Chairman Mao's revolutionary line guide everything. Members of the Dazhai Production Brigade, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, said, always believing in, loving, relying on, connecting with, and protecting the masses of the people is Chairman Mao's consistent teaching to every Communist Party member. Leaving the masses of the people is leaving Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must, in the great criticism of thoroughly criticizing the entire counter-revolutionary revisionist line and revisionist party-building line of the Chinese Khrushchev, thoroughly establish Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and party-building line, and let Chairman Mao's revolutionary line shine forever. The hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country and the soldiers and officers fighting on the front lines of "three supports and two militaries" declared, while solemnly commemorating the Party's birthday, that they would review Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The Party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization that can lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses in their struggle against class enemies." They are determined to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, break private interests and establish public interests in the great storms of class struggle, transform their worldviews, and strive to temper themselves into advanced elements of the proletariat, to complete the great historical mission of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship and make greater contributions to the communist movement.

    发扬毛主席培育的党紧密联系群众的作风
    巩固发展无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利
    各地军民认真学习“七一”重要社论，坚决表示，在当前夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，一定要更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，巩固和发展已经取得的伟大胜利，巩固和发展新生的革委会，加强无产阶级专政，把无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底
    新华社一日讯　全国各地亿万军民，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级感情，隆重纪念以毛泽东同志为领袖的伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党诞生四十七周年，最热烈地欢呼毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席在这个光辉节日前夕接见了来自全国各地的两万多名革命战士。亿万军民坚决表示，在当前夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，一定要更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，发扬毛主席亲自培育的党的紧密联系群众的优良作风，巩固和发展我们在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中已经取得的伟大胜利，巩固和发展新生的革命委员会，加强无产阶级专政，把无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底！
    伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席接见各地革命战士的特大喜讯传来，全国一片欢腾。各地无产阶级革命派、革命群众和人民解放军指战员，在他们举行的纪念中国共产党成立四十七周年的庆祝活动中，千遍万遍地振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”各地军民热烈欢呼：伟大领袖毛主席身体非常非常健康，这是全党、全军、全国人民的最大幸福。他们说，毛主席最相信群众，最依靠群众，最尊重群众的首创精神，永远和群众心连心。毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻又一次接见各地革命战士，这是对全国军民的最大关怀、最大鼓舞。
    在纪念党的生日的光辉日子里，各地亿万军民热烈欢呼，经过两年来无产阶级文化大革命群众运动的洗炼和考验，我们的党和群众的联系极大地加强了，正在变得更加纯洁、更加坚强、更加朝气蓬勃。他们一遍又一遍地学习了《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》的重要社论《发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风》，受到了巨大的鼓舞。他们说，这篇重要社论传达了伟大领袖毛主席的声音，传达了以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号召，我们一定要反复学习，深刻领会，认真落实，坚决照办。他们说，现在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利已经不远了，但要巩固和发展这个胜利则需要很久的时间和付出巨大的努力。在这样的历史关头，发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风具有十分重大的意义。我们一定要更加牢记毛主席“要相信和依靠群众，相信和依靠人民解放军，相信和依靠干部的大多数”的伟大教导，团结群众，战胜敌人，巩固胜利，发展胜利。
        坚决保护广大人民群众
        狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”全国亿万军民在欢庆中国共产党成立四十七周年的时候，重温了毛主席的这一最新指示。他们指出，依靠广大人民群众，加强无产阶级专政，这是同一个问题的两个侧面。我们一定要相信和依靠广大人民群众，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。驻守在东海前线的“军民联防模范连”全体指战员，连夜重温了毛主席的最新指示。他们说：坚决依靠和紧密联系人民群众，是无产阶级政党和政权区别于一切资产阶级政党和政权的根本标志，是人民军队区别于一切资产阶级反动军队的根本标志。我们一定要永远牢记毛主席关于相信群众、依靠群众的伟大教导，永远发扬我党紧密联系群众的光荣传统，在任何时候，在任何情况下，永远站在广大人民群众一边，加强无产阶级专政，坚决打击国民党残渣余孽等一小撮阶级敌人。上海沪东造船厂革命委员会的成员说，相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，这是毛主席革命路线的核心。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹什么“群众落后”、“工人阶级也不一定能依靠”等等，是彻头彻尾镇压革命群众的资产阶级反动谬论。我们一定要坚决贯彻毛主席的革命路线，相信群众，依靠群众，保护群众，使我们的无产阶级政权永远不变颜色。西安人民面粉厂革委会的成员们结合自己的亲身实践，深有体会地说：人民群众是无产阶级政权的力量的源泉。什么时候联系群众的工作做得比较好，什么时候革委会就显得朝气蓬勃，对敌斗争就搞得轰轰烈烈；什么时候稍稍松懈了同群众的联系，革命意志就会消沉下来，右倾轻敌思想就会抬头，群众的革命积极性就不能得到充分发挥。他们一致表示，一定遵循毛主席的伟大教导，相信、依靠和团结广大人民群众，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。青海省工交系统的各级革委会成员，和广大革命群众一道，学习了《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志和《解放军报》的社论。他们说：只有依靠人民群众，放手发动群众，才能最大限度地孤立和打击一小撮阶级敌人，更好地向阶级敌人实行专政，进一步巩固无产阶级专政。我们一定要发扬毛主席亲自培育的党的紧密联系群众的优良作风，依靠和发动群众，结合清理阶级队伍和各单位的斗批改，深入而持久地开展革命大批判，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
        永远扎根于人民群众之中
        巩固和发展新生的革委会
    毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”各地各级革命委员会成员和广大军民在纪念中国共产党诞生四十七周年的光辉日子里，一致表示要遵循毛主席的伟大教导，依靠广大群众加强革命委员会的建设，使它永远扎根于人民群众之中，成为革命的、有无产阶级权威的、朝气蓬勃的战斗指挥部。哈尔滨铁路局革委会的领导成员指出，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，长期以来推行的一整套反革命修正主义路线，搞的一套国民党作风，就是要破坏党的密切联系群众的革命传统，制造党和群众的分离，制造无产阶级政权和群众的分离。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，极大地发扬了党的紧密联系群众的革命传统，进一步密切了党、政权和人民群众的联系，这对于保证党和国家永不变色具有极其深远的意义。我们一定要把发扬党的光荣传统变成自觉的行动，一刻也不脱离群众。南京郊区三河公社革委会的成员说，巩固和发展革委会的过程，是一个严重的阶级斗争的过程。当前，阶级敌人千方百计地挑拨革委会和群众的关系，或者用糖衣炮弹来腐蚀我们，妄图搞垮革委会。我们一定要用实际行动来坚决粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋。我们要在思想上、作风上、生活上处处和群众打成一片，毫不特殊，作到想群众之所想，急群众之所急，帮群众之所需，同贫下中农建立血肉相连的关系，当一辈子贫下中农的牛，拉一辈子革命的车。北京铁路分局革命委员会成员表示，一定要做到：职务变了，甘当群众小学生的态度决不变；地位变了，和群众同甘共苦的革命本色决不变。上海杨浦区革命委员会的成员说，革命委员会只有坚持毛主席的革命路线，密切联系群众，紧紧依靠群众，才会有强大的生命力，才能得到巩固和发展，才能永不变色。
      “人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”各地革命委员会成员结合两年来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践重温毛主席的这一名言，都感到分外亲切。他们说，巩固和发展革命委员会的过程，也是向群众学习和不断总结经验的过程。人民群众最有实践经验，人民群众中蕴藏着无穷的创造力。只有甘当群众的小学生，尊重群众的首创精神，充分发挥群众的积极性，才能巩固和发展无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，巩固和发展新生的革命委员会，加强无产阶级专政，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
        更好地活学活用毛泽东思想
        坚决贯彻毛主席的革命路线
    各地亿万军民在隆重纪念中国共产党诞生四十七周年的时候强调指出，坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，坚决执行毛主席的革命路线，及时地准确地全面地把以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗任务和方针政策落实到群众中去，变为群众的自觉行动，这是各级革命委员会和亿万革命群众的根本任务。为了完成这个伟大的任务，就一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在各条战线上推行的反革命修正主义路线，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线，肃清其一切流毒。浙江省嘉兴县数千名革命群众，今天在中国共产党举行第一次全国代表大会的地方——南湖，开展无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，大赞大颂毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们表示，一定要把伟大的毛泽东思想学到手，让毛主席的革命路线统帅一切。无限忠于毛主席革命路线的大寨大队的党员们说，永远相信、热爱、依靠、联系和保护人民群众，是毛主席对我们每一个共产党员的一贯教导。脱离人民群众，就是脱离毛主席的革命路线。我们一定要在大破中国赫鲁晓夫的一整套反革命修正主义路线和修正主义建党路线的革命大批判中，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和建党路线，让毛主席的革命路线世世代代永放光芒。各地亿万革命群众和战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的各部队指战员，在隆重纪念党的生日的时候，重温了毛主席的最新指示：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”他们决心更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，坚决捍卫毛主席的革命路线，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中破私立公，改造世界观，努力把自己锻炼成为无产阶级的先进分子，为完成在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的伟大历史使命，为共产主义运动做出更大的贡献。
