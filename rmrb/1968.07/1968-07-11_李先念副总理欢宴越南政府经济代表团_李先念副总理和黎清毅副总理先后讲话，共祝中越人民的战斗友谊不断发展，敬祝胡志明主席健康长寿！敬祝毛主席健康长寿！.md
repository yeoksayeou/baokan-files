	BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) — Vice Premier Li Xiannian of the State Council hosted a banquet this evening to warmly welcome the Vietnamese Government Economic Delegation led by Vice Premier Le Quoc Vy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Vice Premier Le Quoc Vy both spoke, wishing for the continuous development of the combat friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples. They wished for the long life and good health of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and Chairman Mao!

	Vice Premier Li Xiannian spoke first at the banquet. He warmly congratulated the heroic Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Ho Chi Minh, for achieving continuous, heartening victories in the great struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. He said that the great victories of the Vietnamese people in their war against U.S. aggression and for national salvation have once again demonstrated the mighty power of people's war. As our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out, "Regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated."

	Vice Premier Li Xiannian said, the end of the U.S. aggressors in Vietnam is not far off. "However, all reactionary forces, when they are on the verge of extinction, always struggle desperately." The U.S. imperialists will not accept defeat easily. On the one hand, they are increasing their military budget, continuing to send more troops to South Vietnam, intensifying the bombing of North Vietnam, and strengthening the war of aggression. On the other hand, with the help and coordination of the modern revisionists of the Soviet Union, they are hatching a plot of "peace talks," attempting to gain from the negotiating table what they cannot obtain on the battlefield. The cunning plot of U.S. imperialism will never succeed.

	Vice Premier Li Xiannian said, two years ago, the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, issued a call to arms to the Vietnamese people. He said, "The war may last five, ten, twenty years, or even longer. Hanoi, Haiphong, and other cities and enterprises may be destroyed, but the Vietnamese people will not be intimidated!" Recently, Chairman Ho again called on all Vietnamese people to "overcome all hardships, fear no sacrifices, fight continuously, launch widespread attacks, and achieve greater new victories." This is the ironclad pledge of the Vietnamese people to defeat U.S. imperialism, embodying the unyielding will of the 31 million Vietnamese people to fight unitedly. We believe that under the wise leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the heroic Vietnamese people, by persevering in a protracted war, will surely overcome all difficulties on the road ahead, win the final victory in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, drive the U.S. aggressors out of Vietnam, and achieve national liberation and reunification.

	Vice Premier Li Xiannian said, the visit of the Vietnamese Government Economic Delegation led by Vice Premier Le Quoc Vy to our country coincides with the stage of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution when it is on the verge of achieving comprehensive victory, and the whole country is in a great situation. The comrades of the Vietnamese Government Economic Delegation, through their visits and inspections, can clearly see that this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made socialist China more consolidated and stronger. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will better carry forward the spirit of internationalism and more powerfully support the revolutionary struggles of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world. The Chinese people will resolutely follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, contribute their strength to support the Vietnamese people, and thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialism. In the face of the great unity of the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples, any attempt to sow discord and sabotage Sino-Vietnamese friendship is doomed to failure.

	Vice Premier Le Quoc Vy then spoke, introducing the brilliant victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. He said that since the New Year of 1968, the military and people of South Vietnam, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, have launched several offensives in succession, dealing fatal blows to the U.S. imperialist aggressors and their lackeys. In the past three years of countering the U.S. imperialists' war of destruction, the military and people of North Vietnam have already shot down more than 3,000 U.S. aircraft. The main feature of the current situation is that the failure of U.S. imperialism is already very obvious. The Vietnamese people will surely win, and the U.S. imperialist aggressors will surely be defeated.

	Vice Premier Le Quoc Vy condemned the U.S. imperialists for talking about peace on the one hand, while intensifying the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the other, continuing to send more troops to South Vietnam, increasing war expenses, and reorganizing the puppet army, attempting to strengthen their war of aggression against Vietnam.

	He said, the 31 million Vietnamese people are united as one, responding to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's sacred call for national salvation, determined to overcome all difficulties and wage a resolute struggle against the most vicious enemy of mankind—U.S. imperialism—to win the most basic rights of the nation: independence, freedom, reunification, and territorial integrity. Wherever there are U.S. aggressor invaders on Vietnamese soil, every Vietnamese person has the right to drive them out.

	Vice Premier Le Quoc Vy pointed out that the close brotherly relationship between the peoples of Vietnam and China has been further strengthened in today's struggle against the most dangerous common enemy—U.S. imperialism. As our Chairman Ho said, "Vietnam-China friendship runs deep, comrades and brothers."

	Vice Premier Le Quoc Vy said, Chairman Mao, in his message on December 19, 1967, to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, said, "We firmly support you. Our two countries are neighboring countries that depend on each other. Our two peoples are brothers who share weal and woe. The brotherly South Vietnamese people and all Vietnamese people can be assured that your struggle is our struggle. The 700 million Chinese people are a strong rear guard for the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is a reliable rear base for the Vietnamese people." These words, we Vietnamese people are deeply grateful for and will always remember. On behalf of the Vietnam Labor Party, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Vietnamese people, I express our heartfelt and profound thanks to the Chinese Communist Party led by the respected Chairman Mao, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people for their firm support and great, precious assistance.

	He said, under the leadership of the respected Chairman Mao, the great People's Republic of China is becoming stronger and more prosperous day by day. In the past two years, the Chinese people have launched a magnificent and extensive Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered the stage of achieving comprehensive victory. He wished the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the Chinese people greater and more brilliant comprehensive victories.

	Vice Premier Le Quoc Vy finally said, all the great victories achieved by the Chinese people from the past to the present are the victories of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, achieved under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party led by the respected Chairman Mao Zedong. The achievements of the brotherly Chinese people are a great encouragement to the revolutionary struggle of the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people fully support all the efforts made by the Chinese people in promoting the socialist revolution, socialist construction, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Vice Deputy Head of the Vietnamese Government Economic Delegation Li Ban, Vu Minh Loan, and other delegation members, diplomatic officials from the Vietnamese Democratic Republic Embassy in China, and Head of the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China Nguyen Van Quang attended the banquet.

	Those who attended the banquet to accompany were responsible comrades from relevant departments of the Chinese government, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, including Wen Yuzheng, Han Nianlong, Li Qiang, Xie Huai, Guo Lu, Ding Xilin, and Xiang Qian. Responsible members of the revolutionary mass organizations in the capital and representatives of the Five Good Soldiers of the garrison troops in Beijing were also present.

    李先念副总理欢宴越南政府经济代表团
    李先念副总理和黎清毅副总理先后讲话，共祝中越人民的战斗友谊不断发展，敬祝胡志明主席健康长寿！敬祝毛主席健康长寿！
    新华社十日讯　国务院副总理李先念今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎由越南民主共和国政府副总理黎清毅率领的越南政府经济代表团。
    李先念副总理和黎清毅副总理先后讲话。共祝中越两国人民的战斗友谊不断发展，敬祝胡志明主席健康长寿！敬祝毛主席健康长寿！
    李先念副总理在宴会上首先讲话，他热烈祝贺英雄的越南人民在伟大领袖胡志明主席的领导下，在抗美救国的伟大斗争中，不断取得了振奋人心的胜利，为全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的斗争树立了一个光辉榜样。他说，越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，再一次表明人民战争的强大威力。正如我们的伟大领袖毛主席所指出的，“国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”
    李先念副总理说，美国侵略者在越南的末日不远了。“但是，一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。”美帝国主义决不甘心失败，它一方面在增加军事预算，继续向南越增兵，加紧对越南北方的轰炸，强化侵略战争，另一方面，它又在苏联现代修正主义的帮助和配合下，大搞“和平谈判”的阴谋，妄图从谈判桌上捞取它在战场上得不到的东西。美帝国主义的这种狡猾的阴谋是绝不会得逞的。
    李先念副总理说，两年前，越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席就向越南人民发出了战斗的号召。他说：“战争可以延长五年、十年、二十年或者更长的时间，河内、海防和其他一些城市、企业可能被摧毁，但是越南人民是不会被吓倒的！”最近，胡主席又号召全体越南人民“克服一切艰苦，不怕任何牺牲，连续地打，广泛出击，夺取更大的新胜利。”这是越南人民战胜美帝国主义的钢铁誓言，它体现了三千一百万越南人民团结战斗的坚强意志。我们相信，英雄的越南人民在胡志明主席的英明领导下，坚持持久战争，一定能够克服前进道路上的任何困难，赢得抗美救国战争的最后胜利，把美国侵略者赶出越南，取得民族的解放和祖国的统一。
    李先念副总理说，以黎清毅副总理为首的越南政府经济代表团这次来我国访问，正是我国无产阶级文化大革命进入夺取全面胜利的阶段，全国是一片大好形势。越南政府经济代表团的同志们通过参观访问可以清楚地看到，这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，已经使社会主义的中国变得更加巩固，更加强大。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民将更好地发扬国际主义精神，更有力地支援兄弟的越南人民和全世界人民的革命斗争。中国人民坚决遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，为支援兄弟的越南人民，彻底打败美帝国主义贡献出自己的力量。在中越两国人民的伟大团结面前，任何挑拨和破坏中越友谊的企图都是注定要失败的。
    黎清毅副总理接着讲话，介绍了越南人民在抗美救国战争中取得的辉煌胜利。他说，一九六八年新春以来，越南南方军民在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，连续发动了多次攻势，给美帝国主义侵略者及其走狗以致命的打击。越南北方在三年多的反击美帝国主义的破坏性战争中，我们军民已经打落三千多架美国飞机。目前形势的主要特点是，美帝国主义的失败已经十分明显。我们越南人民必胜，美帝国主义侵略者必败。
    黎清毅副总理谴责美帝国主义一面在口头上大讲和平，一面却对越南民主共和国加强轰炸，继续向越南南方增派军队，增加战争费用，重新组建伪军，妄图加强对越南的侵略战争。
    他说，三千一百万越南人民万众一心，响应胡志明主席的神圣的救国号召，决心克服一切困难，同人类最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义进行坚决的战斗，争取民族的最基本的权利：独立、自由、统一和领土完整。在越南的国土上那里有美国侵略强盗，每个越南人就有权利到那里去赶走他们。
    黎清毅副总理指出，越中两国人民的亲密的兄弟关系，在今天反对最危险的共同敌人——美帝国主义的战斗中，更进一步密切了。正如我们胡主席所说：“越中情义深，同志加兄弟。”
    黎清毅副总理说，毛主席在一九六七年十二月十九日为庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年时说：“我们坚决支持你们。我们两国是唇齿相依的邻邦。我们两国人民是休戚与共的兄弟。兄弟的越南南方人民和全体越南人民可以相信，你们的斗争就是我们的斗争。七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。”这番话，我们越南人民非常感激和铭记在心。我代表越南劳动党，越南民主共和国政府和越南人民，对以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国共产党，中华人民共和国政府和中国人民所给予的这种坚决支持以及巨大、宝贵的援助，表示衷心的、深切的感谢。
    他说，在以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国共产党的领导下，伟大的中华人民共和国日臻富强。两年来，中国人民又轰轰烈烈地、深入广泛地开展了无产阶级文化大革命。目前，无产阶级文化大革命已经进入夺取全面胜利的阶段。他祝中国无产阶级文化大革命取得更大的辉煌的全面胜利。
    黎清毅副总理最后说，中国人民从过去到现在所取得的一切伟大胜利，都是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的胜利，是在以敬爱的毛泽东主席为首的光荣的中国共产党领导下取得的胜利。兄弟的中国人民所取得的成就，对越南人民的革命斗争是一个巨大的鼓舞。越南人民全力支持中国人民在推动社会主义革命、社会主义建设事业和无产阶级文化大革命方面所作的一切努力。
    越南政府经济代表团副团长李班、吴明鸾和代表团团员，越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆外交官员，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长阮文广等，出席了宴会。
    出席宴会作陪的，有我国政府部门、中国人民解放军和北京市革命委员会等有关方面的负责人温玉成、韩念龙、李强、谢怀德、郭鲁、丁西林、向前，首都革命群众组织的负责成员以及驻京部队五好战士代表。
