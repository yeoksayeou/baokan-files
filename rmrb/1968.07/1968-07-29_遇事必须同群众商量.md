     Consult the Masses on All Matters
     Yang Shouxī, Team Leader of the Second Team of Linjiaya Brigade, Dongjiao Commune, Xining City
     Tian Delu, Deputy Team Leader

     Of all things, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the most important. Above all else, maintaining close ties with the masses is fundamental.

     In the past, we thought we were great and did not consult the masses on matters, nor did we listen to criticisms. As a result, the masses had many complaints about us, and our work was not done well. At that time, we did not humbly examine ourselves but instead blamed the community members for not listening and being difficult to "manage."

     After the establishment of the commune revolutionary committee, the committee members and the stationed PLA soldiers helped us study this issue under the guidance of Chairman Mao. We repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant, not understanding this point, we cannot gain even the most basic knowledge" and "The most fundamental aspect of reforming state organs is to maintain close ties with the masses," and we examined our own thoughts. On the surface, our bodies were with the poor and lower-middle peasants, but because our hearts were not united with the poor and lower-middle peasants, we did not receive the help and support of the masses, and the revolution and production could not advance. The responsibility for this mainly lies with us, the cadres.

     From then on, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings and implemented several measures to maintain close ties with the masses: we patiently listen to the opinions of the masses, correct our mistakes, and encourage those who do not; when we make mistakes, we go to the masses to check ourselves and make self-criticisms; we often visit the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants, inquire about their hardships, and humbly listen to their opinions; every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday evening after studying Chairman Mao's works, we let the masses criticize us. We consult the masses on all matters, let everyone come up with ideas and solutions. In production, if there are things we do not understand, we humbly ask the old farmers for advice.

     The masses saw that we had changed our style, and they became enthusiastic towards us, daring to give us advice and criticize us, making our relationship with the masses closer day by day. The first time the community members gave us advice, it was very good. They said that we did not study Chairman Mao's works well, and as cadres, we only studied them verbally but did not put them into action. Afterwards, we grasped the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works based on the masses' criticisms, striving to focus on the "application" aspect.

     Because we were humble, the community members could boldly criticize the shortcomings or mistakes in our work and help us arrange our work and production well. Once, it rained, and we did not arrange the production well, causing a waste of labor. The community members gave us sharp criticisms. We checked ourselves with the masses and quickly corrected the mistake. In this way, the community members loved us more, and they came to consult us on matters, with everyone caring for the collective and devising strategies for the collective. Originally, we had some land on the mountain, but because the yield was not high and it was far away, we later did not cultivate it, and it became barren. After learning from Dazhai, the community members said that we should learn from the people of Dazhai, take the road of self-reliance, and plant as much as possible to reduce the burden on the state. Everyone said this idea was good, so we opened up the barren land on the mountain and planted ten mu of peas, which grew very well and completely solved the problem of livestock feed. There are many such examples.

     These events show that believing in the masses and relying on the masses can solve any problem. Originally, we were busy here and there every day, but we did not maintain close ties with the masses. As a result, our words were not listened to, and our work was not helped. Now that we have maintained close ties with the masses, we consult with the masses to solve problems together. The enthusiasm of the masses has been fully mobilized, and the work has been done very smoothly. Some community members encouraged us, saying, "Keep doing like this!"

     遇事必须同群众商量
     西宁市东郊公社林家崖大队第二队队长　杨守西　副队长　田得禄
    千重要、万重要，活学活用毛主席著作最重要。一千条，一万条，联系群众是最根本的一条。
    过去我们认为自己了不起，有事不跟群众商量，更听不得批评意见。结果，群众对我们的意见很大，工作也搞不好。当时，我们不虚心检查自己，反怪社员不听话，不好“管”。
    公社革委会成立以后，革委会的同志和驻队的解放军同志，帮助我们带着这个问题向毛主席请教。我们反复学习了毛主席关于“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识”和“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”等教导，对照检查了自己的思想。从表面上看，我们的身子和贫下中农是在一起的，但是由于没有和贫下中农的心贴在一起，得不到群众的帮助和支持，革命和生产还是上不去。这个责任主要在我们干部身上。
    从此以后，我们遵循毛主席的教导，订了几条联系群众的措施：对于群众提出的意见，要耐心地听，有则改之，无则加勉；自己错了，到群众面前去检查，多作自我批评；经常深入贫下中农家里，访贫问苦，虚心听取群众意见；每周一、三、六晚上学习毛主席著作以后，让群众给我们提出批评意见。有事同群众商量，让大家出主意，想办法。生产上有不懂的地方，虚心向老农请教。
    群众见我们改变了作风，对我们也热情了，能够大胆地给我们提意见，批评我们，使我们和群众的关系一天天密切起来。第一次社员给我们提意见，就提得很好，说我们队毛主席著作学得不够好，当干部的学在嘴上，没有落实在行动上。以后，我们根据群众的批评，狠抓活学活用毛主席著作，努力在“用”字上狠下功夫。
    由于我们虚心了，社员对我们工作中的缺点或错误，能及时大胆地提出批评，帮助我们把工作、生产安排好。有一次，天下雨，我们没有把生产安排好，造成了误工现象，社员对我们提出了尖锐的批评。我们向群众作了检查，并且很快作了改正。这样，社员对我们更爱护了，有事也来找我们商量，人人关心集体，为集体出谋划策。我们原来在山上有一部分地，由于产量不高，走去又远，后来再没有种，就荒下了。学习了大寨以后，社员们说，我们要向大寨人学习，走自力更生的道路，多种一亩是一亩，可以减少国家的负担。大家都说这个意见好，就在山上开了荒地，种了十亩豌豆，长得很好，完全可以解决牲畜的饲料问题。象这样的例子很多。
    这些事情说明：相信群众，依靠群众，什么问题都好办。原先，我们整天这里忙，那里跑，就是没有联系群众，结果，说话没人听，作事没人帮，现在和群众联系密切了，碰到问题和群众一起商量解决，群众的积极性得到了充分发挥，工作搞起来很顺利。有些社员鼓励我们说：“就这样干下去！”　（据新华社）
