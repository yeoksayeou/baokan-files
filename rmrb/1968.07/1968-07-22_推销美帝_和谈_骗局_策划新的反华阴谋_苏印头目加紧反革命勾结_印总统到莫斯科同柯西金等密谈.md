The U.S. Empire is pushing the "peace talks" scam and plotting new anti-China conspiracies. The Soviet and Indian leaders are tightening their counter-revolutionary collusion. The Indian President visits Moscow for secret talks with Kosygin and others.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 20th, Moscow: Amidst the drumbeat of collusion between the Soviet revisionist clique and the Indian reactionaries, Indian President Hidayatullah recently rushed to Moscow for secret talks with the Soviet revisionist leaders, further plotting counter-revolutionary schemes.

	According to TASS, during Hidayatullah's visit to the Soviet Union from the 8th to the 18th, Soviet revisionist leaders Kosygin, Podgorny, and others held multiple secret talks with him on a series of issues, including the situation in Southeast Asia, the Vietnam problem, the Middle East problem, and Soviet-Indian collusion, all in a "frank and friendly atmosphere."

	The joint statement issued on the 18th regarding Hidayatullah's visit to the Soviet Union declared that the two sides' positions on "a series of important issues in the current international situation" were "congruent or very close." These two accomplices of U.S. imperialism, when discussing the Vietnam problem and the situation in Southeast Asia, avoided mentioning the U.S. aggression but viciously attacked the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression, claiming that the Vietnam problem has created "an extremely tense situation in Southeast Asia that threatens more extensive military conflicts." At the same time, they cheered for the U.S. "peace talks" scam, calling for the maintenance and consolidation of "universal peace and security" in Southeast Asia. Regarding the Middle East problem, both sides demanded that the Arab countries, which have been invaded by U.S. imperialism and its lackey Israel, "fully implement" the resolutions made by the U.N. Security Council, which is manipulated by the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists, attempting to force the Arab countries to acknowledge the fait accompli created by the U.S.-Israeli invaders. The Soviet and Indian sides also advocated for the establishment of a "European security system" and "universal peace" to enable the U.S. to withdraw more troops from Europe to strengthen its aggression against Asian countries.

	The tightening of Soviet-Indian collusion to oppose China is also an important topic in the talks between the Soviet revisionist leaders and Hidayatullah. The day before Hidayatullah arrived in Moscow, the Indian newspaper "The Statesman" revealed that he would discuss "China's policy" with the Soviet revisionist leaders during the talks and bluntly stated that on the issue of opposing China, the Soviet revisionists "obviously sympathize with India's position."

	Hidayatullah was very satisfied with his counter-revolutionary collusion with the Soviet revisionist leaders this time. He said that this talk was "full of mutual understanding and satisfaction" and was "extremely beneficial." He even said that the "good relationship" established between the Soviet Union and India "exceeds the recognized international relations standards."

	The Indian reactionary leaders are not making such arrogant claims out of thin air. In recent years, to cooperate with U.S. imperialism in extinguishing the revolutionary flames of the peoples of Southeast Asia and to form an anti-China encirclement, the Soviet revisionists and the Indian reactionaries have been continuously tightening their collusion. Especially since the beginning of this year, their steps of comprehensive collusion have accelerated unprecedentedly. Kosygin led a large delegation to India twice in January and April to discuss with the Indian reactionary leaders on the issues of comprehensive collusion between the two countries and joint opposition to China. During this period, the exchanges between Moscow and New Delhi were extremely frequent. Now, the Soviet revisionist clique has become the largest military aid supplier to the Indian reactionaries, and the Soviet Union has become India's second-largest creditor and third-largest trading partner. Hidayatullah's visit to the Soviet Union this time is a new step in the Soviet revisionist clique's tightening of anti-China, anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary collusion with the Indian reactionaries.

### 推销美帝“和谈”骗局　策划新的反华阴谋  苏印头目加紧反革命勾结  印总统到莫斯科同柯西金等密谈

    推销美帝“和谈”骗局　策划新的反华阴谋
    苏印头目加紧反革命勾结
    印总统到莫斯科同柯西金等密谈
    据新华社二十日讯莫斯科消息：在苏修叛徒集团同印度反动派加紧勾结的锣鼓声中，印度总统侯赛因最近赶到莫斯科，同苏修头目进行密谈，进一步策划反革命的勾当。
    据塔斯社报道，在印度反动派头目侯赛因八日到十八日访苏期间，柯西金、波德戈尔内等苏修头目，分别同他就东南亚局势、越南问题、中东问题和苏印勾结等一系列问题，在“坦率和友好的气氛”中进行了多次秘密会谈。
    十八日发表的侯赛因访苏公报叫嚷说，双方在会谈中“对一系列当前国际局势重要问题的立场”，是“吻合的或者非常接近的”。这两个美帝国主义的帮凶在谈到越南问题和东南亚局势时，避而不谈美帝的侵略罪行，却恶毒攻击越南人民的抗美救国斗争，胡说什么越南问题使
  “东南亚出现了孕育着更广泛的军事冲突的威胁的极其紧张局势”。同时，他们还为美帝的“和谈”骗局摇旗呐喊，叫嚷什么要维护和巩固东南亚的“普遍和平与安全”。关于中东问题，双方叫嚷要遭到美帝国主义和它的走狗以色列侵略的阿拉伯国家，“完全履行”由美帝苏修操纵的联合国安理会所作的“决议”，企图迫使阿拉伯国家承认美以侵略者造成的既成事实。苏印双方还鼓吹建立“欧洲的安全体系”和“普遍和平”，以便美帝从欧洲抽调更多的兵力来加强对亚洲国家的侵略。
    苏印加紧勾结进行反华，也是苏修头目同侯赛因会谈的重要内容之一。在侯赛因到达莫斯科的前一天，印度《政治家报》就透露，他将同苏修头目在会谈中讨论“中国的政策”，并且毫不掩饰地说，在反华问题上，苏修“显然同情印度的观点”。
    侯赛因对他这次同苏修头目进行的反革命勾搭，感到十分满意。他说，这次会谈“具有相互谅解和满意的精神”，是“极其有益的”。他甚至说，苏印建立的“这种良好关系”，
  “超过了公认的国际关系准则”。
    印度反动派头目这样狂妄地叫嚣，并不是偶然的。近几年来，为了配合美帝国主义扑灭东南亚人民的革命斗争烈火和拼凑反华包围圈，苏修叛徒和印度反动派一直在不断加紧进行勾结。特别是今年年初以来，它们全面勾结的步伐空前加速。柯西金在一月和四月曾两次率领庞大的代表团亲自到印度活动，同印度反动派头目就苏印两国全面勾结和联合反华等问题进行密谈。这期间，莫斯科和新德里之间的来往，也异常频繁。现在苏修集团已成为印度反动派最大的军“援”供应者，苏联变成了印度第二大债权国和第三位贸易国。侯赛因这次访苏，是苏修集团同印度反动派加紧反华、反共、反人民、反革命的一个新步骤。
