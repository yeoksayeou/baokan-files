	Resolutely Follow the Path Indicated by Chairman Mao
	Chairman Mao's Good Worker, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Liaoning Province, Worker Engineer Wei Fengying

	Our heart's reddest sun, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "Universities must still be run. I am mainly talking about technical and engineering universities that must still be run, but the school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, proletarian politics should be in command, and the path of cultivating technical personnel from workers as taken by the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory should be followed. Students should be selected from workers and peasants with practical experience, sent to school for a few years, and then returned to production practice." This latest directive greatly boosts the morale of the proletarian revolutionary faction, greatly dampens the arrogance of the bourgeois reactionaries, and makes us more and more excited and more and more energetic. It speaks to the heart of our working class. We resolutely support it and will resolutely implement it.

	Chairman Mao's latest directive is not only the battle program for us to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end but also the great program for the industrial technological revolution, pointing out a bright path for the future industrial revolution.

	Comrade Lin Biao, Vice Chairman, said: "Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage." From my personal experience, I feel even more intimately the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest directive.

	Our factory used to produce according to foreign frameworks, with a pile of foreign dogmas. This couldn't be changed, that couldn't be moved, everything was done according to the instructions of "experts" and "authorities," seriously restricting the development of production. In 1958, we broke through these frameworks. Our workshop organized the Red-Expert Team, with young workers, veteran workers, and revolutionary technical personnel organizing together. After work, we studied Chairman Mao's works and carried out technological innovations. We studied every day, carried out innovations every day, without missing a day due to wind or rain. Since 1958, we have implemented over 700 large and small technological innovations. Some of the innovation projects were "old difficulties" that "experts" and "authorities" dared not touch or tackle, but we broke through them one by one.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most intelligent and most talented are those with the most practical experience." Why can those unnamed "little people" create miracles that college graduates and foreign experts cannot? It is because they are laborers with practical experience, who love Chairman Mao limitlessly, admire Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought limitlessly, and are loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line limitlessly. They are loyal to the proletarian revolutionary cause, selfless, not seeking fame or personal gain, unyielding, and unshakable. They have a bold and daring proletarian spirit. They are not afraid of losing face, learn if they don't know, and practice what they learn. They learn from practice, summarize from practice, and continuously improve, climbing the scientific and technological peak for the revolution.

	Some college graduates and foreign experts have higher education and knowledge than us in the Red-Expert Team, and their "theories" are also good, but they cannot achieve anything. There are countless reasons, but ultimately, it is because they do not put proletarian politics in command and their theories are not connected to practice. These people have a common problem: they love to daydream in their rooms, close the door and build a car, do not combine with workers, and sometimes superficially follow the mass line, but deep down, they do not trust the masses, resulting in nothing being achieved. Sometimes what they produce cannot be used, some designs do not match the actual situation, and some installations are improper. If they act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, truly combine with workers, put down their arrogance, humbly learn from workers, and sincerely learn from workers, they will immediately achieve results.

	Countless experiences prove that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of our working class, our soul, and our powerful ideological weapon for revolution and liberating all mankind. With Mao Zedong Thought, our working class has everything. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can create everything. Only by resolutely acting according to Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely following the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers can we achieve new merits for the people and the Party; otherwise, we will suffer a shameful failure.

	Every new thing that appears will inevitably be attacked by conservative forces and class enemies, and the Red-Expert Team is no exception. As soon as this new thing appeared, a handful of capitalist roaders within the factory party tried every means to sabotage it. They said things like, "You have no culture, what can you do! Even the experts couldn't do it, I think you should just give up!" There were many malicious rumors, but we did not listen to them. We resolutely followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "making up our minds, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," and continued to work amidst the enemy's shouts, becoming stronger and stronger, and increasing the number of innovation projects.

	Through this period of practice, I further realized that Chairman Mao's latest directive: "Follow the path of cultivating technical personnel from workers as taken by the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory" is extremely correct and extremely wise. The path of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory is our path. We will resolutely advance along the path indicated by Chairman Mao.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction." We will resolutely use Chairman Mao's latest directive as a weapon to thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist scientific and technological line of the Chinese Khrushchev, thoroughly establish Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary scientific and technological line; thoroughly smash the revisionist educational line and thoroughly establish the proletarian educational line, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

### 坚决走毛主席指引的道路

    坚决走毛主席指引的道路
    毛主席的好工人、辽宁省革委会副主任、工人工程师　尉凤英
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”这一最新指示，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了资产阶级反动派的威风，越听越高兴，越听越有劲，说到了我们工人阶级的心坎上了。我们坚决拥护，坚决照办。
    毛主席最新指示，不仅是我们将无产阶级教育革命进行到底的战斗纲领，也是工业技术革命的伟大纲领，为今后工业革命指明了光明的道路。
    林彪副统帅说：“毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。”我从自己的切身经历中，更加亲切地体会到毛主席最新指示的伟大意义。
    我们工厂过去按外国框框生产，洋教条一大堆，这个不能改，那个不能动，一切都按照“专家”、“权威”的指令办事，严重束缚了生产的发展。一九五八年，打破了这些框框，我们车间组织了红专大队，青年工人、老师傅、革命的技术人员组织在一起，下班后学毛主席著作，搞技术革新。天天学，日日搞，风雨不误。从一九五八年以来，先后实现了七百多项大小技术革新。有的革新项目，是“专家”“权威”不敢碰不敢摸的“老大难”，也都被一一攻破了。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”为什么那些不出名的“小人物”，能创造出大学生、洋专家所创造不出来的奇迹呢？就因为他们是劳动者，有实践经验，对毛主席无限热爱，对毛泽东思想无限崇拜，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线无限忠诚。他们对无产阶级革命事业赤胆忠心，一心为“公”，不为名，不为利，不屈不挠，百折不回。他们有一股敢想敢干的无产阶级硬骨头精神。他们不爱面子，不会就学，学了就干，从干中学，不断实践，不断总结，不断提高，为革命而攀登科学技术高峰。
    一些大学毕业生、洋专家，学历、知识都比我们红专大队的人高，“理论”也棒，可就是搞不出什么名堂。千条原因，万条原因，归根结底就是一条：不突出无产阶级政治，理论不联系实际。这些人有个通病，就是爱在屋子里空想，闭门造车，不和工人结合，有时形式上走了群众路线，骨子里还是不相信群众，结果一事无成。有时搞出来的东西不能用，有的设计不符合实际，有的安装不当。他们只要按毛主席指示去作，真正和工人结合，放下架子，甘当小学生，拜工人为师，老老实实向工人学习，就会立刻创造出成绩。
    无数经验证明，战无不胜的毛泽东思想是我们工人阶级的命根子，是我们的灵魂，是我们工人阶级干革命、解放全人类的强大思想武器。有了毛泽东思想，我们工人阶级就有了一切。有了毛泽东思想，就能创造一切。只有坚决按毛泽东思想办事，坚决走同工农兵相结合的道路，才能为人民、为党立新功，不然，就要遭到可耻的失败。
    一切新生事物的出现，都要遭到保守势力和阶级敌人的攻击，红专大队也不例外。这个新事物一出现，工厂党内一小撮走资派，就千方百计地进行破坏。说什么“你们没有文化，能搞什么！人家专家都没有搞成，我看还是算了吧！”风言风语多得很，我们没有听那一套，坚决遵照伟大领袖毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，在敌人叫喊声中干下去，越干越强，革新项目不断增多。
    通过这一段实践，使我进一步认识到，毛主席的最新指示：“走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路”，无比正确，无比英明。上海机床厂的道路，就是我们的道路。我们坚决沿着毛主席指引的道路勇猛前进。
    毛主席教导我们说：“不破不立”，我们坚决用毛主席最新指示为武器，彻底砸烂中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义科技路线，大立毛主席无产阶级革命科技路线；大破修正主义教育路线，大树无产阶级教育路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
