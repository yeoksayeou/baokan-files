The editorial note for the article "From Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, See the Path of Cultivating Engineering and Technical Personnel" in the People's Daily conveys the extremely important latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao. The news spread, and the revolutionary workers throughout the factory rushed to tell each other, and the atmosphere was one of great joy. Our factory's revolutionary committee and all revolutionary workers wholeheartedly support and will definitely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions!

The latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao are a new development of Marxism-Leninism, a great battle program guiding the people of the entire country to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end, and a century-long strategy for anti-revisionism. Chairman Mao's great instructions have sentenced the counter-revolutionary revisionist technological line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev to death and guide us to enter a new high tide of industrial revolution.

For more than a decade, the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee and a small handful of die-hard capitalist roaders within the factory have been fiercely resisting Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. On the contrary, they have been vigorously promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist technological line of the Chinese Khrushchev. They spread the reactionary fallacy of "those who labor with their minds rule over others, and those who labor with their strength are ruled by others," promoting revisionist goods such as "expert management" and "technology first." The technical power in the entire factory is in the hands of a small handful of reactionary technical "authorities." They do not value cultivating technical personnel from workers with the most practical experience. In the technical team of this factory, there are very few technical personnel of worker origin. In the use of college graduates, they allocate graduates from "top" universities to the design department, then to the process department, and they think the "worst" are allocated to the workshop. This causes most technical personnel to long be detached from proletarian politics, detached from the worker masses, and detached from production practice, only sitting in the office "making plans behind closed doors."

The die-hard capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities" in the factory do not believe in the worker masses, slandering workers as having "low technology," "stupid brains," and "no ability," using "control" and "restrict" methods to suppress the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad worker masses, and not allowing workers to participate in scientific and technological research work. Therefore, the technical level of our factory has long been in a state of stagnation.

Do those reactionary technical "authorities" really have the ability? No. Since 1958, under the direct supervision of a reactionary technical "authority," the factory began designing a relatively advanced numerical control combination machine tool. All participants in the design were technical personnel. They relied entirely on foreign design drawings and data for the design. As a result, it took nine years and a large amount of funds, but the machine tool has not been successfully designed. Worker comrades painfully said, "220,000 yuan was spent, and a pile of scrap iron was made."

Do workers really have no ability? No. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, an old worker Wang Shifu, who was considered to "not understand numerical control," with his boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, relying on his long-term practical experience accumulated in production, after repeated pondering, proposed suggestions for improving the design of the machine tool drawings. At first, his suggestions did not attract the attention of the technical personnel. But he did not lose heart and continued to conduct experiments. When encountering difficulties, he would ask some old workers to hold "Zhuge Liang meetings." They finally broke the foreign framework, overcame the four design difficulties of hole spacing, three-hole through, boring the end face, and surface finish that the technical "authorities" had long been unable to solve, and successfully put the machine tool into production.

This example makes us deeply feel that the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "the most intelligent and talented are the warriors with the most practical experience" is extremely wise and correct. It also fully proves that "following the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from workers" is the only correct path for developing technical strength. As the editorial note in the People's Daily said: "The great creative power of the people will continue to create miracles that bourgeois philistines and right-wing conservatives cannot imagine."

After two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the class struggle and two-line struggle awareness of the broad workers and technical personnel in our factory has reached an unprecedented height, and people's spiritual outlook is undergoing profound changes. After the proletarian revolutionary faction took power in our factory, a small handful of reactionary technical "authorities" were also driven off the stage. Many technical personnel began to put down their airs, go deep into the actual situation, and go among the workers, taking the path of combining with the workers. Production and technological innovation have shown a gratifying new situation. However, we are also clearly aware that driving the reactionary technical "authorities" off the stage is only the beginning of the proletarian revolutionary faction taking control of technical power. To foster a batch of proletarian revolutionary technical teams, the task is very arduous. On the path of cultivating technical personnel, there is still a sharp class struggle and two-line struggle. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, continue to mobilize the broad revolutionary workers to deeply carry out the great criticism, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist technological line and management line of the Chinese Khrushchev, take Shanghai Machine Tool Factory as an example, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and contribute to the new industrial revolution of our country.

The proletarian revolutionary faction and engineering and technical personnel of Beijing First Machine Tool Factory warmly acclaim the publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They are determined to seriously study, deeply understand, and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

    坚决走上海机床厂的道路
    北京第一机床厂革命委员会
    《人民日报》为《从上海机床厂看培养工程技术人员的道路》一文所写的编者按，传达了我们伟大领袖毛主席的极为重要的最新指示。消息传来，全厂革命职工奔走相告，一片欢腾。我们厂革命委员会和全厂广大革命职工，对毛主席的这一最新指示一千个拥护，一万个照办！
    伟大领袖毛主席这一最新指示，是马克思列宁主义的新发展，是指引全国人民把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的伟大战斗纲领，是反修防修的百年大计。毛主席这一伟大指示，宣判了中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的反革命修正主义科技路线的死刑，指引我们投入工业革命的新高潮。
    十几年来，旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团和厂内一小撮顽固不化的走资派，一直疯狂地抵制毛泽东思想，抵制毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。相反，他们却极力推行中国赫鲁晓夫的一套反革命修正主义科技路线。他们散布“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的反动谬论，推行“专家治厂”、“技术第一”等修正主义黑货，全厂的技术大权操纵在一小撮反动的技术“权威”的手里。他们根本不重视从最有实践经验的工人中培养技术人员。在这个厂的技术队伍中，工人出身的技术人员寥寥无几。他们在对学校毕业生的使用上，又是把“名牌”大专院校的毕业生分配到设计部门，其次的分配到工艺部门，他们认为最“差”的才分配到车间。这就使得大部分技术人员长期脱离无产阶级政治，脱离工人群众，脱离生产实践，只是坐在办公室里“闭门造车”。
    厂里一小撮顽固不化的走资派和反动的技术“权威”，不相信工人群众，污蔑工人“技术低”，“脑子笨”，“没本事”，用“管”、“卡”的办法压制广大工人群众的积极性和创造性，不许工人参与科学技术研究工作。因此，我们厂的技术水平长时期处于停滞状态。
    那些反动的技术“权威”，就真有本事吗？不。厂里从一九五八年开始，在一个反动技术“权威”的直接主持下，开始设计一台比较先进的程序控制组合机床。参加设计的全部是技术人员。他们完全依靠国外的设计图纸和数据搞设计。结果费时九年，花了大量资金，这台机床还没有设计成功。工人同志痛心地说：“花了二十二万元，搞了一堆废铁。”
    工人真的就没有本事吗？不。在无产阶级文化大革命中，一位被认为“不懂程序控制”的老工人王士富，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，凭着自己在生产中长期积累的实践经验，经过反复琢磨，提出了改进这台机床图纸设计的建议。开始，他的建议没有引起技术人员的重视。但他并不灰心，仍然反复进行试验。遇到困难，就请一些老工人开“诸葛亮会”。他们终于打破洋框框，突破了技术“权威”长期解决不了的孔距、三孔通心、镗端面和光洁度四道设计难关，使这台机床成功地投入生产。
    这个事例使我们深刻地体会到，伟大领袖毛主席关于“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”的教导，无比英明，无比正确。这也充分证明，“走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路”，是发展技术力量的唯一正确的道路。正如《人民日报》编者按中所说：“人民群众的伟大创造力量，将不断创造出为资产阶级庸人和右倾保守主义者所意想不到的奇迹。”
    经过两年来的无产阶级文化大革命，我厂广大工人和技术人员的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟有了空前的提高，人的精神面貌正在经历着深刻的变化。在我厂无产阶级革命派掌权以后，一小撮反动的技术“权威”也被赶下了台。不少技术人员开始放下架子，深入实际，深入到工人中间去，走与工人相结合的道路。生产和技术革新都出现了可喜的新气象。但是，我们也清醒地看到，把反动的技术“权威”赶下台，这仅仅是无产阶级革命派掌握技术大权的开端。要造就出一批无产阶级的革命的技术队伍，任务是十分艰巨的。在培养技术人员的道路上，仍然存在着尖锐的阶级斗争和两条路线的斗争。我们决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，继续发动广大革命职工深入开展革命大批判，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义的科技路线和办厂路线，以上海机床厂为榜样，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为我国新的工业革命做出贡献。
