The organ of the French Marxist-Leninist Communist Party, *Nouvel Humanite*, recently published an article criticizing the book *Revolution in the Revolution?* by the Frenchman Régis Debray on the issue of the people's revolutionary path in Latin America. The article points out that this book is a major counter-revolutionary deception, whose essence is to attack Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Debray's so-called "theory" is actually serving the interests of the international bourgeoisie.

The article states: "Régis Debray's book is a political manifesto that, on the surface, opposes revisionism but in reality opposes Marxism-Leninism. It sets up a false path, a wrong direction, a path with no future for all those who are disgusted with revisionism."

The article goes on to refute Debray's argument that denies the leading role of the proletarian party in the national democratic revolution. The article states: "The crux of his argument is the role of the Marxist-Leninist party in the struggle for national liberation. Lenin and Mao Zedong have fully expounded on this primary issue. In fact, in some of his very famous works, such as *On New Democracy* and *On the People's Democratic Dictatorship*, Mao Zedong has pointed out the role of the party in the national revolution.

	'To make a revolution, a revolutionary party is needed. Without a revolutionary party, without a party built on the basis of Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory and style, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs.'

	'A disciplined party armed with Marxist-Leninist theory, practicing self-criticism, and closely linked with the masses. An army led by such a party. A united front of all revolutionary classes and factions led by such a party. These three are our main weapons to defeat the enemy.'"

The article points out that Debray absurdly opposes these correct statements of Chairman Mao, saying that this view is effective in China but not in Latin America.

The article then criticizes Debray's spread of pure military views. The article states: "The direct result of Debray's stance on the party issue is the 'pure military view,' in which, in his opinion, the gun commands politics." The article further criticizes Debray's view that the military organization of the revolutionary armed forces in Latin America "should be built from the top down: first, the regular troops—the center; then, the semi-regular troops; finally, the militia." The article states: "In Debray's view, the people's army should not come from the masses but should be imposed on the masses from the outside."

The article points out that one should seriously consider the following words of Chairman Mao: "The Chinese Red Army is an armed group executing revolutionary political tasks. Especially now, the Red Army is not just fighting; apart from fighting to annihilate the enemy's military forces, it also has the major tasks of propagating among the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses to establish revolutionary political power, and even building the organization of the Communist Party... Without these objectives of propaganda, organization, arming, and building revolutionary political power, fighting loses its meaning, and the Red Army loses its meaning."

The article states: "In summary, one can see the essence of Debray's book, which is not easy to achieve. Because the important things in the book are mentioned vaguely and are insinuated. Therefore, it can be seen that the purpose of this book is to attack Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and to deny the universal significance of Mao Zedong's theory."

The article points out: "One can draw out many other things from Debray's book that contradict the truth. This is because his 'analysis' is anti-dialectical. He studies each problem in isolation, not in connection with the overall situation. When he studies the situation in Latin America, he does not connect it with the world situation; when he talks about the revisionist parties in Latin America, he covers up the situation of the international communist movement and denies the necessity of political and ideological struggle within a revolutionary organization."

The article concludes: "The narrowness of the views of Debray's followers will lead them to failure. All those who believe in this theory will one day have to choose between revolution and surrender, between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism. There is no third path."

    法国马列主义共产党机关报痛斥德布雷的谬论
    强调马列主义、毛泽东思想是普遍真理
    德布雷关于拉美革命的“理论”实质是攻击马列主义、毛泽东思想，为国际资产阶级效劳
    新华社十五日讯　法国马克思列宁主义共产党机关报《新人道报》不久前发表文章，批判法国人雷吉斯·德布雷就拉丁美洲的人民革命道路问题所写的小册子——《革命中的革命？》。文章指出：这本书是一个反革命的大骗局，其实质是攻击马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想；德布雷所鼓吹的“理论”，实际上是为国际资产阶级的利益服务的。
    文章说：“雷吉斯·德布雷的书是一条表面上反对修正主义、而实际上反对马克思列宁主义的政治路线的宣言书。它给所有厌恶修正主义的人们设置了一条邪道，一条歧途，一条没有出路的路线。”
    文章接着批驳了德布雷否定无产阶级政党在民族民主革命中的领导地位的论点。文章说：“他的论点的要害是在马克思列宁主义政党在民族解放斗争中的作用问题上。列宁和毛泽东已经充分地阐述了这个首要问题。事实上，毛泽东在他的一些非常有名的著作中，例如《中国革命和中国共产党》、《新民主主义论》等，已经指出了党在民族革命中的作用。
      ‘既要革命，就要有一个革命党。没有一个革命的党，没有一个按照马克思列宁主义的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级和广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。’
    ‘一个有纪律的，有马克思列宁主义的理论武装的，采取自我批评方法的，联系人民群众的党。一个由这样的党领导的军队。一个由这样的党领导的各革命阶级各革命派别的统一战线。这三件是我们战胜敌人的主要武器。’”
    文章指出，德布雷荒谬地反对毛泽东主席的这些正确论断，说什么这种观点在中国有效，但在拉丁美洲无效。
    文章接着批判了德布雷所散布的单纯军事观点。文章说：“德布雷关于党的问题的立场的直接结果是‘单纯军事观点’，在他看来，是枪指挥政治。”文章接着还批判了德布雷这样一种论点：拉丁美洲革命武装力量的军事组织“要从上层建起：首先是常规部队——中心；然后是半正规部队；最后是民兵”。文章说：“在德布雷看来，人民军队不应该来自群众，而应该从外部强加给群众。”
    文章指出，应该认真地想一想毛泽东主席的下面一段话：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。特别是现在，红军决不是单纯地打仗的，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务……离了对群众的宣传、组织、武装和建设革命政权等项目标，就是失去了打仗的意义，也就是失去了红军存在的意义。”
    文章说：“综上所述，人们可以看到德布雷这本书的实质，这点不是容易做到的。因为重要的东西在书里提得笼统，是影射的。因而可以看出，这本书的作用是攻击马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，是否认毛泽东的理论的任何普遍意义。”
    文章指出：“人们可以从德布雷的书中引出其他许多违反真理的东西。这是由于他的‘分析’是反辩证法的。他对每一个问题孤立地进行研究，而不是同整个形势联系起来进行研究。他在研究拉丁美洲的形势时也不同世界形势联系起来；他谈到拉丁美洲修正主义党时，掩盖国际共产主义运动的形势，否认一个革命组织内部要进行政治、思想斗争的必要性。”
    文章最后说：“德布雷门徒们的观点的狭隘性，将把他们引向失败。”“所有相信这种理论的人们终将有一天在革命与投降之间，马克思列宁主义与修正主义之间进行选择，不可能有第三条道路。”
