The great criticism of the revolution has powerfully promoted the great development of production. The Inner Mongolia Power Machinery Factory's revolutionary production is thriving.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the revolutionary workers of the Inner Mongolia Power Machinery Factory are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They are firmly grasping class struggle, deeply and persistently carrying out the great criticism of the revolution, and promoting a significant increase in production. In April of this year, the factory's production created a record high since its establishment. In May and June, the factory continued to maintain high production, completing the first half of the year's production plan ahead of schedule and exceeding it. At the same time, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory have successfully implemented over 40 technical innovation projects.

The Inner Mongolia Power Machinery Factory is a factory that provides agricultural power machinery to the entire country. For a long time, class struggle in this factory has been sharp and complex. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, a small handful of stubborn reactionaries, traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries in the factory, unwilling to accept their defeat, spread the counter-revolutionary wind of economic opportunism, incited workers to leave the factory and return home, and continuously created production accidents, attempting to sabotage production to achieve their evil goal of sabotaging the revolution.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the condition of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses led by it and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The revolutionary committee of the factory led the broad revolutionary workers to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, further raising everyone's awareness of class struggle and two-line struggle. They correctly distinguished between two different types of contradictions, united all revolutionary forces that could be united, and launched a fierce attack on the class enemies, exposing a small handful of stubborn reactionaries, traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries. They smashed the class enemies' evil plots to sabotage the revolution and production, repelled the rightist wind of reversing verdicts, further consolidated and developed the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination, and ensured the smooth progress of grasping the revolution and promoting production.

Under the leadership of the factory revolutionary committee, the broad revolutionary workers closely combined the great criticism of the revolution against Liu Shaoqi (referred to as the Chinese Khrushchev) with the struggle against a small handful of class enemies in their unit. They used the small handful of class enemies exposed in their unit as living materials to deeply criticize the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and the revisionist cadre line promoted by Liu Shaoqi and his agents, as well as the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods they promoted, such as "expert management," "material incentives," and "technical leadership." Through deep and persistent revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary workers' class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness were further raised, and their enthusiasm for grasping the revolution and promoting production reached an unprecedented height. In the past, many reasonable suggestions about technical reforms proposed by workers were suppressed by a small handful of capitalist roaders within the party and bourgeois "experts" and "authorities." After the revolutionary criticism, many past innovation projects that were suppressed were successfully implemented. The casting workshop, which used to have the entire casting process operated manually, has now basically achieved mechanization.

    革命大批判有力地推动生产大发展
    内蒙古动力机厂革命生产欣欣向荣
    据新华社呼和浩特电内蒙古动力机厂广大革命职工坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，推动生产大幅度上升。今年四月份，全厂生产创造了建厂以来的最高纪录；五、六两个月，全厂继续保持高产纪录，提前超额完成了上半年生产计划。与此同时，全厂革命职工还搞成了四十多个技术革新项目。
    内蒙古动力机厂是向全国提供农用动力机械的工厂。长期以来，这个厂的阶级斗争一直很尖锐很复杂。厂革委会成立以后，厂里一小撮顽固不化的走资派和叛徒、特务以及其他反革命分子，不甘心于他们的失败，大刮反革命经济主义妖风，煽动工人离厂回家，并且不断制造生产事故，妄图通过破坏生产来达到破坏革命的罪恶目的。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”厂革委会带领广大革命职工反复学习了毛主席这一最新指示，进一步提高了大家的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。他们正确区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的革命力量，主动地向阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻，挖出了一小撮顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子，粉碎了阶级敌人破坏革命、生产的罪恶阴谋，击退了右倾翻案妖风，进一步巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命三结合，保证了抓革命促生产的顺利进行。
    在厂革委会的领导下，广大革命职工把对中国赫鲁晓夫的革命大批判同向本单位一小撮阶级敌人的斗争紧密地结合起来。他们把本单位挖出来的一小撮阶级敌人当作活材料，深入地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的“阶级斗争熄灭”论和修正主义干部路线，以及他们所推行的“专家治厂”、“物质刺激”、“技术挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货。通过深入持久的革命大批判，革命职工的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟进一步提高，抓革命促生产的积极性空前高涨。过去工人提出了许多关于技术改革的合理建议，都被党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级“专家”、“权威”扼杀了。经过革命大批判，把许多过去被扼杀的革新项目搞成了。铸工车间过去整个铸造工艺流程都是手工操作，现在已经基本上实现了机械化。
