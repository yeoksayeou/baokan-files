The revolutionary committee of Jingpo Lake Power Plant, under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army propaganda team, has followed Chairman Mao's instructions on "The party committee must fulfill its leadership responsibilities by relying on the 'team' of the party committee and fully utilizing their roles." The committee has emphasized proletarian politics, striven for the thought revolutionization of the leadership team members, and ensured that the revolutionary committee achieves ideological unity based on Mao Zedong Thought, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the new revolutionary power.

In February of this year, the factory established a revolutionary committee. Initially, the committee was busy managing various tasks across the factory, neglecting its own revolutionary construction. This led to inconsistencies in thought and lack of coordination among members. Problems that should have been resolved by individual members were brought to the committee for lengthy discussions; issues that could be resolved were passed around; and when problems arose, members avoided taking responsibility. These issues caught the attention of the committee's leaders and the propaganda team. They realized that if these issues were not addressed promptly, the committee would not be able to lead thousands of people in battle or construction, as Chairman Mao pointed out, and would weaken the committee's leadership, affecting the entire factory's revolution and production.

What was the root cause of these issues? The committee's leaders and the propaganda team followed Chairman Mao's instructions on "conducting heart-to-heart talks," discussing with the committee members and seeking opinions from the masses. It turned out that these issues stemmed from some revolutionary cadres fearing that mistakes would lead to criticism, and some representatives from revolutionary mass organizations still being influenced by bourgeois factionalism. The committee's leaders and the propaganda team agreed that to overcome these inconsistencies, they must thoroughly eliminate the "selfish" tendencies within their souls, resolve ideological differences, and strengthen unity in action, thereby achieving ideological unity based on Mao Zedong Thought.

The revolutionary committee and the propaganda team, following Chairman Mao's instructions on "class struggle, once grasped, will be effective," started from class education and focused on the concept of power. They organized all committee members to engage in reminiscence and comparison activities, discussing the hardships of being powerless, the happiness of having power, the difficulties of seizing power, the dangers of losing power, and the responsibility of maintaining power. They also discussed Chairman Mao's series of instructions on power issues and listed the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in restoring capitalism and overthrowing the dictatorship of the proletariat. Through intense class education, everyone deeply felt that forgetting about power would mean handing over the power seized from the walking capitalists to the class enemies. Therefore, they must eliminate all obstacles and strive to consolidate and develop the new revolutionary power.

With the help of the propaganda team, the revolutionary committee established Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In these classes, committee members actively studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, discussing problems, finding roots, analyzing harms, and pointing out directions, thereby enhancing their awareness of fighting against selfishness and revisionism. The committee chairman, Zhang Heyi, said, "After being elected to the committee, I always carried the burden of fearing to make mistakes, making me hesitant in my work. These are all manifestations of 'selfishness.' If we do not eliminate this 'selfishness,' we cannot build a good committee." Committee member Cao Chengdong said, "I brought personal grudges into the committee. Instead of supporting colleagues with whom I had disagreements in the past, I sometimes took a passive attitude. This wrong approach is disloyal to Chairman Mao." Following this, everyone openly discussed their thoughts, revealed their selfish tendencies, fought against them, and exposed the "selfishness" hidden deep within their souls.

Increasing awareness does not mean the end of the struggle between "public" and "private" interests. The propaganda team, based on the People's Liberation Army's experience in emphasizing proletarian politics, suggested that the committee establish revolutionary measures, regularly conduct heart-to-heart talks, and carry out criticism and self-criticism.

After focusing on the thought revolutionization of all members, the committee's members have become more united and coordinated. In class struggles, the committee has fully played the role of a proletarian command center. In some workshops where class struggles are complex and revolutionary criticism is not well conducted, the main members of the committee have gone deep into these workshops, directly grasped the enemy situation, mobilized the masses, quickly uncovered the class struggle, exposed a small number of deeply hidden class enemies, and swiftly launched a high tide of revolutionary criticism. The revolution has promoted a leap in production. Broad revolutionary workers have applied the thorough revolutionary spirit from the revolutionary criticism to the actions of grasping the revolution and promoting production. Since this year, Jingpo Lake Power Plant has completed its national and urban-rural power supply and transmission tasks every month. Under the good situation of revolution and production, the revolutionary committee has become more consolidated and stronger.

    狠抓领导班子思想革命化
    大力开展批评和自我批评
    镜泊湖发电厂革委会在毛泽东思想基础上不断发展巩固
    本报讯　黑龙江省镜泊湖发电厂革委会，在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，遵照毛主席关于“党委要完成自己的领导任务，就必须依靠党委这‘一班人’，充分发挥他们的作用”的教导，大力突出无产阶级政治，狠抓领导班子成员的思想革命化，使革委会从组织上的“三结合”达到了以毛泽东思想为基础的思想上的“三结合”，更有力地发挥了新生的革命政权的作用。
    今年二月，这个厂成立了革委会。开始一段时间，革委会忙于抓全厂的各项工作，忽略了自身的革命化建设，工作中一度出现了思想不一致、步调不整齐的现象：本来是革委会成员分工负责的问题，也要拿到革委会讨论半天；能够解决的问题，也要推来推去；出了问题不是主动承担责任，而是躲躲闪闪。这些现象引起了革委会的负责人和宣传队同志的重视。他们认识到，这种现象如果不及时纠正，就将如毛主席所指出的“如果这‘一班人’动作不整齐，就休想带领千百万人去作战，去建设”，势必削弱革委会的领导作用，影响全厂的抓革命促生产。
    这些现象的根子在哪里？革委会负责人和宣传队的同志一道，遵照毛主席关于“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的教导，和革委会成员谈心，并且深入到群众中去征求意见。原来，这些现象的产生，主要是某些革命领导干部，怕工作弄不好出了漏子，落个不是；某些革命群众组织的代表，处理问题还不免受资产阶级派性的影响。革委会负责人和宣传队的同志一致认识到，要克服革委会工作中出现的不协调现象，只有把灵魂深处的“私”字彻底斗倒，从思想上消除分歧，从行动上加强团结，才能使革委会从组织上的“三结合”，真正在毛泽东思想的原则上实现思想上的“三结合”。
    革命委员会和宣传队根据毛主席关于“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的教导，从阶级教育入手，从政权观念着眼，组织革委会全体成员开展了回忆对比活动，引导大家大摆无权的苦、有权的幸福、夺权的艰难、丢权的危害、保权的责任；大讲毛主席关于政权问题的一系列教导；大列中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义、颠覆无产阶级专政的滔天罪行。通过狠抓阶级教育，大家深深感到：如果忘记了政权，就会把从走资派手中夺回来的政权，拱手让阶级敌人夺去。因此，必须扫除一切障碍，千方百计地巩固和发展新生的革命政权。
    革委会在宣传队帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，革委会成员活学活用毛泽东思想，互相摆问题、挖根源、谈危害、指方向，提高了斗私批修的自觉性。革委会主任张合义说：“这次我被选进革委会后，一直背着怕再犯错误的包袱，因此工作起来缩手缩脚，生怕出错。这些都是‘私’字作怪。这个‘私’不斗倒，就休想把革委会建设好。”革委会委员曹成栋说：“我把个人意气带进了革委会。对过去同自己有意见分歧的同志，不但没有热情支持他工作，有时还采取袖手旁观的态度。这种错误的做法，是对毛主席不忠。”接着，大家纷纷推心置腹地交了心，亮了私，斗了私，揭开了隐藏在灵魂深处“私”字的底。
    认识提高了，决不意味着“公”和“私”的斗争就此终结了。宣传队又以人民解放军突出无产阶级政治的切身体会，建议革委会制定了革命化措施，定期开展谈心活动，开展批评和自我批评。
    镜泊湖发电厂革委会经过狠抓全体成员的思想革命化，大家的心贴得更紧了，步调更齐了。在对敌斗争中，革委会充分发挥了无产阶级战斗指挥部的作用。有的班组阶级斗争复杂，革命大批判开展不够好，革委会主要成员就深入到这些班组，直接掌握敌情，充分发动群众，很快揭开了阶级斗争的盖子，揭露了一小撮埋藏得很深的阶级敌人，迅速掀起了革命大批判的高潮。革命推动了生产的飞跃发展。广大革命职工把在革命大批判中爆发出来的彻底革命精神，用在抓革命促生产的行动上。今年以来，镜泊湖发电厂月月完成了国家和城乡供电和送电任务。在革命和生产的大好形势下，革命委员会更加巩固更加坚强了。
