Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Anhui Province, who have achieved a bumper harvest of summer grains and oil crops this year, are filled with profound proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They are eagerly and enthusiastically handing over public grain and selling surplus grain to the state, launching a high tide of summer grain procurement and storage. At present, the province's summer grain procurement and storage volume has increased by 55.6 percent compared to the same period last year. The grain that has already been stored is full of kernels, dried, and clean, with excellent quality.

This year's summer grain and oil procurement work in Anhui Province was carried out under the great situation of continuous victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Since last autumn's sowing, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres throughout the province have actively carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle, greatly raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. At the same time, revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-one combinations are increasingly consolidated and developed in various places, and revolutionary committees are emerging in succession at various levels. Under the powerful impetus of the Cultural Revolution, from the Huaihe Plain to the banks of the Yangtze River, reports of bumper harvests of summer crops are being heard everywhere. This has provided a solid material foundation for the timely and high-quality completion of this summer's grain and oil procurement tasks.

"Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." In the summer grain and oil procurement work, various places have persistently carried out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide the procurement work.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guizhou Province's rural broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, taking class struggle as the key link, vigorously grasping revolution, and vigorously promoting production. This summer's harvest and planting progress is fast and of high quality. According to statistics from relevant departments, by June 20, the province's summer harvested grains and oil crops have basically been harvested; over a thousand mu of corn have been planted; and the area of rice transplantation has been completed by about 90 percent. The fastest progress is in the Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, which has already completed the rice transplantation task, with the rice transplantation area increasing by more than 50,000 mu compared to last year.

Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The leading members of various levels of revolutionary committees in rural Guizhou have, during the summer harvest and planting, gone deep into the production front lines, together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, persistently running and running well various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, greatly promoting ideological revolutionization. The community members proposed: the busier the farming season, the more we should actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. Now, the entire province's rural areas, from the commune to the household, have set up more than ten thousand various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In the study classes, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, in combination with local actual conditions, deeply expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of China's Khrushchev, and also expose and struggle against the sabotage activities of a small handful of capitalist roaders and untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members in Guizhou, in their fierce attacks on a small handful of class enemies, have greatly raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and their enthusiasm for production is soaring. With unbounded loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and boundless hatred for China's Khrushchev, they are doing everything possible to do a good job in summer harvesting and planting, striving to make greater contributions to the socialist revolution and socialist construction.
