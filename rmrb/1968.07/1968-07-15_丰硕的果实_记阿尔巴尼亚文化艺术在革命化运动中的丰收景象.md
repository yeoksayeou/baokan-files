On the Adriatic coast, a great socialist beacon of Europe is shining brightly. The heroic people of Albania, under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, and guided by the historic resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor, have launched a vigorous revolutionary movement. This movement has not only accelerated the development of socialist construction but has also brought about a flourishing scene in literature and art, with a hundred flowers blooming and abundant fruits ripening.

Comrade Enver Hoxha, at the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor, issued a resounding call: "Literature and art should become powerful weapons for the party to educate workers in the spirit of socialism and communism." "The center of creation should be the heroes of our time—the workers, peasants, soldiers, intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres, as well as the youth educated by the party." Albanian revolutionary cultural workers, following Hoxha's teachings, have made reflecting the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and singing their praises, their most important mission. Through literature, film, fine arts, music, and other artistic forms, they have created a large number of vivid images of heroic workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The Heroic Anthem Resounds

Adam Reka, a crane operator at the Durres port, led his comrades in a fierce battle against a stormy sea for several hours, sacrificing his life to protect a giant floating crane and the port. Adam Reka set a shining example of revolutionary heroism. This famous hero attracted the attention of many cultural workers across the country. Various theaters staged plays praising Reka, such as "Our Collective Son," "Flag in the Storm," and "The Party's Son." The ballet "Adam Reka" was also performed. Recently, the "New Albania Film Studio" successfully produced the film "Vast Distances," based on the same theme. The release of this film marks a new height in Albanian film art. The film, with its passionate revolutionary spirit and lyrical style, enthusiastically praises the patriotism of Adam Reka, the party's good son, reflecting the great power of the revolutionary movement in transforming people's souls and the fearless revolutionary heroism of the brave Albanian people.

Last spring, workers Mu. Hixhiu and Mu. Kepi from the "Stalin City" Linas oil station worked tirelessly for two weeks to build a special boiler, ensuring a steady supply of oil to various parts of the country. During the boiler test, a fire broke out. In a critical moment, Hixhiu and Kepi jumped into the flames to close the valve, ensuring the safety of the boiler and oil pipeline, and sacrificed their lives. The two heroes became role models for the Albanian working class, inspiring every revolutionary. Amateur actors from the "Oil Workers" Cultural Palace in Stalin City performed the play "Heroes of Linas," which was a sensation across the country. To date, this play has been performed in Tirana, Shkodra, Korça, and other places. It is a heroic anthem of revolution.

Shkuta Vata, a young girl from the mountain village of Dukagjini, became another famous hero after "Socialist Labor Hero" Adam Reka in the revolutionary movement. At the age of fifteen, Shkuta responded to the party and Hoxha's great call and volunteered to work on the Logjcën-Fier railway construction site. She always led the way in labor and cared for the party's cause and her comrades. One day, she bravely sacrificed her life at the construction site. After Shkuta's death, the party's central committee specially decided to posthumously recognize her as a formal member of the Party of Labor. Shkuta's father, Par Vata, personally took over his daughter's work at the site, continuing the path she had not completed. The names of Par Vata and his daughter became synonymous with patriotism. Hoxha pointed out: "Shkuta, with her brave and daring actions, set a shining example of patriotism, heroism, and boundless love for the motherland, the Party of Labor, and the people." The heroic deeds of Par Vata and his daughter moved all revolutionary cultural workers. In a short few months, poets wrote long poems such as "The Song of Shkuta," "Shkuta's Smile," and "Naim Frasheri." The state publishing house also published a collection titled "Shkuta" and "One Falls, a Thousand Rise." Playwright Fati Kraya created the play "The Fifteen-Year-Old Communist," adding another brilliant image to the revolutionary stage.

December 1967 was a heroic month, a month that the Albanian people will never forget! A strong earthquake struck Dibra and Librazhd, causing significant loss of life and property. However, the heroic people rebuilt and repaired more than 6,300 buildings in less than a month, composing a communist victory song that resonated through the clouds. During the process of overcoming the earthquake disaster, the people demonstrated fearless revolutionary heroism and a lofty communist spirit. As soon as the earthquake struck, famous poet A. Caci, novelist P. Marku, D. Agolli, and dozens of other cultural workers braved the cold wind and heavy snow to reach the disaster area, working with the local people to rebuild their homes. The revolutionary spirit of the people inspired them, and as the houses were rebuilt, a large number of passionate and inspiring works were also created. Works such as Caci's long poem "Conquering the Earthquake," Agolli's "Earthquake and Heroism," and Arapi's "In the Earthquake Zone" received high praise from the people. The oil painting "Party, May You Live as Long as the Mountains" by artist F. Hakiqi is also an excellent work.

Dason Sadinashi, a member of the agricultural cooperative in Korça, shone with communist ideas. To help his class brothers rebuild their homes, he sacrificed his life. After his death, his wife, Nifi Sadinashi, led the volunteer labor team, personally taking over her husband's hoe and shovel, continuing to build houses for her class brothers. Actors from the "An. Z. Cajupi" Theater in Korça, inspired by the heroic figures, created and performed the play "Frontline" in less than ten days, bringing the heroes to the stage. The "New Albania Film Studio" also produced the documentary "December 1967," praising the revolutionary spirit and optimism of the disaster-stricken people, and showing the close relationship between the party and the people.

The movement to completely liberate women has achieved tremendous success. Countless daring revolutionary women have wisdom, courage, and determination, breaking free from the old ideas and customs that bound them, and rushing forward on the path to liberation. Revolutionary cultural workers actively participated in the movement, creating many works full of revolutionary passion and innovative artistic forms. Plays such as "Village Girl," "Fire in the Home," "Destruction," "Bullets in the Dowry Box," and "Drejtë" have enthusiastically praised advanced women who dare to fight against old ideas and customs. These plays have been active on the stage, powerfully promoting the mass movement to completely liberate women.

July 10 is the 25th anniversary of the glorious Albanian People's Army. Over the past 25 years, the heroic army, under the leadership of the party and Comrade Hoxha, has written a brilliant chapter. To commemorate this grand occasion, "The Voice of the People," "Unity," "Light," and the literary monthly "November" all devoted considerable space to publishing memoirs of the national liberation war and new works reflecting the current revolutionary army. Works such as Luan Caffesji's novel "Marching to the Mountains," Lesor Pedo's "They Are Always Soldiers," the reportage collection "On the Path of Heroism," the film "Silent Battle," "Defeating Death," and large-scale songs and dances such as "Cultivating New Land," "Building and Defending the Motherland," and "Soldiers and People Are One" depict thrilling battle scenes, praising the new achievements of the broad cadres and fighters in the socialist construction period, and educating the masses in patriotism and revolutionary traditions.

Describing workers, peasants, and soldiers, and singing their praises, has become the central theme of Albanian cultural workers' creations. Newspapers and magazines feature poems and novels about heroic workers, peasants, and soldiers, shining with immortal light. On the stage and screen, towering images of heroic workers, peasants, and soldiers stand tall. These works describing and singing the praises of workers, peasants, and soldiers inspire people to better carry out socialist revolution and construction.

Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Pledge to Be Masters of Culture

To promote the rapid development of workers, peasants, and soldiers' cultural activities, cultural and artistic networks have been established across the country. Now, in every major city, there are "Houses of Culture" and performing arts troupes. In rural areas, more than 1,600 "Houses of Culture" have been established. During the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1966-1970), the number of cultural and artistic units will significantly increase, with "Houses of Culture" in rural areas expected to reach around 2,000. Even in remote areas like Mat, Mirdita, and the sparsely populated and previously backward and poor Skrapar region, "Houses of Culture" and folk creation societies have been established, with 16 villages forming amateur drama troupes.

Under the leadership of party organizations at all levels, amateur cultural performances are frequently held across the country, fully showcasing the talents of the masses. Recently, the Tirana region held a grand amateur cultural performance, with 90 amateur cultural troupes and 2,215 amateur performers presenting 470 programs, attracting 140,000 spectators. Almost every citizen of Tirana saw a performance, setting a record. In early April, the Shkodra region held a rural cultural performance, with 12 famous art troupes and more than 1,200 amateur performers participating. Old people, children, women, and teachers performed together, presenting many excellent programs such as "The Party's Song," "Our Voices Fly High," "The Little Eagle of Dukagjini," and "Women's Labor Squad," singing the praises of the Party of Labor, the new life in socialist villages, and the glorious people's army. After the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor, the cultural life of the masses in Rrushen region has flourished. Recently, members of the agricultural cooperative held a cultural performance with more than 20 troupes participating, with more than 50 excellent programs receiving praise.

Based on the widespread development of mass amateur cultural activities, a large number of excellent works and talented authors have emerged nationwide. Workers from the "Stalin Textile Factory" created the play "On the Joyous Day of Electrification," reflecting the electrification of rural areas. A teacher from Puka region wrote a similar play "The Party Brings Light to the Mountains," reflecting the prosperous scene of the new countryside. An ordinary worker created the play "On the Path of Heroic Women," reflecting women's struggle against backward ideas and old customs for complete liberation. Workers from the "Guerrilla Factory" in Tirana performed the play "The Factory in Full Swing," reflecting the selfless labor spirit and high revolutionary enthusiasm of the working class during the revolutionary movement. Workers from the "Mao Zedong Textile Factory" in Përmet performed the play "Racing Against Time," reflecting revolutionary workers' communist spirit of mutual help and common growth. Recently, more than 60 amateur authors in Korça completed the creation of a long novel, a multi-act play, and some short stories and poetry collections. In an art exhibition, 25 amateur authors exhibited 95 works, enthusiastically praising the heroic figures and advanced deeds in the national liberation war and socialist revolution and construction from various angles.

The red flag of the Eagle Nation is flying high, and the revolutionary movement is flourishing. With the rising revolutionary tide, the Albanian cultural world will surely usher in an even more prosperous new situation.

    丰硕的果实
    ——记阿尔巴尼亚文化艺术在革命化运动中的丰收景象
    在亚得里亚海岸，欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义明灯放射着灿烂的光辉。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在敬爱的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的英明领导下，在劳动党第五次代表大会历史性决议的指引下，展开了轰轰烈烈的革命化运动。革命化运动，不仅推动了社会主义建设事业迅速向前发展，而且也使文学艺术呈现出一片百花争艳、硕果累累的丰收景象。
    恩维尔·霍查同志在劳动党第五次代表大会上发出响亮的号召：“文学和艺术应该成为党以社会主义和共产主义精神教育劳动者的有力武器”，“创作的中心应该是我们时代的英雄——工人、农民、战士、人民知识分子和革命干部以及党教育出来的青年人。”阿尔巴尼亚的革命文艺工作者遵循霍查同志的教导，把反映工农兵，歌唱工农兵，全心全意为工农兵服务当做自己最重要的战斗任务，通过文学、电影、美术、音乐等多种艺术形式，塑造了一大批栩栩如生的工农兵英雄人物形象。
    英雄赞歌响彻云霄
    都拉斯海港浮动起重机手亚当·雷卡，在一次暴风雨中，率领同志们与狂风恶浪搏斗了几小时，以自己的生命保卫了巨型浮动起重机，保卫了海港。亚当·雷卡树立了革命英雄主义的光辉榜样。这一家喻户晓的英雄人物吸引了广大文艺战士的注意，全国各地先后上演了歌颂雷卡的话剧《我们集体的儿子》、《风暴中的旗帜》、《党的儿子》、芭蕾舞剧《亚当·雷卡》。最近“新阿尔巴尼亚电影制片厂”又根据同一题材摄制成功艺术影片《辽阔的远方》。这部影片的上映，标志着阿尔巴尼亚电影艺术的水平达到了一个新的高度。影片以饱满的革命激情，抒情诗的格调，热情地歌颂了党的好儿子亚当·雷卡的爱国主义精神，反映了革命化运动对于改造人的灵魂所产生的巨大威力和英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民不惧艰险牺牲的革命英雄主义的本色。
    去年春天，斯大林城“林纳斯输油站”工人穆·希胡和穆·凯皮为了修筑一座特殊锅炉，把石油源源不绝地输送到全国各地，披星星，戴月亮，一连奋战了两个星期。后来在试炉的时候，突然发生了火灾，在千钧一发的紧要关头，希胡和凯皮纵身跳到火海之中，为了关闭闸门，确保锅炉和输油管的安全，光荣地献出了生命。两位英雄成了阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级的榜样，鼓舞着每一个革命者。斯大林城“石油工人”文化宫的业余演员为英雄人物编演了话剧《林纳斯的英雄》。这个剧一上演，就轰动了全国，到目前为止，地拉那、斯库台、科尔察等地都还在继续上演这个剧目，这是一曲革命英雄主义的赞歌。
    都卡吉尼的山村小姑娘什库塔·瓦塔，是革命化运动中继“社会主义劳动英雄”亚当·雷卡之后，出现的又一个著名的英雄人物。为了响应党和霍查同志的伟大号召，刚刚年满十五岁的什库塔就到洛格齐恩—费里铁路建设工地参加义务劳动。劳动中她处处走在前头，时刻关心党的事业和自己的同志。一天，在劳动工地上，她英勇地牺牲了。什库塔死后，党中央特别决议，追认她为劳动党正式党员，小英雄的父亲帕尔·瓦塔亲自到工地接女儿的班，走她未走完的道路。帕尔·瓦塔父女的名字成了爱国主义的代名词。霍查同志指出：“什库塔以她英勇果敢的行为，树立了爱国主义、英雄主义、无限热爱祖国、无限热爱劳动党和人民的光辉榜样。”帕尔·瓦塔父女的英雄行为使革命的文艺工作者无不为之感动，在短短的几个月里，诗人们写下了长诗《什库塔之歌》，《什库塔的微笑》和《纳依姆·弗拉谢里》。国家出版社还出了专集《什库塔》、《一个人倒下去，千百万人又站起来》。剧作家法蒂尔·克拉雅创作了话剧《十五岁的女共产党员》，在革命的戏剧舞台上增加了又一个新的光辉形象。
    一九六七年的十二月，这是一个英雄月，阿尔巴尼亚人民永世难忘的一月啊！迪布拉和利布拉什德区发生强烈的地震，造成了人力和物力的损失。但是英雄的人民仅仅以不到一个月的时间就修建和修复了六千三百多所建筑物，谱写了一曲响彻云霄的共产主义凯歌。在战胜地震灾害的过程中，人民表现了大无畏的革命英雄主义精神和崇高的共产主义风格。地震一发生，著名诗人阿·恰奇、小说作家彼·马尔克、德·阿果立等几十名文艺工作者冒着凛冽的寒风和漫天的大雪来到灾区，和当地群众一起劳动重建家园。人民群众的革命精神激励着他们，于是，随着房屋的修建，一大批热情奔放，鼓舞人心的优秀作品也一起问世了。如恰奇的长诗《战胜地震》，阿果立的《地震和英雄主义》，阿拉比的《在地震区》等作品得到了人民群众的高度赞扬。美术工作者法·哈基乌的油画《党啊，祝您象高山一样万寿无疆》更是难得的好作品。
    科尔察区农业社社员道松·萨底纳希闪耀着共产主义思想的光辉，为了帮助阶级弟兄重建家园，献出了生命。他死后，妻子妮菲·萨底纳希率领义务劳动队员，亲自接过丈夫的锹和铲，继续为阶级兄弟修筑房屋。科尔察《安·札·恰估比》剧院的演员在英雄人物的感召下，用了不到十天的时间，创作演出了话剧《前线》，把英雄人物搬上了舞台。“新阿尔巴尼亚电影制片厂”还赶制了纪录影片《一九六七年的十二月》，歌颂了灾区人民的革命干劲和乐观主义精神，表现了党和人民亲密无间的关系。
    彻底解放妇女的运动，已经取得了极其伟大的成就。无数敢说敢干的革命女闯将有智慧、有勇气、有魄力，打破了束缚她们的旧思想和旧习俗，朝着解放的大道迅跑。革命的文艺工作者积极投入到运动中来，创作了不少洋溢着革命激情，艺术形式新颖的佳作。话剧《山村的姑娘》、《家中的火焰》、《摧毁》、《嫁妆匣里的子弹》、《德蕾塔》等，对于敢于向旧思想旧习俗作斗争的先进妇女做了热情的赞颂。这些剧目一直活跃在舞台上，有力地推动了彻底解放妇女的群众运动。
    今年七月十日是光荣的阿尔巴尼亚人民军建军二十五周年纪念日。二十五年来，英雄的人民军在党和霍查同志的领导之下，写下了光辉灿烂的篇章。为了隆重纪念这一盛大节日，《人民之声报》、《团结报》、《光明报》、《十一月》文学月刊都用相当多的篇幅刊登民族解放战争回忆录和反映当前人民军革命化的新作品。留安·恰弗塞吉的长篇小说《向高山进军》、莱索尔·培多的《他们永远是战士》、报告文学集《在英雄主义的道路上》、艺术影片《无声的战斗》、《战胜死亡》、大型歌舞《开垦新土地》、《建设祖国、保卫祖国》、《军民一家不可分》等，描绘出一幅幅惊心动魄的战斗画面，颂扬了在社会主义建设时期广大指战员建立的新的丰功伟绩，使广大读者和观众受到了爱国主义和革命传统教育。
    描写工农兵，歌唱工农兵，成了阿尔巴尼亚文艺工作者创作的中心主题。报刊上描写工农兵英雄人物的诗歌、小说闪烁着不朽的光辉，舞台和银幕上树起高大的工农兵英雄群像。这些描写工农兵，歌唱工农兵的文艺作品鼓舞着人们更好地进行社会主义革命和建设。
    工农兵誓作文化的主人
    为了促进工农兵群众文艺活动的迅速开展，在全国各地建立了文化艺术网，现在在全国各主要城市都有“文化之家”和文艺演出团体，在农村，已经建立起一千六百多个“文化之家”。在第四个五年计划期间（一九六六——一九七○）文化艺术单位的数字将大大增加，在农村“文化之家”将发展到两千个左右，就连遥远的马蒂、米尔迪塔和人烟稀少、解放前十分落后贫穷的斯克拉伯尔区，也建立了“文化之家”和民间创作社，有十六个村庄成立了业余剧团。
    在各级党组织领导下，全国各地经常举行工农兵业余文艺会演，广大群众的才能得到了充分的发挥。不久前，地拉那区举行了规模盛大的业余文艺会演，九十个业余文艺团体，二千二百一十五名业余演员演出了四百七十个节目，观众达十四万人，几乎每个地拉那市民都看到了一场演出，创造了前所未有的纪录。四月初，斯库台区举行了农村文艺会演，十二个有名的艺术团体，一千二百多业余演员参加了演出。老人、孩子、妇女、教师一同登台表演，演出了《党之歌》、《我们的歌声满天飞扬》、《都卡吉尼的小山鹰》、《妇女劳动队》等很多精采节目，歌唱了劳动党、社会主义农村的新生活和光荣的人民军。劳动党第五次代表大会以后，鲁什涅区群众的业余文艺生活蓬勃地开展起来。不久前，农业社社员举行了二十多个文艺团体参加的文艺会演，五十多个优秀节目受到人们的好评。
    在群众业余文艺活动广泛开展的基础上，全国涌现出一大批优秀作品和有才干的作者。“斯大林纺织厂”工人创作了反映农村电气化的话剧《在实现电气化的大喜日子里》，普卡区一位教师写出了同类题材的剧本《党把光明送山乡》，反映了新农村蒸蒸日上的繁荣景象。一位普通工人创作了反映妇女为争取彻底解放，英勇地同落后思想、旧习俗作斗争的话剧《在女英雄的道路上》，地拉那“游击队工厂”的工人自编自演的话剧《热火朝天的工厂》，反映了革命化运动中工人阶级忘我的劳动精神和高昂的革命激情。培拉特
  “毛泽东纺织厂”工人自编自演了反映革命工人发扬共产主义风格，互相帮助，共同成长的话剧《和时间赛跑》。科尔察六十多名业余作者最近完成了长篇小说、多幕剧以及一些短篇小说和诗集的创作。在一次美展中二十五名业余作者展出了九十五幅作品，从各个不同方面热情地赞颂了民族解放战争和社会主义革命与建设中的英雄人物和先进事迹。
