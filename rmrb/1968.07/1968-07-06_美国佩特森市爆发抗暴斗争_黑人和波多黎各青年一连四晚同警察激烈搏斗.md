	Paterson, New Jersey, has seen four consecutive nights of violent clashes between black and Puerto Rican youth and the police. The unrest began on the evening of July 1st in protest against the police's unprovoked beating of a young man.

	The protesters have been using bricks, stones, and glass bottles to attack police and police cars from the ground and rooftops. They have also smashed the windows of white-owned stores. Some protesters have even made false fire alarms, keeping the police and firefighters busy running from one place to another.

	The police, armed to the teeth, have responded with tear gas and even gunfire. Over the first three nights, twenty people were injured and eighty-four were arrested. Hundreds of soldiers are on standby near the city.

	Despite these measures, the protests continued on July 5th and showed signs of spreading. This industrial city has a population of about 140,000, nearly half of whom are black or Puerto Rican.

    美国佩特森市爆发抗暴斗争
    黑人和波多黎各青年一连四晚同警察激烈搏斗
    新华社五日讯　华盛顿消息：新泽西州佩特森市的黑人和波多黎各青年从一日晚上起接连四个晚上进行抗暴斗争，抗议警察无端殴打一名青年。
    他们用砖头、石块、玻璃瓶从地面或屋顶上打击警察和警车，砸烂白人剥削者的商店橱窗。有的抗暴群众还假报火警，把警察和消防队愚弄得疲于奔命。
    武装警察使用催泪瓦斯，甚至开枪镇压抗暴群众。头三个晚上共二十人受伤，八十四人被捕。还有上百名军队在城市附近整装待命。
    尽管如此，五日，抗暴斗争还在继续，并且有扩大的趋势。
    这个工业城市大约有十四万人口，其中将近一半是黑人和波多黎各人。
