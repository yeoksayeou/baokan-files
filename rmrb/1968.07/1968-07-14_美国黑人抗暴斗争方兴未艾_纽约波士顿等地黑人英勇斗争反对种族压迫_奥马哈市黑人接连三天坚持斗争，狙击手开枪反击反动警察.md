The struggle of Black Americans against violence is gaining momentum. Following recent anti-violence struggles in cities like Richmond, Seattle, and Paterson, Black people in several major cities have launched new waves of resistance.

On July 10, approximately 1,500 young people, mostly Black and Puerto Rican, demonstrated in City Hall Park in New York. They carried placards and chanted slogans demanding solutions to their employment problems. They clashed with armed police sent by the reactionary authorities. The demonstrators fought back with bricks, stones, and glass bottles, injuring three police officers. Two demonstrators were unjustly arrested by the police.

In the Black residential area of North Omaha, Nebraska, on the nights of July 5, 6, and 7, Black people fought back against police brutality. The struggle on July 7 lasted three hours. To protest the unjust arrest of a young man by reactionary police, Black people threw stones at the police. When the police opened fire, Black snipers retaliated from rooftops and street corners.

The anti-violence struggle is now rapidly spreading to the southern part of the city. Fearing the further expansion of the struggle, the reactionary ruling authorities increased police patrols on July 8 and unjustly arrested a group of people.

On the night of July 3, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Black people demonstrated against the visit of former Alabama Governor and racist Wallace to deliver a campaign speech and clashed with police sent to suppress the demonstration. On July 4, angry Black youth took to the streets, throwing Molotov cocktails at white-owned buildings and smashing police car windows with stones and bricks.

On the night of July 8, in a Black residential area of Boston, Black youth launched a struggle against violence that lasted over three hours. They threw stones at the police sent to suppress them, smashed the shops of white exploiters, and injured four police officers.

To oppose the reactionary rule and racist policies of American imperialism, Black Americans are holding up large banners reading "Down with American imperialism!" and engaging in demonstrations.

    新华社十一日讯　华盛顿消息：美国黑人的抗暴斗争方兴未艾。继最近里士满、西雅图、佩特森等地的黑人抗暴斗争之后，连日来黑人群众又在一些大城市里相继掀起了新的抗暴斗争浪潮。
    十日，大约一千五百名青年，其中大多数是黑人和波多黎各人，在纽约市政厅公园举行示威。他们拿着标语牌、喊着口号，要求解决他们的就业问题。他们同反动当局派去镇压的武装警察进行了斗争。他们用砖头、石块、玻璃瓶奋力还击警察，打伤三名警察。两名示威青年被警察无理逮捕。
    在内布拉斯加州奥马哈市北部的黑人居住区，五日、六日、七日接连三个晚上爆发了黑人群众抗击警察暴行的斗争。七日的斗争持续了三个小时。为了抗议反动警察无理逮捕一名青年，黑人群众用石块投打警察。当警察向黑人开枪时，黑人狙击手也从屋顶上、从街道转角处开枪，英勇还击。
    黑人抗暴斗争目前正向这个城市的南部迅速扩大。反动统治当局害怕斗争进一步扩大，在八日增派了警察进行巡逻，并无理逮捕了一批群众。
    三日晚上，在明尼苏达州的明尼阿波利斯，黑人为了抗议前亚拉巴马州州长、种族主义者华莱士前去发表竞选演说而举行示威，并且同派去镇压示威的警察进行搏斗。四日，愤怒的黑人青年又涌上街头，向白人建筑物投掷燃烧瓶，用石块和砖头砸警车玻璃。
    八日晚上，在波士顿的一个黑人居住区，黑人青年也掀起了一场持续三个多钟头的抗暴斗争。他们用石块投打镇压他们的警察，捣毁白人剥削者的商店，打伤四名警察。（附图片）
