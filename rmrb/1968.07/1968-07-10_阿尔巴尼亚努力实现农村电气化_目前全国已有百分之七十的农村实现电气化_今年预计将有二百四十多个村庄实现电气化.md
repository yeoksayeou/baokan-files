Albania is making great efforts to achieve rural electrification. Currently, 70% of the villages across the country have been electrified. This year, it is expected that an additional 244 villages will be electrified.

According to a report by the Albanian News Agency, under the care of the people's government, Albania has already electrified 70% of its villages. This year, it is anticipated that 244 more villages will be electrified. Among these, 108 villages will obtain electricity through the construction of small hydroelectric and thermal power stations, while the remaining villages will be connected to the national unified power grid through high-voltage transmission lines.

To meet the needs of nationwide rural electrification, workers across the country are accelerating the production of motors, turbines, transformers, and electrical materials. Existing wire factories are undergoing expansion, and three factories producing concrete power poles are under construction. Once these factories are completed and operational, Albania's production of concrete power poles will increase four to five times compared to 1967. The workers building these factories are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, ensuring that the factory buildings will be completed this year and machine installation will begin.

Meanwhile, workers in the existing concrete power pole factories are also highly motivated. They aim to double the production of concrete power poles this year. Currently, many heavy trucks loaded with concrete power poles are being transported from Tirana to various parts of the country every day.

Currently, all parts of Albania are working hard to fulfill the decision of the Albanian Labor Party to achieve nationwide rural electrification by November 8, 1971, the 30th anniversary of the party's founding. Albania has already electrified 70% of its villages. The image shows high-voltage transmission lines in an electrified mountainous area of Albania.

    阿尔巴尼亚努力实现农村电气化
    目前全国已有百分之七十的农村实现电气化
    今年预计将有二百四十多个村庄实现电气化
    新华社地拉那电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：目前，阿尔巴尼亚全国各地，正在为加紧实现阿尔巴尼亚劳动党关于在一九七一年十一月八日建党三十周年之际实现全国农村电气化的决议而努力。
    在人民政权的关怀下，阿尔巴尼亚已有百分之七十的村庄实现了电气化。今年，预计又将有二百四十四个村庄实现电气化。其中，将有一百零八个村庄通过建立小型水电站和火力发电站得到电力，其余村庄将由国家统一电力系统的高压输电线送电。
    为了满足全国实现农村电气化的需要，各地职工正在加紧生产马达、透平机、变压器和电器材料。现有的电线工厂已开始扩建，三个生产混凝土电线杆的工厂也正在兴建之中。这些工厂落成和投入生产以后，阿尔巴尼亚混凝土电线杆的产量，将比一九六七年提高四到五倍。建筑这些工厂的工人以高涨的革命热情保证今年将完成厂房的建设，并开始安装机器。
    与此同时，现有生产混凝土电线杆的工厂的工人更是干劲十足。他们争取今年把混凝土电线杆的产量提高一倍。目前，每天都有许多重型卡车满载混凝土电线杆，从地拉那运往全国各地。（附图片）
