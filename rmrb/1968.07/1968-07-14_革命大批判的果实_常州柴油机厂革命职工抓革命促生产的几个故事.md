The great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the formulation of the "Sixteen Points," which states: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country." The revolutionary workers of the Changzhou Diesel Engine Factory, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, through a thorough criticism of the revisionist management line of the Chinese Khrushchev, firmly established Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, bringing about a completely new situation in both revolution and production throughout the factory. The following are a few stories of how the revolutionary workers in the engine workshop of this factory have grasped the revolution and promoted production.

Three Hundred Machines Revived

The machine body group had long been plagued by an unsolved problem: every machine body required drilling dozens of screw holes. If a screw tap broke off inside a hole, the machine body would be scrapped. Due to this issue, over the past two years, more than three hundred machine bodies had become waste. Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the so-called "experts" and "authorities" in the factory paid no heed to the loss of state property or the labor of the workers. The machine body group workers repeatedly sought their help to solve this problem, but the response was always, "What's the big deal about scrapping? Just melt it down and recast it." During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary masses criticized the bourgeois "authorities" and the revisionist notion of "expert rule." The great criticism invigorated everyone, and they decided not to rely on the "authorities" but to solve the problem themselves. After repeated research, they successfully developed a simple "electric spark" machine that could retrieve broken screw taps from the holes. This not only revived more than three hundred scrapped machine bodies but also significantly increased the production of machine bodies. In May alone, they produced seven hundred and four machine bodies.

Small Parts Shining and Productivity Soaring

A diesel engine contains numerous small parts, each with tiny burrs that need to be polished and smoothed by hand after being machined on a lathe. Even a highly skilled worker could only polish three to four hundred parts a day, severely limiting production.

The so-called technical "authorities" in the factory never bothered to think about this problem. Under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the broad revolutionary masses, through the great criticism, invigorated their revolutionary spirit. They learned a new method of vibration deburring from another factory, ultimately increasing productivity by about twelve times.

Cold Extrusion Replaces Cutting

The production of a diesel engine inevitably involves various screws and pins, which were previously all machined on lathes, consuming both labor and materials. The standard parts group had long wanted to switch to cold extrusion to produce these parts. In the past, they had suggested this, but some engineers, citing books and calculations, said that a 200-ton hydraulic press was needed to extrude the adjusting screws for the rocker arms, and even a 40-ton hydraulic press was required for ordinary pins. The factory only had two 25-ton hydraulic presses. As a result, the workers' suggestions were shelved and ignored for a long time.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary masses, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle in the world can be created," broke through superstitions and fostered a daring and revolutionary spirit. After numerous experiments, they successfully used the existing equipment to produce screws and pins through cold extrusion. Now, this method is used to mass-produce screws and pins, doubling productivity and saving 66% of steel materials.

The revolutionary spirit of the broad revolutionary workers of the Changzhou Diesel Engine Factory, unleashed during the Cultural Revolution, is transforming into a tremendous material force driving production. This year, the factory's production has been steadily increasing month by month. (Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing)

    革命大批判的果实
    ——常州柴油机厂革命职工抓革命促生产的几个故事
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”中指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”常州柴油机厂革命职工在无产阶级文化大革命中，通过狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义办厂路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，使全厂革命、生产出现了崭新的局面。下面是这个厂发动机车间革命职工抓革命、促生产的几个故事。
    三百多台报废机身复活
    机身小组长期有一个难题得不到解决，就是每一台机身都要钻几十个螺丝孔，一旦在攻某一个螺丝孔时，螺丝公断进孔里，这个机身就要报废。因为这个原因，两年来有三百多台机身成为废品。无产阶级文化大革命之前，厂里的那些所谓“专家”“权威”，对于国家资财的损失，对于工人们所付出的劳动，根本没有放在眼里。机身小组的工人多次找他们去解决这个问题，得到的回答却是“报废有什么了不起，拿去重新熔化浇铸一下就是了”。在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命职工批判了资产阶级的反动“权威”和“专家治厂”等修正主义黑货。革命大批判使大家意气风发，精神振奋，决心不靠“权威”，自己动手来解决问题。他们经过反复研究，终于试制出一种能把断进孔里的螺丝公重新取出来的简单的“电火花”机，不仅使三百多台报废的机身复活了，而且大大提高了机身的产量，仅五月份他们就生产了七百零四台机身。
    光洁小零件工效大提高
    一台柴油机上，有许许多多小零件，这些零件，从车床上车出来的时候，都有许多小毛刺，要通过工人的手把它一个个的磨光、修平。一个很熟练的工人，一天通常也只能修三、四百只，大大影响了产量的提高。
    这个厂的那些所谓技术“权威”，从来也不愿意在这个问题上动脑筋。广大革命职工，在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，通过革命大批判，振奋了革命精神。他们学习了外厂的震动去毛刺的新方法，终于把工效比以往提高了十二倍左右。
    冷挤压代替了切削法
    一台柴油机的产生，总离不开许多各式各样的螺丝、提销，这些零件过去都是靠车床切削出来的，既费工，又费料。标准件小组早就想改用冷挤压的办法，把零件挤出来，压出来。过去，他们提过这样的建议，可是有的工程师搬出本本，大笔一算，说是需要二百吨压力的油压机才能压得出摇臂调整螺丝钉，就是压一个普通的提销也要四十吨压力的油压机才行。而厂里只有两架二十五吨压力的油压机。结果，工人们的建议被长期搁下，无人过问。
    无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命职工遵照毛主席的“在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来”的教导，破除迷信，发扬敢想敢干的革命精神。经过多次试验，终于用现有的设备试验成功了用冷挤压的办法来生产螺丝、提销。现在已用这一办法成批生产螺丝、提销，工效提高一倍，节约钢材百分之六十六。
    常州柴油机厂的广大革命职工在文化大革命中焕发出来的革命精神，正在变成推动生产的巨大物质力量。今年以来，全厂产量月月上升。　（新华社南京电）
