	To Fight for the Life of Mao Zedong's Revolutionary Line

	Dear Chairman Mao, I received the notice to come to your side for study, and I am so excited that I haven't slept for several nights. I can't help but stand in front of your portrait again and again, recalling the past and thinking about the present. There are so many heartfelt words I want to tell you and so many passionate songs I want to sing for you! Dear Chairman Mao, it is your brilliant thoughts that have illuminated my path forward. Over the past twenty years, I have been transformed from a poor laborer into a conscious proletarian warrior, all thanks to your nurturing and education. On June 30th, I was once again fortunate to receive your warm reception. With tears of excitement welling up in my eyes, I repeatedly wish you a long life! Long life! Long life!

	In 1947, during a battle in Luoyang, we were outnumbered by the enemy. I led a platoon to carry out a blocking mission on a flank position. To ensure the completion of the mission, we fought a bloody battle against the enemy for six days and seven nights. It was your brilliant thoughts that gave us the courage and strength to face any challenge, to dare to climb the mountains of knives and to dare to leap into the sea of fire. No matter how powerful the enemy was, we could defeat them. At that time, a soldier lay in a pool of blood, and before he died, he tightly grasped my hand and said, "For Chairman Mao, for socialism, you must hold the position and not give up even an inch of land to the enemy!" It was with this spirit that we overcame all kinds of unimaginable difficulties and successfully completed the mission.

	Dear Chairman Mao, you taught us, "After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies." In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we always remember your teachings and never relax our vigilance against class enemies. In the struggle against enemies without guns, we have achieved new victories. Over the past year, our regiment has firmly believed in and relied on the masses in our support-left work. Together with the revolutionary masses of the support-left units, we have continuously launched attacks on class enemies, exposed a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, unearthed a group of traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries hidden within the revolutionary ranks, and eliminated the remnants of the Kuomintang, dealing a heavy blow to the class enemies.

	Dear Chairman Mao, in the years of war, to execute and defend your revolutionary line, we carried forward the revolutionary spirit of being the spearhead and the vanguard; in the period of socialist revolution, in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I am determined to continue carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of being the spearhead and the vanguard, to better learn and apply your thoughts, to strive to reform my worldview, and to be like Comrade Deng Zihui: thinking of everything for Chairman Mao, submitting to everything for Chairman Mao, following everything for Chairman Mao, and doing everything for Chairman Mao. In the class struggle, I will continuously temper my loyalty to you, and for the execution and defense of your revolutionary line, I will fight for life.

    为捍卫毛主席的革命路线战斗终生
    兰州部队活学活用毛主席著作积极分子、某部政委　梁振全
    敬爱的毛主席，我接到到您身边学习的通知，兴奋得几个晚上都没有合眼。我情不自禁地一次又一次地站在您老人家的像前，回忆过去，想着现在，有多少贴心的话儿要对您讲，有多少热情的歌儿要给您唱！敬爱的毛主席啊，是您光辉的思想，照亮了我前进的方向。二十多年来，我从一个贫苦的长工，锻炼成为一个有觉悟的无产阶级战士，那一点不是您老人家的培养和教育的结果。六月三十日，我又接受了您老人家的亲切接见。我含着满眶激动的热泪，一遍又一遍地祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    一九四七年在洛阳战役的一次阻击作战中，敌众我寡，我带领一个班，负责一个侧面点上的阻击任务。为了保证任务的完成，同敌人进行了六天七夜的浴血奋战。是您老人家的光辉思想，使我们浑身是胆，全身是劲，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，再强大的敌人也能战胜。当时有个战士倒在血泊中，牺牲前还紧握着我的手说：“为了毛主席，为了社会主义，你们要坚守阵地，不能丢给敌人半寸土地！”就是这样，我们克服了各种难以想象的困难，出色地完成了战斗任务。
    敬爱的毛主席，您教导我们说：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们时刻牢记着您的教导，一刻也没有放松对阶级敌人的警惕。在和不拿枪的敌人的斗争中，又取得了新的胜利。一年多来，我们团在支左工作中，坚决相信和依靠群众，同支左单位的无产阶级革命派一起，不停顿地向阶级敌人发动进攻，揪出了党内一小撮走资派，挖出了一批隐藏在革命队伍内部的叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子，清除了国民党的残渣余孽，给了阶级敌人以沉重的打击。
    敬爱的毛主席啊，在战争年代里，为了执行和捍卫您老人家的革命路线，我们发扬了当尖刀、打头阵的革命精神；在社会主义革命时期，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中，我决心继续发扬当尖刀、打头阵的革命精神，更好地活学活用您的思想，努力改造世界观，象门合同志那样：一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席。在阶级斗争中不断锤炼对您老人家的忠心，为执行和捍卫您的革命路线，战斗终生。
