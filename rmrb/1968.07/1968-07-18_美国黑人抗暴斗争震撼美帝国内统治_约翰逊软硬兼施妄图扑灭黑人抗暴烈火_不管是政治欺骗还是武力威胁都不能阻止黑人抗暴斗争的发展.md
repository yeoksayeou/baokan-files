The surging tide of the black struggle against violence in the U.S. is shaking the domestic rule of U.S. imperialism, dealing it a heavy blow both at home and abroad. The U.S. ruling class, in order to maintain its reactionary rule, is intensifying its counter-revolutionary tactics of political deception and violent suppression, in a vain attempt to extinguish the flames of the black struggle against violence in the U.S.

As early as the summer of 1967, after the blacks in Detroit rose up in a large-scale struggle against violence to resist police brutality, U.S. President Johnson appointed a special committee to study the issue of black struggles. After eight months of planning, this committee submitted a report in February and March of this year, advocating the intensified use of political and economic deception to "alleviate" black resistance. After the U.S. ruling class used force to brutally suppress the nationwide black struggle against violence in April, Johnson immediately boasted about signing the so-called "1968 Civil Rights Act" in the White House, claiming that the signing of the "1968 Civil Rights Act" was his "proudest moment" as president. This act attempts to use the so-called "prohibition of racial discrimination in the sale and rental of housing" as a blank check to extinguish the flames of the black struggle. However, the trick of using empty "civil rights acts" to "alleviate" black struggles has long been seen through by the black masses. Some black leaders have pointed out that the "1968 Civil Rights Act" is a "deception of the blacks." Johnson also declared that he plans to propose some "welfare" plans to Congress, such as increasing school meal subsidies and improving the so-called "food stamp program" for the poor. However, this attempt to divert the attention of the black struggle with small favors is becoming less and less effective.

While Johnson is desperately boasting about the "1968 Civil Rights Act," the reactionary ruling authorities in the U.S. are taking various measures to intensify the preparation for suppressing the black struggle against violence in the U.S. The U.S. Department of Defense announced in late April the establishment of a "Special Command Center" within the Pentagon to control "riots," responsible for formulating plans and commanding the active-duty troops to suppress the struggle against violence. The U.S. Army sent personnel to inspect nearly a hundred cities and formulated specific plans to suppress "riots" in each city. It also increased the number of "special task forces" for suppressing the struggle against violence from seven to twelve. Each of these so-called "special task forces" has about 2,000 personnel, totaling around 25,000. They spend most of their time undergoing special training for "anti-riot" operations. In addition, the reactionary ruling authorities in the U.S. are strengthening the training of military police and reserve troops tasked with suppression, and are stockpiling weapons, including heavy equipment and new weapons, for suppressing the people in some important city areas.

Recently, Johnson has also used the assassination of Senator Robert Kennedy to advocate for controlling civilian weapons. He has already pushed Congress to pass a law controlling the sale of handguns and plans to control the sale of long guns and implement the registration of private firearms. This move is obviously, to a great extent, aimed at weakening the armed struggle of the black masses against violence. The head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Hoover, also revealed that he has sent agents to infiltrate radical black organizations for espionage and sabotage.

However, regardless of whether the Johnson administration uses political deception or threats of force, it cannot stop the development of the black struggle against violence in the U.S. As Lenin once pointed out: "Once the masses rise up, no force in the world can stop them."

    美国黑人抗暴斗争震撼美帝国内统治
    约翰逊软硬兼施妄图扑灭黑人抗暴烈火
    不管是政治欺骗还是武力威胁都不能阻止黑人抗暴斗争的发展
    本报讯　汹涌澎湃的美国黑人抗暴斗争怒潮震撼着美帝国主义的国内统治，给内外交困的美帝国主义以极其沉重的打击。美国统治集团为了维护反动统治，正加紧玩弄政治欺骗和暴力镇压的反革命两手策略，妄图扑灭美国黑人抗暴斗争的烈火。
    早在一九六七年夏天，底特律黑人为抗击警察暴行而掀起大规模抗暴斗争以后，美国总统约翰逊就任命了一个专门委员会研究对付黑人斗争问题。这个委员会经过八个月的策划，在今年二、三月间提出了一份报告，主张加紧使用政治经济欺骗手段以“缓和”黑人反抗。四月间美国统治集团用武力血腥镇压了席卷全国的美国黑人抗暴斗争以后，约翰逊立即大吹大擂地在白宫签署了所谓“一九六八年民权法案”，说什么“一九六八年民权法案”的签署是他“担任总统职务时期最骄傲的时刻”。这个法案，妄图以所谓“禁止在出售和出租房屋时实行种族歧视”的空头支票，来平息美国黑人斗争的怒火。但是，美国历届总统为了“缓和”黑人斗争而玩弄有名无实的“民权法案”这套鬼把戏，早已被黑人群众所识破。一些黑人领袖指出，“一九六八年民权法案”，“是对黑人的欺骗”。约翰逊还宣称：打算向国会提出一些“福利”计划，例如提高公立学校的伙食津贴、改进所谓救济贫困居民的“食品票计划”等等。但是这种企图用小恩小惠来转移黑人斗争视线的办法，也越来越不灵了。
    就在约翰逊拚命吹嘘“一九六八年民权法案”的同时，美国反动统治当局采取了各种措施，加紧准备镇压美国黑人抗暴斗争。美国国防部四月下旬宣布，在五角大楼内建立控制“暴乱”的“特别指挥部中心”，负责制订计划和指挥镇压抗暴斗争的现役部队。美国陆军当局向九十几个城市派出人员进行视察，并分别制定镇压“暴乱”的具体方案。它还把镇压抗暴斗争的七支“特遣部队”增至十二支。这些所谓“特遣部队”，每支约二千人，总共二万五千人左右。他们平时用较多时间专门进行“反暴动”的特殊训练。此外，美国反动统治当局还加强训练执行镇压任务的军警和后备役部队，并加紧在一些重要城市地区储存供镇压人民群众用的军火，包括重型装备和新式武器。
    最近，约翰逊又利用参议员罗伯特·肯尼迪被枪杀的事件，鼓吹要控制民间的武器。他已促使国会通过了一项控制出售手枪的法案，还打算控制出售长枪，并实施私人枪枝的登记。这种做法，在很大程度上显然是为了要削弱黑人群众的武力抗暴斗争的。联邦调查局的头子胡佛还透露，他派遣了特务混入激进的黑人组织进行刺探和破坏。
    但是，约翰逊政府不管用政治欺骗也好，用武力威胁也好，都不能遏止美国黑人群众抗暴斗争的发展。正如列宁曾经指出的：“一旦群众站立起来，世界上任何力量都阻挡不住他们”。
