	Colleges must still be run, and I am mainly talking about colleges of science and technology. However, the length of schooling must be shortened, education must be revolutionized, and proletarian politics must take command. We should follow the path of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in training technical personnel from among the workers. Students should be selected from workers and peasants who have practical experience, come to school for a few years of study, and then return to production practice.

    毛主席语录
