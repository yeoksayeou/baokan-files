Chairman Mao's latest instructions not only point out the direction of the educational revolution but also the direction of the scientific and technological revolution. We resolutely follow the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers as indicated by Chairman Mao, and will carry out the scientific and technological revolution to the end.

For a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents have been promoting a bourgeois scientific and technological line in our research units. The Chinese Khrushchev said things like: "You should work hard," "You should be an engineer," "You should make a name for yourself." The agents of the Chinese Khrushchev, following their black master, vigorously advocated for "technology first," urging young technicians to bow down to the feet of bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities." They looked down upon workers, peasants, and soldiers, and even those who graduated from technical schools were considered to have "no future" and were excluded. They strongly opposed emphasizing proletarian politics, using the excuse of "creating research conditions" to stipulate that scientific and technical personnel could not participate in physical training, clean up, or even listen to political reports and attend political meetings. Under the poisonous influence of this revisionist scientific and technological line, some people took the path of becoming bourgeois experts, struggling for personal fame and gain. They spent all day in small rooms looking for "books," checking "data," learning "foreign languages," and writing "papers," yearning for the title of "associate professor." After working for more than ten years, they ended up achieving nothing and took the path of bourgeois deviation.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history." "The people have limitless creative power." Once, in the trial production of a certain piece of equipment, we initially, due to being detached from the masses and reality, designed an anchor according to old doctrines. It took four years and multiple trials, all of which failed, resulting in significant waste. Later, following Chairman Mao's teachings to go deep among the masses and into reality, we learned from the workers. With the help of local veteran workers, we revised the design, and as a result, the trial production was successful in a short time. The weight was reduced by two-thirds compared to the original, making it convenient to operate and use, saving the state more than 40,000 yuan in one go.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The most intelligent and most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." This is an absolute truth. In a certain experiment, the insulation problem of the conductive system was a long-standing difficult issue that had not been solved. Later, under the guidance of veteran workers with practical experience, not only was the insulation problem of the conductive system well solved, but it also saved the state more than 200,000 yuan. Such examples deeply educated us: "Intellectuals, if they do not combine with the workers and peasants, will achieve nothing."

The latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao have shown us, the engineering and technical and scientific research personnel, the direction to move forward. We must follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow the counter-revolutionary revisionist scientific and technological line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev, eliminate its poisonous influence, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform of our unit. We will strive to build a highly proletarianized, highly revolutionary scientific and technological team that is both red and expert.

    科学技术革命的方向
    铁道兵科研单位
    毛主席的最新指示不仅指出了教育革命的方向，而且指出了科技革命的方向。我们坚决走毛主席指出的同工农兵相结合的道路，把科技革命进行到底。
    长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，在我们科研单位推行了一条资产阶级的科技路线。中国赫鲁晓夫说什么：你们要“埋头苦干”，“要当工程师”，“要成名成家”。中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人，也追随其黑主子，极力鼓吹“技术第一”，要青年技术人员拜倒在资产阶级反动学术“权威”的脚下。他们根本看不起工人、农民和战士，连中技学校毕业的青年技术人员，也认为“没有发展前途”，而加以排斥。他们极力反对突出无产阶级政治，以“创造研究工作条件”为名，规定科技人员可以不出操，不打扫卫生，甚至可以不听政治报告，不参加政治会议。在这条修正主义的科技路线毒害下，有些人走上了为个人名利而奋斗的白专道路。他们成天关在小房子里找“本本”，查“数据”，学“洋文”，写“论文”，一心向往“副博士”的头衔，搞了十几年，结果一事无成，走上了资产阶级的邪路。
    毛主席教导我们说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“人民群众有无限的创造力。”一次，我们在试制某项设备中，开始由于脱离群众，脱离实际，按照旧教条，设计了一种锚，花了四年的时间，试验多次都失败了，浪费很大。后来，我们遵照毛主席深入群众、深入实际的教导，拜工人为师，在当地老工人的帮助下，修改了设计，结果在很短的时间内便试制成功了，重量比原来减轻了三分之二，操作使用方便，一次就为国家节约了四万多元。
    毛主席教导我们说：“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”这是千真万确的真理。我们在某项试验中，导电系统绝缘问题是长期没有解决的老大难问题。后来在有实践经验的老工人指导下，不仅很好地解决了导电系统绝缘问题，而且还为国家节约二十多万元。这样的事例深深地教育了我们：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。”
    伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，给我们工程技术、科学研究人员指明了前进的方向。我们一定要遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，高举革命的批判大旗，把中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的反革命修正主义科技路线批深、批透、批倒、批臭，肃清其毒害，搞好本单位斗、批、改，为建设一支非常无产阶级化，非常革命化的又红又专的科技队伍而努力奋斗。
