	The Poison of Material Incentives
	Beijing Railway Station Ticket Office Ticket Seller Liu Huacheng

	Lenin said, "To work just for money—that is the morality of the capitalist world." Material incentives are a corrupting agent for the working class. China's Khrushchev is the mastermind behind this corrupting agent. He said, "To mobilize the initiative of localities, departments, and enterprises, there should be some freedom, and there should be a reward system. It is not necessary to reward with products; rewarding with money is also acceptable."

	The master calls, and the lackeys follow. China's Khrushchev's agents in the railway department loudly proclaim, "If material rewards are not emphasized, how can workers be enthusiastic? How can that enthusiasm be sustained?" They vigorously promote the black goods of money-first and material incentives, implementing various reward schemes such as piecework bonuses and over-fulfillment bonuses, and calling it "mobilizing the production enthusiasm of employees." Even when a train arrives on time at our station, each employee is rewarded with three fen. They talk about everything except emphasizing proletarian politics, studying Chairman Mao's works, and the revolutionization of people's thinking. As a result, some people become more confused the more they are rewarded, drowning in the poison of bonuses and deeply affected by it.

	In 1964, when I was working in the ticket office, I was once deceived by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the railway department, allowing money to cloud my judgment. Once, while selling tickets, I encountered a group buying 696 tickets. Originally, one ticket stub would have sufficed, but for the sake of my piecework bonus, I processed it as 696 individual passenger tickets. This not only caused waste but also added trouble for the passengers and increased the burden on the ticket punchers.

	Through the tumultuous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we revolutionary employees, filled with boundless class love for the great leader Chairman Mao, took Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, and deeply carried out revolutionary criticism. Through revolutionary criticism, I realized that this was not just a matter of a few yuan in bonuses, but a major issue of struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads.

	Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we drove away imperialism and overthrew the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Only then did the working class become the masters. I love Chairman Mao and the new society from the bottom of my heart. However, China's Khrushchev and his agents want to corrupt us workers with money, lead us astray, and change the color of our country. How evil their intentions are!

	We are Chairman Mao's good workers. We have a heart that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao. To defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we must bravely stand up and fight against China's Khrushchev and his agents. During the January storm last year, a handful of capitalist roaders in the railway department stirred up a counter-revolutionary economic wind, using the pretext of "promoting production" to double the New Year's overtime pay, attempting to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We workers are the main force of the cultural revolution, the most loyal to Chairman Mao. To defend Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the revolutionary employees of our station fought against this counter-revolutionary economic wind. We finally won. The two years of practice in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have made me deeply realize: doing revolution is about emphasizing proletarian politics and relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	Now, the revolutionary employees of Beijing Station, through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, have greatly raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. We consciously demand of ourselves the standard of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people set by Chairman Mao. In the waiting room, we have set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, actively propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and the entire station is filled with a revolutionary atmosphere. Previously, in the ticket office, we often made mistakes while competing for piecework and rewards. Now, as we gradually establish the idea of serving the people, we make fewer mistakes. This is a powerful response to China's Khrushchev and his agents in the railway department who are pushing for money-first and material incentives.

    搞臭物质刺激
    北京站售票车间售票员  刘化臣
    列宁说：“做事就是为了拿钱，——这是资本主义世界的道德。”物质刺激是对工人阶级的一种腐蚀剂。中国赫鲁晓夫就是炮制这种腐蚀剂的总后台。他说：“要发挥地方、部门、企业的积极性，要有点小自由，要有奖励制度，不一定奖产品，奖钱也可以。”
    主子一呼，奴才紧跟。中国赫鲁晓夫在铁道部门的代理人，就大肆叫嚣：“不重视物质奖励，工人能积极吗？那个积极性能持久吗？”他们积极推销金钱挂帅、物质刺激的黑货，实行计件奖、超额奖等十多种奖励办法，并美其名曰：“调动职工的生产积极性”。在我们车站上就连火车正点到达一次，每个职工还奖励三分钱。他们什么都谈，就是不谈突出无产阶级政治，不谈学习毛主席著作，不谈人的思想革命化。结果，有的人越奖越糊涂，整天沉浸在奖金的毒药之中，受毒很深。
    一九六四年，我在售票车间工作，曾一度受了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁道部门的代理人的蒙蔽，让金钱蒙住了眼睛。一次，我在售票当中，碰到一个团体单位购买六百九十六人的车票，本来办一张票证可以了，可是我为了自己得计件奖，就把它办理成六百九十六张旅客单张单人客票。这样不但是一种浪费，而且给旅客增添了麻烦，给剪票人员增添了负担。
    经过轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，我们广大革命职工，满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的阶级感情，以毛主席最新指示为纲，深入开展了革命的大批判。通过革命的大批判，使我认识到，这不只是几块钱奖金的问题，而是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的大是大非问题。
    毛主席领导咱们全国人民赶走了帝国主义，推翻了国民党反动统治，我们工人阶级才当了家，做了主人。我打心眼里热爱伟大领袖毛主席，热爱新社会。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，却妄想用金钱来腐蚀我们工人，把我们往邪路上引，使我们国家变颜色，用心何其毒也！
    我们是毛主席的好工人，我们有一颗永远忠于毛主席的红心，为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线，我们一定要勇敢地站出来同中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人斗争。在去年一月风暴的日子里，铁道部门的一小撮走资派刮起了一股反革命经济主义黑风，他们打着“促生产”的幌子，把新年加班费增加一倍，妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命。我们工人阶级是文化大革命的主力军，最忠于毛主席，为捍卫毛泽东思想，捍卫毛主席的革命路线，我站广大革命职工，和这股反革命经济主义黑风进行了斗争。我们终于胜利了。两年来的无产阶级文化大革命的实践，使我深深体会到：干革命就是要靠突出无产阶级政治，就是要靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    现在，我们北京站广大革命职工，通过活学活用毛主席著作，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟有了很大的提高，自觉地以毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的标准要求自己，我们在候车室里，大办毛泽东思想学习班，积极宣传毛主席的最新指示，全站到处是一片革命景象。我们售票车间以前为了争计件、争奖励，不断出差错。现在，由于逐步树立了为人民服务的思想，很少出差错。这是给中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁道部门的代理人大搞金钱挂帅、物质刺激的有力回击。
