The counter-revolutionary collusion between the US and the Soviet Union extends from the ground to the sky. The new Soviet leadership's betrayal is more brazen and shameless.

New York to Moscow Direct Flight Line Opens Amid US Cheers

US leaders personally greet the plane at the airport, shouting that the US and the Soviet Union should "meet" in their hearts. Soviet officials shamelessly claim that this flight line connects the US and the Soviet Union.

New York, July 17 (Xinhua) — After the Soviet revisionists and the US imperialists recently finalized the US-Soviet aviation agreement, the New York-Moscow direct flight line officially began operations on July 15. On that day, the first Soviet "Ilyushin-62" aircraft from Moscow landed in New York, and an American "Boeing-707" aircraft immediately departed from New York to Moscow. The so-called "passengers" on both sides were mostly high-ranking government and military officials. This is another step in the recent tightening of collusion between the US and the Soviet Union.

Both the Soviet revisionists and the US imperialists attach great importance to the opening of this flight line. Recently, Soviet newspapers, news agencies, and radio stations have conducted extensive propaganda and reporting to hype up the US-Soviet air travel. On July 15, the Soviet aviation company in New York placed a full-page advertisement in American newspapers, announcing the opening of the New York-Moscow flight line and promising to provide the best service conditions for "travelers" from US imperialism.

The US imperialists are even more ecstatic about the active betrayal of the Soviet revisionists. When the Soviet aircraft arrived in New York, US President Johnson specially sent the US official representative, Deputy Secretary of State Rostow, to the airport to welcome them. At the so-called "celebration ceremony," Rostow extensively advocated for US-Soviet "cooperation." He emphasized that the foreign policy of the Johnson administration is to achieve a "meeting of hearts" between the US and the Soviet Union. Johnson's goal is to solve US-Soviet problems through a "quiet process, one by one, step by step." Rostow pointed out with satisfaction that the recent signing of the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty" jointly concocted by the US and the Soviet Union and the initial agreement reached on the so-called negotiations to limit nuclear weapons are two "giant steps forward" made by the two countries recently, which will definitely have an impact on all aspects of their future "cooperation." He said that the official opening of the Moscow-New York flight line brings hope for even stronger connections between the US and the Soviet Union in the future.

Bissikin, the head of the International Relations Department of the Soviet Civil Aviation Department, who led the Soviet delegation, humbly expressed his "complete agreement with Mr. Rostow's views" and openly declared that the New York-Moscow flight line has opened an important channel for the development of greater mutual contact between the US and the Soviet Union.

On July 16, when the US aircraft arrived at the Moscow airport, the Soviet revisionists also held a celebration ceremony. In his welcome speech, Bugayev, the head of the Soviet Civil Aviation Department, shouted that the opening of this flight line connects the Soviet revisionists and US imperialists, which will "enhance" the "friendship" between the two countries and promote "mutual understanding."

The two former US ambassadors to the Soviet Union, Bohlen and Kohler, who accompanied the US aircraft to Moscow, also spoke. Bohlen emphasized that "this is a historic event—the opening of the flight line will generally improve our relations."

In recent periods, the Soviet revisionist clique, in order to adapt to the needs of US imperialism, has accelerated the pace of US-Soviet collusion at an unprecedented speed. During this period, the US and the Soviet Union signed the "Non-Proliferation Treaty," established a "nuclear umbrella," reached an initial agreement on the so-called negotiations to limit nuclear weapons, approved the long-stalled US-Soviet consular agreement, supplemented and amended the aviation agreement signed by the two countries a year ago, and quickly established the Moscow-New York flight line. On the same day that the US-Soviet direct flight line began its first operation, the US and the Soviet Union signed a 1968-1969 cultural exchange agreement with extremely broad content.

All these facts show that since the secret talks between the Soviet revisionists and US leaders in Glassboro last year, the collusion between the Soviet revisionists and US imperialism has deepened. In this regard, the new Soviet leadership has been more brazen, more open, more frequent, more urgent, and more shameless than their predecessor, Khrushchev, fully exposing their traitorous faces as the number one henchmen and loyal servants of US imperialism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Those who are determined to be led by the nose by US imperialism will ultimately become martyrs for US imperialism." The Soviet revisionist traitors will absolutely not escape this shameful fate.

    美苏反革命勾结从地上到天空　苏修新领导叛卖更露骨更无耻
    纽约——莫斯科直达航线在美帝喝采声中开航
    美帝头目亲临机场欢迎，叫嚷美苏两国要在心灵中实现“会合”
    苏修官员厚颜无耻声称这条航线的开辟把美帝苏修“联结在一起”
    新华社十七日讯　苏修和美帝不久前就苏美航空协定拍板成交之后，于十五日正式使用纽约—莫斯科直达航线。当天苏修第一次从莫斯科飞往纽约的“伊尔—62”型客机到达纽约后，美国“波音—707”客机立刻离开纽约飞往莫斯科。双方的所谓“乘客”绝大部分是政府和军队的高级官员。这是苏美最近一个时期加紧勾结的又一个步骤。
    苏修和美帝都十分重视这条航线的正式通航。最近苏修的报刊、通讯社和电台做了大量的宣传报道，为苏美通航进行渲染和鼓吹。十五日，苏修驻纽约的航空公司专门在美国报纸上登出整版的巨幅广告，宣布纽约—莫斯科航线开始通航，并表示保证向美帝国主义的“旅行者”提供最好的服务条件。
    美帝对苏修的积极叛卖，更是兴高采烈。美帝头子约翰逊在苏修的客机到达纽约时，专门派美国官方代表、副国务卿罗斯托到机场欢迎。罗斯托在所谓“庆祝典礼”上大肆鼓吹美苏“合作”。他强调说，约翰逊政府的外交政策，就是要使美苏两国之间在心灵中实现“会合”。约翰逊的目标是通过“静悄悄的过程，一个一个地，一步一步地解决”美苏之间的问题。罗斯托满意地指出，不久前美苏共同炮制的“防止核扩散条约”的签订和美苏达成就所谓限制核武器问题举行的初步谈判的协议，是最近美苏两国“作出的两个巨大的前进步骤”，它们必定对今后两国“合作”事业的“一切方面发生影响”。他说，莫斯科—纽约航线的正式通航，给美苏“未来的甚至更有力的联系带来了希望”。
    率领苏修旅行团的苏联民航部国际关系处处长毕西金在致答词中，卑躬屈膝地表示“完全赞同罗斯托先生的观点”，他并公然宣称，纽约—莫斯科的通航使苏美“在发展更大的互相接触中开辟了一条重要的渠道”。
    十六日，当美国客机到达莫斯科机场时，苏修也举行了庆祝仪式。苏修民航部部长布加耶夫在欢迎词中叫嚷说，这条航线的开辟把苏修和美帝“联结在一起”，这将“增进”苏美两国间的“友谊”和促进“互相了解”。
    随同美国客机到莫斯科的前美国驻苏联的两名大使波伦和科勒也讲了话。波伦强调说，“这是一个历史性的事件——航线的开辟将使我们的关系普遍改善”。
    最近一个时期，苏修集团为了适应美帝国主义的需要，空前加速了苏美勾结的步伐。在这期间苏美签订了“防止核扩散条约”，建立“核保护伞”，在谈判所谓限制核武器问题上达成初步协议，批准了搁置多年的苏美领事协定，补充修改了两国一年前签订的航空协定，并迅速地建立了莫斯科—纽约航线，在苏美直达航线第一次通航的同一天苏美又签订了内容极其广泛的一九六八年——一九六九年文化交流协定。
    所有这些事实表明，自从去年六月苏修和美帝头目在葛拉斯堡罗密谈以来，苏修同美帝之间的勾结不断加深。在这方面，苏修新领导比他们的前任赫鲁晓夫搞得更露骨了，更公开了，更频繁了，更急迫了，更无耻了，充分暴露了他们积极充当美帝头号帮凶和忠实奴仆的叛徒面目。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“死心塌地让美帝国主义牵着鼻子走的奴才，到头来只能为美帝国主义殉葬。”苏修叛徒们绝对逃脱不了这种可耻的下场。
