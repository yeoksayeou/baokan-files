Italian workers have launched a new wave of strikes against the brutal exploitation by the monopoly bourgeoisie. On July 11, 250,000 industrial and agricultural workers in the Rome region went on a general strike, demanding wage increases and full employment.

In recent years, under the intensified exploitation by the Italian monopoly bourgeoisie, the living conditions of the Italian working people have become increasingly difficult. Many workers are unemployed. In the Italian capital of Rome alone, there are 30,000 industrial workers unemployed. 17,000 agricultural workers have been forced to leave the countryside around Rome and wander in search of work. Even those with jobs suffer from the brutal exploitation and oppression by the capitalists. Workers are extremely resentful of this situation.

On July 11, 250,000 industrial and agricultural workers in the Rome region jointly held a 24-hour general strike to express their anger and protest against the Italian government and the monopoly bourgeoisie. In the morning of July 11, thousands of workers gathered at the "Republic Square," followed by a massive demonstration in the central area of Rome. They also held a mass meeting in front of the Colosseum, protesting against the capitalists' layoffs and demanding that the government take measures to ensure employment for workers.

In other regions of Italy, the tide of strikes is also rising. On July 11, workers in Ferrara and Ravenna in northern Italy, and on July 10, workers in Pistoia in central Italy, went on strike, demanding full employment and opposing the brutal exploitation by the capitalists. In recent days, many cities in Italy have seen strikes in mechanical manufacturing plants, chemical plants, textile mills, food factories, and other factories.

Italian newspaper typesetters announced a 24-hour strike on July 13 to protest the capitalists' refusal to accept the workers' reasonable demands. This strike will prevent the evening newspapers of July 13 and the newspapers of July 14 from being published.

In the port of Genoa, the crew of the Italian ocean liner "Raffaello" also went on strike, demanding improved working conditions and union rights. The striking sailors also held a demonstration in front of the offices of the government-operated "Italian" company.

In the southern Italian town of Bari, workers at the state-owned metallurgical factory, Fusina Meridionali, after occupying the factory for 45 days, forced the factory management to agree to raise workers' wages and recognize workers' union rights. They also forced the factory management to revoke the unreasonable decision to dismiss worker representatives.

    新华社十三日讯　罗马消息：意大利工人阶级掀起了反对垄断资产阶级残酷剥削的新的罢工怒潮。罗马地区的产业和农业工人二十五万人，十一日举行总罢工，要求提高工资和充分就业。
    近年来，在意大利垄断资产阶级的加紧压榨下，意大利劳动人民的生活日益困苦。大批工人找不到工作。仅在意大利首都罗马，就有三万产业工人失业。一万七千名农业工人被迫离开罗马附近的农村，到处流浪，找寻工作。有职业的工人，也遭受着资本家的残酷剥削和压迫。工人对这种处境极为愤懑。
    罗马地区二十五万产业和农业工人，十一日联合举行了二十四小时的总罢工，向意大利政府和垄断资产阶级表示愤怒的抗议。十一日上午，数千名工人在“共和国广场”集合，接着在罗马市中心区举行了声势浩大的示威游行。他们还在罗马大圆形演技场前举行群众大会，抗议资本家解雇工人，要求政府采取措施，保证工人就业。
    在意大利的其他地区，罢工斗争的浪潮也在高涨。十一日在意大利北部的费拉拉和拉万纳，十日在意大利中部的皮斯托亚，工人都举行了罢工，要求充分就业，反对资本家的残酷剥削。连日来，意大利许多城市的机械制造厂、化学工厂、纺织厂、食品厂和其他工厂都爆发了罢工。
    意大利各报纸的排字工人宣布在十三日再次举行二十四小时的罢工，抗议资本家拒绝接受工人的合理要求。这次罢工将使得十三日的晚报和十四日的报纸无法出版。
    在热那亚港，意大利远洋航轮“拉菲洛号”的船员也举行了罢工，要求改善工作条件和享受工会权利。罢工的海员还在政府经营的“意大利”公司的办公室前举行了示威。
    在意大利南部的巴林，国营五金机械制造厂——富西内·默里迪奥纳利厂的工人，在占领了这个工厂四十五天以后，迫使工厂当局答应提高工人工资和承认工人享受工会权利，同时还迫使工厂当局取消了解雇工人代表的无理决定。
