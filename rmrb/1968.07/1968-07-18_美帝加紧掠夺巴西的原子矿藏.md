The U.S. Empire is hurrying to plunder Brazil's atomic mineral deposits. According to Brazilian mining technical personnel who disclosed information to the Brazilian press, the United States has completely taken control of the mining of Brazil's atomic mineral deposits. These technical personnel pointed out that since 1925, that is, for the past forty years, U.S. imperialism has been exploring Brazil's underground resources and searching for atomic mineral deposits. Although Brazilians have also begun to explore, due to a lack of funds, the work has stalled. Meanwhile, U.S. imperialism has taken advantage of this situation to hasten its control and plunder of Brazil's atomic mineral deposits.

    美帝加紧掠夺巴西的原子矿藏
    据巴西矿业技术人员向巴西报界透露，美国已完全掌握了巴西原子矿藏的开采。这些技术人员指出，从一九二五年起，即从四十年前起，美帝国主义就在勘探巴西地下资源，寻找原子矿藏。巴西人虽然也在努力开始勘探，但由于缺乏资金，工作停顿。而美帝国主义则利用这种情况加紧控制和掠夺巴西的原子矿藏。
