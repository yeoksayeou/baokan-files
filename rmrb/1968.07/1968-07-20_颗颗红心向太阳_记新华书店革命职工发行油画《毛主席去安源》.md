	“Warmly Celebrate the Issuance of the Oil Painting ‘Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan’!”
	“Long Live the Victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!”
	“Long Live, Long Live, and Ten Thousand Times Long Live Our Reddest Red Sun, Chairman Mao!”

	On July 17th, the Beijing Transformer Factory, the Beijing First Rolling Mill, and a certain unit of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force stationed in Beijing were filled with the sound of drums and gongs, and a festive atmosphere. As soon as the news that the revolutionary workers of the New China Bookstore were coming to issue the oil painting “Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan” was announced, the revolutionary masses and soldiers of these units had been eagerly awaiting this happy moment. Now, their wishes had come true. On this day, the revolutionary workers of the New China Bookstore in Xicheng District, Beijing, came to issue the oil painting “Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan.” People gathered around the decorated vehicle carrying the oil paintings, cheering and jumping. Wherever the decorated vehicle went, the shouts of “Long Live Chairman Mao” echoed.

	When people finally obtained the long-awaited oil painting, many were moved to tears, and many gazed at Chairman Mao’s radiant image for a long time. They had so much to say to Chairman Mao!

	Old worker Wang Xinghua said, “Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! This oil painting depicts your great care and high expectations for the working class, and it also depicts our working class’s boundless loyalty and admiration for you.”

	Five Good Soldier Wang Jinliang said, “Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! This oil painting exposes the lies of the Chinese Khrushchev who distorted the history of the Anshan workers’ revolutionary movement, and it further increases our hatred for this great traitor and great saboteur.”

	Li Yonggui, an active learner of Chairman Mao’s works, said, “Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It is you who have shown us the direction forward, and it is you who have given us the boundless strength to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.”

	Word by word, sentence by sentence, every word and sentence was filled with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, and every word and sentence was filled with deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev. On this joyous day of issuing the oil painting “Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan,” the revolutionary workers of the New China Bookstore in Xicheng District, Beijing, heard so many such touching voices!

	Since the issuance of the oil painting “Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan” began, the revolutionary workers of this bookstore have been immersed in immense happiness. They constantly received calls from the revolutionary masses expressing their desire to obtain this oil painting, and every time they issued the oil painting, they heard the shouts of “Long Live Chairman Mao” echoing in their ears. The boundless loyalty of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to the great leader Chairman Mao inspired them, and they were more determined in their revolutionary resolve: they must, with the highest political enthusiasm, the greatest revolutionary spirit, the best service quality, and the fastest issuance speed, deliver the oil painting “Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan” to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Today, under the inspiration of this battle slogan, they decorated the vehicle, beat drums and gongs, and delivered the oil painting “Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan” to the factories and the People’s Liberation Army’s garrison.

	At the Beijing Transformer Factory, the scene of workers enthusiastically praising the great leader Chairman Mao and angrily criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev made the bookstore distribution soldiers unable to calm down for a long time. Many workers, holding the oil painting they had longed for day and night, gazed at Chairman Mao’s radiant image for a long time, and could not help but compete to praise the great achievements of the great leader Chairman Mao. They said: Without Chairman Mao, there would be no New China, and without Chairman Mao, there would be no today for the working class. Chairman Mao is the great savior of the working class and tens of millions of laboring people! The great traitor and great saboteur, Chinese Khrushchev, shamelessly distorted the history of the Anshan workers’ revolutionary movement. We will never agree to this! We will never agree to this! We must, with Mao Zedong Thought as our invincible weapon, carry out an in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly overthrow and expose Chinese Khrushchev, this old counter-revolutionary.

	At the garrison of a certain unit of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force stationed in Beijing, the broad masses of soldiers and officers’ deep proletarian feelings of boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, boundless loyalty to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line deeply educated the revolutionary workers of the New China Bookstore. As early as when the oil painting “Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan” was sent with the newspapers by the People’s Daily and the Liberation Army Daily, many pilots had already pasted this oil painting in their cockpits. Li Shengfu, an active learner of Chairman Mao’s works and the deputy leader of a squadron of female navigators, said excitedly: “The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Forty-seven years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao personally went to Anshan to open up the glorious path of the proletarian revolutionary movement for us. Today, Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the first proletarian cultural revolution in human history, opening up a victorious path for us to continue the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Great Mao Zedong Thought guides us in our battles. No matter what storms, difficulties, and obstacles we encounter, we will unswervingly advance along the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao!” In recent days, the broad masses of soldiers and officers of this unit have drawn immense spiritual strength from the oil painting “Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan.” They longed to obtain more oil paintings. Just at this moment, the revolutionary comrades from the New China Bookstore delivered the oil painting “Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan” to their hands. They shouted joyously thousands of times: Long Live Chairman Mao! Ten Thousand Times Long Live!

	When the revolutionary workers of the New China Bookstore arrived at the Beijing First Rolling Mill with the oil painting “Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan,” the shouts of “Long Live Chairman Mao” once again resonated strongly with the bookstore workers. The revolutionary workers of this factory had just come out of a revolutionary criticism meeting when they received the radiant oil painting “Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan,” and their emotions were particularly stirred. On August 10, 1966, some revolutionary workers of this factory, together with the revolutionary masses of the capital, happily received the reception of our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao. The great call issued by Chairman Mao at this reception, “You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end,” has been inspiring the revolutionary workers of this factory. Over the past two years, they, together with hundreds of millions of revolutionary people across the country, have exposed one after another the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line has become more deeply rooted in people’s hearts, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been victorious step by step, and the revolutionary and production situation of the Beijing First Rolling Mill has been excellent and getting better. They warmly celebrated the birth of the oil painting “Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan” as a glorious achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great victory of Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line. The workers one by one gazed deeply at Chairman Mao’s radiant image in the oil painting and solemnly pledged to the great leader Chairman Mao: We must always remember your great teachings, always pay attention to state affairs, closely follow your great strategic deployments, carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, and launch fierce attacks on a handful of class enemies without stopping, and we will surely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    颗颗红心向太阳
    ——记新华书店革命职工发行油画《毛主席去安源》
      “热烈欢呼油画《毛主席去安源》的发行！”
    “无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！”
      “我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    七月十七日，北京变压器厂、北京第一轧钢厂和中国人民解放军空军驻京部队某部驻地，锣鼓喧天，一片欢腾。早在新华书店的革命职工要前来发行油画《毛主席去安源》的喜讯传来的时候，这几个单位的革命群众和解放军指战员，就在盼望着这个幸福时刻的到来。现在，他们的愿望实现了。这一天，北京西城区新华书店的革命职工前来发行《毛主席去安源》的油画，人们围拢着运送油画的彩车，欢呼，跳跃，彩车开到哪里，哪里就响起了“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声。当人们得到了渴望已久的这幅油画的时候，多少人激动得热泪盈眶，多少人久久地凝望着毛主席的光辉形象，他们有多少贴心的话儿要对毛主席讲！
    老工人王兴华说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！这幅油画画出了您老人家对我们工人阶级的巨大关怀和殷切期望，画出了我们工人阶级对您老人家的无限忠诚和无限敬仰。”
    五好战士王金良说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！这幅油画剥下了中国赫鲁晓夫颠倒安源工人革命运动历史的画皮，更增加了我们工农兵对中国赫鲁晓夫这个大叛徒、大工贼的刻骨仇恨。”
    学习毛主席著作积极分子李永贵说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！是您给我们指明了前进的方向，是您给了我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的无穷力量。”
    一字字，一句句，字字句句饱含了对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，字字句句充满了对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨。北京西城区新华书店的革命职工，在发行油画《毛主席去安源》的喜日里，听到了多少这样感人的心声！
    《毛主席去安源》油画的发行工作开始以来，这个书店的革命职工一直沉浸在无比幸福之中。他们不断接到革命群众表达渴望得到这幅油画的电话，他们在每次发行这幅油画的时候，耳边总是不断回响着“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声。广大工农兵群众无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的火热感情，激励着他们，更加坚定了他们的革命决心：一定要以最高的政治热情，最大的革命干劲，最好的服务质量，最快的发行速度，把油画《毛主席去安源》送到广大工农兵手中。今天，他们又在这一战斗口号鼓舞下，扎起彩车，敲锣打鼓，把《毛主席去安源》的油画送到了工厂和人民解放军驻地。
    在北京变压器厂，工人们热情歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，愤怒批判中国赫鲁晓夫的场景，使喜送油画的图书发行战士久久不能平静。许多工人手捧日夜盼望的油画，长久地瞻仰毛主席的光辉形象，情不自禁地争相歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的丰功伟绩。他们说：没有毛主席就没有新中国，没有毛主席就没有咱工人阶级的今天。毛主席是我们工人阶级和千千万万劳动人民的大救星！中国赫鲁晓夫这个大叛徒、大工贼，无耻地篡改安源工人革命运动的历史，我们一千个不答应！一万个不答应！我们一定要以毛泽东思想这一无比锐利的武器，更深入持久地开展革命大批判，彻底斗倒斗臭中国赫鲁晓夫这个老反革命。
    在中国人民解放军空军驻京部队某部驻地，广大指战员无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，无限忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的深厚的无产阶级感情，使新华书店的革命职工受到了深刻的教育。早在《人民日报》、《解放军报》随报纸赠送《毛主席去安源》油画的时候，许多飞行员就把这幅油画贴进了机舱。学习毛主席著作积极分子、大队女领航副主任王善富激动地说：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。四十七年前，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自去安源给我们开拓无产阶级革命运动的光辉道路，今天，毛主席又亲自发动和领导了人类历史上第一次无产阶级文化大革命，给我们开辟了在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的胜利航道。伟大的毛泽东思想指挥着我们进行战斗，不论遇到什么狂风暴雨，艰难险阻，我们都要坚定不移地沿着毛主席指引的革命航道奋勇前进！”连日来，这个部队的广大指战员从《毛主席去安源》油画中汲取了巨大的精神力量，他们盼望能够得到更多的油画。正是这个时候，新华书店的革命战友把油画《毛主席去安源》送到了他们手中。他们千遍万遍地纵情欢呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    新华书店革命职工带着《毛主席去安源》油画来到北京第一轧钢厂的时候，“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声又一次激起了书店职工的强烈共鸣。这个厂的革命职工刚从革命大批判的会场出来，就得到了光辉的《毛主席去安源》油画，心情特别激动。一九六六年八月十日，这个工厂的一些革命职工同首都广大革命群众一道，幸福地受到了我们伟大统帅毛主席的接见。毛主席在这次接见中发出的“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大号召，一直鼓舞着这个厂的革命职工。两年来，他们和全国亿万革命群众一起，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人一个个地揪了出来，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加深入人心，无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利，北京第一轧钢厂的革命和生产形势一片大好，越来越好。他们热烈欢呼油画《毛主席去安源》的诞生是无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌成果，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。工人们一个个深情地凝视着油画上毛主席的光辉形象，向伟大领袖毛主席庄严宣誓：我们一定要牢记您的伟大教导，时时刻刻关心国家大事，紧跟您的伟大战略部署，深入持久地开展革命大批判，主动地不停顿地向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
