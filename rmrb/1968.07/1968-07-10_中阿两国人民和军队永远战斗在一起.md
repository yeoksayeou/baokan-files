The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who are in the process of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are filled with deep proletarian internationalist feelings and warmly celebrate the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Albanian People's Army, our close comrades-in-arms.

The Albanian People's Army is a glorious, battle-tested army built and nurtured by the glorious Albanian Labor Party and the great Marxist-Leninist Enver Hoxha. Over the past 25 years, this heroic army has traveled a glorious path of struggle and has made immortal contributions to the country and the people.

The Albanian People's Army and the Albanian people, closely united, defeated the Italian and German fascist occupiers through revolutionary war, liberated their own country, and made important contributions to the world's anti-fascist war.

The Albanian People's Army and the Albanian people, together, stand firmly on the front line of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, holding high the revolutionary red flag of Marxism-Leninism, and displaying the fearless spirit of the proletarian revolution. They have smashed the subversive and destructive activities of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, the Tito clique and the Soviet modern revisionist clique, defended the socialist revolution and socialist construction of their country, and continuously consolidated and strengthened the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The Albanian People's Army adheres to the proletarian line of building the army and continuously strengthens its revolutionary construction. In recent years, in the great mass movement of revolutionary transformation that has been vigorously carried out by the Albanian people, the Albanian People's Army has resolutely carried out many important directives of the Albanian Labor Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha, restored the party committee system, re-established political commissars, abolished military ranks, strengthened political and ideological work, launched the "model company" movement, and strengthened the militia work, among other revolutionary measures. These steps have further strengthened the leadership of the party, highlighted proletarian politics, improved relations between officers and soldiers and between the army and the people, maintained and carried forward the glorious traditions of the people's army, and achieved great success.

This beacon of great socialism in Europe shines even more brilliantly, which is a great encouragement to the Chinese people who are successfully carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army warmly congratulate the brilliant victories achieved by the Albanian people and the people's army! We are immensely proud to have such heroic revolutionary people and revolutionary army as our close comrades-in-arms! We will definitely follow the great teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao on "learning from the people of the world" and learn well from the heroic Albanian people and the people's army.

The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, pointed out: "We are now in a new and great era of world revolution.... The day of the burial of U.S. imperialism and all other harmful creatures will not be far off."

The great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, also pointed out: "Human history has entered an era where socialist revolution triumphs worldwide and the bloody oppression and slavery of capitalism collapse."

At present, the anti-imperialist revolutionary situation of the people of the world is excellent. While the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are vigorously developing their anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles, a great storm of revolutionary mass movements has risen in Europe, North America, and Oceania. The days of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are getting worse. They are tightening their counter-revolutionary global collusion and frantically carrying out their sinister activities of anti-China, anti-Albania, anti-communism, anti-people, and anti-revolution. The signing of the "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism is another serious step in their formation of a counter-revolutionary nuclear military alliance, and it is also another exposure of the traitorous face of Soviet revisionism in its intensified pursuit of the line of betrayal and capitulation, acting as the number one henchman of U.S. imperialism. However, no matter how U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism join forces, they cannot stop the surging revolutionary tide, nor can they save their inevitable doom.

"Though China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are united." The great friendship between the peoples of China and Albania, personally forged by our great leader Chairman Mao and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, has been tested by the storms and tempests of international class struggle and is the greatest and most precious friendship in the world. The Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, will definitely follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, stand closely with the Albanian people and the people's army, stand closely with all Marxist-Leninists in the world, and stand closely with all revolutionary people in the world. Together, we will fight shoulder to shoulder and march forward to overthrow imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, and build a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without systems of exploitation!

    中阿两国人民和军队永远战斗在一起
    今天，正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的中国人民和中国人民解放军，满怀无产阶级国际主义的深厚感情，热烈庆祝我们亲密的战友阿尔巴尼亚人民军建军二十五周年。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军，是光荣的、久经考验的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志创建和培育的英雄的人民军队。二十五年来，这支英雄军队，经历了光荣的战斗道路，为祖国、为人民建立了不朽的功绩。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军和阿尔巴尼亚人民紧紧地团结在一起，用革命战争打败了意大利和德国法西斯占领者，解放了自己的祖国，在世界人民反法西斯战争中作出了重要贡献。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军和阿尔巴尼亚人民一道，坚定地站在反帝、反修的最前线，高举马克思列宁主义的革命红旗，发扬大无畏的无产阶级革命精神，粉碎了美帝国主义及其走狗、铁托叛徒集团和苏联现代修正主义叛徒集团的颠覆破坏活动，保卫了祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，不断巩固和加强了无产阶级专政。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军，坚持无产阶级建军路线，不断加强自己的革命化建设。近几年来，在阿尔巴尼亚人民蓬勃开展的革命化的伟大群众运动中，阿尔巴尼亚人民军坚决贯彻执行阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和恩维尔·霍查同志的许多重要指示，实行恢复党委制度，重新设立政治委员，取消军衔，大力加强政治思想工作，开展“模范连队”运动，大力加强民兵工作等一系列革命化措施，进一步加强了党的领导，突出了无产阶级政治，密切了官兵关系和军民关系，保持和发扬了人民军队的光荣传统，取得了很大的成绩。
    阿尔巴尼亚这盏欧洲伟大的社会主义明灯，放射出更加灿烂的光辉，这对于正在胜利进行无产阶级文化大革命的中国人民，是一个巨大的鼓舞。中国人民和人民解放军热烈祝贺阿尔巴尼亚人民和人民军所取得的辉煌胜利！我们为有这样英雄的革命人民和革命军队作为自己的亲密战友感到无比自豪！我们一定遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“要善于向世界各国人民学习”的伟大教导，很好地向英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民和人民军学习。
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。……美帝国主义和其他一切害人虫已经准备好了自己的掘墓人，他们被埋葬的日子不会太长了。”
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志也指出：“人类历史已经进入了社会主义革命在世界范围内胜利、资本主义的血腥压迫的奴役制度崩溃的时代。”
    当前，全世界人民的反帝革命形势一片大好。在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民反帝反殖斗争蓬勃发展的同时，欧洲、北美、大洋洲，兴起了革命群众运动的伟大风暴，美帝苏修的日子越来越不好过。它们正在加紧反革命全球勾结，猖狂进行反华、反阿、反共、反人民、反革命的罪恶活动。美帝苏修合伙炮制和签署“防止核扩散条约”，就是它们加紧结成反革命核军事同盟的又一个严重步骤，也是苏修变本加厉地推行叛卖投降路线、充当美帝头号帮凶的叛徒嘴脸的又一次大暴露。但是，不管美帝苏修怎样狼狈为奸，都阻挡不了滚滚向前的革命洪流，挽救不了它们必然灭亡的命运。
    “中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。”我们的伟大领袖毛主席和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志亲手缔造的中阿两国人民的友谊，是经过国际阶级斗争的急风暴雨考验的，是世界上最伟大、最珍贵的友谊。经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼、无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的中国人民和人民解放军，一定遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，同阿尔巴尼亚人民和人民军紧密地站在一起，同全世界马克思列宁主义者紧密地站在一起，同全世界革命人民紧密地站在一起，为打倒帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，建立一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界，并肩战斗，共同前进！
