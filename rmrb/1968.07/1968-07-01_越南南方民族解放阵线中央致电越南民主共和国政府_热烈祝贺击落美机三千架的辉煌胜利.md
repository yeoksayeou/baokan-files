The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the Command of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam sent a cable on June 28 to the Government of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic and the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army to enthusiastically congratulate the brilliant victory of the military and people of North Vietnam in shooting down 3,000 U.S. aggressor aircraft.

The cable said: In the extremely fierce battles on the front lines against the U.S. and its puppet clique, the military and people of the South are constantly looking towards their beloved North with unshakable confidence in victory. The more the enemy's hatred for the South deepens, the more the military and people of the South are inspired by the brilliant achievements of the North.

The cable said, the brilliant achievement of the North in shooting down 3,000 aircraft and the unprecedented great and comprehensive victories achieved by the South since the New Year further prove that the fraternal unity between the rear and the front is the invincible force of the entire Vietnamese nation in decisively defeating the U.S. aggressors.

The cable said: At present, the U.S. aggressors and their puppets are in their death throes, frantically intensifying their war of aggression in the South and more obstinately continuing their mad bombing and strafing of the densely populated areas of the North. The military and people of the South are determined to join hands with the military and people of the North, to learn from the North, to compete with the North, to fully display the heroic spirit of the Vietnamese revolution, to resolutely overcome all difficulties and obstacles, to fear no sacrifices, and to advance in victory.

The cable concluded: The South will surely win!

The North will surely win!

Our motherland Vietnam will surely achieve independence, reunification, peace, democracy, and prosperity!
