Tanzanian Minister of State Mgonja pointed out that the "Non-Proliferation Treaty" is completely a fraud and an insult to non-nuclear countries. He also condemned U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and expressed resolute support for the Vietnamese people and the national liberation struggles in Africa.

According to a report by the _Nationalist_ on July 5, Mgonja said in the parliament on July 4 that the "Non-Proliferation Treaty" is hypocritical and completely a fraud. The treaty contains no clauses requiring the destruction of nuclear weapons already stockpiled by nuclear powers. Instead, it mistakenly assumes that the danger of nuclear war lies in the possibility of non-nuclear countries acquiring nuclear weapons. This treaty is highly unjust and an insult to non-nuclear countries.

Mgonja, when discussing the liberation struggles of the African people, said that the liberation wars against imperialism and white fascism in Africa have reached a critical stage. Tanzania will continue to support these liberation wars until final victory. He said, "In the liberation wars in Africa, Tanzania will not hesitate due to any obstacles until it is certain that the oppression of imperialism and white fascism against the African people is completely eliminated."

He pointed out that the enemies of Africa, with the help and instigation of certain Western countries that pretend to be friendly to Africa, have formed the so-called "Holy Alliance of Africa." The fascists of South Africa are colluding with Portuguese colonialists and the racist regime of Southern Rhodesia to oppress the African people. He said, "It is precisely because they have received aid from certain Western countries that these small number of white regimes dare to continue oppressing the African people."

Mgonja called for African independent states to strengthen cooperation in order to provide more assistance to the freedom fighters in Africa who are suffering under the fascist oppression of figures like (South Africa's) Vorster, (Southern Rhodesia's) Smith, and (Portugal's) Salazar. He said, "Tanzania is determined to make every effort to fulfill its obligations to our continent, resolutely opposing imperialism, racism, and neo-colonialism."

When discussing the situation in Vietnam, Mgonja pointed out that U.S. imperialism has no justification for fabricating excuses to attack the Vietnamese people, thereby interfering in their internal affairs. The Vietnamese people are fighting against imperialist aggression. Tanzania will fearlessly and unhesitatingly support the struggle of the Vietnamese people. Mgonja also pointed out that the puppet regime in South Vietnam is a tool of imperialists and colonialists.

When discussing the current situation in the Middle East, Mgonja said, "We fully support the Arab people. The Israeli army must withdraw from the Arab territories it has occupied."

In his speech, Mgonja reaffirmed that Tanzania adheres to a non-aligned policy.

Mgonja said that President Nyerere's visits to the People's Republic of China and other Asian and African countries are aimed at strengthening African unity and the solidarity of the African people with the people of Asia and the world.

    坦桑尼亚国务部长姆贡贾指出
    “防止核扩散条约”完全是骗人的东西
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆五日电　坦桑尼亚主管外事的国务部长姆贡贾四日在坦桑尼亚国民议会发表外交政策讲话时指出，“防止核扩散条约”完全是骗人的东西，是对无核国家的侮辱。他还谴责美帝国主义侵略越南，表示坚决支持越南人民和非洲的民族解放战争。
    据《民族主义者报》五日报道，姆贡贾四日在议会说，“防止核扩散条约”是虚伪的，完全是骗人的东西。这个条约中没有任何条款规定要销除核国家已经储存的核武器。它却错误地认为核战争的危险在于无核国家获得核武器的可能性。这个条约是十分不公正的。它是对无核国家的侮辱。
    姆贡贾在谈到非洲人民解放斗争时说，非洲反对帝国主义和白人法西斯主义的解放战争已经发展到一个紧要阶段，坦桑尼亚将继续支持解放战争，直至最后胜利。他说：“在非洲的解放战争中，坦桑尼亚不会由于任何障碍而踌躇不前，直到它确信帝国主义和白人法西斯主义对非洲人的压迫完全消除为止。”
    他指出，非洲的敌人在伪装同非洲友好的西方国家的帮助和唆使下已经组成非洲神圣同盟。南非的法西斯主义者正同葡萄牙殖民主义者和南罗得西亚的种族主义者勾结起来，压迫非洲人民。他说：“正是由于得到了某些西方国家的援助，这些人数甚少的白人政权才敢于继续压迫非洲人民。”
    姆贡贾呼吁非洲独立国家加强合作，以便向受到（南非）沃斯特、（南罗）史密斯和（葡萄牙）萨拉查等暴君的法西斯主义压迫的非洲自由战士提供更多的援助。他说：“坦桑尼亚决心进一步作出一切努力来履行对我们大陆的义务，坚决反对帝国主义、种族主义和新殖民主义。”
    在谈到越南问题时，姆贡贾指出美帝国主义没有任何理由制造借口向越南人民发动进攻，从而干涉他们的内政。越南人民正在进行抗击帝国主义侵略的斗争。坦桑尼亚将毫不畏惧、毫不犹豫地坚决支持越南人民的斗争。姆贡贾还指出，南越傀儡政权是帝国主义者和殖民主义者的工具。
    姆贡贾在谈到当前的中东局势时说，我们完全支持阿拉伯人。以色列军队必须撤出它所占领的阿拉伯领土。
    姆贡贾在讲话中重申，坦桑尼亚奉行不结盟政策。
    姆贡贾说，尼雷尔总统对中华人民共和国和其它亚非国家的访问，是为了加强非洲的团结，加强非洲人民与亚洲以及全世界人民的团结。
