On the occasion of the 47th anniversary of the founding of the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party, the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin has issued a new battle order to us, deciding that our workers', peasants', and soldiers' ballet troupe and several other revolutionary model troupes will once again perform revolutionary model operas personally cultivated by Comrade Jiang Qing. This is the greatest trust, encouragement, and spur for us revolutionary cultural workers. Upon hearing the news, all revolutionary comrades in our workers', peasants', and soldiers' ballet troupe were filled with excitement and high political enthusiasm, actively throwing themselves into the battle. Everyone expressed their determination to combine this performance with the great criticism and revolutionize people's thinking through performance practice; to turn the stage into a battlefield, making every performance a new offensive against China's Khrushchev and a small handful of class enemies at home and abroad, giving those who attempt to use literature to subvert the dictatorship of the proletariat and madly attack our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution a resounding blow!

Four years ago, under the diligent cultivation of Comrade Jiang Qing, the world's first revolutionary ballet that sings the praises of workers', peasants', and soldiers' heroes, "The Red Detachment of Women," was born. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a bountiful fruit of proletarian revolutionary new literature. It was like a spring thunder that shook all of China and startled the world. With the force of a thunderbolt, it swept away the evil winds and fog on the ballet stage, driving away all the emperors, generals, young masters, and young ladies. With its revolutionary political content and perfect artistic form, it wrote a brilliant new chapter in the history of world ballet.

Over the past four years, the performance of "The Red Detachment of Women" has been enthusiastically welcomed by revolutionary people both at home and abroad. A worker comrade reflected, "Workers, peasants, and soldiers becoming the masters of ballet is something that has never happened in the world. Our great leader Chairman Mao not only made us stand up in politics and economics but also made us stand up in culture. We will forever shout: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" A Japanese friend, after watching our performance, said, "Your creation and performance of 'The Red Detachment of Women' are in line with the spirit of Chairman Mao's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art.' Chinese ballet has a high degree of thoughtfulness." In short, "The Red Detachment of Women" and the other seven model operas have shown the Chinese and world revolutionary people the unparalleled correctness and great power of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line. However, what the broad revolutionary masses support is precisely what the class enemies oppose. "The Red Detachment of Women" is a powerful weapon of revolution for the people, but for China's Khrushchev and his agents, it is a noose around their necks. They hate it to death and fear it to death. Therefore, from the beginning of the creation of "The Red Detachment of Women" to the present, it has always been surrounded by the struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads.

As early as the initial creation period led by Comrade Jiang Qing, China's Khrushchev and his agents Zhou Yang, Lin Moquan, and others tried every means to sabotage it. After its successful creation, they attempted to strangle this new thing in its cradle, saying that "The Red Detachment of Women" is a "ugly daughter-in-law who can't see her parents-in-law" and a "half-cooked steamed bun," and so on. History is the most ruthless. The class enemies' curses and opposition not only did not curse down "The Red Detachment of Women" but, on the contrary, "The Red Detachment of Women" performed better and better and became more and more popular. However, class enemies are not willing to die. They still struggle desperately. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the struggle between the two lines around "The Red Detachment of Women" continues. A small handful of people with ulterior motives, like all class enemies at home and abroad, madly attack the model operas cultivated by Comrade Jiang Qing, slandering "The Red Detachment of Women" as formulaic, conceptual, and "plain boiled water." This is intolerable! Under the guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing and with the specific help of the PLA comrades, we have gone through the serious struggle of purging the class ranks, exposing a small handful of class enemies. In this living class struggle classroom, broad revolutionary comrades have been tempered, and their class struggle awareness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines have been raised. A revolutionary class force has gradually formed in the struggle. The "Summary of the Symposium on the Army's Literary and Art Work Convened by Comrade Lin Biao and Assigned by Comrade Jiang Qing" instructs us: "After eliminating this black line, there will still be future black lines, and we will have to continue the struggle. Therefore, this is a long, arduous, and complex struggle that will require decades, even hundreds of years of effort." We must never relax our class vigilance. We deeply understand that what Comrade Jiang Qing led us to create is not just "The Red Detachment of Women," but she has shown us the bright path of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line. All class enemies denigrate and negate it precisely because of the immense power of the model operas. We will defend it as we would defend our eyes. Whoever dares to oppose the model operas, we will fight to the end! We will strive for the rest of our lives to implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line!

    向反革命文艺黑线发起新进攻
    工农兵芭蕾舞剧团无产阶级革命派
    在伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党诞生四十七周年的大喜日子里，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部向我们发出新的战斗的号令，决定我们工农兵芭蕾舞剧团和其他几个革命文艺样板团，再次公演由江青同志亲手培育的革命样板戏。这是对我们革命文艺工作者最大的信任、最大的鼓舞和最大的鞭策。我们工农兵芭蕾舞剧团的全体革命同志闻风而动，都以极其兴奋的心情和饱满的政治热情积极地投入了战斗。大家纷纷表示决心，要把这次演出和革命的大批判结合起来，要把演出实践和人的思想革命化结合起来；要把舞台作战场，使每场演出都变成向中国赫鲁晓夫和国内外一小撮阶级敌人的新进攻，给那些妄图利用文艺作舆论来颠覆无产阶级专政和疯狂地攻击我国无产阶级文化大革命的敌人以迎头的痛击！
    四年前，在敬爱的江青同志辛勤培育下，世界上第一个歌颂工农兵英雄的革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》诞生了，这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级革命新文艺的丰硕成果。它犹如一声春雷轰动了全中国，震惊了全世界。它以雷霆万钧之势，横扫了芭蕾舞台上的妖风迷雾，把帝王将相、少爷小姐之流统统赶下了舞台。它以革命的政治内容和完美的艺术形式，谱写了世界芭蕾舞史上光辉灿烂的新篇章。
    四年来，《红色娘子军》的演出，受到了中外革命人民热烈的欢迎。有一位工人同志反映说：“工农兵成为芭蕾舞剧的主人，这是世界上从来没有过的事。我们伟大的领袖毛主席不仅使我们在政治上和经济上翻了身，而且也使我们在文化上翻了身。我们要永远高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”一位日本朋友看了我们的演出后说：“你们创作和演出的《红色娘子军》符合毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的精神。中国的芭蕾舞是有高度思想性的。”总之，《红色娘子军》和其他七个样板戏向全中国、全世界革命人民展示了毛主席革命文艺路线的无比正确和巨大的威力。但是，广大革命人民所拥护的，也正是阶级敌人所反对的。《红色娘子军》对于人民大众来说，是革命的有力武器，而对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人来说，就是套在他们脖子上的绞索，他们恨得要死，怕得要命。因此，从开始创作《红色娘子军》起，一直到现在，始终都围绕着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。
    早在江青同志领导创作初期，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人周扬、林默涵之流就千方百计地进行破坏活动。创作成功之后，他们又妄图把这个新生事物扼杀在摇篮里，胡说什么《红色娘子军》是“见不得公婆的丑媳妇”，是“半生不熟的窝窝头”等等。历史是最无情的。阶级敌人的谩骂和反对，不但没有把《红色娘子军》骂倒，相反，《红色娘子军》越演越好，越来越红。但是阶级敌人是不甘心死亡的，他们还要作垂死的挣扎。在无产阶级文化大革命中，围绕着《红色娘子军》的两条路线斗争仍在继续。一小撮别有用心的人，他们和国内外一切阶级敌人一样，疯狂地攻击江青同志所培育的革命样板戏，诬蔑《红色娘子军》是公式化、概念化，是“白开水”。是可忍，孰不可忍！我们在江青同志指示下，在解放军同志的具体帮助下，经过了清理阶级队伍的严肃斗争，揪出了一小撮阶级敌人。广大革命同志在这活生生的阶级斗争的大课堂里受到了锻炼，阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争的觉悟都有了提高，一支革命化的阶级队伍在斗争中逐步形成。《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》中指示我们：“搞掉这条黑线之后，还会有将来的黑线，还得再斗争。所以，这是一场艰巨、复杂、长期的斗争，要经过几十年甚至几百年的努力。”我们一刻也不能放松阶级警惕。我们深深懂得，江青同志领导我们创作出来的不只是一个《红色娘子军》，而是给我们指明了毛主席革命文艺路线的光明大道。一切阶级敌人之所以诋毁它、否定它，正证明了革命样板戏的无比巨大的威力。我们要象保护眼睛一样地捍卫它，谁胆敢反对革命样板戏，我们就一定和他拚到底！我们坚决为贯彻毛主席的革命文艺路线奋斗终生！
