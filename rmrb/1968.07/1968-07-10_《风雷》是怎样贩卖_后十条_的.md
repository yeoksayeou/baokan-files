At the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "never forget class struggle" and proposed the great task of conducting socialist education, sounding the bugle for the proletariat's counterattack against the bourgeoisie. Seeing the situation was unfavorable, the Chinese Khrushchev immediately adopted the counterrevolutionary two-faced tactics of the bourgeoisie, taking over the slogan of the socialist education movement, distorting and altering it, and concocting the extremely reactionary "Later Ten Points." He threw out a line of "left" in form but right in essence, a bourgeois reactionary line, attempting to lead the movement astray.

The reactionary novel "Storm and Thunder" not only enthusiastically cheered for the revisionist wind and the wind of individual farming stirred up by the Chinese Khrushchev; it also exerted all its strength to shout slogans and cheer for the reactionary line of "left" in form but right in essence. The counterrevolutionary element Chen Dengke confessed: "Storm and Thunder" was revised based on the "Later Ten Points."

The socialist education movement began in 1963. However, "Storm and Thunder" had its protagonist, Zhu Yongkang, launch a "socialist education movement" as early as 1954. The methods of this "movement" were completely the same as those used by the Chinese Khrushchev in his fake Four Cleanups and true restoration.

According to Chairman Mao's teachings, the socialist education movement must "grasp the key of class struggle, grasp the key of the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism," to resolve the "contradiction between socialism and capitalism." The Chinese Khrushchev, however, absurdly claimed that the nature of the movement was "the intertwining of contradictions within and outside the party, or the intertwining of enemy and people's internal contradictions," attempting to use these two "intertwined" contradictions to obliterate the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, in order to achieve his evil goal of fake Four Cleanups and true restoration.

The counterrevolutionary element Chen Dengke followed in the footsteps of the Chinese Khrushchev, and in "Storm and Thunder," he racked his brains to fabricate Huangni Township as a typical example of "internal and external contradictions intertwined." To illustrate this "intertwining," Chen Dengke concocted a string of absurd and vulgar relationships among characters. In Chen Dengke's portrayal, party cadres, "heroic" figures, reactionary rich peasants, and poor and lower-middle peasants were all connected by a bond of kinship: the reactionary rich peasant Huang Longfei was the father-in-law of the district party secretary Xiong Bin; Xiong Bin was the brother-in-law of the county party secretary Fang Xudong; Fang Xudong was the comrade-in-arms of the "heroic" figure Zhu Yongkang; the "good cadre" Ren Weiqun's sister-in-law, the "poor peasant" Yang Xiuying, was Huang Longfei's concubine. Among these characters, Chen Dengke depicted various kinds of contradictions and struggles, such as class enemies colluding with "poor and lower-middle peasants"; party and non-party bad elements conspiring together to frame cadres; the struggle between Zhu Yongkang and Zhu Xikun centered on personal grudges. It was truly a web of contradictions, complex and tangled. However, in these "contradictions" and "struggles," the essence of the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism was nowhere to be seen.

According to Chairman Mao's teachings, the socialist education movement is to mobilize the masses, focus on rectifying those within the party who are taking the capitalist road, further strengthen proletarian dictatorship, and prevent the restoration of capitalism. What did the so-called socialist education movement in the reactionary novel "Storm and Thunder" focus on rectifying? It was the masses. In Chen Dengke's portrayal, the masses of Huangni Township were full of bad people and bad deeds. The deeply aggrieved Yang Xiuying was a "loose woman," and the beggar Huang Dashi was a lazybones. They speculated, committed crimes, and did evil. It seemed that the problems of Huangni Township were all on them. Thus, they became the main targets of rectification. Look, the descriptions in the novel are exactly the same as the Chinese Khrushchev's use of the slogan "solve whatever problems there are" to create various pretexts, to persecute cadres and masses, and to push forward the bourgeois reactionary line of "left" in form but right in essence!

The methods used in the "socialist education movement" in "Storm and Thunder" were completely the same as the Chinese Khrushchev's "secret investigations" and "rooting and linking up." The Chinese Khrushchev fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's long-standing advocacy and practice of the mass line, opposed using class analysis to conduct social investigations, and absurdly claimed that "poor and lower-middle peasants do not tell us the truth," "investigations cannot uncover problems." He treated a socialist new countryside liberated for more than a decade as an "enemy-occupied area" and absurdly brought out a set of so-called "White Area work experience," advocating "secret work" and "rooting and linking up" after the work team entered the village.

The reactionary novel "Storm and Thunder" used a large amount of text to describe Zhu Yongkang's mysterious activities of hiding his identity, such as "night visit to He Laojiu," "chance encounter with Yang Xiuying," and "three invitations to Lu Suchun." Zhu Yongkang's methods are not unfamiliar to us; they are the same as the bourgeois element Wang ×× who "wore a large mask and a large headscarf" and secretly carried out activities in Taoyuan! Chen Dengke highly praised this "secret investigation" and exaggerated its political "power," vigorously advocating that it was through this method that the "wrong case" of Ren Weiqun was rectified, and the cover of "class struggle" in Huangni Township was lifted. It was absurd to the extreme!

Look at the "roots" Zhu Yongkang planted and the objects he relied on: there was Ren Weiqun, who rectified the case without going through the masses; there was the "old poor peasant" Li Xuecheng, who shouted that he had not "turned over" since liberation. Zhu Yongkang used these people to stir up a wind of rectifying wrong cases and a wind of individual farming in Huangni Township, and to carry out activities of restoring capitalism.

The reactionary novel "Storm and Thunder" vigorously advocated and beautified the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line of "left" in form but right in essence, in order to cooperate with the Chinese Khrushchev's plot to usurp the party and restore the old order.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution thoroughly smashed the Chinese Khrushchev's evil plot to usurp the party and restore the old order. His running dog Chen Dengke and a few pages of moldy "Storm and Thunder" also cannot escape the fate of being thoroughly destroyed!

    《风雷》是怎样贩卖“后十条”的
    宛敬青
      在党的八届十中全会上，我们的伟大领袖毛主席发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召，提出了要进行社会主义教育的伟大任务，吹响了无产阶级向资产阶级反攻的号角。中国赫鲁晓夫见势不妙，立即采取反革命两面派的手法，把社会主义教育运动的口号接过去，加以歪曲、篡改，炮制了极端反动的“后十条”，抛出了一条形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线，力图把运动引向邪路。
    反动小说《风雷》，不仅为中国赫鲁晓夫刮起的翻案风、单干风卖命地呼号；而且使尽了力气为形“左”实右的反动路线呐喊助威。反革命分子陈登科供认：《风雷》是在“后十条”的基础上修改的。
    社会主义教育运动是在一九六三年才开始的。《风雷》却让他的主人公祝永康在一九五四年就开展了一场“社会主义教育运动”，这场“运动”的作法又和中国赫鲁晓夫搞假四清、真复辟的作法完全相同。
      按照毛主席的教导，社会主义教育运动必须“抓住阶级斗争这个纲，抓住社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争这个纲”，解决
  “社会主义和资本主义的矛盾。”中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么运动的性质是“党内外矛盾交叉，或者是敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾交叉”，妄图用所谓的两个“交叉”，抹杀社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，以达到其假四清、真复辟的罪恶目的。
    反革命分子陈登科紧步中国赫鲁晓夫的“足印”，在《风雷》中挖空心思捏造了黄泥乡这样一个“内部矛盾和外部矛盾纠结在一起”的典型。为了表现这个“交叉”，陈登科编造了一串荒诞离奇、肮脏庸俗的人物关系。在陈登科笔下，党的干部、“英雄”人物、反动富农、贫下中农，都被一根亲友关系的纽带连结着：反动富农黄龙飞是区委书记熊彬的老丈人；熊彬是县委书记方旭东的大舅子；方旭东是“英雄”人物祝永康患难与共的老战友；“好干部”任为群的嫂子“贫农”羊秀英又是黄龙飞的姘头……。在这些人物中间，陈登科描写了各种各样的矛盾和斗争，例如阶级敌人和“贫下中农”互相勾结；党内外坏分子串通一气，密谋陷害干部；祝永康和朱锡坤之间以个人恩怨为核心的斗争……真是矛盾重重，错综复杂。但是，在这些“矛盾”和“斗争”中，独独看不到社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的实质。
    按照毛主席的教导，社会主义教育运动，就是要放手发动群众，重点整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派，进一步加强无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟。反动小说《风雷》中的所谓社会主义教育运动，重点整的是什么人呢？是群众。在陈登科的笔下，黄泥乡的群众，坏人成群，坏事成堆，苦大仇深的羊秀英是“破鞋”，讨饭出身的黄大叔是懒汉。他们投机倒把，为非作歹。似乎黄泥乡的问题，就出在他们身上。于是，他们就成为重点挨整的对象。请看，小说中这样的描写，同中国赫鲁晓夫用所谓“有什么问题解决什么问题”的论调，制造种种借口，大整干部，大整群众，推行形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线不是如出一辙吗？
      《风雷》中所进行的“社会主义教育运动”的方法又完全是中国赫鲁晓夫的“暗察私访”、“扎根串连”那一套。中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂反对毛主席历来主张和历来实行的群众路线，反对用阶级分析的方法去向社会作调查，胡说什么“贫下中农不向我们说真话”，“调查会调查不出问题”，把解放十几年后的社会主义新农村，仍然当作“敌占区”，荒唐地搬出了一套所谓“白区工作经验”，主张“工作队进村以后，要进行“秘密工作”，“扎根串连”。
    反动小说《风雷》，以大量的笔墨描写了祝永康隐姓埋名的神奇活动，如“夜访何老九”、“巧遇羊秀英”、“三请陆素云”等等，祝永康的这一套我们并不感到陌生，它和资产阶级分子王××“捂个大口罩，包个大头巾”，在桃园大搞神秘活动完全是一路货！对于这种“私访”，陈登科倍加赞赏，并极力夸大其政治“威力”，竭力宣扬就是用这种方法平反了任为群的“冤案”，揭开了黄泥乡“阶级斗争”的盖子。真是荒唐已极！
    看看祝永康扎下的“根子”和依靠的对象都是些什么人吧：有不通过群众就平了反、翻了案的任为群；有叫嚷“解放以来”“还没翻过身来”的“老贫农”李学成……。祝永康就是利用这一些人，在黄泥乡大刮翻案风，大刮单干风，大搞复辟资本主义活动的。
    反动小说《风雷》，极力宣扬和美化中国赫鲁晓夫形“左”而实右的资产阶级反动路线，就是为了配合中国赫鲁晓夫篡党复辟。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，彻底粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫篡党复辟的罪恶阴谋，他的小娄罗陈登科和几页发了霉的《风雷》，也逃不脱彻底灭亡的命运！〔本版由《新安徽报》供稿〕
