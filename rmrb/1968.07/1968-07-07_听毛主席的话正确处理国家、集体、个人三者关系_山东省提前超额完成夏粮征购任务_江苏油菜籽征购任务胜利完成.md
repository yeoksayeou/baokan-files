Listen to Chairman Mao's Words and Properly Handle the Relationships Between the State, Collective, and Individual

Shandong Province Completes Summer Grain Procurement Task Ahead of Schedule and Exceeds Quota

Jiangsu Province Successfully Completes Rapeseed Procurement Task

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 6th: After achieving a bumper wheat harvest, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Shandong Province, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "We must plan, work, and think from the perspective of our country having 600 million people," have severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist garbage spread by China's Khrushchev regarding grain procurement and distribution, correctly handled the relationships between the state, collective, and individual, and enthusiastically sold summer grain to the state. By July 5th, the entire province had completed the summer grain procurement task ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, full of revolutionary enthusiasm, said: We are selling grain for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, grain to support the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist world revolution!

Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Shandong Province, who have achieved a bumper wheat harvest, always remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "Never forget class struggle," severely grasp class struggle, deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, and regard the completion of the summer grain procurement task as a political battle. Various places have universally held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, use the fields and courtyards as battlefields, and severely criticize China's Khrushchev and his agents' counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Some places have also exposed and criticized class enemies who sabotaged the grain procurement and distribution work, greatly raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and promoting the smooth progress of procurement and distribution work.

In the process of summer grain procurement and distribution, the leading members of various levels of revolutionary committees have followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental thing, is to link up with the masses," and gone deep into the grassroots, together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and participate in productive labor, effectively promoting the summer grain procurement and distribution work.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in various places in Jiangsu Province have achieved a bumper harvest of summer oil crops by combining revolution with production. After achieving a bumper harvest of summer oil crops, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "In the matter of distribution, we must consider the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual," have enthusiastically sold rapeseed to the state. By the end of June, the entire province had completed the rapeseed procurement task ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota.

In the process of enthusiastically selling rapeseed to the state, the poor and lower-middle peasants in various places have deeply carried out revolutionary criticism, severely criticized China's Khrushchev and his agents' reactionary fallacies of "material incentive" and "production for more distribution and more consumption," and smashed the plot of a handful of class enemies to sabotage the procurement work, ensuring the smooth completion of the procurement task.
