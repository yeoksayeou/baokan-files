In the wake of the nationwide political and economic general strike launched by French workers in May, the economic interests of the French monopolistic bourgeoisie have been severely hit, and the position of the French franc has remained unstable.

The general strike by French workers has paralyzed the economic activities of the French ruling class for a long period, making it increasingly difficult for both foreign and French capitalists to invest in France. They have been withdrawing their funds to other capitalist countries. At the same time, the workers' strike has dealt a blow to France's foreign trade, causing the trade deficit to increase sharply. All these factors have led to a continuous decrease in the gold and foreign exchange reserves that the French ruling class has painstakingly accumulated over the years to support the franc.

According to the Bank of France, in the week up to the 18th, France's foreign exchange reserves again decreased by $75 million, bringing the total foreign exchange loss since May to $2.059 billion.

To make up for the loss of foreign exchange, the French ruling class has already withdrawn a large amount of funds from the International Monetary Fund and sold a large amount of gold and dollars.

By the 18th, France's gold and foreign exchange reserves had decreased by nearly 22% compared to the beginning of the workers' strike in May.

The mouthpiece of the French ruling class, Agence France-Presse, said on the 25th in discussing the above situation, "The loss of foreign exchange in France will continue."

According to the French Ministry of Finance, in the first month after the general strike, June, France's foreign trade deficit soared to 1.55 billion francs (approximately $310 million), which is 30 times the foreign trade deficit in May (50 million francs).

    在工人大罢工风暴沉重打击下
    法国法郎地位一直不稳
    新华社二十六日讯巴黎消息：法国工人在五月间发动的全国性政治和经济大罢工，沉重地打击了法国垄断资产阶级的经济利益，法国法郎的地位一直不稳定。
    法国工人的大罢工使法国统治集团的经济活动很长一段时间陷于瘫痪，外国和法国资本家都感到在法国投资越来越困难，纷纷把资金抽到其他资本主义国家；同时，工人的罢工打击了法国的对外贸易，使对外贸易赤字急剧增加。这些都使法国统治集团几年来费尽心机积累起来以支撑法郎的黄金外汇储备不断减少。
    据法兰西银行宣布，到十八日为止的一星期中，法国外汇又流失七千五百万美元，这就使五月以来法国的外汇流失总数高达二十亿零五千九百万美元。
    法国统治集团为弥补外汇流失，已经从国际货币基金组织中提取了大量款项，并出售了大量黄金和美元。
    到十八日为止，法国的黄金外汇储备比五月间工人罢工开始时减少了近百分之二十二。
    法国统治集团的喉舌法新社，二十五日在谈到上述情况时沮丧地说，法国的外汇流失还要继续下去。
    据法国财政部二十四日宣布，在工人大罢工以后的第一个月即六月份，法国对外贸易赤字猛增到十五亿五千万法郎（约合三亿一千万美元），比五月份的对外贸易赤字（五千万法郎）增加了三十倍。
