The revolutionary struggle of the Italian people is flourishing. Student movements, worker movements, and peasant movements have risen one after another, merging into a surging tide of struggle that is fiercely assaulting the reactionary rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie.

The student movement is surging

In this new offensive by the Italian people against monopoly capital, the broad masses of young students are playing a vanguard role. As early as last year, starting from Turin and Milan, nearly thirty universities across the country erupted in struggles against the decadent and backward capitalist education system. In February and March of this year, with the University of Rome as the center, Italian students launched a new struggle. By May and June, inspired by the powerful revolutionary storm of French workers and students, the struggle of Italian students entered a new high tide. The Italian student movement this time is swift and powerful, unprecedented in scale, continuous, and has adopted new forms of struggle such as occupying schools.

Italy's education system is extremely decadent. Currently, some universities still maintain the regulations of the Mussolini era, and many courses are still from before World War I. Therefore, the Italian students' struggle began with demands to reform the decadent and backward education system. However, as the movement deepened, the Italian students' battle cries continued to rise, and the political nature of the struggle became increasingly pronounced. They clearly put forward the slogan of overthrowing the capitalist system, directing their struggle against the reactionary rule of the Italian monopoly bourgeoisie and the aggressive policies of American imperialism; at the same time, they waged an irreconcilable struggle against revisionism and reformism, exposing the betrayal of the Italian revisionist group and the Soviet revisionist group. In the struggle, they began to unite with workers and peasants, supporting each other and fighting side by side. This shows that the political awareness and level of struggle of Italian young students have greatly improved.

The tide of worker struggles is rising

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The student movement is a part of the entire people's movement. The upsurge of the student movement cannot but promote the upsurge of the entire people's movement." Under the impetus of the student movement, the Italian worker movement has also seen new developments.

In recent times, the entire Apennine Peninsula, from south to north, from Sicily to Venice, has seen waves of worker struggles rising and falling, continuously surging. Massive strike struggles and demonstrations have spread widely in many industrial areas and cities. The Italian working masses have displayed a spirit of fearlessness, self-sacrifice, and tenacious struggle in their struggles. In some places, workers' strike struggles have lasted for several months. In some places, workers have set up tents outside factories and established command centers, preparing for a long-term struggle with the capitalists. In some places, workers bravely fought against the reactionary police who came to suppress them. Many cities were paralyzed by worker strikes. The struggles of Italian workers fully demonstrate the great power of the working class.

At the same time, Italian peasants have also begun to take action. Recently, 30,000 small farmers from all over Italy gathered in the capital Rome for an unprecedented large-scale demonstration, protesting against the government's agricultural policies. In other towns, protests and demonstrations continue to break out. Peasant movements are rising in various parts of Italy.

The broad masses are increasingly awakening

The flourishing of the Italian people's movement is a clear sign of the Italian people's increasing awakening.

For a long time, under the reactionary rule of the Italian monopoly bourgeoisie, class contradictions within the country have been intensifying. After the so-called "center-left" government came to power, although it played many deceitful tricks in its domestic and foreign policies, it actually further tightened its exploitation and control of the people domestically and continued to follow a foreign policy of submission to American imperialism. This could not but arouse the increasingly strong opposition of the Italian people. In recent years, the voices of the Italian people opposing the ruthless exploitation of monopoly capital, opposing reactionary rule, and opposing American imperialism's aggression in Vietnam have grown louder, and the struggles have become more intense. They gradually realized from their own experiences that under the capitalist system, no matter what kind of government is in power, it can only represent the interests of the monopoly bourgeoisie. Laboring people want to get rid of their oppressed and exploited status and must firmly stand up and wage a head-on struggle against the evil system of capitalism and the reactionary rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie. For this reason, in Italy, more and more workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals have taken action and joined the revolutionary struggle.

The situation is excellent

Facing the increasingly powerful people's movement, the Italian reactionary authorities are terrified and hurriedly adopt various suppression measures; the Italian revisionist group also desperately cooperates, intensifying its betrayal activities, trying to extinguish the blazing fire of the people's revolutionary struggle. But this is all in vain.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the forward march of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur, and will certainly achieve victory, whether sooner or later."

Currently, the world has entered a great new era of revolution. The revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are raging, and the people's movements in Europe and North America are flourishing. In the face of the deepening political and economic crises in the entire capitalist world, Italy's political situation is in long-term turmoil, and the economy is rapidly deteriorating. The reactionary rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie is becoming increasingly unstable. The situation for the revolutionary struggle of the Italian people is excellent.

Today, the Italian people, who have a glorious tradition of anti-fascist struggle, are in a new awakening. Whether it is the savage suppression of the Italian reactionary authorities or the betrayal activities of the Italian revisionist group, they cannot stop the revolutionary struggle of the Italian people from advancing. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals in Italy will strengthen their unity, persist in their struggles, and launch sustained and fierce attacks on the reactionary rule of the Italian monopoly bourgeoisie. No matter how the struggles may fluctuate, no matter how many twists and turns the future may hold, Italy's future will definitely belong to the heroic Italian people!

### 意大利人民处在新觉醒中

    意大利人民处在新觉醒中
    意大利人民的革命斗争正在蓬勃发展。学生运动、工人运动、农民运动相继兴起，汇合成一股汹涌澎湃的斗争洪流，猛烈地冲击着垄断资产阶级的反动统治。
      学生运动高潮迭起
    在这次意大利人民向垄断资本发动的新的进攻中，广大青年学生起着先锋作用。早在去年年底，从都灵、米兰等地开始，全国近三十所大学爆发了反对腐朽落后的资本主义教育制度的斗争。今年二、三月间，以罗马大学为中心，意大利学生展开了新的斗争。到五、六月间，在法国工人、学生强大革命风暴的有力鼓舞下，意大利学生的斗争又进入了新的高潮。意大利这次学生运动来势迅猛，规模空前，持续不断，并且采取了占领学校等新的斗争形式。
    意大利的教育制度极其腐朽，目前，一些大学里仍然维持着墨索里尼时代的规章制度，不少课程内容还是第一次世界大战以前的。因此，意大利学生的斗争，是从要求改革腐朽落后的教育制度开始爆发的。但是，随着运动的深入发展，意大利学生的战斗口号不断提高，斗争的政治性越来越增强。他们明确地提出了推翻资本主义制度的口号，把斗争矛头指向意大利垄断资产阶级的反动统治和美帝国主义的侵略政策；同时还同修正主义、改良主义进行了不调和的斗争，揭露了意修集团和苏修集团的叛卖行径。在斗争中，他们开始同工农相结合，互相支持，并肩战斗。这表明意大利青年学生的政治觉悟和他们的斗争水平已经大大地提高了一步。
    工人斗争怒潮高涨
    我们的伟大导师毛主席指出：“学生运动是整个人民运动的一部分。学生运动的高涨，不可避免地要促进整个人民运动的高涨。”在学生运动的推动下，意大利工人运动也有新的发展。
    最近以来，整个亚平宁半岛，从南到北，从西西里到威尼斯，意大利工人的斗争怒潮此伏彼起，不断高涨。声势浩大的罢工斗争和示威游行，在许多工矿区和城市广泛展开。意大利工人群众在斗争中发扬了不畏强暴、不怕牺牲、顽强战斗的精神。有的地方，工人的罢工斗争已坚持了几个月。有的地方，工人们在工厂外面搭起帐篷，建立指挥部，准备同资本家进行长期的斗争。有的地方，工人们勇敢地同前来镇压的反动警察进行搏斗。许多城市因工人罢工而使交通陷于瘫痪。意大利工人的斗争，充分显示出工人阶级的强大力量。
    与此同时，意大利农民也开始行动起来。最近，三万名小农从意大利全国各地汇集到首都罗马举行规模空前的示威游行，抗议政府的农业政策。在其他城镇也不断爆发抗议示威。意大利各地的农民运动正在兴起。
    广大人民日益觉醒
    意大利人民运动的蓬勃兴起，是意大利人民日益觉醒的鲜明标志。
    长期以来，在意大利垄断资产阶级的反动统治下，意大利国内阶级矛盾不断激化。所谓“中左”政府上台以后，在内外政策上虽然玩弄了不少欺骗花招，但是，实际上却在国内进一步加紧了对人民的剥削和控制，对外继续奉行屈从美帝国主义的外交政策。这就不能不激起意大利人民日益强烈的反对。近年来，意大利人民反对垄断资本的残酷剥削，反对反动统治，反对美帝侵略越南的呼声越来越高，斗争越来越激烈。他们从切身经历中逐渐认识到，在资本主义制度下，不管是什么名目的政府当政，都只能代表垄断资产阶级的利益。劳动人民要摆脱被压迫、被剥削的地位，只有坚定地站起来，同资本主义的罪恶制度和垄断资产阶级的反动统治进行针锋相对的斗争。正因为这样，在意大利，越来越多的工人、农民和革命的知识分子奋起行动，投入了革命斗争的洪流。
    斗争形势一片大好
    面对日益发展的强大的人民运动，意大利反动当局怕得要死，慌忙采取各种镇压措施；意修集团也竭力配合，加紧进行叛卖活动，妄图把人民革命斗争的熊熊烈火扑灭下去。但是，这完全是徒劳的。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席指出：“不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
    目前，世界已经进入了一个伟大的革命的新时代，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的革命斗争猛烈发展，欧洲、北美的人民运动蓬勃兴起。在整个资本主义世界政治、经济危机不断加深的情况下，意大利政局长期动荡，经济加速恶化，垄断资产阶级的反动统治日益不稳。意大利人民革命斗争的形势大好。
    今天，具有反法西斯斗争的光荣传统的意大利人民，正处在新的觉醒之中。意大利反动当局的野蛮镇压也好，意修集团的叛卖活动也好，都阻挡不住意大利人民革命斗争向前发展。意大利广大工人、农民和革命知识分子必将加强团结，坚持斗争，向意大利垄断资产阶级的反动统治发动持续的、猛烈的进攻。不管斗争还会有怎样的起伏，不管前途还会有多少曲折，意大利的未来，一定是属于英勇的意大利人民的！
