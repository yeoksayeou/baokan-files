The glorious tradition of Jinggangshan, forever shining;
The deep bond between soldiers and civilians, surpassing the ocean...

The heroic people of Jinggangshan, inheriting the glorious tradition of "supporting the military and loving the people" personally established by the great leader Chairman Mao on Jinggangshan, cherish the People's Liberation Army as they did the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in the past. In the battle to rescue a small detachment of the People's Liberation Army that was trapped under collapsed houses due to a tornado, they composed a deeply moving new song of military support with their profound proletarian feelings.

On May 16th, the soldiers of the 96th detachment of the 6812th unit of the People's Liberation Army, who were stationed in Hongqi Commune under Jinggangshan to support the left, held a grand meeting to celebrate the second anniversary of the publication of the epoch-making brilliant document, the May 16th Notice, personally directed by Chairman Mao. The soldiers returned to their barracks and immediately focused on studying and formulating action plans to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. No one expected that at this moment, the weather suddenly changed: after a series of thunderclaps, a powerful tornado struck, and torrential rain poured down simultaneously. Towering trees were instantly blown and bent in all directions. In an instant, a deafening roar echoed, and the barracks of the 96th detachment collapsed...

Just as the barracks collapsed, drowning out the crashing of beams and tiles and the howling wind and rain, was the loudest cry from the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, their hearts filled with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao:

"Long live Chairman Mao!"
"Chairman Mao is immortal!"

The news of the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army being trapped under collapsed houses due to the tornado spread in all directions. The nearby post office immediately called to report the emergency. The staff of the grain supply department, despite the wind and rain, rode their bicycles to report the urgent news. Passing drivers, upon hearing the news, immediately turned their vehicles towards the scene. The people of Jinggangshan, despite the losses brought by the storm, left their houses with roofs blown off and children in their arms, and rushed towards the barracks of the People's Liberation Army. Red Guards from schools in the city, not knowing how many people they had overtaken, still felt their steps were too slow. Their hearts, like everyone else's, had already flown to the side of their comrades in the People's Liberation Army. The people of Jinggangshan would never forget the deep bond of blood and flesh between their parents and the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army on the battlefield of defending the hundred-li Jinggangshan under Chairman Mao's leadership. Today, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the good descendants of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army—the People's Liberation Army—are fighting shoulder to shoulder with them to thoroughly smash the capitalist restoration plots of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and all class enemies. They have forged a new deep friendship in battle. Upon hearing that their comrades in the People's Liberation Army were in danger, they were anxious as if their own hearts had been torn out.

The leaders of the Revolutionary Committees of Jinggangshan District and nearby counties and cities, as well as the military commanders, all personally directed the rescue operations on the scene. People from all directions rushed into the intense rescue battle. Everyone was afraid of hurting their comrades, throwing away their picks, and frantically digging through the tiles and bricks with their hands. The sharp edges of the broken tiles cut their fingers to the bone, and the nails pierced their feet, causing blood to flow, but no one paid attention to these injuries. The members of Hongqi Commune who rushed to the rescue had many of their palms already bloody and mangled, but they gritted their teeth and continued to dig. Many Red Guards had their feet pierced by nails, but they still bravely took the lead. Medical staff urgently bandaged the rescued wounded soldiers and quickly sent them to the hospital in batches.

The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, rescued from the rubble, did not think of themselves upon regaining consciousness. The first thing they asked for was the revolutionary treasure, the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and the first question they asked was, "How are our comrades?" Lying on the stretcher, they always kept the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" tightly pressed to their hearts. Soldier Hu Defu had severe internal injuries. To alleviate his pain, the doctor gave him an anesthetic. He gradually fell into a drowsy state, and his hand holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" slowly dropped. When the doctor gently placed the revolutionary treasure under his pillow, the soldier, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, immediately woke up, looking around for the revolutionary treasure. The doctor quickly returned the revolutionary treasure to his hand. Hu Defu tightly held the revolutionary treasure to his chest before gradually falling into a drowsy state again.

The usually quiet Jinggangshan Hospital suddenly became tense. All medical staff prepared the rescue equipment at the fastest speed. Doctors and nurses who had already gone home rushed back in the rain, not even changing their clothes before joining the rescue battle. Doctors and nurses from other medical units also rushed over, volunteering to be assigned tasks. Still, more people surged into the hospital, demanding to help rescue their comrades in the People's Liberation Army. Red Guards, with tears in their eyes, surrounded the doctors and nurses, pleading, "Uncle, Auntie! What else needs to be done? Let us do it!"

The people of Jinggangshan understand class love the best; they have only one wish: to contribute everything for rescuing their comrades in the People's Liberation Army!

Time is life. The intense surgical rescue operation began. Under the bright surgical lights, the doctors worked with full concentration. They had not rested for over thirty hours. Mao Zedong Thought gave them boundless strength, and class feelings gave them unyielding willpower. They worked tirelessly, tenaciously rescuing their comrades' lives.

At two or three in the morning, many workers, peasants, and Red Guards were still guarding their comrades' beds, huddled by the windows in the pouring rain. When their comrades' hands and feet turned cold, they warmed them with their bodies. They took off their clothes and brought their blankets, gently covering them on their comrades. When their comrades showed signs of pain on their faces, they read from the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," "Resolutely carry out the decision, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," adding boundless strength to their comrades. They eagerly helped the nurses feed their injured comrades soup and water, dress their wounds, and wipe them down.

The wounded soldiers needed blood transfusions due to excessive bleeding. As soon as the news came out from the operating room, thousands of people rushed to the hospital like a tide. People shouted, "We want to donate blood! We want to donate blood!" At the door of the laboratory, people, with tears in their eyes, stretched out their arms, holding onto the doctors. A worker, whom the doctor said was not strong enough to donate blood, begged, "Even if I can only donate a few drops of blood, it would be my heart's desire." More than twenty young workers simply ordered the doctor, "For our comrades in the People's Liberation Army, the working class has plenty of blood! Hurry up and take it!" The doctors were also moved to tears and had to take out the blood collection device. The blood of the people of Jinggangshan was thus continuously sent to their comrades in the People's Liberation Army.

At the same time, outside the hospital, countless people were still busy rescuing their comrades' lives. The workers of the power plant, to ensure the hospital's power supply, braved the thunderstorm and the danger of electric shock, straightened the power poles blown over by the wind, and reconnected the broken lines, completing three days' work in just two hours to ensure the power supply. To ensure the hospital could provide oxygen to the wounded comrades, the drivers and farmers at the ferry crossing braved the thunderstorm, day and night, on the mountain roads and by the river. The staff of the pharmaceutical company guarded the warehouse every moment, sending whatever medicine the wounded comrades needed. For their comrades in the People's Liberation Army, the people of Jinggangshan, with their profound proletarian feelings, remembered the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings, "Carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, fearing no sacrifice, fearing no fatigue, and continuous fighting (that is, fighting continuously without rest for a short period)," and fought on their posts.

One by one, the wounded soldiers of the People's Liberation Army were rescued. The people of Jinggangshan, carrying the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, holding high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," beating drums and gongs, continuously went to the hospital and the military barracks to visit their comrades. The Red Guards made a giant "loyalty" character with shining Mao badges, sending their boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. Many people held portraits of Chairman Mao and four volumes of revolutionary treasures, sending the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The rural women, using their clothes to carry eggs, just like the people of Jinggangshan comforting the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in the past, sent them to their comrades in the People's Liberation Army...

The people of Jinggangshan, with their boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, composed a new song of military support with their deep love for their comrades in the People's Liberation Army. Today, soldiers and civilians under Jinggangshan and throughout Jiangxi are launching a new high tide of "supporting the military and loving the people." The deep bond of blood and flesh between soldiers and civilians is inspiring the people of Jinggangshan to achieve new victories in the battle to win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

### 井冈山下的一曲拥军新歌

    井冈山下的一曲拥军新歌
    井冈山的传统啊，
    永放光芒；
    军民情深哟，胜过
      海洋……
    英雄的井冈山儿女，接过伟大领袖毛主席当年在井冈山亲手树立的“拥军爱民”的光荣传统，象当年爱护工农红军那样，在抢救井冈山下因龙卷风屋塌遇难的人民解放军一支小分队的战斗中，用无比深厚的无产阶级感情，谱写出了一曲感人肺腑的拥军新歌。
    五月十六日，在井冈山下红旗公社执行支左任务的解放军六八一二部队九六分队的指战员，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心，和贫下中农一起，隆重举行了欢呼毛主席亲自主持制定的划时代光辉文献五·一六《通知》发表两周年的盛大集会。指战员们回到驻地，立即全神贯注地投入了研究制定紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的行动计划。谁也没有料到，就在这时，天气突然起了变化：一连串的闷雷过后，一股强大的龙卷风袭来，倾盆大雨也同时铺天盖地而来。参天大树顿时被吹打得东倒西歪，刹那间，一声震耳欲聋的轰鸣，九六分队的房子倒塌了……
    就在塌房的这一刹那，盖过房梁瓦砾轰鸣而下和狂风暴雨的，是解放军指战员们用无限忠于毛主席的一颗颗红心汇成的最强音：
    “毛主席万岁！”
      “毛主席万万岁！”
    解放军同志因龙卷风屋塌遇难的消息，立即传向四面八方。附近小邮电所马上打电话向各处告急。粮管所的同志，不顾风吹雨打，也蹬上自行车四处报告急讯。路过的汽车司机闻讯，立刻掉转车头奔往现场。井冈山的儿女们，不顾狂风暴雨给自己带来的损失，他们丢下被掀去屋顶的房子，扔下手里的孩子，就不约而同地朝解放军驻地飞奔而来。远在城里的各个中学的红卫兵小将，不知赶过了多少飞跑的人群，但还是嫌自己的脚步太慢，他们的心，象所有的人一样，早已飞到了亲人解放军的身旁。井冈山的儿女们，个个都不会忘记自己的父辈在毛主席领导下，同工农红军在保卫百里井冈山的战场上结下的血肉深情；今天，在毛主席亲自发动和亲自领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，工农红军的好后代——解放军，为了彻底粉碎党内一小撮走资派和一切阶级敌人复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，又和他们并肩战斗，结下了新的深厚的战斗友谊。他们一听说亲人解放军遇险，着急得就象摘掉了自己的心一样。
    井冈山专区以及附近县、市革命委员会的领导人和部队首长，都亲临现场指挥抢救。来自四面八方的人们，火速投入了紧张的抢救战斗。人们生怕伤着了亲人，扔掉镐头，用手拚命地扒瓦片，掀砖头。刀刃似的破瓦割得人十指连心痛，铁钉扎得人们的脚鲜血直流，但是没有人顾到这些。前来抢救的红旗公社的社员们，许多人手掌已经血肉模糊，仍然咬紧牙关，使劲在扒。许多红卫兵小将的脚上被铁钉扎了一些窟窿，还是奋勇当先。医护人员紧急地为抢救出来的伤员包扎，又火速一批批地把伤员送往医院。
    从砖头瓦砾中被抢救出来的解放军指战员，从昏迷中苏醒过来后，丝毫没有想到自己。他们要的第一样东西是革命宝书《毛主席语录》，问的第一句话是“战友们怎么样。”他们躺在担架上，总是把《毛主席语录》紧紧地贴在自己的心窝上。战士胡得福，内脏受了重伤，为了减轻他的痛苦，医生给他打了麻醉药。他渐渐地昏睡过去，紧握着《毛主席语录》的手渐渐往下垂落。当医生轻轻地把他手中的《毛主席语录》放到枕头底下时，无限忠于毛主席的战士立刻惊醒过来，四处张望，寻找革命宝书。医生马上又把革命宝书送到他的手里，胡得福紧紧地把革命宝书捧在自己的胸前，才渐渐昏睡过去。
    往日平静的井冈山医院顿时紧张起来。全院的医护人员，以最快的速度准备好了抢救器械，已经下班回家的医生、护士们都闻讯冒雨赶来，他们连衣服也顾不上换就投入了抢救战斗。其它医疗单位的医生和护士也纷纷主动赶来，要求立即分配工作。还有不知多少人涌进医院，要求为抢救亲人解放军出力。一个个的红卫兵小将们，含着眼泪围着医生护士恳求说：“叔叔阿姨！还要干什么，要我们干吧！”
    井冈山儿女们最懂得阶级爱，他们只有一个愿望：为了抢救亲人解放军，我们愿意贡献出自己的一切！
    时间就是生命。紧张的手术抢救工作开始了。雪亮的手术灯下，医生们全神贯注地工作着。他们已经三十多个小时没有休息了。毛泽东思想使他们浑身是力量，阶级感情给了他们坚强的毅力，他们只是一股劲地工作着，顽强地抢救着亲人的生命。
    深夜两三点钟，许多工人、农民、红卫兵小将仍然守在亲人的床前，簇拥在风雨交加的窗外。亲人的手脚凉了，他们就用自己的体温去温暖他。他们脱下自己的衣服，拿来自己的被子，轻轻地盖在亲人的身上。伤员的脸上有了苦痛的表情，他们就朗读毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，为亲人们增添无穷的力量。他们争着帮助护士给受伤的亲人一口一口地喂汤、喂水、包伤口、抹澡。
    伤员由于失血过多，需要输血。消息一从手术室传出，成千上万人潮水般涌向医院。人们高喊着：“我们要献血！我们要献血！”化验室门口，人们一个个噙着热泪，伸出胳膊，抓住医生不放。有一个工人，医生说他身体不壮，不要他献血，他苦苦央求：那怕让他献上几西西血，也算尽了自己的心意。有二十多个青年工人干脆向医生下“命令”：“为了亲人解放军，我们工人阶级有的是血！快抽吧！”医生也感动得眼眶湿润了，只好拿起抽血器。井冈山儿女们的鲜血，就这样不断地送到了亲人解放军的身上。
    在这同时，医院的外面，不知还有多少人在为抢救亲人的生命而奔忙着。电厂的工人为了保证医院用电，冒着雷雨下触电的危险，把被狂风吹得东倒西歪的电线杆竖起，把断了的线路接通，只用两小时就完成了三天的工作量，保证了供电。为了保证医院给受伤的亲人输氧，汽车司机和渡口的农民们，冒着雷雨，日夜奔波在山道上，巡回在河边。药材公司的职工每时每刻守候在仓库边，受伤的亲人需要什么药，他们就立刻送来什么药。为了亲人解放军，井冈山儿女们怀着无比深厚的无产阶级感情，牢记伟大领袖毛主席“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风”的教导，奋战在各个岗位上。
    一个个遇险负伤的解放军指战员得救了。井冈山儿女们，抬着毛主席的巨幅画像，高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，敲锣打鼓，络绎不绝地前往医院和部队驻地慰问亲人。红卫兵小将用金光闪闪的毛主席像章，嵌成一个巨大的“忠”字，送来了红卫兵战友对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心。还有许多人手捧毛主席像和四卷革命宝书，送来了战无不胜的毛泽东思想。农村妇女们，用衣襟兜着一个个鸡蛋，象当年井冈山人民慰问工农红军那样，送给亲人解放军……
    井冈山儿女们用无限忠于毛主席的一颗颗红心，用对亲人解放军的无比热爱，谱写了一支拥军的新歌。今天，军民在井冈山下，在江西全境，正在掀起一个“拥军爱民”的新高潮。军民之间血肉相连的情谊，正鼓舞着井冈山的儿女们，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗中再立新功！
