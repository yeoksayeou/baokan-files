The broad masses of revolutionary people and the People's Liberation Army in Beijing, including the Beijing Garrison and the broad cadres and soldiers executing the "three supports, two militaries" tasks in Beijing, are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call for "supporting the army and loving the people." Before the August 1st Army Day, they are enthusiastically carrying out various commemorative activities to welcome the 41st anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army.

The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee issued a notice on the 27th regarding the commemoration of the 41st anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army. The notice pointed out that at a time when the hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel across the country are advancing rapidly to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is of great significance to carry out activities commemorating the 41st anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army is the great army personally founded by our great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. It is a powerful pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, a steel wall defending the socialist motherland, and a strong backing for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, following the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin to "hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," have made immortal contributions in executing the "three supports, two militaries" and defending the motherland and other tasks. The notice requires the revolutionary masses of the whole city to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great instruction of "the whole nation learning from the People's Liberation Army," taking the PLA as a shining example, being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They should closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, deeply carry out the great criticism, do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks, and promote revolution and production. They should continuously consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination. The broad revolutionary masses should believe in and rely on the PLA more, support and love the PLA, strengthen military-civilian unity, and actively and enthusiastically help the PLA in their units to do a good job in the "three supports, two militaries" work. They should be vigilant against the class enemies who stir up military-civilian relations and sabotage military-civilian unity.

In recent days, many factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, schools, and rural people's communes in the city have held or are preparing to hold commemorative meetings, report meetings, military-civilian banquets, symposiums, and other celebratory activities. The Beijing Chemical Factory held a military-civilian symposium in some workshops to review the implementation of the "support-the-army pact" and revolutionary workers decided to carry out support-the-army activities better. The responsible comrades of the Pinggu County Revolutionary Committee have been visiting the local garrison and recuperating personnel in recent days to solicit their opinions on the work of the revolutionary committee. The county revolutionary committee also held a symposium with the PLA representatives executing the "three supports, two militaries" tasks in the county. Beijing Caochangdi Middle School, which has achieved great results in various aspects since the military training, has recently carried out extensive activities to learn from the PLA. The broad revolutionary teachers and students are preparing to visit the families of martyrs and military personnel in units of the off-campus Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

The Beijing Garrison, which guards beside our great leader Chairman Mao, and the units executing the "three supports, two militaries" tasks in Beijing have sent tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in recent days to go deep into factories, rural areas, institutions, and schools. They have propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the broad revolutionary masses, jointly held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and jointly discussed the great significance of "supporting the army and loving the people," exchanging experiences in "supporting the army and loving the people." Many cadres and soldiers have restudied Chairman Mao's great teachings on "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses." With the spirit of "persisting in what is good for the people and correcting what is wrong for the people," they have thoroughly and comprehensively reviewed the "three supports, two militaries" work, listened to the masses' criticisms, and expressed their determination to hold high the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," carry forward the glorious traditions of the people's army, bring the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army to the local areas, enthusiastically help the revolutionary committees at all levels, support the revolutionary committees at all levels, unite all forces that can be united, and resolutely fight against a handful of class enemies to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 28th: In the midst of the victory songs of seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad military and civilian personnel of Shanghai, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, are enthusiastically carrying out support-the-army, love-the-people activities to welcome the 41st anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army.

The Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee issued a decision on celebrating the 41st anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, pointing out that strengthening military-civilian unity is an important guarantee for seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The PLA stationed in Shanghai's land, sea, and air forces also issued a decision to strengthen support-the-government, love-the-people activities, requiring the troops to further do a good job in the "three supports, two militaries" work, strengthen war preparedness, and successfully complete the glorious tasks of defending the great motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In recent days, Shanghai has been filled with the revolutionary atmosphere of military loving the people and the people supporting the military. The broad cadres and soldiers of the three services stationed in Shanghai have actively supported, firmly supported, enthusiastically helped, and bravely defended the newly born revolutionary committees, armed the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, as the fundamental task of supporting the government and loving the people. They have organized special personnel to hold symposiums, heart-to-heart talks, banquets, and experience-sharing meetings, solicited the opinions of the revolutionary masses, reviewed and revised the "love-the-people pact." The "Model Eighth Company on Nanjing Road" once helped the Tongjia Alley Production Team to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class. Recently, the cadres and soldiers went to the Tongjia Alley Production Team to solicit opinions. The revolutionary masses were extremely excited and enthusiastically praised the Eighth Company's cadres and soldiers for their greatest love for Chairman Mao and their strongest support for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, calling them models of supporting the government and loving the people. They decided to take the Eighth Company as an example, to read Chairman Mao's books for life, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao! The cadres and soldiers of the Eighth Company expressed their determination to hold high the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people" and to further strengthen military-civilian unity.

The People's Armed Forces Department of Chuansha County recently helped the county revolutionary committee to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class, severely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power, exposing the saboteurs of the streamlined and efficient administration, seriously summarizing experiences, daring to practice, jumping out of the old organizational framework, and resolutely taking the path of streamlined and efficient administration. When the People's Armed Forces Department of Chuansha County solicited the opinions of the revolutionary committee, the responsible comrades and the revolutionary warriors of the proletariat of the revolutionary committee tightly held their hands and said: Whenever we encounter difficulties, you are always united with us and fighting with us, helping us to consolidate and develop the revolutionary committees. We will definitely be more modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and strive to achieve new merits for the people.

Before the August 1st Army Day, many factories, schools, and rural people's communes in Shanghai carried out activities to learn from the PLA, deciding to be like the PLA, infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Like the PLA, they actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and earnestly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The revolutionary committee of the Shanghai Dongchang Shipyard and the responsible comrades of the revolutionary mass organizations held symposiums and heart-to-heart talks with the PLA stationed in the factory to learn from the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on "supporting the army and loving the people," review the glorious course of joint struggle, and decide to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, deeply carry out the great criticism, do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks and streamlined and efficient administration, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The proletarian revolutionary masses of the Shanghai Third Steel Plant, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, reviewed and revised the "support-the-army pact" in the past two days, deciding to learn from the PLA and further strengthen military-civilian unity.

Before the holiday, Shanghai No. 6 Middle School (formerly No. 6 Girls' School) launched a wave of learning from the PLA. Many classes set up special columns and held symposiums, praising and extolling the greatness of the People's Liberation Army personally founded by the great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin; praising and extolling the great achievements of the PLA in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; praising and extolling the advanced thoughts and deeds of the PLA who came to the school for military and political training, being infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary teachers and students decided to be like the PLA, always put proletarian politics in command, insist on the four firsts, carry forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, and under the help of the PLA, turn the school into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.
