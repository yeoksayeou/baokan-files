The Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai Dongfanghong Shipyard, with the enthusiastic assistance of military representatives stationed at the factory, has placed a strong emphasis on proletarian politics and intensified class struggle. They have launched unrelenting attacks on class enemies, achieving splendid victories in both revolution and production. This year, the factory's production has risen sharply month by month, setting new historical records for the shortest shipbuilding cycle.

Dongfanghong Shipyard is a large-scale enterprise. After the Revolutionary Committee was established in August last year, some comrades became complacent and underestimated the situation, believing that it was time to focus on production and the living conditions of the workers. The factory's Revolutionary Committee temporarily became preoccupied with administrative tasks. Upon noticing this trend, the military representatives discussed with the committee members and organized a class on Mao Zedong Thought, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings on never forgetting class struggle and his latest instructions. Through study and discussion, everyone realized that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, being a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, must undergo intense and repeated class struggles. The process of consolidating and developing the Revolutionary Committee is a serious class struggle.

Based on a unified understanding, the Revolutionary Committee organized the broad revolutionary masses to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle. They thoroughly reviewed the history of class struggle within the factory and discussed the new characteristics and trends of class struggle. They discovered that some so-called "repentant" capitalist roaders were still fiercely counterattacking, attempting to undermine the Revolutionary Committee. Therefore, they further mobilized the revolutionary masses throughout the factory to launch sustained and fierce attacks on class enemies.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." In the struggle against enemies, military representatives continuously, together with the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee, used Chairman Mao's great teachings to propagate, arm, and organize the masses. They deeply understood that only by following Chairman Mao's teachings to distinguish between enemies, ourselves, and friends, can we unite all forces that can be united and accurately and decisively strike a small handful of class enemies. For those who have made mistakes, the Revolutionary Committee encouraged them to bravely stand up and fight against class enemies. Military representatives also timely helped the revolutionary masses overcome the tendency to relax the revolutionary criticism, making the revolutionary criticism throughout the factory surge higher and deeper. Now, from the factory department to the workshops and work teams, everywhere has become a battlefield for revolutionary criticism. The revolutionary criticism has greatly raised the class struggle consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary masses. The spiritual face of the broad revolutionary masses has undergone significant changes, driving production to develop continuously.

    上海东方红造船厂革委会大力突出无产阶级政治
    狠抓阶级斗争　生产不断发展
    据新华社上海二十日电　上海东方红造船厂革委会在驻厂军代表热情帮助下大力突出无产阶级政治，狠抓阶级斗争，不停顿地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，夺取了全厂革命和生产的辉煌胜利。今年以来，这个厂生产逐月大幅度地上升，连续创造了船台周期的最高历史纪录。
    东方红造船厂是一个大型企业。去年八月成立革委会后，在一片报喜声中，有些同志产生了麻痹轻敌思想，认为现在已经到了抓生产和抓职工生活的时候了，厂革委会一度出现忙于抓事务的现象。军代表发现这种倾向后，就和厂革委会同志一起商量，举办毛泽东思想学习班，带着问题，反复学习毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导和毛主席的最新指示。通过学习和讨论，大家认识到无产阶级文化大革命，既然是无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，就不能不经历十分剧烈的反复的阶级斗争。革命委员会巩固、发展的过程，是一个严重的阶级斗争的过程。
    在统一认识的基础上，革委会组织广大革命群众认真学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，大摆厂里阶级斗争史，大议阶级斗争的新特点、新动向。大家发现，有些所谓“认罪了，没啥批头”的走资派，还在猖狂反扑，企图搞垮革命委员会。于是，他们又进一步动员全厂革命群众，向阶级敌人发动持续猛烈的进攻。
    毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”在对敌斗争中，军代表不断和革委会领导成员一起，用毛主席这一伟大教导宣传群众、武装群众、组织群众。他们深刻体会到：只有按照毛主席的教导，分清敌、我、友，才能团结一切可以团结的力量，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。对于犯了错误的人，革委会启发他们勇敢地站出来同阶级敌人进行斗争。军队代表还及时帮助革命群众克服曾经一度出现的放松革命大批判的倾向，使全厂革命大批判一浪高过一浪，步步深入。现在，从厂部到车间班组，到处都成了革命大批判的战场。革命的大批判，大大提高了革命群众的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。广大革命群众的精神面貌发生很大变化，推动生产不断发展。
