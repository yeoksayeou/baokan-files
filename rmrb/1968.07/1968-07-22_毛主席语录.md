	Colleges must still be run, and I am mainly talking about colleges of science and technology. The system of education must be shortened, education must be revolutionized, and proletarian politics must take command. We must follow the path of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant in training technical personnel from among the workers. We must select students from among workers and peasants who have practical experience, send them to school for a few years of study, and then have them return to production practice.

    毛主席语录
