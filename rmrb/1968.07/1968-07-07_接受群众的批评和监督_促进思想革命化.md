Members of the Shanghai Valve Factory Revolutionary Committee have gone deep into the masses, acting as students of the people, and together with the masses, they have engaged in class struggle and production struggle. The authority of the Revolutionary Committee has grown increasingly high, gaining the trust and support of the broad masses.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 5th: Members of the Shanghai Valve Factory Revolutionary Committee, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "The most fundamental aspect of reforming state organs is to link with the masses," have closely connected with the masses, making the Revolutionary Committee deeply rooted among the masses and gaining the trust and support of the revolutionary masses. The authority of the Revolutionary Committee has grown increasingly high, becoming a revolutionary, mass-linked, and vigorous battle command center.

After the Shanghai Valve Factory Revolutionary Committee was established in May last year, for a period of time, due to the leadership members being busy handling specific matters, the connection with the masses was weakened, and the class struggle situation in the factory was not well grasped. The factory experienced a period of severe anarchist tendencies, and production tasks were not completed well. Some members of the Revolutionary Committee, in order to change this situation, did not consult much with the masses but instead formulated a set of regulations for the masses to observe labor discipline, with poor results. The masses criticized the Revolutionary Committee's leadership style of being detached from the masses and sincerely requested that the members of the Revolutionary Committee go deep into the masses, together with the masses to seize the revolution and promote production.

The masses' criticism greatly educated the members of the Revolutionary Committee. They immediately organized a study class for the members of the factory Revolutionary Committee to participate in, seriously studying Chairman Mao's brilliant works "The Five Articles," using the standard of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people to demand of themselves. They reviewed the scenes from the great "January Revolution" storm, where they, together with the masses, eagerly studied Chairman Mao's works, labored together, and fought side by side in wind and rain, realizing that after taking power, their relationship with the masses had become more distant. To change this situation, they must firmly grasp the root of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, firmly grasp class struggle, carry out a thorough criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, eliminate the bureaucratic style left by the old organization, insist on using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle in all work, carry forward the Party's style of closely linking with the masses, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and place themselves under the supervision of the masses. Therefore, the Revolutionary Committee decided that all standing committee members, except for one person who stays to handle daily work on a rotating basis, would all go deep into the workshops and teams.

"Navigating the ocean relies on the helmsman, doing revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." After the members of the Revolutionary Committee went deep into the teams, they firmly grasped the root of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, insisting on "daily reading" with the masses, leading the way in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, leading the way in fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, and quickly creating a mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought throughout the factory.

Chairman Mao taught: "Never forget class struggle." Members of the Revolutionary Committee, together with the masses in the workshops and teams, seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, relying on the masses, leading the masses, and launching a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies. The machinist workshop had a period of severe anarchist tendencies, with sharp class struggle. The Revolutionary Committee sent three standing committee members to this workshop. They, together with the masses, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is the continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Through study, everyone's eyes were brightened, discovering a capitalist roader secretly colluding with landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, attempting to reverse the case. This capitalist roader also secretly incited anarchism, plotting to split the revolutionary ranks and sabotage the Revolutionary Committee. The Revolutionary Committee seized these facts of class struggle, mobilizing the masses to deeply criticize the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and the revisionist party line of the Chinese Khrushchev, further raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. Now, the revolutionary criticism throughout the factory is booming, creating a situation where workshops, teams, and individuals all participate in the criticism.

After the members of the Shanghai Valve Factory Revolutionary Committee went deep into the workshops and teams, they, with the attitude of ordinary laborers, together with the masses, seized the revolution and promoted production. Some places with hard labor, such as foundry and forging workshops, were places that capitalist roaders used to fear going to, but the members of the Revolutionary Committee actively went to these places. In the process of participating in production labor, the members of the Revolutionary Committee personally felt the boundless enthusiasm and infinite wisdom of the workers in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, greatly inspiring and educating them, making production significantly increase.

The members of the Revolutionary Committee also, according to Chairman Mao's teachings on carrying out criticism and self-criticism, actively accepted the masses' criticism and supervision, accelerating their ideological revolution. The new and old cadres of the Revolutionary Committee brought various opinions heard from the masses to the Revolutionary Committee for discussion, in order to improve work and style, ensuring that the Revolutionary Committee advances along the direction pointed by Chairman Mao.

The members of the Shanghai Valve Factory Revolutionary Committee, by going deep into the masses, leading the masses in class struggle and production struggle, have an increasingly close relationship with the masses. The workers regard the members of the Revolutionary Committee as both representatives of the masses and members of the masses, therefore, they are close to them, support them, and cherish them everywhere; the members of the Revolutionary Committee also regard themselves as students of the masses, actively placing themselves under the supervision of the masses, and together with the masses, unconditionally implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, making the Revolutionary Committee deeply rooted among the masses, and continuously consolidating and developing.

    接受群众的批评和监督　促进思想革命化
    上海阀门一厂革委会成员深入群众，当群众的小学生，同群众一起进行阶级斗争和生产斗争，革委会的威信越来越高，得到广大群众的信任和支持
    据新华社上海五日电　上海阀门一厂革命委员会成员，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的伟大教导，密切同群众的联系，使革委会深深扎根于群众之中，得到了广大革命群众的信任和支持。革命委员会的威信越来越高，成为一个革命的、联系群众的、朝气蓬勃的战斗指挥部。
    上海阀门一厂革委会在去年五月成立后，开始一段时期，由于领导成员忙于处理具体事务，结果减弱了同群众的联系，没有能很好地把厂里的阶级斗争动向掌握起来。厂里无政府主义思潮一度比较严重，生产任务完成得不好。革委会的有些成员为了改变这种状况，没有多和群众商量，就订出了一项要群众遵守劳动纪律的规定，结果效果不好。群众对革委会这种脱离群众的领导作风提出了批评，他们热情而又诚恳地要求革委会成员深入到群众中来，同群众一起抓革命、促生产。
    群众的批评，使革委会成员受到很大教育。他们立即举办了一个由厂革委会成员参加的毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习毛主席的光辉著作“老五篇”，以“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的标准来要求自己。他们回顾了在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中，和群众一起如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，一起劳动，风里雨里并肩战斗的情景，认识到自己掌权以后，同群众的关系比过去疏远了。而要改变这种状况，就要狠抓活学活用毛主席著作这个根本，狠抓阶级斗争，搞好对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线的大批判，清除旧机构遗留下来的官僚主义作风，坚持在一切工作中用毛泽东思想挂帅，发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风，相信群众，依靠群众，把自己置于群众的监督之下。于是，革委会作出决定，所有常委除留一人每天轮流值班处理日常工作以外，其他成员都深入到车间、班组去。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”革委会成员深入班组以后，狠狠抓住活学活用毛泽东思想这个根本，坚持和群众一起“天天读”，带头学好用好毛泽东思想，带头斗私批修，全厂迅速出现群众性的活学活用毛泽东思想的热潮。
    毛主席教导说：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”革委会成员在车间、班组里和群众一起认真学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，依靠群众，带领群众，坚决向一小撮阶级敌人猛烈进攻。金工车间前一时期无政府主义比较严重，阶级斗争尖锐。革委会就派了三个常委到这个车间去。他们和群众一起学习了毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”通过学习，大家擦亮了眼睛，发现一个走资派暗地里和地、富、反、坏分子勾勾搭搭，妄图翻案。这个走资派还在背地里煽动无政府主义，阴谋分裂革命队伍，搞垮革命委员会。革委会抓住这些阶级斗争的事实，发动群众深入批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论和修正主义建党路线，进一步提高了革命群众和革命干部的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。现在，全厂革命大批判搞得热火朝天，出现了车间批、班组批、人人批的局面。
    阀门一厂革委会成员深入车间、班组以后，以普通劳动者的姿态和群众一道抓革命、促生产。一些劳动艰苦的地方，如翻砂、锻打等车间，是过去走资派最怕去的地方，而革委会成员便积极地到这些地方去。在参加生产劳动过程中，革委会成员亲身感受到工人们在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲和无穷智慧，使生产大幅度上升，受到很大的鼓舞和教育。
    革委会成员还根据毛主席关于开展批评和自我批评的教导，主动地接受群众的批评和监督，加速自己的思想革命化。革委会新老干部把从群众中听到的各种意见带到革委会上来讨论，以便改进工作，改进作风，保证革命委员会沿着毛主席指引的方向不断前进。
    上海阀门一厂革委会成员深入群众，带领群众在阶级斗争和生产斗争中打进攻战，同群众的关系越来越密切。工人们把革委会成员看成既是群众的代表，又是群众中的一员，因而处处亲近他们，支持他们，爱护他们；革委会的成员也把自己看作是群众的小学生，主动把自己放在群众的监督之下，和群众一起不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的指示，使革命委员会深深扎根于群众之中，不断得到巩固和发展。
