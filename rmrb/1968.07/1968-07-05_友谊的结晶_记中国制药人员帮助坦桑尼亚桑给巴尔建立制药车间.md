In recent days, many friends from Zanzibar in Tanzania have visited the largest hospital on Zanzibar Island, the Lenin Hospital, to tour the pharmaceutical workshop established with the help of Chinese pharmaceutical workers. Several Zanzibar pharmaceutical trainees, dressed in clean white uniforms, are diligently operating automatic rotary tablet presses, electric sugar-coating machines, and electric high-pressure sterilizers. The shelves on either side are lined with rows of medicine bottles containing over forty kinds of injections and tablets produced by this workshop to treat common diseases, including glucose, tetracycline, and ferrous sulfate, among others.

These medicines, after being tested, meet the standards of the pharmacopoeia and have shown good clinical efficacy. Their quantity has basically met the needs of all hospitals in Zanzibar.

Walking the Path of Self-Reliance

When many visitors see the labels on the bottles of medicine that read "Produced under the supervision of the Zanzibar Ministry of Health," they cannot help but feel excited and proud. They thank Chairman Mao for sending Chinese pharmaceutical workers to help them take the path of self-reliance in pharmaceutical production, and at the same time, they cannot help but recall the past when they had to rely entirely on importing medicines from Britain. At that time, not only were the medicine prices high, but often the medicines could not be delivered in time, delaying treatment, and some patients even lost their lives as a result.

The colonialists, in order to make huge profits, mystified pharmaceutical production and monopolized pharmaceutical technology, attempting to exploit the African people for a long time. When the visiting friends from Zanzibar compare the low cost of producing medicines in this workshop with the high prices of imported medicines from Britain, they cannot help but condemn the brutal exploitation of the colonialists. The chief of the Zanzibar Ministry of Health's pharmacy, Tarib, recalls: "Before the revolution, Zanzibar had a few British pharmacists who came here. These people only knew how to promote medicines for British capitalists and paid no attention to the wishes of the Zanzibar people to develop their own pharmaceutical industry." A friend from the Zanzibar medical community said: "In the past, because we could not produce medicines ourselves, we had to spend tens of thousands of pounds every year to buy medicines from abroad. Now that we can produce medicines ourselves, we have changed the situation of complete dependence on imported foreign medicines and shattered the colonialists' dream of forever exploiting us."

For the Health of the Zanzibar People

Chinese pharmaceutical workers, in helping the Tanzanian people build the workshop, made do with what they had and used an old building in Lenin Hospital to establish the pharmaceutical workshop. The first vice president of Tanzania, Karume, attaches great importance to and praises the work of the Chinese pharmaceutical workers, and has personally inspected the workshop several times.

Zanzibar is an island with highly alkaline groundwater. Chinese and Zanzibar pharmaceutical workers, under difficult material conditions, used this water to produce qualified injection water and successfully manufactured large-scale injections such as glucose solution and physiological saline. Initially, some doctors from European countries working in the hospital expressed doubts about these injections. To prove that their glucose solution is suitable for human injection, Chinese pharmaceutical workers, in addition to conducting biological experiments and chemical tests as required by the pharmacopoeia, also used their own bodies for the first injection test. The qualified quality of the injections and the lofty spirit of the Chinese pharmaceutical workers were praised by the entire hospital staff. After that, doctors in hospitals in Zanzibar (including Pemba Island) all used injections produced by Zanzibar.

Just as Chinese and Zanzibar pharmaceutical workers were rejoicing over the production of several types of injections, an awkward situation occurred in Lenin Hospital: the locally anesthetizing injection imported from Britain had run out, and new orders could not arrive in the short term, causing the number of patients waiting for local anesthesia surgery to pile up. The Chinese pharmaceutical workers, taking Dr. Norman Bethune as an example, in order to relieve the patients' pain as soon as possible, decided with their Zanzibar counterparts to overcome difficulties and begin trial production despite the lack of resources and incomplete raw materials. After more than twenty trials, they finally found another new stabilizer and produced injections with the same efficacy as the imported local anesthetics that could be stored for a relatively long period, allowing the hospital to resume local anesthesia surgeries early.

Zanzibar Has Its First Generation of Pharmaceutical Workers

The Zanzibar government attaches great importance to and cares for the growth of its own pharmaceutical workers. The Ministry of Health has selected six outstanding Zanzibar youth to learn from the Chinese pharmaceutical workers. These Zanzibar trainees are diligent and have made rapid progress. The first trainee, Mendava, after more than a year of study and practice, has mastered the techniques of producing distilled water, filtering, filling, sterilizing, and simple analysis and identification. Currently, she can independently produce qualified physiological saline, mannitol, and more than twenty other injections. In the past year, she alone has produced more than six thousand bottles of glucose solution.

The growth of Zanzibar's first generation of medical and pharmaceutical workers has shattered the colonialists' malicious slander that the African people are "stupid."

Long Live Chairman Mao!

Friends from Zanzibar who came to visit the workshop all expressed in unison their respect and affection for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, in enthusiastic words. They praised the lofty qualities of the Chinese overseas aid workers under Chairman Mao's guidance, who serve the Zanzibar people wholeheartedly. A group of Tanzanian Zanzibar Defense Force soldiers, after the visit, reluctantly shook hands with their Chinese friends to express their thanks and repeatedly reminded them to bring the greetings of the Zanzibar people to the great leader Chairman Mao when they return home.

One Zanzibar friend also eagerly asked the Chinese pharmaceutical workers for a piece of vitamin, intending to take it back to show his family the medicines produced by Zanzibar, so that the whole family could share in his joy. He said: "This is not just a health-aiding pill, but also a crystal of the friendship between the people of Tanzania and China. From here, we can see the selfless aid of China under Chairman Mao's leadership and the lofty internationalist spirit of the Chinese people under his guidance. There are no better words to express my gratitude. I only have one sentence: Long live Chairman Mao!"

### 友谊的结晶——记中国制药人员帮助坦桑尼亚桑给巴尔建立制药车间

    友谊的结晶
    ——记中国制药人员帮助坦桑尼亚桑给巴尔建立制药车间
    近日来，许多坦桑尼亚桑给巴尔朋友怀着十分喜悦的心情，纷纷来到桑给巴尔岛上最大的医院——列宁医院，参观在中国制药人员帮助下建立起来的制药车间。几名桑给巴尔制药学员，穿着洁白的工作服，正专心地操纵着自动旋转式压片机、电动糖衣机和电热高压灭菌器。两旁的橱柜里，陈列着一排排的药瓶，装着这个车间生产的四十多种治疗常见病的注射剂和片剂，其中有葡萄糖、四圜素、硫酸亚铁，等等。
    这些药品，经过化验符合药典要求，临床应用疗效良好；数量也已基本上能够满足桑给巴尔所有医院的需要。
      走自力更生的道路
    当许多参观者看到一瓶瓶药品上贴着“桑给巴尔卫生部监制”的标签时，无不感到兴奋和自豪。他们感谢毛主席派来的中国制药人员帮助他们在制药方面走上了自力更生的道路，同时又不禁回忆起过去完全依靠从英国进口药品时的情景。那时，不但药价昂贵，而且往往由于药品不能及时运到耽误了治疗，有的病人甚至因此丧失了生命。
    殖民主义者为了牟取暴利，把制药神秘化，垄断制药技术，企图长期剥削非洲人民。当参观的桑给巴尔朋友们把这个车间生产药品的低廉成本和从英国进口药品的高昂价格作比较时，无不谴责殖民主义者的残酷剥削。桑给巴尔卫生部药库主任塔里布回忆说：“革命前，桑给巴尔曾来过几个英国药剂师，这些人成天只知道给英国资本家推销药品，根本不理会桑给巴尔人民要求发展自己制药事业的愿望。”桑给巴尔医务界一位朋友说：“过去由于我们自己不能生产药品，每年不得不花数万英镑到外国买药。现在我们自己能生产药品，改变了完全依赖进口外国药品的状况，打破了殖民主义者企图永远剥削我们的美梦。”
    为了桑给巴尔人民的健康
    中国制药人员在帮助坦桑尼亚人民建设时，因陋就简，利用列宁医院一幢旧房子建成了制药车间。坦桑尼亚第一副总统卡鲁姆非常重视和赞赏中国制药人员的工作，曾亲自几次到这个车间视察。
    桑给巴尔是一个海岛，地下水碱性较大。中国和桑给巴尔制药人员在物质条件困难的情况下用这种水制成了合格的注射用水，同时还成功地制成了葡萄糖液、生理盐水等大型注射剂。最初，在医院工作的一些来自欧洲国家的医生对这些注射剂表示怀疑。为了证明他们生产的葡萄糖液可供人体注射，中国制药人员除按药典要求作生物实验和化学检验外，还用自己的身体作了首次注射试验。注射剂的合格质量和中国制药人员的崇高精神受到整个医院工作人员的赞扬。此后，桑给巴尔（包括奔巴岛）医院的医生都使用桑给巴尔自己生产的注射剂。
    正当中国和桑给巴尔制药人员为他们制成数种注射剂而高兴时，列宁医院发生了一件令人为难的事情：从英国进口的局部麻药注射剂用完了，新的订货短期内不能到达，医院里等待作局部麻醉手术的病人越积越多。中国制药人员以白求恩医生为榜样，为了尽早解除病人的痛苦，便同桑给巴尔制药人员一道下定决心，克服困难，在资料缺乏、原料不全的情况下开始试制。经过二十多次试验，终于找到了另一种新的稳定剂，制成了能够较长期保存的与进口局部麻醉剂具有同等效力的注射剂，使医院及早恢复了局部麻醉手术。
  桑给巴尔有了第一代制药人员
    桑给巴尔政府十分重视和关心自己制药人员的成长。卫生部先后挑选了六名优秀的桑给巴尔青年向中国制药人员学习。这些桑给巴尔学员发奋图强，刻苦学习，进步很快。最先来的学员孟达娃经过一年多的学习和实践，已经掌握了制蒸馏水、配制过滤、灌装消毒、简易的分析鉴定等技术。目前，她已能独立生产合格的生理盐水、甘露醇等二十多种注射剂。一年来，仅葡萄液一项，她就制作了六千多瓶。
    桑给巴尔第一代医务人员、制药人员的茁壮成长，粉碎了殖民主义者恶毒咒骂非洲人民“愚蠢”的谰言。
        祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    来车间参观的桑给巴尔朋友，都异口同声地用热烈的言词，表达他们对中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的尊敬和爱戴。他们赞扬毛主席教导下的中国援外人员全心全意为桑给巴尔人民服务的高尚品质。一批坦桑尼亚桑给巴尔国防军战士参观后，依依不舍地握着中国朋友的手表示感谢，并一再叮嘱他们回国后一定要把桑给巴尔人民的问候带给伟大领袖毛主席。
    一位桑给巴尔朋友还满怀激情地向中国制药人员要了一片维生素，准备带回去给家里人亲眼看看桑给巴尔生产的药品，好让全家老少共同分享他的喜悦。他说：“这不只是一片有助健康的药片，而且是坦桑尼亚—中国人民友谊的结晶。从这里我们可以看到毛主席领导下的中国的无私援助和他老人家教导下的中国人民的崇高的国际主义精神。没有更好的语言能表达我的感谢。我只有一句话：祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
