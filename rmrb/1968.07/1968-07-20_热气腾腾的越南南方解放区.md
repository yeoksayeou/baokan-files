The liberation zones in South Vietnam are bustling with energy.

	Elections for People's Governments
	The people of the liberation zones in Kim Giao Province are enthusiastically participating in the elections for the people's liberation committees at the commune and village levels, joyfully electing their representatives and establishing revolutionary governments.

	Currently, the counties of Chau Thanh, Cao Lai, Gai No, Nam Ngan, Thai Binh, Truong Giang, and Tan Nha in the liberation zones have completed their election work and established commune and village people's liberation committees. Nam Ngan County is the first county in Kim Giao Province to be completely liberated, with people's liberation committees established in all its communes and villages.

	The people in the liberation zones of My Tho Province have also held elections for the commune and village people's liberation committees. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of April, 63 communes in the province had elected and established people's governments. The people in these areas also held grand meetings to celebrate the birth of the people's government.

	Youths Eagerly Enlist in the Military
	Since the beginning of this year, tens of thousands of youths in the provinces of the Mekong Delta have eagerly enlisted in the military, taking to the front lines of the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

	In just three months, more than 4,500 youths in the province of Ben Tre have joined the people's liberation armed forces. Three hundred teachers and students from the towns of Ben Tre, My Tho, and Cao Lanh have also rushed to the liberation zones to enlist in the military.

	In the newly liberated areas of Long An Province, 3,000 peasant youths have eagerly enlisted in the military in just twenty days to fight the enemy and save the country. Some families have even had both father and son enlist. Those temporarily left in the villages have eagerly joined the guerrilla forces, rapidly expanding the guerrilla units in each commune.

	At the same time, the broad masses of young men and women in various places in the Mekong Delta have eagerly joined the youth shock brigades to support the front lines. In the counties of Chau Thanh, Long My, and Phong Hiep in Can Tho Province, more than 4,000 youths participated in support work in February and March. In the county of Phuoc Long in Long An Province, more than 500 young men and women joined the labor service corps, serving the front lines with the spirit of "everything for the front lines, everything for defeating the enemy."

	Actively Supporting the Front Lines
	To achieve victory in the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, the peasants in the liberation zones of My Tho Province are enthusiastically supporting the front lines. Recently, the peasants have launched a competition to complete the 1968 war tax grain quota, with many households even paying the 1969 war tax grain in advance. The peasants have also sent pigs, chickens, fish, and fruits to the troops to comfort the liberation army.

	The peasants in the liberation zones of Long An Province, in order to develop production and support the front lines, have dug hundreds of kilometers of irrigation canals and built hundreds of saltwater barriers this year, converting 8,000 hectares of single-crop fields into double-crop fields.

	Arts for Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
	The cultural workers in the central region of South Vietnam have implemented the policy of serving the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, going deep into various places to serve them, and achieving good results.

	The liberation cultural troupes of various ethnic groups in the Central Highlands have braved hardships, climbing mountains and crossing rivers to perform for soldiers, labor service corps, and the people in newly liberated areas. The song and dance troupe of the central region's liberation armed forces has also striven to overcome difficulties and timely created many new programs, singing the praises of the new victories of the South Vietnamese military and people in the spring. This troupe performed for 25,000 soldiers and civilians in the northern part of Quang Nam Province in more than a month.

	The cultural troupes of Quang Nam Province and the cultural teams of Duyen Hoa and Vinh Thuan Counties have braved hardships and sacrifices, performing under the fire of war in various newly liberated areas and near the city of Hue. These cultural troupes have also performed for the soldiers on the front lines.
