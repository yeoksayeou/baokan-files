The oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" is a brilliant work created by the Red Guards of Beijing schools under the radiant guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line of art and under the personal nurturing and care of Comrade Jiang Qing. "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" is a vibrant flower blooming with the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, a passionate ode to the glorious and magnificent Chairman Mao, and a fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the autumn of 1921, our great teacher Chairman Mao, dressed in a blue cotton gown and holding an umbrella, full of vigor and spirit, braved the storms of the times, traversing a long journey step by step towards Anshan! The mountains of Anshan rejoiced, the waters of Pingxi sang, and the red sun illuminated Anshan. This marked a great turning point in Anshan's history, the beginning of the awakening of more than seventeen thousand miners, and the starting point of the victory of the Anshan workers' movement.

Chairman Mao arrived in Anshan, closely linked with the masses. Chairman Mao went down into the mines, lived in workers' huts, and had heart-to-heart talks with the workers. Every word of Chairman Mao was like the thunder of spring, resonating in the hearts of the workers; like a torch in the night, illuminating the hearts of the workers; like the North Star in the night sky, guiding the Anshan workers in their struggle. The suffering workers of Anshan, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, launched a revolutionary storm that turned the world upside down.

The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" forcefully reveals a great truth: Only the great leader Chairman Mao is the savior of the Chinese people, who can lead the laboring people to the path of thorough liberation. We, the revolutionary artists forever loyal to Chairman Mao, regard it as our greatest honor and happiness to wholeheartedly praise the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

In the past, the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts, under the control of the old Propaganda Department, the old Ministry of Culture, and the old Beijing Municipal Committee, became a den of bourgeois ideology and a stronghold for creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary Red Guards and red artists emerged. They fiercely opposed the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art. They carried forward the spirit of daring to think, dare to act, dare to revolutionize, and dare to innovate, wielding their red brushes, stepping out of the school gates, and going to the workers, peasants, soldiers, streets, factories, countryside, and military units. With deep class feelings of boundless love, admiration, faith, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, they wholeheartedly sang praises to the reddest red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao.

Under the radiant guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought and tempered in the great storms of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the young red artists, under the personal leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, have made new contributions to the development of proletarian revolutionary new literature and art in our country. We will definitely continue to strive to make the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    永远忠于毛主席的革命文艺路线

    油画《毛主席去安源》是北京院校红卫兵小将，在毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线的光辉照耀下，在江青同志亲自培育和亲切关怀下创作成功的。《毛主席去安源》是一枝鲜艳夺目、闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的花朵，是热情歌颂伟大统帅毛主席光辉壮丽的诗篇，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。
    一九二一年秋天，我们伟大导师毛主席身穿一件蓝布长衫，手拿一把雨伞，神采奕奕，精神抖擞，迎着时代的急风暴雨，长途跋涉，一步一步地向安源走来了！安源山在欢呼，萍水河在歌唱，红太阳照亮了安源，这是安源历史的伟大转折，这是一万七千多路矿工人觉醒的开端，这是安源工人运动走向胜利的起点。
    毛主席来到安源，最紧密联系群众，毛主席下矿井，住工棚，和工人促膝谈心。毛主席的每句话，象春天的惊雷，在工人心窝里震响；象黑夜的火炬，把工人心坎照亮；象夜空的北斗，给安源工人指明了斗争的方向。苦难深重的安源工人，在毛主席革命路线的指引下，掀起了一场天翻地覆的革命风暴。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。油画《毛主席去安源》向我们有力地揭示了一个伟大的真理：只有伟大领袖毛主席才是中国人民的大救星，才能领导劳动人民走彻底解放的革命大道。我们永远忠于毛主席的革命文艺战士，把尽情歌颂伟大领袖毛主席、尽情歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想，当做最大的光荣，最大的幸福。
    过去，中央工艺美术学院在旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委的控制下，变成了资产阶级的大染缸，成了为资本主义复辟大造舆论的顽固堡垒。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，革命红卫兵和红色文艺战士冲杀出来了。他们大造了党内一小撮走资派的反，大造了反革命修正主义文艺黑线的反。他们发扬了敢想、敢干、敢革命、敢创新的精神，挥舞起红画笔，走出校门，到工农兵群众中去，到街头、工厂、农村、部队去。他们满怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限崇拜、无限信仰、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，尽情歌颂我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。
    在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在无产阶级文化大革命的大风大浪中锻炼成长的年青的红色文艺战士，在江青同志的亲自率领下，为发展我国无产阶级的革命新文艺作出了新的贡献。我们一定继续努力，为把中央工艺美术学院办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校而奋斗。
