Beijing Chemical Factory No. 3 Revolutionary Committee Studies Lingbao County's Experience, Determined to Further Improve the Revolutionary Nature of the Leadership Team

Break Overlapping Organizations, Implement Streamlining and Reduce Officialdom, Maintain Close Ties with the Masses

With the assistance of the PLA's support team, the factory's revolutionary committee has achieved initial success in streamlining and reducing officialdom. They have realized that reducing the levels of administrative management allows the voice of the proletarian headquarters to reach the masses more quickly and directly; the members of the revolutionary committee frequently go among the masses and participate in labor, greatly strengthening their ties with the masses; a large number of office staff and technical personnel have gone to the workshops, working and eating with the workers, learning from the masses, which is beneficial for promoting ideological revolutionization.

Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: The members of the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Chemical Factory No. 3 have seriously studied the experience of the Revolutionary Committee of Lingbao County in implementing the revolutionary nature of the leadership team, streamlining and reducing officialdom, and maintaining close ties with the masses, as well as the important editorial note from the People's Daily. They have been greatly inspired and educated. They are determined to take the Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee as an example, further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks, and walk the path of "streamlining and reducing officialdom," building the revolutionary committee into a revolutionary leadership team that is closely connected with the masses.

	Firmly Implement Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions,
	Walk the Path of "Streamlining and Reducing Officialdom"

During the study meeting, the members of this factory's revolutionary committee unanimously agreed that the Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee has high-held the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, carried forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, broke through the overlapping administrative organizations, walked the path of "streamlining and reducing officialdom," implemented the revolutionary nature of the leadership team, and set an example for the construction of revolutionary committees at all levels. The important editorial note from the People's Daily conveys the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao and the orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. It must be seriously studied and strictly followed.

The members of the Revolutionary Committee of Chemical Factory No. 3 said that implementing streamlining and reducing officialdom and maintaining close ties with the masses is a consistent teaching of the great leader Chairman Mao. As early as 1942, Chairman Mao instructed the entire party in the revolutionary base areas to implement "streamlining and reducing officialdom," which must achieve the five goals of "simplification, unification, efficiency, economy, and anti-bureaucratism." In the arduous years of revolutionary warfare, the entire party followed Chairman Mao's instructions, implemented streamlining and reducing officialdom, maintained close ties with the masses, and relied closely on the masses, achieving great victories in revolutionary struggles. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "Revolutionary committees must implement unified leadership, break through the overlapping administrative organizations, streamline and reduce officialdom, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is closely connected with the masses." Seriously implementing Chairman Mao's latest instruction, as pointed out in the editorial note of the People's Daily, is of great significance for implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, carrying out struggles against the enemy, smashing the class enemy's attempt to restore capitalism, overcoming the old habits of bureaucratism, promoting the revolutionary great alliance of the two revolutionary mass organizations, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks and streamlining and reducing officialdom, and in conjunction with these two tasks, do a good job in rectifying the party organization and strengthening party building, carry out revolutionary criticism, and further consolidate and develop the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from an organizational perspective.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee of this factory, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, they have achieved initial success in streamlining and reducing officialdom. Under the support and assistance of the support team of the People's Liberation Army's 8341 Unit, while vigorously carrying out the work of cleaning up the class ranks, they fully mobilized the revolutionary masses of the entire factory, severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev and his agents in the factory regarding the construction of political power, criticized conservatism, broke through the resistance of the old forces of the exploiting classes, and according to the actual needs of revolution and production, formed a new organization of three groups and one office (political work group, production group, administrative group, and office). The number of full-time personnel was reduced by 70% compared to before.

The members of the factory's revolutionary committee, while studying and discussing the experience of Lingbao County, reviewed their own struggle history and unanimously agreed that walking the path indicated by Chairman Mao and implementing streamlining and reducing officialdom have too many advantages. They said that reducing the levels of management allows the voice of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin to reach the masses more quickly and directly; the members of the revolutionary committee frequently go among the masses and participate in production labor, greatly strengthening their ties with the masses; a large number of office staff and technical personnel have gone to the workshops, working and eating with the workers, learning from the masses, which is beneficial for promoting ideological revolutionization; after streamlining the organization, the integration of design, experimentation, and production was realized, greatly improving work efficiency. The great changes in the factory have powerfully demonstrated the great power of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The members of the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Chemical Factory No. 3 said that although we have done some work in streamlining and reducing officialdom and have been warmly welcomed by revolutionary workers, there is still a significant gap compared to the Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee. They expressed that in the process of learning from the experience of Lingbao County, they must seriously summarize the experience of implementing streamlining and reducing officialdom in their own factory, further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and stride forward towards organizing a revolutionary leadership team that is closely connected with the masses.

	Reform Administrative Management Organizations, Implement the Revolutionary Nature of the Leadership Team, and Must Carry Out Revolutionary Criticism

The members of the Revolutionary Committee of Chemical Factory No. 3 said that the "implementing streamlining and reducing officialdom is a sharp and profound class struggle" pointed out in the editorial note of the People's Daily is completely in line with the actual situation of our factory. The process of our factory implementing streamlining and reducing officialdom is a process of sharp and profound class struggle. In March of this year, we implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions and began to streamline the organization in the factory. A small handful of class enemies, unwilling to accept their failure, spread rumors, shot dark arrows, and even attempted to sabotage the key departments of the factory to disrupt and attack the newly born revolutionary committee, sabotage the Cultural Revolution, and sabotage the work of streamlining the organization. Some revolutionary workers, due to the influence of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the construction of political power, had insufficient understanding of the importance of implementing streamlining and reducing officialdom and reforming the cumbersome and overlapping management organizations. In the discussion of organizational reform, they could not break free from the old organizational framework. Facing this situation, the factory's revolutionary committee, with the help of the supporting PLA troops stationed in the factory, mobilized the masses to launch a high tide of revolutionary criticism, launching an attack on China's Khrushchev and his agents in the factory. The revolutionary committee actively guided the revolutionary workers of the entire factory to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, combined with the serious problems of the original organization being cumbersome, personnel surplus, and detachment from the masses, starting from criticizing the fallacies of "expert management," "pursuing grandeur and foreign influence," and "the bigger the organization, the better," and the revisionist management system, severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev and his clique in the construction of political power, attempting to restore capitalism. At the criticism meeting, many cadres and technical personnel used their personal experiences to expose the harm of the old organization and the revisionist enterprise management system to the factory and themselves. Revolutionary criticism quickly raised the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of revolutionary cadres and the broad revolutionary workers, powerfully striking the sabotage activities of the class enemies. Everyone felt that the more they studied Chairman Mao's instructions, the clearer their minds became; the more they criticized China's Khrushchev's revisionist line, the more they felt that the old organization must be thoroughly reformed. Through revolutionary criticism, everyone unified their thinking, and the broad revolutionary workers took conscious action. From the offices to the workshops, everyone contributed ideas, and everyone proposed plans. Breaking free from the constraints of the old organization, breaking free from the influence of old ideas and old thoughts, bravely jumping out of the old organizational framework, and striding forward on the path of "streamlining and reducing officialdom" indicated by Chairman Mao.

The members of this factory's revolutionary committee said that revolutionary criticism is the most powerful weapon for striking the enemy and educating the masses. Criticizing deeply and thoroughly the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of China's Khrushchev and his clique in the construction of political power can quickly implement Chairman Mao's great instructions on "streamlining and reducing officialdom" and "organizing a revolutionary leadership team that is closely connected with the masses."

	The Process of Implementing Streamlining and Reducing Officialdom is Also a Process of Breaking Private Interests and Establishing Public Interests, Achieving Ideological Revolutionization

The members of the Revolutionary Committee of Chemical Factory No. 3 had a deep understanding in the study and discussion, saying that to implement Chairman Mao's great instructions on "streamlining and reducing officialdom," one must not only fight against the sabotage of class enemies and the resistance of the old forces of the exploiting classes but also fight against the "self" in one's own mind. The process of implementing "streamlining and reducing officialdom" is also a process of breaking private interests and establishing public interests, achieving ideological revolutionization for the members of the revolutionary committee, revolutionary cadres, and the broad masses of workers.

After the work of streamlining the organization began in this factory, most cadres and office personnel enthusiastically supported it and firmly demanded to go to the production front line. However, some were afraid that working in the workshops would be "unbecoming," and some were afraid of getting dirty and tired. The revolutionary committee believed that to do a good job in streamlining and reducing officialdom, achieving the ideological revolutionization of people is a very important issue. They organized the workers to study Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" again, learned from the heroic deeds of Comrade Tan Zhong, and promoted everyone to consciously criticize and repudiate private interests and establish public interests. To make the office personnel correctly understand the great significance of streamlining the organization and going to the production front line, the revolutionary committee also specially organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class, organizing cadres and technical personnel who were about to go to the production front line to study Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" and "Old Three Articles." Through the study class, they realized the profound significance of "streamlining and reducing officialdom," and everyone spoke up, summarizing the ten advantages of streamlining the organization and cadres going down to participate in labor: it is beneficial for quickly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and conveying the party's policies; it is beneficial for anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism, ensuring that the party and the state do not change color; it is beneficial for carrying out struggles against the enemy, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat; it is beneficial for the superstructure to better meet the needs of the socialist economic base; it is beneficial for narrowing the three major differences; it is beneficial for carrying out the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment; it is beneficial for overcoming bureaucratism and dogmatism; it is beneficial for transforming worldviews, achieving ideological revolutionization, and cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause; it is beneficial for promoting technological revolution and technological innovation; it is beneficial for organizing revolutionization; it is beneficial for seizing the revolution and promoting production. Through the study, everyone further established the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people, thus ensuring the smooth progress of the work of streamlining the organization.

    北京化工三厂革委会学习灵宝县经验决心进一步搞好领导班子革命化
    打破重叠机构　实行精兵简政　紧密联系群众
    在解放军支左人员的帮助下，厂革委会取得精兵简政初步成绩。他们体会到：行政管理机构层次减少，无产阶级司令部的声音能够更迅速更直接同群众见面；革委会成员经常深入群众，参加劳动，大大密切了同群众的联系；大批科室干部、技术人员下到车间，和工人同吃、同劳动，向群众学习，有利于促进思想革命化
    新华社十四日讯　北京化工三厂革命委员会的成员认真学习灵宝县革命委员会实行领导班子革命化，精兵简政，密切联系群众的经验和《人民日报》的重要编者按，受到很大的启发和教育。他们决心以灵宝县革委会为榜样，进一步落实毛主席的最新指示，做好清理阶级队伍的工作，走“精兵简政”的道路，把革命委员会建设成为革命化的联系群众的领导班子。
      坚决落实毛主席的最新指示，
        走“精兵简政”的道路
    在学习座谈会上，这个厂革委会的成员一致认为，灵宝县革委会高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，打破重叠的行政机构，走“精兵简政”的道路，实行领导班子革命化，为各级革命委员会的建设树立了样板。《人民日报》的重要编者按，传达了伟大领袖毛主席的声音，传达了以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令，一定要认真学习，坚决照办。
    化工三厂革委会成员说，实行精兵简政，密切联系群众，是伟大领袖毛主席的一贯教导。早在一九四二年，毛主席在革命根据地就指示全党要实行“精兵简政”，“必须达到精简、统一、效能、节约和反对官僚主义五项目的”。在革命战争的艰苦年代，全党遵循毛主席的教导，实行精兵简政，密切联系群众，紧紧依靠群众，取得了革命斗争的伟大胜利。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，伟大领袖毛主席又教导我们：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”认真落实毛主席的这一最新指示，正如《人民日报》编者按所指出的，对于贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，开展对敌斗争，粉碎阶级敌人复辟资本主义的企图，克服官僚主义旧习气，促进两派革命群众组织的革命大联合，巩固无产阶级专政，有着重大的意义。我们一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，搞好清理阶级队伍和精兵简政的工作，并结合这两件工作做好整顿党的组织、加强党的建设的工作，搞好革命大批判，进一步从组织上巩固和发展无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
    这个工厂的革委会成立以后，遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，在精兵简政方面做出了初步成绩。他们在人民解放军八三四一部队支左人员的支持和帮助下，在狠抓清理阶级队伍工作的同时，充分发动全厂革命群众，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本厂代理人在政权建设方面的反革命修正主义路线，批判了保守主义，冲破了剥削阶级旧势力的抵抗，根据革命和生产的实际需要，组成了三组一室（政工组、生产组、行政组和办公室）的新机构，脱产人员比原来减少百分之七十。
    工厂革委会成员在学习座谈灵宝县经验的时候，回顾了自己的斗争经历，一致认为走毛主席指引的道路，实行精兵简政，好处实在太多了。他们说，管理机构层次减少，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的声音，能够更迅速、更直接地同群众见面；革委会成员经常深入群众，参加生产劳动，大大密切了同群众的联系；大批科室干部、技术人员下到车间，和工人同吃、同劳动，向群众学习，有利于促进思想革命化；机构精简后，实现了设计、试验、生产三结合，大大提高了工作效率。工厂的这些巨大变化，有力地显示了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大力量。
    北京化工三厂革委会的成员们说，我们在精兵简政方面虽然做了一些工作，并且受到了革命职工的热烈欢迎，但同灵宝县革委会相比，还有不小差距。他们表示在学习灵宝县经验的过程中，一定要认真总结本厂实行精兵简政的经验，进一步落实毛主席的最新指示，朝着组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子阔步前进。
    改革行政管理机构，实行领导班子
      革命化，必须狠抓革命大批判
    化工三厂革命委员会的成员们说，《人民日报》编者按指出的“实行精兵简政，是一场尖锐的、深刻的阶级斗争”，完全符合我们厂的实际情况。我们厂实行精兵简政的过程，就是一场尖锐的、深刻的阶级斗争的过程。今年三月，我们落实毛主席的最新指示，在厂里开始实行精简机构时，一小撮阶级敌人不甘心于自己的失败，他们造谣言，放暗箭，还妄图破坏工厂的要害部门，来干扰和冲击新生的革命委员会，破坏文化大革命，破坏精简机构的工作。有些革命职工由于受到中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面的反革命修正主义路线的影响，对实行精兵简政，改革庞杂、重叠的管理机构的重要性认识不足，在讨论改革机构时，跳不出原来旧机构的圈子。针对这种情况，厂革委会在驻厂解放军支左人员的帮助下，放手发动群众，掀起了革命大批判高潮，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本厂代理人发起进攻。革委会积极引导全厂革命职工用战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，结合本厂原来机构庞杂、人浮于事、脱离群众等严重现象，从批判“专家治厂”，“贪大求洋”，“摊子越大越好”等谬论和修正主义管理制度入手，大批大揭中国赫鲁晓夫一伙在政权建设方面推行反革命修正主义路线，妄图复辟资本主义的罪行。在批判会上，许多干部和技术人员以自己的切身经历揭露了旧机构和修正主义的企业管理制度对工厂和自己的危害。革命的大批判，迅速提高了革命干部和广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，有力地打击了阶级敌人的破坏活动。大家感到，越学毛主席的指示，心里越明亮；越批中国赫鲁晓夫推行的修正主义路线，就越感到旧的机构必须彻底改革。通过革命的大批判，大家统一了认识，广大革命职工自觉地行动起来，从科室到车间，人人出主意，个个提方案。冲破旧机构的束缚，冲破旧观念、旧思想的影响，勇敢地跳出了旧机构的圈子，朝着毛主席指引的“精兵简政”的道路前进了一大步。
    这个厂革委会的成员们说，革命的大批判是打击敌人、教育群众的最有力武器。批深批臭中国赫鲁晓夫一伙在政权建设方面的反革命修正主义谬论，就能迅速落实毛主席关于“精兵简政”、“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的伟大指示。
    实行精兵简政的过程，也是破私立公，
        实现思想革命化的过程
    化工三厂革委会成员在学习座谈中深有体会地说，要贯彻执行毛主席关于“精兵简政”的伟大指示，不仅要同阶级敌人的破坏和剥削阶级旧势力的抵抗斗，而且要同自己头脑中的“私”字斗。实行“精兵简政”的过程，也是革委会成员、革命干部和广大职工破私立公、实现思想革命化的过程。
    这个厂精简机构的工作开始以后，大多数干部和科室人员热烈拥护，坚决要求到生产第一线去。但也有人怕下车间劳动“面子”不好看，有的怕脏怕累。厂革委会认为，要搞好精兵简政，实现人的思想革命化是一个十分重要的问题。他们针对职工中的活思想，组织职工再一次学习了毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”，学习了门合同志的英雄事迹，促使大家自觉地斗私批修，破私立公。为了使科室人员正确认识精简机构和走向生产第一线的重大意义，革委会还专门举办了毛泽东思想学习班，组织准备走上生产第一线的干部和技术人员学习毛主席的“五·七”指示和“老三篇”。经过学习班的学习，他们认识到“精兵简政”的深远意义，大家你一言我一语，总结出了精简机构、干部下放参加劳动的十大好处：有利于迅速落实毛主席的最新指示和传达党的方针政策；有利于反修防修，保证党和国家不变颜色；有利于开展对敌斗争，巩固无产阶级专政；有利于上层建筑更加适合社会主义经济基础的需要；有利于缩小三大差别；有利于开展阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三项伟大革命运动；有利于克服官僚主义和教条主义；有利于改造世界观、实现思想革命化，培养无产阶级革命事业接班人；有利于大搞技术革命和技术革新；有利于组织革命化；有利于抓革命，促生产。通过学习，大家进一步树立起了全心全意为人民服务的思想，因而保证了精简机构工作的顺利进行。
