	Humphrey, in the U.S. presidential election farce, is facing universal opposition everywhere he goes. In Los Angeles' Watts district, black residents booed and jeered, driving Humphrey away.

	Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: Washington - U.S. Vice President Humphrey, in an attempt to secure the presidency in this year's U.S. presidential election farce, has recently been conducting extensive campaign activities across the United States. However, wherever he goes, he is met with opposition, much like a rat crossing the street, drawing shouts of condemnation from all sides. Following his encounter with over a thousand young students in New York City on the 23rd, Humphrey has continued to face angry reproaches from demonstrators in various locations.

	On the evening of the 27th, Humphrey visited the Watts district, a predominantly black neighborhood in Los Angeles, attempting to win black support with empty rhetoric. However, the residents of Watts, with their rich experience in anti-violence struggles, paid no heed to Humphrey's tactics. They booed and jeered, preventing him from continuing his speech, forcing him to retreat under the protection of his bodyguards. As he left the venue, the black crowd shouted slogans such as "White racist, go back!" and "You fascist!" Earlier that day, when Humphrey arrived at Los Angeles Airport, many demonstrators were already protesting against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam.

	On the evening of the 26th, when Humphrey arrived in Salt Lake City, Utah, for campaign activities, large crowds took to the streets in protest against the U.S. war in Vietnam and the ongoing presidential election farce. The demonstrators' placards labeled Humphrey a "political clown" and condemned him as a "war criminal with blood on his hands."

    老鼠过街人人喊打
    汉弗莱在美国总统竞选丑剧中到处碰壁
    洛杉矶瓦茨区黑人连嘘带骂轰走汉弗莱
    新华社二十八日讯　华盛顿消息：美国副总统汉弗莱为了在今年美国总统选举丑剧中竞选当总统，最近到美国各地大肆进行竞选活动，但是他所到之处，就象一只过街老鼠，人人喊打。继二十三日在纽约市中心遭到一千多名青年学生的围攻之后，汉弗莱连日来又不断遭到各地示威群众的愤怒痛斥。
    二十七日晚上，汉弗莱到洛杉矶的黑人居住区瓦茨区发表演说，妄图用一些花言巧语来骗取黑人的支持。但是，有着丰富的抗暴斗争经验的瓦茨区黑人，根本不理汉弗莱的那一套，他们连嘘带骂使汉弗莱无法讲下去，只好在保镖的保护下狼狈溜走。在他退出会场的时候，黑人群众还高喊“白人种族主义者滚回去”、“你这个法西斯”等口号。二十七日白天，当汉弗莱到达洛杉矶机场的时候，就有许多群众举行反对美帝国主义侵略越南的示威。
    二十六日晚上，汉弗莱到达犹他州盐湖城进行竞选活动时，大批群众举行游行示威，抗议美国侵越战争和正在上演的美国总统选举丑剧。示威者拿着的标语牌上把汉弗莱称作“政治小丑”，谴责他是“两手沾满鲜血”的战犯。
