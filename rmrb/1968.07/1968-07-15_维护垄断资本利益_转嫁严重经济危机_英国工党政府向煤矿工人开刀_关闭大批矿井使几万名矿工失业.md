The British Labour Government, in order to protect the interests of monopoly capital, is shifting the economic crisis onto the British people. It is accelerating the reduction of the coal industry, closing numerous mines, and laying off workers, pushing British coal miners into a desperate situation.

According to reports from British bourgeois newspapers, in the ten weeks since April of this year, the number of coal miners who have been laid off as surplus labor has reached 5,400, which is 6.5 times the number for the same period last year. Currently, 1,500 coal miners are being laid off every week. It is estimated that this year, 75,000 coal miners will be laid off, exceeding the official British plan by 35,000.

The coal industry has been one of Britain's important industrial sectors for over a hundred years. However, due to competition from oil, natural gas, and nuclear power, Britain's coal industry is increasingly declining. In 1947, when the coal industry was supposedly "nationalized," Britain had approximately 1,000 mines. By last year, this number had been reduced to just over 400. The number of miners also decreased from over 700,000 to fewer than 400,000. In November of last year, the Labour Government's Department of Power issued a "white paper" on fuel policy, announcing that Britain's coal production would be reduced from 174 million tons in 1966 to 120 million tons by 1975. This means that an average of 35,000 miners will lose their jobs each year, with older miners being permanently excluded from the labor market and not being given work.

According to reports, from April 1967 to March 1968 (the British fuel year), Britain closed 51 coal mines, resulting in 24,000 miners losing their jobs, with more than half of them being permanently excluded from the labor market. This year, the Labour Government decided to close 70 to 75 more coal mines by March 1969, laying off 47,000 workers. However, due to the increasingly severe problem of coal overproduction, the Labour Government has taken measures to accelerate the laying off of workers.

    维护垄断资本利益　转嫁严重经济危机
    英国工党政府向煤矿工人开刀
    关闭大批矿井使几万名矿工失业
    本报讯 英国工党政府为了维护垄断资本的利益，向英国人民转嫁经济危机，正在加速砍削煤炭工业，大批关闭矿井，解雇工人，使英国煤矿工人陷入了绝境。
    据英国资产阶级报刊报道，从今年四月份以来的十个星期中，被作为不再给予工作的多余人员解雇的煤矿工人达到了五千四百多人，为去年同期的六倍半。目前煤矿工人每星期被解雇一千五百人。预计今年被解雇的煤矿工人将达到七万五千人，超过英国官方计划数字三万五千人一倍以上。
    煤炭工业是一百多年来英国的重要工业部门之一。但是由于石油、天然气、核动力的竞争，英国的煤炭工业日益衰落。一九四七年实行煤炭工业所谓“国有化”的时候，英国约有一千个矿井，到去年只剩下了四百多个。矿工人数也从七十多万人减少到不到四十万人。去年十一月，工党政府动力部发表了一个关于燃料政策的“白皮书”，宣布英国煤炭工业的产量，到一九七五年将从一九六六年的一亿七千四百多万吨削减到一亿二千万吨，平均每年将有三万五千名矿工失业，其中年龄较大的矿工将作为多余人员被永远排除劳动力市场，不再给予工作。
    据报道，从一九六七年四月到一九六八年三月（英国燃料年度），英国关闭了五十一个煤炭矿井，矿工二万四千人失业，其中一半以上被永远排除出劳动力市场。今年工党政府决定到一九六九年三月再关闭七十个到七十五个煤矿，解雇工人四万七千名。但是，由于煤炭生产过剩的问题越来越严重，工党政府就采取了加紧解雇工人的措施。
