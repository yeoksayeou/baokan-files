The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Peru Hails Chairman Mao's Statement Supporting the Struggle of American Blacks Against Violence as a Brilliant Document

Mao Zedong Thought Advances the World Revolution to a New Era of Victory

Calls on All Party Members to Study and Apply Mao Zedong Thought in Light of Peru's Revolutionary Situation

	BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) — LIMA — The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Peru issued a statement in May this year, enthusiastically hailing Chairman Mao Zedong's statement on April 16 supporting the struggle of American Blacks against violence. The statement also emphasized that Chairman Mao's declaration has pointed out the path to victory for all oppressed peoples of the world. The statement called on all party members to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in light of Peru's revolutionary situation.

	The statement of the Communist Party of Peru said, "Chairman Mao Zedong's statement supporting the struggle of American Blacks against violence 'points out a brilliant and radiant revolutionary direction, striking at the heart of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Peru enthusiastically hails this statement. This statement has the true programmatic content of guiding the revolutionary struggles of oppressed nations and peoples around the world, and at the same time, it demonstrates the powerful force of the Chinese people, who are vigorously carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the banner of contemporary Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought has advanced the world revolution to a new era of victory.'"

	The statement said, "Chairman Mao Zedong's statement is a brilliant document of Marxism-Leninism. It is a great encouragement to the struggle of American Blacks. American Blacks, through their own experiences, have proven that the peaceful path to opposing evil rulers is ineffective. This statement has made a historic contribution by pointing out the class nature of the detestable racial discrimination in the United States and by pointing out that the struggle of the black race, which suffers the most brutal exploitation and oppression, should be combined with the struggle of the American working people who also suffer under the rule of American monopoly capital."

	The statement said, "The historic contribution of Chairman Mao Zedong's statement is not only that it points out the path to victory for American Blacks who are fighting against U.S. imperialism, but also that it points out the path to victory for all oppressed peoples and nations of the world. It has brought to the agenda the problem of applying this universal law, that is, the necessity of using revolutionary violence as the sole means to smash the counter-revolutionary violence of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, including the modern revisionists who serve it faithfully."

	The statement went on to say, "Chairman Mao Zedong's statement briefly and accurately exposes the true face of U.S. imperialism, pointing out that U.S. imperialism is suffering from increasingly worsening and incurable political and economic crises as well as fatal blows from internal and external contradictions. 'More and more revolutionaries in the world understand that U.S. imperialism is indeed a paper tiger that will be burned to death by the flames of world revolution.'"

	In discussing the special significance of Chairman Mao Zedong's statement for the current Peruvian revolution, the statement pointed out, "Peru is a semi-feudal, semi-colonial country. There still exists racial discrimination within the country, and the so-called 'uncivilized tribes' are subjected to slave-like oppression and exploitation. When these minorities rise up in rebellion, they immediately face the true genocidal massacres of the ruling class and the state repression machine controlled by U.S. imperialism. Similarly, the indigenous people, who make up about 50% of Peru's population and are basically peasants, not only suffer from the exploitation and oppression of domestic and foreign landlords, with their land seized, living in misery, but also suffer from various forms of racial discrimination. In Peru, the entire peasant class makes up more than 65% of the population, which is the main force of the revolution. The peasant class, together with its leading force, the working class, and all laboring people, constitute the vast majority of Peru's population, an invincible force that will ultimately eliminate U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in Peru—the large landlords and comprador bourgeoisie."

	The statement concluded, "Comrade Mao Zedong's statement once again teaches us Peruvian revolutionaries that only through revolutionary violence, through the people's war of national liberation, can our laboring people, including the oppressed nationalities, free themselves from the rule of imperialism and its lackeys. Therefore, it is the duty of all party members to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in light of our country's revolutionary situation, especially the new instructions given by Comrade Mao Zedong in his statement supporting the struggle of American Blacks. Mao Zedong Thought, including his new instructions, is not only the wealth of party members but also the wealth of our oppressed and exploited laboring people. Therefore, it is our duty to spread Mao Zedong Thought among the people, to defend Mao Zedong Thought against the attacks and distortions of various domestic and foreign reactionaries, and to let Mao Zedong Thought take root in the minds of millions of the oppressed, igniting the flames of the people's war led by our party that cannot be extinguished."

    秘共中央政治委员会欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争声明是光辉的文献
    毛泽东思想把世界革命推进到一个新的胜利时代
    号召全体党员结合秘鲁革命具体情况学习和运用毛泽东思想
    新华社二十七日讯　利马消息：秘鲁共产党中央委员会政治委员会在今年五月间发表了一项声明，热烈欢呼毛泽东主席在今年四月十六日发表的支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，同时强调指出，毛主席的这一声明为全世界被压迫人民指出了胜利的道路。声明还号召全体党员，结合秘鲁革命的具体情况来学习和运用毛泽东思想。
    秘鲁共产党的声明说，毛泽东主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，“指出了光辉灿烂的革命方向，击中了美帝国主义及其走狗的要害。秘鲁共产党中央委员会政治委员会热烈欢呼这一声明。这一声明具有指导世界被压迫国家和人民的革命斗争的真正纲领性的内容，同时也显示出，在当代马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想旗帜下，正在胜利开展无产阶级文化大革命的、战斗的中国人民的强大力量。毛泽东思想已把世界革命推进到一个新的胜利的时代。”
    声明说，毛泽东主席的声明“是一篇光辉的马克思列宁主义的文献，它对美国黑人的斗争是一个新的巨大的鼓舞。美国黑人以自己的切身经验证明，用和平道路来反对罪恶的统治者是毫无成效的。这一声明作出了历史功勋，它指出了美国可憎的种族歧视的阶级性，还指出了，遭受最残忍剥削和压迫的黑色人种的斗争，应该跟同样遭受美国垄断资产阶级统治的美国劳动人民的斗争结合起来。”
    声明说，毛泽东主席的声明的历史功绩，“不仅仅在于它给正在同美帝国主义开展斗争的美国黑人指出了胜利的道路，而且也给全世界被压迫人民和国家指出了胜利的道路。它把运用这样一个普遍规律的问题提到日程上来了，那就是必须要用革命的暴力作为粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗，包括为它忠实效劳的现代修正主义分子的反革命暴力的唯一手段。”
    声明接着说，毛泽东主席的声明简短而准确地揭露了美帝国主义的真面目，指出美帝国主义正遭受到日益恶化和不可救药的政治和经济危机以及国内外重重矛盾的致命打击。“世界上越来越多的革命者懂得，美帝国主义的确是一只纸老虎，必将被世界革命烈火烧死。”
    声明在谈到毛泽东主席的声明对当前秘鲁革命有着特别重大的意义时指出，秘鲁是一个半封建、半殖民地性质的国家。国内还存在着种族歧视，对被蔑称为“不开化部落”的少数民族进行奴隶般的压迫和剥削。当这些少数民族起来反抗时，他们就立即遭到统治阶级和美帝国主义操纵的国家镇压机器的真正灭绝种族的大屠杀。同样，占秘鲁人口百分之五十的基本上都是农民的印第安人，不仅遭受国内外大庄园主的剥削和压迫，土地被霸占，生活在水深火热之中，而且也遭受多种的种族歧视。在秘鲁，整个农民阶级占人口的百分之六十五多，这是革命的主力军。农民阶级与它的领导力量工人阶级以及全体劳动人民构成了秘鲁人口的绝大多数，这是一支不可战胜的力量，最终必将消灭美帝国主义及其在秘鲁的走狗——大庄园主和买办资产阶级。
    声明最后说：“毛泽东同志的声明再次教导我们秘鲁革命者，只有用革命的暴力，用民族解放的革命人民战争，我们劳动人民，其中包括被压迫民族，才能摆脱帝国主义及其走狗的统治。因此，结合我国革命的具体情况，学习和运用毛泽东思想，特别是毛泽东同志在支持美国黑人斗争的声明中所作的新的指示，是我党全体党员的义务。毛泽东思想，包括他的一些新的指示，不仅仅是党员的财富，而且是我们被压迫、被剥削的劳动人民的财富。因此，在人民群众中传播毛泽东思想，在形形色色的国内外反动派攻击和歪曲中捍卫毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想在百万被剥削者的头脑中扎根，点燃起由我们党领导的革命人民战争不可扑灭的火焰，这是我们革命者的义务。”
