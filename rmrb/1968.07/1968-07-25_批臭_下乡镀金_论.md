Title: Refuting the "Down to the Countryside for Gold Plating" Theory

After graduating from high school in 1964, I responded to Chairman Mao's great call for "all young students and intellectuals to unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants" and volunteered to settle down in the countryside. At that time, someone instilled in me the "down to the countryside for gold plating" theory of China's Khrushchev, saying, "If you work hard in the countryside for a few years, you will be allowed to return to the city." Under the poisonous influence of this fallacy, although I worked hard in the countryside, I always had a little calculator with a "selfish" mindset. In 1965, the poor and lower-middle peasants elected me as a cadre, but I was afraid of being "tied" to the countryside and did not dare to take on the responsibility. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, "This child has come down, but his heart has not come down." I took this problem seriously and studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao taught us, "We Communists are like seeds, and the people are like the land. When we go to a place, we must unite with the people there and take root, blossom, and bear fruit among the people." The poor and lower-middle peasants also educated me on class struggle, reminding me to never forget the past and never forget class struggle. Chairman Mao's teachings and the care of the poor and lower-middle peasants helped me recognize the reactionary nature of the "down to the countryside for gold plating" theory.

According to China's Khrushchev's teachings, intellectual youth go to the countryside only to "gold plate" themselves, deceiving the masses to gain trust and high positions and wealth. Temporarily being a farmer is to ensure they will never be a farmer; temporarily leaving the city is to ensure they will never leave the city. China's Khrushchev thus obstructs and sabotages the unity of intellectual youth with workers and peasants, attempting to lead them down the capitalist path to serve his restoration of capitalism. We will not fall for his tricks!

Following Chairman Mao's teachings to serve the people wholeheartedly, I actively participated in the three great revolutionary movements, tempering my loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of class enemies incited down-to-the-countryside youth to return to the city to "rebel." I, along with other down-to-the-countryside youth, firmly opposed them and resisted the trend of returning to the city to "rebel." Together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, we intensified the struggle against the enemy and actively carried out revolutionary criticism. This greatly promoted the revolutionization of people's thoughts and drove the leapfrog development of production. The original plan to complete the wheat harvest in seven days was completed two and a half days ahead of schedule with high quality.

In the production struggle, I humbly learned from the poor and lower-middle peasants, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, contributing my strength to the construction of a new socialist countryside. Once, during labor, I accidentally cut my hand with a wound over an inch long. However, thinking it was the busy season, I endured the pain and continued to work. This spring, while spreading manure, I saw that the water gate of the reservoir was open, and no matter how many times I closed it, it would not stay shut. So, I took off my clothes, jumped into the water, and closed the gate. When I came out, my whole body was frozen purple. But thinking that the water would not be wasted and could irrigate more wheat, I felt warm at heart.

After more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants elected me to participate in the brigade and commune revolutionary committees. I firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "being both an official and a common person," resolutely criticizing China's Khrushchev's "down to the countryside for gold plating" theory, fighting against every selfish thought, striving to ensure that although my position has changed, my style of connecting with the masses cannot change, my ordinary laborer's nature cannot change, and my participation in production labor cannot change.

We youth from the cities came to the countryside not for "gold plating," but for revolution. I will sincerely listen to Chairman Mao's words, sincerely regard the poor and lower-middle peasants as my teachers, fight against selfishness and revisionism, establish a proletarian worldview, and walk the path of uniting with workers and peasants for life!

    批臭“下乡镀金”论
    山东省栖霞县杨础公社邢家庄大队下乡知识青年　司继义
    一九六四年我高中毕业后，响应毛主席“全国知识青年和学生青年
  一定要和广大的工农群众结合在一块”的伟大号召，报名到农村安家落户。当时，有人向我灌输中国赫鲁晓夫的“下乡镀金”论，说什么：“你到农村好好干几年，干好了，还是会让你回来的。”在这种谬论的毒害下，我下乡后虽然干活也很卖力，却总揣着一个“私”字的小算盘。一九六五年，贫下中农选我当干部，我却怕被“拴”在农村，不敢承担。贫下中农说：“这孩子下来了，心却没下来。”我带着这个问题认真地学习了毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人好比种子，人民好比土地。我们到了一个地方，就要同那里的人民结合起来，在人民中间生根、开花。”贫下中农又给我进行阶级教育，要我念念不忘过去，念念不忘阶级斗争。毛主席的教导，贫下中农的关怀，使我认识到“下乡镀金”论的反动实质。
    按照中国赫鲁晓夫的说教，知识青年下乡为的只是“镀镀金”，骗得群众的信任，捞取高官厚禄。暂时当农民，是为了永远不当农民；暂时离开城市，是为了永远不离开城市。中国赫鲁晓夫就是这样地阻挠和破坏知识青年同工农群众相结合，妄图把知识青年拉上资本主义的邪路，好为他复辟资本主义效劳。我们决不上他的当！
    我遵照毛主席的完全彻底地为人民服务的教导，积极投入三大革命运动，锤炼自己对伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心。无产阶级文化大革命中，一小撮阶级敌人煽动下乡知识青年回城“造反”。我和其他下乡知识青年同他们进行坚决斗争，顶住了这股回城“造反”的歪风。我们同广大贫下中农一起，狠抓对敌斗争，积极开展革命的大批判。这就大大地促进了人的思想革命化，带动了生产的飞跃发展。原计划七天完成麦收任务，提前两天半就高质量地完成了。
    我在生产斗争中，虚心向贫下中农学习，不怕苦，不怕累，为建设社会主义新农村贡献自己的力量。有一次，我在劳动中不小心把手碰了一条一寸多长的口子。但是，我想到当时正是大忙季节，就忍着痛坚持干活。今年春天，我在推粪时看到水库的闸门开了，关了几次也关不住，我就脱掉衣服，跳进水去关好闸门。上来时，我浑身冻得发紫。但是，我想到水不再流失，可以多浇一些小麦，心里就感到热呼呼的。
    经过两年多的无产阶级文化大革命，贫下中农选我参加了大队和公社革委会。我牢记毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的伟大教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“下乡镀金”论，狠斗“私”字一闪念，努力做到地位变了，联系群众的作风不能变，普通劳动者的本色不能变，参加生产劳动不能变。
    我们知识青年从城市来到农村，不是为了“镀金”，而是为了革命。我坚决老老实实地听毛主席的话，诚诚恳恳地拜贫下中农为师，斗私批修，树立无产阶级世界观，走一辈子同工农群众相结合的道路！
