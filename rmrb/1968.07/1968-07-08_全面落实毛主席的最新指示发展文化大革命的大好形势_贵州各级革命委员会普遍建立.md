In accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, revolutionary committees have been established throughout all prefectures, autonomous regions, counties, factories, enterprises, schools, and people's communes in Guizhou Province, achieving a red tide across the entire province. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The ship of revolution relies on the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. From the day they were established, revolutionary committees at all levels in Guizhou have placed the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work, ensuring that Mao Zedong Thought guides all work. Following Chairman Mao's instruction to "hold study classes, which is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," revolutionary committees at all levels have organized and conducted Mao Zedong Thought study classes extensively. The entire province has held over ten thousand study classes of various types, with more than one-third of the revolutionary people participating. In these classes, they have carried forward Chairman Mao's revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice, actively implementing Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, conducting revolutionary criticism, and carrying out self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, pushing the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to new heights.

Due to the unprecedented spread of Mao Zedong Thought and the deepening of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination have been further consolidated and developed across the province. The proletarian consciousness and awareness of class struggle among the people have greatly increased. Revolutionary and productive achievements have been made across the province.

Recently, Chairman Mao profoundly pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary people under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, revolutionary committees at all levels in Guizhou Province have led the revolutionary masses in conducting extensive and sustained revolutionary criticism, resolutely opposing right opportunism, rightist splittism, and rightist capitulationism, and launching a fierce offensive against a handful of class enemies. The revolutionary criticism has been unstoppable, severely striking down the counter-revolutionary winds of restoration and unearthing a group of stubborn revisionists and hidden traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries. Currently, the revolutionary criticism is deepening step by step, and the fierce offensive against a handful of class enemies is developing.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative structures, streamline administration, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." In the course of struggle, revolutionary committees at all levels in Guizhou Province have realized that to build revolutionary committees into revolutionary leadership teams that are connected with the masses, the most fundamental thing is to be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and to resolutely implement all battle commands from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Only in this way can they represent the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people and always be connected with the people heart to heart. Revolutionary committees at all levels have used Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, vigorously promoting the ideological revolutionization of the leadership team. Some regions' revolutionary committees, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "streamline administration," have significantly reduced the number of administrative bodies and personnel in the revolutionary committees, achieving a small organization, fewer personnel, and high efficiency. Many places have implemented streamlining administration, which, by reducing layers, has been more conducive to the revolutionary committees strengthening their connection with the masses and promoting the ideological revolutionization of the revolutionary committee personnel. Revolutionary committees at all levels have inherited and carried forward the Party's style of closely connecting with the masses, conducting in-depth investigations and research, and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's mass line of "concentrating from the masses and persisting among the masses." Many places' revolutionary committees, by trusting the masses, relying on the masses, and respecting the masses' pioneering spirit, have fully mobilized the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people, and accurately and resolutely struck down a handful of class enemies.

All revolutionary committees at all levels in the province are determined to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, further closely connect with the masses, and in the great storms of class struggle, build revolutionary committees into revolutionary, authoritative, and vigorous battle command centers of the proletariat.

    全面落实毛主席的最新指示发展文化大革命的大好形势
    贵州各级革命委员会普遍建立
    各级革委会大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，深入持久地开展革命大批判，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。在阶级斗争风浪中，不断巩固和发展革委会
    新华社贵阳七日电　在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，贵州省所有专区、自治州、县以及工厂、企业、学校、人民公社等基层单位，普遍建立了革命委员会，全省实现了一片红。这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。贵州各级革命委员会从建立的一天起，就把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，在一切工作中坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅。各级革委会遵循毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班。全省已举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班十万多个，三分之一以上的革命人民参加了学习。他们在学习班里，发扬毛主席亲自倡导的“理论和实践相结合”的革命学风，积极落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，开展革命的大批判，进行斗私批修，把全省活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动推向了新的高潮。
    由于毛泽东思想空前大普及，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线空前深入人心，全省革命大联合和革命三结合日益得到巩固和发展，人民群众的无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高。全省革命和生产都取得了新的胜利。
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”在毛主席最新指示的指引下，贵州省各级革委会领导广大革命群众深入持久地开展革命大批判，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，主动向一小撮阶级敌人展开了猛烈进攻。革命的大批判所向披靡，狠狠打击了阶级敌人刮起的翻案妖风，挖出了一批顽固不化的走资派和暗藏的叛徒、特务及其他反革命分子。目前，全省革命大批判正在步步深入，向一小撮阶级敌人的猛烈进攻正在深入发展。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”贵州省各级革委会在斗争实践中体会到，要把革命委员会建设成为革命化的联系群众的领导班子，最根本的是忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的一切战斗号令。只有这样，才能代表广大人民群众的根本利益，永远和人民群众心连心。各级革命委员会用毛泽东思想挂帅，狠抓领导班子的思想革命化，有的地区的革命委员会遵照毛主席“精兵简政”的教导，大大精简革委会的办事机构，大大减少工作人员，做到了机构小，人员少，办事效率高。许多地方的革命委员会实行精兵简政以后，由于减少了层次，更有利于革命委员会加强和群众的联系，更有利于促进革命委员会工作人员的思想革命化。各级革委会继承和发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风，深入实际，深入群众，大兴调查研究之风，坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的“从群众中集中起来又到群众中坚持下去”的群众路线。许多地方的革命委员会由于相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，充分发挥了人民群众的革命积极性，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    全省各级革命委员会决心遵照毛主席的教导，进一步紧密联系群众，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，把革命委员会建设成为革命的、有无产阶级权威的、朝气蓬勃的战斗指挥部。
