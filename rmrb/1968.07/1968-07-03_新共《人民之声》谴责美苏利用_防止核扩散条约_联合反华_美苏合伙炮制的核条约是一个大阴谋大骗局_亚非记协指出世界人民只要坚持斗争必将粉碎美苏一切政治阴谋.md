The New Zealand Communist Party's organ "Voice of the People" weekly recently published an article titled "The U.S.-Soviet Nuclear Treaty is a Dirty Trick." The article strongly condemns the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists for jointly concocting the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty" as a big plot and a big trick.

The article states: "The treaty between the U.S. and the Soviet Union is a trick. It uses the terror of nuclear war to intimidate the people, with the aim of allowing the U.S. and the Soviet Union to maintain their nuclear monopoly."

The article says, if the U.S. and the Soviet Union truly intend to prevent the danger of a possible nuclear war, they should destroy all existing nuclear equipment and stop producing nuclear weapons.

The article condemns the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists for using this treaty to jointly oppose China. The article says, this treaty is "a part of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists' anti-China movement. They not only want to use this treaty to incite anti-China sentiment internationally, but also use the 'nuclear umbrella' provided to countries like India, which are neighboring China, to tighten the encirclement against China."

After quoting Chairman Mao's words, "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history," the article points out: "The people will never be slaves to the atom bomb. They will seize the atom bomb. Just as the people can make the atom bomb, they will destroy it. At the same time, the people will also destroy those traitors and nuclear blackmailers who threaten them."

The New China News Agency reported on the 2nd that the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association issued a statement on the 1st, exposing the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty" adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on June 12 as another trick.

The statement points out that this treaty further exposes the close collusion between U.S. and British imperialism and the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, attempting to suppress the surging revolutionary movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the world.

The statement says that this treaty cannot prevent the initiating countries, the U.S., the Soviet Union, and Britain, from carrying out the "vertical proliferation" of such weapons. It fundamentally cannot limit their production, storage, or even use of such weapons in war. It does not include a provision guaranteeing that the initiating countries will not be the first to use such weapons.

The statement condemns that this treaty essentially deprives other signatory countries of the right to develop their own nuclear forces and produce nuclear weapons for self-defense. On the other hand, the treaty allows U.S. imperialism to further strengthen its nuclear weapons at home and abroad. The statement says that U.S. and British imperialism and Soviet revisionists guarantee "assistance" to non-nuclear signatory countries threatened by nuclear attacks, which is equivalent to declaring these non-nuclear signatory countries as their protectorates.

The statement points out that the treaty not only attempts to establish political and military hegemony between U.S. and British imperialism and the Soviet revisionist rulers over the "protectorates," but more importantly, it aims to jointly deal with China. China has shattered the U.S.-Soviet nuclear monopoly, thereby advancing the anti-imperialist struggle for national liberation of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The statement concludes, "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." Through resolute struggle, the people will defeat the various plots and tricks of the so-called big power politics led by the United States and their accomplices, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique.

    新共《人民之声》谴责美苏利用“防止核扩散条约”联合反华
    美苏合伙炮制的核条约是一个大阴谋大骗局
    亚非记协指出世界人民只要坚持斗争必将粉碎美苏一切政治阴谋
    新华社二日讯　新西兰共产党机关报《人民之声》周报最近发表题为《美苏核条约是一个肮脏的骗局》的文章，强烈谴责美帝和苏修合伙炮制所谓“防止核扩散条约”的大阴谋、大骗局。
    文章说：“美苏的这个条约是一个骗局，它用核战争的恐怖来威吓人民，目的就是为了让美苏保持核垄断。”
    文章说，如果美苏真的有诚意要防止可能爆发核战争的危险的话，他们就应该销毁一切现有的核装备，停止生产核武器。
    文章谴责美帝、苏修利用这个条约联合反华。文章说，这个条约是“美帝苏修反华运动的一个组成部分。它们不仅想通过这个条约，在国际上煽动反华情绪，而且利用对印度等邻近中国的国家提供‘核保护伞’，来加紧拼凑反华包围圈。”
    文章在援引了毛主席的“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”这段语录后指出：“人民决不会做原子弹的奴隶，他们必将掌握原子弹。就象人民能制造原子弹一样，他们将要消灭它。同时，人民也能消灭威胁他们的那些叛徒和核讹诈者。”
    新华社二日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会书记处一日发表声明，揭露六月十二日联合国大会通过的所谓“防止核武器扩散条约”是又一个骗局。
    声明指出，这个条约进一步暴露了美英帝国主义和苏修统治集团正紧密勾结，企图遏制亚非拉人民和全世界人民高涨的革命运动。
    声明说，这一条约阻止不了发起国美、苏、英进行这种武器的“垂直扩散”，根本不能限制他们生产、贮存甚至在战争中使用这种武器，没有包含保证发起国不首先使用这种武器的条款。
    声明谴责这个条约实质上是剥夺其他签字国为了自卫发展他们自己的核力量和生产核武器的权利，另一方面，条约却允许美帝国主义进一步加强它在国内外的核武器。声明说，美英帝国主义和苏联修正主义者保证“援助”受到核攻击威胁的无核签字国，这就等于宣布这些无核签字国是他们的保护国。
    声明指出，条约不仅企图建立美英帝国主义和苏修统治者之间对“保护国”的政治和军事的霸权，而更主要的是企图共同对付中国。中国已经粉碎了美苏核垄断，从而推进了亚非拉人民争取民族解放的反帝事业。
    声明最后说，“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”人民经过坚决斗争，将击败以美国为首的帝国主义者以及他们的同谋者苏修统治集团的所谓大国政治的种种阴谋诡计。
