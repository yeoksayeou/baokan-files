The friendship between the people of China and Tanzania blossoms in splendor
— A Record of the Tanzanian People Celebrating the Birth of the Friendship Textile Factory Built with Chinese Aid

In early July, the capital of Tanzania, Dar es Salaam, was filled with festive scenes as people joyfully celebrated their annual national holiday, the "Saba Saba" (July 7th) festival. At this joyous moment, exciting news arrived—the Friendship Textile Factory, built with Chinese aid, was officially completed. As President Nyerere said at the completion ceremony on July 6th, the birth of the Friendship Textile Factory is the "most joyful and proudest event" for the Tanzanian people.

To commemorate the deep friendship between the two countries, the Tanzanian people named this factory the Friendship Textile Factory when construction began in July 1966.

This massive textile factory is located in the Ubanago Industrial Zone on the western outskirts of Dar es Salaam. Surrounded by green shrubs, the factory buildings are tall and elegant, painted in a light yellow color. The flat factory roads connect the more than twenty projects within the factory into a cohesive whole. On the day of the opening, July 6th, the Friendship Textile Factory was adorned in festive attire, welcoming thousands of Tanzanian visitors.

To spread the news of the birth of Tanzania's largest and first state-owned modern textile and dyeing integrated enterprise, the official newspaper of the ruling party of Tanzania, the Tanganyika African National Union, the "Nationalist," and other publications, all dedicated significant space on July 6th to introduce this factory, which produces 24 million square yards of fabric and 2 million pounds of cotton yarn annually. The "Nationalist" pointed out, "The Friendship Textile Factory is the first factory in East Africa equipped with dyeing facilities, representing a significant effort by Tanzania to achieve modern textile industry and a major step towards self-reliance."

During the "Saba Saba" festival, at the Tanzania National Agricultural and Trade Exhibition held in Dar es Salaam, the Friendship Textile Factory exhibition hall was praised as an excellent example of self-reliance and won the first prize at the exhibition. Tens of thousands of visitors from various parts of Tanzania and other East African countries were amazed to see Tanzanian workers weaving colorful fabrics from locally produced cotton. They exclaimed: The completion of the Friendship Textile Factory is another glorious achievement for the Tanzanian people in developing their national economy along the path of self-reliance.

The factory produces over eighty varieties of dyed and printed fabrics, including the colorful "Kanga" (a traditional East African fabric worn by women) and "Vitange" (a fabric used by women to make clothes and by men to make shirts), bringing national pride to every visitor. The completion of the Friendship Textile Factory will help Tanzania, a major cotton-producing country, break free from imperialist exploitation and end the long-standing practice of foreign capitalists importing raw cotton from Tanzania at low prices and exporting textiles to Tanzania at high prices. One Tanzanian woman said, "I love the fabrics produced by the Friendship Textile Factory because they are made in Tanzania." Many visitors wrote in the guestbook: "Excellent!" "Outstanding achievement," "Highest standard," "Example of self-reliance."

People were delighted to see that Tanzania now has its first generation of dyeing workers. Nearly four hundred workers in the dyeing plant have mastered skills such as bleaching, finishing, engraving, chemical analysis, and pattern design. A female worker, Urasa, who started learning from drawing lines, designed a popular national pattern for "Kanga" under the guidance of Chinese technical personnel in less than half a year. This new pattern "Kanga" has been approved by relevant Tanzanian departments and will soon be mass-produced.

The modern equipment of this textile factory has been praised by the Tanzanian people. The stable operation, ease of use, and suitability for Tanzania's textile industry development of the factory's spinning, weaving, dyeing, printing, refrigeration, and mechanical maintenance equipment have been highly appreciated. The Tanzanian people cherish these mechanical equipment and are determined to use them to further develop Tanzania's national economy.

During the construction of the factory, Chinese engineering and technical personnel consistently focused on training Tanzanian workers and technical cadres. Currently, over two thousand Tanzanian workers in the factory have basically mastered the production technology and have the initial ability to operate independently. This fact left a deep impression on every visitor. More than sixty workers in the fine spinning workshop, after less than a year of training, can each operate six hundred spindles, and some can operate eight hundred spindles. Young workers Juma and Kamis not only mastered all the fine spinning operation techniques but also learned production management.

Chinese engineering and technical personnel, remembering the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, regarded helping the Tanzanian people build the textile factory as their internationalist duty. From the day they arrived at the construction site until they completed their mission and left, they worked alongside Tanzanian workers. They treated Tanzanian workers like their own brothers, providing help and care, patiently teaching technical knowledge, and forming a close friendship with Tanzanian workers. Tanzanian staff who worked with Chinese engineering and technical personnel unanimously praised them as the "best foreign experts" and "good workers taught by Chairman Mao." A Western European textile expert once asked a Tanzanian official from the Tanzania National Development Corporation about the reason for the rapid completion of the Friendship Textile Factory. The Tanzanian friend frankly told him: "The 'secret' of the Chinese is that their experts personally participate in the labor, treat people equally, and blend in with Tanzanian workers."

The Tanzanian people celebrate the Friendship Textile Factory as another splendid flower blooming under the cultivation of Tanzanian-Chinese friendship, a crystallization of friendship. When the Tanzanian people saw the large photograph of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, receiving President Nyerere of Tanzania and his wife, along with other Tanzanian friends in Beijing on June 21st, they were excited to congratulate the new developments in the friendship between the two countries. Some Tanzanian friends wrote in the guestbook with emotion: "China is our true friend," "Long live the friendship between Tanzania and China!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!"

Imperialism and its lackeys have always attempted to sabotage the close friendship between China and Tanzania, but their plots have met with shameful failure. Contrary to their wishes, the friendship between the people of China and Tanzania will continue to grow stronger.

    中坦两国人民友谊开放灿烂之花
    ——记坦桑尼亚人民欢呼中国援建的友谊纺织厂诞生
    七月上旬，坦桑尼亚首都达累斯萨拉姆一片节日景象，人们在兴高采烈地欢庆一年一度的民族节日——“萨巴萨巴”（意为七月七日）节。正在这个愉快的时刻，传来了激动人心的喜讯——中国援助建设的坦桑尼亚友谊纺织厂正式落成了。正如尼雷尔总统在七月六日主持这个工厂落成仪式时所说的，友谊纺织厂的诞生是坦桑尼亚人民“最高兴和最值得骄傲的事情”。
    坦桑尼亚人民和中国人民为了铭志两国之间存在着的深厚友谊，早在一九六六年七月动工兴建这个工厂时，就将它定名为友谊纺织厂。
    这座规模巨大的纺织厂，位于达累斯萨拉姆西郊乌邦果工业区。绿色的灌木林环抱着一排排高大美观的淡黄色厂房。平坦的厂区道路把全厂二十几个项目的建筑物连成一片。在七月六日开幕这一天，友谊纺织厂披上了节日的盛装，迎接数以千计的前来参观的坦桑尼亚人。
    为了把坦桑尼亚最大的、第一个国营的现代化纺织印染联合企业诞生的喜讯告诉人们，坦桑尼亚执政党坦噶尼喀非洲民族联盟机关报《民族主义者报》以及其他报刊，都在七月六日这一天用很大的篇幅介绍了这个年产二千四百万平方码布匹和二百万磅棉纱的工厂。《民族主义者报》指出，“友谊纺织厂是东非第一个拥有印染设备的最完备的工厂，它不仅是坦桑尼亚为拥有现代化的纺织工业而作的巨大努力，而且也是走向自力更生的一个重大步骤。”
    在“萨巴萨巴”节期间，在达累斯萨拉姆举行的坦桑尼亚“全国农业和贸易博览会”上，友谊纺织厂展览馆被誉为自力更生的良好范例，并荣获博览会一等奖。数万名来自坦桑尼亚各地和其他东非国家的观众，看到坦桑尼亚工人用本国出产的棉花织成彩色缤纷的各种布匹，都赞不绝口。他们欢呼：友谊纺织厂的建成，是坦桑尼亚人民沿着自力更生的道路发展民族经济的又一个辉煌的成果。
    这个工厂生产的八十多种色布、花布，东非妇女喜爱的“康加”（东非妇女披在头上和围在身上的印有彩色民族图案的花布）和
  “维坦格”（东非妇女用来做衣服、男子用来做衬衫的花布），给每个参观者带来了民族自豪的喜悦。友谊纺织厂的建成将有助于盛产棉花的坦桑尼亚摆脱帝国主义的剥削，结束外国资本家长期以来低价从坦桑尼亚进口原棉、高价向坦桑尼亚人民出口纺织品的状况。一位坦桑尼亚妇女说，“我最喜欢友谊纺织厂出产的布，因为它是坦桑尼亚自己的产品”。许多观众在留言簿上写下的评语是：“好极了！”“杰出的成绩”、“最高的水平”、“自力更生的榜样”。
    人们高兴地看到：坦桑尼亚有了第一代印染工人。印染厂的近四百名工人分别学会了漂染、整理、雕刻、化验和花样设计等技术。花样设计组一位从描线条开始学起的女工乌拉莎，在中国技术人员指导下学了不到半年，便为“康加”设计出一种引人喜爱的民族图案。她设计的这种新图案的“康加”已得到坦桑尼亚有关部门的批准，即将大批生产。
    这个纺织厂的现代化设备获得了坦桑尼亚人民的赞扬。全厂的纺纱、织布、染色、印花以及冷冻、机修等机械设备运转稳定，易于操作，适合坦桑尼亚发展纺织工业的需要。坦桑尼亚人民非常珍惜这些机械设备，决心用它们来进一步发展坦桑尼亚民族经济。
    在建厂过程中，中国工程技术人员一直注意培训坦桑尼亚工人和技术干部。目前，全厂两千多名坦桑尼亚工人基本上掌握了生产技术，初步具备了独立操作的能力。这一事实给每一个参观者留下了深刻的印象。一号厂细纱车间的六十多名工人，经过不到一年的培训，每人都能看六百个纱锭，有的能看八百个纱锭。青年工人朱马和卡米斯不仅掌握了细纱操作的全部技术，而且还学会了生产管理。
    中国工程技术人员，牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导，把帮助坦桑尼亚人民兴建纺织厂看成是自己应尽的国际主义义务。从到达工地的第一天起到完成任务离开工地时止，他们都同坦桑尼亚工人一道参加劳动。他们对坦桑尼亚工人就象对自己的兄弟一样，给予帮助和关怀，耐心传授技术知识，同坦桑尼亚工人结成了亲密的友谊。同中国工程技术人员一道工作过的坦桑尼亚人员都异口同声地称赞他们是“最好的外国专家”、
  “毛主席教导的好工人”。一位西欧纺织专家曾向坦桑尼亚全国发展公司一位负责人探听友谊纺织厂迅速建成的原因。这位坦桑尼亚朋友直率地告诉他：“中国人的‘秘密’是他们的专家亲自参加劳动，平等待人，和坦桑尼亚工人打成一片”。
    坦桑尼亚人民欢呼友谊纺织厂是在坦中友谊培育下开放的又一朵灿烂的鲜花，是友谊的结晶。当坦桑尼亚人民看到纺织厂展出的中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席六月二十一日在北京接见坦桑尼亚总统尼雷尔和夫人及其他坦桑尼亚朋友的巨幅照片时，都兴奋地祝贺两国友谊的新发展。有的坦桑尼亚朋友在留言簿上激情地写道：“中国是我们真正的朋友”、“祝坦中友谊万古长青！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    帝国主义及其走狗一直妄图破坏中坦两国之间的亲密友谊，他们的阴谋遭到了可耻的失败。与他们的愿望相反，中国和坦桑尼亚人民之间的友谊必将日益向前发展。　新华社记者
