Japanese people in Fukuoka bravely rushed into the station, blocking a U.S. military train carrying supplies for the Vietnam War. Workers and students chanted slogans of perseverance and anti-imperialism, striking back against reactionary police sent to suppress them.

	NEW DELHI, July 17 (Xinhua) - According to a report from the Eastern Communications Agency, workers, youth, and students in Fukuoka Prefecture, who have been continuously fighting against U.S. military bases for the past three months, rushed into the Noshiro Station in Kitakyushu City this morning. They sat on the tracks in a sit-in protest, blocking a train carrying ammunition for the U.S. military's invasion of Vietnam, thereby firmly supporting the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression.

	According to the report, the U.S. military authorities in Japan and the reactionary Sato government announced their plan to start transporting thousands of tons of ammunition from the U.S. military base in Kure City, Hiroshima Prefecture, to the Yamada Ammunition Depot near Kitakyushu City over seven days starting from July 17.

	Seven hundred patriotic workers and students from Fukuoka Prefecture began gathering around Noshiro Station near the Yamada Ammunition Depot early in the morning of July 17, holding red flags. Before the train loaded with ammunition arrived at Noshiro Station, they rushed into the station and sat on the tracks. Soon, the train loaded with 120 tons of ammunition approached, blowing its whistle.

	At that time, the large crowd of protesters shouted slogans such as "U.S. imperialism out of Vietnam!" "Demolish the Yamada Ammunition Depot!" "Oppose the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty!" and forced the train to stop.

	The entire train, from the locomotive to all the carriages, was covered with slogans reading "Japanese people fight alongside Vietnamese people!" "U.S. imperialism out of Japan!" "Down with the reactionary Sato government!" These slogans were pasted on the train by national railway workers before it arrived at Noshiro Station.

	The Sato government dispatched 1,000 armed police and national railway "security" personnel to surround and threaten the patriotic students and workers sitting on the tracks. At this time, about 1,000 citizens gathered there strongly supported the sit-in protest of the patriotic students and workers, and strongly protested against the police's unreasonable threats.

	About an hour later, the police and railway "security" personnel suddenly attacked the protesters. About 50 members of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), led by the vice-chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters, Yoshida Hosei, fought back bravely with the workers and students. Finally, they held a protest meeting in front of the Yamada Ammunition Depot gate. They shouted slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "We will persist in the patriotic just struggle!" and sang the "Internationale."

	In the struggle on July 17, eight people were unlawfully arrested by the police.

    日本人民同越南人民战斗在一起
    福冈群众不怕牺牲英勇冲进车站，阻拦美军侵越军火货车
    工人学生高呼坚持斗争、打倒美帝口号，击前来镇压的反动警察
    新华社十七日讯　据东方通讯社报道：三个月来连续进行反对美国军事基地的斗争的福冈县工人、青年和学生，十七日上午冲进北九州市南小仓车站，在铁轨上举行静坐示威，阻挡了一列为美军运输侵越战争弹药的货车，以实际行动坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国战争。
    据报道，驻日美军当局和佐藤反动政府宣布它们计划从十七日开始，在七天内，要从广岛县吴市美军基地运输一千几百吨弹药到北九州市附近山田弹药库。
    福冈县七百名爱国工人和学生从十七日清晨开始就高举红旗，聚集在山田弹药库附近的南小仓车站的周围。当那列装载着弹药的列车到达南小仓车站之前，他们就冲进了车站，坐在铁轨上。不久，那列装载着一百二十吨弹药的列车鸣着警笛，开来了。
    当时，大批示威群众齐声高呼：“美帝国主义滚出越南！”“拆除山田弹药库！”“反对日美安全条约！”等口号，迫使这列货车停了下来。
    这列货车从火车头到所有的车厢都贴满了标语，上面写着“日本人民同越南人民战斗在一起！”“美帝国主义滚出日本！”“打倒佐藤反动政府！”等。这些标语是国营铁道工人在这列货车到达南小仓站以前贴上去的。
    佐藤政府出动了一千人的武装警察和国营铁路“保安”人员，包围和恫吓在铁轨上举行静坐斗争的爱国学生和工人。这时，聚集在那里的约一千名市民热烈地支持爱国学生和工人的静坐斗争，强烈抗议警察的无理威胁。
    约一小时后，警察和铁路“保安”人员对示威群众发动突然的袭击。福冈县日中友好协会（正统）总部会员约五十人，在日中友好协会（正统）总部副会长吉田法晴率领下，跟工人和学生一起，进行了英勇反击。最后，他们在山田弹药库大门前举行抗议大会。他们高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“我们要坚持爱国正义斗争！”等口号，并高唱《国际歌》。
    在十七日的斗争中，有八人被警察无理逮捕。
