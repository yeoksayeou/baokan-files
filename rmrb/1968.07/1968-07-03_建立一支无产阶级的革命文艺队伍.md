Every time we step onto the stage of revolutionary modern Peking opera, brimming with fighting spirit, we feel our blood boiling. How can we forget that under the rule of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line of the Chinese Khrushchev, the Peking opera stage was filled with a thick atmosphere of reverence for the past and neglect of the present, and reverence for the dead and neglect of the living? It was at this moment that our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with great courage, led a group of revolutionary literary and art warriors to break through the layers of obstacles set up by the counter-revolutionary literary black line and charge out of the old Peking opera camp, which was shrouded in dark clouds and demonic fog. With a thunderous roar, Comrade Jiang Qing, with all her heart's blood, nurtured eight model operas that shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. These operas were born in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, and opened a brilliant new chapter in the history of human literature.

However, a handful of class enemies at home and abroad are terrified and hate the model operas to the core. When Comrade Jiang Qing led our troupe's revolutionary literary and art warriors to create the model opera "The Red Lantern," the Chinese Khrushchev's agents in our troupe did everything they could to oppose and sabotage it, trying to strangle this new revolutionary thing in its cradle. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they were still not satisfied and continued to play various tricks, trying to sabotage the model operas. With Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, we smashed the evil plots of the class enemies and exposed those traitors, spies, die-hard capitalist roaders, and other counter-revolutionaries who had infiltrated our troupe. We launched a thorough and prolonged revolutionary criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev and the biggest handful of capitalist roaders within the party, defending the model operas, defending our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our literary and art workers must complete this task, must shift their stand, must gradually shift to the workers, peasants, and soldiers and to the proletariat in the course of deepening their ties with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, participating in the practical struggle, and learning from Marxism and learning from society." Comrade Jiang Qing instructs us: "To perform revolutionary plays, one must first become a revolutionary." Following Chairman Mao's great teachings and Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions, we went deep into the countryside to temper and transform ourselves, promoting the revolutionization of our thinking. Not long ago, we carried our bags and marched on foot to the suburbs of Beijing to support the summer harvest. During the support for the summer harvest, we received a profound class education and tempering through labor. In the past, the Chinese Khrushchev and the capitalist roaders in the troupe brazenly opposed literary and art workers going to the countryside and opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line, not allowing us to go to the countryside to transform our thinking. The Chinese Khrushchev said things like, "Literary and art workers can go to the countryside by organizing a few buses, living and eating on the buses." The capitalist roaders in the troupe also said things like, "Performers generally should not participate in heavy labor. Old artists and main performers should mainly focus on being close to the masses and can participate in labor less or not at all." They also said things like, "Working and marching back to the stage... Performers who go down for a long time will lose their appetite and will avoid it in the future." This time, when we went down to support the summer harvest, we did not ride in cars, and the main performers and general performers, leaders, and ordinary members all carried their own bags and marched on foot without anyone falling behind. We did not "live and eat on the buses" but ate the same food as the poor and lower-middle peasants and worked together to cut wheat, thresh, and dig irrigation canals. After work, we also performed a cappella singing and drum performances for the poor and lower-middle peasants. Under conditions without stage sets, costumes, or props, comrades like Qian Haoliang, Liu Changyu, Wang Jinghua, and Yuan Shihai actively and meticulously performed excerpts from the model opera "The Red Lantern" for the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. Not only did we not "lose our appetite," but our enthusiasm increased, and we sang higher and more loudly. We did not "avoid labor as a dreaded path" but took labor as a good opportunity to temper and transform ourselves. Comrades said, "Through labor, our hands became rough, our faces became dark, but our hearts became redder."

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, after watching our performances, enthusiastically said, "Watching your performances of the model operas made us see the direction of proletarian new literature and art!" "Your direction is correct, and your path is right." The poor and lower-middle peasants' high praise for the model operas further ignited our boundless love for Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line and further strengthened our resolve to perform revolutionary modern plays for a lifetime and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a lifetime. We feel that advancing along Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line is victory!

After more than two years of the stormy baptism of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the awareness of the two-line struggle among the broad revolutionary literary and art warriors in our troupe has reached an unprecedented height, and our boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and our boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line have been further strengthened. At present, we respond to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," and we are determined to perform the model operas well for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers with full political enthusiasm. At the same time, with unyielding class hatred, we will launch a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in our troupe, thoroughly and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, and completely eliminate all the poisonous influences of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line. We are full of confidence, and under the guidance of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, we vow to build the Peking Opera Troupe, nurtured by Comrade Jiang Qing, into a proletarian revolutionary literary and art troupe that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    建立一支无产阶级的革命文艺队伍
    中国京剧团革命委员会
    每当我们满怀战斗的豪情走上红彤彤的革命现代京剧舞台，便感到浑身热血沸腾。我们怎能忘记，在中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义文艺黑线的统治下，京剧舞台上曾经充斥着一片厚古薄今、厚死薄生的恶浊空气。就在这样的时刻，我们敬爱的江青同志高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以大无畏的英雄气概，率领着一批革命文艺战士，排除了反革命文艺黑线设下的层层障碍，从那黑云滚滚，妖雾迷漫的旧京剧营垒中冲杀了出来。春雷一声震天响，江青同志用满腔心血辛勤培育的八个闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的革命样板戏，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中诞生了，在人类文艺史上揭开了光辉灿烂的新篇章。
    可是，国内外一小撮阶级敌人对革命样板戏怕得要死，恨得要命。在江青同志率领我团革命文艺战士创作革命样板戏《红灯记》的时候，中国赫鲁晓夫安插在我团的代理人千方百计地反对和进行破坏，妄图把这个革命的新生事物扼杀在摇篮里。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们仍然贼心不死，继续玩弄种种阴谋诡计，妄图破坏革命样板戏。我们以毛泽东思想为武器，粉碎了阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋，把那些混进我团的一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和其他反革命分子揪了出来。我们对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派展开了深入持久的革命大批判，捍卫了革命样板戏，捍卫了我们敬爱的江青同志，捍卫了毛主席的革命文艺路线。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的文艺工作者一定要完成这个任务，一定要把立足点移过来，一定要在深入工农兵群众、深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马克思主义和学习社会的过程中，逐渐地移过来，移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。只有这样，我们才能有真正为工农兵的文艺，真正无产阶级的文艺。”江青同志指示我们：“要演革命戏，先做革命人。”我们遵照毛主席的伟大教导和江青同志的指示，深入农村，锻炼改造自己，促进思想革命化。前不久，我们背着背包、扛着行李，徒步行军奔赴北京郊区支援夏收。在支援夏收的过程中，我们受到了一次深刻的阶级教育和劳动锻炼。过去，中国赫鲁晓夫和剧团的走资派肆无忌惮地反对文艺工作者深入工农兵，反对毛主席的革命文艺路线，不让我们深入工农兵改造思想。中国赫鲁晓夫说什么文艺工作者下乡可以“组织几个大汽车，在车上住，车上吃”。剧团的走资派也说什么：“演员一般不宜参加过重的生产劳动。老艺人，主要演员应以接近群众为主，可少参加或不参加劳动。”又说什么：“干活行军回功，……演员下去久了，要倒胃口，将来视为畏途。”我们这次下去支援夏收，不仅没有坐汽车，而且主要演员和一般演员，领导干部和一般群众无一例外，都是自己背背包、扛行李徒步行军，没有一个人掉队。我们不是“在车上住，车上吃”，而是和贫下中农吃同样的饭菜，一起干割麦、打场、挖水渠等重体力劳动。劳动之余，我们还为贫下中农演出清唱、翻打表演。在没有布景、没有服装、没有道具的条件下，钱浩梁、刘长瑜、王晶华、袁世海等同志还积极地、一丝不苟地为广大贫下中农演出了革命样板戏《红灯记》等片断。我们不仅没有“回功”，而且干劲倍增，比平时翻得更高，唱得更响亮。不但没有把劳动“视为畏途”，而且把劳动当作锻炼改造自己的好机会。同志们说：“通过劳动，手粗了，脸黑了，心更红了。”
    广大的贫下中农看了我们的演出以后，热情地说：“看了你们演出的革命样板戏，使我们看到了无产阶级新文艺的方向！”“你们的方向正确了，路子走对了。”贫下中农对革命样板戏的高度赞扬，更加激起了我们对毛主席革命文艺路线的无比热爱，更加坚定了我们演一辈子革命现代戏、为工农兵服务一辈子的革命决心。我们体会到：沿着毛主席的革命文艺路线前进就是胜利！
    经过两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的暴风雨的洗礼，我团广大革命文艺战士的两条路线斗争觉悟空前提高，进一步增强了对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对毛主席革命文艺路线的无限忠诚。当前，我们响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召，决心以饱满的政治热情，为广大的工农兵群众演好革命样板戏。同时，怀着不共戴天的阶级仇恨，坚决地、不停顿地向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在我团的代理人发动猛烈进攻，深入持久地开展革命大批判，彻底肃清反革命修正主义文艺黑线的一切流毒。我们满怀信心，在光辉的毛泽东思想的指引下，誓把江青同志培育的中国京剧团建设成为一支无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的无产阶级革命文艺队伍。
