The Chinese Ministry of National Defense held a banquet this evening to warmly welcome the military delegation of the Republic of Guinea.

With Colonel Kamara Diabi, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Guinean National People's Army, at the head of the delegation, all members of the Guinean military delegation and Mr. Kamara, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Guinean Embassy in China, were invited to the banquet.

At the banquet, filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere, Vice Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Wang Xinting, and Colonel Kamara Diabi spoke successively, praising the combat friendship between the peoples and the armed forces of China and Guinea.

Comrade Wang Xinting praised the Guinean people, who have a glorious tradition of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism, for foiling the subversive and interventionist plots of imperialism and its lackeys under the leadership of President Sekou Toure. He noted that Guinea has achieved remarkable successes in maintaining national independence, developing the national economy, and strengthening national defense.

Comrade Wang Xinting said that the revolutionary situation of the world's peoples against imperialism is excellent. However, as our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "All reactionary forces, when they are on the verge of extinction, will always struggle desperately." Wang Xinting strongly condemned the crimes of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism in colluding to suppress the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. He said that we are convinced that the conspiracies and tricks of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys will only provoke stronger resistance from the peoples of the world, accelerating their own downfall.

He said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, is advancing rapidly towards all-round victory, and the situation throughout the country is better than ever.

Comrade Wang Xinting said that the peoples of China and Guinea are close comrades-in-arms in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. In the struggle against our common enemies and in the construction of our respective countries, our two peoples have always supported and encouraged each other, working closely together. We are convinced that the visit of the Guinean military delegation will make a valuable contribution to enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between our two peoples and our two armed forces.

Colonel Kamara Diabi, in his speech, expressed gratitude for the warm welcome extended by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, militia, and Red Guards. He said that they believe this visit will help strengthen the friendship and sincere brotherly cooperation between the peoples and the armed forces of the two countries.

He said that at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong, is successfully proceeding, we have the opportunity to come to China, which is a rare opportunity for us.

He said that at a time when imperialism and old and new colonialism are shamelessly hatching conspiracies, waging wars of aggression in Vietnam and the Middle East, and brutally suppressing the national liberation struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the peoples of Guinea and China need to consolidate our friendship and unity more than ever to confront our common enemy—the international imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism.

Colonel Kamara Diabi pointed out that their stay in China would be beneficial because it would enable the armed forces of the two countries to learn from each other and gain more experience for continuing the revolution.

Those who attended the banquet to accompany the guests included Zhang Lingbin, Ding Xilin, and other responsible officials from the various departments and services of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and relevant departments, as well as representatives of the capital's militia and Red Guards.

Military attachés from various countries' embassies in China were also invited to the banquet.

    我国防部欢宴几内亚共和国军事代表团
    在充满热烈友好的气氛中，宾主共颂中几两国人民和两国军队之间的战斗友谊
    新华社二十四日讯　我国国防部今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎几内亚共和国军事代表团。
    以几内亚国家人民军副总参谋长卡曼·迪亚比上校为首的几内亚共和国军事代表团全体成员，几内亚共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办卡马拉，应邀出席了宴会。
    在充满热烈友好气氛的宴会上，中国人民解放军副总参谋长王新亭和卡曼·迪亚比上校先后讲话，共颂中几两国人民和两国军队之间的战斗友谊。
    王新亭同志赞扬具有反帝反殖光荣传统的几内亚人民在塞古·杜尔总统的领导下，不断粉碎了帝国主义及其走狗的颠覆和干涉阴谋，在维护民族独立、发展民族经济和加强国防建设等方面，取得了显著的成就。
    王新亭同志说，目前，全世界人民的反帝革命形势一片大好。但是，正如我们伟大领袖毛主席指出的：“一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。”王新亭同志强烈谴责美帝苏修勾结在一起，加紧镇压亚非拉民族解放运动和各国人民的革命斗争的罪行。他说，我们深信，美帝国主义及其走狗的阴谋伎俩，只会激起世界人民更加强烈的反抗，加速它们自己的灭亡。
    他说，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的我国无产阶级文化大革命，正在向全面胜利迅猛发展，全国形势空前大好。
    王新亭同志说，中几两国人民是反帝、反殖的亲密战友。在反对共同敌人和建设各自祖国的斗争中，我们两国人民一向是互相支援、互相鼓舞、亲密合作的。我们深信，几内亚军事代表团的这次访问，必将对增进我们两国人民和两国军队之间的相互了解和友谊作出宝贵的贡献。
    卡曼·迪亚比上校在讲话中，对中国人民解放军指战员、民兵和红卫兵所给予的热烈欢迎表示感谢。他说，我们相信，这次访问将有助于加强我们两国人民、两国军队之间的友谊和真诚的兄弟般的合作。
    他说，正当中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命在成功地进行的时候，我们能够来到中国，这对我们来说，是一个难得的机会。
    他说，正当帝国主义和新老殖民主义肆无忌惮地制造阴谋，在越南和中东发动侵略战争并残酷地镇压亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放斗争的时候，几中两国比以往任何时候都更加需要巩固我们的友谊和团结，以便对付我们共同的敌人——以美帝国主义为首的国际帝国主义。
    卡曼·迪亚比上校指出，他们在中国的逗留将是有益的，因为它将使几中两国军队能够互相学习，并为继续进行革命取得更多的经验。
    出席宴会作陪的，有中国人民解放军各总部、各军种兵种，北京市革命委员会和有关方面的负责人张令彬、丁西林等，以及首都民兵和红卫兵的代表。
    各国驻中国大使馆武官也应邀出席了宴会。
