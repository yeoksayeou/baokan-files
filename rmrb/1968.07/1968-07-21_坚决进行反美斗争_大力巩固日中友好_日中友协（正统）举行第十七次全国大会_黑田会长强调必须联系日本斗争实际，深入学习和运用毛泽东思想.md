The 17th National Congress of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) was held on July 19 at the Chiyoda Public Hall in Tokyo. About 400 representatives from all over the country attended the congress.

A large portrait of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of the world, was hung prominently on the stage.

Kuroda Jutaro, president of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), delivered the opening speech. He said, "Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is advancing towards complete victory and is providing valuable lessons for the people of the world. We must deeply study Mao Zedong Thought, closely link it with the actual conditions in Japan, and apply it to strengthen the activities of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine)."

Kuroda emphasized, "The Japan-U.S. security system is the biggest obstacle to Japan-China friendship. Smashing the Japan-U.S. security system is a joint task for the people of Japan and China and is an urgent task we face in developing the Japan-China friendship movement."

Kuroda pointed out: The Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) has actively carried out struggles against Sato Eisaku's "visit" to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits who usurped Chinese territory in Taiwan, the puppet regime in South Vietnam, and the United States, as well as against Chiang Ching-kuo's visit to Japan. It has actively participated in the anti-American patriotic struggles in Fukuoka, Kitakyushu, Sanrizuka, and Oji, among other places. He also said that the Japan-China friendship movement is a part of the broad united front against American imperialism. We must do our utmost to struggle for the withdrawal of American military bases and the return of Okinawa to Japan, and strengthen the struggle against the Japan-U.S. security system.

Daijo Masao, chairman of the newly established Okinawa Prefecture Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), spoke at the congress, pointing out that U.S. imperialism has long used Okinawa as a nuclear base to invade the People's Republic of China and Asia. The people of Okinawa have waged a heroic struggle against U.S. imperialism.

Daijo said: The people of Okinawa have risen up to break through many ordinances that the occupying U.S. forces have long imposed on them. Daijo pointed out: Resolutely carrying out the struggle against U.S. imperialism is an important aspect of strengthening the unity of the people of Japan and China.

The congress, to the warmest applause, read the congratulatory messages from the China-Japan Friendship Association and the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, as well as other organizations.

The congress discussed and approved the report on the association's activities in 1967 and the guidelines for 1968.

Sakamoto Tetsumatsu, chairman of the Japan Committee for Asia-Africa Solidarity, Shibahara Sadatsugu, executive director of the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade, Nakajima Takeshige, chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, and Igata Daiji, representative of the Japan Socialist Party, were invited to attend the congress and delivered congratulatory speeches.

Staff members of the China-Japan Liaohe Trade Office's liaison office in Tokyo and representatives of the crew of the Chinese cargo ship "Dongfeng," currently docked in Japan, were also invited to attend the congress.

From July 19 to 21, the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) held its 17th National Congress in Tokyo. The picture shows the opening ceremony of the congress.
