The great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, led by Comrade Mao Zedong, is vigorously celebrating its 47th anniversary on the great journey of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Mao Zedong teaches us: "The Communist Party of China, armed with Marxism-Leninism, has produced new working styles among the Chinese people. The main ones are the style of combining theory with practice, the style of maintaining close ties with the masses, and the style of self-criticism." The excellent style of maintaining close ties with the masses, personally cultivated by Chairman Mao, has been greatly developed in the great mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in the fierce struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev. It has mobilized the broadest masses and demonstrated unprecedented revolutionary power to change the world.

At present, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories. The plot of the Chinese Khrushchev and other representatives of the bourgeois reactionary forces to restore capitalism in China has suffered a shameful failure. Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line have been grasped by the broad revolutionary masses. In most parts of the country, revolutionary committees have been generally established. The land of socialist motherland is flourishing. The situation in our country is better than ever before. However, class struggle is still sharp and complex. A small handful of defeated class enemies, though at the end of the road, are still making desperate struggles. Under such circumstances, it is of great significance to continue to carry forward the Party's style of maintaining close ties with the masses in consolidating and developing the victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, consolidating and developing the new revolutionary committees, strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Comrade Mao Zedong recently pointed out profoundly: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie."

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, it cannot avoid experiencing extremely fierce and repeated class struggles. The struggle between the bourgeoisie's attempt to restore capitalism and the proletariat's opposition to restoration will last for a long time. The process of gradually consolidating and developing the revolutionary committees is a process of serious class struggle. At the same time, it is a process of learning from the masses and continuously summing up experience. We must have a clear understanding of this. At present, the enemy is trying every means to separate and sabotage the ties between the new revolutionary committees and the masses. They either spread a rightist wind of reversal, attempting to confuse class lines and shift the direction of struggle; or they fire sugar-coated bullets, attempting to deceive or corrupt our comrades, causing some members of the revolutionary committees to become detached from the masses. In response to these characteristics, the revolutionary committees must always direct the spearhead of struggle against a small handful of diehard capitalist-roaders, traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and actively lead the revolutionary masses to strike the enemy steadily, accurately, and fiercely; at the same time, under any circumstances, we must resolutely protect the broad masses of the people. Relying on the broad masses of the people and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat are two aspects of the same problem. Whether it is criticizing right opportunism, right splitism, or right capitulationism, or whether it is cleaning up class ranks, the class content is consistent, all for protecting the broad masses of the people and striking a small number of class enemies. We must closely combine the cleaning up of class ranks and the struggle-criticism-transformation in various units to continue to carry out a powerful revolutionary criticism. We must be good at exposing and daring to expose the various despicable tactics of a small number of counter-revolutionaries who sabotage and distort the various strategic tasks proposed by the proletarian headquarters. Various revolutionary masses should pay attention to uniting against the enemy. In the complex class struggle, they must strictly distinguish between two types of contradictions, be good at handling contradictions among the people, and be good at identifying contradictions between the enemy and us.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "The first function of the dictatorship of the proletariat is to suppress the reactionary classes, reactionaries, and exploiters who resist the socialist revolution within the country, and those who sabotage socialist construction, that is, to solve the contradictions between the enemy and us within the country." Comrade Mao Zedong also said: "Who will exercise the dictatorship? Of course, it is the working class and the people under its leadership. The system of dictatorship is not applicable to the people. The people cannot exercise dictatorship over themselves, nor can one part of the people oppress another part of the people." These extremely profound Marxist analyses by Comrade Mao Zedong have great guiding significance for us in handling contradictions between the enemy and us and contradictions among the people (such as contradictions between various revolutionary organizations) at present!

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The most fundamental thing in the reform of state organs is to maintain ties with the masses." The people are the source of power for the proletarian dictatorship. Resolutely relying on and maintaining close ties with the people is the fundamental mark that distinguishes the proletarian party and proletarian dictatorship from all forms of bourgeois parties and dictatorships. The rich experience of many places shows: the revolutionary committees born in the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with representatives of the revolutionary masses, the army, and revolutionary cadres, have a deep mass foundation and inherently have the superior condition of maintaining ties with the masses. We must fully utilize and develop this superiority, resolutely oppose the infiltration of bureaucratism, resolutely reform the old rules and customs of detachment from the masses, maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest ties with the working people, so that the revolutionary committees deeply take root among the masses and become revolutionary, authoritative, and vigorous proletarian command posts.

Members of the revolutionary committees are ordinary laborers and should go deep among the masses, not engage in special privileges. They should consult with the masses on all matters and actively participate in socialist production labor. Comrade Mao Zedong teaches us: "To concentrate from the masses and then go back to the masses to persist, to form correct leadership opinions, this is the basic leadership method." All revolutionary old cadres and new cadres who have emerged in the cultural revolution mass movement should implement this instruction from Comrade Mao Zedong, always maintain the flesh-and-blood ties with the masses, and the style of maintaining ties with the masses should not change even if the position changes.

Members of the revolutionary committees, regardless of their origin, should all be representatives of the broad revolutionary masses and should act according to Mao Zedong Thought and the principles of proletarian party spirit. They must not represent only a small faction while ignoring the broad revolutionary masses; they must not unite only a few people while neglecting the vast majority of the masses. Individualism, factionalism, cliquism, sectarianism, and anarchism are not proletarian thoughts but bourgeois thoughts. Within the revolutionary committees, we must constantly use Mao Zedong Thought, the worldview of the proletariat, to criticize various bourgeois ideological influences, so as to continuously consolidate the great alliance of revolution and the revolutionary committees.

Revolutionary masses should cherish the new revolutionary committees. Revolutionary committees should actively accept the criticism and supervision of the revolutionary masses. Where the masses can frequently and enthusiastically criticize and suggest improvements with a protective attitude, it indicates that the democratic atmosphere is good there, the work is lively, and the relationship between the revolutionary committees and the masses is close. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The Communist Party is not afraid of criticism because we are Marxists, and the truth is on our side. The basic masses of workers and peasants are on our side." As for a small handful of enemies who use "criticism" as a pretext to stir up trouble and maliciously attack, attempting to undermine the revolutionary committees, their plots must be resolutely exposed and struck down.

"Only the people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history." Now, reading this famous saying by Comrade Mao Zedong, we feel how profound it is! The rich experience of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has educated us that to carry out a thorough revolution against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, we must have the great guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, mobilize and rely on the broad revolutionary masses, rely on the People's Liberation Army, and rely on the majority of cadres. The Chinese Khrushchev clique, the remnants of the Kuomintang, and the small handful of agents of the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists within our Party have long been pushing a whole set of counter-revolutionary revisionist lines and Kuomintang-style work styles, all aimed at creating a separation between the Party and the masses, a separation between the proletarian dictatorship and the masses, in order to achieve their evil goal of hiding their reactionary faces and restoring capitalism. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong, further fundamentally solves the problem of the ties between the Party, the state power, and the masses, thus ensuring that our country will never change color.

Mao Zedong Thought and Comrade Mao Zedong's revolutionary line most concentratedly represent the fundamental interests of the people, most concentratedly embody the will and demands of the proletariat and the broad masses of the people. We must insist on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, firmly implement Comrade Mao Zedong's revolutionary line, and timely, accurately, and comprehensively implement the combat tasks and policies of the proletarian headquarters led by Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Lin Biao, turning them into the conscious actions of the masses. This is the fundamental task of the revolutionary committees. In the process of striving to complete this task, the revolutionary committees can only establish close ties with the broad masses of the people and be heart to heart with the people. To carry out this task in a broader scope and in depth, we must continue to vigorously run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, adding new content as the revolutionary mass movement develops, continuously improving the political consciousness of the revolutionary masses, and making the Mao Zedong Thought study classes a great force to promote the victory of all work.

At the historic moment of achieving great victories, such as on the eve of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and when the War of Liberation was about to achieve nationwide victory, Comrade Mao Zedong always called on the whole Party to be alert and pay great attention to the issue of work style, regarding the maintenance and development of the Party's traditional work style as an important guarantee for uniting the whole Party and the broad revolutionary masses, overcoming difficulties, defeating the enemy, consolidating victories, and developing victories.

Now, the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not far away, and consolidating and developing this victory will require a long time and great efforts. As long as we rely on the people, firmly believe that the creative power of the masses is boundless, and therefore trust the people and unite with them, we can overcome any difficulties and defeat any enemy, and only we will be able to defeat them.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great movement to mobilize hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses to rectify the Party. Under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's proletarian party line, the whole Party and the people of the whole country have launched an unprecedented large-scale revolutionary criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist party line of the Chinese Khrushchev. Through this storm of mass movement, our Party has greatly strengthened its ties with the masses and is becoming purer, stronger, and more vigorous. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our broad Party members must withstand various severe tests of class struggle, further use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their worldviews, and strive to truly become advanced elements of the proletariat. We will surely accomplish the great historical mission of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and make greater contributions to the communist movement.

Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live our great leader Chairman Mao!

    发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风
    ——纪念、中国共产党诞生四十七周年
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》社论
    以毛泽东同志为领袖的伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大征途中，生气蓬勃地迎接自己四十七周年的光辉节日。
    毛主席教导我们：“以马克思列宁主义的理论思想武装起来的中国共产党，在中国人民中产生了新的工作作风，这主要的就是理论和实践相结合的作风，和人民群众紧密地联系在一起的作风以及自我批评的作风。”毛主席亲自培育的我们党的这种密切联系群众的优良作风，在无产阶级文化大革命的伟大群众运动的风暴中，在同中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线的剧烈斗争中，得到了极大的发展，最广泛地发动了群众，显示出改造世界的空前巨大的革命威力。
    当前，无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性胜利。以中国赫鲁晓夫等为代表的资产阶级反动势力在中国实现资本主义复辟的阴谋，遭到了可耻的失败。毛泽东思想、毛主席的无产阶级革命路线为广大的革命群众所掌握。在全国绝大多数地区，各级革命委员会已经普遍建立起来了。社会主义祖国的大地上，一片欣欣向荣的景象。我国的形势比以往任何时候都好。但是，阶级斗争还是尖锐而复杂的。一小撮失败了的阶级敌人已经穷途末路，仍然要作垂死的挣扎。在这种形势下，继续发扬我们党的紧密联系群众的作风，对于巩固和发展无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，巩固和发展新生的革命委员会，加强无产阶级专政，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，具有非常重大的意义。
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”
    无产阶级文化大革命，既然是无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，就不能不经历十分剧烈的反复的阶级斗争。资产阶级企图复辟和无产阶级反对复辟的斗争，会经历一个很长时期。革命委员会逐步巩固、发展的过程，是一个严重的阶级斗争的过程。同时，又是向群众学习和不断总结经验的过程。我们对此必须有清醒的认识。当前，敌人千方百计地企图离间和破坏新生的革命委员会同群众的联系。他们或者大刮右倾翻案黑风，妄图扰乱阶级阵线，转移斗争大方向；或者施放糖衣炮弹，妄图欺骗或腐蚀我们的同志，使革命委员会某些成员脱离群众。针对这种特点，革命委员会要始终把斗争矛头对准一小撮顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，主动地带领革命群众，稳、准、狠地打击敌人；同时，在任何时候，在任何情况下，都要坚决保护广大人民群众。依靠广大人民群众，加强无产阶级专政，这是同一个问题的两个侧面。不论是批判右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，不论是清理阶级队伍，其阶级内容是一致的，都是为了保护广大人民群众，打击极少数阶级敌人。要紧紧结合清理阶级队伍、各单位斗、批、改，继续有力地开展革命的大批判。对于极少数反革命分子破坏并歪曲无产阶级司令部提出的各项战略任务，对于敌人那种种的卑鄙手段，必须善于识破，勇于揭露。各派革命群众要注意团结对敌，在复杂的阶级斗争中，要严格分别两类不同性质的矛盾，既要善于处理人民内部矛盾，又要善于识别敌我矛盾。
    毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中指出：无产阶级专政的“第一个作用，就是压迫国家内部的反动阶级、反动派和反抗社会主义革命的剥削者，压迫那些对于社会主义建设的破坏者，就是为了解决国内敌我之间的矛盾。”毛主席又说：“谁来行使专政呢？当然是工人阶级和在它领导下的人民。专政的制度不适用于人民内部。人民自己不能向自己专政，不能由一部分人民去压迫另一部分人民。”毛主席这些极其深刻的马克思主义的分析，对于我们当前处理敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾（如各个革命组织之间的矛盾），有多么重大的指导意义啊！
    毛主席指出：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”人民群众是无产阶级政权力量的源泉。坚决依靠和密切联系人民群众，是无产阶级政党和无产阶级政权区别于一切形式的资产阶级政党、政权的根本标志。许多地方革命委员会的丰富经验说明：在无产阶级文化大革命群众运动的暴风雨中诞生的，有革命群众的代表、军队的代表和革命干部的代表参加的三结合的革命委员会，有着深厚的群众基础，本身就具有联系群众的优越条件。我们一定要充分运用和发挥这种优越性，坚决反对官僚主义的侵袭，坚决改革旧的脱离群众的陈规旧习，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系，使革命委员会深深地扎根于群众之中，成为革命的、有无产阶级权威的、朝气蓬勃的战斗指挥部。
    革命委员会的成员，是普通劳动者，要深入群众之中，不要搞特殊化。遇事多和群众商量，积极参加社会主义生产劳动。毛主席教导我们：“从群众中集中起来又到群众中坚持下去，以形成正确的领导意见，这是基本的领导方法。”广大革命的老干部，在文化大革命群众运动中涌现出来的新干部，都要实行毛主席的这个指示，永远保持和群众的血肉联系，职务变了，联系群众的作风不能变。
    革命委员会的成员，不管来自那个方面，都应当是广大革命人民群众的代表，都应当按照毛泽东思想办事，按照无产阶级的党性原则办事。决不能只代表某个小山头，而不代表广大革命人民群众；只团结少数人，而置绝大多数群众于不顾。个人主义、山头主义、小团体主义、宗派主义、无政府主义不是无产阶级的思想，而是资产阶级的思想。在革命委员会内部，我们必须经常地用毛泽东思想即无产阶级的世界观去批判各种资产阶级思想的影响，才能不断巩固革命大联合，巩固革命委员会。
    革命群众要爱护新生的革命委员会。革命委员会要主动地接受革命群众的批评和监督。那里的群众能够经常地踊跃地以爱护的态度对改进工作提出批评和建议，就说明那里的民主空气好，那里的工作有生气，那里的革命委员会同群众的关系密切。毛主席指出：“共产党是不怕批评的，因为我们是马克思主义者，真理是在我们方面，工农基本群众是在我们方面。”至于一小撮敌人借“批评”为名而兴风作浪，恶毒攻击，企图动摇革命委员会的阴谋，则必须坚决予以揭露和打击。
    “人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”现在读着毛主席这句名言，感觉是多么深刻呵！无产阶级文化大革命的丰富经验教育了我们，进行一场反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的彻底的革命，必须有毛泽东思想的伟大指导，必须发动和依靠广大革命人民群众，必须依靠人民解放军，必须依靠干部的大多数。中国赫鲁晓夫一伙，国民党的残渣余孽以及地、富、反、坏、右在我们党内的一小撮代理人，他们长期以来推行一整套反革命修正主义路线，搞的一套国民党的作风，都是制造党和群众的分离，制造无产阶级政权和群众的分离，以达到他们隐藏自己反动面目、复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，进一步从根本上解决党、政权和人民群众的联系问题，从而保证我们国家永远不变颜色。
    毛泽东思想，毛主席的革命路线，最集中地代表了人民群众的根本利益，最集中地体现了无产阶级和广大人民群众的意志和要求。坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，坚定地执行毛主席的革命路线，及时地准确地全面地把以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗任务和方针政策，落实到群众中去，变为群众的自觉行动，这是革命委员会的根本任务。在努力完成这个任务的过程中，革命委员会才能同广大人民群众取得密切联系，与人民群众心连心。为了在更广大的范围内，深入地推行这个任务，必须继续大力办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，随着革命群众运动的发展而增加新的内容，不断提高革命群众的政治觉悟，使毛泽东思想学习班成为促进各项工作胜利的巨大力量。
    在夺取伟大胜利的历史关头，例如在抗日战争胜利前夕，在解放战争即将取得全国胜利的时候，毛主席在提出革命任务、路线、方针和政策的同时，总是号召全党提起警觉，十分注意作风问题，把保持和发扬党的传统作风，看作是团结全党和广大革命群众，克服困难，战胜敌人，巩固胜利，发展胜利的重要保证。
    现在，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利已经不远了，巩固和发展这个胜利，则是需要很久的时间和付出巨大的努力的。只要我们依靠人民，坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而信任人民，和人民打成一片，那就任何困难也能克服，任何敌人也不能压倒我们，而只会被我们所压倒。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是发动亿万革命群众进行整党的一次伟大运动。全党和全国人民，在毛主席无产阶级建党路线的指引下，对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义建党路线展开了空前规模的革命大批判。经过这场群众运动风暴的洗炼和考验，我们的党，和群众的联系极大地加强了，正在变得更加纯洁、更加坚强、更加朝气蓬勃。我们广大的共产党员在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，必须经得起阶级斗争的各种严峻的考验，进一步用毛泽东思想来改造自己的世界观，努力使自己真正成为无产阶级的先进分子。我们一定能够完成在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的伟大历史使命，为共产主义运动做出更大的贡献。
    伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
