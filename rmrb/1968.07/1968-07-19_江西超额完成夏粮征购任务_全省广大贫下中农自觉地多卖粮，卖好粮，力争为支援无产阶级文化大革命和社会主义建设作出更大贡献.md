Jiangxi Exceeds Summer Grain Procurement Task

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants across Jiangxi Province have voluntarily sold more and better grain, striving to make greater contributions to supporting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 17th - The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Jiangxi Province, which has achieved a bumper summer grain harvest this year, are enthusiastically selling grain to the state with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. By the beginning of July, the entire province had already exceeded the summer grain procurement task. Currently, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are striving to sell even more grain to the state, aiming to make greater contributions to supporting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction.

"Navigating the vast sea requires a helmsman; revolution requires Mao Zedong Thought." Members of various levels of revolutionary committees in Jiangxi Province, following Chairman Mao's great directive to "grasp grain tightly," have gone deep into communes and production brigades to help poor and lower-middle peasants establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, thoroughly implementing Chairman Mao's latest series of directives. After studying, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, voluntarily sell more and better grain. They say: This year's bumper summer grain harvest is a victory of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and a fruitful result of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Selling more grain to the state is our expression of loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

During the summer grain procurement period, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Jiangxi's rural areas have focused on class struggle, launching a revolutionary criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," and "material incentives." This has heightened their awareness of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, effectively promoting the summer grain procurement work. Some places, while deepening the struggle against the enemy, have smashed the schemes of a handful of class enemies attempting to sabotage the summer grain procurement, completing the procurement task ahead of schedule in just a few days. In some counties, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, through launching revolutionary criticism, have expressed: Chairman Mao teaches us, "Only socialism can save China." We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and resolutely take the broad socialist path. They have raised the red flag, beaten drums, and enthusiastically exceeded the summer grain procurement task.
