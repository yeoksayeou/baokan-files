	Eagles in the Storm
	—The Story of the Unity Between the Military and Civilians in Albania

	Border defense soldier Skanderli hummed a pleasant mountain song as he cleaned his gun. The melody reminded him of the mountains, hills, meadows, pastures, and flocks of sheep in Namad. All day long, he had been thinking about the hay for the agricultural cooperative. Friends from the village wrote to him, saying that the cooperative had plenty of hay and that the winter feed was guaranteed.

	"Look at you, so happy!" said border post commander Nihat Duka as he walked up to Skanderli and patted his shoulder.

	"Comrade Commander, I am a soldier of the people's army. How can I not be happy for the cooperative's harvest?" Skanderli replied, handing the commander the letter from his village. Nihat listened attentively as Skanderli spoke. Skanderli had grown up in the countryside and had deep feelings for his village, which made the commander especially happy.

	"Now we have an urgent mission to carry out!" Nihat said sternly. "What do you say, comrades?"

	"Each one of us is like an eagle!" Skanderli replied promptly. Then he asked the other two soldiers, "Are you ready?"

	"Ready!" the two comrades replied in unison.

	The wind howled, and large snowflakes danced in the air, covering the mountains and fields in a thick blanket of white. The biting cold wind stung the faces of the border defense soldiers. The iron-willed border defense soldiers braved the wind and snow, guns in hand, advancing swiftly one after another, their eyes keenly observing everything around them.

	Forward! Brave forward! Their footprints in the snow were quickly covered by the falling snow. The small team leader Skanderli frequently turned back to encourage his comrades to press on.

	Soon they arrived at the designated location. They gathered in a circle to confirm their respective tasks. The small team did not leave the task execution site for a moment. Each of them executed their tasks with high spirits.

	The snow continued to fall without stopping, covering the mountains and fields in a vast expanse of white. No roads could be found. After completing their mission, they immediately started their return journey. The three comrades walked side by side, carefully navigating through the snow. Their boots sank deep into the snow, and it took all their strength to take a few steps. The further they went, the harder it became. The sky darkened, the snow blocked the mountains, and the north wind howled. The lives of the small team members were in danger. Everyone understood this, but no one showed any fear. They encouraged and inspired each other, bravely advancing against the raging wind and snow.

	Suddenly, "thud!" Spilo fell into a deep pit. His comrades rushed over to rescue him. Spilo had kicked his leg too hard, and one of his boots got stuck in the snow hole. His comrades quickly found something to wrap around his foot, but it fell off after a few steps. The two comrades immediately picked up Spilo and continued forward, fighting fiercely against the wind and snow.

	They slowly made their way to a small grove, using the small trees and oaks to determine their direction. Looking up, they saw a pile of oak wood in front of them and hurried over to rest against the wood for a moment. The wind and snow here were much less than before, and the young men happily shouted, "Now there is no danger!" "We will definitely find our comrades..."

	The three border defense soldiers stopped at the foot of the mountain by the pile of wood, hungry and thirsty. However, their lofty revolutionary ideals supported them, and the party's teachings gave them immense encouragement. They thought of the warm instructions from the Labor Party and Comrade Hoxha, and of the heroic deeds of the socialist labor hero Adam Reka and the fifteen-year-old communist Shkuta Vata. A warm current flowed through their bodies, making them more spirited.

	"Determined to return to the border post!" "Definitely find our comrades!" In the howling wind, the three comrades, with their unwavering loyalty to the party and the people, fought against nature.

	Commander Nihat was restless, and the other border defense soldiers were also worried about the small team. Half the night had passed, and there was still no news from the small team. The on-duty soldiers reported from time to time, "Storm! They haven't returned yet!"

	"We must take immediate action!" the commander told the soldiers.

	"We will go find our comrades!" All the soldiers were eager to go.

	"We will go! But we need to divide the tasks well! Every post must be manned. Strengthen the forces! Some will go find the small team, and the rest will carry out other tasks!" Commander Nihat clearly explained the tasks to everyone.

	"Ask the villagers to help!" someone suggested.

	"Good, take action!" the commander ordered the signal to be sent immediately.

	After a while, twenty members of the agricultural cooperative, some with guns on their backs and others with shovels and axes, gathered together. The commander decided to send six soldiers and one nurse with the cooperative members to search for the small team.

	The night was dark, and the roads were invisible. People divided into several groups to search for the missing comrades, frequently calling out the names of the small team members, but all they heard was the howling wind. The soldiers and cooperative members trampled through the thick ice and snow, using shovels to clear paths on the high slopes.

	More cooperative members from the nearby village of Kosaj came to help search for the missing comrades.

	The military loves the people, and the people support the military. The military and the people are like one family. The border defense soldiers wholeheartedly helped the cooperative with farming and harvesting, and the cooperative members helped the border defense post with sentry duty. What deep bonds of friendship between the military and the people! Not only at the Qahanaj border post were there such touching stories, but throughout Albania, the song of military and people unity and joint struggle echoed everywhere. In the deep forests of Debar, a brave couple, risking their lives, captured alive the spies sent by the Soviet revisionist clique to Albania; in Cajë, the local people personally arrested the spies who infiltrated the border; in Orgjost, the farmers fought against the bandits, foiling the enemy's plot; and the young Zejral Marqini has become a famous little hero nationwide for defending the sacred borders of the motherland. The sweat of the border defense soldiers flowed on the land of the cooperative, and they shared the joy of the first grain self-sufficiency with the cooperative members.

	Twenty cooperative members and border defense soldiers, full of passion, searched for their loved ones. Time flew by, and the east began to brighten. It was another gloomy day, with low-hanging clouds pressing down on the earth, and large flakes of snow swirling in the sky. The cold was intense, and it was truly difficult to walk. People searched every hill and slope but found no trace of the small team. However, everyone did not lose hope and decided to search again on the road leading to the mountain top. There were tall trees there, and everyone thought that to determine the direction, the small team might have stopped there. Ahead were a few more slopes, and after walking for half an hour, they indeed found a few shallow footprints in the snow on the slope.

	"Send a signal!" one soldier said urgently. Another soldier fired a shot into the air with a bang.

	Silence! Silence! People stared wide-eyed into the distance, and suddenly, not far away, they heard a shout, followed by a long echo. "The small team is there!" a cooperative member said confidently, and everyone rushed towards the place where the shout came from.

	Several hours later, Commander Nihat reported to his superiors by telephone:

	"Last night, a small team from the L area border defense was missing on duty. We searched with the local people and later found them by a grove of oaks. Skanderli and another soldier are in good health, but Spilo's toes are frozen. We had a bull carry him to the Korum Hospital for immediate treatment. There is a cooperative member named Liza Çahnaj who helped us search for the missing small team and is now among us. The high revolutionary spirit of our people and countless heroic deeds have deeply moved him. Under the strong encouragement of the shining examples of Adam Reka, Shkuta Vata, and other advanced figures, he requested to replace the border defense soldier Spilo until he fully recovers and returns to his post. Liza said that when he carried the frostbitten Spilo on his shoulders, he made this decision. Liza has worked on the southern border of the motherland and is always ready to serve the motherland and the people. He is a very, very good young man..."

	Good news came from the Kukus Hospital and the Qahanaj border post: Spilo is now being treated in Kukus and will soon be discharged. The people of Qahanaj are singing and dancing, celebrating the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Albanian People's Army; the mountain people of Kukus are working day and night, engaged in a great battle to conquer nature... The songs of victory resound, and the news of triumphs is frequent. The people and the army are like one family, working together to build socialism and defend the beautiful rivers and mountains of the land of the eagles!

    风暴中的群鹰
    ——阿尔巴尼亚军民团结亲如家人的事迹
    边防军战士斯坎德利一面擦枪，一面愉快地哼着动听的山歌。歌声使他想起纳玛底的群山、高坡、草地、牧场和羊群。整整一天，他一直在惦着农业生产合作社牧草的事。村里的朋友们写信告诉他，社里的牧草绰绰有余，过冬的饲料保证没有问题。
      “瞧你这个高兴劲儿！”边防站站长尼哈特·都卡依走到斯坎德利的面前，拍着他的肩头说。
    “站长同志，我是个人民军战士，怎能不为农业社的丰收高兴呢？”斯坎德利一边说一边掏出村里人的来信递给站长。尼哈特注意地听他讲话，斯坎德利是在农村长大的，对农村怀有深厚的感情，这使站长感到特别高兴。
    “现在要执行一件紧急任务！”尼哈特站长严肃地说：“怎么样啊，同志们？”
      “一个个都象鹰一样！”斯坎德利干脆利落地说。然后又对另外两个战士问道：“你们准备好了吗？”
      “准备好了！”两个战友异口同声地回答。
    寒风呼啸，鹅毛似的大雪漫天飞舞，把山野覆盖得白皑皑的。刺骨的寒风刮着边防军战士的面颊。钢铁般坚强的边防军战士冒着风雪，端着枪，一个跟着一个急速前进，聚精会神地注视着周围的一切。
    向前进！勇敢地向前进！脚印刚刚落在雪地上，马上就被大雪盖住了。小分队队长斯坎德利不时地回过头来，鼓励同志们前进。
    很快来到了指定的地点，大家团团围在一起，确定了各自的任务。小分队一刻也未离开执行任务的地点。他们个个精神抖擞地执行着任务。
    大雪一直下个不停，满山遍野白茫茫的一片，什么道路也找不见。任务完成后，他们马上往回赶路。三个战友留神地肩并肩地在雪海中前进。皮靴子深深地陷在雪地里，使出浑身劲儿才走了几步，越往前，道路越加难走了。天昏地暗，大雪封山，朔风呼啸，小分队同志们的生命处在危险之中。每人都明白这一点，但谁都没有一点惧怕的表情，大家互相勉励、互相鼓舞，迎着狂风暴雪奋勇前进。
    忽然间，“咕咚”一声，斯皮洛掉进了一个深坑里，同志们立刻奔上去抢救。斯皮洛拔腿用力过猛，把一只靴子陷在雪窟窿里了。同志们赶紧找出一点东西替他把脚缠上，但是没有走上几步，缠在脚上的东西就掉了。两位同志立刻把斯皮洛背起来，继续前进，同暴风雪展开了激烈的搏斗。
    他们一步步地来到一个小丛林旁，凭小树丛和橡树辨别方向。一抬头，发现前面有一垛橡木，于是便赶到那里，依偎着木头休息了片刻。这里的风雪比前面小多了，小伙子们高兴地喊：“现在没有什么危险了！”“我们一定会找到同志们……”
    三个边防军战士停留在山脚下的木垛旁边，又饥又渴。但是，崇高的革命理想支持着他们，党的教导给了他们巨大的鼓舞力量。想起了劳动党和霍查同志的亲切教导，想起了社会主义劳动英雄亚当·雷卡和十五岁的共产党员什库塔·瓦塔的英勇事迹，一股股的暖流通过了他们的全身，使他们更加振作起来。
      “坚决赶回边防站！”“一定找到战友们！”在寒风呼啸中，三个战友怀着对党和人民的无限忠诚，同大自然搏斗着。
    站长尼哈特坐立不安，其他的边防军战士也在为小分队担心。半夜已过，小分队还没有一点消息。值班的战士不时地报告：“暴风雪！他们还没回来！”
      “要马上采取行动！”站长对战士们说。
      “我们去找同志们！”全体战士摩拳擦掌，挺身而出。
      “我们去！但需要好好分一下工！任何一个岗位都必须有人坚守。力量要加强！一部分人去找小分队，其他的同志去执行别的任务！”站长尼哈特把任务对大家讲得清清楚楚。
      “需要请老乡来帮忙！”一个人提出建议。
      “好，行动吧！”站长命令立即发信号。
    过了一会儿，二十名农业社社员有的背着枪，有的扛着铁锹、斧头聚集在一起了。站长决定叫六名战士和一名护士一起同社员们出发寻找小分队。
    沉沉的黑夜，道路都看不见。人们分成几组，分头寻找失踪的同志，不时地呼喊着小分队队员的名字，可是，得到的却是风雪嗖嗖的呼啸声。战士和社员们踏着厚厚的冰雪，用铁锹在高高的山坡上开辟道路。
    从不远的科萨依村又来了一大批社员帮助寻找失踪的同志。
    军爱民，民拥军，军民如同一家人。边防军战士一心一意帮助农业社耕地、收割，农业社社员帮助边防军站岗放哨，军民之间结下了多么深厚的情谊啊！不仅在查哈纳依边防站有这样动人的事迹，而且在整个阿尔巴尼亚到处都响彻着军民一家、共同战斗的赞歌。在迪勃拉的深山密林里，勇敢的夫妇，不顾生命安危，活捉苏修叛徒集团派往阿尔巴尼亚的间谍；在恰耶，当地群众亲自逮捕偷越国境的特务；在奥尔焦斯特，农民同匪徒展开战斗，使敌人的阴谋遭到彻底破产；而少年泽拉尔·玛尔底尼，已经成为闻名全国的保卫神圣祖国边疆的小英雄。边防军战士辛勤的汗水流在农业社的土地上，他们同社员共同分享第一次粮食自给的欢乐。
    二十名社员和边防军战士满怀激情，寻找着自己的亲人。时间飞快地过去，东方已经发白。又是一个阴霾的日子，乌云低低的压着大地，大片大片的雪花满天翻滚，天寒地冻，走起路来可真难啊！人们找遍了荒山野坡，怎么也未发现小分队的足迹。但是，大家并没有失去信心，决定再到通往山顶的道路上寻找。那里长着高高的树木，大家想，为了辨认方向，小分队也许会停留在那儿。前面又是几道山坡，大家走了半小时，果然在山坡的雪地上发现了几个浅浅的脚印。
      “发信号！”一个战士着急地说。另一个战士啪地一声向高空打了一枪。
    寂静！寂静！人们睁大着眼向远处瞭望，突然不远的地方传来了呼喊声，紧接着又传来了长长的回声。“小分队在那里！”一个社员肯定地讲，于是大家便向发出喊声的地方飞跑过去。
    几小时之后，站长尼哈特向上级打电话报告说：
    “L区边防军的一个小分队昨天夜里执勤时失踪。我们和当地群众一起寻找，后来在一个橡树林旁找到了他们。斯坎德利与另一战士身体健康情况良好，唯有斯皮洛，他的脚指冻僵了。我们用公牛把他驮到科鲁姆医院立刻进行了治疗。有一位农业社社员名叫利札·查赫拿依，和我们一道寻找失踪的小分队，现在他就在我们中间。我国人民高昂的革命精神，无数的英雄事迹深深地感动了他，在光辉的榜样亚当·雷卡、什库塔·瓦塔等人先进事迹的强烈鼓舞下，他要求替换边防军战士斯皮洛，直到他完全恢复健康，回到战斗岗位为止。利札说，当他把冻伤了脚的斯皮洛背在肩上的时候，就下定了这个决心。利札在祖国南方的边防线上工作过，他随时都准备为祖国和人民服务，这是一个非常非常好的小伙子……”
    从库科斯医院和查哈纳依边防站又传来了喜讯：斯皮洛现在正在库科斯治疗，很快就会出院。查哈纳依的人们载歌载舞，欢庆阿尔巴尼亚人民军建军二十五周年；库科斯的山民日夜劳动，正在进行一场征服大自然的伟大战斗……凯歌阵阵，捷报频传，人民和军队亲如一家，齐心进行社会主义建设，保卫山鹰之国的锦绣河山！
