The revolutionary workers of the Qingdao Power Plant, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have displayed a spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress. They have utilized an old-style boiler, designed and modified it themselves, successfully creating the nation's first medium-pressure vertical cyclone boiler. This boiler is characterized by its small size, high efficiency, low power generation cost, and reduced risk of extinguishment. The successful modification of this boiler provides practical experience for China in manufacturing cyclone boilers and opens up new avenues for saving coal used in power generation and burning low-quality coal.

With the assistance of sister units and the collective efforts of all revolutionary workers, the plant completed the design and modification of the nation's first medium-pressure vertical cyclone boiler in just eleven months, a task that would have originally taken two years. After running tests and technical appraisals by relevant departments, it was proven that the quality of this boiler is excellent. According to scientific calculations, it can save the nation more than 13,000 tons of coal annually.

    全国第一台中压立式旋风锅炉
    青岛发电厂革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，利用一台旧式锅炉，自己设计，改造成功了全国第一台中压立式旋风炉。这台锅炉具有体积小，效率高，发电成本低，不易发生灭火事故等特点。这台锅炉的改造成功，为我国制造旋风式锅炉提供了实践经验，为节约发电用煤和燃烧劣质煤开辟了新的途径。
    在兄弟单位的协助下，在全体革命职工的努力下，这个厂只用十一个月的时间，就多、快、好、省地设计、改造成功了全国第一台中压立式旋风炉，完成了本来需要两年时间才能完成的任务。经过运行试验和有关部门的技术鉴定，证明这种锅炉质量良好。据科学计算，每年可为国家节约一万三千多吨煤炭。
