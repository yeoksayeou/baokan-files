One day, mechanic soldier Ye Xiuzhi received a notice: he was to go to a sister unit to give a report, introducing their experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought in the class struggle and line struggle on the "Sea Pioneer Boat." Ye Xiuzhi was not very enthusiastic when he received the task. Political instructor Yang Xizhu noticed this and had a heart-to-heart talk with Ye Xiuzhi in the evening.

Ye Xiuzhi was born in hardship and grew up in comfort, holding boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. To defend Chairman Mao, he would dare to face any danger; in naval battles, he had made contributions to the people. In daily work, he was so diligent that he would take on the heaviest tasks without complaining. But why did he not want to give the report? Ye Xiuzhi told Yang Xizhu, "Comrade instructor, you know, when I speak at a meeting, my heart beats so fast. Asking me to give a report, I really don't have that ability. It's better to let me do more heavy and tedious work!"

It was midnight, and Ye Xiuzhi locked himself in the engine room, repeatedly pondering over the words the instructor had said to him: "Propagating and defending Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the highest duty of every revolutionary soldier. This ability is not something one can have or not have! If one does not have this ability and is not willing to learn it, then one is not a soldier with a high level of proletarian consciousness." He felt that the instructor's words were very weighty, causing a great stir in his heart. For the first time since enlisting, he had such doubts: "Could it be that my consciousness is still problematic?" He picked up Chairman Mao's latest instructions and began to study them word by word: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" He repeatedly read this great teaching, examining his thoughts and activities since the Cultural Revolution, only then realizing that he had such ideas: we are just little soldiers; the struggle between the two lines is the leaders' business. If we do our specific work well, we are following Chairman Mao's words.

The next day, Ye Xiuzhi gathered many materials for revolutionary criticism and spent several days reading them. As he read, he criticized himself, and as he criticized, he thought: Luo Ruiqing advocated that "military affairs are politics," intending to make the cadres and soldiers focus on military affairs and professional skills, becoming politically confused, so that these bad guys could freely restore capitalism. His idea of "little soldiers handling little affairs" just fits the requirements of the bourgeois reactionary military line and the needs of the counter-revolutionary revisionists to usurp the party, the army, and the country.

Ye Xiuzhi underwent a great change. A few days later, the boat held a meeting to study and discuss Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Ye Xiuzhi was not the main speaker, but he was the first to volunteer to speak. His logic was profound and clear, and his words were vivid and fluent. This not only surprised his comrades but also made him wonder: "How come I am no longer afraid and can speak endlessly?" Political instructor Yang Xizhu understood Ye Xiuzhi's change: a person who raises their consciousness of class struggle and line struggle thinks more and deeper about state affairs, naturally will have courage and wisdom, and thus can speak well. Yang Xizhu was delighted and had another heart-to-heart talk with Ye Xiuzhi that night, encouraging him to continue moving forward.

    “小兵”应该管大事
    南建新
    一天，机电兵叶秀志接到通知：让他到一个兄弟单位作报告，介绍他们“海上先锋艇”在阶级斗争和路线斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想的经验。叶秀志在接受任务时，不那么痛快。指导员杨希竹看在眼里，晚上便找叶秀志谈心。
    叶秀志，在苦水里生，在甜水里长，对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱。为保卫毛主席去作战他能赴汤蹈火，在海战中他为人民立了功。在日常工作中，那样活重，他抢那样干，从不叫苦不叫累。但他为什么不愿去作报告呢？叶秀志这样对杨希竹说：“指导员，你是知道的，我在会上发个言，心都跳得厉害，叫我作报告，我确实没这本事，还是让我多干点重活累活吧！”
    深夜十二点了，叶秀志把自己关在机舱里，反复思索着指导员刚才对他说的话：“宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想和毛主席革命路线，是每个革命战士的最高职责，这分本事，不是可以有可以无的！如果没有这分本事，又不愿学会这分本事，就不是具有高度无产阶级觉悟的战士。”他觉得指导员这番话分量很重，心头引起很大震动。他入伍几年来头一次产生这样的疑问：“难道我的觉悟还有问题吗？”他拿起毛主席的最新指示，逐字逐句地学起来：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”他反复地读着这个伟大教导，一点一滴地检查自己自从文化大革命以来的思想活动，才发觉自己有这样的想法：咱们是小兵，两条路线斗争是上头的事，咱们尽力做好具体工作，就是听毛主席的话了。
    第二天，叶秀志找来许多革命大批判的材料，一连看了几天。一边看，一边自己进行批判，一边批，一边想：罗瑞卿鼓吹“军事就是政治”，是想让指战员都埋头搞军事，搞业务，在政治上成为糊涂人，好让这帮坏蛋为所欲为地复辟资本主义，而自己那个“小兵管小事”的想法，正好适合资产阶级反动军事路线的要求，适合反革命修正主义分子篡党、篡军、篡国的需要。
    叶秀志发生了很大的变化。几天以后，艇上举办学习毛主席革命路线讲用会，叶秀志并不是重点发言人，可他第一个抢先发言，道理讲得深刻明白，话也说得生动流畅。这不仅叫同志们吃了一惊，就连他自己也觉得奇怪：“怎么我变得一点也不怕，讲起来没个完了呢？”指导员杨希竹是了解叶秀志这个变化的：一个人提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，对国家的大事想得多，想得深，自然就会有勇敢，有智慧，话当然也就能讲好。杨希竹喜在心头，当晚又找叶秀志谈心，鼓励他继续前进。
