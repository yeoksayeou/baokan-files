Three Visits to Factory Nine

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, one of the first places in the country to establish a revolutionary committee was Qindao City by the Jiaozhou Bay. We visited a textile factory with several thousand workers there.

This factory, ranked ninth among the nine textile factories in the city, is called "National Cotton Mill No. 9." Before liberation, it was called "Huaxin." Despite its pleasant-sounding name, it was actually old and dilapidated, neither "new" nor "glorious." Its machinery was outdated, and production was slow. The factory had equipment from 1912 from Britain, 1913 from Germany, and from the 1920s from Japan, the United States, and Spain—all junk. Although some machinery was renovated and added after liberation, it remained backward compared to the rest of the city and the country. The equipment was old, and so were the people. Before the Cultural Revolution, a descendant of a Qing dynasty governor controlled its financial power, and a bourgeois element controlled its administrative power. Within the factory, there were remnants of the Kuomintang's takeover, yellow union cadres, spies, and feudal foremen mixed in with the workers, a chaotic mess. People said, "Huaxin" was a "big dye vat," a "big cauldron." Once you entered the factory, the red could be dyed black, and young people could be "fried into old oil sticks." The factory was established by imperialist invaders, bought by feudal bureaucrats, and taken over by bureaucratic capitalists. After the three big mountains were overthrown, the capitalist roaders within the party took it over. Therefore, it had always been backward, truly the ninth among the nine textile factories in the city. If compared nationwide, it might be the ninety-ninth—eighty-one! Some workers disliked the "nine" in National Cotton Mill No. 9, finding it inauspicious. They said that to shed the backward hat, the factory name must be changed.

With the Cultural Revolution's cannon roar, the proletarian revolutionary faction of Factory Nine seized the party, government, financial, and cultural power of the entire factory on January 20 last year, dragging out the capitalist roaders and a handful of class enemies. They said, "What's inauspicious about the 'nine'? We don't rely on heaven or earth. With Mao Zedong Thought, the sky is ours, the earth is ours. We will create miracles from this mess, turning the last into the first!" On the day of the seizure, a serious problem faced the newly born revolutionary committee: the month was already twenty days old, but the production plan was only half completed. The capitalist roaders sneered in secret, the wanderers roamed the factory, and the revolutionary faction was in intense thought: what to do? what to do? The factory revolutionary committee emphasized proletarian politics, grasped the fundamentals, and first held a rally, distributing three treasures to every revolutionary worker in the factory: a set of four-volume Little Red Book, a Mao Zedong badge, and a Mao Zedong statue, urging everyone to achieve "grasp revolution, promote production" with bountiful results to report to the great leader Chairman Mao. Everyone held the three treasures, facing Mao's portrait, solemnly swore: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You supported us in seizing power, we must make you proud!" They spoke and acted, not firing blanks. All revolutionary workers in the factory stood tall, working day and night. In just nine days, they completed the remaining half of the monthly plan, achieving 101.6% of the monthly plan in January, firing the first shot! From then on, the plan was overfulfilled every month, production soared; from crawling like a snail to marching forward in big strides, the last became the first! It was one of the few factories nationwide that could be counted on one hand.

Factory Nine transformed and renewed itself. Look, the workshops were "spouting clouds and spitting smoke," shuttles flying like stars, machines swallowing bales of cotton and spitting out rolls of cloth. Colorful printed fabrics hung high on the dyeing machines, flowing down like a waterfall! Workers pointed to various popular domestic and international new products, excitedly telling us, "Don't look down on our old factory, our contribution to supporting world revolution cannot be small!" We looked around, seeing Mao's quotations and slogans everywhere in the workshops, revolutionary big-character posters and criticism columns dotted around. Everyone wore a bright red "Loyal to Chairman Mao" badge on their chest, showing their loyalty to Chairman Mao. The flames of revolutionary criticism burned fiercely, showing their hatred for China's Khrushchev. Seeing this lively revolutionary scene, a strong desire to learn from local leftists and take workers as teachers attracted us. But it was late, we decided to visit Factory Nine another day.

The second visit to Factory Nine. We visited various personnel from the office to the boiler room, from the workshops to the residential area. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, everyone was united, the entire factory was energetic. Revolution was booming, production was thriving!

Look! The proletarian revolutionary faction took the lead, standing at the forefront of revolution and production. After the seizure of power, the entire factory had twenty-three revolutionary organizations, twenty-three minds, and twenty-three abacuses. Large organizations' leaders had "hearts of annexation, no intention of unity"; small organizations' leaders "preferred to be kings of small countries, not subjects of large countries." Chairman Mao said, "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest." They overcame selfishness, removed factionalism, and based on Mao Zedong Thought, achieved great unity in February 11 last year, according to systems and departments. More than 90% of the cadres were quickly liberated, and the proletarian revolutionary faction led all workers in the factory to bravely shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production. At that time, there was a batch of foreign orders that needed to be completed urgently. However, the factory did not have the equipment to produce these products. To produce or not? To produce would require importing machinery worth 1.2 million yuan, which would take three years to arrive; not to produce would let the foreigners, who had deliberately paid in advance, laugh at China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The proletarian revolutionary faction said, "Our Factory Nine is determined to make Chairman Mao proud, to add glory to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to give the foreign bosses a lesson!" They did not worship foreign things, dared to think and act, using scrap materials, spending only over ten thousand yuan, and in one month, they made a new set of equipment, completing the foreign order ahead of time, giving the foreign class enemies a resounding slap, giving the capitalist roaders within the factory a heavy blow, and greatly encouraging all revolutionary workers in the factory.

Under the leadership and help of the proletarian revolutionary faction, the masses who had once been deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line also turned around and joined the "grasp revolution, promote production" battlefield. Old worker Chen Jiabao initially stood on the wrong side and was criticized. He felt estranged from the revolutionary rebels emotionally. Even his former colleague Li Changqi, who had worked with him, was seen as an enemy, and they would feel itchy just seeing each other. Li Changqi took the initiative to talk to him, saying, "We both come from poor families, we are two bitter gourds from the same vine. In the past, I didn't listen to Chairman Mao's words well, and I did too much to you. We both suffered from the bourgeois reactionary line." The two talked more and more warmly, their efforts combined into one, and enemies became good comrades again. The two became red, and the entire factory became red. Soon, 93% of the revolutionary workers in the factory joined the revolutionary rebel faction. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line filled the gap between the proletarian revolutionary faction and the deceived masses. The deceived masses said, "In the past, I wouldn't admit this debt! This time I know I was wrong. After turning this big corner, my heart is full of warmth, and now I see the revolutionary rebels and feel happy!"

In the face of the good situation across the factory, the members of the revolutionary committee were sober-minded, with a high stance, often holding doorstep rectification meetings, closely connecting with the masses. In August last year, a production team of eleven people had eight sick and absent. The revolutionary committee members, upon hearing this news, immediately went out in full force to replace them. The committee members held a meeting for a day and participated in a shift of work, staying up for two days and nights without sleep. An old worker said, "I counted, not a single committee member was missing. In seventeen years, I've never seen such good leaders!" The next day, except for a few seriously ill workers, all workers in this production team returned to work. This incident had a great impact on the committee members. From then on, they established a system: three days of labor, two days of investigation, and one day of study per week, unyielding. Every time we talked to the committee members, we had to run through the workshops to find them. They wore work clothes, covered in fluff, hands oily, making it hard to tell if they were workers or cadres.

The surging tide of "grasp revolution, promote production" across the factory also spread to the previously stagnant residential area. From the white-haired grandmothers to the four or five-year-old children, everyone came out, fiercely attacking the "private" nest, setting up family study classes and bedhead criticism columns. In the past, some workers went home to sleep, not studying Chairman Mao's works; now, even lying down to study, four or five-year-old children could criticize them for not being loyal to Chairman Mao. The family members also responded to Chairman Mao's call to "thrift for revolution," using a handful of soil and a handful of sweat to change stoves and save coal, supporting production. In the hot summer, they worked for a week straight, changing the stoves of over six hundred households in the residential area. They also spread the benefits of saving coal everywhere. Five women in their fifties and sixties sang a fast-paced tune they composed:

Don't look down on coal, it has endless uses;
Weaving nylon, generating electricity, driving trains nationwide;
Installing fire-resistant furnaces in every home, saving twenty thousand tons a year;
Changing stoves saves coal, revolution in thought is the key!

After hearing their propaganda, we came to Zhang Tan's grandmother's house. Just in time to see her cooking, we saw with our own eyes that she used less than a kilogram of coal to steam more than ten kilograms of corn flour buns, and the buns were slightly burnt! The seventy-plus-year-old grandmother happily told us, "Our family of eleven used to burn over four hundred kilograms of coal a month, now I listen to Chairman Mao's words, and we only need seventy-five kilograms a month. People from Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, and Heilongjiang came to visit us!"

How did Factory Nine unify under Chairman Mao's revolutionary line? During our third visit to Factory Nine, the responsible comrades of the factory revolutionary committee told us, "The most important thing is, under the help of the stationed soldiers, to greatly establish Mao Zedong Thought and hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes."

Factory Nine started holding study classes in June last year. Now, everyone in the factory has participated in at least three sessions. They said, "In the past, the capitalist roaders never organized us to study Chairman Mao's works well. Now it's good! The study class is like a big furnace, melting away our selfish thoughts, forging our loyalty to Chairman Mao, guiding us to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments step by step." Old worker Duan Shuxing stood on the wrong side during the movement and couldn't bear the criticism from the masses, crying at home. She said to Mao's portrait, "Chairman Mao, my thoughts are at a dead end, save me!" In the study class, Chairman Mao's teachings were like a golden key, opening her mind. She cried excitedly to Mao's portrait again, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It was China's Khrushchev who deceived me, almost making me leave you. Now I'm back, the study class really saved me!" Duan Shuxing, having lived so long, rarely sang songs and rarely spoke at meetings. Now she is the most active in speaking, often singing and dancing in the workshops and canteens, using artistic forms to praise the great leader Chairman Mao, and fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev, making many people moved to tears. She said, "Now I've forgotten the wrinkles on my face, I'm so happy!"

Factory Nine, according to the development of the situation and actual needs, held various types of study classes. To better implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions in a timely manner, they recently held a short-term study class. When Chairman Mao pointed out that the "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, it is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang reactionaries led by the broad revolutionary masses, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie," the revolutionary committee immediately, in response to the complacency and negligence among the masses, first organized the cadres to study seriously for three days. They broke the routine, did not give big speeches, did not hold big summaries, focusing on inspiring everyone to understand the spirit of Chairman Mao's latest instructions word by word, then talked about the factory's history and analyzed the enemy situation, quickly making everyone's eyes clear and enhancing their class struggle awareness. Some said, "In the past, I thought all class enemies had been dragged out, and there was nothing to fight. Now I know that our struggle with the class enemies will continue for a long time." Some said, "In the past, I was deaf, blind, and heartless towards the enemy, now I am clear-minded, sharp-eyed, and full of fighting spirit." Everyone decided to continue the fight, dragging out all the remaining Kuomintang remnants, and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. From then on, short-term study classes sprouted like bamboo after rain, becoming more and more in the factory. They said, "This way of studying Mao Zedong Thought is the most effective, holding one short-term study class is like a timely political rain." They summarized the advantages of this study class as: clear guiding ideology, closely combined with the situation, accurately grasping living thoughts, studying few but essential documents, studying for a short time, and solving problems in a timely manner. In short, making everyone follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line more closely.

The thriving scene of Factory Nine made us think deeply. Across the country, how many factories, how many villages are advancing like Factory Nine! If a day of production progress is equal to twenty years, then in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the progress of people's thoughts in one day is unknown how many years! "The people's revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of historical progress." The new people created by the great Mao Zedong Thought are driving the wheels of history forward at a rapid pace! Forward with great strides!

    三访九厂
    田忠　李红　齐夫一
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，全国最早建立革命委员会的地方之一——胶州湾畔的青岛市，我们访问了一个几千人的纺织工厂。
    这个厂，在全市九个纺织厂中排行第九，名叫“国棉九厂”。解放前它叫“华新”。别看它名字叫得好听，其实又破又旧，既不“新”、也不“华”，机器老掉了牙，生产象蜗牛爬。厂里设备有一九一二年的英国货，一九一三年的德国货，还有二十年代的日本货、美国货、西班牙货，全是一堆破烂货。解放后虽然改装和增添了一些机器，但和全市、全国比，仍旧很落后。设备旧，人也旧。文化大革命前，一个清朝两广总督的四代重孙掌握着它的财经大权，一个资产阶级分子掌握着它的行政大权。在厂里，国民党的接收大员、黄色工会的骨干分子、特务分子、封建把头混在职工队伍之中，鱼龙混杂。人们说，“华新”过去是个“大染缸”、“大油锅”，进了这个厂，红的能染成黑的，小青年也能“炸成老油条”。这个厂是帝国主义侵略者办的，封建官僚买的，官僚资本家接的。三座大山被推翻以后，党内的走资派又包下的。所以，它一直是个老落后，在全市九个纺织厂当中成了名副其实的老九，如果拿到全国比，就可能是九九——八十一了！有的工人嫌国棉九厂这个“九”字不吉利，提到“九”字就眉头皱。他们说，要扔掉这顶落后帽子，非得改个厂名不可。
    文化大革命一声炮响，九厂的无产阶级革命派在去年一月二十日一举夺下全厂党政财文大权，把走资派等一小撮阶级敌人揪了出来。他们说：“什么‘九’字不吉利！？我们不靠天，不靠地，有了毛泽东思想，天是我们的天，地是我们的地，定叫烂摊子里出奇迹，老末变第一！”就在夺权当天，一个严重问题摆在新生的革命委员会面前：全月已经过了二十天，生产计划才完成一半。走资派在暗中窃笑，逍遥派在全厂瞎跑，革命派在紧张思考：怎么办？怎么办？厂革命委员会突出无产阶级政治，狠抓根本，首先召开了誓师大会，发给全厂革命职工每人三件宝：一套四卷宝书，一枚毛主席像章，一尊毛主席塑像，号召大家以“抓革命，促生产”的丰硕成果，向伟大领袖毛主席报喜。大家手捧三件宝，面对毛主席像庄严宣誓：“毛主席啊，毛主席！您支持咱夺了权，咱一定给您争气！”他们说到做到，不放空炮。全厂革命职工，挺起腰杆，昼夜奋战。只九天，就完成全月计划剩下的一半，一月份完成了全月计划的百分之一百零一点六，打响了第一炮！从此，计划月月超额，生产直线上升；从蜗牛似的爬行，到大踏步的前进，老末一跃成了上游！在全国扳着手指头也数得着。
    九厂翻身展新容。你看，车间里“喷云吐雾”，梭如流星，机器吞进成包的棉花，吐出成捆的布匹。五彩缤纷的花布高挂在印染机上，象瀑布似的飞流直下三千丈！工人们指着各种畅销国内外的新产品，兴奋地对我们说：“别看我们厂子老，支援世界革命贡献决不能小！”我们放眼望去，只见车间里毛主席语录牌和标语牌琳琅满目，革命大批判专栏星罗棋布。工人们个个胸前印着鲜红鲜红“无限忠于毛主席”的大字，显示着他们对毛主席的耿耿忠心。革命大批判的烈火熊熊燃烧，表现了他们对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨。看到这派生气勃勃的革命景象，一个向地方左派学习、拜工人群众为师的强烈愿望吸引着我们。可是时间晚了，我们确定改日再访九厂。二
    再访九厂。我们从办公室到锅炉房，从车间到家属区，访问了各种人员。他们在毛主席革命路线的指引下，上下一条心，全厂一股劲。抓革命轰轰烈烈，促生产热气腾腾！
    请看！无产阶级革命派一马当先，站在革命、生产第一线。夺权后，全厂二十三个革命组织，二十三个心眼，二十三把算盘。大组织的头头“有吞并之心，无联合之意”；小组织的头头“宁当小国之君，不当大国之臣”。毛主席说：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。”他们经过斗私心，搬山头，在毛泽东思想的基础上，去年二月十一日，就按系统、按部门实现了革命大联合，百分之九十以上干部迅速得到解放，无产阶级革命派带领全厂职工，勇敢地挑起了革命、生产两副重担。那时，有一批国外定货急需完成。可是厂里没有生产这种产品的设备。干不干？干，就得进口一百二十万元的机器，三年才能运来；不干，外国人故意提前付了款，妄想看我国无产阶级文化大革命的笑话。无产阶级革命派说：“俺九厂决心为毛主席争气，为无产阶级文化大革命增光，给外国老板一点颜色看看！”他们不崇洋迷外，敢想敢干，利用废料旧料，只花了一万多元，一个月就造出了一套新设备，提前完成了定货任务，给国外阶级敌人一个响亮耳光，给厂内走资派一个沉重打击，给全厂革命职工一个极大振奋！
    在无产阶级革命派带领和帮助下，曾经一度受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的群众，也纷纷反戈一击，杀上了“抓革命，促生产”的战场。老工人陈家宝开始站错了队，受了批评，在感情上和革命造反派格格不入。就连过去和他一道工作的好朋友李长起，也看作冤家对头，照面就觉得牙根直痒痒，见了面，低着头，绕道走。李长起主动找他谈心说：“咱俩都是苦出身，是一根藤上的俩苦瓜，过去俺没好好听毛主席的话，对你也做得过分了，咱都受了资产阶级反动路线的害。咱要恨中国赫鲁晓夫和他推行的资产阶级反动路线！”两人越说越亲热，两股劲拧成了一股绳，冤家又成了好战友。两人红一线、全厂红一片，很快全厂百分之九十三的革命职工都参加了革命造反派。毛主席的革命路线把无产阶级革命派和受蒙蔽群众之间的一道鸿沟填平了。受蒙蔽的群众说：“从前俺才不认这份酒钱哩！这回才知道过去自己错了。转过这个大弯，俺心眼里热气直往外滚，这会儿看到革命造反派真喜人哪！” 
    在全厂一片大好形势下，革命委员会的同志们头脑清醒，姿态高屋建瓴，经常开门整风，紧密联系群众。去年八月，一个生产小组十一个人有八个生病缺勤。革委会的同志听到这个消息，立即全体出动，顶班劳动。委员们开了一天会，又参加了一班劳动，连续两天一夜没合眼。有的老工人感动地说：“俺数了数，委员一个也不少。十七年来还没见过这样的好领导哩！”第二天这个生产小组的工人，除了个别重病号以外，都坚持上了班。这件事对革委会的同志启发很大，从此，常委定出一个制度：每周三天劳动，两天调查，一天学习，雷打不动。我们每次找常委的同志谈话，都要跑遍车间才能找到。他们穿着工作服，满身花絮，双手油腻，很难看出是工人还是干部。
    全厂“抓革命，促生产”的滚滚热浪，也波及到了“死水一潭”的家属区。从白发苍苍的老大娘到四、五岁的小娃娃，全都杀将出来，猛抄“私”字老窝，大办家属学习班、炕头批判栏。过去有的工人回家睡大觉，不学毛主席著作；现在就连躺着学习，四、五岁的孩子也会批判他不忠于毛主席。家属们还响应毛主席“节约闹革命”的号召，一把土，一把汗地改灶节煤，支援生产。大热天，他们连着干了一个星期，硬把家属区六百多户炉灶改了过来。他们还到处宣传节约煤的好处，五个五、六十岁的老妈妈唱起自己编的快板：
    别看煤炭不好看，它的用处大无边；
    织尼龙，能发电，开着火车全国转；
    耐火炉膛家家安，全年能省二万三；
    修改炉灶省煤炭，思想革命是关键！
    听了她们的宣传，我们来到张谭氏老妈妈家。正赶上她做饭，我们亲眼看到她用不到一斤煤就蒸熟了十多斤玉米面的窝窝头，窝窝头上还带着黄焦巴呢！七十多岁的老妈妈高兴地告诉我们：“俺十一口之家，过去每月要烧四百多斤煤，如今俺听毛主席的话，每月只要七十五斤就够了。连宁夏、内蒙古、黑龙江都有人到俺这儿来参观哩！”
    九厂的同志在无产阶级文化大革命这场急风暴雨当中，就这样一天也没有停止过斗私批修，一小时也没有停止过生产。全厂上下、各行各业、各种人员，犹如千支经纬在织布机上紧密地编织在一起，统一了思想、统一了意志、统一了行动、统一了步伐，真正统一在毛主席革命路线的伟大红旗下！三  九厂是怎样在毛主席的革命路线上统一起来的呢？我们第三次访问九厂的时候，厂革委会的负责同志对我们说：“最重要的一条，就是在驻厂解放军同志帮助下，大立毛泽东思想，大办毛泽东思想学习班。”
    九厂从去年六月就开始办学习班，现在全厂每人至少参加了三期以上。他们说：“过去走资派从来不组织我们好好学习毛主席著作，这下可好了！学习班象个大熔炉，熔掉了我们的私心杂念，炼出来我们对毛主席的赤胆忠心，引着我们步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。”老工人段淑英在运动中一度站错了队，经不住群众的批评，回家直哭。她对着毛主席像说：“毛主席啊！俺思想走投无路啦，您救救俺吧！”在学习班里，毛主席的教导象金钥匙，打开了她的心窍。她又对着毛主席像激动地哭起来：“毛主席啊，毛主席！都是中国赫鲁晓夫那个大坏蛋把俺骗了，让俺差点儿离开了您。现在俺又回来啦，学习班可真把俺救了！”段淑英活了那么大，很少唱歌，开会也很少发言。现在她发言最积极，还经常在车间、食堂里又唱又跳，用文艺形式歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫，使很多人感动得流下眼泪。她说：“这会儿俺都忘了脸上的曲曲纹啦，俺就那么痛快，就那么高兴！”毛泽东思想学习班使多少个段淑英这样受蒙蔽的群众，回到了毛主席的革命路线上来。
    九厂根据形势发展，根据实际需要，办的学习班有各种类型。为了更加及时地贯彻落实毛主席的每一条最新指示，前不久他们又办了一种短期学习班。当毛主席指出“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”，革命委员会立即针对群众中的轻敌麻痹情绪，先组织骨干扎扎实实学习了三天。他们打破常规，不做大报告，不搞大总结，着重启发大家一字一句领会毛主席最新指示的精神，然后讲厂史、摆敌情，很快就使大家擦亮了眼睛，增强了阶级斗争观念。有的说：“过去俺还以为阶级敌人都揪出了，没啥好斗的了。现在才知道，我们和阶级敌人的斗争还要长期继续下去。”有的人说：“过去对敌人是耳聋、眼花、心不狠，现在是心明、眼亮、斗志高。”大家决心再接再厉，把隐藏的国民党残渣余孽统统挖出来，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。从此，短期学习班象雨后春笋，在全厂越办越多。他们说：“这样学习毛泽东思想最管用，办一期短期学习班，等于下了一场政治及时雨。”他们总结这种学习班的好处是：指导思想明确，结合形势紧密，活思想抓得准，学习文件少而精，学习时间短而少，解决问题最及时。一句话，使大家跟毛主席的革命路线跟得更紧。
    九厂生气蓬勃的兴旺景象，使我们浮想联翩。在全国，有多少个工厂，多少个农村，象九厂这样在阔步前进啊！如果说生产的跃进一天可以等于二十年，那么，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，人们思想的跃进一天就不知要等于多少年了！“毛泽东思想指引下的人民革命是历史前进的火车头。”伟大的毛泽东思想造就的一代新人，正带动着历史的巨轮，滚滚向前！迅猛向前！（载七月二十二日《解放军报》）
