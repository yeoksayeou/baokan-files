The broad masses of revolutionaries are resolved to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smash the revisionist educational and scientific lines, and resolutely take the path of cultivating technical personnel from among workers.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out deeply: "Universities must still be run. Here I am mainly talking about technical and scientific universities. The system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should take command. Follow the path of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among workers. Select students from workers and peasants with practical experience, let them study in school for a few years, and then return to production practice."

New China News Agency, July 24: At this critical moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great leader Chairman Mao has issued a historic call to the revolutionary people of the entire country: "Universities must still be run. Here I am mainly talking about technical and scientific universities. The system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should take command. Follow the path of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among workers. Select students from workers and peasants with practical experience, let them study in school for a few years, and then return to production practice."

After more than two years of tempering in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses, revolutionary scientific and technical personnel, and revolutionary intellectuals in schools across the country enthusiastically hailed Chairman Mao's great instructions, which once again pointed out the direction for their advance. They expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational and scientific lines, carry out the proletarian educational revolution and scientific and technological revolution to the end, resolutely follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, temper and transform themselves in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, serve the people wholeheartedly, and better serve proletarian politics.

The "Path of Cultivating Technical Personnel from Among Workers" Indicated by Chairman Mao Is the Only Correct and Bright Road for Forging a Proletarian Scientific and Technical Team

Revolutionary intellectuals and revolutionary engineering and technical personnel across the country, while repeatedly studying the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, enthusiastically praised the "path of cultivating technical personnel from among workers" indicated by Chairman Mao as the only correct and bright road for forging a proletarian scientific and technical team! They unanimously expressed their determination to use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a sharp weapon to thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational and scientific lines of China's Khrushchev, drive the reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie off the stage, and let the "most experienced warriors" who are absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao grasp the power of science and technology, creating conditions for our country's new industrial revolution.

The revolutionary workers of the Shenyang Smelting Plant, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, rose up to overthrow a handful of capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities," seizing their power. Revolutionary workers used Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything and achieved technical achievements in one or two years that had not been achieved in the past ten years. In the past, the capitalist roaders in this plant relied on reactionary technical "authorities," detached from reality, and conducted a so-called "experiment" that failed after several years, wasting more than twenty million yuan of state funds. During the Cultural Revolution, the workers followed Chairman Mao's teachings of "resolving to overcome all difficulties and win victory," took matters into their own hands, conducted design and experimentation, and achieved significant results in technological transformation in a short period. The engineering and technical personnel of this plant, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, excitedly said that the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought has boundless wisdom and creativity, which eloquently proves that the "path of cultivating technical personnel from among workers" indicated by Chairman Mao is extremely wise and correct. Chairman Mao's latest instructions are a major development of Marxism-Leninism in an epoch-making sense, and their great and far-reaching significance has not only been proven by the practice of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory but also by the great changes that have taken place in our plant during the Cultural Revolution.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of the Shijiazhuang Dyeing and Finishing Plant drove the capitalist roaders and some reactionary technical "authorities" off the stage, achieving double victories in revolution and production, turning the production capacity of one plant into one and a half plants. In the past, the reactionary technical "authorities" of this plant spent more than ten years and more than twenty thousand yuan of funds but still failed to develop the effective washing machine. This time, the workers and revolutionary technical personnel and cadres together only took more than twenty days to successfully develop it. The technical personnel of this plant deeply felt that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the guiding light for the educational revolution and also the guiding light for the industrial revolution.

A deputy chief engineer of the Benxi Mining Bureau, originally a graduate of a secondary specialized school, has always insisted on the path of combining with workers and made contributions to the cause of socialist construction. He said that in the past, under the protection of China's Khrushchev's revisionist scientific line, some bourgeois technical "authorities" monopolized the power of science and technology. Despite this, the workers still broke through countless obstacles and created many miracles that the bourgeois philistines and right-wing conservatives could not have imagined. Workers with practical experience are the smartest and most talented; they should be the masters of science and technology.

The young technical personnel of the Guangzhou Chemical Industry Research Institute, while studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, reviewed the path this institute has taken over the past ten years. They have researched dozens of topics over the past ten years. Those that relied solely on "experts" and "authorities" all failed; those that succeeded were all due to the combination of technical personnel with the workers and peasants. They said that ironclad facts eloquently prove that intellectuals, if they do not combine with the workers and peasants, will achieve nothing. The young scientific workers of the Xinjiang Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences excitedly said in a discussion that Chairman Mao's latest instructions hit the spot for us young scientific workers, and we feel close to them. They unanimously expressed their determination to use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon to thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist scientific line and let Chairman Mao's revolutionary line firmly occupy the scientific research front.

Under the Guidance of Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions, Establish a New Proletarian Educational System

While studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary teachers and students across the country emphasized that the "select students from workers and peasants with practical experience, let them study in school for a few years, and then return to production practice" proposed by Chairman Mao is the fundamental direction of the proletarian educational revolution. We must demolish the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the schools and open the doors of universities wide to the workers and peasants.

The responsible persons of the Red Guards' Congress of Shanghai's colleges and universities and secondary schools said with fighting passion that the publication of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on educational revolution heralds the arrival of a new high tide of the proletarian educational revolution. We, the youth of the Mao Zedong era, will, under the personal command of the great leader Chairman Mao, thoroughly smash the educational system of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes and create a brilliant proletarian educational system unprecedented in human history.

The revolutionary teachers and students of Qinghai Medical College and Henan Yubei Medical College deeply felt the correctness and wisdom of Chairman Mao's latest instructions from their practice of trial-run half-agricultural and half-medical training classes and Antu-style medical schools. The students they enrolled are all from poor and lower-middle peasants, and after studying, they return to the poor and lower-middle peasants. These students, with their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao and their red hearts of serving the poor and lower-middle peasants wholeheartedly, study diligently and have basically mastered the knowledge of preventing and treating common rural diseases in just one year. The revolutionary teachers and students of these two medical schools expressed their determination to carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, and strive to cultivate more medical workers of poor and lower-middle peasant origin.

Many revolutionary teachers and students of the Civil Engineering Department of Zhejiang University have, in the past half year, gone to the construction site to learn from the workers, insisting on eating, living, and working with the workers, and criticizing China's Khrushchev together with the workers. Not only have they made great progress in their thoughts, but they have also quickly mastered the construction techniques. Through practice, they boldly proposed a plan to reduce the original curriculum by one-third to two-thirds and shorten the school system from five years to three years. They are determined to explore along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao and create new achievements for the educational revolution.

Many schools across the country have, in the light of Chairman Mao's latest instructions of "select students from workers and peasants with practical experience," angrily exposed and denounced the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev in promoting the revisionist educational line and expelling and persecuting worker and peasant students. The revolutionary teachers and students of the Shandong Provincial Mechanical Industry School denounced that in the past, under the strong demand of revolutionary teachers and students, this school had enrolled a batch of students from workers. However, the agents of China's Khrushchev in the school discriminated against and harassed these worker students in every possible way, even unreasonably ordering them to drop out, resulting in the school completely closing its doors to workers. The revolutionary teachers and students of the Chemistry Department of Northeast People's University denounced that in 1960, our department enrolled nine transferred cadres, most of whom were from worker and peasant families and had some practical experience. However, due to the stubborn implementation of the revisionist educational line by the capitalist roaders in the school, these students were harassed in every possible way and seven of them were eventually expelled. They said that they would definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, thoroughly smash the bourgeois educational system, and carry out the educational revolution to the end.

While studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary teachers and students and revolutionary intellectuals across the country reviewed Chairman Mao's great teachings: "The final dividing line between revolutionary and non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing to and actually combine with the workers and peasants." They expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions and consistent teachings, resolutely take the path of combining with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, achieve ideological revolutionization, and temper themselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The members of the Revolutionary Committee and the representatives of revolutionary teachers and students of various colleges and universities in Hefei, Anhui, held a study and discussion meeting today. They said that the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers indicated by Chairman Mao is a path of revolutionization for intellectuals, which has extremely far-reaching significance for cultivating successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and ensuring that the socialist mountains will never change color. Chairman Mao's latest instructions have pointed out the inevitable path of revolutionization for the broad revolutionary youth and revolutionary intellectuals, and we firmly support and resolutely implement them.

The revolutionary teachers and students of the Jiangxi Communist Labor University established in rural areas, the Jiangxi University Rujin Branch, and the Jiangxi Water Conservancy and Electric Power School, which has done a good job in on-site education, with their own personal experiences, denounced the reactionary fallacy of "reading books to become officials" advocated by China's Khrushchev. They said that only by taking the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers and learning from workers and poor and lower-middle peasants can one temper a red heart that is absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, highlight proletarian politics, learn real knowledge, achieve ideological revolutionization, and prevent falling into the quagmire of revisionism. The revolutionary teachers and students of the Hubei College of Traditional Chinese Medicine summarized their experiences of organizing medical service teams to go to the mountains and countryside according to Chairman Mao's teachings. They said that going to the countryside and going to the mines to learn from workers and poor and lower-middle peasants greatly enhanced proletarian awareness, strengthened the feelings of the working people, and the level of medical technology was universally improved. We deeply feel that the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers indicated by Chairman Mao is infinitely bright and extremely correct.

The knowledge youth construction team fighting in Cangbian Brigade of Luoyuan Commune, Lianjiang County, Fujian, studied and discussed Chairman Mao's latest instructions during the summer harvest battle. A leader of the volunteer team said: Six years ago, when I first came to the countryside from school, I was a typical weak scholar. In the past few years, under the nurturing of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, I have taken the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, established a deep class feeling with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and gained their trust. I deeply feel that knowledge youth must actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call, live with workers and peasants, and have a great future. Some students of the Class of 1962 of the Mechanical Engineering Department of Hunan University, who had practiced in the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, said: Intellectuals must put down their airs, humbly learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers, strengthen ideological remolding, and catch up with the rapidly developing revolutionary situation.

The revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Agricultural University expressed their determination to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, take the university to the countryside, take it to the five hundred million peasants, and carry out the proletarian educational revolution to the end. They will be peasants for life, remold their thoughts for life, and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life.

With Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions as a Weapon, Thoroughly Criticize and Denounce the Revisionist Educational and Scientific Lines

The revolutionary teachers and students and technical personnel across the country, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings of "criticize first, establish later," launched a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. They are determined to use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon to thoroughly smash China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational and scientific lines.

More than fifty research technical personnel of the Guangzhou Textile Industry Research Institute, ninety percent of whom are young graduates from colleges and universities after liberation, are all from the home gate to the school gate and then from the school gate to the research department, rarely going to the factory, and rarely contacting the workers and production practice. While studying and discussing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they angrily denounced the harm of China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational and scientific lines to them. They said that they are determined to smash the old educational and scientific systems, determined to catch up with the majestic steps of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers for tempering, and be the little students of the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The revolutionary teachers and students of China Medical University, while studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, angrily exposed and denounced the crimes of China's Khrushchev in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line in this university. This university has an eight-year system, resulting in three years without touching medical science, five years without touching clinical practice, and eight years without touching workers, peasants, and soldiers, which is a genuine model of wasting talents, wasting youth, and carrying out capitalist restoration. Many students who graduated from here cannot treat the common diseases of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the countryside, truly the more books they read, the more stupid they become. The revolutionary teachers and students said that Chairman Mao's latest instructions have pointed out the direction for our advance and further strengthened our confidence and determination to go to the countryside to run schools and take the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers. We must take the path of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, turning the school into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The revolutionary teachers and students and scientific and technical personnel across the country, through in-depth criticism and denunciation, have greatly enhanced their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, and have unanimously put Chairman Mao's latest instructions into action. Many colleges and universities have prepared their luggage, ready to go to the mountains and countryside to labor as soon as the motherland calls. Many scientific and technical personnel have also gone to the workshops and teams, deeply into the front lines of class struggle and production struggle, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the workers. They firmly expressed: Chairman Mao instructs me to follow, Chairman Mao waves his hand, and I advance!

    广大革命群众决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    彻底粉碎修正主义教育路线、科技路线
    坚决走从工人中培养技术人员的道路
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”
    新华社二十四日讯　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，伟大领袖毛主席向全国革命人民发出了具有历史意义的伟大号召：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”经过两年多无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的各地广大革命群众、革命科学技术人员和学校中的革命知识分子，热烈欢呼毛主席的伟大指示又一次为他们指明了前进的道路。他们表示，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判修正主义教育路线和科技路线，把无产阶级教育革命和科学技术革命进行到底，坚决走毛主席指引的同工农兵结合的道路，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中锻炼和改造自己，全心全意为人民服务，更好地为无产阶级政治服务。
      毛主席指引的“从工人中培养技术
  人员的道路”是造就无产阶级科技队伍
    唯一正确的光明大道
    全国各地工厂企业和科技战线上的广大革命知识分子与广大革命工程技术人员，在反复学习伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的时候，以自己切身经历的大量生动事例，热烈赞颂毛主席所指引的“从工人中培养技术人员的道路”，是造就无产阶级科技队伍唯一正确的光明大道！他们一致表示，一定要以毛主席的最新指示为锐利武器，彻底粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线和科技路线，把资产阶级反动“权威”赶下台，让无限忠于毛主席的“最有实践经验的战士”掌握科技大权，为我国新的工业革命创造条件。
    沈阳冶炼厂广大革命职工，在无产阶级文化大革命中，起来造了一小撮走资派和反动技术“权威”的反，夺了他们的权。革命职工用毛泽东思想统帅一切，一两年内就取得了过去十几年所没有取得的技术成就。过去这个厂走资派重用反动技术“权威”，脱离实际，搞一项所谓的“试验”，搞了好些年都失败了，白白浪费了国家二十多万元资金。在文化大革命中，工人们遵照毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，自己动手，进行设计和试验，在很短的时间内就取得了技术改造的重大成果。这个厂的工程技术人员学习了毛主席的最新指示，兴奋地说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级有着无穷的智慧和创造力，雄辩地证明毛主席指引的“从工人中培养技术人员的道路”，无比英明，无比正确。毛主席的最新指示是马克思列宁主义划时代的重大发展，它的伟大而深远的意义不仅已为上海机床厂的实践所证明，也为我们厂在文化大革命中所发生的伟大变革所证明。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，石家庄印染厂革命职工把走资派和一些反动技术“权威”赶下了台，夺得了革命、生产双胜利，把一个厂的生产能力变成了一个半厂。过去这个厂的反动技术“权威”用了十多年的时间，花了两万多元资金，始终没有搞成的加效水洗机，这次工人和革命技术人员、革命干部一道，只用了二十多天时间就试制成功。这个厂的技术人员深有体会地说，毛主席的最新指示是教育革命的指路明灯，也是工业革命的指路明灯。
    本溪矿务局一位副总工程师，原来是中等专业学校的毕业生，由于他一直坚持走和工人结合的道路，为社会主义建设事业作出了贡献。他说，过去，在中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义科技路线的庇护下，一些资产阶级技术“权威”垄断了技术大权。尽管这样，工人们还是冲破重重阻力，创造了许多为资产阶级庸人和右倾保守主义者所意想不到的奇迹。有实践经验的工人最聪明，最有才能，他们应该成为科学技术的主人。
    广州市化学工业研究所的青年技术人员在学习毛主席的最新指示时，回顾了这个所十年来所走的道路。他们十年来研究了几十个课题，凡是仅仅依靠“专家”、“权威”的，都遭到了失败；凡是获得成功的，都是由于技术人员同工农群众相结合的结果。他们说，铁的事实雄辩地说明，知识分子如果不同工农群众相结合，将一事无成。中国科学院新疆分院的青年科学工作者在座谈中兴奋地说，毛主席的最新指示句句说到了我们青年科学工作者的心坎里，我们感到亲切。他们一致表示，一定要以毛主席的最新指示为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义科技路线，让毛主席的革命路线牢牢地占领科研阵地。
      在毛主席最新指示的指引下
        创建崭新的无产阶级教育制度
    各地广大革命师生在认真学习毛主席最新指示的时候，大家强调地说，毛主席提出的“要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去”，这是无产阶级教育革命的根本方向。我们一定要摧毁资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象，让大学彻底地向工农群众敞开大门。
    上海市大专院校红代会和中等学校红代会负责人满怀着战斗的激情说，伟大领袖毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示的发表，预示着无产阶级教育大革命的新高潮将要到来。我们毛泽东时代的青年一代，将在伟大领袖毛主席的亲自统帅下，彻底摧毁资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的教育制度，创造出人类历史上前所未有的光辉的无产阶级教育制度。
    青海大学医学院和河南豫北医专的革命师生，从他们试办的半农半医训练班和抗大式医校的实践中，深深体会到毛主席的最新指示无比正确，无比英明。他们吸收的学员，都是从贫下中农中来，学习后又回到贫下中农中去。这些学员怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚和全心全意为贫下中农服务的红心，刻苦学习，只经过一年时间就基本上掌握了农村常见疾病的防治知识。这两个医科学校的革命师生表示，一定要发扬无产阶级彻底革命精神，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，为培养出更多的贫下中农出身的农村红色医务工作者而奋斗。
    浙江大学土木系的许多革命师生，近半年来到工地拜工人为师，坚持和工人同吃、同住、同劳动，和工人一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫，不但思想有很大进步，而且很快掌握了施工技术。经过实践，他们大胆地提出了将原来的课程设置缩减三分之一到三分之二，学制由五年缩减为三年的方案。他们决心沿着毛主席指引的方向，勇敢探索，为教育革命立新功。
    各地许多学校的革命师生，对照毛主席“要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生”的最新指示，愤怒地揭发和控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫推行修正主义教育路线，排挤和打击工农学生的滔天罪行。山东省机械工业学校的革命师生控诉说，过去，在革命师生的强烈要求下，这个学校曾从工人中招收了一批学生。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫在学校的代理人对这些工人学生百般歧视和刁难，甚至无理勒令他们退学，结果使学校对工人完全关上了大门。东北人民大学化学系革命师生控诉说，一九六○年我们系招收了九名调干学生，他们多数都是出身于工农家庭，有一定的实践经验。可是，由于校内走资派顽固地推行修正主义教育路线，百般刁难这些学生，先后被排挤出去七名。他们说，我们一定遵循毛主席的教导，彻底砸烂资产阶级教育制度，把教育革命进行到底。
      在毛主席的最新指示指引下
        坚决走同工农兵结合的道路
    各地广大革命师生、革命知识分子在学习毛主席的最新指示的时候，重温了毛主席的伟大教导：“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”他们表示，一定要遵照毛主席的最新指示和一贯教导，坚决走同工农兵群众结合的道路，实现思想革命化，把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    安徽合肥地区各高等院校革委会成员和革命师生代表，今天在一起举行了学习座谈会。他们说，毛主席指出的与工农兵相结合的道路，是一条知识分子革命化的道路，它对于培养无产阶级革命事业接班人，巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，保证社会主义江山永不变色，有着极其深远的意义。毛主席的最新指示，给广大革命青年、革命知识分子指出了革命化的必由之路，我们坚决拥护，坚决照办。
    建立在农村的江西共产主义劳动大学、江西大学瑞金分校以及在工地办学比较好的江西水利电力学校的革命师生们，以自己的亲身体会，痛斥了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“读书做官”的反动谬论。他们说，只有走与工农兵相结合的道路，拜工人、贫下中农为师，才能锤炼出一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，突出无产阶级政治，学到真正的知识，实现思想革命化，防止滑入修正主义的泥坑。湖北中医学院革命师生总结了他们遵照毛主席的教导，组织医疗服务队上山下乡的体会。他们说，到农村去，到工矿去，向工人和贫下中农学习，大大提高了无产阶级觉悟，增强了劳动人民的感情，医疗技术水平也普遍提高了。我们深深感到毛主席指出的与工农兵结合的道路，无限光明，无比正确。
    战斗在福建连江县蓼沿公社莆边大队的知识青年建设山区志愿队，在夏收战斗中学习、讨论了毛主席的最新指示。志愿队一位领导成员说：六年前，我刚从学校来到农村时，是个十足的文弱书生。几年来，在毛主席光辉思想哺育下，走与工农兵相结合的道路，与贫下中农建立了深厚的阶级感情，得到了他们的信任。我深深体会到，知识青年只有积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，同工人农民生活在一起，才大有作为。曾在上海机床厂实习过的湖南大学机械系六二级的部分学生说：知识分子只有放下架子，老老实实向工农兵学习，加强思想改造，才能赶上日益发展的革命形势。
    北京农业大学广大革命师生表示，要坚决执行毛主席的最新指示，把农大办到农村去，办到五亿农民中去，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。要当一辈子农民，改造一辈子思想，紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命。
      以毛主席的最新指示为武器把修正主义教育路线和科技路线批倒批臭
    各地广大革命师生和技术人员学习了毛主席的最新指示，遵照毛主席“破字当头，立在其中”的教导，掀起了革命大批判的新高潮。他们决心以毛主席的最新指示为武器，彻底摧毁中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线和科技路线。
    广州市纺织工业研究所有五十多位研究技术人员，百分之九十是解放以后从大专院校毕业出来的青年。他们都是从家门到学校门，又从学校门到科研部门，很少下厂，很少接触工人群众和生产实际。他们在座谈学习毛主席最新指示时，愤怒控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线和科技路线对他们的毒害。他们说，我们决心砸烂旧的教育制度和科技制度，决心赶上亿万革命人民的雄伟步伐，到工农兵群众中去锻炼，做工农兵的小学生。
    中国医科大学的革命师生在学习毛主席最新指示时，愤怒地揭发和控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫在这所大学推行反革命修正主义教育路线的罪行。这所大学学制八年，结果是三年不沾医学边，五年不沾临床边，八年不沾工农兵，是地地道道的摧残人材，摧残青年，进行资本主义复辟的黑样板。从这里毕业出来的许多学生，到农村治不了贫下中农的常见病，真是书读得越多越蠢。革命师生们说，毛主席的最新指示，给我们指明了前进的方向，更加坚定了我们到农村办学，走与工农兵相结合的道路的信心和决心。我们一定要走抗大的路，把学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    全国各地广大革命师生和科学技术人员，通过深入开展革命的大批判，大大提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，纷纷把毛主席的最新指示落实于行动。许多地方的大中学校应届毕业生，已经准备好行装，只等祖国一声召唤，立即上山下乡劳动。许多科学技术人员也纷纷下车间，到班组，深入阶级斗争和生产斗争第一线，同工人们并肩战斗。他们坚定地表示：毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进！
