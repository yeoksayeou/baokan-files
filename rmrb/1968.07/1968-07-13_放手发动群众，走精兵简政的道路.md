The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative structures, streamline and reduce bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary and people-oriented leadership team." The Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee, following the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, bravely broke out of the old institutional framework, implemented revolutionary leadership, streamlined and reduced bureaucracy, and closely connected with the masses, setting a good example for us.

There are many experiences from Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee's efforts to streamline and reduce bureaucracy that are worth learning from, but the most important is their thorough revolutionary spirit in fully trusting the masses and mobilizing them in the construction of political power.

After the birth of the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee in the "January Revolution" storm, it faced an urgent problem: how to build the new revolutionary committee into a lean and efficient command center in the midst of class struggle. We repeatedly studied the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, determined to break away from the old Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee's overlapping administrative structures, and organize a leadership team that meets the needs of class struggle. At that time, some departments and offices were adjusted and reformed, and the number of staff was reduced by two-thirds compared to before.

The first reform of the administrative structure, although it achieved great results, did not reduce the number of levels in the departments and offices that were merged from the old Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee, and still could not adapt to the new situation of the victory and development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The overlapping administrative structures were like a "wall" between the revolutionary committee and the masses; the more levels there were, the thicker the "wall" became, seriously affecting the close connection between the leadership team and the revolutionary masses. The revolutionary masses urgently demanded that the revolutionary committee implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and take the thorough path of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy.

At this time, some comrades became worried. They were bound by old habits and thought that now one person in the revolutionary committee had to do the work of three people from the old Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee, and if further streamlining was done, some work would "grind to a halt." A handful of class enemies also fanned the flames and stirred up trouble, obstructing and sabotaging the work of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy.

In the construction of political power, should we take the counter-revolutionary revisionist road, or break out of the old institutional framework and take a new revolutionary path? This is a sharp and profound class struggle, and a vigorous revolutionary mass movement must be launched. The broad revolutionary masses listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and care about the construction of the revolutionary committee the most. Only by fully trusting the masses and mobilizing them can we complete the important task of building the revolutionary committee. We seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the construction of revolutionary committees and, with the spirit of "seizing the day," mobilized the masses to thoroughly revolutionize the institutions. The responsible comrades of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the main responsible comrades of various departments and offices personally led the institutional staff to go deep into the districts (counties), factories, enterprises, and commercial units at the grassroots level, holding meetings with cadres, workers, and revolutionary masses to extensively solicit opinions on streamlining and reducing bureaucracy and achieving institutional revolutionization. At the same time, in various levels of revolutionary committees and institutional departments, we thoroughly criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power, criticized conservatism, and smashed the resistance of the old forces of the exploiting class. After thorough investigation and research, we formulated a plan for streamlining and reducing bureaucracy. The number of people in the new Municipal Revolutionary Committee's institutions was greatly reduced compared to the old Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee's institutions. The organizational revolutionization promoted ideological revolutionization. After the revolutionary committee implemented streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, the leadership members went deep into the grassroots and among the masses. Many long-standing difficult problems in the city were quickly solved. For example, the Second Light Industry Bureau had long been unable to unite. The revolutionary committee members went deep into this bureau, helped them implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and, together with the revolutionary masses, launched a proactive attack on a handful of class enemies, finally exposing the walking capitalist roaders who were stirring up the masses to fight the masses behind the scenes. The revolutionary and production situation in this unit immediately showed significant changes.

We have achieved some results on the path of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy. However, compared to the Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee, we still have a long way to go. In the future, we must learn from the Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee, seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, mobilize the masses, thoroughly eliminate the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison that China's Khrushchev spread in the construction of political power, and firmly take the path of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy. We must truly build the revolutionary committee into a revolutionary and people-oriented leadership team, and forever follow the revolutionary course indicated by Chairman Mao!

    放手发动群众，走精兵简政的道路
    青岛市革命委员会
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”灵宝县革命委员会遵照伟大领袖毛主席的指示，勇敢地跳出原来旧机构的圈子，实行领导班子革命化，精兵简政，密切联系群众，给我们作出了很好的榜样。
    灵宝县革委会精兵简政的经验，值得我们学习的地方很多，其中最值得我们学习的是他们在政权建设方面，充分相信群众，放手发动群众的彻底革命精神。
    青岛市革命委员会，在“一月革命”风暴中诞生以后，面临着一个急待解决的问题：如何在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，把新生的革命委员会建设成为精干的战斗指挥部。我们反复学习了伟大领袖毛主席关于精兵简政的指示，决心打破旧市委、旧市人委那套重叠的行政机构，组织起适应阶级斗争需要的领导班子。当时，调整和改革了一些部、室，工作人员比原来减少了三分之二。
    第一次改革行政机构，虽然取得了很大成绩，但是，旧市委、旧市人委合并起来的部室，层次没有减少，仍然不能适应无产阶级文化大革命胜利发展的新形势。重叠的行政机构，就象横在革命委员会同群众之间的“墙”，层次越多，“墙”越厚，严重地影响了领导班子同广大革命群众的密切联系。革命群众迫切要求革命委员会落实毛主席的最新指示，走彻底的“精兵简政”的道路。
    就在这时，有些同志担心起来了。他们被旧的习惯势力束缚住了手脚，认为现在革命委员会中的一个工作人员要做旧市委、旧市人委三个人的工作，再要精简，有些工作就“拨不转了”。一小撮阶级敌人也煽阴风，点邪火，阻挠和破坏精兵简政工作的进行。
    在政权建设方面，是走反革命修正主义道路，还是跳出原来旧机构的圈子，走一条崭新的革命化道路？这是一场尖锐的、深刻的阶级斗争，一定要发动一场轰轰烈烈的革命群众运动。广大革命群众最听毛主席的话，最关心革命委员会的建设。只有充分相信群众，放手发动群众，才能完成革命委员会建设的重要任务。我们认真学习了毛主席关于革命委员会建设的最新指示，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，深入发动群众，大搞机关革命化。市革委会负责同志及各部、室的主要负责人，亲自带领机关干部，深入区（县）、工厂、企业、财贸等基层单位，召开干部、工人、革命群众座谈会，广泛征求对精兵简政、实现机关革命化的意见。同时，在各级革命委员会、机关各部门，彻底批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线，批判了保守主义，击破了剥削阶级旧势力的抵抗。经过充分调查、研究，制订了精兵简政的方案。市革委会新的机构的人员比旧市委、旧市人委的机构的人员大大减少。组织革命化推动了思想革命化。革委会实行精兵简政以后，领导成员纷纷深入基层，深入群众。全市许多老大难的问题迅速得到解决。如第二轻工业局长期联合不起来。革委会成员深入到这个局，帮助他们落实毛主席的最新指示，同革命群众一起向一小撮阶级敌人主动进攻，终于揪出了在幕后挑动群众斗群众的走资派。这个单位的革命和生产形势立即发生了显著的变化。
    我们在“精兵简政”的道路上取得了一些成绩。但是同灵宝县革命委员会相比，我们做得还很不够。今后，我们一定要向灵宝县革命委员会学习，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，放手发动群众，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所散布的反革命修正主义流毒，坚定不移地走“精兵简政”的道路，真正把革委会建设成为革命化的联系群众的领导班子，永远沿着毛主席所指引的革命航道前进！
