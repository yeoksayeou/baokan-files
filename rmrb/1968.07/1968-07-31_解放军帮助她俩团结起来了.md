Two female workers who were once as close as sisters were poisoned by bourgeois factionalism and separated. PLA comrades used Mao Zedong Thought to help them reunite. They recalled their hardships and sweet moments, using bitter herbs to form the words "Chairman Mao Waves His Hand, I March Forward" as a memento.

Female workers Yang Xiuqin and Wang Shuguang from the Yantai Grape Wine Factory used their rest time to gather many bitter herbs and carefully crafted a brilliant memento: a radiant sun emitting countless golden rays, with the great leader Chairman Mao waving his hand. In the direction of Chairman Mao's wave, the words "Chairman Mao Waves His Hand, I March Forward" are composed of yellow bitter herbs, strong and powerful, arranged together.

Why did they create this memento? Let's start with them.

Yang Xiuqin and Wang Shuguang have worked in the same team since they joined the factory. Over the course of more than six years, they cared for and supported each other, united like sisters. During the Cultural Revolution, these close sisters joined different revolutionary mass organizations within the factory. Due to the influence and poisoning of the bourgeois reactionary line and bourgeois factionalism, the two sisters became enemies, not speaking to each other, and arguing when they did. Even after the factory achieved revolutionary unity, the ideological gap between them remained deep.

Comrade Wang Bingxin of the PLA stationed at the factory learned of this situation and decided to use Mao Zedong Thought to educate them, helping them overcome bourgeois factionalism and unite on a new basis. He organized them to participate in a Mao Zedong Thought study class and placed them in the same class. He enthusiastically helped them repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, denouncing the heinous crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line with them, and praising the correctness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. He patiently told them, "We are all children of poor peasants, class sisters bound by flesh and blood. If we fight among ourselves, it will only make our friends sad and our enemies happy. Such foolish acts, we workers must firmly not do!"

Yang Xiuqin and Wang Shuguang studied Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and quickly raised their class consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle. They thought: Indeed! We workers, what unresolved contradictions and fundamental differences do we have? None, absolutely none. We are two bitter gourds on the same vine! We love the Party, Chairman Mao, socialism, and communism from the bottom of our hearts; we hate the old society's exploitation system, the capitalists, and China's Khrushchev's restoration of capitalism to the bone. Our interests are the same. Thinking of the same problem, the more they thought, the more they felt they had strayed from Chairman Mao's teachings, and the more sincere they became in opening their hearts to each other. Wang Bingxin then helped them study the "Three Articles" together, fighting against the "self" deeply rooted in their souls. The red sun's rays illuminated their hearts. "Sister Yang!" Wang Shuguang said excitedly and regretfully, "I treated you badly in the past, and I'm sorry..." Wang Shuguang took the initiative to criticize herself. Yang Xiuqin immediately felt warm in her heart. She suppressed her inner excitement and quickly comforted her, "Little Wang, this isn't your fault. Blame it all on the evil bourgeois reactionary line!" The more they talked, the more excited they became, the more they opened their hearts, and the more they eliminated the long-standing ideological barriers, uniting together.

One day, the workers went to the vineyard to labor. Wang Shuguang pulled Yang Xiuqin's hand, pointing to the bitter herbs blooming on the ridge and said, "Sister, look, what is this?" Yang Xiuqin looked at the bitter herbs and tears welled up in her eyes. They sat side by side on the ridge. Yang Xiuqin, with every word filled with blood and tears, and every voice filled with hatred, recounted the tragic experiences of her family relying on wild vegetables for survival in the old society.

Their hearts became even closer. They said, "The PLA is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and helped us two unite. We must learn the spirit of the PLA's infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao and use bitter herbs to make a memento!" Thus, this memento was created.

### 解放军帮助她俩团结起来了

    解放军帮助她俩团结起来了
    两个原来亲如姐妹的女工，受到资产阶级派性的毒害分开了。解放军同志用毛泽东思想帮助她们团结起来。她们忆苦思甜，用苦菜花组成“毛主席挥手我前进”八个大字，作为纪念。
    烟台葡萄酿酒厂包装女工杨秀琴、王树贵，利用休息时间，采集了许多苦菜花，精心地制作了一幅光彩夺目的纪念品：一轮红日放射着万道金光，伟大领袖毛主席挥着巨手。在毛主席挥手的方向，由一朵朵黄色的苦菜花组成的“毛主席挥手我前进”八个大字，苍劲有力，排列在一起。
    她俩为什么制作这幅纪念品？还得从她俩谈起。
    杨秀琴、王树贵从入厂那天起，就在一个班组工作。在六年多朝夕相处的日子里，俩人互相关心，互相爱护，团结得象一对亲姐妹。文化大革命中，这对亲密无间的姐妹，分别参加了厂内两个革命群众组织。由于受了资产阶级反动路线和资产阶级派性的毒害和影响，两个亲姐妹成了冤家对头，见面不说话，说话就吵架。厂里实现了革命大联合以后，她俩思想上的隔阂仍然很深。
    驻厂人民解放军王秉鑫同志知道了这个情况，决心用毛泽东思想教育她们克服资产阶级派性，在新的基础上团结起来，就动员她俩一起参加了毛泽东思想学习班，并把她俩编在一个班里。他热情地帮助她俩反复学习毛主席的最新指示，和她俩一起控诉资产阶级反动路线的滔天罪行，歌颂毛主席革命路线的英明正确。他耐心地对她俩说：“我们都是贫下中农的子弟，是血肉相连的阶级姐妹。我们自己闹对立，自己斗自己，只能使亲者痛，仇者快，这样的傻事，我们工人阶级坚决不能干！”
    杨秀琴、王树贵学习了毛主席一系列最新指示，迅速提高了阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。她俩觉得：是啊！我们工人阶级，到底有什么解决不了的矛盾和原则的分歧呢？没有，根本没有。我们是一根藤上的两个苦瓜啊！对党对毛主席，对社会主义共产主义打心眼里爱；对旧社会剥削制度，对资本家，对中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义从骨子里恨，我们之间那一点利害都一样。俩人想着同一个问题，越想越觉得背离了毛主席的教导，相互有了交心的诚意。王秉鑫又帮她俩一起学习了“老三篇”，狠斗了灵魂深处的私字。红太阳的光辉照亮了她俩的心。“杨大姐！”王树贵激动而惭愧地说：“我过去对你的态度不好，很对不起你……”王树贵主动作了自我批评。杨秀琴顿时心头热乎乎的。她压住内心的激动，赶忙安慰她说：“小王，这不能怪你。千怪万怪，都怪万恶的资产阶级反动路线！”俩人越谈越激动，越谈心贴得越紧，消除了长期以来形成的思想隔阂，团结了起来。
    一天，工人们到葡萄园劳动。王树贵拉着杨秀琴的手，指着田埂上盛开的苦菜花说：“大姐，你看，这是什么？”杨秀琴看着苦菜花，眼泪夺眶而出。她俩肩并肩坐在田埂上。杨秀琴句句血泪，声声仇恨，诉说着旧社会一家全靠挖野菜为生的悲惨遭遇。
    两人的心连得更紧了。她们说：“解放军无限忠于毛主席，帮助我们俩团结起来了。我们要学习解放军无限忠于毛主席的精神，用苦菜花来做个纪念品吧！”于是，这幅纪念品就做出来了。
