The reactionary government of Sato in Japan, utilizing the "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" concocted by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, has intensified its anti-China clamor and is using this as an excuse to speed up the nuclear armament of Japanese militarism.

The "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" fabricated by the U.S. and Soviet revisionism is a grand conspiracy aimed at maintaining their nuclear hegemony, controlling, and enslaving non-nuclear countries. It is also a component of their conspiracy against the Chinese people. During the process of the U.S. and Soviet Union's fabrication of this treaty, the Sato reactionary government, as the U.S. imperialism's "overseer" in Asia, frantically used the nuclear issue to engage in anti-China clamor.

Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku openly shouted, "We must not forget that China, which possesses nuclear weapons, is nearby," and "The biggest issue in Asia today is how to block the influence of Communist China, which possesses nuclear weapons." He adopted the posture of a U.S. imperialist henchman, saying: "Japan must first support (the United States') policy of containing China." Sato even joined his American masters in shouting, "To create conditions for Asian countries not to be threatened by Communist China." Sato's barking is a conspiracy to use the so-called "threat of Communist China" to help the Johnson administration incite anti-China sentiment, attempting to drag the countries and regions near China under the "nuclear umbrella" of the U.S. imperialists, working hard as a running dog for his American masters' conspiracy against China.

The Sato reactionary government, in its madness, portrayed China's development of nuclear weapons for self-defense as a "threat," also to create an excuse for Japanese militarism to speed up nuclear armament. In fact, while the Sato clique was shouting about the so-called "Chinese nuclear threat," they openly announced that Japan "must consider defense issues, including the development of nuclear weapons." Sato himself declared that he would "not issue a non-nuclear declaration" during his term. Japanese financial tycoon Kobayashi Chū also bluntly said, "Japan should also possess nuclear weapons." This fully shows that the Sato government is using the slogan of opposing China as an excuse to revive Japanese militarism and speed up nuclear armament.

In fact, the Sato reactionary government in Japan, under the protection of U.S. imperialism, has long been actively engaged in nuclear armament, and the so-called "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" cannot restrict Japan from importing nuclear weapons and engaging in nuclear armament.

Moreover, the Sato government's "Third Defense Build-Up Plan" has already stipulated the secret manufacture of nuclear weapons and the production of missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads, as well as the expansion of the production of F-104 aircraft capable of carrying nuclear bombs. On February 26 of this year, the U.S. imperialists and the Sato government signed the so-called "Atomic Energy Cooperation Agreement" for the U.S. to help Japan produce nuclear weapons.

The Sato reactionary government's new conspiracy against China and its criminal acts of speeding up nuclear armament have been strongly condemned by the broad masses of the Japanese people.

    为美苏核恶霸的核讹诈阴谋大效犬马之劳
    佐藤声嘶力竭再次发出反华嚎叫
    利用反华加紧日本核武装，财界巨头公然叫嚷“日本也应拥有核武器”
    据新华社讯　日本佐藤反动政府利用美帝和苏修炮制的“防止核扩散条约”，加紧反华叫嚣，并进而为日本军国主义加紧进行核武装制造借口。
    美帝和苏修合伙炮制的“防止核扩散条约”，是它们为了维持核霸权、控制和奴役无核国家的一个大阴谋；同时也是它们反对中国人民的阴谋的一个组成部分。在美苏炮制这个条约的过程中，作为美帝在亚洲“总管”的佐藤反动政府疯狂地利用核问题进行反华叫嚣。
    日本首相佐藤荣作公然叫嚷：“不能忘记拥有核武器的中国就在邻近”，“今天亚洲最大的课题是如何挡住拥有核武器的共产党中国的影响”。他摆出一副美帝帮凶架势说：日本“首先必须支持（美国）遏制中国的政策”。佐藤甚至还同他的美国主子一起叫嚷，要“为亚洲国家不受共产党中国威胁创造条件”。佐藤的这番狂吠，就是阴谋用所谓“共产党中国的威胁”来帮助约翰逊政府煽动反华情绪，妄图把中国邻近的国家和地区拉到美帝的“核保护伞”下，为其美国主子反对中国的阴谋大效犬马之劳。
    佐藤反动政府丧心病狂地把中国人民为了自卫而发展核武器说成是什么“威胁”，也是为了给日本军国主义加紧进行核武装制造借口。实际上，就是在佐藤之流大喊大叫所谓中国“核威胁”的同时，他们公然宣布，日本“必须考虑包括发展核武器在内的防卫问题”。佐藤本人扬言在他的任期内“不发表非核武装宣言”。日本财界巨头小林中也露骨地说：“日本也应拥有核武器”。这充分表明，佐藤政府阴谋用反对中国的口号作为复活日本军国主义和加紧进行核武装的托辞。
    事实上，日本佐藤反动政府多年来在美帝的卵翼下，一直在积极进行核武装，而所谓“防止核扩散条约”也根本限制不了日本运进核武器和进行核武装。
    另外，日本佐藤政府的“第三次扩军计划”已经规定秘密制造核武器和生产能够运载核弹头的导弹、扩充能够运载核弹的F—104飞机的生产；今年二月二十六日，美帝和佐藤政府又签订了美国帮助日本生产核武器的所谓“原子能合作协定”。
    佐藤反动政府的反华新阴谋和加紧核武装的罪恶行径，受到了广大日本人民的强烈谴责。
