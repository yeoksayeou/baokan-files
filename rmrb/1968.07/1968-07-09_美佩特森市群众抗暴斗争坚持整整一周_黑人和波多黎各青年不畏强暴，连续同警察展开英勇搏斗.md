Despite the brutal suppression by reactionary police, the black people and Puerto Ricans of Paterson, New Jersey, who launched their struggle against violence on July 1st, have persisted for an entire week as of July 7th.

Following four consecutive nights of fierce struggle against the reactionary police last week, the black people and Puerto Ricans of Paterson once again engaged in a fierce battle with fully armed police on Friday night and Saturday morning. Groups of angry demonstrators threw homemade Molotov cocktails, stones, and bottles at police cars. Some threw Molotov cocktails from rooftops at buildings and hurled chunks of coal at police cars. Later, a large crowd gathered in the streets, holding a march and demonstration. They smashed the stores of white exploiters with bricks and stones along the way and angrily denounced the police's brutal beating of a Puerto Rican youth in front of the police.

The reactionary authorities dispatched a large number of police to suppress the demonstrators. The police, wearing helmets and gas masks, fired at the demonstrators and released tear gas. The demonstrators bravely fought back, injuring several police officers. On Friday night, fifty-some demonstrators were arbitrarily arrested.

On July 7th, the anti-violence crowd continued their struggle. They used stones and glass bottles to counterattack the police and set fire to five cars. (Accompanying photo)

In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, black people also fearlessly fought against the reactionary military police who came to suppress them in a struggle against violence.

    新华社八日讯　华盛顿消息：不顾反动警察血腥镇压，美国佩特森市黑人和波多黎各人从一日掀起的抗暴斗争，到七日为止已经坚持了整整一周。
    继上周一连四个晚上同反动警察进行英勇斗争后，佩特森市的黑人和波多黎各人在星期五晚上、星期六清晨又同全副武装的警察展开了一场激烈的搏斗。一群群愤怒的示威青年向警车扔自制燃烧瓶、石块和瓶子。有的从屋顶上向一些建筑物投掷燃烧瓶，向警车投掷煤渣块。后来，一大群青年聚集在街头，举行游行示威。他们沿途用砖头、石块砸白人剥削者的商店，并且在警察面前愤怒谴责警察无端毒打一名波多黎各青年的血腥暴行。
    反动统治当局又出动大批警察镇压示威者。警察戴着钢盔和防毒面具，向示威群众开枪和施放催泪瓦斯。示威群众英勇还击，打伤数名警察。星期五晚上，有五十几名示威者横遭逮捕。
    七日，抗暴群众仍在坚持斗争。他们用石块、玻璃瓶反击警察，并且放火烧毁了五辆汽车。（附图片）
