Under the brilliant guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary committees at all levels in Liaoning Province have led the broad revolutionary masses of the entire province to carry out a more extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism. They have launched a sustained and fierce attack on a handful of class enemies. The revolutionary criticism has powerfully struck down the rightist capitulationist evil wind of a handful of class enemies, effectively consolidating and developing the great alliance of the revolution and the three-in-one combination of the revolution. The revolutionary and production situation in the entire province is excellent and getting better. Currently, out of the fifteen cities and prefectures (reclamation areas) in the province, twelve have established revolutionary committees; all forty-two counties have established revolutionary committees. Industrial and agricultural production in the entire province is thriving, with steel and coal production and transportation efficiency improving month by month.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, a revolution by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its leadership of the broad revolutionary masses of the people and the reactionary Kuomintang, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." After the birth of the Liaoning Provincial Revolutionary Committee in the storm of class struggle, it has taken Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a sharp weapon, seriously analyzed the new situation, new characteristics, and new trends of class struggle, and extensively mobilized the revolutionary masses to carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, accurately and fiercely striking down a handful of class enemies. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committees, the broad revolutionary masses of the entire province have raised the invincible red flag of Mao Zedong Thought high, quickly launching a wave of revolutionary criticism.

One important feature of the revolutionary criticism in Liaoning Province is that it closely combines the revolutionary criticism with the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary criticism has promoted the in-depth development of the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has, in turn, raised the revolutionary criticism to a new level.

The broad revolutionary masses in the entire province use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide the revolutionary criticism and study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the revolutionary criticism. The broad revolutionary masses study one of Chairman Mao's quotations and criticize one of the counter-revolutionary crimes of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, such as China's Khrushchev. They have achieved the goal of studying Mao Zedong Thought with problems in mind, studying and applying it actively, combining study with application, and seeing immediate results. The battlefield of revolutionary criticism is also a large classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The speeches made by the broad revolutionary masses at criticism meetings and the big-character posters they write are both powerful shells to strike down class enemies and summaries of their experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. In the revolutionary criticism, Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been widely popularized. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of June, the entire province had held more than 650,000 study classes of various types, with more than 15.5 million participants.

The second feature of the revolutionary criticism in Liaoning Province is that the focus of the struggle has always been directed at the most important and dangerous enemy—China's Khrushchev and his agents in Northeast China and Liaoning. It has fiercely struck down the rightist capitulationist evil wind of a handful of class enemies, continuously consolidating and developing the newly born revolutionary committees. After achieving a decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of class enemies are not willing to accept their doom. They have spread the rightist capitulationist evil wind, attempting to split the revolutionary masses, split the revolutionary committees, and split the unity between the military and the people. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committees at all levels, the broad revolutionary masses have firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, always directing the focus of the struggle at China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Northeast region and Liaoning. They have deeply exposed and criticized their various counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, striking them down and exposing their ugly faces in broad daylight. This has powerfully struck down the rightist capitulationist evil wind and consolidated the newly born revolutionary committees.

Combining the revolutionary criticism with the criticism of a handful of capitalist-roaders within their own units, through the revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary masses have identified their common enemies, united and strengthened the revolutionary ranks, united the majority of cadres, and consolidated and developed the great alliance of the revolution and the three-in-one combination of the revolution. This is the third feature of the revolutionary criticism in Liaoning Province.

While criticizing the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in Northeast China and Liaoning, the broad revolutionary masses in Liaoning have combined their criticism upward with the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of China's Khrushchev and downward with the criticism of the handful of capitalist-roaders within their own units. In this way, they have linked the evil activities of class enemies within their own units with the counter-revolutionary crimes of China's Khrushchev's agents in Northeast China and Liaoning. This has helped the broad revolutionary masses to clearly see who are friends and who are enemies, effectively eliminating differences and consolidating and developing the great alliance of the revolution. Using this method to carry out revolutionary criticism has also helped some cadres who have made mistakes to raise their awareness of the two-line struggle, making them, in the process of deeply exposing and criticizing the class enemies' anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes, and deeply exposing and criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line in the struggle, deeply touch their souls. They have, through practical actions, drawn a clear line between themselves and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line, standing on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, gaining the understanding and support of the broad revolutionary masses. They have stood up to revolutionize, greatly accelerating the progress of the three-in-one combination of the revolution.

The fourth feature of the revolutionary criticism in Liaoning Province is that the in-depth development of the revolutionary criticism has promoted the work of cleaning up the class ranks, making all class enemies exposed in broad daylight.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "It is necessary to maintain a high degree of vigilance in all work departments, to be able to distinguish those who pretend to support the revolution but actually oppose the revolution, to cleanse them from our various fronts, and thus to safeguard the great victories we have already won and will win." Chairman Mao's great teaching has greatly raised the class struggle awareness of the broad revolutionary masses in the entire province, making them clear-sighted and keen-scented, greatly enhancing their ability to identify class enemies of various kinds. Riding on the wind of revolutionary criticism, they have fiercely pursued and struck down a handful of class enemies, exposing traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks. These achievements have enriched the content of revolutionary criticism. Through the exposure and struggle against these class enemies, the broad revolutionary masses have further aroused their deep hatred for China's Khrushchev and his agents.

At present, the broad revolutionary masses in Liaoning are advancing victoriously, developing the excellent situation, and are determined to raise the banner of revolutionary criticism even higher, to thoroughly expose and criticize China's Khrushchev and his agents, to fight them down and stink them up, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    革命大批判发展了革命和生产大好形势
    辽宁省各级革委会率领广大革命群众，高举革命大批判的旗帜，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的反革命修正主义谬论，有效地巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命三结合，工农业生产蒸蒸日上
    新华社沈阳十一日电 在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，辽宁省各级革命委员会率领全省广大革命人民群众，更广泛更深入地开展革命大批判，向一小撮阶级敌人发动了持续的猛烈进攻。革命的大批判，强有力地打击了一小撮阶级敌人的右倾翻案妖风，有效地巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命三结合。全省革命和生产形势大好，越来越好。现在，全省十五个市和专区（垦区）已有十二个建立了革命委员会；四十二个县已经全部建立了革命委员会。全省工农业生产蒸蒸日上，钢铁和煤炭产量、交通运输效率月月提高。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”辽宁省革命委员会在阶级斗争的暴风雨中胜利诞生后，就以毛主席这一最新指示为锐利武器，认真分析了阶级斗争的新形势、新特点、新动向，广泛动员革命人民群众深入持久地开展革命大批判，稳准狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。在革命委员会的带领下，全省广大革命人民群众，高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，迅速掀起了革命大批判的热潮。
    辽宁省革命大批判的一个重要特点是，开展革命大批判同活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动紧密结合，革命大批判推动了活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的深入发展，活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，又把革命的大批判提高到了一个新的水平。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。全省广大革命群众用战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅革命大批判，在革命大批判中活学活用毛泽东思想。广大革命群众学习毛主席一条语录，批判中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的一条反革命罪行，对毛泽东思想做到了带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，立竿见影。革命大批判的战场，同时也是活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂。广大革命群众在批判会上的发言，他们写的革命大批判的大字报，既是狠狠打击阶级敌人的炮弹，又是活学活用毛泽东思想的心得体会。在革命大批判中，毛泽东思想学习班得到了空前大普及。据不完全统计，到六月份止，全省共举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班六十五万多期，参加学习的达一千五百五十多万人次。
    辽宁省革命大批判的第二个特点是，斗争矛头始终直指最主要最危险的敌人——中国赫鲁晓夫及其在东北和辽宁的代理人，狠狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人的右倾翻案妖风，通过大批判不断巩固和发展新生的革命委员会。在夺得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利后，一小撮阶级敌人并不甘心于自己的灭亡。他们刮起了右倾翻案妖风，妄图分裂革命群众，分裂革命委员会，分裂军民团结。广大革命群众在各级革命委员会领导下，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，始终把斗争矛头对准中国赫鲁晓夫及其在东北地区和辽宁的代理人，深揭狠批他们的各种反革命修正主义谬论，从政治上、思想上、理论上，把他们批倒批臭，使他们的丑恶嘴脸暴露在光天化日之下，从而有力地打击了右倾翻案妖风，巩固了新生的革命委员会。
    把革命大批判同批判本单位的一小撮走资派结合起来，通过革命大批判，使广大革命群众认清共同的敌人，团结和壮大革命的队伍，团结干部的大多数，巩固和发展革命大联合和革命三结合，是辽宁省革命大批判的第三个特点。
    辽宁的广大革命群众，在批判东北和辽宁党内一小撮走资派的时候，向上结合批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义谬论，向下结合批判本单位的党内一小撮走资派，这样，就把本单位阶级敌人的罪恶活动，同中国赫鲁晓夫在东北、在辽宁的代理人的反革命罪行串起来，使广大革命群众更加认清了谁是朋友，谁是敌人，有效地消除了分歧，巩固和发展了革命的大联合。采用这样的方法开展革命大批判，也帮助一些犯了错误的干部提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，使他们在深揭深批阶级敌人反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想罪行的过程中，在深揭深批资产阶级反动路线的战斗中，狠触了自己的灵魂，用实际行动划清了同党内一小撮走资派、同资产阶级反动路线的界限，站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，取得了广大革命群众的谅解和支持。他们纷纷站出来革命，大大加快了革命三结合的进程。
    辽宁省革命大批判的第四个特点是，革命大批判的深入发展，带动了清理阶级队伍的工作，使一切阶级敌人一个个暴露在光天化日之下。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“必须在各个工作部门中保持高度的警惕性，善于辨别那些伪装拥护革命而实际反对革命的分子，把他们从我们的各个战线上清洗出去，这样来保卫我们已经取得的和将要取得的伟大的胜利。”毛主席的这一伟大教导，极大地提高了全省广大革命群众的阶级斗争觉悟，使他们心明眼亮，嗅觉灵敏，大大增强了识别形形色色的阶级敌人的能力。他们乘革命大批判的东风，狠追猛打一小撮阶级敌人，把混入革命队伍的叛徒、特务和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，一个个挖了出来。这些战果又充实了革命大批判的内容。通过对这些阶级敌人的揭发斗争，更进一步激起了广大革命群众对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的无比仇恨。
    目前，辽宁广大革命群众正在乘胜前进，发展大好形势，决心更高地举起革命批判的大旗，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人揭深揭透，斗倒斗臭，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
