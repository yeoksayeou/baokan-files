They beat drums and gongs, shouting slogans: "Firmly support the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership!" "Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live Chairman Ho Chi Minh!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Also present at the airport to welcome the delegation were leaders from various relevant departments of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and revolutionary mass organizations. Vietnamese students studying in Shanghai were also at the airport to greet the delegation.
