The counter-revolutionary element Chen Dengke, in the novel "Storm and Thunder," deliberately portrays a demoted militia squad leader, Ren Weiqun. Through this character, he shamelessly advocates for the reversal of verdicts and spreads a black wind of reversing verdicts.

In Chen Dengke's depiction, this Ren Weiqun is described as "neither seeking fame, nor seeking profit, nor seeking food and clothing," an "invaluable good cadre." It is said that because he has a "hot temper," "impulsive nature," and "stubborn character," he tied up and beat the reactionary rich peasant Huang Longfei, and thus was demoted and had his gun confiscated, only retaining the empty title of "branch committee member." To emphasize the "injustice" of the demotion, Chen Dengke, through Ren Weiqun's mouth, loudly proclaims: "My heart is red, and even if my bones are burned to ashes, they are still red," maliciously attacking our Party for "unjustly" "mistreating good people"!

This counter-revolutionary element, Chen Dengke, is advocating for whom? He is reversing the verdicts for whom? Just look at the black goods peddled by the Chinese Khrushchev at the enlarged Central Work Conference in 1962, and investigate the evil deeds of the counter-revolutionary revisionist Li Baohua after he went to Anhui, and the truth will be revealed.

At the enlarged Central Work Conference, the Chinese Khrushchev openly jumped out to reverse the verdict for the demoted ambitious plotter, Peng Dehuai, viciously attacking Chairman Mao's leadership in the struggle against the Peng Dehuai anti-party clique as an "erroneous and excessive struggle." This Chinese Khrushchev is the chief culprit of the black wind of reversing verdicts.

After the enlarged Central Work Conference, Li Baohua, the agent of the Chinese Khrushchev in Anhui, in Anhui, carried out a "one-blow" campaign, "batch by batch, string by string, leaving no tail," reversing the verdicts for those right-opportunists, rightists, and counter-revolutionaries.

Under the personal instruction of the Chinese Khrushchev and the direct command of the counter-revolutionary revisionist Li Baohua, the reactionary novel "Storm and Thunder" was created. It enthusiastically advocates for its black masters, spreading the black wind of reversing verdicts. The reversal of verdicts for Ren Weiqun in "Storm and Thunder" is in accordance with the instructions of the Chinese Khrushchev and Li Baohua, aiming to reverse the verdicts for the anti-party elements represented by Peng Dehuai.

These reactionaries, who are spreading the black wind of reversing verdicts, are doing so to wash away the anti-party crimes of their group, to usurp the Party, the government, and the military, to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to restore capitalism. In a word, reversing verdicts is to change the regime.

In the reactionary novel "Storm and Thunder," the demoted militia squad leader, Ren Weiqun, later returns to power, carries a gun, becomes the branch secretary, and holds the Party and government power. The conclusion carefully arranged by the counter-revolutionary element Chen Dengke fully exposes their evil plot of spreading the black wind of reversing verdicts.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended with struggle." The revolutionary people will never allow the class enemies to reverse verdicts and change the regime. The anti-party clique represented by Peng Dehuai has committed numerous crimes, and the evidence is irrefutable. This "case" cannot be reversed, and it will never be reversed. To reverse verdicts and change the regime, this can only be a daytime dream, a futile wish!

Spreading the black wind of reversing verdicts is a common counter-revolutionary trick used by the class enemies. They not only used this trick in the past but will also use it in the future. At present, at the critical moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a small handful of stubborn class enemies, including diehard capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, are again spreading a rightist black wind of reversing verdicts.

We are the People's Liberation Army of China, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We will definitely carry out a thorough criticism of the reactionary novel "Storm and Thunder" and its spread of the black wind of reversing verdicts, and eliminate its poison. We must also thoroughly smash the rightist black wind of reversing verdicts spread by the current small handful of class enemies!

    批臭黑《风雷》，粉碎翻案风
    解放军某部营长、一级战斗英雄　胡修道
    反革命分子陈登科，在《风雷》中，别有用心地描写了一个被罢了官的民兵大队长任为群。通过这个人物，大做翻案文章，大刮翻案黑风。
    在陈登科的笔下，这个任为群，“一不为名、二不为利、三又不为吃和穿”，是一个“不可多得的好干部”。就是因为“火气大”，“性子暴”，“脾气硬”，捆打了反动富农黄龙飞，竟然被罢了官，缴了枪，只留下一个“总支委员”的空头衔。为了渲染“罢官”的“冤屈”，陈登科借任为群之口，大肆叫嚷：“我的心是红的，把我的骨头烧成灰也是红的”，恶毒地攻击我们党“平白无故”地“错打了好人”！
    陈登科这个反革命分子，是在为谁鸣冤叫屈呢？是在为谁翻案呢？只要看一看中国赫鲁晓夫在一九六二年扩大的中央工作会议上贩卖的黑货，查一查反革命修正主义分子李葆华到安徽后所干的罪恶勾当，真相就大白了。
    在扩大的中央工作会议上，中国赫鲁晓夫公然跳出来为被罢了官的大野心家、大阴谋家彭德怀翻案，恶毒地攻击毛主席领导的对彭德怀反党集团的斗争是“错误的过火的斗争”。这个中国赫鲁晓夫，就是大刮翻案黑风的罪魁祸首。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在安徽的代理人李葆华，在扩大的中央工作会议之后，就在安徽大搞“一风吹”，“一批批，一串串，不留尾巴”地为那些右倾机会主义分子、右派分子、反革命分子翻案。
      在中国赫鲁晓夫亲自授意、反革命修正主义分子李葆华直接指使下炮制出来的《风雷》，卖命地为其黑主子大刮翻案风摇旗呐喊。《风雷》为任为群翻案，就是秉承中国赫鲁晓夫和李葆华的旨意，要为以彭德怀为代表的反党分子翻案。
      这些反动家伙，大刮特刮翻案黑风，就是为了洗刷他们那一伙的反党罪行，就是为了篡党篡政篡军，就是为了颠覆无产阶级专政，就是为了复辟资本主义。一句话，翻案就是要变天。
    在反动小说《风雷》中，那个被罢了官的民兵大队长任为群，后来不是又上了台、扛了枪、当上了总支书记、掌握了党政大权吗！反革命分子陈登科精心安排的这个结局，充分地暴露了他们大刮翻案黑风的罪恶阴谋。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”革命的人民，决不允许阶级敌人翻案变天。以彭德怀为代表的反党集团，罪行累累，铁证如山，这个“案”，是翻不了的，是永远也翻不了的。要想翻案变天，这只能是白日做梦，痴心妄想！
    大刮翻案风，是阶级敌人惯用的反革命伎俩。这种伎俩他们不仅过去使用，今后还会使用。当前，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，一小撮顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，又刮起了一股右倾翻案黑风。
    我们是无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的革命路线的中国人民解放军。我们对反动小说《风雷》所刮起的翻案黑风，一定要进行彻底的批判，肃清其流毒；我们对当前一小撮阶级敌人刮起的右倾翻案黑风，也必须彻底粉碎！
