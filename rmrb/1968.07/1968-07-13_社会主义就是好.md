Socialism is Good

Member of the Anhui Provincial Revolutionary Committee, Director of the East Is Red People's Commune Revolutionary Committee, Chen Xue Meng

Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anhui, Li Baohua and Huang Yan, in order to meet the needs of restoring capitalism, instructed the reactionary Chen Dengke to write a black book called "Storm and Thunder." That black book is long and stinks, full of nonsense, it defames socialism and praises capitalism. Chen Dengke, this reactionary, under the guise of writing about agricultural cooperatives, slanders socialism and advocates for capitalism. He is truly a venomous and slippery snake in the mud!

This black book advocates for individual farming, claiming that individual farming is "heavenly life."

Our dearest Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only socialism can save China."

We poor and lower-middle peasants have experienced the bitterness of individual farming. We deeply understand: individual farming is taking the capitalist road, it is to restore capitalism. Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anhui, in Anhui, promote "three freedoms and one contract," "responsibility system," and spread the wind of individual farming. We poor and lower-middle peasants firmly oppose it. They propagandize the "ten advantages" of the "responsibility system," and we propagandize the "ten disadvantages" of the "responsibility system." We also composed a catchy tune: "Individual farming is like a single plank bridge, shaky with every step. The commune is the path to heaven, the only road to communism!" Our reasoning is strong, our spirit is robust, our numbers are many, and our path is correct!

This black book falsely claims that we poor and lower-middle peasants are "afraid" to take the socialist road. In the book, an old poor peasant organizes a mutual aid team, but faces rejections everywhere. He walks in circles, talks until his mouth is dry, but many poor and lower-middle peasants still refuse, eventually making him sick. This is pure slander! We poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, and we are the most enthusiastic and resolute in taking the socialist road. When we were promoting cooperatives and communes, our spirits were high! We wrote applications day and night, with red application forms piled high. As soon as the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants heard Chairman Mao's call, everyone rushed forward, beating drums and gongs, filled with joy, willingly and enthusiastically, where was there any fear?!

Those who are afraid of socialism, well, there are such people, but they are not us poor and lower-middle peasants, but those capitalist-roaders, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and their mastermind, Chinese Khrushchev.

Why do these reactionaries want to spread the wind of individual farming? Why do they shout that capitalism is "good"? This is not surprising. Because they represent the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the interests of the bourgeoisie, and the interests of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They just want to destroy the collective economy of the people's communes, restore capitalism, and make us return to the old capitalist road, letting us suffer twice. This is truly a daytime dream!

Socialism is good! Socialism is truly good! We poor and lower-middle peasants have decided to take the socialist road. Whoever wants to restore capitalism, whether it's Chen Dengke or Li Dengke, whether it's a "black cat" or a "white cat," our iron fists will smash their spines!

    社会主义就是好
    安徽省革命委员会委员、凤阳县东方红人民公社革委会主任  陈学孟
    中国赫鲁晓夫和他在安徽的代理人李葆华、黄岩之流，为了复辟资本主义的需要，指使陈登科这个反动家伙写了本黑书，叫什么《风雷》。那本黑书又臭又长，尽是胡说八道，它给社会主义抹黑，为资本主义叫好。陈登科这个反动家伙，打着写农业合作化的幌子，污蔑社会主义，宣扬资本主义，可真是泥地里的黑蛇，又毒又滑！
    这本黑书，大刮单干风，说什么单干是“天堂的生活”。
    俺们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席教导我们：“只有社会主义能够救中国。”
    俺们贫下中农尝过单干的苦头。俺们深深懂得：搞单干，就是走资本主义斜路，就是要复辟资本主义。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在安徽的代理人，在安徽大搞“三自一包”、“责任田”，刮单干风，俺们贫下中农就坚决反对。他们宣传“责任田”的“十大好处”，我们就宣传
  “责任田”的十大坏处，还编了顺口溜：“单干好比独木桥，走一步来摇三摇。公社就是通天路，通向共产主义路一条。”理是我们的壮，气是我们的粗，人是我们的多，路是我们的正！
    这本黑书，胡说什么俺们贫下中农“害怕”走社会主义道路。书中有个老贫农出来组织互助组，结果到处碰钉子。他跑弯了腿，说破了嘴，许多贫下中农还是不干，最后把他都气病了。这完全是造谣污蔑！俺们贫下中农最听毛主席的话，走社会主义道路最积极，最坚定。俺们搞合作化、公社化的时候，那劲头可大啦！连日加夜写申请，红彤彤的申请书一张挨一张。广大贫下中农一听说毛主席发号召，大家就向前奔，敲锣打鼓，喜气洋洋，自觉自愿，哪里还有害怕的啊？！
    要说害怕社会主义的人，那倒是有，但不是俺们贫下中农，而是那伙走资派、地、富、反、坏、右分子和他们的总后台中国赫鲁晓夫。
    这些反动家伙为啥要刮单干风呢？为啥要大叫资本主义“好”呢？这也不奇怪。因为他们是代表国民党反动派利益的，是代表资产阶级利益的，是代表地、富、反、坏、右利益的。他们就是妄想搞垮人民公社集体经济，复辟资本主义，使我们回到资本主义老路上去，让俺们重吃二遍苦。这真是白天做梦！
    社会主义好！社会主义就是好！俺们贫下中农走社会主义的道路是走定了。谁要想复辟资本主义，不管他是陈登科还是李登科，不管他是“黑猫”还是“白猫”，俺们的铁拳就要砸碎他的脊梁骨！
