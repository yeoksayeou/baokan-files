The revolutionary committees at all levels in Mian County, Sichuan Province, have been born in the midst of stormy class struggle. They have consistently used Mao Zedong Thought to propagate, organize, and arm the masses, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking. The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is surging forward, and Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized, creating an unprecedentedly good revolutionary situation.

Placing the Study, Implementation, Propagation, and Defense of Mao Zedong Thought at the Forefront of All Work

Comrade Lin Biao has pointed out: "The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important issue. We must focus on the attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought." From the moment of their establishment, the revolutionary committees at all levels in Mian County have been unwaveringly loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They have always placed the study, implementation, propagation, and defense of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work. After the establishment of the county revolutionary committee, the first task was to launch a "Three Loyalties" campaign throughout the county, emphasizing loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The leading comrades of the county revolutionary committee personally led the committee's staff to visit Qiang villages and grassroots units, studying and propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions together with the masses. They emphasized the great significance of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. All levels of revolutionary committees regarded the distribution of Chairman Mao's works as a glorious and sacred task, ensuring that revolutionary books reached every household and sent the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to the hearts of the revolutionary people across the county. Some leading comrades of the county revolutionary committee carried Chairman Mao's portrait, works, and quotations with them when they went to the countryside. The first thing they did upon entering a village was to distribute revolutionary books. From the county to the district, commune, and production brigade, layers of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and distribution points for Chairman Mao's works were established. Some production teams set up study rooms and distribution points for revolutionary books, and red book stands. Due to the close integration of propaganda and distribution, and the mass movement, in the more than five months since the establishment of the county revolutionary committee, the number of Chairman Mao's works distributed was equivalent to the total amount distributed in the seventeen years before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Wu Chunhe, a 60-year-old poor peasant from Dacai Brigade, Dumen Commune, had suffered greatly in the old society and had a deep love for the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Although she was illiterate, she bought the "Four Volumes" and three copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" out of deep proletarian feelings. She said, "Chairman Mao's books are our lifeline, the books that liberate us. Although I can't read, my children can read a sentence to me, and I can follow along." Every morning and evening, the three members of her family sat together, and her youngest daughter taught her to read Chairman Mao's revolutionary books sentence by sentence, persevering every day. Yu Shaoching, a 65-year-old poor peasant from Bieli Brigade, Nanxin Commune, bought a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and often carried it with him. In the evenings, when community members studied, he held the "Four Volumes" and studied seriously. He said, "Mao Zedong's books should be read by future generations, reading them brightens the eyes, widens the heart, clarifies the direction, and boosts the spirit." Many poor and lower-middle peasants regarded studying Mao Zedong Thought as their first need in life. They said, "If you don't read Chairman Mao's books for a day, your heart is anxious; if you don't read them for two days, your eyes are dim; if you don't read them for three days, you lose your direction."

Using Mao Zedong Thought to Promote the Revolutionization of People's Thinking

Following Chairman Mao's instruction that "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," the revolutionary committees at all levels in Mian County have organized extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The county has established over 800 study classes of various types, with more than 80% of the population participating in the study. Many problems have been resolved in these classes. The revolutionary committee of Nanxin Commune organized study classes targeting the active thoughts of cadres, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions to address the issue of some cadres wanting to shirk their responsibilities and not wanting to work, thereby mobilizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the cadres. Members of the revolutionary committee of Hongfeng Commune went to Sujiaping Brigade, where problems were numerous and class struggle was complex, to hold study classes. This raised the awareness of the broad revolutionary masses, uncovered the cover of class struggle, ensured the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, further consolidated the revolutionary great alliance, and established a revolutionary leadership. The broad masses of cadres and community members reflected, "Study classes are truly good; they illuminate the heart, stand firm in the face of storms, and with Mao Zedong Thought in hand, follow the Party with red hearts and firm wills."

While organizing extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the revolutionary committees at all levels also regularly organized community members to hold meetings to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to promote the revolutionization of the thinking of cadres and community members. Revolutionary masses across the region have generally achieved the goal of studying one quotation from Chairman Mao and applying it, integrating study with practice, and seeing immediate results. This has made Mao Zedong Thought increasingly ingrained in people's hearts, creating a moving scene where everyone acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Community members of Hexi Brigade, Dongfeng Commune, study Chairman Mao's quotations collectively before and after work. When evaluating work, they first recite a quotation and use Chairman Mao's teachings to measure their own work attitude and quality. Poor and lower-middle peasants in Hongfeng Commune studied the "Three Articles" and proposed, "Learn from Zhang Zedong, serve the people wholeheartedly; learn from Norman Bethune, be selfless and dedicated; learn from the Old Man Moving Mountains, charge forward in the face of difficulties." They used such bold words to strictly demand of themselves. The broad revolutionary people across the county, with their deep proletarian feelings of love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, consciously insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works every day, achieving the goal of never forgetting to study and apply Chairman Mao's works amidst a thousand busy tasks; never changing the system of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works amidst a thousand changes.

"Transforming one's worldview is a fundamental transformation." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, the broad revolutionary masses across the county used the "Three Articles" as their guiding principle, broke private interests, established public interests, transformed their worldviews, and composed one heroic song after another of the proletarian "public" spirit. Houcun Brigade in Weidong Commune is a remote Qiang village in the county. The 57-year-old old poor peasant Wang Shuiqiang from this brigade carried the "Three Articles" with him every day when he went up the mountain to herd sheep, insisting on studying and herding sheep wholeheartedly for the revolution. In February and March, when the sheep were sick, he slept in the sheep pen, guarding them day and night, and cured the sheep's diseases with herbs. He herded the sheep with the collective in mind, making tools like sieves and bags for the collective while herding. The medicinal herbs he dug up while herding were also all handed over to the collective without asking for compensation. When he heard that the commune's horticultural farm was short of sieves, he quickly made five and sent them over. When the Tuqiao Brigade's land improvement project was short of tools, he also quickly made sixteen sieves and sent them over. When everyone thanked him, he said, "Your difficulties are my difficulties. For the revolution, there is no distinction between you and me. These are what Chairman Mao instructed me to send to you. You should thank him!" He often educated the younger generation, saying, "Only by being unwaveringly loyal to Chairman Mao and following Chairman Mao in the revolution can China avoid changing color." The young woman Yang Chiying from this brigade was a revolutionary vanguard and a pioneer in self-criticism. She worked wholeheartedly for the collective, carrying heavy loads during the day and rushing to fertilize the fields at night, with all her actions starting from "wholeheartedly serving the people" and not calculating personal gains and losses. Such good people and deeds like those in Houcun Brigade are countless across the county.

Using Mao Zedong Thought to Defeat All Class Enemies

"Mao Zedong Thought is the revolutionary science of the proletariat." While leading and organizing the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary committees at all levels closely integrated it with the reality of class struggle, organizing the masses to study and apply it in struggle, using Mao Zedong Thought to defeat all class enemies, and consolidating and developing the newly born revolutionary committees.

After the establishment of the county revolutionary committee, the class enemies, unwilling to die, blew a rightist wind of reversing verdicts, counterattacking the revolutionary people, and attempting to overthrow the newly born revolutionary committee. The county revolutionary committee armed the broad revolutionary masses with Chairman Mao's series of teachings on class struggle, making the broad revolutionary masses remember Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle," enhancing their awareness of the enemy situation. Many commune revolutionary committees specially organized study classes focused on conducting struggles against the enemy, bringing the problems encountered in struggles against the enemy to study Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle. Through study, under the leadership of the revolutionary committees, the broad revolutionary masses firmly grasped the direction of struggle, always directing the struggle at a handful of diehard capitalist-roaders, traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, correctly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions, uniting all revolutionary forces that can be united, and accurately and firmly striking at a handful of class enemies. This defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, defended the achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and promoted the consolidation and development of the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee of Hongying Commune, the capitalist-roaders within the Party, unwilling to admit defeat, secretly sowed discord and created divisions within the revolutionary mass organizations, attempting to overthrow the newly born revolutionary committee. Through organizing extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the revolutionary committee organized the masses to use Mao Zedong Thought to severely criticize the capitalist-roaders, making the masses see clearly and launching a high tide of revolutionary criticism, severely striking at a handful of class enemies. The internal unity of the revolutionary mass organizations was enhanced, and the revolutionary committee was further consolidated and developed. The Red Guards and revolutionary students of Mian County No. 1 Middle School, following Chairman Mao's instruction that "to study Marxism, one must not only learn from books but mainly through class struggle, practical work, and approaching the masses of workers and peasants," brought the problems encountered in class struggle to organize extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They finally exposed the class enemies who blew a rightist wind of reversing verdicts, defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, consolidated the revolutionary great alliance, achieved the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and established the school revolutionary committee.

    大力办好学习班　促进人的思想革命化
    四川茂汶羌族自治县各级革委会把带领广大群众学习、贯彻、宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，人的精神面貌一新，革命形势空前大好
    新华社成都十一日电　四川省茂汶羌族自治县各级革命委员会在阶级斗争的急风暴雨中诞生后，坚持用毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，促进人的思想革命化，全县活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动波澜壮阔，毛泽东思想空前大普及，革命形势空前大好。
    把学习、贯彻、宣传、捍卫毛泽东
      思想放在一切工作的首位
    林副主席指出：“对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题。我们就是要抓对毛主席的态度，对毛泽东思想的态度问题。”茂汶羌族自治县各级革命委员会从诞生之日起，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把学习、贯彻、宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想，始终放在一切工作的首位。县革命委员会建立后，第一件工作就是在全县范围内开展了无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动。县革命委员会负责同志亲自率领革委会工作人员深入到羌寨和基层单位，与群众一起学习、宣传毛主席最新指示，大讲特讲活学活用毛泽东思想的重大意义。各级革命委员会都把发行毛主席著作当作光荣而神圣的任务，把革命宝书发遍千家万户，把战无不胜的毛泽东思想送到全县革命人民的心坎里。县革委会一些负责同志下乡工作时，随身带有毛主席像、毛主席著作和毛主席语录，进村第一件事就是发行革命宝书。从县、区、公社到生产大队，层层都建立了毛主席著作发行机构和毛泽东思想宣传队。有的生产队建立了革命宝书学习室和发行点、红书台。由于宣传、发行紧密结合，大搞群众运动，县革命委员会成立以后五个多月的时间里，发行的毛主席著作即相当于无产阶级文化大革命以前十七年发行量的总和。渭门公社道才大队六十多岁的贫农社员吴春和，在旧社会苦大仇深，她对伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想无限热爱。她虽不识字，却怀着深厚的无产阶级感情买了雄文四卷和三本《毛主席语录》。她说：“毛主席他老人家的书是我们的命根子，是我们翻身求解放的书，我虽然不识字，娃娃读一句我跟着读一句，总是可以学会的。”每天早晚，她全家三口人坐在一起，叫她的小女儿一字一句地教读毛主席的革命宝书，一直坚持不懈。南新公社别立大队六十五岁的贫农社员余少清买了一部《毛泽东选集》，经常书不离身，请人教读。晚上社员学习，他就手捧雄文四卷，很认真地学习。他说：“毛主席的书子孙万代都要读，读了眼睛亮，心头宽，方向明确，干劲足。”许多贫下中农把学习毛泽东思想当做生活的第一需要。他们说：“一天不读毛主席的书心头慌，两天不读毛主席的书眼无光，三天不读毛主席的书走路摸不到方向。”
    用毛泽东思想促进人的思想革命化
    茂汶羌族自治县各级革命委员会遵循毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，大办毛泽东思想学习班。全县已办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班八百余个，参加学习的人占全县人口的百分之八十以上，许多问题在学习班得到了解决。南新公社革委会办学习班，针对干部的活思想，有的放矢地学习毛主席最新指示，解决了部分干部想撂挑子不愿干工作的思想问题，调动了广大干部的革命积极性。红峰公社革委会成员深入到问题多、阶级斗争复杂的苏家坪大队办学习班，提高了广大革命群众的觉悟，揭开了阶级斗争盖子，保证了毛主席最新指示的落实，进一步巩固了革命大联合，建立了革命的领导班子。广大群众和干部反映说：“学习班真是好，斗私批修心眼亮，大风大浪不动摇，毛泽东思想学到手，心红志坚跟党走。”
    在大办毛泽东思想学习班的同时，各级革委会还普遍地组织群众定期召开活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会，用毛泽东思想促进干部和社员群众的思想革命化。各地革命群众，普遍做到了学习毛主席的一条语录就用一条，学用结合，立竿见影，使毛泽东思想日益深入人心，出现了人人按毛主席指示办事的动人局面。东风公社河西大队社员在出工和收工时，都集体学习毛主席语录。评工时先背诵一条语录，用毛主席的教导衡量自己的劳动态度和劳动质量。红峰公社贫下中农学习了“老三篇”，提出：“学习张思德，全心全意为人民；学习白求恩，毫不利己专门利人；学习老愚公，遇到困难往前冲。”他们用这样的豪言壮语，来严格要求自己。全县广大革命人民以对毛主席、对毛泽东思想无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情，自觉地坚持天天学、天天用，做到了千忙万忙，活学活用毛主席著作永不忘；千变万变，活学活用毛主席著作的制度永不变。
      “世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。全县广大革命群众遵循毛主席的教导，以“老三篇”为座右铭，破私立公，改造世界观，谱出了一曲又一曲无产阶级“公”字的凯歌。卫东公社后村大队是全县山高路远的一个偏僻羌寨。这个大队五十七岁的老贫农王水长保，天天上山放牧时都身带“老三篇”，坚持学习，全心全意为革命放羊。二三月间，羊群患病时，他就睡在羊圈里，昼夜守护，用草药治愈羊病。他放牧羊群，心怀集体，边放牧边为集体编制撮箕、背兜等工具。他放羊时挖的药材，也全部交集体，不要报酬。他听说公社园艺场缺撮箕，就赶快编了五个送去。四瓦大队改土工地缺工具，他也赶编了十六个撮箕送去。大家感谢他时，他说：“你们的困难也是我的困难，为革命不分你我，这都是毛主席指示我送来的，你们感谢他老人家吧！”他还经常教育青年一代说：“只有无限忠于毛主席，紧跟毛主席干革命，中国才不会变颜色。”这个大队的女青年杨赤英，革命是先锋，斗私是闯将。她一心为集体操劳，白天劳动带头挑重担，晚上还突击送肥下地，一切行动都以“全心全意地为人民服务”为出发点，不计较个人得失。象后村大队里这样的好人好事，在全县不胜枚举。
    用毛泽东思想战胜一切阶级敌人
      “毛泽东思想是无产阶级的革命科学。”各级革命委员会在领导和组织活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动时，紧密结合阶级斗争实际，组织群众在斗争中学、在斗争中用，用毛泽东思想战胜一切阶级敌人，巩固和发展新生的革命委员会。
    县革命委员会成立后，阶级敌人不甘心死亡，大刮右倾翻案妖风，向革命人民进行反扑，妄图颠覆新生的革命委员会。县革委会用毛主席关于阶级斗争的一系列论述武装广大革命群众，使广大革命群众牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，增强了敌情观念。许多公社革委会专门举办了以开展对敌斗争为内容的学习班，带着对敌斗争中的问题，学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导。通过学习，广大革命群众在革委会的领导下，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，始终把斗争矛头对准一小撮顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，正确区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的革命力量，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人，保卫了毛主席的革命路线，保卫了无产阶级文化大革命的成果，促进了革命大联合、革命三结合的巩固和发展。红鹰公社革委会成立后，党内走资派不甘心失败，暗中在革命群众组织内部挑拨离间，制造分裂，妄图颠覆新生的革命委员会。革委会通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，组织群众用毛泽东思想狠批走资派，使群众擦亮了眼睛，掀起了革命大批判高潮，狠狠打击了一小撮阶级敌人，革命群众组织内部增强了团结，革命委员会也进一步得到了巩固和发展。茂汶一中红卫兵革命小将和革命师生遵循毛主席“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到”的教导，带着阶级斗争中的问题，大办毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛泽东思想，终于揭露出了大刮右倾翻案妖风的阶级敌人，捍卫了毛主席的革命路线，巩固了革命大联合，实现了革命三结合，成立了校革命委员会。
