Workers' Lectures Are the Best

Studying Chairman Mao's great instructions naturally reminds us of the vivid education we received in the practice of the educational revolution.

According to Chairman Mao's teaching of "comparison is necessary to discern," in April of this year, we organized a comparative teaching class in a factory. We had teachers from the school, technicians from the factory, and workers all give the same geometry lesson on triangles. First, a university graduate teacher lectured. Since he taught only theoretical knowledge and principles detached from reality, the students not only found it dry and boring but also didn't understand much. The lecture took 65 minutes. Next, a technical school graduate technician lectured. Since he used about a dozen machine parts and blueprints related to the course, he linked theory with some practical applications. The students found it interesting and understandable, and it took only 26 minutes. Finally, an old worker lectured. He first explained that workers need to manufacture machines and thus must understand blueprints, and to understand blueprints, they must grasp the principles of geometry. He explained the close relationship between learning and mastering geometric principles and China's socialist industrialization. Then, he had the students gather around the machine, operating and explaining while linking the various parts and operations of the machine. Not only did he teach the various knowledge and principles related to triangles, but he also linked and taught a lot of knowledge and principles related to lines, parallel lines, parallelograms, and other geometric concepts. Because theory was closely linked to practice and theory was explained through practice, the students not only found it interesting but also understood and remembered it well. They quickly learned a lot of geometric knowledge and principles, and it took less time. It truly made one feel that "one lecture is worth more than ten years of reading."

The practice of the educational revolution over the past two years has gradually given us the confidence to carry the educational revolution to the end. Chairman Mao's latest great instructions have given us an unprecedentedly powerful force and an unprecedentedly sharp weapon to carry the educational revolution to the end.

Gains from a Year of Practice

Studying Chairman Mao's great instructions on the educational revolution, we look back on the past year. Our school's broad revolutionary teachers and students, guided by Chairman Mao's "May 7th Instructions," have gone to factories and villages to combine with workers and peasants. We feel particularly close to this great instruction.

Over the past year, teachers and students have first learned the proletarian qualities of the workers in the factories, learning their deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. This has strongly promoted ideological revolutionization. A student, during a safety class in the factory, casually said, "Safety classes are nothing; not attending them doesn't matter." A worker heard this and, using his own experiences of being a beast of burden in the old society, deeply explained the difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang's attitudes towards safety classes. A drop of water can reflect the sun's rays, and a small matter reflects the workers' boundless love for Chairman Mao and their immense love for the socialist system. When students talked about their gains from learning, they said: "The working class loves Chairman Mao the most and listens to Chairman Mao the most. To be a revolutionary successor who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, one must take the path of combining with workers and peasants, becoming one with the masses of workers and peasants, to temper clear class feelings, and truly understand Chairman Mao's wisdom and greatness. The more one's ideological transformation progresses, the deeper one's feelings for Chairman Mao become. Through practice, one knows that Chairman Mao's words are truly effective. Participating in labor makes one feel even closer to Chairman Mao." Worker comrades say: "Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, students are completely different from before. In the period when the revisionist educational line was in power, students in the factory did not have work clothes and did not work, but you? You never mentioned work clothes, wearing shirts and still lifting steel bars. Seeing your growth is like seeing the future, like seeing communism!"

Under the guidance and inspiration of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to further criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line politically and ideologically, to create a new proletarian educational system, and to carry the educational revolution to the end.

The Fundamental Direction of Design Work

The great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the educational revolution are also our beacon for carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our design institute. Our design institute was also a place dominated by bourgeois intellectuals. The design power was in the hands of a few people, including a walking capitalist who had once drunk foreign water and his protégés. From the design methods to the organizational structure, everything was done according to foreign dogmas, without mentioning the combination of production labor and the masses of workers and peasants. Everything was decided by so-called chief engineers and experts. However, these so-called "experts" not only had no production practice experience but also had no design practice experience. Most chief engineers had never drawn a design blueprint but were responsible for design. How could they do a good job in design?

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the entire institute, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, exposed and criticized a handful of class enemies who had usurped the leadership of our institute. Chairman Mao's latest instructions further armed our minds, making us understand these class enemies more clearly. We must thoroughly eliminate the poison of the revisionist design line and thoroughly change the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our design institute. We must resolutely follow the revolutionary path of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory pointed out by Chairman Mao, going to the masses of workers and peasants and to production practice. We proletarian revolutionaries not only want to seize political power from the capitalist-roaders but also want to seize the technical power from the bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities."

Victory Lies in Combining with Workers

Seeing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, I feel particularly excited. I am a worker-turned-engineer. Based on my decades of work practice, I deeply feel that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are a great truth.

When I was a worker, I had personally seen: some so-called engineering and technical personnel spent all day in small rooms, from books to books, from materials to materials, and then acted arrogantly on the site. When workers offered opinions on design blueprints, even if they were reasonable, they would still stubbornly say that workers "don't understand science." As a result, many projects could not be completed on time, dismantled and reassembled, reassembled and dismantled, wasting workers' labor and national property, truly burdening the people and wasting resources. Seeing these situations, I was very distressed.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's scientific and technological line, I decided, based on my decades of practical experience, to diligently study theory and combine it with practice, constantly improving myself. After becoming an engineer, I always remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "the masses are the real heroes." I often stay with the masses of workers. When I don't understand something, I ask the workers. Many problems that I couldn't solve by racking my brains were quickly resolved after consulting the workers. Therefore, in the projects I have led, most of them were completed on time. This is all the result of Chairman Mao's scientific and technological line guiding us.

Chairman Mao instructs me to act, and Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance. Chairman Mao's latest instructions are a great encouragement and whip to me. I will definitely strive to study and deeply understand this great instruction and contribute my strength to carrying the educational revolution to the end.

Labor Practice Produces Scientific and Technological Talents

The broad masses of cadres and soldiers of the direct organs of the Engineering Corps welcomed the publication of the latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao with unprecedented excitement and the most enthusiastic cheers.

The great transformation of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory is a bouquet of flowers blooming under Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. It shines with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, pointing out a bright path for cultivating engineering and technical personnel.

The path of cultivating engineering and technical personnel in the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory fully illustrates that intellectuals must put down their airs, learn from workers and peasants, and humbly learn from workers and peasants and from practice. Only then can they "discover, invent, create, and progress." The working class dares to think, dare to speak, dare to do, and dare to create, and is the most revolutionary in spirit. Although their book knowledge may be much less than that of some intellectuals, they have Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon. Relying on their rich practical experience, they can create any miracle in the world. Our Engineering Corps' active learner and practitioner of Mao Zedong Thought, model cadre of a certain regiment's mechanical section, Comrade Lü Jilan, is a typical example in this regard. This son of a poor peasant has never attended school for a day. However, relying on a loyal heart to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, he learned and mastered the technology of repairing guns and cannons in the hard years of war. On the post of building national defense projects, he went deep into the front line of construction, actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, not believing in "experts" and "authorities," innovating and creating with the soldiers, and achieving great results. Practice has proven: "The most intelligent and talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." This is an unshakable great truth. As the editorial note of the People's Daily points out: "The great creative power of the people will continue to create miracles that bourgeois mediocrities and right-wing conservatives cannot imagine."

Workers and Peasants Should Be the Masters of Science and Technology

Chairman Mao's latest great instructions speak our hearts' words, greatly boosting the morale of the proletariat and greatly dampening the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. We enthusiastically support and resolutely carry out these instructions.

"Education must serve proletarian politics, and education must be combined with productive labor," this is Chairman Mao's consistent educational thought. However, Liu Shaoqi has always opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and vigorously promoted the revisionist educational line and scientific research line. For many years, he has kept the broad masses of workers and peasants with practical experience out of the school gates, making them powerless in the field of science and technology, serving so-called "experts" and "authorities." He has allowed those intellectuals cultivated under the bourgeois educational line to become "officials" as soon as they leave school, standing above workers and peasants with rich practical experience, obstructing the development of the creative wisdom of the broad masses of workers and peasants. Chairman Mao's latest instructions have pronounced the death sentence on the bourgeois educational line and scientific and technological line, opening up a new path for the industrial and scientific and technological revolutions of workers and peasants. The broad masses of workers and peasants not only stand up politically but also want to be the masters in the field of science and technology. Chairman Mao's latest instructions have shown us a magnificent picture of the impending prosperous development of the industrial and scientific and technological revolutionary great leap forward. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as revolutionary intellectuals, will firmly grasp the great power of education and science and technology, fully display their great creative power, and create great miracles for the new industrial and scientific and technological revolution.

Chairman Mao Spoke Our Hearts' Words

Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the educational revolution spoke the hearts' words of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We must have proletarian politics in command, select students from workers and peasants with practical experience, and cultivate revolutionary technical personnel. This is the urgent demand of us poor and lower-middle peasants.

In the evil old society, poor and lower-middle peasants had no right to study science and technology. After liberation, Liu Shaoqi vigorously promoted bourgeois "experts" and "authorities," keeping a large number of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants with practical experience out of the gates of science and technology. Liu Shaoqi's tricks are completely for his need to restore capitalism. We poor and lower-middle peasants have long seen through his wolfish ambitions. Now Chairman Mao has shown us the direction to advance. We must resolutely smash the bourgeois educational system and establish a new proletarian educational system, cultivating a scientific and technological team that serves proletarian politics.

We Hate the Revisionist Educational Line to the Core

We are the guards at Tiananmen Square, standing by Chairman Mao's side. We have boundless love for Chairman Mao's educational line and profound hatred for the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line led by Liu Shaoqi. The schools under the rule of the revisionist educational line are not for the working people. They do not cultivate successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause but successors of revisionism.

In the past, schools had students sitting in classrooms all day, reading books, chewing on theories, and digging into theories, all for the purpose of "fame and fortune." After a few years of study, students became "bookworms" who did not understand peasants, did not understand workers, and did not know about class struggle; they became "spiritual aristocrats" who were detached from proletarian politics, detached from the masses of workers and peasants, detached from production practice, and stood above the working people. Regarding this, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants once angrily criticized: "The more books one reads, the more stupid one becomes, and it is of no use to us working people." This is a strong indictment of the bourgeois educational system promoted by the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements led by Liu Shaoqi.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The school system must be shortened, and education must be revolutionized," "Reform the old educational system, reform the old teaching policies and methods," "We must thoroughly change the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has pronounced the complete failure of Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line. We must thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational line, thoroughly break the bourgeois educational system, establish a proletarian educational system, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's educational line, and carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end!

    打破资产阶级旧教育制度  坚决同广大工农兵相结合
    工人同志讲的课就是好
    学习毛主席的伟大指示，很自然地就联想起我们在教育革命实践中受到的一次生动的教育。
    根据毛主席“有比较才能鉴别”的教导，今年四月间，我们在一个工厂组织了一次教学比较课，让学校的教师、工厂的技术员和工人分别给同学讲同样一节几何课，内容讲的都是三角形。首先是大学毕业的教师讲，由于讲的都是脱离实际的知识和原理，学生不但听得枯燥无味，而且还听不大懂，时间却费了六十五分钟。其次是中专毕业的技术员讲，由于他拿着十几种同课程有关的机器零件和图纸，理论联系了一定的实际，学生们听起来有兴趣，也听得懂，才用了二十六分钟。最后是一个老工人讲，他首先就讲了工人要制造机器，就得会看图，要会看图，就得懂得几何原理的道理，说明学习和掌握几何原理同我国社会主义工业化的密切关系。然后，让学生围在机器旁边，边操作，边讲解，联系机器上的各式零件和各种操作，不但讲了有关三角形的各种知识和原理，还联系着讲了不少有关直线、平行线、平行四边形等其他几何学上的知识和原理，由于理论密切联系实际，透过实践说明理论，学生不但听得兴味盎然，而且听得很懂，记得也牢，很快就学到了许多几何方面的知识和原理，时间却用得少。真使人有“听讲一次课，胜读十年书”之感。
    两年来教育革命的实践，使我们逐渐树立起把教育革命进行到底的信心，毛主席最近的伟大指示，更给了我们把教育革命进行到底的无比强大的动力和无比锐利的武器。

    一年实践中的收获
    学习毛主席关于教育革命的伟大指示，回顾一年来，我校广大革命师生沿着毛主席的“五·七”指示指引的航道，到工厂、农村同工人农民相结合的经历，我们对这一伟大指示感到特别亲切。
    一年来，师生们在工厂中首先学习的是工人们无产阶级的思想品质，学习他们对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的深厚的无产阶级感情，有力地促进了思想革命化。有一位同学在工厂上安全课时，漫不经心地说：“安全课没什么，不上也不要紧。”工人师傅听到了这句话，就用自己在旧社会做牛做马的亲身经历，深刻地说明了“有没有安全课，反映了共产党同国民党的不同作风”的道理。一滴水可以反映出太阳的光辉，一件小事反映工人阶级对毛主席的无限深情，对社会主义制度的无比热爱。同学们谈到学习的收获时说：“工人阶级最热爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话，要做无限忠于毛主席的革命接班人，必须走同工农兵相结合的道路，和工农群众融为一体，才能锻炼出爱憎分明的阶级感情，才能真正体会到毛主席的英明和伟大。思想改造有一分成绩，对毛主席的感情就加深一分，经过实践更知毛主席的话儿真灵，参加劳动倍觉毛主席亲又亲。”工人同志讲：“无产阶级文化大革命以来，学生与过去大不一样了。以前在修正主义教育路线统治时期，学生到工厂没有劳动服不干活，可你们呢？从没提过什么劳动服，穿着衬衣照样抬锈钢筋，看到你们的成长，就象看到了未来，看到了共产主义！”
    在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的指引和鼓舞下，我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步从政治上、思想上批判反革命修正主义教育路线，创造无产阶级崭新的教育制度，把教育革命进行到底。

    设计工作的根本方向
    伟大领袖毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示，也是我们设计院进行斗批改的指路明灯。我们设计院过去也是被资产阶级知识分子所统治的地方，设计大权掌握在一个曾到美国喝过洋水的走资派及其包庇下的少数人手里。从设计方式一直到组织机构，都是按洋教条办，根本不提与生产劳动相结合、与工农群众相结合的问题。什么事情都由一些所谓总工程师老爷和专家们说了算。但是，这些所谓“专家”，不但没有生产实践经验，就是设计的实践经验也没有。大部分总工程师连一张设计图都没有画过，却在那里负责设计，怎么能搞好设计呢？
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，全院无产阶级革命派在支左解放军的大力支持下，把一小撮窃踞了我院领导权的阶级敌人揪了出来，对修正主义的设计路线进行了深入的揭发和批判。毛主席最新指示的发表，进一步武装了我们的头脑，使我们对这一小撮阶级敌人认识得更清楚了。我们一定要彻底肃清修正主义设计路线的流毒，彻底改变资产阶级知识分子统治我们设计院的现象，坚决走毛主席所指出的上海机床厂的革命道路，到工农群众中去，到生产实践中去。我们无产阶级革命派不但要在政治上夺走资派的权，而且要在技术上夺资产阶级反动学术“权威”的权。
            化工部第一设计院无产阶级革命派
    同工人结合无往而不胜
    看到毛主席的最新指示，我感到特别兴奋。我是一个工人出身的工程师。我根据几十年的工作实践，深刻地体会到，毛主席的最新指示是千真万确的伟大真理。
    我当工人的时候，曾经亲眼看到：有的所谓工程技术人员，成天钻在小房子里，从书本到书本，从资料到资料，到了现场又大摆其官架子。工人对设计图案提出意见，明明合情合理，可他还红着脸，硬着头皮说工人“不懂科学”。结果使得好多工程不能按时完成，拆了又装，装了又拆，浪费了工人的劳动，浪费了国家的财产，真是劳民伤财。看到这些情况，我非常痛心。
    在毛主席的科技路线指引下，我下决心根据自己几十年的实践经验，刻苦地钻研理论，并在实践中和工人相结合，检验自己学到的理论是否正确，不断提高自己。当了工程师以后，我牢记伟大领袖毛主席“群众是真正的英雄”的伟大教导，经常和工人群众在一起。有不懂的地方，我就向工人请教，有好多问题自己绞尽脑汁也想不出办法，但一经请教工人，问题就很快得到解决。因此，在我主持搞的一些工程中，大部分都能按时完成任务。这都是毛主席的科技路线指引的结果。
    毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。毛主席的最新指示，对我是个极大的鼓舞和鞭策，我一定要努力学习和深刻领会这一伟大指示，为把教育革命进行到底而贡献自己的力量。

    劳动实践出科技人材
    我们工程兵直属机关广大指战员，以无比兴奋的心情，最热烈地欢呼我们伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的发表。
    上海机床厂的伟大变革，就是毛主席革命路线盛开的一束鲜花。它闪烁着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，为培养技术工作人员指出了光明大道。
    上海机床厂培养工程技术人员的道路，充分说明，知识分子只有放下架子，拜工农为师，老老实实向工人农民学习，向实践学习，才能“有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”。工人阶级敢想、敢说、敢干、敢创造，最富有革命精神，尽管他们的书本知识可能比一些知识分子少得多，但是，他们有了毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，凭着他们丰富的实践经验，什么人间奇迹都可以创造出来。我们工程兵活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子标兵、某团机械股长吕纪兰同志，就是这方面的一个典型例子。这个贫农的儿子，没有进过一天学校。但是，他凭着一颗忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的革命路线的赤胆忠心，在艰苦的战争岁月里，学习和掌握了修枪修炮的技术。在建设国防工程的岗位上，他深入施工第一线，活学活用毛泽东思想，不迷信“专家”、“权威”，同战士在一起搞革新创造，获得很大成绩。事实证明：“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”。这是一个颠扑不破的伟大真理。也正如《人民日报》编者按所指出的那样：“人民群众的伟大创造力量，将不断创造出为资产阶级庸人和右倾保守主义者所意想不到的奇迹。”
                                          工程兵
    工农要作科技的主人
    毛主席最新的伟大指示，说出了我们的心里话，大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。我们热烈拥护，坚决执行。
      “教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”，这是毛主席一贯的教育思想。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫一贯反对毛主席的革命路线，极力推行修正主义的教育路线和科研路线。多年来，把广大有实践经验的工人农民拒绝于学校大门之外，使他们在科技方面处于无权的地位，让他们为所谓“专家”、“权威”服务。而让那些在资产阶级教育路线上培养出来的知识分子，走出校门就做“官”，高踞于有丰富实践经验的工人农民之上，阻碍着广大工人农民创造智慧的发展。毛主席的最新指示，宣判了资产阶级教育路线和科技路线的死刑，为工农业革命和科技革命开辟了崭新的道路。广大的工人农民不仅在政治上翻了身，而且要作科技方面的主人。毛主席的最新指示，为我们展现了一幅即将到来的蓬勃发展的工农业生产大革命的壮丽图画。广大的工农兵以及革命知识分子将要牢牢掌握教育和科技大权，充分发挥伟大的创造力量，为新的工农业革命创造伟大的奇迹。

    毛主席说出了我们的心里话
    毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示，说出了俺贫下中农的心里话。要无产阶级政治挂帅，从有实践经验的工人、农民中选拔学生，培养革命的技术人员，这是俺贫下中农的迫切要求。
    在万恶的旧社会，贫下中农根本没有学习科学技术的权利。解放后，中国赫鲁晓夫大肆吹嘘资产阶级
  “专家”、“权威”，把大批心红眼亮有实践经验的工人、贫下中农关在科学技术大门之外。中国赫鲁晓夫这一套，完全是为了他复辟资本主义的需要。俺贫下中农早就看透了他的狼子野心。现在毛主席给我们指明前进的方向，我们一定要坚决砸烂资产阶级的教育制度，创立无产阶级崭新的教育制度，培养为无产阶级政治服务的科学技术队伍。
          河南沁阳县北孔大队负责人　宋学义
    我们恨透了修正主义教育路线
    我们是天安门前守卫在毛主席身边的警卫战士。我们对毛主席的教育路线充满着无限的爱，对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的反革命修正主义教育路线充满了刻骨的仇恨。修正主义教育路线统治的学校，不是为劳动人民服务的。它不是培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人，而是培养修正主义的接班人。
    过去的学校，学生整天坐在教室里死读书，啃书本，钻理论，其目的就是“成名成家”。学生读几年书以后，就成了不了解农民，不了解工人，不知道阶级斗争的“书呆子”；成了脱离无产阶级政治，脱离工农群众，脱离生产实践，高踞于劳动人民之上的“精神贵族”。对此，广大贫下中农曾满腔怒火地批评说：
  “书读的越多越蠢，对咱们劳动人民没有用处。”这是对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的反革命修正主义分子所推行的资产阶级教育制度的强烈控诉。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“学制要缩短，教育要革命”，“改革旧的教育制度，改革旧的教学方针和方法”，“必须彻底改变资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象”。无产阶级文化大革命宣判了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线的彻底破产。我们一定要狠批修正主义的教育路线，彻底打破资产阶级的教育制度，建立无产阶级教育制度，坚决执行毛主席的教育路线，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底！
