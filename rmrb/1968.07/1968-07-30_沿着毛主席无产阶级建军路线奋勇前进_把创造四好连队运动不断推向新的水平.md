Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, the People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, implementing the entire set of political military-building principles proposed by Vice Chairman Lin based on Chairman Mao's military line, and focusing on building the grassroots. The entire army's construction of being highly proletarianized and highly combat-ready has made a new leap, with significant improvements in class struggle, two-line struggle awareness, and military technology. In defending the socialist motherland and carrying out tasks such as "three supports, two military actions," the broad masses of soldiers and officers have demonstrated an extremely powerful combat effectiveness, achieved brilliant victories, and created outstanding merits.

In the past year, the most distinctive feature of the various units' focus on grassroots construction has been to cultivate units that are absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as the most fundamental task, making Chairman Mao's proletarian military line deeply rooted in the units. Many old excellent units, using the "three loyalties" as a strict standard for self-discipline, have continuously created new excellence and achieved new merits in the new year; some units that had not been rated as excellent in the past have striven to enhance their awareness of the "three loyalties" and have entered the ranks of excellent units. Various units have emerged with a batch of units like the heroic Fourth Platoon, who say, "Chairman Mao loves me, I love Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao supports me, I support Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao instructs me, I act accordingly; Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance." They have also emerged with many soldiers like the good cadre Dan He, who is loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and Li Wenzhong, the model for supporting the left and loving the people. Whether in the forefront of "three supports, two military actions," in the battles to defend national defense and the Cultural Revolution, or in combat readiness training and production construction, they have all demonstrated the lofty quality of fighting for Chairman Mao and sacrificing for Chairman Mao, showing the great revolutionary spirit of the army's soldiers and officers, "Absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, our resolve is unshakable even if the seas dry up and the rocks crumble." In factories, rural areas, and offices executing support-left tasks, many units have followed Chairman Mao's great teachings that the army is a "revolutionary political task force" and enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "support the broad masses of the left." In the extremely complex and sharp class struggles, they have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, assisted the revolutionary masses, and held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, promoting the great alliance of the revolutionary left, achieving the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and making the revolution and production thrive. Soldiers and officers executing military training tasks have actively propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions and, together with revolutionary teachers and students, have vigorously carried out the education revolution. Military representatives participating in various levels of revolutionary committees have firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fully playing the role of the strong pillar of the People's Liberation Army, and making outstanding contributions to consolidating and developing the newly born revolutionary committees at various levels. Soldiers and officers fighting on the front lines of coastal and border defense have, with their hearts absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, defended Chairman Mao, defended the Cultural Revolution, and defended the socialist motherland. No matter whether the enemy comes from the air or the sea, they will not escape their annihilating strikes. Units responsible for production and construction have turned the construction sites into large classrooms for studying Mao Zedong Thought, learning politics, military affairs, and culture, engaging in labor and production, mass work, and participating in the cultural revolution to criticize bourgeois ideology at any time, making both revolution and production vibrant.

The great leader Chairman Mao has always attached great importance to strengthening the construction of grassroots units in the army. As early as the initial period of our army, Chairman Mao deeply pointed out that "the foundation of the army lies in the soldiers" and stipulated that "the party branch should be established at the company level." Chairman Mao often, with his personal introduction of the experience of a cooperative, a factory, a school, or a company, set the highest and most brilliant example for us to personally focus on grassroots construction. Vice Chairman Lin creatively applied Mao Zedong Thought, based on Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, proposed a series of principles emphasizing political military building, advocated the movement to create excellent units, and pushed the army's grassroots construction to a new stage. In the new situation of the Cultural Revolution, the entire army, from the headquarters to the companies, has repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, increasingly deeply realizing that whether or not to firmly and unshakably carry forward the movement to create excellent units and focus on grassroots revolutionary construction is a fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao's military line, a major issue concerning whether the army's revolutionary traditions can be passed down from generation to generation, and whether the army can successfully complete the political tasks of defending national defense and "three supports, two military actions." They have deeply felt that the grassroots are the first line of revolution, combat, production, and work. The grassroots have a large number of cadres and soldiers, are places where achievements, situations, experiences, and new things emerge, and are places where the infinite creative power of the masses is hidden. To make work have discoveries, creations, and progress, we must definitely focus on grassroots construction. The leadership organs and cadres of the Navy, Air Force, Beijing, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Jinan, Wuhan, Lanzhou, Fuzhou, Kunming, Chengdu units, and the Xinjiang and Tibet Military Regions have, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, regarded connecting with the masses and strengthening grassroots construction as the starting point and foothold of the headquarters' work. No matter how busy the headquarters' work is, they always allocate a large number of headquarters cadres to go deep into the grassroots, solve problems on the spot, and implement face-to-face leadership. The Party Committee of a certain unit, a red flag for defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and a model unit for studying Chairman Mao's works in the Navy, regards helping the grassroots implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as the central task of the Party Committee. They often maintain that more than two-thirds of the personnel go deep into the grassroots, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought with the soldiers, and fight against selfishness and revisionism together, effectively promoting the progress of grassroots revolutionary construction.

The leadership organ of a certain regiment in the Guangzhou unit, which created more than sixty "how to" methods for grasping living thoughts, regards the company's work as a measure of whether the headquarters' work is solid or not, and regards going deep into the companies and focusing on grassroots construction as the top priority of the leadership organ, often checking the situation of the movement to create excellent units with the company cadres and soldiers, setting up models, and promoting experiences to continuously advance the movement to create excellent units.

In the process of focusing on grassroots construction, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers have all focused their main energy on vigorously strengthening the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, carrying out two-line struggle education, and striving to improve the awareness of line struggle. They say that in the new historical period of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the struggle between the two classes and two roads is prominently manifested as the struggle between the two lines within the party. Firmly executing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the current greatest political issue, the great principle of the revolution, and the primary sign of ideological revolutionization. The most fundamental aspect of strengthening grassroots construction is to firmly grasp the central link of improving the awareness of line struggle. Under this ideological guidance, the entire army's soldiers and officers, with the problems in the two-line struggle, have studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, especially studied and applied Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and a series of latest instructions on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, pushing the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new height. The Air Force and Navy units have, in the past year, deeply implemented Vice Chairman Lin's instruction to raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, extensively and deeply carried out the "three loyalties" activities of being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, using various forms to extensively study and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, sing and praise Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practices, greatly arousing the deep proletarian feelings of love and loyalty to Chairman Mao among the broad masses of soldiers and officers, and enhancing the high awareness of loyally executing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Everyone regards Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle for everything, regards loyalty to Chairman Mao as the soul of life and the standard for conduct, and thus the army's combat effectiveness has greatly improved. In the past year's multiple air battles, they have frequently reported victories, consecutively shooting down and damaging ten enemy aircraft, showing the prowess of heroes who are absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "One of our important tasks on the ideological front is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." The broad masses of soldiers and officers in various units have, while focusing on grassroots construction, remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, with fighting passion, held a gun in one hand and a pen in the other, and actively participated in the two-line struggle. Using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, they have carried out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism of Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line and the bourgeois military line of the revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, making Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line deeply rooted in the units and making the army's ideology meet the needs of executing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The leadership cadres of a certain artillery regiment in the Beijing unit and its subordinate regiments have, in accordance with Vice Chairman Lin's instruction that "the army's work involves countless matters, but as long as we vigorously study and apply Chairman Mao's works and focus on two-line education, all problems can be solved," personally led the soldiers and officers to the great classroom of two-line struggle in factories and rural areas to participate in the struggle, receive education, and training. In the Peach Garden Brigade, they, together with poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, fiercely criticized Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small clique." They also invited old workers from the Third Cotton Mill in Tianjin to the unit to denounce the capitalists' crimes of exploiting and oppressing workers in the old society, fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi's fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious," greatly arouse the broad masses of soldiers and officers' boundless love for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, enhance their deep hatred for Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line, and improve their awareness of carrying out two-line struggle in the new situation. A certain machine gun company, at the time of fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in Jiangxi, came to Anfuxian in the Jingan Mountain area to carry out "three supports, two military actions" work. The entire company was highly dispersed in more than sixty units such as party, government, finance, and culture in the county, and more than twenty-one people's communes within a radius of hundreds of miles, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary masses and making the county's revolution and production thrive. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, in the fiery struggle practice, they have been tempered and improved their awareness of two-line struggle, learning the skills of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. The soldiers and officers of a certain company stationed in the Dulong River area on the southwestern border of the motherland, although far away from Beijing across thousands of rivers and mountains, have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and firmly executed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line with their loyal hearts. Here, across two major rivers and two snow-capped mountains with an altitude of more than five thousand meters, there are seven months of snow-covered mountains in a year. However, the snow can block the high mountains but cannot block the soldiers' loyal hearts of following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and firmly executing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the unprecedented Cultural Revolution, they, together with the revolutionary masses of the Dulong and Nu ethnic groups here, ignited the flames of class struggle, set up revolutionary criticism battlefields everywhere in the fields, bamboo houses, and by the fireside, deeply criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, eliminated its poison, and let the spring breeze of Mao Zedong Thought blow through every mountain and valley in the Dulong River area. The soldiers and officers of the "Red Ninth Company," a model unit for studying Chairman Mao's works in a certain unit of the Shenyang unit, have, in the long-term struggle against Liu Shaoqi and the revisionist element Luo Ruiqing, with their loyal and red hearts to the great leader Chairman Mao, braved the storms and waves, courageously defended Mao Zedong Thought, and defended Chairman Mao's proletarian military line. In the stormy Cultural Revolution, they have, on the front line of "three supports, two military actions," enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought, implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the revolutionary left, and further improved their awareness of two-line struggle. When they summarized their experiences of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the great waves of class struggle, they pointed out that to continuously improve the awareness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and adapt to the needs of the changing situation and tasks, one must "find problems in the line struggle, find the cause in the worldview, find the answer in Chairman Mao's works, and see the effect in actual actions," grasp the big principles, touch the soul, and continuously change the worldview in the struggle practice.

Vice Chairman Lin instructs us: "In the past few decades, the most important things we have done are these few: do a good job in political and ideological work, do a good job in style, do a good job in training, and do a good job in life management.... Our army construction cannot do without good grassroots units, and to do a good job in grassroots units, we cannot do without these four things." The broad masses of soldiers and officers in various units have, in the process of strengthening grassroots construction, always firmly and unshakably followed Chairman Mao's guideline of "grasp the revolution, promote production, work, and combat readiness" and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on the four goods to arrange the company's work, doing it with priorities, always putting political and ideological work in the first place, using good political and ideological work to lead the "three goods" of style, military training, and life management, and, with the changing situation and tasks, continuously giving new content and new requirements to the four goods in accordance with Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, making Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions thoroughly implemented and fully realized in the four goods, and continuously pushing the movement to create excellent units to a new level.

    沿着毛主席无产阶级建军路线奋勇前进
    把创造四好连队运动不断推向新的水平
    解放军指战员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗贯彻林副主席的一整套政治建军原则狠抓基层建设
      全军非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的建设，出现了新的飞跃，阶级斗争、两条路线斗争觉悟和军事技术获得极大的提高。广大指战员在保卫社会主义祖国和执行“三支”“两军”等任务中，发挥出无比强大的战斗力，取得了辉煌的胜利，创建了卓越的功勋
    新华社二十九日讯　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大进军中，中国人民解放军广大指战员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚定不移地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级建军路线和林副主席根据毛主席的建军路线提出的一整套着重政治建军的方针原则，狠抓基层建设，把创造四好连队运动提高到了一个新的水平。全军非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的建设，出现了新的飞跃，阶级斗争、两条路线斗争的觉悟和军事技术水平，获得了极大的提高。广大指战员意气风发，斗志昂扬，沿着伟大统帅毛主席的无产阶级建军路线奋勇前进，在保卫社会主义祖国和执行“三支”“两军”等各项任务中，发挥出无比强大的战斗力，取得了辉煌的胜利，创建了卓越的功勋。
    一年来，各部队狠抓基层建设的最大特色，是把培养无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的四好连队和五好战士作为最根本的任务，使毛主席的无产阶级建军路线在连队深深扎根。许多老的四好连队，以“三忠于”的标准严格要求自己，在新的一年中连创四好，又立新功；一些过去没有评上四好的单位，努力提高“三忠于”的自觉性，跨进了四好连队的行列。各部队都涌现出了一批象英雄四排那样“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进”的四好单位，涌现出了许多象“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”门合、“支左爱民模范”李文忠那样的五好战士。他们不论是在“三支”“两军”第一线，在保卫国防、保卫无产阶级文化大革命的战斗中，还是在战备训练、生产施工中，都表现了生为毛主席而战斗，死为毛主席而献身的崇高品质，显示了我军指战员“无限忠于毛主席，海枯石烂志不移”的伟大革命精神。在工厂、农村、机关执行支左任务的许多部队，遵照毛主席关于我军是“执行革命的政治任务的武装集团”的伟大教导，热烈响应毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，在极其复杂尖锐的阶级斗争中，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，协助广大革命群众，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，促进了无产阶级革命派的大联合，实现了革命的“三结合”，把革命和生产搞得轰轰烈烈。执行军训任务的指战员，积极宣传毛主席的最新指示，和革命师生并肩大闹教育革命。参加各级革命委员会的军队代表，坚定地站在毛主席无产阶级革命路线一边，充分发挥了人民解放军的坚强柱石作用，为巩固和发展各级新生的革命委员会作出了突出的贡献。战斗在海防、边防前哨的指战员，怀着无限忠于毛主席的赤胆忠心，保卫毛主席，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫社会主义祖国，不管敌人从空中来，还是从海上来，都逃不脱他们歼灭性的打击。担负生产施工的连队，把生产施工的现场，办成学习毛泽东思想的大课堂，学政治，学军事，学文化，既从事劳动生产，又从事群众工作，又随时参加批判资产阶级的文化革命斗争，革命、生产都呈现出一派朝气蓬勃的气象。广大指战员满怀革命豪情庄严表示，忠于毛主席就是理想，就是前途，就是幸福，就是胜利。我们一定要手中高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，脑里铭刻战无不胜的毛泽东思想，脚步走在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，一生一世热爱毛主席，紧跟毛主席，忠于毛主席！
    伟大领袖毛主席历来极其重视加强部队的基层建设。早在我军初创时期，毛主席就深刻地指出“军队的基础在士兵”，规定“支部建在连上”。毛主席经常以他亲自介绍一个合作社、一个工厂、一个学校、一个连队的经验的伟大革命实践，为我们树立了亲自狠抓基层建设的最高和最光辉的典范。林副主席创造性地运用毛泽东思想，根据毛主席的无产阶级建军路线，提出了一系列着重政治建军的方针原则，倡导了创造四好连队运动，把我军基层建设推向了一个崭新的阶段。在无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下，全军从机关到连队，反复学习毛主席的伟大教导和林副主席的指示，越来越深刻地认识到，是不是坚定不移地进一步开展四好连队运动，狠抓基层革命化建设，是对毛主席建军路线的根本态度问题，是关系到我军的革命传统能不能代代相传，关系到我军能不能胜利完成保卫国防和“三支”“两军”等项政治任务的大问题。他们深有体会地说，基层是革命第一线，战斗第一线，生产第一线，工作第一线。基层有广大的干部战士，是出成果、出情况、出经验、出新鲜事物的地方，是蕴藏着群众无穷创造力的地方。要使工作有所发现，有所创造，有所前进，就一定要把基层建设抓好。海军、空军、北京、沈阳、广州、南京、济南、武汉、兰州、福州、昆明、成都部队以及新疆、西藏军区的许多部队的领导机关和领导干部，遵照毛主席的教导和林副主席的指示，把联系群众，加强基层建设，看作机关工作的出发点和落脚点，不管机关工作多忙，都要抽出大量机关干部，扎根基层，就地发现问题，解决问题，实行面对面的领导。英勇捍卫毛主席革命路线的一面红旗、海军学习毛主席著作标兵单位某部党委，把帮助基层落实毛主席的最新指示，贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，作为党委的中心工作，他们经常保持三分之二以上的人员深入基层，同战士一起活学活用毛泽东思想，一起斗私批修，有力地推动了基层革命化建设的进程。
    创造抓活思想六十多个“怎么办”的广州部队某团领导机关和领导干部，把连队工作作为检验机关工作过硬不过硬的尺子，把深入连队、狠抓基层作为领导机关的头等大事来做，经常同连队干部战士一起，检查四好连队运动开展的情况，树立典型，推广经验，促使四好连队运动不断前进。
    在狠抓基层建设的过程中，广大干部战士都把主要精力放在大力加强活学活用毛主席著作，搞好两条路线斗争教育，努力提高路线斗争觉悟上。他们说，在无产阶级专政下继续革命的新的历史时期，两个阶级、两条道路的斗争，突出地表现为党内两条路线的斗争。坚决执行和捍卫毛主席的革命路线，是当前最大的政治，是革命的大节，是思想革命化的首要标志。加强基层建设，最根本的，就是要紧紧掌握提高路线斗争觉悟这个中心环节。在这种思想指导下，全军指战员带着两条路线斗争中的问题，活学活用毛泽东思想，特别是活学活用毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、政策和一系列最新指示，把活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动推向了新的高峰。空军、海军部队，一年来，深入贯彻林副主席把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新阶段的指示，广泛深入地开展了无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动，运用各种形式大学大用毛主席的光辉思想，大歌大颂毛主席的伟大革命实践，大大激发了广大指战员对毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，增强了忠实执行、誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线的高度自觉性。人人都以毛泽东思想统帅一切，把忠于毛主席当作生命的灵魂，言行的准则，因而部队战斗力大大提高。他们在一年来的多次空战中，捷报频传，连续击落击伤敌机十架，显出了无限忠于毛主席的英雄战士的威风。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”各部队广大指战员在狠抓基层建设中，牢记毛主席的教导，满怀战斗激情，一手拿枪，一手拿笔，积极投身到两条路线斗争中去。以毛泽东思想为武器，对中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，对反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿的资产阶级军事路线，展开了深入持久的革命大批判，使毛主席的无产阶级革命路线在连队深深扎根，使部队的思想符合执行和捍卫毛主席革命路线的需要。北京部队炮兵某师及其所属各团领导干部，遵照林副主席关于“部队工作千头万绪，只要大力活学活用毛主席著作，抓好两条路线教育，一切问题就可以迎刃而解”的指示，亲自带领指战员到工厂、农村两条路线斗争的大课堂里，去参加斗争，接受教育和锻炼。他们在桃园大队，和贫下中农、革命干部一起狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。他们还邀请天津第三毛纺厂的老工人来部队，控诉旧社会资本家剥削压迫工人的滔天罪行，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”的谬论，大大激发了广大指战员对毛主席革命路线的无比热爱，增强了对中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线的刻骨仇恨，提高了在新形势下进行两条路线斗争的觉悟。某部机枪连，在江西两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈搏斗的时刻，来到井冈山地区的安福县担任“三支”“两军”工作。全连高度分散在县城党、政、财、文等六十多个单位和方圆数百里的二十一个人民公社，和广大革命群众并肩战斗，把全县的革命、生产搞得热火朝天。他们在毛泽东思想的指引下，在火热的斗争实践中，得到了锻炼，提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟，学到了在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的本领。驻守在祖国西南边疆独龙河地区的某部一连指战员，和北京远隔万水千山，但他们紧跟毛主席寸步不离。这里和内地横隔着两条大江和海拔五千多米的两座雪山，一年中有七个月大雪封山。但是，大雪能封住高山，封不住战士们紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，坚决执行毛主席革命路线的赤胆忠心。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，他们和这里的独龙族、怒族革命群众点燃起阶级斗争的熊熊烈火，在田边地角、竹楼里、火塘边，到处摆下革命大批判的战场，深入批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，肃清它的流毒，让毛泽东思想的春风吹遍了独龙河地区的每一座高山峡谷。沈阳部队某部“学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”的指战员，在同中国赫鲁晓夫及反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿的长期斗争中，以无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆红心，顶狂风，战恶浪，勇敢地捍卫了毛泽东思想，捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级建军路线。在无产阶级文化大革命的急风暴雨中，他们又在“三支”“两军”第一线，满腔热情宣传毛泽东思想，和无产阶级革命派一起落实毛主席的最新指示，两条路线斗争的觉悟又有了新的提高。他们总结在阶级斗争的大风大浪中活学活用毛泽东思想的经验时指出，要想不断提高对毛主席革命路线的觉悟，适应形势任务发展的需要，必须“从路线斗争中找问题，从世界观上找原因，从毛主席著作里找答案，从实际行动中看效果”，狠抓大节，猛触灵魂，不断在斗争实践中改造世界观。
    林副主席指示我们：“我们几十年搞过来搞过去，最重要的事情还是这几样：搞好政治思想工作，搞好作风，搞好训练，搞好生活管理。……我们部队建设不把基层单位搞好不行，要搞好基层单位不搞好这四样也不行。”各部队广大指战员，在加强基层建设的过程中，始终坚定不移地遵照毛主席“抓革命、促生产、促工作、促战备”的方针和林副主席关于四好的指示去安排连队工作，做到有主有次，把政治思想工作永远放在首位，以政治思想好统帅三八作风、军事训练、生活管理这“三好”，并且随着斗争形势和任务的变化，在四好的四个方面都按照毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，不断赋予新的内容，提出新的要求，使毛主席的一系列最新指示，在四好的四个方面彻底贯彻，全面落实，把创造四好连队运动不断推向新的水平。
