The Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, the Council of Ministers of Albania, and the Tirana City Committee of the Party of Labour held a grand rally with 20,000 participants in the capital's "Qemal Stafa" Stadium on the evening of July 9 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the glorious People's Army of Albania.

The great leader of the Albanian people, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, Comrade Enver Hoxha, attended the meeting.

Also present were: Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Albania, Haxhi Lleshi, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Mehmet Shehu, and other party and state leaders: Beqir Balluku, Hysni Kapo, Ramiz Alia, Kadri Hazbiu, and others.

A large portrait of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people, hung on the podium of the "Qemal Stafa" Stadium in Tirana. Large banners reading "Long Live the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania led by Comrade Enver Hoxha!" and "Long Live the People's Republic of Albania!" were displayed on the stands. The national flag of Albania and red flags fluttered in the wind.

Members of the People's Army of Albania, veteran guerrillas from the National Liberation War, workers, cadres, families of martyrs, students, and Young Pioneers, all in high spirits, gathered at the meeting venue.

The meeting was presided over by Comrade Mehmet Shehu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and Chairman of the Council of Ministers. In his opening remarks, Shehu said: Our people are celebrating the anniversary of the People's Army because our army comes from the people, fights for the people, and is united with the people. This army is the indestructible armed force of our revolution and proletarian dictatorship, the loyal and powerful defender of our socialist homeland.

He said, the Party and the government pay special attention to comprehensively and continuously strengthening our armed forces. Today, our army has grown into a revolutionary, modern, regular army. This army is tempered in thought, has excellent cadres loyal to the Party's line and the people's cause; it takes Marxist-Leninist military science as its fundamental principle, places human factors above weapons, and ideological work above technology. It is armed with the military art of people's war.

Comrade Shehu warned that if the enemy dares to invade the sacred borders of our socialist homeland, then our People's Army, under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha, will unite with the armed people like steel, defeat the enemy's attack, and annihilate the enemy in the boundless flames of people's war, even if it is a powerful enemy.

Comrade Muftiu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, delivered a speech on behalf of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour, the Council of Ministers, and Comrade Enver Hoxha. Muftiu reviewed the glorious history of the development and growth of the People's Army. He said: Our glorious National Liberation Army was born and grew strong in the struggle for national liberation, created among the uprising people. Relying on their own strength and armed with the Party's ideology, the uprising people took up arms and fought, defeating the Italian and German fascist occupiers and the traitors in our own country.

Muftiu pointed out that in the flames of the people's revolution, the Party educated and trained our People's Army with a lofty spirit of proletarian internationalism. After our country's liberation, our People's Army, under the leadership of the Party, has honorably fulfilled its sacred mission, resolutely defending our country's freedom and independence and the fruits of the revolution.

Muftiu said that in recent years, the Party and the government have taken measures to further revolutionize the army, such as establishing party committees in the army, establishing political commissars, and abolishing the rank system, enabling the army to better fulfill its mission.

Muftiu said that today, our Party and people are fighting to further deepen the socialist revolution in all fields, which is primarily a class struggle aimed at consolidating proletarian dictatorship, defending socialism and communism, and achieving the victory of socialism and communism. Under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Party of Labour of Albania has theoretically studied the issue of blocking the dangers of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in our country and has implemented many measures in practice. This is a great contribution to the treasury of Marxism-Leninism and assistance to the common cause of the world revolutionary proletariat.

Muftiu said that our military and civilians are an indivisible whole. They jointly defend the victory of the revolution. Our Party implements the Marxist-Leninist principle of arming and militarily training the masses, making the defense of the motherland the cause of the entire people.

Muftiu said that the struggle of our Party and people to build and defend socialism in Albania is part of the struggle against the imperialism led by the United States and the modern revisionism of Khrushchev and Tito, which conspires against the freedom and independence of the peoples of all countries, against socialism and communism.

In discussing the excellent international situation, Muftiu said that the great Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the great Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong, have achieved brilliant victories and successfully carried out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, smashing the imperialist and modern revisionist conspiracies to restore capitalism in China. The People's Republic of China today has become a powerful pillar for the struggle of the peoples of all countries seeking liberation and independence and the world revolutionary forces.

He said, our Party and people sincerely congratulate the great victories achieved by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. Our Party and people will always maintain the sincere and fighting friendship between our two peoples and parties. This friendship is increasingly strengthening in the common revolutionary struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism and in the struggle for the victory of socialism and communism throughout the world.

He said, the more imperialism and modern revisionism feel that their end is near, the more brutal they become. The recent "Non-Proliferation Treaty" manipulated by the United States and the Soviet Union in the United Nations is a new great conspiracy against the peoples of all countries. Therefore, exposing the Soviet-American alliance and fighting against it is one of the fundamental tasks of the peoples of all countries, Marxist-Leninist parties and groups.

Muftiu said that the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania calls on the soldiers and officers of the People's Army to work unceasingly, raise their political and ideological level, master Marxist-Leninist science, and master the teachings of our Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha. Marxist-Leninist science and the teachings of the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha are our strength and an invincible source.

Before Comrade Muftiu delivered his speech to the meeting, Comrade Beqir Balluku, Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Defense of Albania, also spoke at the meeting.

Balluku emphasized that in the armed struggle for national liberation, our people followed the Marxist-Leninist principle that the people must use armed struggle to counter aggression and foreign occupation, and must respond to the counter-revolutionary actions of the bourgeoisie and reactionaries with the armed revolutionary actions of the working masses. The Party's ideas have deeply rooted themselves in the hearts of our working masses and their growing armed forces.

He said that in the historical period of the development of our socialist revolution and under the current world situation, our Party and government have taken measures to further modernize the armed forces and ensure the uninterrupted development of our free country's security and socialist revolution.

Balluku emphasized that in our country, if necessary, every citizen is ready to take up arms. All invaders who dare to touch us, even a little, will be smashed and annihilated in the storm of our victorious people's war. Our country is not isolated. Her friends and supporters are all over the world. The great, glorious Communist Party of China, led by the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong, and the seven hundred million Chinese people are marching forward with us side by side.

Balluku said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong has achieved great victories. These victories have brought boundless joy and inspiration to our people and our Party.

Balluku said that under the education and leadership of the Marxist-Leninist parties of our two countries, Comrade Enver Hoxha and Comrade Mao Zedong, our two countries' revolutionary armed forces have always marched forward side by side, maintaining an invincible fighting friendship, to fully frustrate and smash the plans of imperialism-revisionism aggression and to defend our common cause.

Balluku said that the heroic Vietnamese people are giving heavy blows to American imperialism in their armed struggle. Our people, our Party, and government support and will continue to support the just struggle of the brotherly Vietnamese people.

Balluku finally said that our people are united like steel around the Party and, under the leadership of the Party, are working with one hand holding a pickaxe and the other holding a gun to fulfill the grand tasks set by the Fifth Congress of the Party to realize the Fourth Five-Year Plan, to deepen the ideological, cultural, scientific, and technological revolutions, to strengthen proletarian dictatorship, to enhance the country's defensive capabilities, and to advance the great cause of socialism and communism.

Comrade Shehu's opening remarks, Comrade Muftiu's speech, and Comrade Balluku's speech were repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause and shouts of slogans.

The meeting also adopted a telegram of greeting to the Central Committee of the Party of Labour and the Council of Ministers.

After the meeting, a grand song and dance evening was held. At the end of the evening, the entire audience stood up and enthusiastically applauded and cheered for Comrade Enver Hoxha and other party and government leaders on the podium: "Party, Enver, we are always ready!" "Long Live the Party of Labour!"

On July 9, military and civilian rallies were also held in Durres, Dibra, Gjirokaster, Shkodra, Pukë, Korça, Mirdita, and Fier to enthusiastically celebrate the 25th anniversary of the founding of the People's Army of Albania.

    地拉那盛大集会庆祝人民军建军二十五周年

    谢胡同志致开幕词　穆夫蒂乌同志代表劳动党中央、部长会议和霍查同志致贺词
    巴卢库同志强调阿中两国人民和革命武装力量在反帝反修斗争中并肩前进
    新华社地拉那十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会、阿尔巴尼亚部长会议和劳动党地拉那市委员会，九日晚上在首都“捷马尔·斯塔发”体育场举行有两万人参加的盛大集会，隆重庆祝光荣的阿尔巴尼亚人民军建立二十五周年。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记霍查同志出席了大会。
    参加大会的还有：阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团主席列希、部长会议主席谢胡，以及党和国家其他领导人：查尔查尼、巴卢库、努什、托斯卡、穆夫蒂乌、阿利雅、马尔科、科列加、凯莱齐、哈兹比乌、蒂奥多西、杜米、皮里斯特里、佩扎、斯巴修、莫伊修、佩奇和恰科等。
    地拉那“捷马尔·斯塔发”体育场的主席台上挂着阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志的巨幅画像。体育场看台上挂着巨幅标语：“以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会万岁！”“阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国万岁！”阿尔巴尼亚国旗和红旗迎风招展。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军指战员、民族解放战争期间的老游击队员、工人、机关干部、烈士家属、学生和少先队员等，精神抖擞地来到大会会场。
    大会由阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议主席谢胡同志主持。谢胡在开幕词中说：我国人民庆祝人民军建军节，因为我们的军队来自人民，为人民而战斗，同人民团结在一起。这支军队是我国革命和无产阶级专政的不可摧毁的武装力量，是我们社会主义祖国的忠实的强大的保卫者。
    他说，党和政府特别关怀全面地、不断地加强我国武装部队。今天，我国军队已经成长为一支革命化的、现代化的正规军队。这支军队在思想上经受了锻炼、具有忠于党的路线和人民事业的优秀干部；它以马克思列宁主义军事科学为根本原则，把人的因素放在武器之上、把思想工作放在技术之上，它是用人民战争的军事艺术武装起来的。
    谢胡同志警告说，如果敌人敢于侵犯社会主义祖国的神圣边境，那末，我国人民军将在劳动党和统帅霍查同志的领导下，同武装起来的人民钢铁般地团结在一起，打败敌人的进攻，在无边无际的人民战争的烈火中消灭敌人，即使它是强大的敌人。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员穆夫蒂乌同志代表劳动党中央委员会、部长会议和霍查同志向大会致贺词。穆夫蒂乌回顾了人民军发展壮大的光荣历史。他说：我国光荣的民族解放军是在争取国家解放的斗争中诞生和成长壮大起来的，是在起义的人民中创建起来的。依靠自己的力量和以党的思想武装起来的起义人民，手执武器，进行斗争，打败了意大利和德国法西斯占领者和本国的卖国贼。
    穆夫蒂乌指出，在人民革命的烈火中，党以崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神教育和培养了我们的人民军。在我国解放后，我们的人民军在党的领导下，光荣地履行了自己的崇高使命，坚决捍卫我国的自由和独立以及革命的成果。
    穆夫蒂乌说，近年来，党和政府为军队的进一步革命化所采取的措施，如在军队中建立党委会、建立政治委员、取消军衔制等，使军队能更好地完成她的任务。
    穆夫蒂乌说，今天，我们党和我国人民为在一切领域中进一步深入开展的社会主义革命所进行的斗争，首先是一场阶级斗争，其目的在于巩固无产阶级专政，保卫社会主义和共产主义，使社会主义和共产主义取得胜利。在霍查同志领导下的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党从理论上研究旨在堵塞在我国产生修正主义和复辟资本主义的危险的道路问题，并为此在实践中贯彻许多措施，这是对马列主义宝库所作出的一个巨大贡献，是对世界革命的无产阶级的共同事业的援助。
    穆夫蒂乌说，我国军民是一个不可分的整体。他们共同保卫革命的胜利。我们党实行对人民群众进行武装和军事训练的马克思列宁主义的原则，使保卫祖国成了全体人民的事业。
    穆夫蒂乌说，在阿尔巴尼亚建设和保卫社会主义的斗争是我们党和我国人民正在对阴谋反对各国人民的自由和独立，反对社会主义和共产主义的以美国为首的帝国主义、赫鲁晓夫和铁托现代修正主义进行的斗争的组成部分。
    穆夫蒂乌在谈到大好的国际形势时说，伟大的中国人民在中国共产党和伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志的领导下，取得了辉煌的胜利，并且成功地进行了无产阶级文化大革命，粉碎了帝国主义和现代修正主义在中国复辟资本主义的阴谋。中华人民共和国今天已经成为争取解放和独立的各国人民和世界革命力量进行斗争的强大支柱。
    他说，我们党和我国人民衷心祝贺中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大胜利，我们党和我国人民将永远维护我们两国人民和我们两党之间的真挚的战斗友谊。在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的共同的革命斗争中，在争取社会主义和共产主义在全世界胜利的斗争中，这种友谊正日益增强。
    他说，帝国主义和现代修正主义越是感到自己的末日快要来临，它们就越是残暴。最近美苏操纵联合国炮制的“防止核扩散条约”，是反对各国人民的新的大阴谋，因此，揭露苏—美联盟并与之斗争，是各国人民、各国马克思列宁主义政党和小组的根本任务之一。
    穆夫蒂乌说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会号召人民军指战员不断工作，提高政治思想水平，掌握马列主义科学、掌握我们党和霍查同志的教导。马列主义科学、党和霍查同志的教导是我们的力量和不可战胜的源泉。
    在穆夫蒂乌同志向大会致贺词之前，阿尔巴尼亚部长会议副主席、国防部长巴卢库同志也在大会上讲了话。
    巴卢库强调说，在争取民族解放的武装斗争中，我国人民遵循着这样的马克思列宁主义原则：人民必须以解放武装斗争来对付侵略和外国占领，必须以劳动群众的武装革命行动来回答资产阶级和反动派的反革命行动。党的这些思想，已经在我国劳动群众及其正在成长发展的武装力量的心灵中扎下了深根。
    他说，在我国社会主义革命发展的历史时期，在当前世界局势下，我们党和政府采取了进一步使武装部队现代化、保障我们自由祖国的安全和社会主义革命不间断发展的措施。
    巴卢库强调说，在我国，如果需要的话，每一个公民都是随时准备拿起武器的战士。所有一切侵略者如果胆敢触动我们，那怕是触动一点点，都必将在我国胜利的人民战争的风暴中被粉碎和歼灭。我国不是孤立的。她的朋友和支持者遍天下。以毛泽东同志为首的伟大、光荣的中国共产党领导下的七亿中国人民，和我们并肩前进。
    巴卢库说，由杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了伟大的胜利。这些胜利使我国人民和我们党感到无限的欢欣鼓舞。
    巴卢库说，在我们两国马克思列宁主义党、恩维尔·霍查同志和毛泽东同志的教育和领导下，我们两国革命武装力量为了全部挫败和粉碎帝国主义—修正主义的侵略计划，为了保卫我们的共同事业始终并肩前进，保持着不可战胜的战斗友谊。
    巴卢库说，英雄的越南人民在他们的武装斗争中，正在给美帝国主义以沉重的打击。我国人民、我们的党和政府支持并将继续支持兄弟的越南人民的正义斗争。
    巴卢库最后说，我国人民钢铁般地团结在党的周围，并在党的领导下，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，正在为执行党的第五次代表大会所规定的实现第四个五年计划的宏伟任务，为深入开展思想、文化革命和科学、技术革命，为加强无产阶级专政，为增强祖国的防御能力，以推进社会主义和共产主义的伟大事业而努力。
    谢胡同志的开幕词、穆夫蒂乌同志的贺词和巴卢库同志的讲话不断为热烈的掌声和口号声所打断。
    大会还通过了给劳动党中央委员会和部长会议的致敬电。
    大会结束以后，举行了盛大的歌舞晚会。晚会结束时，全场起立向主席台上的霍查同志和其他党政领导人热烈鼓掌欢呼：“党、恩维尔，我们时刻准备着！”“劳动党万岁！”
    九日，都拉斯、迪勃拉、吉诺卡斯特、斯库台、普克、科尔察、米尔迪塔和发罗拉等地区的军民也分别举行集会，热烈庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民军建立二十五周年。
