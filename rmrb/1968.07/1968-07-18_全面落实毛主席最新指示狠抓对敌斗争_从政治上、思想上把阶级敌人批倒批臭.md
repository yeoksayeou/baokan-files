The Revolutionary Committee of Beijing First Machine Tool Factory, under the close attention of the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Deputy Chairman Lin, and with the enthusiastic assistance of the military supporting the left, led all the revolutionary workers of the factory to earnestly implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. They combined the struggle against the enemy with the revolutionary criticism, exposing a small group of unrepentant capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries hidden within the revolutionary ranks. They washed away the muddy water of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and the old Beijing Municipal Committee's counter-revolutionary revisionist clique within the factory. The revolutionary workers are more enthusiastic, more consciously studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, more resolutely carrying out the struggle against the enemy and revolutionary criticism, consolidating and developing the newly born Revolutionary Committee, and consolidating and developing the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary and production situation in the entire factory is excellent.

Implementing Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions to Intensify the Struggle Against the Enemy

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes in the condition of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Beijing First Machine Tool Factory is one of the key enterprises in Beijing's industrial front. In the past, the old Beijing Municipal Committee's counter-revolutionary revisionist clique promoted the entire set of revisionist enterprise lines of Chinese Khrushchev here. They colluded with a small group of unrepentant capitalist roaders within the party, placing a group of spies, traitors, and other counter-revolutionaries in various departments, controlling the party, government, finance, and cultural power within the factory. Therefore, the class struggle within the factory is extremely sharp and complex, essentially a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries.

After the proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory won the power seizure struggle and established the Revolutionary Committee, they have been repeatedly struggling with various class enemies. The Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the military supporting the left, together with the broad revolutionary workers, earnestly studied and implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. They became more clear-eyed, increasingly recognizing the great significance of this political revolution. They said: "Chairman Mao points out the direction of our struggle, making us clear about the essence of the struggle. We do as Chairman Mao says." The broad revolutionary masses were spirited, enthusiastic, united, and continuously and vigorously carried out the struggle against the enemy, exposing a small group of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and other counter-revolutionaries hidden in various corners of the factory, further uncovering the cover of class struggle within the factory.

Revolutionary Criticism Enhanced the Workers' Consciousness in the Struggle Against the Enemy

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the course of the movement, there are new things ahead, and new things are endless. Studying the overall situation and development of this movement is a major subject that we must always pay attention to." As the struggle against the enemy deepened, the Revolutionary Committee and the military comrades discovered: some workers had the thought of "focusing on struggle but not on criticism, focusing on the new but not on the old," that is, focusing on struggle meetings but neglecting criticism meetings; having great enthusiasm for struggling with newly exposed class enemies but less enthusiasm for continuing to criticize class enemies exposed in the past. Some even thought: as long as a class enemy is exposed, he becomes a "dead tiger," whether to criticize or not doesn't matter, after all, "the mudskipper in the ditch can't cause big waves." The Revolutionary Committee and the military comrades timely analyzed and studied these active thoughts. They realized that this thought was essentially a reflection of a purely military viewpoint and also a reflection of a complacent and arrogant attitude.

To solve this ideological problem, the Revolutionary Committee held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and together with revolutionary workers, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's theories, lines, policies, and principles on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They reviewed Chairman Mao's great teachings on "the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated into the party, government, army, and various cultural circles are a group of counter-revolutionary revisionists, who, once the time is ripe, will seize power, turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." The broad revolutionary workers further clearly recognized: to carry out this political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end, it is not just about exposing a small group of class enemies and considering it done. It is also necessary to criticize them politically, ideologically, and theoretically deeply and thoroughly, to overthrow and expose them. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out revolutionary criticism more deeply and widely, without relaxing for a moment, and to combine revolutionary criticism with the cleansing of the class ranks. Exposing a class enemy means to thoroughly overthrow him, linking him to the root of Chinese Khrushchev. Only in this way can the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries and their representative be uprooted, and their counter-revolutionary revisionism spread in various aspects be eliminated.

Members of the Revolutionary Committee and military comrades also went deep into workshops and teams to do in-depth and detailed ideological mobilization work, studying with revolutionary workers how to combine revolutionary criticism with the struggle against the enemy in terms of methods and approaches. They publicly displayed the crimes of a small group of class enemies exposed, such as anti-party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, classified and displayed them, and then linked them respectively to Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist cadre line of "factionalism and betrayal," and the theory of "class struggle extinction," and then criticized them item by item. In this way, the broad revolutionary workers could more specifically see that a small group of class enemies hidden in the revolutionary ranks were the social basis for Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism; Chinese Khrushchev was their representative at the upper level. In this way, the broad revolutionary workers also realized that this struggle against the enemy was a continuation and deepening of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines during the transitional period of socialism, thereby arousing their hatred for a small group of class enemies and their representative Chinese Khrushchev, greatly enhancing their consciousness in the struggle against the enemy.

In this factory, during the exposure and criticism of a counter-revolutionary's malicious attacks on the Great Leap Forward and the socialist system, his diary written in a covert manner was taken out and displayed on the spot, and criticized paragraph by paragraph. Revolutionary workers exposed his malicious intentions. When everyone sternly questioned him why he did this, this bad guy had to lower his head and confess: "This is determined by my counter-revolutionary stance." This made the broad revolutionary workers see more clearly the reactionary nature of the Kuomintang and understand more deeply that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was a continuation of the long-term struggle with the Kuomintang reactionaries. Two workers angrily stood up, pointing at the counter-revolutionary and saying: "Chinese Khrushchev's theory of 'class struggle extinction' is essentially to let you counter-revolutionaries carry out restoration activities, intending to numb our will and disarm us." The criticism meeting immediately turned into a battlefield to denounce Chinese Khrushchev. Everyone used the criminal facts of the exposed class enemies to expose and criticize Chinese Khrushchev.

The Struggle Against the Enemy Enriched the Content of Revolutionary Criticism

Revolutionary criticism enhanced the workers' consciousness in the struggle against the enemy, exposing a small group of deeply hidden class enemies from various corners. At the same time, the in-depth struggle and exposure of this small group of class enemies also enriched the content of revolutionary criticism, making it more deeply and widely carried out. In addition to holding large and medium-sized criticism meetings, revolutionary workers especially emphasized holding small-sized criticism meetings at the team and squad levels. The forging workshop held revolutionary criticism at the team and squad levels, with good results. Once, in a small-sized criticism meeting held in this workshop, the crimes of a counter-revolutionary were exposed. An old worker jumped up in anger, using his own blood-stained family history in the old society to angrily denounce the heinous crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries and Chinese Khrushchev, and enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's great achievements in leading the Chinese people to rise up and make a revolution. At that time, the entire venue was filled with indignation, severely criticizing the counter-revolutionary with heinous crimes and a small group of capitalist roaders within the party who had long protected him, displaying the great power of the dictatorship of the masses.

The Revolutionary Committee of the First Machine Tool Factory, in the process of combining the struggle against the enemy with revolutionary criticism, always paid attention to going deep among the masses, concentrating the wisdom of the masses, summarizing the experiences created by the masses, and promptly promoting them. They summarized the good experience of the forging workshop holding small-sized criticism meetings and immediately promoted it throughout the factory, promoting the entire factory to quickly form a wave of team and squad criticism. This small-sized criticism meeting based on teams and squads had fewer people, more opportunities to speak, concentrated criticism firepower, and sharp and profound criticism content. Many workers who rarely spoke at large meetings also actively spoke at team and squad meetings. In this way, the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary workers to participate in revolutionary criticism and the struggle against the enemy was fully mobilized. They also combined large, medium, and small criticism meetings, and brought revolutionary criticism to the residential areas, carrying out criticism activities with the workers' families, making a small group of class enemies stink both within the factory and among the families; at the same time, making more people receive education on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, raising class consciousness. The broad revolutionary workers became more enthusiastic in criticism, more red-hearted, more loving towards Chairman Mao, more loving towards Mao Zedong Thought, and more hating towards Chinese Khrushchev.

Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line Further Penetrated the Hearts of the People

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution.... Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." The practical experience of combining the struggle against the enemy with revolutionary criticism at Beijing First Machine Tool Factory once again proved the great truth of "without destruction, there can be no construction." Revolutionary criticism thoroughly suppressed the arrogance of a small group of class enemies and greatly boosted the morale of the broad revolutionary workers; it thoroughly criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Chinese Khrushchev; it firmly established Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Revolutionary criticism further swept away various bourgeois and exploiting class ideologies, popularizing the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The broad revolutionary workers more consciously and firmly defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, more trusted, supported, and cherished the factory Revolutionary Committee. Now, the Revolutionary Committee of the First Machine Tool Factory is gradually establishing proletarian revolutionary authority and is becoming the command center leading the broad revolutionary workers in class struggle. Anyone who maliciously attacks the Revolutionary Committee will immediately face the strong resistance and resolute refutation of the revolutionary workers. The broad revolutionary workers say: the Revolutionary Committee is good, good because it holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, believes in, relies on, and leads the masses, grasps revolutionary criticism, grasps the struggle against the enemy, and grasps revolution to promote production.

Now, the entire factory has a new look. The broad revolutionary workers firmly guard their production posts and insist on making a revolution during their spare time. After work, one can see groups of people sitting together learning Chairman Mao's works and earnestly criticizing and reforming themselves in every corner of the factory area. The small-sized criticism meetings held in the rooms are both serious and lively. The broad revolutionary workers are determined to turn this factory into a great school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

Combining the struggle against the enemy with revolutionary criticism greatly mobilized people's enthusiasm, promoting the great development of production. After the establishment of the factory Revolutionary Committee, the production volume of the entire factory in the second quarter increased significantly compared to the first quarter. Various workshops continuously appeared with technological innovation projects. Some products that had been stagnant at the original level for sixteen years also showed signs of improvement. The broad revolutionary workers, full of confidence in victory, said: we will fulfill the pledge of "Chairman Mao supports us, and we will make Chairman Mao proud." We will carry out revolutionary criticism in depth and for a long time, vigorously and solidly carry out the great mass movement of "grasp revolution, promote production," and strive for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    北京第一机床厂把清理阶级队伍和革命大批判结合起来
    全面落实毛主席最新指示狠抓对敌斗争
    从政治上、思想上把阶级敌人批倒批臭
    大破了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，大立了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，大灭了一小撮阶级敌人的反动气焰，大长了广大革命职工的志气
    本报讯　北京第一机床厂革命委员会，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀下，在支左解放军的热情帮助下，率领全厂广大革命职工，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，把对敌斗争和开展革命大批判紧密结合起来，揭露了隐藏在革命队伍里的一小撮死不改悔的走资派、叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子，冲刷了中国赫鲁晓夫和旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团散布在厂内的封建主义、资本主义和修正主义的污泥浊水。广大革命职工斗志昂扬，更加自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，更加坚决地开展对敌斗争和革命大批判，巩固和发展了新生的革命委员会，巩固和发展了无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。全厂革命和生产形势一片大好。
    落实毛主席的最新指示狠抓对敌斗争
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”北京第一机床厂是北京市工业战线的重点企业之一。过去，旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团，在这里大肆推行中国赫鲁晓夫的一整套修正主义办企业的路线。他们和工厂的党内一小撮死不改悔的走资派串通一气，在各部门安插了一批特务、叛徒和其他反革命分子，控制了厂里的党、政、财、文大权。因此，厂里的阶级斗争非常尖锐、复杂，实质上就是“中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续”。
    这个工厂的无产阶级革命派取得夺权斗争的胜利，并建立革命委员会以后，一直在同各种阶级敌人进行反复的较量。厂革命委员会在支左解放军的帮助下，和广大革命职工一起，认真学习和落实了毛主席的一系列最新指示。他们更加心明眼亮，越来越认清了这场政治大革命的重大意义。他们说：“毛主席给我们指出斗争的方向，使我们明确了斗争的实质。毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做。”广大革命群众精神抖擞，斗志昂扬，团结一致，持续地猛烈地开展对敌斗争，把长期隐藏在厂内各个角落里的一小撮叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派和其他反革命分子揭发了出来，进一步揭开了工厂阶级斗争的盖子。
    革命大批判提高了群众对敌斗争自觉性
    毛主席教导我们：“运动在发展中，又有新的东西在前头，新东西是层出不穷的。研究这个运动的全面及其发展，是我们要时刻注意的大课题。”随着对敌斗争的深入发展，厂革委会和解放军同志发现：部分职工中出现了“重斗不重批，重新不重老”的思想，就是重视开斗争会，忽视开批判会；对新揭露出来的阶级敌人斗争劲头很大，继续批判过去揭露出来的阶级敌人劲头小。个别人甚至认为：阶级敌人只要一揪出来，就变成了“死老虎”，批不批没啥，反正“阴沟里的泥鳅翻不起大浪”。革委会和解放军同志，及时对这些活思想，认真地作了分析研究。他们认识到，这种思想，实质上是一种单纯军事观点的反映，也是一种轻敌麻痹思想的反映。
    为了解决这种思想问题，革委会举办了毛泽东思想学习班，和革命职工一起反复学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，重温毛主席关于“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政”的伟大教导，广大革命职工进一步明确地认识到：要把这一场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底，绝不只是把一小撮阶级敌人揪出来就算完事了，还必须从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批深、批透，批倒、批臭。因此，必须更深入、更广泛地开展革命大批判，一时一刻也不能放松，并且要把革命大批判和清理阶级队伍紧密结合起来。揭露出一个阶级敌人，就要把他彻底批倒，一直联系到中国赫鲁晓夫这一个根子上。只有这样，才能把国民党反动派残渣余孽和他们的总代表连根拔掉，肃清他们散布在各方面的反革命修正主义。
    革委会成员和解放军同志，还深入到车间、班组，做深入细致的思想发动工作，和革命职工一起研究革命大批判如何同对敌斗争紧密结合的方式和方法。他们把揪出来的一小撮阶级敌人的反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的罪行，分类示众，并且把它们分别和中国赫鲁晓夫结党营私、招降纳叛的反革命修正主义干部路线、“阶级斗争熄灭”论挂上钩，然后逐条进行批判。这样做，就使广大革命职工更具体地看清了一小撮隐藏在革命队伍中的阶级敌人，就是中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的社会基础；中国赫鲁晓夫就是他们在上层的代表。这样做，也使广大革命职工认识到，这一场对敌斗争，就是在社会主义过渡时期两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的继续和深化，从而激发了对一小撮阶级敌人和他们的总代表中国赫鲁晓夫的仇恨，大大提高了对敌斗争的自觉性。
    这个工厂一次在揭发批判一个反革命分子恶毒攻击大跃进和社会主义制度的罪行时，把他用隐晦的手法编写的日记当场拿出来示众，逐篇进行剖解批驳。革命职工一针见血地戳破他的恶毒用心。当大家严词责问他为什么这样做时，这个坏家伙不得不低头认罪说：“这是我的反动立场决定的。”这就使广大革命职工更加看清了国民党的反动本质，更加懂得了无产阶级文化大革命就是和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续。两个工人愤怒地站起来指着这个反革命分子说：“中国赫鲁晓夫的‘阶级斗争熄灭’论，实质上是叫你们这些反革命分子进行复辟活动，就是妄想麻痹我们的意志，解除我们的武装。”批判会立刻变成声讨中国赫鲁晓夫的战场。大家用揪出来的阶级敌人的罪恶事实，对中国赫鲁晓夫进行了大揭发、大批判。
    对敌斗争充实了革命大批判的内容
    革命大批判提高了广大革命职工对敌斗争的自觉性，把一小撮深藏的阶级敌人从各个角落里挖了出来。同时，对这一小撮阶级敌人的深入斗争和揭露，又充实了革命大批判的内容，使之更深入、更广泛地开展下去。革命职工除了开大、中型批判会外，特别强调以班、组为单位，开小型批判会。锻工车间以班、组为单位，进行革命大批判，效果很好。有一次，在这个车间召开的小型批判会上，揭发了一个反革命分子的罪行，一个老工人气得跳了起来，当场用自己在旧社会的血泪斑斑的家史，愤怒控诉了国民党反动派和中国赫鲁晓夫的滔天罪行，热情颂扬了毛主席领导中国人民翻身闹革命的丰功伟绩。当时全场群情激愤，狠狠批判了这个罪行累累的反革命分子和长期包庇他的一小撮党内走资派，发挥了群众专政的巨大威力。
    第一机床厂革委会在对敌斗争和革命大批判相结合的过程中，始终注意深入群众，集中群众的智慧，总结群众创造的经验，及时予以推广。他们总结了锻工车间开小型批判会的好经验，马上在全厂宣传推广，促使全厂迅速出现了班、组批判的热潮。这种以班、组为基础的小型批判会，人数少，发言机会多，批判火力集中，批判内容尖锐、深刻。许多平时在大会上很少发言的老工人，也在班、组会上积极发言。这样，就充分地调动了广大革命职工参加革命大批判和对敌斗争的积极性。他们还把大、中、小批判会结合起来，又把革命大批判搬到家属区，和职工家属一起开展批判活动，把一小撮阶级敌人在厂内和家属中都批得很臭；同时使更多的人受到阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的教育，提高阶级觉悟。广大革命职工愈批劲愈大，心愈红，更加热爱毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想，更加仇恨中国赫鲁晓夫。
      毛主席的革命路线更加深入人心
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。……破字当头，立也就在其中了。”北京第一机床厂把对敌斗争和革命大批判结合起来进行的实践经验，再一次证明了“不破不立”的伟大真理。革命大批判大灭了一小撮阶级敌人的气焰，大长了广大革命职工的志气；大破了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线；大立了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。革命的大批判进一步扫除了形形色色的资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的思想，普及了战无不胜的毛泽东思想。广大革命职工更加自觉、更加坚定地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，更加信任、更加支持、更加爱护厂革命委员会。现在，第一机床厂革委会逐步建立起无产阶级革命权威，正在成为带领广大革命职工进行阶级斗争的指挥部。谁要恶意攻击革命委员会，就会立即遭到革命职工的有力抵制和坚决批驳。广大革命职工说：革命委员会好，好就好在她高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，相信、依靠和带领群众，抓革命大批判，抓对敌斗争，抓革命促生产。
    现在，全厂气象一新，广大革命职工坚守生产岗位，坚持业余时间闹革命。下班后，厂区到处可以看到一堆堆人围坐在那里学习毛主席著作，认真地斗私批修；屋子里的小型批判会开得既严肃又生动。广大革命职工，决心把这个工厂办成活学活用毛泽东思想大学校。
    把对敌斗争和革命大批判结合起来，极大地调动了人的积极因素，推动了生产的大发展。厂革委会成立后，全厂在第二季度的生产量，比第一季度有大幅度增长。各车间技术革新项目不断出现。有的产品，十六年来一直停留在原来的水平上，现在也有了改进。广大革命职工满怀胜利的信心说：我们要实现“毛主席给我们撑腰，我们给毛主席争气”的誓言，深入持久地开展革命大批判，把“抓革命，促生产”的伟大群众运动，轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实地开展下去，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋斗！
