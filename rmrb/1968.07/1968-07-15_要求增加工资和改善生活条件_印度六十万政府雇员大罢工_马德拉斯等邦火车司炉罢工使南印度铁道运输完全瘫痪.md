New Delhi, July 14 (New China News Agency) — Government employees in the Indian states of Madhya Pradesh and Bihar, numbering 600,000, have gone on strike, plunging these two states into chaos.

The 400,000 government employees in Madhya Pradesh began their strike on July 8. On July 11, 200,000 government employees in Bihar joined the strike. They are demanding wage increases and improved living conditions.

In India, government employees include not only lower-level officials in government agencies but also a large number of workers in courts, hospitals, and other institutions, such as cleaners, janitors, and nurses. They often face oppression, humiliation, and discrimination from reactionary bureaucrats. Their working hours are long, and their working conditions are poor. Their wages are the lowest in government agencies. In the face of rising prices, they find it difficult to make ends meet.

Over the past few years, Indian government employees have repeatedly launched large-scale strikes across states and the nation to oppose the tyranny of the Indian reactionary government and fight for their right to survive. At the end of 1966, government employees in nine states and approximately 20 cities went on strike. In Uttar Pradesh alone, 500,000 people participated, raising the slogan "Overthrow the reactionary government of the Indian National Congress."

At the same time, 4,000 locomotive drivers in four southern Indian states (Madras, Kerala, Andhra, and Mysore) went on strike starting on July 6, demanding shorter working hours and wage increases. The reactionary Indian government's railway management bureau issued an ultimatum on July 11, demanding that the striking workers return to work by midnight that day, or face "severe disciplinary action." However, the threats did not deter the striking workers, who continued their struggle, causing the railways in southern India to come to a complete standstill.

    要求增加工资和改善生活条件
    印度六十万政府雇员大罢工
    马德拉斯等邦火车司炉罢工使南印度铁道运输完全瘫痪
    新华社十四日讯　新德里消息：印度中央邦和比哈尔邦六十万政府雇员举行大罢工，使这两个邦陷入混乱状态之中。
    中央邦四十万政府雇员从七月八日开始罢工。比哈尔邦二十万政府雇员十一日参加了罢工。他们要求增加工资和改善生活条件。
    印度的政府雇员除了包括政府机关中的下级职员外，还包括法院、医院和其它机构中的广大劳动者，如清洁工人、勤杂工人、护士等。他们经常受到反动官僚们的压迫、污辱和歧视。他们的工作时间很长，工作条件恶劣。他们的工资在政府机关里是最低的。在物价不断上涨的情况下，他们很难维持生活。
    在过去几年间，印度政府雇员曾经一再发动全邦和全国规模的大罢工，反对印度反动政府的暴政，争取生存的权利。在一九六六年年底，曾经有九个邦大约二十个城市的政府雇员参加了罢工，仅北方邦就有五十万人参加，提出了“推翻国大党反动政府”的口号。
    与此同时，南印度四个邦（马德拉斯、喀拉拉、安得拉、迈索尔）的四千名火车司炉，从六日起举行罢工，要求缩短劳动时间和增加工资。印度反动政府的铁道管理局十一日横蛮地向罢工工人下了一道所谓“最后通牒”，要他们当天半夜复工，否则采取所谓
  “严厉的纪律行动”。但是威胁吓不倒罢工工人，他们在坚持斗争，使南印度的铁道运输完全陷入瘫痪。
