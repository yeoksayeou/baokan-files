Under the ruthless exploitation and plundering of U.S. imperialism, the economic difficulties of Latin American countries are further deepening.

According to recent official reports from the "Organization of American States" and materials provided by the "Economic Commission for Latin America," in 1967, most Latin American countries were deeply mired in a situation of production stagnation, falling export commodity prices, surging foreign debt, worsening fiscal difficulties, currency devaluation, and widespread suffering among the people.

Last year, the economies of Latin American countries, like the previous year, remained stagnant. Only a few countries, such as Mexico and Venezuela, barely managed to meet or slightly exceed the target set by the "Alliance for Progress," controlled by the United States, of a 2.5% increase in per capita gross national product. The economies of most other countries not only failed to develop but also continued to decline. For example, Uruguay's industrial production fell by 4%. In Argentina, which accounts for a significant portion of Latin America's industrial development, production increased by only 0.4%. Brazil's industry was also sluggish. This resulted in Latin American countries' per capita gross national product increasing by only 1.6% last year.

The general trend of economic stagnation in Latin American countries is closely linked to these countries' long-term plundering by imperialism, their semi-feudal and semi-colonial social nature, and their trade system, which relies on exporting one or a few products to North America and Western Europe to earn foreign exchange. Because of this, the countries in this region are particularly vulnerable to the disasters of price reductions for imported raw materials and unequal exchange to shift crises, as imposed by the United States and other imperialist countries.

As early as 1966, the export products of Latin American countries began to experience "oversupply" and price drops due to the economic downturn in the United States and Western European countries. In 1967, this trend continued. Coffee, which accounts for a quarter of Latin America's total exports, has reached a very serious level of "oversupply." Brazil alone has enough stock to meet the international market's demand for a year and three months. This has led to a significant drop in coffee prices, causing great difficulties for major coffee-exporting countries like Brazil and Colombia. Argentina and Uruguay are major exporters of agricultural and livestock products and meat. Last year, due to the sharp drop in meat prices on the international market and the reduction in domestic production caused by floods in these two countries, their export earnings also decreased significantly. Copper accounts for 61% of Chile's exports. The price of copper dropped from 70 cents per pound in the previous year to 46 cents per pound last year, causing Chile's international trade income to plummet. Other exported products such as tin, lead, and zinc also experienced price drops, leading to a continuous decrease in Latin American countries' international trade income. In 1966, Latin American countries had a trade surplus of $112 million, a decrease of $25 million from 1965. In 1967, the surplus again decreased by $300 million compared to 1966.

The decrease in export earnings caused by the drop in commodity prices has significantly exacerbated the economic and fiscal difficulties of Latin American countries, reducing their foreign exchange reserves and import capacity. However, the disasters do not end there. In recent years, due to the annual loans and investments made by imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, a large amount of profit has been extracted from Latin America. This has resulted in the international balance of payments of Latin American countries being in deficit, even in cases of trade surpluses, forcing many countries to rely on foreign loans to get by. Comparing 1960 and 1966, the foreign debt of Latin American countries increased from $6.1 billion to $12 billion, and the annual interest payments increased from $280 million to $570 million. In 1966 alone, the profits remitted by foreign-funded companies reached $1.6 billion, far exceeding the trade surplus of $112 million for that year.

The burden of paying foreign capital profits and debt interest in Latin American countries is even greater than the new inflow of foreign investment and loans. For example, in 1965, the profits and interest extracted by foreigners from Latin America were $950 million more than the funds and loans they invested in Latin America that year.

Under these circumstances, many countries in Latin America are increasingly shackled by the heavy chains of imperialist debt. Last year, Chile had a trade surplus, but due to the burden of $2.3 billion in foreign debt, it still had a deficit in its international balance of payments. Foreign exchange reserves decreased by $70 million in the first eight months. Brazil, which bears $3.5 billion in foreign debt, had a trade deficit of $100 million, but its international balance of payments deficit reached $300 million, leading to a severe depletion of foreign exchange reserves. At the beginning of this year, it had to borrow an additional $610 million from abroad to tide over the difficulties.

The worsening economic difficulties in Latin American countries have provided imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, with convenient conditions to further enslave them. For example, the so-called "Alliance for Progress" plan used by the United States to control and enslave Latin American countries imposes harsh loan conditions and interferes with the economic policies of these countries: one moment it demands that the governments of these countries implement austerity measures such as wage freezes, and the next moment it demands excessive investment in housing, schools, roads, and other areas, leading to severe inflation. As a result, the economies of many Latin American countries have been subjected to continuous and violent shocks of inflation and deflation, causing harmful fluctuations in the national economy.

In fact, due to the enslavement, plundering, and interference of U.S. imperialism, price increases, currency devaluation, and rising unemployment have become common disasters in Latin American countries last year. For example, Argentina's living expenses increased by 30% last year, with 800,000 unemployed, accounting for 10% of the national workforce; the Argentine government was forced to devalue the peso by 40% in March last year. Brazil's fiscal deficit reached $300 million last year, leading to soaring prices, and at the beginning of this year, it had to devalue the new currency issued in February last year by an additional 18.5%. The Chilean government admitted that domestic living expenses soared by 26% last year. From January to March this year, the Chilean peso against the U.S. dollar continuously depreciated, with a total depreciation of 12%. Other countries such as Peru also devalued their currencies by 40%.

Currently, due to the deepening financial and economic crises in the capitalist world, all imperialist countries are shifting their crises, posing even more severe threats to the exports and economies of Latin American countries. Starting from March this year, export commodities such as non-ferrous metals, wool, wheat, coffee, and sugar in Latin American countries have all experienced price drops. The United States has formulated some "protective" laws affecting $1.2 billion of Latin American exports, and capitalist countries in Western Europe are also taking restrictive import measures, further exacerbating the difficulties faced by Latin American countries.

Due to the above-mentioned situations, class contradictions and national contradictions between the people of these countries and the United States are increasingly intensifying. Since this year, the struggles of workers, students, and other strata of people in many countries against U.S. imperialism and dictatorship, and for the right to live and political rights, have been on the rise. Currently, the revolutionary mass movements in various countries of Latin America are surging forward. This shows that the people of Latin American countries have reached a point where they can no longer tolerate the oppression, plundering, and enslavement of imperialism led by the United States.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Imperialism fears most the awakening of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It fears the awakening of the peoples of all countries in the world. We must unite and drive U.S. imperialism out of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and back to its own home." The peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America will definitely accomplish this great historical task by persevering in their struggles.

    在帝国主义肆意榨取下的拉美各国经济
    在美帝国主义敲骨吸髓的残酷剥削和掠夺下，拉丁美洲国家经济困难正在进一步大大加深。
    根据最近“美洲国家组织”发表的官方报告以及“拉丁美洲经济委员会”提供的材料，一九六七年大多数拉丁美洲国家都深深陷入了生产萎缩、出口商品价格下跌、外债激增、财政困难加剧、货币贬值、民不聊生的境地。
    去年，拉丁美洲各国同前年一样，经济上继续处于停滞状态。只有墨西哥、委内瑞拉等少数几个国家勉强达到或稍稍超过美国所控制的“争取进步联盟”规定的国民生产总值按人口平均增长百分之二点五的指标。其他多数国家的经济则不但没有发展，而且在进一步萎缩。例如，乌拉圭的工业生产下降了百分之四。在拉丁美洲工业发展中占很大比重的阿根廷，只增加了百分之零点四。巴西的工业也是一蹶不振。这就使拉丁美洲国家去年按人口平均计算的国民生产总值，只增加了百分之一点六。
    拉丁美洲国家经济的普遍趋向停滞，是同这些国家长期受帝国主义掠夺、保留着半封建半殖民地的社会性质、经济上只靠向北美、西欧出口一种或少数几种产品取得外汇的贸易制度分不开的。正是因为这样，这个地区的国家特别容易受到以美国为首的各个帝国主义国家压低进口原料价格，实行不等价交换以转嫁危机的灾难。
    拉丁美洲国家出口的产品，早在一九六六年就因受美国和西欧国家经济不景气的影响而出现生产“过剩”和价格下跌。一九六七年，这一趋势继续发展。占拉丁美洲出口总值四分之一的咖啡，生产“过剩”已达到十分严重的地步。单是巴西一国的存货，就足以满足国际市场上一年零三个月的需求量。这就造成咖啡的大幅度跌价，给巴西、哥伦比亚等主要咖啡出口国带来了重重困难。阿根廷和乌拉圭是主要出口农牧产品和肉类的国家，去年由于国际市场上肉价猛跌，再加上这两个国家国内的水灾造成的生产下降，出口收入也大大减少。铜占智利出口的百分之六十一，前年铜价为每磅七十美分，去年降到四十六美分，这使智利的国际贸易收入急剧减少。其他如锡、铅、锌等拉丁美洲国家出口的产品也相继跌价，造成了拉丁美洲国家国际贸易收入的不断减少。一九六六年拉丁美洲国家对外贸易出超十一亿二千万美元，比一九六五年减少二亿五千万美元，一九六七年又比一九六六年减少了三亿美元。
    商品价格下跌造成的出口收入的减少，大大加重了拉丁美洲国家的经济和财政困难，削减了它们的外汇储备和进口能力。但是，灾难并不到此为止。近年来，由于帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义每年通过放款和投资，从拉丁美洲榨取走大量利润，这使得拉丁美洲国家的国际收支，甚至在贸易出超的情况下仍然入不敷出，许多国家不得不靠借外债度日。以一九六○年和一九六六年相比，拉丁美洲各国政府的外债从六十一亿美元增加到一百二十亿美元，每年支付的利息从二亿八千万美元增加到五亿七千万美元。一九六六年单是外资开办的公司汇出的利润就达十六亿美元，远远超过了这一年拉丁美洲对外贸易的出超额十一亿二千万美元。
    拉丁美洲国家支付外资利润和外债本息的负担，甚而超过了新流入的外国投资和贷款。例如一九六五年，外国从拉丁美洲掠夺的利润和利息，就比它们在这一年中投进拉丁美洲的资金和贷款多九亿五千万美元。
    在这种情况下，拉丁美洲的许多国家都日甚一日地被套上帝国主义的债务的重重枷锁。去年智利对外贸易有出超，但因为担负着二十三亿美元的巨额外债，仍然出现国际收支的亏空。外汇储备在头八个月就减少了七千万美元。背负着三十五亿美元外债的巴西，由于贸易入超一亿美元，而国际收支赤字却达三亿美元，外汇储备严重枯竭，今年年初不得不再向外国借款六亿一千万美元来度难关。
    拉丁美洲国家经济困难的加重，给了帝国主义特别是美帝国主义进一步奴役它们的便利条件。例如，美国用以控制和奴役拉丁美洲国家的所谓“争取进步联盟”计划，就是用苛刻的贷款条件横加干涉这些国家的经济政策：一会儿要这些国家的政府实行勒紧裤带、冻结工资的紧缩政策，一会儿又要它们在修建住宅、学校、道路等方面进行过量的投资，造成严重的通货膨胀。结果是许多拉丁美洲国家的经济一直经受着通货膨胀和通货收缩的不断猛烈冲击，造成了对国民经济十分有害的不断波动。
    实际上，由于美帝国主义的奴役、掠夺和干涉，物价上涨、货币贬值、失业人数激增，已成为去年拉丁美洲国家的共同灾难。例如，阿根廷去年生活费上涨百分之三十，失业人数达八十万人，占全国劳动力的百分之十；阿根廷政府去年三月被迫把本国货币比索贬值百分之四十。巴西去年财政赤字达三亿美元，造成物价飞涨，今年年初不得不把去年二月发行的新币又贬值百分之十八点五。智利政府承认去年国内生活费猛烈上涨了百分之二十六。今年一到三月，智利币对美元牌价连续贬低，共贬值百分之十二。其他如秘鲁货币贬值百分之四十。
    目前，由于资本主义世界的金融危机和经济危机进一步深化，各个帝国主义都在转嫁危机，拉丁美洲国家的出口和经济受到更加严重的威胁。从今年三月起，拉丁美洲国家的出口原料：有色金属、羊毛、小麦、咖啡、糖果等都纷纷跌价。美国又制订影响到拉丁美洲十二亿美元出口的一些“保护性”法案，西欧的资本主义国家也都在采取限制进口的保护措施，这就使拉丁美洲国家面临更大的困难。
    由于上述这些情况，拉丁美洲各国的阶级矛盾和这些国家人民同美帝的民族矛盾不断激化。今年以来，许多国家的工人、学生和其他阶层人民反美反独裁，争取生存权利和政治权利的斗争日益高涨。目前，拉丁美洲各国的革命群众运动正在汹涌澎湃地发展。这说明拉丁美洲各国人民对于以美国为首的帝国主义的压迫掠夺和奴役，已经到了不能再忍受的地步了。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“帝国主义最怕的是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民觉悟，怕世界各国人民的觉悟。我们要团结起来把美帝国主义从亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲赶回它的老家去。”亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民坚持斗争，一定会实现这个伟大的历史任务。
