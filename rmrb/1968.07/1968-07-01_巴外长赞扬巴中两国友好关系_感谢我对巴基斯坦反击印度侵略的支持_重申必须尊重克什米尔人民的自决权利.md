Pakistani Foreign Minister Ashad Hussain delivered a speech on foreign policy in the National Assembly in Rawalpindi on the 28th. He said: "Pakistan and China have always maintained a very friendly and sincere neighborly relationship. Our relationship continues to expand and is firmly based on mutual trust, frankness, and sincerity."

He said: "China has consistently and resolutely supported Pakistan's just stance in advocating for the self-determination of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. We also thank China for guaranteeing assistance to Pakistan in the event of aggression. Of course, the Pakistani people will forever remember with gratitude China's strong support for Pakistan during the Indian attack in September 1965 and the valuable assistance provided afterwards."

He said: "Ensuring close friendly relations with the People's Republic of China will be my responsibility."

When discussing Pakistan's relations with India, he said that the fundamental dispute between India and Pakistan is related to how to finally resolve the issue of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. India, having obtained military aid from abroad, has armed itself to the teeth as a prelude to negotiating with Pakistan from a position of strength, aiming to make Pakistan accept the ceasefire line as an international border. This is something that Pakistan will never agree to.

The foreign minister strongly refuted the claim that Pakistan has put the Kashmir dispute with India on the back burner. He said that the Kashmir issue burns like a torch in the hearts of the Pakistani people and cannot be cooled down. The Kashmir issue will ultimately be resolved by the Kashmiri people themselves, who are currently deprived of their right to self-determination. The 1965 Indo-Pakistani War fully proved that India cannot impose its will on Pakistan.

    巴外长赞扬巴中两国友好关系
    感谢我对巴基斯坦反击印度侵略的支持
    重申必须尊重克什米尔人民的自决权利
  新华社拉瓦尔品第三十日电　巴基斯坦外交部长阿沙德·侯赛因二十八日在这里的国民议会上发表外交政策演说时说：“巴基斯坦和中国一直保持着十分友好的诚恳的睦邻关系。……我们的关系继续扩大，仍然牢牢地建立在互相信任、坦率和真诚的基础上。”
    他说：“中国始终不渝地、坚决地支持巴基斯坦争取查谟和克什米尔人民自决权利的正义立场。我们还感谢中国保证在巴基斯坦遭到侵略时提供帮助。当然，巴基斯坦人民将永远怀着感激的心情，牢记中国在一九六五年九月印度进攻时给予巴基斯坦的大力支持以及后来向我们提供的宝贵帮助。”
    他说：“确保同中华人民共和国的亲密友好关系，将是我的职责。”
    在谈到巴基斯坦同印度的关系时，他说，印巴之间的根本纠纷是同如何最后解决查谟和克什米尔邦有关。印度从外国取得军事援助，把自己武装到牙齿，作为从实力地位出发同巴基斯坦谈判的前奏，以使巴基斯坦接受克什米尔停火线为国际界线。这是巴基斯坦无论如何都不会同意的。
    这位外长严词驳斥了所谓巴基斯坦已把同印度的克什米尔争端放进冷藏库的说法。他说，克什米尔这个问题在巴基斯坦人民的心里象火炬一样燃烧着，决不可能冷却。克什米尔问题最后将由克什米尔人民自己来解决，他们现在被剥夺了自决权利。一九六五年的印巴战争充分证明，印度决不可能把自己的意志强加给巴基斯坦。
