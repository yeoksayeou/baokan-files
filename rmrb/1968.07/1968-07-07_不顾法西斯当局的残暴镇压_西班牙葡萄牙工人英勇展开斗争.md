In the fascist-ruled Spain and Portugal, workers, despite the reactionary authorities' brutal suppression, have persisted in their struggle against the ruthless exploitation by monopolistic capitalist groups.

The strike by dock workers at Barcelona, Spain's largest port, has entered its fourth day. The workers are demanding improved working conditions, but the port management not only refused their just demands but also illegally dismissed 1,000 striking workers. This outrageous act has further enraged the workers.

The strike by the dock workers has completely paralyzed the port of Barcelona, with 65 ships stranded and unable to move.

In Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, workers at the electric tram company went on strike for three days from July 1 to July 3, demanding a wage increase. On July 4, while the tram company management partially agreed to the workers' demand for a wage increase, the reactionary authorities sent in large contingents of armed police to surround the depot, attempting to force the workers back to work. The striking workers, undeterred by the violence, fought back against the police. Some workers bravely lay down in the depot to prevent the trams from leaving, expressing their strong protest against the reactionary authorities.

    不顾法西斯当局的残暴镇压
    西班牙葡萄牙工人英勇展开斗争
    新华社五日讯　在法西斯统治下的西班牙和葡萄牙的工人，不顾反动当局的残暴镇压，坚持进行反对垄断资本集团残酷剥削的斗争。
    西班牙最大港口巴萨罗纳码头工人的罢工，四日已经进入第四天。码头工人要求改善工作条件，但是码头管理当局不仅拒绝工人的正义要求，并且把一千名罢工工人非法开除。这一罪恶行径激起了工人的更大的愤怒。
    码头工人的罢工使巴萨罗纳港完全瘫痪，六十五艘船只被困在港内不能动弹。
    葡萄牙首都里斯本的电车公司的工人从一日至三日罢工三天，要求增加工资。四日，在电车公司当局被迫部分同意工人增加工资的要求的同时，反动当局派来大队武装警察，包围停车场，企图强迫工人复工。罢工工人不畏强暴，同警察进行了斗争。有的工人勇敢地躺在停车场内，阻止电车开出，以表示对反动当局的强烈抗议。
