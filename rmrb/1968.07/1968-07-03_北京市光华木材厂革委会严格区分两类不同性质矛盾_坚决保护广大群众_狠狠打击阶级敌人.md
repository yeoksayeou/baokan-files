The Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Light Wood Factory, in the process of firmly grasping class struggle and smashing the rightist reversal wind, strictly distinguishes between two types of contradictions. It resolutely protects the broad masses and severely strikes down the class enemies.

The factory established its Revolutionary Committee in June last year. A small handful of class enemies, unwilling to accept their defeat, attempted to make a comeback. This spring, they stirred up a new wave, dreaming of rehabilitating the overthrown capitalist-roaders and reversing the verdict on the capitalist reactionary line, ultimately aiming to overthrow the newly established Revolutionary Committee. A few masses were deceived and made some wrong statements and took wrong actions. At the beginning of the counterattack against the rightist reversal wind, some revolutionary masses, out of indignation, advocated punishing all those who participated in the rightist reversal activities. The Revolutionary Committee promptly organized revolutionary workers to study Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling the two types of contradictions. Chairman Mao said: "The contradictions between the enemy and us and those among the people are two different types of contradictions, and the methods of resolving them are also different." "Our army has always had two principles: first, be ruthless towards the enemy, suppress it, and annihilate it; second, be united with our own people, with the people, with comrades, with superiors, and with subordinates." These teachings of Chairman Mao greatly enlightened us. We believe that the rightist reversal wind must be firmly resisted and thoroughly smashed. However, for those who participated in the rightist reversal activities, we must make a concrete analysis and treat them differently. For a small handful of class enemies, whether they are in the open or behind the scenes, we must severely strike them down and not be lenient; but for those who were deceived by the class enemies and made some wrong statements and took wrong actions, since it is a contradiction among the people, we should adopt the principle of "punishing past mistakes and preventing future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient," and do a good job of winning them over and educating them, so as to better isolate and strike down a small handful of class enemies.

The Revolutionary Committee first fully mobilized the masses, based on exposing and investigating, to expose a small handful of class enemies who engaged in reversal activities, thoroughly criticized the counter-revolutionary crimes of these bad elements, and politically, ideologically, and theoretically criticized and denounced the rightist reversal wind.

The Revolutionary Committee, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching of "clearing up thoughts and uniting comrades," started from helping them understand the major issues in the struggle between the two lines, and conducted patient work to win them over and educate them. The Revolutionary Committee widely mobilized the masses to carry out the "one helps one, one pairs with one" activity, helping these comrades to raise their awareness. For those whose thoughts are not easily turned around, the members of the Revolutionary Committee personally went to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions with them, recalled bitterness and sweetness together, used Mao Zedong Thought to help them raise their consciousness, solve their ideological problems, and then through their personal experiences, won over and helped those who were deeply involved but had slower awakening. These deceived comrades, after education and help, recognized their mistakes, made self-criticisms, and immediately joined the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries in the factory to actively engage in the struggle against the enemy, exposing and criticizing the crimes of a small handful of class enemies, and thoroughly repelling the rightist reversal wind. A worker who stood on the wrong side during the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution made some mistakes again in the rightist reversal wind stirred up by the class enemies. The comrades of the Revolutionary Committee also pulled him with enthusiasm, studied Chairman Mao's works with him repeatedly, had heart-to-heart talks with him, and finally made him realize his mistakes, deeply reflected, and exposed the evil activities of the class enemies. The facts exposed by the deceived comrades made the cover of class struggle in the factory more thoroughly exposed, making the activities of the class enemies more clearly revealed, which was beneficial for the Revolutionary Committee to lead the revolutionary masses of the entire factory to more steadily, accurately, and severely strike down a small handful of class enemies.

In the struggle to smash the rightist reversal wind, the Revolutionary Committee organized the majority of cadres to participate in the criticism of the rightist reversal wind, raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. At the same time, it organized the cadres to participate in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, further clarifying the major issues in the struggle between the two lines politically and ideologically. The revolutionary criticism raised their awareness, and the evil activities of the class enemies heightened their revolutionary vigilance. Many cadres, after this struggle, had a significant increase in their political awareness. Some revolutionary cadres who still had some resistance to the mass movement corrected their attitudes and stood up for the revolution. Some units, due to the sabotage of class enemies, were unable to establish a three-in-one leadership for a long time, successfully implemented the revolutionary three-in-one combination, making the entire factory present a "sea of red" good situation. The revolutionary cadres who had already combined were more active in combining revolution with production. The old and new cadres, in this struggle, further deepened their mutual understanding, and their feelings became more harmonious and their relationships more intimate.

"Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." Through the struggle to smash the rightist reversal wind, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory further united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, the Revolutionary Committee was further consolidated and developed, and its prestige was further enhanced. The revolutionary and production situation of the entire factory is excellent. The total output value in April increased by 64% compared to March, in May it increased by 15% compared to April, and in June it increased by 37% compared to May.

    北京市光华木材厂革委会严格区分两类不同性质矛盾
    坚决保护广大群众　狠狠打击阶级敌人
    本报讯　北京市光华木材厂革命委员会，在狠抓阶级斗争，粉碎右倾翻案妖风的过程中，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，对于一部分受蒙蔽的群众进行深入的教育工作，团结了一切可以团结的革命力量，稳准狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    这个厂在去年六月成立革委会以后，一小撮阶级敌人不甘心于自己的失败，妄图卷土重来；今年春天，他们又刮起了一股妖风，梦想为被打倒的走资派翻案，为资产阶级反动路线翻案，进而搞垮新生的革命委员会。少数群众受了蒙蔽，说过一些错话，做过一些错事。在开始反击右倾翻案妖风的时候，有的革命群众出于义愤，主张对所有参加搞右倾翻案的人都要整一整。革委会及时组织革命职工学习了毛主席关于正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾的教导。毛主席说：“敌我之间和人民内部这两类矛盾的性质不同，解决的方法也不同。”“我们的军队一向就有两条方针：第一对敌人要狠，要压倒它，要消灭它；第二对自己人、对人民、对同志、对官长、对部下要和，要团结。”毛主席这些教导，使大家受到很大启示。大家认为，对右倾翻案妖风必须坚决反击，彻底粉碎。但是，对于参加右倾翻案活动的人，要作具体分析，区别对待。对一小撮阶级敌人，不管他是幕前的还是幕后的，都要狠狠打击，不能手软；而对于在右倾翻案活动中说过一些错话，做过一些错事的受蒙蔽的群众，由于是人民内部矛盾，那就应当采取“惩前毖后，治病救人”的原则，做好争取教育工作，以便更好地孤立和打击一小撮阶级敌人。
    革委会首先充分发动群众，在揭发检举和调查研究的基础上，把一小撮搞翻案活动的阶级敌人揭露出来，彻底批判了这些坏家伙的反革命罪行，从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒批臭了右倾翻案妖风。
    革委会对于受阶级敌人蒙蔽的少数群众，遵照毛主席关于“既要弄清思想又要团结同志”的教导，从帮助他们弄清两条路线斗争的大是大非出发，进行了耐心的争取教育工作。革委会广泛发动群众，开展了“一帮一，一对红”的活动，帮助这些同志提高认识。对个别思想不容易转过弯来的同志，革委会成员就亲自去同他们一起学习毛主席的最新指示，一起忆苦思甜，用毛泽东思想帮助他们提高觉悟，解决思想问题，再通过他们现身说法，去争取帮助那些陷得较深而觉悟又较慢的同志。这些受蒙蔽的同志经过教育和帮助，认识了自己的错误，作了自我批评，而且立即同全厂广大无产阶级革命派一起积极投入了对敌斗争，揭发批判了一小撮阶级敌人的罪行，彻底击退了右倾翻案风。有个工人在无产阶级文化大革命初期站错了队，这次在阶级敌人刮起的右倾翻案风中，又犯了一些错误。革委会同志也满腔热情地拉他一把，和他一起反复学习毛主席著作，同他谈心，终于使他认识了自己的错误，沉痛地做了检查，并揭露了阶级敌人的罪恶活动。受蒙蔽的同志揭发的大量事实，使得厂内阶级斗争的盖子揭得更加彻底，使得阶级敌人的活动暴露得更加清楚，这就有利于革委会带领全厂革命群众更加稳准狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。
    在粉碎右倾翻案妖风的斗争中，革委会组织广大干部参加了对右倾翻案妖风的批判，使他们提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。同时，组织干部们参加毛泽东思想学习班，进一步从政治上、思想上弄清两条路线斗争的大是大非。革命的大批判使他们提高了认识，阶级敌人的罪恶活动使他们提高了革命警惕。不少干部经过这场斗争，政治觉悟有了很大的提高。一部分对群众运动还有某些抵触情绪的革命干部，进一步端正了态度，纷纷站出来革命。一些由于阶级敌人的破坏、长时间不能建立三结合领导班子的单位，顺利地实现了革命的三结合，使全厂出现了“一片红”的大好形势。原来已经结合的革命干部，抓革命促生产更加积极。新老干部在这场斗争中，也进一步加深了相互了解，感情更加融洽，关系更加亲密。
      “阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”通过粉碎右倾翻案妖风的斗争，全厂革命职工在毛泽东思想基础上进一步团结起来，革委会得到进一步巩固和发展，威信更加提高。全厂革命和生产形势一片大好。四月份总产值比三月份增长了百分之六十四，五月份比四月份提高了百分之十五，六月份又比五月份提高了百分之三十七。
