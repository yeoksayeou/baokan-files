The U.S. imperialists' faithful running dog, the Thanom-Praphas regime in Thailand, has defied the strong opposition and condemnation of the Thai people and people all over the world, and brazenly sent another 5,000 troops to South Vietnam to serve as cannon fodder for the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression in Vietnam.

According to reports from Western news agencies, the first batch of 1,500 of these mercenary troops has already been shipped to Saigon on July 22. The rest of the cannon fodder will be sent to South Vietnam in batches starting in early August.
