The counter-revolutionary collusion between U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist renegade clique is becoming increasingly blatant.

On June 27, the Soviet revisionist clique's Foreign Minister Gromyko delivered a speech, frenziedly attacking China and vigorously advocating for the U.S. and the Soviet Union to "seek common interests together" and "cooperate with each other in solving urgent international issues." He also announced that the Soviet revisionists are prepared to "exchange views" with U.S. imperialism on the issue of "limiting and reducing" offensive and defensive strategic nuclear weapon systems. This is another act of surrender by the Soviet ruling clique to U.S. imperialism, and another major betrayal of the Soviet people and the people of the world.

The slave fawns over the master, and the master immediately praises him. The U.S. State Department had not even seen the full text of Gromyko's speech when it announced that it would "contact" the Soviet revisionist clique to "arrange the date and location of the talks." On July 1, Johnson was overjoyed, saying that the U.S. and the Soviet Union had "agreed to discuss" Gromyko's "proposal" in the near future. The coordination between Moscow and Washington is so tight, indicating that the two sides have long been conspiring together.

Since the Johnson-Kosygin-Glassboro talks a year ago, the Soviet revisionist clique has engaged in a series of treacherous and collusive acts on issues such as Vietnam, the Middle East, and nuclear weapons.

The deals between the U.S. and the Soviet Union are becoming more frequent and larger in scale. In just ten days in June, the U.S. and the Soviet Union completed four black deals on issues such as the "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" and providing "nuclear protection." Now, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have announced an agreement to discuss the so-called "limitation and reduction" of strategic nuclear weapon systems, marking their even more shameless and barefaced counter-revolutionary collusion.

The so-called "limitation and reduction" of strategic nuclear weapon systems by the U.S. and the Soviet Union is a complete fraud. For a long time, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have stockpiled a large number of strategic nuclear weapons and established nuclear missile systems. This new deal between the U.S. and the Soviet Union does not in the slightest hinder their policy of nuclear threats and nuclear blackmail.

Currently, U.S. imperialism is suffering a severe defeat in the Vietnam War, and its political and financial crises are unprecedentedly serious. Whether at home or abroad, it is in a very difficult situation, with its hands full. In this context, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique proposes that the U.S. and the Soviet Union engage in transactions on the issue of strategic nuclear weapon systems, obviously helping its master out of a tight spot. Its purpose is to allow U.S. imperialism to free up forces to intensify the Vietnam War, further suppress the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and further promote its already bankrupt counter-revolutionary global strategy.

On the issue of nuclear weapons, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have long stood together, opposing China and the revolutionary peoples of the world, and are genuine "nuclear colonialists." The Soviet revisionist clique's fake anti-imperialist cover has been increasingly torn apart with the development of international class struggle, leaving almost nothing. Now, the Soviet revisionist clique openly announces that it will reach an agreement with U.S. imperialism on the issue of adjusting their strategic nuclear weapon systems, which further blatantly reveals to the world that the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialists have further formed a nuclear military alliance.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Soviet revisionist renegade clique is the slave and henchman who kneels before imperialism." In the current world situation, which is increasingly unfavorable to U.S. imperialism and favorable to the revolutionary peoples of the world, the Kosygin-Brezhnev gang of traitors will inevitably work even harder to serve their master. The rapid escalation of the counter-revolutionary collusion between U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism reflects the severity of the blows dealt to U.S. imperialism by the world revolutionary storm, as well as the desperate situation of the Soviet revisionist clique.

The Soviet revisionist clique's acceleration of its betrayal will only further educate the people of the world and the Soviet people from the opposite side, promoting the great struggle of the revolutionary peoples of various countries against imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique, and the reactionaries of various countries. The great storm of world revolution will ultimately sweep away this gang of scoundrels.

    美苏反革命勾结的又一大暴露
    本报评论员
    美帝国主义和苏修叛徒集团之间的反革命大勾结，越来越露骨。
    六月二十七日，苏修集团外交部长葛罗米柯发表演说，疯狂地攻击中国，大肆鼓吹苏美两国“一起寻找共同的利益”，“在解决迫切的国际问题方面互相配合”。他并且宣布苏修准备同美帝国主义就“限制和削减”进攻性和防御性战略核武器系统问题“交换意见”。这是苏修统治集团对美帝国主义的又一次投降，是对苏联人民和全世界人民的又一次大叛卖。
    奴才大献殷勤，主子立即夸奖。美国国务院还没有看到葛罗米柯讲话全文，就宣布要同苏修集团“接触”，“商订会谈日期和地点”。七月一日，约翰逊喜形于色地说，美苏已“同意在最近的将来”讨论葛罗米柯提出的“建议”。莫斯科和华盛顿之间配合得这样紧密，说明美苏两家是早就密谋好了的。
    约翰逊、柯西金葛拉斯堡罗会谈后的一年来，苏修集团在越南问题、中东问题、核武器问题等一系列问题上，进行了接二连三的叛卖勾当。
    美苏两家的交易，越做越多，越做越大。仅在六月份的十天内，美苏就在“防止核扩散条约”，提供“核保护”等问题上，做成了四笔黑交易。现在，美苏又宣布就讨论所谓“限制和削减”战略核武器系统的问题达成协议，这标志着它们更加无耻、更加赤裸裸地进行反革命勾结。
    美苏双方所谓“限制和削减”战略核武器系统是个彻头彻尾的骗局。长期以来，美苏已经储存了大量的战略核武器，建立了核导弹体系。美苏的这一笔新交易，丝毫无碍于它们推行核威胁、核讹诈的政策。
    当前，美帝国主义在侵越战争中遭到惨败，政治危机和财政金融危机空前严重，无论在国内和国外，都搞得焦头烂额，处境十分困难。苏修统治集团在这种情况下，提出苏美双方在战略核武器系统问题上进行交易，显然是帮了它的主子一个大忙，其目的是要让美帝国主义能够腾出力量来，强化侵越战争，加紧镇压亚非拉民族解放运动，进一步推行已经破产了的反革命全球战略。
    在核武器问题上，美苏早就站在一起，共同反对中国，反对世界革命人民，是地地道道的“核殖民主义”。苏修集团那块假反帝的遮羞布，随着国际阶级斗争的发展，已经剪得越来越小，所剩无几了。现在，苏修集团公然宣布要同美帝国主义就双方调整战略核武器系统的问题达成协议，这就更赤裸裸地向全世界表明，苏修美帝之间已经进一步结成了核军事同盟。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席指出：苏修叛徒集团“是跪倒在帝国主义面前的奴仆和爪牙”。在目前世界形势越来越不利于美帝国主义，而有利于世界革命人民的情况下，柯西金—勃列日涅夫这一伙叛徒必然要更加卖力气地为它的主子效劳。美帝苏修反革命勾结的迅速升级，反映了世界革命风暴对美帝国主义打击的严重性，也反映了苏修集团的穷途末路。
    苏修集团加速它们叛卖的步伐，只能进一步从反面教育全世界人民和苏联人民，促进各国革命人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏修集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派的伟大斗争。世界革命的伟大风暴，终归必将把这一伙害人虫扫除干净。
