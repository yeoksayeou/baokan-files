The Revolutionary Committee of the Hegang Red Flag Coal Mine, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel, has established a system of regular rotation of committee members' work points. This ensures that the members do not leave their production duties while fully playing their leadership roles. This practice has also strengthened the committee's connection with the masses.

After the establishment of the Red Flag Coal Mine Revolutionary Committee, the more than ten revolutionary representatives who joined the committee returned to their respective units to promote revolution and production. Due to the dispersed nature of the mining areas, which are far apart, the committee members, upon returning to their units, lacked a comprehensive understanding of the revolution and production across the entire mine. This hindered their ability to participate in the leadership of the entire mine and affected the close relationship between the committee and the masses.

The mine's Revolutionary Committee and the PLA's leftist support personnel promptly identified this issue and gave it serious attention. They jointly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings: "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to connect with the masses." They severely criticized the revisionist line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the mine, further recognizing the importance of continuing and developing the close connection with the masses that Chairman Mao personally cultivated. This is crucial for consolidating and developing the victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, strengthening and developing the new revolutionary committees, and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Several months of experience in holding and exercising power have made them deeply realize that an important aspect of maintaining and developing the Party's tradition of close connection with the masses is to fully utilize the superior conditions of the revolutionary three-in-one combination, ensuring that the revolutionary committee members do not leave their production duties and remain rooted among the masses, while fully playing their leadership roles.

The Revolutionary Committee then convened a full committee meeting, discussing the topic: "How can the Revolutionary Committee members not leave their production duties and fully play their leadership roles?" After extensive and heated discussions, they decided to divide the committee members and standing committee members into four groups. In addition to continuing to promote revolution and production in their respective units, the members would rotate monthly to different units for work points, especially to areas with more problems and complex class struggles, to receive training and solve problems. They called this system the "Regular Rotation of Committee Members' Work Points."

When the committee members arrive at a new unit, they appear as ordinary workers, immersing themselves among the masses, bringing down Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and implementing them among the masses.

In one mining area of this mine, class struggles were extremely sharp and complex. Some bad elements used two-faced revolutionary tactics to seize part of the leadership. Revolutionary representative and committee member Fan Jingchang, upon arriving at the first mining area for work points, went deep into the working face, studying, working, and discussing national affairs with the workers. They held extensive activities to expose enemy situations, recall bitterness and think of sweetness, and study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle. This greatly raised the workers' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. The entire mining area, through extensive mobilization of the masses to launch a fierce attack on the class enemies, reclaimed the part of the leadership seized by the class enemies and exposed the hidden class enemies. The revolution and production saw tremendous changes.

Through practice, they found that the "Regular Rotation of Committee Members' Work Points" has the following advantages: First, it broadens the connection with the masses, placing the committee members under the supervision of all revolutionary workers in the mine, fundamentally changing the situation where committee members could only connect with the masses in their own units and only accept supervision from revolutionary workers in their own units. This greatly promotes the thought revolutionization of the committee members; second, because the committee members rotate to different units for work points, they have investigations and practices on the work of the entire mine, thus having the right to speak and fully playing their leadership roles; third, the committee members, in the great waves of class struggle, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to solve various new problems encountered in class struggle, raising their awareness of class struggle and line struggle as well as their policy level. They temper their loyalty to Chairman Mao, which is beneficial for cultivating and training successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause; fourth, it places the Revolutionary Committee under the broader supervision of the revolutionary masses, further developing the Party's tradition of close connection with the masses, and strengthening and consolidating the Revolutionary Committee.

    鹤岗红旗煤矿革委会委员定期调换蹲点效果良好
    既不脱离生产  又能发挥领导作用
    据新华社哈尔滨十二日电　黑龙江省鹤岗红旗煤矿革命委员会，在人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，建立了委员定期调换蹲点制度，做到委员既不脱产，又能充分发挥领导作用。他们这样做，也加强了革委会同群众的联系。
    红旗煤矿革命委员会成立以后，参加革委会的十几名革命群众代表，都回到本单位抓革命、促生产。由于采区分散，相距很远，委员们回本单位后，对全矿的革命、生产缺乏了解，不能很好地参与对全矿的领导，也影响了革委会同群众的密切联系。
    矿革命委员会和解放军支左人员及时地发现了这个问题，引起了极大的重视。他们共同学习了毛主席的伟大教导：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本矿代理人推行的修正主义路线，进一步认识到继续发扬毛主席亲自培育的我党密切联系群众的作风，对于巩固和发展无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，巩固和发展新生的革命委员会，加强无产阶级专政，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，具有非常重大的意义。几个月掌权、用权的实践，使他们深刻地体会到，继续保持和发扬党的密切联系群众的作风，很重要的一环在于充分发挥革命三结合本身具有的联系群众的优越条件，做到革委会委员既不脱产，永远扎根于群众之中，又能充分发挥其领导作用。
    于是，革命委员会召开了全体委员会议，以“革命委员会委员怎样才能既不脱产，又能充分发挥领导作用”为题，进行了广泛的热烈的讨论。通过反复酝酿和研究，他们把委员和常委分成四个组，委员除在本单位坚持抓革命、促生产外，每月定期轮流到各单位去蹲点，特别是到问题多、阶级斗争复杂的采区、班组去经受锻炼，解决问题。他们把这种制度叫做“委员定期调换蹲点制”。委员们每到一处，都以普通劳动者的身份出现，深入于群众之中，把毛主席的最新指示带下来，落实到群众中去。
    这个矿一采区阶级斗争极其尖锐复杂。有坏人用反革命两面派手法，篡夺了部分领导权。革命群众代表、矿革命委员会委员范景昌等到一采区蹲点时，深入到场子面去，跟工人一同学习，一同劳动，一同斗私批修，一同商讨国家大事，大摆敌情，大搞忆苦思甜活动，大学毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，大大提高了工人的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。全采区经过广泛发动群众向阶级敌人猛烈进攻，把阶级敌人窃踞的部分领导权夺了回来，把暗藏的阶级敌人挖了出来，革命和生产发生了巨大变化。
    通过实践，他们体会到“委员定期调换蹲点制”有以下几点好处：第一，更广泛地联系了群众，把委员置于全矿革命职工的监督之下，从根本上改变了委员只能联系本单位群众，只能接受本单位革命职工监督的状况，大大地促进了委员们的思想革命化；第二，由于委员们定期到各单位蹲点，对全矿的工作有调查，有实践，因而就有了发言权，充分地发挥了委员的领导作用；第三，委员们在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想解决阶级斗争中遇到的各种新问题，提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟以及政策水平，锻炼了对毛主席的一颗忠心，有利于培养和造就无产阶级革命事业的接班人；第四，更广泛地把革命委员会置于革命群众的监督之下，进一步发扬了党的密切联系群众的作风，加强和巩固了革委会。
