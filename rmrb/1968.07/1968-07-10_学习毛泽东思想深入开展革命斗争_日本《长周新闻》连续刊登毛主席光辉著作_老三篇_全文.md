Tokyo, July 8 (Xinhua) — To meet the needs of the Japanese revolutionary masses in studying Chairman Mao's works, the progressive newspaper *Chokyo Shimbun* published the full texts of Chairman Mao's brilliant works "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "On Practice" in three consecutive issues on June 30, July 3, and July 7.

The editorial board of *Chokyo Shimbun* stated in its editorial note that the three brilliant works "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "On Practice" are permeated with the proletarian worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people of one's own country and the people of the world. To correctly understand the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the Chinese people and to correctly wage the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people, it is absolutely necessary to deeply study the "Three Articles."

Since the autumn of 1966, after the revolutionary leftists of Yamaguchi Prefecture launched a massive attack on the revisionist clique of the Japanese Communist Party led by Kyuichi Tokuda, they have taken Chairman Mao's works, including the "Three Articles," as the foundation for their ideological construction. Recently, in summarizing the achievements of more than a year of studying the "Three Articles," they pointed out that the study of the "Three Articles" is the driving force for promoting ideological revolutionization.

The revolutionary leftists of Yamaguchi Prefecture are now striving to promote the study of the "Three Articles" among the workers and peasants.

    学习毛泽东思想深入开展革命斗争
    日本《长周新闻》连续刊登毛主席光辉著作“老三篇”全文
    新华社八日讯　东京消息：为了适应日本革命群众学习毛主席著作的需要，日本进步报纸《长周新闻》在六月三十日、七月三日和七日连续三期登载了毛主席的光辉著作《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》的全文。
    《长周新闻》编辑部在按语中说，《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》这三篇光辉著作贯穿着全心全意为本国人民和世界人民服务的无产阶级世界观。为了正确地理解中国人民的无产阶级文化大革命，为了正确地开展日本人民的革命斗争，深入地学习“老三篇”是绝对必要的。
    山口县革命左派自一九六六年秋大造日共宫本修正主义集团的反以后，就以大学“老三篇”等毛主席著作，作为思想建设的基础。最近他们在总结一年多学习“老三篇”运动的收获时指出，“老三篇”的学习是推动思想革命化的动力。
    山口县革命左派现在正努力把“老三篇”的学习推广到工农群众中去。
