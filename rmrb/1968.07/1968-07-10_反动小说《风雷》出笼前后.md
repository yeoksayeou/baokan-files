Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "Using novels to engage in anti-party activities is a great invention. To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." The reactionary novel "Thunderstorm" is precisely something concocted under the personal instructions of the Chinese Khrushchev, by his agents in Anhui such as Li Baohua. The publication of "Thunderstorm" once again exposed the heinous crimes of the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev, who used novels to create public opinion for their plot to usurp the party and restore capitalism.

The creation of "Thunderstorm" began in 1962. At that time, the class struggle at home and abroad was extremely intense. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries from various countries colluded to stage an anti-China farce. The Chinese Khrushchev also openly jumped out, colluding with domestic and foreign class enemies to create counter-revolutionary public opinion and carry out the restoration of capitalism. At the enlarged Central Work Conference, he openly rehabilitated the right-opportunist element Peng Dehuai, raving madly that "dissenting from the Three Red Banners, even proposing one's own line and program, is allowed." At the large Anhui meeting, he told Li Baohua and others: "Go back and write a book about the history of the past three years. If you are brave, turn it into a play, and if you are even braver, erect a monument to pass it on to future generations." He was afraid his henchmen would not dare to write, so he incited them further: "If you are attacked, you can resign, and when the line is correct later, you can come back to be the secretary." What is the "correct line" in the mind of the Chinese Khrushchev? This is the day he dreams of when the restoration of capitalism is successful. How audacious!

Who was entrusted with this black mission by the Chinese Khrushchev? Li Baohua chose the long-term revolutionary traitor Chen Dengke, who had donned the cloak of a "worker-peasant writer."

Chen Dengke, this counter-revolutionary who rose to prominence by aligning himself with the reactionary literary black line led by Zhou Yang, claimed that after the anti-rightist struggle, he "kept his head down for a few years." Upon hearing the black orders from the Chinese Khrushchev, he immediately became ecstatic and revealed his treacherous intentions. He enthusiastically praised: "Apart from him (referring to the Chinese Khrushchev), who dares to speak like this!" and raved madly: "Great! Now I am free! Liberated!" This counter-revolutionary, in half a year, rushed out a 450,000-word poisonous weed.

This poisonous weed was titled "In Search of My Father," which was the draft of "Thunderstorm."

The three words "In Search of My Father" contain an extremely reactionary political proposition. Chen Dengke openly declared: Those who "grew up eating small millet cakes from the farmers of Huabei" and "occupied certain leadership positions" have "forgotten the parents who sacrificed their lives to protect them," have "lost the truth," are "indifferent to the people," and have "done things that make friends sad and enemies happy." "Searching for the father" means "searching for the people, searching for the truth of the party."

This set of black jargon has a source. The Chinese Khrushchev had spread similar fallacies: "The traditions of the party have been destroyed," "the relationship between the party and the people has become distant" ... Enough! It is clear that Chen Dengke was following the "footsteps" of the Chinese Khrushchev and singing the same tune.

Chen Dengke, following Li Baohua's counter-revolutionary strategy of "not directly writing about the past three years," used the cover of "reflecting the cooperative movement" to actually write about the past three years; and under the guise of "transforming backward villages," he "put central issues into the grassroots level to write." Chen Dengke weaved a black line of "wrongful imprisonment" and "correcting wrongful imprisonment" in the novel, slandering the socialist countryside as "extremely difficult," the reason being "evil people in power" and "good people oppressed." It is clear that this is a poisonous weed that directly propagates the "spirit" of the Chinese Khrushchev's speech at the enlarged Central Work Conference.

"In Search of My Father" was completed in December 1962. At that time, the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, which had profound historical significance, had already been held, and Chairman Mao's great call to never forget class struggle had spread throughout the country. Chairman Mao's brilliant theory on class, class contradictions, and class struggle in socialist society had taken root in people's hearts. Soon, Chairman Mao gave instructions to launch the socialist education movement nationwide, to counterattack the bourgeoisie that was fiercely attacking us. Seeing the situation was not favorable, the Chinese Khrushchev began to play the counter-revolutionary two-faced trick, using the "red flag" to oppose the red flag. He took over the slogan of the socialist education movement, replaced the core, and threw out a line that was "left" in form but right in essence, opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, aiming to achieve the evil goal of fake "four cleanups" and true restoration.

To make Chen Dengke's reactionary novel suit the needs of the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary strategy, Li Baohua and his gang, along with the reactionary revisionist elements from the former Propaganda Department and the former Chinese Writers Association, all came up with schemes and jointly concocted this poisonous weed.

The first to jump out was the reactionary revisionist element from the former Chinese Writers Association, Shao Quanlin. Under the orders of the "Yama Hall" leaders Zhou Yang and Lin Mohan from the former Propaganda Department, he reviewed the draft twice and met with Chen Dengke three times. He affirmed that "the work can be published," but felt that writing about the "history of the past three years" was too blatant, so he designed a cover for Chen Dengke, telling him to add more chapters about "agricultural cooperation," to deceive the broad readers. Shao Quanlin especially instructed Chen Dengke: "The ending part should be highlighted, with a beginning and an end, and Xiong Bin should make the final arrangements." The meaning was not to let the follower of the Chinese Khrushchev's "footsteps," Zhu Yongkang, retreat in disgrace, but to write him as a "heroic figure" who can complete the "great cause" of usurping the party, to sing the praises of the "correctness" and "victory" of the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line.

In June 1964, the revised "In Search of My Father," renamed "Thunderstorm," was published with the title written by the black boss of "San Jia Village," Deng Tuo. This poisonous weed, which Chen Dengke claimed was "created under the guidance of the 'Ten Points,'" stuffed in the black goods from the "Ten Points" and the "Peach Garden Experience," such as "rooting and linking," "opening up bases," and so on. From "In Search of My Father" to "Thunderstorm," it consistently followed the "footsteps" of the Chinese Khrushchev, from the rightist line of 1962 to the "left" in form but right in essence line of 1964, erecting a monument for the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, creating public opinion for the usurpation of the party by the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev.

Li Baohua and his gang often boasted: "Thunderstorm is a work with national influence." The head of the anti-party clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, Peng Zhen, distributed it as a "textbook" to the socialist education work team members in the suburbs of Beijing; the reactionary revisionist elements from the former Central Committee of the Communist Youth League also distributed this poisonous weed to the socialist education work team members, one copy per person, to "arm their thoughts." In just two years, the total print run of "Thunderstorm" reached over a million copies. Under the instructions of the former Ministry of Culture, some people from film studios in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou even competed to adapt it into a movie to spread its poison more widely.

However, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, were clear-eyed and remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." They had long seen through the counter-revolutionary essence of "Thunderstorm" and the evil intentions of its creators, and had written a large number of critical articles and sent them to relevant newspapers and magazines. Upon hearing the news, Chen Dengke boasted: "If 'Thunderstorm' does not fall, I will not fall; if 'Thunderstorm' falls, I am finished." He sought help from Li Baohua and his gang on one hand, and begged for mercy from reactionary academic "authorities" on the other, even using despicable means such as bribery, gift-giving, and banquets to ask them to help "Thunderstorm" pass the review.

In fact, Li Baohua and his gang and the Chinese Khrushchev's agents in the literary world were even more aware of the consequences of "Thunderstorm" falling. They suppressed revolutionary critical articles on one hand and brought out bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" to suppress the revolutionary actions of "small figures" on the other. Since 1962, Chairman Mao had given important instructions to the literary world many times, especially emphasizing the need to grasp class struggle in the ideological realm. Li Baohua, feeling guilty, deliberately spread the theory that "using novels to engage in anti-party activities, we have none here, there might be some errors in the pen," desperately covering up the lid of class struggle in the literary world of Anhui Province, and firmly protecting the counter-revolutionary elements Chen Dengke and his gang.

In November 1965, the head of the reactionary revisionist literary black line, Zhou Yang, summoned Chen Dengke and personally praised the novel, saying it was written well, "without life experience, it cannot be written," boosting Chen Dengke's morale.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the broad revolutionary masses exposed Chen Dengke and further revealed the counter-revolutionary essence of "Thunderstorm." "Thunderstorm" fell, Chen Dengke fell! The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents Li Baohua, Zhou Yang, and the like also fell! This is a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! We must pursue the fleeing enemy and continue to deepen the great criticism, thoroughly criticize and expose the black backstage of the Chinese Khrushchev, as well as his agents Li Baohua, Zhou Yang, and the like, to completely overthrow and denounce them!

    反动小说《风雷》出笼前后
    安徽省批判反动小说《风雷》战斗组
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“利用小说进行反党活动，是一大发明。凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”反动小说《风雷》，正是在中国赫鲁晓夫亲自授意下，由他在安徽的代理人李葆华之流炮制出笼的。《风雷》的出笼，又一次暴露了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，利用小说为他们篡党复辟制造舆论的滔天罪行。
      《风雷》开始炮制是在一九六二年。
    当时，国内外阶级斗争十分激烈。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派勾结在一起，大演反华丑剧。中国赫鲁晓夫也公开跳了出来，伙同国内外阶级敌人，大造反革命舆论，大搞资本主义复辟。在扩大的中央工作会议上，他公然替右倾机会主义分子彭德怀翻案，疯狂叫嚣“对三面红旗不同意，甚至提出自己的路线、纲领都是允许的”。在安徽大组会上，他对李葆华们说：“回去以后，把前三年的历史写本书。如果勇敢些，就把它编剧演，再勇敢些，就立碑传给后代。”他唯恐他的娄罗不敢写，又煽动说：“如果受到打击，可以辞职嘛，等以后路线正确时，你们再来当书记。”什么是中国赫鲁晓夫心目中的“路线正确”之时？这就是他梦寐以求的资本主义复辟成功之日。反骨毕露，何其狂妄！
    中国赫鲁晓夫授意的这个黑使命由谁来完成？李葆华物色的是长期披着“工农作家”外衣的反革命分子陈登科。
    陈登科，这个投靠反革命修正主义文艺黑线头目周扬一伙而青云直上的反革命分子，自称在反右派斗争后“埋着头过了几年日子”，一听到中国赫鲁晓夫的黑指令，顿时得意忘形，贼心毕露。他一边狂热吹捧：“除了他（指中国赫鲁晓夫），谁敢这样讲！”一边疯狂叫嚣：“好罗！现在我自由了！解放了！”这个反革命分子，在半年时间里，就赶制出一部四十五万言的大毒草。
    这部大毒草名叫《寻父记》，即《风雷》的初稿。
    《寻父记》，寥寥三字，包含了一个极端反动的政治命题。陈登科公开叫嚣：“那些吃着淮北农民的小秫秫蒸饼长大的”“担任一定领导职务的党员干部”，已经“忘记了用生命掩护过自己的再生父母”，已经“失去真理”，对人民“漠不关心”，“干出了一些使亲者痛仇者快的勾当”。“‘寻父’，就是寻找人民，寻找党的真理。”
    这一派黑话是有来头的。中国赫鲁晓夫就散布过这种谬论：“党的传统遭到了破坏”，“党和人民的关系疏远了”……够了！原来陈登科亦步亦趋、紧紧追随的，正是中国赫鲁晓夫的“足印”，和中国赫鲁晓夫唱的完全是一个腔调。
    陈登科按照李葆华“不要直接写（前三年）”的反革命策略，借“反映合作化”之名，行“写前三年”之实；并打着“改造落后乡”的幌子，“把中央问题装到基层去写”。陈登科在小说中串起一根“冤狱”和“反冤狱”的黑线，污蔑社会主义农村“万分困难”，其原因在“坏人当道”，“好人受压”。十分清楚，这是一本直接宣扬中国赫鲁晓夫在扩大的中央工作会议上讲话的“精神”的大毒草。
      《寻父记》是一九六二年十二月写成的。当时，具有深远历史意义的八届十中全会已经开过，毛主席发出的千万不要忘记阶级斗争的伟大号召已经传遍全国，毛主席关于社会主义社会阶级、阶级矛盾、阶级斗争的光辉理论，已经深入人心。不久，毛主席又指示在全国城乡开展社会主义教育运动，向正在对我们猖狂进攻的资产阶级进行反击。中国赫鲁晓夫见势不妙，便在新的形势下，玩弄起反革命两面派手法，打着“红旗”反红旗。他把社教运动的口号接了过去，偷梁换柱，抛出一条形“左”实右的反动路线，同毛主席的革命路线相对抗，以达到假四清、真复辟的罪恶目的。
    为了使陈登科的反动小说适合中国赫鲁晓夫反革命策略的需要，李葆华一伙和旧中宣部和旧中国作家协会的反革命修正主义分子，纷纷出谋献策，进一步合伙炮制这株大毒草。
    首先跳出来的是旧中国作协的反革命修正主义分子邵荃麟。他奉旧中宣部“阎王殿”头目周扬、林默涵之命，披阅初稿两遍，接见陈登科三次。他肯定“作品可以出版”，又感到其中“写前三年历史”太露骨，就为陈登科设计画皮，叫他多补缀一些“农业合作化”的章节，以迷惑广大读者。邵荃麟特别关照陈登科：“要突出结尾部分，有头有尾，熊彬最后要作处理”。意思是不让追随中国赫鲁晓夫“足印”的祝永康走得灰溜溜的，而要写成能够完成篡党复辟“大业”的“英雄人物”，用以歌颂中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线的“正确”和“胜利”。
    一九六四年六月，修改后的《寻父记》，改称《风雷》，由“三家村”黑掌柜邓拓亲笔题名出笼了。这株陈登科自称是“在‘后十条’的指导下”炮制成的大毒草，把“后十条”和“桃园经验”中的黑货，什么“扎根串连”，什么“开辟根据地”等都塞了进去。从《寻父记》到《风雷》，一直紧跟着中国赫鲁晓夫的“足印”走，从一九六二年的右倾走到了一九六四年的形“左”实右，给中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线树碑立传，给以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部篡党复辟制造舆论。
    李葆华一伙经常吹嘘：“《风雷》是具有全国影响的好作品”。旧北京市委反党集团头目彭真，把它作为“教科书”发给北京郊区社教工作队员；前团中央的反革命修正主义分子，也把这部毒草发给社教工作队员人手一册，用以“武装思想”。短短两年中，《风雷》的印刷总数竟达百万册以上。在旧文化部指使下，北京、上海和广州等地电影制片厂的一些人，还争着将它改编成电影，以便更广泛地散布其毒素。
    但是，广大的工农兵和无产阶级革命派，心明眼亮，牢记毛主席的教导：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”他们早就识破了《风雷》的反革命实质和炮制者的罪恶用心，曾写出大量批判文章，投寄有关报刊。陈登科闻讯后扬言：“《风雷》不倒我不倒，《风雷》要是倒了，我也就完了。”他一面求救于李葆华一伙，一面乞怜于反动学术“权威”，甚至采用重金贿赂、送礼设宴等卑鄙手段，请他们保《风雷》过关。
    其实，李葆华一伙和中国赫鲁晓夫在文艺界的代理人，更明白“《风雷》倒了”会有什么样的后果。他们一面扣压革命的批判文章，一面搬出资产阶级反动学术“权威”来压制“小人物”的革命行动。自一九六二年以来，毛主席曾多次对文艺界作了重要指示，特别强调要抓意识形态领域里的阶级斗争。李葆华做贼心虚，有意散布“利用小说反党，我们这里没有，可能笔下漏出一点错误”的论调，拚命捂住安徽省文艺界阶级斗争的盖子，死保反革命分子陈登科一伙。
    一九六五年十一月，反革命修正主义文艺黑线总头目周扬召见了陈登科，当面吹捧小说写得不错，“没有生活是写不出来的”，为陈登科撑腰打气。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命群众在毛主席革命路线的指引下，揪出了陈登科，更加深刻地揭露了《风雷》的反革命本质。《风雷》倒了，陈登科倒了！中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人李葆华、周扬之流也倒了！这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！宜将剩勇追穷寇。我们必须乘胜追击，深入地开展革命大批判，把反动小说《风雷》的黑后台中国赫鲁晓夫，以及他的代理人李葆华、周扬之流，彻底批倒、批臭！
