	Eye Signals
	As the global counter-revolutionary collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union tightens, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique is actively courting West German militaristic forces. On June 18, the Soviet revisionist ambassador to the German Democratic Republic respectfully invited West German Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister Brandt for the sixth round of secret talks lasting eight hours, jointly plotting the so-called mutual "renunciation of the use of force" and "improvement" of bilateral relations. On July 15, the Soviet revisionist newspaper *Pravda* published an article stating that the "Soviet government is willing to continue discussions with the Federal Republic of Germany on the non-use of force" and humbly begged the West German militaristic forces to take a "sober and constructive attitude" towards this. The disgusting spectacle of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and West German militaristic forces exchanging signals is truly nauseating.

	For a long time, with the support of U.S. imperialism, the reactionary arrogance of West German militaristic forces has grown increasingly brazen. With impunity, they have been rapidly expanding their military arsenal and attempting to obtain nuclear weapons, while proposing the so-called "new eastern policy," aiming to isolate and eventually annex the German Democratic Republic. From Adenauer to Kissinger, the Bonn ruling clique has never abandoned its aggressive ambitions to annex the German Democratic Republic by force. That Brandt, who was received as an honored guest by the Soviet revisionists, declared in last year's foreign policy statement that the Bonn authorities are the "only government freely elected by the people on German soil" and have a "special obligation to care for national unity." Now, the West German authorities are spreading this so-called "non-use of force" "peace" smokescreen, only to conceal their aggressive intentions and to freely expand and infiltrate the German Democratic Republic in the so-called East-West European "reconciliation" grand bargain orchestrated by the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

	However, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique eagerly picked up the baton, essentially whitewashing West German revanchist forces and hastening their collusion. The Soviet revisionist clique's actions are part of their global counter-revolutionary dealings with U.S. imperialism. In recent times, the clamor for "easing European tensions" and achieving European "reconciliation" has been deafening. The U.S. and the Soviet revisionists, in order to stabilize the European situation and concentrate their forces to suppress the surging revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and to jointly oppose China, are brewing a new counter-revolutionary deal across the entire European region. It is against this backdrop that the Soviet revisionists are even more brazenly betraying the interests of the German Democratic Republic and hastening their collusion with West German militarism. The British bourgeois newspaper *Daily Telegraph* recently commented on the Soviet revisionists' collusion with West Germany, stating: "The Russians seem to want to create 'a quiet zone' in Berlin. This would free their hands to concentrate on other issues, such as the Vietnam problem and the China problem." This statement is not without basis.

	However, as our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "All retrogressive actions end up contrary to the wishes of their proponents. This is true throughout history, both in China and abroad, without exception." The Soviet revisionist traitor clique's collusion with U.S. imperialism and West German militaristic forces, and their betrayal of the interests of the German people and the people of the world, will never succeed. This can only further expose their traitorous faces and hasten their downfall.

    眉来眼去
    随着美苏全球反革命勾结的步步加紧，苏修叛徒集团正在积极同西德军国主义势力勾搭。六月十八日，苏修驻德意志民主共和国大使恭恭敬敬地把西德副总理兼外交部长勃兰特请上门，进行了长达八小时的第六次密谈，共同策划所谓相互“放弃使用武力”和“改善”两国关系的阴谋。七月十五日，苏修《真理报》又发表文章表示，“苏联政府愿意就不使用武力继续同德意志联邦共和国交换意见”，并且低三下四地乞求西德军国主义势力对此“采取清醒的、建设性的态度”。苏修叛徒集团和西德军国主义势力眉来眼去的丑态，实在叫人噁心。
    长期以来，在美帝国主义的支持下，西德军国主义势力的反动气焰愈来愈嚣张。它有恃无恐地一面加紧扩充军备，力图取得核武器；一面提出所谓“新东方政策”，妄图孤立并进而吞并德意志民主共和国。从阿登纳到基辛格，波恩统治集团从来也没有放弃过用武力手段来吞并德意志民主共和国的侵略野心。那个被苏修捧为上宾的勃兰特，在去年的外交政策声明中就叫嚷过，波恩当局“是在德国土地上由人民自由选举的唯一政府”，它有“特别义务来关心民族的统一”。现在西德当局散布这种所谓“不使用武力”的“和平”烟幕，不过是为了掩盖它的侵略面目，以便在美苏合伙策划的所谓东西欧“和解”的总交易中，放手地向德意志民主共和国进行扩张渗透而已。
    然而，苏修叛徒集团却连忙接过腔去，实际上就是要为西德复仇主义势力涂脂抹粉，加紧同它勾结。苏修集团这样做，是它同美帝国主义进行全球反革命交易的一个组成部分。最近一个时期以来，所谓“缓和欧洲局势”，实现欧洲“和解”的叫嚷甚嚣尘上。美帝苏修为了稳住欧洲局势，以便集中力量来对付蓬勃高涨的亚非拉各国人民革命斗争和共同反华，正在整个欧洲地区酝酿着一笔新的反革命交易。正是在这种背景之下，苏修才不惜更加露骨地出卖德意志民主共和国的利益，加紧同西德军国主义的勾搭。英国资产阶级报纸《每日电讯》不久以前在谈到苏修同西德的勾结时曾经写道：“俄国人看来想在柏林建立‘一个平静地区’。这样做，能使他们腾出手来，把精力集中在其他问题上，如越南问题和中国问题。”这种说法并不是没有根据的。
    但是，正如我们的伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：“凡属倒退行为，结果都和主持者的原来的愿望相反。古今中外，没有例外。”苏修叛徒集团勾结美帝和西德军国主义，出卖德国人民和世界人民利益的一切倒行逆施，是决不能得逞的。这只能进一步暴露他们的叛徒面目，加速他们的灭亡。
