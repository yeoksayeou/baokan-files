According to a report from Xinhua News Agency, our correspondent reports: Since the signing of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" eight years ago, and especially since Sato Eisaku became Prime Minister four years ago, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have significantly accelerated the revival of Japanese militarism.

After Sato Eisaku took office, in order to speed up the revival of militarism, he formulated the "Third Military Expansion Plan" (1967 to 1971) based on the "Second Military Expansion Plan" (1962 to 1966) stipulated by the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." This plan's total military expenditure is 234 billion yen, which is double the military expenditure of the "Second Military Expansion Plan" and equivalent to the total military expenditure of Japan over the past fifteen years. The plan decides to increase the army from 145,000 to 180,000 personnel, and to establish anti-guerrilla airborne and armored transport units, mimicking the U.S. forces in Vietnam. It also decides to establish two Hercules missile squadrons and two Hawk missile squadrons in the air force that can be equipped with nuclear warheads. At the same time, it decides to increase naval strength to prepare for overseas deployments.

To serve his American masters, Sato Eisaku has repeatedly advocated extending the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty beyond its ten-year term starting from 1970. At the same time, he is preparing to modify and expedite the implementation of the ongoing "Third Military Expansion Plan" to align Japan's military expansion plans with the possible nuclear armament and other demands that the U.S. might propose after the extension of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," making the revival of militarism even more blatant.

Under the acceleration of the revival of Japanese militarism by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, Japan's military industry has developed rapidly in recent years. Currently, Japan has established a complete military industry system capable of producing aircraft, missiles, tanks, and warships, and it is largely controlled by monopolistic capital. Ten major zaibatsu, including Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Kawasaki, monopolize more than 70% of the production of weapons and military machinery, with Mitsubishi alone monopolizing more than 30% of the military industry.

With the development of Japan's military industry, Japan's role as a weapons factory for U.S. aggression in Asia has become increasingly apparent. A significant portion of the guns, cannons, and ammunition used by U.S. puppets in South Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, and South Korea to slaughter people are imported from Japan.

Since Sato took office, he has also significantly strengthened the propaganda for the revival of militarism. Sato openly declared, "I think the constitutional provision for self-defense to protect the country is insufficient," plotting to amend the constitution early to legalize the full revival of militarism. Sato's accomplice, Fukuda Takeo, the Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party, also shouted, "Raise national defense awareness" and "increase Japan's own defense forces," emphasizing that Japan should have "national spirit" in addition to "economic" strength. The old militarist and police chief Tanao Kichiji, who was appointed as the Minister of Education by the Sato government, openly advocated "national defense education from elementary school," that is, the full restoration of pre-war militarist education. The Director of Japan's "Defense Agency" (equivalent to the Minister of Defense), Masuda Kabutsu, more blatantly shouted in a speech to Japanese army officers on June 6: "The imperial system still exists," "it is better to have the Emperor as the head of state," "I hope the Self-Defense Forces can become the Emperor's 'treasure.'" All of these indicate that the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries will take new steps in accelerating the revival of Japanese militarism.

The heroic Japanese people have been fighting relentlessly for eight years against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the revival of militarism, continuously dealing heavy blows to the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. Despite the strong opposition of the Japanese people, the Sato reactionary government is hastening its military collusion with the U.S. Every evil deed of theirs is a negative example that further awakens the political consciousness of the Japanese people, thereby promoting the development of the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic movement more vigorously.

The great leader of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, said: "The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow American imperialism to ride on its head for long." The Chinese people firmly believe that through a protracted and fierce struggle, the Japanese people will definitely be able to expel American imperialism, bury Japanese militarism, and build an independent and democratic new Japan.

### 增加军费　扩充军队  大造舆论  美日反动派加速复活日本军国主义

    增加军费　扩充军队  大造舆论
    美日反动派加速复活日本军国主义
    据新华社讯　本社记者报道：自从八年前美日反动派签订日美“安全条约”以来，特别是自从四年前佐藤荣作担任内阁首相以来，美日反动派大大地加快了复活日本军国主义的步伐。
    佐藤荣作上台后，为了加速复活军国主义，在根据日美“安全条约”制定的日本“第二次扩军计划”（一九六二年到一九六六年）的基础上，又迫不及待地制定了“第三次扩军计划”（一九六七年到一九七一年）。这项计划的军费总额达两万三千四百亿日元，相当于“第二次扩军计划”军费的两倍，相当于过去十五年日本军费的总和。计划决定把陆军从十四万五千人增加到十八万人，并仿效侵越美军成立反游击战空降部队和装甲运输部队；决定在空军中增设两个可以装核弹头的赫尔克里士式导弹大队和两个隼式导弹大队；同时，决定增加海军力量，为向海外派兵准备条件。
    为了对其美国主子竭尽犬马之劳，佐藤荣作最近一再叫嚷在日美“安全条约”十年期满后，还要从一九七○年起把这个日美军事同盟条约继续延长下去。同时，准备修改和提前完成正在执行的“第三次扩军计划”，以便使日本的扩军计划同美国在日美“安全条约”延期后可能提出的核武装等各项要求相吻合，更露骨地复活军国主义。
    在美日反动派加速复活日本军国主义的情况下，日本的军火工业近几年有了迅速的发展。目前日本已经建立起可以生产飞机、导弹、坦克、军舰等完整的军火工业体系，并且较集中地掌握在垄断资本的手中。三菱、三井、川崎等十家大财阀垄断了武器和军用机械生产的百分之七十以上，其中三菱一家就垄断了军火生产的百分之三十以上。
    随着日本军火工业的发展，日本充当美帝侵略亚洲的兵工厂的作用，也越来越明显。南越、泰国、菲律宾、南朝鲜等美帝仆从用以屠杀人民的枪炮弹药，相当一部分是从日本进口的。
    佐藤上台以来，还大大地加强了复活军国主义的舆论。佐藤公然扬言：“我认为宪法中用自卫力保卫国家的规定是不够的”，阴谋早日修改宪法，使全面复活军国主义合法化。佐藤的同伙、自由民主党干事长福田赳夫也叫嚷“提高国防意识”，“增加日本自己的防卫力量”，强调日本“除了经济这一条腿外”，还应有“民族精神这一条腿”。被佐藤政府启用为文部大臣的老牌军国主义分子、警察头子滩尾弘吉则公开主张，“从小学起”就进行“国防意识教育”，即全面恢复战前的军国主义教育。日本“防卫厅”长官（即国防部长）增田甲子七，六月六日在向日本陆军官兵讲话中更加露骨地叫嚷说：“天皇制至今仍然存在”，“还是以天皇为国家的元首好”，“我希望自卫队能成为天皇的‘御宝’”。所有这些预示着，美日反动派在加速复活日本军国主义的道路上，将要迈出新的步伐。
    英雄的日本人民，八年来一直在前赴后继地进行着反对日美“安全条约”和反对复活军国主义的爱国斗争，不断地给美日反动派以有力打击。佐藤反动政府不顾日本人民的坚决反对，加紧同美帝进行军事勾结，它们的每一罪恶勾当，都是进一步激发日本人民政治觉醒的反面教材，从而促使日本人民的反美爱国运动更加汹涌澎湃地向前发展。
    无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席说：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”中国人民坚信，经过持久的和猛烈的斗争，日本人民一定能够赶走美帝国主义，埋葬日本军国主义，建立起一个独立、民主的新日本。
