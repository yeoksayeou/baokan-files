Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most fundamental aspect of reforming state organs is to connect with the masses."

I am a member of the revolutionary leadership group of the Xining Power Supply Bureau's line route. The practical struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made me increasingly deeply realize: connecting with the masses is like a fish in water; detaching from the masses is like a tree with severed roots.

According to the division of labor in the revolutionary leadership group, I am responsible for the work of revolutionary criticism. Initially, I was full of enthusiasm, setting topics, asking this person to write an article, asking that person to write an article, thinking that the revolutionary criticism column would definitely be well done. Who would have thought that the reality was far from my expectations, and the masses' evaluation of the revolutionary criticism column was not good. Some comrades saw me gesturing all day and began to distance themselves from me. Once, I went to the workers' dormitory, and a worker frankly said, "The official has come today, this is rare!"

These words sounded unpleasant. Isn't this equivalent to saying that I was heading down the wrong path of detaching from the masses? However, when I first heard these words, I did not think in this direction, but rather thought that I was just an ordinary worker, still working together with everyone to carry wood and dig holes, so what is the issue of connecting with the masses? Later, I carefully pondered the masses' criticism and felt more and more that my thoughts were wrong. Although my job had not changed, my status had indeed changed. But how did I manage the revolutionary criticism? One person sets the topics, "dispatching" you to write an article, "dispatching" him to write an article. Is this the style of trusting the masses, relying on the masses, and respecting the masses' pioneering spirit? No wonder I was seen as an "official" by the masses. If I continued this way, how could I not gradually detach from the masses!

This is not accidental. After the revolutionary leadership group was established, a thought emerged: feeling that I had no merit but had suffered, "comfortable and comfortable" was also reasonable. Therefore, actions became casual, study became lax, not wanting to attend meetings would not attend, and work became sloppy. Isn't this the thought of special privileges! With this thought, even if I was still wearing worker's clothes and doing the same work as before, a "gap" or a "wall" would still form between myself and the masses. Chairman Mao earnestly teaches us: "We have become the people's representatives and must represent them well," "Our responsibility is to be accountable to the people. Every word, every action, every policy, must be in the interest of the people. If there are errors, they must be corrected, this is called being accountable to the people." I joined the revolutionary leadership group and was elected by the masses. The masses elected me to serve them, not for the masses to serve me. I only have the duty to serve the people and have no right at all to detach from the masses, gesture at the masses, or even be more special than the masses. Thinking of these things, I deeply felt that I had not fully acted according to Chairman Mao's teachings and had let down Chairman Mao's earnest expectations.

The important editorial "Carry Forward the Party's Style of Close Connection with the Masses" in the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily again sounded the alarm for me. I had heart-to-heart talks with comrades, and comrades helped me find the root of my thoughts and helped me return to the path of being together with the masses. Take the revolutionary criticism for example. We convened a meeting of representatives from the revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, team leaders, and study guides, holding an "Allies' Meeting." Everyone contributed their ideas, and together we came up with many methods, quickly creating a new situation. Previously, it was a few people thinking and writing, now everyone is rushing to the battlefield of revolutionary criticism, and revolutionary criticism is playing a great role in striking the enemy and uniting comrades.

"As long as we rely on the people, firmly believe that the creative power of the masses is boundless, and thus trust the people and unite with them, then any difficulty can be overcome, and any enemy will not be able to press us down, but will be pressed down by us." Chairman Mao's wise teachings are truly the great truth and guiding light for our path of revolutionization!

    联系群众鱼得水脱离群众树断根
    西宁供电所线路革命领导小组成员、工人　瞿国刚
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”
    我是西宁供电所线路革命领导小组的成员。无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，使我越来越深刻地认识到：联系群众，鱼儿得水；脱离群众，树苗断根。
    按照革命领导小组的分工，我负责革命大批判的工作。起初，我满腔热情出题目，请这个写一篇稿子，请那个写一篇稿子，心想一定可以把革命大批判专栏办得好。那里料到，事情同自己设想的差得远，群众对革命大批判专栏的评价并不好。有些同志见到我整天指手划脚，也开始同我疏远了。有一次，我到工人宿舍里去，工人坦率地说：“当官的今天来了，这真难得啊！”
    这句话，听起来很不是味道。这不是等于说，我正在走向脱离群众的歪路吗？然而，刚听到这句话，我却不往这方面想，反而认为，我也是一个普通工人嘛，还不是和大家一起抬木头、挖坑子，还有什么联系不联系群众的问题。后来，我仔细琢磨群众的批评，越来越觉得自己的想法错了。尽管自己的工种没有变，地位却确实变了。可是自己又是怎样管革命大批判的呀，一个人出题目，“派”你写一篇，“派”他写一篇，这是信任群众、依靠群众、尊重群众首创精神的作风吗？怪不得自己在群众眼里，是个“官”了。这样下去，怎能不逐步走向脱离群众啊！
    所以这样，也不是偶然的。革命领导小组成立以后，一个想法冒了出来，觉得自己没有功劳也有苦劳，
  “舒服舒服”也是理所当然。所以，行动随便了，学习松懈了，开会不爱来就不来，工作起来也马马虎虎。这不是特殊化思想是什么！有了这种思想，即使穿的还是工人装，干的还是过去干的活，也会在自己和群众之间形成一道“沟”或者一堵“墙”。毛主席谆谆教导我们：“我们当了人民的代表，必须代表得好”，
  “我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益，如果有了错误，定要改正，这就叫向人民负责。”我参加革命领导小组，是群众推选的。群众推选我，是要自己给群众办事，而不是群众请自己当“老爷”。自己只有为人民服务的义务，决没有丝毫脱离群众，向群众指手划脚，甚至比群众特殊的权利。想着这一些，深深感到自己并没有完全照毛主席的教导办事，对不起毛主席的殷切期望。
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》的重要社论《发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风》，又给我敲起了警钟。我找同志们谈心，同志们帮我找到了思想根源，帮助我重新回到同群众滚在一起的路上来。就说革命大批判吧，我们召集无产阶级革命派和革命群众代表、班组长、学习辅导员，开了一个“诸葛亮会”。大家你一言，我一语，群谋群言，群策群力，想出了好些办法来，很快就出现了新局面。以前是少数人动脑动笔，现在是大家奔向革命大批判的战场，革命大批判正在发挥出打击敌人、团结同志的巨大威力。
      “只要我们依靠人民，坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而信任人民，和人民打成一片，那就任何困难也能克服，任何敌人也不能压倒我们，而只会被我们所压倒。”毛主席的英明教导，真是照耀我们的革命化道路的伟大真理和指路明灯！　（新华社）
