As a former soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and a participant in the raid on the "White Tiger Regiment," after watching the revolutionary model opera "Raiding the White Tiger Regiment," I felt extremely excited and moved!

The revolutionary warriors on the cultural front, under the personal leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. With a spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, they have launched a fierce attack on the most stubborn stronghold of Peking opera art. The heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, have proudly stepped onto the socialist stage of literature and art, driving away all the emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties. History, which had been turned upside down, has been turned right side up again. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art. We must shout a thousand times: Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live for ten thousand years!

"The Raiding the White Tiger Regiment" is a great play! It is great because it prominently depicts and praises the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the people's army armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Lin Biao has instructed us: "All our achievements and victories are gained under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, and they are all victories of Mao Zedong Thought." I have a deep understanding of this. The great victory of the movement to resist America and aid Korea, and the brilliant achievements of raiding the "White Tiger Regiment," were all achieved under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

In the battle to raid the "White Tiger Regiment," we faced the ferocious American imperialists and the mercenary armies of more than ten puppet states. The "White Tiger Regiment" was an elite unit of the Li puppet army's capital division, fully equipped with American weapons and commanded by American advisors. However, our thirteen-man spearhead team took only thirteen minutes to destroy the "White Tiger Regiment" headquarters, seize the "White Tiger Regiment" flag, kill the "White Tiger Regiment" commander, and force the American advisor to kneel on the ground begging for mercy. What power enabled us to create such a miracle? It was the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Throughout the entire battle, we firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "This army possesses an indomitable spirit. It will vanquish all enemies and will never be subdued by them." "Resolve to fight to the end, fearing no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to win victory." It was Chairman Mao's teachings that enabled us to dare to defy all ferocious enemies, to establish a firm resolve to dare to struggle and dare to win; it was Chairman Mao's teachings that made us fear neither heaven nor earth, nor any difficulties, nor death. "Fear not the mountain of knives or the sea of fire, with a heart of red for the people." It was Mao Zedong Thought that inspired us to bravely and wisely break through all obstacles, overcome all difficulties, and strike at the enemy's heart. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we were able to fight ten for one and a hundred for one, wreaking havoc in the enemy's heart and smashing their elite forces to pieces in just a few minutes!

The revolutionary modern Peking opera "Raiding the White Tiger Regiment" vividly recreates the historical truth of the Korean battlefield of yesteryears. It powerfully exposes and criticizes the "philosophy of survival" and "capitulationism" of the Chinese Khrushchov. The Chinese Khrushchov is a typical coward. He kneels before the enemy and surrenders, shamelessly advocating "love for oneself" and "protecting one's life and health." This is a thorough and complete philosophy of betrayal, a thorough and complete capitulationism! If we had followed the Chinese Khrushchov's line, the newly born China would have been handed over to American imperialism long ago, and there would be no talk of the great victory of resisting America and aiding Korea! We, the hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians, must rise up with the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, just as we annihilated the "White Tiger Regiment," and thoroughly criticize, expose, overthrow, and denounce the revisionist line represented by the Chinese Khrushchov!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Literature and art should become a component part of the revolutionary machine as a whole, as a powerful weapon for uniting and educating the people and for attacking and annihilating the enemy, to help the people fight the enemy heart and soul." The profound significance of "Raiding the White Tiger Regiment" lies in its use of the great victory of the war to resist America and aid Korea to tell people: Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. It is like a resounding war drum, inspiring revolutionary people to fight bravely and unyieldingly, and to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors and all their running dogs!

"The Raiding the White Tiger Regiment" is a good play that propagates Mao Zedong Thought, a fragrant flower on the stage of proletarian revolutionary literature and art. We hope that our comrades in the literary and artistic circles will raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, advance with victory, firmly defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art, thoroughly smash the black line of revolutionary revisionism in literature and art, and fight for the further flourishing of proletarian new literature and art!

    毛泽东思想的胜利凯歌
    济南部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子奇袭“白虎团”一级战斗英雄  杨育才
    作为一个前中国人民志愿军战士，作为奇袭“白虎团”的参加者，看了革命样板戏《奇袭白虎团》以后，感到无比兴奋！无比激动！
    文艺战线上的广大革命战士，在江青同志的亲自率领下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，向京剧艺术这个最顽固的堡垒，展开了猛烈的进攻。闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的工农兵英雄形象，昂首阔步登上了社会主义的文艺舞台，把帝王将相、才子佳人通通赶跑，被颠倒了的历史再颠倒过来了。这是毛主席的革命文艺路线的伟大胜利。我们要千万遍高呼：伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
      《奇袭白虎团》这出戏好得很！好就好在它突出地表现和歌颂了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，表现和歌颂了毛泽东思想武装起来的人民军队。
    林彪同志指示我们：“我们的一切成就，一切胜利，都是在毛主席的英明领导下取得的，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。”这点我的体会很深。抗美援朝运动的伟大胜利，奇袭“白虎团”的辉煌战绩，都是在毛泽东思想指导下取得的。
    在奇袭“白虎团”这次战斗中，站在我们面前的是凶恶的美帝国主义和十几个仆从国家的帮凶军。“白虎团”是参加过第二次世界大战的李伪军首都师精锐师团，全部是美式装备，并由美国顾问指挥。但是我们尖刀班十三个人，只用了十三分钟的时间，就捣毁了“白虎团”团部，缴获了“白虎团”团旗，击毙了“白虎团”团长，打得美国顾问跪在地下求我们饶命。是什么力量使我们创造出这样的奇迹？是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。在整个战斗过程中，我们牢牢记住毛主席的教导：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”是毛主席的教导，使我们敢于蔑视一切凶恶的敌人，树立起敢于斗争敢于胜利的坚定信心；是毛主席的教导，使我们天不怕，地不怕，难不怕，死不怕，“刀山火海何所惧，一片红心为人民”。是毛泽东思想，鼓舞我们英勇机智地冲破重重障碍，闯过座座难关，直插敌人心脏。毛泽东思想武装了我们，才使我们一以当十，百以当千，在敌人的心脏里东冲西杀，在短短的十几分钟内就把敌人的王牌军砸了个稀巴烂！
    革命现代京剧《奇袭白虎团》生动地再现了当年朝鲜战场上的历史真实。它有力地揭露和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“活命哲学”和“投降主义”。中国赫鲁晓夫是个典型的怕死鬼。他在敌人面前屈膝投降，还恬不知耻地说什么要“钟爱自己”，“保护自己的生命与健康”。这是彻头彻尾的叛徒哲学，彻头彻尾的投降主义！如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫这一套去做，新生的中国早就送给美帝国主义了，还谈得上什么抗美援朝的伟大胜利！我们亿万军民，一定要奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，象全歼“白虎团”一样，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的反革命修正主义路线彻底批深、批透，批倒、批臭！
    毛主席教导我们：“要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”《奇袭白虎团》的深远意义，就在于它通过抗美援朝战争的伟大胜利的史实告诉人们：帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。它象一面擂响的战鼓，鼓舞着革命人民，前赴后继，英勇战斗，彻底打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！
    《奇袭白虎团》是一出宣传毛泽东思想的好戏，是无产阶级革命文艺舞台上的一朵香花。我们希望文艺界的战友们，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，乘胜前进，坚决捍卫毛主席的革命文艺路线，彻底摧毁反革命修正主义文艺黑线，为进一步繁荣无产阶级的新文艺而战斗！
