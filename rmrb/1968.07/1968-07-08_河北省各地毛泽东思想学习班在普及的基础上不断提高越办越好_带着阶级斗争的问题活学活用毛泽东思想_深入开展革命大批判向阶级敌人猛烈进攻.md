Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various parts of Hebei Province have continuously improved on the basis of widespread coverage, actively promoting class struggle and the use of Mao Zedong Thought. They have deeply launched revolutionary criticism and launched fierce attacks on class enemies.

Mao Zedong's revolutionary line has been further ingrained in the hearts of the people, and the masses' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines has been further heightened. The counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev has been further criticized, and revolutionary unity and revolutionary committees have been further consolidated and developed.

Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, July 7 — Under the leadership of revolutionary committees at various levels and with the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various parts of Hebei Province have organized students to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, continuously raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They have deeply and persistently launched revolutionary criticism, making the study classes better and better, continuously improving on the basis of widespread coverage, and becoming a stronghold for attacking class enemies.

Under the leadership of revolutionary committees at various levels, Mao Zedong Thought study classes in urban and rural areas of Hebei Province have developed rapidly. By March of this year, they had basically been popularized. Through the widespread establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has entered a broader and deeper new stage. The broad revolutionary masses have deeper feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions have been further implemented, promoting the continuous development of the revolution and production.

In late March, the Hebei Revolutionary Committee held a plenary meeting to summarize the experience of establishing and improving Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In light of the new situation of the deepening of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it proposed measures and made corresponding decisions to further improve Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The decision requires: The establishment of study classes must follow Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle" and firmly grasp class struggle. Study classes must seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, and policies on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and study and apply Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, continuously raising awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They must deeply and persistently launch revolutionary criticism and actively and unceasingly launch fierce attacks on a handful of class enemies.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution launched by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the reactionary Kuomintang led by the broad revolutionary masses and the people, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's latest instruction has further clarified the direction for the establishment and improvement of Mao Zedong Thought study classes for various levels of revolutionary committees in Hebei Province. Many regions' study classes have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions while addressing local class struggle issues, analyzed the new situation and characteristics of class struggle, and further launched a high tide of revolutionary criticism. The broad revolutionary masses have launched even fiercer attacks on a handful of class enemies.

Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various parts of Hebei Province have firmly grasped class struggle and deeply launched revolutionary criticism, adopting the following practices:

First, they have conducted extensive class education and mobilized the masses. Many regions in the province have conducted extensive "remembering bitterness and thinking of sweetness" class education in various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. For example, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Tangjiazhuang Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine have organized revolutionary workers to repeatedly study and understand Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle, and then guided the masses to recall their family's history of liberation and the history of workers' struggles. Broad revolutionary workers have raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, deepened their hatred for class enemies, and held criticism meetings, exposing and criticizing class enemies, promoting the deepening of the struggle against enemies.

Second, they have conducted policy education and firmly grasped the direction of the struggle. After the masses have been widely mobilized, the study classes have timely organized revolutionary masses to study the Party's policies and strategies for struggling against enemies, guiding everyone to distinguish between two types of contradictions in the complex class struggle, uniting all those who can be united, and isolating and fiercely striking a handful of class enemies to the greatest extent.

Third, they have cultivated cadres and organized class forces. Through the widespread establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, revolutionary committees at the county and commune levels in Hebei have cultivated a core force of class struggle consisting of militia members, Communist Party members, and poor and lower-middle peasants in rural areas. They are distributed in production team study classes, field study classes, and study classes for a few households, using every opportunity to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the community members, and studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought with the community members, analyzing new trends in class struggle, and fully playing the leading role of the core force. In this way, one person leads the whole family, and one household leads a piece, forming a revolutionary army to attack class enemies.

Fourth, they have closely combined with the current production tasks, deeply launched revolutionary criticism, and combined criticism of revisionism with self-criticism. For example, during the recent "three summer" busy agricultural season, various places have fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, such as "work points in command," raised the masses' awareness of the line struggle, and promoted production.

"Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various parts of Hebei Province have firmly grasped class struggle, deeply launched revolutionary criticism, making the study classes better and better, and continuously developing. Currently, the number of cadres and masses participating in various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the province has increased from 20 million two months ago to more than 23 million. In places like Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, and Shijiazhuang, 80 to 90 percent of the population and 60 to 80 percent of the households have participated in the study. The counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Hebei has been further exposed and criticized; the great Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line have been further ingrained in the hearts of the people, and the broad revolutionary masses' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines has been further heightened. Currently, under the leadership of revolutionary committees at various levels, the broad revolutionary masses in the province are closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions. In the class struggle, revolutionary unity and the newly born revolutionary committees have been further consolidated and developed. Under the impetus of the revolution, the level of industrial and agricultural production in the province has continuously risen, and the revolutionary and production situation has become better and better.

    河北省各地毛泽东思想学习班在普及的基础上不断提高越办越好
    带着阶级斗争的问题活学活用毛泽东思想
    深入开展革命大批判向阶级敌人猛烈进攻
    毛主席的革命路线更加深入人心，广大群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟更加提高，中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线受到进一步批判，革命大联合和革委会不断巩固和发展
    新华社石家庄七日电　河北省各地的毛泽东思想学习班，在各级革命委员会的领导和人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，组织学员们带着阶级斗争中的问题，活学活用毛泽东思想，不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，深入持久地开展革命大批判，使学习班越办越好，在普及的基础上不断提高，成为向阶级敌人进攻的坚强阵地。
    在各级革命委员会的领导下，河北省城乡各地的毛泽东思想学习班发展很快，到今年三月就基本上普及了。通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动，进入了一个更加广泛、更加深入的新阶段。广大革命群众对伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级感情更加深厚，毛主席的一系列最新指示进一步落实，推动了革命和生产不断向前发展。
    河北省革命委员会在三月底召开的全体会议上，总结了大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班的经验，根据无产阶级文化大革命不断深入发展的新形势，提出了进一步办好毛泽东思想学习班的措施，作出了相应的决定。决定要求：办学习班，必须遵照毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，狠抓阶级斗争。学习班要认真活学活用毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，活学活用毛主席的一系列最新指示，不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，深入持久地开展革命大批判，主动地、不停顿地向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席这一最新指示，使河北省各级革委会进一步明确了大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班的方向。许多地区的学习班，带着当地阶级斗争中的问题，活学活用毛主席的最新指示，分析了阶级斗争的新形势、新特点，进一步掀起了革命大批判的高潮，广大革命群众向一小撮阶级敌人展开了更加猛烈的进攻。
    河北省各地毛泽东思想学习班狠抓阶级斗争，深入开展革命大批判，采用了以下几种做法：
    一、大抓阶级教育，广泛地发动群众。全省许多地区的毛泽东思想学习班普遍地开展了忆苦思甜的阶级教育。如开滦煤矿唐家庄矿的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，组织革命职工反复学习领会毛主席有关阶级斗争的教导，然后引导群众回顾家庭翻身史、矿工斗争史。广大革命职工提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，加深了对阶级敌人的仇恨，纷纷举行批判会，对阶级敌人展开了揭发、批判，推动了对敌斗争深入开展。
    二、进行政策教育，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向。在群众普遍发动起来以后，学习班又及时组织革命群众学习党的对敌斗争的政策和策略，引导大家在复杂的阶级斗争中，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的人，最大限度地孤立和狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人。
    三、培养骨干，组织阶级队伍。通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，河北各县、社革委会已在农村中培养出一支以民兵、共产党员、贫下中农为中心的阶级斗争骨干力量。他们分布在作业组学习班、田头学习班、三家两户学习班，利用一切场合，向社员群众宣传毛主席的最新指示，和社员一起活学活用毛泽东思想，分析阶级斗争的新动向，充分发挥骨干带头作用。这样，一人带全家，一户带一片，组成了向阶级敌人进攻的革命大军。
    四、紧密结合当前生产任务，深入开展革命大批判，并且把批修和斗私结合起来。例如最近“三夏”农忙中，各地狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的“工分挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货，提高了社员的路线斗争觉悟，促进了生产。
      “阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”河北省各地的毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓阶级斗争，深入开展革命大批判，使学习班越办越好，不断发展。目前，全省参加各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班的干部和群众，已由两个月前的两千万人增加到两千三百多万人。张家口、唐山、石家庄等地有百分之八十到九十以上的人口、百分之六十到八十的家庭，参加了学习。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在河北的代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线，受到了进一步的揭发和批判；伟大的毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加深入人心，广大革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟更加提高。目前，全省广大革命群众正在各级革命委员会的领导下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。在阶级斗争中，革命的大联合和新生的革命委员会不断巩固和发展。在革命的推动下，全省工农业生产水平节节上升，革命和生产形势越来越好。
