How to fight a political battle in the economic field? The experience of Nanjing Puzhen Vehicle Factory is:

	Resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of seizing the revolution and promoting production.

	Since January last year, when the proletarian revolutionary faction took power, the entire factory has completed and exceeded production tasks month after month and quarter after quarter. Every achievement in their production is a victory won through fierce struggles against class enemies.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 11 — The proletarian revolutionary faction and the broad revolutionary masses of Nanjing Puzhen Vehicle Factory, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, have steadfastly implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." They have insisted on using revolution to lead production, and both revolution and production have achieved great victories. Since January last year, when the proletarian revolutionary faction took power in this factory, the entire factory has completed and exceeded production tasks month after month and quarter after quarter. This year, production has surged ahead, and in the second quarter, the factory set new historical high records for three consecutive months. The production level in the first half of this year compared to the highest production level in 1966, before the Cultural Revolution, has increased by 9%, and the quality of the products has significantly improved.

	Puzhen Vehicle Factory is one of the main factories in China for repairing passenger cars. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of class enemies deliberately disrupted and sabotaged the normal production of this factory, attempting to use the disruption of production to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The living class struggle facts made the proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory deeply realize that production is not just an economic battle, but a sharp and complex class struggle, a political battle in the economic field. Over the past year and a half, every achievement in their production has been a victory won through fierce struggles against class enemies. How to fight a political battle in the economic field? They have the following experiences:

	Make Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" a conscious revolutionary action of the workers.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Mastering ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles. If this task is not solved, the Party's political tasks cannot be completed." The proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, has, in conjunction with the characteristics of class struggle at each stage, repeatedly studied and propagated the great significance of Chairman Mao's instructions on "seizing the revolution and promoting production." They have raised the issue of seizing the revolution and promoting production to the height of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, making it deeply rooted in the minds of every worker and turning it into a conscious action.

	In January last year, after the proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory seized power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, they organized the broad masses of workers to seriously study and deeply understand Chairman Mao's great teachings on "seizing the revolution and promoting production" and the telegram from the Party Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group congratulating the Shanghai January Revolution. Through the study, everyone realized that whether they could seize the revolution and promote production well was a major issue related to consolidating and developing the victory of the seizure of power struggle, a major issue related to whether they could hold power and use power well. Everyone expressed their determination to do well in both revolution and production, to bring glory to Chairman Mao, and to show the spirit of the proletarian revolutionary faction. The broad revolutionary masses, while fiercely criticizing and denouncing the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, displayed tremendous revolutionary enthusiasm in production, working together, supporting each other, overcoming various difficulties deliberately created by the capitalist roaders, and completing 73% of the monthly work within half a month, winning the first battle of seizing the revolution and promoting production.

	In March last year, after the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a letter to revolutionary workers and cadres in factories and mines across the country, the proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary workers of this factory studied it again. The workers said: "This letter is written by Chairman Mao for us. The great policy of 'seizing the revolution and promoting production' was proposed by Chairman Mao. Whether or not to resolutely implement this great policy is a major issue of defending or not defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, a major issue of testing whether we can become true proletarian revolutionaries." On the basis of further raising their awareness, the entire factory launched a wave of expressing determination, taking measures, and striving to be pioneers in seizing the revolution and models in promoting production. Whenever production tasks were assigned, production meetings were held, and production issues were discussed, they repeatedly studied this letter, continuously implemented its spirit, making seizing the revolution and promoting production the guiding principle and driving force for the broad revolutionary masses.

	When the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution entered the stage of achieving comprehensive victory, the revolutionary committees of the factory and workshops held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organizing workers to seriously study Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and the spirit of the national railway and transportation conference, making the broad masses of workers realize that promoting the great development of production through revolution is an important aspect of achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Everyone is determined to continue to strive for new victories in revolution and production.

	Continuously analyze the new situation of class struggle, and launch a fierce attack on the new conspiracies of class enemies to sabotage production.

	Chairman Mao said: "Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until they are destroyed—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." Over the past year, the proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory has continuously analyzed the new situation and new problems of class struggle, timely grasped the new moves of class enemies, launched fierce attacks on class enemies, and smashed their various conspiracies to sabotage production.

	In July last year, when the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the Nanjing area of Jiangsu was intense, class enemies used the extreme "leftist" trend in society to slander the proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory, incite them against the People's Liberation Army, and at the same time, in every possible way, incite bourgeois factionalism among revolutionary masses, disrupting the grand direction of the struggle. Workers' thoughts were somewhat confused, and the attendance rate dropped significantly, threatening August's production. The proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory saw through the evil conspiracies of class enemies, immediately held a meeting, and launched a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, launching a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. Through the efforts of the entire factory's workers, the production task for August was completed, smashing the class enemies' sabotage conspiracies.

	When class enemies saw that openly sabotaging production was no longer effective, they adopted more covert methods. At the beginning of this year, under the instigation of a handful of class enemies, anarchist thoughts spread in the factory, affecting production. The proletarian revolutionary faction quickly realized that this was a new trick of class enemies to sabotage production. They guided the broad revolutionary masses to carry out activities of recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, fiercely criticizing the reactionary nature of anarchism. Many old workers said excitedly: "The eight-hour workday is what Chairman Mao led us workers to fight for. Now someone does not follow the eight-hour workday; he is either a bad person or a good person who has forgotten his roots, disloyal to Chairman Mao." Class education raised the class struggle and two-line struggle awareness of the broad revolutionary masses, strengthening their political responsibility as masters of the state. On this basis, they further mobilized revolutionary workers to thoroughly expose the roots of anarchism, exposing a handful of class enemies who were instigating evil winds and ghost fires behind the scenes. The workers' attendance rate quickly rose, the utilization rate of working hours greatly increased, and production continued to increase.

	Deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, using revolution to lead production.

	For a long time, China's Khrushchev and his agents in the railway department pushed a set of revisionist goods in this factory, seriously restricting the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers and affecting the development of productive forces. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary faction of this factory, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "not breaking means not establishing. Breaking is criticism, is revolution. Breaking means to reason, reasoning is establishing, breaking comes first, and establishing is within it," carried out deep revolutionary criticism of the reactionary line of the revisionists at the workshop level and the team as the base, making the revolutionary consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses greatly improved, thoughts greatly liberated, and promoting the great development of productive forces.

	In the revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of workers closely linked the criticism of the current reactionary activities of class enemies in sabotaging the revolution and production with the revolutionary criticism of China's Khrushchev. When class enemies maliciously slandered the proletarian revolutionary faction as "only able to make revolution, not able to make production," they fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev's revisionist line of "experts running the factory"; when class enemies spread the poison of counter-revolutionary economism, they exposed the harm of China's Khrushchev's advocacy of "money as the commander" and "material incentives"; when class enemies incited anarchist thoughts, they criticized China's Khrushchev's advocacy of the mercenary idea that workers work just to "earn money" and "support the family." In this way, the content of the revolutionary criticism was specific, the target was clear, the criticism was deep, and the exposure was thorough. The proletarian consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses was higher and higher, and their hatred for class enemies was greater and greater.

	Through revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary masses firmly established the idea of working for the revolution. New types of relationships were established among people, among processes, among teams, and between superiors and subordinates. Overlapping administrative structures were broken, and non-production personnel were greatly reduced. The revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers were released, and production enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high. They displayed the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and dare to do, successfully implementing many new technologies and new processes that the capitalist roaders thought could not be done. Over the past year, the entire factory has implemented nearly 200 major technological innovation projects, improving labor productivity and improving the working conditions of workers.

	Unite the majority of the masses and cadres, forming a revolutionary army to seize the revolution and promote production.

	Chairman Mao said: "Organizing tens of millions of people and mobilizing a vast revolutionary army is the need of today's revolution to attack counter-revolution." The proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory, in the struggle, strictly distinguished between two different types of contradictions, united all forces that could be united, mobilized all positive factors, continuously consolidated and strengthened the unity of the revolutionary ranks, and formed a revolutionary army with unified thoughts and coordinated steps to seize the revolution and promote production.

	To unite the majority of the masses, the proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory strictly distinguished between two different types of contradictions, doing the following three correct treatments:

	Correctly treat the masses who took the wrong side in the early stages of the movement. The proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "striving to unite with all those who can be united. The proletariat not only liberates itself but also liberates all mankind," with deep proletarian feelings, did a lot of in-depth and detailed ideological work for the masses who took the wrong side in the early stages of the movement. They studied and applied Chairman Mao's works together with these masses, carried out revolutionary criticism together, helping them raise their class struggle and two-line struggle awareness. Now, many masses who took the wrong side in the early stages of the movement have become active elements in seizing the revolution and promoting production, achieving new results.

	Correctly treat the masses within the proletarian revolutionary faction who have different opinions. At the beginning, some comrades did not pay enough attention to this, and some antagonistic emotions arose among them, affecting the revolution and production. With the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, they, through study, distinguished who the enemies were and who the friends were, each fiercely criticized the bourgeois factionalism in their own minds, strengthened proletarian party spirit, and the entire factory established a unified "Proletarian Revolutionary Faction Headquarters," further strengthening the unity of the revolutionary ranks on the principle of Mao Zedong Thought, consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination by workshop and by team, promoting the development of the revolution and production.

	Correctly treat the minority backward masses. In the face of the great situation where the entire factory's revolution is advancing step by step and production is rising step by step, a few workers have lax discipline, and both revolution and production are not good. How to treat these workers? Some people advocated using administrative measures to "restrain" them. However, the proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory believed that these workers were backward mainly because their class education was not tightened, and using the "restrain" method could not educate them ideologically. Thus, the revolutionary faction workers, in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, in the attacks on a handful of class enemies, paid attention to using the class struggle facts of their own factory and department to educate these workers, and actively cared for them, trusted them, helping these workers raise their class awareness, actively fought their selfishness, and actively participated in the class struggle and production struggle.

	The proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory also resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's line on cadres. They, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "believing that more than 90% of the cadres are good and relatively good. Those who have made mistakes, the majority can be reformed," adopted the attitude of "punishing the past and preventing the future, curing the illness and saving the person" and "one look, two helps" towards cadres who had made mistakes, even serious mistakes. Every week, they organized them to study Mao Zedong Thought in conjunction with the actual class struggle in the factory, study the theory, line, policy, and principles of the great leader Chairman Mao on continuing the revolution under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, helping revolutionary cadres raise their class struggle and two-line struggle awareness, correctly treat the masses, correctly treat themselves, and keep up with the rapidly developing new situation. On the other hand, they fully played the role of revolutionary cadres, tested, tempered, and promoted them in their work, and supported them to work boldly. After the proletarian revolutionary faction took power, they established production leadership teams from top to bottom, consisting of representatives of the proletarian revolutionary faction and cadres. Over the past year, no matter how much interference there was or how many difficulties there were, these production leadership teams always insisted on working, playing a very important role in ensuring the normal operation of the entire factory's production and continuously improving the production level.

    怎样打好经济领域里的政治仗？南京浦镇车辆厂的体会是：
    坚决贯彻毛主席抓革命促生产伟大方针
    全厂从去年一月无产阶级革命派掌权以来，月月、季季完成和超额完成生产任务。他们在生产上的每一个成绩，都是和阶级敌人进行激烈搏斗取得的胜利
    据新华社南京十一日电　南京浦镇车辆工厂的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，坚定不移地贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，坚持以革命统帅生产，革命和生产都取得了巨大胜利。从去年一月份这个厂的无产阶级革命派掌权以来，全厂月月、季季完成和超额完成生产任务。今年以来，生产更是突飞猛进，第二季度连续三个月创造本厂历史最高纪录。今年上半年的生产水平同文化大革命前生产水平最高的一九六六年同期相比，产量增加百分之九，产品质量显著提高。
    浦镇车辆工厂是我国修理客车的主要工厂之一。在无产阶级文化大革命中，一小撮阶级敌人处心积虑地干扰和破坏这个厂的正常生产，妄图以破坏生产来破坏无产阶级文化大革命。活生生的阶级斗争事实使这个厂的无产阶级革命派深刻认识到，搞生产决不是单纯的经济仗，而是一场尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争，是经济领域里的一场政治仗。一年半以来，他们在生产上的每一个成绩，都是和阶级敌人进行激烈搏斗取得的胜利。怎样打好经济领域里的政治仗？他们有以下几点体会：
      使“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针
    成为职工自觉的革命行动
    毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”这个厂的无产阶级革命派，在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，结合各个阶段阶级斗争的特点，反复学习和宣传伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”指示的伟大意义，把抓革命促生产提高到阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的高度来认识，使抓革命、促生产在每一个职工的头脑里深深扎下根子，变为自觉的行动。
    去年一月，这个厂的无产阶级革命派从党内一小撮走资派手里夺权以后，就组织广大职工认真学习和深刻领会毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导和党中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革给上海一月革命的贺电。通过学习使大家认识到，能不能抓好革命，促好生产，是关系到能不能巩固和发展夺权斗争胜利的大问题，是关系到能不能掌好权、用好权的大问题。大家表示一定要把革命和生产都搞好，为毛主席争光，为无产阶级革命派争气。广大革命职工一面狠斗、狠批党内一小撮走资派，一面在生产上发挥冲天的革命干劲，团结协作，互相支援，克服走资派蓄意制造的种种困难，用半个月的时间，胜利完成了全月百分之七十三的工作量，打好了抓革命促生产的第一仗。
    去年三月，中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信发表后，这个厂的无产阶级革命派和革命职工又认真学习。职工们说：“这封信是毛主席写给我们的。‘抓革命，促生产’的伟大方针是毛主席提出来的。是不是坚决贯彻这一伟大方针，是捍卫不捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的重大问题，是考验我们能不能成为真正无产阶级革命派的大问题。”在认识进一步提高的基础上，全厂掀起了表决心，订措施，人人争当抓革命的闯将，个个争做促生产的模范的热潮。每逢布置生产任务、开生产会议、研究生产问题，他们都反复学习这封信，不断贯彻这封信的精神，使抓革命促生产成为广大革命职工行动的指南，前进的动力。
    当全国无产阶级文化大革命进入夺取全面胜利的阶段时，厂和车间的革命委员会又大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，组织职工认真学习毛主席的一系列最新指示和全国铁路、交通会议精神，使广大职工认识到，以革命带头促进生产的大发展，这是当前夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一个重要方面。大家决心再接再厉，夺取革命和生产的新胜利。
      不断分析阶级斗争的新形势，迎头痛
    击阶级敌人破坏生产的新阴谋
    毛主席说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”一年多来，这个厂的无产阶级革命派不断分析阶级斗争的新形势、新问题，及时掌握阶级敌人的新动向，向阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻，粉碎了阶级敌人破坏生产的种种阴谋。
    去年七月份，江苏南京地区两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争十分激烈的时候，阶级敌人利用社会上的极“左”思潮，污蔑这个厂的无产阶级革命派，挑拨他们同解放军的关系，同时千方百计地在革命群众中煽动资产阶级派性，干扰斗争大方向。职工思想一度比较混乱，出勤率大幅度下降，八月份的生产受到严重威胁。这个厂的无产阶级革命派识破了阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋，立即召开大会，主动向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，掀起了革命大批判的新高潮。经过全厂职工的努力，完成了八月份的生产任务，粉碎了阶级敌人的破坏阴谋。
    阶级敌人看到明火执仗地破坏生产不行了，就采取了更加隐蔽的方法。今年年初，在一小撮阶级敌人煽动下，无政府主义思潮在厂里泛滥起来，影响了生产。无产阶级革命派迅速察觉到这是阶级敌人破坏生产的新花招。他们就引导广大革命职工开展忆苦思甜活动，狠批无政府主义的反动性。许多老工人激动地说：“八小时工作制是毛主席领导我们工人斗争得来的。现在有人不遵守八小时工作制，他不是坏人，就是好人忘了本，对毛主席不忠。”阶级教育提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，增强了他们作为国家主人翁的政治责任感。在这基础上，进一步发动革命职工大挖无政府主义的根源，挖出了在背后煽阴风点鬼火的一小撮阶级敌人。职工们出勤率迅速上升，工时利用率大大提高，生产不断增加。
      深入持久地开展革命大批判，用革命
    统帅生产
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁路部门的代理人，长期以来在这个工厂推行了一套修正主义黑货，严重地束缚了职工的革命积极性，影响了生产力的发展。无产阶级文化大革命中，这个厂的革命派遵照毛主席“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了”的教导，以车间为单位，以班组为基点，对反革命修正主义路线深入开展革命的大批判，使广大革命职工觉悟大提高，思想大解放，促进了生产力的大发展。
    在革命大批判中，广大职工把批判阶级敌人破坏革命和生产的现行反动活动同对中国赫鲁晓夫的革命大批判紧密结合起来。当阶级敌人大肆污蔑无产阶级革命派“只能搞革命，不能搞生产”的时候，他们就大批特批中国赫鲁晓夫“专家治厂”的修正主义路线；当阶级敌人散布反革命经济主义毒素时，他们就大揭大诉中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“金钱挂帅”、“物质刺激”的危害；当阶级敌人煽动无政府主义思潮时，他们就批判中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹工人做工就是“拿钱”、“养家”的雇佣思想。这样，革命大批判的内容具体，目标明确，批得深，挖得透，广大革命职工的无产阶级觉悟越批越高，对阶级敌人越批越恨。
    通过革命大批判，广大革命职工牢固地确立了为革命做工的思想。人与人之间、工序与工序之间、班组与班组之间、上下级之间建立了新型的关系。重叠的行政机构被打破了，非生产人员大量减少。广大职工的革命积极性和创造性焕发出来了，生产热情空前高涨。他们发扬敢想、敢干的革命精神，搞成功了过去走资派认为无法搞成的许多新技术、新工艺。一年多来，全厂实现了近两百个较大的技术革新项目，提高了劳动生产率，改善了职工的劳动条件。
      团结大多数群众和干部，组成抓革命
           促生产的革命大军
    毛主席说：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”这个厂的无产阶级革命派在斗争中严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的力量，调动一切积极因素，不断巩固和加强革命队伍的团结，把全厂革命群众和革命干部组成一支思想统一、步伐整齐的抓革命促生产的革命大军。
    为了团结大多数群众，这个厂的无产阶级革命派严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，做到三个正确对待：
    正确对待运动初期站错队的群众。这个厂的无产阶级革命派遵照毛主席“要争取团结一切可以团结的人们。无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类”的教导，怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，对运动初期站错队的群众，做了大量深入细致的思想工作。他们和这些群众一起活学活用毛主席著作，一起搞革命大批判，帮助他们提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。现在，许多运动初期站错队的群众，成了抓革命促生产中的积极分子，作出了新的成绩。
    正确对待无产阶级革命派内部不同观点的群众。开始有些同志对这一点注意不够，相互之间产生了一些对立情绪，影响了革命和生产。在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，他们通过学习，分清了谁是敌人，谁是朋友，各自狠斗自己头脑中的资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，全厂成立了统一的“无产阶级革命派总部”，进一步加强了革命队伍在毛泽东思想原则基础上的团结，巩固和发展了按车间、按班组的革命大联合和革命三结合，推动了革命和生产的发展。
    正确对待少数后进的群众。在全厂革命步步深入，生产节节上升的大好形势下，有少数职工纪律松弛，革命和生产都搞得不好。怎样对待这些职工？有人主张用行政措施来“卡”他们。但是这个厂的无产阶级革命派认为，这些职工所以后进，主要是对他们的阶级教育没有抓紧，采取“卡”的办法，不能从思想上教育他们。于是，革命派职工在毛泽东思想学习班里，在向一小撮阶级敌人进攻中，注意用本厂、本部门的阶级斗争事实来教育这些职工，并且主动关心他们，信任他们，帮助这些职工提高了阶级觉悟，主动斗了私心，积极投入到阶级斗争和生产斗争中。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派还坚决执行毛主席的干部路线。他们遵照毛主席“要相信百分之九十以上的干部是好的和比较好的。犯了错误的人，大多数是可以改的”教导，对犯了错误甚至犯了严重错误的干部，都采取了“惩前毖后、治病救人”和“一看二帮”的态度。每星期用一定时间，组织他们结合厂内阶级斗争实际，活学活用毛泽东思想，学习伟大领袖毛主席在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，帮助革命干部提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，正确对待群众，正确对待自己，跟上飞跃发展着的新形势。另一方面，充分发挥革命干部的作用，在工作中考察、锻炼、提高他们，并支持他们大胆工作。无产阶级革命派掌权以后，就从上到下建立了由无产阶级革命派代表和干部参加的生产领导班子。一年多来，不管干扰再大，困难再多，这些生产领导班子始终坚持工作，对保证全厂生产的正常进行和不断提高生产水平起了很重要的作用。
