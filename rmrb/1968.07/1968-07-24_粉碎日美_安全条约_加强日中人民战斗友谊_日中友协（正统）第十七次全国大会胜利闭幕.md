The 17th National Congress of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) Concludes Successfully

The congress adopted a declaration and a message of greetings to the Chinese people, enthusiastically praising the Chinese Cultural Revolution as an inspiration for the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world; it emphasized that every victory in the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles of the Japanese people is inseparable from the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought.

BEIJING, July 23 -- A report from Tokyo says that the 17th National Congress of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) concluded successfully on July 21.

This three-day congress was held at a time when the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism is flourishing. The congress demonstrated that the broad masses of the Japanese people who insist on Japan-China friendship, oppose U.S. imperialism, the reactionary Sato government, Soviet modern revisionism, and the revisionist group of the Japanese Communist Party led by Kyuichi Tokuda, are continuously growing and strengthening their fighting forces; it expressed their determination to further strengthen the combat friendship between the peoples of Japan and China, to crush the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," to recover Okinawa, and to carry out the Japan-China friendship movement.

At the meeting on July 21, Kojiro Kuroda, who was elected as the chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), ascended the platform holding the revolutionary treasure "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" and delivered a speech. He pointed out that the urgent task of the Japan-China friendship movement at present is to crush the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." We must combine the struggle against U.S. military bases with the struggle against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries in every factory, rural area, and school. We must continuously expand the anti-U.S. patriotic united front in the struggle and widely and deeply propagate the great Mao Zedong Thought.

Kuraji Yasui, a responsible person from the preparatory committee of the leftist faction of the Tokyo Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, Ichiro Uemura, a responsible person from the "Sanrizuka, Shibayama Alliance Against the Construction of the New Tokyo International Airport," and Fubo Wu, vice-chairman of the Tokyo Chinese Association, were invited to attend and speak. Yasui pointed out in his speech that strengthening the combat friendship between the peoples of Japan and China is the sincere wish of 100 million Japanese people and 700 million Chinese people. This great cause with tremendous vitality cannot be stopped or destroyed by any force. Yasui pointed out that to correctly develop the Japan-China friendship movement, we must have the correct ideology and correct theory as guidance. He said that Mao Zedong Thought has not only been completely proven correct in the storm of the Chinese revolution but has also been proven by the practice of world revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. This congress decided to further carry out the movement to introduce the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and at the same time decided to widely carry out the movement to propagate and apply Mao Zedong Thought. This is a great achievement of this congress.

Uemura, in his speech, thanked the broad membership of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) for supporting the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle of the farmers of Sanrizuka. Uemura said that the farmers' struggle in Sanrizuka is not isolated. Through the struggle, the farmers of Sanrizuka have continuously raised their political consciousness, and they now link their struggle with the anti-U.S. struggle of the peoples of the world.

The congress adopted a declaration. The declaration said: The current world situation is excellent. Under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao Zedong, the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is achieving comprehensive victory, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is inspiring the struggles of the peoples of the world for independence, democracy, peace, and progress. The Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation has achieved great victories. The national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging forward.

The declaration pointed out: U.S. imperialism is now in a desperate situation worldwide.

The declaration also pointed out: In Japan, the struggle against U.S. military bases is raging. The voices of the Japanese people demanding the immediate and unconditional return of Okinawa are echoing throughout Japan.

The declaration strongly condemned the crimes of the running dogs of U.S. imperialism and the reactionary Sato government -- the revisionist group of the Japanese Communist Party led by Kyuichi Tokuda. The declaration said: The revisionist group of the Japanese Communist Party led by Kyuichi Tokuda and Soviet modern revisionism are in collusion, using the banner of "revolution" on the one hand, and playing the role of the anti-China vanguard that the U.S.-Japan reactionaries cannot play on the other. They use the pretext of opposing the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to actually prolong the U.S.-Japan "security system."

The declaration emphasized that crushing the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is an urgent task for achieving Japan-China friendship. The declaration condemned the U.S.-Japan reactionaries for frantically reviving Japanese militarism.

The declaration called on all members to strengthen the combat friendship between the peoples of Japan and China, to carry out colorful friendship activities; to establish powerful organizations in factories, rural areas, regions, and schools; to strive for the crushing of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the recovery of Okinawa, the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and to unite all possible forces to develop a powerful anti-U.S. patriotic united front. The declaration clearly pointed out: The Japan-China friendship movement is an important component of this anti-U.S. patriotic united front.

The declaration expressed the belief that the day of victory for the Japanese people and the peoples of the world is not far off.

The congress also adopted a message of greetings to the Chinese people. The message said: The Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are achieving comprehensive victory in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is our greatest inspiration.

The message said: Every victory we achieve in the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles is inseparable from the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought.

The message said: Chairman Mao said: "The Japanese people are a great people. They will never allow U.S. imperialism to ride on their heads for long." We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings to strive for victory.

The message concluded with the slogans: Long live the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live the combat friendship between the peoples of Japan and China!

The congress adopted the summary of work for 1967 and the future movement guidelines, as well as resolutions on carrying out the struggle for the immediate, unconditional, and complete return of Okinawa.

The congress unanimously elected Kojiro Kuroda as chairman, Takeo Ito, Katsunori Kawase, and Hiroshi Yoshida as vice-chairmen, and elected advisors, standing directors, and directors.

    新华社二十三日讯　东京消息：日中友好协会（正统）第十七次全国大会，二十一日胜利闭幕。
    这次历时三天的大会是在日本人民反美爱国正义斗争蓬勃发展的大好形势下召开的。大会显示了坚持日中友好的广大日本人民，反对美帝国主义、佐藤反动政府、苏联现代修正主义、日共宫本修正主义集团的斗争力量不断发展和壮大；表达了他们要进一步加强日中两国人民的战斗友谊和粉碎日美“安全条约”、收复冲绳、开展日中友好运动的决心。
    在二十一日的会议上，当选为日中友好协会（正统）会长的黑田寿男，手持革命宝书《毛主席语录》走上讲台，发表讲话。他指出，当前日中友好运动的迫切任务是粉碎日美“安全条约”，我们必须把反对美军基地的斗争同各车间、农村、学校的反对美日反动派的斗争结合起来。我们必须在斗争中不断地扩大反美爱国统一战线，并且广泛地深入地宣传伟大的毛泽东思想。
    日本共产党东京都委员会（左派）筹备会负责人安斋库治、“三里塚、芝山反对修建新国际机场同盟”负责人户村一作、东京华侨总会副会长吴普文等人应邀出席并讲了话。安斋在讲话中指出，加强日中两国人民的战斗友谊，是一亿日本人民和七亿中国人民的衷心愿望，这一具有伟大生命力的事业，是任何力量也不能阻挡和抹杀的。安斋指出，要正确地发展日中友好运动，就必须有正确的思想、正确的理论作指导。他说，毛泽东思想不仅在中国革命的风暴中完全证实了它的正确性，而且为世界革命的实践所证实。毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。这一次大会确定要进一步开展介绍中国无产阶级文化大革命的运动，同时确定要广泛地开展宣传毛泽东思想、活学活用毛泽东思想的运动，这是这次大会的巨大成果。
    户村一作在讲话中感谢日中友好协会（正统）组织的广大会员支援三里塚农民的反美爱国斗争。户村说，三里塚的农民斗争不是孤立的，三里塚的农民通过斗争，不断地提高了政治觉悟，他们现在把自己的斗争同世界人民的反美斗争联系起来。
    大会通过一项宣言。宣言说：当前，世界形势大好。史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，在伟大的毛泽东主席领导下，正在夺取全面胜利，中国无产阶级文化大革命鼓舞着全世界人民争取独立、民主、和平和进步的斗争。越南人民的抗美救国战争取得了伟大胜利。亚非拉人民的民族解放斗争，正在波澜壮阔地向前发展。
    宣言指出：美帝国主义现在在全世界范围内陷入了走投无路的窘境。
    宣言还指出：在日本，反对美军基地的斗争烈火正在熊熊燃烧。日本人民要求立即无条件地归还冲绳的呼声响彻日本全国。
    宣言强烈谴责美帝国主义和佐藤反动政府的走狗——宫本修正主义集团的罪行。宣言说：日共宫本修正主义集团和苏联现代修正主义遥相呼应，一面打着
  “革命”的招牌，一面起着美日反动派所不能起的反华急先锋的作用。他们打着反对日美“安全条约”的幌子，实质上在延续日美“安全体制”。
    宣言强调指出，粉碎日美“安全条约”是争取日中友好的迫切任务。宣言谴责美日反动派疯狂地复活日本军国主义。
    宣言号召全体会员加强日中两国人民的战斗友谊，开展丰富多彩的友好活动；在车间、农村、地区、学校建立强大组织；为粉碎日美“安全条约”，收复冲绳，恢复日中邦交，团结一切可以团结的力量，以发展强大的反美爱国统一战线而奋斗。宣言明确指出：日中友好运动就是这一反美爱国统一战线的重要的组成部分。
    宣言表示相信，日本人民和全世界人民获得胜利的日子，已经为期不远了。
    大会还通过了给中国人民的致敬信。信中说：用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，在伟大的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中正在取得全面胜利，这是对我们的最大的鼓舞。
    致敬信说：我们在反帝反修斗争中的每一个胜利，都是同学习和运用毛泽东思想分不开的。
    致敬信说：毛主席说：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”我们一定要遵循毛主席的这一教导，去争取胜利。
    致敬信最后高呼：敬祝伟大领袖毛泽东主席万寿无疆！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利万岁！
    日中两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！
    大会通过了一九六七年度工作总结和今后的运动方针以及关于开展立即无条件全面归还冲绳的斗争等决议。
    大会一致选出黑田寿男为会长，伊藤武雄、川濑一贯、吉田法晴为副会长，并选出了顾问、常任理事、理事等。
