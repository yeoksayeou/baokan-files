In the rugged mountains of Qimen County, Anhui Province, and the surrounding counties, the stories of the Shanghai First Medical College Huashan Hospital medical team's selfless service to the poor and lower-middle peasants are widely circulated. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the mountain areas, with their deep class feelings of loving Chairman Mao, praise this medical team as "doctors sent by Chairman Mao."

Peasant grandmother Zhu Chunxiang is a member of the Lu Li Dajie Tianlang Production Brigade of Cheng'an Commune in Qimen County. This 71-year-old peasant grandmother has been blind (suffering from senile cataracts) for more than a decade. The medical team treated her eye disease, restoring her sight. When the medical team first removed the bandage from her eyes, this peasant grandmother, who had endured countless hardships in the old society, saw Chairman Mao's portrait with her first glimpse and was deeply moved, tears welling up in her eyes. She couldn't help but shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!" She also embraced the medical team members, saying excitedly, "Good doctors, doctors sent by Chairman Mao." The medical team members were also moved and said, "Don't thank us, thank Chairman Mao, thank the Communist Party. It is Chairman Mao's great instructions that guided us here."

Following the Course Charted by Chairman Mao, Marching Forward Bravely

The 23 medical personnel of the medical team are mostly in their twenties. Under the great instructions of Chairman Mao to "shift the focus of medical and health work to rural areas," they arrived in Qimen Mountain Area in June 1967 and have been living and fighting here for eleven months, establishing a deep proletarian bond with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

The medical team members, with their loyal hearts to Chairman Mao, picked up their backpacks and came to the Qimen Mountain Area. They are not only a medical team but first and foremost a propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought, and also a learning team to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants.

After entering the mountain area, the first thing the medical team did was to propagate the great Mao Zedong Thought. To propagate Mao Zedong Thought, they went to the remotest places, no matter how high the mountains or how far the roads. Sometimes they walked dozens of miles of mountain roads to perform in remote production brigades.

The medical team also conducted revolutionary criticism and struggle with the poor and lower-middle peasants. During work breaks, they held field criticism meetings with the poor and lower-middle peasants; sometimes they brought mobile criticism and struggle cartoon columns to the fields. In the evenings, they held joint criticism meetings with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, they used their personal experiences to criticize and denounce the crimes of China's Khrushchev in attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside and the crimes of China's Khrushchev in pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the medical and health sector. The poor and lower-middle peasants' deep class feelings of loving Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought deeply educated the medical team members, further strengthening their resolve and confidence to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants.

They decided to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, to take the road of integrating with workers and peasants, to transform the objective world while transforming the subjective world. In the struggle, in the harsh environment, they genuinely transformed themselves.

Most of them grew up in big cities and had not experienced harsh environments. Suddenly, they found themselves in the mountains, living and working in the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The erroneous thoughts of intellectuals fearing dirt and hard work were exposed. They studied Chairman Mao's works with this problem in mind. Chairman Mao said: "Comparing untransformed intellectuals with workers and peasants, one feels that intellectuals are not clean. The cleanest are still the workers and peasants, even though their hands are black and their feet have cow dung, they are still cleaner than bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals." They used Chairman Mao's instructions to examine and criticize their own thoughts and feelings, to expose and criticize their own shortcomings, and to transform their thoughts. Later, some comrades, while rescuing patients, performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation for several hours with the patients. One comrade, to rescue a child suffering from toxic dysentery, fearlessly and without concern for infection, held a tube in his mouth to suction the child's phlegm.

Just coming down from the city, walking dozens of miles a day felt very tiring. When they climbed steep mountains and crossed rugged terrain, sweat pouring down, extremely fatigued, they would recite Chairman Mao's quotations: "Resolutely carry out the decision, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." "Carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, fearing no sacrifice, fearing no fatigue, and continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." Chairman Mao's teachings gave them boundless energy, inspiring them to march forward bravely. Now, they can walk dozens of miles a day without a problem.

Upon arriving in the Qimen Mountain Area, they heard that there were poisonous snakes and tigers in the deep mountains, and they were initially a bit afraid. How should they correctly treat poisonous snakes and tigers? They studied Chairman Mao's works and realized that fearing tigers and snakes ultimately meant fearing death. Chairman Mao taught: "To struggle is to have sacrifices, and the death of people is a common occurrence. But we think of the people's interests, think of the suffering of the majority of the people, and we die for the people, which is a worthy death." Chairman Mao's teachings gave them boundless strength. They also thought that the poor and lower-middle peasants had been working in the mountains for years and were not afraid of poisonous snakes and fierce tigers, feeling that their own fear of death was shameful. Later, some comrades crossed dozens of miles of mountains in the dark, and some comrades, seeing tiger prints in the snow, still bravely advanced. "What is the greatest fighting spirit? The greatest fighting spirit is the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are brave and fearless of death." They remembered Comrade Lin Biao's teachings, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds and transform themselves. Some comrades said well: "We cured the poor and lower-middle peasants of their physical ailments, and the poor and lower-middle peasants cured us of our ideological ailments."

They grew and tempered themselves in the struggle, in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, continuously promoting ideological transformation. There was a surgeon in the medical team who worked in the mountains for three months despite being ill, shouldering the busy surgical work. Just when the work was extremely tense, he contracted hepatitis, but he still insisted on climbing mountains and crossing rivers to provide medical treatment and medicine to the poor and lower-middle peasants. To rescue a woman in labor, he walked dozens of miles, enduring liver pain to cross the 1,500-meter-high Dachi Ridge, forgetting himself for the patient. Comrades and local poor and lower-middle peasants all advised him to rest well, but he always said: "I'm fine, the patient is important." His spirit of putting the people's interests and revolutionary interests first came from the great Mao Zedong Thought, came from his deep class feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Completely and Thoroughly Serving the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

The great leader Chairman Mao has always been concerned about the health of the poor and lower-middle peasants and has consistently instructed medical workers to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The medical team members regard whether they completely and thoroughly serve the poor and lower-middle peasants as an important measure of whether they are loyal to Chairman Mao.

One evening in February, a peasant in Lijiao Commune's Zhengchong Brigade suddenly had a relapse of an old illness, vomiting half a basin of blood, and the condition was very critical. The medical team members thought of Chairman Mao's teachings on "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, carrying forward the spirit of saving lives and rescuing the injured of Comrade Norman Bethune, and decided to perform an emergency operation to save the patient. The patient had lost too much blood and was in severe shock, needing an immediate blood transfusion. At this critical moment, the medical team members eagerly extended their arms, hoping to inject their own fresh blood into the veins of their class brothers. Some comrades had just donated blood to the poor and lower-middle peasants not long ago, and some comrades were not in good health, but they thought of Chairman Mao's teachings and the scene of Comrade Norman Bethune donating blood to the Eighth Route Army, and they sincerely requested: "Take my blood!" This time, five comrades in the medical team with the same blood type as the patient all donated blood.

To achieve "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the poor and lower-middle peasants, one must learn from Comrade Norman Bethune's extreme sense of responsibility to work and extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people. The story of a bowl of pickled vegetables in the medical team is a vivid example of everyone seriously learning from Comrade Norman Bethune.

In Lijiao Commune's Shiji Brigade, there was an over-70-year-old peasant grandmother whose right index finger had a festering boil, red and swollen. Two comrades from the medical team, during a mobile medical visit, operated on her to drain the pus and asked her to come to the Lijiao Hospital, where the medical team was stationed, to change the dressing every other day or have the brigade's health worker change it. From Shiji Brigade to Lijiao, one had to walk fifteen miles of mountain roads and cross a very high and steep mountain. The old grandmother was old and had difficulty crossing the mountain, so she did not go to change the dressing but used some herbal medicine to apply to it. More than ten days later, when two comrades from the medical team went to see her again, the old grandmother's hand was even more swollen. That night, they studied Chairman Mao's quotations on serving the people with this problem in mind, using the two "completely" and "thoroughly" and the two "extremes" as a measure of their work, feeling that they had not truly considered the old peasant grandmother's difficulties, asking her to run so many mountain roads every other day was difficult, and asking the brigade's health worker to change the dressing had not been implemented, not achieving completely and thoroughly serving the people. Therefore, they sent two more comrades to operate on the old grandmother to drain the pus again and stayed in the production brigade, changing the old grandmother's dressing every day. They also taught the brigade's health worker the method of changing the dressing. In this way, after staying for a few days, the old grandmother's condition improved, and the medical team comrades changed to visiting her every other day, finally completely curing the old grandmother's hand. The old grandmother was very grateful and had someone send a bowl of pickled vegetables, a local delicacy loved by the poor and lower-middle peasants. The gift was light, but the sentiment was heavy, expressing her deep feelings for the medical team.

According to incomplete statistics, the medical team saved more than ninety critically ill patients in Qimen County over eleven months, performed surgery on more than five hundred poor and lower-middle peasants, and treated more than five thousand poor and lower-middle peasants.

In the vast countryside, carrying out creative work

Through eleven months of practice, the comrades of the Huashan Hospital medical team further understood the great significance of Chairman Mao's instructions on health work. They carried out creative work in the countryside according to Chairman Mao's instructions and began to explore some experiences in serving the poor and lower-middle peasants in the mountain areas.

They deeply felt that the examination and treatment methods in the hospital are completely unsuitable for the countryside. The method of cultivating doctors is also only for the cities. They decided to break away from the revisionist system and contribute to the establishment of a new medical and health system suitable for the countryside. The mountain area's transportation is inconvenient, and if they encounter some diseases they cannot treat during mobile medical visits, time will take away the lives of their class brothers. They implemented medical and nursing integration, one specialty with multiple abilities, and integrated traditional and Western medicine, focusing their work on treating and researching common and frequently occurring diseases in the countryside. Now, nurses can perform appendectomies, hernia repairs, and other common surgeries in the mountains, can deliver difficult births, and even pharmacists can treat common and frequently occurring diseases. Every medical team member has learned to pull teeth.

The conditions in the mountains are poor, so they made various simple instruments themselves, using wooden boards to make simple operating tables and saline stands, and even modifying air pumps into suction devices. During mountain surgeries, they used wooden boards and tables as operating tables, hung sheets as tops, and used flashlights as surgical lamps.

Under the harsh conditions of the mountains, they firmly believed in the primacy of human factors, fully mobilizing their subjective initiative and creativity, utilizing all available conditions, and creating all kinds of conditions to overcome difficulties and carry out the strictest disinfection. In more than five hundred major and minor surgeries, the infection rate was only 3.2%, lower than some large hospitals in the cities.

To better serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, the medical team trained health workers in each production brigade they visited. They selected young people from the poor and lower-middle peasants who were good in thought and labor as objects for cultivating health workers.

The Huashan Hospital medical team served the poor and lower-middle peasants wholeheartedly in the Qimen Mountain Area for eleven months. The most fundamental reason was their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's great instructions and their resolute implementation of them. In mid-May, after successfully completing their mission and returning to Shanghai, they proposed the revolutionary initiative to organize a new medical team to go to the mountains. They swore to the most respected great leader Chairman Mao: Follow the great leader Chairman Mao closely, revolutionize to the end without turning back, take root in the countryside to make revolution, and serve the poor and lower-middle peasants for life!

### “毛主席派来的好医生”——记战斗在皖南山区的上海华山医院医疗小分队

    “毛主席派来的好医生”
    ——记战斗在皖南山区的上海华山医院医疗小分队
    在安徽省祁门县的崇山峻岭以及附近几个县的广大贫下中农中，传诵着上海第一医学院华山医院医疗小分队全心全意为贫下中农服务的动人故事。山区广大贫下中农以无限热爱毛主席的深厚阶级感情，称赞这支医疗队是“毛主席派来的好医生”。
    贫农老妈妈朱春香是祁门县城安公社卢荔大队天琅?生产队的社员。这位七十一岁的老妈妈双目失明（患老年性白内障）已经十多年了。医疗队同志给她治好了眼病，使她重见光明。当医疗队的同志第一次把覆盖在她眼睛上的纱布拿去时，这位在旧社会历尽千辛万苦的贫农老妈妈，一眼就看到了毛主席像，心情万分激动，热泪盈眶，不由得高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”她还双手抱住医疗队的同志，非常激动地说：“好医生，毛主席派来的好医生。”医疗队的同志也激动地说：“不要谢我们，应该谢毛主席，谢共产党，是毛主席的伟大指示指引着我们来的。”
      沿着毛主席指引的航向奋勇前进
    医疗小分队的二十三位医务人员，多数是二十多岁的青年人。他们在伟大领袖毛主席提出的“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的伟大指示指引下，一九六七年六月到达祁门山区，在这里生活、战斗了十一个月，同广大贫下中农建立了血肉相连的深厚的无产阶级感情。
    医疗小分队的同志怀着对毛主席的赤胆忠心，背起背包，来到了祁门山区。他们不单是一支医疗队，而且首先是一支毛泽东思想宣传队，也是向贫下中农学习的学习队。
    医疗队进入山区以后，第一件事就是宣传伟大的毛泽东思想。为了宣传毛泽东思想，他们不管山高路远，越是边远的地方越是要去。有时他们步行几十里山路，到边远的生产大队演出。
    医疗队还和贫下中农一起搞革命大批判。劳动间隙，他们和贫下中农一起举行田头批判会，有时把流动的大批判漫画专栏带到田头去；晚上，他们和贫下中农联合召开批判大会。他们和贫下中农一起，各自用自己的切身感受，批判和控诉中国赫鲁晓夫妄图在农村复辟资本主义的罪行，批判和控诉中国赫鲁晓夫在医疗卫生部门推行反革命修正主义路线的罪行。贫下中农无限热爱毛主席和毛泽东思想的深厚阶级感情，深深地教育了医疗队的同志，更加坚定了他们为贫下中农服务的决心和信心。
    他们决心向贫下中农学习，走与工农相结合的道路，在改造客观世界的同时改造主观世界。在斗争中，在艰苦的环境中，切切实实地改造自己。
    他们绝大多数生长在大城市，没有经过艰苦环境的锻炼。一下子到了山区，吃住在贫下中农家里，知识分子怕脏怕累的一些错误思想就暴露出来了。他们就带着这一问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“拿未曾改造的知识分子和工人农民比较，就觉得知识分子不干净了，最干净的还是工人农民，尽管他们手是黑的，脚上有牛屎，还是比资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子都干净。”他们用毛主席的指示来对照检查自己的思想感情，亮私斗私，改造思想。以后，有的同志在抢救病人时，与病人连续几小时对口呼吸，有一位同志为了抢救一个患中毒性菌痢的孩子，不怕脏，不怕传染病，嘴里咬着导管给病人吸痰。
    刚从城市里下去，一天走几十里山路，感到很累。当他们翻峻岭、越陡坡，汗水淋淋，十分疲惫的时候，他们就朗诵毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”毛主席的教导，使他们浑身是劲，鼓舞着他们奋勇前进。现在他们一天跑几十里山路不在话下。
    到了祁门山区，听说深山里有毒蛇，有虎豹，他们开始有些害怕。如何正确对待毒蛇和虎豹呢？他们学习了毛主席著作，认识到，怕虎怕蛇，归根到底是怕死。毛主席教导说：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”毛主席的教导使他们浑身增添了无穷的力量。他们又想到，贫下中农成年累月在山区劳动，并不害怕毒蛇和猛虎，感到自己这种怕死的思想是可耻的。以后，有的同志摸黑翻过了几十里的大山，有的同志看到雪地里老虎的脚印，还是勇敢地前进。“什么是最大的战斗力？最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是勇敢，不怕死。”他们牢记林副主席的教导，以毛泽东思想来武装自己的头脑，改造自己。有的同志说得好：“我们为贫下中农治好了身体上的病，而贫下中农为我们治了思想上的病。”
    他们在战斗中锻炼成长，在毛泽东思想学习班里斗私批修，不断促进思想革命化。医疗队里有个外科医生，在山区带病工作了三个月，担负着繁忙的手术工作。正当工作十分紧张的时候，他患了肝病，但他仍然坚持翻山越岭，为贫下中农送医送药上门。为了抢救一个难产病人，他步行几十里，忍着肝痛翻过一千五百米高的大赤岭，为病人忘记了自己。同志们和当地贫下中农都劝他好好休息，他总是说：“我不要紧，病人要紧。”他这种以人民的利益、以革命利益为第一生命的精神，来自伟大的毛泽东思想，来自对贫下中农深厚的阶级感情。
    完全、彻底为贫下中农服务
    伟大领袖毛主席最关心贫下中农的健康，一贯指示医务工作者要为工农兵服务。医疗小分队的同志把是否完全、彻底为贫下中农服务，作为衡量自己是否忠于毛主席的一个重要标志。
    今年二月的一天晚上，历口公社正冲大队一位贫农突然旧病复发，呕泻了半马桶血水，病情十分危急。医疗小分队的同志想到毛主席“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的教导，发扬白求恩同志救死扶伤的革命精神，决定立即进行手术抢救。病人失血过多，严重休克，需要马上输血。在这危急的时刻，医疗队的同志争先恐后地把胳膊伸出来，希望能把自己的鲜血注入阶级兄弟的血管里。有的同志在不久前刚为贫下中农献过血，有的同志身体并不好，但他们想到毛主席的教导，想到白求恩同志为八路军输血的情景，就无比恳切地要求：“抽我的血！”这一次，医疗队五位与病人血型相同的同志都献了血。
    要做到“完全”、“彻底”为贫下中农服务，就要学习白求恩同志对工作的极端负责任和对同志对人民的极端热忱。医疗队里流传的一碗酸菜的故事，就是大家认真学习白求恩同志的一个写照。
    历口公社石迹大队有个七十多岁的贫农老妈妈，右手食指上生了个疮，红肿化脓。医疗队有两个同志去巡回医疗时，替她开刀排了脓，并要她隔天到医疗队所在的历口医院去换药或请生产大队的卫生员换药。从石迹大队到历口，要走十五里山路，翻过一座又高又陡的山。老妈妈年纪大，翻山有困难，她没有去换药，自己用一点草药敷着。十多天后，医疗队有两个同志再去看她时，老妈妈的手肿得更厉害了。这天晚上，他们带着这一问题，学习了毛主席有关为人民服务的语录，用“完全”、“彻底”和两个“极端”这两把尺子来衡量自己的工作，觉得没有设身处地为贫农老妈妈着想，叫她隔天跑那么多山路是有困难的，叫生产大队卫生员换药，也没有落实，没有做到完全、彻底为人民服务。于是，他们又派两个同志再去替老妈妈开刀排脓，并住在生产队里，每天替老妈妈换药，他们还把换药的方法教给大队卫生员。这样，住了几天，老妈妈的病情好转了，医疗队的同志又改为隔天去看她一次，终于把老妈妈的手完全治好了。老妈妈非常感激，托人送来一碗当地贫下中农最喜爱的酸菜。礼轻情意重，表达了她对医疗队的深厚感情。
    据不完全统计，医疗队在祁门县十一个月的时间里，前后共抢救了九十多名危急病人，为五百多名贫下中农施行了手术，给五千多名贫下中农治了病。
    在农村广阔的天地里进行创造性的工作
    通过十一个月的实践，华山医院医疗小分队的同志进一步理解了毛主席对卫生工作指示的伟大意义。他们根据毛主席的指示，在农村进行创造性的工作，开始摸索出一些为山区贫下中农服务的经验。
    他们深深地感到：现在医院那套检查和治疗方法，根本不适合农村。培养医生的方法也只是为了城市。他们决心打破修正主义的一套，为建立新的适合于农村的医疗卫生制度贡献力量。山区交通不便，如果在巡回时碰到有些疾病不会治疗，时间就会夺去阶级兄弟的生命。他们就实行医护合一，一专多能，中西医结合，并且把工作重点放在治疗和研究农村常见病、多发病上。现在，护士都能做阑尾、疝气等山区常见病手术，能够接难产，连药剂师也能治疗常见病、多发病。每个医疗队员都学会了拔牙。
    山区条件差，他们自己制造各种简陋的器械，用木板制成了简易手术台、盐水架，甚至用打气筒改装成吸引器。在手术进山时，就用木板、桌子当手术台，用被单吊顶，用手电筒代替无影灯。
    在山区艰苦的条件下，他们坚信人的因素第一，充分发挥了主观能动性、创造性，利用一切可以利用的条件，千方百计创造种种条件，克服困难，进行最严格的消毒。在五百多例大小手术中，感染率仅百分之三点二，比城市有些大医院还要低。
    为了更好地为贫下中农服务，医疗队每到一个地方就培训生产大队卫生员。他们挑选贫下中农出身的思想好、劳动好的青年，作为培养卫生员的对象。
                        ×　×　×
    华山医院医疗小分队十一个月在祁门山区全心全意为贫下中农服务，最根本的一条是对毛主席的伟大指示无限忠诚，坚决照办。五月中旬，他们胜利完成任务回到上海以后，又提出了组织新的医疗队去山区的革命倡议。他们向最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席宣誓：紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，革命到底不回头，扎根农村闹革命，为贫下中农服务一辈子！　（据新华社上海电）
