	Advancing Along the Revolutionary Course Opened by Chairman Mao
	North Sea Fleet, Certain Unit Observation and Communication Station

	Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing have always opposed emphasizing proletarian politics. Luo Ruiqing shouted, "For units on duty, ... the main task is training," "If military training is not done well, ... when it comes to war, it will lead to the destruction of the party and the country." He tirelessly peddled the black goods of "technology first" and "military first."

	Good military training is one of the components of the Four Good movements. For the troops, conducting good military training is very important for preparing for war. However, how should we prepare for war? Should we emphasize military matters or proletarian politics? Here lies the struggle between two lines.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Mastering ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole party to wage great political struggles. If this task is not solved, the party's political tasks cannot be completed." We believe that we must, on the premise of emphasizing proletarian politics, do a good job in preparing for war. Using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, we must firmly grasp political and ideological work, promote the ideological transformation of people, forge an unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, and raise the awareness of the line struggle among cadres and soldiers. Only in this way can we do a good job in preparing for war and successfully complete the glorious task of defending Chairman Mao and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Our observation and communication station is located in an area with a severe shortage of fresh water, with winds blowing throughout the year. In the summer, the ground is damp and foggy, making it difficult to breathe. The party branch, in response to this situation, first emphasized politics, repeatedly educating cadres and soldiers to be unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao, and to carry forward the spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong, guarding and building the island, and being good "thousand-mile eyes" to defend Chairman Mao. Last year, the political instructor Zhao Qicheng brought back a handful of "Beijing soil" from Tiananmen Square and scattered it on the top of our station, educating cadres and soldiers: "Standing on the soil of Tiananmen Square, looking at the world with a firmer resolve, swearing to see the red flag flying all over the world."

	During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we repeatedly organized the troops to study Chairman Mao's theories, lines, principles, and policies on continuing the revolution under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, strengthening the awareness of the enemy, and continuously raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines. Comrades understand: only by seeing clearly in the struggle between the two lines can one see clearly on the fluorescent screen; only by being good sentinels defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line can one be good "thousand-mile eyes" in preparing for war. Once, a lighthouse gear broke down and could not rotate, and there were no spare parts for preparation. What to do? The direction-finding soldiers and the oil machine soldiers, in order to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, used manpower to push, always maintaining the lighthouse's light. To improve the radar, we studied Chairman Mao's teaching, "Our responsibility is to the people," carried out technological innovations, and effectively completed the task of preparing for war. The achievements we have made are the best refutation of Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing's opposition to emphasizing proletarian politics and advocating the fallacy of "military first."

	Our observation and communication station firmly implements Chairman Mao's military line and the principles and policies of Comrade Lin Biao's political construction of the military, and has been rated as a Four Good station for six consecutive years. The facts tell us: emphasizing proletarian politics makes everything red, emphasizing military matters makes everything empty. We must deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism and struggle, and forever advance along the revolutionary course opened by Chairman Mao!

    沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道前进
    北海舰队　某部观通站
    中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿一贯反对突出无产阶级政治。罗瑞卿叫嚷什么：“搞值班的部队，……主要搞训练”，“军事训练搞不好，……打起仗来，就要亡党亡国。”他竭力贩卖“技术第一”、“军事第一”的黑货。
    军事训练好是四好运动的一项内容。对部队来说，把军事训练搞好，对于搞好战备工作是很重要的。但是，怎样搞好战备呢？是突出军事，还是突出无产阶级政治，这里存在着两条路线的斗争。
    毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”我们认为，必须在突出无产阶级政治的前提下，去搞好战备。以毛泽东思想为武器，狠抓政治思想工作，搞好人的思想革命化，锤炼对毛主席的无限忠心，把干部战士的路线斗争觉悟提得高高的，这样，才能搞好战备，胜利完成保卫毛主席，保卫无产阶级文化大革命的光荣任务。
    我们观通站，驻地淡水奇缺，一年四季刮风。夏天地潮雾多，心头闷得喘不过气。党支部针对这种情况，首先抓政治，反复教育干部战士无限忠于毛主席，发扬愚公移山的精神，守岛建岛，当好保卫毛主席的“千里眼”。去年，指导员赵企成同志，从天安门前带回了一把“北京土”，撒在我们驻地的山顶上，教育干部战士：身站天安门前土，放眼世界志更坚，誓看全球红旗都插遍。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们反复组织部队学习毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，加强敌情观念，不断提高两条路线斗争的觉悟。同志们懂得：只有在两条路线斗争中看得清，才能在荧光屏上看得清；只有当好保卫毛主席革命路线的哨兵，才能在战备中当好“千里眼”。有一次，灯塔坏了一个齿轮，不能转动，又没有战备品。怎么办？指向标兵和油机兵的同志们为了保卫无产阶级文化大革命，就用人力推，始终保持着灯塔发光。为了改进雷达，我们学习毛主席“我们的责任，是向人民负责”的教导，开展技术革新，有效地完成了战备观察任务。我们所取得的成绩，是给中国赫鲁晓夫及反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿反对突出无产阶级政治，鼓吹“军事第一”谬论的一个最好的回击。
    我们观通站，坚决贯彻毛主席建军路线以及林副主席提出的政治建军的方针原则，连续六年被评为四好站。事实告诉我们：突出无产阶级政治样样红，突出军事样样空。我们一定要深入地持久地开展革命大批判，永远沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道前进！
