    The Great Chen Disaster
    --Investigation Report by the Chinese Red Cross on the Crimes Committed by the Chiang Kai-shek Army, Under the Direction and Cover of the United States, When Withdrawing from Dachen and Other Islands
     April 7, 1955, Beijing

    Foreword

    On February 5, 1955, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered the U.S. Seventh Fleet and other U.S. forces to cover the withdrawal of Chiang Kai-shek's troops from Dachen and other islands, and to evacuate the residents of Dachen and other islands to Taiwan. Subsequently, the U.S. military authorities, mainly the Seventh Fleet, mobilized 132 ships, more than 500 aircraft, 45,000 naval personnel, and 3,000 air force personnel to participate in this operation.

    Important U.S. government officials, such as U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Pride, U.S. Ambassador to Taiwan Rankin, U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group Chief to Taiwan Chase, and U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Sabin, visited Dachen Island successively to inspect, deploy, and supervise the evacuation work.

    The Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched on the Dachen, Yushan, Pishan, and other islands off the eastern coast of Zhejiang, with the assistance of the U.S. military, completely withdrew on February 12. They also abducted more than 18,000 residents from these islands. From February 14 to 25, under the direction of the U.S. government, the Chiang Kai-shek troops, while withdrawing from the Nanji Island off the southern coast of Zhejiang, abducted all of the island's more than 2,000 residents.

    On February 13 and 26, 1955, the Chinese People's Liberation Army landed on Dachen, Yushan, Pishan, Nanji, and other islands. Fifty-nine residents, rescued by the Chinese People's Liberation Army from being imprisoned by the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Yangqi Island and Pingfeng Mountain near Dachen Island, angrily denounced that the more than 20,000 peaceful residents of Dachen and other islands were forcibly removed from their homes under the brutal violence of the U.S. military and the Chiang Kai-shek troops. The U.S. military and the Chiang Kai-shek troops also ruthlessly burned and destroyed the houses and property that the residents of Dachen and other islands had painstakingly built and accumulated, making them homeless. These 59 people are:

    Nineteen residents of Dachen Island, innocently imprisoned by the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Yangqi Island, including Wang Shoujian, Lin Ziqing, Wang Qichang, Wang Xianghua, Yan Chuting, Lin Mingyao, Chen Sanmei, Xie Baoxian, Wu Shixiao, Wang Mengzheng, Jia Wu’s wife, Zheng Kaimei, Ye Jianlin, Wang Yicai, Su Binglin, Hong Chen, Chen Zhengyi (including a child of over one year old).

    Twenty-one former Chiang Kai-shek soldiers from Dachen Island, whose families were released by the Chinese People's Liberation Army: Chen Zhiyi, Zhuge Hua, Zhao Sheng, Hu Aying, Wang Zhiping, Zeng Tingpeng, Zhu Guoguang, etc. After being captured by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the Yijiangshan Island battle and released, they were imprisoned by the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Yangqi Island and Pingfeng Mountain.

    Sixteen fishermen from coastal areas of Zhejiang Province, forcibly abducted and imprisoned by the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Yangqi Island: Fang Xianyue, Chen Qihe, Chen Qiucai, Chen Qiwu, Liu Fugen, etc.

    In addition, there are two residents left on Dachen Island when the Chiang Kai-shek troops withdrew from Dachen Island: one is an elderly man, Kong Jiangbo, who was critically ill, and has now recovered his health after being treated by medical personnel of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; the other is a madman with a completely deranged mind, Luo Xiaofan. There is also Lu Xiaohua, a cook of the Chiang Kai-shek troops, who was hiding in a cave on Pishan Island when the Chiang Kai-shek troops withdrew from Pishan Island.

    After learning of this allegation of mass abduction, the Chinese Red Cross, in order to uphold the principles of humanitarianism, organized a Chinese Red Cross investigation team, which from March 3 to 22, 1955, went to Dachen, Yushan, Pishan, Nanji, and other islands and nearby islets to conduct on-site investigations into the crimes committed by the Chiang Kai-shek troops under the direction of the U.S. government and the cover of the U.S. military, and to express condolences and provide relief to the affected residents. The following 51 people accompanied the investigation team:

    Nineteen fishermen who lived on Dachen and other islands and escaped to survive before the Chiang Kai-shek troops withdrew: Ye Yongcha, Qian Xingming, Dong Wenle, Zheng Axian, Wang Sihan, Mei Agen, etc.

    Nine family members of fishermen from coastal areas of Zhejiang Province who were forcibly abducted to Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek troops: Li Huoyuan, Li Liangyan, etc.

    Xie Jiaju, a staff officer of a naval unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; Chen Yukun, deputy company commander of an engineering unit of an army unit; Wu Xiangyun, platoon leader of an engineering unit; Hao Huatai, reconnaissance platoon leader; and soldiers Ying Guankui, Jin Jirong, and Luo Xianfang, 23 in total.

    During the investigation, the investigation team visited all witnesses who had witnessed this atrocity, collected physical evidence that the Chiang Kai-shek troops had not completely destroyed, recorded important testimonies, and filmed and photographed the damage. After detailed investigation and repeated verification, the investigation team confirmed that the aforementioned allegations that the U.S. military and the Chiang Kai-shek troops had forcibly abducted all the residents of Dachen and other islands were a fact with conclusive and undeniable evidence.

    The results of this investigation are now announced to the Chinese people and the people of the world.

    (1) Abduction of Residents

    During the investigation, the investigation team found that the Chiang Kai-shek's military and political organs repeatedly used military and administrative orders to achieve their heinous purpose of abducting more than 20,000 residents of Dachen and other islands, without giving the local people any choice.

    The investigation team found some burnt documents in the rubble of the Chiang Kai-shek's Dachen District Administrative Inspectorate Commissioner's Office. One of them was a telegram sent by Peng Mengji, acting chief of staff of the Chiang Kai-shek army in Taiwan. From this half-burnt piece of paper, the investigation team saw the following words: "×× can be evacuated to Taiwan in its entirety. It is heard that there are several people in Dachen who are seriously ill and elderly, and it is difficult to transport them to Taiwan. According to the President's instructions, all difficulties should be overcome, and if necessary, they should be carried on stretchers onto the ships and must be transported to Taiwan. Please comply. Peng. .02.07
　.15.40"
   (Investigation team note: The characters ×× are illegible)

    The investigation team members also saw the following words on a "Letter to the People" from the Chiang Kai-shek army's Dachen unit commander that was picked up: "President Chiang...specially orders the residents of this island to go to Taiwan. This headquarters is ordered to execute."

    The investigation team confirmed from the following facts that the residents of Dachen and other islands were unwilling to comply with this order that forced them to leave their homes. The investigation team learned from the former residents of Dachen Island who were imprisoned on Yangqi Island that after the residents of Dachen Island heard the order from Chiang Kai-shek to abduct residents, great anxiety arose. Wang Shoujian, an old fisherman from Huangfu Reef, said: "At first, the neighborhood chief Wang Sanyu asked me to take my ID card to the police station to register. I replied: I am not going to Taiwan. I have houses, mountains, and small boats in Dachen, and I can fish and farm. If I go to Taiwan, I will have no place to live, no land to cultivate, and I cannot fish. It's a dead end." Wang Shoujian said: "When the more than one hundred fishing families in Huangfu Reef heard that we were going to Taiwan, every family was crying. My second daughter, Wang Xiangjiao, married in Daxiaopu. When she came home, she said to me that none of the more than two hundred families in Daxiaopu were willing to go."

    On Nanji Island, the investigation team picked up two Chiang Kai-shek army diaries from the pile of waste paper. Both diaries recorded the residents' unwillingness to go to Taiwan. Judging from the matters recorded, one of them seemed to be written by a deputy squad leader. In his diary on February 11, he wrote: "...When the common people heard that they were going to Taiwan, every family was panicked, some crying. Most of the people were unwilling to go to Taiwan. They all said that home was good, and they all had a bitter look. When we saw them, we felt very sad in our hearts, and there was nothing we could do..." Another diary seemed to be written by a messenger. In his diary on February 14, he wrote: "...I went to Sanpanwei to deliver a message and saw some old people crying. Some old people, who were too old, were notified by the village chief to gather at Da Shan × (one character unclear) immediately and bring their luggage. But they were all unhappy to go." In his diary on February 15, he wrote: "...This time, the common people were very reluctant to leave this place, because the common people here live by fishing. If they go to Taiwan, they will feel sad!" (Investigation team note: Some of the punctuation and the words in brackets in the diary were added by us.)

    Wang Shoujian, Wang Xianghua, Lin Mingyao and other residents of Dachen Island, who were imprisoned on Yangqi Island, and Lu Xiaohua, a former cook of the Chiang Kai-shek army on Pishan Island, all testified to the investigation team that in order to abduct the residents of Dachen and other islands to Taiwan, the U.S. government and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, in addition to issuing orders, also adopted strict control and armed threats, among other violent means. The facts are as follows:

    The Chiang Kai-shek's Dachen District Administrative Inspectorate Commissioner's Office, based on the original Baojia organization that ruled the people of Dachen and other islands, built a so-called "evacuation organization" to control all the residents within this organization from top to bottom. In late January, the "Dachen District People's Evacuation Command" was established in the Dachen District (including Dachen, Yushan, Pishan, and other islands), with Shen Zhiyue, the administrative inspector of the Chiang Kai-shek's Dachen District, as the commander-in-chief. Each of the two townships and one town on Dachen Island established an "evacuation" general team, each Bao as an "evacuation" brigade, three or four Lins (Lin is Jia) as an "evacuation" company, and each Lin as an "evacuation" platoon, with three or four resident households forming an "evacuation" group within each Lin. The township chief, town chief, Bao chief, and Lin chief served as the general captain, brigade captain, company captain, and platoon captain, respectively.

    The Chiang Kai-shek's Dachen District Administrative Inspectorate Commissioner's Office and the Wenling County Government sent people to supervise and monitor the town chief, township chief, Bao chief, Bao instructor, Lin chief, etc., in their work of coercing residents to go to Taiwan. Wang Shoujian said: "Wang Xiaomei, the Bao chief of Huangfu Reef, is my own nephew. During the period when the Kuomintang forced the common people to go to Taiwan, I saw him often being called to the county government to attend meetings, and he would sigh when he came back. Once he said to me: You have to go, otherwise they will cut off my head!"

    The Chiang Kai-shek's Dachen District Administrative Inspectorate Commissioner's Office also adopted the method of forcibly registering and issuing "evacuation" certificates to force the residents of Dachen and other islands to go to Taiwan. Lin Mingyao said that around January 20, the Wenling County Government notified: "Those who voluntarily evacuate can register at the police station" and receive an "evacuation" certificate. This method did not work. On January 27, the Wenling County Government suddenly notified that the names of residents would be registered and reported by each Bao. The Bao immediately asked each Lin chief to collect the ID cards of each household and prepare a complete roster. The Lin chief then notified each household: "I have reported your names." On January 29, the "evacuation" certificate was issued to Chenggong Town. It was a white cloth strip one inch wide and three inches long. The number was written on the upper edge of the cloth strip, and the name was written below, with a seal affixed. The "evacuation" certificate was filled in with the name by each Bao chief based on the roster that had been prepared, and then issued to each resident household. It was stipulated that whether old, weak, women, or children, everyone had to wear it on their body. Wang Mengzheng, Wang Qichang, Wang Shoujian, Wang Xianghua, Su Binglin, Wu Shixiao, and Kong Jiangbo all confirmed that the Chiang Kai-shek's military and political personnel forced the residents to wear "evacuation" certificates. The Lin chief told them: "Now that the evacuation certificate has been issued, you have to go!" Su Binglin remembered that his "evacuation" certificate number was 408.

      The investigation team picked up a "Pingyang County People's Evacuation to Taiwan Roster" in the ruins of the Chiang Kai-shek's Pingyang County Government on Nanji Island. It recorded the names, ages, genders, and numbers of all residents of Nanji Island, and was attached with photos of each resident. Qian Xingming, a resident who escaped from Nanji Island before the Chiang Kai-shek troops withdrew, told the investigation team: "This is the 'death register.' If someone refuses to go to Taiwan, the Kuomintang will use the number on this to track down his entire family and the other two households of the 'three-household joint guarantee.'" According to the facts stated by Lin Mingyao and others, the investigation team learned that:

  The "three-household joint guarantee" was a tyrannical method used by the Chiang Kai-shek's military and political organs to rule the residents of Dachen and other islands. The method was to have three resident families provide mutual joint guarantees, and if one family was "guilty," the other two households would be jointly liable. The investigation team found a torn "Joint Guarantee Certificate" in the Chenggong Town Government of Chiang Kai-shek. On the remaining half of the paper, there were phrases such as "Joint guarantors shall closely monitor each other," and the back of the paper was printed with penalty regulations for joint guarantors, including "...life imprisonment, imprisonment for ten years or more," etc. The three resident families of the Seventh Lin of Hepingli, Lin Xie's wife, Feng Jinchang, and Tao Fengxiang, signed and fingerprinted on this "Joint Guarantee Certificate." Wang Xianghua, Wang Shoujian, and others told the investigation team that we common people were most afraid of the "joint guarantee certificate," and the Bao chief told us: "Three families guarantee one family, and you have to go to Taiwan!"

    Wang Shoujian and others also complained to the investigation team about the concentration of fishermen's boats by the Chiang Kai-shek's military and political personnel. All fishing boats on Dachen Island were concentrated before January 30. Wang Qichang, a fisherman from Huangfu Reef, said: "On January 23, the Kuomintang forced me to punt my fishing boat to Langtongmen, and asked people to pull the boat ashore. I saw that the fishing boats of Huangfu Reef were also concentrated there. In this way, surrounded by the sea, we could not escape." The investigation team saw 39 fishing boats stranded on the shore at the Daxiaopu port on Dachen Island. At the beach of Langtongmen, we saw another 27 fishing boats stranded there. The investigation team observed that landmines were buried in the above two places where fishing boats were concentrated, and barbed wire was also laid.

    Lin Mingyao and others mentioned that on the afternoon of the day the "evacuation" certificate was issued, Yu Cetong, the military section chief of the Wenling County Government of Chiang Kai-shek, gathered people above the level of Lin chief in Chenggong Town at the navy parade ground to give a speech, stipulating the gathering locations, wharves, and routes for residents to board the ships. The investigation team picked up a "Dachen People's Evacuation Command's Key Points Map of Gathering of Various Teams" in the ruins of the Dachen District Administrative Inspectorate Commissioner's Office of Chiang Kai-shek. The map marked the gathering locations, boarding routes, and wharves for each team of abducted residents. The investigation team arrived at the navy parade ground, Nantian, the hospital, and other gathering locations for residents according to the map, and walked towards the wharf according to the boarding routes shown on the map. The investigation team found that these roads were very narrow, some were small paths along the coast, and some were small paths in the mountains; and not far from these small paths, there were highways leading to the wharf. The investigation team did not understand why the Dachen District Administrative Inspectorate Commissioner's Office wanted more than 10,000 residents to take such small paths instead of going to the wharf from the highways. Su Binglin said: "The road is narrow, so the Kuomintang can easily monitor the common people and prevent them from escaping."

    The investigation team also found a "Unified Propaganda Instructions for Evacuating the People by the Dachen People's Evacuation Command." This "instruction" required its personnel at all levels to "immediately publicize to all households under their jurisdiction according to the instructions." One item of "propaganda" was: "Evacuating to Taiwan is a rare opportunity. Everyone should be happy and joyful when evacuating, and absolutely should not worry, cry, or shout." Another "People's Evacuation Travel Rules" also had such words: "Arriving in Taiwan, be happy and cheer and thank the welcoming personnel."

    According to Wang Xianghua, when the residents of Huangfu Reef were crying and unwilling to go to Taiwan, Zhu Zhuangfu, the Bao instructor, summoned the residents of Huangfu Reef to a meeting. Zhu Zhuangfu said: "When the Communist Party comes, they will kill all the people of Dachen!" He also said: "The U.S. Seventh Fleet is coming soon. There are planes above and warships below. You have to go. Go back and tell your family members that they are only allowed to smile and not allowed to cry! Crying means that you are not clear-headed. Whoever is unwilling to register to go to Taiwan is a Communist Party!"

    Wu Shixiao provided the investigation team with the following facts: On January 30, he saw more than 20 people, including farmer Mou Yongxiang and fisherman Zheng Naiyu, begging Feng Qixuan, the instructor of the Yue Mingli Bao Office: "We cannot go to Taiwan. We have land, houses, and fishing boats here. We will have nothing when we go to Taiwan. How can we live!" Feng Qixuan said: "Whoever doesn't go has ideological problems. Whoever doesn't want to go will be arrested tomorrow!"

    Lu Xiaohua told the investigation team that the residents of Huitou'ao Mountain, where the second company of the third assault battalion he was in was stationed, were summoned to the Wangye Temple every day for meetings in the five days before they were abducted. The battalion headquarters announced the "evacuation" order to the residents, and regardless of whether they were willing or not, all residents had to go to Taiwan.

    The investigation team learned that even under these intimidations, the residents were still unwilling to leave their homes. The Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents and police began to arrest residents in order to intimidate all those who were unwilling to leave. Wang Shoujian told the investigation team that he had repeatedly expressed his unwillingness to go to Taiwan in front of the Bao chief and the Lin chief. On February 2, he was arrested and imprisoned in the Dachen Liaison Station of the Chiang Kai-shek's National Defense Ministry's Bureau of Investigation and Statistics. His son, Wang Qichang, was also arrested on the night of February 4, when the residents were called to a meeting, because he had a stomachache and did not go.

    Wang Xianghua told the investigation team that she and her husband had secretly talked about their unwillingness to go to Taiwan at night. She had also told her neighbors Jiang Xuequan and Qin Jifa that she was unwilling to go to Taiwan. In the late night of February 2, the Bao instructor Zhu Zhuangfu and the police arrested her and took her to the Dachen Liaison Station of the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics. She was holding her one-year-and-two-month-old daughter, and the police did not allow her to bring diapers and did not allow the child to wear shoes and socks; she was cold and scared, and the police did not allow her to cry. When she arrived at the Dachen Liaison Station of the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, the secret agent said to her: "This woman is suspected of being a Communist Party." and locked her in a small room.

    Jia Wu’s wife was arrested by the police on the night of January 24. After being taken to the Dachen Liaison Station of the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, the secret agent said to her: "You old woman has ideological problems. Your son is on the mainland and you don't want to go to Taiwan."

    Wang Shoujian and the other nineteen were only a part of the arrested residents. The investigation team found that there were six prisons and detention centers on Dachen Island. Wang Shoujian and others all testified that there were more than 40 people who were imprisoned with them in an air-raid shelter before the abduction of residents. Among them, Jiang Zhongbo and the other twenty were tied up with hemp ropes by secret agents and police in the late night of February 2 and their whereabouts are unknown.
               ***
    After more than one hundred U.S. ships and more than five hundred U.S. aircraft arrived around Dachen on February 7, the abduction itself began on the next day. At that time, the residents of Dachen Island who were imprisoned by the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Yangqi Island near Lower Dachen Island, complained to the investigation team about what they saw of the U.S. armed forces threatening the residents of Dachen Island. They saw many U.S. warships sailing in the sea around Dachen Island, saw U.S. aircraft diving over these islands again and again, and heard a series of explosions on Lower Dachen. They were stunned at the time. Wang Shoujian said: "It's really scary to think about it. The American planes were like brushing our heads, rushing over and crashing over, scaring us to huddle in a mountain gully and tremble."

    Xie Jiaju, a staff officer of a naval unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, made detailed observations during the period when the U.S. military and the Chiang Kai-shek troops abducted the residents of Dachen and other islands. He explained to the investigation team in detail the number, type, and number of the U.S. ships he observed, as well as the activities of the ships and aircraft. He said: "More than one hundred ships of various types and various types of aircraft are rushing back and forth in the sea and sky of Dachen Island as if facing a formidable enemy, which is an extremely serious threat to those unarmed residents."

    The investigation team noted that Western news agencies had revealed that while the U.S. air and naval forces were active in the sea and sky of Dachen Island, the U.S. Marines and U.S. Navy demolition teams landed on Dachen Island and directly participated in the abduction and destruction activities.

    The investigation team came to the navy parade ground of the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Lower Dachen. This was one of the places where the U.S. military and the Chiang Kai-shek troops concentrated residents to board the ships. Except for an entrance and an exit, the parade ground was completely surrounded by barbed wire. Residents' belongings were thrown randomly on the parade ground. There were also piles of and scattered machine gun bullet casings nearby. This cannot but remind the investigation team of the Associated Press news of February 8: "Fully armed U.S. Marines landed on Dachen Island today to assist the withdrawal of Nationalist Chinese civilians and soldiers on the island. ... The Marines carried machine guns ashore and immediately set up the machine guns."

    During the on-site investigation, the investigation team saw that in many shops on Dachen Island, the calendar stopped on February 8. In the vegetable plots, some manure buckets were lying on the ground, and there was still half a spoon of manure in the manure spoon. In some families, the shuttle for mending fishing nets was still placed next to the broken fishing net; the clothes to be washed were soaked in the washing basin, and half a bar of soap was placed on it; the children's diapers were still drying on the stone bench in front of the door; the wooden comb used by women was still placed next to the broken dressing table. The vast majority of families still retained traces of eating or cooking, and some pots contained a pot or half a pot of porridge or vegetable soup, which were now moldy or smelly; some tables were still set with bowls and chopsticks, and the bowls contained unfinished small fish and pickles; some sweet potatoes were only bitten twice, and sweet potato shreds were still sticking to the chopsticks; some families had just put the washed green onions on the stove, and raw sweet potatoes were poured into the pot; some families had dough on the cutting board, and firewood for burning was still stuffed in the stove.

    All these unforgettable scenes show that the residents of Dachen Island were still persisting in their normal lives until the last moment they were forced to leave their homes, and were not willing to prepare to leave their homes. But the appearance of the U.S. military at the last moment—the muzzles of the U.S. ships aimed at Dachen Island, the U.S. aircraft diving over the heads of the residents, the U.S. Marines setting up machine guns on the shore—all this clearly told the kind residents of Dachen Island that if they refused to abandon their property and homes and step onto the U.S. landing craft according to the order, then they would have to pay with their own lives and the blood of their children.

    The investigation team also saw that at the wharf of Dachen Island, on the roads that the residents had walked, cotton wool, mosquito nets, rice, shoes and socks, as well as silver bells worn by children, and earrings and hairpins of women, merchants' account books and steelyards, etc., were thrown everywhere.

    All these show that the residents of Dachen Island were forced onto those U.S. ships in the atmosphere of tension and terror created by the U.S. military.

    On Nanji Island, the investigation team saw many wooden signs stuck in the ground on a small beach in the southeast of Dashanao, with the names of outlying islands such as "Zhuyu," "Menyu," and "Dalei" written on them. A boundary line was drawn around each wooden sign. In these places with wooden signs, the ground was full of scattered clothes, shovels, hoes, fishing nets, wooden boxes, pots, bowls, and other things. It is worth noting that many wooden sticks, iron sticks, grenades, and other weapons were discarded outside the surrounding boundary lines. The investigation team saw the same situation at the wharf of Pishan Island.
               ***
    The affected residents complained to the investigation team about the crimes of the U.S. military and the Chiang Kai-shek troops destroying their families and causing them to be separated from their loved ones. Wang Mengzheng and others said that when they were on Yangqi Island, they heard the continuous explosions on Dachen Island and saw the firelight on Dachen Island, and everyone was terrified. They worried about their homes and their loved ones. On the night of February 12, they were on Yangqi Island, looking at Huangfu Reef on the opposite Lower Dachen. They saw that there was not a single light in this village of more than one hundred households. Everyone waited anxiously all night until the next morning, when it was time to make breakfast, but they still did not see a wisp of smoke. At this time, they realized that their hometown had become a deserted island, so they all burst into tears.

    On the second day after the Chiang Kai-shek troops withdrew from Dachen Island, Chen Sanmei returned to his home and saw his wife's cotton clothes and a pair of shoes. He said: "I couldn't hold back my tears at that time." He said: "We have been married for twelve years and have never quarreled once. Although life has been hard, no one has ever complained." He also said: "She has always been in poor health and often gets sick, and I have always taken care of her. Now that we are so far apart, who will take care of her if she is sick?" Zheng Kaimei, a forty-one-year-old tailor, has a family of six. Now, his wife, two daughters, a son who is just one year old, and a teenage apprentice have all been abducted. Zheng Kaimei said: "In the past, although my life was not very rich, it was still a family anyway. What about now? A woman takes three children and a young apprentice to Taiwan. How can they live?" He also said: "These days, no matter when, as long as I think of this, I feel like my heart is being cut with a knife." He said that he often has nightmares at night, dreaming that his family members are suffering in Taiwan. Finally, he asked the investigation team: "When can my family be reunited?"

    Jia Wu’s wife lived with her brother. She said: "Our family has more than twenty people, four generations under one roof. Now when I return to that destroyed home, I can't see a single relative." She said: "In the past, every time it was time to eat, my five-year-old grand-niece Xiao He would come to call me: 'Grandma! It's time to eat!' Now, I can no longer hear Xiao He's voice." In addition to her husband and two older daughters being abducted to Taiwan, Wang Xianghua's husband's family also had sixteen members of four generations, and her family also had her sixty-year-old mother, brother, sister-in-law, and three nephews, who were also abducted. Now, only their lonely mother and daughter are left. Wang Xianghua's youngest daughter, Xiufeng, is only one year and two months old. She was arrested and imprisoned with her mother. Now she is Wang Xianghua's only relative.

    Chen Zhiyi and other former Chiang Kai-shek soldiers who were released by the Chinese People's Liberation Army and then imprisoned on Pingfeng Mountain, wrote in the accusation letter they handed to the investigation team: "After the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army escaped, we returned to Dachen. We still imagined that our families were still there. But when we landed, we saw that Dachen had become a dead island, and some houses were still burning. We returned to our homes. Although some houses were still there, the things had been looted and scattered all over the ground, and none of our family members were there. Our longing for our families became more and more intense. We wanted to go to Nanji to find our families. The Chinese People's Liberation Army helped us and found us a boat. We departed from Dachen on the afternoon of February 22 and arrived in Nanji at noon on the 25th. After landing, we learned that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army here had also escaped. We walked all over Nanji Island and did not see a single person. Where can we find our families! At this time, we people who had sold our lives to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army for several years and had been harmed by Chiang Kai-shek, causing us to be separated from our wives and children, shed bitter tears again. We cannot describe our sad state of mind at that time. We looked at the vast ocean and thought of our dear wives and parents. Our hearts were cut like a knife."

    Wang Shoujian, Lin Ziqing, Wang Xianghua, and others all said that if it weren't for the American soldiers helping, sending planes and big warships, the Kuomintang wouldn't even be able to run away themselves, let alone abduct all the common people. Now, we don't know if our relatives are alive or dead! ×××

    The investigation team also noted that from the day the Chiang Kai-shek troops abducted residents from Dachen and other islands, a tragic fate followed the abducted residents. On February 18, the Hong Kong Industrial and Commercial Daily claimed that "more than one hundred people over the age of seventy" were among the abducted residents of Dachen and other islands, and that these elderly people "died on the ships due to heart disease and tetanus after spasms." On February 11, The New York Times claimed that three people had died on the armed transport ship "USS. HENRICO". After the residents of Dachen and other islands arrived in Taiwan, the situation of illness and death became more serious. A notice issued by the Keelung Office of the Taiwan Guidance Association on February 17 said: "There are currently 95 people in hospitals...and a total of ten deaths."
  "From February 9 to 17, a total of 24 babies were born in various districts of Keelung, but seven babies died soon after." According to Taiwan's Central Daily News, when the residents of Dachen and other islands were dispersed from Keelung to various parts of Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek clique, "on the way from Hualien to Taitung, four women gave birth in the car." "A 67-year-old sick man, Xu Acheng, died on the ship on the way from Keelung to Hualien." "The 84-year-old lady Mou Yu’s wife and the young woman Ye Xialing and others have been sick and struggling to walk since they arrived in Pingtung from Keelung." "Mou Yu’s wife died on March 6." The Yilan County Health Institute alone checked 2,775 residents assigned to the county from March 3 to 16, and "1,661 people were ill."

    According to Taiwan's Zhengxin News on February 13, when the residents of Dachen and other islands were abducted to Taiwan, "family members were living separately, so there have been incidents of wives losing contact with their husbands, and sons waiting for their parents to come and claim them." According to Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao: "The number of people registered 'seeking' has reached more than 550."

    The lives of the residents of Dachen and other islands became even more difficult after they arrived in Taiwan. After they arrived in Keelung, they were immediately sent to various "reception centers." They lived in "classrooms with no tables, chairs, or beds, and only a few straw mats and cushions were laid on the ground." (Taiwan's China Daily, February 11) On February 28, Chiang Kai-shek's Central Daily News claimed that the residents of Dachen and other islands who were abducted to the "reception center" in Luodong Dongshan Township, Yilan County, "received a bag of rice from the designated Jianfeng Rice Mill on the 26th, but in addition to being partially moldy, there were also small pieces of rubble, stones, coal slag, wood chips, rat droppings, etc. The raw rice was cooked into rice, and a musty smell wafted out, making it difficult to swallow and chew." The living conditions of the residents of Dachen and other islands were already so poor, but the Chiang Kai-shek clique forced them to "save" and "donate" for the so-called "building ships to avenge." As a result, all the "reception centers" had to "donate." Taiwan newspapers revealed that the suffering residents of Keelung's Sixth "Reception Center" alone were squeezed out of 507 kilograms of rice in this way. This kind of deprivation by the Chiang Kai-shek clique aroused the public anger of these residents. An

    大陈浩劫
    ——中国红十字会关于蒋军在美国指使和掩护下撤出大陈等岛时所犯罪行的调查报告书
     一九五五年四月七日于北京
    前言
    一九五五年二月五日，美国总统艾森豪威尔命令美国第七舰队和美国其他部队，掩护蒋介石军队从大陈等岛撤走，并把大陈等岛的居民撤运到台湾去。接着，美国军事当局，以第七舰队为主，调集了一百三十二艘舰艇、五百多架飞机、四万五千名海军人员、三千名空军人员，参与了这一行动。
    美国政府的重要官员，如美国第七舰队司令普赖德，美国驻台湾大使兰金、美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团团长蔡斯、美国海军少将萨宾，都曾先后来到大陈岛视察、部署、监督撤运工作。
    盘踞浙江东部海面大陈、渔山、披山等岛的蒋军，在美国军队的协助下在二月十二日全部撤走。并劫走了这些岛上的一万八千多名居民。二月十四日到二十五日，蒋军在美国政府的指使下，从浙江南部海面南麂岛撤走的同时，又劫走了这个岛上的全部居民二千多人。
    一九五五年二月十三日和二十六日，中国人民解放军先后在大陈、渔山、披山、南麂等岛登陆。经中国人民解放军拯救脱险的被蒋军囚禁在大陈岛附近洋岐岛和屏风山上的居民等五十九人，愤怒地控诉了大陈等岛二万多名和平居民是在美军和蒋军穷凶极恶的暴力下被强迫离开他们的家乡的，美军和蒋军还毫无怜惜地烧毁和破坏了大陈等岛居民所辛勤建造和积累起来的房屋和财产，使得他们再也无家可归。这五十九人是：
    被蒋军无辜囚禁在洋岐岛的大陈岛的居民王守鉴、林子清、王其昌、王香花、颜楚庭、林明瑶、陈三妹、谢宝贤、吴时孝、王梦正、郏吴氏、郑楷梅、叶坚林、王义才、苏炳麟、洪琛、陈正谊等十九人（内有一岁多的小孩一名）。
    中国人民解放军释放的家属在大陈岛的原蒋军士兵陈志一、诸葛华、赵胜、胡阿英、王志平、曾庭鹏、朱国光等二十一人。他们在一江山岛战斗中被中国人民解放军俘掳，释放回去后，被蒋军分别囚禁在洋岐岛和屏风山。
    被蒋军武力劫去囚禁在洋岐岛的浙江省沿海地区的渔民方贤岳、陈其和、陈秋才、陈其文、刘福根等十六人。
    此外，尚有蒋军从大陈岛撤走时留在大陈岛上的两个居民：一个是病势垂危的老人孔江波，他经过中国人民解放军医务人员的救治，现已恢复健康，另一人是神经完全失常的疯子罗小番。还有在蒋军从披山岛撤走时，一个隐藏在该岛山洞中的蒋军伙夫陆小华。
    中国红十字会在获悉这一关于大规模劫运的指控后，为了维护人道主义的原则，特组织了中国红十字会调查团，从一九五五年三月三日到二十二日，分别到大陈、渔山、披山、南麂等岛及其附近的各小岛屿，对蒋军在美国政府指使和美国军队掩护下撤走时所制造的罪行进行了实地调查，并慰问和救济了受难的居民。随同调查团前往的尚有下列五十一人：
    家居大陈等岛，在蒋军撤走前逃出来求生的渔民叶永茶、钱兴铭、董文乐、郑阿仙、王思汉、梅阿根等十九人。
    被蒋军武力劫运到台湾的家在浙江省沿海地区的渔民家属李伙渊、李良炎等九人。
    中国人民解放军海军某部参谋谢嘉聚，陆军某部工兵副连长陈玉坤、工兵排长伍湘云，侦察排长郝化泰和战士应官奎、金积荣、罗贤芳等二十三人。
    调查团在调查期间，访问了目睹这一暴行的所有人证，搜集了蒋军尚未完全毁灭掉的物证，对于重要的证词进行了录音，并将破坏情况拍摄了电影和照片。调查团经过详细调查和反复对证，证实前述关于美军与蒋军曾暴力劫走大陈等岛全部居民的指控乃是证据确凿无可争辩的事实。
    现将这次调查的结果，公布于中国人民和全世界人民的面前。
    （一）劫运居民
    调查团在调查过程中，发现了蒋介石的军政机关曾不予当地人民以任何选择余地，一再用军事和行政命令来达到其劫走大陈等岛二万多居民的罪恶目的。
    调查团在蒋介石的大陈区行政督察专员公署的瓦砾堆中寻找出一些烧剩的文件。其中有一份是台湾蒋军代参谋总长彭孟缉拍来的电报。调查团从这烧剩的半张纸上，看到如下的字句：“××能全数策运来台。闻大陈有重病年高者数人，运台有困难。奉总统谕，应排除任何困难，必要时用担架担运上船，必须运台。希遵办。彭。．02.07
　．15.40”
  （调查团注：××二字字迹不清）
    调查团团员还从捡到的一张蒋军大陈部队长的“告民众书”上，看到以下的字句：“蒋总统……特令本岛民众前往台湾。本部奉令执行。”
    调查团从下列事实证实大陈等岛居民是不愿遵从这一强迫他们背乡离井的命令的，调查团从被囚禁在洋岐岛的原大陈岛居民中了解到当大陈岛居民听到蒋介石劫运居民的命令后，发生了极大的不安。黄夫礁的老渔民王守鉴说：“起先，邻长王三玉叫我拿着身份证到警察局去登记。我回答：我不去台湾。我在大陈有房子，有山地，有小船，可以打鱼，可以种地，到台湾没有房住，没有地种，又不能打鱼，是死路一条。”王守鉴说：“我们黄夫礁一百多户渔民，听到要我们到台湾去的时候，家家都哭哭啼啼。我的二女儿王香蕉嫁在大小浦，她来家时对我说，大小浦二百多户人家，也没有一户情愿去。”
    调查团在南麂岛从乱纸堆中捡到两本蒋军日记。这两本日记中都记述了居民不愿到台湾去的情形。从记述的事情来看，有一本像是一个副班长写的。他在二月十一日的日记中写道：“……老百姓听说要到台弯（湾）去，每家的老百姓心慌张，哭的哭，多数人民都是不原（愿）意上台湾。他们都是说家里好，都是一脸的苦想（相）。我们看到他们，心里也是非常之难过，也无法可想。……”另一本像是一个传令兵写的，他在二月十四日的日记中写道：“……我到三盘尾送口令，看见一些老百姓哭哭啼啼。有几位老的，年纪过大的，村长通知他，叫他马上到大山×（一字不清）集合，并带行礼（李）走。但都不高兴去。”在二月十五日的日记上，他写着：“……这次老百姓很舍不得离开此地，因为此地老百姓，是靠打渔（鱼）过生活，如果到台湾，他感觉难过！”（调查团注：日记中的有些标点和括号内的字，都是我们按的。）
    被囚禁在洋岐岛上的大陈岛居民王守鉴、王香花、林明瑶等人和披山岛原蒋军伙夫陆小华，都向调查团证实，美国政府和蒋介石集团为了把大陈等岛居民劫往台湾，除了发布命令之外，还采取了严密控制，武装威胁等暴力手段。事实如下：
    蒋介石的大陈区行政督察专员公署，以原有统治大陈等岛人民的保甲组织为基础，建成所谓“疏散组织”，自上而下地把居民全部控制在这个组织之内。一月下旬，大陈区（包括大陈、渔山、披山等岛）成立了“大陈区民众疏散指挥部”，由蒋介石的大陈区行政督察专员沈之岳任总指挥。大陈本岛两个乡、一个镇各成立“疏散”总队，各保为“疏散”大队，三个或四个邻（邻即甲）为“疏散”中队，各邻为“疏散”区队，邻内成立三个“疏散”小组，每小组有三户或四户居民。乡长、镇长、保长、邻长分别任总队长、大队长、中队长、区队长。
    蒋介石的大陈区行政督察专员公署和温岭县政府，都派人督察和监视镇长、乡长、保长、保指导员、邻长等进行胁迫居民去台湾的工作。王守鉴说：“黄夫礁的保长王小妹是我的亲侄儿。国民党强迫老百姓上台湾去的时期里，我看到他时常被叫到县政府去开会，回来就唉声叹气。有一次他对我说：你们非走不行，不然上面要杀我的头！”
    蒋介石的大陈区行政督察专员公署并采取强行登记和发“疏散”证的办法，强迫大陈等岛居民到台湾去。林明瑶说，一月二十日左右，温岭县政府通知：“自愿疏散者可到警察局登记”，领取“疏散”证。这办法并没有生效。到一月二十七日，温岭县政府突然通知，居民姓名统由各保造册上报。保里就马上叫各邻长收拢各户居民的身份证，造好全部名册。邻长接着就通知各户说：“你们的名字我已上报了。”一月二十九日“疏散”证发到成功镇，是一块一寸宽、三寸长的白布条。布条的上沿写号码，下面写姓名，并盖有图章。“疏散”证由各保长根据已造好的名册填上名字，再发给各户居民。规定不论老弱妇孺一律要挂在身上。王梦正、王其昌、王守鉴、王香花、苏炳麟、吴时孝、孔江波都证实蒋介石的军政人员强令居民挂“疏散”证。邻长曾交代他们说：“疏散证发下来了，你们不能不走！”苏炳麟记得他的“疏散”证的号码是四百零八号。
      调查团在南麂岛蒋介石的平阳县政府废墟上、拾到一本“平阳县民众疏散赴台名册”，上面记载着南麂岛全部居民的姓名、年龄、性别和编号，并附有每个居民的照片。在蒋军撤走前从南麂岛逃出来的居民钱兴铭告诉调查团说：“这是‘生死簿’，如果有人不肯到台湾去，国民党就照这上面的号码来追查他的全家和‘三户连环保’的其他两户。”根据林明瑶等所谈的事实，调查团了解到：
  “三户连环保”是蒋介石的军政机关在大陈等岛统治居民的一种暴虐手段。办法是叫居民三家互相联保具结，一家“有罪”，其他两户都要连坐。调查团在蒋介石的成功镇镇公所找到一张已撕毁的“连保切结证书”。在残留的半截纸上，有“联保人互相监视严密”等字句，纸的背面印着对连坐人的处罚条例，有“……、无期徒刑、十年以上有期徒刑”等。在这张“连保切结证书”上签名画押的，是和平里第七邻的三户居民：林谢氏、冯锦常、陶凤香。王香花、王守鉴等都向调查团说，我们老百姓最怕“连保切结”，保长对我们说过：“三家保一家，不去台湾不行！”
    王守鉴等还向调查团控诉了蒋介石的军政人员集中渔民的渔船的情况。大陈岛所有渔船在一月三十日以前都被集中起来。黄夫礁渔民王其昌说：“一月二十三日，国民党强迫我把我的渔船撑到浪通门，并且叫人把船拉到岸上。我看到黄夫礁的渔船，也都被集中在那里。这样，四面是海，我们逃也逃不脱。”调查团在大陈岛的大小浦港口看到三十九只渔船被搁在岸上。在浪通门的滩头上，又看到搁在那里的二十七只渔船。调查团观察到：在以上两处渔船集中的地方，都埋有地雷，并且布着铁丝网。
    林明瑶等谈到在“疏散”证发下的当天下午，蒋介石的温岭县政府军事科长郁策同，曾到海军操场集合成功镇邻长以上人员讲话，规定了居民上船的集合地点、码头和路线。调查团在蒋介石的大陈区行政督察专员办公室废墟中，捡到一份“大陈民众疏散指挥部各队集结要点图”，图上标明了劫运居民各队集中的地点、上船的路线和码头。调查团按图到了海军操场、南田、卫生院等居民集中地点，并按图上所示上船路线走向码头。调查团发现这些路都很窄，有的是沿海边的小道，有的是山间的小道；而在这些小道不远的地方，都有通向码头的公路。调查团不明白这个大陈区行政督察专员公署为什么要一万多居民走这样的小路，而不从公路上码头。苏炳麟说：“路狭，国民党好监视老百姓，不让老百姓逃掉。”
    调查团还检到一份“大陈民众疏散指挥部疏散民众统一宣传指示”。这个“指示”要求它的各级人员“按指示立即向所属各户宣传”。有一项“宣传”内容是：“疏散到台湾，是一种难逢的机会，大家在疏散的时候，要快快活活、高高兴兴，绝对不忧、不哭、不喊叫。”在另一份“民众疏散旅行守则”上，也有这样的字句：“到达台湾，要高高兴兴，向欢迎人员欢呼致谢。”
    据王香花说，当黄夫礁的居民哭哭啼啼不愿到台湾去的时候，保指导员朱庄福就召集黄夫礁居民开会。朱庄福说：“共产党来了，要把大陈的人全部杀掉！”又说：“美国第七舰队快要来了。上有飞机，下有兵舰，不去不行。你们回去给家里人说，只准他们笑，不准他们哭！哭就是脑筋不清楚。谁不愿意登记去台湾，谁就是共产党！”
    吴时孝向调查团提供了这样的事实：一月三十日，他看到农民牟永祥、渔民郑乃玉等二十多人向岳明里保办公室指导员冯启轩哀求：“我们不能去台湾，我们在这里有地、有房子、有渔船，到了台湾什么也没有了，怎样活！”冯启轩说：“谁不去谁就有思想问题，那个不想去，明天就抓起来！”
    陆小华向调查团说：他所在的突击第三大队第二中队住地汇头岙山头的居民，在被劫运前五天中，每天都被召集到王爷庙开会。大队部向居民宣布了“疏散”的命令，不管愿意不愿意，要所有的居民都到台湾去。
    调查团了解到：在这些恫吓之下，居民们仍是不愿意离开他们的家乡的。蒋介石的特务和警察机关于是开始拘捕居民，以慑服所有不愿离开的人。王守鉴告诉调查团，他曾屡次在保长、邻长面前表示过不愿去台湾。二月二日他便被抓到蒋介石的国防部保密局大陈联络站囚禁起来。他的儿子王其昌，在二月四日居民被叫去开会的时候，因为肚子痛没有去，当晚也被捕了。
    王香花向调查团谈到：在夜里，她和丈夫悄悄地谈过不愿到台湾去。她也和邻居蒋学全和秦济法说过不愿去台湾的话。二月二日深夜，保指导员朱庄福和警察把她抓到保密局大陈联络站。她抱着一岁两个月的小女孩，警察不准她带尿布，又不准小孩穿鞋袜；她又冷又怕，警察还不准她哭。到了保密局大陈联络站，特务对她说：“你这女人有共产党嫌疑。”就把她关在一个小房子里。
    郏吴氏是在一月二十四日晚上被警察抓去的。抓到保密局大陈联络站以后，特务对她说：“你这个老太婆有思想问题，儿子在大陆，不愿到台湾去。”
    王守鉴等十九人仅仅是被捕居民的一部分。调查团发现大陈岛有六个监狱和拘留所。王守鉴等都证实在劫运居民前和他们一起被关在一个防空洞的就有四十多个人。其中有姜钟波等二十人，在二月二日深夜被特务和警察用麻绳捆绑出去后不知去向。
                ×××
    二月七日百余艘美国的舰艇，五百余架美国的飞机到达大陈四周后，劫运本身便在第二天开始了。当时被蒋军囚禁在下大陈岛附近洋岐岛上的大陈岛居民们，曾纷纷向调查团诉说他们当时所见美国武装力量威胁大陈岛居民的情形。他们看到很多美国军舰，行驶在大陈岛周围的海里，看到美国飞机在这些岛屿上一次次俯冲，并且听到下大陈响起了一片爆炸声。他们当时吓呆了。王守鉴说：“想起来真可怕，美国人的飞机就像紧擦着头顶一样，冲过去，撞过来，吓得我们挤在一条山沟里直发抖。”
    中国人民解放军海军某部参谋谢嘉聚，在美国军队和蒋军劫运大陈等岛居民的期间，曾进行了详细的观察。他把观察到的美国舰艇的数目、类型、号码，以及舰艇和飞机活动的情况，详细地向调查团作了说明。他说：“一百多艘各种不同类型的舰艇和各种不同类型的飞机，在大陈岛海面上和天空中，如临大敌似地冲来冲去，这对于那些手无寸铁的居民，是有极其严重的威胁的。”
    调查团注意到西方通讯社曾经透露，在美国海空军在大陈岛的海面和天空活动的同时，美国海军陆战队、美国海军爆破组登上了大陈岛，直接参加了劫运和破坏活动。
    调查团来到下大陈蒋军的海军操场。这里曾是美国军队和蒋军集中居民登船的地点之一。这个操场除了一个进口和一个出口外，全部用铁丝网包围着。居民的东西乱抛在操场上。附近还有成堆和散乱的机关枪子弹壳。这不能不使调查团想起美国合众社二月八日的消息：“全副武装的美国海军陆战队今天已在大陈岛登陆，协助岛上国民党中国平民和士兵撤退。……海军陆战队携带机枪上岸，并立即把机枪架起来”。
    调查团在进行实地调查时看到：在大陈岛很多商店里，日历撕到二月八日就停止了。在菜地里，有的粪桶倒在地里，粪勺里还有半勺粪肥。有些家庭中，织补渔网的梭子还搁在破鱼网旁边；要洗的衣服浸在洗衣盆里，上面还搁着半块肥皂；小孩的尿布还晒在门前的石凳上；妇女用的木梳子还搁在打碎了的镜台旁。绝大多数的家庭，都还保存着正在吃饭或煮饭的痕迹，有些锅里留有一锅或半锅稀饭或菜汤，这些现在都已发霉或发臭；有些桌上还放着碗筷，碗里还有没有吃完的小鱼、咸菜；有的蕃薯只咬了两口，筷子上还黏着蕃薯丝；有些家庭刚把洗干净的葱放在灶上，生蕃薯倒在锅里；有些家庭的案板上丢着和好的面团，灶膛里还塞着烧火的柴。
    所有这些令人难忘的景象，说明大陈岛的居民直到被迫离开家园的最后一刻，还在坚持着他们的正常生活，没有甘愿离开家乡的准备。但是美军在最后一刻的出现——美国舰艇上的炮口对着大陈岛，美国飞机在居民头顶上俯冲着，美军陆战队在岸上架起机枪——所有这一切，清楚地告诉了善良的大陈岛上的居民，如果他们不肯抛下财产和家园，按照命令踏上美国的登陆艇，那么他们便要付出他们自己的生命和他们子女的鲜血。
    调查团还看到在大陈岛的码头上，在居民所走过的道路上，到处抛掷有棉絮、蚊帐、大米、鞋袜以及孩子们佩戴的银铃，和妇女们的耳环、簪子，商人们的账本和秤杆……。
    这些都说明大陈岛的居民是在美军所制造的紧张和恐怖的气氛中，被强迫赶上那些美国船只的。
    在南麂岛，调查团在大沙岙东南一个不大的海滩上，看到许多插在地上的木牌，上面分别写着“竹屿”、“门屿”、“大擂”等外围岛屿的名字。每一个木牌的四周都划上界线。就在这些有木牌的地方，满地都是散乱的衣服、板锄、镢头、渔网、木盒、锅、碗等东西。值得注意的是，在四周的界线外，丢弃着不少木棍、铁棍、手榴弹等武器。在披山岛的码头上，调查团看到了同样的情形。
                ×××
    受难的居民们，都向调查团控诉了美国军队和蒋军破坏他们家庭、害得他们骨肉离散的罪行。王梦正等说，当他们在洋岐岛上，听到大陈岛上连续不断的爆炸声，看到大陈岛上的火光时，没有一个人不是心惊胆战的。他们担心自己的家，担心自己的亲人。在二月十二日那天晚上，他们在洋岐岛上，遥望对面下大陈上的黄夫礁，他们看到这个一百多户居民的村落里，没有一点灯光，大家焦急地等了一夜，一直等到第二天清早，该是做早饭的时候了，却仍然见不到一缕炊烟。这时，他们明白了，自己的家乡已经成了一个无人岛，于是都放声大哭了。
    在蒋军从大陈岛撤走后的第二天，陈三妹回到自己家里的时候，他看到了妻子的棉衣和一双鞋。他说：“当时我再也忍不住自己的眼泪了。”他说：“我们结婚十二年，从来没有吵过一次嘴，日子虽说过得苦，谁也没说过一句抱怨的话。”他又说：“她一向身体不好，常常闹病，都是我照看她。现在，我们隔得这么远，她要是有个病痛的话，谁去管她？”四十一岁的裁缝郑楷梅，一家六口人。现在，他的妻子、两个女儿、一个刚满周岁的儿子和一个十几岁的小徒弟，都被劫运走了。郑楷梅说：“在过去，我的生活虽然过得并不宽裕，可是好好歹歹总还算是一家人。现在呢？一个女人带着三个小孩和一个小徒弟到台湾去了，他们可怎么样生活呢？”他还说：“这些天来，不管什么时候，我只要一想到这里，心里就像刀子割一样。”他说他夜里常做恶梦，梦见亲人们在台湾吃尽了苦，受尽了罪。最后他问调查团：“我这一家人什么时候才能团聚呢？”
    郏吴氏是和他哥哥一起生活的。她说：“我们一家是二十多口，四代同堂。现在我回到那个被破坏了的家里时，一个亲人都看不见了。”她说：“在过去，每到吃饭时，我五岁的侄孙女小荷就要来叫我：‘阿婆！吃饭啦！’现在，我再也听不见小荷的声音了。”王香花除了自己的丈夫和两个大女儿被劫往台湾之外，她的婆家还有祖孙四辈的十六口人，她的娘家还有六十岁的妈妈、哥哥、嫂嫂和三个外甥，也都被劫走了。现在，只剩下她们孤孤单单的母女两个了。王香花的小女儿秀凤才一岁零两个月，她是跟随自己的妈妈一同被捕、一同被囚禁的。现在她是王香花唯一的亲人了。
    被中国人民解放军释放回大陈岛而后又被囚禁在屏风山上的原蒋军士兵陈志一等，他们在交给调查团的控诉书上写道：“蒋贼军逃跑之后，我们回到了大陈。我们还幻想我们的家属还在。但是我们登岸一看，大陈已变成了死岛，有的房屋还在燃烧。我们回到了自己的住处，虽然有的房屋还在，可是东西已被抢得满地皆是，家人一个也没有了。我们对家人的怀念愈来愈切。我们要到南麂追寻我们的家人。中国人民解放军帮助了我们，又给我们找了一条船。我们二月二十二日下午由大陈出发，到二十五日中午到南麂。登岸之后，才知道这里的蒋贼军也已逃跑。我们走遍了南麂岛，一个人影也没有看见，还那里去找家人啊！这时候，我们这些给蒋贼军卖命数年，又被蒋贼害得妻离子散的人，又一次流下辛酸的眼泪。我们无法说明我们当时的悲痛心境，我们望着汪洋大海，想着亲爱的妻子父母，心如刀割。”
    王守鉴、林子清、王香花等都说，要不是美国兵帮忙，开来飞机和大兵舰，国民党连他自己都跑不了，又那里能把老百姓全给劫走。现在，不知我们的亲人生死存亡了！×××
    调查团还注意到，从蒋军在大陈等岛劫运居民那天开始起，悲惨的命运就跟随着被劫运的居民。二月十八日香港工商日报称，在被劫运的大陈等岛居民中“年逾古稀的人达百余位”，这些老人“在舰上，因心脏病及痉挛后破伤风而死者二人”。二月十一日纽约时报称，在武装运输舰“亨里可号”（USS．HENRICO）上有三人死亡。大陈等岛居民到了台湾之后，疾病和死亡的情况更趋严重。台湾辅导会基隆办事处二月十七日发表的公告说：“现经医院留治者共九十五人……，死亡者共十人。”
  “从二月九日至十七日止，在基隆各区生产的婴儿计有二十四人，但七个婴儿不久即死去。”据台湾中央日报透露，大陈等岛居民被蒋介石集团从基隆分散到台湾各地时，在“从花莲转往台东途中，有四个妇女在车中生产。”“有一六十七岁生病的老人许阿成，在从基隆赴花莲途中的船上病死。”“八十四岁老太太牟俞氏和少妇叶夏领等从基隆到屏东后已病得步履艰难。”“牟俞氏于三月六日死去。”仅宜兰县卫生院自三月三日至十六日检查分到该县的居民二千七百七十五个人中，“患病者达一千六百六十一人。”
    据二月十三日台湾征信新闻报道，大陈等岛居民在被劫运到台湾时，“家人均已分开居住，以致连日发生太太和丈夫失了联络、儿子等待父母来认领等情事。”据香港大公报称：“登记‘寻找’的已达五百五十余人。”
    大陈等岛居民到了台湾之后，生活更加困苦。他们到达基隆后，立即被送到各个“接待所”。他们是住在“既无桌椅、又无床铺的教室内，地下铺了几张草席和草垫。”（二月十一日台湾中华日报）二月二十八日蒋贼中央日报称，被劫到宜兰县罗东冬山乡“接待所”的大陈等岛居民，“于二十六日在指定的建丰米厂领来食米一包，除部分发霉外，尚有小块瓦砾、石子、炭渣、木屑、老鼠屎等。生米做成熟饭，一股霉味扑鼻，委难吞食、嚼咽。”大陈等岛居民的生活条件已经如此低劣，而蒋介石集团还强迫他们为所谓“建舰复仇”来“节约”、“捐献”。于是，各个“接待所”都要“捐”，台湾报纸透露，仅基隆第六“接待所”的受难居民就被这样压榨去了食米五百零七公斤。蒋介石集团的这种剥夺，激起了这些居民的公愤。合众社台北三月二日电称：“今晨他们（指大陈被劫居民）……走到城里国民党的总部，包围党委们，并宣称：他们不能按照（国民）党所宣布的节约法案去生活。”
