    Comrades, the working people of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, the working class of the capitalist and colonial world, and all progressive mankind are commemorating a memorable festival—the 85th anniversary of the birth of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.
    Lenin was a giant of revolutionary theory and revolutionary action, the great founder of the Communist Party, the father of the world's first Soviet socialist state, and the leader of the working people of all countries.
    Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, the two great teachers and theorists of the working class, armed the working class with a truly scientific worldview. They discovered the laws of capitalism's emergence, development, and demise, and scientifically demonstrated the inevitability of socialist revolution. They revealed the historical role of the working class as the gravedigger of capitalism and the creator of socialist society. They outlined the two stages of communist development. In the most profound, creative, and revolutionary sense, Lenin was an orthodox Marxist, and he greatly enriched the treasure house of Marxist thought.
    Lenin appeared on the stage of political struggle in a new era, when capitalism was transitioning from its pre-monopoly stage to the stage of imperialism. At that time, the contradictions of capitalism were particularly acute in Russia. The center of the world liberation movement was shifting here. It was here that the greatest revolutionary struggles were brewing. It was Russia that gave the world Lenin. It is the homeland of Leninism.
    At the same time, Leninism is deeply rooted in international development and the worldwide liberation movement. Leninism is an international doctrine. Leninism is the Marxism of the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution, the Marxism of the era of building communism. It concentrates the great achievements of human wisdom throughout history. Based on a brilliant summary of the worldwide experience in this new historical period, Lenin developed and enriched Marxist philosophy—dialectical materialism and historical materialism—as well as Marxist political economy. Leninism is the highest achievement of Russian and world culture.
    Lenin was a great revolutionary strategist. With his thinker's profound insight, Lenin excavated the inherent development process of the capitalist mode of production, and he was the author of outstanding works on the study of imperialism. After discovering the law of uneven economic and political development of capitalist countries in the era of imperialism, he created a new, complete theory of socialist revolution, which is the banner and theoretical foundation of the great October Socialist Revolution that illuminates the path to a new life for all oppressed humanity.
    Lenin wrote: "We have the right to be proud, to consider ourselves fortunate, because we are the first to overthrow the capitalist beast in a part of the world. Capitalism has drowned humanity in blood, it has plunged humanity into famine and barbarism; capitalism must perish, and will perish soon, no matter how cruel and terrible its violent death throes may appear."
    Before our eyes, the old, declining world capitalist system is increasingly falling apart, while the new, rising world socialist system is constantly developing and growing stronger. The twentieth century is the century of the victory of the invincible Marxist-Leninist ideology.
    Lenin was a great scientific leader. Lenin discovered the laws, methods, and forms for the socialist transformation of society, and the laws for building communism, thereby raising Marxism to a higher level. He comprehensively elucidated the issue of the dictatorship of the proletariat, arguing that the highest principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat is the fundamental principle of the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class. He created the theory of the national-colonial question. He clarified the most important economic problems of building socialism and communism. The powerful multi-ethnic Soviet state—the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics—vividly embodies the great transformative power of Leninist thought.
    Lenin combined the qualities of a great thinker and political fighter, a master of revolutionary change and an organizer of hundreds of millions of people, In the early days of the proletarian revolutionary movement in Russia, Lenin said: "Give us a revolutionary organization, and we can turn Russia upside down." He founded, ideologically trained, and cultivated our glorious Communist Party as such an organization of revolutionaries.
    The Leninist party stood at the forefront of the working class in the social struggles of three revolutions. The party led the Soviet people in an unselfish struggle to defend the freedom and independence of their country during the years of civil war and imperialist intervention. In the fierce struggle against the Mensheviks, Trotskyites, right-wing capitalist restorationists, and all kinds of enemies of the people, the party, under the leadership of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause, overcame the greatest hardships and led our country to the victory of socialism. Under the leadership of the Party, the Soviet people and their heroic armed forces defeated the well-equipped Hitlerite aggressors in the Great Patriotic War, saving the whole world from the threat of fascist enslavement.
    Today, the Communist Party, under the leadership of Lenin's outstanding comrades-in-arms and students, is inspiring and organizing our people to engage in the great constructive labor of building a communist society. Leninism was, is, and will always be the fighting and victorious banner of the Party.
    Comrades! When the Soviet people first engaged in the social transformation along the socialist line, they had to rely on the extremely backward economy left over from the past.
    Based on the new revolutionary theory that socialism could first be victorious in one country, Lenin scientifically formulated a plan for building a socialist society in our country. The components of this plan were: (1) socialist industrialization of the country, (2) socialist transformation of agriculture based on peasant production cooperation, and (3) cultural revolution. Lenin pointed out that we had all the necessary conditions to build a truly strong and prosperous socialist country.
    As early as 1917, Lenin put forward a huge task to the Party and the people—to move forward with all our strength and eliminate Russia's technical and economic backwardness within a very short historical period.
    Lenin taught us that large-scale machine industry, the production of the means of production, is the material foundation of socialism. Guided by this Leninist plan, the Communist Party, under the leadership of Stalin, carried out a fundamental transformation of the Soviet economy on the basis of socialist industrialization. Once Lenin's thought was grasped by the masses, it became a powerful material force. The Soviet state completed a great leap, transforming from backward to advanced. In less than twenty years, the Soviet Union completed the industrial development path that the oldest capitalist country in the world, Britain, spent almost two centuries on since the Industrial Revolution, and the United States spent about a century on. Today, the Soviet Union is a powerful industrial country. In 1954, the total output of Soviet large-scale industry was 35 times the level of 1913 (calculated at comparable prices), the production of the means of production was almost 60 times, electricity generation 75 times, and the production of the machine manufacturing industry more than 160 times. These figures show the great superiority of the socialist planned economic system.
    Comrades! Marx and Engels very keenly foresaw the necessity of socialist transformation of agriculture after the victory of the proletarian revolution. However, they naturally could not formulate a specific program for this transformation, nor did they set themselves the task of formulating such a program. Such a profound and wise program that attracted the broadest masses of peasants was put forward in Lenin's cooperative plan.
    Lenin taught that after the proletariat has achieved class victory over the bourgeoisie, an educated cooperative membership system under public ownership of the means of production is the socialist system. "To put this most backward form of production—agriculture—on a new track, to transform it and to transform tillage from a method of production carried out by ancient, uncivilized methods into a method of production based on the achievements of science and technology" is our duty and responsibility.
    Armed with Lenin's cooperative plan, the Communist Party, relying on the growing strength of socialist industry, led the working class and hundreds of millions of peasants in carrying out this great transformation in the countryside.
    Never in the history of world social development has there been such a wide and profound change in the basis of production, a change in the lifestyle of hundreds of millions of people, as was achieved by the overall collectivization and elimination of the rich peasant class after the October Revolution. Replacing the old private ownership in the countryside and its long history of differentiation of small commodity producers and mass suffering, a new and unprecedented collective farm system has been established. This system has eliminated the differences among peasants, the enslavement of rich peasants, and the suffering and poverty in the countryside; it has opened up unlimited prospects for the development of agricultural productive forces and for the improvement of the material welfare and cultural level of collective farmers. The collective farm system is one of the greatest achievements of the Soviet people.
    Completing the national industrialization, completing the collectivization of agriculture, and on this basis eliminating the exploiting classes and the true sources of the phenomenon of human exploitation of man, completing a profound cultural revolution, establishing a multi-ethnic state on the basis of voluntary alliance, brotherly trust, and mutual assistance; all of these mean the complete victory of the great Leninist plan—to transform Russia into a powerful socialist country.
    The Soviet people have reason to be proud of their great achievements. But the Party requires the Soviet people to continue to move forward unswervingly along the path pointed out by the scientific program of communism. Leninism is a doctrine that is forever full of life and vitality.
    Lenin said when the socialist revolution was still in its infancy: "When carrying out socialist reforms, we must clearly focus on the final goal of these reforms, which is to establish a communist society..."
    Leninism is the compass, the powerful ideological weapon that enables our Party to correctly determine the direction in the extremely complex laws of social development, to understand the internal connections between historical events, to foresee the development process of these historical events, and to lead the masses of the people with confidence.
    To complete the construction of socialism and gradually transition to the second stage of communism, it is first necessary to continuously and greatly develop the productive forces of socialist society on the basis of advanced technology, to realize the electrification of the entire national economy, to complete the complete mechanization of labor in all sectors of the national economy, and to implement widespread production automation and chemicalization. This vigorous upsurge of the entire social production is entirely based on the accelerated development of heavy industry.
    Some Soviet and scientific workers believe that under the current conditions, it is no longer necessary to rapidly develop heavy industry, and now the main focus should be shifted to the problems of light industry. The Party has exposed the pseudo-scientific nature, political harm, and anti-Leninist essence of their views. This is a decadent theory that disarms our people. If implemented, it would weaken the entire national economy, lower the living standards of the working people, and undermine the defense capabilities of the socialist state.
    Lenin once pointed out: "Large-scale machine industry is the only possible material foundation of socialism. Whoever forgets this is not a communist." Lenin called the priority development of heavy industry and the production of the means of production an economic law. If this law is valid for capitalism, then it has absolute significance, a hundred times greater, for socialism, because a mature socialist society must far exceed any country, even the most developed capitalist country, in the level of industrial development.
    Heavy industry was, and will continue to be, the cornerstone of the socialist economy and its backbone. Only on the basis of the rapid development of heavy industry is it possible to realize the vigorous upsurge of productive forces, to further consolidate the economic and defense strength of the country, to complete the widespread mechanization of agriculture, and to rapidly advance all sectors of consumer goods production. Ensuring the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society by continuously increasing and perfecting socialist production on a highly technical basis is the basic economic law of socialism. The supreme goal of all activities of the Communist Party is to make the people happy and prosperous. Only by implementing the Party's general line aimed at accelerating the development of heavy industry is it possible to ensure the continued development of all sectors of agriculture, light industry, and the food industry, and to ensure the continuous improvement of the material welfare of the working people.
    As for our prospects, the Party, faithful to Leninism, will continue to consistently implement its general line, which aims to continuously improve the entire social production, prioritize the development of the production of the means of production, mainly the rapid development of the fuel, steel, electricity, machine manufacturing, chemical, and construction industries. The vital interests of the people and the socialist state require this.
    In this regard, it is particularly important to systematically increase our power generation capacity and accelerate the development of the machine manufacturing industry. Lenin said: "If Russia is covered with a dense network of power stations and powerful technical equipment, then our communist economic construction will become an example for the future socialist Europe and Asia."
    The working class, our scientists, engineers, and technicians are implementing Lenin's electrification plan. In the four years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan alone, approximately five hundred power stations have been built and expanded, not counting small power stations. The power generation capacity put into production in 1954 alone almost reached two and a half times the power generation capacity put into production in the first ten years of the implementation of Lenin's All-Russian Electrification Plan. This year, the world's largest hydroelectric power station—the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station with a designed power generation capacity of 2.1 million kilowatts—will begin partial production and supply electricity for industrial use. In recent years, many large hydroelectric power stations will be built on the large rivers of Siberia, each of which will exceed the famous Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station several times in power generation capacity.
    The machine manufacturing industry is the heart of heavy industry, and it arms all sectors of the national economy with new technology. The latest machine technology equipment is the foundation of technological progress. Lenin taught us: "Machines must be used more widely and everywhere, and we must transition to the widest possible use of machine technology." The Party requires our scientists, engineers, and technicians not to be complacent, to always be at the forefront of the new achievements of world science and technology, to more widely apply advanced technology to the national economy, to continuously improve and promote Soviet science and technology, and to resolutely struggle against any backwardness, conservatism, and adherence to old ways.
    Lenin repeatedly pointed out that it is necessary to use all the knowledge and all the cultural wealth accumulated by mankind to build communism. Patriots are not those who often love to talk vaguely about the motherland and superiority, but in fact do not advance and stick to conventions. True patriots should absorb the most advanced experience in our country in their work, absorb the experience of the whole world in the business sectors they are engaged in, so as to ensure that Soviet science and technology actually occupy a priority position, strive for technological progress, and strive to achieve higher production indicators.
    Comrades! The Party pays special attention to agricultural issues when solving the major and complex task of building a powerful and comprehensive material production base for communism. It is impossible to solve the task of further rapidly developing light industry and the food industry without a rapid increase in agriculture, and the Party has always paid close attention to this task.
    Marx and Engels once predicted that agriculture liberated from the shackles of private ownership "will enter a period of prosperity and give society a completely sufficient amount of products." Our socialist agriculture is now approaching such a stage of development that if the full potential of agriculture is correctly utilized, it can give society a completely sufficient amount of products. The January Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union put forward the task of increasing the annual output of grain to no less than 10 billion poods and doubling or more than doubling the output of major livestock products by 1960. The resolution of the January Plenary Session is a complete, scientifically based, and feasible program for solving this huge national economic task.
    In order to implement the resolution of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the first requirement is a tense struggle to rapidly increase the grain yield per unit area and the total harvest of all cultivated land, and also to seriously reduce losses during the harvest of crops. Reclaiming 28 million to 30 million hectares of wasteland before 1956 can greatly expand our grain economy, which is the basis of all agricultural production sectors, and can provide other sectors with large tracts of land wealth that have been abandoned for a long time, because land is the main means of production in agriculture.
    The Party has pointed out the simplest and most effective way to increase grain production: greatly changing the structure of sown areas and increasing the sown area of ​​corn to at least 28 million hectares by 1960. It is worth noting that as early as 1921, Lenin had already pointed out the significant advantages of corn. In a letter to G.M. Krzhizhanovsky, Lenin requested "the formulation of some very precise and very thorough measures to carry out the propaganda of planting corn and to teach farmers the technology of planting corn..."
    Rapidly increasing corn production is the key to greatly developing the grain economy, and developing the grain economy is the only reliable way to solve the livestock industry problem, to solve the problem of having sufficient agricultural products in our country, and to solve the problem of having sufficient raw materials in light industry and the food industry. The strength and wisdom of the resolution of the January Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union lies here. The great patriotic enthusiasm of collective farmers, machine tractor stations, and state farm workers, as well as the experience of advanced farms, are the guarantee that the tasks put forward by the January Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union can be completed ahead of schedule and will inevitably be completed ahead of schedule.
    In the struggle to further develop agricultural productive forces, the Communist Party has recently taken a number of important measures that are in line with Lenin's principles of managing large-scale socialist production.
    Lenin taught that to build communism, it is necessary to combine the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses with the personal material interests of each worker in increasing production. The Party implemented a series of measures to stimulate the personal material interests of collective farm members, machine tractor stations, and state farm workers in increasing agricultural products. The Party requires that this powerful lever for increasing public wealth be improved in the future.
    In this regard, the recent reform of the agricultural planning system has great progressive significance. The Party and the government abolished the bureaucratic, overly exaggerated, and unrealistic agricultural planning system, because this system bound the initiative of collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms, and weakened their sense of responsibility and interest in developing agricultural production.
    Lenin pointed out: "The agriculture of Kaluga Province is obviously different from the agriculture of Kazan Province. The same is true in all industries. The same is true for the entire administrative aspect or management agency. In all such problems, if local characteristics are not taken into account, it will fall into bureaucratic centralization and so on, and will prevent local workers from estimating local differences, which is the basis of reasonable work."
    The new agricultural product planning system, starting from commodity production, is giving play to the initiative of collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms, and is encouraging them to strive to obtain the maximum amount of products from every hundred hectares of land. This new system combines the interests of collective farms and collective farm members, machine tractor stations, and state farm workers with the interests of the state and the whole people in the best way.
    Comrades! Our country has tens of thousands of collective farms that have set excellent examples of managing large-scale socialist agricultural production. In such collective farms, public property is increasing year by year, and the production of commercial grain is increasing year by year. In such collective farms, the income of the members is high, and cultural life is very active.
    However, in addition to advanced collective farms, we also have backward and economically weak collective farms. Experience has shown that the economic situation of a collective farm depends almost entirely on the person who leads the collective farm. As long as the chairman of the farm is an excellent chairman, then any collective farm, even the most backward collective farm, can become an advanced enterprise in one or two years. It is precisely because of this that when the task of eliminating agricultural backwardness is now put forward so that all collective farms can reach the level of advanced, highly commercial collective farms, the Central Committee of the Party and the Soviet government called for helping the collective farm countryside and strengthening backward collective farms with leading cadres.
    Organizer of large-scale socialist agricultural production—this is a glorious title. Actively participating in solving this historical task, turning all collective farms in our country into materially prosperous, culturally prosperous, and highly commercial flourishing farms is a great honor for every Soviet patriot. Yo·Vi·Stalin once pointed out: "If all collective farm members, all members and not just the majority of members, work sincerely, the collective farms will be piled with products, piled with all kinds of wealth, and then our country will become the richest country in the world."
    Our Communist Party is now solving such a task. It will certainly be able to solve this task in the shortest possible time.
    Comrades! The great Lenin taught the Party never to be intoxicated with the achievements that have been made, but to focus its main attention on the problems that have not yet been solved.
    The powerful and creative Soviet state is constantly moving forward in all aspects of the economy and culture. Before the revolution, Russia ranked fifth in the world in the total output of milled iron and steel, sixth in coal output, and fifteenth in electricity production. Today, the Soviet Union surpasses all capitalist countries except the United States in all these sectors, and ranks second in world production.
    But we have not yet solved the basic economic task of the Soviet Union put forward by Lenin—to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries. In Yo·Vi·Stalin's report to the Eighteenth Party Congress and in the resolutions of the Congress, it was pointed out that only when we surpass the major capitalist countries in terms of per capita output can we have abundant products, and can we transition from the first stage of communism to the next stage.
    In the economic competition between the two opposing systems, all advantages are on the side of the young socialist economic system. Indeed, if we compare the economic development speed of the Soviet Union with that of the major capitalist countries, we can see that: in the recent twenty-five years, the average annual growth rate of industrial output in the Soviet Union (excluding the war years) is 18.2%, the United States is 2.4%, the United Kingdom is 3.6%, and France is 2.1%. In other words, the socialist economy is developing much faster than the capitalist economy. The law that plays a role in the socialist economy is the law of planned (proportional) development of the national economy. There is no anarchy of production, no destructive competition, and no devastating economic crisis inherent in capitalism. There are no hostile classes here, and there is no parasitic consumption of the exploiting classes. The entire Soviet people are the producers and controllers of all social wealth, and their interests are closely related to the continuous growth of social production. Based on this, we have scientific reason to firmly believe that the basic economic task of the Soviet Union will be victoriously solved in a very short historical period.
    In the struggle to solve the basic economic task and to create truly abundant products in our country, resolutely improving social labor productivity is of paramount importance. Lenin taught: "Improving labor productivity is one of the fundamental tasks, because it is impossible to finally transition to communism without doing this." At present, the level of labor productivity in the Soviet Union cannot meet the needs of the growing national economy and is not adapted to the technical equipment of our national economy. The issue now is not about individual records. The current task is: to rely on socialist competition, a powerful driving force for the development of our society, to fully utilize the most abundant technology, to correctly organize labor, to strive to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and to realize the historic resolutions of the January Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and to ensure the continuous and greatly improvement of labor productivity in every enterprise, every workshop, every state farm, or collective farm. With the victory of the October Revolution, the people, for the first time in history, became the masters of their own destiny. Leninism's starting point is to recognize the decisive role of the masses of the people as the true creators of history. Lenin taught:
   "Only those who believe in the people, only those who are immersed in the source of the living creativity of the people, can triumph and seize power." The Communist Party is flesh and blood with the people. The socialist system, as a true system of popular government, embodies the indivisible unity of the Party, the state, and the people.
    In order to victoriously solve the major and complex tasks of communist construction, the Party requires continuous improvement of state organs. Lenin believed that the most important task of the Soviet regime was to "continuously streamline the Soviet organs by reducing the Soviet organs, improving the organization, eliminating procrastination and bureaucracy, and reducing non-productive expenditures."
    According to the principles of the work of the Soviet organs formulated by Lenin, the Communist Party has always implemented the policy of continuously increasing the labor force in the scope of material production, that is, in the scope of creating all the wealth of life. The Party is resolutely striving to streamline state organs, to concentrate their work on living organizational work, rather than on compiling reports and resolutions. The Party requires all links of the state organs to earnestly implement the policies of the Communist Party—the most advanced and vital policies in the world. The Party has carried out a resolute struggle against a casual attitude towards social wealth, petty-bourgeois sloppiness, selfishness, greed, and other manifestations of bourgeois morality. The Party constantly cares about the development of science and culture.
    The Soviet system born of the Great October Socialist Revolution is increasingly showing its powerful vitality. In every corner of the Soviet land, the wellspring of people's creation is boiling. The creative activities of the Soviet people in economic, cultural, and state construction are of world historical significance, because the Soviet Union is the spokesperson of the great liberation thought of mankind, and the standard-bearer of the new communist era. × × ×
    Comrades! Lenin made an extremely profound analysis of the laws of modern capitalism, and he proved that imperialism is parasitic and decadent capitalism, the eve of socialist revolution. The deepening general crisis of capitalism has enveloped all aspects of capitalism, including both the economy and politics. The most important characteristics of this crisis are: the world is divided into two systems, socialism and capitalism; the world capitalist system is accelerating its disintegration and more and more countries are constantly breaking away from the capitalist system; the world socialist system is steadily growing and developing, and its power is constantly strengthening.
    Elucidating the path of historical development in the decades that followed, Lenin pointed out: "The elimination of capitalism and its traces, and the laying of the foundation of the communist system, is the content of the new historical period of the world that is beginning now." Experience has fully confirmed the full correctness of Lenin's predictions. Lenin's thought has truly become the dominant thought of progressive humanity. This thought has a powerful influence on the entire course of world history.
    The intensification of contradictions between labor and capital, between imperialist countries, and between suzerain states and colonies is undermining the foundations of the imperialist system. The parasitism of modern capitalism, especially American capitalism, is becoming increasingly obvious. Frequent under-capacity operation of enterprises and frequent mass unemployment, the unbalanced development between production potential and the constantly shrinking purchasing power of residents, widespread economic militarization, the great increase in bourgeois profits and waste, and the unprecedented deepening of the poverty of the working class and the bankruptcy of farmers, all inevitably lead to devastating economic crises.
    The United States has become a usurious country, implementing a policy of enslaving and consistently plundering the people of other countries. It is now one of the important sources of the disintegration of the entire capitalist economy. A major country in the capitalist world has become the main center of capitalist economic turmoil. Due to the action of insurmountable internal forces, the world capitalist system is collapsing. In Europe, a number of countries with approximately half of the total population of Europe have finally freed themselves from capitalism and joined the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. In countries like France and Italy, the Communist Party is leading millions of working people forward, which is not only an important factor in the domestic life of these countries, but also an important factor in the entire situation in Europe. The German people's struggle against the evil policy of turning West Germany into a breeding ground for the Third World War and for the establishment of a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany is intensifying. Therefore, the ancient imperialist Europe is undergoing a profound and growing crisis.
    The ambitious transoceanic schemers who covet world hegemony are trying to turn Europe, with its freedom-loving traditions and invaluable cultural treasures, into a dependency of the American Empire. These attempts are doomed to complete bankruptcy. A new, free, and socialist Europe has been born and is growing and becoming stronger. It is the legitimate heir to all the material and spiritual wealth accumulated by all nations for thousands of years as prescribed by history. It contains the infinite power to prosper the economy and culture, and to promote human individuality. The future belongs to it.
    But the crisis of capitalism is not limited to Europe. An integral part of the general crisis of capitalism is the increasing expansion and deepening of the disintegration of the imperialist colonial system. Lenin was the greatest theorist of the colonial-national question. Lenin's name and Lenin's doctrine are the symbol and banner of the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and the entire East against imperialist oppression and racial oppression, and for national freedom and national independence. Lenin linked the rapid acceleration of the historical development that has come to pass with the following facts: countries like China and India are boiling, and batch after batch of hundreds of millions of people have joined the most powerful movement, which even the most powerful imperialist countries are powerless to resist. Eastern countries "...have been drawn into the vortex of development that cannot but cause a crisis in world capitalism." Life has fully confirmed this prediction.
    After the October Socialist Revolution, the victory of the 600 million Chinese people over the joint forces of foreign imperialism and domestic feudal reactionaries was a victory of socialism of world historical significance, and the most serious defeat of imperialism. This victory fundamentally changed the situation in Asia and the Pacific and the entire international situation. The scope of colonial exploitation was suddenly reduced by about one-third. The free and great Chinese people are engaged in a victorious struggle for the industrialization of their country and for the establishment of a socialist foundation. Their creative activities have won the praise of all progressive mankind and have inspired the wisdom and minds of hundreds of millions of people in the colonial East.
    At the same time, India, Indonesia, and Burma have also broken away from the old colonial system. The ongoing Asian-African Conference (which represents 1.6 billion people from Asia and Africa) proves that every Eastern country has its own characteristics in terms of economic and social movement forms. But the desire to completely get rid of the disasters of imperialist colonial policy and the desire for peace, freedom, and independence unite all these countries. The myth about the omnipotence of imperialism has been permanently eliminated in the colonial countries. The reactionary conspiracy of world imperialism, primarily the United States as an international gendarme, to strangle the Asian countries' people's fearless struggle for their freedom and independence is suffering one failure after another.
    Thinkers in the imperialist camp who are limited by a narrow bourgeois worldview attempt to portray the profound changes taking place on the world stage as being caused by the "subversive forces" of the Communists trying to seize power everywhere, or as a result of some kind of external interference.
    Lenin said: "The rule of capitalism is overthrown not because someone wants to seize power. 'Seizing' power is an absurd saying. If the entire economic development of capitalist countries has not reached such a degree, it is impossible to end the rule of capitalism. ... If history has not washed away and destroyed capitalism, no force can destroy capitalism..."
    But it is precisely because history has washed away and destroyed capitalism, because capitalism has developed to the limit, that there is no force in the world that can stop the law-governed process of socialism replacing capitalism. Lenin said that this process is unstoppable, because, apart from socialism, there is no way to save mankind from war and hunger, and to save hundreds of millions of people from death.
    As a result of this law-governed process of social development, there are now two world social systems on the international stage: the world socialist system and the world capitalist system. The great camp of peace, democracy, and socialism unites 900 million people, more than one-third of the world's population. The experience of the Soviet Union, Europe, and the people's democratic countries of Asia proves unequivocally that in all places where the people manage the country, where all forces and wealth are used to serve the interests of the people, the endless human forces and creativity can be liberated, bold ideals and ambitious plans can be realized, and the continuous growth of the economy, culture, and people's welfare will become the law of development there.
    Different foreign policy directions are adapted to different social systems.
    In foreign policy, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all people's democratic countries are implementing Lenin's great principle: resolutely and consistently defending world peace. Leninism's starting point is that peaceful coexistence of different socio-economic systems is possible and necessary. The establishment of a certain social and political system in a country is the internal affair of the people of that country. The Soviet Union never interferes in the affairs of other countries. It consistently implements its own foreign policy. The implementation of the great plan to build a communist society will take many years, even decades, so it requires the consolidation and lasting world peace. The struggle for peace is the basis of the international policy of socialist countries. The Soviet Union is the main bulwark of peace, and the spokesperson of the friendship of all nations, and the freedom and independence of the people of large and small countries.
    The great Lenin taught that socialism should and will show its superiority over capitalism in economic competition. The Soviet people are convinced that socialism, which has already proven its decisive superiority over capitalism in practice, will eventually defeat capitalism in the course of peaceful economic competition. The Soviet state has put forward this competition to the old capitalist world since the first days of its founding. The Soviet Union is still true to Lenin's principles in this regard.
    Of course, economic competition determines that trade should be universally developed on mutually beneficial terms. Trade exchange can be fruitfully supplemented by cultural ties. This is the realistic basis for the peaceful coexistence of socialism and capitalism. A unified collective security system can be fully established and grow on this basis, and this collective security system, which includes all countries with different social systems, will guarantee lasting and solid peace.
    In contrast to the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy direction is the aggressive policy of the United States and its vassal states. It can be seen from the entire current policy of the imperialists that they are leading the situation towards a new war. The so-called "position of strength" policy is nothing more than openly betting on a new world war of bloodshed. The "position of strength" policy is nothing new, it is entirely copied from the Hitlerites. Everyone knows that it was Hitler and his accomplices who took the following words as the unchanging creed of international relations: "I implement a policy of strength, regardless of what hypocrisy or honor." "In foreign policy...only the logic of strength plays a role." "The world can only be managed with terror."
    In the past, the German fascists bet on the "policy of strength," which meant they decided to launch the Second World War. Now, some reactionary figures in the United States bet on the "policy of strength," which means they are openly preparing for the Third World War.
    The system of military-political blocs established by the reactionary figures in the United States serves the strategy of aggression. The North Atlantic Group is the center of this system. It is now very clear that the military alliance between the United States and West Germany plays a major lever role in this group. This alliance will rely on the military-industrial potential of the economic system of the "Schuman Plan," that is, on the Ruhr area, which has been consolidated and strengthened by sacrificing the resources of France, Belgium, and Italy. This is the true essence of the so-called Paris Accords, because the Paris Accords not only want to revive the German militarist machine, but also intend to create the most favorable conditions for the realization of the German militarist revenge plan. The military aggressive groups of the so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" and the Pakistan-Turkey Group and the Turkey-Iraq Group, which are tools for the United States and Britain to implement imperialist plans in the Arab East, are branches of the North Atlantic Group. The United States has established an extensive network of military bases, and it has deployed these bases with the aim of trying to threaten the Soviet

    列宁的思想照耀着通向共产主义的大道
    ——在莫斯科党组织、苏维埃和群众组织纪念列宁诞生八十五周年大会上的报告
    “真理报”总编辑  德·特·谢皮洛夫
    同志们，苏联和各人民民主国家的劳动人民、资本主义和殖民地世界的工人阶级、全体进步人类都在纪念一个难忘的节日——弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁诞生八十五周年。
    列宁是革命理论和革命行动的巨人，共产党的伟大创立者，世界上第一个苏维埃社会主义国家的父亲，世界各国劳动人民的领袖。
    卡尔·马克思和弗里德里希·恩格斯这两位工人阶级的伟大导师和理论家以真正科学的世界观武装了工人阶级。他们发现了资本主义产生、发展和灭亡的法则，科学地论证了社会主义革命的不可避免性。他们揭示了工人阶级作为资本主义掘墓人和社会主义社会创建者的历史性作用。他们概括地叙述了共产主义发展的两个阶段。从最深刻的创造性的革命的意义上说，列宁是正统的马克思主义者，他在很大程度上丰富了马克思主义的思想宝库。
    列宁是在一个新的时代出现在政治斗争的舞台上的，当时资本主义正在从它的垄断前的阶段转入帝国主义阶段。当时，资本主义的矛盾在俄国表现得特别尖锐。世界解放运动的中心正转向这里。最伟大的革命斗争酝酿成熟的地方正是这里。给世界贡献了列宁的也正是俄国。它是列宁主义的故乡。
    同时，列宁主义是深深地扎根于国际发展和全世界的解放运动中的。列宁主义是一种国际性的学说。列宁主义是帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义，是建设共产主义时代的马克思主义。它集中了有史以来人类智慧的大成。在光辉地总结这一新的历史时期内全世界范围的经验的基础上，列宁发展了和丰富了马克思主义哲学——辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，以及马克思主义政治经济学。列宁主义是俄国文化和世界文化的最高成就。
    列宁是伟大的革命战略家。列宁用他那种思想家的深刻的洞察力发掘出了资本主义生产方式内在的发展过程，他是研究帝国主义的杰出著作的作者。他在发现了帝国主义时期资本主义国家经济和政治发展的不平衡的法则以后，创造了新的、完整的社会主义革命理论，这一理论是照亮全体被压迫人类走向新生活的道路的伟大十月社会主义革命的旗帜和理论基础。
    列宁写道：“我们有权感到骄傲，有权认为自己是幸运的，因为我们是第一个在世界的一部分打倒资本主义野兽的人。资本主义把人类淹没在血泊里，它使人类陷于饥馑和野蛮的状态；资本主义必然要灭亡，而且很快就要灭亡，不管它的激烈的垂死挣扎的表现多么残酷而可怕。”
    在我们眼前，旧的、日趋没落的世界资本主义制度正在日益分崩离析，而新的、上升的世界社会主义制度正在不断发展和日益壮大。二十世纪是战无不胜的马克思列宁主义思想胜利的世纪。
    列宁是伟大的科学泰斗。列宁发现了对社会进行社会主义改造的法则、方法和形式，发现了建设共产主义的法则，从而把马克思主义提到了更高的水平。他全面地阐明了无产阶级专政的问题，论证了无产阶级专政的最高原则是由工人阶级起领导作用的工农联盟这一基本原理。他创造了民族——殖民地问题的理论。他阐明了建设社会主义和共产主义的最重要的经济问题。强大的多民族的苏维埃国家——苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟——活生生地体现了列宁主义思想的伟大的改造力量。
    列宁兼有伟大的思想家和政治战士、革命变革的大师和亿万群众的组织者的品质。在俄国无产阶级革命运动刚开始时，列宁就说：“给我们一个革命家组织，我们就能把俄国翻转过来”。他创立了、在思想上锻炼了和培养了我们光荣的共产党这样一个革命家的组织。
    列宁主义的党在三次革命的社会斗争中站在工人阶级的前列。党在内战和帝国主义干涉年代中，领导苏联人民进行了维护自己国家的自由和独立的忘我的斗争。在反对孟什维克、托洛茨基分子、右派资本主义复辟者、人民的形形色色的敌人的激烈斗争中，党在列宁事业的伟大继承人约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林领导下，克服了最大的艰难困苦，领导我国走到社会主义的胜利。苏联人民和他们英勇的武装部队在党的领导之下，在伟大卫国战争中击溃了装备精良的希特勒侵略军，从法西斯奴役的威胁下拯救了全世界。
    今天，共产党在列宁的杰出的战友们和学生们的领导下，正在鼓舞着和组织着我国人民从事建设共产主义社会的伟大建设性的劳动。列宁主义过去是，现在和将来都是党的战斗的胜利的旗帜。
    同志们！苏联人民在按照社会主义路线从事社会改造的时候，最初曾经不得不依赖过去遗留下来的极其落后的经济。
    列宁依据社会主义有可能首先在一国胜利的新的革命学说，科学地拟定了在我国建设社会主义社会的计划。这个计划的组成部分是：（一）国家的社会主义工业化，（二）在农户的生产合作的基础上对农业进行社会主义改造，（三）文化革命。列宁指出，我们有一切必要的条件来建立一个真正强大的、富裕的社会主义国家。
    早在一九一七年，列宁就向党和人民提出了一个巨大的任务——在一个很短的历史时期内以全力向前迈进和消除俄国技术上和经济上的落后性。
    列宁教导我们说：规模巨大的机器工业、生产资料的生产，是社会主义的物质基础。共产党以这个列宁主义的计划为指针，在斯大林领导下，在社会主义工业化的基础上对苏联经济进行了根本的改造。列宁的思想一掌握了群众，就变成了一种强大的物质力量。苏维埃国家完成了一次巨大的飞跃，从落后变成了先进。苏联在不到二十年的时间内走完了发展工业的道路，而资本主义世界最老的国家英国，从工业革命起在这上面花了差不多两个世纪，美国花了大约一个世纪。今天苏联已是一个强大的工业国家了。一九五四年苏联大工业的总产量，为一九一三年的水平的三十五倍（按比较价格计算），生产资料的生产差不多为六十倍，发电量七十五倍，机器制造业的生产量一百六十倍以上。这些数字显示出了社会主义计划经济制度的极大优越性。
    同志们！马克思和恩格斯非常敏锐地预见到在无产阶级革命胜利后对农业进行社会主义改造的必要性。但是，他们自然无法制订这种改造的具体纲领，也没有向自己提出过制订这种纲领的任务。这样一个深刻的对最广大的农民群众具有吸引力的英明纲领是在列宁的合作社计划中提出来的。
    列宁教导说，在无产阶级取得了对资产阶级的阶级胜利、在生产资料公有之下的有教养的合作社社员制度，这就是社会主义制度。“把这个最落后的生产形式——农业——放在新的轨道上，以改造它并且把耕作业从古老的、未开化的方法来进行的生产方式转变为以科学和技术的成就为基础的生产方式”，乃是我们的义务和职责。
    用列宁的合作社计划武装起来的共产党，依靠着日益增长的社会主义工业的力量，引导着工人阶级、千百万农民群众在农村中进行了这一伟大的改造工作。
    世界社会发展史上从来没有过像十月革命之后全盘集体化和消灭富农阶级所做到那样广泛和深刻的改造生产基础、改造千百万人的生活方式的变化。代替农村中旧的私有制及其小商品生产者分化和群众痛苦的长年历史，一个新的、前所未有的集体农庄制度已经创立起来了。这个制度已经消灭了农民中间的差别、富农的奴役和农村里的痛苦和贫困；它为农业生产力的发展，为集体农民的物质福利和文化水平的提高开辟了无限的前途。集体农庄制度是苏联人民最伟大的成就之一。
    完成国家工业化，完成农业集体化，在这个基础上消灭剥削阶级和产生人剥削人现象的真正根源，完成深刻的文化革命，在各民族自愿联盟、兄弟般信任和互助的基础上建立一个多民族的国家；所有这些都意味着伟大的列宁的计划——把俄国变成一个强大的社会主义国家——的完全胜利。
    苏联人民对他们的伟大成就是有理由感到自豪的。但是党要求苏联人民毫不动摇地沿着科学的共产主义的纲领所指出的道路继续前进。列宁主义是永远富有生命力和生气勃勃的学说。
    列宁在社会主义革命还处于摇篮时代的时候就说：“在进行社会主义改革的时候，我们必须清楚地注视着这些改革最后所指向的目标，那就是建立共产主义社会……”
    列宁主义是指南针，是使我们的党能够在极其复杂的社会发展法则中正确地确定方向、认识历史事件之间的内在联系、预见这些历史事件的发展进程并满怀信心地领导人民群众的有力的思想武器。
    要完成社会主义的建设和逐渐过渡到共产主义的第二阶段，就必须先要在先进技术的基础上不断地大大地发展社会主义社会的生产力，实现整个国民经济的电气化，完成国民经济各部门的劳动的全部机械化，实行广泛的生产自动化和化学化。整个社会生产的这种蓬勃的高涨完全是建立在加速发展重工业的基础上的。
    有些苏维埃工作者和科学工作者认为在今天的条件下，迅速发展重工业已经没有必要，现在应把主要的重心转移到轻工业的问题上去。党已经揭露了他们的这种观点的伪科学性，在政治上的害处和反列宁主义的本质。这是一个使我国人民解除武装的腐朽理论。如果付诸实施，它就会削弱整个国民经济，降低劳动人民的生活水平和破坏社会主义国家的防御能力。
    列宁曾经指出：“大规模的机器工业是社会主义的唯一可能的物质基础。谁忘记这一点，谁就不是共产主义者。”列宁把优先发展重工业和生产资料的生产叫做经济法则。如果这条法则对资本主义来说是有效的话，那么，它对于社会主义就具有绝对的、大一百倍的意义，因为一个成熟的社会主义社会必须在工业发展的水平上远远超过任何国家，那怕是最发达的资本主义国家。
    重工业过去是，而且要继续是社会主义经济的基石和它的骨干。只有在迅速发展重工业的基础上才有可能实现生产力的蓬勃高涨，才有可能进一步巩固国家的经济力量和国防力量，才有可能完成农业的广泛机械化，才有可能使生产消费品的各个部门急速地向前发展。用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要，乃是社会主义的基本经济法则。共产党的一切活动的最高目标就是要使人民得到幸福和繁荣。只有执行旨在加速发展重工业的党的总路线，才有可能保证农业的一切部门、轻工业和食品工业继续向前发展，才有可能保证劳动人民物质福利的不断提高。
    至于我们的前景，忠于列宁主义的党将继续始终如一地执行它的总路线，这个总路线的目的就是不断地提高整个社会生产，优先发展生产资料的生产，主要的是迅速发展燃料、钢铁、电力、机器制造、化学和建筑工业。人民和社会主义国家的切身利益要求这样做。
    在这方面特别重要的是有计划地增加我们的发电能力，加速发展机器制造业。列宁说：“如果俄国布满了密密的发电站和强大的技术装备网，那么，我们的共产主义经济建设将成为未来的社会主义欧洲和亚洲的榜样。”
    工人阶级，我们的科学家、工程师和技术员实现着列宁的电气化计划。仅在第五个五年计划的四年内，就兴建和扩建了约五百个发电站，小型发电站还不计算在内。在一九五四年一年中投入生产的发电能力几乎达到实行列宁的全俄电气化计划的头十年所投入生产的发电能力的两倍半。今年，世界上最大的水电站——设计发电能力为二百一十万瓩的古比雪夫水电站将开始部分投入生产，并供给工业用电。最近几年，西伯利亚的一些大河上将建筑许多大水电站，其中每一个水电站的发电能力都将超过著名的第聂伯水电站数倍。
    机器制造业是重工业的心脏，它用新式技术武装国民经济的一切部门。最新的机器技术设备是技术进步的基础。列宁教导我们说：“必须更广泛地到处运用机器，必需过渡到尽量广泛地采用机器技术。”党要求我们的科学家、工程师和技术员不要骄傲自满，要经常居于世界科学技术新成就的前列，更广泛地把先进技术运用到国民经济中去，不断地改良和推进苏联的科学和技术，同任何落后、保守和因循的现象作坚决的斗争。
    列宁多次地指出，必须利用人类累积下来的全部知识和一切文化财富来建设共产主义。爱国者并不是那些经常爱泛泛地空谈祖国和优越性而事实上并不前进、墨守成规的人。真正的爱国者应该在自己的工作中吸取我国最先进的经验，在自己所从事的业务部门方面吸取全世界的经验，以保证苏联的科学和技术在实际上占优先的地位，努力为技术进步而奋斗，争取达到更高的生产指标。
    同志们！党在解决建立共产主义的强大和全面发展的物质生产基础这一重大而复杂的任务时，特别注意农业问题。农业不迅速提高，就不可能解决进一步迅速发展轻工业和食品工业的任务，而党过去和现在都是时时刻刻地注意着这一任务的。
    马克思和恩格斯曾经预言说，从私有的束缚中解放出来的农业“将进入繁荣时期和给社会以完全足够数量的产品”。我国的社会主义农业现在已经临近这样一个发展阶段，即如果农业的全部潜力得到正确的利用，它就能给社会以完全足够数量的产品。苏共中央一月全会提出了要在一九六零年以前使谷物的年产量达到不少于一百亿普特并使畜牧业的主要产品产量增为两倍或两倍以上的任务，一月全会的决议是解决这一巨大的国民经济任务的一个完整的、有科学根据的和切实可行的纲领。
    为了实现苏共中央全会的决议，首先要求紧张的奋斗，争取迅速提高所有耕地的谷物单位面积产量和总收获量，还要求认真地减低在收割庄稼时的损失。在一九五六年以前开垦二千八百万至三千万公顷的荒地，这可以大大地扩大我国作为一切农业生产部门的基础的谷物经济，并且可以给其他各部门提供荒废了很久的大片的土地财富，因为土地是农业中的主要的生产资料。
    党指出了最简捷和最有效的提高谷物生产的道路：大大地改变播种面积的结构，在一九六零年以前把玉蜀黍播种面积至少增加到二千八百万公顷。值得注意的是，早在一九二一年，列宁就已经指出玉蜀黍的重大优越性。列宁在给格·马·克兰日让诺夫斯基的信中要求“制订一些十分精确和十分周到的措施，以进行种植玉蜀黍的宣传和教导农民种植玉蜀黍的技术……”
    急速增产玉蜀黍，这是大大发展谷物经济的关键，而发展谷物经济则是解决畜牧业问题、解决使我国有充足的农产品、使轻工业食品工业有充足的原料的问题的唯一可靠的道路。苏共中央一月全会的决议的力量和英明就在这里。集体农民、机器拖拉机站和国营农场工作人员的伟大爱国热情以及先进农场的经验，都是苏共中央一月全会所提出的任务可以提前完成而且必将提前完成的保证。
    共产党在争取进一步发展农业生产力的斗争中，最近采取了许多重要的措施，这些措施都是符合列宁关于经营社会主义大生产的原则的。
    列宁教导说，要建设共产主义，就必须把群众的革命热情同每一个工作人员在增加生产方面的个人物质利益结合起来。党实施一系列的措施，以刺激集体农庄庄员、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员在增加农产品方面的个人物质利益。党要求今后继续改进这种增加公共财富的强大杠杆。
    在这方面，不久以前实行的农业计划制度的改革有着重大的进步意义。党和政府废除了官僚主义式的、非常夸张的和脱离实际的农业计划制度，因为这种制度束缚了集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的主动性，减弱了它们对于发展农业生产的责任心和兴趣。
    列宁指出：“加路格省的农业与嘉桑省的农业显然不同。在全部工业中也有同样的情形。对于整个行政方面或管理机关也是如此。在这样的一切问题中，若不估计到地方特点，就会陷入官僚主义的集中制等等，就会妨碍地方工作人员去估计地方区别，这种估计乃是合理工作的基础。”
    以商品生产为出发点的新的农产品计划制度正在发挥集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的主动精神，使它们努力争取从每一百公顷土地上获得最大限度的产品。这个新制度以最好的方式把集体农庄和集体农庄庄员、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员的利益同国家和全民的利益结合起来。
    同志们！我国有数以万计的集体农庄作出了经营社会主义大农业生产的优良范例。在这样的集体农庄里，公有财产在一年一年地增加，商品粮食的生产在一年一年地增加。在这样的集体农庄里，庄员的收入很高，文化生活非常活跃。
    但是，除了先进集体农庄以外，我们还有落后的、经济薄弱的集体农庄。经验证明，某一集体农庄的经济状况是好是坏，几乎完全取决领导这个集体农庄的人。只要农庄的主席是一个优秀的主席，那么任何一个集体农庄，甚至最落后的集体农庄也可以在一两年之内变成先进的企业。正因为如此，所以当现在提出了消灭农业落后现象以便使一切集体农庄都达到先进的、商品产量很高的集体农庄水平这样一个任务的时候，党中央委员会和苏联政府号召帮助集体农庄乡村，号召以领导干部去加强落后的集体农庄。
    社会主义大农业生产的组织者——这是一个光荣的称号。积极地参与解决这个历史性的任务，把我国一切集体农庄变成物质上富裕的、文化上繁荣的、具有高度商品产量的欣欣向荣的农庄，这是每一个苏联爱国者的巨大荣誉。约·维·斯大林曾经指出：“假如一切集体农庄庄员，一切庄员而不仅仅是大多数庄员，都诚恳地工作，集体农庄就将堆满产品，堆满一切财富，这时，我们的国家就会成为世界上最富有的国家。”
    我们的共产党现在正是要解决这样的任务。它一定能在最短时期内解决这个任务。
    同志们！伟大的列宁教导党永远不要陶醉于已取得的成就，而要把主要的注意力集中在还没有解决的问题上。
    充满威力和创造力的苏维埃国家在经济文化各方面不断向前迈进。革命前俄国在铣铁和钢的生产总量方面占世界第五位，在煤产量方面占第六位，在电力生产方面占第十五位，苏联今天在所有这些部门超过了除美国以外的一切资本主义国家，而在世界生产中占第二位。
    但是我们还没有解决列宁所提出的苏联的基本经济任务——赶上并且超过最发达的资本主义国家。在约·维·斯大林在第十八次党代表大会上的报告中和大会的决议中指出，只有我们在按人口计算的生产量方面超过了主要的资本主义国家，我们方能有丰足的产品，我们才有可能从共产主义第一阶段过渡到第二阶段。
    在两个对立的制度的经济竞赛方面，一切优越性都是在年青的社会主义经济制度方面。的确，如果把苏联和主要的资本主义国家的经济发展速度比较一下的话，就可以看出：在最近二十五年中，苏联的工业生产量平均每年的增长速度（除战争年代以外）是百分之十八点二，美国是百分之二点四，英国是百分之三点六，法国是百分之二点一。换句话说，社会主义经济向前发展的速度要比资本主义经济的发展速度快得多。社会主义经济中起作用的法则是国民经济有计划的（按比例的）发展的法则。在我们这里没有生产无政府状态，没有破坏性的竞争和资本主义所固有的毁灭性的经济危机。我们这里没有敌对的阶级，没有剥削阶级的寄生性的消费。全体苏联人民就是一切社会财富的生产者和支配者，他们的利益是和社会生产的不断增长息息相关的。基于这一点，我们有科学根据地深信，苏联的基本经济任务在极短的历史时期内就将胜利地得到解决。
    在争取解决基本经济任务、争取在我国创造真正富裕的产品的斗争中，坚决提高社会劳动生产率具有头等重要的意义。列宁教导说：“提高劳动生产率是根本的任务之一，因为不做到这点，就不可能最后过渡到共产主义。”目前，苏联的劳动生产率的水平不能满足日益增长的国民经济的需要，不适应于我国国民经济的技术装备的情况。现在问题不在于个别的记录。目前的任务在于：依靠社会主义竞赛这样一个我们社会发展的强大动力，充分利用最丰富的技术和正确地组织劳动，来争取提前完成五年计划并实现苏共中央一月全会的历史性决议，保证每个企业、每个车间、每个国营农场或集体农庄的劳动生产率不断地和大大地提高。随着十月革命的胜利，人民破天荒第一次成了自己命运的主人。列宁主义的出发点是，承认作为历史的真正的创造者的人民群众的决定性作用。列宁教导说：
  “只有相信人民的人，只有沉浸在活生生的人民创造力的泉源中的人，才能胜利和取得政权。”共产主义者的政党是同人民血肉相连的。作为真正的民治制度的社会主义制度，体现了党、国家和人民的不可分割的团结。
    为了胜利地解决共产主义建设的重大而复杂的任务，党要求不断地改进国家机关。列宁认为，苏维埃政权的最重要的任务是“用缩减苏维埃机关，改善组织方式，消灭拖沓作风和官僚主义，减少非生产开支的办法来不断地精简苏维埃机关”。
    根据列宁制定的苏维埃机关工作的原则，共产党一直执行着不断增加物质生产范围内的劳动力，即在创造一切生活财富的范围内的劳动力的方针。党在坚决争取精简国家机关，使它的工作集中在活生生的组织工作上，而不是放在编制报告和决议上，党要求国家机关的各个环节认真执行共产党的政策——世界上最先进和有生命力的政策。党跟对社会财富采取漫不经心的态度、小资产阶级的散漫、自私、贪财和资产阶级道德的其他表现进行了坚决的斗争。党不断关心科学和文化的发展。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命所诞生的苏维埃制度在越来越大的程度上显示出它的强大的生命力。在苏维埃土地上的各个角落，人民创造的泉源都沸腾起来了。苏联人民在经济、文化和国家建设方面的创造性活动是有世界历史意义的，因为苏联是宣扬人类的伟大解放思想的代言人，是新的、共产主义时代的旗手。×　×　×
    同志们！列宁对现代资本主义的法则作了极深刻的分析，他证明了帝国主义是寄生的和腐朽的资本主义，是社会主义革命的前夜。日益加深的资本主义总危机已经笼罩了资本主义的一切方面，既包括经济，也包括政治。这一危机的最重要的特征是：世界分裂为社会主义和资本主义两种制度；世界资本主义制度加紧瓦解和越来越多的国家不断摆脱资本主义制度；世界社会主义制度稳步成长和发展，它的威力在不断加强。
    列宁在阐明其后数十年历史的发展道路时指出：“资本主义及其痕迹的消灭，以及共产主义制度基础的奠定，是从现在开始的世界历史新时期的内容”。经验完全证实了列宁的预言的全部正确性。列宁的思想真正成了进步人类的思想的主导者。这种思想对世界历史的整个进程有强有力的影响。
    劳动同资本之间的矛盾，帝国主义国家之间的矛盾以及宗主国同殖民地之间的矛盾的加深，破坏着帝国主义制度的基础。现代资本主义，首先是美国资本主义的寄生性愈来愈明显了。企业经常的开工不足和经常的大批失业，生产潜力同不断缩小的居民购买力之间的不平衡的发展，广泛的经济军事化，资产阶级利润和浪费行为的大大增长，工人阶级的贫困以及农民的破产的空前加深，这一切都不可避免地导向毁灭性的经济危机。
    美国成了一个放高利贷的国家，它执行着奴役和一贯掠夺其他国家人民的政策，它现在是整个资本主义经济瓦解的重要根源之一。资本主义世界的一个主要国家成了资本主义经济动荡的主要中心。由于不可克服的内部力量的作用，世界资本主义体系正在崩溃中。在欧洲，约拥有占欧洲总人口半数的许多国家最终挣脱了资本主义，而加入了和平、民主和社会主义阵营。在像法国、意大利这样一些国家里，共产党在领导着千百万的劳动群众前进，这不只是这些国家国内生活中的一个重要因素，而且是欧洲整个形势中的重要因素。德国人民反对变西德为第三次世界大战策源地的罪恶政策、争取建立统一、独立、民主和爱好和平的德国的斗争在日益加强。因此，古老的帝国主义的欧洲在经受着深刻的、日益增长的危机。
    大洋彼岸觊觎着世界霸权的野心家们，企图把具有爱好自由的传统、具有无可估价的文化宝藏的欧洲变为美利坚帝国的藩属。这些企图注定要完全破产。新的、自由的、社会主义的欧洲已经诞生，并且正在成长和壮大。它是历史所规定的各国人民几千年来所积累的全部物质和精神财富的合法继承人。它孕藏着繁荣经济和文化、发扬人的个性的无穷的力量。未来是属于它的。
    但是，资本主义的危机并不仅限于欧洲。资本主义总危机的一个组成部分是帝国主义殖民制度分崩离析的日益扩大和加深。列宁是殖民地—民族问题最伟大的理论家。列宁的名字、列宁的学说是亚洲、非洲、整个东方人民反对帝国主义压迫和种族压迫、争取民族自由和民族独立斗争的象征和旗帜。列宁把已经到来的历史发展速度的急速加快和下面这些事实联系起来：像中国、印度这样一些国家在沸腾着，一批又一批的成亿的人加入了最有实力的运动，这种运动连最强大的帝国主义国家也无力阻挡。东方国家“……已被卷入到不能不引起全世界资本主义危机的发展漩涡中去了”。生活完全证实了这一预言。
    十月社会主义革命以后，六亿中国人民对外国帝国主义和国内封建反动派的联合力量的胜利，是具有世界历史意义的社会主义的胜利，是帝国主义最严重的失败。这个胜利使亚洲和太平洋地区的局势以及整个国际局势起了根本的变化。殖民地剥削的范围一下子就缩小了约三分之一。自由的和伟大的中国人民为自己国家的工业化和为建立社会主义基础进行着胜利的斗争，他们的创造性活动获得了全体进步人类的赞扬，激发了殖民地东方亿万人的智慧和心灵。
    同时，印度、印度尼西亚和缅甸也摆脱了旧的殖民制度。正在举行中的亚非国家会议（这个会议代表着亚非两洲的十六亿人民）证明，每一个东方国家在经济上和社会运动的形式上都有着自己的特点。但是，对完全摆脱帝国主义殖民政策的灾难的渴望以及对和平、自由和独立的渴望，把所有这些国家团结在一起了。关于帝国主义万能的神话在殖民地国家中永远地消灭了。世界帝国主义首先是作为国际宪兵的美国，想要扼杀亚洲国家人民争取自己的自由和独立的奋不顾身的斗争的反动阴谋，正遭到一个又一个的失败。
    帝国主义阵营中的受狭隘的资产阶级世界观局限的思想家，企图把在世界舞台上发生的深刻变化说成是共产党人企图在各地夺取政权的“颠覆势力”所造成的，或者说是某种外来的干涉的结果。
    列宁说：“资本主义统治之所以被推翻并不是因为有谁想夺取政权。‘夺取’政权是一种荒谬的说法。如果资本主义国家的全部经济发展还没有到这种程度，要终止资本主义的统治是不可能的。……如果历史还没有冲毁和破坏资本主义，任何力量都不能摧毁资本主义……”
    但是正是由于历史已经冲毁了和破坏了资本主义，由于资本主义已经发展到了极限，因此，世界上没有任何一种力量能够遏止社会主义代替资本主义这一合乎规律的过程。列宁说过，这一过程是不可遏止的，因为，除社会主义外，再也找不到使人类免除战争和饥饿的办法，使千百万人免遭死亡的办法。
    由于这种合乎规律的社会发展过程的结果，现在在国际舞台上存在着两种世界性的社会体系：世界社会主义体系和世界资本主义体系。伟大的和平、民主和社会主义阵营团结了九亿人口，即全世界人口的三分之一以上。苏联、欧洲和亚洲的人民民主国家的经验明显不过地证明，在凡是人民管理国家的地方，凡是一切力量和财富都被用来为人民利益服务的地方，那里的无穷无尽的人的力量和创造就可获得解放，那里的大胆的理想和有胆略的计划就能实现，经济、文化和人民福利的不断增长就会成为那里的发展法则。
    外交政策方面的各种不同的方针是和各种不同的社会制度相适应的。
    苏联、中华人民共和国、所有人民民主国家在外交政策方面实现着伟大的列宁的原则：坚决和一贯地保卫着世界和平。列宁主义的出发点是，各种不同的社会经济制度的和平共处是可能的而且是必要的。某一国家建立某种社会和政治制度，这是这个国家人民的内部事务。苏联不干涉它国事务。它一贯地执行着自己的外交政策。实现建设共产主义社会的伟大计划要许多年，要几十年的时间，所以就要求巩固和持久的世界和平。为争取和平而斗争，这是社会主义国家国际政策基础的基础。苏联是和平的主要堡垒，是宣扬各国人民友谊、大国和小国人民自由和独立的代言人。
    伟大的列宁教导说，社会主义在经济竞赛中应当并且一定会显示出自己对资本主义的优越性。苏联人民确信：已经在实践中证实了自己对资本主义的决定优越性的社会主义在和平的经济竞赛过程中必将最后地战胜资本主义。苏维埃国家从自己建国最初的几天起就向资本主义旧世界提出了这种竞赛。苏联在这方面现在仍然是忠实于列宁的原则的。
    当然，经济竞赛决定了要在互利条件下普遍地展开贸易。贸易交换可以从文化联系中获得有成果的补充。这就是社会主义和资本主义和平共处的现实基础。一个统一的集体安全体系完全可以在这一基础上建立并成长起来，这个包括社会制度不同的一切国家的集体安全体系将能保障持久的巩固的和平。
    同苏联的和平外交政策方针相对立的是美国及其仆从国的侵略政策。从帝国主义者现行的整个政策中可以看出，他们是在把局势导向新的战争。所谓“实力地位”政策不是别的，就是公开地把赌注押在新的世界流血战争之上。“实力地位”政策不是什么新的东西，它完全是从希特勒分子那里抄袭来的。大家知道，正是希特勒和他的帮凶把下面的话当作国际关系方面的不变的信条：“我实行实力政策，不管什么虚伪的荣誉不荣誉。”“在外交政策上……发生作用的只有实力的逻辑。”“只有用恐怖的办法才能管理世界。”
    过去德国法西斯把赌注押在“实力政策”上，意味着他们决定发动第二次世界大战。现在美国某些反动人物把赌注押在“实力政策”上，意味着他们在公开准备第三次世界大战。
    美国反动人物建立的军事政治集团的体系是为侵略的战略服务的。北大西洋集团是这一体系的中心。现在十分明显，美国和西德之间的军事同盟在这一集团中起着主要杠杆的作用，这一同盟将要依靠“舒曼计划”的经济体系的军事工业的潜力，就是说依靠由于牺牲法国、比利时和意大利的资源而巩固和加强起来的鲁尔区。所谓巴黎协定的真正本质就在这里，因为巴黎协定不但要复活德国军国主义机器，而且还打算创造最有利的条件来实现德国军国主义的复仇计划。所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”的军事侵略集团和作为美英两国在阿拉伯东方实现帝国主义计划的工具的巴基斯坦—土耳其集团和土耳其—伊拉克集团是北大西洋集团的分支。美国建立了一个广泛的军事基地网，它配置这些基地的目的是企图威胁苏联、中华人民共和国和欧洲人民民主国家。“依仗实力”的侵略政策的内容是无止境地扩充军备、煽动战争歇斯底里和发动原子战争的恫吓性威胁，这一政策在毒害着国际的气氛以及导致和平的破坏。
    对于所有这种歇斯底里和准备新战争的狂妄计划、建立美国世界霸权的计划，可以说些什么呢？苏联不威胁任何人。它坚持不渝地实行着和平政策。苏联坚决主张：大力裁减各种军备、无条件禁止原子武器和在这方面建立有效的国际监督以及把原子能仅用于和平目的。用不朽的列宁的话来说，地球上绝大多数的居民都赞同我们的和平政策。
    我们相信自己的力量。苏联人民、民主阵营各国对和平敌人加紧阴谋活动的回答是：采取必要的措施以进一步加强自己的武装力量和保证自己的经济力量的不断增长。帝国主义者既吓不倒和平民主阵营的人民，也不能使他们措手不及。如果帝国主义阵营的发疯的统治者竟违背人民的意志，胆敢发动新的世界大战，那么苏联、它的忠实盟友、资本主义世界和殖民地各国热烈支持民主和和平思想的所有进步力量，必将给予他们以具有这样一种威力和这样一种规模的打击：把以疯狂地剥削劳动人民、以奴役亿万人民、以人民的苦难和流血为基础的、日益腐朽的帝国主义大厦化为灰烬。
    同志们！列宁在自己天才的著作之一“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”中写道，让资产阶级东奔西撞，凶狂暴戾，肆意横行，做出许多蠢事吧，被历史判处了死刑的一切阶级的所作所为总是这样的。将来的世界无论如何都是属于共产主义的。“共产主义真可说是从社会生活底一切方面‘生长起来’，它的幼芽真正是无处不有……这是生活的必然现象。”
    是的，这是生活的必然现象！尽管社会发展的各种趋势是多么复杂和充满矛盾，历史的大道已经确定了。这就是一条由马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林所宣告的道路，是通向共产主义的道路。
    同志们！我们无论在新生活的建设方面或是在国际舞台上所获得的一切胜利，都应当归功于伟大的共产党。我们的党是从工人阶级里面产生的。党缔造并锻炼了工农联盟——苏维埃社会制度的不可摧毁的力量。党之所以强大，是因为它是始终不渝地信任人民的。它永远无限地信任列宁的学说，它曾经并且正在坚决地引导着苏联人民沿着列宁的道路前进。
    列宁和党是共产主义伟大创造力的活的体现。我国人民对人类的天才、对他们亲爱的伊里奇的爱戴是无限的，是永恒的。我国人民对自己的英明的共产党的爱戴是无限的，是永恒的。
    党实现了列宁制定的建设社会主义社会的天才计划。忠于列宁学说的我们的党，在它的久经考验的中央委员会的领导下，现在正在胜利解决建设共产主义社会的宏伟任务。而党也一定能胜利地解决这一任务，因为被党提高到历史创造力的最高峰的人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因为列宁的战无不胜的思想的光芒照耀着通向这一目标的道路。
    我国伟大的人民——建设者万岁！
    我们光荣的共产党万岁！
    列宁主义万岁！
