    Nanchong Farmers Adopt Advanced Agricultural Techniques
    The broad masses of farmers in Nanchong County, Sichuan Province, are universally adopting advanced agricultural techniques in their spring plowing and sowing. Before the spring plowing, 3,300 farmers throughout the county attended short-term training courses organized by the county, where they learned advanced techniques for planting rice, cotton, corn, and sweet potatoes. After returning to their villages, they taught these techniques to more than 15,000 rural cadres and farmers in cooperatives and teams, and promoted them among the farmers through methods such as typical demonstrations and organized visits. This year, the rice planting has universally adopted advanced techniques such as "mud-water seed selection" and "flat new-style seedling fields." In Village One of Nanju Township, there are a total of 148 burdens of seedling fields. Last year, only 63 burdens of fields adopted "flat new-style seedling fields," and most of them were merely formalities due to incorrect methods and other reasons. This year, the farmers understood its benefits, truly learned the techniques, mutually adjusted the seedling fields and improved seeds. Except for two burdens of seedling fields, the entire village adopted "flat new-style seedling fields." The village stored more than 2,300 catties of improved seeds such as "Zhongnong No. 4" and "Victory Xian," and also set up five "mud-water seed selection" stations to help farmers select seeds.

    南充农民采用先进农业技术
    四川南充县广大农民春耕播种中普遍采用了先进的农业技术。春耕以前，全县有三千三百名农民在县上举办的短期训练班分别学会了种植水稻、棉花、玉米和红苕等先进技术。他们回到乡里后，又向一万五千多乡村干部、社、组的农民传授了技术，并采取典型示范、组织参观等办法在农民中推广。今年种植的水稻，普遍采用了“泥水选种”、“平新式秧田”等先进技术。南居乡一村共有一百四十八挑秧田，去年采用“平新式秧田”的只有六十三挑田，因为做法不对等原因，大半流于形式。今年农民们懂得了它的好处，真正学会了技术，互相调剂了秧田和优良种籽，全村除两挑秧田外，都采用了“平新式秧田”。村上储藏了两千三百多斤“中农四号”、“胜利籼”等优良种籽，还设立五个“泥水选种”站，帮助农民选种。  （本报驻重庆记者）
