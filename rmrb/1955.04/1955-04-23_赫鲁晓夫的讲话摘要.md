Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 21st - TASS reported from Warsaw on April 21st: The head of the Soviet government delegation, N.S. Khrushchev, spoke on April 20th at the celebration in Warsaw marking the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-Polish Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Post-War Cooperation.

    Khrushchev first conveyed congratulations to the Polish people from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    Khrushchev mentioned that these days, all progressive humanity is solemnly commemorating the 85th anniversary of the birth of Lenin, the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world. Leninism illuminates the path of the victorious struggle of the working people for their own liberation. Once Leninism takes hold of the masses, it turns into a great force for transforming society on a socialist basis. Just as Lenin foresaw, the imperialist world suffered new and extremely severe losses in the Second World War. The people of many countries in Asia and Europe overthrew and defeated capitalism in their countries, and firmly embarked on the path of socialist development.

    Khrushchev then said: The Soviet-Polish treaty eternally fixes the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Polish peoples, which has deep historical roots. Khrushchev said that the past ten years have fully confirmed the words of J.V. Stalin: The Soviet-Polish treaty marks a fundamental change in the relations between our two countries; it is a guarantee of the independence of the new democratic Poland, and a guarantee of its strength and prosperity. The Soviet people, together with you, rejoice in your achievements, and are prepared to give the Polish people comprehensive support and assistance at any time, supporting and assisting their constructive labor.

    Khrushchev pointed out that the reactionary forces of imperialism are pursuing an aggressive policy, expanding armaments and piecing together various blocs against peace-loving countries. They are reviving West German militarism. Khrushchev said that the eight European countries participating in the Moscow conference, taking into account the threat of the Paris Agreements, decided to take measures to ensure their own security, and are preparing to sign a treaty of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance, as well as to establish a joint military command. When German militarism rears its head again, the governments of democratic countries cannot but take such measures. We are unwilling to be caught off guard, so we must constantly strengthen the strength and power of our peace camp.

    Khrushchev said: The Soviet government is pursuing a peaceful foreign policy, which is based on Lenin's principle that the socialist system and the capitalist system can coexist peacefully. In international policy, there are now two paths and two policies: on the one hand, the policy adhered to by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, which is the policy of peaceful resolution of outstanding issues; on the other hand, the policy of the imperialists, which is the policy of arms race and preparing for war. All those who cherish the cause of peace advocate the peaceful coexistence of the two systems.

    We do not close our eyes to the contradictions that exist between capitalist and socialist countries. But, despite this, we believe that as long as we adhere to the principle of coexistence, we can guarantee peaceful relations between countries and between peoples. It is no secret that capitalists are enemies of communism, because they are capitalists. Needless to say, communists and the broad masses of working people who sympathize with communists are enemies of capitalism, because capitalism is a system of exploitation of man by man, it generates destructive crises and devastating wars, and it brings pain and disaster to the vast majority of people.

    No matter how much the capitalists and their governments want to eliminate the socialist camp, it does not depend on them. The socialist camp is constantly growing and consolidating, developing and growing like all young, healthy and progressive forces.

    At the same time, it should be pointed out that the ideologues of imperialism spread a ghost story, insisting that socialist countries forcibly impose their own social system on other countries, but few people believe this ghost story now. Revolution does not come from the outside. Revolution occurs because of the contradictions between the working people and the exploiters within a country.

    If we take a calm look at reality and the balance of power, we can draw the conclusion that peaceful coexistence is the only correct and wise path of development.

    Khrushchev then said: In international relations, the Soviet Union believes that its main tasks are: to ease international tensions, to consolidate and develop trade ties and cooperation with all countries, and to ensure a consolidated and lasting peace.

    The recent talks in Moscow between the Soviet Union and Austria on the Austrian peace treaty are one of the obvious manifestations of the Soviet Union's commitment to resolving outstanding issues peacefully. This meeting is of great significance to the cause of easing international tensions, and it also proves that international issues can and should be resolved peacefully as long as both sides have the desire and sincerity.

    Khrushchev said: The people of Asia and Africa are making a major contribution to ensuring world peace. They are taking the decision-making power on the most important issues of their country's foreign policy into their own hands, and are increasingly resolutely opposing colonial oppression, opposing the imperialist policy of preparing for war and the policy of using the people as tools of colonial countries. The Asian-African Conference being held these days in Bandung is playing a huge role in this regard.

    Khrushchev also said: The imperialists are inciting hostility between the peoples of all countries, especially trying to incite hostility towards the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and other democratic countries among the people of capitalist countries.

    Many prominent figures in capitalist countries, especially the United States, openly and shamelessly boast about their plans to eliminate entire countries, destroy cities, and annihilate millions of people. Can all this prove that the ruling groups of imperialist countries are committed to peace? Many newspapers and magazines in the United States unscrupulously clamor for preparing for war. At the same time, the U.S. government is setting up an agency on disarmament issues. Wouldn't it be better to ban war propaganda instead of establishing such an agency, as the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have done? Wouldn't it be better to adopt the Soviet Union's proposal to ban the use and production of atomic and hydrogen weapons? Wouldn't it be better to compete in the peaceful use of atomic energy instead of competing in the production of weapons of mass destruction of mankind?

    The Soviet government has made clear statements on the issue of stopping the arms race, and the entire progressive humanity supports us in this regard.

    The imperialists are fabricating a so-called "iron curtain" fallacy, insisting that the Soviet Union uses this "iron curtain" to isolate it from the capitalist world. Let us see who is really building this iron curtain. In recent years, many people from the United States, Britain, and other capitalist countries have visited the Soviet Union. Many of them are representatives of the bourgeoisie, and there are also quite a few reactionary figures who advocate far from progressive views. However, they were granted permission to visit the Soviet Union, and they did not encounter as many obstacles from the "iron curtain" as the bourgeois newspapers advertised everywhere they went.

    What is the behavior of the U.S. ruling group? They do not allow peace-loving people to enter the United States, and they impose some degrading conditions on Soviet citizens who are invited to visit the United States. From this, it can be seen that the "iron curtain" is not in the Soviet Union, but in the United States.

    Or look at the development of trade relations. The United States prohibits countries dependent on it from engaging in free international trade, especially prohibiting them from engaging in free trade with countries in the democratic camp. The United States intends to sell us goods that it cannot sell, while at the same time saying that they want to exchange strategic raw materials. Naturally, every country with self-respect will not accept such harsh conditions. We have always said in the past and now: Let's conduct equal trade! This trade will promote the rapprochement of the people of all countries and enable them to achieve better mutual understanding. The reactionary groups in the United States use newspapers, radio stations and all propaganda tools to incite war hysteria, while at the same time, they describe the policies of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and the people's democratic countries as aggressive policies.

    Who does not understand that the U.S. imperialists and their hired lackeys are clamoring about the so-called aggression and stubbornness of the Soviet Union and other democratic countries in order to justify the imperialists' actions in preparing for a new war in front of the public opinion in their own countries. This propaganda is mainly to find an excuse for increasing the taxes of the working people, which are used to expand armaments in order to ensure that monopoly capital obtains huge profits.

    Many political leaders in the United States and other countries are trying to convince the people of their own countries that it is impossible to reach an agreement with the countries of the socialist camp, and that they can only negotiate with them from a "position of strength". They think that they can achieve their goals by means of threats and intimidation. However, this method can only work on some neurotic people in Western countries, and it will not work when dealing with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and other people's democratic countries.

    The whole world knows that the Soviet Union has never been afraid of threats, and it is still the same now. Everyone knows how many short-sighted people in Western Europe and the United States viewed our peace-loving policy as a result of weakness in the period before the Second World War. During the years of the Second World War, the whole world believed in the strength and power of the socialist countries. Now, when the strength of the Soviet Union has grown immeasurably, the people of our country are becoming more and more convinced of their own strength. It should also be noted that the balance of power in the world has undergone fundamental changes in the post-war period. The great People's Republic of China has become a powerful country. The Polish People's Republic and other people's democratic countries are becoming increasingly consolidated. The forces of socialism and democracy are stronger than the forces of imperialist aggressors. Only adventurers can fail to take this into account. There is no doubt that if the imperialists dare to launch a new world war, then the result will inevitably be the collapse of the entire world capitalist system.

    Khrushchev said: The people of the socialist camp are vigilantly watching the conspiracies of the imperialist aggressors, and are more closely uniting their ranks and strengthening their unity in the struggle for peace and the construction of socialism. They are unswervingly developing their national economy, and pay special attention to the development of heavy industry. This is a reliable guarantee of our country's freedom and independence.

    Khrushchev said: Dear comrades and friends! In the past, the people of our two countries waged a common struggle together, against the common enemies - the Tsar's autocracy, and against the Russian and Polish landlords and capitalists, and fought for social liberation. We once fought together against German fascism. In the post-war period, we have been unswervingly marching side by side along the road of building a new socialist life for ten years.

    The great son of the Polish people, a student and comrade-in-arms of Lenin, and a fearless revolutionary fighter, Felix Dzerzhinsky, spoke about the fate of Poland in a letter to the Dovbysh workers about thirty years ago, and dreamed of seeing a "socialist Poland - free and independent from capitalist countries, a Poland that is powerful because of its alliance with the Soviet Republic". This dream has now come true.

    Khrushchev concluded by saying: Today, as we commemorate the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-Polish treaty, we firmly believe that for the happiness of the people of our two countries, the friendship, mutual assistance and fraternal cooperation between the Polish People's Republic and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics will continue to grow and strengthen.

### 赫鲁晓夫的讲话摘要

    赫鲁晓夫的讲话摘要
    新华社二十二日讯　据塔斯社华沙二十一日讯：苏联政府代表团团长尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫四月二十日在华沙举行的波苏友好、互助与战后合作条约签订十周年庆祝大会上讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫首先代表苏联最高苏维埃主席团、苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会，向波兰人民致祝贺。
    赫鲁晓夫谈到，这些天，所有进步人类都在隆重地纪念全世界劳动人民伟大的领袖和导师列宁诞辰八十五周年。列宁主义照耀着劳动人民争取自身解放的胜利斗争的道路。列宁主义思想一掌握群众，就变成在社会主义基础上改造社会的伟大力量。就像列宁所预见的，帝国主义世界在第二次世界大战中遭受了新的极其严重的损失。欧亚两洲的许多国家的人民在他们的国家推翻了打垮了资本主义，坚定地走上了社会主义发展的道路。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说：波苏条约把具有深远的历史根源的苏波两国人民的牢不可破的友谊永恒地固定下来了。赫鲁晓夫说，过去的十年完全证实了约·维·斯大林的话：苏波条约标志着我们两国关系的根本转变，它是新的民主波兰的独立的保证，是它的强盛、它的繁荣的保证。苏联人民同你们一起，为你们的成就而欢欣，并且准备随时给波兰人民以全面的支持和帮助，支持和帮助他们的建设性劳动。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，帝国主义反动势力执行着侵略政策，在扩充军备和拼凑反对爱好和平的国家的各种集团。它们在复活西德军国主义。赫鲁晓夫说，参加莫斯科会议的欧洲八个国家考虑到巴黎协定的威胁，决定采取保证自己安全的措施，准备签订友好合作互助条约，以及成立联合军事司令部。当德国军国主义重新抬头的时候，民主国家的政府不能不采取这样的措施。我们是不愿意措手不及的，所以要不断加强我们和平阵营的力量和威力。
    赫鲁晓夫说：苏联政府实行和平外交政策，这一政策是根据列宁关于社会主义制度和资本主义制度可以和平共处的原则制定的。在国际政策中现在有两条道路和两种方针：一方面是苏联和人民民主国家坚持的方针，就是和平解决悬而未决的问题的方针；另一方面是帝国主义者的方针，就是军备竞赛和准备战争的方针。所有珍视和平事业的人都主张两个制度的和平共处。
    我们并没有闭眼不看资本主义国家和社会主义国家之间存在着矛盾。但是，尽管如此，我们相信，只要坚持共处的原则，就能保障国家之间和人民之间的和平关系。资本家是共产主义的敌人，这并不是什么秘密，因为他们是资本家。不用说，共产党人和同情共产党人的广大劳动人民群众是资本主义的敌人，因为资本主义是一种人剥削人的制度，它产生破坏性的危机和毁灭性的战争，它给绝大多数的人们带来痛苦和灾难。
    不管资本家和他们的政府如何想消灭社会主义阵营，但是这是不决定于他们的。社会主义阵营不断地成长和巩固，像一切年青、健康和进步的力量发展和成长一样。
    同时，应当指出，帝国主义的思想家散布一种鬼话，硬说社会主义国家用强力把自己的社会制度强加于其他国家，现在相信这种鬼话的人是很少了。革命不是从外面来的。革命是由于一个国家内部的劳动人民和剥削者之间的矛盾而发生的。
    如果冷静地看一下现实和力量对比，就可以得出这样的结论：和平共处是唯一正确的和明智的发展道路。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说：在国际关系方面，苏联认为自己的主要任务是：缓和国际紧张局势，巩固和发展同所有国家的贸易联系和合作，保障巩固的和持久的和平。
    最近在莫斯科结束的苏奥关于对奥和约的会谈是苏联致力以和平方式解决悬而未决的问题的明显的表现之一。这次会谈对缓和国际紧张局势的事业有着重大的意义，它还证明了：只要双方都有愿望和诚意，国际问题是可以而且应当以和平方式解决的。
    赫鲁晓夫说：亚非两洲人民正在对保证世界和平做出重大的贡献。他们把自己国家外交政策最重要的问题的决定权掌握在自己手中，并且日益坚决地反对殖民压迫，反对帝国主义准备战争的政策和把人民作为殖民国家工具的政策。这几天在万隆举行的亚非会议在这方面起着巨大的作用。
    赫鲁晓夫又说：帝国主义者正在各国人民之间煽动敌视，特别是尽力在资本主义各国人民间煽动对苏联、中华人民共和国和其他民主国家的仇视情绪。
    资本主义国家，特别是美国的许多显要人物公开无耻地夸耀他们的要消灭整批国家、毁灭城市、歼灭数以百万计的人们的计划。难道这一切能证明帝国主义国家统治集团是致力于和平的吗？美国许多报纸和杂志肆无忌惮地叫嚣准备战争。而同时美国政府却在设立裁军问题机构。如果代替建立这种机构的是禁止战争宣传，就像苏联和各人民民主国家所做的那样，那岂不更好吗？如果采纳苏联关于禁止使用和生产原子武器和氢武器的建议难道不更好吗？如果不去在生产大规模歼灭人类的武器方面竞赛，而是在和平使用原子能方面竞赛，难道不更好吗？
    苏联政府就停止扩充军备的问题已提出过明确的声明，在这方面整个进步人类都是支持我们的。
    帝国主义者在编造一种所谓“铁幕”的谬论，硬说苏联用这种“铁幕”使它和资本主义世界隔离。让我们看一下，是谁真正在建立这种铁幕。最近几年来，美国、英国和其他资本主义国家的许多人访问了苏联。他们之中有许多是资产阶级的代表，也有相当多的鼓吹远不是进步观点的反动人物。然而，他们得到了访问苏联的许可，他们到处访问也没有遇到资产阶级报纸宣传得那么多的“铁幕”的阻碍。
    美国统治集团的行径是怎样的呢？他们不让爱好和平的人进入美国，对应邀访问美国的苏联公民提出一些降低人格的条件。由此可见，“铁幕”不在苏联，而在美国。
    或者就贸易关系的发展来看。美国禁止依赖它的国家进行自由国际贸易，特别是禁止它们同民主阵营的国家进行自由贸易。美国打算把没有销路的存货卖给我们，而同时还说，他们希望换取战略原料。自然，每一个自尊的国家都不会接受这种苛刻的条件。我们过去和现在都一直讲：进行平等的贸易吧！这种贸易将促进各国人民的接近，使他们之间获得更好的相互谅解。美国的反动集团利用报刊、电台和所有宣传工具来煽动战争歇斯底里，同时，他们却把苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家的政策说成是侵略政策。
    谁不明白，美国帝国主义者和他们的雇佣奴仆在叫嚷所谓苏联和其他民主国家的侵略和顽固，以便在自己国家的舆论面前为帝国主义者准备新战争的行动作辩护。这种宣传主要是为了替增加劳动人民的税收寻找借口，而这种税收却是用于扩充军备，以保证垄断资本获得巨额利润的。
    美国和其他国家的许多政治首脑力图使他们本国的人民相信，要同社会主义阵营的国家取得协议是不可能的，只有靠“实力地位”才能同它们进行谈判。他们自以为，用威胁和恫吓的手段就能达到目的。但是，这种方法只对西方国家的某些神经衰弱的人士还能起作用，在同苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家打交道时这种方法是行不通的。
    全世界都知道，苏联是从来不怕威胁的，现在也还是一样。大家都知道，在第二次世界大战之前的时期中，西欧和美国的许多没有远见的人士如何把我们的爱好和平的政策看成是软弱的结果。在第二次世界大战的年代中，全世界都相信了社会主义国家的实力和强大。现在，当苏联的实力无比地增长了的时候，我国人民是愈来愈深信自己的力量。还应当注意到，世界的力量对比在战后时期中起了根本的变化。伟大的中华人民共和国变成了强国。波兰人民共和国和其他人民民主国家日益巩固。社会主义和民主的力量比帝国主义侵略者的力量强大。只有冒险分子才能不考虑到这一点。毫无疑问，如果帝国主义者胆敢发动新的世界大战，那么，结果必然是整个世界资本主义体系的崩溃。
    赫鲁晓夫说：社会主义阵营各国人民警惕地注视着帝国主义侵略者的阴谋诡计，在争取和平和建设社会主义的斗争中，更加紧密地团结自己的队伍和加强团结。他们在坚持不渝地发展国民经济，特别重视重工业的发展。这是我们国家自由和独立的可靠的保障。
    赫鲁晓夫说：亲爱的同志和朋友们！过去我们两国人民曾进行了共同的斗争，一起反对过共同的敌人——沙皇的专制、反对过俄国和波兰的地主和资本家，争取过社会的解放。我们曾经为反对德国法西斯主义而共同斗争。在战后，我们确信不移地并肩沿着建设新的社会主义生活的道路前进已经十年了。
    波兰人民的伟大儿子、列宁的学生和战友、无畏的革命勇士菲利克斯·捷尔任斯基大约三十年以前在给多夫比希工人们的信中谈到波兰的命运时，曾经梦想看见一个“社会主义的波兰——自由的和摆脱资本主义国家而独立的、因和苏维埃共和国联盟结成同盟而强有力的波兰”。这个梦想现在已经实现了。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说：今天在纪念波苏条约签订十周年的时候，我们坚信，为了我们两国人民的幸福，波兰人民共和国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟之间的友谊、互助和兄弟合作将不断地成长和加强。
