Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 2nd: According to TASS, the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) conference concluded its discussion on the economic situation in Asia and the Far East on March 31st.

    The Philippine representative attacked the memorandum submitted to the conference by the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) delegation, claiming that the memorandum distorted the economic development of countries in the ECAFE region. Representatives of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee supported his opinion. They attempted to deny the harmful effects of American policies on the countries in this region and accused the Secretariat of improperly publishing the memorandum of the WFTU delegation. The U.S. representative tried to cast doubt on the representativeness of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

    Soviet representative Menshikov condemned this attitude, which hinders a free exchange of views on the economic situation in Asia.

    ECAFE Secretary-General Lokanathan then also refuted the accusations made by the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee against the Secretariat.

    During the discussion of the report of the Committee on Industry and Trade, Soviet representative Menshikov emphasized the part of the report which pointed out that the U.S. dumping of surplus agricultural products seriously damaged the economies of several countries in the region. He said, "We advocate trade that will enable countries in the ECAFE region to purchase the goods they need, and that the import of these goods will not harm the production of these countries." He said that the Soviet delegation did not object to the adoption of the report, but he pointed out that the report failed to mention the obstacles created by the United States to trade with the People's Republic of China, nor did it mention the piratical attacks by Chiang Kai-shek, who is protected by the United States, which is a shortcoming.

    联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会结束了经济情况的讨论
    苏联代表指责美国在亚洲制造贸易的障碍
    新华社二日讯　据塔斯社东京讯：联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会会议三月三十一日结束了关于亚洲和远东的经济状况的讨论。
    菲律宾代表对世界工会联合会代表团提交会议的备忘录进行攻击，他硬说这份备忘录歪曲了亚洲及远东经济委员会地区国家的经济发展情况。蒋介石和李承晚的代表支持他的意见。他们企图否认美国的政策给这一地区国家所带来的有害影响，并且指责秘书处公布世界工会联合会代表团的备忘录是不正当的。美国代表则试图对世界工会联合会的代表性表示怀疑。
    苏联代表曼希科夫谴责这种妨碍就亚洲的经济状况自由地交换意见的态度。
    亚洲及远东经济委员会秘书长洛卡纳坦接着也驳斥了蒋介石和李承晚的代表对秘书处的指责。
    在讨论工业及贸易委员会的报告时，苏联代表曼希科夫发言强调了这个报告中指出美国倾销剩余农产品的做法严重地损害了这个地区若干国家的经济的部分。他说，我们主张进行这样的贸易，这种贸易将使亚洲及远东经济委员会地区国家能够购买他们所需要的货物，而这些货物的进口将不损害这些国家的生产。他说，苏联代表团并不反对通过这个报告，但是他指出，报告没有提到美国所制造的阻碍同中华人民共和国进行贸易的障碍，也没有提到受美国庇护的蒋介石的海盗袭击，这是一个缺点。
