Comrades, on this national holiday—the tenth anniversary of Hungary's liberation from Hitler's occupation and the establishment of a people's regime in this country—I extend, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Government, and on behalf of all the people of the Soviet Union, my heartfelt greetings to you, and through you to all the Hungarian people.

Ten years ago, the heroic Soviet army closely pursued the fascist troops, entered the Nazi-occupied territory of Hungary, and by April 4, 1945, had completely defeated the fascist Hitlerite army, liberating Hungary from the hands of the imperialist aggressors. This event proved to be a turning point in the life of the Hungarian people.

For centuries, the freedom-loving Hungarian people fought with extraordinary heroism and courage against Turkish, German-Austrian, and other foreign invaders, striving for their national independence and freedom, but due to the criminal policies of the Hungarian landlords and capitalists, who betrayed national interests more than once, the people's hopes could not be realized. Even after the First World War, when Hungary formally became an independent state, it remained heavily dependent on the major imperialist countries. Only when the Soviet army drove the fascist occupiers out of Hungary did the Hungarian people, for the first time in their history, have a real opportunity to establish a truly independent and sovereign state.

After entering Hungarian territory as a liberating army, the Soviet army gave the Hungarian people full freedom to resolve their own affairs in the way they wished and to establish the socio-political system they considered most suitable for themselves.

The Hungarian people put an end forever to the political and economic domination of the landlords and capitalists, took power into their own hands, and established a people's democratic regime.

Therefore, the establishment of the people's democratic state of Hungary is not only the victorious end of the Hungarian people's years of struggle for national independence but also the beginning of a new era in Hungarian history—an era of people's democracy and the laying of socialist foundations.

The Soviet people, like all freedom-loving people around the world, applauded this historically significant victory of the glorious Hungarian people with sincere joy and great satisfaction.

Comrades, more than ten years ago, on December 21, 1944, the "Address to the Hungarian People" adopted at the first meeting of the Hungarian Provisional National Assembly in Debrecen (a city liberated not long before that day) declared: "We firmly believe that Hungary will begin to prosper increasingly. We want to lay the foundation that will make Hungary strong and happy, and we want to see Hungary become an independent state."

The wishes expressed by the Hungarian people in this Address to the Hungarian People have been realized.

The ten years since then have been a time of genuine prosperity and rebirth for the nation, a time of profound reforms in the economic, political, and cultural spheres, and a time of genuine prosperity for Hungary.

During this historically significant decade in Hungarian history, the most important results have been the people's acquisition of power under the leadership of the working class, the strengthening of the country's true independence and sovereignty, the consolidation of the people's democratic regime, and the great achievements made in laying the foundations for socialism.

Since the day the Hungarian people were liberated, they have begun to work hard under the leadership of the working class, primarily its party, to restore the national economy and democratize the country.

A very important action taken by the new people's regime was land reform, which fulfilled the centuries-long dream of millions of hired laborers, landless, and land-poor peasants for land. The completion of the land reform was a development of enormous historical significance, eradicating the remnants of feudalism and the landlord system. The fighting alliance of the working class and the working peasants, which makes the people's democratic regime strong and unshakable, was strengthened in the implementation of this reform.

The heroic efforts of the Hungarian working people in restoring the national economy cannot be overestimated.

The Nazi demons plundered the country, leaving many of its cities and villages in ruins. Only the irresistible offensive of the Soviet army prevented the Nazis from turning Hungary into a desert, from depriving the Hungarian people of their homes and bread, and from completely destroying your beautiful capital, Budapest.

The Hungarian economy was restored and developed precisely in the face of fierce resistance from anti-people forces. The enemies predicted that the recovery of Hungary's national economy would take decades, and that this recovery would be impossible unless Hungary received aid from American millionaires. But these predictions did not come true. The Hungarian working people have overcome all difficulties; they have not only restored the national economy but also rebuilt industry and transportation along the socialist road.

As everyone knows, old Hungary was a backward agricultural country with a backward industry, most of which was controlled by foreign capital. In a short period, the Hungarian people overcame the backwardness of the country's industry. It is enough to recall that during the twenty years before the Second World War, the total output of all factories and manufacturing plants in old Hungary increased by only twenty percent, while in the first ten years under the People's Democratic government, the total output increased to three times the pre-war level, i.e., an average annual increase of as high as thirty percent, rather than the one percent of old Hungary. Agricultural, industrially backward Hungary has grown into a country with advanced socialist industry.

Heavy industry, the foundation of the socialist economy, and its core—the machine-building industry—have been making constant progress. Coal and oil production, as well as electricity generation, have doubled in five years; the production of machinery, steel, steel products, aluminum, and other important products has more than doubled.

Several new industries that did not exist before the war have been established. New machines and complex machine tools, which are extremely important for the national economy, have begun to be manufactured. The Hungarian people have established new industrial centers and many industrial enterprises with heroic efforts.

Due to the victorious development of industry, the country has created all the conditions for the rapid development of agriculture on a new, advanced social basis.

In agriculture, the Hungarian Republic has also definitely made remarkable progress in the years since the establishment of the People's Government. However, the Third Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party correctly emphasized that agriculture must be further developed and that the production of grain, meat, oil, and other agricultural products necessary to fully meet the country's growing needs must be greatly expanded in the years to come. The victorious resolution of this most important issue of the national economy is of vital concern to all the Hungarian people.

Everyone knows that the potential of individual agriculture to increase agricultural production is very limited. Large-scale socialist agricultural production, which enables modern machinery and the latest achievements of scientific farming to play the highest efficiency, is undoubtedly superior to individual agriculture. This has been proven not only by the historical experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union but also by the experience of Hungary's own advanced agricultural production cooperatives.

The Hungarian Working People's Party and the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic correctly believe that agricultural production can only truly advance and develop through the socialist transformation of agriculture.

Forward-looking Hungarian farmers immediately established the first agricultural production cooperatives after the completion of land reform. They believe that collective agricultural management is not only the only way to build a prosperous life but also to meet their growing cultural needs. Since then, the idea of collective agricultural management has taken root in the Hungarian countryside. Since then, thousands of Hungarian farmers have recognized the benefits of collective agricultural management and have formed production cooperatives one after another. Now, production cooperatives, together with state-owned farms, own one-third of the country's arable land. They know from their own experience that collective agricultural management guarantees much greater yields, higher livestock productivity, and constantly increasing cash and in-kind income than individual farmers.

The Hungarian Working People's Party and the People's Government pay great attention to the development and strengthening of production cooperatives, taking all necessary measures to help them expand and develop, and are assisting individual farmers, who for various reasons have not joined cooperatives, to improve their agricultural production for the benefit of all the people.

Year after year, the constantly increasing number of machine tractor stations are beginning to play an increasingly important role in solving the problem of improving agriculture and transforming agriculture along socialist lines. The national agriculture owns thousands of tractors, harvesting combines, and other modern agricultural machines.

The Soviet people sincerely congratulate the Hungarian working people on their great achievements in completing the difficult and exciting task of fully and rapidly developing agriculture.

Comrades, in the past ten years, the material and cultural living standards of the Hungarian working people have greatly improved. Thanks to the constant concern of the Hungarian Working People's Party and the Hungarian government for improving the welfare of the people, unemployment, which has always been a real disaster in old Hungary, has been eliminated; rationing, a legacy of the war years, has been abolished; the prices of food and daily necessities have been gradually reduced, while the real wages of workers and staff, as well as the income of working peasants, are constantly increasing. The scale of housing construction is expanding day by day.

The People's Government is most concerned with improving the living standards of working people in urban and rural areas and satisfying their growing material and cultural needs. However, it must be particularly emphasized that this task can only be successfully completed by expanding socialist reproduction and maximizing productivity through further socialist industrialization.

Without the continuous development of heavy industry, it is impossible to improve the living standards of the working people, to develop agriculture, and to develop the industry of daily necessities. The great Lenin taught that "the only material foundation of socialism is large-scale machine industry, which can also transform agriculture." Any violation of the Leninist-Stalinist principle of giving priority to the development of heavy industry will inevitably undermine the entire national economy and weaken the country's economic strength and national defense.

The Hungarian working class believes that their main task is to strive to increase labor productivity. Our great teacher Lenin said, "Labor productivity is, in the final analysis, the most important and the main condition for ensuring the victory of the new social system." Without the gradual increase in productivity, the final victory of socialism is unimaginable.

The Hungarian People's Republic has made great progress in developing a new culture—a new culture with socialist content and national form. For the first time in Hungarian history, culture and art have become the property of the broad masses of the people. Under the Horthy regime and the monarchist rule, the gates of higher education were virtually closed to the working people. Today, the children of workers, peasants, and working intellectuals are studying in domestic universities and other institutions of higher education. New intellectuals have grown up from among the people with whom they are inseparably linked. Representatives of the old intellectuals have also begun to play an appropriate role in the common effort to build socialism and contribute all their strength to serve the people.

Hungarian scientists, writers, artists, painters, sculptors, and composers have achieved great success. The works of outstanding figures in Hungarian culture are well known in our country and have received due respect and love from the Soviet people.

Comrades, in retrospect of the glorious decade under the People's Government, one cannot but note with satisfaction that the unity of the Party and the people is increasingly strengthened in their struggle for the victory of socialism. The Hungarian Working People's Party is the Hungarian people's long-tested and battle-hardened leader, and it has their unlimited trust and ardent love. The consolidation of the spiritual and political unity of the Hungarian people, and their close unity around the working-class party, is the invincible force of the people's democratic regime and the guarantee of continuous progress towards socialism.

As everyone knows, there have been and still are many difficulties and obstacles on the road to socialism.

The Hungarian Working People's Party is overcoming these difficulties, resolutely exposing errors and shortcomings, and unhesitatingly eliminating all kinds of deviations from Marxism-Leninism, thereby confidently leading the country to new victories.

The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, held not long ago, considered the political situation and the tasks of the Party. The resolutions of the plenary session made a detailed analysis of the national economic situation, pointing out not only the progress that has been made but also the errors and shortcomings that have been manifested in the process of socialist construction, and correctly stipulated the measures to overcome these shortcomings and the tasks of consolidating and developing the people's democratic system. The resolutions of the plenary session, which have been supported unanimously not only by the Party but also by the entire people, prove that these resolutions are in line with the vital interests of the country.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes that the resolutions of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party are the fraternal Party's combat program at this time.

There is no doubt that the Hungarian people, under the leadership of the Working People's Party and its Central Committee, will achieve greater success in developing the country's economy, improving the living standards of the working people, and building socialism in Hungary.

Dear Comrades, the decade since the liberation of Hungary has been a period of strengthening and developing the friendship between the Hungarian and Soviet peoples.

The Soviet-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance, signed on February 18, 1948, as well as other treaties signed by the Soviet Union and other fraternal people's democratic countries, helps to promote the close cooperation of all nations based on mutual respect for independence and sovereignty. The close cooperation between the countries of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp is an important factor in strengthening security and an important contribution to the common struggle of ordinary people all over the world against launching another war.

The friendly relations between our countries are built on the basis of the deep-rooted common interests and international solidarity of the people themselves. The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the various People's Democratic countries have been, are, and will continue to pursue a consistent policy of peace and establish their relations with all countries, regardless of size, on the principles of respecting the sovereignty and genuine national independence of all nations, as well as equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in internal affairs.

All these ensure the possibility of peaceful coexistence between countries—regardless of social and political systems.

The ruling groups of the imperialist countries, headed by the United States of America, are pursuing a completely opposite policy in international relations. They are doing everything possible to obstruct the easing of international tensions and are openly preparing for a new war. They are stepping up the arms race and the production of atomic weapons, inflating war budgets to unprecedented levels, building more and more military bases in order to attack the Soviet Union, China, and other countries in the peace and socialism camp, and piecing together aggressive blocs.

In Europe, they are striving to revive German militarism, determined to make it the strike force of the aggression they are plotting. In Asia, they are establishing military alliances and blocs aimed at the great Chinese people and other nations that have embarked on the road of democratic development, supporting the Chiang Kai-shek clique, provoking the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan region they illegally occupy, and interfering in China's internal affairs.

The People's Democratic systems established in several countries in Europe and Asia are disliked by the imperialist reactionaries. They dream of replacing the People's Democratic systems in those countries with capitalist order, and dream of imposing the shackles of oppression and exploitation on the working people. However, the people of all countries do not want to return to the evil capitalist era of the past, and they will certainly be able to defend themselves and the People's Democratic systems they have established against these shameless attacks, if necessary.

The people of the countries in the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism recognize that the persistent attempts by imperialist elements in some countries to revive German militarism pose an ever-increasing danger to their security, and therefore have to take the necessary steps to strengthen their defense in order to counter the forces of aggression with their united strength. Representatives of eight European countries agreed at their meeting in Moscow last December to take the necessary steps to organize their armed forces and establish a joint command for this purpose.

The ratification of the Paris Agreements has fundamentally changed the international situation.

Indeed, only a few members of the British House of Commons and the French National Assembly voted in favor of ratifying the Paris Agreements, which endanger the cause of peace. As everyone knows, the people of these and other countries are conducting just and active resistance to the policy of reviving the aggressive and revanchist German Wehrmacht. Only under the pressure of the US aggressor group and their accomplices did the parliaments of various countries ratify the Paris Agreements against the will of the people.

Due to the ratification of the Paris Agreements, the tense situation in world relations has certainly intensified, and the danger of a new war has increased. The people of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries will draw all necessary conclusions from this fact and will mobilize their strength to strengthen the economic strength and defense capabilities of their countries.

The people of the socialist camp firmly believe in their strength and their inexhaustible resources. The camp of peace and socialism has never been as strong and as rock-solid as it is today. Our people are doing, and will continue to do, everything necessary to prevent a new war. But let the warmongers know that if they impose another war on mankind, then woe betide them. The people of democratic countries have repeatedly stated that they do not want a war that will bring immeasurable suffering and disaster to millions of human beings. Their goal is to defend peace, and to make it possible for all peoples to enjoy the great happiness of a peaceful and tranquil human life.

The Paris Agreements have been ratified, but it is not too late to prevent their implementation and to prevent the revival of German militarism, the most dangerous factor in launching a new war.

This is required by the interests of all the peoples, including the German people. The German people need peace, they need a reunited, peaceful Germany, not a Wehrmacht led by Hitler's bandit generals.

The Soviet government has stated more than once that its purpose is to ease international tensions and to take the initiative in resolving disputes peacefully. This peaceful initiative of the Soviet government has been warmly welcomed and approved by the progressive masses around the world, and the sympathy of the broad masses of people in all countries is on our side. The forces of peace are growing every day, and they are already much stronger today than the forces of war and aggression.

Dear Comrades, let me express to you my firm confidence that the heroic Hungarian people, who are celebrating the tenth anniversary of their liberation today, will make a valuable contribution to the common cause of further strengthening the forces of peace and socialism.

Comrades, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Socialist Republics, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Socialist Republics, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have authorized our delegation to send the following congratulatory telegram to you and, through you, to all the Hungarian people: To The Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic: To The Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People' Republic: To The Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party:

The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Socialist Republics, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Socialist Republics, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union extend to you, and through you to all the Hungarian people, our heartfelt congratulations on the tenth anniversary of the liberation of Hungary—a national holiday of the Hungarian People's Republic.

The Soviet people are delighted with the achievements of the Hungarian people in the struggle to lay the foundations of a socialist economy, develop the people's culture, and improve the material well-being of the working people.

We express our firm belief that the Hungarian people, under the guidance of the Hungarian Working People's Party and the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic, will continue to work tirelessly to achieve further success in the struggle to develop the national economy and culture and strengthen the people's democratic system.

For the sake of the interests of our two peoples, and to strengthen peace and security in Europe, may the unbreakable Soviet-Hungarian friendship be strengthened and developed!

### 在苏军解放匈牙利十周年庆祝大会上  克·叶·伏罗希洛夫同志的讲话

    在苏军解放匈牙利十周年庆祝大会上
    克·叶·伏罗希洛夫同志的讲话
    亲爱的同志们，在这个全国性的节日——匈牙利从希特勒占领下获得解放和在这个国家建立起人民政权十周年的时候，我谨代表苏联共产党中央委员会、苏联最高苏维埃和苏联政府，并代表苏联全体人民向你们致衷心的敬礼，并向你们和通过你们向全体匈牙利人民祝贺。
    十年前，英雄的苏联军队紧紧地追赶法西斯军队，进入了纳粹占领的匈牙利领土，到一九四五年四月四日就彻底击溃了法西斯希特勒的军队，把匈牙利从帝国主义侵略者手中解放出来。这个事件证明是匈牙利人民生活中的一个转折点。
    数百年来，爱好自由的匈牙利人民以非常的英雄气概和勇敢同土耳其、德奥和其他外国侵略者进行斗争，争取他们的民族独立和自由，但是由于不止一次地出卖了民族利益的匈牙利地主和资本家的罪恶政策，人民的希望不能实现。即使在第一次世界大战之后，当匈牙利正式成为一个独立的国家的时候，它仍然严重地依赖主要的帝国主义国家。直到苏军把法西斯占领者赶出了匈牙利，匈牙利人民才在他们的历史上第一次得到真正的机会来建立一个真正独立的和有主权的国家。
    苏联军队在作为一支解放军队进入匈牙利领土以后，给匈牙利人民以充分的自由来按照他们所希望的方式解决他们自己的事务，建立他们认为对他们自己最适宜的社会政治制度。
    匈牙利人民永远地结束了地主和资本家们的政治和经济统治，把政权拿到他们自己的手中并且建立了人民民主政权。
    因此，人民民主的匈牙利国家的建立不仅是匈牙利人民多年来争取民族独立的斗争的胜利结束的结果，而且也是匈牙利历史上的新纪元——一个人民民主的纪元和奠定社会主义基础的纪元——的开始。
    苏联人民像全世界所有爱好自由的各国人民一样，以真诚的高兴和非常满意的心情为光荣的匈牙利人民的这个具有历史意义的胜利欢呼。
    同志们，十多年以前，在一九四四年十二月二十一日匈牙利临时国民议会在得布勒森市（这个城市是在那一天以前不久解放的）举行的第一次会议上通过的“告匈牙利人民书”中宣布：“我们坚决相信匈牙利将开始日益繁荣。我们要奠定将成为强大的、幸福的匈牙利的基础，我们要看到匈牙利成为一个独立的国家”。
    匈牙利人民在这个告匈牙利人民书上表示的愿望已经实现了。
    自那时以来的十年是国家真正欣欣向荣和新生的年代，是在经济、政治和文化方面进行深刻的改革的年代，是匈牙利真正繁荣的年代。
    在这个匈牙利历史上具有历史意义的十年中，最重要的结果是人民在工人阶级领导下获得了政权，国家的真正独立和主权加强了，人民民主政权巩固了，以及为社会主义奠定基础的工作取得了巨大的成就。
    自从匈牙利人民得到解放的日子以来，他们就开始在工人阶级、首先是它的政党的领导下努力工作，来恢复国民经济和使国家民主化。
    新的人民政权所采取的一个非常重要的行动就是土地改革，它实现了千百万雇工、无地和少地的农民几世纪以来对土地的梦想。土地改革的完成，是一个具有巨大历史意义的发展，它根除了封建制度和地主制度的残余。使人民民主政权强大和不可动摇的工人阶级和劳动农民的战斗联盟在实行这次改革中加强了。
    匈牙利劳动人民在恢复国民经济方面的英勇的努力，是无论怎样估计也不算过高的。
    纳粹恶魔掠夺了这个国家，使得它的许多城市和村庄成为废墟。只有苏军的不可抵抗的攻势，才阻止了纳粹使它没有能够把匈牙利变成沙漠，没有能够剥夺匈牙利人民的住屋和面包，没有能够完全摧毁你们的美丽的首都布达佩斯。
    匈牙利的经济正是在反人民的势力进行猛烈抵抗的情况下恢复和发展的。敌人预言说，匈牙利国民经济的恢复需要几十年的工夫，而且，除非匈牙利得到美国百万富翁的援助，否则这种恢复工作是无法进行的。但是这些预言并没有实现。匈牙利的劳动人民已经克服了一切困难，他们不仅恢复了国民经济，而且沿着社会主义的道路重建了工业和运输业。
    大家知道，旧匈牙利是一个落后的农业国家，工业落后，而且大部分是由外国资本控制着的。匈牙利人民在短短的时间里便克服了国家工业的落后情况。只消追述这一点就够了：在第二次世界大战以前的二十年期间，旧匈牙利的所有的工厂和制造厂的总产量仅仅增加了百分之二十，而在人民民主政府下的头十年中的总产量却增加为战前的三倍，即每年平均的增加量高达百分之三十，而不是旧匈牙利时代的百分之一。农业的、工业落后的匈牙利已经成长为一个拥有先进的社会主义工业的国家。
    作为社会主义经济基础的重工业及其核心——机器制造业——一直在不断进展。煤、石油产量以及发电量在五年之中增加为两倍；机器、钢、钢材、铝和其他重要产品的产量已经增加为两倍以上。
    战前不存在的若干新的工业已经建立起来。对于国民经济极为重要的新机器和复杂的工作母机开始制造了。匈牙利人民以英雄的努力建立了新的工业中心，并且建立了许多工业企业。
    由于工业的胜利发展，国家已经创造了农业在新的、先进的社会基础上迅速发展的一切条件。
    在农业方面，匈牙利共和国在人民政府成立以来的年代中也肯定地获得了显著的进步。但是，匈牙利劳动人民党第三次代表大会正确地强调指出必须更进一步发展农业，并且在以后数年中大大扩大为充分满足国家日益增长的需要所必需的谷物、肉类、油脂和其他农产品的生产。这一个国民经济中最重要的问题的胜利解决和全体匈牙利人民都有着切身的关系。
    大家知道，个体农业增加农业生产的潜力是很有限的。使现代机器和科学农作的最新成就能够发挥最高效率的大规模社会主义农业生产，无疑地比个体农业优越。这一点不仅已为苏联社会主义建设的历史经验所证实，而且也为匈牙利本身的先进的农业生产合作社的经验所证实。
    匈牙利劳动人民党和匈牙利人民共和国政府正确地认为，只有通过农业的社会主义改造，农业生产才能真正地得到进步和发展。
    向前看的匈牙利农民在土地改革完成以后，马上便建立了第一批农业生产合作社。他们认为，集体农业经营不仅是建设繁荣生活而且也是满足他们日益增长的文化要求的唯一方法。从那时起，集体农业经营的观念便在匈牙利的农村中扎下了根。自那时起，成千上万的匈牙利农民认识到集体农业经营的好处，纷纷组成了生产合作社，现在生产合作社加上国营农场，共拥有全国耕地面积的三分之一。他们从切身的经验知道，集体农业经营保证获得比个体农民要大得多的收获量，较高的牲畜产品生产率和不断增加的现金和实物收入。
    匈牙利劳动人民党和人民政府对发展和加强生产合作社给以极大的注意，采取一切必要的措施来帮助它们扩大和发展，正在为了全体人民的利益协助由于种种原因没有参加合作社的个体农民来提高他们的农业生产。
    一年年不断增加的机器拖拉机站，开始在解决提高农业和按照社会主义的方针来改造农业的问题方面起着越来越重要的作用。全国农业拥有数以千计的拖拉机、收割联合机和其他现代农业机器。
    苏联人民衷心祝匈牙利劳动人民在完成农业的全面和迅速发展的困难而令人兴奋的任务时所获得巨大的成就。
    同志们，在过去十年中，匈牙利劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平有了很大的提高。由于匈牙利劳动人民党和匈牙利政府对增进人民福利的经常关怀，一向是旧日的匈牙利的真正灾难的失业已经消灭了，配给制——战争年代的遗产——取消了；食品和日用品的价格一直在逐步减低，而职工的实际工资以及劳动农民的收入正在不断提高。房屋建筑的规模日益扩大。
    人民政府最关心的是要使城乡劳动人民的生活水平提高，使他们日益增长的物质和文化要求得到满足。然而，必须特别着重地指出，只有通过扩大社会主义再生产和最大限度地提高生产率，通过进一步的社会主义工业化，才能胜利地完成这个任务。
    没有重工业的不断发展，就不可能提高劳动人民的生活水平，不可能发展农业和发展生活日用品的工业。伟大的列宁教导说，“社会主义的唯一物质基础，就是同时也能改造农业的大机器工业”。对列宁斯大林关于优先发展重工业的原则的任何违反，将不可避免地会破坏整个国民经济和削弱国家的经济力量和国防。
    匈牙利工人阶级认为他们的主要任务是竭力提高劳动生产率。我们伟大的导师列宁说，“劳动生产率，归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最重要、最主要的条件”。没有生产率的逐步提高，社会主义的最后胜利是不可想像的。
    匈牙利人民共和国在发展新文化——社会主义内容、民族形式的新文化方面有了很大的进展。在匈牙利历史上，文化和艺术第一次变成了广大人民群众的财产。在霍尔梯政权和君主专制统治的时候，高等学校的大门实际上是向劳动人民关着的。今天，工人、农民和劳动知识分子的子女在国内大学和其他高等教育机关中学习。从一九三八年以来，匈牙利高等学校的学生人数已经增为四倍。新的知识分子已经从同他们有不可分割的联系的人民中间成长起来。旧知识分子代表在建设社会主义的共同努力中也开始起适当的作用，并贡献他们的全部力量来为人民服务。
    匈牙利科学家、作家、艺术家、画家、雕刻家和作曲家获得了很大的成就。匈牙利文化的杰出人物的著作在我们国家内为大家所熟知，而且得到了苏联人民的应有的尊敬和热爱。
    同志们，在回顾人民政权下的光辉的十年的时候，人们不能不满意地注意到，党和人民的团结在他们争取社会主义胜利的斗争中越来越加强了。匈牙利劳动人民党是匈牙利人民的久经考验和百炼成钢的领导者，它得到他们的无限信任和热烈爱戴。匈牙利人民的精神上和政治上的团结的巩固，以及他们在工人阶级政党周围的紧密团结，是人民民主政权的不可战胜的力量和不断向着社会主义前进的保证。
    大家知道，在走向社会主义的道路上过去存在着而且现在还存在着不少困难和障碍。
    匈牙利劳动人民党正在克服这些困难，坚决地揭发错误和缺点，毫不犹豫地铲除所有各种脱离马克思列宁主义的偏向，从而正在满怀信心地领导着全国走向新的胜利。
    不久以前举行的匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会全体会议考虑了政治局势和党的任务。全体会议的决议对国民经济情况作了详细的分析，不仅指出了已经取得的进展，而且还指出了在社会主义建设过程中表现的错误和缺点，并且正确地规定了克服这些缺点的措施和巩固及发展人民民主制度的任务。全体会议的决议，不仅得到党的一致支持而且也得到全体人民的一致支持，这证明了这些决议是符合国家的切身利益的。
    苏联共产党认为匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会全体会议的决议是兄弟党在这个时候的战斗纲领。
    毫无疑问，匈牙利人民在劳动人民党和它的中央委员会的领导下，将在发展国家经济、提高劳动人民生活水平和在匈牙利建设社会主义的伟大事业中取得更大的成就。
    亲爱的同志们，匈牙利解放以来的十年，是匈牙利人民和苏联人民的友谊得到加强和发展的时期。
    在一九四八年二月十八日签订的苏匈友好合作互助条约以及苏联和各兄弟人民民主国家所签订的其他条约，有助于促进各国人民在互相尊重独立和主权的基础上的亲密合作。和平、民主和社会主义阵营国家之间的亲密合作，是加强安全的重要因素，是对全世界普通人民反对发动另一次战争的共同斗争的一个重要贡献。
    我们国家之间的友好关系是建筑在人民自己的根深蒂固的利益一致和国际团结的基础上的。苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家过去一直在、现在仍然在奉行着不变的和平政策，并且把它们和一切不论大小国家之间的关系建立在尊重各国人民的主权和真正的民族独立以及平等、互利、互不干涉内政的原则上。
    所有这些就保证了各国——不论社会和政治制度如何——和平共处的可能性。
    以美利坚合众国为首的帝国主义国家的统治集团在国际关系中奉行的政策是完全相反的政策。他们正在尽一切力量来阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和，而且正在公开地准备一场新战争。他们正在加紧进行军备竞赛和原子武器生产，使战争预算膨胀到空前未有的程度，建筑越来越多的军事基地以便进攻苏联、中国以及和平和社会主义阵营的其他国家，并且拼凑侵略集团。
    在欧洲，他们竭力要复活德国军国主义，一心要使它成为他们正在策划的侵略的攻击部队。在亚洲，他们正在建立矛头指向伟大的中国人民和已经走上民主发展道路的其他各国人民的军事联盟和集团，支持蒋介石集团，在他们非法强占的台湾地区向中华人民共和国挑衅，而且干涉中国的内政。
    在欧洲和亚洲的若干国家中建立的人民民主制度是帝国主义反动派所不喜欢的。他们梦想以资本主义秩序来代替那些国家中的人民民主制度，梦想把压迫和剥削的枷锁强加在劳动人民的身上。但是，各国人民不希望回到过去的万恶的资本主义时代去，而且他们一定能够——假如有必要的话——保卫他们自己和他们建立起来的人民民主制度，对付这些无耻的进攻。
    和平、民主和社会主义阵营的各国人民认识到，若干国家的帝国主义分子的复活德国军国主义的顽固企图对他们的安全造成了越来越大的危险，因此不得不采取必要的步骤来加强他们的防御，以便用他们的联合力量来对付侵略势力。八个欧洲国家的代表在他们去年十二月在莫斯科举行的会议上同意采取必要的步骤来组织他们的武装部队和建立一个联合司令部，就是为了这个目的。
    巴黎协定的批准已经根本地改变了国际局势。
    真的，英国下院和法国国民议会只有少数议员投票赞成批准使和平事业遭受危险的巴黎协定。大家知道，这些国家和其他国家的人民正在对复活侵略性的和复仇主义的德国国防军的政策进行正义的和积极的抵抗。只是在美国的侵略集团和他们的同谋者的压力下各国议会才违反人民的意志批准巴黎协定的。
    由于巴黎协定被批准，世界关系的紧张局势肯定是加剧了，新战争的危险增加了。苏联和人民民主国家的人民将从这个事实中得出一切必要的结论，并将动员他们的力量来加强他们国家的经济力量和防御能力。
    社会主义阵营国家的人民坚决相信他们的力量和他们的取之不尽的资源。和平和社会主义阵营从来没有像今天这样强大、这样如磐石一般的巩固。我们的人民正在作，而且将继续作一切必要的努力来防止新战争。但是要让战争贩子们知道，如果他们把另一次战争强加于人类，那就该他们倒霉。民主国家的人民已经一再声明，他们不要将会给千百万人类带来不可估量的痛苦和灾难的战争。他们的目的就是保卫和平，和使各国人民可能享受和平和安静的人类生活的伟大幸福。
    巴黎协定已经批准了，但是要阻止它们的执行和防止发动新战争的最危险因素的德国军国主义的复活为时还不算晚。
    这是包括德国人民在内的各国人民的利益所要求的。德国人民需要和平，他们需要一个重新统一的、和平的德国，而不是一个由希特勒的匪帮将军们率领的国防军。
    苏联政府不止一次地表明它的目的在于缓和国际紧张局势和用和平方式解决纠纷的主动精神。苏联政府的这种和平主动精神得到全世界有进步思想的群众的热烈欢迎和赞同，各国的广大人民群众的同情是在我们这一边的。和平的力量每天都在增长，它们今天已经比战争和侵略势力强大得多了。
    亲爱的同志们，让我向你们表示我的坚定的信心：今天庆祝他们的解放十周年的英勇的匈牙利人民，将对进一步加强和平和社会主义力量的共同事业作出有价值的贡献。
    同志们，苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃主席团、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会授权我们代表团向你们并通过你们向全体匈牙利人民致下列贺电：匈牙利人民共和国主席团：匈牙利人民共和国部长会议：匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会：

    苏联人民为匈牙利人民在奠定社会主义经济的基础、发展人民的文化和提高劳动人民物质水平的斗争中所取得的成就而欢欣鼓舞。
    我们表示坚决相信：匈牙利人民在匈牙利劳动人民党和匈牙利人民共和国政府的领导下，将继续坚持不懈地努力，在发展国民经济和文化以及加强人民民主制度的斗争中取得进一步的成就。
