    Farmers in Daxing County are transforming the alkaline wasteland in the Lucheng area on the east bank of the Yongding River. It is estimated that 7,000 mu of alkaline wetland can be developed into paddy fields this year. Currently, thousands of laborers are digging three large water weirs to serve as water sources for the paddy fields. More than twenty villages, including Lucheng, are close to the Yongding River, with low terrain and high water levels, making it impossible to drain rainwater. In previous years, farmers in these villages only grew sorghum and corn. In years with less waterlogging, they could harvest a maximum of 120 jin, and usually only 60 to 70 jin. Every year, many people had to flee the famine. Now, under the unified leadership of the county, the farmers in these villages are planning to transform these alkaline wastelands into paddy fields. According to last year's experimental results, each mu of paddy field can yield 400 jin. There are more than 35,000 mu of alkaline land in this area, and it is estimated that all of it can be developed into paddy fields in three years. (Our correspondent in Baoding)

    大兴农民正在改造碱荒地
    河北省大兴县正在改造永定河东岸芦城一带的碱荒地，预计今年可将七千亩碱湿地开拓为稻田。现在，数千民工正在挖掘三个大水堰，作为稻田的水源。芦城等二十多个村子临近永定河，地势低，水位高，雨水无处排泄。历年这些村庄的农民只种些高粱、玉米，在地水较小的年头，最多只能收一百二十斤，一般只能收六七十斤。每年不知道有多少人要向外逃荒。现在，这些村庄的农民在县的统一领导下，正在有计划的把这些碱荒地改变成稻田，根据去年实验的结果，每亩稻田可收四百斤。在这一地区一共有三万五千多亩碱地，预计三年之后可全部开拓成稻田。　（本报驻保定记者）
