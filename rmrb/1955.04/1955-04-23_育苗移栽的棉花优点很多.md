    Cotton Grown by Seedling Transplanting Has Many Advantages
    Dai Zai
    In areas where wheat and cotton are double-cropped, cotton is often sown after the wheat harvest, resulting in late maturity, low yields, and poor quality. Additionally, late cotton maturity also affects autumn plowing. This is the case with cotton cultivation in the eastern Sichuan Province's Chuandong region. The Wanxian Mountainous Area Agricultural Experiment Station in this province, in order to solve this problem, has been conducting cotton seedling transplanting experiments since 1952. The results of three years of experimentation have been very good.
    In 1954, this farm conducted cotton transplanting on a large area of 10.2 mu, and at the same time used 30 mu of direct-sown cotton as a comparative experiment. The transplanted cotton was sown on March 28 for seedling cultivation, and transplanted on May 10 after the wheat harvest and land preparation. The direct-sown cotton and the transplanted cotton were sown at the same time. The experimental results showed that the transplanted cotton began to bud on June 4, 36 days earlier than the direct-sown cotton; the initial flowering period was on June 29, 28 days earlier than the direct-sown cotton; the initial boll opening was on August 2, also 28 days earlier than the direct-sown cotton; and the peak boll opening period was from late August to early September, with cotton picking and stalk removal completed before mid-October.
    The yield and quality of cotton grown by seedling transplanting have been significantly improved. The average yield of seed cotton from transplanted cotton was 279 jin per mu, 102 jin more than the average yield of direct-sown cotton. The transplanted cotton had early and concentrated boll opening, with more white cotton and fewer unopened bolls. The direct-sown cotton, due to rain during the peak boll opening period, had a unopened boll rate more than twice that of the transplanted cotton, and the ginning percentage was also lower than that of the transplanted cotton, and the cotton fiber was also shorter.
    Cotton grown by seedling transplanting is easy to manage during the seedling stage in the seedbed, and it is easy to prevent and control diseases and insect pests. Although it requires more labor during transplanting, there are fewer weeds in the later stage, and the phenomenon of rapid cotton growth is also less common. Therefore, it saves labor in terms of intertillage, pest control, and pruning. According to experiments, planting cotton by transplanting method requires an average of 29.7 man-days per mu, saving 1.5 man-days per mu compared to direct sowing. Transplanting requires only 2 jin of cotton seeds per mu, while direct sowing requires 8 jin of cotton seeds. The average net income per mu of transplanted cotton reached 30 yuan, 3 jiao and 1 fen, an increase of 19 yuan, 3 jiao and 5 fen per mu compared to direct sowing.
    From the results of the transplanted cotton experiments conducted by the Wanxian Mountainous Area Agricultural Experiment Station, adopting the seedling transplanting method for cotton planting in cotton-wheat double-cropping areas can achieve timely sowing and improve the yield and quality of cotton. All cotton-producing areas, especially those lacking cotton seeds this year and cotton-wheat double-cropping areas, can conduct experiments based on this experience.

    育苗移栽的棉花优点很多
    戴载
    棉麦两熟地区的棉花多在麦收以后播种，成熟迟，产量低，品质也不好；同时由于棉花成熟迟，也影响到秋耕。四川省川东一带棉花种植的情况就是这样的。这个省的万县山区农业试验场，为了解决这个问题，从一九五二年起，进行了棉花育苗移栽试验；经过三年试验效果很好。
    这个农场一九五四年在十亩二分的大面积上进行棉花移栽，同时用三十亩直播的棉花同它做对比试验。移栽的棉花是在三月二十八日播种育苗的，收麦整地后，在五月十日移栽。直播的棉花和移栽的棉花同时播种。试验结果，育苗移栽的棉花，开始现蕾在六月四日，比直播的早三十六天；初花期在六月二十九日，比直播的早二十八天；吐絮初期在八月二日，比直播的也早二十八天；吐絮盛期在八月下旬到九月上旬，十月中旬前，收棉拔秆完毕。
    育苗移栽的棉花的产量和品质都有显著提高。移栽的棉花平均每亩产籽棉二百七十九斤，比直播的平均产量多一百零二斤。移栽的棉花吐絮早而集中，白花产量多，僵瓣少；直播的棉花因在吐絮盛期遇雨，僵瓣率高出移栽的一倍以上，衣分率也比移栽的低，棉花纤维也短。
    育苗移栽的棉花在苗床培育期间管理方便，对病虫容易防治，移栽时虽然比较费工，但后期杂草减少，棉花猛长现象也少，因而在中耕、治虫、整枝等方面都比较省工。根据试验，用移栽方法植棉，平均每亩共需二十九点七个人工，比直播的每亩节省人工一个半；移栽的每亩只需棉籽二斤，直播的需棉籽八斤；移栽的棉花平均每亩纯收益达三十元零三角一分，比直播的每亩增加收入十九元三角五分。
    从万县山区农业试验场所进行的移栽棉花试验的结果来看，棉麦两熟地区采用育苗移栽方法植棉，就可以作到适时播种和提高棉花的产量和质量。各产棉区，特别是今年缺乏棉种的地区和棉麦两熟地区，可以根据这一经验进行试验。
