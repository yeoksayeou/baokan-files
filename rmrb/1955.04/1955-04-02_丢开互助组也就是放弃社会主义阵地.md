Abandoning Mutual Aid Teams Means Abandoning the Socialist Position
		Jian Hong
	While agricultural producers' cooperatives have developed extensively, in many regions, mutual aid teams have disintegrated or collapsed due to lack of supervision, or have experienced abnormal development.
	In some regions, the leading cadres in charge have almost completely ignored the affairs of mutual aid teams; some district and township cadres are unaware of how many mutual aid teams exist in their own townships. They believe that "consolidating agricultural producers' cooperatives is important, and mutual aid teams can be put on hold for the time being," or that "as long as the cooperatives are active, the teams will naturally follow." A prevailing attitude has developed among district and township cadres that establishing agricultural producers' cooperatives is glorious, while engaging in mutual aid teams is "unpromising." They are aware of the problems in mutual aid teams but do not address them.
	Under such circumstances of neglect and lack of attention, many mutual aid teams that could have been consolidated and improved have disintegrated and even collapsed. In Youxi County, Fujian Province, the number of farming households joining cooperatives accounts for 20% of the county's total; however, in some townships, all mutual aid teams have collapsed. The Du Mingqing mutual aid team in Donggou Township, Echeng County, Hubei Province, was a relatively advanced mutual aid team (with unified management of sideline production) that gradually developed while continuously overcoming disasters. The team members had a high level of enthusiasm for mutual aid and were preparing to transition to a cooperative. However, some problems within the team could not be resolved, and despite repeatedly requesting assistance from the leadership, they received none. Eventually, small problems escalated into larger ones, and they were forced to disband. Many mutual aid teams have collapsed in this manner throughout the country; some townships have become blank slates with no mutual aid teams. In some townships, only a few agricultural producers' cooperatives have begun spring plowing, while the majority of farmers outside the cooperatives and mutual aid teams have not yet started. Some teams, while not collapsing on the surface, have low morale, and some members are already working independently.
	Do the many farmers outside the cooperatives no longer need mutual aid? Clearly, this is not the case. In the current spring plowing and disaster relief efforts, many farmers still urgently require mutual aid. They (including some middle peasants) face various specific difficulties in individual production and overcoming disasters; at the same time, they have realized that mutual aid can indeed solve many problems. Therefore, while many mutual aid teams are spontaneously collapsing, many abnormal mutual aid teams are spontaneously forming. Some rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants with more pronounced capitalist ideas, seeing an opportunity to exploit, use their advantage in means of production to deceive and intimidate impoverished farmers, infiltrating mutual aid teams or organizing fake teams under the banner of "mutual aid teams." In many areas of Heilongjiang and Liaoning provinces, some such "mutual aid teams" have already appeared. In the fifth district of Hulan County, Heilongjiang Province, out of the 56 mutual aid teams in 15 villages, three were formed by landlords coming together for "mutual aid," five were controlled by new rich peasants, and eleven were organized independently by households with "strong labor and robust horses." "Mutual aid teams" controlled by rich peasants try to raise the prices of ox-drawn plowing and lower the prices of labor, seriously exploiting impoverished households with fewer carts and no horses, and doing everything possible to obstruct team members from joining cooperatives. Some rich peasants even organize rich peasant teams to oppose agricultural producers' cooperatives.
	The seriousness of the problem is already very clear: if we abandon a rural position, capitalism will inevitably occupy that position. Abandoning mutual aid teams and all kinds of laissez-faire attitudes can only play a destructive and obstructive role in the cooperative movement. Failing to lead and assist mutual aid teams means placing the vast number of farmers who urgently need mutual assistance to overcome difficulties in a state of poverty and exploitation; it can only have a negative impact on completing this year's arduous agricultural production tasks. Who benefits from abandoning leadership over mutual aid teams? It can be said that it only benefits landlords and rich peasants who attempt to continue their exploitation, and benefits capitalism. In order to complete the agricultural production plan, for the healthy development of the agricultural collectivization movement, and for the entire socialist cause, we should quickly help the disintegrated mutual aid teams solve specific problems and consolidate them; we should rectify and reorganize the degenerated mutual aid teams and remove the saboteurs; we should establish a system of connection between cooperatives and teams, and constantly consolidate and improve mutual aid teams by using the power of the masses. The facts in many places have already proven that this is possible and effective. As long as we have a correct understanding of the status of mutual aid teams in the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, specific methods can be found to lead both agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams well.

    丢开互助组也就是放弃社会主义阵地
    剑虹
    在大量发展了农业生产合作社的同时，许多地区的互助组却因为没有人管而涣散、垮台了，或者发生了畸形发展的现象。
    有些地区的主要负责干部，几乎早已不闻不问互助组的事情了；有些区乡干部竟不知本乡还有几个互助组。他们认为：“巩固农业生产合作社重要，互助组可以暂放一下。”或者认为：“只要社动起来，组自然就会跟着走。”在区乡干部中已形成一种风气，只觉得办农业生产合作社光荣，而认为搞互助组“没有出息”。他们明知互助组有问题，也不去管。
    在这种没人管、没人问的情况下，许多可以巩固可以提高的互助组，却由涣散以至垮台了。福建省尤溪县入社农户已占全县总农户的百分之二十；可是，有些乡的互助组却全部垮台了。湖北省鄂城县东沟乡杜明清互助组，是在不断战胜灾荒的情况下，逐渐发展起来的一个比较高级的互助组（副业生产已进行了统一经营），组员的互助情绪很高，并且准备转社。但是组内还有一些问题不能解决，他们一次再次地要求领导帮助，总求不着，终于由小问题变大问题，最后不得已地散伙了。各地像这样垮台的互助组很多；有些乡已变成了没有互助组的空白点。有些乡只有几个农业生产合作社搞起了春耕生产，大部分社外农民和互助组还都没有动起来。有些组虽然表面上没垮，但情绪很低，有的已各干各的了。
    社外的许多农民，是不是不需要互助了呢？显然不是这样的。在当前的春耕生产和生产救灾中，许多农民仍然迫切要求互助。他们（包括一些中农在内）单独生产和克服灾荒有种种具体困难；同时，他们也已体会到互助起来确实能解决不少问题。因此，一方面许多互助组自流地垮台，一方面又自流地成立起了许多畸形的互助组。一些富农和资本主义思想比较严重的富裕中农，看到有空子可钻，就利用他们在生产资料上的优势，欺骗和恐吓贫困农民，钻进了互助组，或者打起“互助组”的旗子组织假组。黑龙江省和辽宁省不少地区已出现了一些这样的“互助组”。黑龙江省呼兰县第五区的十五个村，五十六个互助组中就有三个是地主碰到一起“互助”的，五个是由新富农把持的，十一个是“人强马壮”的户单独组织的。被富农掌握了的“互助组”，尽量提高牛犋工价，压低劳力工价，对少车没马的贫困户，进行着严重的剥削，并且千方百计阻挠组员入社。还有些富农自己组织富农组，和农业生产合作社对抗。
    问题的严重性已经可以看得很明白：如果我们放弃了一块农村阵地，资本主义就必然会去占领这块阵地。放弃互助组的行为和种种自流论，对合作化运动只能起破坏和阻碍的作用。不领导和帮助互助组，就是把迫切要求互相帮助克服困难的广大农民放到贫困和任人剥削的境地；对完成今年繁重的农业生产任务，也只能起坏的影响。放弃对互助组的领导，究竟对谁有利呢？可以说：只是对企图继续进行剥削的地主、富农有利，对资本主义有利。为了完成农业生产计划，为了农业合作化运动的健康发展，为了整个社会主义事业，应该赶快帮助涣散了的互助组解决具体问题，使它们巩固起来；应该把变质了的互助组加以整顿改组，把破坏分子清除出去；应该建立起社带动组的联系制度，运用群众的力量不断地巩固和提高互助组。许多地方的事实已经证明，这样做是可能的，而且是有效的。只要对互助组在农业生产互助合作运动中的地位有正确的认识，把农业生产合作社和互助组同时领导好的具体办法是可以找到的。
