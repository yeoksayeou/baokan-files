Leaders and Spokespersons of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, China Democratic League, and China National Democratic Construction Association Issue Statements
Angrily Denouncing the Murderous Crimes of American-Chiang Kai-shek Secret Agents

    (Our dispatch) The Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Li Jishen, the Acting Chairman of the China Democratic League, Shen Junru, and the spokesperson for the China National Democratic Construction Association, issued statements on April 14th regarding the incident of American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agent organizations murdering personnel of our delegation to the Asian-African Conference and Chinese and foreign journalists, as follows:
    Li Jishen said: The planned conspiracy by American and Chiang Kai-shek secret agent organizations to murder personnel of our delegation attending the Asian-African Conference once again exposes the heinous nature of American imperialism, which is hostile to the People's Republic of China, opposes all peace-loving countries, and sabotages all undertakings conducive to international peace and cooperation. We express our utmost anger at this utterly shameless crime of American imperialism! We firmly support the Chinese delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai in participating in the Asian-African Conference and making contributions to the peace of the Far East and the peace of the world together with delegations from various countries.
    Shen Junru said: Regarding the crime of American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents murdering personnel of our delegation to the Asian-African Conference, I, on behalf of the China Democratic League, express boundless anger. American imperialism is deliberately pursuing its policy of aggression in Asia and Africa. It fears that this conference attended by twenty-nine Asian and African countries, which aims to maintain peace and oppose colonialism, will be successful, so it is carrying out sabotage from all sides. However, the Chinese people's determination to fight to the end for peace in the Far East and the world is unwavering. We, the Chinese people, will be more vigilant and take more diligent action to support the just cause of the Chinese delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai in working together with delegations from other Asian and African countries for peace.
    The spokesperson for the China National Democratic Construction Association said: We express infinite anger at this murderous crime of American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Our six hundred million people must settle accounts for this crime of American and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents! People all over the world know that the convening of the Asian-African Conference marks a major change in the world situation. It will promote friendship and cooperation among Asian and African countries, and therefore American imperialism is deliberately trying to sabotage this conference. The Chinese people must make the greatest efforts to support all the activities of our delegation, and we must join the peace-loving people of the world in resolutely repelling the sabotage activities of American and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents!

    民革民盟民建负责人和发言人发表谈话
    愤怒斥责美蒋特务的谋杀罪行
    本报讯　中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深、中国民主同盟代主席沈钧儒和中国民主建国会发言人，在四月十四日就美蒋特务机关谋杀我国参加亚非会议的代表团工作人员和中外记者的事件发表谈话如下。
    李济深说：美国和蒋匪特务机关有计划地阴谋杀害我国出席亚非会议的代表团人员事件，再一次暴露了美帝国主义敌视中华人民共和国、反对一切爱好和平的国家、破坏一切有利于国际和平合作事业的罪恶面目。我们对于美帝国主义这种无耻透顶的罪行，表示万分的愤怒！我们坚决拥护以周恩来总理为首的中国代表团参加亚非会议，和各国代表团一起为远东和平和世界和平作出贡献。
    沈钧儒说：对于美蒋特务谋杀我国参加亚非会议代表团人员的罪行，我代表中国民主同盟表示无比的愤怒。美帝国主义蓄意在亚非两洲推行其侵略政策，它唯恐这个有二十九个亚非国家参加的、旨在维护和平、反对殖民主义的会议开成功，所以从各方面进行破坏。但是，中国人民为远东和世界和平而奋斗到底的决心是坚定不移的。我们中国人民将更加提高警惕，更加以努力工作的行动来支持以周恩来总理为首的中国代表团同亚非其他国家的代表团一起为和平而奋斗的正义事业。
    中国民主建国会发言人说：我们对美国帝国主义者和蒋介石匪帮的这一谋杀罪行，表示无限的愤怒。我国六万万人民一定要清算美、蒋特务这种罪行！全世界的人民都知道，亚非会议的召开，标志着世界局势的重大变化，它将促进亚洲、非洲各国的亲善和合作，因而美国帝国主义才蓄意要破坏这个会议。中国人民一定要以最大的努力来支持我国代表团的一切活动，一定要同全世界爱好和平的人民一道给美、蒋特务的破坏活动以坚决的回击！
