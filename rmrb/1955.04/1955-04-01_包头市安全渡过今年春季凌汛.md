    Baotou City Safely Overcomes This Year's Spring Ice Jam
    Since the Yellow River in the western part of Inner Mongolia entered the thaw stage, seven ice dams and twenty-three ice bridges had formed in the river channels around Zhongtan, Baotou, and Sarachi County on March 26th and 27th. At noon on the 27th, ice floes from the upstream Zhongtan section flowed to the Duanjia Haizi section on the outskirts of Baotou City, where they were blocked by unmelted black ice in the river bend. The accumulated ice floes hindered flood discharge, and the water level rose continuously, threatening the urban area of Baotou.
    On the same day, the Deputy Mayor of Baotou City personally led laborers to the dam for emergency repairs. The Director of the Inner Mongolia Yellow River Ice Prevention Joint Headquarters also went to the head of the Duanjia Haizi River to observe the ice situation. At 4:20 p.m., the Ice Prevention Headquarters ordered the Ice Prevention Air Force to take off and bomb ice dams and blockages at the head of the Duanjia Haizi River and Sidagu and other places to protect the safety of Baotou City. At 5:20 p.m., the aircraft took off for bombing, and it only took eight bombs to open the ice dams and blockages in the above two places. The water level immediately began to drop.
    While the aircraft were bombing the ice dams, artillery units on various riverfront positions also bombarded the ice dams and ice bridges. In the intense two-day and two-night ice prevention battle, the Ice Prevention Air Force and artillery units opened six ice dams and three ice bridges, and the remaining ice dams and ice bridges were washed away by the flood. By the evening of March 28th, the Yellow River channel west of Baotou City was completely open, and this industrial city in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region safely overcame this year's spring ice jam.

    包头市安全渡过今年春季凌汛
    内蒙西部地区黄河进入开河阶段以来，在三月二十六日和二十七日这两天当中，中滩、包头和萨拉齐县一带河道上曾结冰坝七座、冰桥二十三个。二十七日中午，从上游中滩段流到包头市郊段家海子的冰块，被河湾里尚未溶化的黑冰挡住了。积存下来的流冰阻碍了洪水渲泄，水位连续上涨，包头市区受到洪水的威胁。
    当天，包头市副市长亲自率领民工上坝抢险。内蒙古黄河防凌联合指挥部主任委员也亲往段家海子河头观察冰情。下午四点二十分，防凌指挥部命令防凌空军出动，前往段家海子河头和四大股等地轰炸冰坝、卡冰，保卫包头市的安全。五点二十分，飞机起飞轰炸，仅用了八枚炸弹就将以上两处冰坝、卡冰打开。水位紧接着开始下降。
    在飞机轰炸冰坝的同时，各个沿河阵地上的炮兵部队也纷纷地轰击冰坝、冰桥。在两天两夜紧张激烈的防凌战斗中，防凌空军和炮兵部队，共打开冰坝六座、冰桥三个，其余的冰坝、冰桥都被洪水冲开。到三月二十八日晚上，包头市以西的黄河河道全部开通，内蒙古自治区这座工业城市便安全地渡过了今年春季的凌汛。　（杨争）
