    Purging Bad Elements During Socialist Rectification in Tongxian Prefecture

    During the rectification of agricultural production cooperatives in various counties of Tongxian Prefecture, Hebei Province, landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries who had infiltrated the cooperatives were purged, further clarifying class boundaries and purifying and consolidating the organizations of the cooperatives.

    Last winter, when Tongxian Prefecture expanded its agricultural production cooperatives, inadequate preparation allowed many landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries to take the opportunity to infiltrate the cooperatives. After entering the cooperatives, these bad elements engaged in various forms of sabotage. For example, Dong Xisheng, a rich peasant in Xifu Village, Shunyi County, who had previously served as a puppet Bao head under the Japanese, began to sabotage the cooperative's production tools shortly after joining the cooperative, inciting animal keepers not to take good care of the livestock, causing the animals to starve to death. Hu Ke'an, a former Japanese and puppet regime intelligence officer in Lugezhuang, infiltrated the cooperative and became an accountant. He secretly wooed members, attempting to seize leadership of the cooperative, and deliberately messed up the accounts. During this rectification, members exposed their destructive activities and purged them from the cooperative. The middle and poor peasants within the cooperative became more united, and the members' enthusiasm for production generally increased.

    通县专区整社中清除坏分子
    河北省通县专区各县在整顿农业生产合作社中，清除了混入社内的地主、富农、反革命分子，进一步划清了阶级界限，纯洁和巩固了合作社的组织。
    去年冬天，通县专区各地扩大农业生产合作社时，由于准备不够充分，致不少地主、富农和反革命分子乘机混入社中，这些坏分子入社后便多方进行破坏，例如：顺义县西府村曾当过伪保长的富农董希胜，混入社后不久，即开始破坏社的生产工具，煽动饲养员不要好好饲养牲畜，叫牲畜饿死。鲁各庄原日伪情报员胡克安混入社内充当会计以后，暗中拉拢社员，企图夺取社的领导权，并故意搞乱账目。在这次整社中，社员们揭发了他们的破坏活动并把他们清除出社后，社内中贫农更加团结、社员生产情绪也普遍提高。
