Shandong farmers are universally starting to sow early autumn crops such as sorghum, corn, and millet. In the Linyi Special District, the planting of early autumn sorghum and corn is basically completed. Feicheng County has planted 57,000 mu of hemp according to plan. This year, all localities have generally emphasized technical guidance work. Wendeng, Kunlun, Rongcheng, and other counties have convened meetings of district assistants and district technical extension station chiefs to study the organization of the masses to carry out seed selection, seed soaking, and seed dressing. The En County Technical Extension Station convened technicians from nine agricultural production cooperatives with a foundation to specifically explain and guide practice in cotton vernalization methods. The Fifth District of Sishui County plans to plant more than 35,000 mu of sorghum, of which more than 19,500 mu have been soaked, and more than 6,000 mu have been dressed. Seventy percent of farmers in Rongcheng County have carried out seed soaking. The Sixth District of Gaotang County selected more than 50,000 jin of cotton seeds, accounting for 70% of the seed usage.

    山东农民紧张进行春播
    山东省农民普遍开始播种高粱、玉米、谷子等早秋作物。临沂专区的早秋高粱、玉米已经基本种完；肥城县已经按计划种麻五万七千亩。各地今年一般都重视了技术指导工作。文登、昆仑、荣城等县都曾召开区助理员、区技术推广站长会议，研究了组织群众进行选种、浸种、拌种的工作。恩县技术推广站召集九个有基础的农业生产合作社的技术员开会，具体讲解并指导实习了棉花春化处理方法。泗水县第五区计划种高粱三万五千多亩，经过浸种的有一万九千五百亩，经过拌种的有六千多亩。荣城县百分之七十的农户都进行了浸种工作。高唐县第六区共粒选棉种五万多斤，占用种量的百分之七十。　（朱志广）
