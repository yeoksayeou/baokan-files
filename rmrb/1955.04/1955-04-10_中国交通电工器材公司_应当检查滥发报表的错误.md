    China Transport Electrical Equipment Company
    Should Check the Errors of Indiscriminate Issuance of Reports

    To the Editor:

    Two months ago, the manager of the China Transport Electrical Equipment Company sent a private letter to the managers of provincial companies, instructing the provincial companies to investigate and compile statistics on the purchase, sale, and processing figures for 1954. Attached were five complex report forms.

    The report forms issued by the China National Electrical Appliances Company are divided into nine major categories, and each category requires detailed reporting. According to the requirements of the report forms, it is necessary to go to the grassroots stores to find the commodity account books and sales slips for a year to complete the statistics from scratch. In this way, only one place would require thirty people to work for a month. If such figures are to be compiled at the provincial and national levels, it is really unknown how much manpower would be wasted. These report forms are not only unreasonable, but also do not comply with legal procedures. After studying with the provincial statistical bureau and the department of commerce, the Heilongjiang Provincial Company decided to refuse to fill them out. According to Article 8 of the "Provisional Measures for the Formulation and Approval of Investigation and Statistical Report Forms" promulgated by the National Bureau of Statistics: "All statistical report forms and investigation programs issued after approval procedures in accordance with these measures shall be legal report forms... All statistical report forms issued without legal approval procedures, as well as written investigation outlines similar to statistical report forms, shall be illegal report forms, and government agencies, enterprises, and organizations at all levels shall be responsible for exposing them and refusing to fill them out." The Heilongjiang Provincial Electrical Appliances Company felt that these complex report forms were impossible to fill out, so they called the head office for instructions, stating that they could not find the materials. The head office replied, "Estimate it." The provincial company then stated that they could not estimate without materials, and the head office said, "Then forget about it!" When the China National Electrical Appliances Company issued these investigation and statistical tables, the requirements were very urgent. The Heilongjiang Provincial Company received the letter and report forms on January 5th, and the letter requested that they be filled out and sent to the head office before January 10th. Another correction letter was received on January 7th, and later they said, "Forget about it!" This shows that their initial decision was very hasty, and it is no wonder that this decision would reach the result of "forget about it." It would be beneficial for the China National Electrical Appliances Company to seriously examine why this error occurred.

### 中国交通电工器材公司  应当检查滥发报表的错误

    中国交通电工器材公司
    应当检查滥发报表的错误编辑同志：
    两个月以前，中国交通电工器材公司经理给各省公司经理一封便信，布置各省公司调查统计一九五四年购进、销售和加工等数字。还附有五张复杂的报表。
    中国交电总公司颁发的报表内容共分九大类，要求每类都要详细填报。如果按照报表的要求必须到基层商店找出一年的商品账本和售货小票从头统计才能完成，这样一来，只一个地方就需要三十个人做一个月。如果在全省、全国范围内统计这样的数字，真不知要浪费多大的人力。这套报表不但不合情理，而且也不合乎法定的手续，黑龙江省公司同省统计局和商业厅研究后决定拒绝填报。根据国家统计局颁布的“关于制定及审批调查统计报表的暂行办法”中第八条规定：“凡遵照本办法规定经过审批手续所颁发的统计报表及调查方案，即为法定报表……一切未依法经过审批手续颁发的统计报表，以及类似统计报表的文字调查提纲，均为非法报表，各级政府机关、企业、团体均应负责揭发并拒绝填报。”黑龙江省交电公司对这套复杂的报表，感到无法填报，就打电话请示总公司，提出找不到材料，总公司答复说“估计一下”，省公司又提出没有材料无法估计，总公司就说：“那就算了吧！”中国交电总公司在发这套调查统计表的时候，要求是十分急迫的，黑龙江省公司在一月五日接到信和报表，信中要求在一月十日前填好送总公司，一月七日又接到了一封更正信，后来又说“算了吧！”这说明他们开初的决定是很轻率的，这也难怪这个决定要达到“算了吧”的结果。中国交电总公司为什么发生这个错误，认真检查一下是有好处的。　　杨砚峰
