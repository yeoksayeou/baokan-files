Gansu Province Discovers a Huge Coalfield

    A huge coalfield has been discovered in the Heishan area of Gansu Province. Based on existing partial data alone, the coal reserves are equal to four times the total reserves of the Lanzhou Aganzhen coal mining area, and the quality is good, with some of the coal capable of being used to produce coking coal. The discovery of this coalfield is of great significance for meeting the needs of Lanzhou industry, supporting the coal consumption of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang and Baotou-Lanzhou railways, and developing the economy of the local Mongolian people.
    Heishan is located in the southeastern part of the Mongolian Autonomous Region of Gansu Province, not far from the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway which is under construction. During the exploration of this huge coalfield, the workers received active support from nearby Mongolian and Han farmers and herders. They helped the exploration workers build transportation roads to the mining area in the desert. Cai Shujin, a farmer from Hongshui Township, far from the mining area, risked wind and sand to return fourteen sheep lost by the exploration team from seventy miles away and said excitedly, "We people here are hoping you will find treasure soon."
    Currently, the exploration design for this mining area has been completed. Hundreds of tons of machinery and materials are being shipped from Xi'an and other places. The first batch of staff from the Northwest Geological Bureau's 648 Geological Exploration Team has arrived in the mining area and are actively building houses, roads, and reservoirs, and have begun measuring the drilling baselines. Large-scale drilling, trenching, and shallow well exploration work will begin in early May. (Our correspondent in Lanzhou)

    甘肃省发现一个巨大的煤田
    甘肃省黑山地区发现一个巨大的煤田。仅据现有部分资料判断，煤藏量等于兰州阿干镇煤矿区总储量的四倍，而且质量良好，一部分煤炭能炼制焦煤。这一煤田的发现对满足兰州工业的需要和支援兰新、包兰铁路运输用煤，以及对发展当地蒙族人民经济具有重大意义。
    黑山在甘肃省蒙族自治区东南部，和正在修建的包兰铁路相距不远。在这一巨大煤田的勘探期间，职工们受到附近蒙、汉族农牧民的积极支援。他们帮助勘探职工在沙漠上修筑通往矿区的运输大道；远离矿区的红水乡农民蔡书金，曾冒着风沙从七十里地以外把勘探队遗失的十四只羊送回工地，并激动地说：“我们这里人都盼着你们早些找出宝来。”
    目前，这个矿区的勘探设计已经完成。数百吨机器、物资正从西安等地启运。西北地质局六四八地质勘探队的首批工作人员已到达矿区，正积极修建房屋、道路、水库，并开始了钻孔基线的测量。五月初，大规模的钻探、槽探和浅井探工作就要开始了。　（本报驻兰州记者）
