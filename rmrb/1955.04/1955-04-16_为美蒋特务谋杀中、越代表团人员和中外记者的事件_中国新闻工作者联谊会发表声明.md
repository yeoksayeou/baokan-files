Xinhua News Agency, April 15th—The All-China Journalists Association issued the following statement regarding the premeditated murder by US-Chiang Kai-shek secret service organs of staff members of the Chinese and Vietnamese delegations attending the Asian-African Conference and Chinese and foreign journalists covering the conference:

    The All-China Journalists Association announces with boundless grief that Chinese journalists and journalists from Poland and Austria, who were traveling to cover the Asian-African Conference on the Air India International “Kashmir Princess” aircraft, have all died as a result of a premeditated sabotage by US and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, causing the plane to explode and crash into the sea. They are: Xinhua News Agency reporters Shen Jiantu and Huang Zuomei, Beijing Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter and Deputy Secretary-General of the All-China Journalists Association Du Hong, Xinhua News Agency reporter and Guangming Daily reporter Li Ping, Beijing Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio photographer Hao Fengge, Polish "People's Tribune" reporter Starewicz, and Austrian "Austrian People's Voice" reporter Jan Fried. The All-China Journalists Association, on behalf of the Chinese journalistic community, extends its deepest condolences and heartfelt sympathy to the families of the deceased.
    Our martyred colleagues were traveling to Bandung via Hong Kong to cover the Asian-African Conference. The Asian-African Conference is a meeting for Asian and African countries to jointly discuss promoting friendly cooperation between countries and safeguarding the national rights of the peoples of all countries and peace in the Asian and African regions. This conference has been warmly supported by peace-loving people around the world and has received widespread support from journalists around the world. However, the US imperialists, who are trying to enslave the people of Asia and Africa and use them as cannon fodder for war, extremely hate and actively conspire to undermine this conference. For a long time, the US imperialists have been instructing Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents to prepare to assassinate the personnel of the People's Republic of China delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai. This premeditated sabotage of the aircraft carrying members of the Chinese and Vietnamese delegations and Chinese and foreign journalists is part of the entire conspiracy of the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents. This "Kashmir Princess" plane explosion and crash is by no means an ordinary plane accident, but a serious international political conspiracy aimed at disrupting the Asian-African Conference.
    The All-China Journalists Association strongly protests the crimes of the US aggressive bloc and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in undermining the Asian-African Conference. We strongly protest the despicable acts of the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents in this premeditated murder of members of the Chinese delegation and the Vietnamese delegation, as well as Chinese and foreign journalists. We call on all media circles, journalist colleagues, and all peace-loving and righteous people around the world to protest and stop the evil conspiracies of the US aggressive bloc and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.
    Prior to this assassination, the Chinese government had learned that US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents were preparing to sabotage the aircraft carrying members of the Chinese delegation and had warned the British Chargé d'Affaires in Beijing about this, requesting the British authorities in Hong Kong to take effective measures to prevent sabotage. However, the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents still succeeded in their sabotage conspiracy. The All-China Journalists Association firmly believes that the British authorities in Hong Kong bear serious responsibility for this incident. The British authorities in Hong Kong must take effective measures to conduct a thorough investigation and ensure that the secret agents involved in this assassination are identified, arrested, and brought to justice. The All-China Journalists Association calls on world public opinion to support our legitimate and urgent demand.
    This murder incident fully demonstrates the serious extent to which Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, with the help of the United States, are creating international political conspiracies. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, entrenched in Taiwan, Chinese territory, is creating war provocations and threatening peace in Asia and the world. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit ships are looting everywhere on the high seas, and their secret service organizations are extending to Hong Kong and even Indonesia, setting up dark nets everywhere and killing people. All this proves that the utterly evil Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which has lost its humanity, must be completely eliminated, and Taiwan, Chinese territory, must be completely liberated. Chinese journalists vow to fight alongside the Chinese people for the liberation of our country's territory, Taiwan.
    Our beloved colleagues who died in this international political conspiracy event have bid farewell to us forever, but the just cause to which they dedicated their lives can never be broken by any enemy's conspiracy or sabotage. All Chinese journalists must inherit the legacy of the martyrs, constantly expose and combat the war conspiracies of the imperialists, and resolutely fight for the complete victory of the cause of peace and justice. The All-China Journalists Association calls on journalists from all countries to be vigilant and expose all conspiracies of the US imperialists to undermine the Asian-African Conference. Chinese journalists will further strengthen unity and cooperation with journalists from Asian and African countries and all honest journalists around the world to fight against the conspiracies of the US imperialists to sabotage and obstruct the Asian-African Conference. Chinese journalists will work together with Asian and African and world journalists to fight for the maintenance of peace in Asia and the world.

    为美蒋特务谋杀中、越代表团人员和中外记者的事件
    中国新闻工作者联谊会发表声明
    新华社十五日讯　中国新闻工作者联谊会为美蒋特务机关预谋杀害出席亚非会议的中国、越南代表团工作人员及采访会议的中外新闻记者一事发表声明如下：
    中国新闻工作者联谊会以无限悲愤的心情宣告：为采访亚非会议而乘坐印度国际航空公司的
  “克什米尔公主号”飞机的中国新闻记者和波兰、奥地利的新闻记者，已因美国和蒋介石的特务分子的预谋破坏致使座机爆炸坠海，全部殉难。他们是：新华社记者沈建图、黄作梅，北京中央人民广播电台记者、中国新闻工作者联谊会副秘书长杜宏，新华社记者兼光明日报记者李平，北京中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄影师郝凤格，波兰“人民论坛报”记者斯塔列茨，奥地利“奥地利人民之声报”记者严斐德。中国新闻工作者联谊会代表中国新闻界向遇害者家属致以沉痛的吊唁和深切的慰问。
    我们的这些殉难的同事们，是为采访亚非会议而经香港前往万隆的。亚非会议是亚洲非洲各国共同商讨促进各国间的友好合作，维护各国人民的民族权利和亚洲非洲地区的和平的会议。这个会议得到了世界和平人民的热烈拥护，也得到全世界新闻工作者的广泛的支持。但是，力图奴役亚洲和非洲人民并把他们当作战争炮灰的美帝国主义分子，却极端仇视并积极阴谋破坏这个会议。许久以来，美帝国主义者指使蒋介石特务准备暗害以周恩来总理为首的中华人民共和国代表团人员。这次预谋破坏中国代表团和越南代表团人员以及中外记者座机，就是美蒋特务分子的整个阴谋计划的一部分。这次
  “克什米尔公主号”飞机爆炸坠海事件，绝不是普通的飞机失事事件，而是严重的国际政治阴谋，其目的是破坏亚非会议。
    中国新闻工作者联谊会强烈抗议美国侵略集团和蒋介石卖国集团破坏亚非会议的罪行。我们强烈抗议美蒋特务分子这次预谋杀害中国代表团人员和越南代表团人员以及中外记者的卑鄙勾当。我们呼吁全世界舆论界、新闻界同仁以及一切爱好和平的正义人士，抗议和制止美国侵略集团和蒋介石卖国集团的罪恶阴谋。
    在这次暗害事件之前，中国政府已获悉美蒋特务分子准备破坏中国代表团人员座机，并曾就此向英国驻北京代办处提出了警告，要求香港英国当局采取有效措施，以防止破坏事件发生。但是，美蒋特务分子仍然得逞其破坏阴谋。中国新闻工作者联谊会坚决认为香港英国当局对此次事件负有严重的责任。香港英国当局必须采取有效措施，进行彻底的调查，务必将参与这一暗害事件的特务分子查明逮捕，加以法办。中国新闻工作者联谊会呼吁全世界舆论支持我们这个正当的急迫的要求。
    这一谋杀事件充分表明蒋介石匪徒在美国帮助下制造国际政治阴谋事件已达到怎样严重的程度。蒋介石匪帮盘据中国领土台湾，制造战争挑衅，威胁着亚洲及世界和平。蒋介石匪帮的船舰在公海上到处劫掠，他们的特务组织伸展到香港以至印度尼西亚，到处布置黑暗网罗，杀害人命。这一切证明已丧失了人性的万恶的蒋介石匪帮必须彻底消灭，中国领土台湾必须完全解放。中国新闻工作者誓与中国人民一道，为解放我们祖国的领土台湾而奋斗。
    在这次国际政治阴谋事件中殉难的我们的敬爱的同事和我们永别了，但是他们一生献身的正义事业绝不是敌人的任何阴谋破坏所能攻破的。中国全体新闻工作者一定继承先烈们的遗志，不断揭露和打击帝国主义者的战争阴谋，为和平正义事业的完全胜利而坚决斗争。中国新闻工作者联谊会呼吁所有国家的新闻工作者一致警惕和揭发美帝国主义分子一切破坏亚非会议的阴谋。中国新闻工作者将要更为加强和亚非国家以及全世界正直的新闻工作者的团结和合作，为反对美帝国主义者破坏和阻挠亚非会议的阴谋而斗争。中国新闻工作者将和亚非国家及世界新闻工作者共同努力，为维护亚洲和世界和平而斗争。
