    The Emerging Industrial Zone of People's Poland
    ——The Development of Industry in the Central and Eastern Regions of Poland
  　Wen Qing
    In 1955, the final year of the Six-Year Plan for building the foundations of socialism, the industrial distribution of People's Poland has undergone significant changes. Many new industrial zones have emerged in the central and eastern provinces of Poland. Consequently, the excessive disparity in the proportion of industrial production between western Poland and the central and eastern regions has been considerably altered, and the industry in various regions has achieved a more balanced development.

    Before the war, Poland's limited heavy industry was mostly concentrated in the southwest and western regions. Upper and Lower Silesia (i.e., Stalinogród Province and Wrocław Province) were known as the "Eastern Ruhr." At that time, the number of workers in Silesia and Łódź and other four provinces accounted for a little less than 69 percent of the total 2.7 million workers in Poland, while the other thirteen provinces accounted for just over 31 percent. The central and eastern provinces were industrially backward, resulting in low living standards for the people there. For example, in Silesia, per capita annual coal consumption was twelve times higher than in the central and eastern regions, and sugar consumption was three times higher. Residents in the western region also consumed far more fabrics and other daily necessities than those in the eastern regions. Due to its developed industry, the western region had many cities and a high population density. Before the war, Poland had an average of 79 people per square kilometer, but Silesia averaged 301 people. The population density in the central and eastern provinces was below the average, with the lowest being Białystok Province at only 46 people per square kilometer.

    People from economically backward areas, unable to make a living, flocked to industrial areas in large numbers, forming the main part of what Polish and foreign capitalists called "redundant people." The so-called "redundant people" were those unemployed and semi-employed under the rule of capitalists and landlords, numbering as many as eight million. Driven by unemployment, these "redundant" Poles migrated abroad in large numbers to seek a livelihood. From 1929 to 1936, more than 1.9 million Poles emigrated to South America and Western Europe.

    The main reason for the industrial backwardness of the central and eastern regions of Poland before the war was the anti-Soviet and anti-communist policies of the reactionary government at the time. Because the further east one went, the closer one got to socialist Soviet Union, the easier it was for workers there to accept revolutionary influence. Therefore, the reactionary rulers were unwilling to establish industries in the central and eastern regions. At the same time, the strong feudal landlord forces and the relative lack of natural resources in these regions were also factors contributing to industrial backwardness.

    To establish a large number of new industrial zones in industrially backward regions based on regional resources and economic conditions, to change the imbalance in the regional distribution of industry, to strengthen the ranks of the working class in these regions, thereby driving the overall development of the national economy in backward regions and improving people's living standards, this is one of the major tasks of People's Poland's Six-Year Plan, and also an important guiding principle of socialist construction. Those who have traveled in Poland have a common impression: the entire Poland is like a huge socialist construction site. This is especially evident and striking in the regions east of the Vistula River. Now, many newly built factories have been partially or fully put into production. Several blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and mechanical, electrical, and coking plants of the Lenin United Steel Plant in Kraków Province have been put into operation. The completion of the plant will fundamentally change the distribution of Poland's steel industry, as its annual steel production will be equivalent to the total annual steel production of Poland before the war. This means that Kraków Province will soon rival Stalinogród Province in steel production. (In the first half of 1954, Stalinogród Province still accounted for 85 percent of Poland's total steel production). Along with the construction of the Lenin United Steel Plant, Nowa Huta, a socialist city with a population of 100,000 built entirely from the ground up, has also been basically completed. In the past six years, Kraków Province has built and is building a total of fifty important factories and mines. The chemical joint enterprises in the Dwory and Auschwitz districts, the powerful power station in Jaworzno, the newly built and expanded huge Kościuszko and Bierut coal mines, the lead-zinc mines in Olkusz and Szachno, as well as the power plant, graphite plant, and fiber plant in the Adriyev district, constitute more than a dozen industrial centers. The spider-like railways and highways connect these industrial zones, making today's Kraków Province the second largest industrial center in Poland after Silesia. The number of industrial workers in the province has surged to over 170,000.

    Lublin Province was originally one of Poland's economically backward provinces. The 30 large and medium-sized factories planned to be built in the province during the Six-Year Plan have been completed and put into production, which has greatly changed the province's economic landscape, turning this formerly purely agricultural province into an industrial-agricultural province. Poland's largest heavy-duty truck factory is located in Lublin. The trucks produced by the factory have not only been running throughout Poland for a long time, but have also been exported overseas. The Krasnik district's ball bearing factory and the Podunajev district's steel bar factory, cement factory and other ten large factories have been put into operation. In the past six years, more than 17,000 houses with water and electrical equipment have been built in the province, and the province's industrial population has exceeded three times that of pre-war days. The newly built 80-kilometer-long double-track railway and hundreds of kilometers of highways have connected Lublin Province with the western and eastern provinces, which will play an important role in the province's future economic development.

    Rzeszów Province is located in the southeastern corner of Poland and was formerly one of the industrially backward areas. Although two aviation industrial enterprises were established here before the war, and it was then touted that Rzeszów Province was "Poland's second largest industrial zone after Silesia," the province only had more than 8,000 workers, less than one three-hundredth of the total number of workers in Poland at that time! Now Rzeszów is truly a thriving industrial zone. Poland's largest oil extraction and refining industry is located in the Carpathian foothills of Rzeszów, which is an oil industrial center that Poland had almost never had before the war. The machinery manufacturing plant in the Jasło district, the metal products plant in the Nisko and Saren districts, and the chemical factories are all newly built modern large factories in People's Poland. Most of the 24 industrial enterprises planned to be built in Rzeszów Province during the Six-Year Plan have been completed. The number of workers in the province has reached more than 100,000, and the total industrial output has exceeded three times that of pre-war days.

    Before the war, Białystok Province was one of the most industrially backward provinces in Poland. When Poland was liberated in 1945, the province had only more than 2,000 workers. However, due to the construction of 35 large and medium-sized industrial enterprises (some of which have been completed), the province has formed three industrial centers. The provincial capital, Białystok, and the Wastok district are the province's heavy industrial centers, the Zambrow district is the textile industrial center, and the Ełk and Gródeck district is the forest and timber industrial center. According to the plan, the number of workers in Białystok Province will increase to 40,000 this year, and the total industrial output will exceed five and a half times that of pre-war days.

    Warsaw is the capital of People's Poland and must be built into a large industrial center with a large number of workers. Today's Warsaw is indeed worthy of this title. In Warsaw, in addition to the original Wola and Praga industrial districts, several new large industrial districts such as Żerań, Służewiec and Rakowiec have been built. These industrial zones are concentrated with many modern large factories such as light automobile manufacturing plants, lathe manufacturing plants, electrical equipment plants, locomotive plants, and tractor manufacturing plants. The industrial population of Warsaw accounts for more than 52 percent of the city's population, and the industrial output has exceeded four times that of pre-war days. Surrounding Warsaw is a fertile and abundant agricultural zone with many agricultural machines, which guarantees the supply of vegetables, milk, and meat to the capital. Closely connected to Warsaw is several industrial zones that have emerged in Warsaw Province in recent years. Warsaw Province, located in the east-central part of Poland, was formerly one of the industrially backward regions, but now it has built industrial zones such as Pruszków, Mazowsze and Ostrów. Among them are agricultural machinery manufacturing plants, high-quality steel smelting plants, large power plants, lathe manufacturing plants, rayon factories, and many light industrial factories such as optical equipment, medical equipment, and food factories.

    Hundreds of socialist industrial enterprises rising in the central and eastern regions of People's Poland constitute many emerging industrial zones. The speed of its development is so fast that even the latest published Polish maps are not satisfactory, because travelers cannot find every emerging industrial town on these maps. In Polish history, the excessive disparity in economic development between "Poland A" (i.e., advanced industrial zone) and "Poland B" (i.e., industrially backward region) has been basically eliminated for the first time. The ranks of the working class in the central and eastern regions have been greatly strengthened, and the foundation of the people's power in these regions has become even stronger. People traveling in the regions east of the Vistula River can also see towering chimney clusters, crisscrossing high-voltage transmission networks, towering iron towers, and mine cranes leisurely moving on high-altitude cables. Tractors and radio receivers are no longer strangers in the fields and villages of central and eastern Poland. There are no more "redundant" Poles in Poland, and people will no longer migrate to Latin America and other places. On the contrary, many Polish overseas Chinese who were forced to wander abroad by unemployment before the war have returned to the motherland in large numbers. In the four years from 1945 to 1948 alone, more than 1.8 million Polish overseas Chinese returned to the country.

    人民波兰新兴的工业区
    ——波兰中部和东部地区工业的发展
  　文清
    在建设社会主义基础的六年计划的最后一年——一九五五年，人民波兰的工业分布状况已起了重大变化，在波兰的中部和东部各省已出现了许多新兴的工业区。因此，波兰西部和中部、东部地区之间在工业生产比重上的过分悬殊的现象已有了相当的变化，各地区的工业已有比较平衡的发展了。
    战前波兰仅有的一些重工业大都集中在西南部和西部地区，上、下西里西亚（即斯大林格罗德省和伏罗兹拉夫省）曾有“东方鲁尔”之称。那时，西里西亚和罗兹等四个省的工人数目就占全波两百七十万工人的百分之六十九弱，而其它十三个省却只占百分之三十一强。中部和东部各省因工业落后，那里人民的生活水平就很低。比如当时在西里西亚，居民每人每年煤的消费量比中部和东部地区多十二倍，糖的消费量多三倍；西部居民的衣料和其它日用品消费量也远较东部地区为高。西部地区因工业发达，城市就很多，人口密度就大。战前波兰全国平均每平方公里有七十九人，但西里西亚却平均达到三百零一人，中部和东部各省的人口密度都在平均数字以下，最低的如白洛斯多克省每平方公里只有四十六人。
    经济落后地区生活无着的人，大批地流入工业地区，构成了战前被波兰和外国的资本家称为“多余的人”的主要部分。所谓“多余的人”就是在当时资本家和地主统治下失业和半失业的人，他们为数达八百万之多。这些“多余”的波兰人被失业所迫，就大批流浪到国外去寻找生计。自一九二九至一九三六年间，从波兰流亡到南美洲和西欧去的波兰人竟达一百九十多万。
    战前波兰的中部和东部地区工业落后的主要原因，就是当时反动政府的反苏、反共政策。因越往东就越靠近社会主义的苏联，那里的工人就越容易接受革命的影响。所以反动统治者就不愿在中部和东部地区建立工业。同时，这些地区当时存在的强大封建地主势力和自然资源的比较缺乏的情况，也是形成工业落后的原因之一。
    根据各地区的资源和经济条件在工业落后地区建立大量新的工业地区以改变工业分布在地区上的不平衡状态，壮大这些地区工人阶级的队伍，从而带动落后地区国民经济的全面发展并提高人民生活水平，这是人民波兰六年计划的重大任务之一，也是社会主义建设的重要方针之一。在波兰作过客的人都有一个共同印象：整个波兰就像一个庞大的社会主义建设工地。而这在维斯杜拉河以东地区是特别明显和触目的。现在，许多新建的工厂已局部或全部投入生产。克拉科夫省的列宁联合钢铁厂已有数座高炉、平炉和机械、电力、炼焦等分厂投入生产。该厂全部建成后，将使波兰钢铁工业的分布情况起一根本变化。因为它每年的钢铁产量将相等于战前全波的钢铁年产量。就是说：克拉科夫省在钢铁生产上不久就要同斯大林格罗德省并驾齐驱了。（一九五四年前半年，斯大林格罗德省的钢铁产量仍占波兰全国钢铁总产量的百分之八十五）。随着列宁联合钢铁厂的建设，一个拥有十万人口的、完全从空地上建设起来的社会主义城市诺瓦—胡塔也基本上建成了。克拉科夫省六年来已经建成和正在兴建的重要工厂、矿山共五十个。德沃尔区和奥斯威辛区的化学联合企业、雅沃什诺的强大电力站、新建和扩建的巨大的科斯纠什科和贝鲁特煤矿、奥尔库什和沙赫诺的铅锌矿以及阿德里霍夫区的动力厂、石墨厂、纤维厂等，构成了十几个工业中心，而蛛网似的铁路和公路又把这些工业区联接起来，使得今日的克拉科夫省在波兰已成为除西里西亚外的第二个大工业中心了。全省产业工人已突增至十七万人以上。
    卢布林省原是波兰经济落后的省份之一，六年计划规定在全省建设的三十个大、中型工厂，有的已全部完成并开始生产，这就大大改变了全省的经济面貌，使这个不久前的纯农业省已成为一个工业—农业省了。波兰最大的载重汽车制造厂就在卢布林，该厂出产的卡车不仅早已驰骋波兰全国，并已输出海外。克拉斯尼克区的滚珠轴承厂和波杜涅夫区的钢筋厂，水泥厂等十几个大工厂均已开工生产。六年来在全省共建筑了一万七千多间有水、电设备的住宅，全省工业人口已超过战前三倍。新建的八十公里长的双轨铁路和数百公里公路已把卢布林省同西部和东部各省联接了起来，这对该省今后的经济发展将起重要作用。
    热苏夫省位在波兰的东南角，从前同样是工业落后的地区之一。虽然战前曾在这里建立了两个航空工业企业，且当时曾大吹大擂地说什么热苏夫省已是“除西里西亚外波兰的第二大工业区”了，但那时全省只有八千多工人，还不到当时波兰全国工人总数的三百分之一哩！现在热苏夫却真名符其实地是一个欣欣向荣的工业区了。波兰最大的石油开采、冶炼工业就在热苏夫的喀尔巴阡山麓，这是战前波兰所几乎没有过的石油工业中心。雅斯洛区的机械制造厂、尼斯柯和沙仁区的金属制件厂和化学工厂等都是人民波兰新建的近代化大工厂。六年计划规定在热苏夫省兴建的二十四个工业企业已大部建成，全省工人数目已达十万人以上，工业总产量已超过战前三倍。
    战前全波兰在工业上最落后的一个省要算白洛斯多克省了，一九四五年波兰解放时全省只有两千多工人。但由于三十五个大、中工业企业的建设（有的且已建成），全省已形成三个工业中心。省会白洛斯多克市和伐斯德区是该省的重工业中心，查姆布洛夫区是纺织工业中心，而艾克特和格洛燕沃区是森林和木材工业中心。按计划规定，白洛斯多克省今年的工人数目将增至四万人，工业总产量将超过战前五倍半。
    华沙市既是人民波兰的首都，就必须把它建设成为工人阶级人数众多的巨大的工业中心，而今日的华沙在这一点上也的确是当之无愧了。在华沙市，除原有的沃里和布拉加两个工业区外，已新建起了像泽兰、斯鲁热查和绕布里等好几个大工业区。在这些工业区中集中有轻型汽车制造厂、车床制造厂、电工器材厂、机车厂和拖拉机制造厂等许多近代化的大工厂。华沙市的工业人口占全市人口的百分之五十二强，工业产量已超过战前四倍。在华沙市的周围是一个肥沃、丰盛的拥有许多农业机器的农业地带，它保证对首都的蔬菜、牛奶和肉类的供给。同华沙市紧相接连的是近年来在华沙省兴起的几个工业区。华沙省位于波兰中部偏东，原是工业落后地区之一，但现已建起了普鲁什科夫、玛佐夫舍和奥斯特洛夫等工业区。其中有农业机械制造厂、优质钢冶炼厂、大电力厂、车床制造厂、人造丝工厂和许多光学器材、医学器材、食品工厂等轻工业工厂。
    在人民波兰的中部和东部地区兴起的数以百计的社会主义工业企业，构成了许多新兴的工业区。其发展速度是如此之快，以致任何最新出版的波兰地图都不能令人满意，因为旅行者总不能在这些地图上找到每一个新兴的工业城镇。在波兰历史上，已第一次基本上消灭了“波兰A”（即先进的工业区）和“波兰B”（即工业落后地区）在经济发展上的过分悬殊现象。中部和东部地区的工人阶级的阵容已相当壮大，人民政权在这些地区的基础也就更加坚强。旅行在维斯杜拉河以东地区的人，同样可以不时看到高耸的烟筒群、纵横交织的高压输电网、傲然屹立的铁塔和那些在高空电缆上悠然游动的矿山吊车。拖拉机和无线电收音机在中部和东部的田野和农村中已不再是生客了。在波兰再也没有
  “多余”的波兰人了，人们再也不会向拉丁美洲等地流浪了。相反，许多战前为失业所迫而流浪国外的波兰侨民已大批返回祖国，只在一九四五到一九四八四年中，回国的波兰侨民就有一百八十万人以上。
