Xinhua News Agency, London: According to TASS, the British Co-operative Party Annual Meeting opened in Scarborough on the 8th. Representatives attending the meeting included 647 cooperative organizations with 9,644,701 members.

　　The annual meeting discussed foreign policy issues on the 9th.

　　Dillon, a representative of the Birkenhead Co-operative Party local organization, proposed a motion calling on the British government to immediately hold negotiations with the Soviet Union, the United States, the People's Republic of China, and France to "achieve mutual understanding on various international issues." The motion stated: "Every effort must be made to formulate a pan-European security treaty."

　　Representatives from the London Co-operative Party local organization supported Dillon's motion and emphasized the importance of striving for German reunification.

　　Member of Parliament Hudson sharply criticized the "policy of strength." He said that the British cooperative movement should firmly oppose this policy and strive for a policy of consultation. This opinion was unanimously approved by the audience.

　　A motion put forward by the Glasgow Co-operative Association demanding that the People's Republic of China be immediately granted its legitimate seat in the United Nations was also unanimously adopted. The motion stated that restoring the rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is a "direct step towards easing international tensions."

　　Another motion called for the destruction of atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons, and guided missiles. This motion expressed regret that the British government had not held talks with the heads of the US and Soviet governments to discuss international issues in accordance with the resolution of the House of Commons. Representatives from Co-operative Party local organizations in Coventry, Birkenhead, and many other cities supported this motion.

　　The meeting also unanimously passed a resolution condemning the US military collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. The resolution considered the US-Chiang collusion to be "a provocation and threat to the cause of world peace," and demanded that the Co-operative Party National Committee join the Labour Party in launching a widespread movement to prevent the British government from undertaking obligations to the United States against the People's Republic of China.

　　The meeting also discussed and passed many motions on colonial issues before moving on to discussions on domestic issues.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 12th: London dispatch: The British Independent Labour Party Annual Meeting passed a resolution on the 10th condemning the US naval and air forces' deployment in Chinese waters as a "direct provocation" against the People's Republic of China.

　　The resolution also condemned the decision by the United States, Britain, France, and other countries to rearm West Germany. The resolution argued that Britain should "declare neutrality in the event of a Third World War."

　　The resolution demanded that British armed forces withdraw from Kenya, Cyprus, and Malaya, and advocated for immediate freedom and independence for all colonies under British rule or mandate.

    英国合作党年会谴责美国同蒋贼进行勾结
    英国独立工党年会抗议美国对我国的挑衅
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国合作党年会八日在斯卡巴罗开幕。派代表出席会议的有拥有九百六十四万四千七百零一名社员的六百四十七个合作社组织。
    年会在九日讨论了外交政策问题。
    柏肯黑德市合作党地方组织的代表狄龙提出一项提案，要求英国政府同苏联、美国、中华人民共和国和法国立即举行谈判，以“在各项国际问题上取得互相谅解”。议案说：“必须竭尽一切努力，以制定全欧安全条约。”
    伦敦合作党地方组织的代表拥护狄龙的提案，并且强调指出了争取德国统一的重要性。
    议员哈德逊尖锐地抨击了“实力政策”。他说，英国合作运动应当坚决反对这种政策，而争取协商的政策。他的这一意见获得了全场一致的赞同。
    格拉斯哥合作社公会代表提出的一项要求立刻给予中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位的提案也获得一致通过。这个提案说，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的权利是“使国际紧张局势趋向缓和的直接步骤”。
    还有一项提案要求销毁原子武器、细菌武器和定向飞弹。这项提案对英国政府没有按照下院的决议同美国及苏联政府首脑举行会谈以讨论国际问题表示遗憾。考文垂、柏肯黑德和其他许多城市的合作党地方组织的代表都支持这项提案。
    会议并一致通过了一项谴责美国同蒋介石集团进行军事勾结的决议。这一决议认为美蒋勾结是“对全世界和平事业的挑衅和威胁”，要求合作党全国委员会联合工党展开广泛运动，以阻止英国政府向美国承担反对中华人民共和国的义务。
    会议还讨论和通过了关于殖民地问题的许多议案，然后转入国内问题的讨论。
    新华社十二日讯　伦敦消息：英国独立工党年会在十日通过决议，谴责美国海、空军陈兵中国海面是对中华人民共和国的“直接的挑衅”。
    决议还谴责美、英、法等国关于重新武装西德的决定。决议主张英国应该“宣布在发生第三次世界大战的情况下保持中立”。
    决议要求英国武装部队退出怯尼亚、塞浦路斯和马来亚，并且主张立即给在英国统治或者是委任统治下的所有殖民地以自由和独立。
