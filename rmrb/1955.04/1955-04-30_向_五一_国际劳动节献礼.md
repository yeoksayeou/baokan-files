    Production Triumphs of Workers in Liaoning Province

    On the eve of "May 1st," production triumphs continue to be reported from factories and mines in Liaoning Province. Workers in the wire rod rolling section of the Shenyang Wire Rod Factory have completed the rolling task of the new product flat steel four days ahead of schedule. They improved the rolling process, increasing the daily output by 60% and achieving a 100% finished product rate. Coal mining workers at the Fushun Open-pit Mine realized the slogan of "tight at the beginning of the month, stable in the middle of the month, and even at the end of the month," increasing the production of raw coal by more than 10,000 tons over the plan in the first ten days of April. On April 13th, the first-grade flat glass produced by the melting workshop of the Shenyang No. 1 Glass Factory reached 88.61%, creating the highest record for the quality of flat glass in this factory for many years. By learning the advanced experience of the "non-oxidizing reduction method," the steelmaking workers and technicians of the electric furnace engineering section of the Shenyang Cement Machinery Repair Plant can save 100 kilograms of ferromanganese for every ton of high manganese steel produced, and the smelting time for each furnace of steel is also shortened by 40 minutes.

    Workers in various factories and mines are striving to complete their plans for April or the second quarter ahead of schedule. (Xinhua News Agency)

    An Automatic Four-Sided Planing Machine is Born

    Huang Rongchang, a representative of the National People's Congress and a special-class industrial labor model in Chongqing, and the workers in his group recently jointly created an automatic four-sided planing machine as a gift to welcome "May 1st" International Labor Day. This machine has been successfully test-run on April 24th, and its production efficiency is dozens of times higher than manual planing.

    After the woodworking workshop of the Southwest Steel Company, where Huang Rongchang works, achieved full mechanization last year, Huang Rongchang and the workers in his group successively created several machines such as automatic material transportation machines, automatic double-band saws, and automatic double-carriage circular saws, greatly increasing the capacity for sawing and cutting materials. However, in the processing of the planing process, they still had to go through three or four procedures to make the finished product. Because other workshops required an increasing quantity of processed wood products, the workers in the group sometimes had to use manual planing, and the planing process became a key obstacle to production. Now, this machine they created can process wood boards into various finished products in just one pass. (Xinhua News Agency)

    An Automatic Sweeping and Vacuuming Vehicle

    On the 27th, an automatic sweeping and vacuuming vehicle appeared on the streets of Shenyang. This vehicle uses more than a dozen specially made long brooms and vacuum cleaners to automatically sweep dirt from the road surface, more than five meters wide, into the vehicle box. It can sweep 60,000 square meters of road surface per hour.

    This vehicle was jointly researched and developed by Cui Tiexin, a car driver at the Shenyang Municipal Sanitation Bureau's Cleaning Business Management Office, and some workers from the car team, using an old truck over a period of more than half a year. They presented this vehicle as a gift for the "May 1st" holiday. (Xinhua News Agency)
