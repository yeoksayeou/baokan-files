The first 6,000-kilowatt turbine, trial-produced by the state-owned Shanghai Turbine Factory, completed its final assembly on March 30th.

This turbine is the most complex and precision-demanding part of a complete 6,000-kilowatt turbo-generator set, which is a collaborative trial product of several state-owned factories including Shanghai Electrical Machinery Factory, Shanghai Turbine Factory, and Shanghai Boiler Factory. It has more than 14,000 parts. Among them, there are more than 2,200 turbine "blades" which require extremely high precision. In order to complete this task, the Shanghai Turbine Factory, under the enthusiastic guidance of Czechoslovak experts, held tolerance and blueprint learning classes, various short-term technical lectures and seminars. The processing of some important single parts, and pre-processing internships using dummy workpieces. This played a big role in the trial production of the turbine. During the trial production process, the workers strictly implemented the Czechoslovak blueprint requirements, conscientiously observed the process regulations, inspected each process, and strictly appraised each part and component.

After completing the critical work of the overall assembly – the heat shrinking process – on March 12th, this turbine completed all the final assembly work on the afternoon of the 30th.

    第一台六千瓩汽轮机装好了
    国营上海汽轮机厂试制的我国第一台六千瓩汽轮机，到三月三十日已完成总装配工作。
    这部汽轮机是上海电机厂、上海汽轮机厂、上海锅炉厂等几个国营工厂协作试制的整套六千瓩汽轮发电机设备中最复杂、精密度要求最高的一部分。它的全部零件有一万四千多件。其中精密度要求极严的汽轮机“叶片”就有二千二百多片。上海汽轮机厂为完成这项工作，在捷克斯洛伐克专家们热情的指导下，先后举办了公差和图纸学习班、各种短期技术讲座和座谈会。有些重要单件的加工，并在事先利用假工作物进行加工实习。这对汽轮机的试制曾起了很大作用。在试制过程中，职工们严格执行了捷克斯洛伐克的图纸要求，认真遵守工艺规程，对每一道工序都进行了检验，对每一个零件和部件，都进行了严格的鉴定。
    这部汽轮机在三月十二日完成总装配工作中带关键性的工作——红套工作以后，在三十日下午就完成全部总装配工作。
