Recollections of Lenin

The Kirov Factory in Leningrad (formerly the Putilov Factory), a recipient of four orders of merit, boasts a glorious revolutionary tradition. The Communist Party's heroic history records the Putilov Factory workers' contributions to the revolutionary cause. During the turbulent days of 1917, the Putilov Factory workers were among the shock troops of revolutionary Russia. They were fortunate enough to see the great Lenin, hear his voice, and execute his combat instructions. Many who participated in those exciting events are still working in this factory today. They have all heard Lenin's words and spoken with Lenin. The following are recollections of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin by several workers.

Ilyich Among the Workers of the Putilov Factory

A.K. Miroshnikov, Head of the Printing Workshop at the Kirov Factory

As far as I remember, Lenin came to our factory twice.

I remember that during the tense days of May 1917, Lenin came to us. We didn't all understand the policies of the Provisional Government at that time; that government was comprised of "socialists" – Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. On May 12th, a meeting was held in the factory. Thousands of people gathered in the courtyard. The Menshevik Chkheidze and the Socialist-Revolutionary Chernov attended the meeting. The workers were unwilling to listen to what they had to say, and practically didn't let Chernov finish speaking. The "distinguished guests" left, their fine speeches failing to move anyone.

At this moment, news quickly spread from the gate: Lenin is here! We saw the workers carrying Ilyich in from the gate. A storm of noisy welcomes erupted around him. Ilyich went up to the podium; his voice wasn't loud, but the surroundings were so quiet, it was as if a bell had been rung. He began by talking about Chkheidze and Chernov, saying, "Although I didn't hear what they said today, I know…" Then Ilyich thoroughly shattered the words of the "Provisional Government" supporters. In simple and clear language, he explained the Bolsheviks' views on war and peace to the workers. The war must end – this is what everyone at the meeting understood from his words.

Lenin spoke for more than an hour. As soon as he finished speaking, those standing close to him picked him up again, and everyone sang "The Internationale," carrying him all the way to the car. Ilyich left, but the workshops discussed him for a long time. From that day on, a transformation occurred in the factory. The Bolsheviks completely gained the upper hand.

The second time I saw Lenin was already in 1918. It was a very difficult time. The factory was almost out of fuel. The factory faced the threat of closure. In the autumn, V.I. Lenin came to us. He gathered together the members of the factory committee and the chairmen of the workshop committees. Lenin said that such an important factory could not be allowed to shut down. He said that the workers should take the most forceful measures, visit other factories to see if there was any excess fuel, and look at the city's canals, especially the ring canal. There was a lot of timber there: rafts, old barges, and planks. These things should be collected. He said that the sailors of the Baltic Fleet would help us. At the same time, as soon as the roads were open, trains should be sent to the timber-producing areas immediately. Ilyich said: "The revolution needs the Putilov Factory to continue working. We urgently need its products."

His words inspired us, and we took action. Twelve train carriages were converted into the style of freight trams, and these cars were used to transport firewood and planks from the ring canal, as well as to transport coal and oil. Our boiler room became active, and we obtained permission to collect fuel on all the canals in the city. As soon as it became possible, we sent a train of forty tank cars to Baku to transport fuel.

Like all Soviet people, I am proud of the great achievements of our motherland. We are all advancing by leaps and bounds along the path indicated by Lenin. Long before the Great Patriotic War, our country had established a strong fuel and power base. Now, if you tell young people how we struggled with a lack of fuel at that time, it may be difficult to believe: how could such a large factory be like that? Now, wherever you look, there are power stations everywhere, and how many new power stations are under construction! And this is precisely from the implementation of Lenin's plan for the electrification of Russia. This makes you can't help but admire again and again: how far Ilyich saw.

The Tasks Lenin Entrusted to Us

V.I. Sobolev, Head of the Cadre Education Section at the Kirov Factory

I remember that less than a week after the victory of the October Revolution, we were summoned to Smolny. It was said that we would go to various parts of Russia to conduct propaganda according to Lenin's instructions. Everyone gathered in the hall. The door opened, and Lenin walked in, heading straight for us Putilov Factory workers. We surrounded him tightly. It was the first time I was so close to him; I simply didn't expect him to be so approachable and so simple.

The workers of the Putilov Factory had a long, heartfelt conversation with Lenin. Ilyich's conversation made anyone feel at ease. How clear his words were. He told us about the first decrees of the Soviet regime (everyone here received the full text of the Decree on Peace and the Decree on Land), and about how to explain these decrees to the people and how to explain the essence of the Soviet regime.

It should be explained that most of us were carrying out such complex tasks for the first time.

Ilyich told us in detail how to act. He said that we should rely on the poor peasants, and with the support of the poor peasants, we could forever strike at the enemies of the revolution. Lenin also told us how we ourselves should act. He said: "Don't live in the homes of the rich and wealthy. Before convening meetings, talk to the poor peasants and get their support in advance."

Inspired by Lenin, we dispersed to various parts of the country, some to Fergana, some to Siberia, and some to the Caucasus. I was carrying out the tasks Lenin gave me in the rural areas of Tver Province.

Lenin's envoys returned with joy, bringing to Smolny the records of the peasant congresses expressing support for the young Soviet regime.

When looking back on the past, what is particularly exciting is the first document that Lenin gave to the people - the Decree on Peace. Now, when you see the new victory of the powerful peace movement, you will think: "This is by no means accidental. This is the fire of the struggle for peace that has been burning from Lenin's spark, and it shines with the light of hope on the fate of ordinary people on earth."

Meeting Lenin from the Front

I.K. Korolev, Former Machine Tool Adjuster in the Central Tool Workshop of the Kirov Factory

In the spring of 1917, our division stationed near Old Konstantinov held an oath to the Provisional Government. The officers talked again about the war being "carried out to victory." At that time, there were very few Bolsheviks here. The right-wing Socialist-Revolutionaries dominated more people. Few people knew where they wanted to drag us. Then, comrades said to me: "Ivan, you are from Petrograd, you are familiar with the streets and alleys there, go and find Lenin, ask him what we should do, and bring his opinion back. In this way, I appeared in Petrograd as a representative of the regiment. This was in early April 1917. I came to the Kshessinskaya Palace, where the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party was located at that time. At first, the guards would not let me, a non-party member, in, but I explained that I was sent by the front-line soldiers to meet Lenin. I went in, and there I happened to meet Vladimir Ilyich walking towards the meeting room. I approached Ilyich and greeted him.

"Comrade, where are you from?" he asked.

"From the Ukrainian front," I said.

Vladimir immediately became interested: how are things there, what are the soldiers thinking? I explained to him as much as possible, explaining why they sent me. I said that I came to seek opinions and listen to the party's views. Suggesting how we should act. It is best to send a few firm Bolsheviks to our regiment.

Vladimir Ilyich said with a smile:

"Comrade, we don't have enough people here either. And in your place, there are obviously people who stand on the side of the people. We will give you some books and explain everything to you. The principle is very simple."

Ilyich spent twenty minutes talking to me, although he had a lot of things to do that day.

He was so concerned about an unfamiliar ordinary person, and he asked about the soldiers' lives with such kindness, which gave me a deep impression.

At the end of the conversation, he suddenly asked:

"Comrade, have you joined the party?"

"No," I replied.

"What's the matter, are you unwilling?"

"What are you saying," I said, "just because I haven't gone through the procedures yet."

"Then," Lenin said to me, "if there is such a wish, go upstairs," he pointed to a room and said, "someone will talk to you there."

Then he said goodbye to me and went to the comrades who were waiting for him.

Upstairs, several responsible staff members of the Party Central Committee talked to me. A day later, I received a party membership card - a precious pink card - in the military department of the Central Committee.

I returned to my comrades in the regiment with a large number of party documents and Bolshevik newspapers, with a party card in my pocket. The Bolshevik Party organization here began to gather strength. In this way, the rampant situation of the Socialist-Revolutionaries quickly became a thing of the past.

This was not my only meeting with Lenin. I often saw him at the Petrograd Soviet meetings because I was a Soviet representative. In addition, I also saw him at mass rallies. Vladimir Ilyich's extraordinary simplicity, his skill in talking to people, could not be forgotten at all times; his persuasiveness, his iron-like will that helped him fight against the enemy in the most complex periods, was constantly amazing.

### 回忆列宁

    回忆列宁
    荣膺四次勋章的苏联列宁格勒基洛夫工厂（过去的普梯洛夫工厂），是富有光荣的革命传统的。共产党的英勇的历史记载着普梯洛夫工厂工人对革命事业的贡献。在一九一七年的沸腾的日子里，普梯洛夫工厂工人是革命的俄罗斯人民的突击队伍之一。他们幸运地看到了伟大的列宁，听到了他的声音，执行过他的战斗指令。当时参加过那激动人心的事件的许多人，现在还在这个工厂里工作着。他们都听到过列宁的话、同列宁谈过话。下面是几位工人关于弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁的回忆。
    伊里奇在普梯洛夫工厂工人中间
    基洛夫工厂印刷车间主任　阿·卡·米罗什尼科夫
    据我所记得的，列宁到我们工厂来过两次。
    记得在一九一七年五月的紧张日子里，列宁到我们这儿来了。我们大家还不是都了解临时政府的政策，那时临时政府里是一些这样的“社会主义者”——社会革命党人和孟什维克。五月十二日在工厂里开了一次大会。几千人都聚集在院子里。孟什维克齐赫芝和社会革命党人切尔诺夫来参加了大会。工人们不愿意听他们所说的话，简直就没有让切尔诺夫说完。“高贵的客人”走了，他们那漂亮的演词没有能打动任何人。
    这时，从大门口飞快地传来了一个消息：列宁来了！我们一看，工人们从门口把伊里奇抬进来了。四周是暴风雨般的喧闹的欢迎声。伊里奇走上讲台，他说话的声音不大，可是四周安静极了，简直像有人敲过了钟一样。开始时，他谈到了齐赫芝和切尔诺夫，他说：“我今天虽然没有听到他们讲的是什么，可是我知道……”于是伊里奇就彻底粉碎了“临时政府”拥护者们所说的话。他用简单明了的话向工人们说明了布尔什维克对战争和和平的看法。必须结束战争——这就是全体参加大会的人从他的话中所懂得的道理。
    列宁讲了一个多小时的话。他一讲完，那些站得离他近的人就又把他抬起来了，大家高唱着“国际歌”，把他一直抬到汽车上去。伊里奇走了，可是各车间都长久地谈论着他。从那一天起，工厂里就发生了转变。布尔什维克完全占了上风。
    我第二次看到列宁已经是一九一八年了。那是很艰难的时候。工厂里的燃料都快烧完了。工厂面临停工的威胁。秋天，弗·伊·列宁到我们这儿来了。他召集起工厂委员会的委员、车间委员会的主席。列宁说，不能让这样一个重要的工厂停工。他说，工人们应该采取最有力的措施，到别的工厂看看，看一下那儿有没有多余的燃料，看一下城里的运河，特别是环形运河。那儿有不少木材：木筏、旧驳船、木板。应该把这些东西收集起来。他说，波罗的海舰队的水兵会帮助我们。同时，只要路一通，就应该立刻派火车到产木材的地区去。伊里奇说：“革命需要普梯洛夫工厂照常工作。我们非常需要它的产品。”
    他的话鼓舞了我们，我们行动起来了。十二节火车车厢改装成载重电车的样式，用这些车从环形运河运来了木柴、木板，并用它们运送煤和石油。我们的锅炉房活跃起来了，我们得到在全市所有的运河上收集燃料的许可。等到刚刚有了可能时，我们就从四十部油槽车中派了一列车到巴库去运燃料。
    同所有的苏维埃人一样，我以我们祖国的伟大成就而自豪。我们大家沿着列宁指示的道路大踏步前进。早在伟大卫国战争以前，我国就已建立了强大的燃料、动力基地。现在你要是向青年们说，我们当时是怎样在缺乏燃料的情况下进行斗争，这也许很难使人相信：那么大的工厂怎么会是这样的。现在，无论看看哪儿，到处都是发电站，而且，还有多少新的发电站正在建设起来啊！而这正是从实现列宁的俄罗斯电气化计划开始的。这就使你不能不一再赞叹：伊里奇看得多么远啊。
    列宁交给我们的任务
    基洛夫工厂干部教育科科长　弗·伊·索包列夫
    我记得，在十月革命胜利后还不到一个星期，我们被召集到斯莫尔尼来。听说是我们将按列宁的指示到俄罗斯各地去作宣传。大家聚集在大厅里。门开了，列宁走了进来，一直走向我们普梯洛夫工厂工人中间。我们紧紧地把他团团围住。我们谈起来了。我是第一次离他这样近，简直没有想到他是这样容易接近，这样质朴。
    普梯洛夫工厂的工人们和列宁做了长时间倾心的谈话。伊里奇的谈话，使任何人都感不到一点拘束。他的话全都是多么简明啊。他对我们讲述苏维埃政权的第一批法令（在这儿每一个人都得到了和平法令和土地法令的全文），讲到应该怎样向人民解说这些法令，怎样解释苏维埃政权的本质。
    应当说明，我们大多数人还是第一次完成这样复杂的任务呢。
    伊里奇详详细细地告诉我们说，应该怎样行动。他说，我们应当依靠贫农，在贫农的支持下才能永远给革命的敌人以打击。列宁也告诉我们，我们自己应当怎样行动。他说：“不要住到那些有钱的人和富裕的人家里。在召开会议以前，要和贫农谈一谈，应当事先得到他们的支持。”
    在列宁的鼓舞下，我们分散到国内各地去，有的人去费尔干，有的人去西伯利亚，有的人去高加索。我是在特维尔省的农村执行列宁所给的任务的。
    列宁的使者怀着愉快的心情回来了，他们把表示支持年轻的苏维埃政权的农民大会的记录带到斯莫尔尼来。
    当回顾过去的时候，特别使人激动的就是列宁给予人民的第一个文件——和平法令。现在当你看到强大的和平运动的新胜利的时候，就会想道：“这绝不是偶然的，这是从列宁的火花中燃烧起来的争取和平斗争的烈火，它用希望的光辉照耀着大地上普通人的命运。”
    从前线去会见列宁
    基洛夫工厂中央工具车间前机床调整手　依·卡·柯洛列夫
    一九一七年春天，我们驻在旧康斯坦丁诺夫附近的师团，举行了对临时政府的宣誓。军官们又谈论着战争要“进行到胜利为止”的话。当时我们这里的布尔什维克还很少。右派社会革命党人支配了更多的人。他们要把我们拖到哪里去，是很少有人知道的。这样，同志们就对我说：“伊万，你是彼得格勒人，那里的大街小巷你都熟习，你去找一趟列宁吧，问一问我们应该怎样办，并且把他的意见带回来。这样，我就作为一个团的代表出现在彼得格勒了。这是一九一七年四月初的事。我来到克谢辛斯卡娅宫，当时布尔什维克党中央委员会设在那里。起初警卫人员不放我这个非党员进去，而我解释说我是由前线战士派来会见列宁的。我进去了，在那里，刚好碰见弗拉基米尔·伊里奇向会议室走去。我走近伊里奇，向他打招呼。
    “同志，您从哪儿来的啊？”他问。
      “从乌克兰前线来的。”我说。
    弗拉基米尔立刻就感到兴趣了：我们那里的事情怎样，士兵们想些什么呢？我尽可能地向他解释，说明他们为什么派我来。我说我来是为了征求意见，为了倾听党的主张。提示我们应当怎样行动。最好是派几个坚定的布尔什维克到我们团里去。
    弗拉基米尔·伊里奇微笑着说道：
      “同志，就是我们这里人手也不多。而在你们那里，显然有跟人民站在一边的人。我们给你们一些书籍，并向你们说明一切。道理是很简单的。”
    伊里奇花了二十分钟的时间和我谈话，虽然那天他的事情很多。
    他这样关怀一个不熟识的普通人，这样亲切地问到士兵的起居，给了我很深的印象。
    在谈话结束时，他突然问道：
    “同志，您入党了吗？”
    “没有，”我回答说。
    “怎么回事，是您不愿意吗？”
    “您这是怎么说的呢，”我说，“只是因为我还不会办手续。”
    “那么，”列宁对我说，“如果真有这种愿望的话，您就上楼去，”他指着一间屋子说，“那里有人跟您谈。”
    于是他同我告别，到那些等候着他的同志们那儿去了。
    在楼上，党中央委员会的几个负责工作人员和我谈了话。过了一天，我在中央委员会的军事部接受了党证——一张珍贵的粉红色卡片。
    我带着大量党的文件和布尔什维克报纸，口袋里装着党证回到了本团的同志们那里。我们这里的布尔什维克党组织开始聚集力量。这样，社会革命党人的猖獗情形，很快就变成了过去。
    这并不是我同列宁的唯一的一次会面。我在彼得格勒苏维埃会议上常看到他，因为我是苏维埃代表。此外，在群众大会上也看到过他。弗拉基米尔·伊里奇的异乎寻常的朴素，他同人们进行谈话的技巧，能使人时刻不忘；他的说服力，他那在最复杂的时期帮助他对敌进行斗争的钢铁般的毅力，是使人惊叹不止的。　（本报特约稿）（附图片）
