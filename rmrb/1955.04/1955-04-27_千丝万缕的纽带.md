    The Countless Ties That Bind
    By Our Correspondent Wang Xi
    Comrade, have you ever experienced the feeling of leaving your hometown and being tossed about by life, yearning for your relatives? Have you ever savored the joy of reading a letter from home, bringing news of peace from thousands of miles away?
    Our compatriots residing in Japan often await news from the motherland with such feelings. Listen to what they have to say to their fellow countrymen! Zhang Jiajue, an elderly overseas Chinese from Fujian, came to Japan at a young age and has lived there for over sixty years. He has worked as a cook, a small businessman, and even made noodles by hand. This old man, who has experienced several wars and tasted the hardships of life abroad, said with a trembling voice and excitement: "I have lived for seventy-two years, and I have never been happier than in these recent years. The motherland has become independent and prosperous, and I have finally lived to see this day. I have finally made it through!" A farmer surnamed Li from Hebei Province remained silent for a long time when I handed him a cigarette brought from the motherland. Then, speaking with a heavy northern accent, he said: "Smoking this cigarette, I can't describe what I'm feeling..." "Comrade, you may not have suffered like this... When I was fifteen years old, there was a disaster in my hometown, and we couldn't even afford to eat chaff and wild vegetables. My mother asked a friend to bring me to Japan to find a living. Alas! More than twenty years abroad, it's like being a child without a mother, never having a day of ease." He seemed very sorry for bringing up his past pain in front of everyone and quickly changed the subject: "Think about how strong our motherland is now, and my family back home is living a good life. My hardship for most of my life has not been in vain. A child without a mother has finally found a home."
    At a reception in Osaka, an old lady from Beijing came up to me with her young daughter to say hello. She said, "Hearing the dialect of my hometown here..." She choked up before she could finish the sentence. She warmly held my hand, looking me up and down as if she were carefully examining her long-lost child. "Sir, representatives of our new China have arrived. We feel so honored! Let me take a good look at you... I have been listening to the radio every day these past few days, listening to the speeches of Delegation Leader Lei Renmin. I saw the films you brought in Kobe once, and I'm going to see them again tonight..."
    On the afternoon of the 19th, it was raining. We will never forget the scene of overseas Chinese warmly welcoming "people sent by the motherland" as the Chinese trade delegation to Japan returned to Tokyo from Hakone, passing through Yokohama. One li away from the "Yokohama Chinese School" where the meeting was held, many people stood waiting in the rain. The teachers and students of the Chinese school, the heads of the Yokohama overseas Chinese organizations, the students' parents, bald old men, white-haired old ladies, and the school's students stood densely packed from the school gate all the way into the campus. They forgot about the rain and cold. They enthusiastically waved the national flag and applauded vigorously. Many people crowded at the windows of the classrooms on the second floor, waving continuously. I saw a head peeking out of the window, it was a young patient with white bandages wrapped around his head. The band played the solemn national anthem, and we were immersed in cheers. Such a scene may have been experienced by everyone in the country. However, when I followed the delegation up the stairs and stood in the corridor upstairs, looking at the jubilant crowd, everyone singing the national anthem together and shouting, "Long live Mao Zedong!" I could no longer hold back the tears in my eyes. When I visited Kang Mingqiu, the chairman of the Tokyo Overseas Chinese General Association and a deputy to the First National People's Congress of our country, he told me that after returning to Japan, he had given more than ten reports to more than ten thousand overseas Chinese in various places. Many people told me about their excitement after listening to the reports. Kang Mingqiu said to me: "Now, it is an honor to be a citizen of the People's Republic of China. The strength of the motherland and the improvement of its international status have also allowed overseas Chinese to hold their heads high." The rain was still falling. Hundreds of people stood in the rain, quietly listening to the care and expectations of the people of the motherland for the overseas Chinese in Japan brought by Delegation Leader Lei Renmin. I know how long they have been waiting for this voice! More than half a month ago, a few days after the delegation arrived in Tokyo, the overseas Chinese in Yokohama sent representatives to invite the delegation to Yokohama. They said, even if it's just for a few minutes, to meet everyone!
    The profound grief of the overseas Chinese in Japan for the national martyrs who died in Japan, and their voluntary actions to collect the remains of the martyrs in various places, condensed the tears and righteous indignation of tens of thousands of people, demonstrating their great patriotic enthusiasm.
    Five years ago, after the first batch of remains of martyrs who were massacred by the Japanese imperialist executioners were discovered in the Hanaoka area, the overseas Chinese in Japan donated 500,000 yen as a fund for transporting the ashes back to the country. Up to now, with the assistance of the peace-loving people of Japan, five batches of ashes have been sent back.
    After the first memorial service was held in Tokyo in 1950, the coffins of the martyrs were placed in Zao Temple, waiting for shipment. Near this Buddhist temple lived an old lady from Jiangsu named Yu Xingdi, who had no relationship with the deceased. People often saw her bringing flowers and offerings to the temple every few days, kneeling before the spirit tablets of the martyrs, burning incense and praying. This continued for two or three years without interruption. In Asahikawa City, Hokkaido, there are very few overseas Chinese. A young overseas Chinese named Wei Qinglong once went to the Northeast region alone to investigate and excavate the ashes more than ten times. From Asahikawa to the Northeast, you have to take a boat and a car, and one trip always takes most of a day. Wei Qinglong traveled back and forth tirelessly. When the first batch of ashes arrived in Kobe from Tokyo in 1953, ready to be shipped back to the country, there was only a three-day stopover at the port. The vast majority of overseas Chinese in Kobe participated in welcoming the ashes and the memorial service.
    When I was in Kobe, the overseas Chinese also talked to me about their feelings when they held memorial services for the martyrs. An old lady with bomb scars on one of her hands said bitterly that her three sons were taken to munitions factories to work by the Japanese imperialists during the war and were killed in the bombing. "We must never allow Japanese imperialism to harm people again," she said angrily. "I participated in the memorial service for the national martyrs as if I were mourning my dead sons. I will never forget the deep hatred of my children being killed." Another overseas Chinese, Chen Qingxiang, once said to me in Tokyo:
   "We not only have to dig the remains of our dead compatriots from the ground and let them see the light of day; we also hung the ash boxes on our chests and paraded on the streets of Tokyo. This is a warning to the warmongers, and it is our expression of defending our motherland and not allowing anyone to invade it."
    Taiwanese compatriots account for a large proportion of the overseas Chinese in Japan. Many of them drifted to Japan after experiencing the slave-like life under the Japanese imperialist occupation of Taiwan. At the Tokyo Overseas Chinese General Association, I met a technician. When he began to describe his life in his hometown of Taiwan, he burst into tears like a child. Later, he reluctantly suppressed his sobs and said that he wanted to contribute his skills to the construction of the motherland and support the liberation of Taiwan.
    When I asked the overseas Chinese I contacted what they wanted from the motherland, the first answer from most people was: We hope to liberate Taiwan as soon as possible and rescue the compatriots in Taiwan from their misery. The demand for the liberation of Taiwan has become the unanimous cry of patriotic overseas Chinese in Japan.

    千丝万缕的纽带
    本报记者　汪溪
    同志，你曾有过背井离乡，在生活的颠簸里，思念故乡亲人的体会么？你曾尝过读到千里外的平安家书的快乐么？
    我国旅居日本的侨胞，就是经常以这样的心情期待着祖国的。请听听他们对祖国同胞说的话吧！福建籍的华侨老人张加爵，从小就到了日本，住在日本六十多年了。他做过厨子，当过小商人，也干过切面条的手艺。这位经历了几次战争，尝尽了海外生活的艰难困苦的老人，颤抖抖而兴奋地说：“我活了七十二岁，没有比这几年更愉快的了。祖国独立富强起来了，我终于赶上这个日子。总算是熬出头来了。”一位来自河北省的姓李的农民，当我递给他一枝从祖国带来的香烟时，他沉默了好一会儿，然后，用带着很重的北方土音说道：“抽这枝香烟，我说不上心里是什么滋味……。”“同志，你也许没有受过这样的苦……。我十五岁时，家乡闹灾，连吃糠咽菜的日子也过不下去了。母亲托朋友把我带来日本找生活。唉！二十多年在外，就像是没娘的孩子，没吃过一天安逸饭。”他似乎很抱歉在众人面前提起了过去的悲痛，急忙转过话头：“你想咱们的祖国现在强大了，我在国内的家人都过起好日子来了。我大半辈子的苦总算没白吃。没娘的孩子，现在可找到家了。”
    在大阪一次酒会上，一位北京籍的老大娘带着她年轻的姑娘，走上前来同我打招呼。她说：“在这里听了家乡话……。”这句话没说完，就哽咽住了。她亲热地拉着我的手，不断地上下打量着，就好像是仔细端详她久别的孩子似的。“先生，咱们新中国的代表来了。咱们感到多大的光彩呵！让我好好地看看你们……，这几天我天天听广播，听雷任民团长的讲话。你们带来的电影，我在神户看过一次了，今晚还要再看……。”
    十九日下午，天下着雨。中国访日贸易代表团从箱根回到东京的路上，路经横滨时，华侨热情欢迎“祖国派来的人”的情景，我们将永远不能忘记。离开会场“横滨中华学校”一里路外，就有许多人在雨地里鹄立等待着。中华学校的师生，横滨华侨团体的负责人，学生的家长们，秃了顶的老人，白头发的老太太，和学校的学生从校门一直到校园里，站得密密实实的。他们忘记了雨和寒冷。一个个热情地挥舞着国旗，用力地鼓掌。许多人挤在二楼教室的窗口上，不停地招手。我看到窗口中探出一个头来，这是满头缠着白布绷带的一位年轻的病人。乐队奏着庄严的国歌，我们被融在一片欢呼声里。这样的场面，国内也许是谁都经历过的。但是，当我随着代表团登上了楼梯，站在楼上走廊里，望着那欢腾的人群，大家齐唱国歌，同呼：“毛泽东万岁！”的时候，我再也含不住眼睛里的泪水了。当我访问东京华侨总会会长、我国第一届全国人民代表大会代表康鸣球时，他告诉我，他回到日本以后，曾到各地向一万多华侨作了十次以上的报告。许多人都向我说到过他们听报告以后的兴奋。康鸣球对我说：“现在，作为中华人民共和国的侨民是可以引为荣幸的。祖国的强大，国际地位的提高，使海外的侨民也抬起头来了。”雨还在下着。几百个人就立在雨地上，静听雷任民团长带来的祖国人民对旅日侨胞的关怀和期望。我知道，这是他们期待了多久的声音啊！半个多月前，代表团到达东京后没几天，横滨侨胞就派出了代表，邀请代表团到横滨去。他们说，那怕只是去几分钟，和大家见见面吧！
    旅日侨胞对在日本殉难的祖国烈士的那种情同骨肉的哀悼，和他们自动地到各地去收集烈士遗体的行动，凝结着几万人的眼泪和义愤，显示了他们伟大的爱国热情。
    五年以前，从在花冈地方发现第一批被日本帝国主义刽子手屠杀了的烈士遗体之后，旅日华侨曾捐献了五十万日圆，作为运送骨灰回国的基金。到现在，在日本爱好和平的人民协助下，已经先后送回了五批骨灰。
    一九五○年在东京举行了第一次追悼大会后，烈士们的灵柩停放在枣寺里，等待启运。就在这个佛庙附近，住着一位江苏籍的老太太余杏弟，她同死难者是无亲无故的。人们隔几天就碰到她带着鲜花供品到庙里去，跪倒在烈士的灵位前，焚香祷拜。这样继续了两三年，没有间断。北海道的旭川市，旅居华侨很少。这里的一位侨胞、年轻的韦清龙曾独自到东北地方去调查和挖掘骨灰，前后不下十多次。从旭川到东北要乘船坐车，一次旅程总需要大半天的时间。韦清龙不顾疲劳来往奔波着。当一九五三年，第一批骨灰从东京运抵神户，准备启运回国时，在港口前后只有三天的停留。神户华侨参加迎接骨灰和追悼大会的占绝大多数。
    我在神户时，侨胞们也同我谈起他们为烈士们开追悼会时的心情。有一位一只手上带着炸弹的伤痕的老大娘，她的三个儿子在战争中被日本帝国主义者拉到军火工厂去做工，在轰炸中牺牲了。她愤愤地说：“我们决不能允许日本帝国主义再来祸害人了。我参加追悼祖国烈士的大会，就像是追悼我死去的儿子一样。我孩子被杀害的深仇，我是永远也忘不了的。”另一位侨胞陈庆祥在东京曾对我说：
  “我们不但要把死难同胞的遗体从地下挖出来，让它们见见天日；我们也曾把骨灰箱挂在胸前，在东京的大街上游行。这就是对战争贩子的警告，就是我们保卫祖国不容许任何人侵犯的表示。”
    旅日侨胞中台湾籍的占很大比例。他们很多是经历过日本帝国主义占领台湾时的奴隶般的生活而辗转流亡到日本来的。在东京华侨总会，我见到一个技术工人。当他开始叙述在故乡台湾的生活时，就像孩子似地失声哭起来了。后来，他勉强忍着哽咽，说他要把技术贡献给祖国的建设，支援解放台湾。
    当我问我接触到的侨胞，他们对祖国有什么要求时，多数人的第一个答案都是：希望早日解放台湾，把台湾的同胞从水深火热中解救出来。要求解放台湾已成为旅日爱国侨胞的一致呼声。
                      四月二十三日于东京
