	Cherish Talent for the Nation
	Ji Wenfu, Acting President of Henan Normal College
	For several years, in order to adapt to the needs of large-scale socialist construction, and to cultivate a large number of qualified construction talents, our country has not only squeezed out a large amount of manpower, financial resources, and materials from all kinds of difficulties to develop education, but also reformed the system, adjusted departments, and thought of various ways to intensify training. Why is this? Because we lack talent too much, and the country's construction needs are too urgent. Under these circumstances, we cannot but demand that we pay special attention to the allocation and use of talent, and place every professional talent cultivated in the place where they are most needed and where they can best play their role. We must never waste talent, and we must be especially careful to cherish talent for the country.

	However, in fact, the phenomenon of not being able to rationally use university graduates and wasting talent is seriously present. Some departments, when allocating and using graduates, did not carefully consider the nature and use of their majors, placing professional talent in positions that did not utilize what they had learned. Those who studied heating and ventilation were sent to investigate the names, quantities, and performance of machinery, while those who studied machinery were sent to work on heating and ventilation. Those who studied architectural design were sent to do labor insurance registration, those who studied metal cutting were sent to be Russian language tutors, and those who studied food processing were sent to purchase chicken and duck feathers. Even as described in the article "Depressed 'Journey'": Several young people who graduated from the mineral analysis specialty, because the places where they were assigned to work simply did not need people like them, were made to run around and be rejected everywhere, making a depressed "journey" back and forth in vain on the vast land of the motherland, which was simply like deliberately tormenting people. This phenomenon is really too intolerable.

	It is not easy to train a university graduate. The state, according to the plan, sets specifications and puts forward the task of training talent to schools. Teachers, in order to train qualified talents, spare no effort, study their profession, and even every class hour, every link, every example, every explanation, must be repeatedly deliberated and discussed to make it have a clear purpose, for fear of wasting a little time, not conforming to the training goals, not conforming to the requirements of national construction. As for young students, for the sake of national construction, they enthusiastically and selflessly devote themselves to professional study, for fear of not being able to complete their studies, not being suitable for the job, and failing to live up to the country's training. But when it comes to graduation assignment, they encounter such an "utterly unreasonable attitude," regardless of what the major is, what the specifications are, and they are casually thrown away and it's done. If talent is used in this way, then all the training goals and teaching plans set by the school are completely unnecessary, and the efforts of teachers and students to pay so much attention to them are all in vain! I think a teacher who is wholeheartedly serving the construction of the motherland, seeing the professional talent he has personally cultivated being so casually wasted, how heartbroken he must be! When students first enter the school, for fear that they will not study their majors well, they use various methods to establish their "professional ideology." But after graduation, when they arrive at their jobs, some units want to establish their "career change ideology" for the graduates they send to work. The contrast before and after is really an ironic situation that makes people laugh and cry!

	Of course, the causes of this irrational phenomenon are not simple, and it cannot be said that the departments that allocate and use talent are solely responsible. Our planned construction has just begun, and the accuracy of various plans is inevitably problematic. The school's plan to train talent may not be fully adapted to the real needs of the business departments, which will naturally increase the difficulty of allocation and use, and thus it is inevitable that those unreasonable phenomena will occur. But in any case, that bureaucratic "utterly unreasonable attitude" is always a major reason for causing this unreasonable phenomenon, or at least contributing to it. Naturally, this irrational phenomenon is also caused by the fact that talent is too scarce and the needs are urgent, so that "there is no time to choose carefully" and "mistakes are made in the rush." But precisely because of the lack of talent, we must especially cherish talent and not allow any waste. If you say: because of the lack of talent, we have to waste talent, what kind of logic is this! Naturally, we also know that various departments also consider, study, and repeatedly consider the allocation and use of talent, and generally can do it appropriately and reasonably. Although the unreasonable phenomena mentioned above are not universal, they are serious enough.

	We should deeply recognize that talent is the most valuable asset of the country, especially when our country's construction urgently needs talent, wasting talent is more serious than wasting any material, and the damage to national construction is immeasurable. We should respect the labor achievements of others, and do not easily throw the results of years of hard work by teachers and years of hard study by young people into useless places. We must patiently and humbly listen to the opinions of those who are allocated and used, and analyze them specifically, and do not casually put on big hats. It must be known that if we spend a little more effort and take a little more trouble to make the use of talent more rational, more economical and effective, this is the most valuable contribution to the construction of the motherland. Whoever does not cherish talent shows that he does not care about the construction of the motherland. This is not a small problem!

### 为国家爱惜人材

    为国家爱惜人材
    河南师范学院代院长　嵇文甫
      几年以来，为着适应大规模社会主义建设的需要，为着培养出大批合用的各种建设人材，我们国家不仅从百般困难中挤出大量人力、财力、物力来发展教育事业，并且改革制度、调整院系，想出各种办法，来加紧培养。为什么要这样？因为我们的人材太缺乏，国家建设的需要太迫切了。在这种情况下，自然不能不要求我们对于人材的分配和使用格外讲究节约和合理，把培养出来的每一个专业人材都要安放在最需要和最能发挥他们的作用的地方。我们决不可使人材浪费，而一定要特别当心，为国家爱惜人材。
    然而事实上，不能合理使用高等学校毕业生，浪费人材的现象，是严重存在的。有些部门在分配和使用毕业生时，没有很好考虑专业的性质和用途，把专业人材放到了用非所学的位置上。学暖气通风的会派去做调查机械名称、数量、性能等工作，而学机械的倒派去搞暖气通风。学建筑设计的会派去搞劳动保险登记，学金属切削加工的会派去当俄文辅导员，学食品加工的会派去收购毛鸡毛鸭。甚至如“苦闷的‘旅行’”那篇文章里所述：几位在矿物分析专修科毕业的青年，由于分配他们去工作的地方根本不需要他们那样的人材，让他们跑来跑去，到处碰壁，在祖国辽阔的大地上，徒劳往返地作苦闷的“旅行”，简直像故意折磨人。这种现象实在太使人不能容忍了。
    培养出一个高等学校毕业生是不容易的。国家按照计划，限定规格，向学校提出培养人材的任务。教师们为着培养出合乎规格的人材，费尽心血，钻研业务，连每一个课时，每一个环节，每一个举例，每一个说明，都要反覆推敲讨论，使其具有明确的目的性，惟恐浪费一点时间，不合乎培养的目标，不合乎国家建设的要求。至于青年学生，为着祖国建设，热情地、忘我地投入专业的学习，惟恐不能完成学习任务，到工作岗位上不合用，有负国家的培养。可是一到毕业分配工作时，却遇到那样“简直岂有此理的态度”，什么专业不专业，规格不规格，随手抛掷出去就算完事。照这样来使用人材，那末学校所定种种培养目标、教学计划，根本都用不着，教者、学者，辛辛苦苦，讲究那末些，岂不都是白费！我想一个忠心耿耿为祖国建设服务的教师，看见他亲手培养出来的专业人材被那样随便蹧踏，他该是多么痛心吧！当学生一入校时，惟恐他们对于所学的专业不肯好好学习，所以使用各种方法去树立他们的“专业思想”。可是毕业后一到工作岗位上，有的单位对于派去做工作的毕业生又要去树立他们的“改行思想”。前后对照，实在是令人哭笑不得的一个讽刺！
    自然，这种不合理现象的造成，原因也并不简单，不能说全由分配和使用人材的部门负责。我们的计划建设刚刚开始，各种计划的准确性还难免有问题。学校培养人材的计划，不见得和事业部门的真实需要完全适应，这自然要增加分配和使用上的困难，因而也就难免发生那些不合理的现象。但无论如何，那种官僚主义的“简直岂有此理的态度”，总是造成这种不合理现象，至少是助长这种不合理现象的一个主要原因。自然，这种不合理现象的造成，也由于人材太缺，需要迫切，以致“急不暇择”，“忙中有错”。但是正由于人材缺乏，所以我们必须格外爱惜人材，不使有一点浪费才对。如果说：因为缺乏人材，所以不得不浪费人材，这成个什么逻辑！自然，我们也知道各部门对于人材的分配和使用，也是多方考虑，反复研究，而且一般的也都能做到恰当合理，像上面所举那些不合理的现象虽然不是普遍的，可是就这样也就够严重了。
      我们应该深切认识，人材是国家最宝贵的财产，特别是正当我们国家建设迫切需要人材的时候，浪费人材比浪费任何物资都严重，这对于国家建设的损害是无可估量的。我们应该尊重旁人的劳动成果，不要把教师们多年辛苦培养、青年们多年辛苦学习的成绩，轻易抛掷到无用的地方。我们要耐烦地、虚心地倾听一下被分配和使用者的意见，加以具体分析，不要随便扣大帽子。须知我们多费一点心血，多受一点麻烦，使人材的使用更合理些、更节约而有效些，这就是对于祖国建设最可宝贵的贡献。谁要是不爱惜人材，就说明他对于祖国建设事业不关心。这可不是个小问题呀！
