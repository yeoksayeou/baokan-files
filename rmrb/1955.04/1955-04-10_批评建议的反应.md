Responses to Criticisms and Suggestions

    Team 342 Corrects Wasteful Practices

    A letter from Team 342 of the Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry: The letter "A Large Number of Machine Tools 'Scrapped'" published in the "Letters from Readers" section of the People's Daily on January 30 exposed our team's waste of state funds. We felt the issue was serious and immediately conducted an inspection. We sincerely accept this criticism, remember this lesson, and strive to improve our future work. The main reason for these mistakes is that the leading cadres of the team were not well-informed about the equipment and had a vague understanding of the purpose and task of geological exploration, resulting in the blind purchase of equipment. To improve our work, we have taken some measures to prevent similar errors from occurring. We have recommended that the leader give the deputy section chief of the electromechanical section, Liu Wanxing, who is directly responsible for the blind purchase of new equipment and the scrapping of old equipment, the necessary punishment according to the circumstances.

    Wanquan County Discourages Farmers from Flowing into Cities

    A letter from the Wanquan County People's Government, Hebei Province: Comrade Du Chunfang's criticism in the March 13th issue of the Old Sheep Wool Village Township Government randomly introducing farmer Li Guo to find work in Mentougou is correct. We have criticized and educated the township government, pointing out that the blind flow of farmers into cities is detrimental to the current construction cause, and that rural cadres should actively educate farmers to work hard in production and support industrial construction. At the same time, similar situations exist in other townships in our county, so we have also issued instructions to discourage farmers from blindly flowing into cities, emphasizing that the township people's committees should help farmers carry out spring ploughing and should not issue letters of introduction casually in the future. The occurrence of this phenomenon shows that our past implementation of labor policies was not thorough enough. In the future, we must constantly educate farmers to be content with production and help solve production problems to prevent similar situations from happening again.

    Review of Citrus Fruit Purchasing Work

    A letter from the Jintang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Sichuan: The People's Daily published Comrade Fang Yisheng's letter "Fruit Farmers in Jintang County Request Cooperatives to Purchase Mandarin Oranges and Tangerines" on January 30. We sincerely accept his criticism and respond as follows:

      In 1954, Jintang County had a bumper harvest of mandarin oranges and tangerines, reaching
  more than 11.95 million catties, and the market supply was very concentrated. At that time, because we underestimated the bumper harvest situation, and in the first few days of the citrus fruits coming onto the market, we adopted the practice of prioritizing public interests over private interests in order to ensure the quality and task of the entrusted purchasing units, and we managed the market too tightly, which affected the enthusiasm of small vendors to transport and sell. As a result, the citrus fruits were unsalable. Later, thanks to the mobilization and organization of vendors from other counties by higher authorities to purchase, and we also mobilized local farmers to strengthen storage and self-transportation for external sales, the tense situation in the market was basically reversed by the end of December. From the time the citrus fruits began to be marketed until February 10, state-owned and cooperative purchasing units and private merchants purchased a total of 44,232 dan of tangerines, accounting for 55.5 percent of the total production; and 29,679 dan of mandarin oranges, accounting for 74.5 percent of the total production.

    The Preparatory Committee of the Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Sichuan Provincial Company of the China Food Company also wrote letters one after another, expressing sincere acceptance of Comrade Fang Yisheng's criticism and conducted self-examinations.

    The Preparatory Committee of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative reviewed that the implementation of the policy of utilizing small vendors was not strict enough, and it did not pay attention to preventing deviations in advance, which caused problems in the arrangement of the Jintang County tangerine and mandarin orange market. At the same time, it did not have a sufficient understanding of the annual output of Jintang tangerines and mandarin oranges and the bumper harvest situation in 1954, and it did not correct the problem of the Chengdu Municipal Cooperative Federation's mandarin orange purchasing plan being too small in time (the Chengdu Municipal Cooperative Federation is one of the units entrusted by the Jintang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative to purchase). The Sichuan Provincial Company of the Food Company reviewed that it did not actively cooperate with relevant parties to ascertain the output of Jintang tangerines and mandarin oranges, but instead transferred a portion of mandarin oranges from Jiangjin to the Chengdu market, which affected the timely sale of Jintang fruit farmers' mandarin oranges and tangerines.

    Both of the above units stated that they would accept the lessons and improve their work.

### 批评建议的反应

专栏：批评建议的反应

    批评建议的反应
    三四二勘探队纠正浪费现象
    重工业部地质局三四二勘探队来信：人民日报一月三十日“读者来信专页”上刊登的“大批工作母机‘报废’以后”一信，揭发了我队浪费国家资金的行为。我们感到问题是严重的，立刻进行了检查。我们诚恳地接受这一批评，并记住这个教训，努力改进今后的工作。发生这些错误的主要原因，是队的领导干部对设备心中无数，对地质勘探工作的目的和任务，认识很模糊，造成盲目购置设备现象。为了改进工作，我们已采取了一些措施以防止类似错误的发生。对这次造成盲目购置新设备和报废旧设备的直接责任者机电科副科长刘万兴，已建议领导根据情节予以必要的处分。
    万全县劝阻农民流入城市
    河北省万全县人民政府来信：三月十三日杜春芳同志对我县旧羊毛屯乡乡政府随便介绍农民李国到门头沟找工作的批评是正确的。我们已对该乡乡政府进行了批评教育，指出农民盲目流入城市对当前的建设事业是不利的，乡村干部应该积极教育农民努力生产，支援工业建设。同时我县别的乡也有类似情况，所以我们又发出了劝阻农民盲目流入城市的指示，强调了乡人民委员会应该帮助农民进行春耕生产，今后不得随便乱开介绍信。这种现象的发生，说明我们过去对劳动政策贯彻得不够深入。今后我们一定要经常地教育农民安心生产，并帮助解决生产上的问题，防止类似的情况再发生。
    对收购柑橘工作的检讨
    四川金堂县供销合作社来信：人民日报于一月三十日发表了方以绳同志的“金堂县果农要求合作社收购广柑和橘子”的来信，我们诚恳地接受他的批评，并答复如下：
      一九五四年金堂县广柑、橘子普遍丰产，达到
  一千一百九十五万多斤，上市量非常集中。当时，由于我们对丰产情况估计不足，同时在柑、橘开始上市的起初几天内，我们为了保证托购单位的质量和任务，又采取了先公后私的作法，把市场管得过死，影响了小商贩贩运的积极性。以致造成了柑、橘滞销的情况。后来，由于上级机关发动和组织了外县贩运商来采购，同时我们又动员当地农民加强储存保管和自运外销，到十二月下旬，就基本上扭转了市场的紧张状况。从柑、橘开始上市起直到二月十日止，国营、合作社营收购单位和私商一共收购了橘子四万四千二百三十二担，占总产量的百分之五十五点五；收购了广柑二万九千六百七十九担，占总产量的百分之七十四点五。
    四川省供销合作社筹备委员会、中国食品公司四川省公司也先后来信，表示诚恳接受方以绳同志的批评，并作了检查。
    供销合作社筹备委员会检讨了对执行利用小商贩的政策贯彻不够严格，没有事先注意防止偏向，致使金堂县橘、柑市场的安排上发生了问题。同时对金堂橘、柑历年的产量和一九五四年的丰产情况了解不够，对成都市合作社联社收购柑橘计划偏小的毛病没有及时纠正（成都市联社是委托金堂县供销社代购单位之一）。食品公司四川省公司检讨了没有主动配合有关方面摸清金堂柑、橘产量，反从江津调了一部分广柑到成都市场，以致影响了金堂果农的柑、橘不能及时出售。
    以上两个单位都表示要接受教训，改进工作。
