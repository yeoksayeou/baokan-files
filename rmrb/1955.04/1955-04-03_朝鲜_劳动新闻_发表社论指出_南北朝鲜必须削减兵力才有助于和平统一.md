Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 2nd. The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on the 1st, entitled "The Military Strength of North and South Korea Must Be Reduced."

The editorial also said: The Chinese people, who have consistently strived to maintain peace in Korea and peacefully resolve the Korean issue, have withdrawn seven divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteers last year, and are now withdrawing six more divisions. This is another major effort by the Chinese people to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, which has given the Korean people new encouragement. In contrast, the American aggressors openly clamor to send more troops to South Korea and illegally transport reinforcements of weapons. This is intolerable to the Korean people. We demand that U.S. troops withdraw from South Korea immediately, and we demand that an international conference of relevant countries be held to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

The editorial said: Maintaining and consolidating peace in Korea and realizing the peaceful reunification of Korea are the national aspirations of all Korean people. However, due to the obstruction of the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee clique, this aspiration has not been realized nearly two years after the armistice.

The editorial pointed out: The United States and the Syngman Rhee clique are constantly undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement and expanding the puppet army, seriously threatening peace in Korea.

The editorial pointed out: Under these circumstances, the Korean people must further strengthen the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. If the proposal to reduce the armies of North and South Korea to 100,000 respectively is realized, it will greatly help the peaceful reunification of Korea, and it can greatly reduce the burden of huge military expenditures on the people of South Korea.

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表社论指出
    南北朝鲜必须削减兵力才有助于和平统一
    新华社平壤二日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”一日发表社论，题目是“南北朝鲜的兵力必须削减”。
    社论又说：为维护朝鲜和平、和平解决朝鲜问题而一贯努力的中国人民继去年撤回中国人民志愿军七个师之后，现在又撤回六个师，这是中国人民为和平解决朝鲜问题的又一次重大努力，它给了朝鲜人民新的鼓舞力量。和这相反，美国侵略者却公开叫嚣要增派军队到南朝鲜，并非法运进增援武器。这是朝鲜人民决不能容忍的。我们要求美军立即从南朝鲜撤走，并且要求召开有关国家的国际会议以和平解决朝鲜问题。
    社论说：维护和巩固朝鲜的和平、实现朝鲜的和平统一，是全体朝鲜人民的民族愿望。但是，由于美国侵略者和李承晚集团的百般阻挠，在停战后将近两年的今天，这个愿望还没有能够实现。
    社论指出：美国和李承晚集团不断破坏朝鲜停战协定和扩充伪军，严重地威胁着朝鲜和平。
    社论指出：在这种情况下，朝鲜人民必须进一步加强争取和平统一祖国的斗争。南北朝鲜的军队分别削减到十万人的建议如果获得实现，将大大有助于朝鲜的和平统一，而且可以大为减轻南朝鲜人民对庞大的军费开支的负担。
