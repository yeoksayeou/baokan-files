No Using International Treaties as a Smokescreen
Tan Wenrui
    In the wake of the British and French governments and parliaments signing and ratifying the Paris Agreements, the Soviet Council of Ministers, in accordance with the Soviet government's previously elucidated position, has proposed to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR the abrogation of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance in the war against Hitlerite Germany and its collaborators in Europe and of post-war cooperation and mutual assistance, as well as the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance. This step by the Soviet government is entirely justified and necessary.

    As everyone knows, both World Wars were launched by German militarists. These wars caused endless disasters for the people of the world, especially the people of Europe. The people of the Soviet Union, France, and Britain endured enormous sacrifices in order to defeat the aggression of German militarism. Their common struggle also aroused a yearning for common security. Therefore, in the difficult days of the Second World War, first Britain and the Soviet Union, and then France and the Soviet Union, signed the Anglo-Soviet and Franco-Soviet treaties respectively. These two treaties not only stipulated the obligations of the Soviet Union with Britain and France to fight together against fascist Germany, but also stipulated that the contracting parties should fully cooperate after the war to prevent the revival of German militarism.

    This solidarity and cooperation among the anti-fascist allied countries played a huge role in promoting the victory of the war against Hitlerite Germany. The Soviet Union fought against Germany with all its strength during the war, helped Britain overcome the deadly threat of Nazi forces, and enabled France to be liberated from the iron heel of the German aggressors. After the war, the Soviet Union faithfully fulfilled the obligations stipulated in the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Franco-Soviet Treaty, and made unremitting efforts to prevent the revival of German militarism and ensure European security. If the other contracting parties to these two treaties could also be as faithful to the obligations stipulated in the treaties as the Soviet Union, then these treaties would certainly be able to maintain the vitality they had during the war and play a significant role in ensuring European security and world peace.

    However, the British and French governments were unwilling to do so. Not only were they unwilling to make efforts to prevent the revival of German militarism, but they instead signed the Paris Agreements to rearm West Germany. This agreement, both in letter and in spirit, is completely incompatible with the obligations undertaken by Britain and France in the Anglo-Soviet and Franco-Soviet treaties. The Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Franco-Soviet Treaty both stipulated that the contracting parties should take all necessary measures after the war to eliminate any new threat from Germany and prevent any actions that might create new German aggression attempts; at the same time, they also stipulated that the contracting parties undertake not to conclude or join any alliance or group directed against the other contracting party. However, Britain and France followed the United States' so-called "strength" policy, signed the Paris Agreements with West Germany and other Western countries, allowing the West German militarist forces to rebuild their aggressive armies, and dragged West Germany into the "Western European Union" and the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, in which Britain and France participated, with the aim of attacking the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries in Europe. In this way, Britain and France abandoned the obligations they had undertaken in the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Franco-Soviet Treaty, treating these treaties written with the blood of the Soviet, British and French people as waste paper. In this way, they followed the United States, allowing the flames of war rekindled twice by German militarism to once again threaten the people of Europe and the people of the world. This situation naturally renders the existence of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Franco-Soviet Treaty meaningless.

    The Soviet government has warned the British and French governments more than once that the act of ratifying the Paris Agreements would invalidate the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Franco-Soviet Treaty; and that the British government and the French government would bear full responsibility for this. This warning from the Soviet Union stemmed from the maintenance of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Franco-Soviet Treaty, in order to prevent the revival of German militarism, and to ensure peace and security in Europe and the world. The Soviet Union's warning should have prompted the British and French governments to pay attention to the serious consequences caused by their ratification and implementation of the Paris Agreements.

    However, the British and French ruling cliques turned a deaf ear to the Soviet Union's warnings. They wholeheartedly followed the policies of the US aggressive bloc and insisted on taking the road of reviving German militarism. Now both Britain and France have ratified the Paris Agreements and are preparing to implement this agreement as soon as possible. This shows that the British and French ruling cliques are determined to form an alliance with their former enemy, the German militarists, to oppose their allies, the Soviet Union, who shared their hardships during the war. In this situation, the continued existence of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Franco-Soviet Treaty is not only meaningless, but will only be used by those who violate these treaties as a smokescreen to cover up their revival of German militarism.

    Once the Paris Agreements are implemented, the European situation will undergo a fundamental change, and the danger of a new war will greatly increase. However, the supporters of the Paris Agreements in London and Paris are trying to conceal the truth of this fact. They insist that the Paris Agreements, which revive German militarism, do not conflict with the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Franco-Soviet Treaty, which prevent new German aggression. French Prime Minister Faure recently even said: he believes that the Paris Agreements "both in their spirit and in their content, are fully in line with the obligations that France has undertaken towards the Soviet Union...". A British Foreign Office spokesman also said: the British government believes that "the claim that the Paris Agreements are incompatible with the Anglo-Soviet Treaty is untenable". The British and French ruling cliques are clearly trying to shirk their responsibility for destroying the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Franco-Soviet Treaty, and are attempting to deceive the British and French people, so that they cannot see the serious dangers of implementing the Paris Agreements.

    This deceptive trick of the British and French ruling cliques will not have any effect. The broad masses of the British and French people cherish their friendship and cooperation with the Soviet people. They recognize the enormous significance of maintaining the alliance and mutual assistance treaty with the Soviet Union for the security of their countries and the peace of Europe. The British and French people also clearly know that the entire responsibility for the abrogation of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Franco-Soviet Treaty must be borne by the British and French ruling cliques who are implementing the Paris Agreements. Even the French bourgeois newspaper "Le Monde" wrote: "To rearm West Germany against the wishes of one of the main occupying powers of Germany is to openly consecrate the overthrow of the alliance (with the Soviet Union)", therefore the Soviet Union "has the right to declare this practice incompatible with the provisions of the 1944 treaty".

    The Soviet Union's action to abrogate the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Franco-Soviet Treaty will redouble the vigilance of the European people against the war conspiracies of the Western aggressive bloc and strengthen their struggle against the revival of German militarism. Although the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Franco-Soviet Treaty have been cancelled by the British and French ruling cliques, the solidarity and friendship between the Soviet people and the British and French people will not only not be weakened, but will continue to be strengthened. They once shed blood together and defeated the aggression of German militarism; they will also resolutely fight back against the heinous conspiracy of the aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism to revive German militarism, and fight to the end to defend peace.

    不许把国际条约当做烟幕
    谭文瑞
    在英法两国政府和议会签订和批准了巴黎协定的情况下，苏联部长会议根据苏联政府早已阐明的态度，已向苏联最高苏维埃主席团提出了废除英苏缔结的战时反对希特勒德国及其欧洲与国和战后合作互助同盟条约和法苏同盟互助条约的建议。苏联政府的这一步骤是完全正当的和必要的。
    大家知道，两次世界战争都是德国军国主义者发动的。这些战争使世界人民，特别是欧洲人民，遭受了无穷的灾难。苏联、法国、英国的人民，为了战胜德国军国主义的侵略，曾经忍受过巨大的牺牲。他们进行的共同斗争也就激起了对于共同的安全的渴望。因此，在第二次大战的艰难的日子里，首先是英国同苏联，然后是法国同苏联分别签订了英苏、法苏两个条约。这两个条约不仅规定了苏联同英国和法国对法西斯德国共同作战的义务，并且也规定了缔约国在战后全力合作来防止德国军国主义的复活。
    反法西斯同盟国家的这种团结合作，对于促进反对希特勒德国战争的胜利起了巨大的作用。苏联在战争期间全力对德作战，帮助英国克服了纳粹势力对它的致命威胁，使法国能够从德国侵略者的铁蹄下解放出来。在战后，苏联忠实地履行了英苏条约和法苏条约所规定的义务，为防止德国军国主义的复活和保障欧洲的安全作了不懈的努力。如果这两个条约的其他缔约国，也能像苏联一样地忠实于条约所规定的义务，那末，这些条约就一定能够保持它们在战时具有的生命力，对保障欧洲的安全和世界和平发挥重大的作用。
    但是，英国政府和法国政府并不愿意这样做。它们不但不肯努力防止德国军国主义的复活，相反的却签订了重新武装西德的巴黎协定。这个协定无论在文字上和精神上都和英国以及法国在英苏和法苏条约中所承担的义务绝不相容。英苏条约和法苏条约都规定缔约国在战后应当采取一切必要措施，以消灭任何来自德国方面的新威胁，并且阻止可能造成德国新侵略企图的任何行动；同时还规定缔约国承诺决不缔结或加入反对缔约国另一方的同盟和集团。但是，英国和法国却追随美国的所谓“实力”政策，同西德以及其他西方国家签订巴黎协定，容许西德军国主义势力重建其侵略军队，并且把西德拉进有英国和法国参加的、目的在于进攻苏联和欧洲其他爱好和平国家的“西欧联盟”和北大西洋侵略集团。这样，英国和法国就背弃了它们在英苏条约和法苏条约中所承担的义务，把这些用苏联和英法人民的鲜血写成的条约视同废纸。这样，它们就跟着美国，使德国军国主义两次燃烧起来的战火重新威胁着欧洲人民和世界人民。这种情况当然使英苏条约和法苏条约的存在毫无意义。
    苏联政府曾经不止一次地向英法政府提出警告：批准巴黎协定的举动将会使英苏条约和法苏条约作废；而英国政府和法国政府对此要负完全的责任。苏联的这种警告，是从维护英苏条约、法苏条约出发的，是为了阻止德国军国主义的复活，为了保障欧洲和世界的和平和安全。苏联的警告本来是应该能够促使英国和法国政府注意到它们批准和实施巴黎协定所造成的严重后果的。
    可是，英国和法国统治集团却对苏联的警告置若罔闻。它们死心塌地追随美国侵略集团的政策，坚持走复活德国军国主义的道路。现在英国和法国都已批准了巴黎协定，并准备尽速使这一协定付诸实施。这就表明了英国和法国统治集团，一心要同它们昔日的敌人德国军国主义者结成同盟来反对它们在战争时期共患难的盟友——苏联。在这种情况下，英苏条约和法苏条约的继续存在不但是毫无意义，而且只会被破坏这些条约的人们利用为掩盖它们复活德国军国主义的烟幕。
    巴黎协定一旦实施，欧洲局势就会发生根本变化，新战争的危险就会大大增加。可是伦敦和巴黎的巴黎协定拥护者却力图掩饰这种事实的真相。他们硬说复活德国军国主义的巴黎协定同防止德国新侵略的英苏条约和法苏条约毫不抵触。法国总理富尔最近还说：他认为巴黎协定“无论从它们的精神还是从它们的内容上来说，都是完全符合法国对苏联……承担的义务的”。英国外交部发言人也说：英国政府认为“巴黎协定和英苏条约不相容的说法是不能成立的”。英国和法国统治集团显然是想推卸它们破坏英苏条约和法苏条约的责任，并且企图蒙蔽英国和法国人民，使他们看不到实施巴黎协定的严重危险。
    英法统治集团的这种欺骗伎俩是不会有什么效果的。英国和法国广大人民珍视他们同苏联人民的友谊和合作。他们认识到维护同苏联的同盟互助条约对于他们国家的安全和欧洲的和平有着何等巨大的意义。英国和法国人民也清楚地知道废除英苏条约和法苏条约的全部责任，要由实施巴黎协定的英国和法国统治集团来负担。甚至法国资产阶级的报纸“世界报”都曾写道：“违背占领德国的主要国家之一的意愿来重新武装西德，这是把推翻（同苏联的）联盟公开神圣化”，因此苏联“有权宣布这种做法同一九四四年条约的条款不相容”。
    苏联废除英苏条约和法苏条约的行动，将要加倍提高欧洲人民对西方侵略集团战争阴谋的警惕，加强他们反对复活德国军国主义的斗争。英苏条约和法苏条约虽然已被英国和法国统治集团勾销了，但是苏联人民同英国和法国人民的团结和友谊不仅不会被削弱，而且将会继续加强。他们曾经在一道共同流血，击败了德国军国主义的侵略；他们也要坚决反击以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团复活德国军国主义的罪恶阴谋，为保卫和平而斗争到底。
