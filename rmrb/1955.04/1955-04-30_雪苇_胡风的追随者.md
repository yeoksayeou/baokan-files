    Xue Wei - A Follower of Hu Feng
  　Lin Mohan
    In recent months, the academic and literary circles have launched a comprehensive criticism of Hu Feng's literary and artistic thought, exposing the anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist essence of Hu Feng's thought. It can be seen that the emergence of this kind of thought has a certain social foundation, and it is a reflection of reactionary bourgeois thought in the literary and artistic field. Therefore, it is by no means surprising that there are some people in the literary and artistic circles who echo or share Hu Feng's thought. Therefore, a thorough criticism of Hu Feng and his followers' thought is a very necessary task.
    Xue Wei is one of those who have long faithfully followed Hu Feng, and his literary and artistic thought is basically consistent with Hu Feng's.
    Xue Wei has published four books in recent years. Among them, his "Collected Past Works" and "On the Orientation of Literature for Workers, Peasants and Soldiers" are particularly noteworthy. "Collected Past Works" was published in Dalian in 1948 and was later renamed "Two Rooms Collection" and "Essays, Volume One," repeatedly reprinted, which shows the author's emphasis on it. Although some of the articles were written in 1936, the author specifically stated in the "Small Introduction" to the book that his views had not changed, that those theories were "still not outdated," and that he believed it would still be "beneficial" "for young friends today" to read them. "On the Orientation of Literature for Workers, Peasants and Soldiers" was written in 1948.
    In these "still not outdated" and "beneficial" works, one can see that Xue Wei used many beautiful words to praise Hu Feng's literary and artistic thought. He extolled Hu Feng's essay collection "Literary Notes" as "brilliant theory," "the beginning of a new theory," and also possessing "great principle significance" (emphasis in the original). He said that the tradition of realist theory pioneered by Lu Xun and built by Qu Qiubai and Feng Xuefeng, "only" in Hu Feng's "Literary Notes" "got inherited". Parallel with this praise, Xue Wei, like Hu Feng, also used extremely vicious words to curse Marxism and the scientific worldview.
    Xue Wei opposed the scientific worldview as early as 1936 and has maintained this view ever since. We know that around 1936, a debate took place in Shanghai's left-wing literary and artistic circles. In this debate, on the one hand, it showed the sacred demand to unite the broad masses of writers and artists to devote themselves to the then anti-Japanese national self-defense struggle; on the other hand, it also exposed the dogmatism and sectarianism errors that had long not been correctly overcome in the left-wing literary and artistic circles. However, the main reason for these errors, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, was that the literary and artistic circles at that time had not solved the fundamental problem of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Revolutionary writers and artists had not truly stood on the position of the working class, and they still lacked a common and clear goal of struggle. Therefore, many debates and disagreements occurred on some relatively minor or even unprincipled issues. However, Xue Wei and Hu Feng and others, under the guise of anti-dogmatism and anti-sectarianism, took the opportunity to viciously attack and slander Marxist theory and the Marxist worldview. According to their absurd statement, the root cause of shortcomings or errors in literary and artistic work was not that literary and artistic workers lacked a correct position and viewpoint, but rather that some people advocated that writers study Marxism and grasp the scientific worldview. They believed that the only thing needed for literature and art was their so-called "truth" and "freedom." Obviously, this is a theory that hates Marxism, and it is precisely "inherited" from Liang Shiqiu's "Theory of Human Nature" and Hu Qiuyuan and Su Wen's "Theory of Literary Freedom," and is precisely a variant of those reactionary bourgeois theories. Because they put on the cloak of Marxism to oppose Marxism, they are more difficult to be seen through and have more deceptive power than their predecessors. In this way, they have stubbornly promoted their absurd theory against the advanced worldview for many years, with the aim of lifting the Party's Marxist leadership of literary and artistic work so that their bourgeois idealist literary and artistic thought can occupy this important ideological position.
    Obviously, the essence of the difference between us and Hu Feng and Xue Wei lies in what kind of literature is ultimately wanted? Is it proletarian literature? Or bourgeois literature? The reason why they tried so hard to oppose Marxism and the scientific worldview is to use bourgeois literature to replace proletarian literature. Because the difference between these two kinds of literature is first manifested in the fact that they are based on different ideological positions and different worldviews.
    What method did Xue Wei use to oppose advocating that writers study Marxism and grasp the scientific worldview?
    First, Xue Wei juxtaposed writers' "writing the truth" and grasping the scientific worldview. He said: "I think: 'China currently,' this 'reality,' is especially needed to ask of all writers, to ask them to 'write out the truth.' What Chinese critics ask of Chinese writers should not be 'the worldview should be put in the first place,' but 'writing out the truth' should be put in the first place." ("Collected Past Works," page 73)
    It is not wrong to ask writers to write out the truth. What is wrong is that Xue Wei juxtaposed asking writers to write the truth with asking writers to grasp the scientific worldview. Are writing the truth and the scientific worldview incompatible things? Why must writing the truth exclude the scientific worldview? Is it that writers who have mastered the scientific worldview cannot write the truth, while those who do not have the scientific worldview can write the truth more easily?
    The task of writers is to write the truth, and this is not in dispute. However, the truth will not automatically jump to the tip of the writer's pen; it must rely on the writer to observe and study real life to obtain it. Here, the writer's position and worldview cannot but play a role. For any social event, writers with different positions will have different views. In capitalist countries, workers' strikes are seen as just behavior by working-class writers, while bourgeois writers see them as illegal acts that infringe on capitalists' property and profits. In the eyes of many naturalist writers, the truth of workers' lives is nothing more than alcoholism and quarrels, while they cannot see or are unwilling to see workers' awakening and struggle. In the eyes of Hu Feng and his partners, the "truth" of the Chinese working people is nothing more than "the trauma of spiritual enslavement," at most spontaneous "madness," while they cannot see or are unwilling to see the organized and led struggle of the working people. It can be seen that the truth is not like a seashell that can be picked up at random on the beach. Whether writers can truly understand and reflect objective truth is closely related to their position and worldview.
    Juxtaposing writing the truth and the scientific worldview is one of the main methods used by modern reactionary bourgeois commentators to attack proletarian literature. They are doing their best to denigrate and slander the scientific worldview. They slander proletarian literature, saying that proletarian literature is not true, because proletarian writers always consciously express their tendencies, and in their view, since they want to express the tendencies of a certain social class, then there is no personal authenticity and freedom for writers. Xue Wei's argument is exactly like this. He said: "To write truly good works, the writer must first be a '"true" self.'" This means that the writer cannot write truly good works because he is not a '"true" self,'" in other words, because he is the expression of the thoughts and beliefs of a specific advanced class. Since Xue Wei hates and despises the worldview of the advanced class so much, he naturally stands with the bourgeois commentators.
    Contrary to the slander of bourgeois commentators, proletarian literature is the most true literature. This is not only because the interests of the proletariat are consistent with the truth of life and the laws of social development, but also because proletarian writers have the most advanced scientific worldview, namely Marxism-Leninism, this powerful weapon. This is precisely where proletarian writers are superior to other writers. It is precisely the Marxist worldview that gives writers lofty thoughts and full enthusiasm, helping them to deeply understand reality in struggle, to see the essence of life phenomena, and giving them the ability of artistic generalization, helping them to create typical artistic images for the purpose of educating the people and arming the people. In our literature, truthfulness and ideology are closely combined and inseparable.
    Juxtaposing writing the truth and the scientific worldview is the first method Xue Wei used to guide writers away from the Marxist worldview.
    Secondly, Xue Wei juxtaposed the writer's creative practice and grasping the correct worldview. He said: "Empty shouts of 'correct worldview' are not 'the bright lamp illuminating their way forward.' Writing 'from the practice of reality' is the great road for them to move forward, and the 'prerequisite' for them to truly get the help of this 'bright lamp'!" ("Collected Past Works," page 73)
    Perhaps, what Xue Wei opposes is "empty shouting," not the "correct worldview," right? Then why doesn't Xue Wei earnestly promote the "correct worldview," but uses "writing" to juxtapose it with the "correct worldview"? Obviously, this is because in Xue Wei's view, writers only need to bury themselves in writing. As for the "correct worldview," it is of no use, it should not be promoted to writers, and if anyone promotes it, it is "empty shouting."
    Writers should write, there is no doubt about that. However, writing and grasping the correct worldview are not contradictory things. For a revolutionary writer, studying Marxism, studying life, and engaging in creation are all advancing at the same time and are inseparable. They gradually improve their ideological level and their ability to understand and express life in the process of constantly learning, observing, and working. Should we study Marxism first? Or should we engage in creation first? Asking such a question is as absurd as asking whether a person should lift their left foot or their right foot first when walking. However, although writers should not abandon creation in order to grasp the correct worldview, whether or not they grasp the correct worldview clearly has a decisive significance for a writer's creation. The great Russian writer Saltykov-Shchedrin said: "We believe that the ambiguity of the worldview is a very important shortcoming, which can make the artist's creative activities waste effort." At the Second Congress of Soviet Writers, many old Soviet writers such as Gladkov and Fedin used their personal experience to explain that if today's writers leave the communist ideological position and leave the Marxist-Leninist worldview, it is impossible to write "decent works that are beneficial to the people." The scientific worldview is precisely the bright lamp illuminating the writer's way forward!
    Juxtaposing creative practice and the correct worldview, and mystifying the creative process, saying that it is simply incomprehensible to ordinary people, this is precisely a method used by bourgeois literary theorists to resist the guidance of Marxism in literary and artistic creation. Hu Feng also did this. You say that writers should transform their thinking? Hu Feng said: "Their creative practice is the process of overcoming their own dual personality and pursuing self-transformation in conjunction with the people." ("Hu Feng's Opinions on Literary and Artistic Issues," page 58) You say that writers should study Marxism and grasp the Marxist worldview? Hu Feng said: "Marxism includes realism, and Marxism will be achieved through realism." (Ibid., page 9) In short, in the view of Xue Wei and Hu Feng, creative practice is everything, and all problems can be solved here. However, today's writers, away from the more important process of going deep into practical struggle and studying Marxism and studying society, creative practice can only be a "self-expansion" or "spiritual struggle" that violates reality and is subjective and idealistic. This is absolutely impossible to reach Marxism, but will only reach subjective idealism. Hu Feng and his partners are living examples before our eyes.
    Juxtaposing the writer's creative practice and the correct worldview is the second method Xue Wei used to guide writers away from the Marxist worldview.
    In order to oppose the Marxist worldview, Xue Wei also invented a so-called "life-forms-thought" theory. He said: "Gaining life can also gain thought, and the formation (and shaping) of thought is not unrelated to the experience of real life. Conversely, for an artist, the development of this entire process, my understanding is: thought is formed by life (including the arousal of taste, the practice of taste, education, learning, etc.), and he himself experiences his thought; then he uses the thought he has mastered to observe life, and in the observation together with life, he enriches, develops, strengthens, and even modifies the inner nature of his thought." ("Collected Past Works," page 111)
    According to Xue Wei's statement, the "entire process" by which artists "gain thought" is merely "life." His formula is: thought is formed by life and then the thought formed by life is used to observe life, and in the observation of life, one enriches, develops, and modifies one's own thought. In this way, Xue Wei denies the necessity for writers to study Marxism. This is completely a spontaneous point of view.
    It is true that thought comes from life, that social life is the source of thought, and that writers can understand the truth of life by going deep into life and observing life. However, it cannot be concluded from this that we only need to go to life to "gain thought" and that studying Marxism is irrelevant. Because Marxism is a complete scientific theory and ideological system produced by a few people with profound scientific knowledge who summed up all the advanced thoughts of mankind and scientifically observed and studied the workers' movement and the entire social life in the practice of struggle. People may gain some views in line with Marxism in their own life practice, but not everyone can form Marxism in their own lives. If the working class does not accept socialist consciousness, life will only lead them to form trade unionism. Of course, this is also a kind of thought, but it is not Marxist thought. A person's direct life experience is limited, and we must obtain nourishment and arm ourselves from the existing ideological achievements of mankind, especially from the scientific theory of Marxism. Advocating spontaneity for today's writers will only limit their understanding of the rich and complex modern social life, and even lead them astray. Xue Wei's theory, to use Gorky's analogy, is to lead writers away from Marxism, the highest "intellectual peak," and lead them to the "grass mounds" of the swamp.
    This is the third method Xue Wei used to oppose advocating that writers grasp the Marxist worldview.
    Since Xue Wei hates the Marxist worldview so much, he cannot but oppose the orientation of literature serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Because wholeheartedly serving the working people is the most basic requirement and manifestation of the communist worldview. Of course, he does not openly oppose the orientation of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. He inappropriately emphasizes the role of petty-bourgeois writers in literature and the importance of literary works describing the petty-bourgeoisie, in order to dilute and resist the orientation of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. He does his best to belittle the role of workers, peasants, and soldiers in cultural creation and the reality of their rapid growth in culture, while believing that advocating "writing about workers, peasants, and soldiers in the language of workers, peasants, and soldiers" is the "thought of the 'new national essence school'" ("On the Orientation of Literature for Workers, Peasants and Soldiers," page 150), "To require that the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers be able to understand literary works themselves is even more an empty talk close to cancellation." (Ibid., page 151) It is not surprising that Xue Wei, like Hu Feng, is an opponent of national forms in literature.
    Since Xue Wei hates Marxism so much, and opposes the scientific worldview in every possible way, he will inevitably oppose the ideological transformation of writers. Because the essence of ideological transformation is nothing more than changing the writer's position and worldview, that is, shifting from the ideological position of the petty bourgeoisie or the bourgeoisie to the ideological position of the working class, and this is what Xue Wei does not like.
    If in 1936, Xue Wei was openly opposed to the ideological transformation of writers, comparing the demand for writers to transform their thinking to Hitler's "political actions" of "compelling and coercing with 'power' or torture"; then, by 1948, after the publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," Xue Wei had to appear in a more concealed form in his "On the Orientation of Literature for Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers." Xue Wei talks a lot about the ideological transformation of petty-bourgeois writers here, but, surprisingly, from beginning to end, there is not a single word about writers should study Marxism and should strive to grasp the Marxist worldview; on the contrary, he still uses mocking and contemptuous language to viciously attack the correct worldview, that is, the Marxist worldview, believing that requiring writers to grasp the correct worldview "contains a strong petty-bourgeois speculative point of view," is a "closed-doorist literary theory" that "rejects people thousands of miles away," a "'qualification review' that doesn't fit," and a "book fetishism"; believing that advocating the correct worldview will produce the "evil consequences" that "cause works to fail." May I ask, does this have anything in common with the spirit of Comrade Mao Zedong's repeated teachings that our writers and artists should study Marxism-Leninism?
    How to carry out ideological transformation? Comrade Mao Zedong said: Our literary and artistic workers "must gradually shift their position to the proletariat's side 'in the process of going deep among the workers, peasants and soldiers, going deep into practical struggles, and studying Marxism and studying society.'" This is a new requirement put forward to writers by the new revolutionary era. However, Xue Wei put forward another method of "transformation," believing that the most important thing is to have a "honest attitude" and "emotional 'love'," and so on. Being honest and emotionally loving workers and peasants are all good, but if the writer has not changed his position and has not stood on the side of the proletariat, then everything can only be abstract things without an ideological foundation. Xue Wei deliberately used abstract things to replace the revolutionary ideological position, actually abolishing the ideological transformation of writers.
    Obviously, this is not the literary and artistic thought of the workers, peasants, and soldiers orientation, but the literary and artistic thought of the anti-workers, peasants, and soldiers orientation.
    Since Xue Wei hates Marxism so much and hates the Marxist worldview, he will inevitably find friends on the side of Marxism's enemies. In 1935, our Party put forward the policy of stopping the civil war and uniting to resist Japan, and in the literary and artistic circles, of course, we should unite as widely as possible all writers and artists who are willing to resist Japan together. But this can only be a united front led by proletarian thought, not a surrender to the enemies of proletarian thought. However, Xue Wei advocated a so-called "truly broad" "freedom of creation" that abolished the leadership of proletarian thought. Please see Xue Wei's claim:
    The freedom of writing that is needed now should be more thorough than the attitude of the "third kind of people" in those years.
    We now advocate that all literary writing should be free, and thoroughly eliminate all subjective discrimination against any kind of work. Regardless of whether it is a work writing about "fascism"; a work writing about "nationalism"; a work writing about "loyalty to the monarch and patriotism"; a work writing about "the mass literature of the national revolutionary war"; a work writing about "national defense literature";... as long as someone sincerely wants to write like this, we are unwilling to have a subjective prejudice or contempt against them in advance. (Emphasis added by the author)
    Regardless of all kinds of people and factions, everyone has the right to exist... Here, the formulaic empty command; the clever erasure of false theories; and even the "weapons" such as "dung broom", "conspiracy", and rogue tactics, etc.; are all superfluous. (Above "Collected Past Works", pages 55, 59)
    Look, whether it is "fascist literature" or "nationalist literature" (that is, anti-communist and anti-Soviet literature), they should all be "treated equally," and "as long as someone sincerely wants to write like this," they should not be "discriminated or despised," that is, they should not be fought against. Here, Xue Wei stood on the position of apologist for reactionary literature and art. If Xue Wei still wants to quibble about everything said before, this fox tail can't be covered up anyway. Here, it is exposed what kind of "literature" Xue Wei and his followers need and support.
    But, isn't "fascist literature" and "nationalist literature" protected by the bayonets of the Kuomintang reactionaries? What are they not free to do? It turned out that what Xue Wei thought hindered their "freedom" were the left-wing writers and artists at that time, because the left-wing writers and artists exposed and fought against these reactionary literatures. In this way, it is very clear for whom Xue Wei is fighting for "freedom" and to whom he is fighting for "freedom." He used all kinds of vicious words to curse the struggle of the left-wing writers and artists at that time against reactionary literature and art, saying that it was "formulaic empty command," "the clever erasure of false theories," and even "dung broom," "conspiracy," "rogue tactics," and so on. Indeed, his attitude of hostility towards left-wing literature and art is much more "thorough" and much more blatant than the "third kind of people" in those years. We know how resolutely Mr. Lu Xun fought against "nationalist literature" and the "theory of literary freedom" of the "third kind of people," and so on. Xue Wei and Hu Feng, who often shamelessly claim to be Lu Xun's disciples, are opposed to Lu Xun's thought on almost all important issues, and they are actually traitors to Lu Xun.
    Our literature is "a literature openly linked to the proletariat" (Lenin), and it is part of the proletariat's overall cause. This is truly free literature, because proletarian writers create according to the truth they know, not according to the likes and dislikes of capitalists; this is truly free literature, because proletarian writers have mastered the most advanced scientific worldview, which enables them to get rid of all prejudices or illusions and correctly and deeply understand the essence of reality, and freedom is nothing more than the understanding of necessity. As for the "freedom of creation" shouted by bourgeois writers and artists, it is nothing more than a mask to cover up their reactionary essence of serving the bourgeoisie. We must expose this hypocrisy and tear up this mask.
    The above are the most fundamental errors in Xue Wei's literary and artistic thought. The errors in many other issues that come from this fundamental error will not be discussed here.
    It can be seen that Xue Wei and Hu Feng's literary and artistic thoughts are completely consistent on basic issues. They oppose the Marxist worldview, oppose the Party spirit of literature, advocate the lack of ideology in literature, oppose the ideological transformation of writers, advocate bourgeois liberalism, oppose the Party's leadership of literary and artistic work, and demand that the anti-Party sectarian group be given legal rights,... The fundamental purpose of all this is to make our literature separate from the cause of the proletariat, separate from the cause of socialism, and become a tool serving the bourgeoisie. It is no wonder that Xue Wei regards proletarian writers who advocate the Marxist worldview as "fanatics" and as his "great enemies" ("Collected Past Works," small introduction, written in 1947).
    Distinguishing right from wrong and distinguishing between enemies and friends is the most fundamental task of our ideological struggle this time.

    雪苇——胡风的追随者
  　林默涵
    近几个月来，学术界和文艺界对胡风的文艺思想展开了全面的批判，揭露了胡风思想的反党、反人民、反社会主义的实质。可以看出，这种思想的产生是有一定的社会基础的，是反动的资产阶级思想在文艺领域的反映，因此，在文艺界有一些附和胡风思想或者跟胡风思想相同的人，这决不是奇怪的事情。所以，对胡风及其一派的思想进行彻底的批判，是十分必要的工作。
    雪苇就是长期地忠实追随胡风的人们中间的一个，他的文艺思想基本上是和胡风一致的。
    雪苇在最近几年出版了四本书。其中特别值得注意的，是他的“过去集”和“论文学的工农兵方向”。“过去集”是一九四八年在大连出版的，后来又改名“两间集”、“论文一集”，一再重版，可见作者对它的重视。其中的部分文章虽然是在一九三六年写的，但作者在书前“小引”中特别声明，他的见解并没有什么改变，那些理论“仍未过时”，并且认为“给现在的青年朋友们看了”，还是有“益处”的。“论文学的工农兵方向”则是一九四八年写的。
    在这些“仍未过时”的有“益处”的著作里，人们可以看到，雪苇是用了许多美丽的字眼来赞美胡风的文艺思想的。他颂扬胡风的论文集“文艺笔谈”是“辉煌的理论”，是“新的理论的开篇”，而且还具有“原则意义上的伟大”（重点原有）。他说：为鲁迅所开创、由瞿秋白和冯雪峰建设起来的现实主义理论传统，“仅仅”在胡风的“文艺笔谈”里“得到一脉相承”。和这种赞美并行，雪苇和胡风一样，也是用了十分恶毒的字眼来咒骂马克思主义和科学的世界观。
    雪苇反对科学的世界观，是在一九三六年就开始的，后来一直坚持这种意见。我们知道，一九三六年前后，在上海的左翼文艺界发生了论争，在这次论争中，一方面表现了团结广大作家艺术家投身入当时抗日民族自卫斗争的神圣要求，另一方面也暴露了左翼文艺界长期没有得到正确克服的教条主义、宗派主义的错误。但是，产生这些错误的主要原因，则正如毛泽东同志所指出，是由于当时的文艺界没有解决为工农兵服务这样一个根本的问题，革命的文艺家没有真正站到工人阶级的立场上来，他们之间还缺乏共同的明确的奋斗目标。所以，许多争论、分歧是发生在一些比较次要的甚至是无原则的问题上。可是，雪苇和胡风等人却在反教条主义、反宗派主义的幌子下，乘机对马克思主义理论和马克思主义世界观进行了恶毒的攻击和诬蔑。按照他们的荒谬说法，文艺工作中的缺点或错误的根源，不是由于文艺工作者缺乏正确的立场观点，相反的，是因为有人向作家们提倡了学习马克思主义和掌握科学的世界观。他们认为，对文艺唯一需要的，是他们的所谓“真实”和“自由”。很明显，这是一种仇视马克思主义的理论，这正是和梁实秋的“人性论”，胡秋原、苏汶的“文艺自由论”
  “一脉相承”，正是那些反动的资产阶级理论的一个变种。因为他们披上马克思主义外衣来反对马克思主义，所以，比他们的前辈更不容易被人识破，更有迷惑人的力量。就这样，他们多年来顽强地宣传他们反对先进世界观的荒谬理论，目的就是要解除党对于文艺工作的马克思主义的领导，以便让他们的资产阶级唯心主义的文艺思想来占领这一个重要的思想阵地。
    很明显，我们和胡风、雪苇之间的分歧的实质，是在于究竟要什么样的文学？是要无产阶级的文学呢？还是要资产阶级的文学？他们所以竭力反对马克思主义和科学的世界观，其目的就是要用资产阶级文学来偷换无产阶级的文学。因为这两种文学的区别，正是首先表现在它们是以不同的思想立场和不同的世界观为基础的。
    雪苇是用什么方法来反对提倡作家学习马克思主义，反对提倡作家掌握科学的世界观呢？
    首先，雪苇把作家“写真实”和掌握科学的世界观对立起来。他说：“我以为：‘中国目前’这‘现实’，是尤其需要向一切的作家要求，要求他们去‘写出真实来’的。中国的批评家向中国作家的要求，不是‘应当把世界观放在第一位’，而是应当把‘写出真实来’放在第一位的。”（“过去集”七三页）
    要求作家写出真实来，这是没有错的。错误的是雪苇把要求作家写真实跟要求作家掌握科学的世界观对立起来。难道写真实和科学的世界观是不能相容的东西吗？为什么写真实就必须排斥科学的世界观呢？难道作家掌握了科学的世界观，反而不能写真实，而没有科学的世界观，倒是更能写出真实来吗？
    作家的任务是写真实，这是没有争论的。但是，真实不会自动跑到作家的笔尖下面来，那是要依靠作家去观察和研究现实生活才能获得的，在这里，作家的立场和世界观就不能不发生作用。对于任何社会事件，不同立场的作家就会有不同的看法。资本主义国家里的工人罢工，在工人阶级作家看来是正义的行为，在资产阶级作家看来是侵害资本家的财产和利润的非法行为。在许多自然主义作家看来，工人生活的真实不外是酗酒和争吵，至于工人的觉悟和斗争，他们是看不到或者不愿意看到的。在胡风和他的伙伴们看来，中国劳动人民的
  “真实”，无非是“精神奴役的创伤”，至多是自发的“疯狂性”，至于劳动人民的有组织有领导的斗争，他们是看不到或者不愿意看到的。可见，真实并不是像海滩上的随便可以捡到的贝壳。作家能否真正认识和反映客观的真实，跟他们的立场、世界观是密切相关的。
    把写真实和科学的世界观对立起来，正是现代反动资产阶级论客们用来攻击无产阶级文学的主要方法之一。他们是竭力诋毁和诽谤科学的世界观的。他们诬蔑无产阶级文学，说无产阶级文学是不真实的，因为无产阶级作家总是自觉地表现他的倾向性的，而在他们看来，既然要表现一定社会阶级的倾向性，那就没有作家个人的真实性和自由了。雪苇的论调，正是如此。他说：“要写得出真实的作品，首先就要作家做个‘真实’的自己的人。”这就是说，作家写不出真实的作品，是因为他不是
  “‘真实’的自己的人”，换句话说，就因为他是特定的先进阶级的思想和信念的表现者。雪苇既然那么仇视、憎恨先进阶级的世界观，他就自然和资产阶级论客站在一道了。
    和资产阶级论客的诽谤相反，无产阶级文学是最真实的文学。这不但因为无产阶级的利益是和生活真实、和社会发展的规律没有矛盾而相吻合的，还因为无产阶级的作家具有最先进的科学的世界观、即马克思列宁主义这个强大的武器。这正是无产阶级作家优越于其他作家的地方。正是马克思主义世界观，给了作家以崇高的思想和饱满的热情，帮助他们在斗争中深刻地认识现实、洞察生活现象的本质，并且给他们以艺术概括的本领，帮助他们创造出典型的艺术形象，用以教育人民、武装人民。在我们的文学中，真实性和思想性是密切结合而不可分割的。
    把写真实和科学的世界观对立起来，这是雪苇用来引导作家离开马克思主义世界观的第一个方法。
    其次，雪苇把作家的创作实践和掌握正确的世界观对立起来。他说：“空洞的高喊‘正确的世界观’并不‘是照耀他们前进的明灯’，要‘从现实的实践出发’去写作才是他们前进的大道，使他们真正得到这‘明灯’底帮助的‘前提’！”（“过去集”七三页）
    也许，雪苇反对的是“空洞的叫喊”，而不是“正确的世界观”吧？那末，雪苇为什么不来切切实实地提倡“正确的世界观”，却用“写作”来和
  “正确的世界观”对立起来呢？很明显，这是因为在雪苇看来，作家只要埋头写作就行。至于“正确的世界观”，那是没有什么用处的，是不应该向作家提倡的，如果谁提倡了，那就是“空洞的叫喊”。
    作家应当写作，这是没有疑问的。但是，写作和掌握正确的世界观并不是矛盾的事情。对于一个革命的作家，学习马克思主义、研究生活、进行创作，是同时并进，不可分割的。他们就在这不断地学习、观察和劳作的过程中，逐渐提高自己的思想水平，提高自己的认识生活和表现生活的能力。先学好马克思主义呢？还是先进行创作呢？提出这样的问题，等于问一个人走路应该先举左脚还是先举右脚一样荒谬。但是，作家固然不应该为了掌握正确的世界观而抛弃创作，而掌握正确的世界观与否，对于一个作家的创作，却显然有着决定性的意义。俄罗斯伟大作家萨尔蒂可夫—谢德林说：“我们认为世界观的不明确，是非常重要的缺点，它可以使艺术家的创作活动罔费心血。”在苏联第二次作家代表大会上，苏联许多老作家如革拉特珂夫、费定等等，就用他们的亲身经验，说明了今天的作家如果离开共产主义的思想立场，离开马克思列宁主义世界观，是不可能写出“像样的、对人民有益的作品”来的。科学的世界观正是照耀作家前进的明灯！
    把创作实践和正确的世界观对立起来，并且把创作过程神秘化，把它说得简直非常人所能理解，这正是资产阶级文艺理论家用来抵制马克思主义对于文艺创作的指导的一种方法。胡风也就是这样做的。你说作家应该改造思想吗？胡风说：“他们的创作实践就是克服着本身的二重人格，追求着和人民结合的自我改造的过程。”（“胡风对文艺问题的意见”五八页）你说作家应该学习马克思主义、掌握马克思主义世界观吗？胡风说：“马克思主义包括了现实主义，通过现实主义就会达到马克思主义的。”（同上九页）总之，在雪苇和胡风他们看来，创作实践就是一切，一切问题都可以在这里解决。但是，今天的作家离开了更重要的深入实际斗争和学习马克思主义学习社会的过程，创作实践就只能是违反现实的、主观主义的“自我扩张”或
  “精神搏斗”罢了。这是绝对达不到马克思主义，而只会达到主观唯心主义的。胡风和他的伙伴们，就是摆在眼前的活例证。
    把作家的创作实践和正确的世界观对立起来，这是雪苇用来引导作家离开马克思主义世界观的第二个方法。
    为了反对马克思主义的世界观，雪苇又发明了一种所谓“生活形成思想”论。他说：“获得生活同时也能获得思想，思想的形成（及成形）和实生活的体验不是毫无关系的。反之，对于一个艺术家，这个全过程的发展，我得到的理解倒是：由生活
  （包括趣味的被引起、趣味的实践、教养、学习等等）形成思想，并自身体验其思想；再即以所掌握的思想去观察生活，而在与生活一起的观察中，更丰富、发展、强化以至修正他思想的内在。”（“过去集”一一一页）
    按照雪苇的说法，艺术家“获得思想”的“全过程”，仅仅是“生活”而已，他的公式是：由生活形成思想又用由生活形成的思想去观察生活，在观察生活中丰富、发展和修正自己的思想。这样，雪苇就否认了作家有学习马克思主义的必要。这完全是自发论的观点。
    不错，思想是从生活中来的，社会生活是思想的泉源，作家能够在深入生活、观察生活中认识生活的真理。但是，决不能由此得出结论说，我们只要到生活中去“获得思想”就行，而学习马克思主义是无关紧要的。因为马克思主义是少数具有深湛的科学知识的人物总结了人类的全部先进思想，并在斗争实践中科学地观察、研究了工人运动和全部社会生活而产生出来的、完整的科学理论和思想体系。人们在自己的生活实践中可能获得某些符合马克思主义的观点，但决不是每一个人都能够在自己的生活中形成马克思主义。工人阶级如果不接受社会主义意识，生活只会使他们形成工联主义。当然，这也是一种思想，但不是马克思主义思想。一个人的直接生活经验是有限的，我们必须从人类已有的思想成果中、特别是从马克思主义的科学理论中去获得滋养和武装。对于今天的作家提倡自发论，只会限制他们对于丰富复杂的现代社会生活的认识，甚至于使他们迷失方向，走入歧途。雪苇这种理论，用高尔基的比喻来说，就是要作家离开马克思主义这样一座最高的“理智高峰”，而把他们引导到沼泽的“草墩”上去。
    这就是雪苇反对提倡作家掌握马克思主义世界观的第三个方法。
    雪苇既然这样仇视马克思主义的世界观，他就不能不反对文艺为工农兵服务的方向。因为全心全意为劳动人民服务，正是共产主义世界观最基本的要求和表现。他当然不是公开反对工农兵方向的。他不适当地强调小资产阶级作家在文学上的作用及描写小资产阶级的文学作品的重要，以冲淡和对抗工农兵的方向。他竭力贬低工农兵在文化创造上的作用和在文化上迅速成长的现实情况，而认为提倡“用工农兵的话写工农兵”是“‘新国粹派’的思想”（“论文学的工农兵方向”一五○页），“对文学作品要要求工农兵群众自己能看懂，这更是迹近取消的空谈”。（同前，一五一页）雪苇和胡风一样，是文学上的民族形式的反对者，这就并不奇怪了。
    雪苇既然这样仇视马克思主义，这样千方百计地反对科学的世界观，他就当然也要反对作家的思想改造。因为思想改造的实质，无非是改变作家的立场和世界观，即从小资产阶级或资产阶级的思想立场转移到工人阶级的思想立场上来，而这是雪苇所不喜欢的。
    如果在一九三六年，雪苇是公开反对作家思想改造，他把要求作家改造思想比喻为希特勒“用‘威力’或苦刑来强逼胁迫的”“政治行动”；那末，到了一九四八年，在毛泽东同志的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表以后，雪苇在他的“论文学的工农兵方向”中，就不能不以比较隐蔽的形式出现了。雪苇在这里大谈小资产阶级作家的思想改造问题，可是，令人奇怪的是，从头到尾，竟没有半句话说到作家应该学习马克思主义，应该努力掌握马克思主义世界观；相反地，却仍然用讥嘲轻蔑的口吻对正确的世界观、也就是马克思主义的世界观作了恶毒的攻击，认为要求作家掌握正确的世界观是“包含着浓厚的小资产阶级底投机性的观点”，是“拒人于千里之外”的“关门主义的文学理论”、“牛头对不上马嘴的‘资格审查’”，是“书本拜物教”；认为提倡正确的世界观就要产生“使作品归于失败”的“恶果”。试问，这和毛泽东同志再三教诲我们的作家艺术家应该学习马克思列宁主义的精神有任何相同之处吗？
    怎样进行思想改造呢？毛泽东同志说：我们的文艺工作者“一定要在深入工农兵群众、深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马克思主义和学习社会的过程中”，逐渐地把立场移到无产阶级这方面来。这是新的革命的时代提到作家面前来的新的要求。但是，雪苇却提出了另一种“改造”的方法，他认为最要紧的，是要有“老老实实的态度”和“感情上的‘爱’”等等。老老实实、感情上爱工农，这些都是好的，可是，如果作家没有改变立场，没有站到无产阶级这方面来，那一切就只能是抽象的没有思想基础的东西。雪苇故意用抽象的东西来代替革命的思想立场，实际上是取消了作家的思想改造。
    显然地，这不是工农兵方向的文艺思想，而是反工农兵方向的文艺思想。
    雪苇既然这样厌恶马克思主义，厌恶马克思主义的世界观，他就必然会在马克思主义的敌人方面找到朋友。一九三五年，我们的党提出了停止内战、联合抗日的方针，在文艺界当然也应该尽可能广泛地团结一切愿意抗日的作家艺术家共同抗日。但这只能是以无产阶级思想为领导的统一战线，而不是向无产阶级思想的敌人投降。可是，雪苇却主张一种取消无产阶级思想领导的所谓“真正宽大”的“创作自由”。请看雪苇的主张：
    现在所需要的写作自由，应比当年“第三种人”的态度还要彻底。
    我们现在则主张一切文学的写作都应自由，彻底排除一切对于任何一种作品的主观歧视的态度。不管对于写作“法西斯主义”的作品也好；写作“民族主义”的作品也好；写作“忠君爱国”的作品也好；写作“民族革命战争的大众文学”的作品也好；写作“国防文学”的作品也好；……只要有人真心的要这么写，我们对之都不愿相互在主观上先抱一种歧视或鄙视的成见。（重点引者所加）
    不管各种各样的人物和派别，大家都有存在的权利……这里，公式主义的空洞命令；虚伪理论的巧妙抹杀；以至那种“粪帚”、“阴谋”的流氓手腕等等“武器”；都是多余的。（以上“过去集”五五、五九页）
    看呵，不论对“法西斯主义”文学、“民族主义”文学（即反共反苏的文学），都应该“一视同仁”，“只要有人真心要这么写”，都不应该加以“歧视或鄙视”，也就是不应该对它们进行斗争。在这里，雪苇就站到反动文艺辩护士的立场上去了。如果对前面所说的一切，雪苇还想辩解的话，这条狐狸尾巴是怎么也遮盖不住的。这里，就暴露了雪苇他们所需要的、所拥护的究竟是什么“文学”。
    可是，“法西斯主义文学”、“民族主义文学”，不是有国民党反动派的刺刀保护着吗？它们有什么不自由呢？原来雪苇认为妨碍了它们的“自由”的，是当时的左翼文艺家，因为左翼文艺家对这些反动文学进行了揭露和斗争。这样，雪苇究竟是为谁争“自由”，向谁争“自由”，就很明白了。他用尽了一切恶毒的字眼，来咒骂当时左翼文艺家对反动文艺的斗争，说那是“公式主义的空洞命令”，
  “虚伪理论的巧妙抹杀”，甚至是“粪帚”、“阴谋”、“流氓手腕”等等。的确，他的敌视左翼文艺的态度，是比当年“第三种人”“还要彻底”得多，露骨得多的。我们知道，鲁迅先生怎样坚决地和“民族主义文学”、和“第三种人”的“文艺自由论”等等进行过斗争。常常大言不惭地以鲁迅的门徒自居的雪苇、胡风们，几乎在一切重要问题上都是和鲁迅的思想相对立的，他们实际上是鲁迅的叛徒。
    我们的文学是“和无产阶级公开联系着的文学”（列宁），它是无产阶级总的事业的一部分。这是真正自由的文学，因为无产阶级作家是依据他们所认识的真理来进行创作，而不是根据资本家的好恶来进行创作的；这是真正自由的文学，因为无产阶级作家掌握了最先进的科学的世界观，这就使他们能够摆脱一切偏见或错觉，正确地深刻地认识现实的本质，而自由无非是对于必然性的认识。至于资产阶级的文艺家们所叫喊的“创作自由”，则不过是一种假面具，用来掩盖他们为资产阶级效劳的反动实质的。我们必须揭露这种伪善，撕破这个假面具。
    以上，是雪苇文艺思想中的最根本的错误。由这根本错误而来的在其他许多问题上的错误，这里就不谈了。
    可以看到，雪苇和胡风的文艺思想，在基本问题上是完全一致的。他们反对马克思主义的世界观，反对文学的党性，鼓吹文学的无思想性，反对作家的思想改造，提倡资产阶级的自由主义，反对党对于文艺工作的领导，要求给反党的宗派集团以合法的权利，……这一切的根本目的，就是要使我们的文学脱离无产阶级的事业，脱离社会主义的事业，而变成为资产阶级服务的工具。这就难怪雪苇要把提倡马克思主义世界观的无产阶级作家看为“疯狂家”，看为他的“大敌”了（“过去集”小引，一九四七年作）。
    明辨是非，分清敌友，正是我们这次思想斗争的最根本的任务。
