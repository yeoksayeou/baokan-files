Xinhua News Agency, April 15th. After more than ninety days of talks, the delegation of the China Fisheries Association and the delegation of the Japan-China Fisheries Council signed an agreement on fisheries in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea in Beijing on April 15 (see page 2 of today's newspaper). Yang Yu, head of the delegation of the China Fisheries Association, Gao Shuyi, deputy head, Zhao Anbo, advisor, and all members of the delegation signed on behalf of the China Fisheries Association. Shichida Suekichi, head of the delegation of the Japan-China Fisheries Council, Murayama Satarō, deputy head, Yamazaki Kininosuke, and all members of the delegation signed on behalf of the Japan-China Fisheries Council. After the signing, both parties exchanged letters and memoranda.
    Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, Li Dequan, President of the Red Cross Society of China, and Wu Yunfu, Secretary-General of the China People's Relief Association, attended the signing ceremony.
    Japanese people in Beijing, such as Kameda Togo, also attended the signing ceremony.
    Due to the destruction by Japanese militarists and the devastation of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule in the past, China's fisheries industry has been in a backward state for a long time. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, China's fisheries have made considerable progress. However, due to the lack of normal relations between Japan and China, fishery disputes frequently occur in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea. Therefore, resolving the Sino-Japanese fishery issue is a common demand of the fishery circles of both countries.
    According to the proposal of Premier Zhou Enlai of China in October 1954 when receiving the Japanese Diet Members Delegation and the Japanese Academic and Cultural Visiting Delegation to China regarding the settlement of fishery issues, non-governmental fishery organizations of China and Japan held talks and reached an agreement. This is in line with the desire of the Chinese and Japanese people to live together in friendship.
    The scope of the agreement does not include the military alert zone near the Bohai Sea, the military restricted navigation zone near the Zhoushan Islands, and the military operation zone south of 29 degrees north latitude for the liberation of Taiwan, as stipulated by our government. At the same time, the agreement does not include the "motorized trawling fishing ban zone" established by our government to protect fishery resources. The establishment of this "motorized trawling fishing ban zone" is not only in the interests of China's fishery industry and the vast number of coastal fishermen, but also beneficial to the Japanese fishery industry. Through the exchange of letters, both parties have reached an understanding that Japanese fishing vessels will not enter the above-mentioned areas for operation.
    Based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, the non-governmental fishery delegations of China and Japan, in order to rationally utilize fishing grounds and avoid fishery disputes, divided the fishing grounds in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea into six fishing zones, and stipulated the number of fishing vessels for both parties according to the peak fishing season respectively. The delegations of both parties also exchanged memoranda on fishing grounds that both parties considered likely to be competitive and reached an understanding. The agreement also stipulates the rules to be followed by both parties when fishing.
    The agreement also stipulates the methods for mutual assistance when fishing vessels of both parties berth in each other's ports due to emergencies and mutual assistance after encountering maritime disasters, as well as the methods for exchanging information and technology on fishery resource surveys and research. All these provisions embody the spirit of friendly cooperation and mutual assistance between the fishery circles of China and Japan, and provide favorable conditions for the development of fisheries in both countries.
    In view of the fact that the agreement reached by the non-governmental fishery organizations of the two countries is of a temporary and limited nature, the China Fisheries Association and the Japan-China Fisheries Council have expressed in the agreement their willingness to make efforts to urge their respective governments to promptly hold fishery negotiations between the two governments of China and Japan.

    中日渔业团体签订关于黄海东海渔业协定
    新华社十五日讯　中国渔业协会代表团和日本日中渔业协议会代表团在进行九十多天的会谈后，于四月十五日在北京签订了关于黄海东海渔业的协定（见今日本报第二版）。代表中国渔业协会签字的是中国渔业协会代表团团长杨煜，副团长高树颐，顾问赵安博和全体代表。代表日本日中渔业协议会签字的是日本日中渔业协议会代表团团长七田末吉，副团长村山佐太郎、山崎喜之助和全体代表。在签字后，双方交换了信件和备忘录。
    中国人民外交学会会长张奚若、中国红十字会总会会长李德全和中国人民救济总会秘书长伍云甫等都参加了签字仪式。
    现在北京的日本人士龟田东伍等也参加了签字仪式。
    我国的水产事业由于过去受到日本军国主义者的破坏和蒋介石反动统治的摧残，在长时期内处于落后的状态。自从中华人民共和国成立以后，我国渔业有相当的发展。但是由于日本和我国尚未建立正常关系，在黄海、东海经常发生渔业纠纷。因此，解决中日渔业问题，是中日两国渔业界的共同要求。
    根据我国周恩来总理一九五四年十月在接见日本国会议员访华团和日本学术文化访问代表团时关于解决渔业问题的倡议，中日两国民间渔业团体进行了会谈，并达成了协议。这是符合我国人民和日本人民友好相处的愿望的。
    协定的适用范围不包括我国政府所规定的渤海附近军事警戒区、舟山群岛附近的军事禁航区和北纬二十九度以南为了解放台湾的军事作战区。协定同时也不包括我国政府为了保护渔业资源而设置的
  “机轮拖网渔业禁渔区”，这个“机轮拖网渔业禁渔区”的设置不仅为了我国渔业界和沿海广大渔民的利益，同时对日本渔业界也是有利的。经过交换信件，双方已达成谅解，日本渔轮不进入上述区域作业。
    中日双方民间渔业代表团根据平等互利的原则，为了合理利用渔场，避免渔业纠纷，在黄海、东海的渔场上划分六个渔区，分别按照盛渔期，规定了双方捕鱼的船数。对双方认为可能发生竞争的渔场也经过双方代表团交换备忘录而取得了谅解。协定还规定了双方在捕鱼时应遵守的规则。
    对于双方渔轮因紧急事故寄泊对方海港和遭遇海难后相互救助的办法，以及交换有关渔业资源调查研究的资料和技术交流的办法，协定也作了规定。所有这一切规定都体现了中日两国渔业界友好合作和互助的精神，对于中日两国渔业的发展，提供了有利的条件。
    鉴于两国民间渔业团体所达成的协定，是临时性质的，和带有局限性的，中国渔业协会和日本日中渔业协议会在协定中表示愿意各自为促请本国政府迅速举行中日两国政府之间的渔业谈判而努力。
