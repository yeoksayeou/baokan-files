Party Congress is the Foundation of Intra-Party Democracy
Bai Zhong

The Party Constitution stipulates that the Party Congress and the General Membership Meeting are the highest leading organs of Party organizations at all levels. They have the power to review and approve the work reports of Party committees, discuss and decide on major issues of the Party, and elect Party leadership organs at all levels – the Party committees at all levels. This shows that the Party Congress system is the foundation for promoting intra-Party democracy and carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and an important guarantee for implementing the Party's democratic centralism and the principle of collective leadership. If Party organizations at all levels can regularly convene Party Congresses, conscientiously review the work reports of the Party committees and elect new committees at the Party Congress, they can better pool the experience and wisdom of Party members and the masses to supplement the shortcomings of the Party committees' experience, make the Party's resolutions more perfect and correct; they can make the Party committee's collective leadership more sound, strengthen the Party committee's sense of responsibility to the Party members and the masses, and strengthen its ties with the Party members and the masses; and it can greatly enhance the sense of ownership of Party members and the masses, improve their initiative and enthusiasm in participating in the Party's leadership work and implementing the Party's resolutions and doing the Party's various tasks well; at the same time, it is also of great significance to the development of intra-Party democratic life.

After the Fourth Plenary Session, intra-Party democratic life has been further developed, and Party organizations in many places have attached importance to convening Party Congresses. In 1954, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai and other provinces convened provincial Party Congresses, Tianjin, Wuhan, Xi'an and other twenty cities convened municipal Party Congresses, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Hebei, Rehe and other ten provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region convened county Party Congresses in one hundred and ninety-seven counties, and thirty-two urban districts and other twenty-three units convened Party Congresses; in addition, some places have already formulated plans for convening Party Congresses. The Party Congresses convened in various places have played a great role in implementing the Party's general line and the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session. This is a good phenomenon.

However, from a national perspective, in the past few years, although most of the Party organizations at the county level and above have convened Party representative meetings, most of them have not convened Party Congresses. This situation is detrimental to promoting intra-Party democracy and improving the Party's work.

Many Party organizations have not convened Party Congresses on time. While there are some objective reasons, the fact that Party organizations in some places do not pay enough attention to the convening of Party Congresses is also a very important reason. For example, some people believe that "work is busy, there is no time to convene a Party Congress," or that "the Party Congress cannot solve current work problems, and the preparatory work is very troublesome, so it is better to hold a cadre meeting, which is easier." Obviously, this understanding is wrong. The experience of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Shanxi and other provinces in universally convening Party Congresses at all levels above the county level from 1954 to the present proves that convening Party Congresses has played a major role in improving leadership and educating cadres, so it not only does not hinder current work, but also greatly promotes the current work, especially the central work. The Party Congress of Heshun County, Shanxi Province, is one such example. The Heshun County Party Committee convened the Third Party Congress on January 12, 1955. In addition to listening to the work report of the County Party Committee, electing a new County Party Committee and representatives to the Provincial Party Congress, the meeting focused on discussing the work of unified purchase and marketing, mutual assistance and cooperation, spring farming production, and conscription and replenishment of soldiers, and passed resolutions. The County Party Committee made a full self-criticism in its work report, and the Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee made a special report to the Congress on the main shortcomings of the County Party Committee's leadership in the unified purchase and marketing and mutual assistance and cooperation movements in the past year. Under the inspiration and support of the County Party Committee, the Congress launched criticism from the bottom up. More than 200 representatives and attendees (accounting for 80% of the attendees) expressed their opinions and put forward many criticisms of the leadership shortcomings of the County Party Committee. For example, some representatives said: "It is wrong for district and township cadres to write false reports, but the County Party Committee should also be responsible, because the County Party Committee set the production plan too high, which is not practical. If the task is not completed, it will be criticized, so some cadres write false reports in order to cope with the superiors." During the election of the County Committee, the Congress raised criticisms and opinions on each candidate, and some candidates made public self-criticisms of their shortcomings. Like this, on the basis of fully promoting democracy, discussing and deciding on major issues in future work, especially current work, will make these decisions more practical, make everyone's understanding clearer, and increase everyone's confidence in completing these tasks; at the same time, because the Congress focused on examining the shortcomings of the County Party Committee's leadership, and elected a new County Party Committee on this basis, this is a great education and improvement for the leading cadres and all the comrades present. The positive role played by this education and improvement in future work is immeasurable. It can be seen from this that the role of the Party Congress cannot be replaced by any cadre meeting.

At present, the Party's organization has developed greatly nationwide, and various tasks have gradually gotten on track. Under this situation, it is more necessary and possible for Party organizations at all levels to convene Party Congresses on time, so as to better exert the enthusiasm of all Party members, improve the Party's leadership level, and guarantee the smooth completion of the socialist construction cause.

Of course, it is not enough to just convene Party Congresses on time, it is also necessary to hold Party Congresses well. Holding Party Congresses well depends on many conditions, but one of the most important conditions is to fully promote democracy. The key to promoting democracy lies in whether the leading personnel of the Party Committee have the courage to self-criticize and the spirit of humbly accepting criticism from Party members and the masses. The experiences and lessons of Party organizations in many regions in convening Party Congresses have proved this point. In this regard, the problem that deserves attention at present is that some Party Congresses have not focused on checking the work and carrying out criticism and self-criticism on the leadership of the Party Committee, but have instead checked and criticized the shortcomings of lower-level Party organizations and Party members too much. For example, the work reports of some Party Committees often talk a lot about work achievements and estimate them very highly; they are unwilling to expose shortcomings and mistakes, or they simply and vaguely downplay them in a few words. Because some leading cadres of the Party Committee lack the spirit of self-criticism, they do not actively inspire and support criticism from the bottom up. They either passively deal with the criticisms and opinions of Party members and the masses, or ignore them, or restrict and attack them overtly or covertly. Such a situation occurred in the Party organization of the Fushun City Machine Repair Factory during a Party Committee re-election meeting. Some representatives exposed many shortcomings and errors in the work of the Party Committee member and Chairman of the Labor Union and the Labor Union. The Presidium of the Congress believed that it was "too excessive and weakened the prestige of the Labor Union," fearing that the development of criticism would prevent the Chairman of the Labor Union from being re-elected as a member of the Party Committee. Therefore, they immediately convened a meeting of the group leaders of the representatives to "reverse" the situation and made "explanations" to the speakers; in fact, this was a disguised suppression of criticism. Some leading cadres of Party organizations lack the spirit of humbly accepting criticism, so they often focus on checking the work of lower-level Party committees and lower-level cadres, and call on everyone to make self-criticisms. Some Party Congresses even spent 50% of the time mobilizing representatives to conduct personal self-criticisms and check the shortcomings of grassroots Party organizations. This view and practice are not in line with the functions and powers of the Congress stipulated in the Party Constitution. This shows that some comrades do not understand or do not deeply understand the significance of the Party Congress focusing on checking the leadership of the Party Committee and carrying out criticism from the bottom up. Comrade Liu Shaoqi wrote in the book "On the Party": "The leading organs and responsible persons of the Party at all levels should regularly report their work to the Party members and lower-level organizations who elected them. In this report, not only should the current situation and work achievements be mentioned, but also the shortcomings and weaknesses and errors in the work should be mentioned, and the electors and lower-level organizations should be asked to put forward opinions and criticisms. Experience has proved that many errors and shortcomings that occur in the work of lower-level organizations and Party member cadres cannot be borne by lower-level organizations and Party members and cadres, but should be borne by higher-level leading organs..." He also wrote that wherever the responsible person can seriously and sincerely conduct self-criticism, criticism and self-criticism will develop, the work enthusiasm of Party members will be improved, the work will be improved, and the unity will be strengthened, and the belief of the responsible person will not only not be lost, but will be improved. Of course, criticisms should also be made of the general shortcomings and errors in the work of lower-level Party organizations and Party member cadres, but this is not the main task of the Party Congress. At the same time, as long as the leading cadres can conduct serious self-criticism at the Party Congress, can inspire and educate lower-level cadres to conduct self-criticism, and humbly accept criticism, they will naturally make lower-level cadres consciously conduct self-criticism. After the Party Congresses were convened in Mengjin and other counties in Henan, many district and township cadres went back and automatically held meetings to review their work styles of monopolizing and ordering in the work. They said, "The County Party Secretary made a self-criticism at the Congress, so how can we not review our shortcomings?" The masses reflected that "After the county held the meeting this time, the work style of the cadres has changed."

Another issue that deserves attention in promoting democracy at the Party Congress is that many places have not given due attention to the work of electing Party committees. For example, the time for the election is too short, necessary introductions, discussions, and criticisms of candidates are not made, requests from representatives to replace candidates and newly proposed candidates are not submitted to the Congress for discussion and voting, and correct opinions from representatives are not valued and adopted. It is often emphasized that the candidates proposed by the leadership have been "approved by the higher authorities" and cannot be changed. Such a deviation occurred in the Second Party Congress of Zhongyang County, Shanxi Province, when electing the new County Committee. Two of the County Committee candidates had relatively serious shortcomings and problems. Most of the representatives requested that the two candidates be replaced, but the Presidium emphasized that the list had been reviewed and approved by the Yuci Prefectural Committee. Therefore, the Presidium did not pay attention to the representatives' opinions at all and repeatedly explained to everyone to persuade everyone not to replace them. As a result, the two people were reluctantly elected. However, the representatives were very dissatisfied with this matter and talked about it a lot. Some people said, "Since the leadership already has a 'circle' of candidates, why bother letting everyone propose them?" Some people said, "Anyway, that's how it is. Whoever the higher-ups want to elect can't be removed." Some representatives wrote to the Party Central Committee that day to complain.

This situation shows that some Party Congresses have not fully promoted democracy in the election process, and even suppressed democracy. Some leading cadres lack the mass viewpoint and do not take the mass line in the election. They do not understand that the higher-level leading organs' understanding of the Party Committee candidates is limited. In order to achieve a perfect result in the election, the opinions of the leadership must be combined with the opinions of the Party members and the masses. It is necessary to ensure that Party members and the masses have the right to criticize and replace each candidate. Experience has proved that electing the Party Committee is one of the basic contents of intra-Party democracy, and the key to whether the election is democratic lies in whether serious discussions and criticisms can be carried out on the candidates, because serious discussions and criticisms on the candidates are a further examination and evaluation of the work of the previous Party Committee, and it is a mass-based and strict test for the leading cadres of the Party Committee. On this basis, outstanding workers who are trusted by Party members and the masses can be elected to the Party's leading organs at all levels. Therefore, the election of the Party Committee should be regarded as an important task of the Congress, as a work of great significance for improving and strengthening the collective leadership of the Party Committee, and should be given practical attention.

For Party organizations in many regions, there is still a lack of experience in convening Party Congresses. This requires Party organizations at all levels to not only attach great importance to the convening of Party Congresses, but also strive to do a good job in the various preparatory work for the meeting, pay attention to summarizing and exchanging experiences, and strengthen assistance and guidance from top to bottom, so that Party organizations at all levels can convene Party Congresses on a regular basis and continuously improve the level of Party Congresses.

    党代表大会是党内民主的基础
    白中
    党章规定，党代表大会和党员大会是各级党组织的最高领导机关，它有权审查和批准党委的工作报告，讨论和决定党的重大问题，选举党的各级领导机关——党的各级委员会。这说明党的代表大会制，是发扬党内民主、开展批评和自我批评的基础，是贯彻党的民主集中制和集体领导原则的重要保证。党的各级组织，如果能定期地召开党的代表大会，认真地在党代表大会上审查党的委员会的工作报告和选举新的委员会，那末，就可以更好地集中党员群众的经验和智慧来补充党委会经验的不足，使党的决议更加完善和正确；可以使党委的集体领导更加健全，使党委对党员群众负责的观念和与党员群众的联系更加加强起来；并可以大大提高党员群众的主人翁感，提高他们参加党的领导工作和贯彻党的决议、做好党的各项工作的自动性与积极性；同时，对于党内民主生活的开展也有重大的意义。
    四中全会后，党内民主生活有了进一步的发展，不少地方的党组织重视了召开党的代表大会。一九五四年，陕西、甘肃、青海等省召开了省党代表大会，天津、武汉、西安等二十个城市召开了市党代表大会，陕西、甘肃、青海、河北、热河等十个省和内蒙古自治区有一百九十七个县召开了县党代表大会，还有三十二个市属区和其他二十三个单位召开了党代表大会；另外，有些地方已经制定出了召开党代表大会的计划。各地召开的党代表大会，对贯彻党的总路线和四中全会决议起了很大的作用。这是一种好现象。
    但是，从全国范围来看，几年来，县以上各级党组织，虽然大部分召开过党代表会议，但大多没有召开党代表大会。这种情况对于发扬党内民主和改进党的工作来说是不利的。
    许多党组织没有按时召开党代表大会，固然有一些客观原因，但是有些地方的党组织，对召开党代表大会这一问题还重视不够，也是一个很重要的原因。比如有些人认为“工作繁忙，没有时间召开党代表大会”、或者认为“党代表大会不能解决当前工作问题，准备工作很麻烦，不如开干部会省事”。显然，这种认识是错误的。一九五四年到现在，陕西、甘肃、青海、山西等省普遍召开县以上各级党代表大会的经验证明，召开党代表大会对于改进领导和教育干部起了重大作用，因此，不仅不妨碍当前工作，并且大大地推动了当前的各项工作、特别是中心工作。山西省和顺县的党代表大会就是其中的一个例子。和顺县委于一九五五年一月十二日召开了第三次党代表大会，会议除听取了县委的工作报告、选举了新的县委会和出席省党代表大会的代表外，着重地讨论了统购统销、互助合作、春耕生产和征集补充兵员的工作，并通过了决议。县委在工作报告中作了充分的自我批评，并把县委一年来在领导统购统销和互助合作运动中存在的主要缺点由县委副书记向大会作了专题报告。在县委的启发和支持下，大会展开了自下而上的批评，到会的代表和列席的人员有二百多人（占到会人数的百分之八十）发表了意见，对县委领导上的缺点提出了许多批评。如有些代表说：“区乡干部写假报告是不对的，但县委也要负责，因为县委把生产计划订的太高，不切合实际，完不成任务就批评，结果有些干部为了应付上级便写假报告。”大会在选举县委员会时，对每个候选人都提出了批评和意见，有些候选人并对自己的缺点当众进行了检讨。像这样在充分发扬民主的基础上，讨论和决定了今后工作特别是当前工作中的重大问题，就会使这些决定更加切合实际，使大家的认识更加明确，提高大家完成这些任务的信心；同时，由于大会集中地检查了县委领导上的缺点，并在这一基础上选举了新的县委会，这对于领导干部和所有到会的同志都是一次很大的教育和提高，这种教育和提高，对今后工作所起的积极作用，是难以估价的。由此可见，党代表大会的作用是任何干部会议所不能代替的。
    目前，党的组织在全国范围内已有很大的发展，各项工作已经日渐走上轨道。在这种情况下，党的各级组织，就更有必要和可能按期地召开党的代表大会，以便更好地发挥全体党员的积极性，提高党的领导水平，来保证社会主义建设事业的顺利完成。
    当然，仅仅做到按期召开党代表大会是不够的，还必须认真开好党代表大会。开好党代表大会，要取决于许多条件，但其中最重要的条件之一，就是充分发扬民主。而发扬民主的关键，则在于党委的领导人员有没有自我批评的勇气和虚心接受党员群众的批评的精神。许多地区党组织召开党代表大会的经验和教训都证明了这一点。在这方面，目前值得注意的问题是，有些党代表大会，还没有把检查工作同批评和自我批评的重点放在党委的领导方面，而却过多地检查、批评下级党组织和党员的缺点。例如，有些党委的工作报告常常对工作成绩讲得很多，估计很高；对缺点和错误则不愿揭发，或者零碎地空洞地轻描淡写几句。由于有些党委领导干部缺乏自我批评精神，所以他们也就不积极启发和支持自下而上的批评，对于党员群众的批评和意见，不是消极应付、置之不理，便是或明或暗地加以限制和打击。抚顺市机修厂党组织在一次改选党委的大会上就发生过这样的情形。有些代表揭发了党委委员兼工会主席和工会工作中的许多缺点和错误，大会主席团便认为“太过火了，削弱工会的威信”，怕批评开展下去，会使工会主席不能连续当选为党委委员，因而立即召集代表组长开会进行“扭转”，并向发言人作“解释”；实际上这就是变相的压制批评。有些党组织的领导干部缺乏虚心接受批评的精神，因而常常把检查工作的重点放在下级党委和下级干部的身上，号召大家都作检讨。有的党代表大会甚至用了百分之五十的时间发动代表进行个人检讨和检查基层党组织的缺点。这种看法和做法同党章所规定的代表大会的职权是不相符合的。这说明有些同志还不了解或者没有深刻了解党代表大会应该着重检查党委领导和开展自下而上的批评的意义。刘少奇同志在“论党”一书中写道：“各级党的领导机关和负责人，应该定期地向选举自己的党员和下级组织报告自己的工作。在这种报告中，不只应该说到当前的情况和工作的成绩，而且应该说到缺点和弱点以及工作中的错误，请求自己的选举人和下级组织提出意见和批评。经验证明：许多下级组织和党员干部在工作中所发生的错误与缺点，其责任并不能由下级组织及党员与干部来担负，而应该由上级领导机关来担负。……”他又写道，凡是那个地方的负责人能够认真地诚恳地进行自我批评，那里的批评与自我批评就会发展，党员的工作积极性就会提高，工作就会改进，团结就会加强，而且负责人的信仰不独没有损失，反而会提高。当然，对下级党组织和党员干部的工作中的一般性质的缺点和错误，也同样应该进行批评的，但是，这不是党代表大会的主要任务。同时，只要领导干部在党代表大会上能够进行严肃的自我批评，能启发和教育下级干部进行自我批评，并虚心地接受批评，也就自然会使下级干部自觉地进行自我批评。河南孟津等县召开党代表大会后，不少区乡干部回去自动开会检讨自己在工作中的包办代替和强迫命令的作风，他们说：“县委书记在大会上都作自我检讨，我们有缺点还能不检讨吗？”群众反映说：“这次县上开会后，干部作风变了样。”
    在党代表大会发扬民主方面，目前值得注意的另一个问题，是不少地方对于选举党的委员会的工作还没有引起应有的重视，比如，把选举时间规定的过短、对候选人没有作必要的介绍和展开讨论和批评、对代表要求调换的候选人和新提出的候选人不提交大会讨论和表决、对代表的正确意见不予重视和采纳，而往往强调领导上提出的候选人已经“上级批准”不能变动。山西中阳县第二次党代表大会在选举新的县委会时就发生了这样的偏向。县委候选人名单中有两个人有比较严重的缺点和毛病。多数代表要求调换这两个候选人，主席团却强调这个名单是经过榆次地委审查批准的，因而根本不重视代表的意见，还反复地向大家解释，打通大家的思想，要大家不要调换。结果，这两个人还是勉强当选了。但是，代表们对这件事都非常不满意，议论纷纷，有人说“既然领导上已经有了候选名单的
  ‘圈圈’，何必再让大家提呢？”有人说“反正就是这么回事，上边要选谁，怎么也去不掉。”有的代表当天就向党中央写信控告。
    这种情况表明，有些党代表大会在选举过程中尚未充分发扬民主，甚至压制民主。有些领导干部缺乏群众观点，在选举中不走群众路线，他们不了解上级领导机关对党委候选人的了解是有局限性的，为了使选举达到完满的结果，就必须把领导上的意见和党员群众的意见结合起来，必须保证党员群众有批评和调换每个候选人的权利。经验证明，选举党委会，是党内民主的基本内容之一，而选举是否民主的关键则在于对候选人能否展开认真的讨论和批评，因为对候选人的认真讨论和批评，是对上届党委的工作进一步的检查和评定，对党委领导干部是一次群众性的、严格的考验，在这个基础上就能够使党员群众所信赖的、优秀的工作人员被选举到党的各级领导机关中去。因此应当把选举党委会当作代表大会的重要任务，当作对于改进和加强党委集体领导有重大意义的工作，切实予以重视。
    召开党的代表大会，对于许多地区的党组织来说，目前还缺乏经验。这就要求党的各级组织对党代表大会的召开不仅应予以极大的重视，还要努力做好会议的各项准备工作，注意总结和交流经验，加强自上而下的帮助和指导，以便各级党组织都能定期召开党代表大会，并不断地提高党代表大会的水平。
