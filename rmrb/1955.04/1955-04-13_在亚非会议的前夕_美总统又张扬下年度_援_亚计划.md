    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 12th: US President Eisenhower issued a statement on the 11th saying that he would submit his recommendations on the US "Mutual Security" program to the US Congress next week. This program includes the US economic "aid" plan for South and East Asian countries.
    According to Harold Stassen, director of the US Foreign Operations Administration, on March 17th, Eisenhower's "aid" plan for Asia will require Congress to allocate $2,140.5 million in the next fiscal year, of which three-fifths of the funds will be directly used for military purposes.
    However, in his statement on the 11th, Eisenhower talked a lot about the US wanting to improve the "economic welfare" of other countries.
    It is worth noting the timing of Eisenhower's proposal of his plan. A Reuters dispatch on the 7th said that Eisenhower would propose his "aid" plan during the Asian-African Conference, which is "very meaningful."

    在亚非会议的前夕
    美总统又张扬下年度“援”亚计划
    新华社十二日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔十一日发表声明说，他将在下星期把他的关于美国的“共同安全”计划的建议提交美国国会，在这个计划中包括了美国对南亚和东亚国家的经济“援助”的计划。
    据美国援外事务管理署署长史塔生在三月十七日宣布，艾森豪威尔的“援助”亚洲计划将要求国会在下一财政年度中拨款二十一亿四千零五十万美元，其中五分之三的款项将直接用于军事的目的。
    但是，艾森豪威尔在他十一日的声明中，却大谈什么美国要增进别的国家的“经济福利”。
    值得注意的是：艾森豪威尔提出他的计划的时机。路透社七日消息说，艾森豪威尔将在举行亚非会议的时候提出他的“援助”计划，这一点是“意味深长”的。
