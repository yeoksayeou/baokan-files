Guiding Peasants to Recognize the New Atmosphere in Today's Rural Areas
Li Xingcun

Many new atmospheres and new faces have emerged in the countryside today, which is the result of the socialist transformation implemented in rural areas. However, the vast majority of grassroots cadres and peasant masses are not able to clearly recognize these new achievements. We must guide the peasants to recognize these achievements, which is an effective way to encourage the peasants' production enthusiasm and promote the progress of various tasks.

How to guide them? There are many different methods. Making them clearly recognize the changes in their own village and township in recent years is a very good method. Here is an example to illustrate this point.

In early March, a comrade went to Liwan Village in Changli County, Hebei Province, and held a discussion with township cadres, asking about the difficulties and favorable conditions in this year's agricultural production. Everyone only talked about the difficult side, such as insufficient animal power, lack of feed, etc.; but they couldn't talk about any favorable conditions at all. However, at another small symposium (three cooperative cadres and two members), the comrade changed his approach and asked what the differences were between Liwan Village in recent years and in the past. After thinking for a while, everyone successively stated many major changes in the village:

(1) In the past, there were many individual households, but now there are many cooperatives. Because the cooperatives have shown their superiority, the enthusiasm of peasants for mutual assistance and cooperation has greatly increased. (2) In the past, more than 60 percent of the households in the village lacked grain, but now, except for a few households, the vast majority have become surplus grain households. The lives of peasants have improved: almost every household has a thermos bottle, everyone has a woolen coat, young adults have uniforms, and the elderly wear woolen socks. (3) In the past, the grain produced in the village was not enough to eat every year and had to be bought from outside the customs, but now, in addition to self-sufficiency, hundreds of thousands of kilograms of surplus grain can be sold every year. (4) In the past, every winter and spring, there were many people smoking and chatting idly on the streets, but now these people are gone. (5) In the past, women did not participate in labor, thinking that labor was shameful, but now they all participate in labor, thinking that this is the greatest glory. In the past, people thought that to be able to marry a wife, one must be able to support her, and that it was shameful to let a wife participate in labor. This idea has now completely changed. (6) In the past, the majority of children in the village were out of school, but now the majority of children are in school. Before liberation, there were only five middle school students and more than ten senior primary school students in the whole village, but now there are more than fifty middle school students and more than two hundred senior primary school students. (7) In the past, poor people had difficulties in life and production, and landlords and rich peasants would not lend them money, and if they did, they would charge high interest, which could not be paid off in a lifetime. Now the county has a bank, the village has a credit cooperative, and the government also provides assistance, so the difficulties have been overcome. (8) In the past, there were many people in the village buying and selling land, hiring long-term laborers, and lending at high interest, but now there are none. (9) In the past, land cultivation was very rough, without autumn plowing and little fertilizer application, but now cultivation is meticulous, fertilizer application has increased, and there are some new agricultural tools and pesticides. (10) Rural customs have changed: in the past, there were many thieves, idlers, and gamblers, but now the number of thieves and idlers has been greatly reduced, and there are no more gamblers. In the past, "feng shui masters" who looked at auspicious days were very active when there were weddings, funerals, buying, and selling, but now they are gone. Parents, parents-in-law, children, and daughters-in-law democratically handle production and life issues, and families are harmonious and united.

After concentrating on the "ten changes" in the village, the five people who participated in the symposium suddenly realized the new situation in the village and the favorable conditions for production, so everyone was very excited. It can be seen from this that guiding peasants to recognize new things in connection with reality is not only suitable for the peasants' level of understanding, but also can improve the peasants' political awareness, and is a method that can be adopted anytime and anywhere in various places.

Here is a question: Why do peasants need guidance? Guidance is a method of education, and only by educating peasants in various ways from all aspects can their socialist awareness be improved. Awareness can be turned into actual action. In this way, all problems can be easily solved. Why do peasants have insufficient understanding of these things they have personally experienced and need us to guide them? This is because, although the various socialist measures fundamentally conform to the interests of the peasants, they do not completely conform to their habits, and are often in conflict with their demands as small private owners of the means of production. For example, as small private owners, peasants naturally demand freedom of trade and are unwilling to accept the state's plans; however, for the benefit of the country and the peasants, and for the construction of socialism, we have to implement unified purchase and sale of grain and other important agricultural products. Similarly, the gradual change of peasants' ownership through production cooperation is certainly not easy for them to accept. Moreover, some of our work still has shortcomings, and some work is done relatively crudely, lacking in-depth publicity and explanation, so peasants often only see the side that does not conform to their habits, only see the side that conflicts with their demands, and do not see the side that is beneficial to them, just as the saying goes, "People in happiness do not know happiness." For peasants who are small private owners, this situation is not surprising at all. However, since the side that is beneficial to them, the side of "happiness," does exist objectively and is indeed being experienced by them personally, as long as we patiently guide and enlighten them, they will be able to recognize it. Let us patiently guide the peasants to recognize the increasingly bright side of their lives and encourage their enthusiasm for production.

    引导农民认识目前农村中的新气象
    李杏村
    当前农村里出现了许多新的气象和新的面貌，这是在农村实行社会主义改造的结果。但是，广大的基层干部和农民群众，并不是都能清醒地认识这些新的成就。我们必须引导农民认识这些成就，这是鼓舞农民的生产情绪，推动各种工作前进的有效的方法。
    怎样引导呢？方法是多种多样的。使他们明确认识本村本乡几年来的变化，就是很好的方法。这里不妨举一个例子来说明这个问题。
    三月初，有一位同志到河北省昌黎县的犁湾村，和乡干部座谈，问到今年农业生产中有些什么困难，有些什么有利条件。大家只说到困难的一面，如畜力不足，饲料缺乏等等；而有利条件，却一点也谈不出来。可是在另一个小型座谈会上（社干部三人，社员两人），那位同志换了一种方式，询问犁湾村这几年来和过去有些什么不同，大家想了一想，就接二连三地说出了本村许多重大的变化：
  （一）过去单干户多，现在合作社多。由于合作社显示了优越性，农民互助合作的积极性大大提高了。（二）过去村里百分之六十以上的户缺粮，现在除了少数几户外，绝大部分变成余粮户了。农民的生活改善了：几乎家家户户有个暖水瓶，人人都有件绒衣，青壮年都有身制服，老年人都穿上了洋线袜子。（三）过去本村打的粮食年年不够吃，要靠从关外买进粮食，现在除了自给之外，年年可以卖出几十万斤余粮。（四）过去，本村每到冬春季节，街上东一伙西一伙吸烟闲聊天的人很多，现在看不见这种人了。（五）过去妇女都不参加劳动，认为劳动可耻，现在都参加劳动了，认为这是最大的光荣。过去人们认为要娶得起老婆就要能养活她，认为让老婆参加劳动很丢人，这种想法现在根本改变了。（六）过去村里失学儿童占多数，现在入学儿童占多数。解放前，全村只有五名中学生，十多名高小生，现在有五十多名中学生，二百多名高小生。（七）过去穷人生活生产困难，地主富农有钱也不借给，借给的就要重利，一辈子也还不清。现在县有银行，村有信贷社，政府还照顾，困难克服了。（八）过去本村买卖土地、雇长工、放高利贷的多，现在没有了。（九）过去土地耕作很粗糙，不秋耕，上粪少，现在耕作细致，肥料增加，有了一些新式农具和农药。（十）农村风俗改变了：过去小偷、二流子、赌钱的多，现在小偷、二流子大大减少了，赌钱的没有了。过去如遇婚、丧、买、卖，看吉日的“风水先生”很活跃，现在不见了。公、婆、儿、媳民主处理生产生活问题，家庭和睦团结了。
    参加座谈会的五个人，在集中了本村的“十点变化”后，便恍然大悟：看到了本村的新情况和生产上的有利条件，因此大家都很兴奋。由此可见，联系实际引导农民认识新事物，既适合于农民的觉悟水平，又能提高农民的政治觉悟，是各地可以随时随地采用的方法。
      这里提出一个问题：农民为什么需要引导？引导是一种教育方法，只有用各种方法从各方面向农民进行教育，才能提高他们的社会主义觉悟。觉悟能变成实际的行动。这样，一切问题也就容易解决了。为什么农民对自己亲身经历的这些事也认识不足，而需要我们去引导呢？这是因为，各项社会主义措施虽然是根本上符合农民的利益的，但是并不完全符合他们的习惯，而且往往是和他们作为生产资料的小私有者的要求相抵触的。比如，作为小私有者，农民很自然地要求贸易自由，不愿接受国家的计划；我们为了国家和农民的利益，为了建设社会主义，却不能不对粮食等等重要的农产品实行统购统销。同样地，生产合作逐步改变农民的所有制，当然更不是很容易就能为他们接受的。况且我们有些工作还有缺点，有些工作又做得比较粗糙，缺乏深入的宣传解释，所以，农民就往往只看到不合他们习惯的那一面，只看到和他们的要求相抵触的一面，而看不到对他们有利的那一面，正像俗话所说的那样，“人在福中不知福”。对于小私有者的农民说来，这种情况是一点也不奇怪的。可是，既然对他们有利的那一面，“福”的那一面，是在客观上确确实实存在着，而且是他们亲身经历着的，所以，只要我们耐心地加以引导和启发，他们是能够认识到的。让我们耐心地去引导农民认识他们生活中越来越光明的这一面，把他们的生产积极性鼓舞起来吧。
