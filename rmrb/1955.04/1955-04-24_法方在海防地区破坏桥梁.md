    法方在海防地区破坏桥梁
    新华社河内二十三日电　据越南通讯社二十二日讯：法兰西联邦部队继续在海防地区破坏桥梁。
    法兰西联邦部队在四月十七日部分地拆掉建安省的干桥后，在次日上午又派遣了两千五百名部队，在军舰、坦克和飞机的掩护下继续拆除这座桥。十八日上午十时，整个干桥就被拆掉了。在这次法方破坏干桥时，大约有三千居民赶来阻止，但是遭受到法兰西联邦部队凶残的毒打，有十一个平民受了重伤。
    十九日清晨，法兰西联邦部队动员了陆、海、空军去拆除建安省的另一座桥——客桥。当地三千多居民跑来阻止，但是同样遭到法兰西联邦部队的毒打，有二十多个平民被打伤了。
    上述法方非法拆除桥梁和对居民采取恐怖手段的行为已经在人民中间引起强烈的愤慨。
