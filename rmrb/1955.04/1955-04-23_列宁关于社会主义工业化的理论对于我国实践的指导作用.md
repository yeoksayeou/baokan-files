    Lenin's Theory of Socialist Industrialization and its Guiding Role in China's Practice
    Di Chaobai
    Our country is gradually realizing the socialist industrialization of the country. During the first five-year plan period, we must establish a preliminary foundation for the country's socialist industrialization. 1955 is a year of decisive significance for the construction of China's first five-year plan. At this time, as we commemorate Lenin, we should especially study Lenin's theory of socialist industrialization, and we should further understand the guiding significance of Lenin's theory for our country's socialist construction.

      (1) The Significance of Large-Scale Industry for Socialist Construction

    The basic policy of socialist industrialization is a new contribution that Lenin added to the treasure house of Marxism.

    Lenin was a scientific master of Marxism. Based on the law discovered by Marx that the relations of production must conform to the nature of the productive forces, he studied the situation of modern society and came to this conclusion: In economically backward countries where capitalist large-scale industry has not yet been fully developed, the proletariat should not let go of favorable conditions for seizing power. After seizing power, the proletariat should use all methods to develop large-scale industry in order to transform the small-peasant economy, defeat capitalism, and ensure the final victory of socialism.

    Lenin once pointed out the great significance of large-scale industry for socialist construction:

    "There is only one real and sole foundation for consolidating resources and building a socialist society, and that is large-scale industry."

    "The basic and most important interests of the proletariat are to establish large-scale industry and create a solid economic foundation within large-scale industry; only then can the proletariat consolidate its dictatorship."

    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have entered the transitional period from New Democracy to Socialism. Following Lenin's teachings, the Chinese Communist Party regards socialist industrialization as the basic path for our country's socialist construction. As early as the Anti-Japanese War period, Chairman Mao pointed out the necessity of implementing national industrialization in the socialist revolution stage in the book "On Coalition Government." He said:

      "After the New Democratic political conditions are obtained, the Chinese people and their government must take practical steps to gradually establish heavy and light industries within a few years, so that China can be transformed from an agricultural country into an industrial country. A New Democratic country cannot be consolidated without a solid economic foundation, without agriculture that is more advanced than the present, and without large-scale industry that accounts for a great advantage in the national economy, as well as transportation, trade, finance and other undertakings that are adapted to it." On the eve of the founding of New China, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in the article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "The state of the people's democratic dictatorship must solve the problem of this country's industrialization step by step."

    After the founding of New China, Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly emphasized the importance of developing industry for our country's socialist construction. In 1952, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, pointed out that gradually achieving the socialist industrialization, gradually achieving the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce, is the party's general line during the transition period.

    Currently, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of our country are striving to gradually realize the country's socialist industrialization. It is expected that after three five-year plans, our country can basically realize the country's socialist industrialization.

      (2) Prioritized Development of Heavy Industry

    In his instructions on building large-scale industry, Lenin especially pointed out the priority of building heavy industry. He believed that the main foundation of socialism is heavy industry.

    Lenin's theory on the priority development of heavy industry mainly has the following basic contents: First, the proletariat has seized power and has the possibility of planning the construction of industry in accordance with the laws of socialist economic development. Second, according to Marx's theory of expanded reproduction, to carry out social expanded reproduction, there must first be means of production available for expanded production, the most important of which is the means of production. Therefore, only by prioritizing the development of heavy industry can socialist countries foreseeably carry out social expanded reproduction. Third, to completely change the situation where small production occupies a dominant position, it is necessary to establish a strong heavy industry foundation, especially the machine manufacturing industry, which is the basic link to eliminate the contradiction between socialist large-scale production and the small peasant economy. Fourth, in order to consolidate the independence of the proletarian state in the encirclement of world capitalism, it is necessary to quickly establish a modernized national defense, and national defense construction is inseparable from heavy industry construction.

    Naturally, prioritizing the development of heavy industry does not mean developing heavy industry in isolation. According to Marx's point of view that the first category and the second category must be organically linked, there must be a certain proportional relationship between light and heavy industry at various stages of national economic development. During the transition period, the proletarian state must correctly grasp this proportion. The law of distribution according to work also requires that light industry must have a certain degree of development to adapt to the rapid expansion of heavy industry.

    In the context of the rapid development of heavy industry, agriculture must also be developed accordingly, and a correct proportional relationship between industry and agriculture must be established. Therefore, developing heavy industry in isolation is contrary to Lenin's principles.

    Lenin's theory of prioritizing the development of heavy industry plays a guiding role in our country's socialist construction. The basic task stipulated in our country's first five-year plan is to concentrate major efforts on developing heavy industry to establish the foundation for national industrialization and the modernization of national defense; at the same time, correspondingly cultivate construction talents and develop transportation, light industry, agriculture and commerce. This is the specific application of Lenin's theory of prioritizing the development of heavy industry in our country, which ensures that our country's first five-year plan can advance on the right track.

    We are a country with a very weak heavy industry foundation, and we must first build some of the most basic heavy industries before we can fully establish a strong heavy industry. Only by establishing a strong heavy industry can socialism achieve complete victory in our country.

    Concentrating major efforts on developing heavy industry is also closely related to our international environment. Imperialism is eyeing us covetously. U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group still occupy our Taiwan and some coastal islands. We must speed up the construction of heavy industry to enhance our national defense strength.

    During the construction of the first five-year plan, maintaining the necessary proportional relationship between the various sectors of the national economy and gradually tightening the link between industry and agriculture is conducive to the smooth development of heavy industry. However, in order to concentrate more funds on heavy industry, the development of transportation, light industry and other departments should rely more on tapping potential, improving production technology, strictly implementing economic accounting and increasing labor productivity.

    Our country's socialist industrialization has obtained the great material and technical assistance from the Soviet Union, which makes our difficulties less than those of the Soviet Union in those years, and greatly increases the speed of our country's industrialization. Lenin repeatedly mentioned at that time that if the proletarian revolution could win victory in industrialized countries, the period for the Soviet Union to transition to socialism could be shortened. For all people's democratic countries, the favorable international environment for developing socialist industry has basically been obtained today due to the great achievements of the Soviet Union.

      (3) Capital Accumulation

    Developing heavy industry requires a large amount of capital. Where does this capital come from? Lenin pointed out the following main sources:

    First, profit accumulation in commerce: "Even so, we have seen a significant improvement, and we see that our commercial activities have brought us a portion of capital. Although this number is still very small, slightly more than 20 million gold rubles. But in any case, the foundation has been laid: we can obtain resources from our commerce, and we can use these resources to improve heavy industry."

      Second, it is to implement strict streamlining and savings: Lenin repeatedly mentioned in many articles and letters in 1922-1923 that strict savings should be implemented, and any savings should be preserved in order to develop heavy industry, and that state organs should be reduced and savings should be maximized.

      Third, increasing labor productivity is the most basic condition for guaranteeing the growth of socialist economic components. Lenin pointed out: "Labor productivity is, in the final analysis, the most important and main condition for guaranteeing the victory of the new social system. Capitalism has created labor productivity that did not exist under the serf system. Capitalism can be completely defeated, and it will definitely be completely defeated, because socialism can create new and much higher labor productivity." Regarding the methods of increasing labor productivity, in addition to relying on the revolutionary enthusiasm of the laborers and relying on strengthening labor discipline, it also depends on the law of distribution according to work. Lenin wrote in "Four Years Since the October Revolution": "Not directly based on enthusiasm, but with the help of the enthusiasm generated by the great revolution, based on personal interests, based on personal interest, based on economic accounting, to first strive to build some strong bridges from state capitalism to socialism in this small agricultural country; otherwise, you will not reach communism, otherwise, you will not be able to guide hundreds of millions of people to communism. Actual life has told us this. The objective course of revolutionary development has told us this." Lenin advocated the implementation of piece-rate wages, rewards, and bonus systems. At the same time, he believed that the main form of managing state-owned enterprises is economic accounting, "The transformation of state-owned enterprises to so-called economic accounting is inevitably inextricably linked to the New Economic Policy, and in the near future, this form will certainly become, if not the only, also the most important form."

    Capital relies on internal accumulation, which is closely related to the nature of socialist relations of production. The working class must rely on and only rely on its own labor to build socialism and push it towards communism. Our country has obtained and will continue to obtain great assistance from the Soviet Union during the recovery period and the socialist construction period that has already begun. This assistance has greatly accelerated the progress of our country's socialist construction. However, the factor that determines the successful completion of the construction plan is still the selfless labor of our country's working class. The characteristics of heavy industry construction are that the investment amount per enterprise unit is very large, the construction period is long, and the capital turnover is slow. Therefore, we must carry out strict savings in capital construction, strive to complete the plan ahead of schedule, and put it into production as early as possible.

    Increasing production and practicing economy in enterprise production is an infinite source of capital accumulation and the foundation for the development of capital construction. In the past five years, our country's working class has learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and exerted its labor enthusiasm on the production front. It has achieved many results in streamlining and saving state-owned enterprises, reducing costs, and increasing labor productivity. These achievements prove that socialist enterprises are far superior to private capitalist enterprises. Naturally, we still have many shortcomings in this regard: enterprise organizations are generally bloated, the proportion of non-production expenses is too large, there is still a lot of waste and backlog of raw materials, the equipment utilization rate of many enterprises is not high, and even some new machines are left idle, the turnover of working capital is very slow, labor discipline is not good enough, and production has a phenomenon of being hot and cold...etc. These shortcomings make our product costs still very high; improving labor productivity through economic accounting and improving working methods is not a universal and continuous development phenomenon; the awareness of the employees about "relying on internal accumulation," a crucial aspect of socialism, is not clear enough, and their understanding of completing the plan is one-sided, and in practice, they only pay attention to completing the output plan and ignore other aspects. As a result, the price of products has decreased very little or not at all, and the profits of enterprises generally remain stagnant, far behind the potential of the enterprises and the needs of the country.

    In order to correct these shortcomings, it is necessary to improve labor organization, improve working methods, strictly implement savings in materials and financial resources, comprehensively promote economic accounting in enterprises, extensively carry out socialist labor competitions, strengthen political work, and improve the socialist awareness of employees. Only in this way can we accumulate more capital for the country and ensure the smooth realization of the socialist industrialization plan.

      (4) The Cadre Problem

    Developing industry requires a large number of skilled scientific and technical personnel. In the period after the October Socialist Revolution, Lenin emphasized the use of bourgeois experts. However, the scale of socialist industrial construction is extremely large. The basic issue is still to train more new scientific and technical personnel. Lenin said: "The main things that we still lack are cultural level and management skills... In the economic and political aspects, the New Economic Policy completely guarantees that we can build the foundation of a socialist economy. The problem 'only' lies in the cultural talents of the proletariat and its vanguard."

    It is inseparable to value and help specialists participate in socialist construction and to accelerate the training of tens of millions of new scientific and technical personnel. Ignoring either side will cause great harm to socialist construction.

    In this regard, we are also following Lenin's instructions. Our country's first five-year plan correspondingly cultivates construction talents under the premise of concentrating major efforts on developing heavy industry. We know that advanced science and technology are closely related to socialist industrialization; heavy industry construction requires advanced technology and ever-changing scientific research. Defects or backwardness in the technical equipment of a certain heavy industry enterprise will seriously affect other enterprises and other departments.

    We now have a condition that is superior to the Soviet socialist construction period, that is, the help of Soviet experts who are completely trustworthy in politics and science and technology, because they have become the main pillars and teachers of our country's capital construction and various scientific and technical departments. They not only use advanced technology to help us build large-scale industries, but also have made outstanding contributions in various aspects such as scientific research and personnel training.

    Of course, the most important thing is to develop and cultivate our country's own scientific and technological forces. On the one hand, we must give full play to the role of specialists trained in the old society; on the other hand, a large number of our staff members are also beginning to study technology in order to master their work; and it is even more important to train a large number of new industrial technical personnel and industrial management personnel.

    In the past few years, the number of construction talents trained by higher education and secondary education in our country has greatly increased, and great achievements have also been made in improving the scientific and technical level of employees from actual work. There have also been many achievements in uniting and transforming the original scientific and technical personnel. However, we still have many shortcomings in learning from Soviet experts, in uniting domestic scientists, and in learning science and technology and training cadres. At present, science and technology are still the weakest link in our work, and progress is slow, which is not commensurate with the needs and development speed of our country's industrial construction. Therefore, improving this work is an important task at present.

    Lenin's theory of socialist industrialization has played a great guiding role in our country's practice. The vigorous development of socialist industry in our country in the past few years is a clear proof that Lenin's thought has achieved a great victory. In the future, as long as we continue to follow Lenin's teachings and learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, we can build our country into a great, highly industrialized, socialist country.

    列宁关于社会主义工业化的理论对于我国实践的指导作用
    狄超白
    我国正在逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化。在第一个五年计划期间，我们必须为国家的社会主义工业化建立初步基础。一九五五年是我国第一个五年计划建设具有决定意义的一年。在这时候，我们纪念列宁，应该特别要学习列宁关于社会主义工业化的理论，应该进一步了解列宁这一理论对于我国社会主义建设的指导意义。
      （一）大工业对于社会主义
            建设的意义
    社会主义工业化的基本方针，是列宁添加到马克思主义宝库里的新贡献。
    列宁是马克思主义的科学大师。他依据马克思所发现的生产关系一定要适合生产力性质的规律，研究现代社会的情况，得到这样的结论：在资本主义大工业尚未充分发展的经济落后的国家里，无产阶级不应放过夺取政权的有利条件。无产阶级在夺取政权之后，应该用一切方法发展大工业，以便改造小农经济，战胜资本主义，使社会主义获得最后胜利。
    列宁曾这样指出大工业对于社会主义建设的重大意义：
    “巩固资源、建立社会主义社会底真正的和唯一的基础，只有一个，这就是大工业。”
    “无产阶级底基本的与最重要的利益，是建立大工业和在大工业里面创造巩固的经济基础；那时，无产阶级才能巩固自己的专政”。
    自中华人民共和国成立起，我们即已进入从新民主主义到社会主义的过渡时期。遵循着列宁的教导，中国共产党把社会主义工业化当作我国社会主义建设的基本道路。远在抗日战争时期，毛主席就在“论联合政府”一书中指出社会主义革命阶段中实行国家工业化的必要。他说：
      “在新民主主义的政治条件获得之后，中国人民及其政府必须采取切实的步骤，在若干年内逐步地建立重工业和轻工业，使中国由农业国变为工业国。新民主主义的国家，如无巩固的经济做它的基础，如无进步的比较现时发达得多的农业，如无大规模的在全国经济比重上占极大优势的工业以及与此相适应的交通、贸易、金融等事业做它的基础，是不能巩固的。”在新中国成立前夕，毛泽东同志在
  “论人民民主专政”一文中又指出：“人民民主专政的国家，必须有步骤地解决这个国家工业化的问题。”
    在新中国成立之后，毛泽东同志多次强调发展工业对我国社会主义建设的重要意义。一九五二年，以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央委员会指出，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步实现对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，是党在过渡时期的总路线。
    目前，我国人民正在中国共产党的领导下，为逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化而奋斗。预计经过三个五年计划，我国就可以基本上实现国家的社会主义工业化。
      （二）优先发展重工业
    列宁在建设大工业的指示中，特别指出建设重工业的优先地位。他认为，社会主义的主要基础，就是重工业。
    列宁关于优先发展重工业的理论，主要有下列几个基本内容：第一，无产阶级掌握了政权，有可能按照社会主义经济的发展规律有计划地建设工业。第二，按照马克思扩大再生产的学说，要进行社会的扩大再生产，必须先有可供扩大生产的生产资料，其中最重要的是生产工具。因此，只有优先发展重工业才能使社会主义国家有预见地进行社会扩大再生产。第三，要彻底改变小生产占优势的情况，必须要建立雄厚的重工业基础，其中尤其是机器制造业，这是消灭社会主义大生产与小农经济之间的矛盾的基本环节。第四，为要在世界资本主义的包围中巩固无产阶级国家的独立，必须赶速建立现代化的国防，而国防建设与重工业建设是不可分的。
    自然，优先发展重工业并不是孤立发展重工业，按照马克思关于第一部类和第二部类必须有机联系的论点，国民经济各个发展阶段上轻重工业之间是必须有一定的比例关系，在过渡时期，无产阶级国家必须正确地掌握这个比例。按劳取酬的规律也使得轻工业必须有一定程度的发展以适应重工业的迅速扩大。
    在迅速发展重工业的情况下，还必须相应地发展农业，建立工业和农业之间正确的比例关系。因此，孤立发展重工业，是和列宁的原则相违背的。
    列宁的优先发展重工业的理论，对于我国社会主义建设起着指导作用。我国第一个五年计划的基本任务规定要集中主要力量发展重工业，建立国家工业化和国防现代化的基础；同时相应地培养建设人材，发展交通运输业、轻工业、农业和商业。这就是列宁的优先发展重工业的学说在我国的具体运用，它保证了我国第一个五年计划能够在正确的轨道上前进。
    我们是一个重工业基础非常薄弱的国家，我们首先要建设一些最基本的重工业，才能全面地建立起强大的重工业。只有建立起强大的重工业，社会主义才能在我国取得完全胜利。
    集中主要力量发展重工业，也和我们的国际环境有密切关系。帝国主义正在觊觑我们。美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团目前还占领我们的台湾和一些沿海岛屿，我们必须加紧建设重工业来增强我们的国防力量。
    在第一个五年计划建设期间，国民经济各部门保持必要的比例关系，工农业之间的联系逐步密切，是有利于重工业的顺利发展的。但为了集中更多资金投放在重工业，交通运输业、轻工业及其他部门的发展应更多地依靠发掘潜在能力，改进生产技术，厉行经济核算制和提高劳动生产率。
    我国的社会主义工业化取得苏联的伟大的物质技术援助，这就使得我们较之当年的苏联困难要少，使得我国工业化速度大大提高起来。列宁当时曾一再提到假如无产阶级革命能在工业先进国家获得胜利，苏联过渡到社会主义的期限就可以缩短。对于各人民民主国家来说，发展社会主义工业的有利国际环境，今天由于苏联的伟大成就，基本上已经获得了。
      （三）资金积累
    发展重工业需要大量资金。这些资金从何而来呢？列宁指出了如下几个主要来源：
    第一，商业中的利润积累：“虽然这样，我们已见到有显著的改善，并且我们看见，我国的商业活动，已替我们弄来了一部分资本。这数目虽还很小，略略超过二千万金卢布。但无论如何，始基是已经奠定了：我们从我国商业中已能弄到资财，我们能够利用这种资财来改善重工业。”
      第二，是实行严格的精简节约：列宁在一九二二——一九二三年的许多文章和信件中一再提到要严格的节省，把任何一点贮蓄都保存起来，借以发展重工业，并且要缩减国家机关人员，尽量节省。
      第三，提高劳动生产率，这是保证社会主义经济成分增长的最基本的条件。列宁指出：“劳动生产率，归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最重要最主要的条件。资本主义造成了在农奴制度下所没有过的劳动生产率。资本主义可以被彻底战胜，而且一定会被彻底战胜，是因为社会主义能造成新的更高得多的劳动生产率。”关于提高劳动生产率的方法，除掉依靠劳动者的革命热忱，依靠加强劳动纪律而外，还要依靠按劳取酬的规律。列宁在“十月革命四周年”一文中写道：“不是直接依据热忱，而是借助于伟大革命所产生的热忱，依据个人利益，依据个人兴趣，依据经济核算，来在这小农国家内，首先努力建成些经过国家资本主义通到社会主义去的坚固小桥；否则，你们就达不到共产主义，否则，你们就不能把千百万人引导到共产主义。实际生活曾是这样告诉我们的。革命发展的客观进程曾是这样告诉我们的”。列宁主张实行计件工资、奖励和奖金制度。同时认为管理国家企业的主要形式是经济核算，“把国家企业转到所谓经济核算制上，这一转化必然与新经济政策发生不可分离的联系，而在最近将来，这种形式定会成为若非唯一的，也是最主要的形式”。
    资金依靠内部积累，是和社会主义生产关系的性质有密切关系的。工人阶级必须依靠而且只有依靠自己的劳动才能建设起社会主义并把它推向共产主义。我国在恢复时期和已经开始的社会主义建设时期已经得到而且将会继续得到苏联伟大的援助，这种援助大大加速我国社会主义建设的进度。然而决定胜利完成建设计划的因素仍然是我国工人阶级的忘我的劳动。重工业建设的特点是每一企业单位投资量很大，建设时期较长，资金周转较慢。因此我们必须在基本建设中进行严格的节约，争取提前完成计划，提早投入生产。
    企业生产中的增产节约，是资金积累的无穷泉源，是基本建设得以开展的基础。在过去五年中，我国工人阶级学习苏联先进经验，在生产战线上发挥自己的劳动热忱，已经在国营企业的精简节约、降低成本、提高劳动生产率等方面取得不少成绩，这些成绩证明社会主义企业远较私人资本主义企业为优越。自然，我们在这方面还有很大缺点：企业机构一般地还臃肿，非生产费用的比例过大，原材料还有不少浪费和积压，许多企业的设备利用率不高，甚至有些新机器闲置不用，流动资金周转很慢，劳动纪律不够好，生产有忽冷忽热的现象……等等，这些缺点使得我们的产品成本仍然很高；通过经济核算和改进工作方法而提高劳动生产率，还不是普遍的、持续发展的现象；职工群众对于“依靠内部积累”这一具有关键性的社会主义自觉还不够明确，对于完成计划的了解是片面的，实际上只注意产量计划的完成而不顾其他。结果是产品的价格降低很少或者没有降低，企业利润一般的还是踏步不前，远远落后于企业的潜力和国家的需要。
    为要纠正这些缺点，就必须改进劳动组织，改进工作方法，在物力、财力方面厉行节约，在企业中全面地推行经济核算，广泛开展社会主义的劳动竞赛，加强政治工作，提高职工群众的社会主义觉悟，只有这样，才能为国家积累更多资金，保证社会主义工业化计划顺利实现。
      （四）干部问题
    发展工业必须有大量熟练的科学技术人材。在十月社会主义革命后的若干时期，列宁强调利用资产阶级专家。但社会主义工业建设的规模是极其宏大的。基本的问题还在培养更多的新的科学技术人材。列宁说：“我们尚嫌不够的主要东西，就是文化程度和管理上的技能……在经济和政治方面，新经济政策完全保证我们能建成社会主义经济底基础。问题‘只’在于无产阶级及其先锋队底文化人材”。
    重视和帮助专门家参加社会主义建设以及加速培养千万新的科学技术人材，二者是不可分离的，忽视任何一方都会在社会主义建设中造成极大损害。
    在这一方面，我们也是遵循着列宁的指示的。我国的第一个五年计划，在集中主要力量发展重工业的前提下，相应地培养建设人材。我们知道，先进的科学技术同社会主义工业化是有密切关系的；重工业建设是需要高度的技术和日新月异的科学研究的。某一重工业企业在技术设备方面有缺点或者落后，就会使其他企业和其他部门受到严重影响。
    我们现在具备了一个较苏联社会主义建设时期优越的条件，那就是在政治上和科学技术上完全可以信任的苏联专家的帮助，因为他们已成为我国基本建设和各科学技术部门的主要支柱和教师，他们不仅以高度的技术来帮助我们建设规模宏大的工业，并且在科学研究和培养人材等各方面也都有了卓越的贡献。
    当然，要发挥和培养我国自己的科学技术力量是最重要的事情。一方面要充分发挥旧社会培养出来的专门家的作用；另一方面我们大批工作人员也正开始钻研技术，以求精通业务；而大量培养新的工业技术人材和工业管理人材，更是重要。
    这几年来，我国的高等教育和中等教育培养出来的建设人材已大大增加，从实际工作中提高职工的科学技术水平，也已经获得很大成绩，对于原有科学技术人材的团结和改造，也有许多成就。但我们在向苏联专家学习方面，在团结国内科学家方面，以及学习科学技术和培养干部方面，都还存在着不少缺点。目前科学技术仍为我们工作中的最薄弱的环节，并且进步较慢，这和我国工业建设的需要和发展速度是不相适应的。因此，改进这种工作是当前的重要任务。
    列宁关于社会主义工业化的理论，对于我国的实践，已经起了极大的指导作用，这几年来，我国社会主义工业蓬勃地发展，就是列宁思想获得伟大胜利的明证。今后只要不断地遵循列宁的教导，学习苏联的先进经验，我们就可以把自己的国家建成一个伟大的、高度工业化的、社会主义的国家。
