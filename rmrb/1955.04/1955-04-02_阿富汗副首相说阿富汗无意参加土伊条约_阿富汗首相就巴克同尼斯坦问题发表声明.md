　　Xinhua News Agency, April 1st, Kabul dispatch: Afghan Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammed Naim Khan said in a statement on March 30th that Afghanistan has no intention of joining the Turkish-Iraqi military pact. He said that Afghanistan firmly opposes any action that would deviate it from its traditional policy of neutrality in world affairs.

　　Naim Khan also said that he will lead a delegation of seven people to attend the upcoming Asian-African Conference. He believes that the Asian-African Conference should try to strengthen economic and cultural ties between the countries participating in the conference.

　　Xinhua News Agency, April 1st, TASS Kabul dispatch, March 31st: Newspapers published a statement by Afghan Prime Minister Sardar Mohammed Daoud Khan. The statement commented on the Pakistani government's attempt to include the areas inhabited by the Pashtun tribes close to Afghanistan into West Pakistan, while merging the provinces and states of West Pakistan into a single administrative unit.

　　It is well known that Afghanistan advocates the establishment of an independent Pakhtunistan.

　　The statement pointed out, "The Afghan government has never recognized and does not now recognize Pakhtunistan as part of Pakistani territory," and believes that Pakistan's actions violate the wishes of the people of Pakhtunistan to decide their future, and that the purpose of this action is to "eliminate the freedom and national survival of our Pakhtunistan brothers." The statement said: "The Afghan government has decided to notify Pakistan of the adverse consequences of this aggressive decision and lodge a protest." The Afghan Prime Minister emphasized that the entire responsibility for such actions that "endanger the tranquility and peace of this region of the world" "will be borne entirely by the Pakistani government."

　　In Kabul, teachers and students of Kabul University and other colleges and schools, with the support of local residents, have held demonstrations against Pakistan. On March 30, mass demonstrations were held in front of the Pakistani and American embassies.

    阿富汗首相就巴克同尼斯坦问题发表声明
    新华社一日讯　喀布尔消息：阿富汗副首相兼外交大臣穆罕默德·纳伊姆汗三月三十日发表谈话说，阿富汗无意参加土耳其—伊拉克军事条约。他说，阿富汗坚决反对任何会使它脱离在世界事务方面的传统中立政策的行动。
    纳伊姆汗还说，他将率领包括七人的代表团出席即将召开的亚非会议。他认为亚非会议应设法加强参加会议的国家之间的经济和文化的联系。
    新华社一日讯　塔斯社喀布尔三月三十一日电：报纸登载了阿富汗首相萨达尔·穆罕默德·达乌德汗的一篇声明。声明评论巴基斯坦政府在把西巴基斯坦的各省各邦合并为单一的行政单位的同时，企图把接近阿富汗的伊努什图族聚居的地区包括进西巴基斯坦。
    大家都知道，阿富汗是主张建立独立的巴克同尼斯坦的。
    声明指出，“阿富汗政府一向没有承认、现在也不承认巴克同尼斯坦是巴基斯坦领土的一部分”，并且认为巴基斯坦的行动违反了巴克同尼斯坦人民决定他们的将来的愿望，这个行动的目的是要“取消我们的巴克同尼斯坦兄弟的自由和民族生存”。声明说：“阿富汗政府已经决定把这种侵略性的决定的不良后果通知巴基斯坦，并且提出抗议。”阿富汗首相着重指出，对于“危害世界这一地区的安宁和和平”的这种行动的全部责任“将完全由巴基斯坦政府担负”。
    在喀布尔，喀布尔大学和其他学院和学校的师生在当地居民的支持下，已经举行了反对巴基斯坦的示威游行。在三月三十日，在巴基斯坦和美国的大使馆前都举行了群众示威。
