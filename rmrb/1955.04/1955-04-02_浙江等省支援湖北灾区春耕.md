    Zhejiang and Other Provinces Support Hubei Disaster Area Spring Planting
    The spring plowing season has arrived, and workers on transportation lines everywhere are transporting large quantities of means of production and living materials to the disaster areas of Hubei.
    At the beginning of this year, the People's Government successively transferred more than 24 million jin of early rice seeds from Zhejiang, Hunan, and Jiangxi to support farmers in the areas of Hubei Province that suffered from floods last year in their spring plowing efforts. Thanks to the efforts of the staff of transportation departments in various places, these seeds have been transported to rural disaster areas before mid-March through long railway, highway and waterway transportation lines. As long as the transportation departments in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces heard that they were transporting spring plowing seeds to support the disaster areas in Hubei Province, they tried their best to arrange tools and give priority to shipment. The staff of Yueyang and Jiujiang transfer stations often worked sleeplessly all night in order to strive to transport the seeds back as soon as possible.
    In order to meet the needs of spring plowing power in the disaster areas of Hubei Province, a large number of draught cattle are being transported to the disaster areas from Henan, Hunan and other provinces via railways and waterways. More than 100 draught cattle supported by Hunan Province have all been transported. More than 4,000 draught cattle supported by Henan Province are being transported by train from Luohe, Zhumadian and other places to Hankou. (Ji Zhuoru)

    浙江等省支援湖北灾区春耕
    春耕季节来到了，各地运输线上的工人们，正把大批生产资料和生活资料运往湖北灾区。
    今年年初，人民政府便从浙江、湖南、江西各地陆续调运了两千四百多万斤早稻种子支援湖北省去年遭受水灾地区的农民进行春耕。这些种子在各地运输部门职工的努力下，已经通过漫长的铁路、公路和水路运输线，在三月中旬以前全部运送到灾区农村。湖南、江西省各运输部门只要听说是运送支援湖北省灾区的春耕种子，都尽量设法安排工具，优先启运。岳阳、九江转运站的职工们，为了争取早日把种子运回，经常通夜不眠地工作。
    为了满足湖北省灾区春耕畜力的需要，大批耕牛正由河南、湖南等省通过铁路和水路向灾区加紧运送。湖南省支援的一百多头耕牛已经全部运到。河南省支援的四千多头耕牛，正陆续从漯河、驻马店等地乘火车运到汉口。（纪卓如）
