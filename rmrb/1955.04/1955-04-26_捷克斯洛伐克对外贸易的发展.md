The Development of Czechoslovakia's Foreign Trade
Dvořák, Minister of Foreign Trade of Czechoslovakia

In the ten years since the glorious Soviet army liberated Czechoslovakia, the importance of foreign trade in the Czechoslovak economy has continuously grown. The recovery and development of post-war production has established a solid and broad foundation for foreign trade. Under the people's democratic system, the rapid growth of production achieved by our working people during the First Five-Year Plan from 1949 to 1953 exceeded the achievements of Czechoslovakia under the capitalist system in ten years. Socialist industrialization, with the development of heavy industry as its priority, is the main method of building socialism. The large scale of heavy industry and the production of means of production has opened the way for the development of other sectors of the national economy—light industry, the food industry, and agriculture—and has become a prerequisite for raising the people's living standards. It can now be said that the Czechoslovak Republic is already one of the most industrially developed countries.

Foreign trade, built on the solid foundation of industrial production, promotes the faster development of our entire economy and enables our country to utilize the high production capacity and surplus commodities of various industrial sectors to exchange for industrial raw materials, food, and manufactured goods that Czechoslovakia lacks in foreign markets. It is essential to take full advantage of the historically formed division of labor and the new socialist division of labor purposefully created by the democratic countries.

All the development processes up to now have confirmed the correctness of what Gottwald instructed in February 1950. He said:

“First, our industry must be turned to the production of goods that have permanent and stable sales markets for us, that is, first of all, to the production of heavy industry and heavy machinery industry products." Only in a people's democratic Czechoslovakia that has overthrown the capitalist system and gotten rid of the imperialist forces can this route be determined and realized.

Before the war, almost all of Czechoslovakia's foreign trade relied on capitalist countries. In 1933, the Soviet Union accounted for only 2.2 percent of Czechoslovakia's total imports, and only 1.3 percent of Czechoslovakia's total exports. This means that the development of Czechoslovakia's foreign trade mostly depended on the economic situation of the capitalist world. Market conditions and the ups and downs of crises were also reflected in the development and volume of Czechoslovakia's foreign trade. Therefore, the world economic crisis of 1929, which swept through all capitalist countries, also undermined the Czechoslovak economy and greatly limited Czechoslovakia's ability to engage in foreign trade.

After the end of the war, the development of foreign trade was still fraught with difficulties. Only after the nationalization of foreign trade in 1948 was it possible to implement unified management of imports and exports under the principles of benefiting the entire economy and its planned proportional development, to carry out purposeful trade policies, and to sign important trade agreements. Only on the basis of the nationalization of foreign trade was it possible to fully realize economic cooperation with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all other countries in the democratic camp.

In the development of economic relations with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, we wholeheartedly strive to achieve common progress. The development of this economic relationship has gradually increased the proportion of these countries in Czechoslovakia's foreign trade. Long-term agreements, including important import and export commodities, provide the economy with the necessary stability. The proportion of democratic countries in the total volume of Czechoslovakia's foreign trade has increased from 14 percent in 1947 to 46 percent in 1949; it increased to 61 percent in 1951; and further increased to 75 percent in 1953 and 1954. In recent years, our foreign trade institutions have helped other people's democratic countries develop their own industries and mechanize agriculture by supplying a large number of industrial equipment. Products of the Czechoslovak machine-building industry are regularly sold to the people's democratic countries.

In 1948, the supply of machinery and equipment accounted for 25.7 percent of Czechoslovakia's total exports; in later years, the supply volume increased greatly, reaching 50.8 percent of exports in 1953. The following facts prove our contribution to the construction cause in the people's democratic countries: In Poland, we put five power plants and two brick factories (each factory producing 15 million to 20 million bricks per year) into production, and supplied 32 mine excavators; in Bulgaria, we put two hydropower stations and two steam power plants built by our country into production; in Albania, three diesel power plants and one steam power plant are already generating electricity; in Romania, four power plants are already generating electricity; in Hungary, Czechoslovakia supplied machinery and equipment for the production of aluminum and the corresponding energy resources it needs. Czechoslovak industry also supported the construction of a huge railway and highway bridge over the Danube between Romania and Bulgaria by supplying metal structures.

In addition to supplying important machine-building components, Czechoslovakia also supplies diesel engines, trucks, tractors, heavy presses, machine tools, and products that Czechoslovakia did not produce before, such as dredgers, kinetic energy trains, newly constructed cranes, etc., to the Soviet Union and other countries in the peace and democracy camp. After these countries import commodities from the Czechoslovak Republic, they can largely satisfy their needs for various imported goods, which are supplied by various branches of the Czechoslovak industry.

Economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries has also guaranteed the supply of necessary raw materials, food, machinery, and other commodities to Czechoslovakia, enabling our industrial enterprises to work constantly and ensuring that our economy is not affected by crises in the capitalist world. Because the Czechoslovak Republic relies primarily on the Soviet Union and the various people's democratic countries, it has obtained true political and economic independence for the first time in history. The current economic development of the people's democratic countries opens up prospects for the further development of Czechoslovakia's foreign trade. This will lay the foundation for further deepening scientific and technological cooperation.

The exchange of goods with the People's Republic of China occupies an important position in Czechoslovakia's foreign trade. On June 14, 1950, the first agreement on the exchange of goods and payments between the Czechoslovak Republic and the People's Republic of China in 1950 was signed. In subsequent years, agreements on the exchange of goods and payments were also concluded.

The quantity of goods exchanged between our two countries is increasing year by year. In 1953, among the European people's democratic countries (excluding the German Democratic Republic) that traded with the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia ranked first in terms of total trade value, accounting for 29.5 percent. Compared with the agreement in 1950, the scale of goods exchanged this year has increased by more than 3.5 times.

Czechoslovakia's heavy industry, machine-building industry, and light industry provide the People's Republic of China with many important machines. These machines are necessary for the People's Republic of China in its national construction. Among them are complete sets of equipment for power stations, chemical plants, sugar factories, and film processing factories, as well as machine tools, diesel engines, water pumps, dredgers, cranes, diesel engines and gasoline engines, trucks, tractors, agricultural machinery, and mining, metallurgy, construction, and chemical industrial equipment, steel, telecommunications equipment, medical equipment, measuring instruments, and chemical and paper industry products. In terms of daily necessities, Czechoslovakia supplies the People's Republic of China with bicycles, textiles, radios, sugar, and others.

At the same time, the People's Republic of China supplies Czechoslovakia with raw materials needed for the textile, tanning, and chemical industries, raw materials for the metallurgical industry, such as various ores and non-ferrous metals. There are also many raw materials and foods for the food industry, primarily edible oil, oilseeds, eggs, tea, various roots, canned and frozen meat and fish products, southern fruits, candied fruits, dried candied fruits, tobacco leaves, and many other kinds of Chinese agricultural products.

The exchange of goods brings great benefits to the economies of our two brotherly countries, and it greatly benefits our progress toward the common goal of socialism. This exchange will continue to expand.

The Czechoslovak Industrial Exhibition held in Beijing will show the Chinese working people new products made by the Czechoslovak working people. It will surely enable the Chinese people to further understand the industrial development of Czechoslovakia. The quantity of products supplied by Czechoslovakia's industry to China's national economy will increase year by year, and the quality will improve year by year.

The continuous development of Czechoslovakia's trade with the socialist camp countries does not hinder the development of Czechoslovakia's foreign trade with other countries. Czechoslovakia has trade relations with almost all capitalist countries, and has also concluded trade agreements with most of them. The deepening of mutual relations between Czechoslovakia and the economically underdeveloped countries of Southeast Asia, the Near East and Middle East, Africa, and Latin America is of special significance. The development of the Czechoslovak Republic's industry enables us to help these countries industrialize, for example, by supplying these countries with various machines and complete sets of equipment. The Czechoslovak Republic also expresses its willingness to maintain and expand economic relations with economically developed capitalist countries. In 1954, Czechoslovakia's trade volume with Argentina increased by 162 percent compared with 1953, with Uruguay by 274 percent, with Indonesia by 300 percent, with Denmark by 168 percent, and with France by 50 percent.

The expanding capacity of the Czechoslovak market and the scale of Czechoslovak industry have created conditions for maintaining the balance of our foreign trade, but this is by no means achieved by restricting the volume of trade with price restrictions, but rather by constantly expanding the volume of trade based on the possibilities and needs of mutual exports and imports. The tasks of Czechoslovakia's foreign trade are of greater significance, and at the same time, because the realization of these tasks is related to spreading the idea of peaceful cooperation among countries around the world and the possibility of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social and economic systems, it is also of great international significance.

    捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易的发展
    捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易部部长　德沃夏克
    在光荣的苏军解放捷克斯洛伐克后的十年中，对外贸易在捷克斯洛伐克经济中的重要性不断地增长着。战后生产的恢复和发展，为对外贸易建立了稳固和广泛的基础。我国劳动人民在人民民主制度下，于一九四九——一九五三年的五年计划期间内所达到的生产的迅速增长，超过了资本主义制度下的捷克斯洛伐克在十年中所获得的成就。以发展重工业为首位的社会主义工业化是建设社会主义的主要方法。重工业和生产资料生产的强大规模，为发展国民经济的其他部门——轻工业、食品工业和农业开辟了道路，并成为提高人民生活水平的一个先决条件。现在可以说，捷克斯洛伐克共和国已经是工业最发达的国家之一了。
    建立在工业生产的稳固基础上的对外贸易，促使我国整个经济以更快的速度发展，并使我国能够利用工业各部门的高度生产能力和多余的商品在国外市场上换取为捷克斯洛伐克所缺乏的那些工业原料、食品和制成品。利用在历史上形成的劳动分工和由各民主国家有目的地所创造的新的社会主义分工所产生的全部利益，是很必要的。
    直到目前为止的全部发展进程，都证实了哥特瓦尔德在一九五○年二月所指示的正确性。他说：
  “首先要使我国工业转向这些货物的生产，那对我们有永久的、稳定的销售市场的货物，也就是说，首先要转向重工业和重机械工业产品的生产。”只有在推翻资本主义制度并摆脱了帝国主义势力的人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克，才能够确定并实现这个路线。
    战前，几乎整个捷克斯洛伐克的对外贸易都指望于资本主义各国。一九三三年在捷克斯洛伐克的进口总额中，苏联仅占百分之二点二，在捷克斯洛伐克出口总额中，苏联只占百分之一点三。这就是说，捷克斯洛伐克的对外贸易的发展大多依赖于资本主义世界的经济情况。市场情况和危机的起伏变化在捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易的发展和数量上也反映出来。因此，席卷了所有资本主义国家的一九二九年的世界经济危机，也破坏了捷克斯洛伐克的经济，并大大地限制了捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易的能力。
    战争结束以后，对外贸易的发展仍然是困难重重的。只是在一九四八年实行了对外贸易国有化以后，才可能在有利于整个经济和使其有计划地按比例发展的原则下，实行进出口的统一管理，才可能来进行有目的性的贸易政策，并签订重要的贸易协定。只是在实行对外贸易国有化的基础上，才有可能来充分实现同苏联、中华人民共和国和民主阵营所有其他国家的经济合作。
    在同苏联和各人民民主国家的经济关系的发展中，我们衷心地力求达到共同的高涨。这种经济关系的发展已使这些国家在捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易中的比重逐渐增加起来。包括重要的进出口货物的长期协定，使经济获得了必要的稳定性。在捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易的总量中，各民主国家所占的比重已由一九四七年的百分之十四增加到一九四九年的百分之四十六；一九五一年增加到百分之六十一；一九五三和一九五四年则更增加到百分之七十五。近年来，我国对外贸易机构以大量的工业设备供应帮助其他人民民主国家发展自己的工业和机械化农业。捷克斯洛伐克机器制造业的产品经常销售于各人民民主国家。
    一九四八年在捷克斯洛伐克的总的出口额中，机器和机器设备的供应占百分之二十五点七；在后来的几年中，供应量有了很大的增加，在一九五三年它们已达到出口的百分之五十点八。关于我们在各人民民主国家的建设事业中所作的贡献可由下列事实证明：在波兰，我们使五个发电厂和两个制砖工厂（每个厂年产一千五百万到两千万块砖）投入了生产，并供应了三十二部矿山采掘机；在保加利亚，我们曾使由我国建造的两座水力发电站和两所蒸汽发电厂投入生产；在阿尔巴尼亚，已经有三个柴油发电厂和一个蒸汽发电厂在发电；在罗马尼亚已有四座发电厂在发电；在匈牙利，捷克斯洛伐克供应了为生产铝及其相应需要的动力资源的机器设备。捷克斯洛伐克的工业并通过供应金属结构支援了在罗马尼亚和保加利亚之间多瑙河上建造巨大的铁路和公路桥梁的工程。
    除了供应重要的机器制造业的制件以外，捷克斯洛伐克还向苏联及和平民主阵营其他国家供应柴油发动机、载重汽车、拖拉机、重型压榨机、机床以及为捷克斯洛伐克以前所不生产的产品，如挖泥机、动能列车、新式构造的起重机等等。这些国家从捷克斯洛伐克共和国输入商品以后，就在很大程度上满足它们在各种进口货物上的需要，而这些货物正是捷克斯洛伐克工业的各种分支部门所供应的。
    同苏联和其他人民民主国家的经济合作，又保证了供应捷克斯洛伐克以必要的原料、食品、机器和其他商品，使我国各工业企业能够经常不断地工作，并保证我国经济不受资本主义世界危机的影响。由于捷克斯洛伐克共和国首先依靠了苏联以及各人民民主国家，使它在历史上第一次获得了真正的政治和经济的独立。各人民民主国家目前经济的发展为捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易的进一步发展开辟了远景。这样就能为进一步加深科学技术的合作建立基础。
    同中华人民共和国进行的货物交换，在捷克斯洛伐克的对外贸易中占着重要的地位。一九五○年六月十四日签订了第一个关于捷克斯洛伐克共和国和中华人民共和国一九五○年交换货物及付款的协定。在以后的几年中也缔结了关于交换货物及付款的协定。
    我们两国互相交换货物的数量在逐年增加。一九五三年，在同中华人民共和国进行贸易的欧洲各人民民主国家（德意志民主共和国除外）中，捷克斯洛伐克在贸易总值方面占第一位，即占百分之二十九点五。和一九五○年的协定相比，今年交换货物的规模已增加了三点五倍以上。
    捷克斯洛伐克的重工业、机器制造业和轻工业，供给中华人民共和国许多重要的机器。这些机器都是中华人民共和国在国家建设中所必需的。其中首先是发电站、化学工厂，制糖工厂，影片洗印厂的成套设备，其次是机床，柴油发动机，抽水机，挖泥机，起重机，柴油发动机和汽油发动机，载重汽车，拖拉机，农业机器，以及采矿业、冶金业、建筑业和化学工业的装备品，钢材，电讯设备，医疗器械，测量仪器，化学工业和造纸工业产品。在日用品方面，捷克斯洛伐克供应中华人民共和国以自行车、纺织品、无线电收音机、糖以及其他等等。
    同时，中华人民共和国供给捷克斯洛伐克以纺织、制革和化学工业所需的原料，冶金工业原料，例如各种矿石和有色金属。还有许多食品工业原料和食品，首先是食油、油籽、蛋品、茶叶、各种根须、肉类和鱼类的罐头和冷冻制品，南方的水果、蜜饯水果、蜜饯干果、烟叶及其他许多种中国农产品。
    商品的交换给我们两个兄弟国家的经济带来了巨大的好处，它大大地有利于我们向社会主义的共同目标迈进。这种交换将会日益扩大起来。
    在北京举行的捷克斯洛伐克工业展览会将向中国劳动人民展出捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民制出的新产品，它一定会使中国人民对捷克斯洛伐克的工业发展得到进一步的了解，捷克斯洛伐克的工业供给中国国民经济的产品，数量会一年比一年更多、质量会一年比一年更好。
    捷克斯洛伐克同社会主义阵营各国贸易的不断发展，并不妨碍捷克斯洛伐克同其他国家对外贸易的发展。捷克斯洛伐克几乎同所有的资本主义国家都有着贸易关系，并且还同其中的大多数国家缔结了贸易协定。捷克斯洛伐克同经济上不够发达的东南亚、近东和中东、非洲和拉丁美洲国家的相互关系的深入开展，具有特殊的意义。捷克斯洛伐克共和国工业的发展，使我们可以帮助这些国家实行工业化，例如，可以供给这些国家以各种机器和全套装备。捷克斯洛伐克共和国同时也表示愿意同经济发达的资本主义国家保持并扩大经济关系。一九五四年，捷克斯洛伐克对阿根廷的贸易额较一九五三年增加了百分之一百六十二，对乌拉圭增加了百分之二百七十四，对印度尼西亚增加了百分之三百，对丹麦增加了百分之一百六十八，对法国增加了百分之五十。
    日益扩大的捷克斯洛伐克市场的容量和捷克斯洛伐克工业的规模，为保持我国对外贸易的平衡创造了条件，但是这决不是用以价格限制贸易量的办法来取得的，相反，而是根据彼此之间输出和输入的可能和需要、在不断扩大贸易量的基础上取得的。捷克斯洛伐克的对外贸易的任务具有更为巨大的意义，同时又因为这些任务的实现是同传播世界各国和平合作的思想、是同社会制度和经济制度不同的国家和平共处的可能性相联系的，所以，它也就具有重大的国际意义。
