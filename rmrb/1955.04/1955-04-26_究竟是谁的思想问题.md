Whose Ideological Problem Is It After All?
Chen Hongxiang
I was originally a student in the Telecommunications Group of the Electrical Engineering Department of Tangshan Railway Institute. The main courses I studied at school were railway communication equipment. After graduating in the summer of 1952, I and other telecommunications graduates from universities were assigned to work in the Broadcasting Affairs Bureau. Among them, fifty or sixty people were assigned to the Capital Construction Department of the bureau, and I was assigned to the Planning Section of the Capital Construction Department. Because there was really no work to do in this section, I and four other classmates were idle all day long. During this period (from October to the end of the year), I asked the leadership to study our work problems, but I never received any response.

We were so idle that Ma Zengling and two others went to the Beijing Library to find information every day, without any specific content or plan; Yu Wanxiang and I read the official documents from various local radio stations to our bureau in the past, trying to find something to do from them; but still we couldn't find any work to do. For this reason, I also reported this situation to the former Central Personnel Department, requesting a solution, but to no avail.

In early 1953, the organizational structure of the bureau changed, and I was transferred to the Comprehensive Technology Section of the Design Department. But the work we did here was nothing more than binding drawings, copying, translating, and purchasing, and the rest of the office hours were still idle. Later, the construction of radio stations began, and the leadership sent me and Ma Zengling to do site exploration work. After that, we either went to the Urban Planning Commission to ask for land, asked the power plant for electricity, collected design materials (including information on the performance and origin of bricks, wood, sand, etc., and the styles of flush toilets); or we led people to the Central University for Nationalities and Peking University in Beijing to photograph so-called "national style" buildings, or to understand the conditions of the upper and lower water pipes near the site, and so on. Of course, such work is important, but it is obviously inappropriate to have a few telecommunications college students who neither understand civil engineering nor geological drilling do it. Therefore, although I tried my best to complete the tasks assigned by the superiors, I still put forward my own opinions. I said, "This is asking us to abandon our proper occupations." Unexpectedly, for this sentence, the leaders of the department gave me a lot of criticism.

In this situation, I had to work in silence. From 1953 to early 1955, I was either in this city or in other cities, doing radio station site selection work. This is a comprehensive and complex work involving various technical specialties such as civil engineering, geological drilling, sanitary engineering, power, and telecommunications. In the Soviet Union and some departments in our country, specialized committees composed of experienced technical personnel from all fields are responsible for this; but the Broadcasting Affairs Bureau entrusted this work to us, these telecommunications college students who had just graduated from school. Since it is impossible for one or two of us to master so much specialized technical knowledge, we can not only not correctly solve the site selection problem, but also not solve any technical problems encountered in the work. As a result, we have to do some administrative work, contacting this unit today, negotiating with that unit tomorrow, copying information, and understanding the situation. Although we are also working hard, the effect will certainly not be good. The leadership did not check the organizational structure and staffing responsible for site selection, but believed that it was because we were not dedicated to our work.

In early 1954, based on my work experience over the past year, I again gave my opinions to the former Central Personnel Department and went to talk to them several times in person. However, the Personnel Department simply forwarded my report to the Personnel Section of our bureau and did not make further inquiries. One day, Wu Xiting, the section chief of the Cadre Section of the Personnel Section, talked to me. He was also surprised how I was assigned to the Broadcasting Affairs Bureau and promised to study the matter. But soon, I went to see Zhang Wenzhu, the secretary of the section, who said, "The Personnel Section has already forwarded your report. Director Dong said that the work requires it and it is not possible to transfer you." Immediately afterwards, Zhang Ge, the secretary of the General Branch of the Communist Youth League, also talked to me, saying, "You are not as active and promising as when you first came to the bureau. Now you are considering personal issues. I hope you can focus on your work. Work is not something that will never change." He also said, "It is possible to raise opinions to a higher level, but the problem is whether your department is willing to let you go! I hope you can analyze the motive for writing the report." I was depressed for several days because of this matter. Could it be said that striving to do work that I am familiar with and closer to what I have learned is an impure motive? I found it hard to understand. But I still restrained myself and tried my best to do my job well.

Because I had made many suggestions before and after, and I also reviewed my professional knowledge and read telecommunications books in my spare time, my comrades also thought that I was not dedicated to my work and criticized my learning as not being practical. May I ask, what should my profession be?

Soon, the organizational structure changed again, and Ma Zengling and two section chiefs (both telecommunications technicians) were transferred to the Survey Section of the Capital Construction Department, and the content of the work remained unchanged. This continued until July 1954, when section chief Li Xiaoxu suddenly mobilized me to change my career to surveying, specializing in measuring the latitude and longitude of sites. He said, "Radio stations need people who can measure latitude and longitude. You are a college graduate, you have culture, and you can learn anything. You often work with the surveying team, and it is very suitable for you to learn surveying. Ma Zengling will learn engineering geology. In the future, when our bureau has you, the survey can be done without relying on foreign aid." I disagreed with this approach. I said, "It is a separatist idea for each unit to do its own thing and not seek foreign aid; and even if we learn it, we cannot but rely on foreign aid. At the same time, the number of radio stations built each year is limited, and it only takes a week to measure the latitude and longitude of a construction site. May I ask how many days a person can work in a year?" But he said, "Now there are many people studying telecommunications and few people studying surveying. The state does not give us these technical personnel, so we have to let you change careers. You should obey the needs of the state, and I hope you will consider it carefully." Although I did not agree to change my career, I still took the time to learn surveying. Later, I don't know why, the department never mentioned the issue again.

Recently, the Survey Section was divided into the Survey and Drilling Section and the Survey Group, and Ma Zengling and I were transferred to the Survey Group, and the work remained the same. Perhaps due to long-term experience, more and more people are finding that the work allocation is unreasonable. Our former section chief Li Xiaoxu, deputy section chief Wang Jiabao, and us, in the name of the section, submitted a written opinion during the reorganization, requesting a reconsideration of the organizational structure and staffing. Although the department held a meeting of section and group leaders to discuss this issue, the department chief's meeting finally decided to maintain the original decision.

Recently, I have become idle again. I discussed with Zhang Lei, the deputy director of the Design Department, whether my work could be adjusted. He did not indicate whether it was possible, but only asked me, "Which section of the Design Department do you think is suitable for you? In the future, when we need to build iron towers, how about you learning iron towers (iron towers belong to the steel structure specialty of the civil engineering department)?" I said, "Why must we consider it within this department? Why can't we consider transferring me out of the department or out of the bureau?" He smiled and dismissed it, still hoping that I could consider it within the department.

In the past two and a half years, I have made many suggestions and received a lot of criticism; but the problem has not been solved until today. This phenomenon of unreasonable use of cadres is not uncommon in our bureau. For example, in the Sanitary Engineering Section of the Design Department, four technicians are graduates of the telecommunications department of the university. The work they are currently engaged in, in addition to vacuum tube cooling, also involves upper and lower water pipes and heating and ventilation. In the Power Section, except for the section chief, eight technicians are all studying telecommunications. It is precisely because of improper allocation and use that the phenomenon of wasted work is relatively common: when the Broadcasting Studio Line Section ordered the 1955 plan at the end of 1954, due to the small number of tasks, the utilization rate of university students was only 52%. Wang Chengming and three others from the Survey and Drilling Section were sent to the Ministry of Railways to learn drilling and testing, planning to establish their own drilling team and laboratory. By the time they returned from their studies and the equipment was purchased, it was decided not to establish it due to the principle of streamlining; these four comrades have been wasted for a year (five months were spent learning drilling and testing, and seven months were spent idle). During this period, they were also asked to bind drawings, which is said to be better than being idle!

I would like to ask, in the period when the country's large-scale construction began, is it the ideological problem of us graduates or their ideological problem that the Broadcasting Affairs Bureau allows so many college graduates to "abandon their proper occupations"?

    究竟是谁的思想问题
    陈鸿翔
    我原是唐山铁道学院电机系电讯组的学生，在学校里学习的主要课程是铁路上的通讯设备。一九五二年暑期毕业后，我和其他大学电讯系毕业的同学一道，被分配在广播事业局工作。其中有五、六十人被分配在该局基本建设处，我被分配在基本建设处的计划科。由于这个科确实没有什么工作可做，我和另外四个同学便整天闲着。在这期间（从十月到年底），我曾请求领导方面研究一下我们的工作问题，可是一直没有得到反应。
      我们闲得实在没办法，马增龄等三人每天到北京图书馆去找资料，既无一定内容，又无计划；我和喻万祥则翻阅过去各地方电台给我局的公文，想从这里面找出一些可做的事情；但依旧找不到什么
  工作可做。为此，我还曾把这情况反映给前中央人事部，请求解决，也无结果。
        一九五三年初，局的组织机构变动了，我又被调到设计处综合技术科。但我们在这里所做的工作不外是装订图纸、抄写、翻译和采购之类，其余的办公时间还是闲着。后来，建台工作开始了，领导方面把我和马增龄派去做台址勘察工作。这以后，我们不是去向都市计划委员会要土地，向电厂要电，搜集设计资料（包括关于砖、木、砂石等的性能、产地和抽水马桶的式样等等的资料）；就是领人到北京中央民族学院、北京大学去拍摄所谓“民族形式”建筑物的照片，或了解场地附近上下水道情况等等。诸如此类的工作当然都是重要的，但是让几个既不懂土木建筑工程，又不懂地质钻探的学电讯的大学生去做，显然是不合适的。所以，我虽然尽力完成了上级交给我的任务，但我仍然提出了自己的意见。我说：“这是要我们不务正业。”没想到，为了这句话，处的领导同志给了我许多批评。
    在这种情况下，我只好不声不响地工作了。从一九五三年到一九五五年初，不是在本市，就是在外埠，搞电台台址选择工作。这是一项包括土木建筑、地质钻探、卫生工程、电力、电讯等各种技术专业的综合而复杂的工作，苏联以及我国有些部门，都是由各方面的有经验的技术人员组成专门委员会来负责；但广播事业局却把这件工作交给我们这些刚从学校出来的、学电讯的大学生去做。由于我们一两个人决不可能掌握这许多专门技术知识，所以不仅不能正确地解决台址选择问题，而且也不可能解决工作中遇到的任何技术问题，结果只好做些行政事务工作，今天和这个单位联系，明天跟那个单位协商，抄资料，了解情况。虽然我们也是努力地工作，但效果当然不会好的。领导方面不从对负责台址选择工作的组织机构和人员配备上去检查，还认为是我们不安心工作所致。
    在一九五四年初，我曾根据一年来的工作经验又给前中央人事部提出意见，并亲自去谈了几次。可是人事部只是把我的报告转给我局人事处，便不再作进一步的了解了。一天，人事处干部科长吴溪亭找我谈话，他也奇怪怎么会把我分配到广播事业局来，答应研究处理。可是不久，我去找处秘书张文翥，他说：“人事处已经把你的报告转来了。董处长说，工作需要，不能调动。”紧接着，团总支书记张戈也找我谈话，说：“你不像刚来局时那样积极有为了，现在在考虑个人问题了。希望你能安心工作。工作不是一辈子不改变的。”又说：“越级提意见是可以的，但问题在于本部门肯放你呀！希望你分析一下写报告的动机。”为了这件事，我苦闷了好几天。难道说，为了争取做自己熟悉的和比较接近自己所学的业务的工作，就是动机不纯吗？我很难想通。但我仍克制自己，尽力做好工作。
    由于我前后提过不少次意见，所以我空闲时温习温习业务，看看电讯书籍，同志们就也认为我是不安心工作，批评我的学习不结合实际。试问，我的业务应该是什么呢？
    不久，组织机构又变了，我和马增龄以及二位科长（均为电讯技术员）又被调到基本建设处勘察科，工作内容仍没有改变。这样一直到一九五四年七月，科长李孝勖又突然动员我改行去搞测量，专门测量场地的经纬度。他说：“电台需要测量经纬度的人材。你是大学毕业生，有文化，学什么都行。你经常和测量队一起工作，学测量很合适。马增龄去学工程地质。将来我们局有了你们，勘察就可以不依靠外援了。”我不同意这种作法。我说：“每个单位都自搞一套，不求外援，这是分散主义思想；而且，即或我们学会了，也不能不依靠外援。同时，电台每年建设数量有限，测一个工地的经纬度不过要一个星期的时间，试问一人一年能有几天在工作呢？”但他说：“现在学电讯的人多，学勘察的人少，国家不给我们这些技术人员，只好让你们改行。你应当服从国家的需要，希望你再仔细考虑考虑。”我虽然没有答应改行，但仍然抽空学测量，以后也不知为什么，处里又不再提这个问题了。
    最近，勘察科分为测量钻探科和勘察组，我和马增龄被调到勘察组，还是原来的工作。也许是由于长期体验的结果，发现工作分配不合理的人越来越多了，我们的前任科长李孝勖、副科长王家宝和我们，以科的名义在改组时曾提出一个书面意见，要求重新考虑这个组织机构和人员配备的问题；处里虽然召开了一次科组长会议，对这一问题作了讨论，可是处长会议最后决定：仍维持原议。
    最近我又闲起来了，我和设计处张磊副处长商量，是否能调整一下我的工作，他未表示可否，只问我：“你看设计处那一科对你合适？将来需要建设铁塔，你去学铁塔（铁塔属于土木系钢结构专业）怎么样？”我说：“为什么一定要在本处考虑呢？为什么不可以考虑把我调出处或调出局去呢？”他一笑置之，还是希望我能在处里考虑。
    二年半来，我提了不少意见，也挨了不少批评；但问题直到今天还没有解决。这种不合理使用干部的现象在我们局里是不少的，如设计处卫生工程科有四个技术员是大学电讯系毕业的，他们现在担任的工作，除了真空管冷却，还搞上下水道，暖气通风。在电力科，除了科长，有八位技术员都是学电讯的。正因为分配使用不当，窝工现象也比较普遍：播音室线路科在一九五四年底订一九五五年计划时，由于任务少，大学生的使用率只达百分之五十二。测量钻探科的王承明等四人被派往铁道部学钻探和化验，打算自己成立钻探队、化验室。等到他们学习回来，设备也购好了；但由于考虑到现在有精简的原则，最近又决定不成立了；这四位同志已被浪费了一年（五个月是在学钻探、化验，七个月是闲着）的光阴。其间还让他们去装订图纸，据说这比闲着好！
    我想问一问，在国家大规模建设开始的时期，广播事业局让这许多高等学校毕业生“不务正业”，究竟是我们这些毕业生的思想问题，还是他们的思想问题？
