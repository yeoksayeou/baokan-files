The Asian-African Conference has been going on for two days, and starting from the 20th, it will enter the stage of group meetings.

In these two days, apart from a few delegations such as India, the twenty-three delegations expected to speak at the plenary session have all expressed their opinions; the media is already analyzing the progress of the conference.

Generally speaking, most observers here believe that there are many similarities in the opinions expressed at the conference. The opening speech by Indonesian President Sukarno and the speech by Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo as the chairman of the conference at the first meeting have given people a deep impression.

In the speeches of other delegations, the vast majority pointed out to varying degrees that colonialism is an important root cause of today's world unrest, and that in Asia and Africa, colonialism remains to be finally eliminated. Many delegations emphasized the importance of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, respect for the territorial sovereignty and integrity of other countries, and the right of each country to freely choose its political and economic system. Many also advocated that the Five Principles should become the principles governing relations between countries... Here, no one opposes economic and cultural exchanges between countries, and there is no place for atomic maniacs...

However, judging from the situation inside and outside the conference in the past two days, people have also noticed some countercurrents, namely the obstruction and sabotage activities of American colonialists. For the representatives of Wall Street, it would be best if the Asian-African Conference could not be held. If it is held, they will create disputes to make it end unhappily. It is said that a large number of people who came here from across the Pacific under the guise of journalists but are not actually journalists are engaged in activities aimed at the above objectives. As the Indonesian "People's Daily" editorial on the 20th said, "They (the Americans) are trying to influence the representatives of small and medium-sized countries, to make them believe that their enemy is not colonialism but communism."

On the afternoon of the first day of the conference, the chief representative of Iraq, Jamali, delivered a speech. In his speech, in addition to talking about opposing "colonialism of the old era" and Greater Zionism, he also slandered communism as "new colonialism." Some American "journalists" in the hallways of the venue were glad that contradictions had emerged in the conference. Some even complimented the Iraqi representative for "taking the initiative." However, most people felt dissatisfied with Jamali's slanderous attacks, which were not conducive to the conference achieving its goals. Even the "Eternal Daily" of the Masjumi Party here said that the representative's anti-communist remarks were quite surprising to the participants.

On April 19, the second day of the conference, people heard speeches from the representatives of the Philippines and Turkey discussing political ideas and distorting historical facts. Later, the representative of Thailand, in his speech, mentioned the Dai Autonomous Region in southwestern China and the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese in China, as if this constituted a threat to Thailand.

After the Thai representative spoke, Premier Zhou, in addition to distributing the main speech in writing, made a supplementary speech. He clearly expressed the position of the delegation of the People's Republic of China to seek common ground while reserving differences, and answered the main questions raised by people in a short period of more than ten minutes. "The Chinese delegation is here to seek unity, not to quarrel." "The Chinese delegation is here to seek common ground, not to create differences. Is there a basis for seeking common ground among us? Yes. That is, the vast majority of Asian and African countries and peoples have suffered from the disasters and pains caused by colonialism since modern times, and are still suffering from them. This is what we all acknowledge. By finding a common ground in relieving the pain and disasters of colonialism, it will be easy for us to understand and respect each other, sympathize with and support each other, rather than suspect and fear each other, exclude and oppose each other."... People in the venue listened attentively; after the meeting, I saw representatives of some countries shake hands and congratulate Premier Zhou; some Western and Eastern journalists told me how the sincerity, gentleness, solemnity, and persuasive attitude of the head of the Chinese delegation were admired by people. The Indonesian newspapers on the 20th also praised Premier Zhou's efforts to avoid sharpening the situation and create an atmosphere in which Asian and African nations could understand each other.

Of course, the Asian-African Conference is still going on, and the obstruction and sabotage activities of the US imperialists will definitely continue. But there is no reason to be pessimistic.

Isn't every delegation grateful to the government and people of Indonesia for their enthusiasm for the conference? They should notice that Bandung seems to be in a grand festival for these two days. From morning to night, the streets are crowded with people cheering and congratulating the success of the Asian-African Conference. Radio broadcasts telegrams of congratulations from various organizations such as workers, youth, women, teachers, and veterans from all over Indonesia, expressing their ardent hope for the success of the conference in the cause of striving for peace and friendly cooperation between nations.

Here is a story from the Indonesian Antara News Agency: Some Western journalists who had participated in the Southeast Asia Defense Treaty meetings held in Manila and Bangkok last autumn and this spring inadvertently revealed a feeling: the people of Bandung were extremely interested in this conference, while the people of Manila and Bangkok were very indifferent to that conference. So they went to investigate the motives of those Bandung citizens who were cheering on the streets; the answers they got were all because this conference would be beneficial to close cooperation and peace between countries. But who doesn't know that the Manila and Bangkok conferences divided Asian countries into military blocs to facilitate the US imperialists' realization of the conspiracy of "Asians fighting Asians"? That's why the people were so indifferent to it, opposed it, and treated the Asian-African Conference so enthusiastically.

The people welcome the Asian-African Conference, and the people look forward to its achievements.
                        April 20th, Bandung

### 亚非会议的头两天

    亚非会议的头两天
    本报记者　吴文焘
    亚非会议已经开过两天，从二十日起，就要进入小组会议阶段了。
    两天里，除了印度等几个代表团以外，预计要在全体大会上讲话的二十三个代表团都发表了自己的意见；舆论界已在分析会议的进程了。
    总的来说，这里大多数的观察家都认为会上的意见多有相同之处；印度尼西亚总统苏加诺的开幕词和总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约作为大会主席在第一次会议上的讲话，首先就给了人们以深刻的印象。
    在其他代表团的发言中，绝大多数都在一定程度上指出殖民主义是今天世界不安的重要根源，而且在亚非两洲，殖民主义还有待于最后肃清。很多代表团强调不干涉别国内政、尊重别国的领土主权的完整、以及每个国家有权来自由选择其政治经济制度的重要性，也有很多代表主张五项原则应当成为国与国间关系的原则……这里大家都不反对各国间的经济与文化交流，这里没有原子狂人的地位……。
    可是，从两天的会内外的情况看，人们也注意到一些逆流，那就是美国殖民主义者的阻挠与破坏活动。对于华尔街的代表们来说，亚非会议最好是开不成，如果开成了，他们就制造纠纷，使它不欢而散。据说，从太平洋彼岸来这里的大批名为记者实非记者的人，就是为了上述目标而活动的。正像二十日印度尼西亚“人民日报”社论所说的，“他们（美国人）试图影响中小国家的代表们，要他们相信他们的敌人不是殖民主义而是共产主义。”
    在大会第一天的下午，伊拉克的首席代表贾马利发表了演说。在讲话中，他除了谈论反对“旧时代的殖民主义”、大犹太主义等外，还污蔑共产主义为“新的殖民主义”。会场走廊上的一些美国
  “记者”庆幸会议里的矛盾显露出来了。有人甚至恭维伊拉克的代表“掌握了主动权”。可是，多数人对贾马利的这种不利于会议完成其目标的污蔑性攻击感觉并不是满意的。连这里马斯友美党的“永恒报”也说这位代表的反共言论颇使与会者吃惊。
    在四月十九日、大会的第二天，人们听到了菲律宾和土耳其代表讨论政治思想、歪曲历史事实的发言。后来泰国代表在他的讲话里，提到我国西南傣族自治区和我国华侨的双重国籍问题，好像这就构成了对泰国的威胁。
    在泰国代表发言之后，周总理除用书面分发了主要发言外，又作了补充发言。他异常鲜明地表示了中华人民共和国代表团求同存异的立场，在短短的十余分钟内回答了人们提出的主要问题。“中国代表团是来求团结而不是来吵架的。”“中国代表团是来求同而不是来立异的。在我们中间有无求同的基础呢？有的。那就是亚非绝大多数国家和人民自近代以来都曾经受过、并且现在仍在受着殖民主义所造成的灾难和痛苦。这是我们大家都承认的。从解除殖民主义痛苦和灾难中找共同基础，我们就很容易互相了解和尊重、互相同情和支持，而不是互相疑虑和恐惧、互相排斥和对立。”……会场上人们屏息凝神地听着；在散会后，我看到一些国家的代表和周总理握手致贺；一些西方和东方的记者告诉我中国代表团团长的诚恳、温和、严正、以理服人的态度如何受到人们的景仰。二十日的印度尼西亚报纸也对于周总理的努力不使情势尖锐化、并创造使亚非各民族得以互相谅解的气氛予以赞扬。
    当然，亚非会议还在进行着，美帝国主义者的阻挠、破坏活动还一定会继续下去的。但是没有可以令人悲观的理由。
    不是每个代表团都感谢印度尼西亚政府和人民对于会议的热心吗？他们应当注意到这两天万隆似乎处在盛大的节日里。从早到晚，街道上拥挤着欢呼祝贺亚非会议成功的人群。无线电广播着印度尼西亚全国工人、青年、妇女、教师、退伍军人等各种组织的贺电，热望大会在争取和平和各民族间友好合作事业上的成功。
    有这样一个故事来自印度尼西亚的安塔拉通讯社：一些曾经参加过去秋和今春在马尼拉与曼谷举行的东南亚防御公约会议的西方记者，无意中表露出他们的一种感觉：万隆的人们对于这次会议极感兴趣，而马尼拉和曼谷的人们对于那次会议则是十分冷淡。于是他们就去调查那些夹道欢呼的万隆市民的动机了；他们得到的回答，都是说因为这次会议将对各国之间的紧密合作与和平有利。但谁不知道马尼拉、曼谷会议是将亚洲国家分为军事集团，以便利美帝国主义者实现以“亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋呢？这就是为什么人民那样冷淡它，反对它，而这样热情地对待亚非会议。
    人民欢迎亚非会议，人民期待着它的成就。
                        四月二十日于万隆
