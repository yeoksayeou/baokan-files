Adopting Concrete Measures to Strengthen Publicity on Party Life
——The Experience of Shanxi Daily in Strengthening Publicity on Party Life
Bai Ruyuan

Strengthening publicity on Party life is one of the primary tasks of Party committee newspapers at all levels. In the past, publicity in this area by newspapers in various regions was generally weak; many newspapers even made erroneous publicity that ran counter to Party principles, such as exaggerating individual roles, spreading individual worship, localism, and decentralism. Since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, the publicity on Party life in newspapers in various regions has improved compared to the past, and some experience has been accumulated. Shanxi Daily is one of them.

Since the establishment of the "Party Life" column in Shanxi Daily in 1950, although there have been certain achievements in publicity about Party life, due to an insufficiently clear understanding of the guiding principles and tasks of Party life publicity, the following shortcomings existed: the scope of publicity and reporting was narrow, especially with very little publicity and reporting on the Party's ideological and organizational construction; insufficient effort was made to closely integrate with reality to report on the implementation of the Party's resolutions and the activities of Party organizations; there were few commentaries on the Party's work and life; and the forms of publicity and reporting were monotonous and not lively enough.

After the editorial department of Shanxi Daily checked and recognized these shortcomings in the third quarter of 1954, it took various measures to improve them, and has achieved relatively significant results. First, the scope of publicity and reporting has been expanded compared to the past, and publicity and reporting on Party building has increased. For example, the articles published in November 1954 reflected the following aspects: implementing the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party; developing Party members; the Party's leadership of industrial work; the Party's leadership of the unified purchase work; the Party's leadership of the Communist Youth League; and there were also small columns reporting on the activities of Party organizations in various regions. Second, attention was paid to expounding the Party's principles in conjunction with reality. For example, in November and December 1954, the central task of Shanxi Province was the unified purchase of grain, cotton, and oil crops. At that time, many Party organizations relaxed their political and ideological leadership over this work, which affected the completion of the task. Shanxi Daily published an editorial on November 24 entitled "Doing a Good Job in the Party's Political and Ideological Work is a Guarantee for Completing the Unified Purchase Task," and published a typical report on "The Lessons of the CCP Linyi County Committee Neglecting Political and Ideological Work," fully explaining that strengthening political and ideological leadership over this work is the primary responsibility of Party organizations. Third, commentary work has been strengthened compared to the past. Taking October 1954 as a boundary, in the six months before this, Shanxi Daily only published two editorials and one short commentary on Party life; in the two months of October and November 1954, five editorials and four short commentaries were published. Fourth, the forms of publicity and reporting have become more diversified; since October 1954, the writing forms used in the newspaper have included editorials, articles, communications, news, features, short commentaries, and letters from Party members, and small columns such as "Activities of Party Organizations" and special pages on a certain issue related to Party life have also been organized.

The achievements made by Shanxi Daily in the publicity of Party life are inseparable from the strengthening of the leadership of the editorial board of Shanxi Daily and the improvement of the work of the Party Life Group.

The newspaper editorial board's emphasis on and strengthening of leadership in Party life publicity is very important; because only when the newspaper editorial board regards strengthening Party life publicity as one of the primary tasks of the newspaper and effectively strengthens the specific leadership of the work of the Party Life Group can the weak state of Party life publicity in the past be changed. The experience of Shanxi Daily proves this point. When the editorial board of Shanxi Daily studied the improvement work in the third quarter of 1954 according to the Central Committee's decision on improving newspaper work, it first focused on strengthening Party life publicity, combined with the study of the experience of Soviet newspaper work, and checked the newspaper's past publicity and reporting on Party life. In the process of studying documents and checking work, they focused on solving the following two problems from the perspective of understanding: one was the task, characteristics, and differences between Party life publicity and other aspects of publicity. Some comrades believed that since all publicity and reporting in the Party newspaper must have Party spirit, must publicize and implement the Party's general line, Party policies, and resolutions, and must publicize the Party's leadership role, then whether it is necessary to particularly emphasize Party life publicity. The reason why they had this understanding was mainly because they did not understand the task and characteristics of Party life publicity. The editorial board of Shanxi Daily led the editorial department in discussions. In the discussion, everyone realized that one of the important differences between the Party committee newspaper and other newspapers led by the Party is that the Party committee newspaper has a Party Life Group (other newspapers do not have this group), which is responsible for comprehensively and systematically publicizing and reporting on the activities of Party organizations. The Party Life Group and other groups of the editorial department must publicize and implement the Party's line and policies; but its task is to publicize and report on the life and work of Party organizations, that is, to publicize and report on the ideological and organizational construction of Party organizations themselves, to elaborate on the Party's principles and major issues in Party life, to publicize and report on the Party organizations' political leadership of economic and cultural work, and political work and organizational work for the people; and to achieve the purpose of consolidating and uniting the Party, educating Party members, and promoting the work of Party organizations through these publicity reports. Obviously, these tasks are very important and cannot be included and replaced by the work of other groups.

Another issue is the relationship between Party life publicity and other aspects of newspaper publicity, especially economic publicity. In the discussion, some comrades raised the issue of whether the newspaper should take Party life publicity or economic publicity as the center and primary task of publicity in the future. The raising of this question reflected the neglect of some comrades on the Party's leadership role in economic construction, and the principle that the Party's life publicity in newspapers cannot be separated from real life, especially the country's economic construction, for publicity. After discussion, everyone further clarified that because the implementation and realization of the Party's general line in the transition period and the country's first five-year plan is the general task of all the people of our country, and because the publicity of Party life in newspapers must be closely combined with the Party's and the country's struggle tasks, therefore, publicizing the Party's general line in the transition period and mobilizing the people to complete the country's first five-year plan is the newspaper's regular central task, and strengthening the publicity of Party life is an important part of this task.

After the editorial board of Shanxi Daily unified the understanding of the editorial department, it formulated a work plan on strengthening Party life reporting and Marxist-Leninist theory publicity, clearly stipulating the guiding principles, tasks, and reporting methods of Party life publicity. At the same time, it strengthened the staffing of the Party Life Group, and according to the instructions of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, one of the members of the editorial board was appointed as the leader of the Party Life Group, and the strength within the group was enriched. In this way, a solid ideological and organizational foundation was laid for strengthening the newspaper's Party life publicity.

In order to strengthen the publicity of Party life, the newspaper editorial board must also pay constant attention to and provide concrete guidance to the work of the Party Life Group, that is, take concrete measures to help the comrades of the Party Life Group go deep into reality and deep into the masses, and improve the work of the Party Life Group by improving the level of cadres. During this period, Shanxi Daily mainly adopted the following practices: In order to improve the quality of manuscripts and open up sources of manuscripts, the Party Life Group adopted the working method of integrating editing and collecting, and promptly and frequently sent people to go deep into the lower levels. After implementing this method, in the two months of October and November 1954, most of the comrades in the group went to the countryside, which guaranteed the completion of the task of interviewing and organizing manuscripts. The aforementioned article "The Lessons of the CCP Linyi County Committee Neglecting Political and Ideological Work," which played a greater role in the current work, was jointly written by reporters sent by the newspaper and comrades from the local reporter station after a thorough understanding of the situation. When writing important commentaries, after the topic was determined, the group would collectively discuss it or send people to investigate, and then write according to the discussion results or investigation and research results. The editorial "We Must Pay Attention to the Education and Examination of Probationary Party Members," published on October 28, 1954, was written after sending people to investigate and after discussion within the group. At the end of 1954, the editorial department of Shanxi Daily held a forum for readers of the Party Life column within the editorial department, and at the same time sent people to Yuci and other places to widely investigate readers' opinions through individual interviews and forums. The editorial department conducted research based on the opinions of the readers, and realized that the newspaper had strengthened the publicity of Party life, and had been welcomed by Party organizations at all levels and the broad masses of Party members; however, the scope of publicity and reporting was still narrow and could not meet the objective needs; in addition, it was still not doing enough to promptly propose, explain, and solve important issues in Party life, so the role played by Party life publicity in actual work was not large enough. Adopting this method of contacting the masses to timely understand the publicity effect of the newspaper is very useful for the editorial department to further improve its work.

The Party Life column in the Party committee newspaper is also an important tool for the Party committee to connect with Party organizations at all levels and educate all Party members, so the Party committee must attach great importance to and take various measures to strengthen the publicity of Party life in the newspaper. The leadership of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee of the CCP on the publicity of Party life in Shanxi Daily is that the Standing Committee discusses and approves the newspaper's monthly plan for editorials on Party life, important special report plans, and quarterly publicity points. The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee decided that one of the secretaries should regularly lead the newspaper work. The various departments of the Party committee, such as the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee and the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Provincial Party Committee, have also been more concerned about and supportive of Shanxi Daily's strengthening of Party life publicity during this period. Shanxi Daily has also established closer ties with Party organizations at all levels through reporter stations in various places. In order to further improve the publicity of Party life in Shanxi Daily, the CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee made a decision on improving Shanxi Daily and Shanxi Peasant Daily at the end of 1954. In addition to requiring the editorial department of Shanxi Daily to report to the Provincial Party Committee every six months on the status and problems of Party life publicity, it also required Party organizations at all levels to regularly care for and actively help the newspaper editorial department to do a good job in the publicity of Party life, and made several specific provisions on how Party organizations at all levels should establish close contact with the editorial department.

    采取具体措施加强党的生活的宣传
    ——山西日报加强党的生活的宣传的经验
    白汝瑗
    加强党的生活的宣传是各级党委机关报的首要任务之一。过去，各地报纸在这方面的宣传一般地说都很薄弱；不少报纸并且作过同党的原则相违背的夸大个人作用，散播个人崇拜、地方主义和分散主义的错误的宣传。自从党的七届四中全会以后，各地报纸关于党的生活的宣传都较前有了改进，并积累了一些经验。山西日报就是其中之一。
    山西日报自一九五零年设立党的生活栏以来，关于党的生活的宣传虽然有一定的成绩，但是由于对党的生活宣传的方针任务认识还不够明确，以致存在着以下的缺点：宣传报道范围狭窄，特别是对党的思想建设和组织建设宣传报道的很少；密切结合实际地报道党的决议的执行状况和党组织的活动状况做的不够；关于党的工作和生活的评论很少；宣传报道形式单调，不够生动活泼。
    山西日报编辑部在一九五四年第三季度检查出并认识了这些缺点之后，便采取各项措施来改进这些缺点，并已得到了比较显著的成绩。首先是宣传报道范围已较前扩大，党的建设的宣传报道已较前增多。如一九五四年十一月份发表的稿件中，就反映了以下各方面的问题：贯彻党的七届四中全会决议；关于发展党员；党对工业工作的领导；党对统购工作的领导；党对青年团的领导；另外还有报道各地党组织活动的小专栏。其次，注意了结合实际阐述党的原则。例如，一九五四年十一、十二月，山西省的中心工作是粮食、棉花和油料作物的统购。当时有不少的党组织放松了对这个工作的政治思想领导，以致影响了任务的完成。山西日报就在十一月二十四日发表了“做好党的政治思想工作是完成统购任务的保证”的社论，并发表了“中共临猗县委忽视政治思想工作的教训”的典型报道，充分说明了加强对这一工作的政治思想领导是党组织的首要职责。再次，评论工作较前加强了。以一九五四年十月作为界限，在此以前的半年内，山西日报只发表了两篇关于党的生活的社论和一篇短评；在一九五四年十月、十一月两个月，则发表了五篇社论，四篇短评。第四，宣传报道的形式较前多样化了；一九五四年十月以来，在报上运用的写作形式有社论、文章、通讯、消息、特写、简评和党员来信等，还组织了“党组织的活动”的小专栏和有关党的生活的某一问题的专页。
    山西日报关于党的生活的宣传所获得的成绩，是同山西日报编辑委员会领导的加强和党的生活组工作的改进分不开的。
    报纸编辑委员会对党的生活宣传的重视和加强领导是十分重要的；因为只有报纸编辑委员会把加强党的生活宣传看作报纸的首要任务之一，切实加强对党的生活组工作的具体领导，才能改变过去党的生活宣传的薄弱状况。山西日报的经验证明了这一点。山西日报编辑委员会在一九五四年第三季度根据中央关于改进报纸工作的决议研究改进工作时，首先以加强党的生活的宣传作为重点，结合对苏联报纸工作经验的学习，对报纸过去的党的生活的宣传报道进行了检查。在学习文件和检查工作中，他们着重地从认识上解决以下两个问题：一个是关于党的生活宣传的任务、特点以及它同其他方面宣传的区别问题。有的同志认为，既然党报上所有的宣传报道都必须是具有党性的，都要宣传和贯彻党的总路线、党的政策和决议，都要宣传党的领导作用，那末是否还要特别强调党的生活的宣传。他们所以有这种认识，主要是没有了解党的生活宣传的任务和特点。山西日报编辑委员会领导编辑部进行了讨论。在讨论中，使大家认识到党委机关报和党所领导的其他报纸的重要区别之一，就是党委机关报设立有党的生活组（其他报纸则没有这个组），负责全面地系统地宣传报道党组织的活动。党的生活组同编辑部的其他组都要宣传和贯彻党的路线和党的政策；但是它的任务是宣传报道党组织的生活和工作，也就是宣传报道党组织本身的思想建设和组织建设，阐述党的原则和党内生活的重大问题，宣传报道党组织对经济工作和文化工作的政治领导以及对人民群众的政治工作和组织工作；通过这些宣传报道来达到巩固和团结党、教育党员和推动党组织的工作的目的。很显然，这些任务是非常重要而且不能为其他组的工作所能包括和代替的。
    另一个问题，就是关于党的生活宣传同报纸其他方面的宣传，特别是经济宣传的联系问题。在讨论中，有的同志提出今后报纸究竟是以党的生活宣传还是以经济宣传作为宣传中心和首要任务的问题。这个疑问的提出，反映了某些同志忽视了党对经济建设的领导作用，忽视了报纸上党的生活的宣传不能离开现实生活特别是国家的经济建设进行宣传的原则。经过讨论，大家进一步明确地认识了由于执行和实现党在过渡时期的总路线和国家的第一个五年计划是我国全体人民的总任务，由于报纸上关于党的生活的宣传必须密切结合党和国家的斗争任务来进行，因此宣传党在过渡时期的总路线，动员人民群众完成国家建设的第一个五年计划是报纸工作经常的中心任务，而加强党的生活的宣传是这个任务的重要部分。
    山西日报编辑委员会在统一了编辑部的认识之后，便制定了关于加强党的生活报道和马克思列宁主义理论宣传的工作方案，明确规定了党的生活宣传的方针任务和报道方法。同时加强了党的生活组的干部配备，根据山西省委的指示，派编辑委员会委员之一担任了党的生活组组长，并充实了组内力量。这样，便为加强报纸的党的生活宣传打下了思想基础和组织基础。
    为了加强党的生活的宣传，报纸编辑委员会还要对党的生活组的工作经常关心和予以具体指导，这就是要采取具体措施帮助党的生活组的同志深入实际、深入群众，从提高干部的水平中来提高党的生活组的工作。在这期间，山西日报主要地采取了下列做法：为了提高稿件质量和开辟稿源，党的生活组采取了编采通合一的工作方法，及时和经常地派人深入下层。实行这个办法之后，在一九五四年十月、十一月两个月中，组内的大部分同志都下了乡，这保证了采访和组织稿件的任务的完成。前述的对当前工作起了较大作用的“中共临猗县委忽视政治思想工作的教训”一文，便是报社派出的记者和当地的记者站的同志在深入了解情况后合作写成的。写作重要评论时，在确定了题目后，便由组内集体讨论或派人下去调查，然后根据讨论结果或调查研究结果来写作。一九五四年十月二十八日发表的“必须重视对候补党员的教育和考察工作”的社论，就是派人下去调查并经过组内讨论后写出来的。一九五四年年底，山西日报编辑部一方面在编辑部内召开党的生活栏读者座谈会，一方面派人到榆次等地，通过个别访问、召开座谈会的方式，广泛地调查读者意见。编辑部根据读者的意见进行了研究，认识到报纸加强党的生活的宣传之后，已受到了各级党组织和广大党员群众的欢迎；但是宣传报道的范围仍然狭窄，不能适应客观的需要；另外，及时提出、阐明和解决党的生活中的重要问题还做得不够，因此党的生活宣传在实际工作中所发挥的作用还不够大。采用这种联系群众的方式来及时了解报纸的宣传效果，对于编辑部进一步改进工作，是很有用处的。
    党委机关报上党的生活栏也是党委作为自己联系各级党组织和教育全体党员的重要工具，因此党委必须十分重视和采取各种措施来加强报纸的党的生活宣传。中共山西省委对山西日报党的生活的宣传的领导，是由常委会来讨论批准报纸每月的关于党的生活的社论计划、重要的专题报道计划和季度的宣传要点。中共山西省委确定书记之一经常领导报纸工作。党委的各部门如省委组织部、省委纪律检查委员会在这期间对于山西日报加强党的生活宣传也较前关心并予以支持。山西日报通过各地记者站同各级党组织也建立了较前密切的联系。为了进一步改进山西日报党的生活的宣传，中共山西省委在一九五四年年底作出的关于改进山西日报和山西农民报的决定中，除要求山西日报编辑部每半年向省委报告一次关于党的生活宣传的状况和问题外，还要求各级党组织经常关心和积极帮助报纸编辑部做好党的生活的宣传，并对各级党组织如何同编辑部建立密切联系做了若干具体规定。
