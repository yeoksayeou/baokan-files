    The performance matches in China of the Czechoslovak Army Central House Men's Volleyball Team, which was invited to visit our country, opened in Beijing on April 5.

    Before the opening ceremony began, more than 7,000 people from all walks of life in the capital were seated around the court.

    Personnel from various countries' embassies in China also attended the opening ceremony.

    At the opening ceremony, Cai Shufan, Deputy Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission of our country, delivered a speech expressing a warm welcome to the Czechoslovak volleyball team's visit to our country. Novak, the leader of the Czechoslovak Army Central House Men's Volleyball Team, also delivered a speech expressing his gratitude.

    After the opening ceremony, the Czechoslovak volleyball team and our country's "August 1st" Men's Volleyball Team held a friendly match.

    The wonderful performances of the two teams won warm applause from the audience from time to time. As a result of the match, the Czechoslovak Army Central House Men's Volleyball Team won three to zero.

    At the beginning of the first game, the "August 1st" team adopted a fierce offensive, taking the lead at 4-2 and 6-5. The Czechoslovak team calmly responded, using the underhand serve to save many dangerous balls. Jersalci, a member of the Czechoslovak team who is 1.98 meters tall, used the method of spiking the ball from the far net to attack the backcourt of the "August 1st" team, scoring repeatedly. Finally, the Czechoslovak team won the first game 15-12. After the start of the second game, the Czechoslovak team was always in the lead. The "August 1st" team actively counterattacked, using quick attacks and cross-attacks, and once chased to 11-all and 14-all, but the Czechoslovak team still won the second game 16-14. After the start of the third game, the Czechoslovak team became more active, making more use of the tactics of two-hit passes and dink shots to score. Although the "August 1st" team used the fish dive to save many balls, they ultimately lost to the Czechoslovak team 15-8 due to more serving and spiking errors.

    捷克斯洛伐克男子排球队在京同“八一”排球队作友谊赛
    应邀来我国访问的捷克斯洛伐克军队中央之家男子排球队在我国的表演比赛，四月五日在北京举行开幕式。
    在开幕式开始前，球场四周已坐满了首都各界人士共七千多人。
    各国驻我国使馆人员也出席了开幕式。
    在开幕式上，我国体育运动委员会副主任蔡树藩致词对捷克斯洛伐克排球队来我国访问表示热烈欢迎。捷克斯洛伐克军队中央之家男子排球队领队诺伐克也致词表示感谢。
    开幕式后，捷克斯洛伐克排球队和我国“八一”男子排球队举行了一场友谊赛。
    两队的精彩表演不时博得观众的热烈掌声。比赛结果，捷克斯洛伐克军队中央之家男子排球队以三比零获胜。
    第一局比赛开始时，“八一”队采取猛烈攻势，曾以四比二、六比五领先。捷队沉着应战，用下手接球的方法救起不少险球。捷队身高一公尺九十八公分的队员捷萨尔齐，利用远网扣球的方法进攻“八一”队后场连连得分，最后捷队以十五比十二胜第一局。第二局开始后捷队一直领先，“八一”队积极反攻，利用快板、交叉进攻等战术，曾追到十一平、十四平，但结果捷队仍以十六比十四胜第二局。第三局开始后，捷队更形活跃，多利用两击过网和吊球的战术得分。“八一”队虽利用鱼跃救球的方法救起很多球，但终因发球和扣球失误较多，最后又以十五比八败给捷队。
