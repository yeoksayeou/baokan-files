Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, April 10th (TASS dispatch): The 17th Congress of the Dutch Communist Party opened in Amsterdam on April 9th. The congress will last for three days. The congress has three items on its agenda: 1. On the political situation; 2. Preparing for the upcoming parliamentary elections; 3. Election of the Central Committee.

Paul de Groot, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party, delivered a report on the first item on the agenda at the meeting.

De Groot pointed out that the tasks facing this congress are: to discuss safeguarding the security of the Netherlands from the new threat of aggression from German militarism, and to discuss the issue of defending peace. He pointed out that any unbiased Dutchman can have no doubt that arming West Germany means threatening our country with aggression.

De Groot also spoke about issues related to safeguarding the security of the Netherlands from such aggression. He emphasized that it is necessary to wage a struggle against the extreme right-wing groups, big capitalists, and landlords who are closely linked to West German capitalists and help revive West German militarism. He said that the patriotic forces of the Dutch people are opposed to them. If these patriotic forces are mobilized, then the struggle to implement a new foreign policy and to safeguard national independence can be won.

De Groot pointed out that the struggle to absolutely prohibit weapons of mass destruction is the most important issue for the Dutch people. The Dutch Communist Party firmly supports the World Peace Council's "Appeal to the People of the World" against the preparation for atomic war.

Speaking about the economic situation in the Netherlands, De Groot said that the living standards of the Dutch working people are constantly declining. He pointed out that militarization has sharpened the crisis in the Netherlands.

On the evening of April 8th, a grand rally was held in Amsterdam to celebrate the opening of the 17th Congress. In addition to the delegates attending the congress, many guests were also present. Gerben Wagenaar, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party, spoke at the meeting. The congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the congress was also read out at the meeting.

    荷兰共产党代表大会在阿姆斯特丹开幕
    总书记保罗·格鲁特作了关于政治形势的报告
    新华社十一日讯　据塔斯社海牙十日讯：荷兰共产党第十七次代表大会四月九日在阿姆斯特丹开幕，代表大会将举行三天。大会有三项议程：一、关于政治形势；二、准备迎接即将举行的议会选举；三、选举中央委员会。
    荷兰共产党中央委员会总书记保罗·格鲁特在会议上就第一项议程作了报告。
    格鲁特指出：这次大会面临的任务是：讨论保障荷兰安全以避免德国军国主义的新的侵略威胁，以及讨论保卫和平的问题。他指出，任何没有成见的荷兰人都可以毫不怀疑：武装西德意味着使我国遭到侵略的威胁。
    格鲁特还谈到同保障荷兰安全以避免这种侵略有关的问题。他着重指出，必须展开斗争，来反对同西德资本家密切联系和帮助复活西德军国主义的极端右倾的集团、大资本家和地主。他说，荷兰人民的爱国力量是反对他们的，如果发动这种爱国力量，那末，争取实行新的外交政策和争取保障民族独立的斗争就能获得胜利。
    格鲁特指出，争取绝对禁止大规模毁灭性武器的斗争是荷兰人民最为重要的问题。荷兰共产党坚决拥护世界和平理事会反对准备原子战争的“告全世界人民书”。
    格鲁特在谈到荷兰的经济情况时说，荷兰劳动人民的生活水平在不断下降。他指出，军国主义化使得荷兰的危机现象尖锐起来。
    四月八日晚间在阿姆斯特丹举行了一个隆重的集会，庆祝第十七次代表大会开幕。出席的除参加代表大会的代表外，还有许多来宾。荷兰共产党中央委员会主席格宾·魏吉纳在会上讲了话。会上还宣读了苏联共产党中央委员会给大会的贺电。
