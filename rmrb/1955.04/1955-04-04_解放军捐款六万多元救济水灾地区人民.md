Xinhua News Agency, April 1st: The leading organs of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) recently transferred over 62,000 yuan in donations to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the People's Republic of China to aid the people in areas affected by the floods in 1954.

    After learning that some areas had suffered from floods in 1954, cadres and soldiers of the PLA launched a mass movement to save money and donate to aid the disaster victims. They donated all the funds. Apart from providing immediate relief to disaster victims in their garrison areas and affected military families, the remaining 62,372 yuan was transferred by the leading organs of the PLA to the Ministry of Internal Affairs on March 25, 1955, to be sent to the disaster areas to aid the victims.

    The Ministry of Internal Affairs has now decided to allocate these donations to some areas that suffered relatively severe floods in 1954, focusing on assisting the families of revolutionary martyrs, military families, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers who are facing difficulties, helping them solve the difficulties in spring plowing and production.

    解放军捐款六万多元救济水灾地区人民
    新华社一日讯　中国人民解放军领导机关最近将六万二千多元捐款转交中华人民共和国内务部，救济一九五四年遭受水灾地区的人民。
    中国人民解放军的干部和战士在一九五四年知道有些地区遭受水灾后，就开展了群众性的节约捐款救济灾民运动。他们把全部捐款除了就近救济驻地灾民和受灾的军人家属外，将剩余下来的六万二千三百七十二元由中国人民解放军领导机关在一九五五年三月二十五日转交内务部，汇往灾区救济灾民。
    现在内务部已决定把这些捐款拨给一九五四年遭受水灾比较严重的一些地方，有重点地救济有困难的烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人，帮助他们解决春耕生产中的困难。
