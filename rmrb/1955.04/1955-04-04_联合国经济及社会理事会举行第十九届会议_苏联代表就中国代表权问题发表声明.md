Xinhua News Agency, New York, 31st—The nineteenth session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council opened on the 29th at the United Nations Headquarters.

    At the beginning of the meeting, Soviet Representative Sobolev issued a statement on the issue of Chinese representation. He said that it was improper and a serious obstacle to the normal work of the meeting that the legitimate representatives of the People's Republic of China, a major country with a population of 600 million, were not present at this session of the Council. The Kuomintang clique, which had been abandoned by the Chinese people, had no right to represent the Chinese people.

    Czechoslovak Representative Ulih supported the statement of the Soviet delegation.

    The US representative spoke in opposition. The Council took no action on the statement.
