    One Hundred Days of Victory Factory Relocation
    Jian Ren
    About seven or eight miles northwest of Luoyang city, amidst a boundless expanse of green wheat fields, stands a group of red-tiled buildings. Accompanied by the majestic, towering, blue-gray water tower, they are nestled along the quiet Luo River. This is the Luoyang Joint State-Private Rongda Cement Products Factory. It shoulders an arduous and glorious task in the construction of the motherland's interior.
    The Rongda Cement Products Factory was originally a factory under the leadership of the United Factory of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Construction Engineering Bureau. It was established in 1952 as a joint state-private enterprise (capitalist shares accounting for one-tenth of the factory's total shares). Its main products are: various calibers of high-pressure resistant machine-made steel-reinforced concrete pipes and small non-reinforced concrete pipes, such as water supply and drainage pipes, sewer pipes required for urban construction, as well as complex-shaped cement precast products required for industrial, water conservancy, and railway construction. The quality of this factory's products has consistently been praised by customers. In early November of last year, under the unified planning guidance of national construction and with the help of the government, the Rongda Cement Products Factory moved from Shanghai to Luoyang.
    The relocation of this factory went very smoothly. From site selection, factory design, construction to machine installation, it took only a hundred days in total. The factory director told me that in the entire process of settling the factory, the Party committee and government of Luoyang city, the people, and fraternal enterprises gave them strong support and assistance. In November last year, when the staff preparing for the relocation arrived in Luoyang, the farmers in the suburbs met their requirements for purchasing factory land; the principal of the primary school helped their children enroll in school to put their minds at ease. Due to the importance and supervision of the Party committee and government leaders, effectively organizing all aspects to provide support, coupled with the coordinated actions of the Municipal Industrial Bureau, the Municipal Construction Engineering Company, the Henan Provincial Department of Industry, and the Central-South Hydroelectric Installation Engineering Bureau, they completed all the design drawings for the factory buildings and dormitories, as well as the installation of high and low-voltage power lines in the factory area within half a month. After the factory buildings entered construction, the Municipal Construction Company also gave them great help.
    During the construction of the factory, they encountered many problems. For example, when driving piles into the factory base, the underground soil was very hard. Using a wooden ram to drive the piles, after two hours, the wooden ram was broken, and not a single pile was driven in. Worker Dang Fuke suggested using a stone roller weighing more than 200 kilograms to drive the piles, with a team of twelve people divided into two shifts rotating. It only took three minutes to drive in one pile, and within two days, all 120 piles were driven in. When installing the boiler and erecting the chimney, it was impossible to find crane operators anywhere. Workers Tan Fugen and Gu Asi came up with a solution, and with the lead of mechanic Li Wenguang, they created a simple lifting tool, finally completing the installation of important machinery.
    With the assistance and care from all sides, all the staff and workers of the Rongda Factory overcame various difficulties in order to strive for early production. They carried out machine installation simultaneously with the construction of the factory, ensuring that the test run plan was on schedule on February 20th.
    Before the relocation, the Rongda Factory often produced blindly due to the lack of clear supply targets. Shanghai originally had a local state-owned cement products factory, and all the cement products needed for municipal and factory construction were supplied by that factory. Although the quality of Rongda Factory's products was good, it could not find a market in Shanghai, so it had to rely entirely on itself to find customers. Because sales were not guaranteed, the annual and quarterly production plans of the Rongda Factory had great blindness. Products were stockpiled year after year, season after season, affecting capital turnover. In the fourth quarter of last year, more than 300,000 yuan worth of products were stockpiled, and the factory's production was suspended. Therefore, under the guidance of the national plan, it was decided to relocate the factory to Luoyang. At the time of relocation, there were still more than 100,000 yuan worth of goods that were brought to Luoyang to find sales outlets.
    In the several months since the relocation, thanks to the efforts of all the staff and workers, achievements have now been obtained. As early as March of this year, more than a dozen enterprises in Henan's Luoyang, Lushan, Zhengzhou, Shandong's Linqing, and Shaanxi's Xi'an and other regions had ordered goods from them by telegram or by sending special personnel. As production tasks increased, the factory started mass production on April 20th. When I visited the Rongda Factory, I saw that the staff and workers were all excited about the bright prospects of their careers. Worker Li Wenguang said: "In Shanghai, there were too few production tasks, the factory was stopped, and the workers were just getting paid without producing, which made me feel very uneasy. When we came here, as soon as our factory started, there were so many production tasks that we were too busy to handle them all. Some people say that Luoyang is hard, but I think that working here is intense and interesting. Because we are here to create wealth for the country." The factory director looked at the Luo River outside the window and said excitedly: "The Luo River has an inexhaustible supply of pebbles and yellow sand. In the future, we can produce cement locally and manufacture it locally. In this way, we can greatly reduce costs and save a lot of wealth for the country."

    胜利迁厂的一百天
    建人
    离洛阳城西北约七、八里的地方，在一望无际的绿色的麦海中间，有一群覆盖红瓦的建筑物。它们依伴着巍峨矗立的青灰色的水塔，座落在静静的洛河边。这就是洛阳市公私合营荣大水泥制品厂。它在祖国内地建设中担负一份繁重而光荣的任务。
    荣大水泥制品厂原来是上海市人民政府建筑工程局联合工厂领导的一个工厂，它是在一九五二年建立起来的公私合营工厂（资本家的股金占全厂股金十分之一）。它的主要产品是：各种口径的耐压力很强的机制钢骨水泥管和小型的无筋水泥管，如城市建设所需的上水下水排水管、阴沟管以及工业、水利、铁道建设所需用的式样复杂的水泥预制品等。这个厂的产品质量一贯得到主顾的好评。去年十一月初，荣大水泥制品厂在国家建设的统一计划指导下，在政府的帮助下，从上海搬迁到了洛阳。
    这个厂子的搬迁工作进行得十分顺利，从选定厂址、厂房设计、施工到机器安装，总共只有一百天。厂长告诉我，他们在安置厂子的整个过程中，洛阳市的党委、政府和人民以及兄弟企业单位，都给了他们大力的支持和帮助。去年十一月，当筹备迁厂的工作人员到达洛阳时，郊区的农民满足了他们征购厂地的要求；小学校的校长为了使他们安心工作，帮助他们的小孩就了学。由于党委和政府领导方面的重视和督促，有效地组织各方面来支援，再加上市工业局、市建筑工程公司、河南省工业厅、中南水电安装工程局的协同动作，使他们在半个月的时间内，完成了厂房和宿舍的全部设计图纸和厂区高压、低压电线的安接工程。当厂房进入施工以后，市建筑公司也给了他们很大的帮助。
    在建厂时，他们碰到的问题很多。比如在厂房基地上打桩时，地下的土质很坚硬，用木夯打桩，打了两个钟头，木夯被打破了，一根桩也没有打进去。工人党福科提议用二百多斤重的石轴轳来打，由十二人组成一班，分两班轮流掉换，三分钟就能打进一根桩，两天之内，就把一百二十根桩全部打进去了。在安锅炉和装吊烟囱时，到处找不到起重工，工人谭福根、顾阿四想出了办法，由机工李文光带头，创造了简便的起重工具，终于完成了重要机器的安装任务。
    荣大厂的全体职工，就在各方面的援助和关怀下，为争取及早投入生产而克服了各种各样的困难。他们在建厂的同时，进行了机器安装，保证了在二月二十日按期试车的计划。
    荣大厂在迁厂前由于供应对象不明确，经常盲目生产。上海原有一个地方国营水泥制品厂，所有市政及工厂建设需要的水泥制品，都由那个厂供应。荣大厂的产品虽然质量好，但在上海找不到销路，因此完全要靠他们自己找主顾。由于销路没有保证，荣大厂每年每季编制生产计划有很大的盲目性。年年季季积压产品，影响资金周转。去年第四季度积压产品三十多万元，工厂生产停顿。因而在国家计划的指导下，决定迁厂到洛阳。在迁厂时，还有价值十多万元的商品，带到洛阳找销路。
    迁厂几个月来，经过全体职工的努力，现在已经获得了成果。早在今年三月，就有河南省洛阳、鲁山、郑州、山东临清、陕西西安等十多个地区的企业单位，用电报或派专人来向他们订了货。由于生产任务越来越多，工厂在四月二十日就投入大生产了。当我访问荣大厂时，看到职工们都为自己事业的美好远景而感到兴奋。工人李文光说：“在上海生产任务太少，工厂停着车，工人光拿钱不生产，心里不安得很。到了这里，我们的工厂一开工，生产任务就多得忙不过来了。有人传说洛阳苦，我倒觉得在这里的工作紧张、有意思。因为我们是来为国家创造财富的。”厂长望着窗外的洛河，兴奋地说：洛河有取之不尽用之不竭的石子和黄沙，今后生产水泥可以就地取材、就地制造了。这样，就能大大降低成本，为国家节约大量财富。”
