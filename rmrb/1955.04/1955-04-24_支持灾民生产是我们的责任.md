    Supporting Disaster Victims in Production is Our Responsibility
    Letter from the Suiping County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Henan Province: The article "Suiping Supply and Marketing Cooperative Should Support Disaster Victims in Production" published on the "Reader's Letters Page" on March 27th is a very accurate criticism of us, and we sincerely accept it.

    Our practice of disregarding the difficulties of disaster victims' lives and adjusting commodity prices without the approval of higher authorities is obviously very wrong. This is because we have long held serious capitalist management ideas, lacked a mass perspective, and failed to earnestly understand the policies of the Party and the government. The higher authorities instructed us to purchase sideline products from the disaster-stricken masses according to the principle of "no loss, no profit, or small loss, no profit," but not only did we fail to work according to this spirit, but we violated this spirit by lowering purchase prices and downgrading products. This erroneous approach not only increased the difficulties of farmers' self-reliance in production but also affected the relationship between the Party and the people. Now, we have corrected the unreasonable purchase prices and mobilized all cadres to carry out a campaign to sell means of production to better serve spring plowing production and disaster relief.

专栏：批评建议的反应

    支持灾民生产是我们的责任
    河南省遂平县供销合作社来信：三月二十七日“读者来信专页”上发表的“遂平供销社应支持灾民生产”一文对我们的批评是十分正确的，我们诚恳地接受。
    我们不顾灾民生活困难，不经上级批准，擅自调整商品价格的做法，显然是非常错误的。这是因为我们长期存在着严重的资本主义经营思想，缺乏群众观点，没有认真领会党和政府的政策所造成的。上级指示要根据“不赔不赚，少赔不赚”的原则收购灾区群众的副业产品，但是我们不但没有根据这一精神进行工作，反而违反这一精神降低收购价格、压低产品级别。这种错误作法不仅增加了农民生产自救的困难，而且也影响了党和人民群众的关系。现在，我们已经纠正了不合理的收购价格，发动全体干部开展生产资料销售运动，更好地为春耕生产和生产救灾服务。
