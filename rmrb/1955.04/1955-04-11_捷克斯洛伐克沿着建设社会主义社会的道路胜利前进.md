    Czechoslovakia Triumphantly Advances Along the Road of Building a Socialist Society
    By Z. Fierlinger, Chairman of the National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic
    The Soviet people's historic victory in World War II also guaranteed the freedom and independence of the working people of Czechoslovakia. After the glorious Soviet Army liberated our republic, the lives of the Czechoslovak people underwent fundamental changes. The ideals for which our people had struggled for centuries had been realized. The people became the masters of their own country, and under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, they decided their own destiny, building a happy and joyful life for themselves and future generations.
    Our people's democratic state is a state of workers, working farmers, and intellectuals, which guarantees full democratic rights to all citizens. It does not merely proclaim these rights in form, but also practically and comprehensively guarantees them in fact. This is the fundamental difference between our socialist democracy and the bourgeois democracy before the Munich Agreement; before the Munich Agreement, all power was in the hands of a small group of major shareholders of banks and factories, and a gang of landlords, who believed that close collusion with foreign imperialists could guarantee their long-term rule at home. Wearing the mask of democracy, they increasingly cruelly oppressed and exploited the working masses and took terrorist measures against the representatives of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. At that time, the Czechoslovak Communist Party was the only party that bravely defended the interests of the working people of Czechoslovakia. The right-wing social democrats deliberately pursued a traitorous policy, attempting to make the working people abandon their just struggle.
    The following fact can illustrate the difficult life of our working people under the capitalist system: in the fifteen years from 1923 to 1937, almost 500,000 people left Czechoslovakia to find work abroad, 300,000 of whom were farmers. This is a large number for a country with a population of only 12 million. In the years of the capitalist republic, the economic crisis from 1930 to 1937 was the deepest period of exploitation and impoverishment of the working people; at that time, the number of unemployed reached nearly one million.
    During the period of bourgeois rule, Czechoslovak industry, especially large-scale industry, was always under the control of international monopoly capital; naturally, these monopoly capitals disregarded the vital interests and needs of the Czechoslovak people, and they tried to make as much money as possible from cheap surplus labor, as well as from the skilled labor and skills of our workers. Industry also lacked a reliable raw material base, and the development of the raw material base was deliberately hindered for the benefit of foreign capitalists. The production of iron and steel was suppressed at a very low level by the powerful European cartels to maintain the interests of the Ruhr capital giants, who were closely colluded with the US, British, and French monopoly capital. About 300 cartel contracts stifled the development of Czechoslovak industry, hindering the creative labor enthusiasm of the broad working class. Czech and Slovak capitalists, betraying the interests of the Czechoslovak people, became rich by relying on the generous dividends of international cartels. Therefore, in 1938, a decisive period, the leaders of the bourgeois alliance in the government, colluding with Czechoslovak and foreign capitalists, for their own greedy interests, sold out the Czechoslovak people and the Republic, signed the shameful Munich Agreement, which first split Czechoslovakia and then led to Hitler's direct occupation.
    In May 1945, when the Soviet Army liberated our country from fascist oppression, we were faced with the enormous task of not only ensuring the supply of food to the residents, but also restoring and putting into production the industry that had been destroyed and dismantled by the Nazi occupiers and deliberately bombed by the US Air Force at the end of World War II. The industry that had produced for the military needs of Nazi Germany during the occupation should now serve the restoration work of peace-loving Czechoslovakia. However, it was necessary to smash the power of the capitalists and landlords, to seize the management rights of banks, large and medium-sized industries into the hands of the people, to distribute land to working farmers, and to transform the entire structure of the national economy to adapt it to the real needs of a country embarking on the construction of socialism. The nationalization of large, medium-sized industries and financial institutions, and the confiscation and distribution of the land of landlords and traitors, were all realized with the support of the broad working people. Under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, which united the vast majority of the people in the country around itself, the economic and political power of the capitalists and their lackeys was destroyed, and after the victory in February 1948, our people were able to move forward more quickly.
    The first Two-Year Economic Plan, formulated under the leadership of Comrade Gottwald, put forward the task of restoring the national economy that had been destroyed by the Hitler gang's occupation. In the subsequent years of the Five-Year Plan, we carried out the reconstruction and construction of our industry, especially heavy industry and machinery manufacturing. The achievements of Czechoslovakia's first Five-Year Plan showed that we had successfully completed this enormous task. The production of machinery manufacturing, the main sector of Czechoslovak industry, increased 2.3 times between 1948 and 1953. During this period, electricity generation increased from 4.1 billion kilowatt-hours to 12.4 billion kilowatt-hours, and the extraction of coal and lignite increased from 34.7 million tons to 54.7 million tons. During these years, total industrial production increased by 102 percent. In Slovakia, industrial production almost exceeded the pre-war level by 350 percent. The production of means of production accounted for 62.3 percent of the total production.
    Due to the high tide of the people's labor enthusiasm and the great achievements in the economic field, the living and cultural standards of the residents have also greatly improved. In 1929-1936, the curve of workers' wages in the entire national economy showed a downward trend, until the end of 1937, the average monthly wage was only 421 crowns: from 1948, after the counter-revolutionary rebellion plan of the reactionaries was smashed due to the high vigilance of the people and the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the average monthly wage continued to grow, reaching 1,166 crowns in 1953. Since June 1953, as a result of three retail price reductions, the real wages of employees have continued to grow, increasing by 20 percent in 1954 alone. Due to the increase in requisition and purchase prices, the reduction in state supply quotas, and the further measures taken by the Party and the government, the income of working farmers has also increased. Last year, the sales of retail commodities increased by more than 20 percent compared with 1953, which proves the continuous growth of the purchasing power of the working people.
    The Party and the government are very concerned about the health of the residents. The number of doctors, hospitals, clinics, and preventive medical institutions has greatly increased. More and more attention is paid to the health of women and children year by year. Great achievements have been made in reducing infant mortality. Last year, the infant mortality rate was 37 per thousand, while in 1937 it was 127 per thousand. Due to the improvement of living standards and the improvement of health care, the average age of our residents has increased by ten years compared with before the war.
    The cultural activities of our nation and the amateur artistic activities of the working people have also developed extensively and promisingly. Many national opera houses and drama theaters, state theaters, and concert halls are often crowded with culture-hungry audiences.
    Our education is developing on an unprecedented scale, because everyone has the opportunity to receive education, and going to school is no longer the privilege of the rich. There are 50,000 college students studying in various universities in the country. In addition, there are 56,000 workers studying in vocational schools and night schools and correspondence schools affiliated to universities.
    The achievements of last year's election campaign for national committees and people's congresses confirmed the strength of our people's democratic system. In the election campaign, the people supported the candidates of the National Front and unanimously advocated: to adhere to peace and build socialism in our country; to maintain a lasting and unbreakable friendship with the Soviet Union, People's China, other people's democratic countries, and the German Democratic Republic. The political and economic achievements in the cause of building socialism have consolidated the growing political and spiritual unity of the working people united in the National Front; the leader and inspirer of the unified national front is our glorious Czechoslovak Communist Party. The working people are the masters of their own country, the creators of their own happiness, and due to the efforts of the working people, exploiters and plunderers no longer have the opportunity to get rich. Recognizing this can liberate the infinite creativity of the people who have been bound by the capitalist system for generations. There are now tens of thousands of advanced workers who have a new attitude towards labor and work with new labor methods.
    The socialist industrialization of the country enables us to propose a concrete program for rapidly improving the living standards of the workers, which stipulates new tasks for our national economy. This program was formulated according to the instructions of the 10th Party Congress held last year. First of all, we should greatly increase agricultural production, mainly livestock production; at the same time, we should develop heavy industry, which is the foundation of socialist economic construction, because heavy industry can rapidly develop the productive forces in industry and agriculture. Our heavy industry, especially machinery manufacturing, has the potential to supply the unified agricultural cooperatives and small and medium-sized individual farmers with an increasing number of mechanized tools through agricultural machinery stations. This fact, as well as the increasingly widespread application of advanced agricultural science methods, enables us to greatly increase the yield per unit area of crops and the yield of livestock products. Facts have proved that in state-owned farms and unified agricultural cooperatives that adopt socialist labor organization methods and advanced agricultural technology and livestock breeding technology, the work of the socialist component of our agriculture is far more successful than the labor results of individual farmers. This is an indisputable proof of the superiority of large-scale mechanized collective agricultural organizations, which points out the way for all our working farmers.
    The completion of this year's national economic plan should create preconditions for the successful completion of the new Five-Year Plan. From 1956, we will implement the second Five-Year Plan, which will begin at the same time as the Soviet Union's new Five-Year Plan. Therefore, it is necessary to create conditions for closer friendly cooperation with all countries in the peace, democracy, and socialism camp.
    The working people of Czechoslovakia have made great achievements on the road of building socialism. The great China has become a component part of the socialist camp, which has consolidated the international position of the people's democratic Czechoslovakia, further guaranteed its security, and consolidated the cause of peace. In the past, our people watched the Chinese people's struggle against foreign imperialism, domestic feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism with great concern and sympathy. We also welcomed the victory of the Chinese revolution with joy; now, we watch with deep, brotherly sympathy the achievements made by the Chinese people in building the country and gradually building China into a socialist country. The peaceful foreign policy of the People's Republic of China and its willingness to safeguard peace in Asia have been warmly welcomed by the people of Asia. The people of Asia have successively made demands to their own governments to establish and strengthen friendly relations with the People's Republic of China. The participation of the People's Republic of China as an equal member with other world powers in the Geneva Conference proves that the colonial and dependent countries regard the People's Republic of China as their defender, because it was the representatives of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union who helped the people of Indochina achieve a peace agreement. The people of Czechoslovakia watched with righteous indignation the shameless provocative acts of US imperialism on the coast of the People's Republic of China, and resolutely condemned their blatant interference in China's internal affairs, such as the current act of forcibly dividing China's inherent territory of Taiwan.
    The working people of Czechoslovakia strive to consolidate and further strengthen the friendly ties between Czechoslovakia and the People's Republic of China. Although the two countries are geographically far apart, it cannot hinder the realization of this desire. Our economic ties with each other are constantly strengthening. Within the scope of economic cooperation based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, Czechoslovakia supplies the People's Republic of China with industrial products in exchange for industrial raw materials and food for the residents. This economic cooperation can improve the living standards of the working people of both countries. Our cultural ties with the Chinese people are also constantly developing. The exchange of cultural delegations, the performances of song and dance troupes, and the organization of various exhibitions all make it possible for us to absorb the rich treasures of Chinese culture for thousands of years.
    The great Chinese people and the Czechoslovak people have a common goal—to safeguard peace, build their own countries, and ensure that the working people have a happy life. The people of the two countries are cooperating closely and friendly in order to achieve these lofty goals. The people of Czechoslovakia now and in the future strive to make the friendly cooperation between the two countries, as well as with all countries in the peace, democracy, and socialism camp, increasingly deep and consolidated.

    捷克斯洛伐克沿着建设社会主义社会的道路胜利前进
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国国民议会主席　兹·费林格
    苏联人民在第二次世界大战中所获得的历史性的胜利，也保证了捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民的自由和独立。光荣的苏军解放了我们的共和国以后，捷克斯洛伐克人民的生活有了根本的改变。我国人民多少世纪来进行斗争的理想已经实现了。人民成了自己的国家的主人，在捷克斯洛伐克共产党领导下，人民自己决定着自己的命运，为自己和后辈建设着幸福和愉快的生活。
    我们的人民民主国家是工人、劳动农民和知识分子的国家，它保证全体公民获得充分的民主权利。它不仅只限于在形式上宣布这些权利，而且在事实上也实际并全面地保障这些权利。我们的社会主义的民主制同慕尼黑事件以前的资产阶级民主制的根本区别就在于此；在慕尼黑事件以前，一切政权都掌握在一小撮银行、工厂的大股东和一伙地主手中，他们认为同外国帝国主义者紧密勾结在一起就可以保证自己在国内的长期统治。他们戴着民主的假面具，日益凶残地压迫和剥削劳动群众，对捷克斯洛伐克共产党的代表们采取恐怖手段。捷克斯洛伐克共产党在当时是唯一勇敢地捍卫捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民的利益的政党。而右翼社会民主党人却蓄意实行叛逆的政策，企图使劳动人民放弃他们的正义斗争。
    下面这一事实即可说明在资本主义制度下的我国劳动人民的生活是怎样的困苦：一九二三年至一九三七年这十五年内，远离捷克斯洛伐克到国外去找工作的，几乎有五十万人，其中有三十万人是农民。对一个仅有一千二百万人的国家来说，这个数字已经是很大了。在资本主义的共和国年代，一九三○年至一九三七年经济危机时期是劳动人民遭受剥削和陷于贫困的最深重的年代；当时失业的人数几达一百万人。
    捷克斯洛伐克在资产阶级统治时期的工业，特别是大工业，一直都在国际垄断资本支配之下；自然，这些垄断资本是不顾捷克斯洛伐克人民的切身利益和需要的，他们力图尽可能地首先从廉价的过剩劳动力，以及从我们工人的熟练劳动和技巧上赚得更多的钱。工业中又缺乏可靠的原料基地，为了外国资本家的利益而有意阻碍了原料基地的发展。铁和钢的生产，被欧洲强大的卡迭尔压制在极低的水平上，以维护和美、英、法垄断资本紧密勾结在一起的鲁尔资本巨头的利益。大约有三百个卡迭尔合同窒息着捷克斯洛伐克工业的发展，阻碍广大劳动者阶层发挥创造性的劳动热情。捷克和斯洛伐克的资本家，出卖捷克斯洛伐克人民的利益，靠着国际卡迭尔的优厚股息而发财致富。因此，在一九三八年这个决定性的时期，政府中资产阶级联盟的首领们，同捷克斯洛伐克和外国资本家勾结在一起，为着自己贪婪的利益，出卖了捷克斯洛伐克人民和共和国，签定了可耻的慕尼黑协定，这个协定首先使捷克斯洛伐克分裂，随后又招致了希特勒的直接侵占。
    一九四五年五月，当苏军把我们国家从法西斯的压迫下解放出来的时候，在我们面前就摆着这样巨大的任务：不仅要保证供给居民以粮食，而且要把被纳粹占领者破坏解体的以及在第二次世界大战末期美国空军有意炸毁的工业恢复起来并投入生产。在占领期间为纳粹德国的军事需要而生产的工业，现在应当为爱好和平的捷克斯洛伐克的恢复工作服务。但是，必须粉碎资本家和地主的势力，把银行、大工业和中型工业的管理权掌握在人民手中，把土地分给劳动农民，改造国民经济的一切结构，使其适应于着手建设社会主义的国家的真正需要。大工业、中型工业和金融机关的国有化，没收和分配地主、卖国贼的土地，都是我们在广大劳动人民的支持下实现的。国有化和分配五十公顷以上土地的全部过程是在三年期间尖锐的阶级斗争情况下完成的。在把国内绝大多数人民团结在自己周围的捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下，摧毁了资本家及其仆从的经济上和政治上的权力，在一九四八年二月取得了胜利以后，我国人民就能更加迅速地向前迈进了。
    哥特瓦尔德同志领导制定的第一个两年经济计划，提出了恢复因希特勒匪帮的侵占而被破坏了的国民经济的任务。在继此而后的五年计划年代，我们又进行了我们的工业、首先是重工业和机器制造业的重建和建设工作。捷克斯洛伐克第一个五年计划的成就表明，我们已经顺利地完成了这个巨大的任务。作为捷克斯洛伐克工业主要部门的机器制造业的生产，在一九四八至一九五三年间，已经增长了二点三倍，在这个时期内发电量从四十一亿瓩时，增加到一百二十四亿瓩时，煤和褐炭的采掘量从三千四百七十万吨增加到五千四百七十万吨。在这些年代里，工业生产总量增加了百分之一百零二。在斯洛伐克工业产量比战前水平几乎超过了百分之三百五十。生产资料的生产占生产总量百分之六十二点三。
    由于人民劳动热情的高涨，以及在经济方面获得了巨大的成就，居民的生活和文化水平也大大提高了。在一九二九至一九三六年间，整个国民经济中工人工资的曲线有下降的趋势，直到一九三七年底，每月平均工资仅四百二十一克朗：从一九四八年反动派的反革命叛乱计划由于人民和捷克斯洛伐克共产党的高度警惕而被粉碎后，每月平均工资即不断增长，一九五三年已达一千一百六十六克朗。从一九五三年六月起，由于三次减低零售价格的结果，职工的实际工资还不断地增长，仅一九五四年一年中，就提高了百分之二十。由于征购及收购价格的提高，对国家供售定额的减低，以及党和政府进一步采取的措施，使劳动农民的收入也增多了。去年零售商品的销售额比一九五三年增长了百分之二十以上，这就证明了劳动人民购买力的不断增长。
    党和政府非常关怀居民的健康。医生、医院、诊疗所和预防医疗机关的数目大大地增长起来。一年比一年地更加关怀妇婴的健康。在减低婴儿死亡率方面，已经获得巨大成就。去年婴儿的死亡率是千分之三十七，在一九三七年则为千分之一百二十七。由于生活水平的提高和保健事业的改进，我国居民平均年龄比战前增高了十岁。
    我们民族的文化和劳动人民的业余艺术活动也广泛地、大有前途地开展起来了。许多国立歌剧院和话剧院、各州的剧院和音乐厅，经常挤满了渴望文化的观众。
    我们的教育事业以空前未有的规模发展着，因为每一个人都有受教育的机会，进学校已经不再是有钱人的特权了。在国内各高等学校中学习的，有五万个大学生。此外，还有五万六千个劳动者在职业学校和高等学校附属夜校和函授学校进修。
    去年民族委员会和人民会议选举运动的成就，证实了我们人民民主制度的力量。人民在选举运动中拥护民族阵线候选人，并一致主张：要坚持和平、在我国建设社会主义；要同苏联、人民中国、其他人民民主国家和德意志民主共和国保持持久的、牢不可破的友谊。在建设社会主义的事业中所获得的政治和经济的成就，巩固了团结在民族阵线中的劳动人民的不断增长的政治上和精神上的统一；统一的民族战线的领导者和鼓舞者，就是我们光荣的捷克斯洛伐克共产党。劳动人民是自己国家的主人，自己幸福的创造者，由于劳动人民的努力，剥削者和掠夺者就再没有发财致富的机会了。认识到这一点，就可以使世世代代被资本主义制度束缚的人民的无穷无尽的创造力获得解放。现在具有新的劳动态度、以新的劳动方法工作着的先进者，是数以万计的。
    国家实行社会主义工业化的结果，使我们能够提出迅速提高劳动者生活水平的具体的纲领，这个纲领为我们的国民经济规定了新的任务。这个纲领是根据去年召开的第十次党代表大会的指示制定的。首先我们应当大大提高农业生产，主要的是畜牧业生产；同时要发展作为社会主义经济建设的基础的重工业，因为重工业可以使工业和农业中的生产力得到迅速发展。我们的重工业，首先是机器制造业，有可能通过农业机器站供给统一农业合作社和中、小个体农民以日益增多的机械化工具。这个事实以及日益广泛地应用先进的农业科学方法使我们能够大大提高农作物的单位面积产量和畜牧业产品的产量。事实证明：在国营农场以及采用社会主义劳动组织方法和先进的农业技术与养畜业技术的统一农业合作社中，我们农业的社会主义成分的工作的成绩，要大大超过个体农民的劳动成果。这就是为我们全体劳动农民指出道路的大规模机械化集体农业组合的优越性的不容争辩的证据。
    今年国民经济计划的完成，应当为顺利完成新的五年计划创造前提条件。自一九五六年起，我们将要执行第二个五年计划，这个计划将与苏联的新的五年计划同时开始。因此，必须为更紧密地同和平、民主和社会主义阵营中的一切国家建立友好合作关系创造条件。
    捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民在建设社会主义的道路上，已获得了巨大成就。伟大的中国已成为社会主义阵营中的一个组成部分，这种情况巩固了人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克的国际地位，使它的安全得到了更大的保证，并使和平事业获得了巩固。过去，我国人民怀着极大的关切和同情心，注视着中国人民反对外国帝国主义、本国封建主义和官僚资产阶级的斗争。我们也曾以愉快的心情欢迎中国革命的胜利；现在，我们怀着深厚的、兄弟般的同情，注视着中国人民在建设国家，以及使中国逐渐建成为社会主义国家的事业中所取得的成就。中华人民共和国的和平的对外政策、保障亚洲和平的意愿，受到了亚洲人民的热烈欢迎。亚洲人民都纷纷向他们自己的政府提出了同中华人民共和国建立和加强友好关系的要求。中华人民共和国作为与其他世界强国同等的一员参加的日内瓦会议，证明各殖民地和附属国家把中华人民共和国看做是自己的捍卫者，因为正是中华人民共和国的代表和苏联的代表帮助印度支那人民取得了和平协议。捷克斯洛伐克的人民义愤填胸地注视着美帝国主义在中华人民共和国沿海所施行的无耻的挑衅行为，并坚决地斥责他们对中国内政的粗暴的干涉，如现在以暴力分割中国固有的领土台湾的行为。
    捷克斯洛伐克的劳动者尽力巩固和进一步加强捷克斯洛伐克同中华人民共和国的友谊联系。两国在地理上虽相距遥远，但不能阻碍这种意愿的实现。我们彼此间的经济联系不断地在加强。在以平等互利原则为基础的经济合作的范围内，捷克斯洛伐克供给人民中国以工业制品，以此交换工业原料和居民的食品。这种经济合作可以提高两国劳动人民的生活水平。我们和中国人民在文化方面的联系也不断地发展着。互派文化代表团，歌舞团的演出，组织各种展览会，这都使我们有可能吸取几千年来的中国文化丰富的宝藏。
    伟大的中国人民和捷克斯洛伐克人民有着共同的目的——维护和平，建设自己的国家和保障劳动人民有愉快的生活。两国人民为了实现这些崇高的目的，正亲密友好地合作着。捷克斯洛伐克人民现在和将来都力求做到使两国之间，以及同和平、民主和社会主义阵营中一切国家之间的友好合作日益深厚和巩固。
