Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd—Fifteen Japanese groups from various sectors jointly held a conference on the afternoon of the 2nd to welcome the Chinese Trade Delegation visiting Japan. Approximately 1,000 representatives from political, economic, labor, women's, cultural, artistic, and peace and friendship groups in Japan participated in the welcoming conference.

At the meeting, Japanese representatives from various circles delivered speeches welcoming the Chinese Trade Delegation. Genzaburo Sugiyama, Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives, said that the visit of the Chinese Trade Delegation to Japan would not only promote trade relations between China and Japan but also strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries.

Tento Fujita, Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, said that one of the main directions of the Japanese labor movement now is to expand the peaceful economy, that is, to change the various policies that militarize the Japanese economy, reduce the domestic market, and hinder the development of friendly and peaceful trade relations with Asian countries. He stated that the Japanese working class is willing to make the greatest efforts for Sino-Japanese friendship and trade exchanges.

Nanbara Shigeru, representative of the cultural circles and former President of the University of Tokyo, said that it is unreasonable for Japan not to have restored peaceful relations with China and the Soviet Union. He hoped that the Japanese business community would have the perseverance to overcome all obstacles, and he believed that there must be a genuine spirit of independence for Japan's economy to be self-reliant and for trade between China and Japan to develop.

Delegation leader Lei Renmin said in his speech that the Chinese government and people establish friendly relations with all countries based on the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. The Chinese people hope that normal relations between China and Japan can be established quickly and develop towards peace and friendship. He conveyed the Chinese people's wish to see the Japanese people live a truly prosperous and happy life. Lei Renmin's speech was repeatedly greeted with warm applause.

Finally, the Chinese Trade Delegation received flowers presented by various groups. The Zenshinza Theater Troupe performed Japanese song and dance.

That evening, the Chinese Trade Delegation was invited to attend a welcome banquet for Japanese small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, attended by 500 people.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd—Representatives from twenty-two prefectures in Japan, including Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Shizuoka, Gunma, Niigata, Saga, and Gifu, such as Takayoshi Tanaka and Masaru Takei, made a special trip to Tokyo on the 2nd to personally invite the Chinese Trade Delegation visiting Japan to visit these places.

Delegation leader Lei Renmin received these representatives. He expressed his gratitude for the kindness of the people in various parts of Japan and conveyed the Chinese people's friendly greetings to the Japanese people.
