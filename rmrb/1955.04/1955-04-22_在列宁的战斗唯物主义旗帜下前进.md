    Advancing Under the Banner of Lenin's Militant Materialism

    I

    As we commemorate the 85th anniversary of Lenin's birth, we feel honored to be guided by the banner of Lenin's militant materialism as we advance. For the victory of our socialist construction cause, we are waging a fierce struggle against bourgeois idealism. This struggle requires us to learn diligently from Lenin and thoroughly understand all of Lenin's instructions regarding militant materialism.

    Throughout his revolutionary career, Lenin waged an irreconcilable struggle against bourgeois idealism. His early work, "What is to be Done?" thoroughly exposed the reactionary face of the Narodniks' "subjective philosophers" or "subjective sociologists." In 1908, he wrote the epoch-making masterpiece "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism," completely refuting the most reactionary and decadent subjective idealist philosophy prevalent in imperialist countries—Machism. During the First World War, Lenin devoted considerable effort to studying philosophy, writing the famous "Philosophical Notebooks," including "Conspectus of Hegel's Book 'Science of Logic'," which set an example for us in critically studying classical idealist dialectical philosophy. The article "On the Question of Dialectics" in the "Philosophical Notebooks" revealed the ideological roots of idealism from the epistemological perspective, providing us with the most powerful theoretical weapon to criticize and overcome idealist thought. In 1922, in his letter of instructions to the journal "Under the Banner of Marxism," Lenin called on the magazine to raise the banner of militant materialism to "resolutely expose and attack all modern 'graduated flunkeys in the service of clericalism'." ("On the Significance of Militant Materialism"). Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism" is one of the most brilliant examples of militant materialism since Marx and Engels. It exposed and shattered the nonsense of modern bourgeois idealist philosophy so profoundly and thoroughly that the working class in any country can draw endless strength from this work in its ideological struggle against the bourgeoisie.

    We should deeply understand Lenin's instructions on the class significance of the struggle between materialism and idealism. Lenin pointed out that the philosophical struggle between materialism and idealism is a struggle of partisanship, which is a concentrated reflection in the social ideological field of the struggle between mutually antagonistic classes in society. Modern idealism serves the interests of the reactionary bourgeoisie. If the bourgeois idealist ideology is not resolutely attacked, it will try its best to expand its influence, corrode the ranks of the working class and revolutionary people with anti-scientific fideistic ideas, lead various tasks and struggles in the direction of subjective blindness, deprive the working class of its scientific ideological weapon—Marxism-Leninism's dialectical and historical materialism—of its guiding role, and thereby lead to the disintegration of revolutionary forces. Lenin's following thesis on empirio-criticism is applicable to all bourgeois idealist philosophies.

      "One cannot fail to see the party struggle in philosophy, which in the final analysis expresses the tendencies and ideologies of mutually antagonistic classes in modern society... The objective, class role of empirio-criticism can be completely summarized as: faithfully serving the fideists in their general struggle against materialism, especially against historical materialism."

    The reason why Lenin was determined to thoroughly smash empirio-criticism was that the bourgeois idealist philosophical thought in Russia at that time had already demonstrated this vicious role of serving the reactionary rulers. When the Russian Tsarist government, taking advantage of the failure of the 1905-1907 revolution, intensified its political and economic attacks on the working class and its revolutionary party, bourgeois subjective idealist philosophical thought—Machism or empirio-criticism—actually infiltrated the Bolshevik ranks. Some unstable party members became Machists. Coordinating with the reactionaries' persecution of the revolution, they began to "criticize" and "revise" Marxism. And this attempt took the most cunning and dangerous form, that is, they still claimed to be Marxists on the surface, but secretly tried to destroy the theoretical foundation of Marxism—dialectical and historical materialism. If such an extremely dangerous attempt were not thoroughly exposed and smashed, and allowed to expand its influence, the Russian working class's revolutionary party would unconsciously undergo a fundamental ideological transformation, becoming an opportunist group loyal to the bourgeoisie, just like the opportunist social democratic parties in various countries. Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism" defended the theoretical foundation of Marxism and overcame the harm of bourgeois idealist thought to the Russian Party at that time.

    This work of Lenin's also has a major significance, which is: it liberated science, especially modern natural science, from the crisis caused by bourgeois idealism. New discoveries in physics at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries shook the old views of natural science on the structure of matter. Because natural scientists did not know how to correctly summarize these achievements using the principles of dialectical materialism, some people made the absurd conclusion that "matter has disappeared." Thus, natural scientists, because they could not understand the world with a correct worldview, became ideologically prisoners of bourgeois idealism. And bourgeois idealism took advantage of this weakness of scientists, fraudulently acquired the banner of "science," and disguised the anti-scientific subjective idealist thought of the 18th-century British Archbishop Berkeley as "the philosophy of twentieth-century natural science" (Lenin: Preface to the first edition of "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism" and Chapter 5, Section 2). Thus, when criticizing "empirio-criticism," Lenin faced the task of refuting the subjective idealist distortion of scientific achievements. Lenin spent great energy completing this task. He "synthesized from the materialist standpoint the most important and real achievements in science, especially in natural science, from the time of Engels' death to the publication of Lenin's Materialism and Empirio-Criticism" ("A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," Chapter 4, Section 1), pointing out that these achievements only showed that our understanding of the structure of matter was a step deeper than the old understanding, and did not prove the idealist fallacy that "matter has disappeared." These achievements proved the correctness of dialectical materialism, proving that our understanding of matter is infinite, and with the development of science, we will understand the essence of things more and more deeply.

    Because Lenin correctly summarized the latest achievements of natural science development and the experience of the working-class revolutionary struggle in the imperialist era, he further enriched and developed Marxist-Leninist philosophy—dialectical materialism.

      II

    Ever since the advanced people of China introduced Marxism-Leninism into China, a fierce partisan struggle has been constantly waged between Marxist dialectical materialism and bourgeois idealism. After the May Fourth Movement, although Chinese bourgeois revolutionaries like Sun Yat-sen continued to explore the road to revolution, and finally found the road to cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party, another part of the bourgeoisie closely linked to imperialism and feudal forces embarked on the reactionary road of firmly opposing the working class and revolutionary people. The "scholars" representing the interests of these bourgeoisies successively brought various ideological weapons against materialism and Marxism from the philosophy professors of imperialist countries. Almost all the most decadent and reactionary philosophical schools of thought in modern times flooded into China around the May Fourth Movement. Subjective idealism seemed to be holding a world expo in Chinese intellectual circles. This was naturally due to the special conditions of old China's semi-colonial status: every major imperialist not only had its agents in old China's politics and economy, but also found its agents in philosophical thought. Among these, the influence of American imperialism's pragmatist philosophy, represented by Hu Shih, occupied the first place. This was also in line with the trend of American imperialism's power gradually surpassing other imperialisms after the First World War. Hu Shih did not conceal his consistent philosophical and political hostility towards Marxism. He openly opposed pragmatism to dialectical materialist philosophy, and opposed his reactionary reformist political views to the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal people's revolutionary movement led by the Chinese Communist Party. Hu Shih's activities confused quite a few intellectuals and academic figures, attracting them to leave the people and the revolutionary movement, so as to serve the interests of imperialism and domestic reactionaries. The evil influence of pragmatism has continued to exist in New China, seriously hindering many people in intellectual and academic circles from moving towards the people and accepting Marxism. For the victory of the socialist cause, we must devote great effort to launching a critical struggle against it.

    Pragmatism pretends to be the "latest" philosophical thought, but in reality, it is a branch of the equally decadent subjective idealist philosophy as Machism. Lenin had already pointed out the reactionary blood relationship between pragmatism and Machism in "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism." Lenin said: "From the materialist point of view, the difference between Machism and pragmatism is as trivial and unimportant as the difference between empirio-criticism and empirio-monism." Like Machism, pragmatism denies the objective reality of matter, attempting to use "'experience' to cover up the philosophical lines of materialism and idealism, and sanctify the confusion between the two," but in essence, it uses the idealist point of view to interpret experience, denying that experience contains objective content that exists independently of human subjectivity. Pragmatism also denies reason in the name of experience, that is, denies theoretical knowledge that reflects the laws of development of things, and denies the objective truth of scientific knowledge. It regards truth as a subjective, purely relative thing, does not recognize objective truth, and does not recognize the dialectical connection between relative truth and absolute truth. Pragmatism, like Machism, distorts the achievements of modern science, turning it into a superficial decoration of subjective idealism. The only difference is that Mach borrows the name of modern new physics, while pragmatism uses the banner of evolution. It, like Machism, cunningly destroys science secretly under the mask of "science."

    At the same time as pragmatism, bourgeois scholars also brought other schools of Machism to China. For example, the philosophy of the British Russell—subjective idealism flaunting the scientific banner of mathematical logic—was once popular and its influence was second only to pragmatism. Kantian philosophical thought, which is slightly different from Machism but equally believes in agnosticism and subjective idealism, also found a certain market in China around the May Fourth Movement.

    There are also more blatant idealist thoughts that openly advocate abandoning science, flaunting "spiritual civilization," shouting to return to ancient Orient (Liang Shuming), advocating blind "free will," propagating Bergson's "life force's surge" that despises reason, and even demanding a return to the instinctive life of animals (Zhang Junmai), etc. These bourgeois idealist schools of thought with feudalist and even fascist elements also appeared after the May Fourth Movement.

    This is a brief picture of the various bourgeois idealist schools of thought that emerged in China's ideological and cultural circles after the May Fourth Movement. It should be mentioned that the disseminators of these idealist schools of thought often appeared with a "liberal," "apolitical," and "non-partisan" "pure academic" face. However, no matter how good people say on the surface, or how impartial they subjectively think they are, true "non-partisan" and "apolitical" philosophical thought is impossible. Naturally, the big landlords and big bourgeoisie who occupied the ruling position in old China and were closely colluding with imperialism were so base, narrow, brutal, and corrupt that even those with reactionary idealism sometimes felt unable to completely rely on it. Therefore, some individuals also took a position politically opposed to it, and gradually abandoned idealist thought after national liberation. However, when these "scholars" were enthusiastically spreading their idealist thoughts, wasn't their "pure academic" opposition secretly or openly targeting Marxism-Leninism—especially dialectical materialism philosophy, and therefore, in practice, cooperating with the reactionary Kuomintang government's "encirclement and suppression" of the revolutionary people? Didn't their various idealist philosophies consistently use the frenzy of anti-rational and anti-scientific fideism to confuse people's minds, and therefore directly or indirectly, consciously or unconsciously, guide people's thoughts in the direction of the reactionary rulers' fascist philosophy—the so-called "vigorous practice philosophy," "vitalism," etc.? Haven't the most stubborn and main representatives of these bourgeois idealists, such as Hu Shih and Zhang Junmai, already wholeheartedly relied on the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang!

    The situation in the Russian ideological circles when Lenin criticized Machism also existed in China, that is, bourgeois idealist thought put on the coat of Marxism, mixed into the ranks of revolutionary thought, and wanted to "revise" and "criticize" Marxism. The recently launched struggle to criticize Hu Feng's literary thought has clearly shown that Hu Feng's literary thought is not only attempting to "revise" and "criticize" Marxist literary theory under the guise of "Marxism," but also generally destroying Marxism, destroying dialectical materialism, and spreading various most decadent and reactionary bourgeois idealist mixtures under the banner of "Marxist literary theory" or "realism." The essence of Hu Feng's literary program is to obstruct the victory of our country's socialist transformation and socialist construction through literary activities.

      III

    As Lenin's principle of the partisanship of philosophy indicates, the struggle against bourgeois idealism that is currently unfolding in our country is a reflection of the class struggle in our country's socialist construction process in philosophical thought. Foreign imperialists and the resolute reactionary elements among all the eliminated and to-be-eliminated classes are trying their best to undermine our country's socialist cause. One of the most important methods they use to undermine socialism is to influence and corrode the people, corrode revolutionary work cadres, and our Party with bourgeois ideology. The spread of the influence of idealist thought is a form of ideological expression of the class struggle. Therefore, we must attach great importance to the current struggle to criticize Hu Shih's pragmatism and Hu Feng's literary thought.

    If someone regards the struggle against bourgeois idealism and the defense of dialectical materialism as merely a matter within the philosophical circles, or merely a matter of academic and literary circles, and thinks that it has nothing to do with practical work, then that is a big mistake. Various subjectivist errors have occurred in our work, and subjectivism is a kind of idealism in practical work. The spread of bourgeois idealism will inevitably promote the growth of subjective blindness. Lenin pointed out that the danger of idealism lies in its use of "fideism" to serve the bourgeoisie. The essence of fideism is subjective blindness. If we allow the bourgeoisie to use idealist thought to create subjective blindness in our work, this will seriously hinder and undermine our revolutionary and socialist construction cause, and this will enable the bourgeoisie to achieve its goal of resisting socialist transformation.

    Do not think that because the struggle against bourgeois idealism that we are currently conducting is only concentrated on Hu Shih's pragmatism and Hu Feng's literary thought, the problem only involves Hu Shih's and Hu Feng's fields of activity, such as history, philosophy, textual research, and literature. We must pay attention to the fact that the aspects spread by bourgeois idealism since the May Fourth Movement are even more extensive than this. For example, in natural science, industrial and agricultural technology, since many scientists were educated in bourgeois schools, the subjective idealist worldview will definitely not have no influence in these aspects. The problem is that this influence is often unconscious. Therefore, although some scientists think of themselves as purely scientific workers and have nothing to do with any philosophical thought, when teaching scientific problems of a theoretical nature, they often use words and phrases like Machism. Some industrial and agricultural technicians, when dealing with technical problems, often rely on their own subjective dogmatic formulas or subjective preferences to decide everything, regardless of whether it is suitable for objective reality, and still think that they are doing "real" "scientific" work. The recently exposed erroneous tendencies in construction and medicine are precisely the manifestation of bourgeois idealism. Why would scientists and technicians who believe in science and cadres who are responsible for leadership in these aspects be affected by anti-scientific idealism? Why would they fall into this unconscious contradiction? That is because they do not understand that philosophical problems are not only problems that philosophers have to consider. Anyone in any kind of work, when using their thoughts and studying problems, cannot but have a certain connection with a certain philosophical point of view (materialist or idealist), and true scientific thinking must be based on the philosophical point of view of dialectical materialism. If one cannot consciously grasp the ideological method of dialectical materialism in work, it is inevitable to become a prisoner of bourgeois idealism in this or that matter. Lenin once said the following passage on this issue, which is worthy of serious study and understanding by every person engaged in natural science and industrial and agricultural technology work:

      "... it should be remembered that unless natural scientists support their philosophical arguments, and their philosophical conclusions, by producing cogent arguments of a philosophical character, no natural science and no materialism can hold its own in the struggle against the onslaught of bourgeois ideas and the restoration of a *bourgeois* world outlook. In order to hold their own in this struggle and carry it to a completely successful finish, the natural scientists must be *modern* materialists, conscious adherents of the materialism represented by Marx, *i.e.*, they must be dialectical materialists." (Lenin: "On the Significance of Militant Materialism")

    Therefore, we must recognize that the partisan struggle between materialism and idealism is a struggle closely related to all academic departments and all practical work. We must learn from this struggle to draw a clear line between materialism and idealism, learn to consciously grasp the scientific weapon of dialectical materialism and oppose the influence of bourgeois idealism in our work, and avoid the growth of subjective blindness. In this way, under the banner of Lenin's militant materialism, our work in all aspects will be done better and better every day, and our socialist cause will proceed more smoothly.

    在列宁的战斗唯物主义旗帜下前进
    艾思奇
    一
    在纪念列宁八十五周年诞辰的时候，我们很光荣地感觉到列宁的战斗唯物主义旗帜在引导着我们前进。为着我国建设社会主义事业的胜利，我们正在对资产阶级的唯心主义思想展开激烈的斗争。这个斗争要求我们认真地向列宁学习，认真地领会列宁有关战斗唯物主义的一切指示。
    列宁在他一生的革命事业中自始至终都和资产阶级的唯心主义进行了不调和的斗争。他的早期著作“什么是‘人民之友’？”曾彻底揭露了民粹派那些“主观哲学家”或“主观社会学家”的反动面貌。一九○八年他写了“唯物主义与经验批判主义”这一本划时代的巨著，把流行于帝国主义国家的最反动最腐朽的主观唯心主义哲学——马赫主义驳斥得体无完肤。在第一次世界大战期间，列宁曾用很大的力量钻研哲学，写出了有名的“哲学笔记”，其中关于“黑格尔‘逻辑学’一书摘要”，给我们作出了批判地钻研古典唯心主义辩证法哲学的榜样。“哲学笔记”中“论辩证法”一文，从认识论方面揭露了唯心主义产生的思想根源，给了我们一个批判和克服唯心主义思想的最有力的理论武器。一九二二年他给“马克思主义旗帜下”杂志的指示信，号召这杂志举起战斗唯物主义的旗帜，来“坚决揭露并攻击所有一切现代‘僧侣手下拥有学位的仆役’”（“论战斗唯物主义底意义”）。列宁的“唯物主义与经验批判主义”是马克思恩格斯以后战斗唯物主义的最辉煌的范例之一。它是这样深刻、这样彻底地揭露和击破了现代资产阶级唯心主义哲学的胡说，使得任何国家的工人阶级在同资产阶级进行思想斗争的时候，都可以从这部著作里发掘出无尽的力量的源泉。
    我们应该深刻地领会列宁关于唯物主义和唯心主义斗争的阶级意义的指示。列宁指出哲学上唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争是党派性的斗争，它是社会上互相敌对的阶级之间的斗争在社会思想领域内的集中反映。现代的唯心主义是为反动资产阶级的利益服务的，如果对于资产阶级唯心主义思想不予以坚决的打击，它就要极力扩大它的影响，以反科学的信仰主义的思想来腐蚀工人阶级和革命人民的队伍，把各种工作和斗争引向主观盲目性的方向，使工人阶级的科学思想武器——马克思列宁主义的辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义——失去指导作用，并由此导致革命力量的瓦解。列宁关于经验批判主义的下述论断，对于一切资产阶级唯心主义哲学都是适用的。
      “不能不看到哲学上的党派斗争，这一斗争归根结底是表现着现代社会中互相敌对的阶级底倾向与观念形态。……经验批判主义底客观的、阶级的作用，完全可以归结为：替信仰主义者在其一般地反对唯物主义，特别地反对历史唯物主义的斗争中忠实服务。”
    列宁之所以要下决心彻底粉碎经验批判主义，就是由于资产阶级唯心主义哲学思想在当时俄国已经表现了这种为反动统治者服务的恶毒作用。当俄国沙皇政府利用着一九○五年——一九○七年革命失败的局面，对工人阶级和它的革命政党加紧进行政治上和经济上的攻击的时候，资产阶级的主观唯心主义哲学思想——马赫主义或经验批判主义竟然侵入到布尔什维克的队伍里来。一些立场不稳的党内分子竟成了马赫主义者，他们配合着反动派对革命的迫害，开始着手来对马克思主义进行“批评”和“修正”。而这种企图又采取了最狡猾和最危险的方式，那就是，他们在表面上仍然以马克思主义者自居，而在暗中却力图摧毁马克思主义的理论基础——辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义。这样的极端危险的企图如果不加以彻底的揭露和粉碎，而任其扩大影响，那么俄国工人阶级的革命政党将会不知不觉地在思想上根本变质，以至于成为效忠资产阶级的机会主义集团，就像各国的机会主义的社会民主党一样。列宁的“唯物主义与经验批判主义”捍卫了马克思主义的理论基础，克服了当时资产阶级唯心主义思想对俄国党的危害。
    列宁的这部著作还有这样一个重大的意义，就是：它把科学，特别是近代自然科学从资产阶级唯心主义所造成的危机之下解放出来。十九世纪末二十世纪初的物理学上的新发现，使自然科学上关于物质构造的旧的看法遭受到动摇，由于自然科学家不懂得用辩证唯物主义的原理来正确地总结这些成就，有些人竟作出了这样荒谬的结论，说“物质消灭了”。这样，自然科学家因为不能用正确的世界观来理解世界，就在思想上成了资产阶级唯心主义的俘虏。而资产阶级唯心主义也就利用了科学家的这个弱点，把“科学”的招牌骗取到自己手里，把十八世纪英国大主教贝克莱的反科学的主观唯心主义思想改头换面地假装成“二十世纪自然科学底哲学”（列宁：“唯物主义与经验批判主义”第一版序言及第五章第二节）。这样，列宁在批判“经验批判主义”的时候，就面临着要驳斥主观唯心主义对科学成就的曲解的任务。列宁花费了极大的精力来完成这个任务。他“用唯物主义观点综合了从恩格斯逝世起，至列宁所著唯物主义与经验批判主义一书出版问世这整个时期内在科学方面，尤其在自然科学方面所获得的最重大最实在的成果”（“联共（布）党史简明教程”第四章第一节），指出这些成果只是说明我们对于物质构造的认识比旧的认识更深入了一步，而不是证明唯心主义的“物质消灭了”的谬论。这些成果证明着辩证唯物主义的正确性，证明我们对于物质的认识是无穷尽的，随着科学的发展，我们就一步比一步更深入地认识了事物的本质。
    由于列宁正确地总结了自然科学发展的最新成果以及帝国主义时期工人阶级革命斗争的经验，他就进一步丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义哲学——辩证唯物主义。
      二
    自从中国的先进人士把马克思列宁主义介绍到中国来，马克思主义的辩证唯物主义和资产阶级唯心主义中间就一直不断地进行着激烈的党派斗争。在五四运动以后，中国的资产阶级革命派如孙中山，虽然继续探求革命的道路，并且终于找到了同中国共产党合作的道路，但另一部分同帝国主义和封建势力联系密切的资产阶级，却走上了坚决反对工人阶级和革命人民的反动的道路。代表这些资产阶级利益的“学者”们，接二连三地从帝国主义国家的哲学教授们那里搬来了各色各样反对唯物主义和反对马克思主义的思想武器，差不多现代所有的一切最腐朽最反动的哲学流派，在五四运动前后都泛滥到中国来，主观唯心主义好像是在中国的知识界开世界博览会。这自然是由于旧中国的半殖民地条件所产生的特殊情况：每个主要的帝国主义者不但在旧中国政治上经济上有它的代理人，也在哲学思想上找到它的代理人。在这中间，以胡适为代表的美帝国主义的实用主义哲学的影响竟占居第一位。这又是和美帝国主义的势力在第一次世界大战后逐渐凌驾到其他帝国主义之上这一种趋势相适应的。胡适并不掩饰他在哲学上和政治上一贯仇视马克思主义的态度，他公开地把实用主义和辩证唯物主义哲学对立起来，把他的反动的改良主义政治主张和中国共产党领导下的反帝反封建的人民革命运动对立起来。胡适的活动迷惑了相当多的知识分子和学术界人士，吸引他们离开人民，离开革命运动，这样来为帝国主义和国内反动派的利益服务。实用主义的恶影响一直遗留到新中国来，它严重地阻碍着知识界和学术文艺界的许多人士走向人民和接受马克思主义。为着社会主义事业的胜利，我们就必须用很大力量来展开对它的批判斗争。
    实用主义把自己假装作“最新的”哲学思想，但在实际上它是和马赫主义同样腐朽的主观唯心主义哲学的一个流派。列宁在“唯物主义与经验批判主义”里早已指出过实用主义和马赫主义的反动的血缘关系。列宁说：“从唯物主义底观点看来，马赫主义与实用主义底差异，是像经验批判主义与经验一元论底差异一样地极琐细和极不重要的”。实用主义和马赫主义一样，否认物质的客观实在性，企图用“‘经验’掩盖了哲学上唯物主义的路线与唯心主义的路线，并且把两者之混淆不清奉为神圣”，但实质上却是用唯心主义的观点来解释经验，否认经验中包含着不依赖人的主观而独立存在的客观内容。实用主义也在经验的名义之下来否认理性，也就是否认反映事物发展规律的理论知识，否认科学知识的客观真理性。它把真理看做主观的纯粹相对的东西，不承认有客观真理，不承认相对真理和绝对真理的辩证的联系。实用主义和马赫主义同样地把现代科学的成果加以曲解，使它变成主观唯心主义的一种表面装璜，不同的只是马赫假借了现代新物理学的名义，而实用主义则利用了进化论的招牌。它和马赫主义同样狡猾地在“科学”的假面具之下偷偷地来破坏科学。
    和实用主义同时，资产阶级的学者们还把其他马赫主义的流派也搬到中国来，例如英国的罗素的哲学——以数理逻辑的科学招牌为标榜的主观唯心主义——也曾流行一时而影响仅次于实用主义。与马赫主义稍有不同但同样信奉不可知论和主观唯心主义的康德主义哲学思想，五四运动前后也在中国找到了一定的市场。
    还有更露骨地表现着反动面目的唯心主义思想，公开主张抛弃科学，标榜“精神文明”，叫喊着要回到古代的东方（梁漱溟），宣扬盲目的“自由意志”，宣扬蔑视理性的柏格森式的“生命力的突进”，甚至于要求回到动物的本能生活（张君劢）等等，这些带有封建主义以至于法西斯主义因素的资产阶级唯心主义流派，也在五四运动以后出现了。
    这就是五四运动以后形形色色的资产阶级唯心主义流派在中国思想文化界蜂涌出现的一幅简略的图景。应该提到的是：这些唯心主义的流派的传播者，常常是以“自由主义”的，“超政治”和“超党派”的“纯学术”面貌出现的。然而，不论人们口头上是怎样讲得好听，或者主观上自以为好像是多么不偏不倚，真正的“超党派”、“超政治”的哲学思想是不可能存在的。自然，在旧中国居于统治地位的同帝国主义紧紧勾结着的大地主大资产阶级是如此卑劣狭隘，如此残暴腐朽，以至于连抱有反动的唯心主义的人有时也感觉到不能完全依赖它，因而个别地也有人在政治上走到同它对立的地位，并且在全国解放后还有逐渐放弃了唯心主义思想的。但是，当着这些“学者”们在热中地散播他们的唯心主义思想的时候，他们的“纯学术”的反对锋芒不正是或明或暗地针对着马克思列宁主义——特别是针对着辩证唯物主义哲学，并因此就在实际上配合了反动的国民党政府对革命人民的“围剿”吗？他们的形形色色的唯心主义哲学不是一致地以反理性反科学的信仰主义的热狂来迷乱人的头脑，并因此就直接间接地，自觉地或不自觉地把人的思想引导到反动统治者的法西斯哲学——所谓“力行哲学”“唯生论”等等——的方向去吗？这些资产阶级唯心主义的最顽固最主要的代表，如胡适、张君劢之流，不是已经死心蹋地投靠了蒋介石匪帮了吗！
    列宁批判马赫主义时候的俄国思想界中的情形，在中国也是有的，那就是资产阶级唯心主义思想穿上了马克思主义的外衣，混到革命的思想队伍里来，要来“修正”和“批评”马克思主义。最近展开的批判胡风文艺思想的斗争，已经清清楚楚地表明：胡风的文艺思想不仅仅是企图在“马克思主义”的伪装下面来“修正”和“批评”马克思主义的文艺理论，而且同时就是在“马克思主义文艺理论”或“现实主义”的招牌下面，来一般地破坏马克思主义，破坏辩证唯物主义和散布各种最腐朽最反动的资产阶级唯心主义的杂拌。胡风的文艺纲领的实质就是要通过文艺活动来阻碍我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业的胜利。
      三
    正如列宁关于哲学的党派性原则所指示的那样，目前正在我国展开着的反对资产阶级唯心主义的斗争，是我国社会主义建设过程中阶级斗争在哲学思想上的反映。外国帝国主义和一切已被消灭以及将被消灭的阶级中的坚决反动分子千方百计企图破坏我国的社会主义事业，他们破坏社会主义的最重要的方法之一，就是用资产阶级思想来影响和腐蚀人民，腐蚀革命工作干部和我们的党。唯心主义思想影响的散布，就是阶级斗争在思想上的一种表现形式。所以必须对目前批判胡适的实用主义和胡风的文艺思想的斗争予以高度的重视。
    如果有人把反对资产阶级唯心主义和捍卫辩证唯物主义的斗争看做仅仅是哲学界内部的事情，或仅仅是学术文艺界的事情，而认为同实际工作无关，那就是犯了很大的错误。我们的工作中曾发生过种种主观主义的错误，而主观主义就是实际工作中的一种唯心主义。资产阶级唯心主义的散布，必然会促进主观盲目性的滋长。列宁指出唯心主义的危险就在于它用“信仰主义”来为资产阶级服务。信仰主义的实质也就是主观盲目性。如果任随资产阶级用唯心主义的思想来造成我们工作中的主观盲目性，这就会严重地阻碍和破坏我们的革命和社会主义建设事业，这就会使资产阶级达到反抗社会主义改造的目的。
    不要因为我们现在所进行的反对资产阶级唯心主义的斗争只是集中在胡适的实用主义和胡风的文艺思想方面，以为问题只涉及胡适和胡风的活动领域，如历史，哲学，考据，文艺等领域。我们要注意到，五四以来资产阶级唯心主义所散布的方面是比这更为广泛的，例如自然科学，工农业技术方面，由于许多科学家是在资产阶级学校里受过教育的，所以主观唯心主义的世界观在这些方面也决不会没有影响。问题是这种影响常常是不自觉的，因此，有些科学家虽然自以为是单纯的科学工作者，同任何哲学思想没有关系，但在讲授科学上带理论性质的问题的时候，往往就使用了马赫主义一类的词句。有些工农业技术家在处理技术问题的时候，往往凭着自己主观的教条公式或主观的爱好来决定一切，而不顾是否适合客观的实际，还自以为是在做“真正”“科学”的工作。最近揭露的关于建筑方面和医药方面的错误倾向，正是资产阶级唯心论的表现。为什么自信是崇奉科学的科学家们和技术家们和在这些方面工作中负领导责任的干部竟会受到反科学的唯心主义的影响？为什么他们竟会陷入这种不自觉的矛盾？那就是由于他们不了解哲学问题不是仅仅限于哲学家才要考虑的问题，任何一种工作中的任何一个人，在运用思想和钻研问题的时候，就不能不同某种哲学观点（唯物的或唯心的）发生一定的联系，而真正的科学思考，必然是要以辩证唯物主义的哲学观点为基础的。不能自觉地在工作中来掌握辩证唯物主义的思想方法，就难免在这一件事或那一件事上成为资产阶级唯心主义的俘虏。对于这个问题，列宁曾说过下面一段话，值得我们每一个从事自然科学和工农业技术工作的人员认真加以学习和领会：
      “……应该知道，任何自然科学，任何唯物主义，若拿不出强有力的哲学上的论证，就抵挡不住资产阶级观念底攻击，也阻止不了资产阶级世界观底复辟。为要支持住这个斗争，为要把这个斗争进行到底而获得完全胜利，那么自然科学家就必须做一个现代的唯物主义者，做一个马克思所代表的唯物主义底自觉信徒，即必须做一个辩证唯物主义者。”（列宁：“论战斗唯物主义底意义”）
    因此，我们必须认识到唯物主义和唯心主义的党派性的斗争，是同一切学术部门和一切实际工作密切相关的斗争，我们要从这个斗争中来学会划清唯物主义和唯心主义的界线，学会在工作中自觉地掌握辩证唯物主义的科学武器和反对资产阶级唯心主义的影响，避免主观盲目性的滋长。这样，在列宁的战斗唯物主义旗帜之下，我们各方面的工作就会一天天做得更好，我们的社会主义事业就会进行得更加顺利。
