Guiding Agricultural Production by District and Category
　　Tian Liu, Liu Jie

　　In 1954, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture began to implement the policy of guiding agricultural production throughout the province by district and category. This is an important measure. It effectively overcame the shortcomings of generalization in agricultural production leadership and powerfully promoted the improvement of agricultural production levels throughout the province. Before 1953, due to a lack of understanding of the regional nature of agricultural production and unfamiliarity with the growing habits of different crops and varieties, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture made many subjective errors and suffered from bureaucratic problems such as generalization and untimely guidance in guiding agricultural production throughout the province. These mistakes turned good intentions into bad results and productive measures into lessons in yield reduction, causing unnecessary losses in production. In 1951, such a thing happened: more than 10,000 mu of kenaf were blindly promoted in the Xinzhou Special District. Because the local farmers did not have the technology to grow kenaf, nor did they have the conditions for retting, the result was a great loss in production. In the same year, the semi-spring "Biyu Wheat" was blindly promoted in the Jinan Special District. As a result, most of it was frozen to death in the winter and there was no harvest. In 1952, the agricultural leading departments in individual regions, regardless of soil, climate, cultivation, varieties, and other conditions, generally called on farmers to "densely plant," and some farmers densely planted corn up to 5,000 plants per mu. As a result, they could not grow, and half of the plants could not produce ears. There were even more phenomena of generalization and untimely guidance in agricultural guidance. At that time, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture's guidance on agricultural production throughout the province was often based only on the agricultural seasons in the Taiyuan area. The fruit trees in the Jinan area had already blossomed when they received instructions from the Department of Agriculture about "grafting"; the wool in the Jinbei area had already been sheared when the notice to shear wool was just issued. In the face of the lessons learned from these many facts, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture gradually realized that guiding agricultural production must proceed from the different economic characteristics and natural conditions of various regions, and implement the policy of guiding by district and category.

　　After the leading ideology was clarified, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture began to plan agricultural production areas throughout the province.

　　The natural conditions in Shanxi Province are very complex. The climate in the south is warm, and the climate in the north is cold. The agricultural seasons in the two regions differ by more than a month, the frost-free period differs by as many as 80 days, and the average annual temperature differs by six or seven degrees. The difference in elevation is even greater. Low-lying areas are only 360 meters above sea level, while high-lying areas (arable land) reach 1,063 meters, and the highest peak reaches more than 3,000 meters. Under complex natural conditions, there are great differences in crop distribution. The Jinan area is suitable for growing cotton and wheat, while the Jinbei area mostly grows spring wheat, potatoes, naked oats, flax, and other crops with shorter growing periods and strong resistance to cold and drought. The level of cultivation technology varies greatly from place to place. Advanced areas have already used tractors or new agricultural tools, and cultivation is more refined; backward areas do not even have old-fashioned agricultural tools such as drills and harrows, and farmland is still plowed with wooden plows. Crops are neither cultivated nor fertilized, and they are still in the stage of "extensive planting and low harvesting." The agricultural zoning of Shanxi Province is based on the characteristics of natural conditions in various regions, the different distribution of crops, and the level of cultivation, dividing the province into five agricultural zones: Jinan, Jinzhong, Jindongnan, Jinxi, and Jinbei. In order to implement the guiding principles of zoning and categorization within a large zoning range, each special district and county has divided several smaller agricultural zones according to the specific local conditions; each district, township, and agricultural production cooperative implements land and crop alignment to achieve planting according to local conditions and accumulate cultivation experience.

　　After dividing the agricultural zones, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture established agricultural production guidance organizations in various different agricultural zones. This is an extremely important organizational measure for implementing the principles of zoning and categorization. Only by gradually establishing agricultural technology guidance organizations as needed and under possible conditions can the principles of zoning and categorization be transformed into practical measures; only when technical guidance cadres go deep into the countryside, into the fields, and into the production process, and conduct scientific and technical research in conjunction with farmers' production experience, can specific measures suitable for the agricultural needs of the region be further determined and specific guidance be carried out. In 1954, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture established 377 agricultural technology extension stations throughout the province, equipped with 1,677 agricultural technical cadres; and established 17 agricultural science and technology base points in the three districts of Jinan, Jinzhong, and Jindongnan, and established an alkalization improvement work team in the Jinzhong alkalized area, and established a soil and water conservation station in Jinxi Northwest.

　　The agricultural technical guidance stations and agricultural science and technology base points distributed in various different regions conduct research and promotion work according to the different conditions and characteristics of the region, specifically implementing and executing the principles of zoning and categorization. For example, the stations and points set up in the Jinan area have carried out a lot of work based on the characteristics of this area, such as the warm climate, flat terrain, very little organic matter in the soil (according to a typical survey by the North China Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the organic matter content is less than one percent), lack of fertilizer, and serious insect pests. The main crops in the Jinan area are cotton and wheat, and the stations and points in this area have conducted research on the cultivation and management of these two crops. In wheat field cultivation, rotation and fallowing are promoted, superior varieties are selected, and a dense planting method of "narrow rows, even sowing, and appropriately increasing the sowing amount" is implemented; in cotton fields, the prevention and control of cotton pests, improved field management, the promotion of Qu Yaoli's "five-beat pruning" technical experience, appropriately advancing the sowing period, and timely and appropriate fertilization and irrigation are actively promoted to increase cotton field yields.

　　After a year of work, the agricultural technology extension stations and agricultural science and technology base points in various regions have, to varying degrees, grasped the characteristics of the region and begun to propose and solve several important problems in local agricultural production. After the Zhang Qing base point station in Yuci County discovered that black smut disease was an important reason for the yield reduction of sorghum, the main crop in this area, it vigorously advocated and specifically guided the agricultural production cooperatives to implement measures such as "Ceresan" seed dressing and removing diseased plants. After taking these measures, the incidence of sorghum black smut disease has been reduced from the original 17 percent to 9.9 percent. Last year, the soil and water conservation base point station in Nuanquan Township, Baode County, promoted the ridge and furrow planting method on the Loess Plateau, and crop yields increased by more than 11 percent. Over the past year, all points and stations in the province have played a guiding role in typical demonstrations in the promotion of technical measures such as dense planting drills, wheat field green manure, high-temperature rapid composting, corn artificial auxiliary pollination, and drug seed dressing. In 1954, the province transformed more than 35,000 dense planting drills (from 7-inch row spacing to about 5 inches), making the dense planting area reach about 30 percent of the total wheat field area; 950,000 mu of wheat fields were covered with green manure, beginning to change the habit of not fertilizing wheat fields in some areas. In cotton cultivation, in addition to promoting yield-increasing methods such as equidistant planting, uniform seedlings, and reasonable dense planting, the cotton-producing areas have initially determined the maximum number of cultivated plants per unit area according to conditions such as region, land, and variety, overcoming the bias of blind dense planting in the past.

　　Facts over the past year have proved that the method of guiding agricultural production by district and category is a very effective measure to improve the leadership of agricultural production and increase agricultural production. But after all, this is a new job. Due to the short implementation time and lack of experience, there are inevitably some shortcomings that need to be further improved. The main shortcomings in the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture's implementation of the work of guiding agricultural production by district and category are: (1) Although the technical guidance plan points out the scope, characteristics, and main technical measures that must be taken in each agricultural zone, it does not specifically stipulate the steps to be implemented and the degree of completion. This has led the agricultural leading departments of some special districts and counties to remain at the level of rhetoric and planning to varying degrees in realizing the principles of zoning and categorization. (2) It is not scientific and reasonable to plan the entire province into five agricultural zones. For example, the southern half of the Jinxi agricultural zone is a cotton and wheat promotion zone, while the northern half is a flax and spring wheat producing area. It is obviously inappropriate to divide it into one agricultural zone and needs to be revised. (3) The Department of Agriculture lacks specific and in-depth inspection work in implementing the guiding principles of zoning and categorization, and has not more seriously and systematically summarized and studied the experience and problems in the work, and there are still remnants of generalized work styles. These must continue to be improved.

    分区分类指导农业生产
  　田流　刘杰
    一九五四年，山西省人民政府农业厅开始实行了分区分类指导全省农业生产的方针。这是一项重要的措施。它有效地克服了农业生产领导上一般化的缺点，有力地促进了全省农业生产水平的提高。一九五三年以前，由于不明确农业生产的区域性，不熟悉不同作物、品种生长的习性，山西省农业厅在指导全省的农业生产中，发生过很多主观主义的错误和一般化、指导不及时等官僚主义的毛病，把好事办成坏事，把增产措施变成减产教训，使生产遭受了不应有的损失。一九五一年曾经发生过这样的事情：在忻县专区盲目推广洋麻一万多亩。因为当地农民没有种植洋麻的技术，也没有沤麻的条件，结果，造成了生产上很大的损失。同年，还在晋南专区盲目地推广半春性的“碧玉麦”，结果，到了冬季大部被冻死，没有收成。一九五二年，个别地区的农业领导部门不看土壤、气候、耕作、品种等条件，笼统地号召农民“密行密植”，有的农民密植玉米竟达每亩五千株，结果，长不起来，一半的株数不能出穗结棒。至于农业指导上的一般化和指导不及时等现象就更多了。那时山西省农业厅对全省农业生产的指导，往往只是根据太原地区的农事节令。晋南地区果树已经开花了，才接到了农业厅关于“嫁接”的指示；晋北地区的羊毛已经剪过了，剪羊毛的通知才刚刚下达。在这许多事实的教训面前，山西省农业厅才逐步明确了指导农业生产必须从各地不同的经济特点和自然条件出发，实行分区分类指导的方针。
    领导思想明确后，山西省农业厅就着手对全省进行农业生产区域的规划工作。
    山西省的自然条件是十分复杂的。南部气候温暖，北部气候寒冷，两个地区的农事节令相差一个多月，无霜期相差达八十多天，全年的平均温度相差六、七度；地势的高低悬殊就更大了，低洼地区拔海仅三百六十公尺，而高地（可耕地）则达一千零六十三公尺，最高山峰更达三千多公尺。在复杂的自然条件下，作物分布就有极大的差异，晋南地区适宜棉、麦生长，而晋北地区则大部种植生长期较短、抗寒、抗旱力强的春麦、马铃薯、莜麦、亚麻等作物。各地耕作技术水平也极不一致。先进地区已经使用拖拉机或新式农具，耕作也较精细；落后地区还没有耧耙等旧式农具，耕地还用木犁，对作物既不中耕培土，也不施肥，还停留在“广种薄收”的阶段。山西省的农业区划就是根据各地自然条件的特点，作物分布的不同，耕作水平的高低，把全省划分为晋南、晋中、晋东南、晋西、晋北等五个农业区。为了能够在大的区划范围内贯彻分区分类的指导原则，各专区、县，又根据当地的具体情况，划分若干较小的农业区；各区、乡、农业生产合作社则实行土地、作物站队，来达到因地种植并积累耕作经验的目的。
    划分好农业区以后，山西省农业厅又在各个不同的农业区里，建立了农业生产的指导机构。这是贯彻分区分类指导原则的一项极其重要的组织措施。只有在可能的条件下，根据需要逐步建立起农业技术指导组织，才能使分区分类指导的原则变成实际的措施；只有技术指导干部深入农村，深入田间，深入生产过程，结合农民生产经验进行科学、技术研究，才能够进一步确定适合本地区农事需要的具体措施，进行具体指导。一九五四年山西省农业厅在全省建立了三百七十七个农业技术推广站，配备了一千六百七十七个农业技术干部；并在晋南、晋中、晋东南三个区建立了十七个农业科学技术基点，在晋中碱化地区成立了碱化改良工作队，在晋西北建立了水土保持工作站。
    分布在各个不同地区的农业技术指导站、农业科学技术基点，根据本地区不同的条件和特点，进行研究、推广工作，具体地贯彻和执行着分区分类指导的原则。如设置在晋南地区的站和点，根据这个区气候温暖、地势平坦、土壤中含有机质极少（据华北农业科学研究所典型调查，有机质含量不到百分之一）、肥料缺乏、虫害严重等特点，进行了许多工作。晋南区主要作物是棉花和小麦，这个地区的站和点对这两种作物的栽培、管理进行了研究。在麦田栽培中推行了轮作、倒茬，选用优种，实行“窄行匀种、适当增加播种量”的密植法；在棉田中积极推行了防治棉花虫害，改进田间管理，推广曲耀离“五打整枝”技术经验，适当提早播种期，适时适量施肥浇灌等提高棉田产量的措施。
    经过一年来的工作，各个地区的农业技术推广站、农业科学技术基点，都已程度不同地掌握了本地区的特点，开始提出和解决当地农业生产中若干重要问题。榆次县张庆基点站发现黑穗病是这个地区的主要作物——高粱减产的重要原因后，就大力提倡并具体指导农业生产合作社实行“赛力散”拌种和拔除病株等措施。经过采取这些措施后，高粱黑穗病的发病率已从原来的百分之十七降低到百分之九点九。保德县暖泉乡水土保持基点站去年在黄土坡地上，推广了沟垄种植法，农作物增产达百分之十一以上。全省各个点、站，一年来在推广密植耧、麦田压绿肥、高温速成沤肥、玉米人工辅助授粉、药剂拌种等技术措施，都起了典型示范的指导作用。一九五四年全省共改制密植耧三万五千多张（由七寸行距改成五寸左右），使密植面积达到麦田总面积的百分之三十左右；麦田压绿肥九十五万亩，开始改变了某些地区麦田不施肥的习惯。棉花栽培中各产棉区除推行了等距、匀苗、合理密植等增产方法以外，已经根据地区、土地、品种等条件，初步确定了单位面积的最高栽培株数，克服了过去那种盲目密植的偏向。
    一年来的事实证明，分区分类指导农业生产的方法，是改善对农业生产的领导，提高农业生产的一个十分有效的措施。但这毕竟是一件新的工作，由于实行的时间短和缺乏经验，不可避免地还存在一些缺点，需要进一步改进和提高。山西省农业厅在贯彻分区分类指导农业生产工作中存在的主要缺点是：（一）在技术指导方案中，虽然指出了各个农业区的范围、特点以及必须采取的主要技术措施，但没有具体规定出贯彻的步骤和完成的程度，这就使某些专区、县的农业领导部门对实现分区分类指导原则，程度不同地停留在口头上和计划中。（二）把全省规划成五个农业区也不够科学和合理，如晋西农业区的南半部为棉麦推广区，而北半部则是亚麻、春麦产区，把它划在一个农业区显然不合适，需要修正。（三）农业厅在贯彻分区分类的指导原则中，缺乏具体深入的检查工作，没有更认真地系统地总结和研究工作中的经验和问题，还残存着一般化的工作作风。这些都必须继续加以改进。
