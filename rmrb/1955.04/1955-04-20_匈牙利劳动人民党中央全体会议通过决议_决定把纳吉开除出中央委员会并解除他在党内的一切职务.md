Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 19th. Budapest Dispatch: The Hungarian "Free People's Daily" reported that the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party held a plenary session on the 14th. The meeting unanimously passed the following resolution:

　　The Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party has ascertained that Comrade Imre Nagy, as a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic, holds political views that are diametrically opposed to the entire policy of our party, and to the interests of the working class, working peasants, and the people's democratic system. Comrade Nagy attempted to obstruct the driving forces of socialist construction, especially the development of heavy industry, and in rural areas, he attempted to obstruct the cooperative movement of production which is the decisive means of socialist transformation in rural areas. He attempted to relegate the leading role of the Party to a secondary position and weaken this role, and to set the state organs and partly the Patriotic People's Front against the Party. All these actions of Comrade I. Nagy hindered the laying of a solid foundation for improving the people's welfare.

　　Comrade I. Nagy's anti-Marxist, anti-Leninist, and anti-Party views have a complete system and involve all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life. Comrade Nagy's activities have brought great harm to our Party, the people's democratic system, and the entire socialist construction cause of our country.

　　In order to realize his right-leaning opportunist policies, Comrade Nagy adopted anti-Party, and even factional, methods that are incompatible with the discipline and unity of a Marxist-Leninist party.

　　In view of all this, the Central Committee decided to expel Comrade Nagy from the Political Bureau and the Central Committee and remove him from all positions entrusted to him by the Party.

　　In view of the fact that Mihály Farkas had long supported Comrade Nagy's erroneous views, the Central Committee decided to remove him from his positions in the Political Bureau and the Secretariat, and transfer him to other Party work.

　　The Central Committee unanimously elected Comrade István Kovács and Comrade József Mekis to be members of the Political Bureau, and Comrade László Piros to be an alternate member of the Political Bureau.

    匈牙利劳动人民党中央全体会议通过决议
    决定把纳吉开除出中央委员会并解除他在党内的一切职务
    新华社布拉格十九日电　布达佩斯消息：匈牙利“自由人民报”报道，匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会在十四日举行全体会议。会议一致通过决议如下：
    匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会查明：身为匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会政治局委员和匈牙利人民共和国部长会议主席的伊姆雷·纳吉同志，抱有同我们党的全部政策，同工人阶级、劳动农民和人民民主制度的利益针锋相对的政治观点。纳吉同志力图阻挠社会主义建设的推动力量，特别是重工业的发展，在农村力图阻挠作为农村社会主义改造的决定性手段的生产合作运动。他力图把党的领导作用排挤到次要地位和减弱这种作用，并且把国家机关和部分地把爱国人民阵线同党对立起来。伊·纳吉同志的这一切行为阻碍了为增进人民福利奠定巩固的基础。
    伊·纳吉同志的这种反马克思主义、反列宁主义和反党的观点，具有一套完整的体系，并且涉及到政治、经济和文化生活的各个方面。纳吉同志的活动给我们党、人民民主制度和我国整个社会主义建设事业带来了巨大的损害。
    纳吉同志为了实现自己的右倾机会主义政策，采取了同马克思列宁主义政党的纪律和统一不相容的反党的，甚至是派别活动的方法。
    中央委员会鉴于这一切，决定把纳吉同志开除出政治局和中央委员会，并解除党交托给他的一切职务。
    鉴于米哈伊·法卡斯长期支持纳吉同志的错误观点，中央委员会决定解除他在政治局和书记处的职务，而调他担任党的其他工作。
    中央委员会一致选举伊斯特万·科瓦奇同志和约瑟夫·麦基什同志为政治局委员，拉斯洛·彼罗什同志为政治局候补委员。
