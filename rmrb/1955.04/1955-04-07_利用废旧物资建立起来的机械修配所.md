    Mechanical Repair Shop Established Using Waste Materials
    Yang Gaowen
    The Shanxi Provincial Handicraft Production Cooperative Union has established a mechanical repair shop using waste materials cleared from state warehouses. It has become the core force for Shanxi Province's handicraft production cooperatives to gradually move towards semi-mechanization and mechanization.

    In April 1954, Shanxi Province cleared out a batch of waste materials. These waste materials were of various types and conditions. Among them were various metal cutting machine tools, motors, diesel engines, water pumps and various knitting and textile machine parts, communication equipment, small hardware, and steel raw materials, totaling more than 9,000 kinds, all of which were left over after selection by various professional companies. Due to the high degree of obsolescence, most of the materials were difficult to put into production in a timely manner, and disposal was very difficult. Later, it was felt that the handicraft production cooperative had a rather complex industry, large in number, and varied in size, so it was very suitable to use these materials. They handed over this batch of materials to the Provincial Handicraft Cooperative Union.

    After accepting this batch of materials, the Shanxi Provincial Handicraft Production Cooperative Union held a symposium on the disposal of materials with representatives from various special zones, cities, and key counties. At the meeting, the representatives from various regions checked the material inventory, and put forward the varieties and quantities of materials needed, with great interest. However, after visiting the warehouse on the spot, everyone disliked the old materials. Some reduced the quantity they needed, and some proposed not to take them at all. The Shanxi Provincial Handicraft Production Cooperative Union re-explained the significance of the state's support for handicraft production cooperatives with materials, and after reversing everyone's idea of "using new instead of old," the representatives from various regions requested the Shanxi Provincial Handicraft Production Cooperative Union to be responsible for signing contracts with various factories to repair this batch of machines. The Shanxi Provincial Handicraft Production Cooperative Union immediately contacted factories such as Shanxi Machine Factory and Mining Machine Factory, requesting processing and repair. However, some factories replied: "In order to support the development of handicraft cooperation, repairs should be carried out. However, due to the large task of our factory, it cannot be repaired in 1954. In 1955, a plan must be drawn up early, otherwise it will not be included in the queue." Some factories even said: "We would rather manufacture a few new lathes for the cooperative than repair old ones." Based on these circumstances, the Shanxi Provincial Handicraft Production Cooperative Union believed that in order to make the most of the waste materials and put them into production quickly, without continuing to stockpile them and without increasing costs, it was necessary to think of another way.

    At that time, there were more than 1,200 handicraft production cooperatives in Shanxi Province. Among them, the iron and mining production cooperatives had more machine equipment. When machine damage occurred, and large factories were contracted for repair, delays often occurred, affecting production, which became a difficult problem to solve for handicraft cooperatives on the road to semi-mechanization and mechanization. The Shanxi Provincial Handicraft Production Cooperative Union considered that as the semi-mechanization and mechanization of handicrafts continued to develop, similar problems would increase day by day. Therefore, it decided to rely on the waste materials received from the inventory clearing, adopt the principle of gradual development from small to large, and establish a mechanical repair shop by the Provincial Handicraft Cooperative Union; and determined that the task of the mechanical repair shop was to face the grassroots societies, repair machines for the grassroots societies, and through repair business, quickly dispose of the materials allocated by the state, so that the mechanical repair shop became the core force for handicrafts to gradually move towards semi-mechanization and mechanization.

    In early September 1954, with the approval of the higher authorities and the support of the local government, the Shanxi Provincial Handicraft Production Cooperative Union began to prepare for the establishment of a mechanical repair shop. By October 1, it had repaired two lathes and put them into production. By the end of December, the mechanical repair shop had repaired 15 various machine tools, 2 diesel engines, 2 electric rollers, and overhauled and minor repaired 6 cars. Although these repaired waste machines cannot be compared with new machines, they are already good equipment for replacing manual operation.

    These repaired machines were equipped for ten grassroots handicraft production cooperatives in the iron, mining, and sulfur industries, turning waste materials into useful production equipment, giving play to the potential power of the materials, and improving the production of the grassroots societies.

    利用废旧物资建立起来的机械修配所
    杨高文
    山西省手工业生产合作社联合社利用国家清理仓库中清理出的废旧物资，建立了一个机械修配所。它已成为山西省手工业生产合作社逐步走上半机械化和机械化道路的核心力量。
    一九五四年四月，山西省清理出一批废旧物资。这批废旧物资种类复杂，好坏不一。其中有各式金属切削机床、马达、柴油机、水泵和各种针织、纺织机件，通讯器材、小五金、钢铁原材料共九千余种，都是各专业公司挑选后剩余下来的。由于废旧程度较大，多数物资很难及时投入生产，处理很困难。后来感到手工业生产合作社的行业相当复杂，数量多，而且大小不一，利用这些物资倒是很适宜的。他们就把这批物资交给省手工业合作社联合社。
    山西省手工业生产合作社联合社接受了这批物资后，召开了有各专区、市、重点县代表参加的处理物资座谈会。会上各地代表查阅了物资清册，提出了需要物资的品种，数量，兴趣很大，但一到仓库实地参观后，大家都嫌旧，有的将所需要的数量减少了，有的提出根本不要。山西省手工业生产合作社联合社把国家以物资扶植手工业生产合作社的意义再次作了解释，扭转了大家“用新不用旧”的思想后，各地代表又要求山西省手工业生产合作社联合社负责同各工厂签订合同，整修这批机器。山西省手工业生产合作社联合社即同山西机器厂，矿山机器厂等工厂联系，要求加工修理，但有的厂回答说：“为了扶植手工业合作化的发展，应予整修，但因本厂任务大，一九五四年不能修理，一九五五年还得早编计划，迟则排不进队”，有的厂甚至说：“宁愿给合作社制造几部新车床，也不愿修理破旧的”。根据这些情况，山西省手工业生产合作社联合社认为要尽量利用废旧物资，并能很快地投入生产，不使继续积压下去，又不加大成本，必须再想办法。
    当时，山西省有一千二百多个手工业生产合作社，其中铁业、矿业生产合作社的机器设备较多，遇到机器损坏，交由大工厂承修时，也常发生拖延时间，影响生产的情形，成为手工业合作社在半机械化和机械化道路上难以解决的一个问题。山西省手工业生产合作社联合社考虑到随着手工业半机械化和机械化的继续发展，类似的问题会日益增多，就确定依靠接收的废旧清仓物资，采取由小到大，逐步发展的方针，由省手工业合作社联合社创办一个机械修配所；并确定机械修配所的任务是面向基层社，为基层社整修机器，通过修配业务，迅速处理国家交拨的物资，使机械修配所成为手工业逐步走上半机械化和机械化道路的核心力量。
    一九五四年九月初，山西省手工业生产合作社联合社取得上级的同意和当地政府的支持，着手筹备建立机械修配所，到十月一日即修好了两部车床投入生产。至十二月底止，机械修配所修好了各式机床十五台，柴油机两部，电滚两部，大修和小修汽车六辆。这些已修好的废旧机器，虽然不能同新机器相比，但用在代替手工操作上，已是很好的设备了。
    这些修理好的机器，共装备了铁业、矿业和硫磺业的十个基层手工业生产合作社，使废旧的东西变成有用的生产设备，发挥了物资的潜在力量，提高了基层社的生产。
