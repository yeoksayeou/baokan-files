Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, April 11th: According to TASS, Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser continued talks with Pakistani Governor-General Ghulam Muhammad and Prime Minister Muhammad Ali in Karachi on April 10th. Nasser arrived in Karachi on the 9th en route to Indonesia to attend the Asian-African Conference.

Muhammad Ali told reporters that the discussions involved issues in the Middle East and issues related to the international situation. Well-informed sources believe that the talks covered such issues as the Turkish-Iraqi military alliance and Pakistan's plan to join it, the establishment of a Middle East bloc, and the attitudes of Pakistan and Egypt at the Asian-African Conference.

Egyptian Minister of National Guidance, Sala Salem, stated at a press conference held in Karachi on April 10th that Egypt does not consider it appropriate to participate in any military alliances being established by Western countries. Salem emphasized that Pakistan and Egypt are adopting different strategies in their foreign policies.

Editorials in Karachi newspapers show that Pakistan is dissatisfied with Egypt's attitude towards the establishment of a bloc in the Middle East and is trying to change it. The official newspaper of the Pakistan Muslim League, "Pakistan Flag," said that it is dissatisfied with Egypt's intention to pursue a policy of neutrality and not participate in any military blocs and alliances in Asia.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 11th: Karachi dispatch: Egyptian Minister of National Guidance, Salem, told reporters in Karachi on April 10th that Egypt opposes joining military treaties. Salem said: Joining military treaties "is incompatible with Egypt's interests." He said that the purpose of such military treaties—especially the Turkish-Iraqi treaty—"is to create divisions among Arab countries."

    纳赛尔同巴基斯坦当局会谈
    萨勒姆表示埃及反对参加军事条约
    新华社十二日讯　据塔斯社喀喇蚩十一日讯：埃及总理纳赛尔四月十日在喀喇蚩继续同巴基斯坦总督吴拉姆·穆罕默德和总理穆罕默德·阿里进行会谈。纳赛尔是在去印度尼西亚参加亚非会议途中在九日到达喀喇蚩的。
    穆罕默德·阿里对记者们说，这些商谈涉及中东诸问题以及同国际形势有关的问题。据通常消息灵通的人士认为，会谈讨论了这样一些问题：土耳其—伊拉克军事联盟和巴基斯坦计划加入这个联盟问题，建立中东集团问题，巴基斯坦和埃及在亚非会议上的态度问题等。
    埃及国家指导部长赛拉·萨勒姆四月十日在喀喇蚩举行的记者招待会上说，埃及并不认为它参加西方国家正在建立的任何军事联盟是合适的。萨勒姆强调说，巴基斯坦和埃及在它们的外交政策上正采取着不同的策略。
    喀喇蚩报纸的社论表明，巴基斯坦不满埃及对于在中东建立集团所持的态度，并且竭力想要改变这种态度，巴基斯坦回教联盟的官方报纸“巴基斯坦旗报”说，它不满埃及的这种意图：奉行一种中立的并且不参加亚洲的任何军事集团和联盟的政策。
    据新华社新德里十一日讯　喀喇蚩消息：埃及国家指导部长萨勒姆四月十日在喀喇蚩对记者们发表谈话说，埃及反对加入军事条约。萨勒姆说：加入军事条约“是同埃及的利益不相容的。”他说，这种军事条约——特别是土耳其伊拉克条约——的目的“是要在阿拉伯国家中间制造分裂”。
