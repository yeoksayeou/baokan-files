    Postal and telecommunications institutions have been widely established in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region of Xikang Province by the end of 1954. Before liberation, only Zhaojue County had postal and telecommunications facilities in the Yi-inhabited areas, handling only a few letters a day. Now, mail and telegrams can reach all counties in the region. Remote areas such as Puxiong, which were isolated from the outside world before liberation, also established post and telecommunications bureaus in January 1954. Now, they can read the "People's Daily" from Beijing every ten days or so. The Zhaojue County Post and Telecommunications Bureau handles an average of more than 2,000 letters per day and distributes more than 100 kinds of newspapers and periodicals in Han and Yi languages. In addition, all seven counties in the autonomous region, except Puge County, have installed wired telephones. The Yi people are particularly excited about the telephone, which has appeared in Liangshan for the first time in history, and they often talk to their children who are studying in Ya'an, Chengdu and other places by telephone.

    凉山人民有了邮政电讯设备
    西康省凉山彝族自治区到一九五四年底止，普遍建立了邮政电讯机构。解放以前，在彝民聚居区里，仅昭觉县设有邮电机构，每天经办几封信件。现在，邮件电报可通达全区各县。解放以前和外界隔绝的普雄等偏僻地区，也在一九五四年一月设立了邮电局，最多隔十来天就可以看到北京的“人民日报”。昭觉县邮电局经办的信件，平均每天达两千件以上，发行的汉文、彝文报刊有一百多种。这以外，自治区七个县除了普格县，都已经架设了有线电话。彝族人民对于大凉山历史上第一次出现的电话特别感到兴奋，他们常和自己在雅安、成都等地学习的子弟用电话交谈。　（程里）
