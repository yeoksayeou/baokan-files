The North Fei River upper reaches dredging project has been completed. On March 26th, water flowed through the entire dredged waterway.

The North Fei River irrigation and drainage area has low-lying terrain and winding river channels. Before liberation, the river's drainage system was badly damaged, and floods often occurred. In the spring of 1953, the Huai River Harnessing Committee began to manage the North Fei River. Before the flood season in 1954, projects such as excavating the New Fei River and Qinggou River, dredging the Xie River, and constructing the Mohekou Sluice Gate and New Fei Sluice Gate had been completed, greatly improving the original drainage situation. During the extraordinary floods of 1954, the harvest of hundreds of thousands of mu of farmland in the middle reaches of the North Fei River was protected. Now, the dredging project of the upper reaches of the North Fei River has also been completed, and more than 700,000 mu of farmland on both banks of the upper reaches can also avoid flood disasters.

The vast number of migrant workers demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm in the project of dredging the upper reaches of the North Fei River and overcame the difficulties of excessive rain and snow during the construction period. The migrant workers of the Fifth Brigade researched the "hollowing out and cutting off" method to excavate large sand and gravel layers, increasing the work efficiency per person per day from 1.3 cubic meters to more than 2 cubic meters. The migrant workers of the Eighth Brigade used the "borrowing soil and returning soil" method to overcome the difficulty of loading and transporting thin mud.

### 北淝河上游疏浚工程完工

    北淝河上游疏浚工程完工
    北淝河上游疏浚工程完工。三月二十六日，疏浚过的河道已全道通水。
    北淝河排灌区地势低洼，河道弯曲，解放前这条河的排水系统毁坏不堪，时常发生涝灾。一九五三年春季，治淮委员会就开始治理北淝河。到一九五四年汛期前，已完成了开挖新淝河、青沟河，疏浚澥河，建筑沫河口节制闸、新淝闸等工程，大大改善了原有的排水情况，在一九五四年特大洪水侵袭下，保护了北淝河中游数十万亩农田的收成。现在，北淝河上游疏浚工程又已竣工，上游两岸的七十多万亩农田，也可避免涝灾。
    广大民工在疏浚北淝河上游的工程中，发挥了高度的劳动积极性，克服了施工期中雨雪过多的困难。第五大队民工研究出“掏空截断”的办法开挖大砂礓盘，使每人每天的工作效率由一点三公方提高到二公方以上。第八大队的民工用“借土还土”的办法，克服了稀泥不好装运的困难。
