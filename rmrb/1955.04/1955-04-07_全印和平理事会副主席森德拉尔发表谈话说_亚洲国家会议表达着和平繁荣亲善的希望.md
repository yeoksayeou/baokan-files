Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 6th. All-India Peace Council Vice-Chairman Sundarlal told reporters in New Delhi on the 5th that the Asian Countries Conference to be held in New Delhi from April 6th to 10th "is of utmost importance and filled with hopes for establishing peace, prosperity, and goodwill in the world."

Sundarlal said that Asian countries currently have many common problems. In the past two or three hundred years, they have all been more or less subjected to Western aggression, and some countries are still suffering from Western aggression. Certain Western countries have been ruling and exploiting Asian countries and are still trying to continue their rule and exploitation. Their forte is setting one people against another. This aggressive policy of the West can be clearly seen throughout Asia at present. Therefore, at this moment, it is extremely important that Asian peoples with various opinions gather together to discuss their common problems and try to deal with this danger from the West with a united attitude.

Sundarlal said that Asia has always supported world peace, the freedom, progress, and prosperity of the people of all countries in the world, and the unity of mankind. Asia's ideal has always been that human beings should live together as a family.

    全印和平理事会副主席森德拉尔发表谈话说
    亚洲国家会议表达着和平繁荣亲善的希望
    新华社新德里六日电　全印和平理事会副主席森德拉尔五日在新德里向记者发表谈话说，即将从四月六日到十日在新德里举行的亚洲国家会议“具有头等重要意义，并且充满着在世界上建立和平、繁荣和亲善的希望。”
   森德拉尔说，亚洲各国目前有着许多共同的问题。在过去二三百年中，它们都或多或少地受到西方的侵略，其中有些国家目前仍然在受着西方的侵略。某些西方国家一直在对亚洲国家进行统治和剥削，并且目前仍然在设法继续它们的统治和剥削。使一国人民反对另一国人民是它们的拿手好戏。西方的这种侵略政策目前可以清楚地在亚洲各地看出。因此，在目前这个时刻，抱着各种不同见解的亚洲各国人民齐集一堂来讨论它们的共同问题，并设法以团结一致的态度来对付来自西方的这种危险，是极其重要的。
    森德拉尔说，亚洲一向拥护世界和平，拥护世界各国人民的自由、进步和繁荣，拥护人类的团结一致。亚洲的理想一向是人类应该像一家人一样地共同在一起生活。
