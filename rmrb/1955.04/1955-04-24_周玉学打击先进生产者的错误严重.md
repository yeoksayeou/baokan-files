To the Editor:

I am a worker at the Mechanical Wood Factory of the Second Engineering Company of the Heilongjiang Provincial Construction Department. In 1954, with the help of comrades, I used waste products such as sawdust and coal cinder to research and trial-produce products such as "August 1st Boards" and "Heilong Tiles" to replace wood and cement. These products have very low costs and have characteristics such as fire prevention, moisture prevention, and sound insulation. More than 20,000 Heilong tiles have already been made and used to cover houses.

The research and trial production of new products was led by Hao Guangnong, the director of our factory. During the research and trial production of the new products, I repeatedly asked Zhou Yuxue, the secretary of our factory's general Party branch, for help. However, because he had a principled dispute with Factory Director Hao Guangnong, he not only did not support me, but also poured cold water on me, and sarcastically said, "What are you fussing about if there's no scientific basis, just pack it up." "Don't waste your energy, it's alright if it doesn't work out!" Because of this matter, I have raised my opinions to him several times, and he has become even more dissatisfied with me, falsely accusing me of belonging to Factory Director Hao Guangnong's small clique and plotting to frame me. He removed me from my positions as propagandist and leader of the propaganda team. During the evaluation of model workers in our factory in the winter of 1954, thirty-five candidates were initially selected, and I was ranked first. Later, fifteen candidates were selected from the thirty-five, and I was again ranked first. But in the end, Zhou Yuxue removed my name from the list of candidates without any reason. He also pinned a big label on me, saying that I had a problem with my history. I believe that the nature of Zhou Yuxue's mistake is serious. I want to resolutely fight against this wrong behavior.

### 周玉学打击先进生产者的错误严重

    周玉学打击先进生产者的错误严重编辑同志：
    我是黑龙江省建设厅第二工程公司机械木工厂的工人。一九五四年在同志们的帮助下，我曾利用锯末、煤灰渣等废品，研究试制了八一板、黑龙瓦等产品，以代替木材和水泥。这些产品的成本很低，并具有防火、防潮、隔音等特点。现在已制出两万多块黑龙瓦盖上房子了。
    新产品的研究试制工作是我厂郝光农厂长领导的。在研究试制新产品的过程中，我几次要求我厂党总支书记周玉学给我帮助，可是因为他和郝光农闹无原则纠纷，不但不支持我，反而泼冷水，并讽刺我说：“没有一点科学根据还钻什么牛角尖，收拾摊子算了。”“你不要白费这股劲，不行就算啦！”为了这件事，我曾几次向他提出意见，他就更加对我不满了，诬我属于郝光农厂长的小集团并阴谋陷害我。他撤掉了我的宣传员和宣传员小组长的工作。在一九五四年冬季我厂评选模范时，初次选出三十五名候选人，我是第一名。后来又从三十五名中选出十五名候选人，我又是第一名。但到最后周玉学就无故把我的名字从候选人名单中去掉了。还给我扣上个大帽子，说我历史有问题。我认为周玉学所犯错误的性质是严重的。我要向这种错误行为进行坚决斗争。　陈应才
