    Pay Attention to Safeguarding Certificates and Documents
    To the Editor:
    "Loss Statements" are appearing in almost every newspaper every day, which is a problem that deserves attention.
    According to my not-so-accurate statistics, the Tianjin Daily had about 500 "Loss Statements" in February (losing one item counts as one), and the Guangming Daily also reached more than 270 in the same month; on February 20th alone, Tianjin Third Municipal Middle School placed an advertisement declaring the loss of as many as 81 school badges. The lost items include dozens of types of badges, work permits, entry permits, trade union membership cards, public medical cards, grain purchase certificates, household registration transfer certificates, household registration books, etc., with the loss of badges and certificates being the most common. This careless loss of one's own badges and certificates should be seen as a manifestation of political apathy.
    In the movie "斩断魔爪" (Cut Off the Devil's Claws), we saw how special agents used other people's documents to infiltrate our factories and carry out sabotage. How can we guarantee that the documents lost by these comrades will not fall into the hands of counter-revolutionaries or bad elements?
    I hope that all units will strengthen education for their members and eliminate the loss of documents.

### 注意保管证章证件

    注意保管证章证件编辑同志：
    “遗失声明”的广告，在很多报纸上差不多天天都有，这是一个值得重视的问题。
    据我不很准确的统计，二月份的天津日报“遗失声明”达五百起左右（遗失一件东西算一起），同月份的光明日报也达到二百七十起以上；仅二月二十日天津市立第三中学的一次广告就声明遗失校徽八十一枚之多。遗失的东西包括徽章、工作证、出入证、工会会员证、公费医疗证、购粮证、户口迁移证、户口册等几十种，其中以遗失证章、证件者为最多。这种对自己的证章、证件随便丢失的情况，应当看做是政治麻痹的表现。
    在电影“斩断魔爪”里，我们看到了特务如何利用他人的证件，混入我们的工厂进行破坏。我们又怎能保证这些同志遗失的证件就准不落到反革命分子或坏分子的手里去呢？
    我希望各单位对所属成员加强教育，杜绝这种丢失证件的事情。
