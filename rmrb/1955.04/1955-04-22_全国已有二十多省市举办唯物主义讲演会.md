More than twenty provinces and cities across the country have begun holding lectures on materialism.

Currently, twenty-five provinces and cities nationwide, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Hebei, Shandong, Guizhou, Rehe, Shaanxi, Anhui, Hunan, Sichuan, Hubei, Qinghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Gansu, Liaoning, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Henan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Inner Mongolia, have successively started offering lectures on materialism. In addition to planning lectures in provincial capitals, various regions will also establish lectures in many medium-sized cities. For example: South China has eleven cities including Guilin; Jiangsu has seven cities including Xuzhou; Anhui has four cities including Bengbu; Jiangxi has two cities including Ganzhou; Liaoning has nine cities including Anshan; Shaanxi has three cities including Baoji; Gansu has nine special districts including Jiuquan; Shanxi has three cities including Datong; Henan has five cities including Luoyang; and Hebei has four cities including Baoding. It is estimated that the number of attendees will be 230,000 in Beijing, 200,000 in Shanghai, 500,000 in Anhui, 200,000 in Liaoning, 110,000 in Shanxi, 100,000 in Tianjin, 40,000 in Hunan, 20,000 in Guizhou, and 50,000 in Gansu.

Lectures are generally scheduled once or twice a month, each lasting two to three hours. Lectures are held during leisure time, and attendance is organized on a voluntary basis.

To improve the quality of the lectures, Party committees in various regions have adopted many specific measures. Beijing's approach is to have senior lecturers provide popular guidance reports to the lecturers first, who then disseminate the information downwards. Shanxi, Henan, the South China Sub-bureau, the Inner Mongolia Eastern District Party Committee, and others have established lecturer groups. Guizhou, Hunan, Gansu, Yunnan, and Liaoning have established lecture research groups. Qinghai stipulates that lecture drafts should be discussed in senior group seminars before being presented to everyone. Zhejiang plans to concentrate lecturers for lesson preparation. Shaanxi and Hunan stipulate that lecture drafts should be reviewed by the Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department. Jiangsu plans to first send municipal propaganda ministers to the province for two weeks to study philosophy, and plans to hold philosophy teacher training courses at the provincial Party school to cultivate lecturers for the counties. Many responsible cadres also personally participate in the lectures. For example, Huang Oudong, Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee, and Zhang Chengxian, Deputy Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, have both undertaken lecturing work.

Party committees in various regions also pay attention to organizing newspapers, radio stations, and publishing houses to cooperate with the publicity of materialism.

The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to conduct materialism propaganda among cadres participating in senior group studies in Beijing (including departments directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, departments directly under the Central People's Government, military organs stationed in Beijing, and Beijing municipal organs), has decided to hold a lecture series on "Promoting Materialism and Criticizing Idealist Thought." The preliminary plan for this lecture series is to hold four lectures from April to July, once a month. Comrades Zhou Yang, Yang Xianzhen, Hu Sheng, and Ai Siqi have been invited to give lectures on the following four topics: (1) Why is it necessary to criticize idealism and promote materialism? (2) What is dialectical materialism? (3) Critique of Hu Shih's thought; (4) Critique of Hu Feng's thought.

Each lecture is expected to attract 5,000 listeners, who will listen simultaneously in the Huairen Hall and several other auditoriums. Participation in the lectures is based on the principle of voluntarism.

The first lecture is scheduled for April 23rd and will be given by Comrade Hu Sheng on "Why is it Necessary to Criticize Idealism and Promote Materialism."

The Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Higher Education, and the Beijing Municipal Committee of Higher Education of the Communist Party of China, in order to more broadly meet the needs of natural scientists and university teachers in Beijing to study Marxist-Leninist philosophy, have decided to expand the philosophy report meetings originally held independently by the Natural Scientists' Marxist-Leninist Study Committee into dialectical materialism lectures jointly organized by the three units, starting this month. After the expansion, each lecture can accommodate about 3,500 listeners. Participants include natural scientists in Beijing and teachers from Beijing universities. It is planned to hold one lecture per month, organized on a voluntary basis by relevant units. Comrades Chen Boda, Zhou Yang, Hu Sheng, Ai Siqi, and Sun Dingguo have been appointed as the main lecturers. The preliminary topics determined include: "Why is it Necessary to Promote Materialism and Criticize Bourgeois Idealism," "Critique of Hu Shih's Philosophical Thought," "Critique of Hu Shih's Pragmatist Methodology," "Critique of Hu Feng's Thought," as well as "What is Dialectical Materialism" and "What is Materialist Dialectics."

The first lecture was held on the 2nd of this month, with Comrade Ai Siqi giving a report on "Critique of Hu Shih's Philosophical Thought." The second lecture (the first after the expansion into a lecture series) is scheduled for April 23rd, with Comrade Sun Dingguo lecturing on "Critique of Hu Shih's Pragmatist Methodology."

    全国已有二十多省市举办唯物主义讲演会
    目前全国已有北京、上海、天津、广州、河北、山东、贵州、热河、陕西、安徽、湖南、四川、湖北、青海、江苏、浙江、甘肃、辽宁、云南、江西、山西、河南、广东、广西、内蒙古等二十五个省市先后开始举办唯物主义讲座。各地除计划在省会所在地举办讲座外，并将在许多中等城市设立讲座。如：华南有桂林等十一个市；江苏有徐州等七个市；安徽有蚌埠等四个市；江西有赣州等二市；辽宁有鞍山等九个市；陕西有宝鸡等三个市；甘肃有酒泉等九个专区；山西有大同等三个市；河南有洛阳等五个市；河北有保定等四个市。预计参加听讲的人数北京二十三万人；上海二十万人；安徽五十万人；辽宁二十万人；山西十一万人；天津十万人；湖南四万人；贵州二万人；甘肃五万人。
    讲演次数一般规定每月一至二次，每次二至三小时。讲演在业余时间举行，并按自愿原则组织听讲。
    为了提高讲演质量，各地党委都采取了许多具体措施。北京市的办法是先由大报告员向报告员进行通俗辅导报告，然后由报告员向下传达；山西、河南、华南分局，内蒙东部区党委等均成立了讲师团；贵州、湖南、甘肃、云南、辽宁等均成立了演讲研究组；青海规定讲稿先在高级组讨论会上进行讨论，而后再向大家报告；浙江计划把讲师集中进行备课；陕西、湖南规定讲稿应经省委宣传部审查；江苏计划先抽市宣传部长到省学习两周哲学，并计划在省党校举办哲学教员训练班以培养县的讲演者。不少负责干部还亲自参加讲演。如中共辽宁省委书记黄欧东，河北省委副书记张承先都担任了讲演工作。
    各地党委并注意组织报社、广播电台、出版社配合唯物主义宣传。
    中国共产党中央宣传部为了对在北京各机关参加高级组学习的干部（包括中共中央直属机关、中央人民政府直属机关、驻京军事机关及北京市机关等）进行唯物主义宣传，决定举办“宣传唯物主义、批判唯心主义思想”的演讲会。这个演讲会初步计划自四月至七月举办讲演四次，每月一次，现已聘请周扬、杨献珍、胡绳、艾思奇等同志分别主讲以下四个题目：（一）为什么要批判唯心主义、宣传唯物主义；（二）什么是辩证唯物主义；（三）胡适思想批判；（四）胡风思想批判。
    这个讲演会每次准备吸收听众五千人，在怀仁堂和其它几个礼堂同时听讲，参加听讲以自愿为原则。
    第一次讲演定四月二十三日举行。由胡绳同志讲“为什么要批判唯心主义、宣传唯物主义”。
    中国科学院、高等教育部和中共北京市高等学校委员会为了更广泛地满足在北京的自然科学家和高等学校教师学习马克思列宁主义哲学的要求，决定自本月起将原来由自然科学家马克思列宁主义学委会单独举办的哲学报告会，扩大为三个单位联合举办的辩证唯物主义讲座。扩大以后的讲座，每次可容纳听众三千五百人左右，参加听讲的除在京自然科学家外，还包括北京高等学校的教师。计划每月举办讲演一次，按自愿原则，由有关单位分别组织听讲。该讲座已聘定陈伯达、周扬、胡绳、艾思奇、孙定国等同志为主讲人，初步确定的讲题有：
  “为什么要宣传唯物主义、批判资产阶级唯心主义”“胡适哲学思想批判”“胡适实用主义方法论批判”“胡风思想批判”以及“什么是辩证唯物主义”“什么是唯物辩证法”等。
    第一次讲演业已在本月二日举行，由艾思奇同志作了“批判胡适哲学思想”的报告。第二次讲演（扩大为讲座后的第一次）定本月二十三日举行，由孙定国同志讲“批判胡适实用主义方法论”。
