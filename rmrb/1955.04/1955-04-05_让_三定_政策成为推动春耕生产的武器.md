    Let the "Three Fixes" Policy Become a Weapon to Promote Spring Ploughing Production
    Wang Xing
    In the process of implementing the "Fixed Production, Fixed Purchase, and Fixed Sales" policy for grain in various regions, we have seen the following situation: many agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers have understood the spirit of this policy and have come to study the original production plans they had formulated: some have appropriately increased the original planned production increase targets, and some have solidified the plans that were not precise enough. The "Three Fixes" policy has directly promoted the current spring ploughing production activities in vast areas. However, there are also some agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, or individual farmers who, upon hearing the publicity about the "Three Fixes" policy, do not consider how to increase production at all, and even openly or secretly reduce their production plans. They want to use this method to retain more grain during the autumn unified purchase. Of course, these are only individual phenomena. However, since this phenomenon has occurred in many provinces and regions, it should be noted.
    The basic spirit of the "Three Fixes" policy is to encourage farmers to develop production freely and to help farmers rationally arrange their production and life. We must repeatedly publicize this principle to farmers, so that farmers understand that developing production is a fundamental plan and the most effective way to solve the food problem. The state's unified purchase task is limited, while production can continue to grow. The more production develops, the lighter the unified purchase task will become in comparison. The state's needs will be reliably guaranteed, and the expanded reproduction of agriculture and the living standards of farmers can be gradually improved. Some people, in the process of implementing the "Three Fixes" policy, do not publicize these fundamental principles to farmers, but instead rigidly adhere to the numbers of "production," "purchase," and "sales"; they do not help farmers arrange production, but only assign tasks to farmers, resulting in not stabilizing the farmers' emotions, but instead increasing their concerns. This is very wrong.
    The "Three Fixes" policy is a major step in gradually institutionalizing the unified purchase and sales policy. When implementing the "Three Fixes" policy, it is necessary to publicize to farmers the benefits of unified grain purchase and sales for the country and for farmers, and, based on the actual situation of the local area, check and correct the shortcomings in the implementation of the unified purchase and sales policy (if there are any shortcomings), explaining that the implementation of the "Three Fixes" policy is precisely to overcome those shortcomings, and thus improve the unified grain purchase and sales work. Some people have not understood the relationship between the two at all. In order to emphasize the role of the "Three Fixes" policy, they intentionally or unintentionally belittle or distort the unified purchase and sales policy, creating a bad impression. This practice is very wrong and must be corrected immediately.

    让“三定”政策成为推动春耕生产的武器
    王星
    在各地贯彻粮食“定产、定购、定销”政策的过程中，我们看到了这样的情形：许多农业生产合作社、互助组和单干农民体会这个政策的精神，就来研究原来拟定的生产计划：有的适当地提高了原订的增产指标，有的把不够精确的计划订实了。“三定”政策在广大地区直接推动了当前的春耕生产活动。可是，也有些农业生产合作社、互助组或单干农民，听到关于“三定”政策的宣传，根本不去考虑怎样提高生产，甚至公开地或暗暗地把生产计划降低了。它们想用这种方法在秋季统购时多留一些粮食。当然，这只是一些个别的现象。但是，由于许多省区都发生了这种现象，所以应该加以注意。
    “三定”政策的基本精神是鼓舞农民放手发展生产，帮助农民合理地安排自己的生产和生活。我们必须反复向农民宣传这个道理，使农民懂得发展生产是根本大计，是解决粮食问题的最有效的办法。国家的统购任务是有限度的，而生产却能不断地增长。生产越是发展，相形之下，统购任务越会减轻，国家的需要既获得可靠的保证，农业的扩大再生产和农民的生活水平又能逐步提高。有一些人，在贯彻“三定”政策的过程中，不向农民宣传这些根本的道理，而是死扣“产”、“购”、“销”的数字；不帮助农民安排生产，只向农民分配任务，结果没有安定农民的情绪，反而增加了农民的顾虑，这是非常错误的。
    “三定”政策是使统购统销政策逐步走上制度化的一个重大步骤。在实现“三定”政策的时候，必须向农民宣传粮食统购统销对国家、对农民的好处，并根据当地的实际情况，检查和纠正统购统销政策执行中的缺点（如果有缺点的话），说明实行“三定”政策正是为了克服那些缺点，因而把粮食统购统销工作办得更好。有些人根本没有弄清楚两者的关系，为了强调“三定”政策的作用，竟有意无意地贬低或歪曲统购统销政策，造成不好的印象。这种作法是很错误的，必须立即加以纠正。
