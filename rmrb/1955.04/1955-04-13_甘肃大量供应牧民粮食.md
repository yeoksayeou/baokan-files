Gansu Supplies Large Quantities of Grain to Herdsmen

The grain departments in Gansu Province are supplying large quantities of grain to herdsmen in and outside the province's pastoral areas. In the first quarter, the grain departments transported more than 13 million jin of flour, rice, highland barley, and some livestock feed to the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province (near Gansu's border), the Henan Mongol Autonomous County, and Zoigê County and other Tibetan areas in Sichuan Province. Currently, more than 170 trucks are still continuously transporting grain to these areas. According to the grain allocation plan of the Gansu Provincial Grain Bureau, the amount of grain transported to these areas in April will increase by 50% compared to January. (Xinhua News Agency)

    甘肃大量供应牧民粮食
    甘肃省粮食部门大量供应省内外牧业区牧民粮食。在第一季度内，粮食部门已把一千三百多万斤面粉、大米、青稞和一部分牲畜饲料，运往甘南藏族自治区和靠近甘肃省境的青海省海北藏族自治区、河南蒙族自治区以及四川省藏族自治区的若尔盖县等地。目前，一百七十多辆汽车还在陆续不断地向这些地区运粮。根据甘肃省粮食厅的调粮计划，四月份运到这些地区的粮食，将比一月份增加百分之五十。（新华社）
