The just cause of the people of Asian and African countries will surely triumph
Qian Duansheng, Chief Representative of the Chinese Scientists Delegation to the Conference of Indian and Pakistani Scientists

    The representatives of the people of eighteen Asian countries are holding an Asian countries conference in the Indian capital. The Asian-African Conference, with the participation of governments from twenty-nine Asian and African countries, will also be held in Bandung, Indonesia. Although these two meetings are different – one is an assembly of representatives of people from all walks of life in various countries, and the other is a meeting of governments of various countries – the issues discussed are equally in line with the aspirations of the people of the region and are warmly welcomed by the people of various countries. Recently, in order to attend the annual scientific conferences convened by Indian and Pakistani scientists, I visited India and Pakistan, and also passed through Ceylon. At the two scientific conferences, I met scientists from Asian and African countries such as Burma, Indonesia, Japan, and Egypt. Whether among scientists or other people, I deeply felt the friendship between the people of various countries. The people of these countries all demand to enhance friendly cooperation between countries, all demand independence and autonomy, no longer subject to interference and aggression by Western countries, and all demand to build their own countries in a peaceful environment.

    China and India, China and Burma, have a long history of friendly exchanges. It is natural for the people of India and Burma to express great friendship towards us. I am glad to see that the people of Pakistan also welcome us and treat us with the same kindness. Although many Pakistanis asked about the issue of religious freedom, they were without prejudice. I have met Pakistanis who had seen Mr. Da Punsheng's pilgrimage group in 1952 (which was originally going to Mecca for pilgrimage, but only reached Pakistan due to the obstruction of American imperialism), who did not doubt the religious freedom in New China.

    Deep friendship also exists between the people of India and Pakistan. Despite the constant sowing of discord by American imperialism, not only do Indian and Pakistani scientists have a close, familial relationship, but ordinary Indians and ordinary Pakistanis also have no separation. I once saw four or five thousand Indians come to Lahore to watch the India-Pakistan cricket match. The residents of Lahore not only did their best to entertain the Indians, but also asked the government to relax entry restrictions and exempt travelers from household registration procedures. I also saw devout Pakistani Muslims and Indian Sikhs (believers in Sikhism) visiting Pakistan warmly exchanging information about their lives. Therefore, I believe that the natural friendship between the people of India and Pakistan can never be alienated or destroyed by artificial disputes and the activities of the American-organized military groups.

    Friendly relations exist between us and scientists from Burma, Japan, and Egypt, as well as among themselves. Japanese militarist aggression once caused great harm to the people of China and Burma, but at the Indian Science Congress, when Chinese and Burmese scientists took the initiative to express friendship to Japanese scientists, the Japanese scientists no longer felt restrained and agreed that scientists from various countries should strive for mutual visits. Egyptian scientists even hoped to obtain our highly rust-resistant "Bima No. 1" wheat variety for research.

    The people of Asian and African countries have generally experienced imperialist colonial and semi-colonial rule, and have suffered the hardships of imperialist oppression. Therefore, they all cherish independence and autonomy and have a high degree of self-respect. The peace-loving people of India are like this, the people of Egypt who have fought against British colonialism for a long time are like this, and even in Pakistan, which has a military treaty with American imperialism, the people are like this. At the Pakistani Science Congress, an American who claimed to be an agricultural expert arrogantly lectured Pakistanis, saying that Pakistan should not use machines to cultivate land too quickly to avoid rural unemployment. His arrogant remarks aroused the dissatisfaction of the audience and newspaper readers. Even more arrogant was another American "expert." When Pakistani scientists discussed the irrigation problem in a certain area and discussed the utilization of multiple waters – river water, rainwater, and groundwater – he actually rebuked them, saying that there is only one kind of water. Someone in the audience immediately booed and asked sarcastically, "Does 'one kind of water' mean H2O?" Pakistanis told me that Americans have become lords in Pakistan, which has aroused resentment among the Pakistani people.

    The people of Asian and African countries are particularly intolerant of racism, i.e., the theory of superior races. The people of India hate the discrimination of the Union of South Africa against Indian residents in South Africa. The people of Pakistan also have the same hatred. A family member of a capitalist doing business in East Africa told me that although she was a member of the "upper class," although she liked to travel and had been to many places in Africa, she would never go to South Africa. The South African government's policy of discriminating against people of color is indeed evil, but the United States, rampant with the Ku Klux Klan, is the main camp of racism. At the Indian Science Congress, an American biochemist, said to be very famous, named Pauling, openly said: "The hemoglobin molecules in the blood cells of Americans are bipolar, can be polarized, are 'non-homogeneous', are 'normal', and have strong resistance to diseases; the hemoglobin molecules in the blood cells of Indians and blacks are not bipolar, are 'homogeneous', are 'abnormal', and have weak resistance to diseases, so the mortality rate of Indians and blacks is high and their lifespan is short." This is truly a "science" that is superior to Nazi racism! True science is absolutely the opposite. General Sok replied to him: "I studied the problem of hemoglobin molecules eight or nine years ago. The results of my research prove that we Indians and Americans, although living in different regions and eating different foods, the protein molecules in the blood cells of Indians and the protein molecules in the blood cells of Americans are indeed completely the same, without any difference."

    Economic construction is also a common feature I see in South Asian countries. Of course, under different social conditions and actual situations, the direction and speed of economic construction are different, but economic construction is underway in India, Pakistan, and Ceylon. India's agricultural production has increased somewhat, and electricity and irrigation have also developed. The steel plant built with Soviet assistance and the steel plant expanded by India itself will greatly increase India's steel production. The people of Pakistan are extremely concerned about water conservancy construction and the increase of arable land in order to increase food production. Textile factories are also beginning to be established. Pakistan lacks coking coal mines, and scientists are trying to use desulphurization methods to make bad coal applicable to industry. The scientists' hard work is winning people's admiration. Because Pakistan has few industries, the Pakistani people's demand for industrial construction is particularly urgent. In Ceylon, I heard that the funds invested in economic construction have also increased considerably, mainly to expand agricultural production and develop foreign trade, and also to appropriately build some light industries. Comparing today's Colombo with Colombo more than ten years ago, one can indeed see progress in the urban and suburban areas, and see that the people of Ceylon are engaged in construction work.

    The people who have achieved or are striving for independence and are carrying out economic construction must love peace. The people of India, the people of Ceylon, and the scientists from Burma, Indonesia, Japan, and Egypt that I met, unanimously demanded to ease international tensions and maintain peace in Asia, Africa, and the world; the people of Pakistan also have the same demand. Now American imperialism is attempting to use the excuse of "helping" Pakistan establish an atomic research institution and develop atomic energy research to plunder the mineral resources of radioactive elements that may be hidden in Pakistan. But the Pakistani people and the scientific community only hope to develop atomic energy to supply the power that Pakistan currently lacks. They, like the people of India, oppose atomic weapons.

    The visits to South Asian countries and the contact with the people of these countries and the scientists of many Asian and African countries have strengthened my belief that the people of Asian and African countries have a strong and unparalleled demand for the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems and different political systems, because only peaceful coexistence can enhance friendly cooperation between countries, develop cultural and economic mutual assistance, and carry out construction to improve the people's lives. Although American imperialism will not stop creating disputes between countries, provoking relations between countries, interfering in internal affairs under the guise of "aid," organizing aggressive groups in Asian and African countries, and intensifying international tensions through these evil activities to serve its war policy, the will of the people of Asian and African countries to defend peace is firm and the voice is loud. At the Asian countries conference and the Asian-African conference, they will strive to promote the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, promote friendly cooperation between countries, and consolidate peace in Asia and the world.

    亚非国家人民的正义事业必然胜利
    出席印度、巴基斯坦科学家会议  中国科学家代表团首席代表钱端升
    十八个亚洲国家人民的代表正在印度首都举行亚洲国家会议。有二十九个亚非国家的政府参加的亚非会议，也就要在印度尼西亚万隆召开。这两个会议虽然不同，一个是各国各阶层人民的代表的集会，一个是各国政府的会议，但讨论的问题同样是符合这一地区各国人民的愿望，受到各国人民热烈的欢迎的。最近，为了出席印度、巴基斯坦科学家所召开的科学年会，我曾经访问过印度和巴基斯坦，中途也曾经过锡兰。在两个科学年会中，我会见了缅甸、印度尼西亚、日本、埃及等亚非国家的科学家。无论是在科学家或是其他人中，我都深深地体会到各国人民之间的友谊。这些国家的人民都要求增进各国间的友好合作，都要求独立自主，不再受西方国家的干涉和侵略，都要求在和平的环境中建设自己的国家。
    中印、中缅之间，有着悠久的友好往来的历史，印度、缅甸人民对我们表示十分友好是很自然的。我高兴地看到：巴基斯坦人民也同样欢迎我们，同样亲善地对待我们。虽然有不少巴基斯坦人问及宗教自由的问题，但他们是没有成见的。曾见到过一九五二年达浦生先生所率领的朝圣团（这本来是去麦加朝圣的，因受美帝国主义的阻挠，只到了巴基斯坦）的巴基斯坦人，是不怀疑新中国的宗教自由的。
    深厚的友谊，也存在于印、巴人民之间。尽管美帝国主义不断地从中制造不和，不但印、巴科学家之间有着亲如一家人的关系，普通的印度人和普通的巴基斯坦人之间也是没有隔阂的。我曾经看到四、五千个印度人来到拉合尔看印、巴间的板球比赛。拉合尔的居民除自己尽了大力招待印度人外，并要求政府放宽入境的限制，免去旅客报户口的手续。我也看到虔诚的巴基斯坦回教徒和来巴游览的印度锡克族人（信锡克教）亲切地互问生活情况。由此我相信印、巴人民间自然的友谊，决不是人为的纠纷和美国组织军事集团的活动所能离间、摧毁的。
    在我们和缅甸、日本、埃及科学家之间，以及他们相互之间，存在着友好的关系。日本军国主义的侵略曾经给中国、缅甸的人民以莫大的祸害，但是在印度科学年会上，当中、缅科学家主动地向日本科学家表示友好时，日本科学家也就不感到拘束，并同意各国科学家之间应争取相互访问。埃及科学家且希望得到我们具有高度抗锈性能的“碧玛一号”小麦品种做研究。
    亚非各国人民普遍经历过帝国主义的殖民地、半殖民地的统治，受尽了帝国主义压迫的苦难，因此都十分珍视独立自主，都有高度的自尊心。爱好和平的印度人民是这样，长期向英国殖民主义者进行斗争的埃及人民是这样，就是在和美帝国主义订有军事条约的巴基斯坦，人民也是这样。在巴基斯坦科学年会上，有一自称是农业专家的美国人傲慢地教训巴基斯坦人，说巴基斯坦不宜过速地用机器种地，以避免发生农村失业问题。他的狂妄的论调引起了听众和报纸读者的不满。更狂妄的是另一美国“专家”。当巴基斯坦科学家讨论某地区的灌溉问题，并论述到多种水——河水，雨水，地下水的利用时，他竟斥责他们，说水只有一种。听众中当即有人报以嘘声，并讥笑地问，“一种水”是否就是指氢二氧一？巴基斯坦人告诉我，美国人在巴基斯坦都成了老爷，在巴基斯坦人民中引起了反感。
    亚非各国人民对种族主义，即优良种族论，更特别不能容忍。印度人民痛恨南非联邦对南非印度居民的歧视。巴基斯坦人民也有着同样的痛恨。有一个在东非经商的资本家的眷属告诉我说，她虽然是“上层社会”的人，虽然喜欢旅行，也到过非洲许多地方，但她决不去南非。南非政府歧视有色人种的政策固然是罪恶的，但是泛滥着三K主义的美国才是种族主义的大本营。在印度科学家的年会上，一个据说是很有名的名叫保林的美国生物化学家竟公开地说：“美国人的血球中的血蛋白分子分两极，可以极化，是‘非均一体’，是‘正常’的，对疾病的抵抗力很强；印第安人和黑人的血球的血蛋白分子不分两极，是‘均一体’，是‘不正常’的，对疾病的抵抗力很弱，因之印第安人和黑人死亡率大，寿命短。”这真是比纳粹种族主义更高一等的“科学”！真正的科学绝对与之相反。索克将军反驳他说：“我在八九年前早就研究过血蛋白分子问题，我研究的结果证明我们印度人和美国人，虽然住在不同的地区，吃不同的饭食，可是印度人血球中的蛋白分子和美国人血球中的蛋白分子确确实实是完全相同，毫无区别。”
    进行经济建设也是我在南亚各国所看得到的共同特征。当然，在不同的社会条件和实际情况下，经济建设的方向和速度是有所不同，但无论在印度、巴基斯坦或锡兰，经济建设是在进行中。印度的农业生产已有所增加，电力、灌溉事业也有发展。苏联援助建立的钢厂和印度自己扩建的钢厂将使印度钢铁产量大为增加。巴基斯坦人民极其关心水利建设和可耕土地的增加，以便增加粮食的生产。纺织工厂也在开始建立。巴基斯坦本缺乏可以炼成焦煤的原煤矿，科学家正在试图用去掉硫质的办法使坏煤能应用于工业。科学家这种辛勤的劳动正博得了人们的敬佩。正因为巴基斯坦工业还少，所以巴基斯坦人民对工业建设的要求特别的迫切。在锡兰，我听说投入经济建设的资金也有相当的增加，主要是为了扩大农业生产和发展对外贸易，也为了适当地增建一些轻工业。拿今天的科伦坡和十多年前的科伦坡相比，也的确可以看出在市区、郊区都有了进步，看出锡兰人民是在进行建设工作。
    已经取得了或者正在争取独立的、并进行经济建设的人民，必然爱好和平。印度人民、锡兰人民以及我所遇到的缅甸、印度尼西亚、日本、埃及的科学家，一致要求缓和国际紧张局势，维护亚非和世界的和平；巴基斯坦的人民也有同样的要求。现在美帝国主义正在企图以“帮助”巴基斯坦建立原子研究机构、开展原子能研究为借口，来搜括巴基斯坦境内可能蕴藏的放射性元素的矿产。但巴基斯坦人民和科学界只希望发展原子能来供给巴基斯坦目前还缺少的动力。他们和印度人民一样反对原子武器。
    在南亚各国的访问和对这些国家的人民和亚非不少国家的科学家的接触，更加强了我的信念，即亚非国家的人民对于不同社会制度、不同政治制度的国家的和平共处，具有强烈无比的要求，因为只有和平共处，才能增进各国间的友好合作，发展文化上、经济上的互助，为提高人民的生活而进行建设。尽管美帝国主义不会停止制造各国间的纠纷，挑拨各国间的关系，借“援助”的幌子进行对内政的干涉，在亚非国家中组织侵略集团，并通过这一些罪恶活动来加剧国际紧张局势，为它的战争政策服务，但亚非国家人民保卫和平的意志是坚决的，声音是响亮的。在亚洲国家会议和亚非会议上，他们将为发扬和平共处的五项原则，促进各国间的友好合作，巩固亚洲和世界和平而奋斗。
