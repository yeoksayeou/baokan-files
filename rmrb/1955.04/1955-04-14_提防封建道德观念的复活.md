    Guard Against the Revival of Feudal Moral Concepts
    Cui Jing
    The content of communist moral education is rich and multifaceted; we cannot limit it to issues of male-female relationships, and especially not regard normal interactions between men and women as immoral behavior.

    However, some units have become fixated on the issue of so-called male-female relationships in their moral education work for young people. There are also units that label a young person who has been in love a few times as “promiscuous.” There is also one institution that, after analyzing the lives of over four hundred young people, claimed that 15.1 percent of them were corrupt and degenerate. In reality, many of their so-called corrupt and degenerate behaviors were nothing more than reading martial arts and fantasy novels, or dating. This is clearly a bias.

    We should educate young people to treat the issue of male-female relationships seriously, to see marriage and love as closely related to social interests, and not as some "purely personal matter." Especially considering the current complex social situation, where hooligans, indecent entertainment venues, and book stalls openly and secretly renting and selling pornographic books, as well as the decadent lifestyles of the bourgeoisie, are still poisoning a considerable number of young people, damaging their physical and mental health, this education is even more urgent. It should be said that this is an important part of communist moral education; it is an inseparable part of communist moral education, along with education on labor viewpoints, collectivism, and cherishing public property.

    We cannot view male-female relationships with the prejudices of feudal society. In feudal society, there was the so-called moral standard of "men and women should not touch hands when giving or receiving," meaning that men and women should not exchange items directly, otherwise, it would be considered a violation of "etiquette." Today, there are no more people advocating this moral standard, but its influence has not disappeared. According to some people's thinking, it seems that so-called moral issues are only about male-female relationships. Originally, there is nothing improper about young men and women walking and chatting together, but it is seen as "promiscuity"! Young men and women dancing together is also considered "corruption and degeneration"! What will be the result of this? The result can only be what one young person said: "I don't want to talk to female comrades anymore." Even if some young people don't say this, under these circumstances, they cannot help but feel apprehensive, fearing that they will be labeled with an unclean title. If this is really the case, then it means that some of our comrades are using feudal moral concepts to restrain young people.

    We cannot fail to note that on issues such as marriage and love, there are both bourgeois ideas and feudal ideas. We oppose both. If we use feudal ideas to oppose bourgeois ideas, that is allowing feudal moral concepts to revive; the result will be the same as those who use bourgeois ideas to oppose feudal ideas, and it will not have any other result than creating some confusion in the minds of young people.

    提防封建道德观念的复活
    崔景
    共产主义道德教育的内容，是丰富的，多方面的；我们不能把它局限在男女关系问题上，尤其不能把男女之间的正常交往，都看成是不道德的行为。
    然而，有的单位对青年人的道德教育工作，却钻了牛角尖，老是在所谓男女关系问题上纠缠。也有这样的单位，因为一个青年谈过几次恋爱，就说他是“乱搞男女关系”。还有这样一个机关，他们在分析了四百多个青年的生活状况以后说，有百分之十五点一的人腐化堕落了。而其实，那里面许多人的所谓腐化堕落行为，只不过是看武侠神怪小说，或是谈恋爱罢了。这显然是一种偏向。
    我们应当教育青年严肃地对待男女关系问题，让他们把婚姻和爱情看成是同社会利益密切有关的事情，而不是什么“纯粹的个人私事”。特别考虑到我们目前的社会情况十分复杂，流氓，下流娱乐场所，明里暗里租售黄色书刊的书摊，资产阶级腐朽的生活方式，还在毒害着相当数量的青年人，损害他们的身心健康，这种教育更是迫切的了。应当说，这是共产主义道德教育的一个重要内容；这和劳动观点的教育，集体主义教育，爱护公共财物的教育，都是共产主义道德教育的不可分离的部分。
    我们不能用封建社会的偏见来看待男女关系。在封建社会里，有“男女授受不亲”的所谓道德标准，就是说，男女之间，不能亲授、亲受，否则，就算是越“礼”。而今，提倡这种道德标准的人是没有了，但它的影响并没有消失。照某些人的想法，好像所谓道德问题，也就是男女关系问题。本来，青年男女一道走走，说说笑笑，并没有什么不正当的，却被看作“乱搞男女关系”！青年男女在一起跳跳舞，也算是“腐化堕落”！这究竟会有什么结果呢？结果只能像一位青年所说的：“以后再不要跟女同志说话了。”有些青年纵然不这样说，在这种情势下面，也不能不有些提心吊胆，生怕戴上一顶不干不净的帽子。如果真的这样，那就是说，我们有些同志用封建的道德观念束缚了青年。
    我们不能不注意到，在婚姻和爱情这样的问题上，既有资产阶级思想，也有封建思想。这都是我们所反对的。如果用封建思想去反对资产阶级思想，那就是让封建道德观念复活；其结果将和那些用资产阶级思想去反对封建思想一样，除了给青年人的头脑制造一些混乱以外，不可能有别的结果。
