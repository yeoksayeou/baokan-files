Why Is Construction Preparation Work Not Being Valued Again?
Chen Shengze

The construction project of the Shijiazhuang Thermal Power Plant officially started on April 1st. Although the construction unit had more than eight months of construction preparation time from accepting the task on July 13th of last year to the start of construction, and some preparation work was done, only one of the planned 33 temporary auxiliary projects, the water pool, started on schedule. Other projects were generally delayed by about a month from the plan. For example, the cement mixing plant, which was originally scheduled to start on March 1st and be completed on March 20th, did not have its design submitted until March 20th. Again, for example, the cement warehouse, which was originally scheduled to be completed on February 16th, did not start construction until March 8th, and construction was halted soon after due to lack of materials. Furthermore, construction has started, but the temporary power supply project is not in place.

In mid-March, the leading cadres of the construction site realized the seriousness of the problem and hurriedly sent people to find materials everywhere. Without water pipes, they had to dismantle the temporary steam supply pipelines at the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant. Even after the materials were found, they could not get the railway bureau to allocate wagons because they had not submitted a transportation plan in advance, so the water pipes could not be transported to the construction site on time. Before April, there was no electricity for repairing machinery. In early April, there were no electric lights for mechanical operations day and night at the main factory construction site, so they had to use gas lamps. In early April, there was no water for construction, so they had to carry water manually. There was no office at the construction site, so they had to put up tents first. Although nearly fifty kinds of work systems were drafted at the construction site, they were not well implemented. This made it impossible for the construction site to be constructed according to plan, and the leading cadres of the construction site were thrown into chaos.

It would be wrong to say that there was not enough construction preparation time on this construction site. In fact, there was enough preparation time from the acceptance of the task to the start of construction, and the domestic translation of the technical design arrived on October 13th of last year, so there was a basis for preparation. So, what were the cadres responsible for the construction task doing? Look: after accepting the task, they did not establish a special construction preparation organization, but only let Chen Luoshan, the only engineer of the civil engineering team that was carrying out the construction of the permanent dormitory project of the power station in Shijiazhuang, concurrently handle the construction preparation plan; they insisted on dividing the unified preparation plan into two parts, the civil engineering part was decided by the Shijiazhuang Engineering Team, and the installation issues were the responsibility of the Engineering Company in Taiyuan, so that the construction preparation plan "bounced back and forth" between 231 kilometers, and the final draft was not finalized until mid-December, and the overall construction layout plan alone was reworked three times. In early February, the Engineering Company decided to establish an engineering team and began construction preparation work. In mid-February, the director of the engineering office arrived in Shijiazhuang late, at which time, as the director of the engineering office said, "the situation was already set," and it was too late to start preparing.

Perhaps some people think that this chaos is due to the construction unit's lack of experience? Absolutely not. The unit undertaking this task is the Eighth Fire Power Engineering Company of the Basic Construction Bureau of the General Administration of Power Industry, which was responsible for the construction of the "360" project last year. The "360" project was one of the construction sites with the most serious waste and chaos in basic construction last year. For this reason, the People's Daily specifically published an editorial in August last year, which emphasized that the fundamental reason for the waste and chaos in the construction of the "360" project was the lack of sufficient preparation before construction. The Ministry of Fuel Industry also made a summary at this construction site, and the first lesson learned was also that "construction preparation work is very important." But the leading cadres of this company did not accept this lesson! Why do they always do this? Please ask the person in charge of this company to check and answer this question!

### 为什么又不重视施工准备工作呢

    为什么又不重视施工准备工作呢
    陈圣泽
    石家庄热电厂的建设工程已于四月一日正式开始施工。施工单位从去年七月十三日接受任务起到开工止，虽然施工准备工作时间有八个多月，也做了一些准备工作，而原计划开工的三十三项临时附属工程只有水池一项按时开工，其他工程一般都较计划拖后一个月左右。如原计划三月一日开工、三月二十日完工的水泥搅拌厂，直到三月二十日才提出设计。又如，原计划二月十六日竣工的水泥仓库，直到三月八日才动工，开工不久即停工待料。再如，开工了，而临时供电工程也没有着落。
    三月中旬，工地的领导干部才发觉问题严重，急忙派人设法四出找材料。没有水管，只好到太原电热厂拆临时供汽管道。材料找到了，因为事先没有向铁路局提出运输计划，要不到车皮，还是不能把水管子按时运到工地。四月份前，检修机械时没有电用。四月上旬主要厂房工地昼夜机械作业时没有电灯，只好点汽灯。四月上旬，施工时没有水用，只好用人工挑水。工地没有办公室，只好先支帐篷。现场没有警卫人员，任何人都可以随便出入。工地里虽然起草了近五十种工作制度，却没有很好执行。这就使得这个工地无法按计划施工，工地领导干部被弄得手忙脚乱。
    说这个工地上没有充分的施工准备时间是不对的，事实上，从接受任务到开工有足够的准备时间，而且技术设计的国内译本在去年十月十三日就到了，完全可以有依据进行准备。那末，担负施工任务的干部们干什么去了呢？看吧：他们接受任务以后，没有成立专门的施工准备工作组织，只是让在石家庄正进行电站永久宿舍工程施工的土建工程队唯一的工程师陈洛山兼搞施工准备计划；他们硬把统一的准备计划分成两摊，土建部分由石家庄工程队决定，安装问题由在太原的工程公司负责，使施工准备计划在二百三十一公里之间“来回碰”，碰到十二月中旬还没有定稿，仅施工总平面布置图就返工三次。二月上旬，工程公司才决定成立工程队，着手进行施工准备工作。二月中旬，工程处主任才姗姗地来到石家庄，这时候，正像工程处主任所说的“大势已定”，再着手准备已经来不及了。
    也许有人以为造成这种忙乱现象是由于施工单位没有经验吧？绝对不是。担任这项任务的就是去年负责“三六○”工程施工的电业总局基本建设局火电第八工程公司。“三六○”工程是去年基本建设施工中浪费和混乱现象最严重的一个工地。为此，人民日报在去年八月曾经专门发表社论，社论着重指出“三六○”工程施工中浪费和混乱的根本原因是施工前缺乏充分的准备。燃料工业部也在这个工地作过总结，总结出来第一条经验教训同样是“施工准备工作是十分重要的”。而这个公司的领导干部却没有接受这个教训！为什么他们老是这样做呢？这个问题请这个公司的负责人检查答复吧！
