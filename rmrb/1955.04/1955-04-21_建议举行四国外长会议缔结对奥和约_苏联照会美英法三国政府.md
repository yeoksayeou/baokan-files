    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 20th: TASS reported from Moscow on April 19th that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov received U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Bohlen, on the 19th and informed him of the results of the Soviet-Austrian talks held in Moscow from April 12th to 15th.
    Molotov also handed Ambassador Bohlen a note from the Soviet government to the U.S. government. The note began by stating that "the exchange of views in Moscow between the Soviet government and the delegation of the Republic of Austria, headed by Austrian Federal Chancellor Julius Raab, has shown that it is now possible to finally resolve the Austrian question and conclude the Austrian State Treaty. This would allow Austria to be fully restored as an independent democratic state, which is a great contribution to consolidating the cause of peace in Europe." The note continued:
    "The Soviet government hopes that the U.S. government will do its part to jointly promote the necessary agreement between the governments of the Four Powers and the Austrian government on the issue of concluding the Austrian State Treaty."
    The note further stated: "The Soviet government believes that it is appropriate for the foreign ministers of the United States, France, Britain, and the Soviet Union to hold a meeting in the near future, with the participation of Austrian representatives, to discuss the conclusion and signing of a treaty on the restoration of an independent and democratic Austria."
    The note suggested Vienna as the venue for the aforementioned meeting and expressed the hope that the U.S. government would respond promptly to this proposal.
    Ambassador Bohlen stated that he would immediately forward the information he received from the Soviet government regarding the results of the Soviet-Austrian talks, as well as the Soviet government's aforementioned note, to his government.
    On the same day, Molotov received the chargé d'affaires ad interim of the British Embassy in the Soviet Union, Mr. S.K. Parrot, and the chargé d'affaires ad interim of the French Embassy in the Soviet Union, Mr. Jean Leroy, informed them of the results of the Soviet-Austrian Moscow talks, and handed them notes from the Soviet government to the British and French governments, identical in content to the aforementioned note.

    建议举行四国外长会议缔结对奥和约
    苏联照会美英法三国政府
    新华社二十日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：苏联外交部长莫洛托夫十九日接见了美国驻苏联大使波伦先生，将四月十二日至十五日在莫斯科举行的苏奥会谈的结果通知他。
    莫洛托夫并将苏联政府致美国政府的一件照会交给波伦大使。这个照会首先说：苏联政府同以奥地利联邦总理尤·拉布先生为首的奥地利共和国政府代表团在莫斯科“交换意见的结果表明，现在有可能来最后解决奥地利问题和缔结对奥和约。这样就可以使奥地利完全恢复为独立的民主国家，这是对巩固欧洲和平事业的一大贡献。”照会接着说：
  “苏联政府希望美国政府能尽它那方面的力量，以共同促使四大国政府同奥地利政府就缔结对奥和约问题达成必要的协议。”
    照会又说：“苏联政府认为：美国、法国、英国和苏联四国外长在最近期间在奥地利代表的参加之下举行会议，以讨论缔结关于重建独立民主的奥地利的和约以及在这一和约上签字的问题是合宜的。”
    照会中建议以维也纳作为召开上述会议的地点，并且希望美国政府迅速答复这项建议。
    波伦大使声明，他将把苏联政府通知他的关于苏奥会谈结果的情况以及苏联政府的上述照会立即转达他的政府。
    同日，莫洛托夫接见了英国驻苏联大使馆公使衔临时代办斯·克·帕罗特先生以及法国驻苏联大使馆临时代办让·勒罗瓦先生，将苏奥莫斯科会谈的结果通知了他们，并把苏联政府致英、法政府的相同于上述内容的照会分别交给他们。
