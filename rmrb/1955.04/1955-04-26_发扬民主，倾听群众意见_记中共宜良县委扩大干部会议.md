    Promoting Democracy, Listening to the Opinions of the Masses
    ——A Record of the Expanded Cadre Meeting of the Yiliang County Committee of the CPC
    Bian Zai
    Promoting democracy, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism, can bring into play the initiative and enthusiasm of party members and the masses, can promptly improve shortcomings in work and raise the level of work, and can also enable leading organs and leaders to regularly understand the situation at the lower levels and be subjected to mass supervision. This is a normal phenomenon that must exist in Party life and a characteristic that all Party meetings should have. The Yiliang County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Yunnan Province basically achieved this in the expanded cadre meeting held at the end of February and the beginning of March. Therefore, this meeting was relatively successful, and it timely discovered and corrected shortcomings and errors in its work, ensuring the correct implementation of the Party's policies.

    To hold such a meeting well, the county committee must first have a work report filled with the spirit of self-criticism. Unfortunately, the report prepared by the Yiliang County Committee for the meeting was drafted according to old experience. This report seemed comprehensive on the surface, but it was actually very empty. Although the county committee also felt that such a report could not solve the problem, it did not understand the actual situation, could not raise questions, and could not write a better report. In the end, it had to decide on the important meaning of the report and let the person making the report supplement it with specific materials.

    At the beginning of the meeting, the Yiliang County Committee reviewed its bureaucratic work style of not understanding the situation below and not caring about the lives of the masses in its report. However, when the cadres attending the meeting discussed the report, they simply applauded as usual. Everyone said, "The county committee's report is correct, and the work achievements are fundamental," based on the achievements summarized by the county committee and the problems identified. But were there really no problems in actual work? Did party members and cadres inside and outside the party really have no opinions about the leadership? The facts were not so. This was mainly because many leading cadres only liked to hear praise and did not like to hear criticism; they only wanted to hear about achievements in their work and did not want to hear about shortcomings and problems in their work. They even attacked and reprimanded those who dared to expose the true situation, so many party members did not dare to tell the truth. This situation attracted the attention of the Yiliang County Committee. They went deep among the cadres to understand everyone's ideological situation. After understanding, many township branch secretaries were indeed afraid of being criticized and punished after exposing the true situation, so they only said good things. At this time, the county committee made it clear to the party members and cadres attending the meeting that the leading comrades should bear the main responsibility for the shortcomings and errors in their work; and explained that the county committee's self-examination in the report was still insufficient, and asked everyone to present the situation and help the county committee further examine itself in order to improve leadership and improve work. The county committee repeatedly explained the principle of "say all you know and say it without reservation," "the speaker is not guilty, and the listener should take heed." At the same time, the county committee also mobilized leading cadres in county-level organs and district cadres, clarified the importance of opposing the suppression of democracy and opposing the attack on criticism, and emphasized that a warm welcome and firm protection must be adopted towards the opinions raised by cadres. Under such circumstances, many township branch secretaries began to bravely expose the serious bureaucratic, coercive, and detached work styles of certain county and district cadres. For example, Cao Tianyou, secretary of the Longhua Township Branch, exposed the bad work style of Zhang Jiaqing, a member of the district committee, and Chang Zhenhe, the armed assistant, who arbitrarily arranged work without going through the township branch, "engaged in struggle," forced party members to pretend to be typical examples, falsely reported yields, and deceived the masses during the purchase of grain, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. On the basis of group discussions, the county committee organized typical speeches at the conference to further encourage everyone to boldly expose the true situation and put forward opinions. At this time, the vast majority of township cadres expressed their opinions, and many of the situations and opinions reflected were not known to the county committee in the past or were originally considered to be good. The criticisms they raised to the county committee can be summarized as: it cannot arrange work according to the specific situation of the township, and it cannot go step by step to guide the actual movement; in guiding the work, it emphasizes completing the task and ignores the implementation of policies. The opinions raised to the district cadres mainly concerned work style. The seriousness of the coercive and commanding work style of some district cadres was far beyond what the county committee had imagined. The experience of the Yiliang County Committee fully proves that: the central link in promoting inner-Party democracy lies in enlightening party members and cadres to earnestly unfold criticism and self-criticism. At present, what is more important is self-criticism on the part of leadership and the criticism of party members and the masses. The Yiliang County Committee's specific practices of adopting leadership reviews, calling on leading cadres to support mass criticism, and mobilizing party members and the masses to boldly present the situation and put forward opinions are concrete ways to promote democracy.

    After gaining this experience, the Yiliang County Committee, when studying the remaining problems in grain work and the issue of production mutual aid and cooperation, asked to discuss these issues in the same spirit. When discussing the remaining problems in grain work, many cadres reported that many farmers said they lacked grain. Some of the township cadres attending the meeting also said they lacked grain. The county committee knew that these situations were not entirely true, but it was always good for everyone to speak up. The county committee mobilized all the cadres attending the meeting to present the situation. During the presentation of the situation, it was found that many cadres could not correctly estimate the advantages and disadvantages of their work, and many people said that "the grain work was messed up." Therefore, the county committee, in response to this situation, enlightened everyone to make an in-depth analysis based on the specific situation of the mutual aid teams, agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups that they lead and are located in, and to study whether those who shouted lack of grain were really short of grain? Why were they short of grain? Why did they have to shout if they were not short of grain? After repeated analysis and research combined with the specific circumstances of each township, everyone saw clearly that among those who shouted for lack of grain, only a few poor peasants sold their rations when the millet was just harvested because they needed money or for other reasons; the rest were either afraid of showing off their wealth and shouted, or they wanted to delay some outstanding debts or wanted to sell less spring crops this spring and shouted, and they believed that the earlier they shouted for lack of grain, the better it would be. There were not many real households short of grain, and 37 percent of the township cadres attending the meeting initially said that they lacked grain, but after accounting, only 5 percent were truly short of grain. In this way, the minds of the cadres were cleared, and the minds of the county committee were also cleared.

    When discussing mutual aid and cooperation and spring plowing production, the county committee continued to implement the spirit of democracy. At the beginning, everyone had some blind complacency, whether talking about mutual aid and cooperation or spring plowing production. They said, "The problem of mutual aid and cooperation is not big," "Several mutual aid teams in our township are actively asking to run a cooperative, and all that's left is land shares." They also said, "The county committee proposed to increase production by 5 percent, and our production increase plan is more than 10 percent. The target is much higher than the county committee's, and it's no problem to complete the production increase task." At this time, the county committee led everyone to continue to go deep into presenting the situation and studying the situation, and the problem became clear. The general situation was that the preparations for spring plowing production were generally worse than in previous years. Many farmers were not active in adding farm tools, and the fact was that they lacked farm tools. There was also less fertilizer than in previous years, and it was estimated that the county was short of 20 percent of the fertilizer according to the plan. In addition, about 5 percent of the county's households were in difficulty, and the preparations for spring plowing had not been done well. These situations showed that to comprehensively complete the task of increasing production was not a "small problem," but a big problem, and an extremely arduous task. Everyone's minds were clear, and they consciously examined their blind complacency, and decided to start production immediately. During the meeting, the county committee's work team also made a thorough investigation in Fulong Township in the Second District. Originally, the township had always believed that eight mutual aid teams were actively asking to run a cooperative, but after inspection, it was learned that only one mutual aid team met the conditions for transferring to a cooperative. In addition, the situations and problems presented by everyone at the meeting made the cadres attending the meeting see the current situation of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, consciously demanded to solve the problems existing in the agricultural cooperatives in production activities, and strengthened the leadership of the mutual aid teams.

    Such a meeting was very educational for the party members and cadres who participated in the meeting, making them realize that to do a good job, they must go deep among the masses and promote democracy to listen to the opinions of the masses. After the township branch secretaries returned, they also adopted various methods to understand the thoughts of the masses and listen to their opinions, and changed their previous work style of not going deep among the masses and not listening to their opinions. In order to consolidate the results of this meeting, the Yiliang County Committee also went deep into each township separately to help each township branch study their work and improve their work.

    发扬民主，倾听群众意见
    ——记中共宜良县委扩大干部会议
    边哉
    发扬民主、开展批评和自我批评、特别是自下而上的批评，可以发挥党员群众的积极性、主动性，可以及时改善工作中的缺点和提高工作水平，也可以使领导机关和领导者经常了解下层情况，受到群众性的监督。这是党内生活必须具备的正常现象，是党的一切会议应该具有的特色。中共云南省宜良县县委，在二月底三月初召开的扩大干部会议基本上做到了这一点。因此，这个会议开得比较成功，及时地发现和纠正了工作中的缺点和错误，保证了党的政策的正确贯彻。
    要开好这样的会议，县委首先要有一个充满着自我批评精神的工作报告。可惜宜良县委所准备的会议的报告，却是按着老经验起草的。这个报告中看起来面面周到，实际上空洞得很。县委虽也感到这样的报告不能解决问题，可是不了解实际情况，提不出问题来，无法写出较好的报告来，最后只好把报告的重要意思决定下来，让做报告的人去补充具体材料。
    会议开始，宜良县委在报告中检讨了不了解下面情况、不关心群众生活的官僚主义作风。但是到会干部讨论这个报告时和往常一样，只是叫好。大家根据县委所总结的成绩和检查出的问题，随着说：“县委的报告是对的，工作成绩是基本的。”但是，是不是实际工作中真是没有问题呢？是不是党内外干部对领导真是没有意见呢？事实并不如此。这主要是因为许多领导干部只喜欢听表扬，不喜欢听批评；只愿意听工作中的成绩，不愿意听工作中的缺点和问题，甚至于打击和斥责那些敢于暴露真实情况的人，因此许多党员不敢说实话。这种情况引起了宜良县委的注意。他们就分别深入到干部中去了解大家的思想情况。经过了解，许多乡支部书记确是怕揭露出真实情况后受批评、受处分，所以只是说好话。这时，县委就向到会党员干部表明，工作中的缺点和错误，领导同志应负主要责任；并说明县委在报告中的自我检查还很不够，要求大家摆情况，帮助县委进一步检查，以便改进领导、改进工作。县委反复说明了“知无不言，言无不尽，”
  “言者无罪，闻者足戒”的道理。同时，县委又在县级机关领导干部和区干部中进行了动员，讲清了反对压制民主和反对打击批评的重要意义，强调了对干部提出的意见必须采取热烈欢迎和坚决保护的态度。在这种情况下，许多乡支部书记开始勇敢地揭发了某些县、区干部严重的官僚主义、强迫命令、脱离群众的工作作风。例如，龙华乡支部书记曹天佑揭发了区委委员张家清和武装助理员常振和在购粮中，不通过乡支部任意布置工作，“搞斗争”，强迫党员假装典型，高报产量，欺骗群众，引起群众不满的恶劣作风。在小组讨论的基础上，县委又组织了大会典型发言，进一步启发大家大胆暴露真实情况，提出意见。这时，绝大部分乡干部发表了意见，所反映的情况和意见有许多是县委过去所不了解或原来认为还是不错的。他们对县委提出的批评总括起来是：不能针对乡的具体情况布置工作，不能步步深入指导实际运动；在指导工作上强调完成任务，忽视贯彻政策。对区干部提出的意见主要是作风问题。某些区干部强迫命令作风的严重程度远非县委所想像的。宜良县委的经验完全证明了：发扬党内民主的中心一环在于启发党员和干部切实展开批评和自我批评。在当前更重要的是领导上的自我批评和党员群众的批评。宜良县委所采取的领导检讨，号召领导干部支持群众批评，动员党员群众大胆摆情况提意见，就是发扬民主的具体作法。
    宜良县委取得这种经验后，在研究粮食工作遗留问题和生产互助合作的问题时，就要求以同样的精神来讨论这些问题。在讨论粮食工作遗留问题时，很多干部反映许多农民说缺粮食。到会的一部分乡干部也说缺粮食。县委知道这些情况不完全真实，但大家能说出来总是好的。县委就动员到会全体干部摆情况。摆情况中发现不少干部不能正确估计工作中的优点和缺点，很多人都说“粮食工作搞糟了”；于是县委就针对这一情况，启发大家再根据自己领导的和所在乡、农业生产合作社和互助组的具体情况来作深入的分析，研究那些叫喊缺粮的人究竟是否真缺粮？为什么缺粮？不缺粮为什么也要叫喊？经过结合各乡具体情况反复分析研究，大家看清楚叫喊缺粮的人中，只有少数贫农在谷子刚收下来时等钱用或其他原因把口粮卖了；其余的人有的是怕露富而叫喊的，有的是想拖些尾欠不缴或想今春少卖些小春作物而叫喊的，他们并认为愈早叫喊缺粮愈好办事。真正的缺粮户并不多，到会的乡干部开始有百分之三十七说缺粮食，经过算账，真正缺粮的只有百分之五。这样，清醒了干部的头脑，也清醒了县委的头脑。
    在讨论互助合作和春耕生产问题时，县委继续贯彻了民主精神。开始，大家无论谈到互助合作或春耕生产，都有些盲目自满情绪。他们说“互助合作问题不大”，“我们乡有几个互助组积极要求办社，就差土地入股了”。他们还说：“县委提出增产百分之五，我们的增产计划是一成几，指标比县委高得多，完成增产任务不成问题。”这时，县委领导大家继续深入摆情况研究情况，问题明确了。总的情况是春耕生产的准备一般都比往年差。很多农民添置农具不积极，而事实是缺农具的。肥料也比往年少，估计全县按计划尚缺百分之二十的肥料。再加上全县约有百分之五的困难户，春耕准备也没搞好。这些情况说明了要全面完成增产任务，不是“问题不大”，而是问题不小，是件极其艰巨的工作。大家头脑清醒了，纷纷自觉地检查了盲目自满情绪，决心马上搞起生产来。在会议期间，县委的工作组还到二区伏龙乡摸了底。本来该乡一直认为有八个互助组积极要求办社，但经过检查，了解到只有一个互助组合乎转社条件。再加上会议中大家摆出来的情况和问题，使到会干部看清了互助合作运动的现状，自觉地要求在生产活动中解决农业社中存在的问题，并加强对互助组的领导。
    这样的会议，对参加会议的党员干部教育很大，使他们认识到要做好工作，必须深入群众和发扬民主倾听群众意见。各乡支部书记回去后，也都采取各种方法来了解群众思想和倾听群众意见，转变了以前不深入群众、不听取群众意见的作风。宜良县委为巩固这次会议成果，也分头深入各乡，帮助各乡支部研究工作，改进工作。
