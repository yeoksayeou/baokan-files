The pursuit of luxury and formalism in construction, leading to extravagant waste, has also occurred in Jixi County, Heilongjiang Province. As soon as you get off the train in this county town of only tens of thousands of people, you will see a red and green "temple-style" building, topped with a large red roof, with granite steps at the entrance, four large pillars inside the main gate, and ancient-style lattice windows and railings on the facade, adorned with carvings and painted in color. Is this magnificent building really a temple? No, the sign at the entrance clearly reads seven large characters: "Jixi County People's Government."

The origin of this very "impressive" building is as follows: Last year, in order to alleviate the shortage of public housing in the city, the Jixi County People's Government, led by County Chief Bi Yong, requested the province three times to build a new building. At that time, the province considered that Jixi was a mining area, and the construction costs could be raised from rental income, so they agreed. However, Bi Yong was a person who paid great attention to "impressiveness." He believed that the county People's Government was the leading organ of the county and should not be too shabby. It must be able to "demonstrate the solemnity of the power organ" and "adapt to the socialist long-term vision." Therefore, he specially invited the design department of the Jixi Mining Bureau to help design it, and finally, this building, which they called "semi-national style, Sino-Western style, airplane type," was produced. Unfortunately, no one understands the meaning of this complex name. The people of Jixi County can only honestly call it the "City God Temple."

Building such a "City God Temple" costs a lot of money. The original 240,000 yuan approved by the province was naturally not enough. Moreover, the County People's Government had added many unplanned projects without authorization, so the money was even more insufficient. As a result, the bill showed that it exceeded the budget by more than 100,000 yuan, but the actual amount was far more than that. Because Bi Yong was a shrewd person and knew how to pick up bargains. For example, when it came to using timber, he could find a way to have the forestry department sell it at cost. This item alone saved more than 30,000 yuan.

But after all, a lot of money was overspent. What to do? The county chief misappropriated more than 15,000 yuan from the civil affairs fund, which was originally intended for providing pensions and relief to needy families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and helping to resettle demobilized soldiers. He also misappropriated more than 88,000 yuan from "self-raised funds," which were originally intended for running schools and other public welfare undertakings.

Now, this "City God Temple"-style building stands conspicuously near the Jixi Railway Station. Who knows why this county chief spent so much money but built a "City God Temple"?

### 鸡西县里的“城隍庙”

    鸡西县里的“城隍庙”
    本报记者　金雨困
    在建筑中追求奢华、追求形式等铺张浪费的行为，在黑龙江省的鸡西县也发生了。刚下火车，在这个仅有数万人的县城里，就会看到一座红颜绿色的“庙宇式”的建筑物，上边盖着红色的大屋顶，大门口铺着花岗石石阶，正门里竖着四根大柱，立面上有古式花格的门窗和栏杆，还点缀着雕刻，涂着彩色油漆。这座金碧辉煌的建筑物果真是庙宇吗？不是的，大门口的牌子上分明写着七个大字：“鸡西县人民政府”。
    这座“气派”很大的建筑物的来由是这样的：去年，鸡西县人民政府为了调剂城市公房的不足，县长毕勇三次向省里请求新建楼房一座，当时省里考虑鸡西是一个矿区，而且建筑费用又可从房租收入中自行筹集，因此就同意了。可是毕勇是个十分注意“气派”的人，他认为县人民政府乃是一县的首脑机关，决不能过于寒酸，必须要能“表现政权部门的庄严”和“适应社会主义远景”才行。因此，他专请鸡西矿务局的设计部门帮助设计，最后产生了这个他们叫做“半民族式、中西式、飞机型”的建筑。可惜任何人也不懂得这个复杂名称的含意，鸡西县的人民只能老老实实地称它为“城隍庙”。
    盖这样一座“城隍庙”要花很多钱，原来省里批准的二十四万元自然不够花，况且县人民政府又擅自增加了很多计划外的工程，钱就更加不够花了，结果算算账超支了十万多元，而实际上还远不止此数。因为，毕勇是个精明人，很会捡便宜，譬如用木材吧，他可以想办法要林业部门按成本卖，仅这一项就便宜了三万多元。
    但毕竟还是超支了很多的钱，怎么办呢？县长挪用民政事业费一万五千多元，这些钱本来是应该用在抚恤救济困难的烈、军属，和帮助安置转业军人的；又挪用“自筹经费”八万八千多元，这些钱本来是专用在办学校等群众福利事业上的。
    现在这座“城隍庙”式的建筑物触目地竖立在鸡西车站的附近，谁知道这位县长为什么花了这么多钱，却盖了一座“城隍庙”呢？
