Xinhua News Agency, London, March 30th (TASS): Reuters reports that British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons on the 30th that Britain has decided to join the Turkish-Iraqi Pact. Therefore, the relationship between Britain and Iraq in the future will "conform to the existing relationship between Britain and Turkey and other allies of the North Atlantic Alliance."

Eden said that Britain's participation in this treaty is stipulated by a special British-Iraqi agreement, which was provisionally signed in Baghdad on the 30th and will take effect on April 5th. At the same time, the Anglo-Iraqi Alliance Treaty signed in 1930 was abolished.

It can be seen from Eden's speech that the new agreement essentially replaces the 1930 treaty, which the Iraqi people resolutely advocated for unconditional abolition. The new agreement consolidates the British air force bases in Habbaniya and Shaiba, as well as other privileges enjoyed by Britain under previous unequal treaties. This essentially means maintaining complete British control over the Iraqi army.

Under these circumstances, the abolition of the 1930 treaty will not change the situation in Iraq in the slightest. The purpose of abolishing this treaty is clearly to defend the new enslaving agreement signed by the Nuri al-Said government with Britain in the face of Iraqi public opinion.

Eden said that Britain's participation in the Turkish-Iraqi Pact is aimed at laying the foundation for organizing "Middle East defense," in other words, to establish a Middle East aggressive bloc directly subordinate to the North Atlantic Alliance.

### 艾登宣布英国决定参加土伊条约  企图保持英国对伊拉克军队的完全控制

    艾登宣布英国决定参加土伊条约
    企图保持英国对伊拉克军队的完全控制
    据新华社讯　塔斯社伦敦三十日讯：据路透社报道，英国外交大臣艾登三十日在下院说，英国已经决定参加土耳其—伊拉克条约，因此，今后英国和伊拉克的关系“符合于英国同土耳其和北大西洋联盟其他盟国之间的现有关系”。
    艾登说，英国参加这一条约由专门的英伊协定加以规定，这个协定三十日在巴格达临时签署，将在四月五日开始生效。同时废除了一九三零年签订的英伊同盟条约。
    从艾登的发言中可以看出，新的协定实质上是代替了伊拉克人民坚决主张无条件地废除的一九三零年的条约。新的协定巩固了英国在哈巴尼雅和沙伊巴的空军基地以及英国根据以前的不平等条约所享有的其他特权。这实质上意味着保持英国对伊拉克军队的完全控制。
    在这种情况下，废除一九三零年的条约，丝毫也不会改变伊拉克的情况。废除这一条约的目的显然是要在伊拉克的舆论面前，为努里·赛义德政府同英国签订的新的奴役性的协定辩护。
    艾登说，英国参加土耳其—伊拉克条约的目的是为组织“中东防务”打下基础，换句话说，就是为建立直接附属于北大西洋联盟的中东侵略集团打下基础。
