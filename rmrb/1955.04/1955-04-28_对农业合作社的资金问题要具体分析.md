Title: A Concrete Analysis of the Capital Problems of Agricultural Cooperatives

A complex problem is the raising of capital by agricultural production cooperatives. One of the reasons why many agricultural production cooperatives cannot properly solve this problem is that they have not conducted a concrete analysis of it, but have tried to solve it with a simplified method. Some cooperatives blindly mobilize members to invest, regardless of whether production actually needs it, thinking that "the more the better," and count all of the members' large and small agricultural tools, wood, etc. as investments, burdening the cooperatives with many unnecessary debts. Some cooperatives only know to ask members to invest, but have not figured out exactly where the investment will be used. Some cooperatives make general provisions for funds to be divided equally per household or shared according to labor; some cooperatives with very low land compensation also stipulate that they be shared uniformly according to land. Some cooperatives stipulate that poor members should not invest at all, without analyzing the different degrees of poverty. Some cooperatives stipulate that interest should be calculated uniformly on all investments, while others stipulate that no interest should be given at all. Some cooperatives stipulate that only cash is acceptable, while others stipulate that only physical objects are acceptable. These general and uniform regulations are unreasonable and unworkable. These regulations may seem simple, but in reality, they will cause many difficulties and troubles in solving the investment problem. The production needs, capital uses, and capital sources of each agricultural production cooperative are different, and only by treating different situations differently can the capital problem be properly resolved.

Generally speaking, the funds required by agricultural production cooperatives include: first, production funds (including seeds, fodder, farm tool repair costs, sideline business revolving funds, etc.); second, capital construction funds (including the costs of building water conservancy facilities, cattle and horse sheds, etc., and the costs of purchasing draught animals, farm tools, and sideline business tools, etc.); and third, management expenses (including the costs of purchasing account books, stationery, lamp oil, and other office supplies, and bonuses, etc.).

In the first year of establishing a cooperative, production funds should be shared by members according to land (calculated based on the average annual yield) as a "base pad" (cooperatives with very low land compensation can also share it according to a certain proportion of land and labor); the amount should be limited to what most members can afford, and poor members can postpone, pay in installments, or pay less, and the extremely poor can be exempted. This base pad serves as the members' share fund, is recorded under the names of the payers, and is no longer returned to the members individually when distributing income at the end of the year. It does not need to be calculated for interest and can be taken away when withdrawing from the cooperative. If it is still not enough after apportioning the base pad, members can be mobilized to invest again. For investments other than this base pad, they should be returned after the harvest of the year (part of it can be returned after the summer harvest or early rice harvest, and the rest should be paid off after the autumn harvest), and appropriate interest can be given. Among them, seeds and feed can be returned in kind; fertilizer can be converted into cash. The production funds of old cooperatives should be deducted uniformly from the total income after each year's harvest, without having to be distributed to members in the autumn and then asked for again from the members in the spring; the fertilizer accumulated by each member's family can still be purchased or purchased on credit by the cooperative from the members in cash.

Capital construction costs should mainly be paid from the public accumulation fund. In the first year of establishing a cooperative, there is no public accumulation fund yet, so it is best to engage in less capital construction; some necessary capital construction can be launched by mobilizing members to invest. Appropriate interest should be given for this investment.

Management expenses can be borrowed from members in the first year of establishment, with appropriate interest, or borrowed from the cooperative's sideline business income; after the harvest of the year, it will be deducted from the total income and returned separately. Management expenses should be reduced as much as possible, generally not exceeding one percent of the total income; old cooperatives can reserve it for the coming year after each year's harvest, and then settle it after the harvest of the coming year. It is inappropriate for some cooperatives to stipulate that management expenses should be borne by labor.

    对农业合作社的资金问题要具体分析
    杨叶
    农业生产合作社筹集资金，是一个很复杂的问题。许多农业生产合作社不能妥善地解决这个问题，原因之一是没有对这个问题进行具体分析，而企图用一种简单化的办法解决它。有的社不管生产上是不是确实需要，盲目地动员社员投资，认为“越多越好”，把社员的大大小小的农具、木料等等都算作投资，使合作社背上许多不必要的债。有的社只知道要社员投资，却没有弄清楚投资究竟要用在哪些地方。有的社笼统规定资金按户平均分摊，或者按劳动力分担；有的土地报酬很低的社，也规定统一按土地分摊。有的社规定贫苦的社员一律不投资，而不分析贫苦的程度是各有不同的。有的社规定投资一律计算利息，有的社又规定一律不给利息。有的社规定只要现金，有的社又规定只要实物。这些笼统的、划一的规定是不合理的，也是行不通的。这样规定，看起来似乎很简便，实际上却会使投资问题的解决碰到很多困难和麻烦。各个农业生产合作社的生产需要、资金的用途和资金的来源也各不相同，对于资金问题，只有分别不同情况作不同的处理，才能妥善解决。
    一般地说，农业生产合作社所需要的资金有这几种：一是生产资金（包括种籽、饲草饲料、农具修理费、副业周转费等等），一是基本建设资金（包括修建水利设备、牛栏马棚等的费用和购买耕畜、农具、副业工具的费用等等），一是管理费用（包括买账簿、文具、灯油等办公用品的费用和奖励金等等）。
    生产资金在建社的第一年，应当由社员按土地（以常年应产量计算）分摊“底垫”（土地报酬很低的社，也可以按土地、劳力各占一定比例分摊）；数量以多数社员出得起为限，贫苦社员可以缓交、分期交或少交，极贫苦的可以免交。这种底垫，作为社员的股份基金，记在交纳的人的名下，年终分配收入时不再归还社员个人，不必计息，退社时可以带走。分摊底垫以后仍然不够，可以再发动社员投资。对于这种底垫以外的投资，要在当年收获以后归还（可以在夏收或早稻收获后还一部分，到秋季收获后还清），并可以给适当的利息。其中的种籽、饲料，可以归还实物；肥料可以折成现款。老社的生产资金，应在每年收获后从总收入中统一扣除，不必秋天分给社员，到春天再向社员要；社员各家积的肥料，仍然可以由社向社员用现款买或赊购。
    基本建设费用，主要应从公积金中开支。在建社第一年还没有公积金，最好少从事基本建设；一些必需的基本建设，可以发动社员投资。这种投资应当给适当的利息。
    管理费用，在建社第一年可以先向社员借用，给适当的利息，或者在社里的副业收入中借支；当年收获以后，从总收入中扣除，分别归还。管理费用应当力求减少，一般地说不能超过总收入的百分之一；老社可以在每年收获以后为来年预留下来，到来年收获以后再结算。有的社规定管理费用由劳力负担，是不妥当的。
