Improving Hog Raising and Storage Work
　　Yuan Baomin
    With the development of national economic construction and industrial and agricultural production, and the continuous improvement of the living standards of the broad masses of working people, the consumption of pork is constantly increasing; at the same time, in order to earn foreign exchange to support the country's industrial construction, it is also necessary to export some frozen pork. However, hog raising is based on a decentralized and backward small-scale peasant economy, and the speed of production growth is far behind the speed of demand growth.
    The fundamental solution to the problem of hog supply is to continue to develop the production of high-yield feed to increase hog production, and it is also important to improve the work of hog raising and storage in the supply环节 of state-owned commercial departments.
    In the past few years, state-owned commercial departments lacked sufficient technology and experience in the operation and management of live pigs, and a large number of deaths, illness, weight loss, and leanness of live pigs have occurred. As a result, the rate of emergency slaughter of live pigs is very high. However, in some areas, thanks to the active efforts of the feeding and storage personnel, advanced experience and advanced working methods have been created, so that the live pigs raised not only did not lose weight but also gained meat. For example, the Changsha Hog No. 1 Warehouse, led by Pan Rui, a special advanced worker in state-owned commerce in Hunan Province, created the advanced experience of圈存 live pigs gaining an average of fourteen taels of meat per head per day. Therefore, rapidly improving the work of raising and storing live pigs in the operation of state-owned commercial departments, reducing the death, illness, weight loss, and leanness of live pigs in the supply环节, and reducing the emergency slaughter rate, so that live pigs gain weight and grow meat, has great potential for the country to accumulate funds and increase the social supply of meat.
    To improve the work of raising and storing live pigs operated by state-owned commercial departments, we can start from disinfection and isolation, and feeding management:
    For disinfection and isolation, we must first do a good job of pre-inspection of live pigs before they enter the warehouse. At present, 8% to 30% of live pigs in our country die due to illness. Among them, hog cholera has a relatively high mortality rate. However, there is currently no specific medicine for the treatment of hog cholera. According to test results, the use of hog cholera serum is effective in 95% of early-stage hog cholera cases, and less than 50% of mid- and late-stage hog cholera cases, and the current production of hog cholera serum in our country is limited and cannot be used in large quantities. Therefore, in terms of the prevention and control of hog diseases, we must implement the policy of "prevention is more important than treatment."
    The pre-inspection work is generally carried out by veterinarians and feeding and storage personnel with rich experience in raising live pigs, and adopts a working method that combines science and experience to overcome the difficulty of insufficient veterinarians. In terms of operating procedures, the live pigs transferred from other places are generally driven into the "pre-inspection pen" first for a two-hour rest. After the body temperature is normal, they are checked immediately. If these live pigs are agile, proving that they come from a non-epidemic area, they will be given a general observation. If they come from an area with epidemic diseases, a more general sampling of body temperature should be carried out, and a detailed observation should be made. Live pigs with symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting blood, bloody stools, vomiting white foam, convulsions, sores, panting, and lowering their heads and arching their backs should be selected separately. Those with milder conditions should be sent to the "recuperation pen", those with more severe conditions should be sent to the "isolation pen", and those with severe conditions should be treated with emergency slaughter, and then healthy pigs should be put into the warehouse for feeding.
    Secondly, we must do a good job of environmental sanitation inside and outside the pigsty, strictly disinfect, and remove feces in a timely manner to prevent the spread of germs.
    Thirdly, necessary treatment work is also worth noting. Experience in various places has proved that: when swine erysipelas is prevalent, inject concentrated swine erysipelas vaccine; for those suffering from similar swine erysipelas diseases, inject sulfonamide solution; when gastrointestinal diseases are common, mix sulfonamide and sodium bicarbonate, 10 grams each, into the food and feed each live pig to strengthen the stomach; in summer and autumn, appropriate internal administration of weeping willow, light bamboo leaves, plantain and other drugs to relieve heat and promote diuresis can also achieve certain results.
    The basic requirements for feeding management are to ensure that live pigs eat enough, rest well, have fewer diseases, and gain weight. According to the experience of food companies in various places, the implementation of the "four-fixed" management system of "quantitative, fixed-time, fixed-quota, and fixed-personnel" is a better way to do a good job in feeding management and implement the responsibility system.
    The quality of feeding work directly affects the quality of pigs; proper feed matching can increase the appetite of pigs and make them grow meat quickly. Therefore, according to the characteristics of different pig breeds, combined with the local feed supply situation, the amount of feed needed for each live pig per day should be calculated, and a feed "quantitative" management system should be implemented. This can keep the pigs full, and the feed can be mixed evenly, avoiding the phenomenon of being full at one meal and hungry at another.
    "Fixed-time" feeding can maintain a suitable interval between feedings for live pigs, which is convenient for digestion and prevents diseases such as indigestion caused by too many or too few feedings.
    The "fixed-quota" system is based on the seasonal changes in climate and the warehouse area required for圈存 live pigs to get sufficient rest, exercise, and defecation, to determine the quota number for圈存. This ensures that live pigs have sufficient storage area during the feeding period, and will not be squeezed and bitten by each other due to too many pigs being stored, which will prevent them from resting well and affect their weight gain, or waste storage capacity due to too few pigs being stored.
    The implementation of the "fixed-personnel" system in warehouses is an effective way to clarify the division of labor among feeding and storage personnel and implement the responsibility system, that is, according to the quota number of pigs stored in each pig house (or feeding and storage group), calculate the workload of each operation环节 such as cooking, boiling water, night shifts, cleaning and sanitation, driving pigs, and picking pigs to calculate the quota of personnel. The Beijing Food Company's Pork Department manages an average of 100 to 130 live pigs per feeder, which not only achieves a clear division of labor, dedicated positions and responsibilities, and strengthens the responsibility of feeders, but also helps to cultivate professional and technical personnel and improve feeding technology.
    In January this year, the Pork Department of the Beijing Food Company promoted the advanced experience of meat gain and weight gain in the Changsha No. 1 Hog Warehouse of the Hunan Food Company, improved feeding management, implemented strict disinfection and isolation, did a good job in pre-inspection, and implemented a four-fixed system in feeding management, which has achieved remarkable results. In February, statistics showed that a total of 105,688 catties of meat were gained in the live pigs weighed successively, reversing the phenomenon of weight loss and leanness of live pigs in stock last year; at the same time, the mortality rate of live pigs in stock also decreased from 0.79% in January to 0.48% in February. The facts show that as long as state-owned commercial departments can rapidly improve the feeding and storage of live pigs in the supply环节 and implement a scientific management system, it is possible to reduce the mortality rate of live pigs in stock, reduce illness, and increase weight and gain meat.

    改善生猪饲养保管工作
  　袁保民
    随着国家经济建设和工农业生产的发展，广大劳动人民生活水平的不断提高，对猪肉的消费量正在不断地增长；同时为了换取外汇，支持国家的工业建设，又需要出口部分冻猪肉。而猪的饲养由于建立在分散的落后的小农经济基础上，生产增长的速度远远赶不上需要增长的速度。
    解决生猪供应问题的根本办法，是继续发展高产量饲料的生产以增加生猪生产，而改善国营商业部门供应环节上的生猪饲养保管工作也是值得重视的。
    过去数年中，国营商业部门对生猪的经营管理，缺乏足够的技术和经验，曾经发生生猪的大量死亡、病软、掉膘和瘦耗现象。于是，生猪的急宰率很高。但在某些地区，由于饲养保管员的积极努力，创造了先进经验和先进工作法，使饲养的生猪不但没有掉膘并且长了肉，如湖南省国营商业特等先进工作者潘瑞所领导的长沙生猪第一仓库，就创造了圈存生猪平均每天每头长肉增重十四两的先进经验。因此迅速改善国营商业部门在经营中对生猪的饲养保管工作，减少供应环节中生猪的死亡、病软、掉膘、瘦耗，降低急宰率，使生猪增重长肉，对国家积累资金、增加社会肉食供应量的潜力是很大的。
    改善国营商业部门经营生猪饲养保管工作，可从消毒隔离、饲养管理两方面着手：
    消毒隔离，首先必须做好生猪入库前的预检工作。目前我国生猪因病而死亡的占总饲养数的百分之八到百分之三十。其中尤以猪瘟死亡率较高。但对猪瘟的治疗目前还没有特效药，利用猪瘟血清治疗，据试验结果：初期猪瘟有效者达百分之九五；中期后期猪瘟有效者在百分之五十以下，而且目前我国猪瘟血清生产量有限，不可能大量使用。因此对生猪病疫的防治方面，必须贯彻“防重于治”的方针。
    预检工作一般是由兽医和富有饲养生猪经验的饲养保管员负责，采取科学和经验相结合的工作方法，克服兽医不足的困难。在操作程序上一般是把外地调入的生猪，先赶入“预检圈”内，休息二小时。在体温正常后，随即进行检查。如这批生猪行动敏捷，证明来自非疫区，则进行一般观察。如系来自有疫病地区，则应进行较为普遍的抽测体温，和详细观察，分别将拉稀、吐血、拉血、吐白沫、抽风、开疮、喘气、低头拱腰等有病状的生猪挑选出来，病情较轻的送“休养圈”，较重的送“隔离圈”，严重的作急宰处理，然后将健康猪入库饲养。
    其次，必须做好猪圈内外的环境卫生，严格消毒，及时清除粪便，防止病菌蔓延。
    再次，必要的治疗工作也是值得注意的。各地经验证明：如生猪出败病流行时，注射浓度出败菌苗，患类似出败病的，注射磺胺液；肠胃病多时，每头生猪以磺胺、重曹各十公分，混在食内喂服，以使健胃；夏秋季节可酌量内服水杨柳、淡竹叶、车前草等以解热、利尿，也能收到一定的效果。
    饲养管理方面的基本要求是使生猪吃得饱、休息好、疾病少、长肉增重。根据各地食品公司的经验证明，实行“定量、定时、定额、定员”的四定管理制度，是做好饲养保管工作、贯彻责任制的较好办法。
    饲养工作的好坏，直接影响猪的质量；饲料配合得当，可增加猪的食欲，使猪很快长肉。因此，应根据不同猪种特性，结合当地饲料供应情况，计算出每天每头生猪需要的饲料量，实行饲料“定量”管理制度。这样可以保持经常给猪吃饱，调配饲料厚稀均匀，避免饱一顿、饿一顿的现象。
    “定时”喂食，可以保持生猪吃食有合适的间隔时间，便利消化，不致因喂食次数过多或过少而引起生猪消化不良等疾病。
      “定额”制度是根据季节气候冷热的变化，按照圈存生猪能够得到充分的休息、运动、拉屎尿等需要的仓库面积，来确定圈存定额数字。使生猪在饲养期内有足够的仓容面积，不致因存猪太多而彼此挤压咬闹，不能很好休息而影响长肉增重，或因存猪太少而浪费仓容。
    实行仓库“定员”制度是使饲养保管员明确分工贯彻责任制的有效办法，即根据每一猪舍（或饲养保管小组）仓容定额存猪数，计算煮食、烧水、值夜班、清洁卫生、赶猪挑猪等各个操作环节的工作量来核算人员的定额。北京市食品公司猪肉部平均每一饲养人员管理生猪一百至一百三十头，不仅做到明确分工，专职专责，加强了饲养人员的责任心，而且有利于培养专业技术人员，提高饲养技术。
      今年一月份，北京市食品公司猪肉部推广湖南省食品公司长沙第一生猪仓库长肉增重的先进经验，改善饲养管理，实行严格的消毒隔离，做好预检工作，在饲养管理上实行四定制度，已获得显著的成绩。二月份统计先后过磅生猪共长肉增重一十万五千六百八十八斤，扭转了去年库存生猪瘦耗掉膘的现象；同时库存生猪死亡率也由一月份的百分之零点七九降低到二月份的百分之零点四八。事实说明只要国营商业部门能在供应环节中迅速改善生猪饲养保管，实行科学的管理制度，可以做到使库存生猪的死亡率降低、病软减少、并且长肉增重。
