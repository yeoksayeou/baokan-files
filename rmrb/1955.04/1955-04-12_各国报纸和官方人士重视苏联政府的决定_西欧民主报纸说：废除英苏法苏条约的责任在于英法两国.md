Xinhua News Agency, April 11th—The Soviet Council of Ministers' proposal to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR to abolish the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Franco-Soviet Treaty has been met with great attention by newspapers and officials of various countries around the world.

    The French "l'Humanité Dimanche" pointed out that this is the inevitable result of the French government and parliament's approval of the Paris Accords. The newspaper said that it can be considered that after the President of the Republic signed the Paris Accords, France lost the main treaties guaranteeing its security and independence. The newspaper said that the French government deliberately abolished this alliance.

    "La Tribune des Nations" published a conversation with "French authorities" who insisted that the Paris Accords do not contradict the Franco-Soviet Treaty.

    A British Foreign Office spokesman issued a statement on the 9th, referring to the British government's note to the Soviet Union on January 26th, which insisted that the Paris Accords did not conflict with the Anglo-Soviet Treaty.

    Major American newspapers attached great importance to the Soviet government's decision. "The New York Times" and "New York Herald Tribune" both published editorials. The Associated Press correspondent in Washington said that the U.S. State Department's "reaction to the Soviet action was calm." However, news reports from various newspapers prove that the American ruling group is uneasy about the reaction to the Soviet government's decision in Britain and France, because the public in European countries believes that the Anglo-Soviet and Franco-Soviet treaties are a strong guarantee for European security against the threat of German militarism.

    Berlin's democratic newspapers all reported the Soviet Council of Ministers' proposal on the front page on the 10th. "Neues Deutschland" and "National-Zeitung" published commentaries, pointing out that the responsibility for abolishing the treaties lies with Britain and France.

    All newspapers in West Berlin paid close attention to the announcement of the Soviet Council of Ministers. "Berliner Morgenpost" reflected the views of the German aggressor group, and made no secret of its joy at the possible abolition of the Anglo-Soviet and Franco-Soviet treaties. The newspaper insisted that the treaties concluded during the struggle against Hitler's Germany seemed to be a "political blunder of the West."

    The Italian "l'Unità" pointed out that France and Britain have fundamentally changed their position and turned to unite with West Germany against the Soviet Union. In this case, the treaty can no longer be considered valid.

    "Avanti!", "Nazione" and other newspapers all reported the Soviet government's decision prominently.

    The Danish "Land og Folk" commented that the Soviet action pointed out in the most resolute way the great danger brought about by the ratification of the Paris Accords.

    各国报纸和官方人士重视苏联政府的决定
    西欧民主报纸说：废除英苏法苏条约的责任在于英法两国
    据新华社十一日讯　苏联部长会议向苏联最高苏维埃主席团提出的废除英苏条约和法苏条约的建议受到世界各国报纸和官方人士的重视。
    法国“人道报星期日刊”指出这是法国政府和议会赞成巴黎协定的必然结果。报纸说，可以认为：共和国总统在巴黎协定上签字以后，法国就丧失保障它的安全和独立的主要条约了。报纸说，法国政府是蓄意废除这个联盟。
      “星期周报”发表了“法国权威人士”的谈话，这些人硬说巴黎协定同法苏条约并不矛盾。
    英国外交部发言人九日发表声明，提到一月二十六日英国政府致苏联的照会，这个照会硬说巴黎协定同英苏条约没有抵触。
    美国各大报极其重视苏联政府的决定，“纽约时报”和“纽约先驱论坛报”都发表了社论。美联社驻华盛顿记者说，美国国务院“对苏联行动的反应是平静的”。然而，各报消息证明，美国统治集团对英法两国国内对苏联政府的决定的反应感到不安，因为欧洲各国公众认为英苏和法苏条约是使欧洲安全免受德国军国主义威胁的有力保障。
    柏林民主报纸十日都在头版地位报道苏联部长会议的建议，“新德意志报”和“国民日报”发表了评论，指出废除条约的责任在于英国和法国。
    西柏林的所有报纸都十分注意苏联部长会议的公告。“柏林晨邮报”反映了德国侵略集团的看法，毫不掩饰对英苏和法苏条约可能被废除的高兴。报纸硬说在对希特勒德国作斗争期间所缔结的条约似乎是“西方的政治上的失着”。
    意大利的“团结报”指出，法英两国已经根本改变自己的立场，转而联合西德来反对苏联。在这种情况下，条约已经不能再被认为是有效的了。
  “前进报”、“国家报”和其他报纸都以显著地位报道了苏联政府的决定。
    丹麦“国土与人民报”评论说：苏联的行动以最坚决的方式着重指出了批准巴黎协定带来的巨大危险。
