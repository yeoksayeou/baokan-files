Steel industry workers in enterprises affiliated with the Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry put forward more than 30,000 rationalization proposals in 1954. Forty-two percent of these have been adopted, and the calculable value created after being put into production is more than 5.2 million yuan. These implemented suggestions have played a significant role in improving technology, increasing production, improving product quality, reducing costs, improving working conditions, and ensuring production safety. For example, after Tianjin Steel Plant worker Wang Yongfu and others created an automatic steel-turning trough, working conditions were improved and operations were made safer, which can increase profits by 350,000 yuan per year. The steelmaking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant changed the manual carts used to transport open-hearth scrap raw materials to mechanized electric carts, which reduced the heavy physical labor of workers and improved production efficiency. Huang Rongchang of Plant 101 created 27 machines in the carpentry workshop, completely transforming manual operations into mechanical operations, increasing work efficiency by 289 times and saving the country more than 600,000 yuan in wealth. The central laboratory of Fushun Steel Plant collectively created a method for taking tensile test samples with hollow drills, increasing work efficiency by more than four times, thus eliminating the backlog of steel inspection and creating more than 47,000 yuan of wealth for the country throughout the year.

    钢铁工业职工努力发挥创造性
    重工业部钢铁工业管理局所属企业职工，一九五四年共提出三万余件合理化建议，有百分之四十二已被采纳，其中投入生产后能计算的创造价值就有五百二十多万元。这些已经实现的建议，对改进技术、增加生产、提高产品质量、降低成本、改善劳动条件、保障生产安全等方面起了重大作用。如天津钢厂工人王永福等创造自动翻钢槽后，改善了劳动条件，并使操作安全，全年可增加利润三十五万元。太原钢铁厂炼钢部将运送平炉废钢原料的人力推车改为机械化电力推车，使工人减轻了繁重体力劳动，而且提高了生产效率。一○一厂黄荣昌在木工厂创造了二十七部机器，使手工操作完全变为机械操作，提高工作效率二百八十九倍，为国家节约六十多万元的财富。抚顺钢厂中心试验室集体创造了空心钻取抗张试样方法，提高工作效率四倍以上，因而消灭了钢材的检验积压现象，全年为国家创造四万七千余元的财富。
