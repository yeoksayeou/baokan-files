　　"Three-Fix" Sluice Gate

Recently, at a mass meeting of farmers in Zhao Yi Village, Anping Township, Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, it was unanimously agreed to name the newly built sluice gate the "Three-Fix" Sluice Gate.

Why is it called the "Three-Fix" Sluice Gate? There's a story behind it.

Zhao Yi Village faces the forty-li-long Songshan Creek. In the past, every summer and autumn, the creek would often flood, causing disasters, or there would be no water for irrigation during long droughts. It not only directly harmed Zhao Yi Village, but also affected the harvest of two thousand mu of rice fields on both sides of the creek and in the area of the creek's tributaries. Some farmers asked: Since "storing grain can prevent famine," why can't we store water to irrigate the fields? So the farmers decided to build a sluice gate in the middle of the creek (near Zhao Yi Village) to block the water. Later, due to rainy weather and rising creek water, the sluice gate construction could not start. The farmers only built a temporary dam upstream of the sluice gate site to cut off the water flow, making it easier to build the sluice gate foundation. However, the creek water continued to rise. At this time, many farmers in the village believed that there was not much certainty of building the sluice gate before the spring plowing.

After the publicity of the "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" policy for grain, the enthusiasm of the farmers in Zhao Yi Village for production not only increased, but also strengthened their confidence in building the sluice gate. One evening in mid-March, four farmer representatives from the village were returning from the township leadership organs when they linked the topic of "Three-Fix" to the construction of the sluice gate. Li Youquan, the director of the village representatives, said: "If our village's sluice gate is not built well, this year's production increase target will be difficult to achieve." They decided to explain these stakes to the farmers clearly the next day when they returned to the village, and mobilize all the villagers to quickly raise the water barrier dam and pave the sluice gate foundation. After returning to the village, they were always worried about the rising creek water, so they lit pine firewood and patrolled the creek ditch in the dark night. After inspection, the creek water had risen to only two or three inches from the top of the temporary barrier dam. If the barrier dam had not been raised at that time, there would have been a danger of being breached by the creek water, and then the sluice gate foundation would have been impacted. If the foundation was eroded, although it would take more effort to rebuild it, it would be unlikely to be completed before the spring plowing. After discussing it, they immediately took action, some carrying soil, some building the embankment, and they worked until dawn. The next day, they mobilized twelve shock team members to drain the accumulated water from the foundation on one side and rush to pave the foundation on the other, working for three days and four nights, and finally paved the foundation well. By the end of March, the sluice gate had finally been paved with stone slab bridges, and the originally planned half-month project was completed in nine days.

The name "Three-Fix" Sluice Gate was born in this way.

The reporter visited Yingshan Village, which is located downstream of Songshan Creek and is frequently flooded. Village cadres said: With the completion of this sluice gate in Zhao Yi Village, we are more confident in completing our village's production increase plan this year. The whole village has planned to change more than 190 mu of intercropped rice fields to continuous cropping rice and to change single-season rice to double-season rice, which is estimated to increase grain production by 30,000 jin from this item alone. At the same time, the village also plans to use ditches and ponds to raise fish.

### “三定”闸

 　“三定”闸
    新华社记者　王良佑
    最近，在浙江省诸暨县安平乡赵一村的农民群众会上，一致同意将新建成的水闸命名为“三定”闸。
    为什么叫“三定”闸呢？这里面有一段细节。
    赵一村面临着一条四十里长的松山溪，过去每到夏秋之间，常因溪水泛滥成灾，或因久旱无法引水灌溉，它不仅直接危害着赵一村的一个村，而且也影响到溪的两岸和溪的支流范围内二千亩水稻的收成。有的农民问：既然“积谷可以防饥”，为什么不能积水灌田呢？于是农民们决定在溪的中流（赵一村附近）建造一座水闸拦水。后来，因为天气阴雨，溪水上涨，建闸工程不能开工，农民们只在闸址上游打了一个临时拦水坝，切断水流，便于建造水闸地基。但是，溪水依然不断地上涨。这时，村里不少农民认为要在春耕前造好水闸，把握不大。
    经过粮食“定产、定购、定销”政策的宣传，赵一村农民不仅生产积极性提高了，而且建水闸的信心也加强了。三月中旬的一个晚上，村里的四个农民代表从乡领导机关回来的路上，又把“三定”的话题联系到造水闸的事情上来。村代表主任郦友权说：“我们村里这座水闸如果不造好，今年的增产指标就难实现了。”他们决定回村的第二天，就把这些利害关系向农民讲解清楚，发动全村农民赶快加高拦水坝和铺好水闸地基。他们回村后对上涨的溪水总是放心不下，便在黑得对面不见人的夜里，燃起松柴火到溪沟巡看。经过检查，溪水已涨到距离那个临时拦水坝岸顶只二、三寸，假使当时不把拦水坝加以培高，就有被溪水冲破的危险，那末水闸地基就要遭受冲击；如果地基被冲刷，固然还可多花费些力气重新建造，但要在春耕前做好是不大可能。他们商量以后，便马上行动起来，挑土的挑土，培堤的培堤，一直干到天亮。第二天又发动了十二个突击队员，一面抽出地基的积水，一面突击铺好地基，一直工作了三天四夜，终于把地基铺好。到三月底，这座水闸已最后铺上了石板桥梁，原定的半月工程九天就完成了。
    “三定”闸的名字就是这样产生的。
    记者访问了松山溪下流经常受涝的应山村。村里干部说：赵一村造好了这座水闸，今年我们村里完成增产计划更有把握了。全村已计划把一百九十多亩田的间作稻改连作稻和变单季稻为双季稻，估计仅这一项就可以增产粮食三万斤。同时这个村还计划利用沟塘来养鱼。
