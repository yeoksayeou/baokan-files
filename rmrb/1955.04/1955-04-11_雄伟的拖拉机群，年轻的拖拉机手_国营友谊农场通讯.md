Magnificent Tractor Fleet, Young Tractor Drivers
—A Dispatch from the State-Owned Friendship Farm
By Our Correspondent Li Wen

    As soon as the training course ended, the tractor drivers of the State-Owned Friendship Farm rushed from Harbin to Fulitun. The young men spent a day and a night on the train. After getting off, they didn't even bother to eat or rest, and went in groups of three or five to the airfield in the southern suburbs of Fulitun, eager to see the brand-new tractors presented by our Soviet elder brothers. For two consecutive days, they meticulously carried out the operational testing of the tractors, carefully examining every small part of each tractor, and familiarizing themselves with the temper and personality of this partner in future battles.

    At 11:00 a.m. on March 23rd, I accompanied the tractor drivers, driving the last batch of tractors (42 in total), to the site – the Sandaogang grassland. One after another, the tractors in front crossed the small river, crossed the railway, and climbed up the distant hillside, while the tractors at the rear were just driving out of the parking lot. This was a five- or six-li-long line of tractors, what a magnificent line! The roar of the tractor fleet, like thunder in June, continuously shook the earth, overwhelming the sound of the train whistle.

    The tractors drove into Shagang Village. Although it was not the first time that the Friendship Farm's tractors had driven through this village on the edge of the grassland, this tractor fleet still attracted men, women, old, and young from the village to the streets. They stared intently as one tractor passed, and then hurried to look at the second one. People stood by the roadside, people stood at the entrance of the alleys, and some people stood by the windows in the houses, pressing their faces tightly against the glass. Two children, eight or nine years old, followed behind the tractors, running and laughing from the west end of the village to the east end, gesturing with their small hands. I silently blessed this young generation. How happy they are! When their grandfathers and fathers were young, hunger and heavy labor like cattle and horses awaited them. An old farmer in his seventies, seeing a tractor ploughing the land for the first time, exclaimed excitedly, "I have lived to such an old age, and only now do I see humans and livestock separated!" Today, although we still lack a large number of tractors, with the development of industrial construction, producing a large number of tractors is no longer a distant prospect.

    The tractor fleet advanced slowly, and the vast grassland unfolded even more expansively before us. The wind scattered the clouds in the sky, and the sun peeked out from the gaps in the clouds. Looking from afar, the moving tractors looked like deep gray ships sailing on a yellowish-brown ocean, shimmering in the sunlight. I sat next to Chen Ming, the driver of a Stalin-80 tractor. Chen Ming straightened up from time to time, looking back and forth. He seemed to say something to himself and laughed happily. I asked him, "What are you thinking about?" He pointed forward with his hand and then turned his back and pointed backward, leaned close to my ear, and said loudly, "I am happy from the bottom of my heart!"

    I could understand the joyful mood of this young tractor driver. Before the departure, I had visited them. Some of them had personally built the first mechanized farm in New China – the Tongbei Farm – under very difficult conditions; some were pioneers of the Yellow River flooded area farms in Henan, the Dongxin Farm in the Jiangsu reclamation area, or the famous Ninety-Three Farm and Erlongshan Farm on the northern Manchurian grassland. Wherever they went, the wasteland turned into fertile fields; they produced more and more "treasures among treasures" – grain – for the motherland every year. They felt proud and happy about this. Now they have come to support and build this largest grain farm in New China. Some of them are students who have just come from agricultural mechanization schools. They thank the Party and the state for training them to become glorious tractor drivers, and they eagerly look forward to being投入 to the intense work as soon as possible.

    It is precisely this love for their profession and the eagerness to make contributions to the motherland that makes them unafraid of all difficulties and able to overcome all difficulties.

    During the three months of study in the training course, they studied the theoretical knowledge of tractors and advanced Soviet experience – from familiarizing themselves with and mastering the structure of tractors, the repair and maintenance of tractors, agricultural machinery, and machine management, to acquiring certain agricultural knowledge. The time was short, the content was abundant, and the learning was intense. For tractor drivers who had a certain amount of practical operating experience but a low level of education, learning was difficult. Zhang Sheng was such a person. He only knew a few dozen characters, could not take notes, and could not understand the handouts, so he could only rely on his memory. He did not bow his head to difficulties. He listened attentively in class, and with the help of the study group leader after class, he reviewed carefully. If he could not remember something clearly, he would diligently ask others. Every night before going to bed, he would silently review the content he had learned that day in his mind, making sure to understand it and remember it. He finally achieved good academic results: he scored five points in two of the five subjects, and four points in the other three. More than 85 percent of the more than 180 tractor drivers scored five and four points in the graduation exam.

    The tractor drivers will never forget that this academic achievement was obtained under the diligent guidance of Soviet experts. The image of the Soviet experts, the example of the great internationalist spirit, is deeply imprinted in the minds of every tractor driver. The tractor drivers remember how, when explaining the structure of the tractor with real objects, the expert in a brand-new suit did not hesitate to crawl in and out under the tractor's body, instantly getting covered in oil. They remember how, in the cold weather, when they were practicing driving the tractor and came out of the cab covered in sweat, the Soviet expert hurriedly put his coat on them. What they remember most is how the friendly hands of the Soviet experts helped them overcome the difficulties in their studies and helped them make their own hands more skillful...

    The tractor drivers are also moving forward with a love for life and with beautiful ideals.

    Gu Feixiong, he participated in guerrilla warfare, served as a militia captain, and fought a fierce struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries. In the difficult years, he yearned for a better life in the future: driving away the enemy and building a new country; he had fantasized about becoming a tractor driver. Today, the ideal has been realized, and he will use selfless labor to enrich and enrich his ideal.

    The old society brought suffering to Li Ailin and deprived her of the joy of childhood. Japanese soldiers forced her father to dig trenches and tortured her elderly father to death; her brother was "conscripted" and disappeared without a trace; her mother cried and went blind. When she was fourteen years old, she was forced to undertake the heavy labor that an adult could bear to support her elderly mother and young brother. In the new society, this rural girl from the suburbs of Zhengzhou, who had suffered all kinds of hardships six years ago, had served as the leader of an agricultural production mutual aid group, was elected as a labor model, and today she has learned the skills to tame the "iron horse" and become a female tractor driver. She said, "I am happy, I am happy, I will definitely work hard."

    Among the tractor drivers is a happy couple. The man's name is Liu Huan'gao, twenty-two years old; the woman's name is Yang Junhui, nineteen years old. They are both third-year students of the Agricultural Mechanization School affiliated to the Northeast Agricultural College and were transferred together to the Friendship Farm Tractor Driver Training Course to study. In their studies, the two helped each other and encouraged each other, and love grew from deep friendship; love made the two young people more diligent. Yang Junhui's academic performance was average at school, but she obtained all five points in this training course graduation exam; Liu Huan'gao also achieved the same excellent results. On the eve of going to the production post, the two made a happy arrangement for their work and life. They planned to get married in three years and also planned to use their labor achievements as their future wedding gift.

    The tractor fleet continued to move forward. Night was gradually falling, and the whole earth was like a gray sea. Suddenly, dazzling silver flowers bloomed in this gray sea. The tractor drivers turned on their headlights and began their night march. The bright lights made people feel happy. Who could not feel joy and excitement for this magnificent scene of the labor march!

    The roar of the tractor fleet will awaken the sleeping grassland. Through this rhythmic roar, I seemed to hear a voice again: "We know that the eyes of the people of the motherland and the people of the Soviet Union are watching us, and we will never fail the hopes of the people of the motherland and the people of the Soviet Union." This is what tractor driver Li Yingjun said on behalf of all the tractor drivers at the vehicle acceptance meeting before departure, in front of the farm leaders and all comrades, and in front of the Soviet experts. Through the roar of the tractor fleet, I seemed to see the faces of the tractor drivers, each with a happy smile, and their thick and powerful hands. I seemed to hear a voice: We are the vanguards on the production front, and the tasks assigned to us by the motherland must be completed! Give us the most difficult and arduous tasks!

    雄伟的拖拉机群，年轻的拖拉机手
    ——国营友谊农场通讯
    本报记者　力文
    训练班一结束，国营友谊农场的拖拉机手们便从哈尔滨赶到福利屯。小伙子们坐了一天一夜的火车；下了车，连饭也不去吃，休息也不休息，就三五一伙地奔向福利屯南郊的停机场，忙着去看苏联老大哥赠送的崭新的拖拉机。一连两天，他们一毫不苟地进行了拖拉机的运转试验，仔细察验了每台拖拉机的每个细小部分，熟悉了这个未来战斗中的伙伴的脾气和性格。
    三月二十三日上午十一时，我随同驾着最后一批拖拉机（四十二台）的拖拉机手们，向现场——三道岗草原出发了。一台又一台，前面的拖拉机越过小河，越过铁路，已爬向远远的山坡，后尾的拖拉机才驶出停放场。这是一条五六里路长的拖拉机的行列，多么雄伟的行列啊！拖拉机群的轰鸣，像六月的巨雷，连续不断地震荡着大地，压倒了火车汽笛的鸣叫。
    拖拉机驶进了沙岗村。虽然，友谊农场的拖拉机已不是第一次驶过这个草原边缘的村庄，可是这一次的拖拉机群还是把村中的男女老少吸引到街上来了。他们目不转睛地看着一台拖拉机过去了，又急忙去看第二台。道旁站着人，巷口站着人，还有些人站在屋子里的窗口边把脸紧贴在玻璃窗上看。有两个八九岁的小孩，跟在拖拉机后面，从村西头到村东头，一边跑着笑着，一边用小手比划着。我暗自为这年轻一代祝福。他们是多么幸福啊！当他俩的爷爷、爸爸年轻的时候，是饥饿和牛马般的沉重劳动等待着他们。一位七十多岁的老农民第一次看到拖拉机耕地时，兴奋地说：“活了这么大岁数，我才看到人和牲畜分家！”今天，我们虽然还缺乏大量的拖拉机，但是随着工业建设的发展，生产大量拖拉机已不是什么渺茫的事情了。
    拖拉机群缓缓地前进着，大草原更加辽阔地展开在我们的面前。风吹散了天空的阴云，太阳从云隙里露出来。远远望去，行进中的拖拉机，像一只只航行在米黄色海洋上的深灰色的船，在阳光照映下闪闪发光。我坐在斯大林八十号驾驶员陈明的身旁；陈明不时地直起身来，前后了望，他像对自己说了句什么，快活地笑了。我问他：在想什么？他用手向前指一指，又背过脸向后指一指，附在我的耳上，大声地说：“我从心眼里高兴啊！”
    我能够理解这位年轻拖拉机手的欢快心情。在出发前，我曾访问过他们。他们中的一些人曾在十分艰苦的条件下，亲手建成了新中国第一个机械化农场——通北农场；有些人是河南黄泛区农场、江苏垦荒区东辛农场、或者北满草原上著名的九三农场、二龙山农场的开拓者。他们走到那里，那里的荒地变成了良田；他们每年为祖国生产越来越多的“宝中之宝”——粮食。他们为这感到自豪和幸福。现在他们又来支援和建设这个新中国最大的谷物农场了。他们中也有些人是刚从农业机械化学校来的学生，他们感谢党和国家把他们培养成光荣的拖拉机手，他们急切地盼望着早一天投入到紧张的劳动中去。
    正是这种热爱自己的职业，热切地为祖国立功的情感，使他们不怕一切困难，能够战胜一切困难。
    在训练班三个月的学习时间里，他们学习了有关拖拉机的理论知识和先进的苏联经验——从熟悉和掌握拖拉机构造，拖拉机的修理和保养，农业机械，机务管理，到具备一定的农业知识。时间短，内容多，学习是紧张的。对于虽有一定实际操作经验，文化程度却很低的拖拉机手来说，学习是困难的。张生便是这样的一个人。他只识几十个字，不能记笔记，又看不懂讲义，只能靠脑子记忆。他没有向困难低头，在课堂上用心听，课后在学习小组长的帮助下，认真复习，记不清楚的，勤去问别人。每天晚上临睡前，他总是把一天学习的内容，默默地在心里总复习一遍，务必理解它，记住它。他终于取得了良好的学习成绩：在五项课目中有两项考得五分，三项是四分。一百八十多名拖拉机手有百分之八十五以上的人毕业考试成绩是五分和四分。
    拖拉机手们永远不会忘记，这个学习成绩是在苏联专家辛勤教导下取得的。苏联专家的形象，伟大的国际主义精神的榜样，深深地印在每个拖拉机手的脑海里。拖拉机手们记得用实物讲解拖拉机构造的时候，穿着崭新衣服的专家，是怎样毫不犹豫地在拖拉机的机体下面钻进钻出，顿时弄得满身油污了。他们记得，在寒冷的天气里，当他们实习拖拉机驾驶，满头大汗地从驾驶室走出来的时候，苏联专家是怎样急忙把自己的大衣披在他们的身上。他们最难忘的是苏联专家的一双友谊的手，是怎样地帮助他们克服了学习中的困难，帮助他们把自己的手变得更加灵巧……
    拖拉机手们也带着对生活的热爱，带着美妙的理想前进。
    顾飞熊，他参加过游击战，当过民兵大队长，同国民党反动派进行过残酷的斗争。在艰苦的年月里，他向往过未来的美好的生活：赶走敌人，建设新国家；他曾幻想过当一名拖拉机手。今天，理想实现了，他要用忘我的劳动去充实和丰富自己的理想。
    旧社会给李爱林带来苦难，夺去了她童年的欢乐。日本兵强迫她父亲去挖战壕，把她的年老的父亲折磨死了；哥哥被“抓壮丁”了，一去无音信；母亲哭瞎了眼睛。她十四岁的时候，便被迫承担了一个成年人所能够担当的沉重劳动，来维持老母和幼弟的生活。在新社会里，这个六年前的郑州市郊区的受尽苦难的农村少女，当过农业生产互助组组长，被选为劳动模范，今天又学会了驯服“铁马”的本领，成为一名女拖拉机手了。她说：“我幸福，我高兴，我一定好好地工作。”
    在拖拉机手中有一对幸福的情人。男的叫刘焕高，二十二岁；女的叫杨君慧，十九岁。他俩都是东北农学院附设农业机械化学校的三年级学生，一块调到友谊农场拖拉机手训练班学习。在学习中，两个人互相帮助，互相鼓励，从深厚的友谊中产生了爱情；爱情使得两个年轻人变得更加勤奋了。杨君慧在学校时，学习成绩平常，在这次训练班毕业时，获得了全五分的成绩；刘焕高也取得了同样的优秀成绩。在走向生产岗位的前夕，他俩把工作和生活作了个幸福的安排，他们计划在三年后再结婚，还准备用自己的劳动成就，作为未来的婚礼。
    拖拉机群继续前进着。夜色渐渐降临了，整个大地像一个灰茫茫的海。突然，在这个灰色的海中开放了一朵朵光彩夺目的银花。拖拉机手们打开车灯，开始夜行军了。灿烂的灯光惹得人心花开放，谁能不为这劳动进军的壮丽景色，感到喜悦和激动啊！
    拖拉机群的轰鸣将唤醒沉睡的草原。透过这有节奏的轰鸣声，我似乎又一次听到一种声音：“我们知道祖国人民、苏联人民的千万双眼睛在看着我们，我们决不辜负祖国人民和苏联人民的希望。”这是拖拉机手李英俊在出发前的受车大会上，代表全体拖拉机手，在农场领导同志和全体同志面前，在苏联专家面前所说的话。透过拖拉机群的轰鸣，我似乎看到拖拉机手们的一个个挂着幸福的微笑的脸，和粗壮有力的双手。我似乎听到一种声音：我们是生产战线上的尖兵，祖国交给我们的任务一定要完成！把最艰巨的最繁重的任务交给我们吧！（附图片）
