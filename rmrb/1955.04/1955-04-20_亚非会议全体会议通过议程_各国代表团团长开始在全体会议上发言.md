Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, April 19th: The Asian-African Conference plenary session continued at 4:20 PM on the 18th. Before the resumption, the heads of delegations held a meeting. Conference Chairman, Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo, announced at the plenary session the agenda agreed upon at the meeting of heads of delegations. The agreed agenda was: 1. Economic cooperation, 2. Cultural cooperation, 3. Human rights and self-determination, 4. Dependent territories, 5. Promotion of world peace and cooperation. The issues of Palestine, Tunisia, and Morocco will also be discussed. The plenary session adopted this agenda.

The Conference Chairman announced that the conference would proceed in the form of plenary sessions, closed sessions, and meetings of heads of delegations.

On the afternoon of the 18th, the following spoke at the plenary session: Head of the Cambodian delegation, Norodom Sihanouk; Head of the Ceylon delegation, John Kotelawala; Head of the Egyptian delegation, Nasser; Head of the Gold Coast delegation, Komla Agbeli Gbedemah; Head of the Iranian delegation, Jalal Abdoh; Head of the Iraqi delegation, Fadhel al-Jamali.

Head of the Cambodian delegation, Sihanouk, said that in the past few weeks, the world's attention has been focused on this conference, which is the first in history to bring us countries together. He said that his country is determined to take the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the guiding principles of its national policy and hopes to apply them to the greatest extent. He expressed his belief that the conference will make its most important contribution to freedom, equality, welfare, and especially to peace among all peoples.

Head of the Egyptian delegation, Prime Minister Nasser, said that the conference reflects the deep desire of all peoples: that ways should be sought to enable mankind to regain true and lasting peace based on justice and equality of rights for all nations.

Nasser listed the conditions he believes are necessary for achieving true world peace. He emphasized the importance of striving to regulate, limit, and reduce all armed forces and armaments, and to destroy weapons of mass destruction. He believes that the extremely heavy burden of armaments is tending to undermine the world's economy and is seriously hindering the world's social progress. He said that the United Nations should abide by its Charter and principles. All its decisions and actions must be based on the Charter. He said that full respect by all countries for their international obligations is an equally important condition for achieving world peace.

In condemning racial discrimination, he said that any form of discrimination not only constitutes a violation of national obligations but also harms friendly relations between countries. He said that colonialism has always been a source of world instability and must therefore be eradicated. He also pointed out the importance of raising living standards.

In addressing the issue of economic cooperation, he said that this cooperation cannot achieve its full and effective purpose unless we are all convinced that the following fundamental principles can be implemented: "First, all countries have an obligation to respect the political independence and territorial integrity of other countries and not to interfere in their affairs. Second, all countries have the right to freely choose their political and economic systems." He expressed his belief that this conference will be able to reach agreement on some concrete proposals and practical steps to make it possible to establish a permanent body to implement cooperation between Asian and African countries in cultural, economic, and social fields.

Head of the Ceylon delegation, Prime Minister Kotelawala, expressed in his speech his hope for achieving peace between nations and expressed his opposition to interfering in each other's internal affairs. He hoped that this conference will produce effective and concrete recommendations regarding economic cooperation between Asian and African countries so that they can move together towards a common goal—prosperity.

The Conference Chairman announced that the conference would establish an Economic Committee and a Cultural Committee, and the two committees would hold meetings on the 19th. The plenary session will resume at 9:00 AM on the 19th.

    柬埔寨代表团团长西哈努克发言说，在过去几个星期中，全世界的注意力集中在目前这个在历史上第一次使我们这些国家相聚一堂的会议上。他说，他的国家决心把共处的五项原则作为国家政策的指针，并希望在最大的程度上应用它们。他表示相信，会议将会对自由、平等、福利，尤其是对各国人民之间的和平作出它的最重要的贡献。

    锡兰代表团团长科特拉瓦拉总理在发言中表示希望实现国家之间的和平，并且表示反对彼此干涉内政。他希望这次会议将产生关于亚非国家之间进行经济合作的有效的和具体的建议，以便它们可以一道走向共同的目标——繁荣。
