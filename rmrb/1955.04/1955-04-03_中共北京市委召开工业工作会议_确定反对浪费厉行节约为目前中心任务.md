    Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China Convenes Industrial Work Conference
    Determining Opposition to Waste and Practicing Economy as the Current Central Task

    This newspaper reports that the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an industrial work conference from March 29th to 31st, determining the guiding principles and tasks for the Party's work in 1955. At the same time, it determined that the central focus of work in the second quarter would be opposing waste and practicing economy, launching labor competitions, strengthening planning management, and ensuring the comprehensive fulfillment of the national plan.

    The conference summarized the implementation of the plan by state-owned, locally state-owned, joint state-private enterprises, and municipal transportation industries throughout the city in 1954. In 1954, the total output value of all units reached 111.3% of the plan, an increase of 26% compared to 1953; labor productivity reached 112.1% of the plan, an increase of 13.8% compared to 1953; costs were reduced by 6.2% compared to the plan, and profits reached 141.5% of the plan. Among 66 major products, 51 fulfilled the plan. The number of state-owned and joint state-private enterprises increased, and the socialist economic component accounted for 69.6% of the total industrial output value, up from 58.7% in 1953. The phenomenon of chaotic enterprise management has been reduced, and the equilibrium rate of production has been improved.

    Based on the Party's guiding principles for industrial work, the conference exposed shortcomings and errors in the work. It focused on criticizing the serious waste of manpower, materials, and raw material consumption in the past. It believes that the main shortcomings in industrial production in the past were: many enterprises failed to fully complete the national plan, neglecting the completion of labor, financial, and cost plans. First, low product quality and frequent accidents were relatively common problems. In 1954, the months with the best quality in the city's industry only saw 79% of products meeting quality standards, and in the worst months, less than 40% could meet quality standards. Product scrap losses at People's Machine Factory and six other machine factories reached 1.1 million yuan, equivalent to one-eighth of the total profits turned over by these enterprises. Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory and three other units had as many as 293 personal injury accidents throughout 1954, resulting in a loss of more than 27,000 work hours. Some factories were so serious that almost every new machine was damaged to varying degrees. Second, there were too many people and large staffing sizes, with too many non-industrial production personnel and management personnel. For example, at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, although pig iron production in 1954 increased by 13.4% compared to 1952, the number of people increased by 25%, most notably the number of staff, which increased by 91%. Third, raw material consumption was high, and the phenomenon of capital backlog was serious. Some units purchased materials several times more than needed. Individual units had no work to do for one-tenth of the year, causing the turnover of funds to exceed the state regulations by 50%.

    The conference believes that the reasons for the above-mentioned serious waste phenomena are mainly due to the low technical level of enterprises, poor technical management, and the lack of a foundation for planning management. At the same time, it seriously criticized the shortcomings of Party cadres in leading industrial work: they did not study the Party's general line in the transition period deeply and thoroughly, their political and ideological leadership in anti-waste was weak, they did not pay attention to saving funds, and they lacked a sense of cherishing state property.

    The total output value plan for 1955 is 19.1% higher than the actual completion number in 1954. Many units have more new product trial production tasks, and the requirements for product specifications and quality are more strict. Furthermore, this year, a large number of cadres will be transferred to support new factories. In order to comprehensively complete this year's national plan and carry out the struggle against waste, the conference determined that the basic tasks for 1955 are: to learn from advanced Soviet experience, continue to improve enterprise management, improve technical level, cultivate technical forces, improve product quality, practice economy, and reduce costs. At the same time, strengthen the Party's political work and construction work, promote the spirit of hard struggle, and wage a struggle against all ideas and waste phenomena that violate the general line.

    中共北京市委召开工业工作会议
    确定反对浪费厉行节约为目前中心任务
    本报讯　中共北京市委在三月二十九日到三十一日召开工业工作会议，确定了一九五五年党的工作的方针任务，同时确定第二季度工作以反对浪费、厉行节约为中心，开展劳动竞赛，加强计划管理，保证全面完成国家计划。
    会议总结了一九五四年全市国营、地方国营、公私合营企业和市政交通运输业计划执行情况。一九五四年，各单位总产值完成计划百分之一百一十一点三，比一九五三年提高了百分之二十六；劳动生产率完成计划百分之一百一十二点一，比一九五三年提高百分之十三点八；成本比计划降低百分之六点二，利润完成计划百分之一百四十一点五。在六十六种主要产品中，完成计划的有五十一种。国营、公私合营企业增加了，社会主义经济成份占工业中的总产值已由一九五三年的百分之五十八点七，上升到百分之六十九点六。企业管理混乱现象有了减少，生产均衡率有了提高。
    会议根据党对工业工作的方针，揭发了工作中的缺点和错误。着重批判了过去在人力、物力和原材料消耗上的严重浪费现象。认为过去在工业生产中存在的主要缺点是：许多企业不能全面完成国家计划，忽视劳动、财务、成本计划的完成。首先，产品质量低、事故多是比较普遍的问题。一九五四年全市工业完成质量最好的月份，只有百分之七十九的品种达到质量标准，最差的月份，能达到质量标准的还不到百分之四十。人民机器厂等七个机器厂产品报废损失达一百十万元，等于这些企业全部上缴利润的八分之一。北京第一机床厂等四个单位一九五四年全年发生的人身事故多达二百九十三次，损失二万七千多工时。有些厂严重到几乎每一部新机器都受到不同程度的损坏。其次是人多编制大，非工业生产人员和管理人员过多。例如石景山钢铁厂，一九五四年的生铁产量虽比一九五二年增加了百分之十三点四，而人数却增加了百分之二十五，突出的是职员人数竟增加了百分之九十一。第三，原材料消耗大，资金积压现象严重。有的单位购买的材料超过需要几倍以上。有个别单位全年有十分之一的时间没有工作做，使流动资金积压超过国家规定百分之五十。
    会议认为造成上述严重浪费现象的原因，主要是企业中的技术水平低，技术管理不善，计划管理没有打下基础。同时严肃地批判了党的干部在领导工业工作中的缺点：对党在过渡时期的总路线学习得不深不透，在反浪费方面的政治思想领导薄弱，不重视节约资金，缺乏爱护国家财产的观念。
    一九五五年的总产值计划要比一九五四年的实际完成数提高百分之十九点一，不少单位有更多新产品的试制任务，对产品规格和质量的要求也更严格了，并且今年还要抽调大批干部支援新厂。为了全面地完成今年国家计划和开展反浪费的斗争，会议确定一九五五年的基本任务是：学习苏联先进经验，继续改进企业管理，提高技术水平，培养技术力量，改进产品质量，厉行节约，降低成本。同时加强党的政治工作和建设工作，提倡艰苦奋斗精神，向一切违反总路线的思想和浪费现象进行斗争。
