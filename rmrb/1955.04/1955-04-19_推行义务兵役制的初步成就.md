    Preliminary Achievements in Implementing the Compulsory Military Service System

    The work of conscripting and replenishing soldiers for 1954 has now been successfully concluded. This is of great significance for strengthening our national defense, safeguarding the achievements of the revolution, and safeguarding socialist construction. In order to replenish the People's Liberation Army's troops, gradually change the voluntary military system to a compulsory military service system, and accelerate our country's modernized national defense construction, the Government Administration Council issued an order in September 1954 for the conscription and replenishment of soldiers. This order stipulated the conscription time, length of service, physical standards for enlistment, and specific policies regarding conscription, deferment, and ineligibility for conscription. This marked the beginning of our country's implementation of the compulsory military service system. After the order was announced, the people of the whole country warmly supported it, and the broad masses of young people regarded it as a good opportunity to fulfill the rights and obligations conferred by the Constitution. They actively signed up for conscription, requesting to take on the glorious duty of defending the motherland. A vigorous mass movement quickly formed across the country, setting off a wave of enthusiasm among young people of eligible age to sign up for conscription. Many touching examples emerged, such as parents sending their sons, wives sending their husbands, and brothers competing to enlist. Many young people, fearing that they would be restricted by quotas and unable to realize their aspirations, submitted applications before the start of the conscription and replenishment work, requesting priority for conscription. In some areas, over 90 percent of young people of eligible age signed up. The new recruits who were finally approved for enlistment were all energetic and outstanding young people, a large proportion of whom were members of the Communist Youth League, militiamen, and key members of various production fronts. Many young people, although they also met the enlistment requirements and had repeatedly applied and strived to enlist, were ultimately not approved due to limited conscription quotas. In the end, they accepted advice, determined to go back and train hard, and strive to enlist next time. In areas where there was no conscription task, many young people of eligible age repeatedly applied, requesting permission to enlist and become glorious national defense soldiers.
    The enthusiastic conscription of the broad masses of young people shows that the patriotism and revolutionary heroism of our people have been greatly enhanced through long-term revolutionary warfare and political and ideological education since liberation. They not only demand that their country be built into a great socialist country, but also demand to use their own strength to defend the motherland and defend the great cause of socialist construction. They have a high level of political awareness and a firm fighting will, and are able to combine personal interests with overall interests, and immediate interests with long-term interests. They resolutely support the compulsory military service system with practical actions. Facts have proved that the doubts expressed by some state functionaries about whether the compulsory military service system can be smoothly implemented are unfounded. Their ideological understanding lags far behind reality.
    The work of conscripting and replenishing soldiers has been successfully completed. The completion of this work has strengthened the People's Liberation Army with new forces, and has also enabled the broad masses of people to begin to recognize that the compulsory military service system is a most progressive and reasonable system, which can both strengthen national defense forces and enhance construction forces. Therefore, it has laid a good foundation for the implementation of the compulsory military service system. However, it must also be pointed out that this conscription and replenishment of soldiers is only the beginning of the implementation of the compulsory military service system. The publicity and education are not yet widespread and in-depth, and are not balanced across regions. Individual regions and a small number of staff members have not seriously implemented the policies, or the working methods are inappropriate, which has led to certain shortcomings and errors in the work, causing certain illusions among the masses. Changing from a voluntary military system to a compulsory military service system is a major reform in our country's military system, which cannot be completed in a single day. Moreover, regular conscription will be carried out every year in the future. Therefore, Party committees and governments at all levels should regard patriotic education and publicity of the compulsory military service system to the people as a regular task, and should not be satisfied with this year's achievements. After this year's conscription task is completed, they should stop or relax this publicity and education work. The domestically hidden enemies have tried every possible means to spread rumors, sow discord, and distort propaganda during our conscription and replenishment of soldiers. In the future, they will inevitably continue to carry out these despicable acts. If we neglect the publicity of the compulsory military service system and the education of loving and defending the motherland, we will certainly create many loopholes for the enemy to exploit. This is something that must be constantly guarded against.
    The main advantage of the compulsory military service system is that it can accumulate a strong reserve force for the country, while reducing the number of active-duty soldiers. After the implementation of this system, there is a certain quota for conscripting soldiers every year. This year, the number of people who signed up for conscription exceeded the state-stipulated conscription quota by more than ten times. In the future, under normal circumstances, the number of people conscripted each year will inevitably not be able to meet the demands of the broad masses of young people to enlist. This requires us to patiently persuade and educate those young people who voluntarily sign up for conscription and pass the physical examination but are not approved for enlistment, commend their patriotic enthusiasm, explain the reasons why they cannot be fully approved for enlistment, point out that there will be opportunities for service in the future, and encourage them to work diligently in production, continue to actively exercise, and prepare to respond to the call again. We must not ignore them or fail to inquire about them, so as not to harm their patriotic enthusiasm. For the families of enlisted young people, we must also strengthen education, inspire their sense of honor and patriotic enthusiasm, call on them to actively engage in production, and constantly encourage their loved ones in the front to study hard and become talented people who are both literate and martial.
    In order to smoothly realize this major reform in our country's military system, leading organs at all levels, especially the military service work organs, must conscientiously summarize the experience of this conscription and replenishment of soldiers. Even imperfect and piecemeal experiences or lessons are extremely valuable. The idea that this conscription work has been completed and that everything is going well is completely wrong and must be prevented.
    The new recruits conscripted this year are arriving in various units one after another. The officers and veteran soldiers of the People's Liberation Army should welcome them with brotherly enthusiasm, patiently educate and help them, and improve their political, military, and cultural levels. The young people who have enlisted have been entrusted by the people of the motherland and their own relatives, and have gloriously become members of the People's Liberation Army. Your service in the army is not long, only a short period of three to five years. Therefore, you must seize the opportunity, work doubly hard to study, maintain and carry forward the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army, serve the people wholeheartedly, and quickly train yourselves into strong national defense soldiers with high political awareness, strong organization and discipline, and the ability to skillfully master modern military technology.

### 推行义务兵役制的初步成就

    推行义务兵役制的初步成就
    一九五四年度的征集补充兵员的工作，现在已经胜利结束了。这对于加强我国的国防力量、保卫革命成果、保卫社会主义建设是具有重大意义的。为了补充人民解放军的兵员和逐步改变志愿兵制为义务兵役制，加速我国现代化的国防建设，一九五四年九月政务院发布了征集补充兵员的命令，规定了征集时间、服役年限和应征入伍的体格标准，以及应征、缓征和不得征集的各项具体政策。这是我国推行义务兵役制的开始。命令公布之后，全国人民热烈拥护，广大青年更认为这是自己履行宪法给予的权利和义务的好机会，纷纷自动报名应征，要求走上保卫祖国的光荣岗位。全国各地迅速形成了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，掀起了适龄青年报名应征的热潮，出现了许多父母送儿子、妻子送丈夫和兄弟争相应征的动人事例。不少青年唯恐受到名额限制，不能实现自己的志愿，在征集补充兵员工作未开始以前就纷纷提出申请，要求优先应征。有的地区适龄青年报名者达百分之九十以上。最后被批准入伍的新兵，都是生气勃勃的优秀青年，其中很大部分是青年团员、民兵和各个生产战线上的骨干分子。有许多青年虽然也适合入伍条件，并且他们曾经再三申请，争取入伍，但因征集名额有限，终于没有被批准。最后他们接受劝告，决心回去好好锻炼，争取下次入伍。在没有征集任务的地区，也有不少适龄青年三番五次提出申请，要求准许他们应征入伍，做一个光荣的国防战士。
    广大青年的热烈应征，说明我国人民经过长时期的革命战争和解放以来的政治教育和思想教育，爱国主义的热情和革命英雄主义的精神已经大大提高。他们不仅要求把自己的国家建设成伟大的社会主义国家，而且要求用自己的力量来保卫祖国，保卫伟大的社会主义建设事业。他们有高度的政治觉悟和坚强的战斗意志，能够把个人利益和整体利益、眼前利益和长远利益结合起来。他们用实际行动坚决支持义务兵役制。事实证明，有一些国家工作人员对义务兵役制能否顺利实行表示怀疑是毫无根据的。他们的思想认识远远地落到现实的后面去了。
    征集补充兵员的工作胜利完成了。这一工作的完成，使我国人民解放军增加了新的力量，同时也使广大人民开始认识了义务兵役制是一种最进步、最合理、既能增强国防力量、又能增强建设力量的好制度，因而为实行义务兵役制打下了良好的基础。但是也必须指出，这次征集补充兵员仅仅是推行义务兵役制的开始，宣传教育还不够普遍和深入，在地区上也不够平衡。个别地区和少数工作人员没有认真执行政策，或者工作方法不适当，这就使工作中仍然发生了某些缺点和错误，在群众中造成某些错觉。由志愿兵制改成义务兵役制度，是我国军事制度上的重大改革，并非一朝一夕所能完成的事；而且今后每年都要进行定期征集，因此各级党委和政府就应该把对人民群众进行爱国主义教育和义务兵役制的宣传作为经常工作，而不应该满足于今年的成绩，在今年的征集任务完成以后，就停止或放松了这种宣传教育工作。国内暗藏的敌人在我们征集补充兵员期间曾经千方百计地进行造谣挑拨和歪曲宣传，今后他们必然还会继续进行这些龌龊的勾当。我们如果忽视了义务兵役制的宣传和热爱祖国、保卫祖国的教育，就一定会给敌人造成许多可乘之隙。这是必须经常保持警惕的。
    义务兵役制度的主要优点，在于它能够为国家积累强大的预备兵员，同时减少常备兵数量。实行这个制度以后，每年征集兵员是有一定名额的。今年报名应征的人数，超过国家规定的征集名额十倍以上；今后在正常状况下，每年征集的人数也势必不能满足广大青年应征的要求。这就需要我们对那些自动报名应征和经过体格检查合格而未批准入伍的青年，进行耐心的说服教育，表扬他们的爱国热情，说明不能完全批准入伍的道理，指出今后还有服役机会，鼓励他们安心生产，继续积极锻炼身体，准备再次响应征召，而不能漠然置之，不加过问，以致伤害他们的爱国热情。对于入伍青年的家属，也必须加强教育，启发他们的光荣感和爱国热情，号召他们积极生产，并且经常鼓励自己在前方的亲人，努力学习，成为能文能武的人材。
    为了顺利地实现我国军事制度上的这一重大改革，各级领导机关特别是兵役工作机关必须认真总结这次征集补充兵员工作的经验。即便是不完善的和点滴的经验或教训，也都是极其宝贵的。认为这次征集工作已经完成，就算万事大吉的想法，是完全错误的因而必须防止。
    今年征集的新兵正在陆续到达各个部队，人民解放军的军官和老战士，应该以兄弟般的热情欢迎他们，耐心地教育和帮助他们，提高他们的政治、军事和文化水平。入伍的青年们受到祖国人民和自己亲人的委托，光荣地成为人民解放军的一员，你们在部队中的服役期间不长，只有三年到五年这么一段短短的期间，因此你们必须抓紧时机，加倍努力学习，保持和发扬人民解放军的光荣传统，全心全意为人民服务，把自己迅速锻炼成为政治觉悟很高、组织性和纪律性很强、能够熟练地掌握现代化军事技术的坚强的国防战士。
