More than 100 people from Japanese business circles and management groups, as well as representatives of local enterprises and industrial trade unions, participated in the meeting.

At the meeting, Suzuki Kazuo, Yamamoto Kumao, Kimura Kihachiro, and others, who participated in the Sino-Japanese trade agreement negotiations on the Japanese side, reported on the course of the negotiations and discussed how to promote the government to guarantee the conclusion and realization of the new Sino-Japanese trade agreement. The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution at the end.

The resolution stated: The development of Sino-Japanese trade negotiations has now reached a decisive stage, which depends on whether the Japanese government fulfills its responsibilities. The resolution pointed out that Prime Minister Hatoyama and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu also expressed their intention to strive to improve trade with China in their policy and diplomatic speeches in the Diet on the 25th. Therefore, it is hoped that the government can listen to the opinions of the people and deal with this Sino-Japanese trade negotiation.

The resolution finally demanded that the government assume the responsibility for signing a payment agreement between China and Japan, assume the responsibility for establishing trade representative offices in each other's countries, and be responsible for lifting the embargo.

The meeting also decided to send this resolution to the Japanese government and representatives of various parties.
