    The Italian People's Struggle for Peace and Freedom
    Gao Ji

    This April 25th marks the tenth anniversary of the national uprising of the Italian people against the German Nazi occupiers and the Italian fascist ruling forces. The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party has called on all Italian citizens to commemorate this day, calling on everyone to unite under the banner of the resistance movement to defend peace and the freedoms stipulated in the constitution. Participants in the resistance movement have responded to the call of the Italian Communist Party by holding large-scale gatherings in various places, demanding strengthened unity and striving to realize the ideals of the resistance movement.

    The national uprising of April 25, 1945, was a glorious page in the Italian people's heroic struggle for national liberation and anti-fascism under the leadership of the Italian Communist Party during World War II. Due to the tireless activities of the Communists, the Italian people established a unified anti-fascist front in the years of fascist rule and Nazi occupation, and resolutely resisted fascist rule and Nazi occupation. The Communist Party also organized hundreds of guerrilla units to launch extensive battles against the Nazi occupiers and fascist armies, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. In the situation where the Soviet army defeated the Nazi army and marched victoriously towards Germany and Southeast Europe, the Italian people, under the call of the Communist Party, launched a national uprising on April 25, 1945, liberating the northern Italian regions that were still under Nazi occupation at that time, and achieved a major victory. The Nazi occupation forces were completely driven out of the Italian territory, and fascist rule was destroyed.

    On the basis of the victory of the resistance movement, the Italian people decided in a national referendum in June 1946 to abolish the monarchy and establish a republic. Thanks to the powerful movement of the masses of the people to strive for democracy, freedom and progress, the Constituent Assembly adopted the constitution in December 1947, stipulating the implementation of extensive political and economic democratic reforms and stipulating the freedom of speech, publication, and assembly for working people.

    However, the Italian people's efforts to implement democratic reforms were interfered with by the United States almost from the beginning. As soon as the American and British Allied Control Organizations were established in the liberated areas of the north, they abolished the decrees of the National Liberation Committee confiscating the property of large capitalists who were attached to Germany, the factories were returned to their original owners, the peasants lost their land again, and the fascists who had been arrested by the National Liberation Committee regained their freedom. With the support of the United States, the Catholic Church, and royalists, the clerical faction - the Christian Democratic Party - seized the main power of the country. With the implementation of the Truman Doctrine, the clerical faction, under the direction of the United States, squeezed the Communist Party and the Socialist Party out of the government, restored the bourgeois dictatorship, and gradually embarked on the road of fascism again. The reactionary government of the clerical faction not only failed to implement the democratic reforms stipulated in the constitution in the political and economic life of the country, but instead tried its best to maintain and restore the past privileged status of monopoly organizations, royalists, and fascists. The land reform stipulated in the constitution has not been implemented, and most of the peasants still live under the oppression of a backward economic system. The living conditions of the working people continue to deteriorate, and the unemployed and semi-unemployed population has reached four million. The Christian Democratic Party government has also taken various measures to destroy the democratic rights of the working people guaranteed by the constitution and to suppress democratic and socially progressive forces.

    In order to suppress the opposition of the domestic working people and maintain their reactionary rule and the high profits of monopoly capital, the ruling group in Italy made Italy dependent on the American aggressive bloc. The provisions of the Italian Peace Treaty on the withdrawal of foreign troops and the limitation of armaments have been violated. Italy joined the North Atlantic aggressive bloc and followed the United States in expanding its military and preparing for war. American troops have returned to Italian soil and American military bases have been established everywhere. The clerical ruling group spared no effort to support the American policy of rearming West Germany, forcing Italy to accept the Paris Agreements, enabling Italy and the German militarist forces to re-form a war alliance, and risking the danger of being dragged into a devastating military adventure again.

    These reactionary measures of the Italian ruling group in its domestic and foreign policies have caused the Italian economy to stagnate and suffer serious difficulties, and have largely lost its political independence, while at the same time making Italy's security increasingly seriously threatened. The fruits that the Italian people gained at the cost of bloodshed and sacrifice in the resistance movement are in danger of being completely deprived.

    This is what the Italian people can never tolerate. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Italian working people are persisting in a large-scale struggle for peace, democracy, freedom and social progress. In September 1953, eight million workers held a national general strike, in April of the same year, two million agricultural workers went on strike, in 1950, nineteen million people signed the Stockholm Appeal, and recently, in a short period of time, another six million people have signed the World Peace Council's Vienna Conference appeal to the people of the world. These examples show the powerful force of the Italian working people united to defend peace and fight for life and democratic rights.

    The election held in June 1953 was a serious contest between the democratic and anti-democratic forces in Italy. In this contest, the attempt of the clerical faction, which was actively supported by the United States, to strike at the democratic forces was shamefully defeated. The election results showed that the influence of the democratic forces had greatly increased, while the Christian Democratic Party had reduced nearly two million votes. The new election law, which it had painstakingly manufactured in order to control the absolute majority of the parliament, lost its effect, and its dictatorial rule was shaken. Since then, the democratic forces have continued to develop significantly. The Italian Communist Party and the Italian Socialist Party have formed a close alliance, uniting other progressive and patriotic forces, and are continuing to resolutely fight to defend peace and freedom; oppose the imperialists and domestic reactionaries' evil plan to restore fascist rule in Italy and drag Italy into military adventures once again. The Italian people's struggle for peace, democracy, freedom and social progress is an insurmountable obstacle to preventing the American aggressive bloc and the reactionary forces of the Italian clerical faction from dragging Italy onto the road of fascism and war.

    The goal of the Italian people's current struggle is to establish a government of peace and implement the democratic reforms stipulated in the constitution. To this end, all progressive forces in Italy are striving to strengthen unity and establish a broad united front including the majority of the residents.

    The spirit of the resistance movement is playing a new role in the political life of the Italian people; the widespread activities commemorating the tenth anniversary of the national uprising fully demonstrate the great vitality of the Italian people's opposition to fascism and imperialist aggressive war. Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti pointed out at a rally held in Milan on April 17: "We must achieve a new unity of the democratic forces who cherish the ideals of resistance, and this unity will lead the Italian people to new victories."

    All progressive forces in the world are concerned about the struggle of the Italian people. The Chinese people support the efforts of the Italian people under the leadership of the Italian Communist Party to strive for peace, democracy, freedom and social progress, are happy for the strengthening of their united forces, and are deeply convinced that the Italian people's just struggle will surely be victorious.

    意大利人民为和平和自由而斗争
    高集
    今年四月二十五日是意大利人民反对德国纳粹占领者和意大利法西斯统治势力全国起义十周年。意大利共产党中央委员会号召意大利全体公民纪念这个日子，号召大家团结在抵抗运动的旗帜下，来保卫和平和宪法的规定的自由。抵抗运动的参加者响应意大利共产党的号召，在各地举行规模盛大的集会，要求加强团结，为争取实现抵抗运动的理想而斗争。
    一九四五年四月二十五日的全国起义，是意大利人民在意大利共产党的领导下，在第二次世界大战期间进行的争取民族解放和反法西斯主义的英勇斗争的光辉的一页。由于共产党人的不屈不挠的活动，意大利人民在法西斯统治和纳粹占领的年月中建立了反法西斯的统一战线，对法西斯统治和纳粹的占领进行了坚决的抵抗。共产党更组织了几百个游击队，对纳粹占领者和法西斯军队展开广泛的战斗，给了敌人以惨重的打击。在苏联军队击溃了纳粹军队并向德国和东南欧胜利进军的形势下，意大利人民在共产党的号召下，于一九四五年四月二十五日举行了全国起义，解放了当时还在纳粹占领下的意大利北部地区，取得了重大的胜利。纳粹占领军在意大利的土地上完全被驱逐出去，法西斯统治被摧毁了。
    在抵抗运动的胜利的基础上，意大利人民在一九四六年六月的全民投票中决定取消君主政体而建立了共和国。由于人民群众争取民主、自由和进步的强大运动，一九四七年十二月制宪议会通过了宪法，规定实行广泛的政治和经济的民主改革并规定了劳动人民的言论、出版、集会的自由权利。
    但是，意大利人民实现民主改革的努力几乎从一开始就受到美国的干涉。美国和英国的盟国管制机构一在北部解放地区设立起来，就取消了民族解放委员会没收附德的大资本家财产的法令，工厂被交还原主，农民又失去了土地，已经被民族解放委员会逮捕的法西斯分子又得到了自由。在美国、天主教会和保皇分子的支持下，教权派——天主教民主党掌握了国家的主要权力。随着杜鲁门主义的实施，教权派在美国的指使下，把共产党和社会党排挤出了政府，恢复了资产阶级的独裁政治并从新一步步走上法西斯的道路。教权派的反动政府不但没有在国家政治和经济生活中实施宪法所规定的民主改革，反而极力保持和恢复垄断组织、保皇分子和法西斯分子过去的特权地位。宪法所规定的土地改革没有实行，大部分农民依然生活在落后的经济制度的压迫下。劳动人民生活条件不断恶化，失业和半失业的人口达四百万人。天主教民主党政府还采取各种措施，以摧毁宪法所保障的劳动人民的民主权利，镇压民主和社会进步的力量。
    为了镇压国内劳动人民的反对，维持它们的反动统治和垄断资本的高额利润，意大利的统治集团使意大利依附于美国侵略集团。对意和约中关于撤退外国军队和限制军备的规定遭到了破坏。意大利参加了北大西洋侵略集团，并追随美国进行扩军备战。美国军队又回到了意大利的土地上，到处设立了美国的军事基地。教权派统治集团并不遗余力地支持美国重新武装西德的政策，强使意大利接受巴黎协定，使意大利和德国军国主义势力重新结为战争同盟，重冒被卷入遭到毁灭的军事冒险的危险。
    意大利统治集团在对内对外政策方面的这些反动措施，使意大利的经济陷于停滞并遭到严重的困难，并在很大程度上丧失了它的政治上的独立，同时使意大利的安全也日益受到严重的威胁。意大利人民在抵抗运动中以流血牺牲的代价所争得的成果，有被完全剥夺掉的危险。
    这是意大利人民所决不能容忍的。在共产党的领导下，意大利劳动人民为争取和平、民主、自由和社会进步坚持地进行着规模巨大的斗争。一九五三年九月八百万工人举行全国总罢工，同年四月二百万农业工人罢工，一九五○年一千九百万人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，最近，在短短的时期内，又已经有六百万人在世界和平理事会维也纳会议告全世界人民书上签了名。这些例子显示了意大利劳动人民团结起来保卫和平、争取生活和民主权利的强大力量。
    一九五三年六月举行的选举是意大利民主和反民主力量之间的一次严重较量。在这次较量中，得到美国积极支持的教权派打击民主力量的企图遭到了可耻的失败。选举结果表明民主力量的影响有了巨大的增长，天主教民主党却减少了将近二百万选票，它为了控制议会绝对多数而费尽心机制造的新选举法失掉作用，它的独裁统治发生了动摇。从那时以来，民主力量继续有明显的发展。意大利共产党和意大利社会党结成紧密的联盟，团结其他进步和爱国力量，正在继续为保卫和平和自由而坚决斗争；反对帝国主义和国内反动派企图在意大利恢复法西斯统治和把意大利再一次卷入军事冒险的罪恶计划。意大利人民争取和平、民主、自由和社会进步的斗争，是阻止美国侵略集团和意大利教权派反动势力把意大利拖向法西斯和战争的道路上的不可逾越的障碍。
    意大利人民当前斗争的目标是成立一个和平政府和实施宪法所规定的民主改革。为此意大利的一切进步力量正在为加强团结，建立一个包括大多数居民的广泛的统一战线而努力。
    抵抗运动的精神正在意大利人民的政治生活中发挥新的作用；纪念全国起义十周年的广泛活动，充分显示意大利人民反对法西斯和帝国主义侵略战争的伟大活力。意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂在四月十七日在米兰举行的集会上指出：“我们必须获致怀有抵抗理想的民主力量的新的团结，这种团结将会把意大利人民导向新的胜利。”
    全世界一切进步的力量都关怀着意大利人民的斗争。中国人民支持意大利人民在意大利共产党领导下争取和平、民主、自由和社会进步的努力，因他们团结力量的增强而高兴，并深信意大利人民的正义斗争一定胜利。
