To Ensure Unimpeded Navigation on the Sichuan River

The Sichuan River is an important part of the Yangtze River transportation line. In recent years, in order to expand the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production and people's lives, the government has carried out整治 (rectification and improvement) work on the Sichuan inland river, opening up many new routes, eliminating three hundred and eighty-five dangerous shoals, and repairing five hundred and sixty-five kilometers of towpaths. The difficulties brought by the many shoals and rapid waters of the Sichuan River to navigation have been gradually overcome.

Now, the整治 (rectification and improvement) project of the Sichuan River is still continuing. The Sichuan River 整治 (rectification and improvement) Engineering Corps has blasted the main hidden reef of the Fangtan shoal – the Mixin Stone – and the shallow reefs of the Suishi shoal. In the process of blasting reefs, the workers improved the methods of explosion, loading explosives, and stabilizing the ship's position, which not only saved explosives but also improved work efficiency.

    要使川江畅通无阻
    川江是长江运输线上的重要组成部分。几年来，政府为了扩大城乡物资交流，适应工农业生产和人民生活的需要，对川江内河进行了整治工作，开辟了许多新的航线；消灭了三百八十五个险滩，整修了五百六十五公里纤道。逐步克服了滩多水急的川江给航运带来的困难。
    现在，川江的整治工程仍在继续进行。川江整治工程总队已将川江方滩的主要暗礁——米心石，以及碎石滩的浅礁炸毁。在炸礁过程中，工人们改进了爆炸、装药和稳定船位等方法，不仅节省了炸药，而且提高了工作效率。
