Breaking Down Excuses for Restricting Criticism
    Zhong Huai

The Party requires leading organs and cadres at all levels to adopt a warm welcome and firm protection attitude towards the criticism in newspapers that reflects the opinions of the masses, and requires them to support everyone who puts forward healthy criticism. Only in this way can bottom-up criticism in newspapers be expanded. However, some responsible cadres of Party committees use various excuses to restrict criticism in newspapers. The Party newspaper has the responsibility to break down various excuses and create favorable conditions for carrying out bottom-up criticism in newspapers.

On February 19th, the "Party Life" column of the Fushun Daily published a letter from a Party member entitled "Why Doesn't Liu Chenghai Participate in Organizational Activities?" This letter was written by Comrade Wang Bin from the Victory Mine of the Fushun Mining Bureau. In his letter, he criticized Liu Chenghai, a member of the general branch committee and secretary of the office branch of the Victory Mine, for emphasizing administrative work and being unwilling to do Party work, and even unwilling to attend Party meetings. For example, the branch where Liu Chenghai was located decided to hold a general meeting of Party members on January 21 to re-elect the branch committee, but Liu Chenghai, as the branch secretary, not only pushed all the preparatory work to other members, but also did not attend the general meeting of Party members, but was busy playing chess in the trade union office. It was completely correct for the Fushun Daily to publish Comrade Wang Bin's letter and criticize Liu Chenghai's erroneous thinking and behavior.

In principle—that is, in accordance with the principles of the Party—after seeing this criticism in the newspaper, Comrade Di Gan’yi, the Party Secretary of the Victory Mine, should have first thought of his leadership responsibility and considered how to seriously deal with this criticism. For example, as the Party Secretary, was he completely unaware of the mistake of a responsible cadre of the general branch and branch under the Party Committee in not attaching importance to Party work and not participating in organizational life? If he knew, had he struggled against this error? Now that someone has raised public criticism in the newspaper, how should he educate Liu Chenghai himself to recognize and correct his mistakes, and use this matter to educate everyone to learn from the lessons, and at the same time encourage and support the Communist Party members who dare to fight against unhealthy tendencies? But Di Gan'yi did not do this. He took a different approach. After hearing that Liu Chenghai was "emotional" because of the criticism, he called the critic Wang Bin to the secretary's office and asked him a series of questions: "Did the general branch know about your writing this article?" "He is a member of the general branch committee, and he can carry out criticism in the committee. He should not engage in intrigue in the newspaper under a pseudonym!"....

This questioning is very unreasonable and completely violates the principles of the Party. On March 16th, the Fushun Daily published another article, pointing out that the Fushun Daily is the organ of the Fushun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and carrying out criticism in this newspaper did not deviate from the Party organization; it also pointed out that the Party Constitution and the Party Central Committee's resolution on criticism clearly stipulate that Party members have the right to carry out criticism and self-criticism in Party newspapers and periodicals, and no one is allowed to infringe on this right. This broke down the excuse used by Di Gan'yi to restrict criticism.

People like Di Gan'yi, who do not support and encourage bottom-up criticism, but attempt to restrict inner-Party democracy and restrict newspaper criticism, are by no means one or two in our Party. The newspaper should expose such people and vigorously support all correct criticism from the masses. Party committees at all levels should also guarantee this right of criticism for Party members and the people.

    打破限制批评的借口
    锺怀
    党要求各级领导机关和干部对于报纸上反映群众意见的批评，采取热烈欢迎和坚决保护的态度，要求他们支持每一个提出健康批评的人。这样，报纸上的自下而上的批评才能展开和扩大。但是有些党委的负责干部却以种种借口来限制报纸的批评。党报有责任来打破各种借口，为在报纸上开展自下而上的批评创造有利的条件。
    二月十九日，抚顺日报党的生活栏发表了一封党员来信，题目是“刘成海为啥不过组织生活”。这封信是抚顺矿务局胜利矿的王滨同志写的。他在信中批评了胜利矿机关总支委员兼办公室支部书记刘成海强调行政工作忙而不愿做党的工作，甚至连党的会议都不愿参加。例如，刘成海所在的支部决定在一月二十一日开党员大会改选支部委员会，可是身为支部书记的刘成海不仅把一切准备工作都推给别的委员去做，就连党员大会也不去参加，而在工会办公室里忙于下棋。抚顺日报把王滨同志的信发表出来，对刘成海这种错误思想和行为提出批评，是完全正确的。
    照理——也就是说按照党的原则，胜利矿的党委书记邸干义同志在看到报上的这个批评以后，应当首先想到自己的领导责任，并考虑怎样严肃地处理这个批评。例如，作为党委书记，自己过去对党委会所属总支和支部的一个负责干部不重视党的工作和不参加组织生活的错误，是否一无所知呢？如果知道，是否同这种错误进行过斗争呢？现在既然有人在报纸上提出了公开的批评，又应当怎样教育刘成海本人认识错误改正错误，并用这件事来教育大家吸取教训，同时对勇于向不良倾向作斗争的共产党员给予鼓励和支持呢？但是邸干义并没有这样做。他采取了另外一种做法。他在听到刘成海因受批评而“闹情绪”后，把批评者王滨叫到书记办公室来，向他提出了一连串的责问：“你写这篇稿子总支知道不？”“他是个总支委员，满可以在委员会上开展批评，不应当用笔名在报纸上勾心斗角！”……。
    这种责问是非常无理的，完全违反了党的原则。抚顺日报在三月十六日又发表了一篇文章，指出抚顺日报是中共抚顺市委的机关报，在这个报纸上开展批评并没有离开党的组织；还指出党章和党中央的关于批评的决议明确规定党员有权在党的报纸刊物上开展批评和自我批评，这个权利不准任何人侵犯。这就打破了邸干义用以限制批评的借口。
    像邸干义这样不是支持和鼓励自下而上的批评，而是企图限制党内民主、限制报纸批评的人，在我们党内决不是一个、两个。报纸对于这样的人，就要揭发，就要大力支持一切来自群众的正确的批评。各级党委也应当保障党员和人民群众的这种批评权利。
