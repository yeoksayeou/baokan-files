    Instructions Regarding the Cotton-Grain Price Ratio for 1955

    (1) In recent years, thanks to the state's implementation of a reasonable cotton-grain price ratio, the adoption of measures to support increased cotton production, and the efforts of cotton farmers to increase production, the unit area yield of cotton has continuously increased, and the lives of cotton farmers have improved year by year. Last year, due to severe disasters, the total national cotton production failed to meet the original plan, which affected this year's textile industrial production. In order to meet the growing needs of China's textile industry and the people, this year it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of appropriately increasing the cotton planting area and increasing the yield per unit area, without affecting grain production.

    The cotton-grain price ratio last year was generally beneficial to the normal development of cotton fields and the improvement of cotton farmers' lives. Therefore, the cotton-grain price ratio this year will generally remain unchanged from the standards stipulated last year.

    (2) The unified purchase price of cotton will generally remain unchanged from last year's price, and it is stipulated that the commercial departments will uniformly control the minimum standard or above the highest standard of the prescribed price ratio, based on the county seat as a unit.

    (3) In order to promote the development of high-quality cotton production and improve the grade length, it has been decided to add superior-grade cotton grades and reasonably increase prices. All levels of purchasing departments should resolutely implement the policy of "superior quality, superior price, and low quality, low price" to encourage cotton farmers to develop the cultivation of good cotton. In the purchasing work, we should improve the grading and inspection technology, give prices fairly and reasonably according to the grade, and strictly prohibit suppressing grades and prices.

    中华人民共和国商业部、农业部
    关于一九五五年棉粮比价的指示
    （一）几年来，由于国家实行合理的棉粮比价，采取扶植棉花增产的措施和棉农努力增产的结果，棉花单位面积产量不断提高，棉农生活逐年改善。去年由于灾情严重，全国棉花总产量未能达到原定计划，并影响今年纺织工业生产。为了适应我国纺织工业和人民日益增长的需要，今年必须继续贯彻在不影响粮食增产的前提下，适当增加棉田面积和提高单位面积产量的方针。
    去年的棉粮比价，对棉田的正常发展和棉农生活的改善，一般都是有利的。因此，今年棉粮比价一般仍照去年规定的标准不变。
    （二）棉花统购价格一般按去年价格不变，并规定以县城为单位不低于规定比价的最低标准或高于最高标准，由商业部门统一掌握。
    （三）为促进优良棉花生产的发展，提高品级长度，决定增添优级棉等级，并合理加价。各级收购部门应坚决贯彻“优级优价，低级低价”的政策，鼓励棉农发展良棉种植。在收购工作中应提高分级检验技术，公平合理按级给价，严禁压级压价。中华人民共和国商业部农业部   一九五五年四月二十二日
