Xinhua News Agency, April 6th. The Czechoslovak Jiri Trnka Puppet Theater's visit performance, sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, opened in Beijing on the evening of the 6th.

Attending the opening ceremony were people from the capital's literary and art circles and Chinese actors participating in the national puppet show and shadow play performance meeting held in Beijing. Czechoslovak Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to China, Šmíd, embassy staff, and members of the Czechoslovak Army Central House volleyball team, who are visiting China, were also invited to attend the opening ceremony.

Vice Minister of Culture Chen Kehan delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the Ministry of Culture and Chinese literary and art workers at the opening ceremony. He said: Czechoslovakia is a country with an excellent puppet art tradition. Czechoslovak puppet artists have inherited a rich national heritage, fully mastered the creative methods of socialist realism, and use lively and vivid forms to make puppet art serve the country's current socialist construction. At present, in the vast urban and rural areas of Czechoslovakia, puppet shows are not only performed by professional troupes, but also become one of the most popular amateur cultural and art forms among the masses. We should learn from Czechoslovak puppet artists, learn from each other's strengths and overcome our weaknesses, and bring forth new ideas to promote the development of Chinese puppet art. He also congratulated the further consolidation and development of the friendship between the Chinese and Czech people.

At the opening ceremony, the head of the Czechoslovak Jiri Trnka Puppet Theater, Mr. Pelíšek, also spoke. He said that the exchange of cultural arts between our two countries is of great significance. Although our two countries are geographically far apart, the brotherly feelings of our two peoples are closely linked because we are fighting side by side for the common goal of building socialism and safeguarding world peace.

After the opening ceremony, Czechoslovak puppet artists performed the four-act fairy tale "Golden Hair," which was warmly praised by the audience.

The Czechoslovak Jiri Trnka Puppet Theater is one of the first five professional theaters established after the founding of the Czechoslovak Republic. Since its establishment in 1949, this troupe has repeatedly achieved brilliant results in national professional theater competitions.
