Guangdong Plans to Plant Over 7,000 Mu of Ramie

Guangdong Province has decided to vigorously develop ramie production this year. On the basis of the 5,500+ mu of ramie planted in 1954, the province plans to expand by 7,400+ mu, reaching over 13,000 mu.

Ramie fiber is long, elastic, has great tensile strength, and is resistant to mildew. It can be used to manufacture various high-grade fine cloths, marine fishing nets, mechanical drive belts, parachutes, etc., and is an important material needed for industrial and national defense construction. The broad masses of farmers in Guangdong Province are highly enthusiastic about increasing ramie production.

Agricultural departments in various parts of Guangdong Province have actively carried out seed collection and technical guidance work. Lechang County, the key ramie cultivation area in the province, plans to expand its ramie planting area by 5,000 mu this year. The Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture assisted the county in holding a technical training class, attended by 219 farmers, who universally learned advanced cultivation and management techniques.

Currently, farmers in northern Guangdong, eastern Guangdong, and central Guangdong, and other regions have already begun sowing ramie. In northern Guangdong alone, over 400 mu have already been sown. (Li Shaoqiu)

    广东计划多种七千多亩苎麻
    广东省今年决定大力发展苎麻生产。全省计划在一九五四年苎麻种植面积五千五百多亩的基础上，扩大七千四百多亩，达到一万三千多亩。
    苎麻纤维长，富弹性，拉力大，抗霉力强，可用来制造各种高级细布、海洋渔网、机械转动皮带、降落伞等，是工业建设和国防建设中需要的一项重要物资。广东省广大农民对于增产苎麻积极性很高。
    广东省各地农业部门积极进行了种籽筹集和技术指导工作。全省栽培苎麻重点——乐昌县，今年准备扩大苎麻种植面积五千亩。广东省农业厅协助该县举办了技术训练班，参加学习的农民有二百一十九人，普遍学会了先进的栽培管理技术。
    现在，粤北、粤东、粤中等地区的农民已经开始播种苎麻，仅粤北部分地区就已播种四百亩以上。　（李少球）
