Heroic Bomber Pilot Song Zongzhou
Xu Gengquan

On the night of January 10, 1955, a storm raged on the East China Sea off the coast of Zhejiang, the seawater whipped into rolling waves. On this day, at the bottom of the sea in Dachen harbor, the wreckage of Chiang Kai-shek's military ships and the remains of Chiang's soldiers were buried. One of the largest "Zhong" class landing ships, which had arrived from Taiwan less than twelve hours before, emitted thick smoke and was swallowed by the surging waves.

In the barracks of a bomber unit of the frontline air force, a tall pilot with broad shoulders tossed and turned, unable to sleep due to excitement over the victory. This was Song Zongzhou, the flight squadron leader who led his entire crew and Zhang Weiliang's crew in jointly destroying this "Zhong" class landing ship.

On January 10th, Song Zongzhou and his comrades went to practice bombing exercises as usual. Their determination was to ensure that the bombs would bloom over the heads of Chiang's troops. That morning, the bombs they dropped during the exercise all hit the targets. As they were feeling happy, they suddenly received an order from the commander: "Load the bombs and prepare for combat to bomb Chiang's military ships in Dachen harbor."

The entire airport was covered in a scene of busyness and joy. Some were busy refueling, others were busy loading bombs. Red flags were raised, and the war eagles carrying heavy bombs took off in a mighty formation. A strong group of fighter planes provided cover at high altitude. Led by squadron leader Zhang Weiliang, the bomber group flew towards the skies over Dachen harbor.

That day, the sea breeze was very strong. Yan Shusen, the navigator of Song Zongzhou's crew, concentrated on correcting the course. Song Zongzhou calmly followed Yan Shusen's requests of "left" and "right," ensuring that the plane flew accurately. They were very familiar with every part of the motherland's ocean and the enemy-occupied islands along the coast. Their determination was: never allow a single enemy ship to slip out of the gunsight.

The search began. Song Zongzhou stared ahead and below, while Yan Shusen's eyes were glued to the gunsight. Suddenly, they spotted black spots ahead and below. At this time, the squadron leader issued an order via radio: "Pay attention to the search and prepare to bomb!" "There are enemy ships to the lower left, bomb the big ones!" Song Zongzhou and Yan Shusen flew in the direction indicated by the squadron leader. Song Zongzhou's voice resounded throughout the plane: "Aim calmly and pay attention to vigilance!" "Check the angle once!" "Check the angle again!" The communication chief and gunner in the rear cockpit responded. Just as the communication chief excitedly reported the good news of the squadron leader hitting the enemy ship, Yan Shusen followed up with two shouts of "Drop the bombs!" In an instant, heavy bombs broke through the atmosphere like lightning and charged towards Chiang's military ship. The communication chief in the rear cabin saw it very clearly, and he shouted at the top of his lungs: "Hit! It's on fire!" At this time, the plane became much lighter. As they circled back, looking down, plumes of thick smoke and raging fire engulfed the enemy ship.

Seven days later, Song Zongzhou's crew participated in the battle to bomb Yijiangshan Island.

On January 18th, just as dawn was breaking, the people at the airport where Song Zongzhou's unit was stationed were busy. The task was to cooperate with the army and navy to liberate Yijiangshan Island, and who could not be excited? Song Zongzhou had led the pilots in the lounge early in the morning to study the battle plan. Song Zongzhou clenched his fist and said to everyone in a loud voice: "This is our first time fighting in coordination with the army and navy, and we cannot have the slightest negligence. A slight error in our crew will affect the entire formation and the entire battle." As he spoke, he spread out a military map of Yijiangshan Island on the table. "Our task is to destroy the commanding height of the beachhead position in the northeast corner of the island, Highland 203. In this area of more than 250 square meters, there are enemy bunker groups, earthen walls, and trenches. Our army needs to land from the cliffs on the north side of the mountain. Therefore, we can only think of one thing: do everything possible to bomb out a path for the army to advance here."

The commander's order to take off came.

That day, there was sea fog. Song Zongzhou piloted the war eagle towards Yijiangshan Island in the middle of the mighty joint formation. Reaching the target airspace. In the smoke of the anti-aircraft shells fired by the enemy, Song Zongzhou's crew found the target designated by the commander, and they dumped all the heavy bombs they were carrying onto Highland 203. At this time, the bomber group and the attack aircraft group fiercely bombed and strafed the positions of Chiang's troops, and smoke and fire filled the entire Yijiangshan Island.

The air battle continued.

When Song Zongzhou and his comrades flew over Yijiangshan Island again, they saw that Highland 203 had become a scorched earth. They quickly flew over the highland forward. They saw the People's Navy warships speeding towards the beach, the guns on the ships continuously bombarding Yijiangshan Island; the infantry soldiers on the ships waved their hats and cheered at the air formation. The heroic vanguard began to land. At this time, there were our comrades and our strongholds on the island. Song Zongzhou and his comrades were moved by the magnificent lineup of the joint land, sea, and air operations. He thought that the bombs should be quickly dropped where the infantry needed them most. He immediately asked the commander for permission to find targets for bombing. They circled rapidly, looking forward. Below was the planned infantry charge path, but why had our infantry not yet landed on this narrow corridor? Upon closer observation, there were enemy scattered troops and artillery positions here. He ordered the navigator: "Aim well, and drop the bombs here!" Heavy bombs exploded and bloomed in the enemy-held artillery positions and communication trenches one after another.

The good news of Song Zongzhou's crew's victory in the air battle quickly spread to the commander, to the maintenance personnel at the airport who maintained the war eagles day and night, and throughout their unit.

People welcoming them at the airport gave bouquets of flowers to him and his comrades; people of the motherland wrote letters congratulating them.

At this first Air Force Heroic Model Meritorious Personnel Representative Conference, the Air Force leaders awarded him the title of Second-Class Combat Hero. During the days of meeting with the people of the capital, Song Zongzhou repeatedly stated: I will never forget the honor given to me by the people of the motherland. We have the confidence to liberate our territory of Taiwan together with the people of the whole country and the army and navy.

    英雄的轰炸机飞行员宋宗周
    许庚泉
    一九五五年一月十日夜，暴风在浙江东海面上狂啸着，海水被掀起滚滚的浪花。在大陈港湾的海底，这一天，埋葬了蒋贼军舰和舰上的蒋贼军残骸。其中有一艘最大的“中字号”登陆舰，从台湾开来还不到十二小时，就冒起浓烟被汹涌的海浪吞蚀了。
    在前线空军某轰炸部队的营房里，一个高个子宽肩膀的飞行员，他为胜利兴奋得翻来覆去地睡不着，他就是带领他们全机组和张伟良机组共同炸毁这艘“中字号”登陆舰的飞行中队长宋宗周。
    一月十日，宋宗周和他的战友和往常一样去作轰炸课目演习。他和同志们的决心是，练习得使炸弹一定要在蒋贼军头上开花。这天上午，他们演习时投下的炸弹，又都中在靶标上。他们心里正在高兴，突然接到了指挥员的命令：“挂好炸弹，作好到大陈港轰炸蒋贼军舰的战斗准备。”
    整个机场被忙碌和喜悦的景象掩盖住了。有的忙着加油，有的忙着挂弹。红旗竖起，载着重磅炸弹的战鹰摆着威武的队形凌空升起了。强大的歼击机群在高空掩护着。轰炸机群在带队长机张伟良带领下向大陈港上空飞去。
    这天，海风很大。宋宗周机组的领航长严树森聚精会神地在修正航向，宋宗周沉着地按着严树森“向左”“向右”的请求，使飞机不偏不倚地飞行着。祖国的海洋和沿海敌占岛屿的每个地方，他们都十分熟悉。他们的决心是：决不允许一艘敌舰从瞄准具里溜掉。
    搜索开始了。宋宗周盯住前下方，严树森的眼睛紧贴着瞄准具。突然，他们发现前下方有黑色斑点。这时，带队长机由无线电下达了命令：“注意搜索，准备轰炸！”“左下方有敌舰，抓大的炸！”宋宗周和严树森按着带队长机指示的方向飞去。宋宗周的声音响遍全机：“要沉着瞄准，注意警戒！”“检查一次角度！”“再检查一次角度！”后座舱里面的通讯长和射击长呼应着。就在通讯长兴奋地报告带队长机炸中敌舰的喜讯时，严树森紧跟着连喊两声“投下炸弹！”刹时间，一颗颗重磅炸弹闪电般地冲破大气层，向蒋贼军舰冲击，通讯长在后舱看得非常真切，他扯起喉咙不停地喊：“炸中了！起火了！”这时，机身轻便多了。当他们盘旋返航途中，往下看，团团浓烟烈火淹没了敌舰。
    过了七天，宋宗周机组又参加了轰炸一江山岛的战斗。
    一月十八日，天刚曚曚亮，宋宗周所在部队的机场上人们忙碌着。任务是要配合陆军、海军解放一江山岛，谁能不兴奋呢。宋宗周很早就率领飞行员在休息室里研究着战斗方案。宋宗周握紧拳头，高吭地对大家说：和陆军、海军联合作战，我们是第一次，我们不能有一点疏忽。我们的机组稍一出了差错，就会影响整个机群，也会影响整个战斗。”他说着就在桌子上摊开了一张一江山岛的军事地图。“我们的任务，就是要摧毁岛上东北角滩头阵地的制高点，二○三高地。在这二百五十多平方公尺的地方，有敌人的碉堡群，有土墙，也有堑壕。我们的陆军部队需要从山北面的断崖上登陆。所以，我们只能想着一件事，尽一切力量，在这里炸出陆军前进的道路。”
    指挥员发出的起飞命令传来了。
    这天，有海雾。宋宗周驾驶着战鹰在威武的联合机群中间向一江山岛飞去。到达目标上空了。在敌人射出的高射炮弹的烟朵中，宋宗周机组找到了指挥员指定的目标，他们把载着的重磅炸弹全部倾泻到二○三高地上。这时，轰炸机群，强击机群对蒋贼军阵地猛烈地轰炸、扫射开了，硝烟大火弥漫了整个一江山岛。
    空战继续进行着。
    宋宗周和他战友再次飞临一江山岛上空的时候，他们看到，二○三高地已变成了一片焦土。他们迅速地越过高地向前飞。他们看到人民海军的军舰向海滩急驶，舰上的大炮向一江山岛连续轰击着；舰上的步兵战士挥动着帽子向机群欢呼。英勇的先头部队开始登陆了。这时岛上有了我们的战友，也有了我们的据点。宋宗周和他的战友被陆、海、空军联合作战的雄伟阵容激动着。他思索，应该把炸弹迅速地投到我步兵最需要的地方去。他随即请示指挥员允许他们机动寻找目标轰炸。他们急速地盘旋着，往前看，下面就是预定的步兵冲锋道路，但是为什么我们的步兵还没有登上这条狭长走廊？仔细观察，这里有敌人散兵群和炮兵阵地。他命令领航长：“瞄准好，把炸弹投在这里！”重磅炸弹一颗接着一颗在敌人据守的炮兵阵地和交通沟里爆炸、开花了。
    宋宗周机组空战胜利的喜讯，迅速地传到指挥员那里，传到机场上日日夜夜维护战鹰的机务人员那里，传遍了他们部队。
    机场上欢迎的人们把一束束鲜花送到他和战友们的手里；祖国的人们写信祝贺他们。
    在这次空军首届英雄模范功臣代表大会上，空军首长授予他二级战斗英雄称号。宋宗周在和首都人民会见的日子里，他一再表示：我永远不能忘记祖国人民给予我的荣誉，我们有信心和全国人民和陆军、海军一起，解放我国领土台湾。
