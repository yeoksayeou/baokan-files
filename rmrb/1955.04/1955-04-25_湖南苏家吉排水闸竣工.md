Hunan Sujiaji Drainage Sluice Completed

The largest drainage sluice in Hunan Province, the Sujiaji Sluice, was successfully completed on April 15th, half a month ahead of schedule. The Sujiaji Sluice is located on the north bank of the Yuan River floodway in West Dongting Lake. It has five openings with a net width of 50 meters. Including the traffic bridges and gate piers at both ends, it is 110 meters wide and 11 meters high. The gate is made of steel and is arc-shaped, and the opening and closing are controlled by an electric-manual dual-purpose hoist. The entire structure is made of reinforced concrete. The completion of this sluice can drain the accumulated water from the Chongtian Lake flood storage and reclamation area, saving more than 470,000 mu of fertile land from flooding. It can also increase the cultivated area by 45,000 mu, protecting the agricultural production of more than 200,000 farmers in the Chongtian Lake area from floods.

On April 17th, a grand completion ceremony was held at the construction site, and the sluice was officially opened for water discharge. (Hu Qinghua)

    湖南苏家吉排水闸竣工
    湖南省最大的排水闸——苏家吉水闸，已于四月十五日提前半个月胜利竣工。苏家吉水闸建立在西洞庭湖沅水洪道的北岸，共有五个孔，净宽五十公尺，连两端的交通桥和闸墩等在内，就有一百一十公尺宽，闸高十一公尺，闸门是钢质弧形的，启闭用电动手摇两用启闭机操纵。全部建筑都是用钢筋混凝土制成的。这一水闸的建成，可以排出冲天湖蓄洪垦区的渍水，使四十七万多亩良田免遭水灾，并可增加耕地面积四万五千亩，使冲天湖区二十多万农民的农业生产免受洪水的侵袭。
    四月十七日，建闸工地举行了隆重的竣工典礼，并正式开闸放水。　（胡清华）
