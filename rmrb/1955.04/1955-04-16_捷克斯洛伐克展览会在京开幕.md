Xinhua News Agency, April 15th. The Exhibition of Achievements in Ten Years of Socialist Construction in Czechoslovakia opened at the Soviet Exhibition Center in Beijing on the afternoon of the 15th.

The opening ceremony was held in the square in front of the central hall of the Soviet Exhibition Center.

The national flags of China and Czechoslovakia were hung at the entrance to the square.

As the opening ceremony began, the band played the national anthems of Czechoslovakia and China.

The opening ceremony was presided over by the Czechoslovak Ambassador to China, Mr. Gregor, who delivered the opening speech. He said: This exhibition is a grand review of the achievements made by our people in socialist construction through their own creative and hard work. We hope that this exhibition will bring our country and people closer to the Chinese people, will help to further deepen the fraternal cooperation between China and Czechoslovakia, and will help to further consolidate the friendly relations between the two countries.

He further pointed out that the economic cooperation between Czechoslovakia and China in the past five years has reached such a level that without such cooperation, Czechoslovakia could not have achieved such great achievements in socialist construction. Therefore, this exhibition also indirectly shows the great achievements made by the Chinese people in building their own country, which makes us feel happy and encouraged. This exhibition is our common creation, the crystallization of Czechoslovak-Chinese friendship and mutual assistance. Finally, he expressed his heartfelt thanks to all the leading staff of the People's Republic of China and all Chinese friends who participated in the preparation of this exhibition.

Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, then delivered a congratulatory speech. He said that this exhibition is large in scale and rich in content, with a total of more than 4,000 boxes of exhibits, weighing more than 1,800 tons, covering an area of 16,000 square meters, including various industrial machines, agricultural machines, light industrial products, agricultural products, and cultural and artistic works. During the exhibition, there will be screenings of various Czechoslovak scientific documentaries, performances by Czechoslovak special-purpose aircraft, and performances by the famous Czechoslovak Liberec Puppet Theater in the capital. In addition, Czechoslovak industrial products and exquisite daily necessities will also be sold in many sales outlets in the exhibition hall. The Chinese people warmly welcome this grand exhibition.

He also said that this exhibition vividly presents the remarkable achievements of Czechoslovakia in socialist construction over the past ten years since its liberation to the Chinese people. It will further strengthen the economic and cultural cooperation between China and Czechoslovakia, and will enable the Chinese people to further understand the achievements of the Czechoslovak Republic in socialist construction, and learn from the socialist construction experience of the Czechoslovak people, so that the people of China and Czechoslovakia can advance together on the road of socialist construction. He said that this will help to consolidate and develop the friendship between the peoples of China and Czechoslovakia and strengthen the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union.

At the opening ceremony, the head of the Czechoslovak government delegation, Czechoslovak Deputy Prime Minister Jankovcova, and the Deputy Prime Minister of the People's Republic of China, Li Xiannian, delivered speeches successively (see page 3 of today's newspaper).
