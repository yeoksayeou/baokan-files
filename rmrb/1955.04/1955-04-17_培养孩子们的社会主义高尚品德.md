Cultivating Socialist Noble Morals in Children
    Cai Jianyuan

    "Mom, look! A piece of steamed bun, I had left over from school. Just give me two hundred yuan (old currency, same below) to buy a fried dough stick for tomorrow's breakfast," my daughter Weimin said excitedly to her mother as soon as she came back from school and put down her schoolbag. Weimin is in the fourth grade of elementary school. She has lunch and dinner at school, and her mother gives her 500 yuan every day to buy breakfast. At this time, the mother replied in a serious tone, "It is wrong to do this. How could this be allowed to develop into such petty greed!" Weimin burst into tears, knowing she was wrong. So she immediately returned the steamed bun to the school kitchen.

    This mother is called Zhang Binru. She is a teacher at the First Central Elementary School in the eastern suburbs of Beijing. In her educational work, she strives to teach her students' lessons and cultivate their moral character, just like treating her own children. She was selected by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Education Bureau as an outstanding education worker in 1954. Nineteen primary and secondary school teachers in the city received special awards, and she was one of them.

    Every morning, when students come to school with their schoolbags, Zhang Binru cannot help but think of her responsibility: the children will be the builders of socialism, and she must educate them to be people with both culture and good character. But she felt that it was easier to teach culture, but it took more effort to cultivate children's noble character. Morality is expressed in many ways and requires long-term and patient cultivation. How to cultivate it? Her method is to first strictly demand herself, set an example, and influence students. For example, to cultivate children's habit of keeping the collective clean, she personally picks up a piece of paper when she sees it thrown on the ground; to cultivate children's moral character of cherishing public property, she starts with small things like straightening a crooked table. Her reason is: children are not yet fixed and are best at imitating.

    Once, a student broke a piece of glass in the classroom window. Zhang Binru talked to him about this matter, and other students were also listening. Suddenly the child said, "Can't I just pay for it?" Zhang Binru immediately said to the children that paying for it was right, but more importantly, they should realize that the glass was made by the worker uncles, and it was not easy to make a piece of glass; and our country is under construction, building many factories and schools, and needs a lot of glass, wouldn't it be less if one piece is broken? The child had nothing more to say, and he understood why he should not damage public property. Not long ago, Zhang Binru should have returned 400 yuan to a student for buying something, but she only had 300 yuan on hand at the time. At this time, another student sent 100 yuan he had found. A group of students watched, and one of them said, "Teacher Zhang, this is just enough to make up for it!" Zhang Binru immediately explained to the children that it could not be "made up for," and the money found should be handed over to the teacher on duty for announcement; she would bring the money she was missing.

    Zhang Binru especially values cultivating children's honest attitude. She believes that honesty is one of the most important contents of socialist morality. Once, student Wei Xuerong took her vocabulary book and said that she didn't know why the words she had written correctly had all changed incorrectly. Zhang Binru also found it strange: those words had been specially explained, and she believed that Wei Xuerong would not write them wrong, it must have been another child who deliberately changed them. Who was it? Soon, she knew that the problem was with Shui Hanwei. Shui Hanwei had a small disagreement with Wei Xuerong, and did this immoral thing out of revenge and jealousy. Zhang Binru and other teachers studied how to deal with this matter. In class, Zhang Binru first checked with the children the responsibilities she should bear, and then analyzed the nature of the matter to the children. Finally, she said: "I am very sad that this bad thing happened today. The many stories I usually tell everyone are to encourage everyone to be honest. Who did this? Think about it, if you do something wrong, you must bravely admit it." She also specially told the story of how Lenin bravely admitted his mistake when he broke his aunt's beloved vase when he was a child, so that the children all wanted to be honest people. After class, Shui Hanwei came and cried, "Teacher Zhang, I did that." Zhang Binru comforted her and said, "It's good to be able to admit your mistake. Now that you realize that what you did was wrong, it will be good if you don't do it again in the future." The next day, Shui Hanwei wrote another letter to Zhang Binru, expressing that she would never do it again.

    The class led by Zhang Binru has particularly good classroom order. Some teachers joked that this class has no "special children." But there used to be "special children." Zhang Binru often thought that to help "special children" improve, children should first feel that the teacher is the closest person to them, make the children feel warm, and be able to listen to the teacher's advice. The eleven-year-old male student Liu Zeng was very smart, but he used to quarrel and fight with his classmates and was impolite to the teacher. In order to help this "special child," Zhang Binru often contacted his family, asked his mother and father about his situation at home, and patiently analyzed what he had done to him again and again. Once, this child was sick, but he still came to class. Zhang Binru persuaded him to go home to rest. Afterwards, she wrote a letter to comfort him and asked other students to visit him. Zhang Binru knew that he especially liked to watch movies. Once there was an opportunity to watch a movie collectively, and at this time Liu Zeng's health was about to recover, so Zhang Binru specially reserved a ticket for him. This child felt the teacher's care and concern for him, and gradually listened to the teacher's teachings, quarreled less with his classmates, and fought less. When it was almost time for the winter vacation in 1954, the child fell ill again. While he was sick, he often thought of the story of the hero Huang Jiguang that Zhang Binru usually told. He said, "Huang Jiguang is so good, why am I not good?" When he returned to school again, he had indeed changed. Now this "special child" wears a red scarf.

    Zhang Binru believes that teachers should truly love children and care for children, and provide more help to children with special difficulties. She herself does this. Student He Jinzhong is an eleven-year-old boy. His mother died early, leaving only his father who made a living driving a cart. His father was often away from home for several days, and the child rarely received care. Zhang Binru found that He Jinzhong was very unclean, so she thought she must go and see how this child lived at home. One noon, Zhang Binru went to the child's house and saw that things were placed in a mess, so she taught the child how to tidy up. There was a coal stove without a chimney burning in the room, so she helped the child carry it to the yard and told an old lady in the same yard that she hoped she could take more care of the child. Later, she found that the child always wore a single coat and rarely washed it. Zhang Binru told the child to wash it himself every other day, and take it to her house in a few days, and she would wash it thoroughly. The child did as she said. Zhang Binru also sewed on the lost buttons for the child.

    Zhang Binru cares for her students with a mother's heart. Under her education, a significant effect is that children have the habit of physical labor. Children no longer use "Mom is busy" as an excuse to leave their towels and masks dirty. Children can wash it themselves.

    Zhang Binru does not relax at all even for students who are particularly good at studying. Zhang Xuchun is a good student who gets five points in every subject every semester. One day during a break, this child said to Zhang Binru triumphantly, "My mother prepares delicious food for me every day." It turned out that because he was the only son, his mother loved him especially, unlike his older sisters. Zhang Binru immediately told the child that his body was fine and should not be treated so specially, and asked him to take the initiative to ask his mother to eat what everyone else ate. The child went back and told his mother. When Zhang Binru met his mother, she explained the reasons in detail, and finally made his mother correct this shortcoming. This is a small matter in life, but it is related to the growth and development of the child's thinking and morality.

    "The teacher's world view, his conduct, his life, and his attitude towards every phenomenon all affect all students in one way or another. ... Therefore, a teacher must also examine himself carefully. He should feel that his every move is under the strictest supervision, and no one in the world is under such strict supervision." (Kalinin) Zhang Binru said that she felt these few words the most deeply.

    培养孩子们的社会主义高尚品德
    蔡鉴远
    “妈妈，你看！一块馒头，我在学校吃剩的。明天的早点，你只给我二百元（旧币，下同）买根油条就行了。”女儿伟民从学校回来，一放下书包就兴奋地向母亲说。伟民在小学四年级念书，中饭和晚饭在学校入伙，早点每天由母亲给五百元现买。这时母亲用严肃的态度回答说：“这样做是不对的。这样贪小便宜，发展下去怎么得了呢！”伟民哭起来，她知道自己错了。于是她立即把那一块馒头送还学校的厨房。
    这位母亲叫张彬儒。她是北京市东郊区第一中心小学校的教师。她在自己的教育工作岗位上，也像对待自己的儿女一样，在努力教功课的同时，也努力培养学生们的道德品质。她是北京市人民政府教育局评选出来的一九五四年度的优秀教育工作者。全市中小学教师有十九个得到特等奖，她是其中的一个。
    每天早晨，当学生们提着书包来到学校，张彬儒就不由地想到自己的责任：孩子们将是社会主义的建设者，自己必须把孩子们教育成文化和品德都很好的人。可是她觉得，教好文化比较容易，要培养孩子们的高尚品德，却要费更多心思。品德表现在多方面，而且需要长期耐心地培养。怎样培养呢？她的办法是首先严格要求自己，以身作则，影响学生。比如要培养孩子们保持集体清洁的习惯，那末当她看到地上扔了一片纸，她就亲自把它拾起来；培养孩子们爱护公物的品德，她就从扶正歪了的桌子之类的小事开始。她的理由是：孩子们是不定型的，最善于模仿。
      一次，一个学生打坏了教室窗子上的一块玻璃。张彬儒和他谈这件事情，别的学生也在一旁听。突然那孩子说：“我赔还不成吗？”张彬儒立即对孩子们说，赔是应该的，可是更重要的是要认识到玻璃是工人叔叔造的，造一块玻璃并不容易；而且我们国家正在建设，正在盖许多工厂和学校，需要很多玻璃，打坏了一块，不就少了一块吗？那个孩子再没有话说，他懂得了为什么不应该损害公物的道理。不久以前，为买一件东西，张彬儒应该找还一学生四百元，但她手边当时只有三百元。这时另一个学生送来拾到的一百元。一群学生围着看，当中一个孩子说：“张老师，这正巧补上啦！”张彬儒立即对孩子们说明不能“补上”，拾到的钱应
  该交由值日教师招领，她缺的钱她会拿来的。
      张彬儒特别重视培养孩子们的诚实态度。她认
  为诚实是社会主义道德品质中最重要的内容之一。
  一次，学生魏秀荣拿着生字本来说，不知为什么她
  写对的字都变错了。张彬儒也觉得奇怪：那些字都
  是特别讲了的，相信魏秀荣不会写错，一定是别的
  孩子故意给改了。是谁呢？不久，她知道毛病出在水汉伟身上。水汉伟和魏秀荣闹了小意见，由于报复的动机和嫉妒的心理而做了这件不道德的事。张彬儒和别的教师们研究了如何处理这件事的办法。上课了，张彬儒先向孩子们检查了自己应该负的责任，然后向孩子们分析了这件事的性质。最后她说：“今天发生了这件不好的事，我很难过。平常给大家讲的许多故事，就是要大家诚实。是谁做的这件事呢？想一想，做错了就要勇敢承认。”她还特别讲了列宁小时候打坏了姑母心爱的花瓶时勇敢认错的故事，使孩子们都一心要做诚实的人。下课以后，水汉伟来了，哭着说：“张老师，那件事是我做的。”张彬儒安慰了她，说：“能够承认错误就是好孩子。你现在认识到那件事不对了，以后不再犯就好了。”第二天，水汉伟又给张彬儒写了信，表示以后决不再犯。
    张彬儒领导的班级，课堂秩序特别好，有的教师开玩笑说，这一班没有“特殊儿童”。但过去是有“特殊儿童”的。张彬儒常想，要帮助“特殊儿童”长进，应该使孩子首先感到教师是最亲近的人，使孩子们感到温暖，能够听信教师的劝导。十一岁的男学生柳增，很聪明，可是过去常和同学吵嘴、打架，对教师没礼貌。张彬儒为了帮助这个“特殊儿童”，便常和他的家庭联系，找他的母亲和父亲了解他在家里的情况，并且一次又一次地耐心给他分析他作的事情。一次，这个孩子病了，但他还来上课。张彬儒就劝他回家休息。过后又写信安慰他，托别的学生去看他。张彬儒知道他特别喜欢看电影，一次有了一个集体看电影的机会，而这时柳增的身体也快要恢复健康了，张彬儒就特地为他留了票。这孩子感到教师对他的体贴、关怀，渐渐地听从教师的教导，和同学们吵得少了，打得少了。一九五四年快放寒假的时候，这孩子又病了，在病中，他时常想起张彬儒平日讲的英雄黄继光的故事，他说：“黄继光多好，我为什么不好呢？”当他再回到学校时，果然变了。现在这个“特殊儿童”带上了红领巾。
    张彬儒认为，教师应该切实热爱孩子、关心孩子，对有特别困难的孩子，更要给以多方面的帮助。她自己就是这样做的。学生何金忠是一个十一岁的男孩子。他母亲早死了，只剩下赶大车为生的父亲。父亲常常几天不回家，孩子很少受到照顾。张彬儒发现何金忠很不清洁，她就想必须去看看这孩子在家里是怎么生活的。一天中午，张彬儒到这孩子家里去，看到东西放得很乱，她就教给孩子应当怎么收拾。屋里正烧着一个没烟筒的煤炉子，她就帮着孩子抬到院里，并且告诉同院的一位老太太，希望能多照顾这孩子。后来又发觉这孩子老穿一件单衣，很少洗换。张彬儒告诉孩子，要他每隔两天自己小洗一次，过几天拿到她家，她给大洗一次。孩子照着做了。张彬儒给孩子把丢掉的钮扣也钉上。
    张彬儒就是这样用母亲的心关怀着她的学生们。在她这样的教育下，一个显著的效果是：孩子们有了体力劳动的习惯。孩子们不再用“妈妈没空”为理由，而任手巾脏、口罩脏了。孩子们自己可以洗了。
    张彬儒对学习特别好的学生也丝毫不放松。张绪春是每一学期每一门功课都得五分的好学生。一天休息的时候，这孩子得意洋洋地对张彬儒说：“我妈妈每天都给我准备好吃的。”原来因为他是独子，母亲特别疼他，不同于对他的姐姐妹妹。张彬儒立即告诉孩子说，自己身体好好的，不应该这样特殊，要他主动向母亲提出大家吃什么，他也吃什么。这孩子回去果然向母亲说了。张彬儒见到他母亲时又详细说明了理由，终于使他母亲改正了这一缺点。这是生活小事，可是它却关系着孩子的思想和品德的成长和发展。
      “教师的世界观，他的品行，他的生活，他对每一现象的态度都这样或那样地影响着全体学生。……所以一个教师也必须好好检点自己，他应该感到，他的一举一动都处在最严格的监督之下，世界上任何人也没有受着这样严格的监督。”（加里宁）张彬儒说，她对这几句话感受最深。
