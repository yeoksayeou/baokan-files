The So-Called "Preparedness Ensures No Regrets"
Kong Sang

Some time ago, many textile enterprises, when inspecting the supply of raw materials, discovered that the phenomenon of material stockpiling in many factories was very serious. A factory in the Northwest stored fourteen main materials, generally enough for one to twelve years of use, with some enough for twenty-five years. A factory in East China had a stockpile of steel travelers sufficient for forty-four years.

A major reason for the stockpiling of materials is that some comrades believe that a large reserve of materials can regulate shortages and surpluses and ensure "timely" supply. If the "foundation" is not solid, what will happen in case of "emergency"? Therefore, under the pretext of "preparedness ensures no regrets," they conduct excessive stockpiling. For example, in the Shanghai State-owned No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, among 1,086 kinds of materials, 572 exceeded the maximum reserve. Among them, the heddle wires, even after deducting the maximum reserve, were still sufficient for more than a year and a half of use. Some factories even had materials in stock exceeding the reserve quota by as much as ten times.

In order to ensure the normal progress of production and to avoid the phenomenon of work stoppages due to lack of materials, it is necessary for each factory to appropriately reserve materials according to the characteristics of production. However, it is not permissible to exceed the reasonable limit and store materials without restriction. Because if too much is stockpiled, the state's funds will be tied up for a long time, and the enterprise's capital turnover plan will not be completed. Moreover, if too many materials are stockpiled for a long time, they will be damaged or deteriorated due to poor storage. At the same time, if some important materials are stockpiled excessively by some factories, it may cause supply difficulties for other factories.

Reducing capital tied up is an important aspect of practicing economy. In recent years, the funds saved by state-owned textile enterprises can be used to build more than two large-scale textile factories. If the factories can strive to overcome the phenomenon of material stockpiling, the saved funds will be even greater. From December of last year to February of this year, many state-owned cotton textile factories in Shanghai have already cleared out stockpiled materials worth 2.5 million yuan and have gradually put them into production. All units that have stockpiled too much material should strive to clear out the stockpiled materials, further strengthen capital management, and let the state's precious funds be used in more important construction projects!

    所谓“有备无患”
    孔桑
    前些时候，许多纺织企业检查原材料的供应工作时，发现不少工厂材料积压的现象很严重。西北一个工厂储存的十四种主要材料，一般可用一年到十二年，有几种还可以用二十五年。华东有一个厂积压的钢丝圈可以用四十四年。
    积压材料的一个主要原因，就是有些同志认为大量储备材料可以调剂有无，可以保证“及时”供应，如果“家底”不厚，“万一”需要时怎么办呢？所以在“有备无患”的借口下，进行超额的储备。如上海国营第二棉纺织厂在一千零八十六种物料中，超过最高储备量的就有五百七十二种，其中停经片一项，减除它的最高储备量后，还可以用一年半以上。有的厂库存的材料，还有超过储备定额高达十几倍的。
    为了保证生产的正常进行，为了避免发生停工待料现象，每一个工厂根据生产的特点，适当地储备材料是必要的。但是，要是超过合理的限度，而无限制地储存的话，那是不能允许的。因为储备得太多了，国家的资金被长期积压，企业的资金周转计划完不成；况且，材料积压多了，久了，还会因保管不善而损坏、变质；同时，有些重要的材料被某些厂积压过多，可能造成另一些厂供应上的困难。
    减少资金积压是厉行节约的一个重要方面。几年来，国营纺织企业节约的资金，可以用来建设两个以上大型的纺织工厂。如果各厂能努力克服材料的积压现象，那么节约的资金就会更多。上海许多国营棉纺织厂，从去年十二月到今年二月，已经清理出了价值二百五十万元的积压物资并陆续投入生产。所有积压了过多材料的单位，都应努力清理积压的材料，进一步加强资金管理工作，让国家宝贵的资金用在更重要的建设工程中去吧！
