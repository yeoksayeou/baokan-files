Workers in Yunnan and Other Places Greet "May Day" with New Production Achievements

    (Our report) Kunming – Workers and staff of various factories and mines under the Yunnan Tin Corporation and workers and staff of the basic construction departments of Gejiu City have launched a labor emulation drive to greet the "May Day" holiday. Workers of the Third District of the Malage Tin Mine held a meeting of worker representatives of the entire district on April 19, deciding to further develop the labor emulation drive and complete the April production plan ahead of schedule. Workers of the Yunxi Machine Factory are actively improving tools to support production and basic construction, and improve production efficiency. After mechanic Shang Lusheng improved the tool for threading screws, production efficiency increased by more than double. After planer Jin Guo improved the tool, the production efficiency of the oil cup cover increased tenfold compared to before. Workers of the pipeline group of a certain thermal power plant expansion project of Yunxi, in the work of processing furnace tubes, created the "model bending method," which increased production efficiency by double. When workers in the boiler group grinded tube holes, they switched to electric drills, which increased work efficiency by fifteen times compared to before. Tang Fushan's bricklaying team in the Yunnan Engineering Office has widely promoted the "parallel assembly line method" and the "double-handed mud squeezing method." Since April 9, each person has averaged 3,490 bricks per day, greatly exceeding the quota.
    (Our report) Nanjing, April 25 – Workers of the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory of the Ministry of Railways are enthusiastically carrying out a labor emulation drive to greet the "May Day" International Labor Day with new production achievements.
    When producing eccentric cranks, mechanic Zhou Fulin in the mechanical workshop operated with the five newly improved clamps together, creating a new record of completing 35 hours of work in 8 hours and 30 minutes. When Shen Caiyou and Liu Ximing of the large lathe group were machining the axle box sliding bearing seat, they switched to high-speed cutting, increasing efficiency by 51%. They also learned Zhuang Minggeng's advanced segmented operation, increasing efficiency by 53% when producing eccentric cranks. Female mechanic Deng Darlin completed 43 hours of work in 28 hours when machining water meter steam valves. Mechanic Zhuang Minggeng, who won the "Glorious Railway Worker" medal, processed converter plugs with an average time of 57 minutes, breaking the original competition target of one and a half hours.
