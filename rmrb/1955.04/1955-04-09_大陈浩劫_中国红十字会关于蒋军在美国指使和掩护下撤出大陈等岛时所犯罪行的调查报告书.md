The Great Chen Catastrophe
—Investigation Report by the Chinese Red Cross on the Crimes Committed by the Chiang Kai-shek Troops, Under the Direction and Cover of the United States, When Withdrawing from Dachen and Other Islands

(II) Brutal Crimes Beyond Abduction

In addition to forcibly removing more than 20,000 residents from Dachen and other islands from their homes, American and Chiang Kai-shek troops also set fire to the shops and houses built by these residents with a lifetime of hard work. The shops, houses, and other properties that were not burned were also subjected to frantic looting and destruction, causing the residents to lose the means of production and the fruits of their labor on which they had depended for generations, leaving them with no way to make a living and no home to return to.

(A) Burning and Destruction

The investigation team conducted a detailed investigation on Dachen, Yushan, Pishan, and Nanji islands regarding the burning and destruction of local residents' homes by the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek troops.

The investigation team found that the houses of residents in twenty villages and towns on Dachen Island were burned down. These villages and towns are: Dongkeng, Dashatou, Xijitou, Nankeng Street, Nantian, Zhuniukeng, Shanpanling, Xiangdou Ao Li, Xiao Ao Li, Guandi Ao, Da Ao Li, Nankan, Guding Li, Dantou, Qianshan, Xiaobantian, Dabantian, Dongshantou, Zhongzui, Xiangdou Ao. Among them, the houses in Dongkeng, Shanpanling, Xiangdou Ao, Xiao Ao Li, Guandi Ao and other villages have been completely burned down, and everywhere is a ruin. It is now impossible to distinguish the original appearance of these houses, and it is difficult to find a complete piece of furniture or item.

With the help of Lin Ziqing, who used to work as a bathhouse attendant in Nankeng Street, Lower Dachen, the investigation team learned that a total of 52 houses, numbered 1 to 22 on Nankeng Street, had been completely burned down. The owners of these houses included Lin Duanyun, a grocery store owner who had lived on Dachen Island for generations, Du Yanxuan, an old farmer who made a living by growing vegetables, and Chen Shoujun, who ran a teahouse, totaling 33 households. Everything was burned to ashes on this continuous field of rubble, and even the large stone slabs used as the foundation of the houses were cracked by the fire. At the entrance of Nankeng Street, the investigation team found three U.S. military gasoline drums placed between two ruins about ten meters apart.

Near Dashatou, there were originally 32 households, and their houses have been completely burned down. On the ruins of the house of fisherman Ye Xiaonong, a new fishing net that had not been oiled was burned into a pile of white ash. Lin Mingyao, a resident familiar with the area, said: "Ye Xiaonong's house was left to him by his father, and he cherished the house very much, repairing it immediately when he found a hole. How sad he would be if he knew that the house had been burned down." On this ruin, there was a straw hut where Jiang Wenzheng, a small sugar vendor, and his family of four lived. Now, only the shovel, knife, pot, and mold used by the owner to make sugar are left.

The villages on Nanji Island suffered the same destruction. Among them, six villages were almost completely burned down, with a total of 165 houses burned. These villages are:

Waihuogunning Ao: originally 61 houses, 60 burned down.
Dashao Ao: originally 32 houses, 31 burned down.
Mazu Ao: originally 41 houses, 37 burned down.
Datiedong: originally 18 houses, 17 burned down.
Erlong: originally 15 houses, all burned down.
Shangbaimuping: originally 12 houses, 5 burned down.

On the ruins of these villages, the stones were charred black, and the earthen walls were burned red. On the ruins, the investigation team saw a lot of ashes of fishing nets and burned magnetic net sinkers, iron anchors, hoes, sickles, iron rakes, iron shovels, saw blades, chisels... The small amount of grain stored by the residents in jars was burned black, and many bowls, basins, and jars were all burned and cracked. On the ruins of Mazu Ao, a stone mortar about two feet high was broken by the fire, and next to the stone mortar was a stone hammer with a burned handle, which was a tool used by the residents to pound rice. Nearby, there was also a sheep that had been burned to death.

According to Qian Xingming, a fisherman now living in Aojiang Town, Pingyang County, Zhejiang Province, he originally had four houses left by his grandfather in Dashao Ao, Nanji Island. When Qian Xingming fled Nanji Island in June 1952, he handed the houses over to his father-in-law, Kong Xianghao, to manage. Now that Kong Xianghao has been abducted by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, Qian Xingming's four houses, one of which was demolished by the Chiang Kai-shek troops when they built a playground in the past, and the other three houses and furniture, were all burned down this time. Next to these burned houses, there are gasoline drums painted with U.S. military logos.

On Pishan Island, the Chiang Kai-shek troops burned and blew up a total of 41 houses in the three villages of Zhong Ao, Nantou Mountain, and Shangkanmen. Wang Sihan, who originally lived on Pishan Island, complained to the investigation team about the Chiang Kai-shek troops' crimes of destroying his houses and killing his relatives. Wang Sihan now runs the Liantaihe Hotel in Kanmen Town, Yuhuan County. He had a building in his old home in Pishan. This building was forcibly occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek troops in 1950, and the whole family was driven to live in a shed. His third younger brother, Wang Sicao, was killed for resisting the Chiang Kai-shek troops' oppression; his second younger brother, Wang Siqing, was captured by the Chiang Kai-shek troops and forced to work as a coolie in Lower Dachen, and his whereabouts are now unknown. After Pishan was liberated, Wang Sihan returned to Pishan and saw that his building had been blown up: the five main rooms in the middle had become rubble, with craters from the explosives below, and the roofs of the two rooms next to it had also collapsed. Wang Sihan burst into tears at this tragic scene. He said: "Chiang Kai-shek has ruined my family."

The investigation team paid special attention to the fact that near the ruins of houses burned on each island, there was always one or several gasoline drums, and these gasoline drums were labeled: "From USA for Mutual Defense".

Before the Chiang Kai-shek troops withdrew, there were about 300 fishing boats and merchant ships on Dachen, Yushan, Pishan, Nanji and other islands. The fishing boats and merchant ships on which these hardworking residents depended for their livelihood were either robbed by the Chiang Kai-shek troops during their withdrawal or destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. The investigation team did not see a single complete merchant ship or fishing boat on the above-mentioned islands.

On the beach near Dashatou in Lower Dachen, there were dozens of damaged fishing boats. Among them, many fishing boats have been smashed into pieces of wood and are scattered on the beach or floating in the bay. There are also some shaped ships that have been overturned on the beach, and each ship has a large hole in the bottom, which shows that it was smashed open with heavy objects.

In Dashao Ao, Houlong, and Huogunning Ao in Nanji Island, 42 fishing boats and merchant ships were destroyed. On the beach of Huogunning Ao, there were four relatively large fishing boats and merchant ships that had been destroyed. One of them was loaded with brown sugar, and the other was loaded with raincoats. In the middle cabin of the ship loaded with raincoats, there was a package of American yellow explosives packed with detonators and fuses that had not exploded, and two very long fuses were still hanging on one side of the ship. About one meter away from this ship, the investigation team found two more unexploded yellow explosives.

All of the original 40-plus fishing boats on Pishan Island have been destroyed. At Nantou Pier, two large fishing boats were sunk in the sea by the Chiang Kai-shek troops.

In the harbors such as Nankeng Street in Lower Dachen, the investigation team saw temporary piers made of fishing boats and merchant ships used by the Chiang Kai-shek troops to abduct residents. Some ships were already half-submerged in the water, and some ships were still connected in groups of three or five with iron chains, with door panels, bed boards, counter boards, and even coffin boards laid haphazardly on top. Victims Su Binglin and Lin Mingyao complained that the Chiang Kai-shek troops forcibly pulled 120 fishing boats and merchant ships from the residents before they withdrew to make four temporary piers, and finally blew up these ships.

The investigation team also saw a large number of fishing boats pulled from the sea to the hillside in Lower Dachen. On the hillside in Nankeng Village, Lower Dachen, in front of Chiang Kai-shek's Wenling County Police Station, there were seven such fishing boats. These fishing boats have all been destroyed. One boat had eleven large and small holes smashed in it, and the other fishing boats had at least five or six holes smashed in them. Wang Qichang said that these fishing boats were all ordered by the Chiang Kai-shek troops to be pulled up the mountain by the fishermen before they withdrew. On the midnight of January 23, the Chiang Kai-shek troops forced the fishermen of Huangfu Reef to row all their fishing boats to Langtongmen and pull them up the mountain. That night, he was also forced to row his fishing boat there. The investigation team followed Wang Qichang to Langtongmen and saw a total of twenty-seven fishing boats of various sizes from the beach all the way to the hillside. Some boats were stacked on top of each other, some boats were overturned on the weeds, and many boats had cracked seams. Almost all the sails, masts, rudders, and cabin boards of the boats were gone, and there were six remaining cabin boards and one oar stake left on the beach. Wang Qichang quickly recognized his small fishing boat among this pile of destroyed fishing boats. Only an empty shell was left of his boat. He also recognized who the owners of many fishing boats were and pointed them out to the investigation team one by one. Among them were the fishing boats of the victimized woman Wang Xianghua's family (No. 2129), and the fishing boats of the fishermen Ma Meiyu (No. 2131), Chen Sanyu (No. 2132), Zhu Xingcai (No. 2125), Zheng Siyu (No. 2126), Shen Zhengtu (No. 2128), Ma Xianji (No. 2121), and Chen Laowu (No. 2130) who were abducted by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. Wang Qichang complained to the investigation team: "Now the spring fishing season is coming, and there are many cuttlefish and yellow croaker in the Dachen Sea. If it weren't for the Kuomintang harming us like this, we would be busy fishing at sea these days!" In Daxiaopu and other places, all the fishing boats were similarly damaged. The investigation team also noted that a large number of fishing nets were also destroyed. On the more than one-mile-long road from Lower Dachen to the naval pier, fishing nets were spread intermittently, and they had been deeply trampled into the soil, with traces of car rubber tires on them.

The Chiang Kai-shek troops also destroyed public facilities and many temples on Dachen, Yushan, Pishan, and Nanji islands.

The investigation team inspected the main wells, ponds, and reservoirs in Lower Dachen that were destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, which were the common wealth painstakingly built by the residents of Dachen. The victimized resident Ye Jianlin told the investigation team that Lower Dachen was short of fresh water. During droughts, many residents lined up at the wells or ponds to fetch water before dawn. In recent years, the residents have put in a lot of labor to build more than a dozen wells and ponds, and were building a large reservoir. Now, these wells, ponds, and reservoirs have all been destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. Among them, seven wells, ponds, and a large reservoir under construction were most severely damaged. The large reservoir about to be completed was located in Boli Pit, and it was destroyed as follows: a dam about ten meters high and about twenty meters long was blasted down nearly four meters, and many tools, water pipes, steel, and wood at the construction site were also damaged. Ye Jianlin once participated in the construction of this reservoir. He said: "In order to build this reservoir, since last August, more than 50 people from Nantian Village and Nankengli and other nine villages and towns have come here to work every day." In the past six months, the local residents have put in nearly ten thousand man-days of labor here. In the rubble pile of this destroyed dam, the investigation team found the casing of an electric detonating blasting cap manufactured by Hercules Powder Company, Wilmington, Delaware. At the edge of the destroyed pool at the foot of the mountain southwest of Langtongmen, the investigation team also unearthed a bundle of 13 pounds of high-grade explosives manufactured by Trojan Powder Co. of Allentown, USA, already loaded with detonators and fuses.

On the side of the road in Nantian Village, Lower Dachen, there is a pool with an area of about six square meters. Jia Wu, a victimized resident in Xiaokengli, told the investigation team: This pool was built in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War. For more than ten years, it has been the main source of water for more than 100 households nearby. Now, the investigation team saw that the pool was filled with dirty broken military uniforms, official documents, bullets, and broken towels printed with the words "National Army" thrown by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. The well in the Dashatou Square was also filled with firewood, ammunition boxes, and dirt, and the well water had turned black and emitted an odor, and there were traces of smoke and fire blackened on the well wall.

At the foot of the south slope of Daao Mountain in Yushan Island, there is also a freshwater pool destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. This pool is about five meters long, about three meters wide, and about one and a half meters deep, with spring water flowing down from the mountain stored in the pool. Fisherman Mei A'gen said that the residents of Daao, Xiaoao, and Xinghuaao on the island all used the water in this pool. Now, the north wall of this pool has been completely blasted down, and cement blocks are scattered more than ten meters away. Near the lighthouse, there is another destroyed freshwater pool. This pool is about seven meters long, about five meters wide, and about one meter deep. According to Mei A'gen, when he was eleven years old, it did not rain for three consecutive months, and the water sources on the entire island dried up, but this pool still had water. At that time, this pool not only supplied water to the residents of the entire Yushan Island, but also supplied water to the fishermen on more than 200 fishing boats that often fished in the Yushan Island area.

The wells and water sources near Dashao Ao, Shanjiaoliao, Shangbaimuping, Datiedong and other villages on Nanji Island were also filled with gasoline and garbage by the Chiang Kai-shek troops.

When the investigation team was investigating in Nankeng Village, Lower Dachen, it inspected the site of a health center. This was the only civilian hospital on Dachen Island. Now this hospital, which is 180 square meters in size, has been burned down. The remaining three small houses had their doors and windows all smashed. Balls of gauze bandages, medicines, and medical equipment were scattered on the ground, and a bucket of newly opened Vaseline was infiltrated with rotten grass and mud.

The three main schools in Lower Dachen—Zhongzheng Middle School, Goujian Primary School, and National School—were also damaged. A wooden pillar in the classroom of Zhongzheng Middle School had been charred, several iron sheets on the walls had been knocked down, and the teaching equipment in the classroom had also been damaged. The doors and windows of Goujian Primary School were almost all broken, and two blackboards were thrown on the side of the road near the school gate and had been trampled and broken. The remaining desks had their legs broken, and the classroom was full of torn charts and textbooks.

A primary school north of Dashao Ao on Nanji Island was also burned down, leaving only stone tables and benches that could not be burned.

Many temples on Dachen Island were also blown up and destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. During the investigation, the investigation team learned that most of the residents on Dachen Island believe in Buddhism. There are a total of 30 temples on the island. Now, Guanyin Hall, Dizang Temple, and Yangfu Temple have all been blown up; one Niangniang Temple, Yushi Temple, Wuchang Temple, and Guanyin Temple, and two Land Temples, Pingshui Great Emperor Temples, and Guandi Temples have also been damaged to varying degrees. Guanyin Hall in Nankengli was blown up, and the beams, pillars, doors, and windows were intertwined and overturned. The head of the Guanyin Bodhisattva was blown up and only a wooden stake remained. Other statues of gods were also blown up with missing heads and arms. Incense burners and incense tables were gone. Lin Ziqing said that there used to be two monks in Guanyin Hall. In May 1953, the Chiang Kai-shek troops wanted to arrest these two monks to serve as soldiers. At that time, the monks were crying and chanting Amitabha. Later, the Buddhists on the island raised a sum of money to redeem the monks. Now, these two monks have also been abducted to Taiwan. Jia Wu led the investigation team to inspect the Niangniang Temple, which was most worshipped by the women of Dachen Island. This temple was occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek troops' navy as a warehouse, and a musty smell was smelled as soon as they walked in. The ground was covered with rotten military uniforms, stinky cans, and feces thrown by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. There were 13 holes punched in the roof of the main hall. The clay sculpture of the main god, Niangniang, was lying on the ground, and her left arm had been broken. The palace eaves carved with various patterns of the god's throne were also smashed. Jia Wu felt very uncomfortable when she saw this scene. She said that in previous years, this was the season for fishermen to go to sea to fish, and the mothers, wives, and daughters of the fishermen would all come to this temple to burn incense and pray to Niangniang to bless their relatives for their safety at sea. She said: "Now no one comes to burn incense, and everyone has been abducted."

When the investigation team was conducting investigations on Dachen Island, it also found that before the Chiang Kai-shek troops withdrew, they had buried many landmines in the vegetable gardens, wheat fields, near the houses, and next to the wells of residents far from the defense works. Three members of the investigation team almost stepped on an undisposed landmine in the wheat field next to the road to Langtongmen.

Chen Yukun, deputy company commander, Wu Xiangyun, platoon leader, and soldier Ying Guankui of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, conducted the investigation with the investigation team. The investigation team saw many mine pits in the vegetable gardens and wheat fields in the south, north, and west directions near the village of Xiazuitou, Lower Dachen. This village was almost surrounded by landmines, and only the section leading to the road had no mines, although there were no military facilities in this village. The investigation team also conducted a detailed investigation on a minefield northwest of Xiazuitou. This minefield was about 300 meters long and about 200 meters wide, and was set up in terraced fields, only 10 meters away from the residents' houses. Now the wheat in the fields has grown more than half a foot high, and the landmines have also been cleared by the sappers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. There are still 390 mine pits left in the wheat bushes. The distance between the mine pits is sometimes 1 to 1.5 meters, and sometimes only 50 centimeters. Some of these mine pits are round, and some are rectangular. Chen Yukun said that the round pits are for burying M14 landmines, and the rectangular pits are for burying M7 landmines.

The investigation team observed the three types of landmines dug up around this village and found that they were all manufactured in the United States. Among them, one M14 type has the words "MINE APERS. NM. M14. WITH FUZE INTEGRAL PARTS MFRA. BY LOP15-753-54" on the mine casing. Wu Xiangyun said that the M14 landmine casing is entirely made of plastic and is specially used to blow off people's lower limbs. The M3 and M7 landmines are made of iron. The words on the M3 landmine casing are: "MINE ANTI-PERSONNEL M3 LOADERS LOT KOP1—13 6—1943". It weighs seven or eight pounds and has a kill radius of about ten meters. The words on the M7 landmine casing are: "MINE M7 A2 LOP.1—11, 1—53".

Before the Chiang Kai-shek troops withdrew from Dachen Island, they also buried landmines near other villages that had not been completely burned and destroyed. Forty-three M14 landmines were buried on the playground near Zhongzheng Middle School. M14 landmines were also buried next to the "Zaixing Spring" where the residents of Shuangjiaao, Lower Dachen, drank water. Now, the landmines in these areas have been largely cleared. Chen Yukun said that they cleared a total of 7,497 landmines on the island in one week from February 13 to February 21.

B. Robbery and Plunder

The investigation team walked through the commercial area of Dashatou, Lower Dachen, and saw that all the shops, warehouses, and workshops of the residents of Dachen Island had been frantically looted. The doors and windows were gone, and the shop signs and horizontal plaques on the doors were either thrown in the gutters or hanging in the air, swaying back and forth. There were originally about 2,000 merchants in Dashatou, operating dozens of industries, including groceries, gold and silver, Guangdong goods, cloth, stationery, watches, hairdressing, sewing, tobacco and alcohol, grain, restaurants, and bathhouses. The Chiang Kai-shek troops burned down many shops and blew up some houses when they withdrew. Lin Mingyao, the owner of Yilin Photo Studio, Chen Zhengyi, the owner of Chen Da Xing Soy Sauce Shop, Zheng Kaimei, the owner of Zheng Yi Xing Chinese and Western Clothing Shop, Su Binglin, a clerk at Jian Da Business, and Lin Ziqing, a clerk at Dachen Bathhouse Tea Room, all told the investigation team about the Chiang Kai-shek troops' frantic destruction and robbery of Dachen shops. They said that this town had been constantly looted and destroyed by warlords and Japanese imperialism many years ago; but those destructions and plunder were not as cruel as this time.

The investigation team carefully investigated Xiaokang Street, where commerce was most concentrated. There were originally 57 shops here, including department stores, watch shops, photo studios, jewelry stores, engraving shops, salted goods stores, pork shops, restaurants, barbershops, shoe stores, rice stores, and soy sauce gardens, and more than 20 other industries. On the door frames of several surviving department stores and grocery stores, although you can still see half of the seals with the words "This shop is sealed by the owner", the doors and windows are gone. The inside of the store is like a garbage dump, and the smell is pungent. Glass counters and shelves have been smashed. Some cheap goods, such as earth wax, grass paper, chalk, paste, etc., were thrown all over the floor. Mixed in the pile of broken things were broken military uniforms and trousers thrown by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. Next to a shelf in a shoe store, there were more than a dozen pairs of military rubber shoes and yellow cotton shoes worn by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. In another food store, the floor was covered with canned barrels and wine bottles. Some of the opened wine bottles still had most of the wine in them, and some of the cans were only eaten a little after being opened. The investigation team picked up two American bayonets next to the canned barrels. The furniture and goods in several salted goods stores were all destroyed. The pickled fish tanks were broken, shrimp skins and salted fish were thrown all over the floor, and the large wooden barrels for loading goods were overturned, some of which were even defecated in, and some broken military uniforms and hats were thrown in. In the Songhe Tang Chinese pharmacy, all of the more than 60 drawers for storing medicine were pulled open, and many herbs were scattered on the ground. Almost all the medicine bottles in the Southeast Pharmacy were smashed. The mirror in the barbershop was smashed to pieces, the back of the swivel chair was knocked off, and the leather cushion was pierced with many holes by bayonets. The tables and stools in the restaurant were broken, the stoves were smashed, and several small pots were also smashed at the bottom. In the houses of the shop owners and clerks, the locked boxes had either their lids smashed or their backs smashed open; the drawers on the cabinets were thrown on the ground, and the papered ceilings and walls had holes poked by bayonets.

Chen Zhengyi also took the investigation team to see his own soy sauce shop. The owner told us that after he was arrested, his shop was closed. At that time, there were more than 200 bottles of soy sauce on the shelves, and there were also eleven jars of wine. The day after the Chiang Kai-shek troops withdrew, he was rescued from Yangqi Island by the Chinese People's Liberation Army and saw that the door of his shop had been smashed open, the things in the shop were gone, and the goods in the warehouse were also gone. Several account books had also been torn up; only the many slogans written by the Chiang Kai-shek troops on the wall and the feces everywhere in the courtyard remained. Zheng Kaimei's clothing shop was also looted. He said that after he was thrown into prison, there were only his 40-plus-year-old wife and three children left at home. The oldest child was only eight years old, and the youngest had just turned one year old. When he was arrested, there were many things in his home, but after he returned, the heads of three sewing machines were gone, and a new leather suitcase, two fur robes, and three cotton quilts were all gone. He said, "How could a woman take these things away with three children?" In front of the investigation team, he found two sets of cotton military uniforms and the sleeve of a leather robe that had been left in his house. He said: "These two sets of military uniforms were left by the Kuomintang after they robbed my good clothes." Then, he led the investigation team to see the slogans written by the Chiang Kai-shek troops on his house's wall. He said: "The Kuomintang robbed enough from my house, and they also scribbled these slogans on my house's wall." Zheng Kaimei cried as he said this. He said that he himself had been saving money frugally year after year, and he couldn't bear to throw away even a strip of cloth. A month ago, he and his wife were still planning how to run the shop well, but he never expected such a disaster to befall him. The victimized resident Wu Shixiao also told the investigation team that when Chiang Kai-shek's Dachen District Administrative Inspectorate ordered the residents to go to Taiwan on January 25, it stipulated that each resident's luggage should not exceed 30 kilograms, and forced the shops to sell the remaining materials cheaply. A washbasin worth more than ten Taiwan dollars was only allowed to be sold for two yuan. At that time, the Chiang Kai-shek troops began to buy cheap goods on the street. Later, the Special Commissioner's Office launched a so-called "labor army movement", forcing many shops to put up signs on their doors saying "Welcome soldiers to take goods". On January 29, the Chiang Kai-shek troops forced some shops to remove their doors to build docks. When the shops' doors were wide open, the Chiang Kai-shek troops set off a false air raid alarm, driving the shop owners and clerks to the mountains for air defense, taking the opportunity to enter the shops and rob a lot of things. The shipping station of the Dachen Defense Department of the Chiang Kai-shek troops also tricked the shops' valuable materials onto ships in the name of "consignment" for a 50-50 split, and robbed the materials of these shops.

In the fishing villages and rural areas on these islands, the investigation team also saw the tragic scene after being robbed by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. Along the way and near the villages, there were piles of wet and smelly chicken feathers, pig hair, pig intestines, as well as rice, sweet potato dried, and soybeans everywhere. The doors and windows of the houses of fishermen and farmers were all smashed open, some doors were gone, some doors were lying in the house; tables, chairs, and benches were overturned, and broken clothes, old pants, hats, shoes, and socks were dragged from inside the house to outside; locked boxes and cabinets were all destroyed, and only some cloth strips, broken clothes, scraps of paper, broken threads, buttons, and other worthless things were left inside. What was left on the ground were the Chiang Kai-shek troops' military uniforms, military shoes, belts, gun oil, and even bullets and grenades.

In many rural areas of Lower Dachen, there was no livestock raised in the pens—not a pig, a sheep, or a chicken. Wang Mengzheng, a resident who led the investigation team to investigate, said: "Before I was imprisoned by the Kuomintang, many pigs, sheep, and chickens were bought by the Kuomintang, who were preparing to withdraw, at low prices. They said that the people were not allowed to carry things over a certain weight to Taiwan. From January 27, they forced the people to slaughter all the pigs, sheep, and chickens in exchange for Taiwan dollars. The price of pork was reduced from 12 Taiwan dollars per catty to 3 Taiwan dollars per catty. The people had no choice but to slaughter these livestock with tears in their eyes. But later, the price of pork was actually reduced by the Kuomintang to 1.5 Taiwan dollars per catty." Su Binglin, Zheng Kaimei, and other victims also complained about this crime of the Chiang Kai-shek troops. The investigation team also visited the home of a farmer near Dashatou. The owner, Chen Sanmei, was rescued from Yangqi Island by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. His house was littered with pieces of broken clothes, a few unwashed broken bowls, chopsticks, and vegetable basins; four bed boards were lying on the ground, and an empty wine jar under the bed had a hole punched in it. There was nothing in the small wooden cabinet, and only a bowl of smelly bean paste was left in the pot. With tears in her eyes, Chen Sanmei complained to the investigation team: "Before the end of last year (lunar calendar), when I had not been arrested by the police station, my wife and I had ground two dou of sorghum flour and prepared to buy a catty of pork and some fish to celebrate the New Year. Who knew that I would be arrested for no reason, and my wife would be forced to go to Taiwan. Now I want to cry every time I see my house." When the investigation team asked him if he had any farm tools such as hoes and mattocks left, Chen Sanmei spread out his hands and shook his head repeatedly, saying: "No, there is nothing left."

Wang Shoujian, a fisherman from Huangfu Reef, Lower Dachen, complained to the investigation team about the Chiang Kai-shek troops' crime of robbing his fishing boat "Wulanggu", saying: "When I was imprisoned on Yangqi Island, I saw with my own eyes a Kuomintang motorized sailing boat, under the protection of an American warship, towing my 'Wulanggu' away." Wang Shoujian said that this "Wulanggu" could carry 200 dan of fish and was bought with 560 silver dollars that he had accumulated from fishing at sea for more than 40 years. The "Wulanggu" that was robbed was also loaded with more than 2,000 catties of jellyfish. These jellyfish were pickled by him and five other fishermen together.

During the investigation on Pishan, Yushan, and Nanji islands, the investigation team also found the situation of the Chiang Kai-shek troops robbing shops and residents of their property, and obtained confirmation from two diaries left by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. For example, in the diary written by a deputy squad leader, on the page of February 12, he wrote: "In recent days, we have been eating pork every day, and everyone is beaming. But it is too painful for the people, every pig is raised from small to large, and his hope is to earn more money; who knows the opposite..." In another diary written by a messenger, on the page of February 20, he wrote: "Today is Sunday. After lunch, everyone ran to Houlong to see the people moving things... Our soldiers are in a terrible mess, some are taking sweet potatoes, some are taking vegetables, hey! This taste is really hard to say. It sounds like the way we failed on the mainland. No matter what it is, they are taking it randomly, and everyone wants to get rich..." (Investigation team note: Some punctuation and words in parentheses in the diary are added by us.)

Conclusion

After conducting the above-mentioned on-site investigation, we have no choice but to point out to the people of the whole country and the people of the world with uncontrollable grief and indignation:

The actions of the American and Chiang Kai-shek troops in abducting more than 20,000 residents from Dachen and other islands is an extremely brutal and inhumane crime. Under the direction of the U.S. government and with the participation of the U.S. military, the Chiang Kai-shek troops used violent means such as strict control, armed threats, burning houses, and massive robbery to achieve their evil conspiracy. It caused the various conditions on which the residents of Dachen and other islands depended for their survival to be suddenly destroyed at the time designated by the U.S. government; it caused the normal lives of the residents of Dachen and other islands to suddenly stop at the time designated by the U.S. government; it forced the residents of Dachen and other islands to leave their ancestral homeland and the property accumulated by drops of blood and sweat with tears in their eyes; it forced the residents of Dachen and other islands to abandon their warm families with tears in their eyes, husbands losing their wives, and children losing their mothers.

The U.S. government should bear the primary responsibility for this extremely brutal and inhumane crime. If the U.S. government had not ordered the deployment of naval and air forces twice the size of the residents on these islands, if the U.S. military authorities had not mobilized a large number of transport ships to participate in the abduction operation, if the U.S. military authorities had not supplied a large amount of explosives and gasoline and dispatched demolition technicians to directly participate in the burning and destruction, the Chiang Kai-shek troops would not have been able to abduct all the residents of Dachen and other islands to Taiwan, nor would they have been able to destroy Dachen and other islands so cruelly.

The investigation team believes that it is necessary to expose the truth about the "peaceful" "withdrawal" that the United States is vigorously promoting to the world. Because this crime is absolutely intolerable by the humanitarian principles maintained by the Red Cross.

For the survival of the more than 20,000 abducted residents of Dachen and other islands, for the conscience and justice of mankind, and to prevent such a catastrophe from happening again in other peaceful lands in the world, we appeal to the people of the world to rise up and sanction this extremely brutal and inhumane criminal behavior of the U.S. government by all feasible means.

    大陈浩劫
    ——中国红十字会关于蒋军在美国指使和掩护下撤出大陈等岛时所犯罪行的调查报告书
   （二）劫运以外的残暴罪行
    美国军队和蒋介石军队不但强迫二万多名大陈等岛上的居民背乡离井，并且还放火焚烧了这些居民用毕生心血所经营的店铺和所建造的住房。未被烧毁的店铺与住房以及其他财产，也遭到了疯狂的抢劫与破坏。使得居民们失去了他们世世代代赖以生存的生产工具与血汗结晶，使得他们再也无以为生，再也无家可归。
    （甲）焚烧和破坏
    调查团在大陈、渔山、披山和南麂等岛就美军与蒋军对当地居民住房的焚烧和破坏作了详细的调查。
    调查团发现大陈岛上共有二十个村庄和街镇的民房被烧毁。这些村庄和街镇是：东坑、大沙头、西咀头、南坑街、南田、竹牛坑、山盘岭、象斗岙里、小岙里、关帝岙、大岙里、南砍、固定里、淡头、前山、小半天、大半天、东山头、中嘴、象斗岙。其中东坑、山盘岭、象斗岙、小岙里、关帝岙等村庄的房屋已被全部烧毁，到处都是一片片的废墟。现在已经不能辨别出这些房屋原来的面貌，也很难找得到一件完整的家具或物品。
    调查团得到一个曾在下大陈南坑街当浴池茶房的林子清的帮助，知道了南坑街上门牌号码第一号到第二十二号的共五十二间民房，已被全部烧毁。这些房子的主人，有几代都居住在大陈岛的杂货店店主林端云，有靠种菜过活的老农民杜岩宣，有开茶馆的陈寿君等三十三户。在这个连成一片的瓦砾场上，一切都被烧光了，连用作屋基的大石板都烧裂了。在南坑街头，调查团发现在两个相距大约有十公尺左右的废墟之间，放着三只美国军用汽油桶。
    大沙头附近原有三十二户居民，他们的房屋已被全部烧毁。在渔民叶小侬的房屋的废墟上，没有上过油的新鱼网被烧成一堆白灰。熟悉这一带情况的居民林明瑶说：“叶小侬的房子是他父亲留给他的，他非常爱护这座房子，发现房子有一个破洞就立即修补。如果他现在知道这房子已被烧毁，他该多么悲痛。”在这块废墟上，有一间原是卖糖小贩江文正一家四口居住的草屋，现在这里只剩下主人制糖用的铲、刀、锅和印模了。
    南麂岛上的村庄遭到了同样的破坏。其中有六个村庄几乎全部烧毁，被烧毁的民房共有一百六十五座。这些村庄是：
    外火棍岙：原有民房六十一座，烧毁六十座。
    大沙岙：原有民房三十二座，烧毁三十一座。
    马祖岙：原有民房四十一座，烧毁三十七座。
    打铁洞：原有民房十八座，烧毁十七座。
    二垅：原有民房十五座，全部烧毁。
    上百亩坪：原有民房十二座，烧毁五座。
    在这些村庄的废墟上，石头烧得焦黑，土壁烧成了红色。调查团在废墟上，看到了不少鱼网的灰烬和烧坏了的磁网坠子、铁锚、锄头、镰刀、铁耙、铁锨、锯条、凿子……。居民们保存在罐子里的少量谷物已被烧得枯黑，许多碗、盆、罐，全被烧得爆裂了。在马祖岙的废墟上，有一个约二尺高的石臼烧破了，石臼旁边有一个烧掉了柄的石锤，这是居民用以舂米的工具。在这附近，还有一只被烧死了的羊。
    据现在住在浙江省平阳县鳌江镇的渔民钱兴铭说，他原在南麂岛大沙岙有四座祖父遗留下来的房子。钱兴铭在一九五二年六月逃出南麂岛时，把房子交给他的岳父孔相镐管理。现在孔相镐已被蒋军劫走，钱兴铭的四座房子，一座过去被蒋军修操场时拆掉，另外三座房子和家具，这次全被烧毁了。在这些被烧毁的房屋旁边，有涂着美国军用标志的汽油桶。
    在披山岛，蒋军在中岙、南岙山头、上坎门三个村庄共烧毁、炸毁民房四十一间。原来居住在披山岛的王思汉，向调查团控诉了蒋军毁坏他的房屋和杀害他的亲人的罪行。王思汉现在在玉环县坎门镇开设联泰和酒店。他在披山老家有一座楼房。这座楼房在一九五零年被蒋军强占，全家被赶到一个草棚里居住。他的三弟王思操由于反抗蒋军的压榨而遭到杀害；二弟王思清被蒋军捉到下大陈做苦工，现在生死不明。披山解放后，王思汉回到披山，看到自己的楼房被炸毁了：正中五间楼房已成瓦砾，下面还有炸药爆炸的土坑，旁边两间楼房的屋顶也倒塌下来。王思汉看到这种悲惨情景放声大哭，他说：“蒋介石害得我家破人亡。”
    调查团特别注意到：在各个岛上被焚烧的房屋废墟附近，总有一个或几个汽油桶，这些汽油桶上写着：“From　USA for Mutual　Defense”（来自美国，为了共同防御）。
    大陈、渔山、披山、南麂等岛，在蒋军撤走以前约有渔船、商船三百多只。这些勤劳的居民所赖以为生的渔船和商船，有的被蒋军撤走时抢走了，有的被蒋军破坏了。调查团在上述各岛，没有看到一只完整的商船和渔船。
    在下大陈大沙头附近的海滩上，有几十只被破坏了的渔船。其中，有许多渔船已被砸成木片，杂乱地搁在海滩上或者漂浮在港湾里。还有一些成形的船只，翻倒在海滩上，每只船的船底都有很大的窟窿，可以看出这是用沉重的东西砸开的。
    在南麂岛的大沙岙，后垅、火棍岙三个港口，有四十二只渔船和商船被破坏了。在火棍岙滩头上，有四只被破坏了的较大的渔船和商船。其中一只装着红糖，另一只装着蓑衣。装蓑衣的船的中舱里，留有一包装有雷管、导火索而没有爆炸的美国黄色炸药包，有两根很长的导火索还挂在船的一边。在距离这只船约一公尺的地方，调查团又捡到了两块没有爆炸的黄色炸药。
    披山岛原有的四十多只渔船，已经全部遭到破坏。在南岙码头，有两只大渔船被蒋军沉没在海里。
    在下大陈南坑街等港湾，调查团看到了蒋军劫运居民时用渔船、商船搭成的临时码头。有些船已经半沉在水里，有些船还三个一组、五个一组被铁链条连在一起，上面横七竖八地铺着门板、床板、柜台板甚至棺材板。受难居民苏炳麟、林明瑶控诉说，蒋军在撤走前强拉了居民的一百二十只渔船、商船，做成了四个临时码头，并在最后把这些船爆破了。
    调查团在下大陈还看到大批的渔船被从海里拉到了山坡上。在下大陈南坑里蒋介石的温岭县警察局门口的山坡上，就有七只这样的渔船。这些渔船已经全部被破坏了。有一只船上被砸了十一个大大小小的洞，其他渔船至少也被砸了五、六个洞。王其昌说，这些渔船都是蒋军撤走前下命令叫渔民拉上山去的。一月二十三日半夜，蒋军强迫黄夫礁的渔民，把自己的渔船全部摇到浪通门拉上山去。那天夜里，他也被强迫把自己的渔船摇去了。调查团随王其昌到了浪通门，看到从滩头一直到山坡上，
  一共有二十七只大小渔船。有的船和船叠在一起，有的船翻倒在乱草上，许多船已经裂开一条条的缝。船上篷、桅杆、船舵和舱板几乎全部没有了，在海滩上有六块遗落下来的舱板和一根桨桩。王其昌在这一大堆破坏了的渔船中，很快地认出了自己的小钓鱼船。他的船只剩下一个空壳了。他还认出来许多渔船的主人是谁，并一只只地指点给调查团看。这里面有受难的妇女王香花家里的渔船（第二一二九号），被蒋军劫走的渔民马梅玉（第二一三一号）、陈三玉（第二一三二号）、朱兴彩（第二一二五号）、郑四玉（第二一二六号）、沈正土（第二一二八号）、马显记（第二一二一号）、陈老五（第二一三○号）等的渔船。王其昌向调查团控诉说：“现在春季的渔汛到来了，大陈海里墨鱼、黄鱼很多，要不是国民党把我们害成这个样子，这几天我们正在海上忙着捕鱼呢！”在大小浦等地，所有的渔船也受到了同样的破坏。调查团还注意到大批鱼网也被毁坏了。在下大陈通向海军码头一段一里多长的公路上，断断续续地铺着一张一张的鱼网，并已被深深地踏进泥土里，上面还有汽车胶轮的痕迹。
    蒋军还破坏了大陈、渔山、披山、南麂等岛上的公用设备和许多庙宇。
    调查团视察了下大陈被蒋军破坏的各主要水井、水池和水库，这些都是大陈居民辛勤建成的共同财富。受难的居民叶坚林告诉调查团说，下大陈的淡水很缺，天旱时，许多居民天没亮就到井边或池边排队取水。近几年来，居民付出了很大的劳动力，修建了十多处水井、水池，并正在修建一个大水库。现在这些水井、水池和水库，都被蒋军破坏了。其中有七个水井、水池和一个正在修建的大水库被破坏得最严重。这个将要修建完工的大水库位置在玻璃坑，它被破坏的情况是：一条高约十公尺、长约二十公尺的水坝，被炸塌下去近四公尺，工地上许多工具、水管、钢材和木料也被炸坏。叶坚林曾经参加修建这个水库。他说：“为了修建这个水库，从去年八月起，我们南田村和南坑里等九个村镇，每天都有五十多个老百姓来到这里做工。”半年来，当地居民在这里曾付出了近万个日工的劳动。在这个被炸毁的水坝的乱石堆里，调查团发现了美国特拉华州威尔明敦市赫古勒斯火药公司（Wilmington，Delaware
　Hercules　PowderCompany　Incorporated）制造的电发爆炸雷管外套一个。在浪通门西南山麓被炸毁的水池边，调查团也挖出了一捆十三磅重的、已经装好雷管、导火索的美国阿兰敦市特洛詹火药公司（Allentown
  Trojan　Powder　Co．）制造的高级炸药。
    下大陈南田村的大路边上，有一个面积约有六平方公尺的水池。小坑里的受难居民郏吴氏告诉调查团：这个水池是在抗日战争初期修建起来的。十多年来，一向是附近一百多户居民的主要水源。现在，调查团看到这个池内丢满了蒋军肮脏的破军衣、公文纸、子弹和印有“国军”字样的破毛巾。在大沙头广场上的一个水井里面，也丢满了木柴、子弹箱和脏物，井水已经变成了黑色，散发出臭味，井壁上还有烟火薰黑的痕迹。
    渔山岛大岙南山坡下，也有一个被蒋军炸毁的淡水池。这个水池长约五公尺、宽约三公尺、深约一点五公尺，从山上流下的泉水蓄于池中。渔民梅阿根说，岛上的大岙、小岙、杏花岙居民都是使用这个池里的水。现在，这个水池的北面横墙已被全部炸塌，水泥块散落到十公尺以外的地方。在灯塔附近，还有另一个被炸毁的淡水池。这个水池长约七公尺、宽约五公尺、深约一公尺。据梅阿根说，在他十一岁那年，一连三个月没有下雨，全岛的水源都干了，只有这个水池还有水。当时，这个水池不仅供给了渔山岛全岛居民的用水，而且还供给了经常到渔山岛一带捕鱼的二百多只渔船上渔民的用水。
    南麂岛大沙岙、山脚寮、上百亩坪、打铁洞等村庄附近的水井和水源，也都被蒋军倒上了汽油和垃圾。
    调查团在下大陈南坑里调查时，视察了一所卫生院的遗址。这是大陈岛唯一的民用医院。现在这所有一百八十平方公尺大的医院被烧毁了。残存的三间小房子，门窗全被捣碎了。成团的纱布绑带、药品与医疗器械，被乱抛在地上，一桶刚开口的凡士林，里面渗进了烂草和泥土。
    下大陈的三个主要学校中正中学、勾践小学、国民学校，也遭到了破坏。中正中学教室的一根木柱已被烧焦了，房壁上有几块铁皮被砸掉下来，室内的教具也被破坏了。勾践小学的门窗几乎全部被打坏，两块黑板抛在校门口公路旁边，已被践踏得破裂。剩下的几张课桌，桌腿被砸断了，教室内满地都是被撕碎的图表和课本。
    南麂岛大沙岙北面的一所小学校也被烧毁了，留下的只是烧不掉的石桌石凳。
    大陈岛上的许多庙宇也被蒋军炸毁和破坏了。在调查过程中，调查团了解到，大陈岛上的居民多数信仰佛教。岛上共有三十座庙宇。现在，观音堂、地藏庙、杨府庙已被全部炸毁；娘娘庙、渔师庙、无常庙、观音庙各一座，土地庙、平水大帝庙、关帝庙各两座，也都遭到了不同程度的破坏。南坑里的观音堂，被炸得梁柱、门窗交叉倒在一起，观音菩萨的头部被炸得只剩下木桩，其他神像也被炸得缺头缺臂，香炉、香桌，已经不见了。林子清说，过去观音堂里有两个和尚，一九五三年五月，蒋军要把这两个和尚抓去当兵，当时和尚一面哭泣，一面念着阿弥陀佛。后来，岛上信仰佛教的人凑了一笔钱，才把和尚赎出来。现在，这两个和尚也被劫运到台湾去了。郏吴氏领着调查团视察了最受大陈岛妇女信仰的娘娘庙。这个庙曾被蒋军的海军占作仓库，一走进去就闻到又臭、又酸的霉气。满地都是蒋军丢的烂军衣、臭罐头和拉的大便。正殿的殿顶被捣了十三个洞。主神娘娘的泥塑倒在地上，左胳膀已摔断。刻着各种花纹的神位宫沿也被打碎了。郏吴氏看到这种情景很难受，她说，往年这个时候，正是渔民下海捕鱼的季节，渔民的妈妈、老婆、女儿，都到这庙里烧香，祈祷娘娘保佑他们的亲人下海安全。她说：“现在没有人来烧香了，人都被劫走了。”
    调查团在大陈岛进行调查的时候，还发现蒋军撤走前，在离防御工事很远的居民的菜园里、麦地里、房屋附近和水井旁边，埋了许多地雷。调查团的三个团员在去浪通门的公路旁的麦田里，几乎踩上一个尚未扫除的地雷。
    中国人民解放军某部副连长陈玉坤、排长伍湘云、战士应官奎带着调查团作了调查。调查团在下大陈下嘴头村庄附近南、北、西三个方向的菜园和麦地上，看到有许多雷坑。这个村庄几乎被地雷包围起来，只有通往公路的地段没有雷，虽然在这个村庄里没有任何军事设施。调查团还在下嘴头西北面的一个布雷区上进行了详细的调查。这个雷区长约三百公尺，宽约二百公尺，设在一级级的梯田中，离居民房屋只有十公尺远。现在田里的小麦已长了半尺多高，地雷也被中国人民解放军的工兵扫除，麦丛中还留有三百九十个雷坑。雷坑与雷坑的距离有的是一至一点五公尺，有的只有五十公分。这些雷坑有些是圆的，有些是长方形的。陈玉坤说，圆形的坑是埋M14型地雷的，长方形的坑是埋M7型地雷的。
    调查团对在这村庄周围挖出来的三种类型的地雷作了观察，发现都是美国制造的。其中有一种M14型的，雷壳上有“MINE　APERS．NM．M14．WITH　FUZE　INTEGRAL　PARTS　MFRA．BY  LOP15-753-54”的字样。伍湘云说，M14型地雷的雷壳全部用胶质制造的，是专门用来炸断人的下肢的。M3和M7型的地雷是铁质的，M3地雷壳上的字样是：“MINE　ANTI-PERSONNEL M3　LOADERS　LOT　KOP1—13　6—1943”它有七、八磅重，杀伤半径约十公尺。M7型地雷壳上的字样是：“MINE　M7　A2　LOP．1—11，1—53”。
    蒋军从大陈岛撤走前，还在其它没有完全焚烧和破坏掉的村庄附近埋了地雷。在中正中学附近的操场上，就埋了四十三个M14型地雷。在下大陈双家岙居民食用的“再兴泉”旁边，也埋有M14型地雷。现在，这些区域的地雷已大体扫清了。陈玉坤说，他们从二月十三日到二十一日的一个星期中，在岛上共扫除了七千四百九十七个地雷。乙、抢劫和掠夺
    调查团走遍了下大陈的商业区大沙头的大街小巷，看到所有大陈岛居民的店铺、货栈和作坊都遭到了疯狂的抢劫。门板和窗扇不见了，门上的招牌和横匾，有的丢在阴沟里，有的悬在半空东摇西晃。大沙头原来约有两千商人，经营着杂货、金银、广货、布匹、文具、钟表、理发、缝纫、烟酒、粮食、菜馆、浴室等数十种行业。蒋军在撤走时烧毁了许多店铺，炸毁了一些房屋。艺林照相馆店主林明瑶、陈大兴酱油店店主陈正谊、郑益兴中西成衣铺店主郑楷梅、建大商行伙计苏炳麟、大陈浴池茶房林子清等人，都向调查团诉说蒋军疯狂破坏和抢劫大陈商店的情形。他们说，这座市镇在许多年前，曾经不断遭受过军阀、日本帝国主义的掠夺和破坏；但是那些破坏和掠夺，都没有像这次这样残酷。
    调查团详细地调查了商业最集中的小康街。这里原来有五十七家店铺，包括百货店、钟表店、照像馆、银楼、刻字铺、咸货店、猪肉铺、饭馆、理发店、鞋店、米店和酱园等二十多种行业。在几家残存的百货店和杂货店的门框上，虽然还能看到半截“本店主人封”的封条，但门窗都不见了。店内像是垃圾堆，臭气薰人，玻璃柜台和货橱被砸碎了。一些廉价的货物土蜡、草纸、粉笔、浆糊等等，扔得遍地都是。在破烂东西堆里，夹杂着蒋军丢下的破军衣、军裤。在一家鞋店的货橱旁边，丢有十多双蒋军穿过的军用胶鞋和黄棉鞋。另一家食品商店里，满地是罐头桶和酒瓶，有些被打开的酒瓶里还有大半瓶酒，有的罐头打开以后也只吃了一点。调查团在罐头桶旁边拾到两把美国刺刀。几家咸货店里的家具货物全被破坏了。腌鱼缸被打破了，虾皮、咸鱼丢了满地，装货的大木桶被打翻了，有的里面还拉上了大便，丢着一些破军衣和破军帽。在松鹤堂国药店里，六十多个装药的抽屉全部拉开了，许多草药撒在地上。东南西药房的药瓶子，几乎全部砸碎了。理发店里的镜子被砸得粉碎，转椅的靠背被打掉了，皮垫被刺刀穿了许多洞。饭馆里的桌凳打坏了，锅灶砸塌了，几只小锅也被砸掉了底。在店铺主人和伙计的住屋里面，上锁的箱子，不是盖子砸碎了，就是箱子背砸开了；柜子上的抽屉丢在地上，纸糊的顶棚和墙壁上，有刺刀戳的洞。
    陈正谊还带着调查团去看他自己的酱油店。主人告诉我们，他被捕以后，他的店就关门了，那时货架上有二百多瓶酱油，另外还有十一坛酒。蒋军撤走后的第二天，他被中国人民解放军从洋岐岛上救回来，看见自己的店门被砸开了，店里的东西没有了，栈房里的货物也不见了，几本账簿也被撕毁了；只有蒋军在墙上写下的许多标语，院子里到处是大便。郑楷梅的成衣店也被抢劫一空。他说，他被抓进监牢以后，家里只剩下一个四十多岁的妻子和三个孩子，大的孩子才八岁，小的刚满一周岁。他被抓走的时候家里东西很多，但是回来以后，三部缝纫机的机头没有了，一只新皮箱、两件皮袍、三床棉被也全都没有了。他说：“一个女人带三个孩子怎么能拿走这些东西呢？”他当着调查团，找出了丢在他家的两套蒋军的棉军衣和一只皮袍的袖子。他说：“这两套军衣是国民党抢了我的好衣服以后丢下来的。”接着，他又领调查团去看蒋军写在他家墙上的标语，他说：“国民党在我家抢够了，还在我家墙上乱涂了这些标语。”郑楷梅说到这里哭了。他说，他自己成年累月地省吃俭用，连一根布条也舍不得丢掉，一个月以前他还和自己的妻子打算怎样把店铺经营好，没想到会有这样的大祸临头。受难的居民吴时孝还告诉调查团说，一月二十五日蒋介石的大陈区行政督察专员公署在下令强迫居民到台湾去的时候，就规定每个居民所携带的行李不准超过三十公斤，强迫商店廉价出售其余的物资，一个价值十多元台币的脸盆只准卖两元。当时蒋军便开始在街上抢购贱货。以后，专员公署又发动了一个所谓“劳军运动”，迫使许多店铺在门上贴出“欢迎军人来拿货”的条子。一月二十九日，蒋军强迫一些店铺把门板摘下来搭码头。当店铺大门洞开的时候，蒋军便放了一次假的防空警报，驱赶店铺的主人和伙计上山防空，乘机进店抢去很多东西。蒋军大陈防卫部航运站还以对半分的“托运”为名，把商店的贵重物资骗运到船上，抢走了这些店铺的物资。
    调查团在这些岛上的渔村和农村里，同样看到遭受蒋军抢劫后的凄惨景象。沿途和村子附近，到处是一堆堆又湿又臭的鸡毛、猪毛、猪肠子，还有大米、蕃薯干、黄豆。渔民和农民的房屋的门窗全都被砸开了，有的门板不见了，有的门板倒在屋里；桌椅板凳东倒西歪，破衣旧裤、帽子鞋袜从屋里拖到屋外；上了锁的箱子、橱柜全被捣毁了，里面只剩下一些布条、破衣、碎纸、断线、扣子等不值钱的东西。地上留下的是蒋军的军衣、军鞋、裤带、擦枪油，甚至还有子弹和手榴弹。
    在下大陈的很多农村里，看不到饲养的家畜木栏里有一口猪、一只羊、或是一只鸡。带着调查团前去调查的居民王梦正说：“我还未被国民党囚禁以前，那时很多猪、羊、鸡，就被准备撤走的国民党压低价钱收买去了。他们说老百姓到台湾去，带的东西不准超过重量。从一月二十七日起，他们强迫老百姓把猪、羊、鸡统统杀掉，换取台币。猪肉每斤由十二元台币压到三元台币。老百姓没有办法，只得流着泪杀掉这些家畜。可是到后来，猪肉竟被国民党压低到一元五角台币一斤了。”苏炳麟、郑楷梅等受难居民，也控诉了蒋军的这一罪行。调查团还访问了大沙头附近一个农民的家。主人陈三妹是被中国人民解放军从洋岐岛上救出来的。他的屋里乱七八糟地丢着一些破衣碎片，几只未洗过的破碗，筷子和菜盆；四块床板倒在地上，床下一只空酒坛被打了个洞，小木橱里没有一点东西，只有锅子里还放着一碗发臭的豆酱。陈三妹含着满眶眼泪向调查团控诉说：“去年年底以前（农历），我还没有被抓进警察局的时候，我和妻子两人磨好了二斗高粱粉，准备再买一斤猪肉，买些鱼，过个新年。那里知道我无缘无故被抓去，妻子还被强逼到台湾去。现在我一看到家就要落眼泪。”当调查团询问他是否还剩下锄头、镢头等农具的时候，陈三妹双手一摊，连连摇头说：“没有了！什么也没有了。”
    下大陈黄夫礁的渔民王守鉴向调查团控诉了蒋军抢劫他的渔船“乌浪古”的罪行说：“我被囚禁在洋岐岛的时候，亲眼看见一只国民党的机帆，在美国军舰的保护下，拖着我的‘乌浪古’开走了。”王守鉴说，这只“乌浪古”能装二百担鱼，是他用四十多年来在海上捕鱼积蓄起来的五百六十块银元买的。这只被抢走的“乌浪古”船上，还装有二千多斤海蜇。这些海蜇是他和其他五户渔民合伙捞来腌起的。
    调查团在披山、渔山和南麂等岛调查中，也发现蒋军抢劫商店、居民财物的情形，并从蒋军丢下的两本日记上得到了证实。像是副班长写的那本日记中，在二月十二日的一页上写道：“近数天来，每天都是吃猪肉，吃得大家喜气洋洋。可是对于老百姓就太工（痛）苦了，每条猪从小养到大，他的希望是多赚点钱；好（谁）知相反的……”在另一本像是传令兵写的日记中，他在二月二十日的一页上写道：“今天是礼拜天，在吃过午饭以后，都跑后龙（垅）看老百姓搬东西……我们军人乱的一太（塌）糊涂，拿（有）的拿地瓜，有的拿菜，嘿！这个味道真是不好说，说起来好像在大陆上失败的那个样子，不管是什么东西都是乱拿，都要想发洋财……”（调查团注：日记中的有些标点和括号内的字，都是我们按的。）
    结论
    在作了上述实地调查后，我们不得不以难以抑制的沉痛和愤慨，向全国人民与全世界人民指出：
    美国军队和蒋介石军队在大陈等岛劫运二万多居民的行为，是一种极端残暴非人道的罪行。在美国政府指使和美国军队参与下，蒋军是用严密控制、武力威胁、焚烧房屋和大肆抢劫等暴力手段，来实现他们的罪恶阴谋的。它使得大陈等岛居民赖以生存的各种条件，在美国政府指定的时间突然毁灭了；它使得大陈等岛居民的正常生活，在美国政府指定的时间突然停止了；它强迫大陈等岛居民含着眼泪离开自己世世代代居住的故土，和一滴血一滴汗积累起来的产业；它强迫大陈等岛居民含着眼泪抛掉自己温暖的家庭，丈夫失去妻子，孩子失去母亲。
    美国政府对于这一极端残暴非人道的罪行，应负主要责任。如果没有美国政府命令出动两倍于这些岛上居民的海空军，如果没有美国军事当局调集大量的运输船只参与劫运行动，如果没有美国军事当局供给大量炸药、汽油，并派遣爆破技术人员直接参与焚烧和破坏，蒋军是不可能把大陈等岛的居民全部劫运到台湾去的，也不可能把大陈等岛破坏得这样残酷。
    调查团认为必须向全世界揭露美国所大肆宣传的“和平”“撤退”的真象。因为这种罪行是红十字会维护的人道主义的原则所绝对不能容许的。
    为了大陈等岛二万多名被劫运的居民的生存，为了人类的良心和正义，为了避免这样的浩劫再一次在世界其他和平土地上发生，我们向全世界人民呼吁，要求你们以一切可行的方法，起来制裁美国政府这种极端残暴非人道的犯罪行为。
