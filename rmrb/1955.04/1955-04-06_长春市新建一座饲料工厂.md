    Changchun is building a new locally-owned state feed factory, and the factory building construction project is nearing completion. Workers are busy installing twelve pulverizers in the pig feed workshop; management personnel have begun preparations for production.
    After this feed factory starts production in May, it is estimated to produce 15 tons of chicken feed and 29 tons of pig feed per day, which can provide enough feed for 12,000 chickens and ducks and 1,160 fat pigs for one day. This feed is made from grain hulls and wheat bran as raw materials. Every 10,000 tons of pig feed and 5,000 tons of chicken feed produced can save the country 5,000 tons of bran and 2,000 tons of grain.

    长春市新建一座饲料工厂
    长春市新建地方国营饲料工厂厂房建筑工程即将竣工。工人们正忙着安装猪饲料车间的十二台粉碎机；管理人员已开始进行生产前的准备工作。
    这座饲料工厂在五月开工生产后，估计日产鸡饲料十五吨，猪饲料二十九吨，可供一万二千只鸡鸭和一千一百六十口肥猪一天食用。这种饲料是用谷皮子和麦麸子作原料进行加工制成的。每生产一万吨猪饲料和五千吨鸡饲料，就可为国家节省五千吨糠和二千吨粮食。
