Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 15th: Nearly one thousand Calcutta citizens held a demonstration on the 14th to protest the crimes of American-Chiang Kai-shek agents in murdering members of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference and Indian pilots. Several members of the West Bengal Provincial Assembly also participated in the demonstration.

The demonstrators held up placards and shouted slogans such as "Punish the American and Kuomintang devils who caused the deaths of Indian pilots and Chinese officials," "Defeat the American conspiracy to undermine the Bandung Conference," and "Imperialists, get out of Asia!"

After marching through the main streets of Calcutta, the demonstrators arrived at the U.S. Consulate in Calcutta. At the insistence of the demonstrators, U.S. Consulate personnel were forced to meet with representatives of the demonstrators, who handed over a memorandum to the U.S. Consulate personnel. The memorandum condemned the murder by American-Chiang Kai-shek agents as a "cowardly conspiracy to undermine the Bandung Conference." U.S. Consulate personnel promised to forward the memorandum to the U.S. government.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 15th: Indian newspapers have widely commented on the plane crash involving members of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference and have called for a thorough investigation. The "National Herald" of Lucknow published a commentary on the 14th, saying, "It is incorrect to describe this incident as an accident. What is known so far proves the Chinese government's accusation of sabotage. It is important that the Chinese government warned the Hong Kong authorities that sabotage might occur."

The "Hindustan Times" published an editorial on the 14th, saying, "The fate of the passengers and crew is tragic for both India and China, but widespread regret will be expressed by all who had high hopes for the Bandung Conference and find that these advance personnel have suffered misfortune." The editorial said, "The warning about possible sabotage given in advance to the Hong Kong authorities by the British Chargé d'Affaires in Beijing was ignored by the latter."

The "Statesman" published an editorial on the 14th, saying that the cause of the plane crash is worth studying. The editorial said that a full investigation into this tragic incident has been ordered. Perhaps, investigators have never needed to conduct such a thorough and rapid investigation into the cause of an unfortunate event as they do now.

The Bengali newspaper "Ananda Bazar Patrika" published an editorial on April 13th, saying that the crash was truly heartbreaking. The editorial expressed condolences to the relatives of all the victims.

The "Times of India" of Bombay and the "Free Press Journal" of Bombay both called for a "thorough and impartial investigation" of the incident in their commentaries on the 14th. The "Free Press Journal" ridiculed the American denial as "rather overconfident," and said, "Is the United States really unable to be responsible for the Kuomintang or unable to say that it is fully aware of its espionage work?"

    加尔各答人民示威抗议美蒋特务的罪行
    新华社新德里十五日电　加尔各答市民将近一千人十四日举行示威游行，抗议美蒋特务谋杀中国出席亚非会议代表团人员及印度飞行员的罪行。西孟加拉省议会的几位议员也参加了这次示威。
    示威者高举着标语牌，并高呼：“惩罚使印度飞行员和中国官员们遇难的美国和国民党魔鬼”，“击败美国破坏万隆会议的阴谋”和“帝国主义滚出亚洲去”等口号。
    示威者在走过加尔各答的主要街道之后，到达美国驻加尔各答领事馆。在示威者的坚持要求之下，美国领事馆人员被迫接见了示威者的代表。示威者的代表向美国领事馆人员递交了一项备忘录。备忘录斥责美蒋特务的谋杀事件是“破坏万隆会议的怯懦的阴谋。”美国领事馆人员答应把备忘录转交美国政府。
    新华社新德里十五日电　印度报纸就中国出席亚非会议代表团人员座机被破坏失事一事广泛发表评论，并要求进行彻底的调查。勒克瑙的“国民先驱报”十四日发表评论说，“把这次事件说成是一次意外事件是不正确的，到目前为止所知道的情况，证明了中国政府关于破坏行动的指责。香港是一个间谍窝，中国政府曾警告香港当局可能有破坏事件发生，这是很重要的。”
      “印度斯坦时报”十四日发表社论说，“旅客和机上人员的命运对于印度和中国是可悲的事，不过，凡是一直对万隆会议寄予期望、然而发现这些先遣人员竟然遭受不幸的人都会广泛地表示痛惜的。”社论说，“英国驻北京代办向香港当局事先提出的关于可能有破坏活动的警告，被后者忽视了。”
    “政治家报”十四日发表社论说，飞机失事原因是值得研究的。社论说，已经下令对这一悲惨事件进行充分调查。也许，调查者从来没有像现在这样需要对不幸事件的原因进行如此深入、如此迅速的调查。
    孟加拉文报纸“欢喜市场报”四月十三日发表社论说，这次失事事件真是使人心碎。社论对所有遇难者的亲属表示哀悼。
    孟买“印度时报”、孟买“自由新闻”都在十四日的评论中，要求对这一事件进行“彻底的和公正的调查”。“自由新闻”嘲笑美国的抵赖态度是“未免过于自信”，并说：“难道美国真的不能为国民党负责或是不能说是完全知道它的特务工作吗？”
