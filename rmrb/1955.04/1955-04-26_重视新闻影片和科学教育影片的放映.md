    Emphasizing the Screening of Newsreels and Science Education Films
    Zhu Shulan
    Good newsreels and educational science films are welcomed by the people. They can timely reflect the ever-changing face of national construction in all aspects, vividly carry out current affairs education and disseminate scientific knowledge. When discussing the role of newsreels, Lenin believed that they were "visualized political essays," while science education films were "visualized popular lectures."
    The current screening situation of such films in our country has not met the requirements of the broad masses of viewers. People are not satisfied with the few newsreels "attached" to each movie, and they demand to see more, and to see them in a concentrated manner. Therefore, it is necessary to designate one or more cinemas in large and medium-sized cities with the appropriate conditions to specialize in screening newsreels and science education films.
    Tianjin has had successful experience with news cinemas. In the initial stage of the opening of the Tianjin News Cinema last year, there were concerns that the audience's "interest in newsreels and science education films would not be great," but the number of viewers dispelled this concern. "National Day of 1954" was screened continuously for nine days, and "Liberation of Yijiangshan Island" was screened continuously for eleven days; the two science education films "Painless Childbirth" and "Safe Use of Electricity" were also screened for ten days, a total of sixty-five screenings. Until the last day of screening, the audience was still crowded. A reader of newspapers from Yideli Street in Tianjin said: "Newsreels are like living newspapers, which are more intimate to watch and help with newspaper reading work." After watching "Safe Use of Electricity," housewives went home and asked electricians to repair the broken light switches. The cinema also cooperated with the work and study of factories, institutions, schools, and street residents to hold various "special sessions," "teaching sessions," and "current affairs sessions"; because the films screened were new, the time was short, and there were many screenings (usually six screenings a day, ten screenings on Sundays), it was possible to establish regular contact with audiences from all aspects. The Red Star Cinema in the capital was converted into a cinema specializing in the screening of news documentaries and science education films, which was also welcomed by audiences in the capital.
    In cities where news cinemas have not been established, the audience is waiting eagerly. Zhao Qiong, a reader from Wuxi, wrote: "The vast majority of workers, students, PLA soldiers, and cadres in Wuxi like to watch news documentaries, but there are too few now. We hope that Wuxi can have a cinema dedicated to screening news documentaries. If there are difficulties, two or three screenings can be arranged on Sundays."
    Cultural departments and film screening units in various regions should pay attention to the demands of the people in this regard. Some units have an insufficient understanding of the special educational role of newsreels and science education films, and have adopted an indifferent attitude towards the people's demands for them, refusing to screen them under various excuses. For example, in Nanjing, three joint state-private cinemas stopped screening news documentaries as many as fifty-four times in half a year, and even the newsreel of the "Geneva Conference," which has great political significance, was not screened. This is completely wrong.
    On the other hand, relevant film studios should promptly summarize the experience of film production in this area, improve the ideological and artistic quality of news documentaries and science education films, overcome the old routine and boring preaching, and produce more interesting and vivid news documentaries and science education films, so that they can attract more audiences and play a greater educational role.

    重视新闻影片和科学教育影片的放映
    朱树兰
    好的新闻纪录影片和教育科学影片都受到人民群众的欢迎。它们能够及时地反映国家各方面建设的日新月异的面貌，生动地进行时事教育和传播科学知识。列宁在论及新闻影片的作用时，认为它是“形象化的政论”，科学教育片则是“形象化的通俗演讲”。
    我国当前这类影片的放映情况，没有满足广大观众的要求。人们不满足于每场电影“附加”的几本新闻片，要求多看，要求集中地看。因此，就有必要在有条件的大、中城市划出一个以至一个以上的电影院来专门放映新闻影片和科学教育影片。
    新闻电影院在天津已经有了成功的经验。天津新闻电影院在去年开幕初期，也曾耽心过观众对新闻片和科学教育片的“兴趣不大”，但观众的数字扫除了这一个顾虑。“一九五四年国庆节”连续放映了九天，“解放一江山岛”连续放映了十一天；两部科学教育片“无痛分娩”和“安全用电”，也映出十天共六十五场。这些影片直到放映的最后一天，观众仍然是拥挤的。天津义德里街道读报员说：“新闻影片好像活的报纸，看着更亲切，帮助了读报工作。”家庭妇女们看完“安全用电”后，回家就请电工把坏的电灯开关修好。电影院又配合工厂、机关、学校和街道群众的工作和学习，举办过各种“专题场”、“教学场”和“时事场”；由于放映的影片新、时间短、场次多（平时每天六场、星期日十场），因而能广泛地同各方面的观众建立经常的联系。首都的红星电影院改为专门放映新闻纪录片和科学教育片的影院，也受到首都观众的欢迎。
    在没有设立新闻电影院的城市，观众正迫切地等待着。无锡读者赵琼来信说：“无锡绝大多数工人、学生、解放军战士和机关干部欢喜看新闻纪录片，但现在太少了。我们希望无锡能有电影院专门放映新闻纪录片，如果有困难，可以在星期日放映两三场。”
    各地的文化部门和电影放映单位，应该重视人民群众对这方面的要求。有一些单位，对新闻影片和科学教育影片的特殊的教育作用认识不足，对人民群众对它们的要求采取了漠不关心的态度，用种种借口拒绝放映。如南京有三家公私合营影院在半年中停映新闻纪录片竟达五十四次，甚至连具有重大政治意义的“日内瓦会议”新闻片都不放映。这是完全不对的。
    另一方面，有关电影制片厂应该及时总结这一方面的制片工作的经验，提高新闻纪录影片和科学教育影片的思想性和艺术性，克服老一套和枯燥的说教，制作出更有趣味、更加生动的新闻纪录影片和科学教育影片，使它们能吸引更多的观众，发挥更大的教育作用。
