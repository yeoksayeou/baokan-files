    Tsinghua University Architecture Department Examines Architectural Thought
    Teachers at the Tsinghua University Architecture Department are currently engaged in a discussion on architectural thought, criticizing bourgeois formalism and revivalist thought within architectural thinking.
    After studying Khrushchev's speech at the All-Union Conference of Construction Workers, and hearing the communication of the spirit of the design and construction work conference convened by the Ministry of Construction Engineering of the People's Republic of China in February, the teachers of the architecture department have improved their ideological understanding and requested to carry out systematic study and discussion in order to improve teaching work. The Architecture Department has now established an Architectural Thought Study Committee. During the study process, Wu Liangyong, Deputy Director of the Architecture Department, Professor Zhou Buyi, and others, began to examine the erroneous thinking of the Architecture Department in pursuing the forms of ancient palaces and temples in teaching, violating the principles of applicability and economy, one-sidedly emphasizing the artistry of architecture, and underestimating industrial technology courses closely related to national construction. The Architecture Department also held a small exhibition, displaying lecture notes, design topics, drawings, models, etc. from various periods of the Architecture Department since liberation, in order to more specifically examine teaching thought and effectively improve work.

    清华大学建筑系检查建筑思想
    清华大学建筑系教师正开展建筑思想的讨论，批判建筑思想中资产阶级形式主义和复古主义思想。
    建筑系的教师们，学习了赫鲁晓夫在全苏建筑工作人员会议上的讲话，并听取了中华人民共和国建筑工程部二月份召开的设计及施工工作会议精神的传达后，思想认识有了提高，要求进行系统的学习讨论，以改进教学工作。现在建筑系已成立建筑思想学习委员会。在学习过程中，建筑系副主任吴良镛、教授周卜颐等，开始检查了建筑系在教学中追求古代的宫殿、庙堂的形式，违反适用、经济的原则，片面强调建筑的艺术性，轻视和国家建设密切相关的工业技术课程等错误思想。建筑系还举办了小型展览会，展出解放以来各个时期建筑系的讲义、设计题目、图纸、模型等，以便更具体地检查教学思想，有效地改进工作。　（新华社）
