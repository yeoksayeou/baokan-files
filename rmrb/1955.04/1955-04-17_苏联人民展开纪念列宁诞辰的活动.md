    Soviet People Launch Activities to Commemorate Lenin's Birth Anniversary
    By Our Correspondent in Moscow, Li He
    The 85th anniversary of the birth of the great Lenin is drawing nearer day by day. The Soviet people have begun grand commemorative activities. Central and local newspapers have begun publishing commemorative articles. Lectures and seminars are being held in various places. All places associated with Lenin's life and activities attract numerous visitors and admirers.

    The "Vladimir Ilyich" Electrical Machinery Plant in Moscow is a factory that Lenin visited more than once. The factory workers cherish the revolutionary tradition and strive to realize Lenin's ideal of national electrification through heroic labor. The factory workers completed the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule at the end of March, producing millions of rubles worth of extra products for the country. Labor productivity increased by 90 percent compared to 1950, and 200 new types of machines were produced in four years and three months.

    Two collections of memoirs about Lenin, edited by the Institute of Marxism-Engels-Lenin-Stalin under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have been published. One collection contains memoirs by Lenin's wife, Krupskaya, and his siblings about Lenin's childhood and revolutionary activities. The other is a collection of memoirs by Zetkin on her meetings with Lenin from 1920 to 1922, discussing issues such as art, culture, the international women's movement, and the German revolutionary movement. The two memoirs were published by the State Political Books Publishing Bureau and have been well received by the majority of readers. "Labor News," "Red Star," "Komsomol Truth," and "Soviet Culture News" have all published excerpts from the memoirs. Although these short articles only record fragments of Lenin's life, people can feel Lenin's great character: his close connection with the masses, his infinite belief that the masses are the decisive force in history, his uncompromising fighting spirit against all kinds of opportunism, his tireless energy, and his revolutionary optimism.

    In the memoirs, people see that the great Lenin always consulted with the masses first when deciding important matters, and listened to their opinions. According to Karpinsky, the former editor of "Poor Peasants' News," Lenin always asked him about the content of letters from peasants and the situation of peasant life. Lenin himself also read the letters from peasants forwarded by him. At the end of the domestic revolutionary war, the peasants were dissatisfied with the surplus grain requisition system. In the winter of 1920, Lenin asked Karpinsky to report in detail on letters from the countryside. Karpinsky reported on fifty letters from peasants. Lenin used these materials at the Tenth Congress of the Party, calling for the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance as a guarantee of final victory. Karpinsky also recalled that Lenin not only learned about rural life from letters from peasants but also from visiting peasants. Many peasants from all over the country came to the Kremlin in Moscow to see Lenin. Lenin kindly asked their names, patronymics, and where they came from, and had cordial conversations with them. Once, a visiting peasant jumped up from his chair and said very indignantly: "Comrade Lenin, what is going on? You must know that they are torturing us like this, torturing us like this!" Lenin comforted him and asked, "Who are they?" The peasant said, "They are the village soviet workers." Lenin asked, "Who elected them?" The peasant said, "Of course, it was us." Lenin said, "Then re-elect them." The peasant said, "Is it possible?" Lenin said, "Yes, and it should be. Soviet law allows the re-election of any representative who is not trusted by the people before the end of their term." The peasant thanked Lenin.

    In these days, more people are visiting the Lenin Central Museum next to Red Square. The museum has added a hall to exhibit photos and documents of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union resolutely implementing Lenin's will since Lenin's death. The slogan "Communism is our goal, Lenin is our banner" hangs on the wall. Here is the Central Committee's decision on recruiting workers into the Party. Under the glass frame are applications from workers requesting to join the Party. All this reminds people of the situation when more than 240,000 workers joined the Communist Party when Lenin passed away in 1924, and the working class became more united around the Party. Particularly noteworthy is the draft of Stalin's "Summary of the Work of the 14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," which begins with Lenin's words: "If we do not save heavy industry, if we do not restore heavy industry, we cannot build any industry, and without industry, we simply cannot maintain our position as an independent country."

### 苏联人民展开纪念列宁诞辰的活动

    苏联人民展开纪念列宁诞辰的活动
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    伟大的列宁的八十五周年诞辰一天天近了。苏联人民开始盛大的纪念活动。中央和地方报刊开始登载纪念文章。各地开始举行演讲和座谈。一切和列宁的生平活动相联系的地方都吸引众多人们的参观和景仰。
    莫斯科以“弗拉基米尔·伊里奇”为名的电机制造厂是列宁不止一次到过的工厂。工厂职工爱惜革命的传统，以英勇的劳动为实现列宁的国家电气化理想而努力着。工厂职工在三月底提前完成了五年计划，为国家额外增产了千百万卢布产品，劳动生产率比一九五○年增长了百分之九十，在四年又三个月中出产了二百种新式机器。
    苏联共产党中央委员会马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林学院编辑的两本回忆列宁的文集已经出版了。其中一本收集列宁的妻子克鲁普斯卡雅和他的兄弟姐妹们关于列宁童年和革命活动的回忆。另一本是蔡特金在一九二○年到一九二二年会见列宁谈论艺术、文化、国际妇女运动、德国革命运动等问题的回忆。两本回忆录由国家政治书籍出版局出版，得到了广大读者的欢迎。“劳动报”、“红星报”、“共青团真理报”、“苏维埃文化报”都摘登了回忆录。这些短文虽然只记载列宁的生活片断，但是人们从中感受到列宁的伟大性格：他和群众的密切联系，他对于群众是历史的决定力量的无限信念，他对各种机会主义不调和的斗争精神，他的不知疲倦的精力，他的革命的乐观主义。
    在回忆录中，人们看到了，伟大的列宁在决定重要事情时候总是先和群众商量，倾听群众的意见。据前“贫农报”主编卡尔平斯基回忆，列宁每次都询问他农民来信的内容，农民生活的情形。列宁自己也阅读由他转去的农民的信件。在国内战争末期，农民不满意余粮征收制。一九二○年冬天，列宁要求卡尔平斯基详细报告农村的来信。卡尔平斯基汇报了五十封农民来信。列宁在党第十次代表大会上使用了这些材料，号召巩固作为最后胜利的保障的工农联盟。卡尔平斯基还回忆说：列宁不但从农民来信而且从来访的农民中很好地了解农村生活。全国各地来莫斯科克里姆林宫谒见列宁的农民很多。列宁和霭地问他们的姓名、父名、那里来的，同他们进行亲切的谈话。有一次，有一个来访的农民从椅上跳起来，非常愤慨地说：“列宁同志，这是怎么一回事？要知道他们这样折磨我们，这样折磨我们！”列宁安慰他，问道：“他们是谁？”这位农民说：“是村苏维埃工作者。”列宁问：“谁选举了他们？”农民说：“当然是我们。”列宁说：“那末改选掉他们。”农民说：“难道可以吗？”列宁说：“可以，而且应当。苏维埃法律允许在任期未满以前改选任何为人民不信任的代表。”农民感谢了列宁。
    在这些日子里，更多的人们参观红场旁边的列宁中央陈列馆，陈列馆增设了一个厅，展览从列宁去世以来苏联共产党坚决地实现列宁的遗嘱的照片和文件。墙上挂着当日的标语：“共产主义是我们的目标，列宁是我们的旗帜。”这里摆着党中央关于吸收工人入党的决定。在玻璃框下有工人们请求入党的申请书。这一切使人回忆起一九二四年列宁逝世的时候，二十四万以上工人加入了共产党，工人阶级更加团结在党的周围的情形。特别令人注目的是斯大林写的“联共（布）第十四次代表会议的工作总结”的稿样，以列宁的话句开头：“不挽救重工业，不恢复重工业，我们就不能建成任何工业，而没有工业，我们就根本不能维持我们之为独立国家的地位。”
