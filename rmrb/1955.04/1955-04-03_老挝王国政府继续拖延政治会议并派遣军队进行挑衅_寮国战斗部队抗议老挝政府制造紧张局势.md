Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 2nd -- According to Vietnam News Agency on the 1st: Kaysone, the representative of the General Command of the Lao Fighting Units, met with a reporter from the Lao "Liberation Newspaper" on March 23rd, and discussed the current tensions provoked by the Royal Lao Government.

Kaysone said: "The Royal Lao Government, taking advantage of the Lao Fighting Units' strict implementation of the ceasefire agreement and the spirit of the agreement's terms, has expanded its offensives to the outskirts of Muong Phanh. The more the Lao Fighting Units try to avoid conflict, the more the other side intensifies its activities. All of these actions are part of the overall conspiracy of American imperialism, which seeks to gradually invade and ultimately occupy the two provinces designated as assembly areas for the Lao Fighting Units, eliminate the Lao Fighting Units, destroy peace in Laos, and turn Laos into an American colony and military base."

Kaysone also said: "In the political sphere, although the political delegation of the Royal Lao Government and the political delegation of the Lao Fighting Units have agreed to move the venue of the political meetings to Vientiane, the Royal Lao Government has consistently refused to implement this decision under various pretexts, attempting to delay the political meetings and force them to a standstill."

Kaysone concluded: "The Lao Fighting Units strongly protest the Royal Lao Government's lack of desire for peace. We demand that the Royal Lao Government, in order to properly fulfill its obligations, immediately order its armed forces to cease provocative actions, withdraw completely from the Muong Phanh, Na Xeng, Hong Heun, and Na Xon areas; at the same time, immediately order its delegation to resume political meetings with the Lao Fighting Units, and establish a joint political committee with the Lao Fighting Units to resolve various basic political issues related to national interests."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 2nd -- Lao news: To this day, the Royal Lao Government is still delaying the continuation of political meetings.

On March 9th, the political delegation of the Royal Lao Government and the political delegation of the Lao Fighting Units reached an agreement on the issue of the cessation of hostilities. At that time, it was also decided to move the political meeting to Vientiane to continue discussing the establishment of a political consultative committee and to negotiate and resolve relevant political issues. From March 12th to 14th, the two sides discussed the issue of relocating the meeting place, but the Royal side has been unable to resolve certain technical issues related to the relocation of the meeting place, bringing the political meeting to a standstill.

Moreover, since March 15th, troops commanded by French and Royal Lao officers have launched continuous attacks on the Lao Fighting Units in Sam Neua Province. The Royal Lao Government, however, falsely accused the Lao Resistance Forces of "attacking" the troops commanded by French and Lao officers, and the Royal Lao Government's representative even used this as a pretext to refuse to hold political meetings.

Lao sources believe that the attitude of the Royal Lao Government reflects that, under the influence of the United States, it is adopting a policy of delaying and undermining the Lao political meetings.

    老挝王国政府继续拖延政治会议并派遣军队进行挑衅
    寮国战斗部队抗议老挝政府制造紧张局势
    新华社河内二日电　据越南通讯社一日讯：寮国战斗部队总司令部代表凯山在三月二十三日接见老挝“解放报”记者，谈到目前老挝王国政府所挑起的紧张局势。
    凯山说：“老挝王国政府方面利用寮国战斗部队严格履行停战协定和协议条款的精神，把进攻扩大到了芒奔郊区，寮国战斗部队愈是努力避免冲突，对方愈是加紧活动。这一切行动都是美帝国主义的总阴谋的一部分，这个总阴谋是要逐步侵入并最后占领被指定为寮国战斗部队集结区的两省，消灭寮国战斗部队，破坏老挝的和平，把老挝变成美国的殖民地和军事基地。”
    凯山又说：在政治方面，虽然老挝王国政府政治代表团和寮国战斗部队政治代表团已经协议把政治会议的会议地点迁往万象，但是，老挝王国政府方面一直以各种借口拒绝执行这个决定，企图拖延政治会议，并迫使它陷于停顿。
    凯山最后说：“寮国战斗部队强硬抗议老挝王国政府方面缺乏和平愿望的行为。我们要求，老挝王国政府为了正确地履行它的义务，应命令武装部队立刻停止挑衅行动，全部从芒奔、那馨、洪嫩和乃森地区撤走；同时，立刻命令它的代表团恢复同寮国战斗部队举行的政治会议，并和寮国战斗部队成立一个联合政治委员会，以解决有关民族利益的各项基本政治问题。”
    据新华社河内二日电　老挝消息：到现在为止，老挝王国政府仍旧拖延着不肯继续举行政治会议。
    三月九日，老挝王国政治代表团和寮国战斗部队政治代表团在停止敌对行动问题上获得了协议，当时还决定将政治会议移到万象举行，继续讨论成立政治协商委员会和协商解决有关的政治问题。三月十二日到十四日的几天中，双方对迁移会场问题进行了讨论，但是王国方面一直不解决迁移会场的某些技术性问题，使政治会议陷于停顿。
    而且，三月十五日起，由法国和老挝王国军官指挥的军队连续向桑怒省内的寮国战斗部队发动了进攻，王国政府却诬蔑寮国抗战部队“进攻”了法国和老挝军官指挥的军队，王国政府的代表并且以此为借口拒绝举行政治会议。
    老挝人士认为：老挝王国政府的态度反映出，它在美国的影响下正在采取拖延和破坏老挝政治会议的政策。
