Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 9th: The United Nations Economic and Social Council discussed the issue of slave labor at its April 7th meeting. The specially appointed rapporteur on this issue was the Norwegian representative, Engen. He used his report to spread shameless slanders against the People's Republic of China, claiming that China was practicing "slave labor."

The Soviet representative, Sobolev, pointed out that the rapporteur's report included several slanderous lies about the People's Republic of China obtained from the Chiang Kai-shek clique and other dubious figures. The so-called materials cited by Engen were completely inconsistent with the facts, and the publication of these so-called materials should be regarded as an abuse of attacks against the People's Republic of China.

In view of the fact that the representatives of the People's Republic of China have not been able to occupy their legitimate seat in the United Nations due to American obstruction, and have been deprived of the opportunity to participate in the current Council meeting to defend China's interests, the Soviet Representative to the United Nations has sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, requesting him to publish several basic laws of the People's Republic of China concerning the protection of the political, economic rights and the creative labor of the Chinese people as United Nations documents. These laws completely refuted the slanders contained in Engen's report. The Soviet representative protested against the inclusion of slanderous lies against the great Chinese people in the report. The Council should not consider these lies. Sobolev emphasized that the Constitution of the People's Republic of China has explicitly stipulated all the rights in the social, economic, and political aspects that aim to guarantee the free labor of Chinese workers, peasants, and intellectuals.

The Soviet representative emphasized that discussing such slanderous "materials" in the Economic and Social Council would only damage the prestige of the United Nations. Sobolev opposed the first point in the proposal put forward by the Social Committee, which gave Engen's report a positive evaluation. He said that if this point was included, the Soviet delegation would abstain from voting on the entire proposal.

The representatives of the member states of the Economic and Social Council listened very carefully to the speech of the Soviet representative. It is worth noting that no representative of any member state in the Council came out to support the above-mentioned part of Engen's "report."

The Council passed the proposal put forward by the Social Committee, with the representatives of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia abstaining from voting.

    苏联代表在联合国经社理事会会议上
    驳斥诬蔑我国实行“奴隶劳动”的谎言
    新华社九日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国经济及社会理事会四月七日会议讨论了奴隶劳动问题。关于这个问题的特别指定的报告员是挪威代表恩根。他利用他的报告来散布对中华人民共和国的无耻的诽谤，说什么中国在实行“奴隶的劳动”。
    苏联代表索波列夫指出，报告员的报告中包括着若干从蒋介石集团和其他可疑人物那里搞来的对于中华人民共和国的诬蔑性谎言。恩根所引述的所谓材料根本同事实不符，发表这些所谓材料应当被认为是对中华人民共和国滥施攻击。
    鉴于中华人民共和国的代表由于美国的阻挠而未能在联合国中占有他们的合法席位，并且被剥夺了参加目前的理事会会议来为中国的利益辩护的机会，苏联驻联合国代表已经致函联合国秘书长，要求他把中华人民共和国关于保障中国人民的政治、经济权利和自由的创造性劳动的若干基本法律作为联合国的文件发表。这些法律完全驳倒了恩根的报告中所包含的诽谤。苏联代表抗议在报告中列入对于伟大的中国人民的诬蔑性谎言。理事会不应该考虑这些谎言。索波列夫强调指出，在中华人民共和国宪法中已经明文规定了目的在保障中国工人、农民和知识分子进行自由劳动的社会、经济和政治方面的一切权利。
    苏联代表强调指出，在经济及社会理事会里讨论这种诽谤性的“材料”只会损害联合国的威信。索波列夫反对社会委员会提出的提案中给予恩根报告以肯定的评价第一点。他说，如果这一点被列入的话，那么苏联代表团将在整个提案表决时弃权。
    经济及社会理事会各会员国的代表十分注意地听取了苏联代表的发言。值得注意的是：理事会中没有一个会员国代表出来支持恩根“报告”里的上述部分。
    理事会通过了社会委员会提出的提案，苏联和捷克斯洛伐克代表在表决时弃权。
