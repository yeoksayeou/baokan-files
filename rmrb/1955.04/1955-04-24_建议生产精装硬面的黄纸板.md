    Suggestion to Produce Hardcover Yellow Cardboard
    To the Editor:
    While the leadership is calling for active measures to conserve grain, we have discovered an alarming case of "unreasonable use of grain" in our publishing work.
    Currently, in order to improve the quality of publications and meet the demands of readers, hardcover books are increasingly common. However, the No. 8 and No. 12 yellow cardboard supplied by paper mills are not suitable for the requirements of publishers (generally No. 16 or No. 24 are used). The solution is to laminate them (two-in-one, or three-in-one). Currently, laminating one thousand sheets of No. 12 (two-in-one) consumes 50 jin of flour, and three-in-one of No. 8 requires 100 jin of flour. Our publishing house alone uses 40 tons of yellow cardboard annually, which is 70,400 sheets if calculated as No. 12. Lamination requires 3,520 jin of flour for one layer and 7,040 jin of flour for two layers. This year, Beijing's publishing houses are estimated to use a total of 500 tons of yellow cardboard, which is 880,000 sheets if calculated as No. 12. Lamination requires 44,000 jin of flour for one layer and 88,000 jin of flour for two layers. This figure is alarming.
    Yellow cardboard that has been laminated absorbs a lot of moisture from the paste during lamination, making it difficult to dry quickly. After binding, the cover of the book is prone to warping and unevenness, often affecting quality. Lamination also incurs additional expenses, which is a waste of manpower and resources.
    To eliminate this waste, we hope that the paper industry will find a way to produce No. 16 and No. 24 yellow cardboard, in order to improve work and conserve grain.

### 建议生产精装硬面的黄纸板

    建议生产精装硬面的黄纸板编辑同志：
    在领导上号召积极采取措施节约粮食的时候，我们发现我们出版工作中有着惊人的“不合理地使用粮食”的事情：
    目前，我们为了提高出版物的质量，满足读者的要求，精装硬面书籍日益增多。但是，造纸厂所供应的八号及十二号黄纸板，均不适合于出版社要求
  （一般均用十六号、二十四号），解决的办法是加工裱糊（二合一，或三合一）。现在裱糊十二号（二合一）一千张，耗费面粉五十市斤，八号三合一，就要面粉一百市斤。我社全年只用四十吨黄纸板，以十二号计，七万另四百张，一裱就要耗费三千五百二十市斤面粉，二裱就要耗费七千零四十市斤面粉。今年北京各出版社以最低的估计全年共用黄纸板五百吨，以十二号计八十八万张，一裱要耗费面粉四万四千市斤，二裱要耗费八万八千市斤面粉，这个数字是很惊人的。
    经过裱糊的黄纸板，由于裱糊时吸收浆糊中的水分很多，一时难以干燥，装订以后，书的封面容易拱起不平，常常影响质量。由于裱糊加工需要增加一笔费用，这从人力物力上说，都是一种浪费。
    为了消除这种浪费现象，希望造纸工业部门设法生产十六号和二十四号黄纸板，以便改进工作和节约粮食。
