Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 3rd. The latest issue of the "New Age" weekly published an editorial stating that the upcoming Asian Countries Conference "is a matter of significant importance in Asian and world affairs." The editorial said that this conference has aroused great interest in Asian countries.

The editorial pointed out that American imperialism is trying its best to launch a war on Asian soil. "But the people of Asian countries no longer feel any fear of these imperialist threats and acts of barbarism. They look forward to the future with confidence. This confidence arises from the great achievements the people of Asian countries have gained in recent times."

The editorial then commented on the agenda of the Asian Countries Conference, saying, "It is extremely important that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are placed at the forefront of the agenda." The editorial pointed out: "The more these principles are supported by the people of all countries, the more the people of all countries demand compliance with these principles, the weaker imperialism will become, the more imperialist conspiracies, military treaties, etc. will be exposed, and the more colonial rule will be condemned."

    印度“新世纪”周报评亚洲国家会议说
    五项原则列在议程首要地位极为重要
    新华社新德里三日电　最近一期的“新世纪”周报发表社论说，即将举行的亚洲国家会议“在亚洲和世界事务中是一件有显著重要意义的事情”。社论说，这个会议已经在亚洲国家中引起了极大的兴趣。
    社论指出，美帝国主义正竭力要在亚洲土地上发动战争。“但是亚洲各国人民不再对这些帝国主义的威胁和蛮横行为感到任何恐惧了。他们满怀信心地瞻望着将来。这种信心是由亚洲各国人民在最近期间获得的巨大成就中产生的。”
    社论接着评论亚洲国家会议的议程说，“和平共处五项原则列在议程的首要地位是极为重要的。”社论指出：“这些原则越得到各国人民的支持，各国人民越要求遵守这些原则，帝国主义就会变得越软弱，帝国主义的阴谋、军事条约等等就会更加暴露，殖民统治就会更加受到谴责。”
