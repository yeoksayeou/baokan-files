As the train carrying the returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army crossed the Yalu River Bridge, it was met with the constant farewells of the heroic Korean people behind and the warm welcome of relatives in the motherland ahead. The triumphant soldiers crowded at the doors of the carriages, excitedly singing the "Chinese People's Volunteer Army Anthem."

The train carried the Fifth Company, which had earned six award banners and the honorary title of "First-Class Merit Company" in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. The commanders, fighters, and Korean people of this company had lived together for nearly four years. They had fought many heroic battles alongside the Korean People's Army, eliminating over 2,600 enemies. Because of their glorious contributions to victory, in the past four years, the entire company produced two first-class merit platoons and 107 meritorious individuals, including one special-class merit holder and second-class hero, and one first-class merit holder and second-class model.

The award banner of "Capable of Offense and Defense, Repeatedly Achieving Extraordinary Merits" marks the glorious deeds of this company in the summer counteroffensive of 1953. In this campaign, they bravely captured the gateway to Mount Jiaoyan – 529.3 Heights, which was heavily fortified by the enemy. To consolidate this height, they fought fiercely for 24 hours, achieving a victory that killed and wounded more than 1,900 enemies. In this battle, Communist Party member Hu Wenjiang used grenades to destroy three enemy bunkers in succession, opening the way for the assault troops. After coordinating with the assault troops to completely annihilate the defending enemy, Hu Wenjiang organized forces to defend the position for more than a day in the face of overwhelming enemy numbers, repelling twelve enemy counterattacks. After the battle, Hu Wenjiang was awarded a special-class merit and the title of second-class hero.

In the past four years, the commanders and fighters of the Fifth Company have forged a deep friendship with the Korean people. In the spring of 1952, when the Fifth Company was digging fortifications on Mount Yuyin, which is more than 1,000 meters above sea level, they discovered more than 1,000 catties of rice that the local people had buried when the American and Li Syngman bandits invaded the North. At that time, the soldiers were eating fried flour, but they braved the artillery fire to return the grain to the local Korean people intact. After the armistice, the soldiers of the Fifth Company also actively participated in helping the Korean people rebuild their homes with the greatest enthusiasm. They helped the people in their garrison area build houses, gather firewood, spring plow, and harvest, and saved more than 500 pieces of clothing to relieve the Korean people. They also participated in the construction of water conservancy projects, building a 2,700-meter-long dam and two canal gates, which could protect more than 360,000 pyeong of local farmland from disasters, guaranteeing an increase of more than 238,000 catties of grain each year. In order to commemorate their deeds forever, the local Korean people erected a monument on the dam engraved with "Korea-China Friendship Dike" and wrote a letter of thanks to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong.

A few days ago, when the Fifth Company was about to withdraw from Korea and return to the motherland, the Korean people from the garrison and nearby areas rushed to the Fifth Company's garrison to say goodbye. Kim Daeniang, who was in her fifties, took her twelve-year-old son, Kim Jin-woong, and said to the soldiers, "You helped us defeat the enemy and helped us repair the dike, eliminating disasters. I will definitely let Jin-woong learn from your example and become a person with noble character like you when he grows up." Female members of the People's Youth League from a certain village hundreds of miles away also worked all night to make a brocade banner embroidered with patterns symbolizing the defense of peace and the construction of the motherland, which they presented to the commanders and fighters of the Fifth Company.

    载誉荣归的英雄连队
    新华社记者　宫铁山
    当载着志愿军归国部队的列车鸣着汽笛驶上鸭绿江大桥的时候，后边是频频招手送别的英雄的朝鲜人民；前边就是热烈欢迎的祖国亲人。凯旋归来的战士们拥在车厢门口，兴奋地唱着“中国人民志愿军战歌”。
    列车载来了在抗美援朝斗争中荣获六面奖旗和“一等功臣连”光荣称号的第五连。这个连的指挥员、战斗员和朝鲜人民共同生活了将近四个年头。他们和朝鲜人民军一起进行过许多次英勇的战斗，消灭过二千六百多个敌人。由于他们对胜利作出了光荣的贡献，近四年来，全连涌现了两个一等功臣班和一百零七名功臣，其中有特等功臣、二级英雄和一等功臣、二级模范各一名。
    “能攻能守、屡建奇功”的奖旗标志着这个连队在一九五三年夏季反击战中的光辉事迹。在这次战役中，他们勇猛地攻下了敌人坚固设防的轿岩山的门户——五二九点三高地，并为巩固这个高地，激战二十四小时，取得了毙伤敌人一千九百多名的胜利。在这次战斗中，共产党员胡文江用手榴弹连续炸毁敌人三个地堡，为突击部队打开了前进的道路。胡文江在配合突击部队全歼守敌后，又在敌众我寡的情况下，组织力量坚守阵地一天多，打退了敌人十二次反扑。战后，胡文江荣立了特等功，获得二级英雄称号。
    近四年来，第五连的指战员们和朝鲜人民结下了深厚的友谊。一九五二年春天，第五连在拔海一千多公尺高的鱼隐山上挖工事时，发现当地人民在美李匪帮向北进犯时埋藏起来的一千多斤大米。那时，战士们吃的是炒面，但他们冒着炮火，把粮食原封不动地送还当地朝鲜人民。停战后，第五连的战士们又怀着最大的热情积极参加了帮助朝鲜人民重建家园的工作。他们帮助驻地人民盖房子、打柴、春耕和秋收，并节省下五百多件衣物救济朝鲜人民。他们还参加了水利工程的修建，修筑了长达二千七百公尺的堤坝和两个水渠闸门，可以使当地三十六万多坪田地免受灾害，保证每年增产粮食二十三万八千多斤。当地朝鲜人民为了永远纪念他们的事迹，在堤坝上建立了一座刻着“朝中亲善堤防”的纪念碑，还向中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席写了一封感谢信。
    前些日子，当第五连即将撤离朝鲜返回祖国时，驻地和附近的朝鲜人民纷纷赶往五连驻地话别。五十多岁的金大娘带着她十二岁的小儿子金镇雄向战士们说：“你们帮助我们打败了敌人，又帮助我们修好水堤、免除了祸害。我一定让镇雄好好学习你们的榜样，长大了也做一个像你们一样有高贵品行的人。”远在百里以外的某里的女民青盟员们也连夜赶制一幅绣着象征保卫和平、建设祖国图样的锦旗，献给了第五连的指战员们。
