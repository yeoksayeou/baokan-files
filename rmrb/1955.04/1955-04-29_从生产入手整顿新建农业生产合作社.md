Rectifying Newly Established Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives Starting with Production
Chen Wen

During the intense spring plowing and sowing season, where should we begin to rectify and consolidate newly established agricultural producers' cooperatives? Should we first resolve the various problems that have already occurred in the new cooperatives and then carry out production, or should we start with production, combine it with production, and gradually resolve problems in all aspects? The rectification and consolidation of the Guangming First Agricultural Production Cooperative (hereinafter referred to as Guangming Cooperative) in Lidou Village, Third Township, Fifth District, Xianyang County, Shaanxi Province, powerfully answers this question: We should start with production.

When the Party branch of this township discussed the work plan for rectifying Guangming Cooperative, there were different opinions on where to start the rectification work.

Guangming Cooperative was established in August 1954. Before its establishment, this village already had thirteen perennial and seasonal mutual aid teams. When the peasants first heard that an agricultural producers' cooperative was to be established here, they had many concerns. Before the cadres sent to establish the cooperative arrived, most of the mutual aid teams had disbanded. However, the cadres sent by the district committee to establish the cooperative did not pay attention to this serious situation, and without conducting thorough ideological education work, they hastily established the cooperative. Of the 83 households in the village, 60 joined the cooperative. A management committee was elected, and a set of regulations was drawn up. All livestock were valued and turned over to the public. Labor and land were compensated at a ratio of 52 percent to 48 percent. The entire cooperative was divided into three production teams and six production groups. After the establishment of the cooperative, they began sowing winter wheat. However, as soon as production work began, problems arose one after another.

Lidou Village is divided into North and South villages. The members of the North Village were very dissatisfied because they had not elected anyone from their village as director, and several peasant households proposed to withdraw from the cooperative. There was disunity between the North and South villages.

The elected director, Yang Bingyan, and deputy director, Ma Tiansheng, also disagreed with each other. The management committee was invisibly divided into two small factions, one supporting the director and the other supporting the deputy director. The two sides suspected each other, deliberately opposed each other, affected the work of the entire cooperative, relaxed leadership over production and financial affairs, and created chaos in the cooperative.

Within each production team, poor peasants and middle peasants were also not united. The team leader and group leader could not direct the team members. No one wanted to do heavy work, and everyone scrambled to do light work. There was no production plan. The work for the day was only arranged temporarily after breakfast. When carts were hitched up, there was no one responsible for driving them. When manure was pulled out, no one knew which field to send it to. No one was responsible for managing farm tools. The rolling poles left in the fields during wheat planting were not collected until the Spring Festival.

More seriously, nine head of livestock died in succession. Of the thirteen *qing* of wheat planted, more than four *qing* had very sparse seedlings, with a seedling deficiency of 40 percent.

Seeing this situation, the members of the cooperative were disheartened. Twenty-six households were wavering, and six of them wanted to withdraw from the cooperative.

At this time, the Xianyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent a work team to rectify the situation. After a preliminary understanding of the situation, the work team reported to the township Party branch; the branch discussed the plan to rectify Guangming Cooperative. At the meeting, some comrades suggested that the work should start with solving the problems of unity, systems, etc., believing that only after these problems were solved could production be carried out smoothly. Another opinion was that it was necessary to start with production. At that time, the members of the cooperative had lost confidence in the cooperative, were pessimistic and disappointed. Only by starting with production and achieving results could the members' emotions be gradually stabilized and their understanding of the superiority of the cooperative be improved; combined with ideological education work, the members' enthusiasm could be raised to rectify all aspects of the cooperative's work. If this was not done, not only would the various problems not be solved at once, but spring plowing would be delayed, causing even more serious consequences. The branch meeting approved the plan to start with production. At that time, the immediate task was to rush manure delivery. There was only one Party member in this village. The work team was responsible for leading the cooperative cadres to implement the resolution of the branch meeting.

The work team first conducted education among the members of the cooperative on immediately grasping production. It repeatedly explained to the members that if the manure could not be delivered to the wheat fields, the wheat yield would be reduced this year, and not only would the national plan not be completed, but every member of the cooperative would also suffer losses. This reasoning was easily accepted by the members. Under the leadership of the management committee of the cooperative, manure delivery was organized, and a contract system was implemented. Originally, no one in the cooperative had calculated how much manure there was or how much land it was enough for. After the delivery of manure began, it was quickly discovered that there was not enough manure, and 350 *mu* of wheat land could not be top-dressed. After discussion among the members, a fertilizer collection campaign was launched throughout the cooperative. Not only was fertilizer prepared for the wheat fields, but also base fertilizer was prepared for the cotton fields. At that time, the weeding of wheat was also checked. None of the thirteen *qing* of land had been weeded. It was necessary to deliver manure and collect fertilizer, and also to weed wheat, and there was a shortage of labor. The women in this village had always lacked the habit of production, and in addition, the previous mutual aid teams had paid them differently for weeding wheat, so the women were even more passive. The work team conducted labor education for the women, and also led the management committee to discuss the standards for contracting work and implement work point scoring. The women were mobilized, and the entire wheat field was weeded in thirteen days.

These significant achievements began to reverse the members' depressed and uneasy emotions, making them see the benefits of collective labor and change their incorrect understanding of the cooperative. On this basis, the work team conducted education on the establishment of the cooperative, analyzed the work situation since the establishment of the cooperative: Last winter, due to the disunity of cadres and members, and the members' lack of concern for the work of the cooperative, 400 *mu* of wheat seedlings were severely deficient, and nine head of livestock died. These two losses amounted to 4,800 yuan, with an average loss of 80 yuan per household. The work team analyzed the actual situation and raised three questions to the members: Why did so many livestock die? Why was the wheat planted so sparsely? Why was there disunity within the cooperative? These were issues that were related to the vital interests of every member. After deliberation and discussion, the members revealed the truth of the matter.

Why did so many livestock die? Some members did not cherish the livestock, only choosing the strong ones to pull carts, and some livestock did not get any rest all day long. Some members beat the livestock every step of the way while driving, breaking a stick after driving one load. The feeding of livestock was careless, and the grass was cut very long. Some livestock died, and when their stomachs were cut open, there were nails in their intestines. Two keepers, Ma Zhiyou and others, stole a large amount of horse feed and fattened the pigs in their own homes. The saying "the cows are crying, the pigs are laughing" had long been circulating among the masses, but no one cared.

Why was the wheat planted so sparsely? It turned out that two members of the management committee of the cooperative had colluded with a production group leader and stolen 600 *jin* of wheat seeds during planting.

Why was there disunity within the cooperative? It turned out that because middle peasants accounted for the majority (eight people) in the management committee, while poor peasants accounted for the minority (five people), they often favored middle peasants when discussing specific issues, causing disunity among the members.

Within the production team, poor peasants and middle peasants also had opinions of each other. Middle peasants looked down on poor peasants, and poor peasants thought middle peasants were backward. The work team combined many actual materials to conduct education on the principle of mutual benefit, and education on the unity of poor peasants and middle peasants. The members made self-criticisms in the teams and groups, further enhancing their awareness and eliminating the gaps.

On the basis of the members' increasing awareness, some middle peasants and poor peasants who had previously firmly demanded to withdraw from the cooperative stood up to expose the destructive activities of Zhao Zhushi, the member of the management committee and accountant of the cooperative. Zhao Zhushi was a landlord who had escaped the net during the land reform. He infiltrated the cooperative, undermined the unity of the members of the North and South villages, deliberately made mistakes in the accounts, and attacked the prestige of the director. Most of the chaotic phenomena mentioned above were related to his destructive activities.

Zhao Zhushi's destructive activities shocked all the members. Zhao Zhushi was sent to the county people's court for legal action. This incident enabled the work team to further clarify the root causes of the various chaotic situations that had occurred in the cooperative in the past, and to use it to educate the members: landlords and rich peasants wanted to pull the peasants back to the capitalist road, and not allow the peasants to take the socialist road under the leadership of the Communist Party; disunity between poor peasants and middle peasants, and disunity among cadres, would facilitate the enemy's destructive activities.

The work team paid attention to discovering and cultivating activists from the beginning of the rectification work, and implemented the class policy of "relying on the poor peasants and firmly uniting the middle peasants." The work team focused on conducting individual education for the poor peasant activists, and explained the Party's policies. For example, before the meeting, they helped them analyze the situation and give advice; at the meeting, they supported their correct opinions, encouraged their work confidence, and cultivated their prestige among the masses; they conducted Party education for them. In this way, the poor peasants, who were previously considered by middle peasants and rich peasants as "unable to manage their own families, how can they manage a cooperative?", grew into the backbone force of the cooperative. The work team successively cultivated 25 activists, and developed one Party member and four members of the Youth League, preparing the conditions for re-electing cooperative cadres and enriching the leadership backbone of the production teams and production groups.

The work team systematically and repeatedly conducted education on the Party's reliance on poor peasants and firm unity of middle peasants for poor peasants and middle peasants, criticized the poor peasants' idea of wanting to take advantage of middle peasants, educated poor peasants to understand that they must unite with middle peasants in order to smash the sabotage of landlords and rich peasant elements, develop production, and smoothly take the socialist road; persuaded poor peasants to implement the principle of mutual benefit, take care of the interests of middle peasants, and consult with middle peasants in case of trouble. They also criticized the middle peasants' erroneous view of looking down on poor peasants, conducted education on the principle of mutual benefit, and raised their understanding and determination to take the socialist road.

After all aspects were ripe, the management committee of the cooperative was re-elected. Before the re-election, the existing cooperative cadres were democratically appraised. First, discussions were held in six groups, and then representatives of each group spoke at the meeting, pointing out the advantages of each management committee member, criticizing them, and proposing which members were not competent. The work team had considered the list of candidates in advance, but did not put it forward, but first launched the groups to deliberate; as a result, the list deliberated by each group was only one person different from the list submitted by the work team to the township branch for research. In the re-elected management committee, there were nine poor peasants and four middle peasants, and five of the original members were not elected. Communist Party member Yang Bingyan made a self-criticism at the democratic appraisal meeting. The masses believed that he had a firm stand, was active in doing things, and had a good heart, but his style was rigid and his attitude was not good, and he should correct it. In this re-election, he was unanimously re-elected as the director of the cooperative.

After rectification, Guangming Cooperative has united the entire cooperative, and production is doing very well in spring plowing. The six households that originally requested to withdraw from the cooperative, after explaining the principle of voluntariness and repeatedly soliciting opinions, expressed their firm determination not to withdraw from the cooperative.

The rectification and consolidation work of Guangming Cooperative powerfully illustrates that only by focusing on production can agricultural producers' cooperatives be truly consolidated. Only when production is done well can the members believe in the superiority of the cooperative, recognize the consistency of the interests of the country, the interests of the cooperative, and the individual interests, be willing to take the socialist road, and improve their enthusiasm and sense of responsibility for running the cooperative well. That is to say, doing a good job in production is the premise for rectifying, consolidating, and developing agricultural producers' cooperatives.

    从生产入手整顿新建农业生产合作社
    陈文
    在紧张的春耕播种期间，整顿和巩固新建的农业生产合作社，应当从何处入手？究竟是先解决了新社所已经发生的各种问题，然后开展生产呢，还是从生产着手，结合生产，逐步解决各方面的问题呢？陕西省咸阳县第五区第三乡李窦村光明第一农业生产合作社（以下简称光明社）的整顿和巩固的情形，有力地回答了这个问题：应该从生产入手。
    这个乡的党支部大会讨论整顿光明社的工作计划的时候，对于从何处入手进行整顿工作，有过不同的意见。
    光明社是在一九五四年八月建立的。建社以前，这个村已有了十三个常年的和季节性的互助组。农民们最初听说这里要建立农业生产合作社，顾虑很多，没等到建社的干部到来，大部分互助组都散了伙。可是，区委派来建社的干部，却没有理会这种严重的情况，没有进行深入的思想教育工作，仓仓促促地把社建立起来了。全村八十三户，入社的就有六十户。选出了社的管理委员会，订了一套规章。牲口全部折价归公。劳力和土地的报酬是百分之五十二比百分之四十八。全社编成三个生产队，六个生产组。建社以后，就开始播种冬麦。可是，生产工作刚迈步，问题一个接一个出来了。
    李窦村分南北两村，北村社员由于没有选上自己村里的人当主任，很不满意，好几户农民提出要退社。南北两村闹不团结。
    当选的主任杨秉彦和副主任马天升也闹意见。管理委员会无形中分成了两个小集团，一派是拥护主任的，一派是拥护副主任的；两方面互相猜忌，故意作对，影响了全社的工作，放松了对生产、财务各方面工作的领导，造成社里的混乱状况。
    每个生产队里，贫农同中农也不团结。队长组长指挥不了组员。重活没人干，轻活抢着干。生产无计划，当天的活，早饭以后才临时安排。套起了车，没有负责赶车的人；拉出了粪，不知道往那块地里送；农具没人负责经管，种麦的时候扔在地里的碾杆，到春节还没人往回收。
    更严重的是，接连死了九头牲口。种了十三顷小麦有四顷多麦苗很稀，缺苗百分之四十。
    社员看到这种情况，都寒了心，二十六户动摇了，其中有六户要退社。
    这时候，中共咸阳县委派了一个工作组去整顿。工作组初步了解了情况以后，就向乡支部大会做了汇报；支部大会讨论了整顿光明社的计划。会上，有的同志提出应该先从解决团结问题、制度问题等等着手，认为只有这些问题解决了，才可能顺利进行生产。另一种意见是必须先从生产入手。当时，社员已丧失对社的信心，悲观失望，只有从生产入手，做出成绩来，才能逐步稳定社员情绪，提高社员对社的优越性的认识；再结合思想教育工作，提高社员的积极性，来整顿社的各方面的工作。要不这样做，各种问题不但不可能一下求得解决，并且会误了春耕生产，造成更严重的后果。支部大会通过了先从生产入手的计划。当时首先要突击送粪。这个村只有一个党员，支部大会的决议，由工作组负责领导社干部去执行。
    工作组先在社员中进行了立即抓紧生产的教育。反复向社员说明：如果不能把粪送到麦地，今年麦子减了产，不但完不成国家的计划，每一个社员也都要遭到损失。这个道理很容易被社员所接受。在社的管理委员会领导下，组织了送粪，实行了包工制。原先，社里究竟有多少粪，够上多少地，谁也没有算过。送粪开始以后，很快就发现了粪不够，有三百五十亩麦地不能上追肥。经过社员的讨论，全社开展了搜集肥料运动。不但准备好麦田的肥料，并且准备了棉田的底肥。当时，又检查了锄麦的情况，十三顷地都还没有锄，要送粪集肥，又要锄麦，劳力不足。这个村里的妇女向来缺乏生产习惯，加上以前的互助组组织妇女锄麦时同工不同酬，妇女更加消极。工作组对妇女进行了劳动教育，又领导管理委员会讨论了包工的标准，实行记工评分。妇女发动起来了，十三天，把全部麦田锄了一遍。
    这些显著的成绩开始扭转了社员消沉不安的情绪，使他们看到了集体劳动的好处，改变了对社的不正确的认识；工作组就在这个基础上，进行了建社的教育，分析了建社以来的工作情况：去年冬季，由于干部、社员闹不团结，社员对社的工作不关心，四百亩麦苗严重缺苗，死了九头牲口，这两项损失就有四千八百元，每户社员平均损失八十元。工作组分析了实际情况，向社员提出了三个问题：牲口为什么死的那么多？麦子为什么种的那么稀？社内为什么心不齐？这是关系到每一个社员切身利害的问题。社员经过酝酿、讨论，把问题的真相全部揭发出来。
    牲口为什么死的那么多？有些社员不爱护牲口，只挑硬实的套车，有的牲口整天不得休息。有的社员赶车的时候，走一步打一下牲口，赶了一趟车，打断了一根棍子。喂养牲口不经心，草切得很长。有的牲口死了，剖开肚子，肠胃里有钉子。马志友等两个饲养员，大量偷马料，喂肥了自己家里的猪。群众中早就流传着“牛哭呢，猪笑呢”的话，可是没人管。
    麦为什么种的那么稀？原来是有两个社的管理委员会委员，串通了一个生产组长，在种麦的时候偷了六百斤麦种。
    社内为什么心不齐呢？原来是因为管理委员会中中农占多数（八人），贫农占少数（五人），在讨论具体问题的时候，常常偏向中农，造成了社员不团结的现象。
    生产队里，贫农中农也互有意见。中农瞧不起贫农，贫农认为中农落后。工作组结合许多实际材料，进行了互利原则的教育，贫农中农团结的教育，社员们在队里组里进行了检讨，进一步提高了社员的觉悟，消除了隔阂。
    在社员觉悟日益提高的基础上，有些过去坚决要求退社的中农和贫农起来揭发了社的管理委员会委员兼会计赵柱石的破坏活动。赵柱石是在土地改革时漏网的地主，他钻到社里，破坏南北两村社员的团结，故意弄错账目，打击主任的威信，……上边说的那些混乱现象，多数和他的破坏活动有关系。
    赵柱石的破坏活动震动了全体社员。赵柱石被送到县人民法院法办了。这件事使工作组进一步摸清楚了过去社里发生的各种混乱情况的根底，并用来教育社员：地主富农要把农民拉回资本主义的道路，不让农民在共产党的领导下走社会主义的道路；贫农中农不团结，干部不团结，都会便利敌人进行破坏活动。
     工作组开始进行整顿工作，就注意了发现和培养积极分子，贯彻“依靠贫农，巩固地团结中农”的阶级政策。工作组着重对贫农积极分子进行个别教育，交代党的政策。比如在开会以前，帮助他们分析情况和出主意；在会上，支持他们正确的意见，鼓励他们的工作信心，培养他们在群众中的威信；对他们进行了党的教育。这样，以前被中农富农认为“自己家都管不了，还能管个社？”的贫农，就成长为社的骨干力量。工作组先后培养了二十五个积极分子，并发展了一个党员、四个团员，为改选社干部、充实生产队和生产组的领导骨干准备了条件。
    工作组有计划地反复地对贫农和中农进行了党依靠贫农、巩固地团结中农的教育，批判了贫农中想占中农便宜的思想，教育贫农懂得必须团结中农，才能粉碎地主富农分子的破坏，发展生产，顺利地走社会主义的道路；说服贫农要贯彻互利原则，照顾中农利益，遇事同中农商量。也批判了中农瞧不起贫农的错误看法，进行互利原则的教育，提高他们走社会主义道路的认识和决心。
    各方面条件成熟之后，就来改选社的管理委员会。改选之前，对原有的社干部进行了民主鉴定。先在六个小组里讨论，再由各组代表在大会上发言，他们对于每个管理委员会委员指出了优点，进行了批评，并提出那些委员不称职。工作组事先考虑了候选名单，但是没有提出来，而是首先发动小组进行酝酿；结果，各小组酝酿的名单，同工作组提交乡支部研究的名单，只有一个人不一样。改选后的管理委员会中，有贫农九个，中农四个，原来的委员有五个没有当选。共产党员杨秉彦，在民主鉴定会上作了自我检讨，群众认为他立场稳，办事积极，心地好，就是作风生硬，态度不好，应该改正。这次改选中，他以全票继续当选为社主任。
    光明社经过整顿，全社已经团结起来，在春耕中，生产搞得很好；原先要求退社的六户，经过讲明自愿原则，再三征求意见，他们表示坚决不退社了。
      光明社的整顿和巩固工作，有力地说明了只有围绕生产，才能真正巩固农业生产合作社。只有生产搞好了，才可能使社员相信社的优越性，认识国家的利益、社的利益、个人利益的一致性，乐于走社会主义的道路，提高办好社的积极性和责任心。这就是说搞好生产，是整顿、巩固和发展农业生产合作社的前提。
