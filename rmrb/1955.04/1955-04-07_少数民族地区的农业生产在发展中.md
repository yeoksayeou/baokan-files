Agricultural Production in Minority Areas is Developing
    Ma Kaidian

    China has several dozen minority ethnic groups with a population of over 35 million. The vast lands inhabited by these ethnic groups generally have favorable natural conditions suitable for developing agricultural production, yielding a wide variety of agricultural products. Xinjiang Province currently has just over 20 million mu of arable land; if existing water sources are fully utilized, it could irrigate 100 million mu of wasteland. Guangxi and Yunnan, with larger minority populations, are located in subtropical zones with abundant rainfall and large areas of barren mountains and land, suitable for large-scale cultivation of various economically valuable subtropical and tropical crops. China's rare crops, such as oil plants like coconut and oil palm, industrial raw material plants like sisal and Manila hemp, medicinal plants like cinchona, beverages and condiments like coffee and pepper, spice plants like lemongrass, and fruits like pineapple, mango, and citrus, also mostly grow in the southern minority areas.

    Although minority areas have such favorable natural conditions, due to the cruel oppression and exploitation by reactionary ruling classes throughout history, agricultural production in most areas is backward. Before liberation and in the early post-liberation period, some areas lacked even simple iron farm tools, so that many places still maintained primitive "slash-and-burn" cultivation methods. In He Fa Township, Congjiang County, Guizhou, out of more than 700 households, there were only 15 iron-toothed rakes, and primitive wooden and stone rakes were still commonly used production tools. In a village in Yuanyang County, Honghe Hani Autonomous Region, Yunnan, an average of more than twenty households shared one draught animal, and more than ten households raised one pig. In the context of extremely backward agricultural production, the minority peoples lived a very poor life. The Yao people in the Shiwan mountains of Guangxi and the Dong people in the Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County of Guangxi almost always relied on eating cassava and fern roots to survive. A folk song circulating among the Miao people of Guangxi poignantly recounts the tragic life of the Miao people before liberation: "Living in the Miao mountains! Living in poverty eating fern root, farming thin fields in the mountains! Plowing the fields year after year with wooden rakes!"

    In order to help the various minority ethnic groups develop agricultural production, from 1950 to 1953, the state issued various agricultural loans (including forestry equipment costs in individual regions and individual years) totaling 122.36 million yuan (old currency) in Xinjiang Province, Gansu Province, and various minority areas in Southwest and Central South China. In ten minority-populated counties in Guizhou Province, such as Danzhai and Leishan, the loans issued in 1953 alone helped farmers of various ethnic groups purchase 5,000 head of cattle, 20,000 pigs, 53,000 farm tools, and more than 630,000 jin of fertilizer. Many farmers in the Xihai Gu Hui Autonomous Region of Gansu Province actively improved the soil by spreading sand after purchasing farm tools with loans, increasing grain yields several times over. The government also provided large amounts of iron farm tools free of charge to those minority areas that extremely lacked iron farm tools and where people lived in extreme poverty. In Southwest minority areas alone (excluding Tibet and Qamdo region), in 1953, more than 1.3 million pieces of iron farm tools worth 40.8 billion yuan were distributed; in 1954, iron farm tools worth 38 billion yuan were distributed. This helped minority farmers improve their production conditions. Li Yucai, a Hui farmer in Galixiang, Fifth District, Weining County, Guizhou Province, carefully cultivated his land using iron farm tools in 1953, and harvested 1,400 jin of corn on land where he could not even recover the seeds before, earning the glorious title of bumper harvest household. His wife happily said, "This is the bumper harvest that Chairman Mao brought to our family!" Whenever natural disasters occurred, people's governments at all levels also issued various relief funds to help the various ethnic groups engage in production for self-relief. According to incomplete statistics, from 1950 to 1953, the Southwest region issued 37.4 billion yuan in relief funds, 39.7 billion yuan in special winter clothing funds, and 30 million jin of relief grain.

    Since liberation, state-owned commercial departments in minority areas have purchased agricultural products and native products at reasonable prices and supplied the various ethnic groups with large amounts of means of production and means of livelihood, powerfully promoting the development of agricultural production. In the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region, from 1951 to 1953 alone, the amount of tung oil, gallnut, edible oil, and other native products purchased reached 67.9 billion yuan. Before liberation, in this area, one hundred jin of tung seeds could only be exchanged for forty-nine jin of salt, but after liberation, they could be exchanged for one hundred and ten jin of salt. In Xinjiang Province, before liberation, buying one bolt of cloth required more than 1,794 jin of wheat, but after liberation, only 216 jin were needed.

    In recent years, the state has selectively established some state-owned farms, demonstration farms, and technology extension stations in minority areas. According to incomplete statistics in 1953, 292 agricultural institutions of various types were established in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Xinjiang Province, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region, Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and Southwest minority areas alone. These institutions have played a certain role in demonstration and technical guidance.

    Mutual aid and cooperation organizations in minority areas have also been steadily developing in recent years. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, where the mutual aid and cooperation movement has developed rapidly, by the end of January of this year, the number of agricultural production cooperatives had increased to more than 3,900. In Guizhou, 64 Miao agricultural production cooperatives have been established in only four Miao autonomous counties at the county level, such as Taijiang, Danzhai, Leishan, and Lushan; in areas where Hui people live scattered in Hebei, Shandong, and other provinces, many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams jointly formed by Han and Hui farmers have also emerged. The gradual development of mutual aid and cooperation has provided favorable conditions for the promotion of new farm tools and the further improvement of production technology. In the eastern administrative region of the former Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, according to incomplete statistics from 1952 and 1953 alone, 12,969 pieces of various new farm tools were promoted. In Xinjiang Province, after 1953, ordinary farmers could generally cultivate the land at least three times before sowing, strip sowing was widely promoted, and inter-tillage and weeding, summer plowing, and autumn turning were carried out in some areas, and the area of fertilization was also expanding year by year. In this way, many areas have begun to change the habit of extensive planting and low yield and increase the yield per unit area.

    This series of changes in agricultural production in minority areas is centrally reflected in the year-by-year increase in agricultural output. In 1953, the grain output of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region exceeded the highest pre-liberation annual output by 25 percent. The grain output of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in 1953 exceeded that before liberation by 30 percent. The whole region was still short of more than 5 million jin of grain in 1951, but in 1953, there was a surplus of more than 442.2 million jin of grain to supply to other regions. In 1953, the grain output of Xinjiang Province increased by 1 billion jin compared with 1949. Yanqi Prefecture in Xinjiang Province often lacked grain, and the 150,000 people of various ethnic groups in the region used to live very poorly. Many people relied on collecting sand dates, grass roots, and fishing to maintain their lives all year round. After 1951, the whole region not only achieved grain self-sufficiency, but also had a surplus of grain. In 1954, the tea output of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan was five and a half times that of 1949, and the tea output of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture increased by 21 percent compared with 1953. With the gradual development of production, the lives of the minority peoples have also greatly improved.

    少数民族地区的农业生产在发展中
    马开典
    我国有着拥有三千五百多万人口的几十个少数民族。在各少数民族居住着的辽阔的土地上，一般都有着适宜发展农业生产的良好的自然条件，出产着种类繁多的农产品。新疆省现有耕地面积不过两千多万亩；如果把现有的水源充分利用起来，就可灌溉荒地一亿亩。少数民族人口较多的广西和云南，地处亚热带，雨量充沛，且有大片荒山荒地，适宜大量种植各种经济价值较高的亚热带和热带作物。我国的稀有作物，如油料植物椰子、油棕，工业原料植物剑麻、蕉麻、橡胶树，药用植物金鸡纳树，饮料和调味用的咖啡、胡椒，香料植物香芧和水果菠萝、芒果、柑桔等，也多生长在南方各少数民族地区。
    少数民族地区虽然有着这样良好的自然条件，但由于历代反动统治阶级的残酷压迫和剥削，大多数地区的农业生产是落后的。在解放前和解放后初期，某些地区连简单的铁制农具都非常缺乏，以致不少地方还保持着“刀耕火种”的原始耕作方法。贵州从江县合法乡七百多户人家，只有十五件铁齿耙，原始的木耙和石耙，还是他们普遍使用的生产工具。云南红河哈尼族自治区元阳县一个村庄，平均二十几户人家才有一头耕牛，十几户人家才养一口猪。在农业生产极端落后的情况下，少数民族人民过着非常贫苦的生活。广西十万大山的傜族人民和三江县侗族自治区的侗族人民，差不多常年靠吃木薯、蕨根过活。广西苗族人民中流传的一首歌谣，沉痛地倾诉了苗族人民解放前的悲惨生活：“苗岭山上住苗家哟！生活贫苦吃蕨粑，山间耕种瘦田地哟！年年翻犁田土用木耙！”
    为了帮助各少数民族发展农业生产。从一九五○年到一九五三年，国家在新疆省、甘肃省以及西南、中南各少数民族地区，发放了各种农业贷款
  （包括个别地区个别年份的林业设备费）一亿二千二百三十六万元（旧币，下同）。在贵州省丹寨、雷山等十个少数民族聚居县，仅一九五三年发放的贷款就帮助各族农民购买了耕牛五千头、猪两万只、农具五万三千件、肥料六十三万多斤。甘肃西海固回族自治区的许多农民，用贷款购买了农具后，即积极铺砂改良土壤，使粮食产量增加了数倍。政府在那些极端缺乏铁制农具、人民生活非常困苦的少数民族地区，无偿地发放了大量的铁制农具。仅西南各少数民族地区（不包括西藏和昌都地区）一九五三年即发放了价值四百零八亿元的铁制农具一百三十余万件；一九五四年又发放了价值三百八十亿元的铁制农具。这样就帮助少数民族农民改善了生产条件。贵州省威宁县第五区戛利乡回族农民李玉才，一九五三年使用铁制农具精耕细作，在以前连种子都收不回来的土地上，收了一千四百斤玉米，获得了丰产户的光荣称号。他的妻子欢喜地说：“这是毛主席给我家带来的丰收！”每当发生自然灾害的时候，各级人民政府还发放各种救济款，帮助各族人民生产自救。据不完全的统计，西南地区一九五○年至一九五三年即发放了救济款三百七十四亿元、寒衣专款三百九十七亿元、救济粮三千万斤。
    解放以来，少数民族地区的国营商业部门用合理价格收购农产品和土特产品，供应各族人民大量生产资料和生活资料，有力地促进了农业生产的发展。在湘西苗族自治区，自一九五一年至一九五三年，仅收购桐油、五倍子、食油等三种土产的金额即达六百七十九亿元。解放前，在这个地区，一百斤桐子只能换四十九斤盐，解放后就能换一百一十斤盐。新疆省解放前买一疋布需要小麦一千七百九十四斤多，解放后只需要二百一十六斤就够了。
    几年来，国家已在少数民族地区有重点地建立了一些国营农场、示范农场和技术推广站。据一九五三年的不完全统计，仅在内蒙古自治区、新疆省、湘西苗族自治区、桂西僮族自治区和西南各少数民族地区，就建立了各种农业机构二百九十二处。这些机构发挥了一定的示范和技术指导的作用。
    少数民族地区的互助合作组织，几年来也在稳步地发展着。互助合作运动发展较快的内蒙古自治区，到今年一月底，农业生产合作社已增加到三千九百多个。贵州仅台江、丹寨、雷山、炉山等四个县级苗族自治区，就已成立了六十四个苗族农业生产合作社；在河北、山东等回民散居地区还出现了不少汉、回两族农民联合组成的农业生产合作社和互助组。互助合作的逐步发展，给新式农具的推广和生产技术的进一步改进，提供了有利条件。在原内蒙古自治区的东部行政区，仅据一九五二和一九五三两年的不完全统计，即推广了各种新式农具一万二千九百六十九件。在新疆省，一九五三年以后，一般农民已能在播种前至少整地三次，普遍推行了条播，部分地区还进行了中耕除草、伏耕秋翻，施肥面积也逐年扩大。这样，就使不少地区开始改变了广种薄收的习惯，提高了单位面积产量。
    少数民族地区农业生产上的这一系列的变化，集中地表现在农业产量的逐年增加上面。一九五三年，内蒙古自治区的粮食产量已超过解放前最高年产量百分之二十五。广西僮族自治区一九五三年的粮食产量已超过解放前百分之三十，全区一九五一年尚缺粮五百多万斤，而一九五三年就已有四亿四千二百多万斤余粮供应外区。一九五三年新疆省的粮食产量较一九四九年增加了十亿斤。新疆省焉耆专区经常缺粮，全区十五万各族人民，过去生活非常困苦，许多人终年靠采集沙枣、草根和捕鱼维持生活，一九五一年以后，全区不但达到粮食自给，而且有了余粮。一九五四年，云南德宏傣族景颇族自治区的茶叶产量为一九四九年的五倍半，西双版纳傣族自治区的茶叶产量比一九五三年增加了百分之二十一。少数民族人民生产的逐年发展，生活也有了很大的改善。
