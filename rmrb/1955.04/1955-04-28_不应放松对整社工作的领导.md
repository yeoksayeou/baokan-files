    Leadership Over Rectification of Cooperatives Should Not Be Relaxed
    In late March of this year, the CPC Tianjin District Committee dispatched six cadres to six counties, including Ninghe and Wuqing, to inspect the work of rectifying agricultural production cooperatives. After inspection, it was found that five out of fifty-two cooperatives had not yet formulated production plans; many cooperatives, although they had formulated plans, lacked specific methods for increasing production. Many cooperatives had chaotic organization and use of labor. Preparations for spring plowing were also poorly done. Eight out of eighteen cooperatives in Qingxian and Ninghe counties lacked 80% of the seeds, and members lacked confidence in increasing production.
    Why do these cooperatives have so many problems? This is mainly due to the serious complacency among leading cadres in various counties. They believe that rectification work was done when the cooperatives were established in 1954, and there are not many problems, so they relaxed specific leadership over the work of rectification. In two months, only three members of the Daicheng County Committee had gone deep into agricultural production cooperatives. The Jiuzhangtun Township in Qingxian County is the key township for the County Committee's rectification work, although four cadres worked in this township for more than ten days, they did not help the cooperative formulate a practical production plan.
    In response to this situation, the CPC Tianjin District Committee instructed all counties to strengthen specific leadership over the work of rectification and earnestly achieve "the secretary takes action, the whole party runs the cooperatives," and earnestly overcome complacency among cadres. The instructions also emphasized that rectification must start with production, and by implementing the "three fix" policy, the enthusiasm of members for production and running the cooperatives should be improved; and in the rectification, attention should be paid to relying on grassroots organizations and giving play to the role of Party members, League members, and activists.

    不应放松对整社工作的领导
    今年三月下旬，中共天津地委派出六名干部，分别到宁河、武清等六个县检查整顿农业生产合作社的工作。经过检查，发现五十二个社中有五个社还没有制定生产计划；许多社虽然制定了计划，但却没有具体的增产方法。许多社对劳动力的组织和使用很混乱。春耕生产的准备工作也都做得不好。青县、宁河县两县的十八个社中有八个社还缺少百分之八十的种子，社员们对增产缺乏信心。
    为什么这些社存在这么多问题呢？这主要是由于各县的领导干部存在着严重的骄傲自满情绪。他们认为一九五四年建社时已经做了整顿工作，已没有多少问题，因而放松了对整社工作的具体领导。大城县委在两个月的时间内，只有三个县委委员深入过农业生产合作社。青县旧张屯乡是县委整社重点乡，虽然有四个干部在这乡工作了十多天，但没有帮助社制定出一个切实可行的生产计划。
    中共天津地委针对这一情况，指示各县必须加强对整社工作的具体领导，切实做到“书记动手，全党办社”，切实克服干部中的骄傲自满情绪。指示中还强调整社必须从生产入手，通过贯彻“三定”政策，提高社员生产和办社的积极性；并在整社中要注意依靠基层组织，发挥党员、团员和积极分子的作用。　（怀仁、炳昕）
