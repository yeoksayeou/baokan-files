Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 7th: North Korean "Rodong Sinmun" and "Minju Choson" published editorials on the 6th, congratulating the opening of the Asian Countries Conference.

    The "Rodong Sinmun" editorial said that the convening of the Asian Countries Conference will help to maintain and consolidate peace in Asia, promote friendship among the Asian people, and ease international tensions. The Korean people, together with the people of Asian countries, warmly welcome the convening of this conference and sincerely expect it to achieve important results.
    The editorial pointed out that the continued deepening of tensions in Asia and the threat to peace are entirely caused by the US imperialists' implementation of an aggressive "policy of strength." It is the primary task of the Asian people to not allow imperialism to wage war in Asia and to defend the independent and autonomous rights of the Asian people.
    The "Minju Choson" editorial said: "The Asian Countries Conference is a historic conference that demonstrates the Asian people's demand for peace and reflects the will and unity of the Asian countries' people for friendly cooperation."
    The editorial pointed out that the inclusion of the discussion of the peaceful reunification of Korea issue on the agenda of the Asian Countries Conference clearly reflects the unanimous demand of the peace-loving people in Asia and the world, who all hope for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The Korean people are newly encouraged by the support given to them by the peace-loving people of Asia.
Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 7th: The Indian "National Herald" published an editorial on the 5th, commenting on the Asian Countries Conference held in New Delhi from April 6th to 10th.

    The editorial said that the Asian Countries Conference is completely different from the Bandung Conference in terms of the identity of the initiators. However, both conferences share the same spirit and goals. The editorial said that the enthusiastic response of various countries to the proposal to convene the Asian Countries Conference is the best answer to the scoffers and obstructers of the conference.
    Referring to the issues to be considered at this conference, the editorial pointed out that the conference will discuss issues of common concern, including political, economic, scientific, social, and cultural aspects. Economic issues include the development of trade relations between Asian countries and the general economic development of the entire Asian region.
Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 6th: Czechoslovak newspapers published commentaries on the 6th, welcoming the Asian Countries Conference.

    "Rude Pravo" said that the discussion of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence at the Asian Countries Conference will greatly contribute to strengthening and further expanding the unity among Asian countries to promote peace and security in the region.
    The commentary in "Prace" pointed out the interrelationship of the people of all countries in the struggle for freedom, saying: We support the Asian countries fighting for freedom, because their freedom means the consolidation of our freedom, the weakening of aggressive imperialism, and a contribution to the cause of peace.
Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 7th: The German "Daily Review" commented on the Asian Countries Conference on the 6th, saying that the Asian people are protesting against the US-led imperialist aggressor forces' attempt to implement aggression plans in Asia, and they have gathered together to jointly discuss steps to ease international tensions.
    The commentary said: Important Asian countries such as the People's Republic of China, India, and Burma have already united in a friendly manner through the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The conference currently being held in New Delhi will discuss how to make the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence a reality in other parts of Asia.
    The commentary concluded that this conference is a manifestation of the Asian people's determination to defend national independence, and it will give new inspiration to people in stopping aggression.
Xinhua News Agency, April 7th: According to the Romanian News Agency Bucharest: The Romanian "Scînteia" published a commentary on the 6th, welcoming the opening of the Asian Countries Conference in New Delhi. The commentary said that the Asian Countries Conference is in line with the wishes of the people of Asian countries and will discuss various major issues to promote the cause of peace.
    The commentary pointed out that the growing struggle in Asian countries has so far prevented the US imperialists from pulling the major countries of Southeast Asia into the aggressive Manila Treaty Organization. Even Dulles himself admitted that he "came back with some ominous premonitions" after his recent activities in Asia. The people of Asian countries strengthened his premonition.
    Emphasizing the breadth of this conference, the commentary pointed out that inspiring preparations have been made in almost all Asian countries. Hundreds of millions of peace advocates around the world are watching this conference and are deeply convinced that the discussions and decisions at the conference will make significant contributions to the cause of easing international tensions, to the growth of peace forces, and to the fight against the conspiracies of the enemies of peace and national independence.
