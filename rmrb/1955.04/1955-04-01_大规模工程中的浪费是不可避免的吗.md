Is Waste Inevitable in Large-Scale Projects?
By our staff reporter Zhang Jianhong

The construction engineering unit undertaking the construction of China's first tractor factory achieved successes in winter construction last year. They exceeded the 1954 plan for building permanent dormitories for employees, given continuously increasing tasks and a very short timeframe. However, this construction engineering unit neglected frugality in this work, resulting in serious waste of national construction funds.

Let's look at these accounts: The timber processing plant of the Production Management Department wasted timber worth more than 2 billion yuan (old currency, same below) due to poor planning and using good timber for inferior purposes. The Materials Supply Department blindly purchased rice straw mats, resulting in stockpiling and a loss of 2.00962 billion yuan. The 102nd Engineering Zone wasted 561 million yuan during winter construction. These are the items that can be accounted for. In addition, there is a bottomless pit that has not yet been accurately calculated – this is the material yard managed by the Materials Supply Department.

If you take a walk through this material yard, you can see high piles of cement, steel bars, and white, powdery lime like a long embankment, all stored in the open air. These building materials have been exposed to wind and rain, sun and night dew for a long time, and most of them have been disfigured. Hundreds of tons of steel bars have rusted, and the part of more than 5,000 tons of cement near the ground has begun to solidify. 452 tons of lime are missing, and the rest has all deteriorated. The original factory acceptance was 28 pieces of ash, and every 600 kilograms could dissolve one cubic meter of water and ash, but now it takes more than 1,200 kilograms to dissolve one cubic meter. The utilization rate has been reduced by more than half.

The waste in this material yard is alarming. The management is very chaotic. The loss of logs transported from afar due to careless pulling of stakes during unloading, rolling and spilling, and mutual collision and breakage is as high as more than 30 logs per railway car, and as low as seven or eight. After the logs were broken, they had to be used for smaller purposes or became waste. Bricks, stones, lime, and sand purchased from various places were stacked layer upon layer, until it was impossible to tell which was lime and which was sand. From the time the bricks were shipped from the place of origin to the time they were put into the warehouse, after many bumps and collisions, the number of discarded and missing corners reached nearly 50%. The steel bars transported from other places were pulled away by trucks from the construction site before the materials department had even weighed them. The purchasers unloaded the materials from the train on the side of the railway and left them unattended. Two months later, a cadre from the Materials Supply Department passed by and discovered that this pile of materials belonged to them. As for the strange phenomena such as well-bundled bamboo strips being thrown and bundled again during unloading, paper bags for cement being broken and repackaged, and the numbers of goods unloaded from the trucks being small while the numbers on the delivery notes being large, are everywhere.

Last November, the superior Party committee of the tractor factory site and the local municipal Party committee sent personnel to inspect the work of this material yard. They estimated that the daily loss here was worth about 20 million to 30 million yuan. Subsequently, the Party committee of the construction engineering unit undertaking the construction of the tractor factory also instructed the Discipline Inspection Section and the Investigation and Research Section to conduct an inspection of this material yard. According to their rough estimates, the loss figures for the period from September to November were: 211.13 million yuan in fines imposed by the railway authorities for empty railway cars due to vehicles being dispatched to purchase goods but failing to load them due to poor planning; 445.92 million yuan in extra expenditure due to blindly purchasing goods at high prices without understanding the source of goods; 279.95 million yuan in processing fees for reorganizing the chaotic stacking of goods on site; 375 million yuan in timber losses; and more than 240 million yuan in losses of green and red bricks. There were also many cases of bringing more money to buy less goods and stagnation of funds. Once, when buying cement in the Northeast, the goods were only worth 100 million yuan, but because they had no idea, they brought 500 million yuan, which affected the temporary turnover of funds.

However, the serious waste and shortcomings in the work revealed in the various inspections by the Party committee did not arouse the vigilance of the relevant leading comrades of the construction engineering unit. When the superior Party committee came to this material yard to mobilize against waste, Wang Xinting, deputy director of the Materials Supply Department, stated that there was waste in the material yard, but there were many objective reasons, and we should not bear the main responsibility. Although he verbally said to everyone, "I am responsible for the waste," he actually used this to close the door to criticism and self-criticism. Since then, he has not been willing for people to raise the issue of waste at the meeting, saying that it is "sowing discord, deliberately finding fault, and looking for shortcomings." Therefore, some Party members in the Materials Supply Department reflected, "We dare not speak anymore. The political atmosphere here is too thin, and the Party's instructions cannot be effectively implemented." Recently, in the inventory and asset verification in the various sections of the Materials Supply Department, it was found that there were 361 cubic meters more logs than on the books, more than 24,000 more tiles, and more than 210 cubic meters more pebbles. Wang Xinting did not inspect this situation, which obviously reflected the chaos in the materials work, but instead was complacent, believing that the waste in the material yard was just a "misunderstanding" of the people. Due to this arrogant and complacent mood of the leadership of the Materials Supply Department, on the one hand, it hindered them from sincerely accepting criticism from all sides and reviewing the subjective reasons for the waste based on the spirit of the Party committee's inspection work; on the other hand, they excessively emphasized objective difficulties and relaxed their own efforts to overcome waste and improve work. Therefore, until now, apart from building a few more reed sheds and determining the cargo positions, there has been no fundamental improvement in management in this material yard. When the wind blows, the lime whirls around in a radius of three or four miles like a thick fog, the cement continues to deteriorate, and the steel bars are still rusting.

The superior leading organ of the Materials Supply Department—the construction unit undertaking the construction of the tractor factory—bears important responsibility for the waste and chaos in this material yard. Since the start of construction, they have not earnestly implemented the spirit of frugality. They treated anti-waste as a gust of wind. After making some verbal mobilization, they did not strictly urge the cadres of this material yard to take the necessary measures to effectively overcome waste. Last October, the responsible comrade of the superior Construction Engineering Bureau, based on practical experience, made a report to them on frugality in engineering, pointing out that if they implemented planned management, promoted advanced labor quotas, carried out economic accounting, and made more plans, and implemented the most economical one. In this way, it is entirely possible to save the country two to three hundred billion yuan. If the opposite is true, it is also possible to easily waste two to three hundred billion yuan. However, the comrades in this material yard did not study these opinions well, but instead intentionally or unintentionally adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards various wastes in their work. Someone once reported the waste situation in this material yard to Comrade Gu Zhun, one of the leaders of the construction engineering unit, but he said:
  "Don't rush to criticize, so as not to affect the work mood." He also admitted that the waste in the material yard was appalling and a mess, but he did not advocate in-depth ideological examination. The anti-waste wave that was about to be set off in this material yard calmed down again. When the cadres constantly reflected on the serious waste, Comrade Gu Zhun always believed that: "Waste is inevitable in large-scale projects, and it is not worth making a fuss about." "There are many additional tasks during winter construction, and there is no time for increasing production and practicing economy."

Whether waste in large-scale projects can be avoided depends mainly on how we understand the relationship between completing construction tasks and saving money, whether we regard them as a whole or treat them as opposing each other. Obviously, the larger the scale of the project and the more the state invests, the greater the loss caused by a little waste. Therefore, in large-scale construction projects, it is not a question of whether waste can be avoided, but that waste must be avoided, and it is not that there is no time for increasing production and practicing economy, but that the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy must be implemented. Recently, the construction site planned to buy 1,000 kilograms of alum red for painting walls, but mistakenly wrote it as valuable paint material Xihong. When the comrades in the purchasing section of the Materials Supply Department saw it, they felt that according to the current project, there would never be a need for so much Xihong, and finally corrected the mistake, avoiding more than 100 million yuan of waste. This example shows that as long as we have a strong sense of responsibility for state property, the serious waste in large-scale projects can be avoided.

At present, the waste in this material yard has not been investigated, and the loopholes have not been plugged. The local municipal Party committee of the tractor factory is organizing personnel to thoroughly investigate so as to draw lessons that are beneficial to future work. This is a completely necessary measure. It is hoped that the leading cadres of the construction engineering unit undertaking the construction of the tractor factory, as well as the leading cadres of its subordinate materials, transportation and other relevant departments, will seriously and humbly treat this inspection, improve their work, and welcome the large-scale construction that is about to unfold.

    大规模工程中的浪费是不可避免的吗
    本报记者　张健虹
    承建我国第一个拖拉机制造厂的建筑工程单位在去年冬季施工中是有成绩的。他们在任务不断增加，时间十分短促的情况下，超额完成了一九五四年的修建职工永久宿舍的计划。但是，这个建筑工程单位，在这一段工作中，却忽视了节约，因而严重浪费了国家的建设资金。
    让我们看看这几笔账：生产管理处的木材加工厂因计划不周和优材劣用而浪费的木材，价值二十多亿元（旧币、下同）。材料供应处因盲目采购稻草席子，造成积压，损失二十亿零九百六十二万元。一零二工区冬季施工浪费五亿六千一百万元。这是算得出账来的项目。此外，还有一个至今尚未确切算出账来的无底漏洞——这就是属于材料供应处管理的一个材料场。
    只要你到这个材料场走一趟，就可以看到垒得高高的水泥、钢筋、以及那像长堤一样的白粉粉的石灰，都在露天存放着。这些建筑材料经过长时期的风吹雨淋，日晒夜露，多已面目全非了。成百吨的钢筋生了锈，五千多吨水泥中靠近地面的部分已开始凝化，石灰少了四百五十二吨，余下的全部变了质。原来出厂验收都是二八块灰，每六百公斤，可以化一立方公尺水灰，现在却需要一千二百多公斤，才能化一立方公尺。使用率降低了一半多。
    这个材料场的浪费是惊人的。管理上非常混乱，远道运来的原木，因卸车时不小心拉断插桩，翻滚倒泻，互相碰折而受损失的，每个车皮多至三十余根，少至七、八根。原木折断后只好大材小用，或成了废材。由各地买进的砖、石、灰、沙，层层叠叠卸在一起，终至分不清哪是石灰，哪是沙子。砖头由产地起运，直到入库，经过多番摔碰，报废和缺角的几达百分之五十。外地运来的钢筋，材料处还没过磅，就给工地来的卡车拉跑了。采购员从火车上把材料卸在铁路边就不管了，两个月以后材料供应处一个干部，经过这里才发现这堆材料是他们的。至于捆得好好的竹笆，卸车时扔散又捆，装水泥的纸袋碰破了又重新包装，车上卸货的数字很小，进货单上数字却很大等等奇怪的现象到处皆是。
    去年十一月，拖拉机厂所在地上级党委和当地市委，曾派员来这个材料场检查工作，他们估算这里每日的损失约值两千万到三千万元。接着承建拖拉机厂的建筑工程单位的党委会，也指示纪律检查科和调查研究科到这个材料场作过检查。据他们粗略地估算九月至十一月期间的几个损失数字为：发车到购货地点运货，因计划不周终未运上，因而放空车，受铁路机关罚款两亿一千一百十三万元；不了解货源，盲目高价进货，多支出四亿四千五百九十二万元；现场堆货混乱，又从新整理，加工费两亿七千九百九十五万元；木材损失三亿七千五百万元；青、红砖耗损值两亿四千多万元。至于带多钱买少货，滞压资金的事，也是很多的。有一次到东北买水泥，货品仅值一亿元，由于心中无数，就带了五亿元，影响到资金一时周转不灵。
    但是，党委历次检查中所揭发的这些严重的浪费和工作中的缺点，并没有引起建筑工程单位有关领导同志的警惕。当上级党委来这个材料场做反浪费的动员时，材料供应处副处长王新亭就表示：材料场有浪费，但是客观原因很多，主要的责任不该我们负。他口头上虽然向大家说：“浪费由我负责，”但实际上是借以封闭批评和自我批评的大门。从此，他就不乐意人们在会上提出关于浪费的事，提了就是“挑拨离间，有意找岔子，寻缺点。”因此，材料供应处有的党员反映：“以后再也不敢发言了。这里政治空气太稀薄，党的指示，没法切实贯彻下去。”最近，材料供应处内各科在清产核资中，发现原木比账上多出了三百六十一立方公尺，瓦片多出两万四千多块，石子多出二百一十多立方公尺。王新亭对这个显然是反映了材料工作的混乱的情况不作检查，反而沾沾自喜，认为材料场的浪费只是人们的“误会”。由于材料供应处领导上这种骄傲自满情绪，一方面就阻碍了他们诚恳地接受来自各方面的批评，并根据党委检查工作的精神，来检讨造成浪费的主观原因；另一面就过分地强调了客观困难，放松了自己对克服浪费、改进工作作应有的努力。因此，直到现在，这个材料场除了多盖了几个席棚，确定了货位外，就谈不上什么管理上的根本改善。刮风时，石灰像浓雾一般在方圆三四里以内飞旋，水泥继续在变质，钢筋仍然在发锈。
    这个材料场的浪费和混乱情况，材料供应处的上级领导机关——承建拖拉机厂的建筑单位是负有重要责任的。施工以来，他们就没有认真贯彻节约的精神。他们把反浪费当成一阵风，作了些口头的动员后，就没有严格督促这个材料场的干部们作出切实克服浪费的必要措施。去年十月，上级建筑工程局的负责同志，根据实际经验向他们作了关于工程方面节约的报告，指出在施工中，如果贯彻计划管理，推行先进的劳动定额，进行经济核算，多做几个方案，选择其中最经济的一个实行。这样，为国家节约两三千亿元，完全是可能的。如果与此相反，也可能很容易地便浪费掉了两三千亿元。可是，这个材料场的同志们没有很好地研究这些意见，反而对工作中的各种浪费有意无意地采取纵容态度。曾经有人向建筑工程单位的领导者之一顾准同志反映过这个材料场的浪费情况，但他竟说：
  “不忙批评，以免影响工作情绪。”他也承认材料场的浪费是惊人的，是一笔糊涂账，但却不主张从思想上作深入的检查。这个材料场一度将要掀起的反浪费声浪又平静下来。当干部们不断反映浪费严重时，顾准同志总是认为：“大规模工程，浪费不可避免，值不得大惊小怪。”“冬季施工追加任务次数多，增产节约来不及。”
    大规模工程的浪费能否避免，主要问题在于我们怎样认识完成建设任务和节约之间的关系，是把它们看成一个整体呢，还是把它们对立起来看待？显然，工程规模越大，国家投资越多，稍一浪费，造成的损失也越大，因此，大规模的建设工程，不是浪费可否避免的问题，而是必须避免浪费，不是增产节约来不及，而是必须贯彻增产节约的精神。最近工地计划买一千公斤刷墙的矾红，错写成贵重的油漆料西红，材料供应处采购科造表册的同志一看，觉得按现在的工程，绝不会需要这样多的西红，终于纠正了这个错误，避免了一亿多元的浪费。这个事例说明：只要我们对国家财产有强烈的责任感，大规模工程中的严重浪费是能够避免的。
    现在，这个材料场的浪费尚未查清，漏洞也未堵塞。拖拉机厂当地中共市委正组织人员前往彻查，以便得出对今后工作有益的教训。这是一个完全必要的措施。希望承建拖拉机厂的建筑工程单位的领导干部，以及其所属材料、运输等有关部门的领导干部，严肃地虚心地对待这次检查，改善自己的工作，迎接即将展开的大规模施工。
