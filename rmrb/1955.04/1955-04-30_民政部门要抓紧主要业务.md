Currently, civil affairs departments at all levels of government are, in accordance with the spirit of the Third National Civil Affairs Conference, focusing on key tasks such as preferential treatment, demobilization, disaster relief, and social relief, and are striving to rectify and strengthen these efforts. This is entirely in line with the actual situation and the demands of the people for civil affairs departments.

However, some staff members of civil affairs departments still fail to correctly recognize the significant importance of these tasks. Some comrades superficially acknowledge that preferential treatment, demobilization, disaster relief, and social relief are important tasks and believe that great efforts should be made to do these tasks well. However, they also say that their regions have neither suffered disasters, nor has the preferential treatment and social relief work been done well, it seems that there is nothing more to do in the future. This statement is divorced from reality and unconvincing. In recent years, various regions have indeed made many achievements in preferential treatment, demobilization, disaster relief, and social relief, but there are also many shortcomings in these tasks that urgently need to be improved. In many regions, the production of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers has not been organized effectively, and there are many pressing problems in production and life that have not been resolved. For example, in the Shaanxi-North region, the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers were originally thought to have mostly established households, but according to a recent inspection, only 25 percent of families in the Suide Special District have actually established households. Many revolutionary disabled soldiers and demobilized construction soldiers in some areas have not been properly resettled, and some have even suffered unreasonable discrimination and exclusion. The civil affairs departments in some areas pay very little attention to the use of large amounts of preferential treatment funds, so that some of these funds have been accumulated for a long time without being distributed in a timely manner, while others have been distributed haphazardly and evenly, failing to play the role they should have. Still others have been embezzled or misappropriated. Great efforts must be made to gradually solve these problems. Only those who close their eyes to the facts can say that there is no work to be done in this regard. The statement that there is no disaster situation is acceptable for a certain area at a certain time, but we must never conclude from this that that area does not need to prevent natural disasters at all. For a larger area, there will always be some areas that suffer from varying degrees of natural disasters such as floods, droughts, insects, winds, frost, and hail every year. As for households with difficult living conditions in society, there will always be some in both urban and rural areas, disaster areas and non-disaster areas. This is a problem left over from the old China, which cannot be completely solved in a short period of time. We must provide necessary relief to these poor people, and at the same time help them find ways to produce, so that they can gradually solve their living problems fundamentally and play a role in the country's construction undertakings. Therefore, in terms of preferential treatment, demobilization, disaster relief, and social relief, whether now or in the future for a relatively long period, it is not that there is nothing to do, but that there are many tasks that urgently need to be done well. If we do more practical investigations, instead of relying only on subjective assumptions or only listening to superficial reports, we will never come to the conclusion that there is no work to be done.

In addition, there are some comrades who admit that these tasks have not been completely done well, but always feel that preferential treatment, demobilization, disaster relief, and social relief are not important tasks, but trivial matters, equivalent to "doing chores", and believe that there is no future in doing these tasks. This is completely wrong. The only criterion for measuring the importance of all work is the interests of the country and the people. Anything that is beneficial to the country and the people is important and promising. Since preferential treatment, demobilization, disaster relief, and social relief are related to the interests of a large number of people and the country's construction undertakings, it must be affirmed that these are important and promising tasks. Only those who do not truly care about the interests of the country and the people and are unwilling to serve the people wholeheartedly will regard these tasks as "chores". This kind of thinking is not the thinking of true revolutionary workers, but the thinking of those bureaucratic persons who are divorced from the masses and do not care about the lives of the masses.

Carrying out preferential treatment work for the families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers, and carrying out resettlement work for demobilized construction soldiers, helping them to solve their living difficulties, establish households, and improve production, is an important work with great political and economic significance in our country. This group of people totals tens of millions, most of whom are working people who have made certain contributions to the people's revolutionary cause and the cause of defending the motherland, and have relatively high political awareness and patriotic enthusiasm, and can actively respond to the country's various calls. Doing a good job in preferential treatment is not only the responsibility that the country must assume in order to relieve their living difficulties, but also has a positive significance for consolidating the revolutionary troops, encouraging the revolutionary fighters' enthusiasm to defend the motherland, and encouraging the people to love their army and actively participate in the revolutionary struggle. Moreover, because a large part of them have certain labor ability and production technology, doing a good job in preferential treatment can bring their production enthusiasm and political enthusiasm into play, so that they can play a great role in various construction work and socialist transformation undertakings.

Disaster relief work is also an important work that the Party and the government have always attached great importance to. We have not yet been able to completely avoid the invasion of natural disasters, so every year there will always be some areas that suffer disasters and poor harvests. If we do not pay attention to disaster relief work and do it poorly, it will expand the disaster-stricken area, increase the disaster-stricken population, and make it impossible to relieve the living difficulties of the disaster-stricken people, thereby affecting the country's socialist construction undertakings, affecting the relationship between the people and the government, affecting the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, and even giving counter-revolutionaries a chance to disrupt social order. Therefore, disaster relief work is also a work with important political and economic significance.

Social relief work is also of great importance in our country. The old China left us with a large number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people. In recent years, we have made great efforts and various effective measures to implement labor employment and social relief, so that a large part of them have found jobs or received relief, and have gradually embarked on the battle line of productive labor. However, there are still a considerable number of people who, due to subjective and objective reasons, still need the government to continue to provide relief or support them in production. If this work is not done well, it will also make it impossible for the strength of many people to be brought into play, thereby affecting the country's construction undertakings and even affecting the stability of social order.

This shows that the Third National Civil Affairs Conference's determination that civil affairs departments should focus on preferential treatment, demobilization, disaster relief, and social relief as their main tasks is completely correct. In order to implement the spirit of the Third National Civil Affairs Conference, Hubei, Xikang, Yunnan, Gansu, Xinjiang, Shaanxi, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Qinghai, Hebei, Rehe, Guangxi, Guizhou and other provinces, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Tianjin have all convened civil affairs conferences to review the work of the past and make specific arrangements for the work of 1955. Through the review of the past work, it was revealed that there were many problems in the work of preferential treatment, demobilization, disaster relief, and social relief, and that there was a serious lack of understanding of the situation and serious bureaucratism in these tasks. At the same time, the specific facts educated the civil affairs cadres, enabling them to realize the importance of these tasks and that they should work hard to do them well. Places that have not yet convened civil affairs conferences should convene them quickly under the leadership of the local Party committees and governments.

At present, many disaster areas have sent a large number of staff to investigate the disaster situation, check the distribution and use of relief grain and funds, and help the disaster victims carry out spring plowing and production, which is very good. Many provinces and cities, in order to grasp the basic situation of the work in general areas, regard the classification and ranking of the production and living conditions of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and the investigation and registration of urban poor people as a basic construction task in civil affairs work and are seizing the opportunity to carry it out. The civil affairs departments of Guangdong, Gansu, Liaoning and other provinces have sent a large number of cadres and students from the schools for revolutionary disabled soldiers to conduct typical trials on this work. The minister and vice minister of the civil affairs department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the director and deputy director of the civil affairs department of Jilin Province have personally participated in the typical trials. Many cities are also classifying and ranking demobilized soldiers, according to their education level, age, whether they have technology, and what kind of work they can undertake, and are striving to resettle them in the shortest possible time. However, some places have not yet taken any action in this regard, which is not right. Civil affairs departments at all levels should, after typical trials, universally launch the classification and ranking of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and the investigation and registration of urban poor people and demobilized soldiers who should be resettled in factories, mines and other enterprises or departments, and according to the results of the classification and ranking and investigation and registration, determine specific methods for different objects, organize their production, relieve their production and living difficulties, and properly resettle them. On the basis of this work, a system of regularly grasping the situation should also be established, so as to replace the general leadership with in-depth and specific leadership, and to continuously improve the civil affairs work.

### 民政部门要抓紧主要业务

    民政部门要抓紧主要业务
    目前各级政府民政部门正在按照第三次全国民政会议的精神，以优抚、复员、救灾、社会救济为主要业务，努力整顿和加强这些工作。这是完全适合实际情况和人民群众对于民政部门的要求的。
    但是，现在有些民政部门的工作人员还不能正确地认识这些工作的重大意义。有的同志表面上承认优抚、复员、救灾和社会救济工作是重要的，认为应当大力作好这些工作，但同时又说自己工作的地区既没有遭灾，而优抚和社会救济工作又已经作好，似乎今后再没有什么工作可作。这种说法是脱离实际的，不能令人信服的。几年来，各地在优抚、复员、救灾和社会救济工作上确曾作出许多成绩，但是这些工作中也同时存在着不少缺点，亟应改进。有许多地区，烈属军属的生产始终没有组织好，生产上和生活上都有不少急待解决的问题没有得到解决。例如陕北地区的烈属军属，原被认为大部分已经建立起家务，然而根据最近检查，绥德专区实际上建立起家务的只占百分之二十五。不少地区的革命残废军人和复员建设军人也还有许多人没有得到妥善安置，有的甚至遭受着无理的歧视和排斥。有些地区的民政部门对于大量的优抚事业费的使用极不注意，以至这些钱有的被长期积压，没有及时发下，有的则被胡乱平均发放，没有发挥应有的作用。还有的被贪污或者挪用了。对于这些问题都必须付出很大的力量才能逐步解决。只有闭着眼睛不看事实的人，才能说这方面已经没有工作可做。没有灾情的说法，在某一个地区的某一个时候来说是可以的；但我们绝对不能因此得出结论，说那个地区根本不需要预防灾荒的发生了。而就一个较大的地区来说，则每年总会有一部分地区遭受不同程度的水、旱、虫、风、霜、雹等自然灾害的。至于社会上的生活困难户，更是无论城市和农村，无论灾区和非灾区都会有一些的，这是旧中国遗留给我们的、不可能在短时期内全部解决的一个问题。我们必须对这些贫困者进行必要的救济，同时帮助他们寻找生产的道路，使他们逐渐从根本上解决生活问题，同时在国家的建设事业中发挥作用。因此，在优抚、复员、救灾和社会救济方面，无论现在或将来一个较长时期，都不是没有什么工作可作，而是有许多工作迫切需要我们作好。如果我们多作些实际考察，不是只凭主观臆断，或者只听表面报告，那就决不能得出没有工作可做的结论。
    另外也还有一些同志承认这些工作确实还没有完全作好，但又总觉得优抚、复员、救灾和社会救济不是什么重要的工作，而是些繁琐的小事，等于“打杂”，认为作这些工作没有出息，没有前途。这更是完全错误的。我们衡量一切工作的重要或不重要，唯一的标准是国家和人民的利益。凡是对国家和人民有利的，都是重要的和有前途的事情。优抚、复员、救灾和社会救济既然关系到为数众多的人民的利益和国家的建设事业，那就必须肯定这些都是重要的和有出息的工作。只有那些并不真正关心国家和人民的利益，不愿意踏踏实实为人民群众服务的人，才会把这些工作看成“打杂”。这种思想不是真正革命工作者的思想，而是那些脱离群众、不关心群众生活的高高在上的官僚主义者的思想。
    对革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人进行优抚工作和对复员建设军人进行安置工作，帮助他们解除生活困难，建立家务，提高生产，在我们国家是具有很大政治意义和经济意义的重要工作。这一部分人总共有好几千万，其中绝大多数都是劳动人民，对人民革命事业和保卫祖国的事业都有一定的贡献，并且有比较高的政治觉悟和爱国热情，能够积极响应国家的各种号召。作好优抚工作，不仅是国家为了解除他们的生活困难所必须担负的责任，而且对于巩固革命部队、鼓舞革命战士保卫祖国的热情、鼓舞人民群众热爱自己的军队和积极参加革命斗争，都有积极的意义。而且因为他们中间的很大一部分人具有一定的劳动能力和生产技术，所以作好了优抚工作，就能够把他们的生产积极性和政治积极性发挥起来，使他们在各方面建设工作和社会主义改造事业中发挥很大的作用。
    救灾工作同样也是党和政府历来十分重视的重要工作。我们还没有可能完全避免自然灾害的侵袭，因而每年总会有若干地区遭灾和歉收。如果对救灾工作不加重视，作得不好，就会使受灾面积扩大，受灾人口增多，受灾人民的生活困难无法解除，以至影响到国家的社会主义建设事业，影响到人民同政府的关系，影响到工农联盟的巩固，甚至给反革命分子捣乱社会秩序以可乘之机。所以救灾工作同样是具有重要政治意义和经济意义的工作。
    社会救济工作在我们国家也有很大的重要性。旧中国遗留给我们以大量的失业者、半失业者。几年来我们曾经以极大的努力和各种有效的措施实行劳动就业和社会救济，使其中很大一部分人找到了职业或者得到了救济，逐渐走上生产劳动的战线。但是也还有相当一部分人由于主观和客观的原因，仍然需要政府继续进行救济或者在生产上予以支持。这方面的工作如果作得不好，同样会使许多人的力量不能发挥，从而影响到国家的建设事业，甚至影响到社会秩序的安定。
    这就说明，第三次全国民政会议确定民政部门以优抚、复员、救灾和社会救济为主要业务，这是完全正确的。为了贯彻第三次全国民政会议的精神，湖北、西康、云南、甘肃、新疆、陕西、吉林、黑龙江、青海、河北、热河、广西、贵州等省，内蒙古自治区和天津市都召开了民政会议，对过去的工作进行了检查，对一九五五年的工作作了具体的部署。通过对过去工作的检查，暴露了优抚、复员、救灾和社会救济工作中存在许多问题，暴露了在这些工作上不了解下情，存在着严重的官僚主义；同时也用具体事实教育了民政干部，使他们认识到这些工作的重要性，应该努力作好。凡没有召开民政会议的地方，应该在当地党委和政府的领导下迅速召开。
    目前许多灾区已经派出大批工作人员去调查灾情，检查救济粮款的发放、使用情况，帮助灾民进行春耕生产，这是很好的。许多省、市为了掌握一般地区工作的基本情况，把对烈属、军属生产和生活情况的分类排队，对城市贫民进行调查登记等工作，当作民政工作中的一项基本建设任务，抓紧进行。广东、甘肃、辽宁等省民政厅已派出大批干部和革命残废军人学校学员对这一工作进行典型试办，内蒙古自治区民政部的部长、副部长，吉林省民政厅的厅长、副厅长都亲自参加了典型试办。许多城市对于复员军人也正在分类排队，按照他们的文化程度、年龄大小、有无技术、可担任何种工作，争取于最短期间安置他们。但是有的地方在这方面还没有动静，这是不对的。各级民政部门都应该经过典型试办以后普遍展开对烈属、军属的分类排队和对城市贫民以及应该在厂矿企业或其他部门安置的复员军人的调查登记工作，并根据分类排队和调查登记的结果，分别不同对象，确定具体办法，组织他们生产，解除他们生产和生活上的困难，妥善地安置他们。在这一工作的基础上，还应该建立起经常掌握情况的制度，以便用深入的具体的领导来代替一般化的领导，使民政工作不断的进步。
