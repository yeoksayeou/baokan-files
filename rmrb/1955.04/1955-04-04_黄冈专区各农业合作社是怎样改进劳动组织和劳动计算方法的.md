Let Agricultural Production Cooperatives Engage in Production in an Orderly Manner
Editor's Note: The spring plowing and sowing season has arrived, and agricultural production cooperatives in various regions are about to begin intensive collective labor. How to allocate labor properly so that production can proceed in an orderly manner is an important issue that all agricultural production cooperatives—especially the 400,000 new cooperatives established last winter and this spring—must resolve. Judging from the establishment of cooperatives in recent years, almost all agricultural production cooperatives experienced improper labor allocation or chaotic "all hands on deck" phenomena when they first engaged in collective labor. As a result, the superiority of collective management could not be fully realized, production suffered many losses, and the cooperative members were also dissatisfied. Experience has proven that after mutual aid teams develop into agricultural production cooperatives, decentralized management becomes collective management, and the mode of production changes. The methods of managing production and organizing labor must change accordingly, and a responsibility system in production must be implemented. In order to help agricultural production cooperatives solve the problem of labor organization, quickly establish a normal production order, and do a good job in spring plowing and sowing, we plan to publish articles and newsletters successively to introduce the experience of agricultural production cooperatives in implementing the responsibility system.

How the Agricultural Cooperatives in Huanggang Prefecture Improved Labor Organization and Labor Calculation Methods
Huang Daquan

In the spring of 1954, Huanggang Prefecture, Hubei Province, established 270 new agricultural production cooperatives, which, together with the original three old cooperatives, totaled 273 cooperatives. Through a year of work, most of these cooperatives have gradually improved in terms of labor organization and labor calculation. According to statistics, except for a few small cooperatives that have not implemented the contract system, 80 cooperatives in the region have implemented short-term piece-rate contracts, 150 cooperatives have implemented seasonal contracts, and three cooperatives have implemented contract production.

When the cooperatives were first established, the cooperative cadres had no experience and still led the agricultural cooperatives using the methods of leading mutual aid teams. Work was arranged on a daily, temporary, and unified basis. This made the cooperative director extremely busy every day, and the cooperative members worked blindly and chaotically. Labor calculation was done using the "fixed division and live evaluation" method, with all cooperative members evaluating work points and recording scores together every night. This was not only difficult to evaluate fairly and reasonably but also made the cooperative members exhausted. As a result, a serious "idling" phenomenon occurred, work could not keep up with production needs, and the cooperative members' enthusiasm for labor gradually declined. This situation shows that the methods of organizing production in mutual aid teams are no longer applicable to the new organizational form of agricultural cooperatives.

Then, what method should be adopted to adapt to the new economic organizational form of agricultural cooperatives and to organize the labor of agricultural cooperatives reasonably in order to overcome the "idling" and chaos? From the perspective of Huanggang area, implementing "labor grouping" is the first step in solving this problem.

"Labor grouping" has two situations: one is to temporarily divide the labor into several groups and temporarily divide the land into several cultivation areas according to production needs. The other is to divide the labor into several fixed production teams (or groups) according to the cooperative members' residences, the distribution of core members within the cooperative, etc., and then assign fixed cultivation areas to each group according to the labor situation of each group (generally calculated based on "base scores"). The former situation is mostly adopted by small cooperatives with a dozen or so households; the latter situation is mostly adopted by large cooperatives with more than 20 households. And the latter is the development of the former.

After implementing labor grouping and land zoning, the responsibility of the production team leaders was strengthened. The phenomenon of the cooperative director being busy and the cooperative members working chaotically was overcome, and the situation of "idling" was also reduced. However, during group work, there were often disagreements between groups, mainly because the labor calculation was unfair. Because at this time, each group did not understand the production situation, and there was no unified standard for evaluating work points and recording scores. It was inevitable that some groups would score too high and some would score too low if each group carried out "fixed division and live evaluation" on its own. As a result, the "fixed division and live evaluation" method became a mere formality, and scores were basically recorded according to each person's "base score" every day. This unfair labor calculation seriously affected the cooperative members' enthusiasm for labor. Moreover, because doing light work and doing heavy work received the same score, the cooperative members all competed to do light work and were unwilling to do heavy work, willing to do dry work, and unwilling to do wet work. The groups observed each other, with Group A fearing that Group B would start work late and Group B fearing that Group A would finish work early. In order to supervise the actions of other groups, some groups even sent people to the mountains to keep watch. When they saw other groups finishing work, they would also finish work accordingly.

From the above situation, after the implementation of "labor grouping" in agricultural cooperatives, how to improve labor calculation accordingly is a major issue.

In order to solve the problem of unfair labor calculation between groups, some cooperatives have adopted some "stopgap" measures. For example, restricting the scoring of each group, not allowing it to exceed ten or twelve points at most; merging the divided production groups, etc. It is obvious that these methods cannot solve the problem. What method should be used to solve this problem? The successful experience of many cooperatives proves that it is necessary to implement the contract system on the basis of "labor grouping." Only by adopting this management method can we adapt to the new production relations after the transformation of mutual aid teams into cooperatives.

The implementation of the contract system started with "short-term piece-rate contracts." This is the primary form of the contract system. Its characteristic is that the cooperative sets quality standards for a certain piece of farm work and contracts it to each production team with fixed work points. After the piece of farm work is completed, if the team uses fewer work points than the cooperative contracted, the extra work points still belong to the team; if the team uses more work points than the cooperative contracted, the cooperative will no longer give work points for the extra work points used.

The implementation of "short-term piece-rate contracts" initially implemented the principle of "more work, more pay." The production teams of many cooperatives have initially implemented "payment according to labor" for cooperative members according to the cooperative's production quotas. The specific methods are: implement individual contracts for work that can be contracted to individuals, "payment by the piece"; implement "payment by the piece" or "fixed division and live evaluation" within the "collective" for work that must be "collectively contracted"; implement "fixed division and live evaluation" within the team for work that cannot be "contracted." In this way, the problem of unfair labor calculation between groups was initially resolved.

The implementation of "short-term piece-rate contracts" improved the method of calculating labor days, and the cooperative members' enthusiasm for labor was greatly improved. Women also actively came out to participate in production. The labor efficiency of agricultural cooperatives therefore increased. In this way, on the one hand, the time for doing work was shortened, seizing the opportunity in terms of time; on the other hand, more labor was left over to carry out diversified operations and increase income.

The advantage of "short-term piece-rate contracts" is that it is relatively simple to do, easy to contract accurately, and easy for cooperative members to accept, suitable for adoption when the cooperative is first established. The disadvantage is that the contract time is short, contracting every two or three days, and the cooperative cadres will delay a lot of work. This problem can generally be solved after the cooperative has gained experience in "short-term piece-rate contracts" by implementing "seasonal contracts."

"Seasonal contracts" are the development of "short-term piece-rate contracts." Most cooperatives in Huanggang area have adopted this form after gaining experience in "short-term piece-rate contracts." In specific implementation, there are two situations: one is to set the time shorter, such as harvesting wheat and transplanting rice for one season, weeding and hoeing for one season, and autumn planting and autumn harvesting for one season; the other is to set the time longer, contracting from harvesting wheat and transplanting rice until harvesting rice.

The implementation of "seasonal contracts" solved the problem of cooperative cadres delaying too much work, but the responsibility of each production team leader (or captain) for managing production was increased. Therefore, how to help the team leader solve the problem of team leadership is a very important issue after the implementation of "seasonal contracts."

According to the experience of various cooperatives, it is necessary to help the team leader solve three problems: ① Make short-term arrangements well. The team leader must have a plan for each stage of life and be clear about it. Rao Xingli Agricultural Cooperative in Xishui County put forward the method of "grasping the three heads" to concretize the work of making short-term arrangements. The so-called "grasping the three heads" means grasping production, grasping time, and grasping cooperative members' self-reported labor days. By grasping these three heads, the cooperative has a plan, the team (group) has a plan, and the cooperative members also have a plan. In this way, the cooperative's production and the cooperative members' labor are closely combined. ② Arrange work according to the needs of production and the strengths of cooperative members. In this way, on the one hand, "idling" can be avoided, and on the other hand, the creativity of cooperative members can be brought into play, and labor efficiency can be improved. ③ Further improve labor calculation. In the process of strictly implementing the principles of "payment by the piece," "fixed division and live evaluation," and "payment according to labor" combining the two, attention should be paid to taking care of heavy, wet, and hard work in the several types of work contracted to cooperative members. The method is to classify the work, such as mudding is heavy work, which should be first-class work, recording ten points for a labor day; hoeing wheat is light work, which is second-class work, recording nine points for a labor day, etc.

Failure to guarantee the quality of work, or uneven quality, is the main contradiction between teams after the implementation of "seasonal contracts." In solving this problem, in addition to educating the cooperative members, the cooperatives also formulated a field management responsibility system and an inspection and evaluation system. These methods have played a certain role in ensuring quality. However, the actual situation of various cooperatives also shows that the quality problem of work has not been completely solved in "seasonal contracts." The fundamental solution to this problem is to implement "contract production."

"Contract production" is the advanced form of the contract farming system. The results of the trial implementation by three cooperatives in Huanggang area prove that it can strengthen the cooperative members' sense of responsibility for production, solve the problem of work quality, and eliminate the estrangement between teams. Before the contract production, Rao Xingli Cooperative in Xishui County proposed 160 dan of coarse fertilizer per mu of land. The fifth production team said that this requirement was too high; however, after the contract production, the cooperative members of the fifth team not only stopped saying that it was too high but also increased 20 dan of fertilizer per mu of land under the cooperative's requirements. The beans on the edges of the fields were ignored in the previous year; last year, after the contract production, they were replanted three times due to rain damage.

Their method of "contract production" is to contract by season, that is, autumn harvest crops for one season and late autumn crops for one season. Autumn harvest crops are divided into rice, cotton, and miscellaneous grains, and late autumn crops are divided into second-season rice, regenerated rice, buckwheat, and mud beans. The land for each crop is first divided into several types according to soil quality, water conservancy, sunlight, and other conditions, and then the teams are arranged; then, the production is set according to the potential that each type of field and land can exert under the existing technical conditions of the cooperative. Individual fields and land with greater or smaller potential are extracted for individual evaluation. Then, technical measures are formulated according to the output, that is, the quality requirements are set. Finally, the required work points are determined according to the quality and the amount of labor used.

In "contract production," the most important issue is how to contract accurately: it is necessary to give full play to the potential that each piece of land can exert under the current circumstances, and to prevent the deviation of blindly setting the output too high. Therefore, the work of setting production should pay special attention to following the mass line and pay attention to fighting against the departmentalism of various teams (groups). Only in this way can the contracting be accurate.

In addition, for the production teams that exceed the production target, it is necessary to stipulate the method of overproduction reward, only in this way can the agricultural cooperative guarantee to obtain increased production.

    让农业生产合作社有秩序地投入生产
    编者按：春耕播种季节已经来到，各地农业生产合作社就要开始进行紧张的集体劳动了。在春耕生产中，怎样把劳力调配好，使生产能够有秩序地进行，这是所有农业生产合作社——特别是去冬今春新建立起来的四十万个合作社必须解决的一个重要问题。从几年来建立合作社的情况来看，几乎所有的农业生产合作社在初次进行集体劳动的时候，都曾发生劳力调配不当或干活“一窝蜂”的混乱现象；结果集体经营的优越性不能充分发挥，生产遭受很多损失，社员群众也不满意。经验证明，互助组发展成为农业生产合作社以后，分散经营变成了集体经营，生产方式变了，管理生产、组织劳动的办法必须随之改变，必须实行生产上的责任制度。为了帮助农业生产合作社解决劳动组织的问题，使正常的生产秩序能够很快地建立起来，做好春耕播种工作，我们准备陆续发表一些文章和通讯，介绍农业生产合作社实行责任制的经验。
    黄冈专区各农业合作社是怎样改进劳动组织和劳动计算方法的
    黄大全
    湖北省黄冈专区在一九五四年春，新建了二七○个农业生产合作社，连原有的三个老社，一共是二七三个社。这些社经过一年来的工作，大部分在劳动组织和劳动计算方面，逐步有了改进。据统计，全区除少数小社未实行包工制外，实行短期按活包工的有八○个社，实行季节包工的有一五○个社，实行包工包产的有三个社。一
    当社初成立的时候，社干部没有经验，仍然是以领导互助组的方法来领导农业社。做活是采取天天临时统一排工的办法。这就使社长每天忙得不可开交，社员干活盲目混乱。计算劳动是采取“死分活评”的办法，全体社员夜夜在一起评工记分。这样不仅难于评得公平合理，而且使社员疲劳不堪。结果产生了严重的“窝工”现象，干活赶不上生产需要，社员劳动情绪逐渐低落。这种情况，说明互助组组织生产的方法，已经不适用于农业社这个新的组织形式了。
    那末，采用什么方法，才能适应农业社这个新的经济组织形式，才能把农业社的劳动组织得合理，以便克服“窝工”和混乱现象呢？从黄冈地区来看，实行“劳力分组”，是解决这个问题的第一步。
    “劳力分组”，有两种情况：一种是根据生产需要，把劳力临时分成几个小组、把田地临时划分几个耕作区。另一种是根据社员的居住、社内骨干分子的分布等情况，把劳力编成几个固定的生产组
  （或队），再根据各组的劳力情况（一般是按“底分”计算），划给固定的耕作区。前种情况，是上十户的小社采用得多；后种情况，是二十户以上的大社采用得多。而后者又是前者的发展。
    实行劳力分组、土地划片以后，加强了生产组长的责任。社长忙乱，社员干活混乱的现象克服了，“窝工”的情况也少了。可是，在分组干活中，组和组之间常闹意见，主要原因是劳动计算不公。因为这时各组互不了解生产情况，而评工记分又没有统一的标准，各组自己进行“死分活评”，就难免发生偏高、偏低的现象。结果“死分活评”的办法流于形式，每天基本上是按各人的“底分”记分。这样劳动计算不公，就严重地影响了社员的劳动积极性。而且因为做轻活和做重活记分一样，所以社员都争着做轻活，不愿做重活，愿做干活，不愿做湿活。组和组之间则互相观望，甲组怕乙组上工迟，乙组怕甲组收工早。为了监督别组的行动，有的组还特意派人到山上去放哨，看到别组收了工，他们也就随着收工。
    从以上情况看来，在农业社实行了“劳力分组”之后，如何随着改进劳动计算，是一个主要问题。二
    为了解决组和组之间劳动计算不公的问题，有些社曾经采用过一些“头痛医头”的办法。如限制各组的评分，最多不许超过十分或十二分；把分了的生产组又合拢来等等。这些办法不能解决问题是显而易见的。应该用什么办法来解决这个问题呢？很多社的成功经验证明：必须在“劳力分组”的基础上，实行包工制。只有采用这种经营方法，才能适应互助组转社后的新的生产关系。
    实行包工制，是从“短期按活包工”开始。这是包工制的初级形式。它的特点，是由社里把某一件农活，定出质量标准，以固定的工分包给各生产组耕作。这件农活做完了，如用的工少于社里所包的工，多出来的工分仍然归给这个组；如用的工多于社里所包的工，多用的工社里不再给工分。
    实行了“短期按活包工”，初步贯彻了“多劳多得”的原则。许多社的生产组，都根据社的生产定额、对社员初步实行了“按劳计酬”，具体办法是：能够包给个人的活就实行个人包工，“按件计工”；必须“集体包工的活”，就在“集体”中实行“按件计工”或“死分活评”；不能“包工”的生活，就由小组内实行“死分活评”。这样一来，组与组之间存在的劳动计算不公的问题，就初步得到了解决。
    实行“短期按活包工”，改进了计算劳动日的方法，社员的劳动积极性就大大地提高了，妇女也都积极出来参加生产。农业社的劳动效率因此提高了。这样，一方面缩短了做活时间，从时间上抢住了火色；另方面又余出更多的劳动力，来进行多种经营，增加收入。
    “短期按活包工”的优点，是做起来比较简单，容易包得准，社员好接受，适宜于初建社时采用。缺点是包工时间短，三天两天一包，社干部要耽误很多工。这个问题，一般要在社里取得了“短期按活包工”的经验之后，实行“季节包工”才能解决。三
      “季节包工”，是“短期按活包工”的发展。黄冈地区多数社在取得了“短期按活包工”的经验之后，一般都采用了这种形式。在具体贯彻中，有两种情况：一种是把时间定得短些，如割麦插秧作一季、薅田锄草作一季，秋种秋收作一季；一种是把时间定得长些，从割麦插秧起、一直包到割谷。
    “季节包工”的实行，解决了社干部误工多的问题，但各个生产组长（或队长）管理生产的责任就加重了。因此，如何帮助组长解决组的领导问题，是实行“季节包工”后一个很重要的问题。
    根据各社的经验，要帮助组长解决好三个问题：①作好短安排。组长对一段一段的生活，要有计划，心中有数。浠水县饶兴礼农业社提出了“抓三头”的方法，把作好短安排具体化了。所谓“抓三头”，就是抓生（产）活，抓时间，抓社员自报劳动日。抓住了这三头，就做到了社里有计划，组（队）里有计划，社员也有计划。这样，就把社的生产和社员的劳动紧密结合起来了。②根据生产需要，按社员特长排工。这样，一方面可以避免“窝工”，一方面又能发挥社员的创造性，提高劳动效率。③进一步作好劳动计算。在严格地执行“按件计工”、“死分活评”、和两者相结合的“按劳计酬”原则的过程中，要注意包给社员的几种生活中，对重活、湿活、苦活，予以照顾。办法是把生活分等，如打泥是重活，应为一等工，一个劳动日记十分；锄麦是轻活，为二等工，一个劳动日九分等等。
    不能保证做活质量，或是质量不平衡，是实行“季节包工”后，组和组之间的主要矛盾。各社在解决这个问题时，除了对社员进行教育之外，还制定了田间管理责任制和检查评比的制度。这些办法，对保证质量都起了一定的作用。但是，各社的实际情况也表明：在“季节包耕”中，做活的质量问题，并没有完全解决。根本解决这个问题，是实行“包工包产”。四
    “包工包产”，是包耕制的高级形式。黄冈地区三个社试行的结果证明，它能够加强社员对生产的责任心，解决做活的质量问题；并能消除组和组之间的隔阂。浠水县饶兴礼社，在包产前提出每亩田上一百六十担粗肥，第五生产队说这个要求高了；可是包产后，五队的社员不但不再说高了，而且还在社的要求下，每亩田增加了二十担肥。田岸上的豆儿，前一年无人过问；去年包了产，因受雨害，就曾补种了三次。
    他们“包工包产”的办法是分季包，即秋收作物作一季、晚秋作物作一季。秋收作物分稻谷、棉花、杂粮，晚秋作物分二季稻、再生稻、荞麦、泥豆。每种作物的田地，都是首先按照土质、水利、阳光等条件，划分成若干类型，进行站队；再根据各类田、地在本社现有技术条件下所能发挥的潜力，进行定产。个别潜力较大或较小的田、地，就抽出来个别评定。然后根据产量订出技术措施，即把质量要求定出来。最后根据质量和用工数量订出所需的工分。
    在“包工包产”中，最主要的问题是如何包得准确：既要发挥每丘田地在目前情况下所能发挥的潜力，又要防止发生盲目把产量订得过高的偏差。因此，定产的工作更要特别注意走群众路线，并且要注意和各组（队）的本位主义思想作斗争。只有这样，才能包得准。
    此外，对超过定产指标的生产组，要规定超产奖励的办法，只有这样，才能保证农业社获得增产。
