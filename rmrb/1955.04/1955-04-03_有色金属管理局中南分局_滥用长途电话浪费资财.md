    South-Central Bureau of the Nonferrous Metals Administration
    Wastes Public Funds by Abusing Long-Distance Telephone Calls
    Not long ago, the Supervisory Office of the South-Central Bureau of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, together with relevant financial departments, inspected the financial work of the entire bureau and found serious waste in the use of administrative expenses. The most prominent issue was long-distance telephone charges.
    The South-Central Bureau of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration's expenditure on long-distance telephone charges is quite alarming, and this expenditure has been increasing month by month. For example, in the second half of 1954, excluding some regular calls related to production and capital construction work, the expenditure on long-distance telephone charges was as follows: more than 2,690 yuan in July, more than 2,850 yuan in August, more than 3,430 yuan in September, and it increased to more than 4,450 yuan in October. They used long-distance telephones even for things that did not require them, resulting in a lot of waste. For example, in order to handle the issue of Duan Hualin requesting a transfer because his wife was ill, the Personnel Department made two long-distance calls to the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration of the Ministry of Heavy Industry in Beijing, one for 21 minutes and one for 24 minutes, costing more than 100 yuan in telephone charges, which was more than the cost of sending someone to Beijing to inquire. However, this matter was not very urgent. The Personnel Department often made long-distance calls for the transfer of cadres, and they did not prepare the content of the conversation in advance, which wasted time and did not solve the problem. They even made three long-distance calls a day for one matter. Last year, they spent more than 800 yuan on telephone charges just to transfer a cadre to study abroad. They also used long-distance calls to contact and resolve many unimportant matters, such as understanding the installation of X-ray machines in the Xihuashan Workers' Hospital, and understanding the construction of school buildings. Why do they use long-distance telephones to solve everything? It is said to be for convenience, but they did not consider saving money for the country.
    The leadership of the South-Central Bureau has not paid attention to this phenomenon of lax financial system and waste of state funds for a long time. When there is a lot of waste, excessive spending, and a deficit in funds, instead of actively trying to prevent waste, practice thrift, and reduce administrative expenses, they go to add to the budget. Last year, they added more than 226,080 yuan to the telecommunications budget.
    The above phenomenon exists in many government organizations. I hope that all government organizations will pay attention to overcoming the waste phenomenon in the use of administrative expenses.

    有色金属管理局中南分局
    滥用长途电话浪费资财编辑同志：
    不久以前，重工业部有色金属工业管理局中南分局监察室会同有关财务部门检查了全局的财务工作，发现在行政管理费的使用方面存在着严重的浪费现象。最突出的是长途电话费。
    有色金属工业管理局中南分局在长途电话费上的开支是十分惊人的，而且这种开支逐月上升。例如，一九五四年下半年除去生产和基本建设工作上一些经常性的电话外，长途电话费的开支情况是：七月份二千六百九十多元，八月份二千八百五十多元，九月份三千四百三十多元，十月份就增加到了四千四百五十多元。有些事情不必要用长途电话的，他们也用长途电话，就造成了许多浪费。例如，人事处为了处理段华林因为爱人患病要求调动工作的问题，曾打了两次长途电话向北京重工业部有色金属工业管理局请示，一次是二十一分钟，一次是二十四分钟，电话费一百多元，比派一个人到北京请示所需的费用还大，然而这件事情并不是十分紧急的。人事处经常为了调动干部打长途电话，而且事先不准备好谈话的内容，到时既浪费时间又解决不了问题。甚至为了一件事情一天打三次长途电话。去年他们为了调一个干部出国实习，就用去了八百多元的电话费。许多并不重要的事情他们也用长途电话来联系解决，如了解西华山职工医院安装爱克斯光机的情形，了解学校房屋的修建情形等都打长途电话。为什么他们什么事情都用长途电话来解决呢？据说是为了方便，但是他们却没有考虑为国家节约的问题。
    对于这种财务制度不严，浪费国家资财的现象，中南分局的领导上长期没有注意。他们在浪费大，超支多，经费有亏空的时候，不是积极设法防止浪费，厉行节约，减少行政经费的开支，相反地却去追加预算。去年他们就追加电讯费预算二十二万六千零八十多元。
    上述这种现象在许多机关都是存在的。我希望各机关都来注意克服行政费用使用上的浪费现象。
