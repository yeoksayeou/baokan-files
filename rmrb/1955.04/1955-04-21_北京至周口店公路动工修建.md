    Construction Begins on Beijing-Zhoukoudian Highway
    Construction of the highway from near Lugou Bridge in Beijing to Zhoukoudian began on the 18th. This road will be built with an asphalt surface and will be approximately eighty li long.
    Zhoukoudian is where the ancestors of humans lived 500,000 years ago, and it is world-renowned for the discovery of "Peking Man" fossils in 1927. Many people visit every year, and the original dirt road can no longer meet the needs. After the completion of the Beijing-Zhoukoudian Highway, it will not only facilitate the scientific research of scientists and the sightseeing of tourists, but also facilitate the transportation in the suburbs of Beijing.

    北京至周口店公路动工修建
    从北京芦沟桥附近到周口店的公路十八日动工修建。这条路将修成为柏油路面，长约八十华里。
    周口店是五十万年前人类祖先曾经生活过的地方，由于一九二七年发现了“中国猿人”化石而闻名世界。每年前往参观的人很多，原有土路已不能适应需要。京周公路建成后，不但便于科学家的研究工作和旅客游览，而且有利于北京郊区的运输。
