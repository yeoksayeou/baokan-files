    Communiqué of the Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China
    1954 Recruitment and Replenishment Work Completed

    The work of the People's Republic of China in recruiting and replenishing soldiers in 1954 has been successfully completed under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party organizations at all levels and the local governments at all levels and with the enthusiastic support of the people throughout the country, since the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council promulgated the conscription order on September 11, 1954. Except for the four counties of Dinghai, Xiangshan, Hangxian, and Shengxian in Zhejiang Province, which ended on April 14, the rest of the regions ended before the end of March.

    During the recruitment and replenishment process, the people in various parts of the country showed a high degree of patriotism. Young people of all ethnic groups eagerly signed up for enlistment. They all wholeheartedly yearned to be glorious soldiers of the National Defense Army, fulfilling the sacred duty of defending the motherland. During the enlistment, many exemplary cases of parents sending their sons, wives sending their husbands, and brothers vying to enlist emerged in various places.

    This patriotic action of the people in various places fully illustrates the improvement of the patriotic thought of combining personal interests with national interests among the people of all ethnic groups, especially the vast number of young people. It illustrates their fervent desire and firm will to defend the motherland and defend their peaceful and happy life.

    The fact that this recruitment and replenishment work has received the active response and support of the people throughout the country also shows that it is timely and correct to implement the compulsory military service system in our country. In the process of recruiting and replenishing soldiers, various localities combined the publicity and discussion of the "Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China (Revised Draft)," and conducted widespread and in-depth publicity of the compulsory military service system to the broad masses of the people, and correctly implemented the conscription policy. People of all ethnic groups across the country expressed their warm support for the state's implementation of the compulsory military service system. They believe that the compulsory military service system is fair and reasonable, which not only conforms to the overall interests of the country, but also takes care of the specific interests of the people. This recruitment and replenishment work has laid a good foundation and a victorious start for our country's gradual transition from the voluntary military service system to the compulsory military service system. At present, the young people who have been approved to enlist in the army in various places have successively taken up the glorious post of defending the motherland.

    中华人民共和国国防部发表公报
    一九五四年度征集补充兵员工作结束
    新华社十七日讯  中华人民共和国国防部公报
    中华人民共和国一九五四年度征集补充兵员的工作，从一九五四年九月十一日前中央人民政府政务院公布征兵命令以来，在中国共产党各级组织和地方各级政府的正确领导以及全国人民的热烈支持下，已圆满地完成。其中除浙江省定海、象山、杭县、嵊县等四县在四月十四日结束外，其余各地都在三月底以前结束。
    全国各地人民在征集补充兵员过程中，表现了高度的爱国热忱。各族适龄青年都争先恐后地踊跃报名应征。他们都一心向往着做一个光荣的国防军战士，履行保卫祖国的神圣义务。在应征中，各地出现了许许多多的父母送儿子、妻子送丈夫、兄弟争相应征的模范事例。
    各地人民这种爱国行动，充分说明了全国各族人民特别是广大青年们把个人利益和国家利益结合起来的爱国主义思想的提高，说明了他们保卫祖国、保卫和平幸福生活的热烈愿望和坚强意志。
    这次征集补充兵员工作得到全国人民积极响应和支持的事实，还说明了在我国推行义务兵役制是适时的、正确的。在征集补充兵员过程中，各地都结合中华人民共和国兵役法（修正草案）的宣传和讨论，普遍、深入地对广大人民群众进行了义务兵役制的宣传，正确地贯彻执行了征兵政策。全国各族人民都表示热烈拥护国家实行义务兵役制。他们认为：义务兵役制是公平合理的，它既符合国家的整体利益，同时也照顾了人民的具体利益。这次征集补充兵员的工作已为我国由志愿兵制逐步过渡到义务兵役制奠定了良好的基础和胜利的开端。目前，各地被批准应征入伍的青年，已经陆续走上保卫祖国的光荣岗位。
