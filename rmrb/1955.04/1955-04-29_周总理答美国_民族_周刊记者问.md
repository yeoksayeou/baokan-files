Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 28th - Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China met with Mr. Jaffe, a reporter from the American "Nation" weekly, on the evening of the 25th and answered his questions. The questions and answers are as follows:

    Question: Why did the Premier insert a statement about the Chinese government's determination to liberate Taiwan in his closing speech at the Asian-African Conference?

    Answer: Liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair. The Chinese people have the right to make this demand and implement it. As for the tense situation in the Taiwan area, it is caused by American interference. This is an international issue. In order to ease the tense situation in the Taiwan area, China proposes that China and the United States should sit down and talk to resolve this issue.

    Question: Is the government of the People's Republic of China willing to sit down with the United States government and the Kuomintang to discuss the Taiwan issue?

    Answer: These are two completely different matters. The relationship between China and the United States is an international issue. The relationship between the People's Republic of China and the Chiang Kai-shek clique is a matter of internal affairs. These two matters cannot be confused.

    Question: Does the Premier believe that the current situation in the Taiwan area is dangerous enough to cause a third world war?

    Answer: There is indeed a crisis of a new international war in the current situation in Taiwan. But whether the current situation will lead to a major war depends on the United States, because there is no war between China and the United States now. The wishes of the Chinese people have already been stated in the declaration of April 23.

    Note: On April 23, the heads of delegations from Burma, Ceylon, China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand, who were attending the Asian-African Conference, held a meeting to discuss the issue of easing the tense situation in the Far East, especially the tense situation in the Taiwan area. Premier Zhou Enlai made following statement at the meeting: "The Chinese people are friendly to the American people.
    The Chinese People do not want to fight the United States. The Chinese government is willing to sit down and negotiate with the U.S. government to discuss the question of easing tensions in the Far East, and in particular the question of easing tensions in the Taiwan area."

    周总理答美国“民族”周刊记者问
    新华社雅加达二十八日电　中华人民共和国周恩来总理二十五日晚上接见了美国“民族”周刊记者贾菲，回答了他提出的问题。问题和答复如下：
    问：总理为什么在亚非会议闭幕演说中插进关于中国政府解放台湾的决心的声明？
    答：解放台湾是中国的内政。中国人民有权提出这个要求，并实行这个要求。至于台湾地区的紧张局势，那是美国的干涉造成的。这是国际问题。为了和缓台湾地区的紧张局势，中国提议，中国和美国应该坐下来谈，解决这个问题。
    问：中华人民共和国政府愿意坐下来同美国政府和国民党讨论台湾问题吗？
    答：这是两件完全不同的事。中国同美国的关系是国际问题。中华人民共和国同蒋介石集团的关系是内政问题。这两件事不能混为一谈。
    问：总理认为现在台湾地区的局势是否危险到足以引起第三次世界大战？
    答：在现在的台湾局势中的确存在着新的国际战争的危机。但是现在的形势是否会导致大战，决定于美国，因为中国和美国之间现在并不存在着战争。中国人民的意愿，已经在四月二十三日的声明中说过了。
      按：四月二十三日参加亚非会议的缅甸、锡兰、中国、印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦、菲律宾和泰国代表团团长曾举行会议，讨论了和缓远东紧张局势的问题，特别是和缓台湾地区紧张局势的问题。周恩来总理在会上发表了以下的声明：“中国人民同美国人民是友好的。
    中国人民不要同美国打仗。中国政府愿意同美国政府坐下来谈判，讨论和缓远东紧张局势的问题，特别是和缓台湾地区的紧张局势问题。”
