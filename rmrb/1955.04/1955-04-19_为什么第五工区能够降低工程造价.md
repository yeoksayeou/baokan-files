    Why the Fifth Construction Zone Could Reduce Construction Costs
    By our reporter Liu Heng
    The North China Directly Subordinate Second Construction Engineering Company had reduced its construction budget several times in 1954. Last year, when the construction engineering troops dispatched by the company to the Fifth Construction Zone (the location of the Fifth Construction Zone was Baotou) received the construction task and the task of reducing construction costs, they all started to discuss: "How can Baotou be compared with Beijing and Tianjin? Materials are expensive in Baotou, freight is expensive, the foundations are deep, and double-layered windows have to be installed..." The comrades of the construction unit heard that the construction troops were going to build such good houses for them at a very low cost, and they were skeptical. After the construction unit (Party A) and the contracting unit (Party B) signed the contract, Party A solemnly stated: "If there are any problems, speak up early, and don't argue with us later if there is not enough money!"
    A few months later, the houses were built. Not only was the quality guaranteed, but after calculating the accounts—ha, the actual cost was reduced by a total of 12.3 percent compared to the budgeted cost. The budgeted cost of a mixed-structure office building (per square meter, same below) was 91 yuan and 95 fen, and the actual cost was 79 yuan and 80 fen. The budgeted cost of a three-story mixed single dormitory was 83 yuan and 36 fen, and the actual cost was 73 yuan and 37 fen. The budgeted cost of a three-story mixed family dormitory with bathroom equipment was 102 yuan, and the actual cost was 92 yuan. The budgeted cost of a three-story mixed family dormitory without bathroom equipment was 86 yuan and 62 fen, and the actual cost was 82 yuan and 50 fen. The budgeted cost of a brick and wood structured bungalow was 61 yuan, and the actual cost was 49 yuan.
    The construction engineering troops working in the Fifth Construction Zone were very happy to hear this news! The North China Directly Subordinate Second Construction Engineering Company also praised them. The engineers and technicians who were originally holding their breath also breathed a sigh of relief and happily said: "Being with the construction engineering troops will not let us down!"
    Why was the Fifth Construction Zone able to reduce construction costs? Why were the construction engineering troops, who had never built houses before, able to build good and cheap houses?
    A responsible comrade from the Fifth Construction Zone gave me the answer to this question. The following is his speech:
      "This is not surprising at all if you deeply understand our soldiers.
    "Our soldiers are the most knowledgeable about cherishing state property, and they are some of the most caring people for state property. If they were not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice to protect the lives and property of the people during the war, would they waste the property of the state and the people during peaceful construction?
      "Suddenly, a storm broke out, blowing open the mats covering the cement piles, and many people would rush over to sew the mats on top of the cement piles. These people are our soldiers. A large opening suddenly appeared in the water storage pit, and the water was flowing out. Some people would immediately use their bodies to block the opening. These people are also our soldiers.
      "Our soldiers do not waste a single brick. Whole bricks are never broken for use, and broken bricks are never discarded. Whole bricks are used to build walls, and broken bricks are used to fill the core. Even the stinky bricks in the outhouses in the fields are dug out, washed clean one by one, and used wherever they can be used. Our soldiers do not waste a single nail. They pick up the nails scattered on the construction site one by one, pull out the useless nails hammered into the wood one by one, and then hammer them straight one by one. Even the rope ends that fall on the ground are picked up by our soldiers, split open, and twisted into new ropes.
    "Our soldiers are both workers and quality inspectors, and they hold a criticism meeting every night. Groups also frequently communicate with each other, understand each other, and support each other. Long and short materials that are useless in this group are sent to other groups. We must resolutely ensure that long materials are never used as short materials and that good materials are never used as inferior materials.
    "In construction costs, materials account for more than 70 percent, and there is a lot of room for savings. Our construction troops are models of cherishing state property and conserving raw materials. This is the main reason why we can reduce construction costs.
      "However, rework is the greatest waste. To avoid rework, we must study technology well, master technology, and let the hands that hold guns learn to hold trowels and various tools.
      "We set up a training branch in each battalion, and technicians are invited to be instructors for each type of work. Each class is a group, and each group invites two skilled workers to be instructors. We propose: 'We must unite with the instructors. If the instructors are secretive about technology, it proves that your unity work is not done well.' So, the soldiers tell the instructors war stories, read newspapers, and talk about current affairs... Some soldiers even wash the instructors' pants and empty their chamber pots—these, of course, later became 'jokes.'
    "The instructors are also enthusiastic about teaching the soldiers technology. If you don't understand, he will use all kinds of analogies to make you understand. When learning about three-line electric doors, the soldiers couldn't understand, so instructor Shen Tong built a model of a three-story building out of sorghum stalks overnight and installed wires on it to explain, and everyone understood. The soldiers loved to look at models. They said: 'Three explanations are not as good as one look.' The instructors made many models, such as office building models, dormitory models, distribution panel models..., for the soldiers to see.
      "No matter what project we do, if it does not meet the quality standards, we will resolutely rework it and never allow state property to suffer greater losses. When we rework, we never do it secretly. We always do it in a big way, inviting everyone to visit and study why it needs to be reworked. In this way, we accept the mistakes of others as our own experience. For example, the first company of a certain battalion often had honeycombs and pitted surfaces when mixing concrete. When they reworked, other companies would visit. After they visited, they did not have honeycombs and pitted surfaces when mixing concrete again.
    "The soldiers are also very enthusiastic about learning technology. Late at night, when lights are not allowed in the rooms, the soldiers read books under the moonlight and use the light from the stove to copy notes. Now, more than 80 percent of our soldiers have reached the technical standards of level three or above.
    "Now, we have reduced construction costs, but this does not mean that we have no waste at all.
    "For example, after the house is built, the steps are plastered with cement. If a soldier is not careful, he will step on the cement and damage it. We have to apply more cement, but it will be damaged again—this is 'waste.'
    "For example, we paid attention to the waste of materials, but we did not pay attention to the waste of manpower. Soldiers tend to rush in at once, causing labor stagnation. The work efficiency of our skilled workers has not reached the standard. This amounts to tens of thousands of yuan.
    "For another example—look, we installed four small electric lights in such a small room. Four light bulbs, four wires. Wouldn't it save a lot if we only installed one large electric light? Every room in our dormitory has an outlet. Why install so many? If a family lives in three rooms, does each room need to have a radio or an electric stove? — Of course, these are all design flaws. However, if our construction unit uses its brain a little and modifies the design, tens of thousands of yuan will be saved.
      "Therefore, the North China Directly Subordinate Second Construction Engineering Company said that we have reduced construction costs and saved so much. When I heard it, I was both happy and ashamed.
    "Reduced construction costs—because construction costs can be set lower. If it was set any lower, we would definitely not be able to reduce it. Not only would we not be able to reduce it, but we would also increase construction costs, because we still have waste.
    "Our conservation work is not good enough. We should pay attention to improving it in the future and achieve zero waste."

    为什么第五工区能够降低工程造价
    本报记者　刘衡
    华北直属第二建筑工程公司一九五四年曾经几次降低了工程预算造价。去年，当公司派到第五工区的建筑工程部队接到施工任务和降低工程成本的任务时，都议论开了：“包头（第五工区所在地）哪儿能跟北京、天津比？包头的材料贵，运费贵，基础深，还要安双层窗子……。”建筑单位的同志听说建筑部队要用很低的造价给他们盖那样好的房子，都半信半疑。建筑单位（甲方）和承建单位
  （乙方）订了合同后，甲方还郑重提出：“有问题早说出来，以后钱不够了，别跟我们扯皮！”
    几个月后，房子盖好了。不但保证了质量，一算账——哈，实际成本比预算造价总共还减低了百分之十二点三；混合结构的办公楼预算造价（每平方公尺，下同）是九十一元九角五分，实际成本是七十九元八角。三层混合单人宿舍预算造价是八十三元三角六分，实际成本是七十三元三角七分。有浴具设备的三层混合眷属宿舍预算造价是一百零二元，实际成本是九十二元。无浴具设备的三层混合眷属宿舍预算造价是八十六元六角二分，实际成本是八十二元五角。砖木结构的平房预算造价是六十一元，实际成本是四十九元。
    在第五工区施工的建筑工程部队听到这个消息，好不欢喜！华北直属第二建筑工程公司还表扬了他们。原先捏着一把冷汗的工程师和技术人员们也都松了一口大气，高兴地说：“跟建筑工程部队在一起，就丢不了人！”
    为什么第五工区能够减低工程造价？为什么从来没有盖过房子的建筑工程部队能够盖起又好又便宜的房子？
    第五工区的一位负责同志给我回答了这个问题，下面就是他的谈话：
      “这是一点不奇怪的，如果你深深地了解我们的战士。
    “我们的战士是最懂得爱护国家财产的，他们是一些最爱护国家财产的人。如果说，在战争的时候，为了保护国家人民的生命财产，他们不怕流血牺牲，难道说，在和平建设的时候，他们会浪费国家人民的财产？
      “突然来了一阵狂风暴雨，刮开了盖水泥垛的席子，就会有许多人急忙忙跑过去，扒在水泥垛子上面缝席子。这些人就是我们的战士。蓄水坑突然缺了一个大口子，水哗哗地往外流，就会有些人马上用自己的身体去堵口子，这些人也是我们的战士。
      “我们的战士不浪费一块砖，整砖决不碎用，碎砖决不丢弃。整砖砌墙，碎砖填心。连野外茅房里的臭烘烘的砖头都挖出来，一块块洗干净，用到能够用的地方。我们的战士不浪费一根钉子。他们把丢在工地上的钉子一根一根捡起来，把钉在木材上的没有用处的钉子一根一根拔出来，又一根一根把它捶直。连掉在地上的绳子头，我们的战士都要把它捡起来，破开后捻成新的绳子。
    “我们的战士是工人，又是检工员，每天晚上要开个批评会。组同组间还经常联系，互相了解，互相支援。在这个组里的没有用处的长料、短料就送到别组去。我们要坚决做到长材决不短用、优材决不劣用。
    “在工程造价中，材料要占百分之七十以上，里头油水很大。我们的施工部队，都是爱护国家财产、节约原材料的模范，这就是为什么我们能够降低工程造价的主要原因。
      “可是，返工就是最大的浪费，要不返工，必须好好学习技术，掌握技术，让拿枪杆的手学会拿瓦刀，拿各种工具。
      “我们每个营设一个训练分会，每一工种都请技术员当教员，每一个班就是一个组，每一个组都请两位技术工人当辅导员。我们提出：‘要好好团结辅导员，要是辅导员保守技术，就证明你的团结工作没做好。’于是，战士就给辅导员讲战斗故事，读报，谈时事……。有的战士还给辅导员洗裤子、倒尿盆——这些，以后当然变成了‘笑话’。
    “辅导员也都热情地给战士讲技术。你听不懂，他就左比方，右比方，想尽办法要让你听懂。在学习三线电门的时候，战士们听不懂，辅导员沈同压连夜用高粱秆子盖好一座三层楼房的模型，上面再安上电线讲，大家就听懂了。战士最爱看模型，他们说：‘三讲不如一看’。辅导员就做许多模型，做办公楼模型、宿舍模型、配电盘模型……，让战士看。
      “不管做什么工程，要是不合乎质量标准，就坚决返工，决不让国家财产受到更大的损失。返工的时候，决不偷偷摸摸地返，都是大张旗鼓地返。叫大家都去参观，研究为什么要返工？这样，就把别人的错误当作自己的经验接受过来了。比方，某营第一连打混凝土常会出蜂窝、麻面，返工的时候，别的连就去参观，他们参观后再打混凝土时就不出蜂窝、麻面啦。
    “战士们学习技术的劲头也很大。夜深了，屋子里不让点灯，战士们就在月亮底下看书，还利用火炉子的光抄笔记。现在，我们已经有百分之八十以上的战士达到三级工以上的技术标准。
    “现在，我们减低了工程造价，可是，这并不是说，我们已经一点浪费都没有了。
    “比方说，房子盖起来了，台阶上面抹好了水泥。战士一不小心，就会把水泥踩坏。只好再抹上些水泥，抹上后又会被踩坏——这就是‘浪费’。
    “比方说，我们注意了材料的浪费，就没注意人力的浪费。战士们动不动就一拥而上，造成人力上的窝工停工。我们技术工人的工率都没有达到标准。这里头一算账，就有好几万。
    “再比方说——你看，咱们这样一间小房子就安了四盏小电灯。四个灯头，四根电线。要是只安一盏大电灯，不要省好些？我们宿舍的每间房子都有一个插销，为什么要安那样多？如果一家人住三间房子，难道每间房子都要安一个收音机，或者是一个电炉子？——当然，这些都是设计上的毛病。可是，如果我们施工单位稍微动一动脑筋，把设计修改一下，好几万元就省下来了。
      “因此，华北直属第二建筑工程公司说我们降低了工程造价，节约了多少多少。我听了，又是高兴，又是惭愧。
    “降低了工程造价——是因为工程造价还可以订低些嘛。如果订得再低些，我们一定减低不了。不光是减低不了，还会增加工程造价，因为我们还有浪费现象。
    “我们的节约工作做得还不够好，今后还要注意改进，做到一点儿都不浪费。”
