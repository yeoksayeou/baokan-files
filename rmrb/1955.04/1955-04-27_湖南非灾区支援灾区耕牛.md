Non-Disaster Areas of Hunan Province Support Disaster Areas with Cattle

Farmers in non-disaster areas of Hunan Province are promoting the spirit of mutual aid and fraternity by selling over 12,000 head of cattle to support spring plowing for farmers in the Dongting Lake disaster areas. By the end of March, more than 4,000 head of cattle had been transported to various lakeside areas, and the remaining cattle are on their way.

Along the Xiangxi Highway, beside the Yuehan Railway stations, and at the wharves of the Yuan River and Xiang River, counties and townships have helped disaster area farmers purchasing cattle by setting up cattle sheds and care stations, preparing ample hay and bran to receive the transported oxen. Some farmers in mountainous areas, fearing that the cattle would be too tired to eat straw, specially cut freshly sprouted grass from the hillsides and sent it to the care stations. Many veterinarians also accompany the cattle transport teams, constantly checking the health of the cattle to ensure that no disease occurs during the journey.

Farmers in non-disaster areas sell their best cattle to farmers in disaster areas. Some agricultural producers' cooperatives select the fattest and strongest oxen from within the cooperative and send them to the supply and marketing cooperatives. They said, "In the past, when we were short of grain, our farmer brothers in the lake area sent boatloads of rice to support us; now we must also take out the best cattle and send them to help them restore production."

    湖南非灾区支援灾区耕牛
    湖南省非灾地区农民发扬互助友爱的精神，卖出一万二千多头耕牛，支援洞庭湖灾区农民的春耕。到三月底已有四千多头耕牛运到湖滨各地，其余耕牛正在运送途中。
    在湘西公路上、粤汉铁路车站旁、沅水和湘江码头边，各县、乡都帮助购牛的灾区农民，搭起了一座座牛棚和照料站，准备了充足的草料和细糠，接待着运来的大牯牛。有些山区农民怕牛走累了吃不下稻草，特地从山坡上割些刚刚发青的草，送到照料站来。许多兽医也伴随着运牛的队伍，随时检查耕牛的健康，保证耕牛在途中不发生病疫。
    非灾区农民把自己最好的耕牛卖给灾区农民。有些农业生产合作社选出社内膘丰肉满的大牯牛，送到供销合作社。他们说：“过去我们缺粮的时候，湖区农民弟兄送来一船船大米，支援我们；现在我们也要拿出最好的耕牛，送给他们恢复生产。”
