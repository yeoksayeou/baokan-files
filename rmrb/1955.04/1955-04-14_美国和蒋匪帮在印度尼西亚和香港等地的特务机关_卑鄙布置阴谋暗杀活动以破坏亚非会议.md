Xinhua News Agency, April 13th:

    Many Indonesian newspapers report that the U.S. and its lackey Chiang Kai-shek gang's special agencies in Indonesia, Hong Kong, and other places have long been frantically carrying out a despicable and extensive plan aimed at sabotaging the Asian-African Conference, assassinating members of the Chinese delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, creating disturbances in Indonesia, and subverting the Indonesian government.

    As early as mid-February, the "Indonesian News," published in Jakarta, published a series of reports stating that Chiang Kai-shek's special agents in Indonesia were busy contacting armed bandits in Indonesia, who were aided by the United States, to sabotage the Asian-African Conference and subvert the Indonesian government. The newspaper specifically mentioned the activities of the Chiang Kai-shek secret terrorist organization "Iron Blood Corps" in Indonesia. The newspaper said that this organization, under the guidance of Chiang Kai-shek's special agent organization, disguises itself as athletes, "Boy Scouts," and so-called "First Club members" to carry out activities. Every week, they pretend to travel to the mountains to receive Chiang Kai-shek's military training. One of the locations for this training is in Cibanas, located between Jakarta and Bandung, the site of the Asian-African Conference. The newspaper pointed out that one of the heads of the "Iron Blood Corps" is Liu Zhi, the former general of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army.

    Jakarta newspapers reported that Zheng Zhichun, the head of Chiang Kai-shek's special agents in Bandung, used the celebration of his "birthday" and his son's "wedding" in late March as an excuse to openly invite Chiang Kai-shek's special agents scattered in Indonesian cities, Japan, the Philippines, and other places to gather together, sending out five to six thousand invitations. Zheng Zhichun used the excuse of collecting gifts and having a dinner party to raise funds for Chiang Kai-shek's gang to sabotage the Asian-African Conference, and to secretly formulate their coordinated action plans in these places. "Indonesian News," in reporting this event, said: "Many Kuomintang members in Japan and the Philippines will disguise themselves as representatives and journalists attending the Asian-African Conference." The newspaper pointed out that Zheng Zhichun's large banquet was related to this infiltration of Chiang Kai-shek elements. According to Jakarta newspapers, Chiang Kai-shek elements in Hong Kong have also been continuously infiltrating into Indonesia during this period.

    Indonesian newspapers also pointed out that among the large number of American "tourists" with ambiguous identities who hurriedly came to Indonesia before the Asian-African Conference, there were elements who came to carry out sabotage activities. These numerous "tourists" all have entry visas allowing them to travel throughout Indonesia. One hundred "tourists" who were originally preparing to travel by ship to Bali, Indonesia, suddenly changed their plans in late March and took a plane directly to Jakarta and Bandung. "Indonesian News" said: Their change of plans at a time when preparations for the Asian-African Conference were actively underway aroused great suspicion.

    The Chiang Kai-shek gang's activities under the direct command of the United States are so rampant that even some American news agencies openly discussed the safety of the Chinese delegation in their dispatches. United Press International reporters in Jakarta, in two consecutive dispatches issued on March 30th and April 6th, talked about the safety of the Chinese delegation. The United Press International reporter said in a dispatch on April 6th that Chiang Kai-shek gang elements in Indonesia had "refused" to "guarantee" to the Indonesian authorities that they would not take despicable assassination measures against the Chinese delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai. In the same dispatch, this reporter attempted to absolve the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek gang of responsibility in advance, describing the assassination plan of the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek special agencies as a possible individual act.

    Indonesian public opinion demands that the Indonesian government take resolute measures to ensure the safety of the delegations of various countries and to stop the conspiracy and assassination activities of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek gang to sabotage the Asian-African Conference. The youth organization of the Indonesian National People's Party, the "National Youth League," issued a statement requesting the adoption of strong security measures to ensure the smooth progress of the Asian-African Conference. The West Java Provincial Federation of Indonesian Trade Unions also stated that people should unite to thwart any conspiracy by foreign war forces and domestic armed bandits to sabotage the conference.

### 美国和蒋匪帮在印度尼西亚和香港等地的特务机关  卑鄙布置阴谋暗杀活动以破坏亚非会议

    美国和蒋匪帮在印度尼西亚和香港等地的特务机关
    卑鄙布置阴谋暗杀活动以破坏亚非会议
    新华社十三日讯　印度尼西亚的许多报纸报道，美国和它的走狗蒋介石匪帮在印度尼西亚和香港等地的特务机关，很久以来即在狂热地执行一个卑鄙的广泛的计划，其目的在于破坏亚非会议，谋杀以周恩来总理为首的中国代表团人员，在印度尼西亚制造骚乱和颠覆印度尼西亚政府。
    在雅加达出版的“印度尼西亚新闻”早在二月中旬就发表了一连串消息说，在印度尼西亚的蒋介石特务分子正忙于同受到美国援助的印度尼西亚的武装匪徒取得联系，以破坏亚非会议并颠覆印度尼西亚政府。报纸特别提到在印度尼西亚的蒋介石秘密恐怖组织“铁血团”的活动。报纸说，这个组织是在蒋匪特务组织指导之下伪装做运动员、“童子军”和所谓“第一俱乐部会员”进行活动的。他们每星期伪装到山上旅行去接受蒋匪的军事训练。这种训练的地点之一是在吉巴纳斯，约在雅加达和亚非会议会址万隆之间。报纸指出，“铁血团”的负责人之一，就是蒋介石匪军前将领刘峙。
    雅加达报纸报道，在万隆的蒋介石特务头子郑志春在三月下旬曾以庆祝他的“生日”和他儿子的“婚礼”为名，发了五六千张请帖，公开邀集散布在印度尼西亚各城市、日本、菲律宾等地的蒋介石特务分子聚首。郑志春以收礼聚餐为名，一面为蒋介石匪帮破坏亚非会议的活动筹集经费，一面秘密拟订他们在这些地方的配合行动计划。“印度尼西亚新闻”在报道这一事件时说：“在日本和菲律宾的许多国民党分子将伪装成参加亚非会议的代表和新闻记者”。报纸指出，郑志春举行大宴会和蒋介石分子这种渗入有关。据雅加达报纸报道，香港的蒋介石分子也在这一时期，陆续不断地潜入印度尼西亚。
    印度尼西亚报纸还指出，在亚非会议前夕匆忙赶来印度尼西亚的大批身份暧昧的美国“游客”中，渗杂着前来进行破坏活动的分子。这些人数众多的“游客”都有着准予通行全印度尼西亚的入境签证。原来准备乘船到印度尼西亚峇里去的一百名“游客”在三月下旬突然改变计划，改乘飞机直接来雅加达和万隆。“印度尼西亚新闻”说：他们在正当亚非会议筹备工作积极进行的时候改变计划，引起了人们极大的怀疑。
    美国直接指挥下的蒋介石匪帮的活动猖獗到如此程度，以至一些美国通讯社也公开在它们的电讯中谈论中国代表团的安全问题。合众社驻雅加达记者在三月三十日和四月六日连续发出的两条消息中，谈到了中国代表团人员的安全问题。合众社记者四月六日的消息说，在印度尼西亚的蒋介石匪帮分子曾经“拒绝”向印度尼西亚当局“保证”不对以周恩来总理为首的中国代表团人员采取卑鄙的暗杀手段。这个记者在同一条消息中企图替美国和蒋介石匪帮预先摆脱责任，把美蒋特务机关的暗害计划说成是可能会有的个人行为。
    印度尼西亚舆论要求印度尼西亚政府采取坚决措施，保障各国代表团的安全，制止美国和蒋介石匪帮破坏亚非会议的阴谋暗杀活动。印度尼西亚国家人民党的青年组织“国家青年团”曾发表声明，要求采取有力的安全措施，以保证亚非会议能够顺利进行。印度尼西亚总工会西爪哇省分会也在声明中要求人们团结起来挫败外国战争势力和国内武装匪徒打算破坏会议的任何阴谋。
