    Throw Away the Burden
    Yao Di
    It is originally a good thing for a person to have certain advantages or possess favorable conditions for doing a good job. For example, some comrades have participated in the revolution for a longer time and have richer experience in revolutionary struggle; some comrades have a higher level of education and are quicker to accept new things; some comrades have expertise in a certain area and may be specialized talents. However, if they become arrogant and complacent because of certain advantages or favorable conditions, thinking that "I am the best in the world," then these things will not only fail to become the foundation for them to do their work well and continue to progress, but will become their burden and a stumbling block on their road forward. Comrade Mao Zedong once taught us: "There are many things that can become our burden and our liability as long as we fall into blindness towards them and lack awareness." Unfortunately, in real life, many comrades are just as Comrade Mao Zedong warned us, falling into blindness regarding their own little advantages in certain aspects, and carrying them as burdens on their backs.
    Zhou Yi, the director of the Fuzhouwan Clay Mine in Fuxian County, Liaoning Province, carried such a burden. Zhou Yi is an old cadre who has participated in the revolution for sixteen years. Participating in the revolution for a long time is certainly a good thing. Logically, the old cadre's experience in struggle should be richer and their class consciousness should be higher; they should understand the Party's principles better and be able to act according to the Party's principles more. However, Zhou Yi was not like this. On the contrary, he carried the burden of "seniority" and "contribution to the Party" and became arrogant and self-important, fundamentally not acting according to the Party's principles. He resisted the leadership and supervision of the Fuxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the general branch committee of the clay mine, and even unreasonably declared that he wanted the Fuxian County Committee to "coexist peacefully" with him and be "respectful" to him. The clay mine seriously wasted state expenditures, and when the secretary of the Fuxian County Committee asked Zhou Yi to make a self-criticism, Zhou Yi refused to do so, using "my seniority is no lower than yours" as a "reason." Zhou Yi acted arbitrarily in the clay mine, often making decisions on major issues "first before reporting," and was also seriously detached from the masses, causing many losses to the work. Is this the behavior of an old cadre? If Zhou Yi were a little more clear-headed, his more than ten years of revolutionary experience could have become a good foundation for him to rely on the Party, rely on the masses, and humbly and cautiously do a good job. As a result, because Zhou Yi carried it as a burden on his back, these more than ten years of revolutionary experience became a major obstacle to his progress.
    This cannot help but remind us that when the whole Party carried out rectification and study in 1942, it took the famous Soviet play by Korneychuk, "The Front," as compulsory reading material. Since then, Golov, the character in this play who carries the burden of being an old general from the civil war and having won four medals, stubbornly rejects all new things, and loves to "revise" other people's minds, has become a mirror for everyone. Many comrades learned lessons from Golov's failure, put down various burdens such as "great merit" and "seniority," and overcame complacency. However, as time went on, some comrades discarded this mirror, and therefore, in real life, "Golov"-like figures like Zhou Yi constantly appeared again.
    There are all kinds of burdens: the burden of "familiarity with business," the burden of "high education," the burden of "strong ability," and even the fact of having worked under a certain senior cadre has become a burden. If you want to move forward and not fall behind, no matter what kind of stuff is in your burden, you should throw it away.

    丢掉包袱
    姚堤
    一个人有某些优点，或者具备了某些做好工作的有利条件，这本来是一件好事。比如说，有的同志参加革命的时间较长，革命斗争的经验较丰富；有的同志文化程度较高；接受新鲜事物较快；有的同志有某一方面的擅长，也许是个专门人材。但是，如果因为有了某些优点或有利条件，而骄傲自大，自以为“老子天下第一”，那末，这些东西不但不能成为他们做好工作和继续进步的基础，反而会成为他们的包袱，成为他们前进道路上的绊脚石。毛泽东同志曾经教导我们：“有许多的东西，只要我们对它们陷入盲目性，缺乏自觉性，就可能成为我们的包袱，成为我们的负担。”可惜，在实际生活中，就有许多同志恰恰正是像毛泽东同志所告诫我们的一样，对自己的某些方面的一点半滴的优点陷入盲目性，把它当成包袱背在身上。
    辽宁省复县复州湾粘土矿的矿长周毅就是这样背上了包袱。周毅是一个参加革命十六年之久的老干部。参加革命时间久，这当然是一件好事。照理说，老干部的斗争经验就应该比较丰富、阶级觉悟就应该比较高；应该更懂得党的原则，更能按照党的原则办事。但是周毅却不是这样的。相反地，他背上了“资格老”、“对党有贡献”的包袱，而变得狂妄自大起来，根本不按照党的原则办事。他抗拒中共复县县委和粘土矿总支委员会的领导和监督，甚至无理地扬言，要复县县委和他“和平共处”，对他“恭敬”。粘土矿严重地浪费国家开支，复县县委书记要周毅做检讨，周毅竟然以“我的资格不比你低”为“理由”而拒不检讨。周毅在粘土矿独断专行，处理重大问题常常“先斩后奏”，而且严重地脱离群众，给工作造成很多损失。这些难道像是一个老干部的所作所为吗？如果周毅稍为清醒一点，十多年的革命经历本来可以成为他依靠党、依靠群众、谦虚谨慎地搞好工作的良好基础。结果，却因为周毅把它当做包袱背在身上，这十多年的革命经历就成了他前进的一个大障碍了。
    这就不能不使我们回忆到一九四二年全党进行整风学习时，曾把苏联柯涅楚克的著名的剧本
  “前线”作为必读的材料。从此，这个剧本中的那位背着内战时期的老将领、得过四个勋章的包袱、顽固地拒绝一切新事物，而又爱“修正”别人的脑筋的戈尔洛夫，就成为大家的一面镜子。很多同志从戈尔洛夫的失败中吸取了教训，放下了“功劳大”“资格老”等各种各样的包袱，克服了骄傲自满情绪。可是，时间久了，有些同志就把这面镜子丢掉了，因而，在实际生活中就又不断地出现像周毅这样的“戈尔洛夫”式的人物。
    包袱有各式各样的，有“业务熟悉”的包袱、
  “文化高”的包袱、“能力强”的包袱，甚至还有因为在某位高级干部领导下工作过也成了包袱。如果你要前进，不甘落后，不管你的包袱里装的什么货色，都应当丢掉。
