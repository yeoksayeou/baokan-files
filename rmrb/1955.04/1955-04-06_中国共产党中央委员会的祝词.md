To the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, forwarding to the First National Congress of the China Seamen's Union:

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China extends warm congratulations to your congress.

    Over the past few years, the nation's shipping workers, with their creative labor, have restored and developed our country's shipping industry; most capitalist shipping enterprises have also implemented joint state-private ownership, incorporating them into the state's shipping plan. The achievements in shipping have played a significant role in our country's industrial and agricultural production, commodity circulation, and national defense construction.

    Currently, the intense construction endeavors and the struggle to liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan require you to work even harder and make greater achievements.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China hopes that through this congress and the establishment of the China Seamen's Union, you will more widely and deeply mobilize the nation's shipping workers, raise their level of awareness, strengthen labor discipline, diligently learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and master new technologies; carry out criticism and self-criticism, expose errors and shortcomings in work; continue to promote the spirit of creativity, actively participate in labor emulation drives; and strive to guarantee the fulfillment and overfulfillment of state transportation tasks and various economic indicators, and strive to liberate Taiwan.

                The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

    中国共产党中央委员会向你们的大会表示热烈的祝贺。
    几年以来，全国航运职工以创造性的劳动，恢复和发展了我国的航运事业；大部分资本主义航运企业，也实行了公私合营，纳入了国家的航运计划。航运事业方面的成就，对于我国的工、农业生产、商品流转和国防建设都起了重大的作用。
    目前，紧张的建设事业和解放我国神圣领土台湾的斗争，都要求你们进一步努力工作，做出更多的成绩。
    中国共产党中央委员会希望你们经过这次大会和中国海员工会的成立，更广泛、更深入地发动全国航运职工，提高觉悟程度，加强劳动纪律，努力学习苏联先进经验，掌握新的技术；开展批评与自我批评，揭发工作中的错误和缺点；继续发扬创造精神，积极参加劳动竞赛；为保证完成与超额完成国家运输任务和各项经济指标而奋斗，为解放台湾而奋斗。
                中国共产党中央委员会
