    Workers in Shenyang and other places launch labor competitions to welcome the "May Day" holiday

    Employees in many factories in Shenyang City are launching extensive labor competitions to welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day. The molding section two of the steel casting workshop of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory decided to produce 17 more tons of castings in the labor competition to welcome "May Day". The product quality will be increased from 86% to 97%, and 90 tons of sand and 400 kilograms of nails will also be saved. To welcome the Red May, employees of Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory proposed the slogan "Manufacture tooling and fixtures to ensure the trial production of the 1A62 new product." In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient supply of fixtures, workers Wu Guiquan, Zhang Baoliang, and others in the 1A62 workshop successfully trial-produced fixtures on the bed saddle and the tailstock of the lathe, which improved labor productivity. To welcome "May Day," Shenyang Wire Factory, each workshop group carefully revised the competition conditions. The group of Liu Zhonggui and Jin Dianzhong in the rolling section of the second workshop rationally adjusted the process, so that the average daily output increased by 60%. Wu Lianguo and Zhu Xiangyou's production team of Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory proposed in the competition guarantee conditions that they would continue to study the Qiqilev tool method, reduce the defect rate from 4% to 1%, and ensure the early completion of the national plan.

    Employees of the state-owned Tianjin Power Machinery Factory are working hard to realize the guarantee conditions of the labor competition, and welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day with new production achievements. Li Yongguang, a worker in the single-car team of the First Mechanic Workshop, worked hard to study technology. He produces diesel engine parts and can complete the work quota of two days in one day. Li Zhenhua, a worker in the first fuselage team of the Second Mechanic Workshop, has exceeded his personal shift operation plan on a daily basis since participating in the competition between machine tools. Recently, he put forward a rationalization proposal to save valuable tools. To welcome the "May Day" festival, the employees of the casting workshop of Chengdu Machinery Factory guaranteed to actively find tricks and solve key production problems, and fully overfulfilled the product plan for April. The employees who built the Yellow River Bridge of the Lanzhou-Yinchuan Railway proposed to seal the bottom of the caisson in April and make the bridge pier project emerge from the water before "May Day" as a gift to the "May Day" Labor Day.
