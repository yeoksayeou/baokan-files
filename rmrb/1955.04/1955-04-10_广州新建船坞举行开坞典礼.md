    The newly built dock of the Guangzhou Shipbuilding and Repairing Plant of the Ministry of Communications held an inauguration ceremony on the 6th and was officially put into production. All the equipment in this dock is modern. The dock is equipped with new types of cold air, welding, and lighting equipment, and has two dock gate slots, which can avoid affecting production due to repairing the gate slots.
    This dock will undertake the task of repairing and building sea and river vessels in the South China coast. Prior to this, because there were no docks in South China that could repair and build large ocean-going vessels, many ocean-going vessels were gradually reduced in transportation efficiency due to years of disrepair.

    广州新建船坞举行开坞典礼
    交通部广州船舶修造厂新建的一个船坞在六日举行开坞典礼，正式投入生产。这个船坞的全部设备都是现代化的。船坞安装有新型的冷风、电焊、照明等设备，并设有两个船坞门槽，可以避免因修理门槽而影响生产。
    这个船坞将担负起华南沿海的海河船舶修造任务。在此以前，由于华南地区没有能修造大型海轮的船坞，不少海轮因年久失修，运输效率逐渐降低。　（新华社）
