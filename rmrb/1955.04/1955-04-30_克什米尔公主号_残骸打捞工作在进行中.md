Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 29th - According to a report from Singapore on the 28th by Reddy, a reporter for the "Times of India," salvage work is underway on the wreckage of the Indian aircraft "Kashmir Princess," sabotaged by U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek agents.

The report states that the salvage vessel located all four engines and the broken fuselage of the Indian aircraft on the 28th. The aircraft wreckage has been handed over to a fast patrol boat of the Indonesian Navy guarding the scene.

The report states, "According to the first news arriving in Singapore on the evening of the 28th, the engines do not appear to be badly damaged and seem to confirm the statement by Air India International that the engines were operating perfectly normally when the plane crashed. The fuselage broke open between the wings and the tail rudder. The search is continuing for the section of the right wing, where it is believed a second explosion occurred in addition to the main explosion in the baggage hold."

The report states, "No additional bodies of plane crash victims have been found."

A report by Reddy in the "Times of India," datelined Singapore, April 27th, states, "From the preliminary investigations now completed by aviation experts and intelligence officials, it appears that there were probably two explosions on the ill-fated Indian aircraft - one in the baggage hold and another in the section of the right wing. Civil aviation authorities here believe that this was clearly caused by two small time bombs secretly placed on the aircraft."

The report states, "This conclusion was reached by experts who believe that the fire that occurred in the baggage hold could not have spread so quickly to the top of the aircraft's wing section."

    “克什米尔公主号”残骸打捞工作在进行中
    新华社新德里二十九日电　据“印度时报”记者雷迪二十八日发自新加坡的消息说，打捞被美蒋特务破坏的印度飞机“克什米尔公主号”的残骸的工作正在进行中。
    消息说，打捞船已在二十八日找到了这架印度飞机的全部四个引擎和破碎的机身。飞机的残骸已被移交给守卫在出事地点的印度尼西亚海军的快速艇。
    消息说，“从二十八日晚到达新加坡的第一批消息来看，这些引擎似乎并没有受到很大的损害，并且看来证实了印度国际航空公司的这种声明：在飞机失事时，引擎的运转是完全正常的。机身在机翼和尾部方向舵之间破裂开来。目前，正在继续搜寻右翼的翼段，据相信在那里发生了除行李仓里的主要爆炸之外的第二次爆炸。”
    消息说，“仍然没有发现任何另外的飞机遇难者的尸体。”
    “印度时报”发表的雷迪在二十七日发自新加坡的消息说，“从航空专家和情报官员现在所完成的初步调查看，看来在这架遭厄运的印度飞机上大概发生了两次爆炸——一次爆炸是在行李仓中，另一次在右翼翼段中。这里民用航空当局人士认为，这显然是由秘密地安置在飞机上的两枚小的定时炸弹引起的破坏。”
    消息说，“这一结论是由专家们得出的，他们认为，在行李仓中发生的火灾不可能这样迅速就蔓延到飞机翼段的顶端。”
