Handicraft Production Cooperatives Should Serve the Needs of Farmers
Deng Jie, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Production Cooperatives

In 1954, over 3,100 iron, wood, and bamboo farm tool production cooperatives (excluding supply and marketing production cooperatives and production teams) nationwide, with over 170,000 members, produced more than 58 million farm tools, powerfully supporting agricultural production and playing the role of an assistant to state-owned industry. To adapt to the new needs of agricultural production in 1955 and to cooperate with the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement to better serve farmers' production, some handicraft production federations in various regions convened spring plowing production materials production and sales combination meetings last winter or this spring. These meetings summarized the experience of farm tool supply, production, and sales work, studied existing problems, and put forward suggestions for improvement. Some regions also convened iron industry technology exchange forums, focusing on improving production technology and learning to manufacture new products. Doing so can solve the past problems of blind production and product backlog among handicraftsmen, and can also supply farmers with the products they need in a timely manner, without delaying agricultural work; therefore, it is timely and correct. According to incomplete statistics from parts of prefectures, cities, and counties in nineteen provinces, including Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Sichuan, handicraft production cooperatives in various places have signed nearly 5,000 contracts or agreements with supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives in January and February this year, supplying over 120 kinds of large and small farm tools, totaling over 17.08 million pieces. In nineteen provinces, including Fujian, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Guizhou, Yunnan, Rehe, and Heilongjiang, handicraft production cooperatives in some regions, in coordination with supply and marketing cooperatives, organized forces to go to the countryside to repair old farm tools and new-style farm tools for farmers, which was warmly welcomed by farmers. For example, thirty-one iron and wood farm tool production cooperatives in nineteen counties, including Poyang, Dongxiang, and Huichang in Jiangxi, organized 301 members to go to the countryside to repair farm tools, saving farmers work hours. After the person in charge of the Suihua County Iron Industry Production Cooperative in Heilongjiang Province participated in a technical training class for repairing new-style farm tools, a new-style farm tool repair network was established with the Chengguan Iron Industry Production Cooperative as the repair and distribution general station and the iron industry production cooperatives in various districts as repair and distribution stations. The Changtu County Iron Industry Production Cooperative in Liaoning Province, in coordination with relevant departments, established ten new-style farm tool repair stations; the iron industry production cooperatives in Xinxiang, Anyang, Xuchang and other places in Henan Province also regard repairing and distributing new-style farm tools as one of the current central tasks.

Although farm tool production cooperatives, farm tool supply and marketing production cooperatives, supply and marketing production teams, and individual handicraftsmen in various parts of the country have achieved certain results in supporting farmers' spring plowing production, there are still many problems and shortcomings that require the leading organizations in various places to further improve the following work:

First, it is necessary to strengthen the "unified arrangement" work for individual handicraftsmen and gradually change the past phenomenon of only focusing on organized cooperatives (teams) without appropriate arrangements for individual handicraftsmen, and even squeezing them out. Because the farm tools needed by farmers still mainly rely on handicraft production, and the needs of farmers for farm tools have increased this spring with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, but the supply of farm tools is still insufficient. According to the estimate of the Finance Committee of Xishui County, Hubei, the county's handicraft production capacity can only meet 50% to 70% of the needs of farmers. Only by uniting the vast number of individual handicraftsmen and making appropriate arrangements for their supply, production, and sales can we meet the needs of farmers for developing production, and it is also conducive to guiding individual handicraftsmen to take the road of collectivization.

Second, we should pay attention to farm tool repair work. After handicraftsmen are organized in various places, they often prefer to do large-scale processing and ordering work, and are unwilling to undertake odd jobs, willing to wait for customers to come to their door, and unwilling to go to the countryside to repair old farm tools. In some areas, the red stove repair industry has been largely organized and concentrated for production, forming the phenomenon of "squeezing on one side and emptying on the other." What is squeezed is that there is more manufacturing and product backlog; what is empty is that no one cares about the repair business in the vast rural areas. According to the survey materials of Sanchengdian in Laiyang County, Shandong, the number of newly added farm tools and the number of farm tools that need to be repaired are almost equal. In Qianjiang Second District, Sichuan, many farmers line up every day to wait for the farm tool production cooperative to repair farm tools. Therefore, we should carefully summarize the experience of going to the countryside to repair farm tools, investigate the needs of farmers for repairing farm tools, and arrange this work more rationally. Handicraft leading organizations in various places should attach importance to the work of repairing and distributing new-style farm tools, and establish new-style farm tool repair stations in coordination with relevant departments according to the needs and possibilities of the region, and sign regular farm tool repair contracts with agricultural production cooperatives to facilitate farmers' use of new farm tools and ensure the completion of farmers' production increase plans.

Third, we must fully recognize the new situation in the countryside this year and understand the changes in farmers' needs for production tools at any time. First of all, we must investigate and study the new needs of agricultural mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives, and strive to produce more improved farm tools. For example, the First Iron Industry Production Cooperative in Hukou County, Jiangxi, improved the old-style plow, which can plow six and a half inches deep, one more than twice as efficient as before. The width of the furrow measures 7 inches which is two inches wider than before. It also added 6 to 7 feet of arable land in the corners. The woodworking production team in Jiujiang Seventh District changed the hand-cranked waterwheel to a foot-pedaled waterwheel, increasing the water output by 30% and also saving one labor force. Strip seeders, improved plows, improved drills, close-planting hoes, seedling transplanters, etc., which have been successfully trial-produced in various places, are all welcomed by agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups. Even a slight improvement in production tools can increase the yield of crops. Therefore, handicraft production cooperatives (teams) with conditions should strive in this direction. Secondly, we must pay close attention to the changes in the variety of farm tools needed by farmers. For example, the iron industry production cooperatives in Xinmin, Gaiping and other places in Liaoning produced a batch of small hoes according to the needs of women participating in production, and they sold very quickly; the iron industry production cooperative in Luohe City, Henan Province, studied the changes in the market's needs for farm tool varieties, and abandoned the "black goods" produced over the years and switched to producing sickles. These practices are all very good. However, we must never ignore the demands of the vast number of individual farmers for old farm tools and small farm tools, and we must pay attention to studying the different requirements for farm tool varieties and specifications in different regions, such as paddy fields, dry fields, mountain areas, and plains. The experience of "mass appraisal of products" adopted by farm tool production cooperatives in Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Jiangsu and other provinces is worth referring to in various places. Whether producing large or small, new or old farm tools, we must pay attention to ensuring specifications and quality, reducing costs, and achieving low prices and high quality. The Yangliuqing Town Iron Industry Production Cooperative in Jinghai County, Hebei Province, using unscrupulous means to pursue profits; some cooperatives (teams) in some areas producing shoddy products and falsely reporting costs are all wrong. Relevant leading organs should check and correct them in time.

Fourth, we must do a good job in combining production and sales. Leading organizations at all levels should pay close attention to the supply of raw materials for farm tool production to ensure the normal production of grassroots cooperatives. The promotion of products should mainly be done through supply and marketing cooperatives, but it can also be done directly with agricultural production cooperatives and the masses. In 1954, the Xincun Iron Industry Production Cooperative in Anyang, Henan, produced and repaired a total of 15,856 farm tools, of which 15,459 were operated through contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives, and the remaining 397 were directly repaired for farmers, achieving normal production throughout the year without a slack season. According to the specific conditions of the region, the needs and habits of the masses for farm tools, and the production capacity of the cooperatives (teams) (which should also include individual handicraftsmen in the future), Jiangsu, Heilongjiang and other places divide the supply and marketing grassroots cooperatives into several production and sales combination scopes. This is beneficial to ensuring planned production and planned supply. However, there should be no regional restrictions on foreign products that farmers have always used. Some areas mechanically implement the "three on-site" (on-site material collection, on-site processing, on-site supply), squeeze each other out, block each other, do not sell to other places, force the sale of local products, and do not repair farm tools from other places. This approach is not right. It is correct to use contracts or agreements in the combination of production and sales. In terms of price, we should adhere to the principle that production and operation are both profitable, and farmers can obtain low-priced and high-quality products. In terms of profit, we should adhere to the principle of "industry higher than commerce," refer to the sales season of products, the length of storage time of supply and marketing cooperatives, and the size of the loss ratio, negotiate with each other, and reasonably stipulate. Producers should be careful and economical in production costs and strive to increase income. Business departments should reduce operating links, avoid commodity travel and backlog to save circulation costs. In some areas, both sides argue over profits, and contracts cannot be signed for a long time, or contracts are signed but not seriously implemented, which affects farmers' production. The leading departments should pay attention to this and strengthen leadership so that the combination of production and sales can develop normally and healthily, which will be conducive to the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts.

    手工业生产合作社要为农民需要服务
    中华全国手工业生产合作社  联合总社筹备委员会副主任  邓洁
    一九五四年全国三千一百多个铁、木、竹农具生产合作社（不包括供销生产合作社和生产小组），十七万多社员，共生产了五千八百多万件农具，有力地支援了农业生产，发挥了国营工业的助手作用。为了适应一九五五年农业生产的新的需要，配合农业互助合作运动的发展，更好地为农民生产服务，部分地区的手工业生产联社在去冬或今春召开了春耕生产资料产销结合会议，总结了农具供产销工作的经验，研究了工作中存在的问题，并提出了改进的意见。有些地区还召开了铁业技术交流座谈会，着重改进生产技术和学习制造新产品。这样做既可以解决过去手工业者盲目生产、产品积压的问题，又能及时地供应农民所需要的产品，不误农时；因此是适时的、正确的。据河北、山西、山东、江苏、江西、四川等十九个省部分专区、市、县的不完全统计，今年一、二月份各地手工业生产合作社已同供销合作社、农业生产合作社签订了合同或协议近五千件，供应大、小农具一百二十多种、一千七百零八万多件。在福建、浙江、湖南、湖北、贵州、云南、热河、黑龙江等十九省内，部分地区的手工业生产合作社配合供销合作社，组织力量下乡为农民修理旧农具和新式农具，受到农民的热烈欢迎。如江西鄱阳、东乡、会昌等十九县的三十一个铁、木农具生产合作社，就组织了三百零一名社员下乡修补农具，为农民节省了工时。黑龙江省绥化县铁业生产合作社的负责人参加了修理新式农具的技术训练班后，以城关铁业生产合作社为修配总站，各区的铁业生产合作社为修配所，全县建立了新式农具修配网；辽宁省昌图县铁业生产合作社配合有关部门建立了十个新式农具修配站；河南新乡、安阳、许昌等地铁业生产合作社也都以修配新式农具作为当前中心工作之一。
    全国各地农具生产合作社、农具供销生产合作社、供销生产小组和个体手工业者在支援农民春耕生产上，虽然已经取得一定的成绩；但还存在着不少问题和缺点，需要各地管理手工业的领导机构进一步做好下列工作：
    第一、应加强对个体手工业者的“统一安排”工作，逐步改变过去只抓组织起来的社（组），对个体手工业者没有适当的安排、甚至还有排挤的现象。因为农民所需要的农具主要还须依靠手工业生产，今春农民对农具的需要随着互助合作运动的发展而增加，但农具供应还不足。据湖北浠水县财委的估计，全县手工业生产能力只能满足农民需要的百分之五十到七十。只有团结广大的个体手工业者并对其供产销进行适当的安排，才能满足农民发展生产的需要，也有利于引导个体手工业者走合作化的道路。
    第二、应该重视农具修理工作。各地手工业者组织起来后，往往愿意做大批加工订货活，不愿意承接零活，愿意等客上门，不愿下乡修理旧农具。有的地区已将红炉修理业大部组织起来，集中生产，形成“一面挤，一面空”的现象。挤的是制造业多，产品积压；空的是广大农村修理业务无人过问。据山东莱阳县三成店的调查材料，新添农具数和需要修理农具数几乎相等。四川黔江二区农具生产合作社每天有很多农民排队等待修补农具。因此应该很好总结下乡修理农具的工作经验，调查农民修理农具的需要，更合理地安排这一工作。各地手工业领导机构应该重视修配新式农具工作，根据地区需要和可能，配合有关部门，建立新式农具修配站，并同农业生产合作社订立经常的修理农具的合同，便利农民使用新农具，保证农民增产计划的完成。
    第三、要充分认识今年农村新的情况，随时了解农民对生产工具需要的变化。首先，要调查研究农业互助组和农业生产合作社的新需要，争取多生产改良的农具，如江西湖口县第一铁业生产合作社改进了旧式犁，可以深耕六寸五分，比过去效率高一倍，犁路七寸，比过去宽二寸，可多耕田角六至七尺。九江七区木器生产小组将手摇水车改为脚踏水车，输水量增加百分之三十，还节省了一个劳动力。各地已试制成功的条播机、改良犁、改良耧、密植锄、移苗器等，都受到农业生产合作社和互助组的欢迎。生产工具任何微小的改进，都能使农作物的产量有所增加。因此，有条件的手工业生产合作社
  （组），应当向这一方向努力。其次要密切注意农民对农具品种需要的变化，如辽宁新民、盖平等地铁业生产合作社根据妇女参加生产的需要，生产了一批小锄头，销售得很快；河南省漯河市铁业生产合作社研究了市场对农具品种需要的变化，就放下历年生产的“黑货”，改为生产镰刀。这些做法都是很好的。但是，也绝不能忽视广大个体农民对旧农具、小农具的要求，并且要注意研究不同地区的耕作习惯，水田、旱田、山地、平地对农具品种规格的不同要求。辽宁、黑龙江、江苏等省农具生产合作社采用“群众鉴定产品”的经验，是值得各地参考的。无论生产大小、新旧农具，都必须注意保证规格质量，降低成本，做到价廉物美。河北省静海县杨柳青镇铁业生产合作社，不择手段、追求利润；有的地区有些社（组）粗制滥造，虚报成本，都是错误的。有关领导机关应该及时检查纠正。
      第四、要做好供产销结合工作。各级领导机构应密切注意农具生产的原材料供应，保证基层社正常生产。在产品推销上主要应通过供销合作社，但也可同农业生产合作社和群众直接见面。河南安阳辛村铁业生产合作社一九五四年共生产和修理农具一万五千八百五十六件，通过供销合作社合同经营一万五千四百五十九件，其余三百九十七件是直接替农民修理的，已做到全年无淡季，生产正常。江苏、黑龙江等地根据地区的具体情况，群众对农具的需要和习惯，社（组）的生产能力（今后并应包括个体手工业），把供销基层社划分为几个产销结合范围，这样做对于保证计划生产、计划供应是有好处的。但对于农民一向使用的外地产品，不应受地区的限制。有些地区机械地执行“三就”（就地取材、就地加工、就地供应），彼此排挤，互相封锁，不向外地销售，硬销本地货，不修理外地来的农具，这种做法是不对的。产销结合采用合同或协议的方式是正确的。在价格上应遵守生产、经营都有利，农民又能得到价廉物美的产品为原则。在利润上应本着“工高于商”的原则，参照产品的销售季节，供销社储备时间的长短，损耗比例的大小，彼此协商，合理规定。生产者应精打细算、节约生产费用，争取增加收入。业务部门应从减少经营环节、避免商品旅行、积压，以节约流转费用。有些地区双方争执利润，长期订不出合同，或者订了合同不认真执行，以致影响了农民的生产。领导部门应当引起注意，加强领导，使产销结合能正常健康地发展，才能有利于对农业和手工业的社会主义改造。
