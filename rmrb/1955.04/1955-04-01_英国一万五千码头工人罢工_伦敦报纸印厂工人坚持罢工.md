    Xinhua News Agency, London, March 31st: A report from London states that 15,000 dockworkers in the major ports of Liverpool and Manchester began a strike on the 28th, and were still persisting on the 30th. The strike has brought the loading and unloading work of over one hundred ships to a standstill.
    The reason for the strike is that the dockworkers in the above two locations are dissatisfied with the persecution of the Dockworkers' Union by the right-wing trade union leaders of the British Trades Union Congress and the local labor authorities, and oppose their conspiracy to undermine the unity of the dockworkers. In this strike struggle, dockworkers participating in the Transport and General Workers' Union acted in unison with dockworkers participating in the Dockworkers' Union, disregarding the will of the right-wing trade union leaders.
    Meanwhile, the strike by printing workers of twenty-four national newspapers in London, demanding wage increases, entered its sixth day on the 30th. Despite the insidious instigation and threatening tactics adopted by the capitalists, the striking workers expressed their determination to persist in the struggle. It is estimated that the total sales of these twenty-four newspapers are over 50 million copies.

    英国一万五千码头工人罢工
    伦敦报纸印厂工人坚持罢工
    新华社三十一日讯  伦敦消息：英国利物浦和曼彻斯特两大港口的一万五千名码头工人从二十八日开始举行罢工，到三十日还在坚持中。罢工使得一百多艘船只的装卸工作陷于停顿。
    罢工的原因是上述两地的码头工人不满英国职工大会右翼工会头子和当地劳工当局迫害码头工人工会，反对他们破坏码头工人团结的阴谋。在这次罢工斗争中，参加运输与普通工人工会的码头工人不顾右翼工会头子的意志，同参加码头工人工会的码头工人一致行动。
    同时，伦敦二十四家全国性报纸的印刷厂工人因为要求增加工资而举行的罢工，到三十日已进入第六天。尽管资方采取了阴险的挑拨和威胁手段，罢工工人还是表示决心坚持斗争。据估计，这二十四家报纸的销售总额在五千万份以上。
