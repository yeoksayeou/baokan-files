Factory and Mining Enterprise Administration Should Directly Manage Workers' Spare-Time Education
    ——The Experience of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant in Running Workers' Spare-Time Schools
    Zhang Minshan, Ya Rongguang

    The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant established a workers' spare-time school in 1950. By the end of 1953, the number of students accounted for 40% of the total number of employees, of which students in the senior primary class and junior middle school class accounted for 64.8% of the total number of students. This initially changed the cultural outlook of the workers, creating favorable conditions for further improving their cultural level and systematically learning more complex technologies.

    With the rapid development of national socialist industrialization, factories are increasingly equipped with modern equipment, urgently requiring the improvement of workers' technical level to adapt to the development of production. At the same time, with the development of production, workers' spare-time cultural education has also undergone great changes: the number of literacy class students has relatively decreased, while the number of senior primary and junior middle school class students has increased day by day. After shaking off illiteracy and possessing a certain level of culture, the broad masses of workers not only demand to continue learning culture, but also actively demand to learn technology. Therefore, workers' spare-time cultural education has raised a new issue for us: How to closely integrate cultural education and technical education? To solve this problem, it is first necessary to adapt to the new situation and change the leadership relationship of workers' spare-time education.

    The leadership relationship of workers' spare-time education in Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has changed many times in recent years, experiencing several stages. From the analysis of these stages, it can be seen what kind of leadership relationship is suitable for workers' spare-time education.

    The first stage (before 1953): All workers' spare-time cultural education in the plant was directly led by the trade union. At that time, production had not yet been brought into order, and the number of people participating in learning was small (most of whom were students in literacy and elementary primary classes), and the contradiction between workers' cultural level and technology was not obvious enough. The trade union's leadership of workers' spare-time cultural education has made some achievements.

    The second stage: Division of leadership between the administration and the trade union. After the literacy work was rectified in 1953, in order to solve the problem of how to combine cultural education and technical education, the classes above junior middle school were handed over to the administrative technical education section for leadership; the classes below senior primary school were still led by the trade union. After doing this for a year, not only was the problem not solved, but on the contrary, because the entire plant's workers' spare-time cultural education was mechanically divided, many new problems occurred. For example, as the school expanded day by day, the trade union, due to insufficient leadership, often neglected one thing for another, especially the political and ideological leadership of teachers. Secondly, the senior primary classes led by the trade union could not guarantee the learning time for a long time. In 1953, only 80 hours of classes were actually held throughout the year, and the remaining 40 hours of learning time were occupied by other activities, which seriously affected the quality of teaching. On the other hand, the junior middle school classes led by the administration basically guaranteed the learning time. At the same time, because the administration and the trade union each had their own system, there were often phenomena of mutual involvement, and the school system and curriculum were not well connected. Graduates at all levels could not be promoted in time, affecting the consolidation of learning results and producing a large number of repeaters and dropouts. This shows that the form of direct leadership by the trade union or division of leadership between the administration and the trade union can no longer meet the requirements of the current workers' spare-time education work.

    The third stage: Direct leadership by the enterprise administration. In order to completely change the above situation and put workers' spare-time cultural education work on the right track, in May 1954, the Party Committee decided to hand over this work to the enterprise administration for direct leadership and include it in the plant's training plan; the trade union actively assisted in this work (mainly carrying out organizational mobilization work and checking the learning situation of employees). The teaching and research section of the workers' spare-time school, the technical training class, and the political training class were merged into one to form the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Workers' School, becoming a comprehensive school of politics, culture, and technology. It is directly under the leadership of the plant director (who also serves as the school principal) who is in charge of personnel management, and the administration is equipped with a full-time vice principal. Under the leadership of the principal, there is a principal's office, which is divided into three teaching and research sections: technology, spare time, and separation from production. The spare-time teaching and research section also established three education groups according to literacy, primary school, and middle school to specifically be responsible for class management and guidance of part-time teachers. In addition, a teaching and research office was established to be responsible for the teaching and research work of the entire school. Party branches, Communist Youth League branches, and trade union branches were established within the school. The allocation and management of the school's faculty and staff are uniformly handled by a dedicated person in the personnel section. This strengthens grassroots leadership. At present, all the work of the school is the responsibility of the principal, and the principal responsibility system is implemented. The principal is also a member of the Party Committee, and when major problems occur, he can raise them to the Party Committee for research and decision, which is then implemented by the administration. According to regulations, 40% of the school's funds are drawn from the trade union's cultural and educational funds, and the enterprise makes up for the shortfall.

    After more than ten months of exploration, it has been proven that there are many advantages to enterprises running schools, which are:

    First, it achieves unified leadership of culture and technology education. The school can put forward cultural and technical training plans based on the development of production in the entire plant, so that workers' cultural education is closely integrated with production work and directly and effectively serves production. At the same time, the problem of combining culture and technology has also been initially solved: workers who have not reached the level of senior primary school or cadres who have not reached the level of junior middle school all participate in cultural learning. After graduating from senior primary school, some students transfer to junior technical classes to learn general technical knowledge, and some students are promoted to junior middle school classes to learn general cultural courses. After graduating from junior middle school, some students transfer to intermediate technical studies, and some students are promoted to senior high school classes to continue to improve their cultural level in preparation for entering universities in the future. Due to the unified planning of the cause and the connection of courses, it not only closely integrates cultural education and technical education, but also can take overall consideration of spare-time learning and learning separated from production.

    Second, it basically guarantees the learning time of employees. Because the school is directly led by the enterprise administration, it is possible to uniformly arrange the time for learning, production, and various meetings and activities based on the overall plan and the central work of each period. In order to quickly and effectively improve the cultural level of workers, from 1955, the workers' spare-time cultural learning time in Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has been increased to six hours per week.

    Third, it fundamentally solves the learning problems of grassroots cadres and activists. After the enterprise ran the school, the leadership, based on the characteristics of grassroots cadres and activists, separately organized them into classes and selected outstanding teachers to take on teaching work. For grassroots cadres who cannot participate in spare-time learning, they are equipped with deputies to hold learning classes separated from production for them, and they are transferred from production in batches for learning.

    Fourth, the school's faculty and staff are uniformly allocated and managed by the personnel section, and teaching and research organizations have been established. This overcomes the difficulty of insufficient teachers and strengthens teaching and research work; it also creates certain conditions for training teachers and improving teaching quality. It is precisely because the leadership is unified, the time is guaranteed, and the school has full-time cadres responsible for leading teaching that remarkable achievements have also been made in improving teaching and raising the level of teachers. In addition, the issue of the time for part-time teachers to participate in teaching and research has also been largely resolved. The plant director once instructed leaders at all levels to set aside one and a half hours of work time each week to allow part-time teachers to participate in the school's teaching and research. The solution to this problem is an important condition for improving teaching work and improving teaching quality.

    Fifth, uniformly hire part-time teachers, and uniformly adjust and use classrooms and teaching aids. In the past, there were often disputes between the trade union and the administration when hiring teachers. Often, university graduates taught senior primary classes, while junior high school graduates taught junior high school classes; classrooms and teaching aids could not be fully utilized, resulting in a great waste. Now, part-time teachers are uniformly hired by the school, and classrooms, teaching aids, and funds are all planned by the school, uniformly allocated, and rationally used. This overcomes the previous phenomenon of scattered waste and mutual involvement.

    In short, there are many benefits to enterprises running schools. The result of adopting this method has solved the problems that workers' spare-time education has not solved for several years, and combined workers' spare-time cultural education with technical education, so that workers' spare-time cultural education in Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has initially embarked on a regularized path.

    厂矿行政要直接管理职工业余教育工作
    ——太原钢铁厂举办职工业余学校的经验
    张岷山　轧荣光
    太原钢铁厂在一九五○年创办了职工业余学校。到一九五三年底，学员已经占职工总数百分之四十，其中高小班、初中班学员占学员总数百分之六十四点八。这样就初步改变了职工群众的文化面貌，为进一步提高职工的文化水平和系统地学习较为复杂的技术，创造了有利条件。
    随着国家社会主义工业化的迅速发展，工厂现代化的设备日渐增多，急需提高职工的技术水平，以适应生产的发展。同时，随着生产的发展，职工业余文化教育工作也发生了很大变化：扫除文盲班学员相对减少，高小班和初中班学员日益增加。广大职工在摆脱文盲状态，具有一定文化水平以后，不仅要求继续学习文化，而且积极要求学习技术。因而职工业余文化教育对我们提出了一个新的课题：文化教育和技术教育怎样紧密结合？要解决这个问题，首先需要适应新的情况，改变职工业余教育的领导关系。
    太原钢铁厂职工业余教育的领导关系，几年来已经改变多次，经历了几个阶段。从这几个阶段的分析当中，可以看到职工业余教育的领导关系究竟怎样才算合适。
    第一阶段（一九五三年以前），全厂职工业余文化教育是由工会直接领导的。当时生产尚未纳入正轨，参加学习的人数不多（其中绝大部分是扫除文盲初小班学员），职工文化水平和技术不相适应的矛盾表现得还不够明显。职工业余文化教育工作由工会领导，曾做出了些成绩。
    第二阶段，由行政和工会分工领导。一九五三年扫除文盲工作经过整顿以后，为了解决文化教育和技术教育如何结合的问题，将初中以上的班次，交由行政技术教育科领导；高小以下的班次仍归工会领导。这样做了一年，不仅问题未得到解决，相反的，由于把整个厂的职工业余文化教育工作机械地分割开来，发生了不少新的问题。例如，学校日益扩大，工会因领导力量不足，往往有些顾此失彼，特别是对教师的政治思想领导，更是顾不过来。其次，工会领导的高小班，学习时间长期得不到保证，一九五三年全年实际仅上了八十个小时的课，其余有四十个小时学习时间，被别的活动占用了，因而严重地影响了教学质量。而在行政方面领导的初中班，基本上保证了学习时间。同时，由于行政、工会各搞一套，常有互相牵扯的现象，学制课程也不大衔接，各级毕业学员不能及时升级，影响了学习成果的巩固，产生了大量回生和掉队现象。这说明由工会直接领导或行政同工会分工领导的形式，已经不能适应当前职工业余教育工作的要求。
      第三阶段，由企业行政方面直接领导。为了彻底改变上述情况，并将职工业余文化教育工作纳入正轨，一九五四年五月间党委决定，将这一工作交给企业行政方面直接领导，列入全厂培养训练计划之内；工会则积极协助这一工作（主要是进行组织动员工作，检查职工的学习情况）。并把职工业余学校教导处、技术训练班和政治轮训班合而为一，组成太原钢铁厂职工学校，成为一所政治、文化、技术的综合学校。直属管理人事的厂长领导（兼任学校校长），由行政方面配备了专职副校长。下设校长办公室，内分技术、业余、脱离生产三个教导处，由校长统一掌握。业余教导处并按扫除文盲、小学、中学成立三个教育组，专门负责班级管理和辅导兼职教师。此外，还建立了教学研究室，负责全校的教学研究工作。在校内建立了党支部和青年团支部、工会分会。学校教职员的调配管理，统由人事科设专人负责。这就加强了基层领导。目前学校一切工作均由校长负责，贯彻了校长责任制。而正校长又是党委委员，发生重大问题时，他可以把它提到党委会研究后做出决定，由行政方面贯彻执行。学校经费按规定从工会文教费中抽出百分之四十拨给学校，不足之数由企业方面包干补助。
    经过十个多月的摸索，证明企业办学有很多的优点，这就是：
    第一、做到了文化和技术教育的统一领导。学校可以根据全厂生产发展情况，提出文化、技术的培养训练计划，这样就使职工文化教育同生产工作紧密地结合在一起，并直接有效地为生产服务。与此同时，文化和技术结合问题，也初步得到解决：凡不及高小程度的工人或不及初中程度的干部，一律参加文化学习。高小毕业后，部分学员转入初级技术班，学习普通的技术知识，部分学员升入初中班，学习普通文化课。初中毕业后，部分学员转入中级技术学习，部分学员升入高中班，继续提高文化水平，为今后升入高等学校做准备。由于事业计划统一，课程衔接，不仅把文化教育和技术教育密切结合起来，而且能对业余学习和脱离生产学习统筹兼顾。
    第二、基本上保证了职工的学习时间。由于学校是由企业行政直接领导的，就有可能根据全面计划和各个时期的中心工作，统一安排学习、生产和各种会议活动的时间。为了迅速有效地提高职工文化水平，从一九五五年起，太原钢铁厂职工业余文化学习时间，每周已增加为六小时。
    第三、从根本上解决了基层干部和积极分子的学习问题。企业办学以后，领导方面根据基层干部和积极分子的特点，将他们单独编班，选派优秀教师，担任教学工作。对不能参加业余学习的基层干部，则给他们配备副职，为他们举办脱离生产学习班，分期分批地抽调他们脱离生产进行学习。
    第四、学校教职员统一由人事科调配和管理，而且建立了教学研究组织，这就克服了教师不足的困难，加强了教学研究工作；同时也为培养教师，提高教学质量，创造了一定条件。正是由于领导统一，时间有了保证，学校又有专职干部负责领导教学，所以在改进教学提高教师水平方面，也获得了显著成绩。另外，兼职教师参加教学研究的时间问题，也大都得到解决。厂长曾指示各级领导人员，每周必须从工作时间里抽出一小时半的时间，让兼职教师参加学校的教学研究。这个问题的解决，是改进教学工作，提高教学质量的重要条件。
    第五、统一聘请兼职教师，统一调剂、使用教室、教具。过去工会和行政方面对聘请教师时常发生争执，往往大学毕业生有教高小班的，而初中毕业生却教初中班；教室、教具也不能充分利用，形成很大的浪费现象。现在，兼职教师统由学校聘请，教室、教具和经费，均由学校通盘筹划，统一调配，合理使用。这就克服了以往分散浪费，相互牵扯的现象。
    总之，企业办学的好处是很多的。采用这种办法的结果，解决了职工业余教育几年来没有解决的问题，使职工业余文化教育和技术教育结合起来，使太原钢铁厂的职工业余文化教育初步走上了正规化的道路。
