Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions

    Wanxian Department Store Suspends Mail Order Business
    Yang Lin and Gong Xilian of the Industry and Commerce Section of the Wanxian Special District Commissioner's Office in Sichuan Province wrote: “On February 13, the People's Daily published Comrade Kong Tu's article on 'Wanxian Department Store Disregarding State-Owned Reputation,' criticizing us for not implementing the instructions of the Central Ministry of Commerce regarding the cessation of mail-order business by state-owned enterprises, disrupting leather management and regional commodity sales plans, and damaging the reputation of state-owned commerce. These opinions are correct, and the nature of the problem is serious. The fact that these serious problems were not corrected in time by the Wanxian Department Store is not only the company's responsibility, but also ours. First, we did not earnestly supervise and inspect the implementation of higher-level policies by various departments; second, we did not pay enough attention to and handle carefully the criticisms from the masses.
    We sincerely accept Comrade Kong Tu's criticism and are determined to strengthen our policy and business studies, overcome bureaucracy, and improve our future work."
                    ×××
    Gu Yinqing, manager, and Lin Hongxun, deputy manager of the China Department Store Sichuan Provincial Company Wanxian Branch, wrote to express their sincere acceptance of Comrade Kong Tu's criticism and conducted a re-examination.
    Gu Yinqing said: "Handling mail-order leather shoe business, blindly expanding sales, and failing to guarantee product quality to meet customer needs have damaged the reputation of the state-owned enterprise. This is a manifestation of our serious capitalist management thinking.
    Our bureaucratic work style is also serious. We lacked regular supervision and inspection of the department managing mail-order leather shoes. The system of collecting payments and reporting goods was unsound, giving corrupt and degenerate elements the opportunity to engage in malfeasance. As a result, phenomena such as wrong colors, wrong sizes, wrong styles, and failure to allocate goods in the order of payment receipt occurred continuously, causing undue losses to customers."
    The following measures were taken regarding the mail-order leather shoe business:
    1. The mail-order leather shoe business has been suspended since December 1954;
    2. Zhang Tingyun, a person who embezzled, committed fraud, and theft in our company's leather shoe sales, has been arrested and dealt with by the People's Court;
    3. In order to strengthen the political and ideological education of employees, we are now organizing all comrades to study Comrade Kong Tu's criticism materials against our company, and in conjunction with other issues, conduct in-depth inspections to correct errors, improve business management, and better serve consumers.

    Review of Blind Demolition
    The Basic Construction Office of the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee wrote: "On January 30, Lin Shuang'er raised criticisms of Wuhan's demolition work in the 'Letters from Readers' page of the People's Daily. We immediately urged the Real Estate Management Bureau, which is in charge of this business, to conduct an inspection.
    In recent years, there have been many shortcomings and errors in Wuhan's demolition work. In addition to what the reader pointed out, there are many other similar situations. The Real Estate Management Bureau is one of the main agencies responsible for demolition work and should bear a great responsibility for this.
    The main reason for residents being relocated again and again is that urban planning cannot keep up with the needs of construction, and the selection of relocation sites is somewhat blind.
    We have also not paid enough attention to the resettlement of the lives and occupations of relocated households. Cadres handling land requisition work often simply pay money and are unwilling to do more detailed work, and sometimes even have a harsh attitude. This not only creates a bad influence among the masses but also hinders the smooth progress of land requisition work.
    The Real Estate Management Bureau has humbly accepted this criticism, strengthened the ideological education of cadres, and will do a good job in future work."

  Taiyuan Iron Factory Formulates Measures to Correct Overtime Work
    Wang Derong, Deputy Director of the Taiyuan Iron Factory, wrote: "The criticism by reader Ren Shuzhang in the People's Daily on February 20 regarding the serious overtime phenomenon in the Taiyuan Iron Factory is completely correct.
    We have realized that in the past, simply focusing on completing production tasks and ignoring the health of employees was a violation of national labor policies and a manifestation of capitalist management thinking. If these problems are not thoroughly overcome, they will inevitably cause significant losses to the country.
    In addition to sincerely accepting criticism, we plan to take the following measures in the future to overcome the overtime phenomenon: (1) conscientiously study labor policies and educate all employees to earnestly implement them; (2) strengthen enterprise management, overcome chaotic phenomena, and formulate the scope of responsibilities of functional departments and work sections in March to prevent mutual buck-passing and irresponsibility; (3) improve work plans and scheduling to overcome the unevenness of work and waste of labor in production; (4) continue to carry out labor competitions to stimulate the enthusiasm of employees for production and ensure the completion of national tasks."

    The Problem of Coal for Workers at Longyan Mine Has Been Resolved
    The former Hebei Provincial Finance and Economics Committee wrote: "The letter 'It is necessary to immediately supply coal for the lives of workers at the Longyan Iron Mine' published in the 'Letters from Readers' page of the People's Daily on December 26 last year was investigated by the Xuanhua Municipal Finance and Economics Committee and found to be correct. The relevant departments have dealt with it.
    The main reason for the shortage of coal for the lives of workers at the Longyan Iron Mine in the fourth quarter of last year was that the Longyan Iron Mine frequently accumulated heavy trains. The Zhangjiakou Railway Bureau, citing the large amount of goods stored at Pangjiabao Station and the lack of cargo space, refused to dispatch trains. Therefore, coal could not be transported to the Longyan Iron Mine.
    Although the Hebei Provincial Company of China Coal Industry Building Materials Company knew that supplying coal for the lives of workers at the Longyan Iron Mine was an important task, it sent cadres to contact and negotiate in all directions when the Railway Bureau refused to dispatch trains, but because it did not find the key agency, the problem could not be resolved in a timely manner.
    Currently, relevant departments have formed a joint office at Pangjiabao Station, responsible for controlling transportation and supply work. The problem of supplying coal for the lives of employees has been completely resolved."

    Wuhu City Improves Management of Tiger Bridge
    The Wuhu Municipal People's Government wrote: "The criticism in the 'Letters from Readers' page of the People's Daily on January 23, 'Tiger Bridge is a scourge of Wuhu City,' shows that we did not sufficiently recognize the seriousness of boating accidents. We have now convened a meeting of relevant units to study and decided to first strengthen and improve the management of the pontoon bridge on the existing basis to prevent collisions with ships; we are preparing to allocate a lifeboat to the pontoon bridge management office in case of emergency. At the same time, we will strengthen safety education for passing ships, maintain and improve local land and water traffic order. As for the construction of a permanent bridge, there are still many issues that need further study."

专栏：批评建议的反应

    批评建议的反应
    万县百货公司停办邮购业务
    四川省万县专区专员公署工商科杨林、宫锡琏来信：二月十三日人民日报发表孔突同志关于“不顾国营信誉的万县百货公司”一文，批评我们不执行中央商业部关于国营企业停止函购业务的指示，破坏了皮革管理和打乱了地区商品推销计划，败坏了国营商业的信誉。这些意见是正确的，问题的性质也是严重的。这些严重问题在万县百货公司没有及时纠正，除了公司应负责任外，我们也有责任。第一、我们没有认真的督促和检查各部门贯彻上级的政策；第二、我们对来自群众中的批评没有引起足够的重视和慎重的处理。
    我们诚恳地接受孔突同志的批评，决心加强政策和业务学习，克服官僚主义，改进今后工作。
                    ×××
    中国百货公司四川省公司万县分公司经理顾印庆、副经理林鸿勋来信表示诚恳地接受孔突同志的批评，并重新作了检查。
    顾印庆说：办理邮售皮鞋业务，盲目扩大推销，又不能保证产品质量，满足顾客需要，以致破坏国营信誉。这都是我们严重的资本主义经营思想的表现。
    我们的官僚主义作风也是严重的，我们对经管邮售皮鞋部门缺乏经常的督促检查，收款报货制度不健全，给贪污蜕化分子有了舞弊的机会，因而错色、错码、错式样，不按款到先后次序拨货的现象不断发生，使顾客遭受不应有的损失。
    对于邮售皮鞋业务作如下处理：
    1、从一九五四年十二月份起已停止皮鞋邮售业务；
    2、对我公司卖皮鞋从中贪污舞弊破坏盗窃分子张廷鋆已由人民法院逮捕法办；
    3、为了加强职工政治思想教育，现正根据孔突同志对我公司的批评材料，组织全体同志学习，并结合别的问题，进行深入的检查，以便纠正错误，改善经营管理，更好地为消费者服务。
    关于盲目拆迁的检讨
    武汉市人民委员会基本建设办公室来信：一月三十日人民日报“读者来信专页”上林双尔对武汉市的拆迁工作提出批评，我们当即督促主管这项业务的房地产管理局进行检查。
    几年来，武汉市的拆迁工作是存在着不少缺点和错误的。除了读者指出的以外，其他类似情况还不少。房地产管理局是负责拆迁工作的主要机关之一，对此应负很大的责任。
    造成居民一迁再迁的主要原因，是由于城市规划赶不上建设的需要，在迁建地点的选择上带有盲目性。
    我们对搬迁户的生活、职业的安置也重视不够。办理征用土地的工作干部，往往只图简单拨钱了事，而不愿做更细致的工作，甚至有时态度生硬。这样，不但在群众中造成不良影响，而且阻碍了征用土地工作的顺利进行。
    房地产管理局已虚心接受这一批评，加强对干部的思想教育，做好今后的工作。
  太原铁工厂订出纠正加班的办法
    太原铁工厂副厂长王德荣来信：二月二十日人民日报读者任树章对太原铁工厂加班现象严重的批评是完全正确的。
    我们已经认识到过去单纯为了完成生产任务，忽视职工身体健康，是一种违犯国家劳动政策的行为，是资本主义的经营思想的表现。这些毛病如果不彻底克服，势必给国家造成重大的损失。
    我们除了诚恳接受批评外，今后拟采取下列措施，克服加班现象：（一）认真学习劳动政策，教育全体职工认真执行；（二）加强企业管理，克服混乱现象，在三月份订出职能科和工段的职权范围，防止互相推诿，不负责任；（三）搞好作业计划和调度工作，克服生产中的忙闲不均和窝工现象；
  （四）继续开展劳动竞赛，启发职工的生产积极性，保证国家任务的完成。
    龙烟矿工用煤问题已经解决
    前河北省财经委员会来信：去年十二月二十六日人民日报“读者来信专页”刊登“必须立即供应龙烟铁矿工人的生活用煤”一信，经宣化市财经委员会调查，这一批评是正确的。有关部门已经予以处理。
    造成龙烟铁矿去年第四季度生活用煤脱销的原因，主要是龙烟铁矿经常积压重车，张家口铁路分局借口庞家堡车站存货很多，没有货位，拒绝发车。因此，煤炭无法运到龙烟铁矿。
    中国煤业建筑器材公司河北省公司虽然知道供应龙烟铁矿生活用煤是一项重要任务，在路局不肯发车的情况下，曾派干部四出联系、交涉，但因为没有找到关键所在的机关，问题不能及时解决。
    目前有关部门已在庞家堡站组成联合办公室，负责掌握运输供应工作，职工生活用煤的供应问题，已经得到彻底解决。
    芜湖市改进对老虎桥的管理
    芜湖市人民政府来信：一月二十三日人民日报
  “读者来信专页”刊载的“‘老虎桥’是芜湖市的祸害”的批评，说明了我们对于划船失事的严重性认识不足。现在我们已召集有关单位开会研究，决定先在现有基础上加强和改进浮桥的管理，防止船只碰撞；准备拨给浮桥管理处救生艇一只，以备万一。同时，加强对过往船只的安全教育，维护和改进当地水陆交通秩序。至于建设永久性的桥梁，还有很多问题需要进一步研究。
