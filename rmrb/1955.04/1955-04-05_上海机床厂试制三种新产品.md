The state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, after successfully trial-producing a Soviet-style 3161 cylindrical grinder in January, recently completed two new Soviet-style grinders between March 23rd and 26th. One is the Soviet-style CK 371 surface grinder, which is exquisite and flexible with high precision. When grinding workpieces with it, the tolerance within 500 micrometers is only half a thread. The other is the Soviet-style 3430 semi-automatic camshaft grinder, a specialized grinder for peach shafts on high-precision automobile and tractor engines. It is automatically controlled by electricity and oil, making it easy to operate. The worker only needs to clamp the workpiece onto the machine, and it will automatically grind until the processing requirements are met. The infeed, retraction, and reciprocation are all automatic.

    上海机床厂试制三种新产品
    国营上海机床厂在一月份试制成功一种苏式3161外圆磨床以后，最近又在三月二十三日至二十六日先后完成了两台苏式新型磨床。一种是苏式CK 371型平面磨床，这种磨床精巧灵活，精密度很高，用它磨制工作物，五百米厘以内公差仅有半丝。另一种是苏式3430半自动化凸轮轴磨床，是磨制精密度较高的汽车和拖拉机引擎上桃子轴的专用磨床。它是用电气和油液自动控制，操作简便，工人只要把工作物夹在机器上，它就能自动磨削，直到达到加工要求为止，进刀、退刀、往复都是自动的。
