    In the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    Soviet Workers Launch Socialist Emulation Drive to Greet May Day
    The "Sickle and Hammer" Steel Plant in Moscow's May Day emulation is closely linked to increasing labor productivity and completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The workers of the plant's No. 450 rolling mill overproduced 800 tons of steel in nearly 20 days in March, and labor productivity increased by 15 percent compared to last year.
    Enterprises in various union republics have also joined the emulation activities. The Minsk Tractor Plant's entire staff participated in the emulation. The diesel engine workshop increased labor productivity by 10 to 15 percent in the first few days after the start of the emulation, compared to before the emulation.
    Various key construction sites have also been caught up in the emulation boom. The construction workers of the Kubyshev Hydroelectric Power Station's spillway dam launched a May Day emulation drive.
    Soviet Youth Collect Scrap Metal to Support National Construction
    Local organizations of the Communist Youth League of the Soviet Union have mobilized members of the Communist Youth League, youth, and Young Pioneers to collect scrap metal to support national construction.
    Members of the Communist Youth League and young people in Moscow participated in scrap metal collection on Sunday, March 27th, collecting a total of 3,000 tons of scrap metal.
    A total of 45,000 young people from factories, offices, and schools in Moscow participated in the day's scrap metal collection work. They collected scrap iron and steel in their factories, on the streets and construction sites, in forgotten corners and in unmelted snowdrifts. Several hundred young workers from the Stalin Automobile Factory collected 160 tons of scrap metal in one day. Young people from the Red Warrior Factory collected 10 tons of scrap metal in half a day in their factory and nearby streets. In the Kubyshev District, young people from the Central Union of Consumer Cooperatives of the Soviet Union, the Mining Institute, and other offices and schools started working at 8 am, focusing on courtyards and basements on the streets. They also collected a considerable amount of scrap metal in one day.
    Reception points have been set up to receive scrap metal from various places. One reception point received 700 tons of scrap metal in one day. This amount of scrap metal can be used to manufacture more than 100 tractors after smelting.
    New Highway of Over 500 Kilometers Opens in Korea
    Starting in March of this year, a new highway with a total length of 517 kilometers has been opened in seven sections in Korea (including the Haeju-Ongjin line).
    In 1954, the total length of highways in Korea increased 3.37 times compared to 1953, and new highways were opened in five sections (including the Chongjin-Najin line), and almost all major highways were extended. The number of passengers was 14 times that of 1953, exceeding the pre-war level by four times.
    Rapid Development of Non-Ferrous Metal Mining and Smelting Industry in Poland
    Poland's non-ferrous metal mining and smelting industry has developed rapidly in recent years. Now, Poland is able to produce large quantities of non-ferrous metals such as copper, aluminum, and nickel, which could not be produced before liberation. Poland's zinc production has more than quadrupled since before liberation, making it one of the world's major zinc-producing countries.
    Poland's zinc and lead mining base has been further developed. The mining volume of zinc and lead mines in the Olkusz-Herzanow region of Krakow Province increased tenfold in 1954 compared to before liberation. A newly built metallurgical plant near this area can obtain thousands of tons of zinc and lead ore every day. Currently, Polish zinc smelters are able to produce zinc ingots with a purity of 99.99 percent. In 1955, Poland's total non-ferrous metal production will be three times more than in 1938.
    Many Industrial Enterprises in Hungary Complete Quarterly Plans Ahead of Schedule
    Many coal mining, metallurgical, and textile industrial enterprises in Hungary have completed their production plans for the first quarter of this year ahead of schedule.
    As of March 23, fifteen coal mines in Hungary had completed their first-quarter production plans. Miners at the No. 6 mine of the Tatabánya coalfield had over-mined 5,200 tons of coal more than the first-quarter plan by March 21. The large rolling mill of the Lenin Metallurgical United Factory completed its first-quarter production task on March 23.
    Albania's Electricity Production Increases Year by Year
    Albania's electricity production increases year by year, and the electricity produced in 1954 has increased to 25 times that of 1938 in terms of per capita calculation.
    Currently, the country's largest Enver Hoxha Hydropower Station is under construction on the Mati River. The electricity generated by this hydropower station after its completion in 1957 will exceed the total national power generation in 1950.
    In addition to this hydropower station, Albania is also building thermal power plants in Stalin City, Valona, and Cërrik.

    在苏联和人民民主国家
    苏联工人展开迎接“五一”节社会主义竞赛
    莫斯科“镰刀与锤子”钢铁工厂迎接“五一”节的竞赛，是和提高劳动生产率、提前完成五年计划的竞赛密切结合着的。这个工厂的四百五十号轧钢机的工人们，在三月份将近二十天当中超计划生产了八百吨钢材，劳动生产率比去年提高了百分之十五。
    各加盟共和国的企业也投入了竞赛活动。明斯克拖拉机工厂全厂职工都参加了竞赛。柴油发动机车间在竞赛开始后的最初几天内，就使劳动生产率比竞赛前提高了百分之十到十五。
    各个重要建设工地也卷入了竞赛热潮。古比雪夫水电站在建筑溢洪道大堤工人的发起下展开了迎接“五一”节竞赛。
    苏联青少年收集废铁支持国家的建设事业
    苏联各地列宁共产主义青年团的组织发动共青团员、青年和少年先锋队员从事收集废铁的工作，以支持国家的建设事业。
    莫斯科市的列宁共产主义青年团员和青年们，在三月二十七日这个星期天参加了收集废铁的工作，总共收集了三千吨废铁。
    莫斯科各工厂、机关和学校共有四万五千个青年参加了这一天的收集废铁的工作。他们在自己的工厂内，在街道和建筑场所，在被人遗忘的角落和未融化的雪堆里收集着废铁和废钢。斯大林汽车工厂的几百个青年工人在一天内就收集了一百六十吨废铁。红色壮士工厂的青年们在自己的工厂和附近的街道上，用半天时间收集了十吨废铁。在古比雪夫区，全苏消费合作社中央联合会、矿山学院等机关和学校的青年，在早上八时就开始工作，他们的工作地段是街道上的院落、地下室等。他们在一天之内也收集到了为数不小的废铁。
    为了接受各处送来的废铁，已经设置了接收处。有一个接收处在一天中就接收了七百吨废铁。这个数目的废铁经过熔炼后可以制造一百多台拖拉机。
    朝鲜一条长五百多公里的新公路线通车
    从今年三月起，全长五百一十七公里的新公路线在朝鲜七个地段（包括海州—瓮津线）通车了。
    在一九五四年，朝鲜公路线的全长比一九五三年增加了三点三七倍，有五个地段的新公路线（包括清津—罗津线）通车，差不多所有的主要公路线都延长了。乘客的数目为一九五三年的十四倍，超过战前水平四倍。
    波兰的有色金属采炼业有了迅速发展
    波兰有色金属开采和冶炼业近年来有了迅速的发展。现在，波兰已经能够大量生产解放以前所不能出产的铜、铝、镍等有色金属。波兰的锌产量已经超过解放前的四倍，成为世界主要产锌国之一。
    波兰的锌矿和铅矿的基地已经进一步发展了。克拉科夫省俄尔库兹—赫尔扎诺夫地区的锌矿和铅矿的开采量，在一九五四年就增加到解放前的十倍。在这个地区附近新建的冶金工厂每天可以得到成千吨的锌和铅矿砂。目前波兰炼锌厂能够炼出纯度达百分之九十九点九九的锌块。一九五五年，波兰的有色金属总产量将比一九三八年多三倍。
    匈牙利许多工业企业提前完成季度计划
    匈牙利有许多采煤、冶金和纺织工业企业提前完成了今年第一季的生产计划。
    截至三月二十三日为止，匈牙利已经有十五个煤矿完成了第一季的生产计划。达塔班涅亚煤场的第六号矿井的矿工，到三月二十一日就超过第一季计划多开采了五千二百吨煤。列宁冶金联合工厂的大型轧钢厂在三月二十三日完成了第一季的生产任务。
    阿尔巴尼亚电力生产一年比一年增加
    阿尔巴尼亚的电力生产一年比一年增加，一九五四年生产的电力按人口平均计算已经增加到一九三八年的二十五倍。
    现在，麦蒂河上正在建设全国最大的恩维尔·霍查水电站。这个水电站在一九五七年建成后所发出的电力，将超过一九五零年全国发电量的总和。
    除了这个水电站外，阿尔巴尼亚还在斯大林城、发罗那和柴立克等地建设火力发电站。
