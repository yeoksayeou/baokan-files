Comrades Representatives! Distinguished Guests!
    The First National Congress of the China Democratic National Construction Association, established for ten years, opens today. Let us first pay the highest tribute to the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong for leading the Chinese people to continuous progress in the revolutionary cause! As everyone knows, any achievement in the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people has been achieved under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. For example, our China Democratic National Construction Association has been able to move forward continuously with the development of the revolutionary situation over the past decade, relying on the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. I would like to take this opportunity to express the unanimous will of the association and all comrades: We must and will always follow the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao forward!
    Our association was established in December 1945, and it has now entered its tenth year. The current number of members has increased more than fortyfold since its establishment. According to the resolution of the plenary meeting of the General Association Committee in November 1953 and the requirements of current work, the convening of this First National Congress is of great historical significance to our association.
    The tasks of our congress are:
    To listen to, discuss, and approve the work report of the General Association Committee;
    To determine the basic principles and tasks of the association's work in the future;
    To revise the constitution;
    To elect new members of the central leading body.
    Under the concern and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and with the active efforts of the representatives, our congress will certainly be able to concentrate its efforts on studying and discussing the major issues such as the principles and tasks of our association in accordance with the requirements of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the General Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and based on the current situation of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce by the state, so as to successfully achieve its own tasks.
    Comrades, let us take a look at the circumstances under which this congress is being held.
    First of all, we should see the current international situation. The national economy and national defense capabilities of various countries in the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union are constantly growing, and the friendly cooperation between these countries is increasingly consolidated and developed, showing the world that it is an invincible and strong fortress, thus giving great encouragement and hope to the people who love peace and democracy in all countries. The struggle of the oppressed people and oppressed nations in the world against aggression and for democracy and independence is expanding. Many countries are increasingly expressing their dissatisfaction with the aggressive war line pursued by the American imperialists, and some are willing to take the path of peaceful consultation. The aggressive group headed by the American imperialists is increasingly feeling that time is against it, and therefore more frantically carrying out aggression, more blatantly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and intensifying preparations for a new war for the benefit of monopoly capital, regardless of the opposition of the people all over the world. The mad actions of war instigators will only strengthen the determination and actions of the people all over the world to defend international peace and security; our Chinese people's powerful response to them is: resolutely and unswervingly carry out the struggle to liberate Taiwan, and strive to the end to safeguard the cause of world peace.
    Secondly, we should see the great achievements of our country in politics, economy, and culture. The convening of the First Session of the National People's Congress and the promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China mark the further unity of the 600 million people and the unanimous will to build the motherland into a great socialist country. The country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture are advancing with a heroic pace, and these achievements are increasingly and significantly changing the face of our national economy. The material and cultural living standards of the people of the whole country are gradually improving. Our country has become a recognized powerful country in the world.
    Furthermore, we should see the achievements and development of the state's work on the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Since the announcement of the general task for the transition period of the state, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce by the state has made greater progress. In the past year or so, the development of state capitalist economy has been very significant, especially the expansion of joint state-private industries and the gradual transformation of commerce by industry and trade, which has achieved key and beneficial experience. In order to adapt to the requirements of the state's general task, our association stipulated a new work policy at the plenary meeting of the General Association Committee in November 1953, which is: to cultivate and improve industrial and commercial members to become the backbone of the industrial and commercial circles, to contact and drive as many capitalist industrialists and businessmen as possible to actively accept socialist transformation. The practice of the past year or so has proved that this work policy is correct, but it should be pointed out that our work is far from meeting the requirements of the state's socialist transformation work. In the future, the state's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce will inevitably have greater development, followed by many new situations and new problems in the transformation process. Therefore, how to make our work well coordinate in terms of quality and quantity has become an important topic at present.
    Based on the above situation, the current tasks and future work policy of our association are very clear. As a democratic party in the people's democratic united front, our association must, of course, take the state's general task in the transition period as its own general task, that is, it must take the state's general task in the transition period as the overall goal of struggle for the organizations at all levels and all members of our association. In this general task, our association also has a special mission in assisting the state to gradually complete the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, that is, our association must cultivate and improve the industrial and commercial members to become the backbone of the national bourgeoisie who accept socialist transformation, and educate and help them to continue their personal transformation. Through the real examples of the backbone members and their active role, we should improve the industrial and commercial circles' understanding of national policies and their enthusiasm for accepting socialist transformation, so that the state can smoothly and gradually complete the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and strive to guide as many bourgeois elements as possible to participate in the glorious ranks of socialist construction.
    In order to better implement and achieve the above principles and tasks, our association should pay full attention to the following aspects in carrying out its work in the future: First, it must, in accordance with the requirements of the state's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, vigorously carry out work on the existing work base, especially since the plenary meeting of the General Association Committee, and strive to improve the quality of work and appropriately develop the organization; Second, it must closely combine with the specific measures of the state's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, so that the work of our association can effectively and timely serve these measures; Third, it must further strengthen the cooperation with the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce in work, further clarify the relationship of division of labor and cooperation between each other, and actively strive for cooperation with other relevant agencies and organizations - especially trade unions; Fourth, it must strengthen the mutual unity of industrial and commercial members and non-industrial and commercial members, and the association should help non-industrial and commercial members understand the role and responsibility of intellectuals in the revolutionary cause through appropriate work, and clarify ideologically that participating in the work of the association is a practice of socialist construction and also a practice of personal ideological transformation, so that they can contribute their strength to the work of the association.
    The task of the association is to rely on the collective efforts of all members to complete it. For this reason, the association requires members, especially industrial and commercial members, to clearly understand and practically achieve the following five points:
    1.  Must consciously and actively abide by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and unswervingly struggle for the full implementation of the Constitution. We must resolutely be loyal to the people's democratic system and the lofty goal of building a prosperous and happy socialist society; we must faithfully fulfill our sacred duties and strive to complete our glorious tasks in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution; we must set an example in loving the country, abiding by the law, accepting socialist transformation, obeying the management of state administrative organs, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the workers, and lead private industrialists and businessmen to actively support and abide by the Constitution.
    2.  Must continue to carry forward the spirit of patriotism, oppose the criminal acts of American imperialism colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group to occupy our territory Taiwan and carry out war provocations, raise vigilance, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, have the confidence and determination to overcome all difficulties under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, complete the tasks assigned by the state, and unite private industrialists and businessmen to jointly adhere to the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies, and contribute all our strength to liberating Taiwan, defending the security of the motherland, and world peace.
    3.  Must actively support and fully support the implementation of the state's First Five-Year Plan. We must set an example and promote the industrial and commercial circles to obey the state's economic plan, obey the government's unified arrangement for private industry and commerce, actively put our related enterprises on the track of state capitalism and the track of state planning, and strive to complete the production and operation tasks assigned by the state.
    4.  Must consciously and actively accept socialist transformation, conscientiously complete tasks, strive to create conditions, and continue to promote enterprises to advance on the road of socialist transformation; must combine enterprise transformation and carry out ideological transformation under the leadership and education of socialist components; must lead capitalist industrialists and businessmen to move forward together with their own enhanced awareness, that is, strive to accept socialist ideology and collectivist spirit, actively improve enterprise production and operation, and patriotic actions, so as to increase assistance and reduce resistance to the country's socialist transformation.
    5.  Must closely contact the masses of the industrial and commercial circles, and through their own exemplary behavior and propaganda and education work, help them actively abide by the country's policies and laws, and at the same time, more deeply understand the situation and opinions of capitalist industrialists and businessmen, fully reflect their opinions and demands, conscientiously represent their legitimate interests, help deal with their difficulties and problems as much as possible, and seriously criticize and struggle against all illegal acts and erroneous ideas.
    Comrades, why does the association put forward these five requirements to members, especially industrial and commercial members, based on the principles and tasks of future work?
    What is the current situation of capitalist industrialists and businessmen accepting socialist transformation? That is: Under the encouragement and guidance of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, some advanced elements in the industrial and commercial circles have actively accepted socialist transformation to varying degrees, thus playing a leading and promoting role. This advanced element is gradually increasing, which is a good phenomenon; however, a considerable number of capitalist industrialists and businessmen still adopt a negative and passive attitude towards accepting socialist transformation to this day, and even a few people still have acts of resistance and sabotage. At the same time, some backbone members have a tendency to become detached from the masses, do not pay attention to the situation of other industrialists and businessmen accepting socialist transformation, and do not care about their opinions and demands, which is manifested in that on the one hand, they do not dare to represent their legitimate interests and reasonable demands, and do not actively help them with their problems and difficulties, and on the other hand, they do not seriously criticize and struggle against their erroneous ideas and illegal behaviors.
    We must recognize that the state's gradual realization of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is to gradually replace capitalist ownership with public ownership through the road of peaceful transition. Undoubtedly, this road is in line with the fundamental and long-term interests of the working class, and therefore also in line with the interests of the people of the whole country, and also in line with the interests of Chinese capitalist industrialists and businessmen. Capitalist industrialists and businessmen should also regard this as their greatest interest, because through such a road, they can gradually become workers in socialist society through enterprise transformation and personal transformation. To achieve such a change, the key for capitalist industrialists and businessmen lies in striving to improve their awareness, recognizing the great significance of the state's general task in the transition period, trusting the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and working hard to practice accepting socialist transformation as their glorious task. It should also be recognized that since capitalist industry and commerce in the past developed on the basis of the semi-colonial old China, and after the liberation of the whole country, there was also a certain blind development, and some of them increasingly clearly exposed the problems of being unsuitable for the needs of the people and contradicting the state plan to varying degrees. Therefore, the state's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce cannot be left untouched, but must be gradually carried out according to the state's plan. Capitalist industrialists and businessmen should correct their attitude towards socialist transformation based on these understandings, and truly consciously and actively accept transformation, work hard, complete tasks, create conditions, and overcome difficulties. The ability of capitalist industrialists and businessmen to do this is a concrete manifestation of loving the motherland, loyally accepting the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and actively participating in socialist construction.
    We should also recognize that the preciousness of backbone members lies not only in personal progress, but more importantly in their ability to influence and even lead most capitalist industrialists and businessmen to move forward together with their understanding of accepting socialist transformation and their leading and exemplary behaviors. Therefore, as a backbone member of the industrial and commercial circles, the primary condition is that he must actively accept socialist transformation, actively manage his own enterprise well, and closely contact the masses of the industrial and commercial circles, otherwise he cannot play a role. If a backbone member, because he has a certain understanding of the exploiting essence of capitalism and a certain confidence in the future of socialism, wants to immediately change his class composition, does not actively manage the enterprise well, and shows the above-mentioned tendency to become detached from the masses, this is essentially canceling the role that backbone members should play in socialist transformation, and is not in line with the state's requirements for backbone members. As for some people who encounter some difficulties in enterprise management and try to "throw away the burden," can they still be called a backbone member? Therefore, backbone members of the industrial and commercial circles, especially members of our association, should recognize that their responsibility is to strive to improve themselves, actively accept socialist transformation, actively manage enterprises well, closely contact the masses of the industrial and commercial circles, and give full play to the active role of backbone members. Only in this way can they truly shoulder the tasks given by the state, do good things for the people, and benefit both the country's socialist construction and personal ideological transformation and work prospects. On September 7, 1952, at the Fourth Membership Congress of the Beijing Branch, I once said something based on Chairman Mao's instructions, the general idea is: Under Chinese conditions, those few far-sighted people among the bourgeoisie may accept the basic ideas of the working class, that is, socialist ideas, and therefore become interested in the cause of socialism. They open factories on the one hand and do not require to change their composition and career immediately; on the other hand, they see the great contribution of the socialist cause to mankind and want to be a socialist in the future. Such people are possible, and we should welcome them. This passage is still necessary for comrades to pay attention to and deeply understand again today.
    Comrades, the Constitution of the People's Republic of China affirms the state's general task in the transition period and the common aspirations of the broad masses of the people to build a socialist society in the form of law. Since then, taking the socialist road has become the legal goal of our country, and this goal has become a huge driving force that inspires and attracts the people of the whole country to move forward. In order to achieve this great goal, our country is carrying out vigorous construction, and the people of the whole country are contributing their labor and wisdom with high enthusiasm. Members of our association and the capitalist industrialists and businessmen they contact should not lag behind this situation. We must clearly recognize that the state's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is a part of the country's socialist construction, and there should not be any negative or passive mentality; we must clearly recognize that doing a good job as a backbone member is a contribution to the country's socialist construction, and there should not be any concerns or wavering mentality. Comrades, the Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates our political status and points out the road for us to transition to socialist society. The Chinese People's Democratic United Front, led by the Chinese Communist Party, in which we participate is becoming more and more consolidated and expanded. After our enterprises are incorporated into the track of state capitalism, they become part of the state plan. In the process of class elimination, we are gradually transforming ourselves, so that we can play an active and beneficial role in the process of socialist transformation, and be able to shoulder appropriate work in the future socialist society. Comrades, as long as we resolutely follow the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and constantly work hard, our future is bright.
    Comrades, the preamble of the Constitution points out: "In the future, in mobilizing and uniting the people of the whole country to complete the state's general task in the transition period and the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies, our country's people's democratic united front will continue to play its role." Our association is a democratic party in the Chinese People's Democratic United Front, and our responsibility is significant. Our association must advance with the progress of society, and its tasks must also develop with the development of the situation. In the process of enterprise transformation, individuals will be transformed to a certain extent, but the bourgeois ideology that has been formed for a long time on the basis of capitalist ownership will still exist even after the enterprise has realized socialist transformation, and it still needs to be transformed. This shows that as long as our association does not stagnate, engaging in the transformation work of national bourgeois elements under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party will be a major task for our association for a long period of time.
    Comrades, let us strengthen unity, work hard, and struggle under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party to further assist the state in carrying out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and adhere to the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies!

    在中国民主建国会第一次全国代表大会上的开幕词
    黄炎培代表们！来宾们！同志们！
    中国民主建国会成立十年来的第一次全国代表大会今天开幕了。让我们首先对领导中国人民在革命事业中不断前进的中国共产党和伟大的领袖毛泽东主席致最崇高的敬礼！大家都很明白，中国人民革命事业中的任何成就，都是在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下得来的，即如我们中国民主建国会，十年来所以能够随着革命形势的发展而不断前进，也就是依靠着中国共产党和毛主席的领导。我要借这个机会表达我会和全体同志一致的意志：我们一定要而且一定能够永远跟着中国共产党和毛主席前进！
    我会是在一九四五年十二月成立的，从成立到现在，已经进入第十个年头了。现在的会员人数比成立时已经增加了四十余倍。根据一九五三年十一月总会委员会全体会议的决议以及当前工作的要求，我会召开这第一次全国代表大会，对我会讲来，是有重大的历史意义的。
    我们这次大会的任务是：
    听取、讨论和批准总会委员会的工作报告；
    决定今后本会工作的基本方针、任务；
    修改会章；
    选举新的中央领导机关组成人员。
    在中国共产党的关切和领导下，在代表们的积极努力下，我们这次大会一定能够根据中华人民共和国宪法和中国人民政治协商会议章程总纲的要求，并从国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的当前情况出发，集中力量，研究、讨论我会的方针、任务等重大问题，从而胜利地达成自己的任务。
    同志们，让我们看一看这次大会是在怎样的情况下举行的。
    首先应当看到当前的国际形势。以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营内各个国家的国民经济和国防力量在不断增长，这些国家间的友好合作在日益巩固和发展，向全世界显示出是不可战胜的坚强堡垒，从而给一切国家中爱好和平、民主的人民以莫大的鼓舞和希望。世界上被压迫的人民和被压迫的民族的反对侵略、争取民主、独立的斗争在日益扩大。有许多国家愈来愈表露出对于美国帝国主义者所执行的侵略战争路线的不满，有的愿意走和平协商的道路。以美国帝国主义者为首的侵略集团，则愈来愈感到时间对它的不利，因而更加疯狂地肆行侵略，更加露骨地干涉别国的内政，并且不顾全世界人民的反对，为了垄断资本的利益，加紧准备新的战争。战争挑拨者的疯狂行为只会增强全世界人民保卫国际和平与安全的决心和行动；我们中国人民给予他们的有力回答是：坚决不渝地进行解放台湾的斗争，并为维护世界和平事业而奋斗到底。
    其次，应当看到我们国家政治上、经济上、文化上的伟大成就。全国人民代表大会第一次会议的召开和中华人民共和国宪法的公布，标志着六万万人民的进一步的团结以及把祖国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家的一致意志。国家的社会主义工业化事业与对农业的社会主义改造事业正以雄迈的步伐向前进展，这种成就正日益显著地在改变我国国民经济的面貌。全国人民的物质的与文化的生活水平正在逐步提高。我们国家已成为公认的世界上的一个强大的国家。
    还有，我们应当看到国家对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造工作的成就和发展。自从国家过渡时期的总任务宣布后，国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，有了更大的进展，一年多来，国家资本主义经济的发展是很显著的，特别是公私合营工业的扩展，商业方面的逐行逐业改造，取得了重点的有益的经验。为了适应国家总任务的要求，我会在一九五三年十一月总会委员会全体会议上规定了新的工作方针，就是：培养、提高工商业者会员成为工商界的骨干分子，联系并带动尽可能多的资本主义工商业者积极接受社会主义改造。一年多来的实践证明，这一工作方针是正确的，但应当指出，我们的工作还远不能适应国家的社会主义改造工作的要求。今后国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造必将有更大的发展，随之而来的将是在改造过程中的许多新的情况和新的问题，因此，如何使我们的工作在质和量等方面能够很好地配合，这已经成为当前的重要的议题了。
    根据上述情况，我会当前的任务和今后的工作方针是很明确的。作为人民民主统一战线中的一个民主党派，我会当然要和全国人民一道以国家在过渡时期的总任务为自己的总任务，也就是，一定要以国家在过渡时期的总任务为我会的各级组织和全体会员总的奋斗目标。在这个总任务中，我会在协助国家逐步完成对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造这一方面，还负有特殊的使命，这就是，我会要把工商业者会员培养、提高成为民族资产阶级中接受社会主义改造的骨干分子，并教育、帮助他们继续进行个人改造，通过骨干分子的真人实例和他们的积极作用，提高工商界对于国家政策的认识和接受社会主义改造的积极性，以便国家顺利地逐步完成对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，争取、引导尽可能多的资产阶级分子参加到社会主义建设的光荣行列中来。
    为了很好地贯彻实现上述方针、任务，我会今后在进行工作时，应当充分注意下列几个方面：第一，必须根据国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的要求，在已有的、尤其是总会委员会全体会议以来的工作基础之上，放手地开展工作，努力提高工作的质量，并适当地发展组织；第二，必须密切结合国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的具体措施，使我会的工作能有效地、及时地为这些措施服务；第三，必须进一步加强与工商业联合会在工作上的配合，进一步明确彼此间分工合作的关系，对其他有关机关和团体——特别是工会，也须积极争取配合；第四，必须加强工商业者会员与非工商业者会员的互相团结，会应通过适当的工作帮助非工商业者会员认识知识分子在革命事业中的作用和责任，在思想上明确参加会的工作就是对社会主义建设的实践，同时也是个人思想改造的实践，从而使他们更能在会的工作中贡献他们的力量。
    会的任务是要依靠全体会员的集体努力来完成的，为此，会要求会员尤其是工商业者会员明确认识和切实做到下列的五项：
    一、必须自觉地、积极地遵守中华人民共和国宪法，坚持不渝地为宪法的全部实施而奋斗。要坚决效忠于人民民主制度和建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会的崇高目的；要依照宪法的规定，忠诚履行我们的神圣职责，努力完成我们的光荣任务；要在爱国守法、接受社会主义改造、服从国家行政机关的管理、国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督等方面，作出榜样，带动私营工商业者积极拥护并遵守宪法。
    二、必须继续发扬爱国主义精神，反对美国帝国主义勾结蒋介石卖国集团侵占我国领土台湾并进行战争挑衅的罪恶行为，提高警惕，分清敌我，有信心和决心在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下克服一切困难，完成国家交给的任务，并团结私营工商业者共同坚持反对国内外敌人的斗争，为解放台湾、保卫祖国安全和世界和平而贡献出一切力量。
    三、必须积极拥护和全力支援国家第一个五年计划的实施。要以身作则并推动工商界服从国家的经济计划，服从政府对于私营工商业的统一安排，积极地把自己有关的企业推上国家资本主义的轨道和国家计划的轨道，并努力完成国家交给的生产和经营的任务。
    四、必须自觉地、积极地接受社会主义改造，认真完成任务，努力创造条件，继续推动企业在社会主义改造的道路上前进；要结合企业改造，在社会主义成分的领导和教育下，来进行思想改造；要以自己觉悟的提高即努力接受社会主义思想和集体主义精神、对于企业生产经营的积极改进和爱国的行动，带动资本主义工商业者一道前进，为国家的社会主义改造事业增加助力，减少阻力。
    五、必须密切联系工商界群众，通过自己的模范行为和宣传教育工作，帮助他们积极遵守国家的政策法令，同时更深入地了解资本主义工商业者的情况和意见，充分地反映他们的意见和要求，认真地代表他们的合法利益，尽可能地帮助处理他们的困难和问题，并严肃地对一切非法行为和错误思想进行批判和斗争。
    同志们，为什么会要根据今后工作的方针、任务，向会员尤其是工商业者会员提出这五项要求呢？
    当前资本主义工商业者接受社会主义改造的情况是怎样呢？那就是：在中国共产党和人民政府的鼓励和指导下，在工商界中有一部分先进分子在不同程度上积极接受社会主义改造，从而起了一种带头、推动的作用，这种先进分子正在逐渐增多，这是好现象；但是，也有为数不少的一部分资本主义工商业者到今天对接受社会主义改造还采取消极、被动的态度，甚至少数人还有抗拒、破坏的行为，同时也有一部分骨干分子有脱离群众的倾向，不注意其他工商业者接受社会主义改造的情况，不关心他们的意见和要求，表现为一方面不敢代表他们的合法利益和合理要求，不对他们的问题和困难进行积极的帮助，另一方面又对他们的错误思想和违法行为不进行严肃的批判和斗争。
    我们必须认识：国家对资本主义工商业逐步实现社会主义改造，就是通过和平过渡的道路逐步以全民所有制代替资本家所有制。无疑地，这条道路是符合工人阶级的根本利益和长远利益，因而也符合全国人民的利益的，同时也是符合中国资本主义工商业者的利益的。资本主义工商业者还应当把这看作自己的最大利益，因为通过这样的道路，可以经过企业改造与个人改造，逐步使自己成为社会主义社会的工作者。而要实现这样的一种改变，在资本主义工商业者方面，其关键是在于要努力提高自己的觉悟，认识国家过渡时期总任务的重大意义，信任中国共产党和毛主席的领导，把接受社会主义改造看作自己的光荣任务而努力去实践。还应认识：由于资本主义工商业过去是在旧中国半殖民地的基础上发展起来的，全国解放以后，也有一定的盲目发展，有一部分愈来愈明显地暴露出在不同程度上不适合人民的需要、与国家计划相抵触的毛病。因此，国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，决不可能原封不动，而要根据国家的计划逐步进行。资本主义工商业者应当根据这些认识，端正对社会主义改造的态度，真正做到自觉地、积极地接受改造，努力工作，完成任务，创造条件，克服困难。资本主义工商业者能这样做，就是热爱祖国、忠诚接受中国共产党和人民政府的领导、积极参加社会主义建设的具体表现。
    我们还应该认识：骨干分子的可贵，不仅在于个人的进步，更主要地在于他们能以自己对于接受社会主义改造的认识和带头的、模范的行为来影响以至带动大多数资本主义工商业者一同前进。因此，作为一个工商界的骨干分子，其首要条件就是必须积极接受社会主义改造，积极搞好自己的企业，密切联系工商界群众，否则就不能发生作用。假若一个骨干分子由于自己对资本主义的剥削本质有了一定的认识，对于社会主义的前途有了一定的信心，因而就想立即变更自己的阶级成分，不积极搞好企业，表现为上述那种脱离群众的倾向，这实质上就是取消了骨干分子在社会主义改造中应起的作用，是不符合国家对骨干分子的要求的。至于有些人因为企业经营中遭遇到若干困难，就企图“丢掉包袱”，那还称得上一个骨干分子吗？所以，工商界骨干分子，尤其是我会会员应该认识自己的责任是努力提高自己，积极接受社会主义改造，积极搞好企业，密切联系工商界群众，充分发挥骨干分子的积极作用。只有这样，才是真正担负起国家所给予的任务，才是为人民做了好事，才是既有利于国家的社会主义建设，也有利于个人的思想改造和工作前途。一九五二年九月七日在北京市分会第四届会员大会上，我曾经根据毛主席的指示讲过这样一段话，大意是：在中国的条件下，资产阶级中间那些少数有远见的人们，可能接受工人阶级的基本思想即社会主义思想，因而对社会主义事业发生兴趣，他们一面开工厂，并不要求马上变更自己的成分和事业；一面看到社会主义事业对于人类的伟大贡献，想在将来做一个社会主义者。这种人是可能有的，我们对他们应该表示欢迎。这段话，今天仍然有再度提请同志们注意和深刻体会的必要。
    同志们，中华人民共和国宪法把国家过渡时期总任务和广大人民建设社会主义社会的共同愿望用法律的形式肯定下来。从此，走社会主义道路成为我们国家的法定目标，这个目标已成为鼓舞、吸引全国人民奋发前进的巨大动力。为了实现这个伟大的目标，我们国家正在进行蓬蓬勃勃的建设，全国人民正以高度的热情贡献出自己的劳动与智慧。我会会员和所联系的资本主义工商业者不应当落在这个形势的后面，我们必须明确认识国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造就是国家的社会主义建设的一部分，不应当有任何消极、被动的心理；我们必须明确认识做好骨干分子的工作，就是对国家的社会主义建设有所贡献，不应当有任何顾虑、动摇的心理。同志们，中华人民共和国宪法中规定了我们的政治地位，并指出我们如何过渡到社会主义社会的道路。我们参加的以中国共产党为领导的中国人民民主统一战线愈益巩固和扩大。我们的企业纳入国家资本主义轨道后，就成为国家计划的一部分。我们在阶级消灭的过程中，正在把自己逐步改造，使自己在社会主义改造过程中能起积极的有益的作用，在将来的社会主义社会中能够担负适当的工作。同志们，只要我们坚决地跟着中国共产党和毛主席走，并不断地努力，我们的前途是光明的。
    同志们，宪法的序言中指出：“今后在动员和团结全国人民完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对内外敌人的斗争中，我国的人民民主统一战线将继续发挥它的作用。”我会是中国人民民主统一战线中的一个民主党派，我们的责任是重大的。我会要随着社会的前进而前进，任务也要随着形势的发展而发展。在企业改造的过程中，个人是会得到一定的改造的，但是在资本家所有制的基础上长期形成的资产阶级思想，即使企业已经实现社会主义改造，还是会存在的，还是需要改造的。这就说明，我会只要不是停滞不前，在中国共产党的领导下从事关于民族资产阶级分子的改造工作，将是我会长时期的重大任务。
    同志们，让我们大家加强团结，努力工作，在中国共产党的领导下，为进一步协助国家对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造，坚持对国内外敌人的斗争而奋斗吧！　（新华社）
