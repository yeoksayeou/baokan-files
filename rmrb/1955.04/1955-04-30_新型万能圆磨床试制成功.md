    New Universal Cylindrical Grinder Successfully Trial-Produced
      On the eve of "May Day", a Soviet-style 3Г12М universal cylindrical grinder was successfully trial-produced at the state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Plant.

    More than 40 of these versatile precision grinders have already been ordered by more than 20 well-known factories and technical schools, including Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant.

    Since successfully trial-producing the first Soviet-style 373 surface grinder in December 1953, the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant has now successfully trial-produced ten Soviet models of precision grinders, two of which are the latest grinders exhibited at the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition.

    The factory's various products have participated in exhibitions held in ten countries in Europe and Asia.

    新型万能圆磨床试制成功
      “五一”节前夕，一种苏式三Г一二М型万能圆磨床在国营上海机床厂试制成功了。
    这种用途广泛的精密磨床，已经被哈尔滨量具刃具厂等二十多个著名的工厂和技术学校订购去四十多台。
    上海机床厂在一九五三年十二月试制成功第一种苏式三七三型平面磨床后，到现在已经试制成功了十种苏联型号的精密磨床，其中有两种是苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会展出的最新式的磨床。
    这个厂的各种产品曾经参加过在欧洲和亚洲的十个国家举办的展览会。
