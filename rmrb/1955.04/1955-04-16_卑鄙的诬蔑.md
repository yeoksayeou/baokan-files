The eleven staff members of the Chinese delegation and Chinese and foreign journalists who were traveling on the Indian plane to attend the Asian-African Conference were all unfortunately killed due to the premeditated sabotage of the plane by US-Chiang Kai-shek agents in Hong Kong. Upon hearing the news, the Chinese people were deeply grieved. We feel extremely indignant at this vile crime committed by the US aggressive bloc and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

At this moment, the US aggressive bloc is using increasingly despicable and shameless means to deny its crime of colluding with Chiang Kai-shek agents to murder the staff members of the Chinese delegation and Chinese and foreign journalists.

After the Chinese government pointed out that the Indian plane crash was the result of sabotage by US-Chiang Kai-shek agents, the US State Department immediately asserted that the Chinese government's accusation was "without any basis." The US propaganda machine then tried its best to make people believe that the plane crash was not due to sabotage by agents but due to "mechanical failure." However, if the US had nothing to do with this murder, why would the US not even want to consider the possibility of agents sabotaging the plane, and instead try its best to publicize that the crash was due to "mechanical failure"? The US's attempt to evade the possibility of sabotage by agents precisely exposes that it is an accomplice in this murder.

Now, it is becoming increasingly difficult to deceive people by insisting that the plane crash was due to mechanical failure. Therefore, the US aggressive bloc has resorted to even more despicable and shameless means, attempting to deny its crimes by slandering the Chinese people and the murdered staff members of the Chinese delegation.

This slander is being carried out through the United Press International. In a dispatch from Singapore on the 14th, UPI viciously and repeatedly slandered the Chinese personnel murdered by US-Chiang Kai-shek agents as so-called "rebellious party members," attempting to prove that the plane was sabotaged by China itself in order to "eliminate" them. The US is widely spreading this slander. News has it that even the British authorities in Hong Kong have already begun so-called investigations based on this absurd argument.

The US's dissemination of this absurd argument was prepared in advance. After the plane crash, an Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 12th reported the same argument made by a US official. The US aggressive bloc apparently thought that in case the lie about mechanical failure could not deceive people, it could use this most absurd slander to confuse the public, obscure the truth, and escape its responsibility.

However, this slander by the US aggressive bloc cannot deny its crimes. On the contrary, the fact that the US aggressive bloc has carried out such slander against the excellent sons and daughters of the Chinese people who were murdered for the solemn cause of friendly cooperation and independence and freedom of the people of Asia and Africa, and against the Chinese people who are mourning the loss of their loved ones, completely proves that it has lost all conscience and humanity. And this is precisely the characteristic of a murderer.

The Chinese people will forever remember this murder committed by the US aggressive bloc and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. From this event, the Chinese people have more clearly realized that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique under US protection is a serious threat to the security of the motherland and the peace of Asia. The Chinese people must unite as one and intensify their efforts to liberate Taiwan, eliminate the US running dog Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and resolutely fight to realize the unfulfilled wishes of the fallen martyrs to defend the independence of the motherland and defend the peace of Asia.

    卑鄙的诬蔑
    胡今
    乘坐印度飞机出席亚非会议的中国代表团工作人员和中外记者十一人，由于香港美蒋特务对飞机的预谋破坏，不幸全部遇难。消息传来，中国人民悲痛万分。我们对于美国侵略集团和蒋介石卖国集团这种卑劣罪行感到极端愤慨。
    正在这时候，美国侵略集团却在用越来越卑鄙无耻的手段，抵赖它勾结蒋介石特务谋杀中国代表团工作人员和中外记者的罪行。
    在中国政府指出印度飞机失事是美蒋特务破坏的结果以后，美国国务院立刻一口咬定说中国政府的指责是“没有丝毫根据的”。美国宣传机器紧跟着竭力企图使人相信飞机失事不是由于特务破坏而是由于“机件故障”。但是，如果美国和这一谋杀事件无关，为什么美国甚至不愿意稍为考虑一下特务破坏飞机的可能性，而竭力宣扬是由于“机件故障”而失事的呢？美国这样竭力躲闪特务破坏的可能，恰恰暴露了它正是这一谋杀行为的同谋者。
    现在，硬说飞机失事是由于机件故障的说法越来越不容易骗人了。因此，美国侵略集团就使出了更加卑鄙无耻的手段，企图用诬蔑中国人民和被谋杀了的中国代表团工作人员来抵赖自己的罪行。
    这种诬蔑是假美国合众社之口进行的。合众社在十四日从新加坡发出的电讯中，极端恶毒地一再诬蔑被美蒋特务谋害的中国人员是所谓“背叛的党员”，企图借此证明飞机是中国为了“清除”他们而自己破坏的。美国正在把这种诬蔑广泛散布。有消息说，甚至香港英国当局也已经在按照这种荒谬的论调进行所谓调查。
    美国散布这种荒谬论调是早有准备的。在飞机失事以后，美联社华盛顿十二日电就报道了一名美国官员所发表的同样的论调。美国侵略集团显然以为，万一机件故障的鬼话骗不了人，它就可以用这种最荒谬的诬蔑来混乱视听，模糊真相，以便逃避它的罪责。
    但是，美国侵略集团这种诬蔑，决不能抵赖掉它的罪行。相反，对于为了亚非两洲人民的友好合作和独立自由的庄严事业而被谋杀了的中国人民的优秀儿子们，对于因为丧失了自己的亲人而沉痛悼念的中国人民，美国侵略集团竟进行这样的诬蔑，这完全证明了它已经是丧尽天良、灭绝人性。而这正是杀人犯的特点。
    中国人民将要永远记住美国侵略集团和蒋介石卖国集团的这一谋杀罪行。中国人民从这个事件中更加清楚地认识到，美国庇护下的蒋介石卖国集团是祖国安全和亚洲和平的严重威胁。中国人民一定要万众一心地加紧为解放台湾、消灭美国走狗蒋介石卖国集团，为实现死难烈士们的保卫祖国独立、保卫亚洲和平的遗志而坚决斗争。
