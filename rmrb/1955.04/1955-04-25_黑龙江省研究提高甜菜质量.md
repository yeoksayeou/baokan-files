Following the publication of the article "Changing the Situation of Declining Sugar Beet Quality" on page two of this newspaper on March 17th, which criticized the serious situation in Heilongjiang Province last year where the low quality of sugar beets and the decline in sugar content resulted in a reduction of more than 10 million yuan in state revenue, the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Industry and the Department of Agriculture convened a sugar beet production meeting at the end of March. The meeting was attended by full-time sugar beet cadres from sugar beet planting counties, heads of agricultural affairs sections of various sugar factories, and heads of sugar beet management stations. The meeting focused on studying ways to improve sugar beet quality. The meeting believed that actively and steadily promoting new-style animal-powered farm tools, reforming cultivation methods, and expanding the area of fertilization, especially the use of chemical fertilizers such as superphosphate and ammonium sulfate, would have a significant effect on improving the sugar content of sugar beets. The meeting decided that sugar beet producing areas should gradually adopt these methods to improve the quality and yield of sugar beets. This year, the sugar beet planting area in Heilongjiang Province reached a total of 80,000 hectares. (Our correspondent in Harbin)

    黑龙江省研究提高甜菜质量
    三月十七日本报二版刊载“改变甜菜质量下降的情况”一文，批评了黑龙江省去年因甜菜质量低劣，含糖率下降而使国家减少了收入一千多万元的严重情况后，黑龙江省工业厅和农业厅即于三月底召开了有种植甜菜县的甜菜专职干部，各糖厂的农务科长、甜菜管理站长参加的甜菜生产会议。会议着重研究了改进甜菜质量的办法。会议认为：积极稳步推广新式畜力农具，改革耕作方法，扩大施肥面积，特别是使用化学肥料过磷酸石灰和硫铵，这对提高甜菜的含糖率有重大作用。会议决定：各甜菜产区应逐步采用这些办法来提高甜菜的质量和产量。今年黑龙江省甜菜播种面积共达到八万公顷。　（本报驻哈尔滨记者）
