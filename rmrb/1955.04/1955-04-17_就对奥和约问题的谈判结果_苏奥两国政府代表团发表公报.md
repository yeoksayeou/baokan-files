Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th. TASS, Moscow, 15th. From April 12 to 15, 1955, an Austrian government delegation headed by Federal Chancellor Julius Raab and Vice Chancellor Dr. Adolf Schärf held negotiations in Moscow with a Soviet government delegation headed by Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs V.M. Molotov and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers A.I. Mikoyan. The negotiations were conducted in a friendly spirit.

As a result of the negotiations, both sides declared that both the Soviet government and the government of the Republic of Austria believe that a state treaty on the restoration of Austria's independence and democracy should be concluded as quickly as possible, which would be in line with the national interests of the Austrian people and would be conducive to consolidating peace in Europe.

The Austrian delegation guaranteed that the Republic of Austria, in the spirit of the declaration made at the Berlin Conference in 1954, does not intend to join any military alliances and will not allow the establishment of military bases on its territory. Austria will pursue an independent policy in its dealings with all countries to ensure compliance with the above declaration.

The Soviet side agreed that after the entry into force of the Austrian State Treaty, the troops of the four countries should withdraw from Austria no later than December 31, 1955. In view of the statement issued by the governments of the United States, France and the United Kingdom on April 5 this year expressing their willingness to conclude the Austrian State Treaty as quickly as possible, the Soviet and Austrian delegations expressed the hope that the four countries and Austria currently have a good opportunity to reach a corresponding agreement to resolve the Austrian issue.

The Soviet government also agreed, in the spirit of its declaration at the Berlin Conference in 1954, that the Austrian side should fully compensate the 150 million U.S. dollars in reparations stipulated in Article 35 of the treaty with goods.

The Soviet government announced that, in addition to preparing to hand over German property in the Soviet occupation zone to Austria in accordance with the original regulations, the Soviet side is also prepared to immediately hand over the property of the Danube Shipping Company, including the shipyard in Korneuburg, all ships and port facilities, to Austria after the treaty comes into effect, and the Austrian side will pay an appropriate price. The Soviet government also agreed to make further concessions to Austria, waiving the ownership of oil fields and refineries, including the Oil Products Trading Joint-Stock Company, stipulated in Article 35 of the treaty, and Austria will supply crude oil to the Soviet Union in quantities agreed upon by both parties.

In addition, the two sides reached an agreement to hold negotiations in the near future to discuss the normalization of trade relations between Austria and the Soviet Union.

The Soviet delegation informed the Austrian delegation that the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has promised to consider the request of Austrian Federal President Körner to sympathetically consider the issue of releasing Austrian citizens sentenced to imprisonment by Soviet judicial organs to return to their country. After the withdrawal of the Soviet occupation forces from Austria, there will be no more prisoners of war or detained Austrian civilians left in the Soviet Union.

    就对奥和约问题的谈判结果
    苏奥两国政府代表团发表公报
    新华社十六日讯　塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：一九五五年四月十二日至十五日，以联邦总理尤利乌斯·拉布和副总理阿道夫·谢尔夫博士为首的奥地利政府代表团同以部长会议副主席兼外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫和部长会议副主席阿·伊·米高扬为首的苏联政府代表团在莫斯科举行了谈判，谈判是本着友好的精神进行的。
    谈判结果，双方声明：无论苏联政府或是奥地利共和国政府都认为，应该最迅速地缔结关于恢复奥地利的独立和民主的和约，这将会符合于奥地利人民的民族利益，并且有利于巩固欧洲和平。
    奥地利代表团保证：奥地利共和国按照一九五四年在柏林会议上所作的声明的精神，不准备参加任何军事联盟，也不准备容许在自己的领土上建立军事基地。奥地利将在同一切国家的交往中执行独立的政策，以保证遵守上述宣言。
    苏联方面同意在对奥和约生效以后，四国军队最迟应在一九五五年十二月三十一日撤出奥地利。鉴于美国、法国和英国政府在今年四月五日发表声明，表示愿意最迅速地缔结对奥和约，苏联和奥地利代表团表示希望，四国和奥地利目前有良好的机会达成相应的协议，以解决奥地利问题。
    苏联政府并且按照它一九五四年在柏林会议上所作的声明的精神，同意奥地利方面完全用货物来偿付和约第三十五条所规定的一亿五千万美元的赔款。
    苏联政府宣布：苏联方面除了按照原来的规定准备把苏联占领区内的德国财产交给奥地利以外，在和约生效之后，还准备立刻把多瑙河航运公司的财产，包括在柯奈堡的船坞、全部船只和港口设备，移交给奥地利，而由奥地利方面偿付适当的价款。苏联政府并且同意向奥地利作进一步的让步，放弃和约第三十五条所规定的对油田和炼油厂，包括石油产品贸易股份公司的所有权，而由奥地利按照双方所同意的数量把原油供给苏联。
    此外，双方并取得协议，准备在最近举行谈判，商讨使奥地利和苏联两国之间的贸易关系正常化的问题。
    苏联代表团通知奥地利代表团说：苏联最高苏维埃主席团已经答应考虑奥地利联邦总统柯尔纳博士的要求，将同情地考虑释放被苏联司法机关判处徒刑的奥地利人回国的问题。在苏联占领军撤出奥地利之后，苏联境内将不再留下一个战俘或是一个被扣留的奥地利平民。
