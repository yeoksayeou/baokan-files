To the Editor:

In the past year, the "five excesses" phenomenon in rural work in Xinchang County, Zhejiang Province, has shown a tendency to resurface. First, it is manifested in the excessive number of meetings at various levels. After the branch secretary accepts a task, he convenes a branch committee meeting – a branch general meeting – a people's representative meeting or a mutual aid and cooperation representative meeting – a village key backbone meeting – a mass meeting – and group discussions in the cooperative, etc. Party members have to participate in these meetings from beginning to end, which takes up a lot of time. For example, Ding Futang of Xinmin Township only produced for two and a half days in the twenty-nine days after the Spring Festival. Chen Xianchang of Wangjiangshan Village in the same township spent forty-six days in meetings out of ninety-six days. Shi Dehua of Shixi Township spent eighteen days in county and township meetings in January, only worked for two days in February, and spent seven days digging tobacco fields in March, with the rest of the time spent in meetings.

Secondly, the situation of party members holding multiple positions still exists. Generally, party members hold several positions simultaneously. For example, Chen Xianchang, a party member in Xinmin Township, holds thirteen positions. Shi Dehua of Shixi Township holds positions such as the branch organization member in the Party, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, a member of the agricultural production cooperative committee, the director of the township credit cooperative, the township militia instructor, etc., and he is indispensable for every political task. Therefore, things always fall on a few key backbones, making them busy day and night and very tired. Yu Xiangqian, a party member in Fenshui Township, also serves as the village chief, the director of the agricultural production cooperative, a member of the township people's committee, a director and supervisor of the township credit cooperative, and a member of the township culture and education committee.

Due to the excessive number of meetings and the multiple positions held by activists, the activists also lose a lot of work time. Their actual working days are generally about half of those of ordinary cooperative members. For example, Shi Dehua of Shixi Township has earned a total of 120 work points since the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative, while other cooperative members generally have over 200 work points, and those with stronger labor power have over 300 work points. Because rural cadres have too many meetings, too many concurrent jobs, and too much lost work time, production is neglected, family life is difficult, and work enthusiasm will not last long. For example, Yu Xiangqian, a party member in Fenshui Township, is the main labor force in his family. Because he usually loses work time due to meetings and has little income, he now owes more than 200 yuan. His wife scolds him, and he is also very distressed and hopes to leave his hometown to work in Shanghai.

Currently, it is the season of intense spring plowing, and the decisive moment for whether or not production can be increased throughout the year is now. If this "five excesses" phenomenon continues to exist, it will inevitably affect spring plowing production. Therefore, the leaders of Xinchang County must pay attention to leading township work cadres to streamline meetings, reduce concurrent jobs, correct the "five excesses" phenomenon, and ensure the smooth progress of spring plowing production.

### 新昌县乡村工作中仍然有“五多”现象

    新昌县乡村工作中仍然有“五多”现象编辑同志：
    最近一年来，浙江新昌县农村工作中的“五多”现象又有抬头复活的趋势。首先表现在会议层次多，从支部书记接受任务回来后，就召开支委会——支部大会——人民代表会或互助合作代表会——村主要骨干会——群众大会——社组分头讨论等会。这些会，党员从头到尾都要参加，花费时间很多。如新民乡丁福堂，春节以后二十九天中只生产了两个半天。同乡望江山村的陈显昌九十六天中，有四十六个白天在开会。石溪乡石德华，正月份在县、乡开会十八天，二月份只做了两天活，三月份掏了七天烟地，其余时间都花在开会上。
    其次，党员兼职多的情况仍然存在，一般党员都身兼数职。如新民乡党员陈显昌身兼十三职。石溪乡石德华，在党内任支部组织委员，青年团支部书记、农业生产合作社社务委员、乡信用社理事主任、乡民兵指导员………等职，每个政治任务也少不了他参加。分水乡党员俞相千，也担任了村长、农业生产合作社主任、乡人民委员、乡信用合作社理监事、乡文教委员等职。因此有事总找到几个主要骨干身上，使他们日夜忙碌，十分疲劳。
    由于会议多、积极分子的兼职多，因此，积极分子误工也特别多。他们的实际工作日一般都要比社内的普通社员少一半左右。如石溪乡石德华，自农业生产合作社建起来到现在，共做了一百二十多分，而社内其他社员普遍都有二百多分，劳力比较强的有三百多分。由于乡村干部的会议多、兼职多、误工多，弄得生产荒废，家庭生活困难，工作积极性不会保持长久。如分水乡党员俞相千，是家里的主要劳动力，因平时开会误工，收入少，现在欠债二百多元，老婆骂他，他也很苦闷，希望离开家乡到上海去做工。
    目前，正是紧张的春耕季节，一年能否增产的决定性关头就在现在了。如果这种“五多”现象继续存在，必然要影响春耕生产。因此，新昌县的领导上必须注意领导乡工作干部精简会议，减少兼职，纠正“五多”现象，保证春耕生产顺利进行。
