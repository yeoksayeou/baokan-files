Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 15th: According to TASS, New York, April 14th: In recent days, American newspapers have been forced to break their conspiratorial silence on the upcoming Asian-African Conference. The news published by American newspapers proves that the conference has caused increasing anxiety among those in the United States who are trying every possible means to obstruct the easing of the international situation and to obstruct negotiations on solving important international issues.

    "New York World-Telegram and Sun" commentator Denning pointed out the reason for Washington's panic, saying that the conference might "damage U.S. prestige in Asia and Africa to a greater extent" and denounced the United States as an imperialist country. He particularly pointed out that most of the representatives of Asian and African countries would not support the U.S. occupation of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands.

    "New York Times" reporter Rosenthal pointed out that Asian and African countries are extraordinarily interested in the conference. He said that Western countries, regardless of the opinions of those countries that aspire to independence or have already achieved independence, "do not recognize the main facts of Asia." The reporter noted with unease that the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have gained prestige in Asian countries, and their participation in the conference will be "not only as equal members, but also as the center of attention."

    Former U.S. Ambassador to India, Bowles, also acknowledged the growing prestige of the People's Republic of China. In the "New York Times" magazine, he could not help but say that the vigorous efforts of the People's Republic of China to industrialize "are praised by vast sectors of the entire Asian population." Bowles wrote that the picture of China's construction in the eyes of the Asian people "is dangerously different from the picture we portray."

    According to the newspapers, the United States has taken steps in advance to obstruct the normal work of the conference.

    "Chicago Sun-Times" commentator Frederick Kuh reported that a special committee composed of representatives from the U.S. Department of State, the Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Foreign Operations Administration has drafted instructions regarding the Asian-African Conference, which are to be sent to U.S. embassies in various countries. According to news from "Newsweek," American diplomats have been ordered to step up activities to prevent the conference from passing resolutions demanding that representatives of the People's Republic of China be allowed to attend the United Nations and demanding that the United States withdraw from Taiwan.

    The "New York Herald Tribune" stated that the United States hopes that some countries attending the conference will uphold the policies of Western countries. As can be seen from a report in "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, figures in the U.S. Department of State are counting on causing divisions among the countries participating in the conference.

    在亚非会议即将开幕的时候
    美国政府加紧进行破坏活动
    新华社十五日讯　据塔斯社纽约十四日讯：最近几天，美国报纸被迫打破对即将开幕的亚非会议所保持的阴谋的沉默。美国报纸发表的消息证明，会议引起了美国那些正在千方百计地阻挠缓和国际局势，阻挠关于解决重要国际问题的谈判的人士日益增长的不安。
    “纽约世界电讯与太阳报”评论员丹宁指出华盛顿惊慌的原因说，会议可能“在更大的程度上破坏美国在亚洲和非洲的威信”；并斥责美国是一个帝国主义国家。他特别指出，亚非国家的大部分代表是不会支持美国占领台湾和澎湖列岛的。
    “纽约时报”记者罗森塔尔指出，亚非国家对会议异乎寻常地感到兴趣。他说，西方国家不顾那些渴望独立或已经取得独立的国家的意见，“不承认亚洲的主要事实”。记者不安地指出，中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国在亚洲国家中获得了威望，它们参加会议将“不仅是作为一个平等的成员，而且将成为注意的中心”。
    前美国驻印度大使鲍尔士也承认中华人民共和国威信的增长，他在“纽约时报”周刊上不能不说，中华人民共和国进行工业化的蓬勃努力，“使整个亚洲广大的各界人士称赞不绝”。鲍尔士写道，亚洲人民眼中的中国建设的图画“和我们所描绘图画有危险的不同”。
    根据报纸的话可以看出，美国已事先采取步骤来阻挠会议的正常工作。
      “芝加哥太阳时报”评论员弗雷德里克·库报道，由美国国务院、国防部、中央情报局、和援外事务管理署代表们组成的一个特别委员会拟定了一个关于亚非会议的指示，准备发给美国驻各国大使馆。从“新闻周刊”的消息中可以看出，美国外交家已受命加紧活动，不让会议通过要求准许中华人民共和国的代表出席联合国以及要求美国撤出台湾的决议。
      “纽约先驱论坛报”表示，美国希望出席会议的某些国家能维护西方国家的政策。从“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志的报道中也可看出，美国国务院的人物指望引起会议参与国之间的分裂。
