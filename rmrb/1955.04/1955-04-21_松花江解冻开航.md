    Songhua River Thaws and Opens to Navigation
    By our correspondent Jin Yukun

    Spring only belatedly arrives on the Songhua River after the Qingming Festival.

    The spring breeze gradually melts the snow accumulated on Changbai Mountain, the source of the Songhua River. The meltwater flows into the beautiful river as it awakens from its slumber. In early April, although the Songhua River is still frozen like a silver serpent, new signs are appearing everywhere. The snowmelt flowing into the river breaks through the ice and spreads towards both banks. At this time, the floating ice layer cracks into small pieces with a "ka-cha" sound, and ice floes begin to flow downstream. The Songhua River immediately presents a beautiful and ever-changing spectacle. In the rapids of the Songhua River, ice floes are piled up into ice mountains several people high due to the impact. Some ice floes, larger than boats, block the vicinity of the Harbin Bridge. People jump onto the ice floes, use poles to push them to the shore, or use explosives to break them up, allowing them to flow quickly past.

    By the 16th, no ice floes could be seen from the upper reaches of the Songhua River to the Harbin section, and the river flowed eastward calmly and slowly.

    On the morning of the 17th, the Harbin docks, which had been silent for a winter, suddenly became bustling. People supported the old and led the young out of the warm houses where they had been cooped up for a winter, to stroll along the riverbank or to see off relatives and friends. The docks were covered everywhere with goods like small mountains, covered with green tarpaulins. Large quantities of steel, timber, and grain were waiting to be shipped to various places. Stevedores were working hard on the docks. The ships that had been repaired in the docks during the winter were lined up along the three-mile-long bank near the docks. Sailors boarded the ships a week ago to prepare for the opening of navigation. The cabins inside and outside and the decks were scrubbed clean and bright, and refrigerators were stocked with pork, fish, shrimp, rice, noodles, etc. The newly painted ships were spewing black smoke, waiting to set sail.

    On the 17th, the Songhua River, which had been closed to navigation for five months during the winter, reopened. Participating in the first day of navigation were the Yilan passenger ship, the Jinzhou and Jilin tugboats. The passenger ship carried personnel from cooperatives to purchase goods and villagers returning home to visit relatives. The tugboats towed barges to Zhaoyuan, a famous high-yield area, to transport large quantities of grain and eggs, and to transport coal and cloth there. At twelve o'clock noon, the Yilan passenger ship first raised the red navigation flag. In the long whistle sound, the red paddlewheel stirred up the waves in the river, and the passenger ship quickly sailed upstream. People on the shore kept waving goodbye and wished them a safe journey.

    The Songhua River extends for more than 1,900 kilometers, with abundant products and beautiful scenery on both banks. On the thousand-mile navigation line, more than 600 ships will transport goods and passengers this year. In freight transportation, the volume of timber transportation will account for 60 percent. The logs from the Xiaoxing'anling forest area will be transported by water to Harbin and Jiamusi, and then by train to all parts of the country. The sorghum, soybeans, millet, rice, and wheat produced on both banks of the middle reaches of the Songhua River will also be transported through the Songhua River navigation. The famous local products of Daxing'anling and Xiaoxing'anling, such as ginseng, antlers, tiger bones, bear bile, gray squirrel, sable fur, otter, and edible fungus, mushrooms, and great taimen, will also be transported out through the Songhua River. The Songhua River's shipping volume ranks third in the country, second only to the Yangtze River and the Pearl River. The Songhua River's shipping is developing year by year. This year's transportation task will increase by 25 percent compared to last year.

    松花江解冻开航
    本报记者　金雨困
    清明过后，春天才迟迟地来到松花江上。
    春风逐渐溶化了松花江发源地的长白山上的积雪。雪水流入了沉睡着的美丽的大江。四月上旬，松花江虽然还像银蛇一样冰封着，但处处呈现新的迹象。流入江中的雪水，突破了冰层，向两岸漫延上去。这时，飘浮起来的冰层，卡擦卡擦地破裂为小块，冰排就开始下流了。松花江上马上出现了千变万化的美丽奇景。在松花江激流处，冰排因冲击而堆成数人高的冰山。有些比船还大的冰排阻塞在哈尔滨大桥附近，人们就跳上冰排，用杆子把它撑到岸边去，或用炸药把它炸碎，使冰排迅速地流过去。
    到十六日，从松花江上游到哈尔滨一段已经看不到冰排，江水平静缓慢地向东流去。
    十七日上午，沉寂了一冬的哈尔滨码头突然地熙熙攘攘起来。人们扶老携幼走出闷了一冬的暖屋，来到江沿漫游，或送别亲友。码头上到处是用绿色雨布盖着像小山似的货物，大批钢材、木材和粮食在等待着运往各地。搬运工人在码头上紧张地劳动。冬季在船坞里整修的船只，都已排列在码头附近三里长的岸边。海员们一星期前就上船进行开航的准备工作，船舱内外和甲板都擦洗得干净明亮，冷藏冰箱中储放了猪肉、鱼虾、米面等。新油漆过的轮船吐着黑烟，等待着开航。
    十七日，在冬季里停航了五个月的松花江又开航了。参加第一天开航的，有依兰号客轮、锦州号和吉林号拖轮。在客轮上载送着合作社办货的人员和回乡探亲的老乡们。拖轮拖带着驳船将到著名的丰产区肇源去运大批粮食和鸡蛋，并把煤和布匹运到那里去。中午十二时整，依兰号客轮首先升上红色的航旗，汽笛长鸣声中，红色的轮板激起江中水浪，客轮迅速向上游驶去。岸上的人们不断挥手告别，并祝他们旅程平安。
    松花江绵延一千九百多公里，两岸物产丰富，风景美丽。在千里航线上，今年将有六百多艘船只运送货物和旅客。在货运中，木材的运输量将占百分之六十，小兴安岭林区的原木，将由水上运到哈尔滨和佳木斯，再由火车运往全国各地。松花江中游两岸盛产的高粱、大豆、小米、水稻、小麦，也将经过松花江航运，转运入关。大小兴安岭里有名的土产人参、鹿茸、虎骨、熊胆、灰鼠、貂皮、水獭和木耳、蘑菇、大玛哈鱼，也将经过松花江外运。松花江航运量仅次于长江、珠江，而居全国的第三位。松花江的航运逐年在发展着。今年的运输任务将比去年增加百分之二十五。
