Pilot Experience of Organizing Merchant Cooperative Groups in Majuqiao Town, Tong County
Ge Wei

Editor's Note: In the past six months, various regions have carried out arrangements and transformations of rural private merchants to varying degrees. The pilot experience of organizing small merchants into cooperative groups in Majuqiao Town, Tong County, published here, can be used as a reference for various regions in carrying out the transformation of rural private merchants. However, in carrying out transformation work, attention must be paid to the overall arrangement of the market to prevent the phenomenon of squeezing out the majority of private merchants by transforming only a few.

At the end of last year, the Tong County Office of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative conducted a pilot project in Majuqiao Town in the district to transform small merchants and peddlers according to cooperative principles, and organized several purely commercial small merchants into a cooperative group of the same industry and a cooperative group of four mixed industries.

Small merchants and peddlers were very happy to learn that they belonged to the scope of the working people and could take the road of mutual assistance and cooperation. Zhao Rongxuan, a small grocery merchant, said: "I used to think that the cooperative would squeeze us out sooner or later, but I didn't expect that this time they would lead us to organize." Some people immediately showed that they wanted to move closer to the supply and marketing cooperative and strive for transformation. However, when further considering organizing, they still had many concerns, such as: the amount of capital of each household is different, the operating skills are different, and they are afraid of suffering losses when combined; those who are currently experiencing operating difficulties are afraid of affecting their income and being unable to maintain their lives due to changes in operating methods; there has always been the idea of ​​"the same industry is a rival" and "business is easy to do, but it is difficult to get along with partners," and they are afraid of causing disputes when combined; they are afraid of complicated procedures, strict management, and lack of freedom; some people also intend to enjoy more preferential treatment after organizing. In response to these ideological situations, the Tong County Office of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative explained to them the reasons for organizing, emphasizing that they should strive for transformation; at the same time, it also appropriately pointed out: after organizing and incorporating into the business plan of the supply and marketing cooperative, the source of goods is guaranteed and can be given priority supply.

After dispelling ideological concerns, two different organizational forms were adopted for the two groups according to the characteristics of each household's capital status, technical level, and operating methods. The same-industry group is composed of two grocery merchants. Although the amount of capital of these two households is roughly the same, their operating skills are different, and one store is at the head of the street and the other is in the middle of the street. If they are concentrated for operation, both parties have concerns, so a method of capital investment, unified procurement, decentralized operation, and contracted expenses is adopted. The other group is a mixed group, consisting of four households of cloth, groceries, department stores, and stationery. Although the capital of these four households varies, the nature of the industries is roughly similar, and the operating skills and living standards are roughly the same, so it was decided to adopt the method of capital and personnel investment, joint rental of storefronts, centralized operation, and unified accounting.

It is very important to carefully handle some specific issues of organization according to the principle of voluntary mutual assistance. The first is the issue of equity participation. In order to meet the requirements of the industrial and commercial and tax departments and prevent the opportunity to withdraw funds, both groups adopted the method of all existing property as equity. Existing property includes cash, goods, accounts receivable, and fixed assets. The method of pricing commodities is determined that all those available in the supply and marketing cooperative are priced according to the wholesale price of the supply and marketing cooperative, and the rest are calculated according to the purchase price. Because commercial turnover is mainly working capital, fixed assets are only invested but not divided into dividends, and external debts are not divided into dividends because they have not been recovered and cannot be added to turnover. In terms of internal management and personnel division of labor, the same-industry group does not have full-time administrative personnel, and only selects one group leader and one chief accountant, who are responsible for the leadership of daily business and the recording and settlement of accounts, respectively, but they still operate the business as usual, which is basically a collective management system. In addition to selecting a group leader, the mixed group also has a fixed accountant. The group leader studies and handles daily affairs according to the principle of democratic centralism. Profit distribution and wages: The same-industry group deducts 1.5% of the total difference between sales income and expenses as direct expenses, and the remaining 80% is used as labor dividends, and the distribution method is based on the proportion of the difference earned by the group members' operations; the mixed group distributes dividends according to the ratio of labor to capital of seven to three based on the net profit earned. Public accumulation funds and public welfare funds are extracted according to the principle of first small and then large, but if the group is disbanded for some reason, the public accumulation funds must be turned over to the supply and marketing cooperative. In terms of sources of goods and prices, it is stipulated that all sources of goods that the supply and marketing cooperative can supply shall be purchased by the supply and marketing cooperative, and in addition, they are allowed to find their own sources of goods. The main commodities purchased by the supply and marketing cooperative are all subject to the listed price of the supply and marketing cooperative, sporadic commodities are priced by negotiation, and the prices of commodities found by themselves are determined by the group. The main contents of the articles of association of the two groups include the above items, as well as: A. Obey the leadership of the state-owned economy and the supply and marketing cooperative; B. Adopt the principle of voluntary organization and only small merchants and peddlers who rely on their own labor or mainly on their own labor can join the group; C. Obey policies and laws and establish the commercial ethics of "fair scales and feet, genuine goods at a fair price"; D. Determine several necessary systems such as learning, meetings, leave, and loans.

After being organized, the sales volume has increased significantly due to the unified use of funds, the increase in commodity varieties, and the rational use of manpower. According to the statistics of the sales volume of the five days before the organization from November 21 to 26, 1954, the same-industry group was 209 yuan, and the mixed group was 301 yuan; according to the statistics of the sales volume of the five days after the organization from December 1 to 6 of the same year, the same-industry group was 334 yuan, an increase of 59.8%; the mixed group was 484 yuan, an increase of 60.7%. Because the assessment of the turnover of the cooperative group is determined after estimating the purchasing power of the entire region and checking the market capacity and taking into account the arrangements for other private merchants in the same industry, this avoids the bias of squeezing out private merchants in the same industry due to the arrangement of the group.

The practice of pilot work proves that the road of transforming rural small merchants and peddlers through mutual assistance and cooperation is correct. First of all, after being organized, the operation of small merchants and peddlers is incorporated into the business plan of the supply and marketing cooperative, and the supply and marketing cooperative can use their manpower, funds, and technology to better serve the improvement of supply to rural areas and the expansion of commodity circulation. To a large extent, this turns the market into a controllable and led market. On the other hand, with the leadership of the supply and marketing cooperative, small merchants and peddlers have consistent prices, a normal supply of goods, and an expanded turnover; they are "separated from the capitalists," have a status, enter the "main door," and have both fame and profit. Therefore, their morale is high and their operations are active. Secondly, according to the experience of this pilot work, it is not appropriate to emphasize specialized industries when organizing rural small merchants, because rural private merchants are scattered and scattered. If it is emphasized that only the same industry can be organized, it will be difficult. Generally speaking, industries that are roughly similar can be organized. It not only meets the purchasing habits of farmers, but also regulates the imbalance of peak and off-season operations to a large extent.

Small merchants are laborers, but they have different characteristics from farmers and small handicraftsmen. Small merchants carry out labor in commodity circulation to obtain remuneration. Their spontaneous capitalist ideas of only seeking profit and engaging in speculation are more serious. Once their business improves, this idea is more likely to grow. Therefore, the supply and marketing cooperative must always strengthen its business leadership and ideological education to prevent the growth and development of spontaneous capitalist ideas.

    通县马驹桥镇组织商人合作小组试点经验
    葛为
    编者按：近半年来，各地对农村私商已进行了不同程度的安排和改造工作。这里发表的通县马驹桥镇组织小商人成立合作小组的试点经验，可供各地进行改造农村私商工作的参考。但在进行改造工作时，必须注意对市场的全面安排，防止发生因改造了少数私商而挤掉了多数私商的现象。
    河北省供销合作社通县专区办事处，去年年底在这个专区的马驹桥镇进行了按合作社的原则改造小商小贩的试点工作，把几户纯商业的小商人组成了一个同行业的合作小组和一个四种行业混合的合作小组。
    小商小贩了解他们属于劳动人民的范围，并可以走互助合作的道路后，感到非常愉快。杂货小商人赵荣轩说：“过去认为合作社早晚会把我们挤垮，没想到这回还领导我们组织起来。”有些人立刻表现了要向供销社靠拢，争取改造。但在进一步酝酿组织起来时，他们还有不少顾虑，比如：各户资金大小不同，经营技术各异，怕合起来吃亏；当前经营困难的，怕因改变经营方式影响收入，不能维持生活；历来有所谓“同行是冤家”、“买卖好做，伙计难搭”的想法，怕合起来闹纠纷；怕手续多，管理严，不自由；有些人也有企图组织起来以后多享受优待等打算。针对这些思想情况，河北省供销社通县专区办事处，向他们说明了为什么要组织起来的道理，强调了应当努力争取改造；同时还适当指出：组织起来纳入供销社的经营计划之内，货源有了保证，并可优先供应。
    打消思想顾虑之后，就根据各户资金状况、技术水平、经营方式等方面的特点，对两个小组采取了不同的组织形式。同行业小组是由两户杂货座商组成。这两户虽然资金额大致相同，但经营技术不一，而且一个门市在街头，一个在街中，如果集中经营双方都有顾虑，因而采取了资金入股、统一进货、分散经营、费用包干的办法。另一组是混合小组，由布疋、杂货、百货、文具四户组成。这四户的资金虽各有出入，但行业性质大体接近，经营技术和生活水平大致相同，因而确定采取资金、人员入股、合租门面、集中经营、统一核算的办法。
    按照自愿互助原则慎重处理组织起来的一些具体问题是很重要的。首先是入股问题。为了适合工商、税务部门的要求和防止借机抽逃资金，两个小组都采取现有财产全部入股的办法。现有财产包括现金、商品、应收账款、固定资产等。其中商品作价办法确定凡供销社有的都按供销社批发价作价，其余按进货价计算。因商业周转主要是流动资金，固定资产只入股不分红，外欠资金因尚未收回以致不能加入周转的也不分红。在内部管理和人员分工方面，同行业小组没有专职行政人员，只选出小组长和总会计各一人，分别负责日常业务的领导和账务的记载、结算，但本人仍照常经营业务，基本上是集体管理制度。混合小组除选出小组长一人外，还设固定会计一人。组长根据民主集中制原则研究处理日常事务。盈余分配和工资问题：同行业小组在销货所得差价总额中包干扣除百分之一点五作为直接费用，其余以百分之八十作为劳动分红，分配办法是按组员经营所得差价比例提取；混合小组按所得纯利以劳七资三的比例分红。公积金、公益金本先少后多的原则提取，但小组如果因故解散时，公积金得上缴供销社。在货源和价格问题方面，规定凡供销社能够供应的货源，统由供销社进货，此外，并允许自寻货源。由供销社进货的主要商品，均执行供销社牌价，零星商品采取议价办法，自找货源的商品价格由小组自定。两个小组组织章程的主要内容除包括上述各项外，还列有：甲、服从国营经济和供销社的领导；乙、采取自愿组织原则和必须是靠自己劳动或主要靠自己劳动的小商小贩方得入组；丙、服从政策法令、树立“秤平尺足，货真价实”的商业道德；丁、确定学习、会议、请假、借款等几条必要的制度。
    组织起来后，由于资金的统一运用，商品品种的增加，人力的合理利用，销货额已有显著增加。根据一九五四年十一月二十一日到二十六日组织起来以前五天销货额的统计，同行业小组是二百零九元，混合小组是三百零一元；根据同年十二月一日到六日组织起来以后的五天销货额的统计，同行业小组是三百三十四元，较前上升了百分之五十九点八；混合小组是四百八十四元，上升了百分之六十点七。由于对合作小组营业额的核定是在概算全区购买力并查清市场容量、照顾到其它同行业私商的安排之后确定的，这样就避免了因安排小组而挤掉同一行业私商的偏向。
    试点工作实践证明，通过互助合作改造农村小商小贩的道路是正确的。首先，组织起来之后，小商小贩的经营就纳入了供销社经营计划之内，供销社可以利用他们的人力、资金和技术更好地为改善对农村的供应和扩大商品流转服务，这就在很大程度上把市场变为能够控制和有领导的市场。另一方面，小商小贩有了供销社的领导，货价一致，货源得到正常供应，经营额扩大；“同资本家分了家”，有了地位，入了“正门”，有名有利，因而情绪高涨，经营积极。其次，根据这次试点工作的体会，组织农村小商人不宜强调专行专业，因为农村私商零星分散，如果强调只有同一行业才能组织起来，是有困难的。一般地说只要大体相近的行业就可组织起来。它不但符合农民购买习惯，而且在很大程度上调节了淡旺季经营的不平衡性。
    小商人是劳动者，但同农民、小手工业者有不同的特点。小商人是在商品流转中进行劳动获取报酬的。他们唯利是图投机倒把的自发的资本主义思想较为严重。当他们经营一旦好转时，这种思想就更容易滋长。因此供销社必须经常加强对他们的业务领导和思想教育，防止自发的资本主义思想的滋长和发展。
