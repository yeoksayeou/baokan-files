April 16th was market day in Kaili Town, in the Miaoling Mountains. The agricultural implements retail department of the town's supply and marketing cooperative had long been prepared with goods to welcome the Miao customers engaged in spring plowing. To the left of the retail department were newly manufactured mountain plows and new-style walking plows, boxes of "666" insecticide powder, and more than 200,000 catties of gypsum recently transported from other places; the counters on the right were filled with various iron agricultural implements. In order to facilitate farmers' selection of agricultural implements, the sales staff specially set up two stalls at the entrance, displaying locally processed plowshares, harrows, and other tools based on the farmers' production habits.

At noon, people thronged into Kaili for the market. After selling mountain specialties such as tung oil, animal hides, and medicinal herbs, they flocked to the agricultural implements stalls to select the plowshares urgently needed for spring plowing. They were extremely satisfied to see four or five different specifications and styles of plowshares on the stalls. A group of members from the Wengya Township National Agricultural Production Cooperative entered the retail department, specifically to buy a sprayer to prevent insect infestations of rice seedlings this year. The members said: With a sprayer, increased production will be even more guaranteed. That evening, the sales staff of the supply and marketing cooperative calculated the accounts and found that 218 large agricultural implements such as plowshares, large hoes, and water harrows were sold on this day, and the sales of production materials reached 1,370 yuan, an increase of 40 percent over the same period last year.

    苗岭凯里镇的赶集天
    新华社记者　刘扬深
    四月十六日是苗岭山中凯里镇的赶集天。镇上的供销合作社农具门市部早就准备好商品迎接春耕中的苗族顾客。在门市部的左边，放着新出厂的山地犁、新式步犁，成箱的“六六六”杀虫药粉和刚从外地运到的二十多万斤石膏；右边的柜台里摆满了各式各样的铁质农具。营业员们为了便利农民选购农具，特别在门口设了两个货摊，陈列着根据农民生产习惯在当地加工的犁铧、钉耙等。
    中午，赶集的人拥进凯里。他们卖出了桐油、畜皮、药材等山区土产以后，纷纷围到农具摊边，挑选目前春耕中急需的铧口。他们看到摊子上有四、五种不同规格样式的铧口满意极了。翁牙乡民族农业生产合作社的一群社员走进了门市部，他们为了防止今年秧苗生虫，特来买一架喷雾器，社员们说：有了喷雾器，增产就更有保证了。当晚供销合作社营业员算了算帐，这天卖出犁铧、大锄、水耙等大件农具二百一十八件，生产资料的售货额达一千三百七十元，比去年同期增加百分之四十。
