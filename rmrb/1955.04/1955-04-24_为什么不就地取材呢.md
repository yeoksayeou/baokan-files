Why Not Use Local Materials?
	Wen Bin

	At a waterproofing project site of the Jingxi Mining Bureau, I saw a continuous stream of large trucks and donkeys carrying large amounts of soil and gravel outwards; but at the same time, I also saw a steady flow of fine sand and rubble being transported in.

	Why is this happening? It turns out that this waterproofing project is a major part of the Jingxi Mining Bureau's Mentougou Mine recovery project. The purpose of the project is to prevent the recovered mine from being flooded again. The main part of the project is to reinforce the bottom of a main ditch, about six kilometers long, using mortar-laid rubble and concrete, etc., to prevent leakage. The materials used are mainly fine sand, rubble, crushed gravel, plus cement. After the designers proposed the specifications and quantities of sand and gravel required for the design, the owner of this self-operated project, the Jingxi Mining Bureau, sent people to Beijing to order 6,000 cubic meters of fine sand, and ordered 40,000 cubic meters of rubble nearby. The unit price of fine sand is 8.25 yuan per cubic meter, and the unit price of rubble is 5 yuan per cubic meter.

	However, according to the design requirements, before the main ditch bottom is reinforced, a large amount of mud, sand, and pebbles of all sizes must be cleared from the ditch bottom. According to an engineer from the Ministry of Fuel Industry who inspected the site, it was believed that 60 percent of fine sand could be washed out from the sand and gravel cleared from the ditch bottom, and the quality and quantity were both sufficient. If these sands and gravels could be washed and used by themselves, the unit price would only be 3.5 yuan per cubic meter, which is more than half cheaper than buying from Beijing. But unfortunately, a large part of these sands and gravels have already been transported away, and are still being transported away to this day. Take rubble as an example: the specifications were not originally required to be very strict, it was only used to build the sides and bottom of the ditch. The pebbles of all sizes in the ditch can be used completely after being crushed, but the designers did not consider this. Even more strange is that there is an inexhaustible supply of crushed stone at the construction site, but they still have to buy it from outside.

	This construction site is at the gate of the Jingxi Mining Bureau, and the designers are also designing in the Jingxi Mining Bureau's office, which is no more than 500 meters from the construction site. Can it be said that they are unaware of the situation? Moreover, the personnel from the Ministry of Fuel Industry who went to inspect the work had suggested that the stones cleared from the bottom of the ditch should be used. But until now, sand and gravel are still being transported out on one side and transported in on the other. What an unnecessary waste this is! May I ask the design comrades of the Jingxi Mining Bureau, why don't you use local materials?

    为什么不就地取材呢
    文彬
    在京西矿务局一个防水工程的工地上，我看到络绎不绝的大车和毛驴，载着大量的泥土和砂石往外运；但同时又看到了大量的细砂和片石源源不断地运进来。
    为什么会发生这种现象呢？原来是这样的：这个防水工程是京西矿务局门头沟矿恢复工程中的一个主要部分。工程的目的是为了使恢复后的这个矿井不再被水淹掉。工程的主要部分是在一条长约六公里的主沟沟底，用砂浆砌片石和打混凝土等法进行加固，以防漏水。所用的材料主要是细砂、片石、碎砂，外加水泥。当设计人员提出设计所需要砂石的规格、数量后，这个自营工程的主人——京西矿务局就派人到北京订购了六千立方公尺的细砂，又在附近订购了四万立方公尺的片石。细砂每立方公尺的单价是八元二角五分，片石每立方公尺的单价是五元。
    但同时按设计要求，这条主沟沟底在加固以前，必须将沟底大量的泥砂和大小卵石全部清理出去。据燃料工业部一位工程师检查，认为这些从沟底清理出来的砂石可洗出百分之六十的细砂，而且不仅质量合格，数量也很多。如果能把这些砂石自洗自用，每立方公尺的单价只要三元五角，比从北京买来的要便宜一半以上。但可惜这些砂石有很大一部分早已运走了，而且直到现在仍还在运。就拿片石来说吧，从规格上说本来不是要求很严格的，只是用来砌沟帮沟底的，沟内的大小卵石炸碎后完全可以使用，可是设计人员并没有考虑到。更奇怪的是：工地上本来就有取之不尽，用之不竭的碎石，可是还要到外面去买。
    这个工地在京西矿务局的大门口，设计人员也是坐在京西矿务局办公室里进行设计的，距工地最多不过有五百公尺，难道能说是不了解情况吗？并且燃料工业部去检查工作的人员，曾提出过应该使用沟底清理出来的石头。可是到现在，砂石仍在一面运出，一面运进，这是多么不应有的浪费啊！请问京西矿务局的设计工作同志们，你们为什么不就地取材呢？
