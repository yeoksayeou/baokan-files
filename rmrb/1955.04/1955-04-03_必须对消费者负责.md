    Must Be Responsible to Consumers
    Jiang Liang
    Since supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have been responsible for arranging the rural market and implementing the policy of utilizing and transforming private merchants, great achievements have been made. However, a small number of supply and marketing cooperatives in some areas have distorted this policy in their actual work, operating passively and retreating step by step. As a result, the exchange of goods in these areas has not become smoother, but has instead shrunk.
    In order to give private merchants something to do, some supply and marketing cooperatives have begun to "contract their positions" on a large scale. However, since there are not many private merchants in the local area, that is, they are leaving things to people who do not exist, problems are bound to occur. In the Eighth District of Minhou County, Fujian Province, there are only a few small vendors, but the supply and marketing cooperative still inappropriately reduced its business. Under normal circumstances, this district sells three pigs a day. After the supply and marketing cooperative reduced its business, it was reduced to one pig every three days. The supply of pork fell short of demand, and the masses scrambled to buy it, creating very chaotic order. Yong'an County has four grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives that have reduced their retail plans, but there are no private merchants in the area. In other areas, there are also many supply and marketing cooperatives that are tied up and doing everything possible to compress sales volume. Some superior cooperatives do not or seldom allocate goods to subordinate cooperatives; subordinate cooperatives allow goods to be out of stock, but do not ask the superior cooperatives to allocate goods; some goods that are not in short supply are also subject to limited supply; some fast-selling goods such as cotton cloth, sanitary clothing, wool, and thermos bottles, which are urgently needed by the masses, are actually put away and not sold.
    In order to solve the problem that its own retail business is too heavy and the business of small merchants and peddlers is too light, the supply and marketing cooperative should appropriately control and tighten its own retail sales and open and expand wholesale business to small merchants and peddlers. This is appropriate and necessary. This can better expand commodity circulation and ensure market supply. However, in areas where there are no or very few private merchants, in terms of commodities that private merchants do not operate at all, it is completely wrong to mechanically implement the "stay-in-place" policy, blindly reduce retail plans, and accumulate commodities that should be sold, so that the masses cannot buy what they can buy. These supply and marketing cooperatives should quickly change this irresponsible attitude towards consumers and do a solid job of doing what should be done, in order to restore normal commodity circulation and ensure market supply.

    必须对消费者负责
    江粱
    自从各地供销合作社负责安排农村市场，贯彻利用、改造私商的政策以来，已经取得很大的成绩。但是，有少数地区的供销合作社，在实际工作中歪曲了这个政策，消极经营，步步退缩，因此，这些地区的物资交流不是更流畅，而是更萎缩了。
    某些供销社为了让私商有事可作，就来大规模地“收缩阵地”。可是，由于当地并没有多少私商，就是说，它们把事情留给了并不存在的人，这就难免发生问题了。福建省闽侯县八区只有几户小商贩，供销社依然不适当地缩小业务。在正常情况下，这个区每天销售三口猪，供销社缩小业务以后，减为三天杀一口。猪肉供不应求，群众争先抢购，秩序非常混乱。永安县有四个基层供销社削减了零售计划，但当地并无私商。在其他地区，也有不少供销社束手束脚，想尽办法压缩销货量。有些上级社不给或少给下级社拨发货物；下级社听任商品脱销，但不要求上级社调拨货物；有些货物的货源本来不缺，也来限量供应；有些为群众迫切需要的棉布、卫生衣、毛线、暖水瓶等畅销货，竟被收起不卖。
    供销社为了解决本身零售业务过于繁重，小商小贩营业过分清淡的问题，适当控制和紧缩本身的零售额，开办和扩大对小商小贩的批发业务，这是应该的、必要的。这样能够更好地扩大商品流转，保证市场供应。但是，在没有或只有很少的私商的地区，在私商根本不经营的商品方面，机械地执行“踏步”政策，盲目削减零售计划，把应该销售的商品积压起来，使群众不能买到可以买到的东西，这就完全错误了。这些供销合作社应该赶快改变这种对消费者不负责任的态度，把应该办的事情切实办好，以便恢复正常的商品流转，保证市场的供应。
