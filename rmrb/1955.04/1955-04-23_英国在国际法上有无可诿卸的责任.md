Britain Has Inescapable Responsibility Under International Law
Chen Tiqiang, Director of the China Political Science and Law Association

Following the plane crash involving staff members of our delegation to the Asian-African Conference and foreign journalists, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a solemn statement on April 12, sternly pointing out that this incident was the result of a destructive conspiracy by US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents. The British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong bear a serious responsibility for this incident, and they were asked to conduct a thorough investigation and bring the secret agents involved in this conspiracy to justice. However, the British government initially claimed that the cause of the crash was still under investigation, and then, on the 17th, presented a note to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, simply denying any responsibility for the incident. At the same time, British and American propaganda machines shamelessly fabricated various absurd rumors, trying to create a false impression by blaming the plane crash on mechanical failure and the plane's unsuitability for flight, that is to say, shifting the responsibility onto Air India International. The purpose of these actions by the British and Americans is to cover up the criminal nature of the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agent assassination plot, protect these secret agents from investigation, and take the opportunity to sow discord between China and India.

However, on the same day that Britain presented the note to us, Air India International issued a statement on the plane crash, thoroughly exposing the lies of the British and Americans, shattering their poisonous plan to shift the blame, and confirming the solemn accusation of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, rightfully placing the responsibility for the plane crash on the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents and the British authorities.

Air India International's statement is a necessary and sufficient proof for determining the responsibility for this plane crash. It can now be determined without any doubt that the plane's explosion was the result of US-Chiang Kai-shek murderer agents placing explosives on the plane while it was in Hong Kong. There is no question that the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents are the primary culprits, and there is no need to elaborate on this here. What needs to be studied here is: Does the British authorities have any responsibility? How great is the responsibility?

First of all, it is certain that the criminal act of the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents carrying out the assassination plot occurred in Hong Kong under the jurisdiction of the British authorities. Although the plane exploded outside the jurisdiction of the British authorities in Hong Kong, the final criminal act that caused the plane to explode was completed in Hong Kong. Therefore, the place of the crime is Hong Kong, not the place where the explosion occurred. There is international precedent to prove this. In 1918, an American court convicted a person who conspired to place explosives on ships departing from New York during World War I. The defendant argued that his plan was to have the explosives explode after the ship left US territorial waters, and therefore was not subject to the jurisdiction of the US court, but the court ruled that regardless of where the consequences occurred, "the criminal act occurred at the place of the act." In 1917, the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil made the same ruling in a similar case. These examples show that regardless of where the consequences occurred, the place of the crime is Hong Kong, and therefore it is inseparable from the responsibility of the British authorities in Hong Kong. The British note claimed that the crash did not occur within British territory or territorial waters, and therefore a formal investigation into the cause of the incident "is not a matter for the Queen's government." This statement is completely untenable.

The British authorities in Hong Kong are responsible for preventing and punishing all incidents that occur in Hong Kong. But on both of these points, the British authorities in Hong Kong have not done enough, especially in terms of post-incident punishment, it is simply not done at all, so it bears a major responsibility for this incident.

According to international law, the British authorities in Hong Kong should have given "due diligence" to various situations. A well-known American international law scholar, Eagleton, pointed out in his book "State Responsibility in International Law": "If a warning is given in a timely manner, there will be time to take appropriate preventive measures; if the danger is obvious and frequent; or if there are certain special circumstances that must be given special attention, then, obviously, the degree of attention required should be measured accordingly." Similarly, British international law scholar Hall pointed out in his "International Law": "If these actions are open and well-known, and if they are quite important, then, obviously, the state is responsible for not using proper means to suppress them."

These scholars' opinions are supported by many international precedents. In 1887, an American was killed by bandits in Mexico. US Secretary of State Blaine issued instructions to US Chargé d'Affaires in Mexico, Dougherty, on January 5, 1891, saying: "The federal and state authorities have been given the fullest notice, telling them the illegal behavior of the people committing this crime... those in danger have repeatedly made the most urgent appeals to these authorities, but these authorities have not taken serious steps to protect them." Therefore, the United States believes that Mexico should be responsible for the losses of American citizens.

On October 9, 1934, King Alexander of Yugoslavia and French Foreign Minister Barthou were assassinated in Marseille, France. The terrorists who carried out these assassinations were said to be fascist bandits who had previously been active in Hungary. On December 10, the Council of the League of Nations passed a resolution stating: "Every country has an obligation not to encourage or tolerate any terrorist activities with political purposes carried out within its territory. Every country must do its utmost to prevent and suppress such acts, and must assist all governments requesting assistance for this purpose." The resolution considered that certain Hungarian authorities "bear some responsibility, at least through negligence, for acts related to the preparation of this crime," and that "the Hungarian government has a responsibility... to take immediate punitive action when the guilt of any of its authorities is established."

In a famous case ruled by the Permanent Court of International Justice, the "Lotus" case (1927), Judge Moore of the United States declared:
	"It is a recognized principle that a country has an obligation to use due diligence to prevent criminal acts against other countries or their people from occurring within its territory."

These principles of international law and international precedents undoubtedly point out that the British authorities in Hong Kong bear a serious responsibility for the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agent assassination incident.

First of all, the warnings given by our government to the British authorities regarding the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agent's destructive conspiracy cannot be said to be untimely. The British authorities in Hong Kong had a full 24 hours to take preventive measures. Secondly, the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agent's assassination plot cannot be said to be unclear. Who doesn't know that Hong Kong has been a nest for US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents since the liberation of mainland China? What are the more than three hundred staff members of the US Consulate in Hong Kong doing? What about the thousands of people recruited in Hong Kong by the Chiang Kai-shek spy organization "Free China Movement" under the control of the US Central Intelligence Agency under the name of "Far East Reclamation Company"? Doesn't the British authorities in Hong Kong know this better than anyone else? The assassination of General Yang Jie in 1949, the sinking of the British merchant ship "Zesheng" bound for Tianjin, the bombing of our seven aircraft at Kai Tak Airport in 1950, the bombing of our ship "Haixia" in the same year, and the hijacking of five uprising fishing boats in broad daylight by Chiang Kai-shek secret agents – have the British authorities in Hong Kong completely forgotten these facts of secret agents running rampant? Even the United Press International could not but admit that some of the staff at Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport belonged to so-called "anti-communist" trade unions, which are actually "trade unions" controlled by secret agents. So the matter is very clear: Given these well-known facts, even without our timely warning beforehand, the British authorities in Hong Kong should have taken the most complete preventive measures against possible destructive activities by US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents. The British side claimed that the warning we gave was not "detailed" enough. Does the British side think that we must specifically list the names of the secret agents and the destructive methods they will take, and issue instructions to the Hong Kong police authorities on preventing such destruction? If so, this would be admitting that the British authorities no longer have the ability to maintain law and order in Hong Kong and protect passing travelers.

In fact, the responsibility of the British authorities in Hong Kong is aggravated by another circumstance. This circumstance is that the passengers on the "Kashmir Princess" were not ordinary passengers, but members of a delegation from the Chinese government attending an international conference. International law recognizes that diplomatic personnel should receive special protection. Oppenheim said: "The protection of diplomats is manifested not only in the necessary police measures to prevent offenses, but also in the particularly severe punishment of offenders." Similarly, the report submitted by the League of Nations Committee of Jurists on the assassination of Italian General Tellini in Greece also stated: "The recognized official status of a foreigner and his presence on the territory of a country impose corresponding obligations on that country to provide special vigilance." And what protection measures did the British authorities in Hong Kong take for our delegation attending the Asian-African Conference, even after being warned? It only conducted general vigilance on the plane, its purpose being only to "ensure that this group of people is not harassed at the airport." This measure can by no means be said to have exhausted "due diligence" commensurate with the seriousness of the situation at the time.

Judging from the attitude taken by the British authorities in Hong Kong after the incident to arrest the murderers and punish the criminals, it is also difficult to believe that it has fully recognized the seriousness of its responsibilities. This attitude can by no means show that it has fulfilled the obligations that friendly countries should fulfill. US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents are clustered in Hong Kong, which has always posed a serious threat to the security of the People's Republic of China. As a friendly country, the British government, according to the above-mentioned principles and precedents of international law, should have done everything in its power to sanction and suppress these secret agents. Now, the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents have once again used Hong Kong as a base to carry out a bloody murder of our diplomatic personnel, which is intolerable, and the British authorities are still doing everything possible to cover up for these secret agents. What is its intention? The British government attempts to use the excuse that the explosion occurred outside British territory and territorial waters to evade its responsibility for investigation. But since this criminal act occurred and was completed in Hong Kong, the investigation only needs and can only be conducted in Hong Kong. To get to the bottom of the matter, it is only necessary to seriously interrogate those US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents who appear in Hong Kong in an open or semi-open manner. However, the British authorities in Hong Kong not only did not do this, but spent more time unreasonably summoning our personnel and members of progressive trade unions, which fully demonstrates that it is deliberately shielding and condoning the real murderers. From the attitude of the British authorities in Hong Kong after the incident towards punishing the murderers, it can also be clearly seen that it has not fulfilled its obligations under international law, thus aggravating its responsibility for this incident.

The British authorities' attempt to shirk its serious responsibility by means of sophistry and denial is impossible. Only by seriously taking severe measures, thoroughly investigating the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agent organizations hiding in Hong Kong, and pursuing the masterminds and direct participants in the action from their close interrogation, and severely punishing them according to law, can the serious responsibility that the British authorities should bear for this incident be reduced. The Chinese people demand this, and international law and international justice also demand this.

    英国在国际法上有无可诿卸的责任
    中国政治法律学会理事　陈体强
    我国参加亚非会议代表团工作人员及中外新闻记者的座机失事后，我国外交部即于四月十二日发表声明，严正指出这次事件是美蒋特务的破坏阴谋的结果，英国政府和香港英国当局对这次事件负有严重责任，并要求英国政府和香港英国当局进行彻底查究，将参与这一阴谋的特务分子逮捕法办。然而英国政府初则推说失事原因尚待查明，继而于十七日向我国外交部提出照会，干脆对这事件的责任推卸得一干二净。同时英美宣传机关还无耻制造各种荒谬谣言，力图造成错误印象，把飞机失事的原因归咎于机件故障和飞机不适航行，也就是说，把责任推在印度国际航空公司的身上。英美的这些做法，目的是要掩盖美蒋特务暗杀阴谋的罪恶性质，包庇这些特务分子，使他们免于查究，同时又可以乘机挑拨中印关系。
    但是，就在英国向我提出照会的同日，印度国际航空公司发表了关于飞机坠毁事件的声明，彻底揭穿了英美的谎言，粉碎了英美嫁祸于人的毒计，证实了我国外交部的严正指责，而把飞机失事的责任正当地放在美蒋特务和英国当局的身上。
    印度国际航空公司的声明，是断定这次坠机事件的责任的必要和充分的证明。现在已经可以毫无疑义地断定：飞机的爆炸是美蒋特务杀人犯在飞机在香港停留时在飞机上安置爆炸物的结果。美蒋特务是首恶元凶，这是没有问题的，在这里不必细论；这里所要研究的是：英国当局有没有责任？责任有多大？
    首先，可以肯定的，美蒋特务执行暗杀阴谋的犯罪行为是在香港英国当局管辖之下的地方发生的。虽然飞机是在香港英国当局管辖权范围以外的地方爆炸的，但使飞机爆炸的最后犯罪行为却是在香港完成的。因此，这件犯罪行为的行为地是香港，而不是在爆炸发生的地点。关于这一点是有国际先例为证的。一九一八年美国一个法院曾对一个在第一次世界大战期间阴谋把爆炸物放置在从纽约驶出的船只上的人加以判罪。被告辩称他的计划是要使爆炸物在船驶离美国领水以后爆炸，因此不受美国法院管辖，但法院判称，不管后果在那里发生，“犯罪行为是在行为地点发生的”。一九一七年巴西最高联邦法院对类似的案件也做了同样的判决。这些例子说明，无论后果是在那里发生的，犯罪地点是香港，因此和香港英国当局的责任是分不开的。英国照会诿称，坠毁不是发生在英国的领土或领海内，因此对事件的原因进行正式调查“并不是女王政府的事”。这种说法是完全不能成立的。
    香港英国当局对于在香港发生的一切事件无论如何负有事先防止和事后惩办的责任。但在这两点上，香港英国当局做得很不够，尤其在事后惩办方面简直是完全没有做，因此它在这一事件上负有重大的责任。
    按照国际法，香港英国当局本应当对各种情况予以“适当的注意”。一位美国著名国际法学家伊格尔顿在所著“国际法上的国家责任”一书中指出：“如果警告是及时提出，可以有时间采取适当的预防措施；如果危险是彰明昭著的和时常发生的；或者如果有某些特别情况必须加以特别注意的，那么，显然，所需要的注意程度应依此加以衡量。”同样，英国国际法学家霍尔在其“国际法”一书中指出：“如果这些行为是公开不讳的或是众所周知的，而如果它们是相当重要的，那么，显然，国家对于没有使用正当手段加以镇压，是负有责任的。”
    这些学者的意见是有许多国际先例加以支持的。一八八七年有一个美国人在墨西哥被强盗所杀，美国国务卿布连于一八九一年一月五日发给美国驻墨西哥代办窦格蒂的指示说：“对联邦和州当局都已发出了最充分的通知，告诉它们犯这次罪行的人们的非法行为……受到危险的人也一再向这些当局发出最紧急的呼吁，但这些当局并没有采取严重步骤来保护他们。”因此美国认为墨西哥应当对美侨的损失负责。
    一九三四年十月九日，南斯拉夫国王亚力山大和法国外交部长巴都在法国马赛遇刺身死，这些行刺的恐怖分子据说原先是在匈牙利活动的法西斯匪徒。十二月十日国际联盟行政院通过决议称：“每一个国家都有义务不去鼓励或容忍在其领土内进行任何具有政治目的的恐怖活动。每一国家必须尽其力之所能阻止和镇压这种性质的行为，并必须为此目的协助所有要求协助的政府。”决议认为某些匈牙利当局“至少由于失察而对于与这次罪行的准备有关的行为负有某种责任”，而且“匈牙利政府有责任……于它的任何当局的罪责确立时立即采取惩罚行动。”
    在国际常设裁判法庭判决的一件著名案件“荷花号”案（一九二七年）中，美国的慕尔法官宣称：
  “一个国家有义务使用适当注意以防止在其领域内发生对其他国家或其人民的犯罪行为，这是公认的原则。”
    这些国际法的原则和国际先例，毫无疑问地指明了香港英国当局对美蒋特务暗杀事件负有严重的责任。
    首先，我国政府关于美蒋特务的破坏阴谋对英国当局提出的警告不能说不是及时的。香港英国当局有足足二十四小时的时间来采取预防措施。其次，美蒋特务的暗害阴谋不能说不是彰明昭著的。谁不知道自从中国大陆解放以来香港一直是美蒋特务的巢穴？美国驻香港领事馆拥有三百多个工作人员所干何事？美国中央情报局掌握下的蒋匪间谍组织
  “自由中国运动”以“远东垦业公司”为名在香港征募了数千人又所干何事？难道香港英国当局不比任何别人知道得更清楚吗？一九四九年杨杰将军的被刺、以及开往天津的英国商船“泽生号”的被炸沉、一九五○年我国七架飞机在启德机场的被炸、同年我轮船“海厦”号的被炸、以及五艘起义渔轮在光天化日之下被蒋匪特务劫持，这些特务横行的事实难道已完全为香港英国当局所忘怀？甚至连美国合众社都不能不承认，在香港启德飞机场的工作人员有一部分是属于所谓“反共”的工会的，实际上也就是特务分子所控制的“工会”。那么事情是很清楚的，鉴于这些众所周知的事实，即使没有我方事前发出及时的警告，香港英国当局也应该对于美蒋特务的可能破坏活动采取最完善的预防措施。英方推说我方所提出的警告不够“详尽”，难道英方认为我们必须具体举出特务姓名和他们所要采取的破坏方法，并且就防止这种破坏的措施对香港警察当局发出指示吗？如果是这样，这将是承认英国当局已没有能力维持香港的治安和保护过往旅客了。
    实际上，香港英国当局的责任由于另外一个情况而加重了。这个情况就是这些搭乘“克什米尔公主号”飞机的旅客不是普通的旅客，而是中国政府出席一个国际会议的代表团的人员。国际法承认外交人员应受特别保护。奥本海说：“对外交官的保护，不但表现在为防止触犯所应加的必要警察措施上，而且也表现在对触犯者的特别严厉的惩罚上。”同样，国联法学家委员会关于意大利特里尼将军在希腊被杀事件所提出的报告也说：“外国人的被承认的公务身份以及他在一国领土上出现的情况，使得该国家负有相应的义务，要特别加以警卫。”而香港英国当局即使经警告之后对我国出席亚非会议的代表团人员所采取的保护措施是什么呢？它仅仅对飞机进行一般警戒，其目的仅仅是“保证这一行人不致在机场受到骚扰”而已。这种措施决不能说是已经尽了和当时情况的严重性相适应的“适当注意”。
    从香港英国当局事后对于缉拿凶手、惩办罪犯所采取的态度来看，也很难认为它已充分认识到它所负的责任的严重性。这种态度绝不能表明它已克尽了友好国家间应尽的义务。香港美蒋特务麇集，一直构成对中华人民共和国安全的严重威胁。作为一个友好国家，英国政府根据上述国际法原则和先例，早就应该尽其所能对于这些特务加以制裁和镇压。现在美蒋特务又一次以香港为基地对我国的外交人员进行了血腥的谋杀，这是令人忍无可忍的，而英国当局却还替这些特务百般掩饰，到底何所居心？英国政府企图以爆炸是发生在英国领土和领水以外为借口来推卸它的调查责任。但是这次犯罪行为既然是在香港发生和完成的，调查只须也只有在香港进行。要想把事情查得水落石出，只要认真审讯那些在香港以公开或半公开姿态出现的美蒋特务就行了。然而香港英国当局不但没有这样做，反而花更多的时间无理传讯我方人员和属于进步工会的人员，这充分表现出它是故意庇护和放纵真正的杀人犯。从香港英国当局事后对于惩办凶手所持的态度看来，也可以显然看出它没有克尽它在国际法上所应尽的义务，因此这也加重了它对这事件所负的责任。
    英国当局要想用狡辩抵赖的方法来诿卸它的严重责任是办不到的。唯有认真采取严峻措施，彻查匿居香港的美蒋特务组织，从对它们的严密审讯当中追究主谋的和直接参加行动的凶手，依法加以严办，才能减轻英国当局在这事件上所应负的严重责任。中国人民要求这样办，国际法和国际正义也要求这样办。
