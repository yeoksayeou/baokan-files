Exposing the Disguise of American Colonialism
    Cui Qi
    The Asian-African Conference of great historical significance is about to be held. Representatives of Asian and African countries will gather to discuss issues of common interest in order to enhance friendship and cooperation between countries. The awakening of the people in the vast Asian and African regions, reflected in the convening of this conference, has made American imperialism panic, and it is using the most despicable means to try to undermine the conference. At the same time, the United States Information Service and other propaganda machines are spreading hypocritical remarks to whitewash American colonialism. They say that America's "friendship" with the Asian people seems to be very long-standing: as early as the "turn of the century," the United States announced the "Open Door Policy" to "preserve China's territorial integrity." They also say that during and after World War II, the United States also "consistently supported other Asian independence movements" and "provided economic, technical, and military assistance." The American propaganda machine thus wants to portray itself as a warrior helping the Asian people against "old-style colonialism."
    However, history tells us that the United States began its colonial expansion into Asia as early as the 19th century. Every page of Asian history over the past century has recorded the aggressive activities of American colonialists. Professor Tyler Dennett wrote in his book "America in the New Pacific": "America participated in the eastward expansion of Europe from the beginning... It had a stake in the Far East even before it became a strong power."
    In the late nineteenth century, the United States, being busy with the war against Spain and consolidating its rule over its newly acquired colony of the Philippines, did not have time to participate in the competition among other colonial powers in dividing spheres of influence in China. Under these circumstances, American colonialists began to sing the praises of "Open Door," demanding a share of the colonial interests in China, and attempting to first use economic penetration to massively enter the Chinese market, in order to gradually seize hegemony in China and Asia. The proponent of this policy, U.S. Secretary of State John Hay, himself admitted that the purpose of the "Open Door" was to "seek the expansion of our commercial interests." American political commentator George Marion wrote very clearly in "Bases and Empire": "'Open Door' is primarily the American demand to share a piece of the pie in the already divided Chinese territory. Because we have no excuse, we use this moralized term."
    It can be seen that this so-called "Open Door Policy" actually aimed at expanding colonial power, and it had nothing in common with "preserving China's territorial integrity." The historical fact is that in the second year after the U.S. government announced the "Open Door Policy," the United States participated in the Eight-Power Allied Forces' armed invasion of China. The American consul in Beijing, Conger, and the American army played the most active role in instigating and advancing this invasion. It was only because of the Chinese people's angry opposition to the giant wave of imperialist aggression that imperialism did not dare to partition China. As Professor Tyler Dennett said: "It was the Chinese themselves, not the Americans, who prevented the partition of China. The Boxer Rebellion forced the Western countries to unite to jointly extinguish this anti-imperialist trend." ("America in the New Pacific")
    The United States Information Service's other "earliest action to support Asian countries' independence" was none other than the bloody conquest of the Philippines by the United States in the late 19th century. At that time, in order to seize the Philippines from another colonial country, Spain, the United States encouraged the Philippine people to fight against the Spanish colonialists in the name of helping the Philippines "independence." The Spaniards were driven away, but the American colonialists took their place. When the Philippine people wanted to establish their own independent country, the United States sent 140,000 troops to carry out a massacre of the Philippine people, strangling the Philippine independence movement in a pool of blood. The American colonialist General Smith ordered his soldiers: "The more ferocious the burning and killing, the better, kill everyone over the age of ten!" This is how the "support" given by the United States to the Philippine people's demand for independence began! This atrocity is something the Philippine people will never forget, and it is also something that honest Americans are ashamed of. At the time, Mark Twain wrote: America "is robbing under a flag that even bandits of old would not dare to use... The whole world is watching us with contempt."
    Since 1898, the United States maintained colonial rule in the Philippines for nearly half a century. In 1946, in the face of the rising tide of national independence movements throughout Southeast Asia after the war, the United States announced the "independence" of the Philippines. Thus, on the land of the Philippines, according to the United States Information Service, the American flag was lowered. However, regarding this "independence," "Business Week" wrote: "In the eyes of many Filipinos, independence is simply a dream... The Philippines' dependence on the United States is even greater than that of any state in the United States on the entire United States, and it is difficult for Filipinos to utilize their newly regained independence." Philippine Senator Jose Laurel also said on August 24, 1954, that the US-Philippine economic relationship "is a shame to the Filipinos and also an indecent thing to the Americans themselves." This is the true assessment of the "independence" given by the United States to the Philippines.
    Speaking of the United States' "support for other Asian independence movements," the United States Information Service actually cited American activities in Indonesia as an example. But who doesn't know that since the war, whenever the development of the national independence movement in Indonesia has threatened the foundations of imperialist colonial power, the United States has always come out to defend the interests of colonialism, while attempting to replace the Dutch colonialists in Indonesia. The Renville Agreement, which the United States helped formulate, was beneficial to the Dutch colonialists, and it openly opposed the Indonesian people's national demands for West Irian. Because of its hostility to the independent policies implemented by the Indonesian Republic government, the United States has constantly organized conspiracies to oppose and split the Indonesian Republic. Recently revealed facts prove that the United States has even attempted to subvert the Indonesian government by plotting coups and supplying weapons and materials to rebel groups.
    It can be seen from this that the so-called "independence" in the mouths of American colonialists has at least three important meanings: When a colonial country is under the rule of other colonial countries, the United States uses the name of "helping independence" to exclude the original colonialists and seize it for itself. When its own colony can no longer be ruled in the original way, the United States uses the name of "granting independence" to maintain its colonial rule in disguise. When a colonial country truly embarks on the road of national independence, the United States uses the name of "supporting independence" to conspire to subvert the country, so as to turn it back into a colony.
    As for the so-called "aid" from the United States, it is even more the vanguard of American colonialism. The United States uses various forms of "aid" to export surplus goods, export capital, compete for sales markets and raw material producing areas, and recruit cannon fodder to serve its ambition of dominating the world. Whoever accepts "US aid" must open up its land, sky, sea, resources, markets, manpower, and sovereignty to American monopoly capital and American colonialists. As a result, the entire country becomes a colony of the United States. Indian economist Suresh Rampur said that accepting "US aid" is "giving the United States a golden opportunity to strangle these countries." Japanese economics professor Yoshio Kobayashi also pointed out at the Asian countries conference that "the price that countries receiving this kind of assistance from the United States must pay for the little they receive is the loss of their country's political and economic independence."
    The matter is very clear: the United States says it opposes "old-style colonialism," but in reality, it is the most ferocious and insidious colonialist.
    The people of Asia suffered long-term colonial rule by imperialism in the past. The concept of independence is sacred in their minds. They have had painful experiences and glorious victories in their struggle for independence. Now, they will no longer be deceived, enslaved, and manipulated by imperialism. The people of all Asian countries are struggling for and defending their national independence, and this historical trend cannot be stopped by any reactionary force. Any disguise of the American colonialists is futile. Recently, at the mass rally in Delhi celebrating the closing of the Asian Countries Conference, a cry rang out: "Shame on American imperialism!" - This is a resounding answer from the Asian people to the American colonialists who are trying to whitewash themselves.

    揭穿美国殖民主义的伪装
    崔奇
    具有重大历史意义的亚非会议就要召开了。亚非国家的代表们将在一起讨论有关共同利益的问题，以增进各国之间的友好和合作。召开这一会议所反映的亚非广大地区人民的觉醒，使得美国帝国主义惊惶不安，它正使用最卑鄙的手段想要破坏这个会议。同时，美国新闻处和其他宣传机器又散布伪善的言论来粉饰美国的殖民主义。它们说，美国对亚洲人民的“友谊”似乎是很悠久了：还在“世纪之交”，美国就宣布了“中国门户开放政策”，
  “保全了中国领土完整”。它们还说，第二次世界大战期间和以后，美国也“一贯支持亚洲其他独立运动”，而且“给予经济、技术和军事援助”。美国的宣传机器就这样想把自己描写成为帮助亚洲人民反对“旧式殖民主义”的勇士的模样。
    但是，历史告诉我们，还在十九世纪，美国就开始向亚洲进行殖民扩张了。百年以来的每一页亚洲历史，都记载着美国殖民主义者的侵略活动。美国戴德华教授在“新太平洋中的美国”一书中就写过：“美国在一开始就参加了欧洲的向东扩张。……它在未成强国之前即已问鼎远东了。”
    十九世纪末叶，美国由于忙于对西班牙的战争和巩固它在新取得的菲律宾殖民地的统治，没有来得及参加其他殖民国家在中国划分势力范围的竞争。在这种情况之下，美国殖民主义者就高唱起“门户开放”，要求分沾在中国的殖民利益，并企图首先利用经济渗透的方法，大规模地打进中国的市场，以便逐步地争夺中国以及亚洲的霸权。这个政策的倡导者——美国国务卿海约翰自己就承认过：“门户开放”的目的在于“求我商业上利益之扩张”。美国政论家乔治·马立昂在“基地与帝国”一书中写得很清楚：“‘门户开放’最主要的是美国要求在这已分割的中国领土上分享一份权利。因为我们无可借口，所以就借用了这个道义化的名词。”
    可见，这种所谓“门户开放政策”实际上是以扩张殖民势力为其目的的，它和“保全中国领土完整”毫无共同之处。历史的事实是，在美国政府宣布“门户开放政策”的第二年，美国就参加了武装侵略中国的八国联军。美国当时驻华的北京领事康格和美国军队在挑起和推进这次侵略事件中起了最积极的作用。仅仅是因为中国人民愤怒的反对帝国主义侵略的巨潮，才使得帝国主义没有敢于对中国实行瓜分。正如戴德华教授所说：“阻止中国被瓜分的是中国人自己，而非美国人。义和团事变迫使西方各国不得不联合起来共同扑灭这个反帝风潮。”（“新太平洋中的美国”）
    美国新闻处所举出来的美国另一个“支持亚洲国家独立的最早行动”不是别的，那就是在十九世纪末美国对菲律宾的血腥的征伐。当时，美国为了从另一个殖民国家西班牙的手中夺取菲律宾，就以帮助菲律宾“独立”为名，鼓励菲律宾人民对西班牙殖民者作战。西班牙人被赶走了，美国殖民者却代替了它的地位。当菲律宾人民要建立自己的独立国家的时候，美国派遣了十四万军队，对菲律宾人民实行了大屠杀，把菲律宾的独立运动绞杀于血泊之中。美国殖民者的将军斯密士向士兵下命令：“烧杀愈猛愈妙，把十岁以上的人全部杀光！”美国给予菲律宾人民的独立要求的“支持”就是这样开始的！这个暴行是菲律宾人民所永远不能忘记的，也是正直的美国人所感到羞耻的。当时，马克·吐温写道：美国“打着昔日盗匪所不敢用的旗帜去进行抢劫。……全世界都以轻蔑的眼光注视我们。”
    自一八九八年以后，美国在菲律宾维持了将近半个世纪的殖民统治。到了一九四六年，在战后整个东南亚的民族独立运动高涨的情况下，美国宣布了菲律宾的“独立”。于是，在菲律宾的土地上，照美国新闻处的说法，美国国旗是落下去了。但是，对于这种“独立”，美国“商业周刊”曾写道：“在许多菲律宾人看来，独立简直是梦想…菲律宾之依赖于美国，较美国任何一州之依赖整个美国为甚，菲律宾人殆难利用其重新获得的独立地位。”菲律宾参议员何瑟·劳雷尔在一九五四年八月二十四日也说过，美菲经济关系“对菲律宾人是一个耻辱，而且对美国人自己也是一个不体面的事。”这就是对美国给予菲律宾的“独立”的真实估价。
    谈到美国“支持亚洲其他独立运动”，美国新闻处居然举出美国在印度尼西亚的活动作为例证。但谁不知道，战后以来美国每当印度尼西亚的民族独立运动的发展威胁到帝国主义殖民势力的根基时，总是出来维护殖民主义的利益，同时企图取代荷兰殖民者在印度尼西亚的地位。美国帮助制定的伦维尔协定就是对荷兰殖民者有利的，它并公开反对印度尼西亚人民对于西伊里安的民族要求。美国由于敌视印度尼西亚共和国政府所实行的独立政策，更不断地组织反对和分裂印度尼西亚共和国的阴谋活动。最近揭发出来的事实证明，美国甚至用阴谋策动政变和以武器及物资供应叛乱集团等方法，企图颠覆印度尼西亚政府。
    由此可见，美国殖民主义者口中的所谓“独立”，至少有着这样三种重要的含义：当某一个殖民地国家处于其他殖民国家统治之下时，美国就以“帮助独立”为名，排挤原来的殖民者，把它攫为己有。当美国自己的殖民地不能再按照原来的方式统治下去时，美国就以“给予独立”为名，来变相维持它的殖民统治。当某一个殖民地真正走上民族独立的道路时，美国就又以“支持独立”为名，阴谋颠覆这个国家，以便把它重新变为殖民地。
    至于美国的所谓“援助”，更是美国殖民主义的先锋。美国利用各种各样的“援助”，来输出剩余商品，输出资本，争夺销售市场和原料产地，并搜罗炮灰，以服务于它独霸世界的野心。谁接受“美援”，谁就要把它的土地、天空、海洋、资源、市场、人力和主权，统统向美国垄断资本开放，向美国殖民者开放，其结果是整个国家都变为美国的殖民地。印度经济学家苏勒什·兰布说，接受“美援”，就是“给美国千载难逢的机会来扼住这些国家的咽喉”。日本经济学教授小林义雄在亚洲国家会议上也指出，“得到美国这种援助的国家为它们所得到的不多的东西而必须付出的代价是，丧失本国的政治和经济独立。”
    事情是再清楚不过了：美国说它是反对“旧式殖民主义”的，但实际上它正是最凶恶、最阴谋的殖民主义者。
    亚洲人民过去遭受帝国主义的长期殖民统治。独立这个概念在他们心目中是神圣的。他们为了争取独立有过痛苦的经验，也有过光辉的胜利。现在，他们再不受帝国主义的欺骗、奴役和摆布了。亚洲各国人民都在为争取和维护自己的民族独立而斗争，这个历史潮流是任何反动力量所不能阻挡的。美国殖民主义者的任何伪装都是徒劳的。最近，在德里市举行的庆祝亚洲国家会议闭幕的群众大会上，响起了一片呼声：“美帝国主义可耻！”——这就是亚洲人民对于力图粉饰自己的美国殖民主义者的一个响亮回答。
