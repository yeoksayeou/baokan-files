Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 31st. The National Congress for the Restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations was held in Tokyo on the afternoon of March 30th. Approximately three thousand representatives from all walks of life in Japan participated in the congress.

    Domnitsky, head of the Soviet delegation in Tokyo, and Spandaryan, deputy representative of the Soviet Union to the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, also attended the congress.

    The congress passed resolutions on promoting economic and cultural exchanges between Japan and China and the Soviet Union, supporting the convening of the Asian-African Conference, and welcoming the visit of the Chinese trade delegation to Japan. The congress also passed a declaration and a letter of request to the Japanese government and Diet, pointing out the necessity of restoring normal relations between Japan and China and the Soviet Union, and its significance for Asian peace.

    Many representatives delivered speeches at the meeting, expressing the desire of people from all walks of life in Japan to restore normal relations with China and the Soviet Union and strive for peace and independence.

    Kyuhei Fusanosuke, chairman of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations, pointed out: Ten years have passed since the end of the war, and Japan has not yet become a completely independent country. Foreign troops are still stationed in Japan, and the Japanese economy still relies on foreign countries, which is very shameful. In order to change this situation, it is necessary to rebuild the national economy and develop foreign trade. However, we have not yet restored diplomatic relations with neighboring Soviet Union and China. Under these circumstances, it is impossible to expect the reconstruction of the national economy.

    Matsumoto Jiichiro, chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association, said: Today's meeting is a pledge meeting. Due to the unequal treaties signed with the United States, our 85 million compatriots are in a state of enslavement, and these treaties should be abolished. He said: Establishing diplomatic relations with China will help world peace.

    Ooyama Ikuo, a prominent Japanese public figure, said: Because the Japanese people strongly demand the restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and China, the Hatoyama Cabinet has had to express its willingness to take this as one of the government's policies. He said that the Japanese people's welcome to the Chinese Red Cross delegation and the Chinese trade delegation fully demonstrated this desire. This is something that no force can stop.

    Sata Tadataka, representative of the Left-wing Socialist Party, pointed out that a few years ago, the demand for the restoration of Japan-Soviet and Japan-China diplomatic relations was only the advocacy of a few people, but now it has become the demand of the entire Japanese nation. He said that Japan should demand independence and autonomy. In order to achieve this goal, we must have the courage to overcome difficulties.

    Hori Makoto, representative of the Labor-Farmer Party, said: The demand for the restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and China is a unanimous voice from all walks of life in Japan. Japan should strive to establish an independent economy and get rid of its subordination to the United States.

    Miyamoto Kenji, representative of the Japanese Communist Party, said: The convening of this congress is of historical significance. The Japanese people can unite and open the way to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and China.

    Nakamura Koichi, representative of the Right-wing Socialist Party, Ikeda Masanosuke, representative of the Democratic Party, Hiratsuka Tsunejiro, representative of the fishing industry, and others also expressed in their speeches their hope that Japan could restore normal relations with China and the Soviet Union as soon as possible, promote economic and cultural exchanges between each other, and pointed out the difficulties that the Japanese economy has encountered due to not establishing normal relations with China and the Soviet Union.

    Spandaryan said at the meeting: The Soviet Union hopes to coexist peacefully with all countries, regardless of their social systems. He emphasized that the efforts made by the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations in restoring normal relations between Japan and China and the Soviet Union are fully supported by the Soviet people. He hoped that the normalization of relations between Japan and the Soviet Union would be realized soon.

    The congress concluded with a performance of Chinese songs and dances and the screening of Soviet films.

    日本恢复日中日苏邦交全国大会在东京举行
    大会通过促进日本同中苏两国的经济和文化交流等决议
    并通过宣言以及致日本政府和国会的要求书
    新华社东京三十一日电　日本恢复日中、日苏邦交全国大会于三月三十日下午在东京举行。参加大会的有日本全国各界的代表约三千人。
    苏联驻东京代表团团长多穆尼茨基和苏联出席联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会会议副代表斯潘达里扬等也出席了大会。
    大会通过了促进日本同中苏两国的经济和文化交流，拥护亚非会议的召开和欢迎中国贸易代表团访问日本等项决议。大会并通过了宣言以及致日本政府和国会的要求书，指出恢复日本同中、苏两国的正常关系的必要性和对于亚洲和平的意义。
    许多代表在会上发表的演说，表明了日本各阶层人士要求恢复同中苏的正常关系和争取和平独立的愿望。
    恢复日中、日苏邦交国民会议会长久原房之助指出：战争结束已经十年，日本还没有成为一个完全独立的国家。外国的军队还驻在日本，日本经济还依靠外国，这是很丢脸的。为了改变这种状态，必须重建国家的经济，发展对外贸易。但是，我们还没有和邻近的苏联、中国恢复邦交，在这种情况下，要指望重建国家经济是不可能的。
    日中友好协会会长松本治一郎说：今天的大会是一个宣誓大会。由于和美国签订的不平等条约，我们八千五百万同胞处在被奴役的状态下，这些条约应该废除。他说：和中国建立邦交，将有助于世界和平。
    日本著名公众领袖大山郁夫说：由于日本人民强烈地要求同苏联、中国恢复邦交，鸠山内阁不得不表示愿以这作为政府的政策之一。他说，日本人民对中国红十字会代表团和中国贸易代表团的欢迎，充分表现了这种愿望。这是任何力量也不能阻挠的。
    左派社会党代表佐多忠隆指出，几年前，要求恢复日苏、日中邦交还只是少数人的主张，而现在已经成为日本全体国民的要求了。他说，日本应要求独立自主。为了达到这个目的，我们要拿出勇气来克服困难。
    劳农党代表堀真琴说：要求恢复同苏联和中国的邦交是日本各阶层一致的声音。日本应该争取建立自主的经济，摆脱隶属美国的状态。
    日本共产党代表宫本显治说：这个大会的召开是有历史意义的。日本人民团结一致就能打开同苏联和中国建立邦交的道路。
    右派社会党代表中村高一、民主党代表池田正之辅、渔业界代表平塚常次郎等在他们的演说里，也表示希望日本能早日恢复和中、苏两国的正常关系，促进彼此之间的经济和文化交流，并且指出日本经济由于没有和中、苏建立正常关系所遭到的困难。
    斯潘达里扬在会上讲话说：苏联希望和一切国家和平共处，不论它们的社会制度怎样。他强调说：恢复日中、日苏邦交国民会议在恢复日本和中苏两国的正常关系上所作的努力，受到苏联人民的完全支持。他希望日苏两国关系正常化早日实现。
    大会最后表演了中国歌舞，并放映了苏联电影。
