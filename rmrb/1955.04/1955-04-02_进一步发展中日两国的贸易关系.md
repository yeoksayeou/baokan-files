Editorial

    The Chinese trade delegation to Japan, invited by the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and the League of Diet Members for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade, arrived in Tokyo on March 29. This visit to Japan by the Chinese trade delegation is of great significance. This is the first time a Chinese trade delegation has visited Japan. At the same time, after the sixth post-war general election at the end of February this year, the situation in Japan has changed, and the Hatoyama Cabinet has been formally established after the election.
    For a long time, due to the Japanese government's policy of following the United States, the people of China and Japan have not been able to interact normally, and Sino-Japanese trade has not been able to develop normally. Now, the results of the Japanese general election have made it possible to change this situation. The results of the election show that the Japanese people have become tired of the Yoshida government's policy of following the United States. Therefore, there is reason to expect that this visit by the Chinese trade delegation to Japan should be the beginning of further development of Sino-Japanese trade relations.
    China and Japan are geographically close, and the two countries have had close economic relations in history. After the war, under the occupation and control of the United States, Japan's foreign trade only recovered to 30% to 40% of the pre-war level, while its balance of payments often showed deficits. The Japanese economy, dependent on "US aid" and US military orders, is facing serious difficulties such as the abnormal development of industry, insufficient enterprise operation, overstocking of products, and high production costs, making it unable to compete in the international market. Japan's trade relations with Asian countries, especially with China, have been artificially hampered and blocked by the United States and the Yoshida Cabinet. Yoshida's policy of wanting "US aid" but not trade has caused great suffering to the Japanese people and caused great difficulties to the domestic economy of Japan.
    It was only through the joint efforts of the Chinese people and Japanese people who are enthusiastic about trading with China that the relevant non-governmental trade organizations of the two countries signed the first and second Sino-Japanese trade agreements in June 1952 and October 1953, respectively. Because the Yoshida Cabinet did not consider Japan's economic interests and hindered Sino-Japanese trade in various ways, the first Sino-Japanese trade agreement was actually only 5.05% implemented. The second Sino-Japanese trade agreement, although the implementation was improved due to the unremitting efforts of the relevant people of the two countries, only reached 38.8% of the total trade volume of the agreement. It should be pointed out that the implementation of the above two trade agreements is unsatisfactory. The reason why the two agreements could not be fully implemented is obviously because the former Japanese government adopted a policy of following the United States and was unwilling to assume its due responsibilities, thus making the implementation of the limited trade agreements between non-governmental organizations of China and Japan lose its guarantee. Shozo Murata, chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, is right to say that the obstacle to expanding Sino-Japanese trade lies on the Japanese side; therefore, the Japanese government must strive to eliminate the obstacles to trade with China.
    The US aggressive bloc is unwilling to see Japan develop trade with China and the Soviet Union, and is unwilling to see Japan have an independent and autonomous economy. It undermines Japan's peaceful coexistence and economic and cultural cooperation with Asian countries. US officials have expressed deep concern about the results of the Japanese general election, believing that the election "shows that Japan's independent sentiment is growing after the war." The United States is exerting pressure on Japan from all sides, attempting to influence the Japanese political situation and make the new Japanese cabinet retrace the old path of enslavement taken by the Yoshida government, which has been spurned by the Japanese people. US officials openly threatened the Japanese government and business community, attempting to prevent Japan from expanding trade relations with China. Stassen, director of the US Foreign Operations Administration, rushed to Japan after the Japanese general election to discuss "economic assistance" and Japan-US economic "cooperation," attempting to make the Japanese government continue to rely on "US aid." Stassen openly threatened Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama, saying: "The expansion of Japan's trade with communist countries will lead to political difficulties." According to a March 6 report in the Yomiuri Shimbun, "The United States is preparing to curb Japan's plan to expand trade with communist countries." "The US government may freeze the assets of Japanese companies that have branches in the United States if these companies send trade representatives to communist countries." The US ruling bloc, in the posture of a master, is carrying out shameless threats and intimidation against the Japanese government and people, attempting to obstruct the development of Sino-Japanese trade, hinder the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, and keep Japan under US control forever, becoming a tool of US aggression and war policy.
    The Japanese people are firmly opposed to this US policy of enslaving Japan. The Japanese people are determined to take the road of independence and autonomy, restore Japan's normal relations with its neighboring countries, especially with China and the Soviet Union, in order to further develop Japan's trade relations with these countries. Whether the new Japanese government, under this pressure and threat from the United States, can take the road of independence and autonomy will be a serious test for the new government itself.
    On March 24, Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu said in response to questions from members of the House of Representatives that promoting trade between Japan and China is the established policy of the Hatoyama government. At the same time, Shigemitsu also expressed his welcome to the Chinese trade delegation's visit to Japan.
    It should be pointed out that negotiations between the Chinese and Japanese trade representatives on the formulation of a new Sino-Japanese trade agreement are now beginning. If the Japanese government truly wants to realize the aforementioned established policy announced by Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, then such negotiations should have good results, and Sino-Japanese trade relations should be developed as they should be. If this is not the case, if the Japanese government adopts an attitude of indifference or even obstructs these negotiations from the sidelines, and continues to endure the restrictions and pressure from the United States, then even if Japanese semi-official trade organizations are willing to work to promote these trade negotiations, the development of Sino-Japanese trade will still be greatly limited. We believe that all Japanese people and Japanese social organizations who are willing to improve Sino-Japanese trade relations will not allow this practice to continue.

### 进一步发展中日两国的贸易关系

    进一步发展中日两国的贸易关系
    中国访日贸易代表团应日本国际贸易促进协会和日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟的邀请，已于三月二十九日抵达东京。中国贸易代表团这一次的访问日本是有重要意义的。因为这是中国贸易代表团第一次到日本去访问；同时，经过今年二月末的战后第六次大选，日本的情况已有了变化，大选后鸠山内阁已正式成立。
    长时期来，由于日本政府执行了追随美国的政策，中日两国人民不能正常地往来，中日贸易不能正常地发展。现在，日本大选的结果使改变这种状况有了可能。大选的结果表明日本人民已经厌弃了吉田政府追随美国的政策。因此有理由期待，这次中国贸易代表团的访问日本应当是进一步发展中日贸易关系的开始。
    中国和日本地理邻近，两国在历史上曾有过密切的经济关系。战后，在美国的占领和控制下，日本对外贸易只恢复到战前的百分之三十至四十，而国际收支却常常出现赤字。日本经济由于依附“美援”和美国军需订货，正面临着工业畸形发展、企业开工不足、产品积压、产品成本太高因而无力在国际市场上竞争的严重困难。日本同亚洲各国，特别是同中国的贸易关系，受到美国和吉田内阁的人为的刁难和阻塞。要“美援”不要贸易的吉田政策，给日本人民生活造成极大的痛苦，使日本国内经济发生莫大的困难。
    只是由于中国人民和热心对中国进行贸易的日本人士的共同努力，才使两国有关的民间贸易团体分别于一九五二年六月和一九五三年十月签订了第一次和第二次中日贸易协议。因为吉田内阁不为日本经济利益着想，对中日贸易进行种种阻挠，因此第一次中日贸易协议实际上只执行了百分之五点零五。第二次中日贸易协议，虽然由于两国有关人士的不懈努力，执行情况有所改进，但也只达到了协议的贸易总额的百分之三十八点八。应该指出：上述两次贸易协议的执行情况都是不能令人满意的。两次协议之所以不能充分执行，显然是因为前日本政府采取了追随美国的政策，不愿意承担它应该承担的责任，从而使中日两国民间团体的有限的贸易协定的执行也失去了保障。日本国际贸易促进协会会长村田省藏说得对，扩大中日贸易的障碍是在日本这方面；因此，日本政府必须努力消除同中国贸易的障碍。
    美国侵略集团不愿意看到日本发展对中苏两国的贸易，不愿意看到日本有独立自主的经济。它破坏日本同亚洲国家的和平共处和经济文化上的合作关系。美国官员对于日本大选的结果表示了深切的忧虑，认为大选“表明了战后日本的独立情绪正在增长”。美国正在从各方面向日本施加压力，企图影响日本政局，使日本新内阁重走被日本人民唾弃了的吉田政府所走的被奴役的老路。美国负责官员公开恫吓日本政府和经济界，企图阻止日本和中国扩大贸易往来。美国援外事务管理署署长史塔生在日本大选之后，急忙赶到日本活动，商谈“经济援助”、日美经济“合作”，企图使日本政府继续依附“美援”。史塔生公开威胁日本首相鸠山一郎说：“日本和共产党国家的贸易扩充将导致政治上的困难。”据读卖新闻三月六日报道：“美国正在准备箝制日本扩大同共产党国家的贸易计划。”“美国政府可能冻结在美国设有分公司的日本公司的财产，如果这些公司派贸易代表去共产党国家的话。”美国统治集团俨然以主子的姿态，对日本政府和人民进行无耻的威胁和恫吓，企图阻挠中日贸易的发展，妨害中日关系的正常化，使日本永远处于美国控制之下，成为美国侵略和战争政策的一个工具。
    日本人民是坚决反对美国这种奴役日本的政策的。日本人民坚决要求走独立自主的道路，恢复日本同它的近邻各国，特别是同中、苏两国的正常关系，以进一步发展日本同这些国家的贸易关系。日本新政府，在美国这种压力和威胁之下，是否能够走独立自主的道路，将是对新政府本身的一个严重考验。
    三月二十四日，日本外相重光葵在日本众议院回答议员质询时说：促进日本和中国的贸易是鸠山政府的既定政策。同时重光又表示欢迎中国贸易代表团访问日本。
    应当指出：目前中日贸易代表关于商订新的中日贸易协议的商谈正在开始。如果日本政府真正要实现重光外相所宣布的上述既定政策，那么，这种商谈就应该有良好的结果，中日贸易关系就会得到应有的发展。如果不是这样，如果日本政府对于这次商谈采取漠不关心或甚至从旁阻挠的态度，继续忍受美国的牵制和压力，那么，即使日本半官方性的贸易团体愿意为推进这次贸易商谈而努力，中日贸易的发展仍然会受到很多的限制。我们相信，一切愿意改善中日贸易关系的日本人民和日本社会团体是不会听任这种做法继续下去的。
