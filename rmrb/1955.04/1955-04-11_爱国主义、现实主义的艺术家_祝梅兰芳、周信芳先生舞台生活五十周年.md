    Patriotic and Realistic Artists
    ——Celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the Stage Life of Mr. Mei Lanfang and Mr. Zhou Xinfang
    Ma Shaobo
    Mr. Mei Lanfang and Mr. Zhou Xinfang, the most outstanding performing artists of our time, have been engaged in theatrical work for a full fifty years. The Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Chinese Dramatists Association solemnly commemorate their remarkable achievements over the past fifty years. This further demonstrates the people's and the state's respect and love for artistic labor and artists who have contributed to the people's art. Both of them have rich and outstanding creations in the art of performing over the past fifty years. They are artists who love their motherland and their people.
    After the Japanese imperialists invaded Northeast China in 1931, Mr. Mei staged "Resisting the Jin Troops" and "Life and Death Regret" to inspire the people's anti-Japanese sentiments. During the period of enemy and puppet rule, he grew a beard to express his determination and resolutely refused to yield to the enemy, demonstrating his strong national integrity. After the "September 18th" Incident, when the bandit Chiang Kai-shek adopted a policy of non-resistance, Mr. Zhou Xinfang wrote and performed plays such as "Hong Chengchou" to inspire popular morale; after the "July 7th" Resistance War, he organized a troupe in Shanghai and performed his self-written Peking operas "Emperors Hui and Qin," "Fragrant Concubine's Regret," "Dong Xiaowan," "Regret for the Fall of Shu," "Wen Tianxiang," etc. for a long time to arouse national integrity and encourage patriotic enthusiasm.
    After the national liberation, both Mr. Mei and Mr. Zhou were respected by the state and the people. They were invited to attend the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and were elected as representatives to the National People's Congress. Both Mr. Mei and Mr. Zhou assumed leadership positions in national opera research institutions and theaters. They implemented the literary and art policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the opera reform policy, and spared no effort in participating in the socialist construction of the motherland and the peaceful and democratic cause of the people of the world. Although they are both in their sixties, their work, study, and life are full of vigor. In recent years, in order to satisfy the people's desire, they have traveled to various places to perform, especially wholeheartedly performing in comfort tours to North Korea and to comfort the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and have been warmly welcomed everywhere.
    In their long-term artistic practice, they have inherited and developed the realistic tradition of opera art through a difficult and tortuous path. They brought the art of performing to a realm of truthfulness, movingness, and beauty.
    They have created rich and unforgettable artistic images in their half-century of stage life. The profoundness and lastingness of the influence of artistic images on the audience depend on the depth of the moving power of the artistic images created by the actors through the art of performance. The reason why every artistic image embodied on the stage has weight lies in the fact that the image should have such an inherent capacity: the vividness and truthfulness of the characters can reach a prominent and fulfilling degree, so that it not only attracts and moves the audience at the time, but also for a long time, its ideological power is still retained in the audience's consciousness, helping to cultivate the people's moral character and enriching the people's spiritual life. The reason why Mr. Mei and Mr. Zhou have reached such a high level is because they truly understand that they must create artistic images and how to create artistic images, and truly understand that the creation of artistic images must start from the truthfulness of the characters' thoughts and character; it is necessary to accurately grasp the characteristics of historical conditions and the characters' living environment. They have not only made continuous and great efforts in understanding the characters' thoughts and feelings and transforming themselves into the characters in the play; but also they understand that since they are artists, creators of living images, they should have real skills and be proficient in their means of expression. They have undergone long-term and rigorous training in this regard. Whether it is "singing, acting, reciting, or fighting," they laid a solid foundation in their youth. For fifty years, they have always combined skills with expressing the characters' thoughts and feelings, diligently and tirelessly practicing, and always organically unified the characters' thoughts and performance skills. They pay great attention to studying the content, phonology, and rhythm of the lyrics and recitations, studying the clarity and correctness of pronunciation and articulation, and studying the vividness and beauty of postures, steps, and all dance movements. Therefore, when they shape roles, they are extremely good at accurately and flexibly using artistic skills to create living artistic images. When they use all "external techniques," every word and sentence, every move and style, is never singing for the sake of singing, or dancing for the sake of dancing, but has a deep inner connotation. When we look at Mr. Mei's "Drunken Concubine," "Farewell My Concubine"... through those rich dance postures, all subtly express the characters' melancholy and poignant feelings. He is best at expressing the most delicate emotions very clearly. When we look at Mr. Zhou's "Chasing Han Xin," "Four Scholars"... even if it is the recitation of "Han Xin is gone!" a back posture, and a horse-riding scene in Chasing Han, how prominent is Xiao He's eagerness to seek talent and his loyal and devoted mind! Even Song Shijie's trembling hand after being punished in the court powerfully conveys the character's inner anger; and when he recites "A godfather doesn't protect his goddaughter, then... who will protect her!" "Not much bribery, only three hundred taels!" that simple hand gesture is so strongly expressive of Song Shijie's spirit of righteousness, hatred of evil, and rebellious spirit in a way that is so consistent with the language!
    It is not difficult to understand why Mr. Mei created such vivid and beautiful artistic images in playing Zhao Yanrong ("Cosmic Peak"), Bai Suzhen ("Legend of the White Snake"), Han Yu娘 ("Life and Death Regret"), Lin Daiyu ("Burying Flowers"), Qingwen ("A Thousand Gold for a Smile"), Hua Mulan ("Mulan Joins the Army"), Xiao Guiying ("Killing the Family by the Fishing"), Liang Hongyu ("Resisting the Jin Troops"), Mu Guiying ("Spear Picking Mu Tianwang"), Xue Jinlian ("Sisters-in-law Heroes"), Xi Shi ("Xi Shi")... many different roles are so vivid and beautiful, making them unforgettable.
    It is not difficult to understand why Mr. Zhou created such magnificent, profound, and moving impressions on the audience in playing Xiao He ("Chasing Han Xin"), Song Shijie ("Four Scholars"), Zhang Guangcai ("Sweeping Pine"), Xiao En ("Killing the Family by the Fishing"), Song Jiang ("Xunyang Tower"), Zhang Yuanxiu ("Qingfeng Pavilion"), Lu Junyi ("Daming Prefecture"), Zhang Liang ("Bolang Hammer"), Yue Fei ("Wind and Waves Pavilion"), Yang Jiye ("Generals of the Yang Family"), Zou Yinglong ("Beating Yan Song"), Wen Tianxiang ("Wen Tianxiang")... many different roles.
    For the creation of actors, it is necessary to develop their independent artistic thinking according to the principles of realism, not sticking to conventions, not mechanically imitating the predecessors, but should be based on respecting the tradition to carry out independent creation. The artistic achievements of Mr. Mei and Mr. Zhou mainly promote the tradition, and show the spirit of daring to innovate and the perseverance of moving forward.
    In the late Qing Dynasty, Peking Opera's "singing, acting, reciting, and fighting" had their own specializations. The boundaries between Qingyi Dan, Comedy Dan, Boudoir Dan, Assassination Dan, Sword and Horse Dan, and Martial Dan were relatively strict. Each Dan line had its own preferences in terms of performance requirements. Although such a strict division of labor can give play to the technical expertise of various types of roles, it has serious limitations for completely and vividly creating characters and expressing emotions. Senior artists such as Mei Qiaoling, Yu Ziyun, Lu Sanbao, and Li Zishan have all made efforts to varying degrees to break this boundary. Mr. Wang Yaoqing further clarified that starting from the characters, he resolutely broke this limitation and began to boldly integrate the performance methods of Qingyi and Hua Dan according to different roles, and sometimes also included the techniques of Sword and Horse Dan. By Mr. Mei's time, he integrated them all, not only continuously processing and enriching the techniques of singing, acting, reciting, martial arts, and other dance movements in performance practice, but also further combining them organically and creatively according to the needs of character expression and the performance that comprehensive art should have. He also boldly carried out some improvements in the aspects of Dan's singing, costumes, and makeup. He selected dance materials from martial arts plays, from various dance postures of Dan roles, from other brotherly operas, and directly from life. Through costume plays such as "Celestial Maiden Spreading Flowers," "Chang'e Flying to the Moon," "Luo Shen," "Farewell My Concubine," "The True Story of Tai Zhen," "Magu Offering Longevity," and "Xi Shi," he made careful creations in strengthening the danceability of Peking Opera performance; and also tried to express contemporary life through fashion plays such as "Karma of the Sea of ​​Bitterness," "Deng Xiagu," and "A Ray of Hemp."
    Mr. Zhou has always been known for his courage to innovate in the Peking Opera world. His foundation in traditional art is deep, and his skills greatly help his performance; but the old format has never been able to limit his heartfelt, personalized performance creation. When he was young, some of the plays his teacher taught him, such as "Four Scholars," "Qingfeng Pavilion," and "Beating Yan Song"... the characters were not very prominent, or rather, not very vivid, but after his continuous deliberation and enrichment, the content of life was enriched. "The play" came out, and the people's nature was also highlighted. On the basis of Peking Opera tradition, he boldly absorbed the experience of local operas and modern art, and he was also good at dissolving them and using them freely and appropriately in his character creation. For example, he adapted many plays such as "Linjiang Post" and "Chasing Han Xin" from classical dramas. His "Qingfeng Pavilion" and "Killing the Family by the Fishing" were greatly influenced by Bangzi opera; "Sweeping Pine" and "Running the City" are the paths of Anhui opera. On the basis of the original tradition, Mr. Zhou has carried out innovations and enrichments in both the script and the performance.
    Undoubtedly, their spirit of innovation is supported and welcomed by the masses, but it is not smooth and unhindered. When Mr. Mei performed some new plays and made some new creations in his early years, he was opposed by many conservatives and scolded as "heretical demons." As for Mr. Zhou Xinfang's bold creations in art, at that time, they were even regarded by some people as "side doors and crooked ways." However, none of this stopped them. They finally overcame the difficulties and insisted on the correct development of art.
    For fifty years, both of them have attached great importance to the connection with the masses, and their spirit of being humble and eager to learn and tireless in teaching is moving. Their attitude towards art has always been serious. Until now, both of them are still constantly revising and enriching their scripts and performances, striving for perfection and unwilling to slack off.
    The artistic accomplishment and moral character of artists are always closely related to each other, and it is in this relationship that great art is produced. In the past, Mr. Mei and Mr. Zhou were naturally subjected to the cruel oppression of the three mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism without exception. The painful experiences of life and the influence of the people's revolutionary struggle for liberation gradually awakened them, and due to the influence of the people's excellent moral traditions and the ability to draw some positive spiritual power from realistic artistic creation, they cultivated their own moral character. In turn, they enriched the people's spiritual life through artistic creation. Therefore, although both of them lived in the old social environment in the past, they never led art to depravity, but strived to combine their art with patriotic and democratic ideas. After liberation, contact with the new era and new audiences—the vast number of workers, peasants, and soldiers—has added new life to their art. They and their art were just like branches growing tortuously and tenaciously under the rocks in the past. Now, the rocks have been lifted, stretching out into the free and vast world, making them even more prosperous and luxuriant.
    Comrade Zhou Yang once said in his summary report at the First National Opera Observation Conference:
        "The performing art of Chinese opera is outstanding; especially because Chinese opera integrates the arts of singing, dancing, and drama, it shows its extraordinary characteristics even more. Chinese opera, especially Peking Opera, has produced a series of talented performing artists from Cheng Changgeng to Mei Lanfang. They have created various different character personalities on the stage. Their performing art is an extremely important and valuable part of our entire opera heritage, and must be correctly inherited and developed." (December 27, 1952, "People's Daily")
    Such an evaluation is accurate; the Chinese people are proud to have such talented performing artists as Mr. Mei Lanfang and Mr. Zhou Xinfang. Their experience and achievements are particularly valuable. Their artistic path over the past fifty years is a realistic path, a patriotic path, and must be correctly inherited and developed. Today, when the motherland is carrying out socialist construction on a large scale, artists should more actively arm themselves with the theory of Marxism-Leninism, systematically and firmly establish a communist worldview and the creative principles of socialist realism, combine more closely with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and advance together with our new society and new era. Mr. Mei and Mr. Zhou are working hard to do this. Then, the future and prospects shown by the path they have taken will be infinitely broad and infinitely far-reaching. Let us respectfully wish Mr. Mei and Mr. Zhou eternal youth!
      Editor's Note: The Mei Lanfang Zhou Xinfang Stage Life 50th Anniversary Commemoration Meeting jointly held by the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Chinese Dramatists Association will be held in Beijing today.

    爱国主义、现实主义的艺术家
    ——祝梅兰芳、周信芳先生舞台生活五十周年
    马少波
    我国当代最优秀的表演艺术家梅兰芳、周信芳两位先生从事演剧劳动整整五十周年了。中华人民共和国文化部、中国文学艺术界联合会、中国戏剧家协会为他们两位五十年来的卓越成就隆重地举行纪念，是更进一步显示了人民和国家对于艺术劳动和对人民艺术事业有贡献的艺术家的重视和热爱。他们两位五十年来在演剧艺术上有丰富的杰出的创造。他们是爱祖国、爱人民的艺术家。
    当一九三一年日本帝国主义侵略东北以后，梅先生排演了“抗金兵”、“生死恨”等剧以激励人民的抗日情绪。敌伪统治时期，他蓄须明志，坚决不向敌人屈服，表现了坚强的民族气节。“九一八”事变，蒋贼采取不抵抗政策，周信芳先生曾编演了“洪承畴”等剧激励民气；“七七”抗战以后，他在上海组织剧团，长期贴演了自编京剧“徽钦二帝”、“香妃恨”、“董小宛”、“亡蜀恨”、“文天祥”等剧以激发民族气节，鼓舞爱国热情。
    全国解放以后，梅、周两位都受到了国家和人民的尊重，被邀出席中国人民政治协商会议，并被选为全国人民代表大会代表，梅、周两位都担负了国家戏曲研究机关和剧院的领导工作。他们执行为工农兵服务的文艺方针和戏曲改革政策，参加祖国社会主义建设事业和世界人民的和平民主事业，不遗余力。他们虽然都是六十岁的高龄了，但是无论工作、学习、生活都充满着蓬勃的朝气。最近几年来，他们为了满足群众的渴望，不辞辛苦地到各地演出，特别是全心全意地进行了赴朝慰问演出和慰问中国人民解放军的演出，到处受到热烈的欢迎。
    他们在自己长期的艺术实践中，经过艰难曲折的道路，继承和发扬了戏曲艺术的现实主义的传统。使表演艺术达到了真实动人和美的境界。
    他们在半个世纪的舞台生活中创造了丰富的令人难忘的艺术形象。艺术形象对观众发生影响的深刻性、持久性，决定于演员通过表演艺术所创造的艺术形象的感人力量的深度。每一个在舞台上体现出来的艺术形象之所以有分量，就在于形象应具有这样的内在的容量：人物的生动和真实，能够达到突出和充实的程度，它不仅使观众当时受到吸引和感动，而且很久很久，它的思想力量也还保留在观众的意识之中，帮助培养了人民的道德品质，丰富了人民的精神生活。梅、周两位之所以达到这样高的水准，是由于他们真正懂得必须创造艺术形象和怎样去创造艺术形象，真正懂得创造艺术形象必须从人物的思想、性格的真实性出发；必须确切掌握历史条件和人物生活环境的特点。他们不仅在体会人物的思想感情使自己化为剧中人的功夫上，曾经作了不断的极大的努力；而且他们懂得自己既然是艺术家，是活生生的形象的创造者，那就应当具有真正的技巧，精通自己的表现手段。他们在这方面经过了长期的严格的锻炼，无论是“唱、做、念、打”，远在少年时代，就打好了稳固的基础。五十年来，他们一直是在技巧上结合表现人物思想感情，持久不懈地勤修苦练，一直是把人物思想和表现技巧两者有机地统一起来。他们十分注意研究唱词念白的内容、音韵、节奏，研究发音吐字的清晰和正确，研究身段、步伐和一切舞蹈动作的生动优美。因而他们在塑造角色时极其善于精确地活用艺术技巧，创造出活生生的艺术形象。当他们运用一切“外部技术”的时候，一字一句，一招一式，绝不是为歌唱而歌唱，为舞蹈而舞蹈，而是具有深厚的内在的含蓄。我们看梅先生的“醉酒”、“别姬”……通过那些丰富的舞蹈身段，无不微妙地表现出人物的幽怨和凄恋的情感。他最善于把最细腻的感情表现得非常鲜明。我们看周先生的“追韩信”、“四进士”……那怕是念道：“韩信去了！”的一个背式，追韩的一场趟马，表现萧何求贤若渴忠心耿耿的胸怀，何等凸出！即使是宋士杰在公堂受刑后一只手颤动的动作，也有力地传达了人物内心的激愤；而当他念到“干父不保干女儿，那……一个来保！”“受贿不多，只有三百两！”的那末一个质朴的手式，又是多么和语言相应地强烈地表现出宋士杰这个老人见义勇为嫉恶如仇的品格和反抗的气魄！
    这就不难理解，为什么梅先生在扮演赵艳容
  （“宇宙锋”）、白素贞（“白蛇传”）、韩玉娘
  （“生死恨”）、林黛玉（“葬花”）、晴雯（“千金一笑”）、花木兰（“木兰从军”）、萧桂英（“打渔杀家”）、梁红玉（“抗金兵”）、穆桂英（“枪挑穆天王”）、薛金莲（“姑嫂英雄”）、西施（“西施”）……许多角色中所创造的各种不同的艺术形象那样生动优美，令人难以忘怀。
    这就不难理解，为什么周先生在扮演萧何（“追韩信”）、宋士杰（“四进士”）、张广才（“扫松”）、萧恩（“打渔杀家”）、宋江（“浔阳楼”）、张元秀（“清风亭”）、卢俊义（“大名府”）、张良（“博浪椎”）、岳飞（“风波亭”）、杨继业（“杨家将”）、邹应龙（“打严嵩”）、文天祥（“文天祥”）………许多角色中所创造的各种不同的艺术形象给观众留下那样大气磅礴的深刻动人的印象。
    对于演员的创造来说，又必须根据现实主义的原则来发展他的独立的艺术思维，不墨守成规，不机械地模拟前人，而应是在尊重传统的基础上进行独立的创造。梅、周两位艺术上的成就，主要是发扬了传统，表现了勇于革新的精神和前进不懈的毅力。
    满清末期，京剧旦角的“唱、做、念、打”各有专行，青衣旦、玩笑旦、闺门旦、刺杀旦、刀马旦、武旦等分界是较严的。各旦行在表演要求上各有所偏。这样严格的分工，虽然可以发挥各类角色技术上的专长，但对于完整地生动地创造人物，表达感情，有着严重的限制。前辈艺人如梅巧玲、余紫云、路三宝、李紫珊等为了打破这种界限，都曾经作了一定程度的努力。王瑶卿先生进一步明确从人物出发，坚决突破了这种限制，开始大胆地根据不同角色把青衣和花旦的表演方式融合起来，有时并兼收刀马旦的技巧。到梅先生，更集其大成，不但在表演实践中把唱、做、念白、武工的技术及其他舞蹈动作不断地加工丰富，并进一步根据人物表现的需要和作为综合艺术应有的性能把它们有机地创造性地结合起来了。在旦角的唱腔、服装、扮相各方面也都大胆地进行了若干的改进。他从武戏中，从旦角的各种舞蹈身段中，从其他兄弟剧种中，并直接从生活中，选出了舞蹈素材，通过古装戏“天女散花”、“嫦娥奔月”、“洛神”、“霸王别姬”、“太真外传”、“麻姑献寿”、“西施”等剧在加强京剧表演的舞蹈性上进行了精心创造；而且也通过时装戏“孽海波澜”、“邓霞姑”、“一缕麻”进行过表现当代生活的尝试。
    周先生在京剧界一向是以勇于革新著称的。他的传统艺术的根基是深厚的，他的功夫大有助于他的表演；但是旧的格式向来不能限制他的发自内心的性格化的表演创造。幼年时候，老师传授给他的一些戏，如“四进士”、“清风亭”、“打严嵩”……原来人物是并不太突出的，或者说是并不太生动的，而经他不断地琢磨、丰富，充实了生活内容。“戏”出来了，人民性也突出了。他在京剧传统基础上，大胆吸收地方戏曲的经验，吸收现代艺术的经验，而且他又善于溶解，很自由地适当地运用在自己的角色创造上。例如从古典剧目中改编了“临江驿”、“追韩信”等很多戏，他的“清风亭”、“打渔杀家”等剧，受梆子戏的影响很大；“扫松”、“跑城”等剧是徽戏的路子。在原有传统的基础上，无论剧本和表演，周先生都进行了革新和丰富。
    无疑的，他们的革新精神是为人民大众所支持所欢迎的，但也不是平坦无阻的。梅先生早年演出一些新戏，有一些新的创造，就曾遭到许多保守的人们的反对，骂他是“外道天魔”。至于周信芳先生在艺术上的大胆创造，当时，更是被一些人看作是“旁门左道”了。但是，这一切都没有把他们阻挡住，他们终于克服了困难，坚持了艺术上的正确发展。
    五十年来，他们两位很重视和群众的联系，他们虚心好学和诲人不倦的精神，是令人感动的。他们对待艺术的态度，一贯是严肃的。直到现在，他们两位还是在不断的修改和丰富自己的剧本和表演，精益求精，不肯懈怠。
    艺术家的艺术素养和道德品质，总是彼此密切地联系着的，而且正是在这种联系中产生了伟大的艺术。梅、周两位过去自然也是无例外地遭受着帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三座大山的残酷压迫，生活的痛苦经历和人民要求解放争取解放的革命斗争的影响使他们逐步觉醒，并由于人民的优美道德传统的影响和善于从现实主义的艺术创作中汲取了若干积极的精神力量，培养了自己的道德品质。反过来，又通过艺术创作，来丰富人民的精神生活。因而他们两位尽管过去生活在旧社会环境，却从来没有把艺术引向堕落，而努力使自己的艺术和爱国的民主的思想相结合。解放以后，接触了新的时代，新的观众——广大工农兵，使他们的艺术增加了新的生命，他们和他们的艺术过去正好像岩石下曲折而顽强地生长出来的枝条一样，现在掀开了岩石，伸长在自由的广阔的天地之中，就更显得欣欣向荣、枝繁叶茂了。
    周扬同志在第一届全国戏曲观摩大会上的总结报告中曾经这样说过：
        “中国戏曲的表演艺术，是杰出的；特别是因
    为中国戏曲综合了歌、舞、剧三者的艺术，就更显
    出了它的非凡的特色。中国戏曲，特别是京剧，曾
    产生了从程长庚到梅兰芳的一系列的天才的表演艺
    术家。他们在舞台上创造了各种不同的人物性格。
    他们的表演艺术是我们整个戏曲遗产的一个极其重
    要的宝贵的部分，必须正确地加以继承和发展。”
    （一九五二年十二月二十七日“人民日报”）
    这样的评价，是确切的；中国人民以有梅兰芳、周信芳先生这些天才的表演艺术家而自豪。他们的经验和成就，是值得特别宝贵的。他们五十年来的艺术道路，是现实主义的道路，爱国主义的道路，必须正确地加以继承和发展。在今天，在祖国正大规模地建设社会主义的今天，艺术家们应当更积极地用马克思列宁主义的学说武装自己，系统地巩固地树立共产主义世界观和社会主义现实主义的创作原则，更密切地和工农兵群众相结合，和我们的新社会、新时代一同前进。梅先生和周先生正在努力地这样做。那末，他们两位走过来的道路所展示的未来和前途，将是无限广阔，无限远大的。让我们敬祝梅、周两位先生青春常在！
