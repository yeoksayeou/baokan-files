    On Lake Head Mountain, forty *hua li* away from Fu'an County, Fujian Province, stand rows of beautiful houses. Not far from these houses is a neat terraced tea garden. Amidst the green tea bushes, groups of workers are busy with intertillage, fertilization, and pruning. Technical cadres are bending over, concentrating on researching tea tree cultivation and pest control. This is Fujian Province's tea science experiment institution—the Fu'an Tea Experiment Station of the Department of Agriculture.

    The experiment station was established in July 1952. At that time, the weeds here were knee-high, a desolate scene. The workers spent three months reclaiming 185 *mu* of tea garden on Yu Keng Gang and Fei Ceng Shan. In 1953, they opened up another 56 *mu* of tea garden. Now, the entire station has 283 *mu* of new-style terraced tea gardens. Planted in the tea gardens are over 30 excellent varieties such as the Yunnan broad-leaf variety and Fujian Province's Da Bai tea.

    The staff of the experiment station actively learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in tea production and apply it to their experimental work. At the bottom layer of the Fei Ceng Shan tea garden, there were four *fen* of double-row strip-planted aging tea trees. After careful pruning, deep plowing, intertillage weeding, fertilization, and rational harvesting, the output of dry Mao tea in 1954 surged to 87 *jin*, equivalent to about 218 *jin* of dry Mao tea per *mu*, six times higher than the average dry Mao tea output in Fujian Province, and the tea quality was excellent. This fact demonstrates a promising future for tea production in Fujian Province.

    In the experiment station's green leaf workshop, withering, fermentation, drying, fixing, rolling, and baking workshops are installing various machines, preparing to produce high-grade export tea this spring. In addition to the 12,000 *jin* of fresh leaves that can be harvested from the station's tea gardens, there is a plan to purchase 40,000 *jin* of fresh leaves from nearby tea farmers this year, using machines for processing. This can reduce costs by more than 1,000 *yuan* and provide experience for mechanized tea production.

    The tea experiment station attracts the surrounding masses like a magnet. Almost every day, tea farmers come to the station to visit. Tea farmers from Shouning, Xiapu and other counties, and neighboring tea farmers from Zhejiang Province travel dozens or even hundreds of *li* to the station to learn cultivation experience. In 1954, three tea farmers from Xiapu County travelled more than 100 *li* to buy more than 4,000 excellent tea seedlings. In 1954 and this spring, the experiment station has promoted more than 400,000 excellent tea seedlings and also supplied more than 70 *jin* of green manure seeds suitable for tea garden planting.

    福安茶业试验站
　　吕俊谦
    距离福建省福安县城四十华里的湖头山上，矗立着一幢幢漂亮的房舍。离这些房舍不远有一片整齐的梯层茶园。在碧绿的茶树丛中，三五成群的工人们正忙着中耕施肥、剪枝，技术干部们躬着腰聚精会神地在研究茶树的栽培和防治病虫害等问题。这里是福建省的茶业科学实验机关——农业厅的福安茶业试验站。
    试验站是一九五二年七月建立的。当时这里杂草过膝，一片荒凉。工人们用三个月工夫，在余坑岗、飞层山垦辟了一百八十五亩茶园。一九五三年，他们又开辟了茶园五十六亩。现在，全站拥有二百八十三亩新式梯层茶园。茶园里栽种的有云南的大叶种、福建省的大白茶等三十多种优良品种。
    试验站的工作人员积极学习苏联茶叶生产中的先进经验，应用到试验工作上。在飞层山茶园底层，有四分双行条列式衰老的茶树，经过精心修剪、深耕、中耕除草、施肥、合理采摘等一系列新的技术措施，一九五四年干毛茶产量激增到八十七斤，折合每亩干毛茶产量约二百十八斤，比福建省一般地区茶园干毛茶产量高六倍，而且茶叶品质优良。这一事实为福建省茶叶生产展示了美好的前景。
    在试验站的绿叶工场里，萎凋、醱酵、干燥、杀青、揉捻、烘焙等车间正在安装各种机器，准备在今年春天生产高级外销茶叶。除站里茶园能采摘鲜叶一万二千斤外，今年计划向附近茶农收购鲜叶四万斤，用机器进行加工。这可使成本费减少一千多元，并为机械化制茶提供经验。
    茶业试验站像磁石般吸引了周围群众。几乎每天都有茶农到站里参观。寿宁、霞浦等县和浙江省邻近的茶农跑数十里以至一两百里路到站里学习栽培经验。一九五四年霞浦县有三个茶农走了一百多里路，到这里买了四千多株优良茶苗。一九五四年和今年春天，试验站已推广优良茶苗四十多万株，另外还供应了适合茶园种植的绿肥种子七十多斤。
