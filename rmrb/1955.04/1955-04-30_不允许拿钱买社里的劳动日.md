According to letters from our reporter Liu Xi, Wang Qinghai, secretary of the "Guizhou Peasant" newspaper, and Liao Qingyuan, Hu Zhankui, Xun Wei, and Pi Wen'an from the Rural Work Department of the Xiangtan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan Province: An extremely unreasonable phenomenon has occurred in some agricultural production cooperatives in Guizhou and Xiangtan County, Hunan Province: some members have abandoned agricultural production to engage in sideline occupations or other professions, and the cooperatives actually allow them to buy labor days from the cooperative with money.

In the Xinchuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wengan County, Guizhou Province, sideline production is uniformly arranged by the cooperative, but the income belongs to the individual. The cooperative stipulates that members engaged in sideline occupations pay four-tenths, four and a half-tenths, or five-tenths of a work point (ten-tenths equals one labor day) to the cooperative depending on the nature of the sideline occupation. The Luochang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Seventh District of Yinjiang County stipulates that members engaged in sideline occupations pay 0.6 yuan for each labor day they work in the cooperative; the seven agricultural production cooperatives in the Eighth District have also adopted this method. The Yongming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Kaiyang County even stipulates that those who turn in their sideline income to the cooperative will be reimbursed with grain at the local market price in the autumn.

The Xiwan Cooperative in Changshi Township, First District, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, stipulates in its cooperative charter that members who go out to engage in sideline occupations can hand over their income to the cooperative, with 0.6 yuan counting as one labor day. The Huangmao Township Agricultural Production Cooperative also stipulates a method of "labor investment": as long as money is provided as "labor investment," it is not necessary to directly participate in agricultural labor, and at the time of profit distribution, the income from the purchased labor days can also be obtained within the labor remuneration. Eighteen of the twenty-eight cooperatives in the First District of Xiangtan have already made "labor investment" provisions.

These practices are wrong. Allowing some members to buy labor days from the cooperative with money is actually equivalent to some members hiring the labor of other members, that is, some people are exploiting others. The more the agricultural production cooperative increases production, the greater the amount of exploitation. For example, the Xinchuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wengan County, Guizhou Province, stipulates that paying 0.4 to 0.5 yuan counts as one work point. According to the general income of agricultural production cooperatives in the local area in 1954, a labor day (ten-tenths) can be distributed at a minimum of 0.7 to 0.8 yuan after the autumn harvest; that is to say, by taking out 0.4 to 0.5 yuan, one can earn 0.7 to 0.8 yuan at the time of the autumn harvest distribution. Isn't buying "labor days" a disguised form of exploitation?

This erroneous practice is detrimental to the production of agricultural production cooperatives and to the consolidation of the cooperative. The facts of the Luochang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yinjiang County, Guizhou Province, clearly illustrate this point: because it is advantageous to engage in sideline occupations, most of the members of this cooperative are vying to engage in sideline occupations. As a result, for more than two months, no one took care of the crops, only thirty *dan* of the entire cooperative's one thousand one hundred and eighty-eight *dan* of terraced fields were plowed, the small-season crops were not sown on time, and the winter green manure was not applied. This phenomenon caused dissatisfaction among many members. Seven of the thirty-seven households requested to withdraw from the cooperative, and member Li Mingqing, fearing that he would have no food to eat in the future, simply went to his own fields to do his own work.

The root cause of this error lies in the fact that these cooperatives are mostly newly established, and most members lack a correct understanding of the consistency between the interests of the cooperative and individual interests, and the idea of individual prosperity is still relatively serious, and they have not yet developed the habit of collective management and collective labor; in addition, the leadership components of some cooperatives are impure, which allows this phenomenon to exist "legally." However, the most important reason is that the cadres leading these cooperatives have a vague understanding of the nature and management policies of agricultural production cooperatives. In the autumn of 1954, when the Xiwan Cooperative in Changshi Township, Xiangtan County, distributed income according to this method, the deputy secretary of the county party committee and the director of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau were both present. As a result of the distribution, those who actually participated in more agricultural labor in the cooperative received less dividends than those who bought labor days; some members were very dissatisfied with this, but the cadres did not try to correct it, but instead "persuaded" these members. It is said that other cooperatives in the county adopted this method by learning from the Xiwan Cooperative, and some cooperatives were even "introduced" to it by working cadres. Some people in Duyun County, Guizhou Province, also regarded this erroneous practice as "experience" to be "promoted."

In agricultural production cooperatives, the increase in members' income has a reliable foundation only when agricultural production develops. Allowing members to abandon agriculture to engage in sideline occupations at will within the cooperative, and allowing the existence of exploitative relationships, not only directly harms the production of the cooperative, but also causes the cooperative to gradually deteriorate and even collapse. Leading cadres in areas with this erroneous practice should conscientiously study the relevant theories and policies of agricultural production cooperatives, learn how to manage agricultural production cooperatives, and properly handle the above-mentioned erroneous practices.

Agricultural production cooperatives may send some members to engage in sideline labor in accordance with the method of division of labor and industry, provided that it is conducive to the development of agricultural production; however, sideline income should be added to agricultural labor income, and distributed by all labor force in the cooperative according to the labor days (work points) worked. The labor days of members engaged in sideline production should be evaluated according to the difficulty and importance of the work, with reference to technical expertise. Generally speaking, sideline labor requires more technology, and some also require going out and running around, which is more hard work, and should be taken into account when evaluating work points. Some sideline production does not require collective management, nor does it delay collective labor, and can still be managed by the members' own households, and there is no need to turn in the income to the cooperative, nor does the cooperative need to record labor days. Those who work outside and have no labor at home, but only land, can hand over the land to the cooperative for rent, and should not join the cooperative.

    不允许拿钱买社里的劳动日
    辛根
    据本报记者　刘希、“贵州农民”报秘书王青海、中共湖南省湘潭地委农村工作部工作人员廖庆沅、胡占魁、寻味、皮问安等同志来信反映：贵州省和湖南省湘潭县有些地方的农业生产合作社里发生了一种极不合理的现象：一部分社员放弃了农业生产去搞副业或者从事别的职业，而合作社竟允许他们用钱买社里的劳动日。
    贵州省瓮安县新川农业生产合作社，副业生产由社统一调动安排，但收入归个人。合作社规定：搞副业的社员按照副业性质的不同，分别向社交四分、四分五、五分算一个工分（十分合一个劳动日）。印江县七区罗场农业生产合作社规定搞副业的社员每交六角钱，就算在社里做了一个劳动日；八区的七个农业生产合作社也都采用了这种办法。开阳县永明农业生产合作社甚至规定凡把副业收入交社的，秋后按当地牌价折还谷子。
    湖南省湘潭县第一区长石乡霞湾社在社章上规定：社员出外搞副业，收入可以交给社里，六角钱算一个劳动日。黄茅乡农业生产合作社也规定了“劳力投资”的办法：只要拿出钱来作为“劳力投资”，不要直接参加农业劳动，到分红时，同样可在劳力报酬内得到所买的劳动日的收入。湘潭一区的二十八个社，已有十八个作了“劳力投资”的规定。
    这些做法是错误的。允许一部分社员用钱买社里的劳动日，实际上就等于一部分社员雇佣了另一部分社员的劳动，也就是一部分人剥削了另一部分人。农业生产合作社增产越多，剥削的数量就越大。如贵州瓮安县新川农业生产合作社规定交四分钱到五分钱记一个工分，按一九五四年当地农业生产合作社的一般收入估计，秋后一个劳动日（十分）最低可以分到七角至八角钱；也就是说，拿出四、五角钱来，秋收分配时就可以收入七、八角钱。买“劳动日”就是变相的剥削，不是很明白的吗？
    这种错误做法对农业生产合作社的生产是不利的，也不利于社的巩固。贵州省印江县罗场农业生产合作社的事实最清楚地说明了这一点：因为搞副业有便宜可占，所以这个社的大部分社员都争着去经营副业。结果，两个多月没人管庄稼活路，全社一千一百八十八挑板田板土只翻了三十挑，小季作物没有按时播种，冬秧青（一种肥料）也没有打。这种现象引起了许多社员不满。三十七户社员有七户要求退社，社员李明青怕将来没饭吃，干脆跑到自己的田里做自己的活路去了。
    产生这种错误的根源，固然在于这些社大都是刚成立的新社，大部分社员对社的利益和个人利益的一致性缺乏正确的认识，个人发家的思想还比较严重，同时也还没有养成集体经营、集体劳动的习惯；加上某些社的领导成分不纯，就使这种现象能够“合法”地存在。但是，最主要的原因，还是领导这些社的工作干部对农业生产合作社的性质和经营方针认识模糊。一九五四年秋天湘潭县长石乡霞湾社按照这种办法分配时，县委副书记、农林局长都在那里。分配的结果，在社里实际参加农业劳动多的人，还不如拿钱买劳动日的人分红多；有些社员对这很不满意，干部不设法纠正，反而向这些社员进行“说服”。据说，这个县别的社采用这种办法，都是跟霞湾社学的，有些社还是由工作干部“介绍”的。贵州省都匀县也有人把这种错误做法当作“经验”来加以“推广”。
    在农业生产合作社里，农业生产发展了，社员收入的增加才有可靠的基础。社内任随社员放弃农业去经营副业，并且允许剥削关系存在，不仅直接损害了社的生产，而且会使社逐渐变质以至垮台。有这种错误做法的地区的领导干部，应该认真研究有关农业生产合作社的理论和政策，学会经营管理农业生产合作社的业务，对以上错误做法进行妥善的处理。
    农业生产合作社在有利于农业生产发展的前提下，按照分工分业的办法派出一部分社员去从事副业劳动是可以的；但副业收入，应当和农业劳动收入加在一起，由全社劳动力按所做的劳动日（工分）来分配。从事副业生产的社员的劳动日，应根据工作的难易轻重，参照技术特长来评定。一般地说，副业劳动需要较多的技术，有些还要出外奔跑，比较辛苦，在评定工分时应当加以照顾。有些副业生产，不需要集体经营，也不耽误集体劳动的，可以仍由社员各户自己经营，不必把收入交给社里，社里也不必给记劳动日。在外工作而家里没有任何劳动力、只有土地的，可把土地交给社里租用，不应入社。
