Lanzhou Under Construction
Yang Kang

　　In the spring morning, as the sun just rises, overlooking the urban area of Lanzhou from the Gaolan Mountain, a scene of a future socialist industrial city unfolds before our eyes: Trains on the Longhai Railway are coming from the east, and trains on the Lanxin Railway are heading west; cars heading to Xinjiang, Qinghai, Sichuan and other places are speeding on the highway; factory chimneys are emitting silver-gray light smoke; on many construction sites, workers are building walls on scaffolding, painting, and workers repairing the two Yellow River iron bridges are entering new operations after completing winter construction; geological surveyors from the Northeast, from Jiangnan, and from all over the country are surveying mineral deposits on the surrounding mountains, and workers are working intensely on drilling, trenching and other work.

　　People far away from Lanzhou, please look towards the center of the motherland's map, next to a transportation hub, that is the city of Lanzhou. This city has a long history, and Jin Cheng Prefecture was established in the Western Han Dynasty. It is a transportation fortress in the Northwest and a link between Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang and the coastal areas. It is rich in resources nearby. In the past few years, through mass prospecting reports and surveys by the People's Government, petroleum, coal, salt, mirabilite, sulfur, gypsum and various metal mineral deposits have been discovered. The Yellow River has huge hydropower potential within Gansu Province.

　　In the past, there were few trees on the mountains here, and people called it "barren land," but since liberation, Lanzhou has been greened year by year, and the bare mountain tops no longer exist. A tree-lined avenue has been newly built from the railway station to the urban area, and tall buildings have appeared on both sides of the avenue. The peach orchards and orchards all over the suburbs decorate this vast urban area into a large garden in the spring. In the future, green belts of 27 meters wide will be built along both sides of the turbulent Yellow River. At that time, the scenery and climate of Lanzhou will be even more attractive.

　　A hundred years ago, people said, "The Yellow River has only one bridge in the world," and this bridge was the floating bridge built by the working people of Lanzhou in the west of Beiguan using wooden boats and rafts; until the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, there were only three Yellow River iron bridges in the whole country. But now, in the urban area of ​​Lanzhou alone, in addition to the Yellow River Iron Bridge built in the late Qing Dynasty (1909), the Yellow River Pontoon Bridge of the Lanxin Railway was completed and opened to traffic as early as 1953, and the two majestic Yellow River main bridges of the Lanxin and Lanyin Railways will also be completed this year.

　　Since liberation, a woolen textile factory, a tannery and a flour mill have been newly built here. The power plant is undergoing its second expansion project, and several building materials factories are under construction. In order to transport a large number of building materials to the site, several wide roads of 30 to 50 meters have been opened; large-scale tap water and sewer projects are also under survey and design; the factory buildings of several large industrial enterprises are about to begin construction, and many preparations have been completed. The workers are welcoming the historically significant construction days with a happy mood and active labor.

    兰州在建设中
    杨康
    春天的早晨，太阳刚刚升起，从皋兰山上俯瞰兰州市区，一副未来的社会主义工业城市的景象呈现在眼前：陇海铁路的列车从东开过来了，兰新铁路的列车正往西驶去；开往新疆、青海、四川等地的汽车在公路上奔驰；工厂的烟囱冒着银灰色的淡烟；许多建筑工地的工人在脚手架上砌墙，粉刷，修建两座黄河大铁桥的工人们，在完成了冬季施工之后又进入了新的作业；从东北、从江南、从祖国各地来到这里的地质勘测人员，在四周山上调查着矿藏的情况，工人们在紧张地进行着钻探、槽探等工作。
    远离兰州的人们，请你们向祖国地图的中心点望去，在一个交通枢纽点的旁边，那就是兰州城。这座城市有着悠久的历史，在西汉时即设金城郡。它是西北的交通要塞，又是甘肃、青海、新疆联系沿海各地的纽带。它的附近资源丰富，几年来经过群众找矿报矿，人民政府派人调查勘测，已经发现了石油、煤、盐、芒硝、硫磺、石膏和各种金属矿藏。黄河在甘肃境内蕴藏着巨大的水力发电力量。
    过去，这里的山上树木很少，人们称它为“不毛之地”，但，在解放后逐年进行了绿化兰州的工作，光秃的山顶就不再存在了。由火车站通往市区新修了林荫大道，大道两边出现了高大的建筑物。遍布郊区的桃林、果园，在春季里把这广阔的市区点缀成一座大花园。将来，沿着波涛澎湃的黄河两岸，还要建设起各二十七公尺宽的绿化地带，那时，兰州的风景和气候就更加引人入胜了。
    一百年前，人们都说“天下黄河只一桥”，这座桥就是兰州劳动人民在北关西边用木船和木筏搭起来的浮桥；直到国民党反动统治时期，全国也只有三座黄河铁桥。可是现在仅在兰州市区，除建造于清末（一九○九年）的黄河铁桥外，兰新铁路的黄河便桥早在一九五三年已经建成通车，兰新和兰银铁路的两座雄伟的黄河正桥也将在今年内建成。
    解放后，这里新建了毛纺织厂、制革厂和面粉厂，发电厂正在进行第二次扩建工程，几个建筑材料厂正在兴工修建。为了把大批建筑材料运往场地，已经开辟了几条三十公尺至五十公尺宽的大马路；规模宏大的自来水和下水道工程也正在勘测设计；几项大工业企业的厂房建筑将要开始了，许多准备工作已经就绪，工人们正在以愉快的心情和积极的劳动，迎接着具有历史意义的施工日子的到来。
