Xinhua News Agency, London, 16th: The strike of electrical workers and machine workers in London newspaper printing plants, held due to demands for wage increases, has persisted for twenty-two days as of the 15th.

　　On the 14th, the British Ministry of Labour convened a meeting between labor and management, attempting to force the striking workers to return to work, but it was unsuccessful. On the 15th, the management announced the dismissal of approximately 20,000 workers in other printing plant trades, attempting to provoke these workers to oppose the striking workers and force them to return to work. However, the striking workers clearly stated: unless their demands for wage increases are immediately met, they will never return to work.

    伦敦各报印刷厂的工人
    坚持罢工已达二十二天
    新华社十六日讯　伦敦消息：伦敦各报印刷厂的电气工人和机器工人因为要求增加工资而举行的罢工，到十五日为止，已经坚持了二十二天。
    十四日，英国劳工部召集劳资双方举行会谈，企图迫使罢工工人复工，但是没有成功。十五日，资方宣布解雇印刷厂其他工种的约两万个工人，企图挑拨这些工人起来反对罢工工人，而迫使他们复工。但是罢工工人明确表示：除非立刻满足他们增加工资的要求，否则绝不复工。
