    Practice Strict Economy and Oppose Waste in Capital Construction!
    To Be a True Architect of the People
    Architect, Beijing Design Institute, Zhang Kaiji

    Currently, the phenomenon of waste in construction is very serious. Although the reasons for this phenomenon are multifaceted, the most important reason is that our architectural design has an erroneous ideological tendency to pursue form and ignore economic principles.

    When I was designing the "Four Ministries and One Commission" office building, it was because I one-sidedly pursued the outline of the building and installed only a few large roofs on the building, which wasted more than 300,000 yuan of the country's money. If this money were saved, it could build three or four thousand square meters of housing, and housing is what the people urgently need!

    Blindly adopting large roofs and unilaterally pursuing the outline of buildings causes a great deal of waste. In the past few years, this tendency has almost spread throughout the country. In Beijing alone, the waste in large roofs is several million yuan. If the waste figures for large roofs across the country are totaled, it would be even more alarming. Facts have proven that this practice of abandoning economic principles and simply pursuing the outline of buildings requires a very high price. If it continues to develop, it will directly affect the country's industrialization. Pursue the outline of architectural form? Or implement the Party's general line and realize socialist industrialization? This is an acute question placed before me and many architects, and I did not correctly resolve it when designing the "Four Ministries and One Commission" office building.

    The phenomenon of waste in architecture is also manifested in isolating the aesthetic appeal of buildings, blindly imitating the past, and pursuing luxury and cumbersome decorations. Architecture reflects reality. For example, the intricate and ornate "Rococo" architectural style reflected the extravagant and decadent court life of the French Louis era. Today, when all the people of our country are working diligently and thriftily for socialist industrialization, our architects are still using cumbersome decorations and expensive building materials to express the beauty of architecture. This separates architecture from the people's real lives, and therefore cannot meet the people's requirements. In fact, whether a building is beautiful or not is not determined by the amount of its decoration. Such overly cumbersome decorations not only fail to enrich the building's artistry, but also reveal the poverty and vulgarity of architectural design ideas and techniques. It not only causes waste, but also does not produce good results. For example, on the gable of the large roof of the Beijing Western Suburbs Guest House, because too much gold leaf was applied, it was dazzling with golden light, and the other decorations and patterns on it were not clear. Another example is a newly built office building located on the east side of Xisi South Street in Beijing. Because many lattice windows were installed, it not only wasted manpower and materials, but also reduced the amount of lighting. Gold is expensive, and wood is very much needed in national construction, but it is wasted on unnecessary decorations. For example, many rooms in the International Hotel and the Beijing Hotel have hardwood wainscoting. Especially in the International Hotel, the entire reinforced concrete grand staircase is decorated with wood, which is completely unnecessary. Some buildings even waste several tons of copper on copper lamps, copper handrails, etc. In my design of the "Four Ministries and One Commission" project, I always thought that the decoration was simple, but after this anti-waste campaign, the design of the main building was modified, the decoration was simplified, and the standards for decoration and materials were lowered, which saved 200,000 yuan.

    In architecture, in order to "be different" and for "interest," the facade of the building is often treated in a very peculiar way or the shape is very cumbersome. This cumbersome shape not only increases the area of the exterior walls and roof, but also complicates the structure and construction, increases the heat dissipation area of the house, resulting in waste in civil engineering and equipment, and increases the expenditure of regular expenses. The newly built International Hotel is not very large in size, but the architect has made the upper floors into a stepped form. The shape of the small auditorium at the rear of the Western Suburbs Guest House is also very cumbersome. The waste in these areas is often difficult to calculate.

    There is even greater waste than in the treatment of the external appearance of the building, that is, the unreasonable and extravagant phenomena in the layout and internal planning. For example, the Central Ministry of Health stipulates that the quota of building area occupied by each hospital bed is 38 square meters, while in some large hospitals newly built in Beijing, the building area occupied by each bed is up to 60 square meters at most, and at least more than 40 square meters, generally exceeding the quota, and some even exceed it by one time. This makes many patients who should be hospitalized unable to be hospitalized due to lack of beds, and people who should be recuperating unable to recuperate due to limited beds. Unreasonable internal layout will not only greatly reduce the usable area of the house, but sometimes also increase regular management costs. A person in charge of the New Qiao Hotel once said: Due to the poor internal layout of the New Qiao Hotel, they have increased many unnecessary management personnel, resulting in long-term waste. As for the increase in construction costs due to uneconomical structures, there are many examples. For example, the foundation of the Beijing Hotel used a lot of steel bars. Another example is that some buildings have windows that are designed too large, and sanitary equipment is designed too scattered. Even if equipment engineers are careful in their calculations, the waste cannot be compensated. Therefore, it is very important for architects to cooperate with various professional engineers to comprehensively consider economic issues.

    There are also many architects who, in order to show "grandeur," often rarely consider economy in the overall plan design. For example, the Central University for Nationalities, which I designed, is due to the unreasonable overall plan design, the houses are too scattered, and the building density is too low. As a result, it not only wastes construction land, increases the cost of roads, power lines, and public facilities such as water supply and drainage, but also increases the hard work of teachers and students in the college who travel between various buildings. In addition, when I designed the Sanlihe and Baiwanzhuang residential areas in Beijing, because I did not understand the relationship between the depth of the house and the cost, I set the depth of the houses in the two residential areas too low, which also increased the cost of the entire project. Now, several colleges in the western suburbs cultural and educational district also have serious waste phenomena due to the relatively scattered buildings.

    Many facts above prove that due to the tendency of pursuing form and ignoring economy in our architectural design thinking, the waste caused to the country is serious in all aspects. Therefore, paying attention to reducing construction costs in design should be the most important political task for our architects today. I believe that as long as our architects can stop thinking about how to lay out the plan extravagantly and enrich the elevation; and concentrate on considering how to arrange the plan more compactly and treat the elevation more concisely, the construction cost will be significantly reduced. Many of our architects like to talk about the form of architecture in their work, have the "celebrity style" of the old society, and are unwilling to talk about the amount of construction cost, thinking that talking about the cost is "vulgar," which is essentially a manifestation of not caring about the people's property. As for those who attempt to show their "talent" or "superiority" at the expense of high costs, it is even more wrong. This is a lack of a sense of ownership. For example, many of our architects may be very frugal in their private lives, and they have to calculate carefully even when spending a few yuan or a few jiao, but they are indifferent to wasting a lot of the country's wealth in their work. This is certainly not an attitude of ownership.

    In the past, due to errors in my design thinking, I did not complete the tasks assigned to me by the country well, but caused great waste to the country. I am very ashamed, but I am not discouraged. I believe that as long as I can establish correct design thinking, I will definitely make up for the losses I caused to the country in the past in my future practical work. At the same time, I suggest that our architects work closely with various professional engineers to strive for the comprehensive implementation of the architectural principles pointed out by the Party and the government. Let us encourage each other in our work and be a true architect of the people!

    厉行节约，反对基本建设中的浪费！
    做一个真正的人民的建筑师
    北京设计院建筑师　张开济
    目前，建筑中的浪费现象是十分严重的。造成这种现象的原因虽然是多方面的，但其中最主要的原因是我们建筑设计中存在追求形式、忽视经济原则的错误思想倾向。
    我在设计“四部一会”办公大楼时，就是由于片面追求建筑的轮廓线，仅在建筑物上安上了几个大屋顶，就给国家浪费了三十多万元。如果把这笔钱节省下来，就可以建造三、四千平方公尺的住宅，而住宅是人民多么迫切需要的啊！
    盲目地采用大屋顶，片面追求房屋轮廓线所造成的浪费是十分严重的。几年来，这种倾向几乎遍及全国，只说北京一地，在大屋顶方面的浪费就有几百万元，如果把全国各地在大屋顶方面的浪费数字统计起来，那就更惊人了。事实证明，这种放弃经济原则，单纯追求建筑轮廓线的做法，所需要的代价是非常昂贵的，如果继续发展下去，将直接影响国家工业化。追求建筑形式的轮廓线呢？还是贯彻党的总路线、实现社会主义工业化呢？这是摆在我个人和许多建筑师面前一个尖锐的问题，而我在设计“四部一会”办公大楼时却没有正确地予以解决。
    建筑中的浪费现象，还表现在把建筑上的美观孤立起来，一味仿古，追求豪华和繁琐的装饰。建筑是反映现实的。例如“洛可可”建筑风格的繁琐华丽就反映了法国路易时代宫庭生活的奢侈靡烂。今天，当我们全国人民都在为社会主义工业化克勤克俭的时候，而我们建筑师却还以繁琐的装饰和高贵的建筑材料去表现建筑的美观，这就使建筑脱离了人民现实的生活，因此也是不能符合人民要求的。其实，一座建筑物的美和不美，并不决定于它的装饰的多少。那种过份繁琐的装饰，不但不能丰富建筑物的艺术性，反而显示了建筑设计思想和技术的贫乏和庸俗，不但造成浪费，而且效果并不好。如北京西郊招待所大屋顶上的山花板上，因为金子贴得太多，一片金光耀目，而上面的其它装饰和图案反而看不清楚了。再如座落在北京西四南大街路东的一座新建的办公大楼的窗子上，由于安上了许多花格子，不但费工费料，而且还减少了采光面。金子是贵的，木料是国家建设中非常需要的，但是却被浪费在不必要的装饰上了。如国际饭店和北京饭店内的许多房间里都做了硬木墙围。尤其是在国际饭店内，全部钢筋混凝土的大楼梯都用木材装饰起来，这完全是不必要的。甚至有的建筑物，光铜灯、铜扶手等就浪费了几吨重的铜料。在我设计的“四部一会”工程中，总以为在装修方面是俭朴的，但在此次反浪费之后，把主楼的设计修改了，简化了装饰，降低了装修和用料标准，就节省了二十万元。
    在建筑中为了“标新立异”，为了“趣味”，常常把建筑的立面处理得很奇特或者是体型很繁琐。这种繁琐的体型不仅增加了外墙和屋顶的面积，而且使结构和施工复杂化，增加了房屋的散热面积，以致造成土建部分和设备上的浪费以及加大经常费用的开支。新盖的国际饭店，体型并不太大，建筑师却把它上面的几层做成了踏步的形式。西郊招待所后部的小礼堂的体型同样很繁琐。这些方面的浪费常常是难以计算的。
    还有比房屋外型处理方面浪费更大的，那就是平面布置和内部规划上的不合理和铺张现象。例如，中央卫生部规定医院的每一病床占用的建筑面积定额是三十八平方公尺，而北京新盖的某些大医院，每一病床占用的建筑面积最多的达六十平方公尺，最少的也有四十多平方公尺，普遍超过定额，有的竟超过一倍。这样就使得很多应该住院的病人因没有床位而不能住院，应该疗养的人因床位有限而不能疗养。内部布置不合理，不但会大大减少房屋的使用面积，有时候也会增加经常的管理费用。新侨饭店的一位负责人就曾说过：由于新侨饭店内部布置的不好，使他们增加了许多不必要的管理人员，造成长期的浪费。至于由于结构不经济而提高建筑造价的也很多。如北京饭店的基础使用很多的钢筋就是一例。又如有的建筑物因为窗子设计得太大，卫生设备设计得太分散，即使设备工程师如何精打细算，其浪费也是无法抵偿的。因此，建筑师如何同各专业工程师配合来全面考虑经济问题，是很重要的。
    还有不少的建筑师为了表现“气派”，在总平面设计上常常是很少考虑经济的。如我设计的中央民族学院，就是由于总平面设计的不合理，房屋太分散，建筑密度太低，结果不仅浪费了建筑用地，增加了道路电线和上下水道等公用设施的费用，而且更增加了院内师生来往各建筑物之间奔走的劳碌。另外，在我设计北京三里河和百万庄两个住宅区的时候，由于不了解房屋深度同造价的关系，把两个住宅区房屋的深度定得太低了，结果也增加了全部工程的造价。现在，西郊文教区的几个学院，由于建筑比较分散，也同样有严重的浪费现象。
    从以上许多事实证明，由于我们建筑设计思想存在追求形式忽视经济的倾向，给国家造成的浪费表现在各个方面都是严重的。因此，在设计中注意降低建筑造价应该是我们建筑师当前最重要的政治任务。我相信，只要我们建筑师能不去考虑如何铺张平面、丰富立面；而把注意力集中考虑如何把平面布置得更紧凑一些，立面处理得更简洁一些，建筑造价是会显著下降的。我们不少建筑师在工作中爱谈建筑的形式如何，有旧社会的“名士作风”，不愿谈建筑造价的多少，认为一谈造价就是“俗气”了，这实质上是对人民财产不关心的表现。至于企图以昂贵的造价来表现自己的“才能”或“高人一等”的人，则更是错误的，这是缺乏主人翁态度的。例如：我们有不少建筑师，在私生活方面可能是十分俭朴的，花几元几角钱都要打打算盘，但在工作中浪费了国家许多财富，却满不在乎。这当然不是主人翁态度。
    我过去由于设计思想上的错误，没有很好地完成国家交给我的任务，反而给国家造成了很大的浪费，我很惭愧，但是我并不灰心，我相信，只要我能树立正确的设计思想，我一定会在以后的实际工作中弥补过去给国家造成的损失。同时，我建议我们建筑师同各专业工程师密切配合起来，为全面贯彻党和政府所指出的建筑原则而努力。让我们在工作中共勉，做一个真正的人民的建筑师！
