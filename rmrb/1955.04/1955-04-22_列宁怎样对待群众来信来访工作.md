Lenin, in leading the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet state, attached great importance to giving play to the creativity and initiative of the masses. Lenin believed that attracting the people to manage the country and actively participate in national construction was one of the most important tasks of the Party. And conscientiously handling letters from the people and receiving visits from the people is an important method for the proletarian party and the Soviet regime to maintain close ties with the broad masses and attract them to participate in state management and socialist construction.

Lenin attached importance to the work of handling letters and visits from the people. In December 1918, not long after the establishment of the Soviet regime, Lenin clearly stipulated in the "Draft Administrative Regulations of Soviet Organs," which he personally drafted: Every Soviet organ must conscientiously handle letters from the people and receive visits from the people. The draft also required the People's Commissariats of Labor, State Supervision, and Justice to establish inquiry bureaus in various places and announce the office dates and times to the people; for the convenience of the masses, office hours should be stipulated even on Sundays and holidays. These inquiry bureaus should not only handle all questions raised by the people orally or in writing, but also write petitions free of charge for those who are illiterate or cannot write.

Lenin himself set a great example for us in conscientiously dealing with letters and visits from the masses. Lenin not only educated the masses, but also paid close attention to listening to their opinions and learning from them, and severely condemned all those who treated the masses with an arrogant attitude. Lenin was very angry with those personnel who handled letters and visits from the masses with a bureaucratic attitude, delaying and accumulating them, and he demanded that these people be severely punished.

Lenin paid attention to letters from workers and peasants, and he often cared about the content of these letters. In January 1922, Lenin wrote to Kalbin, the editor of the "Poor Peasants' Newspaper": "Could you briefly inform me (at most two or three pages): How many letters from peasants has the 'Poor Peasants' Newspaper' received? What important (especially important) and new things are in these letters? What is the mood? What are the current problems? Can such a letter be received every two months?" Lenin often personally read letters sent to him by the masses from all over the country, and quickly replied and instructed on how to handle them. Lenin not only carefully understood the thoughts of the peasants and the life of the countryside from the letters of the peasants, but also from their visits. Lenin often received many peasants from all over the country and talked to them cordially. American progressive writer Albert Rhys Williams, in a book recalling Lenin, narrated an interesting story. When he was in Moscow, he was once invited to meet Lenin. At that time, Lenin was talking to peasants, so he waited in the reception room for more than an hour before seeing Lenin. Williams initially thought: It must be a particularly important national event, or a particularly important person who had delayed him, because Lenin was usually very punctual, but when Lenin's door opened, it turned out that the person being received was an ordinary peasant, dressed in a sheepskin coat and straw shoes, a typical poor peasant. When Williams walked into Lenin's room, Lenin said to him: "Please forgive me. This is a peasant from the Tambov province, and I wanted to hear his thoughts on electrification, collectivization, and repayment of the Tsar's loans. It was so interesting and moving that I completely forgot the time."

Lenin always consulted with the masses and listened to their opinions when deciding important matters. He regarded the materials from letters and visits from the masses as an important basis for deciding the Party's policies and implementing correct leadership. In early 1921, the Soviet Union transitioned from War Communism to the New Economic Policy, which was a major shift in the policy of the Soviet Communist Party. When formulating this policy, Lenin repeatedly talked with peasants, read many letters from peasants, and used these materials.

Lenin attached great importance to the role of letters and visits from the masses in improving the work of state leading organs. He believed that criticism and accusations from the masses from bottom to top were important weapons against bureaucracy, against violations of laws and regulations, and for purifying state organs. In the "Draft Administrative Regulations of Soviet Organs," he clearly pointed out that the reason for stipulating the above regulations was "in order to oppose bureaucratic habits, in order to more effectively discover abuse of power, and to expose and eliminate bad public officials who have infiltrated into Soviet organs." In 1919, Lenin appointed Stalin to preside over the State Supervision Department, and he instructed Stalin that one of the main tasks in supervision work was to conduct sudden inspections based on citizens' accusations. Lenin himself was very effective in using letters and visits from the masses to fight against bureaucracy and violations of laws and regulations. Lenin did not show any mercy to those serious bureaucrats and lawbreakers, and he advocated giving them the most severe punishment. In 1921, a Red Army soldier went to Moscow and wrote a letter to Lenin, reflecting that some cadres in the Don region had abused their power and committed illegal acts such as embezzlement and theft, which had aroused great indignation among the local masses. After seeing this letter, Lenin immediately made a copy of the original letter to Comrade Molotov, secretary of the Central Secretariat, and suggested that the All-Russian Central Executive Committee appoint several comrades and a dozen or twenty students from Sverdlov University to form a special committee to go to the Don region with the letter writer to investigate this illegal case. If the investigation was completely true, those who had committed serious crimes would be shot on the spot. Lenin also wrote on a note to Comrade Molotov: "Quickly find the author of the letter, meet him, comfort him, and tell him that I am sick, but I will urge the handling of the case he raised."

Lenin believed that handling typical cases to promote the struggle against bureaucracy and violations of laws and regulations in the entire state organ was of great significance. In September 1921, in a "Letter to Kursky, People's Commissar of Justice, on the Question of Fighting Bureaucracy by Judicial Means," Lenin said that it was necessary to select "the most conspicuous" cases and conduct political trials on each case. Lenin once received a letter of complaint from a female teacher, Ivanova. After reading it, he immediately sent someone to investigate, and seized this case to issue a notice to various counties and townships, letting the broad masses know that evidence-based accusations are of great significance and can achieve great results.

Of course, not all the problems discussed in letters and visits are correct. During the transition period when the Soviet Union was in a period of sharp and complex class struggle, Lenin received various letters opposing the Soviet government, and many letters that seemed sincere on the surface but were actually malicious, including some written by class enemies. But Lenin never fell for these people's tricks. Lenin's brilliance lay in his ability to analyze these letters carefully, and to treat the letters of people of different classes and attitudes correctly, not according to a formula, but by distinguishing different situations.

The above is just a part of the examples of Lenin's treatment of the work of handling letters and visits from the masses. But it fully illustrates how much Lenin valued the close connection between state organs and the masses, and valued the work of letters and visits from the masses. Today, as we commemorate Lenin, we must conscientiously learn from Lenin's great example, overcome the shortcomings in our work, further improve the work of handling letters and visits from the masses, strengthen the connection between our state organs and the masses, and actively give play to the initiative and enthusiasm of the people in socialist construction.

    列宁怎样对待群众来信来访工作
    戚本禹
    列宁在领导苏联共产党和苏维埃国家的活动中，极其重视发挥群众的创造性和积极性。列宁认为吸引人民群众来管理国家和积极参加国家建设，是党的最重要任务之一。而认真处理人民来信，接见人民来访乃是无产阶级政党和苏维埃政权跟广大群众保持密切联系，吸引他们参加国家管理和社会主义建设的一项重要方法。
    列宁重视处理人民群众来信来访的工作。在一九一八年十二月苏维埃政权刚建立不久的时候，列宁就在其亲手制定的“苏维埃机关行政条例草案”中明确规定：每个苏维埃机关都必须认真处理人民来信和接待人民来访。草案并要求苏维埃劳动、国家监察、司法等人民委员部都要在各处设立问讯局，并把办公日期、时间通告人民；为了便利群众起见，即使星期天和例假日也要规定办公时间。这些问讯局不仅要处理人民群众口头或书信提出的一切问题，而且还要替不识字或不会写的人，免费代写申诉书。
    列宁本人在认真对待群众来信来访工作中给我们树立了伟大的榜样。列宁不但教育群众，同时又非常注意倾听群众的意见，向群众学习，并严厉地斥责一切以傲慢态度对待群众的人。对那些用官僚主义态度处理群众来信来访，因拖延积压群众来信而失职的人员，列宁非常生气，他要求严厉惩办这些人。
    列宁注意工农来信，他经常关怀工农来信的内容。一九二二年一月，列宁给“贫农报”的编辑卡尔宾斯基写道：“是否可以简略示知（最多两三页）：‘贫农报’收到的农民来信有多少？在这些信中有什么重要的（特别重要的）和新的东西？情绪怎样？当前问题是什么？能否做到每两个月收到一次这样的信？”列宁经常亲自阅读各地群众寄给他的信件，并迅速回复和批示处理意见。列宁不但从农民来信而且从农民的来访中细心了解农民的思想和农村的生活。列宁经常接见许多来自全国各地的农民，亲切地同他们谈话。美国进步作家阿尔勃特·里斯·威廉斯在回忆列宁的一本书里，曾叙述过一段有趣的话。他在莫斯科时，有一次他被邀谒见列宁，当时列宁因同农民谈话，于是他在会客室等候了一个多钟头才会到列宁。威廉斯起初料想：一定是某一件特别重要的国家大事，某一特别重要人物耽误了他，因为列宁平常总是很遵守时间的，但当列宁的房门打开时，原来被接见的是一个平平常常，穿着羊皮袄和草鞋的农民，一个典型的贫农。当威廉斯走进列宁的房里时，列宁对他说：“请原谅我。这是唐波夫省的一个农民，我想听听他对于电气化、集体化和偿付沙皇借款的想法。是这样有趣而动人，我完全把时间忘记了。”
    列宁在决定重要事情时，总是先和群众商量，听取群众的意见。他把群众来信来访的材料，看成是决定党的政策和实行正确领导的重要依据。一九二一年初，苏联从战时共产主义过渡到新经济政策，这是苏联共产党在政策上的重大的转变。在制定这一政策的时候，列宁曾屡次同农民谈话，看了许多农民的来信，并利用了这些材料。
    列宁极其重视群众来信来访在改进国家领导机关工作中的作用。他认为群众自下而上的批评和告发，是反对官僚主义，反对违法乱纪，纯洁国家机关的重要武器。他在“苏维埃机关行政条例草案”中即明白指出，规定上述条例的原因就是“为了反对官僚习气，为了更能有成效地发现滥用职权，以及揭露和消灭混入苏维埃机关里来的不良公务人员”。一九一九年列宁曾任命斯大林主持国家监察部，他给斯大林指示说，在监察工作方面的主要任务之一，就是要根据公民控告来作突然的检查。列宁本人就是非常有效地运用群众来信来访去同官僚主义、违法乱纪现象作斗争的。列宁对待那些严重的官僚主义者、违法乱纪的分子是丝毫不留情面的，他主张给予他们最严厉的惩罚。一九二一年有一个红军战士到莫斯科写了一封信给列宁，信中反映顿河地区某些干部有滥用职权和贪污、盗窃等违法行为，这些行为已引起当地群众极大的愤慨。列宁看到这封信以后，马上把原信抄了一份给中央书记处书记莫洛托夫同志，建议由全俄中央执行委员会指定几个同志和一二十个斯维尔德洛夫大学学生组织一个特别委员会，带着来信人到顿河区去调查这件违法案件，如果调查情况完全属实，即把这些犯了严重罪行的人就地枪决。列宁在给莫洛托夫同志的字条上还写道：“火速找到来信作者，接见他，安慰他，告诉他说，我有病，但他所提出的案子，我是会督促办理的。”
    列宁认为通过典型案件的处理，来推动整个国家机关的反官僚主义和反违法乱纪的斗争，有重要意义。一九二一年九月列宁在“关于用司法手段与官僚习气作斗争的问题给司法人民委员长库尔斯基的信”中说，要选择“最惹人注目”的案件，并对每件案子加以政治上的审判。列宁有一次接到一个女教师伊万诺娃的控诉信，他看后立即派人调查，并且抓住这件案子向各县各乡发布通告，让广大群众知道：证据确凿的控告有重大意义，并能收到重大效果。
    当然，并不是所有的来信来访所谈的问题都是正确的，在苏联处于阶级斗争十分尖锐复杂的过渡时期中，列宁曾接到各种反对苏维埃政府的信件，接到许多表面似乎是诚恳的，但实际是含有恶意的信件，其中还有些是阶级敌人写来的信件。但是列宁从没有上过这些人的当，列宁英明的地方就是他善于细密地分析这些信件，不是按一个公式而是分别不同情况正确地对待各种不同阶级不同态度的人的来信。
    上面所叙述的，只是列宁对待群众来信来访工作的一部分事例。但已充分地说明列宁是何等重视国家机关同群众的密切联系、重视群众的来信来访工作了。今天，我们纪念列宁，必须认真学习列宁的伟大榜样，克服我们工作中的缺点，进一步做好群众来信来访工作，密切我们国家机关同群众的联系，积极发挥人民群众在社会主义建设中的主动性和积极性。
