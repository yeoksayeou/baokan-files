Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 7th: As previously reported, on February 16th, the Soviet representative in Tokyo, Domnitsky, presented a statement to Japanese Prime Minister Hatoyama, responding to the note of February 5th from Japanese Permanent Observer to the United Nations, Ambassador Renzo Sawada. The statement pointed out: The Soviet government notes with satisfaction the Japanese government's statement in the note saying that the Japanese government agrees with the Soviet government's suggestion to exchange views on possible steps toward normalizing Soviet-Japanese relations, and that it is prepared to begin negotiations for this purpose.

On February 23rd, Japanese Ambassador Sawada presented a reply note from the Japanese government to the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Sobolev. In this note, the Japanese government stated that it was willing to begin negotiations on the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations and said that it hoped to choose New York as the venue for the negotiations.

On April 4th, the Soviet representative in Tokyo, Domnitsky, met with Mr. Matsumoto, the representative of the Japanese government, and gave him a statement that read as follows:

	"To Prime Minister Hatoyama of Japan,

	On February 23rd, Ambassador Sawada, the Japanese Permanent Observer to the United Nations, delivered to Ambassador Sobolev, the Soviet Permanent Representative to the United Nations, a note regarding the location of the planned negotiations on the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations.

	After studying the aforementioned note from the Japanese government, the Soviet government has come to the conclusion that, under the existing conditions, it is appropriate to choose one of the capitals of the directly relevant countries, namely Tokyo or Moscow, as the location for the Soviet-Japanese negotiations.

	The Soviet government takes into consideration that Prime Minister Hatoyama, in his speeches in Fukuoka and Kagoshima on February 5th and 7th, mentioned the possibility of holding the aforementioned negotiations in Moscow or Tokyo. The Japanese side's representatives also expressed the same opinion during talks with the Soviet representative in Tokyo.

	In view of the above, the Soviet government would like to know the Japanese government's opinion on whether the negotiations on the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations should be held in Moscow or Tokyo."

No response from the Japanese government to the Soviet government's statement of April 4th has been received yet.

However, according to foreign news agencies, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives discussed the aforementioned statement of the Soviet government at a meeting held on April 6th. When speaking about the content of the Soviet government's statement at this meeting, Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, among other things, insisted that the Japanese side's representatives did not mention the possibility of conducting Soviet-Japanese negotiations in Moscow or Tokyo during talks with the Soviet representative in Tokyo.

Shigemitsu's statement is understood to be inconsistent with the facts. In fact, the Japanese side's representatives did express the opinion that negotiations on the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations could be held in Moscow or Tokyo during talks with Soviet representative Domnitsky.

    苏联驻东京代表向日本首相提出一项声明
    认为宜选择直接有关的国家的首都之一作为苏日谈判地点
    新华社八日　讯塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：前已报道，二月十六日，苏联驻东京代表多穆尼茨基对日本首相鸠山提出了一项声明，答复日本常驻联合国观察员泽田廉三大使二月五日的照会。这项声明指出：苏联政府满意地注意到日本政府在照会中的声明所说，日本政府同意苏联政府关于就日苏关系正常化的可能的步骤问题交换意见的建议，它已准备为这一目的开始谈判。
    二月二十三日，日本大使泽田向苏联驻联合国代表索波列夫提出了日本政府的一项复照。日本政府在这项照会中表示，它愿意就日苏关系正常化开始谈判，并且说，它希望选择纽约为谈判地点。
    四月四日，苏联驻东京代表多穆尼茨基同日本政府代表松本先生会见，交给他一项声明，内容如下：
      “致日本首相鸠山先生
    二月二十三日，日本常驻联合国观察员泽田大使交给苏联驻联合国常驻代表索波列夫大使一项关于计划中的苏日关系正常化谈判的地点的照会。
    苏联政府在研究了上述日本政府照会之后，得出了这样的结论：在现有条件下，选择直接有关的国家的首都之一，即东京或莫斯科，作为苏日谈判的地点是适宜的。
    苏联政府考虑到：首相鸠山先生于二月五日和七日在福冈市和鹿儿岛市发表的谈话曾提到在莫斯科或东京举行上述谈判的可能性。日本方面的代表在和苏联驻东京的代表会谈时也表示了同样的意见。
    鉴于以上所述，苏联政府愿意知道日本政府对于苏日关系正常化的谈判是在莫斯科还是在东京举行的意见。”
    目前还没有接到日本政府对于苏联政府四月四日声明的答复。
    不过，据外国通讯社报道，日本国会众议院外务委员会在四月六日举行的会议上讨论了苏联政府的上述声明。日本外务相重光先生在这次会议上讲到苏联政府声明的内容时，除了其他的事情以外，硬说日本方面的代表在和苏联驻东京的代表会谈时没有提到在莫斯科或东京进行苏日谈判的可能性。
    重光葵先生的说法被了解为和事实有出入。事实上，日本方面的代表在和苏联代表多穆尼茨基会谈时曾经表示这样的意见：关于苏日关系正常化的谈判可以在莫斯科或东京举行。
