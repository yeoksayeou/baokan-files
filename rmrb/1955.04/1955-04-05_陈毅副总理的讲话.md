Respected Ambassador, Comrades, Friends:
    Today is the glorious tenth anniversary of the liberation of Hungary. At this grand celebratory banquet, please allow me, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, to extend our heartfelt and warm congratulations to you, Ambassador, and through you to the Government of the People's Republic of Hungary and the Hungarian people.
    The liberated Hungarian people, under the leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party and the Government of the People's Republic of Hungary, and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, have achieved brilliant accomplishments in the cause of building their new life through ten years of diligent and creative labor. The path taken by the glorious Hungarian people over the past ten years is a path of consolidating the people's democratic system, a path of vigorous development of socialist economy and national culture, and a path of continuous growth in the living standards and welfare of the working people. The achievements of the Hungarian people in all aspects have strengthened the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and encouraged the Chinese people who are engaged in socialist construction. We believe that the brave and hardworking Hungarian people will certainly be able to overcome all difficulties in the course of development and push the cause of socialist construction to new and greater victories.
    Over the past five years, the close cooperation between China and Hungary has been continuously strengthened, and the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people has been continuously consolidated. The people of our two countries are enthusiastically engaged in peaceful labor to build our own countries into more prosperous and beautiful lands. At present, the aggressive policies and war provocations of the American imperialist aggressive bloc and its followers are seriously threatening our peaceful construction, threatening world peace and the security of all peoples. The Chinese people resolutely oppose the American aggressive bloc's armed interference in the Chinese people's liberation of their own territory of Taiwan. We fully support the struggle of the Soviet Union and European peace-loving countries against the revival of German militarism. Today is no longer an era in which imperialism can arbitrarily manipulate the fate of the people. With the strong unity of the world peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the powerful Soviet Union, and with the awakening and efforts of all peace-loving and upright people in the world, any war conspiracy of the imperialists is bound to be met with shameful failure.
    As we celebrate this joyous festival of the Hungarian people, I propose a toast: To the prosperity of the Hungarian People's Republic, to the health of the leaders of the Hungarian Working People's Party headed by Comrade Rákosi, and to the health of the leaders of the Hungarian government, to the further strengthening of the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the people of China and Hungary, and to the consolidation and unity of the powerful peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    陈毅副总理的讲话亲爱的大使同志、同志们、朋友们：
    今天是匈牙利解放十周年的光荣节日。在这个盛大的庆祝宴会上，请允许我代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民向您、大使同志，并通过您向匈牙利人民共和国政府和匈牙利人民致衷心的热烈的祝贺。
    解放了的匈牙利人民，在匈牙利劳动人民党和匈牙利人民共和国政府的领导下，在苏联无私的援助下，经过十年辛勤的和创造性的劳动，已经在建设自己新生活的事业中获得了辉煌的成就。光荣的匈牙利人民十年来所经历的道路，是人民民主制度获得巩固的道路、是社会主义经济和民族文化蓬勃发展的道路、是劳动人民生活福利不断增长的道路。匈牙利人民在各方面所获得的成就，加强了以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营，鼓舞了正在从事社会主义建设的中国人民。我们相信：勇敢勤劳的匈牙利人民必定能够克服发展中的一切困难，把社会主义建设事业推向新的更大的胜利。
    五年来，中匈两国的亲密合作已不断加强，中匈人民的兄弟友谊不断巩固。我们两国人民都在热情地进行和平劳动，要把我们自己的祖国建设得更繁荣、更美丽。目前美国帝国主义侵略集团和它的追随者的侵略政策和战争挑衅严重地威胁着我们的和平建设，威胁着世界和平和各国人民的安全。中国人民坚决反对美国侵略集团武装干涉中国人民解放自己的领土台湾。我们完全支持苏联和欧洲爱好和平国家为反对复活德国军国主义所进行的斗争。今天已经不是帝国主义任意摆布人民命运的时代了。有着以强大的苏联为首的世界和平、民主、社会主义阵营的坚强团结，有着全世界爱好和平的正直人民的觉醒和努力，帝国主义者的任何战争阴谋，都一定要遭到可耻的失败。
    当我们庆贺匈牙利人民这个欢乐节日的时候，我提议：为匈牙利人民共和国的繁荣、为以拉科西同志为首的匈牙利劳动人民党领导者们
  的健康和匈牙利政府的领导者们的健康，为中匈两国人民兄弟般的友谊和合作的进一步加
  强、为以苏联为首的强大的和平、民主、社会主义阵营
  的巩固团结而干杯！
