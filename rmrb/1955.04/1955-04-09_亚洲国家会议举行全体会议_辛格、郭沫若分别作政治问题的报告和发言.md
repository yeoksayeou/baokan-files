Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 8th. The Asian Countries Conference held a plenary session on the morning of April 7th at the Imperial Hotel in New Delhi. The meeting was co-chaired by Indian representative and Member of Parliament, Khalilkar, and the head of the Japanese delegation, Matsumoto Jiichiro.

Dr. Anup Singh, former Chief Representative of India to the United Nations Commission on Korea and Member of Parliament, first delivered a report on political issues on behalf of the Indian delegation. (See page 3 for an abstract of the report.)

Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation, then delivered a supplementary speech on political issues on behalf of the Chinese delegation. (See pages 3 and 4 for the speech.)

Bashani, head of the Pakistani delegation, spoke. He said that the Manila Treaty Organization was formed under foreign leadership and was condemned by all Asian countries except for one or two. Bashani fully supported China's claim to Taiwan. He said that the current action of the American rulers in occupying Taiwan is completely illegal. Bashani also supported the principle of peaceful coexistence and pointed out that if Pakistan accepted these principles, the disputes between India and Pakistan would be quickly resolved.

Matsumoto Jiichiro, head of the Japanese delegation, recounted the painful experiences of the Japanese people who were once victims of atomic bombs. He condemned the United States' attempt to establish military bases in Japan and turn Okinawa Island into a permanent American fortress. Matsumoto Jiichiro said that the Japanese people "hope to restore diplomatic relations with some Asian neighbors with whom we have not yet restored diplomatic relations. We also hope to promote the entry of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations; assist in the economic and cultural exchanges of Asia; and establish genuine security based on the unity of Asian countries for peace."

The Soviet representative, the famous writer Korneichuk, spoke at the plenary session, stating that the Soviet Union hoped to establish relations with other countries on the basis of mutual understanding. He said that the Soviet Union's proposal not to use atomic weapons and to use atomic energy for peaceful and constructive purposes reflects the strong desire of the Soviet people to defend the cause of world peace. But such moves by the Soviet Union for peace were considered by the imperialists as "a sign of weakness," and these imperialists continue to threaten with atomic and hydrogen bombs. Western countries disagreed with the Soviet Union's proposal for international supervision of disarmament based on the proposals of Britain and France last year, and resolutely rejected the Soviet Union's proposal.

Korneichuk said that the Soviet people are not afraid of threats. They will work harder to ban atomic weapons. They have full confidence in all peace-loving countries in the world, and they are convinced that the Asian people will support the World Peace Council's call against atomic weapons. He also assured that the Soviet people support the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence announced by China and India.

Syrian parliamentarian Mreiwid stated in his speech that the Arab people are willing to strive for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Mreiwid condemned the attempts of the American rulers to force Arab countries to accept military alliances and treaties. He said: Participating in these treaties is not in line with our national interests, our interests lie in sharing peace with the people of all countries, and their relationship should be based on mutual respect, non-aggression, non-interference, and equality.

Indian representative, Indian Member of Parliament and renowned scientist Dr. Meghnad Saha presented a report on scientific issues and the peaceful use of atomic energy.

Dr. Nguyen Van Huong, head of the Vietnamese delegation, condemned the American imperialists for undermining the Geneva Accords, hindering the restoration of peace in Indochina, further exacerbating international tensions, and intensifying interference in the internal affairs of other countries. He also accused them of establishing aggressive blocs, establishing new aggressive bases, and creating American-style colonialism. Nguyen Van Huong suggested that the conference:
(1) Strongly oppose the actions of the United States in interfering in the internal affairs of Indochina, with the aim of undermining the Geneva Accords; (2) Resolutely demand that the French Federal forces strictly abide by the Geneva ceasefire agreement; (3) Strongly oppose the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc established by the American imperialists in order to undermine Asian peace.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 8th. The Asian Countries Conference continued its plenary session on the afternoon of the 7th. Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation, presided over the meeting.

Representatives from Ceylon, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Lebanon, Jordan, China, Mongolia, and Japan spoke at the afternoon meeting.

Ceylon representative, journalist K. Vikunthavasan, said that the people of Ceylon welcome the trade agreement between China and Ceylon regarding rice and rubber. He pointed out that American imperialists are attempting to interfere in the internal affairs of Ceylon under the pretext of providing economic "aid." He said that the people of Ceylon will oppose the aggressive Manila Treaty Organization with a determination to maintain peace. The people of Ceylon will never allow the imperialists to use Asians to fight Asians.

The whole audience warmly welcomed the speech by Park Jung-ai, head of the Korean delegation. Park Jung-ai said that the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea is not only a matter of concern to the Korean people who are eager for peaceful reunification of their homeland, but also a matter of concern to the Asian and world people who are concerned about maintaining and consolidating peace in Asia. The United States and the countries that follow it disregarded the national interests of the Korean people and unilaterally ended the Geneva Conference. However, the Korean issue has not and cannot be erased from the agenda. The Korean issue is the most urgent issue that must be resolved at present.

Park Jung-ai said that in order to comprehensively resolve the Korean issue, an international conference with broad participation of relevant countries should be convened soon. The reunification of Korea should be peacefully realized by the Koreans themselves on a democratic basis. On October 30, 1954, the Eighth Session of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued an appeal to all Korean people demanding the acceleration of the peaceful reunification of Korea, and suggested that representatives from North and South Korea hold a meeting within 1955. This appeal expressed the unanimous will of the Korean people. However, the Syngman Rhee clique disregarded the wishes of all the Korean people and suppressed all activities of the South Korean people to strive for the peaceful reunification of Korea. Syngman Rhee and the American troops in South Korea openly violated the armistice agreement, massively expanded their armaments, and clamored for war. The United States and the Syngman Rhee clique concluded the so-called "U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty" in 1953 in order to allow American troops to occupy South Korea indefinitely. Later, a memorandum on military and economic assistance between South Korea and the United States was signed, using South Korean economy subordinate to the United States and driving South Korean residents to war. In order to legalize the acts of violating the armistice agreement, the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique openly attempted to disband the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and they even threatened the members of this committee.

Park Jung-ai said that the occupation of South Korea by American troops is a blatant interference in the internal affairs of Korea and constitutes a major factor hindering the reunification of Korea. The Korean people can only reunify Korea and form a unified democratic country when it is possible to resolve issues related to their own destiny without external interference.

Park Jung-ai finally represented all the Korean people and suggested that the Asian Countries Conference adopt a resolution including the following points to accelerate the peaceful reunification of Korea:
	1. Convene an international conference to resolve the Korean issue as soon as possible, and relevant countries, especially Asian countries, should participate widely in this conference.
    2. Reaffirm the principle that the issue of Korean national reunification should be resolved by the Koreans themselves.
    3. Withdraw all foreign troops from Korea as soon as possible.
    4. Abide by the Korean Armistice Agreement and immediately stop the United States' actions of expanding armaments in South Korea, which constitute the danger of another war in Korea.

Lebanese former minister and chairman of the Socialist Progressive Party, Kamal Joumblatt, then spoke. Joumblatt condemned imperialism for interfering in the internal affairs of Arab countries through military treaties, and placing them under the servitude of new colonial bondage through economic and military "aid."

Jordanian representative and Member of the Jordanian Parliament, Abdul Kader Al-Saleh, spoke, accusing Western countries of oppressing and exploiting the Asian people. He said, "We cannot but express our great joy at the realization of a long-cherished hope, which is that Asians from all parts of the vast Asian continent have finally gathered in one place to realize a wish, which is also everyone's wish - Asians resist aggression and resist interference. The same sentence that has spread everywhere is: do not interfere in Asia."

Saifuddin, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China and representative of the Chinese Uyghur nationality, spoke at the meeting on the Asian people's movement against atomic weapons. Saifuddin said: The atomic blackmail and threats of the American aggressive clique have seriously aggravated international tensions. He said that peace-loving people from all countries in the world have launched a signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons. He said: The Chinese people resolutely oppose the use of atomic weapons, and enthusiastically signed the World Peace Council Standing Committee's appeal to the people of the world against the use of atomic weapons.

Saifuddin called on all honest people in the world to jointly condemn atomic maniacs like Radford and Dulles. Saifuddin asked the delegates to pay attention to the fact that atomic blackmail is directed against the Asian people. He also pointed out that some war-mongers, in violation of the Japanese people's desire for peace, are attempting to turn Japan into an American atomic base.

Saifuddin said that the Chinese people have always pursued a peaceful policy, and the Chinese people will never be intimidated by the war threats of American imperialist elements. The Chinese people firmly oppose the use of atomic energy for destructive purposes, but enthusiastically welcome its use for peaceful purposes.

Saifuddin praised the brilliant achievements of the Soviet Union in the peaceful use of atomic energy. He said: "Thanks to the Soviet Union's technical assistance, the Chinese people, who are engaged in peaceful construction, will make further progress in atomic energy research and will also master the science and technology of using atomic energy to serve our socialist construction."

Saifuddin finally called for further development of the movement of people of all countries against the use of atomic weapons, so as to further isolate atomic maniacs and war-mongers, making it difficult for them to conduct atomic weapon tests, establish atomic bases, and launch any atomic war on Asian soil.

Jagvaral Nyam, head of the Mongolian delegation, said that the true purpose of the Manila Treaty Organization is to suppress Asian countries. He welcomed the efforts made by some countries to strive for peace and the easing of international tensions.

Japanese representative and professor at the University of Tokyo, Goroh Tominaga (transliteration), condemned the American atomic war policy at the meeting and exposed the American conspiracy to obstruct the peaceful use of atomic energy.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 8th. The Asian Countries Conference continued its plenary session on the morning of the 8th. When discussing political issues, the meeting was chaired by Dr. Dawalibi, Syrian representative and Member of Parliament. Representatives from Japan, India, Egypt, and Korea spoke. When discussing economic issues, the meeting was chaired by Tikhonov, head of the Soviet delegation. Representatives from Japan, Ceylon, the Soviet Union, and China spoke.

    亚洲国家会议举行全体会议
    辛格、郭沫若分别作政治问题的报告和发言
    新华社新德里八日电　亚洲国家会议四月七日上午在新德里帝国饭店举行全体会议。会议由印度代表、国会议员卡里尔卡和日本代表团团长松本治一郎轮流担任主席。
    前印度驻联合国朝鲜委员会首席代表、国会议员阿努普·辛格博士首先代表印度代表团作了关于政治问题的报告。（报告摘要见第三版）
    中国代表团团长郭沫若接着代表中国代表团作了关于政治问题的补充发言。（发言见第三、四版）
    巴基斯坦代表团团长巴沙尼发言。他说，马尼拉条约组织是在外国领导下组成的，而且受到除一两个国家外全体亚洲国家的谴责。巴沙尼完全支持中国对台湾的要求。他说，美国统治者目前占领台湾的行动是完全非法的。巴沙尼还支持和平共处的原则，并指出，如果巴基斯坦接受这些原则，印度和巴基斯坦之间的纠纷将会迅速得到解决。
    日本代表团团长松本治一郎叙述了曾经是原子弹的牺牲者的日本人民的惨痛经验。他谴责美国企图在日本建立军事基地和变冲绳岛为美国永久性的要塞。松本治一郎说，日本人民“希望同一些还没有与之恢复外交关系的亚洲邻国恢复外交关系。我们还希望促进中华人民共和国进入联合国；协助亚洲的经济和文化的交流；并为在亚洲国家团结一致的基础上的和平，建立真正的安全。”
    苏联代表、著名的作家考涅楚克在全体会议上发言，表明苏联希望在相互了解的基础上和其他国家建立关系。他说，苏联提出的不使用原子武器和把原子能用于和平和建设用途的建议，反映了苏联人民对保卫世界和平事业的强烈愿望。但是苏联为了和平而采取的这种举动却被帝国主义分子认为是
  “软弱的表示”，这些帝国主义者继续以原子弹和氢弹来进行威胁。西方国家不同意苏联根据去年英法两国的建议而提出的关于国际监督裁军的建议，断然地拒绝了苏联的建议。
    考涅楚克说，苏联人民是不怕威胁的。他们将更加努力地来争取禁止原子武器。他们对全世界爱好和平的国家具有充分的信心，他们深信，亚洲人民将会支持世界和平理事会的反对原子武器的号召。他还保证苏联人民支持中国和印度所宣布的和平共处的五项原则。
    叙利亚议员姆雷维德在发言中表示阿拉伯人民愿意为和平共处的五项原则而努力奋斗。姆雷维德谴责美国统治者们想要强迫阿拉伯国家接受军事联盟和条约的企图。他说：参加这些条约是不符合我们国家利益的，我们的利益是在于同各国人民共享和平，它们之间的关系应该是建立在互相尊重、互不侵犯、互不干涉和平等的基础之上的。
    印度代表、印度国会议员和著名科学家麦格纳德·萨哈博士提出了关于科学问题及和平使用原子能的报告。
    越南代表团团长阮文向博士谴责美帝国主义者破坏日内瓦协定，阻挠印度支那和平的恢复，进一步加剧国际紧张局势并加强对其他国家内政的干涉。他并指责他们建立侵略集团、建立新的侵略基地和制造美国式的殖民主义。阮文向建议会议：
  （一）强烈反对美国干涉印度支那的内政的行动，这种干涉的目的在于破坏日内瓦协定；（二）坚决要求法兰西联邦军队严格遵守日内瓦停战协定；（三）强烈反对美帝国主义者为了破坏亚洲和平而建立的东南亚侵略集团。
    新华社新德里八日电　亚洲国家会议七日下午继续举行全体会议。中国代表团团长郭沫若担任主席。
    在下午的会议上发言的有锡兰、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、黎巴嫩、约旦、中国、蒙古和日本等国的代表。
    锡兰代表、记者克·维昆塔瓦桑发言说，锡兰人民欢迎中国和锡兰关于大米和橡胶的贸易协定。他指出，美国帝国主义者正企图借口提供经济
  “援助”来干涉锡兰的内政。他说，锡兰人民将本着维护和平的决心来反对侵略性的马尼拉条约组织。锡兰人民决不容许帝国主义者用亚洲人打亚洲人。
    全场热烈欢迎朝鲜代表团团长朴正爱的发言。朴正爱说，和平统一朝鲜的问题，不但是渴望祖国和平统一的朝鲜人民关心的问题，也是关心维持和巩固亚洲和平的亚洲和全世界人民关心的问题。美国及追随它的国家，无视朝鲜人民的民族利益，片面地结束了日内瓦会议。但是，朝鲜问题并没有也不能够从议程上抹掉。朝鲜问题是当前必须予以解决的最迫切的问题。
    朴正爱说，为了全面解决朝鲜问题，应当很快就召开由有关各国广泛参加的国际会议。朝鲜的统一应当由朝鲜人自己在民主的基础上和平地予以实现。一九五四年十月三十日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议第八届会议向全朝鲜人民发出了要求加速和平统一朝鲜的呼吁，并建议南北朝鲜的代表们在一九五五年内举行会议。这个呼吁表示了朝鲜人民的一致意志。可是，李承晚集团却不顾朝鲜全体人民的愿望，镇压南朝鲜人民争取朝鲜和平统一的一切活动。李承晚和南朝鲜的美国军队公然违反停战协定，大量扩充军备，叫嚣战争。美国和李承晚集团在一九五三年缔结了所谓“美韩共同防御条约”，以便让美国军队无限期占领南朝鲜。以后，又签订了使用南朝鲜经济从属于美国并把南朝鲜居民驱向战争的南朝鲜和美国关于军事和经济援助的备忘录。美国和李承晚集团为了使违犯停战协定的行为合法化，竟公然企图解散中立国监察委员会，他们甚至对这个委员会的委员进行威胁。
    朴正爱说，美国军队占领南朝鲜，是公然干涉朝鲜内政，形成阻挠朝鲜重新统一的主要因素。朝鲜人民只有在有可能不受外界干涉而自行解决关系本身命运的问题的时候，才能够重新统一朝鲜而组成统一民主的国家。
    朴正爱最后代表全体朝鲜人民，建议亚洲国家会议通过包括下列各点的决议，以加速实现朝鲜的和平统一。
      一、尽速召开解决朝鲜问题的国际会议，有关国家，特别是亚洲国家，应当广泛参加这个会议。
    二、重申朝鲜国家统一问题应当让朝鲜人自己去解决的原则。
    三、尽早从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队。
    四、遵守朝鲜停战协定，并立即制止美国在南朝鲜进行的扩张军备的行动——它构成朝鲜发生另一次战争的危险。
    黎巴嫩前部长、社会主义进步党主席卡马尔·佐米拉特接着发言。佐米拉特斥责帝国主义通过军事条约对阿拉伯国家内政进行干涉，并通过经济和军事“援助”使它们处于新的殖民束缚的奴役之下。
    约旦代表、约旦议会议员阿卜杜勒·卡德尔·赛勒发言指责西方国家压迫和剥削亚洲人民。他说，我们不能不表示我们对长期怀有的希望的实现感到极大的欢欣，这个希望就是从巨大的亚洲大陆各地来的亚洲人终于在一个地方聚会来实现一个愿望，也是大家的愿望——亚洲人反抗侵略和反抗干涉。传遍各地的同一句话就是不要干涉亚洲。
    中国全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、中国维吾尔族代表赛福鼎在会上就亚洲人民反对原子武器的运动作了发言。赛福鼎说：美国侵略集团的原子讹诈和威胁严重地加剧了国际紧张局势。他说，全世界各国爱好和平的人民已经发动了反对使用原子武器的签名运动。他说：中国人民坚决反对使用原子武器，并且热烈地在世界和平理事会常务委员会反对使用原子武器的告全世界人民书上签名。
    赛福鼎号召世界上一切正直的人们一齐来斥责像雷德福和杜勒斯之流的原子狂人。赛福鼎要求代表们注意这个事实：原子讹诈是针对亚洲人民而发的。他还指出，某些好战分子违反日本人民要求和平的愿望，正企图把日本变为美国的原子基地。
    赛福鼎说，中国人民一贯执行和平政策，中国人民绝不会被美帝国主义分子的战争威胁所吓倒。中国人民坚决反对把原子能用于破坏的目的，而是热烈欢迎把它用于和平的目的。
    赛福鼎赞扬苏联在和平使用原子能上所获得的光辉成就。他说：“由于苏联在技术方面的帮助，正从事和平建设的中国人民在原子能的研究工作上将有进一步的进展，而且还将掌握利用原子能的科学和技术来为我们的社会主义建设服务。”
    赛福鼎最后号召进一步开展各国人民反对使用原子武器的运动，使原子狂人和战争贩子更陷于孤立，使他们难于在亚洲的土地上进行原子武器的试验、建立原子基地和发动任何原子战争。
    蒙古代表团团长雅格瓦拉尔·尼姆说，马尼拉条约组织的真正目的就是镇压亚洲国家。他表示欢迎一些国家为争取和平和国际紧张局势的缓和而作的努力。
    日本代表、东京大学教授富永五郎（译音）在会上斥责美国的原子战争政策，并且揭发了美国阻挠和平使用原子能的阴谋。
    新华社新德里八日电　亚洲国家会议在八日上午继续举行全体会议。会议在讨论政治问题时由叙利亚代表、议会议员达瓦利比博士担任主席。发言的有日本、印度、埃及和朝鲜的代表。在讨论经济问题时由苏联代表团团长吉洪诺夫担任主席。发言的有日本、锡兰、苏联和中国的代表。
