The Tai County area is one of the key pig-producing regions in Jiangsu Province. The pigs produced in the Jiangnian area of Tai County have small heads, slender legs, glossy black hair, and appear plump with meat. In order to purchase these fat pigs from thousands of households and transport them in batches to various regions to supply urban residents and meet national export needs, the China Food Company system established a purchasing station in the Jiangnian area, which successfully completed its procurement plan.

People engaged in the live pig business often say that live pigs are both delicate and clumsy, making them difficult to manage. Furthermore, the production and sales situation is constantly changing, making planning difficult to control. Feeding, storage, and transportation are also significant challenges, and assessing quality and specifications is not easy. However, the Jiangnian purchasing station overcame these difficulties and completed 123.38% of its annual live pig procurement plan last year. The monthly completion rate of the plan was also generally balanced.

The reason for exceeding the procurement plan is primarily due to the establishment and implementation of an investigation and research system, which allowed them to understand the production and sales of pigs. At the end of each month, the Jiangnian purchasing station sends cadres to rural areas to conduct typical investigations, determine the pig production volume, and then, after discussion, preliminarily determine the possible listing figures and the purchasable figures. After approval by the higher authorities, the trade union mobilizes the masses for discussion. In this way, the plan is integrated with the actual actions of each employee, and each employee strives for the procurement figures proposed by themselves and approved by the higher authorities. Under normal circumstances, the volume of live pigs on the market generally matches the plan. However, due to seasonal, climatic, and other changes, difficulties in completing the plan may still occur. In this situation, they promptly organized mobile purchases. For example, in April and May of last year, due to a shortage of feed, the number of large pigs in rural areas decreased. They went deep into the countryside, visiting homes to make purchases, mobilizing farmers to sell the large pigs that could be sold early to the state, and purchasing pigs that had been pre-ordered and subscribed to ahead of schedule. Last year, they conducted mobile purchases in rural areas five times, purchasing a total of 2,919 pigs. In the third quarter of last year, farmers in general disaster areas rushed to sell pigs. The Jiangnian area was not a severely affected area, so purchases should have been slowed down and reduced to address the difficulties faced by farmers in severely affected areas first. They promptly launched a publicity campaign to explain the reasons for slowing down and reducing purchases to farmers. After explaining the reasons, the farmers continued to raise the pigs that were not yet fat enough and postponed their sale, alleviating the situation of excessive live pig market supply.

The Jiangnian purchasing station paid close attention to organizing the source of goods. Last year, they signed a contract with the Tai County Farm, and the farm sold 27 live pigs within six months. In addition, their relationship with the cooperatives was also very close. Last year, they established a purchasing agency relationship with three cooperatives. The amount of live pigs purchased by these three cooperatives accounted for more than 23% of their total purchases. To help the cooperatives formulate a good procurement plan, after each investigation of pig production volume, they notified the cooperative agents of the number of pigs in their business scope and how many could be purchased. In order to improve the technical level of the weighers responsible for live pig purchases at the entrusted purchasing cooperatives, they convened them every two weeks to exchange experiences in mastering quality specifications, and sometimes even helped the weighers understand the quality specifications specifically through actual trial slaughtering. Some cooperatives had only one weigher. When the weigher went to the meeting, no one was in charge of weighing at the cooperative, so the purchasing station sent someone to replace them to attend the meeting.

In order to reduce the incidence of illness and death of pigs, the Jiangnian purchasing station often used local real-life stories to publicize to farmers the benefits of raising pigs for the country and for themselves, and the necessity of improving the sanitary conditions of pig pens. They also paid great attention to the feeding of the pigs purchased. The head of the purchasing station often personally inspected the cleanliness and hygiene of the pig pens.

The Jiangnian purchasing station attached great importance to the transportation of live pigs and had achieved significant results. For example, escort Wang Huajiang, from July 1953 to the end of 1954, in eighteen months, escorted 14,989 live pigs from Jiangnian to Xingang 99 times, without a single death. Escort Dou Jinyu, from July last year to February 15 this year, successively escorted 6,264 live pigs, also without a single death. There were five escorts who frequently created transportation safety months.

As a result of paying attention to live pig feeding and transportation, the loss rate of live pigs was greatly reduced. Last year, a total of 45 pigs died, accounting for 0.038% of the total purchases. Pigs slaughtered urgently accounted for 0.0276% of total purchases.

The Jiangnian purchasing station was able to achieve the above remarkable results because the employees loved their work, were actively responsible, and had a thoughtful service attitude. For example, on a rainy night at the end of September last year, six farmers used a small boat to transport four pigs for sale, and each of them was drenched in the rain and shivering with cold. When they arrived, the purchasing station had already closed, but the feeder Yang Chungui and others quickly helped the farmers unload the pigs from the boat and put them in the pig pen, and comforted the farmers, saying, "It's dark and raining. Stay here! We'll weigh them for you first thing tomorrow morning." They also helped the farmers dry their clothes. The farmers said with emotion, "You are really good cadres of Chairman Mao."

    姜埝收购站是怎样完成生猪收购计划的
    纪安礼　刘广志
    泰县是江苏省的重点产猪区之一。泰县姜埝一带所产的猪，都是小头细脚、毛光乌亮，看上去肉滚滚的。为了把这些肥猪从千家万户收购进来，成批地运到各地，供应城市居民消费和国家出口的需要，中国食品公司系统特在姜埝地方设立了收购站，并且很好地完成了收购计划。
    经营活猪的人经常说：活猪既娇且笨，不好经营，加上产销情况多变，计划不好掌握，饲养保管运输都有很大困难，鉴别质量规格也不容易。但是，姜埝收购站却克服了这些困难，去年全年生猪收购计划完成了百分之一百二十三点三八。并且每月完成计划的情况也基本上是均衡的。
    超额完成收购计划的原因首先是由于他们建立了和贯彻了调查研究制度，掌握了猪的产销情况。每月月底，姜埝收购站都抽出干部深入到农村进行典型调查，摸清生猪产量，然后经大家讨论初步议定可能上市数字和可购数字，经上级批准后，再由工会发动群众讨论。这样，计划就和每一职工的实际行动结合起来，每一个职工都要为自己所提出的并为上级所批准的收购数字而努力。在正常情况下，生猪上市量一般是和计划符合的。但是，由于季节、气候和其他情况的变化，有时完成计划仍会发生困难。在这种情况下，他们就及时组织流动收购。如去年四、五月份，由于饲料缺乏，农村大猪减少，他们就深入农村，登门收购，动员农民把可能提前出售的大猪卖给国家，并把预购、订购的猪提前收购。去年一年内，他们曾五次深入农村进行流动收购，一共买进了两千九百十九头猪。去年第三季度，一般灾区的农民都争先售猪，姜埝地方不是重灾区，应该缓收和减少收购数量，先解决重灾区农民的困难。他们就及时展开宣传，对农民说明缓收和减少收购数量的道理，在讲明道理后，农民就把还不够肥的猪再饲养，暂缓出售，缓和了生猪上市过多的局面。
    姜埝收购站很注意组织货源工作。去年他们就同泰县农场订了合同，六个月内，农场就出售了二十七头生猪。另外，他们同合作社的关系也很密切。去年他们同三个合作社建立了代购关系，这三个合作社收购的生猪量占他们收购总数的百分之二十三以上。为了帮助合作社订好收购计划，他们每次下去调查生猪产量回来后，都把他们经营范围内有多少猪，能收购多少等情况通知委托代购的合作社。为了提高委托代购的合作社负责生猪收购的司秤员的技术水平，每两个星期就召集他们开一次会，交流掌握质量规格的经验，有时还通过实际试宰来具体帮助司秤员了解质量规格。有的合作社只有一个司秤员，司秤员去开会社里就没有人掌秤，收购站就派人去替换他们来开会。
    为了减少猪的生病和死亡现象，姜埝收购站经常通过当地的真人真事，向农民宣传养猪对国家对自己的好处，和改善猪圈卫生条件的必要。他们对于收购进来的猪也非常重视饲养工作。收购站站长还经常亲自到猪圈里检查猪圈的清洁卫生情况。
    姜埝收购站十分重视生猪的运输工作，并已得到了显著的成绩。如押运员王华江，从一九五三年七月到一九五四年底的十八个月当中，从姜埝到新港九十九次，共押运了一万四千九百八十九头生猪，无一死亡。押运员窦金裕从去年七月到今年二月十五日，先后押运了六千二百六十四头生猪，也无一死亡。有五个押运员，经常创造运输安全月。
    重视生猪饲养和运输工作的结果，使生猪损耗率大大降低。去年全年共死了四十五头猪，占收购总量的万分之三点八。急宰的占收购量的万分之二十七点六。
    姜埝收购站所以能获得上述显著成绩，是和职工们热爱自己的工作积极负责以及周到的服务态度分不开的。如去年九月底一个下着大雨的晚上，有六个农民用条小船装来四只生猪出售，每人身上都被雨淋得透湿，冷得发抖。赶到时收购站早已下班了，但饲养员杨春贵等连忙帮助农民把猪从船上卸下来放进猪圈，并安慰农民们说：“天黑了，又下着雨，你们在这儿住下吧！明天一大早就替你们先过秤。”还帮助农民烤干了衣服。农民感动地说：“真是毛主席的好干部。”
