The Superiority of Being Organized

    By the end of 1954, Chengdu had established twenty-two handicraft production cooperatives. After a period of consolidation and improvement, these cooperatives have shown varying degrees of superiority from being organized.

    Due to the organization and the implementation of preliminary division of labor and cooperation, and the relatively reasonable organization of the labor force, the work efficiency of each person has generally increased by more than 30% compared with the original decentralized production. A prominent example is the members of the leather goods production cooperative, whose efficiency has increased an average of two times compared to when they worked independently. The members of the knife and scissors production cooperative have increased their efficiency by an average of 70% compared to when they worked independently. In 1954, the average output value of members of the knife and scissors production cooperative was 1,032 yuan per year, while the highest average output value of scattered handicraft workers was only 600 yuan per year. Due to the collective handling of materials and the preliminary establishment of some inspection systems, materials were saved, waste products were reduced, and costs were lowered. The cost of cloth shoes produced by the cloth shoe production cooperative was 6.74% lower than when they were produced in a decentralized manner, and the waste product rate dropped from 5% to 0.3%. All cooperatives, due to batch production and consistent specifications, have found it easier to establish relatively fixed production and sales relationships with external sales areas and state-owned commercial enterprises, thereby improving production planning. This not only eliminated the intermediate exploitation by private merchants but also overcame the abnormal phenomenon of peak and off-seasons in decentralized production. Because the production of cooperatives has developed, each cooperative has now accumulated a certain amount of public property, with the silk weaving production cooperative having accumulated more than 52,000 yuan. The income of members of production cooperatives has also increased, with the average monthly income of each person being about 11% higher than that of scattered producers in the same industry. The income of members of the cloth shoe production cooperative is 16% higher than that of scattered producers in the same industry; the income of members of the silk weaving production cooperative is 15.5% higher. At the same time, with the development of production, the political and cultural study system and the technical research system of the cooperatives have also been established. According to the statistics of eleven old cooperatives, more than 96% of the members are currently participating in spare-time political and cultural school studies, which enables the members to continuously improve in political, cultural, and technical aspects.

    Eliminating the Concerns of Handicraft Workers

    Building a cooperative and running it well is not something that can be accomplished overnight or easily; it requires a series of complex ideological struggles and meticulous and arduous work.

    Participating in a production cooperative is a moment of great transformation in the production and life of handicraft workers. When they are about to join a production cooperative, handicraft workers invariably have to consider many issues and have some concerns. Because for many years, they have been using a family household as the production unit, relying on some simple production tools and a small amount of capital to make and sell some products to maintain their lives. Now they are going to participate in collective production, which is a big turning point and cannot but cause ideological struggle. After extensively promoting the state's general task during the transition period in the handicraft industry last year, we began to consider organizing cooperatives in key industries and found that the main concerns of general handicraft workers were five: First, is organized production better than independent work? Is the income higher than independent work? The main consideration and calculation in this issue is whether their auxiliary labor can be included in the cooperative and how much it can be included; second, how to deal with tools, how to appraise their value, and how long is the repayment period? Third, how to deal with funds and raw materials? Fourth, how to produce collectively, is it free? Fifth, what is the difference in treatment for different technical levels?

    The sewing production cooperative, among others, has done a better job of resolving these ideological concerns by mainly doing the following tasks: (1) Conducting a preliminary investigation of the industry's supply, production, and sales situation, investigating the wage income of practitioners and the general ideological trends of handicraft workers, and making comparisons. (2) Explaining the direction and policies of the transformation of the handicraft industry, and using examples to illustrate the advantages of being organized. (3) Organizing handicraft workers to visit old cooperatives. (4) When organizing the study of the cooperative's charter, presenting the specific problems of joining the cooperative and helping the learners calculate carefully and make comparisons. (5) Presenting the handling principles and then letting everyone discuss them repeatedly several times. As a result of doing so, the members' emotions are more stable after joining the cooperative. On the contrary, some cooperatives did not investigate and study before organizing, were reluctant to repeatedly discuss the matter, crudely formulated some methods for handling tools, funds, and personnel joining the cooperative, or forced the adoption of the cooperative's charter. As a result, they all took detours and had to make up for the lessons.

    The Board of Directors Must Seize the Initiative to Lead Production in a Timely Manner

    In the early stages of building a cooperative, generally speaking, the members' thoughts are more complex, and there are many problems that need to be dealt with. During this period, some boards of directors are often busy grasping trivial affairs, so the cooperative seems very chaotic, and the members' emotions are also very unstable. However, from the perspective of several cooperatives that have developed better, if the board of directors of the cooperative can seize the initiative to lead production in a timely manner and achieve results during this period, it will play an important role in consolidating the members' emotions and will also facilitate the promotion of future work. After the knife and scissors production cooperative was built, the board of directors first discussed and tried to solve a batch of raw material problems, and then studied the reasonable organization of labor and the arrangement of work procedures. It also mobilized members to discuss several labor disciplines, so work efficiency increased by about 10% soon after the start of production, and waste products were also reduced. The board of directors announced these achievements to all members in a timely manner, which boosted the members' emotions. On this basis, they organized forces to further study the issue of division of labor and cooperation, and first successfully implemented it in the red furnace process, and gradually promoted it to other processes, thereby increasing work efficiency by 76.9% and reducing costs by 14%. In this way, the production morale in the cooperative was high, and various systems were easy to implement. Member Fu Keming also sold his best steel file to the cooperative. He said: "I used to keep it hidden as a backup, but now I don't need it." This shows that the greater the achievements of the cooperative in production, the higher the members' emotions, and the more the members' hearts are turned toward the cooperative.

    Always Be Vigilant Against the Sabotage of Bad Elements

    Chengdu proposed "Do not let bad people join the cooperative" and "Do not let capitalists join the cooperative" from the time it established cooperatives. However, bad elements and illegal capitalists always try to find many ways to mix into the cooperative, or maintain contact with the cooperative. The cotton weaving production cooperative and the leather goods production cooperative have been infiltrated by people who concealed their identities. The silk weaving production cooperative and other cooperatives were also once very closely related to merchants who collected goods at high prices. After bad elements and illegal capitalists infiltrated the cooperative or established contact with the cooperative, they sabotaged the cooperative or organized small groups within the cooperative to attack activists; or used their power to engage in corruption; or spread rumors, deliberately provoking the relationship between the grassroots cooperative and the joint cooperative, and the cooperative and state-owned commercial enterprises, and even usurped the leadership of the cooperative. Therefore, the cooperative must strictly pay attention to the purity of the team and be very vigilant to have proper relations with private merchants. Any carelessness or thoughts of greed for petty gains will become loopholes for bad elements and illegal capitalists to sabotage the cooperative.

    Overcoming Capitalist Ideology and Spontaneous Tendencies

    The basic problem of consolidating and gradually improving handicraft production cooperatives lies in constantly overcoming the capitalist ideology and the spontaneous tendencies of small producers within the cooperative. Judging from the work of inspecting eleven old cooperatives last year, the influence of capitalist ideology on the cooperative and the manifestations of the spontaneous tendencies of small producers are various: The cotton weaving production cooperative and the silk weaving production cooperative have been systematically and intentionally falsely reporting production costs for a long time. When the market sales improved, they deliberately raised many difficult problems and demanded that the state-owned trading company solve them, refused the state-owned trading company to inspect the product quality according to the standards, did not want to process for the state-owned trading company, and were very closely related to private merchants. In order to obtain high profits, these cooperatives organized members to work overtime to rush to make goods for private merchants. The leather goods production cooperative deliberately used large materials for small purposes when processing raw materials for state-owned trading companies, and the remaining materials were owned by the cooperative, resulting in serious waste, and used bad leather to exchange for good leather, and the number of workers hired reached 70% of the total number of members. In addition, there are also many cases of disunity among cadres, arrogance and complacency, and corruption in some cooperatives; in terms of production, they generally shouted that work efficiency and quality have "reached the top," and some cooperatives arbitrarily and blindly increased wages by more than double, and so on.

    To reverse this situation, it is necessary to (1) mobilize the members of the cooperative to extensively expose the ugly facts of capitalist ideology and behavior based on the problems existing in the cooperative, and point out the temptation and harm of capitalist ideology to the cooperative. (2) Select typical examples and constantly criticize capitalist ideology. (3) Propose rectification methods and implement them. (4) On the basis of these tasks, launch a rationalization proposal campaign, and then move to a labor competition. Facts have proved that after this series of work, the political ideology of the members will be improved. Therefore, after the cooperative is built, it is necessary to pay attention to strengthening political and ideological work, promptly conduct a serious struggle against capitalist ideology, and actively establish socialist ideology, otherwise the consolidation of the cooperative is impossible.

    Pay Attention to Training and Improving Cadres

    Training and improving the cadres of the cooperative is very important for the growth of the cooperative. Most of the cooperative's cadres are active and enthusiastic, which is good. However, it is also quite common that they do not have a deep understanding of the principles and policies of handicraft cooperation, cannot grasp the principle of voluntary mutual benefit well, cannot lead production in running the cooperative, and cannot manage democratically. Therefore, they inevitably have situations in which they are not capable of handling the work or make mistakes in handling problems. Therefore, it is necessary to actively carry out patient training for them. The methods of training, such as: opening short-term training courses, organizing working groups to assist the cooperative, holding seminars to exchange experiences, leading comrades to participate in the cooperative's meetings to inspect work, and running spare-time schools, etc. However, Chengdu lacks systematic research and deployment of these tasks. For example, training courses are only held before the establishment of the cooperative or before the central work, and a system of rotation training has not been gradually established; seminars to exchange experiences are only conducted among a few cooperatives, and are not done frequently; the experience and lessons learned by the working group in the key cooperatives have not been promptly promoted, etc. With the gradual development of handicraft production cooperatives, and the more detailed and complex work of the cooperatives, it is very important to seize this work. Only by continuously and massively training cadres who love their work, are selfless, technically skilled, and are supported by the masses can the development and consolidation of the cooperative be guaranteed.

    组织手工业生产合作社遇到的问题
    廖家岷
    组织起来的优越性
    到一九五四年底，成都市已建立起二十二个手工业生产合作社。这些合作社经过了一段巩固提高工作后，都显示出不同程度的组织起来的优越性。
    由于组织起来，实行了初步的分工协作，较合理地组织了劳动力，所以每个人的工作效率，一般都比原来分散生产时提高了百分之三十以上。比较突出的如皮件生产合作社的社员，更是比单干时平均提高了两倍。刀剪生产合作社的社员比单干时平均提高了百分之七十。刀剪生产合作社社员一九五四年一年平均产值为一千零三十二元，而分散的手工工人一年平均产值最高只有六百元。由于集体处理材料和初步建立了一些检查制度，节省了材料，减少了废品，降低了成本。布鞋生产合作社的布鞋成本比原分散生产时降低百分之六点七四，废品由百分之五降为千分之三。所有的合作社都因成批生产而规格一致，所以便于跟外面销售地区和国营商业建立较固定的产销关系，相应地提高了生产的计划性。这不仅消除了私商的中间剥削，而且克服了分散生产时淡旺季不正常的现象。因为合作社的生产发展了，所以现在各个社都积累了一定的公共财产，其中丝织生产合作社已积累到五万二千余元。生产合作社社员的收入也增加了，一般每人每月的收入比同行业中分散的生产者多百分之十一左右。布鞋生产合作社社员的收入比同行业中分散的生产者多百分之十六；丝织生产合作社社员多百分之十五点五。同时，随着生产的发展，合作社的政治文化学习制度和技术研究制度也建立起来了。据十一个老社统计，目前有百分之九十六以上的社员参加了业余政治文化学校学习，从而使社员在政治文化和技术方面得到不断提高。
      解除手工业劳动者的顾虑
    建成一个合作社和办好一个合作社不是一蹴而成，轻而易举的事情，而是要经过一系列的复杂的思想斗争和若干细致艰巨的工作的。
    参加生产合作社是手工业者在生产上和生活上发生巨大转变的时刻。在即将参加生产合作社的时候，手工业劳动者无例外是要考虑许多问题和产生若干顾虑的。因为多少年的传统，他们都是以一家一户为生产单位，依靠一些简单的生产工具和微少的资金，自己制作一些产品和出卖这些产品来维持生活的，现在要参加集体生产，这是很大的转折，不能不引起思想斗争。去年在手工业行业中广泛展开国家在过渡时期总任务的宣传后，就在重点行业中酝酿组织合作社，发现一般手工业劳动者的主要顾虑有五个：第一是组织起来生产是不是比单干好？收入是不是比单干多？在这一问题中又主要是考虑和计算他们的辅助劳动能不能入社和能入多少的问题；第二，工具怎样处理，怎样作价，还款期多长？第三，资金原料怎样处理？第四，怎样集体生产，自由不自由？第五，技术高低不同，待遇有什么不同？
    解决这些思想顾虑较好的如缝纫生产合作社等，主要做了以下几项工作：（一）事先调查行业的供、产、销等情况，调查从业人员的工资收入及一般手工业劳动者的思想动向，并排队比较。（二）讲清手工业改造的方向和政策，并用实例说明组织起来的优越性。（三）组织手工业者到老合作社去参观。（四）组织学习社章时摆开入社中的具体问题，帮助学习者算细账、对比。（五）提出处理原则后再让大家反复讨论几次。这样做的结果，社员入社后的情绪也较为稳定。相反的，有些社在组织前，不调查研究，嫌反复讨论麻烦，粗糙地拟定一些工具资金及人员入社的处理办法，或勉强通过社章，其结果都走了弯路，必须进行补课。
      理事会要及时抓紧领导生产
    合作社建成之初，一般说来社员的思想是较复杂的，而且需要处理的问题又是很多。在这一段时期，往往有些理事会是忙于抓零碎事务工作，因而社内显得很混乱，社员情绪也很不安定。但是从几个发展较好的合作社来看，这时候，社的理事会如能及时抓紧领导生产，做出成绩来，对巩固社员情绪有着重要作用，同时也便于推动以后的工作。刀剪生产合作社建成后，理事会首先就讨论并设法解决了一批原料问题，随即研究了合理组织劳动力和工序安排问题。并发动社员讨论了几条劳动纪律，因之在开始生产不久工效就提高了百分之十左右，废品也减少了。理事会及时向全体社员宣布了这些成绩，提高了社员的情绪。在此基础上，他们又组织了力量，进一步具体研究分工协作的问题，并首先在红炉一道工序上试行成功，逐步在其他工序上得到推广，因而提高工效百分之七十六点九，降低成本百分之十四。这样，社内生产情绪高涨，各种制度也易于贯彻。社员傅克明把收藏的最好的钢锉也卖给合作社了。他说：“以前我把它留藏起来作后路，现在用不着了。”这说明合作社如果在生产上成绩愈大，社员的情绪就愈高，社员的心就愈向合作社。
      时刻警惕坏分子的破坏
    成都市从建立合作社的时候就提出“不要坏人入社”、“不要资本家入社。”但是坏分子和不法资本家总想出许多办法混到合作社里来，或者同合作社保持联系。棉织生产合作社和皮件生产合作社都曾被隐瞒身份的人混进来过。丝织生产合作社等社也一度同出高价收货的商人关系很密切。坏分子和不法资本家打入合作社或同合作社发生联系后，就破坏合作社或者在社内组织小集团，打击积极分子；或者利用职权进行贪污；或者散播谣言，借故挑拨基层社同联社、合作社同国营商业的关系，甚至篡夺合作社的领导权。所以合作社必须严格注意队伍的纯洁，十分警惕地以正确态度和私商发生买卖关系。任何疏忽大意、贪图小便宜的思想都将成为坏分子和不法资本家破坏合作社的漏洞。
    克服资本主义思想和自发倾向
    巩固和逐步提高手工业生产合作社的基本问题，就在于经常克服社内的资本主义思想和小生产者的自发倾向。从去年检查十一个老社的工作情况来看，资本主义思想对合作社的影响和小生产者自发倾向的表现是各种各样的：棉织生产合作社和丝织生产合作社长期有计划的虚报生产成本，当市场销路转好时就故意提出许多困难问题要求国营贸易公司解决，拒绝国营贸易公司按标准检验产品质量，不想给国营贸易公司加工，跟私商的关系很密切，为了获得高额利润，这些社组织社员加班加点，给私商赶制货品。皮件生产合作社则把国营贸易公司加工的原料故意大材小用，剩下来的归社有，造成严重浪费，并用坏皮子换好皮子，所雇工人达社员总数的百分之七十。此外，有的合作社内干部不团结，骄傲自满，贪污腐化的现象也很不少；在生产方面普遍叫喊工效、质量已经“到顶”，有的社随便盲目的增加工资到一倍以上等等。
    要扭转这种情况，必须（一）发动社员群众，根据社内存在的问题广泛揭露资本主义思想行为的丑恶事实，指出资本主义思想对合作社的引诱和危害。（二）选择典型事例，不断地批判资本主义思想。
  （三）提出改正的办法并贯彻实行。（四）在这些工作基础上展开合理化建议运动，进而转入劳动竞赛。事实证明，经过这一系列的工作后，社员的政治思想就会提高。因此在合作社建成后，必须注意加强政治思想工作，及时跟资本主义思想作严肃的斗争，积极树立社会主义思想，否则合作社的巩固是不可能的。
    注意培养和提高干部
    培养和提高合作社的干部，对合作社的成长有着很重要的关系。合作社干部大多数是积极热情的，这是好的。但是，对手工业合作化的方针政策了解不深，自愿互利的原则不能很好掌握，办社不会领导生产，不会民主管理的也是相当普遍，因而在工作中不免有力不胜任或处理问题发生错误的情形。所以必须积极对他们进行耐心的培养。培养的办法，如：开办短期训练班、组织工作组到合作社协助、开座谈会交流经验、领导同志深入参加合作社的会议检查工作以及办业余学校等。但成都市对这些工作，还缺乏系统的研究和布置，譬如：办训练班只是在建社前或在中心工作前才办，没有逐步建立轮训制度；开座谈会交流经验只是在少数几个合作社之间进行，而且做得不经常；工作组深入的重点合作社所取得的经验教训没有及时推广等等。随着手工业生产合作社的逐步发展，和合作社工作更加细致和复杂，抓紧这一工作是很重要的。只有不断地大批地培养出热爱工作、大公无私、技术熟练并为群众所拥护的干部来，合作社的发展和巩固才有保证。
