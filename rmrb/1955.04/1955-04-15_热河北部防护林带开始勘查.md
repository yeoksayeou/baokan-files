Reconnaissance of Northern Hebei Shelterbelt Begins

The Hebei Provincial Forestry Bureau's survey team, consisting of twenty-eight survey groups and more than one hundred cadres, was dispatched in early April to the five counties and banners of Chifeng, Wudan, Aohan, Ongniute, and Jianping in northern Hebei to conduct survey design and production planning for the northern Hebei farmland shelterbelt.

This year, the survey team is tasked with completing the reconnaissance and design work for the northern Hebei farmland shelterbelt covering over 20 million mu, a fourfold increase compared to 1954. This year's survey area encompasses approximately 400 villages. In addition to carrying out shelterbelt design work in these 400 villages, the survey team will also assist farmers in these villages with agricultural production planning, formulating targets for the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry over the next fifteen years.

Northern Hebei Province suffers from severe wind and sand disasters, which often prevent farmers from sowing on time, resulting in poor harvests and sometimes even complete crop failure, significantly impacting agricultural production. Therefore, the state has designated this region as a component of the western Northeast shelterbelt and a key focus of national forestry construction. After the completion of all afforestation within fifteen years, natural disasters will be largely controlled, and agricultural production will increase by 20 to 30 percent based on current levels.

    热河北部防护林带开始勘查
    热河省林业局调查队二十八个调查组，一百多名干部，于四月初分赴热北赤峰、乌丹、敖汉、翁牛特和建平五县、旗进行热北农田防护林带的调查设计和生产规划工作。
    今年调查组要完成两千多万亩的热北农田防护林带的勘查设计工作，比一九五四年增加了四倍。今年勘查的地区大约有四百多个村庄。调查组除了在这四百多个村庄进行防护林带设计工作外，还要帮助这些村庄的农民进行农业生产规划，制定十五年内的农林牧全面发展生产的指标。
    热河省北部风沙灾害比较严重，经常使农民不能按时播种，造成歉收，有时甚至颗粒不收，对农业生产影响很大。因此，国家把这个地区列为东北西部防护林带的组成部分和国家林业建设重点之一。十五年内全部造林结束后，自然灾害将可基本控制，农业生产量也将在现在基础上增加百分之二十至三十。（于海田）
