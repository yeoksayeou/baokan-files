To inspire children's interest in science and technology, further develop aviation model activities, and strengthen the reserve force of the motherland's aviation team, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League and other units held the Shanghai Children's Aviation Model Performance Conference on April 5th. More than 8,000 children and guests from middle schools, primary schools, and supplementary schools participated in the conference.

More than 50 aviation models were performed, including catapult, rubber band powered, tow glider, and Sakolov types. These aviation models were all made by members of the aviation model groups of the China Welfare Association Shanghai Children's Palace and more than ten middle and primary schools, such as Hongkou Middle School and the Affiliated Middle School of East China Normal University. At the same time, five engine-powered aviation models made by teachers, factory technicians, and other amateurs also participated in the performance.

In recent years, under the care of party organizations and the People's Government, aviation model activities have been gradually developed in middle and primary schools in Shanghai, and it has become a military sports activity and science and technology activity that children very much love. According to incomplete statistics, 140 middle schools and many primary schools in Shanghai have established aviation model groups. Jiguang Middle School has established 15 groups, and almost every Young Pioneer squadron has an aviation model group; the aviation model group of Hongkou Middle School has persisted for several years.

    少年儿童举行航空模型表演
    为了启发少年儿童对科学技术的爱好，进一步开展航空模型运动，壮大祖国航空队伍的后备力量，中国新民主主义青年团上海市委员会等单位，在四月五日举行上海市少年儿童航空模型表演大会，参加大会的有中、小学校及补习学校的少年儿童和来宾八千多人。
    表演的航空模型有弹射式、橡筋动力、牵引滑翔、萨可洛夫等类型五十多架。这些航空模型都是由中国福利会上海少年宫航空模型小组和虹口中学、华东师范大学附中等十多个中、小学校的航空模型小组组员们自己制造的。同时有教师和工厂技术人员等业余制造的五架发动机航空模型也参加表演。
    几年来在党组织和人民政府的关怀下，航空模型运动已经在上海的中小学校里逐步开展起来，它已经成为少年儿童非常喜爱的一项军事体育活动和科学技术活动。据不完全统计，上海全市已经有一百四十个中学和很多小学成立了航空模型小组。继光中学成立了十五个小组，几乎每个少年先锋队中队都有了航空模型小组；虹口中学的航空模型小组已经坚持了好几年。
