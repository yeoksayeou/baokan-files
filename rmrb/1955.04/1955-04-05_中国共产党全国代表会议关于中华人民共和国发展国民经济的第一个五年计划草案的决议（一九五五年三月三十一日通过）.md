    Resolution of the National Congress of the Communist Party of China on the Draft First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the People's Republic of China
   (Adopted on March 31, 1955)
    The National Congress of the Communist Party of China agrees with the content of the draft First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the People's Republic of China proposed by the Central Committee and the report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy made by Comrade Chen Yun on behalf of the Central Committee, and believes that this plan is a major step towards realizing the Party's general line during the transition period. All comrades of the Party must, under the leadership of the Central Committee, unite the people of all ethnic groups across the country, work diligently, overcome difficulties, strive to increase production, practice strict economy, and struggle to fulfill and overfulfill this plan.
    The National Congress suggests that the Central Committee, based on the opinions discussed at this meeting, make necessary revisions to the draft Five-Year Plan and, after the revisions, submit it to the Second Session of the First National People's Congress for deliberation and adoption.
