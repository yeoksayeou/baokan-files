Harbin Organizes Workers' Voluntary Housing Exchange

    The Harbin Municipal Real Estate Administration adopted a method of organizing voluntary exchanges among the masses, through which more than 600 workers' residences were exchanged, providing convenience for more than 5,000 people. Workers who previously had to change vehicles several times to get to work and return home no longer have to travel long distances. This saves both time and transportation costs. Worker families with large houses and few people and those with small houses and many people have also been introduced to each other by the Real Estate Bureau for voluntary exchange, and the living arrangements are now quite suitable for both.

    哈尔滨组织职工自愿调换住宅
    哈尔滨市房地产管理局采用了组织群众自愿互换的办法，调换了六百多户职工住宅，使五千多口人得到了方便。以前上班和回家都要换几次车的职工，现在不用赶远路了。既节省时间，又节省车费。屋大人少和屋小人多的职工家庭也经过房地局介绍，自愿互换，住起来都挺合适。（本报驻哈尔滨记者）
