The ancient city of Lueyang in southern Shaanxi Province has become youthful due to the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway here. On the Jialing River next to Lueyang City, masts now stand in rows, and hundreds and thousands of wooden boats frequently travel between Lueyang and Guangyuan in Sichuan Province. Sanhe Dam, south of Lueyang City, is where the Jialing River and its two tributaries converge. Originally a desolate river滩 [tān - sandbank, shoal], it is now where many warehouses have been built and many tents have been set up. The river滩 is piled with wood, stone, bamboo, and cement. Every evening, teams of cars and mule carts travel along the newly built Mian-Lue Highway to the warehouses at Sanhe Dam. In the first quarter of this year alone, the Second Engineering Bureau of the newly built railway transported more than 17,000 tons of road construction materials.

Lueyang was a remote small town with only 2,000 residents a year ago, and now the population has also increased. China Department Store, Xinhua Bookstore, China Cotton, Yarn and Fabrics Corporation, local supply and marketing cooperatives, and railway employee living supply stations have all established or expanded their outlets in the city. In the urban area, a mechanized flour mill, two machinery repair shops, and a wood processing plant have also been built. (Xinhua News Agency)

    宝成铁路给略阳城带来了青春
    陕西省南部古老的略阳城，由于宝成铁路在这里修建变得年青起来了。略阳城旁的嘉陵江江上，现在船桅林立，成百成千的木船经常往来于略阳到四川省广元之间。略阳城南的三河坝是嘉陵江和它的两条支流汇合的地方，本来是一片荒凉的河滩，现在这里也修建了大批库房，张设了不少帐棚。河滩上堆满了木料、石料、竹子、水泥。每到傍晚，成队的汽车、骡马车沿着新修的沔略公路来到三河坝的仓库跟前。今年第一季度，只是新建铁路第二工程局便运来了一万七千多吨筑路器材。
    略阳在一年以前还是一座只有两千居民的偏僻小城，现在的人口也增多了。中国百货公司、新华书店、中国花纱布公司和当地供销合作社以及铁路职工生活供应站，都在城里设立或扩大了门市部。城区一带，也兴建了一座机制面粉厂、两个机械器具修配所和一个木料加工厂。　（新华社）
