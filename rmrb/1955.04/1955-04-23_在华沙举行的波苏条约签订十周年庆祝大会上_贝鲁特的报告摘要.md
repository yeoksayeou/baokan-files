Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 21st: TASS Warsaw, April 21st: Bolesław Bierut, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, delivered a report at the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Polish-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Cooperation in Warsaw on the 20th.

    Bierut said that today we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Polish-Soviet Treaty. It is especially meaningful that the anniversary of the signing of this historic treaty coincides with the anniversary of V.I. Lenin. This treaty was born of the ideas of the victorious socialist revolution led by Lenin, and it is filled with the spirit of fraternal mutual assistance, international solidarity, and equality among nations, which are perfectly and creatively embodied in Lenin's immortal ideas and his cause. The treaty of friendship between our two countries is deeply rooted in the hearts of millions of Polish and Soviet people, and in their consciousness, it has become a guide for fraternal cooperation for common prosperity and happiness. This is the immeasurable historical achievement of the past decade.

    Bierut said that the great victory of the socialist countries in World War II enabled many European countries to eliminate the shackles of fascism and capitalism, thereby further breaking through the capitalist system, creating a new historical transformation in the international situation, and forming a new balance of power on the international stage. In the past five years, this transformation has been greatly deepened due to the victory of the Chinese revolution. The treaty of friendship between People's Poland and the Soviet Union, which we solemnly celebrate today on its tenth anniversary, is a reflection of this transformation in the international situation and a result of this transformation. This treaty of alliance and friendship reflects the new characteristics of international relations, which have never existed and could never exist in the history of the capitalist world.

    Bierut then talked about the development of friendship between the people of Poland and the Soviet Union in the past ten years, as well as the enormous selfless assistance the Soviet Union has given to Poland in various economic fields. He said: For the Polish people, the alliance and friendship with the Soviet Union has become an immeasurable spiritual and material pillar of all the creative achievements that the working masses of our motherland have achieved in the past ten years. Whether in the post-war recovery period or during the large-scale construction under the Six-Year Plan, we have had the opportunity not only to gain Soviet experience, but also to obtain direct economic and financial assistance from the Soviet Union. The total amount of loans the Soviet Union has given to Poland for ordering goods and industrial equipment from the Soviet Union has reached about three billion rubles in the past decade.

    Bierut said that without the help of the Soviet Union, the construction and reconstruction of the foundation of Poland's socialist industrialization—heavy industry and machinery manufacturing—would not have been possible as quickly as it is now. We have obtained equipment for dozens of large industrial enterprises from the Soviet Union through loans, including the Lenin Metallurgical Combine, the Warsaw High-Quality Steel Factory, the Warsaw and Lublin Automobile Factories, the Jaworzno, Warsaw, and Tychów Power Stations, the Kędzierzyn Nitrogen Fertilizer Factory, the Oświęcim Carbide Factory, the "Wierzbica" large cement factory, and the textile factories in Białystok, Zambrów, and Fasti. Most of the new industrial enterprises are built according to Soviet technical data, with equipment and machinery supplied by the Soviet Union, and relying on the help of Soviet experts in construction and installation work.

    Scientists in our two countries are increasingly exchanging scientific experience extensively. We are increasingly utilizing major achievements in Soviet science and technology. The Soviet Union is introducing us to its scientific achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy. This is a brilliant example of the socialist countries' attitude towards scientific achievements. This kind of help from the Soviet Union will enable Polish scientists to conduct research in various fields and promote the development of Polish nuclear physics.

    Speaking about the international situation, Bierut said: We have learned a lot in the past few years, but we especially clearly understand one truth. The predatory face of American imperialism and its accomplices—the shameless rebuilders of the Hitler Wehrmacht and the barbaric adventurers wielding atomic weapons—is now more exposed than ever.

    The American dictators are forcing the ratification of the Paris Agreements and the remilitarization of West Germany, while also attempting to undermine negotiations on disarmament issues, but there is no doubt that they will be met with increasingly strong resistance from the people of Western Europe. The position taken by the Soviet Union on the Austrian issue, which was warmly welcomed by the Austrian people, thoroughly exposed the clumsy and peace-hating tricks of the imperialist politicians.

    At the same time, the people of Asia and Africa are raising their voices ever more loudly, realizing how much strength they have when they unite, and wanting to break free from the shackles of colonialism, refusing to allow their countries to become military bases for American aggressors.

    Bierut continued: The continuous increase in the strength and advantages of our camp, its unity and cooperation in preventing aggression, and its defense forces are all indispensable conditions for the victory of the forces of peace over the forces of war. Our Joint Command of Armed Forces will serve this purpose. The stronger and more united our camp is, the more we can sober up those atomic adventurers' dazed minds, because it is clear that any provocative attempt will end in failure. The Polish-Soviet Treaty is an integral part and a solid link in the entire security system of our camp. Therefore, we must protect it as we protect the apple of our eye. The celebration of the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Polish-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance is not only an opportunity for us to summarize the outstanding achievements of our fraternal cooperation, nor is it only an opportunity for us to look back on the past and jointly recall the common experiences and joys that have united the people of our two countries. This festival is also an encouragement and a call to us, calling on us to intensify our creative efforts to increase labor productivity, increase agricultural production, reduce costs, and strengthen our national defense. The strengthening of the power and ideological unity of the entire peaceful and socialist camp led by the great Soviet Union is a reliable guarantee for ensuring our country's security and enhancing the people's welfare, and ensuring our progress towards a better life for millions of ordinary people.

    On this day of the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship between Poland and the Soviet Union, we have the right to say: We have not failed the trust of our friends in the past, and we will never fail the trust of our friends. We express our deep gratitude and appreciation for the enormous help our people received in the most difficult days, and we must firmly remember this and constantly strengthen in our consciousness the idea of the great and immortal international proletarian solidarity.

    在华沙举行的波苏条约签订十周年庆祝大会上
    贝鲁特的报告摘要
    新华社二十二日讯　塔斯社华沙二十一日讯：波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记贝鲁特二十日在华沙举行的波苏友好、互助与战后合作条约签订十周年庆祝大会上作了报告。
    贝鲁特说，我们今天庆祝波苏条约签订十周年。尤其有意义的是，这个历史性条约签订的周年纪念同弗·伊·列宁的纪念日恰好碰在一起。这个条约是列宁领导的胜利的社会主义革命的思想所诞生的，这个条约充满了兄弟互助、国际团结和各国平等的精神，而这些东西在列宁的不朽思想和他的事业中得到完美的创造性的体现。我们两国的友好条约深入千千万万波兰和苏联人民的心中，在他们意识中成了为共同的繁荣和幸福而进行兄弟合作的指南，这就是过去十年难以估计的历史成果。
    贝鲁特说，社会主义国家在第二次世界大战中的伟大胜利使得许多欧洲国家消灭了法西斯主义和资本主义的束缚，从而进一步突破了资本主义制度，在国际形势中造成了新的历史转变，在国际舞台上形成了新的力量对比。在最近五年中，由于中国革命的胜利，这一转变大大地深刻化了。我们今天隆重庆祝的人民波兰和苏联之间已经签订十周年的友好条约，是国际形势中这种转变的反映，是这种转变的结果。这个同盟和友好的条约反映出国际关系的新特征，而这种国际关系是在资本主义世界的历史上从来没有而且也不可能有的。
    贝鲁特接着谈到了过去十年来波苏两国人民友谊的发展，以及苏联在经济各方面对波兰的巨大无私的援助。他说：对于波兰人民来说，同苏联的同盟和友谊成为了我们祖国劳动群众在过去十年中所获得的一切创造性成就的不可估量的精神和物质上的支柱。无论在战后的恢复时期，或是在根据六年计划实行大规模基本建设的时期，我们不但有机会获得苏联的经验，而且有机会获得苏联的经济和财政上的直接援助。苏联贷给波兰用以向苏联订购货品以及工业装备的贷款的总数在过去十年中达到了三十亿卢布左右。
    贝鲁特说，如果没有苏联的帮助，波兰社会主义工业化的基础——重工业和机器制造业的建设和改建工作是不可能进行得像现在那样快的。我们以贷款购买的方式从苏联那里获得好几十个大工业企业的设备，其中有列宁冶金联合企业、华沙优质钢工厂、华沙和卢布林的汽车工厂、雅沃日诺、华沙和迪霍夫的发电站、肯杰仁氮肥工厂、奥斯威辛碳化物工厂、“维日彼查”大型水泥厂、比亚特尔科夫、赞布罗夫和法斯蒂的纺织工厂等。大多数新工业企业的建设都是根据苏联的技术资料进行的，设备和机器由苏联供应，在建筑和安装工作方面也依靠苏联专家的帮助。
    我们两国的科学家越来越广泛地交流科学经验。我们越来越多地利用苏联科学和技术进步中的重大成就。苏联正在把在和平使用原子能方面的科学成就介绍给我们。这是社会主义国家对待科学成果的态度的光辉榜样。苏联的这种帮助将使波兰科学家们能够进行各方面的研究，促进波兰核子物理学的发展。
    贝鲁特在谈到国际形势时说：我们在过去几年中学到了很多，但是我们特别清楚地懂得了一个真理。美帝国主义及其帮凶们——希特勒国防军的厚颜无耻的重建者和挥舞着原子武器的横蛮的冒险分子——的掠夺性面貌现在是比任何时候都更加露骨了。
    美国独裁者强使批准巴黎协定和使西德重新军国主义化，同时还企图破坏关于裁军问题的谈判，但是毫无疑问，他们将遭到西欧人民的越来越强烈的反抗。受到奥地利人民热烈欢迎的苏联在奥地利问题上所采取的立场，彻底揭露了帝国主义政客们的仇视和平的笨拙的花招。
    同时，亚非两洲的人民发出越来越强烈的呼声，他们了解到他们团结起来会有多大的力量，并想要挣脱殖民主义的桎梏，不让自己的国家变成为美国侵略者的军事基地。
    贝鲁特接着说：我们这个阵营的实力和优势的不断增加，它在防止侵略方面的团结和合作，它的防御力量，这一切都是和平力量战胜战争力量的不可缺少的条件。我们武装力量的联合司令部就将为这一目的服务。我们阵营的力量越强大和越团结，我们也越能叫那些原子冒险家的发昏的头脑清醒过来，因为很明显，任何的挑衅的企图都是要以失败告终的。波苏条约是我们阵营的整个安全体系的一个组成部分和牢固的一环。因此我们要像保护眼珠一样地保护它。波苏友好、互助条约签订十周年的庆典，不仅是我们总结我们的兄弟合作的杰出成绩的机会，也不仅是我们回顾过去和共同回亿使我们两国人民结成一体的共同经历和喜悦的机会。这个节日对我们来说还是一个激励和号召，它号召我们加紧我们的创造性努力来提高劳动生产率，增加农业生产，降低成本和加强我们的国防。伟大的苏联所领导的整个和平和社会主义阵营的力量和思想团结的加强，是保障我国安全和增进人民福利、保障我们为千百万普通人民的生活向前迈进的可靠保证。
    在波苏两国签订友好条约十周年纪念日这一天，我们有权利说：我们过去没有辜负我们朋友的信任，而且永远也不会辜负我们朋友的信任。我们对于当我国人民在最艰苦的时日里所获得的巨大帮助表示深刻的感谢和感激，我们要牢牢地记住这一点，而且要在我们的意识中经常加强伟大的和不朽的国际无产阶级团结的思想。
