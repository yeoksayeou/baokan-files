    The Safety of Goods Transported by Rail Must Be Guaranteed
    Dai Zifei
    On railway lines across the country, millions of tons of goods are transported day and night. Every bag of grain, every piece of timber, every bolt of cotton cloth represents the fruits of the hard work of workers, farmers, and other working people, and the materials needed for national industrial construction and the daily lives of the working people. To transport these materials quickly and safely is undoubtedly the glorious duty of every railway employee. However, in reality, not all railway employees recognize and achieve this in their work. In railway transport, accidents involving goods are still very serious, and many goods are lost or damaged in transit. In 1954 alone, more than 29,000 accidents involving the transport of goods occurred on national railways, an increase of about 10 percent compared to 1953. Compensation for the loss of goods amounted to more than 567,000 yuan. This compensation could buy more than 59,000 bags of flour, which, if transported in 30-ton standard vehicles, could fill 50 freight cars. These are only the direct losses of the goods themselves. The losses caused by the damage of goods in transit, such as the suspension of capital construction due to lack of materials, the impact on industrial and agricultural production, and the confusion in distribution and supply, are incalculable. For example, two of the three large boilers ordered by a construction site in Dalian were damaged when they were unloaded in Xibianmen, Beijing, delaying the capital construction project. Many of the machines and instruments sent by the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries to support China's industrial construction have also been damaged in our railway transportation. A heavy machine transported from the German Democratic Republic was damaged due to the disengagement of the crane during transshipment in Manzhouli, resulting in a loss of more than 23,000 yuan for the goods themselves. Twenty-four seeders transported from the State-owned 53rd Farm in Xinyang to Minggang were damaged during unloading and sent back to Xinyang for repair, affecting the sowing work. All parts of the country are calling for saving food, but the loss of food in railway transportation is very alarming. In 1954, more than 6,000 accidents involving the transport of grain occurred on national railways. According to the statistics of the Rihuigang Station of the Shanghai Railway Administration alone, in the eight days from December 28, 1954, to January 4, 1955, 46 carloads of grain arrived damaged due to dampness. For example, on August 22 and 23, 1954, 16 carloads of flour sent from the Xi'an Grain Company to the Beijing Grain Bureau were continuously damaged by rain due to leaks in the covered wagons. Cases of grain leakage, contamination, and adulteration with poisonous substances, rendering it inedible, also frequently occur. The loss of coal in railway transportation is also very serious. One carload of coal sent from Hegang to Suihua on February 4 last year lost 27 tons en route. Such examples are too numerous to mention.
    There are many reasons for accidents involving the transport of goods, and the failure of railway employees to conscientiously implement regulations is one of the main reasons. Some employees have a weak sense of responsibility and have not truly established the concept of cherishing state property, and they take a indifferent attitude towards preventing accidents. For example, the weigher at the Zhifang Station of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration found that there was residual asphalt in the car before loading, but he did not clean it up and allowed 255 packages of wheat to be contaminated. The Hankou Transportation Business Office piled the arrived building materials on the open-air platform for more than two months without notifying the owner to collect them, causing the batch of materials to be corroded and causing great losses. In addition, some loading and unloading workers have a low level of political awareness, only aiming for quick loading and unloading, and casually throwing goods, so that damage to goods accounted for the first place in all types of transportation accidents in 1954.
    The fundamental reason for the serious accident situation is that the leading cadres at all levels of the railway have not had sufficient understanding of the seriousness and harm of accidents involving the transport of goods, and have failed to earnestly educate employees to strictly implement regulations and prevent accidents involving the transport of goods. Some leading cadres not only do not attach importance to and prevent accidents involving the transport of goods, but sometimes, in order to simply complete tasks, they order on-site employees to violate regulations, resulting in the loss of goods. For example, fifteen carloads of wheat were sent from Heshangqiao Station on the Jinghan Railway to Xinxiang Station, using open wagons for transportation. The director of the Zhengzhou Railway Sub-bureau ordered that tarpaulins not be covered in order to rush the number of carloads, causing the wheat to be exposed to rain. Some leading cadres also have a wrong view that "accidents in the transportation of goods are inevitable." It is under the guidance of this erroneous thinking that accidents involving the transport of goods are becoming increasingly serious, but the leadership has not paid attention to and been vigilant. Facts have proved that as long as regulations are conscientiously implemented, accidents involving the transport of goods can not only be prevented, but also completely eliminated. The experience of many advanced workers and advanced stations in eliminating accidents powerfully proves this point. Unfortunately, these experiences have not been widely promoted.
    Some railway administrations do not deal with accidents seriously and have adopted an attitude of leniency and tolerance towards those responsible for accidents, making some employees believe that "it doesn't matter if accidents happen." The Zhengzhou Railway Administration had a relatively serious situation of accidents involving the transport of goods in 1954, but in that year, it did not hold a single accident inspection meeting with more significance, nor did it seriously deal with those responsible for the accidents, so accidents involving the transport of goods occurred repeatedly.
    1955 is a year of decisive significance for the construction of my country's first five-year plan, and this year more goods will be transported by rail than last year. Therefore, it is hoped that the railway department, especially the railway business department, will take active and effective measures in response to the serious situation of accidents involving the transport of goods to ensure the safety of goods in railway transportation and support national construction.

    必须保证铁路运送货物的安全
    戴自奋
    在全国各铁路线上，日日夜夜运输着千百万吨的货物，其中每一袋粮食，每一根木材，每一匹棉布，都是工人、农民和其他劳动人民辛勤劳动的果实，都是国家工业建设和劳动人民日常生活所需的物资。迅速地并且安全地运送这些物资，无疑地是每个铁路员工的光荣职责。然而事实上却并非所有铁路员工在工作中都认识和做到了这一点。在铁路运输中，货物运送事故还是十分严重的，许多货物在运输过程中遭到了损失或毁坏。一九五四年内全国铁路就发生货物运送事故二万九千多件，比一九五三年增加了百分之十左右，货物损失的赔款，就达五十六万七千余元。这些赔款若用以购买面粉，可以买五万九千多袋，用三十吨标准车辆来装运，可以装满五十个车皮。这些还仅仅是货物本身的直接损失，至于因货物在运输途中遭受损毁而造成基本建设停工待料，影响工农业生产，引起分配供应的纷乱等等损失，更是无法计算。例如，有一个工地在大连订制的三个大型锅炉，运抵北京西便门后，由于卸车不注意摔坏了二个，延误了基本建设工程。苏联和各人民民主国家为支援我国工业建设运来的机械仪器，也有许多在我们铁路运输中受到损失。从德意志民主共和国运来的重型机器在满洲里换装时因起重机脱钩而损坏，单货物本身就损失二万三千余元。国营五三农场由信阳运至明港的二十四行播种机，在卸车时被摔坏，又送回信阳修理，影响了播种工作。全国各地都在号召节约粮食，但在铁路运输中粮食的损失却是十分惊人的。一九五四年全国铁路共发生粮食运送事故六千余件。仅就上海铁路管理局日晖港一站统计：自一九五四年十二月二十八日至一九五五年一月四日八天中，到达粮食因潮湿损失的即有四十六车，又如一九五四年八月二十二、二十三两日内，由西安粮食公司发往北京粮食局的面粉，就因棚车漏雨连续湿损了十六个车皮。粮食漏失污损以及因同毒品混装以致不能食用的情况也经常发生。煤炭在铁路运输中丢失的情形也是十分严重的，去年二月四日由鹤岗发往绥化的一车煤，在途中漏失了二十七吨。这样的例子真是不胜枚举。
    产生货物运送事故的原因很多，而铁路员工不认真执行规章制度则是主要原因之一。部分员工工作责任心不强，没有真正树立爱护国家物资的观念，对防止事故采取漠不关心态度。如郑州铁路管理局纸坊站司磅员在装车前已发现车内残留沥青不加清扫，竟听任小麦污损二百五十五包。汉口运输营业所将到达的建筑器材堆放露天站台两个多月而不通知货主领取，使这批器材受到腐蚀，造成很大的损失。此外，部分装卸工人政治觉悟不高，光图快装快卸，随便摔放货物，以致一九五四年货物破损事故竟占各类运送事故的第一位。
    事故情况严重的根本原因，则是铁路各级领导干部对货物运送事故的严重性和危害性没有足够的认识，没能认真教育员工严格执行规章制度，防止货物运送事故。有些领导干部不仅不重视和防止货物运送事故，有时单纯为了完成任务，竟命令现场员工违章办事，以致造成货物的损失。如京汉路和尚桥站发往新乡站小麦十五车，以敞车装运，郑州铁路分局局长为了抢装车数，竟命令不盖篷布，致使小麦遭受雨淋。一部分领导干部还存在着一种错误的看法，认为“运输货物出些事故在所难免”。正是在这种错误思想支配指导下，货物运送事故日趋严重，领导方面却没有加以重视和警惕。事实证明，只要认真执行规章制度，货物运送事故不仅可以防止，而且是完全可以消灭的。许多先进工作者和先进车站消灭事故的经验，有力地证明了这一点。可惜这些经验还没有普遍推广。
    有些铁路管理局对事故处理不严肃，对事故责任者采取了姑息容忍的态度，使部分员工以为“出事故无所谓”。郑州铁路管理局一九五四年货物运送事故是比较严重的，但在这一年内，没有为此开过一次比较有意义的事故检查会，也没有严肃处理过事故的责任者，因而货物运送事故一再发生。
      一九五五年是我国第一个五年计划建设具有决定意义的一年，今年将有较去年更多的货物经由铁路运输。因此，希望铁道部门特别是铁路商务部门，针对货物运送事故的严重情况，积极采取有效措施，以保证货物在铁路运输中的安全，支援国家建设。
