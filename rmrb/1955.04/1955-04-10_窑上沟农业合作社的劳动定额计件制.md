The Labor Quota Piece-Rate System in Yaoshanggou Agricultural Cooperative
Shi Yuzhen
Further Implement the Production Responsibility System

Since the Yaoshanggou Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, implemented the contracting output quota system in 1952, it has initially implemented the production responsibility system and basically eliminated the phenomenon of wasting labor. However, until the spring of 1954, the phenomenon of cooperative members choosing easy work over hard work, general work over technical work, and slack-time work over busy-time work was still quite common. Why was this phenomenon still occurring? The main reason was that contracting output only solved the responsibility relationship between the cooperative and the production team/group. The issue of assigning tasks and calculating work points within the labor group had not been resolved. Within the group, there was no reasonable standard for evaluating work and calculating points, and the "dead points, live evaluation" method was always poorly implemented. Every day, after evaluating the work, regardless of whether it was light work, heavy work, technical work, or non-technical work, everyone's work points were roughly the same. As a result, the enthusiasm of the cooperative members could not be fully stimulated, and the various phenomena mentioned above were naturally difficult to avoid.

In early June 1954, in order to solve this problem, the cooperative cadres conducted multiple studies and finally decided to learn from the advanced experience of Soviet collective farms and implement the labor quota piece-rate system. Everyone believed that only this method could further implement the production responsibility system, overcome egalitarianism in calculating labor remuneration, and improve the sense of responsibility and enthusiasm of the cooperative members.

On-site Experimentation, Standardizing Labor Quotas

The most important task in implementing the piece-rate system was standardizing labor quotas. The cooperative affairs committee decided to use the amount of work completed by a medium-level laborer working diligently for one day as the quota standard. The benefit of doing this was that workers with weaker labor power could meet the quota through effort, and workers with stronger labor power could exceed the quota. Based on this principle, the work of evaluating and determining quotas began. The work order was to start with the main farm work, then promote it to general farm work; start with one season's farm work, then proceed to the whole year. In the process of evaluation, many problems arose. Most cooperative members wanted to set the quota lower, believing that it would be easier to exceed. Some selfish individuals wanted the quota for work they could do to be set lower, and the quota for work they could not do to be set higher. The cooperative affairs committee adopted two methods to solve these problems: one was to strengthen labor education to overcome the cooperative members' thinking of only considering themselves; the other was to organize cooperative members for on-site experiments. At that time, it was the time to harvest wheat. Some people said that they could only harvest five or six fen of land per day, while others said they could harvest more than one mu. The cooperative committee organized Yang Yuande's group for collective experimentation, and also had Han Jinmu, who had medium labor power and was known for his honesty, conduct individual experimentation. Cooperative director Wang Jinyun also personally conducted experimentation. After two days of harvesting, all three experiments proved that two mu could be harvested per day. Finally, the quota for wheat harvesting was set at two mu per day. More than 20 kinds of farm work that could be experimented on-site were all standardized through experimentation. Those that could not be experimented on immediately were evaluated based on past experience. (Editor's note: When standardizing quotas, attention should be paid not only to quantity, but also to specific quality standards.)

In the process of standardizing quotas, conditions such as the distance of the land and the difficulty of cultivation were also taken into consideration. For example, for carrying night soil, the Shifogou land was four li away from the village, and the quota was seven loads per day, while the land in the north and south was next to the village, and the quota was forty loads per day.

Grading and Remuneration Based on Labor

With quotas, it was also necessary to classify various farm works according to the different degrees of labor intensity and technical skills. When dividing the grades, the cooperative affairs committee convened old farmers for discussions on one hand, and organized labor groups to discuss on the other hand. First, various main farm works were divided into five grades: technical heavy work, heavy work, general technical work, and general work. Later, the work in each grade was further subdivided into thirteen levels, including a total of fifty-seven main farm works in the cooperative. In the discussion of grading, various farm works were repeatedly compared. For example, when evaluating the "seed selection" work, some people said that seed selection was general technical work and should be placed in the fourth grade; others said it was light work and should be placed in the fifth grade. Unable to decide, they compared it with the "seedling setting" work. Everyone believed that seedling setting must grasp the plant spacing in order to ensure uniform seedling retention and meet the standard number of seedlings to be retained, and must also be able to identify diseased plants. Without certain skills, this work could not be done. Seed selection only requires having a sample to follow. Finally, the "seed selection" work was placed in the fifth grade, and the "seedling setting" work was placed in the fourth grade. The grades of other kinds of work were also divided in this way.

How many labor days should each quota for each level of work be recorded? This was the issue that everyone was most concerned about. The cooperative adhered to the policy of "proceeding from the development of production and implementing the principle of 'to each according to his work'" and decided that the labor days for each quota of each grade of work should be different. However, given that the current production tools were still very backward and the technical level of the cooperative members was not much different, it was stipulated that the difference in labor days between the highest first-grade, first-level work and the lowest fifth-grade, third-level work should not exceed 0.5 labor days (5 fen of work points), and the difference between each level of work should not exceed 0.05 labor days (5 li of work points). The third-grade, first-level work, which is common in work and general in technology, was used as the horizontal line, and it was stipulated that each quota completed for third-grade, first-level work would be recorded as one labor day (10 fen of work points). Each level above third-grade, first-level work was recorded more work points, and each level below third-grade, first-level work was recorded less work points.

Revising Quotas According to Changes in Labor Conditions

Quotas must be revised as necessary according to changes in labor conditions. For example, the quota of "hoeing one mu of seedlings per day" was initially achievable by all medium-level laborers every day, but later it was impossible to meet the quota. After research, it was discovered that the conditions had changed: initially, the seedlings were small, there were few weeds, and the land was soft, so one mu could be hoed. Later, the seedlings were larger, the weeds were taller, and the land was harder, so only eight fen of land could be hoed per day. As a result, the quota was changed to hoeing eight fen of land. In 1954, the cooperative revised more than 10 kinds of quotas such as hoeing seedlings and cutting artemisia, mostly because of changes in conditions. Some were modified because the original ones were not appropriate.

Cultivation Quality Must Be Guaranteed

In the implementation of the quota method, it is necessary to strengthen inspection work to ensure the quality of cultivation. At the beginning of the implementation of the quota system, many cooperative members were sloppy in their work and underreported their work. In order to overcome these phenomena and ensure the quality of cultivation, the cooperative affairs committee adopted the following methods: one was to carry out labor competitions between groups, and also stipulated an inspection system. The entire cooperative conducted an inspection every half month and a summary every month. The groups were also mobilized to inspect each other during production. Another method was to establish a field management responsibility system for individual cooperative members. The task was to check the pest situation and the quality of cultivation in their respective responsibility areas. This responsibility system was divided into two types: one was to assign special personnel to be responsible for the flood control channels and high-yield fields and experimental fields that were prone to danger all year round; the other was to assign seasonal field work such as plowing, hoeing, and harvesting to individuals in sections each season. A further method was to pay attention to overcoming the phenomenon of cooperative members working desperately. Groups or cooperative members who might cause production losses due to rushing to work regardless of quality were seriously dealt with, either by rework or deduction of labor days. The use of livestock was stipulated to be overtime without additional work points, to prevent cooperative members from tiring out the livestock due to rushing to work. After these methods were gradually implemented, the phenomenon of neglecting quality gradually decreased.

Overall Arrangement, Democratic Task Assignment

After the implementation of the piece-rate system, new problems arose in the assignment of tasks, that is, everyone competed to do the work with high work points and was unwilling to do the work with low work points. Liu Xiyun originally did not know how to drive a cart, but because driving a cart recorded more labor days, he insisted on driving it. However, as a result of assigning him to drive the cart, others sent three carts of manure early in the morning, but he only sent two carts and overturned the cart, damaging the parts on the cart. In order to solve the problem of task assignment, the cooperative affairs committee, through discussion of Liu Xiyun's driving incident, educated the cooperative members to proceed from doing a good job in production and overcome the idea of simply earning labor days. A method of democratic task assignment was stipulated: for each task, the group leader would make an overall arrangement in advance, and divide the work preliminarily according to each person's expertise, and then submit it to everyone for discussion and decision. After the implementation of this method, the phenomenon of those who did not know how to do it and rushed to do it was reduced.

After the Implementation of the Labor Quota Piece-Rate System

After the Yaoshanggou Agricultural Cooperative implemented the labor quota piece-rate system, it overcame egalitarianism in labor remuneration, and labor productivity greatly increased. Because heavy work, technical work, etc. can get reasonable remuneration, the general young and middle-aged cooperative members and the skilled cooperative members no longer chose easy work or general work, so women and those with weaker labor power had more opportunities to participate in labor; after the implementation of the quota piece-rate system, the number of women regularly participating in labor in the cooperative increased from 70 to 105. In 1954, the labor days done by women accounted for 21% of the total labor days of the cooperative, so the cooperative saved 4,765 man-days that year. These surplus labor forces were used for agricultural infrastructure construction, including the construction of 329 flood control channels, 450 zhang of terraced embankments, and the improvement of 280 mu of soil. The construction of flood control channels alone could increase grain production by more than 140 dan. In addition, more than 40 warehouses and houses were built. The greater gain was that the cultivation skills of the cooperative members had been significantly improved. In the year 1954, 14 young men and women in the cooperative learned how to sow seeds with a seed drill, and more than 60 people learned how to identify seeds. In addition, 13 people learned how to use a horse-drawn plow, and 38 women learned general technical work such as pulling a large hoe. This created more favorable conditions for increasing production in the future.

    窑上沟农业合作社的劳动定额计件制
    史迂臻
    进一步贯彻生产上的责任制
    山西武乡县窑上沟农业生产合作社自从一九五二年实行包工包产制以后，初步贯彻了生产上的责任制，基本上消除了窝工浪费劳动力的现象。但直到一九五四年春天，社员干活挑轻活、避重活，拣一般活、避技术活，拣闲时活、躲忙时活的现象还相当普遍。为什么还有这种现象呢？主要原因是包工包产只是社包给生产队、生产组，只解决了社和劳动小组之间的责任关系问题，劳动小组内部派活计工的问题还没有解决。在小组里，评工计分没有合理的标准，“死分活评”的办法总是执行不好。每天评工评来评去，不管干的是轻活、重活，技术活、非技术活，各人的工分总是差不多。结果，社员劳动的积极性不能充分发挥，上面所说的各种现象自然也就难以避免了。
    一九五四年六月初，为了解决这个问题，社务干部们进行了多次研究，最后决定学习苏联集体农庄的先进经验，实行劳动定额计件制。大家认为只有这个办法能够进一步贯彻生产上的责任制，克服计算劳动报酬中的平均主义，提高社员们的工作责任心和积极性。
    实地试验，标定劳动定额
    实行定额计件制，最重要的一项工作是标定劳动定额。社务委员会确定以一个中等劳力忠实劳动
  一天所完成的活作为定额标准。这样做的好处是：劳力弱的经过努力能够达到定额，劳力强的可以超过定额。根据这个原则，就开始了评定定额的工作。工作顺序是从主要农活开始，然后推行到一般农活；先从一个季节的农活开始，然后进到全年。在评定当中，发生了不少问题，大部分社员都想把定额定低些，他们认为低了好超过。有些自私自利的人对自己能做的活要求定的低些，不能做的活希望定的高些。社务委员会采取了两种办法解决这些问题，就是：一面加强劳动教育，克服社员光为自己打算的思想；另一面组织社员实地试验。这时正该割麦子，有人说一天只能割五、六分地，有人说能割一亩多。社委会就让杨元德小组进行集体试验，又让劳力中等为人忠厚的韩金木进行个人试验，社长王锦云也亲自进行试验。割了两天，三个试验都证明一天可割二亩。最后确定割麦子的定额为一天二亩。能当时进行实地试验的二十多种农活，都经过试验标定了定额。不能立即试验的，就根据已往经验评定。（编者按：在标定定额时，不但要注意数量，还要规定具体的质量标准。）
    在标定定额当中还照顾了地的远近和耕作难易等条件。如担圊粪，石彿沟地离村四里远，每个定额为担七担，南北总地在村边上，定额为担四十担。
      划分等级，按劳计酬
    有了定额，还要把各种农活按劳动轻重、技术性强弱的不同程度划分等级。在划分等级时，社务委员会一面召集老农座谈，一面让各劳动小组进行讨论，先把各种主要农活分成技术重活、重活、一般技术活、一般活等五等。后来，又将各等里的活共细分成十三级，包括全社五十七种主要农活。在划分等级的讨论中，各种农活都进行了反复比较。如评定
  “选种”活时，有人说选种是一般技术活，应放在四等内；有人说是轻活，应放在五等内。决定不下，就和“定苗”活作对比，大家认为定苗必须掌握好株距，才能保证留苗均匀和达到应留株数标准，还得会识别病株，没有一定的技术就干不了这个活；选种就只要有个样子照办就行了。最后才把
  “选种”活放在五等里，“定苗”活放入四等。其他各种活的等级也是照这样划分的。
    究竟各级活的每个定额记多少劳动日？这是大家最关心的问题。这个社坚持了“从发展生产出发，贯彻‘按劳取酬’分配原则”的方针，决定各等各级活每个定额的劳动日都要有区别，但鉴于目前生产工具还很落后，社员的技术水平相差不多，所以规定最高的一等一级活和最低的五等三级活的劳动日差额，不能超过零点五个劳动日（五分工），各级活的差额不能超过零点零五个劳动日（五厘工）。并以活事中常、技术一般的三等一级活为水平线，规定每完成三等一级活的一个定额记一个劳动日（十分工）。三等一级以上的逐级多记工分，三等一级以下的逐级少记工分。
    根据劳动条件变化修订定额
    定额得随着劳动条件的变化加以必要的修订。如“每天锄一亩苗”这个定额，开始凡是中常劳力每天都能完成，但后来怎么也达不到定额了。经过研究，才发觉原来是条件变化了：起初苗小、草少、地又软，就能锄一亩，随后苗大、草高、地硬了，每天只能锄八分地。结果才把定额改变为锄八分地。一九五四年全社修改了锄苗、割蒿等十几种定额，大部分是因为条件变化而修改的。也有的是原来定的不合适而加以修改的。
      必须保证耕作质量
    在实行定额办法当中，必须加强检查工作，保证耕作质量。在实行定额之初，不少社员有做活粗糙，以少报多的现象。为了克服这些现象，保证耕作质量，社务委员会采取以下几种办法：一是在组和组之间开展劳动竞赛，同时又规定了检查制度。全社半月一检查，一月一总结。又发动各组在生产中互相检查。另一种办法是建立社员个人的田间管理责任制。任务是检查自己责任区内虫害情况和耕作质量。这种责任制又分两种：一是对容易出险的防洪渠和高额丰产地、试验地，设专人常年负责；一是田间季节性的活如耕地、锄苗、收割等，就逐季分片包给个人负责。再一种办法是，注意克服社员拚命干活的现象。对于因赶工不顾质量可能使生产受损失的小组或社员进行了认真的处理，或返工或扣劳动日。对使用牲口则规定了超额不加工的办法，防止社员因赶工累坏牲口。这几种办法逐步实行以后，忽视质量的现象渐渐少了。
      通盘安排，民主派活
    实行定额计件制以后，在派活当中，又发生了新的问题，就是大家都争着做工分高的活，不愿做工分低的活。刘希云本来不会赶车，因赶车记的劳动日多，他非赶不行。可是分配他赶车的结果，别人一早送三车粪，他只送了两车，还把车弄翻了，损坏了车上的零件。为了解决派活问题，社务委员会通过讨论刘希云赶车的事情，教育社员要从搞好生产出发，克服单纯赚劳动日思想。并规定了民主派活的办法：每一段活，由组长事先通盘安排，按每个人的特长初步分工再交大家讨论决定。实行这个办法以后，不会做而抢着做的现象少了。
    实行劳动定额计件制以后
    窑上沟农业合作社实行定额计件制以后，克服了劳动报酬上的平均主义，劳动生产率大大提高了。由于做重活、技术活等能得到合理的报酬，一般青壮年社员，有技术的社员再不挑轻活拣一般活做了，因而妇女和劳力弱的人就有了更多的参加劳动的机会；实行定额计件以后，全社妇女经常参加劳动的人数由七十人增加到一百零五人。一九五四年妇女所做的劳动日占全社总劳动日的百分之二十一，所以当年全社节省出人工四千七百六十五个。这些剩余的劳力用来进行农业基本建设，计修防洪渠三百二十九道，拍地堰四百五十丈，改良土壤二百八十亩。其中仅修防洪渠一项即可增产粮食一百四十多石。此外还修盖仓库、房子等四十多间。更大的收获是社员的耕作技术水平有了显著提高。一九五四年一年中间，男女青年社员们，学会摇耧下种的十四人，鉴定种子的六十多人。还有十三人学会了使用马拉犁，三十八个妇女学会拉大锄等一般技术活。这就给以后增加生产创造了更有利的条件。
