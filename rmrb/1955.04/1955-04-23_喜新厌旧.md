    “Love the New and Loathe the Old”
    Kong Sang
    In summarizing the production and capital construction work of 1954, the Ministry of Light Industry discovered that its affiliated enterprises had a total of over 61 million yuan worth of equipment in backlog. Among them, over 20 million yuan worth was completely unusable obsolete equipment, and over 40 million yuan worth was unused equipment in inventory. How big a number is more than 61 million yuan? It is enough to build a modern textile factory with 100,000 spindles and 1,000 looms. This shows that this is a not-so-small backlog and a waste.
    According to analysis, the equipment backlog is due in some cases to construction units lacking experience, and changing plans after the equipment was ordered; in some cases, it is due to enterprise leaders not understanding the situation and ordering blindly; and in many cases, it is due to the "love the new and loathe the old" mentality of enterprise leaders at play. For example, the Jilin Paper Mill started restoring and expanding from 1950. On the one hand, it lacked an overall design, and on the other hand, the leading cadres had the idea of "loving the new and loathing the old." For five full years, they have been using "balancing equipment" as an excuse to replace the old with the new. As a result, the equipment capacity becomes more and more "balanced," and the machines are replaced with newer and newer ones. A certain paper machine was only installed in 1951, and by 1953 it was replaced by a new machine... In the Tianjin Paper Mill and the Jinzhou Paper Mill, there were erroneous behaviors of dismantling perfectly good old machines and using them as spare parts in order to replace them with "new" ones.
    If we proceed from the overall and long-term interests, build more heavy industrial enterprises, and equip these factories and mines, which are of decisive significance to the national economy and the people's livelihood, with new modern equipment, and give full play to the strength of these factories and mines to fundamentally change the face of my country's national economy, this is entirely correct.
    However, if we only proceed from local and temporary interests, not utilize existing equipment, and demand new equipment everywhere, then it is wrong. For example, although my country's light industry is also not developed, the utilization rate of existing equipment has not yet been fully realized. Not utilizing this equipment and taking the money for building heavy industry to replace the equipment of existing light industry, even if all of it is replaced with new equipment, cannot fundamentally change the face of my country's economy, but instead create a new backlog of equipment. Therefore, the idea of requiring all enterprises to replace with new equipment, regardless of the enterprise, without proceeding from the policy of socialist industrialization centered on heavy industry, is clearly incorrect.

    “喜新厌旧”
    孔桑
    轻工业部总结一九五四年生产和基本建设工作时，发现所属企业共积压设备价值六千一百多万元。其中根本用不着的呆滞设备价值二千多万元，库存未用的设备价值四千多万元。六千多万元是多大的一个数字呢？它足够建设一座具有十万纱锭、一千台织布机的现代化纺织厂。由此可见这是一笔并不算小的积压，也是一种浪费。
    据分析，设备所以积压，有的是由于建设单位缺乏经验，设备订购以后又改变计划；有的是由于企业领导干部不了解情况，盲目订购；也有不少是由于企业领导干部“喜新厌旧”的思想在作怪。例如吉林造纸厂从一九五○年起就开始恢复和扩建，一方面缺乏整体设计，另一方面领导干部又有“喜新厌旧”的思想，至今整整五个年头，年年借口“平衡设备”，去旧换新。结果是设备能力越“平衡”越大，机器越换越新。某号造纸机是一九五一年才安装的，到一九五三年又被新的机器代替了……。在天津造纸厂和锦州造纸厂，为了换“新”，还有把完好的旧机器拆掉，当作零件用的错误行为。
    如果从全局和长远的利益出发，多建一些重工业企业，并用新的现代设备来装备这些对国计民生有决定意义的工厂和矿山，发挥这些工厂和矿山的力量，根本改变我国国民经济的面貌，这是完全应该的。
    但是，如果只从局部的暂时的利益出发，不利用现有设备，处处都要新设备，那就错了。例如我国的轻工业，虽然也不发达，但现有设备的利用率仍未全部发挥。不去利用这些设备，而把建设重工业的钱拿来更换现有轻工业的设备，即使全部换上新的，也无论如何不能根本改变我国经济的面貌，反而造成设备的新的积压。因此，不从以重工业为中心的社会主义工业化的方针出发，不论什么企业，都一律要求更换新设备的思想，显然是不正确的。
