Delhi Dispatch

By Our Correspondent Wu Wentao

On the eve of the Asian Countries Conference, I enjoyed the scenery of India's capital and met with representatives from all walks of life.

Although it is just April, it is already scorching summer here, with temperatures exceeding those of Beijing's dog days. Palms, banyan trees... adorn the streets with lush greenery. I remember just a week ago, we crossed the Yellow River and the Yangtze River in our homeland, a time when peach and plum trees were vying for beauty, and the spring breeze was refreshing. However, three days later, when we flew to Rangoon, the capital of Burma, it seemed as if we had entered another world. We kept fanning ourselves, and people were talking about how the weather would get even hotter later on. Delhi and Rangoon have similar weather. Although the story of Tang Sanzang's journey to the West through the Flaming Mountains in the "Journey to the West" is said to be set in another place, it is probably based on the extreme heat of the climate in "the Western Paradise" (as the ancients called India).

At a meeting of the Asian Countries Preparatory Committee, Chairman Rameshwari Nehru said that Asian countries "have a glorious history... In those days, we had very close contacts. Despite the difficulties of travel, we still maintained contact with each other." This is certainly true. In Patna, in today’s Bihar province of India, there once stood Nalanda University, with tens of thousands of students. It was there that our Tang Sanzang – Xuanzang – studied Buddhist scriptures from 629 to 645 AD. His book, "Great Tang Records on the Western Regions," is said to be an important historical material for understanding ancient India today. At that time, Xuanzang was treated with courtesy in many ways in India; even today, even our car drivers know the name Xuanzang.

Indeed, from the moment I boarded the Air India plane in Hong Kong, I began to experience the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples. On the wall of the cabin, there was a slogan in red letters on a white background: "Long Live Sino-Indian Friendship!" Upon arriving in Delhi, the expressions between hosts and guests were as warm as those of old friends reunited. A journalist who had been to China recalled to me the Chinese friends he had met. After his article introducing China was published, hundreds of readers wrote to him, asking him to continue writing. From Mr. Sundarlal, the white-haired and respected President of the India-China Friendship Association, I heard the story of the "All-India Conference for Peace and Asian People's Solidarity" held by the All-India Peace Council in Madras in early January this year.

At that conference, representatives from all over the country asked the Chinese cultural delegation, which was visiting India, to convey this message to the Chinese people: The Indian people will fight alongside China to defend world peace and strive for the freedom of all nations. It was also at that conference that the Indian people passed a resolution demanding that the American troops withdraw from Taiwan and its nearby islands and the Taiwan Strait, and that they not interfere in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. February 6 was designated as the national "U.S. Get Out of Taiwan Day."

On this day, meetings were held in major cities across the country. A large number of letters from individuals and organizations to the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in India stated that only when the U.S. troops withdraw from Taiwan can the tense situation in the Far East be eased. They said: Liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair; the Indian people shout to the United States: Get out of Taiwan, and do not interfere in China's internal affairs! Since then, in the large-scale mass movement protesting the U.S. preparations for atomic war, the Indian people have expressed concern for the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and the restoration of China's seat in the United Nations at all times and in all places.

In the central hall of the Parliament, I talked with Indian friends about the "Stop Preparing for Atomic War Day" for all the people of India on March 6. I understand that more than one hundred members of parliament have signed a petition against atomic war. The Indian people clearly know that at the Bangkok Conference on February 25, Dulles was still frantically brandishing his atomic bomb at the Asian people. However, amidst the nationwide surge of opposition in India against the American preparations for atomic war, such a ridiculous episode took place: the US Embassy Information Office in Delhi held a so-called "Exhibition on the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy." What a profound irony!

It is natural for people to understand that the purpose of this exhibition is, first of all, to deceive and to divert people's attention. Who doesn't know that what the American rulers care about is atomic war, not the peaceful use of atomic energy? Former Governor-General of India, Mr. Rajagopalachari, has recently written continuously to criticize the American atomic war maniacs and point out the hypocrisy of their high talk of the so-called peaceful use of atomic energy. Newspapers reported that the arrival of an American expert in India to negotiate the purchase of a large number of monkeys a few days ago has aroused serious attention in public opinion circles. People naturally associate the American purchase of monkeys with its continuous testing of atomic weapons.

In the past few days, the places that I and my comrades in the Chinese delegation have visited range from the Parliament to the countryside, from schools to families. In almost all occasions, you can hear the term "Panchshilla." This is the Hindi word for "Five Principles." Indeed, the Indian people regard Premier Zhou's visit to India and Prime Minister Nehru's visit to China as a matter of pride. In this way, the song "China and India are Brothers" composed by Mr. Katoba, a famous Indian musician, poet, and member of Parliament, has become one of the most beloved songs of the Indian people. People say that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence should not only be the common language of the Asian people, but also the standard for relations between countries around the world. The Asian Countries Conference is challenging the world with this content of striving for peace.

For the delegates attending the Asian Countries Conference, New Delhi and Old Delhi have put up slogans such as "Welcome to the Messengers of Asian Unity and Peace!" The importance the Indian people attach to the convening of this conference can be seen from the composition of the Indian Preparatory Committee. Among the eighty-nine famous figures from all walks of life, fifty-four are members of Parliament.

Now, the representatives of eighteen Asian countries have arrived one after another. After the opening ceremony and the plenary session, the conference will be divided into groups to discuss political, economic, scientific, social, and cultural issues, and make resolutions on various important issues.

It is not surprising that various slanders against the Asian Countries Conference are appearing in the newspapers of the United States, Western Europe, and some Asian bourgeoisies. This also precisely illustrates the importance of this conference.

The words of Dr. Kitchlew, Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, are correct. This was also at a gathering of Delhi literary and art circles. Dr. Kitchlew said that the whole world is watching this conference. Asian governments who will soon be participating in the Asian-African Conference in Indonesia are also watching this conference, because what will be sent out from this conference will be the unanimous voice of the Asian people firmly opposing colonialism and defending Asian and world peace.

    印京寄语

    德里通讯
    在亚洲国家会议开幕的前夕，我欣赏了印度京城的风光，接触到各界的代表人物。
    虽然刚交四月，这里已是夏日炎炎，温度超过北京的伏天。棕榈、榕树……给街道披上了浓绿的装束。记得一周前我们越过祖国的黄河和长江，那正是桃李争妍，春风爽人的时刻，而在三天后当我们飞抵缅甸京城仰光时，就似乎进入另一个世界了。我们不停地扇着扇子，人们谈论的是更热的时候还在以后。德里和仰光的天气差不多。西游记上所说的唐僧取经通过火焰山的故事虽然据说是别的地方，但这个故事的源于“西天”（古人称印度为西天）气候的十分炎热，大概是没有问题的。
    在一次亚洲国家筹备委员会的会议上，主席拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人说，亚洲国家“有着光辉的历史……那时候，我们曾有极密切的接触。尽管行旅的困难，我们彼此仍然实行了接触”。这话诚然是不错的。在今天的印度比哈尔省巴特那城，曾有过一所上万学生的那烂陀大学。在那里，我们的唐僧——玄奘就从公元六二九到六四五年研究过佛经。他所著的“大唐西域记”据说是当今了解古代印度的重要史料。当时玄奘曾受到印度多方面的礼遇；直到今天，连我们的汽车司机，都知道玄奘这个名字。
    的确，从香港搭上印度航空公司的飞机，我就开始体会到什么是中印两国人民间的传统友谊了。在机舱的墙壁上，挂着一个白底红字的标语：“中印友谊万岁！”到了德里，主人和客人间的表情，是故友重逢时的亲热。一位到过中国的新闻记者对我回忆他所接触过的中国朋友。在他写的介绍中国的文章发表后，成百的读者给他写信，要求他继续写下去。从白发苍苍，望之令人起敬的印中友好协会会长森德拉尔先生那里，我听到了今年一月初全印和平理事会在马得拉斯举行的“全印争取和平与亚洲人民团结”大会的故事。
  　在那次会议上，来自全国各地的代表们要求正在访问印度的中国文化代表团将这一心意带给中国人民：印度人民将和中国一起为保卫世界和平和争取各民族的自由而奋斗。也是在那次会议上，印度人民通过了要求美国军队从台湾及其附近岛屿和台湾海峡撤退、不许干涉中国人民解放台湾的决议。二月六日就被订为全国要求美军“撤出台湾日”。
    这一天，全国各大城市都举行了会议。大量从个人和团体写给中华人民共和国驻印度大使馆的信表示，只有美军撤出台湾，远东的紧张局势才能缓和。他们说：解放台湾是中国的内政；印度人民向美国高呼：撤出台湾去，不要干涉中国的内政！这以后，在抗议美国准备原子战争的大规模群众运动中，印度人民随时随地都表示了对中国人民解放台湾和恢复中国在联合国席位的关切。
    在国会的中央大厅里，我曾和印度的朋友谈起过三月六日全印度人民的“停止准备原子战争日”。我了解已有百余名议员在反对原子战争的呼吁书上签了名。印度人民清楚地知道，就在二月二十五日的曼谷会议上，杜勒斯还向亚洲人民疯狂挥舞其原子弹。可是，在全印反对美国准备原子战争的怒潮中，却发生了这样一个滑稽的插曲：美国驻印度大使馆新闻处在德里举办的一个所谓“和平使用原子能展览会”开幕了。这是一个何等深刻的讽刺！
    人们自然容易了解，这个展览会的目的，首先是为了欺骗，为了转移人民的视线。谁不知道美国统治者所关心的是原子战争而不是什么和平利用原子能呢？前印度总督拉加高布拉卡里先生最近就连续著文抨击美国的原子战争狂人们，并指出他们高谈所谓和平利用原子能的虚伪。报纸上登载，就在前几天，由于一位美国专家到印度来谈判购买大批猿猴，引起了舆论界的严重注意。人们自然地把美国收买猿猴和它不断进行原子武器的试验联系起来。
  在这几天的时间里，我和中国代表团的同志们访问过的地方是从国会到农村，从学校到家庭。在几乎所有的场合里，你都可以听到“潘池希拉”（Panchshilla）这个名词。这是印地文“五项原则”的意思。的确，印度人民把周总理访印和尼赫鲁总理访华当作一件值得骄傲的事。就是这样，印度名音乐家和诗人、国会议员卡托巴的亚先生所作的“中国印度是兄弟”歌，成了印度人民最喜爱的歌曲之一。人们说：和平共处的五项原则，不仅应当是亚洲人民的共同语言，也应当是全世界各国间相处的准则。亚洲国家会议就是以这个争取和平的内容向世界提出挑战的。
  对于参加亚洲国家会议的代表们，新德里和德里旧城都张起了“欢迎亚洲团结与和平的使者们！”的标语。印度人民怎样重视这一会议的召开，可从印度筹备委员会的成分中看出来。在八十九名各界著名人物中，有五十四位是国会议员。
  现在，十八个亚洲国家的代表们，已经陆续到达了。在开幕及全体大会之后，会议将按政治、经济、科学、社会和文化等项分组讨论，并就各项重要问题作出决议。
  用不着奇怪：在美国、西欧以及亚洲一些资产阶级的报纸上，正出现着各种对于亚洲国家会议的污蔑。这也恰恰说明这一会议的重要性。
  全印和平理事会主席克其鲁博士的一席话是正确的。也是在德里文艺界的联欢会上。克其鲁博士说，全世界都在注视着这个会议。不久将在印度尼西亚参加亚非会议的亚洲各国政府，也在注视这个会议，因为从这个会议所发出的，将是亚洲各国人民坚决反对殖民主义，保卫亚洲和世界和平的一致的声音。　（四月五日）
