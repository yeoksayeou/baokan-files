    Let Agricultural Cooperatives Deploy Production in an Orderly Manner
    The "Seasonal Contract Work and Over-Quota Reward System" of the Hongqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinhui County
    Huang Shirong
    The seasonal contract work and over-quota reward system implemented by the Hongqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhongxin Township, Xinhui County, Guangdong Province in 1954 played a significant role in enhancing the labor enthusiasm of its members.
    The Hongqi Cooperative was established at the beginning of 1954. After implementing a method of temporary work assignments and subjective evaluation for a period, they implemented a more rational short-term contract work system.
    After implementing the short-term contract work system, the cooperative director, Huang Fuhan, no longer needed to be caught up in the chaos of assigning work daily and evaluating performance nightly, and had time to consider some of the problems in the cooperative's development. The team leaders became more proactive and enthusiastic, and the members had a clear idea of the work and were more active in their efforts. However, there were still problems. The short-term contract work system involved contracting for one period and then another; some team leaders waited for the management committee to allocate contract work. Originally, a plan was set for three rounds of weeding in the early rice crop; after the second weeding, the management committee did not promptly formulate and distribute a plan for the third weeding, so the teams stopped and waited. After a few days, the weeds grew densely in the rows, and it was impossible to weed them. In addition, the production teams were organized too small, with only nine people per team, which often made it impossible to "operate independently," and the original organization had to be disrupted during the busy farming season.
    Some members accepted the contract work system only from the perspective of personal gain. Some members thought that after joining the cooperative, the cooperative director and cadres would be responsible for everything, and they could ignore it. Female member Li Chan said, "The best thing about joining the cooperative is that I feel relaxed." At work, some members were fascinated by work points. When weeding, Huang Zhaolun thought while weeding, "If I weed more and faster, I can get more work points"; he didn't care about righting the seedlings that were pushed aside by the weeding tool. When watering, Huang Chengjia avoided the difficult areas and quickly watered the easier areas for a while. After watering an inch of water, he would stop and leave, without inspecting the field dikes or caring if they leaked; after just a few days of watering, the water would leak out, affecting the growth of the rice seedlings. The only people who cared about the growth of the rice seedlings were the cooperative director and a few people who patrolled the fields.
    When the rice seedlings were heading and flowering, the field patrols discovered rice stem borers and told the members. Some members thought that pest control was not part of the contract work and refused to take care of it. Some people said, "A gust of wind and a rain will get rid of them." As a result, the pests multiplied and burrowed into the rice hearts, causing significant damage to the early rice crop.
    Members who cared about the cooperative all demanded improvements to the temporary contract work system. The cooperative director and management committee also constantly considered "how to make the members care about the cooperative and think of ways to improve the cooperative's production." Before the summer harvest, the management committee discussed and compared several forms of contract work systems: short-term contract work, seasonal contract work, and contract work with output quotas. Everyone agreed that short-term contract work improved the members' labor efficiency, but it involved doing one task at a time, and the role of the production team was not fully utilized, and the quality was not guaranteed, so it needed to be improved. Although contract work with output quotas was a good method, everyone was not yet familiar with the field conditions and did not have a grasp of the yield, so it was difficult to implement. Seasonal contract work had a longer duration and could allow the cultivation teams to take independent responsibility, but the shortcoming was still that it was not combined with guaranteeing increased output. Cooperative director Huang Fuhan saw that praising and rewarding some members during the summary of spring plowing work improved the work quality, so he suggested combining the reward system with the contract work system. He said, "It is not frequent enough to praise and reward once after a period of time. If everyone has the opportunity to be rewarded in any work, everyone will care about the cooperative's production." Some management committee members said, "Although contract work with output quotas cannot be implemented at present, it is feasible to adopt the over-quota reward method from contract work with output quotas first." After discussion, everyone agreed to combine seasonal contract work with over-quota rewards, divide the cultivation areas and production teams, and decide to contract all agricultural activities to the production teams from the summer harvest and planting to the autumn harvest, setting targets for increasing rice production. If a team exceeded the production increase target, 50% of the excess would be extracted and rewarded to the members of that team. If the production target was not met, the reasons would be investigated; if it was not due to irresistible disasters, but due to relaxed management and poor labor, it would be criticized.
    Cooperative director Huang Fuhan seized upon the example of pest damage to the rice fields at that time and asked the members, "Why is the pest damage so serious?" Everyone examined the reasons and realized that under the temporary contract work system, the teams contracted for one task at a time and had no long-term plan; the members did one task at a time and did not care enough about the quality of the work; therefore, they did not make pest control preparations in advance, and did not promptly eliminate the pests when they occurred. Cooperative director pointed out that this was the result of everyone not caring enough about the cooperative's production, and it was also a shortcoming of the temporary contract work system. He also compared the "seasonal contract work and over-quota reward," "contract work with output quotas," and "temporary contract work" methods for the members. All the members unanimously agreed to adopt the "seasonal contract work and over-quota reward" method.
    To implement the "seasonal contract work and over-quota reward" method, it was necessary to formulate a summer harvest and planting plan, draft a seasonal contract work plan, organize teams and divide areas, and set production increase targets.
    How to formulate a seasonal contract work plan? They lined up and compared all the work of the cooperative from the summer harvest and planting to the autumn harvest, divided them into three levels of work according to the weight and technical level of the work, and stipulated the quality standards, time, and work points for completing each task. They also learned from the past lesson that the production teams were organized too small and could not adapt to the production needs during the busy farming season, reorganized the three production teams into two production teams, and established three specialized teams for land reclamation, pig raising, and fish pond management, assigning seven committee members and technical workers to the two teams respectively. Each specialized team had one basic member who could be exempt from agricultural production during the busy farming season, and other members could participate in the field production teams. The cultivation team also had basic members who were responsible for patrolling the fields and conducting field management during the slack season, and did not participate in sideline production; other members could participate in sideline production. This ensured that there was sufficient labor to do a good job in agriculture during the busy farming season, and that sideline production was not neglected or missed due to the busy farming season. They also allocated plowing cattle and farm tools to the two teams and fixed the cultivation area.
    When formulating production increase targets, they first mobilized the members to summarize the experience of early rice production, tap production potential, and find the key to production increase. The members saw the favorable conditions for production increase, understood the specific measures for production increase, and unanimously agreed to the production increase targets for late rice. The members understood the production increase targets and knew how to achieve the goals, and were more confident in implementing the over-quota reward method.
    After the cooperative's production increase targets were determined, how would the yields of the two cultivation areas be evaluated? The fields in the second team were generally better, and some members of this team said, "There's no need to evaluate, just leave it as it is, and calculate it at 450 catties per crop." However, some members of the first team had objections, saying, "The second team can get over-quota rewards, our fields are not good, it won't work." In order to correct the tendency to raise the output of other teams and lower the output of their own teams in the evaluation, in addition to educating cadres and members to overcome departmentalism, they also divided the land of the cooperative into six plots, extracted high-yield fields and special fields from each plot, and found one plot that was close to the planned average yield as a standard plot, and compared the other five plots with the standard plot to evaluate the yield targets for each plot. In order to prevent the teams from concentrating their efforts on one plot and neglecting the other plots, and to ensure that all fields increased production, it was stipulated that the production increase target of each team referred to the average of each plot in the team, and only those who exceeded this average would be rewarded; those who only increased production in one plot and did not exceed the average of each plot would not be rewarded.
    How to lead the team's production well and ensure the realization of the production increase plan became a question that the backbone members of the two teams often considered and studied. Huang Xiuzhen, the leader of the first team, said, "The responsibility is really not light now! We can't do one thing at a time like we used to." She took the initiative to find the cooperative director and members to study the yield of the fields piece by piece and make plans for the team's cultivation, weeding, and fertilization for each piece of land. Deputy Director Huang Yaonan assisted team leader Huang Yuandu in forming a central team in the second team. During rice planting, they divided into watering, cattle-driving, seedling-pulling, and rice-planting teams, and cooperated. This saved time and labor and improved leadership methods. The two teams had already planned the second weeding and fertilization work before the first weeding was completed. The leader of the second team said, "Now I am really acting as a team leader."
    All the members implemented the production increase plan with high labor enthusiasm. At first, they encountered a drought during rice planting, and then heavy rain flooded the fields. However, they still finished planting two days ahead of schedule. After the rice seedlings were planted, there was heavy rain again, submerging the rice tails. After the rain, the whole team immediately went out to replant the seedlings. When cultivating, weeding, and removing insects, the members took better care of the rice seedlings. Whoever saw a rice stem borer in the field would chase it to the neighboring field and kill it. In order to strive for over-quota production increase, the members also gradually attached importance to learning advanced cultivation techniques and agricultural scientific knowledge.
    The production management work was done well, and the cooperative was further consolidated. Female member Gan Li had a "wait and see" attitude when she joined the cooperative and had thought about quitting halfway; after the implementation of the seasonal contract work and over-quota reward method, she said that she no longer thought that way. She was responsible for raising pigs in the cooperative, and she carefully fed them every day, raising the meat pigs fat and strong, and the piglets fat and clean. The members' sense of loving the cooperative like their own home gradually grew.
    Now, this cooperative has implemented a system of year-round contract work and output quotas. The "seasonal contract work and over-quota reward system" implemented in 1954 prepared certain conditions for the implementation of the output quota system. Agricultural production cooperatives that already feel that short-term contract work cannot meet their needs and members urgently demand improvement, but it is not yet possible or they are unwilling to implement the output quota system, can refer to the experience of the Hongqi Cooperative and implement this transitional method first.

    让农业合作社有秩序地投放生产
    新会县红旗农业生产合作社的“季节包工超额奖励制”
    黄史荣
    广东省新会县中心乡红旗农业生产合作社一九五四年实行的季节包工、超额奖励制，对于提高社员劳动积极性起了很大作用。
    红旗社是一九五四年年初建立起来的。他们实行了一个时期临时派工、死分活评的办法以后，就实行了更加合理的短期包工制。
    实行了短期包工制后，社主任黄扶汉不用再陷在天天派工、晚晚评分的忙乱当中了，有时间来考虑社的发展中的一些问题了；小组长主动积极起来了；社员对工作心中有数，干活也更积极了。但是，还有毛病。短期包工制是包了一段再包一段的；一些小组长等着管理委员会分配包工活。原来定了早稻中耕除草三次的计划；除了第二次草之后，管理委员会还没有及时地把第三次除草包工方案定出来分下去，各个小组也就停下来等着。隔了几天，禾生密了行，想除也不能除了。加上生产小组编得过小，每组只有九人，往往不能“单独作战”，农忙时不得不打乱原来的组织。
    一些社员只是从个人利益出发来接受包工制的。还有一些社员以为入了社什么都有社主任、社干部负责了，自己可以不过问了。女社员李婵说：“入了社，最好的是一身轻松。”在工作时，有些社员的心眼就给工分迷住了。黄兆伦在除草时一边除草一边想：“多除快除一些，就可以多拿工分”；秧苗被除草工具推倒在一边，他也不管不扶。黄成佳在车水时，难车的地方就不去车，不难车的就赶快车一会儿。车满了一寸水，抽起车就走了，田基也不巡，漏了也不管；刚车了几天，水就漏光了，影响了禾苗的生长。关心禾苗生长的，只有社主任和巡田的几个人。
    在禾苗抽穗扬花时，巡田的人发现了白翼仔（螟虫），回来告诉社员。一些社员认为除虫不是包下来的工作，不肯去管。有人说：“吹一场风，落一场雨就没有了。”就是这样，害虫繁殖起来了，钻进了禾心，早稻受到很大的损失。
    关心合作社的社员都要求改善临时包工制。社主任和管理委员也经常考虑着“怎样才能使社员都关心社，都想办法来搞好社的生产”。夏收前，管理委员会讨论、对比了短期包工、季节包工、包工包产这几种包工制的形式。大家认为：短期包工制提高了社员劳动效率，但包一段做一段，包一件做一件，生产组的作用没有发挥，质量缺少保证，是需要改善的。包工包产虽然是个好办法，但大家对田亩情况还不熟悉，对产量还没有把握，不好办。季节包工时间较长，可以发挥耕作小组独立负责的作用，但缺点仍然是没有同保证提高产量结合起来。社主任黄扶汉看到在总结春耕工作中表扬、奖励了一些社员，工作质量就提高了，就建议把奖励制度和包工制度结合起来。他说：“经过一段时间才表扬、奖励一次，不够经常。如果使大家在任何工作中都有得到奖励的机会，大家就会关心社的生产了。”一些管理委员说：“包工包产目前虽然不能行，但先采用包工包产中的超额奖励办法，是可以行得通的。”大家讨论以后，都同意把季节包工和超额奖励结合起来，划分耕作区和生产队，并决定从夏收夏种开始，到秋收为止，把所有农事活动包给生产队，定出稻田增产指标。那一队超过了增产指标，抽出超额部分的五成奖励给那一队的队员。达不到产量指标，就要检查原因；如果不是因为不可抗拒的灾害，而是因为放松管理，劳动不好，就要批评。
    社主任黄扶汉抓紧当时禾田虫害的事例，向社员们提出：“为什么虫害会这样严重呢？”大家检查了原因，认识到：在实行临时包工的情况下，小组包一段做一段，没有长期计划；社员做一件算一件，对工作质量不够关心；因此，预先没有做好防虫准备工作，发生虫害时又没有及时扑灭。社主任指出这是大家对社的生产不够关心的结果，也是临时包工制还有缺点。他又向社员把“季节包工、超额奖励”“包工包产”和“临时包工”这几种办法作了比较。全体社员一致同意采用“季节包工、超额奖励”的办法。
    要实行“季节包工、超额奖励”的办法，就必须制定夏收夏种计划，拟定季节包工方案，编队划区，定出增产指标。
    怎样制定季节包工方案呢？他们把全社从夏收夏种到秋收的各种工作排队、比较，按照工作的轻重和技术高低分成三等工，又规定了每一种工作的质量标准、时间和完成每项工作应得的工分。他们还接受了过去生产组编得过小，不能适应农忙时生产需要的教训，把三个生产组改编成两个生产队，并且设立了开荒、养猪、管理鱼塘三个专业小组，把七个委员和技术工，分别搭配在两个队里。每个专业小组设基本组员一人，农忙时他可以不参加农业生产，别的组员可参加田间生产队。耕作队也设基本队员，在农闲时专责巡田、进行田间管理，不参加副业生产；别的队员可以参加副业生产。这样可以保证农忙时有足够的劳动力搞好农业，又能保证副业生产不因农忙而疏忽或漏掉。他们还把耕牛、农具分配给两个队，把耕作区划分固定。
    在制定增产指标时，先发动社员总结了早稻生产经验，挖掘生产潜力，找出增产关键。社员们看到了增产的有利条件，明白了增产的具体措施，一致同意了晚稻的增产指标。社员们了解了增产指标，又知道了怎样达到目标，对于实行超额奖励办法更有信心了。
    全社增产的指标确定了，两个耕作区的产量怎样评定呢？第二队的田一般比较好，这个队有的社员就说：“不用评了，就这样吧，按一造四百五十斤计算。”可是第一队有的社员有意见，他们说：“第二队可以得到超额奖励，我们田不好，不行。”为了纠正在评产中提高别队产量和压低本队产量的偏向，除了教育干部社员克服本位主义思想外，他们还把全社的土地划分为六片，每一片抽出丰产田和特殊的田，找出接近计划平均产量的一片为标准片，拿其他五片和标准片比较，评定了各片产量的指标。为了防止队内集中力量搞好一片放松其余各片，保证全部田亩增产，规定各队的增产指标是指队内各片的平均数，超过了这个平均数才奖励；只是其中一片增产，各片平均数不超过者不奖励。
    如何领导好队的生产，保证增产计划的实现，成了两个队的骨干分子经常考虑研究的问题。第一队队长黄秀贞说：“现在责任真不轻哩！再不能像过去那样做一段等一段了。”她主动找社主任和队员逐块地研究田亩的产量，做出队内的各个片的中耕、除草、施肥计划。副主任黄耀南在第二队协助队长黄元渡组成了中心小组。在插田时分成车水、使牛、拔秧、插田等小组，分工合作。这样做，节省了时间和劳动力，改进了领导方法。两个队在没有除完第一次草时就计划好第二次除草、施肥的工作了。第二队队长说：“现在是真正当起队长来了。”
    全体社员以高涨的劳动热情来执行增产计划。插田时最初碰到了天旱，后来又落了大雨，田被水浸了。可是，他们仍然提前两天插完了。插了秧以后，又落了大雨，浸没了禾尾。雨后，全队马上出动补苗。中耕除草除虫的时候，社员们对禾苗更加爱护，谁在田上看到了一只螟虫，飞到了邻田也要追过去把它扑灭。为了争取超额增产，社员们还逐渐地重视了学习先进的耕作技术和农业科学知识。
    生产管理工作做好了，社也进一步巩固起来了。女社员甘丽入社时抱着“试试看”的态度，曾想半路退社；实行季节包工、超额奖励的办法以后，她说她不再那样想了。她在社里负责养猪，每天都小心地喂养，把肉猪养得肥头大脑，小猪养得又肥又干净。社员们爱社如家的思想逐渐地成长起来了。
    现在，这个社已经实行了常年包工包产的制度。一九五四年实行的“季节包工超额奖励制”，为实行包产制准备了一定的条件。已经感到短期包工不能满足需要，社员迫切要求改进，但还不可能或者不愿意实行包产制的农业生产合作社，都可以参考红旗社的经验，先实行这种过渡的办法。
