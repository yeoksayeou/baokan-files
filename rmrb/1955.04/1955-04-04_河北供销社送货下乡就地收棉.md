Hebei Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Send Goods to the Countryside and Collect Cotton Locally

Recently, supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Hebei Province have adopted the method of "sending goods to the countryside and collecting cotton locally," acquiring large quantities of cotton. The Shijiazhuang Special District organized 150 work groups to go to the countryside to purchase cotton and supply goods. From February 16th to 20th, the average daily cotton purchase volume increased by 3.7 times compared to the average daily purchase volume from February 1st to 5th. The Chengguan Supply and Marketing Cooperative of the Fifth District of Jin County organized three teams to go to the countryside to purchase cotton. On March 3rd and 4th, they purchased nearly 40,000 jin of seed cotton, which was twice the average daily purchase volume of the previous stage. The nine cotton collection stations in Xingtai County organized twelve mobile teams combining supply and marketing, focusing on publicity and mobilization for agricultural production cooperatives and households with large cotton reserves, and organized sales from point to area. In seventeen days during February, they purchased more than 200,000 jin of seed cotton. In addition, supply and marketing cooperatives in the Cang County Special District also purchased a batch of cotton through methods such as holding materials exchange meetings.

Due to the strengthening of the unified cotton purchase work, the amount of cotton purchased in Hebei Province has increased significantly recently. The average daily purchase of ginned cotton in the province was 500,000 jin in early February, and the average daily purchase in late February was 1,000,000 jin, an increase of 100%. At present, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in the province are continuing to purchase cotton in conjunction with spring plowing production work.

    河北供销社送货下乡就地收棉
    河北省各地供销合作社最近采取“送货下乡、就地收棉”的办法，收购到大批棉花。石家庄专区组织了一百五十个工作组，下乡收购棉花，供应货物，在二月十六日到二十日每天平均收购到的棉花，比二月一日到五日的每天平均收购量增加三点七倍。晋县第五区城关供销合作社组织三个小组下乡收购棉花，在三月三、四两日收购籽棉近四万斤，比前一阶段每日平均收购量提高两倍。邢台县九个收棉站组织十二个供销结合的流动小组，对农业生产合作社和存棉多的户重点进行了宣传动员，由点到面地组织出售，在二月内的十七天中，就收购籽棉二十多万斤。另外，沧县专区的供销合作社通过举行物资交流会等办法，也收购了一批棉花。
    由于加强了棉花统购工作，河北省近来收购棉花的数量显著上升。全省在二月初每天平均收购皮棉五十万斤，二月底平均每天收购一百万斤，增加了一倍。目前，该省各级供销合作社正在结合春耕生产工作，继续收购棉花。
