To the Editor:

    We are fishermen from the coastal areas of Zhejiang. The issue of safety in our fishing production has not been resolved. In less than three months this year, two major "maritime loss" accidents have already occurred. These accidents not only affect the lives of the families of the deceased, but also affect the production enthusiasm of the general fishermen. Many fishermen become passive and unmotivated after each "maritime loss" accident, which is a serious problem. However, the person in charge of the aquatic products department believes that in the case of backward technology, "maritime loss" accidents are unavoidable.

    Editor, are "maritime loss" accidents really unavoidable? I believe that if the relevant leading departments regard safe production as a major issue, conduct regular safety education for fishermen going out to sea, and strengthen command work, the safety of maritime production can be improved. We urgently request that the department in charge of fisheries production in the Wenzhou Special District treat this urgent issue with a positive attitude.
    
    On Investigation of "Maritime Loss" Accidents in the Wenzhou Area

    From May 14, 1954, to March 12 this year, three major "maritime loss" accidents occurred successively in the Wenzhou area. The direct cause of the accidents was strong winds of level eight to nine, or even above level ten, while the fishermen who went out to sea could not get typhoon warnings in advance.

    For this matter, our reporter conducted an investigation. The person in charge of the aquatic products department, when describing the "maritime loss" accidents, emphasized that there were too many objective difficulties, believing that under extremely difficult conditions of technology and equipment, it was impossible for the office on land to command ships on the ocean. But what did the fishermen and boat captains say? They said: Now that fishing production cooperatives and mutual aid groups have been established, and production competitions have been launched, everyone does not pay enough attention to safety issues, and accidents have increased. On the second day after the liberation of Upper and Lower Dachen Islands in February this year, the first, second, and third fishing production cooperatives of Shitang Town, Wenling County, organized their members to fish in the Dachen sea area. At that time, experienced fishermen had foreseen signs of weather changes, but the leaders of the cooperative put forward the slogan: "Take on the hard wind, seize the tail wind" (that is, brace the wind and insist on production when a strong wind comes, and continue production even when the wind has not stopped; often there are more fish in the head and tail of the wind). This is a typical slogan that emphasizes production but not safety. The county and district departments in charge of fisheries production did not correct this mistake in time, resulting in an attack by level eight or nine strong winds, killing eleven cooperative members and leaving seventeen missing. According to boat captain Lin Shunsheng, although there are many storms at sea, safe production can be achieved if attention is paid to operation. Lin Shunsheng is fifty-seven years old this year and has been engaged in maritime production for thirty-eight years. The fishing boat he leads has never had an accident. He said: To achieve safe production, the first is to educate fishermen and all workers to be careful and patient in operation, to be prepared before going to sea, and also to organize technical exchanges, so that everyone who goes to sea pays attention to technology. Once the technology is proficient, the danger will be reduced; if there is a change at sea (such as the direction of the tide is chaotic, there are special changes in the sky), immediately return to the port or transfer to a safe area to avoid it. However, the fisheries leadership department in the Wenzhou Special District has never held a special meeting on the issue of safety in fisheries production. When fishermen's meetings are held in various counties, this issue is rarely mentioned, and only a notice is given after an accident occurs. After the notice, no one cares about it.

    In order to protect the safety of coastal fishermen, in addition to strengthening safety education for fishermen, it is also necessary to improve their production tools. Before the liberation of coastal islands such as Dachen, Pishan, and Nanfu, most fishing boats were only suitable for offshore operations due to the enemy's blockade and persecution of fishermen in the Wenzhou area. After the liberation of islands such as Dachen and Pishan, fishermen's opportunities for ocean-going operations increased, but fishermen faced many problems in adding and repairing ropes and tools. Therefore, timely inspection and repair of tools are particularly important. In order to ensure the safe production of fishermen, the relevant leaders in the Wenzhou area should emphasize less on objective difficulties and make more subjective efforts.

### 温州专区应重视渔民的安全生产

    温州专区应重视渔民的安全生产编辑同志：
    我们是浙江沿海的渔民。我们这里渔业生产上的安全问题一直没有解决。在今年不到三个月的期间，已经发生了重大的“海损”事故两次。这种事故，既影响了死难者家属的生活，又影响了一般渔民的生产积极性。有不少的渔民，在每次“海损”事故以后，就消极起来，不积极生产了，这是一个严重的问题。可是，水产部门的负责人却认为在技术落后的情况下，“海损”事故是难以避免的。
    编辑同志，难道“海损”事故真的不可避免吗？我认为如果有关领导部门，把安全生产看成是一件大事，对下海的渔民进行经常的安全教育，加强指挥工作，是能够增进海上生产的安全的。我们迫切要求温州专区领导渔业生产的部门用积极的态度，来对待这个迫切的问题。　张恒德　李四宝
    关于温州地区“海损”事故的调查
    从一九五四年五月十四日起到今年三月十二日止，温州地区曾先后发生了三次较大的“海损”事故。造成事故的直接原因，都是海上起了八级至九级甚至十级以上的大风，而下海的渔民不能事先得到大风警报。
    为了这件事，本报记者进行了一次调查。水产部门的负责人在叙述“海损”事故时，强调客观困难太多，认为在技术、设备极度困难的条件下，机关在陆地，要指挥海洋上的船只，是没办法做到的。可是渔民和船老大又怎么说呢？他们说：现在办了渔业生产合作社和互助组，展开了生产竞赛，可是对安全问题大家却注意不够，事故变多了。今年二月上下大陈岛解放后的第二天，温岭县石塘镇第一、第二、第三渔业生产合作社就组织社员去大陈海面捕鱼。当时，有经验的渔民已预感到天气变化的征兆，但是社的领导人员却提出了：“硬风头、抢风尾”的口号（就是大风来了硬一硬，坚持生产，风未停息也要生产；往往在风头风尾鱼比较多）。这是典型的重生产不重安全的口号。县区领导渔业生产的部门并未及时纠正这种错误，以致遭到八、九级大风的袭击，死难社员十一名，失踪十七人。据船老大林顺生表示，海上的风暴虽然很多，如果注意操作，是可以做到安全生产的。林顺生今年五十七岁，在海上生产已有三十八年的历史，他领导的渔船从来没有出过一次险。他说：要做到安全生产，第一是要教育渔民和全体工人在操作中仔细耐心，出海之前要有准备，并且还要组织技术交流，使每个下海的人都讲究技术，技术一熟练，危险就会减少了；如遇海上有变化（如潮水流向乱了、天空有特殊变化），立刻要赶回港埠或者转到安全地带躲避。可是温州专区的渔业领导部门，从来没有专门为渔业生产的安全问题开过一次会。在各县召开渔民会议的时候，也很少说到这个问题，只有在发生了事故以后，来一次通报。通报以后，也就没有人过问了。
    为了保障沿海渔民的安全，除了加强渔民的安全教育以外，必须同时改善他们的生产工具。在大陈、披山、南凫等沿海岛屿未解放以前，由于敌人对温州地区渔民的封锁和迫害，大部渔船只适用于在近海作业，大陈、披山等岛屿解放以后，渔民的远洋作业机会增加了，但渔民在绳索工具的增添和修补方面却存在不少问题。因此，及时检查和修补工具，就显得特别重要了。为了保证渔民的安全生产，温州地区有关领导方面，应该少强调客观困难，多作些主观努力。
