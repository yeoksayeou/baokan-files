　　Crops Grow Well at Lhasa and Other Experimental Farms
　　This year, the Lhasa Agricultural Experiment Farm has cultivated more than 80 mu of land, experimenting with planting more than 400 varieties of crops and vegetables. The spring wheat that was sown first has already emerged from the soil; dozens of varieties of vegetables and melon seedlings transplanted to cold frames and open fields have survived and turned green; tomatoes and peppers cultivated in greenhouses have begun to blossom and bear fruit; winter wheat has been cultivated; and more than 200 newly planted apple seedlings and more than 100,000 poplar and willow trees in the nursery this spring have begun to sprout.
　　At the Rikaze Agricultural Experiment Farm, on the banks of the Yarlung Zangbo River, more than 3,800 meters above sea level, more than 100 varieties of food and cash crops have been sown, the watermelon vines cultivated in hotbeds have begun to spread, and the head cabbage has begun to curl. More than 5,000 tree seedlings have been cultivated in the nursery. The first animal-drawn waterwheel in the Rikaze area is irrigating the spring wheat that was just sown in the experimental farm.

    拉萨等试验场农作物生长良好
      拉萨农业试验场今年耕种了八十多亩土地，试种了四百多种品种的作物和蔬菜。最先下种的春小麦已经出土；移植到冷床和露天的几十种蔬菜和瓜苗，已经成活发绿；温室培育的蕃茄、辣椒已开花结果；冬小麦进行了中耕；苗圃里今春新栽种的二百多棵苹果苗和十多万株杨树、柳树，开始发芽。
    在拔海三千八百多公尺的雅鲁藏布江边，日喀则农业试验场试种的一百多种品种的粮食和经济作物已全部播种完毕，温床培育的西瓜已经吐蔓，莲花白开始卷心。五千多株树苗栽培到苗圃里。日喀则地区第一部马拉水车，正在车水浇灌试验场刚播下的春小麦。（据新华社讯）
