    Construction Begins on New Datong Cement Plant
    Construction of the new Datong Cement Plant officially began on April 15th. This is the first highly mechanized cement factory newly built in our country. Auxiliary factories needed for the construction project, such as the concrete mixing station, hardware processing plant, metal structure processing plant, and saw mill, are being established or are about to be established. Various machines will also be used extensively during construction.

    After the Datong Cement Plant is completed, its entire production process will be mechanized. The number of personnel required for production will be two-thirds less than that of existing cement plants of the same size in our country. The chief engineer can learn about all production conditions and mechanical operation conditions at any time from various instruments in the central control room. Workers at rotary kilns in ordinary cement plants have to work beside the high-temperature kilns, while workers operating the rotary kilns at this plant only need to operate from a distance. In order to avoid dust harming workers, this plant will adopt wet production methods. The conveying of cement and pulverized coal will also be carried out entirely by compressed air, and various vacuum cleaners are installed in every corner of the workshop. In severe winter, warm air fans will continuously blow hot air to the workers for warmth.

    新建大同水泥厂开始施工
    新建的大同水泥厂在四月十五日正式施工，这是我国新建的第一个高度机械化的水泥工厂。建厂工程所需的混凝土搅拌站、五金加工厂、金属结构加工厂、火锯厂等附属工厂正在建立或即将建立。施工中并将广泛使用各种机械。
    大同水泥厂建成后，它的生产过程将全部是机械化的。生产所需的人员将比我国现有的同样大的水泥厂少三分之二。总工程师在中央控制室里可以从各种仪表上随时了解到一切生产情况和机械运转情况。一般水泥厂回转窑工人要在高温的窑旁来劳动，而这个厂操纵回转窑的工人只需在远方操作就行了。为了避免粉尘伤害工人，这个厂将采用湿法生产。水泥和煤粉等的输送也将完全用压缩空气来进行，每个车间的角落里并设有各种吸尘器。在严冬里，暖风扇将不断地向工人吹送热风取暖。
