    Should Stop Him
    Peng Ding'an

    During the Spring Festival of 1954, the news that the Liu family, the wealthiest household in Jiming Temple Village, Liaoyang County, Liaoning Province, was moving into the city caused quite a bit of speculation and discussion in the village. Liu Zhizhong, the son of old man Liu and acting deputy director of the Liaoyang City and County Grain Bureau, specifically returned to arrange the relocation, leaving an even deeper impression on people's minds.

    On the evening of the first day of the Lunar New Year, acting Deputy Director Liu announced to the villagers: "Our family is moving to the city. There are no mutual aid teams or cooperatives in our village, so let you all farm the land. It won't be to your disadvantage. You can give us some after the autumn harvest, or you don't have to. If you do give, then 'two-eight' rent it is!"

    The peasants present understood in their hearts that the most important part of these words was the last sentence. This time, the Liu family was moving to the city, and the garden plot next to the house required one *shi* of rent; the four *mu* of land in front of the house was operated by hired labor; how could these fourteen or fifteen *mu* of land be farmed for free! Besides, trying to farm their land without giving rent? What kind of people were the old Liu family!

    But they couldn't figure it out: why was the old Liu family moving to the city at this time? So, people began to discuss:

    "Everyone says the General Line is good, and cooperativization is good, but the old Liu family got scared and ran away."

    "He's really wearing a new calico gown and taking the old path!"

    This metaphor made sense. It meant that although Liu Zhizhong was a Communist Party member and a cadre in a government agency who had sworn "to struggle for communism to the end," he was, in his family, helping his father to speculate and take advantage, walking the path of a rich peasant. Is there any basis for saying this? Yes, there is. Let's look at the facts:

    In December 1947, Liu Zhizhong, the son of a middle peasant, joined the revolutionary work. He worked as a finance and grain assistant in the Liangjia District Government of Liaoyang County. In his second year of participating in the revolution – 1948 – he used public funds to help his family engage in speculation and profiteering. In his third year, he became the deputy district head and had authority. Relying on this authority, he created even greater "achievements" in helping his family's "business":

    His father proposed opening a cart inn and selling groceries in the village where the Liangjia District Government was located. He agreed and put forward the following plan: to avoid attracting attention, his father would still farm at home, and the shop would be opened by others as a joint venture.

    "With me working in the district, who would let you suffer a loss!" He convinced his father.

    So, they chose an auspicious day to open the shop, and the business was quite prosperous. About a month after the opening, a supply and marketing cooperative was established. The people in the shop thought this was very "detrimental" to their business, so they ran to the district head to complain: "Once the cooperative is established, our business will be affected." Liu Zhizhong comforted the businessmen, saying, "It doesn't matter; we can expand the shares and recruit enough fifty households to become a cooperative in name." So the businessmen did as he said. Deputy District Head Liu then came up with another trick: using his position as deputy district head to attract customers for the private merchants, telling them to buy high and sell low first, and then turn around and buy low and sell high after the customers were attracted. This was called "retreating before advancing." This method did work, and some customers were attracted. But after retreating regardless of the "capital," they retreated for a month or two, and before they could turn around and take a bite, they ruined their own business.

    Although the business collapsed, his father, Liu Jiwen, used the money he had earned from dealing in wood and scrap goods to buy a rubber-wheeled cart on his own and jointly owned another with someone else, and used these carts to speculate heavily in wood. At this time, the People's Government had strictly prohibited wood speculation. Once, Liu Jiwen's cart carrying illegally traded timber was seized in Xiangshanzi Village, and the local People's Government confiscated his timber. He found his son Liu Zhizhong, who was the deputy district head, and Liu Zhizhong wrote him a letter, which was effective, and the cart was "allowed to pass."

    In this way, Liu Jiwen had quite a bit of money in his hands. He decided to try opening a shop again. Of course, he consulted with his son.

    Did the son realize something and tell his father to settle down? No. He said, "Private industry and commerce are still allowed to develop." And he helped plan, saying that they should open a flour mill and buy a pulverizer in the future, and the business would become increasingly prosperous.

    The business was opened in the city. At this time, Liu Zhizhong, who had been promoted to district head of the Emei District, had to put in some effort to assist. When the district had a batch of surplus rations left over from the dam construction workers that were about to be disposed of, Liu Jiwen, the owner of the flour mill and district head Liu Zhizhong's father, came to the Emei District in time and bought the grain, earning more than two million yuan (old currency) in the process.

    In 1952, the great "Three-Anti" Movement arrived. Liu Zhizhong foresaw the seriousness of his problems, so at the beginning of the movement, he quickly told his father to close the business, return to the countryside, and hurriedly wrote letters to the village branch secretary, village cadres, and his father, expressing that his father should join the mutual aid team, etc. This was his clever way of trying to cover up his mistakes.

    But he ultimately failed to escape this movement. He was taken as a typical target of criticism in the movement. He wept bitterly at the meeting and confessed: "I want to strengthen my proletarian ideology and resolutely struggle against bourgeois ideology. I am determined to be a Communist Party member who meets the standards." The words were beautiful enough. But what about afterwards?

    Even in 1952, Liu Jiwen still rented out all his land and carts, and he himself engaged in live pig trading, evading taxes. In 1953, two carts were rented out, and several million yuan in usurious loans were issued at interest rates of four and seven *fen*.

    By the end of 1953, just as the Party's General Line for the transition period was being widely publicized, Liu Zhizhong, who had already been promoted to acting deputy director of the Grain Bureau, returned home to help his father arrange the relocation. Before moving into the city, their family sold a large amount of grain to private merchants; spent more than 30 million yuan to acquire five and a half brick houses in the city; and bought a small rubber-wheeled cart and a donkey.

    We do not know how Liu Zhizhong and his father originally planned their activities after entering the city. But after entering the city, they were "lying low." Because not long after entering the city, the Liaoyang County Party Committee began to investigate Liu Zhizhong's wrongdoings.

    Why would Liu Zhizhong, as a Communist Party member, act like this? According to himself, he had a kind of "gratitude thought." But how did he "repay" it? – By helping and supporting his father to speculate and exploit, taking the path of the landlords and rich peasants who had exploited him in the past. In his own words, it was: "My capitalist exploitation thinking has become a habit." Liu Zhizhong also made some "self-criticisms": "The essence of this kind of thinking is reactionary, the purpose is selfish, the behavior is hypocritical, and the inside story is dark, and it cannot see the sun," etc. But like the words he said during the "Three-Anti" Movement, these words were also insincere. In the process of investigating his wrongdoings, he wrote many materials. Sometimes he said he "really can't remember"; sometimes he said: "It was all my father who did it, I didn't know," or "I only just now inquired about it"; sometimes he even made a move: requesting the organization to approve his severing of relations with his father. He even searched all the cadres and peasants who knew about his affairs, inquired about news, and probed for information, in order to continue to conceal the truth from the organization. This is truly a very dangerous road for him. He should be stopped: Honestly confess!

    应该喝住他
    彭定安
    一九五四年春节，辽宁省辽阳县鸡鸣寺村的首户刘家搬进城的消息，在村子里很引起了一些猜测和议论。老刘头的儿子，辽阳市、县粮食局代理副局长刘志忠特地回来安排搬家事宜，更在人们心里留下了深刻的印象。
    旧历正月初一晚上，刘代理副局长向村邻们宣布：“我们家搬进城去啦，咱们村没有互助组，又没有合作社，地给你们种吧。还能叫你们吃亏啦，秋后给点也行，不给也行，要给就‘二八’租吧！”
    在座的农民心里明白：这番话里最重要的是末尾一句话。这次刘家搬家进城，屋边的园子地要了一石租；门前的四亩地雇工经营；这十四五亩土地还能白给种啦！再说，种他们的地不给租还行啦，老刘家是什么人家！
    但是他们想不透：为什么在这时候老刘家要搬到城里去？于是有人议论开了：
    “都说总路线好，合作化好，可是老刘家却吓跑啦。”
    “他真是穿新大布衫走老路！”
    这个比喻是有道理的。这是说刘志忠虽然是共产党员，政府机关的干部，曾经宣誓过“要为共产主义奋斗到底”的，但在家庭里，却帮助他父亲投机取巧，走富农的路。这样说有根据吗？有的。让我们看看事实吧：
    一九四七年十二月，刘志忠，一个中农的儿子，参加了革命工作。他在辽阳县亮甲区政府当财粮助理。在他参加革命的第二年——一九四八年，他就动用公款，帮助了家庭投机倒把。第三年他当上了副区长，有了职权。靠了这职权，他便在帮助家庭的“事业”上创造更大的“成绩”：
    他的父亲提议在亮甲区政府所在村开大车店兼卖杂货。他同意了，而且提出这样的方案：为了避人耳目，父亲仍在家种地，和人合股，由别人出面开店。
    “有我在区上工作，谁还能给亏吃呢！”他说服了他的父亲。
    于是择吉开张，生意相当兴隆。开张一个来月，一个供销合作社成立了。店里人认为这很“有碍”自己的买卖，于是跑到区长那儿去诉“苦”：“合作社一成立，咱买卖受影响。”刘志忠安慰商人说：“不要紧，我们可以扩大股金，招满五十户也可以变成合作社名义。”于是商人们照办了。刘副区长接着又出计谋：以副区长的身份给私商拉主顾，叫私商先来个贵买贱卖，等主顾拉到后再反过来贱买贵卖。这叫做“欲进先退”。这方法的确见效，主顾拉到一些了。但不顾“血本”地后退，退了一两个月，等不到回头来反咬一口，自己却把买卖弄垮了。
    买卖虽然垮了，但他的父亲刘纪文又用自己捣弄木材、破烂货赚来的钱，独自拴了一辆胶皮轱辘车，又和别人合股拴了一辆，就用这大车，大肆捣弄木材。这时，人民政府已经严禁木材投机了。有一次刘纪文私贩木料的大车在响山子村被查获了，当地人民政府扣留了他的木材。他找到当副区长的儿子刘志忠，刘志忠给他写了一封信，果然见效，大车“准予放行”了。
    就这样，刘纪文手里很有几文了。他决心再试一试开店。当然又和儿子商量啰。
    做儿子的是否稍稍觉悟一些，叫父亲收收心呢？没有。他说：“现在私营工商业还允许发展。”并帮助计划，说开磨面铺吧，将来还可以买一个粉碎机，生意会日益兴隆的。
    买卖在城里开起来了。这时已升任峨嵋区区长的刘志忠又少不得出力协助了。当区上有一批修坝民工余下的口粮准备处理时，磨面铺的老板、区长刘志忠的父亲刘纪文，便及时来到了峨嵋区，收买了这批粮食，过手之间就赚了二百多万元（旧币，下同）。
    一九五二年，伟大的“三反”运动来了。刘志忠预感到自己问题的严重性，于是在运动开始时，就赶紧叫父亲收拾了买卖，回到乡下，并且赶忙给村支部书记、村干部、父亲写信，表示要父亲参加互助组等等。这是他企图掩盖错误的巧妙手法。
    但他究竟没能躲过这一场运动。他被当作运动中的典型批判对象。他痛哭流涕地在大会上检讨：“我要坚定我无产阶级的思想，坚决向资产阶级思想作斗争。我坚决做一个够标准的共产党员。”话是说得够漂亮的。可是事后呢？
    就在一九五二年，刘纪文仍然把全部土地出租、大车出租，自己则做活猪买卖，偷税漏税。一九五三年，两辆大车出租，又放出四分、七分的高利贷数百万元。
    到了一九五三年末，正当广泛宣传党在过渡时期的总路线的时候，已经调升为粮食局代理副局长的刘志忠，却回家来帮助他父亲安排搬家事宜来了。在进城前，他们家庭把大批的粮食卖给私商；花三千多万元在城市置下五间半瓦房；还买了一辆小胶皮车，一匹驴。
    刘志忠父子关于进城后的活动，原来是如何计划的，我们不得而知。但他们进城后却是“按兵不动”。因为进城不久，中共辽阳县委便开始调查刘志忠的错误行为了。
    作为一个共产党员的刘志忠，为什么竟会这样呢？据他自己说，他有一种“报恩思想”。但他怎么“报”法呢？——帮助、支持父亲投机、剥削，走从前剥削过他自己的地主、富农的路。用他自己的话来说，就是：“我资本主义剥削思想已成为习惯了。”刘志忠也做过一些“自我批评”：“这种思想的本质是反动的，目的是自私的，行为是虚伪的，内幕是黑暗的，是见不得太阳的”，等等。但像“三反”运动时他说过的话一样，这些话也是言不由衷的。在调查他的错误事实的过程中，他写了多次的材料。有时他说他“实在记不起来了”；有时他说：“都是我父亲干的，我不知道”，或者是“我现在才追问出来”；有时还来这么一手：请求组织批准他和父亲脱离关系。他甚至找遍了知道他的事情的干部和农民，打听消息，探听口风，以便继续向组织隐瞒事实真相。这对于他真是一条十分危险的道路。应该喝住他：老老实实地交代吧！
