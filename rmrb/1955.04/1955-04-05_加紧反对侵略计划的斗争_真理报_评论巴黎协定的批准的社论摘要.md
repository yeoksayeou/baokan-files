Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd: TASS reports: The "Pravda" published an editorial on the 2nd entitled "Intensify the Struggle Against Aggression Plans," commenting on the ratification of the Paris Agreements. The summary is as follows:

    The ratification of the Paris Agreements has changed the international situation. It allows West German revanchists to begin building a 500,000-strong core force and to equip this army with all kinds of modern weapons. West German monopoly capital is already turning the entire West German economy, including the Ruhr economy, to a military track. Previously, the ruling clique of the Bonn Republic and its American protectors could not have taken such blatant actions, but the Paris Agreements gave them this possibility. That is to say, the situation has undergone a major change. The door to the revival of German militarism has been opened, and the danger of a new war is increasing.

    The ratification of the Paris Agreements will have a very serious impact on Soviet-French and Soviet-British relations, because the Soviet Union has concluded treaties of mutual assistance and alliance with these two countries with the aim of opposing the threat of the revival of German militarism. The Soviet government has pointed out that once the Paris Agreements are ratified, these treaties will become a guise, allowing the French and British governments to actively collude with German militarists against the Soviet Union under the cover of this guise. Since the French and British governments have become allies of West German militarism, they must bear full responsibility for the abolition of these treaties (which is inevitable after the ratification of the Paris Agreements).

    The extremely important task to which Soviet foreign policy is dedicated, both now and in the past, is to consolidate peace and ease international tensions. This is what determines the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Paris military agreements, which pursue aggressive aims.

    Before the Paris Agreements come into effect and are implemented, it is still possible to prevent the development of events, to block the road to war and to stop war preparations. But the longer it is delayed, the more difficult it will be to achieve this goal.

    The Soviet Union has always been the most resolute and consistent opponent of the policy of West German re-militarization. The Soviet Union has always advocated the unification of Germany on a democratic and peaceful basis, and advocated satisfying the national aspirations of the German people. Nothing, no one, can shake the Soviet people's view that the revival of German militarism poses a direct threat to the security, freedom and independence of European countries. The Soviet Union's attitude towards the Paris Agreements is endorsed and supported by peace forces in all countries, because the Paris Agreements permanently divide Germany and exacerbate the threat of a new war. Most of the people in Europe are increasingly aware of the need to launch a movement against the implementation of the Paris Agreements.

    If we soberly assess the facts, it is clear that the forces opposing West German re-militarization are much stronger than the forces in Europe supporting this evil policy. On one side of the scale are the scandalous decisions reluctantly made by the parliaments of various countries through formal votes, opening the way for the ratification of the Paris Agreements; on the other side is the strength and power of the growing mass movement against the implementation of the Paris Agreements and against the aggressive plans for preparing a new war.

    We cannot underestimate the increased danger of a new war due to the ratification of the Paris Agreements. But at the same time, we must not forget that the positions occupied by the aggressive forces, which do not have the support of the people, are unstable, and the united forces of peace and progress are opposing them.

    The people of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies must draw the necessary conclusions from the major changes in the international situation due to the ratification of the Paris Agreements. They will be more concerned about their own security and enhance the strength and power of their countries.

    加紧反对侵略计划的斗争
    ——“真理报”评论巴黎协定的批准的社论摘要
    新华社三日讯　塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”二日发表了题为“加紧反对侵略计划的斗争”的社论，评论巴黎协定的批准。摘要如下：
    巴黎协定的批准使国际局势发生了变化。它允许西德复仇主义者开始建立一支五十万人的骨干部队，并且允许用各种现代化武器来装备这支军队。西德垄断资本已经在把整个西德的经济，包括鲁尔的经济在内，转向军事轨道。在以前，波恩共和国的统治集团和它的美国保护人是没有采取这样明目张胆的行动的可能的，而巴黎协定给了他们这样的可能。这就是说，情况已经有了重大的改变。复活德国军国主义的大门敞开了，新战争的危险日益增加。
    巴黎协定的批准不会不极其严重地影响到苏法和苏英的关系，因为苏联同这两个国家曾经订立了目的在反对复活德国军国主义的威胁的同盟互助条约。苏联政府曾经指出：巴黎协定一旦批准，这些条约就会变成一种幌子，使法国和英国政府可以在这个幌子的掩饰下积极同德国军国主义者串通一气来反对苏联。法国和英国政府既然成了西德军国主义的同盟者，那就要对这些条约的废除（这种废除是巴黎协定批准后所不可避免的）负完全责任。
    苏联外交政策致力解决的极重要任务，无论在现在和过去，都是巩固和平和缓和国际紧张局势。也就是这一点决定了苏联对待追求侵略目的的巴黎军事协定的态度。
    在巴黎协定还没有生效以前，还没有付诸实施以前，还有可能阻止事件的发展，还有可能堵塞战争道路和制止战争准备。但是越往下拖，要达到这个目的也就越加困难。
    苏联一向最坚决一贯地反对西德重新军国主义化的政策。苏联一向主张在民主和平的基础上统一德国，主张满足德国人民的民族愿望。任何人、任何东西都不能动摇苏联人的这种看法：德国军国主义的复活在给欧洲各国的安全、自由和独立造成直接的威胁。苏联对巴黎协定采取的态度得到各国和平力量的赞同和支持，因为巴黎协定使德国永远陷于分裂并且加剧新战争威胁。欧洲的大部分人民日益认识到必须展开反对实现巴黎协定的运动了。
    如果清醒地估计一下事实，那末就很明显，反对西德重新军国主义化的力量，要比在欧洲支持这一罪恶政策的力量强大得多。天平的一端，是各国议会以形式的投票勉强作出的、声名狼藉的、为批准巴黎协定打开道路的决定，另一端是反对实现巴黎协定，反对准备新战争的侵略计划的日益壮大的群众运动的力量和威力。
    不能对由于巴黎协定的批准而使新战争的危险增加这一点估计不足。但同时也不能忘记，得不到人民支持的侵略势力所占的阵地是不稳固的，团结起来的和平和进步力量正在反对它们。
    苏联和人民民主国家的人民要从由于巴黎协定的批准而发生了重大变化的国际局势中作出必要的结论。他们将更加关怀自己的安全，增强自己国家的力量和威力。
