    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 5th: Tokyo dispatch: The US State Department issued a statement on the 3rd by Secretary of State Dulles, stating that the US government is not prepared to hold talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu in Washington recently, on the grounds that Dulles does not have time to meet with Shigemitsu. The Hatoyama government had previously requested to send Shigemitsu to the United States in early April to "explain" Japan's foreign policy toward China and the Soviet Union, and hoped to obtain US consent to reduce Japan's disguised occupation fee burden. After the US refused the talks, Hatoyama announced on the 4th that he would temporarily cancel the plan to send Shigemitsu to the United States, but still stated that it was necessary to send Shigemitsu to the United States as soon as possible.
    The news of Dulles's refusal of the Japanese government's request to send Shigemitsu to the United States has caused great shock in Japan. The Japanese press believes that this has damaged Japan's national self-esteem and pointed out that Dulles's refusal is to put pressure on Japan in order to force Japan not to improve its relations with the countries of the peace and democracy camp. There are also reports that Dulles refused the talks in order to pressure Japan to substantially increase its military budget.

    美国向日本加施压力
    杜勒斯拒绝重光葵访美
    新华社五日讯　东京消息：美国国务院在三日发表国务卿杜勒斯的声明，表示美国政府不准备在最近和日本外务相重光葵在华盛顿举行会谈，理由是杜勒斯没有时间会见重光葵。鸠山政府日前曾要求在四月上旬派重光葵去美国“解释”日本对中国和苏联的外交政策，并且希望取得美国的同意，减轻日本的变相占领费负担。在美国拒绝会谈之后，鸠山已在四日宣布暂时取消派遣重光葵去美国的计划，但仍表示有必要尽可能快地派重光葵去美国。
    杜勒斯拒绝日本政府派重光葵访美的消息在日本激起了很大的震动。日本报界认为这损害了日本的民族自尊，并且指出：杜勒斯的拒绝是对日本施压力，以便迫使日本不要改善它和和平民主阵营国家的关系。还有消息说，杜勒斯拒绝会谈是想压迫日本大量增加军事预算。
