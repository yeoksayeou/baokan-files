Publication of Chinese Translations of "Selected Works of Pollitt" and Others

Chinese translations of "Selected Works of Pollitt" and books introducing British political economy are being published successively.

The first volume of "Selected Works of Pollitt" has recently been released in bookstores. The selected works are divided into four volumes, published by World Knowledge Press. The first volume includes eighteen articles, mainly essays and lectures from 1919 to 1936, discussing trade union struggles, the minority movement, and the establishment of a united front against war and fascism. These essays and lectures allow readers to understand the sharp struggles waged by the progressive forces led by the Communist Party of Great Britain against the reactionary forces during this period. The other volumes of the selected works will also be published successively.

Previously, World Knowledge Press and People's Publishing House have published many books introducing the Communist Party of Great Britain and British politics and economy. These include Pollitt's political report at the 22nd National Congress of the Communist Party of Great Britain, "Arise, Britain!", Pollitt's autobiography "Serving My Time," Gallacher's "Rise Like Lions," Dutt's "Britain and the Crisis of the British Empire," Eaton's "An Analysis of the Economic Problems of Britain," and Gollan's "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of Great Britain," etc.
