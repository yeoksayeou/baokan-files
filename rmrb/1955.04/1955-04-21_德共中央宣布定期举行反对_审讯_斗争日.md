    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 20th: The West German "Free People's Daily" in Dusseldorf published a statement on the 17th issued by the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party. The statement announced that April 23rd and 24th would be designated as days of struggle to oppose the "trial" of the German Communist Party and to protect the legal rights of the German Communist Party, and called on all party members and all patriots to conduct widespread publicity to oppose the "trial" of the German Communist Party.

    The statement said: "By April 23rd, Adenauer's 'trial' against the glorious German Communist Party will enter its sixth month. The purpose of 'trying' the German Communist Party is to slander the German Communist Party in order to drive the German people to participate in preparations for a new war. But Adenauer and the judges of Karlsruhe have miscalculated. Our representatives have been exposing the lies of the slanderers and war instigators in court day after day."

    The statement said: The events of 1933, when the German Communist Party was banned, must not be repeated. The German people must not be dragged into the abyss again. "Every German should know that in Karlsruhe, the issue is war or peace, unification or division, social progress, or militarist reaction. Therefore, use all your strength to defend the party's legal rights! Raise a million-fold protest against the 'trial'!"

    德共中央宣布定期举行反对“审讯”斗争日
    新华社柏林二十日电　西德杜塞尔多夫的“自由人民报”十七日刊载了德国共产党中央委员会书记处发表的声明。声明宣布订四月二十三日和二十四日为反对“审讯”德国共产党、保护德国共产党的合法权利的斗争日，并号召全体党员和一切爱国者进行家喻户晓的宣传，反对“审讯”德国共产党。
    声明说：“到四月二十三日，阿登纳对光荣的德国共产党进行的‘审讯’就要进入第六个月了。‘审讯’德国共产党的目的是污蔑德国共产党，以便驱使德国人民参加新战争的准备。但是，阿登纳和加尔斯卢合法官们打算错了。我们的代表在法庭上一天又一天地揭穿了诽谤者和战争挑拨者的谎话。”
    声明说：绝不允许重演一九三三年取缔德国共产党的事件，绝不允许再把德国人民拖进深渊。“每一个德国人应该知道，在加尔斯卢合，问题是战争或是和平，统一或是分裂，社会进步，或是军国主义的反动。因此，用一切力量来保卫党的合法权利吧！百万倍地掀起反对‘审讯’的抗议吧！”
