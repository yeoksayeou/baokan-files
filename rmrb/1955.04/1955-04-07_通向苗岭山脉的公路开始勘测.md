    The Guizhou Provincial Department of Transportation's Highway Bureau recently dispatched two highway survey teams, totaling more than sixty people, to conduct road route surveys in the Lushan, Leishan, and Taijiang Miao Autonomous Regions, and the Sansui, Jianhe, and Liping counties, where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities or mixed residence. The plan is to build a road in these counties, which are crisscrossed by the Miao Mountain Range, to closely connect these counties with Guiyang City and provide good conditions for ethnic minorities to build mountainous areas.

    The survey work will be carried out separately and is expected to complete the reconnaissance and partial line determination work in 1955.

    通向苗岭山脉的公路开始勘测
    贵州省交通厅公路局最近派出了两个公路勘测队共六十多人，前往少数民族聚居或杂居的炉山、雷山、台江苗族自治区和三穗、剑河、黎平等县进行公路路线勘测工作。计划在这些被苗岭山脉盘亘的县份中修筑一条公路，使这些县紧密地和贵阳市联系起来，给兄弟民族建设山区提供良好条件。
    勘测工作将分头进行，预计一九五五年可完成踏勘和部分线路的定测工作。　（新华社）
