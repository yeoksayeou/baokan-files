    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th - According to TASS, Moscow: "Pravda" and "Izvestia" published editorials on the 10th, commenting on the Soviet Council of Ministers' suggestion to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to abolish the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Franco-Soviet Treaty.

    "Pravda" published an editorial entitled "Necessary Steps," stating that the Soviet measures were caused by recent changes in the policies of Britain and France. Britain and France blatantly disregarded their obligations and signed the Paris Agreements, and the French and British parliaments have ratified these agreements. It is quite obvious that the revival of German militarism has created a new situation in Europe and has transformed Britain and France from allies of the Soviet Union into allies of German militarism.

    The editorial emphasized that the policy of reviving German militarism pursued by the ruling groups of Britain and France is a direct violation of the obligations stipulated in the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Franco-Soviet Treaty. The editorial continued, "Treaties must be observed" is a basic principle of international law. It is absolutely impermissible to allow certain powerful figures to turn international treaties into a smokescreen at will, so that these figures can use this smokescreen to hide from public opinion the true trend of their policies, which in essence run counter to these treaties. Some people in France and Britain are trying to have it both ways: concluding military agreements with West German militarists against the Soviet Union, while at the same time preserving their treaties with the Soviet Union in order to guarantee the security of Britain and France under the threat of a revived Germany.

    The editorial emphasized that the Soviet government has repeatedly called the attention of the British and French governments to the fact that the Anglo-Soviet and Franco-Soviet Treaties are incompatible with the Paris Agreements. The Soviet government has repeatedly warned that these treaties will be cancelled by the ratification of the Paris Agreements, because the ratification of the Paris Agreements will render these treaties useless and meaningless.

    "Izvestia's" editorial said: The British and French governments have recently concentrated all their efforts on getting the Paris Agreements ratified. In doing so, they have shown that they do not cherish the alliance with the Soviet Union in the slightest and have no interest in it. It is only natural that the Soviet government has drawn appropriate conclusions from this attitude of the British and French governments. Concern for the interests of European peace prompts these conclusions, and the Soviet government has consistently taken the interests of European peace as the guiding principle of its actions. The editorial pointed out that the British and French governments want to use the treaties concluded with the Soviet Union to conceal their policy of actively participating in aggressive military blocs together with German militarism. The Soviet Union can never be an accomplice to the British and French governments on such an issue!

    The editorial continued: The initiators of the Paris Agreements have not been able to deceive the masses. The majority of the people in Western European countries oppose these agreements. The fact that the British and French governments are so active in reviving German militarism and preparing for a new war only shows that they are disregarding the national interests of their countries in order to cater to the selfish interests of the aggressive bloc.

    The editorial said that the Soviet Union cannot be indifferent to the ratification of the Paris Agreements, which pursue aggressive aims. The editorial concluded by saying that the Soviet people unanimously support the government's foreign policy of exposing the conspiracies of aggressive forces and encouraging all those who are determined to block the road to war to wage a struggle for peace.

    “真理报”和“消息报”评论苏联部长会议所采取的措施
    苏联废除英苏和法苏条约是必要的步骤
    新华社十日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”和“消息报”十日发表社论，评论苏联部长会议向苏联最高苏维埃主席团建议废除英苏条约和法苏条约问题。
    “真理报”以“必要的步骤”为题发表社论说，苏联的措施是由于英国和法国的政策中近来所发生的变化而引起的。英国和法国公然不顾它们所承担的义务而签署了巴黎协定，法国和英国的议会已经批准了这些协定。十分明显，德国军国主义的复活在欧洲造成了一种新局面，并且使英国和法国从苏联的盟国变为德国军国主义的盟国。
    社论强调指出，英法两国统治集团所奉行的复活德国军国主义的政策是直接违反英苏条约和法苏条约所规定的义务的。社论接着说，“条约必须遵守”是国际法的基本原则。决不允许凭某些有势力人士的意志而把国际条约变成一个烟幕，使这些人物能够用这个烟幕使舆论看不见他们在本质上同这些条约背道而驰的政策的真正趋向。在法国和英国有些人满心想脚踏两只船：同西德军国主义者缔结反对苏联的军事协定，同时保存它们同苏联缔结的条约，以便在复活的德国威胁下保证英国和法国的安全。
    社论强调说，苏联政府曾经不止一次地提请英国和法国政府注意，英苏和法苏条约是和巴黎协定不相容的。苏联政府已经一再警告，这些条约将由巴黎协定的批准而取消，因为批准巴黎协定将使这些条约没有用处和没有意义。
    “消息报”的社论说：英法两国政府最近都集中全力来使巴黎协定获得批准。这样，它们就表明：它们丝毫不珍视同苏联的同盟，对这个同盟没有兴趣。苏联政府从英法两国政府的这一态度中得出了恰当的结论是非常自然的。对于欧洲和平利益的关心促使得出这些结论，苏联政府一直不渝地以欧洲和平利益作为自己行动的指针。社论指出，英法两国政府想利用同苏联缔结的条约掩饰同德国军国主义一道积极参加侵略性的军事集团的政策。苏联在这样一个问题上决不能成为英法两国政府的帮手！
    社论接着指出：巴黎协定的发起者们并没有能迷惑群众。西欧国家的大部分人民反对这些协定。英法两国政府在复活德国军国主义和准备新战争方面表现得很积极，这只是说明它们不顾它们国家的民族利益来迎合侵略集团的自私利益。
    社论说，苏联决不能对于批准奉行侵略目的的巴黎协定漠不关心。社论最后说，苏联人民一致拥护政府所奉行的揭露侵略势力的阴谋和鼓舞所有决心堵塞走向战争的道路的人们进行争取和平的斗争的外交政策。
