    Learning from Czechoslovakian Puppet Art
    Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, Tian Han
    The Czechoslovakian Lipeles Puppet Theater troupe, led by Comrade Ili Filip, performed their wonderful programs in Beijing: the four-act folk fairytale "Golden Hair," adapted by the poet Keinar; the two-act play "Tall Ivan" by the Soviet Breobrazhensky and Obraztsov; the three-act, four-scene fairytale "Little White Ears" by Viltzer; and "The Little House on the Hill" and "Grandpa's Sweet Turnip," performed for young children. These beautiful performances have given us our first lesson in how to improve the art of puppet theater.

    I will now take "Golden Hair" as an example to talk about our feelings.

    The story of "Golden Hair" unfolds as follows: a cruel king threatens a young laborer—his servant and cook, Irzek—with death if he does not find the legendary Golden Hair. Because this young man is usually brave in helping others, even suffering small creatures, he finally, with their help, marries the beautiful Golden Hair from across the distant Danube. The king seizes Golden Hair and kills Irzek. Golden Hair asks the king for one last meeting with Irzek, and she uses the "water of rejuvenation" to revive Irzek, making him even more handsome. The greedy king also wants to make himself handsome, but receives the punishment he deserves.

    This lyrical fairytale prominently demonstrates the virtues of diligence, kindness, and bravery of the working people, and is of great educational significance to child audiences. Although the target audience of puppet theater is not limited to children, and adults also enjoy it, it is mainly for children. We must learn from the spirit of Czechoslovakian puppet theater workers, who wholeheartedly and creatively serve child audiences in this way.

    The modeling of Czechoslovakian puppet art first attracted our interest. The hero Irzek in the play is endowed with a simple and heroic lovable image; the cruel king and another king (Golden Hair's father) are also successfully shaped, and you can recognize different personalities from their same golden crown and crimson robes, and the same deep eyes and high noses. Because most Chinese puppet plays are based on classical dramas, they usually have wide sleeves and are not very concerned with the limbs. Western puppets reflect the customs of Western people, and focus on the hands and chest, so the shaping and expression of the hands are more realistic and natural. Some Chinese puppets have well-shaped faces, but their hands are clenched and turned outwards, appearing very stiff. This is what we must first learn from Czechoslovakian and Western puppet making art. (The hands of Sichuan and Guangdong puppets are also very exquisite; they can even undress, tie belts, take out hairpins, and do needlework, but that is only used for special effects performances; the general hands are not very beautiful, and the proportions are not accurate enough.)

    Golden Hair is the main character that the audience expects, and the shaping of her kind personality is successful, but she could be made beautiful enough to match that handsome young man. The beauty of hair lies not only in its color, but also in its soft and warm feeling; but don't let it be too messy, and don't sprinkle it with gold paper scraps, as that would make it too cold.

    Animals play an important role in fairytales. Czechoslovakian puppet theater workers also put a lot of effort into the modeling of animals. In this play there are puppies, lambs, crows, doves, golden carp, butterflies, and invisible ants. The puppy plays an important role in the play; when Irzek sweeps the floor, the puppy lies on the broom; the lamb butts a sleeping shepherd to wake him up; Golden Hair caresses the flowers and plants in the garden, and doves fly close to her in pairs; these places are very interesting, of course, the flight of the doves can be handled more appropriately. The treatment of flowers and trees is also very good, and the director emphasizes the close relationship between people and nature. When the sentimental Golden Hair leans against the old tree in front of the courtyard, frowning and conceiving, you will feel that the old tree is caring for her.

    The stage setting is also worth learning from. The distant view of the Danube is very pleasing, would it be better if some ripples were added? The scene of Irzek rowing across the river in the sunset is what puppet theater is best at. Irzek rowing the boat close to the edge of the garden to greet Golden Hair, and Golden Hair getting on the boat with Irzek, are all handled very vividly and with affection. This is not easy for other drama types to do.

    Czechoslovakian puppet theater workers treat their artistic labor seriously and meticulously. To give an example: during the performance, the puppets always maintain an accurate horizon, without the problem of our puppets and shadow puppets flying up and down the stage. This is the result of the actors' long-term attention and training under the guidance of the director. The accuracy of the horizon should be said to be a basic condition for realistic performance. People who have seen Chinese puppet shows will feel that Chinese puppets generally move a lot. Czechoslovakian puppet theater workers manipulate puppets very "steadily," paying great attention to the inner characterization of the characters in more detailed movements, while our puppets generally have larger movements and stage activity ranges. Some comrades therefore wonder whether the Stanislavski system can also be applied to puppet show performance? Seriously speaking, since the requirements for stage actors and puppets in expressing life, emotions, and character are the same, of course they can and should accept this progressive and scientific performance system. Those who have understood the backstage situation of the puppet stage know the sincere and selfless artistic efforts of the artists when they express the characters' personalities through the manipulation of the puppets. They put their whole body and mind into the puppets. When they perform well, you can really hear the puppets breathing and their hearts beating. That is precisely the world of Stanislavski.

    Of course, there is also a traditional foundation issue here. Although Czechoslovakian puppet shows also have singing, they seem to be mainly based on spoken drama. Our puppet shadow puppets are almost all closely integrated with local operas. The performance movements of our puppet shadow puppets are organized according to the rhythm of the opera music, and the artists exaggerate them, so they naturally move very vigorously. Exaggerated large movements are originally not contrary to the principles of Stanislavski, but the question is how to make them more appropriate, more purposeful, more based on life, and more able to highlight thoughts and feelings.

    Producing more scripts that are thoughtful, artistic, and can fully express the characteristics of the drama type is a key condition for the development of puppet art. After watching "Golden Hair" and other complete puppet shows, we are very happy. We have not served the vast number of children well enough in the past, or we have simply rarely taken responsibility for tens of millions of young audiences. After seeing the hard work of the Czechoslovakian comrades, we feel infinitely ashamed. I ask all literary and drama workers in the country to make a grand wish to catch up quickly for this weak link.

    向捷克斯洛伐克木偶艺术学习
    中国戏剧家协会主席　田汉
    伊利·斐利皮同志领导的捷克斯洛伐克利培勒兹木偶剧团在北京演出了他们的精采的节目：诗人凯纳尔改编的四幕民间童话剧“金发姑娘”、苏联布列奥布拉任斯基和奥布拉兹卓夫的两幕剧“高大的伊万”、维尔茨尔的三幕四场童话剧“小白耳朵”以及为幼小的儿童们演出的“小山上的房子”和“爷爷播种的甜萝卜”。这些优美的演出，给我们上了如何改进木偶剧艺术的第一课。
    我现在只以“金发姑娘”为例，说一说我们的感受。
    “金发姑娘”的故事是这样发展的：一个残暴的国王用死来威胁一个劳动青年——他的佣人和厨子依尔瑞克去寻找传闻中的金发姑娘。由于这青年平日勇于帮助别人甚至受难的小生物，他终于在它们的帮助之下，从遥远的多瑙河对岸娶回了美丽的金发姑娘。国王夺了金发姑娘，杀死了依尔瑞克。金发姑娘向国王要求再见依尔瑞克一面，她用“回春的水”使依尔瑞克复活，并且更漂亮了。贪心的国王也想使自己变得漂亮，但受到应有的惩罚。
    这个富于抒情味的童话剧，突出地表现了劳动人民勤劳、仁爱、勇敢的美德，对于儿童观众有极大教育意义。木偶剧的服务对象虽不限于儿童，成人也是爱看的，但主要是儿童。我们正是要学习捷克斯洛伐克木偶剧工作者这样全心全意地和创造性地为儿童观众服务的精神。
    捷克斯洛伐克木偶艺术的造型首先吸引了我们的兴趣。剧中的英雄人物依尔瑞克被赋予了纯朴而英挺的可爱形象；残暴的国王和另一国王（金发姑娘的父亲）也塑造得很成功，你从他们同一金冠绛袍，同一深目高鼻中，可以识别出不同的性格。中国木偶剧因多数取材古典剧，通常宽袍大袖，不甚注重肢体。西方木偶反映了西方人民的风习，很着重手部和胸部，因而手的塑造和表情比较写实而自然。中国的木偶有的面目塑造得很好，但是两手捏拳外拐，显得非常僵硬。这是首先要向捷克斯洛伐克和西方木偶制作艺术学习的。（四川、广东木偶的手也有很精的，他们甚至能解衣，结带，取簪，做针线，但那仅用于特技表演，一般的手不甚美，比例也不够准确。）
    金发姑娘是观众期待的主要人物，对于她的善良性格的塑造是成功的，但还可以让她美得足以跟那英俊的青年相配匹。头发的美不仅在它的颜色，而且在它的柔细温馨的感觉；但不要让它太乱，也不要洒上金纸屑，那样便显得太冷了。
    动物在童话剧中占重要地位。捷克斯洛伐克木偶剧工作者们对动物的造型也是很用力的。这剧中有小狗，有小羊，有乌鸦，有白鸽，有金色鲤鱼，有飞蝶，还有看不见的蚂蚁。小狗在剧中起着重要作用，依尔瑞克扫地时，小狗趴在笤帚上面；羊把睡着的牧童一头撞开；金发姑娘在园子里爱抚着花草，白鸽双双飞近她；这些地方都非常有趣，当然像白鸽的飞翔还可以搞得合适一些。对花木的处理也很好，导演者强调了人跟大自然的亲密关系。多愁善感的金发姑娘依靠着庭前的老树颦眉构思的时候，你会感觉到那老树在关心地扶着她。
    舞台装置也值得我们学习。多瑙河的远景很使人欢喜，如果再加些波光是不是更好？依尔瑞克在晚霞中打桨渡江的场景是木偶剧最擅长的。依尔瑞克把小船划近花园边来迎接金发姑娘，和金发姑娘跟依尔瑞克上船的表演，都处理得非常生动而有情致。这是别的剧种不容易办到的。
    捷克斯洛伐克木偶剧工作者们，严肃地、一丝不苟地对待自己的艺术劳动。举一个例来说：在表演进行中，木偶始终保持着准确的地平线，没有我们的木偶剧和皮影上下场飞来飞去的毛病。这是由于演员们在导演的指导下长期注意和训练的结果。地平线的准确性应该说是现实性演出的一个基本的条件。看过中国木偶剧的人，都会感到中国的木偶一般地动得很多。捷克斯洛伐克的木偶剧工作者们操纵木偶非常“稳”，非常注意在较为细致的动作中进行人物内心的刻划，而我们的木偶一般动作和舞台活动范围比较大。有的同志因而想到是否木偶戏表演也能运用斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系？认真说，舞台演员跟木偶在表现生活感情和性格的要求既是一致的，当然也可以和应该接受这一进步的科学的表演体系。了解过木偶舞台的幕后情况的，可知艺人们为了通过木偶的操纵表现人物性格时那一种精诚的忘我的艺术努力，他们把全身心都投入到木偶上面去了，演得好的时候你真会听到木偶在呼吸，心脏在搏动。那正是斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的世界。
    当然，这里也有一个传统基础问题。捷克斯洛伐克的木偶剧虽则也有唱，似乎主要以话剧为基础。我们的木偶皮影差不多一致地跟地方戏曲结合得很紧。我们木偶皮影的表演动作是根据戏曲音乐的节奏组织的，艺人又加以夸张，那自然动得很厉害。夸张的大动作本来也无背于斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的原理的，问题在如何使它更适当，更有目的性，更有生活根据，更能突出思想感情。
    产生更多有思想性和艺术性而又能充分表现剧种特点的剧本，是木偶艺术发展的关键性的条件。看了“金发姑娘”等完整的木偶剧，我们非常欢喜。我们过去为广大儿童服务得不够好，或者说简直很少负起对几千万的幼年观众的责任。看了捷克斯洛伐克同志们的辛勤的努力，使人无限惭愧。我要求全国文学戏剧工作者发下宏愿，来为这一个薄弱的一环而急起直追。
