Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 6th. The testimony of Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Walter Robertson at a closed-door meeting of the House Appropriations Committee on February 10th, which was released on the 5th, blatantly reveals the U.S. government's policy of hostility towards the Chinese people.

Robertson told the committee that he believed the existence of the People's Republic of China was the "greatest threat to the security of the United States..." He strongly advocated that the United States adopt a policy of "military strength" towards China. Robertson also openly stated that the United States should take "actions to promote internal disintegration" on the Chinese mainland, that is, to carry out subversive activities against the Chinese people's regime.

Robertson said that the United States wants to keep Taiwan in its hands. He said that the United States must "aid" the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and that one of the problems facing the United States is "maintaining" the "morale" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's army, which "the U.S. government is paying to train and equip."

In response to questions from members of Congress, Robertson said that the U.S. State Department has no plans to eventually ease tensions and establish more peaceful relations with the People's Republic of China.

    美国助理国务卿罗伯逊的证词表明
    美国政府顽固敌视中国人民
    新华社六日讯　华盛顿消息：五日公布的美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊二月十日在美国众议院拨款委员会秘密会议上的证词，露骨地说明了美国政府敌视中国人民的政策。
    罗伯逊告这个委员会说，他认为中华人民共和国的存在是对“美国安全的……最大威胁”。他力主美国对中国应采取“军事实力”的政策。罗伯逊还公然说，美国要对中国大陆采取“促成内部瓦解的行动”，也就是说，要对中国人民政权进行颠覆活动。
    罗伯逊说，美国要使台湾掌握在它的手中。他说，美国必须“援助”蒋介石卖国集团，美国所面临的问题之一是“维持”“美国政府拿钱训练和装备的”蒋介石卖国集团军队的“士气”。
    罗伯逊在答复众议员提出的问题时说，美国国务院没有目的在最后缓和紧张局势和同中华人民共和国建立比较和平的关系的计划。
