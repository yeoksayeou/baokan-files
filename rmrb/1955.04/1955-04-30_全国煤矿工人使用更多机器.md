　　The degree of mechanization in coal mining in state-owned coal mines nationwide increased by more than 5% in the first quarter of 1955 compared to 1954, while the amount of coal extracted by state-owned coal mines using various machines in 1954 increased 26-fold compared to 1950.
　　Currently, state-owned coal mines nationwide possess nearly 20,000 sets of various coal mining machinery and coal transportation machinery such as combined coal mining machines, coal cutting machines, pneumatic picks, and electric drills. Within this year alone, the Northeast mines will add combined coal mining machines equal to 45% of the existing number in state-owned coal mines nationwide and coal cutting machines equal to 20%.
　　The Soviet government has supplied our country's coal mines with a large number of the latest modern coal mining machines. Soviet experts have also helped our country successfully manufacture 50 types of coal mining machinery that could never be manufactured before liberation, such as combined coal mining machines, coal cutting machines, coal loading machines, and explosion-proof electric motors in the past three years. All machinery used for underground coal mining and underground and above-ground coal transportation can now be manufactured in our country.
　　The technical skills of our country's coal miners in using machinery have also greatly improved. In 1953 and 1954 alone, more than 180,000 ordinary coal mine workers were trained to become skilled combined coal mining machine drivers, coal cutting machine drivers, and other technical workers, some of whom have become engineering and technical personnel.

    全国煤矿工人使用更多机器
    一九五五年第一季度全国国营煤矿的采煤机械化程度比一九五四年提高了百分之五以上，而一九五四年国营煤矿利用各种机械开采出来的煤量，就比一九五零年增长二十六倍。
    目前，全国国营煤矿已拥有联合采煤机、割煤机、风镐和电钻等各种采煤机械和煤炭运输机械近两万台。在今年年内，仅东北各矿还要增加等于全国国营煤矿现有台数百分之四十五的联合采煤机和百分之二十的割煤机。
    苏联政府以大批最新式的现代化采煤机械供应了我国煤矿。苏联专家并在最近的三年内帮助我国制造成功了解放前从来不能制造的联合采煤机、割煤机、装煤机和防爆电动机等煤矿机械五十种。所有井下采煤和井上下运输煤炭用的机械，现在我国都已能自己制造。
    我国煤矿工人使用机械的技术也大大提高。在一九五三年和一九五四年两年内，就有十八万多名普通煤矿职工被培养成为熟练的联合采煤机司机、割煤机司机等各种技术工人，有的并已成为工程技术人员。
