Currently, it is a time when agricultural production cooperatives in various places urgently need production funds, but many cooperatives have encountered a major obstacle in mobilizing members to invest: many middle peasant members are unwilling to invest.

In order to increase production, agricultural production cooperatives need members to invest a portion of production funds into the cooperative according to their economic strength, in addition to the seeds, feed, and fodder that members bring in when they join the cooperative. Generally, middle peasant members have a thicker financial base and more production funds than poor peasants, and their ability to invest after joining the cooperative is much stronger than that of poor peasant members. Therefore, their investment should generally be a little more than that of poor peasants. However, when the cooperative mobilizes members to invest, they describe themselves as poorer than poor peasants and are unwilling to invest more. Some middle peasant members find that the price of their livestock and farm tools when they joined the cooperative is slightly more than the share fund they should contribute, and they demand a refund. Some take the funds that they used for production year-round when they were working individually to buy things that they don't need temporarily and store them, rather than investing in the cooperative. Chao Yongfu (a middle peasant), a member of the Red October Agricultural Production Cooperative in the southern suburbs of Beijing, did not invest in the cooperative but spent 170 yuan to buy materials for three coffins and put them away. Why are middle peasant members unwilling to invest more? The main reason is that they are afraid of losing out by investing more. They believe that "the cooperative belongs to everyone, and investing more benefits others." They say:
	“My land, draft animals, and farm tools are already more than others in the cooperative, and investing more would be too much of a loss.”

Will middle peasant members actually suffer losses by investing more in the cooperative? At first glance, it seems like their own money is being taken out for everyone to use, and others are taking advantage of them. In fact, as long as you do the math, you can see that investing more will not only not cause a loss but will also benefit you. Investment exceeding the share fund is equivalent to members lending money to the cooperative for use. In the future, the cooperative will not only repay the principal but also pay a certain amount of interest. How can this be said to be a loss? Looking a little further ahead: if everyone actively invests and the cooperative has sufficient production funds, it can expand production and increase income. If the entire cooperative increases production, the dividends that members receive will also increase. Middle peasant members have more land, so after the cooperative increases production, the benefits they receive in terms of land dividends will be more than those of poor peasants. At the same time, middle peasant members also work in the cooperative. If the entire cooperative increases production, they can also receive more dividends for the labor portion. In general, investing more is indeed not a loss but is more beneficial. In Gongfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative, Chongyi Township, Wu'an County, Hebei Province, there was a member named Jin Qizhu, an old middle peasant. Before joining the cooperative last winter, his family of three cultivated nineteen mu of land, sold two hundred jin of surplus grain, and also sold more than 300 yuan of cotton. After joining the cooperative, when the cooperative mobilized members to invest, he said he had no money. The cooperative committee understood his thinking and sent someone to calculate his income: from last winter when he joined the cooperative to March of this year, he had already accumulated fifty-four workdays. If he continues to work so actively, he can earn at least 180 workdays by autumn; his land in the cooperative is equivalent to 21 standard mu. If he invests more funds in the cooperative now and the entire cooperative increases production, even if each workday is divided by an extra 10 cents and each standard mu is divided by an extra 50 cents, he can get an extra 28.5 yuan. After this careful calculation, he smiled and said, "I understand, anyway, if there is water in the big river, the small canals will not run dry." He invested 100 yuan in the cooperative, becoming the member with the most investment in the entire cooperative.

Agricultural production cooperatives belong to everyone, and whether the cooperative is run well or not is closely related to every member. Every member should cherish the cooperative, care about the cooperative, and run the cooperative well. If the cooperative has difficulties, everyone should overcome them together. Now that the cooperative lacks production funds, members with more surplus money should lend a little more. This is also a responsibility that members should fulfill to the cooperative. Poor peasant members invest less, but they cannot be considered to be taking advantage of the middle peasants, because even with funds, all members must work hard to increase land production. Poor peasants generally contribute more labor to the cooperative than middle peasants, and their role in the cooperative's increased production is significant. Therefore, after the entire cooperative increases production, their income will also increase. It is precisely because of the organization of agricultural production cooperatives that the role of the means of production and labor is better utilized, and everyone can increase their income. Agricultural production cooperatives operate according to the principle of mutual benefit and will not allow some members to suffer losses while others take advantage.

Middle peasant members should dispel their concerns that investing more will cause losses and actively invest in the cooperative, turning dead money into live money, and laying the foundation for the entire cooperative to expand production and complete this year's production plan.

    中农在社里多投资会不会吃亏
    苏农
    目前正是各地农业生产合作社迫切需要生产资金的时候，可是有不少社在发动社员投资的工作中遇到了一个很大的障碍：许多中农社员不愿意投资。
    农业生产合作社为了增加生产，除了社员在入社时带来的一些种子、饲料、饲草等以外，还需要社员根据自己的经济力量向社里投入一部分生产资金。一般中农社员家底子都比较厚，生产资金比贫农充足，他们入社后的投资能力比贫农社员强得多，因此他们的投资一般地应该比贫农多一点；可是在社里发动社员投资时，他们却把自己说得比贫农还穷，不肯多投资。有的中农社员入社牲口农具的折价比应摊的股份基金稍为多了一点，就要求退回；有的把单干时常年用于生产上的资金，拿去买些暂时用不着的东西放着，而不愿意往社里投资。北京市郊南苑区红十月农业生产合作社社员超永富（中农），不向社里投资，却花一百七十元买了三口棺材料子放起来。中农社员为什么不愿意多投资呢？主要原因是他们怕多投了要吃亏。他们以为“社是大家的，自己多投资是便宜了别人”，他们说：
  “我的土地、耕畜、农具入社已经比别人多，再多投资就太吃亏了。”
    中农社员向社里多投资，究竟吃亏不吃亏呢？光从眼前看，好像是自己的钱拿出来大家用，人家就沾了自己的光了。其实，只要算一下账，就可看到多投资不但不会吃亏，而且还对自己有利。超过股份基金的投资，等于社员把钱借给社里用，以后社里除了还本，还要给一定的利息，这怎能说是吃亏了呢？稍往远一点看：如果大家都积极投资，社里的生产资金充足了，就可以扩大生产，增加收入。全社增产了，社员分红也会增多。中农社员土地比较多，社里增产后，中农在土地分红方面得到的利益就会比贫农多；同时，中农社员也在社里劳动，全社增产了，劳力部分也可以多分红。总的说来，多投资的确不是吃了亏而是更有利。河北省武安县崇义乡公丰农业生产合作社有个社员叫靳起柱，是个老中农。去年冬天入社前，他全家三口人，种十九亩地，卖了二百斤余粮，还卖了三百多元的棉花，入社后，社里动员社员投资时，他却说没有钱。社务委员会摸透了他的心思，派人去给他算了一笔账：他从去冬入社到今年三月，已经记了五十四个劳动日，若是像这样积极劳动，到秋后最少可得一百八十个劳动日；他入社的土地折合二十一个标准亩。如果现在多投些资金到社里，全社增产了，就算一个劳动日多分一角钱，一个标准亩多分五角钱，他就可以多分得二十八元五角。经过这一细算，他笑着说：“我算明白了，反正大河里有水小渠不干。”他向社里投资一百元，成了全社投资最多的了。
    农业生产合作社是大家的，社办得好不好和每个社员都有密切的关系。每个社员都应该爱护社，关心社，把社办好。社里有困难，应该大家共同来克服。现在社里缺生产资金，余钱较多的社员多借出一点，也是社员对社应尽的责任，贫农社员投资较少，也不能认为他们就是沾了中农的光，因为有了资金，还必须全体社员努力劳动，才能使土地增产。贫农投在社里的劳动一般要比中农多些，他们对社的增产所起的作用是很大的。因此，全社增产后，他们的收入也会增加。正是由于组织了农业生产合作社，更好地发挥了生产资料和劳力的作用，大家才都能增加收入。农业生产合作社是按照互利的原则来办事的，不会让一部分社员吃亏，另一部分社员占便宜。
    中农社员应当打消怕多投资会吃亏的顾虑，积极向社里投资，把死钱变活钱，为全社扩大生产，完成今年的生产计划打下基础。
