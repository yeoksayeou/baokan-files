    Shaanxi Province is piloting a zoned and classified agricultural technology guidance program. In this program, the province is divided into seven agricultural zones based on factors such as climate, soil, crop types, and farmers' farming habits: the Great Wall border area, the northern Shaanxi hilly area, the Weibei plateau, the Guanzhong plain, the Qinling mountainous area, the Hanzhong basin, and the Bashan mountainous area. Each agricultural zone has key measures suitable for local conditions to increase production. For example, the Great Wall border area, which includes six counties such as Yulin and Hengshan, is characterized by vast land and sparse population, extensive cultivation, proximity to the desert, scarce trees, and frequent wind and sandstorms, resulting in very unstable crop yields. Therefore, in addition to planned construction of village-protecting, field-protecting, and windbreak forest belts in this area, soil and water conservation work must be carried out to prevent disasters and protect seedlings. At the same time, cultivation techniques should be improved by reducing the sowing of "hard-shelled" seeds, implementing rational close planting and uniform seedling distribution, and increasing fertilizer application to increase crop yields. The Guanzhong Plain, which is rich in wheat and cotton, has favorable conditions such as flat terrain, a mild climate, meticulous cultivation techniques, and high and stable yields. Efforts will be made to strengthen deep plowing and land preparation, promote strip planting, implement rational close planting, popularize improved varieties of wheat and cotton, and improve irrigation methods to further increase the yields of wheat and cotton on the existing basis.
    The process of formulating the Shaanxi Province Zoned and Classified Agricultural Technology Guidance Program was as follows: the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry first put forward a draft based on summarizing the experience of applying agricultural technology in recent years. After full discussion at the provincial agricultural technology extension station conference, it was then sent to the leading organs and relevant units of various special districts and counties to solicit opinions. Finally, it was repeatedly revised based on the opinions received and formally became the program. At present, six counties, including Fugu in the Great Wall border area, Xingping in the Guanzhong Plain, and Zhen'an in the Qinling mountainous area, have formulated specific technical guidance programs based on this program and combined with local conditions, and have begun to implement them. The agricultural and forestry departments of counties such as Yulin and Hengshan are surveying forest land and transporting tree seedlings. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties of the Guanzhong Plain have supplied farmers with millions of catties of improved cotton varieties such as "517" and Jingsi cotton, and have begun to transport in a large number of new-style animal-powered farm implements in preparation for promotion. In addition, more than 140 agricultural technology extension stations distributed throughout the province are also guiding farmers to promote rational close planting and increased fertilizer application.

    陕西试行分区分类农业技术指导方案
    陕西省正在试行分区分类农业技术指导方案。在这个方案中，按照气候、土壤、作物种类和农民耕作习惯等条件，把全省分为长城沿线、陕北丘陵、渭北高原、关中平原、秦岭山区、汉中盆地和巴山山区七个农业区域。各农业区域都有适合当地条件的主要增产措施。如包括榆林、横山等六县的长城沿线地区是地广人稀，耕作粗放，加上接近沙漠，树木稀少，时常遭受风沙袭击，农作物产量很不稳定。因此，这个区域除有计划地营造护村、护田林和防风林带外，要进行水土保持工作，以防灾保苗；同时从减少硬花播种、合理密植匀苗、增施肥料等方面改进耕作技术，以提高农作物的收获量。盛产麦、棉的关中平原，由于地势平坦，气候温和，耕作技术细致和产量高而稳定等良好条件，将从加强深耕整地、推行条播、合理密植以及普及小麦、棉花良种、改进灌溉方法等方面着手，使小麦、棉花的产量在现有基础上继续提高。
    陕西省分区分类农业技术指导方案制定的过程是：省农林厅在总结几年来运用农业技术的经验的基础上先提出草案，经过全省农业技术推广站会议的充分讨论，再发到各专区、各县领导机关和有关单位征询意见，最后根据所提意见反复进行修改，正式成为方案。目前长城沿线地区的府谷、关中平原的兴平以及秦岭山区的镇安等六县，已根据这一方案，结合当地具体情况，订出具体的技术指导方案，并已开始执行。榆林、横山等县的农、林部门正在勘察林地和挖运树苗。关中平原各县供销合作社已把几百万斤“五一七”和泾斯棉等棉花良种供应给农民，并开始运到大量新式畜力农具，准备推广。此外，分布在全省各地的一百四十多个农业技术推广站，也都在指导农民推行合理密植、增施肥料等。　　　　　（新华社）
