The Asian-African Conference, convened at the invitation of the Prime Ministers of Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan, was held in Bandung from April 18 to 24, 1955. In addition to the five initiating countries, the following twenty-four countries participated in the conference: 1. Afghanistan, 2. Cambodia, 3. People's Republic of China, 4. Egypt, 5. Ethiopia, 6. Gold Coast, 7. Iran, 8. Iraq, 9. Japan, 10. Jordan, 11. Laos, 12. Lebanon, 13. Liberia, 14. Libya, 15. Nepal, 16. Philippines, 17. Saudi Arabia, 18. Sudan, 19. Syria, 20. Thailand, 21. Turkey, 22. Democratic Republic of Vietnam, 23. State of Vietnam, 24. Yemen.

The Asian-African Conference considered matters of common interest and concern to the countries of Asia and Africa, and discussed means whereby their peoples could achieve fuller economic, cultural, and political cooperation.

A. Economic Cooperation

    1. The Asian-African Conference recognized the urgency of promoting economic development in the Asian-African region. The participating countries generally expressed the hope for economic cooperation based on mutual benefit and mutual respect for national sovereignty. The recommendations regarding economic cooperation among participating countries do not exclude the suitability of cooperation with countries outside the region, including foreign investment, nor the necessity of such cooperation. It was further recognized that assistance obtained by some participating countries from outside the region through international or bilateral arrangements has made valuable contributions to the implementation of their development plans.

    2. The participating countries agreed to provide each other with technical assistance to the greatest extent practically feasible, in the form of: experts, trained personnel, experimental plans and equipment for demonstration, exchange of technical knowledge, establishment of national and—where possible—regional training and research institutions, in cooperation with existing international organizations, in order to teach technical knowledge and skills.

    3. The Asian-African Conference recommended: the early establishment of a United Nations special economic development fund; the allocation of a larger proportion of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development's resources to Asian-African countries; the early establishment of the International Finance Corporation, whose activities should include making fair investments; encouraging the promotion of joint ventures between Asian-African countries, if doing so promotes their common interests.

    4. The Asian-African Conference recognized the significant need to stabilize commodity trade in the region. The Conference accepted the principle of expanding the scope of multilateral trade and payments. However, the Conference recognized that some countries, in view of their current economic situation, will have to adopt bilateral trade arrangements.

    5. The Asian-African Conference recommended: that the participating countries take collective action, through bilateral and multilateral arrangements, to stabilize the international prices of raw materials and necessities; and recommended that they adopt a consistent attitude on this issue within the United Nations Interim Coordinating Committee for International Commodity Arrangements and other international organizations, to the extent practically feasible and appropriate.

    6. The Asian-African Conference also recommended: that Asian-African countries, whenever economically feasible, process their raw materials before export to diversify their export trade; hold trade fairs within the region, and encourage the exchange of trade missions and business groups; encourage the exchange of information and samples to promote trade within the region; and provide normal facilities for the transit trade of landlocked countries.

    7. The Asian-African Conference attached great importance to shipping and expressed concern over the fact that shipping companies frequently revise their freight rates, often to the detriment of the participating countries. The Conference recommended that this issue be studied, followed by collective action to persuade shipping companies to adopt a more reasonable attitude. The Conference believed that the rail freight transport of transit trade could be studied.

    8. The Asian-African Conference unanimously agreed that the establishment of national and regional banks and insurance companies should be encouraged.

    9. The Asian-African Conference believed that exchanging information on oil-related issues such as profit remittance and taxation could ultimately lead to the formulation of common policies.

    10. The Asian-African Conference emphasized that the development of peaceful uses of nuclear energy is of particular significance to Asian-African countries. The Conference: welcomed the initiative of major relevant countries to express their willingness to provide information on the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes; called for the rapid establishment of an International Atomic Energy Agency, which should stipulate full representation of Asian-African countries in the agency's executive bodies; and recommended that Asian-African governments fully utilize the training and other facilities offered by countries initiating such programs in the peaceful utilization of atomic energy.

    11. The Asian-African Conference unanimously agreed to designate liaison officers among the participating countries, nominated by their respective governments, to exchange information and opinions on issues of common interest. The Conference recommended fuller use of existing international organizations and recommended that participating countries which are not members of such international organizations but are eligible for membership obtain membership.

    12. The Asian-African Conference recommended that participating countries consult in advance at international conferences in order to promote their common economic interests as much as possible. However, this is not intended to establish a regional bloc.

B. Cultural Cooperation

    1. The Asian-African Conference firmly believed that the development of cultural cooperation is one of the most powerful tools for promoting understanding between countries. Asia and Africa are the cradles of great religions and civilizations, which have enriched the cultures and civilizations of others while themselves being enriched in the process. Therefore, the cultures of Asia and Africa are built on spiritual and universal foundations. Unfortunately, cultural contacts between Asian and African countries have been interrupted in the past centuries. The peoples of Asian and African countries now share a fervent and sincere desire to restore their old cultural contacts and develop new ones within the scope of the modern world. The governments of the participating countries reaffirmed their determination to work for closer cultural cooperation.

    2. The Asian-African Conference noted that the presence of colonialism in many regions of Asia and Africa, in whatever form it takes, not only hinders cultural cooperation but also suppresses the national cultures of the people. Some colonial countries, by refusing to grant their dependent peoples basic rights in education and culture, hinder the development of their individuality and prevent their cultural exchange with the peoples of other Asian and African countries. This is especially the case in Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco, where the basic rights of the people to study their own languages and cultures have been suppressed. Similar discrimination has also been practiced against Africans and people of color in certain regions of Africa. The Conference considered that these policies amount to a denial of basic human rights, that these policies impede cultural progress in the region, and that they hinder cultural cooperation on a wider international scale. The Conference condemned the denial of basic rights in education and culture in certain regions of Asia and Africa through such or other measures of cultural suppression. The Conference particularly condemned racism, considering it a tool of cultural suppression.

    3. In viewing the development of cultural cooperation between Asian and African countries, the Conference did not harbor any notions of exclusiveness or hostility towards other groups of countries or other civilizations and cultures. The Conference, loyal to the long-standing traditions of tolerance and world unity, believed that Asian-African cultural cooperation should be developed within the larger scope of world cooperation.
    While developing Asian-African cultural cooperation, Asian and African countries hope to develop cultural contacts with other countries. This will enrich their own cultures and will also help to promote world peace and understanding.

    4. Many Asian and African countries are not yet able to develop their own educational, scientific, and technological institutions. The Conference recommended that Asian and African countries that are more fortunate in this regard provide facilities for accepting students and trainees from such countries into their institutions. Such facilities should also be provided to Asians and Africans residing in Africa who currently do not have access to higher education opportunities.

    5. The Asian-African Conference believed that efforts to promote cultural cooperation between Asian and African countries should lead to:

        (1) Achieving an understanding of each other's countries;
        (2) Cultural exchange with each other;
        (3) Exchange of information.

    6. The Asian-African Conference believed that at the present stage, conducting bilateral arrangements to implement the Conference's recommendations and each country taking action on its own whenever possible and feasible would achieve the best results in cultural cooperation.

C. Human Rights and Self-determination

    1. The Asian-African Conference declared its full support for the fundamental principles of human rights set forth in the United Nations Charter and noted that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a common standard of accomplishment for all peoples and all nations.

    The Conference declared its full support for the principles of self-determination of peoples and nations set forth in the United Nations Charter and noted the United Nations resolutions on the right to self-determination of peoples and nations—a prerequisite for the full enjoyment of all basic human rights.

    2. The Asian-African Conference regretted the policies and practices of apartheid and discrimination that have become the basis for the relationship between governments and people in vast regions of Africa and other parts of the world. Such behavior is not only a gross violation of human rights but also a denial of the basic values of civilization and human dignity.

    The Conference warmly sympathized with and supported the courageous attitude adopted by the victims of racial discrimination, especially the people of Indian and Pakistani descent in Africa and South Africa; praised all those who adhere to their cause; reaffirmed the determination of the peoples of Asian and African countries to eradicate all traces of racism that may exist in their own countries; and pledged to use its full moral influence to guard against the danger of committing the same evils in the struggle to eradicate this evil.

D. Problems of Dependent Peoples

    1. The Asian-African Conference discussed the problems of dependent peoples and colonialism and the evils arising from the subjugation, domination, and exploitation of peoples by foreign powers.
    The Conference reached agreement to:

        (1) Declare that colonialism in all its manifestations is an evil which should be speedily brought to an end;

        (2) Affirm that the subjection, domination and exploitation of peoples by foreign powers is a denial of fundamental human rights, is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and is an impediment to the promotion of world peace and cooperation;

        (3) Declare its support for the cause of freedom and independence for all such peoples; and:

        (4) Call upon the powers concerned to grant freedom and independence to such peoples.

    2. In view of the unstable situation in North Africa, and in view of the persistent refusal to grant the peoples of North African countries their rights to self-determination, the Asian-African Conference declared its support for the rights of self-determination and independence of the peoples of Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, and called upon the French government to facilitate a peaceful resolution of this issue without delay.

E. Other Issues

    1. In view of the existing tensions in the Middle East caused by the situation in Palestine and the danger of such tensions to world peace, the Asian-African Conference declared its support for the rights of the Arab people of Palestine and called for the implementation of the United Nations resolutions on Palestine and the achievement of a peaceful resolution of the Palestine issue.

    2. Within the scope of its attitude towards the abolition of colonialism, the Asian-African Conference supported Indonesia's attitude on the West Irian issue in accordance with the relevant agreements between Indonesia and the Netherlands.
    The Asian-African Conference called on the Dutch government to resume negotiations as early as possible to fulfill its obligations under the above-mentioned agreements; and expressed its ardent hope that the United Nations will assist the parties concerned in seeking a peaceful resolution to this dispute.

    3. The Asian-African Conference supported Yemen's position on the issue of Aden and the southern regions of Yemen known as the Protectorate, and called for the parties concerned to reach a peaceful resolution to this dispute.

F. Promoting World Peace and Cooperation

    1. The Asian-African Conference noted the fact that several countries have still not been admitted into the United Nations, and believed that in order to conduct effective cooperation to promote world peace, membership of the United Nations should be universal, and requested the Security Council to support the admission of all countries that meet the conditions for membership under the Charter. The Asian-African Conference believed that the following countries participating in the conference meet such conditions, namely: Cambodia, Ceylon, Japan, Jordan, Laos, Libya, Nepal, a unified Vietnam.

    The Conference believed that the representation of Asian-African countries in the Security Council is inadequate according to the principle of fair geographical distribution. The Conference believed that with regard to the allocation of non-permanent council seats, Asian-African countries that are ineligible for election under the arrangements reached in London in 1946 should be able to participate in the Security Council so that they may make a more effective contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security.

    2. The Asian-African Conference considered the dangerous situation of current international tensions and the danger of a world war breaking out facing all of humanity—in which the destructive power of all kinds of armaments, including nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, would be used—and hereby urged all countries to pay attention to the terrible consequences that would result from the outbreak of such a war.

    The Conference believed that disarmament and the prohibition of the production, testing, and use of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons of war are necessary to save humanity and civilization from the fear and prospect of mass destruction.

    It believed that the Asian-African countries gathered here have a responsibility, for the sake of humanity and civilization, to declare their support for disarmament and the prohibition of these weapons and to call on the major relevant countries and world public opinion to promote disarmament and the prohibition of these weapons.

    The Conference believed that effective international supervision should be established and maintained to implement disarmament and the prohibition of these weapons, and that rapid and determined efforts should be made to achieve this goal.

    Pending the complete prohibition of the manufacture of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, this Conference called on all relevant countries to reach an agreement to cease testing such weapons.

G. Declaration on the Promotion of
      World Peace and Cooperation

    The Asian-African Conference viewed the problems of world peace and cooperation with anxiety. The Conference expressed deep concern about the current international tensions, which carry the danger of a potential atomic world war. The issue of peace is interconnected with the issue of international security. In this regard, all countries should cooperate, especially through the United Nations, to promote disarmament under effective international supervision and the elimination of nuclear weapons. In this way, international peace can be promoted, and nuclear energy can be used entirely for peaceful purposes. This will help meet the needs of Asia and Africa in particular, as they urgently require social progress and improved living standards under greater freedom.

    Freedom and peace are interdependent, the right to self-determination must be enjoyed by the peoples of all countries, and freedom and independence must be granted as soon as possible to those who are still dependent peoples. Indeed, all countries should have the right to freely choose their own political and economic systems and their own way of life in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.

    Countries should exercise tolerance, treat each other with trust and goodwill in an atmosphere of eliminating distrust and fear, live together peacefully as good neighbors, and develop friendly cooperation on the basis of the following principles:

    1. Respect for fundamental human rights, respect for the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.
    2. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries.
    3. Recognition of the equality of all races, recognition of the equality of all nations, large and small.
    4. Non-interference or intervention in the internal affairs of other countries.
    5. Respect for the right of each country to defend itself, individually or collectively, in accordance with the United Nations Charter.
    6. (a) Not using arrangements for collective defense to serve the particular interests of any one of the big powers;
        (b) No country should exert pressure on other countries.
    7. Refraining from acts or threats of aggression, or the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any country.
    8. Settlement of all international disputes by peaceful means, such as negotiation, mediation, arbitration or judicial settlement, as well as any other peaceful means chosen by the parties concerned, in accordance with the United Nations Charter.
    9. Promotion of mutual interests and cooperation.
    10. Respect for justice and international obligations.

    The Asian-African Conference declared its conviction that friendly cooperation in accordance with these principles will make an effective contribution to maintaining and promoting international peace and security, and that cooperation in the economic, social, and cultural fields will help promote the common prosperity and welfare of all.

    The Asian-African Conference recommended that the five initiating countries, in consultation with the participating countries, consider the issue of convening the next session of the Asian-African Conference.

            Bandung, April 24, 1955.

专栏：

    亚非会议联合公报
    在缅甸、锡兰、印度、印度尼西亚和巴基斯坦总理邀请下召开的亚非会议于一九五五年四月十八日至二十四日在万隆举行了会议。除了五个发起国之外，参加会议的有下列二十四个国家：一、阿富汗，二、柬埔寨，三、中华人民共和国，四、埃及，五、埃塞俄比亚，六、黄金海岸，七、伊朗，八、伊拉克，九、日本，十、约旦，十一、老挝，十二、黎巴嫩，十三、利比里亚，十四、利比亚，十五、尼泊尔，十六、菲律宾，十七、沙特阿拉伯，十八、苏丹，十九、叙利亚，二十、泰国，二十一、土耳其，二十二、越南民主共和国，二十三、越南国，二十四、也门。
    亚非会议考虑了亚洲和非洲国家有共同利害关系和共同关心的问题，并且讨论了它们各国人民可以用来实现更充分的经济、文化和政治合作的办法。
    甲、经济合作
    一、亚非会议认识到促进亚非区域的经济发展的迫切性。与会国普遍希望在互利和互相尊重国家主权的基础上实行经济合作。关于与会国中间的经济合作的建议，既不排除包括外国投资在内的同这个区域以外的国家的合作的适宜性，也不排除这种合作的必要性。此外还认识到，某些与会国通过国际安排或双边安排，从这个区域以外获得的援助，对实行它们的发展计划作出了有价值的贡献。
    二、与会国同意在实际可行的最大程度上互相提供技术援助，方式是：专家，受训练人员，供示范用的试验性计划和装备，交换技术知识，在现有的国际机构的合作下，设立一国的和——在可能的情况下——区域性的训练和研究机构，以便教授技术知识和技能。
    三、亚非会议建议：早日设立一项联合国特别经济发展基金；由国际复兴开发银行拨出更大一部分的资力给亚非国家；早日设立国际金融公司，其活动应当包括进行公平的投资；鼓励促进亚非国家之间的联合企业，如果这样做能促进它们的共同利益的话。
    四、亚非会议认识到稳定本区域商品贸易的重大必要性。会议接受了扩大多边贸易和支付的范围的原则。但是会议认识到，有些国家鉴于它们目前的经济情况，将必须采用双边贸易安排。
    五、亚非会议建议：与会国采取集体行动，通过双边安排和多边安排来稳定原始商品的国际价格和需要；并建议它们在切实可行和适当的范围内，在联合国国际商品贸易常设顾问委员会和其他国际机构中对这个问题采取一致的态度。
    六、亚非会议并建议：亚非国家不论什么时候只要在经济上可行就在出口前把它们的原料加工，以便使它们的出口贸易具有多样性；举办区域内的贸易博览会，并鼓励互派贸易代表团和商人团体；鼓励交换情报和样品，以促进区域内的贸易；并为内陆国家的过境贸易提供正常的便利。
    七、亚非会议非常重视航运，并且对航运公司时时在常常是有损于与会国的情况下修订它们的运费率表示关怀。会议建议对这个问题进行研究，随后采取集体行动劝导航运公司采取一种较为合理的态度。会议认为，可以对过境贸易的铁路货运进行研究。
    八、亚非会议一致认为，应该鼓励建立一国的和区域的银行和保险公司。
    九、亚非会议认为，在类如利润的汇兑和税收等有关石油的问题上交换情报，最后可能导向订出共同的政策。
    十、亚非会议强调指出，发展核子能的和平用途对亚非国家特别有意义。会议：欢迎主要有关国家表示愿意提供有关把原子能用于和平目的的情报的倡议；要求迅速成立国际原子能机构，这个机构应当规定亚非国家在这个机构的执行机关中的充分代表权；并建议亚非国家政府在原子能的和平利用方面充分利用发起这种计划的国家所提供的训练方面和其他方面的便利。
    十一、亚非会议一致同意在与会国中指派联络官，其人选由他们各自本国的政府推荐，以便就有共同利害关系的问题交换情报和意见。会议建议更充分地利用现有的国际组织，并建议凡不是这种国际组织的成员但是有资格作为成员的与会国取得成员资格。
    十二、亚非会议建议与会国在国际会议中事先进行磋商，以便尽可能促进它们共同的经济利益。但是这并不是要成立一个区域性集团。
    乙、文化合作
    一、亚非会议深信，发展文化合作是促进各国之间的谅解的最有力的工具之一。亚洲和非洲是伟大宗教和文明的摇篮，这种宗教和文明丰富了他人的文化和文明，同时自己也在这个过程中得到丰富。因此，亚洲和非洲的文化是建立在精神的和世界性的基础上的。不幸，在过去若干世纪中，亚洲和非洲国家之间的文化接触中断了。亚非各国人民现在都怀着一种在现代世界的范围内恢复他们旧有的文化接触和发展新的文化接触的热诚真挚的愿望。各与会国政府重申它们要为更密切的文化合作而努力的决心。
    二、亚非会议注意到：殖民主义在亚洲和非洲许多地区的存在，无论它采取什么形式，都不仅妨碍文化合作，而且压制人民的民族文化。某些殖民国家拒绝给予它们的附属国人民以教育和文化方面的基本权利，从而妨碍他们的个性的发展，并且阻止他们同亚洲和非洲其他国家人民的文化交流。突尼斯、阿尔及利亚和摩洛哥的情况尤其是这样，在那里，人民研究他们自己的语文和文化的基本权利受到了压制。对非洲某些地区的非洲人和有色人民也一直在实行着类似的歧视。会议认为：这些政策等于否定基本人权，这些政策妨碍本地区的文化进步，并阻碍更广泛的国际范围内的文化合作。会议谴责在亚洲和非洲某些地区以这种或别种文化压制的措施来这样否定教育和文化方面的基本权利的现象。会议特别谴责种族主义，认为这是一种压制文化的工具。
    三、会议在看待亚洲和非洲国家之间的文化合作的发展时，不是抱着任何排外或者同其他国家集团以及其他文明和文化相敌对的观念。会议忠于宽容和世界一体的悠久传统，认为亚洲和非洲的文化合作应当在更大的世界合作的范围内发展。
    亚洲和非洲国家希望在发展亚非文化合作的同时，同其他国家发展文化接触。这会丰富它们自己的文化，并且还会有助于促进世界和平和谅解。
    四、亚洲和非洲有许多国家现在还没有能够发展它们自己的教育、科学和技术机构。会议建议亚洲和非洲的在这方面处境比较幸运的国家在接受上述这种国家的学生和受训人员进入它们机构方面给予便利。这种便利也应当提供给目前得不到受高等教育的机会的居住在非洲的亚洲人和非洲人。
    五、亚非会议认为，促进亚非国家文化合作的努力应当导向：
    （一）取得对彼此国家的了解；
    （二）彼此文化交流；
    （三）交换情报。
    六、亚非会议认为，在目前阶段，进行双边安排来实施会议的建议和每一国家只要可能和可行就自行采取行动，就会在文化合作方面取得最好的结果。
    丙、人权和自决
    一、亚非会议宣布它完全支持联合国宪章中所提出的人权的基本原则，并且注意到世界人权宣言是所有人民和所有国家要取得的成就的共同标准。
    会议宣布它完全支持联合国宪章中所提出的各国人民和各个国家自决的原则，并注意到联合国关于各国人民和各个国家自决——这是充分享受一切基本人权的一项先决条件——的权利的各项决议。
    二、亚非会议对于成为非洲广大区域和世界其他地方的政府和人的关系的基础的种族隔离和歧视的政策和实践感到遗憾。这种行为不仅是对人权的粗暴的侵犯，而且是对文明的基本价值和人类尊严的否认。
    会议热烈同情和支持种族歧视的受害者，特别是非洲和南非境内印度和巴基斯坦血统的人民所采取的勇敢态度；赞扬所有坚持他们的事业的人们；重申亚非各国人民决心根除可能存在于他们本国的种族主义的一切痕迹；保证运用它的全部道义影响，谨防在进行根除这一邪恶的斗争时也犯同样邪恶的危险。
      丁、附属国人民问题
    一、亚非会议讨论了附属国人民和殖民主义问题和由于人民受到外国的征服、统治和剥削而产生的邪恶。
    会议取得协议：
    （子）宣布各种各样表现形式的殖民主义是一种应当迅速予以根除的邪恶；
    （丑）确认各国人民受到外国的征服、统治和剥削是对基本人权的否定，是违反联合国宪章的，是对于促进世界和平和合作的一种障碍；
    （寅）宣布会议支持所有这种人民的自由和独立的事业，并：
      （卯）要求有关国家给予这种人民以自由和独立。
    二、鉴于北非不安定的局面，鉴于坚持拒绝给予北非各国人民以它们的自决权利，亚非会议宣布支持阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥和突尼斯人民的自决和独立权利，并要求法国政府毫不拖延地促成这一问题的和平解决。
      戊、其他问题
    一、鉴于由巴勒斯坦局势所引起的中东现存的紧张局势和这种紧张局势对世界和平的危险，亚非会议宣布它支持巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人民的权利，并且要求贯彻联合国关于巴勒斯坦的决议和取得巴勒斯坦问题的和平解决。
    二、亚非会议在它对废除殖民主义所表明的态度的范围内，支持印度尼西亚在西伊里安问题上根据印度尼西亚和荷兰的有关协定而采取的态度。
    亚非会议要求荷兰政府尽早恢复谈判，以履行它依据上述协定而承担的义务；并表示热切希望联合国将协助有关方面设法和平解决这一争端。
    三、亚非会议支持也门在亚丁和被称为保护国的也门南部地区问题上的立场，并要求有关方面获致这一争端的和平解决。
    己、促进世界和平和合作
    一、亚非会议注意到好几个国家仍然没有被接纳进入联合国这一事实，认为为了进行有效的合作以促进世界和平起见，联合国的会员资格应当具有世界性，要求安全理事会支持接纳所有按照宪章具备会员国条件的国家。亚非会议认为，参加会议的下列国家具备这样的条件，即：柬埔寨、锡兰、日本、约旦、老挝、利比亚、尼泊尔、一个统一的越南。
    会议认为，根据公平的地理分配的原则，亚非地区国家在安全理事会中的代表权是不充分的。会议认为，关于非常任理事席位的分配，应该使根据一九四六年在伦敦达成的安排而不得当选的亚非国家能够参加安全理事会，以便它们可能对维护国际和平和安全作出更有效的贡献。
    二、亚非会议考虑了目前国际紧张局势的危险情势和整个人类面临的爆发世界大战的危险——在这种战争中将会使用包括核子武器和热核子武器的所有种类的军备的毁灭性力量——，兹促请所有国家注意这样一种战争爆发后所会带来的可怕后果。
    会议认为裁减军备和禁止生产、试验和使用核子和热核子作战武器，对于拯救人类和文明免受大规模毁灭的恐惧和前景是必要的。
    它认为，在这里开会的亚非国家，为了人类和文明，有责任宣布它们支持裁军和禁止这些武器并呼吁主要有关国家和世界舆论来促进裁军和禁止这些武器。
    会议认为应当建立和维持有效的国际监督来实施裁军和禁止这些武器，并且应当作出迅速的和坚决的努力以达到这个目的。
    在完全禁止制造核子武器和热核子武器之前，本会议呼吁所有有关国家达成协议停止试验这种武器。
    庚、关于促进世界和平和
          合作的宣言
    亚非会议焦虑地看待世界和平和合作问题。会议对具有可能发生一场原子世界战争的危险的目前国际紧张局势，表示深切的关怀。和平问题同国际安全问题是互相关联的。在这方面，一切国家都应当合作，特别是通过联合国以促成在有效的国际监督下裁减军备和消除核子武器。这样，国际和平就可以促进，核子能就可以完全用于和平的目的。这将有助于满足特别是亚洲和非洲的需要，因为他们迫切的要求是社会进步和在更大的自由条件下提高生活水平。
    自由和和平是相互依靠的，自决的权利必须为一切国家的人民所享有，自由和独立必须尽可能不予拖延地给予现在仍旧是附属国人民的人们。的确，一切国家都应当有权按照联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，自由选择它们自己的政治和经济制度和它们自己的生活方式。
    各国应当在消除不信任和恐惧、彼此以信任和亲善相待的情况下，发挥容忍精神，作为和睦的邻邦彼此和平相处，并在下列原则的基础上发展友好合作：
    一、尊重基本人权、尊重联合国宪章的宗旨和原则。
    二、尊重一切国家的主权和领土完整。
    三、承认一切种族平等、承认一切大小国家平等。
    四、不过问或干涉他国内政。
    五、尊重每一国家按照联合国宪章单独地或集体地进行自卫的权利。
    六、（甲）不使用集体防御的安排来为任何一个大国的特殊利益服务；
        （乙）任何国家不对其他国家施加压力。
    七、不以侵略行为或侵略威胁，或使用武力来侵犯任何国家的领土完整或政治独立。
    八、按照联合国宪章，通过如谈判、调停、仲裁或司法解决等和平手段以及有关方面自己选择的任何其他和平手段来解决一切国际纠纷。
    九、促进相互的利益和合作。
    十、尊重正义和国际义务。
    亚非会议宣布它确信按照这些原则的友好合作对于维持和促进国际和平和安全将会作出有效的贡献，而在经济、社会和文化方面的合作将有助于促进大家的共同繁荣和福利。
    亚非会议建议五个发起国在同与会国协商之下，考虑召开亚非会议下届会议的问题。
