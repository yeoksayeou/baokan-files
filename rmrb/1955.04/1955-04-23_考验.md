    The Asian-African Conference moved from the "Independence" Building to the "Red and White Flag" Building, and the three committees—political, economic, and cultural—have been working for two more days.

    Although the meetings are not open to the public, the newspapers here have provided relatively detailed reports on the progress of the three committees. Meanwhile, how to find common ground to reach agreements on various issues remains the focus of public opinion.

    As of today, the work of the Cultural Committee is nearing completion. Participating countries have distributed their opinions at the meeting, including specific measures for cultural cooperation between Asian and African countries, such as mutual translation of books and periodicals, exchange of professors, and sending students to each other. Representatives expressed satisfaction with the general similarity of their opinions. Although during the discussion, South Vietnam arbitrarily stated that cultural exchanges could not be carried out due to different social systems, and the Philippines opposed so-called "propaganda in cultural exchanges," almost all representatives pointed out the importance of cultural cooperation between Asian and African countries.

    The Economic Committee has five items for discussion, namely:
  (1) Cooperation in economic development; (2) Cooperation in developing trade; (3) Cooperation in other areas;
  (4) Promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy; (5) Organizational issues (the last issue was referred by the Political Committee, attended by the heads of delegations from each participating country). On the issue of economic cooperation, all representatives believed that cooperation between Asian and African countries was essential in both technical and financial terms. Many representatives stated that in addition to intra-regional cooperation, they would not reject normal assistance from outside the region, but foreign aid should not be attached with political conditions. On the issue of trade, participants unanimously supported cooperation; many representatives opposed blockades and embargoes; and expressed indignation at the piratical acts of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique directed by the United States. On the issue of organization, some representatives believed that it was necessary to establish a permanent organization, while others believed that only a liaison committee of a small number of countries was needed. On the issue of atomic energy, everyone unanimously supported promoting the peaceful use of atomic energy. All of the above opinions were drafted into a report by a drafting committee composed of seven countries, which was to be submitted to the conference for discussion by the committee.

    At the Political Committee, attended by the heads of delegations from each participating country, it is reported that preliminary common opinions have been reached on the issues of human rights and national self-determination, the Palestine issue, racial discrimination, West Irian issue, etc. Currently under discussion and pending discussion are issues such as dependent territories and promoting world peace and cooperation.

    It is quite clear that, judging from the work of the three committees, the Asian-African Conference has been making continuous progress in the past few days. As long as the participating countries give full play to the spirit of consultation, the success of the conference is within sight. This is why the public here is paying close attention to the spirit and attitude of the representatives of the participating countries in their speeches.

    As reflected in the previous dispatches, Indonesian public opinion has continued to praise Premier Zhou's efforts to seek common ground while reserving differences, his sincerity in achieving peaceful cooperation between Asian and African countries, and his statesmanlike demeanor. At the same time, regret was expressed for the speeches by representatives of Iraq and other countries attacking communism at the conference. An editorial in the English-language Indonesian "Observer" stated, "This important Asian-African conference is not built on the basis of what kind of political system the world should adopt. On the contrary, the general hope is to seek the happiness of the millions of Asian and African people who have suffered enough in the past on the basis of concrete and mutually beneficial foundations for Asian and African countries." "Regrettably, the representatives of Iraq and the Philippines, acting as spokesmen for Western countries, launched attacks on communism, overshadowing the main issues."

    However, what is even more regrettable is that on the 21st, Mr. Kotelawala, the Prime Minister of Ceylon, distorted history and objective facts at a sudden press conference, attempting to deny that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory. He also attacked communist parties in various countries as "subversive" elements, seemingly wanting the Asian-African Conference to pass a resolution to dissolve communist parties in various countries and the governments led by them before he would be satisfied. People know that the United States hopes to undermine the Asian-African Conference by creating disputes and divisions. However, as one of the initiators of the Asian-African Conference, what is the intention of the Prime Minister of Ceylon in making such easily contentious remarks? Does this conform to the original intentions of the five prime ministers in convening the Asian-African Conference? According to local press reports, Mr. Kotelawala once again made similar remarks at the Political Committee yesterday (the 21st). This morning, representatives from countries such as Pakistan, Turkey, and Lebanon followed the example of the representative of Ceylon. This has aroused suspicion in many quarters. In any case, this is not conducive to the smooth progress of the conference. It is widely rumored here that after Premier Zhou's speech aroused widespread praise, the American "representatives" in Bandung became even more active in order to make the conference develop in the direction they wanted.

    Now, the issue is very clear: the people of Asian and African countries, as well as peace-loving people all over the world, have expressed their attention to the Asian-African Conference, hoping that it can make achievements in maintaining world peace and strengthening cooperation between Asian and African countries. The key issue is whether the representatives of the participating countries are willing to seek common ground as much as possible to reach agreements that meet the hopes of the people. Here, the sincerity of the representatives of the participating countries is being tested. Bandung, April 22nd

    从“独立”大厦迁到“红白旗”大厦，亚非会议分成政治、经济和文化三个委员会进行工作，又是两天了。
    尽管会议是不公开的，但这里的报纸对于三个委员会的进展情况都有较详细的反映；同时，如何找寻共同的基础以达到对于各项问题的协议，仍然是舆论界关心的焦点。
    到今天，文化委员会的工作，已经接近完成了。与会国在会上散发了它们的意见书，其中包括亚非各国间文化合作的各项具体办法，如互译书刊、互派教授、互送学生等。代表们对于彼此意见的一般相近表示快慰。虽然在讨论中南越武断地提出了社会制度不同不能进行文化交流，菲律宾提出反对所谓在“文化交流中进行宣传”，但几乎所有的代表都指出亚非国家间文化合作的重要性。
    在经济委员会里，共有五项讨论议题，即：
  （一）经济发展方面的合作问题；（二）发展贸易方面的合作问题；（三）其他方面的合作问题；
  （四）促进核子能的和平用途问题；（五）组织方面的问题（最后一个问题是各与会国团长参加的政治委员会交议的）。在经济合作问题上，各代表均认为不论在技术和财政上亚非国家间的合作十分必要。不少代表表示除本区合作外，亦不拒绝外区正常援助，但外援绝不能附带有政治条件。在贸易问题上，与会者更一致赞成合作；很多代表反对封锁禁运；对于美国指使的蒋介石卖国集团的海盗行为，表示愤激。在组织方面的问题上，部分代表认为有设立的必要，部分代表则认为只设一少数国家的联络委员会即可。在原子能问题上，大家一致赞成促进和平使用原子能。所有以上意见，由一个七国组成的起草委员会起草报告书，由委员会讨论后提交大会。
    在各代表团团长参加的政治委员会上，据悉日来对于人权与民族自决权问题、巴勒斯坦问题、种族歧视问题、西伊里安问题……都有了初步的共同的意见。目前正在讨论和尚待讨论的是附属国问题和促进世界和平和合作等问题。
    十分明显，从三个委员会的工作情形看，几天来的亚非会议是在不断向前进展的。只要与会国家充分发挥协商精神，会议的成就是可以指日而待的。这就是为什么此间舆论十分注意与会国代表们在发言中的精神和态度的原因。
    正如前次通讯里所反映的，这两天来印度尼西亚舆论界继续赞扬周总理的求同存异、诚心诚意为达到亚非国家间的和平合作所作的努力和他的政治家的风度；同时，对于伊拉克等国代表在会议上攻击共产主义的演说表示遗憾。英文印度尼西亚“观察者报”的社论就说，“这个重大的亚非会议并不是建筑在这个世界应采取何种政治制度的观念基础上。相反的，一般的希望是在亚非国家具体的和共同有利的基础上去寻求过去曾受够苦难的千百万亚非人民的幸福。”“遗憾得很，伊拉克和菲律宾代表以西方国家代言人的姿态展开对共产主义的进攻，致使主要问题黯然无光。”
    可是，令人更加遗憾的是二十一日锡兰总理科特拉瓦拉先生在突如其来的一次记者招待会上歪曲历史和客观事实，竟想否认台湾是中国领土的一部分。他还攻击各国共产党为“颠覆活动”者，似乎想要亚非会议通过决议解散各国共产党和共产党领导的政府而后快的样子。人们晓得，美国是希望用制造争端和分歧来破坏亚非会议的。但是，以亚非会议的发起国代表人之一的锡兰总理来发表这样容易引起纠纷的言论，其用意究竟何在呢？难道这符合于五国总理召开亚非会议的初衷吗？据本地报界消息，科特拉瓦拉先生在昨天（二十一日）的政治委员会上，又一次发表了类似言论。今天上午，又有巴基斯坦、土耳其、黎巴嫩等国代表步锡兰代表后尘。这引起了不少方面的怀疑。无论如何，这对会议的顺利进行是不利的。这里盛传，在周总理讲话引起了普遍好评之后，美国在万隆的“代表”们就更加积极活动，以便使会议向他们所要求的方向发展。
    现在，问题是十分清楚的：亚非国家人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民都表示了对于亚非会议的重视，希望它能对维护世界和平、加强亚非各国间的合作作出成就。关键的问题就在于与会国的代表们要不要尽量寻求共同的基础，来达成符合于人民希望的协议。在这里，与会各国代表们的诚意正在受到考验。二十二日于万隆
