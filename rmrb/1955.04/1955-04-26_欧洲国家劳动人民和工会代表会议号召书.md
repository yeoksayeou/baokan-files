Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, April 25th: The Conference of Representatives of Working People and Trade Unions of European Countries adopted the "Leipzig Conference Appeal to Trade Unions and Working Men and Women of Europe."

    The appeal first addresses all working men and women in Europe in the name of the representatives of the working people from twenty-five countries, representing various tendencies, and various political beliefs, philosophies, and religions: The ratification of the Paris Agreements poses a threat to European security and world peace. Implementing the Paris Agreements and preparing for an atomic war will harm your interests and will further accelerate the arms race, increase military budgets, thereby intensifying the exploitation by capitalist enterprises and subjecting your trade union and democratic rights to increasingly brutal attacks.

    The appeal then points out: The working people of Europe want to live a happy life and want peace in Europe and the world. The unanimous opposition of the working people in all European countries to the revival of German militarism and the establishment of aggressive military blocs expresses this desire for happiness and peace. It shows that there is a powerful and inexhaustible force among the working masses, among the people, who are determined to defend the cause of peace at all costs. This force and the countless achievements it has already made are our guarantee for realizing our hopes and achieving victory.

    The appeal then calls on the German working people to unite against the implementation of the Paris Agreements, to fight against those who attempt to drag the German people into a fratricidal war, and to fight for the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peaceful Germany. The appeal says: The support of the international working class is a strong pillar of your struggle for this just cause.

    The appeal points out to all working men and women in Europe: Unity is strength. United, you can use your struggle to stop the implementation of the Paris Agreements, shatter the evil plans to prepare for an atomic war, and strive for the resolution of international issues not through strength but through negotiation.

    Finally, the appeal calls on the working people of Europe to strengthen domestic and international worker solidarity, consolidate their ranks, fight against the revival of German militarism and the implementation of the belligerent plans of international reactionaries, to support the international movement to collect signatures for the "Appeal to the People of the World" against the preparation of atomic war, to fight for wage increases and new social benefits, and to obtain and defend the trade union rights and democratic rights of the working people.

    欧洲国家劳动人民和工会代表会议号召书
    新华社二十五日讯　据塔斯社来比锡二十五日讯：欧洲国家劳动人民和工会代表会议通过了“来比锡会议对欧洲各工会和男女劳动人民的号召书”。
    号召书首先以代表着各种倾向的工会和各种不同的政治信念、哲学和宗教信仰的二十五个国家劳动人民代表的名义，向全欧洲的男女劳动人民发出呼吁说：巴黎协定的批准对欧洲安全和世界和平造成了威胁。实现巴黎协定和准备原子战争都将损害你们的利益，并且将使军备竞赛更为加速，军事预算日益庞大，从而使资本主义企业的剥削加紧，使你们的工会和民主权利遭到越来越多的残暴的进攻。
    号召书接着指出：欧洲劳动人民希望过幸福的生活，希望欧洲和世界和平。劳动人民在欧洲所有的国家一致反对复活德国军国主义和建立军事侵略集团的斗争，表达了这种要求幸福和和平的愿望。它表明：在劳动群众中，在人民中蕴藏着强大的无穷无尽的力量，他们决心奋不顾身地将和平事业保卫到底。这种力量和这种力量已经取得的无数的成就是我们实现希望和取得胜利的保证。
    号召书接着号召德国劳动人民团结起来，反对实施巴黎协定，同那些企图把德国人拖入自相残杀的战争的人斗争，并且为建立统一、民主、和平的德国而斗争。号召书说：国际工人的支援是你们为这个正义事业而进行的斗争的坚强支柱。
    号召书向全欧洲的男女劳动人民指出：团结就是力量。团结起来就能够用自己的斗争阻止巴黎协定的实施，粉碎准备原子战争的罪恶计划，争取到不是用实力而是用谈判的方式解决国际问题。
    号召书最后号召欧洲劳动人民加强国内和国际的工人团结，巩固队伍，为反对德国军国主义的复活和国际反动派的好战计划的实施、为支持为反对准备原子战争的“告全世界人民书”征集签名的国际运动、为争取工资的提高和新的社会福利、为取得和维护劳动人民的工会权利和民主权利而斗争。
