Farmers in Minority Areas Welcome New Farm Tools

    In order to help farmers in various minority areas improve farming techniques and do a good job in spring plowing, supply and marketing departments in various places have successively transported various new farm tools to various minority areas. These new farm tools have been warmly welcomed by farmers of all ethnic groups. During this year's spring plowing, the Muya District of Kangding County, Xikang Province, promoted 200 new walking plows and 19 animal-powered six-row seeders. Seven agricultural technology promotion stations in the district have jointly held three new animal-powered farm tool training courses, attracting more than 190 Tibetan and Han farmers to study here.

    Xunhua County in Qinghai Province also organized horse-drawn seeders to carry out substitute plowing and sowing for agricultural production cooperatives in Qingshui Township, the Salar Autonomous Region. In just thirteen days, Qingshui Township basically completed the sowing work. The benefits of the new farm tools inspired the production enthusiasm of the Salar, Tibetan, Hui, and Han farmers in the township. They are determined to work hard to improve farming techniques, strive to produce more grain, and complete this year's production plan.

    The Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Xikang Province purchased more than 100 animal-powered six-row seeders from the Shenyang Farm Tool Factory. Staff members of the agricultural technology promotion station are teaching Tibetan farmers how to use this seeder.

    少数民族地区农民欢迎新式农具
    为了帮助各少数民族地区农民改进耕作技术，作好春耕生产工作，各地供销部门已将各种新式农具陆续运到各少数民族地区。这些新式农具受到各族农民的热烈欢迎。西康省康定县木雅区今年春耕期间就推广了二百部新式步犁和十九部畜力六行播种机。全区七个农业技术推广站先后联合举办了三个新式畜力农具训练班，吸收了一百九十多个藏族和汉族农民到这里来学习。
    青海省循化县也组织了马拉播种机，为撒拉族自治区清水乡的农业生产合作社进行代耕、代播。在短短的十三天中清水乡就基本完成了播种工作，新式农具的好处鼓舞了全乡撒拉族、藏族、回族和汉族农民的生产热情，他们决心努力改进耕作技术，争取多打粮食，完成今年的生产计划。
