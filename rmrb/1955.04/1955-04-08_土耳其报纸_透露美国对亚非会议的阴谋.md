    Turkish Newspapers
    Reveal American Conspiracy Against the Asian-African Conference
    Xinhua News Agency, April 6th, TASS, Ankara, April 5th: The Turkish newspaper "Halksi" published an article by reporter Ismail, titled "Activities Surrounding the Asian-African Conference." He believes that India, Burma, Indonesia, and other Asian countries that have not participated in U.S.-British military conspiracies may turn the upcoming Asian-African Conference into a "demonstration against colonialism and imperialism."

    Ismail said that those "countries cooperating with the West," in other words, those countries that have already been drawn into the American military bloc system, "must not succumb to this tendency," and on the contrary, they must protect the United States at the conference and prevent it from being criticized.

    He revealed that Turkey, as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, will join forces with Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand, members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, at the conference, and with the support of Iraq and Iran, will advocate the West's policy of strength. He wrote that in order to prepare appropriate plans, these countries "must now establish contact among themselves."

    土耳其报纸
    透露美国对亚非会议的阴谋
    新华社六日讯　塔斯社安卡拉五日电：土耳其“哈尔克西报”发表了记者伊斯梅尔写的一篇文章，题目是“环绕着亚非会议的活动”。他认为，没有参加美英军事阴谋的印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和其他亚洲国家可能会把即将到来的亚非会议变成一个“反对殖民主义和帝国主义的示威”。
    伊斯梅尔说，那些“同西方合作的国家”，换句话说，就是那些已经被拉进美国军事集团体系的国家，“必须不要顺从这种倾向”，而且相反的，他们还必须在会议上保护美国，使之不受批评。
    他透露，作为北大西洋公约组织成员国的土耳其在会议上要同东南亚条约组织的成员国巴基斯坦、菲律宾和泰国联合起来，在伊拉克和伊朗的支持下，鼓吹西方的实力政策。他写道，为了准备好适当的计划，这些国家“现在必须在他们之间建立联系”。
