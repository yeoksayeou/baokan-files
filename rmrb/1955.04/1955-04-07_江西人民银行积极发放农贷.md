    Jiangxi People's Bank Actively Issues Agricultural Loans
    Since the beginning of spring, People's Banks in various parts of Jiangxi Province have actively issued a batch of agricultural loans. Currently, the province has already issued 2.05 million yuan in loans. This batch of loans has strongly supported farmers' spring plowing preparation work. The People's Bank of Yongxin County lent 22,900 yuan to 112 agricultural production cooperatives, helping them purchase 321 head of draught cattle, which promptly solved the problem of insufficient animal power during spring plowing. The People's Bank of Yujiang County, in coordination with the local cattle exchange fair, issued loans of 10,160 yuan, helping farmers purchase 169 head of draught cattle. Huang Yangfu, a member of the Shengli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shuangnong Township, Fourth District of the county, borrowed 80 yuan from the bank and bought two fat, strong bulls at the exchange fair. He happily said: "If you want good cattle, you can pick and choose at the exchange fair; if you don't have money, the bank will lend it to you immediately. This year, we must do a good job in production, strive for increased production, and repay the loans promptly after the autumn harvest."

    江西人民银行积极发放农贷
    入春以来，江西省各地人民银行积极发放了一批农业贷款。现在全省已经发放贷款二百零五万元。这批贷款有力地支持了农民的春耕生产准备工作。永新县的人民银行贷给一百一十二个农业生产合作社二万二千九百元，帮助他们购买了三百二十一头耕牛，及时解决了春耕中畜力不足的问题。余江县的人民银行配合当地举行的耕牛交流会，发放贷款一万零一百六十元，帮助农民购买了一百六十九头耕牛。该县第四区双农乡胜利农业生产合作社社员黄样福向银行贷款八十元，在交流会上买回两头肥壮的公牛。他高兴地说：“要好牛，可以在交流会上任意挑选；没有钱，银行马上就贷款。今年我们一定要搞好生产，争取增产，并且在秋后及时归还贷款。”
