Correcting Shortcomings in the Implementation of the "Three Fixes" Policy

The Mancheng County, Hebei Province recently dispatched an inspection team to focus on investigating the situation of various townships in publicizing and implementing the "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" policy for grain. The inspection team found that the work team of Baoyang Township had not yet publicized the policy to the masses even four or five days after the county committee had arranged for this work. In order to complete the cotton planting plan, Chengnei Township deliberately increased the expected yield of spring millet from 200 jin to 300 jin, forcing the masses to plant more cotton. Some townships, although they publicized the grain "Three Fixes" policy to the masses, it was neither extensive nor in-depth, but merely a perfunctory publicity, and most of the masses did not know what the "Three Fixes" was all about.

In order to correct and prevent this situation, the Mancheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China has instructed the cadres going to the countryside to conscientiously study the grain "Three Fixes" policy and the policies of consolidating cooperatives and spring plowing production, and to specifically assist various townships in arranging various tasks according to the county committee's work plan, and to properly organize cadre forces. The county committee requires that the publicity of the grain "Three Fixes" policy must be based on the spirit of the policy, and must be known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The county committee also instructed that in implementing the grain "Three Fixes" policy, various townships should closely integrate it with the supplementary work of unified grain purchase to ensure that the two tasks are done simultaneously.

    纠正执行“三定”政策中的缺点
    河北省满城县最近派出检查组，重点调查各乡宣传贯彻粮食“定产、定购、定销”政策的情况。检查组发现抱阳乡工作组在县委布置这一工作四五天以后还没有向群众宣传。城内乡为了完成种棉计划，故意把春地谷子由实产二百斤提高到应产三百斤，迫使群众多种棉花。有的乡虽然向群众宣传了粮食“三定”政策，但既不广泛、更不深入，只是草草宣传一下了事，大部分群众还不知道“三定”是怎么回事。
    为了纠正和防止这种情况，中共满城县委已指示下乡干部必须认真学习粮食“三定”政策和巩固合作社、春耕生产的政策，根据县委工作方案具体帮助各乡安排各项工作，妥善地组织干部力量。粮食“三定”政策的宣传，县委要求必须根据政策精神，并且做到家喻户晓，深入人心。县委还指示各乡在贯彻粮食“三定”政策时，要和粮食统购补课工作密切结合，保证把两项工作同时做好。
