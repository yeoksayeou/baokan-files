Zhejiang Province is vigorously promoting the "Dazi Cotton No. 15" improved variety in cotton-growing areas and strengthening technical guidance in cotton planting to strive for high yields on the province's 1.2 million mu of cotton fields.

Zhejiang Province plans to promote Dazi cotton improved varieties on 600,000 mu this year. Currently, the acquisition, transfer, and supply of Dazi cotton improved varieties have been basically completed. By the end of March, various counties had also successively completed the seed selection of improved cotton varieties.

In order to strengthen cotton planting guidance and improve cultivation techniques, eleven technical extension stations were established in the major cotton-producing areas of Xiaoshan, Cixi, and Yuyao in February and March. Cotton farmer technical training classes were also held, providing over 3,000 cotton farmers with training in planting techniques. Currently, cotton-producing counties are holding short-term cotton farmer training classes lasting four to six days in districts and townships in stages to impart cotton cultivation techniques.
