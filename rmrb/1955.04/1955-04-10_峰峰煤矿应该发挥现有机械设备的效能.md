    Fengfeng Coal Mine Should Maximize the Effectiveness of Existing Mechanical Equipment
    Zhang Lide
    In recent years, the degree of mechanization at Fengfeng Coal Mine has significantly improved. In 1954, the number of various machines increased fourteenfold compared to 1950. In Mines No. 1, 2, 3, and 4, the proportion of mechanized coal mining increased from 23.6 percent in 1950 to 88.3 percent in 1954. The proportion of mechanized coal transportation in the recovery working face increased from 10.8 percent to 93.3 percent. The proportion of mechanized transportation in the flat roadways increased from 14 percent to 48.4 percent. Due to the increased mechanization, labor productivity has also significantly improved, and working conditions within the enterprise have been further improved. The overall efficiency of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau has increased from 0.644 tons in 1950 to 0.8581 tons in 1954. Among them, the labor productivity of the Fourth Mine in 1954 increased by 67.3 percent compared to 1950.
    However, with the gradual increase in mechanical equipment, many shortcomings and problems have also been exposed in maximizing the effectiveness of existing mechanical equipment. Many enterprises have not reached the state-prescribed mechanization targets. For example, in 1954, only 97.7 percent of the state plan for mechanized coal mining was completed. If coal mining by explosive blasting is not included, the mechanization target was only 44.41 percent of the plan. Mechanized transportation in the recovery working face only completed 74.6 percent of the state plan, and mechanized transportation in flat roadways only completed 84.77 percent of the state plan. The utilization rate of mechanical equipment is even worse, and some indicators have even regressed compared to 1953. For example, the proportion of mechanized transportation in the working face was 94 percent in 1953, but decreased to 92.5 percent in 1954. Furthermore, the proportion of coal cut by coal cutters in the total output was 28.04 percent in 1953, but only 19.01 percent in 1954. In particular, Mine No. 2 did not complete the state-prescribed mechanization targets from coal mining to transportation, and from underground to aboveground.
    Due to the very low utilization rate of mechanical equipment, the increase in labor productivity has been hindered to a certain extent. In 1954, the efficiency of the recovery workers at the Fengfeng Mining Bureau not only did not improve, but decreased by 2.11 percent compared to 1953. Moreover, with the increase in various mechanical equipment, depreciation costs have also increased accordingly. The depreciation costs for mechanical equipment that the mine should have used but did not use in 1954 amounted to more than 12,000 yuan. This has affected the reduction of enterprise cost expenses to some extent, which is also one of the important reasons why the unit cost of the mine increased by 3.2 percent compared to 1953.
    What is most unacceptable is that the phenomenon of "human-pulled baskets" still exists in the mines under the Fengfeng Mining Bureau, and it still accounts for a considerable proportion. According to statistics from the Fourth Mine, in December 1954, there were still an average of 61 workers pulling baskets every day. In 1954, the Second Mine completed 26,984 meters of tunneling, of which workers pulling cars accounted for 31.8 percent of all transportation workers in the working face. The distance of pulling baskets is sometimes as long as 100 meters or more. As of January this year, the above situation has not changed.
    Why is the utilization rate of mechanized equipment in Fengfeng Coal Mine so low, and how can the degree of mechanization be improved? Based on the situation of various mines in Fengfeng, the following issues are worth studying.
    First of all, it is necessary to overcome the one-sidedness in the Party committee's supervision of production. Some factories and mines party committees believe that: "It is unacceptable not to complete the production tasks, but it doesn't matter if the mechanization targets are not completed." Therefore, they lack forceful criticism of various conservative ideas and resistance in the process of promoting mechanization, and rarely publicize the great significance of improving the mechanization of the production process to the workers, making the role of the Party organization in leading and supervising mechanization very weak.
    To exert the Party organization's leadership and supervisory role in mechanization work, it is necessary to constantly educate the broad masses of workers to recognize the great significance of mechanizing the production process. The First Mine has done a good job in this regard. Last September, the Party committee of the First Mine organized cadres to conduct inspections on the low utilization rate of various machines. It was found that in the past, only plans were made and machines were requested, but no one considered where to use the machines and who would use them. The Party committee of the First Mine organized inspections among leading cadres and conducted education on the use of machines among the broad masses of workers, implemented the resolution on cyclic operations, and widely utilized mechanization of the production process in each mining area to achieve one cycle per day and night, so that the degree of mechanized coal transportation in the working face of the mine in the fourth quarter increased by 54.8 percent compared with the third quarter. The utilization rate of coal cutters increased from 4 percent in the third quarter to 46.7 percent in the fourth quarter.
    The second aspect of the Party committee's political and ideological work should focus on overcoming the resistant sentiment of some grassroots cadres. Coal mine production is underground work, and the use of mechanization must have a safe environment. Therefore, mechanization of the production process is not only a rigorous technical work, but also a complex organizational work. It first requires the shift leader to have a high sense of responsibility and strictly implement technical and organizational measures, but many shift leaders have lazy ideas of fearing trouble and seeking convenience. Party organizations in various factories and mines have also generally neglected their education. Last September, the 427 working face of the Fourth Mine successfully tested coal cutting with a coal cutter at the bottom layer. The leadership felt: "There is no problem." But they did not know that the grassroots cadres had always resisted this test. In the end, it was stopped because the shift leader did not operate according to the prescribed measures.
    The third aspect of the Party committee's political work is to supervise and help administrative leaders establish the determination to complete the state's economic and technical indicators. Some cadres often say in words how important mechanization is, but when these indicators cannot be fulfilled, they do not go deep into the lower levels to understand the situation, study the reasons, and specifically help the lower-level cadres solve the problems existing in the promotion of mechanization. Instead, they often remain silent. This, to some extent, fuels the negative sentiment of the lower-level cadres who believe that "the conditions here are poor and machines cannot be used." Facts have proved that as long as the leading cadres earnestly help the grassroots cadres, overcome difficulties, and create conditions for the use of machines, even mines with poor geological conditions can fully utilize machines. The leading cadres of the First Workshop of the Second Mine did a lot of ideological work and organizational work, and concentrated the wisdom of the workers on creating conditions for the use of machines and strictly implementing operating procedures and systems, so that the 213 heading, in the case of continuous roof collapse in the second quarter of last year, not only controlled the roof, but also created an environment conducive to the work of the coal cutter. Therefore, in the complex geological conditions, the coal cutter was not stopped, ensuring the task of producing 500 tons of coal per day and night in this working face. The experience of this heading, which has been using machines continuously for nearly a year, proves that the mechanization of the production process plays a decisive role in completing various state indicators.
    Secondly, strengthening technical leadership and learning technology is an important issue that urgently needs to be resolved in the current promotion of mechanization.
    To push the current degree of mechanization in the coal mining industry further forward on the existing basis is a complex technical work. It is necessary to make workers familiar with technology, master technology, and require them to strictly abide by technical operation and technical safety regulations. In 1954, the Fengfeng Mining Bureau successively transferred 383 workers from various work positions to carry out various professional and technical training, so that their operating skills have been improved to a certain extent. But this is far from keeping up with the needs of the current work. The Electromechanical Section of the Fourth Mine conducted a general knowledge examination for all types of drivers in the mine in December 1954, of which only 12 passed. Due to the weakness of technical forces and the lack of necessary management systems in technical work, a total of 448 electromechanical accidents occurred throughout the year in the Fengfeng Mining Bureau in 1954, locally affecting production for 1,296 hours.
    There is also a very important issue in this regard, that is, the leadership has abandoned the investigation and handling of the persons responsible for the accidents, and cannot learn lessons from the accidents and improve their work, so the specific situation of 448 accidents throughout the year is a linear increase.
    Third, in order to correct the current negative attitude of some cadres who take a laissez-faire approach to mechanization indicators, the higher-level administrative management departments should specifically formulate some systems that are beneficial to the promotion of mechanization and change some systems that are unfavorable to the promotion of mechanization.
    An analysis and research system for the completion of mechanization indicators by administrative leaders should be established regularly from top to bottom. At present, various factories and mines generally have the habit of analyzing and researching the completion of indicators such as output, efficiency, and cost. However, little attention is paid to the completion of mechanization indicators. Therefore, in the future, mechanization indicators must be treated the same as other indicators, and responsibility must be pursued, reasons must be found, and measures must be taken. Only in this way can the strength of cadres be organized to regularly analyze and study and solve the problems existing in mechanization work. It is necessary to summarize the experiences of using mechanization that have been successfully tested in various different coal seams, study which problems exist, which methods can be used, and which methods cannot be used, technically appraise them, and improve them in management methods. Then, the leading organs should formulate unified regulations and order the various mines to strictly implement them.
    The current unreasonable wage system should also be changed. At present, there are two wage systems in direct coal mining work in various mines. Electromechanical technical workers are paid fixed wages, while coal mining, digging coal, and prop workers are paid piece-rate wages. Electromechanical technical workers are mostly workers above Grade 6, earning high wages, but the actual working hours often do not reach the statutory working hours. Sometimes they have to sit and watch the machinery. Electromechanical workers also feel that their role has not been fully utilized, "earning Grade 6 wages without doing Grade 6 work, the country is at a loss." Workers also have some opinions because of this. Recently, the 215 working face of the Second Mine and the First Workshop of the Fourth Mine conducted research based on the above situation and stipulated that the working face is not allowed to have the phenomenon of earning fixed points. The First Workshop of the Fourth Mine changed to a unified piece-rate wage, and the 215 working face of the Second Mine implemented a method of paying drivers the highest wages of the planer installers on the basis of piece-rate wages, changing the past situation of "doing half-hearted work".
    Fourth, effective measures should be taken immediately to gradually change the phenomenon of human-pulled baskets.

    峰峰煤矿应该发挥现有机械设备的效能
    张立德
    几年来峰峰煤矿的机械化程度有了显著提高，一九五四年各种机械数量比一九五零年增加了十四倍。一、二、三、四矿机械化采煤的比例一九五零年为百分之二十三点六，一九五四年已提高到百分之八十八点三，回采工作面机械化运煤的比例由百分之十点八提高到百分之九十三点三，平巷机械化运搬的比例由百分之十四提高到百分之四十八点四。由于机械化程度的提高，劳动生产率也显著提高，企业内部的劳动条件得到进一步的改善。峰峰矿务局的全员效率已由一九五零年的零点六四四吨提高到一九五四年的零点八五八一吨。其中第四矿的劳动生产率一九五四年比一九五零年提高了百分之六十七点三。
    但是随着机械设备的逐年增加，在发挥现有机械设备的效能方面，也暴露出不少缺点和问题。很多企业没有达到国家规定的机械化的指标。如一九五四年采煤机械化只完成国家计划的百分之九十七点七，如果不包括火药爆破采煤，机械化指标仅完成计划百分之四十四点四一，回采工作面运输机械化只完成国家计划百分之七十四点六，平巷运搬机械化只完成国家计划百分之八十四点七七。机械设备利用率更差，甚而某些指标不是比一九五三年进步而是倒退了。如工作面运搬机械化所占比重一九五三年是百分之九十四，而一九五四年却降至百分之九十二点五。再如截煤机截煤在总产量中所占的比重，一九五三年是百分之二十八点零四，而一九五四年则是百分之一十九点零一。特别是二矿，从采煤到运搬，从坑下到坑上都没有完成国家规定的机械化的指标。
    由于机械设备的利用率很低，就使劳动生产率的提高受到了一定程度的阻碍。一九五四年峰峰矿务局的回采工的效率不仅没有提高，反倒比一九五三年降低了百分之二点一一。而且随着各种机械设备的增多，折旧费用也相应增多，该矿一九五四年应该利用而没有利用的机械设备，就多支出了折旧费用一万二千余元。在某种程度上影响了企业成本费用的降低，这也是该矿单位成本比一九五三年提高百分之三点二的重要原因之一。
    最不能容许的是峰峰矿务局所属各矿直到现在仍旧存在着“人拉筐”的现象，并且还占了不小的比重。据第四矿统计，一九五四年十二月平均每天还有六十一个拉筐工人。第二矿一九五四年完成两万六千九百八十四公尺的掘进任务，其中人拉车工竟达工作面全部运输工数的百分之三十一点八。而拉筐距离有的竟长达百公尺以上。到今年一月份，上述情况依然没有改变。
    为什么峰峰煤矿机械化设备利用率这样低呢，怎样才能使机械化程度提高呢？根据峰峰各矿情况，有以下几个问题值得研究。
    首先需要克服党委监督生产中的片面性。有些厂矿党委认为：“完不成生产任务不行，机械化指标完不成算不了什么。”因此，他们对于推行机械化过程中的各种保守思想和抵触情绪缺乏有力的批判，很少向职工宣传提高生产过程的机械化的重大意义，使党的组织在领导和监督机械化方面的作用显得非常微弱。
    党组织要发挥在机械化工作方面的领导和监督作用，必须经常不断地教育广大职工群众认识生产过程机械化的重大意义。第一矿在这方面作得较好，去年九月一矿党委组织干部针对各种机器利用率低的情况作了检查。发现过去光造计划，要机器，机器来了往那里用，谁来用，没有人考虑，第一矿党委在领导干部中组织了检查并向广大职工进行了使用机械的教育，贯彻了循环作业的决议，各采区都为达到一昼夜一个循环广泛地利用了生产过程机械化，使该矿第四季度工作面运煤机械化程度比第三季度提高百分之五十四点八。而截煤机的利用率则由第三季的百分之四提高到第四季度的百分之四十六点七。
    党委在政治思想工作上的第二个方面应着重于克服某些基层干部的抵触情绪。煤矿生产是地下作业，使用机械化必须有安全的环境。因此生产过程的机械化不仅是严密的技术工作，也是复杂的组织工作。它首先要求带班长有高度责任感，严格执行技术措施和组织措施，但许多带班长存在着怕麻烦、图省事的懒惰思想。各厂矿党组织也普遍忽视对他们的教育，去年九月四矿四二七工作面在底层试验截煤机截煤成功，领导上觉得：“没有问题了。”却不知道基层干部对这一试验始终是有抵触的，最后终因带班长不按规定的措施进行操作而停止了。
    党委在政治工作上的第三个方面，是要监督和帮助行政领导干部树立完成国家经济技术指标的决心。有些干部在口头上也经常地说机械化如何如何的重要，但当这些指标不能兑现时，他们不是及时深入下层了解情况，研究原因，具体帮助下层干部解决推行机械化工作中存在的问题。反而常常是默不作声。这就在某种程度上助长了下边干部认为“我们这里的条件差，不能用机器”的消极情绪。事实证明只要领导干部认真帮助基层干部、克服困难，为使用机械创造条件，就是地质情况不好的矿井也是完全可以利用机械的。二矿第一车间的领导干部做了很多思想工作和组织工作，把工人的智慧集中到为使用机械创造条件以及严格执行操作规程制度上来，使二一三掌子在去年第二季伪顶不断塌落的情况下，既控制了顶板，又创造了有利于截煤机工作的环境，因而在复杂的地质情况下并没有停用截煤机，保证了这个工作面一昼夜一个循环日产五百吨煤的产量任务。这一个掌子经过将近一年来不间断地使用机器的经验，证明生产过程的机械化对完成国家各项指标起着决定性的作用。
    其次，加强技术领导，学习技术，是当前推行机械化工作上一个急待解决的重要问题。
    要把当前煤矿工业机械化程度在现有基础上向前推进一步，是一个复杂的技术工作。必须使工人熟悉技术、掌握技术，并要求他们严格遵守技术操作和技术保安规程。一九五四年峰峰矿务局先后从各个工作岗位上抽调了三百八十三名工人进行了各种专业技术的培训，使他们的操作技术，都有一定的提高。但这远不能赶上当前工作的需要。四矿机电科在一九五四年十二月对全矿各种司机手进行了一次常识考试，其中只有十二名及格。由于技术力量薄弱，技术工作中缺乏必要的管理制度，一九五四年峰峰矿务局全年共发生机电事故四百四十八次，局部影响生产一千二百九十六小时。
    在这方面还有一个很重要的问题，是领导上放弃了对于事故责任者的追查和处理，不能从事故中吸取教训，改进工作，因而全年四百四十八次事故在每月的具体情况是直线上升的。
    第三、为了纠正当前某些干部对机械化指标采取放任自流的消极态度，应由上级行政管理部门具体制定一些对推行机械化有益的制度，改变一些对推行机械化不利的制度。
    应该自上而下地、定期地、建立行政领导干部对机械化指标完成情况的分析研究制度。目前各厂矿对于产量、效率、成本等指标完成情况一般的已有了分析研究习惯。而对于机械化指标完成的情况则很少注意。因此，今后必须将机械化指标同其他指标一样看待，一样要追责任、找原因、采取措施。同时只有这样，才能把干部的力量组织到经常分析和研究解决机械化工作中存在的问题上去。要总结在各种不同煤层中已经试验成功的采用机械化的经验，研究其中存在着那些问题、哪一种方法是能用的，哪一种方法是不能用的，在技术上加以鉴定，在管理方法上加以提高。然后由领导机关制定出统一的规程，责令各矿严格执行。
    现行不合理的工资制度也应该改变。目前各矿在直接采煤工作上存在着两种工资制度，机电技术工人是固定工资，采煤攉煤支柱工是计件工资。机电技术工人大都是六级以上的工人，挣的是高工资，但实际工作时间往往达不到法定工时。有时只好坐着看机械。机电工人也觉得自己作用没有全部发挥，“挣六级工资没有干到六级活，国家吃亏了”。工人之间也因此有些意见。最近二矿二一五工作面，四矿第一车间根据上述情况进行了研究，规定工作面不允许有挣固定分的现象存在。四矿一车间改变为统一的计件工资、二矿二一五工作面在计件的基础上实行司机手按刨装工最高的工资发给的办法，改变了过去“干不干十分半”的情况。
    第四、应立即采取有效措施，逐步改变人拉筐的现象。
