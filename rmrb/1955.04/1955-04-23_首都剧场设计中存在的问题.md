Uphold Thrift, Oppose Waste in Capital Construction!
Problems in the Design of the Capital Theater
Ma Haoran

The Capital Theater, currently under construction, is a new type of theater in the capital that is relatively large in scale and well-equipped. The original design was for a drama theater, but it was later changed to a theater that could stage large-scale song and dance dramas. In recent years, due to the development of the arts in the capital and the continuous visits of many foreign art groups to our country, and because there is no large-scale theater in the capital, it is very necessary to build this theater.

In order to design this theater better, the Central Design Institute launched an internal design competition. However, instead of designing it to be more suitable and economical, they caused huge waste to the country. Currently, the construction unit has accepted the opinions of the construction unit and decided to modify the original design, cancel some unreasonable expansion plans, reduce some unnecessary decorations and expensive building materials, and reduce some of the imported equipment that can be reduced, which can save the country more than 1.5 million yuan. Of course, the theater was originally designed as a drama theater, and later it was changed to a large-scale song and dance theater that meets modern performance conditions. The change in the design task has caused certain difficulties and waste in design and construction. In addition, the high standard requirements and the lack of supervision over investment and use are all major responsibilities of the construction unit. But at the same time, there are more facts that can prove that much of the waste is caused by the designers not cherishing national property and blindly pursuing formal beauty.

The person in charge of the design of this building is the architect Lin Leyi. In order to make this new theater "truly meet new standards," the designers often do not design according to a complete work plan and objective conditions, but rely on subjective preferences and pursue novelty and innovation in form. For example, for the two column lamps like Huabiao on both sides of the main entrance, the designers insist on using a peculiar method to install a circle of light bulbs. A chandelier hanging in the center of the caisson ceiling in the lobby has also been made into a bizarre curved shape. In the lounge, the designers unreasonably, in order to find the so-called "smell of wood," prepared to make wood moldings on the flat ceiling after plastering, but he did not consider that it is difficult to nail wood moldings firmly on the steel wire mesh plastered flat ceiling. The designers also requested that the walls be nailed with "kuduan," a fabric second only to "brocade," which is very expensive. At that time, the architect did not think of this, and also did not consider that the plastered wall is damp, and if "kuduan" is nailed, it is also necessary to use plywood as a lining. Fortunately, "kuduan" was not bought, otherwise more money would have been wasted. In terms of the use of materials, the designers strived to use the most expensive materials. For example, colored glass and oilcloth should be selected from foreign goods. For the exterior wall plastering, white cement, which is ten times the price of ordinary cement, is to be mixed into ordinary cement.

The appearance should be novel, and the materials should be expensive, but the purpose of comfort and suitability has not been achieved, which means that the investment effect has not been fully utilized. The following facts can illustrate this problem.

Audience Hall - The place where the audience watches the performance currently accommodates about 1,300 people. But from the overall design area of the theater, it is entirely possible to add some more seats without changing the first floor area and without affecting the audience's sight lines, and there have been more than 800 letters from the masses requesting more seats. According to the requirements of the masses, the construction unit also suggested that the architect reduce the inconvenient boxes on both sides of the theater and extend the middle boxes forward by three meters, which can add about 300 seats, and these are the best seats. However, the designers did not adopt this excellent suggestion, and instead adopted the method of adding side seats with poor sight lines and reducing the size of each seat, only adding 159 very bad seats compared to the original design, which caused an irreparable defect to the theater.

Stage - The front and backstage are the most important places for actors to move around. Here, a series of equipment serving the performance is accommodated - dressing rooms, lighting, scenery, props, etc. But how do the architects serve the performance?

In the dressing room, in order to facilitate the actors to put on and remove makeup, washbasins, wardrobes and dressing tables need to be set up separately. However, the designers concentrated the washbasins that each dressing room should have in one room, and did not consider the design of the wardrobe at all. In addition, the aisle in front of the dressing room is designed to be only 1.69 meters wide, which will be very inconvenient for two Peking Opera actors wearing costumes to walk around. It is completely imaginable that in the future, actors will run to one place to wash their faces and hands, which will definitely be crowded. Shouldn't the architects have thought of this, which will affect the performance?

Looking at the lighting settings, only the most important "side light" and "face light" have not been well handled. "Side light" should be a light that can rotate and move left and right, but the designers have restricted it to the narrow wall hole in front of the stage opening, so that it cannot rotate and move freely according to the needs of the stage. As for the "face light," it is also placed in a very inappropriate position. The reason for this is said to be to avoid destroying the beauty of the ceiling. Everyone knows that the "beauty" of the ceiling does not help the performance much.

If the above shortcomings are due to the designers not having the experience of stage workers, then the responsibility for the following situation cannot be shirked in any way. At the main entrance of the building, there are three gate covers made in the style of drooping flower gates. The doors are already not high, and the drooping flower covers are very low, which is naturally inconvenient for thousands of people to enter and exit. The architect designed it this way, it is said, because raising the door would damage the integrity of the window style on the facade. Entertainment venues are places where mass activities are relatively concentrated. In order to allow the masses to evacuate quickly in the event of any danger, the location of the emergency exit is extremely important. However, the designers of this theater also placed the emergency exit at the east end of the lounge, which not only requires turning but also requires stepping down, which is even more inconvenient to get out of. In case of an accident, the emergency exit will become an uneasy door! Furthermore, the ratio of the audience hall to the lounge is one to three and a half, and the area for rest is obviously too large, which is also a waste. Is it also because of lack of experience! For the sake of personal preferences, the designers often changed the design intentions, seriously wasting design efforts. Some comrades who carried out various specific tasks under his leadership spent several months studying the design of interior decoration, furniture and sculpture models, and were often denied because they did not conform to the architect's preferences, resulting in nothing.

It is undeniable that the theater is a relatively complex design in public buildings. It contains various aspects of knowledge and experience, so it requires designers to cooperate closely with engineers in various equipment aspects and stage workers, listen to their opinions and requirements, and fully consider the audience. However, as shown by many facts above, the designers not only did not do this, but also reversed the architectural principles of "suitable, economical, and beautiful where possible," and even sacrificed all the value of use in order to achieve the so-called "beauty," which is very wrong.

Currently, the Capital Theater has accepted the opinions of all parties and decided to further inspect and modify the original design, which is gratifying. The reason why we have to bring up this design, which is already prepared for modification, again is to use it as a lesson to arouse everyone's vigilance and avoid similar errors in the future.

    厉行节约，反对基本建设中的浪费！
    首都剧场设计中存在的问题
    马浩然
    正在兴建中的首都剧场，是首都规模较大、设备较好的一个新型剧场。原设计是话剧场，后改为可以上演大型歌舞剧的剧场。几年来，由于首都艺术事业的发展，国外许多艺术团体也不断来我国访问，而首都又没有一个规模较大的剧场，因此建设这个剧场是很必要的。
    中央设计院为了把这个剧场设计得更好，曾在内部展开过一次设计竞赛。但是他们不但没有把它设计得更适用、更经济，反而给国家造成巨大的浪费。目前，建筑单位接受了施工单位的意见，决定修改原设计，取消一些不合理的扩建计划，削减一些不必要的装饰和贵重建筑材料，以及减少一部分可能减少的国外订货的设备，就可以给国家节约一百五十多万元。当然，这个剧场原来设计的是话剧场，后来又改为合乎现代演出条件的大型的歌舞剧场，由于设计任务的变化，曾给设计和施工造成一定的困难和浪费。加之要求标准高，对投资使用没有进行监督，这些都是建筑单位要负重大责任的。但同时也有更多的事实可以证明，有许多浪费是由于设计人员不爱护国家财产、一味追求形式上的美观所造成的。
    这个建筑的设计负责人是建筑师林乐义。设计者为了使这个新型剧场“真正达到新的标准”，常常是不依照完整的工作计划和客观条件进行设计，而是凭着主观爱好，标新立异地追求形式。譬如在正门两旁的像华表一样的两个柱灯，设计者偏要用奇特的做法来安一圈灯泡。挂在门厅中顶部藻井中间的一个枝形大吊灯，也被搞成离奇的曲线形状。在休息厅里，设计者毫无道理地为了寻找所谓“木头气味”，准备在平顶粉刷上作木头线脚，但是他没有考虑在钢丝网抹灰平顶上是很难钉牢木头线脚的。设计者还要求在墙面上用“库缎”钉面，这是一种仅次于“锦缎”的布，价钱很贵。当时，建筑师没有想到这点，同时也不考虑粉刷后的墙面潮湿，如果钉“库缎”，还需要以三夹板作衬里。后来幸好没有买到“库缎”，否则将会浪费更多的钱。在使用材料方面，设计者力求一切都要用最贵的。例如花玻璃、漆布都要选用国外货物。在外墙粉刷上，却要在普通水泥中掺入价格十倍于普通水泥的白水泥。
    样子要新奇，材料要贵，但是没有达到舒适、合用的目的，这就是说没有充分发挥投资效果。从以下一些事实就可以说明这个问题。
    观众厅——观众观看演出的地方，目前可容纳的观众约为一千三百人。但从剧场的整个设计面积来看，在不改变其首层面积，并不影响观众视线的情况下，再增加一些座位是完全可能的，而且也曾有八百多封群众来信要求多增加一些座位。修建单位根据群众要求，也曾建议建筑师把目前的两侧看剧不方便的楼座减少，将中间的楼座向前延伸三公尺，就可增加约三百个座位，并且是最好的座位。但设计者并未采纳这个极好的建议，采取了增加视线不好的边座，和缩小每一个座位尺寸的办法，只比原设计增加了一百五十九个很不好的座位，给这个剧场造成了不可弥补的缺陷。
    舞台——前台和后台，是演员最主要的活动地方。在这里容纳所有为演出而服务的一系列的设备——化装室、灯光、布景、道具等。而建筑师是怎样为演出服务的呢？
    在化装室里，为了演员化装卸装方便，需要分别设置洗手盆、壁橱和化装台。但设计者却把每间化装室应有的洗手盆集中在一间房子里，而对壁橱的设计则根本没有考虑。另外把化装室前面的走道设计得只有一点六九公尺宽，只要两个穿上戏装的京剧演员行走起来，就会非常不便。完全可以想像，将来演员上下装都跑到一个地方去洗脸洗手，一定很拥挤，这是不是会影响演出呢，建筑师是完全应该想到这点的。
    再看灯光设置，仅以最主要的“侧光”和“面光”来说，就没有得到很好的处理。“侧光”应该是一个可以左右旋转移动的灯光，但是设计者却把它限制在台口前面的狭窄墙洞之内，使它不能根据舞台上的需要而自由旋转和移动。至于“面光”也同样安置在很不适当的位置。其所以要这样作，据说是怕破坏了天花顶的美丽。大家知道，天花顶的“美丽”对演出的帮助是不大的。
    如果说以上的缺点是由于设计者没有舞台工作者的体验，那么对下面的情况就无论如何也不能推卸责任了。在建筑物的主要入口处，有三个作成垂花门式样的门罩，门已经不算高了，而垂花罩又很低，成千成百的人出入自然不便。建筑师所以这样设计，据说是因为把门伸高了会损害立面上窗户风格的完整。娱乐场所是群众活动比较集中的地方，为了在一旦发生任何危险时，群众能迅速地疏散，太平门的位置是极其重要的。但这个剧场的设计者同样只是为了侧立面的完整，而把太平门安置在休息厅的东端一个不仅需要拐弯、而且还得下踏步的地方，出走时更不方便，一旦有事，太平门会变成不太平的门了！再如，观众厅和休息厅的比例是一比三点五，休息用的面积显然是太大了，这同样是一种浪费，难道也是因为无经验吗！设计者为了个人的喜爱，经常变更设计意图，严重地浪费了设计力量，在他领导下进行各项具体工作的同志，有的花了几个月的时间研究室内装饰、家具和雕塑模型的设计，因不合建筑师所好，常被否定，结果一无所获。
    不可否认，剧场在公共建筑物中是一项比较复杂的设计。它包含着各个方面的学识和经验，因此就需要设计者同各种设备方面的工程师、舞台工作者密切合作，听取他们的意见和要求，并且要充分为观众设想。但是，正如前面许多事实所表现出来的，设计者不但没有这样做，反而将“适用、经济、在可能条件下求美观”的建筑原则本末倒置，甚至为了达到所谓“美”而牺牲一切使用上的价值，这是非常错误的。
    目前，首都剧场已接受各方面的意见，决定进一步检查和修改原设计，这是可喜的。我们所以要把这已经准备修改的设计再提出来，是为了把它当作一个教训来引起大家的警惕，避免以后再犯类似错误。
