(Report from this newspaper) Following the statements made by Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Shen Junru, Acting Chairman of the China Democratic League, and the spokesperson of the China Democratic National Construction Association regarding the assassination of staff members of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference by American-Chiang secret service agencies, Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Peng Zemin, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi公Party, Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, responsible persons of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Zhang Yun, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Chen Shutong, Director of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, issued written statements respectively, protesting the crimes of the American-Chiang secret service in murdering staff members of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference and Chinese and foreign journalists, and expressing deep condolences to the martyred heroes.

Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said: We express our utmost anger at the heinous crimes of the American-Chiang secret service. We express our deep condolences for the tragic death of the eleven martyrs including Shi Zhiang. American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang have long been scheming to undermine the Asian-African Conference and have been carrying out a series of conspiracies. This premeditated murder of personnel of our delegation is part of its entire conspiracy. We firmly support the solemn statement of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, demanding that the British government and the Hong Kong authorities conduct a thorough investigation into this incident and bring the criminals involved in this conspiracy and assassination to justice.

Peng Zemin, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said: The assassination of personnel of our delegation to the Asian-African Conference by American-Chiang secret service agencies is the most blatant manifestation of the aggression-prone American imperialists' hostility towards the Chinese people and their open sabotage of the Asian-African Conference, which aims to maintain peace and oppose colonialism. We express our utmost anger at this despicable and shameless criminal act. On behalf of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, I fully support the solemn statement of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding this assassination. I represent the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in extending our deep condolences and heartfelt sympathy to the families of the victims.

Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi公Party, said: American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique fear the convening of the Asian-African Conference and do not hesitate to use the despicable means of murdering personnel of our delegation to achieve the purpose of undermining the conference. This once again proves that the American warmongers and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique are the mortal enemies of the peace-loving people of Asia, Africa, and the world. The British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong must take swift measures to thoroughly investigate this incident and arrest and bring the criminals to justice as soon as possible.

Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, said: The purpose of the Asian-African Conference is to promote friendship and cooperation between Asian and African countries and to enhance friendly and good-neighborly relations. This purpose is incompatible with the war policy and colonial policy of American imperialism. Therefore, the murder of staff members and journalists of our delegation to the Asian-African Conference by American-Chiang secret agents is not only a crazy manifestation of hostility towards the People's Republic of China, but also a heinous sabotage of the Asian-African Conference. On the eve of the conference, facing this despicable assassination by American-Chiang secret agents, we should transform grief and indignation into strength, strive for the victory and success of the conference, and fight to the end for Asian and world peace!

A responsible person of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions said: The assassination of personnel of our delegation by American and Chiang Kai-shek secret service agencies once again exposes their criminal face of undermining all undertakings conducive to international peace and cooperation, and exposes their fear of establishing and enhancing friendly and good-neighborly relations between Asian and African countries. This is not only a hostile act against the Chinese people, but also a hostile act against all countries participating in the Asian-African Conference. The Chinese working class and the people of the whole country express their utmost anger at the utterly shameless crimes of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. We express our deep sorrow for the unfortunate fate of the martyrs. The Chinese working class and the people of the whole country firmly support the Chinese delegation's participation in the Asian-African Conference and will work with delegations from various countries to contribute to the peace of the Far East and the world.

Zhang Yun, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, said: On behalf of all Chinese women, I express my utmost indignation at this despicable crime committed by American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. This act of murder only further exposes the brutal and shameless face of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and exposes their hostility to the Asian-African Conference where Asian and African people seek peace and friendship. This is not only an attack on the Asian and African people, but also an attack on world peace. Our women of the whole country fully support the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and demand that the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong conduct a thorough investigation and arrest and bring to justice the criminals involved in this conspiracy and assassination.

Chen Shutong, Director of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: No conspiracy by American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique can prevent the successful convening of the Asian-African Conference. On the contrary, it will further increase the indignation of the Asian-African countries and the peace-loving people of the world. Our industrialists and businessmen of the whole country, together with the people of the whole country, fully support the Chinese delegation headed by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai to participate in the Asian-African Conference, and we must resolutely counter all the conspiracies and sabotage of the American-Chiang secret agents, so that the just cause of peace will be victorious.

Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, said: American imperialism is extremely hostile to the Asian-African Conference. It attempts to threaten the Chinese people and sabotage the Asian-African Conference by means of despicable murder. However, this vulgar practice is doomed to be futile. The Chinese people who have stood up and the awakened Asian and African people will never be intimidated by the shameful conspiracies of American imperialism. On the contrary, this barbaric act of murder can only make the Chinese people, the Asian and African people, and the peace-loving people of the world hate the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism even more, and strengthen their determination to oppose American aggression and defend world peace.

    各民主党派和人民团体负责人发表谈话
    深悼死难烈士痛斥美蒋罪行
    本报讯　在中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深、中国民主同盟代主席沈钧儒和中国民主建国会发言人就美蒋特务机关谋杀我国参加亚非会议的代表团工作人员事件发表谈话后，中国民主促进会主席马叙伦、中国农工民主党副主席彭泽民、中国致公党主席陈其尤、九三学社中央委员会主席许德珩、中华全国总工会负责人、中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席章蕴和中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通、中国人民外交学会会长张奚若，分别发表书面谈话，抗议美蒋特务谋杀我国参加亚非会议的代表团工作人员和中外记者的罪行，并对被难烈士表示沉痛悼念。
    中国民主促进会主席马叙伦说：我们对于美蒋特务的万恶罪行，表示切齿的愤怒。对石志昂等十一位烈士的罹难表示深切哀悼。美帝国主义和蒋匪帮早就处心积虑要破坏亚非会议，并且进行着一系列的阴谋活动，这次预谋杀害我国代表团人员的事件正是它的整个阴谋活动的一部分。我们坚决拥护我国外交部的严正声明，要求英国政府和香港当局对这一事件进行彻底查究，把参与这一阴谋暗害事件的罪犯逮捕法办。
    中国农工民主党副主席彭泽民说：美蒋特务机关谋杀我国出席亚非会议代表团人员的事件，是侵略成性的美帝国主义者敌视中国人民，公然破坏旨在维护和平、反对殖民主义的亚非会议的最露骨的表现。我们对这种卑鄙无耻的罪恶行为，表示无比的愤怒。我代表中国农工民主党完全拥护我国外交部对这次谋杀事件的严正声明。我代表农工民主党向遇害者的家属致以沉痛的吊唁和深切的慰问。
    中国致公党主席陈其尤说：美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团害怕亚非会议的召开，竟不惜用谋杀我代表团人员的卑劣手段来达到破坏会议的目的。这就再一次证实了美国好战分子和蒋介石卖国集团是亚洲、非洲和全世界爱好和平人民的死敌。英国政府和香港英国当局必须迅速采取措施，彻底查究这次事件，将罪犯们早日逮捕法办。
    九三学社中央委员会主席许德珩说：亚非会议的目的是促进亚非各国之间的亲善和合作，增进友好睦邻关系。这一目的和美帝国主义的战争政策和殖民政策是不能相容的。因此，美蒋特务对我国出席亚非会议代表团工作人员及记者的谋杀，不仅是敌视中华人民共和国的疯狂的表现，而且是对亚非会议的凶恶的破坏。当会议召开前夕，面对着美蒋特务这一卑鄙的暗杀行为，我们应化悲愤为力量，争取会议的胜利成功，为亚洲和世界和平而奋斗到底！
    中华全国总工会负责人说：美国和蒋匪特务机关谋杀我国代表团人员事件，再一次暴露了他们破坏一切有利于国际和平合作事业的罪恶面貌，暴露了他们对于亚洲非洲各国之间建立和增进友好睦邻关系的恐惧。这不仅是对中国人民的敌对行为，而且也是对一切参加亚非会议的国家的敌对行为。中国工人阶级和全国人民对于美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮这种无耻透顶的罪行表示万分愤怒。对于殉难者的不幸遭遇深表悲痛。中国工人阶级和全国人民坚决拥护中国代表团参加亚非会议，和各国代表团一起为远东和世界和平作出贡献。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席章蕴说：我代表全中国妇女对美帝国主义和蒋匪帮所作的这一卑鄙罪行表示万分的愤慨。这种谋杀行为，只是更加暴露美帝国主义和蒋匪帮的凶残无耻的面目，暴露他们对亚非人民谋求和平友好的亚非会议的敌视。这不仅是他们对亚非人民的进攻，而且是对世界和平的进攻。我们全国妇女完全支持外交部的声明，要求英国政府和香港英国当局彻底查究，把这一阴谋暗害事件的罪犯逮捕法办。
    中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通说：美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团的任何阴谋都不能阻挠亚非会议的胜利召开，相反地将更增加亚非国家和全世界爱好和平的人民的愤慨。我们全国工商业者和全国人民一道，全力支持以周恩来总理兼外长为首的中国代表团参加亚非会议，并一定要给美蒋特务的一切阴谋破坏以坚决的回击，使正义的和平事业获得胜利。
    中国人民外交学会会长张奚若说：美帝国主义是极端仇视亚非会议的，它企图以谋杀的卑鄙手段来对中国人民进行威胁，对亚非会议进行破坏。但是，这种下流的作法必定是徒劳的。已经站起来了的中国人民和觉醒了的亚非人民，决不会被美帝国主义的可耻阴谋所吓倒；相反的，这种野蛮的谋杀行为只能使中国人民、亚非人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民对美帝国主义的侵略阴谋更加憎恨，并增强反对美国侵略、保卫世界和平的决心。
