    Jiangsu's Trial Spinning of Harvested Immature Cotton Bolls Yields Good Results
    Some cotton textile factories in Jiangsu Province have achieved good results in trial spinning cotton harvested from immature bolls. This cotton, manually harvested from unripe cotton bolls damaged by floods, has high moisture content, short fibers, poor strength, and many impurities, easily affecting the quality of cotton yarn. At the beginning of the trial spinning, factories like Changzhou Xinyi, Dacheng No. 1 Factory, and No. 3 Factory all educated workers about the significance of using harvested immature cotton bolls, boosting their confidence in the trial. Workers said: Harvested immature cotton bolls are the victorious fruits of the farmers' struggle against the flood; we must spin them into high-quality yarn. The factories also organized and held technical research meetings, encouraging everyone to find ways to overcome difficulties. During the trial spinning at Changzhou Dacheng No. 1 Factory, technicians devised methods to properly dry the harvested immature cotton bolls. Dacheng No. 1 and No. 3 factories installed trays in appropriate positions on the carding machines, improving the impurity removal efficiency of the cotton cleaning machines. In addition, they also optimized the drafting ratio of the roving and spinning frames, reducing the breakage rate and improving uniformity. Workers participating in the trial spinning also paid close attention to operation and cleaning. Larger textile factories in Wuxi and other places, such as Shenxin No. 3 Factory, Qingfeng, and Zhenxin, also added cotton drying equipment. Other smaller yarn factories, without adding equipment, created many cotton drying methods, maintaining the quality of cotton yarn. After trial spinning at Changzhou Dacheng No. 3 Factory, not only was the strength maintained at the previous level, but also the number of cotton neps was reduced.

    江苏试纺剥桃棉情况良好
    江苏省部分棉纺织厂试用剥桃棉情况良好。剥桃棉是用人工从遭受水害未成熟的棉桃中剥出来的，它所含水分高，短纤维多，强力差，杂质多，很容易影响棉纺质量。常州新毅、大成一厂和三厂等在试纺开始时，都向工人进行了使用剥桃棉意义的教育，提高了工人试纺信心。工人们说：剥桃棉是农民兄弟和水灾斗争的胜利果实，我们一定要把它纺出好纱来。各厂还组织和召开了技术研究会议，发动大家想办法克服困难。常州大成一厂在试纺中，技术人员设法把剥桃棉进行适当的烘干；大成一、三厂都在梳棉机的适当位置上装上托板，提高了清棉机除杂效率。另外，他们还克服了粗纱和细纱的牵伸倍数，降低断头率，提高均匀度。参加试纺的工人也十分注意操作和做好清洁工作。无锡等地申新三厂、庆丰、振新等较大的纺织厂还增添了烘棉机设备，其他较小的纱厂在不增加设备的条件下，创造了不少烘棉办法，保持了棉纱质量。常州大成三厂试纺后，不但强力保持过去的水平，棉结也减少了。（本报驻南京记者）
