Xinhua News Agency, Manila, April 26th: Immediately after the conclusion of the Asian-African Conference, military representatives of the Manila Treaty Organization countries, led by the United States, held a secret meeting in Baguio, Philippines, on the 25th. They were drafting military plans, as decided in Bangkok in February, to advance war preparations in Asia.

Western news agency reports indicate that the main purpose of the meeting convened by the United States was to plan the establishment of a Manila Treaty Organization military force, making it a tool for U.S. aggression in Asia. Sources revealed that the military representatives attending the meeting would discuss establishing a so-called mobile strike force "capable of being mobilized at any time" for the U.S. to order around. The meeting will focus on planning the establishment of a mobile air force unit and "modernizing" the airfields of these countries so that the United States can quickly turn them into air bases when launching new aggressions.

The sources said that the United States would demand that other countries "contribute" to the Manila Treaty Organization's mobile force in terms of manpower and resources, serving the U.S. policy of aggression in Asia. It was revealed that the troops the United States would request from each country would include: ground forces, air force, navy, and auxiliary troops in logistics, transportation, and intelligence. To facilitate direct control over these troops, the United States will also request the establishment of a liaison group at the meeting to manage and allocate the training plans for these troops.

The sources said that the military representatives attending the meeting will "stipulate clear guidelines" to deal with so-called "subversive activities," which means to deal with the peaceful and democratic activities of the people in Southeast Asian countries who oppose colonialism and the imperialist war policy. The United States also plans to establish a so-called regional intelligence center to uniformly deploy espionage and sabotage activities against Southeast Asian countries.

Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: TASS, New York, April 26th: According to a United Press reporter stationed in the Philippines, the military representatives of the eight countries of the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc continued to hold an extremely secret meeting in Baguio on the 26th.

According to the reporter, the meeting discussed the issue of the Philippines, Thailand, and Pakistan providing land forces to the so-called "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Joint Armed Forces." The United States announced that it was prepared to provide a "mobile air force unit."

The meeting also discussed the establishment of a so-called "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Armed Forces Joint Command."
