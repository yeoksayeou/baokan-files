Announcement of Memorial Service for Martyrs Shi Zhiang, Li Zhaoji, Zhong Buyun, Shen Jiantu, Huang Zuomei, Du Hong, Li Ping, Hao Fengge, Wang Mingfang, Starletz, and Ernst Friedrich
    Announcement of the Preparatory Committee for the Memorial Service for Martyrs Shi Zhiang et al.
    Comrades Shi Zhiang, Li Zhaoji, and Zhong Buyun, staff members of the Delegation of the People's Republic of China to the Asian-African Conference; reporters Shen Jiantu, Huang Zuomei, Du Hong, Li Ping, and Hao Fengge; Comrade Wang Mingfang, staff member of the Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; Polish reporter Starletz; and Austrian reporter Ernst Friedrich, were on board the Indian International Airways Constellation "Kashmir Princess" aircraft chartered by the delegation. The plane departed from Hong Kong at 12:11 PM (Beijing time) on April 11th, bound for Jakarta and then Bandung. Due to premeditated sabotage by US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, the aircraft exploded and caught fire while flying over the sea near Stanau Island in the Da Natuna Islands of Indonesia, crashing into the sea. All eleven martyrs, including Shi Zhiang, were killed. The deliberate sabotage of the Asian-African Conference by US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, resorting to despicable means of murder, has aroused universal indignation. We are deeply saddened by the tragic death of the martyrs like Shi Zhiang, who strived for the cause of peace. The memorial service for the martyrs Shi Zhiang et al. is scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM on April 17th at the Sun Yat-sen Park Music Hall. This announcement is hereby made.
    Preparatory Committee for the Memorial Service for Martyrs Shi Zhiang et al.
