    The Chinese people express their heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet government, the Soviet Communist Party, and the Soviet people for the great, comprehensive, and selfless assistance they have given us in our socialist construction.

    We sincerely wish the Soviet trade unions further achievements in organizing and carrying out socialist competitions to strive for the completion and overfulfillment of national economic plans, and we wish the Soviet people new achievements in the cause of striving for the early completion of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, and victory in the struggle to maintain European collective security and defend world peace.

    Long live the unbreakable friendship and cooperation between the people of the Soviet Union and China—a powerful factor for world peace!
