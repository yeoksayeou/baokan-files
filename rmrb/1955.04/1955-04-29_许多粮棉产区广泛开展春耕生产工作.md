    Spring agricultural production has been widely launched in the Huai River basin, the Yellow River basin, and the northern border regions. Currently, spring wheat has been largely sown in Hebei, Shanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Rehe, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Except for Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces, various regions are sowing or have already sown miscellaneous grains such as corn, sorghum, millet, and sweet potatoes, as well as oil crops such as peanuts, flax, castor beans, and sunflowers. Cotton in Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Xinjiang and other provinces has begun to be sown successively, and some areas have already completed sowing.

    Due to the further development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the in-depth publicity of the "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" measures for grain, the production enthusiasm of farmers in various regions has significantly increased. Although there were multiple snowfalls last winter and the soil moisture content is good this spring, farmers in many areas still paid attention to water conservancy construction and soil moisture conservation based on the pattern of rainfall shortage in previous springs. To ensure the universal increase in the production of grain, cotton, and oil, various regions, in addition to actively promoting technologies such as selecting improved varieties, deep plowing and close planting, rational fertilization, and prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Rehe, Liaoning, Heilongjiang and other provinces also advocate expanding the planting area of high-yield crops such as corn, sweet potatoes, and rice, and promoting intercropping, mixed cropping, and other methods of rationally utilizing land. Farmers in Hebei Province are preparing to plant 2.8 million mu of corn, sweet potatoes, rice, etc., which is estimated to increase grain production by 300 million jin. Rehe Province plans to expand corn and sweet potatoes to more than 1.17 million mu, of which corn is expected to exceed 1.05 million mu. Heilongjiang Province plans to expand corn by more than 3 million mu and rice by more than 360,000 mu; the expansion of corn alone can increase grain production by 300 to 400 million jin. The Jinan Special District of Shanxi Province has formulated a preliminary plan for multiple cropping of wheat fields and crop rotation of cotton fields in the next few years to further increase grain and cotton production. This year, the Jinan Special District plans to replant 560,000 mu of corn, sweet potatoes, millet, etc. after the wheat harvest, an increase of 28 percent over last year, which is estimated to increase grain production by 111 million jin. In addition to appropriately expanding the cotton planting area, cotton-producing provinces are focusing on increasing the yield per unit area of cotton fields. Shandong Province implements zoned technical guidance based on the characteristics of various cotton-producing areas. The cotton-producing areas of Henan Province universally carry out technical instruction, especially in new cotton areas, improved variety cotton areas, and low-yield cotton areas. Under the guidance of agricultural technology promotion stations in cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province, many farmers have learned the techniques of seed selection, sunning, soaking, and drought-resistant sowing to strive for full seedling emergence in cotton fields. Farmers in various regions are also actively expanding the planting area of oil crops and improving the cultivation techniques of oil crops without affecting the increase in grain and cotton production. This year, the state has promoted new animal-powered farm implements such as double-wheeled double-bottom plows to farmers in the above-mentioned areas, promoted improved varieties, supplied chemical fertilizers and pest control machinery and equipment, and issued agricultural production loans, which have powerfully promoted spring agricultural production.

### 许多粮棉产区广泛开展春耕生产工作

    许多粮棉产区广泛开展春耕生产工作
    春耕生产已经在淮河流域、黄河流域和北方边疆地区广泛开展起来。目前，河北、山西、甘肃、青海、新疆、热河、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江等省和内蒙古自治区的春小麦已大体种完；除辽宁、吉林、黑龙江三省外，各地正在播种或已经种完玉米、高粱、谷子、薯类等杂粮作物和花生、胡麻、蓖麻、向日葵等油料作物；江苏、山东、河南、河北、山西、陕西、新疆等省的棉花已先后开始播种，有些地区并已种完。
    由于互助合作运动进一步发展，和深入宣传了粮食“定产、定购、定销”的措施后，各地农民生产情绪显著提高。虽然去冬多次降雪，今春土地墒情较好，但是许多地区的农民仍根据历年春季缺雨的规律，注意了兴修水利和耕耙保墒。为保证粮食、棉花、油料普遍增产，各地除纷纷推行选用良种、深耕密植、合理施肥、防治病虫害等技术外，江苏、山东、河北、山西、热河、辽宁、黑龙江等省还提倡扩大玉米、薯类、稻子等高产作物的种植面积，并推广间作、套种等合理利用土地的办法。河北省农民准备种植玉米、薯类、稻子等二百八十万亩，估计可增产粮食三亿斤。热河省计划把玉米、薯类扩大到一百十七万多亩，其中玉米一百零五万亩预计可以超额完成。黑龙江省计划扩大玉米三百多万亩，水稻三十六万多亩；仅扩大玉米一项就可以增产粮食三、四亿斤。山西省晋南专区已制定出今后几年麦田复种和棉田轮作的初步规划，以进一步增产粮食和棉花。今年晋南专区计划在麦收后复种玉米、甘薯、谷子等五十六万亩，比去年扩大百分之二十八，估计可增产粮食一亿一千一百万斤。各产棉省份除适当扩大棉花的种植面积外，都着重提高棉田的单位面积产量。山东省针对各产棉地区的特点，实行分区技术指导。河南省各产棉地区普遍开展技术传授，特别是新棉区、良种棉区和棉花低产区。河北省产棉地区在农业技术推广站指导下，许多农民学习了选种、晒种、浸种以及抗旱播种的技术，争取棉田全苗。各地农民还在不影响粮、棉增产的条件下，积极扩大油料作物的种植面积，改进油料作物的栽培技术。今年国家在上述地区向农民推广双轮双铧犁等新式畜力农具、推广良种、供应化学肥料和治虫药械、发放农业生产贷款等，有力地推动了春耕生产。　　　　　　（新华社）
