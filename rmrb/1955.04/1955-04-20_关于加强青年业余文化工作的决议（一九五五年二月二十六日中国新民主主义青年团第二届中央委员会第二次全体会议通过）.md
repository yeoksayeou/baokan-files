    I. The socialist construction and socialist transformation of our country are developing vigorously. In order to victoriously develop our country's socialist construction, the Party and the State require the younger generation not only to have a high degree of political consciousness, but also to become people with rich cultural and scientific knowledge, strong physiques, and noble morals. At the same time, with the development of the country's politics and economy and the gradual improvement of people's lives, the vast number of young people have increasingly strong demands for cultural life, and urgently require organizing amateur learning and participating in various lively and varied cultural and sports activities. Carrying out amateur cultural activities not only helps to raise the socialist awareness of young people, inspire their labor enthusiasm, inspire their creative abilities, enhance their physical and mental health, and cultivate new moral qualities in young people; but also enables the League organization to more widely connect with the youth masses, understand the youth situation, listen to youth opinions, discover active youth elements, and improve the work of the League in this connection. The Youth League should fully recognize that mass cultural work is an important component of communist education for young people, and must regard it as an important and regular task.
    II. Since the Second National Congress of the Youth League, the League organizations at all levels, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions of "good health, good study, and good work," have actively advocated and organized young people to carry out amateur cultural activities. Facts have proved that in places where youth amateur cultural activities are carried out well, the enthusiasm of young people for learning and labor has increased, young people appear more vigorous, and the connection between the Youth League organization and the vast number of young people is closer. However, on the whole, the current youth amateur cultural work is still far behind the needs of the masses, and the mass cultural activities of many grass-roots organizations have not been widely carried out. Even in places where some activities have already been carried out, there are still shortcomings such as infrequent activities, unrich content, undiverse forms, and unextensive participation of members. One of the important reasons for the above shortcomings is that the League cadres lack sufficient understanding of this work and lack experience and methods. Some cadres oppose production and cultural activities, believing that engaging in amateur cultural activities will "hinder the central work"; others emphasize difficulties such as "lack of time," "poor equipment," and "insufficient strength." In addition, some League organizations are not good at using existing cultural facilities and social forces to carry out mass cultural work. Because many League organizations have not made efforts to meet the cultural needs of young people and guide them to make progress, the bourgeoisie and various bad elements have taken advantage of this opportunity to lure and corrupt young people by various means, so that young people in many places pursue improper pastimes in their spare time, develop bad habits, affect their physical and mental health, and also hinder work, production, and learning. In order to overcome the above shortcomings and further strengthen communist education for the vast number of young people, the Central Committee of the Youth League requires League organizations at all levels throughout the country to comprehensively care for young people, gradually meet their demands, and further widely carry out youth amateur cultural work.
    III. Based on the practical experience of the Youth League's work in recent years and the creativity of the masses, the Central Committee of the Youth League believes that the focus of carrying out amateur cultural work among young people in the future should be on the following aspects:
    (1) Eliminating illiteracy among the young masses and improving the cultural, scientific, and technological level of young people.
    Among the workers and peasant youth in our country, there are still about 70% illiterates and semi-illiterates, and among the League members, there are still about 50%. The League organizations at all levels must take various measures to implement the instructions of the Party and the People's Government on eliminating illiteracy among the masses, and actively carry out literacy work among young people. Youth League members should take the lead in learning to read and write and constantly improve their cultural level.
    Various amateur learning organizations such as people's schools, winter schools, youth learning groups in rural areas, and amateur cultural schools in factories are important fronts for the vast number of young people to acquire cultural and scientific knowledge. The League organization should strengthen the ideological and organizational work in these learning organizations; recommend League members with culture to serve as teachers or "little teachers", care for the learning and work of teachers; and actively assist the government and trade unions in convening representative meetings of outstanding students or teachers. If agricultural production cooperatives have the conditions to establish people's schools, the League organization should actively advocate and support them.
    According to the needs of industrial and agricultural production development and the urgent demands of industrial and agricultural youth, the Youth League organization must earnestly care about the technical learning of industrial and agricultural youth, widely mobilize young people to learn while doing, actively participate in amateur technical schools, technical training classes, and technical research groups and other learning organizations, organize young workers to learn from Soviet advanced experience and sign apprenticeship contracts with skilled adult workers, and help young farmers sign teaching contracts with agricultural technology extension stations, in order to improve the technical level of young people.
    The League organization should strengthen cooperation with the Science and Technology Popularization Association, hold science lectures and exhibitions of pictures and models in a planned way to educate young people on scientific knowledge, recommend science education films and popular science and technology reading materials, enrich the content of scientific knowledge in amateur cultural learning, and regularly care about the situation of young people learning scientific and technological knowledge.
    The League organization should pay attention to the learning problems of junior and senior high school graduates who have not gone on to higher education and young people with elementary cultural levels, and attract them to participate in various learning organizations suitable for their level according to their interests and needs, in order to continuously consolidate and improve their cultural and scientific knowledge level.
    (2) Organizing and guiding young people to read books and newspapers.
    The League organization should strengthen contact and cooperation with libraries, help expand reading rooms in factories, mines, government agencies, schools and collective dormitories, assist cultural centers and stations in establishing rural libraries and mobile book boxes, improve library management work, recommend outstanding League members to serve as librarians, and regularly care for the purchase of new books that are loved by young people. Widely carry out book publicity, do a good job in reading guidance, educate young people to study diligently and ask questions, organize collective reading, storytelling sessions, reading seminars, lectures, meetings between readers and scientists and writers, and other activities to improve young people's reading ability, in order to expand the educational effect of books. "China Youth Daily," "China Youth," and other League newspapers and periodicals should regard guiding youth reading and introducing excellent reading materials as their regular and important responsibility. China Youth Publishing House should regard supplying youth with popular reading materials as one of its basic tasks, plan to publish popular reading materials and self-study series necessary for young people, and should also work with relevant parties to gradually solve the problem of publishing popular books and periodicals for young people of ethnic minorities. League organizations at all levels should assist Xinhua Bookstore and the post office in doing a good job in supplying and distributing popular books and periodicals.
    (3) Carrying out amateur art activities.
    The League organization should establish, expand, and consolidate various amateur art organizations according to the requirements and possible conditions of young people, give play to the backbone role of League members in amateur art organizations, strengthen the political and ideological leadership of amateur art organizations, pay attention to cultivating and using members in amateur art organizations, so that they become the backbone of carrying out and promoting mass activities.
    The League organization should actively participate in the leadership of clubs, enrich the activities of the clubs, regularly assist in carrying out simple, small-scale and diverse art activities, and also pay attention to the work of collective dormitories and workshop clubs. Where conditions permit, rural League organizations should advocate the establishment of rural clubs, or take the farmers' amateur learning organization as the center to carry out regular singing, dancing, drama and other folk art activities loved by the masses. Provincial and municipal League committees can cooperate with relevant parties to organize art performances on the basis of regular grass-roots activities with preparation, which is an effective way to promote, guide, and improve grass-roots art activities.
    To carry out mass amateur art activities, it is necessary to rely on and cultivate activists among the masses. The League organization should assist relevant parties in using spare time to train these activists in a planned way, and use them to carry out grass-roots cultural activities. In rural areas, special attention should be paid to using the strength of primary school teachers and folk artists. The League organization should pay attention to using films to educate young people, strengthen contact and cooperation with film distribution companies, do a good job in film publicity and recommendation, organize young people to watch and discuss good films, and hold meetings between young people and directors and actors when possible. Rural League organizations should always pay attention to the route of film mobile projection teams going to the countryside, and assist them in doing a good job in publicity and explanation.
    (4) Carrying out sports activities to enhance youth physique.
    The League organization should widely publicize the significance of sports activities, and actively organize young people to participate in various sports activities. Promote broadcast gymnastics in factories, mines, and government agencies, establish regular sports exercise groups and various sports organizations such as ball games, track and field, and apparatus gymnastics; in secondary schools and above, assist the administration in promoting the "Labor and Defense System" and other sports activities in a planned way; in rural areas, advocate and organize sports activities familiar and loved by militiamen and young people; in large and medium-sized cities, cooperate with relevant parties to vigorously carry out various military sports activities such as shooting, marching, aviation models, military camping, and motorcycles among organized youth, in order to strengthen youth national defense education. The League organization should actively help the establishment of mass sports association organizations in various industrial systems, and encourage young people to actively participate in the activities of sports associations, and fully use all sports venues to make them the center of sports activities, and can also organize amateur public welfare labor to open up activity venues and improve sports equipment. The League organization should also work with relevant parties to regularly hold various sports competitions and demonstration performances, discover and cultivate sports activists to promote mass sports activities. The League organization should educate young people to pay attention to hygiene, develop personal hygiene habits, improve environmental hygiene, and mobilize the masses to beautify the environment with their own hands to improve health. IV. In actively carrying out youth mass amateur cultural activities, League organizations at all levels should implement the following principles: First, it is necessary to firmly grasp the principle of amateurism. Various activities should be suitable for the level of the masses, do not aim too high, prevent extravagance and waste, and avoid hindering production, learning and health. Second, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of voluntariness. Because only activities organized according to the needs, interests and characteristics of the masses themselves can be consolidated and developed. Third, the content and methods of activities must be diverse. Only with diverse activities can we achieve the goal of widely organizing the masses to participate in amateur cultural activities and give the masses rich education. In ethnic minority areas, it is also necessary to pay attention to taking care of the characteristics and habits of local ethnic groups to carry out activities. Fourth, it is necessary to pay attention to advocating young people's own creation, and constantly provide practical guidance and assistance from all aspects to continuously improve it.
    V. In carrying out this work, League organizations at all levels should cooperate closely with government cultural, educational, sports departments, trade unions, etc. under the unified leadership of the Party committee, formulate their own plans in accordance with the actual situation, earnestly implement them, and should regularly check the implementation and summarize experience. At the same time, we should also pay attention to organizing the strength of all parties to guide mass cultural activities, encourage scientists, writers, and art workers to write popular books and literary and artistic works on science and technology for young people, care about the growth of young people with literary, artistic, scientific, and sports talents, and support their activities and valuable initiatives.

    关于加强青年业余文化工作的决议
    （一九五五年二月二十六日中国新民主主义青年团第二届中央委员会第二次全体会议通过）
    一、我们国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业正在蓬勃地向前发展。为了胜利地发展我国的社会主义建设事业，党和国家要求年轻一代不但要有高度的政治觉悟，并且要成为具有丰富的文化科学知识、强健的体魄和高尚道德的人。同时，随着国家政治、经济的发展和人民生活的逐步改善，广大青年对文化生活的要求也日益强烈，迫切要求组织业余学习和参加各种生动活泼的文艺体育活动。开展业余文化活动，不仅有助于提高青年的社会主义觉悟，鼓舞青年的劳动热情，启发青年的创造能力，增进青年的身心健康，培养青年新的道德品质；而且能使团的组织更广泛地联系青年群众，在这种联系中了解青年情况，倾听青年意见，发现青年积极分子，和改进团的工作。青年团应当充分认识群众文化工作是对青年进行共产主义教育的一个重要组成部分，必须把它当作自己一项重要的经常的工作去进行。
    二、青年团第二次全国代表大会以后，各级团的组织遵照毛主席“身体好，学习好，工作好”的指示，积极地倡导和组织了青年进行业余文化活动。事实证明：凡是青年业余文化活动开展得好的地方，青年的学习热情和劳动热情就有所增长，青年显得更加朝气蓬勃，青年团的组织和广大青年群众的联系就更加密切。可是总的看来，现在青年业余文化工作还远远落后于群众的需要，不少基层组织的群众文化活动还没有广泛地开展起来，即使已经进行了一些活动的地方，也还存在着活动不经常，内容不丰富，形式不多样，参加成员不广泛等缺点。产生上述缺点的重要原因之一，是这些团的干部对这项工作认识不足，缺少经验和办法。有的干部把生产和文化活动对立起来，认为搞业余文化活动会“妨碍中心工作”；有的强调“时间少”“设备差”“力量不够”等等困难。另外也有些团的组织还不善于运用现有的各种文化设施和社会力量来开展群众文化工作。由于许多团的组织没有努力满足青年的文化需要并引导青年上进，资产阶级和各种坏分子，就乘虚而入，利用各种手段引诱和腐化青年，以至许多地方青年在业余时间追寻不正当的消遣，染上不良习惯，影响了身心健康，也妨碍了工作、生产和学习。为了克服上述缺点，进一步加强广大青年的共产主义教育，青年团中央委员会要求全国各级团的组织应当全面关心青年，逐步满足青年的要求，进一步把青年业余文化工作广泛地开展起来。
    三、根据这几年来青年团工作的实际经验和群众的创造，青年团中央委员会认为今后在青年中开展业余文化工作，应着重以下几个方面：
    （一）扫除青年群众中的文盲，提高青年的文化、科学技术水平。
    在我国工农青年中尚有百分之七十左右、团员中尚有百分之五十左右的文盲和半文盲，各级团的组织要采取各种办法贯彻党和人民政府在群众中扫除文盲的指示，积极在青年中进行扫盲工作。青年团员要带头识字学文化，不断提高自己的文化水平。
    农村中的民校、冬学、青年学习小组和工厂里的业余文化学校等各种业余学习组织，是广大青年获取文化科学知识的重要阵地。团的组织要加强这些学习组织中的思想工作和组织工作；推荐有文化的团员担任教师或小先生，关心教师的学习和工作；主动地协助政府、工会召开优秀学员或教师的代表会。农业生产合作社有条件创办民校的，团的组织应积极加以倡导和支持。
    根据工农业生产发展的需要和工农青年的迫切要求，青年团的组织必须切实关心工农青年的技术学习，广泛发动青年边做边学，积极参加业余技术学校，技术训练班和技术研究小组等学习组织，组织青年工人学习苏联先进经验和有技术的成年工人订立师徒教学合同，帮助青年农民和农业技术推广站订立教学合同，以提高青年的技术水平。
    团的组织要加强与科学技术普及协会的合作，有计划地举办科学讲座和图片、模型展览等向青年进行科学知识的教育，推荐科学教育的电影和通俗的科学技术读物，充实业余文化学习中的科学知识内容，经常关心青年学习科学技术知识的情况。
    团的组织要重视没有升学的初中、小学毕业生和具有初等文化程度的青年的学习问题，吸引他们根据自己的兴趣和需要，参加适合于自己水平的各种学习组织，求得不断地巩固和提高他们的文化科学知识水平。
      （二）组织和指导青年阅读书报。
    团的组织要加强与图书馆的联系和合作，帮助扩大厂矿、机关、学校和集体宿舍的阅览室，协助文化馆、站建立农村图书室和流动图书箱，改进图书管理工作，推荐优秀团员担任图书室管理员，经常关心添购为青年所喜爱的新书。广泛展开图书宣传，做好读书指导工作，教育青年勤学好问，组织集体朗读、故事会、读书座谈会、讲座、读者与科学家和作家见面会等活动，提高青年的阅读能力，以扩大书籍的教育效果。“中国青年报”、“中国青年”及其他团的报刊应把指导青年阅读、介绍优良读物当作自己经常的重要的责任。中国青年出版社应把供应青年通俗读物当作自己的基本任务之一，有计划地出版青年所必需的通俗读物和青年自学丛书，并要会同有关方面，逐步解决供少数民族青年阅读的通俗书刊的出版问题。各级团的组织均应协助新华书店和邮局做好通俗书刊的供应、发行工作。
      （三）开展业余艺术活动。
    团的组织要按照青年的要求和可能条件建立、扩大和巩固各种业余艺术组织，发挥业余艺术组织中团员的骨干作用，加强对业余艺术组织的政治思想领导，注意培养和运用业余艺术组织中的成员，使他们成为开展和推动群众性活动的骨干分子。
    团的组织应积极参加俱乐部的领导，充实俱乐部的活动内容，经常协助开展简便的小型多样的艺术活动，同时还要注意集体宿舍和车间俱乐部的工作。有条件的地方，农村团的组织应倡导建立农村俱乐部，或以农民业余学习组织为中心，开展经常性的歌咏、舞蹈、戏剧及其他为群众所喜爱的民间艺术活动。省市团委可配合有关方面，在经常性的基层活动的基础上，有准备地组织文艺会演，这是推动、指导和提高基层艺术活动的一种有效方法。
    开展群众性的业余艺术活动，必须依靠和培养群众中的积极分子。团的组织应协助有关方面利用业余时间，有计划地训练这些积极分子，运用他们来开展基层的文化活动。在农村中还要特别注意运用小学教师和民间艺人的力量。团的组织要注意运用电影对青年进行教育，加强与电影发行公司的联系和合作，做好电影的宣传和推荐工作，组织青年观看和座谈好的电影，可能时还可以举行青年与导演、演员的见面会。农村团的组织应经常注意电影流动放映队的下乡巡回路线，协助他们做好宣传和解释工作。
    （四）开展体育运动，增强青年体质。团的组织要广泛宣传体育运动的意义，积极组织青年参加各种体育活动。在厂矿、机关中推行广播体操，建立经常性的体育锻炼小组和球类、田径、器械体操等各种运动组织；在中等以上学校应协助行政有计划地推行“劳卫制”及其他体育活动；在农村应倡导和组织民兵和青年群众熟悉和喜爱的体育活动；在大中城市应会同有关方面在有组织的青年中大力开展射击、行军、航空模型、军事野营、摩托车等各种军事体育活动，以加强青年的国防教育。团的组织要积极帮助各产业系统建立群众性的体育协会的组织，并发动青年踊跃参加体育协会的活动，充分运用一切运动场所，使其成为体育活动的中心，同时还可以组织业余公益劳动来开辟活动场地，增修体育设备。团的组织还要会同有关方面，经常举办各种体育运动竞赛和示范表演，发现和培养体育积极分子推动群众性的体育运动。团的组织应教育青年注意卫生，养成个人的卫生习惯，改进环境卫生工作，发动群众自己动手，美化环境，以增进健康。四、在积极开展青年群众业余文化活动中，各级青年团的组织要贯彻下列几项原则：第一，要紧紧掌握业余的原则，各种活动要适合群众水平，不要好高骛远，防止铺张浪费，避免有碍生产、学习和健康。第二，必须坚持自愿的原则。因为只有根据群众本身需要、兴趣和特点自愿参加而组织起来的活动，才能巩固和发展。第三，活动的内容和方式必须多种多样。只有以多种多样的活动，才能达到广泛组织群众参加业余文化活动的目的，并给群众以丰富的教育。在少数民族地区还必须注意照顾当地民族的特点和习惯来开展活动。第四，必须注意提倡青年自己的创造，并经常从各方面给予实际的指导和帮助，使之不断提高。
    五、在开展这一工作中，各级团的组织都应当在党委统一领导下与政府文化、教育、体育部门、工会等方面密切合作，按照实际情况订出自己的计划，认真贯彻，并应经常检查执行情况，总结经验。同时还应注意组织各方面的力量，对群众文化活动进行指导，鼓励科学家、作家和艺术工作者为青年写作科学技术等各种通俗的读物和文学艺术作品，要关怀有文学、艺术、科学、体育才能的青年的成长，并支持他们的活动和有价值的倡议。
