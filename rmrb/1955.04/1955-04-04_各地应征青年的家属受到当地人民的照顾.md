Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd -- Governments and people in various regions across the country are showing concern for and taking care of the families of youths who have enlisted for military service.

    In Henan Province, after the enlistment of youths, various regions have organized慰问 (comfort) groups based on streets, townships, or villages to extend comfort to the families of the enlisted youths. When the 慰问 group of Dapu Township, Eleventh District, Huaxian County, conducted its visits, it discovered that the family of enlisted youth Yu Shizhong was temporarily short of labor. The group organized the masses to help his family deliver manure to the fields in a timely manner. Hou Zeyu, the Civil Affairs Committee member of Yaozhai Township in the Zhengzhou suburban area, led the masses to build a courtyard wall and repair the toilet for Yao Laodun, the family of an enlisted youth. All nine mu of Yao Laodun's land are also being tilled by the nearby agricultural producers' cooperative. Farmers in Tangyin, Nanle, and other counties are actively helping the families of enlisted youths with wheat shoveling, water carrying, and manure delivery. Women are also helping the families of enlisted youths with sewing. In Chongqing, Sichuan Province, citizens hung honorary lights and honorary plaques at the entrances of the homes of enlisted youths. Various districts and townships have successively held symposiums for the families of enlisted youths to understand their difficulties in production and life and actively provide assistance. The Chongqing Municipal Preferential Treatment Committee and relevant departments have also gone deep into districts and townships to actively carry out this work. Many agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams in the Fifth and Sixth Districts warmly welcome and help the families of enlisted youths to join cooperatives and teams with priority. The Xinmin Township People's Committee in Chaoxian County, Anhui Province, also specifically convened a meeting of the families of enlisted youths to plan production. During spring plowing and production, agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams have provided assistance to the families of enlisted youths who lack labor. The families of enlisted youths are very grateful for the care and assistance from the government and the people.

    据新华社二日讯　全国各地政府和人民关怀和照顾应征服兵役的青年的家属。
    河南省各地人民在应征青年入伍后，以街道或乡、村为单位组织慰问小组，向应征青年的家属进行慰问。滑县十一区大铺乡慰问组在进行慰问时，发现应征青年余士中的家庭暂时缺少劳动力，便组织群众帮助他家及时地把粪送到田里。郑州市郊区姚砦乡民政委员侯泽玉领着群众给应征青年的家属姚老囤家打院墙，修厕所。姚老囤家的九亩地也全部由附近的农业生产合作社帮耕。汤阴、南乐等县的农民们纷纷帮助应征青年的家属铲麦、担水、送粪，妇女们还帮助应征青年的家里做针线活。四川省重庆市的市民们在应征青年的家庭的门口挂起了光荣灯和光荣匾。各区、乡都先后召开了应征青年家属座谈会，了解他们在生产、生活上的困难，积极进行帮助。重庆市优抚委员会和有关部门也深入区、乡，积极进行这一工作。五区和六区的许多农业生产合作社和互助组，热情欢迎并帮助应征青年家属优先入社入组。安徽省巢县新民乡人民委员会还专门召开应征青年家属会议筹划生产。各农业生产合作社和互助组在春耕生产时，对劳动力不足的应征青年的家属都进行了帮助。应征青年的家属都非常感激政府和人民的关怀和帮助。
