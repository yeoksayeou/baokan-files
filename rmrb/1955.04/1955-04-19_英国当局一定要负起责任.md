The premeditated murder of eleven martyrs, including Shi Zhiang, by US-Chiang Kai-shek agents has been over a week, yet we have not seen the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong conduct a practical and effective thorough investigation to arrest and bring the murderers to justice. Not only that, but the British government even submitted a memorandum to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 17th, refusing to assume the serious responsibility for this unfortunate incident. This attitude of the British government cannot but make the Chinese people very dissatisfied.

The British government's memorandum cannot allow it to shirk its responsibility for this incident.

Our government had long learned that US-Chiang Kai-shek agents in Hong Kong were planning to sabotage the Indian plane chartered by our delegation. Therefore, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs specifically notified the British Chargé d'Affaires in Beijing at 9:00 a.m. on April 10, requesting the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong to take effective measures to ensure the safety of our delegation's staff and journalists. The British government's memorandum insists that the information provided by our government "did not comment in any way." However, this notification from our government was a formal diplomatic notification. The British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong should have known that upon receiving such a diplomatic notification, they had a responsibility to take necessary and effective measures from all aspects to prevent the sabotage by US-Chiang Kai-shek agents. Anyone knows that it is practically impossible to require our side to "detail" in advance the situation of the sabotage to be carried out by the agents. And this is precisely the issue that the British authorities in Hong Kong had a responsibility to study from various aspects and take corresponding preventive measures.

The British memorandum shows that the British authorities in Hong Kong did not take any preventive measures for more than 24 hours after receiving the warning from our government on the 10th. It was not until around 12:00 noon on the 11th, shortly before the Indian plane was about to arrive in Hong Kong, that the Hong Kong police authorities took so-called "additional preventive measures," and their purpose was merely to "ensure that this group would not be harassed at the airport," and only made general alert for the plane. This shows that after the Chinese government issued a prior warning, the British authorities in Hong Kong did not "take all steps to ensure the safety of passengers and aircraft" as the British memorandum stated.

Facts have proven that the plane crash was the result of premeditated sabotage by US-Chiang Kai-shek agents lurking in Hong Kong. The statement issued by Air India International based on the reports of the three surviving crew members on the crashed plane confirmed that the explosion and fire of the plane "were caused by external causes completely unrelated to the structure of the plane," and "were not caused by any part of the aircraft body or problems with the fuel and other systems of the aircraft." Judging from this statement, it is very clear that the "external cause" that caused the plane to explode and catch fire could only have occurred when the plane was parked in Hong Kong; and this "external cause" could only be the explosives placed somewhere on the plane by US-Chiang Kai-shek agents before the plane took off from Hong Kong. Based on this situation, the British authorities in Hong Kong obviously bear an undeniable responsibility for the plane crash.

The above-mentioned arguments of the people who personally experienced the event prove that the warning issued by our government to the British Chargé d'Affaires in Beijing beforehand and the judgment on the cause of the incident afterwards are completely correct. The British memorandum insists that our government's determination of the cause of the accident was "premature," which is untenable. Our government has every reason to make such a judgment, and it is necessary to expose this crime of the US-Chiang Kai-shek agents to the world in a timely manner. Only the US aggressive bloc and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek clique hope that our country will not expose their conspiracy in a timely manner, so that they can use various shameless lies and slanders to confuse the truth and mislead the public.

The British government's memorandum said that the British authorities in Hong Kong are conducting an investigation. We welcome this statement from the British side. However, it must be pointed out that the direction of the investigation by the British authorities in Hong Kong is not right. We cannot understand why the British authorities in Hong Kong do not seriously investigate in the direction of tracking down the sabotage activities of US-Chiang Kai-shek agents, but instead focus their attention on so-called mechanical failures. At the same time, we cannot understand even more why the British authorities in Hong Kong pay attention to summoning our personnel in Hong Kong and conducting investigations on them, but instead turn a blind eye to the US-Chiang Kai-shek agents in Hong Kong.

The bizarre performance of the British authorities makes the United Press very "interested." The United Press said that the British memorandum accused China of "concealing important intelligence." It also said that the British memorandum "leads people to speculate" whether the Chinese government "may" have "sabotaged the plane" for propaganda purposes. It is very clear that this is the same shameless tune of slandering the Chinese people that the same United Press deliberately spread a few days ago. People want to ask: Could it be that the British side is also interested in this shameless tune in order to shirk its own responsibility?

The British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong must bear serious responsibility for the Indian plane crash. They must conduct a rapid and thorough investigation into this incident. Any delay or prevarication can only allow the US-Chiang Kai-shek agents involved in this murder to escape justice. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people.

    英国当局一定要负起责任
    蒋元椿
    石志昂等十一位烈士被美蒋特务预谋杀害已经过了一个多星期了，人们却还没有看见英国政府和香港英国当局作出切实有效的彻底调查，把凶手逮捕法办。不但如此，英国政府竟在十七日向我国外交部提出备忘录，拒绝承担对这次不幸事件应负的严重责任。英国政府这种态度不能不使中国人民十分不满。
    英国政府的备忘录决不能使它推卸掉对这一事件应负的责任。
    我国政府早就获悉香港美蒋特务分子将对我国代表团包乘的印度飞机进行破坏。因此，我国外交部特在四月十日上午九时将这一情况通知了驻北京的英国代办处，要求英国政府和香港英国当局采取有效措施，以保障我国代表团工作人员和新闻记者的安全。英国政府的备忘录硬说我国政府所提供的消息“并未在任何方面予以评述”。但是我国政府的这一通知是正式的外交通知，英国政府和香港英国当局应该知道在接获这种外交通知以后，它就有责任从各方面采取应有的有效措施，来防止美蒋特务的破坏行为。任何人都知道，要求我国方面事先对特务将要施行破坏的情形予以“详述”，事实上是不可能的。而这正是香港英国当局有责任加以多方面研究并采取相应的预防措施的问题。
    英国的备忘录表明，香港英国当局在十日得到我国政府警告以后，在足足二十四小时以上的时间内，并没有采取什么预防措施。一直到十一日中午十二点钟左右，在印度飞机将要到达香港之前不久，香港的警察当局才采取了所谓“额外的预防措施”，而其目的也仅仅是“保证这一行人不致在机场受到骚扰”，对飞机也只是作了一般的警戒。这说明香港英国当局在中国政府提出了事先的警告之后，并没有像英国备忘录所说那样“采取了一切步骤来确保乘客和飞机的安全”。
    事实已经证明，飞机失事是潜伏在香港的美蒋特务分子预谋破坏的结果。印度国际航空公司根据失事飞机上的三名生还的机务人员的报告所发表的声明，证实这架飞机的爆炸和起火“是由同飞机的结构完全无关的外来的原因造成的”，“并不是由于飞机机体的任何部分或者燃料和飞机的其他系统的毛病造成的”。从这个声明看，很明显，使飞机爆炸起火的“外来的原因”只能够当飞机停留在香港的时候发生；而这个“外来的原因”，只能是美蒋特务在飞机从香港起飞以前在飞机的什么地方安置的爆炸物。根据这个情况，香港英国当局对于飞机失事显然负有绝对不能推卸的责任。
    亲历其事的人们的上述论断，证明了我国政府在事前向英国驻北京代办处提出的警告和事后对这一事件发生的原因的判断是完全正确的。英国备忘录硬说我国政府断定失事原因“过早”，这种说法站不住脚。我国政府有一切根据作这样的判断，并且有必要及时向全世界揭露美蒋特务分子的这一罪行。只有美国侵略集团和它的走狗蒋贼集团才希望我国不及时揭发它们的阴谋，使它们得以用各种无耻的谎言和诬蔑来混乱真相，淆惑视听。
    英国政府的备忘录说，香港英国当局正在进行调查。我们对英国方面的这种表示是欢迎的。但是必须指出，香港英国当局进行调查的方向却不对头。我们不能了解香港英国当局为什么不认真从追查美蒋特务的破坏活动的这个方向来进行调查，却把他们的注意放在所谓机件故障方面。同时，我们更不能了解，香港英国当局为什么注意传讯在香港的我国人员，向他们进行调查，而对于在香港的美蒋特务却反而置之不理。
    英国当局的离奇表现使美国合众社很感“兴趣”。合众社说，英国的备忘录指责中国“隐瞒了重要的情报”。它还说，英国备忘录“使人们猜测”中国政府“是否可能”为了宣传而“破坏这架飞机”。十分明显，这就是同一个合众社几天以前故意散布的对中国人民进行诬蔑的无耻论调。人们要问：难道英国方面为了推卸自己的责任，也会对这种无耻的论调感到兴趣吗？
    英国政府和香港英国当局一定要对于印度飞机失事事件负起严重的责任。它们必须对这一事件进行迅速的、彻底的调查。任何拖延推诿都只能使参与这一谋杀事件的美蒋特务分子漏网。这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。
