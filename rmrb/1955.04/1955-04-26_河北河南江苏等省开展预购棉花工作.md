After the State Council announced the instructions on the pre-purchase of cotton, the People's Committees of Hebei, Henan, Jiangsu, Shandong, Shaanxi and other provinces have made specific arrangements for the pre-purchase of cotton according to the specific conditions of their respective provinces. Now, farmers in cotton-producing areas of Hebei, Henan and other provinces have begun to sign contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives to pre-sell cotton to the state. In early April, more than 100 townships in Wu'an County, Handan Prefecture, a major cotton-producing area in Hebei Province, had signed contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives. According to the contract, these farmers will sell 435,900 dan of new cotton to the state. In Bo'ai County, Henan Province, as of mid-April, 369 agricultural producers' cooperatives and 3 mutual aid teams in six districts had signed pre-purchase contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives. The cotton they pre-sold to the state accounted for 49.6% of the county's cotton pre-purchase plan. Cotton farmers near Guozhen in Lingbao County also sold a large amount of stored cotton to the state when pre-selling cotton. This year, Jiangsu Province plans to pre-purchase more than 2.4 million dan of cotton in 35 counties including Nantong and Sheyang. At present, more than 30,000 cadres from supply and marketing cooperatives in Sheyang, Nanhui, Changshu and other counties have participated in this work.

In order to combine the pre-purchase of cotton with the supply of production and living materials needed by farmers, the relevant financial and economic departments of these provinces are actively carrying out material transfer work. The Shaanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has transferred more than 45,000 tons of chemical fertilizers and more than 20,000 jin of pesticides for seed mixing to major cotton-producing and semi-cotton-producing areas, and is preparing to give priority to transferring a large amount of cake fertilizer to cotton-producing areas. The Jiangsu Provincial Company of China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation and the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau have long prepared special cloth purchase certificates for farmers to buy a total of 2.7 million chi of cloth and more than 20 million jin of grain. The Shandong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has transported more than 110 million jin of cake fertilizer and more than 17 million jin of chemical fertilizer to grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in cotton-producing areas. The provincial grain department and cotton yarn and cloth company are also transferring and storing 24 million jin of grain and 240,000 bolts of cotton cloth that are planned to be supplied to cotton farmers during the cotton pre-purchase period.

To do a good job in the pre-purchase of cotton and help farmers in disaster areas solve the difficulty of lacking cotton seeds, supply and marketing cooperatives in disaster areas in Hubei Province pre-purchase cotton from disaster victims with cotton seeds. It is estimated that the first batch will distribute more than 40,000 dan of cotton seeds, which can solve the problem of seed shortage for nearly 500,000 mu of cotton fields. At present, some counties in Jingzhou and Xiaogan prefectures have completed the evaluation work of cotton seed distribution by township, and the supply and marketing cooperatives are signing cotton pre-purchase contracts with disaster victims. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Tianmen, Hanyang, Jiayu, Jianli and other counties have distributed part of the cotton seeds to disaster victims.

    河北河南江苏等省开展预购棉花工作
    国务院公布了关于预购棉花的指示以后，河北、河南、江苏、山东、陕西等省人民委员会都根据本省具体情况对棉花预购工作作了具体布置。现在，河北、河南等省各产棉区农民已开始同供销合作社订立合同，把棉花预售给国家。四月上旬，河北省主要产棉区邯郸专区的武安县，已经有一百多个乡的农业生产合作社、互助组和部分农民同供销合作社签订了合同。根据合同，这些农民将把四十三万五千九百担新棉卖给国家。河南省博爱县的六个区中，在四月中旬已经有三百六十九个农业生产合作社、三个互助组同供销合作社签订了预购合同。他们预售给国家的棉花，占全县棉花预购计划的百分之四十九点六。灵宝县虢镇附近的棉农在预售棉花时，还把大量存棉卖给国家。江苏省今年计划在南通、射阳等三十五个县预购棉花二百四十多万担。目前，射阳、南汇、常熟等县的供销合作社已经有三万多名干部参加了这一工作。
    为了结合预购棉花工作供应农民需要的生产资料和生活资料，这些省的有关财经部门正在积极进行物资调运工作。陕西省供销合作社已经把四万五千多吨化学肥料和两万多斤拌种用的农药，调运到各主要棉产区和半棉产区，并准备优先调给各棉产区大量饼肥。中国花纱布公司江苏省公司和江苏省粮食厅，早已把供应棉农的共可买二百七十万尺布的专用购布证和两千多万斤粮食准备妥当。山东省供销合作社已经把一亿一千多万斤饼肥和一千七百多万斤化学肥料，运到了产棉区的基层供销合作社。准备在棉花预购期间增加供应棉农的二千四百万斤粮食和二十四万匹棉布，省里粮食部门和花纱布公司也正在调运和储备。（据新华社讯）
    湖北省灾区供销合作社为了做好棉花预购工作和帮助灾区农民解决缺乏棉种的困难，用棉种向灾民预购棉花。预计第一批将发放棉种四万多担，可解决近五十万亩棉田缺种的问题。目前，荆州和孝感等专区有些县已经以乡为单位做好发放棉种的评议工作，供销合作社正在同灾民签订棉花预购合同。天门、汉阳、嘉鱼、监利等县的供销合作社已经将一部分棉种发放到灾民手中。
