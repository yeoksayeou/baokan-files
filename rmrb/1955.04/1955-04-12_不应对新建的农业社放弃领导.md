    Leadership Should Not Be Abandoned for Newly Established Agricultural Cooperatives
    In the autumn of 1954, eight new agricultural production cooperatives were established in Baimi District, Taixian County, Jiangsu Province. Now, the production order in these eight cooperatives is very chaotic. Some cooperatives have set production plans that are unrealistic; some cooperatives have not yet set production plans at all, and the accounts of five cooperatives have not been settled clearly to this day. The organizational structure of the management committees of most cooperatives is unsound, and some management committee members have not played their role. These eight cooperatives currently lack a total of 2,625 jin of summer planting seeds, and the lack of fertilizer is also very serious.
    The reason why the consolidation work of these agricultural cooperatives has not been done well is mainly because the Baimi District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has abandoned leadership. When the cooperatives were established in 1954, the District Committee did not conscientiously implement the principle of "the secretary takes action, the whole party runs the cooperatives." The District Committee Secretary and the District Head rarely went to these cooperatives. Only one member of the District Committee was in charge of this work. Later, this person was transferred to engage in grain procurement work, and there was no one in the District Committee specifically responsible for leading the mutual aid and cooperation work. In February 1955, the Taixian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party emphasized at the mutual aid and cooperation meeting that it was necessary to make every effort to consolidate the existing agricultural production cooperatives, but the Baimi District Committee still did not conscientiously implement this.
    Until recently, the Baimi District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has not taken effective measures to solve this problem. Sun Guoyin, the secretary of the District Committee, even said: "We talk about production mutual aid and cooperation every day, but the lower levels don't implement it when we deploy it, which is really frustrating." He also used "‘administrative work’ is really indispensable" as an excuse to shirk responsibility. The Baimi District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party should earnestly change this style and quickly shift the focus of leadership to mutual aid and cooperation. (Wang Jiaxun, Lü Ming)

### 不应对新建的农业社放弃领导

    不应对新建的农业社放弃领导
    江苏省泰县白米区一九五四年秋季新建立了八个农业生产合作社，现在这八个社的生产秩序很乱。有的社定的生产计划不切实际；有的社根本还没定生产计划，有五个社的账目直到现在还没结算清楚。大部分社的社务委员会组织机构不健全，有的社务委员没有发挥作用。这八个社现在共缺夏种种子二千六百二十五斤，缺肥现象也很严重。
    这些农业社的巩固工作所以没有做好，主要因为中共白米区委放弃了领导。在一九五四年办社时，区委就没有认真贯彻“书记动手，全党办社”的方针，区委书记和区长很少到这些社中去。区委委员中只有一个人管理这项工作。后来这个人被调去搞粮食征购工作，区委委员中就没有一个专人负责领导互助合作工作了。一九五五年二月，中共泰县县委在互助合作会议上，曾强调要全力巩固现有农业生产合作社，但是白米区委仍旧没有认真执行。
    直到最近，中共白米区委还没有采取有效措施解决这个问题。区委书记孙国寅还说：“生产互助合作天天谈，布置了下面不执行，真叫人没办法。”并用“‘行政工作’实在丢不开”为借口来推脱责任。中共白米区委应该认真改变这种作风，迅速把领导重心转向互助合作。　（王家迅、虑铭）
