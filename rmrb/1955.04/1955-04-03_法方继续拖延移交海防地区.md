Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 2nd – According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 1st: The French Federal Forces side continued to delay discussion of the issue of transferring the Haiphong area at a meeting of the Vietnam Central Joint Armistice Commission.

    Up to now, the French Federal Forces delegation has only provided the Vietnamese People's Army with a list of over twenty of the more than one hundred public institutions in Haiphong that should be handed over. Almost all the lists of public property are inconsistent with the facts, and some underreport the equipment items of the relevant agencies by more than half. Moreover, many of the machines listed in these lists are actually being damaged, or the most important parts of the machines have been removed. Regarding these missing parts, the French Federal Forces side even shamelessly stated on the list: "These parts have been removed because they are complete and usable." According to the Geneva Accords, the list should include all public property at the time the Geneva Accords came into effect, but the French side has not done so.

    The French side is continuing to collude with the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities to rob and transport equipment such as telephones, cars, patrol boats, and furniture from Haiphong's public institutions. The stolen equipment is indispensable for the normal operation of these public institutions.

### 法方继续拖延移交海防地区

    法方继续拖延移交海防地区
    新华社河内二日电　据越南通讯社一日讯：法兰西联邦部队方面在越南中央联合停战委员会会议上继续拖延移交海防地区问题的讨论。
    到目前为止，法兰西联邦部队代表团仅仅把应该移交的海防一百多个公共机关中的二十多个机关的名单交给越南人民军方面。几乎所有的公共财产清单都是和事实不符的，有些把有关机关的设备项目少报一半以上。而且，这些清单中所列的许多机器，实际上正在被损坏，或者机器上最重要的零件被卸走了。关于这些失去的零件，法兰西联邦部队方面竟然恬不知耻地在清单上注明：“这些零件因完整可用，已被卸走。”根据日内瓦协定，清单中应当包括日内瓦协定生效时的全部公共财产，但是法方没有这样做。
    法方正继续同吴庭艳当局串通劫运海防公共机关中的电话机、汽车、巡逻艇和家具等设备。盗走的设备都是这些公共机关正常工作所不可缺少的。
