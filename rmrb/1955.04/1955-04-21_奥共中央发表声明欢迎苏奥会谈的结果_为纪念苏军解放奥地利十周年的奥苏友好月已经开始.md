Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, April 17th (Tass): The Austrian Communist Party's press office has released a statement from the Party Central Committee regarding the results of the Austrian government delegation's negotiations in Moscow.

The statement said: The agreements reached between the Soviet and Austrian governments are in the interests of our people and open up promising prospects for peace in Europe. They are a major achievement not only for Austria but for all who desire the peaceful coexistence of nations and peoples. As Austrians and peace fighters, we are delighted with the agreements reached in Moscow.

The statement continued: The Soviet Union has convincingly demonstrated that it attaches great importance to restoring Austria's complete independence and ensuring prevention of any danger. West Germany's militarist and annexationist forces should understand from the outset that today's Austria is not the Austria of 1938, and our country cannot be treated as an easy target for plunder. Guaranteeing Austria's independence can become the starting point for a new peaceful development in Europe and reducing the danger of war.

According to Xinhua News Agency: The results of the Soviet-Austrian talks have created a nationwide festive atmosphere in Austria. Flags are hung everywhere to celebrate. A joyous and excited mood pervades Vienna. The Austrian people warmly welcomed the return of the government delegation. Railway workers erected a banner at a railway crossing along the delegation's route back to Vienna, which read: "Friendship with the Soviet Union is the guarantee of Austrian independence."

According to Xinhua News Agency: To commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Soviet army's liberation of Austria from the oppression of the Hitlerite invaders, the Austrian-Soviet Friendship Month began in Austria from April 14th to May 20th.

On the evening of April 15th, a grand opening ceremony for the Friendship Month was held in Vienna, attended by representatives from all walks of Austrian society, Austrian cultural workers, and Soviet guests.

Professor Hugo Glaser, President of the Austrian-Soviet Society, pointed out at the meeting: The Austrian-Soviet Friendship Month begins on a historically significant day for Austria, the day the Soviet-Austrian talks concluded successfully. The achievement of the talks is largely due to the Austrian government delegation's clear understanding of the Austrian people's friendly feelings towards the Soviet people and their desire for national independence. The Moscow talks show that if negotiations are conducted with the Soviet Union in sincerity, the desired results can be achieved. The talks also show that the Soviet government recognizes the national interests of small countries. This confirms that our statement is correct: Any policy that benefits the Austrian people will inevitably receive the full approval and support of the Soviet government. Glaser concluded by calling for strengthening cultural and economic ties between Austria and the great Soviet Union.

The next speaker was Professor A. Markushevich, head of the Soviet delegation and Vice President of the Russian Federal Academy of Educational Sciences.

    奥共中央发表声明欢迎苏奥会谈的结果
    为纪念苏军解放奥地利十周年的奥苏友好月已经开始
    新华社十八日讯　塔斯社维也纳十七日讯：奥地利共产党新闻处发表了党中央委员会关于奥地利政府代表团在莫斯科的谈判结果的声明。
    声明说：苏联和奥地利两国政府达成的协议符合于我们人民的利益，并且为欧洲的和平展开了有希望的前途。它们不仅是奥地利的，而且是所有希望各国和各国人民和平共处的人们的一个重大成就。作为奥地利人及和平战士，我们对在莫斯科达成的协议感到高兴。
    声明接着说：苏联令人信服地证明它非常重视恢复奥地利的完全独立和保证防止任何危险。西德的军国主义和并吞主义势力应该从一开始就明白：今天的奥地利不是一九三八年的奥地利，不能把我们的国家当作容易掠夺的对象。保障奥地利的独立可以成为欧洲新的和平的发展和减少战争危险的起点。
    据新华社讯　苏奥会谈的结果在奥地利造成了全民节日的气氛。全国各地都挂旗志庆。快乐激动的情绪笼罩着维也纳。奥地利人民热烈欢迎政府代表团的归来。铁路工人们在代表团回维也纳路上经过的一个铁路过道处竖起了一块横幅，上面写着：“同苏联的友谊是奥地利独立的保障。”
    据新华社讯　为了纪念苏军自希特勒侵略者压迫下解放奥地利十周年，从四月十四日到五月二十日，在奥地利开始举行奥苏友好月。
    四月十五日晚，在维也纳举行了友好月的隆重的开幕典礼，参加开幕典礼的有奥地利社会各界的代表、奥地利文化工作者和苏联来宾。
    奥苏协会会长雨果·格拉瑟教授在会上指出：奥苏友好月是在对奥地利有历史意义的日子，奥苏会谈圆满结束的日子里开始的。会谈成绩的取得在极大程度上是由于奥地利政府代表团十分清楚奥地利人民对苏联人民的友好感情和渴望祖国独立的意志。莫斯科会谈表明：如果真诚地同苏联进行谈判，是可以达成所期望的结果的。会谈也表明苏联政府承认小国的民族利益。这证实了我们的这样一种说法是正确的：凡是执行有利于奥地利人民的政策，必然会得到苏联政府方面的完全赞同和支持。格拉瑟最后号召加强奥地利同伟大苏联的文化和经济联系。
    接着讲话的是苏联代表团团长、俄罗斯联邦教育科学院副院长阿·马尔库舍维奇教授。
