Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, April 3rd: The Second Session of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania, which began on March 31st and lasted for three days, closed on the 2nd, according to TASS.

	At the first day's meeting, attendees heard and discussed the report by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Mehmet Shehu, on the domestic and international political situation, and adopted the resolution approving the government's domestic and foreign policies, as well as the declaration of the People's Assembly.

	Shehu spoke about the tasks and plans of the Albanian people in successfully completing the Five-Year Plan and in industry and agriculture for 1955. He said that the Central Committee of the Labor Party and the government have formulated measures to draft the Second Five-Year Plan by the end of this year. The Second Five-Year Plan will mark a new and important stage in Albania's socialist construction.

	Shehu said: The domestic situation in our country is unprecedentedly stable today. However, the imperialists have not abandoned their hostile conspiracies. In explaining the task of the struggle against the Paris agreements, Shehu said that we firmly believe that once the countries participating in the Moscow Conference have taken effective measures, the imperialist aggressors will have to seriously think about being more sensible not only in their actions towards the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, but also in their actions towards the people of small countries.

	Shehu concluded by saying that under the leadership of the Labor Party, the people of our country will enthusiastically continue their creative efforts to strengthen the national economy and improve the material and cultural standards of the people. We will strengthen our defense capabilities to prepare to resist any aggressor. Our people will advance along the path of strengthening the unbreakable friendship of our country with the great Soviet Union, the great China, and all People's Democracies, the path of peace, and the path of socialism.

	The head of the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation, Tarasov, spoke at this day's meeting. He said that we believe that inviting the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation to participate in the People's Assembly meeting is of great significance. Extensive contacts between parliamentarians of various countries and speeches by parliamentarians of other countries in parliament will bring these countries closer and strengthen trust and cooperation between countries. Tarasov analyzed the reasons for the aggravation of world tension. He said that our desire for peace is not a sign of weakness. We oppose the road of war because it brings unlimited pain and suffering to the working people. However, in the face of the increasingly intensified activities of the enemies of peace who are attempting to launch wars against democratic countries, the situation requires that the people of our countries immediately take effective measures to ensure security. These measures are being taken. Any imperialist adventures by the warmongers will not frighten us or catch us off guard.

	The meeting on the second day discussed and adopted the 1955 national budget. The budget's revenue is 12.3 billion leks in Albanian currency, and the expenditure is 11.6 billion leks, with revenue exceeding expenditure by 700 million leks. The budget allocates 4.575 billion leks for national economic construction, which is 30 percent more than last year. Allocations for industrial construction are more than 2 billion leks, and for agriculture 1.173 billion leks. The state budget stipulates that the expenditure for social and cultural measures is 2.1615 billion leks. Expenditure for national defense construction is 1.432 billion leks, accounting for 12 percent of the budget.

	At the last day's meeting, the representatives passed many decrees and elected the new members of the Supreme Court of the People's Republic of Albania.

    阿尔巴尼亚人民议会闭幕
    会议听取了关于国内外政治形势的报告、批准了政府的内政和外交政策，苏联最高苏维埃代表团团长讲了话
    新华社三日讯　据塔斯社地拉那讯：阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国人民议会第二次会议自三月三十一日起举行了三天的会议，已在二日闭幕。
    在第一天会议上，到会的人听取并讨论了部长会议主席穆·谢胡关于国内外的政治形势的报告，并通过了批准政府的内政和外交政策的决议和人民议会的宣言。
    谢胡谈到了阿尔巴尼亚人民在胜利完成五年计划中的任务和一九五五年工业和农业方面的任务和计划。他说，劳动党中央委员会和政府已经制定了措施，以便在今年年底以前草拟好第二个五年计划。第二个五年计划将标志着阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设中的一个新的重要阶段。
    谢胡说：我国国内局势今天是空前地稳定。但是帝国主义者并没有放弃他们的敌对的阴谋。谢胡在说明反对巴黎协定的斗争的任务时说，我们坚信，一当参加莫斯科会议国家采取了有效的措施，帝国主义侵略者将不得不认真地想一想，他们将不仅在对待苏联和各人民民主国家的行动方面要更懂事一些，而且在对待小国人民的行动方面也要更懂事一些。
    谢胡最后说，在劳动党的领导之下，我国人民将热情地为加强国民经济和提高人民的物质和文化水平而继续进行创造性的努力。我们将加强我国的防御能力，以准备抵抗任何侵略者。我国人民将沿着加强和伟大的苏联、伟大的中国以及所有人民民主国家的牢不可破的友谊的道路、和平的道路、社会主义的道路前进。
    苏联最高苏维埃代表团团长塔拉索夫在这一天的会议上讲了话。他说，我们认为邀请苏联最高苏维埃代表团参加人民议会会议具有重大的意义。各国议员之间的广泛接触以及其他国家的议员在议会发表演说，将使这些国家更加接近并加强各国间的信任和合作。塔拉索夫分析了世界紧张局势加剧的原因。他说，我们争取和平的愿望并不是软弱的表现。我们反对战争的道路，因为它给劳动人民带来无限的痛苦和灾难。但是，面对着企图对民主国家发动战争的和平敌人的日益加紧的活动，局势要求我们各国人民立即采取有效的措施来保障安全。这些措施正在采取中。战争制造者的任何帝国主义冒险都吓不倒我们或使我们措手不及。
    第二天会议讨论并通过了一九五五年国家预算。预算的收入为阿币一百二十三亿里克，支出为一百一十六亿里克，收入超过支出七亿里克。预算中用于国民经济建设方面的拨款为四十五亿七千五百万里克，比去年多百分之三十。用于工业建设方面的拨款为二十多亿里克，农业方面为十一亿七千三百万里克。国家预算中规定用于社会文化措施的经费为二十一亿六千一百五十万里克。用于国防建设方面为十四亿三千二百万里克，占预算的百分之十二。
    在最后一天会议上，代表们通过许多法令，并选举了阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国最高法院的新的组成人员。
