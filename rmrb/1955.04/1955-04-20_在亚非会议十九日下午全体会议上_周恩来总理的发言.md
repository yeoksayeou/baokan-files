Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, 19th:

Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates:

The world-renowned Asian-African Conference has begun. The delegation of the People’s Republic of China is very pleased to be able to discuss our common problems with the delegations of the Asian and African countries present at this conference. We are able to meet here, first of all, thanks to the initiative and efforts of the five initiating countries, Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan. We should also thank the Government of the Republic of Indonesia, the host of this conference, for making such excellent arrangements for the meeting.

It is the first time in history that so many countries from Asia and Africa have gathered together for a conference. More than half of the world’s population lives on the lands of Asia and Africa. The people of Asia and Africa once created brilliant ancient cultures and made tremendous contributions to mankind. In modern times, most countries in Asia and Africa have suffered from colonialist plunder and oppression to varying degrees, and have been forced into a state of poverty and backwardness. Our voices have been suppressed, our aspirations have been crushed, and our destinies have been manipulated by others, so we have had to rise up against colonialism. The calamities we have suffered for the same reasons and the struggles we have waged for the same goals have made it easy for the people of Asia and Africa to understand each other and have deeply sympathized with and cared for each other for a long time.

Now the face of the Asian-African region has undergone tremendous changes. More and more Asian and African countries are breaking away from or are breaking away from the shackles of colonialism. Colonial countries can no longer plunder and oppress in the way they used to. Today's Asia and Africa are not yesterday's Asia and Africa. Many countries in Asia and Africa, after long efforts, have taken their destiny into their own hands. Our meeting reflects this profound historical change.

Even so, the rule of colonialism in this region has not ended, and new colonialists are seeking to replace the old colonialists. Many Asian and African people are still living the lives of colonial slaves, and many Asian and African people are still suffering from racial discrimination, and their human rights are being ravaged.

The process of our Asian and African countries striving for freedom and independence is different; however, our determination to strive for and consolidate our respective freedom and independence is consistent. Regardless of how different the specific circumstances of each of our countries may be, most of our countries need to overcome the backwardness caused by colonial rule, and we should all, without foreign interference, enable our respective countries to achieve independent development in accordance with the will of our people.

The people of Asia and Africa have long suffered from the scourge of aggression and war. Many people in Asian and African regions were forced by colonialists to serve as cannon fodder in wars of aggression. The people of Asia and Africa cannot but hate wars of aggression. They know that the new threat of war not only endangers the independent development of their countries, but also strengthens colonialist enslavement. Therefore, we, the people of Asia and Africa, feel even more deeply the preciousness of world peace and national independence.

Based on these circumstances, safeguarding world peace, striving for and maintaining national independence, and promoting friendly cooperation between countries for this purpose cannot but be the common aspirations of the people of Asia and Africa.

Following the Korean armistice, the Geneva Conference, with the support of the Colombo Five-Power Conference, reached an armistice in Indochina on the basis of respect for national independence. At that time, international tensions had indeed been eased to a certain extent, bringing new hope to the people of the world, especially the people of Asia. However, the development of the international situation that followed was contrary to the hopes of the people. War crises are increasing, both in the East and the West. The wishes of the Korean and German people for peaceful reunification are being thwarted. The agreements of the Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina are in danger of being undermined. The United States continues to create tensions in the Taiwan region. More and more military bases are being established by countries outside Asia and Africa in the Asia-Africa region. They openly advocate that atomic weapons are conventional weapons and are preparing for atomic war. The people of Asia cannot forget that the first atomic bomb fell on the land of Asia, and the first person to die in a hydrogen bomb test was Asian. The people of Asian and African countries, like the people in other parts of the world, cannot but be concerned about the growing threat of war.

However, those who carry out aggression and prepare for war are only a very small minority. The vast majority of people in the world, no matter what kind of social system they live in, want peace and oppose war. The peace movement of the people of all countries in the world has developed more widely and deeply. They demand an end to the arms race, and that the major powers should first reach an agreement on arms reduction. They demand the prohibition of atomic weapons and all weapons of mass destruction. They demand that atomic energy be used for peaceful purposes and to create happiness for mankind. Their voices can no longer be ignored, and the policy of aggression and war has become increasingly unpopular. War planners are resorting to threats of war more and more frequently as a tool for pursuing their policy of aggression. However, threats of war cannot intimidate anyone with the determination to resist; they can only put the threatener in a more isolated and confused position. We believe that as long as we, together with all countries and people in the world who desire peace, are determined to safeguard peace, it is possible to safeguard peace.

Most of us Asian and African countries, including China, are still economically backward due to the long-term rule of colonialism. Therefore, we demand not only political independence, but also economic independence. Of course, our demand for political independence does not mean that we should adopt a policy of exclusion towards countries outside the Asia-Africa region. However, the era when Western countries controlled our destiny is over, and the destiny of Asian and African countries should be in the hands of the people of Asian and African countries themselves. Our efforts to achieve the economic independence of various countries do not mean that we should exclude economic cooperation with countries outside the Asia-Africa region. However, we demand a change in the state of exploitation of backward countries in the East by Western colonial countries, and we demand the development of an independent and autonomous economy in the Asian and African countries. Striving for complete independence is the goal of long-term struggle for most Asian and African countries and their people.

In China, since the people became masters of their own country, all our efforts have been to eliminate the backwardness left over from the long-term semi-colonial society and to build our country into an industrialized country. For five years, we have restored the national economy that was devastated by long-term wars, and we have started the first five-year plan for economic construction since 1953. As a result of these efforts, we have exceeded the level of any period in Chinese history in all major production sectors, such as steel, cotton cloth, and grain production. However, these achievements are very small compared to our actual needs, and we are far behind the highly developed industrial countries. Like other Asian countries, we urgently need a peaceful international environment to develop our independent and autonomous economy.

Asian and African countries that oppose colonialism and safeguard national independence cherish their national rights even more. Countries, regardless of their size, strength, or weakness, should enjoy equal rights in international relations, and their sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected and not be violated. The people of all dependent countries should enjoy the right to national self-determination and should not be subjected to persecution and massacre. People of all races, regardless of race or color, should enjoy basic human rights and should not be subjected to any abuse or discrimination. However, we cannot fail to note that the violent suppression of the people of Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria and other dependent countries striving for independence has not stopped; the racial discrimination and racist persecution being carried out in the Union of South Africa and other regions have not been stopped; and the problem of Arab refugees in Palestine has not been resolved.

Now, it should be said that opposing racial discrimination and demanding basic human rights, opposing colonialism and demanding national independence, and resolutely safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of one's own country have become the common demands of awakened Asian and African countries and their people. The struggles of the Egyptian people to recover sovereignty over the Suez Canal region and the Iranian people to recover oil sovereignty, and India's demands for the recovery of territorial rights over Goa and Indonesia's demands for the recovery of West Irian, have won the sympathy of many countries in the Asia-Africa region. Similarly, China's demand to liberate its territory of Taiwan has also won the support of all people with a sense of justice in the Asia-Africa region. This proves that we, the people of Asia and Africa, understand each other, sympathize with each other, and care for each other.

Only by respecting each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity can peace be guaranteed. Any violation of the sovereignty and territory of any country, any interference in the internal affairs of any country, will inevitably endanger peace. If all countries guarantee non-aggression against each other, conditions for peaceful coexistence can be created in the relations between countries. If all countries guarantee non-interference in internal affairs, the people of all countries will be able to choose their own political system and way of life according to their own will. The agreements of the Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina were reached on the basis that all parties concerned guaranteed respect for the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the Indochinese countries and did not interfere in their internal affairs in any way. Accordingly, the Geneva Conference stipulated that the Indochinese countries should not participate in military alliances and establish foreign military bases. This is why the Geneva Conference was able to create favorable conditions for establishing a peaceful region. However, after the Geneva Conference, we have seen the development of the opposite situation, which is not conducive to the interests of the people of the Indochinese countries and is not conducive to peace. We believe that the agreements of the Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina should be strictly and faithfully implemented, and no party should interfere with or obstruct them. The problem of the peaceful reunification of Korea should also be resolved in accordance with the same principles.

Our Asian and African countries need to cooperate economically and culturally in order to help eliminate the economic and cultural backwardness caused by the long-term plunder and oppression of colonialism. Cooperation between our Asian and African countries should be based on equality and mutual benefit, and should not be subject to any privileged conditions. Our trade and economic cooperation with each other should aim at promoting the independent economic development of each country, and should not simply make any one party a source of raw materials and a sales market for consumer goods. Our cultural exchanges with each other should respect the development of the national culture of each country, and should not obliterate the characteristics and advantages of any one country, so as to learn from and observe each other.

In today's Asia-Africa region, where the people of all countries are increasingly mastering their own destiny, even if the scale of our current economic and cultural cooperation may not be very large, it can be said with certainty that this kind of cooperation based on equality and mutual benefit has a bright future. We firmly believe that with the development of industrialization in our Asian and African countries and the improvement of people's living standards, and with the elimination of artificial external obstacles in trade relations between countries, trade and economic cooperation between our Asian and African countries will be increasingly enhanced, and cultural exchanges will also become more frequent.

According to the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, countries with different social systems can achieve peaceful coexistence. On the basis of guaranteeing the implementation of these principles, there is no reason why international disputes cannot be resolved through consultation.

In order to safeguard world peace, we, the Asian and African countries in roughly the same situation, should first of all cooperate in a friendly manner and achieve peaceful coexistence. The discord and estrangement caused by colonial rule in the past between Asian and African countries should not continue to exist. We should respect each other and eliminate any doubts and fears that may exist between us.

The Government of the People's Republic of China fully agrees with the purposes of the Asian-African Conference as defined in the Joint Communiqué of the Bogor Conference of the Five Prime Ministers of South Asia. We also believe that, in order to make a contribution to the promotion of world peace and cooperation, the Asian and African countries should first seek mutual goodwill and cooperation and establish friendly and good-neighborly relations based on common interests. India, Burma and China have established the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the principles guiding mutual relations. These principles have won the support of more and more countries. In accordance with these principles, the preliminary negotiations between China and Indonesia on the issue of the nationality of overseas Chinese in the two countries have achieved good results. At the Geneva Conference, China also expressed its willingness to develop friendly relations with the Indochinese countries on the basis of these five principles. According to these five principles, there is no reason why the relations between China and its neighbors such as Thailand and the Philippines cannot be improved. China is willing to strictly abide by these principles as the basis for establishing normal relations with other Asian and African countries, and is willing to promote the normalization of relations between China and Japan. In order to enhance mutual understanding and cooperation between our Asian and African countries, we suggest that the governments, parliaments and non-governmental organizations of the Asian and African countries implement mutual friendly visits.

Mr. Chairman, distinguished gentlemen, the era of arbitrarily manipulating the destiny of the Asian and African people is gone forever. We believe that if we are determined to safeguard world peace, no one can drag us into war; if we are determined to strive for and maintain national independence, no one can continue to enslave us; if we are determined to cooperate in a friendly manner, no one can divide us.

What our Asian and African countries need is peace and independence, and we have no intention of antagonizing Asian and African countries with countries in other regions. We also need to establish peaceful cooperative relations with countries in other regions.

Our meeting is a rare one. Although there are many differences among us, this should not affect our common desire. Our meeting should express our common desire, so that it becomes a precious page in Asian and African history. At the same time, the contacts we have established in this conference should be maintained, so that we can make a greater contribution to world peace.

His Excellency President Sukarno of the Republic of Indonesia is right, we, the people of Asia and Africa, must unite.

Let us wish the conference success.

### 在亚非会议十九日下午全体会议上  周恩来总理的发言

专栏：

    在亚非会议十九日下午全体会议上
    周恩来总理的发言主席、各位代表先生：
    举世瞩目的亚非会议已经开始。中华人民共和国代表团能同与会的各国代表团一起在这个会议上讨论我们亚非国家的共同问题，感到非常高兴。我们能够在这里会晤，首先要感谢缅甸、锡兰、印度、印度尼西亚和巴基斯坦五个发起国家的倡议和努力，我们还应当感谢这次会议的主人印度尼西亚共和国政府为会议作了很好的安排。
    亚非两洲有这么多的国家在一起举行会议，这在历史上还是第一次。在我们亚非两洲的土地上生活着全世界半数以上的人民。亚非人民曾经创造过光辉灿烂的古代文化，对人类作出了巨大的贡献。近代以来，亚非两洲的大多数国家在不同程度上遭受了殖民主义的掠夺和压迫，以致被迫处于贫困和落后的停滞状态。我们的呼声受到抑制，我们的愿望受到摧残，我们的命运被旁人摆布，因此我们不得不起而反对殖民主义。由于同样的原因而受到的灾难和为了同样的目的而进行的斗争，使我们亚非各国人民容易互相了解，并在长期以来就深切地互相同情和关怀。
    现在亚非地区的面貌已经发生了巨大的变化。越来越多的亚非国家摆脱了或正在摆脱着殖民主义的束缚。殖民国家已经不能用过去那样的方式来进行掠夺和压迫。今天的亚洲和非洲已经不是昨天的亚洲和非洲。亚非两洲的许多国家，经过长期的努力，已经把他们的命运掌握在自己手中。我们的会议反映了这一深刻的历史变化。
    虽然如此，殖民主义在这个地区的统治并没有结束，而且新的殖民主义者正在谋取旧的殖民主义者的地位而代之。不少亚非人民还在过着殖民地的奴隶生活，不少亚非人民还在受着种族歧视，他们的人权遭受着摧残。
    我们亚非各国人民争取自由和独立的过程是不同的；但是，我们争取和巩固各自的自由和独立的意志是一致的。不管我们每一个国家的具体情况如何不同，我们大多数国家都需要克服殖民主义统治所造成的落后状态，我们都应该在不受外来干涉的情况下按照我们各国人民的意志，使我们各自的国家获得独立的发展。
    亚非人民曾经长期遭受侵略和战争的苦难。许多亚非地区的人民曾经被殖民主义者强迫充当进行侵略战争的炮灰。亚非人民不能不痛恨侵略战争。他们知道，新的战争威胁不仅危害到他们国家的独立发展，而且还要加强殖民主义的奴役。因此，我们亚非人民更加深切地感觉到世界和平和民族独立的可贵。
    基于这些情况，保障世界和平、争取和维护民族独立并为此目的而促进各国间的友好合作就不能不是亚非各国人民的共同愿望。
    接着朝鲜停战之后，日内瓦会议曾经在尊重民族独立的基础上，得到科伦坡五国会议的支持，达成了印度支那的停战。当时，国际的紧张局势确曾得到一定程度的缓和，给全世界人民特别是亚洲人民带来了新的希望。但是，跟着而来的国际形势的发展却和人民的希望相反。无论在东方和西方，战争危机都在增加。朝鲜人民和德国人民要求和平统一的愿望受到阻挠。日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平问题的协议有被破坏的危险。美国在台湾地区继续制造紧张局势。亚非以外国家在亚非地区建立的军事基地越来越多。他们公开鼓吹原子武器是常规武器，准备原子战争。亚洲人民不能忘记第一颗原子弹是落在亚洲的土地上，第一个死在氢弹试验下的是亚洲人。亚非各国人民和世界其他地区的人民一样，不能不关切日益增长的战争威胁。
    但是进行侵略、准备战争的人究竟是极少数。世界上不论是生活在哪一种社会制度中的绝大多数人民都要求和平，反对战争。世界各国人民的和平运动有了更加广泛和深入的发展。他们要求终止扩军备战的竞赛，首先各大国应该就裁减军备达成协议。他们要求禁止原子武器和一切大规模毁灭性武器。他们要求将原子能用于和平用途，为人类创造幸福。他们的呼声已经不能被忽视，侵略和战争的政策已经日益不得人心。战争策划者日益频繁地诉之于战争威胁，作为推行侵略政策的工具。但是，战争威胁是吓不倒任何具有抵抗决心的人的，它只能使威胁者自己陷于更加孤立和更加混乱的地位。我们相信，只要我们同世界一切愿意和平的国家和人民一道，决心维护和平，和平是有可能维护得住的。
    我们大多数亚非国家，包括中国在内，由于殖民主义的长期统治，经济上还很落后。因此，我们不仅要求政治上的独立，同时还要求经济上的独立。当然，我们要求政治独立并不是要对亚非地区以外的国家采取排斥的政策。但是，西方国家控制我们命运的时代已经过去了，亚非国家的命运应该由亚非各国人民自己掌握。我们要努力实现各国的经济独立，这也并不是要排斥同亚非地区以外的国家的经济合作。但是，我们要求改变西方殖民国家对东方落后国家的剥削状态，我们要求发展亚非各国独立自主的经济。争取完全独立是我们大多数亚非国家和人民长期奋斗的目标。
    在中国，自从人民作了自己国家的主人以后，我们的一切努力就是要消除长期的半殖民地社会遗留下来的落后状态，把我们的国家建设成为一个工业化的国家。五年以来，我们恢复了遭受长期战争破坏的国民经济，并且从一九五三年起开始了经济建设的第一个五年计划。由于这些努力，我们在各个主要生产部门，例如钢铁、棉布、粮食的生产量，都已经超过了中国历史上任何一个时期的水平。但是，这些成就比之于我们的实际需要还微小得很，比之于工业高度发展的国家，我们还落后得很。正像其他的亚洲国家一样，我们迫切地需要一个和平的国际环境，来发展我国独立自主的经济。
    反对殖民主义、维护民族独立的亚非国家更加珍视自己的民族权利。国家不分大小强弱，在国际关系中都应该享有平等的权利，它们的主权和领土完整都应该得到尊重，而不应受到侵犯。所有附属国人民都应该享有民族自决的权利，而不应遭受迫害和屠杀。各族人民不分种族和肤色都应该享有基本人权，而不应该受到任何虐待和歧视。但是，我们不能不注意到：对突尼斯、摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚和其他争取独立的附属国人民的暴力镇压还没有停止；在南非联邦和其他地区进行着的种族歧视和种族主义的迫害还没有制止；在巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯难民问题还没有解决。
    现在，应该说，反对种族歧视、要求基本人权，反对殖民主义、要求民族独立，坚决维护自己国家的主权和领土完整，已经是觉醒了的亚非国家和人民的共同要求。埃及人民为收复苏彝士运河地区的主权和伊朗人民为收复石油主权而进行的斗争，印度对果阿和印度尼西亚对西伊里安岛恢复领土权利的要求，获得了亚非地区许多国家的同情。同样，中国解放自己领土台湾的要求也获得了亚非地区一切具有正义感的人民的支持。这证明我们亚非各国人民是互相了解、互相同情和互相关切的。
    只有互相尊重主权和领土完整，和平才有保障。对于任何一个国家主权和领土的侵犯，对于任何一个国家内政的干涉，都不可避免地要危及和平。如果各国保证互不侵犯，就可以在各国的关系中创造和平共处的条件。如果各国保证互不干涉内政，各国人民就有可能按照他们自己的意志选择他们自己的政治制度和生活方式。日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议就是在有关各方保证尊重印度支那各国的独立、主权、统一和领土完整并对其内政不予任何干涉的基础上达成的。据此，日内瓦会议并规定，印度支那各国不参加军事同盟和建立外国军事基地。这就是为什么日内瓦会议能够为建立和平地区创造了有利的条件。但是在日内瓦会议之后，我们却看到了一种相反的情况在发展，这是不利于印度支那各国人民的利益的，也是不利于和平的。我们认为，日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议应该严格地和忠实地予以履行，任何方面不得加以干涉和阻挠。朝鲜的和平统一问题也应该按照同样的原则予以解决。
    我们亚非国家需要在经济上和文化上合作，以便有助于消除我们在殖民主义的长期掠夺和压迫下所造成的经济上和文化上的落后状态。我们亚非国家之间的合作应该以平等互利为基础，而不应该附有任何特权条件。我们相互之间的贸易来往和经济合作应该以促进各国独立经济发展为目的，而不应该使任何一方单纯地成为原料产地和消费品的销售市场。我们相互之间的文化交流应该尊重各国民族文化的发展，而不抹煞任何一国的特长和优点，以便互相学习和观摩。
    在我们亚非地区的各国人民日益掌握了自己命运的今天，即使我们在目前的经济和文化的合作规模还不可能很大，但是，可以肯定地说，这种建立在平等互利的基础上的合作是有远大的发展前途的。我们深信，随着我们亚非国家工业化的发展和人民生活水平的提高，随着各国间贸易关系中人为的外来的障碍的消除，我们亚非各国间的贸易来往和经济合作将会日益增进，文化交流也将日益频繁。
    根据互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利的原则，社会制度不同的国家是可以实现和平共处的。在保证实施这些原则的基础上，国际间的争端没有理由不能够协商解决。
    为了维护世界和平，我们处境大致相同的亚非国家首先应该友好合作，实现和平共处。过去殖民统治在亚非国家间所造成的不和和隔阂，不应该继续存在。我们应该互相尊重，消除互相间可能存在的疑虑和恐惧。
    中华人民共和国政府完全同意南亚五国总理在茂物会议联合公报中所确定的关于亚非会议的目的。我们并认为，为了对于促进世界和平和合作作出贡献，亚非各国应该首先根据共同的利益，谋求相互间的亲善和合作，建立友好和睦邻的关系。印度、缅甸和中国曾经确定了和平共处五项原则作为指导相互关系的原则。这些原则获得了越来越多的国家的支持。本着这些原则，中国同印度尼西亚关于两国侨民国籍问题的初步谈判已经取得了良好的结果。在日内瓦会议时，中国也曾表示愿意在这五项原则的基础上同印度支那各国发展友好的关系。根据这五项原则，中国同泰国、菲律宾等邻国的关系没有理由不能获得改善。中国愿以严格遵守这些原则作为它同亚非其他国家建立正常关系的基础，并愿促进中国和日本关系的正常化。为了增进我们亚非各国间的相互了解和合作，我们建议亚非各国的政府、国会和民间团体实行互相的友好访问。
    主席，各位先生，任意摆布亚非人民命运的时代已经一去不复返了。我们相信，如果我们决心维护世界和平，就没有人能够把我们拖入战争；如果我们决心争取和维护民族独立，就没有人能够继续奴役我们；如果我们决心友好合作，就没有人能够分裂我们。
    我们亚非国家所需要的是和平和独立，我们并无意于使亚非国家同其他地区的国家对立，我们同样需要同其他地区的国家建立和平合作的关系。
    我们的会晤是难得的。尽管我们中间存在着许多不同意见，但是这不应该影响我们所具有的共同愿望。我们的会议应该对于我们的共同愿望有所表示，使它成为亚非历史值得珍贵的一页。同时，我们在这次会议中建立起来的接触应该继续保持，以便我们对于世界和平能够作出更大的贡献。
    印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺阁下说得对，我们亚非人民必须团结起来。
    让我们预祝会议成功。
