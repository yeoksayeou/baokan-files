Xinhua News Agency, April 27th: He Xiangning, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, issued a statement on April 26th regarding the Treaty on Dual Nationality. The full text is as follows:

    The negotiations between our country and the government of the Republic of Indonesia on the issue of dual nationality have reached an agreement. The "Treaty Between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia on the Question of Dual Nationality," signed by the plenipotentiary representatives of both contracting parties, was announced on April 26th. On behalf of all overseas Chinese compatriots, I would like to express my warm congratulations and pledge to work hard to implement this treaty.

    This treaty was signed by our country and the government of the Republic of Indonesia after full consultation based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. The negotiation process, the spirit, and the content of the treaty reflect China's sincerity in resolving international issues with the Republic of Indonesia through consultation on the basis of seeking common ground while reserving differences. It embodies the ever-increasing friendly and cooperative relations between China and the Republic of Indonesia, China's consistent policy of protecting the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese and not interfering in local internal affairs, and China's deep consideration for the vital interests of overseas Chinese and the democratic spirit of voluntary choice of nationality. It is evident that the signing of this treaty will help promote the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and create a model for China and relevant countries to resolve similar issues.

    Now that the treaty resolving the issue of dual nationality has been announced, I earnestly hope that people living in the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia who hold dual nationality will welcome and support this treaty and work together to realize the various provisions of this treaty. According to the provisions of the treaty, those who originally held dual nationality and are 18 years of age or older, or under 18 but already married, should, within the two-year period of the treaty's validity, choose one nationality, either the nationality of the People's Republic of China or the nationality of the Republic of Indonesia, according to the principle of voluntary choice, and become either citizens of the People's Republic of China or citizens of the Republic of Indonesia. There are also detailed provisions for the nationality of minors or those who have not chosen a nationality after the two-year period of the treaty's validity has expired, as well as for the withdrawal of nationality, which fully demonstrates the spirit of voluntarism and democracy. Our country, of course, welcomes those who choose Chinese nationality, and we also express a sincere attitude of friendship towards those who choose Indonesian nationality. As everyone knows, our overseas Chinese compatriots have left their hometowns, traveled across the ocean, and worked diligently in Indonesia for generations, overcoming obstacles and making significant contributions to the local economic life and cultural development. Due to their living environment, they have deep friendships with the local people and are accustomed to local social customs. Therefore, it is natural for some people to choose Indonesian nationality based on their own actual circumstances. The government and people of our country will respect their voluntary choice and maintain sincere friendship with them. For those who choose Chinese nationality, the motherland government will, of course, continue to care for and protect their legitimate rights and interests as in the past. Therefore, I hope that people with dual nationality will sincerely implement the provisions of the treaty and earnestly choose their nationality within the prescribed time limit. After choosing different nationalities, there should be no discrimination among them. Whether choosing Chinese nationality or Indonesian nationality, everyone should work together in the spirit of friendship and unity, mutual understanding, and mutual assistance to promote friendly and good-neighborly relations between the two countries. I hope that those who choose Chinese nationality will make even greater efforts in this regard. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique will inevitably follow the instructions of its masters in our process of resolving dual nationality, wantonly engaging in instigation and sabotage. We must be constantly vigilant and expose the special agents of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique who take the opportunity to create disputes and undermine the friendship and unity between overseas Chinese and the local people.

    The treaty stipulates that both parties agree to encourage their respective nationals to respect the laws and social customs of the country of residence and not to participate in the political activities of the country of residence. It should be pointed out that this provision of the treaty is consistent with our established policy on overseas Chinese affairs. Our government has always encouraged overseas Chinese compatriots in this spirit. Now, in accordance with the provisions of the treaty, I specifically call on overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia, whether they originally held a single nationality of the People's Republic of China or have chosen Chinese nationality in accordance with the provisions of the treaty, to work towards the realization of this provision and the implementation of our established policy. It is necessary to pay attention to and expose the subversive activities carried out by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, under the command of certain imperialists, in Southeast Asian countries where overseas Chinese reside. They want to use this to realize the "one stone, two birds" conspiracy plan carried out by their masters, which is to subvert the local government and at the same time undermine the friendly relations between China and Indonesia. The subversive activities of Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique special agents Zhang Xunyi and Zhu Changdong, which occurred in Indonesia this year, are an example. Various facts have proven that the newspapers and other special agencies established by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in Indonesia are special organizations dedicated to carrying out subversive activities and opposing the People's Republic of China. We believe that the Indonesian government's arrest of Chiang agents Zhang Xunyi, Zhu Changdong, etc., and the opinions put forward by many members of the Indonesian Parliament and public opinion demanding the banning of Chiang Kai-shek's special agencies and Chiang Kai-shek's special newspapers in Indonesia, are of great benefit to promoting friendly relations between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia. These Chiang agents only have a way out by abandoning darkness and turning to the light, and breaking away from the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

    The treaty also stipulates that the contracting parties are willing to protect the legitimate rights and interests of each other's nationals in accordance with their respective laws. This is an obligation that the contracting parties should fulfill, and it further demonstrates the spirit of equality and mutual benefit between our contracting parties.

    The signing of the treaty between our country and the Republic of Indonesia on resolving the issue of dual nationality has received close attention from overseas Chinese with dual nationality in other regions and from relevant countries, which is entirely understandable. At the first session of the First National People's Congress of our country last year, Premier Zhou Enlai stated in his report that China was preparing to resolve the nationality issue of overseas Chinese and was prepared to first resolve this issue with Southeast Asian countries that have established diplomatic relations. The signing of this treaty between our country and the government of the Republic of Indonesia is a good start and a model for our country and relevant countries to resolve the issue of dual nationality. According to Premier Zhou Enlai's instructions, our country is paying attention to resolving this issue jointly with other countries, especially Southeast Asian countries that have established diplomatic relations, through diplomatic channels and in the spirit of friendly consultation.

    However, there are still some people who, on the one hand, continue to persecute our overseas Chinese compatriots with various brutal means, such as arrests, shootings, mass imprisonments, large-scale expulsions, economic persecution of all kinds, plundering the property of our overseas Chinese compatriots, forcing them to serve in the military, and attempting to eliminate the right of our overseas Chinese compatriots to receive education in their mother tongue... etc.; on the other hand, they imagine that the People's Republic of China will abandon its responsibility to protect the legitimate rights and interests of our overseas Chinese and allow them to persecute and enslave overseas Chinese with impunity. This unjust act and idea of resolving the issue of dual nationality by unilateral and coercive means will naturally not resolve any problems, nor will it be acceptable to the vast majority of our overseas Chinese. We hope that they can change this idea and its policies in order to facilitate the resolution of this issue.

    In order to celebrate the promulgamation of the "Treaty Between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia on the Issue of Dual Nationality," I hope that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence can be further promoted, and that the friendly relations between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia and the friendship between the two peoples can be further enhanced.

    关于双重国籍问题的条约的谈话
    新华社二十七日讯　中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会何香凝主任，二十六日发表关于双重国籍问题的条约的谈话，全文如下：
    我国和印度尼西亚共和国政府关于双重国籍问题的谈判已达成协议，于四月二十六日公布了由缔约双方全权代表签字的“中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国关于双重国籍问题的条约”。我谨代表全体国外侨胞表示热烈的庆贺，并保证为贯彻这条约的实施而努力。
    这条约是我国和印度尼西亚共和国政府根据平等互利和互不干涉当地内政的原则，经过充分的协商之后签订的。谈判的过程和条约的精神与内容，体现了我国真诚地与印度尼西亚共和国在求同的基础上通过协商的途径解决国际问题，我国和印度尼西亚共和国日益增进的友好合作关系，体现了我国保护华侨正当权利与利益和不干涉当地内政的一贯政策，我国深切照顾华侨切身利益和自愿选择国籍的民主精神。由此可见，这条约的签订，将有助于和平共处五项原则的推广，为我国与有关国家解决同类性质问题创造了范例。
    现在解决双重国籍问题的条约已经公布，我热切希望生活在中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国而持有双重国籍的人们，都来欢迎和拥护这条约，共同为实现这条约的各项规定而努力。根据条约的规定，原来具有双重国籍而年满十八岁或未满十八岁但已结婚的人，应在条约生效两年期限内，根据本人自愿的原则，就中华人民共和国国籍和印度尼西亚共和国国籍中选择一种国籍，作为中华人民共和国公民或是印度尼西亚共和国公民。对于未成年或超过条约生效两年期限而未选择国籍的人的国籍以及退出国籍等问题，也有详细的规定，充分表现了自愿和民主的精神。我国对选择中华人民共和国国籍的人，固然表示欢迎，对选择印度尼西亚共和国国籍的人，也同样表示真诚的友谊态度。大家知道，我国侨胞离乡别井，远涉重洋，在印度尼西亚世代相传的辛勤劳动，披荆斩棘，对当地的经济生活和文化建树都有重大的贡献，他们由于生活环境的关系，和当地人民有深厚的友谊，也习惯于当地的社会风俗，因此，有一部分人根据本身的实际情况，选择印度尼西亚共和国国籍，这是自然的，我国政府和人民，将尊重他们的自愿选择，并将对他们保持真诚的友谊。对于一部分选择中华人民共和国国籍的人，祖国政府当然也是和过去一样的关怀和保护他们的正当权利和利益。因此，我希望具有双重国籍的人们，应当真诚地执行条约的规定，在限期内认真地选择自己的国籍。在选择不同国籍之后，不应在彼此之间有任何的歧视。不论是选择中华人民共和国国籍或是选择印度尼西亚共和国国籍，都要本着友好团结的精神，互相谅解，互助互济，为促进两国友好睦邻关系共同努力。并期望选择中华人民共和国国籍的人，在这方面要更加努力。蒋介石卖国集团在我们解决双重国籍的过程中，必然秉承其主子的意旨，肆意进行挑拨与破坏，我们更要时刻警惕和揭露蒋介石卖国集团特务分子乘机制造纠纷，破坏华侨和当地人民的友谊团结。
    条约规定双方同意勉励本国侨民尊重侨居国政府的法律和社会习惯，不参加侨居国的政治活动。应该指出，条约的这项规定，是和我国既定的侨务政策一致的，我国政府向来就以这种精神来勉励国外侨胞。现在我特根据条约的规定，号召侨居于印度尼西亚的侨胞，在双重国籍解决后，不论原是中华人民共和国单一国籍的或根据条约规定而选择中华人民共和国国籍的侨胞，都要为实现这项规定和贯彻我国既定政策而努力。必须注意和揭露蒋介石卖国集团在某些帝国主义的指挥下，在东南亚华侨侨居国所进行的颠覆活动，他们想借此以实现其主子所进行的颠覆当地政府，同时又可以破坏中国和印度尼西亚两国友好关系的，“一石二鸟”的阴谋计划。如在印度尼西亚今年所发生的蒋介石卖国集团特务爪牙章勋义和朱昌东的颠覆活动，即是一例。蒋介石卖国集团现在在印度尼西亚所设立的报馆以及其他特务机构，各种事实都已经证明了，是专为进行颠覆活动和反对中华人民共和国的特务组织。对于印度尼西亚共和国政府拘捕蒋特章勋义朱昌东等，印度尼西亚共和国国会许多议员和社会舆论提出要求取缔在印度尼西亚的蒋介石的特务机构，和蒋介石特务报馆的意见，我们认为这对于促进中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国之间的友好关系，是大有裨益的。这些蒋特分子，只有弃暗投明，脱离蒋介石卖国集团才有出路。
    条约还规定了缔约双方愿意各自依照本国的法律互相保护对方侨民的正当权利和利益。这是缔约双方应尽的义务，更表现了我们缔约双方平等互利的精神。
    我国和印度尼西亚共和国签订了解决双重国籍问题的条约，受到其它地区具有双重国籍的侨民的密切关怀，和有关国家的注意，这是完全可以理解的。去年我国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上，周恩来总理在他所作的报告中，就曾经说明我国准备解决华侨的国籍问题，并且准备首先同已经建交的东南亚国家解决这个问题。这次我国和印度尼西亚共和国政府签订这项条约，就是我国和有关国家解决双重国籍问题的一个良好的开端，是一个范例。根据周恩来总理的指示，我国是注意和其它国家首先是东南亚建交国家，通过外交途径，本着友好协商的精神，共同解决这一问题的。
    但是，目前仍然有一些人，他们一方面不断地用各种残暴的手段，迫害我国侨民，如拘捕、枪杀、集体监禁、大批驱逐，在经济上进行各种各式的迫害，掠夺我国侨民的财产，强迫服兵役，妄图消灭我国侨民受祖国语文教育的权利……等等；另一方面，他们又设想我中华人民共和国放弃保护我们国外侨民的正当权利和利益的责任，而可以任由他们对华侨去肆无忌惮地进行迫害与奴役，这种要用片面的强制的手段，来解决双重国籍问题的不义的作为和想法，自然是不可能解决任何问题的，当然也是我们国外广大的侨民所不能接受的，我们希望他们能改变这种想法及其政策，以利于这一问题的解决。
    为了庆贺“中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国关于双重国籍问题的条约”的公布，我期望和平共处五项原则能进一步推广，中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国的邦交和两国人民的友好关系能进一步增强。
