    Welcome the Victorious Opening of the Asian-African Conference

    The historically significant Asian-African Conference opens today in Bandung, Indonesia. Government delegations from twenty-nine countries with a total population of 1.44 billion—the five sponsoring countries of Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan, the People's Republic of China, and other invited countries—are attending the conference. The people of Asia and Africa warmly welcome this grand gathering. Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetsov issued a statement sincerely wishing the Bandung Conference success and expressing his firm belief that this conference "will be a new step for the peoples of all countries in developing international cooperation to ease international tensions and maintain world peace." The Asian Countries Conference, which just concluded in Delhi, India, unanimously passed a letter to the Bandung Conference, wishing the Asian-African Conference great success. Peace-loving countries and people all over the world have also expressed widespread support. This conference is attracting the attention of world opinion. The Chinese people are celebrating the victorious opening of the Asian-African Conference with boundless excitement and wishing the conference success.

    The convening of the Asian-African Conference is a historic first. This is a major signal: the people of Asian and African countries want to manage their own affairs and can no longer be managed by others. As Indian Prime Minister Nehru said, "Asia has entered a new century, and others can no longer decide its fate. The days when Europeans or Americans could decide the fate of Asian and African countries are gone." The people of Asian and African countries want to take their own destiny into their own hands and cooperate in a friendly manner with all countries in the world on an equal footing. No one can change this determination of the Asian and African people. It will not only determine the future development of Asian and African countries, but also have a huge impact on the world situation.

    The important purpose of the Asian-African Conference is to promote amity and cooperation between Asian and African countries, to explore and promote common interests, and to establish and enhance friendly and good-neighborly relations. This is in line with the broad aspirations of the countries and people in this region and is fully in line with the purposes and spirit of the United Nations Charter. Although there are great differences in the social systems and specific circumstances of the countries in this region, and abnormal states still exist in the relations between many countries, common history, the common desire to maintain and strive for peaceful independence, and to improve backward economic conditions enable everyone to discuss major issues of common concern together, thereby helping to expand contacts and connections in all aspects in order to eliminate the fears and misunderstandings imposed by external factors. Peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between many countries in this region are being established and developed, and the atmosphere of understanding and mutual trust is growing and expanding. The increase in friendly relations between China and India, China and Burma, and China and Indonesia, the conclusion of the friendship treaty between India and Egypt, and the positive results of the recent visit of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to India and Burma are all good examples.

    Today, the issue of maintaining and striving for independence is still an issue of particular interest to the broad masses of people in Asian and African countries. Colonialist forces still exist in large areas of Asia and Africa, where the backward and poverty situation is intensifying, and the people are not able to enjoy the right to freedom; at the same time, this force is still trying to expand its position and deprive more countries of their national sovereignty. The barbaric crimes of racism continue. In South Africa, Africans, Indians, Chinese, and other people of color, who constitute the majority of the population, are subjected to inhuman discrimination and persecution. The cruel rule of colonialism hinders the revitalization of vast areas of Asia and Africa and becomes a serious obstacle to restoring normal relations between countries. The people of Asian and African countries cannot tolerate this situation continuing. Countries that have already achieved independence and freedom will never be willing to lose their independence again. The struggle of patriots who are striving for national independence and opposing racial discrimination is supported by the people of Asian and African countries and peace-loving people all over the world. Ending colonial rule in the Asian-African region is the unanimous call of the people of Asian and African countries.

    In the Asian-African region, the desire to establish and develop economic cooperation and cultural exchanges is becoming increasingly urgent. Our region has abundant resources, industrious people, and a glorious cultural heritage. Without foreign exploitation, interference, and obstruction, there would have long been unlimited prosperity and development. In recent years, the economic situation of some independent countries has improved greatly, cultural life has begun to be reactivated, and mutual assistance and cooperation between them have also developed significantly. This is a very encouraging situation. However, in order for this region to achieve full and complete revitalization, it is necessary to continue to break foreign monopolies and shackles, strive for cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and promote exchanges. The policies of blockade and embargo currently imposed on many Asian and African countries, and the piratical acts that undermine freedom of navigation and commercial exchanges, are being met with increasingly strong opposition. The struggle of Asian and African countries and peoples for a prosperous and happy future is irresistible.

    The struggle of Asian and African countries for friendly cooperation and the safeguarding of independence and freedom is increasingly becoming a powerful force for defending peace and opposing war. The people of Asia and Africa love peace. They have fresh memories of the serious disasters suffered by this region in the past two world wars. Countries that are rebuilding their new lives understand the value of peace in particular. Our common interests are not confrontation, division, and war, but peace. Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo once said: "We hope that the Asian-African Conference will begin a new chapter in the history of mankind's efforts to achieve world peace." Burmese Prime Minister U Nu also said that the Asian-African Conference is to facilitate mutual understanding and expand the area of peace. The slanderous and provocative remarks that those countries and peoples who have freed themselves from national oppression and enslavement and have gained freedom and liberation will harbor so-called attempts to oppress and enslave other nations are doomed to bankruptcy. More and more countries are not being trapped by these lies. The establishment of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is expanding the area of peace. People all over the world are increasingly seeing that the Five Principles are in line with the United Nations Charter and in line with the people's desire for peace. The convening of the Asian-African Conference provides a good opportunity for Asian and African countries with different social systems to practice peaceful coexistence and contribute to promoting world peace and security.

    It must be pointed out that the danger of a new war is still growing, and the peace and security of the Asian-African region are facing increasingly serious threats. The United States is attempting to strengthen the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, step up the formation of aggressive groups in the Middle East and alliances in Northeast Asia, expand the network of military bases that cover Asia and Africa, and carry out arrogant atomic war threats against the people of Asia and Africa. At the same time, under the peaceful disguise of so-called "ceasefire," the United States is strengthening its military deployment in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, and intensifying its war provocations against China. The United States' conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Accords and the Korean Armistice Agreement is also making the situation in this region increasingly tense. All these activities of the United States are clearly aimed at provoking a new war in order to achieve its goal of enslaving the people of Asia and Africa and all mankind. It is hostile to the initiative and convening of the Asian-African Conference. It is doing everything possible to carry out various provocations and sabotage activities in an attempt to provoke disputes and make the conference unproductive. Immediately before the Asian-African Conference, the U.S. aggressive bloc colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to carry out the shameful international political conspiracy of murdering members of our delegation to the Asian-African Conference and Chinese and foreign journalists. But the U.S. aggressive bloc's conspiracy to use this to intensify the tense situation and undermine the Asian-African Conference is doomed to failure.

    The victorious convening of the Asian-African Conference shows that the just cause supported by hundreds of millions of people cannot be defeated. The contributions of the sponsoring countries of the conference, the Colombo Conference countries, have particularly won the praise of the people of Asia and Africa. The people of Asian and African countries and fair-minded public opinion generally demand that governments of all countries, in the interests of their nations and the interests of peace, work together to achieve positive results at the Asian-African Conference. All the goodwill, expectations, and confidence expressed in the Asian-African Conference stem from loyalty to and love of lasting peace and international cooperation. This is a sincere expression of human conscience. The powerful moral force of the Asian-African Conference lies here.

    The government and people of the People's Republic of China fully support the efforts of the Asian-African Conference to maintain peace through friendly cooperation. Premier Zhou Enlai stated in his reply to Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo: "The Government of the People's Republic of China agrees with the aims of the Asian-African Conference and is honored to have the opportunity to work together with other Asian and African countries for these aims." This fully expresses the feelings of the 600 million Chinese people. The aims of the Asian-African Conference are in line with our country's foreign policy of maintaining world peace and promoting friendly cooperation between countries. Our country's peaceful foreign policy has been enshrined in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. The Preamble to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China states: "Our country's policy of establishing and developing diplomatic relations with any country on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity has achieved success and will continue to be implemented in the future. In international affairs, our country's unwavering policy is to strive for the lofty goal of world peace and human progress." The government delegation of our country, headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, will work together with the delegations of Asian and African countries in accordance with this foreign policy to strive for the success of the Asian-African Conference. The Chinese people fully support this effort by our delegation and other delegations.

### 欢迎亚非会议胜利召开

    欢迎亚非会议胜利召开
    具有历史意义的亚非会议，今天在印度尼西亚的万隆开幕。有着十四亿四千万人民的二十九个国家——缅甸、锡兰、印度、印度尼西亚和巴基斯坦五个发起国、中华人民共和国和其他被邀请国的政府代表团，出席会议。亚非两大洲的人民，热烈欢迎这一盛大的集会。苏联外交部第一副部长库兹涅佐夫发表声明，衷心预祝万隆会议获得成功，并表示深信这个会议“将是各国人民在为缓和国际紧张局势和维护世界和平而发展国际合作方面的一个新的步骤”。刚在印度德里闭幕的亚洲国家会议一致通过了致万隆会议书，预祝亚非会议获得巨大的成就。全世界爱好和平的国家和人民，也普遍表示支持。这个会议吸引着全世界舆论的注意力。中国人民以无限兴奋的心情庆贺亚非会议的胜利召开，并预祝会议成功。
    亚非会议的召开，在历史上还是第一次。这是一个重大的信号：亚非各国人民要自己管理自己的事务，而不能再由别人来管理。印度总理尼赫鲁就说：“亚洲已进入新的世纪，其他人再也不能决定它的命运了。欧洲人或美洲人能够决定亚非国家的命运的日子已经一去不返了。”亚非各国的人民要把自己的命运掌握在自己的手里，同时以平等的地位同世界上一切国家友好合作。亚非人民的这一决心是谁也没有法子加以改变的，它不但要决定亚非各国的发展前途，并将要对世界局势发生巨大的影响。
      亚非会议的重要目的，是为了促进亚非各国间的亲善和合作，为了探讨和促进共同的利益，为了建立和增进友好和睦邻关系。这是符合这一地区国家和人民的广泛愿望的，也是完全符合联合国宪章的宗旨和精神的。尽管这一地区各国的社会制度和具体情况有很大的不同，许多国家间的关系也还存在着不正常状态，但是，共同的历史、维护和争取和平独立以及改善落后经济状态的共同愿望，使大家能够在一起讨论共同有关的重大问题，从而有助于扩大各方面的接触和联系，以便消除外来因素所强加的疑惧和误解。这一地区的许多国家之间的和平共处和友好合作关系，正在建立和发展，谅解和互信的气氛正在增长和扩大。中印、中缅以及中国同印度尼西亚之间友好关系的增进，印度和埃及友好条约的缔结，越南民主共和国代表团最近访问印度和缅甸所产生的积极结果，都是很好的例证。
    今天，维护和争取独立的问题仍然是对亚非国家广大人民具有特别利害关系的问题。殖民主义势力仍然在亚非两洲很大的地区内存在着，那里的落后和贫穷的情况正在加剧，人民得不到享受自由的权利；同时，这个势力还正在企图扩大阵地，剥夺更多的国家的民族主权。种族主义的野蛮罪行还在继续。在南非，占人口多数的非洲人、印度人、中国人和其他有色人种，遭受着非人道的歧视和迫害。殖民主义的残酷统治，阻挠着亚非广大地区的复兴，并成为恢复各国正常关系的严重的障碍。亚非各国人民不能容忍这种情况继续存在下去。已经取得了独立自由的国家决不肯再丢掉它们的独立。正在争取民族独立和反对种族歧视的爱国者的斗争受到亚非各国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的支持。结束殖民主义在亚非地区的统治，这是亚非各国人民的一致呼声。
  在亚非地区，建立和发展经济合作和文化交流的愿望，日益迫切。我们这一地区拥有丰富的资源，勤劳的人民，和光荣的文化遗产。如果没有外来的剥削、干涉和阻挠，早就有了无限的繁荣发展。这几年来，一些独立国家的经济情况已有很大的改善，文化生活开始重新活跃，同时它们之间的互助和合作也有了显著的开展。这是十分鼓舞人心的情景。但为了这一地区获得充分和完全的复兴，就必须继续打破外国的垄断和束缚，争取在平等互利的基础上进行合作，促进交流。目前强加在亚非许多国家身上的封锁禁运政策，和破坏航行自由和商业往来的海盗行为，正在遭到越来越强烈的反对。亚非国家和各国人民为了繁荣和幸福的前途的斗争，是势不可当的。
      亚非国家争取友好合作、维护独立自由的斗争，日益成为保卫和平、反对战争的强大力量。亚非人民是热爱和平的。这一地区在过去两次世界大战中遭受到的严重灾害，使他们记忆犹新。正在重建自己的新生活的国家，特别懂得和平的可贵。我们的共同利益，不是对立、分裂和战争，而是和平。印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约曾说：“我们希望亚非会议将开始人类致力于实现世界和平的活动历史的新的一章”。缅甸总理吴努也说，亚非会议是为了便利相互了解，扩大和平地区。那些硬说摆脱了民族压迫和奴役、获得了自由解放的国家和人民，会抱有所谓压迫和奴役其他民族的企图的诬蔑和挑拨言论，是注定要破产的。不受这些谎言的罗网陷害的国家越来越多了。和平共处五项原则的确立，使和平地区正在扩大。全世界人民越来越看清，五项原则符合于联合国宪章，符合于人民的和平要求。亚非会议的召开，提供了一个良好的机会，来使不同社会制度的亚非国家实行和平共处，并对促进世界和平和安全作出贡献。
    必须指出，新的战争的危险仍在增长，亚非地区的和平和安全受到日益严重的威胁。美国正在企图加强东南亚条约组织，加紧拼凑中东侵略集团和东北亚联盟，扩大满布亚非地区的军事基地网，对亚非人民进行狂妄的原子战争威胁。同时，美国还在所谓“停火”的和平伪装下，加强在台湾和台湾海峡的军事部署，变本加厉地对中国实行战争挑衅。美国破坏日内瓦协议和朝鲜停战协定的阴谋活动，也使这一区域的局势日益紧张。美国这一切活动，显然是为了挑起新的战争，以达到它奴役亚非人民和全人类的目的。它敌视亚非会议的倡议和召开。它无所不用其极地进行种种挑拨和破坏活动，企图挑起纷争，使会议无所成就。紧赶在亚非会议之前，美国侵略集团竟勾结蒋介石卖国集团干出了谋杀我出席亚非会议代表团人员和中外新闻记者的可耻的国际政治阴谋。但美国侵略集团想借此来加剧紧张局势，破坏亚非会议的阴谋，是注定要失败的。
    亚非会议的胜利召开，表明了有着千百万人民支持的正义事业是打不倒的。会议发起国，科伦坡会议国家的贡献特别博得了亚非人民的赞扬。亚非各国人民和公正舆论普遍要求各国政府本着民族的利益和和平的利益，为亚非会议取得积极的结果而共同努力。一切对亚非会议所表示的善意、期望和信心，都是出于对持久和平和国际合作的忠诚和热爱，这是人类良知的真挚表现。亚非会议的强大的道义力量就在这里。
    中华人民共和国政府和人民全力支持亚非会议为友好合作维护和平而作的努力。周恩来总理在致印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约的复电中表示：“中华人民共和国政府同意亚非会议的目的，而且对于能够有机会同其他亚非国家一起为这些目的而努力，也感到荣幸。”这完全表达了六亿中国人民的心情。亚非会议的目的，符合我国维护世界和平和促进各国友好合作的外交政策。我国的和平外交政策，已在中华人民共和国宪法中固定了下来。中华人民共和国宪法序言说：“我国根据平等、互利、互相尊重主权和领土完整的原则同任何国家建立和发展外交关系的政策，已经获得成就，今后将继续贯彻。在国际事务中，我国坚定不移的方针是为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力。”我国以周恩来总理为首的政府代表团将本着这一外交政策，同亚非各国代表团在一起，全力争取亚非会议有所成就。中国人民完全支持我国代表团和其他各国代表团的这一努力。
