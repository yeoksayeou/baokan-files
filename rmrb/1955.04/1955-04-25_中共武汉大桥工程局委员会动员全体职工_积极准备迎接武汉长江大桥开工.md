The CPC Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau Committee held a meeting of party member representatives from April 14th to 19th to mobilize all party members and employees to actively prepare for the commencement of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction. The meeting pointed out that thanks to the efforts of all party members and employees and the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts over the past year, preparations for this year's bridge construction have been largely completed. This year, comprehensive construction will be carried out in Wuchang, Hanyang, the river center, bridge abutments, approach bridges, overpass bridges, and highway bridges, with a high degree of mechanization in the construction process. In order to accomplish the more arduous tasks ahead, the meeting criticized the ideological sentiments of pride, complacency, individualism, decentralism, and backward conservatism that are currently growing within the Party and among the employees. The meeting demanded that all party members strengthen planning management during the full commencement of the bridge construction, educate all employees to overcome formalism in planning management, overcome the phenomena of high costs, large waste, and frequent accidents in certain individual projects, make full use of mechanical equipment, and humbly learn from advanced Soviet experience. The meeting called on all party members to work diligently, unite all employees, overcome difficulties, master technology and professional knowledge, and strive to ensure that the Yangtze River Bridge is constructed on schedule and the 1955 plan is completed.

    中共武汉大桥工程局委员会动员全体职工
    积极准备迎接武汉长江大桥开工
    中共武汉大桥工程局委员会于四月十四日到十九日召开党员代表会议，动员全体党员和职工积极准备迎接武汉长江大桥开工。会议指出，过去一年来由于全体党员、全体职工的努力及苏联专家的热情帮助，已经为今年的大桥施工基本上完成了准备工作。今年将要在武昌、汉阳、江心、桥台、引桥、跨线桥、公路桥等方面进行全面施工，施工中的机械化程度很高。为了完成今后更艰巨的任务，会议对目前在党内和职工中滋长的骄傲自满、个人主义、分散主义、落后保守等思想情绪进行了批判。会议要求全体党员在大桥全面开工中，加强计划管理，并教育全体职工克服计划管理中的形式主义做法，克服某些单项工程中成本高、浪费大、事故多的现象，充分利用机械设备，并虚心学习苏联先进经验。会议号召全体党员要兢兢业业、团结全体职工、克服困难，掌握技术和业务知识，为保证长江大桥能按期施工、完成一九五五年计划而奋斗。
