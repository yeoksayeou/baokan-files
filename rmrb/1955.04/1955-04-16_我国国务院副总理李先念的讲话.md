Dear guests, comrades:

The Exhibition of Achievements of Ten Years of Socialist Construction in Czechoslovakia is opening today in Beijing, the capital of our country. On behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, I extend my heartfelt congratulations on the successful opening of the exhibition, and express my warm welcome to the Czechoslovak Government Delegation headed by Vice Premier Jankovcova and all the exhibition staff who have come to China.

Since the liberation of the Czechoslovak people, thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the selfless labor of the people throughout the country, and the unselfish assistance of the great Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia has achieved great success in developing its economy over the past decade. By 1954, Czechoslovakia's industrial production had already reached more than twice the pre-war level. In particular, the machine-building industry, the metallurgical industry and the electric power industry in heavy industry have developed rapidly. The exquisite exhibits at today's exhibition fully demonstrate the brilliant achievements of the Czechoslovak Republic in ten years of socialist construction, and also demonstrate the great superiority of the people's democratic system.

The profound friendship between the people of China and Czechoslovakia is constantly being consolidated and developed. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Czechoslovak Republic established a new fraternal diplomatic relationship with our country. For more than five years, we have been working closely together in politics, economy, culture and other fields, and we have been increasing this cooperation day by day. Since 1950, trade agreements have been signed annually between China and Czechoslovakia, and economic and trade relations have become increasingly close. On May 6, 1952, four agreements on cultural, postal, telecommunications and scientific and technological cooperation between China and Czechoslovakia were signed in Beijing. Today, the Czechoslovak Exhibition of Achievements of Ten Years of Socialist Construction, which is rich in content and large in scale, will unfold a beautiful picture of socialist construction before the Chinese people.

The reason why the friendship and cooperation between our two countries have been so consolidated and developed in more than five years is that this completely new relationship is based on the internationalism of Marx and Lenin. I am confident that this fraternal friendship and cooperation between us will continue to develop.

The Chinese people have been paying close attention to the remarkable achievements of the Czechoslovak Republic on the road of socialist construction. The Chinese people are well aware that the people of China and Czechoslovakia are both in the great struggle to defend world peace and oppose the war schemes of US imperialism. Therefore, every achievement of yours encourages the Chinese people. As the Chinese people are carrying out large-scale economic construction under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, the exhibition of Czechoslovakia's highly industrialized level will surely encourage the Chinese people once again and contribute to the development of China's socialist industrialization. We, the Chinese people, will unite more closely with the Czechoslovak people in the peace, democracy and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and redouble our efforts to learn from the advanced science and technology and production experience of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, and accelerate the construction of China into an advanced socialist industrialized country. We also sincerely wish the Czechoslovak people continued new victories in socialist construction. We are convinced that the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Czechoslovakia and the continuous growth of the national economies will greatly contribute to the cause of defending world peace headed by the Soviet Union.

Long live the friendly cooperation between the people of China and Czechoslovakia!
Long live the world peace, democracy and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    我国国务院副总理李先念的讲话亲爱的来宾们、同志们：
    捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会今天在我国首都——北京开幕了。我代表中华人民共和国政府，衷心地祝贺展览会的胜利开幕，并向以扬科夫卓娃副总理为首的捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团及全体展览工作人员的来到中国，表示热烈的欢迎。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民解放以来，由于捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导，全国人民的忘我的劳动，伟大的苏联的大公无私的援助，十年来在发展经济方面获得了巨大的成就。到一九五四年，捷克斯洛伐克的工业生产已经达到战前水平的二倍以上。特别在重工业方面的机器制造业、冶金工业和电力工业有了迅速的发展。在今天这个展览会上的各种精湛的展览品就充分地表现了捷克斯洛伐克共和国十年社会主义建设的辉煌成就，同时也表现了人民民主制度的极大优越性。
    中捷两国人民的深厚友谊，是不断地在巩固和发展。在中华人民共和国宣告成立以后，捷克斯洛伐克共和国就与我国建立了兄弟般的新的外交关系。五年多来，我们在政治、经济、文化等各方面始终是亲密地合作着，并且日益增进。从一九五○年起中捷两国之间每年签有贸易协定，经济贸易关系日益密切。一九五二年五月六日在北京签定了中捷文化、邮政、电信及科学技术合作等四个协定。而今天内容丰富、规模宏大的捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会，又将在中国人民面前展开一幅社会主义建设的美景。
    我们两国之间的友谊与合作，在五年多的时间中，所以能够得到这样的巩固与发展，是因为我们这种完全新的关系是建立在马克思和列宁的国际主义基础之上的。我确信，我们这种兄弟般的亲密友谊与合作将会继续发展下去。
    中国人民一直怀着关切的心情，注视着捷克斯洛伐克共和国在社会主义建设道路上的卓越成就。中国人民清楚地知道，中捷两国人民是同处在保卫世界和平、反对美帝国主义战争阴谋的伟大斗争中。因此，你们每一个成就都鼓舞着中国人民。当中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，正进行着大规模经济建设的时候，捷克斯洛伐克高度工业水平展览会的展出必然会又一次地鼓舞中国人民，并有助于中国社会主义工业化的发展。我们中国人民将和捷克斯洛伐克人民更紧密地团结在以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营里，加倍努力学习苏联及其他兄弟国家先进的科学技术和生产经验，加速把中国建设成一个先进的社会主义工业化的国家。我们也亲切地预祝捷克斯洛伐克人民在社会主义建设中继续获得新的胜利。我们深信中捷两国人民兄弟般的友谊和国民经济的不断增涨，必将大大有助于以苏联为首的保卫世界和平的事业。
    中捷两国人民友好合作万岁！
    以苏联为首的世界和平民主社会主义阵营万岁！
