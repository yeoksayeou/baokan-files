Adhering to the principle that those who should be supplied must be supplied, those who should be supplied less should be supplied less, and those who should not be supplied must not be supplied, is a principle that must be followed in the work of unified grain purchase and sales. Currently, many regions are rectifying grain unified purchase and sales work according to this principle. However, during the rectification process, certain deviations have occurred in some areas and must be corrected. Some grassroots cadres believe that rectifying grain unified purchase and sales work means increasing the grain supply. As long as more grain is supplied, the problem will be solved. Under the control of this idea, they issue supply certificates indiscriminately without considering the actual needs of farmers. Some cadres even adopt a completely irresponsible method, preparing blank slips with pre-stamped seals and distributing them to farmers who request grain supply, allowing the farmers to fill in the amount of grain to be purchased themselves. In this way, the grain supply quota is not rationally reduced, but artificially inflated.

This kind of seriously irresponsible practice is simply treating the country's grain as a child's play and is a crime against the country. Some farmers who do not lack grain request grain supply from the state, some because they do not understand the policy of unified purchase and sales, and some because they want to take advantage of the state. Accommodating them by increasing the supply can only mislead those who do not understand the policy and make those who want to take advantage of the situation more demanding. This is by no means a way to raise farmers' awareness. The result of this will be to expand the country's supply quota indefinitely, waste the country's most valuable grain resources, and it is unimaginable if this continues. This wrong method must be stopped immediately, and the excess grain that has been issued must be recovered through appropriate means. In the process of carrying out this work, the reasons must be clearly explained to the farmers to avoid causing new misunderstandings among the farmers.

Is it necessary for the state to increase the supply to solve the grain problem in rural areas? Of course not. In order to solve the problem of grain supply in rural areas, on the one hand, the state's grain should be used rationally, and on the other hand, the adjustment of grain among farmers should be organized. There are still many well-to-do farmers in rural areas who have surplus grain, but because they are afraid of "showing their wealth", they are unwilling to sell or adjust with others. As long as these people with surplus grain are given good persuasion and education to eliminate their concerns and confidently sell their grain to the national grain market, many problems can be solved. However, many cadres still underestimate the role of the national grain market, and some counties have not even restored a national grain market, which is very bad. Facts have repeatedly proved that where the national grain market is well-managed, it can, to a certain extent, alleviate the situation in which grain sales increase unreasonably and drastically; therefore, considerable efforts must be made to restore the grain market that can be restored.

    坚持原则，合理供应
    泊微
    该供应者一定供应，该少供应者就少供应，不该供应者一定不供应，这是在粮食统销工作中必须遵循的原则。现在许多地区正在根据这个原则，整顿粮食统销工作。但在整顿过程中，某些地区又发生了某些偏向，必须加以纠正。有些基层干部认为，整顿粮食统销工作，就是增加粮食供应量，只要供应的粮食多了，问题就解决了。在这种思想支配下，他们就不问农民的实际需要，滥发供应证；有些干部甚至采取了一种完全不负责的方法，准备下盖好印章的空白条子，发给要求供应粮食的农民，由农民自己填写购粮数量。这样，粮食供应指标就不是合理地压缩，而是人为地膨胀起来了。
    这种严重的不负责任的作法，简直是以国家的粮食做儿戏，是对国家犯罪的行为。有些农民不缺粮食而要求国家供应粮食，有的是因为不懂得统销政策，有的是想占国家的便宜。用增加供应的办法迁就他们，只能使不懂政策的人发生错觉，使想占便宜的人更加得寸进尺，这绝不是提高农民觉悟的办法。这样作的结果，就会无限制地扩大国家的供应指标，浪费国家最宝贵的粮食资源，长此下去，是不可设想的。这种错误的方法必须立即停止，已经发出的过多的粮食，要通过适当的方式收回来。在进行这个工作的过程中，一定要把道理对农民讲清楚，免得使农民发生新的误解。
    解决农村的粮食问题，是不是非要国家增加供应量不可呢？当然不是这样的。为了解决农村粮食供应问题，一方面要合理地使用国家的粮食，一方面要组织农民中间的粮食调剂。现在农村里还有不少富裕农民存有余粮，但因为怕“露富”，不愿出卖或跟别人调剂。只要向这些有余粮的人很好地进行说服教育，使他们消除顾虑，放心地把粮食拿到国家粮食市场去卖，就能解决很多问题。但是不少干部还轻视国家粮食市场的作用，有些县一个国家粮食市场也没有恢复，这是很不好的。事实一再证明，凡是国家粮食市场办得好的地方，就能够在一定程度上缓和粮食销量不合理地大量增加的局面；因此，一定要用相当的力量，把可以恢复的粮食市场恢复起来。
