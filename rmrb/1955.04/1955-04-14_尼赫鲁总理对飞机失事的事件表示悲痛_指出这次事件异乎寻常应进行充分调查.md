Xinhua News Agency, April 13th: According to the Indian Information Service, Prime Minister Nehru, in a telegram to relevant parties, expressed his deepest sympathy and grief over the Indian International Airways plane crash on April 11th, which carried members of the Chinese delegation and other passengers.

In his telegram, Prime Minister Nehru said that he was deeply shocked when he first learned of the disaster on the evening of April 11th. Such a terrible disaster would be very distressing at any time. He believed that this time, it was particularly painful and sad because the plane was carrying members of the Chinese delegation attending the Bandung Conference.

Prime Minister Nehru said: "This disaster has some very unusual characteristics. Ten minutes before the plane crashed into the sea, we received a normal telegram from the plane. Something must have happened suddenly shortly thereafter. A full investigation must be conducted into all of this."

In a press release issued on the evening of April 12th, the Indian government said that they would conduct a full investigation into the cause of the disaster.

    新华社十三日讯　据印度新闻处报道，尼赫鲁总理在致有关方面的电报中对四月十一日印度国际航空公司载着中国代表团人员和其他乘客的飞机失事的事件表示最深切的同情和悲痛。
    尼赫鲁总理在电报中说，他当初获悉四月十一日傍晚的灾祸时深为震惊。在任何时候，这种可怕的灾祸都会非常令人痛苦的。他认为，在这一次，由于飞机载的是一部分出席万隆会议的中国代表团团员，所以特别令人痛苦和悲哀。
    尼赫鲁总理说：“这次灾祸有着某些十分异乎寻常的特点。在飞机坠入海中之前十分钟，我们还接到了飞机上发来的正常电报。过后不久一定突然发生了什么事。对于这一切必须进行充分的调查。”
    印度政府在四月十二日傍晚发布的新闻公报中说，他们将对生成灾祸的原因进行充分调查。
