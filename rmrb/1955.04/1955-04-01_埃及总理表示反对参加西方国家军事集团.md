Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 30th. TASS reports: Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser, on the 28th, delivered a speech at the Military Academy addressing the fundamental principles of the current Egyptian government's domestic and foreign policies.

According to the "Republic" newspaper, the foreign policy section of Nasser's speech addressed the situation created in the Middle East countries due to the attempts by Western countries to pull Arab countries into their military blocs. He emphasized that defending Arab countries is entirely a matter for the Arab countries themselves. The Prime Minister said, "If we are talking about joining a defense bloc to deal with any foreign threat, then we should not forget that this would bring the danger of establishing some form of foreign rule, which is fundamentally against our policy."

Nasser concluded by condemning the policies of the Iraqi government, which colluded with Turkey and "threw itself into the arms of Western countries."

    埃及总理表示反对参加西方国家军事集团
    新华社三十日讯　塔斯社开罗二十九日讯：埃及总理纳赛尔二十八日在军事学院就目前埃及政府的内政和外交政策的基本原则问题发表演说。
    据“共和国报”报道，纳赛尔演说中的外交政策部分，谈到由于西方国家企图把阿拉伯国家拉进它们的军事集团而在中东国家所造成的局势。他着重指出，保卫阿拉伯国家完全是阿拉伯国家自己的事情。总理说，“如果说要为了对付任何外国威胁而加入防御集团，那末我们不应当忘记，这会带来建立某一种形式的外国统治的危险，而这是根本违反我国政策的。”
    纳赛尔最后谴责同土耳其勾结并且“投入西方国家怀抱”的伊拉克政府的政策。
