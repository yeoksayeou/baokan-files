Xinhua News Agency, April 6th dispatch from New York: TASS, New York – On April 4th, a rally was held in New York to discuss the struggle for peaceful coexistence between countries with different political systems. Prominent political commentator Albert Kahn, social figure Eslanda Goode Robeson, and Protestant pastor Forbes spoke at the meeting.

    Forbes particularly emphasized the harm of the U.S. authorities prohibiting and destroying books that truthfully depict life in the Soviet Union and China. Eslanda Goode Robeson spoke in detail about the issues in Asia and the Asian people's struggle for peace and independence, and exposed the conspiracy of the reactionaries of the United States, Britain, and France to obstruct this struggle by organizing military blocs. Finally, she called for the struggle to achieve peaceful coexistence between all countries. In his speech, Albert Kahn exposed the anti-peace conspiracy being carried out by groups in the United States who dream of profiting from new wars.

    Xinhua News Agency, April 6th dispatch from New York: According to the "Daily Worker" newspaper, the U.S. Labor Party held a rally in New York in late March to fight for peace, oppose the rearmament of West Germany, and oppose the threat of atomic war. Approximately 2,500 people attended the rally.

    United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America leader, James Ustus Nixon spoke at the meeting, emphasizing that the American working class's struggle for peace is closely linked to the struggle for the workers' own rights. He said that without ending the Cold War and establishing peaceful relations between major powers, none of the goals of the American labor movement can be firmly achieved. He pointed out that the Cold War policy pursued by the U.S. government and the reactionary politics implemented domestically are inseparable and must be stopped simultaneously. He called on American workers to unite with workers from all countries to fight against the rearmament of West Germany.

    Labor Party leader Ingersoll stressed in her speech the need to oppose the U.S. government's policy of reviving German militarism and to oppose the threat of atomic war. She said that as long as we struggle, peace can be in our hands.

    New York Labor Party leader Bavi said that he firmly believes that the upcoming Asian-African Conference in Bandung will express the people's will for peace.

    Xinhua News Agency, April 5th dispatch from New York: Fourteen American Christian leaders jointly wrote a letter to President Eisenhower on the 2nd, stating that they are "deeply disturbed by the gradual trend towards war that exists in Washington" and demanded that this trend be stopped.

    These fourteen bishops, pastors, religious publication editors, and lay religious leaders from various Christian denominations criticized the policy advocating launching a "total war and the use of atomic bombs." They said in their letter that this irresponsible policy would make the United States be regarded by the world as a brazen aggressor. They pointed out, "The Christian conscience of millions of upright Americans can never tolerate such actions."

    They opposed the United States launching a military adventure against China to protect Chiang Kai-shek. The letter said, "We believe that risking a worldwide atomic war for the sake of Chiang Kai-shek's prestige is not only a foolish practice, but also the greatest crime."
