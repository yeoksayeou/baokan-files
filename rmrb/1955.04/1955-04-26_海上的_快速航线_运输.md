    The "Fast Route" Transportation on the Sea
    Liu Deqiang
    In order to ensure the timely supply of industrial coal to Shanghai, the Shanghai Maritime Administration of the Ministry of Communications and the Shanghai and Qinhuangdao Port Administrations have learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union's "fast route" maritime transportation. Since August of last year, they have officially opened the "Shanghai (申) - Qinhuangdao (秦) - Shanghai (申) Fast Regular Coal Transportation Route."

    This "fast route" was established on the basis of fixing dockworkers at ports, determining standard berthing and loading/unloading times for ships day and night, and standardizing the types of goods. The main measure of this "fast route" is to organize regular routes in the Soviet style, whereby the shipping company dispatches specialized ships with suitable performance based on the type of goods and port conditions, mainly transporting coal back and forth between the Shanghai and Qinhuangdao ports on a regular basis. The two ports of Shanghai and Qinhuangdao fix ship berths, on-site management personnel, and types of work based on ship performance, technical equipment conditions, and cargo storage yards, specifically responsible for the loading and unloading work of "fast route" ships. At the same time, both the shipping company and the port have separately stipulated indicators such as the time for ships to travel loaded and empty, as well as the berthing and loading/unloading time of ships in port, based on the average advanced quotas, and compiled "Fast Route Ship Operation Charts" on a monthly basis to guide "fast route" transportation.

    Since the establishment of this "fast route," the fixing of routes, ships, docks, storage yards, and stevedores to transport fixed goods has enabled both the shipping company and the port to deeply familiarize themselves with ship performance and loading/unloading equipment in their actual work, thus closely combining the ship operation charts with the single-ship operation plans of the ports, making transportation work more planned and rhythmic. In the short period of the third quarter of last year, the initial results of the "fast route" have already been shown. Both the ship turnover efficiency and the port loading and unloading operation shift efficiency have significantly improved compared to before the implementation of the "fast route." Taking the "Peace No. 1" ship as an example, the coal loading efficiency at Qinhuangdao Port increased from an average of 400 tons per hour to 445 tons per hour, and the coal loading efficiency per shift increased from 23.44 tons to 24.95 tons. The maximum coal unloading efficiency per shift at Shanghai Port increased from 28.11 tons to 33.88 tons. Due to the improvement of loading and unloading efficiency, the total berthing time of ships in port has also been shortened accordingly. The total berthing time of the "Peace No. 1" ship at Qinhuangdao Port was shortened from 25 hours and 40 minutes to 20 hours and 33 minutes, and the total berthing time at Shanghai Port was shortened from 40 hours to 32 hours. The ship's navigation rate increased from 44 percent to 60 percent. The ship turnover rate has also been effectively accelerated. Based on a preliminary estimate of the "Peace No. 1" ship alone, at least four additional round trips between Qinhuangdao and Shanghai can be added throughout the year, transporting more than 34,000 tons of coal and accumulating more than 200,000 yuan in wealth for the country.

    The implementation of "fast route" transportation has a great impact on improving the management of ports and shipping. Because the implementation of "fast route" transportation requires both the shipping company and the port to strengthen the planning of their work, actively cooperate with each other, and continuously improve the quality of ship time-sharing operation charts and port single-ship operation plans on the basis of advanced quotas, ensuring seamless connection and rhythmic production. In the various operation processes, it is also necessary to strictly control each production procedure to make it closely linked. Otherwise, the disconnection of any production procedure on either side will affect the realization of the plan. This has improved the level of ship and port operation planning, making the content of the plan gradually become more comprehensive and detailed. For example, when formulating loading and unloading operation plans, Qinhuangdao Port carefully calculated and arranged the number of trains that can be accommodated in the ship's hold, the number of cars per train, the number of scoops per train, and the time required for each hook of goods, and stipulated specific indicators, so that the accuracy of the single-ship operation plan increased from 89.8 percent to 94.9 percent, greatly shortening the ship's berthing time in port and improving the turnover rate.

    Secondly, the "fast route" fixes the types of work and labor organization, thus facilitating the implementation of the personal responsibility system, implementing technical operating procedures, improving labor organization according to labor capacity and technical expertise, improving workers' operational proficiency, and improving operating methods and production tools. For example, when loading and unloading "fast route" ships, stevedores at Shanghai Port created many advanced operating methods from accumulated experience, such as "lifting and hooking," "arc-shaped hook walking," "automatic hook release," and "chute coal unloading." Qinhuangdao Port improved the labor allocation system and implemented contract-based supply of ships, which not only saves manpower, but also ensures that the ship's draft difference is accurately calculated due to personal responsibility, ensuring that the ship does not "lean," and that the hold is not "blocked," so that the ship's load rate is correspondingly increased. At the same time, the "fast route" promotes the entire work, integrating the past fifteen advanced operating methods into a complete set of advanced coal loading methods, effectively improving loading and unloading efficiency.

    The implementation of the "fast route" has also strengthened many weak links in production. For example, in the past, when ships unloaded coal at Shanghai Port, the lack of coordination between the cargo owner department and the barge transportation often resulted in barge disconnection, causing very serious losses to workers due to work stoppages. This weak link directly threatened the implementation of "fast route" transportation. To this end, Shanghai Port strengthened contact with the cargo owner department, analyzed the causes of disconnection, and helped improve barge scheduling, basically solving the problem of barge disconnection and reducing the loss of worker downtime.

    In addition, organizing ship operations according to the "fast route" can also simplify the preparation of transportation plans, avoid the complicated procedures of reallocating ships every month, and ensure the regularization of cargo transportation and the specialization of transportation tasks.

    The "fast route" is an advanced method of organizing ship operations in the Soviet Union. The success of opening this "fast route" transportation fully demonstrates the superiority of the advanced experience of maritime transportation in the Soviet Union. At the same time, it also proves that the potential power of maritime transportation is still very strong, waiting for the water transport department to further organize, develop, and utilize all existing transportation equipment to make up for the shortage of transportation tools, continue to open new "fast routes," and serve the needs of national industrialization and people's lives more and better.

    海上的“快速航线”运输
    刘德强
    交通部上海海运管理局和上海、秦皇岛两个港务管理局，为了保证上海市工业用煤能够按时供应，学习了苏联海上“快速航线”运输的先进经验，自去年八月开始，正式开辟了“申（上海）秦（秦皇岛）申（上海）快速正规煤运航线”。
    这条“快速航线”是在固定港湾装卸工人、确定船舶在港昼夜停泊装卸标准时间和货物的品种定型等基础上建立起来的。这条“快速航线”的主要措施，就是按照苏联组织正规航线的形式，由船方根据货物的品种和港口条件，调派性能适合的专船，以运煤为主按期往返于申秦两港之间；申秦两港根据船舶性能、技术设备条件和货物堆场等情况，来固定船舶泊位、现场管理人员和工种，专门负责“快速航线”船舶的装卸工作；同时，船港双方又分别在平均先进定额的基础上，规定了船舶重航和空驶的时间以及船舶在港停泊装卸时间等指标，按月编制“快速航线船舶运行图表”来指导“快速航线”运输。
    这条“快速航线”建立以来，由于固定了航线、船舶、码头、堆场和装卸工人来运输固定的货物，就使船港双方都能在实际工作中深入熟习船舶性能和装卸设备，从而把船舶的运行图表和港湾的单船作业计划紧密地结合起来，使运输工作更加有计划有节奏地进行。在去年第三季度的短短时间中，已显示出“快速航线”的初步成果。无论船舶周转效率或港湾装卸作业的工班效率，都较推行
  “快速航线”以前有显著提高。以“和平一号”轮为例，在秦皇岛港装煤效率，由平均每小时四百吨提高到每小时四百四十五吨，每工班装煤效率由二十三点四四吨提高到二十四点九五吨。上海港最高工班卸煤效率由二十八点一一吨提高到三十三点八八吨。由于装卸效率的提高，船舶在港总停泊时间也相应缩短。“和平一号”轮在秦皇岛港总停泊时间由二十五小时四十分缩短到二十小时三十三分，在上海港总停泊时间由四十小时缩短到三十二小时，船舶航行率由百分之四十四提高到百分之六十。而船舶周转率也有效地加速了。仅以“和平一号”轮作初步估计，全年至少可增加四个秦申往复航行次数，多运三万四千多吨煤，为国家积累二十余万元的财富。
    实行“快速航线”运输对改进港口和航运的管理有很大的作用。因为实行“快速航线”运输，就要求船港双方都必须加强工作的计划性，彼此主动配合，并在先进的定额基础上，不断提高船舶分时运行图表与港口单船作业计划的质量，保证环环相接，进行有节奏的生产。在各项作业过程中，也必须严格控制每个生产程序，使之紧密衔接，否则任何一方任何一个生产程序的脱节，都会影响计划的实现。这样就提高了船港编制作业计划的水平，使计划的内容逐步趋向全面、细致。例如秦皇岛港在制定装卸作业计划时，对船舱可容纳的列车趟数，每趟车的车皮数，每趟车的兜数，每钩货物所需用的时间，都作了仔细的计算和安排，规定出具体指标，使单船作业计划的准确程度，由百分之八十九点八提高到百分之九十四点九，大大缩短了船舶在港停泊时间，提高了周转率。
    其次，“快速航线”固定了工种和劳动组织，因而便于推行专人负责制，贯彻技术操作规程，按劳动能力和技术特长改进劳动组织，提高工人操作的熟练程度，改进操作方法和生产工具。如上海港装卸工人在装卸“快速航线”船舶时，从积累的经验中，创造了“提啳挂钩”、“弧形走钩”、“自动摘钩”、“滑板卸煤”等许多先进的操作方法。秦皇岛港改善了配工制度，实行包垛供船，不仅节省人力，更由于专人负责，准确地计算了船舶吃水差，保证船舶不“偏杆”，挖舱不“堵眼”，使船舶载重率相应提高。同时，由于“快速航线”推动整个工作，把过去十五种先进的操作方法综合成为一套完整的先进的装煤法，有效地提高了装卸效率。
    推行“快速航线”还加强了许多生产上的薄弱环节。比如过去轮船在上海港卸煤时，由于货主部门接运驳船配合不够，经常发生驳船脱档，使工人停工的损失非常严重，这一薄弱环节直接威胁
  “快速航线”运输的推行。为此，上海港即加强同货主部门的联系，分析脱档原因，帮助改进了驳船调度工作，基本上解决了驳船脱档的问题，减少了工人停工的损失。
    另外，按照“快速航线”来组织船舶运行，还可以使运输计划的编制趋向简便，避免每月重新分配船舶的繁杂手续，保证货物运输的正规化和运输任务的专业化。
    “快速航线”是苏联组织船舶运行的先进方法，从开辟这一“快速航线”运输的成功，充分说明了苏联这一海上运输的先进经验的优越性。同时也证实海上运输的潜在力量还十分雄厚，有待于水运部门进一步地组织发挥和运用现有一切运输设备，弥补运输工具的不足，继续开辟新的“快速航线”，更多更好地为国家工业化和人民生活的需要服务。
