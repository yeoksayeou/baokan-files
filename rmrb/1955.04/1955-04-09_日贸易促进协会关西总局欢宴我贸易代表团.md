Xinhua News Agency, Osaka, April 8th. The Japan International Trade Promotion Association's Kansai Headquarters hosted a banquet on the evening of the 7th to welcome the Chinese Trade Delegation visiting Japan.

Among those attending the welcome banquet from the Japanese side were Shozo Murata, President of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, Masao Tajima, Vice President, Kazutaro Sugano, Director-General of the Kansai Headquarters, and 240 representatives from prominent business circles in Kansai.

Masao Tajima, Vice President of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the Kansai business community. He mentioned that due to Japanese restrictions on exports, hardware, machinery, and other products that used to hold an important position in Japanese exports could not be exported, resulting in a significant reduction in Japanese exports to China. He said that despite these obstacles, Sino-Japanese trade had seen some recovery in 1954. This shows that Sino-Japanese trade actually possesses unstoppable conditions for development. In the future, in order to develop Sino-Japanese trade, it is necessary to vigorously eliminate Japanese restrictions on exports.

In his speech, delegation leader Lei Renmin emphasized China's willingness to establish a long-term, stable, and mutually supplying trade relationship with Japan. He said that China is still engaged in large-scale economic construction, and all production, imports, and exports are planned, especially the supply of means of production and raw materials. For example, if the Japanese side can establish a stable and long-term supply relationship with China for hardware, ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, electrical machinery, machinery, ships, chemicals, Western medicine, fertilizers, etc. that China needs, China is also prepared to export to Japan various raw materials and products that it once exported in large quantities and are extremely needed by Japan, including soybeans, rice, coal, industrial salt, iron sand, pig iron, and other minerals, livestock products, native products, and food products. Lei Renmin pointed out that establishing such a long-term and stable relationship is beneficial to the economies of both sides.

After the meeting, the Chinese trade delegation held a forum with representatives of Kansai business circles who attended.

    日贸易促进协会关西总局欢宴我贸易代表团
    新华社大阪八日电　日本国际贸易促进协会关西总局七日晚举行宴会欢迎中国访问日本贸易代表团。
    日本方面出席欢迎宴会的有日本国际贸易促进协会会长村田省藏、副会长田岛正雄、关西总局长菅野和太郎以及关西著名企业界代表共二百四十人。
    日本国际贸易促进协会副会长田岛正雄代表关西工商界致欢迎词。他谈到由于日本方面限制输出，过去在日本出口物资中占很重要地位的五金、机械等产品都不能出口，使得日本向中国的输出大量减少。他说，尽管有这样的障碍，但在一九五四年，中日贸易又有了些恢复。由此可见，中日贸易在实际上是具有不可阻止的发展条件的。今后为了发展中日贸易，必须大力排除日本方面对输出的限制。
    雷任民团长在致词中，着重说明了中国愿同日本建立一个长期的稳定的相互供应的贸易关系。他说，中国还在进行大规模的经济建设，一切生产和进出口都是有计划性的，特别是生产资料和原料的供应。比如中国所需要的五金、黑色金属、有色金属、电机、机械、船舶、化工、西药、肥料等，如果日本方面能够和中国建立稳定的长期的供应关系，中国也准备向日本输出过去曾经大量输出的并为日本所极需要的各类原料及各种产品，包括大豆、大米、煤、工业用盐、铁砂、生铁及其他矿产、畜产、土产、食品等。雷任民指出，建立这种长期的稳定的关系对双方经济是有利的。
    会后中国贸易代表团和到会的关西企业界代表举行了座谈。
