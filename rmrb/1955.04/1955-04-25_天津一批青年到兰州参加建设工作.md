The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Lanzhou Municipal Committee, and the preparatory committee of the Gansu Provincial Youth Federation and other units held a welcome party on the 20th. Liang Chaorong, member of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and deputy secretary of the Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, spoke at the meeting, welcoming them to actively participate in the construction work of Gansu Province. At the meeting, Lanzhou youth performed wonderful musical and dance programs for them.
    The more than 200 young people who came to Gansu this time are all junior high school graduates from Tianjin. In their studies, they realized the importance of building up the interior of the motherland and enthusiastically requested to go to the interior. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and other units helped them realize this beautiful wish. Now, they are about to embark on their jobs. (Our correspondent in Lanzhou)

    天津一批青年到兰州参加建设工作
    天津第一批到甘肃参加建设的青年，十八日到达兰州市，受到当地人民的热烈欢迎。中国新民主主义青年团甘肃省委员会和兰州市委员会、甘肃省民主青年联合会筹委会等单位特在二十日举行了欢迎晚会。甘肃省团委会委员、兰州市团委副书记梁朝荣在会上讲话，欢迎他们积极参加甘肃省的建设工作。会上，兰州市青年为他们演出了精采的音乐舞蹈节目。
    这次到甘肃的二百多青年都是天津市的初中毕业学生。在学习中他们认识到建设祖国内地的重要性，热情地要求到内地去。天津市团委等单位帮助他们实现了这一美好愿望。现在，他们即将走上工作岗位。　（本报驻兰州记者）
