    Anshan Iron and Steel basic construction this year will further implement mechanization. In earth excavation, transportation, hoisting, and concrete manufacturing, the amount of work using mechanical construction will increase by about two times compared to last year. Several hundred new machines manufactured in the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries will be used in this year's construction. This further implementation of mechanized construction is an important guarantee that Anshan Iron and Steel will be able to complete a larger construction task than last year without increasing manpower or increasing the labor intensity of workers.
    The level of mechanization in earthwork construction at Anshan Iron and Steel's basic construction this year will be greatly improved compared to last year. Many tasks that were previously done manually will now be done by machines this year. For example, the work of digging soil to a depth of more than ten meters below ground will be carried out on the ground by a multi-shovel excavator operated by two workers. The excavator's bucket extends underground, rotating like a waterwheel, and can excavate 40 cubic meters of soil per hour. On the underground pipeline project that is about to begin, a trench excavator will be used to dig pipeline trenches. This machine is highly efficient, and as it slowly moves forward, a pipeline trench will appear behind it.
    The newly added new machinery will enable the degree of mechanization of hoisting and transportation work to reach more than 90% this year. A self-propelled trailer with a load capacity of 60 tons can transport large prefabricated components weighing more than 10 tons from the factory to remote locations. In the past, it was difficult to transport these large prefabricated components after they were manufactured in the factory. There is also a scraper, which can hold eight cubic meters of soil in one scoop, and the amount of soil it shovels and transports in one day is more than what five hundred people can do.
    The entire process of concrete mixing, transportation, pouring, and tamping will also be almost fully mechanized this year. On some construction sites that are far away from the concrete mixing plant, truck-mounted concrete mixers will be used to supply concrete. On the way to the construction site, the truck can turn the cement, sand, stone, and water loaded in the truck box into good concrete.
    In order to implement this large-scale mechanized construction measure, Anshan Iron and Steel has recently transferred more than 300 office workers and workers to specialize in learning to drive heavy construction machinery, so that they can learn the technology of independent driving in the shortest possible time. The construction department has also begun to rotate technical workers who master light machinery such as water pumps, air compressors, and concrete vibrators for training. The department responsible for construction organization design is designing the types of machinery needed and how to use them based on the nature of the project and the site conditions. In the basic construction general repair plant, the construction machinery worn out last year is being overhauled. In order to facilitate the powerful operation of the huge construction machinery, roads and bridges have begun to be repaired on the construction site, and lighting equipment has been installed. Currently, the frozen ground has just melted, and excavators, dump trucks, bulldozers, compactors and other machinery have begun to move.

### 鞍钢基本建设施工将进一步实行机械化

    鞍钢基本建设施工将进一步实行机械化
    鞍山今年基本建设的施工，将进一步实行机械化。在挖填土方、运输、起重、制造混凝土等工作中，使用机械施工的工作量将比去年增多两倍左右。有几百台苏联和人民民主国家制造的新的机械，将在今年的施工中使用。这一进一步实行机械化施工的措施，将是鞍钢今年在既不增加人力又不提高工人劳动强度的条件下，能够完成比去年更大的建设任务的重要保证。
    今年鞍钢基本建设中土方工程的施工机械化水平，将比去年提高很多。许多往年用人工干的活，今年也要用机械来干。如向地平面下十几公尺深处挖土的工作，就将由两个工人开动的多智式挖土机在地面上进行。挖土机的掘斗伸向地下，像水车一样旋转，每小时可以挖出四十多立方公尺的泥土。在即将动工的地下管道工程上，一种多斗式挖沟机将用来挖掘管道沟。这种机器效能高，随着它的徐徐开动，一条管道沟就会在它的后面出现。
    新增置的许多新式机械，将使今年起重和运输工作的机械化程度达到百分之九十以上。一种载重六十吨的自行拖车，可以把重十吨以上的大型预制构件从工厂里运送到远距离的地方去。过去这种大型的预制构件在工厂里制成后，运出来就很困难。还有一种铲运机，一掘斗就可以盛八立方公尺的土，它一天铲土和运土的数量要比五百个人干的还多。
    混凝土的搅拌、输送、浇灌和捣固的整个过程，今年也几乎要全部实行机械化。在一些离混凝土搅拌厂较远的工地上，将有汽车式混凝土搅拌机来供给混凝土。汽车在奔向工地途中，就能把装在车箱里的水泥、砂、石和水变成很好的混凝土了。
    为了实行这一大规模机械化施工的措施，鞍钢最近已经抽调了三百多名机关工作人员和工人专门学习驾驶重型施工机械，使他们在最短期间内学会独立驾驶的技术。施工部门并已开始轮训掌握水泵、空气压缩机、混凝土震动器等轻型机械的技术工人。负责作施工组织设计的部门，正在根据工程性质和工地情况，对需要使用的机械种类和使用方法加以设计。在基本建设总修理厂里，去年磨损的施工机械正在检修。为便于庞大的施工机械发挥威力，工地上已开始修整道路、桥梁，安置照明设备。目前，冻地刚刚融化，挖土机、自卸汽车、推土机、压实机等机械都已动作起来了。   （新华社）
