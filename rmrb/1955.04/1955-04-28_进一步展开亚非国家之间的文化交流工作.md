    Further Expand Cultural Exchange Work Between Asian and African Countries
    Zheng Zhenduo
    The regions of Asia and Africa are the cradles of world civilization. The earliest and most brilliant flowers of human civilization once bloomed in Egypt, in the Mesopotamian Plain, in India, and in China. They created glorious cultures and made great contributions to mankind. Let's take a few examples.
    More than 500,000 years ago, China was inhabited by "Peking Man," who could make stone tools and bone tools, and use fire. Later, there were "Ordos Man," "Upper Cave Man," and "Ziyang Man," whose cultures gradually progressed. By the late Neolithic Age, exquisite painted pottery and shiny black pottery were produced. The diverse patterns painted on the painted pottery prove the richness of the Chinese people's imagination during this period. The discovery of oracle bone script from the Yin Dynasty shows that 3,500 years ago, we already had a rich language of more than 3,000 characters. The excavation of Yin Dynasty ruins and tombs in Anyang, Zhengzhou, and other regions of Henan Province also proves the high degree of beauty in the architecture and other craft creations of this period. The production of bronzes, jade artifacts, and bone artifacts are its outstanding features. Jade sculptures of human figures and animals are vivid and exquisite works. Silk fabrics became a common raw material for clothing. Two thousand seven hundred years ago, we already used iron tools as means of production. The construction of the Great Wall, the construction of the Dujiangyan Irrigation System in Guanxian, Sichuan, and the excavation of the Zheng Guoqu Canal in Shaanxi were all large-scale constructions of national defense and water conservancy projects two thousand three to four hundred years ago. Literature, art, and philosophical thought also made many achievements during this period. The "Book of Songs" and Qu Yuan's works are well known, and the writings of Confucius, Lao Tzu, Zhuang Zhou, Mo Di, Mencius, Xun Qing, and Han Fei are equally well known. Achievements in astronomy and calendrical calculations, as well as the inventions of paper, printing, the compass, porcelain, and gunpowder, played a significant role in the development of human history.
    On the west bank of the lower reaches of the Nile, many pyramids and sphinxes carved from whole blocks of rock stand tall, marking that the Egyptians had a highly mature culture more than 4,800 years ago. The Egyptian people invented writing more than 700 years earlier than this. They made unforgettable contributions in astronomy, mathematics, medicine, architecture, painting, and the creation of poetry.
    The light of Indian culture once shone throughout Southeast Asia and other regions, and had a profound influence on the cultures of these regions. Through modern archaeological excavations, we know that India had highly accomplished architecture, handicrafts, and other arts as early as 5,000 years ago. The great epics "Mahabharata" and "Ramayana" are inexhaustible literary treasures. Brahmanism, Buddhism, and Islam have all left behind brilliant creations throughout India. The Brahman sculptures we see on Elephanta Island, in the Ellora Caves, Mahabalipuram, and Madurai are all admirable masterpieces. Buddhist sculptures, such as the lion capital of the stone pillars erected by Emperor Ashoka in the third century BC, the Ajanta cave paintings that were begun to be carved and painted on the walls a century later, and the sculptural works found in other Buddhist temples and ancient pagoda sites, all fill us with deep admiration. The Taj Mahal, built by Shah Jahan of the Mughal Dynasty, still stands sparkling white on the plains of Agra, attracting many people from all over the world to admire it every day.
    Persia established a large empire in the sixth century BC that included the Mesopotamian Plain. It conquered Phoenicia, Palestine, and Neo-Babylonia, inherited the cultural heritage of those countries, and brought them to all the places its military forces reached. This short-lived empire, like a shooting star, left behind many excellent works of art. Later, the poetry, novels, and paintings created by the Persian people also had a great influence in Asia and Africa.
    The cultures of Asian and African countries have influenced each other, and this cultural exchange and influence began very early. Indian Buddhism and Buddhist art were introduced to China, Japan, Burma, Thailand, and other Southeast Asian countries, and combined with the inherent art of those countries to produce many excellent creations. The immortal sculptures, statues, and murals of the Yungang, Longmen, Maijishan, and Dunhuang grottoes in China were created in this way. They have become a treasure trove of great artistic creations of which the Chinese people can be proud, and at the same time, they have become immortal examples marking Sino-Indian cultural exchange. Chinese silk, paper, porcelain, and other works of art were also spread to India and other Asian and African countries very early. Excellent early Chinese porcelain has been excavated from the ruins of ancient cities in India, Indonesia, and other countries. Chinese lacquerware was introduced to Korea 2,000 years ago. And the folding fan, which is widely used among the people in China today, was introduced from Japan and Korea. Many ancient Indian books, especially Buddhist classics, which have long been lost in India, are preserved in Chinese translations; now some scholars are working on translating them back. Many ancient Chinese books, which have been lost in China, are also preserved in Japan, and most of them have been and are being reprinted. The histories of Burma, Vietnam, Indonesia, Ceylon, Korea, Japan, and other countries are recorded in great detail in ancient Chinese books; in particular, the travelogues of Chinese Buddhist monks such as Faxian, Xuanzang, and Yijing have made important contributions to the study of the medieval history and geography of India. The "Annals of the Joseon Dynasty" of Korea and the "Dai Nam Veritable Records" of Vietnam (this book of the Nguyen Dynasty is still a manuscript and has not been printed), which record Chinese historical facts since the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (i.e., the Ming and Qing dynasties), are of great use to Chinese historians. Persian people became very popular guests in Chang'an during the Tang Dynasty. Li Xun, a poet of the Five Dynasties, was of Persian origin, and his works written in Chinese are still preserved in the "Anthology from Among the Flowers." As for the works written in Chinese by writers from Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and other countries, there are even more, and they could be written into a very thick catalog. Arabs resided in China in large numbers during the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties. Islam had a greater influence on Chinese culture, and it was first introduced by Arabs. In medicine, astronomy, mathematics, and food manufacturing techniques, the influence of Arabs and Indians was equally great. In "Important Principles of Food and Drink," a book compiled by people of the Yuan Dynasty, many of the methods of food production are traditional methods of Central Asia. All of this is sufficient to show that there have been frequent cultural exchanges between China and many countries in Asia and Africa, and between many countries in Asia and Africa themselves, since ancient times. They have culturally influenced each other, absorbed each other's strengths, and grown their own cultures. This means that there have been thousands of ties between the cultures of all Asian and African countries since ancient times, with mutual resonance and interconnectedness.
    Such close cultural relations were artificially severed after the rise of Western imperialists. Many Asian and African countries lost their sovereignty and became colonies or semi-colonies. At the same time, under conditions of cruel exploitation and oppression, it gradually became impossible to vigorously develop their own cultures. A small number of enslaved intellectuals even lost their national self-esteem, often "forsaking their ancestors" and despising or forgetting their own great and excellent cultural traditions. This is precisely one of the methods used by imperialists to consolidate their rule. Imperialism fears most the awakening of colonial or semi-colonial countries, and even more the mutual exchanges and influences between these countries; even commercial exchanges were cut off or isolated. They also sow discord and create disharmony or disputes between various countries or ethnic groups. This has resulted in a long period of separation and cultural obstruction between many Asian and African countries.
    With the end of the two world wars, the people of colonies and semi-colonies have successively awakened and fought more forcefully and bravely against imperialists for the freedom and independence of their countries. As a result, there is a new atmosphere in the Asian and African regions, and many new independent countries have emerged. Among these countries, one type is led by communist political parties, such as the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The other type is led by nationalists, such as India, Burma, Indonesia, and many other countries in Asia and Africa. Although all these two types of countries are new countries, most of them are ancient countries. The proud and excellent national cultural heritage has begun to restore its inherent brilliance. At the same time, these countries have also expressed the desire to restore the cultural exchanges between Asian and African countries that have been artificially interrupted.
    In recent years, some Asian and African countries have done a lot of work in this regard. From the mutual visits of cultural delegations and art delegations to the unfolding of exhibitions and various sports activities, it marks that the cultural exchange between these countries is expanding and becoming more frequent. Such cultural exchanges not only consolidate the friendship between each other, not only increase the understanding between the people of each other, but also greatly help to defend the peace of the Asian and African regions and the entire world. Now, the Asian-African Conference has expressed its great determination in its joint communique to further expand the friendship between Asian and African countries, strengthen cultural exchanges between each other, and defend the peace of the Asian and African regions and the world.
    In order to restore and develop cultural exchanges between many Asian and African countries, a lot of work needs to be done. First of all, there must be sufficient introductions about the history and culture between Asian and African countries. However, at present, even the preliminary introduction has not been done. To give an example. Some Asian and African countries do not know much about the face of China, about the work and life of the Chinese people. They often still hold on to the books that imperialists used to slander the Chinese people as help to understand China. When talking about Chinese farmers, they mention the characters in Pearl S. Buck's novels; when talking about Chinese intellectuals, they mention Lin Yutang's absurd works. They do not know that if you want to truly understand the Chinese people, those boring works of fiction will only cause misunderstandings. An Indian friend once told me that after contacting the people of New China, he realized how Pearl S. Buck's novels distorted the image of the Chinese people. It can be seen from this that the faster and more the introduction of history and culture between Asian and African countries is done, the better.
    Secondly, the creation of classical and modern literature and art should be translated and published in large quantities; specialized translation talents should be cultivated as quickly and as many as possible. These literary and artistic creations are the most concrete things to understand a country and its people. If we want to understand India, we must translate the Indian epics "Mahabharata" and "Ramayana," as well as many modern literary works written in Hindi, Bengali, Urdu, and Tamil. To understand Burma, Turkey, Egypt, and other countries, we must also translate their famous works as much and as quickly as possible.
    Finally, the mutual visits of sports groups, the mutual visits of cultural and art groups, and the regular holding of various exhibitions are also very necessary.
    We believe that after the Asian-African Conference, cultural exchanges between Asian and African countries will definitely be more consolidated and developed.

    进一步展开亚非国家之间的文化交流工作
    郑振铎
    亚洲和非洲地区乃是世界文明的摇篮。人类的最早的灿烂的文明花朵曾经在埃及、在美索不达米亚平原、在印度、在中国开放。它们曾经创造过光辉灿烂的文化，对人类作出了巨大的贡献。举几个例子来说吧。
    中国在五十多万年之前就住着称为“北京人”的真人，能够制造石器、骨器，会用火。其后，就有了像“河套人”、“山顶洞人”和“资阳人”，他们的文化逐渐地进步了。到了新石器时代的后期，就产生着精美的彩色陶器和光亮如漆的黑色陶器。彩色陶器上所绘画的多种多样的图案，证明了这时期中国人民想像力的丰富。殷代甲骨文字的发现，说明了在离今三千五百年前，我们已有了三千个以上的丰富的语言文字。河南省的安阳、郑州和其他地区殷代遗址和墓葬的发掘，也证明了这时期的建筑和其他工艺创作的高度的优美。青铜器、玉器和骨器的制作是其杰出的特色。玉雕的人像和动物是生动而精致的作品。丝织品成为很普遍的衣着的原料。在二千七百年前，我们已经使用铁器，作为生产工具。长城的建筑，四川灌县的都江堰的修筑，以及陕西郑国渠的开凿，都是二千三、四百年前的国防和水利工程的大建设。文学、艺术和哲学思想在这时期也有很多成就。“诗经”和屈原的作品是人所共知的，孔子、老子、庄周、墨翟、孟轲、荀卿和韩非等的著作，同样是人所共知的。在天文、历数方面的成就，以至纸张、印刷术、指南针、瓷器和火药的发明，在人类历史发展上是起了很大的作用的。
    在尼罗河下流的西岸，耸峙着许多金字塔和用整块岩石雕成的狮身人面兽，标志着埃及人在离今四千八百多年前就有了高度而且成熟的文化。埃及人民发明文字比这年代更早七百多年。在天文学、数学、医药、建筑和绘画、诗歌的创作等方面，都有令人难忘的贡献。
    印度的文化的光芒，曾经照射到整个东南亚洲和其他地区，而且对于这些地区的文化有着深厚的影响。经过近代的考古发掘工作，我们知道远在五千年前印度就有了高度成就的建筑、手工艺和其他艺术。大史诗“摩诃波拉他”和“拉马耶那”是汲取不尽的文学的大宝库。婆罗门教、佛教和伊斯兰教都在印度各地遗留下辉煌的创作。婆罗门教的雕刻，我们在象岛、爱罗拉石窟、摩诃波里普伦以及马杜拉所见的，都是令人敬佩的大作品。佛教的雕刻，像阿育王在公元前三世纪所建立的石柱的狮子柱头，后此一世纪就已经开凿起来和绘画在壁上的阿旃陀石窟的壁画，以及其他佛教寺庙和古塔的遗址所有的雕塑作品，都使我们深为钦佩。蒙兀儿王朝的沙琪汗所建筑的泰姬陵，至今还莹洁如新地矗立在阿格拉的平原之上，每天都招致了许多来自世界各地的人来瞻仰。
    波斯在公元前六世纪的时候，就建立了包括美索不达米亚平原在内的大帝国。它征服了腓尼基、巴力斯坦和后巴比伦，继承了那些国家的文化遗产，并把它们带到它兵力所到各地方去。这个像流星似的短命的大帝国，在艺术上遗留下了不少优秀的作品。之后，波斯人民所创作的诗歌、小说和绘画，在亚洲和非洲也还产生了很大的影响。
    亚洲和非洲国家的文化，是彼此之间相互影响着的，而且这种彼此之间的文化交流和影响，在很早的时候就开始了。印度的佛教和佛教艺术，传入了中国、日本、缅甸、泰国和其他东南亚国家，同那些国家的固有的艺术相结合，产生了很多优秀的创作。像中国的云岗、龙门、麦积山、敦煌诸石窟的不朽的雕刻、塑像和壁画，就是这样产生出来的。它们成为中国人民可骄傲的伟大的艺术创作的宝库，同时，也就成为标志中、印文化交流的不朽的例证。中国的丝绸、纸张、瓷器和其他艺术品，也很早就流传到印度和亚非其他国家去。很好的中国初期的瓷器，在印度、印度尼西亚和其他各国的古都市的遗址里，都曾被发掘出来。中国的漆器在离今两千年前就流传到朝鲜去。而中国今天，在人民之间广泛使用着的摺扇，则是从日本和朝鲜传来的。印度有许多古书，特别是佛教的经典著作，在印度已经早已失传了的，但在中国的译本里都还保存着；如今有若干学者，正在做转译回去的工作。中国有许多古书，在本土佚去了的，也在日本保存着，其中大多数已经并正在重印出来。缅甸、越南、印度尼西亚、锡兰、朝鲜、日本，还有其他国家的历史，在中国古书里都记载得很详细；特别是中国佛教僧侣们，像法显、玄奘、义净诸人所著的印度游记，对于研究印度中古的历史、地理，有着重要的贡献。朝鲜的“李朝实录”和越南的“大南实录”（阮氏此书至今还是写本，未印出），其中所记录的中国十五、六世纪以来（即明、清二代）的中国史实，对于中国的历史学者们是有很大的用处的。波斯人民在唐代的长安成为很受欢迎的客人。五代的一个诗人李珣，就是波斯籍的，他的用中文写的作品至今还保存在“花间集”里。至于日本、朝鲜、越南等国的作家们用中文写的著作那就更多了，可以写成一本很厚的目录。阿拉伯人在唐、宋、元、明各代留居在中国的不少。伊斯兰教在中国文化上发生较大的影响，它最早是由阿拉伯人传来的。在医药上，在天文学上，在数学上，在食品制造术上，阿拉伯人和印度人的影响都同样地巨大。一部元代人编纂的“饮膳正要”，其中饮食制作之方，就有许多是中亚的传统方法。所有这一切都足够说明中国同亚、非的许多国家之间，以及亚、非的许多国家的彼此之间，从古以来就有了很频繁的文化交流，彼此在文化上相互影响着，相互吸取着彼此之所长，而使自己的文化成长起来。这也就是说，在所有的亚、非国家之间，其文化从古以来，就有着千丝万缕的关系，声气相闻，吸呼相通。
    这样的密切的文化关系，到了西方的帝国主义者们起来之后就被人为地割断了。亚非的许多国家丧失了主权，成为殖民地或半殖民地，同时，在残酷的被剥削，受压迫的情况之下，渐渐地不可能有力地发展自己的文化。有少数受奴役的知识分子，甚至丧失了民族自尊心，常常“数典忘祖”，蔑视或忘却自己的伟大的优良的文化传统。这正是帝国主义者所使用的巩固其统治权的方法之一。帝国主义最怕殖民地或半殖民地国家的觉醒，更怕这些国家彼此之间的相互往来、相互影响，甚至连商业上的往来也都被加以切断或隔绝。他们还在各个国家或民族之间，加以挑拨离间，制造不和或纠纷。这就使得亚、非许多国家彼此之间长时期声闻相隔，文化阻塞不通。
    随着两次世界大战的结束，殖民地和半殖民地的人民都相继地觉醒起来，更有力地、更勇猛地为自己国家的自由和独立，向帝国主义者进行斗争。这样，就在亚非地区有了新的气象，涌现了许多新的独立国家。在这些国家中，一类是由共产主义的政党领导的，如中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国。另一类是由民族主义者领导的，如印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和亚、非其他许多国家。所有这两类国家虽是新的国家，其中大部却都是古老的国家。值得骄傲的优秀的民族文化遗产，开始恢复其固有的万丈光芒。同时，这些国家也就表现出要求恢复亚非国家彼此之间被人为地中断了的文化交流事业。
    最近这几年来，部分亚非国家在这方面已经做了不少工作。从文化代表团、艺术代表团的彼此往来，到展览会和各种体育活动的展开，标志着这些国家之间的文化交流事业正日益扩大，日益频繁。像这样的文化交流，不仅巩固了彼此之间的友谊，不仅使彼此人民之间更增加了解，而且也大有助于保卫亚非地区和整个世界的和平。现在，亚非会议在其联合公报中，更就进一步扩大亚、非国家之间的友谊，增强彼此之间的文化交流事业，以及保卫亚非地区和世界的和平，表示了极大的决心。
    为了恢复并发展亚非许多国家间的文化交流，是要做很多的工作的。首先，亚非国家之间必须要有充分的关于历史和文化的介绍。但是，目前有的连初步的介绍都还没有做到。举一个例来说。关于中国的面貌，关于中国人民的工作、生活的情况，好些亚非国家就不大了解。它们往往还执着过去帝国主义者侮蔑中国人民的书籍，作为了解中国的帮助。说起中国农民来，就要举出赛珍珠的小说里的人物；说起中国知识分子来，就要谈及林语堂的荒谬的作品。它们不知道，要真正了解中国人民，那些向壁虚造的无聊之作，是只会使人发生误解的。曾有一位印度朋友告诉我，接触了新中国的人民，才明白赛珍珠的小说是如何歪曲了中国人民的形象。由此可见，亚非国家间的关于历史和文化的介绍工作，越快做、越多做，就越有好处。
    其次，古典的和现代的文学和艺术的创作，应该大量地彼此翻译出版；专门的翻译人材要尽快、尽多地培养。这些文艺创作是最具体的了解一个国家和那个国家的人民的东西。我们要了解印度，就必须翻译出印度大史诗“摩诃波拉他”和“拉马耶那”，以及许多用印地文、彭加利文、乌都文和塔米尔文写的近代文学作品来。要了解缅甸、土耳其、埃及等等国家，也是必须多译、快译出它们的著名作品来。
    最后，体育团体的彼此往来，文化艺术团体的彼此往来，各式各样的展览会的常时举行，也都是很有必要的。
    我们相信，在亚非会议之后，亚非国家之间的文化交流事业，一定将会更加巩固和发展的。
