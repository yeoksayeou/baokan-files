    Practice Thrift and Oppose Waste in Capital Construction!
    Editor's Note: Since this newspaper exposed some wasteful phenomena in capital construction, many readers have written to severely criticize the behavior of certain departments in not cherishing state property during construction, and have put forward suggestions for deeply carrying out the opposition to waste. This shows that the broad masses of the people are very concerned about the cause of national construction. Today, we are publishing excerpts of some of the letters, hoping that all construction units, construction teams, and architects will pay attention to these opinions and criticisms, further examine their work, and deeply criticize various erroneous ideas in construction.
    Hopes of Two Soviet-bound Capital Students
    We are international students studying at the Moscow Kuibyshev Institute of Civil Engineering. Recently, after reading the "A Wasteful and Unsuitable School Building" published in the People's Daily on March 30, we felt very angry. We believe that this kind of waste is intolerable. As the motherland has just begun its first five-year plan, it is necessary to pay attention to such waste in the construction of an ordinary school building. This phenomenon must not be allowed to continue.
    Now, let us introduce the situation of the Moscow Kuibyshev Institute of Civil Engineering. This institute is a four-story building, and the whole building is almost full of classrooms and laboratories, without any unnecessary decoration.
    The utilization rate of teaching and research office is very high, and every corner of the laboratory is filled with various instruments and experimental equipment. Although these latest instruments are not placed in magnificent cabinets, their utilization rate is very high.
    Now let's take a look at the auditorium of the institute. The auditorium has wooden wall panels and floors, with ordinary chairs, and Stalin's last words hanging on the wall. There is no other special decoration. This auditorium is multi-purpose, used as an auditorium during meetings and as a large classroom at ordinary times, accommodating about 500 people. In the event of grand festivals such as the October Revolution Day and the "May 1st" International Labor Day, other agency clubs or theaters are borrowed. For this reason, we believe that some public meeting places can be built in the big cities of the motherland, and it is not necessary to build their own auditoriums and clubs separately, so as to avoid waste.
    The offices of a department in our school are only one or two rooms, with the desks of the department head, deputy head, and secretary. The school's sports field is public, and we go to the public sports field for physical education classes every time.
    This is the general situation of the school facilities of the Kuibyshev Institute of Civil Engineering: simple and unadorned, but equipped with various complete laboratories, and every corner of the school is being used. Now, our classes are divided into two shifts, morning and afternoon. The morning shift is from 8:00 am to 2:00 pm, and the afternoon shift is from 2:00 pm to 8:00 pm or 10:00 pm. This not only improves the utilization rate of classrooms, but also makes full use of experimental equipment.
    The People's Daily editorial pointed out: It is necessary to prohibit wasteful phenomena in construction that disregard economic principles, and call on everyone to pay attention to the cost per square meter of housing, and not allow it to exceed the national regulations. This is completely correct. The Soviet Union also emphasizes this very much now. In our studies, teachers first pay attention to whether students have reached the standard of economic accounting in their designs. Like the construction design we have learned, the calculation of workers on the construction site and various cranes must reach the highest utilization rate, so that there is no idle time, and the unit cost of each design cannot exceed the national indicators. In terms of house design, the primary issue is whether the materials are economical and applicable, and whether they meet national standards and specifications. On this issue, the teacher's attitude is absolutely strict. For example, one of our classmates designed a two-story dormitory, and the foundation area used was slightly larger than it should be. The teacher severely criticized him, and pointed out that this wasteful thinking should be overcome in student days.
    We hope that the construction workers of the motherland, with a high sense of responsibility, will build buildings for the people of the motherland that meet practical needs, are both applicable and economical, strong, and beautiful, and meet the requirements of the country. Bi Kebao Xu Jiwei
    The Capital Should Set an Example
    Under the guise of "national form," the architectural trend of revivalism has spread rapidly from Beijing to major and medium-sized cities across the country in the past two or three years. As a result, whether in the busiest streets or in the remote suburbs, one can see "antique" "palaces" and "temples."
    Taking Jinan City as an example, more than a dozen larger office buildings, shops, auditoriums, classrooms, clubs and theaters built last year all adopted glazed tiles, large roofs, flying eaves, brackets, red lacquered round columns, colored paintings, carvings, palace lanterns and strange-shaped doors and windows to varying degrees. Some designers' "originality" has reached an unimaginable level, such as: the gate cover of the People's Theater is the entire lotus seat under the Buddha statue. The rafters under the flying eaves in front of the Shandong Theater are painted with a kind of flower, which is said to symbolize "a hundred flowers blooming." Some decorations are arranged around the roof of the Guangming Theater, and the outer wall is surrounded by a daughter wall. These decorations have to "admire themselves"!
    Do these buildings, which cost a lot of materials and labor, give people a very beautiful feeling? The answer is no. Taking the Shandong Theater as an example, although the budget was repeatedly increased, it still could not catch up with the endless "icing on the cake" of the host and designers, and finally had to cut off a section of the front building. The Guangming Theater is almost everywhere with ornate carvings and sculptures, but its vulgar image, disharmonious color matching, and clumsy expression techniques can only be more ugly.
    This trend has become so rampant that anyone who opposes excessive decoration is accused of being "stingy"; simple buildings are all called "lacking ideology." People who pursue formalism and revivalism often quote the lectures of certain architectural "authorities" and cite the "national form" buildings in Beijing as examples to prove that their squandering of state property seems to be well-founded. This kind of blindness is certainly wrong, but the wrong example set by some buildings in the capital cannot be shirked in any way. Therefore, it is hoped that in the struggle against the waste of construction projects, Beijing's construction projects can first overcome past shortcomings and mistakes, and establish the principle of "applicable, economical, and paying attention to beauty under possible conditions" for the rest of the country to learn from. This is my hope.

    We Oppose Wasteful Phenomena
    I am a staff member of the Jilin Provincial Asbestos Factory. After repeatedly reading the article "Two Luxurious Dormitory Buildings" published in the People's Daily on March 28, I feel that the serious waste phenomenon revealed in the article is simply a criminal act.
    The cost of the six pavilions on the roof alone is more than 546,000 yuan, which is equivalent to 60.6% of the profit turned over by our Asbestos Factory throughout 1954. In our work, the worker comrades feel that the more profit they turn over to the country, the more glorious it is. Therefore, we work day and night to consider the labor effect of every minute and every second, so as to accumulate more funds for the country, so that the country can concentrate on key industrial construction, and strive for the early arrival of a socialist society.
    In our factory, the living area of ​​general staff dormitories is only 7.87 square meters per household, and there are also eight households who work on a 17 square meter stove kang. The staff still work actively in such an environment and strive to overfulfill the national production plan. For example, in February, the asbestos ash workshop of our factory completed 102% of the production plan, reduced costs by 3.41%, and completed labor productivity by 101.98%.
    We believe that the work of our factory is still not up to the requirements of the Party and the government. There are five grass bags in our factory's warehouse that were thrown in the garbage dump and not used. The comrades also believe that this is a waste of state property. Therefore, how can we tolerate the serious waste of the two dormitory buildings in Di'anmen, Beijing? In addition to agreeing that the building design unit and designers must conduct in-depth review as mentioned in the newspaper, we also require the construction units of these two buildings and the design review agencies and approval agencies to conduct in-depth review.
    It should be stated that we are not opposed to Beijing building dormitories for agency cadres. We hope to build Beijing as beautiful as Moscow. But what we oppose is: spending hundreds of thousands of yuan of the country's huge funds - the people's blood and sweat - on unnecessary "architectural forms."
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Lei Zhenming
    Can It Still Be Tolerated?
    After reading the article "Two Luxurious Dormitory Buildings" published in the People's Daily, I felt very angry! At present, the people of the whole country are working hard for the country's socialist construction, trying to increase production and practice thrift, and accumulate funds for industrial construction. However, some responsible persons and designers of construction units, under the control of formalism and revivalism, waste a lot of state funds, disregard the architectural principles of "economy, applicability, and beauty", and pursue "unique" styles unrealistically. This is essentially a reflection of bourgeois ideology in architecture, and this kind of thinking and action has nothing in common with the requirements of socialism.
    Since studying the Party's general line during the transition period, people have been working tirelessly to build socialism as soon as possible. All the staff of the Fourth Normal School of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are meticulous in their calculations, and feel honored to be able to save a pound of coal, an ounce of rice, a piece of paper or a pen for the country; for the same purpose, we all save on food and clothing in our personal lives, and use the surplus money to buy public bonds and savings to support the country's socialist construction. But it is painful that the money that people have worked so hard to save is wasted by them arbitrarily. Can this still be tolerated?
    The money wasted on these two luxurious buildings in Di'anmen, Beijing, can be used to build many more decent schools. Think about it, would our cadres be willing to confine themselves in luxurious "palaces" and watch the lack of school buildings?
    We cannot let this phenomenon continue. I suggest that the Party newspaper further expose and criticize this bad trend in order to clarify the erroneous ideas in construction projects.

### 厉行节约，反对基本建设中的浪费！

专栏：厉行节约，反对基本建设中的浪费！

    厉行节约，反对基本建设中的浪费！
    编者按：自从本报揭发基本建设中的若干浪费现象以后，许多读者纷纷来信，对某些部门在建筑中不爱惜国家财富的行为进行了严肃的批评，并提出了深入进行反对浪费的建议。这表示了广大人民群众对国家建设事业是非常关怀的。今天我们摘录了一部分来信发表出来，希望所有的建筑单位、施工单位和建筑师们重视这些意见和批评，进一步检查自己的工作，深入批判建筑中的各种错误思想。
    两个留苏首都学生的希望
    我们是在莫斯科古比雪夫建筑工程学院学习的留学生。最近，我们读到三月三十日人民日报刊载的“一座浪费的不适用的学校建筑”后，感到很气愤。我们认为，这种浪费现象是不能容忍的，祖国刚开始第一个五年计划，在盖一座普通的校舍时竟如此浪费，是应该引起所有建筑工作者的注意的，决不能再让这种现象继续发生了。
    现在，让我们介绍一下莫斯科市古比雪夫建筑工程学院校舍的情况吧。这个学院是一座四层楼房的建筑物，整座房子几乎都是教室和实验室，没有各种不必要的装饰。
    教研组办公室等利用率均很高，每个实验室的角落里都摆满了各种仪器和实验用具。这些最新式的仪器虽没有放在富丽堂皇的柜橱中，而它的使用率却很大。
    现在再来看看学院的礼堂吧，这个礼堂是木制的墙板、地板，室内安放普通的椅子、墙上悬挂着斯大林的遗言，此外再没有什么特殊的装璜粉饰了。这个礼堂是兼用的，开会时作礼堂，平时作大教室，约可容五百人。如遇到盛大节日如十月革命节，“五一”国际劳动节等集会时，就借用其他机关俱乐部或戏院。为此，我们觉得在祖国的大城市中可以建筑一些公用的集会场所，不必各自单独去建筑自己的礼堂和俱乐部，以免造成浪费。
    我们学校一个系内的办公室只是一间或两间房子，内有系主任、副主任和秘书的办公桌。学院的运动场是公共的，每次上体育课时就到公共体育场上去。
    这就是古比雪夫建筑工程学院校舍设备的一般情况：简单、朴素，却具备有各种完善的实验室，学校的每一角落都被利用着。现在，我们上课是分成上下午两班，上午班是从早八时到下午二时，下午班是从下午二时到晚八时或十时。这样不仅提高了教室的使用率，实验用具也得到充分的利用。
    人民日报的社论曾指出：必须禁止建筑中不顾经济原则的浪费现象，号召大家重视每平方公尺房屋的造价，决不容许超过国家规定的指标。这是完全正确的。苏联现在也很强调这一点。在我们的学习当中，教员首先注意同学们在设计中是否达到经济核算的标准。像我们所学的施工设计，不论是工地上的工人和各种起重机等的计算，都是要达到最高利用率，不使有一个空闲停顿的时间，每个设计的单位造价都不能超过国家指标。在房屋设计方面，首要问题就是材料是否经济适用，是否合乎国家标准规格。在这个问题上，教师的态度是绝对严格的。例如，我们有一个同学设计一座二层楼的宿舍，用的房基面积比应该用的大了一点，教员就严厉地批评了他，并指出这种浪费思想，在学生时代就应该克服。
    我们希望祖国的建筑工作者，应本着高度负责的精神，为祖国人民建造切合实际需要，既适用又经济、坚固，而且美观，合乎国家要求标准的建筑物。毕可宝  许记蔚
    首都应该树立榜样
    在“民族形式”的外衣掩盖下，复古主义的建筑风气，在过去两三年内很快地由北京传播到全国各大、中城市。于是，无论在最热闹的街道以及偏僻的市郊，都可以见到“古色古香”的“宫殿”和
  “庙堂”。
    以济南市为例，去年建筑的十几座较大的办公楼、商店、礼堂、教室、俱乐部和剧院，都在不同程度上采用着琉璃瓦、大屋顶、飞檐、斗拱、红漆大圆柱、彩绘、雕饰、宫灯以及奇形怪状的门窗等等。有些设计师的“独出心裁”竟达到想入非非的地步，如：人民剧场的门罩是把佛像下面的莲花座整个搬下来的。山东剧院前面飞檐下面的椽头上都彩绘着一种花卉，据说是象征“百花齐放”的。光明剧院屋顶周围布置了一些雕饰，外面又用女儿墙围起来，这些雕饰不得不“孤芳自赏”了！
    这些花费了大量材料和劳动力的建筑物，是否给予了人们一个很美的感觉呢？回答是否定的。以山东剧院为例，虽然再三追加预算仍赶不上主持人与设计师们的无休止的“锦上添花”，终于迫不得已将前面的大楼削去一截。光明剧院几乎到处都是花团锦簇的雕饰塑型，但其形象之庸俗、配色之不和谐以及表现手法之拙劣却只能是益彰其丑。
    这股风气已经猖獗到这种地步：谁如果反对过份的装饰就被指责为“寒呛”；朴素一些的建筑物一律被称为“没有思想性”。追逐形式主义和复古主义的人，往往振振有词地引用某些建筑“权威人士”的讲法，和举北京的“民族形式”的建筑物为例，证明他们对国家财产的挥霍，似乎是很有根据的。这种盲目性当然不对，但首都的某些建筑作出了错误的榜样，这无论如何是不能辞其咎的。因此，希望在反对建筑工程浪费现象的斗争中，北京的建筑工程能首先克服过去的缺点和错误，树立起“适用、经济并在可能条件下注意美观”的原则，以供全国各地学习。这就是我的希望。

    我们反对浪费现象
    我是吉林省石绵厂的一个工作人员，我反复地读了三月二十八日人民日报刊载的“两幢豪华的宿舍大楼”一文后，感觉文中所揭露的严重浪费现象，简直是一种犯罪的行为。
    楼顶上六个亭子的造价就达五十四万六千多元，相等于我们石绵工厂一九五四年全年生产上缴利润的百分之六十点六。在工作中，工人同志们感觉到给国家上缴利润越多就越光荣。因此，夜以继日地考虑每一分一秒的劳动效果，以便为国家积累更多的资金，让国家集中用到重点工业建设上，争取社会主义社会早日到来。
    在我们厂里，一般职工宿舍居住面积每户只有七点八七平方公尺，还有八户是在十七平方公尺的灶炕上活动，职工们在这样环境下仍然积极工作，争取超额完成国家生产计划。如二月份，我厂石绵灰车间完成生产计划百分之一百零二，降低成本百分之三点四一，劳动生产率完成百分之一百零一点九八。
    我们认为我厂工作仍赶不上党和政府对我们的要求。我厂仓库有五个草袋子抛在垃圾堆里未被利用，同志们也认为这是不珍惜国家财产的浪费现象。因而，我们怎么能容忍北京地安门两幢宿舍大楼的那种严重的浪费呢？除同意报纸上所说的建筑设计单位和设计者必须深刻检讨外，我们要求这两幢大楼的建筑单位和审核设计机关、批准机关也应作深刻的检讨。
    应当说明：我们并不反对北京修建机关干部宿舍，我们希望把北京建筑得像莫斯科那样美丽。但我们反对的是：把数以几十万元计的国家巨额资金——人民的血汗，去花在不必要的“建筑形式”上。　
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　雷震鸣
    难道还能令人容忍吗
    我读了人民日报刊载“两幢豪华的宿舍大楼”一文后，感到十分气愤！目前全国人民都为国家的社会主义建设而艰苦奋斗，想办法增产节约，积累工业建设资金，而竟有这样一些建筑单位的负责人和设计师，在形式主义和复古主义的思想支配下，大量浪费国家资金，无视“经济、适用、美观”的建筑原则，脱离实际地去追求“独特”样式。这实质上是资产阶级思想在建筑上的反映，这种思想和行动是和社会主义的要求毫无共同之处的。
    自从学习党在过渡时期的总路线以来，人们都为早日建成社会主义而不懈地努力。我们中国人民解放军第四师范学校的全体人员都精打细算，以能为国家节约一斤煤、一两米、一张纸或一支笔而感到光荣；为了同样目的，我们在个人生活上都节衣缩食，将余钱买公债和储蓄，以支持国家社会主义建设。但痛心的是，人们辛辛苦苦节约起来的钱，却被他们任意浪费了。这难道还能令人容忍吗？
    北京地安门这两幢豪华的大楼所浪费的钱是可以建筑很多座比较像样的学校的。想想看吧，难道我们的干部愿意把自己关在豪华的“宫殿”里，而眼看着校舍缺乏的现象吗？
    我们不能让这种现象继续下去了。我建议党报进一步揭发和批判这种不良倾向，以澄清建筑工程中错误的思想。
