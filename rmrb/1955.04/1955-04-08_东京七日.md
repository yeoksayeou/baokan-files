Tokyo, April

(I)

The spring rain fell drizzlingly, incessantly. Tokyo was shrouded in gloom. The black stone walls surrounding the Imperial Palace and the moats outside the walls are Tokyo's oldest buildings, remnants of the castle and outer moat built by the feudal lord of Edo in the 15th century when he first built this city. This area looks even more cold and forbidding. The cherry blossoms, still in bud, along the streets seem to lack the strength to bloom in the rain and chilly spring wind. The painters who linger on the Ginza streets in search of portrait clients to make a living have been frowning these days, sitting at home on empty stomachs... People curse the wind and rain that have robbed them of their spring.

However, Japanese women's representative Kikue Yamakawa said at the welcome meeting for the Chinese trade delegation to Japan: People's thoughts and sincere feelings can block the cold, and make the friendship between the people as warm as the spring sunshine forever.

The Chinese trade delegation to Japan was hosted at the Imperial Hotel near the Imperial Palace. This is a hotel converted from the former Imperial Palace Property Management Office. No matter how the rain falls, no matter how strict the security is here, the number of people who come to request a visit to the Chinese delegation, just those who have registered, always amounts to dozens every day. Managers of business companies bring sample books, and bosses of trading firms carry large briefcases, arriving in an endless stream every day. There are also many people who do not come to talk about business, but just want to pay tribute to the delegation sent by the Chinese people. Many Japanese who were captured in China during World War II and later released and returned to their country came to Tokyo from the Tohoku region, Kyushu, and Hachijo Island, the southernmost part of Japan. A farmer from a village in the Tohoku region brought only five liters of wheat with him when he set off from his hometown, and sold it here for travel expenses and food, because his family had no cash. Some people raised travel expenses with the help of friends. They came to the Imperial Hotel just to say a few words of greetings to their Chinese friends. How difficult it is for these simple words to be directly conveyed to the ears of Chinese friends! But they said: Don't talk about these economic difficulties, nothing can stop them from coming. Usami Seijiro, a famous Japanese economist and professor at Hosei University in Japan, came to visit the Chinese delegation specifically because his works had been translated into Chinese and published in China, and expressed his hope that China and Japan could exchange professors. He said: If he could raise enough travel expenses, he would definitely visit China. Many people waited day after day, coming again and again...

The Rising Sun flag and the Five-Star Red Flag were hung side by side in the venues of the dinner party and welcome meeting held by the Japanese side for the delegation.

When delegation leader Lei Renmin talked about the disasters caused to the people of China and Japan by Japanese militarism, and that the Japanese people should not be held responsible, the smiles of relief on the faces of the Japanese audience were hard to describe. Japanese commentator Kiyotaro Shimizu wrote an article in the Japanese near-conservative magazine "Chuo Koron" after visiting China, which included a record of his conversation with a Chinese farmer. He wrote: In an agricultural production cooperative in the western suburbs of Beijing, Wang Fuhai, the director of the cooperative, introduced rural life to me. As we talked, Wang Fuhai recalled the suffering of his past life. At this time, he mentioned "imperialism" and talked about the atrocities of "Japanese aggressors" who ravaged his village. As I listened to his conversation, I dared not look at the person talking, but lowered my head and looked at my toes. Then, Wang Fuhai said: "But this was done by Japanese imperialism and has nothing to do with the Japanese people. The Japanese people are our brothers." Shimizu Kiyotaro wrote: His words made me feel relieved, and gradually I raised my head again and looked into the intelligent eyes of this Chinese farmer.

Yes, the Japanese people have always opposed Japanese militarism. They will not allow the history of militarism to be repeated. Their assistance to the Japanese Red Cross and other three groups in transporting the remains of Chinese martyrs who died in Japan back to China is also a demonstration against militarism. I visited the "Executive Committee for the Consolation of the Souls of Chinese Captives and Martyrs." This is a small attic room of less than ten square meters. Three or four Japanese people work here all day long. The table is covered with piles of photos - records of the discovery, excavation, transportation, and memorial services for the remains of Chinese martyrs in various places; the walls are covered with maps indicating the locations where these remains were unearthed; and are full of advertisements for memorial services held in various places. Anyone who has been here cannot help but feel that the owner of this house has dedicated his body and mind to the work they are doing. Akatsu Masuzo was wearing rather untidy clothes, his face thin and somewhat haggard. A Japanese Buddhist monk was also here. The third was a Japanese overseas Chinese woman who had returned from China. The number of people who automatically participate in this work throughout Japan is impossible to count. The Chinese in Tokyo once told me about a touching incident with a heavy and excited mood. The remains of Chinese martyrs were found in Kiso Valley, a rural village near Nagano Prefecture in Japan. The monk Handa of Zenkoji Temple decided to go there to collect the remains. Although the distance from Nagano to Kiso Valley is not far, transportation is very difficult. It takes a whole day to go there once by train, mountain climbing train, plus walking. There are no inns to stay in in the remote Kiso Valley. However, this enthusiastic monk overcame various difficulties, arrived at Kiso Valley, and stayed there for several days, collecting the remains of the martyrs.

I have been moved more than once by the scene of Japanese people raising their hands and shouting "Long live the People's Republic of China!" At the welcome dinner hosted by the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly, Tomika Torao, the president of the Hokkaido Trade Association, was so excited when he called out this slogan because he spoke a little excitedly, his face flushed. For a time, the cheers of the whole audience shook the wooden-roofed Tsubakiyama Villa. On the morning of the second day after the arrival of the Chinese trade delegation to Japan, I met the old senior of Japanese women, the famous old poetess Yanagihara Byakuren. She had a head of white hair and deep wrinkles on her face, and looked like she was nearly seventy years old. She warmly walked up to me and greeted me. Others introduced to me that she was the daughter-in-law of Miyazaki Toten, who was famous for sponsoring Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary activities. For many years, she has not been very engaged in social activities. In the past two years, she has changed her reclusive life again and participated in the movement to demand the restoration of diplomatic relations with China. On this day, she appeared again at the Tokyo "Restore Japan-Soviet, Japan-China Diplomatic Relations" conference, where she read out a resolution on behalf of the presidium demanding the expansion of cultural exchanges with the Soviet Union and China. At that time, I was surprised, where did this old woman find new strength? These days, I have found an answer from the speeches of all kinds of Japanese people: The people of China and Japan have a deep friendship, and this friendship has been invigorated by the prosperity of New China. A member of parliament who had been to Beijing asked me to convey his respect to the Chinese people, saying: China is the cultural home of Japan. The help given to the Japanese people by the Chinese Red Cross is something the Japanese people can never forget. He shook my hand tightly and said that the people of China and Japan will join hands for the common future of mankind. (April 5th)

    东京七日
    本报记者　汪溪
    东京通讯
   （一）
    春雨淅淅沥沥地下个不停。东京笼罩在阴郁里。围绕着皇宫的黑色石头砌起的宫墙和墙外的壕沟，是东京最古老的建筑，十五世纪日本封建主江户初建这个城市时所筑的城堡和外壕的遗留物。这一带更显得冷冰冰的。大街两旁含苞初放的樱花，在雨和寒峭的春风里，像是没有怒放的力气了。徘徊在银座街头寻找画像主顾以餬口的画家，这几天深锁眉头，空着肚子坐在家里……。人们咀咒着这夺去了他们的春天的风雨。
    但是，日本妇女代表山川菊荣在欢迎中国访日贸易代表团的大会上说：人们的思想和诚恳的心情会挡住寒冷，使人民之间的友谊，永远像春天的阳光一样地温暖。
    中国访日贸易代表团被招待住在皇宫左近的帝都饭店。这是由原皇宫财产管理事务所改建的旅馆。不论雨怎样下，不管这儿的门禁怎样森严，前来要求拜访中国代表团的，光是已登记的，每天总有几十起。企业公司的经理带着样品本，贸易行的老板们夹着大皮包，每天络绎不绝。也有不少人并不是来谈生意，而只是想向中国人民派来的代表团致敬的。有许多个在第二次大战中在中国被俘、后来被释放回国的日本人，从东北地方、九州和日本最南部的八丈岛，赶到东京来。一位从东北地方某乡村来的农民从家乡动身时，随身只带了五升麦子，到这里变卖作旅费和伙食费，因为他家里没有现钱。有的是经过朋友捐助才筹得路费的。他们到帝都饭店来，只是向中国友人说几句问候的话。这几句简单的话，能直接传达到中国朋友的耳朵里，是多么不容易！但是他们说：不要说这点经济上的困难，无论什么也挡不住他们要来的心情。日本著名的经济学者、日本法政大学教授宇佐美诚次郎，因为他的著作曾被译成中文在中国出版，专诚来拜访了中国代表团，并表示希望中日两国能交换教授。他说：如果他能筹到足够的旅费，他定要到中国去访问。许多人等了一天又一天，来了一次又一次……。（二）
    太阳旗和五星红旗并排地悬挂在日本方面为代表团举行的晚宴会和欢迎大会的会场里。
    当雷任民团长讲到日本军国主义给中日两国人民造成的灾难，不能要日本人民负责的时候，日本听众脸上那种快慰的笑容是很难形容的。日本评论家清水几太郎访问中国后，在日本接近保守的杂志“中央公论”上写过一篇文章，其中有一段记录了他和一位中国农民的谈话。他写道：在北京西郊一个农业生产合作社里，社主任王福海向我介绍农村生活。谈着谈着，王福海回忆起过去生活的苦难来了。这时，他提到了“帝国主义”，说到了“日本侵略者”蹂躏他的村庄的暴行。我听着他的谈话，眼睛不敢再注视着谈话的人，只低头望自己的脚尖。接着，王福海说了：“但是，这是日本帝国主义干的，和日本人民没有关系。日本人民是我们的兄弟。”清水几太郎写道：他的话，使得我如释重负，渐渐地我又把头抬起来，望着这位中国农民聪明的眼睛。
    是的，日本人民从来都是反对日本军国主义的。他们不许军国主义的历史再演。他们把协助日本红十字会等三团体，将在日本殉难的中国烈士遗骨运送回中国，也是对军国主义的示威。我参观了“中国人俘掳殉难者慰灵实行委员会”。这是一间不到十平方公尺的阁楼小屋。有三四个日本人就在这里整天地工作着。桌上摆着大堆的照片——各地发现中国烈士遗骨，挖掘、启运、开追悼会的纪录；墙上贴着注明这些遗骨被发掘出来的地点的地图；挂满了各地举行慰灵祭（追悼会）的广告。到过这里的人，不能不感到这屋子的主人，是把身心献给他们从事的工作了。赤津益造穿着不大整齐的衣服，脸庞清瘦而有些憔悴。一位日本佛教会的和尚也在这里。第三位是从中国回国的日本侨民妇女。在日本全国各地自动参加这件工作的人，就无法统计了。东京的华侨曾经带着又沉痛又兴奋的心情，向我讲述过一件感人的事。在日本长辜县附近的木曾谷乡下发现了中国烈士的遗骨。善光寺的和尚半田决定到那里去收集这批遗骨。从长辜到木曾谷，路虽不远，但是交通很困难。坐火车，乘爬山电车，加上步行，去一次要整整一天才能到。在偏僻的木曾谷又没有客栈可住。但是这位热心的和尚，克服了各种困难，到达了木曾谷，并且在那里逗留了好几天，把烈士遗骨收集起来。
        （三）
    我不只一次地被日本人举起双手、高呼“中华人民共和国万岁！”的场面所激动。由东京都议会主持的欢迎晚宴上，北海道贸易会会长富火虎雄因为话讲得有些激动，他高呼这个口号时，兴奋得脸通红了。一时，全场的欢呼震撼了木椽竹顶的椿山庄。在中国访日贸易代表团到达东京的第二天上午，我遇见了日本妇女的老前辈，旧日著名的古词家柳原白莲。她满头白发，脸上有深陷的皱纹，看上去是近七十岁的老人了。她亲热地走向前来向我打招呼。别人向我介绍说她是曾经赞助孙中山先生革命活动的有名的宫崎滔天的儿媳。多少年间，她已经不大从事社会活动了。这两年，她又改变了深居简出的生活，参加了要求同中国恢复邦交的运动。这一天，她又出现在东京“恢复日苏、日中邦交”的大会上，她代表主席团宣读了要求扩大同苏、中两国的文化交流的决议案。当时，我感到惊讶，这位老人从什么地方找到了新的力量？这几天，我从形形色色的日本人的讲话里找到了一个答案：中日两国人民有深厚的友谊，这种友谊由于新中国的兴盛而增添了活力。一位到过北京的议员嘱我转达他对中国人民的敬意时说：中国是日本的文化老家。中国红十字会给予日本人民的帮助，是日本人民永不能忘的。他紧紧地同我握手说，中日两国人民将为人类共同的未来而携起手来。　（四月五日）
