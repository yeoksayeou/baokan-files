    Planned Expansion of High-Yielding Crops – Corn
    Ma Jueweng
    Corn is a high-yielding dryland crop. According to the experience of farmers in Shanxi Province, planting corn generally increases yields by 50 to 100 jin per mu compared to other coarse grains; in the Wen Deng and Lin Yi regions of Shandong Province, corn yields are 50% to 100% higher per mu than crops like millet and foxtail millet; in the Quzhou and Jinhua regions of Zhejiang Province, autumn corn yields 60 to 100 jin more per mu than buckwheat and other crops. In recent years, farmers in some areas have also achieved record-breaking high yields of corn. For example, the Wang Jiabin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hebei Province achieved a corn yield of 1,782 jin per mu; the Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shanxi Province achieved a corn yield of 1,518 jin per mu. These examples all illustrate the great potential for increased corn production. Therefore, actively promoting the expansion of corn planting is of great significance for rapidly increasing grain production.

    However, expanding corn planting must be carried out in a planned manner, based on different regions and conditions. In the Northeast region, the corn planting area can be increased along with the reclamation of wasteland; in the main winter wheat producing areas of the North, corn can be appropriately intercropped in wheat stubble fields, provided that water conservancy conditions have been improved and fertilizer application has increased; in the South, full use can be made of autumn fallow land to plant more autumn corn. In addition, some areas can appropriately reduce the planting area of some low-yielding millet, foxtail millet, finger millet, buckwheat, or sorghum and millet, and switch to planting corn. Expanding the corn planting area involves a series of issues such as the planting habits, food needs, and fodder requirements of the masses, and is a complex task. Therefore, agricultural departments in various regions must pay attention to solving these problems when leading farmers to increase corn planting.

    Due to different natural conditions and soil properties in various regions, the yield per unit area of corn in individual areas is not necessarily higher than that of other dryland grains. For example, high-yielding crops in the Liaocheng region of Shandong Province include corn, dryland rice, and millet. In western Inner Mongolia and northern Shaanxi, sorghum yields are higher than corn yields. In the western three districts of Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, the average annual yield of corn is only 250 jin per mu, while the average annual yield of sorghum is 280 jin per mu. In these types of areas, it is not advisable to promote the expansion of corn planting. If corn planting is promoted mechanically, it will be counterproductive.

    In order to ensure increased corn production, various regions should pay attention to improving corn cultivation techniques. Especially in areas where corn is newly planted, the dissemination of corn cultivation techniques should be strengthened. Using improved varieties, concentrating fertilizer application, rational close planting, intertillage and soil mounding, timely topdressing and irrigation, artificial assisted pollination, detasseling and seed selection, preventing and controlling underground pests, and using "666" to irrigate the heart to prevent corn borers are all important measures to increase corn production. Agricultural departments in various regions should lead farmers to do these tasks well.

    有计划地多种高产作物——玉米
    马矍翁
    玉米是一种旱地高产作物。根据山西省农民的经验，种植玉米比其他杂粮一般每亩可增产五十到一百斤；山东省文登、临沂等专区的玉米较黍、稷等作物每亩产量高五成到一倍；浙江省衢州、金华两专区的秋玉米比荞麦等每亩多产六十到一百斤。几年来，有些地区的农民还创造了玉米的高额丰产纪录，如河北省王家彬农业生产合作社的玉米每亩产量曾达一千七百八十二斤；山西省郭玉恩农业生产合作社的玉米每亩产量曾高达一千五百十八斤等。这些事例都说明了玉米的增产潜力是很大的。因此，积极提倡多种玉米，对迅速提高粮食产量有重大的意义。
    但是，多种玉米，必须根据不同地区和不同条件，有计划地进行。东北地区可随着开垦荒地来增加玉米播种面积；北方的冬小麦主要产区，在水利条件已有改善、积肥数量增加的条件下，可利用麦茬地适当复种玉米；南方地区则可充分利用秋闲田，多种秋玉米。另外，有些地区还可以适当缩小一部分低产的黍、稷、穇子、荞麦或高粱、谷子等的种植面积，改种玉米。扩大玉米种植面积要涉及到群众的种植习惯、食用需要和饲草等一系列问题，是一件复杂的工作。因此，各地农业部门在领导农民增种玉米时，必须注意解决这些问题。
    由于各地自然条件和土壤性质不同，在个别地区玉米的单位面积产量也并不比别的旱地谷物高，如山东省聊城专区的高产作物包括玉米、旱稻和谷子，内蒙古西部和陕北地区高粱的产量比玉米高，山西省武乡县西部三个区的玉米常年亩产量只二百五十斤，而高粱常年亩产量是二百八十斤。在这类地区就不要提倡多种玉米，如果机械地提倡多种玉米，将会得不偿失。
    为了保证玉米增产，各地应注意改进玉米栽培技术，特别是在新种植玉米的地区，更应该加强玉米栽培技术的传授工作。远用良种、集中施肥、合理密植、中耕培土、适时追肥灌溉、人工辅助授粉、去雄选种、防治地下害虫和用“六六六”灌心防治玉米螟等都是很重要的玉米增产措施，各地农业部门应领导农民做好这些工作。
