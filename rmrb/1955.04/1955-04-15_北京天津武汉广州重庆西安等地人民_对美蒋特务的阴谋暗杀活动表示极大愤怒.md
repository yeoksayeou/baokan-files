People in Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an and other cities expressed boundless indignation at the murder of members of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference and reporters by US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents, condemning the despicable and shameful act of US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and unanimously supporting the solemn statement of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Chengzi Mine of the Beijing Jingxi Mining Bureau was holding a general meeting of all employees when they heard about the incident. The employees were extremely angry at the despicable and shameless conspiracy of the US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents. Worker Liu Zhengyuan said, "We must respond resolutely to the despicable assassination activities of the US-Chiang Kai-shek with practical actions to increase production!" All the young people in the Telegraph Office of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau wrote to the newspaper, denouncing the conspiracy of US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and proposed: "We guarantee to do a good job in production and work, and wholeheartedly support the Asian-African Conference with practical actions, and resolutely fight to the end to safeguard Asian and world peace!" Cheng Yongxiang, a model worker in Beijing, said, "This is definitely not an ordinary plane crash, this is a planned murder by US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents against the members of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference. We must take revenge!" Zhang Zigao, an old professor at Tsinghua University, said, "The despicable act of US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents in murdering members of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference will never prevent the convening of the Asian-African Conference. We must be vigilant and resolutely fight back against the sabotage activities of the US-Chiang Kai-shek." Tian Fugui, director of the Wei Ying Hutong Women's Congress in Xidan District, burst into tears of hatred after reading the newspaper. She said, "No conspiracy of the US-Chiang Kai-shek can scare the peace-loving Chinese people; nor can it prevent our delegation from participating in the Asian-African Conference. This conspiracy and assassination activity by the US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents will only make peace-loving people all over the world more united."
    Responsible persons of the Tianjin Municipal Local Organizations of various democratic parties and various people's organizations successively issued statements, unanimously believing that this incident was a conspiracy of the US and Chiang Kai-shek special agents, and its purpose was to attempt to murder members of the Chinese delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, so as to intensify international tension and disrupt the Asian-African Conference. They fully supported the statement of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The sixty-four workers of the first team of the Jinggong Workshop of the Tianjin Municipal Local State-owned Fifth Machine Factory wrote to the local newspaper saying: "It is precisely because US imperialism is afraid of peace that it used assassination methods with the Chiang Kai-shek special agents to obstruct the convening of the Asian-African Conference. We firmly believe that this can only strengthen the determination of the people of China and the world to fight to the end to safeguard world, Asian and African peace."
    The workers in the pile driving and pile installing work area of the Wuhan Hanshui Highway Bridge construction site were very angry after hearing the news that the plane carrying the staff of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference was destroyed by US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents. The three units in this work area participating in the labor competition unanimously demanded that the responsibility for this incident be investigated and clarified. Peng Yangqin, a representative of the National People's Congress and a special-class industrial labor model in Wuhan, said indignantly: This plane crash is obviously a political conspiracy by US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Their despicable behavior cannot stop our determination to participate in the Asian-African Conference and defend world peace. The migrant workers and cadres fighting on the Wuhan embankment also unanimously stated that they would build the embankment well and defeat the sabotage conspiracy of the US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents like they did last year when they overcame the flood.
    Responsible persons of various people's organizations in Guangzhou issued statements one after another to protest this crime. The staff of the Guangzhou Railway Administration held a forum, unanimously expressing their full support for the statement of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and demanding that the British government and the Hong Kong authorities quickly find out the truth of this murder incident and arrest and bring the murderers and relevant criminals to justice. Yi Meihou, director of the Returned Overseas Chinese Friendship Association, said: This incident is a crazy manifestation of the US and the Chiang Kai-shek gang's hostility towards the Chinese and Asian-African people and their deliberate attempt to sabotage Asian-African and world peace. This blood debt must be repaid, and we, the returned overseas Chinese and their relatives, are determined to fight to the end against the destruction of the US aggression group and Chiang bandits. Many workers, staff of state organs, teachers and students also said that they will be more vigilant in the future, guard against enemy sabotage, and actively produce, work and study to accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland.
    The vast number of employees in Chongqing gathered and wrote letters to protest this atrocity. Li Jichang, the leader of the electric furnace production team in the steelmaking workshop of Factory 102, said: The British authorities in Hong Kong bear serious responsibility for this incident. We unanimously support the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and demand that they quickly arrest and bring to justice the murderers involved in the murder. Yang Ru Kun, representative of the National People's Congress and special-class labor model in Chongqing, said: The sabotage conspiracy of the US-Chiang Kai-shek can never stop the holding of the Asian-African Conference. We must support the struggle of our delegation to defend peace with actions to comprehensively fulfill the national plan.
    People from all walks of life in Xi'an resolutely demanded that the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong thoroughly investigate the truth of this incident and quickly arrest and bring to justice the murderers and relevant criminals. The staff of the New Northwest Printing Factory held a forum on this incident. Everyone unanimously believed that the despicable behavior of the US and Chiang Kai-shek special agents could not stop the Chinese people from participating in the Asian-African Conference; and unanimously stated that they would support the statement of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs with practical actions to fulfill the production plan for April. Geng Zhixue, director of the Houcun Huangyan Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Xi'an City, and Feng Shoujing, director of the Vegetable Production Cooperative, both stated that they would support the struggle of the Asian-African people for peace with practical actions to increase production and improve cooperative affairs. The troops under the Shaanxi Military Region all expressed their firm support for the statement of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
