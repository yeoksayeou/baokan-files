    Develop China's Hydropower Construction Undertaking
    Tu Guolin
    The flow of rivers contains tremendous power. If this power can be used to generate electricity, it can not only save a large amount of fuel, but also, because of its low cost and majestic power, it is of great significance for the development of industrial and agricultural production. In addition, hydropower construction can simultaneously undertake the two major tasks of controlling rivers and utilizing rivers, that is, combining hydropower generation with flood control, irrigation, navigation improvement, industrial water supply, and the development of fisheries and natural transformation, so that all interests can be comprehensively resolved to the greatest extent possible. Therefore, hydropower generation plays a significant role in promoting socialist industrialization and the long-term economic development of the country.
    China is a country with very rich hydropower resources. According to a very rough estimate, the total hydropower resources in China are about 150 million kilowatts, which is equivalent to one kilowatt of hydropower resources for every four people in the country.
    The Yangtze River is the river with the most abundant hydropower resources in China. If hydropower stations are built on the Three Gorges, the Jinsha River in the upper reaches, and the Mabian River in the tributaries of the Yangtze River, a large amount of electricity can be generated. The Yangtze River also has many tributaries with large water volumes and long sources, such as the Dadu River, Minjiang River, Jialing River, Wujiang River, Han River, Zishui River, Yuanshui River, Ganjiang River, etc., all of which have huge amounts of hydropower resources. China's second largest river, the Yellow River, the Lancang River, Nujiang River, and Yarlung Zangbo River in the southwest, the Songhua River, Heilongjiang River, Ussuri River, Yalu River, and Tumen River in the northeast, the Pearl River in the south, and the mountainous areas in the eastern provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, etc., as well as Taiwan and other places, also have abundant hydropower resources. In particular, the southwestern provinces have abundant hydropower resources, accounting for about 65 percent of the country's total hydropower resources.
    China not only has abundant hydropower resources, but also, due to the natural conditions of China's rivers, the amount of earth and stone excavation and concrete pouring required for hydropower station projects is relatively small. In addition, the middle and upper reaches of China's rivers often run through mountains and canyons, with rapid water flow and narrow widths, and the loss of reservoir inundation is small, so the construction time can be shortened.
    Although China's hydropower resources are very abundant and have natural advantages for building hydropower stations, hydropower construction was out of the question in the era of reactionary rule. When Japanese imperialism occupied Northeast China, in order to plunder the resources of Northeast China in large quantities, they started construction in 1937 and built the Xiaofengman Hydropower Station at the cost of the lives of Chinese workers. Later, the Kuomintang reactionaries poured 20,000 cubic meters of concrete on the dam, but the Kuomintang reactionaries destroyed the power plant of the Xiaofengman Hydropower Station when they collapsed.
    After liberation, with the development of China's economic construction, investment in hydropower station construction has increased year by year. The planned investment in 1955 alone increased by more than 60 percent compared with 1954. Hydrological survey work for the development of water resources is also expanding year by year. The overall development plan for the entire Yellow River basin and economic surveys and geological and hydrological surveys on some other important rivers are underway. After the completion of the huge reconstruction project of the Xiaofengman Hydropower Station, it will get rid of its past backward and incomplete state and become China's first large-scale hydropower station. There are several hydropower stations under construction, including the largest Lion Beach Hydropower Station on the Longxi River in Sichuan, Southwest China, which has a power generation capacity more than twice that of the Chongqing 507 thermal power plant, and the Guanting Hydropower Station, which will soon supply power to the capital. The Shilongba Hydropower Station in Yunnan and the Ulabai Hydropower Station in Xinjiang have been completed. These hydropower stations can not only greatly promote China's industrial construction after completion, but also, during the construction process, are practical schools for China's hydropower construction. They will train a large number of cadres and technical personnel for China's future large-scale hydropower construction.
    In the past few years, we have accumulated some experience in building hydropower stations. We already have experience in large-scale concrete dam construction, deep-water cofferdam projects, long tunnel excavation, concrete pump tunnel lining, and excavation of huge underground powerhouses, large-scale earth and stone foundation excavation, installation of small, medium, and large-sized water turbines and steel pipelines, and power plant construction. In addition, the degree of mechanization of construction is also increasing year by year. Various construction sites widely use mixing machines to produce and supply concrete. Steel rails and small internal combustion engine locomotives are widely used for transportation inside construction sites. Various types and lifting cranes, winches, and concrete buckets are widely used for pouring concrete dams and lifting heavy objects. Hundreds of types of excavators, pneumatic picks, pneumatic drills, electric rock loading machines, bulldozers, mechanical lifting equipment for vertical well slag removal, automobiles, electric welding machines, power equipment, and other various machine tools for repairing and matching machines are used for excavating earth and stone. Construction Site 101 has successfully used alloy drill bits to drill blast holes and grouting holes, greatly increasing the drilling rate. In the past, for rocks with a coefficient of 8 or 9 degrees, three or four high-carbon steel drill bits were required for every meter of drilling. With alloy drill bits, continuous drilling of 20 or 30 meters is possible, and the blade can be used three or four times after being dulled. Therefore, an alloy drill bit is almost equivalent to the efficiency of more than 300 high-carbon steel drill bits, and it also saves the time of changing drill bits and downtime. We have made a very rough calculation that if all the stone excavation on China's hydropower station construction sites in 1954 had used alloy drill bits, about 1.7 million yuan could have been saved. Perhaps the actual figure is not that high, but it is certain that using alloy drill bits to excavate stone can save money and improve efficiency. At Construction Site 102, the comprehensive mechanization of the entire labor process of mining, screening, washing, and transporting sand and gravel aggregates has achieved preliminary success. For example, with two stone screening machines and two stone washing machines, plus belt conveyors, bulldozers, and other necessary equipment, the production capacity in one day and night is 800 cubic meters of sand and gravel, which is equivalent to the manual production volume of about 2,000 workers per day in the past. Hydropower station construction requires a large amount of concrete, and every 10,000 cubic meters of concrete requires more than 10,000 cubic meters of sand and gravel aggregates, so the demand for sand and gravel aggregates at hydropower station construction sites is very huge. Mechanizing the processes of sand and gravel mining, crushing, screening, and transportation is of great importance. One construction site had to temporarily hire 4,000 to 5,000 workers to manually break stones because the stone crushing machine arrived two months late, which cost the state more than 300,000 yuan in wages.
    At present, there are still many shortcomings and problems in hydropower construction. In addition to the fact that the design cannot keep up with the construction, the utilization rate of machinery is still very low, and the damage rate of machinery is also very high due to insufficient maintenance capacity. The mechanical utilization rate of the Guanting Reservoir construction site is only about 28 percent. At Construction Site 102, the utilization rate of only four types of machinery, such as crawler cranes and nine-ton cranes, is only over 9 percent. Due to frequent changes in plans and designs, blind procurement, and the lack of a sound balance and dispatching system between construction sites, the accumulation of materials and equipment at construction sites is also very serious. In addition, many advanced experiences have not been well summarized and promoted, and a large potential force has not been fully utilized. For example, in 1954, all construction sites generally completed the tasks stipulated by the state, but they always failed to complete the tasks in the first three quarters, while the fourth quarter not only completed the tasks of this quarter, but also completed the tasks that were not completed in the first three quarters. The task completion volume was also the largest in December of the fourth quarter. Taking Construction Site 101 as an example, the task completed in December accounted for 23 percent of the year, while the last 11 days accounted for about 120 percent of the first 20 days. These shortcomings need to be overcome vigorously in the future.
    Hydropower resources are a fairly important component of China's entire treasure. Although our current strength in building hydropower stations is still very weak and there are still many shortcomings and problems, with the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to learn from, and with the assistance of Soviet experts and Soviet technology, we are full of confidence in the construction of hydropower stations.

    发展我国的水电建设事业
    涂国林
    江河的水流蕴藏了巨大的力量，如果能利用这种水流力量来发电，不仅可以节省大量的燃料，而且由于成本便宜，力量雄伟，对于工业和农业生产的发展，有极大的意义。另外，水力发电建设可以把控制河流和利用河流两大任务同时担负起来，即把水力发电和控制洪水、引水灌溉、改善航道、工业给水，以及发展渔业和改造自然等任务结合起来，使各项利益都得到最大可能的综合解决。因此，水力发电对于社会主义工业化和国家长远的经济发展，具有重大的推进作用。
    我国是一个水力资源非常丰富的国家，根据很粗略的估计，我国水力资源的蕴藏量约为一万万五千万瓩，等于全国每四个人就拥有一瓩的水力资源。
    长江是我国水力资源蕴藏量最丰富的河流。如果在长江的三峡、上游金沙江、支流马边河上建立水电站，可发出很大的电力。长江还有很多水量大、源流长的支流，如大渡河、岷江、嘉陵江、乌江、汉水、资水、沅水、赣江等，也都拥有巨量的水力资源。我国的第二条大河——黄河，西南的澜沧江、怒江、雅鲁藏布江，东北的松花江、黑龙江、乌苏里江、鸭绿江、图们江，南部的珠江和东部的福建、浙江等省多山地区，以及台湾等地的水力资源也都很丰富。特别是西南各省，水力资源蕴藏量丰富，约占全国水力资源的百分之六十五。
    我国不仅水力资源丰富，而且由于我国河流的天然条件，水电站工程所需开挖的土石方量和浇筑的混凝土量都较少，加上我国河流的中上游多穿行于丛山峡谷中，水流急而幅度狭窄，水库淹没损失较小，因此可以缩短建设的时间。
    虽然我国水力资源蕴藏量非常丰富，并且有着建设水电站的天然优越条件，但在反动统治的年代里，根本谈不上水电建设。日本帝国主义侵占我东北时，为了大量掠夺东北的资源，曾于一九三七年动工，并以中国工人的生命为代价，修建了小丰满水电站，后来国民党反动派又在大坝上打了二万立方公尺混凝土，但国民党反动派在溃退时，却破坏了小丰满水电站的发电厂。
    解放后，随着我国经济建设事业的发展，水电站建设的投资也一年比一年增加，仅一九五五年的计划投资就比一九五四年增加百分之六十以上。为了开发水力资源而进行的水力勘测工作也是年年都在扩大。黄河的全流域开发规划工作和其他一些重要河流上的经济调查和地质水文勘测工作都正在进行。小丰满水电站的巨大改建工程完成后，它将摆脱过去那种落后的、残缺不全的状态，成为我国第一座大型的水电站。正在建设的水电站有好几处，其中有发电能力大于重庆五○七火力发电厂一倍的西南地区最大的四川龙溪河狮子滩水电站，有不久就要向首都供电的官厅水电站。已经建成的有云南的石龙坝水电站、新疆的乌拉拜水电站。这些水电站不仅在建成后，可以大大促进我国工业建设，而且在建设过程中，也是我国水力建设的实践学校，它们将为我国未来大规模水力建设培养出大批的干部和技术人材。
    几年来，我们已经积累了一些建设水电站的经验。我们已经拥有进行大规模浇筑混凝土堤坝、进行深水围堰工程、开挖长隧洞、使用混凝土泵进行隧洞的混凝土护面衬砌的经验，以及巨大地下厂房的开挖、大量土石方基础开挖、由中小型到巨型水轮机和钢管道的安装、电厂建筑等经验。另外，施工的机械化程度也在逐年提高。各工地广泛地使用拌和机生产和供应混凝土。各工地内部的运输广泛地采用钢轨道和小型内燃机车头。在浇筑混凝土堤坝和起卸沉重物件时，广泛使用了各式和各种举重的起重机、卷扬机、混凝土吊桶。开挖土石方所使用的挖土机、风镐、风钻、电力装岩机、推土机、直井出渣的机械提升设备、汽车、电焊机、动力设备，以及其他各种为修配机械用的工作母机等数百种。一○一工地已经成功地使用合金钻头钻炮孔和灌浆孔，大大地提高了钻进率。过去，对系数八九度的岩石，每钻进一公尺就需要三、四个高炭钢钻头，使用合金钻头，则可以连续钻进二、三十公尺，刀口用钝磨后还可以再用三、四次。因此，一个合金钻头几乎等于三百多个高炭钢钻头的使用效率，而且还省去了换钻头歇工的时间，我们做了一个很粗略的计算，如果一九五四年所有我国水电站建筑工地的石方开挖全部使用合金钻头，约可节省一百七十万元。也许实际上不到这个数字，但使用合金钻头开挖石方可以节省资金，提高效率是肯定了的。在一○二工地，使砂石配料的采挖、筛选、洗净、装运全部劳动过程综合机械化已经获得初步成就。如用两部筛石机和两部洗石机，加上皮带运输机、推土机和其他必要的设备，一昼夜的生产能力是八百立方公尺的砂石，约相当于以前两千工人一天的手工生产量。建设水电站需要大量的混凝土，每一万方混凝土就需要一万多方砂石配料，因此在水电站建设工地砂石配料的需要量是非常巨大的。使砂石的采挖、破碎、筛选、装运过程机械化有非常大的重要性。有一个工地因为碎石机运到时间迟了两个月，不得不临时雇用四五千工人用手工打碎石块，使国家在工资开支上多花了约三十多万元。
    目前，在水电建设方面的缺点和问题还很多，除了设计赶不上施工外，机械的利用率还很低，而由于检修力量不足，机械的损坏率也很大。官厅水库工地的机械利用率只及百分之二十八。一○二工地只根据履带起重机、九吨重起重机等四种机械利用率计算只达百分之九强。由于计划和设计多变，盲目采购和工地之间缺乏健全的平衡调度制度等原因，而造成工地器材积压的情况也是很严重的。另外，还有很多先进经验没有很好总结和推广，还有很大潜在力量没有充分发挥。如一九五四年各工地一般都完成了国家所规定的任务，可是前三季度总是不能完成任务，而第四季度不但完成了本季度任务，还完成了前三季度未完成的任务。就是第四季度也是以十二月份完成任务量为最大。以一○一工地为例，十二月份所完成的任务为全年的百分之二十三，而最后的十一天又为前二十天完成的百分之一百二十左右。这些缺点都有待于今后大力克服。
    水力资源是我国全部宝藏的一个相当重要的组成部分，虽然我们目前建设水电站的力量还很薄弱，缺点和问题也还很多，但有苏联的先进经验可以学习，在苏联专家和苏联技术的援助下，我们对水电站的建设是充满信心的。
