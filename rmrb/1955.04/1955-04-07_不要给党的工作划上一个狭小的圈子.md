Don't Confine Party Work to a Narrow Circle
Yi Huai

What is Party work? This question seems simple, but many Party workers do not answer it correctly.

Recently, Du Yucen, the Secretary of the CPC Anshan Iron and Steel Metal Structure Engineering Company Committee, wrote a letter stating that in February, the Party Committee, based on the feedback from Party members and the Technical Inspection Section, investigated and dealt with the problem of false reporting of project progress by the No. 5 Installation Team. Some foremen, deputy foremen, and economic planners in this team had serious bourgeois individualistic ideas. In order to gain honor and earn more bonuses, they falsely reported the progress of ten projects in the 1954 handover acceptance list, accounting for 35 percent of the delivered projects. The team leader had a serious bureaucratic style and did not strictly check the project situation, signing and stamping the acceptance list. He did not investigate even after he found out. Most strangely, the team's branch not only did not struggle against this bad behavior of falsely reporting achievements beforehand, but also did not actively participate in the investigation when the Party Committee's inspection team began its investigation. He mistakenly believed that this was an administrative matter and had nothing to do with the Party organization.

It should be said that this branch secretary does not understand what Party work is. Can it be said that such a problem is unrelated to Party work and is purely administrative work? Obviously, in this matter, the team's economic activities have completely deviated from the Party's principles; the team's foremen, deputy foremen, and other cadres have been eroded by bourgeois ideology, and the leading cadres have been stained with bureaucratic dust, and most of them are Communist Party members. If the Party organization does not care about these tasks, what work should the Party organization care about? It is worth noting that this phenomenon is very common in Party organizations in industrial and mining enterprises. Recently, some provincial and municipal local Party committees have inspected and exposed many erroneous facts of state-owned and local state-owned enterprises that violate the country's economic policies. For example, some enterprises, in order to pursue profits, do not hesitate to cut corners, use substandard goods to pose as good goods, and arbitrarily raise product prices; some enterprises, in order to "overfulfill tasks" and get more bonuses, regardless of national requirements, massively produce products that the country does not need but have a large output value and are easy to produce, or pursue output regardless of quality... etc. And the Party organizations in these enterprises often, like the branch of the No. 5 Installation Team mentioned earlier, believe that this is "administrative work" or "technical problem," not within the scope of the Party Committee's work, and therefore peacefully coexist with these capitalist management ideas.

We cannot separate "Party work" and the various economic, cultural… undertakings led by the Party with a wall. If so, Party work will lose its practical significance. Party workers should have sharp eyes. The Party organization should pay attention to all political, economic, and cultural activities in the unit or region where the Party organization is located, and should supervise them to advance under the guidance of the Party's guidelines and policies. If Party work is narrowly understood only as developing Party members, carrying out propaganda and mobilization, etc., then what is the purpose of developing Party members and propaganda and mobilization? Kalinin once gave a good explanation of Party work: "What is the difference between Party work and the work of other departments? If we think that the difference lies in the fact that the Party only specializes in agitation, propaganda, and narrowly defined communist education, I think this understanding is too narrow. Party work lies in—if I may say so—infusing the Party's views and practices into every kind of work, even the most technical and mechanical work." Our Party workers should correct their views on Party work from here.

    不要给党的工作划上一个狭小的圈子

    什么叫做党的工作呢？这个问题看起来很简单，但是很多党的工作人员却回答得不大正确。
    最近，中共鞍钢金属结构工程公司委员会书记杜玉臣来信讲，二月间，党委会根据党员和技术检查科的反映，检查处理了安装五队虚报工程进度的问题。这个队的有些工长、副工长和经济计划员存在着严重的资产阶级个人主义思想，为了骗取荣誉多得奖金，在一九五四年的交工验收单中，虚报了十项工程进度，占交工项目的百分之三十五。这个队的队长官僚主义作风很严重，没有严格检查工程情况，就在验收单上签字盖章，事后知道了也没有检查。最为奇怪的是，这个队的支部事先既没有和这种假报成绩的恶劣行为进行斗争，当党委检查组开始进行检查时，支部书记刘吉新又不积极地参加检查。他错误地认为这是行政的事，和党组织无关。
    应该说，这位支部书记是不懂得什么叫做党的工作的。能够说像这样的问题和党的工作无关而是单纯的行政工作吗？很明显的，在这件事情上，这个队的经济活动已经完全离开了党的原则；这个队的工长、副工长等干部已经受到资产阶级思想的侵蚀，领导干部蒙上了官僚主义灰尘，而其中大多又是共产党员。如果党组织不过问这些工作，党组织究竟应该关心什么工作呢？值得引起注意的是，这种现象在工矿企业的党组织中是非常普遍的。最近以来，有些省市地方党委检查揭露了许多国营和地方国营企业的违反国家经济政策的错误事实。比如，有些企业为了追逐利润，不惜偷工减料，以次货充好货，随便抬高产品价格；有些企业为了“超额完成任务”多得奖金，不顾国家要求，大量生产那些国家不需要但是产值很大容易生产的产品，或者是不顾质量追求产量……等。而这些企业中的党组织就常常像前面谈到的那个安装五队的支部一样，认为这是“行政工作”或者“技术问题”，不在党委的工作范围之内，因而泰然地同这些资本主义经营思想和平共居。
    不能这样把“党的工作”和党所领导的各种经济、文化……事业之间用一堵墙截然分开。如果这样，党的工作就失掉了实际意义。党的工作人员应该目光四射，凡是党组织所在单位或地区的一切政治、经济、文化活动，党组织都应该过问，都应该监督它们在党的方针政策指导下前进。如果把党的工作仅只狭隘地理解为发展党员、搞宣传鼓动等等，那么，发展党员、宣传鼓动的目的又是什么呢？加里宁曾经给党的工作作了一个很好的解说：“党的工作与其他各部门工作有什么区别呢？如果认为区别是在于党只专门进行鼓动、宣传和狭义的共产主义教育，这样了解，我觉得太窄隘了。党的工作就在于——如果可以这样说的话——把党的见解和党的作法灌输到每种工作，那怕是最带技术性和机械性的工作中去。”我们的党的工作人员应该从这里来端正对党的工作的看法。
