    Henan's Industrial and Construction Exhibition is currently being held in Zhengzhou. From February 15th to March 30th, more than 61,000 people from Luoyang, Xinxiang, and other places have visited.

    Stepping into the exhibition, the thriving scene of Henan's industry is displayed before people's eyes. The total industrial output value of the province in 1954 increased by 7.6 times compared to 1950, labor productivity increased by 2.5 times, and costs decreased by 17.03%; the proportion of industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value increased from 4.52% to 14.57%, of which the proportion of modern industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value also increased from the original 2.93% to 12.23%. In 1954, the province's investment in the coal, electricity, textile, and food industries increased by more than 6.8 times compared to 1952.

    In industrial production and construction, the creative labor of the broad masses of workers in Henan left a deep impression on people. Yan Tian'en, a planer at the state-owned Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory, created the "movable workbench" and "rapid flat feed row" in promoting the Soviet "miracle planer knife" and "multi-knife row," saving the entire workshop's planers 49,989 hours a year, equivalent to the working time of one planer for 24 years and 4 months. Wang Jinsheng and his tunneling team at Jiaozuo Coal Mine promoted the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and fraternal mines, creating a national record of 2,110 days of the highest safe production. Engineer Ruan Mengwu successfully trial-produced reinforced concrete tunnel supports and will promote them in state-owned coal mines nationwide. Jiang Guitian, a worker from the Provincial Construction Engineering Company, created an assembly line method for roofing, increasing work efficiency by 3.6 times. In addition, in 1954 alone, the province's oil extraction industry increased oil production by 451 tons, the cigarette industry saved 600,870 jin of tobacco leaves, the wine industry saved 12.84 million jin of grain for making wine koji, and the textile, flour, coal, and electricity industries all increased production and saved a large amount of wealth for the country.

    河南举行工业和建设展览会
    河南省工业和基本建设技术革新展览会正在郑州市举行。从二月十五日到三月三十日，由洛阳、新乡等地前往参观的已有六万一千多人。
    走进展览会，河南工业欣欣向荣的景象显现在人们的面前。全省一九五四年的工业生产总值，比一九五零年增加了七点六倍，劳动生产率增加了二点五倍，成本降低了百分之十七点零三；工业产值占工农业总产值的比例，由百分之四点五二，增加到百分之十四点五七，其中现代化工业产值占工农业总产值的比例，也由原来的百分之二点九三，增至百分之十二点二三。全省一九五四年投于煤、电、纺织、食品诸行业的建设资金，比一九五二年增加了六点八倍多。
    在工业生产和建设中，河南广大职工创造性的劳动给人们留下深刻的印象。国营郑州纺织机械厂刨工阎天恩，在推广苏联“奇妙刨刀”和“多刀排”中，创造了“活动工作台”、“快速平面进刀排”，使全车间刨工一年可节省四万九千九百八十九小时，等于一个刨工二十四年零四个月的工作时间；焦作煤矿王金生及其掘进小组，推广了苏联和兄弟矿的先进经验，创造了二千一百一十天的全国最高安全生产纪录；阮孟武工程师试制成功了钢筋混凝土坑道支架，并将在全国国营煤矿中推广。省建筑工程公司工人江贵田创造了架屋流水作业法，提高工效三点六倍。此外，一九五四年一年内，全省榨油业增产油四百五十一吨，卷烟业节约烟叶六十万零八千七百多斤，酿酒业节约了制酒曲的粮食一千二百八十四万斤，纺织业、面粉业、煤业、电业都为国家增产节约了大量的财富。  （本报驻郑州记者）
