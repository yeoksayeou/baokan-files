Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 4th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" commented on the upcoming Asian-African Conference on the 4th, saying that the Asian-African Conference will be a new step in the movement for national liberation in Asia and Africa and the movement to consolidate peace in these two continents and other regions of the world. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam warmly supports the convening of this conference.

The commentary said: Chairman Ho Chi Minh reiterated the position of the Vietnamese people in safeguarding peace during the visit of Burmese Prime Minister U Nu to Hanoi. Chairman Ho Chi Minh said that regarding international issues, the people and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully support the Five Principles proposed by the governments of the People's Republic of China, India, and Burma. We believe that these principles are the most effective way to maintain peace in Asia and the world.

The commentary said that the Vietnamese people have waged a long and heroic struggle for independence, unification, democracy, and peace, and have achieved great victories. There is no doubt that at the upcoming Asian-African Conference, the representatives of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will work with the representatives of other countries to guide the conference to success.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 5th: The latest issue of "International Life" magazine published a commentary welcoming the upcoming Asian Countries Conference.

The commentary said: The people of Asia have long suffered from the brutal suppression and exploitation of Western colonialists. Now, the face of Asia has undergone fundamental changes. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have become the foundation of new relations between Asian countries.

The commentary pointed out that the US imperialists and their followers, disregarding the opposition of the Asian people, infringe upon the sovereignty of Asian countries, interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries, organize aggressive military blocs, undermine the armistice agreements in Korea and Indochina, intensify tensions in Asia, and conspire to launch new wars. These acts of aggression are a serious threat to peace in Asia.

The commentary pointed out that the Asian people of today are no longer the Asian people of the 19th century. The common will and aspirations of the people of Asian countries must be taken into account.

The commentary expressed confidence that the convening of the Asian Countries Conference will help solve Asian problems and lay the foundation for further consultation and cooperation among Asian countries.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 5th: The Indian "Free Press" published an editorial on the 4th welcoming the upcoming Asian Countries Conference and the Asian-African Conference. The editorial said that the purpose of the Asian-African Conference is to seek ways to make the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence the basis of the foreign policy of all Asian and African countries. If every Asian and African country abides by these principles, then the foundation of imperialism will suffer a serious challenge and threat.

The editorial said that the Asian Countries Conference and the Asian-African Conference will show the new trend in the lives of the people of Asia and Africa. These two continents are home to two-thirds of the world's population, who have suffered plunder and oppression for many centuries.

The editorial said that the fact that these two conferences can be organized despite the opposition of imperialism fully proves that the end of imperialism is approaching.

The "Bombay Chronicle" published an editorial on the 4th commenting on the Asian-African Conference, saying that the whole of Asia is looking forward to the Asian-African Conference to be held in Bandung, believing that it has far-reaching relations and importance for the people of the two continents. The editorial then criticized the Western attitude towards the Asian-African Conference. The editorial said that if Asia wants to criticize the West, there is no reason to complain.

Xinhua News Agency, April 5th: Auckland News: The New Zealand weekly "People's Voice" commented in its March 30th issue on the upcoming Asian-African Conference, saying that this conference is an action against imperialism launching wars and imperialist interference in internal affairs.

The commentary said that it is of great significance that the conference will discuss the urgent problems of countries from Liberia to Japan, which together account for nearly two-thirds of the world's population. The commentary said that the United States has launched a large-scale campaign to oppose the convening of this conference, but the US campaign has failed, and neither threats nor inducements can stop the convening of this conference. The commentary quoted Roberts's article in the "Washington Post" as saying, "Politically speaking, the United States is still very isolated in Asia."

    越南、朝鲜、印度等国报纸发表评论
    欢迎召开亚洲国家会议和亚非会议
    新华社河内四日电　越南“人民报”四日评论即将召开的亚非会议说，亚非会议将是亚洲和非洲争取民族解放的运动以及巩固这两大洲和世界其他地区的和平的运动的一个新步骤。越南民主共和国政府热烈响应这个会议的召开。
    评论说：胡志明主席在缅甸总理吴努访问河内期间再一次申明了越南人民维护和平的立场。胡志明主席说，关于国际问题，越南民主共和国人民和政府充分支持中华人民共和国政府、印度政府和缅甸政府提出的五大原则。我们认为，这些原则是维持亚洲和世界和平最有效的方法。
    评论说，越南人民为争取独立、统一、民主与和平进行了长期的英勇的斗争，并且已经取得了伟大的胜利。毫无疑问，在即将召开的亚非会议上，越南民主共和国代表将同其他国家的代表们一起引导会议获致成功。
    新华社平壤五日电　最近一期的“国际生活”杂志发表评论，欢迎即将召开的亚洲国家会议。
    评论说：亚洲人民曾经长期遭受西方殖民者的残酷镇压和剥削。现在，亚洲的面貌已经发生了根本的变化。和平共处的五项原则已成为亚洲国家间新关系的基础。
    评论指出，美帝国主义者以及它的追随者不顾亚洲人民的反对，侵犯亚洲国家的主权、干涉亚洲各国内政、组织侵略性的军事集团、破坏朝鲜和印度支那的停战协定、加剧亚洲紧张局势并且阴谋发动新的战争。这些侵略行为是对亚洲和平的严重威胁。
    评论指出，但是，今天的亚洲人民已经不是十九世纪的亚洲人民了。亚洲国家人民的共同意志和愿望必须得到重视。
    评论表示确信，亚洲国家会议的召开，将有助于亚洲问题的解决，并将为亚洲国家间进一步的协商和合作打下基础。
    新华社新德里五日电　印度“自由报”四日发表社论，欢迎即将召开的亚洲国家会议和亚非会议。社论说，亚非会议的目的是要寻求途径，使和平共处的五项原则能够成为所有亚洲和非洲国家外交政策的基础。如果每一个亚洲和非洲国家都遵守这些原则，那么，帝国主义存在的基础就将遭受严重的挑战和威胁。
    社论说，亚洲国家会议和亚非会议将显示亚洲和非洲人民生活中的新趋向。这两大洲上居住着全世界的三分之二的人口，他们许多世纪以来遭受着掠夺和压迫。
    社论说，这两个会议能够不顾帝国主义的反对而组织起来，这个事实就充分证明帝国主义的末日已经临近了。
    “孟买纪事报”四日发表社论评论亚非会议说，整个亚洲都在展望着将在万隆举行的亚非会议，认为它对于两大洲的人民有深远的关系和重要性。社论接着抨击了西方对亚非会议的态度。社论说，如果亚洲要对西方提出批评的话，那是没有什么理由可以抱怨的。
    新华社五日讯　奥克兰消息：新西兰周报“人民之声报”三月三十日的一期评论即将召开的亚非会议说，这次会议是反对帝国主义发动战争和帝国主义干涉内政的一个行动。
    评论说，会议将讨论从利比里亚到日本、总共占世界人口将近三分之二的国家的迫切的问题，这是有非常重大的意义的。评论说，美国曾发动了一个大规模的运动来反对这个会议的召开，但是，美国的这个运动失败了，不论是威胁还是利诱都不能阻止这个会议的召开。评论援引罗伯茨在“华盛顿邮报”上所写的文章中的话说，“在政治上说来，美国在亚洲仍然是非常孤立的。”
