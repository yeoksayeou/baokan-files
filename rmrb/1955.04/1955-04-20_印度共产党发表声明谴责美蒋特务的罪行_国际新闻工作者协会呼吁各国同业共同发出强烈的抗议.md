Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 19th - The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India issued a statement on the 18th, condemning the crimes of US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents in murdering members of the Chinese and Democratic Republic of Vietnam delegations and Chinese and foreign journalists attending the Asian-African Conference, and expressing condolences to the families of the victims.

The statement said: This heinous conspiracy can only show the cruel deeds that US imperialism will commit in order to undermine the growing unity among Asian countries.

The statement said: "The reports of the three survivors among the crew members of the 'Kashmir Princess' have fully confirmed the accusation of the Government of the People's Republic of China, that deliberate sabotage was the cause of this incident. The three crew members unanimously said that the explosion was not caused by any defects in any part of the aircraft. All engines were effective until the plane 'plunged' into the sea."

The statement added: "Everyone is very clear that this sabotage must have been committed by the Kuomintang and American secret agents in this nest of spies (Hong Kong). It is very serious that the British authorities in Hong Kong received clear warnings from the Chinese government about the conspiracy beforehand, but did not take effective steps to prevent the sabotage from happening."

The statement said, "The Political Bureau is convinced that the anger aroused by this murder throughout Asia will make the people of Asian countries more determined to unite to defeat imperialism and ensure peace, freedom and democracy in Asia and the world."

Xinhua News Agency, 18th - Robsang Chultum, Counselor of the Embassy of the Mongolian People's Republic in China, visited the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 18th to express condolences for the deaths of members of the Chinese delegation and journalists attending the Asian-African Conference.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 18th - The Secretariat of the International Organization of Journalists issued a statement on the 18th regarding the "Kashmir Princess" plane crash caused by the sabotage of US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The International Organization of Journalists recently received a statement from the All-China Journalists Association regarding the unfortunate incident of the Indian plane crash. In this statement, Chinese journalists strongly protested against the sabotage activities of US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, who murdered Chinese and foreign journalists and members of the delegation of the People's Republic of China and members of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam who were on the plane to attend the Bandung Conference. The International Organization of Journalists echoes the protest of the All-China Journalists Association. The International Organization of Journalists shares the grief of its Chinese colleagues and calls on all professional journalists and journalistic groups to join their Chinese colleagues in issuing a strong protest against the methods and activities used by the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents.

    印度共产党发表声明谴责美蒋特务的罪行
    国际新闻工作者协会呼吁各国同业共同发出强烈的抗议
    新华社新德里十九日电　印度共产党中央委员会政治局在十八日发表声明，谴责美蒋特务谋杀出席亚非会议的中国及越南民主共和国代表团人员和中外记者的罪行，并对遇难人员的家属表示慰问。
    声明说：这一穷凶极恶的阴谋只能表明，美帝国主义为了破坏亚洲各国间的日益增长的团结，会干出怎样残忍的勾当。
    声明说：“‘克什米尔公主号’乘务人员中的三个生还者的报告，已经充分证实中华人民共和国政府的指责，即蓄意破坏是造成这一事件的原因。这三名乘务人员一致说，爆炸不是由于飞机任何部分的任何缺点造成的。在飞机‘冲入’海中以前，所有引擎一直都是有效的。”
    声明又说：“人人都十分清楚，这种破坏一定是（香港）这个间谍巢穴中的国民党和美国特务干的。香港的英国当局事先早就接到中国政府关于阴谋的明确警告，却没有采取有效步骤来预防破坏的发生，这是非常严重的事。”
    声明说，“政治局坚信：这一谋杀行为在全亚洲激起的愤怒，将使亚洲各国人民更加坚决地团结一致，以击败帝国主义，确保亚洲和世界的和平、自由和民主。”
    新华社十八日讯　蒙古人民共和国驻我国大使馆参赞罗布桑楚勒图姆在十八日访问我国外交部，对出席亚非会议的中国代表团人员和记者的遇难表示悼唁。
    新华社布拉格十八日电　国际新闻工作者协会书记处十八日就美蒋特务破坏“克什米尔公主号”飞机致使飞机失事一事发表声明。声明全文如下：
    国际新闻工作者协会最近收到中国新闻工作者联谊会关于印度飞机失事的不幸事件的声明。在这个声明中，中国新闻工作者强烈抗议美蒋特务的破坏行动，他们谋杀了乘飞机前往出席万隆会议的中外记者和中华人民共和国代表团人员以及越南民主共和国代表团人员。国际新闻工作者协会同中国新闻工作者联谊会同声抗议。国际新闻工作者协会分担着中国同业们的悲痛，并且呼吁所有职业新闻记者和新闻团体同他们的中国同业们一道，对美蒋特务所使用的方法和活动共同发出强烈的抗议。
