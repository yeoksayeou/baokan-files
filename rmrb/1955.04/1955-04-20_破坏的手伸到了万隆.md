　　The Asian-African Conference has already opened in Bandung. The U.S. aggressive bloc, which is extremely afraid of the solidarity and cooperation between the peoples of Asia and Africa, is using various channels and methods to sabotage the conference.

　　We have long said that the sabotage of the Indian aircraft by U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek's agents, the assassination of staff members of the Chinese delegation and Chinese and foreign journalists, is only part of the U.S. conspiracy to undermine the Asian-African Conference. As world opinion has already pointed out, one of the purposes of this assassination incident was to provoke relations between China and India.

　　Now, this kind of sabotage conspiracy is being carried out on a large scale in Bandung. The reports on the conference issued by a large number of American journalists, known as the largest "U.S. delegation" at the Asian-African Conference, show that they went there for this conspiracy. They even couldn't wait for the conference to open, and they tried their best to exaggerate the differences between the countries participating in the conference, create "news of discord" between China and India, and predict that the conference would not achieve anything. They tried their best to slander the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, saying that whoever agrees to these five principles is admitting China's so-called "dominant role" in Asia. From the consistency of their propaganda tone, it can be clearly seen that a special envoy sent by the U.S. State Department, appearing in Bandung under the name of "reporter," played a great role in creating and organizing this chorus.

　　The U.S.'s activities to undermine the conference are having an impact in the "Independence" Building—the venue of the Asian-African Conference—in Bandung. G.K. Reddy, a reporter for the "Indian Times," pointed out that some members of the delegation are conducting open activities against the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He said, "Some of them arrived with 'memoranda' containing the same content," "which were meticulously written 'arguments' on various controversial political issues that might be raised at the conference." In another dispatch, Reddy also said: "Many invited delegations have been listening to the intensified activities of prejudiced elements who want to divide the discussions at the conference."

　　In fact, the U.S. is not only relying on the largest "U.S. delegation" and "those prejudiced elements" to carry out sabotage in Bandung, but also directly issuing orders to the Asian-African Conference from Washington.

　　In a statement issued after a meeting with Eisenhower on the 17th, Dulles even asked the Asian-African Conference to try to "condemn" the so-called "practice of realizing national ambitions by force." To translate Dulles' words according to his meaning, it is to ask the Asian-African Conference to "condemn" the Chinese people for liberating Taiwan. Dulles knows very well that he has no power to plan the actions of the Asian-African Conference. His purpose in doing so is to plunge the Asian-African Conference into disputes to poison the atmosphere of the conference and make the conference achieve nothing. While the U.S. is trying its best to provoke and create disputes at the Asian-African Conference, on the other hand, it pretends to be a friend of the Asian-African people and uses so-called economic "aid" to lure Asian-African countries. Just before the opening of the Asian-African Conference, news spread from Washington that the U.S. would establish an agency to coordinate foreign aid affairs, and not only the U.S. and European countries, but also Asian countries would participate in this agency. The U.S. side also claimed that the U.S. would allocate huge sums of money as "Asian regional development funds." The U.S. aggressive bloc is trying to make the countries participating in the Asian-African Conference believe that their only hope for economic prosperity is "U.S. aid" and U.S. capital, not themselves.

　　But the U.S. aggressive bloc cannot wear this grand disguise forever. In some cases, it couldn't help but admit the essence of this "aid." The U.S. National Foreign Trade Council passed a "final declaration" in November 1954. According to the U.S. "Commercial Daily," this declaration believes that: "Any new foreign aid should be limited to 'purely military or strategic needs.' In the case of backward countries, aid should be mainly based on military and strategic considerations." The U.S. monopoly capital group obviously wants to use dollar bullets to achieve its aggressive goals.

　　From the above facts, the U.S. aggressive bloc has stretched its hand of destruction to Bandung from two aspects. On the one hand, it attempts to create division and confrontation, and on the other hand, it attempts to use dollars to lure some countries to serve the U.S. aggressive policy. This is a consistent means adopted by the United States in many regions of the world.

　　The purpose of initiating the Asian-African Conference is not to find disputes and confrontations, but to discuss the common problems of Asian and African countries and promote friendly cooperation between each other. Some of the countries participating in the Asian-African Conference have suffered from colonial rule, and some have not completely gotten rid of colonial control. The disasters of war continue to infringe and threaten them. They have common interests in maintaining and striving for peace and independence and freedom. It should be believed that they have decided to participate in this conference with such a good intention, so that the conference can achieve something, rather than to create disputes and confrontations according to the intention of the United States, so that the conference will be undermined. Indonesian President Sukarno was right in his opening speech at the Asian-African Conference. He said, "Asia and Africa can only prosper after they are united, and without a united Asia and Africa, even the security of the whole world cannot be guaranteed." Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai said in his speech at the Bandung airport: "I believe that our conference will be able to overcome various destructions and obstacles, and make valuable contributions to promoting friendship and cooperation between Asian and African countries, and to maintaining peace in Asia and Africa and the world." For Asian and African countries, the greatest interest today is unity and cooperation, and striving for Asian peace. This is the common aspiration of the Asian and African people and the purpose of the Asian-African Conference. Every country attending the Asian-African Conference has a responsibility to work towards achieving this goal.

    破坏的手伸到了万隆
    胡今
    亚非会议已经在万隆开幕。极端害怕亚非两洲人民团结合作的美国侵略集团正在经过各种途径用各种方法对会议进行破坏。
    我们早就说过，美国和蒋介石的特务分子破坏印度飞机，谋杀中国代表团工作人员和中外记者，只是美国破坏亚非会议的阴谋的一部分。正如世界舆论所已经指出的，这个谋杀事件的目的之一是要挑拨中国和印度之间的关系。
    现在，这种破坏阴谋正在万隆大规模地进行。被称为亚非会议中最庞大的“美国代表团”的大批美国记者所发出的关于会议的报道，表明他们就是为了这个阴谋而去的。他们甚至等不到会议开幕就竭力渲染参加会议的各国之间的分歧，制造什么中印之间“不和的消息”，并且预言会议不会有什么成就。他们竭力诽谤和平共处的五项原则，说谁要是同意这五项原则，就是承认了中国在亚洲的所谓“支配作用”。从他们的宣传论调的一致性中可以很清楚地看出，美国国务院所派遣的以“记者”名义出现于万隆的一位特使，在制造和组织这种合唱中是起了很大作用的。
    美国的破坏会议的活动正在万隆的“独立”大厦——亚非会议会场中起着影响。“印度时报”记者格·克·雷迪指出，某些代表团的人员正在进行公开的活动，反对和平共处的五项原则。他说：“他们中有些人到达时都带着内容相同的‘备忘录’”，“其中是写得很周密的关于可能在会议上提出的各种引起争论的政治问题的‘论据’”。在另一篇电讯中雷迪还说：“许多应邀参加的代表团一直在听凭那些怀有成见的分子向它们加紧活动，这些分子想使会议的讨论发生分歧。”
    事实上，美国不仅是倚靠着会议中最庞大的
  “美国代表团”和“那些怀有成见的分子”在万隆进行破坏，而且还从华盛顿直接对亚非会议发号施令。
    杜勒斯在十七日和艾森豪威尔会谈以后发表的声明中，竟然要求亚非会议设法“谴责”所谓“以武力实现国家野心的做法”。把杜勒斯的话按照他的意思翻译出来，那就是要求亚非会议“谴责”中国人民解放台湾。杜勒斯明知道它没有任何权力来规划亚非会议的行动。他这样做的目的就是要使亚非会议陷于纷争来毒化会议的空气，使会议无所成就。美国一方面竭力对亚非会议进行挑拨离间，制造纷争，另一方面却装作是亚非人民的朋友，用所谓经济“援助”来对亚非国家进行利诱。就在亚非会议开幕前夕，从华盛顿散布出消息说，美国将要成立一个机构来统筹对外援助事务，参加这个机构的不但将有美国和欧洲国家，而且还有亚洲国家。美国方面还宣传说，美国将要拨出巨额款项作为“亚洲区域发展经费”。美国侵略集团企图使参加亚非会议的国家相信，它们经济繁荣的唯一指望是“美援”和美国资本而不是它们自己。
    但是美国侵略集团不可能永远披着这种冠冕堂皇的伪装。在某些场合下，它情不自禁地承认过这种
  “援助”的实质。美国全国对外贸易协会在一九五四年十一月曾通过了一个“最后宣言”。据美国“商务日报”报道，这个宣言认为：“任何新的对外援助应该限于‘纯粹是军事或战略的需要’，就落后国家的情形来说，援助应主要是根据军事和战略上的考虑”。美国垄断资本集团显然想用美元的金弹来达到它的侵略目的。
    从上面的事实看，美国侵略集团从两个方面把破坏的手伸到了万隆。它一方面企图制造分裂和对立，另一方面企图用美元来诱骗一些国家，使它们为美国的侵略政策服务。这是美国在世界上许多地区一贯推行的手段。
    发起亚非会议的目的不是为了寻找纷争和对立，而是为了讨论亚非各国共同的问题，促进相互间的友好合作。参加亚非会议的国家有的是曾经遭受过殖民统治的，有的还没有完全摆脱殖民控制。战争的灾难不断地侵害和威胁着它们。它们在维护和争取和平和独立自由的道路上有着共同的利益。人们应该认为，它们决定参加这个会议也是抱有这样一个善意的目的，使会议有所成就，而不是为了按照美国的意图来制造纠纷和对立，使会议遭到破坏的。印度尼西亚总统苏加诺在亚非会议的开幕词中说得很对。他说，“亚洲和非洲只有在团结起来以后才能得到繁荣，若没有一个团结的亚洲和非洲，甚至全世界的安全也不能得到保证。”我国周恩来总理在万隆机场发表的谈话表示：“我相信，我们的会议一定能够克服各种破坏和阻挠，并对于促进亚非国家之间的友好和合作，对于维护亚非地区和世界的和平作出有价值的贡献。”对于亚非国家来说，今天最大的利益就是团结合作，为亚洲和平而努力。这是亚非人民的一致愿望，也是亚非会议的目的。出席亚非会议的每一个国家有责任为实现这个目的而努力。
