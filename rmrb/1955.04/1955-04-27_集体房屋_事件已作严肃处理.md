Following the publication of an article in the People's Daily on January 28, 1955, regarding the incident in which Liao Jingming, Secretary of the Fifth District Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in Echeng County, Hubei Province, displayed a penchant for grand achievements, failed to proceed from reality, and subjectively and arbitrarily constructed "collective housing" for disaster victims, resulting in losses, the CPC Huanggang Prefectural Committee and the Echeng County Committee have taken the matter seriously and decided to use this incident to educate all Party members and cadres in the region.

The CPC Huanggang Prefectural Committee, Echeng County Committee, and the Fifth District Committee of Echeng County have submitted inspection reports and self-criticism reports to the higher-level Party committee. The main responsible persons directly related to this incident, including Zhang Jinkun, Secretary of the Echeng County Committee of the CPC, Peng Ying, Deputy Secretary, Li Wenming, member of the County Committee and County Head, and Liao Jingming, Secretary of the Fifth District Committee of Echeng County, have all submitted written self-criticisms. In the inspection reports, self-criticism reports of the Prefectural Committee, County Committee, and District Committee, and their individual self-criticisms, they all unanimously expressed their determination to learn from the lessons of this incident and strive to improve their work.

The inspection report of the Echeng County Committee mentioned that the occurrence of this "collective housing incident" was primarily due to the petty-bourgeois agricultural socialist thinking of Liao Jingming, Secretary of the Fifth District Committee, and some members of the District Committee, who mistakenly regarded building "collective housing" as laying the "foundation" for socialism. Liao Jingming one-sidedly emphasized that so-called "collective construction" could "save materials" and "save labor," and was "beneficial" for disaster relief, "good for holding meetings," and "good for building cooperatives," believing that it was collective education for the masses. He lacked a clear understanding of the characteristics of the small-peasant economy and methods for improving it, lacked sufficient understanding of the real needs of the masses after the disaster, and distorted the true meaning of socialism. He mistook the enthusiasm of a few activists for the enthusiasm of the masses and mistook the action of the masses actively demanding to be organized to produce and overcome famine after the disaster as a universal strengthening of collective concepts and a universal weakening of private ownership concepts. Therefore, he subjectively and one-sidedly formulated the so-called "collective housing" plan. As early as the end of August last year, the Fifth District printed a "Rebuilding Homeland Plan," including projects such as clubs, nurseries, libraries, and gardens, and roads for automobiles. Comrade Lian Xisheng, Minister of the Organization Department of the Huanggang Prefectural Committee, criticized this plan at the time, telling them not to do it, but Comrade Liao Jingming did not completely resolve the problem in his thinking and continued to plan for collective construction. It was not until the "collective housing" in Luzhou Township was built and discovered by Wen Ying, member of the Prefectural Committee, and Zhang Jinkun, Secretary of the County Committee, who attended a meeting in the district, that the planning for collective construction in other townships was stopped.

However, the inspection report of the Echeng County Committee pointed out that the occurrence of this incident also reflected the bureaucratic style of leadership of the County Committee. The County Committee did not pay attention to this long-brewing incident, and after the incident occurred, it did not have a sufficient understanding of the adverse consequences caused by this erroneous incident, nor of the harmfulness of this subjective and one-sided agricultural socialist thinking. Therefore, the handling of this incident was not thorough, and criticism of this erroneous incident was not carried out among the broad masses. Education to widely instruct cadres to learn from the serious lessons of this incident was not conducted in a timely manner. Although a circular was issued to the entire county, ordering the district to immediately stop the "collective housing" construction plan and instructing the work team in the township to quickly handle the remaining issues during construction and do a good job in the aftermath, the results of the handling were not thoroughly inspected, and the follow-up work has not been done well enough to this day.

After investigating the causes of the incident, the Echeng County Committee has taken action to deal with the matter. The Prefectural Committee, County Committee, and District Committee have all taken necessary measures to properly handle the aftermath of the "collective housing" incident. The County Committee sent a special person to cooperate with the Luzhou Township Party Branch of the Fifth District to investigate and compensate the masses for the losses they suffered during the construction of the "collective housing," and helped them move back to their original residences and repair their houses. The local masses have eliminated their misunderstandings about socialism and their dissatisfaction with the grass-roots working cadres, and have expressed their gratitude to the Party and the government for their concern.

The CPC Huanggang Prefectural Committee has also assigned the study of this incident to the entire region, instructing cadres in each county and district to examine their own work during the study, further clarify the guiding ideology of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and improve their leadership style and work style. The study for county and district cadres in Echeng County has officially begun. The County Committee has specifically studied the issue of strengthening collective leadership and specific measures to improve the Party committee system. Many district and township cadres have also discussed the harm of handling affairs based on subjective wishes and examined their own subjective ideological styles.

Editor's note: In the "Collective Housing" newsletter and the "Cannot Handle Affairs Based on Subjective Wishes" editorial published in the People's Daily, it was mentioned that the Echeng County Committee of the CPC and Comrade Zhang Jinkun, Secretary of the County Committee, were aware of the plan to build "collective housing" in the Fifth District of Echeng County, but did not promptly stop the implementation of this erroneous plan. We later learned that the "collective housing" plan was initially only understood by individual members of the Echeng County Committee, and Comrade Zhang Jinkun, Secretary of the County Committee, was unaware of it due to continuous attendance at meetings of the Prefectural Committee and Provincial Committee and work in the countryside. After Comrade Zhang Jinkun discovered the error in the Fifth District, he immediately stopped the erroneous behavior of the Fifth District. Therefore, our previous criticism of Comrade Zhang Jinkun was inappropriate.

### “集体房屋”事件已作严肃处理

    “集体房屋”事件已作严肃处理
    一九五五年一月二十八日，人民日报发表了中共湖北省鄂城县第五区区委书记廖镜明好大喜功，不从实际出发，主观武断地为灾民修建“集体房屋”因而造成损失的事件以后，中共黄冈地委和鄂城县委已作了严肃的处理，并决定用这个事件来教育全区的党员、干部。
    中共黄冈地委、鄂城县委和鄂城县第五区区委已向上级党委作了检查报告和检讨报告。和这一事件有直接关系的主要负责人：中共鄂城县县委书记张金锟、副书记彭英，县委委员兼县长李文明，鄂城县第五区区委书记廖镜明等，已作了书面检讨。地委、县委和区委的检查报告、检讨报告和他们个人的检讨中，都一致表示要记取这一事件的教训，努力改善和提高工作。
    在鄂城县委的检查报告中提到：这个“集体房屋事件”的发生，首先在于五区区委书记廖镜明和部分区委有小资产阶级的农业社会主义思想，错误地把盖“集体房屋”当成是为社会主义打“基础”。廖镜明片面地强调所谓“集体盖屋”可以“省材料”、“省人工”，对救灾有“好处”、“好开会”、“好建社”，并且认为这是对群众的集体主义教育。他对小农经济的特点和改进小农经济的方法认识不清，对受灾后群众的真实要求认识不够，对真正的社会主义作了歪曲的理解，把少数积极分子的热情当成是群众的热情，把受灾后的群众积极要求组织起来生产度荒的行动，当成是集体观念的普遍加强和私有观念的普遍削弱，因而，就主观片面地拟定了所谓“集体房屋”计划。早在去年八月底，五区就印制了“重建家园计划表”，其中包括俱乐部、托儿所、图书室、花园、汽车路等项目。黄冈地委组织部长廉希圣同志当时就批评了这个计划，要他们不要那样做，但廖镜明同志在思想上并没有完全解决问题，仍然继续进行集体盖屋的筹划。直至芦洲乡“集体房屋”盖成，被地委委员温英、县委书记张金锟到该区参加会议发觉，制止后，才停止了其他乡集体盖屋的筹划。
    但是，鄂城县委的检查报告中指出，这一事件的发生，也反映了县委领导上的官僚主义，县委对这一长期酝酿的事件没有引起注意，事件发生后，又对这一错误事件所造成的恶果认识不足，对这种主观片面的农业社会主义的思想的危害性认识不足。因此，对这一事件的处理不彻底，没有在广大群众中开展对这一错误事件的批判。没有及时对干部广泛地进行吸取这一事件的严重教训的教育。虽然对全县发出了通报，责令该区迅速停止修建“集体房屋”的计划，责成该乡工作组迅速处理建造中的遗留问题，做好善后工作，但对处理的结果，未深入检查，善后工作至今仍做的不够。
    鄂城县委在检查出事件发生的原因以后，对这个事件已经作了处理。地委、县委和区委都已经采取了必要的措施，妥善地处理了“集体房屋”事件的善后工作。县委派出了专人协同第五区芦洲乡党支部调查后，赔偿了群众在修建“集体房屋”时遭受的损失，并帮助他们迁回了原来的住址，修复了房屋。当地群众已消除了对社会主义的误解和对基层工作干部的不满情绪，纷纷表示感谢党和政府对他们的关怀。
    中共黄冈地委还向全区布置了对这一事件的学习，指示各县、区干部在学习中检查自己的工作，进一步明确互助合作运动的指导思想，改进领导作风和工作作风。鄂城县县、区干部的学习已经正式开始。县委会专门研究了加强集体领导的问题，和健全党的委员会制度的具体办法。很多区、乡干部也讨论了凭主观愿望办事的危害性，检查了自己的主观主义的思想作风。
      编者按：在人民日报发表的“集体房屋”的通讯和“不能凭主观愿望办事”社论中都曾提到，鄂城县五区修建“集体房屋”的计划，中共鄂城县委和县委书记张金锟同志都是知道的，但都没有及时制止这个错误计划的执行。以后我们了解到，这个“集体房屋”计划，最初只有鄂城县委的个别委员了解，县委书记张金锟同志因连续去地委和省委开会和下乡工作，并不知道。张金锟同志发觉五区的错误以后，就立即制止了五区的错误行为。因此，我们以前对张金锟同志的批评是不恰当的。
