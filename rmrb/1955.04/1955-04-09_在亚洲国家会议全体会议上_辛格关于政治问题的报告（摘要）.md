At the Asian Countries Conference Plenary Session
Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 8th.
Dr. Anup Singh, Indian Member of Parliament and former Chief Representative of India to the United Nations Commission on Korea, presented a report on political issues at the plenary session on the 7th on behalf of the Indian delegation to the Asian Countries Conference.

Singh said that the new awakening of Asia is an event of far-reaching historical significance. Today, the awakened Asia is once again filled with revitalized energy. We have decided that from now on, we will determine our own destiny, and we will never allow anyone to decide our destiny behind our backs. This new awakening of Asia to a common destiny stems from our shared circumstances and the recent common struggle for freedom.

Singh said that the Five Principles announced by the Prime Ministers of India and China have placed the new Asia at the forefront of world affairs, and Asia has risen to a new position.

Since Prime Minister Nehru and Premier Zhou Enlai issued a joint statement, countries around the world have learned that times have changed. The two largest countries in Asia have united, not for collective aggression, but for collective peace.

Since then, Asian countries have successively expressed their approval of these Five Principles, and Asian unity has become a reality today.

When talking about the prohibition and supervision of weapons of mass destruction, Singh said that what frightens mankind the most today are weapons of mass destruction. Is it this sinister messenger of death and destruction that brings us to destruction, or do we use atomic energy for constructive purposes? This is the challenge of our time. He said that the international atmosphere is constantly being poisoned by "massive retaliation" and threats to use nuclear weapons against the people of various countries. Prominent scientists, public leaders, and religious leaders around the world have unanimously protested against atomic bomb tests and the mad race in manufacturing weapons of mass destruction.

Singh said, we suggest: First, the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction must be banned immediately. Second, current stockpiles should be destroyed. Third, before signing an international agreement banning the manufacture of nuclear weapons, an agreement should be reached stipulating that all further experiments must be stopped.

When talking about colonialism and foreign interference in the internal affairs of Asian countries, Singh said that after a long struggle, most of the Asian people have finally gained their freedom. However, there are still areas in Asia and elsewhere where people have not gained freedom and are suffering from oppression and exploitation. We believe that the use of blatant violence in the current era is a crime against the conscience of human civilization. He mentioned the issue of Indochina, saying that the agreement on Indochina reached in Geneva last year was a victory for peaceful consultation and ended a terrible chapter in the history of Indochina. We demand that foreign interference in Indochinese affairs must end. We condemn violations of the armistice agreement, and we demand that the armistice agreement must be faithfully and conscientiously observed.

Singh said that West Irian is another dangerous spot that continues to intensify international tensions. Negotiations between the Netherlands and Indonesia should be resumed immediately in order to return West Irian to Indonesia. We fully support the Indonesian people's claim that West Irian is an inseparable part of Indonesia.

Singh then talked about the Taiwan issue. He said that historically, Taiwan has always been a part of China. After the Sino-Japanese War in 1894, the island was ceded to Japan according to the Treaty of Shimonoseki. During the Second World War, the three major powers announced at the Cairo Conference in December 1943 that all territories that Japan had seized from China, such as Manchuria, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands, would be returned to the Republic of China. He said that President Truman announced on January 5, 1950: "The United States has no intention of acquiring special rights or privileges or establishing military bases in Taiwan, and the United States government does not intend to follow any path that would involve the United States in China's internal conflicts." Completely disregarding this solemn guarantee, some people are now fabricating the absurd theory of "two Chinas" to cover up their true purpose. General MacArthur, with his characteristic rudeness, revealed this purpose without reservation. He said: "From this island chain, we can use the air force to control every Asian seaport from Vladivostok to Singapore and prevent any hostile actions from entering the Pacific." Now, the discarded Chiang Kai-shek regime has been supported, and Taiwan has been used as a military base by the United States. He said that China's reaction to this policy is inevitable. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, said: "I now declare on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China that Truman's statement on June 27 and the actions of the U.S. Navy are armed aggression against China's territory and a complete violation of the United Nations Charter." He also said: The Chinese people will unite as one and strive to liberate Taiwan.

India's attitude towards the issue of Taiwan and the coastal islands of China has been expressed very clearly by the President and Prime Minister of India. Whether from a historical, geographical, or legal point of view, Taiwan belongs to China, and the stationing of foreign troops on Taiwan is a blatant violation of Chinese sovereignty. We demand that all U.S. troops withdraw from Taiwan and the coastal islands and return these islands to China immediately.

Singh said that Goa is an inseparable part of India. The Indian government has made consistent efforts to negotiate with Portugal, but Portugal has treated this peaceful proposal with indifference, silence, and often a contemptuous refusal and a crude threat of force. He said that we believe that the Portuguese government should be required to stop its reign of terror, release all political prisoners, and give the residents of Goa normal civil liberties. The Portuguese government should be urged to negotiate with India on the peaceful transfer of Goa. He said that the people of Malaya do not have freedom, and Malaya is a place of mass arrests, shootings, and the burning of the homes of thousands of people. In addition, the situation of the people in Kenya, Morocco, Tunisia, and other parts of Africa is also very tragic. We express our deepest sympathy for their heroic struggle for freedom.

Singh said, we demand the complete end of the vicious colonial system all over the world, and the people who are ruled by others anywhere must enjoy their freedom; we demand that all foreign troops should withdraw from Asia and stop all foreign interference in the internal affairs of Asian countries.

When talking about military treaties and foreign bases, Singh said that Asian countries believe that military treaties and bases are a new and insidious infringement on their independence. The Indian government and people have unequivocally condemned the "Southeast Asia Defense Organization." We believe that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is a military bloc, which divides the Asian people and is part of the "Asians fighting Asians" policy. We believe that this is a sinister conspiracy to continue and re-establish foreign rule over certain parts of Asia under a new guise. He said that this conference should show its absolute and complete opposition to all military treaties and demand that all foreign troops be withdrawn from Asian lands and all foreign bases be abolished.

Singh talked about the position of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, saying that the emergence of the People's Republic of China is a great historical event. This republic has established and consolidated its power throughout mainland China. This People's Republic has been recognized by several countries. However, some countries continue to refuse recognition for completely fabricated and untenable reasons. He said that China is one of the founding members of the United Nations and has a permanent seat on the Security Council. The question is: Who can have the legitimate right to claim to represent China in the United Nations? Is it the representative of Chiang Kai-shek, or the representative of the People's Republic? It is an insult to common sense to continue to maintain the fabricated statement that the so-called representative of Chiang Kai-shek represents China.

He said that deliberately ignoring the new government of China is an extremely serious political error, because without the active and full cooperation of China, no major issue related to Asia can be resolved; without China's participation, no major issue facing the United Nations can be resolved. He said, we suggest that all Asian countries recognize the People's Republic of China, its representative should obtain a seat on the Security Council, and Chiang Kai-shek's representative should be expelled.

When talking about the normalization of diplomatic relations between Asian countries, Singh said that we suggest that all Asian countries should establish direct formal relations with each other, and relations that were severed during the war should be restored and normalized.

Singh said when talking about the peaceful reunification of Korea that, both ethnically and culturally, the 30 million Korean people belong to one nation. The Korean people long for reunification, and they are heartbroken by the division of their homeland. He said that, unfortunately, the negotiations on the Korean issue in Geneva were abruptly interrupted. We demand the resumption of these negotiations through political conferences to ensure the establishment of a unified, free, and independent Korea. He said, we declare that the Korean people themselves have the inalienable right to determine their own destiny, and demand that all foreign troops withdraw from Korean territory.

Singh said that the United Nations no longer arouses the faith it once inspired in people's hearts. Some countries are using the United Nations for their selfish purposes and are failing the great hopes that the United Nations once aroused. He said, but we believe that despite all these shortcomings, the people of the world do hope that the United Nations will still play the great role it should play in international affairs. What is needed is not to amend the Charter of the United Nations, but to restore the inherent spirit of the Charter of the United Nations. We request all countries, especially the great powers, to restore the original spirit of the Charter.

Singh talked about the issue of racial discrimination, saying that many countries completely ignore all solemn international declarations and practice egregious racial discrimination. He said, we call on the people of Asia and the people of other countries to unite and exert moral pressure on these countries to end discriminatory practices that ignore basic human rights.

Singh said when talking about the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence that, after the joint statement of the Prime Ministers of India and China, Myanmar and eight other countries also expressed their approval of these principles. The Prime Minister of India emphasized in the Indian Parliament on March 31, "The Five Principles are Asia's challenge to the rest of the world, and every country must give a straightforward answer to this challenge." The Indian delegation hopes that the representatives of Asian countries gathered here will accept this challenge and will agree to these five principles without reservation.

Singh finally said that we are gathered here at the beginning of a new era in history. We have had long historical ties in the past. We have had glorious periods that have always been our precious heritage, and the memory of those days will forever remain in our hearts. At the same time, we have also had periods of stagnation, exploitation, and national humiliation, dark and bleak periods. We have now emerged from this valley. There is a new inspiring force in the hearts of millions of you. We are moving forward, we are dedicated to safeguarding freedom, this hard-won freedom that we must never lose again. We are dedicated to peace, because peace represents the inherent spirit of Asia. We are not meeting here in the spirit of any narrow regionalism or nationalism. We are meeting here as a part of all mankind to discuss our problems and the problems of the world, and to seek solutions in a spirit of friendship and cooperation with the people of all countries. Let us solve these problems together, we will move forward hand in hand, and open up a bright future for our people.

    在亚洲国家会议全体会议上
    辛格关于政治问题的报告（摘要）
    印度国会议员、前印度驻联合国朝鲜委员会首席代表阿努普·辛格博士代表出席亚洲国家会议的印度代表团在七日全体会议上就政治问题作了报告。
    辛格说，亚洲的新的觉醒是一件有深远历史意义的事件。今天，觉醒了的亚洲再一次充满了再度燃烧起来的活力。我们已经决定，从现在起，我们将决定我们自己的命运，我们决不容许任何人背着我们来决定我们的命运。亚洲的这种对共同命运的新的觉醒是从我们共同的处境和最近为争取自由所进行的共同斗争中产生的。
    辛格说，印度和中国总理宣布的五项原则使得新亚洲站在世界事务方面的最前列，亚洲已上升到一种新的地位。
    由于尼赫鲁总理和周恩来总理发表了联合声明，世界各国已得知，时代已经改变了。亚洲两个最大的国家已经团结起来，不是为了集体的侵略，而是为了集体的和平。
    从这以后，亚洲的国家接连地表示赞同这五项原则，亚洲的团结在今天已成为事实了。
    在谈到禁止和监督大规模毁灭性武器时，辛格说，今天使人类感到最可怕的就是大规模毁灭性武器。是这种死亡和毁灭的凶恶的使者带给我们灭亡呢，还是我们把原子能用于建设性的目的，这就是我们时代的挑战。他说，国际气氛正不断由于“大规模报复”和对各国人民使用核子武器的威胁而受到毒害。世界各地的著名科学家、公众领袖和宗教领袖都已一致抗议原子弹爆炸试验和在制造大规模毁灭性武器方面的疯狂竞赛。
    辛格说，我们建议：一，必须立刻禁止制造大规模毁灭性武器。二，目前的储存应该予以销毁。三，在签订禁止制造核子武器的国际协定之前，应该订立协定规定必须停止一切进一步的实验。
    在谈到殖民主义和外国对亚洲国家内政的干涉时，辛格说，经过了长期斗争之后，大多数的亚洲人民终于获得了他们的自由。但是，在亚洲和其他地方仍然有某些地区的人民没有获得自由，遭受着压迫和剥削。我们认为，在目前的时代中使用明目张胆的暴力是对人类的文明的良心的一个罪行。他提到印度支那问题说，去年在日内瓦达成的关于印度支那的协议是和平协商的胜利，而且结束了印度支那历史上可怕的一章。我们要求必须结束外国对印度支那事务的干涉。我们谴责违反停战协定的行为，我们要求必须忠实地和认真地遵守停战协定。
    辛格说，西伊里安是继续加剧国际紧张局势的另外一个危险地点。荷兰和印度尼西亚的谈判应当立即恢复以便把西伊里安归还印度尼西亚。我们完全支持印度尼西亚人民认为西伊里安是印度尼西亚的不可分割的一部分的主张。
    辛格接着谈到台湾问题。他说，历史上，台湾一向是中国的一部分。一八九四年中日战争后，依据马关条约该岛被割让给日本。第二次世界大战期间，三大国开罗会议于一九四三年十二月宣布：日本强夺自中国的一切领土，诸如满洲、台湾和澎湖将归还中华民国。他说，杜鲁门总统在一九五零年一月五日宣布：“美国无意在台湾获取特别权利或特权或建立军事基地，美国政府不拟遵循任何足以把美国卷入中国内争中的途径。”全然不顾这种郑重的保证，现在有人捏造了“两个中国”这种荒谬论调来掩饰真正的目的。而麦克阿瑟将军却以其特有的粗卤作风把这种目的泄露无遗。他说：“从这条岛屿锁链，我们可以用空军控制自海参崴至新加坡的每一个亚洲海港，并可防止任何进入太平洋的敌对行动。”现在，遭到唾弃的蒋介石政权已经被扶植起来，台湾已被美国用作军事基地。他说，中国对这种政策的反应是不可避免的。中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来说：“我现在代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府声明：杜鲁门六月二十七日的声明和美国海军的行动，乃是对于中国领土的武装侵略，对于联合国宪章的彻底破坏。”他又说：中国人民必将万众一心为解放台湾而奋斗。
    印度对于台湾和中国沿海岛屿问题的态度已由印度总统和总理表示得十分明白。无论从历史上、地理上和法律上看，台湾都是属于中国的，台湾土地上驻扎外国军队就是公然侵犯中国主权。我们要求一切美国军队撤出台湾和沿海岛屿，并立即把这些岛屿归还给中国。
    辛格说，果阿是印度的不可分割的一部分。印度政府曾作了一贯的努力以便和葡萄牙进行谈判，但是葡萄牙却以漠不关心、缄默和经常轻蔑地拒绝的态度和粗暴的武力威胁来对待这种和平建议。他说，我们认为应该要求葡萄牙政府停止恐怖统治，释放全部政治犯，给予果阿居民以正常的公民的自由。应该敦促葡萄牙政府同印度就和平移交果阿问题进行谈判。他说，马来亚人民得不到自由，马来亚是大规模逮捕、枪杀和焚毁成千上万人民的家园的地方。另外，怯尼亚、摩洛哥、突尼斯和非洲其他地方的人民的境遇也很悲惨。我们对他们争取自由的英勇斗争寄与最深切的同情。
    辛格说，我们要求，完全结束世界各地的恶毒的殖民制度，任何地方受别人统治的人民都必须享有他们的自由；我们要求，一切外国军队应当撤出亚洲，停止一切外国对亚洲国家内政的干涉。
    在谈到军事条约和外国基地时，辛格说，亚洲国家认为军事条约和基地是对它们的独立的一种新的和阴险的侵犯。印度政府和人民曾毫不含糊地斥责了“东南亚防御组织”。我们认为，东南亚条约组织是一个军事集团，它分裂了亚洲人民，并且是“亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策的一部分。我们认为这是一个险恶的阴谋，企图在一种新的伪装下，继续和重新使外国统治亚洲某些部分。他说，这个会议应该表明它绝对和完全地反对一切军事条约，并要求把亚洲土地上的一切外国军队都撤走，一切外国基地都取消。
    辛格谈到中华人民共和国在联合国中的地位说，中华人民共和国的出现是一个伟大的历史事件。这个共和国已经在整个中国大陆上建立和巩固了它的权力。这个人民共和国已经得到了若干国家的承认。但是，还有一些国家却以完全捏造和立不住脚的理由来继续拒绝承认。他说，中国是联合国创始会员国之一，并且在安全理事会拥有常任理事国的席位。问题是：谁可以有合法的权利要求在联合国代表中国呢？是蒋介石的代表，还是人民共和国的代表呢？如果继续保持所谓蒋介石的代表来代表中国发言那种捏造的说法，那是对常识的侮辱。
    他说，故意无视中国的新政府是极端严重的政治错误，因为没有中国的积极和充分的合作，任何有关亚洲的重大问题都无法解决；没有中国的参加，联合国面临的任何重大问题都无法解决。他说，我们建议：一切亚洲国家都承认中华人民共和国，它的代表应该在安全理事会取得席位，蒋介石的代表应该被驱逐出去。
    在谈到亚洲国家之间的外交关系正常化时，辛格说，我们建议所有的亚洲国家应该彼此建立直接的正式关系，在战争期间曾经断绝的关系应该恢复并使之正常化。
    辛格在谈到和平统一朝鲜问题时说，不论在种族上和文化上，三千万朝鲜人民属于一个民族。朝鲜人民都渴望统一，他们祖国的分裂使他们痛心。他说，不幸，在日内瓦的关于朝鲜问题的谈判被突然中断了。我们要求通过政治会议恢复这些谈判以保证成立一个统一的、自由的和独立的朝鲜。他说，我们宣布，朝鲜人民自己具有不可让予的权利来决定他们自己的命运，并且要求一切外国军队撤出朝鲜领土。
    辛格说，联合国不再激起它一度曾在人们心中鼓舞起来的信念。某些国家正在为了它们自私的目的而利用联合国，正在辜负联合国所一度唤起的巨大希望。他说，但是我们认为，尽管有这一切缺点，世界人民的确希望联合国将仍旧在国际事务中发挥它本来应该起的巨大作用。需要的并不是修改联合国宪章，而是恢复联合国宪章固有的精神。我们请求一切国家，特别是大国，来恢复宪章的本来的精神。
    辛格谈到种族歧视问题时说，许多国家完全无视所有庄严的国际宣言，实行恶劣的种族歧视。他说，我们要求亚洲人民和其他国家的人民一致地对这些国家施以道义上的压力，以终止那些无视基本人权的歧视行为。
    辛格在谈到和平共处的五项原则时说，在印度总理和中国总理的联合声明发表之后，缅甸和其他八个国家也表示赞同这些原则。印度总理三月三十一日在印度国会中着重宣称，“五大原则是亚洲对世界其余部分的挑战，而每一个国家都必须对这种挑战给予直截了当的回答。”印度代表团希望，聚集在这里的亚洲各国代表将接受这种挑战，将毫无保留地同意这五项原则。
    辛格最后说，我们是在历史的新时期开始的时候在这里聚会的。我们在过去曾有过悠久的历史性的联系。我们有过一直是我们的宝贵遗产的光荣的时期，而对这些日子的记忆永存在我们的心中。同时我们也有过停滞、剥削和民族屈辱的时期、黑暗惨淡的时期。我们现在已经走出了这种幽谷。在你们千百万人的心坎中有着新的鼓舞力量。我们在迈步前进，我们献身于维护自由，这种我们决不可再失去的得来不易的自由。我们献身于和平，因为和平代表着亚洲的内在精神。我们并不是本着任何狭隘的地区主义或民族主义的精神而在这里开会的。我们作为全人类的一部分在这里开会，以讨论我们的问题和全世界的问题，在本着友爱精神和各国人民进行合作的情况下寻求解决办法。让我们一起来解决这些问题，我们将携手并进，为我们的人民开辟远大的前途。　（新华社新德里八日电）
