Lenin's Doctrine on the Transition Period
    —Speech at the Commemorative Meeting of the 85th Anniversary of Lenin's Birth by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Yang Xianzhen, President of the Marxist-Leninist Academy
    Lenin was the greatest proletarian revolutionary in human history after Marx and Engels. Lenin's lifelong struggle pointed out the correct path to complete liberation for the working class and all working people of the world. He led the heroic people of Russia to break through the chains of world capitalism first in one-sixth of the world's land area, establish the political power of the working class, eliminate the system of human exploitation, and turn the ideals of Marx and Engels' scientific communism into reality, opening up a new historical era for human society—the era of socialism and communism. Lenin's great cause has now not only achieved complete victory in the Soviet Union, but has also achieved victory in eleven countries with a population of over 700 million outside the Soviet Union. This victory is now shining brightly like the rising sun on the exploited people and oppressed nations in the world who have not yet been liberated.
    After the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution and the establishment of the working class regime, Lenin immediately set about formulating a complete scientific program to transform economically backward Russia into an advanced and powerful socialist country. This program stipulated: the implementation of national socialist industrialization, the full development of heavy industry, the implementation of the electrification of the entire national economy, the implementation of a cooperative plan to transform Russian agriculture based on socialist principles, and the implementation of a cultural revolution.
    Since China completed the democratic revolution and established the People's Republic of China, it has entered the historical stage of transition from a new democratic society to a socialist society. Lenin's doctrine on the transition period has great practical significance for our socialist construction.
    (I)
    Marx once pointed out: "Between capitalist and communist society lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat." [1] Lenin developed this idea of ​​Marx and formulated a complete doctrine on the transition period.
    Lenin pointed out that after the proletariat seizes power, it must use its political dominance to solve the economic tasks of socialism. To solve the economic tasks of socialism means not only developing an industrial system based on heavy industry, but also transferring the national economy, including agriculture, to the technical basis of large-scale production, and changing the national economy, including multiple economic components, into a single socialist economy. Therefore, the central task of the Party in the transition period is to realize the country's socialist industrialization, and the central link of socialist industrialization is to develop heavy industry first. Heavy industry is the cornerstone of the socialist national economy. Only on the basis of developing heavy industry can the entire national economy be developed, the country's economic independence be guaranteed, and the country's powerful national defense forces be established. Lenin repeatedly instructed: "There is only one real and sole foundation for building a socialist society, and that is large-scale industry. ... Without highly equipped large-scale industry, there can be no talk of socialism in general, especially for a country of peasants." [2] "To save Russia, it is not enough to have a bumper harvest in the peasant economy, nor is it enough to have a thriving light industry that supplies consumer goods to the peasants—we must also have heavy industry." [3] "Without saving heavy industry, without restoring heavy industry, we cannot build any industry at all, and without industry, we cannot maintain our position as an independent country at all." [4]
    Lenin especially emphasized the role and significance of electrification. Lenin believed that the implementation of electrification is not only a decisive condition for the development of the national economy, but also a decisive condition for the transformation of the small-scale peasant economy and the elimination of the capitalist economic foundation throughout the country. Lenin pointed out: "Only when the proletarian state power finally overcomes all resistance from the exploiters, ensures that its position is fully consolidated and its orders can be fully implemented, and reorganizes the entire industry on the basis of large-scale collective production and the latest technology (based on the electrification of the entire economy), can the victory of socialism over capitalism and the consolidation of socialism be said to be guaranteed." [5] This shows that the reconstruction of the entire national economy on the basis of electrification will guide the socialist components to overcome the capitalist components, and will enable the dominant small-scale peasant economy to embark on the road of socialist transformation. He said: "Only when the country is electrified, when industry, agriculture, and transportation are all built on the technical basis of modern large-scale industry, can we be said to have achieved final victory." [6] "If after ten to twenty years of electrification, the individualism of small peasants and their free trade in local circulation are not at all terrible. Without electrification, it will inevitably return to capitalism in any case." [7] "Only the material foundation, only technology, only the large-scale application of tractors and machines in agriculture, only the large-scale implementation of electrification, can solve the problem of relations with small peasants, and can restore their entire psychology to soundness." [8]
    Lenin pointed out that in order to accumulate sufficient funds to build large-scale industry, it is necessary to implement strict economy in the economy. To this end, Lenin once called: "Calculate money accurately and honestly, save economically, do not be lazy, do not steal public property for personal gain, and observe the strictest discipline in labor." [9] "At the cost of our country's great economic savings, to accumulate all the smallest funds in order to develop our large-scale machine industry, develop electrification, and develop water power to extract peat, etc." [10] He also said: "In any case, we should reduce the number of our state organs, and we must save as much as possible. We are implementing savings in all aspects, even in school expenses." [11] "Heavy industry needs state subsidies. If we cannot find such subsidies, we cannot become a civilized country, let alone a socialist country." [12]
    The correctness of Lenin's principle of giving priority to the development of heavy industry has been fully confirmed in the entire process of socialist construction in the Soviet Union. Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause, developed Lenin's argument on giving priority to the development of heavy industry. When Stalin talked about the tasks of the national economy, he emphasized that reducing the development speed of heavy industry "would be suicide, it would be destroying our entire industry, including light industry. This would be abandoning our slogan of industrialization and turning our country into an appendage of the capitalist economic system." [13] Because the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, unswervingly followed the path indicated by Lenin, the Soviet Union transformed itself from a backward agricultural country into a powerful industrialized and collectivized agricultural country in a short period of time.
    Giving priority to the development of heavy industry is an unshakable principle in building a socialist national economy.
    (II)
    Lenin believed that transforming agriculture according to socialist principles is an inseparable part of socialist construction. He said: "If the originally impoverished peasant economy remains unchanged, then there is no way to talk about firmly establishing a socialist society." [14] Lenin repeatedly pointed out the importance and complexity of educating and transforming peasants. On the eve of his death, Lenin, while suffering from illness, also wrote the brilliant and immortal work "On Cooperation," which theoretically fully demonstrated the cooperative plan of attracting peasants to participate in socialist construction.
    Lenin believed that general cooperation, especially agricultural cooperation, is a form that individual peasants can easily accept and understand for transitioning to socialism. Because this is the best form of combining private interests with public interests under the condition that private interests are subordinate to the interests of the whole. It is not only convenient to instill collective principles in peasants and for state inspection and supervision, but also takes care of private interests, because cooperation is the only correct way to improve peasants' lives and eliminate poverty.
    Lenin pointed out that attracting peasants to participate in socialist construction through cooperatives should be a gradual process. Only when the superiority of the collective economy is actually shown to the peasants can the peasants be attracted to our side. Attempts to transform them forcibly by rapid means are completely absurd. It takes a gradual development process to get millions of peasants to participate in cooperatives, because attracting peasants to cooperatives requires not only the entire economic development to help agriculture, but also the peasants to have cultural knowledge, but also the peasants to have personal experience. All of this takes time.
    Lenin's cooperative plan is based on the political and economic achievements of the great October Socialist Revolution. Under the capitalist system, thinking that socialism can be reached through "cooperation" is just a fantasy, using class peace to replace class struggle. However, under the conditions of the proletarian dictatorship, when all the main means of production are in the hands of the working class, the role of cooperation has undergone a fundamental change. Lenin said: "In our country, the development of simple cooperation is equivalent to the development of socialism." [15]
    Socialist construction in rural areas means the fundamental transformation of the entire rural relations of production. That is to say, not only must the rich peasant class be eliminated, but also the laboring peasants must completely get rid of the old road they have been accustomed to for thousands of years and turn to a new socialist development path. However, peasants have dual characteristics: as laborers, they can move towards socialism; as private owners, their spontaneous tendency is towards the capitalist road. Socialism will not spontaneously emerge from individual peasants. Therefore, the proletarian dictatorship is the political prerequisite for building a socialist society, and the worker-peasant alliance and the proletariat's leadership over the peasants are important guarantees for transforming the peasants. The proletariat, which has seized power, must lead the peasants. In addition to leading and helping the peasants with socialist industry, the proletariat must also politically educate the peasants to raise the peasants' socialist awareness. Lenin pointed out that the superiority of socialist agriculture should be patiently promoted to the peasants thousands of times, and the peasants must be educated through practical life, because the voluntary consent of the peasants must be obtained in order to realize the socialist transformation of agriculture. Lenin said: "Since it is said that voluntary consent must be obtained, that is to say, the peasants must be persuaded, and the peasants must be persuaded in practice." [16] Lenin also pointed out that some preferential treatment should be given to cooperatives in finance, and the cooperatives should be loaned with state funds. Because the emergence of each social system is accompanied by considerable class financial assistance, the emergence of "free" capitalism has cost many millions of rubles. The social system that we should help at present is the cooperative system.
    Lenin's brilliant cooperative plan theoretically creatively demonstrated the problem of solving the most difficult historical task after the proletariat seized power, that is, the problem of turning millions of small private farmers to the socialist road. Lenin's theory of cooperation is the program for laboring peasants to move towards socialism, the most important ideological weapon for the Party and the government to carry out the socialist transformation of the small commodity peasant economy, and the foundation of the Party's policy towards peasants. Lenin's theory of cooperation enabled the Soviet working class and laboring peasants to form a close alliance, finally completely defeating capitalism economically and building a completely socialist society.
    (III)
    Lenin believed that an important condition for realizing the socialist construction plan is to make every effort to develop the connection between state industry and the peasant economy. Therefore, Lenin stipulated the Party's "New Economic Policy" during the transition period. The social conditions on which the New Economic Policy is based are: on the one hand, the working class's state has grasped the economic lifeline of the country; on the other hand, the vast peasant economy is still a small-scale production economy. The essence of the New Economic Policy implemented under such conditions is an economic alliance between the working class and the peasants. It is to use the conditions of commodity production and the market to enable socialist components to defeat capitalist components, so as to facilitate the building of a socialist economy. Lenin said: "To unite with the peasant masses, that is, with ordinary laboring peasants, and to begin to move forward, the speed of which is immeasurably slower than we hope, extremely slow, but here the entire masses will truly move forward with us. At a certain time, this movement will accelerate to a speed that we cannot dream of now." [17]
    Lenin pointed out that sharp class struggle inevitably exists during the transition period. The New Economic Policy is a life-and-death struggle between capitalism and socialism. The question of "who defeats whom" is posed in this way. The proletariat must use its political rule and the economic lifeline it controls to squeeze out and finally eliminate the capitalist economy.
    Shortly after the October Revolution, Lenin put forward the policy on state capitalism, and re-discussed this policy during the implementation of the New Economic Policy. Lenin considered that under the condition that small producers still exist, under the condition that the foundation of capitalism—the small-scale peasant economy—still exists in large numbers, it is necessary to adopt a policy of guiding the development of capitalism to the track of state capitalism within a certain range. Lenin believed: "Whoever is the organizer of state capitalist enterprises can turn it into his own assistant." State capitalism under the conditions of the proletarian dictatorship "is a kind of capitalism that we can allow and should allow, and a kind of capitalism that we can restrict and should restrict." [18] Adopting the policy of state capitalism within a certain period and a certain scope during the transition period is not for the sake of capitalism, but for the sake of socialism. Lenin said: "The whole question—whether theoretical or practical—is to find the right method, how to guide the inevitable (inevitable to some extent and for a certain period) development of capitalism to the track of state capitalism. What conditions must this rely on, and how to ensure that state capitalism will be transformed into socialism in the near future?" [19] When adopting the policy of state capitalism, Lenin also pointed out that this "is a continuation of another form of class struggle, and it is by no means replacing class struggle with class peace." [20]
    (IV)
    The doctrine on cultural revolution and the construction of socialist culture is also an important part of Lenin's doctrine on the transition period, and it is a part of the socialist construction program. Lenin pointed out that building a socialist society requires a high level of culture, and without a complete cultural revolution, building socialism cannot be realized. Lenin gave a full evaluation of the cultural revolution and socialist cultural construction. He said: "With this cultural revolution, our country will be enough to be called a completely socialist country." [21]
    Lenin directly linked socialist construction with improving the cultural level of the working people. He believed that consolidating the strength of the Soviet state and building socialism depended on the awareness and enthusiasm of the workers and peasants, as well as their degree of understanding of the tasks. Improving the awareness and enthusiasm of the workers and peasants relied on the work of education and persuasion. At the beginning of the transition period, the phenomenon that the majority of the laboring masses left over from the old Russian era were illiterate became a serious obstacle to educating the masses. In 1920, when Lenin talked about the national electrification plan, he pointed out: electricity is the technical basis of modern large-scale production. If the cultural level of the working people is not improved, it is impossible to master modern complex technologies, and it is impossible to realize the plan of electrifying the entire national economy. Lenin said: "It must be known and remembered: it is impossible to implement electrification when we still have illiteracy." [22] In 1923, Lenin pointed out in the article "On Cooperation" that improving the cultural level of the laboring peasants is a condition for guiding the scattered small-scale peasant economy to the socialist track. Lenin wrote: "The condition of complete cooperation includes the high cultural level of the peasants (precisely the broad masses of peasants), that is, without a complete cultural revolution, complete cooperation cannot be realized." [23] Improving the cultural level of the laboring people first requires "everyone to be literate" and "have sufficient knowledge." [24] Therefore, Lenin advocated vigorously launching a campaign to eliminate illiteracy.
    Lenin also pointed out that the task of the cultural revolution is not only limited to seeking basic knowledge of enlightenment, but also to guide the laboring masses to participate in collective life, participate in state management, and participate in socialist construction. The cultural revolution is to combine cultural and educational work with political education work, that is to say, improving the cultural level of the laboring people and ideological transformation must be combined with each other. In short, the cultural revolution is socialist education for the laboring people. Lenin especially emphasized the importance of carrying out socialist education for the laboring peasants and intellectuals during the transition period. He believed that helping the laboring peasants overcome bourgeois habits and traditions and cultivate socialist spirit is an organic part of socialist cultural construction. In the process of educating the petty bourgeoisie, the proletariat also re-educates itself, cleanses itself of the petty-bourgeois prejudices it has been infected with, and develops its organizational and leadership skills. In short, improving the cultural level of the laboring people, mastering scientific and technological knowledge, cultivating intellectuals loyal to the socialist cause, and cultivating a large number of cultural cadres and administrative cadres who can engage in state management are very important things during the transition period.
    Lenin pointed out that carrying out cultural revolution and socialist cultural construction under the conditions of the proletarian dictatorship is not a spontaneous process, but a process that is planned, organized, and guided by the Communist Party and the Soviet state. In the conversation between Lenin and Zetkin in 1920, when discussing cultural issues, Lenin emphasized that the Party and the Soviet state must not stand by and let culture develop spontaneously, but should have a complete plan to guide the process of cultural construction. In the book "Impressions of Lenin," Zetkin recalled Lenin's remarks: "Communists must not stand idly by with their hands in their pockets, letting the chaotic situation stir arbitrarily. We must consciously strive to guide this development, to form and determine its results."
    Lenin believed that the cultural revolution and socialist cultural construction must be planned, organized, and led, so as to ensure that the content of socialist cultural construction has a high degree of ideological principle. Soviet culture is the culture with the highest degree of popular character. It is the culture with socialist ideology and Bolshevik party spirit. It has the content of the mutual connection between Soviet patriotism and proletarian internationalism, and it also has lively and diverse national forms. All of this is inseparable from the planned organization and leadership of the Communist Party and the Soviet state.
    (V)
    Under the leadership of the faithful successors to Lenin's cause, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its great leader Stalin, the Soviet people, based on Lenin's doctrine on the transition period, have built a backward country into a country with a powerful industry, collectivized agriculture, and a high degree of culture like today. When the Soviet Union was just starting to build socialism, Lenin not only foresaw that the Soviet Union's construction of socialism had international significance, but also foresaw that the road to socialism in various countries would not be the same across the board. Due to the different social conditions of each country, the characteristics in the economic structure, and the characteristics in the process of revolutionary development, some differences in the path to socialism in each country will inevitably be created. Therefore, Lenin pointed out: "The specific conditions and forms of this transition depend on the conditions under which the movement to establish socialism begins, and they must be and should be diverse." [25]
    As early as ten years ago, at the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China, in the report "On Coalition Government," Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "After the new democratic political conditions are obtained, the Chinese people and their government must take concrete steps to gradually establish heavy and light industries within a few years, so as to transform China from an agricultural country into an industrial country." He also said: "Without industry, there will be no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity." In 1949, the People's Republic of China was established, establishing the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. Thus, the Chinese revolution began to enter a new revolutionary stage, namely the socialist revolutionary stage. In 1952, when the restoration of the national economy was about to end, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, based on Lenin's doctrine on the transition period, summarized the experience since the establishment of the People's Republic of China and put forward the Party's general line during the transition period. This general line is to gradually realize the country's socialist industrialization in a period of about three five-year plans, and at the same time gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, in order to achieve the goal of building a socialist society in our country. This general line has been incorporated into the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which was adopted by the First Session of the First National People's Congress on September 20, 1954, and consolidated it in legal form as the general task for the Chinese people to strive for during the transition period.
    At the same time as the Party put forward the general line for the transition period, it began to formulate its own draft of the first five-year plan for developing the national economy, based on Lenin's doctrine on the transition period and the experience of the Soviet Union in building a socialist society, combined with the actual situation of China's social and economic development. This draft of the first five-year plan specifically stipulated the tasks of developing the national economy from 1953 to 1957. This is a major step towards realizing the Party's general line. This draft plan has been discussed and approved by the Party's National Conference held in late March this year. The Party's National Conference also adopted the "Resolution on the Draft of the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the People's Republic of China," and in the resolution called on all Party comrades to, under the leadership of the Central Committee, "unite the masses of people of all ethnic groups in the country, work diligently, overcome difficulties, strive to increase production, practice strict economy, and strive to complete and overfulfill this plan." The resolution also said that this draft plan should be submitted to the Second Session of the First National People's Congress for deliberation and adoption.
    The basic task of our first five-year plan can be summarized as follows: to concentrate the main forces on developing heavy industry, to carry out industrial construction with the 156 units designed by the Soviet Union to help our country as the center, consisting of 694 construction units above the quota, and to establish the preliminary foundation for our country's socialist industrialization; to develop some collectively owned agricultural production cooperatives, to develop handicraft cooperatives, and to establish the preliminary foundation for the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts; to basically incorporate the capitalist economy into various forms of state capitalism, and to establish the foundation for the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce.
    The draft of the first five-year plan is an important economic program for the Communist Party of China to lead the people of the whole country to strive to realize the general task of the transition period. Since 1953, the Communist Party of China has guided the people to launch large-scale socialist construction work based on this economic program. Because the Chinese working class and all the laboring people resolutely implemented the socialist construction plan formulated by the Party, our country has made great achievements in developing the national economy, and the achievements in developing industry, especially heavy industry, are particularly remarkable. According to the basic tasks of our country's first five-year plan, the focus of our industrial development is heavy industry, because to develop agriculture and transform individual agriculture into collectivized agriculture, it is impossible without heavy industry; to develop transportation, it is impossible without heavy industry; to develop light industry and systematically improve people's lives, it is also impossible without heavy industry. In addition, our country is still surrounded by imperialism, and the imperialist aggression war is constantly threatening us. We must strengthen our national defense forces and establish a strong and modern People's Liberation Army to protect the security of our motherland. For this reason, it is even more impossible without heavy industry. Therefore, developing heavy industry is the central link in our country's realization of socialist industrialization and the establishment of strong national defense forces. This is in line with Lenin's idea of industrialization.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, pointed out that the country's socialist industrialization is the main body of our socialist construction, and the transformation of agriculture and handicrafts and the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce are two important components of socialist construction, which are inseparable from socialist industrialization.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Without the socialization of agriculture, there will be no complete and solid socialism." [26] For thousands of years, peasants have been poor individual economies. "The only way to overcome this situation is to gradually collectivize. And the only way to achieve collectivization, according to Lenin, is through cooperatives." [27] Comrade Mao Zedong earnestly admonished us to follow Lenin's principle of patiently educating peasants. He said: "The serious problem is to educate the peasants," [28] "to help the peasants, under the principle of voluntariness, gradually organize into agricultural production cooperatives and other cooperatives." [29] The "Resolution on Mutual Aid and Cooperation in Agricultural Production" and the "Resolution on Developing Agricultural Production Cooperatives" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China specifically embody the spirit of agricultural collectivization instructed by Lenin. The mutual aid and cooperation movement currently being carried out in our country is based on Lenin's theory of cooperation. The specific path for our country to implement socialist transformation of agriculture is to go through simple mutual aid groups with common labor, permanent mutual aid groups with some division of labor and a small amount of public property on the basis of common labor, agricultural production cooperatives with land shares and unified management with more public property, and then to more advanced agricultural production cooperatives (that is, collective farms) with a complete socialist collective peasant public ownership system.
    It is impossible for two opposite relations of production, socialism and capitalism, to develop in parallel in a country without interfering with each other. If it does not go to a socialist society, it will go to a capitalist society, and the latter is not allowed by the people of our country. Taking the socialist road is the inevitable trend of our country's historical development. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, pointed out that under the specific conditions of China, transforming capitalist industry and commerce through various forms of state capitalism, that is, first gradually transforming capitalist industry and commerce into state capitalist enterprises, and second gradually transforming state capitalist enterprises into socialist enterprises, is not only necessary, but also possible. The practice of the past five years has proved that the current policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce adopted by our country is indeed a feasible policy, and this policy is precisely the specific application of the policy on state capitalism proposed by Lenin under Chinese conditions.
    Implementing cultural revolution is also one of the important undertakings of our Party during the transition period. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in the report to the Seventh National Congress of the Party that the disasters given to the Chinese people by national oppression and feudal oppression include the disasters of national culture. He listed eliminating illiteracy from 80% of the population as an important task of the new China, and especially talked about peasants, believing that they are the main target of the Chinese cultural movement at the current stage. Appropriate and resolute steps should be taken to eliminate all enslaved, feudal, and fascist cultures and education. To establish our own new national, scientific, and mass culture and education. To take the new culture created by the Soviet Union as an example for us to build people's culture. When China's democratic revolution won victory throughout the country and the Chinese revolution was about to enter the stage of socialist revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in the opening speech at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Consultative Conference: "With the arrival of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear. The era when the Chinese people were considered uncivilized has passed. We will appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture." In the opening speech at the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Mao Zedong said again: "...Prepare to build our current economically and culturally backward country into a great industrialized country with a high degree of modern culture within several five-year plans."
    Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, our Party and country have taken many important measures in the cultural revolution. First of all, our country's school education has developed greatly, and the proportion of workers' and peasants' children in students at all levels has increased year by year. In order to cultivate new intellectuals from workers' and peasants' backgrounds, workers' and peasants' short-term middle schools have been established, and ideological transformation movements have been carried out among the broad masses of intellectuals. Labor education has been emphasized in primary and secondary school education. Our country's scientific and cultural arts have also made considerable development and important contributions in the past few years. The work of eliminating illiteracy has already begun. This cultural revolution is also being promoted in minority areas based on specific conditions. In recent years, more than 100,000 cadres from minority ethnic groups have been trained through schools and other methods. What is even more worth pointing out is the recent movement led and launched by our Party to widely publicize dialectical materialism and criticize bourgeois idealism. At present, there are approximately 5 million cadres and intellectuals with reading ability in the Party, the army, the cultural and educational system, the economic system, and other departments and various mass organizations throughout the country. This movement to publicize materialism must be carried out over a long period of time so that the vast majority of them (for example, 3 million people) can understand the difference between materialism and idealism, understand the basic content of dialectical materialism, and educate the broad masses of people with low cultural levels with materialistic ideas through them. Publicizing and educating the philosophical materialistic ideas of Marxism-Leninism is the main content of our Party's ideological education. Without the extensive publicity and education of the philosophical materialistic ideas of Marxism-Leninism as a foundation, we cannot cultivate socialist culture on our land. And without socialist culture, we cannot build a complete socialist country. The in-depth education of the philosophical materialistic ideas of Marxism-Leninism will play an immeasurable role in the construction of our socialist cause.
    As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, China is now in a new historical period. Carrying out socialist revolution and realizing the Party's general line in a country with 600 million people and economic and cultural backwardness is by no means an easy task, and it will definitely encounter many difficulties. However, if we compare the conditions of our country's transition period with the conditions of the Soviet Union's transition period, our confidence in building socialism will increase a hundredfold. When the Soviet Union began to build socialism, it was the only socialist country in the world. In terms of national assistance, it was not only isolated and helpless, but also surrounded by imperialist countries, which wanted to put it out at all times. It has endured many unimaginable difficulties. But no matter how great the difficulties, the Bolshevik Party armed with Marxism-Leninism cannot overcome them. Under the leadership of Lenin and his successor Stalin, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union finally swept away all difficulties and built a socialist society. When we start to build socialism today, first of all, we are not building socialism in isolation, but under the superior condition of having a socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. We have Lenin's doctrine on the transition period as a pointer, the Soviet Union's infinitely rich practical experience in building a socialist society as a model, and the Soviet Union's selfless economic and technical assistance to us, the close cooperation of various people's democratic countries with us, and the degree of awareness of the people of the world has greatly improved compared to before World War II. In addition to our own many superior conditions, that is, we have the wise leadership of the united Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, we have hundreds of millions of hardworking, brave, and fearless heroic people who are willing to fight for the realization of socialism, and we have infinitely rich natural resources that can be exploited and utilized, and so on. We have the full conditions to build socialism. Although international imperialism and domestic reactionaries are still trying their best to sabotage and hinder our country's socialist construction, the people of our country must be vigilant against them. In any case, they cannot prevent the people of our country from building a socialist society. Therefore, as Comrade Mao Zedong said in the opening speech at the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, "We have full confidence in overcoming all difficulties and hardships and building our country a great socialist republic."

    列宁关于过渡时期的学说
    ——在中国共产党中央委员会纪念列宁诞生八十五周年大会上的讲话
    马克思列宁学院院长　杨献珍
    列宁是人类历史上继马克思、恩格斯之后的最伟大的无产阶级革命家。列宁一生的斗争，给全世界的工人阶级和全体劳动人民指明了达到彻底解放的正确道路。他领导俄国英雄的人民在占世界六分之一的地面上首先冲破了世界资本主义的锁链，建立起工人阶级的政权，消灭了人剥削人的制度，使马克思、恩格斯的科学共产主义的理想变成了现实，开辟了人类社会的新的历史时代——社会主义、共产主义时代。列宁的伟大事业现在不只是在苏联获得了完全的胜利，而且又在苏联以外的七亿多人口的十一个国家中获得了胜利，这种胜利现在正像旭日东升一样光辉地照耀着世界上还没有获得解放的被剥削的人民和被压迫的民族。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命获得胜利，工人阶级政权建立之后，列宁即着手制定了一个变经济落后的俄国为先进的强大的社会主义国家的完整的科学的纲领。这个纲领规定：实行国家社会主义工业化，全力发展重工业，实行全部国民经济电气化，实行以社会主义原则改造俄国农业的合作社计划，实行文化革命。
    中国自从完成了民主革命、成立了中华人民共和国之后，就进入了从新民主主义社会过渡到社会主义社会的历史阶段。列宁的关于过渡时期的学说，对于我国社会主义建设事业，具有巨大的实际意义。
    （一）
    马克思曾指出：“在资本主义社会和共产主义社会之间，有着一个前者转入后者之革命的转变时期。同这个时期相适应的也有一个政治上的过渡时期，这个时期底国家除了无产阶级底革命的专政以外，不能是别的任何东西。”〔一〕列宁发展了马克思的这一思想，制定了完整的关于过渡时期的学说。
    列宁指出，无产阶级在取得政权之后，必须利用自己政治上的统治地位来解决社会主义的经济任务。要解决社会主义的经济任务，就是不仅要发展以重工业为基础的工业体系，而且要把包括农业在内的国民经济转移到大生产的技术基础上来，把包括多种经济成份的国民经济改变成为单一的社会主义经济。因此，党在过渡时期的中心任务，就是实现国家的社会主义工业化，而社会主义工业化的中心环节，则是首先发展重工业。重工业是社会主义国民经济的基石。只有在发展重工业的基础上，才能发展整个国民经济，才能保证国家的经济独立，才能使国家建立起强大的国防力量。列宁一再地指示说：“建立社会主义社会底真正的和唯一的基础，只有一个，这就是大工业。……没有高度设备的大工业，那就一般地谈不到社会主义，对于一个农民的国度，尤其谈不到社会主义了。”〔二〕“要挽救俄国，单靠农民经济收成丰盛还不够，而且单靠供给农民消费品的轻工业情况兴旺也还不够，——我们还要有重工业。”〔三〕“不挽救重工业，不恢复重工业，我们就不能建成任何工业，而没有工业，我们就根本不能维持我们之为独立国家的地位。”〔四〕
    列宁特别注重电气化的作用和意义。列宁认为，实行电气化，不仅对于国民经济发展是一个决定性的条件，而且对于改造小农经济和在全国范围内消灭资本主义经济基础，也是一个决定性的条件。列宁指出：“只有当无产阶级国家政权最终压倒了剥削者的一切反抗，保证了自己地位完全巩固及政令能充分施行，而在大集体生产与最新（基于全部经济电气化）技术基础上改组着全部工业的时候，则社会主义对资本主义的胜利以及社会主义的巩固才可以说是有了保证。”〔五〕这说明了全部国民经济在电气化基础上的改建，将引导社会主义成份战胜资本主义成份，将使占优势的小农经济走上社会主义改造的道路。他说：“只有当国家电气化了，当工业、农业、运输业都建筑在现代化大工业的技术基础上的时候，我们才算是获得了最终的胜利。”〔六〕“如果经过十年到二十年的电气化，小农的个人主义及其在地方流通中的自由贸易就一点也不可怕。如果没有电气化，那么，无论如何都必不可避免地将恢复到资本主义去。”〔七〕“只有物质的基础，只有技术，只有在农业中大规模地运用拖拉机与机器，只有大规模地实行电气化，才能解决对小农关系的问题，才能够恢复他们的全部心理趋于健全。”〔八〕
    列宁指出，为了积累足够的资金来建设大工业，必须在经济上实行严格的节约。为此，列宁曾号召：“精确而诚实地计算金钱，节省经济，不懒惰，不盗公肥私，在劳动中遵守最严格的纪律。”〔九〕“以我国经济上极大节约的代价，来达到积累所有最小的资金，以便发展我们大规模的机器工业，发展电气化，发展水力采取泥煤等。”〔十〕又说：“我们无论如何，应当缩减我们的国家机关人员，我们必须尽量节省。我们在各方面，甚至在学校经费方面，都实行节省。”〔十一〕“重工业是需要有国家补助金的。我们如果找不到这种补助金，便不能成为文明的国家，更不必说成为社会主义的国家了。”〔十二〕
    列宁关于优先发展重工业的原理的正确性，在苏联社会主义建设的全部进程中完全得到了证实。列宁事业的伟大继承者斯大林，发展了列宁的优先发展重工业的论点。斯大林谈到国民经济的任务时着重指出，降低重工业的发展速度，“这就会是自杀，这就会是破坏我国全部工业，连轻工业也在内。这就会是离开我国工业化的口号，把我国变为资本主义经济体系的附属品。”〔十三〕由于苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下坚定不移地遵循着列宁所指示的道路，所以，在一个短时期内，苏联就从一个落后的农业国变成一个强大的工业化和农业集体化的国家了。
    优先发展重工业，在建设社会主义国民经济中，是一条不可动摇的原则。
      （二）
    列宁认为，以社会主义原则改造农业，是社会主义建设事业中不可分割的组成部分。他说：“原来贫困不堪的农民经济如果仍旧不变，那么，任何坚固地建立社会主义社会的事情也就无从谈起。”〔十四〕列宁曾屡次指出教育农民和改造农民的重要性和复杂性。列宁在他逝世的前夕，在患病中，还写了“论合作制”这篇光辉灿烂的不朽著作，在理论上全面地论证了吸引农民参加社会主义建设的合作社计划。
    列宁认为，一般合作制，特别是农业合作制，是个体农民过渡到社会主义所易于接受和了解的形式。因为这是在私人利益服从全体利益条件下，把私人利益和公共利益结合起来的最好形式。它既便于向农民灌输集体制原则，便于国家检查监督，同时又照顾到了私人的利益，因为合作制是提高农民生活、免除贫困的唯一正确的道路。
    列宁指出，经过合作社吸引农民参加社会主义建设，应该是逐步前进。只有在事实上向农民表明集体经济的优越性时，才能把农民吸引到我们方面来。企图用急速办法强迫加以改造，是完全荒谬的。要使千百万农民群众参加合作社，需要一个逐渐的发展过程，因为把农民吸引到合作社，不仅需要整个经济发展能够帮助农业，也不仅需要农民有文化知识，而且还需要有农民的亲身经验，所有这一切都是需要时间的。
    列宁的合作社计划，是建立在伟大十月社会主义革命所获得的政治与经济的成果的基础上的。在资本主义制度下，认为经过“合作制”可以到达社会主义只是一种幻想，是用阶级和平来代替阶级斗争。但在无产阶级专政的条件下，在一切主要的生产资料掌握在工人阶级手中的条件下，合作制的作用便发生了根本的变化。列宁说：“在我国，单纯的合作制发展，就等于社会主义发展。”〔十五〕
    农村的社会主义建设，意味着整个农村生产关系的根本改造，这就是说，不但要消灭富农阶级，而且要使劳动农民彻底摆脱其千百年所走惯了的旧道路，而转向一条新的社会主义发展大道。但是农民具有二重性的特点：作为劳动者，他可能走向社会主义，作为私有者，他的自发的趋向是资本主义道路。社会主义不会从个体农民中自发地产生出来。因此，无产阶级专政是建成社会主义社会的政治前提，工农联盟和无产阶级对农民的领导是改造农民的重要保证。掌握政权的无产阶级必须领导农民。无产阶级除了以社会主义的工业领导和帮助农民之外，还要在政治上教育农民，以提高农民的社会主义觉悟。列宁指出，应当耐心地千番百次地向农民宣传社会主义农业的优越性，并且必须通过实际生活来教育农民，因为必须取得农民的自愿，才能实现农业的社会主义改造。列宁说：“既然说必须求得自愿同意，也就是说，要说服农民，要在实践中说服农民。”〔十六〕列宁又指出：应当在财政上给合作社以某种优待，要用国家资金贷予合作社。因为每个社会制度的产生，都是有着相当阶级的财政帮助的，“自由”资本主义的产生是花过许多万万卢布的。现时我们所应当帮助的社会制度，就是合作社制度。
    列宁天才的合作社计划，是在理论上创造性地论证了无产阶级夺取政权后解决最困难历史任务的问题，即把千百万小私有农户转向社会主义道路的问题。列宁的合作化理论，是劳动农民走向社会主义的纲领，是党和政府对小商品农民经济进行社会主义改造工作最重要的思想武器，是党对农民政策的基础。列宁合作化的理论使苏联工人阶级和劳动农民结成亲密的联盟，终于在经济上彻底战胜了资本主义并建成了完全的社会主义社会。
      （三）
    列宁认为，实现社会主义建设计划的重要条件是尽力发展国家工业和农民经济之间的联系。因此，列宁规定了党在过渡时期的“新经济政策”。新经济政策所根据的社会条件是：一方面工人阶级的国家已经掌握了国家经济命脉；而另一方面，广大的农民经济还是小生产经济。在这种条件下实行的新经济政策的实质就是工人阶级和农民的一种经济联盟，是为了利用商品生产和市场的条件，使社会主义成份战胜资本主义成份，以利于建成社会主义经济。列宁说：“与农民群众，即与普通的劳动农民接合起来，并开始向前移动，其速度虽比我们所希望的慢得不可计量，慢到了极点，但这里整个群众却真正会和我们一同前进。到了一定的时候，这个运动就会加快到我们现在所梦想不到的速度。”〔十七〕
    列宁指出，在过渡时期必然存在着尖锐的阶级斗争。新经济政策乃是资本主义和社会主义之间的殊死斗争。“谁战胜谁”——问题就是这样摆着的。无产阶级必须利用自己的政治统治和自己所掌握的经济命脉来排挤并最后消灭资本主义经济。
    在十月革命后不久，列宁提出了关于国家资本主义的政策，并在新经济政策实施时期重新论述了这个政策。列宁考虑到在小生产者还存在的条件之下，在资本主义的根基——小农经济还大量存在的条件之下，在一定范围内，采取把资本主义的发展引导到国家资本主义的轨道上去的政策，是必要的。列宁认为：“谁是国家资本主义企业的组织者，谁就可以把它变为自己的助手。”在无产阶级专政条件下的国家资本主义，“这便是我们能够容许和应当容许的一种资本主义，是我们能够限制和应当限制的一种资本主义。”〔十八〕在过渡期间的一定时期和一定范围以内采用国家资本主义的政策，其目的不是为着资本主义，而是为着社会主义。列宁说：“全部问题——无论理论上或实践上的问题——就是要找到正当的方法，应该怎样把资本主义之不可避免的（在某种程度内和某种期限内是不可避免的）发展，引导到国家资本主义轨道上去，这必须赖有一些什么条件，怎样保证在不远将来变国家资本主义为社会主义。”〔十九〕而在采用国家资本主义政策的时候，列宁也同样指出，这“是阶级斗争另一形式的继续，而决不是用阶级和平来代替阶级斗争。”〔二十〕
      （四）
    关于文化革命和建设社会主义文化的学说，也是列宁关于过渡时期的学说的一个重要部分，是社会主义建设纲领的一部分。列宁指出，建设社会主义社会必需有高度的文化水准，如果没有整个的文化革命，建设社会主义便不可能实现。列宁对于文化革命和社会主义文化建设曾作了充分的估价，他说：“有了这文化革命，我国也就够称为完全的社会主义国家了。”〔二十一〕
    列宁把社会主义建设和提高劳动人民文化水平直接联系起来，他认为，巩固苏维埃国家力量、建设社会主义，是依赖于工人和农民的觉悟性和积极性，以及他们对任务的理解程度，而提高工农群众的觉悟性和积极性，则是依靠于教育说服的工作。在过渡时期的开始，从旧俄时代遗留下来的劳动群众中多数是文盲的现象，成为教育群众的严重障碍。一九二○年，列宁谈到国家电气化计划的时候指出：电是现代大生产的技术基础，如果不提高劳动人民的文化水平，就不可能掌握现代的复杂的技术，也就不可能实现全部国民经济电气化的计划。列宁说：“必须知道而且记住：在我们还有文盲的时候，要实行电气化是不行的。”〔二十二〕一九二三年，列宁在“论合作制”一文中指出，提高劳动农民的文化水平，是把散漫的小农经济引上社会主义轨道的条件。列宁写道：“完全合作化的条件，是包含有农民（正是广大农民群众）的高度文化水准在内，即如果没有整个的文化革命，那么，完全合作化便是不可能实现的。”〔二十三〕提高劳动人民的文化水平，首先要求“做到人人都识字”，
  “有足够的知识程度”，〔二十四〕所以列宁主张大力展开扫除文盲运动。
    列宁又指出，文化革命的任务，还不仅限于求得基本知识的启蒙工作，同时要引导劳动群众参加集体生活，参加国家管理，参加社会主义的建设。文化革命是要把文化教育工作和政治教育工作结合起来，就是说，提高劳动人民的文化水平和思想改造必须相互结合。总之，文化革命是对劳动人民的社会主义教育。列宁特别强调在过渡时期对劳动农民和知识分子进行社会主义教育的重要意义。他认为，帮助劳动农民克服资产阶级的习惯和传统，养成社会主义精神，是社会主义文化建设的一个有机部分。无产阶级在教育小资产阶级的过程中，也再教育了自己，使自己清洗掉感染到的小资产阶级偏见，并且发展了自己的组织领导才能。总之，使劳动人民提高文化水平，掌握科学技术知识，造就忠于社会主义事业的知识分子，培养大量的能够从事国家管理工作的文化干部和行政干部，是在过渡时期十分重要的事情。
    列宁指出，在无产阶级专政的条件下进行文化革命和社会主义文化建设，并不是自发的过程，而是由共产党和苏维埃国家有计划地加以组织和指导的过程。一九二○年列宁和蔡特金的会谈，论述到文化问题时，列宁强调地提到党和苏维埃国家决不能袖手旁观，让文化自流发展，而应有完备的计划，以指导文化建设的进程。蔡特金在“列宁印象记”一书中回忆列宁的谈话说：“共产党人决不可以把手插在衣袋里，听任混乱的局面随意地骚动着，我们必须有意识地努力去指导这一发展，去形成和决定它的成果。”
    列宁认为：对文化革命和社会主义文化建设必须有计划地去组织和领导，这样才能保证社会主义文化建设内容具有高度的思想原则性。苏维埃文化是最高度人民性的文化，是具有社会主义思想性和布尔什维克党性的文化，它具有苏维埃爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义相互联系的内容，也具有生动活泼的和多种多样的民族形式。这一切都是同共产党和苏维埃国家有计划地组织和领导分不开的。
      （五）
    苏联人民在列宁事业的忠实的继承者、苏联共产党及其伟大领袖斯大林的领导下，根据列宁关于过渡时期的学说，已经把一个落后的国家建设成今天那样具有强大的工业、集体化的农业和高度文化的国家。还在苏联开始着手建设社会主义的时候，列宁不仅预见到苏联建设社会主义具有国际意义，而且也预见到，各个国家向社会主义过渡的道路，并不是千篇一律，彼此完全相同的。由于各国社会的条件不同，经济结构中的特点，革命发展进程中的特点，都必然会造成各国走向社会主义的某些差别。因此，列宁指出：“这种过渡的具体条件和形式，要看为建立社会主义的运动所由开始的那些条件为转移，它们必然是而且应当是多种样式的。”〔二十五〕
    远在十年以前，在中国共产党第七次代表大会上，在“论联合政府”的报告中，毛泽东同志即曾指出：“在新民主主义的政治条件获得之后，中国人民及其政府必须采取切实的步骤，在若干年内逐步地建立重工业和轻工业，使中国由农业国变为工业国。”还说：“没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”一九四九年中华人民共和国成立，建立了工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，于是中国革命就开始进入了一个新的革命阶段，即社会主义革命阶段。一九五二年，国民经济的恢复将要结束的时候，以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央委员会，根据列宁关于过渡时期的学说，总结了中华人民共和国成立以来的经验，提出了党在过渡时期的总路线。这个总路线就是在大约三个五年计划的期间内，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，同时对于农业、手
  工业和资本主义工商业逐步实现社会主义改造，以求达到在我国建成社会主义社会的目的。这个总路线已经载入一九五四年九月二十日经第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议通过的中华人民共和国宪法中，用法律形式把它巩固起来，作为中国人民在过渡时期努力奋斗的总任务。
    党在提出过渡时期的总路线的同时，就根据列宁关于过渡时期的学说和苏联建成社会主义社会的经验，结合中国社会经济发展的实际情况，开始制定自己的发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案，这个第一个五年计划草案，具体地规定了从一九五三年到一九五七年发展国民经济的任务。这是为实现党的总路线的一个重大的步骤。这个计划草案已为本年三月下旬所举行的党的全国代表会议所讨论和通过。党的全国代表会议还通过了“关于中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案的决议”，在决议中号召全党同志要在中央的领导下，“团结全国各族人民群众，兢兢业业，克服困难，努力增产，厉行节约，为完成和超额完成这个计划而奋斗”。决议中还说要把这个计划草案提交第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议予以审议和通过。
    我们的第一个五年计划的基本任务，概括地说来就是：集中主要力量发展重工业，进行以苏联帮助我国设计的一百五十六个单位为中心的、由限额以上的六百九十四个建设单位组成的工业建设，建立我国的社会主义工业化的初步基础；发展部分集体所有制的农业生产合作社，发展手工业合作社，建立对于农业和手工业的社会主义改造的初步基础；基本上把资本主义经济分别地纳入各种形式的国家资本主义的轨道，建立对于私营工商业的社会主义改造的基础。
    第一个五年计划草案是中国共产党领导全国人民为实现过渡时期的总任务而奋斗的一个重要经济纲领，从一九五三年起，中国共产党就根据这个经济纲领引导人民展开了大规模的社会主义建设工作。由于中国工人阶级和全体劳动人民坚决执行了党所制定的社会主义建设计划，我国在发展国民经济方面取得了很大成就，而在发展工业方面特别是重工业方面的成就特别显著。根据我国的第一个五年计划的基本任务，我们发展工业的重点乃是重工业，因为要发展农业，要改造个体的农业为集体化的农业，没有重工业是不行的；要发展交通运输事业，没有重工业是不行的；要发展轻工业，有系统地改善人民生活，没有重工业也是不行的。此外，我国还处在帝国主义包围之中，帝国主义对我国的侵略战争时刻在威胁着我们。我们必须加强国防力量，建立一支强大的现代化的人民解放军，以保卫我们祖国的安全。为此，没有重工业更是不行的。所以，发展重工业，是我国实现国家的社会主义工业化和建立强大国防力量的中心环节。这是符合于列宁的工业化的思想的。
    以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央委员会指出，国家的社会主义工业化是我们的社会主义建设的主体，而对农业、手工业的改造和对资本主义工商业的改造是社会主义建设的两个重要组成部分，是和社会主义工业化不可分割的。
    毛泽东同志说：“没有农业社会化，就没有全部的巩固的社会主义。”〔二十六〕农民几千年来都是穷苦的个体经济，“克服这种状况的唯一办法，就是逐渐地集体化；而达到集体化的唯一道路，依据列宁所说，就是经过合作社”。〔二十七〕毛泽东同志谆谆告诫我们，要遵循列宁所指示的耐心教育农民的原则，他说：“严重的问题是教育农民”，〔二十八〕“帮助农民在自愿原则下，逐渐地组织在农业生产合作社及其他合作社之中”。〔二十九〕中国共产党中央“关于农业生产互助合作决议”和“关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”，具体地体现了列宁所指示的农业集体化的精神。目前我国在全国范围内开展的互助合作运动，就是以列宁关于合作化的学说为依据的。我国对农业实行社会主义改造的具体道路，就是经过简单的共同劳动的临时互助组，和在共同劳动的基础上实行某些分工分业而有少量公共财产的常年互助组，到实行土地入股、统一经营而有较多公共财产的农业生产合作社，然后再到实行完全社会主义的集体农民公有制的更高级的农业生产合作社（也就是集体农庄）。
    社会主义和资本主义两种相反的生产关系在一个国家内互不干扰地平行发展是不可能的。不是走到社会主义社会，就要走到资本主义社会，而后者是我国人民所不许可的。走社会主义的路，是我国历史发展的必然趋势。以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央委员会指出，在中国的具体条件下，经过国家资本主义的各种形式来改造资本主义工商业，即第一步把资本主义工商业逐渐转变为国家资本主义企业，第二步把国家资本主义企业逐渐转变为社会主义企业，不但是必要的，而且是可能的。过去五年的实践已经证明，目前我国对于资本主义工商业所采取的利用、限制和改造的政策，是确实可行的政策，这个政策也正是列宁所提出的关于国家资本主义的政策在中国条件下的具体运用。
    实行文化革命也是我们党在过渡时期的重要事业之一。毛泽东同志在党的七次代表大会的报告中曾痛切地指出，民族压迫和封建压迫所给予中国人民的灾难中，包括着民族文化的灾难。他把从百分之八十的人口中扫除文盲，列为新中国的一项重要工作，并特别讲到农民，认为是现阶段中国文化运动的主要对象。对于一切奴化的、封建主义和法西斯主义的文化和教育，要采取适当的坚决的步骤加以扫除。要建立自己的民族的、科学的、人民大众的新文化和新教育。把苏联所创造的新文化，作为我们建设人民文化的范例。当中国的民主革命在全国范围内取得胜利、中国革命即将转入社会主义革命阶段的时候，毛泽东同志在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议上的开幕词中又指出：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。中国人被人认为不文明的时代已经过去了，我们将以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界。”在中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的开幕词中，毛泽东同志又说：“……准备在几个五年计划之内，将我们现在这样一个经济上文化上落后的国家，建设成为一个工业化的具有高度现代文化程度的伟大的国家。”
    自从中华人民共和国成立以来，我们的党和国家在文化革命事业方面，采取了许多重要措施，首先，我国学校教育事业有了巨大发展，各级学校学生中的工农子女成份逐年增加，为了培养工农出身的新知识分子，创办了工农速成中学，在广大知识分子中进行了思想改造运动，中小学教育中注意了劳动教育。我国的科学事业和文化艺术事业，在过去几年内都有了不小的发展和重要的贡献。扫除文盲的工作已经着手进行。这种文化革命事业同时也根据具体情况在少数民族地区推行。近几年中，经
  过学校和其他方法培养出来的少数民族干部已有十余万人。更值得指出的是我们党最近所领导开展的广泛宣传辩证唯物主义、批判资产阶级唯心主义的运动。现在全国党的、军队的、文教系统的、经济系统的、以及其他部门和各群众团体的有阅读能力的干部和知识分子，大约有五百万人，这一宣传唯物主义运动，须要在较长时期中做到在他们中的绝大部分（例如三百万人）都能够了解唯物主义与唯心主义的区别，懂得辩证唯物主义的基本内容，并且通过他们，用唯物主义思想教育文化水平低的广大人民群众。宣传马克思列宁主义的哲学唯物主义思想，是我们党的思想教育的主要内容。没有马克思列宁主义的哲学唯物主义思想的广泛的宣传教育做基础，我们就不能在我们的国土上培植出社会主义的文化来，而如果没有社会主义的文化，我们也就不能建立起一个完全的社会主义国家。马克思列宁主义的哲学唯物主义思想教育的深入，对于我们的社会主义事业的建设，将要起着不可估量的巨大作用。
    正如毛泽东同志所指示的，中国现在是处在新的历史时期。在一个拥有六万万人口的、经济上文化上都很落后的国家中，进行社会主义革命，实现党在过渡时期的总路线，决不是轻而易举的事，而且决不会不遇到许多困难的。但是，如果把我国的过渡时期的条件同苏联的过渡时期的条件比较一下，我们建成社会主义的信心便百倍地提高了。苏联在开始建设社会主义的时候，是世界上唯一的一个社会主义国家，从国家的援助上说，它不但是孤立无援的，而且是处在帝国主义国家的包围中，帝国主义国家时时刻刻想要扑灭它。它曾经经受过许许多多令人难以想像的困难。可是任何巨大的困难，在为马克思列宁主义所武装起来的布尔什维克党面前，没有克服不了的。在列宁和他的继承者斯大林领导下的苏联共产党，终于扫除了一切困难，建成了社会主义社会。我们今天开始建设社会主义的时候，首先就不是孤立地来建设社会主义，而是在已经有了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营这样一个优越条件下来建设社会主义。我们有列宁关于过渡时期的学说为指针，有苏联建成社会主义社会的无限丰富的实际经验作借镜，并且有苏联对我们经济上技术上的无私援助，有各人民民主国家同我们的亲密合作，全世界人民的觉悟程度已经比第二次世界大战以前大大提高。再加上我们自己的许多优越条件，即我们有以毛泽东同志为首的团结一致的中国共产党的英明领导，我们有几万万勤劳勇敢不怕任何困难的英雄的人民愿意为实现社会主义而奋斗，我们有无限丰富的天然资源可以开采利用，如此等等，我们建成社会主义的条件是充分具备的。国际帝国主义和国内反动分子虽然还在千方百计地企图破坏和阻碍我国的社会主义建设，我国人民必须对他们提高警惕，但是，无论如何，他们是不能阻止我国人民建成社会主义社会的。因此，正如毛泽东同志在中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的开幕词中所说的，“我们有充分的信心，克服一切艰难困苦，将我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义共和国。”
