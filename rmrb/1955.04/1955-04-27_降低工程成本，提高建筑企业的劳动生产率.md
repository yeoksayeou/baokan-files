    Reducing Engineering Costs, Increasing Labor Productivity of Construction Enterprises
    In the past two years, despite our weak foundation and lack of experience, we have completed many important projects, and the construction progress and quality have basically met the requirements of the state. However, at the same time, many construction enterprises have serious waste, and the completion of construction plans is often achieved at the cost of excessive manpower, financial resources, and materials. This shortcoming is concentrated in the high engineering costs of enterprises, low labor productivity, and frequent failure to fully complete basic construction plans.
    This phenomenon cannot continue. Because the national Five-Year Plan for basic construction and investment plan has been carefully balanced and determined, project items cannot be reduced, and investments cannot be increased. If we cannot overcome this waste, we may have to exceed the state's basic construction investment plan. As we know, during the execution of the Five-Year Plan, some unforeseen circumstances may occur, such as increased expenditures in some areas, decreased revenues in some areas, and the possibility of major disasters or other sudden events. These all require the state to have sufficient reserves to cope with. Therefore, to ensure the successful realization of the Five-Year Plan, we should not only guarantee the completion of the state-allocated plan with the pre-determined funds, but also strive to economize to replenish the state's financial reserves. Especially in the next three years, basic construction investment accounts for more than two-thirds of the total basic construction investment during the entire five years. If the work is not done well, the amount of waste will be significant; and if we strive to economize, the potential that can be tapped is immeasurable. Therefore, this year, in addition to continuing to strive to complete construction on schedule as required by the state and strictly guaranteeing project quality, all construction enterprises must pay special attention to economic issues. In this year's construction, all construction enterprises must unconditionally complete and strive to over fulfill the targets for reducing costs and increasing labor productivity while completing the engineering progress and projects.
    The experience of the past two years has proven that the reasons for high construction costs and low labor productivity are primarily due to neglecting construction preparation work. Before starting a project, preparation work must be done well, the total construction progress must be determined, the overall construction organization design and the overall site construction plan must be prepared, and a certain reserve of drawings must be maintained. This is an objective law that must be followed in basic construction. However, some comrades do not recognize or do not pay attention to this law, relying solely on subjective enthusiasm, seeking speed and haste, and often starting construction hastily when construction conditions are insufficient. As a result, the moment the project starts, a major mistake has already been made, and no matter how one tries to remedy it, it is difficult to reverse the passive situation, and chaos and waste cannot be fundamentally eliminated. The First Automobile Works is an example. It ensured the quality of the factory's construction and the state's progress; however, this project did not have a comprehensive arrangement or good preparation before construction began. After construction began, there were frequent work stoppages and idleness. A total of 740,000 workdays were wasted over two years, wasting 450,000 yuan in wage funds. Because materials were blindly prepared before the design was completed, materials worth more than 10 million yuan were stockpiled by the end of 1954. Because permanent engineering was not utilized in advance, the arrangement and utilization of the railway special line were not well done, wasting about 3 million yuan. The mistakes of the First Automobile Works were made in the early stages of large factory construction in our country and were exposed a year ago, but there are still some units, such as a construction site in Luoyang, that have not learned from the First Automobile Works' experience. Its level of chaos and waste is far above that of the First Automobile Works. This is intolerable. They should immediately take measures to correct this mistake. We must never allow completing plans by violating construction procedures again. All competent departments and local Party committees, all construction enterprises and construction units must supervise and ensure that plans are completed according to construction procedures.
    Another reason for high engineering costs and low labor productivity is the severely unbalanced construction progress. In the past two years, construction enterprises generally only completed an average of about a quarter of the annual plan in the first half of the year, with the remaining 70% to 80% or more of the workload being squeezed into the second half of the year. More severely, some completed less than 10% of the workload in the first half of the year. This results in a large amount of idleness in the first half of the year, and a large number of temporary workers have to be added in the second half of the year to rush the work. In addition to the imbalance in quarterly plans, the progress in each month is also very uneven, with many enterprises often completing more than twice the amount of work in the last ten days of the month compared to the first ten days. The reasons for the uneven construction, in addition to the late determination of plans and the failure of drawings and equipment to arrive on time, are mainly poor planning and organization work and the inability to construct in winter and rainy seasons. Therefore, to strive for balanced construction, the first important measure for construction enterprises is to strengthen planning management. The Party organizations of enterprises must educate Party members and the masses to wage a struggle against all departmentalism and non-compliance with planning. Trade unions should organize all employees to launch labor competitions around work plans. In this way, at least the situation of uneven monthly plans can be fundamentally improved. The second measure is to promote winter and rainy season construction, striving for more working days in a year. To promote this work, all departments should formulate annual working day targets for their affiliated enterprises based on the conditions of different regions and different projects, and implement them.
    Another important aspect of reducing engineering costs and increasing labor productivity is to improve the technical level of construction and improve the management system for technical work. This is primarily because poor project quality is still a major shortcoming in current construction. Enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry had a total of more than 7,600 quality accidents in the last three quarters of last year, of which rework accounted for 74.4%, resulting in significant waste in materials and labor. Secondly, the fundamental measures to improve labor productivity in the construction industry—factory-based and mechanized construction—have not yet been mastered by us. Under the current specific conditions in our country, this measure cannot be widely and fully implemented; however, as a direction for development, it is absolutely necessary to advance gradually and in a planned way. The utilization rate of mechanized construction that already exists in our country is very low, generally only reaching about 30%. Many machines are often left idle, and when they are started, their efficiency is also very low, and the phenomenon of damage is very serious. The equipment utilization of affiliated production enterprises is also not good. Some enterprises can only utilize 20% to 30% of their equipment capacity, and some products are even more expensive than those made by hand. These situations still require us to work hard to change.
    In recent years, Soviet experts have taught us many new technologies with great economic value, and there are also many creations among the masses, but they have not been well promoted. This is very inappropriate. In a new factory in Heilongjiang Province, two workshops were simultaneously carrying out the construction of concrete foundations last winter. One workshop adopted the Soviet advanced comprehensive heating method and mobile greenhouses based on the experts' suggestions, while the other workshop insisted on using the old method. As a result, the additional winter construction costs for the two workshops differed by more than four times. The single-bucket excavator driven by the Jia Jiqing team of Anshan Iron and Steel excavated more than 100,000 cubic meters of soil last year. However, the annual output of the same machinery in other enterprises of the Ministry of Heavy Industry is less than half of theirs, and some are only 6% of theirs. If we promote the experience of the Jia Jiqing team well, we can greatly increase the degree of mechanization of earth excavation projects nationwide using the existing equipment. As long as we pay practical attention to improving the technical level of construction and strengthening the management system of technical work, it will bring us great economic value. All employees of construction enterprises should launch a mass movement to learn technology and improve technical levels, especially a movement to learn advanced Soviet technology. At the same time, various technical management systems should be established and improved, and leadership over technical work should be strengthened.
    Another reason for high engineering costs is the widespread and serious waste in the supply and management of materials. Due to late delivery of drawings, urgent tasks, and many changes, many units have not actively overcome these difficulties, but instead adopted the attitude of "cutting wide and using narrow" and "preparing for all possibilities," blindly stockpiling large quantities, resulting in a large amount of material backlog. Last year, the Ministry of Heavy Industry alone had a backlog of materials worth 50 million yuan. Due to the lack of strict management systems in transportation, storage, and usage, and the lack of a frugal mindset among staff, the phenomena of material damage, loss, excessive consumption, using large materials for small purposes, and using superior materials for inferior purposes exist to varying degrees in almost all construction enterprises. Given that material costs account for 60% to 70% of engineering costs, we must pay special attention to these shortcomings in material work, strengthen the planning of material procurement, organize reasonable transportation, establish a scientific storage system and receipt, distribution, requisition, and return systems, launch a mass movement to save materials, and gradually reduce material consumption quotas. If we seriously take these measures, we will quickly achieve significant results in reducing costs.
    By grasping the four main links of strengthening preparation work, striving for balanced construction, improving technical levels, and improving material work, and supplementing them with measures such as promoting piece-rate wages and improving labor organization, the labor productivity of construction enterprises will be greatly improved and costs will be significantly reduced.

### 降低工程成本，提高建筑企业的劳动生产率

    降低工程成本，提高建筑企业的劳动生产率
    两年来，我们在基础薄弱、经验缺乏的情况下，建成了很多重要的工程，建筑进度和质量都基本上达到了国家的要求。但是，与此同时，有很多建筑企业存在着比较严重的浪费现象，建设计划的完成，常常是耗费了过多的人力、财力和物力换取得来的。这个缺点集中表现为企业的工程成本很高，劳动生产率很低，基本建设计划经常不能全面地完成。
    这种现象不能再继续下去了。因为国家五年基本建设计划和投资计划，经过周密的平衡计算，已经确定下来，工程项目不能减少，投资不能增加。如果我们不能克服这些浪费，就有可能要突破国家的基本建设投资计划。而我们知道，在五年计划的执行过程中，完全可能发生一些不可预知的情况，例如某些方面的支出可能增多，某些方面的收入可能减少，还可能遇到大灾荒及其他突然事变。这些都需要国家手中有充足的后备才能应付。因此，为了保证五年计划的完满实现，我们就不仅应该保证用预定的款项来完成国家所分配的计划，而且必须努力节约，来充实国家的资金储备。特别是今后三年，基本建设投资约占整个五年基本建设投资总数的三分之二以上，工作做得不好，浪费的数目将会很大；而如果我们努力节约，可以挖掘出来的潜力也是无法估量的。所以，今年各个建筑企业除了要毫不松懈地继续争取按国家所规定的建设进度如期完成、严格保证工程质量之外，必须特殊地注意经济问题。各个建筑企业在今年施工中，在完成工程进度和工程项目的同时，必须无条件地完成和力争超额完成降低成本和提高劳动生产率的指标。
    两年来的经验证明，建筑成本高和劳动生产率低的原因，首先是由于忽视施工准备工作造成的。一个工程在开工之前必须做好准备工作，必须确定施工总进度，编好施工组织总设计和现场施工总平面图，并保有一定的图纸储备，这是基本建设施工必须遵守的客观规律。但是有些同志不认识或是不重视这个规律，单凭主观热情，求急求快，往往施工条件不足就仓促开工。结果工程刚刚开始，大错就已铸成，无论怎样设法补救，被动的局面都很难扭转，混乱和浪费已无法从根本上消除。第一汽车制造厂就是一个例子。它是保证了工厂建筑的质量和国家进度的；但这个工程在开工前没有作通盘安排，没有作好准备。开工后，经常停工窝工，两年中共窝工七十四万个工日，浪费了工资基金四十五万元。因为设计没有出来就盲目准备材料，到一九五四年底积压了价值一千余万元的器材。因为没有提前利用永久性工程，铁路专用线布置和利用得不好，浪费了三百万元左右。第一汽车制造厂的错误是在我国大工厂建筑的初期所犯的而且在一年前已经暴露了，但现在还有一些单位，比如洛阳某工地，还没有接受第一汽车制造厂的教训，它的混乱和浪费程度远在第一汽车厂之上。这是不能容忍的。它们应立即采取措施纠正这一错误。我们决不应该允许再用违反建设程序的办法来完成计划。各个主管部门和地方党委、各个建筑企业和建设单位都要监督和保证按照建设程序来完成计划。
    工程成本高和劳动生产率低的另一个原因是施工进度严重地不均衡。在过去两年中，建筑企业一般的在上半年平均只能完成全年计划的四分之一上下，其余百分之七十到八十以上的工作量都要挤在下半年来完成。严重的更有上半年完成的工作量还不到百分之十的。这就使得上半年大量窝工，下半年又要大量增加临时工人突击赶工。除了季度计划不均衡外，每月的进度也是很不均衡的，有很多企业下旬的工作量常常超过上旬一倍。施工不均衡的原因，除了计划确定得晚，图纸和设备不能按时到达外，就建筑企业来说，主要是计划、组织工作不好和冬季、雨季不能施工。因此，建筑企业要争取均衡施工，第一个重要措施是必须加强计划管理，企业的党组织要教育党员和群众对一切本位主义和不服从计划的思想行为展开斗争，工会要组织全体职工围绕着作业计划展开劳动竞赛。这样，至少月计划不均衡的状况可以得到根本改善。第二个措施便是推行冬季和雨季施工，争取在一年中有更多的工作日。为了推动这个工作，各个部门应该根据不同地区不同工程的情况，给所属企业规定全年工作日的指标，贯彻执行。
    降低工程成本，提高劳动生产率的再一个重要方面是提高施工的技术水平，健全技术工作的管理制度。这首先是因为工程质量不好仍然是目前施工中的一个重大缺点。重工业部所属企业在去年后三个季度中一共发生了七千六百多次质量事故，其中返工的占百分之七十四点四，在材料上、劳动上都造成了很大的浪费。其次，提高建筑业劳动生产率的根本措施——工厂化和机械化施工，也还没有为我们所掌握。这一措施在我国目前的具体条件下，还不能广泛地全面地铺开；但作为一个发展的方向，有计划地逐步地前进，则是完全必需的。目前我国已有的机械化施工，其利用率是很低的，一般只达到百分之三十左右，有很多机械经常搁置不用，开动的时候效率也很低，而且损坏的现象很严重。附属生产企业的设备利用情况也不好，有些企业的设备能力只能发挥到百分之二三十，有的产品甚至比手工制造的还贵。这些情况还需要我们努力加以改变。
    几年来苏联专家教给了我们很多有巨大经济价值的新技术，群众中也有不少创造，都没有很好地推广。这是很不应该的。黑龙江省有一个新建工厂，去年冬天有两个车间同时进行混凝土基础的施工。一个车间根据专家建议，采用了苏联先进的综合加热法和活动暖棚，另一个车间仍坚持使用旧方法，结果两个车间所用的冬季施工附加费用相差四倍多。鞍钢贾吉庆小组驾驶的单斗挖土机，去年挖了十万多立方公尺的土。而重工业部其他企业同样的机械，年产量有的不及他们的一半，有的只及他们的百分之六。如果很好地推广贾吉庆小组的经验，使用现有的设备，就可以使全国挖土工程机械化的程度大大提高。只要我们切实注意提高施工的技术水平和加强技术工作的管理制度，它就会给我们带来巨大的经济价值。所有的建筑企业的职工，应该展开一个学习技术、提高技术水平的群众运动，特别是学习苏联先进技术的运动。同时应该建立和健全各种技术管理制度，加强对技术工作的领导。
    造成工程成本高还有一个原因，那就是材料的供应和管理工作上存在着普遍而严重的浪费现象。由于图纸交得迟，任务急，变化多，许多单位又没有积极地克服这些困难，反而采取“宽打窄用”、“有备无患”的态度，盲目地大量储备，结果就造成了材料的大量积压。去年仅重工业部一个部积压的材料即价值五千万元。由于在运输、保管、使用等环节上缺乏严格的管理制度和工作人员缺乏节约思想，所以材料损坏丢失、超额消耗、大材小用，优材劣用的现象，几乎在绝大多数的建筑企业中都或多或少地存在着。鉴于材料费在工程成本中要占到百分之六七十，所以我们对材料工作中的这些缺点必须特别地注意，必须加强材料采购的计划性，组织合理的运输，建立科学的保管制度和收、发、领、退等制度，发动群众展开节约材料的运动，逐步降低材料的消耗定额。如果我们认真地采取这些措施，在降低成本上将会迅速地取得显著的效果。
    抓住了加强准备工作、争取均衡施工、提高技术水平、改善材料工作这四个主要环节，再辅之以推行计件工资、改进劳动组织等等措施，建筑企业的劳动生产率就会大大提高，成本就会显著地降低。
