    At a scientific seminar held at the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology on April 8, people discussed a new experiment in "oxygen steelmaking in converters" conducted by teachers of the steelmaking teaching and research group at the Tangshan Steel Plant.
    The room where the report was held was hung with various experimental charts and photographs. Dong Liren, Zhang Xu'e, and Feng Hongfang, graduate students who participated in the experiment, presented reports on the experimental process and results of "oxygen steelmaking in converters" at the Tangshan Steel Plant. They analyzed in detail the achievements and shortcomings of this experiment. "Oxygen steelmaking in converters" was a first for China. The experiment was led by Soviet expert Savelyev from the Institute, and Professor Shi Xinpu also participated. The experiment proved that "oxygen steelmaking in converters" could smelt rimming steel and various steel grades that need to be smelted at high temperatures. The time for each furnace of steelmaking was also shortened by 69.5 percent compared to the original, the output was increased by one to two times, and the product performance was also very good.
    Scientists and engineers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Black Metalurgical Design Institute, the State Planning Commission, and other units who participated in the discussion congratulated the success of this new experiment and thanked the Soviet experts for their help. Ye Zhubei, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: The method of combining teaching and production at the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology is an important measure for training technical experts with a high level of scientific expertise.

    北京钢铁工业学院讨论一种新的炼钢技术
    四月八日，在北京钢铁工业学院举行的科学专题报告会上，人们讨论了炼钢教研组的教师在唐山钢厂所进行的“转炉用氧炼钢”的新实验。
    举行报告会的室内挂着各种实验图表和照片。参加这次实验的研究生董履仁、张绪鄂、冯鸿芳分别就唐山钢厂“转炉用氧炼钢”的实验过程和成效提出了报告。他们详细地分析了这次实验中所获得的成绩和缺点。“转炉用氧炼钢”在我国还是第一次。这次实验由学院中的苏联专家萨维利也夫领导，教授石心圃也参加了这次实验。实验证明：“转炉用氧炼钢”可以冶炼沸腾钢，能炼出需要在高温下才能炼出的各种钢种，每炉炼钢的时间还比原来缩短了百分之六十九点五，产量提高一倍到二倍，产品性能也很好。
    参加讨论的中国科学院、重工业部、黑色冶金设计院、国家计划委员会等单位的科学家和工程师们，都祝贺这次新实验的成功，并感谢苏联专家的帮助。中国科学院研究员叶渚沛说：北京钢铁工业学院这种教学和生产相结合的方法，是培养具有高度科学水平的技术专家的重要措施。（新华社）
