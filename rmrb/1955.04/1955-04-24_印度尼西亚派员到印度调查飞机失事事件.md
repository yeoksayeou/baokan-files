Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 21st: The Indonesian five-member committee responsible for the preliminary investigation into the sabotage and crash of the Indian aircraft "Kashmir Princess" arrived in Bombay on April 17th, where they spoke with the surviving co-pilot Dixit and ground mechanic Kanik from the plane. The committee arrived in Calcutta on April 20th, where they recorded the testimony of the plane's third survivor, navigator Pathak.

Imawang, the chairman of the investigation committee, told reporters in Calcutta that after talking with the survivors, the committee's most important task is to investigate the wreckage of the crashed plane, which is currently being salvaged.

Imawang said in Bombay that the committee will submit a report to the Indonesian government within two weeks, after which a new committee may be appointed to conduct a public investigation into the cause of the crash. He also said that since most of the important witnesses are in India, the public investigation will be conducted in India.

    印度尼西亚派员到印度调查飞机失事事件
    新华社新德里二十一日电　负责对印度飞机“克什米尔公主号”被破坏失事事件进行初步调查的印度尼西亚五人委员会，在四月十七日到达孟买，在那里同这架飞机上生还的副驾驶员狄克西特和地勤机械师卡尼克进行了谈话。委员会在四月二十日到达了加尔各答，在那里记录了飞机上第三个生还者领航员帕塔克的证词。
    调查委员会主席伊马汪在加尔各答告诉新闻记者说，在同生还者谈话以后，委员会最重要的工作就是对正在打捞中的失事飞机的残骸进行调查。
    伊马汪在孟买时说委员会将在两星期内向印度尼西亚政府提出报告，在这以后，可能会指定一个新的委员会对这次失事事件的原因进行公开调查。他又说，由于大部分重要证人都在印度，所以公开调查将在印度进行。
