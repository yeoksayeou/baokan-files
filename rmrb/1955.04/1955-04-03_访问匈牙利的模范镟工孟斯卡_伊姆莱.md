    Visiting Imre Menszka, Hungarian Model Lathe Operator
    Ai Wu

    Leaving the city of Budapest and crossing a short iron bridge, you enter Csepel Island in the Danube River. Here stands one of Hungary's largest heavy industrial factories—the Rákosi Factory. On a dyke to the right of the highway runs an electric train, exclusively for the use of the island's workers commuting to and from work. A month ago, when we visited the Rákosi Factory, we saw fields stretching endlessly to the left of the highway, densely planted with green cabbages. Now, they were covered with a thick layer of snow. Black clouds of smoke drifted in the sky ahead on the highway. Countless chimneys became increasingly distinct. Soon, the giant school where workers studied at night and the stadium where football matches were played lit up with brilliant lights in the vast twilight. The car drove into this famous industrial city, passed through the street named after the poet Endre Ady, and stopped in front of a small Western-style house. A row of wooden fences blocked the street. The house was surrounded by snow-covered open spaces. We got out of the car, stepped through the snow, and went to knock on the wooden gate. A man of medium build, wearing a dark blue sweater, ran out and happily led us in. This was Imre Menszka, a lathe operator at the Rákosi Factory and a recipient of the Hungarian Kossuth Prize. I knew he was a famous labor model throughout Hungary when I visited the factory a month ago, and I had also seen his portrait in the machine shop. But this was the first time I had met him in person. Inside, there was a well-furnished living room. Since there was no time to light the stove, he invited us to sit in his amateur study. A shelf with a slanting wooden board and various drawing instruments stood prominently in the corner of the room by the window. On the other side, there was a desk with a lamp and a radio. The floor was covered with a rug. The walls were painted light yellow, with many brown leaves drawn on them. It felt like entering the studio of a scientist or a writer. He greeted us very amiably. His appearance was also similar to ours, with black hair, a thin face with traces of a beard, and yellowish-blue eyes, and he looked very energetic. You couldn't tell that he had just finished work. His wife and daughter came in from the next room, looking surprised and happy, and sat beside us, listening to our conversation, because it was the first time that Chinese people had visited their home. Imre Menszka first asked with concern:
    "Our factory manufactures a lot of machines for China. If there is anything that is not easy to use, please tell me, and we can improve it immediately."
    The Rákosi Factory, from steelmaking to manufacturing various machines and machine tools, is large in scale and well-equipped. Many finished products are supplied to the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, and are also exported to countries as far away as Argentina in Latin America. China had ordered dozens of machine tools, which had already been shipped. We knew this from our previous two visits to the factory. Now, hearing his concerned inquiry, we thanked him and told him that the Hungarian machines were very good. He raised his thick eyebrows and said happily:
    "It's really great to hear our Chinese comrades say they are good. We must make the machines even better. The Chinese people are building a socialist society, and we Hungarian workers must also contribute." As he said this, he clenched his right hand in front of his chest, which had a zipper and buttons, and moved it slightly. A firm look appeared on his thin face. Then he said: "Even the best machines need to be constantly improved to increase efficiency. I have made more than twenty improvements to the lathe I use since liberation. Even the engineer who originally designed and manufactured this lathe can't figure out its structure now."
    Imre Menszka has made many remarkable achievements in continuously improving machines. First of all, the working speed of the machines has increased, the number of processes has decreased, and the time spent has also decreased. For example, making an important part on the machine used to take an hour, but now it only takes ten minutes. In other words, what used to take a day's work can now be completed in one hour and twenty minutes. He spoke of his achievements without any arrogance, and said modestly:
    "There are hundreds of thousands of people like me throughout Hungary. They are all working hard to improve their lathes, and some are doing even better than me. I am just the first to receive a national prize."
    He started working at the age of thirteen. He is forty years old this year. He is very familiar with the machines in the workshop. I asked him if he had made any improvements before Hungary was liberated.
    "No," he said a little excitedly, "at that time, the factory belonged to the boss. Who would make improvements for him! They exploited us workers so badly. I even lived in days when we used two bricks to prop up a pot for cooking. After liberation, I felt that the workers were in charge, and the machines belonged to the workers themselves. We should cherish them, value them, and constantly improve them."
      "Did you encounter any difficulties in improving the machines?"
    Hearing me ask this, he said without hesitation:
    "Yes, some workers who were slow to wake up even opposed it. In the early days of liberation, when Hungary still had inflation, some people advised me, why bother working so hard, the money you get is not worth anything. I said, are we improving machines for money? If you think that way, you are wrong. We are doing it to build a socialist society more quickly. I also told him that we will be better off. You see, wasn't I right?"
    Imre Menszka lit a cigarette, took a puff, and said with a smile:
    "I didn't realize that I should improve machines all at once either. At first, I saw in the newspapers that many Soviet workers had improved machines. I thought, am I not a worker too? If Soviet workers can do it, why can't Hungarian workers do it? I made up my mind to improve machines. Later, the Soviet lathe operator Pavel Bykov came to the factory to teach us the fast-working method for lathes, and I quickly learned it. I also went to other factories to promote work experience and taught many people. This further increased my confidence. I expressed my determination to improve machines on the wall newspaper and submitted the improvement plan to the higher authorities. My determination received the attention and support of the state, which gave me great encouragement. Because of my achievements, I received the Kossuth Prize. The state also wanted me to join the delegation to the Soviet Union to congratulate Comrade Stalin on his seventieth birthday, so that I could see the great teacher of the world's workers, Stalin, in the Kremlin, and also see your Chinese people's great leader Mao Zedong. This kind of happiness was something I never dreamed of. I only knew that our workers' lives would get better and better."
    He continued: "Now, many people recognize the benefits of improving machines and increasing work efficiency. They are working hard to improve machines, and they are improving them even better than I am. At the same time, I have also come to understand that one person doing a good job is not socialism. It is only when everyone does a good job that it is socialism." Then he pointed to his daughter and said, "People like my daughter will all become Stakhanovite workers in the future. Isn't that wonderful!"
    His daughter is eleven years old and a fifth-grade student. She has two braids hanging from her shoulders to the front. She strokes them with her hand while listening attentively to our conversation. She is the only child in the family, and her father regards her as the apple of his eye. In the corner of the room, there is a brand-new baby carriage. Sitting on it is a large doll, which her father obviously bought especially for her to play with.
    I glanced at the various drawing instruments on the wooden shelf and asked him:
    "Do you go to night school to study?"
    "No, I study at home." He glanced at the wooden shelf and continued, "I hire an engineer to teach me and ask him to give me questions to do. Sometimes, I study for five hours a day, which is more than I would study in school." Then he smiled softly and said, "I am most afraid of leaving the lathe. If I don't work on the lathe for a day, I feel very uncomfortable. I like working on the lathe, just like an artist likes doing his sculptures. Our Minister of Industry asked me: 'Comrade Imre Menszka, would you like to do factory management work?' I said: 'Minister, I am willing to do whatever work you want me to do. I will follow your assignment. If you still want me to consider it, I still want to continue improving machines. I am confident in this work, and I will definitely be able to achieve results. If you let me work on the lathe first and then do other work, I am also willing.' I am very happy that I was not asked to leave the lathe." Then he asked me, "Do you have good lathe operators in China? Have you made any important improvements to the lathe?"
    I said that I didn't know what machines the Chinese lathe operators had improved. I lacked knowledge in this area. But I knew about fitters and planers, and they had made significant improvements to the machines. I told him about the process of fitter Zhang Mingshan creating the anti-encirclement disk. When I encountered some industrial terms that were difficult to translate, I drew diagrams and used two pens as pliers to show him how to clamp steel bars. After he understood, he was very excited and said twice:
    "I must tell the comrades in our factory about this creation tomorrow." After a pause, he said happily, "I am so happy that China has such workers."
    I also said happily:
    "I am also happy that Hungary has workers like you who love the country, love their work, love to learn, and work hard to improve machines. I must tell the Chinese people about your deeds."
    Then I asked him:
    "In addition to studying mathematics and mechanics, do you read other books?"
    He looked at me, smiled, and said:
    "I also like to read the poems of Petőfi."
    When he walked us out of the house, he also used a flashlight to shine on the snow-covered open space behind the house and said:
    "I also like to grow flowers. If you come here in the spring, you will be happy to see our small garden."

    访问匈牙利的模范镟工孟斯卡·伊姆莱
    艾芜
    出了布达佩斯的市区，经过一条不大长的铁桥，就进入了多瑙河中的契贝尔岛。这里建立着匈牙利最大的重工业工厂之一——拉科西工厂。在公路右边的一道堤上，驰走着电气火车，这是专供岛上工人上下班使用的。公路左边一望无际的田野上，我们一个月以前，去参观拉科西工厂时，还看见青色的包白菜，密密地长着。现在却已铺上了厚厚的一层雪了。公路前面的天空里浮动着黑色的烟云。无数的烟囱，越来越鲜明地显现出来。不久，工人在晚上读书的巨大学校和比赛足球的运动场，都在苍茫的暮色中亮起了辉煌的灯火。汽车驶进这个著名的工业城，经过以诗人安得烈·阿蒂命名的街道，就停在一座小洋房前面。临街还拦着一列木栅栏，房子的前后左右，有着积雪的空地。我们走下汽车，踏着雪前去扣木栅栏做的门。一个中等身材的汉子，穿着深蓝色的毛线衣跑出来，高兴地把我们领了进去。他就是拉科西工厂的镟工孟斯卡·伊姆莱，匈牙利柯苏特奖金的获得者。一个月前我去工厂参观时就已知道他是全匈牙利著名的劳动模范，还看见机械车间里挂着他的像片。但同他本人会见这还是第一次。屋里有间陈设得很好的客厅，因为来不及生炉子，他便请我们到他的业余研究室去坐。一座斜放着木板的架子和各种绘图仪器，很显明地立在靠窗的屋角上。另一边桌上放着台灯、收音机。地上铺着地毡。墙壁抹着淡黄色，画着许多棕色的花叶。使人感到这像是进了一个科学家或是作家的工作室一样。他接待我们，非常和蔼。他样子也同我们东方人接近，长着一头黑发，瘦削的脸，有着串脸胡的痕迹，眼仁黄色，略带一点淡蓝，精神非常饱满，看不出他才下班没多久。他的夫人和女儿，都从邻室走进来了，现出惊奇和欢喜的脸色，坐在我们的侧边，听我们谈话。因为中国人到他们家来这还是第一次哩。孟斯卡·伊姆莱首先关切地问：
    “我们厂里给中国制造不少机器，假如有什么地方不好使用，请告诉我，我们可以改进，立刻就改进。”
    拉科西工厂从炼钢一直到制造各种机器和各种工作母机，都是规模宏大、设备齐全的。许多成品供应给苏联和人民民主国家，并且还向远到拉丁美洲的阿根廷等国家输出。中国订购的工作母机，已运走了好几十部。这是我们前两次参观工厂的时候，就已知道了的。现在听见他那种关心的询问，就向他致谢，并告诉他说匈牙利的机器很好。他浓眉一扬，很高兴地说：
    “中国同志说好，真是高兴，我们定要把机器作的更好。中国人民建设社会主义社会，我们匈牙利工人也一定要出把力。”他这样说的时候，右手还在有着拉链钮扣的胸前握成拳头动了一下。瘦削的脸上，现出刚毅的神情。接着又说：“就是再好的机器，也要不断改进，提高工作效率，我自己使用的一架车床，解放后就已作了二十多次的改进，就连原先设计制造这架车床的工程师，现在也弄不清它的构造了。”
    孟斯卡·伊姆莱不断地改进机器，有着很多显著的成绩。首先是机器的工作速度增加，工序减少，花费的时间也减少了。像做机器上的一个重要零件，先前需要一个钟头、现在只需十分钟。也就是说，现在一点二十分钟就能够作完原先一天的工作。他讲到他的成绩并无骄矜之色，还谦虚地说：
    “像我这样子的全匈牙利就有成千上万个。他们都在努力工作，改进他们的车床，有的比我还作得好，我不过是首先得到国家奖金的人。”
    他十三岁就开始作工。今年已四十岁了。对于车间的机器他非常熟悉。我问他，在匈牙利解放以前有什么改进没有。
    “没有”，他有点激动地说：“那时工厂是老板的，谁替他改进！他们剥削得我们工人好苦，两块砖头架起锅子煮饭的日子，我都有过哩。解放后，觉得工人当家作主了，机器是属于工人自己的，就应该爱护它，宝贵它，还要常常改进它。”
      “你改进机器遇到什么困难没有？”
    听见我这么问他，他毫不迟疑地说：
    “有的，有些觉悟慢的工人还反对过哩。解放初期，匈牙利还有通货膨胀的时候，还有人劝告我，你何苦这样卖力，得的钱也不值钱。我说，我们改进机器，是为的钱吗？那你就想错了，我们是为了更迅速地建设社会主义社会。我又告诉他我们会好的。你看，我不是说对了吗？
    孟斯卡·伊姆莱点了根烟，吸了一会，微笑着说：
    “我也不是一下子就觉悟到要改进机器的。起先我是在报上看见许多苏联的工人改进了机器。我就想，我不也是一个工人吗？苏联工人做得到，我匈牙利工人为什么不可以做到。我打定主意，要改进机器。后来苏联的镟工巴维尔·贝可夫到工厂来教我们镟床快速工作法，我很快就学会了。我还到别个工厂去推广工作经验，教会不少人。这就更增加了我的信心。我就在墙报上表示我要改进机器的决心，还把改进的计划提交上级。我的决心得到了国家的重视和支持，这给了我很大的鼓励。由于我的成绩，我获得了柯苏特奖金。国家还要我参加到苏联去祝贺斯大林同志七十寿辰的代表团，使我能在克里姆林宫看到世界工人的伟大导师斯大林，又能够看到你们中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东。这种幸福，是我做梦也没有想到的，我只知道我们工人的生活会越来越好。”
    他接着说：“现在好多人都认识改进机器、提高工作效率的好处。他们努力改进机器，比我都要改进得好。同时我也更加了解到，一个人做好工作，不算社会主义，要大家都做好工作，才算社会主义。”接着他还指着他的女儿说：“像我女儿这一代人，将来都要成为斯塔哈诺夫工作者，这真是多好啊！”
    他的女儿十一岁，是个五年级的小学生。两条辫子从肩上拖到前面来，她用手抚弄着，一面又注意地听我们讲话。她是这个家庭的唯一的孩子，父亲把她看成掌上的明珠。在屋角上有一部崭新的婴孩车子。上面坐着一个很大的洋娃娃，显然那是父亲特意买来给她玩的。
    我望了一下木板架上的各种绘图仪器，就问他道：
    “你到夜校去学习吗？”
    “没有，我就在家里学习。”他望了一下木架子，继续说：“请一个工程师教我，要他出题目给我做。有时候，我一天要学习五个钟头，比在学校里还学得多。”随后又小声笑着说：“我顶怕离开车床，我如果一天不在车床上工作心里就会怪难受的。我喜欢在车床上干活，就像一个美术家喜欢做他的雕塑一样。我们的工业部长问过：‘孟斯卡·伊姆莱同志，你愿意做管理工厂的工作吗？’我说：‘部长同志，你要我做什么工作，我都愿意，我听从你的分配。假如你还要让我考虑的话，我还是想继续改进机器。这个工作我有把握，我一定能够做出成绩来。如果让我在车床上工作完了再来作别的工作，我也是愿意的。’我很高兴没有叫我离开车床。”随即他问我：“你们中国有很好的镟工吗？对车床有什么重要的改进没有？”
    我说中国镟工改进了什么机器，我还不知道。这方面的知识，我很缺乏。但我知道的是钳工和刨工，他们对于机器都作了重大的改进。我就把钳工张明山创造反围盘的经过告诉他听。碰到有些工业术语很难翻译时，我就画图，还用两枝钢笔当作钳子挟钢条比划给他看。他明白之后，大为兴奋，还连说两次：
    “我明天一定要把这个创造告诉我们厂里的工人同志。”稍停一下，他又很高兴地说：“我真愉快，中国已有这样的工人。”
    我也高兴地说：
    “我也高兴，匈牙利有你这样的工人，热爱国家，热爱工作，热爱学习。努力改进机器，我一定要把你的事迹告诉我们中国人民。”
    接着我又问他：
    “你除了经常研究数学、机械学外，还读些别的书吗？”
    他看了我一下，微笑着说：
    “我也喜欢读裴多菲的诗哪。”
    送我们走出屋外时，他还用手电筒照了一下屋后积雪的空地说：
    “我还喜欢种花啊。要是你春天来我这里，一定会高兴看到我们这个小花园的。”
