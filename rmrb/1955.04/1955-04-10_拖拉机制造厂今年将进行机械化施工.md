    Tractor Factory to Implement Mechanized Construction This Year
    China's first newly built tractor factory will implement mechanized construction in 1955. Several hundred construction machines needed for the construction have already been transported to the construction site from various locations. These machines include bulldozers, soil compactors, and various types of lifting equipment. One bulldozer alone can replace the work of one hundred and fifty people.
    These machines will first be used in the welfare buildings and other projects that will soon be under construction, to create mechanized construction experience for building the factory buildings. Currently, workers are familiarizing themselves with the operation technology of these machines.
    Drilling workers who have been working on the construction base of the tractor factory for one year and eight months have recently submitted the technical design data for the last batch of workshops and factory buildings to be built at this factory. From now on, the drilling work for the construction foundations of the factory's plant area, welfare building area, railways, highways, bridges, and water supply will be successfully completed.

    拖拉机制造厂今年将进行机械化施工
    我国新建的第一个拖拉机制造厂一九五五年将进行机械化施工。施工所需的几百台建筑机械已经从各地运到工地。这些机械中有铲土机、压土机和各种类型的起重设备等。其中一台铲土机就能顶替一百五十个人的工作。
    这些机械将先在不久就要施工的福利建筑和其他工程上使用，为建设厂房创造机械化施工经验。目前，工人们正在熟悉这些机械的操纵技术。
    在拖拉机制造厂建筑基地上工作了一年又八个月的钻探职工们，最近已经把这个厂确定在最后建设的一批车间厂房的技术设计资料提交出来。从此，这个厂的厂区、福利建筑区、铁路、公路、桥梁、供水等建筑基础的钻探工作就胜利完成了。　（据新华社讯）
