Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to the Press Trust of India, Kotane, leader of the African National Congress of South Africa, and Kachalia, leader of the South African Indian Congress, spoke in New Delhi on the 3rd about the racial oppression suffered by people of color in the Federation of South Africa. They were passing through New Delhi on their way to Bandung to present a complaint to the upcoming Asian-African Conference. They said that for people of color, South Africa is effectively a "police state."

Kotane said that although Africans constitute the majority of the population of the Federation of South Africa, they have no rights whatsoever.

Kotane said: Africans need more land. Currently, Africans, who make up more than 67 percent of the population, have only 13 percent of the land, while 87 percent of the land is owned by or reserved for whites, who make up only 20 percent of the population.

Kachalia said: The "Group Areas Act" is aimed at Asians, with the purpose of depriving them of their property and ultimately forcing them to leave South Africa. Under this law, people of Asian descent are divided into three groups: Indians, Chinese, and Malays. They can only live in areas designated for them, which are often many miles away from cities. During the relocation, their property is often confiscated under one pretext or another.

Kachalia said: The government uses laws suppressing communists to persecute anyone who opposes the segregation policy. The government also uses this law to persecute colored leaders of national liberation movements, trade union leaders, and leaders of other organizations that fight for the rights and justice of all ethnic groups in South Africa.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 5th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech at a public rally at Ramlila Ground in Delhi on the 3rd.

Speaking about the racial persecution policies of the Government of the Federation of South Africa, Nehru said that the racial persecution policies of the Government of the Federation of South Africa are inhumane and unprecedented. India is not prepared to tolerate the persecution of millions of Africans and Indians by the Government of the Federation of South Africa. He said that thousands upon thousands of innocent Africans and Indians in South Africa are being driven from their homes without compensation. This insane white policy is very dangerous for the current world. He also criticized the United Nations for its indifferent attitude towards this issue.

Nehru mentioned the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, saying that if all countries accept these principles, there would be no conflict in the world.

Speaking about the Manila Treaty, Nehru said that this treaty undermines the entire atmosphere of Asia. It has reached such an absurd point that it insists on providing "help" even to countries that do not need "help."

    谈南非联邦有色人种遭受种族压迫的情况
    尼赫鲁总理谴责南非联邦政府的种族迫害政策
    据新华社讯　据印度报业托辣斯消息，南非的非洲人国民大会领袖柯坦和南非印度人大会领袖卡查利亚三日在新德里谈到南非联邦有色人种遭受种族压迫的情况。他们是路过新德里去万隆向快要召开的亚非会议提出控诉的。他们说，对有色人种来说，南非实际上是一个“警察国家”。
    柯坦说，虽然非洲人占南非联邦人口的多数，但是他们毫无权利可言。
    柯坦说：非洲人需要有更多的土地。目前，占人口百分之六十七以上的非洲人只有百分之十三的土地，而百分之八十七的土地却为只占人口百分之二十的白人所占有，或者为他们而保留起来。
    卡查利亚说：“种族分区隔离法”是针对亚洲人的，其目的在剥夺他们的财产，最后强迫他们离开南非。在这个法律下，有亚洲人血统的人被分为三个集团：印度人、中国人和马来亚人。他们只能住在划给他们的地区内，这些地区离城市往往有好多英哩。在迁移时，他们的财产往往在这样或者那样的借口下被没收。
    卡查利亚说：政府利用镇压共产党的法律来迫害反对隔离政策的任何人。政府也利用这条法律来迫害民族解放运动的有色人领袖、工会领袖及争取南非各族人民的权利和正义的其他组织的领袖。
    新华社新德里五日电　印度总理尼赫鲁三日在德里拉姆利拉广场的一次公众集会上发表了演说。
    尼赫鲁在谈到南非联邦政府的种族迫害政策时说，南非联邦政府的种族迫害政策是非人道的和史无前例的。印度不准备容忍南非联邦政府对成百万非洲人和印度人的迫害。他说，南非的成千成万无辜的非洲人和印度人被从家里赶走，并且得不到赔偿。这种疯狂的白种人政策对当前的世界是很危险的。他还批评联合国在这个问题上采取不问不闻的态度。
    尼赫鲁提到和平共处的五项原则说，如果所有的国家都接受这些原则，那么世界上就不会有冲突。
    尼赫鲁在谈到马尼拉条约时说，这个条约破坏了亚洲的整个气氛。它达到了这样荒唐的地步，对那些不需要“帮助”的国家也硬要提供“帮助”。
