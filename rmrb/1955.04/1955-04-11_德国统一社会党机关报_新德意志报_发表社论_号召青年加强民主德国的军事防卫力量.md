Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 9th. The "Neues Deutschland," organ of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, published an editorial on April 3rd entitled "This is the Time to Take Safety Measures," calling on young people to join the Barracked People's Police to strengthen the military defense forces of the German Democratic Republic.

    The editorial first refuted the claim by some West German newspapers that there would be a long period of time between the ratification and implementation of the Paris Agreements. The editorial pointed out that the cadre force of the West German 500,000-strong army would be formed in the coming months. The first batch of $750 million worth of American military supplies has already begun to be shipped to West Germany. More than 400 West German manufacturers are already engaged in arms production. The editorial said that France and the German Democratic Republic are the first victims of the American imperialists' and German imperialists' plans for world hegemony. However, the working people of the German Democratic Republic are absolutely unwilling to sacrifice their construction achievements and fall back into the slavery of monopoly capitalists and Junker landlords.

    The editorial said that one of the most important measures to guarantee peace is to strengthen the German Democratic Republic and its military defense forces.

    The editorial demanded that all members of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany recognize the seriousness of the situation after the ratification of the Paris Agreements. The editorial, in pointing out the glorious fighting tradition of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and its current task of leading the working class and all working people in defending democracy and socialism, said:

  “The workers of state-owned factories will organize strong fighting teams, and the Party will do everything possible to develop disciplined and combat-ready teams in factories, rural areas, and administrative organs. Members of the fighting teams should regard it as a glorious task to master the weapons for defending the construction achievements of the German working people.”

    The editorial then said: Young people volunteering to serve in the Barracked People's Police for two years will be of great significance for defending the motherland and consolidating and strengthening our national power. A large number of young people are already serving in the People's Police, and their training period has expired and they are about to return to their professional lives. We must ensure that the Barracked People's Police receive adequate personnel in a timely manner. Therefore, "young people, especially members and probationary members of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany between the ages of 18 and 22, will be asked to join the Barracked People's Police in order to use the strength and vigor of youth to defend the people's peaceful work and to politically and technically strengthen our defense institutions."

    The editorial concluded: "This is our clear answer to the West German militarists."
    
Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 9th. The broad masses of young people in the German Democratic Republic continue to respond to the call issued by "Neues Deutschland," the organ of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, calling on young people to join the Barracked People's Police and strengthen the national defense forces.

    According to the German News Agency, many young workers at the Berlin Cable Manufacturing Plant have already signed up to join the Barracked People's Police. At a meeting of the Free German Youth League, 300 students from Humboldt University in Berlin stated that they would take up arms to defend the motherland at any time if the government deemed it necessary. At a gathering, the Greater Berlin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions of the Free German Trade Union Federation, representing 12,000 Berlin teachers and staff, made a guarantee that they would explain the significance of defense deployments to young students. Students at the Karl Marx Stadt Mother Machine Manufacturing Technical School expressed their readiness to join the People's Police after graduating from the engineering examination in June this year. In Eisleben, Mansfeld mines, 45 young miners have signed up to join the People's Police. In Stralsund, shipyard workers held a meeting on the 4th to discuss the tasks of workers in strengthening the republic. Many young shipbuilding workers decided to master shooting techniques in the Sports Technology Association. In Rostock, 71 young dockworkers have already signed up to join the Barracked People's Police.

    德国统一社会党机关报“新德意志报”发表社论
    号召青年加强民主德国的军事防卫力量
    新华社柏林九日讯　德国统一社会党机关报“新德意志报”三日以“这是采取安全措施的时候了”为题发表社论，号召青年参加宿营人民警察加强德意志民主共和国的军事防卫力量。
    社论首先驳斥了某些西德报纸所谓在巴黎协定的批准和实施之间还将有一段很长的时间的说法，社论指出：西德五十万军队的干部队在最近几个月里就要组成。第一批七亿五千万美元的美国军火已经开始运往西德。西德四百多家厂商已经在进行军备生产。社论说：法国和德意志民主共和国是美帝国主义者和德帝国主义者世界霸权计划中的第一个牺牲品。但是，德意志民主共和国的劳动人民决不愿意牺牲他们的建设成就，重新堕入独占资本家和容克地主的奴役中。
    社论说：保证和平的最重要措施之一，便是加强德意志民主共和国和它的军事防卫力量。
    社论要求德国统一社会党全体党员认清巴黎协定批准后的形势的严重性。社论在指出德国统一社会党光荣的战斗传统和目前领导工人阶级及全体劳动人民保卫民主和社会主义的事业的任务时说：
  “国营工厂的工人将组织强有力的战斗队，党将尽一切力量在工厂中、农村中和行政机关中发展有纪律的和有战斗准备的队伍。战斗队的成员应该把掌握保卫德国劳动人民的建设成就的武器当作光荣的任务。”
    社论接着说：青年们志愿在宿营人民警察中服役两年将对保卫祖国与巩固和加强我们国家力量具有重大的意义。现在已经有很大一部分青年在人民警察队伍中服役，他们的训练时间已经满期，就要回到职业生活中去。我们必须使宿营人民警察及时地得到足额的人员。因此，“青年们，特别是十八岁到二十二岁的德国统一社会党党员和候补党员们，将被要求加入宿营人民警察队伍，以便用青年的力量和蓬勃的朝气保卫人民的和平工作，并在政治上、技术上加强我们的防卫机构。”
    社论最后说：“这便是我们对西德军国主义者一个明白的回答。”
    新华社柏林九日电　德意志民主共和国广大青年继续响应德国统一社会党机关报“新德意志报”发出的要求青年加入宿营人民警察、加强国家防卫力量的号召。
    据德意志通讯社报道，柏林电线制造厂的许多青年工人已经报名参加宿营人民警察。柏林洪堡大学三百名学生在一次自由德国青年联盟的会议上表示，一旦政府认为必要，他们将随时拿起武器保卫祖国。自由德国工会联合会大柏林市教职员工会在一个集会上代表一万二千名柏林教职员提出保证，他们将向青年学生讲解保卫部署的意义。卡尔·马克思斯塔特母机制造专科学校学生表示，准备在今年六月工程师考试结业后参加人民警察队伍。在埃斯列滨、曼斯费尔德矿场，有四十五名青年矿工报名参加人民警察。在斯特拉尔松，船坞工人四日举行集会，讨论了工人在加强共和国方面的任务。有许多青年造船工人决定在体育技术协会中掌握射击技术。在罗斯托克，已经有七十一名青年船坞工人报名参加宿营人民警察。
