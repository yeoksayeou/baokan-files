    The convocation of the National Congress of the Communist Party of China is of great significance to the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation in our country during the transition period. This National Congress of the Party presented the draft of the first five-year plan for the development of our national economy and adopted a resolution on this draft plan; the meeting discussed the crimes of the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance and adopted a resolution on the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance, deciding to expel Gao Gang, the head of the anti-Party conspiracy and a traitor who refused to repent, from the Party, to expel Rao Shushi, another head of the anti-Party conspiracy, from the Party, and to remove them from all positions inside and outside the Party; the meeting also adopted a resolution on the establishment of the Central and local Supervisory Committees of the Party and established the Central Supervisory Committee.
    The resolutions adopted by this National Congress of the Party will undoubtedly have a huge positive impact on the life of our Party and country. This meeting fully developed criticism and self-criticism, exposed many shortcomings and errors in the work of the Party and the state, and pointed out ways to overcome these shortcomings and errors. The thinking of all comrades in the Party is more unified, and on this basis the unity and solidarity of the entire Party is more consolidated. This is of decisive significance for the cause of our Party, especially for the smooth realization of the Party's general line during the transition period.
    Our Party Central Committee put forward the general line of the Party during the transition period in 1952, and it was accepted by the National People's Congress in 1954 and included in our country's constitution, becoming the general task of the state during the transition period. Relying on the efforts of all comrades in the Party and the people of the whole country, the important policies and measures adopted by our Party and government have been implemented quite smoothly in all aspects and have achieved great results. However, in a large country like ours, the situation is complex and the national economy was originally very backward, so building a socialist society is not an easy task. We may build a socialist society through three five-year plans, but to build it into a strong and highly socialist industrialized country will require decades of arduous efforts, for example, fifty years, that is, the entire second half of this century.
    Precisely because the historical tasks we are to accomplish are so arduous, our cause is extremely great and glorious. All comrades in the Party and the people of the whole country must intensify their efforts, gradually develop the national economy, and gradually realize the general task of the transition period with firm and consistent steps.
    The first five-year plan for the development of our national economy is a major step in realizing the general task of the transition period. The first five-year plan has actually been implemented for more than two years, and we have accumulated a lot of experience, which makes us more confident in leading the large-scale and planned construction of the national economy. Is it too late to decide on this first five-year plan after it has been implemented for two years? It is not too late. Our country is a backward agricultural country in terms of economy, resources have not been investigated, the level of technology is very low, and there are still multiple economic components coexisting at the same time, all of which are objective difficulties in formulating an economic plan. From the subjective point of view, our Party has never had the experience of formulating a long-term construction plan, and shortly after the founding of the country, it was engaged in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. Therefore, in the past, it could only carry out construction while formulating a plan. In fact, the work of compiling the five-year plan began in the spring of 1951, and the actual planned construction began in 1953. Now, with two years of practical experience, the formulation of the entire five-year plan is closer to reality. This is only good for our country's planned construction and not bad.
    The National Congress of the Party, based on the actual experience of the recovery phase of our national economy and the economic construction of more than two years, carefully discussed the draft of the first five-year plan, made a resolution, and suggested that the Party Central Committee make necessary revisions to the draft five-year plan so that it could be submitted to the Second Session of the First National People's Congress for deliberation and approval, and used it as our country's plan. This is completely correct.
    The basic task of the first five-year plan is to lay a preliminary foundation for the complete realization of our country's general task during the transition period, that is, this first five-year plan should make our country take a big step in the process of gradually realizing the socialist industrialization of the country and the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce. During the first five-year plan, all aspects of our country's industry, agriculture, transportation, urban construction, commerce, culture and education will have considerable development, but the focus of development must be heavy industry. Although our country's agriculture is backward, and the output of grain and various industrial raw materials is far from meeting the current needs of the country and must be vigorously developed; our country's railways and other transportation facilities are also insufficient and need to be expanded; however, the financial resources we can use for the construction of the five-year plan are limited after all, and should not be used equally, otherwise nothing will be accomplished. Giving priority to the development of heavy industry is the key to changing the backward state of our country's agriculture, transportation, and other aspects, and it is also the key to expanding light industry and systematically improving people's lives. Under the current international situation, in order to strengthen our national defense, liberate Taiwan, combat imperialist aggression, and safeguard our country's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, it is especially necessary to develop heavy industry.
    For such a purpose, the people of our country should be mobilized together, whether on that front or in that specific job position, everyone should work diligently to carry out creative labor, strive to increase production, practice strict economy, closely cooperate with each other, and jointly strive to complete and overfulfill the first five-year plan. After the construction projects in the plan are completed, our country will have an electric power industry, coal mining industry, and petroleum industry that are one to several times larger than the current output; it will have a powerful modernized iron and steel industry, non-ferrous metal industry, and basic chemical industry; it will have the ability to manufacture large-scale metal cutting machine tools and power, metallurgy, and mining machinery; it will be able to manufacture automobiles, tractors, and airplanes on a large scale. By that time, people will see that many huge and unprecedented factories have been built on the land of our motherland, many new railways have been built, and many construction projects in agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy have been completed. Our country's productivity will be greatly improved, and new industrial bases will appear in the inland areas of our country. Our country's economic landscape will undergo important changes. Therefore, the first five-year plan is a great construction plan that guides our country to advance along the socialist road, making our country prosperous and strong and our people live a happy life.
    Today our Party is leading the broad masses of working people to fight for the realization of this first five-year plan and to build our country into a great socialist country. This is a more profound and extensive revolution than the new democratic revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. The result of this revolution is the elimination of all exploitation systems in our country, so a severe class struggle is inevitable. As early as February 1954, our Party's Seventh Central Committee at its Fourth Plenary Session had already warned the Party and outside the Party:
    "In this struggle, on the one hand, foreign imperialism will never sit idly by; on the other hand, those classes that have been overthrown domestically will never be reconciled to their demise, and those classes that will be eliminated will never be without resistance. The resolute counter-revolutionaries among them will inevitably collude with foreign imperialism, using every opportunity to undermine the cause of our Party and the people, attempting to make the Chinese revolution fail and restore reactionary rule in China. One of the most important methods for imperialists and counter-revolutionaries to undermine us is to first undermine the unity of our Party and find their agents within our Party."
    The conspiracy of the individualistic ambitious schemers Gao Gang and Rao Shushi's anti-Party alliance, which was exposed around the Fourth Session of the Seventh Central Committee of our Party, is a sharp manifestation of this serious class struggle within our Party.
    Facts have proved that the heads of this anti-Party conspiracy, Gao Gang and Rao Shushi, and their followers meticulously carried out conspiratorial activities, formed secret factions, planned and systematically sowed discord everywhere, carried out anti-Party propaganda, and did not tell the truth in front of the Party's organization and Party meetings. Their activities were completely the kind of ugly activities that the landlord class and the bourgeoisie have often taken in history. This anti-Party conspiratorial group, behind the back of the Party Central Committee, tried its best to slander our Party, slander the history of our Party, and slander our People's Liberation Army. Their criminal purpose was to use conspiratorial activities to split our Party, usurp the supreme power of the Party and the state, and open the way for the restoration of counter-revolution. They actually became agents of imperialism and the bourgeoisie within our Party.
    But our Party is solid, and the enemy's and anti-Party elements' vicious conspiracies cannot achieve their goals. Under the united leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, our entire Party timely exposed and thoroughly crushed the enemy's conspiracy, and achieved a great victory in the struggle against the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance. This once again proves that our Party is a strong and invincible Party built in accordance with the ideological and organizational principles of Marxism-Leninism, and proves that our Party is good at clearing out conspirators and traitors from within its own ranks, and using the power of unity and solidarity to strive for the complete victory of the working class's revolutionary cause.
    Our Party has repeatedly defeated traitors and anti-Party elements in history. The struggle against the traitor Chen Duxiu's faction in 1927 and the struggle against the traitor Zhang Guotao in 1935 both occurred during periods of intense changes in class relations and extremely tense class struggle. The victory of the struggle ensured that the Party could repel the class enemy's vicious attacks on the Party at critical junctures in the development of the revolution, so that the revolutionary cause could advance victoriously. Now our Party has crushed the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance. Due to the victory of this struggle, our Party is more united and consolidated than ever before. This is another victory of decisive significance in the entire development history of our Party, and it is an important guarantee for the smooth progress of the socialist cause of our people.
    In view of the urgent importance of strengthening Party discipline in the face of the fierce class struggle during the transition period, the National Congress of the Party adopted a resolution on the establishment of the Central and local Supervisory Committees of the Party, and established the Central Supervisory Committee, in order to strengthen the struggle against various violations of law and discipline among Party members, especially to prevent the recurrence of events like the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance that seriously endanger the interests of the Party.
    The sacred duty of our Communists and Party organizations at all levels is to serve the people wholeheartedly and to strive sincerely for the great ideal of communism. Our Party encourages every Party member to fully develop and continuously improve their talents and wisdom, but at the same time our Party must implement strict and systematic supervision of the work of any Party member through a certain organization. Without supervision from top to bottom and from bottom to top, a good Party member may also make serious mistakes and even turn bad. Foreign imperialists and domestic counter-revolutionaries are constantly spying on us. They all know that to undermine the cause of the Chinese people, the most powerful way is to first attack the leadership of the Chinese people and the Chinese working class – the Communist Party of China. They know that fortresses are easiest to capture from within, and they are constantly trying to use the most wavering and unreliable elements within our Party, through them to split our Party, to corrupt our Party, in order to most smoothly realize their counter-revolutionary restoration conspiracy. Therefore, our entire Party must learn lessons from past events, draw lessons from them, and strengthen the Party's supervisory role a hundredfold.
    For us Communists, the Party's supervision is to ensure the implementation of the Party's line, policies, Party constitution, Party discipline, and the laws and decrees of the state, to consolidate the Party's ties with the masses of the people, and to correct errors in a timely manner. Strengthening the Party's supervision can effectively oppose individualistic tendencies and complacency, which are the mortal enemies of every Communist Party member. We know that we will never fail to encounter difficulties on our road forward. Imperialist forces are still surrounding us, and we must be prepared to deal with possible sudden events; domestic counter-revolutionaries are still waiting for opportunities to attack us, and we may encounter even greater difficulties than in the past. This requires every Communist Party member, especially responsible Party members, to never be arrogant, to never have any personal plans, to rely on the wisdom and strength of the masses of the people, to rely on the collective wisdom and strength of the Party, to work diligently and with full confidence to overcome any difficulties and strive for the great victory of the socialist cause.
    In carrying out the socialist revolution in a China with 600 million people, the responsibility borne by our Party and its every Party member is great. However, as long as our entire Party is united, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and closely relies on the working class and the broad masses of the people, we will certainly be able to realize the Party's general line during the transition period and complete our revolutionary tasks and construction tasks. We are a new force, and the new force has always been invincible, and all old forces will always be eliminated. We have already achieved great victories, and we will surely achieve even greater victories. Let all comrades of the Party and the people of the whole country march forward with greater confidence, striving for the thorough realization of the Party's general line during the transition period!

### 为实现党的全国代表会议的决议而奋斗

    为实现党的全国代表会议的决议而奋斗
    中国共产党全国代表会议的召开，对于我国过渡时期的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业具有重大的意义。这次党的全国代表会议提出了关于发展我国国民经济的第一个五年计划草案，通过了关于这个计划草案的决议；会议讨论了高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的罪恶，通过了关于高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的决议，决定了开除反党阴谋的首脑和死不悔改的叛徒高岗的党籍，开除反党阴谋的另一名首脑饶漱石的党籍，并撤销他们的党内外各项职务；会议还通过了关于成立党的中央和地方监察委员会的决议，产生了中央监察委员会。
    这次党的全国代表会议通过的各项决议，无疑地将会在我们的党和国家生活中发生巨大的积极的作用。这次会议充分展开了批评和自我批评，揭发了党的工作和国家工作中的许多缺点和错误，指出了克服这些缺点和错误的办法。全党同志的思想更加一致了，在这个基础上全党的团结和统一更加巩固了。这对于我们党的事业，特别是对于党在过渡时期的总路线的顺利实现是有决定性的意义的。
    我们的党中央在一九五二年就提出了党在过渡时期的总路线，并于一九五四年由全国人民代表大会接受，列入了我国的宪法，成为国家在过渡时期的总任务。依靠全党同志和全国人民的努力，我们的党和政府采取的各项重要的政策和办法，在各方面都相当顺利地在执行着，有了很大的成绩。但是，在我们这样一个大国里，情况是复杂的，国民经济原来又很落后，要建成社会主义社会，并不是轻而易举的事。我们可能经过三个五年计划建成社会主义社会，但要建成为一个强大的高度社会主义工业化的国家，就需要有几十年的艰苦努力，譬如说，要有五十年的时间，即本世纪的整个下半世纪。
    正因为我们要完成的历史任务是这样的艰巨，我们的事业就是极其伟大和光荣的。我们全党同志和全国人民必须加紧努力，以坚定的一致的步伐，逐步地发展国民经济，逐步地实现过渡时期的总任务。
    发展我国国民经济的第一个五年计划，是实现过渡时期总任务的一个重大步骤。第一个五年计划实际上已经执行两年多了，我们已经积累了许多经验，这就使我们更有信心领导国民经济的大规模的有计划的建设。在执行了两年以后才来决定这第一个五年计划，这是否太迟了呢？并不太迟。我国在经济上是一个落后的农业国，资源没有调查，技术水平很低，目前仍然有多种经济成份同时并存，这些都是编制经济计划的客观困难。从主观方面说，我们党从来没有编制长期建设计划的经验，在建国以后不久又从事于抗美援朝战争，因此，过去只能一面进行建设，一面编制计划。实际上编制五年计划的工作从一九五一年春季就开始了，一九五三年又开始了实际的有计划的建设。现在有了两年的实践经验，就使整个五年计划的制定更加接近了实际。这对于我国有计划的建设只有好处没有坏处。
    党的全国代表会议根据我国国民经济恢复阶段和两年多以来的经济建设的实际经验，认真地讨论了第一个五年计划的草案，做出决议，建议党中央对五年计划草案再作必要的修正，以便提交全国人民代表大会第一届第二次会议予以审议和通过，把它作为我们国家的计划。这是完全正确的。
    第一个五年计划的基本任务是为完全实现我国过渡时期的总任务打下初步的基础，就是说，这第一个五年计划要使我国在逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化、逐步完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的进程中迈出一大步。在第一个五年计划期间，我国的工业、农业、交通运输、城市建设、商业、文化教育等各方面都要有相当的发展，但是发展的重点必须是重工业。虽然我国的农业是落后的，粮食和各种工业原料的产量远不能适应目前国家的需要，必须大力发展；我国的铁路和其他交通设备也是不足的，也很需要加以扩建；但是，我们能够使用于五年计划建设的财力毕竟是有限度的，不应该平均使用，否则必然一事无成。优先发展重工业，正是改变我国农业、运输业和其他方面的落后状态的关键，也是扩大轻工业、有系统地改善人民生活的关键。而在目前的国际形势下，为着加强我们的国防，解放台湾，打击帝国主义的侵略，维护我国的独立主权和领土完整，尤其必须发展重工业。
    为了这样的目的，我们全国人民应该一致动员起来，无论在那一个战线上、那一个具体的工作岗位上，大家都要勤劳地进行创造性的劳动，努力增产，厉行节约，彼此密切协作，共同争取完成和超额完成第一个五年计划。在计划中的建设项目完成以后，我国将拥有比现在的产量增大一倍至几倍的电力工业、煤矿工业和石油工业；将有强大的现代化的钢铁工业、有色金属工业和基本化学工业；将有能力自己制造大型金属切削机床和动力、冶金、矿山的机械；将能够大规模地制造汽车、拖拉机和飞机。到了那时候，人们就将看到在我们祖国的大地上，建设起许多巨大的前所未有的工厂，建成许多新的铁路，完成许多农林水利方面的建设，我国的生产力将大大提高，我国内地将出现新的工业基地，我国的经济面貌将发生重要的改变。因此，第一个五年计划是引导我国沿着社会主义道路前进，使我们的国家繁荣富强、人民生活幸福的伟大建设计划。
    今天我们的党正在领导着广大劳动人民为实现这第一个五年计划而斗争，为把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而斗争。这是一个比反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的新民主主义革命更深刻、更广泛的革命。这个革命的结果就是我国一切剥削制度的消灭，因此严重的阶级斗争是不能避免的。还在一九五四年二月，我们党的七届四中全会已经向党内外提出警告：
    “在这场斗争中，一方面外国帝国主义决不会袖手旁观；另一方面国内那些已经被打倒的阶级决不会甘心于自己的死亡，那些将被消灭的阶级也决不会没有反抗，他们中的坚决反革命分子必然要和外国帝国主义互相勾结起来，利用每一个机会来破坏我们党和人民的事业，企图使中国革命事业归于失败，使反动统治在中国复辟。帝国主义者和反革命分子破坏我们的最重要的方法之一就是首先破坏我们党的团结，并在我们党内寻找他们的代理人。”
    在党的七届四中全会前后所揭露的个人主义野心家高岗和饶漱石的反党联盟的阴谋，就是这种严重的阶级斗争在我们党内的一个尖锐的表现。
    事实证明，这个反党阴谋的首脑高岗、饶漱石和他们的追随者处心积虑地进行阴谋活动，结成秘密宗派，有计划地有系统地到处挑拨离间，进行反党的宣传，而在党的组织和党的会议面前却什么真话也不说。他们的这种活动完全是地主阶级和资产阶级在历史上常常采取的那一类丑恶的活动。这个反党的阴谋集团背着党中央，曾极力诬蔑我们的党，诬蔑我们党的历史，诬蔑我们的人民解放军。他们的罪恶目的是用阴谋活动来分裂我们的党，篡夺党和国家的最高权力，而为反革命的复辟开辟道路。他们实际上成了帝国主义和资产阶级在我们党内的代理人。
    但是我们党是巩固的，敌人和反党分子的凶恶阴谋是不可能达到目的的。我们全党在以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会团结一致的领导下，及时地揭露了和彻底地粉碎了敌人的阴谋，取得了对高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的斗争的伟大胜利。这再次证明了我们的党是按照马克思列宁主义的思想原则和组织原则而建设起来的坚强的不可战胜的党，证明了我们的党善于从自己队伍内部清除阴谋家和叛徒，用统一和团结的力量来争取工人阶级革命事业的彻底胜利。
    我们的党在历史上曾多次战胜叛徒和反党分子。一九二七年反对叛徒陈独秀分子的斗争，一九三五年反对叛徒张国焘的斗争，都是在阶级关系激烈变化、阶级斗争十分紧张的时期发生的。斗争的胜利保证了党能够在革命发展的紧要关头打退阶级敌人对党的凶恶进攻，使革命事业胜利前进。现在我们的党又粉碎了高岗、饶漱石的反党联盟。由于这个斗争的胜利，我们的党比以往任何时候都更加团结和巩固了。这是我们党的整个发展历史中的又一个有决定意义的胜利，这是我国人民社会主义事业顺利进行的重要保证。
    鉴于在过渡时期激烈的阶级斗争的形势下加强党的纪律的迫切重要性，党的全国代表会议通过了关于成立党的中央和地方监察委员会的决议，并且产生了中央监察委员会，以便加强反对党员中各种违法乱纪现象的斗争，特别是防止像高岗、饶漱石反党联盟这一类严重危害党的利益的事件重复发生。
    我们共产党人和党的各级组织的神圣天职就是要全心全意为人民服务，诚诚恳恳地为共产主义的远大理想而奋斗。我们的党鼓励每一个党员充分发挥和不断提高自己的才智，但同时我们的党必须经过一定的组织对任何一个党员的工作实行严格的有系统的监督。没有由上而下和由下而上的监督，一个好的党员也可能犯严重的错误以至变坏。外国帝国主义者和国内的反革命分子正在不断地窥伺着我们，他们都知道要破坏中国人民的事业，最厉害的办法莫如首先进攻中国人民和中国工人阶级的领导力量——中国共产党。他们懂得堡垒是最容易从内部夺取的，他们就无时无刻不力图利用我们党内最不坚定最不可靠的分子，经过他们来分裂我们的党，腐蚀我们的党，以便最顺利地实现他们的反革命复辟的阴谋。因此，我们全党必须从过去的事件中吸取教训，引为鉴戒，百倍加强党的监督作用。
    对于我们共产党人来说，党的监督是为着保证党的路线、政策、党章、党纪和国家的法律、法令的贯彻，是为着巩固党和人民群众的联系，是为着及时地纠正错误。加强党的监督可以有效地反对个人主义倾向和骄傲自满情绪，这是每一个共产党员的死敌。我们知道，在我们前进的道路上决不会不遇到困难的。帝国主义势力还在包围着我们，我们必须准备应付可能的突然事变；国内反革命分子还在伺隙向我们进攻，我们也许还会遇到比过去更大的困难。这就要求我们每一个共产党员，特别是负责的党员，决不骄傲，决不存任何个人打算，依靠人民群众的智慧和力量，依靠党的集体的智慧和力量，兢兢业业地而又满怀信心地为克服任何困难、争取社会主义事业的伟大胜利而斗争。
    在一个六万万人口的中国实行社会主义革命，我们的党和它的每一个党员所担负的责任是重大的。但是，只要我们全党团结一致，在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导下，紧紧依靠工人阶级，依靠广大人民群众，我们就一定能够实现党在过渡时期的总路线，完成我们的革命任务和建设任务。我们是新生的力量，而新生的力量从来是不可战胜的，一切旧势力总是要被消灭的。我们已经取得伟大的胜利，我们必将取得更加伟大的胜利。让我们全党同志和全国人民更加信心百倍地为党在过渡时期的总路线的彻底实现而奋勇前进吧！
