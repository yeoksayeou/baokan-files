Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 8th. Le Dinh Tham, Chairman of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace, published an article in the Vietnamese "People's Daily" on the 7th, welcoming the convening of the Asian Countries Conference.

The article said: The agenda of the Asian Countries Conference includes various extremely urgent issues related to the freedom and peaceful life of the Asian people. The Asian Countries Conference will further strengthen the unity of the Asian people and strengthen the struggle of the Asian people to ensure national independence and world peace.

The article said that the Vietnamese people warmly welcome the Asian Countries Conference and have sent a delegation to attend the conference. The Vietnamese delegation will show the Vietnamese people's determination to firmly implement the Geneva Accords, and at the same time condemn the US imperialism and its lackeys for undermining the Geneva Accords and forming the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. The Vietnamese delegation will contribute to consolidating the unity of the Asian people and safeguarding national rights, and opposing American-style colonialism.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 8th. The Indian "Free Press" published an editorial on the 6th, welcoming the Asian Countries Conference, saying: The Asian Countries Conference, which opened in New Delhi on the 6th, clearly proves the fact that everyone agrees that the acceptance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence by all countries is a prerequisite for easing the current international tensions. The editorial said: The acceptance of the Five Principles by Asian countries "can enable Asian countries to form a strong unity, and in the face of such consolidated unity, it is difficult—even impossible—for imperialist countries to interfere in Asia."

The editorial said: Who has been creating the danger of war in Asia is known to everyone. The editorial pointed out: "The activities of the US fleet near Taiwan against China, the Southeast Asia military group led by the imperialist countries in Asia, the conspiracy to undermine the hard-won armistice in Korea and Indochina, and the signing of military treaties to undermine the unity of Arab countries—all of these are obvious examples of the imperialist conspiracy against peace and security in Asia."

The editorial said that all important sectors of Indian society unreservedly support the Asian Countries Conference. The editorial expressed confidence that the Asian Countries Conference will achieve complete victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 8th. According to the Bulgarian News Agency, the Bulgarian "Fatherland Front" commented on the Asian Countries Conference on the 6th, saying that judging from the members of the Asian Countries Conference and the importance of the issues to be discussed, this conference is of great significance to the current international situation. The peace-loving people of the whole world, especially Asia, warmly welcome the convening of this conference and firmly believe that it will make resolutions that are conducive to peace and conducive to solving the most important issues related to the fate of the people of all countries.

Xinhua News Agency, April 8th. According to the Romanian News Agency Bucharest on the 7th: "Labor News" commented on the Asian Countries Conference on the 7th, saying that the great significance of this conference is closely related to the new situation in Asia. Asia has undergone tremendous historical changes after the Second World War. However, US imperialists and its lackeys are unwilling to accept this new situation in Asia. They attempt to stop the progress of the Asian people, incite the Asian people to hate each other, in order to launch a world war.

The commentary pointed out that the focus of the Asian Countries Conference will be to recognize the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the only solid foundation for establishing truly friendly and equal relations. Recognizing these principles will eliminate the policy pursued by the United States of organizing aggressive blocs in Asia and the heinous policy of strength.

    各国舆论欢迎召开亚洲国家会议
    新华社河内八日电　越南保卫世界和平委员会主席黎廷探七日在越南“人民报”发表文章，欢迎亚洲国家会议的召开。
    文章说：亚洲国家会议的议程包括关系着亚洲人民的自由、和平生活的极其迫切的各种问题。亚洲国家会议将进一步密切亚洲人民的团结，并加强亚洲人民确保民族独立和世界和平的斗争。
    文章说，越南人民热烈欢迎亚洲国家会议，并派遣了代表团出席这次会议。越南代表团将表明越南人民坚决履行日内瓦协议的意志，同时谴责美帝国主义及其仆从破坏日内瓦协议和成立东南亚侵略集团的行动。越南代表团将为巩固亚洲人民的团结和保卫民族的权利、反对美国式的殖民主义而贡献出力量。
    新华社新德里八日电　印度“自由报”六日发表社论，欢迎亚洲国家会议说：六日“在新德里开幕的亚洲国家会议清楚地证明了这样的事实：大家一致认为各国接受和平共处的五项原则是缓和目前的国际紧张局势的先决条件。”社论说：亚洲各国接受五项原则，就“可以使亚洲国家形成坚强的团结，在这样巩固的团结面前，帝国主义国家是难于——甚至不可能——在亚洲进行干涉的”。
    社论说：谁一直在亚洲制造战争危险，这是任何人都知道的。社论指出：“美国舰队在台湾附近进行的反对中国的活动，不是亚洲国家的帝国主义国家所领导组织的东南亚军事集团，破坏朝鲜和印度支那的艰苦取得的停战的阴谋，签订图谋破坏阿拉伯国家团结的军事条约——这一切都是帝国主义反对亚洲和平和安全的阴谋的明显的事例。”
    社论说，印度社会各重要阶层毫无保留地支持亚洲国家会议。社论表示相信亚洲国家会议将取得完全的胜利。
    新华社布拉格八日讯　据保加利亚通讯社消息，保加利亚“祖国阵线报”六日评论亚洲国家会议说，从亚洲国家会议的成员和将要讨论的问题的重要性来看，这个会议对目前的国际局势有非常重大的意义。全世界、特别是亚洲的爱好和平的人民热烈欢迎这个会议的召开，并且坚信它将作出有利于和平、有利于解决有关各国人民的命运的最重大的问题的决议。
    新华社八日讯　据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特七日讯：“劳动报”七日评论亚洲国家会议说，这个会议的重大意义是同亚洲新的形势密切联系着的。亚洲在第二次世界大战后已产生了具有历史意义的巨大改变。但是，美帝国主义者和它的仆从对于亚洲的这种新形势是不甘心的。它们企图阻止亚洲人民的进步，唆使亚洲人民互相仇视，以便发动世界大战。
    评论指出，亚洲国家会议讨论的中心将是承认和平共处的五项原则为建立真正友好、平等的关系的唯一稳固的基础。承认这些原则，就会排除美国所奉行的组织亚洲侵略集团的政策以及万恶的实力政策。
