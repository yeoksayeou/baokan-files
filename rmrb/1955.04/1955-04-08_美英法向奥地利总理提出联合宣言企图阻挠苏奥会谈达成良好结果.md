Xinhua News Agency, London, April 6th, TASS dispatch: The high commissioners of the UK, US, and France in Austria presented a joint declaration to Austrian Prime Minister Raab regarding the upcoming visit of the Austrian government delegation to Moscow. The content of this declaration reveals its purpose: to exert pressure on the Austrian government before the delegation departs, obstructing the Austrian government from achieving concrete and positive results in the Soviet-Austrian talks, and limiting Raab's purpose in going to Moscow to merely obtaining "certain explanations" from the Soviet government regarding its attitude on the Austrian question. The declaration stated: "The three governments believe that the Austrian government's decision to accept the Soviet invitation to Moscow will obtain beneficial explanations."
    The declaration emphasized that the issue of the Austrian peace treaty is a matter of concern to all four powers. However, the three high commissioners do not support the Soviet proposal for a four-power conference on the Austrian question, and instead propose that the issue of the Austrian peace treaty be discussed solely by the four-power ambassadors' meeting in Vienna, and that this meeting be held after the Austrian government delegation returns from Moscow.

    美英法向奥地利总理提出联合宣言企图阻挠苏奥会谈达成良好结果
    新华社七日讯　塔斯社伦敦六日讯：英、美、法三国驻奥地利高级专员为奥地利政府代表团即将赴莫斯科访问一事向奥地利总理拉布提出了一个联合宣言。从这个宣言的内容可以看出宣言的目的是：在代表团启程之前对奥地利政府施加压力，阻挠奥地利政府在苏、奥会谈中达成具体的、良好的结果，使拉布去莫斯科的目的仅限于从苏联政府获得它对奥地利问题态度的“某些解释”。宣言中说道：“三国政府相信，奥地利政府决定接受苏联的赴莫斯科的邀请将会获得有益的解释。”
    宣言中强调指出，对奥和约的问题是和四国都有关的问题。但是，三国高级专员并不支持苏联关于就奥地利问题举行四国会议的建议，而提议把对奥和约问题仅仅交给四国驻维也纳大使所召开的会议来讨论，而且这个会议要在奥地利政府代表团自莫斯科返国后举行。
