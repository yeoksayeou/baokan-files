Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, 31st – The Dutch House of Representatives concluded its two-day debate on the Paris Agreements today. The majority of members of the House of Representatives, despite opposition votes from Communist Party members and widespread public protests, passed the ratification of the Paris Agreements by a vote of 71 to 6.

On the evening of the 29th, while the House of Representatives was debating, a demonstration against the rearmament of West Germany took place in The Hague, attended by more than a thousand people. The demonstrators also sent a delegation to visit the members of parliament, expressing their opposition to the Paris Agreements. Communist Party members met with the delegation.

The day before the House of Representatives began discussing the Paris Agreements on the 29th, a mass rally against the rearmament of West Germany was held in Amsterdam. House of Representatives member Hoekstra spoke at the rally, severely criticizing the plan to establish a new German "Defense Force" near the Dutch border. He said, to the applause of the audience, that the struggle against the arming of West Germany would continue until the Paris Agreements were cancelled. The rally passed a resolution demanding that the parliament reject the Paris Agreements that threatened the security of the Netherlands.

    不顾人民抗议和共产党议员反对
    荷议会第二院批准巴黎协定
    新华社三十一日讯　海牙消息：荷兰议会第二院三十日结束了为时两天的关于巴黎协定的辩论。第二院的多数议员在共产党议员投票反对和广大人民抗议的情况下以七十一票对六票通过批准巴黎协定。
    二十九日晚间当议会第二院正在进行辩论时，海牙举行了有一千多人参加的反对重新武装西德的示威。示威群众并派遣代表团访问议员，表达他们反对巴黎协定的意志。共产党议员接见了代表团。
    在议会第二院二十九日开始讨论巴黎协定的前一天，阿姆斯特丹举行了反对重新武装西德的群众大会。议会第二院议员霍查克在会上发言，严厉指责在荷兰国境附近建立新德国“国防军”的计划。他在听众的掌声中说，反对武装西德的斗争将继续进行到巴黎协定被取消时为止。大会通过决议，要求议会否决威胁荷兰安全的巴黎协定。
