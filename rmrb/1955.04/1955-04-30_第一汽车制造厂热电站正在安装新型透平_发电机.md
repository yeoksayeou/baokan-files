    New Turbine Generator Being Installed at the First Automobile Works Thermal Power Plant
    A new type of turbine generator is being installed in the First Automobile Works thermal power plant. This turbine generator is a new product of the Soviet Union from the second half of 1954. Unlike ordinary turbine generators that use mechanical centrifugal force to adjust speed, it uses oil pressure to adjust speed; the various parts of the machine have many automatic protection devices.
    During the installation of this turbine generator, the Soviet government sent installation experts from the factory that manufactured the turbine generator and design experts who designed the speed control system for this turbine generator to our First Automobile Works to provide guidance and assistance.
    Now, the turbine generator is nearing completion. All the employees participating in the installation are particularly happy. Old engineer Wu Qufei said:
  “Using oil pressure to replace easily worn mechanical speed control is a revolution in the world's power equipment technology. In my more than 20 years as an engineer, I have never seen such equipment. Even in technical theory books from various countries, there is little record of it."
    Since the installation of this turbine generator began, people from all over have come to visit and learn. Among them are college students who are preparing to write their graduation theses, as well as technical and management personnel in the electrical and machinery manufacturing industries.

    第一汽车制造厂热电站正在安装新型透平—发电机
    第一汽车制造厂热电站内正在安装一种最新型的透平—发电机。这种透平—发电机是苏联一九五四年下半年的新产品。它不像一般的透平—发电机用机械离心力调整速度，而是用油压力调整速度；机器的各部分有很多自动化的保护装置。
    在安装这部透平—发电机时，苏联政府把制造这部透平—发电机的工厂的安装专家和设计这部透平—发电机调速系统的设计专家派到我国第一汽车制造厂来进行指导和帮助。
    现在，这部透平—发电机快要安装完毕。所有参加安装的职工特别高兴。老工程师吴去非说：
  “用油压力代替容易磨损的机械调速，是世界电力设备技术上的革命。在我二十多年的工程师的生活中也没有见过这样的设备。就是在各国技术理论书籍上也少有记载。”
    自从这部透平—发电机开始安装以来，各地前来参观、学习的人络绎不绝。他们中间，有的是正在准备作毕业论文的大学生，还有电业和机器制造业方面的技术人员和管理人员。
