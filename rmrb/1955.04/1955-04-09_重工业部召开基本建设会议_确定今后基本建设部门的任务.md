Xinhua News Agency, April 8th—The Ministry of Heavy Industry recently held a basic construction conference to summarize the experiences and lessons learned in basic construction over the past two years, expose and criticize shortcomings and errors in the work, and discuss and determine the tasks of basic construction departments in the future.
    The conference report pointed out that the Ministry of Heavy Industry completed 26 percent of the tasks in the draft Five-Year Plan in the past two years, and 74 percent of the tasks remain to be completed in the next three years. At the same time, the proportion of industrial construction will greatly increase in the next three years, and many new construction projects with large workloads and complex technologies will commence. The workload of industrial construction and equipment installation in 1955 will more than double that of 1954, and more than 30 important projects need to be completed and put into production. The conference believes that, in light of the increasing proportion of industrial construction, improving the organization and working methods of basic construction units and construction and installation enterprises, so that they transition from organizational forms and working methods suitable for civil construction and general industrial construction to forms that are more suitable for undertaking complex industrial construction, and striving to fully complete the state's construction plans to ensure the completion of construction projects on schedule and put into production, is the basic task of the Ministry of Heavy Industry's basic construction departments in the future.
    The conference report made serious criticisms and self-criticisms of the shortcomings and errors in past work, pointing out that some units have conservative tendencies in implementing state plans; various forms of departmentalism exist in the mutual cooperation among basic construction departments; some cadres lack sufficient understanding of the complexity of heavy industrial construction, lack overall planning in practical work, and lack a sense of planned completion on schedule, so many projects failed to be put into production as planned. The conference pointed out that there are still many serious waste phenomena and violations of financial discipline in planning, design, and construction. Many construction enterprises have insufficient construction preparation, resulting in very uneven construction. Due to weak technical management, many construction enterprises have many quality accidents, and the utilization rate of construction machinery and labor productivity are also very low. The conference also pointed out shortcomings such as the design work lagging behind the needs of national construction, low quality, neglecting economic issues, and administrative leaders of enterprises neglecting political and ideological work. In addition, participants in the conference also criticized the shortcomings and errors of the basic construction planning, design, construction, and geological departments, as well as the leadership of the ministry and bureau leadership organs being insufficiently specific and their dilatory work style.
    The conference believes that in the future, it is necessary to first strengthen overall planning and mutual cooperation in basic construction work, oppose the conservative tendencies in the implementation of plans and departmentalism in work, so that all departments such as geology, design, scientific research, construction, and production preparation can coordinate their work according to a unified plan and schedule, to ensure that fixed assets are put into production on schedule. At the same time, we should actively organize the construction industry to transition from civil construction to adapting to industrial construction, earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, do a good job in construction preparation, plan base construction, improve construction organization, actively and steadily promote industrialized and mechanized construction in major construction projects, strengthen technical management, improve technical level, ensure project quality, actively improve labor productivity in the construction and installation industry, reduce costs, and vigorously train cadres and reserve forces. Special attention should be paid to economic issues in basic construction, and active and negative factors in basic construction should be identified through economic activity analysis. The conference called on relevant departments to change the backward situation in design work, improve the level of design work, improve design quality, learn from the Soviet Union's complete sets of designs for iron and steel complexes, non-ferrous metal industries, chemical industries, and building materials industries, and pay attention to economic issues in design, and establish an economic work system.
    The conference especially requested that leaders at all levels pay close attention to the rational use of state funds, grasp the state investment plan, strengthen the analysis of investment effects, and correct and avoid waste in the use of investment. In design, attention should be paid to economic accounting, more design方案comparisons should be made, and construction costs should be reduced. In construction units, potential should be tapped to reduce construction and installation costs. Actively dispose of stockpiled equipment and materials, strengthen the turnover of funds, and at the same time strictly abide by financial discipline and fight against corruption and extravagance.
    The conference believes that doing a good job in various preparations before production is an important condition for ensuring that projects are put into production on schedule. Therefore, the production department is required to train technicians and skilled workers in advance, prepare raw materials, tools, and various technical materials in advance; at the same time, existing enterprises must plan to train technical cadres for new enterprises. The conference finally called on the administrative leaders of enterprises to pay special attention to political and ideological work.
    The Ministry of Heavy Industry's basic construction conference was held from March 15th to 22nd. The participants in this conference included responsible persons from basic construction units and construction and installation, geology, and design departments under the Ministry of Heavy Industry.

    重工业部召开基本建设会议
    确定今后基本建设部门的任务
    新华社八日讯　重工业部在最近召开基本建设会议，总结两年来基本建设方面的经验教训，揭露和批判工作中的缺点错误，并讨论和确定了今后基本建设部门的任务。
    会议的报告指出：重工业部在过去两年中完成了五年计划草案中百分之二十六的任务，还有百分之七十四的任务要在今后三年完成；同时今后三年工业建设的比重大大增加，许多工程量大、技术复杂的新建工程都将开工。一九五五年工业建筑和设备安装的工作量，比一九五四年增加一倍以上，需要完工投入生产的重要工程有三十多项。会议认为，根据工业建设比重增大的情况，改进基本建设单位及建筑安装企业的组织和工作方式，使它们从过去适合于民用建筑及一般的工业建筑的组织形式和工作方式，走向更适合于担负复杂的工业建设，并努力争取全面完成国家的建设计划，保证建设工程按期完工投入生产，是今后重工业部基本建设部门的基本任务。
    会议的报告中对过去工作的缺点错误，进行了严肃的批评和自我批评，指出一些单位在执行国家计划中存在保守倾向；各基本建设部门在相互协作中存在各种形式的本位主义；有些干部对重工业建设的复杂性认识不足，实际工作中缺乏通盘筹划，缺乏按期完工的计划观念，因而许多工程未能按计划要求投入生产。会议指出在计划、设计、施工方面仍然存在着许多严重的浪费现象和违犯财政纪律的现象，不少施工企业由于施工准备不够，使施工很不均衡；不少施工企业由于技术管理薄弱，质量事故很多，施工机械的利用率和劳动生产率也很低。会议还指出设计工作方面落后于国家建设需要、质量低劣和忽视经济问题以及企业行政领导干部忽视政治思想工作等缺点。此外，参加会议的人员对基本建设计划、设计、施工、地质各部门的缺点错误以及对部、局领导机关领导不具体、拖拉作风等缺点也提出了批评。
    会议认为：今后必须首先加强基本建设工作中的通盘筹划和相互协作，反对执行计划的保守倾向和工作中的本位主义，使地质、设计、科学研究、施工、生产准备等各部门，都按着统一的计划和进度协调地进行工作，保证按期使固定资产投入生产。同时，应该积极组织建筑工业由民用建筑走向适应工业建筑，认真学习苏联先进经验，作好施工准备工作，筹划基地建设，改善施工组织，在重大的建设工程中积极地稳步地推进工厂化机械化的施工，加强技术管理，提高技术水平，保证工程质量，积极地提高建筑安装工业的劳动生产率，降低成本，并大力培养干部和后备力量。特别要注意基本建设中的经济问题，从经济活动分析中寻找基本建设中的积极因素和消极因素。会议要求有关部门改变设计工作落后的状况，提高设计工作水平，提高设计质量，向苏联学习钢铁联合企业、有色金属工业、化学工业、建筑材料工业的成套设计，并注意设计中的经济问题，建立经济工作制度。
    会议特别要求各级领导干部要十分注意合理地运用国家资金，掌握国家投资计划，加强投资效果的分析，纠正和避免投资使用上的浪费现象。在设计上要注意经济核算，多作设计方案比较，降低造价。在施工单位中要发掘潜在力量，降低建筑安装成本。积极处理积压的设备材料，加强资金的周转，同时要严格遵守财政纪律，向贪污和铺张浪费现象作斗争。
    会议认为做好生产前的各项准备工作，是保证工程按期投入生产的重要条件。因此，要求生产部门必须事先训练好技术人员和技术工人，事先准备原材料、工具和各种技术资料；同时，现有企业必须有计划地为新企业培养技术干部。会议最后还要求企业的行政领导干部特别重视政治思想工作。
    重工业部的基本建设会议，是从三月十五日到二十二日举行的。参加这次会议的有重工业部所属基本建设单位和建筑安装、地质、设计等部门的负责人。
