Peace – The People's Wish
Zhou Erfu, Deputy Head of the People's Republic of China's Cultural Delegation to India

    As the plane approached the airspace above Delhi Airport, the capital of India, I saw a large crowd on the airport waving Chinese and Indian flags, warmly welcoming the special plane of the People's Republic of China's Cultural Delegation to India. We got off the plane. My eyes were immediately surrounded by a sea of waving flags and fluttering flowers. One garland after another was placed around our heads, until they reached our noses, and we could hardly see anything in front of us. Fortunately, someone helped to take the garlands off so that we could clearly see the crowd gathered in front of us; then came another garland, and we were almost unable to see again. The welcomers kept scattering red rose petals on us, which fell like large raindrops.

    Surrounded by red, yellow, and white flowers, surrounded by cheers, I could hardly distinguish who was saying what, or what slogans were being shouted, but there was one common voice, and that was:

    Long live Sino-Indian friendship!
    Long live peace!

    We brought the friendship of the Chinese government and people to the Indian government and people. The first step our feet took on Indian soil, we saw the friendship of the Indian government and people towards the Chinese government and people and their desire for peace.

    We saw friendship from the bottom of the people's hearts everywhere in India. In squares with tens of thousands of people, at receptions with thousands of people, at symposiums with hundreds of people, in conversations among a few people, even on the streets, we were all strangers, but everyone seemed like an old friend. I remember at the Red Fort in Delhi, when we came out of the palace where the Peacock Throne was placed, we found a middle-aged Indian man, who looked less than fifty years old, dressed in a white Indian national costume. He followed us, his mouth mumbling, his eyes always eagerly fixed on us. Finally, he excitedly walked up, shook my hand, and said:

    "I am an ordinary person in India. I heard that the Cultural Delegation of the People's Republic of China has arrived in New Delhi. I very much hoped to see you, even if it was just one member of the delegation, but I knew I would not have this opportunity. I never expected to meet you here. This is the greatest honor and comfort of my life. Sino-Indian friendship, long live peace!"

    The two of us held hands tightly, for a long, long time, neither of us letting go. Yes, he was an ordinary Indian. But he was not just an ordinary Indian; he represented the millions of Indian people speaking their hearts. We saw such ordinary Indians everywhere. Sometimes, we didn't even have to speak; a gesture, a look, a smile, and everyone understood what the other person wanted to say.

    Just take our attendance at the welcoming rally for the Cultural Delegation held by the Sino-Indian Friendship Association at Gandhi Square in Delhi. Let alone the excited words and warm applause at the welcome rally, or the boiling enthusiasm of the masses, just consider the section after the meeting when we walked out of the square. We got into the car next to the podium. Normally, it would take no more than half a minute to walk to the gate. But our car drove for at least ten minutes. The crowd was crowded on both sides of the walkway: men, women, old, young, one hand of Indian people's friendship stretched into the car, while holding it, saying:

    Sino-Indian friendship!
    Mao Zedong, Zindabad (Long live)!
    Long live peace!

    Some even shouted loudly. One friendly hand after another stretched into the car, almost filling the windows of the car. Young children were too short and could not reach in, so adults picked them up to let them reach in. The car was blocked by the crowd and could hardly move forward. With the guidance of the hosts, it slowly drove out with great difficulty, and the crowd on both sides kept sending warm applause and smiling eyes.

    In Ajanta, in Mumbai, in Madras, in Calcutta, we encountered the same touching scenes everywhere. Especially at the Bhopal and Jalgaon stations. We arrived at Bhopal Station at more than two o'clock in the morning on December 14th. As soon as the Cultural Delegation's special train entered the station, it was immediately surrounded by cheers that shook the night sky. As soon as the head of the Cultural Delegation got off the train, he was immediately crowded out by the people who had been waiting at the station for more than three hours; he didn't even need to walk, the jubilant crowd carried the members of the delegation to the podium that had been prepared in advance. The stars in the sky were shining, and the platform was illuminated like daytime by the torches. In the flickering lights and shadows, a woman walked over, holding a pot of lights in her hand, raised it over the heads of our delegation members, and then circled it in front of the members, and used her thumb to dip vermilion and put it on the forehead in the middle upwards. This is the highest national ritual of the Indian people, a ritual of mothers and sisters sending loved ones far away or on expeditions, and blessing them.

    At Jalgaon Station, it was another scene: as soon as the car stopped, the local person in charge came to negotiate, saying that there was a welcome meeting below and asked us to participate. We followed them. As soon as we went up to the overpass, as soon as we showed our faces, we heard thunderous cheers, one after another, overwhelming all the sounds at the station. When we came down, we simply couldn't know how many people were there. On the overpass, on the platform, at the station gate square, outside the gate, all the way to the distance of the road, you couldn't see the end, it was all people. There was no room for people on the road, and some people simply stood at the windows of their buildings, their eyes looking far at the station platform, at the Cultural Delegation of the People's Republic of China on the platform.

    Some people think that countries with two different social systems cannot be friends and cannot coexist peacefully. Yes, the social systems of China and India are different, but this cannot prevent our deep friendship. During my pleasant trip to India for nearly two months, many places, many people, and many facts answered this question.

    Mrs. Indira Gandhi, the daughter of Prime Minister Nehru, said it well:
  "These two great Asian countries, so similar and so different, the historic significance of the friendship between the two countries has been re-illuminated by Prime Minister Zhou Enlai's visit to India and our Prime Minister's visit to China. One of the most important facts that can be seen from these visits is that our two countries have such close cultural exchanges since ancient times that our differences in dealing with political and economic issues cannot prevent us." Mr. Jagla, Chief Justice of Mumbai Province, went even further and said: "Some people think that making friends with communist countries is a risk. He does not understand why smart people would seriously imagine this, as if the connection between countries can only be a political connection. China has many things worth studying, understanding, appreciating and learning." He also said: "When I think back to the historical, spiritual and religious connections that connect us; when we think of the recent past and the present, we have both suffered foreign rule, and we have both struggled against foreign rule, and today we have both gained freedom. The friendship between the people of our two countries is strong and perfect. I hope that unity will be produced from this friendship, and thus a force to defend peace will be issued."

    Dr. Kitchlew, Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, said even more thoroughly: "Three years ago, when we launched the noble principle of promoting peaceful coexistence, many people were deceived by those with vested interests and described such beautiful words as peaceful coexistence as 'evil', 'dangerous' and 'subversive'. But today, these words have penetrated the hearts of all ethnic people in the world; only people like Senator McCarthy would openly announce that they have discovered some 'evil', 'dangerous' and 'subversive' factors in peaceful coexistence."
      An Indian who calls himself "a conscientious democrat and a good citizen of the free world" said: He has always avoided the Communist Party, but has never seen a physical Communist. This time, at the grand gathering of the Mumbai film industry to welcome the Cultural Delegation of the People's Republic of China, he saw the Cultural Delegation and saw that the Communists are also ordinary people, ordinary polite, able to speak and laugh, and emotional men and women. On this occasion, when the masses shouted brothers and sisters, they regarded them as true brothers and sisters. Let's have a few more such cultural delegations to visit Asian countries, God save this free world.

    From the voice of this self-proclaimed "conscientious democrat and good citizen of the free world," we can see how the bosses of Wall Street in the United States have devastated the spirit of ordinary people, causing some people to lose their normal objective view of things. Even so, when faced with the facts, he had to change his attitude, restore his normal view, and hope to have exchanges with China and hope to be friends with China.

    The friendship between the Chinese and Indian people did not start today, it has a long history. The facts of recent years have proved that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by the Prime Ministers of China and India are not an ideal, but a noble principle that can be realized between countries in the world. The friendship between the nearly one billion people of China and India is a major force in maintaining peace in Asia and the world.

    On the evening of December 14th, we arrived in Gwalior from Agra, and the platform lights were crowded with welcoming crowds. The car drove into the station, the car door opened, and the road down the car door was blocked by the welcoming crowd that swarmed up. We couldn't get out of the car, so we met the welcoming crowd at the car door. In the crowded crowd, I found an old lady, wearing a deep gray sari with red edges, she was holding a child who looked less than two years old in her arms, and squeezed towards us with all her strength. The welcoming crowd slowly made way for her to walk through alone. She squeezed to the window with difficulty, panting, and took out a flag from her arms and handed it to the car door. We took it and opened it to see that it was a light cyan silk flag with a flying dove of peace embroidered on it with white thread. The welcoming crowd all saw this flag, and suddenly burst into applause. Her pair of large and deep eyes, full of kindness and wisdom, stared at us tightly. We could see what she wanted to say from her eyes: demanding peace, demanding Sino-Indian friendship!

    At Pipersu Station, we also received a very meaningful flag from the Pipersu Peace Committee. It was light gray with a white dove embroidered in the middle, the Indian flag in green, white and yellow on the left, and the flag of the People's Republic of China on the right. Does this need to be explained? The flag itself is the best and most powerful language: Sino-Indian friendship! Defend peace!

    We received countless such flags. Although we don't understand the languages ​​of various places in India, and the people of various places in India don't understand Chinese, we absolutely don't feel any language barrier between us, and language difficulties cannot prevent the expression of thoughts and the exchange of feelings between us.

    In Madras, on the night of the last day of 1954, the comrades of our Cultural Delegation attended the New Year's Eve party held by the All-India Conference for Peace and Asian Solidarity at the Kumarada Women's Art High School. When Indian famous comedian Krishnan announced that the last few minutes of 1954 were about to pass, the solemn moment of 1955 was coming, the comrades of our Cultural Delegation and the world's outstanding peace fighters attending the All-India Conference for Peace and Asian Solidarity walked onto the podium together. Among them were Professor Bernal, Vice Chairman of the World Peace Council, Mr. Lafitte, Secretary-General of the World Peace Council, Dr. Andelin, a Swedish peace activist, and Mrs. Strait, an Australian peace activist... The people in the audience stood up, setting off warm applause and cheers. Peace fighters embraced each other, and the stage and the audience became one. We happily spent the last minute of 1954 with the outstanding representatives of peace-loving people from all over the world, welcoming the arrival of 1955!

    Dr. Kitchlew, Chairman of the conference, said excitedly: "We all call the Chinese and Indian people brothers, yes, the Chinese and Indian people are brothers. No force in the world can break the long-standing friendship between our two countries. We spent 1954 peacefully, now we are stepping into 1955, and we will strive for 1955 to be a peaceful year too!"

    He solemnly spoke the hearts of hundreds of millions of people. The Chinese and Indian people demand mutual friendship, cooperation and peace, the Asian and African people demand mutual friendship, cooperation and peace, and the people of the world demand mutual friendship, cooperation and peace.

    The US aggressive bloc is creating division and confrontation in Asia, attempting to use all means to prepare for launching a new war of aggression. The threat of war is still before us. But as long as the Asian and world people unite, according to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, we can save peace, and we will surely achieve peace!

    和平——人民的愿望
    中华人民共和国访问印度文化代表团副团长　周而复
    当飞机临近印度首都德里机场的上空，我远远就看见了机场上一大片人群，挥动着手里的中国和印度的国旗，向中华人民共和国访问印度文化代表团的专机表示热烈欢迎。我们下了飞机。我的眼光马上给面前一片挥动的旗帜和飘扬的鲜花所包围了。一个花环又一个花环套到我们头上来，一直套到鼻子那儿，眼睛几乎要看不到面前的事物了，幸亏有人帮忙，把花环拿下来，才可以清楚看见拥在面前的人群；又是一个一个的花环，又要看不见了。欢迎者不断向我们撒着红玫瑰花瓣，一片片飘落下来，像大雨点似的。
    在红的、黄的、白的鲜花的包围中，在欢呼的包围中，我几乎分辨不出谁讲什么话，谁叫什么口号，但是有一个共同的声音，那就是：
    印中友好万岁！
    和平万岁！
    我们从中国带去中国政府和人民对印度政府和人民的友谊，我们的脚第一步踏上印度土地的时候，我们看到印度政府和人民对中国政府和人民的友谊和他们对和平的愿望。
    我们在印度每一个地方都看到发自人民内心的友谊。在几万人的广场上，在上千人的招待会上，在上百人的座谈会上，在少数人的交谈中，以至于在马路上，我们大家都不相识，但是大家都仿佛是老朋友。记得在德里的红堡，当我们走出放置孔雀王座的宫殿，发现一个印度中年男子，看上去不到五十岁，穿着一身白色的印度民族服装。他跟着我们走，嘴嗫嚅着，眼光老是热望地盯着我们，最后终于激动地走上来，握着我的手，说：
    “我是印度的一个普通人，我听说中华人民共和国文化代表团到达了新德里，我很希望能够看到你们，即使是一个代表团的团员也好，但我知道我是没有这个机会的。想不到在这儿碰见你们，这是我一生最大的荣幸与安慰。印中友好，和平万岁！”
    我们两人紧紧地握着手，很久很久谁也不放松。是的，他是一个普通的印度人。但他又不只是一个普通的印度人，他代表了千千万万的印度人民说出心中的话，我们到处看到这样的普通的印度人。有时候，我们甚至不必讲话，一个手势，一个眼神，一个微笑，大家都明白对方心里要讲的话。
    就说我们出席印中友好协会在德里甘地广场所举行的欢迎文化代表团大会吧。且不说欢迎会上激动的语句和热烈的掌声，也不提群众沸腾的热情，单讲散会走出广场那一段吧。我们从主席台旁边上汽车，要是平时步行到门口，最多也不要半分钟。但是我们的汽车至少开了十分钟光景。走道两边拥挤着人群：男的，女的，老的，少的，一只一只印度人民友谊的手伸进车厢里来，一边握着，一边讲：
    印中友好！
    毛泽东，金大巴（万岁）！
    和平万岁！
    有的就高声叫了起来。一只只友谊的手伸进车厢里来，几乎要把车厢的窗门塞满了。年青的孩子太矮，手伸不进来，大人把他抱起让他伸进来。汽车给人群堵塞得几乎不能前进了，由于主人的引导，好容易才慢慢开出，两边人群还不断投过来热烈的掌声和微笑的眼光。
    在阿旃陀，在孟买，在马德拉斯，在加尔各答，我们到处遇到同样的动人的情景。特别是在波保尔和贾尔冈车站。到波保尔车站是在十二月十四日深夜两点多钟，文化代表团的专车一进站，立刻被震动夜空的欢呼声包围了，文化代表团团长刚一下车，旋即被在车站已经等候了三个多小时的人群簇拥出去；简直不必用腿走路，欢腾的人群就把团员拥到事先布置好的主席台那儿去。天上繁星在闪耀，月台给火把灯光照得如同白昼一般。在灯光闪闪人影憧憧中走过来一位妇女，手里端着一盆灯火，举到我们团员头上，然后在团员面前绕了一个圆圈，用大拇指蘸了朱砂在额头当中向上一抹。这是印度人民最高贵的民族仪式，是母亲、姊妹送亲人远行或出征而祝福的仪式。
    在贾尔冈车站则是另外一个场景：车子一停，当地的负责人就来接洽，说是下面有个欢迎会请我们去参加。我们跟随他们走去，刚上了天桥，我们一露面，就听到轰轰的雷鸣一样的欢呼声，此起彼伏，压倒车站上一切的声音。等我们走下来，简直没法知道那儿有多少人，天桥上，月台上，车站门口广场，门外边，一直通向马路的远方，看不见尽头，都是人。马路上的人挤不下了，有人干脆就站在自己楼房的窗口，眼光远远对着车站月台，对着月台上的中华人民共和国的文化代表团。
    有人以为两个不同社会制度的国家不可以交朋友也不能够和平共处。是的，中国和印度两国的社会制度是不同的，但这并不能够妨碍我们之间的淳厚的友谊。我在印度将近两个月的愉快的旅行，许多地方许多人许多事实回答了这个问题。
    尼赫鲁总理的女儿英迪拉·甘地夫人说得好：
  “这两个亚洲伟大的国家，如此相似又是如此不同，两国之间的友谊的历史性的意义为周恩来总理访问印度和我们总理访问中国而重新照亮。从这些访问中所能看到的最重要的事实之一是我们两国自古以来的文化交往是如此密切，以致我们在对待政治和经济问题上的不同也不能阻隔我们。”孟买省首席法官贾格拉先生更进一步说：“有人以为和共产党国家交朋友是一种冒险，他不了解为什么聪明的人们竟会认真地这样设想，即似乎国与国之间的联系只可能是政治联系。中国有很多东西值得我们研究、了解、欣赏和学习。”他又说：“当我回想过去的历史、精神和宗教的联系将我们连结在一起；当我们想到最近的过去和现在，我们都曾遭受异族统治，而我们都曾为反对异族统治斗争过，今天都获得了自由。我们两国人民之间的友谊是坚强而完美的。我希望从这友谊中将产生团结、而因此发出保卫和平的力量。”
    全印和平理事会主席克其鲁博士说得更透彻：“三年前，我们开展宣传和平共处的高贵原则时，很多人为有利益关系的人所欺骗，把和平共处这样美丽的字眼说成是‘邪恶’‘危险’和‘颠覆性’。但是今天，这几个字已深入世界各族人民的心；只有如麦卡锡议员之流才会公然宣布说从和平共处中发现什么‘邪恶’、‘危险’和‘颠覆性’的因素。”
      一位自命为“有良心的民主主义者和自由世界的好公民”的印度人说：他一向逃避共产党，但从来没有看到一个肉体的共产党人。这次在孟买电影界欢迎中华人民共和国文化代表团的盛大集会上他看到了文化代表团，看到了共产党也是普通的人，是普通的有礼貌，会说会笑，有感情的男人和女人。在这个场合，当群众高呼兄弟姊妹时，他们是以真正的兄弟姊妹看待的。再有几个这样的文化代表团来访问亚洲国家吧，上帝救救这个自由世界。
    从这位自命为“有良心的民主主义者和自由世界的好公民”的声音里，我们可以看出美国华尔街的老板们如何摧残了普通人民的精神，使一些人丧失了对事物正常的客观的看法。即使如此，当他面对事实，也不得不改变他的态度，恢复他正常的看法，希望和中国往来，希望和中国友好。
    中印人民的友谊不是从今天才开始的，有它悠久的历史。最近数年来的事实证明了中印两国总理所倡导的和平共处五项原则不是一个理想，而是可以在世界各国之间实现的崇高的原则。中国和印度近十亿人民的友谊，是维护亚洲和世界和平的重大力量。
    十二月十四日的晚上，我们从阿格拉到了瓜洛尔，在月台的灯光下，挤满了欢迎的人群。车子开进站，开了车门，下车门的路给蜂拥上来的欢迎的人群堵塞住了。我们下不了车，就在车门口和欢迎的人群见面。在拥挤的人群中，我发现有一位老太太，穿着镶着红边的深灰色的沙里，她怀里抱着一个看上去不到两岁的孩子，用力向我们面前挤来。欢迎的人群慢慢给她让出一条只容她一个人走过的路来。她好不容易气喘喘地挤到窗口，从她怀里掏出一面旗子，向车门递上来。我们接过来，打开一看，是一面淡青色的绸子的旗子，上面用白线绣了一个飞翔着的和平鸽。欢迎的人群都看到这面旗子，顿时爆裂开掌声。她那对充满了慈祥和智慧的大而深的眼睛，紧紧地望着我们。我们从她的眼光里看出她所要说的话：要求和平，要求中印友好！
    在派泼苏车站我们又收到派泼苏和平委员会一面非常有意义的旗子，是浅灰色的，中间绣了一个白鸽，左边是绿、白、黄三色印度国旗，右边是中华人民共和国的国旗。这还用说明吗？旗子本身就是最好的有力的语言：印中友好！保卫和平！
    我们收到无数这样的旗子。我们虽然不懂印度各地的语言，印度各地人民也不懂中国语言，但是我们之间绝对感觉不到有语言上的隔膜、语言的困难也不能阻隔我们之间思想的表达和感情的交流。
    在马德拉斯，在一九五四年的最后一天的夜晚，我们文化代表团的同志出席了全印争取和平和亚洲团结大会在库马拉达女子艺术高等学校所举行的新年联欢晚会，当印度著名喜剧演员克里希南在台上宣布一九五四年最后几分钟就要过去，一九五五年即将到来的庄严的时刻，我们文化代表团的同志和出席全印争取和平和亚洲团结大会的世界上杰出的和平战士们一道走上主席台。这里面有世界和平理事会副主席贝尔纳教授，世界和平理事会总书记拉斐德先生，瑞典和平人士安德琳博士，澳大利亚和平人士斯崔特夫人……全场的人都站起来了，掀起热烈的掌声和欢呼声。和平战士们互相拥抱，台上台下连成一片。我们和世界上各国爱好和平人民的优秀代表愉快地度过了一九五四年的最后一分钟，迎接一九五五年的来临！
    大会主席克其鲁博士兴奋地说：“我们都喊印中人民是兄弟，是的，印中人民是兄弟。世界上没有任何力量可以拆散我们两国悠久的友谊。我们和平度过一九五四年，现在我们跨进一九五五年，我们争取一九五五年也是和平的一年！”
    他庄严地说出亿万人民的心声。中印人民要求互相友好合作和和平，亚非人民要求互相友好合作和和平，世界人民要求互相友好合作和和平。
    美国侵略集团在亚洲制造分裂和对立，企图用一切手段来准备发动新的侵略战争。战争的威胁仍然在我们面前。但只要亚洲和世界人民团结起来，根据和平共处的五项原则，我们可以拯救和平，而且一定可以取得和平！
