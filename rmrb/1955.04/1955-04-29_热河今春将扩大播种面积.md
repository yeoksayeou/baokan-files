Jehol Province will increase cultivated land and expand the sown area by more than 439,000 mu this spring.

Fully utilizing land is one of the important measures for increasing production in Jehol Province this year. When counties and banners held the second meeting of the first People's Congress, they all seriously discussed this issue and formulated plans to fully utilize existing land and increase cultivated land to expand the sown area based on local conditions.

Currently, more than 12,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province have first opened up land boundaries and reduced or eliminated unnecessary small paths in the fields. According to estimates by provincial leading organs, each cooperative can increase the sown area by at least three mu. From this item alone, the province will increase the sown area by more than 36,000 mu.

Agricultural producers' cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and the broad masses of peasants in various places are also increasing cultivated land and expanding sown areas by opening up edges and corners, removing stones from the fields, building terraced fields, and reclaiming wasteland along rivers. More than 900 agricultural producers' cooperatives in Chengde County can increase the sown area by more than 5,800 mu by using these methods. (Xinhua News Agency)

    热河今春将扩大播种面积
    热河省今春将增加耕地扩大播种面积四十三万九千多亩。
    充分利用土地，是热河省今年的重要增产措施之一。各县、旗在召开第一届人民代表大会第二次会议时，都对这一问题认真地进行了讨论，并根据当地条件制定了充分利用现有土地、增加耕地扩大播种面积的计划。
    现在，全省一万二千多个农业生产合作社，都首先打开地界、减少或取消地里不必要的小道。据省领导机关估计：每个社至少可增加播种面积三亩，从这一项，全省就增加播种面积三万六千多亩。
    各地农业生产合作社、互助组和广大农民，还从开边展沿、起出地里的石块、修梯田、开河荒等方面，来增加耕地扩大播种面积。承德县九百多个农业生产合作社运用这些办法就可以增加播种面积五千八百多亩。　　　（新华社）
