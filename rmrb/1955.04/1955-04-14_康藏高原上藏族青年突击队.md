On the Danba Mica Mine in Xikang Province, the first Tibetan Youth Shock Brigade on the Kangzang Plateau has emerged. It is composed of twenty-three Tibetan youths, including sixteen Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. The shock brigade members work hard to learn technology, unite and help each other, and have created an excellent record in labor productivity for the entire mine. For example, in transporting waste ore, the shock brigade's efficiency is more than twice as high as usual, and in drilling blastholes, it is more than 30 percent higher.

In 1954, not long after the shock brigade was established, it completed the overhaul work on the mining site, which originally required fifteen days, in just over four days. Three months ago, the shock brigade requested to work on the top of the high mountain with the richest mineral deposits, more than 4,000 meters above sea level. At that time, the mountain was covered with snow, the air was thin, and strong winds and hailstorms were unpredictable. Many people's faces and hands were frostbitten. They adjusted the labor organization, promoted the Soviet "deep-hole blasting method," and completed more than 115 percent of the plan. Now, many young people are striving to become members of the shock brigade. (Xinhua News Agency)

    康藏高原上藏族青年突击队
    在西康省丹巴云母矿上出现了康藏高原上的第一支藏族青年突击队。它由二十三个藏族青年组成，其中有十六名共产党员和青年团员。突击队员努力学习技术、团结互助，在劳动生产率方面创造了全矿优异的纪录。例如运输废矿石，突击队的工效比一般高一倍多，打炮眼高百分之三十多。
    一九五四年突击队刚成立不久，就曾以四天多的时间完成了采矿工地原来需要十五天的检修工作。在三个月前，突击队曾请求在矿产最富的拔海四千多公尺的高顶山上工作。当时山上到处是积雪、空气稀薄，狂风、冰雹变幻莫测，许多人的脸、手都冻裂了。他们调整了劳动组织，推广了苏联“深坑爆破法”，完成计划百分之一百一十五多。现在许多青年正在争取成为突击队员。 （新华社）
