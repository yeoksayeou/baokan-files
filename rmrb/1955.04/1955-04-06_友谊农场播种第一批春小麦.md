    Friendship Farm Sows First Batch of Spring Wheat
    On April 4th, tractor drivers at the state-owned Friendship Farm used machinery donated by the Soviet Union to sow the first batch of spring wheat seeds on newly reclaimed virgin land on the Sandaogang Grassland.
    The newly cultivated land for this sowing totals 2,000 hectares, which was plowed by the former Sandaogang Farm last autumn and later placed under the management of the Fourth and Fifth Sub-farms of the Friendship Farm. The original plowing quality of this newly cultivated land was poor, and the Friendship Farm carried out continuous land preparation work on this land before spring sowing. Tractor drivers also carefully inspected each component of the seed drill under the personal guidance and assistance of Soviet experts. Each tractor team also carefully discussed and studied methods to improve sowing quality.
    On the morning of the 4th, the Fourth and Fifth Sub-farms began sowing simultaneously. Each Det-54 tractor pulled three 48-row seed drills, moving in an orderly, crisscrossing pattern. This spring wheat sowing is a trial of the advanced cross-sowing method with a row spacing of 7.5 centimeters. The advantages of this new sowing method are: to evenly distribute each grain of wheat on each centimeter of land, so that each wheat seedling can fully and evenly absorb nutrients and sunlight, thereby making fuller use of the land and increasing yield.

    友谊农场播种第一批春小麦
    四月四日这天，国营友谊农场的拖拉机手们用苏联赠送的机器，在三道岗草原新开垦的处女地上播下了第一批春小麦种籽。
    这次播种的新垦荒地共计两千公顷，是前三道岗农场在去年秋天翻耕起来的，后划归友谊农场的第四、五分场经营。这块新垦荒地原来翻耕的质量较差，春播前友谊农场又在这块土地上连续进行了整地工作。拖拉机手们还在苏联专家的亲自指导和帮助下，仔细地检验了播种机的每个部件。各拖拉机包车组还认真讨论和研究如何提高播种质量的办法。
    四日上午，第四、五分场同时开始播种。每台德特五四式拖拉机牵引着三台四十八行播种机，有秩序地交叉行驶。这次春小麦的播种是试用先进的七点五公分行距的交叉播种法。这一新播种法的优点是：把每棵麦粒均匀地分布在每公分土地上，使每棵麦苗能充分而均匀地吸收养分和阳光，从而更充分地利用土地，提高产量。
