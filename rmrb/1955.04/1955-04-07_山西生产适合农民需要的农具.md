Since the beginning of spring, handicraft production cooperatives in Shanxi Province have produced a large number of various farm tools suitable for farmers' needs.

Before producing these farm tools, some municipal and county Party committees held production-sales combination meetings. At the meetings, handicraft production cooperatives exhibited their products and sent technical personnel to introduce the specifications, quality, uses, and prices of various farm tools to representatives of grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives, soliciting their opinions. Some handicraft production cooperatives sent business personnel to directly investigate and collect opinions in rural areas with product samples. After the preparatory committee of the Hongzhao County Handicraft Production Cooperative Union conducted a typical survey in the Wusiyi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shiqiao Village, it revised the production plan based on the opinions of 117 farmers. After learning that farmers had pointed out shortcomings such as the small size of manure scoops, uneven ploughshare blades, and short rake teeth produced by the Liugou Foundry Production Cooperative in Wuxiang County, the cooperative immediately improved these products and was warmly welcomed by the masses. Contracts signed on this basis can meet production requirements. According to incomplete statistics from two cities and nine counties in the province, 1,142 raw material supply and product sales contracts have been signed between handicraft production cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and agricultural production cooperatives, ordering 645,489 various large and small farm tools. The contracts also stipulate that these farm tools will be supplied to rural areas successively before spring plowing. As of mid-March, according to incomplete statistics from seventeen cities and counties including Changzhi City, Yuci, Linyi, Taigu, Dingxiang, Linfen, Linxian, and Qi County, handicraft production organizations have supplied farmers with 210,669 various large and small farm tools and repaired 10,100 various farm tools for farmers.

    山西生产适合农民需要的农具
    入春以来，山西省的手工业生产合作组织已为农民生产了大批适合农民需要的各种农具。
    在生产这批农具之前，有的市县党委曾召开产销结合会议，由手工业生产合作社在会上展览自己的产品，并派熟悉技术的人向基层供销合作社和农业生产合作社的代表们详细地介绍了各种农具的规格、质量、用途和价钱，征求意见。有些手工业生产合作社派业务员携带产品样式直接深入农村搜集意见。洪赵县手工业生产合作社联合社筹委会派人到石桥村五四一农业生产合作社进行典型调查后，根据一一七户农民提出的意见修定了生产计划。武乡县柳沟翻砂生产合作社了解到农民提出该社生产的粪杓小，犁铧铲头不平，耙齿短等缺点以后，立即改进这几种产品，受到群众热烈欢迎。在这种基础上签订的合同，便能适合生产的要求。据全省两个市九个县的不完全统计，手工业生产合作社、供销合作社、农业生产合作社之间已签订原料供应和产品推销合同一千一百四十二份，订了各种大小农具六十四万五千四百八十九件，合同并规定这些农具到春耕前陆续供应农村。截至三月中旬止，仅据长治市、榆次、临猗、太谷、定襄、临汾、临县、祁县等十七个市县的不完全统计，手工业生产合作组织已供应农民各种大小农具二十一万零六百六十九件，并替农民修理了各种农具一万零一百件。
