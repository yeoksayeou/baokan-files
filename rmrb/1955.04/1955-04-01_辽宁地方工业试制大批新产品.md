Liaoning Local Industry Trial-Produces Large Numbers of New Products

Local state-owned industries in Liaoning Province have trial-produced 1,042 new products. Among these new products, those needed to support key projects include the "automatic recording film signal meter" and "automatic recording film flow meter" trial-produced by the Lüda Metrology Instrument Factory for Anshan Iron and Steel. For the needs of urban and rural people's lives, there are "patterned socks" trial-produced by the Liaoyang Cotton Weaving Factory, men's scarves and women's headscarves trial-produced by the Liaoning Tussah Silk Company Experimental Factory, and children's harmonicas and pianos trial-produced by the Yingkou Musical Instrument Factory. There are also new products trial-produced for basic construction, such as particleboard trial-produced by the Liaoning Match Factory and acid-resistant ash trial-produced by the Lüda Kiln and Mine General Factory. In addition, many new farm tools have been trial-produced for farmers.
