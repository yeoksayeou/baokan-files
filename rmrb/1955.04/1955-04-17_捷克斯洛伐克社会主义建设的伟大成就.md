I warmly welcome and congratulate the opening of the Exhibition of Achievements in Ten Years of Socialist Construction in Czechoslovakia in our capital, Beijing. This exhibition is an epitome of the socialist construction undertaken by the Czechoslovak people under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and government, and an important manifestation of support for our country's socialist construction. It will demonstrate the rapid progress of Czechoslovakia's industrial and agricultural economy, the rapid development of science and technology, the prosperity of culture, art, and education, and the happiness of the Czechoslovak people's lives. It will also demonstrate the rapid growth and strength of the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union. It will also greatly inspire our country's socialist construction.

When I went to Czechoslovakia in 1954, I personally witnessed the great achievements of the Czechoslovak people in restoring and developing the national economy, and the various creative deeds and patriotic enthusiasm shown by the Czechoslovak working class in completing the glorious work of the national plan. At the same time, I also saw the enthusiasm and achievements of the Czechoslovak people in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1953, Czechoslovakia had successfully completed the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy (1949-1953). Due to the successful completion of the five-year plan, the industrial level exceeded more than twice the level reached by the domestic capitalist era in nearly one hundred and fifty years, labor productivity increased by 60%, and the amount of industrial products obtained by each resident increased by 147% compared with the pre-war period. Among them, the development of heavy industry was faster, increasing by 118.7%. Its proportion in the total industrial output value increased from 57.6% to 62.3%. The production of machinery increased 2.3 times. In 1948, the output value of machinery manufacturing accounted for 16% of the total industrial output value. Now it is close to one-third. Steel production has reached 4.4 million tons, twice that of 1937. Coal production was 54.7 million tons, exceeding the 34.7 million tons in 1937 by nearly 60%. Electricity was 12.4 billion kilowatt-hours, equal to three times that of 1937. Compared with 1948, the production of ferroalloys increased by 2.8 times. The production of the chemical industry increased one and a half times. During the same period, agriculture and consumer goods also achieved further development accordingly. The production of consumer goods increased by 79.8%. Oil crops increased by 79%, and flax by 154%. The proportion of cultivated land in agricultural cooperatives in the country's cultivated land has increased from 3% to 44%. The working area of ​​machine tractor stations increased from 753,000 hectares in 1949 to 6.68 million hectares in 1953, an increase of nearly eight times. Animal husbandry production has increased to 40% of the total agricultural output value of Czechoslovakia.

Czechoslovakia's industry has not only experienced a leap in quantity, but also has been continuously improved in technology and has a considerable degree of integrity. There are also many types of products, with a relatively high quality level. We visited the modern Gottwald Steel Plant, which was newly built during the first five-year plan. It was built with Czechoslovakia's own design and equipment. The degree of mechanization and automation is very high. In addition, we also saw that Czechoslovakia can smelt various special alloy steels. In terms of heavy machinery manufacturing, there are large boring machines with a boring bar diameter of 300 mm, and large vertical lathes that can turn workpieces with a diameter of 18 meters. They can manufacture 12,000-ton large hydraulic presses, large earth-moving machines, bucket excavators, rolling mills, 50,000-kilowatt steam turbine generators, steam boilers, hydrogen-cooled 50,000-kilowatt generators, as well as various chemical equipment and machine tools. More than one-third of the machine tools manufactured are automatic and semi-automatic. Other industrial products such as industrial instruments, precision tool gauges, precision measuring blocks and other precision machinery, as well as transportation vehicles such as automobiles, telecommunications equipment, and various specialized machines, can generally be manufactured. In addition to basically meeting the needs of Czechoslovakia, it can also supply the needs of fraternal countries.

Complete manual coal mining is no longer seen in Czechoslovakia. The coal mining industry has basically implemented mechanization and electrification. In the stripping and coal mining of open-pit mines, in addition to using heavy-duty electric shovels of 2.5 or 7 cubic meters, they also use rotary six-bucket excavators with a production capacity of 1,000 cubic meters per hour, and each unit can replace 3,500 people. There are also multi-bucket, multi-wheel electric shovels that can dig 23 meters upwards and 28 meters downwards, with a production capacity of 1,000 cubic meters per hour. With the increase in excavation volume, the work of waste soil accumulation has become more difficult, so they also use an earth-moving machine with a production capacity of 2,900 cubic meters per hour, which can quickly pile the soil into small hills 30 meters high.

The development of Czechoslovakia's industry has now exceeded the industrial level of certain capitalist countries. For example, calculated per capita, Czechoslovakia's power generation has exceeded that of France and Italy, and steel production has exceeded that of the United Kingdom and France.

The socialist component in Czechoslovakia's national economy has become a decisive factor in all sectors of the national economy. During the five-year plan, the socialist component in the national economy increased from 61% to 92% (excluding agriculture). In industry, the socialist component accounts for 99.6%. Ninety-seven percent of cities and villages have been electrified.

After liberation, Czechoslovakia has made tremendous achievements in industrial construction, agricultural transformation, and improvement of people's lives. As stated in the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Tenth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party: "These achievements have laid a solid foundation for the Czechoslovak people to build socialism, guaranteed the economic prosperity and further upsurge of culture of the Czechoslovak people, and strengthened the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union." As Czechoslovak Prime Minister Široký said in the National Assembly report: "The main result of the construction and transformation of the first five-year plan is that Czechoslovakia's national economy, especially industrial production, has created the foundation for the independence and autonomy of the Czechoslovak Republic today, and created an unshakable foundation for the security of our country's economic strength and national defense."

With the rapid development of national economic construction, the living standards of the Czechoslovak people have also greatly improved. During the five-year plan period, the national income increased by 59%, and several price reductions were implemented at the same time. The prices of certain industrial products and electricity bills are much lower than before the war. Last year, the electricity bill per degree was 70.4% lower than in 1937, and the average rent in Prague was only a quarter of what it was before the war. The number of nurseries has more than tripled, and many new kindergartens have been established. The infant mortality rate has decreased by 62% compared with 1937. These achievements have brought great happiness to the Czechoslovak people and encouraged them to move forward in new labor endeavors. In July 1954, I participated in the second meeting of the Sino-Czech Joint Committee for Scientific and Technological Cooperation held in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, and personally experienced the sincere help and enthusiastic support of the Czechoslovak comrades. All the work in the meeting went smoothly. They attached great importance to the questions raised by the Chinese comrades, and also organized experts from various fields to meet our requirements as much as possible. They not only enthusiastically and proactively introduced Czechoslovakia's industrial situation, but also considerated the interests of our country's economic construction from our perspective.

During our visit to Czechoslovakia, we heard a very cordial voice everywhere: "Although the distance between our two countries is far, our hearts are connected, because the people of our two countries are fighting together for the lofty cause of democracy and peace for mankind. Your victory is our victory." At the same time, the Czechoslovak government and people provided us with assistance and convenience in all aspects. Wherever we went, we were warmly welcomed and received. We were treated like close brothers by the Czechoslovak people. The responsible comrades and staff comrades of various factories and enterprises regarded our visit as their honor, proactively introduced us to the production situation, and patiently answered questions, so that we learned a lot of valuable things during the visit. At the same time, we also deeply felt the high internationalist spirit of the Czechoslovak comrades.

This exhibition of achievements in ten years of socialist construction in Czechoslovakia is being held in our capital, comprehensively and in detail introducing the achievements of Czechoslovakia's economic and cultural construction to our people. This is not only a good opportunity for us to learn, but also will further promote the consolidation and development of the great friendship between the Chinese and Czech people.

    捷克斯洛伐克社会主义建设的伟大成就
    第三机械工业部部长　张霖之
    我以热烈的心情欢迎和祝贺捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会在我国首都北京举行。这个展览会是捷克斯洛伐克人民在捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府领导下进行社会主义建设的缩影，是支援我国社会主义建设事业的一种重要表现。它将显示出捷克斯洛伐克工农业经济的突飞猛进，科学技术的迅速发展，文化艺术和教育事业的繁荣以及捷克斯洛伐克人民生活的幸福。也将显示出以苏联为首的世界和平阵营力量的迅速增长和强大。它也将给我国的社会主义建设事业以很大的鼓舞。
      一九五四年我到捷克斯洛伐克的时候，亲眼看到捷克斯洛伐克人民恢复和发展国民经济中的巨大成就，捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级在完成国家计划的光荣劳动中所表现的各种创造事迹和爱国热情。同时还看到捷克斯洛伐克人民在学习苏联先进经验中所表现的热诚和成就。一九五三年底捷克斯洛伐克已经胜利地完成了发展国民经济的第一个五年计划（一九四九年至一九五三年）。由于五年计划的胜利完成，工业水平超过了本国资本主义时代将近一百五十年所达到的水平一倍以上，劳动生产率提高了百分之六十，按人口计算，每个居民所获得的工业品较战前增加了百分之一百四十七，其中重工业的发展更快，增加了百分之一百一十八点七。它在工业总产值中所占比重，由百分之五十七点六增加到百分之六十二点三。机器的生产增加了二点三倍，在一九四八年时机器制造业产值为全工业产值的百分之十六。到现在已接近三分之一。钢的产量已达四百四十万吨，为一九三七年的二倍。煤的产量五千四百七十万吨，超过一九三七年三千四百七十万吨近百分之六十。电力一百二十四亿瓩时，等于一九三七年的三倍。与一九四八年相比，铁合金的生产增加了二点八倍。化学工业的生产增加一倍半。在同一时期中农业和消费品也相应地获得了进一步的发展。消费品的生产增加了百分之七十九点八。油料作物增加了百分之七十九，亚麻百分之一百五十四。农业合作社耕地在全国耕地中所占的比重已从百分之三增加到百分之四十四。机器拖拉机站的工作面积从一九四九年的七十五万三千公顷增加到一九五三年的六百六十八万公顷，将近增加八倍。畜牧业生产已增加到捷克斯洛伐克农业总产值百分之四十。
    捷克斯洛伐克的工业不但在数量上有飞跃的增长，而且技术方面也在不断地提高，且具有相当高度的完整性。产品种类也很多，有相当高的质量水平。我们参观了在第一个五年计划中新建的现代化的哥特瓦尔德钢铁厂，它是以捷克斯洛伐克自己的设计和装备建设起来的。机械化和自动化的程度很高。此外，还看到捷克斯洛伐克能冶炼各种特种合金钢。在重型机械制造方面，有镗杆直径三百公厘的大镗床，有可以车十八公尺直径工作物的大立式车床等，能够制造一万二千吨的大型水压机、大型移土机、多斗式掘土机、压延机、五万瓩的蒸气透平机、蒸气锅炉、氢气冷却式的五万瓩发电机以及各种化工设备和工作母机等。在制造的工作母机中有三分之一以上是自动和半自动的。其他工业品如工业仪器、精密工具量具、精测块规等精密机械以及汽车等交通工具，电讯器材和各种专业机器，一般都能制造。除基本上满足了捷克斯洛伐克的需要外，并能供应兄弟国家的需要。
    捷克斯洛伐克现在已经看不到完全用人力采煤的现象了，采煤工业基本上实行了机械化和电气化。他们在露天矿的剥离和采煤方面，除用二点五或七立方公尺的重型电铲外，还使用着转动式六斗掘土机，生产能力每小时一千立方公尺，每台可代替三千五百人操作。另有多斗多轮式的电铲，可以向上掘二十三公尺，向下掘二十八公尺，每小时生产能力为一千立方公尺。随着掘土量的增加，废土的堆积工作更加繁重，因此他们又使用了一种每小时生产能力为二千九百立方公尺的移土机，它可以很快地将土堆成三十公尺高的小山。
    捷克斯洛伐克工业的发展现在已超过某些资本主义国家工业的水平，如按人口平均计算，捷克斯洛伐克的发电量已超过了法国和意大利，钢的产量已经超过了英国和法国。
    捷克斯洛伐克国民经济中的社会主义成分，已成为国民经济各部门中决定性的因素。在五年计划中，国民经济中的社会主义成分已从百分之六十一增加到百分之九十二（农业除外）。在工业中，社会主义成分占百分之九十九点六。百分之九十七的城市和乡村已经电气化了。
    捷克斯洛伐克解放后在工业建设、改造农业、改善人民生活等方面取得了巨大的成就。正如中国共产党中央委员会致捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会的贺词中所说：“这些成就，奠定了捷克斯洛伐克人民建设社会主义的稳固基础，保证了捷克斯洛伐克人民经济的繁荣和文化的进一步高涨，增强了以苏联为首的世界和平阵营”。也正如捷克斯洛伐克西罗基总理在国民议会的报告中所说的：“第一个五年计划的建设和改造的主要结果，就是使捷克斯洛伐克的国民经济，特别是工业生产，创造了今天捷克斯洛伐克共和国独立自主的基础，创造了我国经济实力和国防力量安全不可动摇的基础。”
    随着国家经济建设的飞速发展，捷克斯洛伐克人民的生活水平也有了很大的提高。在五年计划期间，国民收入增加了百分之五十九，同时实行了数次减低物价。某些工业品的价格和电费等都比战前低得很多。去年每一度的电费比一九三七年降低了百分之七十点四，布拉格的房租平均不过等于战前的四分之一。托儿所增加了三倍还多，许多新的幼儿园建立起来了，婴儿的死亡率比一九三七年降低了百分之六十二。这些成就带给捷克斯洛伐克人民莫大的幸福，鼓舞着他们在新的劳动事业中迈进。一九五四年七月间我参加了在捷克斯洛伐克首都布拉格召开的中捷科学与技术合作联合委员会第二届会议，亲身体会到捷克斯洛伐克同志们对我们的诚恳帮助和热情支援。会议中的各项工作进行得很顺利。他们对中国同志所提的问题非常重视，并且还组织了各方面的专家尽可能地满足我们的要求。他们不仅热心地主动地介绍捷克斯洛伐克工业情况，而且设身处地地考虑到我国经济建设的利益。
    我们在捷克斯洛伐克参观的时期中，到处听到一种非常亲切的声音：“我们两个国家的距离虽然较远，但我们的心是连在一起的，因为我们两国的人民都在为着人类的崇高的民主和平事业而共同奋斗。你们的胜利就是我们的胜利。”同时，捷克斯洛伐克政府和人民在各方面给我们以协助和便利。每到一个地方，我们都受到热烈的欢迎和招待。我们被当作捷克斯洛伐克人民的亲兄弟般看待。各个工厂企业的负责同志和职工同志们，都把我们的访问认为是他们的光荣，主动地向我们介绍生产情况，耐心地解答问题，使我们在参观中学到很多宝贵的东西。同时也深深地感受到捷克斯洛伐克同志的高度的国际主义精神。
    这次捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会在我国首都举行，全面地详尽地把捷克斯洛伐克经济和文化建设的成就介绍给我国人民。这不仅是我们学习的一个好机会，而且将更进一步地促进中捷两国人民伟大友谊的巩固和发展。
