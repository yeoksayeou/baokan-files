    Tenth Anniversary of the Sino-Polish Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Cooperation
    Chen Zhuo
    Today is the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Postwar Cooperation between the Soviet Union and Poland. This treaty, signed in Moscow on April 21, 1945, is a document of great significance. It legally solidified the friendship cemented in blood between the Soviet and Polish peoples in their common struggle against Fascist Germany, and laid the foundation for friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and Poland after the war.
    In the long period before the war, due to the anti-Soviet policy pursued by the old Polish ruling class, Poland was used by imperialism as a vanguard and springboard for attacking the Soviet Union, and the Polish people suffered major disasters as a result of the war. The signing of the Sino-Polish Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Postwar Cooperation fundamentally changed the relationship between the Soviet Union and Poland, and blocked the path for imperialism to use Poland as a tool to oppose the Soviet Union and provoke war.
    At the time of the signing of the Sino-Polish Treaty, Stalin pointed out, "This treaty is the cornerstone for guaranteeing the independence of a new democratic Poland and guaranteeing Poland's strength and prosperity." Facts have fully proven this to be the case. Ten years later today, everyone can clearly see how important it is to form a friendly alliance with the great socialist country of the Soviet Union in order to guarantee Poland's independence and promote the rapid development of Poland's economy.
    With the help of the Soviet Union, Poland rapidly restored its national economy, which had been severely damaged by the war, and greatly developed its own industry. Over the years, the Soviet Union has supplied Poland with complete sets of equipment for 60 large projects, including huge projects such as the Lenin Iron and Steel Union Enterprise in Nowa Huta, which can produce more than 1.5 million tons of steel per year. Many new industrial enterprises and industrial products in Poland are constructed and produced based on the designs and technical documents supplied by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union also supplies Poland with many important industrial raw materials. For example, cotton imported from the Soviet Union meets 80 to 90 percent of the needs of the Polish textile industry. The speed of Poland's socialist industrialization is amazing. It has achieved extremely great results in just ten years. Now Poland's total industrial output value has exceeded three times that of pre-war levels, and its steel production has even surpassed Italy and caught up with France. This speed of development and achievement is inseparable from Soviet assistance.
    The era of imperialist countries arbitrarily controlling and slaughtering Poland is gone forever. Today's Poland has become an independent and strong country in Europe. It not only has the strength to safeguard its sovereign independence, but is also making important contributions to the cause of peace. Poland's participation in supervising the armistice in Korea and India is a vivid example. Poland's prosperity and the friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and Poland have become an important factor in stabilizing European peace. Poland's international prestige is growing day by day. Today, when Western countries have ratified the Paris Agreement, thus increasing the threat of a new war, the Sino-Polish Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Postwar Cooperation is even more important. The Soviet Union, Poland and other people's democratic countries will never allow themselves to be caught off guard in the face of the development of the situation caused by imperialist aggression.
    The Sino-Polish Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Postwar Cooperation is an important contribution to the cause of maintaining peace, and also a good example of promoting international friendly and cooperative relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

    苏波友好、互助与战后合作条约签订十周年
    陈卓
    今天是苏联同波兰签订友好、互助与战后合作条约的十周年纪念日。一九四五年四月二十一日在莫斯科签订的这个条约，是一个具有重大意义的文件。它用法律的形式把苏波两国人民在反对法西斯德国的共同斗争中用鲜血凝成的友谊固定下来，并且奠定了苏波两国战后友好合作的基础。
    在战前的长时期中，由于旧波兰统治阶级奉行反苏政策，波兰被帝国主义利用来作为进攻苏联的先锋和跳板，波兰人民因此而遭受到战争的重大灾难。苏波友好、互助与战后合作条约的签订，根本改变了苏波两国之间的关系，并且堵塞了帝国主义利用波兰作为反对苏联和挑拨战争的工具的道路。
    在苏波条约签订的时候，斯大林曾经指出，
  “这个条约是保障新的民主的波兰独立，保障波兰强盛繁荣的柱石”。事实完全证明了是这样的。在十年以后的今天，每一个人都可以很清楚地看到，同伟大的社会主义国家苏联结成友好的联盟，对于保障波兰的独立和促进波兰经济的迅速发展有着多么重大的意义。
    在苏联的帮助下，波兰迅速地恢复了被战争严重破坏的国民经济，大大地发展了自己的工业。这些年来，苏联供应给波兰六十项大工程的全套设备，其中包括像诺瓦胡塔的列宁冶金联合企业那样能够年产一百五十万吨以上的钢的巨大工程。波兰的许多新的工业企业和工业产品是根据苏联所供给的设计和技术文件来建筑和生产的。苏联还供应给波兰许多重要的工业原料。例如，从苏联入口的棉花，满足了波兰纺织业所需的百分之八十到九十。波兰的社会主义工业化的速度是惊人的。它在短短的十年中已获得了极其巨大的成果。现在波兰的工业生产总值已超过战前的三倍以上，钢的生产量甚至已超过意大利并赶上法国了。这种发展速度和成就是同苏联的援助分不开的。
    帝国主义国家任意支配和宰割波兰的时代是一去不复返了。今天的波兰已成为欧洲的一个独立强盛的国家。它不仅有力量维护自己的主权独立，而且正在对和平事业作出重要的贡献。波兰在朝鲜和印度参加监督停战，就是生动的例子。波兰的兴盛和苏波两国的友好合作，已成为稳定欧洲和平的重要因素。波兰的国际威信正在日益增长。在西方国家批准巴黎协定因而增加了新战争威胁的今天，苏波友好、互助与战后合作条约就更加显得重要。苏联、波兰同其他人民民主国家在由于帝国主义的侵略活动而造成的事态发展的面前，是决不会使自己处于措手不及的地位的。
    苏波友好、互助与战后合作条约对维护和平事业是一个重要的贡献，也是在平等互利基础上推进国际友好合作关系的一个良好范例。
