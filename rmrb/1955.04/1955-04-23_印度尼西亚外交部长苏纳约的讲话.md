    Speech by Indonesian Foreign Minister Sunario
    Your Excellency, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:

    First of all, on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Indonesia, I express my joy that our government and your government have reached an agreement on resolving the issue of dual nationality existing between our two countries.

    The signing of this treaty just now is a very important event, not only for our country and our people, but also for your country and your people.

    Doesn't this treaty have the potential to eliminate a situation that has existed for decades and that we now consider to be out of step with the times?

    Our government is also honored that this treaty is being concluded during the Asian-African Conference, which is a historic event in the relations between Asian and African countries.

    The negotiations were conducted in a friendly atmosphere. We hope that this situation will forever exist and develop between the Republic of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China.

    印度尼西亚外交部长苏纳约的讲话
    中华人民共和国外交部长阁下：
    首先，我代表印度尼西亚共和国政府表示庆幸我国政府与贵国政府对于解决存在于我们两国间的双重国籍问题已达成协议。
    刚才，本条约的签字是一件很重要的事件，这不仅对我国和我国的人民是一件重要的事情，同样地，对贵国和贵国人民也是一件重要的事情。
    难道本条约不是有可能消除那存在了数十年，而现在已被我们认为已不适时的情况吗？
    我国政府也感到荣幸，因为这次的缔约正当亚非会议期间，这是亚非国家间关系上的历史事件。
    这次谈判是在友好的气氛中进行的。希望这种情形永远地存在于印度尼西亚共和国和中华人民共和国之间，并日益发展。
