　　Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 7th. After Chiang Kai-shek's air force second lieutenant pilot Luo Muwen was captured, he received lenient treatment from the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

　　On the morning of April 3rd, when Luo Muwen was piloting a F-47 type 318 aircraft to harass Jinjiang County and was shot down by our army and parachuted to the ground, he was captured alive by our army on the spot. At that time, he was scantily clad, shivering from the cold and fear. The People's Liberation Army soldiers immediately took off their own coats and put them on him, and explained to him the policy of the People's Liberation Army to treat prisoners leniently. Then, they took him to a temporary resting place, applied medicine to the places he had scratched during the parachute jump, and gave him food. The next day, the People's Liberation Army also issued him new casual clothes, towels, toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, and pocket money. Luo Muwen said excitedly: "I never thought that I would receive such lenient treatment from the People's Liberation Army after being captured. These facts fully prove that Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda that 'being captured is a dead end' is a complete lie."

    蒋贼飞行员罗穆文被俘后
    受到人民解放军的宽大待遇
　　新华社福建前线七日电　蒋贼空军少尉飞行员罗穆文被俘后，受到中国人民解放军的宽大待遇。
    四月三日上午，当罗穆文驾驶F—47型318号飞机窜扰晋江县境被我军击落而跳伞降落后，当场被我军生俘。当时，他衣衫单薄，因寒冷和恐惧而浑身发抖，人民解放军战士当即把自己穿的大衣脱下来为他披上，并向他解释了人民解放军宽待俘虏的政策。接着，便把他带到临时休息的地点，给他在跳伞时擦伤的地方敷了药，并给他吃饭。第二天，人民解放军还发给他新的便服、毛巾、牙刷、牙膏、肥皂和零用钱。罗穆文激动地说：“想不到我作了俘虏还会受到人民解放军这样宽大的待遇，这些事实充分证明：蒋贼所宣传的‘被俘就是死路’完全是骗人的鬼话。”
