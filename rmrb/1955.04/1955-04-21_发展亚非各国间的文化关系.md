Developing Cultural Relations Between Asian and African Countries
Hong Shen

The Asian-African Conference of great historical significance has triumphantly opened. Representatives from twenty-nine Asian and African countries are broadly and enthusiastically exchanging opinions to promote amity and cooperation among nations, explore and advance their mutual and common interests, and establish and enhance friendly and good-neighborly relations. Their voices reflect the common aspirations of the fourteen hundred million people of Asia and Africa, and fully demonstrate that the struggle of the Asian and African people for national independence and state sovereignty, for economic development and cultural prosperity, has entered a new stage; Asian and African countries and their people have won an unshakable and important position in the modern world.

The people of Asia and Africa are hardworking, intelligent, and courageous people. Since the dawn of humanity, our ancestors have been engaged in the sowing and cultivation of culture on these two vast lands. In the struggle to conquer nature, pursue truth, and defend freedom and independence, they have propelled history forward century after century. They achieved great accomplishments in architecture, water conservancy, medicine, astronomy, mathematics, and scientific inventions such as the compass and printing, laying the foundation for modern scientific civilization. They left behind some of the oldest and most beautiful poems, brilliant art, and outstanding scientific works, which still possess vigorous vitality and educational significance today. Their immortal contributions to human civilization will always make us proud and move forward with confidence.

The reason why the culture of various Asian and African nations could flourish in history and become a spectacle of Eastern culture is inseparable from the cultural exchanges between the nations. The creators of Asian and African cultures knew that just as a happy life must be built on the foundation of peace and friendship, a beautiful national culture can only be enriched and improved in the process of mutual exchange. Therefore, they once traveled tirelessly for years across deserts and seas to connect the ideas and cultures of different nations. Their great vision and noble spirit pointed the way for the prosperity and development of human culture.

In the past, cultural exchanges between Asian and African nations were extensive, diverse in form, and very rich in content. According to historical records, the Chinese people have shown concern and yearning for the ancient Egyptian culture since ancient times, and there have been some cultural contacts between the two countries. China established cultural ties with Middle Eastern countries more than two thousand years ago. After the seventh century AD, Arabic and Persian cultures were widely spread to China, and at the same time, Chinese culture was introduced to Europe through the Middle East, initiating the exchange between Chinese and Western cultures. Nearly a thousand years ago, the great Arab physician Avicenna absorbed the essence of Chinese medicine into his monumental work "The Canon of Medicine," which had a great influence. As for the Arabian folk tale "One Thousand and One Nights," which was later introduced to China, it is a beloved reading material for Chinese children and teenagers. The cultural exchange between China and India and Myanmar has a long history, which is closely related to the spread of Buddhism. Buddhism may have been introduced to China from India in the first century AD. The historical fact that the famous Chinese monk Xuanzang and others trekked through mountains and rivers to seek scriptures in India is vividly reflected in the full-length novel "Journey to the West," which is recited by people all over the world. The influence of Indian culture on ancient Chinese art is clearly manifested in the murals of Dunhuang. At the same time, the achievements of ancient Chinese culture, such as papermaking technology introduced to India in the seventh century, also helped the development of Indian culture. The craftsmanship of Myanmar, especially the exquisite lacquerware and ivory and jade carvings, has long been appreciated by the Chinese people, and it is very similar in style to Chinese works of art of the same kind, which of course has historical origins. The cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Indonesian people can also be traced back to historical sites two thousand years ago. In the early fifth century, the eminent Chinese monk Faxian visited Java. At the same time, envoys from Bali and Sumatra visited our country, and their activities are depicted in the Indonesian classical literature "Hang Tuah" hero biography. Later, the Chinese navigator Zheng He and others visited those beautiful islands many times, leaving a glorious page in the history of cultural exchange between China and Indonesia. As for the close cultural relations between China and Japan, it is well known.

It must be pointed out that in the past, cultural exchanges between Asian and African countries were conducted in the spirit of equality and mutual benefit. This kind of cultural exchange requires all nations to recognize each other's precious contributions to the entire cultural treasure trove with their national characteristics and features, and to acknowledge that these contributions are worthy of their appreciation, thus sincerely respecting the glorious position occupied by the other party in the cultural field. In fact, only on this basis can cultural exchanges promote the development of the inherent culture of various nations and the prosperity of human culture, and help the mutual understanding of people of all countries and friendly and good-neighborly relations between nations. Culture, friendship, and peace are inseparable. Cultural exchanges between Asian and African countries precisely embody this truth. Only those colonialists who preach racial discrimination and incite wars deliberately distort this truth, just as they attempt to obliterate the merits of the sowers of ancient culture from the harvest of modern culture.

Colonialists came to Asian and African countries with weapons and sucking tubes. They brought poverty to the people of Asia and Africa and showed contempt, insult, and destruction to the cultural traditions of various Asian and African nations. They absurdly and shamelessly attacked the national self-confidence of the Asian and African people in order to consolidate their enslavement rule. They used the trick of stealing the sky and changing the day, spreading their yellow culture depicting horror and pornography on the one hand, and unscrupulously stealing our precious cultural relics on the other hand. At the same time, they regarded the traditional friendship between the various Asian and African nations as a thorn in their side, viciously dividing us and trying to provoke us into a tragic self-slaughter. Those dark years like long nights seriously hindered the development of Asian and African culture, but did not shake the national self-confidence of the Asian and African people. The people of Asian and African countries know deeply that without foreign aggression, oppression, and exploitation, then we who used our hands and brains to build the pyramids, the Great Wall, and Ajanta, can and will create modern industrial culture. Japan after the Meiji Restoration is an example; unfortunately, Japan later took the wrong path under the leadership of the militarists, so that today it is also suffering from disasters and humiliation from across the Pacific Ocean. Under common circumstances, the people of Asian and African countries encouraged each other and carried out the struggle for national independence and state sovereignty. This struggle has achieved great victories, and more and more people of Asian and African countries have shattered the chains of colonialism and stood up heroically.

Today, the victorious Chinese people are enthusiastically building their motherland. In cultural construction, on the one hand, we carry forward the long-standing national traditions, so that they can thrive in the soil of people's lives and under the shining light of patriotism; on the other hand, we redouble our efforts to learn from the advanced science and excellent national cultures of all countries in the world. The Chinese nation has consistently respected and is good at absorbing the cultures of other nations. Today, just as we have adopted the policy of "bringing forth the new from the old, let a hundred flowers bloom" in our domestic art undertakings, we advocate the common development and mutual enrichment of the cultures of all nations in the world. We sincerely hope to conduct cultural exchanges with people of all countries, especially with the people of Eastern countries with whom we have long-standing cultural relations, on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. We believe that this kind of cultural exchange is necessary for the peaceful and happy cultural life of each other and the prosperity of human culture.

In the five and a half years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the cultural activities between our people and the people of many Eastern countries have developed considerably. Hundreds of cultural representatives from various countries, including famous scientists, writers, musicians, professors, etc., have visited our country one after another. Our country and India frequently exchange cultural delegations; we have also exchanged cultural delegations with Myanmar more than once. A friendly delegation from our country has just returned from India, and a Buddhist delegation is visiting Myanmar. The Indian Art Troupe and the Indonesian Art Troupe, which came to our country to perform in 1953 and 1954 respectively, have been warmly welcomed by our broad audience with their music and dance full of national characteristics. We have also received cultural delegations from Japan and Ceylon, as well as religious leaders from Ceylon and Pakistan. Our sports circles are preparing to invite athletes from Egypt to our country for friendly competitions. Secondly, we have also held many exhibitions with many countries, including the Japanese woodcut exhibition and the art exhibitions of India and Indonesia, etc. exhibited in our country. At the International Fair in Damascus, the capital of Syria, in September last year, the Chinese Pavilion was appreciated and praised by nearly 600,000 viewers; this greatly encouraged our desire to restore and develop our cultural exchanges with the cultural countries of the Middle East. In addition, our country has also translated and published hundreds of literary and scientific works from Japan, India, Indonesia, Turkey, and other countries, and is currently translating and producing films from India, Japan, and other countries. Chinese readers love Japanese novels, Tagore's poetry collections, Burmese folk tales, and Indonesian folk songs as much as they love their own literary and artistic works.

From the cultural exchanges in the past few years, we deeply feel that the people of various Eastern countries have not only resolutely defended their national cultural traditions in the struggle against colonialism in modern times, but also bravely developed this tradition. A new fighting national culture full of patriotic spirit has already been born; it is now growing rapidly among the masses of the people, and it is inspiring them to strengthen the fight. This is the horn of welcome to the dawn, and it is getting louder and louder.

The culture of the Chinese nation and the nations of Asian and African countries are consistent in terms of historical traditions and development direction. Our people are willing to conduct more cultural exchange activities with the people of all countries in the future to meet each other's cultural needs, enhance mutual understanding and friendship, and ensure peace in the East and the world.

We also fully believe that with the consolidation of independence and freedom and the development of economic and cultural construction in Asian and African countries, cultural exchanges with a glorious history will gradually be universally revived and rise; the culture of the new Asian and African people will grow stronger day by day, becoming a full and active torrent, making greater contributions to the ocean of human culture.

On this surging torrent, let the dross of colonialism disappear like spit! As for the Asian and African people themselves, they will sing the praises of life and move forward forever.

    发展亚非各国间的文化关系
    洪深
    具有重大历史性意义的亚非会议胜利开幕了。二十九个亚非国家的代表们，为了促进各国间的亲善和合作，探讨和促进它们相互间的和共同的利益，建立和增进友好睦邻关系，正在广泛而热烈地交换意见。他们的声音反映着十四亿亚非人民的共同意愿，并且充分证明：亚非人民长期以来争取民族独立和国家主权、争取经济发展和文化繁荣的斗争已经进入一个崭新的阶段；亚非国家和它们的人民已经在现代世界上赢得了不可动摇的重要地位。
    亚非人民是勤劳、智慧而勇敢的人民。我们的祖先从人类黎明期开始，就在这两片广大的土地上从事着文化的播种和耕耘。他们在征服自然、追求真理和捍卫自由独立的斗争中，一个世纪又一个世纪地推动着历史前进。他们在建筑、水利、医药、天文、数学及指南针、印刷术等科学发明方面，都曾达到很高的成就，为近代科学文明奠定了基础。他们留下了不少最古老的美丽的诗篇、辉煌的艺术和卓越的科学著作，这些作品直到如今还具有旺盛的生命力和教育意义。他们对人类文明所作的不朽贡献，将永远使我们感到自豪并满怀信心地继续前进。
    亚非各民族的文化在历史上其所以能蓬勃发展，蔚为东方文化的壮观，是和各民族之间的文化交流分不开的。亚非文化的创造者们知道，正如愉快的生活必须建立在和平和友谊的基础上，优美的民族文化也只能在彼此交流的过程中获得充实和提高。因此他们曾经不惮劳苦，经年累月地在荒漠和大海上相互往还，沟通着民族间的思想文化。他们这种伟大的创见和崇高的精神，为人类文化的繁荣和发展指示了道路。
    过去亚非各民族间的文化交流，范围是广大的，式样是繁多的，内容是非常丰富的。根据史书的记载，从古时起中国人民就对古老的埃及文化表示关心、向往，并且两国文化有过一些接触。中国同中东各国在两千多年以前发生了文化上的联系。公元七世纪以后，阿拉伯文化和波斯文化被普遍传播到中国来，同时中国文化经过中东被介绍到欧洲去，开中西文化交流的先声。将近一千年以前，阿拉伯大医学家阿维森纳曾将中国的医学精华吸收在他的巨著“医典”中，影响很大。至于后来传入中国的阿拉伯民间故事“天方夜谭”，更是中国儿童和少年所热爱的读物。中国同印度、缅甸之间的文化交流是源远流长的，这同佛教的传播有密切关系。佛教从印度传入中国，可能是公元一世纪的事。我国唐代著名僧人玄奘等跋山涉水往印度求经的史实，栩栩如生地反映在长篇小说“西游记”中，为世界人民所传诵。印度文化对中国古代艺术的影响鲜明地表现在敦煌壁画中，同时中国古代文化的成就，例如七世纪传入印度的造纸术，也曾有助于印度文化的发展。缅甸的工艺美术，特别是精美的漆器和象牙、玉石雕刻，早已获得中国人民的欣赏，并且和中国的同类艺术品在风格上很相似，这当然是有历史渊源的。中国人民同印度尼西亚人民的文化来往，也可以追溯到两千年以前的史迹。五世纪初，中国高僧法显就到过爪哇。同时从峇厘和苏门答腊都有使者来我国访问，他们的活动给描写在印度尼西亚古典文学“杭都亚”英雄传中。后来我国明代航海家郑和等人屡次访问那些秀丽的岛屿，在中国同印度尼西亚文化交流史上留下辉煌的一页。至于中国同日本之间的密切的文化关系，更是众所周知的事。
    必须指出，过去亚非各国之间的文化交流是以平等互利的精神来进行的。这种文化交流要求各个民族彼此承认对方以其民族的特点和特色对整个文化宝库所作的珍贵贡献，承认这些贡献是值得自己欣赏的，因而衷心地尊重对方在文化领域中所占的光荣地位。实际上也只有在这样的基础上，文化交流才能促进各个民族的固有文化的发展和人类文化的繁荣，并有助于各国人民的互相谅解和国际间的友好睦邻关系。文化、友谊、和平，三者是互不可分的。亚非国家间的文化交流，恰恰体现着这个真理。只有那些宣传种族歧视和煽动战争的殖民主义者才故意歪曲这个真理，正如他们企图从现代文化的收获中抹煞古代文化播种者的功劳一样。
    殖民主义者是携着武器、咬着吸血管来到亚非国家的。他们给亚非人民带来了贫困，对亚非各民族的文化传统加以蔑视、污辱和摧残。他们荒谬无耻地打击着亚非人民的民族自信心，以便巩固他们的奴役统治。他们施展偷天换日的伎俩，一面散播他们的描写恐怖和色情的黄色文化，一面肆无忌惮地盗窃我们的珍贵文物。同时他们将亚非各民族之间的传统友谊看做眼中钉，恶毒地分裂我们，企图挑拨我们卷入自相残杀的悲剧。那些漫漫长夜似的黑暗岁月严重地阻碍了亚非文化的发展，但是并没有动摇亚非人民的民族自信心。亚非各国人民深深知道，如果没有外来的侵略、压迫和剥削，那么我们使用自己的建筑过金字塔、长城和阿旃陀的双手和大脑，是可以而且一定会创造了现代工业文化的。明治维新后的日本就是一个例子；可惜后来日本在军国主义者的领导下走错了道路，以致今天同样遭受到来自太平洋彼岸的灾难和屈辱。亚非各国人民在共同的遭遇下互相鼓励，进行着争取民族独立和国家主权的斗争。这个斗争业已取得巨大的胜利，越来越多的亚非国家的人民已经粉碎殖民主义的锁链，英勇地站起来了。
    胜利的中国人民今天正在热情地建设自己的祖国。在文化建设中，我们一面发扬悠久的民族传统，使它在人民生活的土壤里和爱国主义光辉的照耀下欣欣滋长；一面加倍努力向世界各国的先进科学和优秀的民族文化学习。中华民族是一贯地尊重并善于吸收别的民族文化的。今天正如我们在本国艺术事业中采取了“推陈出新，百花齐放”的方针一样，我们主张世界上所有民族的文化共同发展和相互丰富。我们热诚地希望在平等互利的原则下同各国人民特别是和我们有悠久文化关系的东方各国人民进行文化交流。我们相信这种文化交流对于彼此的和平幸福的文化生活和人类文化的繁荣都是必需的。
    中华人民共和国成立五年半以来，我国人民同许多东方国家的人民之间的文化活动有了相当的发展。成百上千的各国文化代表们，包括著名的科学家、作家、音乐家、教授等等，先后来我国访问参观过。我国同印度经常有文化代表团来往；同缅甸也不只一次交换过文化代表团。我国一个友好代表团刚刚从印度回来、一个佛教代表团正在缅甸进行访问。一九五三年和一九五四年先后来我国表演的印度艺术代表团和印度尼西亚艺术团，曾经以它们的富有民族色彩的音乐舞蹈获得我国广大观众的热烈欢迎。我们也接待过日本和锡兰的文化代表团以及锡兰、巴基斯坦宗教界的领袖人物。我国体育界正在准备邀请埃及的运动员来我国作友谊比赛。其次，我们还同许多国家相互举办过不少展览会，其中在我国展出的包括日本的木刻画展和印度、印度尼西亚的艺术展览会等等。去年九月在叙利亚首都大马士革的国际博览会上，中国展览馆曾受到近六十万观众的欣赏和赞扬；这大大鼓舞了我们对于恢复和发展我国与中东各文化之邦的文化交流的愿望。此外，我国还翻译出版了日本、印度、印度尼西亚、土耳其等国的文学及科学著作共数百种，并正在译制印度、日本等国的电影片。我国读者喜爱日本的小说、泰戈尔的诗集、缅甸民间故事和印度尼西亚民歌，如同喜爱本国的文艺作品一样。
    从过去几年的文化交流我们深深感到，东方各国人民在近代以来反抗殖民主义的斗争中不仅坚决地保卫了自己的民族文化传统，而且勇敢地发展了这一传统。一种洋溢着爱国精神的新的战斗的民族文化早已诞生；它今天正在人民大众中迅速茁长，并激励着他们加强战斗。这就是迎接黎明的号角，它愈来愈响亮了。
    中华民族同亚非各国民族的文化，在历史传统上和发展的方向上都是一致的。我国人民愿意同各国人民今后进行更多的文化交流活动，来满足彼此的文化需求，增进相互间的了解和友谊，并保障东方及世界和平。
    我们也完全相信，随着亚非各国独立自由的巩固和经济、文化建设的开展，有过光辉历史的文化交流将逐渐普遍地复兴、高涨；新的亚非人民的文化将随之日益壮大，成为一支丰满活跃的巨流，向人类文化的海洋作更大的贡献。
    在这汹涌澎湃的巨流之上，让殖民主义的渣滓像唾沫般地消逝吧！至于亚非人民自己，他们将高唱生活的赞歌，永远前进。
