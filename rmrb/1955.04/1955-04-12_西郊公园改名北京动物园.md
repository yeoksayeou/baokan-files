    West Suburb Park outside Xizhimen in Beijing has recently been renamed Beijing Zoo.
    In the early days after Liberation, this park only had a few dozen animals. Now it has more than a thousand animals, making it the largest zoo in the country. The zoo has animals such as the mongoose and crested gibbon from Hainan Island, the yellow sheep from Inner Mongolia, the red panda from Sichuan, the Yangtze River crocodile, the Northeast tiger, and mandarin ducks and swans. In addition, there are many foreign animals, such as African lions, ostriches, zebras, and antelopes, Australian emus, Japanese white hibiscus birds, Eastern European bison, Arctic polar bears, and pumas.
    Currently, the Beijing Zoo is also sending many people to Xikang, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Northeast China to collect animals.

    西郊公园改名北京动物园
    北京市西直门外的西郊公园最近改名为北京动物园。
    解放初期，这个公园只有几十只动物，现在有一千多只动物，是全国规模最大的动物园。园里有海南岛的獴鼠、冠叶猴，内蒙古的黄羊，四川的小熊猫，扬子江鳄鱼，东北虎和鸳鸯、天鹅等动物。另外还有很多国外的动物，如非洲的狮、鸵鸟、斑马、羚羊，澳洲的鸸鹋，日本的白芙蓉，东欧的野牛，北极的白熊，美洲狮等。
    现在，北京动物园还派出很多人在西康、广东、广西、东北等地收集动物。
