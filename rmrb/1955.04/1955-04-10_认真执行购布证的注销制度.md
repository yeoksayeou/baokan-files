Earnestly Implement the Cancellation System for Cloth Purchase Certificates

To the Editor:

Since the nationwide implementation of the unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth on September 15, 1954, the practice of buying cotton cloth with cloth purchase certificates has effectively ensured the implementation of the cotton cloth planned supply policy.

However, recently, some grassroots cooperatives and cotton yarn and cloth companies in the Changzhi Special District have not paid enough attention to the system of retrieving and storing cloth purchase certificates, resulting in "canceled cloth certificates" being recirculated on the market. This should be noted. According to the Gaoping County Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, when the Lijiahe Grassroots Cooperative of Gaoping County went to the county cotton yarn and cloth company to purchase goods, the cloth purchase certificate contained canceled cloth purchase certificates from the Yangzhuang Grassroots Cooperative of Qinshui County. According to statistics from the Changzhi City Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, the Second Sales Department of the Changzhi City Retail Company received five chi of "canceled cloth certificates" from Hezi No. 29 of Lingchuan County, thirty chi of "canceled cloth certificates" from the Yangzhuang Grassroots Cooperative of Qinshui County, fifty chi of "canceled cloth certificates" from Hezi No. 121 of Luan County, and twenty-five chi of "canceled cloth certificates" from Hezi No. 4 within a few days. The result of these used cloth purchase certificates circulating on the market not only increases the cotton cloth supply plan and causes chaos in the market, but also creates a bad political impact among the masses.

Where did these used cloth purchase certificates come from? As everyone knows, cloth purchase certificates are issued to the masses level by level by the People's Committees of various counties. The masses purchase cloth at state-owned companies, cooperatives, and private stores with the certificates. After receiving the cloth purchase certificates, the retail departments stamp them with a cancellation seal before purchasing goods from the cotton yarn and cloth company. Obviously, these "canceled cloth certificates" flowed into the market from state-owned commercial departments. The Gaoping County Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company lost a total of 2,100 chi of cloth purchase certificates in February, and the Dongxiazhuang Grassroots Cooperative in Licheng County lost 1,050 chi of cloth purchase certificates. This situation should be noted by commercial departments in various regions.

    认真执行购布证的注销制度编辑同志：
    一九五四年九月十五日全国实行棉布统购统销以来，因为采取了凭购布证的买棉布作法，有效地保证了棉布计划供应政策的实施。
    但是，最近长治专区有些基层合作社和花纱布公司不重视购布证的收回保管制度，造成“注销布证”重新流通到市场上来，这是应该引起注意的。据高平县花纱布公司反映，高平县李家河基层合作社到县花纱布公司进货时，购布证内夹有沁水县杨庄基层社注销过的购布证。长治市花纱布公司统计，长治市零售公司第二门市部，几天以内就收到陵川县合字第二十九号“注销布证”五尺，沁水县杨庄基层社的“注销布证”三十尺，潞安县合字第一二一号“注销布证”五十尺，合字第四号“注销布证”二十五尺。这些使用过的购布证在市场上流通的结果，不仅增大了棉布的供应计划，引起市场上的混乱，而且在群众中造成了不好的政治影响。
    这些使用过的购布证是从哪里来的呢？大家知道，购布证是由各县人民委员会，逐级发给群众，群众凭证到国营公司、合作社、私营商店购布，零售部门收到购布证后，加盖了注销章到花纱布公司进货。很明显，这些“注销布证”就是从国营商业部门里流到市场上的。高平县花纱布公司二月份共遗失了购布证二千一百尺，黎城县东下庄基层社丢失购布证一千零五十尺。这种情况应该引起各地商业部门的注意。　张嵩
