	The Evil Consequences of Pursuing Form
	Ma Haoran
	Due to the Party and the government's emphasis on education, in recent years, the Mining College, the Iron and Steel College, the Petroleum College, the Geology College... have been successively built in the western suburbs of the capital. Such large-scale construction of institutions of higher learning is unprecedented in the history of our country.
	The construction of universities requires huge investments. When the country is currently concentrating its efforts on industrial construction, we should use the state's education construction funds economically so that it can maximize the effect of the investment. But in fact, not all cultural and educational construction units and architectural design departments pay good attention to saving, and there is still a lot of waste in construction. Here, a teaching building of the Mining College is an example.
	A teaching building of the Mining College, built last year, according to the original grand plan of the original designer, was intended "to take on the important task of changing the face of the cultural and educational area." As a result, this building, due to its pursuit of form, is not only inconvenient to use, but also wasted a lot of funds. According to preliminary calculations, the large roof and attached balconies alone wasted 73,400 yuan in labor and material costs. The large roof includes hip-and-gable, hipped-gable, and hip roof construction methods. The wood wasted due to the large roof alone was 155 cubic meters, and the iron parts were 3,660 kilograms (excluding the figures required for general roof trusses). This is equivalent to spending an extra 7.25 yuan per square meter of area. If we add the waste in other structural aspects and some unnecessary decorations due to the constraints of the large roof, the amount of waste is even more astonishing. If we calculate the cost per square meter according to the budget of 118 yuan, it shows that nearly 190,000 yuan of funds in the total cost were not well utilized.
	How did this design thinking and method of pursuing form alone arise and develop? According to Wang Tinghui, the main person in charge of the original design, this design thinking germinated when he saw the design drawings of the Xijiao Guest House. At that time, he only felt that this glazed tile roof was very luxurious and magnificent. Later, after listening to speeches by some people who advocated large roofs, he became even more yearning for the architectural form of large roofs. Therefore, when he accepted the design task of the teaching building of the Mining College, he decided to adopt the form of a large roof.
	Designing a large roof form requires a very tortuous plane. In order to express the hipped-gable roof in the middle and the hipped-gable roofs on both wings, it was necessary to lengthen the originally available simple channel-shaped plane from the end points of the two wings. However, the decoration of the top and eaves of the large roof was still relatively simple at first.
	In order to make this project "more perfect," the designer sent the preliminary design drawings to a professor at Tsinghua University for consultation, and also visited the dougong used in a large roof project designed by Tsinghua University. As a result, he returned and added decorations such as treasure tops, walking beasts, dougong, and rafters to the original design drawings. At the same time, two pavilions were added to the fourth floor, becoming what it is now.
	Now, let us measure the evil consequences of this blind pursuit of form from the aspect of applicability!
	In this construction project, just for a room under each of the two hipped-gable roofs, a dedicated staircase must be set up, and the connection between this room and the surrounding rooms is very inconvenient. The fourth floors built to increase the height of the rear building all adopt the form of a one-sided corridor, and are designed as "empty corridors." When winter comes, the cold wind blows in through the "empty corridors," which greatly affects students taking classes here. In addition, in the entire third floor of the east wing, due to the separation of laboratories and classrooms in the middle, students who want to go to the middle of the building must go down to the third floor and run across the yard. In addition, in order to coordinate up and down and achieve a magnificent view, the parapet wall was built more than three meters high, and large platforms and escalators with an area of 140 square meters were unnecessarily designed outside the front and rear entrances.
	This attitude of starting only from form, without considering the effect of investment, and squandering state property without cherishing it, cannot continue. Construction units and design departments, especially those who directly participate in the design, should learn lessons from these mistakes.

### 追求形式的恶果

    追求形式的恶果
    马浩然
    由于党和政府对教育事业的重视，几年来，在首都西郊，矿业学院、钢铁学院、石油学院、地质学院……相继地建设起来了。像这样大规模地建设高等学校，在我国的历史上是从来没有过的。
    建设高等学校需要巨额投资。当目前国家正集中力量进行工业建设的时候，我们应该节约地使用国家所交给我们的这项文教建设资金，使它发挥投资的最大效果。但事实上，并不是所有的文教建设单位和建筑设计部门都很好地重视节约，在建设中还存在着很大的浪费现象。这里，矿业学院的一幢教学大楼就是个例子。
    矿业学院在去年建设起来的一幢教学大楼，按照原设计者原来的宏图是：“它要负起改变文教区面貌的重大任务。”结果这幢建筑由于追求形式，不仅使用起来不方便，而且浪费了很多资金。据初步计算，仅大屋顶和附属的阳台等就浪费了工料费达七万三千四百元。大屋顶包括着歇山、十字歇山、庑殿三种作法，由于大屋顶所浪费的木料就有一百五十五立方公尺，铁件有三千六百六十公斤（除去一般屋架所需的数字）。等于在每平方公尺的面积上多花了七元二角五分。如果再把因受大屋顶形式牵制增加其他结构方面的浪费和一些不必要的装饰折算下来，这个浪费的数字就更惊人了。如果每平方公尺按一百一十八元的预算造价来计算，就说明在总造价中有近十九万元的资金没有被很好地利用。
    这种追求形式的设计思想和方法是如何发生发展起来的呢？据原设计主要负责人王庭蕙谈，他这种设计思想是从见到西郊招待所的设计图纸时萌芽的。当时只觉得这种琉璃瓦屋顶非常豪华壮丽，后来又听了某些提倡大屋顶的人的讲话，对于大屋顶的建筑形式更加向往了。因此当他接受了矿业学院教学大楼的设计任务后，就决定采用大屋顶的形式。
    设计大屋顶形式要求平面非常曲折。为了要表现中间的歇山屋顶和两翼的十字歇山屋顶，不得不把原来可用的简单的槽形平面，从两翼的端点伸长。不过最初大屋顶的顶部和檐部的装饰还是较为简单的。
    为了使这项工程“更趋完善”，设计者曾把初步设计图送去向清华大学的一位教授请教，并且参观了清华大学设计的一项大屋顶工程所用的斗拱。于是，回来就在原有设计图纸上又加上了宝顶、走兽、斗拱、椽子等装饰。同时在四层部分又增加了两个亭子，成了现在的样子。
    现在，让我们再从适用方面来衡量一下这种一味追求形式所造成的恶果吧！
    在这个建筑工程中，只是为了两个十字歇山屋顶下面的一间房屋，就要各设一个专用楼梯，而这间屋子同四周的房屋的联系，又非常不便。为了增加后面建筑物的高度所修建的四层都是采用单面走廊的形式，并且设计为“空廊”。冬天来临时，寒冷的风通过“空廊”吹进，学生在这里上课很受影响，另外在东翼的整个三层部分，由于中间有实验室和教室的分隔，同学们如想到大楼的中部去，必须下了三楼，再跑过院子才行。另外，为了上下调和，取得壮观，又把女儿墙砌成三公尺多高，不必要地在前后入门的外部设计了面积具有一百四十平方公尺的大平台和扶梯。
    这种只从形式出发，毫不考虑投资效果，和对国家资财不加爱惜的挥霍态度，不能够再继续下去了。建设单位和设计部门，特别是直接参加设计者，应该从这些错误中吸取教训。
