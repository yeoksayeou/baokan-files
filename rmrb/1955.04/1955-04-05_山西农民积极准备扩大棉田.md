    Shanxi Farmers Actively Prepare to Expand Cotton Fields
    Farmers in Shanxi Province are actively preparing to expand cotton fields to support national construction. According to statistics from thirteen counties including Wenshui and Xiaoyi, they plan to plant more than 930,000 mu of cotton this year, exceeding the task assigned by higher authorities by more than 7,900 mu. Wenxi County plans to plant more than 16,000 mu of cotton this year, an increase of 29 percent over last year.
    In order to ensure the completion of this year's cotton planting plan, all cotton-producing areas are paying close attention to the storage of cotton seeds. The Yuncheng Special District has stored more than 7 million jin of cotton seeds, focusing on solving the difficulty of seed shortage in the new cotton-growing areas. The Yuci Special District has stored more than 3.8 million jin of high-quality Jinzi cotton seeds, which have now begun to be allocated to farmers. Farmers in Wanrong, Linfen, and Hongzhao counties also exchanged more than 700,000 jin of cotton seeds, which not only solved the difficulty of seed shortage, but also expanded the planting area of high-quality cotton seeds. At present, farmers in various places are carrying out work such as seed selection, fertilizer accumulation, and spring plowing to preserve soil moisture. (Guo Shi)

    山西农民积极准备扩大棉田
    山西省农民积极准备扩大棉田，支援国家建设。据文水、孝义等十三个县的统计，今年计划植棉九十三万多亩，超过上级布置任务七千九百多亩。闻喜县今年计划种植棉花一万六千多亩，比去年扩大了百分之二十九。
    为了保证完成今年棉田播种计划，各产棉区都很注意棉籽的储备工作。运城专区已储备棉籽七百多万斤，着重解决了新棉区缺种的困难。榆次专区储备优良棉种金字棉籽有三百八十多万斤，现已开始调拨到农民手中。万荣、临汾、洪赵三县农民还互换棉种七十多万斤，不但解决了缺种困难，并扩大了优良棉种的种植面积。目前各地农民正在进行选种、积肥和春耕保墒等工作。　（郭石）
