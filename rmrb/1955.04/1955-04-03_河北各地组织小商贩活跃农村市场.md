    According to incomplete statistics from late March, in Zhangjiakou and Cangxian prefectures alone, and in eight counties including Ji County, Changping, Tong County, Yongnian, Sanhe, Feixiang, Miyun, and Fangshan, 77 cooperative groups (or cooperative stores) have already been organized, with 790 distribution households, 38 oil peddlers, 340 traveling peddlers, and 390 sales agents. These small merchants and vendors represent various industries. They travel from village to village and town to town, engaging in business and becoming a force in invigorating the primary rural market. For example, Ji County organized ten specialized oil peddlers who specialize in delivering oil to mountainous areas and remote rural areas, which is very popular among the masses. In Longyao County, forty-seven vendors were organized in half a month, with a total of 420 yuan worth of goods purchased on behalf of customers, over 1,000 yuan worth of cooking oil and general merchandise distributed, and 750 yuan worth of goods sold on commission.
    In many areas, supply and marketing cooperatives have also established wholesale outlets and vigorously developed wholesale business. Incomplete statistics from the three prefectures of Handan, Cangxian, and Tongxian alone show that wholesale sales to small merchants and vendors in February reached more than 3.6 million yuan in old currency.
    All small vendors who are organized for distribution and commission sales have shown the superiority of being organized, inspired the enthusiasm of small merchants and vendors, and expanded their business volume. For example, the stationery, general merchandise, and sundries cooperative group organized in Changping County consists of three households with five people. Now, the average daily sales volume is 58 yuan, an increase of 20% compared to before being organized. The Dulin cooperative store in Cang County consists of eight households. Before being organized, the monthly business volume was 900 yuan to 1,600 yuan; after being organized, the monthly business volume is 2,500 yuan to 3,000 yuan. Wang Dianrong, a cooking oil merchant in the area, averaged 300 yuan per month before the unified purchase and sale system. His family of six could not make ends meet, so he stopped doing business. Now, he distributes goods for the cooperative and averages 500 yuan per month, earning more than 30 yuan, which can solve the family's livelihood. (Zhang Shuhua)

    河北各地组织小商贩活跃农村市场
    据三月下旬的不完全统计，仅张家口、沧县两专区和蓟县、昌平、通县、永年、三河、肥乡、密云、房山等八个县，已组织起来的合作小组（或合作商店）有七十七个，经销户七百九十个，油挑三十八个，货郎担三百四十个，代销员三百九十人。这些小商小贩包括各种不同行业。他们串村串乡，从事经营，成为活跃农村初级市场的一支力量。如蓟县组织专业性送油小贩十人，专门到山区和偏僻农村送油，深受群众欢迎。隆尧县半个月内组织起四十七名小贩，代购总值为四百二十元，经销食油、百货等总值为一千多元，代销为七百五十元。
    很多地区供销合作社还建立了一些批发门市部，大力开展批发业务。仅邯郸、沧县、通县三个专区不完全统计，二月份对小商小贩批发额达旧币三百六十多万元。
    凡经组织起来经销、代销的小商贩，都显示了组织起来的优越性，启发了小商小贩经营的积极性，扩大了经营额。如昌平县组织起来的文具、百货、杂货合作小组共三户五个人，现在平均每天销货额五十八元，较未组织前上升百分之二十。沧县杜林合作商店共八户，未组织前每月经营九百元到一千六百元，组织起来后每月经营二千五百元到三千元。该地食油商王殿荣在统销以前每月平均经营三百元，全家六口人，不能维持生活，因而停业。现在给合作社经销每月平均经营五百元，收入三十余元，能解决全家生活。  （张淑华）
