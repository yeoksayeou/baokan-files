    The Key to Sino-Japanese Trade Negotiations
    By our reporter, Wang Xi
    The voices of Japanese economic circles and the broad masses of the people demanding Japan's economic independence and requesting the government to take measures to further develop Sino-Japanese trade have become even louder since the arrival of the Chinese trade delegation to Japan.
    On the 11th, the Sino-Japanese Trade Promotion Association, with the participation of seventy-eight companies, held a conference and passed a resolution stating: "In order to enable Sino-Japanese trade to achieve further development, there must be cooperation from the government." On the 17th, a conference of two hundred people from local business circles across Japan to promote Sino-Japanese trade passed a resolution: demanding that the government guarantee the complete implementation of the new Sino-Japanese trade agreement to be concluded; demanding the lifting of the embargo; the mutual establishment of authoritative trade representative offices in both countries; and demanding that the governments of both countries conclude a payment agreement.
    On the other hand, the Chinese trade delegation to Japan also expressed a positive attitude and desire for the development of Sino-Japanese trade. The head of the delegation, Lei Renmin, said at a reception for Japanese journalists in Osaka: "During the delegation's short time and limited visits, it has been discovered that Japan has many products that China needs for its economic construction. The Kansai region is not only capable of producing these things, but also has the ability to export them. Therefore, as long as the artificial obstacles are overcome based on the needs and possibilities of both parties, and the abnormal state of trade in the past, where one party only exported consumer goods, is eliminated, the trade between the two countries can be further developed and normalized." His speech brought encouragement to the Japanese people, who personally heard that their ardent desire for economic independence and the development of trade with China had gained the support of the Chinese people. Various circles in the Kansai region repeatedly said when bidding farewell to the Chinese trade delegation: They hope that the Sino-Japanese trade agreement negotiations held in Tokyo will proceed smoothly, so as to further develop the trade relations between the two countries.
    But what about the attitude of the Japanese government? When the two sides began to discuss the substantive issues of Sino-Japanese trade, the "Asahi Shimbun" published an interview on the 16th with Mr. Itagaki, Director of the Trade Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, with Japanese reporters. Itagaki said: "Relaxing the embargoed items is extremely difficult now." He also said that establishing a direct payment and settlement relationship between the two countries is "difficult to achieve" in the current situation, and the Chinese side should understand "Japan's position."
    In the past two days, at the comprehensive group meetings that were being held for negotiations, the Japanese negotiators, while acknowledging that the current method of payment through London banks was unreasonable, cited the provisions of the US "Foreign Assets Control Regulations," repeatedly stating: Even if accounts were opened between the Bank of China and the Bank of Tokyo (a non-national bank) and a method similar to clearing accounts was adopted, the Japanese side dared not agree due to US laws. According to the "Mainichi Shimbun" report: This was the result of consultations between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry on the 13th. On the same day, the "Japan Industrial and Economic News" published a Kyodo News Agency dispatch from New York on the 13th under the headline "The United States Exerts Pressure on Sino-Japanese Trade," which stated: "The US government will start with relatively easy areas to prevent Japan from trading with Communist China." This report listed the so-called "easy areas" as intensifying restrictions on Japanese silk fabrics entering the United States, and prohibiting Japanese ships from carrying American cargo to Europe on the grounds that these goods were being "transferred to China." People here believe that this is an annotation to the so-called "difficulties" publicly emphasized by the Japanese government.
    As everyone knows, the Hatoyama government made promises to the Japanese people before and after the general election to "adjust relations with China" and "expand trade with China." Now, whether the third trade agreement being negotiated between China and Japan can obtain guarantees of realization in the negotiations, so that the future trade between the two countries can be further developed, depends on the attitude of the Japanese government.

    中日贸易谈判的关键
    本报记者　汪溪
    日本经济界和广大人民要求日本经济自主，要求政府采取措施，进一步发展日中贸易的声音，在中国访日贸易代表团到达日本后，是更加宏亮了。
    十一日，有七十八个公司参加的中日贸易促进会举行了大会，通过决议说：“为了使中日贸易获得进一步的发展，必须要有政府方面的合作。”十七日，全日地方企业界二百人举行的促进日中贸易大会，通过了决议：要求政府保障将要缔结的新的日中贸易协议的完全实施；要求解除禁运；两国相互设立有权力的贸易常驻机构；要求两国政府之间缔结支付协定。
    另一方面，中国访日贸易代表团也对发展中日贸易表示了积极的态度和愿望。团长雷任民在大阪招待日本新闻记者时说：“代表团在短时间和有限制的参观访问中，已经发现了日本有不少产品是中国进行经济建设所需要的。关西地区不但能够生产这些东西，并且有向外输出的能力。因此只要根据双方的需要和可能，克服人为的阻碍，并且消除过去那种片面的一方只输出消费品的畸形贸易状态，两国的贸易就可以进一步发展和正常化。”他的讲话给日本人民带来了鼓舞，他们亲自听到了他们热切要求经济自主、发展同中国贸易的愿望，得到了中国人民的支持。关西地区的各界在和中国访日贸易代表团送别时一再说：希望在东京举行的中日贸易协议的谈判，能顺利地进行，以便进一步发展两国贸易关系。
    但是日本政府的态度呢？当双方就中日贸易的实质问题开始商谈时，“朝日新闻”十六日发表了日本通商产业省通产局长板垣对日本记者的谈话。板垣说：“对禁运品的放宽，现在是极其困难的。”又说，两国之间建立直接支付清算关系，以现在局势来看是“难以实现”的，中国方面要理解“日本的立场”。
    两天来，在进行谈判的综合小组会议上，日本方面的谈判代表，一方面承认目前通过伦敦银行支付的办法不合理，一方面却搬出了美国的“外国资产管理法”的条例，口口声声表示：即使是在中国银行和东京银行（非国家银行）之间互开帐目，采取近似清算帐目的方式，日本方面碍于美国的法令，也不敢同意。据“每日新闻”报道：这是日本方面在十三日由外务省、大藏省、通商产业省几方面协议的结果。同一天，“日本产业经济新闻”以“美国对中日贸易施加压力”为标题，发表了共同社纽约十三日电，其中说：“美国政府为阻止日本与中共贸易，将从比较容易的地方着手。”这个报道列举了所谓“容易的地方”就是加紧限制日本出口的丝织品进入美国，并禁止日轮在美国承运美国货主运往欧洲的货物，借口是这些东西正被“转运给中国”。此间人士都认为，这是给日本政府公开强调的所谓“困难”加以注解。
    大家知道，鸠山政府在大选前后，曾向日本人民发出过“调整同中国的关系”，“扩大同中国的贸易”的诺言。现在，中日双方正在商谈的第三次贸易协议，能否在谈判中取得实现的保障，从而使今后两国贸易有进一步的发展，关键在于日本政府的态度。
