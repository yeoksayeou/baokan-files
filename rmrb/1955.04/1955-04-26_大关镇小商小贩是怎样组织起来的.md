How Small Traders and Vendors in Daguan Town Were Organized
    Liu Xi, Quan Ming

Daguan Town in Qianxi County, Guizhou Province, is located near a highway, making transportation convenient and commerce relatively developed. In addition to the supply and marketing cooperative's six outlets for cotton cloth, oil and salt, general merchandise, rice and flour, cigarettes and alcohol, and production materials, the town has 220 small traders and vendors. Among them are 25 shopkeepers, 175 stall vendors, and 20 native produce merchants. There are a total of 231 employees, with a circulating capital of 14,069 yuan. The vast majority of these small traders and vendors operate on a small scale, with 73.8 percent having capital of less than 50 yuan, and the most capitalized having only 800 yuan. Before market arrangements were made last year, the retail sales of small traders and vendors generally declined, and some employees experienced difficulties in life and their operating enthusiasm was low. At the same time, the supply and marketing cooperative experienced heavy retail business and overworked staff. As a result, it was inconvenient for the masses to buy things, often queuing, and some things could not be supplied. In October of last year, the local leading organs began to arrange for small traders and vendors. By December, a total of 187 small traders and vendors had been organized, including ten industries such as cloth, oil, salt, pork, general merchandise, restaurants, earthenware, loose wine, small food products, and native products. The number of households organized accounted for 85 percent of the total number of small traders and vendors in the town. The market presented a prosperous scene.

Before being organized, small traders and vendors generally felt that there was no way out and could not see the future. When they understood that they were working people and could take the road of mutual assistance and cooperation, they were very excited and said: Now my heart is bright, I have something to strive for, and I have hope. However, at the beginning of the organization, they still had many ideological concerns. Some were afraid of being unfree after being organized, and afraid that the funds would be collectivized. Those with little capital, many people, and weak labor were afraid that they would not be able to support their families with low wages. Those with large capital, few people, and strong labor were afraid that others would take advantage of them. The emergence of these ideological concerns shows that they still lack confidence in whether the road of mutual assistance and cooperation can be taken. In response to these ideological concerns, the local leading organs educated them on the benefits of being organized. By calculating business accounts and income accounts for them, it was explained that individual efforts are scattered, capital is small, and the masses do not trust them. After being organized, labor is used uniformly, there is more capital, the masses believe in them, and the leadership of the supply and marketing cooperative is strengthened, and the benefits will only increase and not decrease. After education, the awareness of small traders and vendors was improved, and they had a preliminary understanding of socialist transformation. On this basis, they were mobilized to carry out individual networking and organized according to the principle of voluntariness. The organizational form was determined according to the specific circumstances of each industry and each merchant, such as the amount of capital, the variety of goods, and the breadth of supply. Small food processing and copying industries (tofu, gaoba, etc.) have small capital and low income, and it is inconvenient to operate together, so they are organized into operating groups, with the supply and marketing cooperative uniformly supplying raw materials and decentralized operations. Small native general merchandise merchants with many and fragmented operating varieties organized distribution groups, and through contractual relationships, the supply and marketing cooperative supplied some goods (because the supply and marketing cooperative did not have some of the fragmented goods they sold), and decentralized operations. Small cloth, oil, and salt merchants who lacked funds to maintain operations formed consignment stores to sell goods for the supply and marketing cooperative and take commissions. Cloth, salt, and noodle restaurant industries with more capital and able to maintain operations organized cooperative groups, with the supply and marketing cooperative uniformly supplying goods. Among the native produce merchants, there are three situations: one is those with capital, who have contracts with the supply and marketing cooperative to purchase native produce and sell it to the supply and marketing cooperative, and operate individually; the other is those who lack capital and cannot maintain operations, who organize purchasing groups to purchase native produce for the supply and marketing cooperative and are responsible for transportation, and take commissions and freight; the third is the pork industry, which needs to supply a large amount of pork to cities and rural areas, but lacks capital. The supply and marketing cooperative invests some capital according to needs to participate in management and organize joint purchase and sales.

After being organized, because labor is divided into strong and weak physical strength and high and low skills, it is necessary to appropriately divide labor and implement the principle of mutual benefit. For example, in the pork industry, those with strong labor go out to buy pigs more, and those with weak labor sell pork at home more. The assessment of wages is higher for those with strong labor than those with weak labor, and higher for those with skills than those without skills.

After the small traders and vendors were organized, they established contact with the supply and marketing cooperative, and their sources of goods and funds were guaranteed, and their operating enthusiasm was greatly improved. Small cloth vendors who used to not go to the countryside to catch up with the market when the weather was bad now often go to the rural market to do business regardless of wind or rain. In order to meet the needs of farmers, the pasta industry has specially set up food stalls in the rural market. Native produce merchants not only go to the countryside to purchase native produce, but also help the supply and marketing cooperative bring agricultural tools to supply farmers. In the past, the pork industry only bought pigs in nearby areas due to lack of capital, but now they run farther and wider, which is convenient for farmers to sell pigs. Therefore, their turnover in January and February this year has increased compared with the same period last year. For example, the turnover of the cloth and salt industries has increased by more than double. In the four industries of cloth, salt, pork, and noodle restaurants, many households have invested the surplus of their income into operations, thus expanding operations.

    大关镇小商小贩是怎样组织起来的
    刘希　全铭
    贵州省黔西县大关镇靠近公路，运输便利，商业比较发达。全镇除供销合作社设有棉布、油盐、百货、米面、烟酒、生产资料六个门市部外，有小商小贩二百二十户。其中座商二十五户、摊贩一百七十五户、土产商二十户。共有从业人员二百三十一人，流动资金一万四千零六十九元。这些小商小贩绝大多数都是小本经营，资金不满五十元的占百分之七十三点八，本钱最多的只有八百元。在去年市场未安排以前，小商小贩的经营零售额普遍下降，一部分从业人员生活发生困难，经营情绪低落；同时，供销合作社则发生了零售业务繁重、工作人员忙不过来的现象。结果是群众买东西不方便，常常排队，有些东西得不到供应。去年十月，当地领导机关开始对小商小贩进行了安排，到十二月止共组织了小商小贩一百八十七户，其中包括了布、油、盐、猪肉、百杂货、饭馆、土陶器、零酒、小食品、土产等十个行业，组织起来的户数占全镇小商小贩总户数的百分之八十五。市场呈现了繁荣气象。
    在组织起来以前，小商小贩普遍感到没有出路，看不见前途；当他们了解自己是劳动人民，可以走互助合作的道路以后，他们都很兴奋，说：这一下心里亮堂了，有了奔头，有了指望了。但在开始进行组织时，他们仍然有许多思想顾虑。有的怕组织起来不自由，怕资金归公；资金少的，人口多的，劳动力弱的，怕工资拿的少不能养家糊口；资金大的、人口少的，劳动力强的，怕别人沾自己的光。这些思想顾虑的产生，说明他们对互助合作的道路是否能走得通还缺乏信心。当地领导机关针对这些思想顾虑，对他们进行了组织起来的好处的教育。通过给他们算营业账、收入账，说明单干力量分散，资本少，群众不信任；组织起来后，劳力统一使用，资金多，群众相信，而且供销合作社对他们的领导加强了，收益只会增多不会减少。经过教育，小商小贩的觉悟提高了，对社会主义改造有了初步认识。在这一基础上，发动他们自己进行个别串连，根据自愿原则进行组织。组织形式是根据各行业、各商户资金多寡、经营品种多少、货源宽窄等具体情况来确定的。加工复制的小食品业（豆腐、糕粑等）本钱小、收入少，合起来经营不方便，便组织经营小组，集体订计划，由供销合作社统一供应原料，分散经营。经营品种多而零碎的小土百货商组织了经销小组，通过合同关系，由供销合作社供给部分货物（因为他们卖的某些零碎货物供销合作社没有），分散经营。缺少资金不能维持经营的布、油、盐业小商户，组成代销店，给供销社代卖商品，取手续费。资金较多，能维持经营的布、盐、面馆业组织了合作小组，由供销合作社统一供应货源。在土产商当中有三种情况：一种是有资金的，同供销合作社订有合同，收购土产卖给供销合作社，个别经营；一种是缺乏资金，不能维持经营的，组织了代购小组，代供销合作社收购土产并负责运输，取手续费和运费；一种是猪肉业，城市和农村都需要他们大量供应猪肉，但资金不足，供销合作社根据需要投入部分资金参加管理，组织联购联销。
    组织起来以后，因劳动力有体力强弱和技术高低之分，所以必须适当分工，贯彻互利原则。如猪肉业，劳动力强的，多到外面买猪，劳动力弱的多在家里卖猪肉。工资的评定，劳力强的高于弱的，有技术的高于无技术的。
    小商小贩组织起来以后，同供销合作社建立了联系，货源、资金都有了保证，经营情绪大大提高了。经营布业的小商贩，以前遇到天气不好就不下乡赶集，现在不管刮风下雨，经常到乡场营业。面食业为了适应农民需要，专门在乡场上设了饭摊。土产商不光下乡收购土产，还帮供销社带农具供应农民。猪肉业过去因本钱少只在附近地区买猪，现时跑的又远又宽，便利了农民卖猪。因此，他们今年一、二月份的营业额比去年同期都有了提高，如布业、盐业的营业额就增加了一倍以上。布、盐、猪肉、面馆等四个行业中，很多户把收入的节余投入了营业，因而营业也扩大了。
