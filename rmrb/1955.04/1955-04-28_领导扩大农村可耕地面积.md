    Leaders Expand Rural Cultivated Land Area
      The Dongshijing Township in Hejian County, Hebei Province, has a total of 14,500 mu of land, but the actual cultivated land is only more than 13,000 mu. The township branch analyzed and studied the reasons for these abandoned lands and found that 350 mu were alkaline land, more than 300 mu were sandy wasteland, and more than 400 mu were close to pear trees, so farmers were afraid of affecting the growth of the pear trees and did not dare to cultivate them; there were also more than 300 mu scattered in ditches, slopes, cemeteries, and other scattered plots. To this end, the branch committee conducted a specific study and proposed some reasonable ways to use these lands. For example, hemp can be planted on scattered plots, so more than 300 mu of land can yield 18,000 jin of hemp seeds. After such careful research, the branch committee then educated all party members and Youth League members on utilizing wasteland and increasing income; in particular, they used the facts that party member Zhang Dafu planted red osier on alkaline mounds to increase income, and that the masses, like Li Zhenhai, transformed 1.3 mu of sandy wasteland and harvested 8,000 jin of radishes to educate party and league members, so that everyone realized that as long as they planted according to the nature of the land, they could get a harvest. Then, the branch called on party members and Youth League members to lead agricultural cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers to plan to plant hemp seeds, sunflowers, melons, vegetables, artemisia and other crops according to local conditions. At present, under the leadership of party members and Youth League members, the masses in the whole township are整治[rectifying] wastelands such as sandy and alkaline lands to ensure timely planting.

    领导扩大农村可耕地面积
      河北省河间县东诗经村乡，全乡共有土地一万四千五百亩，但实耕地只有一万三千多亩。这个乡的支部分析研究了这些土地被废弃的原因，发现有三百五十亩是碱地，有三百多亩地是沙荒，有四百多亩地靠近梨树，农民怕影响梨树的成长，不敢耕种；还有三百多亩地是分散在沟、坡、坟场等零星地头。为此，支部委员会作了一次具体的研究，提出了一些合理使用这些土地的办法。例如零星地头可以种上大麻，那末三百多亩地就可以收一万八千斤大麻籽。经过这样仔细研究，支部委员就又向全体党员和青年团员进行了利用废地、增加收入的教育；特别用了党员张大符在碱垅子上种红荆子，增加收入，群众李振海改造一亩三分沙荒地，收了八千斤萝卜的事实教育党、团员，使大家认识到，只要根据土地的性质来种植，就能得到收获。接着，支部就号召党、团员带动农业社、互助组和个体农民，分别计划因地种植大麻籽、向日葵、瓜菜、蒿子等作物。目前，全乡的群众在党、团员带动下，正在整治沙、碱等废地，保证按时种植。
