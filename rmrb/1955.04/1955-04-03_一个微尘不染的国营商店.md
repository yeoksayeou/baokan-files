    A Spotlessly Clean State-Owned Store

    In the Nangang Department Store of the China National Qiulin Company in Harbin, although thousands of customers go in and out every day, it always leaves customers with a clean and beautiful impression. The goods displayed on the counters are always clean, and the doors, windows, walls, ceilings, and floors are always spotless and shiny. Even in the electrical appliances and hardware department, there is no messy placement of goods. It is noteworthy that the "scales" for weighing food are equipped with dust-proof white cloth covers. An hour before the start of business each day, hundreds of salespersons wipe all the equipment and goods that can be wiped within their assigned areas. Woolen fabrics and cloths are also swept with brushes to remove dust. The floor of the store is swept four times a day with damp sawdust, and spitting and littering are strictly prohibited. The personal hygiene of the salespersons is also very strict. The white work clothes must be washed two or three times a week. Before starting work, they wash their hands with soap and disinfectant. Bathing, haircuts, and nail trimming are also regulated. The food department also holds a hygiene knowledge lecture once a week. Because all the salespersons strictly implement the store's hygiene system and maintain the cleanliness of the store at all times, they have increased the pleasant impression on customers and won the praise of the majority of customers, and therefore were rated as a model unit for hygiene work in Harbin in 1954.

    一个微尘不染的国营商店
    在哈尔滨市中国国营秋林公司哈尔滨市南岗百货商店里，每天虽然有成千上百的顾客进进出出，但这里任何时候都给顾客留下了清洁美观的印象。在柜台上陈列的商品总是干干净净，门窗、四壁、天棚、地板，经常一尘不染，光光亮亮。就是走到电器五金部，也看不到商品乱放的现象。惹人注意的是称食品的“秤”都设有防尘白布罩。每天营业开始前一小时，数百名营业员在划分的范围内，将凡是可以擦拭的设备和商品都擦一遍。呢绒和布疋，也用毛刷子扫去微尘。商店的地板每天要用湿锯末子扫四次，并严禁随地吐痰和乱扔污物。营业员的个人卫生也非常严格，白色的工作服每周必须洗二、三次，工作开始前都用肥皂和药水洗手消毒，洗澡、理发、剪指甲也都定了制度。食品部每周还要举办一次卫生知识讲座。由于全体营业员严格执行了商店的卫生制度，每时每刻保持了商店的整洁，给顾客增加了愉快的印象，获得了广大顾客的赞扬，因而被评为一九五四年哈尔滨市卫生工作模范单位。
