    Our Great Motherland
    With strong support from the state, farmers in Heilongjiang Province have been engaged in spring plowing. In the Second District of Suihua County, in addition to the eighty sets of new-style animal-drawn farm implements already in use, sixty more sets of new-style animal-drawn farm implements have been added this year. This is a scene of members of the Third Agricultural Producers' Cooperative pulling the new-style animal-drawn farm implements lent by the state to the fields, preparing for sowing.
