The large-scale purchase of pigs with stuffed bellies, resulting in weight reduction losses, is a serious problem that has long existed in the state-owned commercial and cooperative commercial pork business. Some farmers, in order to increase the weight of their pigs and sell them for more money, often feed their pigs a lot before selling them. Some first feed them salt to stimulate their appetite, and then feed them feeds that are not easily digested. Some even mix in gypsum powder, mud, sand, and gravel. Compared with ordinary pigs, pigs with stuffed bellies often have a weight reduction rate of about 15%, and some even reach more than 20%. According to the food purchasing departments in Nangong, Xinhe, Neiqiu and other counties in Hebei Province, the average weight reduction of each purchased pig with a stuffed belly is 21 jin, and the maximum is 51 jin. The situation in other regions is basically the same.

The loss caused to the state by purchasing pigs with stuffed bellies is very large. In addition, some pigs are affected by excessive appetite and even die from bloating. The Hunan Provincial Food Company once dissected three pigs that died shortly after being purchased without any disease and found that their intestines and stomachs were full of half-cooked rice and raw bran mixed with salt and gypsum powder, and the duodenum was hardened. This practice often results in losses for pig farmers as well. For example, Dai Jintang, a farmer in Changlun Township, Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, fed his pig too much and drove it to the cooperative to sell it, but the pig died of bloating on the way. Farmers in other regions have had similar results because they fed their pigs too much. At the same time, because it is profitable to sell pigs with stuffed bellies, it also directly affects the enthusiasm of the majority of farmers to raise fattened pigs.

Selling pigs with stuffed bellies is partly a bad habit left over from the old society; on the other hand, it is because the food purchasing departments in many areas only use weight as the standard for purchasing pigs and adopt a price policy that the heavier the pig, the higher the price. Although some areas also stipulate the acquisition of flat-bellied pigs in the specification standards, there is no clear boundary between "flat belly" and "stuffed belly." Some purchasers in state-owned commerce and cooperatives, in order to complete the purchase tasks, only pay attention to quantity and not quality. Some comrades from the Kedong County Food Company in Heilongjiang Province said: We will collect any pig as long as we can complete the task, regardless of whether it is big or small. In order to buy more pigs, some also vigorously promote the purchase of pigs with stuffed bellies. For example, the An'yi County Food Company in Jiangxi Province posted advertisements everywhere saying, "The cooperative does not accept pigs with stuffed bellies, but we accept them as soon as they arrive, even if they are stuffed!" The purchasers of the Qiaoxu District Cooperative in Guixian County, Guangxi Province, often go deep into every village and household to promote: "Hurry up and feed the pigs! Feed them well so I can weigh them." As a result, farmers are encouraged to feed pigs with stuffed bellies.

To eliminate the bad habit of farmers selling pigs with stuffed bellies, the most important key is to educate farmers. In particular, according to the different situations in various regions, we should carry out extensive publicity and education work for farmers with real people and real things. Farmers must understand that the state helps farmers develop the pig-raising industry in all aspects, guaranteeing the legitimate interests of pig raising. Selling pigs with stuffed bellies to cooperatives and food companies to obtain excessive profits not only directly harms the interests of the state, but is also detrimental to themselves. In early February, the Chaling Transfer Station of the Hunan Provincial Food Company, under the leadership of the local Party and government, used various forms to explain to farmers the harm of feeding pigs with stuffed bellies to the state and themselves. Based on the farmers' self-reported sales dates, it organized regular sales through the township economic committees and promptly commended farmers who sold flat-bellied pigs, so that the weight reduction rate of purchased pigs was significantly reduced. The weight reduction rate of many townships selling pigs is mostly below 5%, while the weight reduction rate of pigs purchased by the "kao cao" method in the past was more than 10%. This new method is widely welcomed by farmers. At a forum for pig sellers held by the Chaling Transfer Station on February 13, farmer Tan Sizai said: "Selling pigs regularly, weighing them when they arrive, does not delay production or starve the pigs." Many people at the meeting said that they would publicize to relatives and neighbors that it is good for the country and themselves not to feed the pigs too much when selling them. Xiangyin County in Hunan Province and Songbu and Tuanfeng in Hubei Province have also achieved good results using this method. The Fushan County Cooperative in Shandong Province promoted while purchasing. The vast majority of the batches of pigs collected in early February and early March were flat-bellied pigs, and the average weight reduction rate after being transported to Qingdao was only about 5%.

Of course, simply relying on publicity and education is not enough. State-owned commercial departments must also promptly study and revise the current purchase specification standards so that they meet the current quality of live pigs, can be readily accepted by the masses of farmers, and are easy to master, so as to correctly implement the state's price policy of "taking care of the interests of production, transportation, sales and consumers, and encouraging variety improvement and fattening of pigs." The method of purchasing and pricing only according to gross weight should be changed, and the method of purchasing and pricing should be implemented according to how much net meat can be produced.

The correct implementation of specification standards also depends on the service attitude and technical level of the purchasers. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the education of purchasers, overcome the erroneous practice of only paying attention to quantity and not quality, and strictly require the correct mastery of specification standards. In addition, because there is currently no set of scientific instruments to determine the quality of live pigs, and everything depends on experience and estimation, it is necessary to do a good job in technical education to improve the technical level of purchasers and enrich the experience of estimating quality.

    如何扭转收购饱肚猪现象
    杨树春
    大量收购饱肚猪造成减量损失，是国营商业和合作社商业在猪肉经营中长期存在的一个严重问题。有些农民，为了使猪增加重量，多卖些钱，常在卖猪前把猪喂得很饱，有的先喂盐来刺激猪的食欲，然后再喂不容易消化的饲料，有的甚至掺喂石膏粉和泥沙、碎石等。饱肚猪与一般平肚猪比较，减量率常在百分之十五左右，有的甚至高达百分之二十以上。据食品收购部门在河北省南宫、新河、内邱等县的了解和统计，所收购的饱肚猪每头平均减量二十一斤，最多的是五十一斤。其他地区的情况也基本相同。
    收购饱肚猪给国家造成的损失是很大的。此外，有些猪因为旺食过饱而影响健康，甚至涨死；湖南省食品公司曾经解剖过三头买进不久就无病而死的猪，发现肠胃里都是拌了盐和石膏粉的半熟的大米和生糠，十二指肠部分硬化。而这样作的结果，也常使养猪农民受到损失，如湖南省湘阴县长仑乡农民戴金堂，把猪喂得过饱后赶到合作社去卖，结果猪在半路上涨死了。其他地区的农民因把猪喂得过饱，都有同样的结果。同时因为卖饱肚猪有利可图，也直接影响广大农民喂肥猪的积极性。
    卖饱肚猪一方面是旧社会遗留下来的恶习；另一方面是很多地区的食品收购部门只以重量作为收购猪的标准，并采取猪愈重价钱愈高的价格政策所致。有些地区虽然在规格标准中也规定了收购平肚猪的一条，但“平肚”和“饱肚”之间并没有明确的界限。国营商业和合作社的一些收购人员，为了完成收购任务，也重量不重质。黑龙江省克东县食品公司有些同志就说：有猪就收，好歹完成任务，管什么大肚不大肚。为了买到更多的猪，有的还大张旗鼓地宣传买饱肚猪。如江西省安义县食品公司到处张贴“合作社不收饱肚猪，我们是随到随收，饱肚也收”的广告；广西省贵县桥墟区合作社的收购员们，常常深入每村每户，去宣传：“赶快喂猪吧，喂饱了我好称”。结果更助长了农民喂饱肚猪。
    要消除农民卖饱肚猪的恶习，首要的关键是教育农民。特别是应该根据各地的不同情况，以真人真事，对农民进行广泛的宣传教育工作。要使农民懂得：国家从各方面帮助农民发展养猪事业，保证了养猪的正当利益。把饱肚猪卖给合作社和食品公司而获取暴利，不仅直接危害国家利益，对自己也是不利的。湖南省食品公司茶陵接运站，二月初在当地党和政府的领导下，利用各种形式向农民说明喂饱肚猪对国家对自己都有害的道理，根据农民自报的出售日期，通过乡经济委员组织定期送售，并及时表扬送售平肚猪的农民，使购进的猪减量率显著降低。很多乡送售猪的减量率大都在百分之五以下，而过去用“考槽”办法收进的猪，减量率则在百分之十以上。这个新办法受到农民的普遍欢迎，在二月十三日茶陵接运站召开的送猪户座谈会上，农民谭四仔说：“定期送猪，送到就秤，既不耽误生产，又不饿肚子。”许多人在会上都表示要向亲友邻居宣传，卖猪时不喂饱槽，对国家对自己都有好处。湖南省湘阴县和湖北省的宋埠、团风等地利用这一办法也都获得良好的效果。山东省福山县合作社，边收购、边宣传，二月初和三月初收进的几批猪绝大部分都是平肚猪，运到青岛后的减量率平均只在百分之五左右。
    当然，单纯依靠宣传教育是不够的，国营商业部门还必须从速研究修订现行的收购规格标准，使它切合现在的生猪质量，能为农民群众乐意接受，并易于掌握，以便正确地贯彻国家“照顾生产、运销和消费者的利益，鼓励品种改良和饲育肥猪”的价格政策。应该改变只按毛重收购和作价的方法，实行按能出净肉多少就给多少价钱的收购和作价方法。
    规格标准的正确执行还决定于收购人员的服务态度和技术水平。因此，必须加强对收购人员的教育，克服只顾数量不管质量的错误做法，严格要求正确掌握规格标准。另外，因为目前判定生猪质量尚无一套科学仪器，全凭经验估看，这就必须做好技术教育工作，以提高收购人员的技术水平，充实估看质量的经验。
