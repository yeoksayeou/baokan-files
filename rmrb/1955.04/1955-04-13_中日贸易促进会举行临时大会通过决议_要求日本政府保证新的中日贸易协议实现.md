Xinhua News Agency, Osaka, April 12th. According to a report in the Osaka "Asahi Shimbun" on the 12th, the China-Japan Trade Promotion Association held an extraordinary general meeting in Tokyo on the 11th, attended by 78 companies, to discuss issues related to the signing of a new China-Japan trade agreement. The meeting passed a resolution demanding that the Japanese government take appropriate measures to guarantee the implementation of the new agreement. This resolution has been submitted to the Japanese government and the Diet.

The resolution stated: We in the business community engaged in Japan-China trade are very concerned about the signing of this new trade agreement. In order for this agreement to be a step forward from the first and second China-Japan trade agreements, a new condition is needed, and that is the cooperation of the Japanese government.

The resolution pointed out that, up to now, private enterprises have worked hard to overcome many difficulties and have achieved certain results in order to expand Japan-China trade, but in order for Japan-China trade to achieve further development, government cooperation is essential.

The resolution demanded that the Japanese government take the initiative to consult with the Chinese trade delegation, participate in the formulation of trade plans, guarantee the implementation of the trade payment agreement, express sincerity in the mutual establishment of trade delegations between China and Japan, and enrich the new China-Japan trade agreement to ensure its implementation.

    新华社大阪十二日电　据大阪“朝日新闻”十二日报道，中日贸易促进会十一日在东京举行有七十八个公司参加的临时大会，讨论了有关签订新的中日贸易协议的问题。大会通过了一项决议，要求日本政府采取适当的措施，以保证新的协议的实现。这一决议已向日本政府和国会提出。
    决议说：我们从事于日中贸易的企业界，对这次签订新的贸易协议非常关切。为了使这次协议能够比第一次和第二次所签订的中日贸易协议前进一步，需要有一个新的条件，这就是日本政府的合作。
    决议指出，到目前为止，民间企业为了扩大日中贸易，曾经努力克服了不少困难，取得了一定的成果，但是为了使日中贸易获得进一步的发展，必须要有政府方面的合作。
    决议要求日本政府主动地和中国贸易代表团进行协商，参加贸易计划的制定，保证履行贸易支付协定，对中日两国互设贸易代表团表示诚意，并充实新的中日贸易协议，保证它的实现。
