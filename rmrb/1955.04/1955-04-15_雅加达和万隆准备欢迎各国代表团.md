Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 14th: Preparations for the Asian-African Conference are nearing completion. The Joint Secretariat, responsible for the conference preparations, inspected every detail of the preparations at a routine meeting held in Bandung on the 13th. The Indonesian government and people, along with the Joint Secretariat responsible for the conference preparations, are continuing their intensive activities to make specific and final arrangements for the arrival of delegations from twenty-nine countries and the timely convening of the Asian-African Conference.

　　To welcome the arrival of delegations from various countries, bright slogans such as "Warmly Welcome the Delegates Participating in the Asian-African Conference" can be seen everywhere on the streets, trams, buses, and other trucks in Bandung and Jakarta. The slogans also emphasized the conference's goals of striving for peace, cooperation, and friendship. Large maps indicating the locations of the twenty-nine participating countries are posted everywhere. Flagpoles ready to hoist the national flags of the twenty-nine countries have been erected at the airport and at the main conference building in Bandung. In Bandung, the two main hotels accommodating the delegates—the Savoy Homann Hotel and the Preanger Hotel—have also been renovated and repainted.

　　In the "Gedung Dwi Warna" (Peace Goddess Building) and the "Gedung Dana Pensiun" (Pension Fund Building), which serve as the main conference venues, all the necessary equipment for the conference has been installed, and workers and engineers are now racing against time to make these two buildings even more perfect. The part of the "Gedung Dwi Warna" that was destroyed during the war has now been completely rebuilt and has become a huge press room for journalists.

　　The streets of Bandung have been repaired and cleaned. Approximately 1,500 new telephone sets have been installed to provide delegates, journalists, and staff with short-distance and long-distance telephone services during the conference.

　　About eighty Indonesian parties and organizations have formed a "People's Committee" to welcome the convening of the Asian-African Conference. Representatives from parties and organizations such as the Indonesian Nationalist Party, the Communist Party of Indonesia, the Indonesian Islamic Union Party, and the Bandung Student Association are participating in this committee.
