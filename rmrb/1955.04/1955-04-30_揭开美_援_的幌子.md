Unmasking the Pretext of American "Aid"
Li Gao

On April 20th, U.S. President Eisenhower submitted to Congress a message regarding the "Mutual Security Assistance" plan for the fiscal year 1956. This message demonstrates that the main purpose of the U.S.'s so-called "aid" plan for fiscal year 1956 is to intensify the policy of waging war "with Asians fighting Asians" and to expand American colonialist plunder in Asia.

Eisenhower announced in the message that the focus of U.S. "aid" has shifted to Asia, and that the "vast majority" of the so-called "mutual security assistance" funds will be used in the "arc" extending from South Korea and Japan to the Middle East. More than a year ago, U.S. Vice President Nixon suggested to the U.S. "National Security Council" the establishment of an "arc-shaped military defense line" from the Middle East to Japan in an attempt to encircle China and the Soviet Union. Earlier this year, U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford also threatened that the U.S. would "implement a very large military aid plan in the Far East" and suggested to Eisenhower that "the United States must be prepared—materially and spiritually—to fight small wars on the edge of the bamboo curtain." The U.S. "aid" plan is a preparatory step for implementing the U.S. imperialists' plan to launch new wars in Asia.

The figures for the allocation of "aid" funds in the U.S. President's message also confirm this. Of the total amount of $3.53 billion, $2.7175 billion, accounting for more than 77 percent of the total, is earmarked for military projects such as "defense support," "direct military assistance," and "direct troop support." According to Eisenhower's explanation when he presented the budget in January this year, the "military assistance" in fiscal year 1956 will be used to "further help" America's "allies complete the equipment and training of troops equivalent to 180 divisions, 511 combat vessels, 278 air squadrons, and related support units."

As everyone knows, Asian countries are working to enhance friendly cooperation with each other and strive for peace. The recent Asian-African Conference showed that Asian and African countries want to maintain and consolidate peace. In the joint communique, the participating countries unanimously stated that all countries should cooperate to promote disarmament and eliminate nuclear weapons. However, the purpose of U.S. "aid" is precisely the opposite of this common aspiration of Asian and African countries. It seeks to drive certain Asian countries to intensify their arms expansion and war preparations, create an atmosphere of division, opposition, and mutual distrust among Asian countries, and create tense situations and war crises.

Disregarding the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the U.S. President openly stated that he would "provide (South) Korea with military equipment and supplies." He also specifically mentioned that "substantial funds" would be used to "maintain and improve" the army of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. U.S. military personnel—including warmongers such as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford—have recently flocked to Taiwan to directly plan war deployments. In Tokyo, the U.S. is forcing Japan to substantially increase its military spending for this year and next year. In Southeast Asia, the military staff personnel of the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" cobbled together by the U.S. are holding a meeting in Baguio. According to the Associated Press, this meeting is to plan the establishment of an "eight-nation army" and an air base network to serve the U.S. aggression policy. Regarding the Middle East, Eisenhower stated that he would use greater strength to "support" the Turkey-Iraq military treaty, which is splitting Arab countries and increasing the war crisis in the Middle East.

The U.S. aggressive clique believes that "using Asians to fight Asians" is necessary and cost-effective for the U.S. to wage war in the Far East. Van Fleet openly promoted in the February issue of "Reader's Digest" magazine last year that if the U.S. wants to launch an Asian war, it needs "one hundred well-trained and well-equipped divisions." If the "old method" of using U.S. troops to fight as in Korea is followed, "it would require two million soldiers and cost $25 billion annually"; but if Asians are trained and equipped to fight, the cost would only be "one-twenty-fifth," "not even counting the human lives." This is the calculation of the Wall Street bosses. No wonder the U.S. propaganda machine is vigorously promoting the U.S.'s large-scale "aid" plan to Asia.

Facts also prove that along with U.S. "military aid" comes the heavy yoke of military burden, making the recipient countries increasingly subject to U.S. dictates. Eisenhower emphasized that "the primary responsibility must be borne by those countries themselves." Eisenhower admitted that Greece and Turkey, the earliest recipients of U.S. "aid" and praised by him as "loyal NATO allies," currently have "huge armed forces" stipulated for them by the North Atlantic Group, which they cannot support with their own capabilities. However, according to the U.S. plan, no matter how impoverished these countries become due to military preparations, they must continue to squeeze the people's wealth to bear the "responsibility" of arms expansion and war preparations imposed on them by U.S. "aid."

In order to conceal the U.S.'s war purposes and facilitate the selling of the U.S.'s aggression plan to Asian countries, the U.S. has included items such as "technical cooperation" and "development assistance" totaling more than $500 million in its "aid" plan. This amount is insignificant compared to military spending. But even this so-called "economic assistance" is used to achieve greedy colonialist purposes. The U.S. President's message states that U.S. "economic assistance" focuses on "developing" the "rich resources and fertile land" of countries in the Asian arc. The message uses the word "cooperation" to conceal the nature of this U.S. "development" as colonial plunder. But when the message cites the "technical cooperation" between the U.S. and Latin American countries to boast about the "noble value" of the U.S.'s "cooperation," people have a more accurate understanding of the "cooperation" promised by the U.S. President to Asian countries. Regarding this kind of "cooperation" by the U.S., the "Argentine Democratic Newspaper" once wrote: "The rampant expansion of the U.S. and the increasing imperialist tendency in U.S. policy are first manifested in the exploitation of Latin American countries, in creating disturbances in the political structures of these countries, in using force to compel the governments of these countries to obey the U.S., in binding the governments of these countries with debts, in hindering the economic development of Latin America and obstructing their industrialization, making Latin America permanently trapped in a state of poverty, thereby turning them into suppliers of docile and cheap labor—this is the whole picture of the 'cooperation' that the U.S. has implemented for sixty-two years."

The U.S. President's message also blatantly states: "Based on the experience of the past two years, for every four dollars of all common security plan appropriations, three dollars are immediately used to purchase goods, labor, machinery, and other goods in the United States... This includes the large-scale export of major surplus agricultural products." This actually means that the so-called "aid" provided by the U.S. is a means to help the U.S. dump "surplus" commodities in large quantities and shift its economic crisis.

These are the imperialist essence of U.S. "aid."

The Asian-African Conference has shown that Asian and African countries do not reject foreign aid, but this must be economic cooperation on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and respect for national sovereignty, and it must be conducive to the development of independent and autonomous economies in various countries. The "aid plan" promoted by the U.S. conflicts with this. The U.S. uses U.S. "aid" to cover up colonialist expansion, hinder Asian and African countries from developing independent economies and their mutually beneficial economic cooperation on an equal footing, and make them vassals of the U.S. The Asian and African people see through the colonialist intentions hidden behind the U.S.'s guise of "aid."

    揭开美“援”的幌子
    李高
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在四月二十日向国会提出了关于一九五六年度“共同安全援助”计划的咨文。这个咨文表明，一九五六年度的美国所谓“援助”计划，主要目的是在加紧推行“以亚洲人打亚洲人”的战争政策和扩大美国在亚洲的殖民主义掠夺。
    艾森豪威尔在咨文中宣布，美国“援”外的重点转移到了亚洲，所谓“共同安全援助”款项，“绝大部分”将用在从南朝鲜、日本延伸到中东的“弧形地带”。早在一年多之前，美国副总统尼克松就向美国“国家安全委员会”建议要建立一个从中东到日本的“弧形军事防线”，以图把中国和苏联包围起来。今年年初，美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福也扬言美国要“在远东实施一个规模非常大的军事援助计划”，并且向艾森豪威尔提出：“美国必须准备好——在物资上和精神上——在竹幕边缘打小型战争”。美国的“援助”计划，就是实施美帝国主义在亚洲发动新战争的计划的一个准备步骤。
    美国总统咨文中关于“援助”款项的分配数字也证实了这一点。在总数三十五亿三千万美元中，规定用于所谓“防御支持”、“直接军事援助”和“直接部队支持”等军事项目的共达二十七亿一千七百五十万美元，占总数的百分之七十七强。根据今年一月艾森豪威尔在提出预算案时的说明，一九五六年度的“军事援助”将用来“进一步帮助”美国的“盟国完成装备和训练相当于一百八十个师、五百十一艘战斗舰艇、二百七十八个空军中队和有关支援部队的军队。”
    大家知道，亚洲各国正在为增进彼此的友好合作和争取和平而努力。最近的亚非会议表明，亚非国家要维持和巩固和平。参加会议各国在联合公报中一致地表示：一切国家都应当合作，促成裁减军备和消除核子武器。但是，美国“援助”的目的却恰恰同亚非国家的这种共同愿望相反。它要驱使某些亚洲国家加紧扩军备战，在亚洲国家中间制造分裂、对立和互不信任的气氛，造成紧张局势和战争危机。
    美国总统不顾朝鲜停战协定的规定，公然表示要“为（南）朝鲜提供军事装备和军需品”。他又特别提到要用“大量费用”来“维持和改善”蒋介石卖国集团的军队，美国的军事人员——包括参谋长联席会议主席雷德福等好战分子——最近纷纷跑到台湾去直接策划战争的部署。在东京，美国正在迫使日本大量增加本年度和下一年度的军事费用。在东南亚，美国拼凑起来的“东南亚条约组织”的军事参谋人员正在碧瑶举行会议。据合众社透露，这个会议要策划建立为美国侵略政策服务的一支“八国军队”和一个空军基地网。对中东，艾森豪威尔表示要以更大的力量来“支持”分裂阿拉伯国家、增加中东战争危机的土耳其—伊拉克军事条约。
    美国侵略集团认为，“以亚洲人打亚洲人”对美国在远东进行战争是必需和合算的。范佛里特在去年二月号的“读者文摘”杂志上公开宣传说：美国要发动亚洲大战，需要“一百个训练装备皆佳的师”，如果照在朝鲜的“老办法”用美国军队去打，“便得用两百万兵员，每年耗费二百五十亿美元”；可是如果训练和装备亚洲人来打，费用只要
  “二十五分之一”，“还没有把人命计算在内”。这就是华尔街老板们的算盘，难怪美国宣传机器大事宣扬美国大规模“援助”亚洲的计划了。
    事实还证明，随着美国“军事援助”而来的，就是沉重的军事负担的枷锁，并使受“援”国越来越听凭美国的驱使。艾森豪威尔强调说：“主要的责任必须由那些国家自己来负。”艾森豪威尔承认，最早接受美国“援助”并被他称赞为“忠实的北大西洋公约组织盟国”的希腊和土耳其，目前都有着北大西洋集团为它们规定的“庞大武装部队”，为它们的能力所不能支持。可是，按照美国的计划，不管这些国家为军备而弄得怎么民穷财尽，也得继续搜括人民的膏脂来负起美“援”所加给它们的扩军备战的“责任”。
    为了掩饰美国的战争目的并便于向亚洲国家兜售美国的侵略计划，美国在它的“援助”计划中列入了所谓“技术合作”和“开发援助”等款项共五亿余美元。这个款项在数目上比起军事费用来是微不足道的。但是即使这种被美其名为“经济援助”的也是用来达到殖民主义的贪婪目的。美国总统的咨文说明，美国的“经济援助”着眼于“开发”亚洲弧形地带各国的“丰富的资源和肥沃的土地”。咨文用“合作”的字眼来掩饰美国这种“开发”的殖民掠夺性质。但是当咨文举出美国同拉丁美洲国家之间的“技术合作”来吹嘘美国的“合作”的
  “高贵价值”时，人们对美国总统许诺给亚洲国家的“合作”就有较确切的了解了。关于美国的这种“合作”，“阿根廷民主报”曾经写道：“美国的猖狂扩张和美国政策中日益加甚的帝国主义倾向，首先表现在对拉丁美洲各国的剥削方面，表现在在这些国家的政治结构中制造变乱，表现在用武力强迫这些国家的政府服从美国，表现在用债务来束缚这些国家的政府，表现在阻碍拉丁美洲的经济发展和妨碍它们的工业化，使拉丁美洲永远陷于贫困的状态中，从而使它们变成温驯而廉价的劳动力的供应者——这是美国六十二年来所实行的‘合作’的全部情况。”
    美国总统咨文中还赤裸裸地说：“根据过去两年的经验，全部共同安全计划拨款的每四块美元中，就有三块美元是立即用来在美国购买商品、劳务、机器和其他货物。……这包括主要剩余农作物的大量输出。”这实际上就是说，美国提供的所谓“援助”，是帮助美国大量倾销“剩余”商品、转嫁经济危机的一个手段。
    这些就是美国“援助”的帝国主义本质。
    亚非会议已表明，亚非国家并不排斥外援，但这必须是在平等互利和尊重国家主权的基础上的经济合作，并且有助于各国独立自主经济的发展。美国宣传的“援助计划”却是同这一点相冲突的。美国用美“援”来掩护殖民主义扩张，阻挠亚非国家发展独立的经济和它们相互间的平等互利的经济合作，使它们成为美国的附庸。亚非人民是看穿了美国在“援助”的幌子后隐藏着的殖民主义打算的。
