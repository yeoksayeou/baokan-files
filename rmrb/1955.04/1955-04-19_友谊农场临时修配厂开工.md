    Friendship Farm's Temporary Repair Shop Opens
    The temporary repair shop of the state-owned Friendship Farm has started production in Kangjiadian on the prairie. From March 26th to now, this repair shop has repaired and manufactured more than 250 various machine parts.
    The basic equipment of the state-owned Friendship Farm repair shop, including the power station, laboratory, and equipment for seven or eight workshops such as lathe, forge, welder, fitter, and assembly shops, was entirely donated by the Soviet people. Such a repair shop can serve four hundred standard tractors (15 horsepower each). This autumn, this repair shop will be built together with the farm's general headquarters in Sandaogang. The temporary repair shop now located in Kangjiadian already has a small power station and four workshops for sand turning, lathe work, electric welding, etc., and two mobile repair vehicles.

    友谊农场临时修配厂开工
    国营友谊农场的临时修配厂已在草原上的康家店开工生产了。这个修配厂从三月二十六日到现在，已修理和配制了各种机器零件二百五十多件。
    国营友谊农场修配厂的基本设备，包括发电站、实验室和车工、锻工、焊工、钳工、装配等七、八个车间的设备，完全是苏联人民赠送的。这样的一个修配厂，可以为四百标准台拖拉机（每台十五马力）服务。今年秋天，这个修配厂将和农场总场部一起，在三道岗建设起来。现在设立在康家店的临时修配厂，已经有一个小型发电站和翻沙、车工、电焊等四个车间，另外有两台流动修理车。（新华社）
