Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 31st (TASS): "L'Humanité" published a statement by the French Communist Party on March 29th, which emphasized that the French parliament's approval of the Paris Agreements is a political act that poses a serious threat to peace and French security. The statement said: "This action is a betrayal of the true interests of the motherland by the representatives of the French big bourgeoisie, and a temporary success of the pressure exerted by the British and American ruling circles to insult our national honor. Arming West Germany means, first and foremost, increasing the danger of war, because arming West Germany means deepening the division of Germany and giving an army to German revanchists, who have always harbored political and territorial ambitions against both East and West.

The government and the government majority in parliament signed the London and Paris Agreements, which means canceling the best guarantee of France's security and independence—the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance signed in December 1944. They have subjected our country to the combined pressure of American, British, and German imperialists. Implementing the Paris Agreements will cause France to lose its status as a major power, which is already in question. Therefore, the ratification of the London and Paris Agreements is clearly in conflict with national interests and the openly expressed will of our people. This once again confirms that, among the leading figures of the French bourgeoisie, class egoism outweighs patriotism.”

The French Communist Party pointed out that the implementation of the Paris Agreements will lead to military expansion and the deterioration of the living conditions of the French working people. The French Communist Party declared: The French people will never agree to a policy of war and betrayal of national interests, and the French people will never allow themselves to be dragged into a war against the Soviet Union.

The statement also said that the responsibility of the Communists now is to strengthen the united action of the working class and unite all patriotic and democratic forces to launch a mass struggle against the implementation of the Paris Agreements, against the preparation of atomic war, to safeguard the interests of the working class and all working people, and to defend democratic freedoms.

    法国共产党就议会批准巴黎协定发表声明
    号召加强团结反对实现巴黎协定
    新华社三十一日讯　塔斯社巴黎三十日讯：“人道报”三月二十九日刊载了法国共产党的声明，声明中着重指出，法国议会批准巴黎协定是对和平和法国安全造成严重威胁的政治行动。声明说：“这一行动是法国大资产阶级的代表对祖国真正利益的出卖，是英国和美国统治集团所施行的侮辱我们民族荣誉的压力的暂时的成功。武装西德，这首先意味着加深爆发战争的危险，因为武装西德就是加深德国分裂和给德国复仇主义者以军队，而这些人一直是既对东方又对西方同时怀有政治和领土野心的。
    政府和议会中的政府多数派在伦敦和巴黎协定上签了字，这就是取消了法国的安全和独立的最好的保障——一九四四年十二月签订的法苏同盟互助条约。它们使得我们国家遭到美国、英国和德国帝国主义者所施加的共同压力。实现巴黎协定，就将使法国失去大国的地位，法国的大国地位现在就已经成了问题。因而，批准伦敦和巴黎协定同民族利益，同我们人民公开表示的意志显然是相抵触的。这再一次证实，在法国资产阶级领导人物中间，阶级的利己主义超过了爱国感。”
    法国共产党指出，实现巴黎协定，就会导致军备扩张和法国劳动人民生活条件的恶化。法国共产党声明：法国人民永远不会同意战争和出卖民族利益的政策，法国人民永远不会让自己卷入反对苏联的战争。
    声明还说，现在共产党人的责任是：加强工人阶级的一致行动和团结所有爱国力量和民主力量，来展开人民群众反对实现巴黎协定、反对准备原子战争、保障工人阶级和全体劳动人民的利益和保卫民主自由的斗争。
