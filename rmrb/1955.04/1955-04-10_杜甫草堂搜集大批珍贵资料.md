Du Fu Thatched Cottage Collects a Large Number of Valuable Materials

A large number of cultural relics and materials related to the great Tang Dynasty poet Du Fu are being sent from all over the country to the poet's former residence, the Du Fu Thatched Cottage in Chengdu (formerly known as the Du Fu Memorial Hall). Currently, the Thatched Cottage is under renovation. A total of 442 books and more than 3,770 volumes of Du Fu's poems and other materials have been collected; among them, there are 161 different versions of Du Fu's poems, totaling more than 1,300 volumes. There are also more than 500 photos, rubbings, and cultural relics of Du Fu's historical sites, ancestral halls, and inscriptions. Among the cultural relics are more than 20 different portraits of Du Fu since the Yuan Dynasty and various valuable materials.

Most of these cultural relics were collected with the assistance of local cultural departments. The Xi'an Municipal Bureau of Culture and the Research Institute of Culture and History also established a temporary collection team, which spent two months examining documents and conducting on-site investigations, compiling more than 100 photos and rubbings of Du Fu's historical sites, and writing a book of tens of thousands of words entitled "Historical Materials of Du Fu's Time in Chang'an."

Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, also personally wrote a couplet for the Thatched Cottage: "Wounds and scars in the world, people's sufferings; Holy philosopher in poetry, waves under the pen." The old painter Qi Baishi specially painted four paintings with Du Fu's poetic themes for the Thatched Cottage, such as "Withered Palm" and "Pairs of Loquats Fragrant."

    杜甫草堂搜集大批珍贵资料
    许多有关唐代大诗人杜甫的文物资料正从各地源源寄到诗人故居——成都杜甫草堂（前曾称杜甫纪念馆）。目前，草堂正在修理。已搜集到关于杜甫的诗集和其他资料共有四百四十二部，三千七百七十多册；其中各种不同版本的杜诗就有一百六十一部、一千三百多册。还有杜甫的遗迹、祠宇、碑铭的照片、拓片和文物五百多件。文物中有元代以来二十多种不同的杜甫画像和各种珍贵资料。
    这些文物绝大部分是在各地文化部门协助下搜集的。西安市文化局和文史研究馆还成立了临时搜集工作组，在两个月中考证文献、实地调查，集成有关杜甫遗迹的照片、拓片一百多件，还写成长几万字的“杜甫在长安时期的史料”一书。
    中国文学艺术界联合会主席团主席郭沫若也亲笔为草堂写了一幅对联：“世上疮痍、民间疾苦；诗中圣哲、笔底波涛”。老画家齐白石特为草堂画了“枯棕”“枇杷对对香”等四幅杜甫诗意画。
