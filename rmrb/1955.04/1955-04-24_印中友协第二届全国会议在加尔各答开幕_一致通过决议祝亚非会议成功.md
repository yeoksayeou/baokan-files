Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 23rd: The second National Conference of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association opened in Calcutta on the 21st.

    Among those attending the conference were Dr. Panikkar, Mrs. Uma Nehru, and Shailo Kumar Mukherjee, members of the National Conference Preparatory Committee, and more than 200 representatives from provincial (state) and local branches of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association.

    Also attending the conference were the delegation of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association headed by Chen Hansheng, Chinese Ambassador to India Yuan Zhongxian, and Chinese Consul General in Calcutta Liu Yufeng.

    After the opening of the conference, a resolution was first adopted expressing condolences to the families of the Chinese and Indian personnel who were murdered by American-Chiang Kai-shek special agents on April 11. Representatives attending the conference presented flowers to the memorial altar set up on the podium to mourn the deceased Indian and Chinese personnel. At this time, Sundarlal, the chairman of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, excitedly announced to those present: "The blood shed by the Chinese and Indians who sacrificed in this plane crash will further consolidate the friendship between our two countries."

    Shailo Kumar Mukherjee, Speaker of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly and Chairman of the National Conference Reception Committee, delivered a welcome speech at the meeting. He reviewed the history of friendship between India and China and talked about the tasks of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association. He said that Western countries are still single-mindedly trying to rule Asia and issue orders to the Asian people. But the Asia of today is no longer the Asia of the eighteenth century. India and China, with their solid friendship, have achieved their rightful place in a reawakening Asia.

    Gosh, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta, emphasized in his opening speech that India and China must exchange experiences and opinions with each other. Speaking of the Asian-African Conference, Gosh said, "No Asian country will tolerate foreign rule. We are determined to make ourselves peaceful countries."

    In his speech, Sundarlal condemned the conspiracy of the United States and Chiang Kai-shek elements to sabotage the "Kashmir Princess" aircraft. He said, "We know perfectly well who should be held responsible for this unfortunate incident." He called on peace-loving people to be vigilant. He said, "The challenge to China on the Taiwan issue is also a challenge to India and the entire Asia. We must not tolerate foreign rule over an inch of Asian land. We Indian people must not tolerate the US Seventh Fleet stationed in Taiwan."

    Chinese Ambassador to India Yuan Zhongxian spoke at the meeting. He congratulated the conference on its success. He said, "We Chinese people and Indian people warmly welcome the development of friendship and cooperation, and we will do everything in our power to expand the scope of this friendly relationship and enrich its content. I have no doubt that through the joint efforts of our two peoples, we will achieve even greater achievements in the future."

    Chen Hansheng, head of the delegation of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, emphasized in his speech the need to promote closer relations between China and India.

    The delegation presented gifts such as Chinese embroidery and Chinese translations of the works of Kalidasa and Tagore to the conference.

    The conference unanimously passed a resolution wishing the Asian-African Conference success and hoping that the conference would reach common opinions on issues such as self-determination, economic and cultural cooperation, and the promotion of world peace. This resolution has been telegraphed to Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru in Bandung.

    The meeting read congratulatory messages from Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan, West Bengal Governor H.K. Mukherjee, and Speaker of the People's House G.V. Mavalankar.

    The meeting was then divided into four groups to discuss the following issues: (1) Sino-Indian relations are a factor in peace in Asia and the world, (2) trade and economic relations between China and India, (3) cultural relations between China and India, (4) organizational issues of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association.
