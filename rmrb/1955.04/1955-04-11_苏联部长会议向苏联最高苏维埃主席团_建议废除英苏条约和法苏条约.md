    建议废除英苏条约和法苏条约
    新华社十日讯　塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：
    在苏联部长会议
    关于一九四二年五月二十六日的英苏条约
    一九四二年五月二十六日，苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和大不列颠及北爱尔兰联合王国，缔结了战时反对希特勒德国及其欧洲与国和战后合作互助同盟条约。根据这一条约，英国和苏联承担了义务，要采取它们力所能及的一切措施，务使德国的侵略不可能重演，并且决不缔结反对另一缔约国的任何同盟，或参加反对另一缔约国的任何集团。
    同所承担的义务相反，英国政府和英国议会已经签订和批准了规定西德重新军国主义化和使它参加反对苏联的军事联盟的巴黎协定。
    鉴于英国这样直接违反它根据一九四二年英苏条约承担的义务的行动，苏联部长会议按照苏联政府在它一九五四年十二月二十日和一九五五年二月二十八日致英国政府的照会中所阐明的态度，已经向苏联最高苏维埃主席团提出了关于废除上述一九四二年五月二十六日缔结的英苏条约的建议供它考虑。
    关于一九四四年十二月十日的法苏条约
    一九四四年十二月十日，苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和法兰西共和国缔结了一项同盟互助条约。根据这一条约，法国和苏联承担了义务，要共同采取一切必要的措施，以消灭任何来自德国的新威胁、防止将使德国方面可能进行新的侵略尝试的行动，并且决不缔结反对另一缔约国的任何同盟或参加反对另一缔约国的任何集团。
    同所承担的义务相反，法国政府和法国议会已经签订和批准了规定西德重新军国主义化和使它参加反对苏联的军事联盟的巴黎协定。
    鉴于法国这种直接违反它根据一九四四年的法苏条约承担的义务的行动，苏联部长会议按照苏联政府在它一九五四年十二月十六日和一九五五年三月十八日致法国政府的照会中所阐明的态度，已经向苏联最高苏维埃主席团提出了关于废除上述一九四四年十二月十日缔结的法苏条约的建议供它考虑。
