    A Conspiracy to Create Discord
    Hu Jin
    As the date of the Asian-African Conference draws nearer, there is an increasingly intense activity trying to lead the Asian-African Conference away from the original peaceful and friendly goals of its initiators and onto a path of strife. The purpose of this is to provide cover for the activities of imperialist aggressor blocs in promoting colonialism, creating tension, and preparing for new wars in Asia.
    Recently, a series of articles published by the British Information Services blatantly embraced this goal. On the one hand, these articles conceal the hostile attitude of Western colonialists towards the Asian-African Conference; on the other hand, they try their best to instigate and poison the atmosphere of the Asian-African Conference.
    In a recent article, a commentator for the British Information Services decided to disguise himself as someone who agrees with peaceful coexistence and the expansion of peaceful regions. This is not surprising, because these demands have become—as the British Information Services article admits—"the most powerful attraction for the majority of the world's people" and a goal that "the British people heartily endorse." The British Information Services commentator cannot fail to see that, in the face of such a trend, it is dangerous to openly oppose the Asian-African Conference and defend colonialism and war policies. Therefore, he cannot but first put on a mask of supporting peaceful coexistence to deliberately create discord, spread rumors, and instigate, hoping that this will make the Asian-African Conference achieve nothing.
    However, as soon as the British Information Services propagandist tried to further develop his hypocritical argument, he immediately gave himself away. He said that the desire to "expand the peaceful region" is "a driving force identical to that of the United Kingdom and other governments participating in the Southeast Asia Defense Treaty." However, it is well known that the "Southeast Asia Defense Treaty" has nothing in common with a peaceful region that expands international friendly cooperation in Asia, and precisely hinders and undermines development in this direction. Recently, Indian Prime Minister Nehru made it very clear: "It seems very odd to emphasize military alliances and treaties in Southeast Asia, West Asia, and elsewhere in the name of security and peace. The situation of the countries of Indochina after the Geneva Conference was promising and good. Then out of nowhere there appeared an attempt, supposedly through some military treaty or alliance, to ensure the security and peace of Southeast Asia, and this treaty or alliance was founded in Manila… I now feel very clearly that the Manila Treaty and the Bangkok Conference have overturned any peaceful concept, or any concept of security, that previously existed in that region. The whole concept of the Geneva Conference is coexistence.” Indonesian National Party Vice Chairman Mangunsarkoro also said that this treaty "reflects a new form of foreign colonial rule over Southeast Asian countries." The Pakistan Times has also condemned the Southeast Asia Treaty as a "new measure to split Asian countries and provoke greater disputes." And it is precisely because of this that this treaty, named "Southeast Asia," is still rejected by some major countries in Southeast Asia that truly advocate peaceful coexistence.
    The British Information Services commentator's attempt to defend his position by using this trick of switching concepts actually only reveals that the peace in the mouths of the Western aggressive bloc is only the "peace" of imperialism based on power, and its so-called "expanding the peaceful region" is expanding the region of colonial rule.
    The British Information Services' smear of the position of China, the Soviet Union, and other people's democratic countries in supporting the Asian-African Conference, and its attempt to shift the responsibility for international tension onto others is also very clumsy.
    It sets aside the immediate fact that the United States forcibly occupies Taiwan and other coastal islands of China, causing tension in the region, but fabricates that the Communists seized land "by force or threat of force." It talks about the unification issues of Korea and Indochina, shifting the responsibility for the United States, Britain, and other countries that invaded Korea obstructing the peaceful unification of Korea, and for plotting to sabotage the general election in Indochina, onto the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. However, the propagandist of the British Information Services slipped up in slandering peaceful and democratic countries. He did not even think it necessary to consult the necessary documentary basis and openly lied, saying that the Geneva Accords "suggested" that Vietnam "hold elections under the supervision of the United Nations"!
    Black characters are written on white paper. Article 7 of the final declaration of the Geneva Conference on the provisions for the general election in Vietnam states that it should be "held under the supervision of an international commission composed of representatives of member countries of the International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission stipulated in the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities." The Geneva Accords did not "suggest" any "election under the supervision of the United Nations." Isn't this crystal clear?
    As repeatedly emphasized in the Geneva Conference debates, the holding of elections by the Vietnamese people is completely unrelated to the United Nations. Britain was one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference and one of the signatories to the Geneva Agreement. It should be very familiar with the situation of the Geneva Conference debates and has an unshirkable obligation to urge the implementation of the decisions passed by the conference. The lie issued by the British Information Services that does not respect the Geneva Agreement cannot but make people suspect that it is a malicious attempt to revise the solemn agreement of the Geneva Conference and undermine the general election in Vietnam that is at play.
    It is worth pointing out that in the days before the British Information Services issued this argument that endangers the Geneva Agreement, Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson actually stated that Canada could only help implement supervision after the responsibilities and steps for holding elections in Vietnam were clearly and satisfactorily defined. Canada is a member of the International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission and bears the important responsibility of supervising the ceasefire and supervising the election. At a time when the United States is making every effort to plot to undermine the general election in Vietnam, this argument can only be used by the United States to achieve its goal of undermining the general election and undermining the ceasefire in Vietnam.
    The British Information Services commentator's attempt to influence the Asian-African Conference, causing disputes and opposition, by following Pearson's argument and issuing arguments that do not respect the Geneva Agreement is obvious.
    The British gentlemen are playing a clumsy conspiracy, wanting to make the Asian-African Conference abandon its sacred task of promoting international peace and friendship and the development of national independence, and become an ugly tool for imperialism to create international disputes in order to facilitate the intensification of tension, cover up the preparation for war, and maintain colonial interests. This conspiracy is doomed to fail. The awakened Asian and African people have enough experience to see through the imperialist pretenses and confusing tricks.

    制造纷争的诡计
    胡今
    亚非会议举行的日期越来越近，正有一种越来越紧张的活动，想把亚非会议引离其发起国原定的和平友好的目标而走上纷争的道路，以便替帝国主义侵略集团在亚洲推行殖民主义、制造紧张局势和准备新战争的活动打掩护。
    最近，英国新闻处发表的一连串文章就露骨地抱着这种目的。这些文章一方面掩饰西方殖民主义者对亚非会议的敌视态度，另一方面竭力进行挑拨，毒化亚非会议的气氛。
    在最近的一篇文章中，英国新闻处的评论家决定要把自己装扮成为赞同和平共处和扩大和平地区的样子。这是不奇怪的，因为这些要求已经成为——如英国新闻处的文章所承认的——“最强烈地吸引世界上大多数人”，也是“英国人民衷心赞同的”目标。英国新闻处的评论家不能不看到，在人民这样的潮流前面，要公开站出来反对亚非会议，为殖民主义和战争政策辩护是危险的。因此，他不能不先带上赞成和平共处的面具来故意制造纷争，造谣挑拨，希望这样可以使亚非会议无所成就。
    但是英国新闻处的宣传家刚一试图进一步发挥他的伪善论点时，立刻就露了马脚。他说“扩大和平地区”这个愿望是“一种同联合王国和参加东南亚防务集团条约的其他政府所具有的动力相同的动力”。但是，尽人皆知，“东南亚防务集团条约”和在亚洲扩大国际友好合作的和平地区没有丝毫共同之处，而且恰恰阻挠和破坏这个方向上的发展。最近，印度总理尼赫鲁就说得很清楚：“以安全和和平的名义特别强调在东南亚、西亚和其他地方的军事联盟和条约似乎是很离奇的。印度支那各国在日内瓦会议以后的情况是有希望的和良好的。然后凭空出现了据说是通过某种军事条约或联盟以确保东南亚的安全和和平的尝试，这种条约或联盟的基础是在马尼拉奠定的……我现在觉得很清楚，马尼拉条约和曼谷会议已经推翻了先前在那个地区存在的任何和平观念，或任何安全概念。日内瓦会议的整个概念是共处。”印度尼西亚国民党副主席曼贡沙哥罗也说这个条约“反映着外国殖民者统治东南亚国家的新形式”。巴基斯坦时报也曾经谴责东南亚条约是“分裂亚洲国家和挑拨更大的纠纷的新措施”。而且正是因为如此，这个名为“东南亚”的条约，至今依然被东南亚真正主张和平共处的一些主要国家所唾弃。
    英国新闻处的评论家想用这种偷梁换柱的办法来辩护自己的立场，实际上只是暴露出，西方侵略集团口中的和平只是帝国主义的建立在强权基础上的“和平”，它的所谓“扩大和平区域”就是扩大殖民统治区域。
    英国新闻处诬蔑中苏两国和其他人民民主国家支持亚非会议的立场，力图把国际紧张局势的责任加在别人头上的作法也是十分拙劣的。
    它撇开美国武力霸占台湾和中国其他沿海岛屿，引起这一地区紧张局势的眼前事实，却胡诌什么共产党“以武力或武力威胁”夺得土地。它谈到朝鲜和印度支那的统一问题，把美国和英国等侵朝国家阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，和阴谋破坏印度支那的普选的责任，推到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国的身上。但是英国新闻处的宣传员在诽谤和平民主国家中间写溜了笔，他甚至不认为有必要查阅一下必要的文件依据而公然撒谎，说日内瓦协定“建议”越南“在联合国视察下进行选举”！
    黑字写在白纸上，日内瓦会议最后宣言第七条关于越南普选的规定，写的是要“在停止敌对行动协定中所规定的国际监督和监察委员会成员国代表所组成的国际委员会的监督下举行普选”。日内瓦协定并没有“建议”什么“在联合国视察下进行选举”，这不是明明白白的事吗？
    像日内瓦会议辩论中所反复被强调指出的，越南人民举行选举是和联合国根本不相干的。英国是日内瓦会议的主席之一，又是日内瓦协议的签字国之一，它应该很熟悉日内瓦会议辩论的情况，并且对会议通过的决定负有督促其实现的不可推卸的义务。英国新闻处发出的这种不尊重日内瓦协议的谎言，不能不令人怀疑这是一种修改日内瓦会议的庄严协议、破坏越南普选的恶劣企图在起作用。
    值得指出的是，在英国新闻处发出这种危害日内瓦协议的论调的前几天，加拿大外长皮尔逊竟然表示，在越南举行选举的职责和步骤必须清楚地和令人满意地规定了之后，加拿大才能帮助执行监督。加拿大是国际监督和监察委员会的成员，负有监督停战和监督选举的重大责任。在美国正在竭力阴谋破坏越南普选的时候，这种论调只能被美国所利用来达到它的破坏普选、破坏越南停战的目的。
    英国新闻处评论员紧跟在皮尔逊之后向亚非会议发出不尊重日内瓦协定的论调显然是想要影响亚非会议，使会议发生纷争和对立。
    英国绅士们是在玩弄着一个拙劣的阴谋，想使亚非会议抛弃它应该承担起来的促进国际和平友好和民族独立发展的神圣任务而成为帝国主义制造国际纷争以便于加剧紧张局势、掩护准备战争、维护殖民利益的丑恶工具。这种阴谋是注定要失败的。觉醒了的亚非人民有足够的经验识破帝国主义装模作样、迷乱人心的鬼计。
