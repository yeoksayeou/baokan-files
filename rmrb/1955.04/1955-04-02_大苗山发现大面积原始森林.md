    Large Area of Virgin Forest Discovered in Damiaoshan
    Recently, forestry survey personnel from Guangxi Province discovered a large area of virgin forest in the remote mountains of the Damiaoshan Miao Autonomous Region, at an altitude of 1,200 meters, rarely visited by people. Its accumulation is considerable. The forest contains ancient trees hundreds of years old, verdant and towering. There are valuable trees such as *Kao*, *Ke*, and *Nan*, as well as *Lingnan Podocarpus nagi*, *Quercus variabilis*, *Ligustrum lucidum*, and *Eucommia ulmoides*. These are all high-quality industrial timber and materials for construction and furniture. (Xinhua News Agency)

    大苗山发现大面积原始森林
    最近，广西省林野调查人员，在大苗山苗族自治区拔海一千二百公尺人迹罕到的群山里，发现了大面积的原始森林。它的积蓄量相当大。森林中有数百年的古树，青葱参天。有价值极高的栲、柯楠等树木，还有岭南罗汉松、栓皮栎、百日青和杜仲。这些都是质量优良的工业用材和建筑、家具用材。（新华社）
