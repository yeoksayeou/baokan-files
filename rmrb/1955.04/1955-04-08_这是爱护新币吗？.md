    Is This Cherishing the New Currency?
  　Liu Shiping
    Recently, in some individual villages in Yunnan, some farmers going to the supply and marketing cooperatives to buy things would hold the new Renminbi in their palms all the way, afraid to fold it and put it in their pockets. In Puer, a caravan, after traveling for several days, had people holding the new Renminbi in their hands.
    Cherishing the new Renminbi is everyone's responsibility. Many people specifically bought wallets to hold the new Renminbi, and many people carefully put the new Renminbi in the back pockets of their trousers to avoid folding it, all of which is completely appropriate.
    But why is it necessary to hold the new Renminbi in one's hands? There are some strange reasons for this:
    In Yunnan, Zhang Yu, a cadre at the Baoshan Tenth District People's Bank branch, forcibly confiscated new currency that had been slightly creased or had a torn opening from farmers. In addition, many commercial departments have also refused to accept new currency with tears. As a result, some vendors also refused to accept new currency, with vendors saying to buyers, "My wallet isn't ready, give me old currency." In Mojiang Ba Liu District, a farmer sold a pig for more than one hundred and twenty yuan in new currency, bought more than thirty yuan worth of goods, and exchanged the remaining ninety yuan for old currency in installments on the way home.
    Why does this phenomenon occur? The reason is that our bank cadres and some cadres in commercial departments are not acting in accordance with the Party's policies and the interests of the masses when implementing the "Measures for the Exchange of Defective Legal Tender." They do not understand that educating the masses to cherish the new Renminbi does not mean that damaged Renminbi cannot be circulated. If you think that because I have educated you, you must not damage it, and if you damage it, I will not accept it, this is just a crude way of treating the masses. The effect of doing so is very bad.
    Liang Yujie, the deputy section chief of the Cashier Section of the Yunnan Provincial Branch of the People's Bank, was particularly original in handling damaged new currency. On March 7, a citizen came to the First Office of the Kunming Municipal Branch to exchange a one-yuan note with a torn opening. The clerk at the time could not decide and asked the provincial branch's Cashier Section for instructions. Deputy Section Chief Liang enthusiastically ran over in person, stood outside the counter, took the one-yuan note, looked at it, and without thinking, said to the person making the exchange, "This note of yours is no good anymore, you should cherish the Renminbi." He then took the cancellation stamp and personally stamped the note, publicly declaring it invalid, returning it to the exchanger, and asking for proof. Taking advantage of the section chief's presence, the comrades at the office took out two one-yuan notes with some oil stains on the surface that had been collected the day before from the vault and asked the section chief what to do. After seeing them, Deputy Section Chief Liang immediately stamped them with the cancellation stamp. The First Office then returned these two one-yuan notes with oil stains to the customers.
    Obviously, this was completely a momentary impulse, crudely canceling the new currency in the hands of the masses. This is a simplified approach that does not analyze specific situations. This is a concrete manifestation of the bureaucratic style of being divorced from the masses. This approach is in complete violation of the Party and state's policies. It is hoped that the People's Banks and commercial departments in various regions will pay attention to strengthening the policy education of cadres.

### 这是爱护新币吗？

    这是爱护新币吗？
  　刘时平
    最近在云南的个别乡村里，有的农民到供销合作社买东西，一路上，把新人民币捧在手掌上走，不敢折叠装在口袋里。在普洱有一马帮，走了几天路程，人们都把新人民币拿在手上。
    爱护新的人民币是人人有责的。有许多人特地买了钱夹子装新人民币，有许多人把新人民币仔细地装在裤子后面的袋子里，不使折叠，这些都是完全应该的。
    但是为什么非把新人民币捧在手上不行呢？这也有一些奇怪的原因：
    在云南，保山十区人民银行营业所的干部张育，曾将农民揉皱了一点和撕破了口的新币强行没收。另外，有许多商业部门也曾发生过拒收有裂口的新币的事。影响所及，有的小贩也拒收新币，小贩对买东西的人说：“我的钱包没做好，给我旧币吧。”在墨江坝柳区，有一个农民把卖猪的一百二十多元新币，买了三十多元的货物，其余的九十元，在回家的途中，分次全部换成了旧币。
    为什么会产生这种现象呢？原因是我们的银行干部和某些商业部门的干部在执行“残缺本币兑换办法”时，不是按照党的政策和群众利益办事。他们不了解教育群众爱护新人民币，并不等于残缺了的人民币就不让流通。如果以为我既教育了你，你就不得弄坏，坏了我就不收，这只是一种粗暴地对待群众的作风。这样做的效果是很坏的。
    人民银行云南省分行的出纳科副科长梁玉洁，在处理破损新币时，就是独出心裁。三月七日，昆明市支行第一办事处有群众来换撕破了口的一元券，当时营业员决定不了，请示省行出纳科，梁副科长热情地亲自跑去，站在柜台外，把一元券接过来，看了一下，不加思索，就对兑换的人说：“你这张票子不行了，你应爱护人民币。”随即拿过注销章来，亲手在票面上盖了章，当众宣告作废，退回兑换人，并要打证明。办事处的同志趁科长没走，从库内又拿出来在头一天收进的两张票面上有点油渍的一元券请示科长怎么办。梁副科长看后随即打上注销章。第一办事处又把这两张有油渍的一元券，送还顾客。
    显然的，这完全是一时心血来潮，粗暴地把群众手里的新币注销作废。这是一种不分析具体情况，简单化的做法。这是脱离群众的官僚主义作风的具体表现。这种做法，是完全违背党和国家的政策的。希望各地人民银行和商业部门都注意加强干部的政策教育。
