Relief funds allocated to disaster areas by the state are a material guarantee for organizing disaster victims to help themselves through production. If relief funds are distributed and used rationally, they can play a role in overcoming natural disasters.

However, many problems have arisen in the distribution of relief funds in various places, especially the tendency to distribute them evenly. For example, in Yinhui Town, Guichi County, Anhui Province, relief funds were divided equally at five jiao per person. In Xinqiao Township, Qingwei District, Huaining County, all "relief households" were given an equal share of eight fen for adults and five fen for children, which became a system. In Huaihua Township, Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, some township cadres put forward the slogan of "overall contracting, supply system," and the relief coverage in the whole township accounted for 98.5% of the total number of disaster-stricken households. In Xinmin Township, Yangzhong County, Jiangsu Province, regardless of whether there was labor or the ability to help oneself, each person received an average of 1 yuan and 7 fen per month. In Xiongcuo Township, Zhangpu County, Fujian Province, each time funds were distributed, the natural village was used as the unit, and the masses were divided into three classes, with an average distribution. In Yaocuo Village, the entire village of 30 households received relief funds, with the first class receiving 2 yuan and 7 jiao per person, the second class 1 yuan and 8 jiao per person, and the third class 1 yuan per person. The middle peasant Cai Fushun's family was well-off enough and received relief funds. The first allocation of 470 yuan in the whole township provided relief to 237 households, accounting for 88% of the total number of households in the township, with an average of less than 2 yuan per household. In Duying Township, Qi District, Lipu County, Guangxi Province, when distributing relief funds, 25 households received 5 yuan each. When Shicheng Township, Ba County, Hebei Province, issued housing repair subsidies, regardless of the severity of the collapse, each room was subsidized 25 yuan.

As a result of not concentrating relief funds on the most needed areas, although the money was spent, no problems were solved. This is just as the masses in Zhenliang Township, Guiping County, Guangxi Province, said, the relief funds distributed evenly "are not salty when buying salt, and not sour when buying vinegar." Moreover, the average distribution of relief funds also easily fosters the mood of the masses waiting for government relief without actively participating in production.

The tendency to distribute relief funds evenly is mainly due to the lack of in-depth work by grassroots cadres and their consideration for personal relationships. They are afraid of causing dissatisfaction among the masses who have not received or have received less relief funds. The words of the Party branch secretary of Xinliao Township, Zhenze County, Jiangsu Province, represent this kind of thinking. He said: "It is difficult to calculate who gets more and who gets less, and everyone has no opinion if they all get something." However, in fact, the method of average distribution is precisely causing dissatisfaction among the masses, because this method is of little benefit to disaster relief work. In order to distribute relief funds well, grassroots cadres must break through personal relationships, go deep into reality, understand the production and living conditions of disaster victims, and distribute relief funds according to the actual needs of each household. Only in this way can relief funds play a role in helping disaster victims produce and solve their difficulties.

As early as December 1949, the State Council pointed out in its instructions on production and disaster relief: Relief grain "should be used well. Do not distribute it evenly, but use it to help disaster victims produce, to be used in the most difficult times and regions, and first of all to help the most difficult disaster victims, especially the dependents of revolutionary martyrs and disabled soldiers who have no labor force and the widowed, orphaned, and childless elderly and those who cannot carry out production for self-relief."

In the future, all disaster areas must act in this spirit and conscientiously do a good job in the distribution of relief funds. We advocate using steel on the blade, resolutely oppose the "scattering flowers from the sky" distribution method, oppose everyone eating and everyone having a share, which results in a large consumption of relief funds, but cannot truly support disaster victims in overcoming natural disasters.

    反对平均发放救济款
    司枕亚
    国家拨给灾区的救济款，是组织灾民生产自救的物质保证。救济款要发放和使用得合理，就能起到战胜灾荒的作用。
    但是，各地在发放救济款的工作中，却出现不少毛病，尤其以平均发放的偏向为严重。例如：安徽省贵池县殷汇镇救济款按每人五角平分；怀宁县庆圩区新桥乡凡是“救济户”，统按大人八分、小孩五分平分，并成了制度。湖南省湘阴县槐花乡有的乡干部提出“全面包干、供给制”的口号，全乡救济面竟占灾民总户数的百分之九十八点五。江苏省扬中县新民乡不分劳动力有无、自救能力强弱，每人每月平均一元零七分。福建省漳浦县雄厝乡每次发款都以自然村为单位，村村都把群众分为三等，平均发放。该乡姚厝村全村三十户都领到救济款，一等的每人二元七角，二等的每人一元八角，三等的每人一元。中农蔡福顺家本来够吃，也得到救济款。全乡第一次发款四百七十元，救济了二百三十七户，占全乡总户数的百分之八十八，每户平均不到二元。广西省荔浦县七区杜英乡发放救济款时，有二十五户一律平均得到五元。河北省霸县石城乡发修房补助费时，不论倒塌程度轻重，一律每间补助二十五元。
    由于没有把救济款集中用在最需要的地方，结果虽然把钱花了，可是什么问题也解决不了。这正如广西省桂平县镇良乡群众所说的，平均发放的救济款，“买盐不咸，买醋不酸”。而且平均发放救济款，也容易助长群众单等政府救济，不积极参加生产的情绪。
    平均发放救济款的偏向所以发生，主要是基层干部工作不深入和顾虑情面。他们唯恐引起没有得到或少得了救济款的群众不满。江苏省震泽县新潦乡党支部书记的话就代表这种思想。他说：“谁多谁少很难算，大家都发没意见。”然而事实上，平均发放的办法却正引起群众的不满，因为这种办法对救灾工作很少益处。为把救济款发好，基层干部必须打破情面，深入实际，了解灾民生产生活情况，按照各户实际需要来发放救济款。也只有这样，救济款才能起到扶助灾民生产，解决灾民困难的作用。
    国务院早在一九四九年十二月关于生产救灾的指示中就指出：救济粮“应该很好地使用。不要平均分配，要用在扶助灾民生产上，要用在最困难的时候和地区，首先应帮助最困难的灾民，特别是无劳动力的烈军工属与鳏寡孤独及无法进行生产自救的人。”
    今后各灾区必须本着这种精神，切实作好救济款的发放工作。我们主张把钢使在刀刃上，坚决反对那种“天女散花”式的发放办法，反对户户皆吃、人人有份，而使救济款大量消耗，却不能真正支持灾民战胜灾荒的错误作法。
