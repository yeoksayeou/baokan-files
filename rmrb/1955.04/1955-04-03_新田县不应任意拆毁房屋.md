Title: Xintian County Should Not Arbitrarily Demolish Houses

To the Editor:

The people of Xintian County, Hunan Province, are very dissatisfied with the Xintian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for arbitrarily demolishing local public houses to build county committee office buildings.

The County Committee's offices were originally sufficient, but the style was old and unattractive. In addition, there was a relatively dilapidated house, which could be used if it were repaired. However, Meng Zhaohe, the County Party Secretary (who was transferred to the Guiyang County Committee Secretary in February of this year), believed that repairing old houses was not as good as "looking further ahead" and building an office building.

According to Meng Zhaohe's decision, in addition to the original 6,000 yuan for repairs, 3,000 yuan of the 4,000+ yuan county-level机关 repair funds from 1954 were "centrally used" to build the building. However, the cost of an office building was 15,600 yuan. What to do? Without discussing it with the County Committee, Meng Zhaohe decided to solve the problem by demolishing local public houses. In September 1954, the new office building was completed; in addition to a large temple, two houses belonging to the Grain Bureau and a very well-built bungalow of the County Committee were demolished.

Although the style of the new office building is attractive, the shortcoming is that there is not enough room. At the end of 1954, Meng Zhaohe requested instructions from the Chenxian Prefectural Office to "centrally use" another 16,000 yuan of the county's 18,000 yuan repair funds to start building a second office building and a kitchen. They hired a group of people to contract the supply of bricks and tiles, allowing the contractors to search everywhere for local public houses and ancestral halls to demolish indiscriminately. The completion of the second office building resulted in the destruction of twelve public houses, ancestral halls, and a primary school.

The County Committee's construction of two buildings has had a very negative impact on the masses.

Because the county's construction funds were "centrally used" by the County Committee, other agencies could not use them. Because the opinions of the local government and the masses were not sought when demolishing the old houses, many houses that could be used and were needed by the masses were also demolished. The Shuikoushan Nunnery in the Second District was solidly built and could be used as a grain warehouse, but the County Committee demolished it without going through the district. There was an old house on the main road of Tuqiaoping Township in the Fifth District, which was a place for pedestrians to rest and drink tea, but the County Committee demolished it regardless of the requirements of the township cadres and the masses.

From what I understand, some counties and districts are imitating the bad practice of arbitrarily demolishing local public houses to build large buildings. For example, the Leiyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party demolished seventeen public old houses in order to build the building larger and better, and paid the masses low wages to collect and transport public forest timber. This incident occurred in October 1953, and although it was exposed and constantly urged by the forestry industry department, no final decision has been made to date.

I believe that local public buildings must not be demolished casually, and the relevant leading organs should take effective measures to stop this.

Sincerely,
Xian Lu

### 新田县不应任意拆毁房屋

    新田县不应任意拆毁房屋编辑同志：
    湖南省新田县人民对于中共新田县委会滥拆地方公有房屋修建县委办公大楼的事情很不满意。
    县委会的办公室本来是够用的，只是样式古老，不好看。另外有一幢房子比较破旧，如果修补一下，也就可用了，可是，县委书记孟昭鹤（今年二月调任中共桂阳县委书记）认为修修补补，还是住的旧房子，不如“眼光看远一点”，建筑一座办公大楼。
    根据孟昭鹤的决定，除了原有的六千元修缮费外，又把一九五四年全县县级机关修缮费四千多元“集中使用”了三千元来造楼房。可是一幢办公楼的造价要一万五千六百元，怎么办呢？孟昭鹤不经县委会讨论，就决定用拆毁地方公有房屋的办法来解决。一九五四年九月，新的办公楼修成了；而被拆掉的除了一座大庙以外，还有粮食局的两幢房屋和县委会一幢质量很好的平房。
    新办公楼虽然式样好看，美中不足的是房间反而不够用了。一九五四年年底，孟昭鹤又请示了郴县专署，把县里的修缮费一万八千元再“集中使用”一万六千元，动工盖第二幢办公楼和一个厨房。他们找了一批人来承包供应砖瓦的工作，让承包人到处寻找地方公有房屋和祠堂乱拆一气。第二幢办公楼的落成，共有十二座公有房屋、祠堂和一所小学遭了殃。
    县委会修起了二幢楼房，给予群众的影响是很恶劣的。
    由于全县的修建费被县委会“集中使用”，其它机关就用不到了；由于拆旧房子时没有征求当地政府和群众的意见，很多可以使用和群众需要的房屋也被拆掉了。二区水口山庵建筑结实，可以作粮食仓库，县委会不通过区里就拆了。五区土桥坪乡来往要道上有座旧房子，是行人休息和饮茶的地方，县委会也不顾乡干部和群众的要求而拆掉了。
    据我了解，为了盖大楼而滥拆地方公有房子的恶劣做法，有些县区正在仿效。例如：中共耒阳县委因为想把楼房盖得大些好些，就拆去了公家的旧屋十七幢，并且以低额的工资让群众采运公有林木。这件事情发生在一九五三年十月，虽然经过森林工业部门的揭发和不断督促，到现在还没作出最后的处理。
    我认为地方公有的建筑决不容许随便拆毁，有关领导机关应该采取有效措施来加以制止。
