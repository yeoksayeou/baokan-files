The Blood of Journalists
Méi Yì, Vice President of the All-China Journalists Association

All honest journalists in the world will never forget the events of April 11, 1955.

At the very forefront of the peace ranks, eleven loyal peace warriors: Xinhua News Agency reporters Shen Jiantu and Huang Zuomei, Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter and Deputy Secretary-General of the All-China Journalists Association Du Hong, Xinhua News Agency reporter and Guangming Daily reporter Li Ping, Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio photographer Hao Fengge, Polish "People's Tribune" reporter Staritz, "Austrian People's Voice" reporter Yan Feide, and staff members of the People's Republic of China delegation to the Asian-African Conference Shi Zhiang, Li Zhaoji, and Zhong Buyun, and staff member of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam delegation to the Asian-African Conference Wang Mingfang, were assassinated by agents of the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs.

Among the martyred heroes, five were outstanding journalists from our country, and two were reporters from Poland and Austria. We suddenly lost seven close comrades-in-arms and comrades in the ranks of journalists. The price is too heavy! The price paid by our country's journalists for the international cause of peace is especially heavy!

When we first heard the unfortunate news, we almost couldn't believe that they had really sacrificed. However, the ruthless bad news finally confirmed: The martyrs finally contributed their precious lives for human justice and international peace. The vicious conspiracy of the American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's murderers succeeded. This is a blood feud! This murder once again proves that American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang are the mortal enemies of all peace-loving people in Asia and the world. They are afraid that the Asian-African Conference will greatly promote friendly cooperation between Asian and African countries, especially friendly cooperation between the People's Republic of China and Asian and African countries. They use every means to sabotage the Asian-African Conference. The sabotage incident on April 11 was part of their conspiracy plan. Now, Air India International has issued a statement regarding the crash of the "Kashmir Princess" Constellation aircraft carrying members of the Chinese delegation and journalists attending the Asian-African Conference. According to the reports of the three surviving crew members on the plane, it fully proves that the explosion and fire that caused the plane crash were caused by external causes completely unrelated to the structure of the plane itself. Obviously, this "external cause" could only be that the US-Chiang Kai-shek agents placed some explosives on the plane before it took off from Hong Kong. This proves that the warning issued by our government to the British side in advance and the subsequent judgment were completely correct. At this time when the Asian-African Conference is being held, the journalists of our country are willing to draw the attention of international public opinion, especially the public opinion of Asian and African countries. We must continue to expose and smash all conspiracies of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to sabotage the Asian-African Conference, and unanimously demand that the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong, based on the reports of the three surviving crew members of the "Kashmir Princess" aircraft, thoroughly investigate the April 11 incident, arrest the agents, and bring them to justice so that they cannot escape the law. The blood of the martyred heroes cannot be shed in vain!

For many years, the journalists of our country have shed blood and sacrificed on the front lines, in the enemy's prisons, and in some sudden incidents to resist imperialist aggression and enslavement, to seek the liberation of the people of the motherland, for the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and for the cause of human progress and light. They have always lived in our hearts. We have come this far following their bloody footprints.

The glorious names of the martyrs who died in the April 11 incident will be forever written in the history of the Asian and African people and the advanced human beings of the world for the cause of peace, and especially will be forever written in the history of the people's news undertakings. History will always remember that they sacrificed for the cause of friendly cooperation, independence and freedom of the people of Asia and Africa. We must avenge them! We Chinese people must resolutely liberate Taiwan and eliminate the American aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group in Taiwan. They are the masterminds of the April 11 incident and also the enemies of the cause of peace in the Asian and African region. We must strive for the success of the Asian-African Conference and for the complete victory of the world's peace cause.

    新闻工作者的血
    中国新闻工作者联谊会副会长　梅益
    世界上一切正直的新闻工作者永远不能忘记一九五五年四月十一日发生的事件。
    在和平行列的最前面，十一位忠诚的和平战士：新华社记者沈建图、黄作梅，中央人民广播电台记者、中国新闻工作者联谊会副秘书长杜宏，新华社记者兼光明日报记者李平，中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄影师郝凤格，波兰“人民论坛报”记者斯塔列茨，“奥地利人民之声报”记者严斐德和中华人民共和国出席亚非会议代表团工作人员石志昂、李肇基、钟步云，越南民主共和国出席亚非会议代表团工作人员王明芳，被美国和蒋介石匪帮的特务分子暗杀了。
    遇害的烈士中有五位是我国优秀的新闻工作者，有两位是波兰和奥地利的记者。我们在新闻工作者的队伍里突然地丧失了七名亲密的战友和同志，这代价太沉重了！我国的新闻工作者为国际和平事业所付出的代价尤其是沉重的！
    刚听到这个不幸消息的时候，我们几乎完全不能相信他们真的已经牺牲了。但是，无情的噩耗终于证实：烈士们为了人类正义和国际和平终于贡献了他们宝贵的生命。美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的特务杀人犯的狠毒阴谋竟然得逞。这是血海的深仇！这个谋杀事件又一次证明：美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮是全亚洲和全世界爱好和平人民的死敌。它们害怕亚非会议将大大地促进亚非各国之间的友好合作，特别是中华人民共和国和亚非各国之间的友好合作。它们用一切方法要破坏亚非会议。制造四月十一日的破坏事件就是它们的阴谋计划的一部分。现在，印度国际航空公司发表了关于出席亚非会议的中国代表团人员和记者乘坐的“克什米尔公主号”星座式飞机坠毁事件的声明。它根据这架飞机上的三位生还的乘务人员的报告，完全证明了使飞机失事的爆炸和起火是由于同飞机本身的构造完全无关的外来的原因造成的。显然，这个“外来原因”只能是美蒋特务在飞机从香港起飞以前安置了什么爆炸物在飞机上。这证明了我国政府事先向英国方面提出的警告和事后的判断是完全正确的。当此亚非会议正在召开的时候，我国人民的新闻工作者愿意提起国际舆论特别是亚非各国舆论的注意，我们大家必须继续揭露和粉碎美国和蒋介石匪徒破坏亚非会议的一切阴谋，并一致要求英国政府和香港英国当局，根据“克什米尔公主号”飞机的三个生还的乘务人员的报告，彻底查究四月十一日的事件，逮捕特务分子，予以法办，不能让他们漏网。殉难烈士的血是不能白流的！
    多少年来，我国人民的新闻工作者为反抗帝国主义的侵略和奴役，为求得祖国人民的解放，为抗美援朝的斗争，为人类光明进步的事业，已经有许多人在前线上，在敌人的监牢里，在一些突发的事变中流血牺牲了。他们一直活在我们的心里。我们踏着他们的血迹走过来了。
    四月十一日事件中殉难的烈士们的光荣姓名将永远写在亚非各国人民和全世界先进人类为和平事业而奋斗的历史上，特别将永远写在人民的新闻事业的历史上。历史将永远记住：他们是为了亚非两大洲人民的友好合作和独立自由的事业而牺牲的。我们必须为他们复仇！我们中国人民一定要坚决解放台湾，消灭台湾的美国侵略者和蒋介石卖国集团，他们是四月十一日事件的主谋者，也是亚非地区和平事业的敌人。我们一定要争取亚非会议的成功，争取世界和平事业的完全胜利。
