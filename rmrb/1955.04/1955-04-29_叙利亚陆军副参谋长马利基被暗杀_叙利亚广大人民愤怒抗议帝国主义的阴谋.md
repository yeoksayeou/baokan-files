Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Damascus: Syrian Army Deputy Chief of Staff, Colonel Adnan Maliki, was stabbed to death on April 22nd while watching a football match at the Damascus stadium. The murderer was a military police officer named Abdul Rahim, who has already committed suicide. He was a member of the extremely reactionary Syrian Social Nationalist Party.

　　After the overthrow of the Shishakli regime, Colonel Maliki played a significant political role in the country. He was a leader of patriotic officers in the Syrian army who firmly opposed Syria joining foreign military treaties. Maliki resolutely opposed the Turkish-Iraqi military treaty and opposed forming a military alliance with Turkey in any form. He enjoyed great prestige both in the army and among the people.

　　This assassination, carried out by the agents of the imperialists, has aroused the anger of the broad masses of the Syrian people. According to Syrian newspapers, the Syrian government and parliament have received thousands of letters and telegrams from all over the country demanding severe punishment for all those who participated in the assassination of Maliki.

　　The Syrian Communist Party issued a statement to the Syrian people regarding the assassination of Maliki. The statement said: The criminal agents of the imperialists have murdered the Syrian national hero, Colonel Maliki, who had valiantly fought against the restoration of a dictatorial regime in Syria. He was killed because he resolutely exposed the conspiracy of the imperialist war treaties and because he opposed Syria joining the Turkish-Iraqi alliance. The purpose of this crime is to undermine the unity of the Syrian army, lower its morale, and cause chaos in the country. However, neither terror nor assassination will help the imperialists to make Syria join their military treaties. The Syrian army will unite more closely with the entire Syrian people and will resolutely oppose the imperialist treaties, especially the Turkish-Iraqi alliance.

　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Beirut on the 28th, citing a TASS dispatch from Beirut on the 27th: Damascus reports that Syrian Prime Minister Asali said at a session of the Syrian Parliament on the 26th that the assassination of Syrian Army Deputy Chief of Staff Colonel Adnan Maliki was carried out by certain individuals on the instructions of a certain foreign country, with the aim of abolishing Syria's existing parliamentary system.

　　Asali also said that a total of seventy-five civilians and thirty-five soldiers had been arrested in connection with the Maliki murder. Asali promised the parliament that a government bulletin would be issued in the next few days explaining who planned the murder.

　　Most of the parliamentarians who spoke demanded that the government severely punish the conspirators and deprive Kiswanli (a parliamentarian from the National Socialist Party who participated in the conspiracy) of his parliamentary privileges.

　　Syrian Army Chief of Staff Shawkat told reporters regarding the Maliki murder: "The evidence we have shows that this assassination is a link in a series of conspiracies against the security, sovereignty, and independence of Syria and the entire Arab world."

　　According to a correspondent for the Lebanese "Al-Telegraph" in Damascus: Damascus sources have learned that the foreign country supporting the National Socialist Party and its conspiracies is the United States. "Al-Telegraph" also said that the conspirators who assassinated Maliki had planned to assassinate more Syrian army commanders, including Chief of Staff Shawkat.

    叙利亚陆军副参谋长马利基被暗杀
    叙利亚广大人民愤怒抗议帝国主义的阴谋
    据新华社讯　据大马士革消息，叙利亚陆军副参谋长阿德南·马利基上校二十二日在大马士革体育场观看足球比赛时被刺身死。凶手是宪兵军官阿卜杜勒·拉希姆，他已自杀。他是极端反动的叙利亚国家社会党党员。
  　在施舍克里政权被推翻以后，马利基上校在国内起着显著的政治作用，他是叙利亚军队中坚决反对叙利亚加入外国军事条约的具有爱国感的军官们的领袖。马利基坚决反对土耳其—伊拉克军事条约，反对同土耳其以任何形式结成军事同盟。他无论在军队中和在人民当中都享有很大的威望。
    帝国主义者指使他们的代理人进行的这一谋杀事件激起了叙利亚广大人民的愤怒。据叙利亚报纸报道，叙利亚政府和议会收到了全国各地发来的几千封信和电报，要求严厉惩治所有参加暗害马利基的人。
    叙利亚共产党就马利基被刺事件发表告叙利亚人民书。告人民书说：帝国主义者的犯罪代理人已经谋杀了叙利亚的民族英雄马利基上校，马利基曾经为了反对在叙利亚恢复独裁政体而英勇地斗争过。他被杀害是因为他坚决地揭露了帝国主义者的战争条约的阴谋，因为他反对叙利亚参加土耳其—伊拉克联盟。这个罪行的目的就是要想破坏叙利亚陆军队伍的团结，降低它的士气并在这个国家内引起混乱。但是，恐怖手段或是暗杀行为都决不能有助于帝国主义者使叙利亚参加他们的军事条约。叙利亚陆军将和全体叙利亚人民更紧密地团结起来，并将坚决地反对帝国主义者的条约，特别是反对土耳其—伊拉克联盟。
    新华社二十八日讯　据塔斯社贝鲁特二十七日讯：大马士革消息，叙利亚总理阿萨利二十六日在叙利亚议会会议上说，叙利亚陆军副参谋长阿德南·马利基上校被刺杀事件，是某些人根据某一个外国的指示而作的，其目的在于取消叙利亚现有的议会制度。
    阿萨利还说，由于马利基被害事件被捕的共有七十五个平民和三十五个军人。阿萨利答应议会在最近几天内发表政府公报，说明是谁策划这个谋杀事件的问题。
    大多数议员在发言中都要求政府严厉惩办阴谋者，并剥夺基斯万利（参加这个阴谋的国家社会党的议员）的议会特权。
    叙利亚陆军参谋长绍克尔就马利基被害事件对新闻记者说：“我们所掌握的证据表明，这个谋杀事件是反对叙利亚和整个阿拉伯世界的安全、主权和独立的一系列阴谋的一个环节。”
    据黎巴嫩“电讯报”驻大马士革记者报道：大马士革人士获悉，支持国家社会党和它的阴谋活动的外国就是美国。“电讯报”还说，暗杀马利基的阴谋者曾计划暗杀更多的叙利亚陆军的指挥官、包括参谋长绍克尔在内。
