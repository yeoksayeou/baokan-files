Xinhua News Agency, April 12th: A Constellation aircraft chartered by the Chinese delegation attending the Asian-African Conference, carrying staff members of the Chinese delegation, staff members of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam delegation, and Chinese and foreign journalists accompanying them (eleven people in total), took off from Hong Kong at 12:15 PM Beijing time on April 11th, heading to Jakarta via a transfer in Bandung. The aircraft exploded and caught fire over the sea near Sarawak, North Borneo, and the fuselage crashed into the sea. The whereabouts of all the aforementioned personnel are currently unknown. The list of Chinese personnel and foreign journalists on the plane is as follows: Delegation staff: Shi Zhi'ang, Li Zhaoji, Zhong Buyun; Journalists: Shen Jiantu, Huang Zuomei, Du Hong, Li Ping, Hao Fengge; Staff member of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam delegation: Wang Mingfang; Polish journalist: Staretz, Austrian journalist: Frieden. Also on board were the experienced Indian pilot Captain D.K. Jatar and seven other maintenance and communications personnel.

Before the delegation personnel and journalists departed, the Chinese government had already learned that the special agent organs of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang were actively planning to sabotage the Indian aircraft chartered by the Chinese delegation, to realize their long-prepared conspiracy to assassinate the members of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference, headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, and to sabotage the Asian-African Conference. At 9:30 AM on April 10th, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs specifically notified the British Office of the Chargé d'Affaires in Beijing of this situation, requesting the British Office of the Chargé d'Affaires to inform the British authorities in Hong Kong to pay attention and take measures for the safety of the aforementioned delegation personnel and journalists. An official from the British Office of the Chargé d'Affaires inquired about the airline to which the aircraft they intended to take belonged, and promised to notify the British authorities in Hong Kong. The plane crash on the 11th fully confirms the warning issued by the Chinese government.

    我出席亚非会议代表团人员座机失事经过
    新华社十二日讯　参加亚非会议的我国代表团工作人员、越南民主共和国代表团工作人员和随同前往采访新闻的中外记者共十一人，乘坐由代表团包用的印度国际航空公司的星座式客机一架，于北京时间四月十一日十二时一刻自香港起飞前往雅加达转赴万隆。该客机在飞越北婆罗洲沙捞越附近的海面上空时爆炸起火，机身坠入海中。上述全部人员至今下落不明。在飞机上的我国人员和外国新闻记者名单如下：代表团工作人员：石志昂、李肇基、钟步云；记者：沈建图、黄作梅、杜宏、李平、郝凤格；越南民主共和国代表团工作人员王明芳；波兰记者斯塔列茨、奥地利记者严斐德。此外尚有印度高级驾驶员德·克·贾塔尔上尉和其他七名机务和报务人员。
    在代表团人员和新闻记者启程前，我国政府即已获悉美国和蒋介石匪帮的特务机关正积极布置对我国代表团所包用的印度飞机进行破坏，以实现其准备已久的杀害我国以周恩来总理为首的参加亚非会议的代表团人员和破坏亚非会议的阴谋。在四月十日九时半，我外交部特将这一情况通知了驻北京的英国代办处，要求英国代办处转告香港英国当局注意，并对上述代表团人员和新闻记者的安全采取措施。英国代办处的官员问明了这些人准备乘坐的客机的所属航空公司后，答应通知香港英国当局。十一日飞机的遇难事件，完全证实了我国政府的警告。
