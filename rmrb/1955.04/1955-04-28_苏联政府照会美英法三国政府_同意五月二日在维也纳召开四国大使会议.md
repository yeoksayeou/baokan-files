Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 26th: As previously reported, the Soviet government sent notes to the governments of the United States, France, and Britain on April 19th, suggesting that the foreign ministers of the United States, France, Britain, and the Soviet Union hold a meeting in the near future, with the participation of Austrian representatives, to discuss the conclusion and signing of a peace treaty on the reconstruction of an independent and democratic Austria.

    On April 22nd, the Soviet government received a reply note from the United States government. The Soviet government also received notes of identical content from the British and French governments.

    On April 26th, the Soviet government delivered the following note to the United States Embassy in Moscow:

    The Soviet government has received the United States government's note of April 22nd, which is a reply to the Soviet government's note of April 19th of this year.

    The Soviet government notes with satisfaction that the United States government agrees to participate in a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, with the participation of Austrian representatives, to be held in the near future for the conclusion of the Austrian peace treaty. The Soviet government hopes that this meeting will take into account the results of the Moscow talks between Austria and the Soviet Union to finally resolve the Austrian issue in favor of consolidating peace in Europe and to fully restore the independence of democratic Austria.

    The Soviet government does not believe that convening a meeting of ambassadors in Vienna under the present conditions is a shortcut to reaching the necessary agreement on the Austrian issue, as this issue could well be discussed and resolved in the near future by a meeting of the four foreign ministers with Austrian participation. However, since the United States government deems it necessary to hold such a preparatory ambassadorial meeting to "carry out certain preparatory work," the Soviet government is prepared to satisfy this wish of the United States government. At the same time, the Soviet government's starting point is that, since there is currently a draft Austrian peace treaty agreed upon by all parties regarding the restoration of an independent and democratic Austria, and the parties concerned have reached a consensus through an exchange of views on the issue of Austria's development as an independent and peace-loving nation, the task of the ambassadorial meeting should only be to ensure that a meeting of the four foreign ministers with Austrian participation will be convened in the near future to discuss and sign the Austrian peace treaty.

    Based on the above, the Soviet government expresses its agreement to the aforementioned four-country ambassadorial meeting to be held in Vienna on May 2nd.

    Notes of identical content have also been sent to the British and French governments.

    Copies of the above-mentioned notes from the Soviet government to the three Western governments were also delivered on the same day to the Austrian government by Mr. N. Bischoff, Ambassador of the Republic of Austria to Moscow.

    The full text of the United States government's reply note received by the Soviet government on April 22nd is as follows:

    "The United States Government, in consultation with the Governments of the United Kingdom and France, has studied the Soviet Government's note of April 19 suggesting that the foreign ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union hold a meeting in the near future, with the participation of Austrian representatives, to discuss the conclusion and signing of a treaty on the reconstruction of an independent and democratic Austria.

    The United States Government expresses its agreement with the Soviet Government's view that it is currently possible to conclude an Austrian peace treaty. It will gladly participate in a treaty signing conference of the four foreign ministers with the participation of Austrian representatives at the earliest possible time.

    It appears from information received by the United States Government concerning the meetings of the Austrian and Soviet ministers in Moscow that some preparatory work is still necessary. Taking into consideration the tripartite declaration of April 5, the United States Government suggests that the four ambassadors in Vienna meet in the near future with the participation of Austrian representatives to study the results of the Moscow talks and to reach the necessary agreement to enable the four foreign ministers to sign the Austrian peace treaty as soon as possible. In view of this, the United States Government suggests that the four ambassadors and Austrian representatives meet in Vienna on May 2.

    Once the necessary preparatory work is completed, the nearest practically possible date should be designated for the foreign ministers to meet and sign the treaty."

    苏联政府照会美英法三国政府
    同意五月二日在维也纳召开四国大使会议
    新华社二十七日讯　塔斯社莫斯科二十六日讯：前已报道，苏联政府曾经在四月十九日照会美、法、英三国政府，建议美、法、英、苏四国外长在最近期间在奥地利代表的参加下举行会议，以讨论缔结关于重建独立民主的奥地利的和约以及在这一和约上签字的问题。
    四月二十二日苏联政府收到美国政府的复照。苏联政府还从英国政府和法国政府收到内容相同的照会。
    四月二十六日，苏联政府把下列照会交给美国驻莫斯科大使馆：
    苏联政府已收到美国政府四月二十二日的照会，即答复苏联政府今年四月十九日照会的复照。
    苏联政府满意地注意到，美国政府同意参加有奥地利代表参加的、为缔结对奥和约而在最近期内举行的苏联、美国、英国和法国四国外长会议。苏联政府希望这次会议能考虑到奥苏双方莫斯科会谈的结果而最后解决奥地利问题以利于欧洲和平的巩固，并且能够完全恢复民主奥地利的独立。
    苏联政府并不认为，在目前条件下召开驻维也纳大使会议是就奥地利问题达成必要协定的捷径，因为这个问题完全有可能在最近时期由四国外长会议在奥地利参加下讨论和解决。但是，既然美国政府认为有必要举行这种预备性的大使会议以“进行某些筹备工作”，苏联政府准备满足美国政府的这种愿望。同时，苏联政府的出发点是：既然目前具备有各方所同意的关于恢复独立和民主的奥地利的对奥和约草案，而且有关方面经过交换意见已经就奥地利作为独立和爱好和平的国家而发展的问题取得了一致的看法，大使会议的任务就只应当是：保证在最近时期召开四国外长会议在奥地利参加下讨论和签订对奥和约。
    根据上述情况，苏联政府表示同意上述四国大使会议于五月二日在维也纳举行。
    同时已送给英国政府和法国政府内容相同的照会。
    上述苏联政府致西方三国政府的照会副本也在同日由奥地利共和国驻莫斯科大使纳·比萧夫先生交给奥地利政府。
    四月二十二日苏联政府收到的美国政府的复照全文如下：
    “美国政府会同英国政府和法国政府研究了苏联政府四月十九日发出的建议美国、联合王国、法国和苏联四国外长在最近期间在奥地利代表的参加下举行会议，以讨论缔结关于重建独立民主的奥地利的和约以及在这一和约上签字的问题的照会。
    美国政府对苏联政府关于目前有可能缔结对奥和约的意见表示赞同。它将在最近可能的时间内欣然参加四国外长在奥地利代表的参加下举行的签订条约会议。
    从美国政府得到的关于奥苏两国部长在莫斯科会谈的消息中可以看出，还必需进行某些准备工作。由于考虑到四月五日的三国宣言，美国政府建议，四国驻维也纳大使在最近期间在奥地利代表的参加下进行会晤，以便研究莫斯科会谈的结果，以及达成使四国外长能够尽速签订对奥和约的必需协议。有鉴于此，美国政府建议，四国大使和奥地利代表五月二日在维也纳会晤。
    必需的准备工作一旦完成，就应当指定最近的实际上可能的日期，以便四国外长举行会议和签订条约。”
