    In the Soviet Union and People's Democracies
    Soviet Union Uses Radioactive Isotopes to Determine the Age of Rock Strata
    The Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has created a method for determining the age of rock strata using radioactive isotopes. This method is based on the laws governing the action of radioactive isotopes of various chemical elements on the Earth's crust and the time required for the elements to decompose.
    Observing the radioactive isotopes of potassium contained in granite helps determine the age of the granite. Potassium decomposes very slowly, taking billions or tens of billions of years, and produces argon when it decomposes. Scientists can determine the geological age of this rock layer based on the amount of potassium and argon contained in the granite.
    Using radioactive potassium to determine the age of rock strata has practical significance for prospecting for underground mineral deposits. This method is especially important when studying mineral deposits in igneous rocks, because there are no plant and animal remains in igneous rocks on which to base judgments about the geological age of the mineral deposits.
    Soviet scientists have also adopted the "carbon" dating method for rock layers. This method is based on the decomposition of natural radioactive isotopes of carbon. The time required for the decomposition of this element is shorter than that of radioactive elements such as potassium, uranium, and thorium, only a few thousand years. After about 5,500 years, the radioactivity of the carbon isotope disappears by half. When studying recent geological formations and plant and animal remains, the age can be calculated based on the degree of radioactivity of the carbon contained.
      The Soviet Union Publishes the First Volume of the Russian Translation of the Chinese Novel "Water Margin"
    The first volume of the Russian translation of the famous Chinese novel "Water Margin" has been published in the Soviet Union for the first time. The Russian translation of "Water Margin" is based on the 71-chapter Chinese version published in China in 1952. The book is accompanied by many illustrations by Chinese painters.
      The second volume of the Russian translation of "Water Margin" is being printed.
      The Great Achievements of the German Democratic Republic's First Five-Year Plan
    The first Five-Year National Economic Plan of the German Democratic Republic has achieved great success.
    Since the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, the Republic has established large-scale industrial constructions such as the J.V. Stalin Iron and Steel Plant near Frankfurt an der Oder, the Magas Rakosi Coking Chemical Plant in Lauchhammer, and the West Iron and Steel Plant in Calbe, as well as many metal mines, shipyards, heavy machinery factories, and several large power stations.
    While developing industry, houses have also been built on a large scale. A new city, Stalinstadt, was established near the J.V. Stalin Iron and Steel Plant. Extensive reconstruction work has been completed and many new houses have been built in Berlin, Dresden, Leipzig, Magdeburg, Karl-Marx-Stadt, Rostock, Dessau and other cities. By the end of this year, the working people of the German Democratic Republic will have received 9.1 million square meters of new housing.
    During the first Five-Year Plan, the German Democratic Republic paid great attention to the construction of schools, sports fields, cultural centers, comprehensive hospitals, holiday rest homes, sanatoriums, and children's welfare institutions. At present, large-scale housing, economic, and cultural construction is being carried out not only in cities but also in rural areas, which is unprecedented in the history of the German people. Today, the Republic has 215 cultural centers in machine tractor stations and more than 400 clubs in collective farms.
      Czechoslovakia Uses Atomic Energy in Industry and Medicine
    With the assistance of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia has begun to successfully use atomic energy in industry and medicine.
    In industry, the Škoda Machine Manufacturing Plant in Czechoslovakia has used artificial radioactive isotopes in the construction projects of nine thermal power plants. The experience of this factory in using artificial radioactive isotopes supplied by the Soviet Union proves that machines using radioactive isotopes can solve problems that X-ray machines could not easily solve in the past when inspecting thermal power plant projects. When inspecting thermal power plant projects, it can inspect places that X-ray machines could not inspect in the past, such as high-pressure pipelines and the welding points of generators. The former is also three or four times more efficient than the latter in checking welding efficiency. It takes seven hours to make a photo using an X-ray machine, while the latter only takes 30 minutes.
    The Škoda Stalingrad Machine Manufacturing Plant in Prague has begun to use artificial radioactive isotopes to inspect the quality of castings and rolled metals, and to determine the distribution of phosphorus and other components in steel.
    In medicine, Czechoslovak hospitals have begun to use radioactive cobalt to treat malignant tumors, radioactive phosphorus to treat certain blood diseases, and radioactive iodine to treat certain thyroid tumors. Recently, a pocket-sized machine using radioactive thulium has also been manufactured, which can replace bulky X-ray machines that require high-voltage power supplies.
      Significant Achievements of Albanian Handicraft Production Cooperatives
    Albanian newspapers published on the 5th a letter from the Presidium of the Albanian Handicraft Production Cooperatives Federation to the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and the Council of Ministers. The letter stated that Albanian handicraft production cooperatives had completed the tasks stipulated in the Five-Year Plan (1951-1955) by the end of February, and that by the end of this year, they would over-fulfill the plan by producing goods worth more than 1.89 billion leks (Albanian currency). At present, the cooperatives produce more than 200 kinds of goods, such as aluminum household utensils, glass, knitwear, and pottery, many of which were previously imported from abroad.

    在苏联和人民民主国家
    苏联利用放射性同位素测定岩层年龄
    苏联科学院地质化学和分析化学研究所创造了一种用放射性同位素测定岩层年龄的方法。这种方法依据各种化学元素的放射性同位素在地壳上发生作用的规律和元素分解所需的时间。
    观察花岗岩中所含的钾的放射性同位素，有助于测定花岗岩的年龄。钾分解得很慢，需要几十亿或者几百亿年，钾分解时产生氩。科学家根据含在花岗岩中的钾和氩的多少，可以确定这一岩层的地质年龄。
    利用放射性钾测定岩层年龄，对于勘测地下矿藏具有实际意义。特别是在研究火成岩中的矿藏时，这一方法就更为重要。因为在火成岩中没有通常赖以判断矿藏地质年代的动植物的残迹。
    苏联科学家还采用了岩层年代“碳”测法。这种方法是以碳的自然放射性同位素的分解现象为依据的。这一元素分解的时间比钾、铀、钍等放射性元素所需的时间短，一共只有几千年。大约过五千五百年，碳的同位素的放射性就消失了一半。在研究年代不久的地质形成和动植物的残迹时，可以根据所含的碳的放射性的程度来计算出它们的年限。
      苏联出版我国小说“水浒”俄文译本第一卷
    我国著名的小说“水浒”俄文译本第一卷在苏联首次出版了。“水浒”俄文译本是根据我国一九五二年出版的中文七十一回本翻译的。书中附有许多中国画家的插图。
      “水浒”俄文译本第二卷正在印刷中。
      民主德国第一个五年计划的巨大成就
    德意志民主共和国第一个五年国民经济计划取得了巨大的成就。
    自从五年计划实行以来，共和国建立了像奥得河畔法兰克福附近的约·维·斯大林钢铁工厂、劳赫哈麦尔的马加斯·拉科西焦炭化学工厂、卡尔比的西方钢铁工厂等大规模的工业建设、许多金属矿、造船厂、重型机器厂和若干大型发电站。
    在发展工业的同时，还大规模地建筑了房屋。在约·维·斯大林钢铁工厂的附近建立了一个新的城市斯大林斯塔特。在柏林、德累斯顿、来比锡、马格德堡、卡尔·马克思斯塔特、罗斯托克、德骚和其他城市中完成了广泛的重建工作并建筑了许多新的房屋。在今年年底以前，德意志民主共和国的劳动人民将得到九百一十万平方公尺的新住宅。
    在第一个五年计划中，德意志民主共和国对建筑学校、运动场、文化馆、综合医院、假日休息所、疗养院和儿童福利机构予以很大注意。目前不但在城市中而且在农村地区进行大规模的房屋、经济和文化建设，这在德意志人民的历史上是空前的。共和国今天在机器拖拉机站中设有二百一十五个文化馆，在公有农庄中有四百多个俱乐部。
      捷克斯洛伐克在工业和医疗方面使用原子能
    捷克斯洛伐克在苏联的援助下，已经开始在工业和医疗方面成功地使用原子能。
    在工业方面，捷克斯洛伐克的斯克德机器制造工厂已经在九个火力发电厂的建设工程上使用了人造放射性同位素。这个工厂使用苏联供给的人造放射性同位素的经验证明，使用放射性同位素的机器，可以解决过去爱克斯光机在检查火力发电厂工程时不易解决的问题。它在检查火力发电厂工程时，可以检查爱克斯光机过去不能检查到的地方，如高压管道和发电子的焊接处等。在检查焊接的效率上，后者也比前者高三、四倍。利用爱克斯光机制作照片时需时七小时，而后者只要三十分钟。
    布拉格的斯克德斯大林格勒机器制造工厂，已经开始利用人造放射性同位素来检查铸件的质量和压延金属，检定钢中的磷和其他成分的分布状况等。
    在医疗方面，捷克斯洛伐克的医院已经开始用放射性钴治疗恶性肿瘤，利用放射性磷治疗某些血液症，利用放射性碘治疗某些甲状腺瘤。最近还制造出一种使用放射性铥的袖珍型机器，它可以代替笨重的、需要高压电源的爱克斯光机。
      阿尔巴尼亚手工业生产合作社的重大成就
    阿尔巴尼亚报纸在五日登载了阿尔巴尼亚手工业生产合作社联合会主席团致阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会和部长会议的一封信。信中说，阿尔巴尼亚手工业生产合作社在二月底就已完成了五年计划
  （一九五一—一九五五年）规定的任务，在今年年底以前，它们将超计划多生产价值十八亿九千多万里克（阿币名）的物品。现在，合作社生产铝制家庭用具、玻璃、针织品和陶器等二百多种物品，其中有许多物品过去都是由国外输入的。
