Xinhua News Agency, April 19th: Journalists from many countries continue to express condolences and indignation over the martyrdom of Chinese and foreign journalists who were traveling to Bandung to cover the Asian-African Conference and were killed by American-Chiang Kai-shek agents.

Korin, the Beijing correspondent of the Soviet "Pravda," Bian Mianov, the head of the Beijing branch of the Soviet TASS news agency, and Jiang Xiangwei, the chief of the Chinese General Branch of the Korean Central News Agency, visited the Xinhua News Agency to express their condolences to the martyred Chinese journalists.

Telegrams of condolence to the Chinese journalistic community have been received from: the Czechoslovak News Agency, the Director of the German News Agency, Weiland, the Editor-in-Chief of the German Democratic Republic's "Neues Deutschland," Stieby, the Chairman of the Bulgarian Broadcasting Committee, Nikolov, the Director of the Albanian Broadcasting Administration, Kito, and the Editor-in-Chief of the French "l'Humanité," Stie, among others.

Isnaeni, the head of the press section of the Indonesian Embassy in China, also wrote to the All-China Journalists Association to express his condolences.

Also, the President of the All-China Journalists Association, Deng Tuo, sent telegrams to the Polish "People's Tribune" and the Austrian "Austrian People's Voice," expressing condolences for the martyrdom of the Polish journalist Starletz and the Austrian journalist Jan Fyed, who were traveling to Bandung to cover the Asian-African Conference and were killed by American-Chiang Kai-shek agents.

According to Xinhua News Agency, according to a report from the Romanian News Agency, journalists in Bucharest, the capital of the Romanian People's Republic, held a meeting on the 19th to protest the crimes of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in murdering Chinese, Polish, and Austrian journalists covering the Asian-African Conference. The resolution passed at the meeting stated that the Romanian People's Republic, together with world public opinion and colleagues from various countries, condemns the crimes of the American-Chiang Kai-shek agents. The resolution demanded that the British authorities, who bear serious responsibility for this plane crash, conduct a thorough investigation to identify, arrest, and punish the perpetrators.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, the "Pravda" published an article on the 19th by Avonin entitled "The Crude Provocation of the Enemies of Peace," denouncing the crimes of American-Chiang Kai-shek agents in murdering members of the Chinese delegation attending the Asian-African Conference. The article said that in these days, the Soviet public, along with all those who cherish peace, expressed anger at the act of American-Chiang Kai-shek agents in sabotaging the Indian plane, causing the sacrifice of members of the delegation of the People's Republic of China, members of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and journalists from China and other countries on their way to the Asian-African Conference. The Soviet people condemned this shameful murder of those whose sole purpose was to strive for the peace, freedom, and independence of the Asian and African peoples.

The article said that the masterminds of the sabotage have been exposed before the world. They have tried every means to evade responsibility, putting forward one vague and contradictory fabrication after another. But the more they fabricate, the more they cannot conceal their crimes. The article said that no matter how hard the American propagandists try, they cannot escape the facts. The American "Cold War" experts cannot eliminate the evidence of the despicable crimes.

According to Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, the "Hindustan Standard" published an editorial on the 19th saying: "The shocking facts revealed by the three survivors of the plane crash in the South China Sea last week provide initial and seemingly conclusive grounds for believing that this terrible tragedy was caused by sabotage." The editorial condemned "the despicable conspiracy of the hateful saboteurs." The editorial said that this plane crash exposed the ugly and naked essence of the Cold War. The editorial pointed out that today's Hong Kong is considered a haven for all kinds of international gangsters, in addressing the fact that the Hong Kong authorities failed to take appropriate measures to prevent this incident.

The Urdu daily "Imroz" reported on the 19th: According to reliable sources, detailed reports received in New Delhi regarding the crash of the "Kashmir Princess" confirmed earlier suspicions: the crash was caused by sabotage. It is said that when the plane left Hong Kong airport, the general impression at the airport was that the plane would crash mid-flight. There were also rumors that a time bomb had been placed on the plane and would explode within four to six hours. What is truly strange is that despite these rumors, the Hong Kong airport authorities did not take any precautions. It is feared that the work of refueling, unloading baggage, and cleaning the plane in Hong Kong was done by Chiang Kai-shek's Chinese. It is said that after the plane was cleaned and refueled, the departure time was announced, and the personnel of Air India International did not even have time to conduct an inspection. It is said that after this Indian Constellation aircraft left Hong Kong, some Chinese, said to be Chiang Kai-shek's agents, disappeared in Hong Kong.

    各国新闻工作者对殉难中外记者表示哀悼
    苏联和印度报纸斥责美蒋特务可耻的谋杀行为
    新华社十九日讯　许多国家的新闻工作者继续对前往万隆采访亚非会议新闻的中外记者由于美蒋特务的暗害而殉难，表示哀悼和愤慨。
    苏联“真理报”驻北京记者科仁、苏联塔斯社北京分社社长边缅诺夫、朝鲜中央通讯社中国总分社社长姜相渭，到新华通讯社，对殉难的中国记者表示了吊唁。
    给中国新闻界来电吊唁的有：捷克斯洛伐克通讯社、德意志通讯社社长魏兰、德意志民主共和国
  “新德意志报”总编辑斯蒂比、保加利亚广播委员会主席尼科洛夫、阿尔巴尼亚广播管理局局长基托和法国“人道报”总编辑斯梯等。
    印度尼西亚驻中国大使馆新闻处长伊斯奈尼，也写信给中国新闻工作者联谊会，表示吊唁。
    又讯　中国新闻工作者联谊会会长邓拓分别致电波兰“人民论坛报”和奥地利“奥地利人民之声报”，对前往万隆采访亚非会议新闻的波兰记者斯塔列茨和奥地利记者严斐德由于美蒋特务的暗害而殉难，表示吊唁。
    据新华社讯　据罗马尼亚通讯社消息，罗马尼亚人民共和国首都布加勒斯特的新闻工作者十九日举行会议，抗议美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮谋杀采访亚非会议的中国、波兰和奥地利记者的罪行。会议通过的决议说，罗马尼亚人民共和国同世界的公众舆论和各国的同业一起，谴责美蒋特务的罪行。决议要求对这次飞机失事事件负有严重责任的英国当局进行彻底的调查，以便查明凶手加以逮捕和惩处。
    据新华社莫斯科电　“真理报”十九日发表了阿弗宁写的一篇题为“和平敌人的粗暴挑衅”的文章，斥责美蒋特务谋杀出席亚非会议的中国代表团人员的罪行。文章说，在这些日子里，苏联公众和全体珍视和平的人们一道，对美蒋特务破坏印度飞机，使中华人民共和国代表团人员、越南民主共和国代表团人员以及中国和其他国家的记者在前往亚非会议的途中牺牲的行为表示愤怒。苏联人民斥责这种对于那些以争取亚非人民的和平、自由和独立为唯一目的的人们的可耻的谋杀行为。
    文章说，破坏行为的主谋者在全世界面前被揭穿了。他们千方百计地企图逃避责任，提出了一个接着一个的含糊不清、自相矛盾的虚构说法。但是，他们编造越多，越不能掩饰他们的罪行。文章说，不管美国的宣传家们怎样想尽办法，他们是不能逃避各种事实的。美国“冷战”专家们是无法把卑鄙的罪行的证迹消灭掉的。
    据新华社新德里电　“印度斯坦旗报”十九日发表社论说：“上星期在南中国海发生的飞机坠毁事件中的三个生还者所透露的令人震惊的情况表明：有初步的看来证据确凿的理由可以认为这次可怖的惨剧是由于破坏造成的。”社论谴责“可恨的破坏者的卑鄙阴谋”。社论说，这次飞机坠毁暴露了冷战的丑恶的赤裸裸的本质。社论在谈到香港当局没有能够采取适当的措施来防止这一事件时指出，今日的香港被认为是各色各样的国际匪徒的巢穴。
    乌尔都文日报“感化报”十九日报道：据可靠消息说，新德里得到的关于“克什米尔公主号”坠毁事件的详细报告证实了早些时候的怀疑：这次坠毁事件是由于破坏造成的。据说，在飞机离开了香港机场的时候，机场上有一般的印象，认为这架飞机会在中途失事。也有谣传说，有一颗定时炸弹放在飞机上，它会在四小时到六小时之内爆炸。真正奇怪的是，尽管有这些谣传，香港机场当局并没有采取任何预防措施。人们恐怕这架飞机在香港加燃料、放行李和打扫的工作是交由蒋介石的中国人来做的。据说，在飞机经过打扫和加燃料之后，就宣布了飞机起飞的时间，印度国际航空公司的人员甚至没有时间进行检查。据说，在这架印度星座式飞机离开香港后，有些据说是蒋介石的特务的中国人就在香港失踪了。
