Following the exposure in this newspaper on March 27th of the subjectivism and commandism errors of the leadership in Hangzhou County, Zhejiang Province, readers have further reported that the commandism in Pinghu County, Jiaxing Prefecture, Zhejiang, is even more serious than in Hangzhou County.

According to an investigation by this newspaper's Comrade Ye Jianyun: Commandism in Pinghu County is indeed very serious.

In the autumn of 1954, during the implementation of the excess production increase campaign in Pinghu County, peasants were forced to tap into their economic potential and invest in agricultural production. At that time, Li Kaiyuan, the county party secretary, estimated that peasants throughout the county had 2.77 million yuan in idle funds that could be tapped. He presided over a meeting of district and township cadres in Xincang District, where the Party Branch Secretary of Gangnan Township proposed mobilizing each household to sell silver bracelets, jewelry, and other items to purchase fertilizer. Li Kaiyuan supported this suggestion and called on each household to sell gold, silver bracelets, jewelry, and other items. Subsequently, he promoted this erroneous practice of "digging for gold and silver" as an "advanced experience" to Fuxing and Jianxin Townships. He also put forward the slogan "Turn dead wealth into living wealth." As a result of digging for dead wealth in Fuxing Township, a total of 42 taels of gold and 668 taels of silver were unearthed, and copper, iron, tinware, chickens, ducks, pigs, sheep, trees, etc., were sold for a total of 10,000 yuan. Some were forced to smash their copper and tin utensils; some even sold their cooking pots, copper spoons, iron shovels, and their daughter-in-law's earrings. After "dead wealth" was dug up in Jianxin Township, the district committee forced peasants to buy superphosphate fertilizer for their fields. Under the order of the district committee, Nanxin Village divided the fields into four grades, stipulating that each mu of first-grade land should buy five jin, second-grade land ten jin, third-grade land fifteen jin, and fourth-grade land twenty jin. Some people could not afford fertilizer and were scolded by township cadres. From July to November 1954, a series of commandism and illegal and undisciplined errors were committed in four districts and twenty-four townships of Pinghu County, leading to incidents of people being forced to death. This shows the alarming extent of commandism in Pinghu County.

The commandism of the Pinghu County Party Committee aroused widespread dissatisfaction among the masses. The county party committee saw the seriousness of the problem and had to criticize the errors of commandism. However, even after the criticism, commandism did not stop. At the end of January this year, Li Kaiyuan, on behalf of the county party committee, announced at the county party committee meeting: Li Changqing and Wang Jianting were ordered to make public self-criticisms in Maokou and Dingqiao Townships respectively, and Wang Jiaxin, a cadre of the Finance Section, was suspended from duty for self-reflection. As for what responsibilities the county party committee leadership should bear, there was no serious examination at all.

Why does Li Kaiyuan only like to punish others and not make self-criticisms? This is a concrete manifestation of Li Kaiyuan's serious subjectivism and complacency. For example, when the county party committee was discussing the excess production increase campaign, some comrades suggested studying the policies first, but Li Kaiyuan said: "Do not emphasize policies at the beginning of the campaign, otherwise the campaign will not be launched." During the campaign, some cadres reflected that the higher authorities overestimated the potential of the rural areas, and Li Kaiyuan scolded them for being right-leaning. When incidents of people being forced to death occurred, Li Kaiyuan said: "This is the law of the development of the movement(?)." When the county people's court accepted the homicide case and requested the county party committee to study and correct it, Li Kaiyuan even scolded the court for "only seeing shortcomings and not seeing achievements."

Wasn't the continuous occurrence of commandism in Pinghu County caused by Li Kaiyuan single-handedly? However, the Jiaxing Prefectural Committee has been consistently confused by Li Kaiyuan's "strong ability" and has not detected his mistakes for a long time. After Li Kaiyuan put forward the erroneous slogan of "digging for gold and silver," the prefectural committee even held a meeting of party member representatives, asking Li Kaiyuan to make a typical report at the meeting and organized a large number of cadres to visit and learn from Pinghu County, which fueled Li Kaiyuan's erroneous behavior. Li Kaiyuan's bad work style of deceiving superiors and oppressing subordinates and his absurd theories about mass movements are completely contrary to our party's ideology and work style. The CCP Jiaxing Prefectural Committee must wake up from its long-term deception, thoroughly criticize Li Kaiyuan's erroneous thinking, and seriously deal with the serious consequences caused by Li Kaiyuan.

### 中共嘉兴地委应该批判李开元的错误

    中共嘉兴地委应该批判李开元的错误
    三月二十七日本报揭发了浙江杭县领导方面的主观主义和强迫命令的错误以后，接着又有读者反映了浙江嘉兴专区平湖县的强迫命令比起杭县来还要严重。
    据本报叶剑韵同志调查了解：平湖县的强迫命令的确是十分严重的。
    一九五四年秋季，平湖县在贯彻超额增产运动中，强迫农民挖掘经济潜力投入农业生产。当时县委书记李开元估计，全县农民手里有两百七十七万元游资可以挖掘。他在新仓区主持区、乡干部会议，会上，港南乡支部书记提议动员每户变卖银镯、首饰等物件，购买肥料。李开元支持了这个意见。并号召每户变卖金子、银镯首饰等物件；接着他把这种“挖金挖银”的错误作法当成“先进经验”，向复兴和建新两乡广泛传播。并且提出了“变死财为活财”的口号。复兴乡挖掘死财的结果，共挖掘黄金四十二两，白银六百六十八两，变卖铜、铁、锡器和鸡、鸭、猪、羊、树木等共计一万元。有的被逼砸碎了铜、锡用具；有的连做饭的铁锅、铜勺、铁铲和儿媳妇的耳环也卖掉了。建新乡在挖掘“死财”以后，区委强迫农民购买过磷酸钙肥田。南新村在区委的命令下，把田分成四等，规定一等田每亩要买五斤，二等田每亩要买十斤，三等田十五斤，四等田二十斤。有的人买不起肥料，就遭到乡干部的责骂。一九五四年七月到十一月，平湖县四个区二十四个乡都犯有一系列的强迫命令和违法乱纪的错误，直至发生逼死人命的事件。可见平湖县的强迫命令到了何等惊人的地步。
    平湖县委强迫命令的结果激起了群众的普遍不满。县委看到问题严重，不得不批判一下强迫命令的错误。但是，批判以后，强迫命令还没有停止。今年一月底，李开元代表县委在县委会上宣布：责成李长清、王建廷分别到泖口、丁桥二乡作公开检讨，财政科干部王家鑫停职反省，至于县委领导上该负什么责任，根本没有认真地检查。
    为什么李开元只喜欢处分别人，不作自我检讨呢？这是李开元有着严重的主观主义和骄傲自满的情绪的具体表现。如县委在讨论超额增产运动时，有的同志提出先研究一下政策，但李开元却说：运动开始时不要强调政策，否则运动就开展不起来。在运动过程中有的干部反映上级对农村的潜力估计过高，李开元就责骂他们是右倾思想。在发生了逼死人命的事件时，李开元却说：这是运动发展的规律（？）。当县人民法院受理人命案件提请县委研究纠正时，李开元竟斥责法院：只看缺点，不看成绩。
    平湖县的强迫命令所以不断发生，难道不是李开元一手造成的吗？但是中共嘉兴地委一贯迷惑于李开元的能力强，而对他的错误长期没有发觉。当李开元提出“挖金挖银”的错误口号以后，地委还召开了党员代表大会，要李开元在会上作了典型报告，并组织了大批干部去平湖县参观学习，这就助长了李开元的错误行为。李开元欺上压下的恶劣作风和他对群众运动的荒谬理论，是和我们党的思想作风完全相违背的。中共嘉兴地委必须从长期蒙蔽中清醒过来，彻底批判李开元的错误思想，并严肃处理李开元所制造的严重恶果。
