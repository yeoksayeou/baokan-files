Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd—According to TASS reports: On April 1st, a vigorous signature campaign for the World Peace Council's appeal to the people of the world against the threat of atomic war was launched across the Soviet Union. From the Pacific coast to the Baltic coast, from the Pamirs to the Far North, mass rallies were held successively in cities and villages throughout the country. The working people participating in the conferences angrily condemned the imperialists' plot to threaten mankind with atomic war, demonstrated the Soviet people's firm will to defend world peace, and signed the appeal to the people of the world.

In Moscow, at a rally in a workshop of the "Hammer and Sickle" steel factory, steelworker Gorelov said: We are engaged in peaceful labor, creating wealth for human happiness. Our hands are not only good at making steel and growing crops, but also, when necessary, we can take up arms. At a staff meeting at the Three Hills Textile Factory, foreman assistant Rumyantsev said: In our country, you can't find a single person who isn't wholeheartedly standing with peace defenders from other countries. Anyone who dares to infringe on our territory will be met with devastating retaliation.

Writers in Moscow also held a gathering, unanimously supporting the World Peace Council's appeal to the people of the world. Writer A. Chaikovsky said at the meeting: Writers will strengthen the power of the great Soviet Union with their creative labor. We stand at the forefront of the ranks loudly defending peace and the happiness of all mankind.

In Leningrad, tens of thousands of people signed the appeal to the people of the world on April 1st alone. Many industrial enterprises held signature rallies. Forger Seraphimovich said at a staff meeting at the Kirov Factory: We must all sign our names on the appeal to the people of the world as one person. Those atomic war provocateurs should be kept in line, and the Paris Agreement and the plan to revive the German Wehrmacht must not be allowed to be realized.

In Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, forger Kuleiko of the "Lenin Manufacturing Plant" shipyard said at a factory-wide workers' meeting: All of us advocate banning atomic weapons and other types of large-scale weapons of destruction, but this does not mean that we fear the threats of the atomic madmen in Washington and London. Aggressors have seen more than once what indestructible power the Soviet people possess. Let our signature be a serious warning to those who attempt to launch a new war!

The workers of the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant, which manufactures huge engines and machines for the main sectors of Soviet industry, warmly supported the appeal to the people of the world. Miller Bobylev said: The Soviet people, together with all peace-loving people, are working hard to stop the outbreak of war. We must consolidate the strength of our motherland and further develop the foundation of our economy - heavy industry.

"Don't let war happen!" – this was the unanimous cry of agricultural workers from many collective farms, state farms and machine tractor stations at signature rallies across the country. At a meeting of collective farm members in Mervino Village, Lysen District, young milkmaid Davidkina said that the Soviet people particularly cherish peace. Those who build do not want destruction. Those who defend peace will never allow war profiteers to throw people into new slaughter.

    向原子狂人发出了严重警告
    苏联展开签名运动反对原子战争
    新华社二日讯　据塔斯社报道：四月一日，苏联各地蓬勃地展开了为世界和平理事会反对原子战争威胁的告全世界人民书征集签名的运动。从太平洋岸边到波罗的海沿岸，从帕米尔到极北地区，全国各城市和乡村都相继举行群众大会。参加大会的劳动人民愤怒地谴责帝国主义者用原子战争来威胁人类的阴谋，表示了苏联人民保卫世界和平的坚强意志，并且在告全世界人民书上签了名。
    在莫斯科，在“镰刀与锤子”钢铁工厂一个车间的集会上，炼钢工人戈列洛夫说：我们从事于和平劳动，为人的幸福创造财富。我们的双手不仅善于炼钢，善于种庄稼，而且一旦在必要时，我们还能够拿起武器。在三山纺织工厂的职工大会上，领班助理鲁米扬泽夫说：在我们的国家里，找不到一个不是全心全意地同其他国家的和平保卫者站在一道的人。任何胆敢侵犯我国领土的人，都将遭到毁灭性的反击。
    莫斯科市的作家也举行集会，一致支持世界和平理事会告全世界人民书。作家亚·柴可夫斯基在会上说：作家将以自己创造性的劳动来加强伟大的苏联的威力。我们站在大声疾呼地保卫和平和全人类幸福的行列的前面。
    在列宁格勒，在四月一日一天内，有数以万计的人在告全世界人民书上签了名。许多工业企业都举行了签名大会。锻工绥拉菲莫维奇在基洛夫工厂职工大会上说：我们大家要像一个人一样在告全世界人民书上签上自己的名字。应该叫那些原子战争的挑拨者规矩一点，不能让巴黎协定和复活德国国防军的计划实现。
    在乌克兰首都基辅，“列宁制造场”造船厂的锻工库列伊科在全厂工人大会上说：我们所有的人都主张禁止原子武器和其他类型的大规模毁灭性武器，但是，这并不等于说，我们惧怕华盛顿和伦敦的原子狂人的威胁。侵略者不止一次地看到过苏联人民具有怎样不可摧毁的力量。让我们的签名成为对那些企图发动新战争的人的严重警告吧！
    为苏联工业的主要部门制造巨大的联动机和机器的乌拉尔重型机器制造厂的工人，热烈拥护告全世界人民书。铣工波比列夫说：苏联人同所有爱好和平的人们一起，正在努力制止战争的发生。我们要巩固我们祖国的力量，更进一步发展我们经济的基础——重工业。
    “不要让战争发生！”——这是全国许多集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站的农业劳动者在签名大会上所发出的一致的呼声。在利森州梅尔维诺村的集体农庄庄员大会上，年轻的挤奶女工达维德金娜说，苏联人民是特别珍爱和平的。建设的人不希望破坏。保卫和平的人决不容许战争贩子把人民投入新的屠杀中。
