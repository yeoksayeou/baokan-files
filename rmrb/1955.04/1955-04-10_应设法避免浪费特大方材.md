To the Editorial Comrades:

    In the past, the Northeast Timber Industry Bureau supplied a large proportion of extra-large timber to the entire country. Last year alone, it amounted to approximately 470,000 cubic meters, and this year's planned production is even higher than last year's. Extra-large timber is a semi-finished product, and the departments requiring the material have to re-process it after receiving it, which easily leads to waste.

    Extra-large timber has larger specifications. After being sawn, it goes through eight or nine loading and unloading operations from the sawmill to being loaded onto the train. Because the wood is too heavy, force must be used to drive the hook blade into the material, so when the extra-large timber arrives at the material-needing unit, the wood is full of six- to seven-centimeter hook marks on all sides. As a result, the material-using units have to cut off a five-centimeter board from all sides of this valuable wood. If we calculate based on an annual production of 500,000 cubic meters of extra-large timber, the loss amounts to approximately 4.5 million yuan.

    Such waste can be avoided. The ways to avoid it are: (1) Appropriately increase the installation of mechanical loading and stacking machines. I have made a preliminary calculation that if all the lumber mills were converted to mechanical loading and stacking, the cost would be much less than the annual loss of 4.5 million yuan. Of course, it is difficult for the state to allocate this huge sum of money at once, but it should be possible to solve it gradually. (2) Combine with the current work, mobilize workers to use their brains to find solutions. As long as the workers understand the significance of solving this problem, it can definitely be solved.

    应设法避免浪费特大方材编辑同志：
    东北制材工业管理局过去供应全国的成材中，特大方材占的比重很大，去年一年约达四十七万立方公尺，而今年的计划生产量比去年还要多。特大方材是一种半制成品，需材部门领回去以后还要重新加工，因此很容易造成浪费。
    特大方材的规格较大，下锯以后，由锯木车间到装上火车要经过八、九次的搬勾抬勾作业。因为木材体积过重，便不得不用力将勾刃打入材内，所以当特大方材运到需材单位时，木材四面都是六、七公分的勾眼。这样，用材单位便不得不把这些贵重的木材四面割去一块五分板。如果以全年生产五十万立方公尺特大方材计算，损失约达四百五十万元。
    这样的浪费是可以避免的。避免的办法是：（一）适当地增设机械装车垛机。我曾经初步计算了一下，如果把全部制材厂都改为机械装车归垛，这项费用比每年损失四百五十万元要少得多。当然一时要国家拨出这笔巨款是有困难的，但逐步地加以解决应该说是可能的。（二）结合当前工作，发动工人动脑筋想办法加以解决。只要工人群众认识到解决这个问题的意义，就一定可以解决。
