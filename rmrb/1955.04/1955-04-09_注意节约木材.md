    Pay Attention to Conserving Timber
  　Li Qian
    Timber is very useful in our country's entire economic construction. Our country's timber resources are insufficient, but at present, there are still many unreasonable phenomena in timber harvesting, processing, and use.
    In terms of timber harvesting, some cadres, seeing the boundless forests around them, believe that they are "inexhaustible and inexhaustible." For the sake of convenient harvesting, they only selectively harvest good timber and do not pay much attention to the utilization of broad-leaved trees. In terms of timber processing, the yield rate of many enterprises is very low, and the waste materials from timber production are not well utilized. For example, in order to produce more first-class timber, some logging yards and timber mills treat curved wood that is not very curved and does not affect use, and can be made into second-class or third-class timber, as waste. Although some timber mills have organized waste processing workshops to produce box boards and gray strips, there are too few users of waste products, resulting in a large backlog. In terms of timber use, from the aspects of basic construction sites, coal mines (pit props), railways (sleepers), and papermaking (wood pulp), which have the largest consumption, there are considerable serious waste phenomena. For example, in basic construction, the phenomenon of over-receiving and under-using, using large materials for small purposes, using long materials for short purposes, and using high-quality materials for low-quality purposes is very common, and bamboo is used instead of wood where it could be. The railway has not done enough to prevent corrosion of sleepers, which has shortened the service life of sleepers. In terms of coal mines, except for a few mines that have strengthened the management of pit props and paid attention to conservation, in general, they still lack due attention to the storage, anti-corrosion, substitution, and recycling of pit props. In terms of papermaking, many paper mills are unwilling to use more bark and do not do a good job in recycling waste paper, rags, hemp rope ends, etc., which increases the consumption of wood.
    To solve the problem of insufficient timber, in addition to large-scale afforestation and strengthening site renewal to expand forest resources, the most important thing at present is to conserve timber in all aspects and overcome the waste of timber. First of all, in the basic construction departments, in addition to improving the use and management of timber and uniformly implementing contracting materials and labor, the main thing is to widely promote the standard design of dormitories, schools, offices, and hospitals. Because the above-mentioned buildings account for a large proportion of the total construction area, and most of them use brick-wood structures and mixed structures, which use the most wood, the adoption of standard design can greatly process wood, which can use wood more rationally. At the same time, broad-leaved wood should be used as much as possible where broad-leaved wood can be used, because broad-leaved trees grow faster than coniferous trees. Using bamboo instead of wood in basic construction as much as possible is also an important method of saving wood. Bamboo is one of the most produced building materials in our country. There are about twelve provinces in the country that produce bamboo, with an annual output of about 150 million dan. The tensile and compressive strength of bamboo is more than twice that of pine and fir. Temporary construction projects on general basic construction sites, such as construction site offices, warehouses, and sheds, can use bamboo materials except for doors, windows, and floors. If the whole country uses bamboo for sheds, bamboo scaffolding, and bamboo footboards, it is estimated that 400,000 to 600,000 cubic meters of wood can be saved every year. At the same time, it can also reduce project costs.
    Secondly, it is necessary to save the wood needed for coal mine pit props. The experience of many advanced mines proves that as long as the management of pit props is truly strengthened and substitutes are actively adopted, it is entirely possible to save a large amount of pit props. For example, the Beipiao Mining Bureau implemented a three-level responsibility system for pit prop quota management, which saved a lot of timber for the country. In terms of pit prop anticorrosion, peeling pit props can extend their service life by 30% to 40%, and soaking pit props in lime water can double their service life. If concrete sheds are promoted in coal mines across the country, according to preliminary statistics, 720 cubic meters of pit props can be saved in a 1,000-meter roadway. Huainan Coal Mine uses bamboo fences instead of boards, which is both safe and economical. In terms of pit prop recovery, after the Fuxin Mining Bureau implemented the rational recovery of roof pit props, the pit prop recovery rate increased from the original 40% to 50% to 80% to 93%. This not only saves pit props but also reduces coal mining costs.
    Third, in terms of railways, it is first necessary to strengthen the anti-corrosion work of railway sleepers, actively increase anti-corrosion equipment, and gradually strive to ensure that all sleepers used in the current year are anti-corrosion treated. In addition, the work of bundling, recovering, and reusing sleepers should also be strengthened.
    Fourth, in terms of papermaking, a large amount of waste paper, rags, hemp rope ends, and other papermaking raw materials should be recycled, and bark, reeds, and small-diameter wood should be widely used as papermaking raw materials. In addition, using sawdust to press boards and manufacture alcohol, according to relevant departments' statistics: if sawdust equivalent to 1 million cubic meters of wood is used to press boards, 600,000 cubic meters of wood can be produced. Promoting the use of waste materials to make plywood, wood fiberboard, parquet flooring, furniture, toys, etc. can also save wood.

    注意节约木材
  　李茜
    木材在我国整个经济建设中的用处很大。我国的木材资源不足，但目前在木材的采伐、加工和使用等方面，还存在着许多不合理现象。
    在木材采伐方面，有些干部看到周围有一望无际的森林，就认为是“取之不尽、用之不竭”，为了采伐的方便，只择伐好木材，对阔叶树的利用很不重视。在木材加工方面，许多企业的出材率很低，而且对制材生产中的废料没有很好地利用。如有些伐木场和制材厂为了多造一等材，把弯子不大、不影响使用的能造二等材或三等材的弯木也当成废料。有些制材厂虽组织了废料加工车间，生产箱板和灰条，但废料制品的用户太少，因而大量积压。在木材使用方面，从用量最大的基本建设工地、煤井（坑木）、铁路（枕木）及造纸（木浆）等几个方面来看，都有相当严重的浪费现象。例如：在基本建设中多领少用，大材小用，长材短用，优材劣用的情形很普遍，可以用竹子代替的也用了木材。铁路上对于枕木防腐工作做得不够普遍，因此也缩短了枕木使用寿命。在煤矿方面，除少数矿山加强了坑木的管理，注意了节约外，一般对坑木的保管、防腐、代用和回收等工作还缺乏应有的注意。在造纸方面，许多造纸厂不愿多用板皮，对废纸、破布、麻绳头等回收工作也做得不好，这就增加了木料的消耗。
    要解决木材不足的问题，除大规模地进行造林，加强迹地更新以扩大林源外，目前最重要的是从各方面节约木材，克服使用木材的浪费现象。首先，在基本建设部门，除改进对木材的使用、管理和统一实行包工包料的办法外，主要是广泛推行宿舍、学校、办公室、医院的标准设计。因为以上几项建筑在整个建筑面积中的比重很大，并且绝大部分又都是使用木材最多的砖木结构和混合结构，因此，采用标准设计后，可以大量地进行木材加工，因而就能更合理地使用木材。同时，凡可以用阔叶树木材的要尽量使用阔叶树木材，因为阔叶树的成长比针叶树快。在基本建设中尽可能用竹材代替木材，也是节约木材的一个重要方法。竹是我国出产最多的建筑材料之一，全国约有十二个省份产竹，年产量约有一亿五千万市担。竹材的抗拉、抗压能力都优于松木和杉木两倍以上。一般基本建设工地的暂建工程如工地办公室、仓库、工棚等除门窗地板外，都可利用竹材。如果全国都用竹做工棚、竹脚手架、竹脚手板，估计每年可以节约四十至六十万立方公尺木材。同时，还可以减少工程造价。
    其次，要节约煤矿坑木需用的木材。许多先进矿山的经验证明，只要真正加强坑木管理工作，并积极采用代用品，节约大量坑木是完全可能的。如北票矿务局实行坑木定额管理的三级责任制后，为国家节省了大量木材。在坑木防腐方面，将坑木剥皮后可延长使用寿命百分之三十至四十，将坑木浸石灰水后可延长使用寿命一倍。如果全国煤矿推广混凝土棚子，据初步统计，在一千公尺巷道中，就可节省坑木七百二十立方公尺。淮南煤矿以竹笆代替板材，既安全又节省。在坑木回收方面，阜新矿务局实行顶板坑木合理回收后，坑木回收率由原来的百分之四十至五十提高到百分之八十至九十三。这样不但节省了坑木，而且降低了采煤成本。
    第三、在铁路方面，首先要加强铁路枕木防腐工作，积极增加防腐设备，逐步争取当年所用枕木全部防腐。另外，还应加强枕木捆头、回收、复用工作。
    第四、在造纸方面，应大量回收废纸、破布、麻绳头等造纸原料，并广泛使用板皮、苇子和小径材作造纸原料。此外，利用锯屑压制板材和制造酒精，据有关部门统计：如利用相当于一百万立方公尺木材的锯屑来压制板材，可出材六十万立方公尺。推广废料制胶合板、木丝板、拼花地板、家具、玩具等，也可以节省木材。
