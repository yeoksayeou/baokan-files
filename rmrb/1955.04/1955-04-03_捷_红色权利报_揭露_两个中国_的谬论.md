Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 1st: The "Red Rights Newspaper" said on March 30th that the deceptive theory of "two Chinas" proves the double-dealing tactics of the British ruling group on the Taiwan issue, because this theory of Britain's actually supports the United States' policy of occupying Taiwan as a war base for attacking China. The newspaper also said: "The U.S. ruling group's mild attitude on the 'two Chinas' issue is merely a tactic aimed at winning over its allies, especially deceiving the public in capitalist countries, and creating the impression that Western countries are striving for peace in the Taiwan Strait."

The newspaper pointed out, when discussing Dulles' recent speech, that the purpose of American policy is not only to occupy Taiwan, but also to use Taiwan and other islands as favorable war bases to launch a war against China.

The newspaper continued, all the political tricks, coupled with the Kuomintang bandit gang's air raids on the mainland and the U.S. military exercises, prove that the only way to eliminate the dangerous war flashpoint in the Taiwan area is to return the island to China, let the Chinese people exercise their national and legitimate rights, and fulfill the obligations that the United States also undertook in the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation. Only in this way can peace in the region be restored and peace in the Far East be consolidated.

The newspaper also said that as long as the proponents of the U.S. "policy of strength" occupy Taiwan, as long as Chiang Kai-shek is entrenched in Taiwan, peace cannot be guaranteed, just as nothing can save Chiang Kai-shek from being driven out of the mainland, and nothing can change his final fate. "Taiwan is and will always be China's," "Red Rights Newspaper" concluded.

    捷“红色权利报”揭露“两个中国”的谬论
    新华社布拉格一日电　“红色权利报”三月三十日说，关于“两个中国”的骗人理论证明了英国统治集团在台湾问题上的两面手腕，因为英国的这个理论实际上就是支持美国的霸占台湾作为进攻中国的战争基地的政策。这家报纸又说：“美国统治集团对‘两个中国’问题的温和态度仅仅是一种策略，目的是：拉拢它们的盟国，特别是欺骗资本主义国家中的公众，并且制造这样一种印象，好像西方国家正在努力谋求台湾海峡的和平似的。”
    这家报纸在谈到杜勒斯最近发表的谈话时指出，美国政策的目的不仅是霸占台湾，而且是以台湾和其他岛屿作为有利的战争基地来对中国发动战争。
    这家报纸接着说道，所有政治花样配合着国民党匪帮空袭大陆和美国军队的演习，都证明消除台湾地区的危险的战争焦点的唯一道路，就是把这个岛屿交还中国、让中国人民行使他们的民族和合法权利、履行美国也在开罗宣言和波茨坦公告中所承担的义务。只有这样，这个地区的和平才能恢复，远东的和平才能巩固。
    这家报纸又说，只要美国的“实力政策”的主张者霸占着台湾，只要蒋介石还盘踞在台湾，和平就不能得到保证，正好像任何事情都不能使蒋介石免于被赶出大陆，任何事情都不能改变他的最后命运一样。“红色权利报”最后说：“台湾是而且将永远是中国的。”
