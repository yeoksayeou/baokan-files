Xinhua News Agency, April 1st Dispatch from New York (TASS): According to American newspapers, the 50th Representative Meeting of the United Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, a union with over 100,000 members, concluded a few days ago in Spokane, Washington. The main purpose of the meeting was to mobilize the masses to fight for political rights. The Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers is one of the most militant unions in the American labor movement and is currently being persecuted by the American government.

In his report to the meeting, the union president, John Clark, pointed out the achievements of the Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers in the political struggle of 1954 and said: The Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers have proven that conducting independent political activities is the right path to take at present. Clark denounced the attitude of those unions that fawn upon bourgeois political parties and demanded the abolition of the reactionary Smith Act and Taft-Hartley Act, the abolition of the Walter-McCarran Act, and the fascist bills prohibiting communist activities. He emphasized that union organizations must enjoy complete freedom of action.

The meeting passed a resolution severely condemning the persecution of the union's organizers by the American government.

The meeting also passed a resolution advocating the easing of international tensions and holding talks aimed at resolving world problems, and demanding "immediate five-power negotiations with China participating to seek solutions to all major differences."

Xinhua News Agency, April 1st Dispatch from Washington (TASS): The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee continues to discuss the Paris Accords.

At the committee's March 30th meeting, representatives from the New Jersey state organizations of the American Labor Party, the Progressive Party, the "American Veterans for Peace," and other organizations strongly opposed the rearmament of West Germany and demanded a four-power conference.

Paul Green, a representative of "American Veterans for Peace," said that a rearmed West Germany is a serious threat to peace. Green said: "Can we, who have tasted the bitterness at the hands of German fascists, support and promote this act of reviving German Nazism? This rearmament will be a suicidal act. History is a good teacher. Hitler also said that he would be satisfied only with unifying Germany, but the greed of German militarism led to the Second World War and the deaths of thirty million people. We have ample evidence that the current West German leaders, who were once Hitler's aides, will do the same if given the opportunity." Green suggested holding a great power conference to peacefully resolve outstanding international issues.

Maurice Goldton, Executive Secretary of the New York Party Organization of the American Labor Party, stated that he opposed the Paris Accords because he believed "it is contrary to our national interests and will not help ease international tensions but will contribute to creating a greater threat to peace."

Former Senator Stanley Nowak, in his speech, asked the Foreign Relations Committee to "recommend convening a four-power conference."

James Mobley, Chairman of the New Jersey State Organization of the Progressive Party, demanded that talks with the Soviet Union be held as soon as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, March 31st Dispatch from Washington (TASS): U.S. Democratic Senator Kefauver, speaking in the U.S. Senate, demanded that the U.S. government stop talking about war and strive for negotiations with the Soviet Union.

Kefauver said that those who prepare and plan for war "should know that the majority of the American people are against them. America is a completely peaceful country, no matter how hard some of our leaders try to make it a belligerent country." Kefauver pointed out that the time has come for American leaders to talk peace, "the time has come to set aside Secretary of State Dulles' full set of warmongering words and deeds."

    美国进步组织和工会要求举行大国会谈
    强烈反对重新武装德国法西斯分子的巴黎协定
    新华社一日讯　据塔斯社纽约消息：据美国报纸报道，拥有十多万会员的美国开采、冶炼工人工会第五十届代表会议几天前在华盛顿州的斯波康城闭幕。会议的主要目的是动员群众争取政治权利。开采、冶炼工人工会在美国劳工运动中是最有战斗性的工会之一，因而目前正遭到美国政府的迫害。
    工会主席约翰·克拉克在向会议所作的报告中指出了开采、冶炼工人一九五四年的政治斗争的成就，并且说：开采、冶炼工人已经证明：进行独立的政治活动是目前应该走的恰当道路。克拉克斥责那些谄媚资产阶级政党的工会的态度，并且要求废除反动的史密斯法和塔夫脱—哈特莱法，废除华尔特—麦卡伦法和禁止共产党活动的法西斯法案。他强调工会组织必须享有完全的行动自由。
    会议通过一项严厉谴责美国政府对这个工会的组织者进行迫害的决议。
    会议还通过了一项决议，主张缓和国际紧张局势和举行目的在于解决世界问题的会谈，并且要求“立即举行有中国参加的五大国谈判，以谋求解决一切重大的分歧”。
    新华社一日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿讯：美国参议院外交委员会继续讨论巴黎协定。
    在委员会三月三十日的会议上，美国劳工党、进步党新泽西州党组织、“美国退役军人争取和平协会”以及其他一些组织的代表们都强烈反对重新武装西德，并且要求举行四国会议。
    “美国退役军人争取和平协会”代表保罗·格林说，一个重新武装的西德是对和平的一个严重威胁。格林说：“在德国法西斯分子手中尝过苦头的我们，能够支持和促进这种复活德国纳粹主义的行动吗？这种重新武装的行动将是自杀行动。历史是一个很好的教师。希特勒也说过，他只要统一德国就满足了，但是德国军国主义的贪欲导致了第二次世界大战和三千万人的死亡。我们有充分的证据证明，曾经是希特勒的助手的目前的西德领袖们如果得到机会，将会作出同样的事来。”格林建议举行一次大国会议来和平解决悬而未决的国际问题。
    美国劳工党纽约党组织执行书记莫里斯·戈尔顿表示他反对巴黎协定，因为他认为“它是违反我们的民族利益的，它将无助于缓和国际紧张局势而有助于制造对和平的更大威胁”。
    前参议员斯坦莱·诺瓦克在他的发言中要求外交委员会“建议召开四国会议”。
    进步党新泽西州党组织主席詹姆斯·莫布里要求尽速同苏联举行会谈。
    新华社一日讯　塔斯社华盛顿三月三十一日讯：美国民主党参议员克弗维尔在美国参议院发言，要求美国政府停止谈论战争，争取同苏联谈判。
    克弗维尔说，准备和计划战争的人“应该知道，美国大多数人民是反对他们的。美国是完全和平的国家，不管我们某些领导者怎样竭力想使它成为好战的国家”。克弗维尔指出，美国的领导者们应该谈和平的时候到了，“应该把国务卿杜勒斯的全副好战言行搁置一旁的时候到了”。
