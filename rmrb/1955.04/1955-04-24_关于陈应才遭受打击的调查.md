To the Editor:

    Under the leadership of the CPC Qiqihar Municipal Committee and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, we conducted an investigation into the case of Zhou Yuxue, the Party General Branch Secretary of the Machinery and Wood Factory of the Second Engineering Company of the Heilongjiang Provincial Construction Department, who persecuted and framed worker Chen Yingcai. The investigation proved that the situation reflected by Chen Yingcai was true. Chen Yingcai previously worked in the Heihe area and had created five types of operating machines. At the end of 1953, he was评为awarded the title of Special-Grade Labor Model of the province. In November 1953, he was transferred to the Provincial Machinery and Wood Factory, where he served as the leader of the woodworking mortise group in the Second Workshop. Because of his active work, he continued to be rated as an advanced producer in the factory. From January to May 1954, the factory leadership decided to have Chen Yingcai use scrap wood to conduct trial production of new products. During the trial production process, Chen Yingcai was积极肯干active and willing to work hard, studying diligently, and produced 24,000 black tiles for the Provincial Workers and Peasants Cultural School, for which he received an award from the school.

    The main reason why Chen Yingcai was not rated as a model worker in the winter of 1954 and was removed from his position as a propagandist was due to the fact that the factory director郝光农Hao Guangnong and the General Branch Secretary Zhou Yuxue were working independently in their work and were not united. Zhou Yuxue's attack on Chen Yingcai was actually a confrontation with factory director Hao Guangnong.

    Many comrades in the Party General Branch Committee and the Model Evaluation Committee had opinions on Zhou Yuxue's behavior of attacking Chen Yingcai, but Zhou Yuxue never considered or accepted everyone's opinions. Instead, he distorted the facts and reported to the company leaders that "Chen Yingcai is superficially compliant but secretly resistant, and his title of labor model in 1953 was obtained by deception..." He even blamed some wasteful phenomena in the trial production of new products on Chen Yingcai without any basis.

    According to our understanding, errors such as suppressing criticism and acting subjectively, like those of Party General Branch Secretary Zhou Yuxue, also seriously exist among some members of the Party General Branch Committee in the wood factory. We suggest that the Party Committee of the Second Engineering Company of the Heilongjiang Provincial Construction Department immediately conduct a serious inspection of the problems existing in the collective leadership of the Party General Branch Committee of the Machinery and Wood Factory, and give Zhou Yuxue the necessary punishment for his mistakes.

### 关于陈应才遭受打击的调查

    关于陈应才遭受打击的调查编辑同志：
    在中共齐齐哈尔市委会和市工会的领导下，我们对黑龙江省建设厅第二工程公司机械木工厂党总支书记周玉学，打击和陷害木工陈应才的事件进行了调查。证明陈应才所反映的情况是真实的。陈应才原在黑河专区工作，曾创造了五种作业机，一九五三年底被评为省特等劳动模范。一九五三年十一月调来省机械木工厂，在第二车间当木工打眼组组长。由于他工作积极，继续被评为厂的先进生产者。一九五四年一月至五月间，工厂领导上决定陈应才用碎木进行新产品的试制工作。陈应才在试制过程中，积极肯干，苦心钻研，给省工农文化学校制作了两万四千块黑龙瓦，受到了学校的奖励。
    一九五四年冬季，陈应才所以没有被评为模范，并被撤销了宣传员的工作，主要是厂长郝光农和总支书记周玉学在工作中各自为政，互不团结所造成的。周玉学对陈应才的打击，实际上是对厂长郝光农的对抗。
    党总支委员会和评模委员会的好多同志对周玉学打击陈应才的行为都有意见，但周玉学始终没有考虑和接受大家的意见，反而歪曲事实向公司领导汇报说：“陈应才阳奉阴违，一九五三年劳动模范的称号，是骗来的……。”甚至将试制新产品过程中某些浪费现象，都毫无根据地推到陈应才的身上。
    据我们了解，在木工厂像党总支书记周玉学这种压制批评、主观行事的错误，在党总支委员会的部分委员中也严重地存在着。我们建议黑龙江省建设厅第二工程公司党委会，立即对机械木工厂党总支委员会在集体领导方面存在的问题，进行认真的检查，对于周玉学的错误给予必要的处分。
