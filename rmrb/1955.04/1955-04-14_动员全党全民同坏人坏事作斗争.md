    Consolidating Party discipline and seriously examining and handling incidents of Party members violating Party discipline is a serious political task. This is a struggle of proletarian ideology against bourgeois ideology and other non-proletarian ideologies, a guarantee of the unity of the Party's will and action, and a guarantee of the Party's close ties with the masses. Lenin said: "Anyone who even slightly weakens the iron discipline within the proletarian party (especially during the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat) is in fact helping the bourgeoisie against the proletariat." This principle is also fully applicable to the People's Democratic Dictatorship of the People's Republic of China. The National Conference of the Communist Party of China decided to establish central and local supervisory committees to replace the current discipline inspection committees, in order to strengthen Party discipline, strengthen the struggle against various violations of law and discipline among Party members, and especially to prevent the recurrence of events like the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance, which seriously endanger the interests of the Party. This is necessary and timely.
    The resolution of the National Conference of the Party pointed out that whether it is foreign imperialists or domestic counter-revolutionaries, they all know that the most effective way to attack the Chinese people is to first attack the leading force of the Chinese people and the Chinese working class—the Communist Party of China. Therefore, they are constantly looking for opportunities to launch open and covert attacks on our Party. Under this situation of class struggle, some wavering and unreliable elements within the Party cannot withstand the erosion of bourgeois ideology, and thus violate laws and discipline, and even degenerate. Although some of these facts have been exposed and dealt with, there are still more that have not been exposed, or although they have been exposed, they have not been dealt with in a timely and serious manner. Continuing to tolerate this situation will only benefit the enemies of the Party and the people, and will only cause harm to the people's democratic dictatorship and socialist cause.
    In order to carry out a thorough and effective struggle against these bad people and bad deeds, we must not only rely on the strengthening of the general political and organizational work of the Party and state organs, but also on the strengthening of the specialized supervision organs of the Party and the state; we must not only rely on the joint efforts of all active elements of the Party, but also on the joint efforts of all active elements among the people of the whole country.
    The Party's supervisory committee is a specialized supervisory organ within the Party to fight against bad people and bad deeds. According to the resolution of the National Conference of the Party, the Party's supervisory committees at all levels work under the guidance of the Party committees at all levels, and they have the right to examine and handle all cases of Party members violating the Party Constitution, Party discipline, and state laws and decrees. If members of Party committees at all levels violate the Party Constitution, Party discipline, and state laws and decrees, they should be dealt with by the Party committee at the same level; however, the higher-level Party supervisory committee has the right to directly deal with them when it deems it necessary. When the local Party supervisory committees at all levels are inspecting members of the higher-level Party committee and members of the Party committee at the same level, and when giving cadres within the list of cadre positions managed by the higher-level and same-level Party committees penalties of removal from work or higher, they should separately obtain the consent of the higher-level and same-level Party committees; however, if the local supervisory committee believes that the decision of the same-level Party committee is inappropriate, it has the right to appeal to the next higher-level Party committee. From this, it can be seen that the Party's supervisory committee has broader powers than the original Party's discipline inspection committees at all levels. The original discipline inspection committees at all levels were completely managed by the Party committee at the same level and had no right to directly intervene in the work of the discipline inspection committees of the lower-level Party committees. Therefore, if the Party committee attaches importance to the Party's discipline work and can strictly abide by the Party's discipline as an example, then the work of the discipline inspection committee under the leadership of this Party committee will be better; if this is not the case, then the work of the discipline inspection committee under the leadership of this Party committee will be difficult to do well. The original Discipline Inspection Committee of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee is an example. This discipline inspection committee was under the leadership of the anti-Party element Gao Gang, and his followers Zhang Xiushan, Chen Bocun, and Guo Feng also served as the secretary and deputy secretaries of this committee. Therefore, this discipline inspection committee could not inspect Gao Gang's anti-Party activities and could not work in accordance with the principles of the Party. Similarly, Xiang Ming, the acting secretary of the original Shandong Branch of the CPC Central Committee, not only stubbornly restricted the work of the branch's discipline inspection committee, but also "drove out of Shandong" the staff sent by the Central Discipline Inspection Committee. This clearly shows the necessity of establishing the Party's supervisory committee to replace the discipline inspection committee.
    When fighting against bad people and bad deeds, the Party's supervisory committee should not only rely on a few staff members; no matter how hard a few staff members work, their role is limited after all. The Party's supervisory committee must not only be good at establishing close cooperation with the state procuratorial organs and government supervisory organs, but also be good at mobilizing the enthusiasm of all Party members and all patriotic citizens to fight against bad people and bad deeds. The past organization of the discipline inspection committee was too small, and it lacked open and direct contact with the broad masses inside and outside the Party, which was also one of the reasons why its work was restricted. The Party's resolution on the establishment of the supervisory committee stipulates: "All Party members have the obligation to report to the Party's supervisory committee the situation of Party members violating laws and discipline that they know of, and to help the Party's supervisory committee fight against Party members who violate the Party Constitution, Party discipline, and state laws and decrees." The resolution also stipulates: "The Party's central and local supervisory committees at all levels must maintain regular contact with the trade unions, the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, the supervisory committees of cooperatives, and other mass organizations at all levels, and rely on these organizations to contact the broad masses to carry out work." These regulations create favorable conditions for mobilizing the broad masses inside and outside the Party to oppose the struggle against bad people and bad deeds.
    In order to expose and crack down on bad people and bad deeds in a timely and effective manner, it is necessary to emphasize the promotion of mass accusations. The words "bad element" are not engraved on the heads of bad elements, and they will also use various means to cover up the bad things they have done. Therefore, relying solely on top-down inspections often cannot discover or cannot fully discover their true faces. However, as the saying goes, "If you don't want others to know, don't do it yourself." Someone is always harmed by a person doing bad things, and someone always knows. As long as bottom-up accusations are widely promoted and the accusers are seriously protected from retaliation, then bad people will have nowhere to escape between heaven and earth, and the bad things they have done can be stopped in a timely manner. As everyone knows, Huang Yifeng, the former Minister of Transportation of the East China Military and Political Committee and concurrently the President of the East China Transportation College, and Wang Zhenhai, the former Secretary of the Dingxian Prefectural Committee of the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee, were both accused and received the punishment they deserved. Zhang Baotong, a Communist Party member of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, accused Wang Zisheng, the secretary of the Party branch of the coking department of the plant, of fabricating achievements, and Han Changxin, a worker of Anshan Iron and Steel Small Rolling Mill, accused Kang Zhaowen, the deputy secretary of the general branch committee of the plant, of stealing his rationalization proposals. Although they all experienced long delays and various twists and turns, they persisted in the struggle and finally won. These facts show that the era of bad people in power and good people suffering is gone forever. Article 41 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "Citizens of The People’s Republic of China have the right to criticize and make suggestions to any state organ or state functionary. Citizens have the right to make to relevant State organs complaints of violation of law or dereliction of duty on the part of any state organ or state functionary, but fabrication or distortion of facts for the purpose of libel or frame-up is prohibited." The resolution of the National Conference of the Communist Party of China on the establishment of the Party's supervisory committee, like this provision of the Constitution, has greatly encouraged the active elements inside and outside the Party who accuse bad people and bad deeds, and it is a warning bell for those bad elements who continue to do evil.
    Some people oppose mass accusations. They sometimes find various fallacies to defend themselves, and more often they use various bad means to attack and frame the accusers, or shelve the accusations, making them practically ineffective. It should be said that anyone who opposes mass accusations is a bad person. If you are not a bad person, why are you afraid of accusations and attacking the accusers? There is a good folk saying: "If you haven't done anything wrong in your life, you won't be startled by someone knocking on your door in the middle of the night." Of course, there may be inaccuracies in mass accusations, and even malicious accusations may occur, but what is there to be afraid of? When the water recedes, the stones will come out, and after investigation, the truth will come to light; people who have not done bad things are not afraid of being misunderstood for a while. Facts show that in past mass accusations, whether inside or outside the Party, there were very few false accusations, but many accusers were attacked. Is this not enough to show that what is urgently needed today is to give support and guarantees to accusers inside and outside the Party, and to give blows and sanctions to those bad elements who attack the accusers?
    The establishment of the Party's supervisory committee means that the Party's discipline needs to be strengthened and will be strengthened. But this does not mean that it has already been strengthened. In order to turn the Party's requirements into living reality, serious struggles are still needed. All staff members of the Party's supervisory committee, who are responsible for supervising the realization of the Party's requirements, must faithfully fulfill their responsibilities, establish a serious and responsible, realistic and truth-seeking work style, strictly abide by the Party Constitution, Party discipline, and state laws and decrees as an example, firmly struggle against bad people and bad deeds, and seriously examine and handle cases, as instructed by the Party's resolution. The work of the Party's discipline inspection committee in the past few years has made significant achievements, but there are also shortcomings and mistakes. The emergence of these shortcomings and mistakes, in addition to the limitations of powers and organization as mentioned above, or due to inappropriate selection of personnel, is also due to the fact that a small number of personnel responsible for discipline inspection work are concerned about personal gains and losses, afraid of offending people, and afraid of being attacked and retaliated against, and therefore cannot firmly and correctly fight against bad people and bad deeds. This should be said to be a dereliction of duty. Of course, there are also individual staff members who have one-sided views, listen to one side and believe it, are self-righteous, and make conclusions lightly without careful investigation and research, so that the Party members concerned are punished too severely, or even punished completely wrongly. This is also not allowed. The staff of the Party's supervisory committee are representatives of the Party and must impartially and realistically examine and handle all violations of laws and discipline within the Party. Only in this way can the Party's discipline be truly strengthened.

### 动员全党全民同坏人坏事作斗争

    动员全党全民同坏人坏事作斗争
    巩固党的纪律，严肃地检查和处理党员违反党的纪律的事件，是一项严重的政治任务。这是无产阶级思想对资产阶级思想和其他非无产阶级思想的斗争，是党的意志统一和行动统一的保证，是党同群众密切联系的保证。列宁说：“谁只要稍微减弱无产阶级党内铁的纪律（特别是在无产阶级专政时期），那他在事实上就是帮助资产阶级来反对无产阶级。”这个原理对于人民民主专政的中华人民共和国也是完全适用的。中国共产党全国代表会议决定成立中央的和地方各级的监察委员会来代替目前的纪律检查委员会，借以加强党的纪律，加强反对党员中各种违法乱纪现象的斗争，特别是防止像高岗、饶漱石反党联盟这一类严重危害党的利益的事件重复发生。这是必要的和适时的。
    党的全国代表会议的决议指出，不论外国帝国主义者或是国内的反革命分子，他们都知道，要进攻中国人民，最厉害的办法莫如首先进攻中国人民和中国工人阶级的领导力量——中国共产党。因此，他们时时刻刻在寻找各种机会向我们党进行公开的和隐蔽的进攻。在这种阶级斗争形势下，党内一部分不坚定的不可靠的分子经不起资产阶级思想的侵蚀，因而违法乱纪，甚至蜕化变质。这类事实虽然有一部分已经被揭发和处理了，但是还有更多的没有被揭发，或者虽然被揭发出来，但还没有得到及时的严肃的处理。继续容忍这种情形只有对党和人民的敌人有利，对于人民民主专政和社会主义事业就只能造成危害。
    为了同这些坏人坏事作彻底的有效的斗争，不但要依靠党和国家机关的一般的政治工作和组织工作的加强，而且要依靠党和国家的专门的监督机关的加强；不但要依靠全党的一切积极分子的共同努力，而且要依靠全国人民中一切积极分子的共同努力。
    党的监察委员会就是党内的一个专门同坏人坏事作斗争的监督机关。按照党的全国代表会议的决议，党的各级监察委员会在各级党委指导下进行工作，它有权检查和处理一切党员违反党章、党纪和国家法律、法令的案件。各级党委委员如有违反党章、党纪和国家法律、法令的行为，应由同级党委处理；但上级党的监察委员会认为必要的时候，有权直接加以处理。党的地方各级监察委员会在对上级党委委员和同级党委委员进行检查的时候，以及对上级和同级党委所管理的干部职务名称表内的干部给以撤销工作以上的处分的时候，应当分别征得上级和同级党委的同意；但地方监察委员会如认为同级党委的决定不适当的时候，有权向上一级党委提出申诉。由此可见，党的监察委员会比原有的党的各级纪律检查委员会拥有更广泛的权力。原有的各级纪律检查委员会完全受同级党委的管理，对下级党委的纪律检查委员会的工作无权直接过问，因此，如果党委重视党的纪律工作，并能以身作则地严格遵守党的纪律，那末，在这个党委所领导下的纪律检查委员会的工作就作得比较好；如果不是这样，那末在这个党委所领导下的纪律检查委员会的工作就很难作好。原中共中央东北局纪律检查委员会就是一个例子。这个纪律检查委员会是在反党分子高岗领导之下，他的追随者张秀山、陈伯村、郭峰又兼任了这个委员会的正副书记，因此，这个纪律检查委员会就不能对高岗的反党活动进行检查，就不能按照党的原则进行工作。同样，原中共中央山东分局代理书记向明不但蛮横地限制分局纪律检查委员会的工作，而且把中央纪律检查委员会派去的工作人员也“赶出山东”。这就可以清楚地看出成立党的监察委员会来代替纪律检查委员会的必要了。
    党的监察委员会在同坏人、坏事作斗争的时候，不应当仅仅依靠少数几个工作人员；少数工作人员哪怕再努力，他们的作用毕竟是有限的。党的监察委员会不但必须善于同国家检察机关和政府监察机关建立密切的合作，而且必须善于发动全体党员和全体爱国公民同坏人坏事斗争的积极性。过去的纪律检查委员会的组织过于狭小，同党内外广大群众缺乏公开的、直接的联系，这也是它的工作受到限制的原因之一。党在成立监察委员会的决议中规定：“一切党员有义务向党的监察委员会报告他所知道的党员违法乱纪的情况，并帮助党的监察委员会同违反党章、党纪和国家法律、法令的党员进行斗争。”决议又规定：“党的中央和地方各级监察委员会必须同各级工会、青年团、妇女联合会、合作社的监事会以及其他群众组织取得经常的联系，并依靠这些组织联系广大群众进行工作。”这些规定对动员党内外广大群众反对坏人坏事的斗争创造了有利的条件。
    为要及时地有效地揭发和打击坏人坏事，必须着重提倡群众的告发。坏分子的头上并没有刻上“坏分子”三个字，他们还会用各种手段来掩盖他们所作的坏事，因此单靠由上而下的检查往往还不能发现或不能完全发现他们的真面目。但是“要得人不知，除非己莫为”，一个人做了坏事总是有人受害的，也总是有人知道的。只要对由下而上的控告加以广泛的提倡，并且认真地保护控告者不受报复，那末坏人就无所逃于天地之间，他们所作的坏事就可以受到及时的制止。大家知道，前华东军政委员会交通部长兼华东交通专科学校校长黄逸峰，前中共河北省定县地委书记王振海，就都是被人告发而受到应得的处分的。太原钢铁厂的共产党员张宝桐控告该厂炼焦部党支部书记王自生伪造成绩，鞍钢小型轧钢厂的工人韩长信控告该厂总支委员会副书记康兆文窃夺他的合理化建议，虽然都经过长期的拖延，受到种种的波折，但是他们坚持斗争，都终于得到胜利。这些事实表明，坏人当道好人遭殃的时代是已经一去不复返了。中华人民共和国宪法第九十七条规定：“中华人民共和国公民对于任何违法失职的国家机关工作人员，有向各级国家机关提出书面控告或者口头控告的权利。由于国家机关工作人员侵犯公民权利而受到损失的人，有取得赔偿的权利。”中国共产党全国代表会议关于成立党的监察委员会的决议，同宪法的这个规定一样，对于告发坏人坏事的党内外积极分子作了极大的鼓励，而对于那些继续为非作歹的坏分子则是警告的洪钟。
    有些人反对群众的控告。他们有时找出种种歪道理来替自己辩护，更多的是用种种恶劣手段来打击陷害控告者，或者对控告加以搁置，使它实际上不能生效。应当说，凡是反对群众控告的人就是坏人。你如果不是坏人，你为什么害怕控告和打击控告者呢？民间有句俗语说得好：平生不作亏心事，半夜敲门也不惊。在群众的告发中当然可能有失实的地方，甚至也可能有挟嫌诬告的事，但是这又有什么可怕呢？水落了石头就要出来，案件经过调查，真相就要大白；没有作过坏事的人是不怕一时被误会的。事实证明，在过去的群众控告中，无论党内外，诬告的极少，倒是控告人受打击的很多。这难道还不足以说明，今天迫切需要的乃是给党内外控告者以支持和保障，给那些打击控告者的坏分子以打击和制裁吗？
    党的监察委员会的成立，意味着党的纪律需要加强和将要加强。但是这还不等于它已经加强了。为了把党的要求变为活生生的实际，还需要进行严重的斗争。对于实现党的要求负有监督责任的党的监察委员会的一切工作人员，如党的决议所指示的，必须忠实地履行自己的职责，树立严肃负责、实事求是的作风，以身作则地严格遵守党章、党纪和国家法律、法令，坚定地对坏人坏事进行斗争，严肃地检查和处理案件。党的纪律检查委员会过去几年的工作有重大的成绩，但是也有缺点和错误。这些缺点和错误的产生，除了像上面所说的由于职权和组织所限，或者由于人选不当以外，还由于少数负责纪律检查工作的人员顾虑个人得失，怕得罪人，怕受到打击报复，因而不能坚定地正确地同坏人坏事作斗争。这应当说是一种失职行为。当然，也有个别工作人员有片面观点，偏听偏信，自以为是，没有经过周密的调查研究，就轻率地作出结论，以至对有关的党员处分得过重，甚至处分得根本错误。这同样是不许可的。党的监察委员会的工作人员是党的代表，必须大公无私地、实事求是地来检查和处理党内的一切违法乱纪案件。只有这样，党的纪律才能真正加强起来。
