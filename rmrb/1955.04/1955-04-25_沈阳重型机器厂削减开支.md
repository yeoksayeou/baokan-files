    Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant Reduces Expenditures
    The Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant reviewed its material procurement plan, reduced unnecessary expenditures, and avoided the backlog of more than one million yuan in funds.

    Recently, the plant reviewed its second quarter material procurement plan, the third and fourth quarter grinding wheel procurement plan, the temporary tool procurement plan for April, and several production management fee expenditure plans. In reviewing the material supply plan, staff members of the Supervision Office conducted in-depth investigations and research in workshops and warehouses, and found that many firebricks planned for procurement in the second quarter could be replaced by long-term stockpiled firebricks; the coal consumption for boilers in spring and summer should be reduced, but the procurement plan was still based on winter consumption; the planned procurement of pig iron for steelmaking was also more than 4,600 tons in excess. After investigation, it was found that among the sixteen kinds of production raw materials, materials, and fuels planned for procurement in the second quarter alone, fourteen were far in excess of actual needs, thus reducing the budget by more than 1.2 million yuan. In addition, according to actual needs, the investment in grinding wheel procurement for the third and fourth quarters was reduced by more than 30,000 yuan. Temporary tool procurement investment and management fee expenditures for April were also reduced by more than 4,000 yuan.

    沈阳重型机器厂削减开支
    沈阳重型机器厂审查物资采购计划，削减不必要的开支，避免了一百多万元资金的积压。
    最近，这个厂审查了第二季度物资采购计划、第三和第四季度砂轮采购计划、四月份工具临时采购计划和数项生产管理费的开支计划。在审查物资供应计划中，监察室的工作人员曾深入车间、仓库，进行调查研究，发现第二季度计划采购的许多耐火砖都能以长期积压的耐火砖代用；春夏两季的锅炉用煤量应该减少，但采购计划仍是按冬季的需用量编制的；计划采购的炼钢生铁也多余了四千六百余吨。经查明，仅是第二季度计划采购的十六种生产原料、材料和燃料中，就有十四种大大超过实际需要，即削减了一百二十余万元。此外，按实际需要，第三、四季度砂轮采购投资削减了三万多元。四月份工具临时采购投资和管理费开支也削减了四千多元。
