Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 17th: Since the 12th, the Chinese Trade Delegation Visiting Japan and the Japanese trade negotiation groups have held group meetings on comprehensive issues, import and export issues, payment issues, and shipping issues.

After consultation and discussion, the two sides reached agreement on the protocol lists of A, B, and C category commodities, the proportion of various types of goods, and the mutual holding of commodity exhibitions at the group meetings on the 14th and 15th.

Regarding shipping issues, the Chinese delegation has expressed agreement with the operational requirements put forward by the Japanese side. Regarding administrative management issues, the Chinese delegation believes that issues that need to be considered by the government need to depend on the results of the trade negotiations and will be discussed further if necessary.

Regarding payment issues, the Chinese delegation suggested that the national banks of the two countries conclude a payment agreement, with each settling foreign exchange in its own currency, to facilitate the smooth development of trade between the two countries. The Japanese representatives argued that this could not be resolved until diplomatic relations between the two countries were restored, and suggested that the Bank of Tokyo and the Bank of China sign a payment agreement. However, the Japanese representatives later stated that it could not include any embargoed goods and must also obtain approval from the U.S. government, thereby overturning the originally proposed plan. This statement by the Japanese side means that the payment issue has not yet been resolved.

Regarding the issue of establishing permanent trade representative offices in each other's countries, the Chinese delegation has repeatedly pointed out that this organization must be powerful, effective, and able to practically solve various issues related to trade between the two countries. After many consultations, the Japanese representatives have not yet expressed a clear affirmative opinion.

The group meetings between the two sides will continue.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 15th: Lei Renmin, head of the Chinese Trade Delegation Visiting Japan, and five others attended a luncheon hosted by Kuhara Fusanosuke, president of the National Council for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations, at 12:00 noon on the 15th.

The Japanese attendees included: Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry Tanzan Ishibashi, Secretary-General of the Japanese Democratic Party Nobusuke Kishi, Secretary-General of the Liberal Party Mitsujiro Ishii, President of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association Shozo Murata, Manager of Fuji Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. Tomoji Kato, Manager of Hakodate Dock Co., Ltd. Hisaro Kano, Manager of Nichiro Fisheries Co., Ltd. Koichiro Kobayashi, Vice President of the Greater Japan Fisheries Association Iwao Fujita, Manager of Nippon Reizo Co., Ltd. Koijiro Kimura, Manager of Kyokuyo Whaling Co., Ltd.

    中日双方连日就贸易问题举行分组会议
    恢复日中日苏邦交国民会议会长招待我贸易代表团
    新华社东京十七日电　从十二日以来，中国访问日本贸易代表团和日本方面的贸易谈判团体按综合、进出口、支付和海运问题，连日举行了分组会议。
    经过协商和讨论，有关甲乙丙商品分类的协议货单和各类货物比例及双方相互举行商品展览会问题，双方已在十四日和十五日的分组会议上取得一致意见。
    关于海运问题，中国代表团对日方提出的属于业务方面的要求，已表示同意；有关行政管理方面的问题，中国代表团认为需要由政府考虑的问题，须要看贸易谈判的结果，如有需要再行商谈。
    关于支付问题，中国代表团建议由两国的国家银行缔结支付协定，各以本国货币结汇，以利于两国贸易的顺利发展。日方代表以两国邦交未恢复前不可能解决为理由，建议由东京银行和中国银行签定支付协定。但后来日方代表又说不能包括有任何禁运物资，还必须获得美国政府的批准，借此推翻了原来提出的方案。日方这一表示，使支付问题到目前还没有解决。
    关于互设常驻贸易机构的问题，中国代表团多次指出这一机构必须是有权力的、有效能的，能在实际上解决有关两国贸易的各项问题。经过多次协商，日方代表还没有表示明确的肯定的意见。
    双方的分组会议将继续进行。
    新华社东京十五日电　中国访问日本贸易代表团团长雷任民等六人，在十五日中午十二时应邀出席了恢复日中、日苏邦交国民会议会长久原房之助举行的午餐会。
