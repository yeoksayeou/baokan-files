Key Project on Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Between Shandan and Zhangye Soon to Start Construction

    The key project on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway between Shandan and Zhangye is about to begin construction. The Shandan to Zhangye section is mostly in an area of efflorescent soil, crossing many lake beaches. The Third Engineering Section, responsible for the construction, conducted a construction survey in February. Originally, it was thought there was no riprap available along the line, and the required riprap was planned to be transported from east of Shandan. However, with the assistance of farmers during the survey, a large number of sand and gravel production sites were found near the line. During the survey, engineers Yong Guilong and Wu Xianzhu discovered that changing the route originally planned to pass near Yaozi Lake to pass along the south side of the lake could avoid the construction difficulties of the large efflorescent soil area of Yaozi Lake and improve the quality of the line. This suggestion could save the state more than 300,000 yuan.
    The survey team responsible for the preliminary survey of the Yumen to Hami section departed on the 8th to begin preliminary surveys. The First Survey and Design Team of the Northwest Design Bureau conducted political, economic, cultural, and geological surveys along this section in October 1954, collected necessary data, and performed paper alignment based on maps. This preliminary survey will be conducted simultaneously along the south, middle, and north lines. (Our correspondent in Lanzhou)

    兰新铁路山丹张掖间重点工程即将施工
    兰新铁路山丹、张掖间重点工程即将施工。山丹至张掖段沿线多是泛浆地带，跨过多处湖滩。担任施工任务的第三工程段曾在二月份进行了施工调查，在砂石方面原认为沿线无片石可采，所需片石计划由山丹以东装运，但在调查中经农民协助，在沿线附近找到大量砂石产地。调查中工程师勇桂龙、吴显祖发现原走腰子湖一带线路改由湖南边通过，可避免腰子湖大泛浆区施工困难，提高线路质量，这一建议可给国家节约三十多万元。
    担任玉门至哈密段草测任务的勘测队已在八日出发开始草测。西北设计分局第一勘测设计总队一九五四年十月间曾派人在这段沿线进行了政治、经济、人文和地质调查，搜集了必要资料，根据地图进行了纸上定线。这次草测将分南、中、北三线同时进行。（本报驻兰州记者）
