A Mine Seriously Wasting Resources
    Fang Ling
    The Tangshan Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine is a mine with complex geological conditions and multiple coal seams. To exploit such a mine, the geological situation should be clarified first, but Tangshan Mine has not done this work for a long time. Tangshan Mine has long pursued output by means of random excavation and mining, which has seriously wasted national resources. Due to non-standard roadways, there are many difficulties in the recovery work. The recovery rate of some coal seams is only 40% to 50%. In the past year, Tangshan Mine abandoned more than 20,000 tons of coal simply because it was not mined when it should have been. There were a total of 6,624 mechanical and electrical and gas accidents, affecting production for 2,793 hours and reducing coal production by more than 100,000 tons. Among them, there were 11 major accidents and 13 major roof collapse accidents.
    Judging from the production chart of Tangshan Mine, before September last year, the red line went uphill, and the task was overfulfilled every month. But after uncovering the inside story, it turned out that this "achievement" was achieved by having workers work overtime to rush production through means of random mining, random excavation, random blasting, and random digging.
    This kind of behavior that seriously damages underground resources began in Tangshan Mine as early as the fourth quarter of 1953. Mine Director Rong Yimin openly, and even at party meetings, said: "If you want to complete the task, you have to destroy the technical policy." Under the guidance of this leadership thought, in May of last year, in order to pursue output, without clarifying the geological situation, the 9601 coal seam near the 9603 coal seam was mined by means of simultaneous excavation and mining. When it was discovered that the geological situation was not right and the output was getting smaller and smaller, the mining of 9603 coal seam should have been arranged reasonably, but in order to rush the task, Tangshan Mine dug more than 1,000 tons from the easy-to-mine end of 9603 coal seam without design. Although the monthly production plan was completed, it left about 6,000 tons of coal in 9603 coal seam isolated and unable to be safely mined. In early December, the Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration instructed to find a way to mine this coal, but Tangshan Mine not only did not implement this instruction, but also started random digging in the lower 9807 coal seam of 9603 coal seam, putting 9603 coal seam in a desperate situation, and 6,000 tons of coal were discarded underground. When mining 9807 coal seam, no preparations were made, and with the great pressure from 9603 coal seam, 9807 coal seam changed its pillars three times, which not only violated the mining procedures, seriously threatened the safety of workers, but also wasted a large number of pit props. At that time, workers and the technical supervision team of Tangshan Mine raised their opinions, but Rong Yimin said: "Deal with it for a few days to complete the task!"
    In order to rush production, Tangshan Mine disregarded the safety and health of workers. The workers reflected that Tangshan Mine has "three treasures" to complete the task: first, party, government, labor union, and youth league cadres go down the well to supervise the battle, "call to pull up the coal when you see it"; second, occupy the night shift repair and preparation work time of the coal seam face to rush production; third, let the workers give up weekend shifts and work overtime, euphemistically called "borrowing shifts." In a word, it is brute force! In August last year, Tangshan Mine did not complete the plan in the first or middle ten days of the month. On the 29th, it still owed more than 3,500 tons of coal. According to the daily production capacity, it was impossible to complete the monthly plan. So the "three treasures" were used: tunneling workers blindly pursued footage regardless of the geological situation; coal mining workers fired and collapsed coal closely behind the tunneling workers without waiting for the tunneling workers to open the coal seam face; the night shift repair time was also occupied. As a result of such brute force, the deficit was made up in two days and one night. However, due to excessive tension and fatigue of the workers, the site was damaged by random excavation and mining, and tunneling, mining, transportation, and repair were all out of sync, which caused serious difficulties for the next stage of production. On September 1, the output only completed half of the plan, and the coal production was more than 5,000 tons less than on August 31. By the end of September, it had to mobilize all the staff again to rush production. This dragged on until October, the workers were also tired, and there were more accidents. As a result, the task was not completed for two consecutive months in October and November.
    Due to the long-term neglect of production preparation work, random mining and excavation, the production situation is deteriorating. In January of this year, on the surface, it seems that 25% of the spare coal seams have been opened. In fact, these spare coal seams are all randomly excavated, some without air eyes, some without coal discharge eyes, and none can be used without major repairs. One-half of the roadways in the mine do not meet the standards, the transportation roads are rugged and uneven, and electric chutes cannot be laid. This seriously threatens the production plan for the first quarter of this year. The production plan for January was arranged eight times, and the preparation work was very chaotic. Many coal seams could not be put into recovery on time. The original mining method for 9875 coal seam was determined according to the coal thickness of three meters. When the electric chute was laid and recovery began, it was discovered that the coal thickness was eight meters. As a result of this back and forth, no daily work plan was completed, and the entire mine only completed 75.32% of the national plan in January. The task was not completed in February either. In the past two months, more than 50,000 tons of coal have been lost again.
    The caving mining method is the method used by imperialists to plunder our country's underground resources. Tangshan Mine's use of this method to manage production is a serious mistake. Facts have proved that this method has not only failed to enable Tangshan Mine to complete its production plan, but has also seriously wasted national resources, causing the enterprise's production to be in a state of chaos for a long time.
    The Kailuan Coal Mine Party Committee and the Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration have repeatedly instructed Tangshan Mine to strengthen production preparation work, but they have not conducted in-depth inspections and supervision afterward. The Tangshan Municipal Party Committee's working group stationed in the mine and the Tangshan Mine's technical supervision team have repeatedly reported to the Kailuan Coal Mine Party Committee and the Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration that Tangshan Mine has failed to implement the instructions of higher authorities and violated national technical policies, but they have not immediately taken active measures to seriously deal with these problems. The Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration also pointed out that some coal seams can be completely non-caving, such as 8952 coal seam, with a coal thickness of five or six meters, which can be mined using the "wattle false roof horizontal layered coal mining method." However, Tangshan Mine refused to implement this suggestion under the pretext of not having wattle. After assisting them in buying wattle, Tangshan Mine delayed again on various excuses. Later, an investigation revealed that 8952 coal seam had already been destroyed by the caving mining method. The Kailuan Coal Mine Party Committee and the Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration did not seriously deal with this mistake of deceiving the leadership. This laissez-faire attitude further fueled the development of Tangshan Mine's mistakes.
    Now is the time to strictly stop Tangshan Mine's erroneous behavior of wasting resources and disregarding safety.

    一个严重浪费资源的矿山
    方凌
    开滦煤矿唐山矿是一个地质复杂，多煤层的矿山。开采这样的矿山，应该首先搞清地质情况，但唐山矿长期没做好这项工作。唐山矿长期用乱掘、乱采的手段追求产量，严重浪费了国家的资源，由于巷道不合规格，回采工作有不少困难。有些礃子的煤的回采率只有百分之四十到五十。过去的一年中，唐山矿仅因该采不采而丢弃的煤，就在两万吨以上。机电和瓦斯等事故共达六千六百二十四次，影响生产二千七百九十三小时，少产煤十万多吨。其中仅重大事故就有十一起，重大冒顶事故十三次。
    从唐山矿的生产指示图表上看来，去年九月以前，红线顺坡而上，月月超额完成任务。但扯开内幕之后，原来这个“成绩”是用乱采、乱掘、乱崩、乱挖的手段让工人加班加点突击来的。
    这种严重破坏地下资源的行为，唐山矿早在一九五三年第四季度就开始发生了。矿长荣毅民公开地、甚至在党的会议上也说：“要完成任务么，就得破坏点技术政策。”在这种领导思想的指导下，去年五月份，为了追产量，不等搞清地质情况，就用边掘边采的办法开采了九六零三礃附近的九六零一礃。当发现地质情况不对头，产量越来越少时，本应合理布置九六零三礃的开采，但唐山矿为了赶任务，又在没有设计的情况下，从九六零三礃好采的一端挖去了一千多吨。虽然完成了月产计划，但却使九六零三礃约六千吨煤陷于孤立，无法安全采出。到了十二月初，开滦煤矿总管理处指示要设法将这块煤采出，唐山矿不但没有执行这一指示，反而又在九六零三礃的下层九八零七礃开始乱挖，使九六零三礃处于绝境，六千吨煤被丢弃在地下。在开采九八零七礃时，同样也没有做好准备，加上九六零三礃压力很大，九八零七礃连换了三次支柱，不仅违反了开采程序，严重地威胁着工人的安全，还浪费了大批坑木。当时，工人和唐山矿技术监察组都曾提出意见，但荣毅民却说：“对付几天完成任务再说吧！”
    为了突击产量，唐山矿不顾工人的安全和健康。工人们反映：唐山矿完成任务有“三宝”：一是党、政、工、团干部下井值班督战，“见煤就叫拉上来”；二是占用夜班检修和礃子面的准备工作时间，突击生产；三是让工人放弃周末轮休，加班加点，美其名曰“借轮休”。一句话就是：蛮干！去年八月份，唐山矿上旬、中旬都没有完成计划，到二十九日，还欠三千五百多吨煤，按照日产能力是不能完成月计划的。于是用出了“三宝”：掘进工不管地质情况，盲目追求进尺；采煤工不等掘进工开好礃子面，就紧跟在后面放炮崩煤；夜班检修时间也被占用了。这样蛮干的结果，竟在两天一夜里补足了亏欠。但工人由于过份紧张疲乏，现场遭受乱掘乱采的破坏，掘、采、运输、检修都互相脱节，给下一阶段的生产，造成了严重困难。九月一日，产量只完成计划的一半，比八月三十一日少产五千多吨煤；到了九月底，只得再全体动员，突击生产。这样拖到十月份，工人也疲倦了，事故也多起来了，结果十月、十一月连续两个月没有完成任务。
    由于长期忽视生产准备工作，乱采乱掘，生产局面日趋恶化。今年一月份，从表面上看好像也已开好百分之二十五的备用礃子了。实际上这些备用礃子都是乱掘出来的，有的没有风眼，有的没有放煤眼，不经过大修，没一个能用的。全矿二分之一的巷道不合规格，运输道崎岖不平，电溜子无法铺设。这就使今年第一季度生产计划受到严重的威胁。一月份的生产计划排了八次，准备工作十分混乱，许多礃子不能按时投入回采。九八七五礃原来是按煤厚三公尺决定的开采方法，等到铺好电溜子开始回采时，才发现煤厚为八公尺，这样反来复去的结果，没有一天完成作业计划，全矿一月份只完成国家计划的百分之七十五点三二。二月份照样没有完成任务。两个月来，又亏欠了五万多吨煤。
    落垛式的采矿方法是帝国主义掠夺我国地下资源的方法，唐山矿沿用这种方法来管理生产是一个严重的错误，事实证明，这种方法不仅没有能使唐山矿完成生产计划，而且严重浪费了国家的资源，使企业生产长期陷在混乱状态中。
    中共开滦煤矿党委和开滦煤矿总管理处，虽曾多次指示唐山矿应加强生产准备工作，但事后并没有进行深入的检查和督促。中共唐山市委下矿工作组和唐山矿技术监察组，曾屡次将唐山矿不执行上级指示和违反国家技术政策等情况，向中共开滦煤矿党委和开滦煤矿总管理处反映过，但他们没有立即采取积极措施严肃地处理这些问题。开滦煤矿总管理处也曾指出有些礃子完全可以不落垛，如八九五二礃，煤厚五、六公尺，完全可用“荆笆伪顶水平分层采煤法”开采。但唐山矿借口没有荆笆拒绝执行这个建议，等协助他们买来荆笆后，唐山矿又借故拖延，后来一调查，原来八九五二礃早就被落垛式采煤法破坏了。中共开滦煤矿党委会和开滦煤矿总管理处却没有严肃处理这种欺瞒领导的错误。这种放任自流的态度，更助长了唐山矿错误的发展。
    现在应该是严格制止唐山矿这种浪费资源和不顾安全的错误行为的时候了。
