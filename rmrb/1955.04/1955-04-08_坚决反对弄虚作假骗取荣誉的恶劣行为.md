    Resolutely Oppose the Bad Behavior of Obtaining Honors Through Deceit and Fraud
    Song Zheng
    Respect for labor is a characteristic of the working class party. Therefore, our Party has always attached importance to cultivating and rewarding labor models, and giving those model figures who love labor and have made major inventions and creations in labor lofty honors. Moreover, through the commendation and reward of labor models, we educate the broad masses of the people, so that everyone regards labor as a supremely glorious, heroic, and bold undertaking, and encourages everyone to carry forward the spirit of hard work and bold creation in labor, in order to continuously improve our labor productivity and accelerate our country's socialist construction. Love of labor is the foundation of all the noble moral qualities of our working class and Communists. In recent years, the large number of labor models and advanced producers cultivated and educated by our Party have not only possessed a spirit of hard work and bold creation in production, but also have boundless enthusiasm and a sense of responsibility for the country's socialist construction. They work well and work hard, first and foremost for the progress and victory of the collective cause, and for the interests and happiness of the broad masses of the people. Therefore, they are not only good laborers, but also good collectivists, models produced with the help and support of the collective, and at the same time, they lead the collective to advance together and improve together, becoming the backbone and core figures among the masses. The great achievements our country has made in economic construction in recent years are inseparable from their outstanding contributions. Therefore, it is very necessary for the state and the people to give labor models lofty honors.
    However, there are also some people within our Party who mistakenly treat honor and the Party's policy of rewarding models with the bourgeois exploitation ideology of seeking gains without labor through speculation and trickery. Kang Zhaowen of the small steel rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company abused his position as deputy secretary of the Party's general branch to steal the inventions and creations of worker Han Changxin, and retaliated against Han Changxin. This is the most prominent event of using exploitative behavior to obtain honor through deception. Of course, such theft of other people's labor achievements like Kang Zhaowen is only a very individual phenomenon within our Party. However, in order to gain personal reputation and status, the phenomenon of using illegitimate means such as speculation, exaggeration, and fabrication to falsely report achievements and obtain honor through deception is quite common at present. Some people, in order to make the units they lead stand out, do not hesitate to fabricate or exaggerate facts out of thin air, and create fake labor models. Some people, in order to show the achievements of their units, disregard the interests of the state and the people, and adopt various evil means of harming the public to benefit themselves and harming others to benefit themselves. For example, some factories and mines, in order to "overfulfill the task" and to deceive the leading organs for commendation and reward, use various capitalist means such as overestimating costs, working overtime, and disregarding safety and quality to deceive the state, deceive brother factories and mines, and the broad consumers. There are also many leaders who, in order to show their achievements, are infected with varying degrees of exaggeration. When summarizing their work, they are afraid that their achievements will not be significant or prominent enough, so they often exaggerate some immature and piecemeal experiences into mature and systematic experiences; when talking about shortcomings, they gloss over them. As a result, some people have not done their job well, but spread their experiences and brag about themselves everywhere, and as a result, they also deceived the leading organs for commendation and reward. There are also some comrades who have indeed obtained the glorious title of model through their hard and creative labor. However, they have since been blinded by honor and are no longer willing to work diligently. In order to maintain their acquired honor, they use deception and exaggeration to fabricate some facts, so that they slowly transform from true models into fake models.
    Whether it is to usurp other people's labor achievements, fabricate facts and exaggerate achievements, or use methods of harming others to benefit oneself to show one's achievements, the ideological essence is the same, that is, the exploitative ideology of only envying honor but not loving labor is at work. They have forgotten that love of labor and hatred of exploitation are the most fundamental and basic distinctions between the working class Communists and the exploiting classes. Once a Communist Party member is infected with this exploitative ideology of speculation and seeking gains without labor, if they do not become vigilant and correct themselves immediately, they will lose resistance to various bourgeois ideologies, and even embark on the road of opposing the Party. In order to protect this illegitimate honor, they will shamelessly buy off this one and win over that one, and find some people with wavering standpoints as their accomplices in doing evil. If someone dares to expose their mistakes and fight against them, they will retaliate against the whistleblower, and even fabricate charges to plot against them. At the same time, in order to prevent their mistakes from being exposed, they must also come up with many ways to restrict democratic life inside and outside the Party, suppress criticism and self-criticism from the bottom up, and make Party life fall into an extremely abnormal state. They not only suppress democracy from below, but also resist inspection from above, and try to cut off the connection between the leading organs and the masses, and conceal the true situation of the work from the leading organs. As a result of this deception from above and suppression from below, the work of these units loses the support and supervision of the leading organs and the masses, and various serious shortcomings and errors inevitably occur. Wang Zisheng, the former branch secretary of the coking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant (his mistakes are in the People's Daily on March 4) and Kang Zhaowen of Anshan Small Steel Rolling Mill have taken this path of opposing the Party.
    What should be particularly alarming is that this evil phenomenon of obtaining honor through deception and fraud has occurred in many areas, and these problems often cannot be exposed and dealt with very quickly and smoothly, which shows that the foundation of our Party's work is still very weak in some places. The general branch committee of the small factory is like this. Some of the general branch committee members were bought off and won over by Kang Zhaowen, becoming his accomplices in carrying out anti-Party activities; some, under the control of sectarian emotions, blindly believed that Kang Zhaowen would not do bad things; and some were worried about personal gains and losses and could not persist in the struggle to the end. Moreover, in the entire Party organization, in twenty months, no one dared to stand up and uphold the truth. These problems cannot be exposed and dealt with quickly, also because some leading cadres of the leading organs have been infected with the disease of bureaucracy.
    Many leading cadres of Party leading organs have correctly implemented the Party's policy of rewarding models. They supervise the units under their jurisdiction, cultivate and reward models according to correct standards, and at the same time pay attention to inspecting and helping the work of advanced units, pay attention to educating model figures to prevent pride and complacency and detachment from the masses; specifically help model units and labor models solve problems in their work, so that they can continuously improve their work and strive for greater achievements, and pay attention to using these advanced experiences to educate everyone and promote work. However, there are also some leading cadres of Party leading organs who have a wrong understanding of the Party's policy of rewarding models. They commend and reward models, often only in order to make the departments or regions they lead gain honor and be valued. Therefore, they often treat these things with a bureaucratic attitude.
    Some leading cadres of leading organs do not consider whether these models are true or false when they commend and reward models. In their view, the more models, the better anyway. Therefore, they only sit in the office to read materials and listen to reports, and do not do in-depth investigations and research at all when commending and rewarding labor models or model units. As a result, those bad elements who obtain honor through deception and fraud can deceive them. There are also some leading cadres of leading organs who, when they hear that a better experience has emerged in the units under their leadership, or that a certain worker technician has made some important inventions and creations, they do attach great importance to it, and immediately send people down to understand the situation, give encouragement, and help prepare various favorable conditions, so that the invention and creation can be completed smoothly, and help summarize the experience. But when these units or individuals have become models and created honor for the region or department, they feel that their historical task seems to have been completed. From then on, they no longer seem to be interested in this advanced unit and model figure. How the achievements of these models are consolidated, how the experience is developed and improved, and what deviations and problems there are in their work, can no longer attract the attention of the leading organs. These leading cadres of the leading organs also have such a strange attitude towards the models they have commended: they neither care about the work of these units, nor are willing for others to criticize the shortcomings of these units, as if these glorious titles are like bank deposits, and will always be their own property. When they hear others reflecting the problems of model units, or exposing the evil behavior of certain model units in obtaining honor through deception and fraud, they do not immediately go deep down to conduct practical investigation and research, and if it is true, they try to help correct the shortcomings, and promptly deal with those bad elements who falsely report achievements; instead, they accuse the people who make suggestions, saying that this is "bad elements making trouble" and "deliberately attacking models", and ask others to "examine their views on model factories", and even suppress and attack critics. In their view, advanced units and model figures will not have shortcomings, and model units can only be praised and not exposed, they think that only in this way can they "protect" the "banner" and advanced units. At the same time, they do not believe that the labor models or model units they have commended and rewarded will have false phenomena. Therefore, they unconsciously become the "protectors" of those fake models.
    Some leading cadres of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China are like this. After Zhang Mingshan of the small steel rolling mill created the anti-encirclement plate, "Kang Zhaowen created the southern steel turning machine", and the various inventions and creations of workers to improve old equipment appeared one after another, the responsible comrades of the Municipal Party Committee personally went to the factory to talk to the worker leaders and help summarize the experience, and gave them a grand commendation and reward. From then on, the small steel rolling mill became famous throughout the country, and the Anshan Municipal Party Committee in fact rarely cared about their work, and the leading cadres of the Municipal Party Committee rarely went to the small factory. After 1953, all parts of the country were learning from the experience of the small steel rolling mill, but the mechanization and automation movement of the small steel rolling mill was silent, and even for a period of time, the production plan could not be completed. However, this abnormal phenomenon did not arouse the vigilance of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee. Under this situation, for nearly two years, the Anshan Municipal Party Committee never conducted a practical and in-depth inspection of the work of the small steel rolling mill, especially the situation of rationalization proposals. How should this phenomenon be explained? If the Anshan Municipal Party Committee did not treat this advanced unit with this bureaucratic attitude, if they could conduct some specific leadership over the advanced unit, and could listen to the voices of the employees of the small factory, without Han Changxin complaining everywhere, Kang Zhaowen's matter could also be discovered and dealt with in time.
    However, no matter how cunning and shameless the anti-Party elements like Kang Zhaowen are in their means of deception and framing, and no matter how the leading organs like the Anshan Municipal Party Committee are infected with the disease of bureaucracy, from the Han Changxin incident, we can once again be sure that the evil behavior of this anti-Party element will eventually be exposed, and they will eventually be severely punished by the Party; those leading organs and leading cadres who are infected with bureaucratic style will eventually learn lessons from these facts and correct their shortcomings. In our Party, there is no room for anything vile and despicable in the long run!

    坚决反对弄虚作假骗取荣誉的恶劣行为
    宋琤
    尊重劳动是工人阶级政党的特点。因此，我们党一向重视培养和奖励劳动模范，给那些热爱劳动、在劳动中有重大发明创造的模范人物以崇高的荣誉。而且通过对劳动模范的表扬、奖励，来教育广大的人民群众，使大家把劳动当做无上光荣、英勇和豪迈的事业，鼓励大家在劳动中发扬刻苦钻研和大胆创造的精神，以便不断地提高我们的劳动生产率，加速我国社会主义建设事业。热爱劳动是我们工人阶级、是共产党员的一切高尚的道德品质的基础。几年来，我们党所培养教育出来的大批的劳动模范和先进生产者，就都是不仅在生产中具有刻苦钻研和大胆创造的精神，而且对于国家的社会主义建设事业具有无限热情和责任感。他们劳动得好、劳动得多，首先是为了集体事业的前进和胜利，为了广大人民群众的利益和幸福。因此，他们就不仅是好的劳动者，而且是好的集体主义者，是在集体的帮助和支持下产生的模范，同时又带动集体共同前进共同提高，成为群众中的骨干和核心人物。几年来我们国家在经济建设中所获得的伟大成就，是和他们的卓越贡献分不开的。因而国家和人民给劳动模范以崇高的荣誉，是十分必要的。
    但是，在我们党内也有一部分人，错误地用资产阶级不劳而获投机取巧的剥削思想来对待荣誉、对待党的奖励模范的政策。鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂康兆文假借党的总支副书记的职权去窃夺工人韩长信的发明创造，并对韩长信施行打击报复，就是这种用剥削行为去骗取荣誉的最突出的事件。当然，像康兆文这样去窃夺别人的劳动成果的，在我们党内只是极个别的现象。但是，为了个人的名誉地位，而用投机取巧、夸大捏造等不正当手段去假报成绩骗取荣誉的，在目前却是相当普遍的现象。有些人为了要使自己所领导的单位能够出风头，不惜凭空捏造或夸大事实，制造假劳动模范。有些人为了要表现本单位的成绩，竟不顾国家和人民的利益，而采用种种损公利私、损人利己的恶劣手段，比如，有些厂矿为了要“超额完成任务”，为了骗取领导机关的表扬奖励，就用各种高估成本、加班加点以及不顾安全、不顾质量等资本主义手段去欺骗国家，欺骗兄弟厂矿和广大的消费者。还有不少领导者，为了显示自己的成绩，沾染了程度不同的虚夸作风，在总结工作时，谈到成绩就唯恐其不显著、不突出，因此常把一些不成熟的点滴的经验，夸大成为成熟的系统的经验；谈到缺点时，则轻描淡写一笔带过。结果就出现这样一些情况：有些人工作并没有作好，却到处传播经验吹嘘自己，结果也骗到了领导机关的表扬和奖励。也还有一些同志，他们确实曾经用自己的艰苦的创造性的劳动取得了模范的光荣称号。但是，他们从此就被荣誉冲昏了头脑，再也不愿勤勤恳恳地努力工作，为了保持既得的荣誉，他们就去采用欺骗和夸大的办法去捏造一些事实，以至于使自己慢慢地由真模范变成了假模范。
    不管是去篡夺别人的劳动成果，不管是捏造事实夸大成绩，或者是用损人利己的办法去表现自己的成绩，其思想本质都是一致的，那就是只羡慕荣誉而不热爱劳动的剥削思想在作怪。他们已经忘记了热爱劳动和痛恨剥削，是工人阶级共产党员同剥削阶级间的最根本的也是最起码的区别。一个共产党员一经沾染上这种投机取巧不劳而获的剥削思想，他们如果不警惕起来立即改正，就会对各种资产阶级思想失掉抵抗，甚至走上反党的道路。为了保护这不正当的荣誉，他们就会无耻地去收买这个拉拢那个，找出一些立场不坚定的人作为他们为非作歹的帮手。如果有人敢于揭发他们的错误和他们进行斗争，他们就会对揭发者施行打击报复，甚至捏造罪名图谋陷害。同时，为了使自己的错误不被揭发，他们还一定要想出许多办法去限制党内外的民主生活，压制自下而上的批评和自我批评，使党内生活陷于极不正常的状态。他们不但对下压制民主，对上还要抗拒检查，尽量设法隔断领导机关和群众的联系，向领导机关隐瞒工作的真实情况。这样欺上压下的结果，就使得这些单位的工作失掉了领导机关和群众的支持和监督，而不可避免地发生各种严重的缺点和错误。太原钢铁厂炼焦部前支部书记王自生（他的错误见三月四日人民日报）和鞍山小型轧钢厂的康兆文就都是这样走上反党的道路的。
    还应该特别引起警惕的是，这种弄虚作假骗取荣誉的恶劣现象在好些地区都发生过，而且这些问题又常常不能很迅速很顺利地被揭发出来加以处理，这说明我们党的工作的基础在有些地方还十分薄弱。小型厂的总支委员会就是这样。总支委员中有的被康兆文收买拉拢，成为他进行反党活动的帮手；有的在宗派情绪支配下，盲目相信康兆文不会做坏事；有的顾虑个人得失不能把斗争坚持到底。而且在整个党组织中，二十个月中，没有一个人敢于挺身而出坚持真理。这些问题不能迅速地被揭发处理，还因为领导机关的某些领导干部染上了官僚主义的毛病。
    许多党的领导机关的领导干部正确地执行了党的奖励模范的政策。他们监督所属的单位，根据正确的标准，认真地培养和奖励模范，同时注意检查和帮助先进单位的工作，注意教育模范人物防止骄傲自满脱离群众；具体帮助模范单位和劳动模范解决工作中的问题，使他们能够不断改进工作争取更大的成绩，并注意运用这些先进经验去教育大家推动工作。但是也有一部分党的领导机关的某些领导干部对于党的奖励模范政策有着错误的理解，他们表扬和奖励模范，常常只是为了使自己所领导的部门或地区因此得到荣誉被人重视。因此，他们就常常用官僚主义的态度来对待这些事情。
    有些领导机关的领导干部，他们在表扬和奖励模范时，根本不考虑这些模范是真是假。在他们看来，反正模范总是越多越好的。因此，他们就只坐在办公室里看材料、听汇报，在表扬和奖励劳动模范或模范单位时根本不做深入的调查研究。以致那些弄虚作假骗取荣誉的坏分子得以从他们那里混蒙过去。还有一些领导机关的领导干部，当他们听说自己领导下的单位出现了较好的经验，或者某个工人技术人员有了一些重要的发明创造时，他们确实是很重视的，立即派人下去了解情况，给予鼓励，帮助准备各种有利的条件，便于这个发明创造能够顺利地完成，并帮助总结经验。但是等到这些单位或个人已经成了模范，为这个地区或部门创造了荣誉，他们就觉得自己的历史任务好像已经完成了。从此，他们对这个先进单位和模范人物好像也就不再感到兴趣了。这些模范的成绩怎样巩固，经验怎样发展、提高，他们的工作中有什么偏差和问题，都不再能够引起领导机关的注意了。这些领导机关的某些领导干部对自己表扬过的模范还有这么一种奇异的态度：他们既不关心这些单位的工作，又不愿别人批评这些单位的缺点，似乎这些光荣的称号像银行存款一样，就永远是他们自己的一笔财产。他们听到别人反映模范单位的问题，或者揭发了某些模范单位弄虚作假的恶劣行为时，不是立即深入下去进行切实的调查研究，如果属实，就设法帮助纠正缺点，并及时处理那些假报成绩的恶劣分子；而是指责提意见的人，说这是“坏分子作怪”、“有意打击模范”，要别人“检查对模范厂的看法”，甚至压制、打击批评者。在他们看来，先进单位和模范人物是不会有缺点的，对于模范单位是只能歌功颂德而不能揭发缺点的，他们以为只有这样才可以
  “保护”了“旗帜”和先进单位。同时，他们也不相信自己所表扬奖励的劳动模范或模范单位还会有虚假现象。因此，他们就不自觉地成了那些假模范的
  “保护者”。
    中共鞍山市委的某些领导干部就是这样。当小型轧钢厂的张明山创造了反围盘、“康兆文创造了南部翻钢机”，以及职工群众的各种改进旧设备的发明创造先后出现后，市委的负责同志亲自到厂里去找工人领导干部谈话，帮助总结经验，对他们进行了隆重的表扬和奖励。从此，小型轧钢厂就闻名全国，而鞍山市委在事实上就很少关心他们的工作了，市委的领导干部也很少到小型厂去了。一九五三年后全国各地都在学习小型轧钢厂的经验，而小型轧钢厂的机械化自动化运动却无声无息了，甚至有一个时期连生产计划都不能完成。但是，这种不正常的现象竟然丝毫也没有引起鞍山市委的警惕。在这种情况下，在将近两年的时间中，鞍山市委始终没有对小型轧钢厂的工作特别是合理化建议的情况进行过一次切实深入的检查，这种现象应该怎样解释呢？如果鞍山市委不是用这种官僚主义态度来对待这个先进单位，如果他们能够对先进单位进行一些具体领导，能够倾听一下小型厂职工群众的呼声，用不着韩长信到处控告，康兆文的事情也就可以及时被发现处理了。
    但是，不管康兆文这一类反党分子欺骗陷害的手段多么狡猾无耻，不管像鞍山市委这样的领导机关如何染上了官僚主义的毛病，从韩长信的事件我们可以再一次地确信，这种反党分子的恶劣行为终于会被揭发出来，他们也终于要受到党的严厉处罚；那些沾染了官僚主义作风的领导机关和领导干部，也终于会从这些事实中吸取教训，纠正缺点。在我们党内，一切卑鄙可耻的东西终久是没有存在的余地的！
