Zhejiang Province Begins Streamlining Institutions and Reducing Staffing

(Our Dispatch from Hangzhou, April 24) The Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee established the Provincial Staffing Committee on April 11.

On April 19, the Zhejiang Provincial Staffing Committee convened a meeting of responsible persons from provincial-level organs to discuss the streamlining of institutions and the reduction of staffing. Zeng Shaodong, Deputy Secretary-General of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee, reported on the Zhejiang Province's work plan for streamlining institutions and reducing staffing in 1955. Zeng Shaodong first pointed out that the current staffing of Zhejiang provincial-level organs greatly exceeded the original planned number, and that there were unreasonable phenomena. According to investigations, the following problems existed: some departments had large and overlapping institutions, and the phenomenon of documents traveling excessively was serious. Some urgent documents traveled within the organs for as long as 46 days, going back and forth more than ten times; there were too many personnel serving the organs, and the ratio of professional personnel to non-professional personnel was unreasonable. Some organs had too many personnel placed for accommodation, causing cadres to feel distressed due to lack of work. The meeting believed that streamlining institutions could not only save state funds but also play a positive role in overcoming bureaucracy and formalism in the organs and improving work efficiency.

The meeting proposed that it is necessary to reasonably organize institutions, staffing, and adapt the institutional staffing to the needs of the work. The staffing committees of each department and bureau under the provincial-level organs were instructed to submit their reorganization plans and main problems before May 10. In the course of the work, it is necessary to rely on the masses, widely mobilize the masses to launch bottom-up criticism, and fight against conservative thinking and bureaucracy. Each special district, city, and county in Zhejiang Province has established a staffing committee in accordance with the notice from the Provincial Staffing Committee.

Currently, the investigation and research team of the Provincial Staffing Committee has gone deep into the provincial industrial, agricultural, grain, forestry, and other departments, as well as the General Office of the Provincial People's Committee, to conduct investigation and research work with a focus.

    浙江省开始整顿机构紧缩编制
    本报杭州二十四日电　浙江省人民委员会在四月十一日成立了省编制委员会。
    四月十九日，浙江省编制委员会召开省级机关负责人会议，讨论整顿机构、紧缩编制的问题。浙江省人民委员会副秘书长曾少东在会上报告了浙江省一九五五年整顿机构、紧缩编制的工作计划。曾少东首先指出，浙江省级机关现行编制人员大大超过原定人数，并存在不合理现象，据调查有如下问题：有的部门机构庞大、重叠，公文旅行现象严重，有的紧急公文在机关内旅行达四十六天之久，往返周转十多次手续；为机关服务的人员多，业务人员和非业务人员的比例不合理。有的机关安插性的人员多，使干部因无工作而感到苦闷。会议认为，精简机构不仅可节省国家经费，而且对克服机关的官僚主义和文牍主义作风以及提高工作效率可以起积极作用。
    会议提出，必须合理编定机构、编定人员、使机构编制适应工作需要，并责成省级机关各厅、局编制委员会分会在五月十日前，提出本单位的整编方案和主要问题；在工作进行中要依靠群众，广泛发动群众展开自下而上的批评，向保守思想和官僚主义作斗争。浙江省各专区、市、县都已根据省编制委员会的通知分别成立了编制委员会。
    现在，省编制委员会调查研究组已深入到省工业、农业、粮食、林业等厅和省人民委员会办公厅重点地进行调查研究工作。
