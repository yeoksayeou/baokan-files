Xinhua News Agency, 31st Dispatch from Rangoon: Burmese Defence Minister U Ba Swe, in a speech at the 10th Burmese Anti-Japanese Day Commemoration Meeting on March 27th, spoke about the Asian-African Conference, saying that the aim of the conference was to discuss the liberation of colonial peoples and the prevention of world war.

U Ba Swe said that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, and Burmese Prime Minister U Nu have been endorsed by many countries. He also said that the friendship between China and Burma has been further consolidated.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 2nd Dispatch: The Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently published the first issue of the "Asian-African Conference Brief."

The brief's editorial stated that Indonesia is looking forward to welcoming delegates from various countries to the Asian-African Conference and is taking every measure it can to make the Asian-African Conference enjoyable and successful.

The editorial said that the brief was published on the suggestion of the Indonesian Prime Minister and with the agreement of the Joint Secretariat of the Asian-African Conference. The purpose of the brief is to promote public understanding of the aims, activities, and achievements of the Asian-African Conference.

The brief's editorial commented on the significance of convening the Asian-African Conference. The editorial stated, "For centuries, Southeast Asian countries have been subjected to the enslavement of colonial policies of Western countries. Colonialism separated these once-colonized countries, preventing them from close cooperation. As colonies, they have always been pushed behind and have never participated in the resolution of world problems, or even in the resolution of problems concerning their own destiny. They were in a position of being enslaved by Western countries, never allowed to develop their natural resources to benefit their national economies, and therefore, they are economically backward."

The editorial quoted Indonesian Prime Minister's broadcast speech during his visit to New Delhi in September 1954, "Asians must decide their own future without interference from the Western world. There used to be the slogan: 'Let Asians fight Asians.' This is exactly what we don't need. What we need is to cooperate with our Asian and African neighbors, live together in friendship and peaceful coexistence, and unite to struggle for the common interests of us all."

    缅甸国防部长吴巴瑞谈亚非会议的目的
    “亚非会议简报”指出亚非国家需要和平共处
    新华社三十一日讯　仰光消息：缅甸国防部长吴巴瑞三月二十七日在缅甸第十届抗日节纪念大会上发表演说谈到亚非会议时说，会议的目的是要讨论殖民地人民解放的问题和防止世界战争的问题。
    吴巴瑞说，中国总理周恩来、印度总理尼赫鲁和缅甸总理吴努倡导的和平共处的五项原则，已经得到了很多国家的赞同。他还说，中缅两国的友谊已经更加巩固。
    新华社雅加达二日电　印度尼西亚外交部最近出版了第一期“亚非会议简报”。
    简报的社论说，印度尼西亚正在期待着欢迎参加亚非会议的各国代表们，并且正在采取它所能够采取的一切办法来使亚非会议开得愉快和成功。
    社论说，简报是由印度尼西亚总理建议并取得亚非会议联合秘书处同意后出版的。简报的目的是要促进公众对于亚非会议的目的、活动和成就的了解。
    简报的社论评述了召开亚非会议的意义。社论说，“若干世纪以来，东南亚国家备受西方国家殖民政策的奴役。殖民主义把这些一度沦为殖民地的国家分开，使它们不能紧密合作。作为殖民地，它们一向被推在后面，从来没有参加过世界问题的解决，甚至从来没有参加过有关它们自己的命运的问题的解决。它们处于受西方国家奴役的地位，从来不容许它们开发自然资源以有利于它们的国民经济，因此，它们在经济上是落后的。”
    社论引用印度尼西亚总理在一九五四年九月访问新德里期间发表的广播演说中的话说，“亚洲人必须决定他们自己的前途而不受西方世界的干涉。曾经有过这样的口号：‘让亚洲人打亚洲人’。这正是我们所不需要的。我们所需要的是同我们的亚洲和非洲的邻国合作，在友好与和平共处中生活在一起，团结一致为我们大家的共同利益而奋斗。”
