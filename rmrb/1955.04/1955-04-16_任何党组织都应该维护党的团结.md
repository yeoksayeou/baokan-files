Any Party Organization Should Safeguard the Party's Unity
Yi Huai

"The Party's unity, the working class's unity, the working people's unity, and the unity of all the people in the country are the fundamental guarantees for the victory of the revolution."
(Communique of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party) No matter when or under what circumstances, as long as there are any shortcomings in the state of our Party's unity, the Party's cause will suffer losses. We cannot think that only the disunity of high-level Party committees and high-level cadres affects the Party's cause. In fact, the disunity of any level of Party organization, even the Party's grassroots organization, is very detrimental to the Party's cause. The situation of the Party organization in Cao Sheng Village, Hong Zhao County, Shanxi Province, is a clear example.

In the Xi'an Township Party organization of Hong Zhao County, there were two Communist Party members, one named Hou Tiangui, who was the secretary of the village branch; and one named Chen Youren, who was the deputy secretary of the township branch. Hou Tiangui and Chen Youren shared life and death, and shared weal and woe in the fierce national liberation struggles and class struggles such as the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and land reform, closely relying on the masses and overcoming those most difficult years. However, when the Party defeated the enemy, the people took control of the government, and the peasants of Cao Sheng Village began to engage in production and construction, this pair of close comrades-in-arms who had experienced the test of arduous struggles began to engage in great disunity.

After the land reform, Hou Tiangui and Chen Youren each led a mutual aid team. In the spring of 1953, the mutual aid team led by Hou Tiangui was transformed into the "Xiang Ming" agricultural production cooperative. At that time, Chen Youren requested to join the cooperative. However, because his mutual aid team was not doing well, the cooperative members did not approve his membership. Chen Youren was very dissatisfied with Hou Tiangui because of this matter. Dominated by this personal emotion, Chen Youren forgot the responsibilities that a deputy secretary of the Party branch should bear for the mutual aid and cooperation movement. He not only did not do his best to support and help the work of the "Xiang Ming" cooperative and use the facts of the "Xiang Ming" cooperative to publicize the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives among the masses, but instead, he spread sarcastic remarks everywhere, ridiculing and mocking Hou Tiangui and the "Xiang Ming" cooperative he led. Hou Tiangui was the same. Because he was dissatisfied with Chen Youren, he not only did not help Chen Youren's mutual aid team through the "Xiang Ming" cooperative, so that the mutual aid team could be continuously consolidated and improved, but instead, he talked everywhere about Chen Youren's mutual aid team not doing well and being unable to transform into a cooperative, and so on. In the spring of 1954, the mutual aid team led by Chen Youren was transformed into the "Guang Mang" agricultural production cooperative. Because Hou Tiangui and Chen Youren, the two cooperative directors, were not united, the two cooperatives did not help each other and move forward hand in hand, but instead, they squeezed each other out, undermined each other, and frequently made disputes on the pretext of something. During the wheat harvest in 1954, the "Xiang Ming" cooperative did not have a threshing ground for collective threshing and wanted to use the village's theater ground. Chen Youren then appeared in his capacity as deputy secretary of the township branch, using the excuse of letting the masses dry wheat and not allowing the "Xiang Ming" cooperative to use the ground. Hou Tiangui ignored the busy farming season and went to the township, district, and even the county to sue Chen Youren. During the autumn harvest, both cooperatives wanted to exclusively occupy the school's yard to harvest autumn grain (the school was on vacation at the time), and neither would give way. As a result, both of them put aside the autumn harvest and went to court all the way to the county committee. In August 1954, both cooperatives began to expand. Chen Youren and Hou Tiangui did not, under the unified leadership of the branch, plan and arrange the collectivization movement in the entire village in a planned manner, but instead, used the method of you suppressing me and me squeezing you out to indiscriminately recruit cooperative members. The "Guang Mang" cooperative seized the opportunity of two cooperative members of the "Xiang Ming" cooperative fighting and publicized everywhere how bad the "Xiang Ming" cooperative was, taking the opportunity to "mobilize" one hundred and three peasant households to join their cooperative. When Hou Tiangui saw this, fearing that his cooperative would not be able to absorb new cooperative members, he also hurriedly took "emergency measures," rushing to "mobilize" sixty-three households to join the "Xiang Ming" cooperative. Because the two of them were not united, they did not often hold Party meetings, and when they did hold them, the Party members of the two cooperatives were separated and held their own meetings, putting the Party branch in a state of division; even when they met together, they ignored each other. The leading cadres of the Party and the cooperatives were not united, and the cooperative members also followed suit, satirizing and ridiculing each other, engaging in petty sectarianism.

The two cooperatives' unprincipled disputes made it impossible for the cadres sent by the agricultural technology station to work in Cao Sheng Village. The conditions of the agricultural production cooperative in Xia Zhuang Village were originally not as good as the two cooperatives in Cao Sheng Village. However, under the guidance and assistance of the agricultural technology station, the average yield of cotton per mu was 350 jin last year. The average yield of cotton per mu in the two cooperatives in Cao Sheng Village was only 300 jin. As a result of Hou Tiangui and Chen Youren's disunity, this single item reduced the income of the two cooperatives by 100 million yuan (old currency). This incident clearly shows that no matter when, as long as there is any defect in the unity of the Party organization, bourgeois ideology will immediately take advantage of the opportunity. Isn't the disunity of the Cao Sheng Village branch a good example? When Chen Youren and Hou Tiangui were engaging in great disunity, in this branch and in these two agricultural production cooperatives, in reality, the bourgeois ideology and style of work had already gained the upper hand. In dealing with the relationship between the two cooperatives, they had completely departed from socialist principles and adopted bourgeois means of mutual exclusion and mutual attack. The phenomenon of disunity itself is a manifestation of the bourgeois ideology and style of work; once the leading cadres of a Party organization are infected with this kind of thinking, they will lose their sense of smell to bourgeois ideology, and the Party organization will open the door to bourgeois ideology. Once bourgeois ideology spreads and grows within the Party, the implementation of the Party's various policies will encounter obstacles, and our socialist construction and socialist transformation will be harmed. The disunity of the leading cadres of the Cao Sheng Village branch caused such a great loss to the mutual aid and cooperation movement in this village. Isn't this exactly what our enemies are very happy about? What deserves our vigilance is that situations like the Cao Sheng Village branch are not very isolated phenomena within our Party. In the countryside, in villages with several cooperatives, cooperatives often cannot completely handle problems according to socialist principles, and to varying degrees, they engage in disunity like the Cao Sheng Village branch. In factories, leading cadres of Party organizations and administrative leading cadres also often engage in unprincipled disputes, so that the leadership core cannot be united, affecting the comprehensive completion of the state plan. And these leading cadres often do not sufficiently recognize the serious harm of this kind of unprincipled dispute, always feeling that a little dispute between individuals has little impact on production. From the situation of the Cao Sheng Village branch, it can be seen how harmful this idea is!

The Hong Zhao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has already made a more thorough resolution of the disunity problem between Chen Youren and Hou Tiangui in accordance with the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party. Now the unity of Chen Youren and Hou Tiangui and the members of these two agricultural production cooperatives has been greatly improved. However, this matter is by no means an accidental event in a village Party organization. There are still quite a few Party organizations in which this kind of disunity exists to varying degrees. Therefore, we should draw sufficient lessons from this matter.

    任何党组织都应该维护党的团结

    “党的团结，工人阶级的团结，劳动人民的团结，全国人民的团结，是革命胜利的基本保证。”
  （党的七届四中全会公报）不论在任何时候任何情况下，只要我们党的团结状况稍有缺点，党的事业就会受到损失。我们不能认为只有高级党委和高级干部的不团结才影响党的事业，实际上，任何一级党组织，甚至党的基层组织的不团结，对党的事业也是很不利的。山西省洪赵县曹生村党组织的情况就是一个明显的例子。
    洪赵县西安乡党组织里有两个共产党员，一个叫侯天贵，是村分支部书记；一个叫陈友仁，是乡支部副书记。侯天贵和陈友仁在抗日战争、解放战争、土地改革等激烈的民族解放斗争和阶级斗争中，同生死，共患难，亲密团结，紧紧依靠群众，渡过了那些最艰难的岁月。可是，当党战胜了敌人，人民掌握了政权，曹生村农民开始进行生产建设的时候，这一对经历过艰苦斗争考验的亲密战友却大闹起不团结来了。
    土地改革以后，侯天贵和陈友仁各自领导了一个互助组。一九五三年春天，侯天贵领导的互助组转成了“向明”农业生产合作社。当时陈友仁要求入社。可是，因为他领导的互助组搞得不好，社员们没有通过他入社。陈友仁因为这件事就很不满意侯天贵。在这种个人情绪支配下，陈友仁就忘记了一个党的支部副书记对互助合作运动应负的责任。他不但不尽力支持和帮助“向明”社的工作，用
  “向明”社的事实在群众中宣传农业生产合作社的优越性，反而到处说风凉话，讽刺、嘲笑侯天贵和他领导的“向明”社。侯天贵也是同样，因为不满意陈友仁，就不但不通过“向明”社去帮助陈友仁的互助组，使互助组能够不断地巩固和提高，反而到处讲陈友仁的互助组搞得不好，转不了社，等等。一九五四年春，陈友仁领导的互助组转成了“光芒”农业生产合作社。因为侯天贵和陈友仁这两个社长不团结，这两个社就不是互相帮助，携手前进，而是互相排挤，互相拆台，经常借故闹纠纷。一九五四年麦收时，“向明”社集体打麦没有场，要用村上的戏场。陈友仁便用乡支部副书记身份出现，借口让群众晒麦，不准“向明”社用场。侯天贵就不顾农忙，找到乡、区以至县里去告陈友仁的状。秋收时，两个社都要独占学校的院子收打秋粮（当时学校放假），谁也不让谁。于是，两个人都放下秋收不管，又打官司一直打到县委会。一九五四年八月，两个社都开始扩大。陈友仁、侯天贵不是在支部的统一领导下，有计划地统筹安排全村的合作化运动，而是用你压倒我、我排挤你的办法去乱拉社员。“光芒”社抓住了“向明”社两个社员打架的空子，到处宣扬“向明”社如何如何不好，趁机“动员”了一百零三户农民加入他们的社。侯天贵一看，怕自己的社吸收不了新社员，也赶忙采取了“紧急措施”，抢着“动员”了六十三户加入“向明”社。因为他们两个人闹不团结，连党的会议也不常开了，要开也是两个社的党员分开，各开各的，使党的支部处于分裂状态；即使一起开会，他们也是互不理睬。党和社的领导干部不团结，社员们也跟着互相讽刺、嘲笑，闹小宗派。
    两个社这样无原则地闹纠纷，使农业技术站派去的干部没办法在曹生村进行工作。下庄村农业生产合作社的条件本来不如曹生村的两个社好，但是，他们在农业技术站的指导帮助下，去年每亩棉田平均产棉三百五十斤。曹生村两个社每亩棉田平均只产棉三百斤。侯天贵和陈友仁闹不团结的结果，单是这一项就使两个社减少收入一亿元（旧币）。这件事很清楚地说明了：不论什么时候，只要党组织的团结状况一有缺点，资产阶级思想立即就会乘隙而入。曹生村支部的不团结难道不是一个很好的例子吗？当陈友仁和侯天贵大闹不团结的时候，在这个支部以及这两个农业生产合作社中，实际上，资产阶级的思想作风已经占了上风。他们在处理两个社的关系时，已经完全离开了社会主义原则，而采用资产阶级的互相排挤互相打击的手段。闹不团结这个现象本身就是资产阶级思想作风的表现；一个党组织的领导干部一经沾染了这种思想，他们就会对资产阶级思想失掉嗅觉，党组织也就会对资产阶级思想敞开大门。而资产阶级思想一经在党内蔓延滋长起来，党的各种政策的贯彻执行就会遇到障碍，我们的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业就会受到损害。曹生村支部的领导干部不团结，这个村的互助合作运动就受到这么大的损失，这不正是我们的敌人所十分欢迎的吗？值得引起我们警惕的是，像曹生村支部这样的情况在我们党内并不是很个别的现象。在农村中，一个村有几个社的，社与社之间往往不能完全按照社会主义原则来处理问题，而程度不同地像曹生村支部这样闹不团结。在工厂中党组织的领导干部和行政领导干部也常常闹无原则纠纷，使领导核心不能团结一致，影响国家计划的全面完成。而这些领导干部对这种无原则纠纷的严重危害性往往认识不足，总觉得个人之间闹点纠纷，对生产的影响不大。从曹生村支部的情况可以看出这种想法是多么有害！
    陈友仁和侯天贵的不团结问题，中共洪赵县委会已经根据党的四中全会的精神，做了比较彻底的解决。现在陈友仁和侯天贵以及这两个农业生产合作社的社员们的团结状况已经有了很大的改进。但是，这件事决不是一个村子的党组织里偶然发生的事情，还有相当多的党组织中不同程度地存在着这种不团结的现象，因此我们应该从这件事情中吸取足够的教训。
