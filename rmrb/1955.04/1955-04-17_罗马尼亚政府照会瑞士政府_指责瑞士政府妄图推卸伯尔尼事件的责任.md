Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 16th: According to TASS, the Romanian government, in a note to the Swiss government on the 14th, stated that the Swiss government, in its note of March 23, disregards the principles of international law and attempts to evade all responsibility for the attack on the Romanian Embassy in Switzerland.

The Romanian government insists that the Swiss government should take all measures to search for and arrest all criminals who participated in the attack on the embassy, as well as their accomplices and instigators.

In view of the Swiss government's refusal to hand over the criminals, the Romanian government reminds it that, in this matter, the Swiss government must fully bear the international responsibility for punishing the criminals.

At the same time, the Romanian government protests against the consistent slandering of the Romanian People's Republic by some Swiss newspapers, their sympathy for the criminals, and their incitement to new murders and provocations against the Romanian Embassy.

The note concludes by saying that the Romanian government insists that the Swiss government should, in accordance with the principles of international law and for the sake of the relations between the two countries, satisfy the Romanian government's justified demands: compensation for the spiritual and material losses of the Romanian People's Republic.

    指责瑞士政府妄图推卸伯尔尼事件的责任
    新华社十六日讯　据塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚政府在十四日照会瑞士政府说：瑞士政府在它三月二十三日的照会中无视国际法的准则，企图把它对罗马尼亚驻瑞士公使馆受袭击这件事应负的一切责任推卸干净。
    罗马尼亚政府坚持：瑞士政府应该采取一切办法，来搜寻和逮捕参加袭击公使馆的所有犯罪分子以及他们的同谋者和煽动者。
    鉴于瑞士政府拒绝交出罪犯，罗马尼亚政府提醒它注意：在这件事情上，瑞士政府必须完全担负惩处罪犯的国际责任。
    同时，罗马尼亚政府对于一部分瑞士报纸一贯诬蔑罗马尼亚人民共和国、同情罪犯和煽动对罗马尼亚公使馆进行新的谋杀和挑衅活动表示抗议。
    照会最后说：罗马尼亚政府坚持：瑞士政府应该按照国际法准则并且为两国关系的利益考虑，满足罗马尼亚政府理直气壮的要求：赔偿罗马尼亚人民共和国在精神上和物质上的损失。
