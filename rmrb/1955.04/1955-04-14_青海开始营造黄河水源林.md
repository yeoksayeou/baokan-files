    Qinghai Province has begun work on creating a Yellow River source forest. The afforestation area is mainly on both banks of the Yellow River and its tributaries, with a planned total of 31,500 mu of forest, most of which is required to be completed in the spring. To ensure a high survival rate, according to climatic and other conditions, a large number of easily grown poplar trees will be planted in the river valley areas, drought-resistant elm and apricot trees will be planted in the mountains, and wild seedlings such as birch, spruce, and aspen will be fully utilized for transplantation on barren mountains in high-altitude and cold areas. Recently, the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry convened forestry personnel from various places to exchange advanced afforestation experiences. At the same time, three afforestation work groups were sent to various afforestation areas to help the masses solve difficult problems in afforestation.

    青海开始营造黄河水源林
    青海省营造黄河水源林的工作开始了。造林地区主要是在黄河两岸及其支流地区，计划共造林三万一千五百亩，大部分要求在春季完成。为了保证高度的成活率，根据气候等条件，在川水地区将大量栽植易种易长的杨树，山地种植耐旱的榆树和杏树，在高寒的荒山上将充分利用桦、云杉、山杨等野生幼苗进行移植。最近，青海省农林厅曾召集各地林业人员进行座谈，交流了植树的先进经验。同时派出三个造林工作组分赴各造林地区，帮助群众解决造林中的疑难问题。
