Comrades, dear friends:

I have accepted an exciting task, which is to represent the Czechoslovak government at the second industrial and cultural exhibition of Czechoslovakia held in the People's Republic of China. We are honored that this exhibition can be held in the beautiful exhibition hall, which marks the true friendship between the Soviet people and the people of China. This exhibition is named "Exhibition of Achievements in Ten Years of Socialist Construction in Czechoslovakia." In fact, there is no better way to illustrate the great achievements made by the Czechoslovak people in ten years of free life than through an exhibition. You know, the issue is not only that we have these excavators, cars, airplanes, lathes, and consumer goods, but first of all because these high-quality products are made by our own people, who use these products for economic construction and constantly enrich their own lives. We are honored to represent our freedom-loving and hard-working people at this exhibition; we are especially honored that this exhibition is held in Beijing, the capital of free China.

The exhibition we are opening today further proves that the economic and cultural relations between Great China and Czechoslovakia are constantly developing and consolidating. It will soon be five years since the first Czechoslovak trade delegation came to free China and signed the first trade agreement. In the past five years, our economic and cultural relations have greatly expanded. Chinese raw materials, food, and other commodities have greatly helped Czechoslovakia's socialist construction, while the products of our machine-building factories have also helped China accelerate its industrialization. This broad economic and cultural relationship, based on friendship, complete equality, mutual benefit and mutual assistance, is a testament to the friendly relations between the countries of our peace camp. Because of the existence of the peace camp, and because the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, successfully applied the ever-victorious Marxist-Leninist ideology in China, in the past five years, China has changed from a backward country exploited by foreign imperialism and the Kuomintang traitorous clique into a strong and truly peace-loving country loved by 600 million Chinese people and envied by billions of people in Asia and the world. For thousands of years, the Chinese people have been proud of their beautiful architecture and precious cultural treasures. However, only under the new regime can the creativity of the Chinese people be fully utilized. And today, the free Chinese people, under the leadership of the beloved Communist Party, are beginning to carry out tasks that have never been seen in the thousands of years of Chinese history, and that are impossible to achieve. The Chinese people are harnessing floods, building factories, constructing railways, and smoothly carrying out socialist industrialization throughout the country. They have eliminated hunger and poverty in the countryside, and are building a new life in the countryside with full confidence in accordance with the principles of mutual aid and cooperation. Czechoslovakia, under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, has also made many achievements in socialist construction in ten years of free life.

Since the heroic Soviet army liberated Czechoslovakia in 1945, the Czechoslovak people have resolutely determined to follow the socialist and communist road taken by the heroic Soviet people. At this exhibition, you can see some of the achievements we have made on this road.

In ten years of free and happy life without capitalists and foreign plunderers, the Czechoslovak people have restored the economy destroyed by the war, and have made remarkable achievements in developing the country's industry. Please allow me to cite a few examples that can prove these achievements: Today, Czechoslovak industrial products have increased by 128 percent compared to the pre-war period, of which heavy industrial products, which are the basis for further development, have increased by 142 percent, electricity has increased by 231 percent, coal has increased by 30 percent, lignite has increased by 106 percent, coking coal has increased by 92 percent, pig iron has increased by 67 percent… etc.

The further vigorous development and prosperity of our national economy, our people's love and diligence in labor, the great assistance of the Soviet Union, and the friendly cooperation of the people's democratic countries with the People's Republic of China occupying an important position, all of this has enabled our party and government to implement the recent fourth price reduction after the currency reform.

We have also made many great achievements in agriculture. Socialist state-owned farms, especially unified agricultural cooperatives, own about half of the country's arable land. Our industry provides small and medium-sized farmers and members of unified agricultural cooperatives with technically complete, high-quality agricultural machinery, and provides them with perfect technical assistance in continuously improving quality. All of this could only be enjoyed by landlords in the past.

Comrades! Dear friends! Although our two countries are separated by more than 10,000 kilometers, this cannot hinder our consolidated friendship and unity in the struggle for peace. Although we have only been in the People's Republic of China for a few days, we have already seen the Chinese people's joyful enthusiasm for labor, which is so close to our people. Therefore, China, like Czechoslovakia and other countries in the peace camp, has enthusiastically responded to the call of the World Peace Council to ban weapons of mass destruction. Therefore, the vast majority of people in the world advocate and support the peace policy of the Soviet Union, the leading force of the peace camp. Comrades! Dear friends! Finally, please allow me to once again express our great joy and pride that we are able to represent the Czechoslovak people in your beautiful and glorious country. We will try our best to use our time here to better understand your country and the rich experience you have gained in revolutionary struggle and economic and political construction.

Long live the eternal friendship between the People's Republic of China and Czechoslovakia!

Long live the faithful friend and mentor of our two peoples - the Soviet Union!

Long live world peace!

### 在捷十年社会主义建设成就展览会开幕式上  捷克斯洛伐克副总理扬科夫卓娃的讲话

    在捷十年社会主义建设成就展览会开幕式上
    捷克斯洛伐克副总理扬科夫卓娃的讲话敬爱的同志们、亲爱的朋友们：
    我接受了一个令人兴奋的任务，就是代表捷克斯洛伐克政府出席捷克斯洛伐克在中华人民共和国举行的第二次工业和文化展览会。这次展览会能在美丽的、标志着苏联人民和人民中国人民之间真正友谊的展览馆里举办，我们感到很荣幸。这次展览会命名为“捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会”。事实上也找不到比展览会更好的方式来说明捷克斯洛伐克人民在十年的自由生活中所取得的各项巨大成就。要知道，问题并不仅仅在于我们有这些掘土机、汽车、飞机、车床和消费品，首先是因为这些质地优良的产品是我们人民自己制造的，他们用这些产品来进行经济建设，并不断地丰富自己的生活。我们能在这次展览会上代表自己爱好劳动的自由人民，感到很荣幸；我们特别感到荣幸的，是这次展览会在自由的中国的首都北京举行的。
    今天我们揭幕的展览会，进一步地证明了伟大中国和捷克斯洛伐克之间的经济和文化关系正在不断地发展和巩固。不久前，第一个捷克斯洛伐克贸易代表团来到自由的中国签订第一个贸易协定，已经快满五年了。在过去五年中，我们之间的经济和文化的关系大大地扩大了。中国的原料、食品以及其他商品大大地帮助了捷克斯洛伐克社会主义建设，而我们机器制造工厂的产品也帮助中国加速了它的工业化。这种建立在友好、完全平等和互利互助基础上的广泛的经济和文化关系，就是我们和平阵营各国之间友好关系的明证。由于和平阵营的存在，由于以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央委员会成功地在中国运用了无往而不胜的马克思列宁主义思想，在过去五年中，中国已由一个落后的、遭受外国帝国主义和国民党卖国集团剥削的国家，变成了一个为六亿中国人民所热爱的、为亚洲和全世界亿万人民所羡慕的、真正爱好和平的强大国家。几千年来，中国人民一直以自己美丽的建筑和珍贵的文化宝藏而引以为荣。然而，只有在新的政权下，中国人民的创造力才能得到充分发挥的机会。而今天的自由的中国人民在亲爱的共产党的领导下开始执行着几千年来中国历史上从未有过，而且也不可能有的任务。中国人民根治水患，建立工厂，修筑铁路，并在全国范围内顺利地进行着社会主义工业化，他们消灭了农村的饥饿和贫困，并满怀信心地按照互助合作的原则建设着农村的新生活。捷克斯洛伐克在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下，在自由生活的十年中，也在社会主义建设方面取得了许多成就。
    自从一九四五年英勇的苏军解放捷克斯洛伐克以后，捷克斯洛伐克人民坚决地确定了走英雄的苏联人民所走的社会主义和共产主义道路。在这次展览会上，你们可以看到我们在这条道路上所取得的一部分成就。
    在没有资本家和外国掠夺者的十年自由愉快的生活中，捷克斯洛伐克人民恢复了被战争所破坏的经济，并在发展国家的工业上取得了显著的成就。请允许我举几个能够证明这些成就的例子：今天捷克斯洛伐克工业产品比战前增加了百分之一百二十八，其中作为进一步发展基础的重工业产品则增加了百分之一百四十二，电力增加了百分之二百三十一，煤增加了百分之三十，褐煤增加了百分之一百零六，焦煤增加了百分之九十二，生铁增加了百分之六十七……等。
    我们国民经济的进一步大力的发展和繁荣，我们人民对劳动的爱好和勤勉，苏联的大力援助，以及以中华人民共和国占重要地位的各人民民主国家的友好合作，这一切使我们的党和政府在币制改革后能够实行最近的第四次降低物价。
    在农业方面我们也取得了许多巨大的成就。社会主义成份的国营农场，首先是统一农业合作社，约拥有全国一半的耕地。我们的工业为中小农民和统一农业合作社社员提供了技术完备的、质地优良的农业机器，并为他们在不断提高质量方面提供了完善技术的帮助。这一切在过去只有地主才能享受到的。
    同志们！亲爱的朋友们！虽然我们两国相隔一万多公里，但是并不能妨碍我们巩固的友谊和为和平斗争的团结一致。虽然，我们来到中华人民共和国还只不过几天，但是，我们已经看到了中国人民愉快的劳动热情，这种劳动热情对于我们人民是如此的亲切。因此，中国也像捷克斯洛伐克以及和平阵营各国一样，热烈地响应了世界和平理事会关于禁止大规模杀人武器的号召。因此，世界上绝大多数的人们都主张并拥护和平阵营的领导力量——苏联的和平政策。同志们！亲爱的朋友们！最后，请允许我再一次地表示我们的极大的愉快和骄傲，因为我们能够代表捷克斯洛伐克人民来到你们的美丽和光荣的国家。我们将尽力利用逗留这里的时间，来更好地了解你们的国家和你们在革命斗争和经济政治建设中所取得的丰富经验。
    中华人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克的永恒友谊万岁！
    我们两国人民的忠实朋友和导师——苏联万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
