Xinhua News Agency, April 24th, TASS Moscow, April 23rd: As previously reported by the newspapers, the Council of Ministers of the USSR has submitted proposals to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR regarding the abolition of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Franco-Soviet Treaty.

    As the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR is about to hold discussions on these two proposals from the Council of Ministers of the USSR, it has submitted these two proposals to the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Union Council and the Council of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, instructing these two committees to draw conclusions.

    Xinhua News Agency, April 24th, TASS Moscow, April 23rd: The Foreign Affairs Committees of the Union Council and the Council of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR held a joint meeting in the Kremlin on the 23rd, chaired by M.A. Suslov, a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. The meeting discussed the agreement between the Soviet Union and Iran, signed in Tehran on December 2, 1954, regarding the resolution of border and financial issues. This agreement has been approved by the Council of Ministers of the USSR and submitted to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR for approval. Now, this issue has been submitted by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR to the Foreign Affairs Committees for conclusions.

    V.M. Molotov, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR and a representative of the Supreme Soviet, delivered a report on the aforementioned Soviet-Iranian agreement at the meeting.

    M. Aliyev, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, stated that, according to Article 18 of the Soviet Constitution, he was entrusted by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan Republic to declare that the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan Republic agreed to the territorial modifications related to the implementation of the Soviet-Iranian agreement. He added that, although the modification of the border line meant transferring dozens of square kilometers of Azerbaijani territory to Iran, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan Republic supported the proposal to approve the aforementioned agreement in order to strengthen good-neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Iran.

    B. Ovezov (Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Council of Nationalities, stated that the Turkmen Republic agreed to the territorial division changes stipulated in the Soviet-Iranian agreement. Ovezov added that this agreement could completely resolve the Firyuza issue, which had long been a point of contention between the Soviet Union and Iran. Now, this issue has been resolved on mutually beneficial terms, with Iran recognizing the town of Firyuza as an integral part of Soviet territory, and Iran also receiving corresponding territorial compensation under this agreement.

    N.S. Patolichev (Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic) told the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Union Council that the Soviet-Iranian agreement was an example of a large country resolving important issues in its relations with a small country through equal and mutually beneficial negotiations.

    M.A. Suslov, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Union Council of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, pointed out that the Soviet-Iranian agreement was of great significance in consolidating good-neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Iran. He emphasized that this agreement was mutually beneficial to both sides. He also said that the remarks of many representatives regarding the attempts of certain Western countries to drag Iran into groups hostile to the Soviet Union were noteworthy. He expressed his belief that people in Iran would calmly assess the dangerous trend of participating in such groups. Suslov concluded by saying that, with sincerity on both sides, the Soviet-Iranian agreement could make a significant contribution to consolidating peace and security in the Near and Middle East.

    The Foreign Affairs Committees of the Union Council and the Council of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR approved the agreement between the Soviet Union and Iran regarding the resolution of border and financial issues, and decided to recommend that the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR approve this agreement.

    苏联最高苏维埃主席团责成联盟院和民族院外交委员会
    就关于废除英苏、法苏条约问题作出结论
    两院外交委员会通过苏联伊朗关于边界和财政问题的协定
    新华社二十四日讯　塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯：报纸前已报道，苏联部长会议已经向苏联最高苏维埃主席团提出了关于废除英苏条约和法苏条约的建议。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团因为快要就苏联部长会议这两项建议举行讨论，已经把这两项建议提交苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院的外交委员会，责成这两个委员会作出结论。
    新华社二十四日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯：苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院的外交委员会二十三日在克里姆林宫举行联席会议，由苏联最高苏维埃代表米·安·苏斯洛夫担任主席。会上讨论了苏联和伊朗一九五四年十二月二日在德黑兰签订的关于解决边界和财政问题的协定。这个协定已由苏联部长会议批准，并提交苏联最高苏维埃主席团批准。现在这个问题由苏联最高苏维埃主席团提交外交委员会作结论。
    苏联外交部长、最高苏维埃代表维·米·莫洛托夫在会上就上述苏联—伊朗协定作了报告。
    阿塞拜疆苏维埃社会主义共和国外交部长麦·阿利耶夫说，根据苏联宪法第十八条，他受阿塞拜疆共和国最高苏维埃主席团的委托，声明阿塞拜疆共和国最高苏维埃主席团同意同实现苏伊协定有关的领土修改。他又说，虽然国界线的修改意味着要把阿塞拜疆的几十平方公里土地转交给伊朗，然而为了加强苏联和伊朗之间的善邻关系，阿塞拜疆共和国最高苏维埃主席团支持关于批准上述协定的建议。
    民族院外交委员会委员巴·奥维佐夫（土库曼苏维埃社会主义共和国）说，土库曼共和国同意苏伊协定所规定的领土划分的更动。奥维佐夫又说，这个协定可以彻底地解决菲柳兹问题，而这个问题在长时期以来就是苏联同伊朗分歧的一个症结。现在这个问题在互利的条件下解决了，伊朗承认菲柳兹市镇为苏联领土不可分割的一部分，而伊朗也根据这个协定获得了相应的领土补偿。
    纳·斯·帕托利切夫（白俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国）对联盟院外交委员会说，苏联—伊朗协定是一个大国通过平等互利的谈判来解决它同小国关系中的重要问题的范例。
    苏联最高苏维埃联盟院外交委员会主席米·安·苏斯洛夫指出，苏联—伊朗协定在巩固苏联和伊朗之间的善邻关系方面有着重大的意义。他强调指出，这一协定是对两方面互有利益的。他还说，许多代表关于某些西方国家企图把伊朗拖入敌视苏联的集团这些谈话是值得注意的。他表示相信，在伊朗人们将会冷静地估计到参加这类集团的危险趋向。苏斯洛夫最后说，苏联—伊朗协定在双方都有诚意的情况下，是能够成为对巩固中近东和平和安全的事业的一种重大的贡献。
    苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院的外交委员会通过了苏联和伊朗之间关于解决边界问题和财政问题的协定，并且决定建议苏联最高苏维埃主席团批准这个协定。
