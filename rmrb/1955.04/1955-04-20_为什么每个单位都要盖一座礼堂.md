Why Does Every Unit Have to Build an Auditorium?
By Our Correspondent Li Yi

The jointly owned public-private Tangshan Huaxin Textile Factory spent one year and six months, and more than 700,000 yuan, to build a large auditorium with an area of more than 2,000 square meters. Inside this auditorium, there are spacious lounges and a fairly large dance hall. The lounges and dance hall both have smooth terrazzo floors, and even the stairs are terrazzo. Not only that, but each stair edge is inlaid with a cast copper pattern, which alone used 500 jin of copper. The auditorium also has a high and large stage, spacious dressing rooms backstage, and mobile lighting equipment in front of the stage. In addition, there is a music pit in front of the stage large enough to hold forty people. This is an auditorium that is both uneconomical and impractical. The Huaxin Textile Factory has more than 4,000 employees and operates on three shifts, making it rare to hold a general meeting of all employees more than a few times a year. To hold a general meeting, production must be stopped. Even in the entire city of Tangshan, there are few large gatherings of more than 2,000 people, let alone the fact that each factory and organization also has its own club or small auditorium. In the Huaxin Textile Factory's large auditorium, the music pit that can accommodate more than forty musicians is extremely tragic: it is filled with unused stools and chairs; the pit is covered with dust; and a cement podium has not yet been visited by a music conductor. This is not to say that no plays have been performed on this stage; Peking opera and Ping opera have been performed, but the music pit has never been used.

If we calmly look at the facts before us, we will find that this building is not an "urgent matter." The most pressing issue for the Huaxin Textile Factory is the housing problem for workers. According to comrades in the factory's trade union, at least 200 workers need to have their dormitory problems solved. Some workers' homes are more than ten li away from the factory, some workers are still living in hotels, and some worker couples even live separately and can only find a hotel to reunite on weekends. Many female workers live five or six li away from the factory and have to push baby carriages to and from work, which takes at least an hour and a half. If she is a worker who can look after three machines, she walks at least seventy or eighty li between the machines in eight hours. After work, plus breastfeeding, washing, and attending meetings, she is already exhausted, and most of their homes do not have a quiet place to rest. If the factory could provide them with housing, the situation would be greatly different. Why haven't the factory leaders thought of these things!

During the construction of this large auditorium, the worker comrades had already raised such questions: "How many dormitories could be built with the money used to build this large auditorium?" This criticism can be said to be very sincere.

The actions of the Huaxin Textile Factory can be said to be a trend in Tangshan. According to the person in charge of the Huaxin Textile Factory's auditorium construction, their design drawings for the auditorium had just been brought back from the province when they were borrowed by the Qixin Cement Factory for reference. The Huaxin Textile Factory delayed the start of construction for two months because of insufficient material preparation, and as a result, the Qixin Cement Factory built one first. Now, to the north of it, closer to it even, the Tangshan Steel Factory is building an auditorium, and the wooden frame has already been erected. Why must they have their own large auditorium? I hope these units will reconsider!

### 为什么每个单位都要盖一座礼堂

    为什么每个单位都要盖一座礼堂
    本报记者　李翼
    公私合营唐山华新纺织厂，费了一年零六个月的功夫，花了七十多万元，盖了一座面积二千多平方公尺的大礼堂。在这座礼堂里，附有宽大的休息室，有一个相当大的舞厅。休息室和舞厅都是光滑的水磨石地，连楼梯也是水磨石的。这还不算，每阶楼梯的边缘，还敷有一条熔铸的铜花图案，这一项所用的铜就有五百斤。礼堂内还有既高且大的舞台，后台有宽敞的化装室，前台有活动照明设备。此外，舞台前还有一座足容四十个人的音乐池。这是一座既不经济又不适用的礼堂。华新纺织厂一共有四千多职工，又是三班作业，一年也难得开几次全体大会。要开大会，除非是停止生产。就说全唐山市吧，上两千人的大集会也是不多的，何况各厂各机关也还有自己的俱乐部或者小礼堂呢。在华新纺织厂的大礼堂里，那座可容纳四十多人的大乐队的音乐池更是悲哀极了：里边放的是些不用的凳子椅子；池子里落满了灰尘；一座水泥做的指挥台，至今还没有一个音乐指挥光顾过。这倒不是说，在这座舞台上还没有演过戏，曾演过京剧、评剧，只是没有一次使用过这音乐池。
    如果平静地看看眼前的事实，便会发现这个建筑并不是“当务之急”。华新纺织厂当前最迫切的是工人住宅问题。据厂工会的同志们说，目前至少有二百个工人需要解决宿舍问题，有些工人的家离工厂十几里，有的工人还在住店，甚至有的工人夫妇平时分居，休息日才能找客店去团圆。有不少女工住在离工厂五六里地的地方，上下班要推着婴儿车子走，至少要走一个半小时，如果她是一个能看三台机器的工人，在八小时里来往于机器之间所走的路，至少也有七、八十里，下了班，再加上给孩子喂奶、梳洗、开会，身体就够疲倦的了，而她们的家里，大都没有安静的休息地方。如果工厂能给她们住宅，这情况就会大大不同了，工厂的领导人们为什么不想到这些呢！
    就在这座大礼堂建筑当中，工人同志们也早已提出了这样的问题：“用盖这个大礼堂的钱，该盖多少宿舍啊？”这批评该说是非常恳切的。
      像华新纺织厂这种作为，在唐山该说是一股风。据华新纺织厂大礼堂建筑负责人说，他们这座大礼堂的设计图刚从省里拿来，就被启新水泥厂借去参考了，华新纺织厂因为材料准备不足，耽误了两个月才开工，结果是启新水泥厂先盖上了一座。现在呢，就在离它还近一些的北边，唐山钢厂正在建筑一座礼堂，木架子已搭起来了，为什么一定要自己有一座大礼堂呢？希望这些单位重新考虑一下吧！
