The current important task for state-owned commercial warehouse management departments is to do a good job in warehouse storage management and ensure that goods are not damaged during the summer.

However, some warehouse management cadres say this: managing a warehouse is just "receiving and dispatching goods, watching the stacks and counting the numbers." As long as the stored goods are the right amount, the quality of the goods depends on the warehouse's equipment conditions and is not the responsibility of the storage personnel. The warehouse management department calls this thinking the "just watching the stacks" mentality.

Under the control of this mentality, the No. 1 warehouse of the Shenyang Storage and Transportation Company developed a strange "trick," which is to "issue guarantee strips." Last July, when a batch of cotton clothes was put into the warehouse by the Clothing and Wool Wholesale Department of the Shenyang Department Store Company, the warehouse issued a "guarantee strip" stating, "Cotton clothes are a bit damp when entering the warehouse, and we will not be responsible for anything after this." Relying on this "guarantee strip," they really didn't care, and later the cotton clothes grew mold. The warehouse department used the dampness at the time of entry as a reason to insist that it had nothing to do with their storage department. This kind of irresponsible phenomenon towards state property is by no means isolated in warehouse storage work.

The "just watching the stacks" mentality is the main reason for the large-scale damage to state property. Storage staff should realize that the goods entering and leaving the warehouse are the fruits of the hard work of the working people. Doing a good job in storage management can not only speed up the commodity turnover rate of state-owned commercial departments and reduce circulation costs, but also meet the needs of the vast consumers and save state property. Storage work should not only ensure the quantity of goods, but more importantly, ensure the quality of the goods. If brand-new cotton clothes grow mold, can we still find customers for them? Although there is still a stack of clothes, they have changed their appearance and cannot be sold. Isn't this failing to "watch" even the "stacks"?

At present, the state is concentrating its main efforts on heavy industry construction, and it is not possible to allocate large sums of money to build some modern warehouses for the commercial departments. Most of the warehouse equipment is still not good, and storage work has certain difficulties. However, as long as the storage staff can attach importance to this work, have a high sense of responsibility for storing state property, pay attention to inspections in a timely manner, and do a good job in prevention, storage work can be done well.

Summer is the most difficult season to store goods. Warehouse storage personnel must conduct in-depth inspections and make preparations as soon as possible to ensure that goods safely get through the summer.

    “看堆”思想是错误的
    牟澜
    做好仓库保管工作，保证商品在夏季不遭损坏，这是国营商业仓库保管部门当前的重要任务。
    但是，在仓库管理干部中有这样一种说法：管理仓库嘛，就是“收货发货，看堆点数”，只要保管的商品不多不少够数就行，至于商品质量，就得看仓库设备的条件来决定，不是保管人员的事。仓库保管部门把这种思想叫“看堆”思想。
    在这种思想的支配下，沈阳市仓储公司第一仓库出现了一个奇怪的“窍门”，就是“打保条”。去年七月间，沈阳市百货公司服装毛织品批发部有一批棉衣入库时，仓库打了个“保条”，上面写着“棉服入库有些潮湿，以后概不负责”。他们就凭着这张“保条”，真的不闻不问，后来果然棉服上长毛了，仓库部门就以入库时潮湿为理由，硬说同他们保管部门无关。像这种对国家财富不负责任的现象，在仓库保管工作中绝不是个别的。
    “看堆”思想是使国家财富大量遭受损坏的主要原因。保管工作人员应该认识到：仓库里进出的商品，都是劳动人民辛勤劳动的成果。保管工作做得好，既能加快国营商业部门商品流转速度和降低流转费用，也可满足广大消费者的需要和节省国家财富。保管工作不仅要保证商品的数量，更重要的是要保证商品的质量。崭新的棉服长上了毛，难道还能找到它的主顾吗？衣服虽还有一堆，但却变了样子，卖不出去，这不是连“堆”也没有“看”住吗？
    目前国家正集中主要力量进行重工业建设，还不可能拿出大笔款子来给商业部门修建一些现代化的仓库，大部分仓库设备还不好，保管工作是有一定的困难的。但是只要保管工作人员能够重视这一工作，对保管国家财富有高度的责任心，及时注意检查，做好预防工作，是可以做好保管工作的。
    夏季是商品最难保管的季节，仓库保管人员必须及早深入检查，做好准备，让商品安全渡过夏季。
