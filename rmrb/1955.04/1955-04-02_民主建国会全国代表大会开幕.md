Guests Chen Shutong, Li Jishen, and Shen Junru delivered speeches at the congress, warmly congratulating the opening of the first National Congress of the China Democratic National Construction Association.

Chen Shutong said at the meeting that in recent years, the China Democratic National Construction Association has cultivated many backbone members who actively accept socialist transformation among the vast number of industrialists and businessmen. Most members of the China Democratic National Construction Association have played a leading role in the industrial and commercial circles. The China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce have cooperated well in the past in the work of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, they will cooperate more closely in the future and contribute their greatest strength to the cause of socialist transformation.

Li Jishen said that our Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the China Democratic National Construction Association are comrades-in-arms in the people's democratic united front under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. In the long and complex struggle of the Chinese revolution, we have jointly experienced a difficult and tortuous road and have a deep fighting friendship. In the struggle for socialist construction and socialist transformation of the country, we are advancing towards a common goal. During the transition period, the ideological remolding of the members of our Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang is also an extremely important political task. We hope to learn from your experience and help our members and the masses we are connected with to better carry out socialist transformation.

Shen Junru said that the China Democratic National Construction Association and the China Democratic League are fraternal parties. In the past, in the struggle of the New Democratic Revolution, and in the future, in the cause of socialist construction, they are both assistants and friends of the Communist Party of China. I hope that we will all work together to smoothly complete the cause of socialist transformation and build our great motherland into a prosperous and happy socialist society.

The congress adjourned at 5:10 p.m.
