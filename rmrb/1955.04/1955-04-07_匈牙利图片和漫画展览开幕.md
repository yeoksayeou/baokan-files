Hungarian Photo and Cartoon Exhibition Opens

The "Tenth Anniversary of the Hungarian People's Republic" Photo Exhibition and the Hungarian Cartoon Exhibition opened on the 4th at Zhongshan Park in Beijing. These two exhibitions are sponsored by the Bureau for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries of the People's Republic of China to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Hungary's liberation.

The "Tenth Anniversary of the Hungarian People's Republic" Photo Exhibition displays nearly two hundred pictures, introducing the natural scenery of Hungary, the revolutionary struggles of the Hungarian people, the construction achievements after Hungary's liberation, and the happy life of the Hungarian people. The Hungarian Cartoon Exhibition includes fifty-five cartoons, most of which take the exposure of warmongers and the defense of peace as their themes.
