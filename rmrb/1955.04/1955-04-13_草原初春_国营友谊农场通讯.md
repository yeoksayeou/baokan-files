    Early Spring on the Grassland
    —Correspondence from the State-Owned Friendship Farm
    Yao Liwen, Qiao Yuzhou
    As soon as the jeep left Xinglong Town, it drove into the vast grassland like the sea. On sunny days, the ice and snow in the grass have melted. Farmers from nearby villages are harrowing the land. On the thawing road, cars splash mud from time to time as they pass by. The cries of the "E'ling" bird bring the message of spring to the people.
    The car continued to drive into the depths of the grassland. Last winter, we followed comrades from the land consolidation survey team to this grassland. At that time, wild chickens slowly dodged the occasional cars that came by; now, trucks carrying fuel, wood, and cement have to screech to avoid convoys of rubber-wheeled carts carrying sand and stones. In early spring, the noise of people, animals, and machines is awakening this long-dormant grassland. This scene brings boundless joy to the pioneers of the grassland. Wang Zhenglin, the deputy director of the farm, sitting in the jeep, introduced the farm's construction to the newly arrived Soviet experts, and pointed to the villages and sheds in the distance, asking the translator, Xiao Wang, what those places were. Each time, Xiao Wang replied with a smile that he didn't know. The clever driver came to Xiao Wang's rescue: "That's 'Caofangtun' (Straw House Village)!" This answer startled everyone, and they quickly understood and laughed.
    The grassland is changing. These barren lands, which were recently inhabited by roe deer and pheasants, now have rows of sheds and straw houses, which the driver called "Caofangtun."
    We arrived at the residence of the Fourth Branch Farm. A moving scene of construction was presented before us. In front of a row of low thatched huts, there were four green houses on wheels - camp cars. Next to it, three tall straw sheds and a reed shed have been set up. A few feet of sand, stones, and wood are piled up around the south side of the thatched huts, tens of meters away. On the open space to the north, there are seeders, disc harrows, and tall combine harvesters, as well as eye-catching ochre and grey large oil tanks. In front of the two tractors, the tractor drivers are carefully wiping the machines, and other tractor drivers have driven the tractors out for light-load test runs (harrowing the land along the way). The entire "village" is immersed in the roar of tractors....
    Spring comes late on the grassland. A month ago, the south of the motherland was already full of singing birds and lush grass, but here the grassland was still covered with one or two feet of snow. The first batch of seven staff members of the Fourth Branch Farm came here with a small pot, a bag of flour, and corn. There were no roads, so they shoveled away the snow and built roads. There were no houses, so Zhou, the head of the branch farm, personally led the tractor drivers to pull wood from the mountains hundreds of miles away to build the houses. When a strong wind blew down the newly built house frame, people put it back up again. When there was no water to drink, they went to fetch water from more than ten miles away every day, and dug a well in the wilderness... No difficulty can hinder the progress of the work.
    People greeted the spring with hard work. Now, the seeders and disc harrows have been installed; the huge oil tanks have stored enough fuel for spring plowing and sowing; hundreds of tons of seeds have been transported to the site; the seed mixing machine is speeding up its rotation. Every night, people can see the tractor groups running in trial operation, radiating dazzling lights as they return from the fields; late at night, the tractor drivers are still enthusiastically discussing the competition conditions; the trade union cadres are drawing up charts for the future competition... All this heralds that a season of battle is about to begin.
                    ×　×　×
    We would like to know: on the eve of this tense battle, what are the young tractor drivers and pioneers thinking, what are their moods, what are their hopes and joys?
    We visited many of them.
    At noon on April 1st, in the straw shed where the tractor drivers of the Ninth Production Team lived, most of the tractor drivers had gone to the fields, and a few tractor drivers on the night shift were resting or reading. Here, we saw Li Naiwen, the leader of the 19th chartered group of the Stalin 80 tractor, and chatted with him. "The comrades in the group are very energetic," said Li Naiwen. He also talked about the situation of their group yesterday: The farm tool operator Fan Jinbao shook the seed mixing machine for a whole day, and had just returned from the temporary residence of the Fifth Branch Farm. Hearing that night shift operations had been added, he and another farm tool operator, Zheng Wangui, joined the night shift work. They didn't return from the fields until after one o'clock in the morning. Li Naiwen worked a day shift, and then continued to work for six or seven hours at night. He was so tired that when he woke up, it was already seven o'clock in the morning. He thought that he and the comrades on the night shift needed to sleep well, but then he thought that the co-driver Liu Caojie used to drive kerosene tractors and was not familiar with diesel tractors, so he should go to the field to take a look. He gently sat up (so as not to wake up Zheng Wangui and Fan Jinbao). But when he had breakfast and approached the beloved tractor, he saw that Zheng Wangui was already busy performing maintenance work on the locomotive.
    When we saw Li Naiwen, he had just returned from the field. He was going to rest for a while so that he could change shifts in the field and let the co-driver Lao Liu go home for a meal. He said: "If I rest less, I can let Lao Liu have a comfortable hot meal. I won't miss the night shift tonight." We asked him, can you bear to work like this day and night without rest? Li Naiwen said with a smile: "It's nothing, I have been exercised, and I often work like this during the busy farming season!"
    Why is this young man, who speaks slowly like a rural girl, so energetic? We slowly understood this from his subsequent conversations.
    He said: "You ask me what I have been thinking about recently. The tense spring plowing is about to begin. What can I think about? I only have one idea: how can I lead my chartered group well, how can I improve work efficiency. I not only think about it, but also discuss it with everyone. We studied the characteristics of the new machine, studied how to rationally use time, and ensure no downtime, so as to save 4% to 7% of the oil specified in the quota. We have listed this in the competition plan.
      "If there is no other idea at all, that's not true. I once had an idea, but it was not recently that I thought of it. I often think: in the old society, I was a pig herder, and the Party trained me to be a tractor driver. What can I do for the country? I am strong, have strength, and am not afraid of hardship. I am willing to be a pioneer in reclamation. When the "93" farm was first built, I participated. This time, I came to the Sandaogang grassland to build the Friendship Farm. I hope that I can personally participate in the construction of the third, fourth, and more farms, and reclaim more wasteland for the motherland.
    "I have talked with some drivers from old farms, and we all have a 'mental preparation': in two or three years, the Friendship Farm will be completed. Our motherland needs such large-scale grain farms not just one, but dozens or hundreds; at that time, as long as the superiors give an order and let us go to that wasteland to build a farm, we will immediately go there!"
    What a beautiful and valuable ideal!
    There are many old tractor drivers like Li Naiwen from various farms here, and their enthusiasm is strong. There are also some 1954 graduates from agricultural universities or agricultural mechanization schools who are entering life for the first year. What are their moods?
    Relief driver Zhao Fengchun was originally a third-year student at the Agricultural Mechanization School attached to the Northeast Agricultural College. When he saw in the newspaper that Soviet youths were enthusiastically signing up to go to the frontier to reclaim wasteland, he admired the patriotic actions of the Soviet youths and yearned for a vibrant and meaningful life on the wasteland. He thought: when can I go to the "Great Northern Wilderness" of the motherland to reclaim wasteland? The news of the construction of the Friendship Farm encouraged him. Now, he has come to the wasteland and is determined to dedicate his youth to the grassland and turn the grassland into the country's granary. Someone once ridiculed him: "What can a high school student do? Why bother going to the wasteland to be a tractor driver!" Zhao Fengchun said: "I didn't come to the wasteland for anything else. Grain is the treasure of the country. It is my wish to increase grain production for the country."
    Zhuang Guangtian, who had just graduated from Beijing Agricultural University, went to the wasteland on the third day of arriving at the Friendship Farm. He repaired roads with the farm workers, swept snow tracks, and went to the fields to pull tree stumps. People simply couldn't tell that he was a recent college graduate. He was willing to use his brain and find ways in his work. When pulling tree stumps, the group of farmers he led saved three or four laborers every day, reduced the transportation capacity of one large truck, and completed the task on time. When carrying out drug seed mixing, they initially failed to meet the work quota, but a few days later they exceeded the quota, and were praised by the head of the branch farm. Zhuang Guangtian wrote a letter to the students of his alma mater telling them his feelings: "I have been assigned to work as a trainee technician, but when I first came to the wasteland, I didn't divide up any majors for the time being. I went to repair roads with my comrades, pulled tree stumps in the fields, and did whatever work there was. We had a really good time..."
    People make spring come to the grassland early, and spring also brings people boundless joyful combat. However, not everyone can enjoy this joy. Youth League member Yan Zhenkun is one of them. Perhaps Yan Zhenkun once had a passion, but he did not have the strong perseverance and hardworking hands. He couldn't stand the wind and frost, couldn't bear the "bitterness," and quietly slipped away. The day after he left, the farm received letters from his wife and his comrades from his original work unit; his relatives and comrades had high hopes for him. The letter said: Comrades were very happy for him to be able to work at the Friendship Farm, and for his promising future. They hoped that he would work hard and study hard. His wife also told him: if there were any difficulties, what she needed to do, he could write to her. However, Yan Zhenkun tarnished the glorious title of Youth League member and failed the expectations of his relatives and comrades. People are thinking: How will Yan Zhenkun meet his relatives and comrades? Let this coward bear the suffering and condemnation he deserves!

    草原初春
    ——国营友谊农场通讯
    姚力文　乔雨舟
    吉普车一出兴隆镇，便驶进了海一样辽阔的草原。晴天，草丛中的冰雪已经融化。附近村屯的农民正在耢地。开冻的大道上，汽车驶过，不时地溅起一片泥浆。“鹅翎”鸟的啼叫声，给人们捎来了春天的信息。
    汽车向着草原的深处继续行进。去年冬天，我们曾随土地整理考察组的同志奔走在这片草地上。那时，野鸡缓步地给偶尔开来的汽车躲开道路；现在，载运着油料、木料和水泥的汽车却不得不嘶叫着绕过装运砂子和石头的胶皮轮大车群。初春，人畜和机器的喧闹声，在呼唤着这长久以来沉睡着的草原。这景象，给草原的开拓者带来了无限的喜悦。坐在吉普车中的王正林副场长，一会儿向新来的苏联专家介绍农场建场的情况，一会儿指着远处的村落和工棚，问翻译小王那是什么地方。每次，小王都笑着回答不上来。还是机灵的司机给小王解了围：“那是‘草房屯’呵！”这回答使大家一怔，很快便都会意地笑了起来。
    草原在变化着。这些不久前还是栖居着獐狍野鸡的荒地上，而今出现了一幢幢的工棚和草房，这就是司机同志所说的“草房屯”。
    我们来到四分场驻地。一幅动人的建设景象呈现在我们面前。在一排低矮的茅屋前，停放着四个带车轮的绿色房屋——宿营车。它的旁边，三座高大的草棚和一个席棚已搭起了。在环绕着茅屋南面几十公尺外的地方，堆放着几尺高的砂子、石头和木料。在北边旷地上，陈列着播种机、圆盘耙和高大的联合收割机等农业机器，以及那引人注目的赭红色和灰色的大油罐。在两台拖拉机前，拖拉机手们正在仔细地擦机器，其他一些拖拉机手已驾驶拖拉机出去进行轻负荷试运转了（顺便进行耢地）。整个“村落”，浸没在拖拉机的轰鸣声里……。
    草原上的春天来得晚。一个月以前，祖国的南方已是莺飞草长了，这里的草地上却还覆盖着一、二尺深的积雪。四分场的第一批七个工作人员，携带着一口小锅、一袋面粉和玉米来到了这里。没有道路，他们铲去雪，修起道路。没有房子，分场周场长亲自带领拖拉机手们到百里外的山中去拉回木材，把房子盖起来。一阵大风把刚搭起的房架子吹倒了，人们就再把它竖立起来。没水吃，他们就每天到十几里外的地方去拉水，并在荒地上打出一口水井来。……任何困难，都不能阻碍工作的进展。
    人们用紧张的劳动迎来了春天。现在，播种机、圆盘耙都已安装好了；巨大的油罐储存了足够春耕春播用的油料；数百吨的种子已运到现场；拌种机在加快速度转动着。每天晚间，人们都可以看到试行运转的拖拉机群放射着耀眼的灯光从田间归来；深夜，拖拉机手们还在热烈地讨论着竞赛条件；工会干部正在为未来的竞赛绘制图表……。这一切都预告着：一个战斗的季节就要到来了。
                    ×　×　×
    我们很想知道：在这紧张战斗的前夕，年轻的拖拉机手、垦荒者们在想些什么，他们的心情如何，他们的希望、愉快是什么。
    我们访问了他们中的许多人。
    四月一日中午，在第九生产队拖拉机手们住的草棚里，大多数拖拉机手下地去了，几个值夜班的拖拉机手，有的在休息，有的在看书。在这里，我们看到了斯大林八十号拖拉机第十九号包车组长李迺文，并同他漫谈起来。“小组里同志们的劲头很不小，”李迺文说。他又谈起了他们组昨天的情况：农具手范金宝摇了一整天拌种机，刚从第五分场临时驻地回来，听说增加了夜班作业，便和另一个农具手郑万贵参加夜班工作。直到深夜一点多钟，他们才从地里回来。李迺文做了一个白班，又连续进行了六、七小时的夜间作业，实在劳累，一觉醒来，已是早晨七点钟了。他想他自己和夜班的同志们需要好好睡一下，但又转念想到，副驾驶刘操杰过去开的是煤油拖拉机，对于柴油拖拉机还不熟练，自己还应该下地照看一下，他便轻轻坐起身来（免得惊醒了郑万贵和范金宝）。但当他吃过早饭，走近那台心爱的拖拉机时，却看见郑万贵已在忙着为机车进行保养工作了。
    我们看见李迺文的时候，他刚从地里回来。他准备稍微休息一会儿好去地里换班，让副驾驶员老刘回家吃饭。他说：“我少休息一会，便能让老刘舒适地吃顿热饭。我也误不了今天晚上值夜班。”我们问他，这样日夜不休息地连着干，能吃得消吗？李迺文笑着说：“没有什么，我经过锻炼了，农忙时，常这样连着干哩！”
    这个说起话来慢吞吞地像个农村姑娘似的小伙子，为什么这样精力充沛呢？从他以后的谈话里，我们才慢慢地明白了这点。
    他说：“你问我最近在想些什么，紧张的春耕就要展开了，我能想些什么呢？我只有一个念头：我怎样领导好我这个包车组，怎样提高工作效率。我不光想，还同大家商量。我们研究了新机器的特性，研究了怎样合理利用时间，保证不停车，这样便能节省定额百分之四至七的油料，我们已把这条列进了竞赛计划里。
      “如果说别的想法一点也没有，那不是真的。我曾有过一个想法，这却不是最近才想到的。我常常想：在旧社会里，我是一个放猪倌，党把我培养成一名拖拉机手。我能给国家做些什么呢？我身体强壮，有力气，不怕吃苦，我愿做一个开荒的尖兵。“九三”农场初建的时候，我参加了。这次来三道岗草原建设友谊农场，我希望还能亲手参加建设第三个、第四个和建设更多的农场，为祖国开垦更多的荒地。
    “我同一些从老农场来的驾驶员谈论过，我们大家都有一个‘思想准备’：两三年后，友谊农场就要建成了，我们祖国需要这样的大型谷物农场不是一个，而是几十个、几百个；那时，只要上级一声号召，让我们到那块荒地上去建场，我们便立即走到那里！”
    多么美好的可贵的理想呵！
    这里有许多从各地农场来的像李迺文这样的老拖拉机手，他们的情绪是旺盛的。这里也有一些第一年走向生活的农业大学或农业机械化学校的一九五四年毕业生。他们的情绪怎样呢？
    换班驾驶员赵凤春原是东北农学院附设农业机械化学校的三年级学生，当他看到报上登着苏联青年踊跃报名到边疆垦荒的时候，他钦佩苏联青年的爱国行动，向往荒地上的有生气有意义的生活。他想：什么时候自己也能到祖国的“北大荒”去垦荒呢？友谊农场建场的消息鼓舞了他。现在，他来到了荒地，决心把青春献给草原，使草原变成国家的粮库。也曾有人向他讥笑过：“一个高中生干个啥不成，何苦去荒地上当名拖拉机手！”赵凤春说：“我不是为了别的才来到荒地。粮食是国家的宝贝，能为国家增产粮食，是我的愿望。”
    从北京农业大学刚毕业的庄广田，来到友谊农场的第三天，便到荒地上了。他和农场工人一起修道路，打扫雪道，到田间去拉树疙瘩。人们简直看不出他是刚出校门的大学生。他工作中肯动脑筋，想办法。拉树疙瘩时，他领导的那个农工小组，每天能节省三、四个人工，减少一辆大车的运输力，还按时完成了任务。在进行药剂拌种时，他们开始达不到工作定额，但几天后便超过了定额，因而受到分场场长的表扬。庄广田把自己的感受写信告诉给母校的同学们说：“我已被分配做见习技术员的工作，但初来荒地，暂时还不分什么专业。我和同志们一起去修路，到田间拉树疙瘩，有什么工作就做什么，我们干的真痛快。……”
    人们使春天提早来到草原，春天也给人们带来了无限的战斗的欢乐。然而，并不是所有的人都能得享这种欢乐。青年团员阎振坤便是一个。也许阎振坤曾有过一股热情，他却没有坚强的毅力和辛勤劳动的双手。他经不起风霜，吃不消“苦”头，悄悄地溜走了。就在他走后的第二天，农场收到他妻子和他原在工作单位同志们的来信；他的亲人和同志都对他抱着很大的希望。信中说：同志们为他能在友谊农场工作，为他的远大前途，深感高兴。希望他努力工作，认真学习。妻子还告诉他：有什么困难，需要她做些什么，可给她去信。阎振坤却沾污了青年团员的光荣称号，也辜负了亲人和同志们的期望。人们在想：阎振坤将怎样去会见他的亲人和同志们呢？让这个懦怯者去承受他应得的苦恼和谴责吧！
