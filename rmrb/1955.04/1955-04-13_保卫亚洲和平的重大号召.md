The Asian Countries Conference concluded successfully on April 10th. The conference achieved significant results visible to all. It adopted sixteen resolutions on various political, cultural, scientific, economic, and social issues. Representatives of various religious communities attending the conference also issued a call for peace. Representatives of people living under different social systems and holding different political and religious beliefs were able to reach such a consensus on such a broad range of issues within a short five days. This demonstrates the immense vitality of the concept of peaceful coexistence and the emerging spirit of the Asian people. This expression of peaceful will should make the Asian people proud.

The resolutions of the Asian Countries Conference are a major call to defend Asian peace. They will greatly promote and encourage the Asian people's struggle for peace, independence, and freedom. It will play a significant role in further strengthening the friendship and solidarity among the people of Asian countries, promoting the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, opposing international war, and easing tensions in the Far East. These resolutions prove that this conference is a great peaceful march of the Asian people. The Chinese people fully support these resolutions and warmly congratulate the success of the Asian Countries Conference.

The American propaganda machine has engaged in all kinds of shameless slanders and provocations against the Asian Countries Conference, desperately fabricating the lie of so-called "Communist control" of the conference. They also attempted to pit this peaceful gathering of the Asian people against the Asian-African Conference, which is warmly supported by the people of Asia and Africa. The purpose of all these propaganda tricks is to obstruct the friendship and unity of the Asian people, belittle the significance and role of the Asian Countries Conference, and sabotage this conference. However, the enthusiastic support of the Asian countries for the convening of the Asian Countries Conference led to positive results. The people of India made an important contribution, initiating the conference and presiding over the international preparations. Indian President Prasad and Prime Minister Nehru received the heads of delegations from various countries. At the same time, the Asian Countries Conference was also supported by peace-loving countries and people in Europe. The achievements of the Asian Countries Conference have caused the American aggressive bloc's conspiracies of provocation and sabotage to suffer a shameful defeat.

The Asian Countries Conference's resolution on the Five Principles is one of the most significant achievements of the conference. It reflects the common aspiration of the peace-loving people of Asia and the world to universally respect and support the Five Principles. The resolution calls on the governments of all Asian and world countries to agree to use these principles as the basis for their relations with all countries. In Asia, the implementation of these principles has brought about an unprecedentedly active situation. Not only has the friendly relationship between China and India, and China and Burma, the initiators of these five principles, been developing, but the relationship between other Asian countries is also improving; an atmosphere of understanding and mutual trust is growing. Recently, India and Egypt concluded a treaty of friendship. A delegation from the Cambodian government visited India and issued a joint communiqué in favor of the Five Principles. After Indian Prime Minister Nehru visited the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, was also invited to visit India, and issued a joint communiqué with Indian Prime Minister Nehru. This kind of friendly visit, and the friendly relations established and expanded on the basis of the Five Principles, are conducive to expanding the area of ​​peace and maintaining peace in Asia and the world.

However, the American aggressive bloc is bent on creating division and antagonism in Asia in order to escalate tensions and prepare for new wars. Therefore, they hate peaceful coexistence and openly denounce peaceful coexistence as "a cunning new term." It arrogantly wants to make "Asians fight Asians" and "Europeans fight Europeans." The military blocs organized by the United States are war tools that attempt to undermine peaceful coexistence, and are incompatible with the concept of peaceful coexistence. Indian Prime Minister Nehru rightly pointed out: "The Manila Treaty and the Bangkok Conference have overturned any previous concepts of peace or security in that region. The entire concept of the Geneva Conference is coexistence." At the same time, in order to cobble together a Middle East aggressive bloc, the United States also instigated the creation of the Turkey-Iraq Treaty and attempted to coerce other Near East and Middle East countries to participate. These activities of the United States have also created division and antagonism in this region, and exacerbated tensions in the Middle East. The Asian Countries Conference condemned these activities and demanded the withdrawal and removal of all foreign troops and bases from Asian lands. All of this shows that the 1.4 billion Asian people are determined to uphold the Five Principles and oppose war conspiracies. This determination is a powerful force for defending peace and promoting international cooperation.

The Asian Countries Conference made resolutions resolutely opposing colonialism that still exists in Asia, and resolutely opposing foreign interference in the internal affairs of other countries. The resolution pointed out that Goa in India, West Irian in Indonesia, and the Okinawa Islands in Japan, which are currently under foreign occupation, must be returned to their rightful owners; the people of Malaya should obtain complete freedom. At the same time, the conference supported the struggle of the people of Arab and North African countries for independence and freedom, opposed racial discrimination, and justly and reasonably advocated that Japan must be given a completely equal status in international exchanges.

The most serious aggressive act currently threatening peace in Asia and the world is the United States' unscrupulous occupation of China's territory of Taiwan, interference in China's internal affairs, and war provocations against the Chinese people. The United States is stepping up new military deployments in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, and clamoring to send more American troops to Taiwan. American warmongers such as Kearney, Nolan, and Bridges even openly advocate attacking the Chinese mainland. At the same time, the United States is also attempting to win over Britain and some Commonwealth countries to guarantee its occupation of Taiwan, vainly attempting to create "two Chinas." This intensified war provocation activity by the United States has been met with increasingly strong condemnation from people of all countries, and has aroused increasing unease and dissatisfaction within the United States.

The Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan, which is our sacred task of defending the motherland, defending sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Our liberation of Taiwan is also for the sake of peace in Asia and the world. As long as the United States withdraws all its armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, the tense situation in the Far East will be eased. Under this prerequisite, it is not impossible for the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan peacefully. The resolution of the Asian Countries Conference advocates that Taiwan belongs to China, American troops must withdraw from the Taiwan region, and it also advocates holding an international conference to peacefully resolve the Taiwan issue, which is completely correct. The Chinese people fully support this proposition.

Other important Asian issues closely related to the Asian people are the Korean issue and the Indochina issue. The reason why these issues have become serious and complicated is also because the United States has obstructed the democratic reunification of Korea, interfered in the internal affairs of Indochina, and conspired to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement and the Geneva Accords. We firmly support the resolution of the Asian Countries Conference, believing that the Korean Armistice Agreement must be fully implemented, and an international political conference to peacefully resolve the Korean issue must be convened as soon as possible. American interference in the internal affairs of Indochina must also be stopped, and the countries concerned must ensure the strict implementation of the Geneva Accords. This is the firm position of the Asian people, and it is the unanimous demand of peace-loving countries and people all over the world.

The Asian people support the resolutions of the Asian Countries Conference, resolutely oppose preparations for atomic war, demand the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and advocate the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. The signature campaign of the Asian people against the use of atomic weapons is developing vigorously throughout Asia. More than 400 million people in China and more than 23 million people in Japan have signed. This is a manifestation of the Asian people's firm will to oppose war and defend peace. The Asian Countries Conference recommended that all of Asia commemorate August 6, 1955, the tenth anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima, Japan. This is a very meaningful suggestion.

The Asian Countries Conference expressed its support for the upcoming Asian-African Conference and hoped that the Asian-African Conference would achieve great success. This is entirely in line with the common aspirations of the Asian people. However, the American aggressive bloc is extremely hostile to this conference. The United States even directed the Kuomintang traitorous group's secret agents to resort to despicable means, creating an airplane crash crime to murder members of our delegation to the Asian-African Conference. This most blatantly shows that the American aggressive bloc does not hesitate to adopt despicable means to sabotage the Asian-African Conference. The Chinese people express infinite anger at this despicable crime of the United States. The American aggressive bloc must not escape its serious responsibility for this crime.

The resolutions of the Asian Countries Conference on cultural, scientific, economic, and social issues reflect the universal and urgent aspirations of the Asian people. Today, although the United States and other colonial countries are still trying their best to economically control Asia and hang iron curtains between the people of Asian countries, Asian countries are in a position to continuously expand economic cooperation and cultural exchanges, and improve the material and cultural lives of the Asian people, on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual assistance and cooperation. The joint efforts of the people of Asian countries in this regard will produce important results.

The Chinese people have always unremittingly pursued a peaceful foreign policy. For more than five years, our ties with the people of Asia and the world have become increasingly close. Our country has also made great progress in developing diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations with Asian and world countries. Starting from this consistent position of safeguarding world peace and promoting international cooperation, the Chinese people will work together with the people of Asian countries to realize the resolutions of the Asian Countries Conference.

The Asian Countries Conference marks a new and significant development in the great cause of the Asian people in defending peace. The people of Asian countries will surely make further efforts, on the basis of the achievements of this conference, to strengthen the friendship and unity among the Asian people, and more resolutely and powerfully assume the responsibility of defending peace in Asia and the world.

### 保卫亚洲和平的重大号召

    保卫亚洲和平的重大号召
    亚洲国家会议已于四月十日圆满结束。会议取得了人所共见的重大成果。它对各项政治问题、文化、科学、经济、社会等问题通过了十六个决议。出席会议的各国宗教界代表还发表了一个呼吁和平书。生活在不同的社会制度之下，具有不同的政治和宗教信仰的人民的代表们，能够在短短五天之内，就这样广泛的问题取得这样一致的意见，这表现了和平共处这个概念的磅礴的生命力，表现了亚洲人民的新兴气概，这种和平意志的表现应该使亚洲人民感到自豪。
    亚洲国家会议的决议是保卫亚洲和平的重大号召。它将大大地推动和鼓舞亚洲人民争取和平、独立、自由的斗争。它对于进一步加强亚洲各国人民之间的友好、团结，对于推行和平共处的五项原则，反对国际战争，缓和远东紧张局势，将会发生重大的作用。这些决议证明这次会议是亚洲各国人民伟大的和平进军。中国人民完全支持会议的这些决议，热烈庆贺亚洲国家会议的成功。
    美国宣传机关对亚洲国家会议进行了种种无耻的诽谤和挑拨，竭力捏造所谓“共产党控制”会议的谎言。它们还企图把亚洲人民这次的和平集会同亚非人民热烈支持的亚非会议对立起来。这一切宣传诡计的目的，是要阻挠亚洲人民的友好和团结，贬低亚洲国家会议的意义和作用，并破坏这个会议。但是，亚洲各国人民热烈支持亚洲国家会议的召开，使会议取得了积极的结果。在这里，印度人民作出了重要的贡献，他们发起召开这次会议，主持了会议的国际筹备工作。印度总统普拉沙德和总理尼赫鲁接见了各国代表团团长。同时，亚洲国家会议还得到了欧洲爱好和平的国家和人民的支持。亚洲国家会议取得的成就，使美国侵略集团的挑拨和破坏阴谋遭到了可耻的失败。
    亚洲国家会议关于五项原则的决议，是会议的一项最重大的成就。它反映了亚洲和世界爱好和平人民普遍推崇和支持五项原则的共同愿望。决议要求所有亚洲和世界各国的政府同意把这些原则作为它们同所有国家的关系的基础。在亚洲，这些原则的推行，已使亚洲出现了前所未见的活跃的局面。不仅这五项原则的倡导者中印、中缅之间的友好关系日益发展，其他亚洲国家间的关系也在增进；谅解和互信的气氛正在增长。最近，印度和埃及缔结了友好条约。柬埔寨政府代表团曾访问印度发表了赞成五项原则的会谈公报。印度总理尼赫鲁访问越南民主共和国后，越南民主共和国副总理兼外长范文同也应邀访问印度，同印度总理尼赫鲁发表了联合公报。这种友好访问，和在五项原则基础上建立和扩大的友好关系，有利于扩大和平地区，维护亚洲和世界的和平。
    但是，美国侵略集团一心要制造亚洲的分裂和对立，以便加剧紧张局势，准备新的战争，因而它们仇视和平共处，竟公然斥责和平共处为“狡诈的新字眼”。它狂妄地要使“亚洲人打亚洲人”，使“欧洲人打欧洲人”。美国组织的军事集团，就是企图破坏和平共处的战争工具，它同和平共处的概念是不相容的。印度总理尼赫鲁正确地指出：“马尼拉条约和曼谷会议已经推翻了先前在那个地区存在的任何和平观念，或任何安全概念。日内瓦会议的整个概念是共处。”同时，美国为了拼凑中东侵略集团，还策动制造了土耳其—伊拉克条约，并企图胁迫其他近东、中东国家参加。美国的这些活动，也造成了这一地区的分裂和对立，加剧了中东的紧张局势。亚洲国家会议谴责了这些活动，要求从亚洲的土地上撤退和撤除一切外国军队和基地。所有这一切都说明十四亿亚洲人民决心维护五项原则，反对战争阴谋。这种决心是保卫和平和促进国际合作的强大力量。
    亚洲国家会议作出决议，坚决反对在亚洲仍然存在着的殖民主义，坚决反对外国干涉其他国家内政。决议指出，现在外国占领下的印度的果阿、印度尼西亚的西伊里安和日本的冲绳群岛必须归还本主；马来亚人民应该得到完全的自由。同时，会议支持阿拉伯和北非各国人民争取独立自由的斗争，反对种族歧视，并公正地合理地主张必须给日本以在国际的往来中完全平等的地位。
    目前最严重地威胁亚洲和世界和平的侵略行为，是美国肆无忌惮地侵占中国领土台湾、干涉中国内政，对中国人民进行战争挑衅。美国正在台湾和台湾海峡加紧进行新的军事部署，扬言要向台湾增派美国军队。美国好战分子卡涅、诺兰和布里奇斯之流甚至公开鼓吹进攻中国大陆。同时，美国还企图拉拢英国和某些英联邦国家来保证它侵占台湾，妄想借此制造“两个中国”。美国这种变本加厉的战争挑衅活动，受到了各国人民越来越强烈的指责，并在美国国内引起了日益不安和不满。
    中国人民坚决要解放台湾，这是我们保卫祖国、保卫主权和领土完整的神圣任务。我们解放台湾，同时也是为了亚洲和世界的和平。只要美国从台湾和台湾海峡撤走一切武装力量，远东紧张局势就会缓和。在这种先决条件之下，中国人民和平解放台湾也不是不可能的。亚洲国家会议的决议主张台湾属于中国，美国军队必须从台湾地区撤走，同时还主张召开国际会议来和平解决台湾问题，这是完全正确的。中国人民全力支持这种主张。
    亚洲人民所密切关心的其他重要的亚洲问题，是朝鲜问题和印度支那问题。这些问题所以变得严重和复杂化也是由于美国阻挠朝鲜的民主统一，干涉印度支那内政，阴谋破坏朝鲜停战协定和日内瓦协议的结果。我们坚决支持亚洲国家会议的决议，认为朝鲜停战协定必须彻底实施，和平解决朝鲜问题的国际政治会议必须尽速召开。美国对印度支那内政的干涉也必须停止，有关国家必须保证日内瓦协议的严格执行。这是亚洲人民的坚决立场，并且是全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的一致要求。
    亚洲人民支持亚洲国家会议的决议，坚决反对准备原子战争，要求禁止原子武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器，主张把原子能用于和平用途。亚洲人民反对使用原子武器的签名运动，正在全亚洲各地蓬勃展开，中国人民签名的有四亿多人，日本有二千三百多万人签了名。这是亚洲人民反对战争、保卫和平的坚强意志的表现。亚洲国家会议建议全亚洲纪念一九五五年八月六日即日本广岛被炸十周年。这是一个很有意义的建议。
    亚洲国家会议表示支持即将举行的亚非会议，并希望亚非会议取得巨大的成就，这是完全符合亚洲人民的共同愿望的。但美国侵略集团却极端仇视这个会议。美国竟指使蒋介石卖国集团的特务，下了卑鄙的毒手，制造了飞机失事罪行来谋害我国出席亚非会议代表团的人员。这就最露骨地表明，美国侵略集团不惜采取人所不齿的手段来破坏亚非会议。中国人民对于美国的这种卑鄙罪行表示无限的愤怒。美国侵略集团决不能逃脱它对于这种罪行的严重责任。
    亚洲国家会议关于文化、科学、经济和社会问题的决议，反映了亚洲人民普遍的迫切的愿望。今天，尽管美国和其他殖民国家仍然在竭力从经济上控制亚洲，并在亚洲各国人民之间挂下铁幕，但是亚洲国家已有条件在平等互利和互助合作的基础上不断扩大经济合作和文化交流、提高亚洲人民的物质和文化生活，亚洲各国人民在这方面的共同努力，将会产生重要的结果。
    中国人民始终不懈地奉行和平的外交政策。五年多以来，我们同亚洲和世界各国人民之间的联系，日益密切。我国在同亚洲和世界各国发展外交、经济和文化关系方面，也取得了很大的进展。从这个维护世界和平和促进国际合作的一贯立场出发，中国人民将同亚洲各国人民一起，为实现亚洲国家会议的决议而努力。
    亚洲国家会议标志着亚洲人民保卫和平的伟大事业有了新的、重大的发展。亚洲各国人民一定会进一步努力，在这个会议的成就的基础上，加强亚洲人民之间的友好和团结，更坚决更有力地把保卫亚洲及世界和平的责任担当起来。
