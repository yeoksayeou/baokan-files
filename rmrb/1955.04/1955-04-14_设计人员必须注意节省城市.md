As Vice President of the Urban Design Institute of the Construction Bureau, Li Yinpeng writes:

Saving is one of the important methods for socialist accumulation of funds. When carrying out architectural engineering design, saving should be placed in a very important position. In the communiqué issued by the State Statistical Bureau, the floor area of houses completed with state investment in 1953 totaled more than 30 million square meters. If the cost per square meter is calculated at 100 yuan (the actual figure is higher than this), saving only 5% of the cost would save 150 million yuan in one year. Based on past experience, taking the 1953 quota as a base, if designers can pay attention to saving, this can be completely achieved.

This year, we designed 330,000 square meters of mixed-structure housing. By learning from the Soviet Union's advanced "plasticity" theory and using it to calculate floor slabs, we saved 1.6 million yuan compared to using the British and American "elasticity" theory. This is equivalent to just over 5.3% of the total cost. For example, in the design of some residential buildings, using "brick arches" instead of "roof frames" alone saved 960,000 yuan on 790,000 square meters of building area. More importantly, it saved 22,900 cubic meters of wood. Because the designers were able to be meticulous, changing the "iron shims" of the "truss" from the usual 6 mm to 3 mm (thickness) saved 20 tons of iron plate, worth 24,000 yuan. For another example, the recent trial use of "pig iron low-pressure boilers" and "single-pipe sequential forced circulation hot water heating" in the office building of the Public Building Design Institute can reduce the cost of heating equipment per square meter of building (based on the 1954 North China Construction Engineering Bureau budget quota) by 8 yuan. If this method is widely adopted throughout the country for the heating equipment of 10 million square meters of buildings, it can save 80 million yuan in funds each year, and also save about 90,000 tons of coal. The state can also reduce heating expenses by about 22.5 million yuan per year, and save three-quarters of the water consumption compared to steam heating. If the wrought iron water pipes with an inner diameter of more than 75 mm used for heating equipment are replaced with pig iron pipes, and the steel plate (Lancashire) boilers used for heating are replaced with pig iron boilers, 380,000 tons of steel can be saved each year (based on 10 million square meters), reducing the cost of heating equipment by 50%. These methods are all feasible. For example, in the 5,000 square meter building of Project 5201, the original design used steam heating, which required three boilers. In order to save space, the boiler room was built too small to install three boilers. Later, it was changed to "cast iron boiler hot water heating," which only used two cast iron boilers. This not only solved the problem of the small boiler room but also saved about a quarter of the cost.

In the past, although we paid attention to saving in design and achieved certain results, waste in design work is still very serious. For example, in the layout of water supply and drainage pipes and heating pipes, due to the lack of an overall concept and poor coordination, there are many pipelines that take detours. For example, in the heating design of more than 17,000 radiators in the Marx-Lenin Academy, heat is supplied in two parts, each with six boilers, but the distribution of radiators is more than 17,000 in one place and only more than 6,000 in another. As a result, there is insufficient steam in one place and two boilers and hundreds of meters of iron pipes are wasted in the other. For another example, in the design of a lubricating oil heating system, five coils in each oil tank can meet the heating requirements. However, the designer used American design reference data and used 17 coils with a diameter of three-quarters of an inch, totaling 16.5 meters, and added a safety factor of 20% in addition to the number of coils that should be checked according to the table, which excessively expanded the heat transfer area. After installation, the test showed that the upper half of the tank was hot, but the lower half was not. After this problem occurred, the original designer asked to remove the "steam separators" from each tank, installed a general "steam separator" on the return pipe, and removed ten coils from the tank, but the heat consumption was still too high, causing the boiler to be overloaded. Later, another engineer recalculated and found that only five coils were enough, plus other improvements. It saved materials compared to the original design and was also applicable. If the original design were to be fully installed, it would waste more than 24,000 yuan more than the revised design, and it would not be applicable. It has now been revised and is usable, but due to several removals and modifications, the loss of labor and material costs is about 6,000 yuan (because it was not fully installed according to the original design). As for the waste in structure, foundation, and architectural decoration, it is too numerous to mention. For example, in general housing construction, fair-faced brick walls are sufficient, but some designers want to add many unnecessary and unattractive plastering and sculptures. Like our recently built office building, because the designer wanted to express the so-called "national form," he insisted on adding dougong decorations under the eaves of each room on the flat roof, which did not play a structural load-bearing role, nor was it beautiful, but it wasted cement and steel bars. For another example, in the design of an auditorium for 1,000 people, the designer only designed the foundation according to the maximum load-bearing capacity, regardless of the height and number of floors of the wall, and regardless of the size of the room, and adopted the largest and widest foundation. There are also some designers who want to cover a large area of ​​buildings with old palace-style roofs, calling them "national forms," which consumes a lot of wood and adds ancient-style colored paintings, increasing the cost per square meter.

From the above situation, it is completely possible for designers to establish a clear economic accounting perspective, strive to save, and reduce the construction cost per square meter. Therefore, every designer must deeply understand the important meaning of saving, especially paying attention to saving wood and metal materials. The production of wood is limited by the age of the tree. Generally, miscellaneous wood (such as poplar and willow) takes 20 to 30 years to become timber, and pine and cypress wood takes 100 years. As for metal materials such as steel, copper, and aluminum, the output in our country is still low, and cement is also in short supply. Therefore, paying attention to saving these materials today is of particular importance. Of course, this does not mean that things that can be produced in large quantities in our country can be wasted. However, some designers often ignore this point. This requires all designers to compare various plans during design, to be meticulous, to pay attention to overall savings, and to fight against waste, mobilize the masses, and carry out a savings campaign in design, so that every design meets the principles of suitability, economy, and beauty, and strives to save more funds and materials for the country.

    设计人员必须注意节省城市
    建设总局城市设计院副院长　李荫蓬
    节约是社会主义积累资金的重要方法之一。进行建筑工程设计时，应该把节约放在十分重要的地位。在国家统计局所发表的公报中，一九五三年由国家投资所完成的房屋建筑面积共计三千万平方公尺以上。如以每平方公尺造价一百元计（事实要比这个数字高），只要节省百分之五的造价，一年中就可节约一亿五千万元。根据过去的经验，以一九五三年的定额作基数，如果设计人员能重视节约，是完全可以做到这一点的。
    我们今年设计了三十三万平方公尺混合结构房屋建筑，由于学习了苏联先进的“塑性”理论经验，用“塑性”理论计算楼板，就比用英、美“弹性”理论计算时节省了一百六十万元，等于总造价的百分之五点三强。例如在一部分住宅房屋设计中，只是用“砖拱”代“房架”一项，在七十九万平方公尺建筑面积上即节省了九十六万元。更重要的是节省了二万二千九百立方公尺木材。由于设计人员能精打细算，将“柁架”的“铁垫板”由一般的六公厘改为三公厘（厚度），就节省二十公吨铁板，价值二万四千元。又如，最近在公用建筑设计院办公楼内，试用“生铁低压锅炉”和“单管顺序强制循环热水供暖法”，可使每平方公尺建筑（以一九五四年前华北建筑工程局概算定额为基数）内供暖设备的造价降低八元。如全国以一千万平方公尺建筑房屋的供暖设备计，普遍采用这种方法，每年可节省资金八千万元，还可以节约煤炭约九万公吨，国家每年还可少支出烤火费二千二百五十万元左右，并可比蒸汽供暖节省耗水量的四分之三。如果再将供暖设备用的七十五公厘以上内径的熟铁输水管改用生铁管，加热用的钢板（兰克夏）锅炉改用生铁锅炉，每年（以一千万平方公尺计）就可节约钢材三十八万公吨，降低供暖设备造价百分之五十。这些方法都是切实可行的。如在五二零一工程的五千平方公尺建筑中，原设计用蒸汽供暖，需要三个锅炉，为节省面积竟将锅炉房盖小了，无法安装三个锅炉，后来改变用“铸铁锅炉热水供暖法”，只用了二个铸铁锅炉，不但解决了锅炉房小的问题，还节省了约四分之一的造价。
    过去，我们在设计方面虽曾注意了节约，也获得了一定的成绩，但是在设计工作中的浪费现象还是很严重的。譬如在上下水的管道和暖汽的管道布置上，由于缺乏整体观念，互相配合不好，走弯路的管线是很多的。如在马克思列宁学院一万七千余个散热片的供暖设计中，分两部供热，每部有六部锅炉，而散热片的分配却是一处一万七千余片，一处只六千余片。结果是一处汽量不足，一处浪费了二部锅炉和数百公尺的铁管。又如在一个润滑油加温的设计中，每个油罐内用五圈盘管即可达到加温的要求，由于设计人采用了美国的设计参考数据，竟用四分之三英吋直径的盘管十七圈，计十六点五公尺，并在按表查出应需盘管数外，又加百分之二十的安全系数，这样就过分扩大了传热面积。安装后经试验是上半罐热，下半罐不热。发生这个问题后，原设计人便叫将每个罐的“隔汽具”去掉，在回水管上装了一个总的“隔汽具”，又将罐内的盘管去掉十圈，但耗热量仍然过大，造成锅炉超负荷的现象。后经另一位工程师重新计算，只需五圈盘管就够用了，加以其他方面的改进。比原设计节省了材料，还适用。如要按原设计全部安装完毕，会比改后的设计浪费二万四千余元，还不适用。现已经修改可用了，但因数次的拆卸修改，损失的工料费约六千元（因未按原设计全部安装）。至于在结构和基础及建筑装饰上的浪费情形，就不胜枚举了。如在一般的房屋建筑中，用清水墙是可以的，但有一些设计人员却要另加上许多不必要而又不美观的粉刷和雕塑。像我们最近建成的办公楼，由于设计人为了要表现所谓“民族形式”，硬在平顶的每间房檐下加上斗拱的装饰，既不起结构的承重作用，又不美观，却浪费了水泥和钢筋。又如在一个一千人的礼堂设计中，设计者只是按最大承重量设计基础，不管墙的高低层数，也不管房间大小，一律采用最大最宽的基础。还有一些设计人员，要在大面积的房屋建筑上，全部盖上旧的宫殿式大屋顶，称之为“民族形式”，耗费了很多的木料，并加以古式的彩画，提高了每平方公尺的造价。
    由上述的情况来看，只要设计人员树立明确的经济核算观点，努力节约，降低每平方公尺的建筑造价是完全可能的。因此，每个设计人员一定要深刻地体会节约的重要意义，特别是注意节省木材和金属材料。木材的生产受着树龄的限制，一般杂木（杨柳等木）要经二、三十年才能成材，松柏木就要百年。至于钢、铜、铝等金属材料，目前在我国的产量还少，水泥也是供不应求。因之今天注意这些材料的节约，是有特别重要意义的。当然这并不是说我国能大量生产的东西就可浪费了。但是，往往有些设计人员忽略了这点。这就要求所有的设计人员在设计时，要进行各种方案的比较，要精打细算，注意全面的节约，并向浪费的现象进行斗争，发动群众，开展设计中的节约运动，使每一个设计都符合适用、经济、美观的原则，为国家节约更多的资财而努力。
