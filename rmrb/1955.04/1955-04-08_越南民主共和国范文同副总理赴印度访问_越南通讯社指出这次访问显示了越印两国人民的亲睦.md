Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 7th:  Vice Premier and Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, and his entourage, left Hanoi by plane this morning for Delhi at the invitation of the Indian government.

The Vietnam News Agency, commenting on the visit of Vice Premier and Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, to India, stated that the people of Vietnam had consistently received the approval and support of the people of India during their past patriotic wars. During the Geneva Conference, India actively promoted the success of the conference. In the current work of implementing the Geneva Armistice Agreement, India is serving as the chairman of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam, and it has made and is making many efforts and contributions to complete its mission. In October last year, Prime Minister Nehru visited the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and held talks with President Ho Chi Minh. These are favorable foundations for establishing and promoting friendly relations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of India based on the Five Principles proposed in the joint declarations of China and India and China and Burma.

The commentary further said that Pham Van Dong's visit to India demonstrates the close friendship between the people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the people of the Republic of India. This visit will make a significant contribution to establishing and expanding relations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of India in all aspects, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
