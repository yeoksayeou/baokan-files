Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, April 9th, TASS: The "Bangkok Post" reported that due to the Burmese government forces launching battles in March aimed at eliminating the Kuomintang bandit troops within Burma, all known supply bases of the Kuomintang bandit troops have been occupied or besieged. In some places, the Kuomintang bandit troops, who have been pushed close to the Thai border, are fleeing. Chiang Kai-shek's officers in the rear are forcing soldiers to defend strongholds under attack by the Burmese army. It is reported that some Kuomintang bandit soldiers have been found tied to cannons. Food, opium, and water were placed next to these bandit soldiers.

According to newspaper reports, aircraft of "unknown nationality" have appeared on the battlefield. "Siam Masses Daily" stated that aircraft "from afar" are dropping weapons and ammunition to Chiang Kai-shek elements near the Thai border.
