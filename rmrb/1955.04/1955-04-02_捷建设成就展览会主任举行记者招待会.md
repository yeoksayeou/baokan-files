Xinhua News Agency, April 1st – Comrade Pok, Director of the Czechoslovak Ten-Year Socialist Construction Achievement Exhibition, held a press conference on the afternoon of the 1st to introduce the preparations for the exhibition to reporters in the capital.

Pok said: This exhibition is the largest exhibition held by Czechoslovakia abroad, with an exhibition area of 18,000 square meters. The exhibits shipped from Czechoslovakia to China used 150 freight cars with a load of 50 tons. Although loading and unloading work sometimes had to be carried out in severe cold, thanks to the efforts of Soviet and Chinese railway workers, all exhibits were transported to China in four weeks after a journey of 12,000 kilometers.

Pok also said: Czechoslovakia's machinery industry has developed greatly in the ten years since liberation. The output of the machinery industry in 1954 has reached twice the highest pre-war level. Most of the exhibits are products of the machinery industry. Installation work is now in full swing.

Pok introduced the scale and content of the exhibits to the reporters and guided them to visit the exhibits in various pavilions.

    新华社一日讯　捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会主任波克在一日下午举行记者招待会，向首都记者介绍展览会的筹备情况。
    波克说：这次展览会是捷克斯洛伐克在国外举行的规模最大的展览会，展出的面积有一万八千平方公尺。从捷克斯洛伐克运来中国的展品使用了载重五十吨的车皮一百五十辆。虽然有时要在严寒中进行装卸工作，但由于苏联和中国铁路员工的努力，全部展品在四周内经过一万二千公里的旅程运到了中国。
    波克又说：捷克斯洛伐克的机械工业在解放后十年来已有很大发展，机械工业在一九五四年的产量已达到战前最高水平的两倍。这次展出的大部都是机械工业的产品。现在安装工作正在紧张地进行。
    波克向记者们介绍了展览会的规模和展品的内容，并引导参观了展览会各馆的展品。
