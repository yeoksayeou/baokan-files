    Deeply Grateful for the Nurturing and Leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao
    --Excerpts from Zhou Xinfang's Reply at the 50th Anniversary Celebration of Mei Lanfang and Zhou Xinfang's Stage Life
    Zhou Xinfang
    With boundless gratitude and excitement, I am participating in this grand and solemn commemorative meeting. Such a commemorative meeting is unprecedented in the history of Chinese drama. Only under the brilliant light of the Party and the guidance of Chairman Mao's correct literary and artistic policy can we drama workers receive this honor.
    Thinking back to the days when I was learning the art from a teacher in my childhood, I recall some of my learning experiences. At that time, although our teachers had a solid professional foundation and rich stage experience, they lacked theoretical guidance, and their achievements were all groped out in the dark. Therefore, they could do it, but they couldn't explain it. When faced with some difficult topics, they often answered us with "it can only be understood implicitly, not expressed in words." They said, "The master leads you in, but the cultivation is up to you," and the only requirement for us apprentices was "study hard and practice diligently," so that after we had a certain foundation, we could understand and improve ourselves.
    After going on stage to perform, I felt that I was young, had a poor foundation, and had a low level of education. In addition to humbly seeking advice from some senior teachers in person, I also took time to watch the performances of many famous actors at that time, and I did not give up the opportunity to watch and learn good plays of Xiaosheng, Jing, Dan, and Chou roles other than my own specialty (old male, bearded old male). By absorbing from many aspects, after my own deliberation, assimilation, and selection, combined with my own conditions, and through continuous improvement in stage practice, my professional level gradually improved imperceptibly; if I had been arrogant, complacent, and despised others at that time, I am afraid that my stage life would have been destroyed long ago.
    After I had laid a preliminary foundation in my profession and gradually expanded the scope of my repertoire, I received new enlightenment. This enlightenment came from two aspects: on the one hand, I felt that each character in each play had its own characteristics in terms of personality, background, and temperament, so it should be expressed in different ways. If I mechanically imitated the actions and singing of some senior teachers and applied them rigidly to another play, it would be out of place. On the other hand, after watching the performances of two or three famous old performers, I found that they each had their own performance styles and strengths when performing the same play, and I realized that in performing arts, it is permissible to create by combining personal conditions and strengths. This is how I began to build up my own confidence and determination to create new artistic images. My only requirement at that time was: not only must it be reasonable and logical, but the characters must be vivid and real, so that the audience would be deeply infected; it was not until today that I understood that these requirements are the basic conditions of realism in performing arts.
    Looking back, I feel that my own process of reforming stage performance art is also a difficult and complex struggle. This process is not a smooth development without obstacles. Although it has been supported and welcomed by the people, it has also encountered opposition from many conservatives, and has been subjected to satire in writing and ridicule in speech for a long time.
    In the past, whether in my childhood, youth, or middle age, the agents of feudalism and imperialism -- bureaucrats, landlords, and comprador class -- were all enticing us drama workers to take the path of depravity. If we accidentally lost our footing, we would immediately destroy ourselves; driven by my conscience and justice, I never gave up on myself, became their prisoner, or succumbed to their evil forces; in the years of national suffering, Mr. Mei did not perform for eight years, and I also used "Emperor Huizong and Emperor Qinzong" to fight them. Personal strength is very weak. My situation at that time was like sailing a small boat through the long night, through the stormy waves, from this shore to the other shore, with the danger of being destroyed at any time.
    When we greeted the national liberation with a hundredfold excitement, although we had passed our middle age, after breathing the air of the new era, we felt that we were young again. In the past six years, under the correct leadership of the Party and the People's Government, and under the guidance of Chairman Mao's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" for drama reform, our political and professional levels of drama workers have been improved, and our drama career has a new life and is developing vigorously. Let us once again thank the great Chinese Communist Party and our most beloved Chairman Mao.
　　Finally, please allow me to talk about my personal experience and thoughts on today's commemorative meeting:
    Although Mr. Mei and I have made a little contribution to the drama cause in the past 50 years of stage life, we feel that our contribution is not very commensurate with such a high honor to receive this honor at such a grand commemorative meeting today; however, from another perspective, today's commemorative meeting also fully demonstrates the respect and love of the country and the people for our drama workers. Our country and people hope to produce more drama artists with high accomplishment and thousands upon thousands of young artists to meet the growing demands of the broad masses of people for cultural life. Undoubtedly, today's commemorative meeting will play an inspiring role for the broad masses of literary and art workers.
    Comrades of drama workers across the country, let us all study hard and strive to create new artistic works! Let us all realize art reform through unremitting artistic practice! Even if we only make a little contribution to the people, the people will never forget us. Although Mr. Mei and I are both 60 years old, our spirit will never grow old. We are willing to join hands with comrades of drama workers across the country to advance side by side and fight to the end for the great socialist construction cause of the motherland.

    衷心感谢党和毛主席的培养和领导
    ——在梅兰芳周信芳舞台生活五十年纪念会上的答词摘要
    周信芳
    我以无比感激和兴奋的心情，来参加这一个隆重庄严的纪念大会。这样一个纪念会，在我们中国戏剧史上，还是破天荒的第一次。只有在党的光辉照耀下，在毛主席正确的文艺方针指导下，我们戏曲工作者才有可能接受到这一份荣誉。
    想起幼年从师习艺时代，我想起自己学习的一些情况。那时，我们的老师虽都有深厚的业务基础和丰富的舞台经验，但都缺乏理论指导，他们的成就也都是从暗中摸索得来的，因此，他们能做得出，却讲不出。面临着一些疑难的课题的时候，他们就经常用“只可意会，不可言传”来答复我们。他们说：“师傅领进门，修行在个人”，对我们艺徒的唯一要求是：“苦学苦练”，让我们具备了一定基础以后，自己去体会，自己去提高。
    登台演出以后，我自己感觉到年纪轻、基础差、文化程度又不高，除了虚心地向一些前辈先生们当面请益以外，更抽出一部分时间去观摩当时许多已经成名演员们的戏，甚至对自己应工（老生、靠把老生）以外的小生、净、旦、丑角的好戏，都没有放弃观摩学习的机会。由于向多方面的吸收，经过自己琢磨、融化、选择，结合了自己的条件，通过舞台实践的不断进修，自己的业务水平，才在不知不觉中逐步提高起来；如果当时骄傲自满、目空一切地蔑视别人，恐怕自己的舞台生活早就毁灭了。
    我在业务上已经奠定了初步基础并且逐渐扩大了上演剧目的范围以后，又受到了新的启发。这种启发是从两方面来的：一方面，是感觉到各个剧目中的每一个角色，都有他的性格、出身和气质上的特点，因此，就应该用不同的表现方式来表现他，如果机械地去摹仿某一些前辈先生的动作和唱腔，生硬地用到另一个剧目中去，就会格格不入。另一方面，在观摩过两三位成名的老前辈的演技之后，发见他们在表演同一个剧目时，各有各的表演风格，而且各有特长，才理解到在表演艺术上是允许结合个人的条件和特长进行创造的。这样就开始建立起我自己创造新的艺术形象的信心和决心。我当时唯一的要求就是：非但要合情合理，而且人物要生动真实，使观众受到深刻的感染；直到今天我才理解这些要求就是演剧艺术上现实主义精神的起码条件。
    回忆起来，我觉得自己对舞台表演艺术的革新过程，也正是一个艰苦复杂的斗争过程，这一过程，并不是通行无阻的顺利发展的过程，虽然得到人民大众的支持和欢迎，但也遭遇到很多保守分子的反对，长期间受到文字上的讽刺和言语中的嘲笑。
    在过去的日子里，无论在我的幼年、壮年或中年时代，封建主义和帝国主义的代理人——官僚、地主、买办阶级都在诱引着我们戏曲工作者走向堕落的道路，如果偶然站不住脚跟，就会立刻毁灭了自己；为自己的良心和正义所驱使，我从来没有自暴自弃，成为他们的俘虏或者被他们的恶势力所屈服；在民族苦难的年月，梅先生八年不演戏，我也用“徽钦二帝”等来和他们搏斗。个人的力量是非常微弱的，我那时的情况正如驾着一只小船，在漫漫长夜中，通过惊涛骇浪，由此岸驶往彼岸，随时都有覆灭的危险。
    我们以百倍兴奋的心情来迎接全国解放的时候，虽然已经过了我们的中年时期，但在呼吸了新时代的空气以后，我们却感觉到自己又年轻了。六年来，在党和人民政府的正确领导下，在毛主席“百花齐放，推陈出新”的戏改方针的指导下，我们戏曲工作者的政治水平和业务水平提高了，我们的戏曲事业有了新的生命，在蓬勃向上地向前发展。让我们再一次感谢伟大的中国共产党和我们最敬爱的毛主席。
　　最后，请允许我谈一谈我个人对今天这一个纪念会的体会和感想：
    梅先生和我，虽然在过去五十年舞台生活中对戏曲事业有过一点一滴的贡献，但在今天这样一个隆重的纪念会上来接受这一崇高的荣誉，我们就感觉到自己的贡献与这样的荣誉不很相称了；不过从另一个角度来看，今天这个纪念会，也充分显示出国家和人民对我们戏曲工作者的尊重与热爱，我们的国家和人民，希望产生出更多的有高度修养的戏曲艺术家与千千万万的青年艺术家，来满足广大人民日益增长的文化生活的要求。无疑的，今天这样的纪念会，将会对广大的文艺工作者起一种鼓舞的作用。
    全国戏曲工作者同志们，让我们大家努力学习，努力创作出新的艺术作品吧！让我们大家通过不懈的艺术实践，实现艺术改革吧！我们即使只有一点一滴贡献给予人民，人民也决不会忘掉我们。梅先生和我虽然都是六十岁的人了，但我们的精神永远不老，我们愿与全国戏曲工作者同志携手并进，为祖国的伟大的社会主义建设事业奋斗到底。
