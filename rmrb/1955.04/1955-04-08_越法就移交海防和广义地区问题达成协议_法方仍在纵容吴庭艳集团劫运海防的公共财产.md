Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th. According to Vietnam News Agency: At the meeting of the Vietnam Central Joint Armistice Commission on the 5th, Vietnam and France reached an agreement on the schedule for the withdrawal and handover of the Haiphong area by the French side and the withdrawal and handover of the Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh areas by the Vietnamese side.

The work of withdrawing and transferring troops from the above two areas will begin on April 22nd and be completed by May 16th. According to the agreement, the French side should completely withdraw from the Hon Gai area on April 24th and completely withdraw from the Haiphong port on May 13th. Thus, by mid-May, the military transfer work stipulated by the Vietnam Armistice Agreement will be completed.

Although both sides have reached an agreement on the withdrawal and handover of the above-mentioned last two temporary garrison areas, the issue of handing over public property and public institutions in the Haiphong area has not been satisfactorily resolved. The French side still refuses to provide the Vietnamese side with a complete list of public institutions and public property in Haiphong, and continues to connive with Ngo Dinh Diem's agents to transfer public property to South Vietnam.

    越法就移交海防和广义地区问题达成协议
    法方仍在纵容吴庭艳集团劫运海防的公共财产
    新华社河内七日电　据越南通讯社讯：在越南中央联合停战委员会五日会议上，越、法双方已经就法方撤离和移交海防地区同越方撤离和移交广义、平定地区的时间和计划问题达成协议。
    从上述两个地区撤离和转移部队的工作将从四月二十二日起开始，到五月十六日完成。根据协议，法方应在四月二十四日完全撤离鸿基区域，在五月十三日完全撤离海防港。这样，到五月中，越南停战协定所规定的双方军事转移工作就将完成。
    虽然双方已经就撤离和移交上述最后两个临时驻扎地段问题达成协议，但是关于移交海防地区公共财产和公共机关问题还没有圆满地解决。法方仍然拒绝把海防公共机关和公共财产的完整清单交给越方，而继续纵容吴庭艳的代理人把公共财产转移到南越去。
