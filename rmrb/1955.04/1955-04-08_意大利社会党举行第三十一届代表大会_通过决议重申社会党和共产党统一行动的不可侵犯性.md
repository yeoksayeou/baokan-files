Xinhua News Agency, Rome Dispatch: The 31st Congress of the Italian Socialist Party, which opened in Turin on March 31, has concluded.

Representatives of the Italian Communist Party and various democratic organizations delivered congratulatory messages to the congress at the opening session on the morning of March 31. In the afternoon of March 31, Nenni delivered a report to the congress on "The Socialist Party's Struggle for Democracy in Society and the Nation, and for Peace."

In his report, Nenni emphasized that the most serious fact about the domestic situation in Italy is the systematic violation of constitutional rights, the infringement of political freedoms, and the trade union freedom of the working people in enterprises, rural areas, and public and private institutions. There are both international and domestic reasons for this situation, the latter arising from the former.

Nenni said: It is impossible to reform society without a fierce struggle. Capitalism will not now, nor will it in the future, easily give up the positions it occupies.

Nenni then spoke about the issue of all sound forces in Italy taking united action in the struggle for Italy's progress. He emphasized that, for the Socialist Party, the policy of taking united action with the Communist Party is a sacred and inviolable achievement, and a permanent factor in this policy is the shared responsibility to the working class and the masses of the people.

Nenni said: We demand that the government take and support all measures that may promote reconciliation between East and West and the restoration of the unity of West and East Germany outside the scope of hostile blocs. We demand that the government promote disarmament, convene a conference on European security, and ban atomic and nuclear weapons. We demand that the government not create political obstacles that hinder the expansion of trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, and that the government restore normal diplomatic and trade relations with the People's Republic of China.

Nenni finally called on the Socialist Party to fight for raising living standards, reforming taxes, and opposing unemployment and poverty, and to fight for peace.

The congress passed a resolution on the party's policy. The resolution reaffirmed the inviolability of the agreement on unified action concluded between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, and pointed out the Socialist Party's willingness to strengthen ties with Catholic masses in the struggle to defend democratic freedoms, strive for economic and social progress, and strive for peace.

The resolution firmly condemned the policies of military blocs—the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the "Western European Union"—and expressed the Socialist Party's firm desire to strive to ease world tensions and establish friendly relations between countries.

The congress also passed a resolution on the upcoming elections for the Sicilian Regional Assembly. The congress elected the Central Committee of the Socialist Party. The new leadership elected Pietro Nenni as the party secretary and Rodolfo Morandi as the deputy secretary.

    意大利社会党举行第三十一届代表大会
    通过决议重申社会党和共产党统一行动的不可侵犯性
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利社会党第三十一届代表大会三月三十一日在都灵开幕，会议已经结束。
    意大利共产党和各民主组织的代表在三月三十一日上午的开幕会议上向大会致贺词，三月三十一日下午，南尼在大会上就“社会党人为社会和国家的民主而斗争、为和平而斗争”作了报告。
    南尼在报告中强调指出，意大利国内局势最严重的事实是有计划地侵犯宪法权利，侵犯政治自由以及各企业、乡村和公私机构中的劳动人民的工会自由。造成这种局势有国际的和国内的两方面的原因，而后者是从前者产生的。
    南尼说：不经过一场严酷的斗争而要改革社会是不可能的。资本主义现在不会、将来也不会让人轻易拿去它所据有的阵地。
    南尼接着谈到意大利的一切健全的力量在争取意大利进步的斗争中采取一致行动的问题。他强调说，对社会党来说，同共产党采取一致行动的政策是一个神圣不可侵犯的成果，这个政策的一个永久因素就是共同对工人阶级和人民群众负责。
    南尼说：我们要求政府采取和支持一切可能促进东西方之间的和解和在敌对集团的范围外来恢复西德和东德的统一的一切措施，我们要求政府促进裁减军备、召开关于欧洲安全的会议和禁止原子武器及核子武器。我们要求政府不得制造阻挠扩大同苏联和东欧国家间贸易的政治障碍，要求政府同中华人民共和国恢复正常的外交和贸易关系。
    南尼最后号召社会党人为提高生活水平、改革赋税和反对失业和贫困及争取和平而斗争。
    大会通过了关于党的政策的决议。决议重申社会党和共产党缔结的关于统一行动的协定的不可侵犯性，并且指出了社会党在保卫民主自由、争取经济和社会进展、争取和平的斗争中加强同天主教群众联系的意愿。
    决议坚决斥责军事集团——北大西洋公约组织和“西欧联盟”——的政策，表示了社会党人竭力争取缓和世界紧张局势和在各国之间建立友好关系的坚定愿望。
    大会还通过了关于西西里区议会最近将举行选举的决议。大会选出了社会党的中央委员会。新的领导机构选出彼得罗·南尼为党的书记，罗多夫·摩兰为副书记。
