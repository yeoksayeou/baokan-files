    Qinghai People Welcome Petroleum Survey Team

    The survey team dispatched by the Geological Bureau of the Petroleum Administration Bureau to the Qaidam Basin—they will provide data for petroleum exploration—received cordial greetings from the party and government leaders of Qinghai Province while passing through Xining. They participated in various welcome rallies and received a large number of letters of appreciation from people of all ethnic groups and from all walks of life in Qinghai Province. The majority of the surveyors are young students fresh out of school, as well as technical personnel from Shanghai and other places who have come to support the surveying work. They have all made assurances that they will overcome all difficulties and complete and over fulfill the surveying task. Chen Wenming, a member of Team 406, wrote in a reply to the students of the Qinghai Provincial Cadre School: "Reading your letter makes me feel full of strength. Even the most difficult areas cannot stop our determination to find oil. I must study technology hard, overcome all difficulties, and do a good job in surveying." (Xinhua News Agency)

    青海人民欢迎石油测量队
    石油管理总局地质局派往柴达木盆地的测量队——他们将为石油勘探提供资料——在路经西宁时，受到了青海省党、政首长的亲切慰问。他们参加了各种欢迎集会，并收到青海省各族各界人民的大批慰问信。这批测量人员中绝大部分是刚出学校的青年学生，也有上海等地前来支援测量工作的技术人员。他们都纷纷提出保证，表示要克服一切困难，完成和超额完成测量任务。四零六队队员陈文明在给青海省干部学校学员的回信中写道：“读了你们的来信，使我感到浑身都是力量，就是再艰难的地区，也阻挡不了我们寻找石油的决心，我一定要努力学习技术，克服一切困难，做好测量工作。”　（新华社）
