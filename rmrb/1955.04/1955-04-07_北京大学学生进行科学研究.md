Since the beginning of this semester, the scientific research groups of Peking University students have greatly developed, and there are now more than twenty scientific research groups in the entire university.

    The Zoology Research Group of the Biology Department is working on the study of "Locust Ecology"; they are also conducting experiments with rabbits, fish, birds, etc. Their activities are carried out under the direct leadership of teachers in the teaching and research section; teachers take them along when they do scientific research. The Animal Physiology Research Group is conducting "conditioned reflex" experiments, using the "Pavlov's small stomach" of dogs to observe its gastric juice secretion. The Plant Research Group, in coordination with the "Plant Systematics" course, plans to conduct plant surveys and observations on campus. The Plant Physiology Research Group is using fertilization to control the number of male and female cucumber flowers, in order to produce more female flowers and increase yield; they were once led by teachers from the Plant Physiology Teaching and Research Section to visit the "Sijiqing Vegetable Cooperative" in the suburbs of Beijing.
    More than fifty students from four classes in the second grade of the Mathematics Department formed five scientific research groups, which were combined into one large group, under the direct leadership of teachers from the Mathematical Analysis and Function Theory Teaching and Research Section. They have already discussed the problem of "a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere."
    Sixteen second-year students from the Department of Economics participated in a scientific research group. They discussed the "Issue of Handicraft Cooperatives" and the "Basic Economic Laws of Our Country During the Transition Period."
    Many departmental-level scientific research groups have launched activities in conjunction with the current critique of academic thought.
    Students in the Chinese Department are focusing on criticizing Hu Feng's anti-Marxist literary and artistic thought. Fourth-year students majoring in Chinese language have established three research groups focusing on criticizing Hu Feng's literary and artistic thought, namely the "Literary Theory" group, the "Literary Heritage" group, and the "Literary Movement" group, with more than thirty people participating. Twenty-nine third-year students majoring in Chinese language participated in the "Critique of Hu Feng's Literary and Artistic Thought" group. The "Literary Study" group, jointly organized by students from four classes in the first year of the Journalism Department, has held discussions on "The Main Problems and Errors of Hu Feng's Idealist Literary and Artistic Thought."
    Students in the Philosophy and History Departments are focusing on criticizing Hu Shih's reactionary ideology. The scientific research groups of the second and third grades of the Philosophy Department plan to criticize Hu Shih's epistemology, realism, methodology, idealist view of history, and the essence of Hu Feng's thought this semester. They are currently reading Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" and other classic works. Graduate students in the History Department are entering the stage of writing papers. The "Modern Chinese History" research group has begun collectively writing a paper on "Critique of Hu Shih's Reactionary View of History," and the "Asian History" research group has begun writing a paper on "Japanese Imperialism and Hu Shih."

    北京大学学生进行科学研究
    这学期开学以来，北京大学学生的科学研究小组有很大发展，目前全校已有二十多个科学研究小组。
    生物系动物研究小组在着手研究“蝗虫生态”；同时用兔子、鱼、鸟等进行实验。他们的活动是在教研室教师直接领导下进行的；教师做科学研究的时候，带他们一起做。动物生理研究小组在做“条件反射”实验，利用狗的“巴氏小胃”来观察它的胃液分泌。植物研究小组配合“植物系统学”课，预定在校园内作植物的调查和观察。植物生理研究小组正利用施肥来控制黄瓜雌雄花的数目，使多生雌花，增加产量；他们曾在植物生理教研室教师带领下，集体去京郊“四季青蔬菜合作社”参观。
    数学系二年级四个班有五十多个学生组成了五个科学研究小组，合成一个大组，由数学分析及函数论教研室教师直接领导。他们已经讨论了“处处连续但处处不可微的函数”问题。
    经济系二年级学生有十六人参加科学研究小组。他们讨论了“手工业合作社问题”和“我国过渡时期基本经济法则”。
    不少系级的科学研究小组结合目前学术思想批判展开了活动。
    中文系学生着重进行对胡风的反马克思主义文艺思想的批判。语文专业四年级学生成立了以批判胡风文艺思想为主的三个研究小组，即“文艺理论”组、“文学遗产”组和“文艺运动”组，共有三十多人参加。语文专业三年级有二十九人参加了“胡风文艺思想批判”小组。新闻学专业一年级四个班的学生联合组织的“文艺学习”组已举行过“胡风唯心论文艺思想的主要问题及错误所在”的讨论会。
    哲学系、历史系学生着重进行对胡适反动思想的批判。哲学系二年级和三年级的科学研究小组，这学期拟批判胡适的认识论、实在论、方法论、唯心史观和批判胡风思想本质。目前他们正在阅读列宁的“唯物论与经验批判论”等经典著作。历史系研究生进入写论文阶段。“中国近代史”研究组已开始集体撰写“胡适的反动历史观批判”的论文，“亚洲史”研究组已开始写“日本帝国主义和胡适”的论文。　（北京大学通讯组）
