Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, April 7th: The Burmese newspaper "Rangoon Daily" published an editorial on the 2nd welcoming the upcoming Asian-African Conference in Bandung. The editorial stated that Asian and African countries that have not yet freed themselves from the colonial system, and those that have achieved liberation, will discuss their political, economic, and social problems through this Asian-African Conference, thereby establishing close relationships.

The editorial believes that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in the joint statements of the Prime Ministers of China and India, and China and Burma, are acceptable to countries with differing political views. The United States seems uneasy about the Asian-African Conference, but the people of Asian and African countries need cooperation to control their own countries' destinies.

    缅甸报纸著论欢迎即将召开的亚非会议
    新华社七日讯　仰光消息：缅甸“仰光日报”二日发表社论欢迎即将在万隆召开的亚非会议。社论写道，亚洲和非洲地区中未摆脱殖民主义制度的国家和获得了解放的国家，将通过这次亚非会议讨论彼此的政治、经济与社会问题，并从而建立密切的关系。
  社论认为，中印、中缅总理联合声明中的和平共处五项原则是政治见解不同的国家都能接受的。美国似乎为亚非会议感到不安，但亚非国家的人民需要的是进行合作，掌握自己国家的命运。
