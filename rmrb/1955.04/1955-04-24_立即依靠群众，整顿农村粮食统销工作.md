    The amount of grain sold by the state in rural areas this year is entirely sufficient according to the actual needs of grain-deficient farmers. However, at present, there is an artificial tension in many rural areas. Many farmers who are not actually short of grain are also buying grain from the state, causing grain sales to greatly exceed the needs of farmers and the state's plans. This situation is very detrimental to the state and to farmers who are truly short of grain, and urgent measures must be taken to stop it. The most important thing is to announce the grain sales quota stipulated by the state for each township to all farmers, mobilize farmers to discuss reasonable sales methods, and ensure that only truly grain-deficient households can buy grain, while those who are not short of grain should not buy grain. This is a major matter that must be done immediately and without delay in all provinces and regions with excessive grain sales.
    At present, a small number of farmers are indeed short of food. Many of them are because they suffered from disasters last year and the grain they produced themselves was not enough to eat; some of them sold too much grain and changed from surplus grain households to grain-deficient households. In view of this situation, the state has allocated a large amount of grain to meet the needs of grain-deficient farmers. The problems of the majority of people have been satisfactorily resolved. In some areas, due to the untimely supply of grain, grain-deficient farmers have experienced temporary difficulties. For example, in late March, Rehe Province only issued half of the grain supply certificates in sixteen counties and banners. It is natural for those who have not received their supply certificates to raise some opinions about the grain work. But this is only a small number of cases.
    The serious problem in the unified purchase and sale of grain does not lie here. Truly grain-deficient farmers only account for a small number of the rural population nationwide, and the problems of a small number of people are easy to solve. The serious problem now is that many farmers who are not short of grain are also asking the state to supply grain, just like farmers who are short of food. Some farmers originally had enough grain to be self-sufficient. Seeing others buying grain from the state, they blindly shouted that there was not enough grain and hoped to buy some. Some farmers originally had a surplus of grain, but because they were afraid that others would criticize them for selling too little grain, or afraid that others would borrow grain from them, they deliberately shouted along with others. These farmers are relatively wealthy. They take the lead in shouting about grain shortages and compete to purchase grain, artificially creating an atmosphere of tension. Their behavior is completely wrong and must be opposed. For example, the grain sales coverage in Qinglong County, Rehe Province, reached 79% of the rural population; in some counties in Jiangsu Province, the grain supplied, calculated on the basis of the average population of the entire county, once reached 1.5 to 1.65 jin per person per day. This is of course extremely unreasonable. Qinglong County is not a disaster area, and last year's grain unified purchase task was not too heavy. How could four-fifths of the farmers be short of food? Although a small number of farmers in these counties in Jiangsu are short of grain, it is absolutely impossible for all farmers to need the state to supply more than one jin of grain per person per day!
    These serious problems in the unified purchase and sale of grain are inseparable from the weaknesses in the work of some grass-roots cadres. In some places, some grass-roots cadres engage in corruption and malpractice, buying more grain for themselves and shielding relatives and friends from buying more grain. In this way, they have laid down their weapons in front of those farmers who deliberately shout about grain shortages. In a small number of places, truly grain-deficient farmers cannot buy grain. For example, Nan Shilin, the supply group leader of Xijiang County, Shanxi Province, was not short of grain, but he bought more than 100 jin. He was in the wrong, and his mouth was soft. He had no way to deal with village cadres and farmers who demanded to buy more grain. But this situation is only a very small minority. In most places, because the unified purchase and sale of grain is originally a new and complex matter, many grass-roots cadres lack methods, cannot make up their minds, and do not know how to rely on the masses to wage a just and forceful struggle against those who pretend to be short of grain and "grab a share." When they encounter farmers who demand to be supplied with grain, they often arbitrarily approve it, thus breaking through the state's sales targets. Hao Yuhou, the financial and grain committee member of Podong Village, Wangfan Township, Anyi County, Shanxi Province, said: "Our village has added seven new grain-deficient households (actually only two households). We did not review them and reported them to the higher authorities. If the higher authorities approve it, we will supply it; if the higher authorities do not approve it, they will find their own way." Some county, district, and township cadres are afraid that there will not be enough grain to supply, and mistakenly adopt the method of "being generous in estimating and tight in using," falsely reporting the amount of unified sales to the higher authorities, deducting it layer by layer, and keeping it as "contingency grain." These will of course hinder the correct progress of the unified purchase and sale of grain work.
    If the leading organs of the Party and the government, especially the leading organs at the county level, can grasp the grain unified purchase and sale work firmly, the situation will greatly improve. However, many county-level leading organs have not paid timely attention to solving the grain sales problem with great effort, and even blindly shout along with grass-roots cadres and farmers, demanding that the higher authorities increase grain supplies. This has created the current situation of excessive grain sales in some areas.
    It can be seen from this that the crux of the current grain unified purchase and sale problem in rural areas is not the small amount of grain supply, but the problems with the supply work. The main way to change this situation is not to increase the supply, but to rectify the grain unified purchase and sale work. All parts of the country, especially the areas with excessive grain sales at present, must use great efforts to carry out a solid rectification of the grain unified purchase and sale work on the basis of "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales." This is not only necessary for the grain work, but also of extremely great significance for stabilizing the emotions of farmers and supporting the current spring plowing and sowing campaign.
    The state's grain unified purchase and sale policy is very clear. That is: those who should be supplied must be supplied, those who should be supplied less should be supplied less, and those who should not be supplied must not be supplied. Only in this way can fairness and reasonableness be achieved, meeting the needs of grain-deficient farmers on the one hand, and not breaking through the state's supply targets on the other hand.
    In order to implement the state's grain unified purchase and sale policy and quickly reverse the current situation of excessive grain sales, it is necessary to rely on the broad masses of rural people. First of all, it is necessary to announce the grain sales targets to the farmers in the whole country, with the township as the unit, and mobilize the farmers to democratically discuss and decide on the objects and quantities of grain supply, forming a mass movement to rectify the grain unified purchase and sale work. In this movement, it is necessary to tell the farmers about the grain unified purchase and sale policy. Through in-depth and extensive publicity, the broad masses of farmers should understand that every farmer has the obligation to implement and supervise others to implement the grain unified purchase and sale policy; whoever is short of grain should ask the state to supply grain, ask for as much as they need, and should never underreport or overreport; whoever is not short of grain should not ask the state to supply grain, otherwise, if they buy what they should not buy, those who should buy will not be able to buy; whoever has bought too much grain in the past should automatically return the extra part, which will be sold by the state to truly grain-deficient farmers. All localities should, on the basis of ideological education, mobilize farmers to calculate the quantity of grain production and unified purchase and sale, determine the boundary between surplus grain households and grain-deficient households according to the established consumption standards, and then conduct democratic evaluation to determine who should buy grain, who should not buy grain, and who should return the extra grain they have bought. The grain unified purchase and sale problem is closely related to the personal interests of every household and every person in the countryside. To solve it correctly, fairly, and reasonably, it is necessary to convene Party branch meetings, township people's congresses, and village meetings to mobilize the broad masses of farmers, so that everyone can express their opinions, everyone can be educated, and everyone can take responsibility.
    Some areas have already rectified the grain unified purchase and sale work. These experiences not only prove that the grain sales targets set by the state are sufficient, but also prove that solving the grain problem must rely on the masses. Songdian Township in Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, originally requested the state to supply an additional 10,170 jin of grain. After rectifying the grain unified purchase and sale work, not only did it no longer request the state to increase the supply, but it also had a surplus of more than 6,200 jin of contingency grain. Seven townships and five villages in Liangshan, Yuncheng, Juye and other counties in Shandong Province rectified the unified sales work. As a result, they reissued more than 59,000 jin of grain to 243 grain-deficient farmers, and at the same time, 620 farmers voluntarily proposed to cancel and reduce the supply of 475,000 jin of grain. The experience of these areas proves that giving grain to those who are truly short of grain will not cause any objection from those who are not short of grain. But if those who are not short of grain are allowed to buy grain, it will not only increase the state's grain sales, but also affect the unity of farmers, which is detrimental to the state and the farmers.
    Grass-roots cadres have a great responsibility in the grain unified purchase and sale work. We ask grass-roots cadres to go deep into the masses, fully implement the state's grain unified purchase and sale policy, and patiently help farmers to draw a clear line between surplus grain and grain-deficient grain, and reasonably determine the objects and standards of supply. We ask grass-roots cadres to improve the methods of grain unified purchase and sale, and try to make it convenient for farmers without causing them any trouble. We ask grass-roots cadres to set an example, handle affairs impartially, and resolutely oppose buying more than one needs, corruption, malpractice, and other illegal and disciplinary violations.
    At present, it is the season with the most grain sales, and it is the season when spring plowing and sowing are extremely tight and farmers who are short of food urgently need support. We must adapt to the requirements of the masses, allocate a certain amount of strength according to the different conditions in various places, and take the necessary time to quickly rectify the grain unified purchase and sale work. This work must be done well, and this work can certainly be done well.

### 立即依靠群众，整顿农村粮食统销工作

    立即依靠群众，整顿农村粮食统销工作
    本年度国家在农村销售的粮食，按照缺粮农民的实际需要来说，完全是足够的。但是，目前在不少的农村中却有一种人为的紧张，许多本来不缺粮的农民也向国家购买粮食，使粮食的销售超过农民的需要和国家的计划很多。这种情形对于国家和真正缺粮的农民是很不利的，必须采取紧急措施加以停止。最重要的，就是要将国家规定的每一个乡的粮食销售指标向全体农民宣布，动员农民讨论合理的销售办法，保证做到真正缺粮的人家才能买到粮食，而不缺粮的人家就不应当买粮食。这是在一切粮食超额销售的省区所必须立即做好、不许有任何拖延的一件大事。
    目前有一小部分农民确实是缺乏口粮的。其中不少人是因为去年遭受了灾害，自己生产的粮食原来就不够吃；有的是因为卖的粮食太多，由余粮户变成了缺粮户。鉴于这种情况，国家拨出了大批粮食供应缺粮农民的需要。多数人的问题得到了圆满的解决。还有部分地区由于粮食供应得不及时，缺粮的农民发生了暂时的困难。例如三月下旬，热河有十六个县、旗还只发了一半粮食供应证，那些没有领到供应证的人，对粮食工作提出一些意见，这是很自然的。但是这只是很少数的情形。
    粮食统销中严重的问题并不在这里。真正缺粮的农民只占全国农村人口的少数，少数人的问题是容易解决的。现在的严重问题在于许多不缺粮食的农民，也和缺少口粮的农民一样，要求国家供应粮食。有些农民的粮食本来可以自给自足，看到别人向国家买粮食，他们也盲目地叫喊粮食不够，希望买到些粮食。有些农民的粮食本来有富余，只是因为害怕别人批评自己售粮太少，或是害怕别人来借粮，故意和别人一起叫喊起来。这些农民都是比较富裕的，他们带头喊叫缺粮，并且争购粮食，人为地造成了一种紧张空气，使得粮食统销超过了定额，他们的行为是完全错误，必须加以反对的。例如，热河省青龙县的粮食统销面达到了农村人口的百分之七十九；江苏省有些县份供应的粮食，按全县人口平均计算，曾经达到每人每日一斤五两至一斤六两半。这当然是极端不合理的。青龙县并非灾区，去年的粮食统购任务并不过重，哪能有五分之四的农民缺少口粮？江苏的这些县份，虽然有一小部分农民缺粮，也绝对不至于全部农民每人每天都需要国家供应一斤多粮食！
    粮食统销中发生的这些严重问题，和某些基层干部工作中的弱点是分不开的。在有些地方，有一些基层干部徇私舞弊，自己多买粮食，并且包庇亲友多买粮食，这样，他们在那些故意叫喊缺粮的农民面前就放下了武器。另有少数地方却又使真正缺少口粮的农民买不到粮食。例如，山西省新绛县供应组长南石林，他不缺粮，却多买了一百多斤。他的理短了，嘴软了，对于要求多购粮食的村干部和农民，就没有办法应付了。但是这种情形只是极少数。在大多数地方，由于粮食统销本来是一件新的复杂的事情，许多基层干部缺少办法，拿不定主意，不懂得依靠群众同那些冒充缺粮的“捞一把”的人们作理直气壮的斗争，遇有要求供应粮食的农民，往往任意批准，因而突破国家销售指标。山西安邑县王范乡坡东村财粮委员郝玉厚就说：
  “我们村里新增加七个缺粮户（实际只有两户），我们没有审查，就报上去了。上级批准了，我们就供应；上级批不准，他们自己去想办法。”有些县、区、乡干部害怕粮食不够供应，错误地采取“宽打窄用”的办法，向上级虚报统销数额，层层克扣，留作“机动粮”。这些当然要妨碍粮食统销工作的正确进行。
    如果党和政府的领导机关，特别是县一级的领导机关，能够抓紧粮食统销工作，情况就会大大好转。但不少县级的领导机关，对于粮食销售问题却没有及时地注意用大力来解决，甚至跟着基层干部和农民盲目叫喊，要求上级增加粮食供应。这样就造成了目前一部分地区的粮食超额销售的情形。
    由此可见，目前农村粮食统销问题的症结并不是粮食供应量少，而是供应工作有毛病。改变这种情况的主要办法不是增加供应量，而是整顿粮食统销工作。全国各地，首先是目前粮食超额销售的地区，必须用大力在粮食“定产、定购、定销”的基础上，把粮食统销工作加以切实的整顿。这不但对于粮食工作是必要的，对于安定农民的情绪，支援当前的春耕播种运动，也具有极为重大的意义。
    国家的粮食统销政策是非常明确的。这就是：该供应者一定供应，该少供应者就少供应，不该供应者一定不要供应。只有这样，才能作到公平合理，一方面满足了缺粮农民的需要，同时又不致突破国家的供应指标。
    为了贯彻国家的粮食统销政策，迅速扭转目前的粮食超额销售的情况，必须依靠农村的广大群众。首先必须在全国范围内，以乡为单位，向农民公布粮食统销的指标，发动农民民主议定供应粮食的对象和数量，形成一个整顿粮食统销工作的群众运动。在这个运动当中，一定要把粮食统销政策告诉农民，通过深入、广泛的宣传，使广大农民懂得：每一个农民都有执行并且监督别人执行粮食统销政策的义务；谁家缺少粮食，就应该要求国家供应粮食，缺多少要求多少，绝不应该以少报多；谁家不缺粮食，就不应该要求国家供应粮食，否则，不该买的买了，该买的就买不到了；谁家过去多买了粮食，就应该自动退出多买的部分，由国家卖给真正缺粮的农民。各地应在思想教育的基础上，发动农民计算粮食生产和统购统销的数量，根据既定的消耗标准，定出余粮户和缺粮户的界线，然后进行民主评议，确定谁家该买粮食，谁家不该买粮食，谁家应该把多买的粮食退出来。粮食统销问题同农村的每一家每一口都有切身利害关系，要使它解决得正确、公平、合理，必须召集党的支部大会、乡人民代表大会和村民大会，把广大农民发动起来，使人人都能发表意见，人人都能受到教育，人人都能负起责任。
    有些地区已经整顿了粮食统销工作，这些经验不但证明国家规定的粮食统销指标是够用的，而且证明解决粮食问题必须依靠群众。山西闻喜县宋店乡原来要求国家多供应一万零一百七十斤粮食，整顿粮食统销工作以后，不仅不再要求国家增加供应量，而且余出了六千二百多斤机动粮。山东梁山、郓城、巨野等县的七个乡又五个村整顿了统销工作，结果给二百四十三户缺粮的农民补发粮食五万九千多斤，同时有六百二十户农民自动提出取消和减少四十七万五千多斤粮食的供应量。这些地区的经验证明，把粮食供应给真正缺粮的人，不缺粮食的人是不会有意见的。但如果让不缺粮食的人买到粮食，就不仅要增加国家的粮食销售量，而且会影响农民的团结，对国家、对农民都是不利的。
    基层干部在粮食统销工作中负有重大的责任。我们要求基层干部深入群众，全力贯彻国家的粮食统销政策，耐心地帮助农民划清余粮和缺粮的界线，合理地确定供应的对象和标准。我们要求基层干部改进粮食统销工作的方法，尽量使农民感到方便，不要给农民增加麻烦。我们要求基层干部以身作则，秉公办事，坚决反对多购冒领、徇私舞弊和其他违法乱纪行为。
    目前正是销售粮食最多的季节，是春耕播种空前紧张、缺少口粮的农民迫切要求支援的季节。我们必须适应群众的要求，按照各地不同的情况，调配一定的力量，抽出必要的时间，迅速把粮食统销工作整顿好。这个工作一定要做好，这个工作一定能够做好。
