    Leninism is the Banner of the World's Working People in the Struggle for Peace, Democracy and Socialism
    – Written in Commemoration of the 85th Anniversary of Lenin's Birth
    Wu Yuzhang
    Leninism is a doctrine representing the fundamental interests of the world's working people, a powerful weapon for the world's working people in their struggle for liberation, and the banner for the world's working people in their struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

    (I)
    One of Lenin's greatest contributions was to arm the proletariat and working people of all countries with a new theory of socialist revolution, enabling them to fight for peace, democracy, and socialism.

    In the early 20th century, under new historical conditions, Lenin made a profound analysis of imperialism, pointing out that imperialism was the eve of the proletarian socialist revolution. Lenin did not adhere to the old formula put forward by Marx and Engels during the rise of capitalism, that a socialist revolution could not first succeed in one country but must succeed simultaneously in all advanced capitalist countries. In 1915, in his article "On the Slogan for a United States of Europe," he put forward a new formula for socialist revolution suitable for the era of imperialism: socialism may first triumph in a few or even a single capitalist country.

    Lenin's new conclusion that socialism could first triumph in one country creatively enriched and advanced Marxism. The historical practice of world revolution over the past forty years has fully confirmed that Lenin's theory of socialist revolution is the only correct one. Under the guidance of Leninism, the Russian proletariat led the entire people to achieve the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution in 1917. The victory of the October Revolution was a typical realization of Lenin's theory of socialist revolution. It opened a new era in human history. Lenin not only put forward the new conclusion that socialism could first triumph in one country, but also profoundly demonstrated that a proletarian dictatorship could build a complete socialist society even when surrounded by imperialism. He also formulated a plan to transform Russia from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country by building socialism. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, leading the Soviet people, based on Lenin's principles for building socialism, built a bright socialist society on one-sixth of the world's land in twenty years. Now, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is leading the people to realize Lenin's instructions on the transition from socialism to communism, confidently advancing towards the victory of communism. The construction of a socialist society in the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union's gradual transition to communism, have great international significance. This greatly encourages the world's working people in their struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

    If the victory of the October Revolution was the first typical realization of Lenin's theory of socialist revolution, then the emergence of people's democratic countries in Europe and Asia after World War II was another typical realization of Lenin's theory of socialist revolution. Countries that have broken away from the capitalist system and established people's democratic systems have creatively applied the principles of Leninism to restore their national economies in a very short period of time and have begun socialist construction in a planned way. People's democratic countries have also received selfless assistance from the Soviet Union in their construction. Now, the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries of Europe and Asia have formed a consolidated camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. This is a new phenomenon in the international socialist revolutionary movement, a law-abiding phenomenon arising under the new historical conditions in which people's democracy and socialism have already triumphed in many countries. The united strength of this camp cannot be broken by any enemy. The significant achievements constantly made by the people's democratic countries in socialist construction once again prove that the socialist system has unlimited vitality.

    (II)
    Lenin always attached importance to and cared about the national colonial question, linking it with the world's working people's struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism for study and resolution.

    Lenin, unlike the opportunists of the Second International, did not limit the national question to the narrow confines of "civilized" nations. Based on the fact that the world's nations in the era of imperialism were divided into two major categories, oppressor nations and oppressed nations, and based on the fact that the working people of all nations in the era of imperialism were equally subjected to the enslavement and oppression of imperialists, he expanded the national question into a world question of oppressed people in colonial and dependent countries throwing off the shackles of imperialism, and linked the liberation struggle of oppressed nations with the socialist movement in oppressor nations. Lenin pointed out that the revolution carried out by the proletariat of each capitalist country "will not be merely and mainly a struggle of the revolutionary proletarians of each country against their own bourgeoisie; no, it will be a struggle of all the colonies and countries oppressed by imperialism, of all dependent countries, against international imperialism." ("Report to the Second All-Russia Congress of Communist Organizations of the Peoples of the East") Because the victory of the socialist revolution in the main capitalist countries will inevitably accelerate the liberation of the people of colonial and dependent countries; and the strengthening of the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of colonial and dependent countries will inevitably shake the foundation of imperialist rule, making the socialist revolution in capitalist countries easier to carry out.

    After Lenin pointed out the path to victory for the people of colonial and dependent countries, he gave a series of valuable instructions on how the people of these countries should achieve victory. Lenin believed that the prerequisite for achieving victory was the establishment of a new type of Marxist party, and that this party must creatively apply Marxism well, based on the specific historical conditions of its own country, and absorb the revolutionary experiences of various countries, especially Russia. Lenin believed that another important condition for the victory of the struggle of the people of colonial and dependent countries was the adherence to the idea of proletarian leadership when formulating strategies and tactics. In the era of imperialism, it was impossible for the national colonial liberation movement to achieve victory without the leadership of the proletariat. The central issue of the idea of proletarian leadership is the worker-peasant alliance. Lenin believed that in backward countries where peasants constitute the vast majority of the population, the relationship between the proletariat and the peasants is the key to determining the success or failure of the revolution. Therefore, the proletarian party must free the peasants from the influence of the bourgeoisie, thereby establishing a solid worker-peasant alliance. Lenin not only pointed out the necessity of the worker-peasant alliance, but also believed that it was necessary to distinguish between the bourgeoisie of imperialist countries and the bourgeoisie of colonial and dependent countries. Although the national bourgeoisie of colonial and dependent countries cannot become the leading force against imperialism and feudalism due to its compromise, it is possible for them to participate in the national democratic revolution under certain conditions and to a certain extent. Therefore, Lenin believed that the proletarian parties of these countries should establish a revolutionary united front with the bourgeois democrats, but must maintain "the independence of the proletarian movement" in the united front. Only in this way can the national colonial liberation movement achieve victory.

    Lenin pointed out that the colonial people can only carry out the socialist revolution after going through the bourgeois democratic revolution, and also put forward the idea of how the colonial people can skip the stage of capitalist development and transition to socialism after achieving the victory of the national democratic revolution, from the patriarchal and feudal system. In 1920, Lenin said at the Second Congress of the Communist International: "The Communist International should establish and theoretically prove the following proposition: with the help of the proletariat of the most advanced countries, backward countries can avoid the stage of capitalist development and transition to the Soviet system, and through a certain stage of development, transition to communism." This brilliant idea is of immeasurable significance to the people of the colonial and semi-colonial countries that have already achieved victory, in their struggle to build socialism.

    If Leninism's doctrine that the socialist revolution could first triumph in one country pointed out the revolutionary future to the proletariat of capitalist countries, encouraging them to attack the bourgeoisie of their own countries and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat, then Lenin's doctrine on the national colonial question pointed out the revolutionary future to the working people of colonial and dependent countries, inspiring their enthusiasm to launch attacks on imperialism and feudalism. Inspired by the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, the oppressed people of colonial and dependent countries, especially the people of the East, actively launched a struggle to get rid of imperialist oppression.

    Since the October Revolution, the great Soviet Union has continuously assisted the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people. It was precisely due to the encouragement of the October Revolution that the advanced elements of the Chinese people accepted Marxism-Leninism. Since the Chinese workers' movement combined with Marxism-Leninism to produce the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese revolution, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, has taken on a completely new look.

    The Chinese Communist Party was established from the very beginning in accordance with the Leninist principles of party building. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party has consistently used Lenin's thought as a guide, overcome various forms of opportunist thought, creatively combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, and formulated a complete theory and strategy of the new democratic revolution. The Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people through nearly thirty years of heroic struggle, finally defeating the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group supported by various imperialists, especially American imperialism, achieving the great victory of the people's democratic revolution, and establishing the People's Republic of China.

    The great victory of the Chinese revolution is the victory of Marxism-Leninism. The experience of the Chinese revolution is a model for the creative application of Leninism in colonial and semi-colonial countries, and has great significance for the struggle of the working people of other colonial and dependent countries.

    From the time of the founding of the People's Republic of China, China began to enter the historical period of transition from a new democratic society to a socialist society. Lenin said that in order to create a socialist society, a relatively long transition period from capitalism to socialism is needed, a period that cannot but be a period of struggle between dying capitalism and growing communism. The theory of the transition period created by Lenin and developed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, headed by Stalin, in socialist construction is entirely suitable for China at the present stage. Based on this theory of the transition period, and based on Lenin's instructions that backward countries can avoid the stage of capitalist development and reach socialism with the help of the proletariat of advanced countries after achieving victory, the Chinese Communist Party, learning from the rich experience of the Soviet Union in building socialism, creatively formulated the Party's general line for the transition period. This general line is the program for the Chinese people to carry out socialist construction through peaceful means. Now, the Chinese Communist Party is strengthening the unity and unification of its ranks, timely exposing and smashing the activities of class alien elements to corrupt and split the Party, strengthening the Party's leading role, striving to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, uniting the people of all nationalities across the country, and struggling to build socialism.

    The great victory of the Chinese people's revolution and its great achievements in socialist construction have raised the Asian national liberation movement to a new and higher stage. The establishment and development of the People's Republic of China, the Mongolian People's Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have fundamentally changed the situation in Asia, greatly strengthening the advantage of the world socialist camp. The national liberation movements in Asia and the world's colonial and semi-colonial countries have further risen after World War II with world-shaking momentum, constantly striking at the aggressive bloc headed by American imperialism. It can be seen that, under the guidance of Leninism, the anti-imperialist torrent formed by the socialist revolutionary movement and the national liberation movement of colonial and dependent countries has fundamentally shaken the foundation of imperialist rule over the past half century.

    Socialism will inevitably advance from the victory of the present few countries to the victory of the whole world.

    (III)
    Lenin brilliantly solved the problem of the working people of capitalist countries carrying out socialist revolution and the problem of the people of colonial and dependent countries carrying out national liberation struggles and finally embarking on socialism, and also brilliantly solved the problem of the relationship between countries where the working people have won victory and capitalist countries where the working people have not yet won victory. This is Lenin's idea of the possibility of peaceful coexistence between two systems, capitalism and socialism.

    Lenin's principle of the possibility of peaceful coexistence between the two systems is the basis for the socialist camp countries to determine their peaceful foreign policy. It is precisely according to Lenin's instructions that the Soviet Union has unswervingly adhered to a peaceful foreign policy. The People's Republic of China and the people's democratic countries, taking the Soviet Union as an example, have also always advocated and strived for peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems. The peaceful foreign policy of the socialist camp countries is a policy of ensuring international peace and security, opposing the launching of new world wars, and strengthening international cooperation and developing contacts between countries.

    Historical facts prove that there are no obstacles from the socialist camp in order to organize international cooperation and achieve peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems. The socialist system itself requires a peaceful international environment for construction, requires countries to expand economic, political, and cultural ties with each other on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, and will fundamentally never invade or interfere in any country. The socialist camp countries advocate peaceful competition with capitalist countries. In this peaceful competition, socialism and the people's democratic system will increasingly show their unparalleled superiority over the capitalist system. The peaceful foreign policy of the socialist camp countries is completely in line with the interests of their own people and the people of all countries in the world, and therefore has won the support of the broad masses of people in the world.

    In contrast to the peaceful foreign policy of the socialist camp countries, the imperialist aggressive bloc adopts a policy of aggression and war. Now, the ruling groups of imperialist countries, headed by the United States, are constantly taking various reactionary measures, frantically implementing the so-called "policy of strength" aimed at the socialist camp countries. This is building military bases everywhere on the territory of other countries, organizing various military and political groups and aggressive alliances, carrying out an arms race and the threat of atomic war, stepping up the arming of West Germany and Japan, supporting and fostering the reactionary forces of various countries, carrying out espionage and sabotage activities, and actively preparing and launching new world wars. Their dream is to vainly attempt to overthrow the countries where the working people have already won victory and restore imperialist rule throughout the world. Since the peace forces forced the Korean armistice and the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue, the imperialist aggressive bloc has more frantically carried out arms expansion and war preparations, intensified the advocacy of atomic war, and included the use of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs in its military adventure plans, which is an extremely serious threat to all peace-loving people in the world.

    In order to oppose the threat of a new war provoked by imperialism, the worldwide people's movement to defend peace is unfolding more widely and deeply, reaching an unprecedented scale. The people of the world have suffered deeply from the disasters of two world wars and are determined to fight heroically to oppose war and defend peace. In this struggle, the united peace, democracy, and socialist camp is a powerful fortress and the basic force for defending world peace. The Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries, as well as all peace-loving people in the world, are fighting for substantial reductions in armaments, the prohibition of the production and use of atomic weapons, the establishment of collective security systems, and the easing of international tensions; advocate resolving international disputes through consultation; and advocate developing peaceful friendship and cooperative relations between the peoples of all countries on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. The joint statement of the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers and the Chinese and Burmese Prime Ministers in June 1954 established the five principles of peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems. On these principles, China and India and China and Burma established friendly cooperative relations, providing a good example for peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems and playing a significant role in the cause of world peace. The ongoing Asian-African Conference will also make valuable contributions to promoting friendly cooperation among Asian and African countries and maintaining peace in the Asian-African region and the world. The concerted action of the countries participating in the Moscow Conference on Ensuring European Peace and Security, held from the end of November to the beginning of December 1954, demonstrated the powerful strength of the socialist camp's unity and was universally welcomed by peace-loving people. The Chinese people's struggle to liberate their own territory, Taiwan, is an important part of the struggle to defend peace in Asia and the world.

    The basic characteristic of the current international situation is that the forces of peace are engaged in a tense struggle with the forces of war, and the balance of power between the two camps has changed in favor of the socialist camp. The only urgent task facing the world today is to actively safeguard world peace and take all measures to combat the criminal conspiracies of warmongers and "atomic maniacs." Only by waging a resolute struggle against the most aggressive forces and their conspiracies can international tensions be eased and peace be maintained.

    And the great friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people plays a decisive role in defending world peace. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Under the great cooperation of our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, all imperialist aggressive plans cannot but be smashed. ... As long as imperialism launches a war of aggression, we and the people of the world must wipe them out from the face of the earth!" (February 15, 1955, "People's Daily")

    In our era, the revolutionary people of the whole world draw the wisdom of struggle from Leninism. Those who correctly use Leninism as a weapon can be invincible; at the same time, Leninism is increasingly enriched and constantly developed creatively due to the summary of new experiences in revolutionary struggle.

    Under the banner of Leninism, the working people of the whole world are constantly pushing history forward, and the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has become the leading force determining the development of human history. Now, the working people of the whole world are uniting to further smash the war conspiracies of imperialism headed by the United States, and to fight for new victories in peace, democracy, and socialism. Leninism will forever radiate immortal brilliance to the whole world. No force in the world can stop the cause of Leninism from advancing. Peace, democracy, and socialism will surely win complete victory.

    列宁主义是全世界劳动人民争取和平民主和社会主义斗争的旗帜
    ——为纪念列宁八十五周年诞辰而作
    吴玉章
    列宁主义是代表全世界劳动人民根本利益的学说，是全世界劳动人民为争取自身解放而斗争的强大武器，是全世界劳动人民为争取和平、民主和社会主义而斗争的旗帜。
    （一）
    列宁最伟大的贡献之一，就是以新的社会主义革命理论武装了各国无产阶级和劳动人民为争取和平、民主和社会主义而斗争。
    二十世纪初期，在新的历史条件下，列宁对帝国主义作了深刻的分析，指出帝国主义是无产阶级社会主义革命的前夜。列宁没有拘守马克思恩格斯在资本主义上升时期所提出的社会主义革命不可能在一个国家首先胜利，而必须在各先进资本主义国家同时胜利的旧公式。一九一五年，他在“论欧洲联邦口号”一文中提出了适合帝国主义时代的关于社会主义革命的新公式：社会主义可能首先在少数或甚至单独一个资本主义国家内获得胜利。
    列宁关于社会主义可能首先在一国内胜利的新结论，创造性地丰富了并向前发展了马克思主义。近四十年来世界革命的历史实践完全证实了列宁的社会主义革命理论是唯一正确的。在列宁主义的指导下，俄国无产阶级领导全体人民在一九一七年取得了伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利。十月革命的胜利是列宁社会主义革命理论的典型的实现。它开辟了人类历史的新纪元。列宁不仅提出了社会主义可能首先在一国内胜利的新结论，并且深刻地论证了在帝国主义包围形势下，无产阶级专政的国家能够建成完备的社会主义社会。他并制定了把俄国由落后农业国变为先进工业国的建设社会主义的计划。苏联共产党领导苏联人民，依据列宁关于建设社会主义的原理，经过二十年的时间，在世界六分之一的土地上建成了光辉灿烂的社会主义社会。现在，苏联共产党正在领导人民实现着列宁主义关于从社会主义过渡到共产主义的指示，满怀信心地向着共产主义胜利迈进。社会主义社会在苏联的建成，以及苏联逐渐向共产主义的过渡，具有伟大的国际意义。这极大地鼓舞着全世界劳动人民为争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争。
    如果说，十月革命的胜利，是列宁的社会主义革命理论第一次典型的实现，那么，第二次世界大战后欧亚两洲各人民民主国家的出现，就是列宁的社会主义革命理论又一次典型的实现。摆脱了资本主义体系并建立了人民民主制度的国家，由于创造性地运用了列宁主义原理，在极短时期内恢复了国民经济，并有计划地开始进行了社会主义建设事业。人民民主国家在建设中，并得到了苏联大公无私的援助。现在，苏联、中国和欧亚两洲人民民主国家已结成了巩固的和平、民主和社会主义阵营，这是国际社会主义革命运动中产生的新现象，是当人民民主和社会主义已经在许多国家内取得胜利的新历史条件下产生的合乎规律的现象。这个阵营的团结力量，是任何敌人也攻不破的。人民民主国家在社会主义建设中不断取得的重大成就，再一次证明社会主义制度具有无限的生命力。
    （二）
      列宁一直重视和关怀民族殖民地问题，他将民族殖民地问题和全世界劳动人民争取和平、民主和社会主义的问题联系起来加以研究和解决。
    列宁和第二国际机会主义者相反，不把民族问题局限在“文明”民族的狭隘范围内，他根据帝国主义时代世界各民族分成压迫民族和被压迫民族两大类的事实，根据帝国主义时代世界各民族劳动人民同样受帝国主义者奴役和压迫的事实，把民族问题扩大为殖民地附属国被压迫人民摆脱帝国主义桎梏的世界问题，把被压迫民族的解放斗争同压迫民族中的社会主义运动联系起来。列宁指出：各资本主义国家无产阶级所进行的革命，“不会只是和主要是每一国革命无产阶级反对本国资产阶级的斗争；不，它将是受帝国主义压迫的所有一切殖民地和国家，所有一切依赖国反对国际帝国主义的斗争”。
  （“在东方各族人民共产主义组织第二次全俄代表大会上的报告”）因为各主要资本主义国家社会主义革命的胜利，必然加速殖民地附属国人民获得解放；而殖民地附属国人民的反对帝国主义斗争的加强，必然要动摇帝国主义的统治基础，使资本主义各国的社会主义革命易于进行。
    列宁向殖民地附属国人民指出了走向胜利的道路之后，又对于这些国家的人民如何去取得胜利作了一系列的宝贵指示。列宁认为为了取得胜利，先决的条件是必须建立一个新型的马克思主义的政党，而这个党必须很好地根据本国具体历史条件创造性地运用马克思主义，并吸取世界各国，尤其是俄国的革命经验。列宁认为，殖民地附属国人民斗争取得胜利的另一个重要条件是在制定战略策略时必须坚持无产阶级领导权的思想。在帝国主义时代，民族殖民地解放运动没有无产阶级的领导而要走向胜利是不可能的。无产阶级领导权思想的中心问题是工农联盟问题。列宁认为，在农民占人口绝大多数的落后国家里，无产阶级同农民的关系是决定革命胜败的关键，因此，无产阶级政党必须使农民摆脱资产阶级的影响，从而建立巩固的工农联盟。列宁不仅指出了工农联盟的必要，而且认为必须把帝国主义国家和殖民地附属国的资产阶级区别开来。殖民地附属国的民族资产阶级，虽然由于它的妥协性不能成为反对帝国主义和封建主义的领导力量，但在一定条件下和一定程度上参加民族民主革命是可能的，因此，列宁认为，这些国家的无产阶级政党应该同资产阶级民主派建立革命统一战线，但在统一战线中必须保持“无产阶级运动的独立性”。只有这样，民族殖民地解放运动才能取得胜利。
    列宁指出了殖民地人民只有经过资产阶级民主革命才能进行社会主义革命，而且提出了殖民地人民在取得了民族民主革命的胜利之后，如何从宗法封建制度跨过资本主义发展阶段过渡到社会主义的思想。一九二○年列宁在共产国际第二次代表大会上曾说：“共产国际应当确立并在理论上论证下列命题：在最先进国家底无产阶级帮助之下，落后国家可以避免资本主义的发展阶段，过渡到苏维埃制度，并经过一定的发展阶段过渡到共产主义。这一光辉思想对于已经取得胜利的殖民地半殖民地国家的人民，在其建设社会主义的斗争中，有无可估量的巨大意义。
    如果说，列宁主义关于社会主义革命可能首先在一国胜利的学说向资本主义国家无产阶级指出了革命的前途，鼓舞他们去进攻本国的资产阶级，去建立无产阶级专政；那么，列宁关于民族殖民地问题的学说就是向殖民地附属国劳动人民指出了革命的前途，激发了他们对帝国主义和封建主义展开进攻的积极性。在伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利的鼓舞下，殖民地附属国的被压迫人民，特别是东方各国人民，积极展开了摆脱帝国主义压迫的斗争。
    自从十月革命以后，伟大的苏联不断地援助中国人民的革命斗争。正是由于十月革命的鼓舞，中国人民中的先进分子接受了马克思列宁主义。自从中国工人运动同马克思列宁主义相结合产生了中国共产党以后，中国革命在中国共产党领导下，面貌焕然一新。
    中国共产党一开始就是按照列宁主义的建党原则建立起来的。在毛泽东同志的领导下，中国共产党一贯地以列宁的思想为指针，克服了形形色色的机会主义思想，创造性地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合，制定了完整的新民主主义革命的理论和策略。中国共产党领导中国人民经过了近三十年的英勇斗争，终于战胜了各帝国主义尤其是美国帝国主义支持的蒋介石反动集团，取得了人民民主革命的伟大胜利，建立了中华人民共和国。
    中国革命的伟大胜利是马克思列宁主义的胜利。中国革命的经验，是在殖民地半殖民地国家创造性地运用列宁主义的典范，对其他殖民地附属国的劳动人民的斗争有着巨大的意义。
    从中华人民共和国成立的时候起，中国就开始进入了从新民主主义社会过渡到社会主义社会的历史时期。列宁说过，为了创立社会主义社会，需要一个较为长久的由资本主义进到社会主义的过渡时期，这个时期不能不是死亡着的资本主义同生长着的共产主义彼此斗争的时期。由列宁所创立并为以斯大林为首的苏联共产党在社会主义建设中发展了的过渡时期的理论对于现阶段的中国是完全适合的。中国共产党根据这个过渡时期的理论，根据列宁关于落后国家取得胜利后在先进国家无产阶级帮助下可以避免资本主义发展阶段达到社会主义的指示，学习苏联建设社会主义的丰富经验，创造性地制定了党在过渡时期的总路线。这一总路线是中国人民通过和平的道路进行社会主义建设的纲领。现在，中国共产党正在增强自己队伍的团结和统一，及时地揭露和粉碎阶级异己分子腐蚀党和分裂党的活动，加强党的领导作用，努力巩固工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，团结全国各族人民，为建成社会主义而斗争。
    中国人民革命的伟大胜利及其在社会主义建设中的巨大成就，使亚洲民族解放运动提高到一个新的更高阶段。中华人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国的建立和发展，根本改变了亚洲的形势，大大地加强了世界社会主义阵营的优势。亚洲和世界各殖民地半殖民地的民族解放运动在第二次世界大战后进一步地以震动世界的声势在日益高涨起来，对以美国帝国主义为首的侵略集团给以不断的打击。可以看见，半世纪来，在列宁主义思想指导下，社会主义革命运动同殖民地附属国的民族解放运动所汇合成的反对帝国主义的巨流，已经根本动摇了帝国主义的统治基础。
    社会主义必定将要由现在的几国胜利进而达到全世界的胜利。
    （三）
    列宁光辉地解决了资本主义国家的劳动人民进行社会主义革命的问题和殖民地附属国的人民进行民族解放斗争，最后走上社会主义的问题，同时也光辉地解决了劳动人民获得了胜利的国家同劳动人民尚未取得胜利的资本主义国家之间的相互关系问题。这就是列宁的关于资本主义同社会主义两个制度可能和平共处的思想。
    列宁的两个制度可能和平共处的原则，是社会主义阵营各国确定和平外交政策的基础。正是根据列宁的指示，苏联在始终不渝地坚持了和平外交政策。中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家以苏联为榜样，同样地一向主张并努力争取不同制度国家的和平共处。社会主义阵营各国的和平外交政策，是保障国际和平和安全，反对发动新的世界战争的政策，是加强国际合作、发展各国事务联系的政策。
    历史事实证明：为了组织国际合作，为了达到不同制度国家的和平共处，并没有任何来自社会主义阵营的障碍。社会主义制度本身要求国际和平环境来进行建设，要求各国彼此在平等互利的原则下扩大经济、政治和文化上的联系，更根本不会侵略和干涉任何国家。社会主义阵营各国主张同资本主义国家进行和平竞赛。在这种和平竞赛中，社会主义和人民民主制度将日益显示出自己较之资本主义制度的无比的优越性。社会主义阵营各国的和平外交政策，是完全符合本国人民和世界各国人民的利益的，因此获得了世界上广大人民的拥护和支持。
    同社会主义阵营各国的和平外交政策相对立，帝国主义侵略集团采取的是侵略政策和战争政策。现在，以美国为首的帝国主义国家的统治集团正在不断地采取各种反动措施，疯狂地执行矛头指向社会主义阵营各国的所谓“实力政策”。这就是在其他国家领土上到处建立军事基地，组织各种各样的军事政治集团和侵略性联盟，进行军备竞赛和原子战争的威胁，加紧进行武装西德和日本，扶持和豢养各国的反动势力，进行特务间谍破坏活动，积极准备和发动新的世界大战。他们的迷梦是妄想推翻劳动人民已经获得胜利的国家，恢复帝国主义在全世界的统治。自从和平力量迫使朝鲜停战及印度支那问题和平解决以后，帝国主义侵略集团更加疯狂地进行扩军备战，变本加厉地鼓吹原子战争，并把使用原子弹、氢弹列入它的军事冒险的计划之内，这是对全世界爱好和平人民的极严重的威胁。
    为了反对帝国主义所挑拨的新战争的威胁，全世界人民保卫和平的运动正在日益广泛和深入地展开，达到了空前未有的规模。世界人民深受两次世界大战的灾难，坚决地为反对战争、保卫和平而英勇斗争。在这个斗争中，团结一致的和平、民主和社会主义阵营是保卫世界和平的强大堡垒和基本力量。苏联、中国和各人民民主国家以及全世界爱好和平的人民都为大量裁减军备、禁止生产和使用原子武器、建立集体安全体系、缓和国际紧张局势而斗争；主张通过协商解决国际争端；主张在平等互利互相尊重领土主权的基础上发展各国人民之间的和平友好和合作关系。一九五四年六月中印总理、中缅总理的联合声明确立了不同制度的国家和平共处的五项原则，在这些原则上中印和中缅建立了友好合作的关系，为不同制度的国家之间的和平共处提供了良好的范例，对世界和平事业起着重大的作用。正在举行的亚非会议也将对促进亚非国家的友好合作和维护亚非地区及世界的和平作出有价值的贡献。参加一九五四年十一月底到十二月初召开的关于保障欧洲和平和安全的莫斯科会议的国家的一致行动，表现了社会主义阵营团结的强大力量，受到了爱好和平的人民的普遍欢迎。中国人民为解放自己领土台湾的斗争，是保卫亚洲和世界和平斗争的重要部分。
    目前国际形势的基本特点是和平力量同战争势力进行着紧张的斗争，两个阵营之间的力量对比已经发生了有利于社会主义阵营的变化。当前全世界面临的唯一迫切任务，就是积极维护世界和平，采取一切措施打击战争贩子和“原子狂人”的罪恶阴谋。只有对最富侵略性的势力和它们的阴谋展开坚决的斗争，才能缓和国际紧张局势，保持和平。
    而中苏两国人民的伟大友谊合作，在保卫世界和平中起着决定的作用。毛泽东同志说：“在我们中苏两国的伟大合作下，一切帝国主义的侵略计划，没有不能被粉碎的。……只要帝国主义发动侵略战争，我们和全世界人民就一定要将它们从地球上消灭干净！”（一九五五年二月十五日“人民日报”）
    在我们的时代里，全世界的革命人民都从列宁主义这里吸取斗争的智慧，凡是正确地运用列宁主义这个武器的就能无往而不胜；同时，列宁主义又因为有了革命斗争的新经验的总结而日益丰富，不断地得到创造性的发展。
    在列宁主义的旗帜下，全世界的劳动人民不断地把历史推向前进，以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营已经成为决定人类历史发展的主导力量。现在，全世界劳动人民正团结一致地为进一步粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义的战争阴谋而斗争，为争取和平、民主和社会主义的新胜利而斗争。列宁主义将永远向全世界放射出不朽的光辉。世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡列宁主义的事业前进。和平、民主和社会主义一定会彻底胜利。
