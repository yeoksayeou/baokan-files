Xinhua News Agency, April 26th—This afternoon, more than 600 women from all circles in Beijing held a grand welcoming meeting to warmly welcome Mrs. Eugénie Cotton, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, and French women Mrs. Vildemeer, Mrs. Alexander, and Mrs. Balantini, who are visiting our country.
    Xu Guangping and Zhang Yun, Vice-Presidents of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, also attended the welcoming meeting.
    At the welcoming meeting, Zhang Xiaomei, Chairman of the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation, delivered a welcoming speech, saying: Mrs. Gordon's outstanding contributions to the noble cause of defending peace and safeguarding the rights and interests of women and children have won the respect and love of women and mothers all over the world. She also said: The women of Beijing, like the women of all of China, have always respected and deeply cared about the heroic struggles of the French people and French women to defend peace and democracy. We believe that this visit of Mrs. Gordon and other French friends to our country will further enhance the understanding and friendship between Beijing and Paris, and between Chinese and French women.
    In her speech, Mrs. Gordon said: We are very happy to be able to gather with you in beautiful Beijing and bring the cordial friendship of French women to you. Then, in the name of the President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, she congratulated the Chinese people and Chinese women on all the achievements they have made. She said that peace is the guarantee of happy families and a bright future for children. At present, although great victories have been won for peace throughout the world, the threat of war still exists. A new war will be more cruel than all past wars. Mothers will never allow their children to suffer the disasters of war. Therefore, the Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation passed two resolutions in February this year to firmly support the World Peace Council Standing Committee's appeal in Vienna against the manufacture and use of atomic weapons, and to convene the World Mothers' Congress in July this year to defend children, oppose war, and strengthen friendship between the people of all countries. We must unite all men and women of different religions, opinions, and beliefs and strive for lasting peace.
    After Mrs. Gordon's speech, Mrs. Vildemeer, Mrs. Alexander, and Mrs. Balantini all spoke. After the speeches, Mrs. Gordon and others received flowers from the children of Beijing amidst warm applause.
    After the meeting, a wonderful artistic performance was staged.

    北京各界妇女集会热烈欢迎戈登夫人
    新华社二十六日讯　二十六日下午，北京市各界妇女六百多人举行盛大的欢迎会，热烈欢迎前来我国访问的国际民主妇女联合会主席欧仁妮·戈登夫人和法国妇女维尔德美夫人、亚历山大夫人和巴朗蒂尼夫人。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席许广平和章蕴也参加了欢迎会。
    欢迎会上，北京市民主妇女联合会主席张晓梅致欢迎词，她说：戈登夫人在保卫和平、保卫妇女儿童权益的崇高事业中所作出的卓越贡献，博得了全世界妇女和母亲们的崇敬和热爱。她又说：北京市的妇女和全中国妇女一样对法国人民和法国妇女为保卫和平和民主所作的英勇斗争，一向是尊敬和深切关心的。我们相信，这次戈登夫人等法国朋友来我国访问，将会更进一步地增进北京和巴黎，中国和法国妇女之间的了解和友谊。
    戈登夫人在讲话中说：我们非常高兴能在美丽的北京和你们聚会，并将法国妇女亲切的友谊带给你们。接着她以国际民主妇女联合会主席的名义祝贺中国人民和中国妇女所获得的一切成就。她说，和平是幸福的家庭和孩子们美好的未来的保证。目前，虽然，在全世界和平已经取得了很大胜利，但是战争的威胁仍然存在，一场新的战争将比过去一切战争更为残酷，母亲们决不允许她们的孩子遭受战争的灾害，因此，国际民主妇女联合会理事会今年二月通过了坚决支持世界和平理事会常务委员会在维也纳发出的关于反对制造和使用原子武器的呼吁，以及今年七月召开保卫儿童、反对战争、加强各国人民之间友谊的世界母亲代表大会两项决议，我们必须把一切不同宗教、不同意见、不同信仰的男女团结起来，为争取持久和平而努力。
    戈登夫人讲话以后，维尔德美夫人、亚历山大夫人和巴朗蒂尼夫人都讲了话。讲话后，戈登夫人等在热烈的掌声中接受了北京市儿童的献花。
    会后，演出了精采的文艺节目。
