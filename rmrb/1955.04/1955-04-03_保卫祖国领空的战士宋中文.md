One clear autumn day, the pilots were practicing ground target shooting. The commander pointed to a plane about to dive and said to me:

	"Look, that's Song Zhongwen."

I looked in the direction he was pointing, and a plane was already diving very low. A burst of fire suddenly appeared in front of the nose of the plane, followed by the sound of gunfire, and piles of dust rose on the target range. The plane rushed to a low altitude, and with a whoosh, it shot into the high sky like an arrow just released from a bow.

A year ago, he still needed someone to guide him to fly and land in the new type of aircraft; more than half a year ago, he had just learned to fly this aircraft alone. But today, he can not only fly skillfully, but also skillfully operate the aircraft for shooting.

Song Zhongwen was born into a poor peasant family in Northeast China. Before liberation, he had never even seen an airplane. Mastering advanced flight theory is very tricky for pilots with low levels of education. Song Zhongwen was one of them. But he constantly overcame it with his hard work and dedication. He seized every minute to study, and if studying once wasn't enough, he would do it a second time; if he had any insights, he would write them down in his notebook. Sometimes, he simply wrote them on the back of his hand, walking, looking, and thinking. Some questions were very difficult, and perhaps after chewing on them for a whole day, he still couldn't figure them out. Then, the quiet of the night became a good opportunity for him to think. At this time, if he could figure something out, he would sit up from the bed, put on his clothes, turn on the light, and write it down in his little diary.

Learning theory was difficult, but putting it into practice was even more difficult. He learned the principles of shooting, but how could he accurately judge distance, aim, and shoot? He still couldn't figure it out. Song Zhongwen had tried various methods to practice and train according to regulations. He often selected a distant aircraft, visually estimated its distance, and then ran hundreds of meters to actually measure it to see how big the difference was. Once, twice, gradually, his judgment of distance became almost accurate.

As the commander was talking to me, the target marker came to report: Song Zhongwen hit the target with fifteen of the twenty shells he fired. At this time, the commander immediately said to me: "See, he could only hit three or five shells when he started shooting, but now he has improved." The commander added: "I always feel that the growth of the People's Air Force trained by the Party can be seen from Song Zhongwen."

I met Song Zhongwen for the second time around the "May 1st" holiday in 1954, when he came to Beijing to watch the parade. I knew that he had already shot down two enemy planes and damaged one in the battle to defend the motherland's airspace. When we met, I asked him to talk about the battle situation.

Song Zhongwen first talked about an unforgettable battle. One early morning, Song Zhongwen and his wingman ran to the plane to take over the first-class alert mission from their comrades. The signal flare for takeoff rose, and Song Zhongwen and his wingman immediately and accurately flew towards the enemy plane according to the order. The ground commander told them: The enemy plane was continuing to fly from south to north. So he decided to cut straight east, preparing to turn back and intercept the enemy. Song Zhongwen searched nervously. During a turn, he spotted a yellowish-gray object that looked no more than an inch long far below and to his left. He turned, with the sun behind him, making it difficult for the enemy to detect him, and flew towards the target. After a while, the target changed from a long strip to a cross shape. Song Zhongwen determined that it was an enemy plane. He increased his throttle and pressed closer, circling behind the enemy plane to launch a surprise attack. But his overly excited mood affected his aiming, and the shells he fired all landed behind the enemy plane. He immediately calmed down, increased his speed, corrected his aiming point, and fired another burst of shells. This time the shells all hit the tail of the enemy plane. The enemy plane was frightened and wanted to escape to the left. At this time, Song Zhongwen was about to attack to the left again, and the enemy plane that was turning to escape happened to expose its tail to Song Zhongwen. He seized this opportunity and chased straight down. Seeing that the situation was not good, the enemy lowered its altitude in a panic, and then raised its head again, trying to counterattack from below. The brave Song Zhongwen quickly approached the enemy plane and shot the shells straight into the enemy plane with accurate shooting. The enemy plane emitted thick smoke and finally crashed into the sea.

Next, Song Zhongwen told me about another battle. He shot down one and damaged another of two enemy planes that were plotting to sneak into the motherland's airspace to harass it. He also told the story of how he and his comrades learned to master night flight technology and took on night alert missions. He said:

"It was the Party that trained me from an ordinary peasant into a pilot, and from someone who didn't understand air combat into a warrior who could defeat the enemy in air combat." His air combat and night flight stories told me that he had made further progress.

Less than a year later, I met Song Zhongwen again at this airport. He could not only fly during the day and when the weather was good at night, but also learned to fly during the day, especially at night when the weather was bad. I personally saw his skillful movements as he flew through dense clouds at night.

One night, I saw Song Zhongwen in a small house next to the taxiway at the airport. He was wearing his full flight suit and was writing something at a table in front of a lamp. It turned out that he was on night alert duty that day. He was ready at any time, and as soon as he discovered any signs of the enemy trying to invade the motherland's airspace, he and his comrades would fly their night planes to meet the enemy. I picked up the little notebook he was writing in and flipped through it, and it was full of densely packed small characters. At this time, I brought up the examples of Song Zhongwen's hard work in studying technology that the commander had mentioned in the conversation. Song Zhongwen said modestly: "It's still far from enough. Such profound theories and technologies can't be done without hard work! Take flying through clouds at night, for example. It's dark and you can't see anything in the clouds, and you often have illusions. It's clearly level flight, but sometimes you feel like the plane is flying upside down or diving. This requires relying entirely on instruments, calculations, and ground commands to control the plane. But there are dozens of instruments alone, and two eyes are simply not enough. In addition to this, we must also calculate and correct the impact of high-altitude winds and maintain the flight attitude...; we must also consider how many minutes and seconds we have been flying and whether we should turn. If you don't understand these principles and don't master these techniques, you definitely won't be able to fly, let alone fight the enemy.

"In order not to be restricted by weather conditions, in order to be able to strike at the enemy who invades the motherland's airspace in any situation, my comrades and I are determined to overcome all difficulties and master this technology. We have no other tricks, only to study diligently and practice hard." Song Zhongwen said seriously at the end.

At the first Air Force Heroic Model Meritorious Representatives Conference, Song Zhongwen, who was constantly advancing, had mastered complex flight technology, ensured flight safety for a long time, and made a first-class contribution in the battle to defend the motherland's airspace, was honorably selected as a second-class model pilot.

    保卫祖国领空的战士宋中文
    侯祖沛
    一个秋高气爽的日子，飞行员们在练习着打地靶。指挥员指着一架将要俯冲的飞机对我说：
    “看，那就是宋中文。”
    我顺着他手指的方向看过去，一架飞机已经俯冲得很低了。机头前部突然冒出一阵火光，接着响起了炮声，靶场上冲起了一堆堆尘烟。飞机冲到低空，唰的一声，又像刚离弦的箭样射向高空。
    一年以前，他还要别人带着才能在新式飞机上飞上去、落下来；半年多以前，他也刚学会在这种飞机上单独飞行。但今天，他不仅能熟练地飞行，而且能熟练地操纵这架飞机射击了。
    宋中文出身在东北一个贫农家庭里。解放以前，他连飞机也没看见过。掌握高深的飞行理论，对于文化程度很低的飞行员来说，是很棘手的。宋中文就是其中的一个。但他用艰苦的钻研精神不断战胜着它。他抓住每一分钟时间学习，学一遍不行，就再来第二遍；有一点心得，就往本子上记。有时，他干脆记在手背上，边走着、边看着、边想着。有些问题是很艰深的，也许咀嚼整整一天也还不摸门，那么，夜深人静的时候，又成了他思索的好机会。这时，能够想出一点，他就从床上坐起来，披上衣服拧开电灯，记在小日记本上。
    学理论难，实际运用起来更难。学了射击原理，但怎样才能正确判断距离、瞄准和射击呢？还是不摸门。宋中文曾经想了各种办法，按照规定来进行实习、锻炼。他经常选定远处一架飞机，目测了它的距离，再跑上几百公尺去实际量量，看差错到底多大。一次、两次，渐渐地，他对距离的判断差不多了。
    指挥员正和我说着，枪靶员来报告：宋中文打出的二十发炮弹，十五发命中了目标。这时，指挥员紧接着对我说：“是吧，开始打靶时，他不过能打三、五发，但现在进步了。”指挥员又说：“我总感到，从宋中文身上，可以看出党培养的人民空军的成长。”
    我第二次会见宋中文，是在一九五四年“五一”节前后，他来到北京观礼。我知道他已经在保卫祖国领空的战斗中，击落两架敌机、击伤一架敌机了。见面时，我就要求他讲战斗情况。
    宋中文首先讲起了一次难忘的战斗。一天清晨，宋中文和僚机飞行员跑到飞机跟前接替了战友们的一等警戒任务。起飞的讯号弹升起了，宋中文和僚机立即准确地根据命令迎着敌机飞去。地面指挥员告诉他们：敌机正继续由南向北飞。于是他决定朝东直插过去，准备再回转过来拦截敌人。宋中文紧张地搜索着。一次转弯时，他在左前下方很远的地方发现一个看来不过一寸长的黄灰色的东西。他转过弯来，背着阳光，使敌人不容易发觉，迎着目标飞去。一会，目标由长条形变成了十字形。宋中文判定它是敌机。他加大油门紧逼过去，绕到敌机后面进行突然的袭击。但他过于激动和兴奋的心情，影响了瞄准，他射出的炮弹都落在敌机后面了。他立刻沉住气，增加速度，修正了瞄准点，又发出一阵炮弹。这次炮弹都打中了敌机的尾部。敌机吓得想向左逃跑。这时，宋中文正要向左再次攻击，扭头逃跑的敌机也正好把机尾暴露给宋中文。他抓紧这个机会直追下来。敌人见势不妙，仓惶降低高度，然后又扬起头来，企图从下向上反击。勇敢的宋中文迅速地逼近敌机，用准确的射击，把一颗颗炮弹直射进敌机。敌机冒起了浓烟，最后栽在大海里。
    接着，宋中文对我讲述了他另一次战斗。他把阴谋窜入祖国领空进行骚扰的两架敌机，击落了一架，击伤了一架。他还讲述了他和战友们一道学会了掌握夜间飞行技术，并担负了夜间警戒任务的故事。他说：
    “党就是这样把我由一个普通的农民培养成一个飞行员，由不懂空战培养成能在空战中击败敌人的战士。”他的空战和学习夜航的故事告诉我，他又进步了。
    不到一年，在这个机场上，我又会见了宋中文。他不仅仅能在白天和夜间天气很好的时候飞行，还学会了在白天、特别是在夜间天气不好的时候飞行。我亲眼看到他在夜间驾着飞机穿过浓云飞行的熟练动作。
    一天夜晚，我在机场滑行道旁的一间小屋里看到宋中文。他穿着全副飞行服正伏在灯前一张桌上写着什么。原来这天他担任夜间警戒，他随时准备着，只要发现有敌人企图侵犯祖国领空的迹象，他和战友们就驾着夜航机去迎击敌人。我顺手拿起他正写着的那本小本子翻看了一下，上面写着密密麻麻的小字。这时我提起了指挥员谈话中讲到的宋中文刻苦钻研技术的那些事例来。宋中文谦虚地说：“还差得远呢。这么高深的理论和技术，不下苦工夫可不行啊！就说夜间穿云，在云里黑糊糊地什么也看不见，还时常会发生错觉。明明是平飞，但有时偏感到飞机是倒着飞或是在俯冲。这就完全要依靠仪表、计算和地面指挥来操纵飞机。但单是仪表就有几十个，两只眼睛简直忙不过来。这以外，还要计算和修正高空风的影响，保持飞行姿态……；还要考虑飞了几分几秒时间，是不是应该转弯了。不弄通这些道理，不熟练这些技术，肯定飞不起来，更别提打敌人了。
      “为了不受气象条件的限制，为了能在任何情况下打击侵犯祖国领空的敌人，战友们和我都决心要突破一切困难掌握这技术。我们没有什么别的窍门，只有老老实实地勤学苦练。”最后宋中文严肃地说。
    在空军首届英雄模范功臣代表大会上，这位不断前进着、已经掌握复杂飞行技术，长期保证了飞行安全，在保卫祖国领空战斗中立了一等功的宋中文，光荣地被选为二级模范飞行员。
