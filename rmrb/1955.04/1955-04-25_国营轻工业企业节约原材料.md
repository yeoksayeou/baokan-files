State-Owned Light Industrial Enterprises Save Raw Materials

Enterprises affiliated with the Ministry of Light Industry have paid attention to saving raw materials and have improved the utilization rate of raw materials.

The brewing industry has widely used substitute raw materials. In the first quarter of this year alone, the state-owned Beijing and Tianjin wineries saved more than 1,600 tons of sorghum by using substitutes such as sweet potatoes, wheat bran koji, and grain bran. The papermaking industry saved high-quality timber by using red and white pine bark, small-diameter logs, reeds, rice straw, waste cloth cotton, shoe soles and uppers, waste hemp, and waste rope ends. According to statistics from the Shixian, Jilin, and Kaishantun pulp mills, more than 34,000 cubic meters of large-diameter logs were saved in the first quarter of this year, reducing cost expenses by half. The oil extraction industry promoted Li Chuanjiang's advanced operating method, and the oil yield continued to increase. For example, the state-owned Shanghai Oil and Grease Factory No. 1 discovered the law of steaming and baking time, and produced more than 18 tons of peanut oil and 9 tons of essential oil in the first quarter. The rubber industry improved technology and reduced the consumption of raw materials, which can save more than 590,000 yuan this year. In the cigarette industry, five state-owned cigarette factories alone saved more than 100,000 jin of tobacco leaves in the first quarter. In the first quarter, China Soap Company changed the original solid alkali to liquid alkali, saving more than 290,000 yuan in cost. (Bai Heng)

    国营轻工业企业节约原材料
    轻工业部所属企业注意节约原材料，并提高了原材料的利用率。
    酿酒工业广泛使用了代用原料。仅国营北京、天津两个酒厂，因使用甘薯、麸麯、粮糠等代用品，在今年第一季度就节约高粱一千六百多吨。造纸工业因使用了红白松板皮、小径原木、苇子、稻草、破布废棉、鞋底鞋帮、废麻及废绳头等，节约了上等木材。据石岘、吉林和开山屯三个制浆厂统计，今年第一季度节约了大径原木三万四千多立方公尺，使成本费用降低一半。榨油工业推广了李川江先进操作法，产油率不断提高。如国营上海油脂一厂摸到了蒸烘时间的规律，在第一季度多产花生油十八吨多，多产精油九吨。橡胶工业改进技术，减少原材料的消耗，今年可节约资金五十九万多元。卷烟工业方面，仅五个国营卷烟厂在第一季度就节约烟叶十万多斤。中国肥皂公司在第一季度中，将原用固体碱改用液体碱，节约成本费二十九万多元。　（白衡）
