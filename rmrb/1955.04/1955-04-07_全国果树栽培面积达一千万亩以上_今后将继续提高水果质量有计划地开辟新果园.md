The Ministry of Agriculture convened a national fruit tree production work conference from March 15th to April 2nd to study the principles and plans for developing fruit tree production.

China produces a wide variety of temperate and subtropical fruits. Before liberation, due to the devastation and destruction caused by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionary rule, most orchards were barren, and fruit production was greatly reduced. In the five years since liberation, various regions have implemented policies to protect and develop fruit tree production, and have carried out effective work in developing mutual aid and cooperation in fruit tree production, preventing and controlling fruit tree pests and diseases, and marketing fruit products. Therefore, the restoration and development of fruit tree production in China has achieved certain results in recent years. According to estimates from the conference, in 1954, the total area of various fruit tree cultivation in the country reached more than ten million mu, and the total fruit production was about three million tons.

The meeting held that: in order to meet the growing needs of the country and the people, it is necessary to vigorously increase the yield and quality of existing fruit trees with mutual aid and cooperation as the center, and to reclaim new orchards in mountainous areas and wastelands in a planned and active manner. The meeting specifically studied and drafted preliminary output targets for six major fruits, including citrus, apples, grapes, pears, bananas, and pineapples, from 1955 to 1957, as well as an outline for increased production from 1958 to 1962.

The meeting requested that all regions pay attention to the following tasks in developing fruit tree production: First, vigorously prevent and control pests and diseases, and improve cultivation techniques; second, cultivate seedlings in a planned manner to expand existing orchards and reclaim new orchards in mountainous areas and wastelands; third, strengthen organizational leadership, rely on and promote the development of mutual aid and cooperation in fruit tree production.

    全国果树栽培面积达一千万亩以上
    今后将继续提高水果质量有计划地开辟新果园
    农业部在三月十五日至四月二日召开了全国果树生产工作会议，研究了发展果树生产的方针和计划。
    我国出产多种多样的温带和亚热带的果品。解放前由于日寇和国民党反动统治的摧残破坏，大部果园荒芜，果品产量大大缩减。解放后五年来，各地贯彻了保护和发展果树生产的政策，在开展果树生产互助合作、果树病虫害防治、果品运销等方面进行了有成效的工作。因此，几年来我国果树生产的恢复和发展，已取得了一定的成绩。根据会议估计，一九五四年全国各种果树栽培总面积达一千万亩以上，果品总产量在三百万吨左右。
    会议认为：为了适应国家和人民日益增长的需要，今后应以互助合作为中心，大力提高现有果树的产量和果品质量，有计划地、积极地向山区、荒地垦辟新果园。会议具体地研究和草拟了柑桔、苹果、葡萄、梨、香蕉、菠萝等六种主要果品一九五五年至一九五七年的初步产量指标，以及一九五八年至一九六二年的增产轮廓。
    会议要求各地在发展果树生产中，注意做好以下几项工作：一、大力防治病虫害，改进栽培技术；二、有计划地培育苗木，向山区、荒地扩大现有果园和垦辟新果园；三、加强组织领导，依靠与促进果树生产互助合作的发展。
