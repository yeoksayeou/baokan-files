Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 24th: According to TASS, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, after studying the letter from the President of the Republic of Austria requesting amnesty for Austrians serving sentences in the Soviet Union for crimes committed against the Soviet people during the war, believes that, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the liberation of Austria from Hitler's rule by the Soviet Army and the restoration of the Republic of Austria, in order to promote the further strengthening of friendship and cooperation between the Soviet and Austrian peoples, it is possible to release 613 Austrian citizens serving sentences in the Soviet Union ahead of schedule and allow them to return to Austria.

    Regarding 74 convicted Austrian prisoners of war, in view of the fact that the relevant Soviet authorities believe that the crimes they committed on Soviet territory were serious and they cannot be released early and must continue to serve their sentences, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR has decided to hand over these people to the Austrian government as war criminals for handling.

    In addition, 39 Austrian citizens who were recently sentenced for frantically engaging in espionage activities against the Soviet Union for foreign intelligence agencies must remain in the Soviet Union to continue serving their sentences, and these people will be handed over to the Austrian authorities when the Soviet troops withdraw from Austria.

    最高苏维埃主席团对在苏联服刑的奥地利人作出决定
    新华社二十六日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科二十四日讯：苏联最高苏维埃主席团在研究了奥地利共和国总统要求赦免由于在战争期间犯有反对苏联人民的罪行而在苏联服刑的奥地利人的信件以后，认为在时值苏军把奥地利从希特勒统治下解放出来而使奥地利共和国复国十周年之际，为了促进苏奥两国人民的友谊和合作的进一步加强，可以提前释放在苏联服刑的六百十三名奥地利公民，并且容许他们返回奥地利。
    对于七十四名被判刑的奥地利战俘，鉴于相应的苏联机关认为他们在苏联领土内所犯罪行深重，不能提前释放而必须继续服刑，苏联最高苏维埃主席团决定：把上述这些人作为战犯移交给奥地利政府处理。
    另外三十九名因最近为外国情报机关猖狂进行反对苏联的间谍活动而被判刑的奥地利公民还得留在苏联继续服刑，这些人将在苏军自奥地利撤退的时候移交给奥地利当局。
