A factory manufacturing precision machine tools
The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, one of the key projects of China's First Five-Year Plan, has been put into production.

Measuring tools are used to determine the accuracy of products; cutting tools are used to cut metal and drill holes in metal. Both measuring and cutting tools are indispensable tools for the machine industry that manufactures airplanes, ships, automobiles, and locomotives. Before liberation, the precision tools needed by China's machinery manufacturing industry were all imported, and the quantity was very small. As a result, many machine-building factories did not have enough tools, and the precision of their products could not fully meet the standards. The commissioning of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant not only marks that China has its own precision tool manufacturing industry, but also means a further development of China's modern machine manufacturing industry.

Soviet expert Unuylov instructs workers in front of a profile milling machine.

Workers are conducting the first tests on the "Thousandth Comparator," which has an energy level of two thousandths.

The graduation machine in the gauge workshop is a highly precise machine that can accurately mark scales on gauges. Graduation worker Wang Shou-xue has been able to operate the graduation machine after only two months of learning in the graduation section. This is him practicing beside the protractor graduation machine.　　Xinhua News Agency manuscript, photo by Shang Shounian

Worker Zhang Shufeng meticulously examines various finished products with a microscope at the inspection station in the gauge workshop, ensuring that the products leaving the factory fully meet standard specifications.

The packaging work goes through six processes. Detailed work ensures that the products leaving the factory will not rust for a long time.

Under the enthusiastic guidance of Soviet experts, Tang Yong'an, a worker in the broach and milling cutter workshop, has been able to work independently. He can now produce more than ten kinds of products.

The precision tools produced by the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant have achieved good results in the use of the Beijing General Agricultural Machinery Factory. Workers believe that the domestically produced turning tools and drill bits have high hardness, accurate angles, and are durable. The picture shows workers in the double-wheel double-share plow workshop praising domestically produced drill bits. Lu Baoyu, a female worker in the thousandth shim section of the gauge workshop, is operating a "profile milling machine" here.

    制造精密机械工具的工厂
    我国第一个五年计划的重点工程之一——哈尔滨量具刃具厂已经投入生产了。
    量具是测定产品的准确程度用的；刃具是切削金属和在金属上钻眼用的。量具和刃具都是制造飞机、轮船、汽车和火车头等机器工业所不可缺少的工具。解放以前，我国机器制造业所需要的精密工具都是进口的，而且数量也很少。因而许多制造机器的工厂没有足够的工具，产品的精密程度也不能完全合乎标准。由于哈尔滨量具刃具厂投入生产，不仅标志着我国已经有了自己的制造精密工具的工业，而且意味着我国现代机器制造业的更进一步发展。左上图：哈尔滨量具刃具厂外景；右图：厂房内景。
    苏联专家格洛莫夫在量具车间里教导我国工人掌握最新式的精密车床。
    苏联专家乌努依洛夫在仿型铣床前指导工人工作。
    工人们对能量千分之二的“千分比较仪”进行初次试验。
    量具车间里的刻度机是种高度精密的机器，用它能够精确地在量具上刻出尺度。刻度工人王守学在刻度工部里，仅仅学了两个月的时间，已能操作刻度机了。这是他正在套角刻度机旁实习。　　新华社稿　尚舒年摄
    工人张树枫在量规车间的检查站内用显微镜缜密地检查各种成品。确保出厂的产品完全合乎标准规格。
    产品的包装工作要经过六个工序。细致的工作，保证出厂的产品经久不生锈。
    崭新的，完全合乎规格的各种量具和刃具的一部分。
    绞刀铣刀车间工人唐永安在苏联专家的热心指导下，已经能够独立工作了。现在他可以生产十种以上的产品。
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂所生产的精密工具在北京农业机械总厂的使用过程中，获得良好的效果。工人们认为国产的车刀、钻头硬度高、角度精确而且耐用。图中是双轮双铧犁车间的工人们正在赞扬国产的钻头。量具车间千分垫工部女工鲁宝玉正在这里操作“仿型铣床”。
