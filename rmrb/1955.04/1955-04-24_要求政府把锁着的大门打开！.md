    "Demand the Government to Open the Locked Gate!"
    By Our Correspondent Wang Xi
    On the day the Chinese Trade Delegation to Japan arrived in Osaka, a long red banner reading "Welcome to the Chinese Trade Mission" hung from the top of the eight-story Mitsui Bank building, dazzlingly bright in the warm sun.
    Osaka is the capital of the Kansai region of Japan and an important industrial and commercial center. The Kansai region is located on the west coast of Japan, across the sea from China. This is the economic heart of Japan, including major cities such as Osaka, Kobe, and Kyoto, with a population of nearly ten million people, and has a long history of economic and cultural exchange with China. The Kansai region has also accounted for a large proportion of trade between China and Japan after the war. We met many Japanese businessmen who could speak fluent Mandarin, Shanghainese, or Cantonese. The industry in the Kansai region produces various products, with heavy industries such as metal, machinery, and shipbuilding occupying an important position.
    The Chinese Trade Delegation to Japan received a warm welcome here and witnessed the eagerness of the industrial and commercial sectors and the general public to change the current state of not being able to trade freely with China.
    We visited the famous Hitachi Shipbuilding Company's Sakurajima Factory in Osaka. The equipment in this factory is already very old and outdated. Obviously, the factory has not increased investment for many years and cannot add new equipment. In the factory courtyard, the bulletin board posted the union's report to the workers about the factory's recent negotiations for orders. According to the factory director, Ichiro Shinoda, because of the small number of orders, the entire factory's equipment is only operating at 70% to 80% capacity. We saw two of the five shipyards were idle. The factory director told the Chinese delegation, "We will do our best to eliminate the restrictions of the embargo and allow trade with neighboring countries to develop." On the way back from the factory, an employee of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association explained to me: Because Japanese steel prices are high, the cost of shipbuilding is very high. In the past, the shipbuilding industry was subsidized by the government with profits from sugar trading. Now they are asking the government to "subsidize" the difficulties of high steel prices. The eagerness to find foreign markets for products, like that of the Sakurajima factory, is a common phenomenon throughout Japan.
    A few days later, at a dinner in Nagoya (part of the Tokai region), the deputy manager of the Chubu Prince Motors Company, Shuichi Hirazawa, who was sitting next to me, also complained about the high price of Japanese steel. He first inquired about China's need for automobiles. Then he told me that his factory produces 500 cars per month, and less than half of the products can be sold domestically. Because steel is expensive and there are no large orders, large-scale production cannot be carried out, so the product price is higher than the international market price. It is impossible to compete with British and American products when exporting to Southeast Asian countries. He said this is the fatal problem of the Japanese automobile manufacturing industry. "Then how can you reduce the price of your factory's products?" I asked him. He said, "I hope that the Japanese steel industry can import cheaper coal and iron ore from China, so that the price of steel will drop. This is not only the request of my factory, but also the common request of all metal machinery manufacturing industries in Japan." He added: If his factory could get orders from China, it could carry out normal continuous production, which would not be as difficult as it is now.
    Although Japan has more than 87 million people, the low purchasing power of the people makes entrepreneurs sigh in despair at the domestic market. An economist who investigated the Japanese steel industry told me that the average monthly wage of heavy industry workers, such as the veteran technical workers of the famous Yodogawa Steel Works, is only about 15,000 yen. With such a wage, it is difficult for a family of three to make a living. The average wage of a light industry worker is only about 8,000 yen. A university president told me that the employment rate of his school's graduates is only 50%. This is already a very good situation for a general university. According to him, the average employment rate of Japanese university graduates is about 30% to 40%. The vast majority of students have to engage in part-time jobs to supplement their living expenses and tuition fees during their studies. It is not surprising in Japan for university professors to act as guides for foreign tourists, or for university graduates to work as barbers.
    As for foreign markets? Due to the restrictions of the embargo, Japan's foreign trade has not only failed to recover to pre-war levels and keep pace with domestic production, but has also declined in recent years.
    We visited Kobe Port. This is Japan's largest port with modern docks, loading and unloading, and dry dock equipment. The water depth in the port ranges from 9 meters to 12 meters, and giant ships of up to 50,000 tons can dock directly. Within the long breakwater, the wind and waves are calm, and the entire port can accommodate 50 ships of more than 5,000 tons at the same time. Due to its huge throughput, Kobe Port was once known as the "Naples of the Far East." Before the war, trade with China accounted for 20% of the port's total trade volume. But due to the embargo and abnormal trade relations, as Katsumoto Sakamoto, the governor of Hyogo Prefecture (Kobe City belongs to Hyogo Prefecture), said: "Now, even 2% cannot be reached." The mayor of Amagasaki City, located between Osaka and Kobe, said: "It is a pity that many of the products produced in this city cannot be exported to China. The prosperity of Amagasaki City depends on the development of Sino-Japanese trade. I will work together with the 360,000 people of the city to eliminate artificial obstacles." The chairman of the Osaka City Council said: "I hope that China and Japan can travel freely. We demand that the government open the locked gate."
    The strong desire of the people from all walks of life in Kansai to develop trade with China is reflected in the current campaign for local assembly members being conducted throughout Japan. After arriving in Japan, we drove through the streets of various cities and often saw campaign propaganda activities. The streets were lined with "offices" for candidates from various parties—a small shop front covered with many white cloths bearing the name of the same candidate. Turning another street, there was another candidate's office from another party. Campaign trucks are on the streets every day. A striking large loudspeaker conveys the campaign platform of the candidate. We found that "expanding trade with China" is an indispensable common platform for most party candidates.

    “要求政府把锁着的大门打开！”
    本报记者　汪溪
    中国访日贸易代表团到达大阪那天，一条长幅“欢迎中国通商使节团”的红色标语，从三井银行八层大楼的顶端垂挂下来，在暖洋洋的太阳里，鲜艳夺目。
    大阪是日本关西地区的首府，日本重要的工商业中心，关西地区位在日本的西海岸，隔海和中国相邻。这是包括大阪、神户、京都等大城市拥有近千万人口的日本经济的心脏，和中国的经济文化交流有悠久的历史。战后中日两国之间的贸易，关西地区也占很大比重。我们遇到很多的日本商人能说流利的中国的国语、上海话或是广东话。关西地区的工业出产各种产品，金属、机械、造船等重工业占很重要地位。
    中国访日贸易代表团在这里受到了热烈的欢迎，看到了工商业界和广大人民要求改变目前不能自由和中国通商的状态的迫切心情。
    我们参观了座落在大阪的有名的日本日立造船公司的樱岛工厂。这个工厂的设备已经很陈旧落后了。显然是厂方多少年来没有增加投资，不能添置新的设备。工厂大院的布告栏里贴着工会向工人报告厂方最近接洽订货的消息。据厂长筱田一郎说，因为订货少，全厂设备只运用了百分之七十到八十。我们看到五个造船台中有两个闲着。厂长向中国代表团表示：“我们一定尽最大努力，消除禁运的限制，使和邻国的贸易可以发展起来。”在离开这个工厂的归途中，一位日本国际贸易促进协会的工作人员向我解释：因为日本钢材价格高，所以造船业的成本很高，过去造船业是靠政府以经营糖的利润补贴的。现在他们正在要求政府“补助”钢材价格高的困难。而像樱岛工厂这样迫切要求为产品找到国外市场的，在日本各地是普遍现象。
    几天之后我们在名古屋（属东海地区）的一次晚宴上，坐在我旁边的中部王子汽车公司的副经理平泽修一，也对日本钢材价格太高大发牢骚。他先向我打听中国需要汽车的情形。接着告诉我说：他的工厂月产五百辆汽车，产品在国内推销不了一半。因为钢材贵，又没有大批订货，不能进行大规模生产，因而产品价格比国际市场高。想向东南亚国家输出，是无法和英、美的产品竞争的。他说，这是日本汽车制造业的致命问题。“那么怎样才能使你厂出品价格降低呢？”我问他。他说：“希望日本的钢铁业能从中国进口比较便宜的煤和铁矿砂，钢材的价格才会下降。这不只是我的工厂，而且也是日本一切金属机器制造业的共同要求。”他又说：如果他的工厂，能得到中国的订货，就可以进行正常的连续生产，那就不致像现在这样困难了。
    日本虽然有八千七百多万人，但人民购买力的低下，使企业家们不能不对着国内市场望洋兴叹。一位调查日本钢铁业的经济学者告诉我，重工业工人、像著名的淀川制钢所的老技术工人，平均每月工资只在一万五千元左右。以这样的工资，要使一家三个人得以餬口是很困难的。一个轻工业工人的工资平均只在八千元左右。一位大学校长告诉我说，他的学校毕业生的就业率只有百分之五十。这在一般大学来说已是很好的情况了。据他说，日本大学毕业生的就业率平均约在百分之三十到四十。绝大多数学生在读书期间都要兼营副业贴补生活费和学费。大学教授当外国游览客人的向导，大学毕业生作理发师在日本并不是奇怪的事。
    至于国外市场呢？由于禁运的限制，日本的对外贸易，不但不能恢复到战前水平，无法和国内生产相适应，而且近年来还在衰落下去。
    我们参观了神户港。这是一个有着现代化码头、装卸和船坞等设备的日本第一大港口。港内水深由九公尺到十二公尺，五万吨以下的巨轮可以直接靠岸停泊。在漫长的防波堤内，风浪平静，全港能同时容纳五千吨以上的船舶五十艘。由于它具有巨大的吞吐量，神户港曾以“远东的那不勒斯”闻名于世。在战前，同中国的贸易占了这个港口贸易总金额的百分之二十。但是由于禁运和不正常的贸易关系，正如兵库县（神户市系兵库县所属）知事阪本胜说的：“现在，连百分之二也达不到了。”位在大阪、神户之间的尼崎市市长说：“本市生产的产品，许多不能出口供应中国，真是遗憾。尼崎市的繁荣有赖于中日贸易的开展。我将和全市三十六万人民一致努力，消除人为的障碍。”大阪市议会议长说：“希望中日两国自由来往。我们要求政府把锁着的大门打开。”
    关西各界人民的强烈要求同中国发展贸易的愿望，在目前日本各地正进行的地方议会议员的竞选运动中，反映了出来。在到达日本后，我们驱车驰过各城市的街道，常常看到竞选的宣传活动。街道上设立了各党派竞选人的“事务所”——一间小小的商店门面挂满了许多幅白布写着同一竞选人名字。转过另一条街，又是另一个党派竞选人的事务所。街道上天天都有竞选宣传卡车。一个惹人注目的大扩音喇叭，传达着竞选人的竞选纲领。我们发现，“扩大同中国的贸易”是大多数党派竞选人不可或缺的共同纲领。
