    Zhejiang tea farmers in seventy-three tea-producing counties are actively restoring abandoned tea plantations and developing new ones. According to statistics, twenty-two counties, including Taishun, Qingtian, Qingyuan, Yueqing, Yinxian, Shengxian, and Jiande, have restored more than 10,000 mu of tea plantations and developed more than 4,900 mu of new tea plantations. Many tea farmers have adopted advanced Soviet cultivation methods in the newly developed tea plantations. When the Yinglian Tea Production Cooperative in Guixiu Township, Shengxian County, cultivated tea trees, they used ropes to guide them, with each tea bush spaced one chi apart, so that the tea trees formed a straight line. The Meijiawu Tea Production Cooperative, which produces Longjing tea, took advantage of the time before the spring tea harvest to develop new tea plantations. All members organized small teams for clearing, gathering grass, and preparing the land, and developed nine mu of tea plantations in two days. The First Tea Production Cooperative in Sizhai Township, Zhuji County, after developing twelve mu of tea plantations, organized its members to go up the mountain to find wild tea seedlings. Within a few days, all the tea plantations were planted with tea trees. The tea farmers said happily: "In five years, we will have more black tea, green tea, and Longjing tea to supply the people of the whole country." (Zhang Jiazhi, Tu Zhengfeng)

    浙江茶农开辟新旧茶园
    浙江七十三个产茶县的茶农，正积极恢复荒芜茶园和开辟新茶园。据统计，目前已有泰顺、青田、庆元、乐清、鄞县、嵊县、建德等二十二个县恢复茶园一万多亩，开辟新茶园四千九百多亩。许多茶农在新开辟的茶园里采用了苏联的先进栽培方法。嵊县桂秀乡迎联茶叶生产合作社栽培茶树时，用绳子牵好，每茶蓬距离一尺，使一蓬蓬的茶树成一直线。出产龙井茶叶的梅家坞茶叶生产合作社利用采春茶前的空闲时间开辟新茶园，全体社员组织了开伐、拾草、整园小队，在两天内开辟了九亩茶园。诸暨县斯宅乡第一茶叶生产合作社开辟十二亩茶园后，又组织社员分组上山找野生茶苗，几天内茶园都栽培了茶树。茶农们愉快地说：“五年后我们就有更多的红茶、绿茶、龙井茶来供应全国人民了。” （张家治  屠正峰）
