Changzhi Special District Formulates Four Measures to Increase Production

    The Changzhi Special District in Shanxi Province has formulated four measures to increase production based on local conditions, including expanding the area of high-yield crops and replanting. After these four measures are implemented, the district's grain output this year is expected to increase by 100 million jin compared to last year.

    In Xiangyuan, Wuxiang, Qin County, Tunliu and other counties within the Special District, there is a lot of land and few people, and fertilizers are lacking. In the past, farmers planted most of their land with small black beans, which do not require fertilization and are labor-saving, resulting in very low yields. This year, due to the great development of agricultural producers' cooperatives, conditions are in place for rational use of land and organization of labor. The Commissioner's Office requires farmers in these areas to appropriately reduce the area of ​​bean fields and expand the planting of high-yield crops such as corn by 150,000 mu, without affecting the need for livestock feed and oil. This will increase the yield by at least 120 jin per mu compared to planting small black beans. In 1954, the district planted 700,000 mu of Golden Queen corn, with an average yield of 60 to 80 jin per mu more than local corn. This year, the entire district requires a further expansion of Golden Queen corn planting by 300,000 mu. These two measures are expected to increase this year's grain output by more than 36 million jin. In order to expand the planting area, the Commissioner's Office advocates adopting a two-crop-a-year system and a three-crop-in-two-years system, requiring an appropriate expansion of the area of ​​stubble crops after wheat fields, and intercropping black beans or soybeans and other crops in the autumn crop fields. At the same time, it also mobilizes farmers to actively reclaim wasteland, clear field boundaries, and improve silted river灘 land. These two changes in farming habits can increase grain production by more than 72 million jin this year.

    At present, farmers throughout the district are carrying out crop planning, preparing seeds, and accumulating fertilizer, striving to achieve this production increase plan. (Chang Rongfeng)

    长治专区制定四项增产措施
    山西省长治专区因地制宜地制定了扩大高产作物和复种面积等四项增产措施。这四项增产措施实现以后，全区今年约可比去年增产粮食一亿斤。
    专区内襄垣、武乡、沁县、屯留等县地广人稀，肥料缺少，过去农民把大部分土地都种上不用施肥又省工的小黑豆，因而产量很低。今年由于农业生产合作社有了很大发展，具备了合理使用土地和组织劳力的条件，专署便要求这些地区的农民在不影响牲畜饲料和油料需要的原则下，适当缩小豆田面积，扩种高产作物玉米十五万亩。这样每亩至少可比种小黑豆增产一百二十斤。一九五四年全区曾种了七十万亩金皇后玉米，平均每亩产量比本地玉米增产六十斤到八十斤。全专区今年要求再扩种金皇后玉米三十万亩。这两项措施约可使今年的粮食产量增加三千六百多万斤。为了扩大种植面积，专署提倡采用一年两作制和两年三作制，要求适当扩大麦田回茬作物，在大秋作物地内间作黑豆或黄豆等作物；同时，还动员农民积极开熟荒，打地界，改河道淤滩地。这两项耕作习惯的改变，可使今年再增产粮食七千二百多万斤。
    目前，全区农民正在进行作物规划、准备种籽、积肥等工作，争取实现这项增产计划。 （常荣峰）
