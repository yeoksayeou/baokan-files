Telegram to the Beijing Memorial Service for Martyrs such as Shi Zhiang:

    With boundless indignation, we express our deep condolences for the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the plane explosion on April 11th, perpetrated by American-Chiang Kai-shek special agents, and extend our heartfelt sympathy to their families. The cause of peace can never be undermined by vile conspiracies. The martyrs who sacrificed themselves for peace shall be immortal.
