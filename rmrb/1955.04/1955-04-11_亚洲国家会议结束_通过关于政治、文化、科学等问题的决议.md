The plenary session passed resolutions on political, cultural, scientific, economic, and social issues. The conference also passed an appeal presented by the religious representatives attending the meeting, calling for cooperation among followers of all religions in Asian countries for peace.

A large group of children from Delhi, accompanied by their teachers, congratulated the plenary session and presented paper flower garlands and ceramic toys to the presidium and the delegates.

Several women's groups in Delhi presented gifts to the conference on behalf of their organizations.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 10th: The Scientific Committee of the Asian Countries Conference held a meeting on the morning of April 8th, under the chairmanship of Professor Yevgeny Zhukov, Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Soviet representative, and Sahib Singh Sokhey, a prominent Indian scientist and the Indian representative, to discuss the issue of "Scientific Cooperation Among Asian Countries." On the evening of April 8th, the Scientific Committee, under the chairmanship of Professor Goro Tominaga (transliteration), Professor of Atomic Physics at the University of Tokyo and the Japanese representative, discussed the issue of "Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy." On the 9th, under the chairmanship of Ding Xilin, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Chinese representative, the committee continued to meet and discussed the issue of "The Destructive Uses of Atomic Energy."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 9th: All the delegates attending the Asian Countries Conference divided into five committees—political, economic, cultural, social, and religious—and held separate meetings on the morning of the 9th.

The Political Committee was chaired by Mrs. Rameshwari Nehru, the Indian representative; the Economic Committee was chaired by Professor Kobayashi, the Japanese representative; the Cultural Committee was chaired by Fakhri al-Akil, the Syrian representative; the Social Committee was chaired by Mrs. Tia Goonewardene, the Ceylonese representative; and the Religious Committee was chaired by Wu Yaozong, Chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Protestant Churches of China.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 9th: The Asian Countries Conference continued to hold a plenary session on the afternoon of April 8th. Sardar Gurmukh Singh Musafir, member of the Standing Committee of the Indian National Congress and the Indian representative, and Pak Jung-ae, head of the Korean delegation, took turns as chairmen.

U Hla Kyao, head of the Burmese delegation, spoke. He denounced the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits who invaded Burmese territory and condemned the Manila Treaty Organization. He said that the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits in Burma and the Manila Treaty Organization were direct threats to Burma's security and sovereignty. He said that Burma firmly believed in the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and that these principles were a guarantee of independence, security, and sovereignty.

Subsequently, the meeting discussed social and cultural issues.

Kaka Kalelkar, the Indian representative, gave a report at the meeting. He described the rich heritage of Asian culture. He said that the people of Asia must understand each other and study the cultures of various countries. Asia is the cradle of human civilization, and Asian culture is the richest. He called for efforts to revive Asian culture.

Chu Tunan, head of the Chinese delegation and president of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, said that Asian culture had made great contributions to the progress of mankind in the past. After reviewing the past cultural exchanges between the Chinese people and the people of other Asian countries, he said that these cultural relations between China and other Asian countries had been interrupted by imperialists. The consistent aim of the imperialists was to make the Asian people forget their own national cultures and impose foreign cultures on them. He then said that in recent years, not only has national culture been restored in so many Asian countries, but also the exchanges of cultural delegations between Asian countries have been resumed, which has greatly helped to strengthen mutual friendship, restore cultural relations, and enhance mutual understanding. He called for letting culture serve the people and further promoting cultural exchanges. He said that for peace, culture, and friendship, we must work together.

Professor Takudo Laikuma (transliteration), former member of the Japanese Diet and a Buddhist, spoke. He hoped to revive Asian culture. He read a telegram from the Japanese Institute for Religious Problems to the conference.

Mirzo Tursunzoda, a famous Soviet poet and the Soviet representative, spoke. He said that Asian culture is extremely rich and of great significance to friendship among peoples. He said that the Soviet people have made unprecedented progress in improving their living and cultural standards. He said that today in the Soviet Union, people widely read the works of writers from the People's Republic of China, Korea, Vietnam, India, and other countries, and they have a high appreciation for these works. Similarly, the works of Soviet writers also have a wide readership in Asia and other countries. He also said that the Soviet people constantly receive and send out cultural delegations.

Tursunzoda said that the culture of Asian countries is now threatened by atomic mania. However, the people of Asia are determined to seek peaceful coexistence and not to allow their countries to become bases for instigators of new wars. He said that the Soviet people are using atomic energy for peaceful purposes. The people of Asia want peace and a good life.

Abdul Karim Jahhor, a Syrian representative and member of the Syrian Parliament, spoke. He said that Arab culture had inherited the rich heritage of ancient Asian culture. He said that the growth of Arab national culture had been harmed by imperialists, who used many evil methods, one of which was to suppress the people and destroy their culture. The imperialists believed that the development of national culture was a threat to their existence. He finally advocated mutual exchange of cultural delegations and exchange of scientific knowledge.

Before the meeting adjourned, about forty women representatives from various women's organizations in Delhi—some with children—presented flower garlands to the presidium. At this time, the delegates and guests stood up and applauded and cheered enthusiastically. Two women representatives, Mrs. Currie and Mrs. Dasina, paid tribute to the representatives of the presidium and other representatives and assured them that the women of Delhi fully supported the conference's discussions for peace and Asian unity. Amid cheers, the women representatives of Delhi placed auspicious marks on the foreheads of the presidium members.
