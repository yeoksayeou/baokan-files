    Conscientiously Carry Out the Work of Streamlining Staffing and Simplifying Organizations

    Tightening the staffing of state organs and institutions, and simplifying organizations, are effective methods to save administrative expenses and overcome bureaucracy. Saving expenses can promote the accumulation of funds for national industrialization; overcoming bureaucracy can improve work efficiency and promote the smooth completion of various tasks. Therefore, tightening staffing and simplifying organizations is an important task that all organs in our country should constantly pay attention to.

    Our Party has always paid attention to the work of streamlining organizations. From the end of 1953 to the first half of 1954, the country conducted an administrative organization streamlining, and various levels of organs reduced more than 150,000 people. However, in that streamlining, some leading cadres of the organs did not sufficiently understand the significance of the streamlining work and did not well implement the spirit of the central instructions; at the same time, they did not combine the streamlining of organizations with the study of business, the improvement of leadership, and the improvement of work. Therefore, after the streamlining, many unreasonable phenomena in the organizational structure, staffing, and personnel allocation of many organs have still not been completely overcome; the problems of bureaucracy, red tape, and preoccupation with routine matters are still growing. Therefore, it is very necessary to conduct another more conscientious streamlining of staffing and simplification of organizations throughout the country this year.

    At present, the phenomena of large organizations, overlapping levels, uneven workload, and overstaffing are quite common in administrative organs and institutions at all levels. Of course, it is unavoidable that many organs have expanded their institutions accordingly due to the continuous development of their business and the increase of their tasks. However, in the central-level organs, some departments have exceeded actual needs in terms of institutional setup and staffing. Some institutions that should not be established or can be established or not established have been established; some institutions that can be large or small have been enlarged; the functional institutions of some departments are divided layer by layer, forming overlapping work and large organizations, which is obviously not right. Although some organs have fewer people, unreasonable phenomena in the organizational structure and staffing also exist. According to the preliminary inspection of some central organs recently, about one-third of the people in some units are idle or have very little to do.

    The excessive size of the leading organs and the accumulation of a large number of talents have in fact weakened the work of the grassroots units. Now some leading organs above the provincial and municipal levels are transferring people everywhere, even at the cost of drawing out all the capable cadres from the lower-level organizations. Of course, the enrichment of the leading organs requires the continuous transfer of some cadres from below. However, among the cadres accumulated in some leading organs, some are students who have just graduated from universities. They do not have practical work experience and are not suitable for working in leading organs. Some are still specialized technical personnel, but they are forced to change their professions and not use what they have learned. And at present, how much many factories, mines, basic construction departments, and other places need them, why do they have to be kept in the leading organs with nothing to do?

    There are also too many people who directly or indirectly serve in many organs, which is also very unreasonable. The administrative, personnel, general affairs, service personnel, and personnel of affiliated institutions such as nurseries and guest houses in many organs often account for about one-half of the total number of people. The phenomenon of administrative organs squeezing the staffing of enterprise organs is also very serious. For example, the administrative staffing of the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture is 217 people, but the expenses paid from enterprise profits and operating expenses have increased by 452 people.

    The above-mentioned unreasonable phenomena will inevitably cause serious economic losses to the country, which is incompatible with the requirements of economic construction. In the past few years, although the proportion of administrative management expenses in the total national expenditure has been relatively reduced year by year, from 19.3 percent in 1950 to 9.6 percent in 1954; this proportion is still not small. During the first five-year plan in the Soviet Union, this expense accounted for only 5 percent of the total national expenditure on average. If we can tighten the staffing of all organs, simplify organizations, save all redundant non-productive expenses, and reduce administrative expenses by another two-tenths (calculated based on the absolute figures in 1953), saving for five years can build an iron and steel complex including about 30 factories, which can increase the production of 3 million tons of steel annually. Therefore, every state worker, especially every leading cadre, should seriously consider how to save administrative expenses for the country, and should actively participate in and lead the work of tightening staffing and simplifying organizations.

    When the organization is tightened, the levels will be reduced, the redundant staff will also be reduced, the procedures for handling affairs will also be simplified, and the phenomena of bureaucracy and red tape will also be reduced. Those cadres who are only accustomed to abstract leadership will have to personally handle some major issues, which will also improve the quality of work. Moreover, after streamlining the staffing and simplifying the organization, exploring the experience of setting staffing quotas, there will be no idle people in the organs, every bit of strength can be used rationally, and everyone will work hard and the work of the state organs will advance by leaps and bounds. At the same time, after the streamlining of the higher-level organs, we can draw a large number of people to strengthen the lower-level organizations and the most needed work posts in factories, mines, and rural areas. The work of streamlining staffing and simplifying organizations has been initially launched in the central-level organs. The general practice is to adopt a method combining leadership and the masses, starting with in-depth inspection, finding out the unreasonable phenomena in the organization, staffing, and personnel use, and then linking the study of business, the improvement of leadership, and the improvement of work, and rationally setting the organization and staffing according to the principle of streamlining. A few departments that have progressed quickly have already set the organization and are studying the issue of setting the staffing. However, the progress of various organs is uneven, some leading cadres are not determined enough, and have not achieved the head's responsibility to personally do it, and some leading cadres still have various incorrect ideas and excuses, and have not actively led this work.

    Some people say: "Our cadres have a low level, and it is always better to have more people to handle affairs." This is a ideological obstacle that must be overcome in the streamlining work. Our state organs are not bureaucratic institutions, not empty shells; they are to serve the people effectively and do things for the people. In this way, we cannot blindly set up many people without asking about quality, without asking whether they are qualified or not, without asking whether they are needed or not. From the facts, is it really better to have more people to handle affairs? If an organ originally needs 100 people to work, but you insist on setting up 150 people, then the levels will naturally be complicated. When drafting an instruction, the minister often instructs the director of the bureau, the director conveys it to the director of the division, the director of the division then conveys it to the chief of the section, the chief of the section tells the clerk, the clerk drafts it, and it is sent up for review layer by layer. If there are any modifications, it is passed down layer by layer, and then sent up again. This complicated procedure does not make things easier, but makes them more difficult. Moreover, with overstaffing, some people will be emotional, which will of course affect the work. Besides, when there are more people, there will be more problems, and there will be more people to manage personnel and serve the cadres; offices, dormitories, canteens, and nurseries will also increase accordingly; the internal affairs of the organs that entangle the leading cadres will also increase; the time for leading cadres to seriously study the work and handle business work will also be reduced. This will definitely make things that are easy to handle become difficult to handle.

    Some people say: "We equip more cadres to cultivate talents for the country!" Of course, the country needs to cultivate a large number of talents. But in an environment of overstaffing, how can cadres get any cultivation and training? This environment will only frustrate the enthusiasm and creativity of cadres, and will only make them acquire bad habits of fatigue, procrastination, and laziness. Therefore, only by distributing the surplus cadres to the grassroots organizations that directly handle specific work according to their abilities, to the tense production posts, and to the places where they are most needed to work, can we cultivate a large number of excellent cadres for the country.

    Some people say: "The work is developing, and the current organization and personnel are for the preparation for future development." The work and business will inevitably develop, which is undoubtedly. It is also appropriate for the leading organs and leading cadres to appropriately take care of the development of work when considering the institutional setup and personnel allocation. However, it must be pointed out that the idea and practice of not starting from the current work tasks and actual needs, unilaterally or even blindly emphasizing future development, and not "setting up people according to things" but "setting up things according to people" are not in line with actual needs and violate the principle of streamlining and saving. Some people worry about the resettlement issue when they mention streamlining, and even affect their confidence in carrying out this work. It should be understood that this streamlining first requires the study of the business of the organs, determining the organization, determining the personnel, and then transferring all the personnel that can be transferred. Naturally, a group of capable and experienced middle and senior cadres should and must be adjusted in this process, and these people are of course very well allocated to work. As for the general cadres streamlined, they are also very much needed and welcomed by the vast grassroots units and production units. As long as they are placed in appropriate positions, each of them can fully play their role. Among them, some young cadres with a certain level of education and worker-peasant cadres with a relatively low level of education can also be sent to various schools and training classes to give them further training. This summer, a group of cadres with high school degrees will also be transferred from administrative organs at all levels to apply for various universities. At present, the central organs and various provinces and cities also have many intermediate or primary technical schools and cultural remedial schools, which can also plan to accommodate a large number of people who need to study. As for the few old, weak, and sick people, the state will of course formulate unified resettlement methods and take a serious and responsible attitude to properly handle them. These cannot be used as excuses to resist the streamlining work. Recognizing the great significance of streamlining staffing and simplifying organizations, eliminating various concerns, and doing a good job in streamlining is a major task for all organs at present.

    认真进行整顿编制精简机构的工作
    紧缩国家机关和事业机关的编制、精简机构，是节省行政开支和克服官僚主义的有效方法。节省开支又可以促进国家工业化的资金积累；克服官僚主义又可以提高工作效率，推动各项任务顺利完成。因此紧缩编制、精简机构，是我们国家一切机关经常应该注意进行的一项重要工作。
    我们党历来都注意整编工作。一九五三年年底到一九五四年上半年，全国曾整编过一次行政机构，各级机关精简了十五万余人。但是在那次整编中，有些机关领导干部对整编工作的意义认识不足，没有很好地贯彻中央指示的精神；同时也没有把整编机构同研究业务、改善领导、改进工作结合起来。所以整编以后，很多机关在组织机构上、编制上和人员配备上不合理的现象仍然没有得到彻底克服；仍然滋长着官僚主义、文牍主义和事务主义的毛病。因此，今年在全国范围内再进行一次比较认真的整顿编制、精简机构的工作是十分必要的。
    目前，在各级行政机关和事业机关中，机构庞大、层次重叠、忙闲不均、人浮于事的现象相当普遍。当然，很多机关由于业务不断发展，任务增多，机构相应地有所扩充是不可免的。但在中央一级机关中，有些部门在机构设置上和人员编制上，都超过了实际的需要。有些目前不应该设立或可设可不设的机构也设立了；有些可大可小的机构编大了；有些部门的职能机构层层分设，形成工作重复，组织庞大，显然是不应该的。有些机关虽然人数较少，但机构上编制上的不合理现象也同样存在。根据最近中央一些机关的初步检查，有些单位中三分之一的人闲着无事做、或者事情很少。
    领导机关机构过于庞大、积压大批人材，这就在事实上削弱了基层单位的工作。现在有一些省、市以上领导机关到处调人，甚至不惜把下级组织中得力干部抽光。当然，领导机关的充实，是要不断从下面抽调一些干部的。但是，在一些领导机关积压的干部中，有一部分是刚从高等学校毕业的学生。他们没有实际工作经验，不适合在领导机关工作，有的还是专门技术人材，但被迫改了行，所学非所用。而目前很多厂矿、基本建设部门和其他地方又多么需要他们，为什么偏偏把他们留在领导机关没有什么事作呢？
    还有许多机关中直接或间接服务的人员太多，这也是很不合理的。很多机关的行政、人事、总务、勤杂等人员和托儿所、招待所等附属机构的人员合在一起，往往占总人数的二分之一左右。行政机关挤占企业机关编制的现象也很严重。如黑龙江省农业厅行政编制是二百一十七人，但由企业利润和事业费中开支的又增加了四百五十二人。
    以上种种不合理的现象，必然使国家在经济上蒙受了严重的损失，这是和经济建设的要求不相容的。几年来，行政管理费的开支在国家总支出中所占比例虽是逐年相对减少，由一九五○年占百分之十九·三，减到一九五四年占百分之九·六；但是这个比例数仍然不小。苏联在第一个五年计划期间这项费用平均只占国家总支出的百分之五。假如我们能够紧缩一切机关的编制，精简机构，节省一切多余的非生产的开支，能够再降低行政开支的十分之二（以一九五三年绝对数字来计算），节省上五年，就能够建设一个包括三十个左右工厂的钢铁联合企业，每年可增产三百万吨钢铁。因此，每个国家工作人员，特别是每个领导干部，都应当认真地考虑如何为国家节省行政开支，都应该积极参加和领导紧缩编制、精简机构的工作。
    机构紧缩了，层次就会减少，冗员也会减少，办事的手续也会简化起来，官僚主义、文牍主义的现象也就会减少。那些只习惯于进行抽象领导的干部，也就不能不亲自动手处理一些重大问题，这样也会提高工作质量。而且整顿了编制、精简了机构，摸索出定员定额的经验，机关里没有一个闲人，每一分力量都能合理的使用，大家都紧张地努力工作，国家机关的工作就会日新月异地前进。同时在上级机关精简之后，我们就可以抽出大批人员去加强下层机构和厂矿、农村最需要的工作岗位。整顿编制、精简机构的工作在中央一级机关已初步展开了。一般的作法是采取领导与群众相结合的方式，首先从深入检查入手，找出机构上、编制上、人员使用上存在的不合理现象，然后联系研究业务、改善领导、改进工作，并按照精简原则合理地编定机构、编定人员。少数进行得快的部门已经定下机构，进而研究编定人员的问题了。但是各机关进行得不平衡，有的领导干部决心还不大，也未做到首长负责亲自动手，有的领导干部还有种种不正确的想法和藉口，没有积极领导这一工作。
    有人说：“我们的干部水平低，人多了总好办事”。这是整编工作中必须克服的一种思想障碍。我们的国家机关不是官僚机构，不是摆空架子的；是要切实有效地为人民服务，为人民办事的。这样，就不能不问质量，不问称职与否，不问需要与否，盲目摆设很多人。从事实上看，人多是否就真正好办事呢？一个机关工作本来需要一百个人做，你偏偏摆上一百五十人，这样，层次自然会繁多，起草一个指示，往往部长把精神指示给局长，局长传达给处长，处长再转达给科长，科长告诉科员，科员起草好了，一级一级送上去审阅，如有修改，再一层层传下来，然后再送上去。这种繁多的手续，不是使事情好办了，而是难办了。再说人浮于事，一部分人就要闹情绪，当然影响工作。况且人一多，问题就多了，管人事的，为干部服务的人就多了；办公室、宿舍、食堂、托儿所也要随着增加；纠缠领导干部的机关内部事务也增多了；领导干部认真研究工作处理业务工作的时间也就减少了。这样，一定会使好办的事情也变得难办了。
    有人说：“我们多配备些干部，是为国家培养人材呀！”当然，国家是需要培养大批人材的。但在人浮于事的环境里，干部怎能得到什么培养和锻炼呢？这种环境只会挫伤干部的积极性和创造性，只会使他们染上疲塌、拖拉、懒动脑筋的坏习气。因而，只有把多余的干部按照他们的能力分配到直接处理具体工作的基层组织里去，分配到紧张的生产岗位上去，送到最需要他们去工作的地方，才能为国家培养出大批优秀的干部来。
    有人说：“工作是发展的，现在机构多、人员多，是为将来发展作准备”。工作和业务必然要发展，这是毫无疑问的。领导机关、领导干部在考虑机构设置和人员配备上要适当地照顾工作发展也是应该的。但必须指出：不从当前工作任务和实际需要出发，片面地甚至盲目地强调将来发展，不“因事设人”、而“因人设事”的想法和作法，是不符合实际需要、违反精简节约原则的。有人一提整编，就耽心安置问题，甚至因此影响了进行这一工作的信心。应该了解这次整编，首先要求研究机关的业务，确定机构，确定人员，然后把一切可以调出来的人员都调出来。这中间自然应该而且必须调整出一批有能力有经验的中上级干部，这些人当然是很好分配工作的。至于整编出来的一般干部，他们也是广大的基层单位和生产单位十分需要和欢迎的。只要把他们安置到适当的岗位，他们每一个人都可以充分发挥作用。其中有些具有一定文化程度的青年干部和文化程度比较低的工农干部，还可以送进各种学校和训练班，给以培养深造。今年暑期还要从各级行政机关输送出一批具有高中程度的干部投考各类高等学校。目前中央各机关和各省市也都办有不少的中级或初级的技术学校和文化补习学校，也可以有计划地容纳大批需要学习的人员。至于少数老弱有病的人员，国家当然会订出统一的安置办法，采取严肃负责的态度来妥善处理。这些都不能作为抵抗整编工作的藉口。认清整顿编制、精简机构的重大意义，消除各种顾虑，作好整编工作，是各机关当前一项重大的任务。
