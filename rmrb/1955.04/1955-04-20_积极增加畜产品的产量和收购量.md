    Actively Increase the Production and Procurement of Animal Products
    Song Keqiang, Deputy Manager of China National Animal By-Products Import & Export Corporation
    With the development of animal husbandry in our country, the production and trade volume of animal products have greatly increased in the past five years. In 1954, the output of major animal products such as sheep wool, cashmere, goat skin, and feathers all increased significantly. However, due to the development of export trade and the growing needs of the domestic people, the speed of production development is far from keeping up with the speed of demand growth. Therefore, actively supporting the production of animal products, opening up sources of goods, saving consumption, and striving for more animal products for export have become important and urgent tasks for the state-owned animal products system.
    Our country is very rich in animal products and has natural conditions for developing animal husbandry. Our animal products are not only large in quantity and good in quality, but also have many varieties. Bristles, wool, cashmere, wool carpets, etc., have long enjoyed a high reputation in the international market. Our country has a vast land and abundant grasslands, with natural conditions for raising livestock. Not only are animal husbandry very developed in the Northwest, Southwest, Inner Mongolia, and Northeast, but also farmers in the inland provinces mostly regard animal husbandry as a major sideline, and these are all favorable conditions for developing animal husbandry. However, due to the limitations of transportation conditions and historical habits, animal husbandry in many areas is still developing slowly, and the natural conditions for raising livestock are not fully utilized. For example, the Bijie Special District of Guizhou Province has a grassland mountain of about two hundred li, but local farmers do not have the habit of raising sheep. There are many grasslands in Laiyang, Wendeng, and Huimin Special Districts of Shandong Province, but sheep raising is not common. Weining County of Guizhou Province has a grass sea of ​​800 hectares, which is also very suitable for raising geese and ducks, but no attention has been paid to its use. Other provinces have similar situations, which shows that we still have very favorable conditions for developing animal husbandry that can be fully utilized.
    In order to support the development of animal husbandry and expand the source of goods, state-owned trading companies, cooperatives, and agricultural and animal husbandry production departments that manage livestock products in various places should closely integrate and go deep into areas suitable for developing animal husbandry to help farmers and herdsmen use natural breeding conditions to raise livestock and poultry that do not require grain feeding and can supply people with meat and meet living needs. The supply of livestock and egg sources needed for development and the funds for initial trial breeding need to be facilitated and assisted by agricultural and animal husbandry production departments, food companies, animal products companies, cooperatives, and the National Bank at all levels. Grain departments need to help with some of the bran, chaff, and hulls used for livestock breeding and poultry hatching. In supporting production and cultivating sources of goods, it is also necessary to pay attention to cultivating excellent breeds, because only by cultivating and developing excellent breeds can we further improve the yield and quality of animal products. For example, the wool production of an improved breed of sheep is three or four times higher than that of an ordinary sheep, and the quality of a skin of an improved breed of rabbit is three or four times higher than that of an ordinary domestic rabbit. The white pigs in Longchang County, Sichuan Province, are of good quality, and white bristles are also priced high. Therefore, it is also very important to promote excellent breeds in a planned way where conditions permit. In addition to promoting excellent breeds, attention should also be paid to the seasonality of the purchase of wild animal skins. Because wild animal skins are generally more precious and production is seasonal, the quality of the skin will decrease or even become unusable after the season. To achieve this, hunters must be educated to hunt seasonally to reduce the production of inferior skins.
    In addition to actively supporting production and opening up sources of goods to fundamentally increase the production of animal products, going deep into production areas, organizing sources of goods, and increasing the amount of procurement are also important links in doing a good job in the supply of animal products. According to the situation in several regions in 1954, the procurement volume of animal products in our country can be greatly increased. For example, the procurement volume of miscellaneous skins in the Northeast region is less than 70% of the highest annual output in history; Qinghai Province organized more than 100 cadres last year to go deep into pastoral areas to find sources of goods, increasing the procurement volume of sheep wool by 2.21 million catties compared with 1953. The plan for the procurement of miscellaneous skins in the fourth quarter of 1954 in eighteen counties in the Gannan Administrative Region of Jiangxi Province was only one-quarter of the actual procurement volume. Many state-owned animal products companies in Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Northeast, Inner Mongolia, and other places have not been able to procure goods. Currently, the areas inhabited by Tibetans along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway are covered with patches of wool flying everywhere. Therefore, organizing forces and expanding sources of goods is a very important task at present. We require party committees and governments at all levels to supervise and assist local animal products companies in organizing forces from all aspects to go deep into procurement. While organizing sources of goods, it is also necessary to do a good job in the supply of materials. Without an adequate supply of materials, it is impossible to guarantee the expansion of sources of goods. Local animal products companies should actively cooperate with department stores, tea companies, trade companies, cooperatives, and grain departments to organize supply in a planned way in line with the production season of animal products. Since the institutions of cooperatives are relatively common, state-owned companies should help cooperatives expand procurement in terms of technology, management, and investigation of sources of goods. In areas without cooperatives, it is necessary to add necessary institutions or organize mobile teams seasonally to reduce the waste of animal products. At the same time, since animal products are mostly rural sideline products, some products such as feathers, bristles, and small miscellaneous skins are very scattered and easily discarded and wasted. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize social forces to collect animal products. In particular, rural housewives should be organized to pay attention to accumulating scattered animal products at ordinary times. At the same time, institutions, schools, and troops should also be organized to pay attention to collection. State-owned animal products companies should regularly collect from various places through cooperatives or vendors, and resell them to state-owned animal products companies after sorting. Attention should be paid to organizing local peddlers to help them overcome the difficulties of going deep into rural areas, and in conjunction with relevant departments, supply the necessary daily necessities, and collect scattered animal products through piecemeal exchanges to increase the income of farmers and herdsmen and reduce the waste of goods.
    In organizing procurement, it is also necessary to correctly grasp product specifications and prices, earnestly implement the spirit of the central government's price stabilization policy, and prevent the phenomenon of price increases and price suppression. State-owned companies should help cooperatives arrange prices in grassroots markets, correct the unreasonable prices caused by "price differences between cities and profits added by societies", and overcome the "better high than low" mentality in grasping product specifications and correctly implement the price policy.
    While organizing sources of goods, it is also necessary to properly arrange the market to prevent the waste of animal products. For industries engaged in the processing of animal products, it is necessary to give necessary arrangements through commissioned processing or other methods to eliminate the phenomenon of private purchase or panic purchase in the market. Since animal products are currently not the main necessities in people's lives, there are still conditions to save consumption to support exports. Some animal products, even those that are more needed for people's lives, can also be replaced by substitutes, selling lower-quality, low-value products domestically and exporting high-value, high-quality animal products in order to earn more industrial construction equipment. For example, the felt industry in northern provinces can use more cow hair and other waste hair as raw materials, and squeeze out as much wool as possible for export. According to calculations in Hebei Province alone, if all felt raw materials are made of pig hair down, more than 400,000 catties of wool can be saved for export each year, which can be exchanged for 35 tractors. If some leather products are replaced with pigskin instead of cowhide, then more than 1.1 million pieces of cowhide can be saved, which can be exchanged for the entire equipment of a seamless steel pipe factory on the scale of Anshan Iron and Steel. These illustrate that it is possible and necessary to tighten domestic sales to expand exports. We must actively organize sources of goods, save consumption, expand the export of animal products, exchange for industrial construction equipment, and support national industrial construction.

    积极增加畜产品的产量和收购量
    中国畜产公司副经理　宋克强
    随着我国畜牧业的发展，五年来畜产品的生产量和贸易额有了很大增加。一九五四年绵羊毛、山羊绒、山羊板皮、羽毛等主要畜产品的产量，都有显著增加。但由于出口贸易的发展和国内人民生活需要的不断增长，生产发展的速度还远跟不上需要增长的速度。因此，积极扶植畜产品生产、开辟货源、节省消费，争取更多的畜产品出口，就成为目前国营畜产系统重要而迫切的任务。
    我国是畜产品很丰富的国家，有发展畜牧业的自然条件。我国的畜产品不仅产量大、质量好，而且种类很多。猪鬃、羊毛和山羊绒、羊毛地毯等，在国际市场上素享盛名。我国土地广阔，草原丰盛，具有天然的饲畜条件。不仅在西北、西南、内蒙古、东北各地畜牧业非常发达，就是内地各省的农民也多以畜牧业为主要副业，这些都是发展畜牧业的有利条件。但由于交通条件和历史习惯的限制，目前很多地区的畜牧业还发展得较慢，对天然的饲畜条件利用不够。如贵州省毕节专区有一座约二百里路的草山，但当地农民却没有养羊的习惯。山东省莱阳、文登、惠民专区草原很多，养羊的也不普遍。贵州省威宁县有一处八百顷方圆的草海，也是很适合于饲养鹅、鸭的地区，但也没有注意使用。其他各省也有类似情况，这说明我们在发展畜牧业方面还有很优越的条件可以充分利用。
    为了扶植畜牧业的发展，扩大货源，各地经营牲畜产品的国营贸易公司、合作社和农牧业生产等部门，要密切结合，深入到适合于发展畜牧业的地区，帮助农、牧民利用天然的饲养条件来饲养不需要粮食喂养、又能供应人民肉食和生活需要的家畜、家禽。对发展生产中需要的畜种、蛋源的供应和开始试养时的资金等问题，就需要各级农牧业生产部门、食品公司、畜产公司和合作社、国家银行等给以方便和协助。在牲畜生养和家禽孵雏时所需要的部分麸、糠、谷壳等类饲料，需要粮食部门给以帮助。在扶植生产、培养货源中，还必须重视培育优良品种，因为只有培育和发展优良品种，才能更进一步提高畜产品的产量和质量。如一只改良种羊的羊毛产量，就比一只普通羊的羊毛产量高三、四倍，一张改良种兔子的皮要比一张普通家兔皮的质量高三、四倍。四川省隆昌县的白猪品质好，白鬃价格也高。因此有条件有计划地推广优良品种也非常重要。除了推广优良品种外，对野牲皮张的收购还要注意季节性。因为野牲皮张一般都较珍贵，生产有季节性，过了季节，皮的质量即降低，甚至不能使用。要做到这一点，就要教育猎户按季节打猎，以减少次皮产量。
    除了积极扶植生产、开辟货源，从根本上增加畜产品的产量外，深入产区、组织货源、增加收购量也是做好畜产品供应工作的重要一环。根据一九五四年几个地区的情况来看，我国畜产品的收购量还可大大增加。如东北区杂皮的收购量还不到历史上最高年产量的百分之七十；青海省去年组织了一百多个干部深入牧区寻找货源，使绵羊毛的收购量比一九五三年增加了二百二十一万斤。江西省赣南行政区十八个县一九五四年第四季度收购杂皮的计划仅为实际收购量的四分之一。在新疆、青海、甘肃、东北、内蒙古等地的很多畜产品国营公司没有能收购到。目前青藏公路沿途藏民住过的地带，都是毛片斑斑、遍地飞扬。因此，组织力量，扩大货源，是当前一项很重要的任务。我们要求各级党委和政府督促并协助各地畜产公司，从各方面组织力量，深入采购。在组织货源的同时，还要做好物资供应。没有适当的物资供应，就不可能保证扩大货源。各地畜产公司应主动同百货公司、茶叶公司、贸易公司、合作社和粮食部门配合，按照畜产品的生产季节，有计划地配合收购，组织供应。由于合作社的机构比较普遍，国营公司应该从技术上、经营管理上、调查货源上来帮助合作社，使合作社能扩大收购。在没有合作社的地区，要增设必要的机构，或按季节组织流动小组，减少畜产品的浪费。同时，由于畜产品多是农村副业产品，有些产品如羽毛、猪鬃、小杂皮等都非常零星分散，容易被抛弃浪费。因此，要动员社会力量来收集畜产品。特别应该组织农村中的家庭妇女在平时注意积累零星的畜产品。同时还应组织机关、学校、部队注意收集。国营畜产公司要通过合作社或小贩，定期到各处收集，经过整理后，再售给国营畜产公司。要注意组织各地的货郎担，帮助他们克服深入农村的困难，结合有关部门，供给必要的日用品，通过零星交换的形式，把分散的畜产品收集起来，以增加农牧民的收入，减少货源的浪费。
    在组织收购中，还要正确地掌握产品规格和价格，认真贯彻中央稳价政策的精神，防止抬价和压级压价的现象。国营公司应帮助合作社安排基层市场的价格，纠正由于“城城算差价、社社加利润”而造成价格不合理的现象，并要克服掌握产品规格中的“宁高毋低”思想，正确贯彻价格政策。
    在组织货源的同时，还要适当安排市场，防止畜产品的浪费。对从事畜产品加工的行业，要通过委托加工或其他方式给以必要的安排，消灭市场上的私购或抢购现象。由于畜产品目前还不是人民生活中的主要必需品，因而还有条件节约消费来支援出口。有些畜产品即便是对人民生活比较需要的，也可采用代用品的方法，把质量较次、价值低廉的产品内销，把价值高贵、质量较好的畜产品出口，以争取换回更多的工业建设器材。如北方各省的赶毡业，就可以多采用牛毛和其他废毛作原料，尽量挤出羊毛出口。据河北省一省计算，如果把赶毡原料都采用猪毛绒子，每年就可节约四十多万斤羊毛出口，可以换回拖拉机三十五架。如果把某些皮革制品用猪皮代替了牛皮，那末能节约牛皮一百一十多万张，就可换回鞍钢无缝钢管那样规模的无缝钢管厂的全部装备。这些说明紧缩内销来扩大出口是有可能的，也是必要的。我们一定要积极组织货源、节省消费，扩大畜产品的出口，换回工业建设器材，支援国家工业建设。
