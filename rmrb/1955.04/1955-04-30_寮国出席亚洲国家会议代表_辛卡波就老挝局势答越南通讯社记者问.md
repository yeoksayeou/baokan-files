Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 28th. Vietnam News Agency dispatch of April 25th: Colonel Sinka Po, the Lao representative to the Asian Countries Conference, received a reporter from the Vietnam News Agency on April 21st and answered the reporter's questions on the Laotian situation. The questions and answers are as follows:

	Q: At the first meeting of the Lao political conference, which reconvened on April 19th, the delegation of the Lao Royal Government proposed separating the Kingdom's troops in Sam Neua Province and Phongsaly Province from the Lao fighting forces. Colonel, can you tell us what this issue is about?

	A: This issue has been discussed many times in the Lao Joint Armistice Commission. The issue is this: The Lao fighting forces completely liberated Sam Neua Province in April 1953 and completely liberated Phongsaly Province in early 1954. By the day of the ceasefire, there were no French Federal forces or Kingdom troops in these two provinces. However, after the ceasefire on August 6, 1954, when the Lao side correctly implemented the Geneva Accords, withdrawing its troops from ten provinces and concentrating them in Sam Neua and Phongsaly provinces, the Lao Royal Government, according to the plans of US imperialism and with the approval and assistance of the French colonialist clique that was undermining the armistice agreement, attempted to resolve the Sam Neua Province and Phongsaly Province issue by military means, squeezing the Lao fighting forces out of their regrouping areas. On the one hand, the Royal Government colluded with remnant armed bandits hiding in the jungle, forcibly recruited youths from these two provinces, and put the label of "Kingdom Army" on them; on the other hand, it sent armed forces from Luang Prabang and Xieng Khouang by land or air to these two provinces to cooperate with the so-called "Kingdom Army," reoccupying several places, such as Muang Pan and Huai Tou in Sam Neua Province, and Ou Nua and Bang Tai in Phongsaly Province. The purpose of doing so was to prove that there were "existing" Kingdom troops in the aforementioned two provinces and to realize the conspiracy to divide these two provinces. The Kingdom side constantly dispatched troops to attack many places in Sam Neua and Phongsaly provinces to show that the simultaneous presence of the Lao fighting forces and the Kingdom forces in these two provinces often caused conflicts, thus suggesting the isolation of the armed forces of both sides in certain designated areas in these two provinces.

	The current suggestion of the Kingdom delegation regarding the isolation of armed forces in Sam Neua and Phongsaly also aims at dividing these two regrouping provinces of the Lao forces.

	Q: Colonel, what is your opinion on this issue?

	A: Our opinion on this issue has been stated in Prince Souphanouvong's statement on February 23, 1955: We firmly oppose all acts that undermine the armistice agreement and the conspiracy to gradually occupy Sam Neua and Phongsaly provinces by force.

	This is our firm and unwavering position.

	I believe that the only reasonable way to resolve the issue of isolating the forces of both sides is to strictly implement the Geneva Accords, which stipulate that Sam Neua and Phongsaly are the regrouping provinces of the Lao fighting forces before the political conference and general elections are held to achieve the unification of Laos.

	Q: What are your thoughts on the Royal Government's suggestion to establish Kingdom administrative institutions in these two provinces?

	A: I believe that the governments of these two provinces, both now and in the future, should fundamentally be the governments of the people. As we have repeatedly stated, we have always agreed to the principle that after the general elections are held to establish a coalition government, these two provinces should be placed under the supreme power of the Royal Government.

	Q: Colonel, what is your view on the Lao Kingdom's suggestion to first resolve the military and administrative issues of these two provinces and then deal with the issues of general elections and the rights and interests of the Lao side?

	A: I fully agree with the opinion of the Lao delegation that a political consultative committee must be established to resolve the main issues raised by the Geneva Agreement, such as free general elections, constitutionally stipulated people's democratic freedoms, the issue of non-discrimination against those who participated in the patriotic war, and, of course, the issue of Sam Neua Province and Phongsaly Province mentioned in Prince Souphanouvong's statement. As for the Kingdom side's use of military force to resolve the issues of these two provinces, this is a complete violation of the Geneva Accords and also violates the wishes of the Lao people. Therefore, we strongly protest against this practice.

	We need to cooperate with the Royal Government on the basis of respecting and correctly implementing the Geneva Accords. As for our own interests, we believe that the interests of "Issala" and the interests of the Lao people are completely consistent. We only hope for peace, democracy, independence, and unity.

	Q: What do you think is the prospect of the reconvened political conference?

	A: If the patriotic and progressive people in the current Royal National Assembly and the Royal Government break free from the conspiracy of US imperialism, consider and act in accordance with the wishes of the Lao people, recognize the ardent patriotism of the Lao fighting forces and their significant contribution to national liberation, and thus sincerely cooperate with the Lao fighting forces and negotiate with them on an equal footing, then the conference will have good prospects.

	As for the Lao side, we firmly maintain our goodwill, place the interests of the motherland above all interests, and wholeheartedly strive to make the negotiations a success.

    寮国出席亚洲国家会议代表
    辛卡波就老挝局势答越南通讯社记者问
    新华社河内二十八日电　越南通讯社二十五日讯：寮国出席亚洲国家会议代表辛卡波上校在四月二十一日接见了越南通讯社记者，就老挝局势回答了记者的问题。问答如下：
    问：在四月十九日复会的老挝政治会议的第一次会议上，老挝王国政府代表团提出了把在桑怒省和丰沙里省的王国方面的部队同寮国战斗部队隔离开来的建议。上校，你能否告诉我们这个问题是怎么回事？
    答：这个问题过去在老挝联合停战委员会上曾经多次讨论过，问题是这样：寮国战斗部队在一九五三年四月就全部解放了桑怒省，在一九五四年年初全部解放了丰沙里省。到停火那天，在这两省里已经没有任何法兰西联邦部队或王国军队。但在一九五四年八月六日停战以后，当寮国方面正确履行日内瓦协定，把它的部队从十个省撤出并向桑怒和丰沙里两省集结时，老挝王国政府方面按照美帝国主义的计划并在破坏停战协定的法国殖民分子集团的赞同和帮助下，企图用军事手段解决桑怒省和丰沙里省问题，把寮国战斗部队挤出他们的集结区。王国政府一方面纠合潜伏在丛林中的残余武装土匪，强迫征募这两省的青年，给他们挂上“王国军队”的牌子；另一方面，它又从琅勃剌邦和川圹经陆路或空投把武装部队送往这两省，同所谓的“王国军队”配合，重新侵占了几处地方，例如桑怒省的芒奔和会头，丰沙里省的乌怒和邦太。这样做的目的在于证明在上述两省有王国部队“存在”，在于实现分割这两个省份的阴谋。王国方面不断派遣军队攻击桑怒和丰沙里省的许多地方，以表明寮国战斗部队和王国部队在这两个省份的同时存在时常造成冲突，从而建议在这两省的某些指定的地区隔离双方的武装部队。
    王国代表团目前的关于隔离在桑怒和丰沙里的武装部队的建议的目的，还在于分割寮国部队的这两个集结省份。
    问：上校，你对于这个问题的意见是什么？
    答：我们对这个问题的意见已在苏发努冯亲王在一九五五年二月二十三日的声明中说明了：我们坚决反对一切破坏停战协定的行为和利用武力逐步侵占桑怒和丰沙里两省的阴谋。
    这就是我们的坚定不移的立场。
    我认为，解决隔离双方部队问题的唯一的合理办法就是严格执行日内瓦协定，这个协定规定，在举行政治会议和普选以实现老挝的统一以前，桑怒和丰沙里是寮国战斗部队的集结省份。
    问：你对于王国政府关于在这两个省份建立王国行政机构的建议有何想法？
    答：我认为，这两个省份的政府在现在以及在将来，都应当根本上是人民的政府。正如我们多次申明的，我们始终同意这样一个原则，就是在举行普选成立联合政府后，这两个省份应当置在王国政府最高权力之下。
    问：上校，你对于老挝王国方面关于首先解决这两省的军事和行政问题然后处理普选和寮国方面的权益问题的建议的看法如何？
    答：我完全同意寮国代表团的意见，即必须成立政治协商委员会来解决日内瓦协议所提出的主要问题，如自由普选、宪法规定的人民民主自由、对曾参加爱国战争者不予歧视的问题、自然还有苏发努冯亲王声明中所提到的桑怒省和丰沙里省的问题。关于王国方面用军事力量来解决这两个省的问题，这是完全违反日内瓦协定的，也是违反老挝人民的愿望的。因此，我们强烈地抗议这种做法。
    我们需要在尊重和正确执行日内瓦协定的基础上和王国政府合作。至于我们自己的利益，我们认为“伊萨拉”的利益和老挝人民的利益是完全一致的。我们只希望和平、民主、独立和统一。
    问：你认为复会的政治会议的前途如何？
    答：如果现在王国国民议会和王国政府中的爱国进步人士摆脱了美帝国主义的阴谋，按照老挝人民的愿望进行考虑和行动，承认寮国战斗部队热烈的爱国主义和它对民族解放的重大贡献，从而真诚地同寮国战斗部队合作并在平等的基础上和他们进行谈判，那末会议就会有良好的前途。
    至于寮国方面，我们坚定不移地保持着我们的善意，把祖国的利益置于一切利益之上，并全心全意地努力使谈判成功。
