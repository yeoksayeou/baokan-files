The Geneva Accords Must Be Fully Implemented
Ma Fang

According to the Geneva Accords and the recent protocols reached between Vietnam and France, the Vietnam People's Army took over the Haiphong area from April 22nd to May 16th, while completing the withdrawal of the Vietnam People's Army from the Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh areas. This is a new achievement in the implementation of the Geneva Accords. This achievement is the result of the resolute struggle of the Vietnamese people, with the broad support of peace-loving people all over the world and countries concerned about peace in Indochina, for the full implementation of the Geneva Accords.

The American aggressor clique was very annoyed by the implementation of the agreement on the transfer of the Haiphong area, considering it a heavy blow to the American conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Accords. As everyone knows, the American aggressor clique has tried every possible means to obstruct the Vietnamese and French sides from reaching an agreement on the handover of the Haiphong area, and colluded with the French Union forces to illegally transport and destroy machinery and public property in the Haiphong area, and instigated the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to massively abduct residents of Haiphong. The US Naval Headquarters openly dispatched US warships to participate in the abduction of North Vietnamese residents, and US special envoy to South Vietnam, Collins, even personally went to Haiphong to "inspect" the abduction activities.

Even after the agreement on the transfer of Haiphong was reached, American interference activities continued; the illegal acts of the French Union forces and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in abducting residents and destroying public property in Haiphong did not stop. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique even openly demanded the revision of the Geneva Accords in order to continue illegally coercing residents to move south indefinitely.

According to a document issued by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attending the Asian-African Conference on April 22, the purpose of the plan to abduct North Vietnamese residents, which was planned single-handedly by the United States, is to recruit soldiers for the South Vietnamese authorities' army militarily; to recruit labor for the southern plantations economically; and to slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam politically in order to cover up its shameless conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Accords. Therefore, such criminal activities that violate the Geneva Accords must not be allowed to continue. The French Union forces must earnestly take responsibility to ensure the implementation of all the clauses of the protocol on the transfer of Haiphong.

The transfer of Haiphong and other areas marks the end of the military regrouping and transfer stage in Vietnam, and the implementation of the Geneva Accords has taken another step forward. The International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam has made its contribution in this regard. And the American conspiracy to undermine the work of the International Commission has been defeated.

However, it must be pointed out that the American conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Accords in various ways has not only not stopped, but is being intensified. Recently, the United States has been actively equipping and training armed forces in South Vietnam that are completely at its disposal, and has been intensifying its interference in South Vietnam's internal affairs; creating chaos in South Vietnam and expanding the terror rule that strangles the basic freedoms of the South Vietnamese people. These are all serious violations of the Geneva Accords. In particular, the United States is setting up various obstacles to obstruct and undermine the Vietnamese elections.

According to the provisions of the Geneva Accords, Vietnam and France should begin consultations on July 20 this year to arrange for the general election in July next year to achieve the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. Pham Van Dong, head of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the Asian-African Conference, pointed out: "A new period is about to begin, in which the issue of unifying Vietnam through free general elections must be resolved. Vietnam is a unified country, and no one can split it."

However, US Secretary of State Dulles openly stated on March 8 that he would imitate the despicable means used by the United States to obstruct the unification of Korea and Germany to create a split in Vietnam. On April 4, the American "Time" magazine revealed that the United States and South Vietnam might "create excuses to postpone or completely evade the election." The Ngo Dinh Diem clique also echoed and clamored for "postponing the election." The South Vietnamese representative even openly attacked the Geneva Accords at the Asian-African Conference, and even described the Geneva Accords, which are the victorious fruit of the Vietnamese people's struggle for peace, unification, independence, and democracy, as "constantly harming his country." Obviously, what he cares about is completely incompatible with the national and peaceful interests of the Vietnamese people.

All these activities of the United States to undermine the Geneva Accords are making the Indochina situation increasingly serious, which cannot but arouse close attention from all parties. The Vietnamese people are determined to work hard for the full implementation of the Geneva Accords. Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong recently reiterated: The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are determined to strictly and fully implement the Geneva Accords. They have always maintained close cooperation with the International Supervisory and Control Commission and have given the commission all assistance to help it complete its tasks. The Vietnamese people's struggle to safeguard the Geneva Accords has won the sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world and countries concerned about the Indochina situation. Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong recently reaffirmed their support for the Geneva Accords during their talks, and believed that holding free elections and achieving Vietnamese unification in accordance with the Geneva Accords is important. The joint communique of the talks between Burmese Prime Minister U Nu and Pham Van Dong also unanimously agreed that the Geneva Accords must be faithfully implemented to achieve a satisfactory solution to the political issues of the three Indochinese countries. This is of great significance for maintaining the Geneva Accords and consolidating peace in Indochina.

The Chinese people firmly support the efforts of the Vietnamese people and countries concerned about peace in Indochina. All activities of the United States to undermine the Geneva Accords must be stopped. The Geneva Accords must be fully implemented.

    日内瓦协议必须全部实施
    马方
    根据日内瓦协议和最近越法双方达成的议定书，自四月二十二日至五月十六日，越南人民军接管海防地区，同时完成越南人民军从广义、平定地区的撤退工作。这是执行日内瓦协议的一个新的成就。这个成就是越南人民在全世界爱好和平人民及关心印度支那和平的国家的广泛支持下，为日内瓦协议的完全实施而进行坚决斗争的结果。
    美国侵略集团对于移交海防地区的协议的执行，感到十分恼怒，认为这是对美国破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋的一个沉重打击。大家知道，美国侵略集团曾千方百计地阻挠越法双方达成有关交接海防地区的协议，并勾结法兰西联邦部队非法地运走和破坏海防地区的机器和公共财产，指使吴庭艳集团大批地劫运海防居民。美国海军总部公然派遣美国舰只参与劫夺北越居民，美国驻南越特使柯林斯还曾亲自到海防“视察”劫运活动。
    就在移交海防的协议达成之后，美国的干涉活动仍在进行；法兰西联邦部队和吴庭艳集团在海防劫夺居民和破坏公共财产的非法行为也没有停止。吴庭艳集团甚至公开要求修改日内瓦协定，以便无限期地继续非法胁迫居民南迁。
    据四月二十二日出席亚非会议的越南民主共和国代表团发表的文件指出：美国一手策划的劫夺北越居民的计划，其目的，在军事上是为南越当局的军队征集兵士；在经济上，是为南部的种植园征募劳动力；在政治上，是污蔑越南民主共和国，以掩盖它破坏日内瓦协定的无耻阴谋。因此，决不能再容许这种违反日内瓦协定的罪恶活动继续下去了。法兰西联邦部队必须切实负起责任，保证移交海防议定书的全部条款的实施。
    海防等地区的移交，标志着在越南军事集结和移交阶段的告终，日内瓦协议的执行又向前推进了一步。越南国际监督和监察委员会在这方面作出了它的贡献。而美国一直企图破坏国际委员会的工作的阴谋活动，已经遭受失败。
    但是，必须指出，美国从各个方面破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋活动不但没有停止，而且正在加紧进行。最近，美国在南越积极装备和训练完全供它驱使的武装部队，变本加厉地干涉南越内部事务；制造南越的混乱局面，扩大扼杀南越人民基本自由的恐怖统治。这都是对日内瓦协议的严重违反。特别是美国正在布置种种障碍，来阻挠和破坏越南的选举。
    根据日内瓦协议的规定，法越双方在今年七月二十日起就应开始协商，安排明年七月的普选，以实现越南的和平统一。越南民主共和国出席亚非会议代表团团长范文同指出：“一个新的时期即将开始，在这个时期中，关于通过自由的普选来统一越南的问题必须加以解决。越南是一个统一的国家，任何人都不能分裂它。”
    但是，美国国务卿杜勒斯在三月八日公然声言要仿效美国阻挠朝鲜和德国的统一的卑鄙手段，来制造越南的分裂。四月四日美国“时代”周刊透露，美国和南越可能“制造借口来推迟、或是根本推脱选举”。吴庭艳集团也在应声叫嚷要“延期选举”。南越代表甚至在亚非会议上公开攻击日内瓦协议，竟把这个越南人民争取和平、统一、独立和民主的斗争的胜利成果的日内瓦协议，说成是“一直在损害他的国家”。显然，他所关心的同越南人民的民族利益和和平利益是毫不相容的。
    美国这一切破坏日内瓦协议的活动，使印度支那局势日益严重，这不能不引起各方的密切注视。越南人民是有决心为日内瓦协定的全部实施而努力的，范文同副总理最近又重申：越南人民和越南民主共和国政府决心要严格地和充分地履行日内瓦协定。他们始终同国际监督和监察委员会进行紧密的合作，并且给委员会以一切协助，以帮助它完成任务。越南人民这种维护日内瓦协议的斗争，已经得到了全世界爱好和平的人民和关心印度支那局势的各国的同情和支持。印度总理尼赫鲁和越南民主共和国副总理兼外长范文同在最近的会谈中，一致重申支持日内瓦协议，并认为根据日内瓦协议举行自由选举和实现越南统一是重要的。缅甸总理吴努和范文同的会谈公报也一致认为必须忠实履行日内瓦协议，使印度支那三国的政治问题获得令人满意的解决。这对于维护日内瓦协议、巩固印度支那的和平是有重要意义的。
    中国人民坚决支持越南人民和关心印度支那和平的国家的这种努力。美国破坏日内瓦协议的各种活动必须被制止。日内瓦协议必须全部实施。
