Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, April 19th.

Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates:

My main speech has been printed and will soon be distributed to everyone. After listening to the speeches of many delegation leaders, I would like to make some supplementary remarks.

The Chinese delegation came here to seek unity, not to quarrel. We communists do not hide the fact that we believe in communism, and we believe that the socialist system is a superior system. At this conference, there is no need to promote our own ideology and the political system of our own country, although there are indeed differences among us.

The Chinese delegation came here to seek a common ground, not to create divisions. Is there any basis for seeking common ground among us? Yes, there is a basis. The vast majority of Asian and African countries and peoples have suffered and are still suffering from the scourge of colonialism. This is something we all acknowledge. If we seek a common ground to escape the pain and disaster under colonial rule, we will very easily understand and respect each other, sympathize with and support each other, rather than suspect and fear each other, exclude and oppose each other. That is why we agreed to the four purposes of the Asian-African Conference announced by the five prime ministers of the Bogor Conference without making any other suggestions.

As for the tense situation created single-handedly by the United States in the Taiwan area, we could have put forward a proposal like the one proposed by the Soviet Union, seeking a solution through an international conference, for the conference to consider. The will of the Chinese people to liberate their territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands is just. This is entirely a matter of our internal affairs and the exercise of our sovereignty. This just demand of ours has won the support of many countries. We could also have raised the issue of the recognition and restoration of the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations for the conference to consider. The Bogor Conference held last year by the five prime ministers of Colombo supported the restoration of the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. Other Asian and African countries also support this proposition. In addition, we could have criticized here the United Nations' unjust treatment of China. But we have not done any of this, because otherwise, our conference would be dragged into disputes over all these issues, and no solution could be reached.

At our conference, we should seek our common ground while retaining our differences. As for our common ground, the conference should affirm all our common aspirations and demands. This is our main task here. As for our differences, no one among us is asked to give up his own views, because differences of opinion are an objective reality. However, we should not let our differences prevent us from reaching agreement on our main task. We should try to understand and appreciate our differing opinions on the basis of our common ground.

Now, first of all, I would like to talk about the issue of different ideologies and social systems. We must admit that there are indeed different ideologies and different social systems among our Asian and African countries. But this cannot prevent us from seeking common ground and uniting. Since the Second World War, many independent countries have emerged. One category is countries led by communists, and the other is countries led by nationalists. The first category of countries is not many. However, some people do not like the fact that 600 million Chinese people have chosen a socialist political system led by the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese people are no longer ruled by imperialists. The second category of countries is larger in number, such as India, Burma, Indonesia, and many other countries in Asia and Africa. Both of these types of countries have gained independence from colonial rule and are continuing to struggle for complete independence. Is there any reason why we cannot understand and respect each other, support and sympathize with each other? There is every reason to make the Five Principles the foundation for establishing friendly, cooperative, and good-neighborly relations between us. Asian and African countries, including China, are economically and culturally backward. Since our Asian-African Conference does not exclude anyone, why can't we understand each other and engage in friendly cooperation?

Secondly, I would like to talk about the issue of whether there is freedom of religious belief. Freedom of religious belief is a principle recognized by all modern countries. We communists are atheists, but we respect all people who have religious beliefs. We hope that those who have religious beliefs can also respect those who do not have religious beliefs. China is a country with freedom of religious belief. China not only has seven million communists, but also tens of millions of Muslims, Buddhists, and millions of Christians and Catholics. Among the Chinese delegation here is a devout Ahong who believes in Islam. This situation does not hinder China's internal unity. In the big family of Asian and African countries, why can't people with religious beliefs unite with people without religious beliefs? The days of inciting religious disputes should be over, because those who benefit from inciting such disputes are not among us.

Thirdly, I would like to talk about the issue of so-called subversive activities. The Chinese people's struggle against colonialism has been going on for more than a hundred years. The national democratic revolutionary struggle led by the Chinese Communist Party only achieved final victory after a process of thirty years of hardship. It is impossible to describe all the suffering the Chinese people endured under the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and Chiang Kai-shek. Finally, the Chinese people chose their national system and the current government. The victory of the Chinese revolution was due to the efforts of the Chinese people. Certainly, it was not imported from the outside. Even those who dislike the victory of the Chinese revolution cannot deny this. There is a Chinese proverb that says, "Do not do unto others what you do not want done unto you." We are against foreign interference; how could we want to interfere in the internal affairs of others? Some people say that there are more than ten million overseas Chinese, and their dual nationality may be used for subversive activities. However, the issue of dual nationality is a legacy of the old China. Until now, Chiang Kai-shek is still using a small number of overseas Chinese to carry out subversive activities against the countries where they reside. However, the People's Government of New China is willing to solve the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese with the governments of the countries concerned. Some people also say that China's Dai Autonomous Region is a threat to others. There are dozens of ethnic minorities in China, with a population of more than 40 million. The Dai people and the Zhuang people, who have the same origin as the Dai people, have nearly 10 million people. Since they do exist, we must give them the right to autonomy. Just as Burma has a Shan State, every ethnic minority in China has its autonomous region. How can the exercise of their autonomous rights by ethnic minorities in China within China be said to be a threat to our neighbors?

We are now prepared to establish normal relations with all Asian and African countries, with all countries in the world, especially with our neighbors, on the basis of strict adherence to the Five Principles. The problem now is not that we are carrying out subversive activities against the governments of other countries, but that someone is building bases around China in order to carry out subversive activities against the Chinese government. For example, on the border between China and Burma, there are indeed remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek clique who are carrying out sabotage activities against both China and Burma. Because of the friendly relations between China and Burma, and because we have always respected Burma's sovereignty, we believe that the Burmese government can solve this problem.

The Chinese people have chosen and support their own government. China has freedom of religious belief. China has no intention of subverting the governments of its neighbors. On the contrary, China is suffering from the naked and open subversive activities of the United States of America. Anyone who does not believe this can go to China or send people there to see for themselves. We know that those who do not yet know the truth have doubts in their hearts. There is a Chinese saying: "Seeing is believing." We welcome representatives from all the countries participating in this conference to visit China at any time. We don't have a bamboo curtain, but someone is spreading a smokescreen between us.

The 1.6 billion people of Asia and Africa hope that our conference will be successful. All countries and peoples in the world who hope for peace are looking forward to the conference making a contribution to expanding the area of peace and establishing collective peace. Let us Asian and African countries unite and make our best efforts to make the Asian-African Conference a success.

### 在亚非会议十九日下午全体会议上  周恩来总理的补充发言

    在亚非会议十九日下午全体会议上
    周恩来总理的补充发言主席先生，各位代表：
    我的主要发言已经油印出来，即将分发给大家。在听了许多代表团团长的发言后，我想作一些补充发言。
    中国代表团到这里来是为了寻求团结，而不是为了争吵。我们共产党人并不隐瞒，我们是信仰共产主义的，我们认为社会主义制度是一种优良的制度。在这个会议上，没有必要来宣扬自己的思想体系和自己国家的政治制度，虽然我们之间确实存在着分歧。
    中国代表团到这里来是为了寻求共同的基础，不是为了制造分歧。在我们之间寻求共同的基础是否有任何根据呢？是的，是有根据的。亚非国家和人民中的绝大多数都曾经遭受过、并且仍然遭受着殖民主义的灾难。这一点是我们大家全都承认了的。如果我们寻求摆脱殖民主义统治下的痛苦和灾难的共同基础，我们将非常容易互相了解和尊重、互相同情和支持，而不是互相猜疑和恐惧、互相排斥和对立。这就是我们为什么同意茂物会议五国总理所宣布的亚非会议的四个目的而不提出任何其他建议的缘故。
    至于美国在台湾地区所一手造成的紧张局势，我们本来可以提出像苏联所提出的通过国际会议来谋求解决的建议那样一个项目，供会议审议。中国人民解放自己的领土台湾和沿海岛屿的意志是正义的。这完全是我国内政和行使我国主权的问题。我们的这一正义要求已经赢得了许多国家的支持。我们本来还可以提出承认和恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位问题，供会议审议。科伦坡五国总理去年举行的茂物会议支持恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位。其他亚洲和非洲的国家也支持这种主张。此外，我们本来还可以在这里批评联合国对中国的不公正待遇。但是，这一切我们都没有做，因为不然的话，我们的会议会被拖到关于这一切问题的争执中去，而得不出任何解决办法。
    在我们的会议上，我们应该寻求我们的共同基础，同时保留我们的不同点。至于我们的共同基础，会议应该肯定我们的一切共同愿望和要求。这就是我们在这里的主要任务。至于我们的不同点，没有人要求我们中间的任何人放弃他自己的观点，因为观点的不同是一个客观现实。但是，我们不应该让我们的分歧妨碍我们在我们的主要任务方面取得协议。我们应该在我们的共同点的基础上，设法了解和体谅我们所持的不同意见。
    现在，首先我愿意谈谈不同的思想体系和社会制度的问题。我们必须承认：在我们亚洲和非洲的国家中间，确实存在着不同的思想体系和不同的社会制度。但是，这并不能阻止我们寻求共同的基础，并团结起来。第二次世界大战以后，已经出现了许多独立国家。其中一类是由共产党领导的国家，另一类是由民族主义者领导的国家。第一类国家是不多的。不过，有些人不喜欢这样的事实：六亿中国人民已经选择了一种社会主义性质的、由中国共产党领导的政治制度，中国人民不再受帝国主义者统治了。第二类国家数目较多，例如印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和亚洲和非洲的其他许多国家。这两类国家都已经从殖民统治下获得独立，现在还在继续进行斗争，争取完全的独立。有什么理由说我们不能彼此了解和尊重、互相支持和同情呢？完全有理由使五项原则成为在我们之间建立友好、合作和善邻关系的基础。我们亚洲国家和非洲国家，包括中国在内，在经济上和文化上都是落后的。既然我们的亚非会议并不排斥任何人，为什么我们自己不能彼此了解，进行友好合作呢？
    其次，我愿意谈一谈是否有宗教信仰自由的问题。宗教信仰自由是一切现代国家所承认的一个原则。我们共产党人是无神论者，但是我们尊重一切有宗教信仰的人。我们希望那些有宗教信仰的人也能尊重那些没有宗教信仰的人。中国是一个有宗教信仰自由的国家。中国不仅有七百万共产党人，而且还有几千万回教徒、佛教徒和几百万基督教徒和天主教徒。在这里的中国代表团中就有一位信奉伊斯兰教的虔诚的阿訇。这种情况并不妨碍中国的内部团结。在亚洲和非洲国家的大家庭中，为什么不能使有宗教信仰的人同没有宗教信仰的人团结一致呢？煽动宗教纠纷的日子应该已经过去了，因为靠煽动这种纠纷而取得利益的人并不是在我们中间的人。
    第三，我想谈一谈所谓颠覆活动的问题。中国人民反对殖民主义的斗争进行了一百多年。中国共产党所领导的民族民主革命斗争只是在经过三十年的艰难困苦的过程之后，才最后取得胜利的。要说出中国人民在帝国主义、封建主义和蒋介石的统治下所受的一切苦难是不可能的。最后，中国人民选择了他们的国家制度和现政府。中国革命取得胜利是由于中国人民的努力。肯定地，它不是从外部输入的。就连那些不喜欢中国革命的胜利的人也不能否认这一点。中国有一句谚语说：“己所不欲，勿施于人”。我们是反对外来干涉的；我们怎么可能要干涉他人的内政呢？有人说，有着一千万以上的海外华侨，他们的双重国籍可能被利用来进行颠覆活动。但是双重国籍问题是旧中国遗留下来的东西。直到现在，蒋介石仍在利用为数极少的华侨来对他们居住的国家进行颠覆活动。但是，新中国的人民政府愿意同有关国家的政府解决华侨的双重国籍问题，又有人说，中国的傣族自治区是对别人的一个威胁。中国境内的少数民族有几十个民族，人口在四千万人以上。傣族和同傣族同源的僮族有将近一千万人。既然它们确实存在着，我们就必须给予它们自治的权利。正像缅甸有一个掸族自治邦一样，中国的每一个少数民族都有它的自治区。中国的少数民族在中国国内行使他们的自治权利，这怎么能说是对我们邻邦的一种威胁呢？
    我们现在准备在严格遵守五项原则的基础上同所有亚非国家、同世界上所有国家，首先是同我们的邻邦，建立正常的关系。现在的问题不是我们正在对其他国家的政府进行颠覆活动，而是有人正在中国周围建立基地，以便对中国政府进行颠覆活动。例如，在中国和缅甸的边境上，事实上存在着蒋介石集团的残余武装分子，他们正在对中国和缅甸两国进行破坏活动，由于中国和缅甸之间的友好关系，由于我们一向尊重缅甸的主权，我们相信缅甸政府能够解决这个问题。
    中国人民已经选择了并且拥护他们自己的政府。中国有着宗教信仰的自由。中国毫无颠覆它的邻邦的政府的意图。相反地，中国却遭受美利坚合众国赤裸裸的、公开进行的颠覆活动之害。谁要是不相信这一点，可以到中国去或者派人到那里去亲自看看。我们知道，那些还不知道真相的人心中是有怀疑的。中国俗话说：“百闻不如一见”。我们欢迎所有参加这个会议的国家的代表随便什么时候去访问中国。我们没有竹幕，但是有人在我们之间散布烟幕。
    亚洲和非洲的十六亿人民希望我们这个会议成功。全世界所有希望和平的国家和人民，都在期待会议对于扩大和平地区和建立集体和平作出贡献。让我们亚洲和非洲国家团结起来，尽最大努力，使亚非会议成功。　（新华社万隆十九日电）
