    International Public Opinion Welcomes the Convening of the Asian-African Conference
    Soviet "Izvestia"
    On the 19th, "Izvestia" published an editorial entitled "Striving for the Freedom and Independence of the Asian and African Peoples," welcoming the opening of the Asian-African Conference in Bandung.
    The editorial wrote that the convening of the Asian-African Conference is a major event. Representatives of Asian and African countries are gathering together for the first time in history to discuss their common problems. The Bandung Conference is a hallmark of our time. In discussing the tasks of the Bandung Conference and the issues of particular concern to the peoples of Asia and Africa, the editorial said that in the current situation, the struggle to defend and consolidate peace is of particular significance for Asian and African countries. Imperialist countries are doing everything possible to prepare for a war against peace-loving countries, and they regard some Asian and African countries as military bridgeheads and as sources of strategic raw materials and manpower. In the Far East, Southeast Asia, and the Near and Middle East, aggressive blocs are increasingly frantically piecing together military groups and alliances.
    The peoples of Asia and Africa are increasingly aware that without guaranteeing peace and mutual cooperation, they cannot defend and consolidate their national independence, nor can they guarantee the conditions for their own political, economic, and cultural development.
    The editorial went on to say that the Asian-African Conference has received the broadest support in all countries of the world because of its noble mission. Only those who oppose peace in the reactionary imperialist camp have adopted an undisguised hostile attitude towards the convening of this conference. However, none of their conspiracies have been able to prevent the timely convening of this conference with its extremely full and significant representation.
    The editorial concluded by saying that the Soviet people fully understand the struggle of the Asian and African countries against all forms of colonial rule and for their own political and economic independence. The people of the republics located in the Asian part of the Soviet Union express particular sympathy and great respect for the struggle of their brothers—the Asian people—for national independence, for peace, and for economic and cultural development.
    The Soviet people wish the conference fruitful results and victory in solving the noble tasks it faces.
    Vietnamese "People's Daily"
    The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 18th, welcoming the convening of the Asian-African Conference. The editorial wrote that the Asian-African Conference, attended by representatives of twenty-nine countries, is the result of the heroic and victorious struggle waged by the Asian and African peoples against colonialism for centuries. Therefore, the imperialists, headed by the American imperialists, are trembling before the Asian-African Conference, and they are stepping up their conspiracies in an attempt to save their defeat and maintain their colonial rule in Asia and Africa.
    The editorial said: The purpose of the Asian-African Conference is entirely consistent with the strong aspirations of the Asian and African peoples. As long as all participating countries concentrate their efforts to seek good achievements, the Asian-African Conference will make a huge contribution to the struggle of the Asian and African peoples for national liberation and world peace.
    The editorial concluded by saying that the Vietnamese people fully agree with the purpose of the Asian-African Conference. The delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam participating in the Asian-African Conference will certainly do its utmost to make due contributions to the success of this conference.
    Indian newspapers
    Indian newspapers widely published commentaries welcoming the convening of the Asian-African Conference.
    The Hindi newspaper "Nava Bharat" published an editorial on the 15th, saying that the era in which the fate of Asian and African countries was decided by other countries according to their interests and with the intention of expanding their empires has come to an end. The editorial said that the peoples of Asia and Africa today are determined neither to enslave others nor to be enslaved by others again. It is hoped that the Asian-African Conference will not only become a solid foundation for establishing friendly relations between Asian and African countries, but also a precursor to world peace.
    The "Glory Daily" published an editorial on the 18th, saying that the Asian-African Conference faces the task of uniting Asian and African countries on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence rather than on the basis of military alliance policies. The editorial criticized military treaties like the Manila Treaty for disrupting world peace.
    The "Epoch-Making Times" published an editorial on the 17th, saying that the Asian-African Conference is a meeting of newly awakened Asian and African countries, which are full of confidence in their newly acquired prestige and unity. The editorial pointed out that Western countries are secretly attempting to undermine the Asian-African Conference. However, despite their attempts, the noble cause of the Asian-African Conference cannot be undermined.
    Benares' "Today News" published an editorial on the 16th, condemning certain countries for trying to create obstacles and attempting to undermine the Asian-African Conference, and even conspiring to assassinate the representatives attending the Asian-African Conference to obstruct the work of the conference. The editorial said that despite these obstacles, the Asian-African Conference will definitely succeed.
    Indonesian newspapers
    Indonesian newspapers published editorials one after another on the 18th, welcoming the convening of the Asian-African Conference.
    "People's Daily" wrote in its editorial that it is the first time in history that twenty-nine Asian and African countries, representing more than half of the world's population, have gathered together to plan their own destiny on their own land. The optimism of the delegates shows that the conference will be fruitful.
    "Independent Daily" said that the Bandung Conference is paving the way for getting rid of the oppression of colonialism. This conference provides an excellent opportunity to consolidate mutual relations. The newspaper pointed out that only through consolidated cooperation can the remnants of colonialism be eliminated and the development of countries in political, economic, social and cultural aspects be guaranteed.
    "Construction Daily" said that although the countries participating in the conference have different views and interests, they will unanimously oppose colonialism and imperialism, because almost all of these countries have suffered from it.
    "Eternity Daily" said that the unity of Asia and Africa has a solid foundation, because almost all Asian and African countries have experienced foreign rule.
    "Indonesian Observer" said in an editorial that the whole world is now paying close attention to the items discussed at the Asian-African Conference. Because the results of the conference may bring mankind closer to peace, and may end the suffering of human war. The newspaper concluded by writing that it is time for Asian and African countries to show their unity to the world. Asian and African countries should step forward to accomplish the task of maintaining peace.
    "Indonesian News" said that the name of the conference has almost become synonymous with peaceful coexistence. The newspaper emphasized the necessity of coexistence. It also hoped that the conference may lead to a new era of relations between Asian and African countries, and lead to an era of peaceful coexistence. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

专栏：

    各国舆论欢迎召开亚非会议
    苏联“消息报”
    十九日“消息报”以“争取亚非各国人民的自由和独立”为题发表社论，欢迎在万隆开幕的亚非会议。
    社论写道，亚非会议的召开是一件大事。亚非国家代表在历史上第一次聚集一堂，讨论他们共同的问题。万隆会议，这是我们时代的一个标志。社论在谈到万隆会议的任务和会议将要研究的对亚洲和非洲人民特别有关的问题时说，在当前情况下，保卫和巩固和平的斗争，对于亚非国家说来具有特别的意义。帝国主义国家正在千方百计地准备对爱好和平的国家发动战争，它们把亚洲和非洲的一些国家看作军事桥头堡，看作战略原料和人力的供应地。在远东、东南亚和近中东，侵略集团正在日益疯狂地拼凑军事集团和同盟。
    亚非各国人民日益清楚地认识到，不保障和平和相互合作，就不能够捍卫和巩固本国的独立，就不可能保障本国政治、经济和文化发展的条件。
    社论接着说，亚非会议以它的崇高任务在世界一切国家中得到了最广泛的支持。只有帝国主义反动阵营中的反对和平的人才对这次会议的召开采取无法掩饰的敌视态度。但是，他们的任何阴谋诡计都没有能够阻止这次具有极其充分的和重大的代表性的会议的如期召开。
    社论最后说，苏联人民对亚非国家为反对任何形式的殖民统治和争取自己的政治及经济独立而进行的斗争是完全理解的。位于苏联亚洲部分的各共和国的人民对他们的弟兄——亚洲人民争取民族独立、争取和平、争取经济和文化的发展而进行的斗争表示特别同情和极大的尊敬。
    苏联人民祝会议在解决它所面临的崇高任务中获得有成效的成果，获得胜利。
      越南“人民报”
    越南“人民报”十八日发表社论，欢迎亚非会议的召开。社论写道，有二十九个国家的代表参加的亚非会议是亚非人民对殖民主义进行了几世纪的英勇的和胜利的斗争的结果。因此，以美帝国主义者为首的帝国主义者在亚非会议面前发起抖来，他们正在加紧进行阴谋活动，企图挽救他们的失败，并保持他们在亚洲和非洲的殖民统治。
    社论说：亚非会议的目的是和亚非人民的强烈的愿望完全一致的。只要所有参加会议的国家集中它们的努力谋求良好的成就，那么，亚非会议对亚非人民为民族解放而进行的斗争和世界和平将会有巨大的贡献。
    社论最后说，越南人民完全同意亚非会议的目的。参加亚非会议的越南民主共和国政府代表团一定竭尽全力，作出应有的贡献，以便使这次会议得到成功。
      印度报纸
    印度报纸广泛发表评论，欢迎亚非会议的召开。
    印地文报纸“新国家报”十五日发表社论说，由其他国家按照它们的利益和扩大它们的帝国的意图来决定亚洲和非洲国家命运的时代已经宣告结束了。社论说，亚洲和非洲人民今天决心既不打算奴役别人，也不愿意再受别人奴役。希望亚非会议将不仅成为亚非国家之间建立友好联系的坚固基础，而且也成为世界和平的前驱。
    “光荣报”十八日发表社论说，亚非会议面临着使亚非国家根据和平共处原则而不是根据军事联盟政策团结起来的任务。社论指责马尼拉条约这类军事条约扰乱世界和平。
      “划时代报”十七日发表社论说，亚非会议是新觉醒的亚洲和非洲国家的会议，它们对它们新近取得的威信和团结满怀着信心。社论指出，西方国家暗中企图破坏亚非会议。但是，尽管他们有这样的企图，亚非会议的崇高事业是破坏不了的。
    贝拿勒斯的“今天报”十六日发表社论斥责某些国家竭力制造障碍，图谋破坏亚非会议，甚至阴谋谋杀出席亚非会议的代表来阻挠会议的工作。社论说，尽管有这些障碍，亚非会议是一定会成功的。
      印度尼西亚报纸
    印度尼西亚各报十八日纷纷发表社论，欢迎亚非会议的召开。
    “人民日报”在社论中写道，代表着世界人口半数以上的二十九个亚非国家聚集一堂，在他们自己的土地上规划他们自己的命运，这在历史上还是第一次。代表们的乐观精神表明会议将是有成果的。
      “独立报”说，万隆会议正在为摆脱殖民主义的压迫铺平道路。这次会议为巩固相互之间的关系提供了绝好的机会。这家报纸指出，只有通过巩固的合作才能消灭殖民主义残余，才能保证各国的政治、经济、社会和文化方面的发展。
    “建设日报”说，虽然参加会议的各国有着不同的观点和利益，但是它们将会一致反对殖民主义和帝国主义，因为差不多所有这些国家都曾身受其害。
    “永恒报”说，亚洲和非洲的团结有着坚实的基础，因为几乎所有的亚非国家都经受过外国的统治。
      “印度尼西亚观察家报”在社论中说，全世界现在正非常关心地注视着亚非会议上讨论的项目。因为会议的结果可能使人类更接近于和平，可能会结束人类的战争的痛苦。该报最后写道，已经是亚非国家向全世界显示它们的团结的时候了。亚非国家应该挺身出来完成维护和平这个任务。
      “印度尼西亚新闻”说，会议的名字几乎成了和平共处的同义词。报纸着重指出了共处的必要性。它还希望会议可能会导向亚非国家之间的关系的新纪元，导向和平共处的纪元。（据新华社讯）
