Chongqing Sailors Transport Oxen to Support Disaster Areas in Hubei

The Chongqing Branch of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration Bureau has dispatched six landing craft to transport oxen to support spring plowing and production in the disaster areas of Hubei. From March 21st to April 8th, 5,724 oxen were transported from Wanxian to Yichang along the route. This batch of oxen will be transferred from Jianli County, Hubei, to the disaster areas. During the transportation, in order to prevent the oxen from fighting each other and causing injuries or deaths, the sailors adopted the method of loading them "head to tail" and "separating males and females," which ensured the safety and comfort of the oxen and the smooth navigation of the ships. The sailors in the Wanxian section have all overfulfilled their task of transporting oxen. (Our correspondent in Chongqing)

    重庆海员运耕牛支援湖北灾区
    长江航务管理局重庆分局抽调六艘登陆艇运输耕牛，支援湖北灾区春耕生产。从万县到宜昌的航线上，三月二十一日至四月八日，先后运出耕牛五千七百二十四头。这批耕牛将从湖北监利县转运至灾区。运牛中，海员们为避免耕牛互相斗殴和伤亡，采取“头对尾”“公母分开”装运的办法，使耕牛安全舒适，船身航行平稳。万县段海员们已全部超额完成运牛任务。（本报驻重庆记者）
