    Farmers in Songban Township Use Walnut Residue to Feed Pigs
    Farmers in Songban Township, Qianyang County, Hunan Province, are experimenting with using walnut residue (the leftover pulp after pressing walnuts for oil) to feed pigs, which saves grain and makes the pigs grow faster and fatter. Last year, farmer Zhou Kaitang of the township used more than 400 jin of walnut residue to raise a pig to a net weight of 120 jin in 240 days. Jiang Fuyuan had a 12-jin piglet, and after feeding it more than 400 jin of walnut residue for 154 days, it grew into a 144-jin fat pig. As a result, farmers in the township are now using walnut residue to feed pigs and no longer burn it as firewood. Farmers in nearby Shishou and Rongxi Townships, influenced by them, are also actively adopting walnut residue to feed pigs. (Chen Qiuming)

    松板乡农民利用核桃枯喂猪
    湖南省黔阳县七区松板乡农民试用核桃枯（即核桃榨油剩下的渣子）喂猪，既节省了粮食，猪也长得又快又肥。去年，该乡农民周开堂用四百多斤核桃枯，在二百四十天内，便喂成了一头净重一百二十斤的肥猪。蒋福元有一头十二斤重的仔猪，用四百多斤核桃枯喂了一百五十四天，便长成了一百四十四斤重的肥猪。因此，现在该乡农民都把核桃枯拿来喂猪，再不把它当作柴烧了。附近的石首、溶溪等乡农民在他们影响下，也都积极采用核桃枯喂猪。　（陈球明）
