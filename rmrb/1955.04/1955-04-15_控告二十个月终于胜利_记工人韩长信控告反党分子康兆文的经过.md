Victory After Twenty Months of Accusation
—Recording the Process of Worker Han Changxin's Accusation Against the Anti-Party Element Kang Zhaowen
By Our Correspondent Chang Gong

The serious anti-Party incident in which Kang Zhaowen, the secretary of the general Party branch of the small rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, stole worker Han Changxin's rationalization proposal for creating the southern steel-turning machine, and viciously attacked and framed this worker, went through a rather long period from occurrence to final settlement. In order to clear himself of injustice and uphold the justice of the Party and the people, worker Han Changxin ran to eight departments in Anshan City, seeking directors, section chiefs, ministers, and secretaries more than a hundred times. The procrastination and irresponsible bureaucratic style of the relevant authorities and some responsible cadres in Anshan City in handling this incident were serious.

As early as March 1953, about three months after the incident occurred, Han Changxin went to the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Supervision Office to complain. The director of this office and the cadres below had listened to his complaints one after another, and contacted relevant departments for his request to continue the trial production of the northern steel-turning machine and to transfer his job. However, they did not send anyone to investigate, but only felt that the problem was too complicated and involved leading Party cadres. Under Han Changxin's repeated urging, the Supervision Office transferred his accusation to the Anshan Municipal Party Committee Discipline Inspection Commission on June 22. Not long before this, the anti-Party element Kang Zhaowen fabricated the "fabricated" charge that Han Changxin put oil in the oxygen meter and wanted to cause the air duct to explode, conspiring to further frame Han Changxin, and threatened to send Han Changxin to court and imprison him. Seeing Kang Zhaowen framing him so viciously, Han Changxin couldn't figure it out for a while, so he ran to the Anshan Municipal People's Court to surrender himself. Because Han Changxin had not committed any crime at all, and no one had sued him in court, the court was right not to take him in. However, the people's judicial organs, whose responsibility is to protect the people's democratic rights and punish all criminal acts, should have informed the relevant authorities in Anshan City of this matter afterwards, which would have been a responsible expression to the people. However, the cadre of the Anshan Municipal People's Court who received Han Changxin just sent Han Changxin away and did not report to the leading comrades of the court. At this time, Han Changxin planned to go to Beijing to file a complaint. His wife was afraid that no one would take care of her after he left, so she threatened to commit suicide, and he had to cry bitterly and give up.

Logically speaking, when Han Changxin's accusation was transferred from the Supervision Office to the Anshan Municipal Party Committee Discipline Inspection Commission, it should have been highly valued by this organ whose duty is to accept appeals and accusations from Party members and the masses. But the fact is not like this. What Han Changxin encountered here were even more egregious bureaucrats: they did not warmly welcome appeals and accusations from the masses, but treated them coldly; they did not highly sympathize with the tragic experiences of the masses, but were indifferent to them. Liu Baoxiang, the director of the office of this organ, did not ask for instructions or report to Shen Dongli, the deputy director of the Organization Department of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee and deputy secretary of the Discipline Inspection Commission, but handed over the accusation case to inspector Du Weichen to investigate. And Du Weichen committed serious errors of biased listening and subjectiveism in investigating this case. After he arrived at the small rolling mill, he heard from the anti-Party element Kang Zhaowen and his loyal followers Zhang Zeguo, Union Chairman Liu Tingfeng, and Union Vice Chairman Yao Qingbai that Han Changxin's character was not good and that there were historical problems; that the southern steel-turning machine was not created by him, but by Kang Zhaowen and Zhou Renyuan; that the reason why Han Changxin complained everywhere was to show off, and that it was not Kang Zhaowen who attacked Han Changxin, but only that Kang Zhaowen's way of working with Han Changxin was not good. Du Weichen believed these words easily and also had a bad impression of Han Changxin. Therefore, after Du Weichen went back, he wrote a report based on the opinions of Kang Zhaowen, Zhang Zeguo, and others. After this report was written, he gave it to Liu Baoxiang, the director of the office. Liu Baoxiang did not give it to Shen Dongli, the leader of the Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission, to read, but sent it as the opinion of the Discipline Inspection Commission to the general Party branch committee of the small rolling mill under the leadership of the anti-Party element Kang Zhaowen, proposing that the leadership of this factory should use the method of "adopting multi-faceted education" to urge Han Changxin to "correct his mistakes." This means that a person suffers an injustice and has to complain to the superiors. But the result he gets is that he has to be educated by the person he is accusing to "correct mistakes." This way of handling problems is completely contrary to the principles of the Party.

Shen Dongli, who was actually in charge of the work of this organ in the Anshan Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission, did not know about these things for a long time (the Minister of the Municipal Party Committee Organization Department and Secretary of the Discipline Inspection Commission was recuperating). Moreover, in July, after Kang Zhaowen stole the workers' rationalization proposals, Kang Zhaowen was promoted from deputy secretary of the general Party branch to secretary of the general branch under the auspices of Shen Dongli. A year after this serious anti-Party incident occurred, Shen Dongli also said at a meeting of the general Party branch committee of the small rolling mill that Kang Zhaowen was a "good comrade." The occurrence of all these abnormal phenomena is, on the one hand, of course, the responsibility of the cadres below, especially the relevant cadres of the Discipline Inspection Commission, because they did not ask for instructions from Comrade Shen Dongli, or did not report the situation to him truthfully. However, as the deputy director of the Municipal Party Committee Organization Department and the deputy secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Discipline Inspection Commission, if he does not know that the deputy secretary of the general Party branch of a nationally renowned factory has become a thief, that the workers and the masses are talking about it, and that the victim has filed an accusation, but instead regards this anti-Party element as a "good comrade" to praise and promote, it shows how little Comrade Shen Dongli knows about the work of the Discipline Inspection Commission directly under his leadership, and how little he knows about the main cadres directly under his leadership. Can this dereliction of duty be forgiven?

The consequences of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee Discipline Inspection Commission's investigation report being sent to the general Party branch committee of the small rolling mill are predictable. The anti-Party element Kang Zhaowen became even bolder, and he openly threatened Han Changxin, saying: "You are still complaining about me to the Municipal Party Committee! Even if you complain about me to Beijing, you can't do anything to me!" Han Changxin felt that he could no longer stand in the small rolling mill, and ran to the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Supervision Office again and again to request a job transfer; after more than eight months of dragging on, there was still no result. Reminded by others, from March 1954, he went to the Anshan Municipal Party Committee People's Reception Office to complain. The cadres of the reception office reported Han Changxin's accusation to Han Tianshi, the secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, and Comrade Han Tianshi instructed the Municipal Party Committee Industry and Mining Department to study and handle it.

The Industry and Mining Department is the organ that directly leads the small rolling mill on behalf of the Municipal Party Committee. Logically speaking, this organ should take the initiative to discover problems. But the fact is not like that: the leaders of this department are usually high above, rarely go to the small rolling mill to understand the situation, and do not have a warm and welcoming attitude towards the accusations of the masses. Fan Shulin, the deputy director of this department, handed over the instruction of Comrade Han Tianshi to Wang Zhen, the director of the Rolling Steel Section of the Industry and Mining Department, who often went to the small rolling mill to help with the work, without any research, and never asked about the matter again since then. Zhao Jiaju, another deputy director of the Industry and Mining Department, although he kept a close eye on Wang Zhen after taking over the accusation case, he did not do it himself, and when Han Changxin repeatedly asked him about the handling of the case, he showed a very impatient emotion towards Han Changxin.

The leading cadres of this department treated the accusations of the masses with such an attitude, and Wang Zhen, whom they sent to investigate, was even more irresponsible. As early as May 1953, about four months after the theft occurred, Yan Ming, the former director and secretary of the general Party branch of the small rolling mill, had told Wang Zhen that Kang Zhaowen was suspected of stealing workers' rationalization proposals, but such an important situation was not taken seriously by Wang Zhen, and he subjectively and arbitrarily believed that Yan Ming was having "relations" with Kang Zhaowen. Wang Zhen neither helped the small rolling mill to clarify the facts, nor reported to the leaders of the Industry and Mining Department and the Anshan Municipal Party Committee.

More than a month later, Wang Zhen's investigation report was written. Although this report did not clarify the basic facts, it found that the creators of the southern steel-turning machine included Kang Zhaowen and Han Changxin, and especially found that Kang Zhaowen had stolen the rationalization proposal of "belt drop hammer" created by another worker. If Wang Zhen and the leaders of the Industry and Mining Department had seized these clues and pursued them at that time, the truth of the matter might have been revealed long ago. However, after this investigation report was written, the minister of the Industry and Mining Department did not read it, and sent it to the Municipal Party Committee Office as "reference" material in the name of the department. This is the attitude of the Municipal Party Committee Industry and Mining Department towards the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee Secretary, how irresponsible it is!

At this time, Liu Tingfeng, the chairman of the trade union of the small rolling mill, was about to be transferred to study. He was afraid that it would be unfavorable to him in the future when the truth of the Han Changxin incident was clarified, so he reflected to Wang Zhen that the main creator of the southern steel-turning machine was Han Changxin, not Kang Zhaowen. Wang Zhen didn't believe it at first. Liu Tingfeng said:
"Director Wang, think about it, Kang Zhaowen was a cook, and he only worked as a steel rolling worker for seven months. How could he create a steel-turning machine?" However, what is completely intolerable is that in the face of facts that cannot be disbelieved, Wang Zhen instead blamed Liu Tingfeng and said: "There is a problem with you as a comrade." But he himself said that the investigation report had been sent away and the task had been completed, and he did not even ask to take the report back for revision or send a correction material. At the same time, during this period, Han Changxin saw that this organ was investigating and that organ was also investigating, but the problem was not solved, so he had repeatedly looked for Wang Zhen. Wang Zhen's attitude towards him was very bad, and he even said such things: "You are like sticky rice cake!" The responsible cadres sent by the Anshan Municipal Party Committee Industry and Mining Department to often help an important factory are so irresponsible and so unprincipled!

As a leader of a local organization of our Party, he should have a high degree of principle, should maintain close contact with the people, especially the workers, listen to their voices and opinions with an open mind, and give practical support to the criticisms from below. Measured by these principles of the Party, Comrade Han Tianshi, the secretary of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee, had many shortcomings in handling the accusation case of worker Han Changxin. By the time Han Changxin filed an accusation with the Municipal Party Committee People's Reception Office, it had been one year and two months since the occurrence of this anti-Party incident, and he had run to several organs in Anshan City without solving the problem. Logically speaking, such a protracted and serious anti-Party incident should have been handled by Comrade Han Tianshi personally, and even if it was delegated to comrades below for handling, he should have kept a close watch on it and personally checked it. However, since Comrade Han Tianshi delegated this case to the Municipal Party Committee Industry and Mining Department for study and handling, he has never asked about it again. After the Municipal Party Committee Industry and Mining Department also failed to solve the problem, Han Changxin had looked for Comrade Han Tianshi many times, but he had never seen him, and when Han Changxin looked for Comrade Han Tianshi, Han Tianshi's secretary, Yang Runzhou, had also treated Han Changxin with a rude attitude. Some responsible persons of the Municipal Party Committee Office, the direct working organ of the Municipal Party Committee, were also very irresponsible. They not only failed to report the handling situation to Comrade Han Tianshi in a timely manner, but even failed to refer to a "reference" investigation report in a timely manner, and even wanted to use the simple method of asking Kang Zhaowen to admit his mistakes to Han Changxin before the basic facts had been clarified, so that this incident would be over.

Until July 1954, due to Han Changxin's constant accusations, the inspection team of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission also intervened in this matter, and the responsible comrades of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee Office began to feel that they could no longer delay it, and then re-examined the investigation report written by Wang Zhen and sent by the Municipal Party Committee Industry and Mining Department. Feeling that some places were unclear, they ordered the general Party branch committee of the small rolling mill to clarify the facts before September 1 and report to the Municipal Party Committee, and designated Comrade Wang Zhen to participate in this work. At this time, Yan Ming, Wang Naixin, Bai Chunzhu, Liu Tingfeng, Zhang Zeguo and other former general branch members of the small rolling mill had left, and Wang Zhen brought them back. Among the members of the general Party branch committee of the small rolling mill, except for Zhang Zeguo who was not enlightened, other members studied the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session and saw that the Municipal Party Committee had paid attention to the matter, so they broke through all concerns and exposed Kang Zhaowen's anti-Party crimes, and wrote a report to the Municipal Party Committee on September 20. After receiving the report, the Municipal Party Committee Office felt that the problem was serious, so it asked the Industry and Mining Department and the Discipline Inspection Commission to verify it. From late September to February this year, these two departments successively conducted two large-scale investigation and verification works, confirming that Han Changxin's accusation was in line with the facts. Subsequently, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held several meetings to discuss this incident, decided to expel Kang Zhaowen from the Party, and other Party members who had made mistakes were also punished accordingly. The Municipal Party Committee itself also made a preliminary self-criticism.

This serious anti-Party incident with significant and egregious circumstances has finally been dealt with! However, the problems exposed by this incident are very serious. The Anshan Municipal Party Committee should not be satisfied with handling this incident, but should use it well to educate Party members and cadres, and earnestly learn lessons from it. Only in this way can we effectively improve the political and ideological awareness of Party members and cadres, continuously improve the work style of various organs and departments, and better complete the arduous economic construction tasks assigned to the Anshan Municipal Party Organization by the Party and the people.

    控告二十个月终于胜利
    ——记工人韩长信控告反党分子康兆文的经过
    本报记者　常工
    鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂党总支委员会书记康兆文窃夺工人韩长信创造南部翻钢机的合理化建议，并且对这个工人实行恶毒的打击和陷害的严重反党事件，从发生到最后处理结案，经过了一段相当长的时间。工人韩长信为了洗清自己身上的冤屈，申张党和人民的正义，曾经跑过鞍山市的八个机关部门，先后找主任、找处长、找部长、找书记等不下一百多次。在这个事件的处理上，鞍山市有关机关和一些负责干部的拖拉、不负责任的官僚主义作风是严重的。
    早在一九五三年三月，也就是这个事件发生后大约三个月，韩长信就跑到鞍山钢铁公司监察室去申诉。这个机关的主任和下面的干部都先后听过他的申诉，也为他要求继续试制北部翻钢机和要求调动工作的事，同有关部门作过联系。但是他们没有派人调查，只是感觉到问题太复杂，牵涉到党内领导干部。在韩长信的一再催促之下，监察室在六月二十二日把他的控告转到了鞍山市委纪律检查委员会。就在这以前不久，反党分子康兆文捏造了韩长信往氧气表里放油、想使风筒爆炸的“莫须有”的罪名，阴谋进一步陷害韩长信，威胁说要把韩长信送到法院押起来。韩长信看到康兆文这样毒辣地陷害他，一时想不开，就跑到鞍山市人民法院去自动投案。因为韩长信根本没有犯罪，也没有人到法院控告他，法院不收留他，是作得对的。但是以保护人民的民主权利和惩罚一切犯罪行为为职责的人民司法机关，应该在事后把这件事转告鞍山市的有关机关，才是对人民负责的应有的表现。可是鞍山市人民法院接见韩长信的干部，只是把韩长信打发走了就算了，也没有向法院的领导同志汇报。这时，韩长信打算上北京告状，他妻子怕他走后无人照看，闹着要自杀，他只好痛哭一场作罢。
    按理说，当韩长信的控告由监察室转到鞍山市委纪律检查委员会以后，应该受到这个以受理党员、群众的申诉和控告为职责的机关的高度重视。但是事实不是这样的。韩长信在这里碰到的是更加恶劣的官僚主义分子：他们对来自群众的申诉和控告不是热烈欢迎，而是冷冷淡淡；他们对群众的悲痛的遭遇不是高度同情，而是漠然置之。这个机关办公室的主任刘宝祥，没有向鞍山市委组织部副部长兼纪律检查委员会副书记申东黎请示报告，就把这个控告案交给了检查员杜维臣去调查。而杜维臣在调查这个案件上又犯了严重的偏听偏信和主观主义的错误。他到小型轧钢厂以后，就先后从反党分子康兆文及其忠实信徒张泽国、工会主席刘廷峰和工会副主席姚青栢等人嘴里，听说韩长信的品质不好，还有历史问题；南部翻钢机不是他创造的，而是康兆文和周任源创造的；韩长信所以到处告状是想出风头，不是康兆文打击韩长信，仅只是康兆文对韩长信的工作方式不好。杜维臣轻信了这一席话，也对韩长信的印象不好。因此杜维臣回去以后，就根据康兆文、张泽国等人的意见写了一个报告。这个报告写好以后，他就交给办公室主任刘宝祥。刘宝祥又没有送给市纪律检查委员会的领导人申东黎同志看过，就把它作为纪律检查委员会的意见送给了反党分子康兆文领导下的小型轧钢厂党总支委员会，提议这个厂的领导上“必须采取多方面教育”的方法，促使韩长信“改正其错误”。这也就是说：一个人蒙受了不白之冤，不得不向上面控告。但是他所得到的结果，反而要由他所控告的人来教育他“改正错误”。这样处理问题是完全违反了党的原则的。
    在鞍山市纪律检查委员会中发生的这些事情，实际上负责领导这个机关工作的申东黎很长时间都不知道（市委组织部长兼纪委会书记正在休养）。而且在康兆文窃夺工人的合理化建议后的七月，在申东黎的主持下还把康兆文由党总支副书记提拔成了总支书记。在这个严重的反党事件发生了一年以后，申东黎在小型轧钢厂党总支委员会的一次会上，又说过康兆文是个“好同志”。所有这些反常现象的发生，一方面当然下面的干部、特别是纪律检查委员会的有关干部要负责，因为他们没有向申东黎同志请示报告，或者没有向他据实反映情况。但是作为市委组织部副部长和市委纪律检查委员会副书记，如果对一个闻名全国的工厂的党总支副书记已经变成了盗贼，工人群众都在议论纷纷，受害人已经提出了控告都不知道，相反的，还把这个反党分子当成“好同志”来表扬和提拔，这就说明申东黎同志对自己直接领导的纪律检查委员会的工作如何不了解，对自己直接领导下的主要干部如何不了解。这种失职行为难道是可以原谅的吗？
    鞍山市委纪律检查委员会的调查报告，送到小型轧钢厂党总支委员会以后，它产生的后果是可想而知的。反党分子康兆文的胆子更大了，他公开威胁韩长信说：“你还向市委告我呢！你把我告到北京，也不能把我怎么样！”韩长信感到无法再在小型轧钢厂立足，又三番五次地跑到鞍山钢铁公司监察室要求调动工作；拖了八个多月，仍然没有结果。经别人的提醒，从一九五四年三月开始，他又到鞍山市委人民接待室去控告。接待室的干部把韩长信的控告向市委书记韩天石作了汇报，韩天石同志批示交市委工矿部研究处理。
    工矿部是代表市委直接领导小型轧钢厂的机关。按理说，这个机关应该作到主动发现问题。但是事实也不是那样：这个部的领导人平日是高高在上，很少去小型轧钢厂了解情况，并且对群众的控告也不是抱着热烈欢迎的态度。这个部的副部长范树林接到韩天石同志的批示后，未作任何研究，就批交给工矿部经常到小型轧钢厂帮助工作的轧钢处处长王珍去调查，从此以后，就再也没有过问这件事情。工矿部的另一个副部长赵家驹在接管这个控告案件以后，虽然对王珍抓的很紧，但是他自己也没有亲自动手，并且在韩长信一再找他催问处理情况的时候，他还对韩长信表现了很不耐烦的情绪。
    这个部的领导干部是用这样的态度来对待群众的控告，而他们派去调查的王珍更是一个极不负责的人。早在一九五三年五月，即窃夺事件发生以后大约四个月，小型轧钢厂的前任厂长兼党总支书记燕鸣，就曾向王珍谈过康兆文有窃夺工人合理化建议的嫌疑，然而这样重要的情况，并没有受到王珍的重视，他竟主观武断地认为是燕鸣在同康兆文闹“关系”。王珍既未帮助小型轧钢厂弄清事实真象，也没有报告工矿部的领导人和鞍山市委。
    经过一个多月以后，王珍的调查报告写出来了。这个报告虽然没有弄清基本的事实，但是它发现南部翻钢机的创造者有康兆文，也有韩长信，特别是发现了康兆文曾经窃夺过另一工人创造的“皮带落下锤”合理化建议。如果王珍和工矿部的领导人，当时就抓住这些线索追下去，事情的真相可能早已大白于世了。但是，这个调查报告写出以后，工矿部的部长没有看过，就以部的名义，当作“参考”材料送给了市委办公室。这就是市委工矿部对待市委书记指示的态度，这是多么不负责任啊！
    就在这个时候，小型轧钢厂工会主席刘廷峰要调走学习，他怕将来韩长信事件的真相弄清以后对自己不利，就向王珍反映说南部翻钢机的主要创造者是韩长信，没有康兆文。王珍先不信，刘廷峰说：
  “王处长，你想一想吧，康兆文厨师出身，只当了七个月轧钢工人，他怎么能创造出翻钢机呢？”但是，完全令人不能容忍的是，王珍在不能不信的事实面前，反而责备刘廷峰说：“你这个同志太成问题。”而自己却以调查报告已经送走，任务已经完成，连把报告要回来修改一下或者送去一个更正材料也没有作。同时，在这个期间，韩长信眼看见这个机关调查，那个机关也调查，都没有解决问题，曾多次找过王珍。王珍对他的态度很恶劣，竟至说出了这样的话：“你这个人就像黏糕一样！”鞍山市委工矿部派出经常帮助一个重要工厂的负责干部，就是这样毫不负责，这样毫无原则！
    作为我们党的一个地方组织的领导人，他应该有高度的原则性，应该经常同人民群众、特别是工人群众保持着紧密的联系，虚心地听取他们的呼声和意见，给予来自下面的批评以切实的支持。用党的这些原则来衡量，中共鞍山市委书记韩天石同志，在处理工人韩长信的控告案上是有很多缺点的。在韩长信向市委人民接待室提出控告的时候，距离这个反党事件的发生已经有一年零两个月了，他跑过鞍山市的好几个机关都没有解决问题。按理说，这样一个拖延不决、情节重大恶劣的反党事件，应该由韩天石同志亲自主持处理，即使是批交下面的同志处理，也应该抓紧督促和亲自检查。但是，自从韩天石同志把这个案件批交市委工矿部研究处理以后，他就再没有过问过这件事。在市委工矿部也不能解决问题以后，韩长信曾经找过韩天石同志好多次，但是一直没有见到，并且在韩长信找韩天石同志的时候，韩天石同志的秘书杨润周还曾经用粗暴的态度对待韩长信。市委的直接办事机构——市委办公室的一些负责人也很不负责任，他们不但没有及时向韩天石同志汇报处理情况，而且连一个供“参考”的调查报告也没有及时参考，甚至在基本事实尚未查清之前，就想用要康兆文向韩长信承认错误的简便办法，使这一事件不了了之。
    直到一九五四年的七月，由于韩长信的不断控告，中央纪律检查委员会检查组也过问了这件事，鞍山市委办公室负责同志也开始感到拖不下去了，才重新研究了市委工矿部送去的王珍写的调查报告，感到有些地方不清楚，就责成小型轧钢厂党总支委员会在九月一日以前把事实查清，报告市委，并且指定王珍同志参加这个工作。这个时候，小型轧钢厂的前总支委员燕鸣、王乃信、白纯珠、刘廷峰、张泽国等已经离开了，王珍把他们找了回去。小型轧钢厂党总支委员会委员中，除了张泽国没有觉悟外，其他委员学习了四中全会决议，又看见市委已注意这事，就打破一切顾虑，把康兆文反党的罪恶行为揭露出来了，并且在九月二十日给市委写了一个报告。市委办公室接到报告后，感到问题严重，就叫工矿部、纪律检查委员会进行核对。这两个部门从九月下旬到今年二月为止，先后进行了两次大规模的调查核对工作，证实了韩长信的控告是符合事实的。接着中共鞍山市委举行了数次会议，讨论了这一事件，决定开除康兆文出党，其他有错误的党员也分别受到处分。市委本身也作了初步检讨。
    这个情节重大恶劣的反党事件，终于处理了！但是这个事件暴露出来的问题是很严重的。鞍山市委不应以处理了这个事件为满足，应该很好地用它来教育党员、干部，切实地从中吸取教训。只有这样，才能有效地提高党员、干部的政治思想觉悟，不断地改进各机关各部门的工作作风，更好地完成党和人民交付给鞍山市党组织的繁重的经济建设任务。
