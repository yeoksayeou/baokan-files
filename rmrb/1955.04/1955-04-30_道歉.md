"Apology"
    Tian Liu
    Time – March 8, 1955
    Place – Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province
    Characters – Recipient of the telegram (referred to as A), Recipient's guest (referred to as B), Director of the Telegram Delivery Room of the Taiyuan Post and Telecommunications Bureau (referred to as Post), Xiao Ren (referred to as Xiao)

    The recipient is discussing a matter with a guest when the Director of the Telegram Delivery Room of the Post and Telecommunications Bureau arrives. A and B stand up to greet him, but they do not know who he is.
    Post: I am the Director of the Telegram Delivery Room of the Taiyuan Post and Telecommunications Bureau. I've come to talk to you (eyes fixed on A) about that telegram and to apologize to you.
    A: Ah, (understandingly) very good, very good. Your serious and responsible work style is very good.
    Post: (Explaining) That day, that is, March 4th, there were too many telegrams coming and going, and we did not have enough delivery staff, so it was delivered a little late.
    A: How many pieces were there in total?
    Post: (Hesitating for a moment) There were… there were over a thousand pieces in total.
    A: The recipient knows that a telegram has arrived for them, but they can't see it, so they are very anxious. That morning at six o'clock, your bureau called to say that you had my telegram and asked for the address. Why wasn't it delivered until 10:40 a.m.? Did it start snowing heavily after six o'clock, and the delivery staff…
    Post: No, no. Our work discipline is that we operate day and night, regardless of wind or rain.
    A: (Conciliatory) Okay, let's not worry about that for now. But why, when telegrams received by your bureau at one or two o'clock in the morning are delivered to the recipient at eleven o'clock, are they still in code and not translated?
    Post: (Very sympathetically) We, who work in the people's postal and telecommunications service, fully understand the anxious feelings of the recipient when they know that there is a telegram for them but cannot see it. This happened entirely because we are busy, busy. We have repeatedly asked our superiors to increase our staffing, but it has never been approved. Alas, alas, (Helplessly) our staffing can't keep up with the development of our business…
    A: Isn't delivering untranslated telegrams to the recipient the same as not delivering them at all, and doesn't it increase the recipient's "anxious feelings" even more? May I ask, does this situation only happen to me by chance, or is it frequent?
    Post: (Affirmatively) This is entirely because there were too many telegrams that day, entirely because… alas, the staffing can't keep up with the development of our business. As for you this time, this phenomenon has not occurred since June of 1953…
    A: You mean this kind of thing hasn't happened since June 1953?
    Post: It hasn't happened. It happened in the first half of 1953. After the masses gave us their opinions, we conducted frequent education and inspection, and we have thoroughly corrected this irresponsible work style.
    A: (Excitedly, but trying to remain calm) I'll provide you with a piece of information. Last September, I received a telegram that was not translated; in December, I received another telegram that was not translated, and the third telegram, you know, is this one, which also was not translated. Since I came to work in Taiyuan, I have only received three telegrams, and none of them were translated. The time was after September 1954, not before June 1953.
    Post: (Flustered, face a little red) This… this…
    B: Let me also provide you with some information: last June and August, I received two telegrams, and neither of them was translated. I don't understand the postal and telecommunications bureau's operating regulations, and I thought it was just a regulation that they wouldn't translate them. I took the telegram to the post and telecommunications bureau to inquire, and the comrades in the telegram delivery room were neither busy translating telegrams nor holding meetings or studying; they were just sitting in the office chatting idly.
    A comrade threw a codebook out the window and said, "Translate it yourself; this is a codebook." Then he turned around and went back to chatting. A telegram of fifty or sixty words took me almost an hour and a half to translate, and the comrades in the post and telecommunications bureau were still inside laughing at how slowly I was translating.
    A: (Laughing) How coincidental that another telegram recipient has come forward. (Turning serious) Director, now it seems that the problem is very clear. This is not an isolated, accidental phenomenon, but something that happens frequently. You say that this phenomenon only existed before 1953, but that is not the case at all. There are only two possible explanations for this: either you have a serious bureaucratic work style, and you simply don't know what's going on at the grassroots level, and you don't know how the staff in the telegram delivery room under your leadership usually carry out their work; or you do know about these many phenomena, and today you have come to apologize to the recipient only for the sake of making a perfunctory apology, for the sake of deceiving the recipient, and after glossing over this matter, you will continue to work in the same way as you have in the past.
    Post: (Flustered) This… this…, no… no, I often… often educate them… it's not that I don't understand… ah, it's… it's that I don't quite understand the situation at the grassroots level… it's a bit bureaucratic. (Quieter) When I go back… I… I will further investigate and be sure to resolutely correct it…
    A: B: We both hope that similar things will not happen again in the future.
    (The Director of the Telegram Delivery Room of the Post and Telecommunications Bureau leaves hastily. Xiao Ren, who is tidying up the room on the side, walks up to A and B.)
    Xiao: He says that more than a thousand telegrams come and go every day; I don't believe it. In the last four or five months, we've delivered a total of ten or so telegrams, and I've delivered them all. Sometimes I went in the morning, and sometimes I went in the afternoon or evening, and I never once ran into anyone else delivering telegrams. During the day, they're playing; at night, they're sleeping…
    A: Is it possible that even the number of incoming and outgoing telegrams is false?

### “道歉”

    “道歉”
    田流
    时间——一九五五年三月八日
    地点——山西省太原市
    人物——受报人（简称甲）、受报人的客人（简称乙）、太原邮电局来报室主任（简称邮）、小任（简称小）
    受报人正同客人商量问题，邮电局来报室主任上。甲、乙起立招呼，但不知来者是谁。
    邮：我是太原邮电局来报室主任，来向你（眼睛望着甲）谈一谈那封电报的事情，并向你道歉。
    甲：啊，（省悟地）很好很好，你们这种认真负责的工作作风是很好的。
    邮：（解释地）那天，就是三月四号那天，来往电报太多，送报员不够用，所以才送晚了些。
    甲：共有多少件呢？
    邮：（迟疑了一阵）共……共一千多件。
    甲：受报人知道自己来了电报，又看不见它，心里是很着急的。那天早晨六点钟，你局来电话说有我的电报，问住址，怎么一直到十点四十分钟才送到？是不是六点钟以后下起大雪来，送报员……
    邮：不是不是，我们的工作纪律是昼夜不停风雨无阻的。
    甲：（和解地）好，先不管这些吧。但为什么早晨一、两点钟你局收到的电报，十一点钟送到受报人手里时还是电报号码，不给翻译出来呢？
    邮：（非常同情地）我们做人民邮电工作的，是十分懂得受电人知道有自己的电报、又看不见电报时的焦急心情的。发生这事情完全因为忙、忙。我们几次要求上级增加编制，可是一直不批准。哎哎，（无可奈何地）编制赶不上业务的发展……
    甲：你们把不翻出来的电报送给受报人，不是等于没送到，更增加了受报人的“焦急心情”么？请问，这种情形只是碰巧发生在我身上呢，还是经常如此？
    邮：（肯定地）这完全是因为那天电报太多，完全是……哎，编制赶不上业务发展。就是你这一次，从一九五三年六月份以后，从没有发生过这现象……。
    甲：一九五三年六月以后没发生过这种事情？
    邮：没发生过。一九五三年上半年曾发生过，群众给提出意见后，我们就经常进行教育、检查，已经彻底纠正了这种不负责任的工作作风。
    甲：（激动地，但尽量使自己平静）我供给你一个情况，去年九月我接到一封电报是没有翻的；十二月又接到一封电报也没有翻，第三封电报，你知道就是这一封，又没有翻。我来太原工作后，只接到过三次电报，都没翻，时间是一九五四年九月以后，不是一九五三年六月以前。
    邮：（慌乱地，脸有些红）这……这……
    乙：我也供给你们一点情况吧：去年六月和八月，我接到两次电报，也没翻。我不懂邮电局的业务规章，以为就是规定不给翻译出来呢。我拿着电报到邮电局询问，来报室的同志既没有忙着翻译电报稿，也没开会或学习，正坐在办公室说闲话呢。
  一个同志从窗口扔出一本电码本，说：“你自己翻吧，这是电码本。”扭身又去闲谈了。五、六十个字的电报，我闹了一点来钟才翻出来，邮电局的同志还在里面笑我翻得慢呢。
    甲：（笑起来）事情竟这么巧，又出来了一个受报人。（转而严肃地）主任同志，现在看起来问题很清楚了，这不是个别的偶然现象，而是经常如此。你说只在一九五三年以前才有这种现象，也完全不是那么回事。这原因只能有两个解释：要么你有严重的官僚主义作风，根本不知道下情，不知道你领导下的来报室工作人员平常怎样进行工作的；要么就是这许多现象你是知道的，今天你来向受报人道歉只是为了检讨而检讨，为了欺骗受报人。把这件事情敷衍过去后，照样像过去那样地工作。
    邮：（慌乱地）这……这……，不……不，我经常……经常教育他们……不是不了解……啊，是……是有点不了解下情……是有点官僚主义。（安静了些）回去我……我就进一步检查，一定坚决纠正……
  甲：乙：我们都希望今后不再发生类似的事情。
    （邮电局来报室主任匆促下，在一边收拾屋子的小任走到甲、乙面前。）
    小：他说一天来往一千多件电报我就不信，咱们最近四、五个月共送了十来封电报，都是我送的，有上午去的时候，也有下午和晚上去的时候，连一回也没碰见过别的发电报的人。白天去，他们在玩；晚上去，他们在睡觉……。
    甲：难道连来往电报的数目也是假的？
