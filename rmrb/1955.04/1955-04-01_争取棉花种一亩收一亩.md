Title: Strive to Harvest a Crop for Every Mu Planted with Cotton

For several years, many cotton-producing areas have frequently experienced a situation where the cotton field planting area exceeds the plan, but the actual harvest area is much lower than planned. As a result, millions of mu of cotton fields are abandoned each year across the country. This not only reduces the harvested area of cotton, but also results in very low yields when grain crops are replanted or intercropped in the abandoned cotton fields.

Why does this phenomenon occur? The main reason is that some cadres simply pursue the numerical targets for cotton planting area and use coercive methods to "mobilize" farmers to grow cotton. Some farmers plant first and then destroy, leading to serious false reporting. Some farmers, in order to cope with the urging of cadres, plant cotton on poor arable land, only planting but not harvesting, wasting manpower and materials.

Currently, some cotton-producing areas have begun to pay attention to this issue. Jiangsu Province has summarized its cotton planting experience from last year, identified the reasons for the large number of abandoned cotton fields, and formulated improvement measures: planting cotton on good and high-yielding fields, timely sowing, and improving cotton planting techniques. However, the leading bodies and cadres in some cotton-producing areas have not yet paid attention to this issue and have not shared the plan to expand cotton fields with the masses. In the Jinan Special District of Shanxi Province, the task of planting 100,000 mu of cotton fields had not been assigned as of early March. This can easily lead to the phenomenon of abandoned cotton fields, because if the planting task is assigned late, district and township cadres will not have enough time to persuade and educate cotton farmers, which will leave the cotton farmers unprepared in terms of spirit and material, and they will plant cotton on land unsuitable for cotton planting.

In order to expand the cotton planting area, some areas have reclaimed small plots of wasteland, preparing to use them to grow cotton. Although reclaiming small plots of wasteland can increase some arable land, whether these wastelands are suitable for cotton planting needs to be determined based on the actual situation. If it is not suitable for cotton planting but cotton is forced to be planted, it will inevitably be abandoned in the end. In other areas, preparations are being made to plant some wheat stubble cotton or wheat ridge cotton to offset the task of expanding cotton fields, which is naturally a way to expand the cotton planting area. However, wheat stubble cotton or wheat ridge cotton is a cultivation method suitable for double-cropping areas in the south. In northern areas with shorter growing seasons, changing single-crop cotton fields to double-cropping wheat and cotton will inevitably affect the unit yield of cotton. According to a typical survey in Jingyang County, Shaanxi Province, the yield of cotton grown after wheat stubble is about 43 percent lower per mu than that of single-crop cotton fields. If too much of this type of cotton field is planted, it will inevitably affect the cotton harvest.

The cotton sowing season is fast approaching. All localities should quickly make preparations for cotton planting, improve the quality of cotton field sowing, strive to harvest a crop for every mu planted, and do their best to reduce the area of abandoned cotton fields.

    争取棉花种一亩收一亩
  　赵乃文
    几年以来，很多产棉区经常发生这样一种情况：棉田播种面积超过了计划，但实际收获面积却比计划低很多。这样，全国每年有几百万亩棉田废弃了。这不仅减少了棉花的收获面积，就是在废弃的棉田中改种或间种粮食作物，单位产量也很低。
    为什么发生这种现象呢？主要原因是有些干部单纯追求棉花播种面积的数字，用强迫命令的方法，“动员”农民种植棉花；有的农民先种后毁，形成严重的虚假现象。有些农民为了应付干部的催促，把棉花种在不好的耕地上，只种不收，浪费了人力和物力。
    目前有些棉产区已经开始重视了这个问题，江苏省就总结了去年的植棉经验，找出了废弃棉田多的原因，订出了改进的办法：把好田、高田种植棉花，及时播种，提高种棉技术等。但是，有些棉产区的领导机关和干部还没有注意这个问题，没有把扩大棉田的计划和群众见面。山西省晋南专区有十万亩棉田的植棉任务直到三月初还没有布置。这就很容易造成废弃棉田的现象。因为植棉任务布置的晚，就不能使区乡干部有较多的时间对棉农进行说服教育工作，就会使棉农在精神上和物质上缺乏准备，而把棉花种在不适宜植棉的土地上。
    为了扩大植棉面积，有些地区就开垦小片荒地，准备用来种棉花。开垦小片荒地虽能增加一些耕地，但这些荒地是否适宜植棉，需要根据实际情况决定。如果不适宜植棉而勉强植棉，最后势必荒废。另有一些地区，准备种一部分麦茬花或麦垅花，抵充扩大棉田任务，这自然也是扩大植棉面积的一种办法。但麦茬花或麦垅花是一种适宜于南方的一年两熟的栽培方法，在北方生长季节较短的地区，改一熟棉田为麦棉两熟，势必影响棉花单位产量。据陕西省泾阳县典型调查，大麦茬棉花每亩产量比一熟棉田产量低百分之四十三左右。这种棉田如果种得过多，也势必影响棉花收获量。
    棉花播种季节很快就要到来了，各地应迅速做好种棉准备工作，提高棉田播种质量，争取种一亩收一亩，尽力减少废弃棉田面积。
