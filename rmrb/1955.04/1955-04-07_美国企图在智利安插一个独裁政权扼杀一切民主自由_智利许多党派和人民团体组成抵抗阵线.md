Xinhua News Agency, April 5th, TASS Buenos Aires, April 4th: According to Chilean newspapers, a tense situation has arisen in Chile due to attempts by reactionary pro-American elements to overthrow the parliament, establish a military regime, and stifle all democratic freedoms. The Chilean magazine "Flash" reported that a group of officers from the Chilean Military School has organized an underground organization called "Straight Line" within the Chilean army, with the aim of establishing a regime in Chile modeled after the reactionary regime in Venezuela, which, as everyone knows, has sold the country to American monopoly capital. The Chilean "Century Newspaper," commenting on the situation in Chile, wrote: "We are facing a grave danger of an anti-constitutional coup d'état, the purpose of which is to realize the plan of the American imperialists to install a subservient dictatorial regime in every Latin American country." The reactionary plan is being resolutely resisted by the Chilean people. According to newspaper reports, the Workers' Federation of Chile, the Student Federation of Chile, the Production and Sales Confederation, the People's Socialist Party, the Chilean People's Front, and several other political parties have organized a front to resist the planned coup. The center of the resistance front includes leaders of several political parties and organizations, as well as many members of parliament led by Salvador Allende, a member of the World Peace Council, and Baltasar Castro. Large and small gatherings are being held throughout the country in support of the resistance front.

    新华社五日讯　塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯四日讯：据智利报刊报道，由于反动的亲美分子企图推翻国会，在智利建立一个军事政权并且扼杀一切民主自由，在智利境内已经造成了紧张的局势。智利“闪烁”杂志报道，智利军事学校的一批军官已经在智利军队中组织了一个名为“直线”的地下组织，目的是要在智利建立一个以委内瑞拉反动政权为榜样的政权，而大家知道，委内瑞拉反动政权已经把国家出卖给美国垄断资本。智利“世纪报”在评论智利局势时写道：“我们面临着一个反宪法的政变的严重危险，这种政变的目的是要实现美帝国主义者要在每个拉丁美洲国家中安插一个卑躬屈膝的独裁政权的计划。”反动派的计划正遭到智利人民的坚决反抗。报刊消息说，智利劳动人民工会联合会、智利学生联合会、产销联合会，人民社会党、智利人民战线以及若干其他政党已经组织了一个阵线，以抵抗计划中的政变。抵抗阵线的中心包括若干政党和团体的领袖以及以世界和平理事会理事萨尔瓦多·阿伦德和巴尔塔沙尔，卡斯特罗为首的许多国会议员。现在全国各地都在举行支持抵抗阵线的大小集会。
