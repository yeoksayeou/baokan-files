The cable stated that on the occasion of the opening of the conference of representatives of Asian and African countries, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea extends its congratulations to the representatives attending the conference.

The Korean people, along with all peace-loving people in the world, warmly welcome and support the convening of this conference. This conference reflects the desire and will of the Asian and African people, who account for more than half of humanity and have entered a new historical era, to firmly grasp their own destiny.

The convening of the Asian-African Conference, and the discussions by Asian and African countries on ways to contribute to the rational resolution of political, economic, cultural, and other issues of particular concern to the peoples of Asia and Africa, as well as on comprehensive peace and cooperation, will have great positive significance for the cause of peace in Asia and Africa and for world peace and security.

The entire Korean people—who yearn for the peace, unification, and independence of their own country and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and who expect the establishment of friendly and cooperative relations between countries—are confident that this conference will greatly help promote the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. For the sake of peace in Asia and the world, the Korean issue should be resolved as soon as possible. The entire Korean people await with great concern the smooth discussion and resolution by the conference of issues concerning peace in Asia, Africa, and the world, and the freedom and prosperity of the peoples of the Asian and African regions.

I sincerely congratulate the conference on achieving results in solving the urgent tasks it faces.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 19th: According to TASS, Moscow, April 18th: Kuratov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic, and N. Dodkhudoyev, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic, sent telegrams to the Presidium of the Asian-African Conference to express congratulations.

Kuratov's congratulatory telegram stated that thirty-seven years ago, the Kirghiz people were in the shackles of colonial oppression, without rights, impoverished, and on the verge of extinction. Now, the free Kirghiz people live in the happy and equal family of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, and are successfully developing their own economy and national culture. The Kirghiz people hope that the Asian-African Conference will help the peaceful and independent development of Asian and African countries, and help expand economic and cultural cooperation between Asian and African countries, in order to consolidate international peace.

Dodkhudoyev's congratulatory telegram stated that the free and happy Tajik people deeply sympathize with the struggle of the people of Asian and African countries for political, economic, and cultural independence, and the struggle for the prosperity and peaceful development of Asian and African countries.

Their congratulatory telegrams both wished the Asian-African Conference success.
