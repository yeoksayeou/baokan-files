Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 16th: On the eve of the Asian-African Conference, attention is particularly being paid here to the American conspiracy to sabotage the conference by utilizing armed bandits of the Indonesian "Darul Islam" movement, which is based in the Bandung area. According to "Indonesia News," the Indonesian government has detected that these bandits have a plan to sabotage the Asian-African Conference. Jakarta newspapers report that they have been ordered to attack Bandung as part of the plan to disrupt the Asian-African Conference. According to Reuters, these bandits have been very active recently, with daily attacks on villages occurring near Bandung.

The "Darul Islam" movement has always been a tool used by the United States to carry out subversive activities against the Indonesian government. The "Delhi Times" weekly reported last year that the armed forces of the "Darul Islam" movement are completely controlled and equipped by the United States, and an FBI agent in the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia is responsible for maintaining close contact with the headquarters of the "Darul Islam" movement. During the Indonesian government's interrogation of captured "Darul Islam" rebels this year, they confessed that the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia and Mobil Oil Company had repeatedly sent planes to airdrop weapons and food to them and provide them with operating funds. The "Darul Islam" movement also has a "representative" stationed in the United States. In February of this year, foreign aircraft and warships were constantly discovered near the base of the "Darul Islam" movement. At that time, the Indonesian government seized a batch of unreported heavy weapons, such as anti-aircraft guns and anti-tank guns, on an American ship in Jakarta port. Jakarta newspapers pointed out at the time that these weapons were intended to be supplied to the "Darul Islam" movement.

Recently, Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents, the running dogs of the United States, have also been intensifying their contact with the "Darul Islam" movement. Chiang Kai-shek's secret service organization, the "Iron Blood Corps," is actively plotting to sabotage the Asian-African Conference together with these bandits.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 16th: "Indonesia News" reported on the 15th that as the Asian-African Conference is about to be held, suspicious nighttime meetings have been discovered near Bandung. The report said that the secret meetings, which often last until late at night, are attended by foreigners and "foreign journalists" who recently arrived in Bandung.

The report pointed out that the gathering place is in Pengalengan, 22 kilometers south of Bandung, where social order is very bad due to the recent harassment by armed bandits of the "Darul Islam" movement.

While pointing out the recent plane crash carrying personnel and journalists from the Chinese delegation attending the Asian-African Conference, and the intensified bandit activities in West Java, especially near Bandung, "Indonesia News" urged the relevant authorities to take effective measures to prevent possible sabotage activities.

    美国策划破坏亚非会议的新阴谋
    阴谋利用武装匪徒攻击亚非会议开会地点万隆
    新华社雅加达十六日电　在亚非会议前夕，此间特别注意美国利用以万隆一带为根据地的印度尼西亚“回教国运动”的武装匪徒破坏会议的阴谋。据“印度尼西亚新闻”报道，印度尼西亚政府已侦查出这些匪徒订有破坏亚非会议的计划。雅加达报纸消息说，他们已奉命攻击万隆，作为破坏亚非会议计划的一部分。据路透社消息称，最近这些匪徒很活跃，万隆附近每天都发生袭击村庄的事件。
      “回教国运动”一向是美国利用来对印度尼西亚政府进行颠覆活动的工具。“德里时代”周刊去年曾报道，“回教国运动”的武装力量完全由美国控制，并由美国装备，美国驻印度尼西亚大使馆中的一个属于联邦调查局的人员负责和“回教国运动”总部保持密切联系。今年印度尼西亚政府审讯捉到的“回教国运动”叛乱分子时，据他们供称，美国驻印度尼西亚大使馆和美孚油公司曾多次派飞机给他们空投军火、粮食，并供给他们活动经费。“回教国运动”还在美国驻有一个“代表”。今年二月间，在“回教国运动”根据地附近不断发现外国飞机和军舰。就在那个时候，印度尼西亚政府在雅加达港口的一艘美国轮船上破获一批未经报告的高射炮和反坦克炮等重武器。当时雅加达报纸指出，这批武器是准备供给“回教国运动”的。
    最近，美国的走狗蒋贼特务分子也在与“回教国运动”加紧接触，蒋贼特务组织“铁血团”正在积极图谋与这些匪徒共同破坏亚非会议。
    新华社雅加达十六日电　“印度尼西亚新闻”十五日报道，在亚非会议快要召开的时候，发觉有人在万隆附近举行可疑的夜间会议。消息说，参加往往开到深夜的秘密会议的是些外国人和最近抵达万隆的“外国记者”。
    消息指出，集会的地点是在万隆南面二十二公里的本加伦岸，由于“回教国运动”武装匪徒最近的骚扰，那个地方的社会秩序很坏。
    “印度尼西亚新闻”在指出最近发生了载运出席亚非会议的中国代表团人员和新闻记者的飞机失事和西爪哇、特别是万隆附近土匪活动加紧等事实时，促请有关当局采取有效的措施来防止可能的破坏活动。
