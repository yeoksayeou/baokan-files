    Shangsuan Township Solves the Problem of Cattle Joining Cooperatives
    By Our Correspondent Liu Shiping
    In Yunnan Province, Jinning County, the Shangsuan Township Party Branch, while inspecting preparations for spring plowing, discovered that out of the 150 head of cattle owned by members of the township's seven agricultural production cooperatives, 144 were thinner than last year. Throughout the township, voices could be heard from cattle-owning households wanting to "sell their cattle" or "return them to the cooperative at a reduced price." This phenomenon is not isolated in Yunnan Province; such voices can also be heard in other villages in Yunnan Province.
    A Detour Taken
    Shangsuan Township is a basically cooperativized township in Yunnan Province, with seven agricultural production cooperatives established in all six villages in the township, and 73 percent of farmers having joined the cooperatives. The Shangsuan Agricultural Production Cooperative is a well-known advanced cooperative in the province. Its director, Li Neng, had visited the Soviet Union and is a delegate to the National People's Congress. This cooperative was established in 1953 on the basis of the Li Xin mutual aid team; in the past two years, it has expanded from twelve households to 252 households, with farmers from all four villages in the township participating in the cooperative.
    Precisely because of this, the cadres working in Shangsuan Township and some cadres of the Shangsuan Agricultural Production Cooperative developed complacency, believing that "members of the advanced cooperative cannot be swept out even with a machine gun." In dealing with the issue of cattle, they simply relied on their subjective wishes, wanting to take a shortcut and block the livelihood of cattle-raising households, forcing them to "return their cattle to the cooperative at a reduced price."
    Before the autumn harvest and planting last year, the Shangsuan Agricultural Production Cooperative lowered the labor price of cattle. The labor price for one mu of land was 1.8 yuan the year before, but it was reduced to 1 yuan last year. After the autumn harvest, they concentrated 40 percent of the straw and did not distribute it to the members. Other tasks such as pulling carts and milling rice were all handled by the cooperative's cattle. However, there were only 19 cooperative-owned cattle, which could not handle all the tasks. When private cattle were used, various restrictions were imposed. Sometimes, members would engage in sideline occupations during slack farming seasons, and the cooperative cadres would arbitrarily label them with the "spontaneous forces of capitalism," without distinguishing between labor and exploitation. The Jinning County Committee cadres stationed in Shangsuan Township frankly said during a self-criticism: "Last year, we kept 40 percent of the straw and did not distribute it, precisely to use it as feed this year after a large number of cattle are returned to the cooperative at a reduced price."
    As a result, the enthusiasm of cattle-owning households to raise cattle was greatly reduced; some people even deliberately shouted that they wanted to "sell their cattle" or "return them to the cooperative at a reduced price." Middle peasant Feng Cunren said: "In the past, I could earn money for fodder through transportation, but would I dare to do that now? They would say I don't care about the cooperative. If the cattle are idle, where would I get money to buy feed!" Poor peasant Li Guomin was so anxious when he heard that the cattle were to be returned to the cooperative at a reduced price that he slapped his thigh and sighed repeatedly, saying: "The policy has changed." There was also a cattle-raising household that had a calf born, which was supposed to be a joyous event, but the woman of the house stared at the calf and threw a "cow temper": "What's the point of being born? It would be better if it died!" She inquired everywhere, wanting to give the calf away to someone else.
    The Policy Has Not Changed
    Later, Li Neng, the Shangsuan Township Party Branch Secretary and Director of the cooperative, returned from a meeting in Kunming and conveyed the spirit of the provincial mutual aid and cooperation representative conference, explaining that the policy of mutual benefit must be implemented in dealing with the issue of cattle. The Party Branch Committee seriously studied the Party's policy and, in conjunction with the preparations for spring plowing, reviewed the handling of the cattle joining the cooperative issue.
    The first to raise the issue was Li Xuegui, a Party Branch Committee member and Secretary of the Communist Youth League Branch. He already knew the thoughts of some of the masses during the tense situation regarding the cattle issue, but he adopted a liberal attitude. This time, he finally revealed these situations. He said: "The cattle-owning households shouting about returning their cattle to the cooperative at a reduced price is not their true thought, but a dissatisfaction with the deviations in our implementation of the policy."
    "Even if the masses like to return the cattle to the cooperative at a reduced price, we have no experience in management," was the view of most of the Party Branch Committee members.
    In order to unify the ideological understanding within the Party, the Party Branch Committee also calculated in detail how raising strong cattle through the implementation of the mutual benefit policy could increase production. They first used the facts of poor peasant Li Fa's wife to calculate an account. In the past, when she was planting rice seedlings, the water had already flooded the fields, and because she could not find cattle, she had to harrow the field and plant the seedlings. During the autumn harvest, she only harvested four dou of grain per mu of land. The fields near hers, because they had been plowed with cattle, yielded more than two dou more than hers. In addition, they calculated an account of the overall production increase for the entire cooperative. Now that it was almost time to transplant rice seedlings, if the cattle were not well-fed, 30 percent of the cooperative's land would not be well-tilled, and more than 500 mu of land would experience reduced yields. At two dou of reduced yield per mu, this would amount to more than 100 shi of grain, which would affect the production increase plan and reduce the income of the members.
    Then, through calculation, they educated all the members. They explained that if the cattle were not in good condition, they would not be able to carry out spring plowing well, and future production would be reduced, resulting in less dividends, which would not benefit anyone.
    From the facts, the members realized that the Party's policy had not changed, and unanimously agreed: "The issue of cattle joining the cooperative should be resolved fairly and reasonably in accordance with the voluntary and mutually beneficial policy."
    Pulled Back From the Detour
    From solving the cattle issue, the Shangsuan Township Party Branch realized that complacency had emerged in its guiding ideology. This was specifically manifested in the conscious lowering of cattle prices when dealing with the cattle issue; they originally wanted to take a shortcut, but ended up taking a detour. Therefore, when resolving issues such as the transportation, feed, grazing, labor price, and joining the cooperative of cattle, they fully promoted democracy. Regarding the issue of cattle joining the cooperative, everyone agreed to adopt the method of private ownership and self-raising, with public use. Regarding the issue of labor price, based on the past practices in the township, the general payment for plowing one mu of land was 1.4 yuan, and they also prepared to organize cattle-owning households for transportation to increase sideline income. In this way, after offsetting expenses, each cattle could still have a surplus of more than 18.2 yuan per year, excluding the income from transportation. With these issues resolved reasonably, the members' enthusiasm for raising cattle greatly increased. They unanimously reflected: "If this policy had been implemented earlier, the cattle would have been stronger earlier. This time, we must raise the cattle well!"
    After the Shangsuan Agricultural Production Cooperative resolved the cattle issue, the cattle issues of the other cooperatives in the township were also resolved reasonably. Currently, 98 head of cattle from 98 households in various cooperatives throughout the township have been organized for transportation without affecting production; seven households have added cattle carts. Li Shuchun, a member, also took out the cattle cart that he had hidden for two years and used it. Li Shaoqing, the Deputy Director of the Fifth Cooperative, is also busy buying cattle. The township has already invested in and purchased more than 14,000 bundles of cattle grass, all the cattle have begun to be fed with beans to gain weight, and collective grazing has been organized.

    上蒜乡解决了耕牛入社问题
    本报记者　刘时平
    云南省晋宁县上蒜乡党支部在检查春耕生产准备工作时，发现全乡七个农业生产合作社的社员的一百五十头耕牛，有一百四十四头比去年瘦了。在这个乡里到处可以听到有牛户要“卖牛”或“折价归社”的声音。这种现象在云南省并不是个别的；这种声音在云南省别的乡村里也可以听到。
    走了一段弯路
    上蒜乡是云南省一个基本上合作化了的乡，全乡六个村成立了七个农业生产合作社，有百分之七十三的农户都入了社。上蒜农业生产合作社是闻名全省的一个先进社。社长李能曾经到苏联参观过，又是全国人民代表大会代表。这个社是一九五三年在李信互助组的基础上建立起来的；两年来已从十二户扩大到了二百五十二户，全乡四个村子的农户参加了这个社。
    正因为如此，在上蒜乡帮助工作的干部和上蒜农业生产合作社的部分干部产生了自满情绪，认为“先进社”的“社员用机关枪也扫不出去了”。他们在处理耕牛问题上，简单地凭自己的主观愿望，想走近路，把养牛户的活路堵死，逼着养牛户把耕牛“折价归社”。
    去年秋收秋种前，上蒜农业生产合作社把牛的工价压低，前年一亩田地的工价一元八角，去年压低到一元；秋收后，又把百分之四十的稻草集中起来，不分给社员；其他拉车、碾米都由公牛包办。可是公牛只有十九头，包办不下来；使用私牛时，又用各种办法限制，有时社员利用农闲时间，去搞点副业，社干部不分劳动和剥削的界限，随便给人家乱扣“自发势力”的帽子。晋宁县委派驻在上蒜乡的干部，在检查思想时，坦白地说：“去年把稻草留下百分之四十，没有分下去，就是准备今年耕牛大批折价入社后，把它用作饲料。”
    这样做的结果，使有牛户养牛的积极性大大降低；有些人还故意叫喊要“卖牛”或“折价归社”。中农冯存仁表示：“往年搞运输，有钱买料加膘，现在去搞吗？会说我不关心社，牛闲起，那里有钱买饲料！”贫农李国民，听说要把牛折价归社，急得拍腿叹气，连声说：“政策变了。”还有一家养牛户，生了一条小牛，本来是一件喜事，可是，那家妇女盯着小牛，发“牛脾气”：“生下来整那个，死了算啦！”她到处打听，想把小牛送给别人。
    政策没有变
    后来，中共上蒜乡支部书记兼社长李能，从昆明开会回来，传达了省互助合作代表会议的精神，说明处理耕牛问题，一定要贯彻互利政策；支委会认真地学习了党的政策，结合春耕准备工作，对处理耕牛入社问题进行了检查。
    首先提出问题的是支委兼青年团支书李学贵，他在耕牛问题紧张的时候，已经知道一些群众的思想情况，却采取了自由主义的态度。这次他才把这些情况说出来。他说：“有牛户叫喊耕牛折价归社，不是真实思想，是对我们执行政策上的偏差不满。”
    “就是群众喜欢折价入社，我们在管理上，也没有经验。”这是多数支委的看法。
    支委会为了统一党内的思想认识，还算了贯彻互利政策养壮牛来增产的细账。他们首先以贫农李发老婆的事实算了一笔账。过去，她在栽秧时，水已灌到田里，因为找不到牛，只好耙一下，把秧栽下去，秋收的时候，一亩田只收了四斗谷子；靠近她的田，因为用牛耕过，比她多收了二斗多。另外，又算了一笔全社的增产账，现在眼看就要插秧了，如果牛喂不好，全社有三成田耕不好，就有五百来亩田减产，以每亩减产二斗算，合一百多石谷子，这样就会影响增产计划和减少社员的收入。
    接着又通过算账，向全体社员进行了教育。说明牛没有膘就不能很好进行春耕，将来减了产，就要少分红，这样对大家都没有好处。
    社员们从事实中，认识了党的政策并没有变，一致同意：“耕牛入社问题，要照自愿互利政策，公平合理解决。”
    从弯路上拉回来
    上蒜乡党支部从解决耕牛问题中，认识到在领导思想中曾经产生过自满情绪。这具体地表现在处理耕牛问题时，有意识地压低牛价；本来想走近路，结果绕了一段弯路。因此在解决耕牛的运输、饲料、放牧和工价、入社等问题时，充分发扬了民主。对耕牛入社问题大家同意采用私有自养、公用的办法。对工价问题，根据本乡过去的惯例，采取犁一亩田一般付工价一元四角，同时还准备组织有牛户运输，增加副业收入。这样每头牛除搞运输收入不算外，每年收支相抵，还可剩十八元二角以上。合理解决了这些问题，社员养牛的积极性就大大提高。一致反映：“这个政策早点执行，牛早会壮一些呢，这回可要把牛养壮啦！”
    在上蒜农业生产合作社解决耕牛问题之后，这个乡其他几个社的耕牛问题也得到了合理解决。目前全乡各社已有九十八户的九十八条牛在不影响生产的情况下，组织了运输；有七户人家添制了牛车。社员李树春把藏起两年的牛车，也拿出来用了。第五社副社长李少清也忙着买牛了。全乡已由社员投资买进了一万四千多捆牛草，全部耕牛已开始喂豆加膘，并组织集体放牧。
