    How the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory Wasted National Funds
    Feng Zhongying, Zhou Hongsheng
    On March 2nd, the People's Daily published an article entitled "A Low-Quality, Wasteful Factory," exposing the serious waste at the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the broad masses. As Comrade Zhang Jing of the National Economic Comprehensive Planning Bureau of the State Planning Commission said, this kind of waste "objectively played a role in undermining the national construction plan." Regarding the factory's waste, let us now talk about what we know from our credit work.
    Looking at the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory's stockpiled materials, finished products, and semi-finished products, valued at more than 12.34 million yuan, it exceeds the normal funding needs by one and a half times. In other words, this 12.34 million yuan could also supply one and a half equally sized high-voltage switch factories with working capital. How did they obtain this huge amount of funds?
    First, they expanded the funding quota and requested appropriations. For example, if the factory's funding quota at the end of 1953 was 100, it had expanded to 185 by the end of 1954. If the appropriation in 1953 was 100, the appropriation had risen to 182 by the end of 1954. However, relying solely on government appropriations could not solve the factory's capital turnover problem. This required relying on national bank credit to solve. By the end of August 1954, bank credit had risen from 8.05 million yuan at the end of 1953 to nearly 10 million yuan. The factory obtained these credit funds by using objective reasons such as quality problems, technical problems, dedicated materials that could not be processed, and complex procurement as excuses. This turned bank credit into the factory's long-term investment. In its credit work, the bank not only made several verbal suggestions to the factory, but also suggested in writing that the factory actively handle the stockpiles exceeding the reserve amount. However, the factory emphasized objective reasons and did not pay attention to handling them. Of course, the bank did not do enough to further exert the role of credit supervision and conduct in-depth investigation and analysis. In recent years, the state has done a lot of work to eliminate commercial credit. However, commercial credit still exists at the High-Voltage Switch Factory. For example, at the end of 1953, they borrowed 500,000 yuan from the Northeast Supply Office, and in February 1954, they borrowed 1 million yuan from the First Ministry of Machine Building. Not only that, but they also occupied a large number of loans from factories such as the Electrical Machinery Factory and the Harbin Electric Motor Factory, which also affected the capital turnover and planned use of other factories. Socialist accumulation is a major task of enterprises, and it is also an important source of funds for realizing socialist industrialization. However, the High-Voltage Switch Factory often occupies the funds that should be turned over. This affects the state treasury revenue and wastes national construction funds. Their practice is worthy of being taken as a warning by all state-owned enterprises.

    沈阳高压开关厂怎样浪费了国家资金
    冯仲英　周洪生
    三月二日，人民日报刊载“一个质量低劣、浪费严重的工厂”一文，揭露了沈阳高压开关厂严重浪费的情况，引起了广大群众的不满。正如国家计划委员会国民经济综合计划局张兢同志所说，这种浪费“在客观上起了破坏国家建设计划的作用”。关于该厂的浪费，现在我们再把从信贷工作中所知道的情况谈一下吧。
    以沈阳高压开关厂积压的材料、成品、半成品价值一千二百三十四万多元来看，就超过正常需要资金的一倍半。也就是说，这一千二百三十四万多元资金还可以供给一个半同样大的高压开关厂做流动资金。这笔数目巨大的资金，他们是怎样取得的呢？
    首先是扩大资金定额要求拨款。如以这个厂一九五三年末的资金定额为一百，一九五四年末已扩大到一百八十五。以一九五三年的拨款为一百，到一九五四年末拨款已上升至一百八十二。可是单靠政府拨款是不能解决这个厂的资金周转问题的，这就必须依靠国家银行信贷来解决。在一九五四年八月末，银行信贷已由一九五三年末八百零五万元上升到近一千万元。这些信贷资金是这个厂以质量问题、技术问题、材料专用不能处理，采购复杂等等客观原因为借口取得的。这就使银行信贷变成了这个厂的长期投资。银行在信贷工作中除向这个厂提出过多次口头建议外，还书面建议这个厂积极处理超过储备量的积压。但该厂却强调客观原因，没有注意处理。当然银行对进一步发挥信贷监督的作用，深入调查研究分析是做得不够的。几年来，国家为了消灭商业信用，曾做了很多工作。然而高压开关厂仍然有商业信用存在。例如，一九五三年末他们曾向东北供应办事处借了五十万元，一九五四年二月份向第一机械工业部借了一百万元。不但如此，还占用电工机械厂、哈尔滨电机等厂的大批贷款，这样也就影响其他厂的资金周转和有计划的运用。社会主义积累是企业的一项主要任务，也就是实现社会主义工业化资金的重要来源。但高压开关厂却经常占用上缴资金。这样就影响了国库收入，浪费了国家的建设资金。他们的做法是值得所有的国营企业引以为戒的。
