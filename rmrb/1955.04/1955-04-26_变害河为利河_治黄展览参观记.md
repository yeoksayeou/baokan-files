Turning a River of Calamity into a River of Benefit
    — A Visit to the Yellow River Management Exhibition
  　Xinhua News Agency reporter Jun Qian
    The Yellow River Management Exhibition opened in Zhengzhou on April 17th. As people entered the exhibition hall accompanied by the sounds of the Yellow River Cantata, they were immediately drawn to the six large characters "Turning a River of Calamity into a River of Benefit" hanging high above the entrance. The exhibition hall displayed photographs of the Tanglai Canal in Gansu Province, the Longmen Grottoes in Luoyang, a model of the "Great Yellow River," and an animated model of the "Overview and Historical Changes of the Yellow River Basin." It told people that the Yellow River is our country's second largest river, with a total length of over 9,700 li; its basin area is over 700,000 square kilometers, and the Yellow River basin is home to 180 million people. The Yellow River banks are the main production areas for wheat, millet, and cotton in our country; they are rich in tobacco and a large amount of livestock products; and underground, there are abundant mineral resources such as coal and iron.
    The Yellow River was originally a great treasure of our people, but due to the long-term destruction by the reactionary rulers of past dynasties, the ancient forests and large grasslands in the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River were severely damaged, and soil erosion became increasingly serious, which made the Yellow River a suspended river prone to siltation and breaches.
    The audience then saw the great achievements of the people in managing the Yellow River from the exhibition. Animated models told people that the total investment in the people's management of the Yellow River in the past nine years is equivalent to dozens of times the investment during the reactionary rule period from 1914 to 1932, and the funds used for fundamental treatment preparations, soil and water conservation, and water conservancy construction have been increasing year by year. By 1954, more than 3,000 li of dikes had been repaired in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, and the body of the Yellow River dikes was already 1.5 to 3 meters higher than the 1933 flood level. The original straw and reed dikes along the Yellow River dikes in the lower reaches have now been replaced with stone dikes. Over the past nine years, the workers managing the Yellow River have conducted cone penetration tests on the dikes, discovered more than 80,000 cave-ins inside the dikes, and repaired and filled them in time, making the Yellow River dikes more solid and reliable, and the flood defense capacity of the dikes has gradually improved, thus winning the miracle of safely passing eight major floods. In recent years, the Shitou Zhuang flood diversion weir project and the Dongping and Liangshan flood storage areas built in the lower reaches of the Yellow River have also prepared for the defense of abnormal floods with a flow rate of 23,000 cubic meters per second. The exhibition also featured the famous Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project for Jinan and Weihui. It can now release water to irrigate more than 600,000 mu of farmland in Wuzhi, Xinxiang, and other counties. The increase in agricultural production in the irrigated area in the autumn of 1952, and the wheat seasons of 1953 and 1954 reached 8.8 million yuan. After the Yellow River water was diverted to regulate the water volume of the Weihui River, the 930-kilometer waterway from Xinxiang to Tianjin and Tanggu could maintain a normal water level during the dry season, and the freight volume greatly increased. The exhibition also showcased other water conservancy projects undertaken in the lower reaches of the Yellow River in the past few years. The Hongqikou Siphon Diversion Project completed at the end of 1953 changed the environmental sanitation of Kaifeng City, and the Yellow River water irrigated more than 20,000 mu of land around Kaifeng City, and the industrial water for Kaifeng City also received a sufficient source. Other projects include the Lijin County Siphon Diversion Project in Shandong Province and the Songjin River Control Gate in Heze Prefecture.
    The part of the soil and water conservation work carried out in the Yellow River basin exhibited at the meeting gave people an account: the silt washed away from the middle reaches of the Yellow River every year is transported through Shanzhou to the lower reaches and into the sea, totaling 1.38 billion tons. This makes the river channel in the lower reaches of the Yellow River prone to siltation and difficult to manage; the loess plateau area in the middle reaches is severely eroded, with thousands of gullies and ravines. In 1950, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission began to establish soil and water conservation experimental stations in Gansu, Shaanxi, and other places, mobilizing local farmers to plant trees, plant grass, and build terraced fields on slopes, so that "water does not go down the plateau, soil does not go down the slope, and mud does not go out of the gully," which greatly reduced soil erosion and created conditions for fundamentally controlling the Yellow River. The exhibits then told the audience about the efforts people have made in hydrological work and sediment research to understand the symptoms of the Yellow River. Since the people began to manage the Yellow River, they have successively established 200 hydrological stations and 400 rainfall stations in the Yellow River's trunk and tributaries, forming a hydrological control network for the entire river, so that reliable data can be obtained quickly and in a timely manner during the flood season every year to prepare for flood forecasting. At the same time, the hydrological workers along the Yellow River have also compiled the hydrological data of the Yellow River from 1919 to 1952, and analyzed several famous floods in history, providing valuable hydrological data for future flood control and fundamental treatment projects. The vast number of employees participating in hydrological and sediment research work have demonstrated their socialist work enthusiasm and invented and created many new instruments. For example, the rainfall alarm bell created by workers at the Tongguan Hydrological Station can automatically inform indoor workers of the start and stop time of rainfall, and the person in charge of rainfall does not have to guard the rain gauge day and night. The Sediment Research Institute established by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission has gained an understanding of the source, characteristics, and operating rules of the Yellow River sediment, making a significant contribution to the fundamental treatment of the Yellow River.
    When the audience entered the second exhibition room, they saw the achievements made by the people participating in the management of the Yellow River in surveying, drilling, and reconnaissance work. Here, there were various instruments for surveying, models of the tense scenes of measuring and drilling day and night in the dangerous mountains and rivers of Sanmenxia, stones taken from the source of the river after traveling thousands of mountains and rivers, and fish fossils from 70 million years ago collected from Ansai County, northern Shaanxi. The surveying team, which has grown to more than 1,000 people, has completed 46,000 square kilometers of topographic surveys and 5,200 square kilometers of precise leveling surveys in the past five years. A large number of reconnaissance teams have traveled throughout the Yellow River basin, crossed countless mountains and ridges, and rapid and dangerous beaches, with a total reconnaissance area of 42,000 square kilometers and a reconnaissance river channel of 21,600 kilometers. The drilling team, which often works hard in the canyons, has drilled dozens of dam sites with a total depth of 14,000 meters.
    The exhibits in the third exhibition room were particularly attractive to the audience. It also vividly illustrated the happy prospects of the people transforming the Yellow River: in the future, the turbid Yellow River water will become clear water, and the disasters of breaches and changes in course will become historical terms; the cheap electricity generated by a large number of hydropower stations can promote the development of urban and industrial and mining economies along the river; reservoirs and impoundment dams can enable many new large irrigation areas to appear along the river; in the thousands of miles of river channels in the middle and lower reaches, sailboats and steamships with sails and horns can travel unimpeded; and the arid plateau areas in the northwest will become prosperous and beautiful with favorable weather.
    The mechanical exhibition area displays a set of mobile factories such as power vehicles, fitter vehicles, forging vehicles, and repair vehicles, as well as drilling machines, water pumps for drilling, and other machinery. From here, the audience understood the country's determination to manage the Yellow River, the huge investment in Yellow River management, and the scale of Yellow River management.

    变害河为利河
    ——治黄展览参观记
  　新华社记者　君谦
    治黄展览会在四月十七日在郑州市开幕了。当人们伴随着黄河大合唱的歌声走进展览馆时，首先就被高悬在门上的“变害河为利河”六个大字强烈地吸引着。展览馆里陈列有甘肃省唐徕渠、洛阳龙门石佛等照片，有“伟大的黄河”模型，有“黄河流域概况和历代变迁示意图”电动模型。它告诉人们：黄河是我们祖国的第二条大河，全长九千七百多里；流域面积七十多万平方公里，黄河流域居住有一亿八千万人口。黄河两岸是我国的小麦、谷子和棉花的主要产区；这里盛产烟叶和大宗的畜产品；地下蕴藏有煤、铁等丰富的矿产资源。
    黄河原是我国人民的一大财富，只是在历代的反动统治者长期摧残下，黄河中、上游古代的森林和大片的草原遭到严重破坏，水土流失日益加重，才使黄河成为多淤善决的悬河。
    观众们接着从展览会上看到了人民治黄的巨大成就。电动模型告诉人们：人民治黄九年的总投资，相当于反动统治时期一九一四年到一九三二年的几十倍，其中用于治本准备、水土保持、兴修水利等项的经费，是逐年增多的。到一九五四年，黄河下游共培修了三千多里的大堤，黄河大堤的堤身已高出一九三三年洪水位一点五公尺到三公尺。黄河下游堤防沿线原有的秸料坝埽，现在已经改为石料坝埽。九年来治黄的工人对大堤普遍进行了锥探工作，发现堤身内部洞穴八万多处及时加以整修和填补，使黄河大堤更加坚实可靠，大堤防御洪水的能力逐步提高，从而赢得了安渡八次大汛的奇迹。几年来，黄河下游所修建的石头庄溢洪堰工程和东平、梁山滞洪区，并为防御二万三千秒公方流量的异常洪水做了准备。展览会上还展出了著名的引黄灌溉济卫工程。它现在能放水灌溉武陟、新乡等县六十多万亩农田。灌溉区内在一九五二年秋、一九五三年和一九五四年麦季的农业增产达到了八百八十万元。黄河水被引来调济卫河的水量后，从新乡到天津和塘沽九百三十多公里的航道，在涸水期也能保持正常的水位，货运量大为增加。展览会上还展出过去几年在黄河下游兴办的其他各项水利工程。一九五三年年底完成的黑岗口虹吸管引黄工程，改变了开封市的环境卫生，黄河的水灌溉了开封市周围二万多亩土地，开封市的工业用水也得到了充足的来源。其他还有山东省利津县虹吸管引黄工程和菏泽专区宋金河控制闸等工程。
    会上展出的黄河流域开展水土保持工作的一部分，给人们算了个账：黄河中游地区每年被冲刷的泥沙，经过陕州输送到下游和入海的有十三亿八千万吨。这就使得黄河下游河道多淤，难治；中游黄土高原地区被冲得肢离破碎，千沟万壑。一九五○年黄河水利委员会开始在甘肃、陕西等地建立水土保持实验站，动员当地农民在坡地上植树、种草、修梯田，使“水不下原，土不下坡，泥不出沟”，使泥沙流失大为减少，为根治黄河创造了条件。展出的展览品接着告诉了观众，人们为了摸清黄河的病症，在水文工作和泥沙研究方面所作的努力。人民治黄以来，先后以在黄河干、支流各地建立起二百处水文站、四百处雨量站，构成了全河的水文控制网，以致在每年汛期可以迅速而及时地得到可靠的资料，做好洪水预报。与此同时，黄河沿线的水文工作者又整编了一九一九年到一九五二年黄河的水文资料，对历史上几次著名的大水做了分析，为今后防洪和治本工作工程提供了可贵的水文资料。参加水文和泥沙研究工作的广大职工，在工作中发挥了社会主义劳动热情，发明了和创造了许多新式仪器。如潼关水文站工人创造的降雨警铃，可以把下雨的开始时间和停止时间自动告诉室内工作者，管雨量的人再不用日夜守着降雨计了。黄河水利委员会建立的泥沙研究所，已对黄河泥沙的来源、特点和运行规律有了认识，为根治黄河作出重大贡献。
    当观众们走进第二展览室时，便看到参加治黄的人们在测量、钻探和查勘等工作方面所取得的成就。这里有勘测用的各种仪器，有在险山凶水的三门峡日夜进行测量和钻探的紧张场面的模型，有经过千山万水从河源取回来的石头，有从陕北安塞县采来的七千万年前的鱼化石。已发展到一千多人的测量队，五年来完成了地形测量四万六千平方公里、精密水准测量五千二百平方公里。大批的查勘队，走遍了黄河的全流域，越过了无数崇山峻岭，急流险滩，查勘总面积达四万二千平方公里，查勘河道二万一千六百多公里。经常在峡谷中艰苦工作的钻探队，已经钻探了几十处坝址，总深度达一万四千公尺。
    第三展览室里的展览品特别吸引了观众。它也形象地说明了人民改造黄河后的幸福的远景：将来浑浊的黄水要变为清水，决口和改道的灾难要成为历史名词；大批水电站发出的便宜电力，可推动沿河城市和工矿经济建设的发展；水库和壅水坝可以使沿河出现许多新的大灌溉区；中、下游数千里的河道内，扬帆鸣笛的帆船和轮船，可以畅行无阻；西北土地贫瘠的高原地区，将要变得风调雨顺，美丽富饶。
    机械展览场里陈列着的动力车、钳工车、锻工车、修理车等一套活动工厂，和钻探机、钻探用的抽水机等机械，观众们从这里了解了国家治黄的决心，治黄投资的巨大，治黄的规模。（附图片）
