Starting from "I Pay for My Meals"
  　Zhang Zhong

    When a person does something, they have some reasons as the basis. The reason why some people don't cherish food and waste it arbitrarily now is also because there are some reasons as the basis, making them waste with "justification". One of the important reasons is, "I bought it with my money, I waste it, no one else has the right to interfere." An example of this is an incident that occurred at the construction site of the Beijing Department Store building. At lunchtime on March 24th, a worker named Guo Ximin dropped a steamed bun on the ground. The canteen worker kindly advised him to pick it up, but he said in a firm attitude: "I pay for my meals, it's none of your business!" In some public canteens with meal plans, the phenomenon of wasting food is even more common. Because some people who eat think: anyway, I paid the money, saving it won't benefit me.
    Supported by these reasons, some people peel the skin when eating steamed buns, some people throw away half a piece or half a bowl, or throw it in the drawer and let it mold, all kinds of phenomena exist. It exists among workers, among staff members of state organs, and even among Communist Party members. Some people are not only not ashamed of wasting food, but proud of it, using it to show off their wealth. If this piecemeal personal waste is carefully calculated on a large scale, the number must be astonishing.
    In the old society, it was very common for the exploiting classes to arbitrarily squander things obtained through exploitation and plunder. No one dared to care, and no one could control it. People couldn't stand it, and could only complain behind their backs, express their indignation, or write some poems and articles to satirize it. There were no other solutions.
    But now it is no longer the old society. Today's China is the people's China. The people use their own hands to produce many things, not to provide the reactionary rulers with enjoyment and squandering, but to provide the masses of the people with their own enjoyment. The masses of the people use the fruits of their labor to improve their lives, and at the same time use a part of these fruits of labor to further develop production, to create more happiness and a better future for themselves. This is the great socialist future. The more that is used for developing production, the faster this future will come. The reason why the state advocates thrift and opposes waste is also here.
    Grain is the most important material in the national economy and the people's livelihood. In order to ensure that everyone can get the necessary grain, the state has implemented the system of unified purchase and sales, so that grain merchants cannot manipulate grain and harm the country and the people. But if the masses of the people waste grain themselves, it will also cause problems in the supply of grain. If one person wastes it, others will be affected; if a region or a unit wastes it, other regions and other units will be affected; if workers and state staff members waste it, farmers and other people short of grain will be affected. Today, when our country's grain is not yet so abundant, any phenomenon of wasting grain will increase the difficulties for the national construction cause and postpone the realization of socialist society.
    The money of laborers is the price of their labor, and they have the right to use it to arrange their own lives, which is correct. But our country cannot allow anyone to use money to destroy useful materials, no matter how his money comes from. The United States allows capitalists to use money to buy large quantities of wheat and dump it into the sea to raise grain prices and increase their profits, but our country can never allow such things to happen. Our country's social system is not a system where money is all-powerful, we cannot let money enslave the people and destroy the conditions for the people's survival and development; we must let money serve the common interests and future of the people. The departments in charge of grain supply should find ways to better control grain, distribute and supply grain more rationally, and use strict systems to eliminate all phenomena of wasting grain. At the same time, we must also tell everyone: the saying that grain bought with one's own money can be wasted at will is completely incorrect. If anyone insists on doing so, he should not only be condemned by public opinion, but also be interfered with by the law. Article 14 of our country's constitution solemnly states: "The state prohibits anyone from using private property to undermine public interests." If you buy grain with your own money, if you don't eat it, but waste it, it is destroying the public interest, and anyone has the right to intervene.

### 从“吃饭我拿钱”说起

    从“吃饭我拿钱”说起
  　张重
    一个人做一件事情，都有一些理由作为根据。现在有些人所以对粮食不加爱护，任意浪费，也是因为有一些理由作为根据，使他们浪费起来“理直气壮”。重要的理由之一，是“我用钱买的，我浪费，别人无权过问。”这可以举出北京市百货公司大楼工地的一件事情作例。三月二十四日吃午饭的时候，一个名叫郭希民的工人把一个馒头掉在地上。炊事员同志善意地劝他拣起来，而他却态度强硬地说：“吃饭我拿钱，你管得着吗！”在一些包伙食的公共食堂里，浪费粮食的现象更多一些。因为有些吃饭的人觉得：我反正出了钱，节省下来也不是我的。
    在这些理由的支持下，有些人吃馒头要剥皮，有些人吃剩半块或半碗就扔掉了，或是丢在抽屉里任其霉烂了，各种现象都有。在工人中有，在国家机关工作人员中以至共产党员中也有。有的人不仅不以浪费粮食为耻，反而以此为荣，以此摆阔。这种零碎的个人的浪费如果在大范围内精细地统计一下，数目一定是惊人的。
    在旧社会里，剥削阶级拿剥削和掠夺得来的东西任意挥霍，是十分平常的事。谁也不敢管，也管不了。人们看不惯，也只能背后发发牢骚，表示一下义愤，或者写些诗文讽刺一下。其他办法是没有的。
    但现在已经不是旧社会。现在的中国是人民的中国。人民用自己的双手生产出来许多东西，不是为供反动统治者享乐和挥霍，而是为供人民群众自己享用。人民群众用自己的劳动果实来改善自己的生活，同时也把这些劳动果实的一部分用来进一步发展生产，为自己创造更多的幸福和更美好的前途，这就是伟大的社会主义前途。用于发展生产的这一部分越多，这个前途也就来得越快。国家提倡节约，反对浪费，道理也就在这里。
    粮食是国计民生中最重要的物资。国家为了使每一个人都能得到必要的粮食，已经实行了统购统销的办法，使粮商不能操纵粮食，危害国家和人民。但是如果人民群众自己浪费了粮食，同样会使粮食的供应发生问题。一个人浪费了，别人就要受影响；一个地区、一个单位浪费了，别的地区，别的单位就要受影响；工人和国家工作人员浪费了，农民和其他缺粮的人民就要受影响。在今天我们国家粮食还不是那末充足的时候，任何浪费粮食的现象都会给国家建设事业增加困难，推迟社会主义社会的实现。
    劳动者的钱是自己劳动的代价，他们有权用来安排自己的生活，这是对的。但是我们国家不能允许任何人用钱来毁坏有用的物资，不管他的钱是怎样来的。美国允许资本家用钱买来大量小麦倾在海里以提高粮价，增大自己的利润，我们国家却绝对不能允许这类事情出现。我们国家的社会制度不是金钱万能的制度，我们不能让钱来奴役人民，破坏人民生存和发展的条件；我们要让钱来为人民的共同利益和前途服务。管理粮食供应的部门，应该设法更好地控制粮食，更合理地分配和供应粮食，用严密的制度来消灭一切浪费粮食的现象。同时我们也要告诉所有的人：所谓自己用钱买来的粮食就可以随意浪费的这种说法，是完全不正确的。如果谁硬要这样作，他不仅应该受到舆论的谴责，而且应该受到法律的干涉。我国宪法第十四条庄严地写着：“国家禁止任何人利用私有财产破坏公共利益。”自己用钱买了粮食，如果不是吃了，而是浪费了，那就是破坏了公共利益，任何人也都有权来过问和干涉。
