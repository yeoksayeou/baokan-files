    "Cooperative Temple", "Dongting Forbidden City" and Other Relics

    In the streets and alleys of Changsha, Hunan Province, some new red and green buildings have appeared.

    "This is the 'Cooperative Temple'!" People often say this when they see the office building of the Hunan Provincial Cooperative Affairs Administration from a distance.

    The office building of the Hunan Provincial Cooperative Affairs Administration is a modern three-story building with a mixed cement structure. On the light gray walls of the pebble-dashed building, patterns and longevity characters are carved. The roof is in the style of a red and green temple, like a person wearing modern clothes wearing a colorful melon-skin hat. Under the overlapping, upturned glazed tile eaves, red, yellow, and blue colored flowers are painted. The pillars in front of the door guard the gate. Rushing horses are carved on the railings. In the middle of the corridor paved with smooth terrazzo, several vermilion door frames stand out as isolated. The floor of the grand auditorium is made of precious catalpa and black peach wood, inlaid with patterns, and covered with carpets.

    However, the "beautiful" appearance of the Hunan Provincial Cooperative Affairs Administration cannot compare with the magnificent decoration of the Dongting Lake Project Office building. People entering a narrow alley can see the dazzling palace-style building of the Dongting Lake Project Office. In front of the building, there is a magnificent gatehouse with a glazed roof. Under the gatehouse, four bright vermilion large round pillars stand, emitting dazzling light. Above the gatehouse, lions, tigers, green mountains, and green waters are painted. In the center of the gatehouse, pink "milky white" palace lanterns hang down. On the walls on both sides of the building, two glazed eaves extend out, blocking the windows of the first floor. Above the building, there is also a palace-style roof covering it. Under these layers of roofs and eaves, patterns and flying birds are painted. The ridges have "chiwei" and golden yellow ao fish. The red wooden windows carved with delicate flowers and the smooth terrazzo floor, which is polished into a carpet shape, adorn the entire building very magnificently. This office building, which is called "Dongting Forbidden City" by people, really looks like a newly painted palace left over from the Ming and Qing dynasties.

    After seeing these two buildings, people cannot help but ask: "Why design the office buildings in this way?" The heads and designers of these construction units replied: "This is just to seek the beauty of the buildings." Yes, we do not generally oppose beauty, but we must oppose extravagance and waste; we advocate appropriately pursuing beauty under possible conditions, but we must not disregard the country's financial resources and social needs for the sake of beauty.

    Before the Hunan Provincial Cooperative Affairs Administration built its office building, many cadres were scattered in various parts of Changsha, urgently needing a concentrated place to work. In principle, the construction unit and designers should first consider how to save money to meet the need for centralized office work as much as possible; however, they instead considered the appearance and decoration of the building too much. They changed the wooden windows to steel windows and used terrazzo and pebble-dashed floors and walls. In order to pursue the magnificence of the appearance, they desperately copied the form of temples, wasting many unnecessary expenses and labor. After the building was completed, it could only accommodate more than two hundred people, and the three hundred people living in the Changsha YMCA could not move in. The deputy director of the Hunan Provincial Cooperative Affairs Administration said: "If we had considered economic accounting more at the beginning, and did not build such a temple-style roof, did not build such a good auditorium, and did not do too much decoration, then we could have at least built one more floor and accommodated more people." The fact now is: it wasted money and did not meet people's requirements for centralized office work. The designer of the Dongting Lake Project Office building, in order to express the form of the building, actually copied the style of the palaces of the feudal society era without compromise, completely ignoring the saving of funds and manpower. Because the palace form requires decoration, the carving project on the appearance of the building alone paid carving workers' wages that accounted for 10.46% of the total wages of all buildings. However, these carvings and those luxurious doorposts and overlapping eaves cannot increase the usable area of ​​the house at all.

    Facts like these can only show that the construction units and designers mainly considered the appearance and decoration of the buildings, not the economy and suitability of the houses. A designer painstakingly designed a building for the Hunan Provincial Liaison Office. Because it was necessary to express beautiful outlines on this building, the project was designed very complicatedly, which required a lot of labor and materials. The cost of labor alone would cost tens of thousands of yuan more. The cost of the roof of this building was actually twice as expensive as an ordinary roof. Not only that. This designer, in designing the gate project of the Hunan Provincial People's Committee, actually imitated the appearance of Tiananmen Square in Beijing to show the gate's imposing manner. The wall of this gate is two or three meters thick, and in the middle are three arched round doors through which cars can pass. Above the six-meter-high patterned doors, a roof similar to Tiananmen Square was built. The strange thing is that this gate, called the gate, has no door. Now the gatekeepers are unable to take care of these three open round doors, so they have to erect two wooden railings in front of the round doors on both sides to block the gate. This gate faces a narrow, crowded street, and in fact, it does not show its imposing manner. However, the construction of this gate cost 45,000 yuan.

    Some heads of construction units and some designers say: "No matter what, these appearances and decorations are still necessary after all." We don't know what they mean by necessity. Is the overlapping roof to protect people from the rain? No, everyone knows that one roof is enough to protect from the rain. Is it what the general public needs today to indiscriminately put an ancient coat on a modern concrete structure building and paint some birds, animals, and landscapes? No, the general public neither wants to turn all modern buildings into palaces and temples, nor do they want to appreciate those cumbersome decorations. Is it possible to spend 45,000 yuan to build a gate in order to show so-called "imposing manner"? No, we certainly don't need such "imposing manner" today, what we need are economical and practical houses and gates!

    So what exactly do they mean by necessity? It seems that they just need to "appreciate" those unrealistic "appearances" and "decorations". In a building of a kindergarten, more than forty forms of windows were used. In the miscellaneous projects such as the kitchen, toilets, and gatehouse of a hospital, classical decorations were actually designed. The chimney of a kitchen was also covered with a glazed tile roof, but before long, this emerald green glazed tile roof had been smoked black. In their opinion, this is "beautifying" the kitchen! When a designer was designing the Xinhua Bookstore, he once designed a spacious flower stand facing the street on a concrete structure building. He initially thought that he could plant flowers on the flower stand to highlight the beauty of the building's appearance and let people appreciate it; however, he did not expect that it would not be easy to plant flowers on a concrete building. Now this flower stand worth tens of thousands of yuan has become unusable waste!

    These various appearances and decorations are actually regarded by many people as the modeling art of buildings! Some units are still pursuing this kind of "art" and requiring the construction department to build such gorgeous houses. This is completely a waste of precious materials and waste of state funds, and it is simply a distortion of architectural art.

    “合作庙”、“洞庭故宫”和其他
    陈迹
    在湖南长沙市的大街小巷里，出现了一些新的红红绿绿的楼房。
    “这是‘合作庙’！”人们远远地看到湖南省合作事业管理局的办公大楼时，常常会这样说。
    湖南省合作事业管理局的办公大楼，是一座现代化的混合水泥结构的三层楼房。在碎石面的淡灰色楼房的墙壁上，刻画着花纹和寿字。屋顶是红绿的庙宇式的，好像一位穿着现代服装的人戴了一顶彩色的瓜皮帽。重叠的向外翘起的琉璃瓦的屋檐下面，粉刷了红的黄的和蓝的彩花。门前的台柱，卫护着大门。栏台上雕刻着奔马。铺着光滑的水磨石的走廊中间，支着几个朱红的门架，显得很孤零。大礼堂的地板，是名贵的梓木和黑桃木镶成的，上面有花纹，还铺着地毡。
    可是，湖南省合作事业管理局的“美丽”的外貌，还赶不上洞庭湖工程处大楼的堂皇的装饰。人们走进一条狭窄的小巷，可以看见洞庭湖工程处的灿烂夺目的宫殿式的大楼。楼房门前，立着一座琉璃屋顶的华丽的门楼。门楼下面，竖着四个鲜艳的朱红色的大圆柱，发出耀眼的光亮。门楼上方，绘画了雄狮、猛虎、青山和绿水。门楼中央，垂挂了粉红的“乳白”宫灯。楼房两旁的墙壁上，伸出了两个琉璃屋檐，挡着第一层楼的窗户。楼房上面，又覆罩着宫殿式的屋顶。这些重重叠叠的屋顶和屋檐的下面，都画上了花纹和飞鸟。屋脊上有“鸱尾”，有金黄的鳌鱼。雕有细花的红的木窗和抹成地毡形的水磨石的光滑地面，把整个楼房点缀得十分堂皇。这座被人称做“洞庭故宫”的办公楼，真好像是明清时代遗留下来的重新粉刷了的宫殿。
    人们看了这两座楼房，不禁要问：“为什么要把办公楼设计成这个样子呢？”这些建筑单位的负责人和设计师们答道：“这不过是为了求得建筑物的美观。”是的，我们并不一般地反对美观，但一定要反对铺张浪费；我们主张在可能的条件下适当地讲求美观，但决不能为了美观而不管国家的财力和社会的需要。
    湖南省合作事业管理局在修建办公楼之前，许多干部分散在长沙各地，迫切地需要一个集中的办公的地方。照理说，建筑单位和设计师应该首先考虑怎样节省地使用资金来尽可能地满足集中办公的需要；然而他们却相反地过多地考虑楼房的外貌和装饰。他们把木窗改成钢窗，采用了水磨石和碎石面的地板和墙壁。为了追求外貌的堂皇，拚命地抄袭庙宇的形式，浪费了许多不必要的开支和人工。等到大楼盖好了，只能容纳两百多人，而住在长沙青年会的三百人搬不进来。湖南省合作事业管理局的副局长说：“如果当初我们多考虑些经济核算，不盖那样庙宇式的屋顶，不修那样好的大礼堂，不做过多的装饰，那末我们至少可以多盖一层楼房，多容纳一些人。”现在的事实是：既浪费了钱又没有满足人们集中办公的要求。设计洞庭湖工程处办公楼的设计师，为了表现建筑物的形式，居然不折不扣地抄袭封建社会时代的宫殿的式样，根本不考虑资金和人力的节省。由于宫殿形式需要装饰，仅仅在楼房外貌的雕刻工程中，就支付了占全部建筑物工资总数百分之十点四六的雕刻工工资。然而这些雕刻和那些豪华的门柱以及重叠的屋檐，是不能增加一点点房屋使用面积的。
    像这样的事实，只能说明建筑单位和设计师们考虑的主要不是房舍的经济和适用，而是考虑楼房的外貌和装饰。有个设计师费尽心思地为湖南省交际处设计一栋楼房。因为要在这栋楼房上表现出美丽的轮廓线，把工程设计得非常复杂，需要耗费大量的人工和材料。光是人工的开支，就要多花费几万元。这栋楼房的屋顶的造价，竟比普通屋顶要贵两倍。不仅如此。这个设计师在设计湖南省人民委员会的大门的工程中，竟然仿照北京天安门的模样表现大门的气魄。这座大门的墙有两、三公尺厚，中间是三座拱形的大圆门，汽车可以驶过去。六公尺左右高的绘有花纹的门的上方，盖了一个同天安门样子差不多的屋顶。奇怪的是这座名叫大门的门，却没有门。现在守门的人不好照管这三座空敞的圆门，只好在两旁的圆门前面架设两个木栏来堵住大门。这座大门是面对一个不宽的房屋拥挤的街道，事实上也显不出它的气魄来。但是修建这座大门，却花费了四万五千元。
    有些建筑单位的负责人和某些设计师们都说：
  “不管怎样，这些外貌和装饰，毕竟还是需要的。”我们不知道，他们所指的需要是什么。难道重重叠叠的屋顶，是为了给人挡雨吗？不是的，谁都知道
  一个屋顶就足可挡雨了。难道在现代的混凝土结构的楼房中不加批判地套上一件古人的外衣和粉刷一些飞禽走兽和山水，是今天广大人民所需要的吗？不是的，广大人民既不愿把现代的楼房一律变成宫殿和庙宇，也不愿欣赏那些烦琐的装饰。难道为了表现所谓“气魄”，就可以耗费四万五千元修筑一座大门吗？不可以，我们今天决不需要这样的“气魄”，我们需要的是经济适用的房子和大门！
    那末究竟他们所指的需要是什么呢？看来他们就是需要“欣赏”那些脱离实际的“外貌”和“装饰”。在一个幼儿园的一栋房子里，就采用了四十多种形式的窗子。在一个医院的厨房、厕所和传达室等杂项工程中，居然也设计了古典的装饰。有一所厨房的烟筒也盖上了琉璃瓦顶，可是，还没有多久，这个碧绿的琉璃瓦顶已被烟薰成乌黑色的了。在他们看来，这就是“美化”厨房了吧！有个设计师在设计新华书店时，曾经在一座混凝土结构的楼上，设计了一座面对大街的宽敞的花架。他当初觉得可以在花架上栽花，衬托出楼房外形的美观，让人欣赏；然而他没有想到在混凝土楼上栽花是不容易的。现在这个价值上万元的花架变成不能使用的废物了！
    这种形形色色的外貌和装饰，竟被许多人当成是建筑物的造型艺术！有些单位还在追求这种“艺术”，要求建筑部门修建这样华丽的房屋。这完全是蹧蹋名贵材料和浪费国家资金的做法，这简直是对于建筑艺术的歪曲。
