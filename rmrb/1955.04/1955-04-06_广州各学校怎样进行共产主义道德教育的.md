How Guangzhou Schools Conduct Communist Moral Education
Yang Mingguang

Guangzhou City has conducted a concentrated communist moral education among students in five universities and thirty-six secondary schools throughout the city. This work has now come to an end. This work began in December 1954 and ended in February 1955. During this concentrated education process, twenty-five schools commended good people and good deeds, nineteen schools held parent-teacher conferences, and twenty-two schools conducted work inspections by the Communist Youth League organizations. Through this education, a social consensus has been initially formed, emphasizing the need to strengthen communist moral education for young people and resist the erosion of bourgeois ideology, thereby creating better conditions for long-term communist moral education for young people in the future. After studying, many teachers criticized the erroneous ideas of "teaching without educating people" and "only caring about classroom teaching and not extracurricular activities." On the parents' side, through newspaper publicity, home visits conducted by various schools, and held parent-teacher conferences, they have also begun to pay attention to the education of their children. Some parents have also corrected the mistaken attitude of relying solely on school education. The socialist consciousness of general students has been improved, they attach importance to the cultivation of communist moral character, strengthened collectivist concepts and learning discipline, and improved political enthusiasm. The work style of the Communist Youth League organizations in various schools has also improved. They have paid attention to caring for students' lives and better carrying out cultural, recreational, and sports activities, and have overcome the erroneous attitude of despising, disliking, or even isolating and attacking backward students, thus closely connecting the League and the masses.

Currently, Guangzhou City's work of resisting the erosion of bourgeois ideology and strengthening communist moral education for young people is being carried out in factories, enterprises, and government agencies. In their past work, there are some experiences and insights that are worth referring to in various places.

Strengthening communist moral education for young people and resisting the erosion of bourgeois ideology is a complex and far-reaching task; it is not only a youth issue but also a social issue; not only a life issue but also a political issue, a class struggle issue. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on the unified leadership of the Party committee, organize the forces of all parties, such as the strength of the Communist Youth League organizations, the strength of the government, and social forces (various people's organizations, parents, etc.) to carry it out jointly. In the course of the work, the principle of close cooperation between the Party committee and administrative leadership, the Communist Youth League organization, and all relevant parties should be adhered to. This work in Guangzhou City has been fully supported by the Municipal Party Committee. Under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, a working group composed of the heads of six units, including the Public Security Bureau, the Education Bureau, the Culture Bureau, the Civil Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, was formed to take charge of specific leadership, and obtained close cooperation from other parties. Therefore, this work has been carried out healthily and achieved certain results.

Conducting communist moral education for young people and resisting the erosion of bourgeois ideology is a long-term task; however, it is absolutely necessary to conduct a more concentrated publicity and education within a certain period of time. The time for this concentrated publicity and education should not be too short, and the requirements should not be too high. According to Guangzhou City's experience in this work, the purpose of concentrated publicity and education should be four points: First, to make young people realize the harm of the remnants of the old society and the erosion of bourgeois ideology, and to make young people pay attention to moral cultivation; Second, to severely crack down on the hooligan ringleaders, counter-revolutionary elements, and illegal capitalists who poison young people and undermine social morality and revolutionary order; and gradually transform old entertainment venues and old book stalls selling obscene publications, so as to further eliminate the remnants of the old society; Third, to urge all sectors of society, all relevant agencies, all mass organizations, and the vast majority of parents to pay attention to the education of the younger generation and their own children, and jointly care about the growth of young people's moral character; Fourth, to improve the work style of the Communist Youth League organizations, strengthen education for young people in many ways, and change the erroneous attitude of League members and activists towards the masses, especially young people with backward ideas, and closely connect the League with the vast majority of young people. Before carrying out concentrated publicity and education, it is necessary to do preparatory work, and avoid rushing into it. The so-called full preparation, the first is material preparation. That is, to investigate and study the situation of young people being corrupted and poisoned, to grasp several typical cases with educational significance, to grasp several good and bad typical examples among young people with educational significance, so as to mobilize public opinion and educate young people accordingly. The second is the preparation of backbones. That is, it is necessary to make the Party members, League members, and teachers in various schools fully understand the significance, purpose, policies, and methods of concentrated education, so that they can correctly implement the Party's policies and educate others. The third is to determine a unified work plan under the unified leadership of the Party committee, so that all relevant parties can cooperate. In addition to these, it is also necessary to first do one or two typical examples and accumulate some experience. According to Guangzhou City's experience, only by doing these preparatory work well can the publicity and education work be carried out smoothly, otherwise problems are likely to occur. Initially, in Guangzhou City, due to unclear thinking, there were anxious emotions, and the preparatory work was not done sufficiently. The time arrangement was too short, and the requirements were somewhat too high. Later, under the instructions of the South China Branch of the CPC and the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee, the concentrated publicity and education work was changed to be carried out in batches and in stages, and the requirements were also more practical. However, because the work had already been launched, the backbone preparation work could not be remedied in time, and in addition, the school was about to have final exams, and the time arrangement could not be extended, which affected the effectiveness of the concentrated education in middle schools this time. Improving the work style of the grassroots organizations of the Communist Youth League, making League cadres and League members close to the young masses, and making the League organizations face the vast number of young people are the basic methods to strengthen the communist moral education of young people, and are also one of the purposes of this concentrated publicity and education. In the past, the League's work in Guangzhou schools was often limited to the narrow circle of activists. The existence of this situation is due to the fact that League cadres and League members do not have a sufficient understanding of the League's basic task of assisting the Party to unite and educate the entire younger generation in the spirit of communism, and have adopted incorrect attitudes towards general young people, especially young people with backward ideas, often only seeing their shortcomings and not seeing their advantages. Even many League members believe that young people with backward ideas are hopeless and have a feeling of disgust towards them. Second, League cadres and League members do not have a sufficient understanding that mass cultural and sports activities are an important part of communist education, and rarely care about the cultural life of young people, and do not actively organize, lead, or participate in these activities; in addition, the League's activities are rigid and inflexible, thus making League members more and more divorced from the masses, and at the same time, leaving a great loophole for bad forces to seduce and corrupt young people. At the beginning of Guangzhou City's concentrated publicity and education work in schools, League members and activists had the idea of "rectifying people" and "fighting people." Later, under the instructions of the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee of the CPC, this bias was corrected in a timely manner. Therefore, improving the work style of the League's grassroots cadres, League members, and activists, correcting their thinking, and educating them to correctly treat young people who have been corrupted by bourgeois ideology are the keys to ensuring the smooth progress of this work. In this work in Guangzhou City, the League organizations of various middle schools have designated League members with strong abilities to help students who have been deeply poisoned by bourgeois ideology and patiently enlighten their awareness. Facts have proved that young students who have been poisoned by bourgeois ideology and are infected with hooligan habits are generally not very deeply poisoned. As long as we educate them patiently, they are generally relatively easy to change.

In middle schools, strengthening communist moral education for students should be combined with students' daily learning and life, and carried out frequently through classroom teaching and extracurricular activities. In the work, we must fully pay attention to the characteristics of middle school students. Middle school students are young, have little knowledge, and have little experience in class struggle. Their understanding and acceptance abilities are relatively weak. Therefore, the time for concentrated education for middle school students should be extended (preferably a semester), and the main methods should not be making reports, reading documents, and holding discussion meetings, but should be through teachers' classroom teaching and taking a variety of lively and interesting extracurricular activities. This will not only affect teaching, but also greatly reduce some unnecessary ideological tension and ideological concerns among students, so that better educational results can be obtained.

    广州各学校怎样进行共产主义道德教育的
    杨明光
    广州市在全市五所高等学校、三十六所中等学校学生中，集中地进行了一次共产主义道德教育，现在这一工作已经告一段落。这一工作是从一九五四年十二月开始的，一九五五年二月结束。在这次集中进行教育的过程中，有二十五所学校表扬了好人好事，十九所学校召开过家长会，二十二所学校青年团的组织进行了工作检查。经过这次教育，初步形成了必须加强对青年的共产主义道德教育，抵制资产阶级思想侵蚀的社会舆论，为今后长期对青年进行共产主义道德教育创造了更好的条件。不少教师经过学习，批判了“教书不教人”、“只管课内不管课外”的错误思想。在家长方面，经过报纸的宣传、各校所进行的家庭访问和召开的家长会，也开始重视对自己子女的教育。有的家长并纠正了只依赖学校教育的错误态度。一般学生的社会主义觉悟都有所提高，重视了共产主义道德品质的修养，加强了集体主义观念和学习纪律，提高了政治积极性。各校青年团组织的工作作风也有了改进，已注意关心学生的生活和更好地开展文化娱乐和体育活动，并克服了对落后学生鄙弃厌恶甚至孤立打击的错误态度，因而密切了团和群众的关系。
    目前，广州市的抵制资产阶级思想侵蚀、加强对青年的共产主义道德教育的工作，正在工厂企业和机关中进行。他们在过去一段工作中，有一些经验和体会是值得各地参考的。
    加强对青年的共产主义道德教育，抵制资产阶级的思想侵蚀，是复杂而牵涉方面很广的工作；这不仅是青年问题，而且是社会问题；不仅是生活问题，而且是政治问题，阶级斗争问题。因此必须依靠党委的统一领导，组织各方面的力量，如青年团组织的力量，政府的力量以及社会力量（各人民团体、家长等）来共同进行。在工作进行中并应坚持党委和行政领导，青年团组织及各有关方面密切配合的原则。广州市的这一工作完全得到了市委的支持，在市委的领导下组成了由公安局、教育局、文化局、民政局、市工会、团市委六个单位负责人参加的工作组，负责具体领导，并取得其他方面的密切配合，因而这一工作得以健康地进行，取得一定成绩。
    对青年进行共产主义道德教育，抵制资产阶级的思想侵蚀，是长期的工作；然而，在一定时间内较集中地进行一次宣传教育，是完全必要的。这种集中的宣传教育，时间不宜太短，要求不能过高。根据广州市在这次工作中的经验，集中进行宣传教育的目的，应有以下四点：第一，使青年认识旧社会遗毒和资产阶级思想侵蚀的危害性，使青年注意道德修养；第二，严厉地打击那些毒害青少年，破坏社会公德和革命秩序的流氓头子，反革命分子，不法资本家；并且逐步地改造旧娱乐场所，出售黄色书刊的旧书摊等，以进一步清除旧社会的遗毒；第三，促使社会各阶层、各有关机关、各群众团体和广大家长重视对青年一代和自己子女的教育，共同关心青少年道德品质的成长；第四，改进青年团组织的工作作风，从多方面加强对青年的教育，并改变团员和积极分子对待群众特别是思想落后的青年的错误态度，密切团和广大青年的联系。在进行集中的宣传教育之前，须要做好准备工作，切忌匆促从事。所谓充分准备，第一是材料准备。即调查研究青少年中受腐蚀毒害的情况，掌握若干个有教育意义的典型案件，掌握若干个有教育意义的青少年中的好坏典型例子，以便据以动员舆论和向青年进行教育。第二是骨干准备。即必须使各学校中的党员、团员和教师充分了解集中教育的意义、目的、政策、作法，使他们能够正确地执行党的政策和教育别人。第三是在党委的统一领导下确定一个统一的工作计划，以便各有关方面协同动作。除了这些，还须要先搞一两个典型，积累一些经验。根据广州市的经验，只有做好这些准备工作，才能顺利地开展宣传教育工作，否则就容易发生问题。广州市最初由于思想不够明确，有急躁情绪，准备工作做得不够充分，时间安排太短，要求也有些过高，后经中共华南分局和广州市委指示，把这次集中的宣传教育工作改为分批分期进行，在要求上也实际了些。但因为工作已经展开，骨干准备工作已来不及补救，加之学校即将期考，时间安排不能延长，因而就影响了这次在中学中进行集中教育的效果。改进青年团基层组织的工作作风，使团的干部和团员亲近青年群众，使团的组织面向广大青年，是加强青年的共产主义道德教育的基本办法，也是这次集中进行宣传教育的目的之一。过去，广州市学校团的工作往往局限在积极分子的狭小的圈子里。这种情况的存在，一是由于团的干部和团员对团是协助党以共产主义精神团结教育整个年青一代的基本任务认识得不够，对一般青年特别是思想落后的青年采取了不正确的态度，往往只看到他们的缺点，看不到他们的优点，甚至不少团员认为思想落后的青年不可救药，对他们有着厌恶的情绪。二是由于团的干部和团员对于群众的文化体育活动是共产主义教育的重要组成部分还认识得不够，对青年的文化生活很少关心，不去积极组织领导和参加这些活动；加之团的活动方式生硬呆板，因而就使团员越发脱离群众，同时也就给坏势力勾引腐蚀青年留下了很大的空子。广州市在学校中集中地进行宣传教育工作之初，团员和积极分子有“整人”和“斗人”的思想，后经中共广州市委指示，及时纠正了这种偏向。因此，改进团的基层干部、团员、积极分子的工作作风，端正思想，教育他们正确地对待被资产阶级思想腐蚀的青年，乃是保证顺利进行这一工作的关键。广州市在这次工作中，各中学的团组织，曾指定能力较强的团员帮助受资产阶级思想毒害较深的学生，耐心启发他们的觉悟。事实证明，受资产阶级思想毒害而染有流氓习气的青年学生，一般受毒还不很深，只要我们耐心教育，一般是比较容易改变过来的。
    在中等学校中加强对学生的共产主义道德教育，应结合学生的日常学习和生活，通过课堂教学和课外活动经常地进行。在工作中，必须充分注意中学生的特点。中学生年纪轻、知识少，对阶级斗争还没有什么体会，理解和接受能力都比较弱。因此，对中学生集中进行教育的时间应放长一些（最好是一个学期），在方式方法上主要的不应是作报告、阅读文件、开讨论会，而应是通过教师的课堂教学，并采取多种多样、生动有趣的课外活动方式进行。这样作既不会影响教学，又可大大减少学生中一些不必要的思想紧张和思想顾虑，因而可以得到更好的教育效果。
