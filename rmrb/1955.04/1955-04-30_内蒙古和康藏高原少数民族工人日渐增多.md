    The number of minority workers in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is increasing daily. There are now more than 8,600 minority workers in the region. These workers are distributed in construction, machinery, electrical appliances, leather making, drilling, mining, chemical, and automotive and tractor driving, and other industrial sectors. The Inner Mongolia Mica Asbestos Company's Splitting Plant has 42 Mongolian, Hui, and Manchu workers, all of whom have now mastered the technology. Guan Fengying, a Manchu female worker who was named a model worker in Hohhot in 1954, was originally an ordinary housewife. After joining the factory, she became a skilled worker after more than a year of study with the help of Han technicians. In 1954, she created the four-finger hooking method, which nearly doubled the daily output of splitting. The drilling team led by Mongolian drilling machine captain Batere of the No. 205 Exploration Team completed its plan twelve days ahead of schedule in March this year. Wu En, a Mongolian tractor driver who has been named an autonomous region forestry model worker for three consecutive years, once again set a record for transporting more than 200 cubic meters of timber per trip when transporting timber in the Tu Li River forest area of the Greater Khingan Mountains in the winter of 1954. Hasien, a Mongolian leather making technician at the Inner Mongolia Leather Factory, and everyone else successfully researched and developed the glass pasting method, which expanded the area of each piece of leather by 10 percent, increasing the country's wealth by 47,500 yuan a year.
    The number of Tibetan workers on the Tibetan Plateau is increasing daily. At present, there are about 3,000 Tibetan workers engaged in the Kangzang Highway Improvement Project, various urban construction projects, and various production and transportation departments. With the help of Han workers, they have initially mastered production techniques.
    There are nearly 100 Tibetan workers in various small factories in the Tibet Military Region. The eleven Tibetan workers in the Tibet Military Region Iron and Wood Factory have initially mastered the techniques of fitter and blacksmith. The two Tibetan assembly workers at the Lhasa Power Plant are now able to assemble lines and perform simple line repairs. Two Tibetan workers at the Lhasa Letterpress Printing Factory have learned Tibetan typesetting. Some Tibetan workers at the Lhasa Agricultural Experiment Station have learned to carry out field work such as raising seedlings, fertilizing, and cultivating according to scientific methods. Tibetan interns Cheng Xiwu, Luosang Zeren, and Lengbu at the Lhasa Serum Manufacturing Plant have initially mastered the production methods from blood collection to finished serum products. On the construction site of the Kangzang Highway Improvement Project, a squadron composed of more than 360 Tibetan workers has mastered the technology of building roadbeds, pavements, culverts, and so on.
    The work efficiency of Tibetan workers has increased by about double the average two years ago. Hundreds of Tibetan workers have been named model workers, and dozens of Tibetan workers have become squad leaders and group leaders in road construction and other work.
    Tibetan workers can see movies twice a month, and many people participate in cultural study classes. They receive an average of 1.5 to 5 yuan per day in wages. Various production and construction departments also supply them with daily necessities at low prices. In the Tibetan workers' squadron on the Kangzang Highway Improvement Project site, thirty-three female workers received full-paid maternity leave two years ago, and every mother gave birth in a hospital or medical clinic free of charge, and both mother and child were very healthy.

    内蒙古和康藏高原少数民族工人日渐增多
    现在内蒙古自治区各少数民族工人，已有八千六百多人。这些工人分布在建筑、机械、电器、制革、钻探、采矿、化学以及汽车、拖拉机驾驶等企业部门。内蒙古云母石棉公司剥片厂有四十二名蒙、回、满民族的工人，现都已熟练地掌握了技术。一九五四年被评为呼和浩特市劳动模范的满族女工关凤英，原是一个普通的家庭妇女，入厂后，在汉族技术员帮助下，经过一年多学习，已成了一位技术工人。一九五四年她创造了右手四指勾料法，使剥片一天的生产量提高将近一倍。二○五勘探队蒙族钻探机长巴特尔领导的机台，今年三月份提前十二天完成了计划。一连三年被评为自治区林业劳动模范的蒙族拖拉机手悟恩，一九五四年冬天在大兴安岭图里河林区运材时，又一次创造了每趟拉二百多立方公尺木材的最高运材纪录。内蒙古皮革厂蒙族制革技术员哈斯恩，和大家一起研究玻璃贴板法成功后，每张皮扩大了百分之十的面积，一年可给国家增产四万七千五百元的财富。
    康藏高原上的藏族工人日益增多。目前分布在康藏公路改善工程、各城镇建设工程和各生产、运输部门中的藏族工人约有三千多人。他们在汉族工人帮助下，初步掌握了生产技术。
    在西藏军区各小型工厂里，有将近一百名藏族工人。西藏军区铁木工厂的十一名藏族工人，初步掌握了钳工和锻工的技术。拉萨发电厂的两名藏族装配工人，已能担任装配线路和简单的线路修理工作。拉萨铅印工厂已有两名藏族工人学会了藏文排字。在拉萨农业试验场有些藏族工人已学会了按科学方法进行育苗、施肥、栽培等田间工作。拉萨血清制造厂的藏族实习员程习武、罗桑泽仁和冷布等，已初步掌握了从采血到制成血清成品的生产方法。在康藏公路改善工程工地上，一个由三百六十多名藏族工人组成的中队，已经掌握了修筑路基、路面、涵洞等技术。
    藏族工人的工作效率，平均比两年前提高了一倍左右。有成百名藏族工人被评为劳动模范，几十名藏族工人在筑路等工作中当了分队长和组长。
    藏族工人每月可看到两次电影，许多人参加了文化学习班。他们每天平均得到一元五角到五元的工资。各生产建设部门还廉价供给他们生活日用品。康藏公路改善工程工地上的藏族工人中队，两年中有三十三个女工产前产后得到工资照发的假期，每个产妇都免费在医院或医疗所生产，母子都很健康。（新华社）
