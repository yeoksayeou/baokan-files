    In the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    Cadres Throughout the Soviet Union Apply to Work in Collective Farms
    In order to rapidly transform backward collective farms into advanced ones, many Party organizations, Soviet organs, and leading cadres in industrial and mining enterprises, as well as scholars and experts throughout the Soviet Union, continue to respond to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, applying to go to the countryside to take on leadership roles in agricultural production.
    In Leningrad, 500 leading cadres and experts have already applied to go to the countryside. Among them are Ivanova, who previously served as a district party committee secretary and now works in the state party committee; Igolkin, head of the economics department of the Leningrad Agricultural Institute; Averkiyev, a candidate of agricultural sciences; and Vasilyev, a foreman at a machine-building factory.
    In Moscow and the states of the Belorussian Republic, the number of people applying to participate in agricultural production is constantly increasing. In the past few days, many organs and factories in Moscow have launched mass recommendation campaigns to send the most outstanding personnel to the countryside to directly participate in agricultural production.
    The Soviet Union Published Two Books of Memoirs About Lenin
    Two books of memoirs about Lenin, edited by the Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin Institute of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have been published. One is "Lenin Memoirs by Lenin's Relatives," and the other is Zetkin's "Lenin Memoirs."
    The former is a collection of memoirs written by Lenin's wife, Krupskaya, and Lenin's siblings. The memoirs discuss Lenin's life and activities in various periods.
    Zetkin's "Lenin Memoirs" discusses her meetings with Lenin from 1920 to 1922, and records Lenin's views on issues such as art, culture, the international women's movement, and the German revolutionary movement.
    Many Factories in Korea Achieve New Successes in the First Quarter
    Many major factories and enterprises in the industrial sector of Korea have achieved new successes in the first quarter.
    In the heavy industry sector, the main enterprises of the metallurgical and machine-building industries have completed the first quarter production plan in late March according to the state-specified indicators. The steel production of the first quarter of this year of Chongjin Steel Refinery, the iron and steel base of Korea, nearly doubled, the variety increased by forty percent, and the quality was greatly improved compared with the first quarter of last year. They had completely repaired all the machines and equipment before the war.
    In the light industry sector, many major enterprises have also completed the first quarter production and rehabilitation plans. The workers of Sinuiju Enamel Factory, during the first quarter, while installing many new machines aided by China, overfulfilled the production plan of enamelware.
    Vietnam's Sown Area of Summer Rice This Year Exceeds Last Year
    After the start of the Spring Production Increase and Savings Campaign in Vietnam, the sown area of summer rice in various regions has far exceeded 1954. This laid the foundation for a bumper harvest of the first summer rice crop after the ceasefire. The area sown with summer rice in the Red River Left Bank Region, including Hung Yen, Hai Duong, Kien An, and Thai Binh provinces, increased from more than 65,000 hectares to more than 163,000 hectares after the campaign was launched.
    The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has provided multifaceted assistance to farmers in completing the sowing of summer rice. In the northern region of the Fourth Interzone, the government distributed more than 300 tons of rice seeds, including 150 tons of the Chinese cold-resistant and early-maturing "Nanning Rice" variety, which was very popular among farmers. In the disaster areas caused by the French army in Ha Dong province, the government distributed more than 3,000 tons of relief rice. The Administrative Committee of the Viet Bac Interzone successively sent more than 400 cadres to the countryside to lead production.
    Polish Agricultural Workers Intensively Carry Out Spring Plowing
    Spring field work is underway throughout Poland. The agricultural production cooperatives in Wroclaw province in the southwest started spring sowing first, followed by agricultural laborers in Opole, Poznan, Kielce, Bydgoszcz and other provinces.
    Poland's spring plowing task this year is very arduous. In addition to the original sown area of crops, 150,000 hectares (15 mu per hectare) of cultivated wasteland must also be reclaimed, and 2.5 million hectares of early-maturing potatoes must be sown.
    In order to help agricultural laborers complete these tasks, many important industrial enterprises provide voluntary assistance to machine tractor stations and agricultural production cooperatives.
    During this year's spring sowing period, Polish machine tractor stations will have almost 5,000 more tractors than during last year's spring sowing period. (Xinhua News Agency)

    在苏联和人民民主国家
    苏联各地干部申请到集体农庄工作
    为了迅速把落后的集体农庄变成先进的集体农庄，苏联各地许多共产党组织、苏维埃机关、工矿企业的领导干部和学者、专家等，继续响应苏联共产党中央委员会的号召，申请到农村去担任农业生产的领导工作。
    列宁格勒市已经有五百个领导干部和专家申请到农村去。其中有不久以前担任过区党委书记而现在在州党委会工作的伊凡诺娃，有列宁格勒农业专科学校经济系主任伊戈尔金、农学候补博士阿维尔基耶夫，还有一个机器制造工厂的领班华西里耶夫等。
    在莫斯科市和白俄罗斯共和国各州，申请参加农业生产工作的人数在不断增加。这几天，莫斯科许多机关和工厂正在展开群众性的推荐工作，以便把最优秀的人员派到农村去，直接参加农业生产。
    苏联出版了两本关于列宁的回忆录
    苏联共产党中央委员会马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林学院编辑的两本关于列宁的回忆录已经出版了。一本是“列宁亲属的列宁回忆录”，一本是蔡特金的“列宁回忆录”。
    前一本书是列宁的妻子克鲁普斯卡雅和列宁的姐妹兄弟们写的回忆录的合辑。回忆录谈到了列宁各个时期的生活和活动。
    蔡特金的“列宁回忆录”谈到她在一九二○年到一九二二年同列宁的会见，记述了列宁关于艺术、文化、国际妇女运动、德国革命运动等问题的意见。
    朝鲜许多工厂第一季度取得新成就
    朝鲜工业部门许多主要工厂、企业在第一季度取得了新的成就。
    在重工业部门，金属工业和机械工业的主要企业都已在三月下旬按照国家规定的指标完成了第一季度生产计划。朝鲜的钢铁基地——城津炼钢厂在第一季度已经完全修复了它在战前的全部机器设备。今年第一季度这个厂的钢产量比去年第一季度增加了将近两倍，品种增加了百分之四十，质量也有很大的提高。
    在轻工业部门，许多主要企业也完成了第一季度的生产计划和恢复建设计划。新义州搪瓷工厂的工人们在第一季度中，在安装了中国援助的许多新式机器的同时，超额完成了搪瓷器的生产计划。
    越南今年播种的夏稻面积超过去年
    越南春季增产节约竞赛运动开始后，各地播种夏稻的面积已远远超过一九五四年。这给停战后第一季夏稻的丰收打下了基础。包括兴安、海阳、建安、太平四省的红河左岸区，在运动开展后播种夏稻的面积由六万五千多公顷增加到十六万三千多公顷。
    越南民主共和国政府曾多方面帮助农民完成夏稻的播种工作。在第四联区北部地区，政府共发放了三百多吨稻种，其中有一百五十吨是中国的耐寒、早收的“南宁稻”种，很受农民的欢迎。在河东省法军所造成的灾区，政府先后发放了三千多吨救济米；越北联区行政委员会曾先后派四百多个干部下乡领导生产。
    波兰农业劳动者紧张进行春耕工作
    波兰全国各地正在进行春季田间工作。首先开始春播的是西南部的弗罗茨拉夫省的农业生产合作社，接着奥波尔、波兹南、基埃尔塞、比得哥煦等省的农业劳动者也开始了春播。
    波兰今年的春耕任务十分艰巨，除了原来的农作物播种面积外，还要开垦十五万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）熟荒地，播种二百五十万公顷早熟的马铃薯。
    为了帮助农业劳动者完成这些任务，许多重要的工业企业都对机器拖拉机站和农业生产合作社进行义务帮助。
    今年春播期间，波兰机器拖拉机站所拥有的拖拉机差不多比去年春播期间增加了五千台。 （据新华社讯）
