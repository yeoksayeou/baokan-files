Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: The Japanese Communist Party's central organ, "Akahata," published an editorial on March 30th, welcoming the upcoming Asian-African Conference.

The editorial stated that the Asian-African Conference will become one of the most significant meetings in the history of Asian and African countries, which have long been subjected to exploitation and oppression by imperialism. The United States has shown blatant hostility towards the Asian-African Conference. This is because the success of this conference will further isolate the United States in this region.

The editorial stated that the majority of the Japanese people sincerely hope to coexist peacefully with all countries, implement economic cooperation, promote trade, and freely conduct cultural exchanges. This urgent desire of the Japanese people is consistent with the desire of the people of all countries to hold the Asian-African Conference and move forward hand in hand.

The editorial concluded by saying that we welcome the Japanese government representatives to attend this significant Asian-African Conference alongside the governments of Asian countries. The Japanese people hope that the Japanese government representatives can fulfill the aspirations of the Japanese nation.

    日本“赤旗报”发表社论欢迎亚非会议
    新华社八日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央机关报“赤旗报”三月三十日发表社论，欢迎即将举行的亚非会议。
    社论说，在长期处在帝国主义的榨取和压迫下的亚洲和非洲国家的历史中，亚非会议将成为具有最重大意义的会议之一。美国对亚非会议表现了露骨的敌意。这是因为这个会议获得成功，就将使美国在这一地区更加陷于孤立。
    社论说，大多数日本人民由衷地希望同一切国家和平共处，实行经济合作，促进贸易，自由进行文化交流。日本人民的这个迫切愿望和各国人民希望举行亚非会议携手前进的愿望是一致的。
    社论最后说，我们欢迎日本政府代表和亚洲各国政府并肩出席这个意义重大的亚非会议。日本人民希望日本政府代表能满足日本民族的愿望。
