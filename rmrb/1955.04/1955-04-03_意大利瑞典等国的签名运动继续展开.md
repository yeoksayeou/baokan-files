Xinhua News Agency: The signature campaign for the World Peace Council’s “Appeal to the People of the World” is vigorously unfolding in Italy. Mass rallies and gatherings have been held in many cities and villages.

At a meeting in Pisa, Communist Senator Ambrogio Donini spoke. Referring to the statements of politicians and “Atlantic” generals who openly advocate the use of atomic weapons in the event of a new war, he called on all Italians to resolutely fight against this sinister conspiracy.

Citizens of various social statuses and beliefs are increasingly signing the “Appeal to the People of the World.” In the province of Salerno, signatories to the “Appeal to the People of the World” include Judge Matusali, Amendola, a member of the National Monarchist Party, twenty primary school teachers, a deputy mayor of the Christian Democratic Party, and Damico, the secretary of the Vitelli local organization of the Catholic Action Party.

Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, 29th (TASS): The campaign in Sweden to collect signatures for the World Peace Council's “Appeal to the People of the World” is continuing to unfold.

According to "New Daily," the Lidköping Metalworkers' Union passed a resolution stating: We demand the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons and call on the Swedish government to use every opportunity in international affairs to ease the differences between the major powers.

Hilding Hagberg, Chairman of the Swedish Communist Party, spoke at a rally in Nynäshamn, saying: The Swedish government should strive for the prohibition of atomic weapons. Hagberg expressed satisfaction with the Swedish government's rejection of the demand that Sweden acquire atomic weapons. He pointed out: Obtaining atomic weapons can only pose a fatal threat to our country and will not strengthen defense. If the so-called demand that Sweden should purchase atomic weapons from foreign countries is agreed to, it would mean that our country would abandon its policy of neutrality and non-alignment, which is supported by the vast majority of the people.

    意大利瑞典等国的签名运动继续展开
    据新华社讯　为世界和平理事会“告全世界人民书”而发动的征集签名运动在意大利蓬勃展开。许多城市和乡村都举行了群众大会和集会。
    在彼萨举行的大会上，共产党参议员安布罗齐·多尼尼讲了话。他在谈到那些公开主张一旦新战争爆发时采用原子武器的政治家和“大西洋”将领的言论时，号召全体意大利人坚决反击这种罪恶的阴谋。
    各种社会地位和信仰不同的公民在“告全世界人民书”上签名的人越来越多。在萨勒诺省，在“告全世界人民书”上签名的有法官马图萨利，民族保皇党党员阿门多拉和二十个小学教师，一个天主教民主党的副市长、天主教行动党维特利地方组织书记达米科也在“告全世界人民书”上签了名。
    新华社讯　据塔斯社斯德哥尔摩二十九日讯：瑞典为世界和平理事会的告全世界人民书征集签名的运动正在继续展开。
    据“新日报”报道，利德柯平五金工人工会通过了一项决议，决议说：我们要求禁止原子武器和氢武器，要求瑞典政府利用国际事务中的一切机会来缓和大国间的分歧。
    瑞典共产党主席希尔丁·哈格堡在尼纳夏姆的一个集会上发言说：瑞典政府应该为禁止原子武器而努力。哈格堡对瑞典政府拒绝主张瑞典要获得原子武器的要求表示满意。他指出：得到原子武器只能形成对我们国家的致命的威胁，并不能加强防御。如果答应了所谓瑞典应该从外国购买原子武器的要求，这就意味着我国将放弃为绝大多数人民所拥护的中立和不参加联盟的政策。（附图片）
