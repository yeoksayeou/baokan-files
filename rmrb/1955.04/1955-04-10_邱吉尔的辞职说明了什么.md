Churchill, who served as Prime Minister of the British government for two terms during and after World War II, has resigned. Some people like to attribute Churchill's resignation to his age, which does not correspond to the essence of this event. Churchill's resignation is because he made many promises to the people, but in reality, he did not try to fulfill his promises. Instead, he followed the United States in everything, causing great damage to the interests of the British people, which aroused great dissatisfaction among the people and inside and outside Parliament. Therefore, he had no choice but to retreat behind the scenes and let someone else lead the Conservative Party and serve as the Prime Minister of Britain.

Churchill was able to defeat the British Labour Party and come to power in the 1951 general election only because he promised the British people to strive for peace. People remember that at that time, he advocated that the leaders of Western countries should "hold face-to-face talks" with the Soviet leaders to "build a bridge" between the two worlds, so that there would be "no hatred and Cold War conspiracy" between the two sides and that they could "live their own lives." However, from that time until now, Churchill has moved further and further away from his promises. In reality, what he has done is to follow the United States. Churchill said in the most recent foreign policy debate in the British House of Commons: "The most important thing in my mind is to enhance our friendship and understanding with our ally, the United States." However, in this alliance, Britain is not an equal partner of the United States. The Churchill government even had to give up Britain's sovereignty and security interests as the price of allying with the United States. The United States not only has troops stationed on British soil and owns air force bases, but according to Churchill, the United States also has the right to use these bases to launch atomic warfare without the consent of Britain. Churchill described Britain as a country that "mainly depends on their (American) protection." Churchill's proposal for a summit of heads of state to resolve international disputes has never been put into action. He recently admitted in the House of Commons that he had yielded to the United States and agreed with the United States' opposition to the summit. It can be seen that Churchill's dependence on and subservience to the United States has subjected Britain to a humiliation that is difficult for a great power to tolerate.

Due to following the United States, Britain has also embarked on a dangerous path of expanding its military and preparing for a new war. The Churchill government has spent a huge sum of 4.7 billion pounds on armaments in the past three years, which has worsened the British economic situation. Moreover, the Churchill government published a "White Paper" on the manufacture of hydrogen bombs in February this year, and Churchill openly clamored in the British House of Commons to implement a "deterrent" policy against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. Churchill has consistently supported the U.S. aggressive bloc's "policy of strength" in pursuit of world hegemony, helping the U.S. to establish and expand a system of military blocs around the world. Churchill has repeatedly publicly threatened France, forcing the French Parliament to approve the Paris Accords in order to revive German militarism, which has greatly deteriorated the situation in Europe. The Churchill government, disregarding the solemn obligations undertaken by Britain at the Geneva Conference, colluded with the United States to establish the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, and included South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia within the "protection" scope of this military bloc, so that the good results produced by the Geneva Conference are facing increasingly serious threats of destruction. Regarding the Taiwan situation, Churchill did not hesitate to betray the provisions of the Cairo Declaration, and tried to obliterate China's legitimate sovereignty over Taiwan, creating the so-called issue of Taiwan's undetermined status, trying to create "two Chinas," and supporting the United States' occupation of China's territory of Taiwan. It is because of this support from Britain that the United States dares to rampantly expand its aggressive actions to China's coastal islands, creating a serious danger of war in the Taiwan Strait. Recently, the British government directly participated in the Turkish-Iraqi pact, and helped the United States to pressure other Middle Eastern countries to participate in this treaty, which has also greatly heightened the tension in the Middle East situation.

Churchill's actions have caused direct harm to Britain itself. The policy of preparing for atomic warfare and reviving German militarism confronts Britain with two truly dangerous destructive forces: the most powerful enemy it has encountered in Europe—German militarism—and the atomic and hydrogen bombs that pose a fatal danger to the British Isles. In the Far East, it is in danger of being dragged into a war that is meaningless to Britain. In all parts of the world, Britain's position is being squeezed out by the United States, and even some British Dominions are increasingly being drawn into the embrace of the United States.

The British people oppose Churchill's policy of following the United States. The British people see very clearly that this can only cause disaster for Britain and make their own lives even more impoverished. They demand arms reduction, demand the prohibition of atomic weapons, oppose the rearmament of West Germany, advocate the convening of a summit of great powers, and demand to break away from the shackles of American war policy. This increasingly widespread voice of the British people has been reflected in the British Parliament. In recent years, the British House of Commons has debated the issue of a summit of great powers more than once and made relevant resolutions; the Paris Accords on the rearmament of West Germany received the support of only 42 percent of the members of the British House of Commons; and the "White Paper" announcing the manufacture of hydrogen bombs has been condemned and opposed both inside and outside Parliament. The Churchill government's policy of supporting the U.S. occupation of Taiwan has been severely criticized, especially within Parliament and among the broad masses of the people. It can be seen that it is very difficult for British rulers to continue to maintain the policy of following the United States.

Under the pressure of the British people, the British rulers also broke away from the influence of the United States in the 1954 Geneva Conference on the discussion of the issue of restoring peace in Indochina and adopted a policy that conformed to British interests, which is how the Geneva Accords were achieved. This was not only unanimously supported by the British people, but also increased Britain's prestige among the great powers of the world. This proves that if Britain frees itself from the shackles of the United States and truly adopts an independent policy that conforms to British interests, it can strengthen Britain's international position and ensure Britain's security and interests. The method of continuing to follow the United States will not benefit any British government.

    邱吉尔的辞职说明了什么
　　高集
    在第二次世界大战期间和战后曾担任了两届英国政府首相的邱吉尔辞职了。有些人喜欢把邱吉尔的辞职说成是年龄的原因，这是同这次事件的实质不能相符的。邱吉尔的辞职是因为他向人民许下许多诺言，而实际上他却不设法实现他的诺言，反而处处追随美国，使英国人民的利益受到极大的损害，引起了人民和议会内外极大的不满。因此，他就不能不被迫退到后面去，而由别人来率领保守党并担任英国的首相。
    邱吉尔在一九五一年的大选中能够击败英国工党而当政，只是因为他向英国人民许下了努力谋求和平的诺言。人们都记得：当时他曾主张西方国家的领袖同苏联领袖“举行面对面的会谈”，来在两个世界之间“建造一座桥梁”，使双方之间“没有仇恨和冷战阴谋”，而能“各得其所地生活下去”。但是，自那时直到现在，邱吉尔却离着他所许下的诺言越来越远。实际上他所做的却是追随美国。邱吉尔在最近一次英国下院的外交辩论中就说：“我心目中最重要的一件事就是：增进我们同我们的盟国美国的友谊和谅解。”但是，在这个联盟中，英国并不是美国的平等的伙伴。邱吉尔政府甚至必须以放弃英国的主权和安全利益，来作为和美国结盟的代价。美国不但在英国本土驻有军队和拥有空军基地，而且据邱吉尔说，美国还有权不得到英国的同意而使用这些基地发动原子战争。邱吉尔把英国说成是“主要依赖他们（美国）的保护”的国家。邱吉尔关于举行大国首脑会议来解决国际争端的主张，一直不能付诸行动。他最近在下院竟然承认，他向美国让了步，同意了美国反对大国会议的意见。由此可见，由于邱吉尔对美国的依赖和屈从，已使英国遭受了一个大国所难以容忍的屈辱。
    由于追随美国，也使英国走上了扩张军备和准备新战争的危险道路。邱吉尔政府在过去三年中已在军备上花费了四十七亿英镑的巨额开支，这使得英国经济情况恶化。并且，邱吉尔政府在今年二月发表了制造氢弹的“白皮书”，邱吉尔在英国下院中公然叫嚷要对苏联和人民民主国家实行“威慑”政策。邱吉尔一贯地支持美国侵略集团追求世界霸权的“实力政策”，帮助美国在世界各地建立和扩大军事集团体系。邱吉尔曾一再公开出面恫吓法国，逼使法国议会批准巴黎协定，来复活德国军国主义，使欧洲的局势大大恶化。邱吉尔政府并不顾英国在日内瓦会议中所担承的庄严义务，协同美国建立了东南亚侵略集团，把南越、老挝、柬埔寨列入了这个军事集团的“保护”范围之内，以致日内瓦会议所产生的良好结果正在遭到日益严重的破坏威胁。对于台湾局势，邱吉尔不惜背弃开罗宣言的规定，力图抹杀中国对台湾的合法主权，制造所谓台湾地位未定的问题，想搞“两个中国”，支持美国侵占中国的领土台湾。由于英国的这种支持，才使得美国敢于猖狂地要把它的侵略行动扩大到中国的沿海岛屿，造成了台湾海峡的严重的战争危险。最近，英国政府直接参加了土伊条约，并帮助美国压迫其他中东国家参加这个条约，使中东局势也大大紧张起来。
    邱吉尔的这些做法，使英国自己首先受到直接的危害。准备原子战争和复活德国军国主义的政策，使英国面临着两个真正危险的破坏力量：它在欧洲所碰到过的最强大的敌人——德国军国主义和对英伦三岛是致命危险的原子弹和氢弹。在远东它有被拖入一场对英国毫无意义的战争的危险。在世界各处，英国的地位正在受到美国的排挤，甚至一些英国的自治领也被日益拉入美国的怀抱。
    英国人民反对邱吉尔这种追随美国的政策。英国人民看得很清楚，这只能给英国造成灾难。使他们自己的生活更加陷于贫困。他们要求裁减军备，要求禁止原子武器，反对重新武装西德，主张召开大国会议，要求摆脱美国战争政策的束缚。英国人民这种日益广泛的呼声，已经在英国的议会中反映出来。几年来，英国下院不止一次辩论过大国会议的问题，并作出了有关的决议；重新武装西德的巴黎协定在英国下院中只得到百分之四十二的议员的支持；宣布制造氢弹的“白皮书”在议会内外都遭到了谴责和反对。邱吉尔政府支持美国侵占台湾的政策尤其是在议会内外和广大人民中受到严厉的斥责。由此可见，英国当政者要继续维持追随美国的政策是十分困难了。
    在英国人民的压力下，英国当政者也曾在一九五四年的日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平问题的讨论中摆脱了美国的影响，采取了符合英国利益的政策，这样才取得了日内瓦协议。这不但受到了英国人民的一致支持，并且曾使英国在世界的大国中增加了声望。这就证明，如果英国从美国的束缚中解脱出来，真正采取合乎英国利益的独立的政策，就能加强英国的国际地位，并使英国的安全和利益得到保障。而继续跟美国走下去的办法，对任何英国政府都是不会有什么好处的。
