Solving the Problem of Valuing Draft Cattle
—An Experience from the 19th Agricultural Cooperative in Wangcheng Township, Xishui County
    Gao Changren
    The rapeseed is already blooming, and the wheat seedlings are growing lushly green. Rice seedlings are about to be transplanted, and cattle will be needed. However, in the 19th Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wangcheng Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province, the cattle issue remained unresolved.
    This cooperative was established last November, with twenty-two member households and eight draft cattle. On January 30th of this year, cooperative cadres took these eight cattle to the cattle market for valuation. In principle, the price should have been fair. However, the cattle market was crowded with draft cattle awaiting evaluation, and the evaluators were overwhelmed. They merely glanced at the cattle's height, size, fatness, and leanness, and then gave a price. As a result, five of the strong cattle were undervalued by three to five yuan each. Because the price of these five cattle was too low, the owners were unwilling to hand them over to the cooperative for use.
    The owners of these five cattle included two middle-peasant households and three poor-peasant households. Among them, the middle peasant Zhu Guoxing was the vice-chairman of the cooperative, and the poor peasants Wei Guanggan and Zhu Xinghe were the deputy leaders of the production team. Dissatisfied with the low valuation of the draft cattle, they gently said to the cooperative chairman: The cattle prices are a bit low, and the members are not satisfied. Should this problem be resolved?
    The cooperative chairman Wei Guangjin and vice-chairman Zhai Zhongying (both Party members) also knew that the valuation of the draft cattle was somewhat low. But what could they do? They had considered adjusting the prices of those that were too low. However, they also thought that adjusting all the prices would increase the burden on the cooperative, and the members without cattle would also object. They felt that this approach was not feasible, so they adopted the so-called method of "ideological clarification" to deal with the problem.
    They started by clarifying the cadres' thinking. At the cooperative affairs committee meeting, Wei Guangjin criticized Wei Guanggan and Zhu Xinghe for showing selfish tendencies by complaining about the low valuation of the draft cattle. He said that they lacked a sense of collectivism, and how could they lead the masses in building socialism like this? This big label worked. Sure enough, the cadres with cattle no longer raised objections in person; however, they were still dissatisfied behind the scenes, and their work enthusiasm was also low. Later, whenever the issue of draft cattle valuation was mentioned at the cooperative affairs committee meetings, vice-chairman Zhu Guoxing would remain silent, and Wei Guanggan and Zhu Xinghe would also blush and slump over the table, as if they couldn't lift their heads.
    Seeing that "ideological clarification" was very "effective," Wei Guangjin and Zhai Zhongying also applied it at the members' general meetings. Every three to five days, they would criticize the thinking of the households with cattle who were dissatisfied with the cattle prices. The content of each criticism was inseparable from these points: "If you want to take the socialist road, how can you do it with such selfishness?" "Do you want to farm the land yourselves?" However, the thinking of the member households with cattle was not as easy to "clarify" as that of the cooperative cadres. They questioned the cooperative chairman:
    "Would it be okay if I sold my cattle and invested the money into the cooperative instead?"
    "Can I join the cooperative with my labor and land, but not with my cattle, and use my cattle to cultivate my own land?"
    "I'll let the cooperative use my cattle for free, as long as the cooperative returns my original cattle to me in the future."
    In this way, from January 30th to March 18th, the problem of draft cattle valuation remained unresolved.
    On the night of March 18th, after Wei Guangjin and Zhai Zhongying finished attending a meeting at the township Party branch, they happily planned how to solve the problem of draft cattle valuation within the cooperative. This knot that had long troubled them had been resolved at the branch meeting.
    The branch criticized their past practices as violating the policy of voluntary participation and mutual benefit. The branch told them that the draft cattle should be entered into the cooperative at market prices, so that the households with cattle would not suffer losses.
    At the cooperative affairs committee meeting the next day, Wei Guangjin proposed the issue of re-evaluating the draft cattle reasonably and asked everyone to discuss it. Committee member Zhan Shiyou (a poor peasant) raised a different opinion. His reasoning was the same as what Wei Guangjin had thought in the past, believing that re-evaluating at market prices would increase the burden on the cooperative.
    Wei Guangjin calculated the accounts with him: Only five of the cooperative's draft cattle were undervalued, some by three yuan and some by five yuan, totaling only twenty-two yuan. The cooperative had twenty-two households, each of which would bear an extra yuan. In this way, the price would be reasonable, the member households with cattle would be satisfied, everyone's enthusiasm for production would be high, and the policy of voluntary participation and mutual benefit would be implemented. He asked Zhan Shiyou: "If we don't re-evaluate the prices reasonably, how much impact will this have on production if we drag on like this? Doesn't making the households with cattle suffer losses count as undermining mutual benefit?"
    Zhan Shiyou had no more objections. The opinions of the cooperative affairs committee were unified.
    Vice-chairman Zhu Guoxing, who had previously been dissatisfied with the unfair valuation of the draft cattle, also spoke this time. He said that his cattle were undervalued by five yuan when they entered the cooperative, and he was not satisfied. However, he was afraid that people would say that he, as a cadre, was being selfish if he raised the issue, but he was clearly going to suffer a loss if he didn't speak up. Now, he agreed to adjust the undervalued cattle prices this time.
    At the members' general meeting on March 22nd, all the members approved compensating the households with cattle for the five cattle that had been undervalued, based on market prices. The meeting also determined the specific methods for draft cattle to enter the cooperative and resolved the feeding issues.
    The smooth resolution of this problem made the cooperative cadres and members very happy. The member households with cattle were very satisfied. After Zhu Guoxing received the five yuan for the cattle price, he became much more proactive in his work. One day, he even braved the heavy rain to go to the city to find sideline business opportunities for the cooperative. Before this problem was resolved, other work within the cooperative was difficult to promote. The cooperative affairs committee wanted to invite a blacksmith to repair farm tools, but the members raised a lot of difficulties, such as not having money to buy iron, or not having rice or vegetables to provide for the blacksmith's meals. After the problem of draft cattle valuation was resolved, Zhu Guoxing put forward a rationalization proposal to collect the scrap iron from the members' homes and sell it to the cooperative at a price, saving the cooperative's funds. At this time, the members also unanimously said that each family would buy two pieces of tofu, which would solve the blacksmith's meal problem. On the 24th, the cooperative invited a blacksmith to repair farm tools. On this day, Wei Guanggan brought a piece of iron brick from his home to the cooperative, and Zhu Xinghe also brought out more than ten kilograms of iron. Zhan Chengqing, who had previously demanded that his draft cattle not enter the cooperative, was satisfied because he was compensated for his three yuan cattle price, and said, "In this case, my cattle will still join the cooperative." Zhu Xinghe, who had previously required the cooperative cadres to push him before he would work, took the initiative to shovel sod to block the leaking water pipe in the pond the day after the draft cattle issue was resolved. On March 23rd, after a long period of rain, the sky cleared up, and all the members went to dig sod to accumulate fertilizer with great enthusiasm. Usually, each person only earned eight work points per day, but on this day, they all earned ten to twelve work points.
    After this lesson, Wei Guangjin also realized the mistakes of his past practices. He said that he had only wanted to improve the cooperative quickly before, but he had forgotten the policy of voluntary participation and mutual benefit. This time, by implementing the policy, not only were the members satisfied, but the cadres also put down a burden on their shoulders and untied a knot in their hearts.

    解决耕牛作价问题
    ——浠水县望城乡第十九农业合作社的一个经验
    高长任
    油菜已经开花，麦苗长的碧绿，眼看就要下秧播种，要用到牛了。可是，在湖北省浠水县望城乡第十九农业生产合作社里，牛还没有着落。
    这个社是在去年十一月成立的，二十二户社员，有八头耕牛。今年一月三十日，由社干部把这八头牛牵到牛集上去作价，照理，价格是应该公平的；可是，那时牛集上挤满了等待评价的耕牛，评牛价的人忙得昏头昏脑，只是表面上看看牛的高、大、肥、瘦，就说了个价钱，八头牛，有五头壮牛每头被少评了三元到五元。这五头牛的价钱评低了，牛主就不愿把牛交给社里使用。
    这五头牛的主人有两户是中农，三户是贫农。其中中农朱国兴是副社长，贫农韦光干和朱兴和是生产队的副队长。他们对耕牛作价低了不满意，就婉转地对社长说：牛价低了些，社员不满意，要不要把这个问题解决一下？
    社长韦光金和副社长翟仲英（都是党员）也知道耕牛作价有些低了。可是，怎么办呢？他们曾想到，个别太低的可以调整。但是他们又想要全部调整，就会加重社里的负担，没牛户的社员也会有意见。他们觉得这个办法不行，就采用了所谓“打通思想”的办法来处理这个问题。
    他们先打通干部的思想。在社务委员会上，韦光金批评韦光干和朱兴和嫌耕牛作价低是自私自利思想作怪，是没有集体观念，这样怎么领导群众建设社会主义？这个大帽子一扣，果然，有牛的社干部当面不提意见了；可是他们背后还是不满意，工作情绪也很低落。以后在社务委员会上一提起耕牛作价问题，副社长朱国兴就不作声，韦光干和朱兴和也是满脸通红，朝桌子上一伏，好像抬不起头来似的。
    韦光金和翟仲英看到“打通思想”很有“效”，在社员大会上也就应用起来了。每隔三天五天，就在大会上把有牛户对牛价不满的思想批评一顿。每次批评的内容也离不开这些：“你们要走社会主义道路，照这样自私自利怎么行？”“你自己要不要耕田。”但是，有牛户社员的思想，不像社干部那样好“打通”，他们反问社长：
    “我把牛卖了，另外投资入社好不好？”
    “我人和田入社，牛不入社，用我的牛耕我自己的田行不行？”
    “我的牛给社里白用，只要社里以后还我原牛。”
    就这样从一月三十日，一直拖到三月十八日，耕牛作价问题还是没解决。
    三月十八日的夜晚，韦光金和翟仲英在乡支部开完会后，怀着愉快的心情在计划如何解决社内的耕牛作价问题。这个他们长久苦恼的解不开的疙瘩，在支部会上得到解决了。
    支部批评他们过去的做法违反自愿互利政策。支部告诉他们：应该把耕牛照市价入社，不叫有牛户吃亏。
    第二天开社务委员会时，韦光金提出了把耕牛重新合理作价的问题请大家研究。社委詹世友（贫农）提出不同的意见，他的理由和韦光金过去想的一样，认为重新按市价作价要增加社里的负担。
    韦光金和他算了一下账：社里的耕牛只有五头作价低了些，有的低三元，有的低五元，加起来只二十二元。全社有二十二户，每户多负担一元。这样，价格合理，有牛户的社员满意，大家生产情绪都高，也执行了自愿互利政策。他问詹世友：“你想，要是不重新合理作价，像这样拖下去，对生产的影响有多大？叫有牛户吃亏，算不算互利？”
    詹世友没意见了。社务委员会的意见统一了。
    过去不满意耕牛作价不公的副社长朱国兴，这次也发了言。他说，他的牛入社少评了五元，自己不满意；可是，要提出来吧，怕人说他是个干部还自私自利，不说吧，自己又明摆着要吃亏。现在，他同意把评低了的牛价来一次调整。
    在三月二十二日的社员大会上，全体社员通过把原来作价低的五头牛，按市价补给有牛户，会上还确定了耕牛入社的具体办法，解决了喂养的问题。
    这个问题的顺利解决，社的干部和社员都很高兴。有牛户的社员很满意。朱国兴补进了五元的牛价后，工作主动多了，有一天，还冒着大雨到城里去替社里找副业门路。在没有解决这个问题的时候，社内其他工作都不好推动。社务委员会想请个铁匠来修补农具，社员们就提出一大堆困难，没有钱买铁呀，没有米、没有菜供铁匠的饭呀。解决耕牛作价问题以后，朱国兴就提出一个合理化建议，把社员家里的废铁集中起来，作价给社里，节省社内的资金。社员们这时也一致说一家买两块豆腐，就解决了铁匠的吃饭问题。二十四日，社里就请了铁匠来修补农具。这一天，韦光干把家里一块铁砖送到社里来，朱兴和也拿出了十几斤铁。过去要求耕牛不入社的詹成青，因为补足了他三元的牛价，也满意地说：“这样，我的牛还是入社。”过去要社干部推动才肯干活的朱兴和，在耕牛问题解决后的第二天，就主动去铲草皮挡住塘里的漏水管。三月二十三日久雨初晴，全体社员都精神抖擞地去挖草皮积肥；平常，每人每天只做到八个工分，这一天，都做到十工分到十二工分。
    经过这次教训，韦光金也认识到自己过去做法的错误，他说：他以前光想快点把社办好，却忘了自愿互利政策。这回贯彻了政策，不但社员满意，干部的肩上也放下了一个包袱，心里也解开了一个疙瘩。
