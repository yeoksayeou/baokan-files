The office building jointly constructed by the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the First Machine Building Ministry, and the Second Machine Building Ministry is a large-scale building complex in Beijing. The first phase of the project includes one main building and two auxiliary buildings, totaling 90,000 square meters. The auxiliary buildings have eight floors including the roof, and the main building has ten floors including the roof. The ridge of the main building is 46 meters above the ground, making it the tallest brick and stone structure in Beijing. Currently, the two auxiliary buildings, totaling approximately 60,000 square meters, have been completed, and construction on the main building is underway.

From the perspective of work needs, the construction of this group of buildings is necessary. Currently, many ministries and bureaus in Beijing have small offices and have to be scattered in various locations, some of which are more than ten miles apart. This situation hinders work to a certain extent. However, while considering the needs, the construction unit and the architects did not pay sufficient attention to economic issues in the construction.

The waste in these two buildings is primarily manifested in the pursuit of architectural form. To pursue the outline of the buildings, six useless double-eaved roofs were added to the two auxiliary buildings, costing 320,000 yuan in labor and materials. This does not include the waste caused by increasing the structure to support the heavy roofs. Due to the emphasis on the "characteristics" of national architecture, many fake components such as Dougong (斗拱) and Efang (额枋) were made of cement under the heavy eaves. Glazed tiles were also inlaid on the "parapet walls," and even the boiler room was edged with glazed tiles. To achieve superficial decoration, a batch of valuable materials were used, such as artificial marble and white cement in some places, the prices of which were several times to ten times higher than ordinary materials. There were also painted ceilings and large palace lanterns. The emphasis on decoration complicated the construction project. The cost of making model samples alone amounted to 9,700 yuan; some floral decorations were made more than ten times. When building the large roofs, the completion date of the entire project was postponed by 45 working days due to operational difficulties, affecting the ability of the users to utilize the building complex sooner.

There were also many instances of rework waste during the design process. According to statistics from the construction unit, design changes due to inadequate design reached 245 times, totaling over 1,000 instances. Taking the change in the design of the plumbing and heating project as an example, it prevented the normal construction of the project, resulting in a loss of 32,000 yuan in labor and material costs. For example, the design of the floor did not include air vents, and the "keel" was too small, resulting in cracks in more than 1,400 square meters of flooring, which had to be reworked, wasting a lot of wood and labor.

There was also a lot of waste during construction. In 1954 alone, there were a total of more than 570 recorded quality accidents, both large and small. Among them, unclear drawings and errors in construction techniques caused the concrete floor slabs to exceed the original design by one to two points, wasting 4,200 bags of cement. Because the formulation of work plans was inaccurate and the construction was unbalanced during the construction process, many instances of idle work occurred. From March to December of last year, due to unbalanced construction, skilled workers were used for rough work, wasting more than 54,000 skilled workers.

This means that if the construction unit, architects, and construction unit could pay enough attention to saving and avoid the above-mentioned waste, at least 500,000 to 600,000 yuan of funds could be saved for the state. Calculated at 80 yuan per square meter, 6,000 to 7,000 square meters of dormitories could be built.

The formation of these wasteful phenomena is also due to the construction unit's failure to conduct specific inspections in the design and construction, the construction unit's failure to think of more ways to reduce project costs during construction, and especially the formalism architectural thinking of the designers. Although economic issues were considered during the design process, the pursuit of the outline of the buildings led to the imitation of the style of the towers on the ancient city walls of Beijing, adding several ancient roofs to this group of modern buildings! Although the motive was for aesthetics, it actually wasted money and was not beautiful, making this group of buildings look like an ancient castle.

Of course, it should also be mentioned that the architects who designed this building complex made some valuable efforts in the design. For example, the original planned reinforced concrete frame structure was changed to a brick and stone structure, saving steel and cement; the facade was treated relatively simply, without cumbersome decoration; the building density was appropriately controlled, and the depth of the buildings was increased, saving land area and outdoor ancillary project costs, etc., thus reducing the cost of this building to about 140 yuan per square meter. The construction unit also implemented piece-rate wages and carried out labor competitions during construction, thereby improving labor productivity. Unfortunately, they stopped there and did not think about how to further save money and reduce the project cost to the minimum.

Recently, the Housing Construction Committee, composed of the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the First Machine Building Ministry, and the Second Machine Building Ministry, sent people to conduct a more thorough inspection of this building. In the spirit of thrift, they revised the design of the main building that is under construction, canceled the large roof of the main building, reduced unnecessary interior decoration, and replaced certain valuable materials with ordinary materials, resulting in a cost reduction of 200,000 yuan. This practice is correct and timely.

    从节约观点看“四部一会”的办公大楼
    重达
    国家计划委员会和地质部、重工业部、第一机械工业部、第二机械工业部联合修建的办公大楼，是北京市一个规模很大的建筑群。第一期工程包括主楼一座、副楼两座，共九万平方公尺。副楼连屋顶共八层，主楼连屋顶是十层。主楼屋脊离地面四十六公尺，是北京市砖石结构建筑中最高的一个。现在，约六万平方公尺的两座副楼已竣工，主楼工程正在建筑中。
    从工作需要看，建造这群建筑是必要的。因为目前北京有不少的部、局，办公室小，不得不分散在各处办公，有的相距十几里，这种情形在一定程度上妨碍了工作。但是，建筑单位和建筑师在考虑需要的同时，却没有充分注意建筑中的经济问题。
    这两幢楼的浪费，首先表现在追求建筑形式方面。为追求房屋的轮廓线，在两幢副楼上加了六个毫无用处的重檐屋顶耗费工料费三十二万元，而这还不包括因屋顶太重而引起加大结构方面的浪费。由于强调民族建筑的“特点”，在重檐下面，用水泥做了许多虚假的构件，如斗拱、额枋等。“女儿墙”上也镶上琉璃瓦，甚至连锅炉房也用琉璃瓦镶边。为了表面的装饰，采用了一批贵重的材料，有些地方用人造大理石和白水泥，这些材料的价格比普通材料贵数倍到十倍。另外还有彩画顶棚和大宫灯。由于强调装饰，就使建筑工程复杂了。仅模型试样一项费用，就花了九千七百元；有些花饰做了十几次样子。建造大屋顶时，因为操作困难，把全部工程竣工日期向后拖了四十五个工作日，影响到使用单位不能早日利用这群建筑。
    在设计过程中返工浪费的现象也不少。根据施工单位的统计，由于设计不周而改动设计的达二百四十五次、一千余处。以改变水暖工程设计为例，曾使这一工程不能正常施工，损失工料费达三万二千多元。又如设计地板时没有空气洞，又兼“龙骨”较小，致使一千四百多平方公尺的地板裂缝，不得不返工重做，损失许多木料和人工。
    施工当中同样有不少浪费。在一九五四年一年中，发生的有记录的大小质量事故共五百七十多次。其中因图纸交代不清、施工技术方面发生错误，使混凝土楼板超过原设计一至二分，浪费了四千二百袋水泥。因为在施工过程中制定作业计划不准确、施工不均衡，曾发生不少窝工现象。去年三月份至十二月份，因施工不均衡，用技工干粗工活，浪费了技工五万四千多个。
    这就是说，如果建筑单位、建筑师、施工单位能够十分重视节约，避免上述的浪费，至少可为国家节省五十万至六十万元的资金，按八十元一平方公尺计算，可多盖六千到七千平方公尺宿舍。
    这些浪费现象之所以形成，还由于建筑单位未能在设计和施工中进行具体检查、施工单位未能在施工中想更多的办法降低工程成本，特别是由于设计人员的形式主义建筑思想作祟，设计过程中，虽曾考虑过经济问题，但由于追求建筑的轮廓线，便摹仿北京古老城墙上城楼的式样，把几个古老的屋顶加在这群近代建筑的上面了！其动机虽然是为了美观，实际上不但浪费了钱，而且不美，使这群建筑像一个古代的城堡。
    当然，也应该提到的，是设计这座建筑群的建筑师，在设计中曾作了一些可贵的努力。比如把原计划的钢筋混凝土骨架结构改为砖石结构，节省了钢材和水泥；立面处理得比较简单，没有繁琐装饰；适当控制建筑密度、加大了房屋的深度，节省了用地面积和室外附属工程费用等等，因此使这个建筑的造价降到每平方公尺一百四十元左右。施工单位在施工中，也实行了计件工资、开展了劳动竞赛，因而提高了劳动生产率。可惜的是他们到此为止了，没有想到如何进一步的节约，把工程造价降低到最低限度。
    最近，由国家计划委员会、地质部、重工业部、第一机械工业部、第二机械工业部组成的建房委员会派人对这个建筑进行一次较彻底的检查，本着节约的精神修改了正在施工的主楼的设计，取消了主楼的大屋顶、减掉了室内的不必要的装饰、用普通材料代替某些贵重材料，结果降低造价二十万元。这种做法是正确的、及时的。
