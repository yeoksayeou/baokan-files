    Don't Discriminate Against Farmers Outside the Cooperative
    Ji Xichen
    In the agricultural cooperation movement, the Party has repeatedly taught us that we should adopt an attitude of warm care and active assistance towards mutual aid teams and individual farmers who have not yet joined agricultural cooperatives. Only in this way can we unite them to jointly develop agricultural production and gradually guide them onto the road of agricultural cooperation. In many areas of Sichuan, agricultural production and mutual cooperation organizations have developed because they have treated farmers outside the cooperative with enthusiasm and helped them improve production. However, in some areas, there is often intentional or unintentional discrimination and exclusion of farmers outside the cooperative. For example, such things happened in Zunsheng Township, a key township led by the CPC Santai County Committee.
    The planned arrangement of production for farmers inside and outside the cooperative is decisive for ensuring the comprehensive completion of agricultural production increase plans. However, the county committee work team stationed in Zunsheng Township lacked this overall perspective. They often only cared about those inside the cooperative and not those outside, neglecting the leadership of the production of the vast number of farmers outside the cooperative. They often disregarded the actual situation and concentrated most of the national loans, relief funds, and means of production used to solve the production and living difficulties of farmers to agricultural production cooperatives, while rarely inquiring about the production and difficulties of mutual aid teams and individual farmers. Sometimes they also drew a line of "three grades and nine levels" between farmers inside and outside the cooperative. No matter what, those inside the cooperative got more, those outside got less, older cooperatives got more, newer cooperatives got less, and mutual aid teams and individual households got very little or nothing at all. During the spring plowing preparations, mutual aid teams and individual farmers, who accounted for 58% of the township's agricultural population, received only 8.8% of the total national loans. The supply and marketing cooperative once supplied 40,000 jin of bone fertilizer to the township, but farmers outside the cooperative who lacked fertilizer did not receive any. Yongqian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yicun used its large loans as capital for speculation and exploitation, using the method of "buying green," buying sweet potato seedlings (fodder and green manure crops) from fourteen farmers outside the cooperative at a low price. For every thousand jin of sweet potato seedlings bought, farmers outside the cooperative had to add 100 jin of sweet potato seedlings as interest. Members of the mutual aid team said, "We can't get loans, but the cooperative uses the loans to exploit people." Similarly, because 70% of the relief funds were allocated to agricultural production cooperatives, the result was that farmers who were equally poor received different amounts of relief, with members of the cooperative receiving more and non-members receiving less. Those inside the cooperative who should not have received relief received it, while those outside the cooperative who should have received relief did not receive it. These unreasonable practices seriously damaged the production enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers outside the cooperative, causing great dissatisfaction among them.
    Everyone knows that implementing the policy of voluntarism and mutual benefit, and strengthening the Party's political work are the main keys to consolidating agricultural production cooperatives. However, the county committee work team stationed in Zunsheng Township relaxed the political and ideological education of its members, regarding simple economic assistance and excessive "preferential treatment" and "care" as important methods for consolidating agricultural production cooperatives, which led some agricultural production cooperative members to develop a "privilege" mentality of seeking advantages and showing off. They did not demonstrate the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives in all aspects to the farmers, and sometimes even infringed on the interests of farmers outside the cooperative. For example, Shuangheyan Agricultural Production Cooperative beat to death the chickens of farmers outside the cooperative in order to protect the crops inside the cooperative. During the drought resistance, they also forcibly occupied public ponds and weirs, not allowing others to use water. When the Lai Qizhen mutual aid team drew water from the pond, they took the water away from the mutual aid team's fields and even accused the mutual aid team of "sabotaging" production. The Dujiang Agricultural Production Cooperative damaged the crops of farmers outside the cooperative while pulling grass to make fertilizer. When others raised objections, they retorted, "We have the task of increasing production, you have no reason not to increase production!" The Yicun Licheng No. 2 Cooperative used all the fertilizer accumulated jointly with the mutual aid team for the cooperative. When the mutual aid team raised objections, the members of the cooperative all quarreled with them. The members of the mutual aid team had to say, "You have more people and power, we can't afford to offend you, forget it." This phenomenon also occurred in other villages, seriously affecting the unity between farmers inside and outside the cooperative and isolating the agricultural cooperative.
    Now, the work team of the CPC Santai County Committee has begun to correct some unreasonable practices, which is correct. However, in the future, it is necessary to establish a comprehensive view of leading agricultural production, strengthen the Party's political work in rectifying and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives, improve the socialist consciousness of its members, and improve relations with farmers outside the cooperative; at the same time, improve the mutual aid and cooperation network, and through the mutual aid and cooperation committee, earnestly help mutual aid teams and individual farmers overcome production difficulties and jointly develop production.

    不应歧视社外农民
    纪希晨
    在农业合作化运动中，党一再教导我们，对于尚未加入农业合作社的互助组和个体农民，应该采取热情关怀和积极帮助的态度，只有这样，才能团结他们共同发展农业生产，并逐步引导他们走上农业合作化的道路。四川许多地区由于热诚对待社外农民，帮助社外农民搞好生产，农业生产和互助合作组织都有了发展。但是有些地区往往有意或无意地对社外农民采取歧视和排斥的态度，例如在中共三台县委领导的重点乡——尊胜乡就曾发生过这样的事情。
    有计划地安排社内、社外农民的生产，对于保证全面完成农业增产计划具有决定性的作用。但驻尊胜乡的县委工作组，却缺乏这种全面观点，他们常常只管社内，不管社外，忽视了对广大社外农民生产的领导。他们往往不看实际情况，把国家用来解决农民生产、生活困难的大部分贷款、救济款和生产资料，都集中地贷放给农业生产合作社，而对于互助组和个体农民的生产和困难，却很少过问。有时他们还在社内、社外农民之间划出“三等九级”的界限，无论什么都是社内多，社外少，老社多，新社少，互助组和单干户不是很少就是没有。准备春耕中，占全乡农业人口中百分之五十八的互助组和个体农民，仅得到总数百分之八点八的国家贷款；供销合作社曾供应全乡四万斤骨肥，缺乏肥料的社外农民一点也没有得到。一村勇前农业生产合作社由于贷款多，便把贷款拿来作投机剥削的资本，采用“买青”办法，贱价买了社外十四户农民的苕苗（饲料和绿肥作物），每买千斤苕苗要社外农民外加一百斤苕苗的利息。互助组组员说：“我们贷款贷不到，合作社反把贷款拿来剥削人。”同样由于百分之七十的救济款都分配给了农业生产合作社，结果，同是一样贫苦的农民，社员得的多，非社员得的少，社内不应该救济的救济了，社外应该救济的却反而得不到救济。这些不合理的做法，严重地损害了社外广大农民的生产积极性，引起了社外农民极大不满。
    谁都知道，贯彻自愿两利政策，加强党的政治工作是巩固农业生产合作社的主要关键。可是驻尊胜乡县委工作组却放松了对社员的政治思想教育工作，把单纯的经济上的援助，以及过分的“优待”和“照顾”，当作巩固农业生产合作社的重要方法，致使某些农业生产合作社社员产生了讨便宜和逞强的“特权”思想。他们不是以农业生产合作社各方面的优越性来向农民示范，有时竟侵犯社外农民利益。例如双河堰农业生产合作社为了保护社内庄稼，打死了社外农民的鸡。在抗旱中他们还强霸公用的塘堰，不准别人用水。赖奇珍互助组在塘堰里挑了水，他们把水从互助组田中挑走，还给互助组扣上了“破坏”生产的帽子。渡江农业生产合作社扯草呕肥，损坏了社外农民的庄稼，当别人提出意见时，他们反说：“我们有增产任务，你们不增产没来头！”一村里程二社把同互助组共同积的肥料，全部用在社内了，互助组提出意见，社员就一齐同他们吵架，互助组组员只好说：“你们人多势众，我们惹不起，算了。”这种现象，其他村庄也都有发生，严重地影响了社内和社外农民之间的团结，并使农业社陷于孤立。
    现在，中共三台县委工作组已开始纠正了某些不合理的做法，这是对的。但今后必须树立全面领导农业生产的观点，在整顿和巩固农业生产合作社中，加强党的政治工作，提高社员的社会主义觉悟，搞好同社外农民的关系；同时健全互助合作网，通过互助合作委员会，认真帮助互助组和个体农民克服生产困难，共同发展生产。
