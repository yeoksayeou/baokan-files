    Why Hankou Leather Shoes Don't Sell Well
    Zhang Wei

    Hankou leather enjoys a high reputation throughout the country. Hankou can also manufacture leather shoes. However, until recently, the leather had to be transported to Shanghai to make the popular leather shoes. A large portion of the leather shoes sold in Beijing and Tianjin are manufactured in Shanghai. Some people living in Hankou have to go to Beijing to buy a pair of satisfactory Shanghai-made leather shoes made of "Hankou leather."

    It is said that Hankou leather shoes were originally sold well throughout the country. In the early days of liberation, more than forty units in the Northeast, Northwest, and North China regions placed orders with Hankou. However, in the past two or three years, the former China Department Store Central South District Company, China Department Store Wuhan Purchasing and Supplying Station, and China Department Store Wuhan City Company have developed complacency and conservatism. They believed that Hankou leather shoes sold well and received many orders, so they paid little attention to the quality and style of the shoes. When they entrusted processing, they only required that each piece of leather be used to make a few pairs of shoes, without considering whether consumers would like them. The leather shoe production department also blindly pursued quantity and produced shoddy goods. Originally, the shoe line should be treated with rosin wax, but sometimes it was not done in order to speed up production. As a result, some new leather shoes would break their lines and leak water as soon as they were worn. Sometimes, the processing department would even fail to distinguish the quality of the leather and use bad materials for the shoe uppers. People would wear them for a short time, and the uppers would wrinkle, break, fade, or become deformed; some leather shoe straps would break before they were even worn. A type of yellow, large-tongue Hercules flat-heeled leather shoe was difficult to put on because the back of the shoe was too low. There was also a type of rubber-soled women's leather shoe with a low heel and a wide instep, which would slip off when worn, like wearing slippers.

    The style of Hankou leather shoes was also very unpopular with customers. The cap toe of some men's leather shoes was large, square, and deep, and people called it the "coffin toe." There were even fewer styles of women's leather shoes. People said, "Hankou leather shoes are still the old style from 1933." Some old leather shoe workers said:
  "Some of the Hankou leather shoes are still the same as when I was an apprentice."

    Because the quality of Hankou-made leather shoes was poor and the style was outdated, the leather shoes processed by the China Department Store Wuhan Purchasing and Supplying Station began to be overstocked from 1949 onwards. At the National Department Store Supply Conference in 1954, no one paid attention to Hankou leather shoes. By December of last year, the Wuhan Purchasing and Supplying Station handed over more than 30,000 pairs of overstocked leather shoes to the Wuhan Native Products Company Trust Department for promotion. During the Wuhan State-owned Commercial System Potential Goods Exchange Conference held in December of last year, the Trust Department had not yet sold the leather shoes, and mobilized twenty or thirty cadres and their family members to go to various factories and enterprises to sell them on credit and at reduced prices. After two months, more than 10,000 pairs were sold; more than 10,000 pairs were still in stock, and many have now become moldy, broken, faded, wrinkled, and deformed, and some even have broken leather and fallen heels.

    At the recent exhibition held in Wuhan to improve product quality and diversify varieties, the state-owned commercial departments exposed the above-mentioned shortcomings and began to change the past processing method that only focused on quantity and not quality. The Wuhan Purchasing and Supplying Station also sent people to Shanghai, Beijing and other places to collect dozens of leather shoe samples that Wuhan did not have, learned advanced operating methods from other places, and prepared to study with relevant departments to continue improving the quality and variety of leather shoes. The processing department was also asked to trial-produce eighty new leather shoe samples. These samples have been displayed at the exhibition in order to widely solicit opinions from consumers, improve leather shoe production, and expand sales.

    汉口皮鞋为什么不好销
    张碨
    汉口的皮革，在全国享有很高的声誉。汉口也能制造皮鞋。可是，在不久以前，却必须把皮革运到上海才能做出人们所喜爱的皮鞋。北京和天津出售的皮鞋，有很大一部分是上海制造的。住在汉口的人们，有的却要在北京才能买到一双“汉口皮”的、上海制的称心的皮鞋。
    据说，本来汉口的皮鞋是畅销全国的。在解放初期，也还有东北、西北、华北等地的四十来个单位向汉口订货。可是近两三年来，由于原中国百货公司中南区公司、中国百货公司武汉采购供应站和中国百货公司武汉市公司产生了自满情绪和保守思想，他们以为汉口的皮鞋销路好、订货多，因而对于皮鞋的质量、样式、很少注意。他们在委托加工的时候，只要求每张皮子作出几双皮鞋，根本不考虑消费者是否喜爱。皮鞋生产部门也就盲目追求数量，粗制滥造。本来绱鞋线是应该打松香蜡的，因为赶数量有时就不打了。以至有的新皮鞋一穿上脚就又脱线、又漏水。加工部门有时甚至不看皮子的好坏来分用途，把坏料做鞋面，人们穿上不久，鞋面就打皱、断裂、褪色或走样；有的皮鞋带子没穿就断了。有一种黄色大舌力士平跟皮鞋，因为鞋背太低，脚穿不进去。还有一种胶底女皮鞋，后跟低、脚腰肥，穿上一走一掉，像穿拖鞋似的。
    汉口皮鞋的式样也使顾客很不喜欢。有的男皮鞋的包头又大又方又深，人们把它称为“棺材头”。女皮鞋的式样更是寥寥无几。人们说：“汉口的皮鞋还是一九三三年的老式样。”一些老皮鞋工人说：
  “汉口的皮鞋，有的还是我当徒弟时的样子。”
    汉口制的皮鞋，质量既不好，样式又古老，所以中国百货公司武汉采购供应站加工的皮鞋从一九四九年起，便开始积压下来了。一九五四年全国百货供应会议上，汉口的皮鞋就无人过问。到了去年十二月，武汉采购供应站把积压的三万多双皮鞋交给武汉市土产公司信托部去推销。在去年十二月间举行的武汉市国营商业系统潜在物品交流会上，信托部还没把皮鞋推销出去，又动员了二、三十个干部和家属到各工厂、企业去，利用赊销和减价的办法，经过两个月的时间，卖出了一万多双；还存有一万多双，现在有很多已经发霉、脱线、褪色、打皱、变样，有的连皮子也断裂，后跟也掉了。
    在最近武汉市举办的提高产品质量改进花色品种的展览会上，国营商业部门揭露了上述的缺点，并开始改变过去那种只管数量不管质量的加工办法。武汉采购供应站还派人到上海、北京等地搜集了几十种武汉没有的皮鞋样品，学习了外地先进的操作方法，并准备同有关部门研究继续改进皮鞋的质量和品种，还要加工部门试制了八十种新的皮鞋样品。这些样品已经在展览会上陈列出来，以便向消费者广泛地征求意见，改进皮鞋生产，扩大销路。
