Goose and duck feathers

Goose and ducks are common domestic poultry raised in rural China. Goose and duck meat can not only supply the domestic people for consumption, but also be exported after freezing. In particular, its by-product—feathers—is one of China's main export commodities.

China's goose and duck feather production is very large, reaching about 140,000 dan (7000 metric tons) per year. The main producing areas of goose and duck feathers in China are the provinces along the Yangtze River and the Pearl River Basin, especially Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, which are most suitable for raising geese and ducks due to their dense lakes and crisscrossing rivers. Therefore, geese and ducks are plump and strong, and their feathers are full and shiny, with a production volume accounting for one-third of the total national goose and duck feather production, and the quality is also the best in the country.

Goose and duck feathers are light, soft, warm, elastic and wear-resistant, making them far superior to silk floss and cotton wadding for filling quilts, pillows, mattresses and other bedding, and are therefore popular among consumers in China and around the world.

Due to their large output and good quality, Chinese goose and duck feathers have been exported to various countries around the world for a long time, and enjoy a high reputation in the international market. Especially after liberation, the national goose and duck feathers are uniformly purchased and processed by the state-owned animal products company, eliminating the adulteration and fraud by illegal private merchants and hawkers, ensuring and improving the natural quality of the feathers, and thus becoming a best-selling commodity that is in great demand in the international market.

The export value of goose and duck feathers is very high. Based on an annual output of about 140,000 dan of goose and duck feathers, after processing and export, it can be exchanged for more than 90,000 metric tons of steel or more than 1,700 tractors. Therefore, developing the goose and duck breeding industry can not only prosper the rural economy, but also have a very important significance for promoting national socialist industrialization. However, due to the floods in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huai River basin last year, many goose and duck hatcheries were submerged, and the sources and prices of eggs and feeds were also seriously affected, so the number of geese and ducks raised has decreased compared with the past. The leading organs in these areas should take active measures to change this situation, so as not to affect the export of goose and duck feathers. At present, most of the private goose and duck hatcheries are scattered in various townships, and their production capacity is already very weak. Since suffering from the floods, their production has been paralyzed due to the temporary lack of recovery funds. State-owned commercial departments should actively lead them and help them overcome financial difficulties through loans and other means. In addition, we should actively develop goose and duck hatchery production cooperatives or state-owned hatcheries to expand the number of goose and duck hatchings. The egg purchasing departments and grain supply departments need to pay enough attention to and assist in solving the problems of egg species and feed required for hatching geese and ducks.

    鹅鸭的羽毛
    蒋汉杰
    鹅、鸭是我国农村普遍饲养的家禽。鹅、鸭的肉除可供应国内人民食用外，冷冻后还可以出口，特别是它的副产品——羽毛，更是我国的主要出口商品之一。
    我国鹅、鸭的羽毛产量很大，每年约达十四万市担左右。我国鹅、鸭羽毛的主要产区为长江两岸各省和珠江流域一带，其中尤以安徽、江苏两省，由于湖沼密布河泊交错，最适于饲养鹅、鸭。所以鹅、鸭肥硕壮大，而且羽毛丰满，色泽光洁，不仅产量占全国鹅、鸭羽毛总产量的三分之一，质量也为全国之冠。
    鹅、鸭的羽毛轻柔暖和，富有弹性且耐磨，用来填絮被、枕、褥等卧具，远胜丝棉和棉絮，因此一向为本国及世界各国消费者所乐于使用。
    我国鹅、鸭的羽毛，由于产量大、品质好，很久以前就已外销世界各国，而且在国际市场上极有威望。特别是解放以后，全国鹅、鸭的羽毛由国营畜产公司统一收购和加工，杜绝了不法私商和毛贩掺杂作假，保证并提高了羽毛的天然质量，因而成为国际市场上争购的畅销商品。
    鹅、鸭的羽毛出口价值是很大的。以年产量约十四万市担的鹅、鸭羽毛计，经过加工整理出口，就可以换回九万公吨以上的钢材或一千七百余部拖拉机。因此发展饲养鹅、鸭业，不仅可以繁荣农村经济，而且对促进国家社会主义工业化也有很重要的意义。但是，由于去年长江下游和淮河流域一带遭受水灾，很多鹅、鸭孵坊被淹没，蛋源、蛋价和饲料也都受到严重影响，因而鹅、鸭饲养量已较前减少，这些地区的领导机关，应该采取积极措施改变这种情况，以免影响鹅、鸭羽毛的出口。目前私营鹅、鸭孵坊大都分散在各地乡镇，生产能力本来就很薄弱，自遭受水灾后，由于一时缺乏恢复资金，生产更陷于瘫痪状态。国营商业部门应积极领导他们并通过贷款等方式，帮助他们克服资金困难。另外，还应积极发展鹅、鸭孵坊生产合作社或国营孵坊，以扩大鹅、鸭孵育数量。对于孵鹅、鸭所需的蛋种和饲料问题，则需要蛋种收购部门和粮食供应部门给予足够的重视并协助解决。
