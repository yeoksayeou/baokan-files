    Syria Thanks the Soviet Union for its Concern for the Security Issues of the Middle and Near East
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 23rd, TASS dispatch: Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov received Farid Hanani, the Syrian Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Soviet Union, on the 23rd.
    Farid Hanani said that he was instructed to express, on behalf of the Syrian government and the entire Syrian people, their gratitude to the Soviet government for the statement issued by the Soviet Foreign Ministry on April 16 regarding the security issues of the Middle and Near East. The Syrian government expresses its gratitude for the concern and attention shown by the Soviet government towards the events in the Middle and Near East during such a difficult situation, and for the Soviet government's intention to submit this issue to the United Nations for consideration if Western countries continue to exert pressure.
    Molotov replied that the Soviet Foreign Ministry's statement expressed the Soviet government's views on the current situation in the Middle and Near East, as well as its attitude towards the facts concerning Syria. Molotov asked Farid Hanani to convey his thanks to the Syrian government for its attitude towards the aforementioned statement of the Soviet Foreign Ministry. Molotov said that the Syrian government could be assured that the Soviet government would firmly maintain the position outlined in the Soviet Foreign Ministry's statement.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, April 22nd, TASS dispatch: Ali Buzo, a member of the Syrian Parliament and Secretary-General of the Syrian People's Party, made a statement to the Damascus correspondent of the "Telegraph" regarding the Soviet Foreign Ministry's statement on the security issues of the Middle and Near East: "Anyone who remembers the events and changes that have taken place in Syria since the first day of its struggle against imperialism will remember with gratitude the lofty position taken by the Soviet Union in the United Nations on the issue of the independence of Syria and Lebanon.
    The position taken by the Soviet Union in the United Nations when discussing various Arab issues has always been favorable to those Arab countries, part of whose territory is directly occupied by foreign troops and another part of whose territory is indirectly occupied by foreign troops. The actions taken by this great country now to protect those small countries that are resolutely fighting for their rights, freedom, independence, and autonomy are completely consistent with its past positions. In the current environment, Syria should adopt neutrality between the two opposing camps in order to safeguard its own security."

    叙利亚感谢苏联对中近东安全问题的关切
    新华社二十四日讯　塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯：苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫二十三日接见了叙利亚驻苏联特命全权公使法里德·哈尼。
    法里德·哈尼说：他受命代表叙利亚政府和叙利亚全体人民，对于苏联外交部四月十六日就中近东安全问题发表的声明向苏联政府表示感谢。叙利亚政府对于苏联政府在如此棘手的局面下对中近东事件表示的那种关切和注意，对于苏联政府表示的如果西方国家继续施加压力就要把这一问题提交联合国考虑的意图，表示感谢。
    莫洛托夫回答说，苏联外交部在声明中表达了苏联政府对当前中近东局势的看法，以及对有关叙利亚的事实的态度。莫洛托夫请法里德·哈尼向叙利亚政府转达谢意，表示感谢上述对苏联外交部声明的态度。莫洛托夫说，叙利亚政府可以相信，苏联政府将坚决保持苏联外交部声明所阐明的立场。
    新华社二十三日讯　塔斯社贝鲁特二十二日讯：叙利亚议会议员、叙利亚人民党总书记阿里·波佐就苏联外交部关于中近东安全问题的声明对“电讯报”驻大马士革记者发表谈话说：“凡是记得叙利亚从同帝国主义进行斗争的第一天起所发生的事件和变化的人，都怀着感激的心情记得苏联在联合国中对叙利亚和黎巴嫩的独立问题所采取的崇高立场。
    苏联在联合国中讨论阿拉伯各种问题时所采取的立场，始终是有利于那些一部分领土被外国军队直接占领、另一部分领土被外国军队间接占领的阿拉伯国家的。这个伟大的国家现在采取的为保护那些正在坚决为争取自己的权利、自由、独立和自主权而斗争的小国的行动，是同它过去的立场完全吻合的。在目前的环境下，叙利亚应当在两个对立阵营中采取中立，才能保障自己的安全。”
