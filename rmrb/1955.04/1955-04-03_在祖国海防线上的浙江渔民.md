To the worker and farmer brothers and sisters in the rear of the motherland, forwarded by the editor:

    Recently, many working comrades and newspaper reporters have asked us to tell you about the struggles of the Zhejiang coastal fishermen against the enemy at sea. We thank you and the people of the whole country for your support.

    When we heard that the steelworkers of Anshan and the models on the agricultural production front were working enthusiastically to build a beautiful socialist society, we, the fishermen living on the ocean, also expressed our determination: while doing a good job in fishery production, we must assist the Chinese People's Navy to guard the southeast coast of the motherland; we are a "bright eye" on the coastline of the motherland.

    It is difficult for us to fully explain the situation of the struggle against the enemy here in a short space, let us tell a little story!

    That was between the winter of 1953 and September 1954.

    On the eleventh day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar in the summer of 1953, we had already gone to sea. We didn’t catch any fish that day, and everyone lived in a temporary thatched shed built on Tongpen Island (less than twenty miles from the enemy-occupied island of Beiji). Suddenly a sampan drifted in from the northwest. At that time, everyone was very vigilant, and their eyes were very sharp, so they immediately paid attention to the movement of this boat. The sampan docked, with three people, each with a short gun tucked inside their clothes. As soon as they landed, they asked us for food.

    The young people exchanged glances, and pretended to go to a thatched shed to find food for them and have a meeting; leaving a few old men to continue talking with them. The young people discussed and decided: catch them first; if they are our own people, it doesn't matter if we catch them by mistake. Saying that, they took some coarse snacks and immediately returned to the beach.

    The old men said: The boat encountered headwinds and the people are in difficulty, go to the thatched shed to shelter from the wind; it is very warm there. At first, these guys insisted on not leaving the boat. They touched their pistols and looked at our faces, showing a cowardly and guilty look everywhere. However, hunger and cold made them have to leave the sampan and go to the thatched shed.

    Now the three people were divided into two groups. Two people went to the thatched shed, and one person stayed on the boat. We very smoothly knocked down the guy who stayed on the beach, confiscated his gun, and tied him up securely on the side. With weapons in our hands, we were not afraid of anything.

    The two guys who were eating snacks in the house were very cunning. The snacks were almost finished, and we had not found a chance to strike. If he ran out of this house, it would be even more difficult to deal with. Time did not allow us to wait any longer. We gritted our teeth and rushed up to hug the two guys tightly. We who catch fish only know how to catch big sharks and hairtails, and we lack experience in capturing armed bandits and special agents. Fortunately, we were strong, and no matter how hard they struggled, they could not break free; until we confiscated a gun from outside, this cunning guy obediently put down his weapon. In this way, we caught three armed agents in less than three hours.

    The story did not end here. On June 28, 1954, the enemies in Beiji came to retaliate. They sent special agent Ji Dechang to inquire about the situation first. As soon as this guy came, he was aggressive, claiming to be here to take revenge; if we did not hand over the people, we would burn the island and kill the fishermen. Later, seeing that we were not scared by him, he turned around and said: It is better to settle disputes than to make enemies, let's forget about the past, you take out five hundred yuan to settle this dispute! Several of us were about to beat him up, but unexpectedly, this guy saw that the situation was not good and bluffed for a while before quietly slipping away. On September 19, he came again, this time not to say revenge, but to collect money. That day we entertained him with meat and wine. This guy got drunk after drinking, and while he was sleeping soundly, we grabbed his neck, took his pistol, and sent him to the public security department.

    The stories are endless, and there are many, many similar things. At present, the task before us is: to better assist the People's Liberation Army in guarding the southeast coast of the motherland, and to strive to complete this year's fishery production increase plan. We hereby guarantee to you and the people of the whole country: we must complete the task given to us by the motherland.

### 在祖国海防线上的浙江渔民

    在祖国海防线上的浙江渔民编辑同志请转祖国后方的工人和农民弟兄们：
    最近有不少的工作同志和报社的记者，要我们向你们说说浙江沿海渔民在海洋上对敌斗争的情况。我们感谢你们和全国人民给予我们的支持。
    当我们听到鞍山的钢铁工人和农业生产战线上的模范热情地为建设美好的社会主义而努力的时候，我们生活在海洋上的渔民，也表示了自己的决心：在搞好渔业生产的同时，要协助中国人民海军，看守这祖国东南沿海的大门；我们是祖国海防线上的“一只明快的眼睛”。
    我们很难用短短的篇幅把这里全面的对敌斗争情况讲清楚，让我们讲一点故事吧！
    那是一九五三年冬天至一九五四年九月间的事情。
    一九五三年夏历十一月十一日那天，我们已经下海了，这天恰好没打鱼，大伙住在铜盆岛上临时搭成的茅棚里（这里到北麂敌占岛屿不足二十里）。突然从西北方向飘来一只舢板，那辰光大家的警惕性都是很高的，眼睛也是很尖的，马上就注意着这只船的动静。舢板靠岸了，三个人，每个人的衣服里面都插了一根短枪。一上岸就向我们要吃的。
    青年人交换了一下眼色，便装着帮他们找吃的去，跑到一个茅棚里开会去了；留下几个老汉，继续和他们拉扯。青年人商量的结果是：先逮起来再说；如果是自己人，逮错了也不碍事。说着，他们拿了一点粗点心，马上又回到海滩上来了。
    老汉们说：船遇逆风，人在难中，到茅棚里去避避风吧；那里很暖和。开始，这几个家伙坚持不肯离开这条船，他们摸了摸自己的手枪，又看了看我们的面孔，处处显出贼胆心虚的样子。可是，饥饿和寒冷毕竟叫他们不得不离开舢板到茅棚里去。
    这下三个人分成两股。两个人到茅棚里去，一个人留在船上。我们很顺利的把留在海边的这个家伙撩倒了，缴了他的枪，捆绑得结结实实的放在一边。我们手中有了武器，什么也不怕了。
    正在屋子里吃点心的两个家伙很狡猾，点心快要吃完了，我们还没有找到动手的机会。如果让他跑出了这座屋子，那就更难对付了。时间再也不许我们等待了，我们咬着牙齿猛扑上去紧紧地抱住了那两个家伙。我们这些拿鱼的，只会钓大鲨鱼、捕带鱼，对于捕捉武装匪特还缺乏经验。好在我们的力气大，不管他怎样挣扎也挣不脱；直等到我们外面缴到一根枪拿来了，这个狡猾的家伙才乖乖地放下武器了。这样，我们在三个钟头不到的时间内，逮住了三个武装特务。
    故事到这里并没有结束。一九五四年六月二十八日，北麂的敌人来报复了。他们派了特务季德昌先来探听情况。这家伙一来，气势汹汹，声称是来报仇的；我们如不交出人来，就要把岛子烧光，渔民杀光。后来看看我们没有给他吓住，就掉转花头说：冤家宜解不宜结，过去的事就算了吧，你们拿出五百元了结这场纠纷吧！我们几个人正准备揍他一顿，不料这家伙看见势头不对诈唬了一阵就悄悄地溜走了。到九月十九日，他又来了，这次来不是说报仇的，说是来取款子的。当天我们招待他吃肉、喝酒。这家伙一喝就喝醉了，我们乘着他睡得正熟的时候，就卡住他的脖子，夺下他的手枪，把他送到公安部门去了。
    故事是说不完的，类似这样的事情还很多很多。目前，摆在我们面前的任务是：要更好地协助人民解放军看守祖国东南沿海的大门，并为完成今年的渔业增产计划而努力。我们谨向你们及全国人民保证：一定要完成祖国给予我们的任务。
