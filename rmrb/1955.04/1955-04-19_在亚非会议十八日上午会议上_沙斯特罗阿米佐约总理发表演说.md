Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, April 18th: Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo delivered a speech at the morning session of the Asian-African Conference on April 18th. He first welcomed all the delegates attending the conference on behalf of Indonesia and the other initiating countries of the conference.

He said: "An unfortunate shadow has fallen upon this conference, because we are very sorry to hear that, due to the tragic plane crash, not all those who came to Bandung are with us at the conference. I would like to express my sincere condolences to the Prime Ministers of the People's Republic of China and India, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the families of all those who lost their lives in this disaster."

Sastroamidjojo then quoted the communique of the Bogor Conference to explain the purposes of the Asian-African Conference: (a) to promote goodwill and cooperation among Asian and African countries; (b) to discuss social, economic and cultural issues and relations; (c) to discuss issues related to national sovereignty, racism and colonialism; (d) to discuss the position of Asia and African and their peoples in the world today, and the contributions they can make to promoting world peace and cooperation. He said: "Let these objectives be the guide in our discussions."

He said: "It can be said that this conference arose because the time was ripe, a time that allows the independent countries of Asia and Africa to undertake new tasks in the destiny of mankind. But I dare to say that the main reason for the emergence of this conference is the distressing tension the world is suffering today." He emphasized: "What we want is genuine peace." "The prerequisite for this is the willingness and determination to live in harmony, regardless of each other's political, social or religious ideologies, based on the principles of mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutualNon-aggression, Non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit. In recent times, prominent Asian leaders and politicians have loudly put forward and emphasized these principles, believing them to be necessary conditions for achieving world peace."

Sastroamidjojo pointed out that, unfortunately, there are many suspicions, anxieties and misinterpretations of these principles, and some people describe politicians who emphasize these principles as unrealistic dreamers.

He asked, are the dreamers those who believe in the above principles, or those who fantasize that stockpiling atomic and hydrogen bombs can bring peace?

He pointed out, "It is the concept of Asia and Africa that must be seen as the realistic and logical answer to the question of how to achieve genuine peace."

"In order to achieve these goals, we ourselves must begin to promote goodwill and cooperation among the peoples of Asia and Africa, and establish and promote good neighborly relations."

Sastroamidjojo said that colonialism is one of the main sources of today's tensions, and colonial countries are still trying to continue to control former or semi-colonial countries under this or that disguise. He said that the principle of self-determination is being improperly used to mask colonial purposes. He expressed regret that not every Asian and African country was represented at the meeting. He said that the principle of holding meetings of independent governments in Asia and Africa was accepted, "However, we are very concerned about our brothers who are still bound. I hope that one day—may that day come soon—opportunities will arise or be created to convene a conference of representatives of independent movements in all colonies that are still struggling to eliminate colonial rule and for their national independence and autonomy. We, the independent countries of Asia and Africa, must do everything in our power to support all their efforts that may enable them to gain freedom."

Sastroamidjojo said that racism is another important source of tension. "Discrimination based on skin color is a violation of the basic human rights and essential equality of mankind that are justly enshrined in the United Nations Charter. I am convinced that the conference will find it its duty to consider all aspects of the race problem."

Sastroamidjojo then spoke about the low living standards in Asian and African countries, saying, "For centuries, these countries of ours have been endlessly transferring profits to the ruling countries, but we ourselves remain poor and backward. Our political freedom cannot bring us economic independence, nor can it eliminate the backwardness and underdevelopment that has long plagued the people of our countries.

"We cannot completely change all this overnight, but we can undoubtedly achieve close cooperation among us in the economic field, learn from each other, help each other, try to promote inter-regional trade, and gradually achieve economic independence."

Sastroamidjojo also urged cultural cooperation between the peoples of Asia and Africa.

He went on to say, "The whole world is watching this conference with great attention and great hope. They are watching with great attention because our gathering together on such a large scale is a fresh and unique phenomenon in history, and they are watching with great hope because many people around the world expect us to show them the way out of the predicament we are in today.

"Therefore, let us speak with one voice, no matter how different our languages ​​and ideologies may be, a voice that not only the people of Asia and Africa will understand, but the whole world will understand.

"Let us fully realize that our responsibility is to make a solid contribution to promoting world peace and cooperation.

"On the other hand, let the rest of the world take due notice that what will be heard from this conference hall is the voice of nearly two-thirds of the world's population."

Sastroamidjojo concluded: "If we can express our desire and determination for peace in unambiguous terms, if our labor will have some beneficial influence on human thought, if we can contribute to the elimination of fear and poverty that we all eagerly hope for, then this conference will have accomplished its historic task."

    在亚非会议十八日上午会议上
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理发表演说
    新华社万隆十八日电　印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约在亚非会议十八日上午会议上发表演说。他首先代表印度尼西亚和其他会议发起国家向全体出席会议的代表们表示欢迎。
    他说：“不幸的阴影罩上了这个会议，因为我们非常惋惜地听到，由于悲惨的飞机失事事件，并不是所有前来万隆的人都和我们一起参加了会议。我谨向中华人民共和国和印度的总理和越南民主共和国的代表团以及在这次灾祸中牺牲了性命的全体人员的家属表示真切的哀悼。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约接着引述了茂物会议的公报来说明亚非会议的目的是：（甲）促进亚非各国间的亲善和合作；（乙）讨论社会、经济与文化问题和关系；（丙）讨论有关民族主权的问题、种族主义和殖民主义的问题；（丁）讨论亚洲和非洲以及它们的人民今天在世界上的地位，以及它们对于促进世界和平和合作所能作出的贡献。他说：“让这些目的成为我们讨论中的指南吧。”
    他说：“可以这样说，这次会议是由于时机成熟而产生的，这个时机使亚洲和非洲的独立国家在人类的命运方面负起新的任务。但是我敢于这样说，产生这次会议的主要原因是今天世界正遭受的令人苦恼的紧张局势。”他强调说：“我们希望的是真正的和平。”“这方面的先决条件是，不管彼此的政治、社会或宗教思想体系怎样，根据互相尊重国家主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利的原则和睦地相处的意愿和决心。最近时期以来，亚洲的卓越领袖和政治家大声提出了并强调了这些原则，认为它们是获致世界和平的必要条件。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约指出，不幸，对于这些原则有许多猜疑、不安和错误的解释，有人把强调这些原则的政治家说成是不现实的空想家。
    他问道，到底空想家是相信上述原则的人呢，还是那些幻想储存原子弹和氢弹能带来和平的人呢？
    他指出，“正是亚洲和非洲的概念，必须被看做是解答如何获致真正的和平的问题的现实的逻辑答案。”
      “为了实现这些目的，我们自己必须开始促进亚非人民之间的亲善和合作，建立和促进良好亲睦的关系。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约说，殖民主义是产生今日紧张局势的主要根源之一，殖民国家仍然力图在这种或那种伪装下继续控制以前的殖民地国家或半殖民地国家。他说，自决原则被不正当地用来掩饰殖民的目的。他对并不是每一个亚洲和非洲的国家都派有代表出席会议一节表示遗憾。他说，举行亚洲和非洲的独立政府的会议的原则是被接受了，“但是，我们非常关切仍旧受着束缚的我们的弟兄。我希望有一天——愿这一天很快到来——将产生或创造出机会，来召开仍在为清除殖民统治、为自己的民族独立和自主而斗争的一切殖民地的独立运动的代表们的会议。我们亚洲和非洲的独立国家必须尽我们的一切力量支持它们所进行的可能使它们获得自由的一切努力。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约说，种族主义是产生紧张局势的另一种重要的根源。“根据肤色的不同而实行的歧视，是违反联合国宪章中所正当地载明了的基本人权和人类的必要的平等的。我确信会议将发现它有责任来考虑种族问题的各个方面。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约接着谈到亚洲和非洲国家生活水平低的问题，他说，“若干世纪以来，我们这些国家一直永无止境地源源不断地把利润交给统治国家，但是我们自己则仍旧贫困和落后。我们的政治自由还不能给我们带来经济独立，还不能消除使我们国家人民长期以来遭受痛苦的落后和不发达的现象。
    “我们不能在一夜之间使这一切完全改变，但是我们无疑可以做到在我们中间在经济方面进行密切的合作，互相学习，互相帮助，设法促进区域间的贸易，逐渐在经济上达到独立。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约还敦促亚非国家人民之间进行文化合作。
    他接着说，“全世界正抱着极大的注意和极大的希望注视着这个会议。他们所以抱着极大的注意是因为我们这样大规模地共聚一堂在历史上是新鲜的，独一无二的现象，他们所以抱着极大的希望是因为全世界许多人期望我们给他们指出走出我们今天所处的困境的途径。
    “因此，让我们不管我们的语言、我们的思想体系有多大的不同，异口同声地说一样的话吧，这种话不但亚洲和非洲的人民会了解，就是全世界也会了解的。
    “让我们充分认识到，我们的责任是对促进世界和平和合作作出坚实的贡献。
    “另一方面，让世界的其余地区理所应当地注意到，从这个会议厅中听到的将是世界人口的近三分之二的声音。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约最后说：“如果我们能够用毫不含糊的言词表明我们争取和平的愿望和决心，如果我们的劳动将会对人类思想发生一些有益的影响，如果我们能够对于我们大家热切希望的恐惧和贫乏的消除作出贡献，那么，这次会议就完成了它的历史性的任务。”
