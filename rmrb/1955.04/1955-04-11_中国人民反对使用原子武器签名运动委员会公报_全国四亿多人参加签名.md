Xinhua News Agency, April 10th: Public Communique of the Chinese People's Committee for the Signature Campaign Against the Use of Atomic Weapons.

The signature campaign of the Chinese people against the use of atomic weapons, which began on February 14th, has achieved great results in less than two months and has now successfully concluded. The number of people in our country who participated in the signing has reached 400,055,997.

The development of this signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons was very widespread and in-depth, reaching the level of "known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people." The "Appeal to the People of the World" issued by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council has received warm support from the Chinese people. Workers, peasants, women, youth, state organ workers, commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, patriotic people from all walks of life, and people of various occupations, nationalities, parties, and religious beliefs in our country have all responded to the call of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council and enthusiastically participated in the signature drive. Our country's scientific workers played an active role in the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons. Through writing and lectures, they introduced to the broad masses of the people the outstanding achievements and bright future of the peaceful use of atomic energy, and sternly denounced the heinous conspiracy of US imperialism to launch an atomic war and destroy the peaceful and happy lives of mankind.

The tremendous achievements of this signature campaign once again demonstrated the great strength of the unity of the Chinese people, and once again demonstrated the will and determination of the Chinese people to defend peace and oppose war. This signature campaign vividly proves that the Chinese people are peace-loving and are engaged in peaceful labor, pursuing the great cause of building their own motherland. The Chinese people firmly oppose the US policy of aggression and will never be intimidated by the atomic weapons blackmail and threats of US imperialism. In order to safeguard their sovereignty, the Chinese people must fight to the end for the sacred task of liberating Taiwan, the territory of the motherland. The Chinese people are willing to unite with peace-loving people from all countries in the world to strive to ease international tensions, reduce armaments, prohibit the use of atomic weapons, and defend peace in Asia and the world.
