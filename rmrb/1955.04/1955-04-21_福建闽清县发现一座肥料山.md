    Fujian Minqing County Discovers a Fertilizer Mountain
    Minqing County, Fujian Province, recently discovered a fertilizer mountain – Keyangtianshan Mountain. According to preliminary estimates, the fertile soil of this mountain can supply more than 80,000 mu of farmland for ten years.
    This mountain is located at the central point of the fourth, fifth, and sixth districts of Minqing County. The mountain has a type of brownish-yellow mountain soil that contains a certain fertilizing effect. Using it as fertilizer not only improves soil fertility and increases crop yield, but also improves the soil.
    According to residents on the mountain and farmers who have planted trees on the mountain: Planting sweet potatoes on the mountain, even without fertilizer, one plant can yield three to four catties. If carefully cultivated and planted, one plant can yield thirty catties. Dry rice can yield an average of 500 catties per mu. One pumpkin plant can produce four to five pumpkins, each weighing fifty catties. Rice paddies below the mountain that receive mountain water can yield more than three to four hundred catties of single-season rice per mu. However, neighboring fields that do not receive mountain water only yield one to two hundred catties per mu.

    福建闽清县发现一座肥料山
    福建省闽清县最近发现一座肥料山——柯洋天山。据初步估计，这座山的肥土可供八万多亩农田施用十年。
    这座山位在闽清县四、五、六区的中心点，山上有一种含有一定肥效的棕褐色山土，用它当作肥料施用，不仅可以提高土壤肥力，增加作物产量，而且还能改良土壤。
    据山上居民和曾在山上种过树的农民说：在山上种蕃薯，不施肥一株也能收到三、四斤，如能认真培土栽种，一株能收三十斤。旱稻每亩平均可收五百斤，南瓜一株可生四、五个，每个都有五十斤重。山下凡有山水流到的稻田，每亩单季稻产量在三、四百斤以上。而邻近没有山水流到的田，每亩只收一、二百斤。
