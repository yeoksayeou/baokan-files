    The Flashy and Impractical Western Suburbs Guest House
    By our reporter Fan Rongkang

    Dominated by a “Traditional Image”
    The main building, south annex, north annex, auditorium, and other buildings under construction or planned for construction at the Western Suburbs Guest House in Beijing, amount to a total construction area of approximately 160,000 square meters.

    This enormous complex was designed by architect Zhang Bo and his colleagues at the First Design Studio of the Beijing Design Institute. They emphasized that the Western Suburbs Guest House was situated in an environment of “distant mountains and nearby trees,” close to the Summer Palace, and intended to host international friends. Therefore, they tried their best to adopt the “traditional image,” “classical style,” and “classical color scheme” of Chinese architecture. This idea might seem correct, as ancient Chinese architecture was, after all, a product of the art of the working people. However, it was also limited by ancient social conditions and not suitable for our modern needs. The designers of the Western Suburbs Guest House completely failed to consider these issues, blindly imitating ancient architectural forms and piling them together. For example, on the main building, they used countless colorful brackets, eaves rafters, and flying rafters to support a large roof covered with emerald green glazed tiles, with golden gable flowers painted on the sides. The parapet of the main building was entirely decorated with small glazed tile eaves extending outward. The main entrance was decorated with glazed door frames, glazed railings, glazed wall patterns, and painted with various colored designs. The auditorium used a lot of glazed tiles, marble, white marble, plaster flowers, and gold leaf; even the carvings on the radiator covers were gilded. The architects even transplanted the image of the old niches where Buddha statues were placed in temples. In the lobby of the auditorium, they built five niches out of emerald green marble, each carved with seven decorative edges. The architects still didn't think they were beautiful enough, so they carved flowers on the marble patterns. No one can say what these niches are actually for.

    The architects certainly put a lot of effort into pursuing the “traditional image,” “classical style,” and “classical color scheme.” Workers building the Western Suburbs Guest House told me that the pattern on the ceiling of the auditorium was originally square. The architects didn't like it and ordered it to be torn down and changed to a tortoise-back shape when it was almost finished. As soon as the colors were painted on, they didn't like it and ordered it to be wiped off and redone, again and again, countless times, often resulting in superfluous and forced efforts.

    Flashy but Impractical
    Architecture must be practical and embody the socialist principle of caring for people. The designers of the Western Suburbs Guest House sacrificed practicality to accommodate the “traditional image.”

    The facade of the main building has rows of windows, which are considered “monotonous.” The architects designed eight concrete window grilles to be embedded in the two rows of windows on either side of the main entrance. The facade decoration seems to be “enriched,” but these eight rooms are therefore in a state of darkness all year round. The four rooms on the south side are bathrooms, so it doesn't matter much if they are dark. The four rooms on the north side are bedrooms. The sunlight casts the shadow of the window grilles on the ground, here and there. Looking out, the window grilles are like dense bars, blocking your view, creating a sense of confinement in addition to the darkness.

    The “traditional image” includes a platform base, so the architects made the outer wall of the main building's basement protrude outward, forming a fake platform base. The platform base is there, but where should the basement windows be placed? Placing them on the facade would naturally destroy the effect of the "traditional image" of the platform base. The architects cut off more than half of some of the windows, leaving only a small section peeking out from behind the fake platform base. In another part of the basement, they simply opened the windows on the ceiling of the fake platform base. This part of the basement, except for a small patch of sunlight filtering through the skylight, is completely dark and needs to be lit from morning till night.

    In the south and north annexes, there are more than forty bedrooms that once posed a problem. These bedrooms, which are less than twelve square meters, already have a room door, a wardrobe door, and a door to the bathroom, which are very cumbersome. The architects added a large balcony for the sake of external beauty, and then opened a large door leading to the balcony. With small rooms and many doors, it is inconvenient to put the bed on either side. Finally, they found a trick: to erect the originally horizontal radiator to free up space for it and squeeze a bed in.

    In order to show "there are no auxiliary buildings in my design", the architects centralized the main boiler room and main kitchen in the auditorium building. Regardless of the fact that the auditorium is located in the middle of this building complex, setting up the main boiler room in such a place and installing a large chimney means that some of the houses will be blown with coal dust no matter which way the wind blows. They also disregard how much interference will occur between these many buildings squeezed together, so that a stage equipped with more than twenty dressing rooms, actor lounges, and rehearsal halls, and equipped with twenty-nine backdrop hoists, which can perform large dramas, does not have a high door to transport the backdrops and props in. They had to open up the wall between the stage and the restaurant to transport the backdrops through the restaurant.

    There are six staircases in the main building, and now four of them are out of service. Large locks have been added to the doors at the entrances of each staircase. The reason is that the architects left spaces between the spiral staircases that were wider than the stair treads. Looking down from above, you can only see the railings of the stairs curving down and down, straight to the dark basement. The space in the middle is so big and so deep that standing at the entrance of the stairs is like standing on the cliff of a bottomless abyss. Guests have to worry day and night, always afraid that their children will fall down from here one day. Thus, four staircases were closed off.

    From these facts, we can see a red line of formalism running through the architectural design of the Western Suburbs Guest House. The socialist architectural principles of practicality and care for people have become victims of formalistic architectural design thinking.

    Serious Waste
    Adopting the styling of the “traditional image” and putting a large roof on a high-rise building increases the load by two times compared to an ordinary roof, thus requiring a series of additional building materials and greatly increasing the construction cost. The main building and auditorium of the Western Suburbs Guest House alone used more than 500 brackets, more than 90 corner beams, and more than 7,000 overhanging rafters just for the large roof and small rolled sheds. Taking the main building alone, its construction area and structure are exactly the same as the New Overseas Chinese Hotel completed last year, but due to the large roof and more interior and exterior decoration, the cost is more than 1 million yuan higher than the New Overseas Chinese Hotel. The large roof alone cost 190,000 yuan more than a general flat roof.

    To make the details have a “classical style” and the colors have a “classical color scheme,” the architects used a large number of glazed components and gilded everything, painted beams and carved pillars, which also cost a lot of money. In 1954 alone, the Western Suburbs Guest House used 300,000 glazed tiles, worth more than 200,000 yuan. The gold leaf alone cost more than 200,000 sheets, and the five niches in the lobby of the auditorium alone cost more than 10,000 yuan.

    However, this kind of waste is still visible and calculable. As for the waste caused in the long-term building management, it cannot be calculated in numbers. In order to prevent the large roof of the main building from being "overly solemn and prominent", the architects used dozens of concrete pillars to support rows of wooden beams, forming four rows of long flower racks to connect the large roof with the small rolled sheds on both sides. If the user wants to prevent these flower racks from being nominal, they need to purchase a large number of potted plants of vines and add a group of maintenance workers. I don't know how much the expenses will increase? The beams and dense brackets of the outer eaves, which are tens of meters high, are full of colorful paintings. In order to prevent pigeons from flying up and defecating, the architects specially covered them with wire mesh, but the wire mesh blocked the pigeons from flying up and defecating, but could not block the long-term wind and rain. Today's gold and green paintings, tomorrow's fading and peeling, will cost a lot of money to rebuild the scaffolding alone?

    The more serious waste is the large-scale use of special materials and gilding and painting everywhere. The construction was forced to deviate from the advanced experience of mechanization and factory production and fell into backward manual operation, unable to move forward for a long time. The plane of the auditorium was arranged in a fan shape, with a large front and a small back, a total of forty-one elevations and more than eight hundred beam types. Each place was different from the other, and there were many difficulties in construction and many reworkings. The doors and windows of the south and north annexes have a total of sixty-three styles, which unnecessarily increased the difficulty of processing. Gilding and painting is an ancient manual work that only experienced painters can do. Ordinary stonemasons could not do the marble carving project on the niches. The workers from the Shenyang Marble Factory could not do it. In the end, they had to ask the workers who built the People's Heroes Monument for help.

    What made the construction unit particularly difficult was the silver-gray axe-cut brick. This kind of brick needs to be polished on five sides and laid up one by one. The main building alone used more than 5,000 square meters of axe-cut brick. However, what kind of brick can withstand polishing on five sides? The architects proposed to the construction unit to use Chengjiang bricks produced in Mancheng County, Hebei Province. The engineer of the construction unit specially took a train to Mancheng County. After inquiring everywhere, he found a small village. There were two earth kilns there that had burned Chengjiang bricks for the construction of the imperial palace for the Manchu Dynasty, but they had been closed for many years. The engineer finally found an old man. After repeated persuasion and mobilization, and explaining the great righteousness of "supporting socialist industrialization", he agreed to resume his old business and open the kiln to burn bricks. The capacity of the two broken kilns was limited after all, and the production process of Chengjiang bricks was relatively complicated. How could it keep up with the construction needs? In addition, after the Chengjiang bricks came out of the kiln, they had to be transported to the railway station by cart on more than a hundred miles of rural roads, and then loaded onto trains to be transported to the construction site. After several loadings and unloadings along the way, although the quality of Chengjiang bricks was good, they were not steel plates or iron blocks. After this toss, of the first batch of 30,000 Chengjiang bricks transported to the construction site, only a few thousand were intact. The construction unit had to ask people to tie the Chengjiang bricks five by five with straw ropes before loading them. Once tied and transported, the cost of Chengjiang bricks increased three times compared to when they came out of the kiln. It took more than 12,000 workdays to polish the five sides of the Chengjiang bricks.

    Formalistic architectural design thinking sacrifices the principle of architectural suitability and inevitably sacrifices the principle of architectural economy.

      Where Does the Responsibility Lie?
    The architectural design of the Western Suburbs Guest House also has its good sides. For example, the architects adopted a mixed structure in some buildings, which is still a good phenomenon for high-rise buildings in our country. Moreover, in a relatively short period of time, under the difficult conditions of insufficient design data and tasks being assigned in batches, the architects did make a lot of efforts to complete such a heavy design task.

    As the main person in charge of the architectural design of the Western Suburbs Guest House, Zhang Bo should bear the main responsibility for the errors in this architectural design. But this does not mean that others have no responsibility. The basic construction department in charge of the construction of the Western Suburbs Guest House bears considerable responsibility for this formalistic architectural design error. Of course, this guest house undertakes important tasks. As long as the money is spent where it should be, it is okay to spend a little more money. However, the construction unit did not strengthen the collection of design data, review of drawings, and financial supervision, and urge the architects to use every yuan of investment in the most necessary places. Instead, they believed that "spending a little more money can always build a good house". As a result, more money was spent, but a good house was not obtained.

    Comrade Shen Bo, president of the Beijing Design Institute, adopted a liberal attitude towards the formalistic architectural design of the Western Suburbs Guest House, believing that "as long as Party A agrees," which fueled the development of the error.

    In addition, the construction quality of the Western Suburbs Guest House by the Beijing Third Construction Engineering Company was not good. Guests moved into the building, and the engineering company still sent dozens of workers to do repair work.

    The formalistic architectural design of the Western Suburbs Guest House was criticized by workers in many ways during construction. Unfortunately, the architects did not calmly consider these opinions at the time, resulting in irreparable losses.

    厉行节约，反对基本建设中的浪费！
    华而不实的西郊招待所
    本报记者  范荣康
    在“传统形象”的支配下
    北京市西郊招待所已经建成的主楼、南配楼、北配楼、大会堂和正在建筑及即将建筑的其他建筑物，共约十六万平方公尺建筑面积。
    这个巨大的建筑群，是北京市设计院的建筑师张镈和他所领导的第一设计室的同志们设计的。他们强调西郊招待所处在“远山近树”的环境中，临近颐和园，又是用来招待国际友人的，因而尽量采用我国建筑的“传统形象”、“古典作风”和“古典色调”。这个想法似乎是并不错的。因为我国古代建筑毕竟是劳动人民艺术的创造。但是它们又毕竟是受了古代的社会条件的限制，并不适合于我们现代生活的需要。西郊招待所的设计人员完全没有考虑到这些问题，一味盲目地模仿古代建筑的形式，并且把它们集中堆砌在一起。比如在主楼上，他们采用无数根彩色的斗拱、檐椽、飞椽托着一座铺满翠绿色的琉璃瓦，侧面绘有金色山花的大屋顶；把主楼的女儿墙全部用琉璃瓦的小瓦檐装饰起来，向外伸展；正门上装饰了琉璃门框、琉璃栏、琉璃墙花和绘有各色图案的彩画；大会堂用了许多琉璃瓦，大理石，汉白玉，石膏花和金箔，甚至暖气片罩子的雕花上，也被贴上了金。建筑师还把庙宇里放佛像的旧壁龛的形象也搬来了，在大会堂的门厅里用翠绿色的大理石砌成五座壁龛，每座刻有七道雕边，建筑师还觉得不漂亮，又在大理石的花纹上雕花，这些壁龛究竟有什么用处，谁也说不出来。
    建筑师们为了追求“传统形象”“古典作风”
  “古典色调”，确实花了不少心血。建筑西郊招待所的工人们告诉我，观众厅天花板的图案原是方格形的，建筑师们嫌不好看，快要完工时叫拆掉，改成龟背脊形；彩墨刚描上了，嫌不好看，也叫抹掉重做；三番五次，不计其数，以至往往弄成画蛇添足和削足适履的情况。
    华而不实
    建筑，必须是适用的，必须体现出对人的关怀的社会主义原则。西郊招待所的设计者，却牺牲适用去迁就“传统形象”。
    主楼的立面上都是一排排的窗户，未免“单调”，建筑师设计了八块混凝土窗花嵌在正门两边的两排窗户上。立面装饰好像是“丰富”了，但这八间房子却因此长年处在阴暗状态中。南边四间是卫生间，暗就暗点关系还不大；北边四间正是寝室，阳光把窗花的阴影投射在地面上，东一摊、西一摊；往外看，那窗花像密密的栏栅一样，挡住你的视线，阴暗以外，更有一种闭塞的感觉。
    “传统形象”中有台基，建筑师就把主楼地下室的外墙向外突出，砌成假台基。台基是有了，地下室的窗户安在哪里呢？安在立面上，自然破坏了台基这“传统形象”的效果，建筑师就把一部分窗户给截掉一大半，只留了一小节窗户在假台基的后面探着脑袋；在另一部分地下室里，索性把窗户开在假台基的顶棚上，这一部分地下室里，除了从天窗里透过一小块阳光外，全是漆黑一团，从早到晚都得点灯。
    在南配楼和北配楼，有四十多间曾经令人作难的寝室。这些不足十二平方公尺的寝室里，安了一个房门，一个壁橱门，一个通卫生间的门，已经很碍事了，建筑师为了外形上的美观，还加了一座大阳台，再开一扇通到阳台的大门，屋小门多，不论把床铺放在哪一边都碍事。最后，总算找到一个窍门，把原先是横放的暖气片竖起来，腾出放暖气片的地方，挤进一张床去。
    为了显示“我设计的建筑里没有附属建筑”，建筑师把总锅炉房，总厨房都集中在大会堂的建筑里。却不顾大会堂位于这个建筑群的中部，在这样的地方设置总锅炉房，安上一根大烟囱，不管刮那一个方向的风，都有一部分房屋会吹进煤屑；也不顾这许多建筑挤在一起，相互间将发生多少干扰，以致一个设有二十多间化装室、演员休息室和排演厅，装有二十九道布景吊杆，可以演大戏的舞台没有一座把布景和道具运进去的高门，只得打通舞台和餐厅的壁墙，借道餐厅搬运布景。
    主楼上有六处楼梯，现在有四处被禁用了。各层楼梯口的大门上都加了大锁。原因是建筑师在盘旋而上的楼梯之间，留下了比楼梯踏步还要宽的空间。从上往下看，只见楼梯的栏杆一弯一弯地向下落，直落到黑黝黝的地下室去。当中的空间那样大，那样深，站在楼梯口，就像是站在万丈深渊的悬崖上。客人们不得不日夜操心，总害怕有朝一日自己的孩子会从这里跌下去。就这样，四处楼梯被封闭了。
    从这些事实里，我们可以看到一条形式主义的红线，贯穿在西郊招待所的建筑设计里。适用和对人的关怀的社会主义的建筑原则，变成了形式主义建筑设计思想的牺牲品。
    严重的浪费
    采用“传统形象”的造型，把一座大屋顶盖在高层建筑上，要比普通的屋顶增加两倍的负重，因而需要增加一系列的建筑用料，大大提高建筑造价。仅西郊招待所的主楼和大会堂，这两个建筑的大屋顶和卷棚小亭，就用了五百多个斗拱，九十多个角梁，七千多根挑檐椽子。单拿主楼来说，它的建筑面积和结构，和去年完工的新侨饭店完全相同，只是由于盖上了大屋顶，内外装修比较多，造价就比新侨饭店贵了一百多万元，光大屋顶就比一般平顶多花了十九万元。
    细部要有“古典作风”，色彩要有“古典色调”，建筑师们就大量采用琉璃制件，到处贴金箔，雕梁画栋，也要多花许多钱。西郊招待所单是一九五四年，就用了三十万件琉璃瓦，价值二十多万元。单是金箔就贴了二十多万张，单是大会堂门厅里的五个壁龛就用了一万多元。
    然而，这种浪费还是可以看得见、算得出的。至于给长期的房屋管理中造成的浪费，就无法以数字来统计了。建筑师为了不使主楼的大屋顶“过分严肃突出”，用数十根混凝土柱子，顶着一排排木梁，组成四排长长的花架，把大屋顶和两旁的卷棚小亭连结起来。使用单位如果要使这些花架不致形同虚设，要购买大批藤类的盆花，添一批养护的工人。不知要增加多少开支？那高达数十公尺的外檐的梁枋和密密的斗拱上绘满彩画，建筑师为预防鸽子飞上去拉屎，特地用铁丝网罩起来，但铁丝网挡住了鸽子飞去拉屎，却挡不住天长日久，雨打日晒，今天是金碧辉煌的彩画，明天褪色的褪色，脱落的脱落，重新修缮一次，单是搭那么高的脚手架，又要花多少钱？
    更严重的浪费是大量采用特殊材料，到处贴金彩画，施工被迫脱离了机械化、工厂化的先进经验，陷在落后的手工操作中，迟迟不能前进。大会堂的平面被布置成扇形的，前大后小，共有四十一个标高，八百多号梁型，一处和一处不一样，施工中困难重重，返工特多。南配楼和北配楼的门窗共有六十三种样式，徒然增加了加工的困难。贴金彩画，更是古老的手工细活，非老彩画工不能胜任。壁龛上大理石的雕花工程，一般石工不会作，沈阳大理石厂来的工人不会作，最后只得请建造人民纪念碑的工人来帮忙。
    特别使施工单位感到困难的，是那银灰色的斧刃砖。这种砖，需要五面磨光，一块一块地对上去砌起来。单是主楼采用的斧刃砖就有五千多平方公尺。然而，什么样的砖才经得起五面磨光呢？建筑师向施工单位提出要采用河北省满城县出产的澄浆砖。施工单位的工程师特地坐了火车亲自赶到满城县去，到处打听、才找到一个小村子。那里有两座土窑，当年曾为满清王朝建造皇宫烧过澄浆砖，但如今早已闭窑多年了。工程师好不容易才找到一个老头儿，再三说服动员，晓以“支援社会主义工业化”的大义，才答应重操旧业、启窑烧砖。那两座破窑能力毕竟有限，澄浆砖的生产过程又比较复杂，那能跟得上施工需要？再加上澄浆砖出窑后，要经过一百多里的乡村小路，用大车运到火车站，再装上火车运到工地。一路上几番装卸，澄浆砖质量虽好，到底不是钢板铁块，经这一折腾，第一批运到工地的三万块澄浆砖里，完好无损的只剩下几千块。施工单位只得请人在装车前，用草绳把澄浆砖五块五块的捆起来。这一捆，一运，澄浆砖的成本就比出窑时增加了三倍。把澄浆砖五面磨光，又花了一万二千多工日。
    形式主义的建筑设计思想，牺牲了建筑的适用原则，也必然牺牲了建筑的经济原则。
      责任何在
    西郊招待所的建筑设计，也有好的一面。例如建筑师在部分建筑中，采用了混合结构，这对于我国的高层建筑来说，还是一个好的现象。而且在比较短促的时间里，在设计资料不足、任务分批下达的困难情况下，完成了这样繁重的设计任务，建筑师们确实是作了不少努力的。
    作为西郊招待所建筑设计的主要负责人，张镈对这个建筑设计的错误是要负主要责任的。但这不等于说其他人就没有任何责任。主持西郊招待所建筑的基本建设部门，对这个形式主义的建筑设计错误，是负有相当责任的。当然，这个招待所担负着重要的任务，只要这些钱用在该用的地方，是可以多花一点钱的；但建设单位没有加强搜集设计资料、审核图纸和财政监督工作，督促建筑师把每一元投资都用到最必要的地方去，反认为“多花一些钱，总可以盖出好房子来”。结果，钱是多花了，并没有换来好房子。
    北京市设计院院长沈勃同志，对西郊招待所形式主义的建筑设计采取了自由主义态度，认为“只要甲方同意就行了”，助长了错误的发展。
    此外，北京市第三建筑工程公司建筑西郊招待所的工程质量是不好的，客人搬进了大楼，工程公司还派了几十个工人在作补修工程。
    西郊招待所形式主义的建筑设计，在施工中曾遭到工人们的多方责难，可惜当时建筑师们没有冷静地考虑这些意见，以致造成了无法弥补的损失。
