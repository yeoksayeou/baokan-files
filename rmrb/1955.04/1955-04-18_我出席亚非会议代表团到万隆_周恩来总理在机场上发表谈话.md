Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, April 17th: The delegation of the People's Republic of China to the Asian-African Conference, led by Zhou Enlai, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, arrived in Bandung on the 17th by plane from Jakarta. The Indonesian Ambassador to the People's Republic of China, Mr. Mononutu, accompanied the Chinese delegation to Bandung.

Prime Minister of Indonesia, Sastroamidjojo, welcomed the Chinese delegation at the airport.

Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech at Bandung Airport, the full text of which is as follows:

    The delegation of the People's Republic of China comes to participate in the Asian-African Conference to be held in Bandung with ardent wishes for peace and friendship.

    The convening of the Asian-African Conference is inseparable from the efforts of the Indonesian government and people. At this conference, representatives of Asian and African countries will have the first historical opportunity to discuss common issues together; this fact demonstrates the great significance of this conference. At the same time, I must point out that some people do not like our conference. They are trying to sabotage our meeting. As everyone knows, the delegation of the People's Republic of China has paid a heavy price for this. Similarly, India, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and other countries have also suffered heavy losses in this sabotage. However, the just cause of peace and friendship cannot be undermined. I believe that our conference will certainly be able to overcome all kinds of sabotage and obstruction, and make valuable contributions to promoting friendship and cooperation among Asian and African countries and to maintaining peace in the Asian-African region and the world.

    As we set foot on the beautiful land of the Republic of Indonesia for the first time, please allow me, in the name of the government and people of the People's Republic of China, to extend our warm greetings to the government and people of the Republic of Indonesia.

    May the friendship between China and Indonesia develop day by day.

    I wish the Asian-African Conference success.

    我出席亚非会议代表团到万隆
    周恩来总理在机场上发表谈话
    新华社万隆十七日电　出席亚非会议的中华人民共和国代表团在中华人民共和国总理兼外交部长周恩来率领下，十七日乘飞机从雅加达抵达万隆。印度尼西亚共和国驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使莫诺努图陪同中国代表团一道抵达万隆。
  印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约到机场欢迎中国代表团。
    周恩来总理在万隆机场上发表谈话，全文如下：
    中华人民共和国代表团抱着对于和平和友好的热烈愿望，前来参加即将在万隆举行的亚非会议。
    亚非会议的召开，是同印度尼西亚政府和人民的努力分不开的。在这次会议上，亚非国家的代表们将会获得历史上的第一次机会，在一起讨论共同有关的问题；这个事实就说明了这次会议是有重大意义的。同时我不能不指出有些人是不喜欢我们这个会议的。他们正在力图破坏我们的会议。大家知道，中华人民共和国的代表团已经为此付出了沉重的代价。同样，印度、越南民主共和国和其他国家在这次破坏事件中也遭受了沉重的损失。但是和平友好的正义事业是破坏不了的。我相信，我们的会议一定能够克服各种破坏和阻挠，并对于促进亚非国家之间的友好和合作，对于维护亚非地区和世界的和平作出有价值的贡献。
    在我们第一次踏上印度尼西亚共和国的美丽的国土的时候，请允许我以中华人民共和国政府和人民的名义向印度尼西亚共和国政府和人民热烈地致意。
    祝中国同印度尼西亚之间的友谊日益发展。
    祝亚非会议成功。
