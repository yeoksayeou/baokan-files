Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 7th. This reporter reports from the Fujian front on the victorious scene of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's anti-aircraft artillery unit completely annihilating the Chiang bandit planes that scurried into the Jinjiang area:

　　On the morning of April 3rd, the sky over the Fujian front was covered with dark clouds. Two US-made Chiang bandit F-47 type aircraft, using the cover of the clouds, sneaked into the airspace over a certain area of Jinjiang County, attempting to carry out harassment activities. When these two Chiang bandit planes had just scurried towards a certain location, the artillerymen of the anti-aircraft artillery unit, who were vigilantly guarding the skies of the motherland, immediately turned their thick gun barrels from their respective positions, tightly aiming at the enemy planes. Gunner Zhang Zeneng and others had recently made a pact with the third gunner to compete in killing the enemy and training soldiers. Seeing the opportunity to kill the enemy arrive, he stared unblinkingly at the command light; according to the signals issued by the command light, he quickly loaded one shell after another into the gun chamber, and together with other cannons, opened fire on the Chiang bandit planes that had just emerged from the clouds. After being subjected to fierce shooting, the Chiang bandit planes hurriedly escaped into the clouds to hide. Later, one Chiang bandit plane on the front left side and another on the rear right side swooped down again towards our military positions. Just as these two Chiang bandit planes poked their heads out, not having had time to drop bombs or strafe, our cannons simultaneously bombarded them, and a series of fiery tongues immediately surrounded the enemy planes. In the second volley, both of these Chiang bandit planes were hit. The one flying in front was seriously injured and fled crookedly towards the waters over Quanzhou Bay. The one flying in the rear was hit in the oil pipe, immediately burst into flames, and crashed in the fields near Suqian Village. Luo Muwen, the Chiang bandit air force second lieutenant pilot who was piloting the plane, parachuted down and was captured alive on the spot. At this point, the air combat, which lasted less than ten minutes, ended victoriously.

    守卫在晋江地区的高射炮部队击落击伤两架蒋贼飞机的经过
    新华社福建前线七日电　本社记者报道福建前线中国人民解放军高射炮部队全歼窜扰晋江地区的蒋贼飞机的胜利情景说：
    四月三日上午，福建前线天空中阴云密布，两架美造蒋贼F—四七型飞机，借着云层的掩护，偷偷地窜入晋江县某地上空，妄图进行骚扰活动。当这两架蒋贼飞机刚向某地窜来时，警惕地守卫着祖国天空的高射炮部队的炮手们立刻从各个阵地上转动起粗大的炮筒，紧紧瞄准着敌机。一炮炮手张泽能等前几天和三炮炮手们订立了杀敌和练兵竞赛计划，他看到杀敌的机会到了就目不转睛地盯着指挥灯；根据指挥灯发出的信号，迅速地把一颗接一颗的炮弹装进了炮膛，协同别的大炮一齐向刚从云层里钻出来的蒋贼飞机开火。蒋贼飞机遭到猛烈射击后，慌忙逃进云层中匿藏起来。后来，蒋贼飞机一架在前左侧、一架在后右侧又向我军阵地俯冲下来。这两架蒋贼飞机刚刚露头还没来得及投弹和扫射，我军的大炮便同时向它们轰击起来，一串串的火舌顿时把敌机全部包围住了。在第二个齐放中，这两架蒋贼飞机就全被命中了。飞在前面的一架受了重伤，歪歪斜斜地朝着泉州湾海面上空逃跑了。飞在后面的一架被击中了油管，当场冒起烟火，摔毁在苏前村附近的田野中，驾驶这架飞机的蒋贼空军少尉飞行员罗穆文跳伞降落后，当场被活捉了。至此，历时不到十分钟的对空作战便胜利地结束了。
