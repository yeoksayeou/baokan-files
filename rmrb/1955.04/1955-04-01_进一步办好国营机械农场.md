State-operated mechanical farms are socialist agricultural enterprises. They occupy a leading position in the country's agricultural economy and have an important demonstrative role in the socialist transformation of agriculture. Running the existing farms well and developing new farms in a planned way is of great political and economic significance to the advancement of the socialist transformation of agriculture and the entire national economic construction.

Under the correct leadership of the Party and the People's Government, China's state farm enterprise has achieved a certain degree of development in recent years. At present, there are 101 state-operated mechanical farms nationwide, with a cultivated area of approximately 2.8 million mu. It accounts for a very small proportion of China's agricultural economy. However, it is a socialist enterprise, implementing modern large-scale management methods, and most of the grain it produces is commodity grain. Therefore, it demonstrates great superiority in agricultural production and has a significant demonstration effect on the vast number of farmers.

Under China's current conditions, it is not yet possible to develop state farms on a large scale. Because building a large number of state farms requires huge funds; the state's current investment focus is on industry, especially heavy industry, in order to lay the foundation for national industrialization, and it cannot invest a large amount of funds in state farms. Building a large number of state farms requires many new-style machines; if we cannot establish a strong heavy industry as soon as possible, we cannot manufacture agricultural machines in large quantities. Furthermore, in terms of cadres and experience, it is also difficult to establish state farms on a large scale immediately.

Therefore, the development of state farms can only proceed gradually, adapting to the needs of the country and based on possible conditions. In the next three years, we must strive to consolidate and improve existing farms, develop new farms in a planned way, and actively prepare for the large-scale construction and reclamation in the future.

Demonstrating to farmers, producing grain for the country, accumulating construction funds, accumulating experience, and training cadres are the basic tasks of state farms. In recent years, China's state farms have strived to achieve the above tasks and have made certain achievements. The management level of various farms has improved to varying degrees. The grain yield per unit area of ​​national farms in 1954, excluding those affected by disasters, increased by approximately 20.7% compared with 1953. The grain unit cost of 14 farms in Heilongjiang Province in 1954 decreased by 22% compared with 1953. In 1954, nearly 50 farms across the country had already made profits, some of which were new farms established that year. However, these achievements are far from keeping up with the state's requirements for the development of state farm undertakings. Moreover, in the process of advancement, state farms still have many problems. The most important of these are: the improvement of business management level has not kept up with the needs of work development; there is great blindness in the work of developing new farms, insufficient preparation, and excessive demands; some farms were hastily established without surveying and design, causing great losses to the country.

Based on the experience of the past few years, clearly defining management policies, establishing the concept of enterprise management, and improving management level are the keys to running state farms well. State farms must strive to increase production and reduce costs. In 1954, the state-owned "September 3rd" Mechanical Farm established basic accounting work, mobilized employees to calculate detailed accounts, and formulated production and cost plans, reversing the unprofitable situation. This experience vividly illustrates the significant role of employees' enthusiasm in realizing planned management, increasing production, and reducing costs.

In order to realize planned management, it is necessary to implement economic accounting, meticulous calculation, tap potential, find tricks, increase production and save resources, and overcome waste. Farm leaders should be responsible for formulating plans, rely on employees, mobilize the masses, stipulate reasonable quotas, implement a responsibility system, and determine work plans, so that planned management becomes the conscious action of all employees and the masses on the farm. Farm leaders must establish advanced management ideas and overcome petty-bourgeois management ideas and residual supply system ideas. This is the key to running existing state farms well.

Strengthening technical management and improving agricultural technology and machinery technology levels are also important methods to increase production and reduce costs. In the advanced mechanized large-scale agricultural economy, machinery technology should ensure the realization of agricultural technology requirements, and agricultural technology should adapt to the needs of large-scale mechanized operations. It is also necessary to gradually establish a set of cultivation systems and methods suitable for mechanized operations to more effectively utilize land fertility and mechanical efficiency. State farms should absorb experienced local farmers to participate in labor, and farm workers should also study and collect information on local natural conditions and production aspects. By using these methods, combine the production experience of elderly farmers and high-yield models near the farm, the advanced agricultural technology experience of the Soviet Union, and the original successful experience of our country, and formulate comprehensive technical measures and future development directions based on the specific conditions of the farm.

State farms must plan to develop a multi-department agricultural economy and overcome the phenomenon of excessive specialization and single management. Each farm should adapt to local natural conditions, rationally determine the leading production department, and develop the production of other departments in coordination with the leading production department. This can not only rationally use production materials and labor, overcome the seasonal unevenness caused by single management, but also effectively utilize land, give play to the equipment utilization rate of machines, accelerate capital turnover, and fully utilize the by-products of various departments in order to increase production, reduce costs, and increase income.

Strengthening the political work and Party leadership of farms is an important guarantee for consolidating and improving existing farms. The basic task of political work in state farms is to unite all employees in the farm and ensure the completion of production tasks. The leading cadres of the farm must establish the idea of "relying on employees to run the farm well", mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of all employees in the farm, enable them to carry forward the spirit of being masters of their own affairs, and continuously improve labor productivity, and strive to achieve the overall requirements of increasing production and reducing costs. Farm leaders should pay attention to the safety of employees and care about the lives and welfare of employees; with the development of production, gradually improve the lives of employees; and oppose the bureaucratic style of simply emphasizing labor intensity and ignoring the health and welfare of employees.

State farms must unite the farmers near the farm and provide them with regular assistance and demonstrations. For example, helping nearby agricultural production cooperatives solve technical and management problems; providing nearby farmers with assistance in terms of fine varieties and cultivation techniques as much as possible; using agricultural machinery to cultivate for cooperatives at no loss; and regularly organizing exhibitions and visits to conduct demonstration education for farmers. This is the task that state farms must undertake. Ignoring and underestimating these tasks will reduce the due demonstration role of state farms.

The Party organizations of farms should also educate all employees in the farm to be vigilant against the sabotage activities of hostile elements and consolidate this socialist economic organization politically and organizationally.

Running the existing farms well and relying on the existing farms to develop new farms are inseparable tasks. In the future, when preparing to build new farms, it is necessary to do a good job in surveying and design, transfer experienced cadres, conscientiously grasp the principle of "less investment, quick results, large harvests, and no competition with the people for land", spend as little money as possible, do more things, adapt to local conditions, operate diligently and thriftily, and carry out the basic construction of the farm based on meeting production needs and ensuring production. Existing farms must actively prepare for the future development of new farms in the next two or three years.

Military reclamation farms and labor reform farms are all socialist economies. Military reclamation farms are the backbone force for the large-scale development of state farms in the future, and they should also train a large number of cadres and tractor drivers for future state farms. Local agricultural departments should actively assist public security departments in running labor reform farms well, and labor reform farms should also strive to move forward based on the specific conditions of their farms.

Party organizations at all levels must strengthen their leadership over state farms, regularly check the farm's management policies and actual work, help them overcome difficulties and solve problems, so that state farms can fully play their due demonstration role and truly become a lever for promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture on a new technological basis.

Now is the season for spring plowing and sowing, and all state farms should immediately conduct a comprehensive inspection of the preparation work for spring sowing. If there are any omissions, they should be remedied immediately. Agriculture is different from industry, and large-scale agriculture is different from small-scale agriculture. Large-scale agriculture must seize the opportunity and master the season. Whoever ignores this will make mistakes.

### 进一步办好国营机械农场

    进一步办好国营机械农场
    国营机械农场是社会主义性质的农业企业。它在国家的农业经济中居于领导的地位，在农业的社会主义改造过程中有重要的示范作用。办好现有的农场，有计划地发展新场，对农业的社会主义改造事业和整个国家经济建设事业的前进，具有重大的政治意义和经济意义。
    我国的国营农场事业，在党和人民政府的正确领导下，几年来获得一定程度的发展。目前全国国营机械农场已有一百零一个，耕地面积约二百八十万亩。它在我国农业经济中占的比重还非常小。但是，它是社会主义性质的企业，它实行现代化大规模的经营方法，它所生产的粮食绝大部分是商品粮食。因此，它在农业生产中显示了极大的优越性，对于广大农民有巨大的示范作用。
    在我国当前条件下，还不可能大量发展国营农场。因为大量建设国营农场，需要有庞大的资金；国家当前投资的重点是工业，尤其是重工业，以便打下国家工业化的基础，还不能把大量资金投放在国营农场方面。大量建立国营农场，需要有许许多多的新式机器；我们如果不能尽快地建立起强大的重工业，就不能大量制造农业机器。再就干部和经验方面的条件来说，马上大规模建立国营农场也是困难的。
    因此，国营农场的发展，只能逐步前进，既要适应国家的需要，又要根据可能的条件。在今后三年以内，要努力巩固和提高现有农场，有计划地发展新农场，积极为将来大量建场垦荒做准备。
    向农民示范，为国家生产粮食，积累建设资金，积累经验和培养干部，这就是国营农场的基本任务。几年来，我国国营农场努力实现上述任务，取得了一定的成绩。各个农场的经营管理水平在不同程度上提高了。全国农场除受灾的以外，一九五四年的粮食单位面积产量比一九五三年约提高百分之二十点七。黑龙江省十四个农场一九五四年的粮食单位成本，比一九五三年降低百分之二十二。一九五四年全国有近五十个农场已经获得利润，其中有些是当年才建立的新场。但是，以上这些成绩，还远远赶不上国家对国营农场事业发展的要求。而且在前进过程中，国营农场还存在不少问题。其中最主要的是：经营管理水平的提高还赶不上工作发展的需要；在发展新场的工作中有很大的盲目性，准备不足，要求过急，有些农场未作勘测设计就仓促建立，给国家造成很大损失。
    根据几年来的经验，明确规定经营方针，树立企业化经营思想，提高经营管理水平，是办好国营农场的关键。国营农场要努力提高产量，降低成本。一九五四年国营“九三”机械农场建立基层核算工作，发动职工算细账，制定生产和成本计划，扭转了经营无利的状况，这个经验生动地说明了职工的积极性对于实现计划管理，提高产量，降低成本的重大作用。
    为了实现计划管理，必须贯彻经济核算制，精打细算，挖潜力，找窍门，增产节约，克服浪费现象。农场负责人应该负责制定计划，在依靠职工、发动群众的基础上，规定合理定额，实行责任制，确定作业计划，使计划管理成为全场职工群众自觉的行动。农场的领导者必须树立先进的经营思想，克服小农经营思想和残余的供给制思想，这是办好现有国营农场的关键。
    加强技术管理，提高农业技术和机务技术水平，也是提高产量、降低成本的重要方法。在先进的机械化的大农业经济中，机务技术应该保证实现农业技术的要求，农业技术应该适应大规模机械化作业的需要。还必须逐步建立一套适合机械作业的耕作制度和方法，更有效地发挥地力和机械效能。国营农场应该吸收当地有经验的农民参加劳动，农场工作者更要研究搜集当地自然情况和生产方面的资料，用这些方法，把农场附近的老年农民和丰产模范的生产经验、苏联先进的农业技术经验，和我国原有的成功经验结合起来，根据本场的具体条件，订出综合性的技术措施和今后的发展方向。
    国营农场必须有计划地发展多部门农业经济，克服过分专业化和单一经营的现象。各个农场要适应当地的自然条件，合理地确定主导生产部门，并配合主导生产部门，发展其他部门的生产。这样不但可以合理使用生产资料和劳动力，克服单一经营所引起的季节性的忙闲不均现象，还可以有效地利用土地，发挥机器的设备利用率，加速资金周转，充分利用各部门的副产品，以便提高产量，降低成本，增加收入。
    加强农场的政治工作和党的领导，是巩固和提高现有农场的重要保证。国营农场政治工作的基本任务是团结全场职工，保证完成生产任务。农场的领导干部要树立“依靠职工办好农场”的思想，发动全场职工的积极性和创造性，使他们发扬主人翁的精神，不断提高劳动生产率，为实现提高产量、降低成本这一总的要求而努力。农场领导人员要注意职工的安全，关怀职工的生活福利；随着生产的发展，逐步提高职工的生活；反对单纯强调劳动强度，忽视职工健康和福利事业的官僚主义作风。
    国营农场要团结农场附近的农民，对这些农民经常进行帮助和示范。例如，帮助附近的农业生产合作社解决技术和经营管理方面的问题；在优良品种、耕作技术等方面，尽可能地给附近农民以援助；在不亏本的条件下用农业机器给合作社代耕；定期组织展览、参观，向农民进行示范教育。这是国营农场必须担负的任务，忽视和轻视这些任务，都将降低国营农场应有的示范作用。
    农场党组织还应该教育全场职工，警惕敌对分子的破坏活动，从政治上、组织上巩固这种社会主义的经济组织。
    办好现有农场，依靠现有农场发展新场，这是不可分割的任务。今后筹建新场，必须做好勘测设计等准备工作，抽调有经验的干部，认真掌握“投资少、收效快、收获大、不与民争地”的方针，尽可能少花钱、多办事、因地制宜、勤俭经营，从满足生产需要和保证生产出发，进行农场的基本建设。现有农场在今后两三年内，必须积极作好将来发展新场的各种准备工作。
    军垦农场、劳改农场都是社会主义性质的经济。军垦农场是将来大规模发展国营农场的骨干力量，它还应该为将来的国营农场培养大批干部和拖拉机手。各地农业部门应积极协助公安部门办好劳改农场，劳改农场也应该根据自己农场的具体情况努力前进。
    各级党组织要加强对国营农场的领导，定期检查农场的经营方针和实际工作，帮助他们克服困难解决问题，使国营农场充分发挥应有的示范作用，真正成为在新的技术基础上促进农业的社会主义改造事业的杠杆。
    现在已到春耕播种季节，各个国营农场应该立即把春播准备工作普遍检查一遍，凡有缺漏，立即加以补救。农业和工业不同，大农业和小农业又有不同，大农业更要抓紧时机，掌握季节。谁忽视了这点，就要犯错误。
