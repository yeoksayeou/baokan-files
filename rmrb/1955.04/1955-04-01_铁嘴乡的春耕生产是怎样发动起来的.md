    How Spring Ploughing Production Was Launched in Tiezui Township
    By Our Correspondent Gu Weijin
    Hu Jixiang, a cadre from the Propaganda Department of the CPC Echeng County Committee in Hubei Province, is a young man in his twenties. He has a very grounded work style and is good at going deep into the masses to discover problems. Recently, he achieved good results in mobilizing farmers in Tiezui Township to carry out spring ploughing production.
    After arriving in Tiezui Township, Hu Jixiang inquired about the spring ploughing production situation from the district cadres working there. The district cadres said, "We don't know much about the production situation, but we do know something about mutual aid and cooperation." He then inquired about the spring ploughing production situation from the township cadres. The township cadres also couldn't say much. After further investigation, he learned that when the county assigned work to the lower levels, it emphasized rectifying mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and talked very little about how to combine this work with production. As a result, this phenomenon occurred. Hu Jixiang felt that this one-sided approach was wrong and offered suggestions to the district cadres. Some district cadres said, "The county wants experience in rectifying agricultural producers' cooperatives. If we don't do this, how can we complete the task?" Hu Jixiang said, "Rectifying agricultural producers' cooperatives is very important, but it must be combined with spring ploughing production; otherwise, it will definitely not be rectified. Furthermore, the township suffered a flood in 1954, and the farmers had no harvest. Doing a good job in spring ploughing production this year is decisive for restoring the economy of the disaster area." These words attracted the attention of the district cadres. They examined their work during this period and found that they had only been focusing on rectifying agricultural producers' cooperatives and had not achieved any results. For example, some old cooperatives only focused on contracting work and output to households, and newly established cooperatives only focused on resolving outstanding issues (i.e., resolving issues such as the pricing of cattle and farm tools when joining the cooperative). They did not arrange for the current spring ploughing tasks, but only assigned work temporarily each day, implementing "rigid division and rigid recording," which made the members very dissatisfied, and the work of rectifying the cooperatives could not be carried out. In addition, because the nine main township cadres concentrated their efforts on rectifying agricultural producers' cooperatives, they did not lead the production of mutual aid teams. The members of the teams were very dissatisfied and said, "The cooperatives are bustling, and the mutual aid teams are neglected." After analyzing the above situation, the district cadres began to realize that simply rectifying agricultural producers' cooperatives without combining it with production was wrong.
    When they discussed this issue with the township cadres, the township cadres said:
  "The district committee said that we must sit firmly on the stool of mutual aid and cooperation; if we don't sit firmly, we will be spanked. It seems that rectifying the cooperatives is still the most important thing. As for production, the masses will naturally take care of it." Hu Jixiang and the district cadres discussed that they must use facts to educate the township cadres. Therefore, they went deep to understand the production situation in the entire township: About 400 mu of land in the township had not been planted with early-maturing crops, the manure accumulation campaign had not been launched, the township was short of 200,000 jin of fertilizer, many wheat fields had not been top-dressed, some wheat had not been weeded, the avenues for sideline production were very narrow, and the surplus labor force could not find a way out. The thinking of the masses was confused: Some poor peasants were unwilling to actively engage in production and simply relied on government relief; middle peasants were afraid of showing their wealth and waited for the government to issue loans before buying fertilizer; rich peasants had fertilizer but did not apply it to the fields, and some people even sabotaged production. They presented these situations to the township cadres and repeatedly explained the importance of combining the rectification of agricultural producers' cooperatives with production. This time, the township cadres had no objections and agreed to change their working methods.
    Hu Jixiang, together with the district and township cadres, studied how to grasp the issue of production. However, the township cadres lacked confidence in production. Some people said, "Production is important, but the disaster is great and there are many difficulties. How can we do it? It would be difficult if the government doesn't issue relief funds and loans again." Hu Jixiang said, "How big is the disaster? How many households need relief, how many need loans, and how many have the potential for self-rescue?" The township cadres had no idea and could not answer.
    Hu Jixiang and the district cadres studied the current work and believed that it was necessary to overcome the township cadres' idea of simply relying on government relief and establish confidence in overcoming the disaster and carrying out spring ploughing production; specifically help the township cadres find ways to solve the difficulties in production; rely on agricultural producers' cooperatives to set an example in production and drive the mutual aid teams and individual farmers to carry out spring ploughing production throughout the township.
    They decided to first help the "Star One Cooperative," led by Wang Hanqing, the secretary of the CPC Township Branch, to set an example in production to promote everyone. Hu Jixiang was assigned to this task.
    Hu Jixiang and Wang Hanqing studied the production situation of the "Star One Cooperative." Wang Hanqing said, "I don't know how to do production: on the one hand, the members' livelihoods are a problem, and on the other hand, there is surplus labor with nothing to do; there is no fertilizer for accumulating manure, no money to buy fertilizer, and if the government doesn't provide relief, we can't get through the difficulties." Hu Jixiang said, "How much surplus labor has nothing to do? How much land is short of fertilizer?" Wang Hanqing calculated and said, "There are 150 mu of land short of fertilizer; out of the cooperative's 112 laborers, in addition to 40 or 50 people engaged in sideline production, 11 people have nothing to do after finishing embankment work, 52 women have nothing to do except weeding, and the cooperative cadres have nothing to do except rectify the cooperative." Hu Jixiang considered that if more than half of the cooperative members had nothing to do, of course, their livelihoods and production would be a problem. He first helped Wang Hanqing find ways to increase production: 1. In addition to the original sideline production, increase weaving and vegetable planting (as contemporary food); 2. Practice strict economy: appropriately reduce the members' daily living expenses (their living expenses were higher than those of ordinary people); 3. Mobilize the members who received flood diversion compensation payments to provide mutual loans and mutual assistance. Wang Hanqing calculated that with these avenues, the members' livelihood problems could be largely solved. Hu Jixiang then helped Wang Hanqing study how to solve the fertilizer problem. He suggested collecting lake grass as fertilizer. Wang Hanqing considered that although this method was good, they did not have those boats. Hu Jixiang asked him about the situation of all the boats in the cooperative and found that there were six broken boats. The cooperative also had people who knew carpentry, so he suggested repairing the six broken boats and adding two good boats to collect lake grass. Wang Hanqing thought this method was very good. Then Hu Jixiang helped Wang Hanqing study the labor arrangement. In the past, there was surplus labor. Currently, based on the original and increased sideline production avenues, and based on what Wang Hanqing said about the current spring ploughing tasks, they rationally arranged all 112 laborers in the cooperative: In addition to weeding, 52 women could also grow vegetables and spin cotton for the supply and marketing cooperative; 8 male laborers went out to transport (driving boats to transport firewood for the supply and marketing cooperative) and fish, 8 people sold earthwork, 16 people collected lake grass, and 7 people plowed and harrowed the fields at home, and 21 people carried pond mud, pumped water, cut field ridges, and assisted women in growing vegetables. After the labor arrangement was completed, Wang Hanqing said happily, "I didn't use my brain before, and I just asked for relief when I encountered difficulties. Now I have tapped the potential and rationally arranged the labor force. Everyone has something to do, and both spring ploughing production and sideline production have been grasped." He brought the above matters to the cooperative affairs committee for discussion, and everyone agreed to do so. Hu Jixiang and the district cadres also helped the cooperative formulate this year's agricultural production plan.
    The "Star One Cooperative" had a way to increase production. The members all improved their production confidence. They first seized the current production links, carried out wheat processing and cultivation, and manure accumulation and other production activities, and launched a competition.
    In order to use the "Star One Cooperative's" method of engaging in production to promote production throughout the township, Hu Jixiang and the district cadres first promoted Wang Hanqing to convene a branch meeting to summarize the experience of how the "Star One Cooperative" tapped its potential to overcome difficulties and rationally arranged the labor force to comprehensively grasp production. Then, they convened a meeting of the mutual aid and cooperation network in the township (absorbing the heads of the network, the directors of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and the leaders of mutual aid teams), and introduced the production experience of the "Star One Cooperative." After research and discussion, everyone improved their production confidence. In order to strengthen the leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation network and give full play to its role, the branch decided to divide the township's mutual aid and cooperation network into three sections under the unified leadership of the branch, with branch secretary Wang Hanqing (director of the Star One Cooperative), branch deputy secretary Xia Zhiming (director of the Gold Star One Cooperative), and party member Xiong Jieqing (director of the Star Four Cooperative) each responsible for leading one section.
    Because the mutual aid and cooperation network gave full play to the role of advanced cooperatives leading backward cooperatives, cooperatives leading teams, and cooperatives leading individual farmers, production in the entire township has now been launched; it has also laid a solid foundation for consolidating and improving agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams.

    铁嘴乡的春耕生产是怎样发动起来的
    本报记者　古维进
    中共湖北省鄂城县委员会宣传部干部胡吉祥是个二十多岁的青年，作风很踏实，善于深入群众发现问题。最近他在铁嘴乡发动农民进行春耕生产，就取得了比较好的成绩。
    胡吉祥到了铁嘴乡后，向在这里工作的区干部了解春耕生产情况。区干部说：“生产情况不清楚，互助合作的情况倒知道一些。”他又向乡干部了解春耕生产情况。乡干部也谈不出什么。他进一步了解情况后，才知道县里给下面布置工作时，强调了整顿互助合作组织，对如何结合生产进行这一工作谈得很少，因此，就产生了这种现象。胡吉祥感到这种单打一的作法不对头，给区干部提出意见。有些区干部说：“县里要的是整顿农业生产合作社的经验，不搞这个，完不成任务怎么办。”胡吉祥说：“整顿农业生产合作社是很重要的，但是必须结合春耕生产来搞；不然的话，一定整顿不起来。再说，一九五四年乡里遭了水灾，农民没有收成，今年搞好春耕生产对于恢复灾区经济是有决定意义的。”这话引起了区干部的注意。他们检查了这一期间的工作，只是单纯整顿农业生产合作社，并没有搞出成绩。比如有些老社光搞包工包产、新建社光解决遗留问题（即解决耕牛、农具入社作价等问题），对于当前的春耕活计没有安排，只每天临时派工，实行“死分死记”，社员很不满意，整顿社的工作也就搞不下去。另外，由于九个主要乡干部都集中精力整顿农业生产合作社，对于互助组的生产没有领导，组员都很不满意，说：“合作社热火朝天，互助组冷火抽烟。”区干部分析了以上情况，开始认识到单纯整顿农业生产合作社不结合生产是不对的。
    他们把这一问题和乡干部研究时，乡干部说：
  “区委说过，屁股要坐在互助合作凳板上，坐不稳要打屁股。看来还是整顿社要紧，至于生产，群众自然会搞。”胡吉祥和区干部研究，必须拿出事实来教育乡干部。于是他们深入了解了全乡的生产情况：全乡约有四百亩田地没有种早熟作物，积肥运动没有搞起来，全乡缺肥料二十万斤，许多小麦没有上追肥，有些小麦没有薅草，副业门路很窄，剩余劳力找不到出路。群众的思想混乱：有些贫农不愿积极生产，单纯依靠政府救济，中农怕露富，等待政府发贷款才买肥料，富农有肥不下田，有的人还破坏生产。他们把这些情况给乡干部摆出来，同时反复说明整顿农业生产合作社结合生产的重要性。这一来，乡干部没有什么意见，同意改变工作方法。
    胡吉祥同区、乡干部一块研究如何抓生产问题。但是乡干部对于生产信心不足。有些人说：“生产重要是重要，可是灾情大，困难多，怎么搞呢？政府要不再发救济款和贷款恐怕不好办。”胡吉祥说：“灾情到底有多大？有多少户要救济，有多少户要贷款，有多少户有自救潜力？”乡干部却心中无数，答不出来。
    胡吉祥和区干部研究了当前的工作，认为必须克服乡干部单纯依靠政府救济的思想，树立战胜灾荒开展春耕生产的信心；具体帮助乡干部想办法解决生产中的困难问题；依靠农业生产合作社做出生产样子，带动互助组和单干农民把全乡的春耕生产搞起来。
    他们决定首先帮助中共乡支部书记王汉卿领导的“明星一社”做出生产的样子去推动大家。由胡吉祥担任这个工作。
    胡吉祥和王汉卿研究“明星一社”的生产情形。王汉卿说：“生产不知怎么搞：一方面社员生活成问题，一方面有剩余劳力没事干；积肥没肥，买肥没钱，政府不救济，难关过不去。”胡吉祥说：“有多少剩余劳力没事干？有多少田缺肥？”王汉卿算了算说：“有一百五十亩田缺肥；全社一百一十二个劳力除四、五十人搞副业生产外，有十一人做完堤工没事干，妇女五十二人除了薅草没事干，社干部除了整顿社也没事干。”胡吉祥考虑，全社有一多半人没事干，当然生活、生产成问题。他首先帮助王汉卿找出生产的门路：一、除了搞原有的副业生产，增加纺织、种菜（当代食品）；二、厉行节约：适当减少社员每天的生活费（他们的生活费比一般人高一些）；三、动员领到分洪产量补偿款的社员进行互借互济。王汉卿合计：有了这些门路，社员的生活问题大体上可以解决。胡吉祥又帮助王汉卿研究解决肥料问题。他建议打湖草当肥料。王汉卿考虑这办法虽然好，但没有那些船。胡吉祥向他了解社里全部船的情形，发现有六只破船，社里又有人会做木匠活，便建议把六只破船修整起来，加上二只好船去打湖草。王汉卿认为这办法很好。接着胡吉祥帮助王汉卿研究劳力安排问题。过去劳力有剩余，目前他们根据原有和增加的副业门路，和根据王汉卿谈到当前的春耕生产活路，把全社一百一十二个劳力加以合理安排：妇女五十二人除了薅草外，还可种菜和给供销社纺花；男劳力出去搞运输（驾船给供销社运木柴）、打鱼的八人，卖土工的八人，打湖草的十六人，在家犁田、耙田的七人，挑塘泥、车水、切田塍和协助妇女种菜的二十一人。劳力安排完毕，王汉卿很高兴地说：“以前不动脑筋，光叫困难要救济，现在挖出了潜力，合理安排了劳力，人人有事做，春耕生产和副业生产都抓起来了。”他把以上的事情提到社务委员会讨论，大家都同意这样办。胡吉祥和区干部又帮助社里订出了今年农业生产计划。
    “明星一社”的生产有了办法。社员们都提高了生产信心。他们首先抓住当前的生产环节，进行小麦加工培育，积肥等生产活动，并展开了竞赛。
    为了运用“明星一社”搞生产的办法去推动全乡的生产，胡吉祥和区干部首先推动王汉卿召开支部会议，总结“明星一社”怎样挖潜力克服困难、合理安排劳力全面抓起生产的经验。接着又召开了全乡的互助合作网会议（吸收网的负责人农业生产合作社社长、互助组组长参加），介绍了“明星一社”的生产经验。大家经过研究讨论，提高了生产信心。支部为了加强对互助合作网的领导，充分发挥它的作用，确定在支部统一领导下，把全乡的互助合作网分成三片，由支部书记王汉卿（明星一社社长）、支部副书记夏志明（金星一社社长）、党员熊介清（明星四社社长）各负责领导一片。
    由于互助合作网充分发挥以先进社带动后进社、以社带动组和带动单干农民的作用，现在全乡的生产都发动起来了；同时也给农业生产合作社和互助组打下了巩固和提高的基础。
