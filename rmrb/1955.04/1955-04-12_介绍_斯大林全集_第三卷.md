The third volume of "The Complete Works of Stalin," translated by the Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin of the CPC Central Committee, has been published by the People's Publishing House.

Volume 3 of "The Complete Works of Stalin" includes Stalin's major essays, reports, and speeches from March to October 1917. This period was a crucial strategic stage in the development of the Russian Revolution, the preparatory period for the great October Socialist Revolution. During this period, under the wise plan formulated by Lenin for the transition from the bourgeois democratic revolution to the socialist revolution, the Bolshevik Party waged an extremely complex and tenacious struggle against the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie and the compromising petty-bourgeois parties, the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, in order to seize state power and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. Stalin, together with Lenin, led this great struggle.

Some of the works collected in Volume 3 of "The Complete Works of Stalin" demonstrate Stalin's resolute struggle to uphold Lenin's line and oppose the ideas and policies of the compromisers; they demonstrate the great leadership role of the proletarian party in the struggle to realize the socialist revolution; and they demonstrate the close integration of Marxist-Leninist theory with the actual struggle of the working class. These works also demonstrate the great mobilizing and organizing role of Lenin and Stalin's thought. These works enriched and advanced Marxist-Leninist theory with the new experience of Russia's victorious socialist revolution.

As everyone knows, the Provisional Government established in Russia after the February Revolution of 1917, which overthrew the Tsarist regime, was a government of bourgeois dictatorship. This government pursued a counter-revolutionary policy. Under these new conditions, the Bolshevik Party needed a new policy in order to push the revolution forward. In the first few days after the victory of the February Revolution, Lenin put forward the task of continuing to develop the revolution in his "Letters from Afar." On the first day of his return to Russia from abroad in early April, Lenin published his famous "April Theses," which specifically stipulated a new policy for the revolution to transition from the first stage to the second stage, i.e., the seizure of power by the proletariat and poor peasants. At the same time, Lenin also formulated a concrete plan for the transition from the bourgeois democratic revolution to the socialist revolution.

Stalin resolutely supported Lenin's line of socialist revolution. Stalin returned to Petrograd from exile on March 12, 1917, before Lenin, and immediately united the party's forces to fight for the transformation of the bourgeois democratic revolution into a socialist revolution. At that time, he published a series of essays (such as "On the Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies," "On the War," "On the Conditions for the Victory of the Russian Revolution," "Either/Or," etc.) to clarify the party's policy on issues such as the Soviets, the war, and the Provisional Government.

In the article "On the Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies," Stalin demonstrated the significance and role of the Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies in the development of the revolution, insisted on the policy of distrusting the imperialist Provisional Government, and regarded the Soviet as one of the important conditions for guaranteeing the complete victory of the Russian Revolution. He said that in order to continue to expand the revolution, the alliance of workers and peasants in military uniform must become "a conscious and strong, lasting and solid alliance... the Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies is the organ of this alliance." (Page 4) He called on workers, peasants, and soldiers to unite in the Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. In the article "On the Conditions for the Victory of the Russian Revolution," Stalin pointed out that the following conditions must be met for the Russian Revolution to be victorious: the first condition was to end the situation of the coexistence of two powers and establish a truly revolutionary state organ in order to mobilize all the vital forces of the people to oppose the counter-revolution, "only the All-Russian Soviet of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies can become such an organ"; the second condition was to immediately arm the workers and establish "their own workers' guard, which is closely linked to the interests of the revolution," because "without an armed force that is ready to serve the revolution at any time, the revolution cannot be victorious" (see pages 14 and 15). He called for another more democratic organ to replace the then Provisional Government.

After Lenin's "April Theses" were published, Stalin immediately fought resolutely to realize the principles put forward in the Theses. In his speech at the mass meeting in Vasilyevsky Island on April 18, 1917 ("On the Provisional Government"), he exposed the Provisional Government's anti-people policy, pointing out that workers and peasants could not support this government of capitalists and landlords. He called on all the poor peasants of Russia to take their affairs into their own hands, organize revolutionary peasant committees, "and through these committees seize the landlords' land and cultivate these lands in an organized and self-reliant manner."

The Bolshevik Party held its Seventh Congress on April 24, 1917. At the congress, Lenin elaborated on some of the principles he had previously put forward in the "April Theses," pointing out that the party should adopt a policy of preparing for the socialist revolution, and put forward the slogan "All Power to the Soviets." At this congress, Stalin defended Lenin's line of socialist revolution and made a report on the national question. In this report, Stalin analyzed the root causes of national oppression, demonstrated the Bolshevik Party's national policy, and criticized the reactionary slogan of "national cultural autonomy" put forward by the Jewish Labor Bund. Stalin put forward the following program of the Bolshevik Party on the national question in the socialist revolution: "(A) Recognition of the right of nations to secede; (B) Regional autonomy for nations remaining within the same state; (C) Special laws for national minorities to guarantee their free development; (D) The proletarians of all nations within the same state to form a unified and indivisible proletarian collective, forming a unified party." (Page 52) This program guaranteed the sympathy and support of the oppressed nations of Russia for the proletarian revolution, and laid the foundation for the friendly unity of all nations after the victory of the October Socialist Revolution.

After the Seventh Congress, the Bolshevik Party, in accordance with the program formulated by Lenin and Stalin, launched a massive effort to win over the masses in order to transform the bourgeois democratic revolution into a socialist revolution. Stalin, together with Lenin, led the Bolshevik Party in carrying out massive propaganda and organizational work in the Soviets, trade unions, factories, and the army. The Bolshevik Party also constantly exposed the compromising and treacherous position of the petty-bourgeois parties—the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries—in order to isolate them and separate them from the masses. In a series of essays and speeches (such as "To All the Workers and Soldiers of Petrograd," "Against Scattered Demonstrations," "Local Self-Government Election Movement," "What Happened?" "Unite More Closely," etc.), Stalin sharply exposed the Mensheviks' and Socialist-Revolutionaries' position of supporting the war and imperialism, teaching the masses to recognize the lies of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries about freedom, peace, and land.

In order to formulate a new strategy under the new conditions of struggle, the Bolshevik Party convened its Sixth Congress at the end of July and the beginning of August 1917. Lenin was unable to attend the congress, but he indirectly led the work of the congress through Stalin, Sverdlov, and others. The basic issues discussed at the congress were Stalin's two reports—the summary report of the Central Committee and the report on the political situation. In these two reports, Stalin clarified the new relationship between the class forces in Russia, stipulated the tasks and strategies of the party in the struggle for the socialist revolution, and determined the policy of armed uprising.

Stalin analyzed the development of the political situation in Russia after the February Revolution, pointing out that the revolution had raised the issue of workers' control over production and distribution of products, the transfer of land to the peasants, and the transfer of power from the bourgeoisie to the working class and poor peasants. In terms of its nature, the revolution had become a proletarian revolution, he said: "The peaceful period of the revolution is over. The period of struggle and explosion has arrived." (Page 165)

At this congress, Stalin also insisted on and further developed Lenin's theory that socialism can be victorious in a single country, and criticized the dogmatic view of the socialist revolution. He pointed out that the war and economic destruction had shaken the capitalist organizational basis of the national economy, and that the Russian working class had a high degree of organization and had such a broad organization as the Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, which was already able to carry out the socialist transformation of the country's economic life. "If Russia is required to 'wait' to carry out socialist transformation until Europe 'starts' to carry out socialist transformation, it would be shameful pedantry." (Page 162) "It is very possible that Russia is the country that opens up the road to socialism." "We must abandon the outdated idea that only Europe can show us the way. There is dogmatic Marxism, and there is creative Marxism. I am in favor of the latter kind of Marxism." (Page 174)

After the Sixth Congress of the Bolshevik Party, the development of the domestic situation in Russia fully confirmed Stalin's analysis of the political situation at this congress. The Provisional Government, headed by Kerensky, intensified its terrorist measures against the Bolshevik Party; at the same time, the counter-revolutionary General Kornilov also launched a rebellion and marched towards the fortress of the revolution—Petrograd, attempting to suppress the revolutionary movement and establish a military dictatorship.

During this period, Stalin exposed the counter-revolutionary plots of the bourgeoisie and its lackeys in a series of essays (such as "Our Demands," "The Conspiracy Continues," "Foreigners and the Kornilov Conspiracy," etc.), and called on the masses to rise up and crush the counter-revolutionary conspiracy.

After the Kornilov rebellion was crushed, the development of the Russian Revolution entered a new stage—the stage of organizing the assault. By early September, the Soviets of both Petrograd and Moscow had fallen into the hands of the Bolshevik Party. At this time, Stalin, together with Lenin, bravely and confidently led the Bolshevik Party and the Russian working class to advance towards the socialist revolution. Volume 3 of "The Complete Works of Stalin" publishes some of Stalin's essays related to this stage, such as "On the Democratic Conference," "All Power to the Soviets!" "The Government of Bourgeois Dictatorship," "Who Needs a Pre-Parliament?" etc. In these essays, he called on the masses to prepare for the battle to seize power, and exposed the conspiracy of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries to weaken the growing revolutionary movement.

The conditions for an armed uprising were ripe. On October 10, 1917, the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party held a meeting and passed the resolution on armed uprising drafted by Lenin. On this day, Stalin published an article entitled "The Counter-Revolution Is Mobilizing—Prepare to Repulse It!" warning the Russian working class that the counter-revolutionary forces, headed by the Provisional Government, were preparing a new Kornilov rebellion with the active participation of the imperialists of Britain, the United States, etc. Therefore, he called on the masses to prepare to repulse it.

The Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party held an enlarged meeting again on October 16. At this meeting, the headquarters of the party leading the uprising was elected, and Stalin was responsible for presiding over it. However, the capitulators Kamenev and Zinoviev opposed the uprising again. In his speech, Stalin sharply rebuked their capitulationist position. He said: "Kamenev and Zinoviev's proposals objectively allow the counter-revolution to prepare and organize. We will retreat endlessly, causing the revolution to fail. Why shouldn't we guarantee ourselves the possibility of choosing the date and conditions of the uprising without allowing the counter-revolution to organize?" "We should unswervingly embark on the path of uprising." (Page 366)

On the first day of the uprising, October 24, Stalin published an article entitled "What Do We Need?" in the "Worker's Path" newspaper, calling on the masses to rise up and overthrow the Provisional Government immediately. The revolutionary workers and soldiers responded to the call of the Bolshevik Party and staged an armed uprising in Petrograd, arresting the members of the Provisional Government. In this way, the Russian proletariat, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and Lenin and Stalin, completed the great October Socialist Revolution and ushered in a new era in human history.

The essays, reports, and speeches contained in Volume 3 of "The Complete Works of Stalin" vividly reflect an important period in the history of the Bolshevik Party. These works are not only valuable documents for the Bolshevik Party's preparation and execution of the October Socialist Revolution, but also outstanding examples of the combination of Marxist-Leninist theory with the actual struggle of the working class. Studying these works can improve our level of theoretical thinking and encourage us to overcome any difficulties we encounter on the road to building socialism.

    介绍“斯大林全集”第三卷
    宋书声
    中共中央马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林著作编译局翻译的“斯大林全集”第三卷，已由人民出版社出版。
    “斯大林全集”第三卷包括斯大林在一九一七年三月至十月这一时期的主要论文、报告和讲演。这个时期是俄国革命发展的整个战略阶段，是伟大十月社会主义革命的准备时期。在这个时期中，布尔什维克党根据列宁制定的从资产阶级民主革命过渡到社会主义革命的英明计划，为了夺取国家政权、建立无产阶级专政，同反革命的资产阶级以及妥协的小资产阶级政党孟什维克和社会革命党人进行了极复杂极顽强的斗争。斯大林和列宁一起领导了这个伟大的斗争。
    “斯大林全集”第三卷所收集的一些著作，表明了斯大林为拥护列宁路线、反对妥协派思想和政策而进行的坚决斗争；表明了无产阶级政党在实现社会主义革命斗争中的伟大的领导作用；表明了马克思列宁主义理论同工人阶级实际斗争的密切结合。这些著作并表明了列宁、斯大林思想的伟大的动员作用和组织作用。这些著作以俄国进行胜利的社会主义革命的新经验丰富了并向前推进了马克思列宁主义理论。
    大家知道，俄国在一九一七年二月革命推翻沙皇帝制后成立的临时政府是资产阶级专政的政府。这个政府执行着反革命的政策。在这新的条件下，布尔什维克党必须有一个新的方针，才能把革命推向前进。二月革命胜利后的最初几天，列宁就在
  “远方来信”中提出了继续发展革命的任务。列宁于四月初从国外回到俄国后的头一天，又发表了著名的“四月提纲”，具体地规定了革命从第一阶段过渡到第二阶段即由无产阶级和贫苦农民夺取政权的新方针。同时，列宁还制定了从资产阶级民主革命过渡到社会主义革命的具体计划。
    斯大林坚决拥护列宁的这个社会主义革命路线。斯大林先于列宁在一九一七年三月十二日由流放地回到彼得格勒，当即团结党的力量为把资产阶级民主革命转变为社会主义革命而斗争。当时他发表了一系列的论文（如“论工兵代表苏维埃”“论战争”“论俄国革命胜利的条件”“二者必居其一”等）来阐明党对于苏维埃、战争、临时政府等问题的政策。
    斯大林在“论工兵代表苏维埃”一文中论证了工兵代表苏维埃在革命发展中的意义和作用，坚持了不信任帝国主义的临时政府的政策，把苏维埃看作保证俄国革命完全胜利的重要条件之一。他说，要继续扩大革命，必须使工人同穿上军衣的农民的联盟成为“自觉而坚强的、持久而稳固的联盟……工兵代表苏维埃也就是这种联盟的机关。”（第四页）他号召工人、农民和士兵联合到工兵代表苏维埃中。在“论俄国革命胜利的条件”一文中，斯大林指出俄国革命要获得胜利必须有下列条件：第一个条件是结束两个政权并存的局面，建立一个真正革命的政权机关，以便动员人民的一切有生力量来反对反革命，“只有全俄工兵农代表苏维埃能够成为这样的机关”；第二个条件是立即武装工人，建立“自己的、和革命利益血肉相连的工人近卫军”，因为“没有一支随时准备为革命效劳的武装力量，革命就不能胜利”（见第十四、十五页）。他号召用另一个更民主的机关来代替当时的临时政府。
    在列宁的“四月提纲”发表后，斯大林即坚决地为实现提纲中所提出的原理而奋斗。他于一九一七年四月十八日在瓦西里岛群众大会上的演说（“论临时政府”）中揭发了临时政府的反人民的政策，指出工人和农民不能支持这个资本家和地主的政府。他号召全俄所有的贫农把自己的事情掌握在自己手里，组织革命的农民委员会，“通过这些委员会把地主的土地夺取过来，有组织地自行耕种这些土地”。
    一九一七年四月二十四日举行布尔什维克党第七次代表会议，列宁在会上发挥了他先前在“四月提纲”中提出的一些原理，指出党应当采取准备社会主义革命的方针，并提出“全部政权归苏维埃”的口号。在这次代表会议上，斯大林捍卫了列宁的社会主义革命路线，并作了关于民族问题的报告。斯大林在这个报告中分析了民族压迫产生的根源，论证了布尔什维克党的民族政策，并批判了犹太工人同盟所提出的“民族文化自治”的反动口号，斯大林提出了布尔什维克党在社会主义革命中关于民族问题的如下纲领：“（甲）承认各民族有分离权；（乙）留在同一国家范围内的各民族实行区域自治；
  （丙）为少数民族制定特别的法律以保障它们的自由发展；（丁）同一国家内一切民族的无产者组成一个统一而不可分的无产阶级的集体，组成一个统一的政党。”（第五十二页）这一纲领保证了俄国各被压迫民族对无产阶级革命的同情和支持，并奠立了十月社会主义革命胜利后各民族友好团结的基础。
    第七次代表会议以后，布尔什维克党根据列宁和斯大林所制定的纲领，为了从资产阶级民主革命转变为社会主义革命，展开了巨大的争取群众的工作。斯大林和列宁一起，领导布尔什维克党在苏维埃、工会、工厂、军队里进行了巨大的宣传鼓动工作和组织工作。布尔什维克党并不断揭露小资产阶级的政党——孟什维克和社会革命党人的妥协、叛卖立场，借以孤立他们，使他们同群众隔离。斯大林在一系列论文和讲演（如“告彼得格勒全体劳动者，全体工人和士兵书”“反对分散的游行示威”“地方自治机关选举运动”“发生了什么事情？”
  “更紧密地团结起来”等）中尖锐地揭露了孟什维克和社会革命党人拥护战争和帝国主义的立场，教导群众认清孟什维克和社会革命党人关于自由、和平、土地所作的谎言。
    为了在新的斗争条件下制定新的策略，一九一七年七月底和八月初布尔什维克党召开了第六次代表大会。列宁未能出席这次大会，他通过斯大林、斯维尔德洛夫等间接地领导了大会的工作。大会所讨论的基本问题是斯大林所作的两个报告——中央委员会的总结报告和关于政治形势的报告。斯大林在这两个报告中阐明了俄国阶级力量的新的对比关系，规定了党在争取社会主义革命斗争中的任务和策略，确定了武装起义的方针。
    斯大林分析了二月革命后俄国政治形势的发展情况，指出革命已提出了工人监督生产和产品分配、土地转归农民、政权从资产阶级手中转归工人阶级和贫农的问题。就性质来说，革命已成为无产阶级的革命，他说：“革命的和平时期已经结束。搏斗和爆发的时期已经来到。”（一六五页）
    斯大林在这次大会上还坚持了和进一步发展了列宁关于社会主义在单独一国内可以胜利的学说，批判了对社会主义革命的教条主义的观点。他指出，战争和经济的破坏已经动摇了国民经济的资本主义组织基础，俄国工人阶级具有高度的组织性并且有工兵代表苏维埃这种广泛的组织，它已能够对国家的经济生活进行社会主义的改造，“如果要求俄国在欧洲没有‘开始’实行社会主义改造以前‘暂缓’实行社会主义改造，那就是可耻的迂腐之见了。”（第一六二页）“很有可能，俄国正是开辟社会主义道路的国家。”“必须抛弃那种认为只有欧洲才能给我们指示道路的陈腐观念。有教条式的马克思主义，也有创造性的马克思主义。我是主张后一种马克思主义的。”（第一七四页）
    布尔什维克党第六次代表大会以后，俄国国内形势的发展完全证实了斯大林在这次大会上对政治形势的分析。以克伦斯基为首的临时政府对布尔什维克党加紧施行恐怖手段；同时，反革命的科尔尼洛夫将军也举行叛乱，向革命的堡垒——彼得格勒进军，企图镇压革命运动，成立武人独裁政府。
    在这个期间，斯大林在一系列的论文（如“我们的要求”“阴谋在继续”“外国人和科尔尼洛夫阴谋”等）中揭露了资产阶级及其走狗的反革命诡计，并号召人民群众起来粉碎反革命的阴谋。
    科尔尼洛夫叛乱被消灭以后，俄国革命的发展进入了一个新的阶段——组织冲锋的阶段。九月初彼得格勒和莫斯科两市的苏维埃都已落在布尔什维克党手中。这时斯大林和列宁一起，勇敢而有信心地领导布尔什维克党和俄国工人阶级向社会主义革命前进。“斯大林全集”第三卷刊载了斯大林有关这一阶段的一些论文，如“论民主会议”“全部政权归苏维埃！”“资产阶级专政的政府”“谁需要预备国会？”等。他在这些论文中号召群众进行夺取政权的战斗准备，并揭露孟什维克和社会革命党人企图削弱日益增长的革命运动的阴谋。
    武装起义的条件成熟了。一九一七年十月十日布尔什维克党中央举行会议，通过了列宁所起草的关于武装起义的决议。这一天斯大林发表了“反革命正在动员起来，——准备反击吧！”一文，警告俄国工人阶级说，以临时政府为首的反革命势力在英、美等帝国主义者积极参加之下又在准备新的科尔尼洛夫叛乱，因此，他号召人民群众准备反击。
    布尔什维克党中央十月十六日又举行扩大会议。在这次会议上选出了党领导起义的总部，由斯大林负责主持。但是投降主义者加米湼夫和季诺维也夫又反对起义。斯大林在发言中尖锐地斥责了他们的投降主义立场。他说：“加米湼夫和季诺维也夫的建议客观上是让反革命有可能准备和组织起来。我们将无止境地退却，使革命遭到失败。为什么我们不应该保证自己有可能选择起义的日期和条件而不让反革命组织起来呢？”“我们应该坚定不移地走上起义的道路。”（第三六六页）
    在起义的第一天，十月二十四日，斯大林在“工人之路报”上发表了“我们需要什么？”一文，号召群众起来立即推翻临时政府。革命的工人和士兵响应布尔什维克党的号召，在彼得格勒举行了武装起义，逮捕了临时政府人员。这样，俄国无产阶级在布尔什维克党和列宁、斯大林的领导下，就完成了伟大十月社会主义革命，开创了人类历史上的新纪元。
      “斯大林全集”第三卷所载的一些论文、报告和讲演生动地反映了布尔什维克党历史上的一个重要时期。这些著作不仅是布尔什维克党准备和进行十月社会主义革命的珍贵文献，而且是马克思列宁主义理论同工人阶级实际斗争相结合的卓越榜样。研究这些著作，可以提高我们的理论思想水平，鼓舞我们去克服我们在建设社会主义的道路上所遇到的任何困难。
