First of all, I would like to extend my highest respect to the Party and Chairman Mao, and my heartfelt thanks to the dear comrades of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Chinese Dramatists Association. Today's commemorative meeting is not only an honor for me and Mr. Zhou Xinfang personally, but also the greatest honor for all Chinese opera workers.

Mr. Ouyang's speech just now gave me great encouragement. Mr. Ouyang is absolutely right, my small achievements in stage life are not based on any special tricks, but simply "the accumulation of labor."

I started learning opera after the庚子 year of the Guangxu period in the late Qing Dynasty. The operas I learned were mainly 青衣正工戏, which focused on singing. The performances of this type of opera at that time did not pay attention to body movements and expressions, and the audience at that time also focused on listening rather than watching.

After the Xinhai Revolution, the audience's demands for opera art also increased. I initially felt that this kind of 青衣 opera that only focused on singing could no longer meet the audience's demands, so in addition to 青衣, I also learned two excerpts from "Hongni Pass," "Fanjiang Pass," and "Mukezhai," which focused on body movements, expressions, and martial arts, in order to broaden and enrich my repertoire. As expected, these operas were more popular than 青衣 operas after they were performed.

Also, around the end of the Qing Dynasty and the beginning of the Republic of China, the social educational role of drama gradually became clear, and spoken drama began to become active. I felt the responsibility of actors to society, so I successively rehearsed "Nie Hai Bo Lan" (Waves in a Sinful Sea), "Yi Lü Ma" (A Strand of Hemp), "Deng Xia Gu," "Tong Nü Zhan She" (Girl Slaying a Snake), and other modern dramas with modern stories as themes. The content reflected the unreasonable social phenomena of women being oppressed and lack of freedom of marriage, as well as social demands for breaking superstitions. From today's perspective, the content and form of these scripts have many shortcomings, but they played some positive roles in the society at that time.

Afterward, I learned Kunqu opera from senior teachers and became very interested in Kunqu opera. Because Kunqu opera is a classical opera that emphasizes both singing and dancing and has a high degree of artistry, Peking opera is most influenced by it. After learning Kunqu opera, my performing skills underwent a very significant change.

From performing 青衣, 闺门旦, I progressed to performing 贴旦, 刀马旦, rehearsing modern dramas, and learning Kunqu opera. In these stages, my performing arts became much richer than before. Based on these foundations, I boldly carried out some new attempts. In the dance part, there were the sword dance in "Farewell My Concubine," the dust-拂尘 dance in "Shangyuan Lady," the sleeve dance in "Magu Presents Longevity," the盘 dance in "Tai Zhen Wai Zhuan," the feather dance in "Xi Shi," the silk dance in "Celestial Maiden Scattering Flowers," the flower-sickle dance in "Chang'e Flying to the Moon," the firefly-catching dance in "A Thousand Gold for a Smile," and the clam-stabbing dance in "Lian Jin Feng," etc. Among them, the sword dance in "Farewell My Concubine" is a refinement and transformation of the sword dance in the Peking opera excerpts from "Hongmen Banquet" and "Heroes' Assembly," as well as the mace dance in "Selling Horses and Using Mace," while also absorbing the swordplay techniques from Chinese martial arts. However, the dances of the original three excerpts of "Hongmen Banquet" and so on only had percussion accompaniment, while the sword dance in "Farewell My Concubine" partly added singing and partly coordinated with orchestral accompaniment. The sleeve dance in "Magu Presents Longevity" is based on my understanding of the ancient idiom "long sleeves are good at dancing," which implied that there was an ancient dance mainly based on sleeves, and it was based on the sleeve movements of旦角 roles and the research on a type of sleeve dance. The silk dance of "Celestial Maiden Scattering Flowers" was created based on the image of the "Celestial Maiden Scattering Flowers" in ancient paintings. The characteristic of the celestial maiden's clothing is two windbands, showing her riding the wind, so I thought of using these two windbands to strengthen the dance of the movements and created the silk dance of Celestial Maiden Scattering Flowers. The clothing part is mostly taken from the costumes of women in many ancient paintings, carvings, sculptures, and other artworks. Because it must be suitable for the performing conditions on the stage, the character of the characters, and the harmony of patterns and colors, it must be appropriately tailored; especially the design of the hair buns on the head, which was completed after several experiments and reforms.

After the above series of artistic reforms and stage practices were approved by the audience, I began to perform abroad. The purpose of my going abroad was, on the one hand, to introduce Chinese opera to foreign countries, and on the other hand, to observe and absorb foreign drama art to enrich our national art.

What is most unforgettable is in 1935, I accepted the invitation of the Soviet Union's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries to visit and perform in the Soviet Union. When I first saw the great socialist country, its new appearance left me with an indelible impression. I performed in the two cities of Moscow and Leningrad for three weeks and received great encouragement from the broad masses of the Soviet people. I met the Soviet drama masters Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko, and in addition to watching the famous plays they directed, I also held座谈 more than once, exchanging experiences in drama art with each other very cordially. After they watched my plays, they had this evaluation of the performing methods of Chinese opera: saying that the performing rules of Chinese opera are "free movements with rules." This sentence made me more deeply understand the characteristics of our national opera art. This visit to the Soviet Union not only brought me significant gains in art, but also greatly influenced my thinking.

After the "September 18th" Incident, Japanese imperialism carried out a frenzied invasion of China. At that time, with incomparable anger, I compiled and performed "Resisting the Jin Soldiers" and "Life and Death Regret." These two plays had the theme of resisting aggression and inspiring people. They were publicly performed in various places and received enthusiastic support from the audience, which can reflect the rise of national consciousness among the people at that time. The education and encouragement that the people gave me were extremely profound.

After the nationwide liberation, I participated in political activities and toured around to perform in various places, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and several industrial areas such as Shijiazhuang, Wuxi, and eight cities in the Northeast. I also participated in the groundbreaking ceremony of the three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel, and at the same time, I gloriously participated in the work of going to North Korea to慰问 the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. Later, I went to South China to慰问 the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In these performance activities, worker, peasant, and soldier audiences accounted for the largest proportion. I accepted the unforgettable inspiration and help they gave me, which improved my performance methods, especially in the portrayal and analysis of character and class relations, and strengthened my determination to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

In the years from 1952 to the beginning of 1953, I gloriously participated in the World People's Peace Congress held in Vienna, which made me personally see the strength of the peace camp and encouraged my confidence in fighting to defend world peace.

In the old society, I worked hard to perform operas for decades. Although I had some achievements in art, what exactly was the object of my service? It was vague. After liberation, I studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and realized that literature and art should first serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. After clarifying this direction, I felt that my artistic life had found its true home. Although it has only been more than five years since the liberation of mainland China, five years is not a long time, but it is the most valuable stage in my sixty years of life. In this stage, I have achieved unprecedented development in both politics and art. However, in these five years, although I have made some efforts in opera art practice, there are still many things that should be done but have not been done. For example, in the reform of opera, my contribution is not enough. I am currently shooting a 彩色 documentary film, and I hope that through this film, I can make some contributions to the broad masses of the people and to the young generation of our opera workers. The third and fourth collections of my "Forty Years of Stage Life" should also be written as soon as possible for the reference of comrades engaged in opera work. I also want to perform in places I have never been to, and learn from various brother opera genres to exchange experiences. I am willing to help the new forces in many ways. I hope that my work can make a small contribution to socialist cultural construction. I am also determined to engage in the study of dialectical materialism and historical materialism. I deeply realize that as a people's literary and art worker, if you do not grasp the Marxist-Leninist worldview, it is difficult to imagine talking about the artistic creation of socialist realism.

Summarizing my fifty years of artistic practice, I can only tell the young opera comrades the following few words: Love your work, honestly engage in learning, work hard in artistic practice, constantly work, constantly exercise, and constantly create; constantly humbly accept mass opinions, and strictly conduct self-criticism; contribute everything for the people and for the brilliant and beautiful future of the motherland!

    为着人民，为着祖国美好的未来，贡献出我们的一切
    ——在梅兰芳周信芳舞台生活五十年纪念会上的答词摘要
    梅兰芳
    我今天首先要向党和毛主席致最崇高的敬礼，并向中华人民共和国文化部、中国文学艺术界联合会、中国戏剧家协会亲爱的同志们致衷心的谢意。今天这个纪念会，不独是我个人和周信芳先生的光荣，也是我们全中国戏曲工作者最大的光荣。
    刚才欧阳先生的发言，给了我很大的鼓舞。欧阳先生说得一点不错，我在舞台生活上的这样一些微小成就，并不是依靠什么特别窍门得来的，而只是“劳动的积累”。
    我开始学戏，是在满清末期光绪庚子以后，学的戏都是以唱工为主的青衣正工戏。这类戏在当时的演法，是不注重身段、表情的，当时观众对这类戏的要求，也着重听而不着重看。
    辛亥革命以后，观众对戏曲艺术的要求也提高了，我初步地感觉到，这种专重唱工的青衣戏，已经不能满足观众要求，所以就在青衣之外，兼学了二本“虹霓关”、“樊江关”、“穆柯寨”这些偏重身段、表情和武工的戏，使戏路宽广丰富一些。果然这些戏演出以后，比青衣戏更受欢迎。
    也就在清末民初的时候，戏剧的社会教育作用逐渐明确，话剧已开始活跃起来。我感到了演员对社会的责任，就先后排演了以现代故事为题材的“孽海波澜”、“一缕麻”、“邓霞姑”、“童女斩蛇”等时装戏，内容是反映妇女受压迫、婚姻不自由等不合理社会现象和破除迷信的社会要求。从今天看来，这些剧本的内容和形式是有很多缺点的，但在当时社会里，却起了一些好的作用。
    随后我又从前辈先生们学习昆曲，对昆曲发生了很大兴趣。因为昆曲是一种歌舞并重、具有高度艺术性的古典戏曲，京剧受它的影响最大。学习了昆曲以后，我的表演技术，就有了很显著的变化。
    我从演青衣、闺门旦进展到演贴旦、刀马旦，排演时装戏，学习昆曲这几个时期，在表演艺术上，比以前已经丰富得多了。我就在这些基础上，大胆进行了一些新的尝试。在舞蹈部分，有“霸王别姬”里的剑舞，“上元夫人”里的拂尘舞，“麻姑献寿”里的袖舞，“太真外传”里的盘舞，“西施”里的羽舞，“天女散花”里的绸舞，“嫦娥奔月”里的花镰舞，“千金一笑”里的扑萤舞，“廉锦枫”里的刺蚌舞等。这里面“霸王别姬”里的剑舞，是把京剧“鸿门宴”和“群英会”的舞剑，还有“卖马当锏”的舞锏的舞蹈加以提炼变化，同时吸取国术中的剑法汇合编制而成的。不过，“鸿门宴”等三个戏的舞蹈，原只有打击乐器的伴奏，“霸王别姬”里的剑舞，却是一部分加入了歌唱，另一部分又配合了管弦乐的伴奏的。“麻姑献寿”里的袖舞，是我从古代的“长袖善舞”这句成语，体会出古代有一种以袖子为主的舞蹈，而根据旦角的水袖动作研究出的一种袖舞。“天女散花”的绸舞，是根据古代绘画“天女散花图”的形象创造出的。天女服装上的特征是两条风带，显示着御风而行，我就想到可以利用这两条风带来加强动作的舞蹈性，创造了天女散花的绸舞。服装部分，大都取材于许多古代绘画、雕刻、塑像等等美术品上的妇女的装束，因为要适合于舞台上表演的条件、人物的性格、图案色彩的调和，就必须加以适当的剪裁；特别是头上发髻的设计，是经过了若干次的试验和改革，才完成今天的样子的。
    上面一系列的艺术改革和舞台实践，得到观众的批准之后，我就开始了出国演出。我出去的目的，一方面是想把中国的戏曲介绍到国外，一方面也是想借此观摩吸收外国戏剧艺术来丰富我们的民族艺术。
    最难忘的是一九三五年，我接受了苏联对外文化协会的邀请，去苏联进行访问演出。我初次看到伟大的社会主义国家，它的新面貌给我留下了不可磨灭的印象。我在莫斯科和列宁格勒两个城市演出了三个星期，受到了苏联广大人民的极大鼓励。我见到了苏联戏剧大师斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和聂米洛维奇—丹钦科两位老先生，除了观摩他们所导演的名剧以外，还不止一次地举行了座谈，彼此极其亲切地交换了戏剧艺术方面的经验。他们看了我的戏以后，对中国戏曲的表演方法，有过这样的评价：说中国戏曲的表演法则是“有规则的自由动作”。这句话使我更深刻地认识了我们民族戏曲艺术的特征。我这次访苏，不但在艺术上得到了重大的收获，同时在思想上也受到极大的影响。
    “九一八”事变后，日本帝国主义对中国进行了疯狂的侵略，我当时以无比愤怒的心情编演了“抗金兵”和“生死恨”两个戏。这两个戏，是以反抗侵略、鼓舞人心为主题的，在各地公演，得到观众的热烈支持，可以反映出当时人民民族意识的高涨，人民给我的教育和鼓舞是极其深刻的。
    全国解放以后，我参加了政治活动，并在各地巡回演出，到过北京、天津、上海、武汉和几个工业区如石家庄、无锡及东北八个城市，又参加了鞍钢三大工程的开工典礼，同时，还光荣地参加了赴朝慰问中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的工作，后来，又到华南慰问中国人民解放军。在这些演出活动中，工农兵观众占了最大的比重。我接受了他们给我的永不能忘的启发和帮助，使我在表演方法上，特别是在人物性格和阶级关系的刻划和分析上，提高了一步，加强了我为工农兵服务的决心。
    一九五二年到一九五三年的岁尾年初，我光荣地参加了在维也纳召开的世界人民和平大会，使我亲眼看到和平阵营力量的强大，鼓舞了我为保卫世界和平而斗争的信心。
    在旧社会里，我辛辛苦苦地演了几十年的戏，虽然在艺术上有过一些成就，但服务的对象究竟是什么？却是模糊的。解放以后，我学习了毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，才懂得了文艺应该首先为工农兵服务的道理。明确了这个方向，我觉得自己的艺术生命才找到了真正的归宿。从我国大陆解放到今天，虽然只有五年多，五年多的时间不能算长，可是在我六十年的生命史中却是最宝贵的一个阶段。在这个阶段里，无论在政治上、艺术上，我都得到了前所未有的发展。不过，在这五年当中，我在戏曲艺术实践上虽然做了一些努力，但应该做而没有做的事情还是很多，比如在戏曲改革方面，自己的贡献就是很不够的。目前我正在拍摄五彩纪录电影，我希望通过这部电影，对广大的人民，对我们戏曲工作者的青年一代，能有一些贡献。我的“舞台生活四十年”三、四等集，也当抓紧时间写出，以供从事戏曲工作的同志参考。我还要到我所没有到过的地方演出，向各兄弟剧种作交流经验的学习。对新生力量，我愿从多方面来予以帮助。我希望我的工作对社会主义文化建设能有微末的贡献。我还决心从事于辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的学习。我深深体会到，作为一个人民的文艺工作者，如不掌握马克思列宁主义的世界观，空谈社会主义现实主义的艺术创造，那是难以想像的。
    综合我五十年来的艺术实践，我能够告诉各位青年戏曲工作同志的，只有下面这几句话：热爱你的工作，老老实实地从事学习，努力艺术实践，不断地劳动，不断地锻炼，不断地创造；不断地虚心接受群众意见，严格进行自我批评；为着人民，为着祖国灿烂美好的未来，贡献出我们的一切！
