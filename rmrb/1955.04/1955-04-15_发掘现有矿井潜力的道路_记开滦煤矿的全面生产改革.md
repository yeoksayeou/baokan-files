    The Path to Exploring the Potential of Existing Mines
    —A Record of Kailuan Coal Mine's Comprehensive Production Reform

    I.

    Kailuan Coal Mine is one of the largest and oldest mines in China. It was built more than half a century ago according to the backward technical standards of the time, and its production technology typically reflects the characteristics of a colonial industry. For example, geological surveying is the "eyes of coal mine production" and is a basic condition for ensuring rational, economical, and safe coal mine production. However, due to the predatory nature of foreign capital's mining activities in Kailuan, despite the complexity of the Kailuan coalfield's geological conditions, no geological surveying work was established for more than fifty years, which has brought the greatest disasters to Kailuan Coal Mine's production in recent years. The backwardness of geological surveying has affected correct tunneling, and the backwardness of tunneling has affected mining, resulting in a long-term imbalance in the three basic links of Kailuan Coal Mine's production, which has left production in a state of constant tension, rush jobs, and passivity. Operations are irregular, balanced production and safe production are not guaranteed, and the waste of coal due to chaotic mining cannot be overcome.

    The old mechanical equipment and manual labor in Kailuan Coal Mine are strangely intertwined, with the aim of maximizing the physical labor of miners. For example, the underground main roadway transport uses high-speed electric locomotives, but the coal mining face is entirely backward manual labor. The wellhead main roadway hoists coal with high-speed multi-layer cages, but loading the coal cars into the cages is done manually. When the machine hoists the coal to the wellhead, manpower is needed to quickly push the 550-kilogram coal car across the overpass to the machine coal preparation plant in one minute. This imbalance in mechanical equipment forces the workers of Kailuan Coal Mine to work at maximum intensity all day long, racing against the machines in a tense manner.

    Kailuan Coal Mine, with its luxurious ground buildings, maintains the most backward and cruel physical labor underground. There are dozens of miles of underground roadways, and many mules and horses are still used for transportation, with more than ten kilometers even using the most backward manual pushcarts. These large numbers of mules and horses occupy a large amount of fresh air for the underground workers, because the amount of air required by one mule or horse is three to four times that of a worker. Fresh air is more important than anything else to the miners working hundreds of meters underground. If the air does not circulate, the harmful gases emitted from the coal seam will condense and cause terrible explosions. However, in the past, foreign capitalists completely disregarded the lives and deaths of the workers, and the ventilation work was extremely backward. The amount of air per minute for each worker in the Kailuan mine was less than one cubic meter. Due to poor ventilation, many tragic methane explosions have occurred in history.

    Geology, surveying, tunneling, transportation, and ventilation are several key links in coal mine production, and they are interconnected and mutually influential. The weakness and disconnection of these links cannot but bring fatal harm to the entire mine's production.

    The organizational structure of Kailuan Coal Mine, which is linked to production, is also abnormally large and unreasonable. Organizational structures overlap, and each workshop (mining area) of the coal mine has a full set of economic staff: accountants, statisticians, and materials personnel. The result of having too many people is cumbersome procedures, unclear responsibilities, and low efficiency. According to Soviet experts, the number of employees in Kailuan Coal Mine exceeds that of Soviet coal mines with the same output by two to three times.

    The above-mentioned backward conditions of Kailuan Coal Mine did not have a significant impact on production in the early days of liberation because the production tasks were not heavy. However, in recent years, as production tasks have become increasingly heavy, the contradictions have become acute, leading to a poor situation of high costs, large waste, low efficiency (the lowest among coal mines in the country), and many accidents in the past two years.

    II.

    How can we completely reverse the passive situation of production and tap the huge potential? In the years after liberation, Kailuan Coal Mine has been constantly exploring the correct path in this regard. They have carried out some production reforms and organizational reforms, but they have not been very effective because two fundamental problems have not been solved for a long time: the overall arrangement of industrial production and the systematic study of Soviet experience. Coal mine production, like other modern industrial mass production, is a closely linked whole in all aspects. At the same time, due to the different production objects, it has special laws different from other industrial production. To improve the level of coal mine production and continuously tap the potential inside the mine, it is necessary to recognize its internal connections, grasp its special laws, and then make comprehensive and planned arrangements according to these laws, and establish a solid and normal production order. Only on this basis can we continuously use the internal potential of the enterprise to lead the mine's production to prosperity.

    In 1952, Kailuan Coal Mine vigorously reformed the coal mining methods and achieved certain results. At that time, it was thought that this was almost enough. But soon after, the contradiction of backward tunneling was discovered. Reforming the coal mining methods alone could not solve the problem, so tunneling was reformed from 1953. From 1953 to the first half of 1954, the tunneling footage was greatly accelerated, with the daily footage increasing from 394 meters to 857 meters. People had just breathed a sigh of relief when problems arose again: the amount of coal obtained underground decreased instead. Later, after inspection, it was found that the tunneling work was blind due to the lack of geological surveying guidance. Many of the tunnels dug were waste tunnels that could not be used for mining, resulting in extremely large waste. Reforming coal mining and tunneling alone could not solve the problem, so they turned back to reforming geological surveying. In the process of these reforms, the weaknesses in transportation, ventilation, and mechanization continued to form new threats, affecting production. In particular, the large and unreasonable organizational structure made it impossible for the leadership to flexibly and effectively direct production, and it was impossible to establish the production area responsibility system necessary for managing modern production, and many tasks could not be implemented. In short, it has never worked to manage modern large-scale production by treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts. The result of only partial reforms without overall consideration is that it not only fails to solve the imbalance of each link, but also makes the imbalance more prominent, and the work becomes more hectic and passive.

    After the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, the Ministry of Fuel Industry, in accordance with the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session's resolution, reviewed the errors of blindly pursuing large-scale and rapid advancement in the construction of Northeast coal mines in the past, neglecting the work of restoring and rebuilding old mines, and criticized the idea of not attaching importance to giving play to the potential of the mines. In order to find a way to give play to the potential of the mines, Chen Yu, Minister of Fuel Industry, and the Soviet coal mine expert group went to Kailuan Coal Mine in August last year. They deeply studied the situation and problems of Kailuan Coal Mine and clearly realized that systematically studying the experience of Soviet coal mine production and carrying out comprehensive production reform is the specific path to tap the potential of existing mines. On August 24, the Kailuan Coal Mine Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of all Party member cadres in the mine, and reviewed the work of the past two years and more in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. Minister Chen Yu, based on the results of the research, put forward a comprehensive production reform plan at the meeting, requiring Kailuan Coal Mine to carry out comprehensive reforms in eight aspects, including mine reconstruction, geology, surveying, tunneling, transportation, ventilation, labor organization, and administrative institutions, in order to fundamentally change the legacy of colonial industry. Soviet experts also put forward specific suggestions for comprehensive production reform. This comprehensive production reform is essentially a comprehensive and systematic study of Soviet experience. At the meeting, everyone criticized the past mistake of not being resolute enough in learning from Soviet experience, and raised the issue of learning from Soviet experience and implementing expert suggestions to the height of Party spirit.

    The comprehensive production reform plan was warmly welcomed by the cadres and workers of Kailuan Coal Mine. The unanimous response was: "In the past, we were distressed because we didn't know where to start in our work. Now the direction is clear, and we know what to do." Immediately after the meeting, the cadres and workers of Kailuan Coal Mine enthusiastically and vigorously began this historically significant transformation work.

    III.

    Kailuan Coal Mine's comprehensive production reform was fully launched from September last year. The above eight aspects can be summarized into two basic aspects: production technology reform and organizational structure reform. In the production technology reform, they paid special attention to strengthening the basic work of coal mine production—geology, surveying, and mining. They transferred technical cadres, established and reorganized mine geological surveying institutions and many water surveying stations, and sorted out the old geological data, initially connecting the three links of geology, surveying, and mining. Geological surveying began to play a guiding and supervisory role in production, and dozens of incidents of no coal were found. Implementing rational mechanization and improving the working conditions of employees are also important parts of the production technology reform, such as canceling the use of mules and horses for underground transportation and replacing them with electric locomotive transportation, rebuilding the manual pushcart overpass into automatic sliding, and improving underground ventilation. In order to adapt to the growth of production mechanization, they also launched a large-scale program to train technical workers.

    The reform of the administrative management structure is the main key to the comprehensive production reform. Because only when the leading organization is first soundly established can the smooth progress and consolidation of the production reform be guaranteed. They first reformed the organizational structures of the coal mining areas and tunneling areas according to the principle of production area management, and strengthened the leadership of on-site production. The overlapping organizations in the Kailuan Coal Mine General Management Office and various mines and departments were also merged, 109 sections were canceled, and a chief engineer's office was established to strengthen technical leadership. After the organizational reform, many cadres can be drawn out, business procedures are simplified, and work efficiency is improved. While reorganizing the organizational structure, reforms were also carried out in labor organization and wage forms. Before the production reform last year, Kailuan Coal Mine also requested an increase of 6,000 people. After preliminary adjustments, not only was there no increase, but about 4,000 people could be drawn out. The labor efficiency of the entire mine has increased compared to the past. However, the reorganization of labor organizations is still not thorough enough and is currently continuing.

    In the production reform, according to the principle of small investment and large effect, some mines are being rebuilt and restored in a planned and step-by-step manner to fully exploit their potential. The Majiagou Mine, which was closed by imperialists eighteen years ago to suppress the workers' strike struggle, began to drain the accumulated water underground on December 1st last year and officially started restoration. After the partial reconstruction of a certain well in Tangshan Mine, it will be able to produce 600,000 to 700,000 tons more coal each year. After a partial reconstruction of Linxi Mine, it will also increase production by about 500,000 tons per year.

    The comprehensive production reform has brought vitality to this ancient mine. After the full implementation of the reform plan, the output of the entire mining area will increase to twice that of 1953 by 1957, and the appearance of the mining area will be completely new. The facts of the past few months have shown that the policy of carrying out comprehensive production reform of old mines is completely correct and necessary.

    However, comprehensive production reform is an extremely complex organizational work, and there must be a good arrangement of leadership strength. In this regard, Kailuan Coal Mine also has great shortcomings. The combination of production reform and current production is not good, resulting in paying attention to one thing and losing sight of the other, which not only affects the completion of production tasks, but also delays the progress of reform work. Many reform works have not been done deeply and thoroughly enough, the effect is not obvious enough, and the passive situation of production has not been reversed. They should work hard to correct these shortcomings and unswervingly carry out the comprehensive production reform work to the end.

    发掘现有矿井潜力的道路
    ——记开滦煤矿的全面生产改革
    季音
    一
    开滦煤矿是我国规模最大、历史最久的矿山之一，它是远在半世纪以前按照当时落后的技术水平建设起来的，在生产技术上典型地表现了殖民地工业的特点。例如，地质测量工作本来是“煤矿生产的眼睛”，是保证煤矿生产合理、经济和安全的基本条件。但由于外国资本对开滦采矿事业的掠夺性质，尽管开滦煤田的地质情况是多么复杂，五十多年中却始终没有建立起地质测量工作，几年来它给开滦煤矿的生产带来了最大的灾害。由于地质测量工作落后，影响了正确的掘进，掘进落后又影响回采，造成了开滦煤矿生产中三个基本环节的长期不平衡，使生产经常处于紧张的突击和被动状态，作业不正规，均衡生产和安全生产没有保障，乱采乱掘，大量丢煤的浪费现象不能克服。
    开滦煤矿的旧有机械设备和人力劳动都奇怪地交错着，目的是为了最大限度地加强矿工的体力劳动。例如，井下大巷运输是高速度的电车，但采煤工作面上却全部是落后的人力劳动。井口大巷提升煤的是高速度的多层罐笼，但是把煤车装进罐的却是人工。当机器把煤提升到井口，却又要人力用一分钟的时间把五百五十公斤重的煤车飞速地推过天桥，送到机器选煤场。这种机械设备的不平衡，迫使开滦煤矿的工人们不得不整日以最大强度来劳动，紧张地同机器赛跑。
    有着豪华的地面建筑物的开滦煤矿，井下却保持着最落后而残忍的体力劳动。井下有数十里巷道，还依靠许多匹骡马在担任运输工作，有十余公里甚至还采用最落后的人力推车。这大批骡马占用了井下工人们大量的新鲜空气，因为一匹骡马所需的风量等于一个工人的三至四倍。新鲜空气对于在数百公尺地下劳动着的矿工们，是比什么都重要的，如果空气不流通，煤层中散发出来的有害气体就会凝聚起来，酿成可怕的爆炸。但过去外国资本家完全不顾工人的死活，通风工作极为落后，开滦井下每个工人每分钟的风量不到一立方公尺。由于通风不良，历史上曾发生过许多次瓦斯爆炸的惨剧。
    地质、测量、掘进、运输、通风，这是煤矿生产中具有决定意义的几个环节，它们都是互相联系相互影响的。这些环节的薄弱和相互脱节，就不能不给整个矿井生产带来致命的危害。
    同生产相联系的开滦煤矿的组织机构，也异常庞大和不合理。组织机构重叠，煤矿的每一车间
  （采煤区）都拥有全套经济工作人员，会计、统计、材料人员。人多的结果是手续繁琐，职责不明，效率低落。据苏联专家计算，开滦煤矿职工人数，超过苏联同样产量的煤矿二倍到三倍。
    开滦煤矿上述这些落后状况，在解放初期，由于生产任务不重，对生产的影响还不显著。但是这几年来生产任务日益加重，矛盾就尖锐起来，近二年中使它一直陷于成本高、浪费大，效率低（在全国煤矿中最低），事故多的恶劣局面。
    二
    怎样才能彻底扭转生产的被动局面，把巨大的潜力挖掘出来？开滦煤矿在解放后的几年中，曾不断探索过这方面的正确道路。他们曾进行过一些生产改革和组织改革，但都效果不大，原因是对两个根本问题长期没有解决，即工业生产的全面安排问题和系统学习苏联经验问题。煤矿生产如同其他现代工业的大生产一样，它是一个各方面紧密联系的整体，同时由于生产对象的不同，它又具有着不同于其他工业生产的特殊规律，要提高煤矿生产水平，不断发掘矿山内部的潜力，就必须认识它的内部联系，掌握它的这种特殊规律，然后按照这种规律，作全面有计划的安排，建立起巩固、正常的生产秩序。只有在这个基础上，才能不断利用企业内部潜力，把矿山生产引向繁荣。
    一九五二年，开滦煤矿曾大力改革了采煤方法，收到一定效果，当时以为这样就差不多了。但过不多久，又发现了掘进落后的矛盾，单单改革采煤方法不能解决问题，于是从一九五三年起又改革掘进。一九五三年到一九五四年上半年，掘进进尺大大加速了，每天进尺从三九四公尺提高到八五七公尺，人们刚松了一口气，却紧接着又出了问题：井下获得煤量反而减少，后来一检查，才发现掘进由于没有地质测量的指导，工作盲目，许多掘进的巷子都是不能采煤的废巷，反而造成了极大的浪费，仅仅改革采煤和掘进也不能解决问题，于是又回头来改革地质测量。而在这些改革过程中，运输、通风、机械化等方面的弱点又不断形成新的威胁，影响着生产，尤其是组织机构的庞大和不合理，更使得领导上不能灵活有效地指挥生产，不能建立管理近代生产所必需的生产区域责任制，许多工作贯彻不下去。总之，用头痛医头，脚痛医脚的方法来管理近代化的大生产，几年来始终行不通。没有通盘的考虑而只是局部地改革的结果，不但解决不了各个环节的不平衡问题，反而使得不平衡更加突出，工作也更加忙乱和被动。
    党的四中全会以后，燃料工业部根据四中全会决议的精神，检查了过去东北煤矿建设中贪大喜功、盲目冒进、忽视旧矿恢复改建工作的错误，批判了不重视发挥矿井潜力的思想。为了找出发挥矿井潜力的道路，燃料工业部部长陈郁和苏联煤矿专家小组，于去年八月到了开滦煤矿，他们深刻地研究了开滦煤矿的情况和问题，明确认识了系统学习苏联煤矿生产的经验，进行全面的生产改革，是发掘现有矿井潜力的具体道路。就在八月二十四日，中共开滦煤矿委员会召开了全矿党员干部会议，以批评和自我批评的精神，检查了过去二年多来的工作，陈郁部长根据研究的结果，在会议上提出了全面生产改革的方案，要求开滦煤矿在矿井改建、地质、测量、掘进、运输、通风、劳动组织及行政机构等八个方面进行全面的改革，从根本上改变殖民地工业的遗迹。苏联专家也提出了全面生产改革的具体建议。这个全面的生产改革，实质上也就是全面地系统地学习苏联经验。会议上大家批判了过去学习苏联经验不够坚决的错误，把学习苏联经验和贯彻专家建议问题，提到了党性原则的高度。
    全面生产改革的方案，得到了开滦煤矿干部和职工们的热烈欢迎，大家一致的反应是：“过去工作中苦于不知从那里做起，现在方向明确了，知道应当怎样做了。”就在会议结束后，开滦煤矿的干部和职工们，就热情振奋地开始了这项具有历史意义的改造工作。
    三
    开滦煤矿的全面生产改革，从去年九月份起就全面展开，把上述八个方面归纳起来，基本上是两个方面，即生产技术改革和组织机构改革。在生产技术改革中他们特别重视煤矿生产的基本工作——地质、测量和采掘的加强，抽调技术干部，建立和整顿了矿井地质测量机构和许多处测水站，整理了旧有的地质资料，初步使地质、测量和采掘三个环节衔接了起来。地质测量开始发挥对生产的指导监督作用，检查出了数十件无煤的事件。实行合理的机械化和改善职工的劳动条件，也是生产技术改革的重要部分，如取消井下运输的骡马，代之以电车运输，人力推车的天桥改建为自动滑行，改进井下通风等。为了适应生产机械化程度的增长，他们同时大规模地展开了培养技术工人的工作。
    行政管理机构的改革，是全面生产改革的主要关键。因为只有领导机构首先健全起来，才能保证生产改革的顺利进行和巩固。他们首先根据生产区域管理制的原则，对采煤区和掘进区的组织机构进行了改革，加强对现场生产的领导。开滦煤矿总管理处和各矿各部门中的重叠组织，也进行合并，取消了一百零九个股，并建立了总工程师室，加强技术领导。机构改革后可抽出许多干部，简化了业务手续，也提高了工作效率。在整顿组织机构的同时，还进行了劳动组织同工资形式的改革。去年生产改革前，开滦煤矿还要求增加六千人，经初步调整后，不但未增加，反可抽出约四千人。全矿劳动效率比过去提高了。但劳动组织的整顿还很不彻底，现正继续进行中。
    在生产改革中，还按照投资小，效果大的原则，有计划有步骤地对有些矿井进行改建和恢复，以充分发挥潜力。十八年前帝国主义者为了镇压工人罢工斗争而封闭的马家沟矿，已在去年十二月一日开始排除井下的积水，正式动工恢复。唐山矿某号井只局部改建后，每年将能多生产六十万到七十万吨煤。林西矿只作局部的改建后，每年也将增产约五十万吨煤。
    全面生产改革的进行，给这座古老的矿山带来了生气。改革方案全部实现后，全矿区的产量到一九五七年将增长为一九五三年的二倍，矿区的面貌将为之一新。几个月来的事实，说明了对旧有矿山进行全面生产改革的方针是完全正确的和必要的。
    但是全面生产改革是一件异常复杂的组织工作，领导力量上必须有很好的安排。这方面，开滦煤矿也还有很大的缺点，生产改革同当前生产结合得不好，结果形成顾此失彼，既影响了生产任务的完成，又延缓了改革工作的进行。不少改革工作还做得不深不透，效果还不明显，生产被动局面还未扭转。他们应当努力改正这方面的缺点，把全面生产改革工作坚持不懈地贯彻到底。
