Why Coal Flies to the Sky
    Wang Lan

    This year, with the spring wind blowing, the four suburbs of the Linxi Mine in Kailuan are filled with black air. Farmers in villages four or five miles away from Linxi Mine, such as Xiaolei Village, Dazhuangtuo, and Xinzhuangzi, have all raised the same question: “It’s really strange! In previous years, the dust blown by the spring wind was yellow, but why has the dust blown this year turned black?”

    No! What is flying in the sky is not dust, but the main food of industry – coal. Why is coal flying in the sky? The reason is this:

    Before raw coal enters the washing process at the Kailuan Coal Washing Plant, a type of coal dust is blown out from the raw coal using a blower; workers call it dry smoke. Before last December, the coal washing plant had fewer tasks, so it mixed the dry smoke into the wet fine coal and put it into the fine coal screening machine for washing. In late December, due to an increase in coal washing tasks, the fine coal screening machine equipment was not expanded, and the amount of wet fine coal being washed increased. The dry smoke could not be washed, so the coal washing plant handed over the dry smoke as a byproduct to the Kailuan Sales Office for sale, with the Linxi Mine Railway Transportation Section responsible for external transport. Soon after the production of dry smoke, the Kailuan Sales Office notified the Linxi Mine Railway Transportation Section: the dry smoke had been sold, and it should be shipped out as much as possible. However, the leaders of the Linxi Mine Railway Transportation Section have consistently adopted an extremely irresponsible attitude towards this valuable national wealth, emphasizing "heavy transportation tasks" and "shortage of wagons," failing to actively ship it out, and instead unloading most of the dry smoke in the mine's coal storage yard. From December 25th last year to March 16th this year, the dry smoke accumulated in the coal storage yard reached 9,161 tons. Because dry smoke is similar to flour, fine and light, the workers in the coal storage yard, worried that it would be blown away by the spring wind, have repeatedly suggested to the Linxi Mine Railway Transportation Section since January that it be transported away quickly. However, the leading cadres of the transportation section not only did not find a way to transport it out, but also did not take any measures to prevent the dry smoke from being blown away by the wind.

    From the beginning of February to March 17th, there were four strong winds, which swept a large amount of dry smoke into the sky. The total length of the stored dry smoke was 547 meters, the total width was about 20 meters, and the average height was 3 meters. It is preliminarily estimated that at least one meter of height, about 1,000 tons, was blown away in the four strong winds, with a value of more than 9,200 yuan (9.23 yuan per ton).

    The workers painstakingly excavated the coal from hundreds of feet deep underground, but the section chief of the Linxi Mine Railway Transportation Section and the people involved treated the fruits of the workers' labor with such an attitude. Even more seriously, after the dry smoke was blown away by the wind, they remained unmoved and nonchalantly said: "We have no way, even if the three of us section chiefs lie on the dry smoke pile, we can't cover it."

    Comrades of the Linxi Mine Railway Transportation Section, you should wake up and actively transport the remaining dry smoke away. Otherwise, if a few more strong winds blow or heavy rain falls, I am afraid you will not see a single grain of dry smoke. It will be too late to save it then.

    Responsible comrades of Linxi Mine, why do you also allow coal to fly into the sky without asking about it?

    煤炭为何飞上天空
    王蓝
    今年来，一刮起春风，开滦林西矿四郊就黑气冲天。离开林西矿四五里地远的小雷庄、大庄坨、新庄子等村的农民们都发出了同样的疑问：“真是怪！往年春风刮来的尘土都是黄色的，为什么今年刮来的尘土变成黑色的呢？”
    不！在春风中飞腾的不是尘土，而是工业的主要食粮——煤炭。煤炭为什么在天空飞腾呢？原因是这样的：
    开滦洗煤厂在原煤入洗前，用吹风机从原煤中吹出一种煤末，工人把它叫干烟子。去年十二月以前，洗煤厂任务较少，就把干烟子渗在湿末煤中到末煤淘汰机入洗。到了十二月下旬，由于洗煤任务增加，末煤淘汰机设备没有扩充，湿末煤入洗量增加，干烟子不能入洗，于是洗煤厂就将干烟子当作副产品交给开滦销售处销售，由林西矿铁路运输科负责向外发运。在干烟子生产不久，开滦销售处即通知林西矿铁路运输科：干烟子已经售出，尽量往外发运。但是林西矿铁路运输科领导上对这部分国家宝贵的财富却始终采取极不负责的态度，强调“运输任务重”、“车皮少”，不积极往外发运，而将干烟子大部分卸在本矿存煤场上。从去年十二月二十五日到今年三月十六日，在存煤场积存的干烟子共达九千一百六十一吨。因为干烟子和面粉差不多，又细又轻，存煤场的工人们，耽心春风一来被刮跑，从一月以来，就屡次建议林西矿铁路运输科赶快把它运走。但是，运输科的领导干部不但没有想法运出，并且对如何防止干烟子被风刮跑也没有采取任何措施。
    从二月初到三月十七日，共刮了四次大风，把干烟子大量卷入天空。存放的干烟子总长度五百四十七公尺，总宽度约二十公尺，平均高度三公尺，在四次大风中被刮走的干烟子约有一公尺来高，据初步计算，最少达一千吨，价值九千二百多元（每吨九点二三元）。
    工人们辛辛苦苦地将煤炭从几百丈深的地下挖掘出来，林西矿铁路运输科科长和有关的人们却用这样的态度来对待工人们的劳动果实。更严重的是当干烟子被风刮走后，他们仍然面不改色，满不在乎地说：“我们毫无办法，就是我们三个科长都去躺在干烟子堆上也盖不住。”
    林西矿铁路运输科的同志们，你们该清醒了，应该积极把尚存的干烟子运走了，不然再刮几阵大风或下起大雨来，恐怕你们就看不见一粒干烟子的影子！那时再挽救也来不及了。
    林西矿的负责同志们，你们为什么也听任煤炭飞上天空而不过问呢？
