Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, April 9th (Tass dispatch): Soviet representative Nesterov spoke on the morning of April 8th at the plenary session of the Asian Countries Conference. He began his speech by emphasizing the significant role of international trade in consolidating international peace.

Nesterov pointed out that the Soviet Union and the socialist camp countries adhere to the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence in international economic cooperation.

These principles also form the basis of trade relations between the Soviet Union and Asian countries. At the same time, the Soviet Union also adheres to the principle of doing its best to help Asian countries economically. Nesterov said, "Providing technical assistance to Asian countries in developing their own industries, expanding trade, and ensuring that their goods find a market in exchange with us is our consistent desire."

Nesterov said that the Soviet Union is conducting trade with India, China, Japan, Afghanistan, and other Asian countries. According to the Soviet-Indian agreement signed on February 2, 1955, the Soviet Union is providing India with preferential long-term loans to build a metallurgical plant with an annual output of one million tons of steel.

The Soviet Union has also provided Afghanistan with significant technical assistance.

Nesterov went on to say that the participation of the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia in the United Nations' fund for technical assistance to underdeveloped countries is a major practical contribution to helping Asian countries develop their economies. The countries concerned can obtain top-notch technical assistance from Soviet experts. Young people from these countries can study in schools in the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia.

International industrial and commercial exhibitions and expositions are important ways to promote the development of international trade. Nesterov said that the Soviet Union participated in exhibitions held in eleven countries in 1954, including China and Indonesia.

In 1955, the Soviet Union plans to participate in exhibitions in Delhi, Karachi, Rangoon, and Guangzhou. The Soviet exhibition in Shanghai has already opened.

In 1954, economic delegations from India, Indonesia, Burma, Pakistan, and Japan visited the Soviet Union. Nesterov pointed out, "The exchange of economic and trade delegations is an important way to promote international economic cooperation."

When talking about trade issues between Asian and Far Eastern countries, Nesterov said that the Soviet Union intends to help Asian countries normalize their foreign trade. He pointed out that trade between socialist camp countries and Asian countries is based on barter trade with long-term stable prices. With the consent of all parties, accounts are settled in local currencies. The establishment of regular economic ties with the People's Republic of China is of great significance to expanding trade in Asian countries.

Nesterov continued: The actions of the United States to obstruct the development of trade in Asia and the Far East cannot but be regarded as actions against the interests of the Asian people and against the common desire of the Asian people to maintain and consolidate peace.

In order to obstruct the peaceful construction being carried out by the Chinese people, the United States has imposed an embargo on the People's Republic of China and intends to impose a naval blockade on the Chinese region through the Chiang Kai-shek elements. Although this shameful act of disrupting trade and freedom of navigation cannot hinder the economic development of the People's Republic of China, it does cause certain damage and is an obstacle to the development of trade and trade navigation in this region.

Nesterov said: "Freedom of navigation on the high seas is one of the most important conditions for ensuring normal international relations, and it should be guaranteed in all seas of Asian and Far Eastern countries. The continuous attacks on foreign merchant ships in Chinese waters hinder the development of international trade and pose a threat to peace and international security. This can no longer be tolerated, because it is an unprecedented violation of the norms of international trade law and poses a threat to the peace and economic interests of the peoples of Asia and the Far East.

"We have a responsibility to unremittingly fight against all forms of discrimination, restrictions, obstacles, and punitive measures adopted in trade and economic ties by those imperialist aggressor groups who are bent on launching bloody wars."

Nesterov concluded: "If we want to become true fighters for peace and friendship between peoples and serve this great cause honestly and faithfully, we must develop and consolidate economic, trade, and cultural ties and strengthen the bonds of friendship between us."

    在四月八日亚洲国家会议全体会议上
    涅斯捷罗夫作关于国际贸易问题的发言
    新华社讯　塔斯社德里九日电：苏联代表涅斯捷罗夫八日上午在亚洲国家会议全体会议上讲了话。他在讲话开始时，着重指出国际贸易在巩固国际和平中所起的重大作用。
    涅斯捷罗夫指出，苏联和社会主义阵营国家在国际经济合作中遵循着互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利以及和平共处的原则。
    这些原则也成为苏联同亚洲国家之间的贸易关系的基础。同时，苏联还遵循在经济方面尽力帮助亚洲国家的原则。涅斯捷罗夫说：“对亚洲国家发展本国工业的工作给予技术援助，扩大贸易，以保证它们的货物在和我们交换当中找到销路，这是我们一贯的愿望。”
    涅斯捷罗夫说，苏联同印度、中国、日本、阿富汗以及其他亚洲国家在进行贸易。根据一九五五年二月二日签订的苏印协定，苏联以优惠的长期贷款为印度建筑一个年产一百万吨钢的冶金工厂。
    苏联也给予了阿富汗巨大的技术帮助。
    涅斯捷罗夫接着说，苏联、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克参加联合国的对落后国家进行技术援助的基金，是在帮助亚洲国家经济发展方面的重大的实际贡献。有关国家可以获得苏联专家头等的技术援助。这些国家的青年可以在苏联、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的学校中学习。
    国际性的工商业展览会和博览会是促进国际贸易的发展的重要办法。涅斯捷罗夫说，苏联在一九五四年参加了在十一个国家举办的展览会，其中包括中国和印度尼西亚在内。
    一九五五年，苏联计划参加德里、喀喇蚩、仰光和广州的展览会。上海的苏联展览会已经开幕。
    在一九五四年，印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、巴基斯坦和日本的经济代表团都访问了苏联。涅斯捷罗夫指出，“互派经济和贸易代表团是促进国际经济合作的重要办法。”
    涅斯捷罗夫谈到亚洲和远东国家贸易问题时说，苏联打算帮助亚洲国家使它们的对外贸易正常化。他指出，社会主义阵营的国家同亚洲国家的贸易是以长期稳定的价格为基础的换货贸易。根据各方的同意，用本国货币来结账。同中华人民共和国确立经常的经济联系对扩大亚洲国家的贸易有重大的意义。
    涅斯捷罗夫接着说：美国阻挠亚洲和远东的贸易发展的行动，不能不被认为是反对亚洲人民的利益、反对亚洲人民维护和巩固和平的共同愿望的行动。
    美国为了阻挠中国人民所进行的和平建设，对中华人民共和国实行了禁运，并打算通过蒋介石分子对中国地区实行海上封锁。虽然这种破坏贸易和航海自由的可耻的行为不能妨碍中华人民共和国的经济发展，但是它终究造成一定的损害，并且是这
  一地区发展贸易和贸易通航的障碍。
    涅斯捷罗夫说：“公海航行自由是保证正常的国际来往关系的最重要的条件之一，应当在亚洲和远东各国的所有海上予以保障。外国商船在中国海面上所遭到的不断的侵袭阻碍着国际贸易的发展，是对和平和国际安全的一种威胁。这是再也不能容忍的了，因为这是史无前例地破坏了国际贸易法准则，给和平和亚洲及远东各国人民的经济利益造成威胁。
      “我们有责任坚持不懈地进行斗争来反对种种歧视、限制、障碍和惩罚措施，这些都是那些一心要发动流血战争的帝国主义侵略集团在贸易和经济联系方面所采取的手段。”
    涅斯捷罗夫最后说：“如果我们要成为争取和平和各国人民之间的友谊的真正战士，诚实地和忠诚地为这一伟大的事业服务，我们就要发展和巩固经济、贸易和文化联系，加强我们之间的友谊纽带。”
