Decision on Convening the National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism
(Adopted by the Second Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League on February 26, 1955)

I. Since our great motherland entered the first Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development in 1953, young men and women across the country, under the great call of the Chinese Communist Party and our beloved leader and teacher Comrade Mao Zedong for "Good health, good study, and good work," have actively participated in the socialist construction of the motherland. Tens of thousands of young advanced producers, model workers, and heroic models defending the motherland have emerged. They are infinitely loyal to the motherland, and with their labor and wisdom, have created outstanding achievements on all fronts. This year is a year of decisive significance for our country to realize the first Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development, and it is also a year for us to continue to strive for the liberation of Taiwan and the defense of world peace. In order to further unleash the enthusiasm and creativity of young people across the country in socialist construction, commend the contributions of young activists on all fronts to the motherland, and publicize and promote their advanced experiences and fine qualities to young people across the country, so as to better mobilize them to fight for the liberation of Taiwan and strive to complete and overfulfill the tasks of the first Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development, the Second Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League decided to convene the National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism in the capital of the motherland—Beijing—on September 20, 1955.

II. The number of delegates attending this conference is 1,500, and they should be young socialist builders and defenders of the motherland who have achieved outstanding results on various fronts since 1953, including:
