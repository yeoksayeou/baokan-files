    Soil and Water Conservation Begins in the Upper Reaches of the Yongding River

    In order to provide experience for the comprehensive development of soil and water conservation work in the upper reaches of the Yongding River, Zhangjiakou Special District of Hebei Province has designated 31 villages, including Changjiagou in Huaian County and Zhongcaizhuang in Wei County, as key areas for soil and water conservation in the special district, and has formulated a 1955 soil and water conservation project implementation plan.

    The total area of this region is 130 square kilometers, all of which are loess hilly areas in the semi-mountainous area. The terrain is sloping, with steep slopes and many gullies. The soil structure is loose, the mountain slopes have little ground cover, and cultivation is extensive, resulting in serious soil erosion. In order to conserve soil and water and develop agricultural production, the agricultural and forestry, water conservancy, and animal husbandry departments of the special commissioner's office organized two survey teams to go to the countryside for surveys in early February, and completed the survey and planning work by early March. A total of more than 1,100 various check dams and reservoirs are planned to be built, more than 980,000 meters of contour terraces and field ridges are to be dug, more than 300 mu of terraced fields are to be built, more than 480 mu of afforestation is to be carried out, and 100 mu of alfalfa is to be planted. The completion of this plan will greatly contribute to increasing production.

    At present, mutual aid and cooperation organizations in the region are actively implementing this plan, organizing labor and preparing materials, and plan to start construction in early April. (Zhang Dexin)

    永定河上游开始保持水土
    为给永定河上游全面开展水土保持工作提供经验，河北省张家口专区确定以怀安县常家沟和蔚县中蔡庄等三十一个村，为该专区水土保持重点区，并制定了一九五五年水土保持工程实施计划。
    这个地区总面积有一百三十平方公里，均属半山区的黄土丘陵地带，地形倾斜，坡陡、沟多，土壤结构疏松，山坡地面复盖少，耕作粗放，水土流失严重。为保持水土，发展农业生产，该专署农林、水利、畜牧部门于二月初，组织了两个勘查小组下乡勘查，到三月初即完成了勘查规划工作，共计划修建各种谷坊坝和蓄水池等一千一百多处，挖水平沟和打田间土埂九十八万多公尺，修梯田三百多亩，植树造林四百八十多亩，种苜蓿一百亩。这个计划完成后，对增加生产将有很大作用。
    目前，该地区互助合作组织正在积极贯彻这个计划，组织劳力和准备工料等，计划在四月初开始施工。（张德新）
