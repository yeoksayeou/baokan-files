    At the construction site of China's first tractor manufacturing plant, various processing plants needed for large-scale factory construction are being built. The timber processing plant, sanitary material structure plant, and mechanical repair plant have already started construction; the concrete component prefabrication plant, reinforced concrete foam plant, concrete mixing plant, lime melting plant, and metal structure processing plant will also start construction soon.

    Most of the machinery and equipment needed for the various processing plants have been transported to the construction sites of the processing plants that have started construction, and a large number of workers installing this machinery and equipment are basically ready; various personnel participating in the production of the processing plants have also been centrally trained or sent to other factories for internships.

    These processing plants mainly serve the factory building construction project of the tractor manufacturing plant, and they will be put into production successively before the construction of the tractor manufacturing plant's factory buildings begins this year.

    拖拉机厂工地兴建加工厂
    在我国第一个拖拉机制造厂工地上，正在建筑为大规模工厂化施工所需的各种加工厂。木材加工厂、卫生材料结构厂、机械修配厂已经开工了；混凝土构件预制厂、钢筋泡沫混凝土厂、混凝土搅拌厂、石灰融化厂和金属结构加工厂，不久也要开工。
    在开工的加工厂工地上，已经运到了各种加工厂所需的大部分的机器设备，有很大一部分安装这些机器设备的工人，也大体上准备妥当；参加加工厂生产的各种人员，也已集中训练，或是派到其他工厂实习。
    这些加工厂主要是为拖拉机制造厂的厂房建筑工程服务的，在今年拖拉机制造厂的厂房开工兴建前，它们就要先后投入生产。　　　（新华社）
