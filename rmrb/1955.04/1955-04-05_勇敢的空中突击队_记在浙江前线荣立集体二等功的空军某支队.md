    Brave Air Assault Team
    ——On the Air Force Unit Awarded Collective Second-Class Merit for Service on the Zhejiang Front
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Xiao Huang

    At the First Congress of Heroes, Model Workers and Meritorious Servants of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force, I interviewed four representatives from an Air Force unit that won a collective second-class merit on the Zhejiang front: Liu Dong, Wang Yufeng, and Fu Baowen, who are excellent air commanders, and Liu Jianhan, a courageous pilot. They enthusiastically introduced the heroic battles of their ground attack aircraft unit on the Zhejiang front.

    On the morning of November 1, 1954, under the cover of a ground attack aircraft formation, Wang Yufeng led a flight of aircraft to bomb Chiang Kai-shek's military positions on Dachen Island. When our aircraft formation suddenly appeared over the heads of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, the ground and naval anti-aircraft artillery of Chiang Kai-shek's troops frantically fired at the sky. Wang Yufeng calmly led the formation, deftly maneuvering through the gaps in the barrage, suddenly diving down on Chiang Kai-shek's anti-aircraft artillery positions, dropping a large number of bombs, instantly silencing Chiang Kai-shek's anti-aircraft guns. Then, a command post of Chiang Kai-shek's troops was also bombed, turning it into a sea of fire.

    Encouraged by the victory in the first battle, the unit then cooperated with the bomber formation to successfully bomb Chiang Kai-shek's warships in the harbor of Dachen Island. On January 10, 1955, a Force 7 gale swept the Zhejiang sea, and the temperature plummeted to minus seven degrees Celsius. Under these severe weather conditions, the unit bravely took off again, led by squadron leaders Liu Dong and Wang Yufeng respectively. When the formation was still a long distance from the airspace over Dachen Island, Chiang Kai-shek's anti-aircraft artillery fired densely into the sky, attempting to block their advance; Chiang Kai-shek's warships anchored in Dachen Harbor were frightened and turned around in circles, some desperately trying to escape to the open sea, but were pushed back into the harbor by the raging waves. At this time, the formations led by Liu Dong and Wang Yufeng had already flown over the harbor of Dachen Island, broke through the clouds, and launched a fierce bombing attack on Chiang Kai-shek's warships, immediately blasting one of them into a blazing inferno.

    That afternoon, the unit's aircraft formation again flew over Dachen Island. Disregarding the anti-aircraft fire from Chiang Kai-shek's warships, the formation quickly searched for targets on the sea surface. Liu Jianhan, an excellent young pilot, firmly locked onto a Chiang Kai-shek's "Zhong" class landing ship (previously mistaken for a supply ship), precisely adjusted his speed and angle, and then pressed the bomb release button. At this moment, the gunner behind him excitedly reported on the radio: "Hit, hit! The warship is on fire!" Liu Jianhan also saw: three thick black plumes of smoke mixed with flames rising into the sky from the rear of this Chiang Kai-shek's "Zhong" class landing ship. Then, Liu Dong led the third wave of aircraft, damaging another Chiang Kai-shek's "Zhong" class landing ship. Under the fierce attacks of our bombing and assault forces, Chiang Kai-shek's warships dared not anchor near Dachen Island during the day anymore.

    On January 18, this air assault team, in coordination with fraternal Air Force units, established new merits for the motherland in the battle to liberate Yijiangshan Island, in conjunction with the Army and Navy.

    That morning, the unit's aircraft formation bombed and strafed Chiang Kai-shek's beachhead positions on Yijiangshan Island and Chiang Kai-shek's howitzer positions on Dachen Island in successive waves. At 2:00 PM, after the bomber formation, in coordination with the ground artillery group, fiercely bombarded Chiang Kai-shek's forward positions on Yijiangshan Island, this ground attack aircraft unit, led by Liu Dong, Fu Baowen, and Ni Jinsheng respectively, once again flew over Yijiangshan Island. The pilots took turns bombing and strafing Chiang Kai-shek's positions. At this time, the order came over the radio: "The army has successfully landed and is continuing to advance in depth!" Liu Dong immediately led his formation to fly quickly over Hill 203 on the island. At this time, our artillery was fiercely bombarding Chiang Kai-shek's troops on this hill. Liu Dong immediately directed the formation he was leading to fiercely bomb the hill. Hill 203 was instantly transformed into a mountain of flames under the intense bombardment of artillery shells and bombs. As Liu Dong led the formation back, he saw army soldiers holding high the bright red flag in the smoke and quickly charging towards Hill 203.

    Because it successfully completed its missions in every battle, this unit was honorably awarded the collective second-class merit. At the First Congress of Heroes, Model Workers and Meritorious Servants of the Air Force, after the congress election and the approval of the Air Force leaders, Liu Jianhan was awarded the title of Air Force "Second-Class Combat Hero."

    勇敢的空中突击队
    ——记在浙江前线荣立集体二等功的空军某支队
    新华社记者　萧璜
    在中国人民解放军空军首届英雄模范功臣代表大会上，我访问了来自浙江前线的荣立集体二等功的空军某支队的四位代表，他们是优秀的空中指挥员刘栋、王玉峰、傅宝文和英勇的飞行员刘健汉。他们兴致勃勃地向我介绍了他们所在的这支强击机支队在浙江前线的英勇战斗。
    一九五四年十一月一日上午，在强击机群的掩护下，王玉峰率领机群轰炸大陈岛蒋贼军阵地。当我军机群突然出现在蒋贼军的头顶时，地面上、军舰上的蒋贼军高射炮火慌乱地向天空射击。王玉峰沉着地带领着机群，矫健而巧妙地穿越在火网的空隙里，它们猛然向蒋贼军高射炮阵地俯冲下去，投下了大量的炸弹，蒋贼军的高射炮顿时被炸得变成哑吧了。接着，蒋贼军一个指挥所也被炸得燃成一片火海。
    在首战获胜的鼓舞下，这个支队接着又配合轰炸机群胜利地轰炸了大陈岛港湾里的蒋贼军舰。一九五五年一月十日，浙江海面刮起了七级大风，气温骤降到零下七度，就在这种恶劣的气候下，这个支队又在带队长机刘栋、王玉峰分别率领下，英勇地起飞了。当机群离大陈岛上空还有很远的距离时，蒋贼军的高射炮火就密集地向天空中发射起来，企图拦阻他们的前进道路；停泊在大陈港湾里的蒋贼军舰都吓得团团乱转，有的慌忙向外海里逃窜，但又被汹涌的海浪扑得退回港湾里，这时，刘栋、王玉峰分别带领的机群已经飞临大陈岛的港湾，穿出云层，对准蒋贼军舰进行了猛烈的轰炸，当即把其中的一艘炸得烟火冲天。
    当天下午，这个支队的机群又飞临大陈岛上空。机群不顾蒋贼军舰发射的高射炮火，迅速地搜索着海面上的目标。优秀的青年飞行员刘健汉牢牢地盯住了蒋贼军的一艘中字号登陆舰（前误为后勤舰），精确地修正好了航速与角度，接着便按了投弹按钮。这时，坐在他后面的射击员马上在无线电中兴奋地报告说：“炸中了，炸中了！军舰起火了！”刘健汉也看到：三股浓浓的黑色烟柱夹着火光正在这艘蒋贼中字号登陆舰的后半部升上天空。接着，刘栋又率领第三批机群，炸伤了另一艘蒋贼中字号登陆舰。在我轰炸部队和冲击部队的猛烈打击下，蒋贼军舰在白天再也不敢停泊在大陈岛附近了。
    一月十八日，这支空中突击队在和兄弟空军部队一道协同陆、海军解放一江山岛的战斗中，又为祖国建树了功勋。
    当天上午，这个支队的机群分批轰炸和俯冲射击了一江山岛上的蒋贼军滩头阵地和大陈岛蒋贼军榴弹炮阵地。下午二时，当轰炸机群配合地面炮兵群猛轰一江山岛蒋贼军前沿阵地后，这支强击机支队又在刘栋、傅宝文、倪金升分别率领下再次飞临一江山岛上空，飞行员们轮番向蒋贼军阵地进行了轰炸、俯冲射击。这时，无线电里传来了命令：“陆军部队已经顺利登陆，继续向纵深进攻！”刘栋立刻带领着他的机群迅速飞向岛上二○三高地上空，这时，我军炮兵正在向这个高地上的蒋贼军进行猛烈的轰击。刘栋马上指挥他带领的机群向这个高地上进行了猛烈轰炸。二○三高地顿时在炮弹和炸弹的猛轰下变成了一座火焰山。当刘栋带领机群返航时，看到陆军勇士们正在烟硝中高举着鲜艳的红旗迅速向二○三高地冲去。
    由于在历次战斗中都胜利地完成了任务，这个支队光荣地立了集体二等功。在空军首届英雄模范功臣代表大会上，经过大会选举和空军首长批准，刘健汉被授予空军“二级战斗英雄”称号。
