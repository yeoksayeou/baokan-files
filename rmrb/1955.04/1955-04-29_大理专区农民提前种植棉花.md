Farmers in Dali Prefecture Plant Cotton Early

The cotton farmers of various ethnic groups in Dali Prefecture, the main cotton-producing area of Yunnan Province, have started planting cotton early this year. As of April 15th, they have sown more than 60,000 mu. The remaining cotton fields will also be sown entirely before the end of April. The cotton planted before Qingming Festival has already grown a pair or two of tender leaves.

The farmers of various ethnic groups in Dali Prefecture used to plant cotton after the Xiaochun harvest around the Beginning of Summer. Therefore, when the cotton bolls formed, they were often knocked off by autumn rains. Last year, some cotton farmers in Binchuan County planted cotton in wheat fields before the wheat was harvested. After the wheat harvest, they intensified cultivation and fertilization, and the cotton plants were very robust. When the autumn rains came, they had already formed bolls and flowered, and were not afraid of being hit by rain, thus achieving a bumper harvest. This spring, the CPC Dali Prefectural Committee summarized and promoted the cotton planting experience of Binchuan County, and many cotton farmers planted cotton in wheat fields before the Qingming Festival. In areas where broad beans, peas and other Xiaochun crops are being harvested, cotton farmers often rush to plant cotton under the moonlight.

    大理专区农民提前种植棉花
    云南省主要棉产区，大理专区各族棉农今年提前种植棉花，到四月十五日止，共已下种六万多亩。其余的棉田也将在四月底前全部下种。在清明节前下种的棉花，现已长出一对或两对嫩叶。
    大理专区的各族农民，原来习惯在立夏节前后，将小春收割完毕才种植棉花。所以每当棉花结铃时，常为秋雨打落。去年，宾川县的部分棉农，在小麦未收割时就在麦田里种棉，小麦收割后，加紧中耕、施肥，棉株非常壮茂，到秋雨降临时，已结铃开花，不怕雨打，因而获得丰收。今年春天，中共大理地委会总结和推广了宾川县的植棉经验，很多棉农在清明节前，就在小麦田里植棉。开始收割蚕豆、豌豆等小春作物的地区，常有棉农在月光下赶种棉花。　　　　　　　（松青）
