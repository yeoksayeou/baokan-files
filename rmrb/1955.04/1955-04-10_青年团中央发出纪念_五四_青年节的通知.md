The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League has issued a notice regarding the commemoration of the "May Fourth" Youth Day.

The notice states: In commemorating this year's "May Fourth" Youth Day, youth league organizations in various regions should educate and guide the broad masses of young people to further promote the patriotic tradition of Chinese youth, advocate national defense sports, strengthen physical exercise, and enhance their knowledge of culture, science, and technology; actively implement the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, resolutely oppose waste, and strive to better build and defend the motherland, and fight for the liberation of our territory, Taiwan.

The notice requires youth league organizations in various regions to carry out the following publicity and activities:

(1) In conjunction with the current affairs situation, further strengthen the education of young people in defending the motherland, and encourage young people to support the sacred struggle to liberate Taiwan with various practical actions. Every young person must not only learn the skills to build the motherland, but also learn the skills to defend the motherland. Enhance revolutionary vigilance, exercise the body, and be prepared to respond to the call of the motherland, enlist in the military, and contribute their strength to defending the motherland.

(2) Conduct education among the broad masses of young people on increasing production and practicing economy, and opposing waste, and mobilize young people to strive to actively complete and over fulfill our country's 1955 plan. The broad masses of young people must not only consolidate labor discipline, strive to improve their technical level, create more wealth for the country, and save more funds, but also boldly and in an organized manner expose corruption, waste, and various unreasonable phenomena in production, and actively put forward rationalization proposals for increasing production and practicing economy, so that the Youth League becomes a capable assistant to the Party on the anti-waste front.

(3) Various localities should, according to the above content, use newspapers, periodicals, and radio to carry out publicity; small-scale commemorative meetings can be held in large and medium-sized cities; in places where communist moral education is being carried out, it can be linked with the publicity for commemorating "May Fourth," so that young people understand that lofty communist moral qualities should be cultivated in the actual struggle to build and defend the motherland. Around "May Fourth," youth league organizations in various localities should cooperate with the sports committees and other relevant departments to widely organize mass sports activities of various kinds, and pay special attention to developing and promoting some military sports activities, such as shooting, boating, marching, mountain climbing, cross-country running, grenade throwing, military camping, etc., to create favorable conditions for further carrying out military sports activities in the future. When carrying out various commemorative activities, all regions should pay attention to attracting more and a wider range of young people to participate than in previous years.

    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会发出关于纪念“五四”青年节的通知。
    通知说：纪念今年“五四”青年节，各地青年团的组织应当教育和引导广大青年进一步发扬我国青年的爱国主义传统，提倡国防体育，锻炼身体，加强文化和科学技术知识的学习；积极贯彻增产节约的精神，坚决反对浪费现象；更好地为建设和保卫祖国，为解放我国领土台湾而斗争。
    通知要求各地团组织进行下列宣传和活动：
    （一）结合目前时事形势的宣传，对青年进一步加强保卫祖国的教育，鼓舞青年用各种实际行动来支援解放台湾的神圣斗争。每一个青年不仅要学会建设祖国的本领，而且要学会保卫祖国的本领。提高革命警惕，锻炼身体，时刻准备响应祖国的召唤，应征服兵役，为保卫祖国贡献自己的力量。
    （二）对广大青年进行增产节约、反对浪费的教育，动员青年为积极完成和超额完成我国一九五五年度的计划而奋斗。广大青年不仅自己要巩固劳动纪律，努力提高技术水平，为国家创造更多的财富，节约更多的资金，而且要大胆地有组织地揭发贪污、浪费及生产上的各种不合理现象，积极提出增产节约的合理化建议，使青年团成为党在反浪费战线上的得力助手。
    （三）各地应根据上述内容，利用报纸、刊物、广播展开宣传；在大、中城市内可举行小型的纪念会；正在开展共产主义道德教育的地方，可和纪念“五四”的宣传联系起来，使青年们懂得：崇高的共产主义道德品质应当在建设和保卫祖国的实际斗争中去培养。“五四”前后，各地团的组织应协同体委等有关部门，广泛地组织群众性的多种多样的体育活动，特别要注意开展和提倡一些军事体育活动，如射击、划船、行军、爬山、越野竞走、掷手榴弹、军事野营等，为今后进一步开展军事体育运动创造有利的条件。各地区在开展各种纪念活动时，应注意吸收比往年更多的、更广泛的青年群众参加。　（新华社）
