    Strengthen the Party's Propaganda Work in Labor Competitions
    The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a conference on propaganda work in factories and mines in early March, focusing on how to strengthen the Party's political work in labor competitions.
    In the past, the Party committees of various factories and mines in Taiyuan City have done a lot of propaganda work in labor competitions, but there are still many problems in the propaganda work. For example, many factories and mines, when cultivating labor models and publicizing advanced ideas, excessively emphasized individual roles and ignored the collective strength of the masses; at the same time, they lacked regular education for labor models, so that some very small shortcomings of some labor models gradually developed into serious shortcomings, and they eventually failed to be models. In 1953, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant had 170 labor models, but by 1954, only 40 remained. Formalism also exists in the propaganda work of some factories. In labor competitions, everyone only thinks of ways to publicize things like "skill trees," "skill flowers," "skill fruits," and "skill courtyards," but they do not pay attention to the content of the propaganda, and as a result, the effect is not great. The meeting studied the experiences and lessons introduced by various factories and mines. The experience and lessons of the propaganda work of the Shanxi Chemical Plant were also introduced at the meeting. In 1954, the Shanxi Chemical Plant vaguely publicized the improvement of backward indicators to workers in the labor competition. The workers asked, "You only say that our indicators are backward, but how backward are they exactly? How advanced are others, and why are they so advanced?" Propaganda personnel and administrative cadres could not say. Everyone found the indicator data for research and sent people to other factories to learn advanced experience, and then carried out specific propaganda. At the same time, the fact that the Shanxi Chemical Plant failed to complete the oxygen production task, causing the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant to suspend work and lose more than 10,000 work hours, was used to illustrate the significance of supporting heavy industry factories and mines. As a result, the workers not only made up for the more than 20,000 cubic meters of oxygen production tasks that had not been completed in eight months, but also overfulfilled the task by 3,900 cubic meters. These specific experiences and lessons gave the comrades attending the meeting great enlightenment and made them clear about the direction for improving propaganda work in labor competitions in the future.

    加强党在劳动竞赛中的宣传工作
    中共太原市委在三月上旬召开工矿宣传工作会议，着重讨论如何加强劳动竞赛中党的政治工作问题。
    太原市各厂矿企业党委过去在劳动竞赛中做了不少宣传工作，但是宣传工作中还存在着许多问题。例如不少厂矿在培养劳动模范、宣传先进思想时，过分强调个人作用，忽视集体的群众的力量；同时对劳动模范缺少经常的教育，以致有些劳动模范的一些很小的缺点逐渐发展成严重的缺点，终于当不了模范。太原钢铁厂一九五三年有一百七十名劳动模范，到一九五四年只剩了四十余名。有些厂的宣传工作还存在着形式主义的现象。在劳动竞赛中，大家只在“窍门树”“窍门花”“窍门果”“窍门大院”等宣传形式上想办法，而不注意宣传内容，结果作用不大。会议研究了各厂矿介绍的经验教训。会上还介绍了山西化学厂宣传工作的经验教训。山西化学厂一九五四年在劳动竞赛中空洞地向工人宣传提高落后指标，工人们问，光说我们指标落后，究竟落后到什么程度，人家究竟先进到什么程度，为什么能那样先进？宣传人员和行政干部都说不上来。大家就找出了指标资料进行研究，并派人去别厂学习了先进经验，然后进行了具体的宣传。同时，用化学厂完不成氧气生产任务，使得太原矿山机器厂停工，损失一万多工时的事实，来说明支援重工业厂矿的意义。这样一来，工人们不仅把八个月中未完成的两万多公秉氧气生产任务补上了，而且超额完成了三千九百公秉。这些具体的经验教训，给到会同志以很大的启示，使大家对今后改进劳动竞赛中的宣传工作有了明确的方向。　（方德桢）
