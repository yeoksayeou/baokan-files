    Shenyang and Harbin Stations
    Delayed Ticket Checks Delay Passengers
    To the Editor:
    Recently, I traveled to the Northeast several times and found that at the Shenyang and Harbin stations, the time between ticket checking and train departure was too short, causing passengers excessive anxiety. Some passengers simply didn't have enough time to board.
    Once, the train No. 203 departing from Changchun left because the ticket check was too late, and the tickets were not completely checked. Many passengers who had bought tickets could not get on the train. When passengers raised their opinions to the station staff, the staff said indifferently, "If this train can't go, you can take the next one, what's the big deal!" The passengers were very dissatisfied.
    Another time, train No. 102 departing from Harbin also caused some passengers who had bought tickets to be unable to board due to the same reason. Harbin Station is the starting station for train No. 102, and the time can be easily controlled, so this situation should not have occurred. I hope that the responsible comrades of these stations will carefully check the work of the ticket inspectors to prevent this from happening again.

　　Respectfully,
　　Jing Yuan

### 沈阳和哈尔滨两车站  检票太迟耽误旅客乘车

    沈阳和哈尔滨两车站
    检票太迟耽误旅客乘车编辑同志：
    不久前我几次去东北，发现沈阳和哈尔滨两车站在开车前，检票距离开车的时间太短，使旅客过分紧张，有些旅客简直来不及上车。
    有一次，从长春开出的二○三次列车，就由于检票的时间太晚，票还未检完，列车就开走了，许多已经买上车票的旅客都搭不上车。旅客向车站人员提出意见，车站人员若无其事地说：“这次车走不了，下次车再走，这有啥关系！”旅客们很不满意。
    又一次从哈尔滨开出的一二次列车，也是由于同样原因使一些已经买了票的旅客来不及上车。哈尔滨车站是一二次车的起点站，在时间上很容易控制，因此，更不应该发生这种情况。我希望这些车站的负责同志认真地检查检票员的工作，防止这种事情再度发生。　敬远
