Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 13th: The Egyptian delegation to the Asian-African Conference, led by Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser, arrived in New Delhi on the 12th from Karachi. Those who went to the airport to welcome them included Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Indian government ministers, and foreign diplomatic envoys to India.

Answering reporters' questions at the airport regarding the Middle East military bloc, Nasser said that Egypt is only interested in its own independence. Egypt opposes the organization of pacts because it wants to complete the task of independence.

Nasser will stay in New Delhi for three days and will hold talks with Nehru.

On the same day, the Afghan delegation to the Asian-African Conference, led by Afghan Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sardar Mohammed Naim Khan, also arrived in New Delhi. Naim Khan will also stay in New Delhi for three days.

Prior to this, the Liberian delegation to the Asian-African Conference had already arrived in New Delhi on the 11th, en route to Indonesia.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 14th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru held a mass rally in New Delhi on the 13th to welcome Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser and Afghan Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammed Naim Khan. Nasser and Naim Khan were visiting India on their way to attend the Asian-African Conference.

Nehru said at the meeting that the Asian-African Conference represents "a new vitality in Asia." He pointed out that the Asian-African Conference is the first time in history that representatives of Asian and African countries have gathered together, while in the past few centuries, Asians have had no part in political, economic, and international affairs.

Referring to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, Nehru pointed out that there is nothing objectionable in the Five Principles. He said: "I do think that anyone who approaches international problems in a spirit of peace and friendship cannot disagree with these principles."

Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser said in his speech that he is confident that the newly signed Indo-Egyptian friendship treaty will expand the scope of cooperation between the two countries in economic, social, and cultural fields.
