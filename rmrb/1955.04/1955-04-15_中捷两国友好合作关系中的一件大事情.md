    The "Exhibition of Achievements in Ten Years of Socialist Construction in Czechoslovakia" opens today at the Soviet Exhibition Center in our capital, Beijing. This exhibition is the largest and most comprehensive one held abroad by the Czechoslovak Republic since its founding. It comprehensively introduces the brilliant achievements made by the Czechoslovak people in developing their economy, culture, and especially their industry, over the past ten years since liberation. Our people welcome the holding of this exhibition with great excitement and admiration, and regard it as a major event in the friendly relations between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples.
    Czechoslovak industry has long been famous throughout the world. However, during the era of capitalist rule, Czechoslovakia's industrial development was extremely unbalanced, mainly focusing on light industrial sectors such as textiles, shoemaking, and glass manufacturing. Heavy industry—especially the machine-building industry—was not very developed. At the same time, many industrial raw materials relied on foreign countries, and the main industrial products were not produced for domestic consumption but for export. This situation made Czechoslovakia's economy particularly vulnerable to the manipulation of international monopoly capital and the impact of capitalist economic crises. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak people, through the efforts of a two-year plan and a five-year plan, not only greatly increased the quantity of Czechoslovakia's industrial production, but also fundamentally changed its structure. Before liberation, the bourgeoisie spent nearly 150 years to reach the industrial level of 1937. In Czechoslovakia under the people's democratic system, it took only five years (the first five-year plan period from 1949 to 1953) to exceed this level by more than double. In 1954, the proportion of industry in Czechoslovakia's entire national economy increased from 56 percent in 1948 to 70 percent; the proportion of heavy industry in the entire industry increased from 57.6 percent to 62.3 percent. In the production of coal, steel, pig iron, and electricity, Czechoslovakia has stood among the countries with the highest output in the world, and some have even surpassed industrialized capitalist countries such as Britain, France, and West Germany.
    Of particular significance for promoting the development and transformation of Czechoslovakia's entire national economy is the development of its machine-building industry. Now the output value of the machine-building industry accounts for one-third of Czechoslovakia's total national industrial output value, and nearly half of the country's export goods. Czechoslovakia can now manufacture almost all kinds of machinery, machines and equipment, including various metalworking machine tools, complete sets of metallurgical equipment, powerful electrical equipment, cranes, excavators, complex agricultural machines, and precision machinery, etc. Czechoslovak industrial products are sold all over the world and enjoy a high reputation.
    The great achievements Czechoslovakia has made in developing its industry are inseparable from the selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union and its economic cooperation with the fraternal countries. And these achievements have also made an important contribution to the economic upsurge of the entire peace and democracy camp.
    The friendly and cooperative relations between China and Czechoslovakia have greatly developed since the founding of the People's Republic of China in October 1949 and the establishment of new diplomatic relations between the two countries. Since 1950, the trade volume between the two countries has expanded year by year. According to recent statistics, the trade volume between China and Czechoslovakia in 1955 has increased more than three and a half times compared with 1950. At the same time, scientific and technological cooperation and cultural exchanges between China and Czechoslovakia have also become increasingly close in recent years.
    The leaders of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the Czechoslovak government attach great importance to strengthening friendly and cooperative relations with the Chinese people. Gottwald, the beloved leader of the Czechoslovak people and former President of Czechoslovakia, once said: We should do everything possible to meet the demands made by the Chinese people to our country. In recent years, our country has obtained complete sets of equipment for power stations, chemical fertilizer factories, sugar factories, and film processing factories from Czechoslovakia, as well as many other machines and equipment, steel, petroleum, and transportation equipment used in mining, metallurgy, and construction industries. Czechoslovakia not only supplies our country with complete sets of industrial equipment, but also takes responsibility for all the work from surveying, design, installation to commissioning in the construction of these factories. For the production tasks ordered by our country, the workers of Czechoslovakia enthusiastically strive to complete them on time or ahead of schedule. Czechoslovak experts working in some factories and enterprises in our country also work tirelessly to help our workers and technicians master the use of modern machinery and equipment, so that they can quickly improve their technical level.
    This kind of assistance from Czechoslovakia to our country is a strong support for our country to complete the recovery of the national economy and accelerate the implementation of the first five-year plan. At the same time, the various necessary industrial raw materials, food, meat, etc. supplied by our country to Czechoslovakia also contribute to the smooth development of Czechoslovak industry and the needs of the people's lives. This fraternal cooperation between China and Czechoslovakia is a concrete manifestation of the new type of international relations between countries in the peace and democracy camp. This cooperation strengthens the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and helps to consolidate the cause of world peace.
    The holding of the "Exhibition of Achievements in Ten Years of Socialist Construction in Czechoslovakia" in China is a sign of further development of the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Czechoslovakia. During the exhibition, various machines and equipment displayed at the exhibition will be demonstrated in actual operation, workers and technicians from China and Czechoslovakia will conduct technical exchange activities, and many Czechoslovak experts will also visit and hold discussions in various related factories and enterprises. At the same time, the Czechoslovak Puppet Theater, dance troupe and volleyball team also came to our country for extensive visits, performances and competitions. All these will greatly enhance the friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples.
    After being exhibited in Beijing, this exhibition will also be held in other cities in our country. The vast number of workers, peasants, cadres and people from all walks of life in our country will be able to use this opportunity to conduct very beneficial visits and studies. We must learn from the advanced technologies and rich experiences created and accumulated by the hardworking and intelligent Czechoslovak people in the struggle to develop industry and build socialism, and apply what we have learned to our country's socialist construction cause. Past facts have proved that the various exhibitions held by the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries in our country have played a significant role in introducing advanced experiences to our people and promoting friendly cooperation between our people and the people of fraternal countries. We firmly believe that the "Exhibition of Achievements in Ten Years of Socialist Construction in Czechoslovakia" will also achieve great success in our country.

### 中捷两国友好合作关系中的一件大事情

    中捷两国友好合作关系中的一件大事情
    “捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会”今天在我国首都北京的苏联展览馆开幕了。这个展览会是捷克斯洛伐克共和国成立以来在国外举办的规模最大、内容最丰富的综合性展览会。它向我们全面地介绍了捷克斯洛伐克人民解放十年来在发展经济、文化，特别是在发展工业方面所取得的辉煌成就。我国人民怀着十分兴奋和钦佩的心情欢迎这个展览会的举办，并把它看作是中捷两国人民友好关系中的一件大事情。
    捷克斯洛伐克的工业是早就驰名于世界的。但是在资本主义统治时代，捷克斯洛伐克的工业发展极不平衡，主要的是纺织、制鞋和制造玻璃等轻工业部门，重工业——特别是机器制造工业还不甚发达。同时许多工业原料都仰赖于国外，而主要的工业产品又都不是为了本国消费而是为了输出生产的。这种情况，使得捷克斯洛伐克的经济特别容易受到国际垄断资本的操纵和资本主义经济危机的影响。解放以后，捷克斯洛伐克人民在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下，经过了一个两年计划和一个五年计划的努力，不仅使捷克斯洛伐克的工业生产在数量上有了极大的增加，而且也在结构上发生了根本的变化。在解放以前，资产阶级差不多花了将近一百五十年的时间才达到了一九三七年的工业水平，而在人民民主制度的捷克斯洛伐克，只用短短的五年时间（一九四九—一九五三年的第一个五年计划时期）就超过了这一水平一倍以上。一九五四年，工业在捷克斯洛伐克整个国民经济中的比重，已从一九四八年的百分之五十六提高到百分之七十；重工业在整个工业中的比重已从百分之五十七点六增加到百分之六十二点三。在煤、钢、生铁和电力的生产方面，捷克斯洛伐克都已站在世界上产量最多的国家之列，有些甚至超过了像英、法和西德那样工业发达的资本主义国家。
    对于促进捷克斯洛伐克整个国民经济的发展和改造具有特殊重大意义的，是它的机器制造业的发展。现在机器制造业的产值已占捷克斯洛伐克全国工业总产值的三分之一，并占全国出口货物的近一半。捷克斯洛伐克现在差不多能够制造一切种类的机械、机器和设备，包括各种金属加工车床，成套的冶金设备，强大的电气装备、起重机、挖掘机、复杂的农业机器和精密机械等，捷克斯洛伐克工业的产品行销世界各国，享有很高声誉。
    捷克斯洛伐克在发展工业方面所获得的巨大成就，是同伟大的苏联对它的无私的援助，同它和各兄弟国家的经济合作分不开的。而这种成就，也对整个和平民主阵营的经济高涨作出了重要的贡献。
    我国同捷克斯洛伐克的友好合作关系，在一九四九年十月中华人民共和国成立、中捷两国建立起新的外交关系以后有了极大的发展。从一九五○年起，两国之间的贸易额一年比一年扩大。据最近统计，一九五五年中捷贸易额已比一九五○年增加了三倍半以上。同时，中捷两国的科学技术合作和文化交流，这些年来也日益密切。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党和捷克斯洛伐克政府的领袖们十分重视加强同中国人民的友好合作关系。捷克斯洛伐克人民敬爱的领袖、捷克斯洛伐克故总统哥特瓦尔德曾说过：应当尽一切力量，满足中国人民向我国提出的要求。这些年来，我国从捷克斯洛伐克得到成套的发电站、化学肥料工厂、制糖工厂和影片洗印工厂等的设备，以及其他许多采矿、冶金、建筑工业应用的机器设备，钢材、石油和交通器材等等。捷克斯洛伐克不仅供应我国以成套的工业设备，并且还在建设这些工厂时负责从勘察、设计、安装直到开工运转的全部工作。对于我国订货的生产任务，捷克斯洛伐克的工人都满怀热情地努力争取及时完成或提前完成。在我国某些工厂、企业中工作的捷克斯洛伐克专家，也都不辞劳苦地帮助我国工人和技术人员掌握使用现代化的机器设备，使他们很快地提高技术程度。
    捷克斯洛伐克对我国的这种帮助，对于我国完成国民经济的恢复工作和加速实行第一个五年计划，是一种有力的支持。同时，我国对捷克斯洛伐克供应的各种必需的工业原料、食品、肉类等，也有助于捷克斯洛伐克工业的顺利发展和人民生活的需要。中捷两国之间的这种兄弟般的合作，是和平民主阵营各国之间的新型国际关系的具体表现。这种合作加强了以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，并有助于世界和平事业的巩固。
    “捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会”在中国举办，是中捷两国友好合作关系进一步发展的标志。在展览会举办期间，陈列在展览会上的各种机器设备将进行实际的操作表演，中捷两国的工人和技术人员将进行技术交流活动，许多捷克斯洛伐克专家还要到各有关工厂企业去进行访问、座谈。同时，捷克斯洛伐克木偶剧团、舞蹈团和排球队也来到我国进行广泛的访问演出和比赛。这些都将大大增进中捷两国人民的友谊。
    这个展览会在北京展出以后，还要到我国其他城市去举办。我国广大的工人、农民、干部和各阶层的人民，将能够利用这个机会进行非常有益的参观学习。我们要学习勤劳、智慧的捷克斯洛伐克人民在发展工业和建设社会主义的斗争中所创造和积累起来的先进技术和丰富经验，并把学习所得运用到我国的社会主义建设事业中去。过去的事实已经证明，苏联和各人民民主国家在我国举办的各种展览会，在向我国人民介绍先进经验和促进我国人民同兄弟国家人民之间的友好合作方面，是有显著作用的。我们完全相信，“捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会”在我国也一定会获得巨大的成就。
