Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 25th. The second national conference of the India-China Friendship Association, which opened in Calcutta on the 21st, held a plenary session on the 23rd.

    The conference passed three resolutions based on the report submitted by its Political Committee.

    The resolution on the issue of international tension, proposed by Chatterjee, Speaker of the West Bengal Provincial Legislative Assembly, stated that the peace of Asia and the world depends on the unity of all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence put forward by the Prime Ministers of India and China. The resolution calls on all units of the India-China Friendship Association and other groups in India to participate in nationwide publicity on the Five Principles.

    The second resolution, proposed by Karanjia and seconded by Indian Member of Parliament Damodara Menon, called for the immediate return of Taiwan—which is an indivisible part of China, both historically and culturally—to China.

    The third resolution, proposed by Indian Member of Parliament Vaidya, called for the People's Republic of China to obtain its legitimate seat in the United Nations organization, replacing the representative of Chiang Kai-shek, who has no right to represent the Chinese people.

    The chairman of the conference, Dr. Pannikar, former Indian Ambassador to China, said in his speech that promoting India-China friendship is a great task. The friendship between the two countries is regarded as a basic principle of national policy. Pannikar suggested studying Chinese history, language, and literature, and emphasized the need to understand the Chinese people and their way of life.

    The conference also heard four other reports. The report on organizational issues by Indian Member of Parliament Chaturnarain Malaviya put forward a detailed plan for establishing India-China Friendship Association organizations throughout the country. Dr. Chatterjee, in his report on cultural relations, suggested that India and China send artists, musicians, students, and teachers to each other. The report on trade and economy by Dr. Gyan Chand emphasized the need to develop close and friendly economic relations between the two countries, and suggested a wide exchange of information and experience between India and China, especially on issues of economic construction and development. In his report on scientific and technological cooperation, Dr. Guha emphasized the need for scientific and technological cooperation between China and India.
