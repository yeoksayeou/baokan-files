    Use Comprehensive Cultivation Techniques to Prevent Potato Late Blight
  　Zhou Yiqiao
    Late blight is a disease that seriously endangers potatoes. In 1953, potato production in the Jinbei area of Shanxi Province was reduced by 40% due to late blight, resulting in a loss of more than 800 million jin of potatoes. In 1954, potato production in Hebei and Gansu provinces was reduced by 20% in mild cases and 60-70% in severe cases due to late blight. Due to the harm of late blight, some farmers in Hebei Province still dare not grow more potatoes this year.
    According to the results of experiments and research in various regions in recent years, comprehensive cultivation techniques can be used to prevent and reduce potato late blight. Comprehensive cultivation techniques include selecting disease-resistant varieties, adopting crop rotation, implementing vernalization treatment, early planting, high earthing-up, and cutting vines early before harvest. In 1954, the Nanmazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ying County, Shanxi Province, achieved a large-scale (181 mu) bumper harvest despite the severe occurrence of potato late blight in the local area, with an average yield of 1,448 jin per mu, which was much higher than that without comprehensive cultivation techniques.
    Now is the potato planting season, and potato-growing areas should select disease-resistant varieties and plant them as early as possible. Agricultural technology extension stations in potato-growing areas should also teach the masses techniques such as earthing-up during the potato growing season and cutting vines early before harvest in conjunction with planting.

    用综合栽培技术防止马铃薯晚疫病
  　周逸樵
    晚疫病是严重危害马铃薯的一种病害。一九五三年山西省晋北地区的马铃薯，因晚疫病减产百分之四十，损失马铃薯达八亿多斤；一九五四年河北、甘肃两省的马铃薯因晚疫病为害，轻的减产二成，重的减产六、七成。由于晚疫病为害，今年河北省有些农民还不敢多种马铃薯。
    根据几年来各地试验研究结果，采用综合栽培技术，可以防治和减轻马铃薯晚疫病。综合栽培技术，包括选用抗病品种、采取轮作、实行春化处理、提前播种、高培土和收获前提早割蔓。一九五四年山西省应县南马庄农业生产合作社，在当地马铃薯晚疫病严重发生的情况下，由于采用了综合栽培技术，仍然获得了大面积（一百八十一亩）的丰收，平均每亩产量高达一千四百四十八斤，比没有采用综合栽培技术的增产很多。
    目前正是马铃薯播种时期，种植马铃薯的地区应该尽可能选用抗病品种和提早播种。种植马铃薯地区的农业技术推广站，还应该结合播种，向群众传授马铃薯生长期的加高培土和收获前提早割蔓等技术。
