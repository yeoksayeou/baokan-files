Implementing a Short-Term Contract System Eliminates Work Stoppages
	Wen Guantong Li Xianming

	The agricultural production cooperative led by Zou Baojun in Ducha Village, Sixth District, Hejian County, Hebei Province, was established in the spring of 1954, with 15 member households and 45 laborers. In the autumn of that year, the cooperative expanded to 21 households, and the labor force increased to 66. After the start of spring plowing this year, the cooperative's labor organization was not yet established, and production was very chaotic. Some members could not find work, and their morale was low. The cooperative's management committee studied this situation and implemented a short-term contract system, which quickly overcame the chaotic production situation.

	Eliminating Members' Ideological Concerns

	Before implementing the contract system, the management committee first conducted publicity and discussion among the members and found that members had various attitudes towards contracting. Members who worked hard and well actively supported it. Members with weak labor power were indifferent, fearing that they would do less work and receive less grain in the future after contracting. Women members had more concerns. For example, some women members said, "The contract system benefits strong and skilled men, and women suffer." Members who did not work well resisted passively, saying, "Joining the cooperative means being one family, eating the same food, and doing the same work. Why distinguish between good and bad labor?" Some cadres were afraid that contracting would be troublesome and would reduce their work points, so they also took a passive attitude. In response to the above situation, the management committee held separate forums with members who had various ideological concerns, comparing the facts of temporary dispatch of work and contracting, allowing everyone to weigh the advantages and disadvantages and recognize the benefits of implementing the contract system. In the autumn of 1954, the cooperative adopted the method of temporary dispatch and daily work recording. It usually took seven work days to harvest three and a half mu of peanuts, but it actually took 17.5 work days, wasting 10.5 work days. This spring, a piece-rate contract system was implemented for chopping inch-long grass for livestock. It was planned to use 30 work days for 3,700 jin of grass, but it only took 18 work days. After conducting comparative education using the above facts, the vast majority of members agreed to implement the contract system. The party member cadres in the cooperative then divided the work and educated the weak and individual lazy members, focusing on explaining the principle that only active labor can improve production, criticizing the wrong idea of ​​wanting to do less work and earn more work points, and inspiring the labor enthusiasm of such members. Zou Xinzhong, a member who had never been active in work, said, "In the past, there was no distinction between good and bad labor in the cooperative, and things were distributed the same way. Now that the contract system is implemented, those who work more get more. It is impossible not to work actively anymore, I must work harder."

	Fully Prepare for Contracting

	On the basis of the members unanimously agreeing to implement the contract system, the management committee made full preparations for contracting. First, it registered the labor force, livestock, and farm implements in the cooperative. When registering the labor force, it distinguished between gender, age, strength, expertise, and skill level. Livestock and farm implements were also classified and ranked. In this way, the leading cadres had a clear idea, and when organizing the use of labor, they could "use talents accordingly." When matching livestock and farm implements, they could also appropriately separate the strong and weak, good and bad. Second, labor organizations were established. According to the principle of unified allocation and free combination, the entire labor force of the cooperative was divided into two production teams. (Editor's note: For small cooperatives with more than a dozen households like this, it may be considered not to set up production teams, so as to avoid too many levels and inconvenience to leadership.) Each team was divided into three production groups. At the same time, livestock and farm implements were reasonably allocated according to the needs of each production team and group. The following points were noted when forming production teams and groups: (1) Promoting democracy. Production team leaders and production group leaders were fully discussed and democratically elected by all members of the team and group. The members were very satisfied with this, saying, "It is also energetic to work with the leaders elected by themselves." (2) Party and League members and production experts in the cooperative were evenly distributed, so that each team and group had a certain leadership backbone and production experts. (3) In order to take care of the convenience of the members and the good matching of male and female full and half labor in each group, the whole family was arranged in one group as much as possible. After the labor organization was established, the management committee then absorbed production team leaders, group leaders, experienced old farmers, etc. to establish an evaluation group to evaluate the work point standards for various farm work in the cooperative. When evaluating work points, the evaluation group first made a draft, which was repeatedly discussed and revised by the members, and finally finalized. When assessing work points, attention was paid to the difference between technical work and general work, and light work and heavy work. For example, for transporting manure, the normal standard is four points per cart, and four carts a day (a round trip of eight li) can earn a total of sixteen points (every ten points is one working day). According to two people per cart, the driver gets 8.8 points and the loader gets 7.2 points. For example, chopping grass is heavy work, and the normal standard is 400 jin per knife (two people) per day. In order to take care of the fatigue, it is stipulated that 380 jin should be chopped per day, and each person is credited with one work point, and exceeding the specified amount is rewarded. For example, mashing manure is light work, and the normal standard is seven carts per person per day for one work point, then two more carts are added to nine carts for one work point. Cleaning the pigsty is dirty work and heavy work. The normal standard is seven carts per person per day, then two carts are reduced to five carts for one work point. (Editor's note: Work points for heavy and difficult work can be set higher, and work points for light and easy work can be set lower. This can also reward labor. Lowering or raising the quota is not a good method for calculating labor.) In this way, more work gets more, technology is rewarded, and the phenomenon of members rushing for light work and avoiding heavy work, and fighting for clean work and avoiding dirty work can be avoided.

	Conduct "Three Calculations" to Contract Work by Task

	On the basis of making good preparations for contracting, the management committee led the members to conduct "three calculations" - calculating farm work, calculating labor force, and calculating time - and specifically arranged for contracting. In addition to the main tasks of mashing and transporting coarse manure, chopping dry grass, and harrowing white land, the farm work that needs to be done in the cooperative at present also includes dismantling seven old houses for soil to increase fertilizer; in addition, there are odd jobs such as pulling soil and plastering houses. These farm tasks need to be completed within ten days, so this contracting period is stipulated to be ten days. Then, these farm tasks are contracted to each production group respectively. The cooperative has a total of 66 laborers (full and half labor), and this farm work only requires 30. In addition to six people who are sick, there are 30 laborers who have no work to do. In order to ensure that members have work to do and income, a nine-person firewood gathering group and a five-person peanut seed peeling group were also organized. In addition, 16 women are rushing to do needlework to prepare for participating in field production in the next stage. In addition, special personnel are assigned to be responsible for livestock feeding and farm implement management. In this way, everything in the cooperative is taken care of, and everyone has work to do.

	Pay Attention to Solving New Problems

	After the implementation of the contract system, the members' enthusiasm for labor soared unprecedentedly, but some cadres developed the idea of ​​taking a breath of relief. They believed that since the contract was implemented, everyone was responsible for everything, and it didn't matter whether they managed it or not, so they relaxed their leadership. In order to save time and earn more work points, the members had the rough phenomenon of doing work quickly without seeking quality. For example, when members Zou Chunting and others chopped grass, the original stipulation was to chop 380 jin per day, with five-fen-long grass stalks, and each person would be credited with one work point. They chopped 500 jin a day, with eight-fen-long grass stalks, exceeding the quantity and reducing the quality. When member Zou Zhenqi transported manure, he did not take care of the livestock's fatigue, and hitched the cart before the livestock had eaten enough. It was originally stipulated to transport four carts a day, and he transported five carts, which resulted in exhaustion of the livestock.

	After discovering these problems, the management committee promptly launched a discussion among the members, adjusted the time and quality standards for completing various farm tasks, and also stipulated that the cadres should specifically lead each group and members should supervise and inspect each other to ensure that the tasks are completed on time and with quality. Finally, it was also stipulated that a summary and evaluation should be conducted after each contracting period, and members and production teams (groups) who work well, work diligently, and take good care of public property should be commended and rewarded, and those who do not work well and damage the public interests of members should be criticized or appropriately reduced work points. In this way, the problem of small-scale contracting was completely solved.

	Eliminating Work Stoppages

	Since the implementation of the short-term contract system, the phenomenon of work stoppages in the cooperative has been completely eliminated. Before the contracting, only 39 of the 66 laborers in the cooperative could regularly participate in labor, and the rest often had no work to do. After the contracting, except for six who were sick, all the members were put into production. The labor efficiency of the members has been significantly improved. Before contracting, member Zou Xicai chopped grass. He didn't start work in the morning, and he stopped work before noon, and the two of them only chopped 300 jin of grass a day. Now, they start work before dawn, and the two of them chop 450 jin a day. Member Zou Xizhen (old member) only earned 84 work points in 1954, but after contracting, she earned 23 work points in less than a month. Women members have also broken the old habit of not wanting to participate in field production. Of the 34 female laborers in the cooperative, there were originally 25 who did not participate in production, but now they have all been put into production.

    实行短期包工制消除了窝工现象
    文冠通　李先铭
    河北省河间县六区都插村邹保均领导的农业生产合作社是在一九五四年春天建立的，共有社员十五户，四十五个劳动力。当年秋季社扩大到二十一户，劳力增加到六十六个。今年的春耕生产开始后，社的劳动组织还没建立好，生产很混乱，有些社员找不到活干，情绪不安。社务管理委员会研究了这个情况，实行了短期包工制，就迅速克服了生产混乱现象。
      解除社员思想顾虑
    在实行包工前，社务管理委员会首先在社员中进行了宣传酝酿，发觉社员对包工有各种不同的态度。劳动多劳动好的社员积极拥护。劳力弱的社员怕包工后自己做活少，将来分粮少，表示冷淡。妇女社员顾虑更多，如有的妇女社员说：“包工制是身体强、技术高的男人沾光，就是妇女倒霉。”劳动不好的社员消极抵抗，他们说：“入了社就是一家人，吃一家的饭，作一家的活，还分什么劳动好坏。”有的干部怕包工费事使自己少赚工分，也抱消极态度。管理委员会针对以上情况，分别召集有各种思想顾虑的社员开了座谈会，用临时派工和包工的事实对比，让大家权衡利害，认识实行包工制的好处。这个社一九五四年秋天做活时，是采用临时派工、按天记工的办法。有三亩半花生按通常情况七个工就能刨完，结果却用了十七个半工，浪费了十个半工。今年春天给牲口铡寸草实行按件记工的包工办法，三千七百斤草原计划用工三十个，结果只用了十八个工。经过举出上述事实进行对比教育以后，绝大多数社员都同意了实行包工制。社内党员干部又分工对劳力弱的和个别懒惰的社员进行了教育，着重说明只有积极劳动，才能搞好生产的道理，批判了那些想少作活多挣工分的错误思想，激发了这类社员的劳动积极性。从来干活不积极的社员邹新中说：“过去社内劳动不分多少好坏，一样分东西，现在实行包工是多劳多得，再不积极劳动是不行了，我一定要多干活。”
    充分作好包工前的准备工作
    在社员一致同意实行包工制的基础上，管理委员会进行了充分的包工准备工作。首先是对社内劳力、牲畜、农具分别进行了登记。在登记劳力时，分清了性别、年龄、劳力强弱、有何专长和技术高低等情况。对牲口、农具也进行了分类排队。这样，领导干部心中有了底，在组织使用劳力时，就可以作到“量才使用”。搭配牲口农具时，也可作到强弱、好坏适当分开。其次，是建立劳动组织。按照统一配备，自由结合的原则，把全社劳力划分了两个生产队。（编者按：像这样十多户的小社，可考虑不设生产队，以免层次多，领导不便。）每队下设三个生产小组。同时，又根据各生产队、生产小组的需要对牲口农具作了合理的分配。在编生产队、组时，注意了以下几点：（一）发扬民主。生产队长、生产小组组长都是经过本队、组全体社员充分酝酿、民主选举的。社员们对这一点很满意，说：“跟着自己选举的领导人干活也有劲。”
  （二）社内党、团员和生产能手搭配均匀，使各队、组都有一定的领导骨干和生产能手。（三）为了照顾社员方便和各组男女整半劳力搭配得好，把一家人尽量编在一组。建立好劳动组织以后，管理委员会接着吸收了生产队长、组长、有经验的老农等建立评议小组，评定了社内各种农活的工分标准。在评定工分时，先由评议小组做出草案，经过社员反复讨论修订，最后定案。在评工分时，注意了技术活和一般活、轻活和重活的差别。如送粪，通常情况每车定为四分，一天送四车（往返一趟八里路）共得十六分（每十分为一个劳动日），按每辆车两个人，驶车的得八分八，随车装卸的得七分二。如铡草是重活，通常情况每把刀（两个人）每天铡四百斤，为了照顾劳累，则规定每天铡三百八十斤，每人记一个工，超过规定的作为奖励。如捣粪是轻松活，通常每人每天捣七车为一个工，则加捣两车以九车记一个工。掏猪圈是件脏活，又是重活，通常每人每天能掏七车，则减少两车以五车记一个工。（编者按：重活、难做的活工分可以订得高些，轻活、容易做的活工分可以订低些，这同样可以奖励劳动，把定额降低或提高不是记算劳动的一种好方法。）这样，就作到了多劳多得，奖励技术，并可避免发生社员抢轻活躲重活、争净活避脏活的现象。
    进行“三算”按活包工
    在作好了包工准备工作的基础上，管理委员会领导社员进行了“三算”——算农活、算劳力、算时间——具体按排包工。当前社内需要作的农活除捣送粗粪、铡干草、耙白地等主要活计以外，还要拆七间旧房土来增加肥料；此外，还有拉土、抹房等零活。这些农活需要在十天以内完成，因此这段包工期规定为十天。接着就把这些农活分别包给各生产小组。全社共有劳力六十六个（整半劳力），这段农活只需要三十个。除了六个人有病，还剩下三十个劳力没有活干。为了作到社员都有活干，有收入，又组织了一个九人的拾柴小组，五人的剥花生种籽小组。还有十六个妇女赶做针线活，准备下段参加田间生产。此外，牲畜喂养，农具管理都确定了专人负责。这样，就作到社内事事有人管，人人有活干。
      注意解决新问题
      实行包工以后，社员们劳动热情空前高涨起来，但是有些社干部却产生了松一口气的思想。他们认为实行了包工，每件事都有人负责了，管不管不要紧了，于是就放松了领导。社员们为了赶时间，多挣工分，发生了做活贪快不求好的粗糙现象。如社员邹春廷等在铡草时原规定每天铡三百八十斤，草秸五分长每人记一个工，他们一天铡了五百斤，草秸八分长，超过了数量，降低了质量。社员邹振起送粪时不照顾牲口劳累，没等牲口吃饱就套车，路上打着牲口跑。原规定每天送四车，他送了五车，结果累坏了牲口。
    管理委员会发觉这些问题以后，及时发动社员进行了讨论，调整了各种农活完成的时间和质量标准，又规定了社干部分工具体领导各组，社员相互监督检查等制度，保证按时、按质量完成任务。最后还规定了每段包工结束后总结评比一次，对劳动好、作活认真、爱护公共财物的社员和生产队（组）要进行表扬奖励，对劳动不好损害社员公共利益的要给予批评或适当减少工分。这样一来，小段包工的问题就完全解决了。
    消除了窝工现象
    自从实行了短期包工制以后，社里的窝工现象完全消除了。包工前社内六十六个劳动力，只有三十九个能经常参加劳动，其余的经常没有活干。包工后除六个有病的以外，全体社员都投入了生产。社员劳动效率显著提高了。社员邹希才包工前铡草，早晨不动手，不等晌午就歇工，两人每天只铡三百斤草。现在不等天明就动手，两人每天铡四百五十斤。社员邹希珍（老社员）一九五四年一年只挣了八十四个工，包工后不到一个月就挣了二十三个工。妇女社员也打破了原来不愿参加田间生产的旧习惯，全社女劳力三十四个，原有二十五个不参加生产，现在都投入了生产。
