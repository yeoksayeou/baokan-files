Under the Pretext of "Everything Must Adapt to Modern Equipment"
　　Méi Xīnshēng

Chongqing 507 Power Plant is one of the automated and mechanized thermal power plants that the Soviet Union helped China build anew and has been officially in production for nearly a year. In this year, the selfless labor of the workers has accumulated a lot of wealth for the socialist construction of the motherland. However, there are still quite a few people who, relying on the signboard of a modern thermal power plant, squander and waste people's property wantonly under the pretext of "everything must adapt to modern equipment."

Here, what some cadres feel most happy about is: making budgets and plans, the more the better. After they smoothly pass the "leadership review," the supply department "accepts everything that comes and responds to every request," and finally the finance department makes a note in the ledger. With such "coordinated cooperation," spending money is easy.

The budget for the opening ceremony of the plant in April 1954 was 40,000 yuan, of which the site layout alone was 10,000 yuan. A large number of red flags, colored silk, colored cloth, light bulbs and various appliances all had to be bought new. When the higher authorities reviewed and approved it, they asked: "Can the expenditure be reduced a bit?" The answer was: This is not enough, we still need money there, and our factory will need these things for meetings in the future! In fact, it cost more than 50,000 yuan. 13,000 commemorative badges were made, and one-third of them are still left unused; 100 palace lanterns were made, but only eight were used; a total of 580 zhang of cloth and silk were bought; nearly two kilometers long, as for the expenditure on tobacco, alcohol and other items, it is too numerous to mention. Look at an expenditure of the 507 Plant for entertaining guests! They specially equipped more than 50 receptionists and cooks, bought 35 sets of leather sofas, more than 80 sofa covers, two billiard tables, a set of Western tableware for 80 people, a set of dance instruments, 13 radios, and also bought more than 2,000 yuan of canned food and wine. The opening ceremony is a happy event and should be celebrated, but the above-mentioned practice is too extravagant. How to reimburse such a large expenditure? Part of it was listed as "administrative expenses," and the accounting department entered it into the ledger, and everything was fine.

When various branch plants prepare their budgets, they all hold the idea that "507 is such a big plant, we can buy whatever we want," and they buy whatever they want, regardless of the quantity or the price. They do not care about the financial cost of the enterprise and accumulate and waste a large amount of various raw materials and articles. The chemistry plant bought enough pure iodine for 600 years and enough potassium permanganate for 200 years; a 1,100 yuan precision balance that can measure the weight increase after writing on a piece of white paper down to one-tenth of a milligram, but this balance was locked in the warehouse as soon as it was bought, sentenced to life imprisonment; the repair plant bought a 3,000 yuan gasoline pump, which was rarely used; the administrative section printed enough bath tickets for 15 years at a time, but now bathing does not require tickets at all; the supply section did not ask the warehouse and bought more than 7 tons of steel bars according to the "plan," but in fact the warehouse still has 30 tons of the same steel bars in stock. He ZhengNan, the deputy director of operation in the turbine plant, said: "It's okay if there's too much, it's okay if it's overstocked, as long as it's useful." The production and education plant made a budget of 150 sets of work clothes for sewing trainees, 16 yuan per set, and the deputy director approved it according to "there is this expenditure in the training fee," but the warehouse still had more than 400 sets of brand-new white work clothes that were not utilized. As a result, they made silk-finished khaki work clothes at 17 yuan per set. When the higher authorities inquired about this matter, the factory director said: "How could there be such a thing! I don't believe it!" But the head of the administrative section said plausibly: "This is budgeted." According to the salesman of Chongqing Department Store, the silk-finished khaki work clothes at 17 yuan per set are "the best quality among the work clothes of workers in the city!" Because they are made of silk-finished khaki cloth, some workers are reluctant to wear them when they go to work and treat them as "formal clothes" for going to the city on Sundays. The requirements for the design of various large and small projects are also very high. For example, the electrical plant proposed to add a water level indicator signal device project in a certain place, all using cables, requiring 25,000 yuan, but it would actually cost only more than 6,000 yuan to use lead-covered wire.

In addition, the waste of coal, water, and electricity used in daily life is even more alarming. In January, non-production electricity and lighting expenses accounted for more than 58% of administrative expenses. Each office has two to four 200-watt light bulbs, and no one manages the electricity used for dormitories and street lights, and street lights are also lit during the day. The lights in the dormitories can be as bright as you want, and they can be lit for as long as you want. People can arbitrarily use boiling water for washing clothes, bathing, and family cooking. A water pipe in a toilet was broken, and the water flowed for more than half a month without anyone caring about it.

In the opinion book of the anti-waste exhibition recently held in the plant, the workers unanimously proposed that: When the people of the whole country are increasing production and practicing economy in various aspects to accumulate funds for socialist construction, our plant is wasting a lot of state funds, which is really painful! They unanimously hope that the leadership will conduct strict inspections and correct them in time.

    在“一切要同现代化的设备相适应”的借口下
    梅欣生
    重庆五○七电力厂是苏联帮助我国新建设的自动化机械化的火力发电厂之一，正式投入生产将近一年了。在这一年当中，工人们的忘我劳动，为祖国社会主义建设积累了不少资财。但是，还有为数不少的人，凭着现代化火力发电厂的招牌，在“一切要同现代化的设备相适应”的借口下，肆无忌惮地挥霍、浪费人民财产。
    在这里，某些干部感到最痛快的是：造预算、做计划，数量多多益善。他们顺利地通过了“领导审查”这一关以后，供应部门就“来者不拒，有求必应”，最后到财务部门记一笔账就行了。在这样的“协同配合”下，花费起来倒是得心应手。
    这个厂一九五四年四月举办开车典礼的预算是四万元，其中场地布置一项就是一万元。大批的红旗、彩绸、彩布、灯泡和各种器具全要买新的，上级审查批准的时候问过：“开支能缩减些吗？”回答是：这里不够，那里还要用钱，将来我们厂里开会还用得着这些东西！实际上花了足足五万元有余。建厂纪念章做了一万三千个，至今还剩了三分之一没处发；宫灯做了一百个，只用了八个；布、绸等共买了五百八十丈；将近两公里长，至于烟酒及其他花费更不胜枚举。请看五○七厂招待客人的一笔开支吧！他们专门配备了五十多个招待员和炊事员，买了三十五套皮沙发，八十多个沙发套，两台弹子，一套可供八十人用的西餐用具，一套跳舞乐器，十三部收音机，还买了两千多元的罐头和酒。开车典礼是一件喜事，应该庆祝一下，但是，像上面这种做法，实在太铺张了。开支这样大，怎样报销呢？其中的一部分被列入“行政管理费”，会计科一入账，就万事大吉。
    各分场编制预算时都抱着“五○七这样大的厂，要什么都买得来”的想法，想要啥，就买啥，不管数目多少，价钱高低，他们不关心企业的财务成本，大量积压和浪费了各种原材料、物品。化学场买来了够用六百年的纯碘，够用二百年的高锰酸钾；价值一千一百元多精细到能衡量一张白纸写上字以后增加了多少重量的十万分之一的天平，而这个天平一买来就关入仓库，判了无期徒刑；修配场买了一部三千元的汽油泵浦，很少用过；行政科一次印了够十五年用的洗澡票，而现在洗澡根本不用票；供应科不问库房，照着“计划”买了七吨多钢筋，其实库房还积存着同样的钢筋三十吨。透平场运行副主任贺正南说：“多了就多了，积压就积压，只要是有用的。”生产教育场造了缝制培训人员工作服一百五十套的预算，每套十六元，报上去，副厂长按照“培训费里有这笔开支”批准了，而仓库里还存了四百多套白色全新工作服却不利用。结果，他们却按十七元一套做了丝光卡叽布工作服。当上级查问此事时，厂长说：“那会有这样的事！我不相信！”行政科长却振振有词地说：“这是有预算的。”十七元一套的丝光卡叽工作服，据重庆市百货公司售货员说：“这是全市工人工作服中质量最好的哩！”因为是丝光卡叽布做的，有些工人上班的时候，舍不得穿，把它当做是星期天进城用的“礼服”。在各项大、小工程的设计上，要求也是很高的。如电气场提出某地加装水位指示信号器工程，全部使用电缆，需要二万五千元，其实只用六千多元的铅皮线就行了。
    此外日常生活所用煤、水、电的浪费更是惊人。一月份非生产用的电力、电光的开支占去行政管理费用开支的百分之五十八以上。每间办公室都有二百度的灯泡两至四个，宿舍、路灯用电无人管理，白天也点着路灯。宿舍里的灯想点多亮就点多亮，想亮多久就亮多久。人们洗衣、洗澡、家属煮饭等都可任意用开水。有一个厕所里的水管坏了，水流了半个多月无人过问。
    在最近该厂举行的反浪费展览会的意见簿上，工人们不约而同地提出：当全国人民为了建设社会主义从各方面增产节约，积累资金的时候，我们厂却浪费了国家大量的资金，真令人痛心！他们一致希望领导上进行严格的检查，并及时纠正。
