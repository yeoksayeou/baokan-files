Memorandum from the Delegation of the China Fisheries Association to the Delegation of the Japan-China Fisheries Council

　　In the waters bounded by a line connecting the points at 34 degrees north latitude, 123 degrees east longitude, 34 degrees north latitude, 124 degrees east longitude, 33 degrees north latitude, 124 degrees east longitude, and 33 degrees north latitude, 123 degrees east longitude in the central Yellow Sea, there is a dense concentration of small yellow croaker. Every year, during the four months of October, November, and January, February of the following year, China regularly has about 80 pairs of motorized vessels operating in this fishing ground. During the same period, Japan also has a large number of fishing vessels operating in this fishing ground. Therefore, during the negotiation process, the delegation of the China Fisheries Association, based on the principle of rational arrangement in fishing grounds where Chinese and Japanese fishing vessels compete fiercely, repeatedly proposed that this sea area be designated as a fishing zone and that the number of vessels operating by both sides be reasonably limited in the above-mentioned fishing ground and during the peak fishing season.
　　Your delegation stated that about 50 pairs of Japanese fishing vessels operate in this sea area, and that there would be no fierce competition between Chinese and Japanese fishing vessels, and therefore disagreed with designating this sea area as a fishing zone. At the same time, your delegation expressed its willingness to consider the interests of the Chinese fishing industry in this sea area, guarantee not to monopolize the fishing grounds, and not to exclude the operation of Chinese fishing vessels. Based on the above situation, our delegation, based on the desire for friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese fishing industries, and in order to promote an early agreement between China and Japan on fishery issues in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea, believes that it is acceptable to temporarily not designate the above-mentioned sea area as a fishing zone.
　　In order to protect the fishery resources of this sea area and to avoid fishery disputes, we hope that your delegation will pay attention to our delegation's views on this sea area, take appropriate measures to prevent your fishing vessels from excluding Chinese fishing vessels in the above-mentioned fishing ground, and notify your fishing vessel crew members to earnestly abide by Annex II of the agreement signed by the Chinese and Japanese non-governmental fishery organizations this time, "Regulations on Maintaining the Order of Fishing Vessel Operations," in order to enhance the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese fishing industries.

　　Respectfully to Mr. Shichida Suekichi, Head of the Delegation of the Japan-China Fisheries Council, Mr. Murayama Satarou, Deputy Head, and Mr. Yamazaki Kininosuke, Deputy Head

　　Delegation of the China Fisheries Association
　　Head: Yang Yu

    中国渔业协会代表团致日本日中渔业协议会代表团的备忘录
    在黄海中部以北纬三四度、东经一二三度之点，北纬三四度、东经一二四度之点，北纬三三度、东经一二四度之点，北纬三三度、东经一二三度之点连结线的海域内为小黄鱼密集场所。每年十月、十一月和翌年一月、二月等四个月期间，中国经常有八十对左右机轮在这个渔场作业，在同一期间内日本也有大批渔轮在这个渔场作业，因此，中国渔业协会代表团在谈判过程中，根据在中日双方渔轮竞争激烈的渔场实行合理安排的原则，曾一再提议这个海域区划为一个渔区，在上述渔场和盛渔期间内，合理地限定双方作业船数。
    贵方代表团曾表明在该海域作业的日本渔轮为五十对左右，中日双方渔轮不会发生激烈竞争等理由，不同意将该海域区划为一个渔区。同时，贵方代表团表示愿意在该海域内考虑中国渔业界的利益，保证不垄断渔场，不排挤中国渔轮的作业。根据上述情况，我方代表团基于和日本渔业界友好合作的愿望，为了促使中日双方关于在黄海、东海的渔业问题早日达成协议，认为可以暂时不将上述海域划分为一个渔区。
    为了保护该海域的渔业资源，为了避免渔业纠纷，我方希望贵方代表团注意我方代表团对该海域的见解，采取适当措施，防止贵方渔轮在上述渔场排挤中国渔轮情事的发生，并通告贵方渔轮船员切实遵守此次中日双方民间渔业团体签订的协定附件二、“关于维持渔船作业秩序的规定”，以期增进中日两国渔业界的友好和合作。
      此致日本国日中渔业协议会代表团七田末吉团长村山佐太郎副团长山崎喜之助副团长中国渔业协会代表团
