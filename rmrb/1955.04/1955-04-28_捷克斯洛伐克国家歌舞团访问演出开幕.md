Xinhua News Agency, April 27th: More than one hundred Czechoslovak artists who came to our country for a visit have begun to perform their national-style music and dance for Beijing audiences. On the evening of April 27th, the Czechoslovak State Song and Dance Ensemble held the opening ceremony of their performance tour in China at the Tianqiao Theater.

Those attending the opening ceremony included Shen Yanbing, Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, Vice Ministers Zheng Zhenduo and Zhang Zhixiang, Vice Mayor of Beijing Feng Jiping, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Yang Hansheng, Director of the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Liaison Hong Shen, and more than one thousand people from the capital's literary, drama, film, music, dance, and art circles.

Also attending the opening ceremony were Šmíd, Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Czechoslovak Embassy in China, and embassy staff.

At the beginning of the opening ceremony, Zheng Zhenduo, Vice Minister of Culture, delivered the opening speech. He said: "The Czechoslovak State Song and Dance Ensemble, with its correct direction in organizing and disseminating folk art, and with its performances and creations that are ideological, combative, and highly artistic, has added even more brilliance to Czechoslovakia's rich artistic treasures. Their performances will provide Chinese artists with much helpful assistance."

Then, Dubovský, the head of the Czechoslovak State Song and Dance Ensemble, spoke. He expressed the love and friendship of all members of the song and dance ensemble to the Chinese people. He said that they would use the art of all ethnic groups in Czechoslovakia to express their respect to the Chinese people, and they excitedly hoped that the performances in China would further promote mutual understanding and cultural exchange between the people of China and Czechoslovakia.

After the opening ceremony, the artists of the song and dance ensemble performed more than twenty musical and dance programs.

The vast majority of the performance programs were beautiful folk music and dances from various parts of Czechoslovakia that have been organized and processed by the song and dance ensemble. For example, "Don't Knock on the Window, Don't Knock on the Window" is a Czech folk song, "Dance, Dance!" is a Slovak folk song, and "Strawberry" is a Moravian love song. The "Agricultural Dance" in the dances is a women's dance from central Slovakia, describing the field work from sowing to harvesting, expressing the hard work and the joy of harvest. "Masque Dance" is a festival dance of the people of southern Czech, with actors wearing various interesting costumes, and the dance is full of briskness and humor. "May Day Dance" is a newly created mass dance, which vividly depicts the happy life and festive joy of young men and women in the new society. The artists of the song and dance ensemble also performed the dance drama "The Master and the Ghost" adapted from folk mythology. This program expresses the working people's ruthless satire and hatred of the feudal rulers. Many programs were re-performed at the request of the audience.

The artists of the song and dance ensemble also performed the Chinese programs "Long Live Mao Zedong," "People of the World, One Heart," and "Red Silk Dance," which were warmly welcomed by the audience.
