Self-Criticism Regarding Errors in Hog Procurement
Xiao Zhanhua, Deputy Director of the Hubei Provincial Department of Commerce

On January 26th, the People's Daily criticized the Hubei Provincial Food Company's "kao cao system" (which involves starving farmers' hogs for several hours before purchase to empty their stomachs; during the "kao cao" time, the hogs are constantly driven around to excrete feces and reduce weight, and some are even beaten with sticks to test their "reflexes") and other erroneous practices in hog procurement. This criticism is correct and timely. We accept this criticism and have abolished the "kao cao system" throughout the province, and are continuing to study how to improve hog procurement work.

In November of last year, the Hubei Provincial Food Company convened its first provincial-level storage and transportation section (division) chiefs conference. At the meeting, many units reported that the losses from purchasing hogs with full stomachs were too great, and that most farmers had not yet changed their habit of selling hogs with full stomachs. State-owned commercial enterprises could not adopt the private merchants' method of estimating weight and deducting from the scale. Therefore, the "kao cao system" was proposed and affirmed in the conference summary as the main method to prevent the purchase of hogs with full stomachs. Although the Hubei Provincial Department of Commerce sent cadres to participate in the meeting, due to the leadership's failure to promptly convene a report, the situation and existing problems of the meeting were not fully understood, and when the meeting summary was sent to the Department of Commerce, we did not review it in detail and forwarded it. Therefore, the erroneous practice of the "kao cao system" was implemented in various places. Later, when the "Hubei Trade Bulletin" published this summary, although it pointed out that "regarding the historical habit of farmers selling hogs with full stomachs, we must first start with political and ideological education, and not treat it as a purely technical problem. We should gradually change their old habit of selling hogs with full stomachs as farmers' socialist ideological awareness continues to improve," it did not criticize the "kao cao system."

The implementation of the erroneous "kao cao system" not only increased the trouble for the masses of farmers in selling hogs, delayed the masses' production time, damaged the interests of the masses, and caused dissatisfaction among the masses, and to a certain extent affected the production enthusiasm of the masses, but also greatly affected the procurement of hogs, and thus affected the completion of the state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives' market supply and export allocation tasks. Therefore, this erroneous practice is neither beneficial to the masses nor to the country.

This error is a reflection of our weak mass viewpoint and unclear service to production viewpoint, as well as a reflection of capitalist business ideology. From the perspective of work style, we have not shown enough concern for the masses, and we have not been cautious enough in dealing with problems. We did not conduct thorough and repeated studies of the advantages and disadvantages of the "kao cao system" before approving and forwarding the meeting summary of the Provincial Food Company carelessly. Afterwards, we did not promptly organize inspections, discover and correct errors. This is a manifestation of serious bureaucracy. From the perspective of ideological methods, this is a subjective and one-sided way of thinking. These errors are serious.

Through this self-examination, we have further realized the great significance of doing a good job in commercial work, and also realized that our policy and ideological level and leadership methods are not yet compatible with the tasks we undertake. Therefore, we are determined to strengthen our study in the future, improve our policy and ideological level, establish a firm mass viewpoint, overcome capitalist business ideology, improve our leadership methods and work style, and better serve production and consumers.

    对于收购毛猪中的错误做法的检讨
    湖北省商业厅副厅长  萧占华
    一月二十六日，人民日报批评了湖北省食品公司在收购毛猪中所实行的“考槽制”（就是把农民赶来出售的猪，饿上几个钟头，以免肚子里有食物；在考槽时间内，经常赶猪走动，使猪排出粪便，减轻体重，有的甚至用棍子打猪，看猪的“反射性能”）等错误作法，这个批评是正确的，及时的。我们接受这一批评，已在全省内废除了“考槽制”，并继续研究如何改进收购毛猪工作。
    湖北省食品公司去年十一月召开了第一届全省储运课（股）长会议。会上，不少单位反映收购饱食大肚猪（即饱肚猪）损失太大，而目前大部分农民尚未改变出售饱槽猪的习惯，国营商业又不能袭用私商估重除秤的办法，于是提出了“考槽制”，并在会议总结中肯定为防止收进饱槽猪的主要办法。湖北省商业厅虽曾派干部参加了会议，但因领导上没有及时召集汇报，对会议进行的情况和存在问题不够了解，而会议总结送到商业厅后，我们没有详加审阅即予批转，所以“考槽制”这一错误作法也就在各地实行起来。后来，“湖北贸易通讯”上刊登这个总结时，虽曾指出“对于农民出售饱槽猪的历史习惯，必须首先从政治思想教育着手，不能只作为技术问题来处理，应随着农民的社会主义思想觉悟的不断提高，逐步改变其出售饱槽猪的旧习惯”，但对“考槽制”也没有给以批判。
    推行错误的“考槽制”，不但增加了农民群众出售毛猪的麻烦，耽误了群众的生产时间，损害了群众的利益，造成群众的不满，并在一定程度上影响了群众的生产情绪，同时也在很大程度上影响了毛猪的收购，并因而影响到国营商业和合作社对市场的供应和出口调拨任务的完成，因此这种错误作法既不利于群众也不利于国家。
    这一错误，正是我们群众观点薄弱，为生产服务的观点不明确的反映，也是资本主义经营思想的反映。从工作作风上来检查，我们关心群众既不够，处理问题又不慎重，没有切实负责地反复研究“考槽制”的利弊，就马马虎虎地批转了省食品公司的会议总结，事后又没有及时组织检查，及时发现和纠正错误，这正是严重的官僚主义的表现。从思想方法上来检查，这正是主观的、片面的思想方法，这些错误是严重的。
    通过这次检查，我们进一步认识到作好商业工作的重大意义，也体会到我们的政策思想水平和领导方法还不能同我们所担负的任务相适应。因此，决心今后加强学习，提高政策思想水平，树立坚强的群众观点，克服资本主义经营思想，改善领导方法和工作作风，更好地为生产与消费者服务。
