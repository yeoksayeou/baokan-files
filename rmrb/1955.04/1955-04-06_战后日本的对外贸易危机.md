    Post-War Japanese Foreign Trade Crisis
　　Du Bo
    Since the end of the war, Japan's economic development has been in an abnormal state. Although Japan's industrial production has exceeded pre-war levels, its economic crisis is becoming increasingly serious. From March to July 1954, Japan's industrial production fell by 17.6 percent; however, between July 1953 and July 1954, Japanese inventories increased by 42.4 percent. These difficulties in production and sales have led to the shrinking or closure of many industrial and commercial enterprises, and a large number of workers have lost their jobs. In the past year or so, one-third of Japan's coal mines have closed down, and more than 100,000 coal miners have become unemployed. Currently, the number of unemployed and semi-employed people in Japan has increased to 13 million. Even Japanese political and business figures cannot but admit that Japan is under the threat of a serious economic crisis.
    The main reason for Japan's severe economic difficulties is that the United States, after the war, used its position as an occupying power to force Japan's economic militarization to serve its aggressive policies, while forcing Japan to implement a so-called embargo against peaceful and democratic countries, making the Japanese economy unilaterally dependent on the United States and destroying Japan's traditional foreign trade relations.
    Foreign trade is of particular significance to the development of the Japanese economy. Because Japan does not produce enough food and must rely on exporting industrial products to import food from abroad; and its developed industry must also rely on importing important raw materials and exporting a large number of manufactured goods to maintain itself. For example, all the cotton and wool used by Japan's main industry, the textile industry, relies on imports, and most of the products are sold abroad. Most of the iron ore and coking coal used in the ferrous metallurgy industry depends on foreign countries. If Japan cannot conduct normal trade with foreign countries, its domestic economic life will be completely paralyzed.
    Before World War II, China was one of the main countries trading with Japan. In the first few years after the war, although it had been somewhat obstructed by the United States, Sino-Japanese trade had recovered to some extent. In 1950, 54 percent of Japan's coal imports, 13 percent of its iron ore, 11 percent of its salt, and 53 percent of its soybeans, etc., were imported from China.
    However, as a result of the United States' implementation of the "embargo" using the Korean War in 1950, Japanese industry could not obtain raw materials from China, lost the vast Chinese market, and fell into a serious export crisis. The well-known Japanese economist Kazue Nawa said in an article published in the February 1954 issue of the magazine "Kaizo": "Japan's traditional Chinese market has been cut off by the United States, and it is paying a very high price to buy American goods. Taking coal as an example, the freight for importing from China is only 2 or 3 US dollars per ton, but now it costs 9 to 10 US dollars to import from the United States! … From this, it can be seen that the United States wants to permanently use Japan as a market for its surplus goods and to prevent the self-reliance of the Japanese economy caused by the expansion of Sino-Japanese trade, so it refuses to open Sino-Japanese trade. Therefore, this is not a blockade of the Chinese economy, but the Japanese economy itself being blockaded by the United States."
    The actual situation is exactly like this. The United States broke off Japan's traditional trade relations with China, monopolized Japan's foreign trade, and forced Japan to accept its unilateral dumping policy, which greatly increased Japan's foreign trade deficit and foreign exchange deficit. US Assistant Secretary of State Robertson said without concealment in a speech to the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce in the United States on January 13 this year: "In fact, almost one-third of Japan's imports come from the United States, while we only buy about one-sixth of its exports. In 1953, Japan's trade deficit with the United States totaled about 523 million US dollars, which is about half of its total trade deficit." In 1954, US exports to Japan reached 867 million US dollars, accounting for more than 35 percent of Japan's total imports for the year, while Japan's exports to the United States were only 277 million US dollars. From Robertson's remarks and these figures, it can be clearly seen that the trade between Japan and the United States is unequal and very unfavorable to Japan.
    The imbalance in trade between Japan and the United States is the result of the United States treating Japan as a market for its surplus goods, while excluding Japanese goods from being exported to the United States. According to a statement issued by the Japan Tariff Association on March 9 this year, the United States levies a tax equivalent to 30 to 70 percent of the price of goods exported from Japan, while the goods exported by the United States to Japan are almost all tax-free. Recently, Japan requested the United States to reduce tariffs on 250 major commodities exported from Japan to the United States, but the United States has always refused to agree, and is now preparing to increase import tariffs on important Japanese export products such as porcelain, silk scarves, sewing machines, plywood, and glassware; the United States also often refuses to import Japanese goods on the grounds that Japanese goods do not meet American needs. However, the United States exports goods to Japan, regardless of whether Japan needs them or not, and can import them into Japan in large quantities under the cover of the US-Japan "Administrative Agreement" and the US-Japan "Treaty of Commerce and Navigation." This so-called trade between Japan and the United States, which is completely unfavorable to Japan, seriously damages the interests of the Japanese nation and makes Japan virtually reduced to a semi-colonial dumping market of the United States.
    In the past, Japan's huge trade deficit caused by unequal trade with the United States was made up for by US "special procurement orders" and the US military stationed in Japan's consumption of US dollars. However, this further damaged the foundation of the Japanese economy, and the weakness of this economic militarization was quickly exposed. After the Korean armistice, US military orders decreased, and the economic crisis, which had been temporarily alleviated by the development of arms production, quickly developed. With the reduction of US "special demand," the Japanese government had to implement a tight fiscal and financial policy in October 1953 to reduce investment loans and restrict imports in order to balance the huge foreign trade deficit, and the result of all these measures was a large number of factory closures, declining production, increased unemployment, and a sharp decline in trade.
    In order to prevent Japan from developing trade relations with China, maintain its so-called "embargo" policy, and continue to exclude Japanese goods from entering the US market, the United States has urged Japan to seize the Southeast Asian market. The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee said in its report on the Foreign Aid Bill on July 16, 1954, that Japan "should step up its efforts to develop trade with Southeast Asia to compensate for the market it lost in China."
    Facts have proved that this is just a subjective wishful thinking of the US ruling group. In recent years, although the competition for the Southeast Asian market by Japan has been very fierce, and the goods exported by Japan to the Southeast Asian market have exceeded the pre-war amount, what it has obtained there cannot compensate for the losses it has suffered from not being able to trade with China. According to materials from the Japanese "Asahi Shimbun," Japan's exports to Asian countries in 1953 accounted for only one-third of Japan's total exports, while before the war it exceeded one-half.
    Japan's expansion of the market to Southeast Asia cannot but cause a sharp market struggle in that region. Western countries with traditional markets in that region, especially Britain, have taken drastic measures to resist the expansion of Japanese goods. The result of Southeast Asian countries restricting the import of Japanese goods in 1952 has severely hit Japan's exports. Taking exports to the sterling area as an example, it decreased by more than 40 percent in 1953. Another condition that puts Japan at a fatal disadvantage in the competition in that region is the high price of Japanese goods. In order to compete in the Southeast Asian market, Japan has implemented a so-called "double price" method, using maintaining domestic monopoly prices to subsidize exports, and export prices have been lowered below domestic prices. However, the price of Japanese goods in the international market is still higher than the export price of British goods. For example, the export price of 19mm steel bars per ton is 106 US dollars for Japan and 81 US dollars for Britain. Japanese goods were known for their low prices before the war, but now the prices are particularly high. The reason is, as Nawa Kazue pointed out, that the United States prevents Japan from conducting normal trade with China, making it impossible to obtain raw materials from China, and it must purchase them from the United States at high prices and transport them over long distances, which greatly increases the cost of Japanese goods. From these facts, it can be seen that as long as the Japanese economy continues to be controlled by the United States and its trade with China has not returned to normal, Japanese goods cannot restore their pre-war competitive position in the international market.
    The fact that Japan's foreign trade has deteriorated in recent years has made more and more Japanese business people realize that the only way to increase exports and get rid of the predicament is to restore and develop normal trade relations with economically prosperous peaceful and democratic countries, especially neighboring China and the Soviet Union, which have huge domestic markets. In recent years, the calls in Japan for restoring diplomatic and trade relations with China and the Soviet Union have become increasingly high, which is by no means accidental.
    It is under the strong pressure of this economic and social public opinion that the Japanese government has had to repeatedly ask the United States to expand its trade with China. Since 1952, the list of commodities prohibited from being exported to China has been forced to be revised many times. Therefore, the volume of trade between Japan and China has increased somewhat in 1953 and 1954. However, judging from the overall situation of Japan's foreign trade and the past situation, this increase is still very limited and cannot solve the current predicament of the Japanese economy.
    If artificial obstacles are eliminated, trade between Japan and China has broad prospects for development. Some people are spreading a theory that since China is now implementing an industrialization plan, it is impossible to expect Japan to be able to restore large-scale trade with China. This is just making excuses for obstructing Sino-Japanese trade. As early as September 1953, Premier Zhou Enlai of our country pointed out in a conversation with the famous Japanese peace activist Ikuo Oyama: "As China gradually realizes industrialization, the production and needs of the Chinese state and people will expand more and more, and it will increasingly need to develop international trade relations. And Japan is China's neighbor, and on the basis of peaceful coexistence, the development of Sino-Japanese trade and economic exchanges has broad prospects." Facts have also shown that my country's foreign trade volume in 1950 exceeded the pre-war level; in 1953, the foreign trade volume increased by 81 percent compared with 1950; and trade with capitalist countries increased by 52 percent in 1953 compared with 1952. It is very clear that if it were not for the obstruction of the United States, my country's trade with capitalist countries could be greatly increased. China and Japan have superior conditions for developing equal and mutually beneficial trade due to their geographical proximity and long-standing tradition in economic exchanges.

### 战后日本的对外贸易危机

    战后日本的对外贸易危机
　　杜波
    战后以来，日本经济的发展一直处于不正常的状态。现在日本的工业生产虽然超过了战前的水平，它的经济危机却越来越严重。在一九五四年三月到七月，日本的工业生产下跌了百分之十七点六；但从一九五三年七月到一九五四年七月的一年间，日本仓库存货却增加了百分之四十二点四。生产和销售上的这种困难情况，使许多工商企业缩小或倒闭，大批工人失掉职业。在最近一年多来，仅日本的煤矿业就倒闭了三分之一，有十多万名煤矿工人失业。目前日本失业和半失业的人数，已经增加到一千三百万。连日本的政界和工商界人士也不能不承认，日本已处在严重的经济危机的威胁之下。
    导致日本经济严重困难的主要原因，是美国在战后利用它的占领国的地位，强迫日本经济军事化以服务于它的侵略政策，同时强迫日本对和平民主国家实行所谓禁运，使日本经济片面依附美国，破坏了日本的传统对外贸易关系。
    对外贸易对于日本经济的发展具有特殊的意义。因为，日本粮食不足，必须依靠出口工业品以从国外输入；而它的发达的工业，也须依靠输入重要原料和输出大量制成品来维持。例如，日本主要的工业之一纺织业所用的棉花和羊毛全部依靠输入，而产品大部销于国外。黑色冶金工业所用的铁矿石和焦煤大部分仰赖国外。日本如果不能和国外进行正常贸易，它国内的经济生活就将陷于完全瘫痪。
    在第二次世界大战以前，中国是和日本进行贸易的主要国家之一。战后的头几年，虽然已经受到美国的一些阻挠，中日贸易还是有了一些恢复。一九五○年，日本输入的百分之五十四的煤，百分之十三的铁矿石，百分之十一的盐和百分之五十三的大豆等，是从中国进口的。
    但是，一九五○年美国利用朝鲜战争实行“禁运”的结果，使日本工业得不到中国的原料，失去了中国的广阔市场，而陷入严重的出口危机。日本著名经济学家名和统一在一九五四年二月号“改造”杂志发表的一篇文章中说：“日本传统的中国市场被美国切断，付出极高的代价去买美国货。以煤为例，从中国进口每吨运费只要二、三美元，现在却以九美元到十美元的运费向美国进货！……由此可见，美国要永久地把日本作为它的剩余商品的推销市场，要阻碍因中日贸易扩大而引起的日本经济的自立，于是才拒绝开放中日贸易。因此，这不是对中国经济的封锁，而是日本经济自身被美国封锁了。”
    实际情况正是这样。美国把日本同中国的传统贸易关系打断，垄断了日本的对外贸易，强迫日本接受它的片面倾销政策，使日本的对外贸易逆差和外汇收支赤字大大增加。美国助理国务卿罗伯逊今年一月十三日在美国大费城商会发表的演说中，就不加掩饰地说：“事实上，日本的入口货几乎有三分之一来自美国，而我们只购买它的出口货的六分之
  一左右。一九五三年日本对美国的贸易赤字共达五亿二千三百万美元左右，约为它的全部贸易赤字的一半。”在一九五四年，美国对日本的出口达八亿六千七百万美元，占日本全年进口额的百分之三十五以上，而日本对美国的出口却只有二亿七千七百万美元。从罗伯逊的谈话和这些数字中，可以明显地看出，日本同美国间的贸易是不平等的，是对日本很不利的。
    日本同美国间的贸易的不平衡，是由于美国把日本当成它的剩余商品的推销市场，同时却排斥日本货物向美国输出的结果。据日本关税协会在今年三月九日发表的声明说，美国对日本的出口货课以相当于货价的百分之三十到七十的税，而美国对日本出口的货物却几乎全是免税的。最近日本要求美国降低二百五十种日本对美国出口的主要货物的关税，美国不但始终不答应，现在正准备增加瓷器、丝围巾、缝纫机、三合板、玻璃器皿等日本重要输出品的进口关税；美国并经常以日本货物不合美国需要为借口，拒绝日本商品进口。但是，美国对日本输出货物，却不管日本需要不需要，利用美日“行政协定”、“美日通商航海条约”等为掩护就可以大量向日本输入。日本同美国之间这种完全不利于日本的所谓贸易，严重地损害了日本民族的利益，使日本实际上沦为美国的半殖民地性的倾销市场。
    过去日本同美国之间的不平等贸易带给日本的巨额贸易逆差，是依赖美国的“特需订货”和驻日美军在日本所消耗的美元来弥补。但是，这却进一步破坏了日本经济的基础，而这种经济军事化的弱点也就很快暴露出来了。朝鲜停战后，美国军事订货随着减少，依靠发展军火生产而暂时缓和了
  一阵的经济危机便迅速发展起来。在美国“特需”减少的情况下，日本政府为了平衡对外贸易的巨额逆差，不得不在一九五三年十月实行财政金融紧缩政策，减少投资贷款，限制输入，而这一切措施的结果就是工厂大批倒闭，生产下降，失业增加，贸易锐减。
    美国为了阻止日本同中国发展贸易关系，维持它的所谓“禁运”政策，并继续排斥日本商品进入美国市场，曾促使日本去抢夺东南亚市场。美国参议院外交委员会在一九五四年七月十六日关于援外法案的报告中还在说，日本“应该加紧努力来发展和东南亚的贸易，以补偿日本在中国的失去了的市场”。
    事实证明，这不过是美国统治集团的主观的如意算盘。近几年来日本对东南亚市场的争夺虽然很剧烈，日本向东南亚市场输出的货物也已经超过了战前的数额，但它在那里所得到的，却并不能补偿它不能同中国贸易所遭受的损失。据日本“朝日新闻”的材料，日本在一九五三年对亚洲各国的出口仅占日本出口总额中的三分之一，而在战前却超过二分之一。
    日本向东南亚扩张市场，不能不引起那一地区的尖锐市场斗争。在那个地区拥有传统市场的西方国家，首先是英国采取了激烈的办法来抵抗日本货物的扩张。东南亚各国一九五二年限制日货入口的结果，使日本的出口受到了很重的打击。拿对英镑地区的出口来说，一九五三年就减少了百分之四十以上。还有一个条件使日本在那个地区的竞争处于致命的不利地位，就是日本商品价格的高昂。日本为了在东南亚市场上进行竞争，曾实行所谓“二重价格”的办法，用维持国内的垄断价格来贴补出口，出口价格被降低到国内价格以下。但是日本商品的价格在国际市场上仍高于英国商品的出口价格。如十九公厘钢柱每吨的出口价格，日本为一百零六美元，英国为八十一美元。日本商品在战前是以廉价著称的，现在价格却特别高，其原因就是如名和统一所指出的，美国阻挠日本同中国进行正常贸易，使它不能得到中国的原料，必须用高价去向美国购买，远道运输，这样就大大增加了日本商品的成本。从这些事实中就可以看到，在日本经济继续受美国的控制，它同中国贸易没有恢复正常以前，日本商品是不可能在国际市场上恢复其战前的竞争地位的。
    日本近年来对外贸易每况愈下的事实，使越来越多的日本工商界人士认识到，要想增加出口，摆脱困境，就只有同经济繁荣的和平民主国家，特别是拥有巨大国内市场的近邻中国和苏联恢复和发展正常的贸易关系，没有其他的出路。近年来在日本要求同中苏两国恢复外交关系和贸易关系的呼声越来越高，绝不是偶然的。
    正是在这种经济和社会舆论强大的压力下，日本政府不得不一再向美国要求扩大它同中国的贸易。从一九五二年以来，禁止向中国输出的商品名单被迫作了多次的修改。因此，日本同中国贸易额，在一九五三年和一九五四年都有一些增加。但是从日本对外贸易整个的和过去的情况看，这种增加仍然是非常有限的，还不能解决日本经济目前所处的困境。
    日本同中国的贸易如果消除了人为的阻碍，是有广阔的发展前途的。有人在散布一种论调，似乎由于中国现在正在实施工业化计划，因此不可能期望日本能够同中国恢复大规模的贸易。这不过是替阻挠中日贸易制造借口。远在一九五三年九月，我国周恩来总理在和日本著名和平人士大山郁夫的谈话中就曾指出：“中国逐步实现工业化，中国国家和人民的生产和需要就会愈加扩大，它就将愈加需要发展国际间的贸易关系。而日本是中国的近邻，在和平共处的基础上，中日贸易的发展和经济的交流，是完全有它的广阔前途的。”事实也说明，我国远在一九五○年的对外贸易额就超过了战前水平；一九五三年的对外贸易额又比一九五○年增加了百分之八十一；而同资本主义国家的贸易，在一九五三年比一九五二年就增加了百分之五十二。很显然，如果不是美国的阻碍，我国同资本主义世界各国的贸易还可以大大增进。中日两国由于地理上的接近和在经济交流方面悠久的传统，在发展平等互利的贸易方面是有着优越的条件的。
