The carpenter Mu’ertaze of the Yili Oil Press Factory, a joint state-private enterprise of the Xinjiang Liqun Industrial Company, has successfully created an automatic molecular machine. Previously, this oil press factory used a steam engine to drive three windmills to remove impurities from oilseeds. Each windmill could only remove a maximum of 2,000 kilograms of oilseeds per day. Sometimes, the quality of the oil was affected because the dust and other impurities in the oilseeds were not completely removed. Since the Yili Oil Press Factory became a joint state-private enterprise in 1954, the workers' enthusiasm for production has generally increased. With the help of other workers, Mu’ertaze successfully created this machine after much research and experimentation, greatly improving the efficiency of removing impurities from oilseeds. Now, one automatic molecular machine can remove more than 5,000 kilograms of oilseeds per day.

    伊犁榨油厂制成自动分子机
    公私合营新疆利群工业公司伊犁榨油厂木工木尔塔则创造成功了一架自动分子机。以前，这个榨油厂用蒸汽机带动三个风车来清除油籽中的杂质，一个风车每天最多只能清除油籽两千公斤，有时因为油籽里的尘土等杂质清除得不干净，影响了油的质量。榨油厂自一九五四年公私合营以后，工人们的生产积极性普遍提高。木尔塔则在其他工人的帮助下，经过多次的研究和试验，创造成功了这种机器，使清除油籽杂质效率大大提高，现在一架自动分子机一天能清除五千多公斤油籽。
