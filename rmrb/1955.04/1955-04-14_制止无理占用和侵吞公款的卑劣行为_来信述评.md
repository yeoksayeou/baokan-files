Curbing the Despicable Behavior of Unjustified Occupation and Embezzlement of Public Funds—Comments on Letters

Since the publication of the article "People Who Take Advantage of Public Property" in this newspaper on March 17th, we have received over a hundred letters from readers by March 31st. Among them are letters from soldiers, workers, farmers, government cadres, and citizens, as well as elementary school students. They unanimously expressed their indignation at the phenomenon of some employees of the Heilongjiang Branch of the People's Bank of China occupying and embezzling public funds.

The indignation of the broad masses of readers is not difficult to understand. As they said in their letters: the country is carrying out large-scale socialist economic construction, which requires a large amount of funds. The main source of these funds is internal accumulation and savings. For this purpose, the people of the whole country are tightening their belts and saving every possible penny to buy national construction bonds or deposit money in banks. However, some staff members of the People's Bank of China, who are responsible for managing and supervising the use of funds, while calling on the people to launch a patriotic savings campaign and enthusiastically subscribe to bonds, are arbitrarily borrowing the funds accumulated by the people's hard work for extravagant spending. This behavior of occupying public funds for a long time, and even not repaying the loans at all, is essentially corruption and theft of state wealth. This phenomenon cannot be tolerated.

This undesirable tendency is also widespread in other places and departments. Yang Jinxia of the Accounting Section of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China wrote in her letter: "Here, borrowing money by employees has become a habit. Although prices have been stable and wages have been adjusted several times, the phenomenon of borrowing money has continued to increase. Take one section of our office as an example, the amount of loans has reached 612 yuan. One deputy section chief, whose wife is a section member, has only one child and an old woman in the family. Their life is relatively affluent. However, he borrowed more than 200 yuan of public funds two years ago and has not yet repaid it." According to incomplete statistics from 84 units in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the units under the Ulanhot Municipal People's Government, the amount of private loans and misappropriation of public funds by employees last year reached 224,600 yuan. The number of people borrowing money is also very large. The number of employees borrowing public funds in the Tongliao County Grain Bureau accounted for 63 percent of the total number of employees in the bureau. Among these employees who borrowed public funds, with the exception of a few who have special difficulties, the vast majority of employees borrowed public funds to spend at will and squander arbitrarily. Wang Shugang, a cadre of the Inner Mongolia Branch of the China Department Store Company, pre-borrowed more than 400 yuan of public funds during a trip, and spent more than 340 yuan on food and drink alone in 44 days. This is a very bad behavior. They occupy the country's valuable funds for extravagant living, which shows that these people lack socialist moral qualities. "The public property of the People's Republic of China is sacred and inviolable. It is the duty of every citizen to cherish and protect public property." This is clearly stipulated in our country's Constitution. As a citizen of great China, especially all staff members of state organs, should fulfill this obligation.

It should be pointed out that this undesirable tendency is extremely harmful to the country and to the cadres. Because it undermines the state's financial system, occupies and disperses the country's useful funds, and encourages the selfish and wasteful behavior of some cadres, and may even lead some cadres with weak wills onto a dangerous path.

The reason for this undesirable tendency is that some cadres do not have a high socialist consciousness and do not fully understand the importance of accumulating funds for socialist industrialization. But more seriously, the leading cadres of some units do not strictly grasp the state's financial system. When approving loans, they do not act according to the regulations and the actual situation of the borrowers, but "respond to every request", thinking that this is the "mass viewpoint" or regarding it as the "way to unite cadres and connect with the masses", so they "give away the state's wealth" to accommodate the backward emotions of the cadres. This kind of leadership style, which lacks principle, cannot play a role in uniting the cadres at all. On the contrary, it is easy to ruin the future of some people.

Our opposition to the unreasonable borrowing of public funds does not mean that we are indifferent to the difficulties of the employees' lives. In fact, some employees often have no ability to solve special difficulties due to their low income and heavy burden. For these employees, in addition to the recurring difficulties that need to be resolved in the welfare expenses, it is best for the trade union to be responsible for organizing and establishing "mutual aid savings societies" under the principle of voluntary association of employees to solve their temporary difficulties through mutual assistance methods. At present, many units have established such organizations and have played a significant role. The benefit is that it can not only enhance the spirit of mutual assistance and friendship among the masses, but also encourage the masses to actively participate in supervising the payment of funds and avoid the occurrence of unreasonable loans and long-term occupation and embezzlement of public funds. After the "mutual aid savings society" is done well, it not only reduces the administrative working capital, but also prompts cadres to plan their economic lives in a planned way, so as to concentrate on doing their work well. Therefore, this kind of organization should be vigorously promoted and popularized.

### 制止无理占用和侵吞公款的卑劣行为——来信述评

    制止无理占用和侵吞公款的卑劣行为
    ——来信述评
    三月十七日本报发表了“占公家便宜的人”一文以后，截至三月三十一日止，共收到读者来信上百封，其中有战士、工人、农民、机关干部和市民，还有小学生的来信。他们对中国人民银行黑龙江省分行部分职工占用和侵吞公款现象一致表示愤慨。
    广大读者这种愤慨情绪是不难理解的，正如他们来信中所说：国家正在进行大规模社会主义经济建设，需要大量资金。这些资金的主要来源是靠内部积累和节约。为了这一目的，全国人民都在节衣缩食，把可能节省下来的余钱购买国家建设公债或存入银行。然而，作为掌握和监督资金使用的人民银行的某些工作人员，一面号召人民开展爱国储蓄运动，踊跃认购公债，一面却把人民辛勤劳动积累起来的资金随便挪借去挥霍，这种长期占用公款，甚至根本不偿还借款的行为，实质上就是贪污；就是盗窃国家的财富。这种现象是不能容许的。
    这种不良倾向在其他地方、其他部门内也是普遍存在着的。中国人民银行北京分行会计科杨锦霞来信反映：“我们这里职工借款已成为习惯，虽然物价一直平稳，工资也调整了数次，但借款现象仍是有增无减。就拿我们机关的一个科来说，借款数就达六百一十二元。一位副科长，他爱人是股长，家中只有一个小孩和一个老太太。他们的生活是比较富裕的。但他两年前借去公款二百多元，至今仍拖着不还。”据内蒙古自治区八十四个单位和乌兰浩特市人民政府所属各单位的不完全统计，去年职工私人借款和挪用公款就达二十二万四千六百多元。借款人数也很多。通辽县粮食局借公款的职工数竟占全局总人数的百分之六十三。在这些借用公款的职工中，除少数确有特殊困难以外，绝大部分职工都是借了公款，随意花费，任意挥霍。中国百货公司内蒙古分公司干部王述纲，在一次外出时预借公款四百余元，在四十四天中，仅吃、喝就花费了三百四十余元。这是一种十分恶劣的行为，他们为了生活上的挥霍而占用国家可贵的资金，说明这些人缺乏社会主义的道德品质。“中华人民共和国的公共财产神圣不可侵犯。爱护和保卫公共财产是每一个公民的义务。”这是我国宪法已明确规定了的，作为伟大中国的一个公民，特别是一切国家机关的工作人员，应该履行这个义务。
    应该指出，这种不良倾向，对于国家对于干部都有极大的危害性。因为它破坏了国家的财政制度，占用和分散了国家有用的资金，并助长了某些干部自私自利的思想和挥霍浪费的行为，甚至会使一些意志薄弱的干部走上危险的道路。
    造成这种不良倾向的原因，是某些干部社会主义觉悟不高，对为社会主义工业化积累资金的重要意义还认识不足，但是更严重的是，某些单位的领导干部对国家的财政制度掌握不严，他们在审批借款时不根据制度规定和借款者的实际情况办事，而是“有求必应”，认为这就是“群众观点”、或当作“团结干部和联系群众之道”，于是就“慷国家之慨”来迁就干部的落后情绪。这种缺乏原则性的领导作风，根本不能起到团结干部的作用，相反地倒很容易葬送某些人的前途。
    我们反对不合理的借用公款现象，绝不等于对职工的生活困难不问不管。事实上，有些职工由于收入较少，负担较重，一旦遇到特殊困难，往往无力解决。对于这些职工，除经常性的困难需要在福利费中解决外，对其临时性的困难最好由工会负责组织，在职工自愿结合原则下，成立“互助储金会”，通过互助方法加以解决。目前很多单位都已建立起这样的组织，并起了不小作用。它的好处是，既可以增强群众间的互助友爱精神，又可吸收群众积极参加监督资金支付工作，避免不合理的借款和长期占用和侵吞公款现象的发生。“互助储金会”搞好后，不但减少了行政上的流动基金，而且促使干部能有计划地安排自己的经济生活，从而安心搞好工作。因此，这种组织是应该大力提倡、推广的。
