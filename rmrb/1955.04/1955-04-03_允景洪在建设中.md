    Yunjinghong, the seat of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region People's Government in Yunnan Province, is under construction. In 1955, Yunjinghong plans to build 55 buildings, including 11 construction units such as the Autonomous Region People's Government, the Xishuangbanna Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and a hospital, with a total construction area of more than 14,000 square meters. At the same time, city roads will be built, and coconuts, bananas, Burmese osmanthus, and night-blooming jasmine will be planted. A small lake is also planned to be dug in the west of the city. After the completion of this construction plan, the urban area of Yunjinghong will be expanded several times, and Yunjinghong will become a beautiful city full of subtropical scenery. At present, the roof of the office building of the Autonomous Region People's Government has been tiled, and some of the walls have been colored, and it will be completed by the end of April.
    This year, the higher-level People's Committee has allocated special funds to help build Yunjinghong. The Xishuangbanna Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Autonomous Region People's Government have also transferred more than 40 cadres to work on the construction site.

    允景洪在建设中
    云南省西双版纳傣族自治区人民政府所在地允景洪正在建设中。一九五五年允景洪计划修建五十五幢楼房，包括自治区人民政府、中共西双版纳工作委员会、医院等十一个建设单位，建筑面积共有一万四千多平方公尺。同时，还要修筑市区马路，栽种椰子、香蕉和缅桂、夜来香等花木，在市区西边还准备开挖一个小湖。这个建筑计划完成后，将使允景洪市区面积扩大好几倍，允景洪将成为充满亚热带风光的一个美丽的城市。现在，自治区人民政府办公大楼屋顶已经上瓦，部分墙壁已经上色，四月底就可以完工。
    今年，上级人民委员会拨下专款帮助建设允景洪，中共西双版纳工作委员会和自治区人民政府还抽调了四十多个干部在工地工作。（新华社）
