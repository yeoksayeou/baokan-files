Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch: Recently, American officials, congressmen, and ruling-group newspapers have engaged in a fierce dispute over the so-called "defense" of Jinmen and Mazu. The focus of the dispute is: whether to explicitly declare the use of American armed forces to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Jinmen and Mazu, that is, whether to provoke a war with China.

From the discussions on this issue, it can be seen that within the American ruling group, especially within the Republican Party, there is a group of people who frantically advocate provoking a war with China. They have recently once again stirred up what American newspapers call "war fever." According to American newspapers, on March 24th, after returning to the United States from activities in Taiwan and other places, the Chief of Naval Operations, Carney, openly stated at a private press luncheon that the United States should prepare to fight China in mid-April to "defend" Mazu and Jinmen. A large number of war-mongering cries have appeared in some American newspapers. Following this, on March 27th, Republican Senate Leader Knowland clamored that the United States must "defend" Jinmen and Mazu, and he advocated attacking the Chinese mainland and using atomic weapons for this purpose. Republican Senate Policy Committee Chairman Bridges also clamored that the United States must fight to "defend" Jinmen and Mazu.

These elements eager to provoke war occupy powerful positions in the American government, especially in high-level military institutions. According to American newspapers, among the four members of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, three members—Chairman Radford, Air Force Chief of Staff Twining, and Chief of Naval Operations Carney—hold the same views as Knowland. Also, in the State Department, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Robertson is Radford's "ally." The American newspapers often publish the arrogant remarks of these warmongering adventurers, who advocate that "even at great risk, the consolidation of the power of the Chinese Communist regime should be prevented" and that the new China should be "strangled in its cradle." These people believe that if the new China becomes stronger, the United States will be even more "powerless." The "New York Post" published an article on March 31st stating that these people "want to start a war in Asia one way or another," otherwise they will "lose the opportunity to overthrow the Communist Chinese government." They now want the United States to "take a terrible, predictable risk on the Jinmen and Mazu issue."

After Carney, Knowland, and others issued the above war cries to "defend" Jinmen and Mazu, a fierce debate erupted within the American ruling group.

On March 28th, in a meeting of the U.S. Senate, Senate Democratic Leader Johnson delivered a speech accusing "certain leaders of making irresponsible remarks" and "talking about war." After this, in Senate meetings discussing the ratification of the Paris Agreement and other issues, Democratic senators seized the opportunity to attack the clamoring of Republican leaders Knowland and Bridges, as well as the Republican government. Outside the Senate, influential Democrats such as New York Governor Harriman also joined this "movement."

Democratic Senator Kefauver said in the Senate that "there are powerful forces in the government that are clearly bent on waging war with China." He also said: "It is unimaginable that the United States should go to war for Mazu and Jinmen. But some people in high positions in the current government are plotting to wage such a war, no matter how much danger it entails." Democratic Senator Mansfield believes that going to war for Jinmen and Mazu "would be the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time." He criticized Carney's remarks as "creating a state of fear in many American people."

Democratic Senators Morse and Lehman introduced a proposal in the Senate stipulating the revocation of the proposal authorizing the U.S. President to use U.S. armed forces to "defend" Jinmen and Mazu. Sources say that this proposal has been supported by some other Democratic senators.

In addition to newspapers such as the "New York Post," "Washington Post and Times Herald," and "Christian Science Monitor" continuously publishing editorials and articles opposing the views of Knowland and others, those major newspapers that once actively supported the Knowland faction, such as the "New York Times" and the "New York Herald Tribune," have also recently adjusted their tone and continuously published editorials opposing the "defense" of Jinmen and Mazu. On April 3rd, the "New York Times" also published news of "reactions to the threat of war in the Far East" from all over the country, with the headline: "Widespread reluctance to defend Jinmen and Mazu, many people believe the government should clarify its attitude." Many local American newspapers have also published editorials opposing Knowland's views and opposing dragging the United States into war.

Until now, Eisenhower himself has been ambiguous on this issue at recent press conferences, and he has not explicitly announced whether to directly use U.S. armed forces to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating their own islands. American officials explained that this was done to keep China "guessing." However, Reston, the "New York Times" correspondent in Washington, wrote: "The Eisenhower administration's war of nerves over Jinmen and Mazu... may not have confused Beijing, but it has certainly confused Washington."

Within the American ruling group, those who accuse Knowland and others of warmongering and oppose the "defense" of Jinmen and Mazu are clearly no less hostile to the Chinese people than Knowland and others. Just one point is enough to illustrate this: while making these remarks, they almost always did not forget to state that they support the United States' basic policy of aggression against China and support the use of American armed forces to "defend" Taiwan and Penghu. However, they are worried that the practice of rushing to provoke war, as advocated by Radford, Knowland, and others, is too risky. United Press reporters reported in late March that there is "now a sense of unease" in American political circles, believing that the United States "may have underestimated" China's strength. American reporters revealed that General Ridgway, the Army Chief of Staff, who disagreed with the Radford majority on some issues in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also supported the war against China in principle. However, the experience of the Korean War forced him to estimate that the American ground forces are currently definitely at a disadvantage, so he advocated that the United States must first step up its preparations for war.

What also worries these people is that openly provoking a war of aggression to occupy China's coastal islands, as Radford, Knowland, and others have done, will cause strong opposition from the people of the world. Democratic Senator Kefauver said that fighting to "defend" Jinmen and Mazu would be "a great disaster" for the United States, "we (the United States) will get nothing, and no public opinion in the world will support us. We will definitely have no allies." New York Governor Harriman, a Democrat, said, "Every time Americans use atomic weapons to intimidate in Asia, every time Americans talk about Asians fighting Asians," the United States is "losing some friends among the people of all countries." The "New York Post" believes that assuming the obligation to wage war for Mazu and Jinmen would make most of the capitalist world oppose the United States and make the United States conduct "an isolated and helpless war" alone.

Many American newspapers pointed out that another important factor that prompted Democratic congressmen to express their opposition to Knowland's warmongering cries was the strong desire for peace among ordinary American people. "Newsweek" wrote on April 4th that American "congressional leaders are worried that a war over the coastal islands (of China) – or even over Taiwan and Penghu – would be very unpopular with (American) voters." Holding a great power conference to reach an agreement to establish world peace would be "very popular." "All signs indicating public sentiment" show that "what this country (the public) most wants is to stay away from wars in remote areas."

American newspapers analyzed that the Democratic side, considering that the American presidential election will be held next year, is using the American people's desire for peace to attack the Republican Party and add political capital to itself. An article published in the "New York Post" on March 29th stated that the Democratic Party is using Republican Senate Leader Knowland as a "secret weapon against the Republican government." "The Democratic Party is making the most of his warmongering remarks to attack the Republican Party's claim to be a 'peace party,' which was indeed very effective for the Republican Party in the 1952 presidential campaign."

As mentioned earlier, the dispute between the Democratic Party and the Knowland faction only involves the issue of "defending" Jinmen and Mazu, and there is no disagreement on the major issue of occupying Taiwan. One of the purposes of these disputes is believed to be to divert people's attention from the fundamental issue of the United States' occupation of Taiwan, and it is precisely in the United States' basic policy of occupying Taiwan that the same dangerous factors listed by the Democratic Party when attacking Knowland and others are contained.

It is worth noting that hidden behind the current dispute over the issue of "defending" Jinmen and Mazu is a new conspiracy that is brewing. According to news revealed by American news agencies, the content of this new conspiracy is to use the United States' instruction to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to withdraw from Jinmen and Mazu to "eliminate" the "fears" of the United States' allies, and to induce them to undertake the military obligation to "defend" Taiwan together with the United States, that is, to legalize the United States' occupation of Taiwan. At the same time, the United States plans to directly dispatch armed forces to further occupy Taiwan. The "New York Times" reported on April 7th that Washington sources talked about the method: "Once the danger of the United States fighting for Jinmen and Mazu is eliminated," it may be possible to "persuade Britain, Australia, New Zealand, France, the Philippines, and perhaps Canada to participate in a joint guarantee to defend Taiwan," and "send more American troops to that area. … The island of Taiwan itself can be defended by American troops and the American Air Force." The United States is currently attempting to promote the conspiracy of dragging its allies into armed interference in China's internal affairs, and to promote this conspiracy of binding its allies to the American chariot, under the smoke screen of talking about a "ceasefire" of false peace.

    美统治集团内部在阻挠我国解放金门马祖问题上发生争吵
    美国阴谋拖其盟国参加武装干涉我国内政
    新华社十三日讯　最近以来，美国官员、议员和统治集团报纸在所谓“保卫”金门和马祖问题上展开了一场激烈的争吵，争吵的焦点是：是否明确宣布使用美国武装部队来阻挠中国人民解放金门和马祖，也就是是否将向中国挑起战争。
    从关于这个问题的谈论中可以看到，在美国统治集团里，特别是在共和党里，有着一批疯狂地主张挑起同中国的战争的分子。他们最近又一次掀起了美国报纸所谓的“战争热”。据美国报纸透露，三月二十四日，到台湾等地活动后返回美国的海军作战部长卡湼在一个不公开的记者宴会上公然表示美国要准备在四月中旬为“保卫”马祖和金门而同中国作战。在美国一些报纸上出现了大量的战争歇斯底里的叫嚷。紧跟着，美国参议院共和党领袖诺兰在三月二十七日叫嚣美国必须“保卫”金门和马祖，他并且主张为了这个目的要袭击中国大陆和使用原子武器。美国参议院共和党政策委员会主席布里奇斯也叫嚣美国必须为“保卫”金门和马祖而作战。
    这些急于挑起战争的分子，在美国政府里，特别在高级军事机构里，占据着有势力的地位。据美国报纸报道，在美国参谋长联席会议四个成员中，有三个成员——会议主席雷德福、空军参谋长特文宁和海军作战部长卡湼是抱着和诺兰一样的主张的。又如在国务院里，负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊就是雷德福的“盟友”。在美国报纸上经常登载着这些好战的冒险分子的狂妄言论，他们主张“即使冒着巨大危险也应该阻止中共政权巩固它的力量”，要把新中国“这个婴儿绞死在他的摇篮里”。这些人认为，如果新中国更加强大，美国就更加“无能为力”。“纽约邮报”三月三十一日刊载一篇文章说：这些人是“要以这种或那种方法在亚洲搞起战争”，否则他们将会“失掉推翻共产党中国政府的机会”。他们现在就是要美国“在金门和马祖问题上进行一种可怕的、意料之中的冒险”。
    在卡湼、诺兰之流这次发出上述“保卫”金门和马祖的战争叫嚣以后，在美国统治集团内部迸发了激烈的争论。
    三月二十八日在美国参议院会议上，参议院民主党领袖约翰逊发表演说，指责“某些领袖发表不负责任的言论”，“谈论战争”。在这以后，在参议院讨论批准巴黎协定等问题的会议上，民主党参议员纷纷抓住机会，攻击共和党领袖诺兰和布里奇斯的叫嚣以及共和党政府。在参议院外面，民主党的有势力人物如纽约州州长哈里曼等也参加了这个“运动”。
    民主党参议员克弗维尔在参议院发言说，“政府中有着强大的、显然一心想同中国进行战争的势力”。他又说：“不能想像美国应当为马祖和金门投入战争。可是现政府中的一些居于高位的人却正在图谋策划进行这样的战争，不管包含了多大的危险。”民主党参议员曼斯菲尔德认为，为金门和马祖而进行战争“将会是在错误的时间在错误的岛上进行错误的战争”。他指责卡湼的言论“将造成美国许多人民的恐惧精神状态”。
    民主党参议员莫尔斯和利曼在参议院提出一项提案，规定撤销授予美国总统使用美国武装部队来“保卫”金门和马祖的权力的提案。消息说，这个提案受到其他一些民主党参议员的支持。
    除了像“纽约邮报”、“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”、“基督教科学箴言报”这些报纸连续发表社论和文章反对诺兰之流的主张外，那些曾经积极支持诺兰派的大报如“纽约时报”和“纽约先驱论坛报”等最近也调整它们的腔调，连续发表社论反对“保卫”金门和马祖。“纽约时报”四月三日并且刊载了全国各地“对远东战争威胁的反应”的消息，消息的标题是：“普遍不愿保卫金门和马祖，有许多人认为政府应该澄清它的态度”。许多地方性的美国报纸也发表社论，反对诺兰的主张，反对把美国拖入战争。
    直到现在，艾森豪威尔本人在最近的记者招待会上对这个问题闪烁其词，他没有明确宣布是否直接使用美国武装部队来阻挠中国人民解放自己的岛屿。美国官员解释这样做是要使中国“猜不透”。但是，“纽约时报”驻华盛顿记者赖斯顿写道：“艾森豪威尔政府在金门和马祖问题上进行的神经战……也可能没有使北京感到迷惑，但是它肯定地已使华盛顿感到迷惑。”
    在美国统治集团里，那些指责诺兰之流好战、反对“保卫”金门和马祖的人物，他们在敌视中国人民上显然是并不比诺兰之流差的。只要举出一点就足以说明了：他们在发表这些言论的同时，几乎总是没有忘记表明他们是支持美国侵略中国的基本政策的，支持使用美国武装部队来“保卫”台湾和澎湖的。但是，他们担心，像雷德福、诺兰之流主张的那样急于挑起战争的做法是过于冒险了。合众社记者三月下旬报道，在美国政界中“现在有着一种不安的感觉”，认为美国“可能是低估了”中国的力量。美国记者透露，在参谋长联席会议中在一些问题上同雷德福多数派抱不同意见的陆军参谋长李奇微原则上也是支持要对中国进行战争的，然而朝鲜战争的经历使他不得不估计到美国地面部队目前肯定是处于劣势，因此他主张美国必须先加紧备战。
    同样引起这些人担心的是，像雷德福、诺兰之流那样明目张胆地为侵占中国沿海岛屿而挑起侵略战争，会使美国遭到世界各国人民的强烈反对。民主党参议员克弗维尔说，为“保卫”金门和马祖作战对美国“将是一场大灾难”，“我们（美国）将什么也得不到，世界上没有舆论会支持我们。我们一定会没有盟国。”纽约州州长民主党人哈里曼说，“每一次美国人在亚洲以原子武器进行恫吓，每一次美国人谈论亚洲人打亚洲人”，美国就在“各国人民中失去一些朋友”。“纽约邮报”认为，承担为马祖和金门进行战争的义务，会使资本主义世界大多数人反对美国，并使美国单独进行“孤立无援的战争”。
    许多美国报刊指出，使得民主党议员发表反对诺兰好战叫嚣的言论的另一个重要因素，是美国普通人民强烈要求和平的情绪。美国“新闻周刊”四月四日这样写道，美国“国会领袖担忧，争夺（中国）沿海岛屿——或者甚至争夺台湾和澎湖——的战争将非常不受（美国）选民的欢迎”。举行大国会议获致建立世界和平的协议才能“大得人心”。“一切表明公众心情的迹象”说明“这个国家（公众）所最希望的就是躲开在遥远地区的战争”。
    美国报纸分析，民主党方面考虑到明年就要举行美国总统选举，正在利用美国人民要求和平的心理，来打击共和党，为自己增添政治资本。“纽约邮报”三月二十九日刊载的一篇文章说，民主党正利用参议院共和党领袖诺兰作为“反对共和党政府的秘密武器”。“民主党尽量利用他的好战言论来打击共和党自命为‘和平政党’的说法，这种说法在一九五二年的总统竞选中对于共和党事实上是很有功效的。”
    正如前面提到过的，民主党和诺兰派间的争吵仅仅涉及“保卫”金门和马祖问题，而在侵占台湾这一重大问题上并无分歧。这些争吵的目的之一被认为是企图转移人们对美国侵占台湾这个根本问题的注意，而正是在美国侵占台湾的基本政策里包含着民主党攻击诺兰等人时所列举的同样的危险因素。
    值得严重注意的是，隐藏在目前关于“保卫”金门和马祖问题的争吵后边的，是一个正在酝酿着的新的阴谋。照美国通讯社透露的消息，这个新阴谋的内容是，用美国指使蒋介石卖国集团撤出金门和马祖来“消除”美国的盟国的“疑惧”，并诱迫它们同美国一道来承担“保卫”台湾的军事义务，也就是说使美国侵占台湾合法化。同时，美国计划直接派遣武装部队进一步占领台湾。“纽约时报”四月七日报道华盛顿人士谈论的办法是：“一旦美国为金门和马祖而战的危险消除后”，就可能“说服英国、澳大利亚、新西兰、法国、菲律宾，或许还有加拿大来参加保卫台湾的共同保证”，并且“增派美国军力到那个地区去。……台湾本岛可以由美国军队和美国空军防守。”美国方面目前正企图在谈论“停火”的假和平的烟幕下，来推行拖着它的盟国一道来参加武装干涉中国内政的阴谋，来推行这个把它的盟国缚在美国战车上的阴谋。
