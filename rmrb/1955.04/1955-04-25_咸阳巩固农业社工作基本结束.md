Xianyang Solidifies Agricultural Cooperative Work, Basic Completion

The work of rectification and consolidation of one hundred and thirteen agricultural production cooperatives in Xianyang County, Shaanxi Province, has been basically completed. Due to the Xianyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's conscientious implementation of the policy of rectifying and consolidating agricultural cooperatives centered on spring plowing and production, all new cooperatives have been basically consolidated, and great achievements have also been made in spring plowing and production.

Before the autumn harvest of 1954, Xianyang County had a total of thirty agricultural production cooperatives; after the autumn harvest, eighty-three new cooperatives were established. In January 1955, the county's mutual aid and cooperation conference analyzed the situation of all agricultural production cooperatives. After the meeting, the county party committee decided on methods for rectifying and consolidating agricultural cooperatives: the thirty-five well-established cooperatives would be led by the township branches to strengthen leadership; sixty-two relatively good cooperatives with some specific problems would each be assigned a cadre to assist in consolidation work; the sixteen cooperatives with serious problems would be rectified by work teams dispatched by the county party committee. In February, the county party committee convened a three-level cadre meeting to discuss the work plan for rectifying and consolidating agricultural cooperatives. Later, based on the actual work situation and the spirit of the central instructions, it was decided to stop establishing new cooperatives and concentrate efforts on leading the county's spring plowing and production, focusing on rectifying existing agricultural production cooperatives around spring plowing and production. In the process of rectifying agricultural cooperatives, publicity was also carried out on the policy of "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" of grain.

By the beginning of April, the work of rectifying and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives in the county had come to an end, all cooperatives had been consolidated, and only twenty-six farmers in the county withdrew from the cooperatives. During this period, significant achievements were also made in spring plowing and production. Out of the county's 290,000 mu of wheat fields, more than 253,000 mu had been weeded by the end of March, and red spider pests were quickly eradicated. A mass movement to collect fertilizer was launched throughout the county. Farmers in Xixiang Township, Fifth District, had collected more than 8,000 cartloads of fertilizer; the "May 1st" Agricultural Production Cooperative used 60,000 jin of corn stalks to make manure, reversing the situation of fertilizer shortage in half of the wheat fields and insufficient base fertilizer in the cotton fields. Cotton fields throughout the county were plowed, and farmers carried out cotton seed selection work. In the past two months, the county has also trained forty full-time cadres to promote double-wheeled double-shared plows, two hundred and sixty agricultural production cooperative technicians, and six hundred farmers who can use and disassemble double-shared plows.

    咸阳巩固农业社工作基本结束
    陕西省咸阳县一百一十三个农业生产合作社的整顿和巩固工作已经基本结束。由于中共咸阳县委认真执行了围绕春耕生产整顿和巩固农业社的方针，全部新社都得到基本巩固，春耕生产工作也取得很大成绩。
    一九五四年秋收以前，咸阳县共有三十个农业生产合作社；秋收以后，新建了八十三个社。一九五五年一月，全县互助合作会议分析了全部农业生产合作社的情况以后，县委决定了整顿和巩固农业社的办法：三十五个健全的社，由乡支部加强领导；六十二个较好但存在一些具体问题的社，每社派一个干部去帮助进行巩固工作；问题严重的十六个社，由县委派工作组进行整顿。二月间，县委召开全县三级干部会议，讨论了整顿和巩固农业社的工作计划。后来又根据实际工作情况和中央指示精神，决定停止再办新社，集中力量领导全县的春耕生产，围绕春耕生产整顿现有的农业生产合作社。在整顿农业社的过程中，还进行了粮食“定产定购定销”政策的宣传。
    到四月上旬止，全县整顿和巩固农业生产合作社的工作已告一段落，全部社都得到巩固，全县退社的农民只有二十六人。这个期间，春耕生产也取得了显著的成绩。全县二十九万亩麦田，到三月底止已锄了二十五万三千多亩，并且迅速扑灭了红蜘蛛虫害。全县开展了群众性的搜集肥料运动。第五区西城乡农民已搜集肥料八千多车；“五一”农业生产合作社用玉米秆沤粪六万斤，扭转了一半麦田缺肥和棉田底肥不足的情况。全县棉田进行了翻犁，农民们进行了棉花选种工作。两个月来，全县还训练了推广双轮双铧犁的专职干部四十人、农业生产合作社技术员二百六十人和能使用和拆卸双铧犁的农民六百人。　（本报驻西安记者）
