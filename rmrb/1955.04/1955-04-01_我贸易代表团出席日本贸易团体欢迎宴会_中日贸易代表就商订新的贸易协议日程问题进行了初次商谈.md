Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 31st: The Chinese trade delegation visiting Japan attended a welcome banquet hosted by the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and the Japanese Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade on the afternoon of the 30th. Approximately 150 people, including members of the Japanese Diet and prominent figures from the economic sector, attended the banquet.

Those present at the banquet included Shozo Murata, Chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association; Tokutaro Kitamura, Vice Chairman; Masanosuke Ikeda, Permanent Director of the Japanese Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade; Motogiro Sugiyama, Vice Speaker of the House of Representatives; Goichi Kato, Manager of Mitsui Shipbuilding Co., Ltd.; Kyosuke Kodama, Managing Director of Nissan Chemical Industries Co., Ltd.; Ichiro Yoshida, Manager of Hodogaya Chemical Industries Co., Ltd.; and Toshio Takamura, Executive Director of the Japan Lime Nitrogen Industry Association, among others.

Also present at the banquet were Kanzo Uchiyama, Vice Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association; Riri Nakayama, Director of the International Bureau of the All-Japan Buddhist Federation; and Ryang Zhao-han, Chairman of the Tokyo Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

Tokutaro Kitamura delivered a speech on behalf of the two Japanese welcoming groups at the banquet. He stated that the visit of the Chinese trade delegation to Tokyo is a historically significant event for the Japanese people. He expressed his hope to further deepen friendly relations in the future and that this visit would serve as a seed that would bear the fruits of peace, friendship, and cooperation.

In his speech, delegation leader Lei Renmin once again thanked the Japanese friends from all walks of life who welcomed the delegation. He said that the ability of the Chinese trade delegation to visit Japan is inseparable from the efforts of people from all sectors in Japan, which shows that the Japanese people and friends who are keen to promote China-Japan trade have a deep desire to develop economic and trade relations between the two countries.

Lei Renmin pointed out that the economic relations between China and Japan have a long history, and the commodities that the two countries can exchange are extremely extensive. Therefore, the large-scale development of normal relations between the two countries is the common aspiration of the people of China and Japan. The current obstacles hindering the development of China-Japan trade are the existence of artificial barriers and the fact that relations between China and Japan have not yet been normalized, which prevents trade between the two countries from developing to the extent it should. Lei Renmin concluded by saying that during this visit to Japan, they will discuss a new China-Japan trade agreement and other issues related to China-Japan trade with the Japanese side. They believe that with the sincere cooperation of the Japanese side, their discussions will achieve satisfactory results.

During the banquet, the guests frequently raised their glasses to toast the development of China-Japan trade and the increase of friendship between the people of China and Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 31st: Representatives of the Chinese trade delegation visiting Japan and the Japanese inviting groups—the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and the Japanese Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade—held their first talks on the schedule for negotiating a new China-Japan trade agreement on the 30th. During the talks, both sides exchanged views on issues such as the composition and number of members of the central committee responsible for negotiating the agreement and its subordinate subcommittees. The Japanese representatives stated that the Japanese members of the central committee needed to be further discussed and determined by the two Japanese groups before another meeting could be held. The first negotiation meeting, originally scheduled for the afternoon of the 31st, was postponed at the suggestion of the Japanese side.

    我贸易代表团出席日本贸易团体欢迎宴会
    中日贸易代表就商订新的贸易协议日程问题进行了初次商谈
    新华社东京三十一日电　三十日下午，中国访日贸易代表团出席了由日本国际贸易促进协会和日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟主办的欢迎宴会。日本国会议员和经济界知名人士等约一百五十人出席了宴会。
    出席宴会的有日本国际贸易促进协会会长田村省藏，副会长北村德太郎，日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟常任理事池田正之辅，众议院副议长杉山元治郎，三井造船公司经理加藤五一，日产化学工业公司常务董事儿玉恭助，保土谷化学工业公司经理吉田一郎，日本石灰窒素工业会专务理事高村寿惠雄等人。
    出席宴会的还有日中友好协会副会长内山完造，全日本佛教会国际局长中山理理和东京朝鲜人商工会会长梁兆翰等。
    北村德太郎代表日本两个欢迎团体在宴会上致词。他说，这次中国贸易代表团来到东京，在日本国民说来是一件有历史意义的事情。我希望今后能进一步加深相互间的友好关系，并把这次的访问作为一个种子，将来能结下和平、友爱、合作的果实。
    雷任民团长在致词中，再次向欢迎代表团的日本各界朋友致谢。他说，这次中国贸易代表团能够访问日本，是和日本各界人士的努力分不开的，这说明了日本人民和热心于促进中日贸易的朋友有着发展中日两国间经济贸易关系的深切愿望。
    雷任民指出，中国和日本的经济关系有着长久的历史，两国可供交换的货品是极其广泛的。所以大量发展两国间的正常关系。是中日两国人民的共同愿望。当前阻碍着中日贸易发展的是人为障碍的存在和中日两国的关系尚未正常化，这就使中日两国间的贸易还不能发展到应有的程度。雷任民最后说，我们在这次访问日本期间，将和日本方面商谈新的中日贸易协议和其他有关中日贸易的问题，我们相信，在日本方面的真诚合作下，我们的商谈将会得到圆满的结果。
    在宴会进行中，宾主频频举杯，为中日贸易的发展和中日两国人民友谊的增进而干杯。
    新华社东京三十一日电　中国访问日本贸易代表团和日本方面的邀请团体——日本国际贸易促进协会和日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟——的代表于三十日就商订新的中日贸易协议的日程问题进行了第一次商谈。在商谈中，双方就负责谈判协议的中心委员会和它所属的各小组委员会的组成名额等问题交换了意见。日方代表表示日方参加中心委员会的成员需要经过日方两团体继续磋商确定后再行开会。原定三十一日下午举行的第一次谈判会议，在日方建议下延期举行。
