    Five Dishes
    By Japanese writer, Tokunaga Sunao

    We were invited to stay in Beijing for nearly a month. During these days, we were treated in many ways by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Chinese Writers Association, and we lived a very happy and meaningful life. We deeply thank our Chinese friends.
    We visited the Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven, and the Summer Palace, which were already famous in Japan. The Forbidden City was particularly amazing. The magnificence of the buildings was already amazing, but when they appeared one after another, their number and scale were even more astonishing. I had known the poem "Three thousand beauties in the harem" for a long time, but seeing so many huge buildings, I realized that it was not just an adjective. This is of course the crystallization of the ancient Chinese rulers' exploitation of the Chinese people, but the power and magnificence of the Chinese people, which is condensed here, convincingly makes one feel that China is indeed worthy of being the leading power in Asia.
    We watched various kinds of dramas such as Peking Opera, Yue Opera, Ping Opera, and spoken drama. The spoken drama "Bright Sky" touched me very much. I think Chinese spoken drama is better than Japanese spoken drama. Although Japanese spoken drama has a history of thirty years and has excellent actors and directors, the various objective conditions in society are too bad.
    I watched Ping Opera's "Legend of the White Snake" with great interest. It taught me a lot about the issue of critically accepting the legacy of literature and art. In Japan, there are many folk tales similar to "Legend of the White Snake." For example, "The Origin of the Thirty-Three Bay Hall's Ridgepole," which has been adapted into Joruri [1] and drama, is one of them. The story is about a beautiful woman who transforms from a willow tree spirit and falls in love with a man, bearing him a son. When this boy has just learned to walk, the place requires the construction of a large Buddha hall that is thirty-three bays [2] long due to Buddhist reasons. Therefore, this willow tree is cut down, meaning that the woman has to separate from her husband and child. However, many people tie ropes to pull the felled willow tree, but they cannot move it at all. This probably deeply expresses the woman's feelings full of sorrow and anger. But when her own son, led by his father—her husband—holds the rope, the willow tree that dozens of strong men cannot pull moves lightly, as if it is jumping forward on its own. When the Joruri "The Origin of the Thirty-Three Bay Hall's Ridgepole" is sung to this part, the plot also develops to its climax, and all Japanese people who hear this are moved to tears.
    Although my understanding of this legend is not deep enough, I believe that here, realistic and human feelings such as love between men and women and the natural bond between mother and child, although tragic and passive, are cries of resistance against religion with absolute power and the laws of the rulers.
    As I watched "Legend of the White Snake," I secretly associated it with these things. I feel that it is very important to adapt these legends that have been circulating among the people for a long time and express the will of the masses with a correct and positive attitude.
    I enjoyed Peking Opera three times. Even a layman like me can understand that this is a Chinese drama with a long history and complete form. Leaving the drama itself aside for the moment, I would like to say something about the feelings aroused by watching the play. It was probably from the Water Margin, there was a play depicting the Liangshan heroes' struggle with a landlord in a village until their victory, which was very educational. Among the characters, I saw a person with flags stuck on his back, which aroused a great feeling in me.
    I don't know what kind of official he was? A military general with flags stuck on his back, a long beard hanging from his mouth, and a sword at his waist. When I saw this image on the stage, suddenly, a distant, distant impression was revived in my memory.
    That was during the Russo-Japanese War fifty years ago. I was only six years old at the time. My father was forced to participate in this war and went to China for about a year and a half. My father was a farmer who was almost illiterate, and in terms of military service, he was a "transport soldier." Transport soldiers were the lowest in the Japanese army, unable to be promoted no matter how many years they served, unable to receive medals even if they performed meritorious service, and even scolded as "transport soldiers are not soldiers," a very bitter kind of soldier.
    My father, who was such a transport soldier, was driven by Japanese imperialists to drive horses back and forth in the Liaoyang and Shenyang areas of China in order to fight the Tsarist Russian army. At that time, it was still an era when cannons had to be pulled by horses. He had to follow behind the horses, whipping the horses carrying munitions and provisions, and walking in the mud. Naturally, my father did not understand why the Japanese had to fight the Russians. Because the officers hit him with the scabbard, he had no choice but to whip the horses and trudge through the mud.
    Our family, left in Japan, was very poor. I still remember that my mother worked like crazy to support us four children, but even so, we still had many nights when we went to bed crying without food. Why did there have to be a war? Although it was the Russo-Japanese War, the Chinese suffered the most, it was the Chinese people. My mother was also a farmer, illiterate, and she did not understand why there had to be a war.
    She only understood this: the government had taken away the father on whom the family depended, and did not take care of us at all, so in order not to starve to death, she had to work desperately.
    After about a year and a half, my father returned after the war. Because he was a transport soldier, although "Japan won a great victory," all he got was a "war memorial medal." This most bitter transport soldier also brought back some meager gifts, which were five rough electroplated tin dishes. These five dishes were all painted with military generals with flags stuck on their backs, their faces painted with blue or red colors, and long beards hanging down, just like the character I saw in the Water Margin play mentioned above.
    A few years later, the paintings on the tin dishes peeled off, some became unclear, and the dishes were lost one by one. However, the image of the Chinese military general that was reflected in the eyes of the six-year-old child—the image of the Chinese military general with many flags stuck on his back and a long beard hanging down—remains a vivid memory even today, fifty years later.
      In fifty years, human history has developed and changed. Tsarist Russia was overthrown, and the socialist Soviet Union was born, and today it has become a bastion of world peace. In China, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, the Chinese people overthrew the rule of foreign imperialism and domestic reactionaries and achieved a brilliant victory. My father and mother, although subjected to such cruel exploitation, still did not know why they were forced to fight, but their son—I—understood everything. Under the rule of American imperialism and Japanese reactionaries, I am fighting together with many workers and people in Japan for peace and independence.
    My father was whipped by Japanese officers and also whipped the horses, running on the land of China, possibly causing a lot of trouble to the Chinese people. However, my father and them—the Japanese working people—did not understand anything at the time, and naturally, they all hated war. I hope Chinese friends can understand this!
    Now, the Japanese people all hope to restore diplomatic relations between China and Japan, expand trade between the two countries, and carry out cultural exchanges. Such people are increasing day by day among workers, farmers, businesspeople, scholars, artists, and democratic politicians. In fact, the relationship between Japan and China has a history of thousands of years, and from a geographical point of view, diplomatic relations cannot be isolated like this. The Japanese people will soon be able to force the government to listen to their demands, and if the government opposes, it will be overthrown. When the people are able to use their own strength to achieve the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, I am afraid there will be no more wars between the peoples of China and Japan!

    五个碟子
  　日本作家　德永直
    我们应邀在北京逗留了将近一个月的光景，在这些日子里，受到了中国人民对外文化协会和中国作家协会多方面的款待，生活得非常愉快而有意义。我们深深感谢中国的朋友们。
    我们游览了在日本早就闻名的故宫、天坛和颐和园等名胜，其中故宫特别令人惊叹。建筑物的宏伟已经使人惊叹了，而当它们接连不断地出现在眼前时，它们的数量之多和规模之大，更令人惊叹不止。“后宫佳丽三千人”这句诗，我虽然早已知道，可是看到这么多这样庞大的建筑物，我才明白了那并不单单是一个形容词。这固然是古代中国统治者榨取中国人民血汗的结晶，然而凝聚在这里的中国人民力量的强大、雄伟，令人信服地感到中国的确不愧是亚洲头等的大国。
    我们观摩了京剧、越剧、评剧和话剧等各种各样的戏剧。话剧“明朗的天”很使我感动。我觉得中国的话剧和日本的话剧相比，是有过之而无不及的。日本的话剧虽然已有三十年的历史，有优秀的演员和导演，可是社会上各种客观条件太恶劣了。
    我怀着浓厚的兴趣看了评剧“白蛇传”。它使我在批判地接受文学艺术的遗产这个问题上，学得了很多东西。在日本，也有很多和“白蛇传”相似的民间传说。例如已编成了净琉璃〔一〕和戏剧的“三十三间佛殿栋梁之由来”，就是其中之一。故事是说：柳树精变成的美女，和男人恋爱，生下了一个男孩子；当这个男孩子刚刚会走路的时候，那个地方因为佛教的关系，必须建筑一座三十三间〔二〕长的大佛殿，于是，这颗柳树便被砍倒了，也就是那个女子不得不和她的丈夫、孩子别离了。但是，很多人用绳子捆着拉那颗被砍倒的柳树，却一点儿也拉不动它，这大概是深深表现那个女子充满了悲哀和愤怒之情吧。而当她自己亲生的儿子，被他父亲——她的丈夫牵着手去拉绳子的时候，几十个精强力壮的男人都拉不动的柳树，却轻轻地被他拉动了，柳树好像自己跳跃着似地向前移动。净琉璃“三十三间佛殿栋梁之由来”唱到这一段的时候，剧情也是发展到最高潮，所有的日本人听到这里都要感动得落泪的。
    我对于这个传说的了解虽不够深刻，然而我认为，在这里，男女爱情、母子天伦等现实的和人性的感情，尽管是悲剧式的和消极性的，但却是向拥有绝对权力的宗教和统治者的法律发出了反抗的呼声。
    我看着“白蛇传”，心中就暗暗地联想起这些事情来。我感到以正确的积极的态度来改编这种长久流传在民间的、表现人民大众意志的传说，是十分重要的事情。
    我欣赏了三次京剧。即使像我这样的门外汉，也能理解到这是中国具有悠久历史传统和形式完整的戏剧。戏剧本身且先不说，我想说一点由看戏引起的感触。大概是水浒传吧，有一出戏是描写梁山泊好汉和一个村庄的地主斗争直到胜利的富有教育意义的过程的。在出场人物中，我看到一个背上插满旗子的人，他引起了我很大的感触。
    不知他是什么官儿？背上插着旗子，嘴上挂着长胡须，腰间带着宝剑的一员武将。我在舞台上看到了这个形象，骤然地，一个遥远遥远的印象在我的记忆里复活了。
    那是五十年前日俄战争时期的事情。当时我才六岁。我的父亲被迫参加了这个战争，到中国去了约有一年半。我的父亲是个几乎一字不识的农民，从兵种上来说是个“辎重兵”。辎重兵在日本军队中是最下等的，服役多少年也不能升级、即使立了功也得不到勋章，甚至被人骂作“辎重兵不是军人”的一种最苦的小兵。
    就是当这种辎重兵的我的父亲，被日本帝国主义者驱使着，为了和帝俄军队打仗而不得不在中国的辽阳、沈阳一带赶着马东奔西走。那时，还是大炮也要马拖着走的时代，必须跟在马屁股的后面，一鞭子一鞭子地抽打驮着军火和粮秣的马，在泥泞中行走。自然，我的父亲是不明白为什么日本人要和俄国人打仗的。因为长官拿着剑鞘打他，他也只好用鞭子赶着马在泥泞中跋涉。
    留在日本的我们一家是很贫穷的。我还记得，母亲为了养活我们四个孩子，发狂似地干活，即便是那样，我们还是有许多夜晚，吃不上饭哭泣着睡下。为什么一定要打仗呢？虽说是日俄战争，可是受害最重的是中国，是中国人民。我的母亲也是农民，一个大字不识，她完全不明白为什么要打仗。
    她只明白这一点：政府把一家倚靠的父亲抓去了，一点儿也不照应我们，为了不饿死，她就只好拚命干活儿。
    约摸过了一年半，我的父亲在战争结束后回来了。因为是辎重兵，虽然“日本大获胜利”，他得到的只是一枚“从军纪念章”。这个最苦的辎重兵，也带回来一些菲薄的礼物，那就是五个粗糙的电镀的洋铁碟子。这五个碟子上都画着背上插着旗子、脸上抹着青的或红的色彩，挂着长胡须的武将，正像我上面所说的在水浒戏里所看到的那个人物一样。
    几年以后，那洋铁小碟子上的图画有的剥落了，有的看不清了，而且碟子也一个一个地失去了。可是，映在六岁孩子眼中的中国武将的画像——背上插着许多旗子、挂着长胡须的中国武将的形象，五十年后的今天，却仍然留着鲜明的记忆。
      五十年中，人类的历史发展、变化了。帝俄被推翻，社会主义的苏联诞生了，今天已经成为保卫世界和平的堡垒。在中国，中国人民在毛泽东的领导下，打倒了外国帝国主义和国内反动派的统治，取得了辉煌的胜利。我的父亲和母亲，虽然受到那样残酷的剥削，但都还不知道为什么会被迫去打仗，而他们的儿子——我，却是全都明白了。在美帝国主义和日本反动派的统治下，我正在和日本许多工人、人民一起，为争取和平和独立而进行着斗争。
    我的父亲被日本军官们鞭打、自己也鞭打着马在中国的土地上奔走，可能给中国人民造成许多麻烦。可是，我的父亲他们——日本的劳动人民，当时是什么也不明白的，自然，他们都是厌恶战争的。希望中国的朋友们能谅解这一点吧！
    现在，日本人民都希望恢复中日两国的邦交，开展两国贸易和进行文化交流。这样的人在工人、农民、工商业者、学者、艺术家和民主的政治家等阶层中，一天比一天地多起来了。实际上，日本和中国的关系，有着几千年的历史，而且从地理上的关系来说，也不能让邦交这样地隔绝下去。日本人民不久就将能够使政府不得不听从他们的这种要求，政府如果反对，就要被打倒。到了人民能够以自己的力量取得使日中邦交正常化的时候，恐怕日中两国人民之间，就再不会有什么战争了吧！
