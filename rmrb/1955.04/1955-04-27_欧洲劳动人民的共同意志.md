    The Common Will of the European Working People

    The conference of representatives of working people and trade unions of European countries was held in Leipzig from April 22 to 24. More than 1,200 representatives from twenty-five European countries attended the conference, and representatives from the People's Republic of China also attended the conference as observers. The conference discussed the common struggle of the European working people and trade unions for peace and adopted an appeal to the trade unions and working men and women of Europe. The conference called on the European working people to strengthen domestic and international worker solidarity and to fight against the revival of German militarism and the preparation for atomic war, and to defend the living and democratic rights of the working people.

    The convening of the Leipzig conference and the decisions made there marked a new stage in the mass movement in Europe against the preparation for new war plans and marked the strengthening of the unity and concerted action of the working people of European countries in this struggle.

    The Paris Agreements are incompatible with the interests of the peoples of Europe. The purpose of the Paris Agreements is to revive German militarism and to bring a remilitarized West Germany into the aggressive bloc of Western countries. Once this plan is implemented, the danger of a new war will inevitably increase significantly. The people of Europe, who have suffered from the scourge of German militarism, will not forget the causes and consequences of the two world wars. The current Paris Agreements open the door to the revival of German militarism and entrust atomic weapons to German militarists who have more than once caused death and destruction in Europe, which further deepens the danger of turning Europe into a battlefield for atomic warfare. Encouraged by the Paris Agreements, some former Nazi generals in West Germany have recently openly advocated launching wars and using atomic weapons without any scruples.

    The implementation of the Paris Agreements will also exacerbate the arms race in Western European countries. Western countries' "military experts" have already stipulated that West Germany must spend more than 110 billion marks on military expenditures in the next three years in order to rearm, and the United States is also preparing to supply the West German "Bundeswehr" with military equipment worth $3 billion. This is bound to lead to an increase in military expenditures in other European countries. The French National Assembly's Defense Committee stated in a resolution: "If the German army is rebuilt, France's contribution to European defense should be expanded rather than reduced." Former British Defense Minister Macmillan also stated in the British House of Commons that the British government must take the "major factor" of the Paris Agreements into consideration when deciding to increase military spending. Therefore, the implementation of the Paris Agreements means greatly increasing the military burden on the working people of Western European countries, which makes their lives even more impoverished.

    At the same time, in order to eliminate the obstacles to the realization of their aggressive plans, the ruling groups of Western European countries are intensifying their increasingly brutal attacks on the democratic rights and freedoms of the working people of various countries.

    The working people of European countries have seen all of this clearly, and therefore have resolutely opposed the Paris Agreements from the beginning. The 300 million people of the Soviet Union and the European People's Democracies are doing their utmost to carry out socialist construction and will never allow the imperialist aggressive blocs to infringe on their peaceful construction. They fully support the struggle of the people of Western European countries against the Paris Agreements. The people of the German Democratic Republic have also declared that they will never recognize the Paris Agreements. Six million trade union members in West Germany have unanimously condemned the plan to revive German militarism. The German Conference for Security and Peace held in Dresden starting on April 22 once again reflected the German people's determination to oppose the threat of war and strive for the restoration of peaceful reunification of Germany. In France, 4.5 million people have signed petitions against the rearmament of West Germany; the strong opposition of the British people has forced the British Labour Party MPs to abstain from voting on the Paris Agreements in Parliament. These facts irrefutably demonstrate that the people of Europe do not recognize the Paris Agreements and will take action to oppose them.

    The recent successful talks between the Soviet Union and Austria provide another example of the peaceful resolution of international issues. It is no coincidence that the results of the Soviet-Austrian talks have aroused widespread attention and enthusiastic response in West Germany and Western European countries. Anyone without prejudice can see that as long as the Paris Agreements, which create division and hostile military blocs, are cancelled, the German question can be resolved through negotiation on a basis that is conducive to European peace and respects Germany's unification and independence. The road to European peace and national security is not to rely on the United States and participate in its hostile military blocs, but to maintain national independence, abolish hostile military blocs, and resolve all disputes through negotiation. Therefore, preventing the implementation of the Paris Agreements and demanding great power negotiations has become the most urgent common task of the European people.

    The gathering of working people and trade union representatives from twenty-five European countries in Leipzig demonstrates that the idea of uniting against the Paris Agreements has gained widespread support among the people of European countries. The people of European countries are increasingly aware that as long as they expand and strengthen international solidarity and concerted action in the struggle, they will be able to thwart the American aggressive bloc's war conspiracy of "Europeans fighting Europeans" and win the peaceful resolution of outstanding international issues.

### 欧洲劳动人民的共同意志

    欧洲劳动人民的共同意志
    欧洲国家劳动人民和工会代表会议于四月二十二日至二十四日在来比锡举行。参加会议的有二十五个欧洲国家的代表一千二百多人，中华人民共和国的代表也列席了会议。会议讨论了有关欧洲劳动人民和工会为争取和平而共同斗争的问题，并通过了对欧洲各工会和男女劳动人民的号召书。会议号召欧洲劳动人民加强国内和国际的工人团结，为反对复活德国军国主义和准备原子战争，为维护劳动人民的生活权利和民主权利而斗争。
    来比锡会议的召开和所作出的决定，标志着欧洲反对准备新战争计划的群众运动的新阶段，标志着欧洲各国劳动人民在这个斗争中的团结和行动一致的加强。
    巴黎协定和欧洲各国人民的利益是毫不相容的。巴黎协定的目的是复活德国军国主义，并把重新军国主义化的西德拉进西方国家的侵略集团。这个计划一旦付诸实施就将不可避免地使新战争的危险大大增加起来。曾经饱受德国军国主义祸害的欧洲人民，不会忘记两次世界大战的起因和它的后果。现在的巴黎协定为复活德国军国主义打开大门，并把原子武器交给不止一次在欧洲制造死亡和毁灭的德国军国主义者，这就更加深了使欧洲变成为原子战争战场的危险。西德的一些前纳粹将领得到巴黎协定的鼓励，最近他们甚至毫无顾忌地公开鼓吹发动战争和使用原子武器。
    巴黎协定的实施也将加剧西欧各国的军备竞赛。西方国家的“军事专家”已经规定，西德为了重新武装必须在未来三年中花费一千一百多亿马克的军事费用，而且美国还准备以价值三十亿美元的军事装备供给西德的“国防军”。这势必引起欧洲其他国家军事费用的增加。法国国民议会国防委员会在一个决议中说：“如果德国军队重建起来，法国对于欧洲防御的贡献应该是扩大而不是减小。”英国前国防大臣麦克米伦在英国下院中也说过，英国政府在决定增加军费时，必须考虑到巴黎协定这一“重大因素”。所以，巴黎协定的实施就意味着大大地加重西欧各国劳动人民的军费负担，而使得他们的生活更加陷于贫困。
    同时，西欧各国统治集团为了要扫除实现它们侵略计划的障碍，正在加紧向各国劳动人民的民主权利和自由展开日益残暴的进攻。
    欧洲各国劳动人民看清楚了这一切，因此自始就坚决反对巴黎协定。苏联和欧洲人民民主国家三亿人民正在全力进行社会主义建设，绝不容许帝国主义侵略集团侵犯他们的和平建设，他们全力支持西欧各国人民反对巴黎协定的斗争。德意志民主共和国人民并且声明永远不承认巴黎协定。西德六百万工会会员同声斥责复活德国军国主义的计划。四月二十二日起在德累斯顿举行的德国保障安全和和平大会再一次反映了德国人民反对战争威胁、争取恢复德国和平统一的决心。在法国有四百五十万人在反对重新武装西德的请愿书上签了名；英国人民强烈的反对情绪，使得英国工党议员在议会表决巴黎协定时不得不全体弃权。这些事实无可辩驳地说明了欧洲人民不承认巴黎协定，并且要行动起来，反对巴黎协定。
    苏联和奥地利最近的成功的会谈，提供了和平解决国际问题的又一个范例。苏奥会谈的结果，在西德和西欧各国引起了普遍的重视和热烈的反应并不是偶然的。任何没有成见的人都可看得出，只要取消制造分裂和敌对的军事集团的巴黎协定，德国问题是可以在有利于欧洲和平和尊重德国的统一和独立的基础上协商求得解决的。走向欧洲和平和各国安全的道路不是依附美国、参加美国的敌对的军事集团，而是保持各国的独立、取消敌对的军事集团，用协商的办法来解决一切争端。因此，阻止巴黎协定的实施，要求举行大国谈判，成为欧洲人民当前最迫切的共同任务。
    二十五个欧洲国家劳动人民和工会代表在来比锡的集会说明了，联合起来反对巴黎协定的思想在欧洲各国人民中已获得了广泛的支持。欧洲各国人民愈来愈认识到，只要他们扩大和加强在斗争中的国际团结和一致行动，就能够挫败美国侵略集团的“欧洲人打欧洲人”的战争阴谋，就能够争取到用和平的方式解决悬而未决的国际问题。
