The incident in which US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents in Hong Kong plotted to sabotage an Indian International Airlines plane, murdering staff members of the Chinese and Vietnamese Democratic Republic delegations attending the Asian-African Conference, and Chinese and foreign journalists, has been going on for twelve days. In its statement issued on the 12th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs demanded that the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong conduct a thorough investigation of this incident and arrest and bring to justice the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents involved in the conspiracy to assassinate. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also sent a note to the British government, requesting the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong to immediately take emergency measures to strictly monitor and investigate all US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents related to this incident. Fair-minded public opinion around the world has also unanimously pointed out that the British authorities in Hong Kong bear an unshirkable responsibility and should conduct a serious investigation and solve the case quickly.

People hope that since the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong did not seriously treat the Chinese government's warning in advance and take effective measures to prevent the destructive activities of the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, then, after the serious incident has occurred, they should adopt a positive and responsible attitude to investigate and arrest the secret agent saboteurs. However, it is very regrettable that what the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong have taken so far is not this attitude, but rather trying to shirk responsibility as much as possible.

The "Kashmir Princess" plane flew safely from India to Hong Kong without any accidents. It took off after stopping in Hong Kong and suddenly exploded mid-air. More importantly, the Chinese government had informed the British government of the Hong Kong US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents' sabotage plot in advance. Obviously, the planners of this conspiracy were the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agent organs in Hong Kong; the location for carrying out the assassination activities was the Hong Kong airport; and the direct destructive criminals were the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agent elements mixed in the airport.

Of course, the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong cannot be unaware of these circumstances. However, they are unwilling to take severe and effective steps in this regard.

The Hong Kong British authorities issued a statement on the 13th, asserting that "the possibility of burying anything on the plane while in Hong Kong is extremely small." This shows that the British authorities in Hong Kong only thought about how to shirk responsibility from the beginning and lacked the sincerity to conduct a serious "detailed investigation."

The British government's reply to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note, announced on the 17th, further increased people's doubts about the sincerity of the British government. In addition to repeating the content of the aforementioned statement by the Hong Kong British authorities, this reply even attempted to completely shirk the serious responsibility borne by the Hong Kong British authorities on the grounds that "since the plane belonged to Indian Airlines and the crash did not occur within British territory or territorial waters." It should be reminded once again to the British government: it is necessary to investigate the "cause" of the incident in Hong Kong, not in other "territorial waters" or "territories."

If the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong continue to conduct investigations with such an attitude, what will be the result? Obviously, there will be no result.

If the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong do not change their current attitude and take the necessary measures against the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agent elements related to the conspiracy sabotage incident, then one cannot help but wonder whether the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong are intentionally condoning and shielding the destructive activities of the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents in Hong Kong?

    英国当局对美蒋特务破坏活动究竟采取什么态度
    赵文
    香港美蒋特务预谋破坏印度国际航空公司飞机，杀害我国和越南民主共和国参加亚非会议代表团工作人员和中外记者的事件，已经有十二天了。我国外交部在十二日发表的声明中要求英国政府和香港英国当局对这一事件进行彻底查究，把参与阴谋暗害事件的美蒋特务分子逮捕法办。我国外交部并照会英国政府，要求英国政府和香港英国当局立即采取紧急措施，把所有与这一事件有关的美蒋特务分子严加监视，进行侦查。全世界的公正舆论也一致指出，香港英国当局负有不可推卸的责任，应该认真调查，迅速破案。
    人们希望，英国政府和香港英国当局既然事前没有认真对待中国政府的警告，采取有效的措施，防止美蒋特务的破坏活动，那么，在严重的事件已经发生以后，就理应采取积极负责的态度，侦查和逮捕特务破坏分子。但是，令人非常遗憾，迄今为止，英国政府和香港英国当局所采取的，却不是这种态度，而是尽量设法推卸责任。
    “克什米尔公主号”飞机从印度安然飞到香港，没有发生任何事故，在香港停留后起飞，途中突然发生爆炸。更重要的，我国政府事前就把香港美蒋特务的破坏阴谋通知了英国政府。很明显，这次阴谋事件的策划者是在香港的美蒋特务机关；进行暗害活动的地点是在香港的飞机场；而直接破坏的凶犯则是混在飞机场内的美蒋特务分子。
    对于这些情况，英国政府和香港英国当局当然是不会不知道的。但是，他们却不愿在这方面采取严厉的和有效的步骤。
    香港英国当局十三日发表声明，就断言“在香港时把任何东西埋藏在飞机上的可能性是极少的”。这说明香港英国当局一开始就只想到如何推卸责任，缺乏认真进行“详细调查”的诚意。
    英国政府十七日公布的对我国外交部照会的复照，进一步增加了人们对于英国政府所具诚意的怀疑。这个复照除了重复香港英国当局上述声明的内容外，竟以“由于这架飞机是属于印度航空公司的，而且坠毁不是发生在英国的领土或领海以内”为理由，企图完全推卸香港英国当局所负的严重责任。应该再一次提醒英国政府：必须是在香港，而不是在其他“领海”或“领土”去调查事件的“原因”。
    英国政府和香港英国当局如果继续抱着这样的态度进行调查，那会有什么结果呢？显然是不会有什么结果的。
    如果英国政府和香港英国当局不改变目前的态度，对同阴谋破坏事件有关的美蒋特务分子采取应有的措施，那就不能不使人发生这样一个疑问，英国政府和香港英国当局是否有意纵容和包庇香港的美蒋特务破坏活动呢？
