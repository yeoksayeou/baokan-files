The air commander Zhang Weiliang of a certain bomber unit of the People's Liberation Army Air Force has repeatedly made military exploits in the liberation of the coastal islands of Zhejiang. At this first congress of heroes, model workers, and meritorious personnel of the Air Force, he was honorably elected as a second-class combat hero.

In January 1955, frequent victories of our People's Air Force in attacking Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops were reported from the Zhejiang East Front. At that time, Zhang Weiliang and his comrades were in the heat of battle.

At noon on January 10th, Zhang Weiliang received the order to bomb Chiang Kai-shek's bandit warships. In order to seize the opportunity, he didn't even finish his meal before leading his comrades to the airport. When the control tower issued the takeoff signal, Zhang Weiliang's iron eagle took off first, followed by his comrades who also flew their iron eagles towards the Dachen war zone. A strong wind was blowing on the route, but Zhang Weiliang calmly led the powerful air fleet forward. They flew into the blue ocean sky, and Dachen Island appeared in front of them. Flying further, Zhang Weiliang vaguely saw a black dot in the Dachen harbor. He carefully observed and searched, and then discovered a second small black dot. Zhang Weiliang immediately determined that these were Chiang Kai-shek's bandit warships. He issued an order to his comrades to prepare for bombing. At this time, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit warships frantically fired anti-aircraft artillery, forming layers of fire nets in front of our air fleet. At this very tense moment, Zhang Weiliang issued an order to the fleet, and Cai Zhichen, the chief of navigation on the same plane, quickly locked the aiming device on a large warship. Zhang Weiliang then continuously corrected the course according to his requirements. When Cai Zhichen issued the "drop bombs" command, heavy bombs roared down towards Chiang Kai-shek's bandit warship one after another, hitting the warship's head accurately. At this time, pilot Song Zongzhou also flew his iron eagle closely behind, and the bombs he dropped exploded in the middle of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit warship. This warship was a "Zhong" class landing ship given to Chiang Kai-shek's bandits by American imperialism. The ammunition on the ship exploded, and gasoline ignited. At this time, pilot Ning Fukui, following Zhang Weiliang's orders, also damaged another of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit warships. Dachen Harbor was engulfed in smoke and fire.

January 18th was the day when our People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces jointly fought to liberate Yijiangshan Island. Early that morning, Zhang Weiliang and his comrades drove iron eagles loaded with heavy bombs, ascended into the high sky, and flew towards Yijiangshan Island under the cover of our fighter aircraft units. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on Yijiangshan Island had not had time to think that our air fleet would appear over their heads so early, a large number of bombs were poured down and exploded on the island at the same moment, giving the Chiang Kai-shek troops a severe blow.

In the afternoon, Zhang Weiliang again drove an iron eagle, leading his comrades to fly over Yijiangshan Island for the second time to bomb and cover our army's landing. At this time, our army's artillery was fiercely bombarding Yijiangshan Island. The warships of our People's Navy sped towards Yijiangshan Island. The offensive began. When Zhang Weiliang saw that our landing craft were about to approach the shore but the enemy on the island was still attempting to resist stubbornly, he knew that this was the moment when the army needed the most support. Zhang Weiliang immediately led his comrades to fly over the landing point of our army and bombard the enemy fiercely. Our assault aircraft units also carried out low-altitude bombing and strafing against the enemy troops on the island. Our army's warriors landed smoothly.

On the first day after the liberation of Yijiangshan Island, Zhang Weiliang was ordered again to lead the air fleet to Dachen Island, bombed Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army's headquarters, radar station, and artillery positions, and achieved a glorious victory.

    英雄的空中指挥员张伟良
    新华社记者　黄叔贤
    人民解放军空军某轰炸部队的空中指挥员张伟良，在解放浙江沿海岛屿中屡建战功。这次在空军首届英雄模范功臣代表大会上，他光荣地当选为二级战斗英雄。
    一九五五年一月间，浙东前线曾频频传来我人民空军不断地打击蒋贼军的胜利消息。那个时候，张伟良和他的战友们处在火热的战斗之中。
    一月十日中午，张伟良接到轰炸蒋贼军舰的命令。为了抓住战机，他连饭也没吃饱，就率领他的战友跑到机场上。当塔台发出起飞讯号时，张伟良驾驶的铁鹰首先凌空而起，接着他的战友们也驾起铁鹰跟着他向大陈战区飞去了。航线上刮着大风，张伟良沉着地率领着强大机群前进。他们飞进了蓝色的海洋上空，大陈岛已出现在面前了。再往前飞，张伟良隐约地看到大陈海港里有个黑点。他仔细地观察，搜索、又发现了第二个小黑点。张伟良立刻判明这是蒋贼军舰。他向战友们发出准备轰炸的命令。这时，蒋贼军舰慌乱地发射着高射炮火，在我军机群前面构成了一层层火网。就在这十分紧张的时刻，张伟良向机群发出了命令，同机领航主任蔡之臣很快就把瞄准器套住一艘大军舰。张伟良便按着他的要求不断地修正航向。当蔡之臣发出“投弹”的口令时，重磅炸弹一颗接着一颗呼啸着向蒋贼军舰飞下去，正好炸中军舰的头部。这时，飞行员宋宗周也驾驶着他的铁鹰紧跟着过来，他投下去的炸弹在蒋贼军舰中部爆炸了。这艘军舰就是美帝国主义给蒋贼的一艘中字号登陆舰，舰上的弹药爆炸了，汽油燃烧起来。这时，飞行员宁福奎遵照张伟良的命令，又炸伤了蒋贼的另一艘军舰。大陈港被烟火吞没了。
    一月十八日，是我人民解放军陆、海、空军联合作战，解放一江山岛的一天。这天清早，张伟良和战友们驾起挂满重磅炸弹的铁鹰，升入高空，在我歼击机部队掩护下向一江山岛飞去。当一江山岛上的蒋贼军还没有来得及想到我军的机群会这样早就出现在他们头上时，大量的炸弹就在同一时刻倾泻在岛上爆炸了。给了蒋贼军严重的打击。
    下午，张伟良又驾起铁鹰率领着战友们第二次飞临一江山岛进行轰炸，掩护我陆军登陆。这时，我陆军炮兵向一江山岛猛烈地轰击着。我人民海军的舰艇向一江山岛疾驶。进攻开始了。当张伟良看到我军的登陆艇就要靠岸而岛上的敌人还企图顽抗时，他知道这是陆军最需要支援的时刻。张伟良立刻率领着战友们飞到了我陆军登陆点的上空，向敌人猛烈地轰炸。我冲击机部队也向岛上敌军进行低空轰炸扫射。我陆军勇士们顺利登陆了。
    在一江山岛解放后的第一天，张伟良又奉命带领机群飞往大陈岛，轰炸了蒋贼军的指挥所、雷达站和炮兵阵地，取得了光辉胜利。
