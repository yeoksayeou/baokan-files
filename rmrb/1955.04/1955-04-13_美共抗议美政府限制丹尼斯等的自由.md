Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 10th. According to a report in the New York "Worker Daily" on the 3rd, the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States issued a statement condemning the restrictions placed on the freedom of Eugene Dennis, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the United States, and other party leaders who were released from prison, according to the reactionary Smith Act.

The statement pointed out that these outstanding leaders of the American working class, after being imprisoned for a long time, were released on March 1, 1955, after serving their sentences, but they were restricted by the provisions of the Smith Act regarding Communists. That is to say, for the next sixteen months, Dennis's movement, activities and association will be absolutely prohibited.

The statement called on all people who love peace and democracy to take action to restore and protect the constitutional freedom of all those who have suffered from the Smith Act, to prevent Dennis and others from falling into danger again, and to launch a nationwide campaign against the Smith Act, the McCarran Act, and the Butler-Humphrey Act, and other fascist laws that stifle the human rights of Communists and non-Communists alike.

    美共抗议美政府限制丹尼斯等的自由
    新华社柏林十日电　据纽约“工人日报”三日报道，美国共产党全国委员会发表声明，谴责根据反动的史密斯法对获释出狱的美国共产党总书记尤金·丹尼斯和党的其他领袖的自由所加的限制。
    声明指出，美国工人阶级的这些杰出领袖，在被长期监禁以后，已经在一九五五年三月一日服刑期满被释放出来，但是他们却受到史密斯法中关于共产党员的条款的规定的限制。这就是说，在今后十六个月中，丹尼斯等的迁移，活动和交往将绝对受到禁止。
    声明号召一切热爱和平、民主的人采取行动来恢复和保障所有身受史密斯法之害的人们的宪法自由，不让丹尼斯等重新陷入危难，开展全国性的运动反对扼杀共产党员和非共产党员的人权的史密斯法、麦卡伦法和巴特勒—汉弗莱法等法西斯法律。
