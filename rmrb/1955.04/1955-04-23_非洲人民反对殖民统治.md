African People Oppose Colonial Rule

Gao Hong

With the rise of the African people's awareness after the war, the struggle of the African people for national independence and liberation has seen new developments. The scattered and spontaneous resistance of individual tribes and individual groups of residents against imperialist colonial rule in the past has today become, or is becoming, a mass, organized, and conscious struggle for national independence and liberation. The large-scale resistance of the people of various countries to imperialist colonial rule is shaking the imperialist colonial system in Africa.

The African continent, which has been the object of plunder by Western colonial countries for hundreds of years, still has only a few countries that have escaped the fate of colonies, and the vast majority of regions are still under the direct rule of imperialism.

Since the 19th century, the Morgan family, the Rockefeller family, and other financial giants in the United States have been continuously expanding their colonial influence in Africa. After World War II, the United States, with its ambition to dominate the world, expanded its colonial influence everywhere and intensified its intrusion into Africa. In the more than 11 million square miles of land in Africa, there is now hardly a place without an American company. These monopoly organizations greedily plunder Africa's abundant resources, from which they obtain huge super-profits. In 1952, the profit rate of various American companies investing capital in British Africa was 31.3 percent. As the Cape Town "New Century" weekly in South Africa said, although the United States itself has no colonies in Africa, it is one of the countries that has placed the biggest bet on the colonial system. The intrusion of American forces into Africa has not only strengthened the exploitation of the African people but has also directly participated in the bloody activities of suppressing the African people's national liberation movement.

The imperialist colonialists' plunder and exploitation of the African people is particularly savage and cruel. To this day, they still seize the land of the African people by means of open robbery. The colonialists' plantations and mines are constantly being established and expanded, while Africans who have lived in these areas for generations are driven to barren places. Imperialist monopoly capital, in order to keep Africa in the position of a supplier of agricultural raw materials forever, has tried its best to hinder the development of African industry. They force various regions of Africa to become areas of single planting according to their own needs. The single-crop nature of this colonial economy has created the colony's dependence on the suzerain state, thereby facilitating imperialist plunder in unequal trade.

The American aggressive bloc also regards Africa as an important military base for preparing for new wars. The American military base network has spread to every corner of Africa. The United States has military bases in Tunisia, Morocco, Congo, Kenya, Sudan, Uganda, Abyssinia, Libya, and Liberia. The establishment of a large-scale military base network in Africa by the United States seriously threatens the security and peace of the African region and has also become an important stronghold for maintaining imperialist colonial interests in Africa and opposing the African people's national liberation movement.

However, the African people, regardless of everything, have raised the banner of national liberation and launched an increasingly widespread struggle. The people of Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria have carried out and continue to carry out heroic struggles to demand national autonomy and the establishment of independent republics. Under the powerful pressure of the people's struggle for national independence, the French colonialists once put forward the hypocritical promise of so-called "democratic reforms" in North Africa. But the people of North Africa have seen through this trick played by the colonialists to maintain colonial rule. In May 1953, the Tunisian people boycotted the "municipal elections" manufactured by the colonial authorities, and 70 percent of the voters across the country refused to vote. In order to oppose France's "reform plan," the Tunisian people held large-scale strikes and market strikes continuously in March 1954. The Tunisian people have adopted the method of armed struggle in the struggle for national independence. A "National Liberation Army" has been actively developing activities in the south and central parts of Tunisia, persistently resisting the "encirclement and suppression" of the French army. In recent years, the Algerian people have continuously held strike struggles, and in order to seek the complete liberation of the nation, they launched a nationwide armed uprising on October 31, 1954. Now, the people's armed forces opposing colonial rule have established guerrilla warfare bases in the mountainous areas of southern Algeria. The national liberation movement of the Moroccan people has also seen a new upsurge in recent years. Under the influence of the powerful people's movement, former Sultan Yusuf refused to sign France's "reform plan." In August 1953, the French Governor-General forcibly deposed and exiled Sultan Yusuf, which further aroused the anger of the people. Demanding the restoration of Sultan Yusuf's throne has become a concrete slogan of the Moroccan people's struggle. In August 1954, in order to commemorate the first anniversary of the deposition of Sultan Yusuf, riots broke out in the capital Rabat and the port of Audi, and workers carried out a general strike on August 20.

In British East Africa, the masses of the people have been carrying out heroic struggles to fight for national independence and demand the return of confiscated land. In May 1951, the people of Kenya held a mass rally of more than 10,000 people in Nairobi, resolving to demand the return of confiscated land. In order to resist the armed suppression of the British colonial army, the Kenyan people organized the People's Resistance Army and launched an armed struggle. The large-scale demonstrations, strikes, and boycotts of British goods by the people of the Gold Coast, which opposed colonial rule, forced Britain to agree to hold elections in the Gold Coast and allow Africans to hold government jobs. In Nigeria, the people put forward the slogan of struggle to establish a "Nigerian autonomous government" in 1956. Since 1944, there have been armed riots and soldier rebellions in the Congo under Belgian rule every year. In other colonial countries, the movement demanding national independence is also developing.

Opposition to the imperialist system of racial discrimination is another important aspect of the African people's struggle for freedom and liberation. In the Union of South Africa, the government's consistent policy of national discrimination and national oppression has been strongly resisted by people of all ethnic groups, and the unity of Africans, Indians, and other oppressed ethnic groups in the struggle is growing. In order to oppose racial discrimination, the copper miners in Northern Rhodesia held an unprecedented general strike in late October 1952, which lasted for as long as 20 days.

In the struggle for national independence and liberation, the unity of the African people is strengthening. In some colonial countries, national united front organizations have been formed or are being formed. Democratic forces in French West Africa have organized the "African Democratic Rally," which has more than one million members. In 1944, Nigeria established the democratic united front organization "National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons." After the war, the people of the Gold Coast also formed democratic youth organizations and a national united front. The "Algerian Front for the Defense and Respect of Freedom," established in 1951, is leading the Algerian people's movement for national independence. The formation of the national united front marks a huge progress in the African people's struggle for national liberation and democratic rights.

The stubborn resistance of the African people to colonial rule has greatly alarmed imperialism. In order to strangle the African people's national liberation movement, the colonialists use machine guns and bayonets to deal with peaceful residents. In 1951, the French colonial army launched a large-scale offensive against the residents of Morocco, arresting more than 35,000 people. In order to suppress the national liberation struggles in Tunisia and Algeria, the French colonialists sent a large number of troops to carry out so-called "encirclement and suppression" and "sweeping." The French colonialists' bloody suppression of the people of North Africa used airplanes and artillery supplied by the United States and received direct help from the American army. The British colonialists' bloody actions to suppress the people of Kenya are particularly appalling. From October 1952 to October 1953, the British colonial authorities killed more than 5,000 Africans in Kenya, and more than 80,000 people have now been imprisoned in concentration camps. However, this inhuman atrocity of the colonialists has not been able to suppress the African people's struggle for independence and liberation but has aroused even greater resentment among the people.

The African people's struggle for national independence and liberation has received the sympathy and support of all progressive mankind in the world. France's suppression of the people of North Africa was first opposed by the people of Arab countries. Arab countries have repeatedly suggested to the United Nations General Assembly to resolve the North African issue, and these proposals have received strong support from the Soviet Union. The "Resolution on National Independence Issues" adopted by the 1952 Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference strongly opposed racial discrimination. In 1953, the World Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement protesting the treatment suffered by the African people of Kenya. The resolutions passed at the recent Asian countries conference also condemned colonialism and racial discrimination policies. In the current Asian-African conference, human rights and the right to self-determination, as well as the issue of affiliated countries, have been included in the agenda, and the common aspirations of the Asian and African people for national independence and equality will undoubtedly receive further mutual support and encouragement at this conference.

The flames of struggle for national independence and liberation have been ignited on the African continent. Africa, known as the "Dark Continent," is no longer a place where imperialism can plunder at will and enslave the local people. The African people will inevitably break free from the shackles of imperialism and finally gain freedom and liberation.

    非洲人民反对殖民统治
    高虹
    随着战后非洲人民觉悟的提高，非洲人民争取民族独立和解放的斗争有了新的发展。过去个别部落和个别居民集团对帝国主义殖民统治的分散和自发的反抗，今天已成为或正在成为群众性的、有组织的争取民族独立和解放的自觉的斗争。各国人民对帝国主义殖民统治的大规模反抗，正动摇着帝国主义在非洲的殖民体系。
    几百年来一直成为西方殖民国家掠夺对象的非洲大陆，直到现在还只有少数几个国家摆脱了殖民地的命运，绝大部分地区，仍在帝国主义的直接统治之下。
    美国的摩根家族、洛克菲勒家族和其他金融巨头，从十九世纪起就在非洲不断扩大他们的殖民势力。第二次世界大战以后，美国怀着独霸世界的野心，到处扩张它的殖民势力，更加紧侵入非洲。在非洲一千一百多万平方英里的土地上，现在几乎没有一块地方没有美国公司。这些垄断组织贪婪地掠夺着非洲的丰富资源，从中获得巨大的超额利润。在英属非洲投有资本的美国各公司在一九五二年的利润率为百分之三十一点三。正如南非开普敦的
  “新世纪”周报所说，虽然美国自己在非洲没有殖民地，但是它是在殖民制度上押了最大赌注的国家之一。美国势力侵入非洲，不仅加强了对非洲人民的剥削，并且直接参加了镇压非洲人民民族解放运动的血腥活动。
    帝国主义殖民者对非洲人民的掠夺和剥削是特别野蛮和残酷的。它们直到今天，仍然以公开的抢劫方式，夺取非洲人民的土地。殖民主义者的种植园和采矿场不断建立和扩大起来，而世代居住在这些地区的非洲人，则被赶到贫瘠的地方去。帝国主义垄断资本为了使非洲永远处于农业原料供应地的地位，竭力阻碍非洲工业的发展。它们根据自己的需要，强迫非洲各个地区变为单一种植的区域。这种殖民经济所具有的单一作物的性质，造成了殖民地对宗主国的依赖，从而便利于帝国主义在贸易中进行不等价的掠夺。
    美国侵略集团还把非洲当作它们准备新战争的重要军事基地。美国军事基地网已遍布非洲各个角落。在突尼斯、摩洛哥、刚果、怯尼亚、苏丹、乌干达、阿比西尼亚、利比亚以及利比里亚等地，美国都拥有军事基地。美国在非洲建立大规模的军事基地网，严重地威胁着非洲地区的安全和和平，同时又成为维护帝国主义在非洲的殖民利益和反对非洲人民民族解放运动的重要据点。
    但是，非洲人民不顾一切地高举起民族解放的旗帜，展开了日益广泛的斗争。突尼斯、摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚的人民，为要求实行民族自治和建立独立的共和国，进行了并继续进行着英勇的斗争。法国殖民者在人民争取民族独立的强大声势下，曾提出在北非实行所谓“民主改革”的虚伪诺言。但是北非人民已经看穿了殖民者所玩弄的这种维持殖民统治的把戏。一九五三年五月，突尼斯人民抵制了殖民当局制造的“市政选举”，全国百分之七十的选民拒绝投票。为了反对法国的“革新计划”，突尼斯人民在一九五四年三月连续举行了大规模的罢工和罢市。突尼斯人民在争取民族独立的斗争中，已采取了武装斗争的方式。一支“民族解放军”已在突尼斯的南部和中部积极展开活动，坚持地抗击着法国军队的“清剿”。阿尔及利亚人民近年来曾不断举行罢工斗争，并且为了求得民族的彻底解放，曾于一九五四年十月三十一日进行了全国规模的武装起义。现在，反对殖民统治的人民武装，已在阿尔及利亚南部山区建立了游击战争根据地。摩洛哥人民的民族解放运动近年来也有了新的高涨。前苏丹优素福在强大的人民运动的影响下，拒绝在法国的“改革方案”上签字。一九五三年八月，法国总督以武力废黜和放逐了苏丹优素福，这就更激起人民的愤怒。要求恢复苏丹优素福王位，已成为摩洛哥人民斗争的一个具体口号。一九五四年八月，摩洛哥人民为纪念苏丹优素福被废一周年，首都拉巴特及奥地港发生了暴动，工人并在八月二十日实行了总罢工。
    在英属东非洲，人民群众为争取民族独立和要求收回被没收的土地，一直进行着英勇的斗争。怯尼亚人民一九五一年五月在内罗毕举行了一万多人的群众大会，决议要求归还被没收的土地。为了抗击英国殖民军队的武装镇压，怯尼亚人民组织了人民抵抗军，展开了武装斗争。黄金海岸人民声势浩大的反对殖民统治的示威、罢工和抵制英货运动，曾迫使英国同意在黄金海岸实行选举，并由非洲人担任政府工作。在尼日利亚，人民提出了在一九五六年成立“尼日利亚自治政府”的斗争口号。从一九四四年以来，比利时统治下的刚果每年都有武装暴动和士兵叛乱的事件发生。在其他殖民地国家，要求民族独立的运动也正在发展。
    反对帝国主义的种族歧视制度，是非洲人民争取自由和解放的另一重要内容。在南非联邦，政府一贯实行的民族歧视和民族压迫政策，遭到了各族人民的强烈反抗，非洲人、印度人和其他被压迫的各族人民在斗争中的团结正日益增强。北罗得西亚的铜矿工人，为了反对种族歧视，曾在一九五二年十月下旬举行了空前大罢工，并坚持了二十日之久。
    争取民族独立和解放的斗争中，非洲人民的团结正在增强。在一些殖民地国家中，民族统一战线组织已经形成或正在形成。法属西非洲的民主力量组织了拥有一百多万盟员的“非洲民主同盟”。尼日利亚在一九四四年就成立了“尼日利亚和喀麦隆国民议会”的民主统一阵线组织。黄金海岸的人民在战后也组成了民主的青年组织和民族统一战线。一九五一年成立的“阿尔及利亚保卫和尊重自由阵线”，正领导阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的运动。民族统一阵线的形成，标志着非洲人民争取民族解放和民主权利斗争的巨大进展。
    非洲人民对殖民统治的顽强反抗，使帝国主义大为惊慌。为了扼杀非洲人民的民族解放运动，殖民者以机关枪和刺刀对付和平居民。一九五一年，法国殖民军对摩洛哥居民发动大规模进攻，逮捕了三万五千多人。为了镇压突尼斯和阿尔及利亚的民族解放斗争，法国殖民者派了大批军队进行所谓
  “清剿”和“扫荡”。法国殖民者对北非人民的血腥镇压，使用了美国供给的飞机和大炮，并得到美国军队的直接帮助。英国殖民者镇压怯尼亚人民的血腥行动，尤其令人发指。从一九五二年十月到一九五三年十月，英国殖民当局在怯尼亚杀害了五千多名非洲人，目前已有八万多人被关进了集中营。但是殖民主义者这种惨无人道的暴行，并没有能把非洲人民要求独立解放的斗争镇压下去，而是激起了人民更大的愤恨。
    非洲人民争取民族独立和解放的斗争，得到了全世界一切进步人类的同情和支持。法国对北非人民的镇压，首先遭到阿拉伯国家人民的反对。阿拉伯国家曾多次向联合国大会建议解决北非问题，这些提案首先得到苏联的大力支持。一九五二年亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议所通过的“关于民族独立问题的决议”中，强烈反对种族歧视。一九五三年世界工会联合会发表声明，对怯尼亚非洲人民所遭受的待遇表示抗议。最近举行的亚洲国家会议所通过的决议中，也对殖民主义和种族歧视政策表示斥责。在目前正在举行的亚非会议中，人权和自决权以及附属国的问题已被列入议程，亚非人民要求民族独立和平等的普遍愿望，无疑将在这个会议中得到进一步的相互支持和鼓舞。
    争取民族独立和解放的火焰已在非洲大陆上燃烧起来。被称为“黑暗大陆”的非洲已再不是帝国主义可以随心所欲地进行掠夺和对当地人民施行奴役的场所了。非洲人民必然会挣脱帝国主义的桎梏，最后获得自由和解放。
