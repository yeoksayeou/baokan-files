Jixi Coal Mine's Mashan Mine in Heilongjiang is known for producing excellent coking coal. In the past, thick and medium coal seams were often mined in two layers. As a result, after the upper layer was mined, the lower layer was damaged, wasting a lot of underground resources. In order to avoid waste, Mashan Mine began piloting the "one-time full-height mining" method (that is, mining the entire seam at once) in No. 5 mine in November 1954. Over the past five months, technicians and workers have overcome technical difficulties such as raising the roof, and finally successfully completed the experiment recently. According to the statistics of one coal mining face on the second road of Mashan Mine No. 5 alone, 15,000 tons of raw coal were mined due to the adoption of the "one-time full-height mining" method.

Now, this new coal mining method is being gradually and comprehensively promoted on all thick and medium coal seam working faces in Mashan Mine.

    鸡西麻山矿推行新的采煤法
    黑龙江鸡西煤矿麻山矿是以产优良的炼焦煤著称的。过去在中厚煤层上，经常用分两层采的方法，结果采了上层，下层就被破坏，浪费了大量地下资源。麻山矿为了避免浪费，一九五四年十一月在五井试行“一次采全高”采煤法（就是一次把这层煤全部采出来），五个月来，技术人员和工人们克服了架高顶子等技术困难，终于在最近完全试验成功。仅据麻山矿五井二路一个采煤工作面的统计，因为采用“一次采全高”采煤法就多采出了一万五千吨原煤。
    现在，这个新采煤方法正在麻山矿全矿中厚煤层工作面上逐步全面推广。
