Labor Reform of Criminals
Zhang Chong

The March sun dried the starched white gauze, and a dozen people were taking these white gauzes off the rows of wooden frames and sending them to the roving room. The rhythmic sounds of looms and sock machines echoed through the brick walls of the factory building. From the glass skylights of the dyeing room, puffs of white steam rose from time to time, soaring into the sky... This is a scene of labor, very much like an ordinary factory.

However, this is a place where criminals are detained - the Beijing People's Court Prison.

Beijing Prison, this is an organ for punishing criminals. Various criminals are sent here by the People's Government to be transformed into citizens beneficial to society through labor reform and political education. Those who are released from here have become builders of tall buildings, handicraftsmen who make daily necessities for the people, some have entered school, and some have opened shops. Some women have returned home to take care of their families.

In the Beijing Prison Sock Factory, the prisoners are working quietly. There is no dust here, plenty of sunshine, and the room is heated. Prisoners patrol back and forth in front of the machines. The prisoners here have learned the technology, and skilled people are in charge of fourteen sock machines each. Yang Yuhui often walks around in this workshop, bending down to listen to the sound of the machine running, or helping prisoners repair parts. He was originally an officer of the reactionary faction. When he was released after serving his sentence, he asked to stay in the factory. After approval, he is now a mechanical repairman.

Semi-finished socks are moved by prisoners to another workshop. Here, dozens of prisoners use lockstitch machines to sew the toes of the socks. In the northwest corner against the wall, there are three older prisoners. This is the Zhang Dianjin group. They have achieved the highest record by locking more than one hundred and ten dozen socks every day, receiving bonuses, and Zhang Dianjin has had his sentence shortened. The finished products are also inspected by prisoners, who sit in two rows on either side of long worktables.

In the dyeing workshop, prisoners are stirring socks and raw yarn in dyeing vats. Most of the technicians responsible for color matching are hired from outside, but one of them, Yang Zengshou, was originally a Kuomintang reactionary agent. During the period of labor reform, he learned this skill and fell in love with this job. So, when he was released in 1952, he also voluntarily requested to stay.

The woven socks become dazzling from the dyeing workshop, are sent to the baking workshop, and then after final inspection, pressing, and packaging, they are sent to the market.

Leaving the sock factory and crossing a courtyard, you arrive at the weaving factory. This is also a place where labor is used to reform prisoners. The prisoners start all the looms, and the shuttle rapidly moves back and forth with the weft thread, and the woven cloth slowly stretches out. On the wall of a workshop, prisoners wrote in large characters with red and white chalk: "Learn from the classes, groups, and individuals who overfulfill their plans!" "Prevent accidents, prevent substandard cloth, not only exceed the quota, but also create new records!" Jin Shihua class, Yuan Qingxiao, Zhao Zenglu, and others in the weaving factory have become role models for prisoners to learn from. The cloth is carried by prisoners to the room next door. Several prisoners concentrate on trimming the edges of each bolt of cloth with small scissors.

Those who do not know the background would hardly imagine that these people were once criminals who specialized in harming the people. They were certainly not born like this, but the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang turned them into or forced them to become criminals.

Li Songyin, a forty-three-year-old prisoner who sizes yarn, is a habitual thief who has committed crimes for more than ten years. But he was originally an ordinary poor peasant in Tongxian County, Hebei, and only knew how to grow crops before the age of twenty-four. Later, he went down the coal mine as a miner. Low wages made it difficult for him to support his family, and brothels and taverns became places for him to relieve his worries. He gradually became depraved and extravagant. At first, he supplied himself by constantly working overtime. Later, he met a habitual thief named Liu Shuhua in the theater and began to steal. Before liberation, he had been in the Kuomintang prison several times. In this hell on earth, where abusing prisoners and embezzlement were considered abilities, he only learned many new stealing skills each time, and stole even more severely after being released. After liberation, he was arrested by the People's Government in December 1950. This time he received different management. Here, there was no torture or abuse, no deduction or exploitation; what there was was the teaching of truth, that is, to let all those who had fallen into crime by deviating from labor return to labor and reform themselves through labor. In labor, Li Songyin slowly regained the labor habits of his youth. And through education, he slowly realized that his past behavior was a crime, because his behavior caused misfortune to many kind people. When he thought that the Communists were creating happiness for the people through hard work and fearlessly sacrificing blood, he felt that his behavior was really shameful. He finally repented. He performed very well in labor. He was determined to stay after serving his sentence and continue to work on sizing yarn, and forever abandon the shameful life of crime.

In the corridor of the prison, several notices for lost pens and clothing were posted on the wall. The things were picked up by prisoners, and the notices were posted by themselves. They are no longer willing to steal the fruits of other people's labor. The habitual thief Zhao Runtian is burning a boiler in the boiler room. In the past, the property of many people had been taken away by him for his enjoyment, but now he bends down to pick up small pieces of coal mixed in the furnace ash. Because he has labored himself, he understands that even a small piece of coal is obtained through labor.

The revolutionary humanitarian spirit of the People's Government in treating criminals is also reflected in the daily life of the prisoners. The prisoners in Beijing Prison live a regular life. They get up, work, study, eat, rest, and entertain themselves on time. The prisoners work nine hours a day and sleep eight hours. There are two hours of current affairs study every day. Prisoners with low education levels participate in cultural classes. Yang Deshun, a prisoner, had no one in his family who had ever attended school for four generations, but now he has the opportunity to study. Many who were originally illiterate are now able to recognize one thousand five or six hundred characters. A small library is specially set up for prisoners. The library has more than 4,000 magazines alone. Literary novels and pamphlets such as "New Outlook on Life" and "How to Reform Ideology" are books that prisoners often borrow. Many covers of the latter type of books have been replaced with kraft paper. The three electric mills in the prison are rolling all day to grind grain for the prisoners. The prisoners grind their own tofu and grow green vegetables as non-staple food. A green ping-pong table is propped up at the entrance of a dormitory. There are six basketball courts in the various squares of the prison. After labor and study, the prisoners exercise here. The prisoners themselves designed and built two stages. On the eve of every holiday, they often perform programs arranged by themselves here. This year, on the "March 8th" International Women's Day, female prisoners took a day off and watched a movie in front of the stage at night.

The three tile houses of the prison supply and marketing cooperative are located in the center of the courtyard. A row of long glass cabinets and shelves are filled with various daily necessities and stationery. Socks produced by the prison are sold at wholesale prices. Prisoners can come here to buy supplies according to their needs, without any restrictions. From January to March 20 this year, prisoners bought 501 pens from the supply and marketing cooperative.

The old society's prisons gave the impression of being damp and dirty, and the prisoners were disheveled. Now the prisoners in Beijing Prison live a clean and hygienic life. The rooms and courtyards are swept very clean. Pictures educating prisoners about hygiene are hung on the walls of the prisoner dormitory. The beds are folded neatly. After eating, the prisoners wash their bowls and chopsticks clean, put them in the cupboard, and then hang a white dust-proof cloth. Prisoners take a bath once every half month.

Sick prisoners can get appropriate medical treatment here. The clinic of Beijing Prison has five doctors going to the prisoners for rounds every day. Recently, the doctors are giving all prisoners physical examinations. Seriously ill prisoners are isolated and do not participate in any labor, but specialize in recuperation.

The policy of implementing labor reform for criminals embodies the great revolutionary humanitarian spirit of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government. The implementation of this policy is to transform the sinners created by the old society into new people, so that they can consciously abide by the law and support themselves after labor reform. All the Chinese people understand the correctness and greatness of this policy, and some people even voluntarily send their thieving children to the People's Government for education. They fully trust their government and hope to see their children become people with new morals after being educated by the government. Now, the hooligan Wang Shaochun, the thief Sun Guanghui, and five or six other prisoners in Beijing Prison were all voluntarily sent by their relatives for reform. And they have indeed made progress now.

### 对罪犯的劳动改造

    对罪犯的劳动改造
    张重
    三月的太阳晒干了过浆的白纱，十多个人正从一排排的木架上把这些白纱取下来，送到落纱间去。织布机和织袜机有节奏的声音，透过厂房的砖壁。染色房的玻璃天窗里，不时冒出一股股白色的蒸气，直冲天空……这里是一片劳动的景象，很像是一个普通的工厂。
    然而这里是拘押罪犯的地方——北京市人民法院监狱。
    北京监狱，这是一个惩治罪犯的机关。各种罪犯被人民政府送来这里，用劳动改造和政治教育的方法，使他们变成有益于社会的公民。从这里释放出去的人，他们有的已经成了高楼大厦的建筑者，有的成了给人民制造生活日用品的手工业者，有的入了学，有的开起商店。有些妇女则回到家里安心地料理家务。
    在北京监狱织袜厂，犯人们静静地工作着。这里没有灰尘，阳光充足，室内有暖气。犯人们来回巡视在机器前面。犯人们在这里学会了技术，技术熟练的人每人看管着十四台织袜机。杨玉慧经常在这个车间里走来走去，俯下身听一听机器运转的声音，或是帮助犯人修理机件。他原是反动派的军官。他在刑满释放的时候，自己要求留在厂里。经过批准，他现在担任了机械修理师。
    半成品的袜子，由犯人搬到另一个车间。在这里，数十个犯人用锁口机把袜头缝了起来。西北角靠墙的地方，有三个年纪较大的犯人。这是张殿金小组。他们因为每天能锁一百一十多打袜子而达到最高纪录，得到奖金，张殿金并减短了刑期。检查成品的也是犯人，他们分两排坐在长长的案板两旁。
    染色车间里，犯人们正在翻搅染色缸里的袜子和原线。负责配色的技术人员多半是由外面聘请来的，但其中一个叫杨增寿的原是国民党反动派的特务。在劳动改造期间，他学会了这门技能，而且爱上了这件工作。于是在一九五二年刑满释放时，他也自动请求留下来。
    织成的袜子从染色车间变得光彩夺目，送到烘烤车间，然后经过最后检查、压平、包装，最后送上市场。
    走出袜厂，穿过一个庭院，就到了织布厂。这里同样是用劳动来改造犯人的地方。犯人们开动了所有的织机，梭子带着纬线急速地穿来穿去，织成的布慢慢地伸长起来。一个车间的墙壁上，犯人们用红白粉笔写着大字：“向超额完成计划的班、组、个人看齐！”“防事故，防次布，既能超额，还能创造新纪录！”织布厂的金世华班、袁庆孝、赵增禄等，都成为犯人学习的榜样。布匹的布由犯人扛到隔壁的房间。几个犯人用小剪刀专心地修整每疋布的边幅。
    不知道根底的人，谁也很难想象这些人过去竟是些专门危害人民的罪犯。他们确实原来也不是生成这样的，而是国民党的反动统治把他们变成或逼成了罪犯。
    四十三岁的浆纱犯人李松印是个作案十多年的惯盗。但他原来只是河北通县的一个普通贫苦农民，二十四岁以前只懂得种庄稼。以后他下煤井当了矿工。低微的工资使他难以养家活口，妓院和酒馆就成了他消愁解闷的地方。他逐渐变得糜烂挥霍起来。起初，他用不断的加班来供应自己。以后他在戏院里结识了一个叫刘树华的惯盗，就开始了偷窃。解放以前他进过几次国民党的监狱。在这个以虐待犯人和贪污受贿为能事的人间地狱里，他每次都只是学会许多新的偷窃本领，出狱以后偷得更加厉害。解放以后，一九五○年十二月他被人民政府逮捕了。这次他受到不同的管理，在这里，没有酷刑和辱骂，没有克扣和盘剥；有的是真理的教诲，这真理就是，让一切脱离了劳动而堕落犯罪的人回到劳动中来，用劳动改造自己。在劳动中，李松印慢慢恢复了青年时期的劳动习惯。而且经过教育，他慢慢明白了自己过去的行为是一种罪恶，因为他的行为给许多善良的人造成不幸。他一想到共产党人都是艰苦奋斗、不怕牺牲流血地为人们创造幸福，就觉得自己的行为实在很可耻。他终于悔悟了。他在劳动中表现得很好。他决心在刑满之后留下来继续作浆纱的工作，永远放弃那种犯罪的耻辱的生活。
    在监狱的走廊里，墙壁上贴着好几张招领纲笔、衣物的便条。东西是犯人拾到的，便条是他们自己张贴的。他们现在已经不再愿意偷窃别人的劳动果实了。惯盗赵润田在锅炉房烧火，过去有许多人的许多财产曾经被他夺去享用，现在他弯下腰拣着夹杂在炉灰里的一小块一小块的煤。因为他自己劳动了，他懂得一小块煤也是劳动得来的。
    人民政府对待罪犯的革命人道主义精神，还体现在犯人的日常生活上。北京监狱的犯人，过着有规律的生活。他们按时起床，劳动，学习，吃饭，休息和娱乐。犯人每天劳动九小时，睡眠八小时。每天有两小时的时事学习。文化程度低的犯人参加了文化班。犯人杨德顺家里四辈子都没有一人进过学校，而现在他得到了学习的机会。许多原来是文盲的，现在有的已能认一千五、六百字。一个小型的图书室专为犯人而设。图书室仅杂志就有四千多册。文艺小说以及“新人生观”、“怎样改造思想”一类的小册子都是犯人常借的书。后一类书的许多封皮都用牛皮纸重新换过。监狱里的三盘电磨，整天滚动着为犯人磨制粮食。犯人们自己磨豆腐，种青菜，作为副食品。一个宿舍的入口处支着一张绿色的乒乓球案子。监狱里的各个广场上，共有六个篮球场。在劳动、学习之后，犯人们在这里锻炼身体。犯人们自己设计和修建了两座舞台。每逢休假日的前夕，他们常常在这里演出自己编排的节目。今年“三八”国际妇女节，女犯人白天休假，夜晚又在舞台前面看电影。
    监狱供销社的三间瓦房设立在庭院中心。一排长长的玻璃柜里和货架上摆满各种日用品和文具。监狱出产的袜子，按照批发价出售。犯人们可以按自己的需要到这里来买用品，而不受到任何限制。从今年一月到三月二十日，犯人从供销社买去的钢笔就有五百零一支。
    旧社会的监狱给人的印象是阴湿肮脏，犯人是蓬头垢面。现在北京监狱的犯人却过着清洁卫生的生活。室内和院落都洒扫得非常清洁。犯人宿舍的墙壁上挂着教育犯人讲卫生的画图。床被叠得整整齐齐。犯人在吃饭之后，自己把碗筷刷洗干净，放进碗橱，然后挂上防尘的白色罩布。犯人每半月洗澡一次。
    患病的犯人在这里能够得到适当的医疗。北京监狱的医务所每天有五个大夫到犯人中去巡诊。最近大夫们正给全体犯人进行体格检查。患重病的犯人被隔离开来，不参加任何劳动，专事疗养。
    对罪犯实行劳动改造的政策，体现了中国共产党和人民政府的伟大的革命人道主义精神，实行这种政策就是要把旧社会制造出来的罪人改造成为新人，使他们能够经过劳动改造，自觉守法，自食其力。全中国人民都懂得这个政策的正确伟大，有些人甚至把自己的偷窃成性的子女自动送交人民政府管教。他们充分信赖自己的政府，希望看到自己的子女经过政府的管教而变成具有新品德的人。现在北京监狱的流氓王绍存、小偷孙光辉以及另外五、六个犯人，都是被他们的亲人自动送来改造的。而他们现在也确乎有了长进。
