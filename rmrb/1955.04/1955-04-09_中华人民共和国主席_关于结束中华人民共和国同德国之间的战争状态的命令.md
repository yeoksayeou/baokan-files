    Due to Hitler's Germany launching a fascist war of aggression that destroyed world peace and supporting Japan's war of aggression against China, China declared itself in a state of war with Germany on December 9, 1941. After the Hitlerite aggressors were eliminated, the Potsdam Conference of 1945 decided that Germany should develop into a peaceful, democratic, and unified country, and determined the path for concluding a peace treaty with Germany.

    However, due to the consistent policy of the United States, Britain, and France to split Germany, revive West German militarism, and join aggressive military blocs, Germany remains divided, and a peace treaty with Germany has yet to be concluded. Now, the United States, Britain, and France are actively attempting to further obstruct the peaceful reunification of Germany and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany by implementing the Paris Agreements which is posing a serious threat to peace and security in Europe.

    The People's Republic of China firmly supports the German Democratic Republic and the entire German people, as well as the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries and peoples, in their struggle to achieve the peaceful reunification of Germany, promote the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, ensure European collective security, and safeguard world peace. At the same time, for the benefit of the Chinese people and the entire German people, and in accordance with the resolution of the Ninth Session of the Standing Committee of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China on April 7, 1955, it is hereby declared:

    1. The state of war between the People's Republic of China and Germany is hereby terminated. Peaceful relations between the two countries should be established.

    2. The termination of the state of war between the People's Republic of China and Germany does not change Germany's international obligations. At the same time, it does not affect the rights enjoyed and the obligations undertaken by the People's Republic of China in accordance with relevant international agreements concerning Germany.

                                  Chairman of the People's Republic of China Mao Zedong
                                    April 7, 1955

    中华人民共和国主席
    关于结束中华人民共和国同德国之间的战争状态的命令
    由于希特勒德国发动破坏世界和平的法西斯侵略战争和支持日本对中国的侵略战争，中国于一九四一年十二月九日宣布同德国处于战争状态。希特勒侵略者被消灭以后，一九四五年的波茨坦会议决定了德国应当发展成为和平、民主、统一的国家和缔结对德和约的途径。
    但是由于美、英、法三国一贯奉行分裂德国、使西德复活军国主义和加入侵略性的军事集团的政策，德国仍然处于分裂状态，对德和约仍然未能缔结。现在美、英、法三国积极图谋通过实施巴黎协定进一步阻挠德国和平统一和缔结对德和约，使欧洲的和平和安全受到严重的威胁。
    中华人民共和国坚决支持德意志民主共和国和全德人民以及苏联和所有爱好和平的国家和人民为争取德国和平统一、促进对德和约的缔结、保障欧洲集体安全和维护世界和平的斗争，同时为了中国人民和全德人民的利益，现根据中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会常务委员会一九五五年四月七日第九次会议的决议，宣布：
    一、中华人民共和国同德国之间的战争状态从此结束。两国之间的和平关系应当建立起来。
    二、中华人民共和国同德国之间的战争状态的结束并不改变德国的国际义务。同时并不影响中华人民共和国根据有关德国的国际协定而享有的权利和承担的义务。
                                  中华人民共和国主席  毛泽东
                                    一九五五年四月七日
