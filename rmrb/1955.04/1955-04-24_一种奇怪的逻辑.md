     A Strange Logic
To the Editor:
    I am a cadre in a district-level organization. From my daily work and life, I deeply feel that educating cadres and the masses to cherish public property and oppose waste and destruction is an arduous and meticulous task.
    Taking our district as an example: In the spring of 1952, the district people's government preserved more than 70 telegraph poles belonging to the local garrison. By the first half of 1954, they were completely gone, and no one knew where they went. In the past, the district made a batch of new chairs, stools, and bed boards, but later the old ones slowly disappeared; now the newly made chairs are also gradually damaged. As for the glass in the doors and windows of offices, meeting rooms, and dormitories, no one knows how much is damaged each year.
    The damage or loss of public property is indeed infuriating, but what is even more infuriating is the attitude of many people towards this issue. Some people damage public property themselves and say nonchalantly: "It's the public's, what's there to be afraid of?", "Out with the old, in with the new!"; some people are dissatisfied when others offer suggestions to them, saying: "This isn't yours, why are you so concerned?", "Eat more and mind your own business!"; even more people retort when others mention that it is public property: "People belong to the public, let alone these things!", "What does this count for? To the public, it's just a drop in the ocean, and I didn't do it intentionally," and so on.
    From these people's conversations, it seems that one can derive the following logic: because it is public property, it can be damaged or lost at will; if it is damaged or lost, it can be ignored, and if someone asks or interferes, it is "meddling"; there is a lot of public property, so as long as it is not a conscious action, it doesn't matter if it is damaged or lost.
    This is truly a strange logic! These comrades seem to have forgotten: "The public property of the People's Republic of China is sacred and inviolable. It is the duty of every citizen to cherish and protect public property." (Article 101 of the Constitution) They also seem to have forgotten that "thrift" is the fundamental method for socialist countries to accumulate funds for industrialization.
    In order to save every bit of capital to build socialism, I hope that everyone will fight against this phenomenon of not cherishing public property.

### 一种奇怪的逻辑

     一种奇怪的逻辑编辑同志：
    我是一个区级机关的干部。从我的日常工作和生活中，深深感到教育干部和群众爱护公共财物、反对浪费和破坏，是一件艰巨的细致的工作。
    就拿我们这个区的情况来说吧：一九五二年春天，区人民政府保存了当地驻军的七十多根电线杆子，到一九五四年上半年已经完全没有了，问谁谁也不知道。过去区里做了一批新的椅子、凳子和床板，后来旧的就慢慢的不知去向了；现在新做的椅子也逐渐损坏。至于办公室、会议室、宿舍门窗上的玻璃，那就更不知每年要弄坏多少。
    公共财物损坏或失落了的确很使人生气，但更加使人生气的是许多人对待这个问题的态度。有的人自己损坏了公物还满不在乎地说：“公家的，怕什么”、“旧的不去，新的不来”；有的人当别人对他提出意见时竟不满意地说：“这又不是你的，还用你那么关心”、“你多吃饭，少管这些闲事”；更有一些人甚至当别人一提到这是公物时就反驳说：“人都是公家的，还用说这点东西”、“这算什么，在公家来说不过是沧海一粟，我又不是有意的”等等。
    从这些人的谈话中，似乎可以得出这样一个逻辑：因为是公家的就可以任意损坏或丢失；损坏或丢失了就可以不问不管，如果有人问了管了便是“多管闲事”；公共财物多得很，只要不是有意识的行动，损坏了或丢失了也不要紧。
    这真是一个奇怪的逻辑！这些同志们似乎忘记了：“中华人民共和国的公共财产神圣不可侵犯。爱护和保卫公共财产是每一个公民的义务。”（宪法第一百零一条）也似乎忘记了：“节约”是社会主义类型的国家积累工业化资金的根本方法。
    为了节约点滴资金建设社会主义，我希望所有的人都能和这种不爱护公共财物的现象作斗争。
