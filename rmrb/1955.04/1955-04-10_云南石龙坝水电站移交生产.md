    Yunnan Shilongba Hydropower Station Transferred to Production
    The newly built Shilongba Hydropower Station in Yunnan Province was fully transferred to production on April 5th. After this power station is put into production, it basically meets the current needs of industrial production and people's electricity consumption in the Kunming area. It is currently the largest hydropower station in Yunnan Province, and it generates electricity by making full use of the Dianchi Lake water source under the guidance of Soviet experts. After the power station was completed, it underwent three months of temporary operation, which proved that the project quality was good. The power generation is equivalent to one-quarter of the existing power in the Kunming area, exceeding the power generation of the original Shilongba Power Plant, and changing the previous situation of restricted electricity use and alternating power outages in the Kunming area.

    云南石龙坝水电站移交生产
    云南省新建的石龙坝水力发电站，已在四月五日全面移交生产。这个电站投入生产后，基本上满足了目前昆明地区工业生产和人民用电的需要。它是目前云南省最大的水电站，是在苏联专家的指导下，充分利用滇池的水源发电的。电站建成后，曾经经过三个月的临时运转，证明工程质量良好。发电量相当于昆明地区现有电力的四分之一，超过原石龙坝发电厂的发电量，改变了昆明地区以前限制用电和轮流停电的状况。
