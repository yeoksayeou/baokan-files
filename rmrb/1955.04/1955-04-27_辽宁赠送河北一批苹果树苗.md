Liaoning Province donated 150,000 apple saplings to farmers in Hebei Province to support the development of fruit tree production in mountainous areas of Hebei Province. This batch of apple saplings has now been transported to Hebei and distributed to farms and agricultural producers' cooperatives in seven special districts, including Shijiazhuang, Baoding, and Handan. The farmers are very fond of these apple saplings and are actively digging pits to plant them, vowing to "plant one and have it live," to thank the friendship of the farmer brothers in Liaoning Province. It is expected that these apple trees will blossom and bear fruit in large quantities by 1962.

    辽宁赠送河北一批苹果树苗
    辽宁省赠送给河北省农民十五万株苹果树苗，支持河北省农民发展山区果树生产。现在这批苹果树苗已经运到河北，并已分配给石家庄、保定、邯郸等七个专区的农场和农业生产合作社。农民们非常喜欢这些苹果树苗，现正积极刨坑栽培，并提出要争取“栽一棵活一棵”，以答谢辽宁省农民兄弟的友谊。预计这批苹果树到一九六二年即可大量开花结果。　（梁兆武）
