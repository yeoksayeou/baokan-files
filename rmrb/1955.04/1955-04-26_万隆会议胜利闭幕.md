    The week-long Asian-African Conference victoriously concluded on the evening of the 24th. The historically significant joint communiqué adopted by the conference expressed the common will of the people of Asian and African countries, representing more than half of the world's population, to maintain peace, oppose colonialism, and promote friendly cooperation.
    The resolutions unanimously adopted by the conference reflected the feelings of mutual understanding, solidarity, and cooperation among Asian and African countries. During these days, people strongly felt this sentiment here. This could be felt both from the speeches of representatives of many countries at the conference, from the frequent friendly meetings between delegations from various countries outside the conference, and from the contacts between reporters and representatives of many countries. It was the first time in history that so many Asian and African countries had gathered together. It is undeniable that the specific situations of the countries are different, and the ideological systems and religious beliefs of the representatives of the countries are different, but these differences, which the American propaganda machine has tried its best to exaggerate, have not hindered the unity between the majority of Asian and African countries. Their common experience of suffering long-term colonial oppression has enabled them to have a deep understanding of each other. The common desire to maintain world peace and friendly cooperation and to oppose colonialism has linked them together.
    Seeking common ground while reserving differences was the main spirit that pervaded the conference. This spirit was embodied in the speeches of Indonesian President Sukarno and Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo on the first day of the conference. Premier Zhou Enlai repeatedly emphasized in his speech at the conference that the conference should affirm the common aspirations and demands of the participating countries and avoid getting bogged down in disputes. Representatives from India, Burma, and other countries also advocated doing so in the conference discussions. It was precisely this spirit that dominated, enabling the conference to achieve great success.
    The achievement of common resolutions at the conference was not smooth sailing. During the conference, especially in the meetings of the Political Committee, there were currents and counter-currents. It is remembered that in the first two days of the conference, representatives from a few countries participating in the American military alliance—Iraq, Thailand, and the Philippines—deviated from the main spirit of the conference, making remarks against peaceful coexistence and slandering communism, which only benefited those imperialists who attempted to split the Asian and African people. Some self-proclaimed American "observers" here immediately shouted with joy that "disputes" had appeared at the conference and that there was a "tendency to break up." However, these so-called "challenges," which were published in full on the front pages of American newspapers, were not well received in Bandung. Representatives from most Asian and African countries expressed dissatisfaction. On the contrary, Premier Zhou Enlai's speech, advocating that everyone seek unity and avoid disputes, deeply touched people's hearts and won universal praise from representatives of various countries. The American "observers" were disappointed to see that their "first shot," which they had spent a long time preparing, had not worked, and they then began to talk about "organizing a counterattack."
    Next, Ceylonese Prime Minister Kotelawala suddenly held a press conference on the 21st, making anti-communist remarks and a statement on the Taiwan issue. American reporters here immediately filled their reports with words such as "disagreement," "disunity," and "stalemate" regarding the conference. Cheers also came from Washington. However, Kotelawala's statement was met with cold treatment and stern criticism among the representatives of most Asian and African countries. Other Colombo countries that initiated the Asian-African Conference along with Ceylon also publicly expressed dissatisfaction with Ceylon's behavior, which deviated from the purpose of the conference. Some Indian figures complained that Kotelawala's actions were detrimental to the conference's great efforts to maintain Asian and world peace.
    Thus, as a French journalist said, the counterattack by the allies of the United States was unsuccessful. "Their fiery anti-communist speeches lost their effect due to the heavy smell of gunpowder."
    The American activities to sabotage the Asian-African Conference were even more rampant outside the conference hall. Here, a joke was circulating: the United States was not invited to participate in the conference, but it sent "the largest delegation," which was seventy American "reporters." These "reporters" specialized in writing and spreading pessimistic air, exaggerating disagreements, and engaging in provocation. Their guiding principle was: the more chaos, the better. Among these "reporters" were also some individuals with peculiar identities, who were actually not reporters, but could be called "secret envoys." For example, an American Congressman named Powell, who came here under the guise of a "reporter," was such a person. This "reporter" himself constantly held "press conferences," posing as a responsible American official to make statements that stirred up trouble, and even openly demanded that America's "friends actively oppose communism." The bizarre status of this American "reporter" made all the journalists here look at him with surprise, believing that he was actually a special envoy of the US State Department.
    The United States also selected agents it had cultivated from its intelligence agencies in West Germany and rushed them here to spread rumors and slander against the Soviet Union and China's policies of national equality.
    In addition to these direct sabotage activities of various kinds, Washington has not neglected to influence the Asian-African Conference in other ways. On the day before the opening of the Asian-African Conference, US Secretary of State Dulles, after meeting with President Eisenhower, issued a statement deliberately releasing the air that the United States believed the military situation in the Taiwan region was serious, attempting to cause the Asian-African Conference to fall into a debate on the Taiwan issue. However, the Asian-African Conference did not develop according to the wishes of the United States on this point either. Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on easing the tension in the Taiwan region was universally welcomed by representatives of various countries.
    Although the obstructions and sabotage arranged by the United States have failed, it can indeed be said that until the last minute of the conference's imminent closure, the United States was still using every means to promote its conspiracy, and had not given up hope that its conspiracy would succeed. The "New York Herald Tribune" on the 23rd was still touting that "Bandung's divisions are widening," and that "the most constructive achievement of the Bandung Asian-African Conference is its display of disunity." This newspaper urged that the "division between the communist and non-communist world" should not be "ignored." The "New York Times" also said on the 23rd that the United States was very pleased with the "disagreements" that had emerged at the Bandung Conference, and that the "illusion" that the Bandung Conference would issue a common voice had been shattered. Even on the day of the conference's closing, an editorial in the "New York Herald Tribune" still hoped that the Bandung Conference would become "a stage specifically established to display opposing opinions."
    These assertions by American newspapers have now become an excellent mockery of themselves. The results of the Asian-African Conference show that it is not the "illusion" of Asian-African national unity that has been shattered, but the American illusion of creating strife at the conference and causing the conference to break down that has been shattered.
    The results of the Asian-African Conference show that the people of Asian and African countries are united in taking their destiny into their own hands and in maintaining the cause of peace. This has become an irresistible historical trend. Anyone who wants to resist and reverse this trend will inevitably suffer a tragic failure.

### 万隆会议胜利闭幕

    万隆会议胜利闭幕
    新华社特派记者
    历时一周的亚非会议在二十四日傍晚胜利闭幕了。会议通过的具有历史意义的联合公报表达了占世界人口一半以上的亚非国家人民维护和平、反对殖民主义和友好合作的共同意志。
    会议一致通过的决议体现了亚非国家之间互相了解、团结合作的感情。在这些日子中，人们在这里强烈地感觉到这种感情。无论是从许多国家代表在会议上的发言里，从各国代表团之间会外频繁的友好会晤里，还有从记者同许多国家代表的接触里，都可以感觉到这一点。这么多亚洲和非洲国家聚会一堂，在历史上是第一次。不可否认，各国的具体情况是不同的，各国代表们的思想体系和宗教信仰是不同的，但是这些被美国宣传机器竭力渲染的不同并没有妨碍大多数亚非国家间的团结。它们遭受长期殖民压迫的共同经历，使它们之间能够有深切的了解。维护世界和平和友好合作、反对殖民主义的共同愿望把它们联系到一起了。
    求同存异，这是笼罩着会议的主要精神。在第一天会议上，印度尼西亚总统苏加诺和总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约的演说中就体现了这种精神。周恩来总理在会议上的发言一再强调说明了会议应将参加国家的共同愿望和要求肯定下来，避免陷入争论。印度、缅甸和其他国家代表在会议讨论中也都主张这样做。正是这种精神占居压倒的地位，使会议获得了巨大的成就。
    会议的共同决议的达成并不是一帆风顺的。在会议过程中，特别是在政治委员会的会议中，曾经出现了一股又一股的逆流。人们记得，在会议一开始的头两天，就有少数参加美国军事联盟的国家——伊拉克、泰国和菲律宾——的代表在会上背离会议的主要精神，发表了反对和平共处、诬蔑共产主义等只有利于那些企图分裂亚非人民的帝国主义的言论。这里一些自封的美国“观察家们”立即高兴地叫嚷说，会议出现了“争吵”，有“破裂的倾向”。但是，这些被美国报纸用第一版地位全文刊载的所谓“挑战书”，在万隆没有得到好评。大多数亚洲和非洲国家代表表示不满。相反地，周恩来总理主张大家求团结而不要争吵的发言，深深地打动了人们的心弦，获得各国代表的普遍赞扬。美国的“观察家们”失望地看到，他们费了很长时间准备起来的“第一炮”没有奏效，他们于是又谈论起“组织反攻”来。
    接着，锡兰总理科特拉瓦拉在二十一日突然举行了记者招待会，发表了反共谈话和关于台湾问题的声明。这里的美国记者在他们的报道中立即又写满了会议出现“分歧”、“不团结”、“僵局”等字眼。华盛顿方面也传来喝采的声音。但是，科特拉瓦拉的声明在大多数亚非国家的代表中遭到冷淡的待遇和严正的批评。和锡兰一道发起亚非会议的其他科伦坡国家，对于锡兰这种背离会议目的的行径也公开表示不满。一些印度人士抱怨说，科特拉瓦拉的这种作法，是有害于会议为维护亚洲和世界和平而作的巨大努力的。
    这样，正如一个法国记者所说的，美国的盟国的反攻没有成功。“它们那些激烈的反共演说由于火药气味太重而丧失了效果”。
    美国破坏亚非会议的活动，在会议厅以外，就显得更加猖狂了。在这里，流行着这样一个笑话：美国没有得到邀请参加会议，但是，它却派遣了
  “最大的代表团”来，这个“代表团”就是七十个美国“记者”。这些“记者”专门撰写散布悲观空气、渲染分歧、进行挑拨离间的所谓“报道”。他们的行动指针是：唯恐天下不乱。这些“记者”中还有一些身份奇特的人物，他们实际上并不是记者，而是可以称之为“秘密使节”。例如，有一个以所谓“记者”名义来到这里的美国众议员鲍威尔，就是这样的人物。这个“记者”本人居然不断地举行“记者招待会”，俨然以美国负责官员的姿态发表播弄是非的声明，甚至公开要求美国的“朋友积极地反对共产主义”。这个美国“记者”的离奇的地位，使这里的新闻界人士无不侧目相视，认为他实际上是美国国务院的特使。
    美国还从在西德的特务机构里挑选出它豢养的特务分子赶来这里，对苏联和中国的民族平等政策进行造谣诬蔑。
    除了这些形形色色的直接破坏活动外，华盛顿还没有忽略从其他方面来影响亚非会议。在亚非会议开幕的前一天，美国国务卿杜勒斯在同总统艾森豪威尔会谈后，就发表声明，故意放出美国认为台湾地区军事局势严重的空气，企图促使亚非会议陷入关于台湾问题的争论里。但是，亚非会议在这点上也没有按照美国的意图发展。周恩来总理关于和缓台湾地区紧张局势的声明，受到了各国代表普遍的欢迎。
    尽管美国布置的阻挠和破坏着着失败，但是，的确可以说，直到会议即将闭幕的最后一分钟，美国还是在使用一切办法来推行它的阴谋的，而且也还一直没有放弃它的阴谋得逞的希望。“纽约先驱论坛报”二十三日还在鼓吹“万隆的分歧扩大”，
  “万隆亚非会议最有建设性的成就是它的不团结的表现”，这家报纸竭力要求不要“忽视共产主义和非共产主义世界的分裂”。“纽约时报”二十三日也在说，美国对万隆会议上出现的“分歧”非常高兴，万隆会议会发出共同声音的“幻想”破灭了。甚至到会议闭幕的一天，“纽约先驱论坛报”的社论还指望万隆会议成为“一个专门为显示相反意见而建立的舞台”。
    美国报纸的这些断言现在已经成为对于它们自己的绝好嘲弄了。亚非会议的结果表明，并不是亚非国家团结的“幻想”破灭了，而是美国要在会议上制造纷争、使会议破裂的幻想破灭了。
    亚非会议的结果表明，亚非国家人民团结一致地要把命运掌握在自己手中，要维护和平事业。这已经成为不可抗拒的历史潮流。谁要是想抗拒和扭转这种潮流，谁就免不了遭到悲惨的失败。
