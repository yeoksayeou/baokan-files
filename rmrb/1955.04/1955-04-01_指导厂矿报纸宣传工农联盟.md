    Guiding Factory and Mining Newspapers to Promote the Worker-Peasant Alliance

    The Sichuan Daily and the Anhui Daily published newspaper reviews on March 16th and 24th respectively, stating that factory and mining newspapers should regularly promote the idea of the worker-peasant alliance. Many industrial and mining enterprise Party committees and editors of factory and mining newspapers in Sichuan Province do not sufficiently recognize the importance of regularly conducting worker-peasant alliance education among employees. For a long time, they have neglected to promote the worker-peasant alliance in their newspapers. Some people even believe: "Factory and mining newspapers should only report on industry, while farmer newspapers should report on agriculture"; "Factory and mining newspapers only talk about matters within the factory, while matters outside the factory are reported by local newspapers"; "Workers don't like to read about things that don't concern their own factory." The Sichuan Daily criticized these one-sided views in its review, and pointed out that industrial reporting and agricultural reporting are inseparable, and factory and mining newspapers should not limit their vision to their own factories and mines. If factory and mining newspapers educate employees with the idea of the worker-peasant alliance, making workers more aware of their leading position and responsibilities, it will further encourage the enthusiasm of employees and better realize the production mobilization role of factory and mining newspapers. The review also used examples of propaganda from some factory and mining newspapers to illustrate how newspapers should use facts to promote the significance and role of the worker-peasant alliance to employees, and promote the policy of local industry serving the countryside. In its newspaper review, the Anhui Daily pointed out that factory and mining newspapers should change the tendency of only promoting the worker-peasant alliance during the Spring Festival, and demanded that the spirit of the worker-peasant alliance be reflected in many reports, especially economic reports.

    One of the important tasks of factory and mining newspapers is to regularly and deeply promote the idea of the worker-peasant alliance to the masses of employees, and to educate them to consciously struggle to strengthen the worker-peasant alliance. The Sichuan Daily and the Anhui Daily have noticed this problem, and in response to the fundamental shortcomings of factory and mining newspapers in their provinces neglecting the promotion of the worker-peasant alliance, they have put forward suggestions for improvement, which can give them practical help and greatly help to change this weak state of publicity.

    指导厂矿报纸宣传工农联盟
    四川日报和安徽日报先后在三月十六日和二十四日发表了厂矿报纸应经常宣传工农联盟思想的报纸工作述评。四川省的许多工矿企业党委和厂矿报纸的编辑人员，对经常向职工进行工农联盟教育的重要性认识不足，长期以来忽视在报纸上进行工农联盟的宣传。有的人还认为：“工矿报纸只管报道工业，农民报纸才应当去报道农业”；“厂矿报纸只讲厂内的事，厂外的事由地方报纸去报道”；“不是本厂的事，工人不喜欢看”。四川日报在述评中批判了这些片面的看法，并且指出：工业报道和农业报道是不可分割的，决不能把厂矿报纸的视线只放在本厂本矿。如果厂矿报纸以工农联盟思想教育职工，使工人更加认识到自己的领导地位和责任，就会进一步鼓舞职工的劳动热情，更好地实现厂矿报纸的生产鼓动作用。述评还以一些厂矿报纸上的宣传实例，说明了报纸应该怎样通过事实向职工宣传工农联盟的意义和作用，宣传地方工业为农村服务的方针等问题。安徽日报在报纸述评中，指出厂矿报纸应改变只在春节期间宣传工农联盟的偏向，要求在许多报道特别是经济报道中，体现工农联盟的精神。
    厂矿报纸的重要任务之一，就是经常地深入地向职工群众宣传工农联盟的思想，教育他们自觉地为加强工农联盟而斗争。四川日报和安徽日报注意到这个问题，针对本省厂矿报纸忽视工农联盟宣传的根本缺点，提出改进的意见，这就能给予它们以切实的帮助，大大有利于改变宣传中的这一薄弱状况。　（韩均）
