Jiangxi Province's handicraft workers are actively manufacturing and repairing farm tools for farmers to support spring plowing production. In the Ji'an Special District, forty-eight handicraft production cooperatives and one hundred and ninety-eight handicraft production teams have mostly gone to the countryside. The Gujiang Town Ironware Production Cooperative in Ji'an County dispatched twelve people into four teams to the countryside. In one month, they repaired forty-two iron rakes, thirty-six large harrows, six hundred and seventy-three iron shovels, and one thousand and forty-six hoes for the farmers. In the Shangrao Special District, thirty-two handicraft production teams in Yugan County have repaired more than fifteen thousand pieces of various farm tools and newly made more than one thousand five hundred pieces of farm tools for the farmers. Many handicraft production cooperatives and production teams have also signed contracts with agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams for adding and repairing farm tools. After the First Carpentry Production Cooperative in the Third District of Xingan County signed a contract with the First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Maiqi Township, they repaired farm tools for the agricultural production cooperative according to the contract, which not only guaranteed the needs of the agricultural production cooperative but also enabled the carpentry production cooperative to produce in a planned way. The eight mobile farm tool repair teams dispatched by the First Ironware Production Cooperative in Hukou County paid great attention to quality when repairing farm tools for farmers. Once, when the Liu Qiansheng team repaired a weeding rake for farmer Yang Zhonggui in Shuiche Township, the repair was slightly hooked. Yang Zhonggui told the Liu Qiansheng team about this opinion at noon. They didn't even eat lunch and rushed to repair it again, so it didn't delay Yang Zhonggui's afternoon production. The farmers were satisfied with their responsible attitude. (Our correspondent stationed in Nanchang)

    江西手工业者支持农民春耕
      江西省各地手工业者积极为农民制造和修补农具，支持春耕生产。吉安专区四十八个手工业生产合作社、一百九十八个手工业生产小组，大部分都已下乡。吉安县固江镇铁业生产合作社抽出十二个人组成四个小组下乡，一个月就为农民修理好铁耙四十二张、大耙三十六张、铁锹六百七十三把、锄头一千零四十六把。上饶专区余干县三十二个手工业生产小组，已为农民修好各种农具一万五千多件，新制农具一千五百多件。许多手工业生产合作社和生产小组还同农业生产合作社和互助组签订了添置、修补农具的合同。新淦县第三区第一木业生产合作社同麦?乡第一农业生产合作社订立合同以后，按照合同替农业生产合作社修补农具，既保证了农业生产合作社的需要，又使木业生产合作社做到有计划地生产。湖口县第一铁业生产社派出的八个流动农具修配小组，在为农民修理农具时很重视质量。有一次，刘乾升小组给水车乡农民杨忠贵修理锄草耙时修得勾了一点，杨忠贵在中午把这个意见告诉了刘乾升小组，他们中午饭也没有吃就赶着重新修理，结果没有耽误杨忠贵下午的生产。农民们对他们这种负责态度感到满意。（本报驻南昌记者）
