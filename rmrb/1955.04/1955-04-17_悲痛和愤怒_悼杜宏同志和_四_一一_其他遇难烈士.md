    Grief and Anger
    ——In Memory of Comrade Du Hong and the Other Martyrs of the "April 11th" Incident
    Wen Jize
    On the morning of April 12th, I received the news that the "Kashmir Princess" plane had been sabotaged and crashed by American-Chiang Kai-shek special agents. My grief was indescribable. My anger was uncontrollable.

    I thought sadly of all the victims, especially remembering Comrade Du Hong.

    On the eve of Comrade Du Hong's departure from Beijing, I had spoken with him. He was the Deputy Director of the Foreign Broadcasting Editorial Department of Beijing Broadcasting Station and a radio reporter who was going to Bandung to cover the Asian-African Conference. He was so cheerful and full of confidence during our conversation. Who would have thought that he would be viciously murdered by American-Chiang Kai-shek special agents on the way?

    I met Comrade Du Hong in 1944. At that time, he was transferred from the anti-Japanese base area behind enemy lines in North China to work at the Xinhua News Agency in Yan'an.

    Before coming to Yan'an, he had been engaged in propaganda, education, and newspaper editing in the base areas behind enemy lines for several years. According to other comrades, he was always active and enthusiastic in his work in the difficult environment behind enemy lines. During enemy "mopping-up" operations, he often insisted on working until the very end before retreating, and he was always eager to help others. Once, during a march, a comrade fell ill, and he carried him on his back for several miles.

    He worked as an English translator at the Xinhua News Agency. Because he knew shorthand, he also transcribed the Mandarin broadcasts from Radio Moscow. At that time, the Soviet Union was engaged in the Great Patriotic War. The Chinese people were as concerned about the Soviet victories as they were about their own. Comrade Du Hong often transcribed until late at night, until dawn. Some of the war reports on the Soviet-German war and the commentaries on Chinese issues from Radio Moscow that were published in the Yan'an Liberation Daily at that time were transcribed by him.

    At that time, the material conditions in Yan'an were very poor. The batteries for the radio had to be charged with a hand-cranked generator. After finishing his work, Comrade Du Hong also had to crank the generator. For a period of time, he also spun wool as a sideline. When he was cranking the generator and spinning wool, he never felt that life was hard, and a cheerful smile often appeared on his face.

    After he became a reporter and went south with the army in 1947, I did not see him for several years. Last year, he was transferred from the south to Beijing to do broadcasting work. I saw that he still maintained the same spirit of active work and the style of hard work and simplicity as in the past.

    He joined the revolutionary activities when he was in his teens. He never went to university, but he constantly worked hard in the revolutionary ranks. He could do English translation and speak English, mainly by learning diligently in his work. Last year, he covered the news of the Geneva Conference and also served as the Deputy Secretary-General of the All-China Journalists Association. In these tasks, he showed that he was a talented news broadcaster.

    Comrade Du Hong was a good cadre cultivated by the Party for many years. After his death, with a heavy heart, I read through his "Registration Form for Members of the Communist Party of China."

    He wrote:
    "I am determined to fight to the end for the cause of the Party, the cause of communism,
  To give my all, until my dying day."

    He has now gloriously fulfilled his oath to the Party.

    The tragic death of the "April 11th" martyrs has aroused deep grief and immense anger among the people of Asia, Africa, and the whole world. Listen! On April 13th, in Beijing, in Moscow, in Asia, Africa, and Europe, many radio stations, in different languages, were expressing the common grief and indignation of hundreds of millions of people.

    The enemy used brutal, shameless, and despicable means to murder our comrades in the ocean. We, the people of Asia, Africa, and the whole world, must use further united strength to create a滔天巨浪(Taotian Julang - tremendous waves) in the struggle for peace and freedom, and completely submerge and bury the murderers and warmongers.

    悲痛和愤怒
    ——悼杜宏同志和“四·一一”其他遇难烈士
    温济泽
    四月十二号早晨，我得到了“克什米尔公主号”飞机被美蒋特务破坏失事的消息。我的悲痛是难以形容的。我的愤怒是没法抑制的。
    我沉痛地想到了所有遇难的人，特别回忆起杜宏同志。
    在杜宏同志离开北京的前夕，我还和他谈过话。他是北京广播电台对国外广播编辑部副主任，是这次到万隆去采访亚非会议新闻的广播记者。他在谈话的时候，是那末愉快和满怀着信心。谁会料到他在途中竟遭到美蒋特务的恶毒的谋杀。
    我是在一九四四年认识杜宏同志的。当时他从华北敌后根据地调到延安新华社来工作。
    他在到延安以前，在敌后根据地做了好几年宣传教育和报纸编辑工作。听别的同志说，他在敌后艰苦的环境里，工作始终是积极的，热情的。他在敌人“扫荡”的时候，时常坚持工作到最后才撤退，并且总是热忱地帮助别人。有一次，在行军途中，一个同志病了，他背着他跑了好几里路。
    他在新华社做英文翻译工作，因为会速记，又兼抄记莫斯科广播电台的华语广播。当时苏联正在进行着伟大的卫国战争。中国人民像关怀自己的胜利一样关心着苏联的战况。杜宏同志经常抄收到深夜，到天明。当时延安解放日报上登载的一部分苏德战争的战报和莫斯科广播电台关于中国问题的评论的稿子，就是他抄记的。
    当时延安的物质条件很差。收音机用的蓄电池要用手摇马达来充电。杜宏同志在工作做完了以后，还要摇马达。有一个时期，他每天还纺毛线，作为业余生产。他在摇马达和纺毛线的时候，从没有觉得生活的艰苦，而且脸上常常露出愉快的笑容。
    在一九四七年他做了记者随军南下以后，我和他好几年没有见过面。去年，他从南方调到北京来做广播工作。我看到他仍然保持着过去那样积极工作的精神和艰苦朴素的作风。
    他在十几岁的时候就参加了革命活动。他没有进过大学，但是在革命队伍里不断地努力学习。他能做英文翻译，会说英语，主要是在工作中靠自己辛勤努力学会的。他去年采访过日内瓦会议的新闻，又担任了中国记者联谊会副秘书长的职务。在这些工作中，表现出他是一个有才能的新闻广播工作者。
    杜宏同志是党多年培养出来的一个好干部。在他遇难以后，我怀着沉痛的心情，翻阅了他填写的“中国共产党党员登记表”。
    他写着：
    “我决心为党的事业，共产主义事业奋斗到底，
  鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。”
    他现在已经光荣地实现了他对党的誓言。
    “四·一一”烈士不幸惨遭毒手，引起了亚洲、非洲和全世界人民的深切的悲痛和无比的愤怒。听吧！就在四月十三号那一天，在北京，在莫斯科，在亚洲、非洲和欧洲，许多广播电台，用不同的语言倾诉着亿万人民的共同的悲愤。
    敌人用凶暴、无耻、卑劣的手段，把我们的同志们谋杀在海洋里。我们亚洲、非洲和全世界的人民，要用进一步团结的力量，掀起争取和平和自由的滔天巨浪，把谋杀者和战争贩子们彻底地吞没，埋葬干净。
