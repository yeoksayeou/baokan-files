Lavish Auditorium, Bottomless Pit of Money
By our reporter Ji Xichen

In March 1954, the former Southwest Military and Administrative Committee in Chongqing built a grand auditorium modeled after the classical architectural style of Beijing's "Temple of Heaven" and "Tiananmen." In terms of scale, the auditorium building is several times higher and wider than the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests in the Temple of Heaven; the auditorium's "Tiananmen," including the north and south buildings (with attached guest houses), is also much larger than Tiananmen.

Chongqing's "Temple of Heaven"

People say: The Southwest Military and Administrative Committee's auditorium is Chongqing's "Temple of Heaven." To enter this magnificent "Temple of Heaven," one must first pass through the ornate archway in front of the courtyard gate, then ascend 128 stone steps, pass through the seven hanging flower gates of the auditorium's entrance hall, and then gradually ascend to the hall's main hall. Here, there are pillars and walls decorated with Yunnan marble; a stage with over 150,000 yuan spent on decorations; a lounge and dance hall with hanging palace lanterns; and a spacious, 50-meter-high, 46-meter-diameter bulbous auditorium hall. In such a rare hall, one cannot see a single pillar; because on the surrounding reinforced concrete four-story seating area, the "Temple of Heaven"-style hemispherical roof frame is entirely constructed of steel.

The facade art decoration of the building is very luxurious, with green glazed tiles, glazed immortals, and glazed animals covering the roofs of the "Temple of Heaven," "Tiananmen," "Rectangular Pavilion," "Octagonal Pavilion," and the north and south buildings; more than 400 red painted pillars, each as thick as a person's embrace, adorn all the buildings; on the roof of the "Temple of Heaven," there is also a "Great Treasure Dome" covered with brass and gilded. And all the white stone railings surrounding the entire building are sculpted with "Phoenix Pillars." All the rafters, beams, and ceilings are also "carved beams and painted pillars." More than 60 painters spent more than two months depicting various ornate彩画彩画 paintings and patterns, and the gold leaf used for decorating the彩画彩画 paintings alone was worth more than 100 taels of gold. In addition to gold lines and ink lines of various sizes, the彩画彩画 paintings also depict ferocious "golden dragons," and countless water drips from the glazed tile eaves are also sculpted with "dragons." Why, when the people of the whole country are working hard to realize the national industrialization construction, is a large amount of funds still used to build such a luxurious building? Isn't this extravagance and waste?

Of Little Use

According to cadres and engineering technicians who personally participated in the construction of the auditorium: In early 1951, the former Southwest Military and Administrative Committee felt that the Southwest level organs did not have a place to accommodate a large number of people for gatherings, and later felt that there was no place to receive foreign guests and visiting senior cadres, so it allocated funds to build this auditorium and attached guest houses. At that time, due to the massive scale of the project (in the original design, in addition to the current "Temple of Heaven" and "Tiananmen," there were also a parade platform, jade belt bridge, and artificial lake, etc., but they were not approved), Chongqing's construction companies were unable to contract and the estimated price was too high, so the former Southwest Military and Administrative Committee organized its own engineering office, including more than 40 cadres and more than 1,500 workers, and specially built two brick and tile factories, and transferred a PLA engineering battalion to help with earth and stone excavation. In June 1951, ground leveling began, more than 300,000 cubic meters of earth and stone were excavated, Ma'anshan was flattened, part of the Daxi溝 (Gully) was filled, 300 households of residents were relocated, and after two years and six months (construction was once suspended during the "Three-Anti" campaign), the auditorium, which could accommodate 4,500 people, as well as the guest houses and some auxiliary buildings, were basically completed in March 1954.

"The new structure is the 'first in the country' and 'first in East Asia'," boasted Zhang Jiade, the chief engineer of design and construction. However, many soldiers, workers, and cadres criticized in the visitors' opinion book: "The building is really good, but the timing is too early," "The funds should be used to build factories and schools"... People were particularly dissatisfied that they spent a lot of money, but built a building of little use.

Take the auditorium as an example! The circular seating area of ​​the auditorium, because the design only considered the grandeur and beauty inside, without considering the actual use value, so the ends of the four-story seating area all extended into the side and rear of the stage. As a result, some seats in the seating area faced away from or were half-facing the stage. The people listening to the report or watching the show in these seating areas could not see the speaker and actors at all, or could only see part of them. They could not hear the speech clearly, and could not see the acting clearly. The audience sitting on the fourth floor was even more like sitting at the bottom of a well, only seeing the tops of the actors' heads but not their expressions. The stage has no place for scenery and actors to put on makeup. In addition, in order to solve the sound problem, all the doors and windows of the auditorium were not installed with glass, only screens were installed. A large amount of dust, coal ash, and heavy fog flew into the auditorium day and night. Soon after sweeping, the white stone railings and auditorium seats were covered with coal ash (there is a thermal power plant nearby), and the spacious hall was like being in the open air in winter.

In the nine months after the completion of the building, the auditorium held 36 performances and reports by domestic and foreign artistic groups, more than 50 cadre evening parties, and received some foreign guests and a small number of visiting cadres, which had some use. However, due to some limitations of the building itself, except for a few large reports and large gatherings, general reports and gatherings did not need such a spacious place; the guest houses were also too luxurious and not suitable for ordinary cadres to live in. The average number of guests per day did not exceed five, so the actual time of use was very short, and the utilization rate of the entire building was very low. It also requires more than 100,000 yuan in maintenance fees and more than 50 personnel to manage it every year, so the departments that took over it later felt that it was a big "burden."

The Architectural Thought of "China's First"

Perhaps some people think this is a building in the national style? Not entirely. Our attitude towards ancient architectural heritage should not be copying, but critically absorbing its essence, and creating architectural forms suitable for our country's current economic life and loved by the people under the guidance of the advanced socialist architectural thought – applicable, economical, and beautiful. This is the only correct path. This auditorium is far from this principle. It can be seen from many places that the design work is guided by the bourgeois aestheticism of purely pursuing luxury, and the personal fame and fortune thought of pursuing the creation of "China's first" and "East Asia's first" architectural "masterpiece". Therefore, the most consideration in the design is how to work hard on beauty and gorgeousness, and little attention is paid to whether the building itself is applicable and economical. As a result, many unnecessary additional buildings and decorative buildings occupy a large part of the building.

In order to be beautiful, and to have a "Temple of Heaven"-style triple-eaved roof, the designer added a hemispherical roof to the 15-meter-high seating area in the entire 78-meter-high building, making the interior clear height 35 meters, and then added a 15-meter roof frame to the roof steel frame, plus the glazed roof, resulting in more than 30 meters of building space being completely useless. In order to be as beautiful as the ancient palaces of the capital in appearance, a gate tower similar to "Tiananmen" was built on the top of the auditorium's entrance hall and the guest houses on the left and right wings, and four rectangular pavilions, octagonal pavilions, and seven hanging flower gates were all buildings used for decoration. A lot of money was spent on decorative buildings. Just adding a roof to the octagonal pavilion cost 49,680 yuan in labor and material costs. At the same time, due to poor design, there is no safety fire-fighting equipment in such a grand building.

Huge Waste

The project was carried out while construction and design were in progress. It was built and then demolished, demolished and then built, constantly changing the sample and reworking, and the budget was increased seven times, making the entire project a "ride a tiger, hard to get off" "bottomless pit". The investment in the entire project exceeded the original plan by a lot. In terms of earthwork and stonework, due to lack of planning, it was dug and then filled, filled and then dug again. The ground level of the entrance hall was raised by more than one meter after it was built, and many brick and stone materials were buried underground. The structural design was generally conservative, wasting a lot of steel bars and other materials. In addition, due to temporary changes in the platform height, a foot of brick wall was built on the part of the poured cement beams, then 格栅 (lattices) were placed to pave the floor, and then seven layers of waterproof layer were added to make a terrazzo floor. Other stairs, stages, doors and windows, toilets, railings, hall floors, roof corners, etc., were reworked a lot in any part. The entire building structure is also extremely inconsistent. There are steel frame structures and reinforced concrete structures with long service lives, as well as brick and wood structures with shorter service lives, and many decorative buildings are all made of slats with extremely short service lives (such as red pillars), which are extremely easy to damage and require constant money for cultivation and repair.

According to statistics, the utilization coefficient in the main building area of ​​the auditorium and guest houses is very small. A large amount of building area in the auditorium is wasted. There are as many as 730 seats on the seating area that are not installed because they cannot be seen, or are not suitable for people to sit on even if they are installed, so that the number of empty seats is more than all the seats in some theaters. The wide corridors behind each floor of the seating area are wide enough for jeeps to drive.

Still a "Bottomless Pit"

"The form is majestic, but the content is bad." The extremely rough auditorium project, although it has only just been completed, is already covered with scars and loopholes in this magnificent building. The roof of the "Temple of Heaven" leaks when it rains heavily, and cracks and water infiltration have been found in several places on the surface of the seating area platform. The paint and paint on the building have changed color and fallen off, the iron wire screens have rusted and rotted, and the lack of safety fire prevention equipment in the auditorium is also too dangerous... To maintain the auditorium, it is necessary to repair and add equipment again. These few items alone will cost five to six hundred thousand yuan! In addition to this, a large amount of maintenance costs must be spent every year. No wonder the comrades in charge of managing the auditorium said: "Until now, it is still a bottomless pit of money!"

    豪华的大礼堂，花钱的无底洞
    本报记者　纪希晨
    一九五四年三月，原西南军政委员会在重庆仿照北京“天坛”、“天安门”古典的建筑形式盖一座大礼堂；就其规模来讲，礼堂大楼比天坛祈年殿高大宽阔好几倍；礼堂的“天安门”如连南北大楼在内（附设招待所），也要比天安门大得多。
    重庆的“天坛”
    人们都说：西南军政委员会大礼堂是重庆的
  “天坛”。要走进这座金碧辉煌的“天坛”，须先经过院门前华丽的大牌坊，然后向上，走过一百二十八个石阶，经过礼堂门厅的七个垂花大门，才能步步升高到会堂大厅里去。这里有用云南大理石装饰成的柱子和墙壁；有花了十五万余元布置费的大舞台；有悬着宫灯的休息室兼跳舞厅；有空旷的高五十公尺、直径四十六公尺的球茎状的礼堂大厅。在这样一个稀有的大厅里，看不到一根柱子；因为在周围钢筋混凝土的四层楼座上，“天坛”式的半球圆形的屋架是全部用钢结构架成的。
    建筑物的立面艺术装饰十分豪华，绿色琉璃瓦、琉璃仙人、琉璃走兽覆盖着“天坛”、“天安门”、“长方亭”、“八角亭”和南北大楼的屋面；四百多根一搂多粗的红油漆柱，点缀着所有的建筑；在“天坛”屋顶上，还有用黄铜包皮并镀金的“大宝顶”。而围绕着全部建筑的白石栏杆上都塑立着“凤柱”。一切桷子、梁头和天花板也全是“雕梁画栋”。六十多个画工用了两个多月时间，描绘着各种华丽彩画和各色图案，仅用于粉饰彩画的金箔就价值一百多两黄金。彩画中除金线和墨线大小点金外，还绘有张牙舞爪的“金龙”，此外，难以数计的琉璃瓦檐的滴水上也都塑造着“龙”。为什么正当全国人民艰苦奋斗，努力实现国家工业化建设的时候，还把大量资金用来修建如此豪华的建筑呢？这不是铺张浪费是什么？
      用处不大
    据亲身参加修筑礼堂的干部和工程技术人员谈：一九五一年初，原西南军政委员会因感到西南一级机关没有能容纳较多人数的集会场所，后来又感到没有招待外宾和过往高级干部的房子，因而拨款修筑这个大礼堂并附设招待所。当时，由于工程浩大（最初设计中，除现在“天坛”、“天安门”外，还有阅兵台、玉带桥和人造湖等，但未被批准），重庆各建筑公司无力承包和估价过高，原西南军政委员会便自己组织了包括四十多个干部、一千五百多工人的工程处，专门新建了两个砖瓦厂，调来了西南军区工兵营帮助开土石方。一九五一年六月开始平基，挖了三十多万土石方，削平了马鞍山，填平了一部分大溪沟，搬迁了三百户居民，前后经过两年又六个月时间（“三反”中一度停工）终于在一九五四年三月，基本完工了可容纳四千五百人的大礼堂，还有招待所和某些附属建筑。
    “新结构是‘全国首次’‘东亚首次’的建筑。”设计兼施工总工程师张家德这样向人夸耀说。可是不少战士、工人、干部都在参观的意见簿上批评说：“建筑真好，时间太早”、“应该把资金用来修建工厂和学校”……。人们特别不满的是：花了许多钱，却修了一座用处不大的建筑。
    以礼堂为例吧！礼堂的圆形楼座，因为设计时只考虑到里面看起来堂皇、美观，不考虑实际使用价值，所以，四层楼座两端全部伸入了舞台的侧后。结果楼座上的一些座位是背向或半背向着舞台，在这些楼座上听报告或看戏的人们，根本看不见或只能看见部分报告人和演员。讲话听不清，演戏看不明，坐在四层楼上的观众们，更如登天观井一般，只能看见演员的头顶而看不见演员的表情。舞台没有布景和演员化装的地方。加以为了解决声音问题，礼堂全部门窗不安玻璃，只装了窗纱，大量的尘沙、煤灰、大雾日夜飞入礼堂中，扫净不久，白石栏杆和礼堂座椅上便又布满了煤灰（附近有一火电厂），空旷的大厅里，冬天更像置身于露天一样。
    建筑完工后的九个月中，礼堂内举行过三十六次国内外文艺团体演出会、报告会，五十余次干部晚会，招待过一些外宾和少数过往干部，有了一定的用处。但是，由于建筑本身的一些限制，除少数大报告、大集会外，一般报告、集会不需这样空阔的地方；招待所也由于太豪华，不适宜一般干部居住，客人每日平均超不过五个人，所以真正使用的时间很少，整个建筑的利用率很低，每年还得经常需要十多万元维护费和五十多个人员来管理，所以后来接管的部门都感到这是一个大“包袱”。“中国第一”的建筑思想
    也许有人以为这是民族形式的建筑吧？不尽然。我们对待古代的建筑遗产不应是抄袭，而应是批判地吸取其精华，应在先进的社会主义建筑思想——适用、经济、美观的原则指导下，创造出适合于我国当前经济生活、为人民爱好的建筑形式。这是唯一正确的道路。这个礼堂离开这个原则很远。从许多地方可以看出，指导着设计工作的，是资产阶级单纯追求豪华的唯美主义思想，和追求创造
  “全国第一”和“东亚第一”建筑的个人“杰作”的名利思想。所以，在设计时考虑最多的是如何在美观、漂亮方面下功夫，至于建筑本身是否适用，是否经济，则很少去关心。因而，使许多不必要的附加建筑和装饰建筑，占去建筑的很大部分。
    设计者为了美观，为了要有一个“天坛”式的三重檐屋顶，在全部高七十八公尺的建筑中，竟在十五公尺多高的楼座上，再加一个半圆球形屋顶，使室内净空为三十五公尺，又在屋顶的钢屋架上附加十五公尺屋架，再加上琉璃屋面，结果使三十多公尺建筑空间完全没有作用。为了外形上能与首都的古代宫殿比美，在礼堂的门厅及左右两翼招待所的顶上又修起一个类似“天安门”的门楼，四个长方亭、八角亭和七个垂花门等完全为了装饰用的建筑。用于装饰的建筑而花去的钱很多，仅仅八角亭加盖屋顶，就用了工料费四万九千六百八十多元。同时，由于设计不周，在这样一个宏大的建筑中，竟没有一点安全消防设备。
      巨大的浪费
    工程是在边施工、边设计中进行的。修了又拆，拆了又修，不断改样返工，七次追加预算，使整个工程变成“骑虎难下”的“无底洞”，整个工程的投资超过原计划很多。土石方工程方面，由于无计划，挖了又填，填了又挖，门厅地平打好了又升高一公尺多，许多砖石工料被埋于地下。结构设计普遍保守，浪费了许多钢筋和其他材料。此外由于临时变动平台高度，结果在部分已浇灌的水泥梁上，又砌上一尺的砖墙，再摆櫊栅铺楼面，然后再加七层防水层做成磨石地面。其他楼梯、舞台、门窗、厕所、栏杆、大厅地面、屋角等，任何部分都返工很多。全部建筑结构也极不统一，有寿命很久的钢架结构及钢筋混凝土结构，也有寿命较短的砖木结构，而许多装饰建筑则全为寿命极短的板条包成（如红柱），极易损坏，需要不断花钱培修。
    据统计，在礼堂和招待所主要建筑面积中，利用系数很小。礼堂内大量建筑面积被空废着。楼座上因看不见而未安座位，或因安了座位也不宜坐人的就达七百三十多个，致使空位置比一些剧院的全部座位还要多。每层楼座后面的宽大走廊，宽得可以行驶吉普车。
    还是一个“无底洞”
    “形式堂皇，内容恶劣”，十分粗糙的礼堂工程，虽才刚刚完工不久，可是疮疤、漏洞却早已布满这一辉煌的建筑。“天坛”屋顶遇到大雨就有漏雨现象，楼座平台的表皮有几个地方已经发现裂缝灌水了，建筑上的油漆、粉刷变色脱落了，铁丝窗纱部分锈烂了，礼堂没有安全防火设备也太危险了，……为维护礼堂，需要重新补修增加设备，单这几个项目还得花五六十万元哩！除此以外，每年还要支出一大笔维护费用，难怪负责管理礼堂的同志说：“直到如今，它仍是个花钱的无底洞呢！”
