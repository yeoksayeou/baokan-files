China's trade union organization has seen great development in the past year. In 1954, trade union membership reached over 12.45 million, an increase of over 1.4 million compared to 1953, and an increase of over 7 million compared to the first commemoration of "May Day" International Labor Day after the founding of the People's Republic of China. Currently, under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, there are sixteen national industrial trade unions, twenty-five provincial, three directly administered municipal, and one autonomous region's federation of trade unions; grassroots trade union organizations have reached 200,000. The vast number of workers across the country have become a powerful force in the country's socialist construction. In 1954, workers throughout the country extensively and deeply launched labor emulation campaigns, studied and applied many advanced experiences from the Soviet Union and China, and effectively ensured the completion of the national production plan. In that year, workers throughout the country proposed more than 848,600 rationalization proposals in production, an increase of 29.4 percent compared to 1953. Among the more than 463,000 that have been implemented, based on a calculation of only 100,296, the country saved more than 174.31 million yuan in wealth. Workers across the country also modeled compliance with government decrees and actively responded to government calls. In 1954, the amount of National Economic Construction Bonds purchased reached more than 270 percent of the estimated amount.

Due to the workers' growing patriotism and significant contributions to the country's socialist construction, workers have gained great trust and honor among the people of the country. In 1954, labor models such as Zhang Mingshan and Wang Chonglun were among the one hundred people elected as deputies to the First National People's Congress.

Under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party and trade union organizations, the political level, technical skills, and organizational abilities of China's working class have also continuously improved. In 1954, a large number of outstanding workers were promoted to leadership positions in enterprises. Among them, more than 1,300 were promoted to factory director and deputy factory director, more than 7,200 were promoted to workshop director, more than 350 were promoted to engineer, and more than 8,800 were promoted to technician. Grassroots units have also produced thousands upon thousands of labor models and advanced workers. Last year alone, more than 374,000 people across the country were selected as labor models and advanced workers. Last year, a large number of outstanding workers were also transferred to work in Party and state organs. Among them, more than 3,600 were transferred to work in Party committees at all levels, and more than 7,600 were transferred to work in people's government organs at all levels.

    我国工会组织一年来有显著发展
    我国工会组织一年来又有很大发展。一九五四年工会会员已达到一千二百四十五万多人，比一九五三年增加了一百四十多万人，比新中国成立后第一次纪念“五一”国际劳动节时增加了七百多万人。目前，在中华全国总工会领导下，共有十六个全国性的产业工会，二十五个省、三个直辖市和一个自治区的工会联合会；基层工会组织已达二十万个。全国广大职工，成了祖国社会主义建设的强大力量。一九五四年，全国职工广泛深入地展开劳动竞赛，学习和运用苏联和我国的许多先进经验，切实地保证了国家生产计划的完成。这一年，全国职工在生产中共提出八十四万八千六百多件合理化建议，比一九五三年增加了百分之二十九点四。在已经执行的四十六万三千多件中，仅据十万零二千九百六十六件计算，就为国家节省了一亿七千四百三十一万多元的财富。全国职工并模范地执行政府法令，积极响应政府号召，一九五四年认购国家经济建设公债的数字就达到了预计额的百分之二百七十以上。
    由于职工们日益增长的爱国主义精神和对于祖国社会主义建设的重大贡献，职工们在全国人民中获得了极大的信任和荣誉。一九五四年有劳动模范张明山、王崇伦等一百人被选为第一届全国人民代表大会代表。
    在共产党和工会组织的领导和帮助下，我国工人阶级的政治水平、技术素养和组织能力也不断地提高了。一九五四年，大批优秀的工人被提拔担任了企业的领导职务。其中被提拔为正副厂长的有一千三百多人，提拔为车间主任的有七千二百多人，提拔为工程师的有三百五十多人，还有八千八百多人被提拔为技术员。基层单位并涌现出了成千上万的劳动模范和先进工作者，去年一年全国被评选为劳动模范和先进工作者的就达三十七万四千多人。去年一年还有大批的优秀职工被输送到党和国家机关中工作。其中输送到中共各级党委工作的有三千六百多人，输送到各级人民政府机关工作的有七千六百多人。
