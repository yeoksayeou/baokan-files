Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, 12th dispatch from TASS: Delhi Radio broadcast a recorded speech by Pham Van Dong, Vice Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, addressed to the Indian people.

He said, I am very happy and honored to have the opportunity to express the respect and fraternal friendship of the people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the great Indian people. ...The Vietnamese people will always remember the moral support given by the Indian people in their struggle for independence and freedom. We have also not ignored the constructive role India played in the results of the Geneva Conference. We have not forgotten India's contribution in fulfilling the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina.

Pham Van Dong continued, the Vietnamese people firmly oppose all aggressive conspiracies, especially the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. For the Vietnamese people, the struggle to consolidate the restored peace simultaneously means the struggle for unification, and the struggle for unification means the struggle for lasting peace in Indochina. The people of North and South Vietnam dream of achieving unification on the basis of free general elections as stipulated in the Geneva Accords.

We are fully aware that in the current situation in Indochina and the world, the struggle for our unification is arduous. But we are strong because our people are of one mind, and all of our people are closely united around President Ho Chi Minh. We are strong because peace-loving people all over the world who are fighting for justice, including the great Indian people to whom I am speaking, give us their support.

We will make every effort to develop relations between the Republic of India and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, for the sake of peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

    范文同副总理向印度人民发表谈话
    新华社十三日讯　塔斯社德里十二日讯：德里电台广播了越南民主共和国副总理范文同向印度人民发表的一篇录音谈话。
    他说，我很高兴和荣幸，有机会向伟大的印度人民表达越南民主共和国人民的敬意和兄弟般的友情。……越南人民永远记得在他们争取独立和自由的斗争中，印度人民所给予他们的道义上的支持。我们也没有无视印度在日内瓦会议的结果中所起的建设性的作用。我们并没有忘记，印度在履行关于停止印度支那敌对行动协定方面的贡献。
    范文同继续说，越南人民坚决反对一切侵略阴谋，特别是反对东南亚条约组织。对越南人民来说，为巩固恢复了的和平而进行的斗争同时意味着争取统一的斗争，争取统一的斗争意味着争取印度支那的持久和平的斗争。北越和南越人民梦寐以求的就是在日内瓦协定所规定的自由普选的基础上实现统一。
    我们完全知道，在目前印度支那和全世界的局势中，争取我们统一的斗争是艰巨的。但是我们是强有力的，因为我们的人民是一心一意的，我们全体人民把他们的队伍紧密地团结在胡志明主席的周围。我们是强有力的，因为正在为正义而斗争的全世界爱好和平的人民，包括我正在向他们发表谈话的伟大的印度人民在内，给予我们支持。
    我们将进行一切努力，在和平共处的五项原则的基础上，为了东南亚和全世界和平的利益，发展印度共和国和越南民主共和国的关系。
