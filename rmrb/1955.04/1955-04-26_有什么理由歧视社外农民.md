What Reason Is There to Discriminate Against Farmers Outside the Cooperative?
    Chen Ji
    Agricultural production cooperatives should become the core for uniting surrounding farmers. Members of agricultural production cooperatives should enthusiastically help and lead farmers outside the cooperative to do a good job in production and jointly develop agricultural production. However, recently some members of newly established agricultural production cooperatives in Hunan Province not only do not unite with and help farmers outside the cooperative, but instead despise mutual aid teams and ridicule individual farmers. In Pingjiang County, an agricultural production cooperative shouted slogans during fertilizer accumulation, calling for "defeating mutual aid teams and crushing individual households." Another agricultural production cooperative's members, while carrying pond silt, arbitrarily trampled to death the rapeseed in the fields of individual farmers because they wanted to take a shortcut; in order to repair the field ridges within the cooperative, they also dug away large stones from the field ridges of mutual aid team members. Some agricultural production cooperatives are constantly arguing and fighting with mutual aid teams and individual farmers over fertilizer. Some members, when they saw individual farmers, would pinch their noses and say sarcastically: "Go away, go away, 'individual work stink' is here!" Many members act like veterans, saying "Mutual aid teams are just a temporary thing, there's no future in them." As a result, mutual aid teams and individual farmers are very dissatisfied with agricultural production cooperatives, saying "Agricultural production cooperatives have become kings," and "Only cooperative members are good, we are all bad," harboring antagonistic emotions towards agricultural production cooperatives.
    Although this situation is not universal, it is very serious and should attract everyone's attention. It must not be allowed to develop further. If this situation is allowed to continue, it will affect the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement and hinder the progress of spring plowing.
    The occurrence of this situation shows that some regions, in the work of establishing agricultural production cooperatives, have not fully grasped and implemented the Party's policies, and have not regarded the work of running cooperatives as a driving force for guiding all farmers forward. Naturally, there is no question of ideologically educating the members of agricultural production cooperatives to enable them to unite the mutual aid teams and individual farmers well. Therefore, the above-mentioned erroneous phenomena are difficult to avoid.
    In order to correct the erroneous attitude and behavior of some agricultural production cooperatives towards mutual aid teams and individual farmers, the leading organs in these areas must fully implement the Party's policies and strengthen the socialist education of the members of agricultural production cooperatives. Every member must understand that the socialist principle is that the advanced helps the backward, the big helps the small, and the strong helps the weak, and not that the advanced bullies the backward, the big bullies the small, and the strong bullies the weak. Since agricultural production cooperatives are an advanced banner for taking the socialist road, they should treat farmers outside the cooperative with a socialist spirit, and should enthusiastically care for and help them, guiding them to move forward together. Every member of an agricultural production cooperative must understand that discriminating against and ridiculing farmers outside the cooperative is very wrong and incompatible with the socialist principle of the advanced helping the backward. Only by uniting with farmers outside the cooperative and doing a good job in production together can we consolidate and develop agricultural production cooperatives and realize the socialist transformation of agriculture.

    有什么理由歧视社外农民
    陈迹
    农业生产合作社应该成为团结周围农民的核心，农业生产合作社的社员应该满腔热情地帮助和带动社外农民做好生产工作，共同发展农业生产。但最近湖南省一些新建立的农业生产合作社的社员不仅不团结和帮助社外农民，反而轻视互助组，讥笑单干农民。平江县有个农业生产合作社，在积肥工作中，社员们高呼口号，要“战胜互助组，打垮单干户”。另有一个农业生产合作社的社员挑塘泥，因为要走近路，竟任意地踩死了单干农民田里的油菜；他们为着修好社内的田塍，还挖走了互助组员的田塍上的大石头。有些农业生产合作社因为同互助组、单干农民争夺肥料，不断地发生吵嘴、打架的事情。有些社员看见了单干农民，讥讽地捏着鼻子说：“快走，快走，‘单干臭’来了！”不少社员摆老资格，说“互助组是落脚货，没什么搞头”。这样一来，互助组和单干农民很不满意农业生产合作社，说“农业生产合作社当了王”，“只有社员好，我们都不好”，对农业生产合作社抱着对立情绪。
    这种情况虽然不是普遍的，却是十分严重的，应该引起大家的注意，决不能让它发展下去。如果听任这种情况发展下去，就会影响农业互助合作运动的开展，就会妨害春耕工作的进行。
    这种情况的发生，说明某些地区在建立农业生产合作社的工作中，没有全面地掌握和贯彻党的政策，没有把办社工作当作引导全体农民前进的动力。这样自然谈不到从思想上去教育农业生产合作社的社员，使他们很好地去团结互助组和单干农民。因此，上面所说的那些错误现象，也就难于避免了。
    为了纠正某些农业生产合作社对互助组和单干农民那种错误态度和错误行为，这些地区的领导机关，必须全面地贯彻党的政策，加强对农业生产合作社社员的社会主义教育。要让每个社员懂得社会主义的原则是先进的帮助落后的，大的帮助小的，强的帮助弱的，而决不是先进的欺侮落后的，大的欺侮小的，强的欺侮弱的。农业生产合作社既然是走社会主义道路的先进旗帜，就应该以社会主义精神来对待社外农民，就应该热情地关心和帮助社外农民，引导他们共同前进。要让每一个农业生产合作社的社员都懂得：歧视和讥笑社外农民是十分错误的，是和先进的帮助落后的社会主义的原则不相容的。只有团结好社外农民，共同把生产搞好，才能巩固和发展农业生产合作社，实现农业社会主义改造。
