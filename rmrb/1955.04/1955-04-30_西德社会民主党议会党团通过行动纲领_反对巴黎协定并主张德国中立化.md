Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 27th (TASS dispatch): Hamburg Radio and various news agencies reported on the meeting of the West German Federal Assembly's Social Democratic Party parliamentary group. It can be seen from the reports that this meeting adopted an action program to strengthen the struggle against the Paris Accords, which mentions:

	I. The Chairman of the German Social Democratic Party, Ollenhauer, should write a letter to Adenauer warning that the Paris Accords would block the road to German reunification. II. The leadership of the German Social Democratic Party should establish contact with the Free Democratic Party and the Refugee Party, which participate in the Bonn coalition government, because representatives of these two parties have proposed that Germany should join a neutral group of countries that is neither linked to the West nor to the East. III. The German Social Democratic Party should strive to re-discuss the Paris Accords in the Federal Assembly.

According to Hamburg Radio, Ollenhauer said at the meeting that it would be wrong to think that the Soviet Union would still agree to negotiate on the issue of German reunification after the Paris Accords came into effect.

    西德社会民主党议会党团通过行动纲领
    反对巴黎协定并主张德国中立化
    新华社二十九日讯　据塔斯社柏林二十七日讯：汉堡电台和各通讯社报道了西德联邦议院的德国社会民主党议会党团举行会议的消息。从消息中可以看出，这次会议通过了一个为反对巴黎协定而加强斗争的行动纲领，其中提到：
    一、由德国社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔写信警告阿登纳：巴黎协定会堵塞重新统一德国的道路；二、德国社会民主党的领导方面应该同参加了波恩联合政府的自由民主党和难民党建立接触，因为这两个党的代表提出了德国应该加入一个既不同西方联结，也不同东方联结的中立国家集团的主张；三、德国社会民主党应当争取在联邦议院中重新讨论巴黎协定问题。
    据汉堡电台广播，奥伦豪尔在这次会议上说，如果认为苏联在巴黎协定生效以后还会同意就恢复德国统一问题进行谈判，那就不对了。
