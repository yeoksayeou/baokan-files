    On the Eve of the Asian-African Conference
    By our reporter Wu Wentao

    The beautiful Bandung is making its final preparations, it is the eve of the Asian-African Conference.

    For the past few days, land and air traffic between Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, and Bandung, the capital of West Java, has been unusually busy. So far, the majority of the delegations and many observers have arrived. There are already more than four hundred registered foreign and local journalists.

    Bandung on the 16th was drizzled with intermittent rain. Because it was rumored that the delegations from India, Burma, Egypt, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the People's Republic of China were arriving that day, the roadsides from the airport to the city were crowded with welcoming crowds all day long. Only Prime Minister Nehru, Prime Minister U Nu, and Prime Minister Nasser arrived that evening amidst the cheers of the crowd. Thus, early in the morning of the 17th, the masses gathered again spontaneously. Many older people simply brought a chair with them so they could wait for a long time. Around ten o'clock, the Vietnamese and Chinese delegations arrived in Bandung one after another. When Premier Zhou left the airport accompanied by the Indonesian Prime Minister, the crowd cheered, and the enthusiasm was exceptional. In front of the residence of the Chinese delegation on Dago Street, the crowds standing and waving did not disperse for a long time.

    Indeed, the people of Indonesia, as the host, are welcoming this historic event with unparalleled excitement. Especially Bandung, this scenic mountain city with 600,000 residents, seems particularly busy and tense; every citizen seems to be honored that this mountain city is the venue for the Asian-African Conference.

    The venue prepared by the Bandung authorities and people for the conference is the former Dutch club - the Concordia Building, which has now been acquired by the Indonesian government. After a major renovation, this snow-white building has been renamed "Independence Building" at the suggestion of President Sukarno, and the "East Street" in front of it has also been renamed "Asia-Africa Street." Here, the flags of the twenty-nine participating countries are raised high, which looks quite beautiful and magnificent from a distance. Inside the venue, the seats of the conference chairman - the five inviting countries - are set on a platform with a deep red curtain and national flags as the background, followed by the seats of the Indonesian President and Vice President and their wives, the diplomatic corps, and the participating countries. The entire arrangement is very simple and elegant.

    In recent days, newspapers and radio stations have been constantly calling on citizens to pay attention to the appearance of the city; especially after the incident of American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents plotting to murder members of our delegation and journalists, it has further aroused the citizens' attention to maintaining public order. The Indonesian News Agency editorial on the 15th stated: "Hosting the Asian-African Conference is a test of Indonesia's ability to conduct international affairs and its awareness of national sovereignty. Hosting the Asian-African Conference is a matter of national honor, so not only the government and officials, but the entire society should participate in defending public order."

    As Premier Zhou said in his speech at Bandung Airport, "Some people do not like this conference of ours, and they are trying to undermine our conference." For example, some Western journalists who came to Bandung are spreading pessimistic air and asking questions like this everywhere: "The participating countries have various different systems, how can this conference be successful?"

    In an editorial entitled "A Historic Meeting," the Jakarta "Independent" newspaper on the 16th strongly condemned this argument. The newspaper said: "For centuries, Asia has been treated as a milch cow by Western countries. After some Asian countries gained independence, Western countries instigated discord among them. The attending countries of the Asian-African Conference must be vigilant about this." The newspaper believes: "The twenty-nine countries that will gather in Bandung represent more than half of the world's population. If these countries cooperate because of common interests and destiny, they can achieve the goal of truly maintaining world peace." The newspaper concluded: "In any case, this conference will become a new page in the relations between the Asian and African nations."

    On April 16th, the Indonesian Foreign Minister Sunario stayed at Jakarta Airport all day to receive foreign guests. When someone asked him about the prospects of the Asian-African Conference, he believed that the convening of the conference would at least help realize the ideal of easing international tensions and consolidating world peace. He rebuked the remarks spread by some saboteurs that the Asian-African Conference was an anti-Western conference, and he explained that what Asian and African countries opposed was Western colonialism. …

    Tomorrow, the Asian-African Conference will officially open. It is reported that in addition to the opening and closing plenary sessions, the middle sessions will be group meetings. It is no exaggeration to say that the Indonesian people are making the greatest efforts to assist in the convening of the Asian-African Conference. As such, the people here are very welcoming of Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at Bandung Airport, believing that it has given people new encouragement and confidence to overcome various disruptions and obstacles, so that the Asian-African Conference can make valuable contributions to promoting friendship and cooperation between Asian and African countries and to maintaining peace in the Asian-African region and the world.

    April 17th in Bandung

### 在亚非会议的前夕

    在亚非会议的前夕
    本报记者　吴文焘
    秀丽的万隆正在进行着最后的准备，这是亚非会议的前夕了。
    几天来，从印度尼西亚京城雅加达到西爪哇首府万隆间的陆空交通异常繁忙。到目前为止，绝大部分的代表团和不少的观察员已经到来了。备案的外国和当地记者已有四百余名。
    十六日的万隆不时落着急雨。因为听说那天印度、缅甸、埃及、越南民主共和国和中华人民共和国的代表团要来了，从机场到市区的马路两旁，整天都拥挤着欢迎的人群。当晚在万众欢腾中莅临的只有尼赫鲁总理、吴努总理和纳赛尔总理，这样十七日的大清早，群众又自动集拢来了。很多年长的人索性带了一把椅子，以便能够长久等候。十时许越中两国代表团先后到达万隆。当周总理在印度尼西亚总理陪同下离开机场时，群众欢呼，热烈异常。在达门萨里街中国代表团寓所的门前，伫立招手的人群更是经久不散。
    的确，作为东道主的印度尼西亚人民，是以无比兴奋的心情来迎接这个有历史意义的盛会的。特别是这有着六十万居民、风景明媚的万隆，更显得格外忙碌紧张；每个市民都似乎以这个山城作为亚非会议的会址而感到光荣。
    万隆当局和人民给大会准备的会场，是以前荷兰人的俱乐部——岗果利亚大厦，今为印度尼西亚政府所收买。经过大力修葺后，这所雪白色建筑，已在苏加诺总统的提议下改名为“独立大厦”，前面的一条“东大街”，也改名为“亚非大街”。这里人们高高地竖起了二十九个与会国的国旗，远远望去，颇觉绮丽壮观。在会场里，大会主席——五个邀请国的座位设在以深红布幔和国旗为背景的台上，接着是印度尼西亚正副总统和夫人、外交团以及各与会国的席位，整个布置都很朴素雅致。
    连日以来，报纸和广播不断号召市民注意市容；特别在美蒋特务谋杀我代表团人员和新闻工作者的事件发生后，更唤起市民对于维护公共治安的注意。十五日的印度尼西亚新闻报社论就说：“亚非会议的主持工作，是对印度尼西亚在国际交往事务中的活动能力以及对国家主权的觉悟程度的考验。亚非会议的主持工作，是国家民族的荣誉问题，因之不仅政府和官方，社会全体都应该参加来保卫治安。”
    正像周总理在万隆机场谈话中所说的，“有些人是不喜欢我们这个会议的，他们正在力图破坏我们的会议。”例如，一些来到万隆的西方记者，他们散布悲观空气，到处提出这类的问题：“与会国有着各种不同的制度，这个会怎样能够开好呢？”
    在题为“有历史意义的会议”的社论中，十六日的雅加达“独立”报，痛斥了这种论调。该报说：“几世纪以来，亚洲一直被西方国家当作乳牛。而在一些亚洲国家取得独立之后，西方国家就在它们之间进行挑拨离间。这一点，亚非会议的出席国家是必须警觉的。”该报认为：“将在万隆聚首的二十九个国家，代表全世界人类的一半以上。如果这些国家由于共同的利益和命运而合作的话，是能够达到真正维护世界和平的目标的。”该报最后说：“无论如何，这个会议将成为亚非各民族间关系的新的一页。”
    四月十六日这一天，印度尼西亚的外长苏纳约为了接待国外的来宾，终日守候在雅加达飞机场。有人请他谈谈亚非会议的前景时，他认为会议的召开至少是有助于实现缓和国际紧张局势、巩固世界和平的理想的。他斥责一些居心破坏者所散布的亚非会议是反对西方的会议的言论，他说明亚洲和非洲国家所反对的是西方的殖民主义。……
    明天，亚非会议就要正式开幕了。据悉除了首尾的全体大会外，中间都将是小组会议。可以毫不夸张地说，印度尼西亚人民正以最大的努力来协助亚非会议的召开的。就是这样，这里的人们十分欢迎周恩来总理在万隆机场的谈话，认为它给了人们以新的鼓舞和信心，来克服各种破坏和阻挠，使亚非会议对于促进亚非国家之间的友好和合作，对于维护亚非地区和世界的和平，作出有价值的贡献。
    四月十七日于万隆
