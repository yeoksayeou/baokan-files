	Key Project of Baoji-Lueyang Section of Baocheng Railway Begins Construction
	Auxiliary projects in the Baoji-Lueyang section of the Baocheng Railway are nearing completion, and key main-line projects are successively starting construction.
	Among the auxiliary projects, the parallel highway from Lianghekou to Huangshahe has been completed for 50 kilometers, and the access highway from Huixian to Huangshahe was completed on March 12. Most of the access lines and major bridges at various construction sites that have started work have been completed by the end of March. Key main-line projects, such as the earth and stone excavation outside of Tunnels No. 1, 7, 12, 20, and 27, the earth and stone excavation at kilometers 123 to 125, the Zhan'erxiang station yard which requires leveling two large mountains, and the Xipo station yard which has the largest amount of excavation and filling, are under intense construction. Among them, the open cut excavation project outside Tunnel No. 20, the second longest tunnel on the Baocheng Railway, has cleared three serious collapses and is now transporting small steel rails, dump trucks, and installing machinery in preparation for entering the tunnel for construction. The guide tunnels for other tunnels will also be excavated in early April.
	The Second Engineering Office of the Fourth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways is vigorously carrying out various preparatory works to create conditions for a full-scale start in the second quarter.
