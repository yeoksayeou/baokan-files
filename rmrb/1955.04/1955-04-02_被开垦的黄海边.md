The Yellow Sea coast, stretching for thousands of miles from the mouth of the Yangtze River to the foot of Yuntai Mountain, the terminus of the Longhai Railway, is now completely different from what it used to be. More than 2.5 million mu of saline-alkali wasteland has been reclaimed into fertile farmland, and cotton fields have increased from 2.5 million mu before liberation to more than 5 million mu. There are now more than a dozen state-owned farms such as Dongxin and Huaihai. These farms own nearly 200 tractors and combine harvesters. The more than 1.5 million mu of land reclaimed by the state-owned farms are all planned for mechanized farming. Each piece of land is surrounded by wide and flat roads, accessible to large trucks and tractors, and has a systematic drainage and irrigation canal system capable of navigating inland river steamers or agricultural vessels. Poplar trees, locust trees, and various shrubs are planted along the roads and canals, forming a farmland shelterbelt network. Neat new villages have been built at the intersections of roads, canals, and shelterbelts. Thousands of houses have been built in these new villages, including offices, mechanical warehouses, grain warehouses, work stations, livestock farms, laboratories, meteorological stations, power plants, mechanical repair shops, iron and wood factories, cotton ginning and oil pressing plants, as well as employee dormitories, hospitals, libraries, employee schools, canteens, clubs, bathhouses, etc. In 1954, these farms produced nearly 10 million jin of commodity grain and 3 million jin of cotton for the state. In 1955, these farms are continuing to reclaim wasteland and will further improve land utilization to produce more grain and cotton for the state.

Many agricultural producers' cooperatives have also emerged on the coast. The Kangzhuang Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Binhai County has more than 270 member households and has reclaimed nearly 20,000 mu of wasteland. In 1954, the income of members increased five to tenfold compared to 1952. In the past, these members lived in caves dug on riverbanks, making a living by cutting firewood from the wasteland; now they have built a neat village along the canal, which includes the cooperative's offices, warehouses, clinics, clubs, and a sales and supply cooperative's retail department.

In addition, there are also orchards on the coast, producing sweet pears, honey peaches, apples, grapes, apricots, plums, and other fruits. The famous Hongmen Orchard produces more than 600,000 jin of various fruits annually.

Xinhua News Agency—On the Yellow Sea coast of Jiangsu Province, including all or part of more than a dozen counties and cities such as Xin Hailian City, Sheyang, and Qidong, the soil contains salt, and most of it used to be reeds and weeds. After liberation, the People's Government led the people to build high sea dikes and many sluice gates to block the roaring tides; they also dug many irrigation canals to use fresh water to leach the saline-alkali soil. Since then, large quantities of cotton and grain crops have been planted on this land, and new villages have appeared one after another.

    被开垦的黄海边
    从长江口起到陇海铁路的终点云台山麓，南北长达千里的黄海边上，现在和过去完全两样了。二百五十多万亩盐碱荒地已被开垦成良田，棉田已由解放前的二百五十万亩增加到五百多万亩。现在这里有东辛、淮海等国营农场十多个。这些农场拥有拖拉机和联合收割机近二百台。国营农场开垦的一百五十多万亩土地都是按机器耕作规划的。每块土地四周都有宽阔平坦的马路，可以通行大型汽车和拖拉机；有系统的排水灌溉河渠，能够航行内河轮船或农用船只。沿着马路和渠道种植着杨树、槐树等树木和各种灌木，构成农田防护林网。在马路、渠道和防护林交叉点上，建筑了整齐的新村。这些新村里建起了数千幢房屋，有办公室、机械仓库、粮食仓库、工作站、畜牧场、试验室、气象台、发电厂、机械修理厂、铁木工厂、轧花榨油厂，还有职工宿舍、医院、图书室、职工学校、食堂、俱乐部、浴室等。一九五四年这些农场为国家生产商品粮食近一千万斤，棉花三百万斤。一九五五年这些农场还在继续开荒，并将进一步提高土地利用率，为国家生产更多的粮食和棉花。
    海边上还出现了许多农业生产合作社。滨海县康庄农业生产合作社有社员二百七十多户，已开垦荒地近两万亩。一九五四年社员收入比一九五二年增加五倍到十倍。过去这些社员都是在河坎上挖洞居住，靠割荒地上的柴草生活的；现在他们沿着渠道建成了一个整齐的村庄，其中有合作社的办公室，仓库、门诊室、俱乐部，还有供销合作社的门市部。
    此外，海边上还有果园，出产甜梨、蜜桃、苹果、葡萄、杏子、李子等水果。有名的鸿门果园，年产各种水果六十多万斤。
    在江苏省黄海边上，包括新海连市、射阳、启东等十多个县市的全部或部分地区。这里土壤含有盐份，过去大都是一片芦苇和野草。解放以后，人民政府领导人民在这里建筑起高大的海堤和许多闸坝，把咆哮的海潮挡住；又开挖了许多灌溉渠道，以便用淡水来淋洗盐碱土。从此，这块土地上大量地种上了棉花和粮食作物，新的村庄也相继出现了。（新华社）
