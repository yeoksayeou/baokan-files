Hebei Plans to Promote High-Yield Crops Such as Corn

    Hebei Province initially plans to plant 2.8 million mu of high-yield crops such as corn, potatoes, and rice this year, which is estimated to increase grain production by 300 million jin.
    After the plan for planting high-yield grain crops in Hebei Province was specifically studied by various special districts and counties in light of local conditions, and the benefits of changing to high-yield crops according to local conditions were publicized to farmers, it was supported by the farmers. Tangshan, Baoding, and Tongxian special districts, which used to grow more low-yield crops such as sorghum, millet, and beans, have decided to expand the planting of high-yield crops such as corn and sweet potatoes by more than 1.7 million mu this year. Agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers in various counties of Tangshan Special District are revising their planting plans. The Qiu Jiaying First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Changli County originally planned to plant 100 mu of corn, but now it has decided to change 300 mu of sorghum to corn. Twenty-three agricultural production cooperatives in the Fifth District of Qian'an County have decided to expand the corn planting area to more than 1,000 mu, an increase of 46 percent over last year. All 958 agricultural production cooperatives in Tongxian County have formulated plans to expand the planting area of high-yield crops.
    In the main cotton-producing areas of Handan, Xingtai, and Shijiazhuang special districts, farmers are also determined to appropriately increase the planting area of sweet potatoes and corn while ensuring the completion of the state cotton planting plan, so as to ensure that the grain output after the expansion of cotton fields is not less than last year.

    河北计划推广玉米等高产作物
    河北省今年初步计划种植玉米、薯类、水稻等高产作物二百八十万亩，估计可增产粮食三亿斤。
    河北省种植高产粮食作物的计划，经过各专区、县结合当地条件加以具体研究，并向农民宣传因地制宜改种高产作物的好处后，受到了农民的拥护。过去种高粱、谷子、豆子等低产作物较多的唐山、保定、通县等专区，今年决定扩大玉米、甘薯等高产作物一百七十多万亩。唐山专区各县农业生产合作社，互助组和单干农民正纷纷修订种植计划。昌黎县邱家营第一农业生产合作社原计划种一百亩玉米，现在决定把三百亩高粱改种成玉米。迁安县第五区二十三个农业生产合作社决定把玉米的种植面积扩大到一千多亩，比去年扩大百分之四十六。通县九百五十八个农业生产合作社都已订出扩大高产作物种植面积的计划。
    在主要产棉区邯郸、邢台、石家庄等专区，农民也决心在保证完成国家植棉计划的情况下，适当增加甘薯、玉米的种植面积，以保证棉田扩大后粮食产量不比去年减少。　（新华社）
