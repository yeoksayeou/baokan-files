Shao Lizi, Huang Shaohong, Weng Wenhao, and Wei Lihuang, among others, issued statements on April 16 regarding the murder of Shi Zhiang and other staff members of our delegation to the Asian-African Conference, along with journalists Shen Jiantu and others, totaling eleven individuals, by U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents.

Shao Lizi said: I am deeply saddened by the news of the deaths of my delegation's staff members and Chinese and foreign journalists. I am extremely angry at the U.S. aggressive bloc's hostility towards our country, its commission of the most despicable assassination crimes, and its dissemination of shameless denials and malicious slanders. I believe that this feeling of sorrow and anger is shared by all peace-loving people around the world, who will unanimously condemn such political conspiracies that undermine peace. In order to mourn the martyrs who sacrificed for the cause of peace, and in order to eliminate the threats to the cause of peace, I believe that our people will transform grief and anger into strength, resolutely struggle against the U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Asian-African Conference, and jointly strive to liberate Taiwan and completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

Huang Shaohong said: I fully endorse the statement of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the sabotage of the plane carrying staff members of our delegation to the Asian-African Conference by U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents. I, along with the people of the whole country and the peace-loving people of the world, express unparalleled indignation at the despicable act of assassination by U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, aimed at sabotaging the Asian-African Conference. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Hong Kong has become a major base for U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, openly organizing and carrying out sabotage activities and murdering progressive individuals, which is a well-known fact to the world. The Asian-African Conference is what U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang openly want to sabotage; murdering members of the Chinese delegation is one of their means of sabotage. No matter how they try to cover up or quibble, they cannot wash away their crimes. This incident once again exposes the ugly faces of U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and once again strengthens our vigilance in the struggle for peace.

Weng Wenhao said: U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents murdered members of our delegation to the Asian-African Conference, causing the plane to crash mid-air, resulting in the deaths of all staff members and journalists. This incident fully demonstrates how deliberately U.S. imperialism is trying to sabotage the Asian-African Conference representing 1.44 billion people. The U.S. aggressive bloc is fearful of the Asian-African Conference, so they are carrying out sabotage to obstruct the success of the conference. Their use of conspiracy and assassination is truly mad and challenges all of humanity. We Chinese people are particularly angered that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is willing to be enslaved by U.S. imperialism and commit shameless acts despised by the people of the world. We can only be more resentful and more determined to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

Wei Lihuang said: Due to the premeditated sabotage by U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents in Hong Kong, eleven staff members of our delegation and Chinese and foreign journalists traveling on an Indian plane to attend the Asian-African Conference unfortunately perished. All upright people in the world are extremely indignant at this despicable act by the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek. For many years, Hong Kong has been a breeding ground for the activities of U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, which is a fact known to Chinese and foreign people in Hong Kong. The plane crash was undoubtedly the result of a conspiracy plotted by U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents.

This incident further proves that the U.S. occupation of Taiwan and its protection of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is the root cause of endangering the peace and security of the Chinese people. While mourning the dead martyrs, the Chinese people will be even more united and vow to fight for the liberation of Taiwan and the elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

    邵力子、黄绍竑、翁文灏和卫立煌发表谈话
    斥责美蒋特务的谋杀罪行
    本报讯　邵力子、黄绍竑、翁文灏和卫立煌等，在四月十六日为我国参加亚非会议的代表团工作人员石志昂等和记者沈建图等十一人被美蒋特务谋杀事件发表谈话。
    邵力子说：我对于我代表团工作人员和中外记者全部遇难的消息，万分悲痛。我对于美国侵略集团的敌视我国，甘犯最卑鄙的暗杀罪行，并且散布无耻抵赖和恶意诬蔑的论调，万分愤怒。我相信这种悲痛和愤怒的心情，是全世界爱好和平的人民所同具，他们将一致谴责那种破坏和平的政治阴谋。为了悼念为和平事业牺牲的烈士，为了消除对于和平事业的威胁，我相信我国人民必将化悲痛、愤怒为力量，为反对美国帝国主义的破坏亚非会议而坚决斗争，为解放台湾、彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团而共同努力。
    黄绍竑说：我完全拥护我国外交部关于我出席亚非会议代表团工作人员座机因美蒋特务破坏失事的声明。我对于美帝国主义和蒋匪帮以破坏亚非会议为目的的暗杀卑鄙行为与全国人民一样与世界爱好和平的人民一样，表示无比的愤慨。一九四九年中华人民共和国成立以来，香港就成为美蒋特务的大本营，公开组织、进行破坏活动和杀害进步人士，是举世皆知的事实。亚非会议是美帝国主义和蒋匪帮公然想要破坏的；谋杀中国代表团人员，是它们破坏的一种手段。尽管它们怎样掩饰、狡辩，都无法洗刷它们的罪行。这一事件又一次揭露了美帝国主义和蒋匪帮丑恶的面貌，又一次加强了我们在争取和平的斗争中的警惕性。
    翁文灏说：美蒋特务谋杀我国参加亚非会议代表团人员，使飞机中途失事，工作人员和记者们全部殉难。这个事件充分表明美帝国主义是如何蓄意破坏代表十四亿四千万人民的亚非会议。美国侵略集团对亚非会议心怀惧怕，所以进行破坏，以阻挠会议的成功。他们使用阴谋暗杀手段，真是丧心病狂，向全人类挑战。我们中国人民特感愤怒的是蒋介石卖国集团甘受美帝国主义奴役，做出全世界人民所鄙视的无耻行为。我们只有更为愤恨，更为加强解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团的决心。
    卫立煌说：由于香港美蒋特务的预谋破坏，乘坐印度飞机参加亚非会议的我国代表团工作人员和中外记者十一人，不幸全部罹难。世界一切正直人士，对于美蒋这一卑鄙行径，无不万分愤慨。多年以来，香港即成为美蒋特务活动的渊薮，这是香港中外人士所共知的事实。这次飞机失事的事件，无疑是美蒋特务阴谋策划的结果。
    这次事件更加证明，美国霸占台湾，庇护蒋介石卖国集团，这是危害中国人民和平与安全的祸根。中国人民在悼念死难烈士的时候，将更加万众一心，誓为解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团而奋斗。
