Fujian's Mulan Creek Banks Expand Sugarcane Planting

Farmers in Xianyou County, Fujian Province, the famous sugarcane producing area along the Mulan Creek, are expanding their sugarcane planting area. At the end of March, groups of women in villages along the Mulan Creek sat in front of their homes carefully selecting sugarcane seeds. Some farmers shouted at the oxen to quickly plow and till the fields, while others were planting sugarcane in the fields. The early-planted sugarcane has already sprouted tender green shoots. Xianyou County plans to plant more than 78,000 mu of sugarcane this year, which is 36,000 mu more than the year with the most sugarcane planting before the War of Resistance Against Japan.

This year, many areas are promoting the new cold-resistant and drought-resistant sugarcane variety "Taisugar 134," and improving planting techniques at the same time. In Xitou Township, the Sixth District, 80% of the more than 700 mu of sugarcane fields have adopted intensive planting methods.

Due to the improvement of planting techniques and increased fertilizer application, the yield per unit area of sugarcane fields this year will be higher than last year. If there are no unexpected disasters, more than 610,000 dan of cane sugar will be produced on both sides of the Mulan Creek this year, an increase of more than 160,000 dan compared to last year.

    福建木兰溪两岸扩种甘蔗
    福建省著名的蔗糖产地——仙游县木兰溪两岸的农民扩大甘蔗种植面积。三月底，木兰溪两岸的乡村里，一群群妇女坐在家门前仔细地选蔗种，农民们有的吆喝着耕牛赶紧翻土犁田，有的在田里栽种甘蔗；早种下的甘蔗，已经长出了嫩绿的幼芽。仙游县今年计划种植七万八千多亩甘蔗，比抗日战争前种蔗最多的一年还要多三万六千亩。
    今年许多地区推广了耐寒耐旱的新蔗种——“台糖一三四”，同时改进了种植技术。第六区溪头乡七百多亩蔗田百分之八十采用了密植方法。
    由于改进种植技术，多下肥料，今年蔗田的单位面积产量将比去年提高。如无意外灾害，今年木兰溪两岸将出产蔗糖六十一万多担，比去年增产十六万多担。
