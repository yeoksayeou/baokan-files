Xinhua News Agency, April 27th: The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League held its Third National Conference on Work for Children in Beijing from March 3rd to 11th. The conference was attended by 121 people, including cadres in charge of children's work from the Youth League organizations of various provinces and cities, outstanding Young Pioneer instructors from various regions, and leading cadres from children's newspapers and magazines.

The conference focused on discussing the issue of actively developing the Young Pioneer organization.

The conference believes that children's work nationwide has been successful over the past year, with the number of Young Pioneers reaching ten million. The Young Pioneer organization has played a positive role in supporting school education, enriching children's lives, developing their intellectual and physical abilities, and cultivating new moral qualities. It is loved by the vast majority of children and praised by schools, families, and all sectors of society. However, the development of the Young Pioneer organization has been too slow, failing to meet the needs of children and adapt to the task of cultivating new socialist individuals for the motherland. Currently, the ten million Young Pioneers nationwide account for only 13% of children of appropriate age and 26% of middle and primary school students of appropriate age. Many children eager to join the Young Pioneers have been kept outside the organization for a long time. This not only violates the provisions of the Young Pioneer Charter regarding the nature and tasks of the organization but also damages the initiative and ambition of children. The conference criticized the erroneous view that the Young Pioneers are an organization for a small number of "advanced" children, criticized the incorrect approach of pitting the development work of the Young Pioneers against educational work, believing that "consolidation must be done well before development." In particular, it seriously criticized the outdated educational view that only children who are "gentle, well-behaved, honest, and obedient" can join the organization.

The conference pointed out that the Young Pioneers is a broad-based organization for children, which inspires and cultivates children's initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity through various rich and educational activities. It sets the goal for children to strive for the realization of communism and the great cause of the motherland, encouraging them to study, live, and work more consciously. Therefore, the larger the Young Pioneer organization develops, the more children it attracts, and the greater its role will be. The conference unanimously agreed that the Young Pioneer organization must adopt a policy of active and large-scale development in the future. The development work of the Young Pioneers must be closely integrated with educational work. It is necessary to conduct good publicity and education work on the Young Pioneer organization before and after admitting children, helping children understand what kind of organization the Young Pioneers is and the meaning of the various symbols of the organization. At the same time, Youth League committees at all levels must not let the development work go unchecked and must proceed in accordance with the principles of leadership and planning. In order to do a good job in organizational development and educational work, the conference emphasized that Youth League committees at all levels must select and appoint outstanding teachers or Youth League members who are ideologically progressive, have a correct work style, and love children to serve as instructors, and provide them with training in the basic knowledge of Young Pioneer work. Seriously doing the work of selecting and training instructors is the main key to accelerating the development of the Young Pioneer work and developing the Young Pioneer organization on a large scale.

The conference also discussed how to further develop the activities of the Young Pioneers and strengthen their education. The conference believes that the extracurricular life of children is currently too monotonous and impoverished. The life of the Young Pioneers should be made richer and more active, and children should be led to be more lively and brave. To this end, children's workers, instructors, and teachers must comprehensively care for children's lives, inspire and guide them to carry out a variety of activities according to their interests and hobbies, and give full play to their initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity. At the same time, Youth League committees at all levels should also make full use of and appropriately establish children's extracurricular education institutions and activity venues such as children's palaces, children's homes, and children's libraries to enrich and enliven the life of the Young Pioneers.

The conference emphasized that Youth League organizations at all levels must strengthen their leadership over the work of the Young Pioneers, and any thought that belittles the work of children is wrong. Children are the new force of the motherland, and the Young Pioneers are the reserve force of the Youth League. Youth League cadres should regard caring for and helping the work of the Young Pioneers as their own responsibility. The Youth League organization should educate all Youth League members to regard caring for and loving children as a communist virtue they should possess.

### 中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会  召开全国少年儿童工作会议

    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会
    召开全国少年儿童工作会议
    新华社二十七日讯　中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会三月三日到十一日在北京举行第三次全国少年儿童工作会议。参加这次会议的有青年团各省市组织的少年儿童工作干部，各地少年先锋队的优秀辅导员以及儿童报刊、杂志的负责干部等一百二十一人。
    这次会议着重讨论了积极发展少年先锋队组织的问题。
    会议认为一年多来，全国的少年儿童工作是有成绩的，少年先锋队员已发展到一千万名。少年先锋队组织在配合学校教育，丰富儿童生活，发展儿童的智力和体力，培养儿童新的道德品质等方面，起了良好的作用，它受到广大少年儿童的热爱，并受到学校、家庭和社会各方面的赞许。但是，少年先锋队组织的发展过于缓慢，不能满足少年儿童的要求，也不能适应为祖国培养社会主义新人的任务。目前全国一千万少年先锋队员只占全国适合队龄儿童的百分之十三，占中、小学适合队龄儿童的百分之二十六。各地有许多渴望入队的少年儿童长期被关在少年先锋队组织的门外，这样就不但违反了少年先锋队队章关于队的性质和任务的规定，而且损害了儿童的积极性和上进心。会议批判了那种认为少年先锋队是少数“先进”儿童组织的错误看法，批判了把少先队的发展工作和教育工作对立起来、认为“巩固好了才能发展”的不正确做法，特别对于那种认为“斯文规矩，老实听话”的孩子才能入队的陈旧的教育观点，给予了认真的批判。
    会议指出，少年先锋队是一个广泛性的少年儿童组织，它以各种丰富而富有教育意义的活动启发和培养儿童的主动性、积极性和创造性，它为儿童们提出了为实现共产主义和祖国的伟大事业而奋斗的目标，鼓舞儿童更加自觉地学习、生活和工作，因此，少年先锋队组织发展得愈大，它所吸引的儿童愈多，它的作用也就愈大。会议一致认为，少年先锋队组织今后必须采取积极大量发展的方针。少先队的发展工作一定要和教育工作密切结合起来，在吸收儿童入队的前后必须很好地进行关于少先队组织的宣传教育工作，帮助儿童了解少先队是什么样的组织和队的各种标志的意义。同时各级团委对发展工作不能放任自流，必须按照有领导、有计划的原则进行。为了做好组织发展和教育工作，会议着重指出：各级团委必须选聘思想进步、作风正派、热爱儿童的优秀教师或团员担任辅导员，并给以少先队工作的基本知识的训练。认真地做好选聘和训练辅导员的工作，是加速开展少先队的工作、大量发展少先队组织的主要关键。
    会议还讨论了如何进一步开展少年先锋队的活动和加强少年先锋队的教育问题。会议认为目前少年儿童的课余生活太枯燥，太贫乏，应该使少先队的生活更加丰富和活跃起来，应该把少年儿童带领的更加活泼、勇敢一些。为此，少年儿童工作者、辅导员和教师们必须全面关心儿童的生活，启发和引导他们根据自己的兴趣和爱好开展多种多样的活动，发挥他们的主动性、积极性和创造性。同时各地团委还应该充分运用和适当建立少年宫、少年之家、儿童图书馆等儿童校外教育机关和活动场所，以丰富和活跃少先队的生活。
    会议强调提出，青年团各级组织必须加强对少年先锋队工作的领导，任何轻视少年儿童工作的思想都是错误的。少年儿童是祖国的新生力量，少先队是青年团的后备军，青年团的干部都应该把关心和帮助少先队的工作当作自己的责任。团的组织应该教育全体青年团员以关心和热爱儿童作为自己应当具有的共产主义美德。
