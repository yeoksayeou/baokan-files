Gaiping County Utilizes Barren Hillsides to Cultivate Apple Trees

Liaoning Province's Gaiping County farmers plan to plant two million apple trees on barren hills this year. The eastern and southeastern parts of Gaiping County are mountainous and suitable for planting apple trees. Thanks to the vigorous support of the People's Government, the county now has three million apple trees, with an annual output of over 100 million jin, which is a very important source of income for the county's farmers. In order to fully utilize these mountains and solve the employment problem for more than 50,000 surplus laborers in the county, it has been decided to plant a large number of apple trees this year. At present, farmers are carrying out tree planting preparations such as digging tree pits.

    盖平县利用荒山栽培苹果树
    辽宁省盖平县农民计划今年利用荒山种植苹果树二百万棵。盖平县的东部和东南部是山地，适宜栽植苹果树，由于人民政府的大力扶持，全县现已有三百万棵苹果树，年产量达一亿斤以上，是该县农民很重要的一项收入，为了充分利用这些山地，并解决全县五万多名剩余劳力的出路问题，决定今年大量种植苹果树。目前农民正在进行刨树坑等植树准备工作。　（刘延之）
