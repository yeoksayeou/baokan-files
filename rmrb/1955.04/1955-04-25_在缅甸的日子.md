Days in Burma
Deputy Head of the People’s Republic of China Cultural Delegation to Burma, Zhou Erfu

On the morning of February 4, 1955, we walked from the Strand Hotel in Yangon to the Louis Road Pier across the street and boarded the "Mintami" ship. This was a yacht, with countless small flags of China and Burma hanging from the ceiling, interspersed with red, green and colorful flowers and balloons.

We sat mixed with our Burmese friends, watching the Strand Hotel recede into the distance, and the golden Shwedagon Pagoda, towering among the green shade, also recede. The "Mintami" quietly sailed on the beautiful Irrawaddy River.

On the purple carpet, female students from the Burmese Normal School performed the "Burmese Rice Planting Dance" and the "Burmese Long Drum Dance"; the famous singer Du Meidan of the Burmese Broadcasting Station, the famous film actress Zhen Zhenmu, and the musician Sheng Bazhi sang ancient and modern Burmese songs for us.

After the performances, Chinese and Burmese friends from the literary and art circles sat at small square tables and talked intimately. Language could not hinder our friendship. Peking opera actress Huang Yuhua was talking with the famous Burmese actress Zhen Zhenmu using gestures and expressions. She was also learning Burmese from Zhen Zhenmu. She opened her notebook, recorded notes, and chatted. Zhen Zhenmu interspersed a word or two of Chinese in her Burmese, and Huang Yuhua also added a word or two of Burmese she had just learned in her Chinese.

At another table, contralto Dong Ailin was learning Burmese songs from the famous Burmese singer Du Meidan, singing and talking. Behind Dong Ailin, several young Chinese dancers were surrounding a middle-aged Burmese dancer, studying the similarities and differences between Chinese and Burmese dance. U Hla Maung, the Burmese Ambassador to our country, sat with us near the ship's railing, discussing Chinese and Burmese customs and habits...

"Mintami" was a ship of friendship, sailing on the peaceful Irrawaddy River. We engaged in cultural exchange to our heart's content. This pleasant voyage left me with a deep impression.

Similarly, a grand gathering on the lawn next to the Burmese Federal Club on the shore of Green Lake in Yangon is also unforgettable for me. This was at 10:30 am on February 1st. The Burmese Writers Association and the Artists Association jointly held a grand reception to welcome us. More than 300 famous Burmese writers, poets, musicians, artists... attended the meeting. Including U Khin Maung, President of the Burmese Academy of Arts, U Tin Pe Myint, a famous writer, Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, a famous poet, U Aung Lun, a famous painter, U Ba Yin Galay, Dr. Htin Aung, Chairman of the Burma-China Friendship Association, and U Wunna, the Burmese-Soviet Cultural Association...

Next to the lawn is Yangon's famous and beautiful Green Lake. The lake surface is as calm as a mirror, without waves or ripples. The distant hills and trees are quietly reflected in the lake. Occasionally, a few geese fly over. As if afraid of disturbing the tranquility of the lake, they fly quietly and then quietly fly away.

The Chinese Cultural Delegation met with Burmese writers and artists in this poetic place. U Chan Tha, Chairman of the Burmese Writers Association, who had seen the performance of the Chinese Cultural Delegation, stood up. He first expressed a warm welcome to the Chinese Cultural Delegation and said that China and Burma are very close in terms of music and dance. The cultures of China and Burma are basically similar, and he hoped to redevelop the cultural relations that Asian people had in ancient times. Artist U Aung Lun further said: "The second visit of the Cultural Delegation of the People's Republic of China to Burma symbolizes that the road of cultural exchange between China and Burma is becoming wider. I believe that the efforts of these cultural envoys will consolidate China-Burma friendship and realize peace in Asia and the world."

Writers and artists are spokespersons for the people. They expressed the Burmese people's desire for China-Burma friendship and the realization of peace in Asia and the world. Those who did not have time to speak at the meeting also wrote letters to express their welcome and hope. U Ko Ko Latt of the Burmese New Pen Friends Association wrote us a special letter. Burmese writers and artists who participated in this grand event had cordial conversations with Chinese writers and artists and discussed their experiences in the cultural and artistic fields. Friends from the film and drama circles brought cameras to film scenes of China-Burma friendship. Famous Burmese painters used their pens to sketch and record this meeting of friendship and exchange of feelings on the shore of Green Lake.

A gust of hot wind blew from the lake. This hot wind was like the host's hospitality, making us feel warm. We ate Burma's famous "Tangmi Fen" (noodles) and sweet snacks while talking about the development of the literary and artistic circles of China and Burma. No one paid attention to how long we talked, but everyone had a common feeling: the time was too short. We had countless experiences to exchange, and we had countless literary and artistic issues to study, but according to the schedule, we had to go elsewhere. Everyone shook hands tightly, reluctant to let go. We walked out, and the hosts also walked out. We got into the car, and their friendly eyes stared at us from very, very far away.

At the Chang Ming Da Xi Airport in the ancient capital of Mandalay, there was another moving scene. People stood under the scorching sun, watching us with excited eyes, welcoming us with warm applause and cheers:

Long live China-Burma friendship!

Long live world peace!

Standing at the forefront of the welcoming crowd were more than one hundred Burmese women holding flowers. They were all wearing transparent snow-white nylon tops and gauze-woven bright red sarongs. This dazzling red light was particularly conspicuous under the scorching sun, symbolizing the fire-like burning friendship. As soon as we got off the plane, we felt the warm friendship rushing towards us.

Standing in front of the Burmese women to greet us were Burmese Federal Minister of Culture U Win, Mandalay Mayor U Kyaw Nyein, all members of the Mandalay City Council, and representatives of various people's organizations. We had met Minister U Win in Yangon, and he had specially come to Mandalay to meet us. We felt even more cordial when we met. After receiving the flowers from the Burmese women, we followed Minister U Win and Mayor U Kyaw Nyein out of the welcoming line. There was also a welcoming shed near the airport gate, and this shed was full of welcoming people.

This was a palace-style, quaint welcoming shed, with the pillars of the gate decorated with golden patterns, and the front of the gate adorned with palm trees, holly trees, and broad-leaved plants with large, lush leaves, verdant and dripping with green.

On the morning of the day we arrived in Mandalay, every street and every alley in Mandalay, high-rise buildings, bungalows, and thatched houses, every household opened its windows, and the city was filled with a joyful atmosphere. Everyone knew that the Cultural Delegation of the People's Republic of China was visiting Mandalay today.

China-Burma friendship can be seen everywhere. The famous Burmese historian and writer Saya Htin Gyi said it well: "Prime Minister U Nu's invitation to the Chinese Cultural Delegation to visit Burma during his visit to China was warmly supported by the Burmese people. It is a glorious thing to be friends with 600 million Chinese people. Our two countries have had traditional friendly relations in history, and now new friendships have emerged. The five principles in the joint statement of the two Prime Ministers are the common will of the people of the two countries, and the visit of the Cultural Delegation to Burma is a concrete manifestation of the shining light of the five principles." U Ba Than, chairman of the Ancient Qin Music Association, spoke from his personal feelings: "Our friendship is as close as brothers, as the lyrics say. I believe that cultural exchange is conducive to peace. Our two countries have a long-standing friendship, and mutual visits by cultural delegations will make the flowers of peace and friendship bloom everywhere. The Chinese people are as close as brothers to the Burmese people. At a banquet the day before yesterday, a friend offered me a cup of Chinese tea, which touched my thoughts, and my mind was recalling the meticulous hospitality I received in China. This time, the Cultural Delegation came to Burma for a visit, and I welcome my brothers from afar with a fiery heart. I hope to fulfill the duties of the host, and as long as the Chinese Cultural Delegation has a happy impression during their visit to Burma, that will be our happiness."

Everywhere we heard these warm welcoming words from the Burmese people, and everywhere we encountered sparks of friendship from the Burmese people towards the Chinese people. A Burmese friend said: "The friendship between China and Burma is as brilliant as the Shwedagon Pagoda and as evergreen as green cypress!" This is the common desire of the people of China and Burma, and this is a broad road illuminated by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

We need friendship. We need peace.

During my visit to Burma, I visited Yangon, Mandalay, Maymyo, and Sagaing. Another very deep impression on me was the strong desire for peace of the Burmese government and the Burmese people. From the moment I entered Burma until I went to every place and met people from all walks of life in Burma, I could hear enthusiastic calls for peace.

When I visited the Yangon University Library, the librarian told me: There are only tens of thousands of books at present. All the previous collections were destroyed by the war, and now they are being collected again, so the number is very small. At the reception at Yangon University, the Vice-Chancellor of Yangon University pointed to the auditorium and told me: This was recently built. The original auditorium was destroyed by the war.

In Mandalay, Mandalay Mayor U Kyaw Nyein told me even more sadly: "It is very regrettable that we were unable to show the Cultural Delegation the palace that was originally built in Mandalay. Our beautiful buildings have been destroyed in the war. The old Mandalay capital has disappeared, and a new Mandalay is now being built on the ruins." During my visit to Mandalay, I lived in a villa next to this beautiful royal city. In the early morning and at dusk, I almost had to look through the dense shade of trees every day to see the city walls of this beautiful building and the pagoda-shaped watchtowers made of teak on the city walls. The watchtowers reflected in the moat were even more beautiful. But this is only from the outside.

One day, I and several members of the Cultural Delegation walked in, and what appeared in front of us was a ruin. If no one had introduced it, no one would have thought that this was the famous royal city of Mandalay. The palace was gone, and flat houses were being built on the ruins. Only from the model of the royal city in the house next to the main hall can you marvel at how beautiful this building is. But now, the old Mandalay capital has disappeared.

In Burma, traces of destruction from the war can be seen almost everywhere, not only in Mandalay, Maymyo, and Sagaing, but also in Yangon City.

Having personally experienced the pain of World War II, the Burmese people issued a strong demand for peace from the bottom of their hearts.

Culture, friendship, and peace are the common demands of the people of China and Burma, and also the common demands of the people of Asia and the world. Under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, we must oppose wars of aggression, build our culture, consolidate and develop our friendship, and defend peace in Asia and the world. Finally, I want to end this short article with the Burma-China Friendship Song that has spread throughout Burma:

We are close comrades-in-arms like flesh and blood,
We must unite and cooperate closely,
With the weapons of Burma-China friendship,
We defend world peace.

    在缅甸的日子
    中华人民共和国访问缅甸文化代表团副团长　周而复
    一九五五年二月四日早晨，我们从仰光海滨旅馆步行到马路对面的路易士路码头，走上“敏达米”号轮船。这是一只游艇，舱顶上悬挂着无数中缅两国的小国旗，在两国小国旗之间交差地排着红红绿绿的花朵和气球。
    我们和缅甸朋友们混合地坐着，看见海滨旅馆离我们远去，耸立在绿荫丛中的金光灿烂的仰光大金塔也离我们远去，“敏达米”号在秀丽的伊洛瓦底江上静静地航行。
    在紫红的地毡上，缅甸师范学校的女学生为我们表演“缅甸插秧舞”和“缅甸长鼓舞”；缅甸广播电台著名的歌唱家都美丹、电影名演员珍珍木和音乐家盛巴智给我们演唱了缅甸古代的和近代的歌曲。
    表演完了，中国和缅甸的文艺界朋友分别坐在小方桌上亲密地交谈，语言不能阻隔我们的友情。京剧演员黄玉华同志和缅甸著名演员珍珍木在用手势和表情谈话，她并且向珍珍木学习缅甸话。她打开小本子一边记录，一边谈心。珍珍木的缅甸话里夹一两句中国话，黄玉华的中国话里也带一两句刚学会的缅甸话。
    在另外一张桌子上女低音董爱琳在跟缅甸著名歌唱家都美丹学唱缅甸歌，一面唱一面谈。在董爱琳身后，有几个中国年青舞蹈演员围着一位缅甸中年的舞蹈家在研究中国和缅甸舞蹈的异同。缅甸联邦政府驻我国大使吴拉茂和我们坐在靠船边栏杆那儿，谈论中国和缅甸的风尚和习俗。……
      “敏达米”号是一只友谊之船，航行在和平的伊洛瓦底江上。我们尽情地进行文化交流。这一次愉快的航行给我留下来深刻的印象。
    同样的，在仰光绿漪湖畔缅甸联邦俱乐部旁边草场上的一次盛会也是叫我难以忘记的。这是二月一日上午十点半钟。缅甸作家协会和美术家协会联合举行的盛大招待会欢迎我们。出席这个大会的有三百多位缅甸著名的作家、诗人、音乐家、美术家……。其中包括缅甸艺术学院院长吴钦貌，著名作家吴登佩密，著名诗人德贡达耶，著名画家吴昂伦，吴巴印格礼，缅中友好协会主席信波博士，缅苏文化协会吴旺纳……
    草场旁边就是仰光有名的幽美的绿漪湖，湖面像镜子一样的平静，没有波浪，也没有涟漪，远处的小山和树木静静地倒映在湖里。偶尔有几只雁子飞过。它好像也怕扰乱了湖面的平静，悄悄地飞来，又悄悄地飞去。
    中国文化代表团和缅甸文学家和艺术家就在这富有诗意的地方见面了。曾经看过中国文化代表团演出的缅甸作家协会主席吴阵发站起来了，他首先表示对中国文化代表团的热烈欢迎，并说音乐和舞蹈方面中国和缅甸很接近，中国和缅甸的文化基本上是相接近的，希望从新发展亚洲人民在古代就已有的文化关系。美术家吴昂伦进一步说：“中华人民共和国文化代表团的第二次访问缅甸，是象征了中缅两国文化交流的道路更加宽阔，我相信这些文化使者的努力将会巩固中缅友谊和实现亚洲和世界和平的。”
    文学家和艺术家是人民的代言人，他们道出了缅甸人民对中缅友谊和实现亚洲和世界和平的愿望。没有时间在会上讲话的，也写信来表示他们的欢迎和希望。缅甸新笔友会的吴哥哥礼就特别给我们写来了信。参加这个盛会的缅甸文学家和艺术家同中国的文学家和艺术家亲切地交谈，讨论两国文化艺术上的经验。电影戏剧界的朋友们带来了摄影机，在拍摄中缅友谊的镜头。缅甸著名的画家们用笔在速写，纪录这绿漪湖畔友谊的会见和心声的交流。
    湖面吹过来一阵阵热风，这热风像是主人招待的感情，使我们感到温暖。我们一边吃着缅甸著名的“汤米粉”和甜的点心，一边谈着中缅两国文艺界发展情况，谁也不注意谈了多久，但都有一个共同的感觉：就是时间太短，我们有无数的经验要交流，我们有无数的文艺问题要研究，可是按照日程的安排，我们还得到别的地方去。大家紧紧地握着手，谁也依依地不肯放开，我们走出来，主人们也走了出来；我们上了车，他们友情的眼光盯着我们看了很远很远。
      在曼德勒故都的昌名达西机场上，是又一个动人的情景。人们站在炽热的太阳下，用兴奋的眼光注视我们，用热烈的掌声和欢呼声欢迎我们：
    中缅友好万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    站在欢迎人群前列的是一百多位手执鲜花的缅甸妇女，她们一律穿着透明的雪白的尼龙上衣和纱织的大红色沙龙。这一片闪耀着的红光，在炽热的太阳下特别显目，象征着火一般燃烧着的友谊。我们一下飞机就感到迎面扑来的温暖的友谊。
    站在缅甸妇女前面迎接我们的是缅甸联邦文化部部长吴温、曼德勒市市长吴叫纽、曼德勒市的全体议员和各人民团体的代表们。吴温部长，我们在仰光就见过了，他特地先到曼德勒来接我们。我们见了面感到更加亲切。接过缅甸妇女的献花，我们随着吴温部长和吴叫纽市长走出欢迎的行列，在机场近门那儿还有一个欢迎棚，这棚里坐满了欢迎的人群。
    这是一座宫殿式的古色古香的欢迎彩棚，大门的柱子上装饰着金色的花纹，门前还点缀着棕榈树、冬青树和枝大叶肥的阔叶植物，青翠欲滴。
    在我们到达曼德勒的那天早上，曼德勒的每一条街，每一条巷，高楼大厦，平房茅屋，家家户户都打开了窗户，市里到处充满了喜洋洋的气氛，大家知道中华人民共和国文化代表团今天要访问曼德勒了。
    中缅的友谊是到处可以看见的。缅甸著名文史学家西耶兴说得好：“吴努总理访华期间邀请中国文化代表团访缅，这一举动，受到缅甸人民热烈拥护。和六亿中国人民做朋友是件光荣的大事。我们两国在历史上就有着传统的友好关系，如今又产生了新的友谊。两国总理声明中的五项原则是两国人民共同的意志，而文化代表团访缅，正是五项原则光辉照耀下的具体表现。”古琴音乐家协会主席吴巴丹更从他个人亲身的感受来说：“我们的友谊就像歌词里所说的亲如兄弟。我认为文化交流有助于和平，我们两国已经有悠久的友谊，互派文化代表团访问将使和平友谊花朵处处开放。中国人民对缅甸人民亲如兄弟。在前天一个宴会上，有位朋友敬我一杯中国茶，触动了我的思绪，我脑子里又在回忆起在中国时所受的无微不至的招待。这次文化代表团来缅访问，我带着火热的心情欢迎来自远方的兄弟。我希望能尽主人之谊，只要中国文化代表团在缅访问时间得到快乐的印象，那也就是我们的快乐。”
    我们到处听到缅甸人民这样热情欢迎的辞句，到处遇到缅甸人民对中国人民的友谊的火花。有一位缅甸朋友说：“中缅的友情像大金塔一样的灿烂，绿松柏一样的常青呵！”这是中缅人民共同的愿望，这是和平共处五项原则所照亮了的一条大道。
    我们需要友谊。我们需要和平。
    我在访问缅甸期间，曾经到过仰光、曼德勒、眉苗和实阶，给我另一个非常深刻的印象是缅甸政府和缅甸人民对和平强烈的愿望。从我一进入缅甸起，以至到每一个地方，见到缅甸各阶层的人士，全可以听到要求和平的热烈的呼声。
    我去参观仰光大学图书馆的时候，图书馆馆长对我说：目前只有几万册书，以前所有的藏书叫战争给毁了，现在从新收集起，所以数量很少。在仰光大学的招待会上，仰光大学副校长指着大礼堂给我讲：这是最近新盖的，原来的大礼堂给战争毁了。
    在曼德勒，曼德勒市长吴叫纽对我说得更沉痛：“我们未能把曼德勒原有建筑起来的宫殿给文化代表团参观，是非常遗憾的。我们的美丽的建筑已在战争中毁坏了，旧的曼德勒故都已消逝了，现在正在废墟上建设着新曼德勒。”我在曼德勒访问期间，就住在这座美丽的皇城旁边的一幢别墅里，在清晨，在黄昏，每天我几乎都要透过浓密的树荫看一看这座美丽建筑的城墙和城墙上的用柚木造成的塔形的城楼。城楼映在护城河里更加美丽。不过这只是从外边看。
    有一天，我和文化代表团的几个团员走进去了，出现在眼前的是一片废墟，如果没有人介绍，绝对想不到这就是有名的曼德勒的皇城。宫殿没有了，在废墟上开始建起一座座平房。只有从正殿旁边的那幢屋子里的皇城模型上，你才可以惊叹这座建筑是多么美丽。但是现在，旧的曼德勒的故都已经消逝了。
    在缅甸，几乎到处可以看到被战争毁坏的痕迹，不但是在曼德勒，在眉苗，在实阶，就是在仰光市，也可以看到一些。
    亲身经历过第二次世界大战苦痛的缅甸人民，从内心里发出对和平的强烈的要求。
    文化、友谊和和平是中缅两国人民共同的要求，也是亚洲人民和世界人民的共同要求。我们要在和平共处五项原则的指导下，反对侵略战争，建设我们的文化，巩固和发展我们的友谊，保卫亚洲和世界的和平。最后，我要用传遍了缅甸国土的缅中友好歌来结束这篇短文：
    我们是亲如骨肉的战友，
    要亲密无间地团结合作，
    带着缅中友好的武器，
    我们保卫着世界和平。
