(Xinhua News Agency note: The full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's supplementary speech at the Asian-African Conference on the 19th, dispatched by this agency on the 19th, was translated from the English manuscript. The Chinese original of Premier Zhou Enlai's supplementary speech has now been received. It is now being republished.)

Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates:

My main speech has now been distributed to everyone. After listening to the speeches of many delegation leaders, I would like to add a few words.

The Chinese delegation is here to seek unity, not to quarrel. We Communists never conceal that we believe in Communism and that the socialist system is good. However, at this conference, there is no need to promote personal ideologies and the political systems of various countries, although such differences clearly exist among us.

The Chinese delegation is here to seek common ground, not to create differences. Is there a basis for seeking common ground among us? Yes. That is, the vast majority of Asian and African countries and peoples have suffered and are still suffering from the disasters and pains caused by colonialism since modern times. This is something we all acknowledge. By finding a common ground in relieving the pain and disasters of colonialism, we can easily understand and respect each other, sympathize with and support each other, instead of being suspicious and fearful of each other, excluding and opposing each other. That is why we agree with the four objectives of the Asian-African Conference announced at the Bogor Conference of the Five Prime Ministers without offering other suggestions.

Originally, regarding the tense situation in the Taiwan area created single-handedly by the United States, we could have proposed here, like the Soviet Union, a proposal to convene an international conference to seek a solution and requested the conference to discuss it. The demand of the Chinese people to liberate their territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands is just, which is entirely an internal affair and an exercise of their own sovereignty, and has the support of many countries. We could also have proposed that the conference discuss the issue of recognizing and restoring the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. Last year, the Colombo Five Prime Ministers' Conference, as well as other Asian and African countries, supported the position of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. Moreover, the unfair treatment China has received in the United Nations could also be criticized here. However, we did not do this. Because doing so would easily plunge our conference into debates on these issues without a resolution.

Our conference should seek common ground while reserving differences. At the same time, the conference should affirm these common aspirations and demands. This is the main issue among us. We do not ask everyone to abandon their own views, because this is a reflection of what actually exists. But it should not prevent us from reaching a common agreement on major issues. We should also understand and value each other's different views on a common basis.

Now, I would like to talk first about the issue of different ideologies and social systems. We should admit that there are different ideologies and social systems in Asian and African countries, but this does not prevent us from seeking common ground and unity. After World War II, many independent countries emerged in Asia and Africa, one type being countries led by the Communist Party; the other type being countries led by nationalists. The former type of countries are not many. But what some people dislike is that 600 million Chinese people have chosen a political system led by the Chinese Communist Party, belonging to the socialist system, and are no longer ruled by imperialism. There are many countries of the latter type, such as India, Burma, Indonesia, and many Asian and African countries. Both types of our countries have gained independence from colonial rule and are still continuing to fight for complete independence. What reason do we have not to understand and respect each other, sympathize with and support each other? The Five Principles can fully serve as the basis for establishing friendly cooperation and good-neighborly relations among us. Our Asian and African countries, including China, are very backward economically and culturally. Since our Asian-African Conference does not exclude anyone, why can't we understand each other and cooperate in a friendly manner?

Secondly, I want to talk about the issue of freedom of religious belief. Freedom of religious belief is a principle commonly recognized by modern countries. We Communists are atheists, but we respect people with religious beliefs. We hope that people with religious beliefs should also respect people without religious beliefs. China is a country with freedom of religious belief. It not only has 7 million Communist Party members, but also tens of millions of Muslims and Buddhists, and millions of Christians and Catholics. The Chinese delegation includes a devout Islamic Imam. These situations do not hinder the internal unity of China. Why can't we unite people with religious beliefs and those without religious beliefs in the big family of Asian and African countries? The era of provoking religious disputes should be over, because it is not any of us who benefit from provoking such disputes.

Thirdly, I want to talk about the issue of so-called subversive activities. The Chinese people's struggle against colonialism has lasted for more than a hundred years. The national democratic revolutionary struggle led by the Chinese Communist Party has also gone through nearly thirty years of hardship before finally achieving success. The suffering of the Chinese people under imperialism, feudalism, and Chiang Kai-shek's rule is countless, and they finally chose this national system and the current government. The Chinese revolution achieved victory through the efforts of the Chinese people, and it was definitely not imported from abroad. Even those who dislike the victory of the Chinese revolution cannot deny this. There is an old Chinese saying: "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." We oppose foreign interference, so why would we interfere in the internal affairs of others? Some say that there are more than ten million overseas Chinese abroad who may use their dual nationality to carry out subversive activities. However, the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese is a legacy of the old China. Chiang Kai-shek is still using a very small number of overseas Chinese to carry out sabotage activities against their countries of residence. The People's Government of New China is prepared to resolve the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese with the governments of relevant countries. Others say that the Dai Autonomous Region in China threatens others. There are more than 40 million ethnic minorities of dozens of kinds in China, including nearly 10 million Dai and Zhuang people of the same system. Since they exist, we must give them the right to autonomy. Just as Burma has the Shan State, all ethnic minorities in China have their autonomous regions. How can it be said that the exercise of autonomous rights by ethnic minorities in China within China threatens neighboring countries? We are now prepared to establish normal relations with Asian and African countries, and even countries around the world, especially our neighbors, on the basis of upholding the Five Principles. The problem now is not that we are subverting other people's governments, but that someone is establishing bases around China to carry out subversive activities against the Chinese government. For example, there are remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's armed forces on the Burmese border, carrying out sabotage against China and Burma. Because of the friendship between China and Burma, we have always respected Burma's sovereignty and trusted the Burmese government to resolve this issue.

The Chinese people choose and support their own government, China has freedom of religious belief, and China has no intention of subverting the governments of neighboring countries. On the contrary, China is suffering from the harm of the U.S. government's openly carrying out subversive activities. If you don't believe it, you can go to China to see for yourselves or send people to see. We allow people who do not know the truth to doubt. There is a Chinese saying: "Seeing is believing." We welcome all the representatives of the participating countries to visit China, and you can go whenever you want. We do not have a bamboo curtain, but others want to create a smokescreen between us.

One billion six hundred million Asian and African people expect our conference to succeed. Countries and peoples all over the world who desire peace expect our conference to contribute to expanding the area of peace and establishing collective peace. Let us Asian and African countries unite and strive for the success of the Asian-African Conference!

### 在亚非会议十九日下午全体会议上  周恩来总理的补充发言

    在亚非会议十九日下午全体会议上
    周恩来总理的补充发言
    （新华社按：十九日本社发的周恩来总理十九日在亚非会议上的补充发言全文，是根据英文稿译出的。现已收到周恩来总理补充发言的中文原文。特重新发表。）主席，各位代表：
    我的主要发言现在印发给大家了。在听到了许多代表团团长的一些发言之后，我愿补充说几句话。
    中国代表团是来求团结而不是来吵架的。我们共产党人从不讳言我们相信共产主义和认为社会主义制度是好的。但是，在这个会议上用不着来宣传个人的思想意识和各国的政治制度，虽然这种不同在我们中间显然是存在的。
    中国代表团是来求同而不是来立异的。在我们中间有无求同的基础呢？有的。那就是亚非绝大多数国家和人民自近代以来都曾经受过、并且现在仍在受着殖民主义所造成的灾难和痛苦。这是我们大家都承认的。从解除殖民主义痛苦和灾难中找共同基础，我们就很容易互相了解和尊重、互相同情和支持，而不是互相疑虑和恐惧、互相排斥和对立。这就是为什么我们同意五国总理茂物会议所宣布的关于亚非会议的四项目的，而不另提建议。
    本来，对于美国一手造成的台湾地区的紧张局势，我们很可以在这里提出如同苏联所提出的召开国际会议谋求解决的议案，请求会议加以讨论。中国人民解放自己领土台湾和沿海岛屿的要求是正义的，这完全是内政和行使自己的主权，并得到许多国家的支持。我们也很可以提议会议讨论承认和恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位问题。去年，科伦坡五国总理会议，还有亚非其他国家，都曾经支持中华人民共和国在联合国的地位。而且，中国在联合国所受的不公正待遇，也可以在这里提出批评。但是，我们并没有这样做。因为，这样一来，就很容易使我们的会议陷入对这些问题的争论而得不到解决。
    我们的会议应该求同而存异。同时，会议应将这些共同愿望和要求肯定下来。这是我们中间的主要问题。我们并不要求各人放弃自己的见解，因为这是实际存在的反映。但是不应该使它妨碍我们在主要问题上达成共同的协议。我们还应在共同的基础上来互相了解和重视彼此的不同见解。
    现在，我首先谈不同的思想意识和社会制度问题。我们应该承认，在亚非国家中是存在有不同的思想意识和社会制度的，但这并不妨碍我们求同和团结。第二次大战后，亚非两洲兴起了许多独立国家，一类是共产党领导的国家；一类是民族主义者领导的国家。前一类国家并不多。但是某些人所不喜欢的，就是六万万中国人民选择了中国共产党领导的、属于社会主义体系的政治制度，而不再为帝国主义所统治了。后一类国家很多，像印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和亚非许多国家都是。我们这两类国家都是从殖民主义的统治下独立起来的，并且还在继续为完全独立而奋斗。我们有什么理由不可以互相了解和尊重、互相同情和支持呢？五项原则完全可以成为在我们中间建立友好合作和亲善睦邻关系的基础。我们亚非国家，中国也在内，不论在经济上或文化上，都很落后。我们亚非会议既不要排斥任何人，为什么我们自己反倒不能互相了解、不能友好合作呢？
    次之，我要谈有无宗教信仰自由的问题。宗教信仰自由是近代国家所共同承认的原则。我们共产党人是无神论者，但是我们尊重有宗教信仰的人。我们希望有宗教信仰的人也应该尊重无宗教信仰的人。中国是有宗教信仰自由的国家，它不仅有七百万共产党员，并且还有以千万计的回教徒和佛教徒、以百万计的基督教徒和天主教徒。中国代表团中就有虔诚的伊斯兰教的阿訇。这些情况并不妨碍中国内部的团结，为什么在亚非国家的大家庭中不能将有宗教信仰的和没有宗教信仰的人团结在一起呢？挑起宗教纷争的时代应该过去了，因为从挑起那种纷争中得到利益的并不是我们中间的人。
    第三，我要谈所谓颠覆活动的问题。中国人民为反对殖民主义所进行的斗争超过一百年。中国共产党领导的民族、民主的革命斗争也经历了近三十年的艰难困苦的过程，才终于达到了成功。中国人民在帝国主义、封建主义和蒋介石统治下所受的苦难是数也数不尽的，最后才选择了这个国家制度和现在的政府。中国革命是依靠中国人民的努力取得胜利的，决不是从外输入的，这一点连不喜欢中国革命胜利的人也不能否认。中国古话说：“己所不欲，勿施于人。”我们反对外来干涉，为什么我们会去干涉别人的内政呢？有人说，中国在国外有一千多万华侨，可能利用他们的双重国籍来进行颠覆活动。但是，华侨的双重国籍问题是旧中国遗留下来的，蒋介石至今还在利用极少数的华侨进行对所在国的破坏活动。新中国的人民政府却准备与有关各国政府解决华侨的双重国籍问题。又有人说，在中国境内有傣族自治区威胁了别人。中国境内有四千多万的几十种少数民族，其中傣族和相同系统的僮族将近千万人。他们既然存在，我们就必须给他们自治权利。好像缅甸有掸族自治邦一样，在中国境内各个少数民族都有他们的自治区。中国少数民族在中国境内实行自治权利，如何能说威胁邻邦呢？我们现在准备在坚守五项原则的基础上与亚非各国、乃至世界各国、首先是我们的邻邦，建立正常关系。现在的问题不是我们去颠覆别人的政府，倒是有人在中国的周围建立进行颠覆中国政府的据点。譬如在缅甸边境就存在着蒋介石集团的残余武装分子，对中缅两国进行破坏。因为中缅友好，我们一直尊重缅甸的主权，信任缅甸政府去解决这个问题。
    中国人民选择和拥护自己的政府，中国有宗教信仰自由，中国决无颠覆邻邦政府的意图。相反的，中国正在受着美国政府公言不讳地进行颠覆活动的害处。大家如果不信，可亲自或派人到中国去看。我们是容许不知真相的人怀疑的。中国俗语说：
  “百闻不如一见。”我们欢迎所有到会的各国代表到中国去参观，你们什么时候去都可以。我们没有竹幕，倒是别人要在我们之间施放烟幕。
    十六万万的亚非人民期待着我们的会议成功。全世界愿意和平的国家和人民期待着我们的会议能为扩大和平区域和建立集体和平有所贡献。让我们亚非国家团结起来、为亚非会议的成功努力吧！
