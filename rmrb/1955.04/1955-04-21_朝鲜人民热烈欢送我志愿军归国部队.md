Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 20th. Since March 31st, every day as the sun just rises, the platform of the Sinuiju station on the south bank of the Yalu River has been filled with Korean people holding colorful flags and bouquets. They cheer and sing all day long, seeing off train after train carrying the returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops as they cross the Yalu River Bridge.

　In these days, many moving stories have emerged on the banks of the Yalu River.

　　Eighty-two-year-old Korean mother Choi Kwan-sook said to the returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers: "You came to Korea for peace and helped us win peace; now you are going back. People can leave, but how can hearts leave!" Every day, she tirelessly travels from her home two or three miles away to the station, squeezing to the front of the crowd seeing them off, until she sees off the last train of the day before returning home.

    A gray-haired Korean old mother, during one send-off of returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops, excitedly grabbed a Volunteer Army soldier's hand and put a silver ring she had from her wedding day on the soldier's finger. She said: "Child, leave this little memento and always remember a Korean mother's gratitude to you!" Four years ago, this old mother's son, Kim Sang-bae, was a gunner in the Korean People's Army. During a joint operation with Volunteer Army soldiers, he encountered enemy aircraft bombing, and Kim Sang-bae was seriously injured and buried in the dirt thrown up by the bombs. Volunteer Army soldiers braved the smoke and shrapnel to rescue Kim Sang-bae and promptly sent him to the hospital. After recovering from his injuries, Kim Sang-bae returned to work in a factory. Now, he is sick and unable to come to the station to see them off in person, so the old mother brings her own and her son's deep gratitude to see them off.

    A Korean girl, Kang Young-sook, was searching everywhere in the returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops for "Comrade Wang." It turned out that two years ago, a Volunteer Army medical worker named Wang had cured Kang Young-sook's mother of a serious illness. For two years, the mother and daughter have been remembering and grateful to "Comrade Wang." Recently, when they heard that some of the Volunteer Army was returning to China, her mother specially made a pair of cloth socks and sent her daughter to give them to "Comrade Wang" as a memento.

    朝鲜人民热烈欢送我志愿军归国部队
    据新华社平壤二十日电　从三月三十一日以来，每天当太阳刚刚升起的时候，鸭绿江南岸新义州车站月台上，便聚满了手执彩旗和花束的朝鲜人民。他们整日不散地欢呼着、歌唱着，欢送一列列载着中国人民志愿军归国部队的列车驶上鸭绿江桥。
  　在这些日子里，鸭绿江畔出现许多动人的事情。
    八十二岁的白发苍苍的朝鲜妈妈崔冠淑向志愿军归国部队的战士们说：“你们为了和平到朝鲜来，帮助我们争得了和平；现在你们回去了。人能离开，心怎能离得开呢！”每天，她总是不辞辛劳地从二、三里外的家赶到车站，挤到送别的人群前面，一直到送别了当日的最后一次列车，她才走回家去。
    一位鬓发斑白的朝鲜老妈妈在一次欢送志愿军归国部队时，激动地抓住一个志愿军战士的手，把她当年结婚时的一个银戒指，套在战士的手指上。她道：“孩子，留下这个小纪念品，永远记住一个朝鲜妈妈对你们的感谢吧！”四年前，这位老妈妈的儿子金尚培是朝鲜人民军的炮手，在一次同志愿军战士并肩作战的时候，遭遇了敌机的轰炸，金尚培负了重伤，被埋在炸弹掀起的泥土里。志愿军战士们冒着烟火和弹片把金尚培抢救了出来，并及时送到了医院。金尚培在伤愈复员后，到一个工厂里当了工人。现在，他患着病，不能亲自到车站来欢送，老妈妈便带着她自己和儿子的深厚的感激之情来送行。
    一位朝鲜姑娘康永淑，曾在志愿军归国部队里到处寻找“王同志”。原来是在两年前有一位姓王的志愿军医务工作人员治好了康永淑的母亲的重病。两年来，她们母女一直怀念和感激着“王同志”。最近，当她们听说一部分志愿军要回中国时，她的母亲就特地赶做了一双布袜子，派女儿赶来送给“王同志”作纪念。
