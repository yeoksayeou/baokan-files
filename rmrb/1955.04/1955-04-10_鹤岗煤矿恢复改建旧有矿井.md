Hegang Coal Mine Restores and Reconstructs Old Mine Shafts

The work of restoring and reconstructing old mine shafts at the Hegang Coal Mine has achieved great success. To date, three of the restored and reconstructed mine shafts can have their lifespans extended by more than ten years, four can be extended by three to five years, and one can be extended by two years. The coal production from these mine shafts already accounts for more than 27 percent of the overall output of the entire bureau. Hegang will also undertake restoration and reconstruction work on an even larger scale this year. This year's workload will be three to four times greater than in 1954. Nine mine shafts will be reconstructed, and the reconstruction of one mine shaft will continue to be completed. To strengthen the restoration and reconstruction of old mine shafts, the Mining Bureau recently held a special cadre meeting.

    鹤岗煤矿恢复改建旧有矿井
    鹤岗煤矿恢复改建旧矿井的工作已取得很大成就。到目前为止，已恢复改建的矿井，有三个可延长寿命十年以上，四个可延长三年至五年，一个可延长二年。这些矿井的产煤量已占全局总产量的百分之二十七以上。今年鹤岗还要进行规模更大的恢复改建工作。今年的工程量要比一九五四年大三倍到四倍。有九个矿井要进行改建，一个矿井继续完成改建。为加强对旧有矿井的恢复改建工作，矿务局不久前专门举行了干部会议。
