    Educating Employees to Cherish Machinery and Equipment
    Not long ago, Tianjin Daily, under the instruction of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, conducted a campaign to promote the importance of cherishing machinery and equipment. On January 15th, the newspaper published the Municipal Committee's instructions on this matter and an editorial entitled "Cherishing Machinery and Equipment is the Solemn Task of Every Employee." Subsequently, it continuously reported on the situation of various factories mobilizing employees to inspect and maintain machinery and equipment. Using the incident of Ning Fuhai, a worker at the Tianjin Automobile Manufacturing and Assembly Plant, damaging machines three times in a row, it organized a reader discussion lasting nearly a month, starting on February 8th.
    Workers, foremen, technicians, secretaries of Party branches and general branches, and Party branch committees participated in this discussion. The discussion criticized Ning Fuhai's individualistic behavior of only caring about his salary and face, and not cherishing the state's machinery. Most readers, in their submissions, examined their own thoughts and work. For example, a foreman expressed his determination to correct the erroneous practice of only focusing on completing production plans and neglecting machine maintenance and repair. A branch secretary stated that, in the future, he would pay attention to regularly conducting political and ideological education on cherishing machinery among workers.
    Machinery and equipment are weapons on our socialist industrialization construction front. Especially today, with highly automated factories being successively put into production, and a few existing factories constantly adding new machines, while workers are unfamiliar with these machines and equipment, educating employees to cherish machinery and equipment becomes even more urgent. Tianjin Daily's approach is worth promoting.

    教育职工爱护机器设备
    不久以前，天津日报在中共天津市委会的指示下，进行了爱护机器设备的宣传。报纸在一月十五日发表了市委的关于这一问题的指示和题为“爱护机器设备是每个职工的庄严任务”的社论，以后即连续报道了各厂发动职工检查爱护机器设备的情况，并以天津汽车制配厂工人宁福海连续三次损坏机器的事件，从二月八日起组织了为时将近一月的读者讨论。
    参加这次讨论的有工人、工长、技师、党的支部和总支的书记，以及党支部委员会等。讨论中批判了宁福海平日只关心自己的工资和面子，不爱护国家机器的个人主义行为。大多数读者在来稿来信中，都联系检查了本身的思想和工作。例如，一个工长表示要决心改正只顾完成生产计划，而不注意机器检修和维护的错误作法。一个支部书记则表示，今后要注意经常地向工人进行爱护机器的政治思想教育。
    机器设备是我们社会主义工业化建设战线上的武器，特别是在今天高度自动化的工厂正陆续投入生产，少数原有的工厂也在不断地增加新的机器，而在工人对这些机器设备都很生疏的情况下，教育职工爱护机器设备，就有了更为迫切的意义。天津日报的这种作法是值得提倡的。
