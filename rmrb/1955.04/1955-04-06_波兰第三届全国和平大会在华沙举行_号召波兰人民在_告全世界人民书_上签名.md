Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 5th: According to a TASS report from Warsaw on April 4th: The Third National Peace Congress of Poland was held in Warsaw on April 3rd. More than nine hundred representatives from various provinces of Poland attended the meeting. Invited to participate in the meeting were representatives of the World Peace Council, peace activists from the Soviet Union, France, Germany, Czechoslovakia, and other countries.

Ya. Ivashkevich, Chairman of the Polish Committee for the Defense of Peace, delivered a report at the meeting on the tasks of the Polish peace movement. He pointed out that in Poland, the movement for peace has become a national movement. The struggle for peace, for international security, for unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and cessation of their manufacture, and for a just solution to the German question on the basis of peace and democracy, has become a matter of personal concern for every honest Polish citizen. The World Peace Council's appeal for the destruction of existing atomic weapons and the cessation of their manufacture has received a wide and profound response among all sections of the Polish people.

Ivashkevich said that the ratification of the Paris Agreements poses a direct threat to peace in Europe and the world. The countries of the democratic camp, including Poland, cannot ignore and passively respond to this threat. The Moscow Eight-Nation Conference has affirmed its determination to strengthen our defenses. We will take all measures to ensure the safety of the people of our camp.

Professor Koichi Saionji, a Japanese peace activist, extended warm congratulations to the congress on behalf of the World Peace Council and the Japanese Peace Protection Committee.

Representatives from the Soviet Union, France, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic delivered congratulatory speeches.

The congress elected a new Polish Committee for the Defense of Peace.

The congress passed a resolution calling on the Polish people to sign the World Peace Council's "Appeal to the People of the World." At the end of the congress, the representatives present signed the "Appeal to the People of the World."
