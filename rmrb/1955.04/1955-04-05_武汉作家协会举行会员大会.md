Wuhan Writers Association Holds Members' Congress
    The first members' congress of the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Writers Association, lasting ten days, concluded on March 29. The main tasks of the congress were to convey the spirit of the Second All-Soviet Writers Congress, to study the rich experience of the Soviet Union in its literary endeavors over the past twenty years, which holds world significance; to criticize Hu Feng's bourgeois, subjective, idealist literary thought, and, in light of the local situation, to resolve existing problems in creative thought; and to listen to and review reports on the leadership structure of the branch. The attending members earnestly studied the documents, put forward their views and opinions on various issues, and examined the problems that currently exist in everyone's creative work and thinking. Everyone unanimously agreed that writers can only gradually grasp socialist realism and fully reflect today's reality by immersing themselves in life and studying Marxism-Leninism, standing on the position of the working class, and obtaining a communist worldview.
    Through this congress, everyone gained a further understanding of the rich experience of Soviet literature and used it as a weapon to criticize Hu Feng's anti-Party and anti-Marxist literary thought.
    After the congress, the first meeting of the first council of the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Writers Association was held on March 30. At the meeting, Yu Heiding was elected as the chairman of the branch, and Li Rui and Yu Lin were elected as vice-chairmen. The council also discussed issues such as strengthening leadership in future creative work, developing membership, establishing member groups, strengthening members' political and professional study, and organizing members to immerse themselves in life.

    武汉作家协会举行会员大会
    中国作家协会武汉分会第一届会员大会历时十天，于三月二十九日闭幕。大会的主要任务是传达第二次全苏作家代表大会的精神，学习苏联二十多年来在文学事业上具有世界意义的丰富经验；批判胡风的资产阶级主观唯心论的文艺思想，结合本地区的情况解决创作思想上存在的问题；听取和审查关于分会的领导机构问题的报告。到会会员都认真地研读文件，提出自己对各种问题的看法和意见，并研究了当前大家在创作中和思想中存在的问题。大家一致认为，作家只有在深入生活和学习马克思列宁主义的过程中，站在工人阶级立场和取得共产主义世界观，才能逐渐掌握社会主义现实主义，才能充分反映今天的现实。
    通过这次大会，大家对苏联文学的丰富经验有了进一步的理解，并用它作为武器，批判了胡风反党、反马克思主义的文艺思想。
    大会结束后，在三月三十日举行了中国作家协会武汉分会第一届理事会第一次会议。会上推出于黑丁为分会主席，李蕤、俞林为副主席。理事会上还研究了关于加强今后创作领导，发展会员，成立会员小组，加强会员的政治、业务学习以及组织会员深入生活等问题。　（本报驻武汉记者）
