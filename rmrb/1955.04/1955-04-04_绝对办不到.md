Absolutely Impossible
Jiang Yuanchun

U.S. military aircraft repeatedly violated our country's airspace over Shandong and Guangdong on April 1, conducting armed provocations. This action is part of the scheme that the U.S. aggressive bloc has recently been plotting to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan by escalating war threats.

According to Western news, after the Bangkok Conference, in mid-March, the United States and Australia held secret talks in Washington, formulating a so-called secret plan to "resolve" the Taiwan issue. During the talks, Dulles also made a special trip to Canada to consult with the Canadian government. Afterwards, this plan was discussed among the Commonwealth countries.

From a report in the British "Foreign Affairs Report" magazine on March 24, people came into contact with part of the U.S.-Australian plan. It seems that the United States wants to make an ugly deal with some Commonwealth countries, represented by Australia, using Chinese territory. The meaning of this plan is: if the Chinese people liberate Taiwan, Australia will assist the United States in attacking China, on the condition that "the unsettled status of the coastal islands must first be resolved." At the same time, the United States will also "consider undertaking stronger obligations in the cause of defending Singapore and the Federation of Malaya than it has already undertaken under the Manila Treaty." Reuters reported on March 20 that the purpose of this plan was to create a fait accompli of "two Chinas."

These messages are revealed very clearly. The United States knows very well that its forcible occupation of China's territory of Taiwan, Penghu, and the coastal islands is extremely unpopular, and its position is very isolated. Therefore, it wants to find ways, based on the common basis of maintaining colonial interests, to exchange for the help of Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada in obstructing the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and Penghu, dividing China's territory, creating so-called "two Chinas," and attempting to drag the Commonwealth countries into a war of aggression against China by escalating war threats. Australia is actively coming forward to serve this conspiracy.

As for the so-called "solving the unsettled status of the coastal islands," if, as Reuters reported on March 31, it refers to the Chiang bandit troops (actually the army controlled by the United States) withdrawing from the coastal islands, then this is to put on a pose to deceive the people of Britain and some Commonwealth countries, in order to make it easier for these Commonwealth countries to participate in the U.S. aggression.

But what use can such cunning tricks be? Taiwan, Penghu, and the coastal islands are all Chinese territory. The United States used force to occupy Taiwan and Penghu, and further encroached upon our country's coastal islands. Now, as long as the United States withdraws all its armed forces from Taiwan, Penghu, the coastal islands, and the Taiwan Strait, then the situation in the Taiwan region can be eased immediately. However, the United States is unwilling to do so. What it wants is entirely a trick. On the one hand, it talks about withdrawing from the coastal islands, and on the other hand, it wants to use greater force, including the force of Britain and some other Commonwealth countries, to occupy Taiwan and Penghu for a long time. Its purpose is to try to force the Chinese people to tolerate its occupation of Taiwan and Penghu, and to tolerate its creation of the so-called "two Chinas" from these two aspects.

This conspiracy is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people and cannot be approved by any country that claims to be willing to have peace and willing to respect the territorial sovereignty of other countries.

However, there are now signs that Britain and some Commonwealth countries are far from uninterested in the U.S. conspiracy to escalate the threat of war against the Chinese people to force the Chinese people to tolerate U.S. occupation of Taiwan. Reuters reported on March 31 that the Commonwealth countries have indicated that as long as the Chiang bandit troops withdraw from Kinmen and Matsu, they can "firmly express their determination to support" the U.S. action to occupy Taiwan. Regarding this point, Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson hinted in a speech on March 14 that even if the Commonwealth countries cannot take action through the United Nations, they can assist the United States through the relationship of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. At the same time, the British bourgeois newspapers are also propagandizing for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. For example, "The Times" published a statement by the Chiang bandit answering its reporter on March 16, and then promoted on March 21 that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique "has completely grasped the situation." The British propaganda machine also deliberately spread the atmosphere that the Chinese people may have changed their minds about liberating Taiwan. It is not difficult to see that this kind of public opinion preparation is closely related to the U.S. conspiracy to have Britain assist it in occupying Taiwan and escalating the threat of war.

It is precisely because the U.S. conspiracy to escalate the threat of war has received a positive response from Britain and some Commonwealth countries that the U.S. aggressive bloc is even more frantically preparing to expand the war and making war provocations to cooperate with the implementation of this conspiracy. Military consultations between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique are being conducted frequently. Belligerents like U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Carney are trying their best to incite war hysteria and spread the atmosphere that a major war is about to break out. U.S. aircraft intruding into our country's airspace is an attempt to strengthen this war threat to the Chinese people.

However, the U.S. aggressive bloc has never been able to scare the Chinese people, and now its method of escalating the threat of war will certainly not achieve this goal. If the United States, which claims to be the hegemon of the capitalist world, cannot scare the Chinese people, then adding Britain and some Commonwealth countries will also be of no avail. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands. It is absolutely impossible to want the Chinese people to tolerate U.S. aggression and to tolerate U.S. dividing China's territory.

    绝对办不到
    蒋元椿
    美国军用飞机在四月一日连续侵犯我国山东和广东领空，进行武装挑衅。这种行动是美国侵略集团近来正在策划的用扩大战争威胁来阻挠中国人民解放台湾的阴谋的一部分。
    根据西方消息，曼谷会议以后，三月中旬，美国和澳大利亚之间在华盛顿举行了秘密会谈，拟订了一个所谓“解决”台湾问题的秘密计划。在会谈期间，杜勒斯并特地到加拿大去同加拿大政府进行会商。事后，这个计划并在英联邦国家中进行了讨论。
    从英国“外事报道”杂志三月二十四日的报道中，人们接触到了美、澳计划的一部分内容。看来美国想和由澳大利亚出面的一些英联邦国家拿中国的领土作一桩丑恶买卖。这个计划的意思是：如果中国人民解放台湾，澳大利亚将协助美国进攻中国，条件是“首先要解决沿海岛屿的未定地位问题”。同时，美国还“将考虑在保卫新加坡和马来亚联邦的事业中承担比它已经根据马尼拉条约所承担的义务更强烈的义务”。路透社在三月二十日报道说，这个计划的目的就是要制造“两个中国”的既成事实。
    这些消息表露得很明显。美国深知它强占中国领土台湾、澎湖和沿海岛屿极其不得人心，它的地位很是孤立。因此，它想在维护殖民利益的共同基础上，寻找办法来换取英国、澳大利亚、新西兰和加拿大帮它用扩大战争威胁来阻挠中国人民解放台湾、澎湖，割裂中国的领土，制造所谓“两个中国”，并企图把英联邦国家一起拖进侵略中国的战争。澳大利亚则正在积极出面替这个阴谋服务。
    至于所谓“解决沿海岛屿的未定地位问题”，假如像路透社三月三十一日所报道的是指蒋贼军
  （实即美国所控制的军队）从沿海岛屿撤走，那末，这就是想装出一种姿态来欺骗英国和某些英联邦国家的人民，为了更便于这些英联邦国家参加美国的侵略行动。
    可是这种奸诈的伎俩又能有什么用处呢？台湾、澎湖和沿海岛屿都是中国的领土。美国使用武力侵占台湾澎湖，又得寸进尺地侵占我国的沿海岛屿。现在，只要美国从台湾、澎湖、沿海岛屿和台湾海峡撤走它的一切武装力量，那么，台湾地区的局势立刻就能够缓和。但是，美国却并不肯这样做。它要的完全是一种诡计。它一方面讲什么从沿海岛屿撤走，另一方面却要使用更大的武力，包括英国和另外一些英联邦国家的武力来长期霸占台湾和澎湖。它的目的就是企图从这样两个方面来迫使中国人民容忍它侵占台湾澎湖，容忍它制造所谓“两个中国”。
    这种阴谋是中国人民绝对不能容许的，是任何自称为愿意和平、愿意尊重别国领土主权的国家所不能赞同的。
    然而，现在有迹象表明：英国和有些英联邦国家对于美国这个企图扩大对中国人民的战争威胁来强迫中国人民容忍美国侵占台湾的阴谋，远不是不感兴趣。路透社在三月三十一日报道说，英联邦国家已经表示，只要蒋贼军撤出金门、马祖，它们将可以“坚决表示它们决心支持”美国侵占台湾的行动。关于这一点，加拿大外交部长皮尔逊在三月十四日发表的演说中曾经暗示，英联邦国家即使不能通过联合国来采取行动，也可以通过北大西洋公约集团的关系来协助美国。同时，英国的资产阶级报纸也正在为蒋介石卖国集团进行宣传。例如“泰晤士报”在三月十六日刊载了蒋贼答它的记者的一个声明，接着又在三月二十一日宣传蒋介石卖国集团
  “已经完全掌握了局势”。英国的宣传机器并且故意散布空气说，中国人民可能已经改变了解放台湾的主意。不难看出，这种舆论准备和美国要英国协助它侵占台湾、扩大战争威胁的阴谋有着密切的关联。
    正是由于美国的扩大战争威胁的阴谋得到了英国和某些英联邦国家的积极反应，美国侵略集团正在更加疯狂地进行扩大战争的准备和战争挑衅，来配合这个阴谋的进行。美国和蒋介石卖国集团之间的军事上的商谈正在频繁地进行。美国海军作战部长卡涅之流的好战分子竭力煽动战争歇斯底里，散布大战即将爆发的空气。美国飞机侵入我国领空，就是企图加强这种对中国人民的战争威胁。
    但是，美国侵略集团从来也不能够吓倒中国人民，现在它的扩大战争威胁的办法也一定不能达到这个目的。如果自命为资本主义世界霸主的美国还吓不倒中国人民，那末就是加上英国和某些英联邦国家也同样无济于事。中国人民一定要解放台湾和沿海岛屿。要想中国人民容忍美国侵略，容忍美国割裂中国领土是绝对办不到的。
