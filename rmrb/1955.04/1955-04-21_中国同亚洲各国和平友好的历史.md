    China's History of Peaceful and Friendly Relations with Asian Countries
    Zhou Yiliang
    Asian people recently held a historically significant grand gathering—the Asian Countries Conference; following that, government representatives from twenty-nine countries across Asia and Africa are holding an unprecedentedly important Asian-African Conference, seeking to further strengthen the peaceful and friendly cooperative relations between the people of Asia and between the countries of Asia and Africa. It is clear that as long as the people of all participating countries unite and persist in defending peace, all the conspiracies of imperialism to maintain and expand colonial rule are bound to fail.
    The Chinese people are peace-loving. Since the founding of the new China, it has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy, striving to develop friendly and cooperative relations with all countries, especially with Asian countries. Historically, China has always maintained peaceful and friendly relations with Asian countries. It has never had any conflicts with African countries. Although individual feudal rulers in our history launched wars against certain Asian countries, the traces left by the friendship between China and Asian countries, and the economic and cultural exchanges and influences over the past two thousand years are much deeper and have a much wider impact than those wars. Today, looking back at China's past peaceful and friendly relations with Asian countries is of great significance for promoting the close unity between our country and Asian and African countries.
    Korea, Mongolia, and Vietnam are three Asian countries bordering China. Mongolia has deep historical ties with China, and Korea and Vietnam have had contact with China as far back as over two thousand years ago. Chinese immigrants, merchants, and artisans brought Chinese culture and technology to Korea, and Korean immigrants, students, monks, and merchants transmitted the cultural achievements of the Korean people to China. Things as old as bronze movable type printing and as recent as rice cultivation in the Northeast are symbols of Sino-Korean friendship. Since the Han Dynasty, Vietnam has absorbed Chinese production technology and has been deeply influenced by Chinese culture. Even today, many Chinese words are preserved in the Mongolian language, and both Korea and Vietnam once used Chinese characters as a tool for expression and recording. As early as the Tang Dynasty, Korean people lived and worked in peace and contentment in China, and in the late nineteenth century, Korean immigrants were an important force in developing Northeast China. Many Koreans held various official positions in China during the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, leaving their names in Chinese history. During the early Ming Dynasty, the planning and management of the construction of the city walls and palaces of today's Beijing, as well as the later reconstruction of the Three Great Halls, were greatly influenced by the Annamese (Vietnamese) Nguyen An. China and Korea and Vietnam have also fought side by side against common enemies. In the Ming Dynasty, Li Rusong helped Korea repel Hideyoshi Toyotomi's invasion, and in the Qing Dynasty, Liu Yongfu cooperated with Vietnam to resist French imperialism. In modern history, the great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has pushed the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people to a new stage of internationalism.
    Other Asian countries neighboring China include Japan, Burma, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand. China has historically maintained varying degrees of contact with these countries as well. As far as Japan is concerned, Japan's early contact with China greatly promoted the development of their society and economy. Tang Dynasty China became a model for Japan in politics, economy, and culture. The influence of Chinese culture is still preserved in Japan's language, writing, religion, thought, art, and even customs. Until the Meiji Restoration, trade and cultural exchange between the people of China and Japan had never been interrupted. Even during Japan's period of "seclusion," Chinese merchants were specially allowed to trade in Nagasaki. After the Meiji Restoration, due to the development of the Japanese economy, Sino-Japanese trade relations became closer. On the Chinese side, some enlightenment thinkers studied in Japan, accepted advanced Western European ideas, and played a certain progressive role in China's social development. Only the invasion of China by Japanese imperialist elements in the past sixty years has prevented the Chinese and Japanese people from developing normal economic and cultural exchanges, interrupting the two thousand years of traditional friendship between China and Japan. Today, U.S. imperialism is exerting pressure to prevent the Japanese people from restoring normal trade relations with China. We must work with the Japanese people to break down this artificial barrier so that the people of China and Japan can return to the path of developing peaceful and friendly relations under new historical conditions.
    Although Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos are quite different from China in terms of customs, language, writing, and religious beliefs, we have always maintained friendly cultural and economic cooperation in history.
    When Zhang Qian was on a mission to Central Asia in the Western Han Dynasty, he saw "Shu cloth" and "Qiong bamboo staffs" exported from India to Central Asia. At that time, products from the southwestern regions were able to enter India, most likely through today's Burma. In the first century AD, the king within the borders of Burma had already established friendly relations with China. During the Tang Dynasty, Burma (then known as the Pyu Kingdom) sent the king's son with thirty-five musicians and twelve kinds of musical pieces to China. Pyu music and dance became the subject of the poet Bai Juyi's description, and the New Book of Tang contains a very detailed record of Pyu music and dance. Yunnan borders Burma and has been culturally influenced by each other. Nanzhao, which was established in Yunnan during the Tang Dynasty, imported Esoteric Buddhism from Burma; more than 3,000 Pyu people lived in Tuodong City (Kunming) in Nanzhao. Both Chinese and Burmese are branches of the Sino-Tibetan language family. Nanzhao and Burma also have similarities in customs. For example, the kings of Nanzhao and the ancient residents of Yunnan often had names linked from father to son, with the first character of the son's name being the last character of the father's name, and the same situation occurred in Burmese history. The economic ties between southwestern China and Burma have never been interrupted since the Tang Dynasty. Ancient products imported from Burma to China included "white cotton," cotton cloth, glass utensils, etc. In modern times, Burma mainly imported cotton yarn, cotton, and salt to China. Burmese jade and gemstones were especially welcomed by China. What China imported to Burma was mainly silk brocade. In the eighteenth century, merchant caravans often used three or four hundred cattle, or even as many as two thousand horses, to transport goods to Burma at one time. Until the War of Resistance Against Japan, Yunnan exported a large amount of yellow silk and woven products to Burma, and Burmese women's "sarongs" were often made of Chinese silk. In the early Qing Dynasty, no less than a thousand merchants went to Burma every year, often bringing hundreds of copper gongs and iron pots to Burma for sale, supplying Burma with the copper and iron utensils it lacked. Chinese scissors and sewing needles were also a major commodity imported into Burma. China and Burma have always complemented each other in trade in this way.
    At the end of the thirteenth century, Siam had repeatedly established friendly relations with China. Siam once recruited pottery workers in China, and therefore, Chinese pottery technology was transmitted to Siam. In the late fourteenth century, Siam and the southern Luohu Kingdom merged and became Siam (Thailand), continuing to interact with the Ming Dynasty. At that time, Siam had the closest relationship with China. When the Ming Dynasty sent troops to assist Korea in resisting Hideyoshi Toyotomi, Siam "asked to secretly send troops to directly attack Japan, distracting them from the rear" ("History of the Ming Dynasty," Volume 324). The peaceful and friendly relations between China and Siam can also be proven by the following two things. The first is the activities of Chinese people in Siam. In the late fifteenth century, Xie Wenbin from Tingzhou drifted to Siam and became prime minister. In the seventeenth century, some important positions in the Siamese royal court were held by Chinese people. In the eighteenth century, after the Siamese capital was destroyed by the Burmese army, Zheng Xin, who repelled the Burmese army, restored the regime, and established the Bangkok Dynasty, came from a family of overseas Chinese who married Siamese women. After the eighteenth century, trade between China and Siam was extremely prosperous, with fifty or sixty ships from Shanghai, Ningbo, Quanzhou, Xiamen, and Chaozhou going to Siam every year. In addition to goods, many immigrants were also carried, most of whom were from Chaozhou. In addition to doing business, many Chinese in Siam were engaged in planting rice, sugar cane, tobacco, and cotton. According to records, there were four to five thousand overseas Chinese in Siam at the end of the seventeenth century, reaching 700,000 by the beginning of the nineteenth century, and it was estimated at that time that the number of overseas Chinese in Bangkok was almost equal to the number of Siamese people. The fact that so many overseas Chinese were able to live and work in peace and contentment in Siam for a long time fully demonstrates the peaceful and friendly relations between the two countries. Second, Siam has also made economic contributions to China. In the early eighteenth century, Siamese rice began to be imported into China. Emperor Kangxi issued an edict to the Ministry of Rites, agreeing with the Siamese envoys to transport 300,000 shi of rice to Fujian, Guangdong, and Ningbo every year, exempting them from taxes. Later, incentive measures were formulated, and Siamese merchants who transported rice to Fujian and Guangdong provinces for trade were exempted from 50% of the ship tax for every 10,000 shi or more, and 30% for 5,000 shi or more. If there was too much rice among the people and it could not be sold, the government would buy it. During the Qianlong period, Chinese merchants were also encouraged to transport rice to Siam. In 1855, Britain signed an unequal treaty with Siam, and later, other European powers continued to sign various unequal treaties with Siam. As a result, Sino-Siamese trade was hit, and the number of merchant ships to China plummeted from 400 to less than 100 per year. The overseas Chinese in Siam were also often persecuted due to the instigation of imperialists. Today, the people of Asia must unite closely. Only by completely eliminating colonialism can the people of the two countries live together in closer friendship.
    During the Three Kingdoms period, Sun Wu sent Kang Tai and Zhu Ying to the Kingdom of Funan (in today's Cambodia). At that time, due to the suggestions of Kang Tai and Zhu Ying, the customs of Funan, such as clothing, underwent great changes. The people of Laos (anciently known as Nan Zhao) also learned to make wine and raise silkworms from the Chinese. The Southern Dynasties and the Tang Dynasty all had exchanges with Funan. Later, Funan's subordinate state, Zhenla, annexed Funan; after the sixteenth century, Zhenla was renamed Cambodia. The Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties all traded with Zhenla. The goods supplied by Zhenla to China were mainly ivory, spices, beeswax, raw silk, etc.; according to Yuan people's records at the end of the thirteenth century, the goods that China supplied to Zhenla were extremely wide-ranging. Because the area did not produce gold and silver, they cherished Chinese gold and silver very much. They also cherished Chinese colored silk fabrics very much. In addition, "such as tin-lead from Zhenzhou, lacquer plates from Wenzhou, celadon from Quanzhou, as well as mercury, vermilion, paper, sulfur, saltpeter, sandalwood, angelica, musk, hemp cloth, yellow grass cloth, umbrellas, iron pots, copper plates, water beads, tung oil, combs, wooden combs, and needles. The heavier goods such as mats from Mingzhou" (Yuan, Zhou Daguan: "Customs of Zhenla"), were all very popular in Zhenla. At that time, so many daily necessities in the lives of the people of Zhenla came from China, which shows the close economic ties. In the early seventeenth century, Ming people recorded that Zhenla had places where Chinese people lived, with wood used as a city. Chinese merchants had a very good reputation for business and were welcomed by the locals, "calling them Buddha, and prostrating themselves on the ground and worshiping when they saw them" (Ibid.). Trade exchanges and peaceful and friendly relations are precisely what China has always strived to maintain and develop with all countries in Asia.
    Indonesia, the country where the Asian-African Conference is held, has an even longer and deeper friendship with China. As early as the beginning of the second century AD, the king of Ye Diao on the island of Java had already sent envoys to establish friendly relations with the Han court. Fragments of pottery from the Han Dynasty have been excavated on major islands in Indonesia, such as western Java, southern Sumatra, and eastern Kalimantan (formerly known as Borneo). These underground objects prove that the contact between the two countries at that time was not limited to the "tributary" relationship between rulers, and Chinese pottery may have become a daily necessity for the Indonesian people. Indonesia is located on the main sea route from ancient China to India, and therefore became a relay point for transportation between China and India. Monks from the Eastern Jin, Southern Dynasties, and Tang Dynasty who took the sea route to India to seek scriptures and ask for Buddhist teachings often visited the islands of Indonesia on the way. In the early fifth century, the famous Faxian encountered a strong wind on his way back to China from Ceylon and drifted to Java. After staying for five months, Javanese merchant ships trading with China brought Faxian and the Buddhist scriptures and statues he had obtained in India back to China. Yijing, who returned from seeking scriptures in India in the seventh century, lived in the Kingdom of Srivijaya on the island of Sumatra for more than ten years. Due to the prosperity of Buddhism in Srivijaya, Yijing even advocated that Chinese monks should first go to the countries on the islands of Indonesia to study Buddhism before going to India. Yijing's writings are important works for studying ancient Buddhism in Indonesia today.
    After the Tang and Song Dynasties, trade between China and Southeast Asia continued to develop. Foreign merchants were invited to China, and merchant ships were sent to Southeast Asia. At the end of the twelfth century, there were relatively detailed records of Southeast Asian countries, and Song Dynasty porcelain has also been excavated in the Philippines, which shows the frequency and breadth of trade at that time. In addition, the records also describe that Chinese merchants traded in Southeast Asia in a harmonious and friendly manner. For example, when a ship arrived in Brunei (Borneo), the merchants would first offer Chinese food to the king after landing, entertaining each other, and then look at the goods and set prices after more than a month; "after the price is set, drums are sounded to summon people from near and far to listen to the trade" (Song, Zhao Rugua: "Description of Various Foreign Lands," Volume 1). When Chinese merchant ships left, the king would see them off. In the twelfth century, some Chinese merchants had already stayed and did not return. In the first half of the fifteenth century, "Eunuch Sanbao" Zheng He made seven voyages to the "Western Seas," each time leading a "treasure ship" fleet composed of 27,000 to 28,000 people, carrying a large number of Chinese silks, porcelain, musk, and copper coins, etc., to trade with various countries. The "treasure ships" traveled to more than 30 countries, from the Indochina Peninsula in the east to the east coast of Africa in the west, among which the countries on the Malay and Indonesian archipelagos were important locations in several overseas trade voyages. At that time, China's prestige was very strong, and its military strength was also strong, but Zheng He mainly sought peaceful trade with various countries, rather than relying on the military power of a large country to plunder and rob. In conducting trade, he observed the customs of various countries, and sometimes agreed on prices by clapping hands, "whether expensive or cheap, there is no regret" (Ma Huan: "Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores"). The Kingdom of Malacca in Malaya was strategically located, so Zheng He's "treasure ship" used this place as the center, building warehouses to store goods and grain, and the ships going to various countries gathered here before returning to China together. These were all supported by the King of Malacca. The King of Malacca came to China five times in ten years to pay homage, once leading "wives and retainers" of more than 540 people to come together. Kings from islands such as Sulu, Kalimantan, and the Philippines also made similar friendly expressions. These examples could only happen in a situation of very friendly relations.
    Since the fifteenth century, the peaceful and friendly relations between China and the Indonesian archipelago, Malaya, and the Philippines, in addition to trade, have also been manifested in the activities of the Chinese people in these regions. They helped develop these regions and introduced Chinese agricultural production tools and agricultural products. Under the occupation of Western colonialists, overseas Chinese also joined the local people in the struggle against cruel colonial rule. When Zheng He went to the "Western Seas," people from Guangdong and Zhangzhou and Quanzhou were already living in Java. For example, Xincun was originally a beach, but after the Chinese established a residence, the population reached more than a thousand households. Later immigrants continued to arrive. By the nineteenth century, the plows used in Kalimantan and the Philippines were still in the Chinese style, obviously transmitted by overseas Chinese. In the early seventeenth century, Dutch colonists invaded Java, relying on the hard work of many overseas Chinese to build the city of Batavia (now Jakarta). Overseas Chinese operated the first batch of sugarcane plantations and sugar refineries near Batavia. However, their hard work enabled the Dutch colonists to obtain huge profits. The Dutch colonists once admitted that without the Chinese, this heart of their colonial rule in the East could not exist. Before the arrival of European colonists, Chinese people were also engaged in development in Malaya and the Philippines. Taking Malaya as an example, Chinese people had long risked their lives there to clear forests, open roads, operate regular voyages between the ports of the peninsula, mine tin, etc. The British colonial rulers also forced overseas Chinese to participate in building railways and bridges. The British Governor of Singapore once publicly declared that nine-tenths of the colonial government's revenue came from overseas Chinese. Under the rule of European colonialists, overseas Chinese, like the people of these countries, suffered cruel oppression and exploitation. Their fates were so closely linked. At the same time, the friendship between the people of these countries and the Chinese people was consolidated in the hard work of jointly developing these regions and in the struggle against colonialism.
    Overseas Chinese have constantly resisted the cruel oppression and exploitation of European colonialists in Indonesia, the Philippines, and other places. For example, in 1593, the Spanish Governor of the Philippines forcibly conscripted 1,400 Filipinos and 250 overseas Chinese to form a fleet to compete with Dutch colonists for the spice-producing islands of Indonesia. The Spanish colonists "rested on the boats, making the Chinese row day and night. If they were slightly tired, they would be whipped, or stabbed to death, suffering all kinds of bitterness" (Ming, Zhang Xie: "Study of the Eastern and Western Oceans," Volume 5). The overseas Chinese sailors Pan He and Wu Deng discussed: "It is the same to rebel and die, to be whipped to death, or stabbed to death. Otherwise, we will also die in battle, it is better to kill the chiefs to vent our anger" (Ibid.). So they rose up in revolt, killed the Spanish officials below the governor, and shattered their looting plan. In 1740, overseas Chinese in Batavia resisted the tyrannical actions of the Dutch colonists and launched an armed uprising. Overseas Chinese in various parts of Java responded, and the Javanese people also participated and actively cooperated. Some local feudal lords also supported their struggle against Dutch colonial rule under the influence of the joint uprising of overseas Chinese and the Javanese people. This uprising dealt a great blow to the Dutch East India Company. In the early days of the Western colonialists' invasion of Asia, the Chinese people and the people of Asian countries had already worked together in this way, supporting each other to carry out the struggle of resistance.
    China's friendly relations with India, Pakistan, and Ceylon can be said to be long-standing and deeply rooted. Nearly two thousand years ago, Indian Buddhism began to spread to China. From the Han Dynasty to the Song Dynasty, many Indian monks came to China to preach. More Chinese monks, unafraid of hardship, traveled long distances to the "Western Paradise" and the Lion Kingdom (Ceylon) to obtain scriptures and seek Buddhist teachings. The thousands of volumes of Buddhist scriptures they translated have mostly been lost in India and are treasures for studying ancient Indian culture today. Faxian, Xuanzang, and Yijing's records of India have preserved valuable information for Indian history. Here, we should especially mention the travelogue of the Silla (Korean) monk Huichao, who traveled to India in the eighth century. He came to the Tang Dynasty to study, and then went to India via Central Asia. He traveled west for ten years, and after returning to the Tang Dynasty, he spent his remaining years on Mount Wutai. Huichao's travelogue written in Chinese is not only an important material for us to study Indian history today, but also a valuable memorial in the history of friendly relations between China, India, and Korea. Sino-Indian cultural relations are embodied in art, such as the stone Buddhas of Yungang and the murals of Dunhuang, which are well known to us. Some Indian folk tales and fables preserved in Buddhist scriptures are often loved by the Chinese people and widely circulated. Indian culture and art, through the medium of China, spread eastward to Korea and Japan. Nepal, located between China and India, has been on friendly terms with China since the seventh century. In the thirteenth century, the famous Nepalese craftsman Arniko came to China. He was good at painting, sculpture, and gold casting. At that time, most of the Buddhist statues in Beijing temples were made by him. Nepal has particularly close economic ties with the Tibetan region, and the making of statues and decorations in Tibetan Buddhist temples also relies heavily on Nepalese craftsmen.
    In terms of trade and exchange of goods, China and India have maintained a long-standing and close relationship. Bengal, the eastern and western coasts of southern India, and the island of Ceylon were all areas visited by Chinese merchant ships in the past. According to Marco Polo, ships from all over the world came to the southwestern coast of India to trade, and Chinese ships were the most numerous. Indian merchant ships also loaded pepper, spices, and various precious goods to trade in Quanzhou. According to the records of a fourteenth-century Arab traveler, transportation between India and China at that time mainly relied on Chinese ships; the large ships had four decks and could carry a thousand people, with many rooms; most Chinese merchants booked round-trip cabins, which were extremely crowded, which shows the grandeur of the situation. Hou Xian and Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty both visited southern India and Ceylon. The Sanskrit word for peach is "Han Chi Lai," and the word for pear is "Han Wangzi," which shows that these fruits came from China. The Sanskrit names for steel, red lead, a certain kind of gourd, and camphor are all prefixed with Chinese characters, which also suggests their origin. At the end of the seventh century, the word "paper" already existed in Sanskrit, which was probably introduced to India by land through Central Asia. From the end of the eleventh century, the use of paper for writing gradually became common in India. By the beginning of the fifteenth century, paper was made from tree bark in Bengal. At that time, the Chinese described the white paper of India as "smooth and delicate, like deerskin" (Ma Huan: "Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores"). These are all contributions of China to India in daily life. In China, pepper, jasmine, etc. were transplanted from India, and the method of making sugar was also introduced from India. Previously, China only knew how to make rock sugar, and only in the early seventh century did the envoy from the Kingdom of Magadha in northern India bring the method of squeezing sugarcane juice to boil into sugar. Relations between China and India in all aspects are extremely long-standing and close. Especially in such a long historical period and such a long border line, China and India have never had a war, which is rare in world history.
    Although the countries of West Asia are relatively far from China, these countries have also had quite close relations with China in history. Only the entry of Western colonialist aggressive forces into Asia in modern times has hindered the development of traditional friendship between China and these countries. To the west of India is Afghanistan, when it established the first independent Ghaznavid dynasty, Emperor Shengzong of Liao and the Uyghur Khan of Xizhou in Gaochang jointly sent envoys, carrying gifts, and using arrows as a letter, to meet the famous Sultan Mahmud in Afghan history, requesting friendly relations. Shengzong's letter praised Mahmud, saying: "I have long heard of your heroic and outstanding qualities, and your skillful control. The country is peaceful, and the frontier towns are subdued." (See the Arab Mawardi: "Records on China, Turkey, and India," English translation). Although the people of the Southern Song Dynasty had no direct contact with Afghanistan, the books of the time also contained records of the "Ghaznavid Kingdom" and the king's bravery and good fighting. As for Iran to the west, its relationship with China is even closer. In the first century AD, Ban Chao's subordinates had already visited the Parthian Empire within the then Iranian territory, and later, Prince An Shigao of Parthia came to China to promote Buddhism and was the first person who can be verified to have translated Buddhist scriptures in Chinese Buddhist history. After the Northern and Southern Dynasties, Persia always maintained friendly relations with China. During the Tang Dynasty, a large number of Persian merchants traveled to Yangzhou and Guangzhou, setting up "Persian Shops" to trade in jewelry and spices. Chinese merchant ships also often docked at the ports on the Persian Gulf. Plants such as pomegranates, sesame, walnuts, and spinach were introduced from Persia, and silk, paper, rhubarb, and coptis were introduced from China to Persia. Some Persian merchants stayed in China for a long time, such as Li Xun, a "native Persian" at the end of the Tang Dynasty, was good at writing lyrics, and his lyrics were recited and included in the "Collection from Among the Flowers" along with the works of Chinese lyricists. Zoroastrianism from Persia and Manichaeism originating in Persia were successively introduced into China. Zoroastrianism was mainly believed by Persian and Central Asian merchants, and Zoroastrian temples were established in both Chang'an and Luoyang, the two capitals of the Tang Dynasty. Manichaeism was mainly believed by the Uyghurs in the Tang Dynasty, but later it became widely circulated in both the north and south of China.
    The historical friendship between China and Arab countries is also very profound. Before Islam entered Syria, Nestorianism (a branch of Christianity) created by Syrians was introduced into China during the Tang Dynasty, was protected by the government, and temples were built to ordain monks. Today, the "Nestorian Stele in China" built at that time is still preserved in Xi'an, with the names of the Nestorian elders who came from the east engraved on it in Syriac. Arabia (then known as Dashi) officially communicated with China in the mid-seventh century. From the early eighth century to the end of the fifteenth century, whether it was the Han Chinese regime of the Two Songs or the Khitan and Mongol regimes, they maintained very close trade relations with Arabia. Guangzhou, Quanzhou, Yangzhou, and other states were ports frequently visited by Arab merchants. They generally transported spices, medicinal materials, rhinoceros horns, elephant tusks, jewelry to China, and then bought silk, porcelain, etc. to take back. Zheng He's voyages to the "Western Seas" took him to Aden and Zafar on the Arabian Peninsula, and his subordinates also paid homage to the Kaaba. Cultural exchanges between China and Arabia have had a profound impact on both countries. Islam was introduced from Arabia to China, and Arab medicine and the calendar made important contributions to Chinese culture. China's papermaking, printing, compass, and gunpowder were first introduced westward to Arab countries, and then to Europe through the Arabs. In the eighth century, the Samarkand under Arab rule established the earliest papermaking industry in West Asia, and the saltpeter necessary for making gunpowder was called "Chinese snow" by the Arabs. During the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, Arabs stayed in China and did not return. Li Yansheng, who passed the imperial examination in the Tang Dynasty, Pu Shougeng, who managed the shipping trade at the end of the Song Dynasty, and many Arabs who served in China in the Yuan Dynasty. Whether in terms of people's exchanges, cultural influence, or commercial transactions, China and Arab countries have a long tradition, which is worthy of our promotion and development.
    Since the founding of the new China, peaceful trade and cultural exchanges with Asian countries have been developing day by day; and peaceful friendship with African countries has also been increasing day by day. Reviewing the friendly relations between China and Asian countries for two thousand years will enhance our confidence in promoting peaceful and friendly cooperation in the Asian and African regions. This will be an important guarantee of world peace.

    中国同亚洲各国和平友好的历史
    周一良
    亚洲人民最近举行了富有历史意义的重大集会——亚洲国家会议；接着，亚非两洲二十九个国家的政府代表正在举行空前重大的亚非会议，谋求进一步地加强亚洲人民之间和亚非各国之间的和平友好合作的关系。很明显，只要参加会议的各国人民团结一致，坚持保卫和平，那么，力图保持和扩大殖民统治的帝国主义的一切阴谋就一定要失败。
    中国人民是热爱和平的。新中国建国以来，一贯执行和平外交政策，努力发展同各国，尤其是同亚洲国家之间的友好合作关系。从历史上看来，中国从来就是同亚洲国家保持和平友好关系的。对非洲各国更是从来没有什么冲突的。虽然我们的历史上也有个别封建统治者，发动过对于亚洲某些国家的战争；但是比起那些战争来，两千年来中国同亚洲各国之间的友谊关系，经济和文化上的相互交流影响，所遗留下来的痕迹要深刻得多，所发生的作用要广泛得多。今天回顾一下过去中国同亚洲国家之间的和平友好关系，对于促进我国和亚非各国的紧密团结，是有重大的意义的。
    朝鲜、蒙古和越南是同中国接壤的三个亚洲国家。蒙古同中国历史上的关系很深，朝鲜和越南同中国也都远在两千多年以前就有来往。中国的移民、商人和工匠把中国的文化和技术带到朝鲜，朝鲜的移民、学生、僧侣和商人又把朝鲜人民的文化成就传到中国。远之如铜活字印刷术，近之如东北的水稻种植，都是中朝友谊的标志。自从两汉以来，越南即吸取中国生产技术，在文化上也深受中国影响。蒙古语里至今还保存不少汉语词汇，朝鲜和越南也都曾用汉文作为表达和记录的工具。早在唐代，就有朝鲜人民在中国安居乐业，十九世纪后期朝鲜的移民更是开发我国东北的重要力量。不少朝鲜人在唐、宋、元时代的中国担任各种官职，在中国历史上留下了名字。明初修建今天北京的城池宫殿，以及后来重建三殿，安南人阮安的规画经营起了很大作用。中国同朝鲜、越南还曾经并肩作战，打击过共同的敌人。明代李如松帮助朝鲜打退了丰臣秀吉的入侵，清代刘永福协同越南抗击了法帝国主义。在现代史上，伟大的抗美援朝斗争更把中朝人民的友谊推进到新的国际主义的阶段。
    同中国邻近的亚洲国家，还有日本、缅甸、老挝、柬埔寨和泰国。中国同这些国家在历史上同样地保持着不同程度的联系。就日本来说，日本早期同中国的接触，大大促进了他们社会经济的发展。唐代的中国成为日本政治、经济和文化各方面的典范。中国文化的影响，到今天还保存在日本的语言、文字、宗教、思想、艺术以至于风俗习惯里。直到明治维新，中日两国人民之间贸易上的来往和文化上的交流都从未断绝。即使在日本闭关“锁国”时期，中国商人也是得到特别允许能到长崎贸易的。明治以后，由于日本经济的发展，中日的贸易关系更加密切起来。而在中国方面，有些启蒙运动者们在日本留学，接受了西欧的先进思想，对中国的社会发展，也起了一定的进步作用。只是六十年来日本帝国主义分子对中国进行侵略，使中日人民不能正常地发展经济和文化的交流，打断了两千年来中日两国传统的友谊。今天，美帝国主义又在施加压力，阻挠日本人民同中国恢复正常贸易关系。我们要同日本人民一起打破这种人为障碍，使中日两国人民在新的历史条件之下，重新走上发展和平友好关系的道路。
    缅甸、泰国、柬埔寨和老挝虽然同中国在风俗习惯、语言文字、宗教信仰方面都相去较远，但是我们在历史上也始终保持着文化上和经济上的友好合作。
    西汉时张骞出使中亚，曾看见由印度输出到中亚的“蜀布”和“邛竹杖”。西南地方的物产当时得以进入印度，很可能是通过今天的缅甸。公元一世纪时，缅甸境内国王已同中国通好。唐代缅甸（当时称为骠国）派国王的儿子送乐工三十五人和乐曲十二种到中国来，骠国的乐舞成为诗人白居易描写的题材，新唐书里关于骠国的乐曲和舞蹈也有很详细的记载。云南同缅甸邻接，文化上相互影响。唐代建国于云南的南诏，从缅甸输入佛教密宗；南诏的拓东城（昆明）有骠国人民三千多人居住。汉语和缅语都是汉藏语系的分支。南诏同缅甸在习惯上也有类似之处。例如，南诏国王和古代云南居民往往父子连名，儿子名的头一字是父亲名的末一字，而缅甸历史上也有同样情况。中国西南地方同缅甸在经济上的联系自唐以来未曾断绝。古代从缅甸输入中国的产品有“白?”、棉布、琉璃制的器皿等等，近代缅甸输入中国的主要是棉纱、棉花和盐。缅甸的玉和宝石尤其受到中国的欢迎。中国输入缅甸的，主要是丝绸锦绣。在十八世纪时，常常一次入缅的商队使用三四百只牛，甚至多到两千只马，来驮运商品。直到抗日战争之前，云南还对缅甸输出大量黄丝和织造品，缅甸妇女的“纱笼”常常是用中国丝绸来制的。清初每年到缅甸经商的不下千百人，他们常带几百只铜锣铁锅到缅甸贩卖，供给了缅甸所缺乏的铜和铁的用具。中国的剪刀和缝纫的针也曾是输入缅甸的大宗商品。中缅两国自古以来就是这样在贸易上有无相济的。
    十三世纪末期，暹国曾经屡次同中国通好。暹国曾在中国召募陶器工人，因此，中国制陶技术就传到暹国。十四世纪后期，暹国和南部的罗斛国合并，称为暹罗（即泰国），继续同明朝来往。当时，暹罗同中国关系最为密切。明朝出兵援助朝鲜抗击丰臣秀吉时，暹罗曾“请潜师直捣日本，牵其后”
  （“明史”，卷三二四）。中国同暹罗的和平友好关系，又可以从下面两件事得到证明。第一是中国人在暹罗的活动。十五世纪后期，汀州人谢文彬漂流到暹罗，作了宰相。十七世纪，暹罗王廷里也有些重要官职由中国人担任。十八世纪，暹罗首都被缅甸军队破坏以后，击退缅军、恢复政权、建立曼谷王朝的郑信，就是出于华侨同暹罗女子结婚的家庭。十八世纪以后，中国同暹罗之间的贸易极盛，每年有上海、宁波、泉州、厦门和潮州等地船五六十只前往经商。货物之外，也载去不少移民，其中以潮州人最多。中国人在暹罗除作生意之外，还有很多从事种植稻米、甘蔗、烟草和棉花等。据记载，十七世纪末叶暹罗有华侨四五千人，到十九世纪初年达七十万人，当时估计曼谷的华侨数目几同暹罗人相等。这样多的华侨能够长期在暹罗安居乐业，不能不充分说明了两国的和平友好关系。第二，暹罗对于中国在经济上也曾有贡献。十八世纪初年，暹罗米开始输入中国。康熙帝下诏礼部，同暹罗使臣议定，每年运米三十万石到福建、广东和宁波三处，免征捐税。后来，又制定鼓励办法，暹罗商人运米来闽粤诸省贸易，万石以上免收船货税银十分之五，五千石以上免收十分之三。如果民间米多，销售不出，则官家收买。乾隆时又奖励中国商人到暹罗运米。一八五五年，英国同暹罗订立不平等条约，以后，欧洲其他列强又继续同暹罗订立各种不平等条约。这样，中暹的贸易就受到打击，每年到中国的商船由四百只骤减到一百只以下。在暹罗的华侨也由于帝国主义者的挑拨而时常受到迫害。今天，亚洲人民必须紧密团结起来。只有彻底消灭殖民主义，才能使两国人民更加亲密地友好共处。
    三国时代，孙吴曾派遣康泰和朱应泛海到扶南国（在今天柬埔寨境内）。当时由于康泰和朱应的建议，扶南国的习俗，如衣着曾起了很大的改变。老挝（古称南掌）人民制酒和养蚕丝，也是从中国人学习到的。南朝和唐代都同扶南来往。后来，扶南属国真腊吞并扶南；十六世纪以后，真腊又改名柬埔寨。唐、宋、元、明时代，都同真腊互通贸易。真腊供应中国的商品主要是象牙、香料、黄蜡、生丝等；中国供给真腊的商品，据十三世纪末元人记载，范围极为广泛。因为其地不出金银，所以他们非常珍视中国的金银。他们也很珍视中国的五色缣帛。此外，“如真州之锡镴、温州之漆盘、泉州之青磁器，及水银、银朱、纸扎、硫黄、焰硝、檀香、白芷、麝香、麻布、黄草布、雨伞、铁锅、铜盘、水珠、桐油、篦箕、木梳、针。其粗重则如明州之席”（元、周达观：“真腊风土记”），在真腊都很受欢迎。当时，真腊人民生活中这样多的日用品都来自中国，可见经济联系的密切。十七世纪初明人记载，真腊有中国人客寓的地方，以木为城。中国人经商的信用甚好，得到当地人欢迎，
  “呼之为佛，见则伏地顶礼”（同上）。贸易上的交流、和平友好的关系，正是中国对于亚洲所有国家自来就努力保持和发展的。
    亚非会议举行的所在国家印度尼西亚同中国之间，更有着悠久而深厚的友谊关系。早在公元二世纪初，爪哇岛上的叶调国王已经派遣使臣同汉廷通好。在印度尼西亚主要岛屿如爪哇的西部、苏门答腊的南部、加里曼丹（旧名婆罗洲）的东部，都发掘出汉代陶器的残片。这些地下的实物证明，当时两国的接触并不止于统治者的“朝贡”关系，中国的陶器可能已经成为印度尼西亚人民的日用必需品了。印度尼西亚位置在古代中国到印度海路的要道上，因而成了中国同印度交通的中继。东晋南朝和唐代取海路到印度求经问法的僧人，中途往往访问了印度尼西亚诸岛。五世纪初，有名的法显从锡兰回国途中遇大风，就曾漂流到爪哇。停留五个月以后，来中国贸易的爪哇商船把法显和他在印度求得的佛经佛像带回中国。七世纪从印度求经回来的义净，先后在苏门答腊岛上的室利佛逝国居住了十年以上。由于室利佛逝的佛教兴盛，义净甚至主张中国僧人未去印度之前，应该先到印度尼西亚诸岛上的国家研习佛法。义净所写的书，是今天研究印度尼西亚古代佛教的重要著作。
    唐宋以后，中国同南洋一带的贸易继续发展。招徕外国商人来华，也派遣商船到南洋去。十二世纪末的著作里对于南洋诸国已有比较详细的记载，并且，在菲律宾也曾发掘出宋代磁器，这说明当时通商的频繁和广泛。此外，在记载中还描写着中国商人在南洋贸易，都是在和谐友好的情况下进行的。例如，船到渤泥（即婆罗洲），商人登岸后先向国王献中国饮食，互相酬应，月余之后才看货定价；
  “价定然后鸣鼓以召远近之人，听其贸易。”（宋、赵汝适：“诸蕃志”，卷上）中国商船离开时，国王又饯送。十二世纪时，中国商人已有留居不归的。十五世纪前半，“三保太监”郑和七下“西洋”，每次带领由两万七八千人组成的“宝船”舰队，装载大批中国的绸缎、磁器、麝香和铜钱等，到各国进行贸易。“宝船”踪迹所至三十余国，东起印度支那半岛，西到非洲东岸，其中马来亚和印度尼西亚群岛上的各国在几次海外贸易的航行中，都是重要的地点。当时中国声威甚振，兵力也强大，但郑和主要地是寻求和各国之间的和平贸易，而不是倚靠大国兵威去掠夺劫取。在进行贸易中，遵守各国习惯，有时议价拍掌为定，“或贵或贱，再不悔改”（马欢：“瀛涯胜览”）。马来亚的满剌加国位居冲要，所以郑和“宝船”即以此地作为中心，修建仓库储存商品粮食，分别到各国去的船只都在此取齐后，一同回中国。这些都得到满剌加国王的支持。满剌加国王在十年之内五次泛海亲来中国朝见，有一次率领“妻子陪臣”五百四十余人同来。苏禄、加里曼丹和菲律宾等岛上国王也有类似的友好表示。这些事例只是在彼此处在十分友好关系的情况下才能有的。
    十五世纪以来，中国同印度尼西亚群岛、马来亚和菲律宾的和平友好关系，除去贸易之外，还表现于中国人民在上述地区的活动。他们帮助开发了这些地区，输入了中国的农业生产工具和农产物。在西方殖民主义者侵占之下，华侨又同当地人民一道，进行了反对残酷殖民统治的斗争。郑和下“西洋”时，爪哇就有广东和漳州、泉州一带人居留。例如新村一地原是沙滩，中国人创居之后，户口达千余家。以后移民陆续不绝。到十九世纪，加里曼丹和菲律宾等地所用的犁都还是中国样式，显然是由华侨传来。十七世纪初，荷兰殖民者侵入爪哇，倚靠许多华侨的血汗劳动，建立起巴达维亚城（即今雅加达）。华侨在巴达维亚附近经营了第一批甘蔗种植园和制糖坊。但是，他们的辛勤劳动，使荷兰殖民者获得巨利。荷兰殖民者曾经供认：离开了中国人，他们在东方殖民统治的这个心脏便不能存在。马来亚和菲律宾在欧洲殖民者未到之前，也都有中国人在经营开发。以马来亚来说，中国人早已在那里冒生命危险清除森林，开辟道路，经营半岛上各港口之间的定期航行，开采锡矿等等。英国殖民统治者修铁路筑桥梁等，也都迫令华侨参加。新嘉坡的英国总督曾公开宣称：殖民政府收入十分之九都来自华侨。在欧洲殖民者的统治下，华侨同这些国家的人民一样，遭受着残酷的压迫和剥削。他们的命运就是这样紧密地相联系着的。同时，这些国家的人民同中国人民的友谊也就在共同开发这些地区的血汗劳动和反对殖民主义的斗争中巩固起来。
    对于欧洲殖民者在印度尼西亚、菲律宾等地残酷的压迫和榨取，华侨曾不断地进行过反抗。例如，一五九三年，菲律宾的西班牙总督强征了一千四百名菲律宾人和二百五十名华侨，组成舰队，去同荷兰殖民者争夺印度尼西亚出产香料的岛屿。西班牙殖民者“偃息卧船上，使华人日夜驾船。稍倦，辄箠之，或刺杀，苦毒备尝”（明、张燮：“东西洋考”，卷五）。华侨水手潘和五等商议：“叛死，箠死、刺死，等死耳。不然，亦且战死，不若杀酋以泄吾愤”（同上）。于是起来暴动，杀死总督以下的西班牙官吏，粉碎了他们的掠夺计划。一七四○年，巴达维亚华侨反抗荷兰殖民者的暴虐行动，武装起义。爪哇各地华侨纷纷响应，爪哇人民也参加进来，积极合作。当地一些封建土王，也在华侨和爪哇人民联合起义的影响下，支持他们来反对荷兰殖民统治的斗争。这次起义给了荷兰东印度公司很大的打击。在西方殖民者侵入亚洲的初期，中国人民同亚洲国家人民就已这样同心协力，互相支援，来进行反抗斗争了。
    中国同印度、巴基斯坦和锡兰的友好关系，更可以说是源远流长，根深叶茂。将近两千年以前，印度的佛教开始传入中国。从汉代到宋代，不少印度高僧来中国宣教。更多的中国高僧不畏艰险，长途跋涉，去到“西天”和师子国（即锡兰）取经求法。他们所译出的数千卷佛经，绝大多数在印度早已失传，是今天研究印度古代文化的宝藏。法显、玄奘和义净等人关于印度的记载，更替印度历史保存下宝贵资料。这里，我们特别应该提出八世纪新罗（朝鲜）高僧慧超到印度的旅行记。他来唐学习，又经中亚到印度。西行十年，回唐之后终老于五台山。慧超用汉文所写旅行记不仅是我们今天研究印度历史的重要材料，而且是中国、印度和朝鲜三国友谊关系史上的可贵纪念。中印文化关系体现在艺术上，如云冈的石佛和敦煌的壁画，都是我们所熟知的。佛经里所保留的一些印度民间故事和寓言，往往也为中国人民所爱好，得到广泛流传。印度的文化艺术通过中国的媒介，又向东传到朝鲜和日本。介于中印之间的尼泊尔，七世纪以来便同中国通好。十三世纪时，尼泊尔著名匠师阿尔尼格来中国。他长于绘画、塑像和铸金等，当时北京寺院佛像多出其手。尼泊尔同西藏地方经济联系尤其密切，西藏佛寺造像装饰等等，也多倚赖尼泊尔的师匠。
    在贸易来往和物产交流方面，中印两国同样地保持着悠久而密切的关系。孟加拉、印度南部东西两岸和锡兰岛都是中国历代商船往来的地区。据马可波罗记载，世界各国船舶都到印度西南海岸经商，而中国船最多。印度商船也装运胡椒、香料和各种珍贵货物，到泉州贸易。据十四世纪阿拉伯旅行家的记载，当时印度中国间的交通主要是依靠中国船；大船四层，可载千人，房间很多；中国商客大都预订来回舱位，极为拥挤，可以想见盛况。明代侯显和郑和等都曾到过印度南部和锡兰。梵语里称桃为“汉持来”，梨为“汉王子”，这就说明这些水果来自中国。梵语里的钢、红铅、某种葫芦和樟脑的名称都冠以中国字样，这也暗示着它们的来源。七世纪末，梵语里已有“纸”字，它大约是由中亚陆路传入印度的。十一世纪末叶起，印度用纸书写逐渐普遍。到十五世纪初年，孟加拉地方已用树皮造纸。当时中国人描写印度的白纸说：“光滑细腻，如鹿皮一般”（马欢：“瀛涯胜览”）。这都是在日常生活方面中国对于印度的贡献。在中国，胡椒、茉莉花等是从印度移植来的，沙糖的制造方法也是从印度传来的。以前中国只知道作冰糖，七世纪初才由印度北部摩揭陀国使臣传来榨蔗汁熬成沙糖的方法。中印两国各方面关系都极其悠久而密切。尤其是在这样久的历史时期和这样长的国界线上，中印两国从未发生过战争，这更是世界历史上所少有的。
    西亚各国虽然距离中国较远，但这些国家在历史上也都同中国有过颇为密切的关系。只是近代西方殖民主义者侵略势力进入亚洲，才妨碍了中国同这些国家之间传统友谊的发展。印度往西是阿富汗，当它建立起第一个独立的吉慈尼王朝以后，辽圣宗和高昌的西州回纥可汗一起派遣使臣，携带礼物，并以箭为信，去见阿富汗历史上有名的苏丹马合木，要求通好。圣宗的信里称誉马合木说：“朕久闻卿英武卓越，统制有方。国内安靖，藩镇慑服。”（见阿拉伯人麻瓦奇：“关于中国、突厥和印度之记载”，英译本）南宋人虽同阿富汗没有直接往来，但当时的书中也有关于“吉慈尼国”和国王勇武善战的记载。至于往西的伊朗，同中国的关系就更加密切了。公元一世纪班超的部下已经到过当时伊朗境内的安息国，后来安息王子安世高到中国来宣扬佛教，是中国佛教史上繙译佛经确实可考的第一人。南北朝以后，波斯始终同中国维持友好关系。唐代扬州和广州等地有大批波斯商人往来，设立“波斯胡店”，经营珠宝香料生意。波斯湾上的港口也都常有中国商船停泊。不少植物如石榴、胡麻、胡桃和菠菜是由波斯传入，中国传入波斯的有丝、纸、大黄和黄连等。有些波斯商人在中国长住不归，如唐末“土生波斯”李珣善作词，所作词为人传诵，同中国词人作品一起被收入“花间集”里。波斯的火袄教和起源于波斯的摩尼教，先后传入中国。火袄教主要是波斯和中亚商人信奉，唐代长安洛阳两京都立有火袄教寺院。摩尼教在唐代主要为回纥人所信奉，但后来在中国南北各地大为流通。
    中国同阿拉伯国家历史上的友谊关系，也是十分深厚的。在伊斯兰教进入叙利亚以前，叙利亚人所创的景教（基督教之一派），曾在唐代传进中国，受到政府的保护，建寺度僧。今天西安还保存着当时建立的“景教流行中国碑”，上面用叙利亚文刻着东来的景教长老们的名字。阿拉伯（当时称为大食）在七世纪中叶同中国正式通交。从八世纪初到十五世纪末，无论是汉族的两宋政权或者契丹、蒙古政权，都同阿拉伯保持着非常密切的贸易关系。交、广、泉、扬等州，都是阿拉伯商人频繁来往的港口。他们一般是贩运香料药材犀象珠宝到中国来，再买丝绸、磁器等回去。郑和下“西洋”曾到阿拉伯半岛上的阿丹和祖法儿，他的部下还朝觐了天房。中国同阿拉伯的文化交流，尤其对两国有深刻影响。伊斯兰教从阿拉伯传入中国，阿拉伯的医术和历法对于中国文化有重要贡献。中国的造纸术、印刷术、指南针和火药，都是最先向西传入阿拉伯国家，再通过阿拉伯人传入欧洲的。八世纪在阿拉伯统治下的萨末鞬（即撒马儿汗）建立了西亚最早的造纸工业，制造火药必要的硝被阿拉伯人称为“中国雪”。唐、宋、元时代都有阿拉伯人留居中国不归，唐代有中进士的李彦升，宋末有管理市舶的蒲寿庚，元代阿拉伯人在中国服务的尤其多。无论就人民的往来、文化的影响或者商业的交易来看，中国同阿拉伯国家都有着悠久的传统，这是值得我们发扬光大的。
    新中国成立以来，同亚洲国家之间的和平贸易和文化交流已经日益发展；同非洲各国的和平友谊也日渐增进。回顾一下两千年来中国同亚洲国家的友好关系，将可增强我们推进亚非地区和平友好合作关系的信心。这将是世界和平的重要保证。
