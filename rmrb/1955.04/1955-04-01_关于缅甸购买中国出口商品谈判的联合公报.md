The representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the delegation of the Government Procurement of the Union of Burma held friendly talks in Beijing to implement the Trade Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma signed in Rangoon on April 22, 1954, and the Protocol on the Exchange of Burmese Rice for Chinese Export Commodities and its annex signed in Beijing on November 3, 1954.

As a result of the above-mentioned talks, the delegation of the Government Procurement of the Union of Burma and the China National Metals and Electrical Equipment Import Corporation, the China Silk Corporation, and the China National Sundries Export Corporation signed three contracts in Beijing on March 28, 1955, for the purchase of Chinese hardware, steel, building materials, sanitary equipment, paper, cotton yarn, raw silk, etc.

According to the above-mentioned contracts, the Government of the People's Republic of China will sell to the Government of the Union of Burma a total of 36 kinds of commodities, including various steel products, steel plates, iron pipes, cotton yarn, newsprint, glass, carpets, sanitary equipment, ceramic tiles, iron beds, and raw silk, with a total value of approximately 1.9 million pounds sterling.

Negotiations on many other types of commodities will continue between representatives designated by both parties through direct or written means.

The visit to China by a large number of private merchant representatives accompanying the delegation of the Government Procurement of the Union of Burma and their contacts with various Chinese state-owned companies have convinced both parties that the enormous potential for transactions in Chinese export commodities listed in the annex to the Trade Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma signed in Rangoon last April does exist, and the two governments will also assist the development of trade between Burmese private merchants and various Chinese state-owned companies.

During the negotiations, official and non-official representatives of the delegation of the Government Procurement of the Union of Burma also visited various Chinese commodity manufacturing factories in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Shenyang, Anshan, and Fushun to enhance their understanding of Chinese commodity production and quality specifications.

The two governments are convinced that the signing of the above-mentioned contracts will further promote the consolidation and development of trade between China and Burma, and will further open up broad prospects for economic cooperation between the two countries, thereby further consolidating and enhancing the friendship between China and Burma.

    关于缅甸购买中国出口商品谈判的联合公报
    中华人民共和国政府代表和缅甸联邦政府采购代表团为实现一九五四年四月二十二日在仰光签订的中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦的贸易协定，和一九五四年十一月三日在北京签订的中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦关于缅甸大米同中国出口商品换货议定书及其附件，在北京进行了友好的商谈。
    根据上述商谈的结果，由缅甸联邦政府采购代表团和中国五金电工进口公司、中国丝绸公司和中国杂品出口公司在一九五五年三月二十八日在北京分别签订了购买中国五金钢材、建筑器材、卫生设备、纸张、棉纱、生丝等三个合同。
    根据上述合同，中华人民共和国政府出售给缅甸联邦政府的商品有各种钢材、钢板、铁管、棉纱、新闻纸、玻璃、地毯、卫生设备、磁砖、铁床及生丝等共计三十六种商品，总值约达一百九十万英镑。
    其他许多种类商品的商谈，将由双方指定的代表继续通过直接的或书面的方式进行。
    随同缅甸联邦政府采购代表团来的大批私商代表来中国访问和他们同各中国国营公司的接触，使我们双方相信就去年四月在仰光签订的中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦贸易协定附件中所列举的中国出口商品的交易的巨大可能性是存在的，两国政府亦将帮助缅甸的私商和中国各国营公司之间贸易的发展。
    在谈判期间，缅甸联邦政府采购代表团的官方及非官方代表们并分别参观了北京、上海、杭州、天津、沈阳、鞍山和抚顺等地各项中国商品的制造工厂，以增进对中国商品生产情况及品质规格的了解。
    两国政府深信，上述各项合同的签订，将促进中缅两国间的贸易进一步巩固和发展，并为两国在经济上的相互合作进一步开辟了广阔的前途，从而进一步巩固和增进中缅两国间的友谊。
                  一九五五年三月二十八日
