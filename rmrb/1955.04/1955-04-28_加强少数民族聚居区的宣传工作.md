    The Chinese Communist Party's Shanmu Township Branch in Majiang County, Guizhou Province, has recently strengthened its propaganda work in remote villages inhabited by ethnic minorities. In addition to educating local propagandists to actively carry out propaganda work, the branch also educates party members and propagandists from other villages to provide assistance. Under the branch's leadership and emphasis, propaganda work in these ethnic minority villages has begun to develop. Propagandist Yang Zhengqing used the opportunity of teaching folk songs to promote the significance of conscripting soldiers. Ethnic minority propagandist Yang Zhengchang used his native language to explain to the masses the information from the Farmers' Daily that "one ton of flue-cured tobacco can be exchanged for eight tons of steel." After the masses understood that growing flue-cured tobacco could support the country's socialist industrialization, they began to grow it enthusiastically. For example, no one in Xiaoping Village had ever grown flue-cured tobacco before, but this year the entire village planted 21,000 plants. The propagandists also used the fact that the income of the members of the Songbai Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in remote areas had generally increased to educate and encourage the masses. As a result, two mutual aid teams in Xiaoping Village merged into a larger team and formulated a spring plowing production plan, preparing to create conditions for establishing a cooperative based on successful production.

    加强少数民族聚居区的宣传工作
    贵州省麻江县中共杉木乡支部，最近加强了对少数民族聚居的边远村寨的宣传工作。支部除了教育当地的宣传员积极做好宣传工作外，还教育其他村寨的党员、宣传员给以帮助。在支部的重视领导下，这些少数民族聚居村寨的宣传工作开展起来了。宣传员杨正清利用教唱山歌的机会宣传了征集补充兵员的意义。少数民族宣传员杨正昌用本族语言，把农民报上“一吨烤烟可换八吨钢”的材料讲给群众听，使群众懂得种烤烟可以支援国家社会主义工业化的道理后，纷纷种烤烟。例如小坪村过去没有人种过烤烟，今年全村种了二万一千株。宣传员们还运用边远地区松柏农业生产合作社社员普遍增加收入的事实教育群众，鼓舞了群众。小坪村的两个互助组因此联成了大组，并订出春耕生产计划，准备在搞好生产的基础上创造办社条件。
