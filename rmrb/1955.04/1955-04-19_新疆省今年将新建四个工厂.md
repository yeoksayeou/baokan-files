This year, Xinjiang Province will build four new factories. Construction of the new Xinjiang No. 2 Cement Plant will strive to complete part of the project this year. Its designed capacity is about ten times larger than the current No. 1 Cement Plant. It will not only further supply the cement needed for water conservancy projects and other basic construction projects in the province but also produce a large amount of cement for the future construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. Each year it can save the country over 10 million yuan in truck freight for transporting cement from inland areas. The new sulfuric acid plant will be completed in the fourth quarter of this year. After it starts production, it can fully supply the Xinjiang "July 1st" Textile Mill's dyeing and finishing plant and the transportation departments with the sulfuric acid they need. It can also supply a portion of the sulfuric acid needed for manufacturing fertilizer in agriculture and making felt tubes by handicraftsmen. The Bayicheng automated oil extraction plant in southern Xinjiang is scheduled to test run in the fourth quarter of this year. After it is officially put into production next year, it can produce two to three tons of oil per day, greatly supplying the edible oil needs of people of all ethnic groups. After the new Kashgar Hydroelectric Power Plant is put into production next year, its power generation will increase threefold compared to the original Kashgar Thermal Power Plant. It can not only fully supply the electricity for factories such as the Kashgar Farm Implement Factory but also supply lighting electricity for various government agencies and schools in Kashgar City.

    新疆省今年将新建四个工厂
    今年，新疆省将新建四个工厂。新建新疆第二水泥厂今年将争取部分施工，它的设计能力比现在的第一水泥厂大十倍左右，不仅能进一步供应本省水利工程以及其他基本建设工程所需要的水泥，并能为将来兰新铁路的修建生产大批水泥，每年还可以为国家节省一千多万元从关内调运水泥的汽车运费。新建制酸厂将在今年第四季度建成，它开工生产后可以充分供应新疆七一棉纺织厂印染场以及交通运输部门所需要的硫酸，还能供应农业上制造肥料、手工业者制造毡筒所需要的一部分硫酸。南疆拜城自动化榨油厂计划在今年第四季度试车，明年正式投入生产后，一天可产油两吨至三吨，大量供应各族人民的食油需要。新建喀什水电厂明年投入生产后，将比原来喀什火力发电厂的发电量增加三倍，不但可以充分供应喀什农具厂等工厂的电力，还可以供应喀什市各机关、学校的照明用电。
