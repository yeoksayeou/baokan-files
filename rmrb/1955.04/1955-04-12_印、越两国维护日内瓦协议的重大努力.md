    India and Vietnam's Major Efforts to Maintain the Geneva Accords

    Recently, Pham Van Dong, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, visited India at the invitation of Prime Minister Nehru, held talks with him, and issued a joint communique. The communique reached a consensus on the relations between the two countries, particularly on the issue of maintaining the Geneva Accords. This meeting further developed the relations between the Republic of India and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which are based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and will make a significant contribution to the implementation of the Geneva Accords and the consolidation of peace in Indochina and Asia.

    The people of India and Vietnam have had a deep friendship for a long time. The Vietnamese people received sympathy and support from the Indian people in their long struggle for independence and freedom. The Indian government and people have made great contributions to the conclusion of the Geneva Accords and the restoration of peace in Indochina. India holds the chairmanship of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Indochina and is working to supervise the implementation of the Vietnam ceasefire agreement. The government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have consistently and faithfully fulfilled the Geneva Accords. The common interests of the Indian and Vietnamese people in the Southeast Asian region and their joint efforts to maintain peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia are developing their friendship.

    The talks between the two countries focused on the Geneva Accords and the work of the International Commission. The joint communique reaffirmed the full support of both governments for the Geneva Accords and their determination to implement the terms and spirit of the agreement. They agreed that it is important to hold free elections and achieve the unification of Vietnam in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords. This position and proposition are very important in the current situation in Indochina. As the communique points out, the individual and joint efforts made by the signatory countries and the International Commission have produced good results. However, the difficulties that have arisen should be resolved.

    It should be pointed out that these difficulties are caused by the US government's open interference in the Indochina situation, hostility to, and sabotage of, the Geneva Accords. Indian Prime Minister Nehru recently criticized this interference in Indochina in a speech to the People's Assembly.

    As everyone knows, since the Bangkok Conference, the US's conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Accords has become even more rampant. The United States is stepping up the implementation of the Collins Plan, strengthening South Vietnam's military forces, interfering in South Vietnam's internal affairs, and creating conflicts in South Vietnam. The United States instigated the French Federal forces and the Ngo Dinh Diem group to continue large-scale forced abduction of residents in the Haiphong area, and to abduct and destroy public property in large quantities. US Secretary of State Dulles also openly declared that he would obstruct the general election in Vietnam, claiming that it "would be difficult" to create conditions for free elections in North Vietnam. The Ngo Dinh Diem group also echoed the US by clamoring for elections "supervised by the United Nations" and launching attacks on the International Commission. Recently, the United States also planned to hold a meeting with France to unilaterally discuss the Indochina issue in an attempt to further undermine the Geneva Accords.

    The relevant parties and peace-loving people around the world must pay serious attention to this US conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Accords. The Indian government and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's expression of their determination to uphold the Geneva Accords is very important for consolidating peace in Indochina and throughout Southeast Asia.

    The joint communique of the Indo-Vietnamese talks reaffirmed the two governments' heartfelt support for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and agreed that the faithful observance of these five principles is the best guarantee of world peace and friendship among nations. As everyone knows, last October, Prime Minister Nehru and President Ho Chi Minh's talks in Hanoi confirmed the Five Principles as the guiding principles in international relations.

    At the same time, the promotion of the Five Principles is also of great significance for maintaining and developing peaceful and good-neighborly relations among the countries of Indochina. The joint communique reaffirmed that they believe that maintaining good-neighborly relations between Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos in accordance with the principles of the Geneva Accords and the Five Principles will help promote a political solution to the Indochina issue and promote the cause of peace in Southeast Asia. As everyone knows, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly declared its sincere good-neighborly policy. Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong said in September last year: "According to the five principles mentioned in the Sino-Indian Joint Statement and the Sino-Burmese Joint Statement, the establishment of friendly neighborly relations between the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Government of the Kingdom of Laos and the Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia will also greatly contribute to the restoration and consolidation of peace in Indochina." Recently, it has also been noted that the delegation of the Royal Government of Cambodia in Delhi also expressed its agreement to accept the Five Principles. This shows that the Five Principles have provided a reliable basis for peaceful cooperative relations between the countries of Indochina. Without the forced intervention of the United States, the peaceful cooperative relations between the countries of Indochina will surely develop normally. This is clearly beneficial to the peace of Southeast Asia and the entire Asia.

    The Chinese people express warm welcome to the enhancement of friendly relations between India and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the basis of the Five Principles, and to their efforts to resolutely maintain the implementation of the Geneva Accords. The Chinese people will continue to fulfill their obligations under the Geneva Accords, and are willing to work together with the people of India, Vietnam and other relevant countries to implement the Geneva Accords.

### 印、越两国维护日内瓦协议的重大努力

    印、越两国维护日内瓦协议的重大努力
    最近，越南民主共和国副总理兼外长范文同应邀访问了印度，同印度总理尼赫鲁举行了会谈，并发表了联合公报。这个公报就两国的关系，特别是维护日内瓦协议的问题，取得了一致的意见。这次会谈使印度共和国和越南民主共和国在五项原则基础上建立的关系，得到了进一步的发展，对于贯彻实施日内瓦协议、巩固印度支那和亚洲的和平，将有显著的贡献。
    印度和越南两国人民很久以来就有着深厚友谊。越南人民在争取独立自由的长期斗争中，得到印度人民的同情和支持。印度政府和人民对促成日内瓦协议、恢复印度支那的和平，作出了很大的贡献。印度担任了印度支那国际监督和监察委员会主席的职务，正在为监督实施越南停止敌对行动协定而努力。越南民主共和国政府和人民一贯忠实地履行日内瓦协议。印度人民和越南民主共和国人民在东南亚地区的共同利益，和他们维护印度支那和东南亚和平的共同努力，使他们之间的友谊正在发展。
    两国会谈特别讨论了有关日内瓦协议和国际委员会的工作问题。联合公报重申两国政府完全支持日内瓦协议，决心贯彻协议的条款和精神。他们一致认为，根据日内瓦协议的规定举行自由选举和实现越南统一是重要的。这个立场和主张，在目前印度支那局势下，显得非常重要。正如公报所指出的，协议签字国和国际委员会所作的单独的和联合的努力，已经产生良好的效果。但是，出现的困难应当予以解决。
    应该指出，这种困难是由于美国政府公开干涉印度支那局势，敌视和破坏日内瓦协议所造成的。印度总理尼赫鲁最近在人民院发表的演说中，指责了对印度支那的这种干涉行为。
    大家知道，曼谷会议以后，美国破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋活动，更加嚣张了。美国正在加紧执行柯林斯计划，加强南越军事力量，干涉南越内政，并制造南越纷争。美国嗾使法兰西联邦部队和吴庭艳集团在海防地区继续大规模地强迫劫运居民，大量劫运和破坏公共财产。美国国务卿杜勒斯还公然声言要阻挠越南的普选，硬说要在越南北部创造自由选举的条件“会是困难的”。吴庭艳集团也跟在美国后面叫嚷什么由“联合国监督”选举，并对国际委员会滥施攻击。最近，美国又策划同法国举行会议，以片面讨论印度支那问题，企图进一步破坏日内瓦协议。
    对于美国这种破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋活动，有关方面和全世界爱好和平人民必须予以严重注意。印度政府同越南民主共和国政府表示它们维护日内瓦协议的决心，对巩固印度支那和整个东南亚的和平，是十分重要的。
    印、越两国会谈公报重申两国政府对于和平共处的五项原则的衷心支持，一致认为切实遵守这五项原则就是世界和平和各国友谊的最好保证。大家知道，去年十月，尼赫鲁总理同胡志明主席在河内的会谈结果，就已确认五项原则为国际关系中的指导原则。
    同时，五项原则的推广，对于维护和发展印度支那各国间的和平和善邻关系也具有重大的意义。联合公报重申：他们相信越南、柬埔寨和老挝三国之间依照日内瓦协议的原则和五项原则保持善邻关系，将有助于促进印度支那问题的政治解决和促进东南亚的和平事业。大家知道，越南民主共和国政府曾一再宣布它的真诚的善邻政策。范文同副总理在去年九月就曾说过：“根据中印联合声明和中缅联合声明中提到的五项原则，越南民主共和国政府和老挝王国政府以及柬埔寨王国政府之间建立友好的邻邦关系，这也将大大有助于印度支那和平的恢复和巩固。”最近，人们还注意到，柬埔寨王国政府代表团在德里也表示同意接受五项原则。这就表明，五项原则已为印度支那各国的和平合作关系提供可靠的基础。如果没有美国的强制干涉，印度支那各国的和平合作的关系一定会得到正常的发展。这显然是有利于东南亚和整个亚洲的和平的。
    中国人民对于印度和越南民主共和国在五项原则基础上建立的友好关系的增进，对于它们坚决维护日内瓦协议的实施的努力，表示热烈的欢迎。中国人民将继续履行自己所承担的日内瓦协议中的义务，并愿与印度、越南和其他有关国家的人民一道，为贯彻实现日内瓦协议而共同努力。
