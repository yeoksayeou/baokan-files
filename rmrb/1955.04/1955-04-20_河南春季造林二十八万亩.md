Henan Province has overfulfilled its spring afforestation task. According to incomplete statistics as of March 20, the province's afforestation area has reached 280,000 mu, completing 102% of the plan. Currently, various regions are engaged in forest protection and cultivation.

In order to realize the overall plan for harnessing the Yellow River and to cooperate with the Huai River control and other water conservancy projects, the upper reaches of the Yi River, Luo River, and other water systems, as well as the Bo Mountain, Nanwan, Baisha, and Shimantan Reservoirs, were the focus of spring afforestation efforts to create water source forests. In over ten years, these water source forests will play a role in conserving soil and water, replenishing water sources, consolidating dikes, reducing water and drought disasters, and protecting reservoir projects. In order to transform sandy and alkaline land, prevent wind disasters, regulate the climate, and ensure good crop growth, eastern Henan and Yuanyang County planted shelterbelts this spring. In addition, more than 100,000 mu of walnuts were planted in various regions. Xingyang, Xin'an, Linxian, and Lingbao counties, as well as the hilly areas of Luoyang and Zhengzhou suburbs, planted more than 90,000 apple trees, and the Yifeng Orchard of the Minquan Mechanical Farm in the sandy desert area of eastern Henan planted more than 50,000 grape vines.

    河南春季造林二十八万亩
    河南省春季造林任务已经超额完成。据三月二十日不完全统计，全省造林面积已达二十八万亩，完成计划百分之一百零二。现在各地正进行护林、育林工作。
    为了实现根治黄河的整体规划并配合治淮等水利工程，伊河、洛河等水系和薄山、南湾、白沙、石漫滩水库上游今春重点进行了水源林的营造工作。十余年后，这些水源林就会起到保持水土、涵养水源、巩固堤岸、减免水旱灾害和保护水库工程的作用。为了改造沙地、碱地，预防风灾，调节气候，保障农作物很好地生长，豫东及原阳县今春栽植了防护林。另外，各地区播种核桃十万多亩。荥阳、新安、林县、灵宝等县和洛阳、郑州两市郊区丘陵地带栽植苹果九万多株，豫东沙荒区民权机械农场仪封果园栽植葡萄五万多株。（本报集体通讯员河南日报编辑部）
