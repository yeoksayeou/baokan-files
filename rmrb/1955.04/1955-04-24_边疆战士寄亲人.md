To the Editor:

We – the soldiers stationed on the frontier of the motherland and participating in frontier construction – often read with joy the letters of greeting from our relatives in the motherland. These letters come from various provinces of the motherland, from organizations such as government offices, factories, schools, and hospitals, and from many residents. They describe their feelings and hopes from different perspectives and in different posts.

Comrade Xia Zhenshu of the National Committee of the China Education Trade Union praised our achievements in road construction in her letter. She expressed boundless concern for the future construction of the Kangzang Plateau. She said with emotion: "I am an educator, and I will definitely learn from your great spirit of patriotism. If I encounter difficulties in the future, I will muster the courage to overcome them like you do when opening mountains!"

Many students and children in schools affectionately describe their happy lives. Li Guiying, a student at the Second Complete Primary School in Bo'ai County, Henan Province, said: "In the past, my family suffered from the exploitation and oppression of landlords. We couldn't eat enough or dress warmly, and our lives were very poor. Today, our lives are growing upwards like crops that have received rain. Not only do we have enough food and clothing, but I can also happily go to school. I will definitely study hard, exercise, and cultivate the 'five loves' to become a well-rounded person and build our motherland into a beautiful socialist garden!"

From the letters of many urban residents, we can see the changes taking place in people. Male and female students at the Longwangmiao First District Night School in Chongqing have all transformed from illiterates into "cultured people." Many letters contained graded artwork. Comrade Yang Zhongyi drew a beautiful city with a pencil and wrote on it: "Happy Hometown."

Our relatives all connect their happy lives with our cause of defending the motherland. Comrade Zhou Changyu, a nurse in the emergency room of the Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Medical College, said: We cannot but thank the soldiers guarding the border for allowing our children to sleep peacefully and our parents to work in peaceful days. Bai Zhaoyan, a student at Beijing No. 2 Girls' Middle School, excitedly sent a letter while decorating the venue and rehearsing programs for the Spring Festival, saying: "Now, I think of you – dear comrades. It is because you are guarding the border that we can study peacefully and live happily."

While describing their happy lives, many relatives have also thought of the Taiwanese compatriots who are living in misery. Therefore, "Resolutely liberate our territory of Taiwan" has become everyone's common vow.

When we read these letters, we cannot help but be deeply moved. How fast the motherland is advancing! How quickly and beautifully the people's lives are changing!

When we read these letters, we deeply feel the strength of our power. We fully understand that behind us, there are the wishes and wills of 600 million hearts, which is our encouragement and support. We have the strength and confidence to complete all tasks and guard the southwest border.

Recalling the summer of 1954, when the troops were building roads in the Bomi area, during the day, the soldiers fought against the scorching sun, heavy rain, mountain torrents, quicksand, and giant rocks. On rainy nights, the soldiers baked their wet clothes in tents while replying to letters from their relatives, reporting their construction progress. When the troops built the Kangzang Highway over the last great mountain – Sejila Mountain – the letters of greetings from people of all ethnic groups encouraged the soldiers' enthusiasm. In the severe winter, on the mountain more than 4,000 meters above sea level, everyone happily blasted mountains, felled trees, and erected bridges, with work efficiency reaching more than 170% of the standard work.

After the opening of the road to Lhasa, letters of greetings poured in even more. These letters not only enable us to more correctly estimate the source of our achievements in order to overcome complacency; but also strengthen our fighting spirit, making us full of confidence to meet new tasks, to be stationed on the frontier for a long time, and to consolidate national defense.

We believe that our mutual correspondence is not only a manifestation of "the army and the people are one family", but also a manifestation of the new relationship of love and unity between socialist people.

We hope that our relatives in Beijing will often tell us everything about the capital. Although we are far away from the capital and stationed on the remote border, our hearts are always yearning for this place and missing this place, because this is not an ordinary city in the motherland, this is the place where the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, is located. We especially welcome any words and phrases sent from Beijing.

We ask our relatives to introduce their family life and their work and study, because this change and happiness mean the change of our entire society.

We ask for examples of "supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers", because these facts will give the soldiers a deeper education and encourage us to work better.

We are grateful to our relatives for their care and love, and we are determined to answer their care with practical actions.

Propaganda Assistant, a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Wang Ye

### 边疆战士寄亲人

    边疆战士寄亲人编辑同志：
    我们——驻守在祖国边疆、参加边疆建设的战士，经常以愉快的心情朗诵着祖国亲人们的慰问信。这些信件，来自祖国各个省份、来自机关、工厂、学校、医院等团体和许多居民。他们在不同的岗位上，从不同的角度叙述着自己的感想和希望。
    中国教育工会全国委员会夏贞淑同志，在信中赞扬了我们修路的成绩，她对康藏高原的建设前途，寄予无限的关怀。她感动地说：“我是一个教育工作者，一定学习你们这种伟大的爱国主义精神，以后如果遇到困难，我会鼓起勇气，像你们开山一样的战胜它！”
    许多学校的同学、小朋友都亲切地叙述着自己的幸福生活。河南省博爱县第二完全小学同学李桂英这样说：“过去，我家受着地主的剥削和压迫，吃不饱，穿不暖，生活十分贫苦；今天的生活，像得了雨水的庄稼一样向上长，不但丰衣足食，而且我还能愉快地进学校学习。我一定好好学习，锻炼身体，养成‘五爱’的品德，成为一个健全的人材，把祖国建设成一个美丽的社会主义花园！”
    从许多城市居民的来信中，可以看到人们身上所发生的变化。重庆市龙王庙第一区夜校的男女学员都由文盲变成了“文化人”；不少信内装着评了分数的美术作品，杨忠义同志用铅笔画了一座风景优美的城市，上面写着：“幸福的家乡”。
    亲人们都把自己的幸福生活和我们保卫祖国的事业联结在一起。湖北医学院附属医院急诊室护士周长玉同志说：我们的孩子所以能够安静地睡眠，父母们所以能够在和平的日子里工作，不能不感谢守卫边疆的战士。北京女二中白昭艳同学在布置欢度除夕的会场和排演节目的时候，兴奋地寄来一信说：“现在，我想起了你们——亲爱的同志们，是由于你们守卫着边疆，我们才能安心地学习，愉快地生活。”
    许许多多的亲人们在叙述自己幸福生活的同时，都连想到了生活在苦难中的台湾同胞。因而
  “坚决解放我们的领土台湾”便成了大家共同的誓言。
    当我们读到这些信件的时候，我们不能不深受感动。祖国前进的步伐多么快啊！人民的生活变化得多么快多么美好啊！
    当我们读到这些信件的时候，我们深深感到我们力量的雄厚。我们十分了解，在我们的背后，有着六万万颗心的愿望和意志，这就是对我们的鞭策和支持。我们有力量有把握完成各项任务，守卫在西南边疆。
    回忆一九五四年夏天，部队在波密地区筑路，白天，战士们和烈日、暴雨、山洪、流砂、巨石搏斗着。在阴雨的夜晚，战士们在帐篷中一面烤着白天淋湿了的衣服，一面给亲人回信，向亲人报告自己的施工情况。当部队把康藏公路修过最后一座大山——色齐拉山的时候，各族人民的慰问信鼓舞了战士们的热情。在严冬，在拔海四千多公尺的山上，大家愉快地开山放炮，砍伐树木，架设桥梁，工作效率达到标准工的百分之一百七十以上。
    通车拉萨以后，慰问信更是源源不绝。这些信件不仅可使我们更正确地估计成绩的来源，以克服骄傲自满情绪；同时也加强了我们的斗志，使我们信心百倍地迎接新的任务，长期驻守边疆，巩固国防。
    我们认为，我们大家的相互通讯，不仅是“军民一家”的表现，而且也是社会主义人与人之间友爱团结的新关系的表现。
    我们希望北京的亲人经常把首都的一切情况告诉我们。我们虽然远离首都，驻守在遥远的边疆，但我们的心时刻向往着这个地方，怀念着这个地方，因为这不是一般的祖国城市，这是中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席所在的地方。从北京寄来的片言只字，我们都特别欢迎。
    我们要求亲人介绍自己家庭生活和自己的工作学习等情况，因为这种变化和幸福，正意味着我们整个社会的变化。
    我们要求写“拥军优属”的事例，因为这些事实，会给战士们更深刻的教育，鼓舞我们更好地工作。
    我们感激亲人对我们的关怀和热爱，我们决心用实际行动回答亲人们的关怀。
