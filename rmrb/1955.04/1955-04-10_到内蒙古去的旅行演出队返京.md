Traveling Performing Arts Troupe Returns to Beijing from Inner Mongolia
The traveling performing arts troupe from the China Youth Art Theatre, which went to Inner Mongolia, has now returned to Beijing. Over the past two months, the troupe performed a total of forty-two shows in Hohhot and Baotou, with more than 40,000 people watching the plays "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nomin River" and "Steel Transport Soldiers," including Mongolian cadres and herdsmen from the grasslands. In Baotou, the troupe specially performed four shows of "Steel Transport Soldiers" to salute the people developing the rich resources of the motherland.

During this traveling performance, the actors extensively interacted with local workers, students, and theater workers. While performing in Baotou, the actors braved the severe cold of minus twenty degrees Celsius to visit the "March 8th" Women's Drilling Team, which was dozens of miles away, and held a get-together. The actors of "Steel Transport Soldiers" introduced their experiences of living on the Korean battlefield and the characteristics of theatrical art to more than 2,400 teachers and students from some middle schools in Baotou. The actors and directors of the troupe also held discussions with theater workers in Hohhot on the experience of theatrical creation, and observed and learned from each other. (Xinhua News Agency)

    到内蒙古去的旅行演出队返京
    中国青年艺术剧院到内蒙古去的旅行演出队，现已回到北京。两个月以来，旅行演出队在呼和浩特市和包头市共演出了四十二场，有四万多人看了话剧“春风吹到诺敏河”和“钢铁运输兵”，其中有来自草原的蒙族干部和牧民。在包头市，演出队特地演出四场“钢铁运输兵”，慰问开发祖国富源的人们。
    这次旅行演出期间，演员们广泛地和当地的工人、学生、戏剧工作者接触。在包头市演出时，演员们冒着零下二十度的严寒，到几十里外去慰问“三八”女子钻探组，并举行了联欢会。“钢铁运输兵”的演员向包头市一些中学的二千四百多名师生介绍了他们在朝鲜战场上体验生活的感受和话剧艺术的特点。演出队的演员和导演还和呼和浩特市戏剧工作者座谈了戏剧创作的经验，并互相观摩学习。　（新华社）
