    More Than Ten Key Projects of Baolan Railway Start Construction
    At the southern end of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, a major transportation artery connecting North and Northwest China, more than ten key projects, including the Xingxingwan Large Tunnel, the Donggang Town Double-Track Tunnel, and the Donggang Town Yellow River Arch Bridge, have successively commenced construction.

    In the 68-kilometer section from Lanzhou to Xingxingwan, the engineering work is very arduous. Hundreds of mountain-opening and road-building machines, and hundreds of trucks, horse-drawn carts, and handcarts are working day and night in intense activity. The construction workers have laid dozens of kilometers of light-rail tracks in the mountain valleys and erected aerial transport lines between the mountains. They have also adopted small-scale machinery such as double-rail sliding slope cars, power winches, and conveyor belts. The "bulldozer train" created by labor model Zhang Songnian is also operating on the construction site. The workers excavating the earth and stone outside the Xingxingwan Large Tunnel have built a soil transport tower four to five meters high, using pulleys to lift the earth and stone excavated from the bottom of the ditch to the top of the mountain for transportation.

    Currently, the vast number of workers have already thrown themselves into the labor competition to welcome "May Day," and the progress of each project is very rapid.

    包兰路十多个重点工程开工
    连接华北、西北的交通大动脉——包（头）兰（州）铁路南端，已经有猩猩湾大隧道、东岗镇双线隧道、东岗镇黄河大拱桥等十多个重点工程陆续开工。
    从兰州到猩猩湾的六十八公里地段内，工程很艰巨，上百台开山筑路机器，数百辆汽车、马车、手拉车，正在日夜紧张地工作着。筑路职工在山沟里铺设了总长几十公里的轻便轨道，在两山之间架起高空运输线。他们还采用了双轨滑坡车、动力绞车、输送带等小型机械。劳动模范张松年创造的“推土机列车”也在工地上开动着。开挖猩猩湾大隧道洞外土石方的工人，搭起了一座四、五丈高的运土楼，用辘辘把沟底挖出来的土石方吊到山顶上运出去。
    现在，广大职工已经投入了迎接“五一”的劳动竞赛，各项工程的进展都很迅速。
