Yichang and Other Ports Begin Using Mechanical Loading and Unloading

    Many ports along the Yangtze River, which previously relied mainly on manual labor for handling goods, have now begun to use new mechanical equipment for loading and unloading.

    Since 1954, the Yangtze River Shipping Administration has gradually added a number of mechanical equipment at key ports along the entire line. In Yichang Port, which has a large transshipment task, there were only three floating cranes in the past, but now there are Soviet-made universal loaders and China's own loaders and belt conveyors.川粮(Sichuan grain) exported from the southwest is transported to the Yichang Port wharf. In the past, workers had to carry each package up the bank, but now the grain packages can be placed directly on the belt conveyor to reach their destination. The belt conveyor trial-produced by Yichang Port itself can transport 130 to 150 tons of goods per hour, which saves a lot of manpower. In Chongqing Port, which serves as the gateway to the southwest, in addition to the original mechanized wharf, electric winches have also been added to specially lift heavy steel.

    This year, the focus of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration's addition of loading and unloading machinery is Hankou Port, which has the largest throughput in the entire Yangtze River. At the third, eighth, and tenth wharves of this port, which load and unload general merchandise and Sichuan grain, belt conveyors, truck cranes, and other equipment will be purchased this year; mechanical loading and unloading of heavy pieces will also be added to the Jiang'an area wharf connected to the railway, striving to build a specialized mechanized wharf. In addition, belt or crawler conveyors will also be added to Huangshi Port and Nanjing Port. After these machines are put into production, they will accelerate the turnover of ships on key routes of the Yangtze River.

    宜昌等港开始用机械装卸货物
    长江沿岸许多过去以人力搬运为主的港口，现在已经开始使用新式机械装卸货物。
    从一九五四年起，长江航运管理局便在全线重点港口，逐步添置了许多机械设备。在中转任务很大的宜昌港，过去只有三艘吊船，现在已经有了苏联制造的万能装卸机和我国自己制造的装卸机、皮带运输机。由西南出口的川粮运到宜昌港码头，过去完全要工人一人夯一包爬上岸，现在粮食包只要放在皮带运输机上，就可以直接送到目的地。宜昌港自己试制的皮带运输机，每小时可以运一百三十吨到一百五十吨货，使用起来节省了很多人力。在作为西南门户的重庆港，除原有一座机械化码头外，还添置了电动绞车，专门起运笨重的钢材。
    今年，长江航运管理局添置装卸机械的重点是全长江吞吐量最大的汉口港。在这个港的第三、第八、第十等装卸杂货、川粮的码头上，今年将要添购皮带运输机、汽车吊杆等设备；和铁路联接的江岸一带码头，也将添置机械装卸重件，争取专门建设一个机械化码头。此外，在黄石港、南京港也将添置皮带式或履带式运输机。这些机械投入生产后，将加速长江重点航线的船舶周转。
