Pay Attention to Popularizing and Propagating Superior Varieties

Unlocking the potential of existing cultivated land and increasing yield per unit area is the main way to increase agricultural production in our country at present. Planting superior varieties is one of the effective methods to increase yield per unit area.

The effectiveness of this method has long been proven by the production experience of Chinese farmers over thousands of years. The facts since liberation have further demonstrated its tremendous role. In the past five years, the planting area of improved varieties of grain and oil crops in our country has reached more than 300 million mu, and the planting area of improved varieties of cotton has reached more than 50 million mu. The "Bima No. 1" improved wheat variety, which is more widely promoted, has increased production by more than ten jin to more than one hundred jin per mu in Guanzhong, Shaanxi, and other places; the "Nante No." early rice improved variety has increased production by 80 jin to 250 jin per mu in northern Jiangsu and other places; the "Victory Rapeseed" improved variety promoted in Sichuan can increase production by 50 to 200 jin per mu. From this, we can see how significant the promotion of superior varieties is to improving agricultural production!

Planting superior varieties is a yield-increasing measure that costs very little, yields quick results, and is easy to implement. It is suitable for the current economic and technical conditions of the vast number of farmers in our country.

The emergence rate of superior varieties is higher than that of general varieties, and it can ensure full and vigorous seedlings, avoiding the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges, which not only does not cost more seeds, but can greatly save the seeds used for initial planting and replanting. Planting certain superior varieties, as long as appropriate fertilization is applied, will yield great harvests. Therefore, planting superior varieties costs the least, and every farmer can do it.

Many farmers in our country have already mastered the technology of seed selection and seed soaking and mixing. The technology of planting superior varieties is also very easy to learn. Now our country has more than 2,000 state-owned farms (including provincial, prefectural, and county farms), and more than 100,000 agricultural scientific and technical personnel. Relying on this strong technical guidance force, we can completely teach farmers the technology of selecting and planting superior varieties relatively quickly.

In the work of popularizing and propagating superior varieties, we should implement the principle of "local propagation and local popularization." According to incomplete statistics from various regions, there are more than 1,300 kinds of farmer-selected superior varieties in our country. These varieties have been growing and reproducing in certain areas for a certain period of time. Their characteristics are familiar to the local people, so promotion is relatively easy, and there are many opportunities for success, which can quickly achieve good results. The flat-eared wheat selected and bred by Shandong model worker Yu Qingshou and his wife, the large-grain awned wheat selected and bred by Huangxian Zhong Weifang and his wife, and the Laolaiqing japonica rice selected and bred by Jiangsu Chen Yongkang have all been expanded to hundreds of thousands or even more than one million mu. The superior spring wheat varieties selected and propagated by Dingxingzhai Village, Xin County, Shanxi, are quickly exchanged by farmers within a hundred miles or so after each harvest. It can be seen that farmer-selected superior varieties are loved by the vast number of farmers. Agricultural departments in various regions should attach importance to and discover farmer-selected superior varieties, and organize farmers to exchange them with each other, using the power of the masses to popularize various superior varieties in suitable areas as soon as possible. Agricultural technicians should be responsible for reviewing and appraising these farmer-selected superior varieties, studying their adaptability, and cultivating and improving them. Some agricultural technicians despise farmer-selected superior varieties, which is wrong. Of course, the adaptability of some farmer-selected superior varieties is subject to many restrictions, but is there anything strange about this? We never ask to expand the promotion area of farmer-selected superior varieties indefinitely, but only require "local propagation and local popularization." A superior variety, even if it can only adapt to one county or one district, can benefit local farmers and should be promoted. At the same time, we must also attach importance to imported superior varieties. The adaptability of superior varieties introduced from other places is often wider, and the yield increase benefits are often greater; but they must be tested and demonstrated by certain scientific research institutions or state-owned farms, and "actively publicized and steadily promoted," and should not be blindly promoted on a large scale.

In order to do a good job in promoting superior varieties, we must overcome the current phenomenon of laissez-faire. This is another deviation in the work of popularizing superior varieties after opposing subjectivist leadership methods in agricultural production in 1952. Because agricultural authorities in many regions have abandoned leadership over this work, the promotion of many superior varieties has not achieved significant results for several years. After the Ministry of Agriculture convened a national seed work conference in December last year, this situation began to change. But until now, except for more than a dozen provinces such as Shaanxi, Qinghai, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, and Sichuan, most provinces and regions still lack specific plans and arrangements for the review, appraisal, trial demonstration, and propagation of existing superior varieties, which must be changed quickly.

The leading organs in a few regions have the idea of "superior varieties are omnipotent," and blindly promote them regardless of conditions, causing undue losses to farmers, which should also be corrected. In 1954, Weinan Prefecture, Shaanxi Province, blindly promoted "Xiaohuanggu" from Henan, and many did not head or bear fruit; Sichuan promoted "Nanda 2419" wheat seeds, and because the variety characteristics were not explained in detail, one million mu of wheat fields were reduced in production. A few years ago, this phenomenon was the main deviation in the work of promoting superior varieties; although the areas where this phenomenon occurs have decreased now, we must continue to work hard to prevent it. This subjective approach often causes serious losses to farmers, wastes a lot of food, and affects the completion of the state's production increase tasks, and the consequences are very bad.

The Ministry of Agriculture plans to expand the planting area of improved varieties of grain, oil crops, and cotton by more than 60 million mu nationwide this year. The southern provinces have already started sowing, the northern regions are preparing for sowing, and many areas in the south, such as Yunnan, Sichuan, Fujian, Guangdong, and other provinces, have begun or will soon begin harvesting spring crops such as wheat and rapeseed. This is an appropriate time to promote, propagate, and retain superior varieties. All localities should rely on state-owned farms and mutual aid and cooperative organizations to work hard to do this work well and prepare conditions for the large-scale promotion of superior varieties next year.

The institutions responsible for supplying seeds, such as the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Commerce, and supply and marketing cooperatives, should quickly supply superior varieties to farmers. Last year, some places caused a bad influence because they failed to supply seeds in time, or supplied farmers with insect-infested and moldy seeds and mixed seeds as superior varieties. Similar phenomena must be prevented this year. The institutions under the Ministry of Agriculture should guide farmers to improve cultivation techniques before and during sowing, because only cultivation techniques that are adapted to superior varieties can enable superior varieties to exert greater effectiveness. In the past, some regions only focused on promoting superior varieties, but did not guide farmers to improve cultivation techniques, and that method must be changed. In areas that are starting to harvest and preparing to harvest spring crops such as wheat and rapeseed, agricultural departments should promptly guide farmers to carry out seed selection and retention, and assist food, commerce, and other departments to purchase and store superior varieties according to plan.

In order to quickly and effectively carry out the work of promoting superior varieties, it is necessary to propagate superior varieties in a planned manner. All superior varieties to be promoted next year should be propagated by state-owned farms (including provincial, prefectural, and county experimental propagation farms) and specially contracted agricultural production cooperatives. All major crops planted on state-owned farms must have seed retention plots (fields). In order to prepare superior varieties for next year, agricultural production cooperatives should also establish seed retention plots (fields) with the consent of their members. It should be made clear to farmers that there are many benefits to establishing seed retention plots. It saves time and labor compared with universal ear selection in the field, and it can obtain pure and fine seeds. Establishing seed retention plots is also convenient for field management, which can combine seed selection and breeding work, greatly improving the effect of seed selection. Some farmers in Zhejiang, Fujian, and other provinces established seed retention fields in 1954 and achieved great results. This method should be widely publicized to agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various regions, which will greatly help further expand the planting area of improved varieties and improve seed quality next year.

    注意推广和繁殖优良品种
    发挥现有耕地的潜力，提高单位面积产量，这是我国目前增加农业生产的主要途径。种植优良品种，是提高单位面积产量的有效办法之一。
    这种办法的效果，早已被我国农民几千年来的生产经验所证明了。解放以来的事实，更加证明了它的巨大作用。近五年来，我国粮食、油料的良种种植面积已达三亿多亩，棉花的良种种植面积已达五千多万亩。推广较为普遍的“碧玛一号”小麦良种，在陕西关中等地，每亩增产十余斤到百余斤；“南特号”早稻良种在苏北等地每亩增产八十斤至二百五十斤；四川推广的“胜利油菜”良种每亩可增产五十至二百斤。由此可见，推广优良品种对提高农业生产有着多么重大的意义！
    种植优良品种，是一种花钱很少、收效很快而且容易实现的增产措施。它是适合于我国广大农民当前的经济条件和技术条件的。
    优良品种的出苗率比一般品种的出苗率要高，而且能够保证苗全苗旺，避免缺苗断垄的现象，这就不但不会多费种籽，而且能够大大节省初种和补种所用的种籽。种植某些优良品种，只要适当多施肥料就有很大的收获。因此，种植优良品种花钱最少，是每一户农民都能够办到的。
    我国不少农民已经掌握了选种和浸种、拌种的技术。种植优良品种的技术也很容易学会。现在我国已经有了两千多个国营农场（包括省、专区和县的农场），十多万农业科学技术人员，依靠这支强大的技术指导力量，完全能够比较迅速地教会农民选用和种植优良品种的技术。
    在推广和繁殖优良品种的工作中，应该贯彻“就地繁殖，就地推广”的方针。据各地极不完全的统计，我国现有的农家优良品种有一千三百多种，这些品种在一定地区中生长繁殖，都有了一定的历史。它们的特性已为当地群众所熟悉，因此，推广比较容易，成功机会极多，能够迅速获得良好的效果。山东劳动模范于青绶夫妇选育的扁穗小麦，黄县仲维芳夫妇选育的大粒半芒麦种，江苏陈永康选育的老来青粳稻种，种植面积都已经扩大到几十万以至一百多万亩。山西忻县定兴寨村选育繁殖的春小麦优良品种，每年收获以后，很快就被周围百十里内的农民串换完了。可见农家优良品种是为广大农民群众所喜爱的。各地农业部门应该重视和发现农家优良品种，并组织农民互相串换，运用群众的力量，把各种优良品种，在适应地区尽快地普及开来。农业技术干部应该负责审查鉴定这些农家优良品种，研究它的适应性，加以培育和提高。有些农业技术干部轻视农家优良品种，这是错误的。当然，有些农家优良品种的适应性受到许多限制，但这有什么奇怪呢？我们绝不要求无限制地扩大农家优良品种的推广面积，而只是要求“就地繁殖，就地推广”。一种优良品种，即使只能适应一县、一区，对当地农民都有增产的效益，都是应该加以推广的。同时我们也要重视外来的优良品种。由外地引进的优良品种的适应性常常更广，增产效益常常更大；但必须经过一定试验研究机关或国营农场的试验示范，“积极宣传，稳步推广”，不可盲目大量推广。
    为了做好推广优良品种的工作，必须克服目前存在着的某些放任自流的现象。这是在一九五二年反对农业生产中主观主义的领导方法以后，在推广优良品种工作中发生的另一方面的偏向。因为不少地区的农业机关放弃了对这一工作的领导，所以许多优良品种的推广，几年来一直没有显著成效。在去年十二月农业部召开了全国种籽工作会议以后，这种情况开始有了改变。但是直到现在，除陕西、青海、黑龙江、浙江、四川等十几省以外，多数省区对于现有优良品种的审查鉴定、试验示范和繁殖的工作，还缺乏具体的计划和布置，这是必须迅速改变的。
    少数地区的领导机关存在着“良种万能”的思想，不看条件，盲目推广，给农民造成不应有的损失，这是同样应该纠正的。一九五四年陕西渭南专区盲目推广河南的“小黄谷”，有许多不抽穗不结实；四川推广“南大二四一九”麦种，因为没有详细交代品种特性，有一百万亩的麦田都减产了。在几年以前，这种现象曾经是推广优良品种工作中的主要偏向；现在发生这种现象的地区虽然减少了，但必须继续努力防止。这种主观主义的作法，常常给农民造成严重的损失，并且浪费大量粮食，影响国家增产任务的完成，后果是很坏的。
    农业部今年计划在全国扩大粮食、油料和棉花良种种植面积六千多万亩。现在南部各省已经开始播种，北方各地正在准备播种，南方不少地区如云南、四川、福建、广东等省并已开始或即将开始收割小麦、油菜等春季作物。这是推广、繁殖和留选优良品种的适当的时机，各地应该依靠国营农场和互助合作组织，努力把这一工作作好，为明年大量推广优良品种准备条件。
    粮食部、商业部和供销合作社等负责供应种籽的机构，应该赶快把优良品种供应到农民的手里。去年有些地方曾经因为供应种籽不及时，或把生虫霉烂的种籽和混杂的种籽当作优良品种供应农民，造成恶劣的影响，今年一定要防止发生类似的现象。农业部所属机构要在播种前和播种时指导农民改进栽培技术，因为只有和优良品种相适应的栽培技术，才能使优良品种发挥更大的效能。以往有些地区只顾推广优良品种，而不去指导农民改进栽培技术，那种办法必须改变。在开始收割和准备收割小麦、油菜等春季作物的地区，农业部门应该及时指导农民进行选种留种工作，并协助粮食、商业等部门，按计划把优良品种收购和储藏起来。
    为了迅速有效地开展推广优良品种的工作，必须有计划地繁殖优良品种。所有明年准备推广的优良品种，都应由国营农场（省、专区和县的试验繁殖农场在内）和特约的农业生产合作社负责繁殖。在国营农场种植的主要作物，都必须设立留种地（田）。农业生产合作社为了给明年准备优良品种，也应该经过社员的同意设立留种地（田）。应该向农民说清楚，设立留种地的好处是很多的，它比普遍田间穗选省时省工，又能获得纯洁精良的种籽。设立留种地还便于进行田间管理，可以把选种和培育良种的工作结合起来，大大提高选种的效果。浙江、福建等省部分农民一九五四年设立了留种田，都取得很大成绩。应该向各地农业生产合作社和互助组广泛宣传这种方法，这对明年进一步扩大良种种植面积和提高种籽质量有很大帮助。
