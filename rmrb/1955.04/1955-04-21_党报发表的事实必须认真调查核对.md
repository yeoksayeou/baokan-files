    Facts Published in Party Newspapers Must Be Carefully Investigated and Verified
    Zuo Hua
    Editorial departments of various newspapers have already paid attention to investigating and verifying the authors and facts of critical submissions. However, many newspapers have not yet attached importance to investigating and verifying the authors and facts of commendatory submissions. There is still a harmful view in the minds of these newspaper editors, which is that "even if there are some discrepancies in the facts of commendation, it will not cause dissatisfaction among those involved."
    A false report exposed by the Shaanxi Peasant Newspaper not long ago proves that this view is very dangerous. The Shaanxi Peasant Newspaper received a submission signed by Zhang Guangyu. The author claimed to be the "public security committee member" and "village public security worker," "grain purchase evaluation committee member and group leader," etc., of a township in the sixth district of Qianxian County. The submission described how he actively sold surplus grain, how he helped the work team publicize the policy of unified purchase and sale, how he "refused bribes, and was honest and dedicated," etc. Zhang Guangyu also attached 100,000 yuan (old currency) to the submission, saying that this was the bribe given to him by Ji Wanyuan, a surplus grain household in the village. In order to "educate the vast number of readers," he requested the newspaper to publish this submission. The plot seemed reasonable and logical, and there seemed to be no reason for further suspicion. However, after the Shaanxi Peasant Newspaper editorial department asked the Qianxian County Sixth District Committee of the Communist Party of China to investigate, it was found that this Zhang Guangyu was a big bad guy. He raped women, extorted farmers, and embezzled public grain and funds, committing heinous crimes. The 100,000 yuan he claimed to have "refused as a bribe" was actually extorted from the farmer Ji Wanyuan. Because someone exposed his crimes, he hurriedly submitted the article to the Shaanxi Peasant Newspaper, reversing black and white and framing good people. Now this big bad guy has been arrested according to law.
    In this new period of class struggle, counter-revolutionary elements and other bad elements are using various opportunities to undermine the cause of our Party and the people. Newspapers are one aspect they attempt to exploit. In order to attack good cadres who hinder their sabotage activities, they falsely accuse these good cadres of being bad elements to the newspapers; in order to facilitate their various sabotage activities, they use newspapers to boast about their great contributions to the country, in order to deceive people and acquire the title of a good cadre. Zhang Guangyu is such a person. He attempted to use the newspaper to promote himself as an active, honest and dedicated model cadre, and thereby scare the masses who had opinions on him: Look, I have been commended by the Communist Party's newspaper, how dare you accuse me!
    In this case, if the newspaper editorial department does not raise its vigilance and does not investigate and verify all submissions, it will give these bad elements an opportunity to take advantage of, thereby causing incalculable losses to the Party and the people. Investigating and verifying the author of the submission and the facts reported by him must not be regarded as a technical job; it is a political job. This is not only to prevent the conspiracy of bad elements, but also an indispensable way to ensure the authenticity of news. Newspaper editorial departments should establish and improve this investigation and verification system as soon as possible with a serious and earnest attitude.

    党报发表的事实必须认真调查核对
    佐华
    各报编辑部对批评稿件的作者和事实已注意进行调查核对。但是不少报纸还没有重视对表扬性稿件的作者和事实的调查核对。这些报纸编辑人员思想上还存在着一种有害的看法，那就是
  “表扬的事实即使有点出入，也不会引起当事人的不满”。
    不久前陕西农民报所揭露的一个假报道，就证明了这种看法是非常危险的。陕西农民报接到一篇署名张光宇的来稿。作者自称是乾县六区一个乡的“治安委员”兼“村治安工作员”、“购粮评议委员和小组长”等。来稿中叙述了他如何积极卖余粮，如何帮助工作组宣传统购统销政策，如何“拒绝行贿，廉洁奉公”等等。张光宇还随稿附来了人民币十万元（旧币），说这就是该村余粮户吉万元给他的贿赂。他为了“教育广大读者”，请求报社发表这篇稿件。看起来情节合情合理，好像不应该再有什么怀疑的了。可是陕西农民报编辑部请中共乾县六区委员会调查后，发现这个张光宇是一个大坏蛋。他奸污妇女，敲诈农民，贪污公粮公款，罪恶深重。他所称的“拒绝受贿”的十万元，实际上是他向农民吉万元敲诈来的。因为有人识破了他的罪行，他赶忙投稿给陕西农民报，颠倒黑白，陷害好人。现在这个大坏蛋已经依法逮捕。
    在这阶级斗争的新时期，反革命分子及其他坏分子就是利用各种机会来破坏我们党和人民的事业的。报纸是他们企图利用的一个方面。为了打击阻碍他们进行破坏活动的好干部，他们就向报纸诬告这些好干部是坏分子；为了便于他们进行各种破坏活动，他们就利用报纸吹嘘他们曾对国家有很大的贡献，骗取好干部的称号。张光宇就是这样一个人。他就是企图利用报纸把他自己吹嘘成为一个工作积极、廉洁奉公的模范干部，并由此可以吓唬对他有意见的群众：你看，我是被共产党的报纸表扬了的，你敢去控告！
    在这种情况下，报纸编辑部如果不提高警惕，不对一切稿件进行调查核对，那就会给这些坏分子以可乘之机，从而使党和人民遭受不可估量的损失。对稿件的作者和他所报道的事实进行调查核对，绝不能把它当做一种技术性的工作；它是一种政治工作。这不只是可以防止坏分子的阴谋，而且是保证新闻真实性的一个绝不可少的办法。报纸编辑部应该用严肃认真的态度，从速建立和健全这种调查核对制度。
