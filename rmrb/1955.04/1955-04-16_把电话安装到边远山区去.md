    The local telecommunications engineering surveying team dispatched by the Hebei Provincial Post and Telecommunications Administration has begun surveying and erecting telephone lines in remote mountain areas that previously had no telephone service. By April 10th, they had already surveyed 150 kilometers of lines. It is planned that all remote mountain and pastoral areas in the province that do not have telephone service will have telephones installed by the end of October 1955.
    The areas where Hebei Province plans to erect telephone lines this year are all mountainous and pastoral areas with inconvenient transportation. In the past, these areas relied entirely on horses or camels to communicate with other places, and it took about a week for a round trip to distant places. After the installation of telephones, communication between these areas and the outside world will be much more convenient.

    把电话安装到边远山区去
    热河省邮电管理局派出的地方电信工程测量队，开始在过去不通电话的边远山区测量和架设电话线路。到四月十日，他们已经测量了一百五十多公里线路。计划在一九五五年十月底以前，全省不通电话的边远山区和牧区全部要安上电话。
    热河省今年计划架设电话线路的地区，都是交通不便的山区和牧区。过去这些地区全靠马或骆驼和外地联系，到远的地方往返一次要走一个星期左右。安上电话以后，这些地区和外界的联系就方便多了。（新华社）
