To the Editor:

There is a farm in Guangxi Province that has the best equipment but the worst production: the Xijiang Mechanical Farm. This farm possesses 300,000 mu of land, with more than 81,000 mu currently cultivated. It has 45 tractors, a main farm and five branch farms, one operational area, and also brick and tile factories, processing plants, repair shops, a motor vehicle team, a hygiene team, a basic construction brigade, a road construction committee, a water conservancy brigade, a workers' cooperative, etc. A farm with such equipment is unique in Guangxi and should be a banner for socialist agriculture throughout the province.

However, the actual situation is not like that. This farm not only fails to complete the state grain production plan and accumulate construction funds, but also causes the state to lose a large amount of property. In 1954, the rice output only reached 35.9 percent of the plan. The average yield of early rice was 92.1 jin per mu, and the average yield of late dry rice was only 3.3 jin per mu.

The sowing, tilling, and topdressing of the farm's main crops are mostly behind schedule, and cultivation is rough. The peanuts planted by the farm suffer from an average of about 30 percent missing seedlings due to poor seed selection. During the harvest, there is also serious waste. For example, in the Fifth Branch Farm, peanuts lost during the harvest on 7.5 mu of peanut fields accounted for 48.3 percent of the harvest per mu. In addition, 80 percent of the 45 tractors and 89 tractor drivers are idle most of the time. Due to increased production costs and reduced yields, the production plan could not be completed, resulting in a total loss of 550,000 yuan in agricultural production in 1954.

In contrast to the production situation, the farm leaders treat the farm as their own small world, arbitrarily placing personal connections and reimbursing expenses. Farm Director (and Party Secretary) Hong Hua once went home to visit relatives. The Director of the Department of Agriculture only approved Hong Hua's trip, but Hong Hua took his wife, guard, nanny, and children, a group of six people, back to Yutian County, Hebei Province. When they returned, they not only reimbursed the travel expenses of the guard, nanny, and children from public funds, but even reimbursed the children's food allowance for the journey, totaling more than 750 yuan in transportation fees, more than 260 yuan in medical expenses, and more than 20 yuan in miscellaneous expenses, totaling more than 1,040 yuan. This expense is equal to half of the total output of early rice, which had a relatively high yield in the farm in 1954. Deputy Farm Director Lin Zijiang and his wife, Li Min, also took their guards, nannies, children, and six people home in May and September, spending more than 440 yuan in total. The sum of these two travel expenses is equal to the income from 2,793 mu of rice planted by the farm in 1954.

Hong Hua brought ten people from his hometown, including his and his wife Li Yanling's biological brothers, cousins, second cousins, and female cousins, and reportedly even those who had been struggled against. After these people arrived at the farm, except for his mother-in-law who was not assigned a job and was supported by public funds, the others were properly assigned jobs. Some drove horse carts with wages about twice as high as those of the original workers, some became nurses, and some were assigned to study in tractor training classes. Many of them were sick or disabled and did not meet the requirements at all. Therefore, some people say that "the Xijiang Farm has become the Wang family compound" (Hong Hua's original surname was Wang).

How can a farm like this, with no production plan and so much waste, produce grain and accumulate construction funds for the country? How can it play a demonstrative role?

### 广西西江农场生产不好浪费很大

    广西西江农场生产不好浪费很大编辑同志：
    广西省有一个设备最好，生产最糟的农场——西江机械农场。这个农场拥有土地三十万亩，现耕地八万一千多亩，有拖拉机四十五台，设有总场和五个分场，一个作业区，还有砖瓦厂、加工厂、修理厂、汽车队、卫生队、基本建设大队、筑路委员会、水利大队、职工合作社等。像这样设备的农场在广西来说还是唯一无二的，它应该成为全省社会主义农业的一面旗帜。
    但是，实际情况不是这样。这个农场不但不能完成国家粮食生产计划，积累建设资金，反而使国家损失大量财产。一九五四年稻谷的产量只完成计划的百分之三十五点九，中早水稻每亩平均产量九十二点一斤，晚旱稻每亩平均产量只有三斤三两。
    农场主要农作物的播种、中耕、追肥，大部分都违误农时，耕作粗糙。农场种的花生因选种不好，平均有百分之三十左右缺苗；收获的时候，又有严重的浪费，如五分场有七亩半花生地，收获时被遗失的花生足足占了每亩收获量的百分之四十八点三。另外，四十五台拖拉机八十九个拖拉机手有百分之八十的时间闲着。由于生产成本提高，产量降低，生产计划完不成，结果一九五四年农业生产总亏损五十五万元。
    与生产情况形成对比的是农场负责人把农场当成自己的小天地，任意安插私人，报销开支。场长（兼党委书记）洪华有一次回家探亲，农业厅长只批准洪华一人回去，而洪华却带着爱人、警卫员、媬姆、小孩等一行六人浩浩荡荡的回到了河北玉田县。回来的时候，不但向公家报销了警卫员、媬姆、孩子的旅费，连小孩旅途伙食补助也报销了。共计车船费七百五十多元，医药费二百六十多元，公杂费二十多元，合计是一千零四十多元。他这笔费用等于农场一九五四年产量较高的早水稻全部产量的一半。副场长林子江及其爱人李珉于五月及九月也先后带着警卫员、媬姆、小孩等六人回家，共花去四百四十多元。如果拿这两笔返家路费加起来就等于一九五四年农场种的二千七百九十三亩水稻的收入。
    洪华从家里带来了十个人，这里面有洪华和他爱人李燕玲的胞兄弟、堂兄弟、表兄弟、表妹等，据说还有被斗户。这些人到了农场后，除了他的岳母没有分配工作，由公家供给生活外，其他都妥妥贴贴地分配好了。有赶马车的，工资比原有工人高一倍左右，有当护士的，有分到拖拉机训练班学习的。其中不少是有病或残废的，根本不合条件。因此有人说“西江农场变为王家大院了”（洪华本姓王）。
    像这样生产没计划，浪费很大的农场，怎能为国家生产粮食、积累建设资金呢？又怎能起着示范作用呢？　古凡
