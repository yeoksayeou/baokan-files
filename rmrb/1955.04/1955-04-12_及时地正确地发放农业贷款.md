Delay in issuing agricultural loans is a major problem in current rural financial work. Now that we are in the crucial season for spring plowing, agricultural loans must be issued quickly so that they can be used at the most appropriate "moment." Otherwise, if the farming season is missed, it will affect the annual agricultural production increase plan, completely negating the meaning of issuing agricultural loans.

Some rural financial work cadres believe that farmers have money in hand this year and "there is not much difficulty," and that many credit cooperatives have been established, so "all difficulties can be solved by the credit cooperatives." Therefore, it does not matter whether agricultural loans are issued or not. In some areas, the leading organs do not pay enough attention to agricultural loan work and have not arranged this work properly, so it has been squeezed out by other work. Some cadres believe that this year's agricultural loan funds are relatively small, and the task can be easily completed, so it can be done "slowly." These are the main reasons for the slow issuance of agricultural loans. For example, in Qinghai Province and some other provinces and regions, the arrangement of agricultural loan work in the first half of the year was too late, and the loan work has not yet been fully launched. Obviously, this is very wrong.

Do farmers really not need loans? Of course not. Many agricultural production cooperatives need to carry out basic construction and expand investment, and must borrow from banks. Many poor farmers, especially poor farmers in disaster areas, have many difficulties in production and life and also need to borrow from banks. As long as you go deep into the masses to make a visit and help farmers arrange their production and life for the whole year, you will find that farmers need loans, and they need them urgently. Accumulating loans will be opposed by the farmers.

Of course, timely issuance of agricultural loans does not mean doing things carelessly. This tendency has occurred in previous years, and now it is even easier to occur due to the urgency of time, and must be prevented. We require that loans be issued both in a timely and correct manner. We believe that in order to issue loans well, it is necessary to grasp the following two aspects.

This year's agricultural loan work is facing a new situation of great development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement. Agricultural loan work should adapt to this new situation and actively support agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations in production. The State Bank has stipulated the loan limit for agricultural production cooperatives, which should generally not exceed 5% to 10% of the total annual income. This regulation is in line with the actual situation. The development of agricultural production cooperatives should mainly rely on their own manpower and financial resources, and state loans can only help meet its insufficient parts. By implementing this spirit, the state can use limited agricultural loan funds to help more farmers who need assistance. However, many rural financial work cadres believe that since it is necessary to actively support agricultural production cooperatives, more loans should be given to them. The Hunan Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China proposed this spring to "lend to agricultural production cooperatives the difference of insufficient self-raised funds," and approved an agricultural loan of 419 yuan to the Hongxing First Cooperative of Xinong Township, Erqu District, Dongkou County, and has lent 200 yuan. After inspection, the cooperative's production funds were not difficult. Not only was the lent 200 yuan left unused, but also its own funds of 129 yuan were left unused in the cooperative. The Fujian Provincial Branch proposed that this spring's agricultural loans "mainly meet the capital needs of agricultural production cooperatives to expand reproduction," and the Xikang Provincial Branch decided to lend an average of 10 million yuan (old currency) to each cooperative, which are all reflections of this idea.

Does lending more to agricultural production cooperatives have a positive effect? Facts have proven that this is not the case. Lending too much to agricultural production cooperatives is not conducive to its consolidation. In 1954, many regions had such shortcomings and errors. In 1954, the "Liberation" agricultural production cooperative in Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, had 26 items of loans from the state, and even the ferry money for members to cross the river had to be solved by loans. Many agricultural production cooperatives reduced the distribution income of their members due to excessive debts. Some agricultural production cooperatives simply rely on loans to "live on" and relax their efforts to improve business management. This bad result is mainly caused by blind loans, how can this consolidate the cooperative?

Of course, the above-mentioned loan limit is not unchangeable. It is necessary to oppose excessive and blind lending, and to prevent too mechanical mastery of the number of loans. For cooperatives in disaster-stricken areas, cooperatives with a large proportion of poor peasants, and cooperatives that need to invest more in planting special crops, loans can be appropriately increased; for cooperatives with abundant economic strength and no difficulty or little difficulty in production, loans can be reduced or not given. Loans must focus on supporting agricultural production, but at the same time, they should take care of sideline production and the living difficulties of some members. Permanent mutual aid groups that are actively preparing to become cooperatives can also receive appropriate care according to the principle of loans to agricultural production cooperatives if they need to add public means of production but lack funds.

Enthusiastically supporting individual poor peasants and middle peasants with difficulties is still an indispensable aspect of implementing this year's agricultural loan policy. For a long time, many rural financial work cadres have had an erroneous tendency to discriminate against poor peasants in loan work. They have arbitrarily restricted and excluded poor peasants from loans. Even some resolutions and instructions of some bank leading organs also contain this error. In this year's agricultural loan work instructions, the Heilongjiang Provincial Branch only proposed that "this year's agricultural loans should focus on agricultural production cooperatives," but did not mention loans to individual poor farmers at all. The Henan Provincial Branch even wrongly stipulated that "farmers who owe too many loans and do not repay them for a long time cannot be given loans again." It must be pointed out that poor farmers who are indeed unable to repay the loans due must never be stipulated that they cannot borrow again if the old debts have not been paid off; as long as their reasons for requesting a loan are legitimate and they really need to be helped again, they should be allowed to borrow again after considering the situation. However, those who have the ability to repay but deliberately do not repay should be treated differently.

It should be pointed out that loans to poor farmers are to help them overcome difficulties in production and life. It has long been proven by countless facts that if the difficulties of poor farmers are overcome, production is improved, and income is increased, they will repay the loans. The Fenghua County Bank in Zhejiang Province insisted on the erroneous "principle" that "if the old loan has not been repaid, less loans or no more loans should be given." Twenty-one poor farmers in Changting Township of this county have been forced to sell green seedlings because they could not get loans! Some poor farmers have been forced to borrow from usurers! This erroneous "principle" directly hit the production enthusiasm of poor farmers and opened the door to usurers. If it is said that the rural financial work in these areas has violated the Party's class policy in rural areas and violated the Party's fundamental policy of carrying out socialist transformation in rural areas, it is not an exaggeration! In the future, for poor farmers (especially very poor farmers), in addition to organizing them through the road of mutual aid and cooperation, so that they can participate in appropriate labor, increase income, and improve their lives, the bank should also provide long-term low-interest loans according to the actual situation. At the same time, it should be clearly recognized in agricultural loan work that it is not a question of giving loans to farmers without labor force; their living difficulties should be overcome by social relief methods.

The State Bank will issue more than 500 million yuan of agricultural loans in the first half of this year, and credit cooperatives will also issue more than 300 million yuan of loans, totaling more than 800 million yuan. This is a very large amount, and if it is used properly, it will have a huge effect. Farmers need loans because they need means of production and means of subsistence. Therefore, the issuance of loans should be closely combined with the work of arranging the market. Under the unified leadership of the Party and the government, local banks and credit cooperatives should establish close ties with local supply and marketing cooperatives and tell the supply and marketing cooperatives the regions, quantities, objects, and uses of funds. The supply and marketing cooperatives should prepare the necessary materials for the farmers according to these plans. Never let the investment of funds and the supply of materials be out of touch, and never cause waste of funds and excessive pressure on the market.

### 及时地正确地发放农业贷款

    及时地正确地发放农业贷款
    农业贷款发放迟缓，是当前农村金融工作中的一大问题。现在已到春耕生产的紧要时节，必须把农业贷款迅速发放下去，以便用在最恰当的“火候”上。否则，如果错过农时，就将影响全年农业增产计划，完全失掉发放农业贷款的意义。
    有些农村金融工作干部认为：今年农民手里有钱，“困难不大”，又建立了许多信用合作社，“一切困难都能由信用社解决”，因此，农业贷款发不发都不要紧。有些地区的领导机关对农贷工作重视不够，没有适当地安排这个工作，以致被其他工作挤掉了。有些干部认为今年农贷资金较少，容易完成任务，因此可以“慢慢来”。这就是农业贷款发放迟缓的主要原因。例如，青海省和其它一些省区上半年农贷工作布置过晚，贷放工作到目前还没有全面开展起来。显然，这是十分不对的。
    农民真的不需要贷款吗？当然不是。许多农业生产合作社要进行基本建设，要扩大投资，必须向银行贷款。许多贫困农民，特别是灾区的贫困农民，在生产、生活上都有许多困难，也需要向银行贷款。只要深入群众作一番访问，帮助农民把全年的生产和生活作一安排，就会发现农民需要贷款，而且要得很急。把贷款积压起来，是会遭受农民反对的。
    当然，及时发放农业贷款，这绝不意味着马马虎虎地一推了事。这种偏向历年都曾发生，现在由于时间紧迫，更是容易发生，必须加以防止。我们要求贷款发放得又及时又正确。我们认为，要想把贷款发放得好，掌握下面两个环节是必要的。
    今年的农贷工作面临着农业互助合作运动大发展的新情况。农贷工作应该适应这种新的情况，积极扶持农业互助合作组织进行生产。国家银行已经规定了农业生产合作社的贷款限额，一般应该不超过全年总收入的百分之五至百分之十。这个规定是符合实际情况的。农业生产合作社发展生产主要应当依靠本身的人力和财力，国家贷款只能帮助满足它的不足部分。贯彻这个精神，国家就可以用有限的农贷资金，扶助更多的需要扶助的农民。但是，很多农村金融工作干部认为：既然要积极扶持农业生产合作社，就应该多多贷款给它。人民银行湖南省分行在今年春季提出“贷给农业生产合作社自筹资金不足的差额”的办法，曾批准贷给洞口县二区新农乡红星第一合作社四一九元的农业贷款，并已贷出二○○元。经检查，该社生产资金并不困难，不但贷给的二○○元留着未用，即其自有资金一二九元，也放在社里没有用项。福建省分行提出今春农贷“主要满足农业生产社扩大再生产的资金需要”，西康省分行决定每个合作社平均贷给一千万元（旧币），都是这种思想的反映。
    难道对农业生产合作社多多贷款就能发生积极的效果吗？事实证明并不是这样的。对农业生产合作社贷款过多并不利于它的巩固。一九五四年很多地区就发生了这样的缺点和错误。四川省简阳县
  “解放”农业生产合作社一九五四年向国家贷款的项目有二十六项，社员过河用的摆渡钱都要靠贷款解决。不少农业生产合作社因负债过重，社员的分配收益就减少了。有些农业生产合作社单纯依赖贷款“过活”，放松了改进经营管理的努力。这种恶果主要是盲目贷款造成的，这怎么能巩固合作社呢？
    当然，上面说到的那种贷款的限额，并不是一成不变的。既要反对过多地盲目地贷款，又要防止过于机械地掌握贷款数目。对于受灾地区的合作社、贫农所占比重很大的合作社和部分种植特种作物需要投资较多的合作社，贷款可以适当多些；对于经济力量充裕、生产没有困难或困难不大的合作社，就可以不贷或少贷。贷款必须以扶助农业生产为主，但同时应照顾副业生产和部分社员的生活困难。积极准备转为合作社的常年互助组，如果需要添置公共生产资料而资金不足，也可以按照对农业生产合作社贷款的原则，受到适当的照顾。
    热情地扶助个体贫农和有困难的中农，仍然是贯彻今年农贷方针不可缺少的一个方面。不少农村金融工作干部长期以来在贷款工作上存在着歧视贫农的错误倾向。他们曾自作主张，限制和排斥贫农贷款。甚至在某些银行领导机关的决议和指示中也有这种错误。黑龙江省分行在今年的农贷工作指示中，只提出“今年农贷应以农业生产合作社为重点”，但对个体贫困农民的贷款，根本没有提到。河南省分行更错误地规定：“对积欠贷款过多，长期不还的农民，不能再予贷款”。必须指出，对确实无力偿还到期贷款的贫苦农民，绝不能规定在旧欠尚未还清时一概不得再借；只要他们要求贷款的理由正当，确实需要再予扶助，就应斟酌情况准予再借。但对个别有偿还能力而故意不还者，则应区别对待。
    应该指出：贷款给贫困农民，是为了帮助他们克服生产和生活上的困难。贫困农民的困难克服了，生产提高了，收入增加了，他们就会归还贷款，这早已被无数事实所证明了。浙江省奉化县银行坚持“旧贷款未还，应少贷款或不再贷款”的错误“原则”，这个县长汀乡已经有二十一户贫困农民因得不到贷款而被迫出卖青苗了！有的贫困农民已被迫向高利贷者求借了！这种错误的“原则”直接打击了贫困农民的生产热情，给高利贷者大开方便之门。如果说这些地区的农村金融工作已经违反了党在农村的阶级政策，违反了党在农村实行社会主义改造事业的根本政策，那是不算过分的！今后，对于贫苦农民（特别是赤贫农），除了通过互助合作的道路，把他们组织起来，使他们参加适当的劳动，增加收入，改善生活以外，银行还应根据实际情况，给以长期低利贷款的帮助。同时，在农业贷款工作中还应明确认识：对于无劳动力的农民，不是给予贷款的问题；他们的生活困难，应以社会救济的办法来克服。
    国家银行今年上半年将要发放五亿多元农业贷款，信用合作社也要发放三亿多元贷款，合计八亿多元。这是很大的数目，把它使用得当，会发生巨大的效果。农民所以需要贷款，是因为需要生产资料和生活资料。因此，发放贷款应该和安排市场的工作密切结合起来。各地银行和信用社要在党和政府的统一领导下，同当地供销合作社取得密切联系，把资金投放的地区、数量、对象和用途等告诉供销合作社；供销社要根据这些计划，准备必要的物资供给农民。绝不要让资金投放和物资供应脱节，绝不要造成资金的浪费和对市场的过度压力。
