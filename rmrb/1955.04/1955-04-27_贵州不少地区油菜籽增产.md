    Increased Rapeseed Production in Many Areas of Guizhou

      Xingyi, Wangmo, Luodian, Chishui, Tongren, and other counties in Guizhou Province have begun harvesting rapeseed. This year, the province's rapeseed planting area expanded by 47.37% compared to 1954. Although some areas suffered more severe frost damage last winter and varying degrees of drought this spring, the overall situation indicates that the province's rapeseed production this year will still increase compared to 1954. According to preliminary estimates from the Xingyi Special District, the total rapeseed production in the entire district this year may increase by 20% compared to 1954, with Xingyi County potentially increasing by 50%. Lewang Township in Wangmo County had already harvested 50,000 jin of rapeseed by the end of March, doubling the production compared to 1954. In the process of harvesting rapeseed, farmers in various regions generally paid attention to improving harvesting techniques, carefully harvesting and threshing to strive for increased yields.

    贵州不少地区油菜籽增产
      贵州省兴义、望谟、罗甸、赤水、铜仁等县已开始收获油菜籽。今年全省油菜播种面积比一九五四年扩大了百分之四十七点三七。虽然有些地区去冬遭受较严重的冻害，今春又遭受不同程度的旱灾，但从目前总的情况看，今年全省油菜籽的产量仍将比一九五四年增加。据兴义专区初步预计，今年全区油菜籽总产量可比一九五四年增加百分之二十，其中兴义县可增加百分之五十。望谟县乐旺乡在三月底已收油菜籽五万斤，比一九五四年增产一倍。在收获油菜籽的工作中，各地农民一般都注意改进了收获技术，细收细打，争取多收。
