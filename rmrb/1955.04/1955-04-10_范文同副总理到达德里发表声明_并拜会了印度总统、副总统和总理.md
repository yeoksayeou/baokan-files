Vice Premier Pham Van Dong issued the following statement upon arrival:

The delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam feels very honored and pleased to be able to visit the Republic of India, a good friend of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in South-East Asia. On behalf of the Government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, I would like to extend our heartfelt and warm congratulations to the Government and people of the great Republic of India. Since ancient times, the people of Vietnam have always cherished the warmest friendship towards the people of India. India's civilization is one of the finest and most ancient in human history, and India is currently one of the largest countries in the world, pursuing, under the leadership of Prime Minister Nehru, a policy aimed at safeguarding and consolidating peace in Asia and the world. In their continuous struggle leading to the victory of peace in Geneva, the Vietnamese people have always received the sympathy and support of the Government and people of the Republic of India. In their current struggle to strive for the correct implementation of the Geneva Accords—a struggle aimed at consolidating peace, achieving unification, and completing the independence and democracy of their beloved country—they firmly believe that they will continue to receive the sympathy and support of the Government and people of the Republic of India.

I would like to take this opportunity to convey to the Government and people of the Republic of India the sincere gratitude of the Government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for this valuable sympathy and support.

The Democratic Republic of Vietnam desires and will do its utmost to strengthen friendly ties and relations in every aspect with the Republic of India on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, in order to jointly safeguard and consolidate peace in Southeast Asia and the world together with India.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 9th.
