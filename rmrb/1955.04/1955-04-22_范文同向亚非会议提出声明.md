Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, April 21st. The Press Committee of the Asian-African Conference on April 21st published the statement submitted to the Asian-African Conference on April 20th by Pham Van Dong, Head of the Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the Asian-African Conference, and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The full text of the statement is as follows: Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates,
	Today, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is very pleased to represent the people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in extending the warmest congratulations to the Asian-African Conference and all the delegations attending the conference.
	When we congratulate this historic gathering, we are congratulating the irresistible rise of hundreds of millions of Asian and African people. We congratulate the great unity of the Asian and African people. We hail the significant role played by the Asian and African people on the contemporary international stage.
	This Asian-African Conference is full of great historical significance.
	Representing the wishes and will of the Asian and African people for peace, the Asian-African Conference is determined to maintain and consolidate peace, while resolutely defending the national rights to independence, peace, and equality. It will be a great contribution to the cause of peace in Asia, Africa, and the world. It will become the foundation for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. It will become the foundation for developing friendly and cooperative relations between Asian and African countries and with other countries around the world.
	Asian and African countries are all countries with abundant resources. They possess naturally rich and precious mineral deposits, vast and fertile plains, endless forests and mountains containing extremely valuable forest treasures, and long coastlines with unlimited aquatic resources. Our wealth is among the most precious in the world, and it is sufficient to guarantee a prosperous and happy life for the people of our region. The Asian and African regions are the cradles of the most outstanding and oldest civilizations in the areas inhabited by mankind – such as the Chinese, Indian, Arab, Egyptian, and other Asian-African civilizations. They have illuminated all mankind. Our cultural achievements are world-renowned and will forever be evidence of the glorious past of the Asian and African people. Many of our discoveries remain the most remarkable achievements of human wisdom and labor, and are part of the most valuable scientific heritage.
	However, in the past few centuries, the Asian and African people have suffered from the pain of colonial rule. They have lived extremely miserable lives due to the inhumane exploitation they have suffered in all aspects.
	National independence has been suppressed, democratic freedom has been prohibited, the rights to human survival and life have been ignored, all their potentials have been suppressed and not allowed to develop, their status and prestige have been degraded, and their progress has been hindered.
	Due to colonialism, our countries have become colonies, semi-colonies, and countries without legitimate rights, deprived of the right to self-determination and the right to occupy their place in the international family.
	But Asian and African countries have restored or are restoring their national independence, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity.
	We here are representatives of countries with different social systems and many different views. It is precisely these differences that highlight our common sentiment: the desire of all our peoples and governments for peace and independence.
	These common feelings have brought us together here. Our conference is a manifestation of the willingness of Asian and African countries to coexist peacefully and work together under the guidance of the principles of peaceful coexistence.
	We are shouldering a major responsibility before the Asian and African people and the people of all countries in the world: our responsibility is to make this gathering a great success. Our meeting itself should be an example of peaceful coexistence, and it should promote peaceful coexistence among our countries, thereby promoting peaceful coexistence among the people of all countries in the world.
	The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is very pleased to participate in this conference, and it guarantees to make its best efforts to contribute to the success of this conference and to the cause of friendship and peace for the people of Asian and African countries.
	This conference needs to address some very important issues. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam wishes to state the attitude of the people and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam towards these issues: First, the main task of this conference is to demonstrate, in an unmistakable and forceful manner, the will of the people of Asian and African countries to maintain peaceful coexistence among themselves and with the people of other countries in the world, their determination to safeguard and consolidate peace, and their resolute opposition to all war conspiracies.
	Asian and African people have never provoked wars. They have no vested interests in war. They are the victims of many wars that have taken place on their territory. Asian and African lands have often become blood-soaked battlefields, and Asian and African youth have often become cannon fodder. Many innocent civilians have been slaughtered, and many temples, pagodas, churches, schools, and cultural sites have been reduced to ashes. Many Asian and African families are still mourning their loved ones, and many Asian and African towns and villages still show the unhealed wounds of war. Isn't it enough that the first atomic bombs were dropped on Asian territory and that Asians became the victims of atomic and hydrogen bomb tests?
	Today, as we gather here, the sound of war cannons is rumbling in some parts of Asia and Africa; military aggressive blocs are being established, which seriously endanger the peace and security of the people of Asia, Africa, and the world.
	Today, the destructive power of atomic and hydrogen weapons has made everyone convinced that there is only one path to take: the path of peaceful coexistence. On the other hand, the success of the first attempts to use atomic energy for peaceful construction has unfolded the most brilliant prospects that mankind has never dreamed of.
	Therefore, the Asian and African people feel infinite hatred and disgust for war. They have the deepest hopes for peace, and they are determined to fight to maintain peace.
	The Vietnamese people belong to the Asian-African region, and they have experienced the pain of a long period of war. The Geneva Conference brought them peace for the first time in fifteen years. Therefore, the Vietnamese people, together with the Asian and African people, resolutely oppose all war conspiracies, all aggressive military treaties, and atomic war, demand the cessation of the manufacture of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the destruction of all atomic and hydrogen bombs, and wholeheartedly support the peaceful use of atomic energy to improve the material and cultural standards of the people of all countries.
	Second, for the Asian and African people, as well as for the people of all countries in the world, peaceful life is inseparable from national independence and the equality of all peoples. If the peoples of all countries are still ruled by foreign aggressors, if territories are still occupied by foreign aggressors, if there is neither national independence nor national sovereignty, then there can be no true peace.
	Today, those who intend to undermine peace are precisely the aggressors who are trying to enslave the people of Asia and Africa through behind-the-scenes activities. Historical facts prove that as long as colonialism rules Asian and African countries, these countries will only be suppliers of cannon fodder, slave labor, and war materials. They become tools of imperialist countries. Their lands become bloody battlefields.
	But because peace is the fervent desire of the people, as long as Asian and African countries strive for their independence, the right to equal treatment, and the right to decide their own destiny, then they must do their utmost to maintain peace. Only at this time can peace become true and solid peace.
	Therefore, for the Asian and African people, the struggle to maintain peace and oppose war is consistent with the struggle against aggressive imperialism, the struggle for national independence, and the struggle against racial discrimination and for the equality of all nationalities.
	Because the Vietnamese people have waged a difficult struggle to restore their own national independence and rebuild their peaceful lives, and because they have received the sympathy and support of the Asian and African people and the people of the world, they enthusiastically support all struggles of the Asian and African people against aggressive imperialism, for national independence, for equality for all nationalities, and for a peaceful life.
	Today, this struggle is being carried out in many countries in different forms.
	The Vietnamese people fully support the Chinese people's struggle to restore territorial integrity and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's struggle for unification. The Vietnamese people strongly demand that issues such as West Irian, Goa, Malaya, Kenya, and other similar issues be resolved on the basis of respect for territorial integrity and the independent and equal rights of all peoples. They wholeheartedly support the liberation movement of the African people. The Vietnamese people demand the complete abolition of colonialism and racism in Asia, Africa, and the world, and demand the complete withdrawal of foreign troops from Asia and Africa. They resolutely oppose any foreign interference, directly or indirectly, in the internal affairs of Asian and African countries in any way. The people of Asian and African countries demand lasting and stable peace, national independence, and equal rights among the people of all countries, because they hope to build a happy and prosperous life. To achieve this goal, a necessary condition is the unity, friendship, and close relations in all aspects between the people of Asian and African countries. In the history of Asian and African countries, extensive cultural exchanges and commercial exchanges have proven to be a driving force for the progress of each country and the overall development and progress of all Asian and African countries. Colonialism and war have interrupted this ancient and precious contact, erected barriers of isolation, created racial hatred, and prevented all economic and cultural exchanges. The forcibly implemented embargo in recent years is a clear proof, which has seriously damaged the economic development of Asian and African countries and the world. Since the end of World War II, along with the national liberation movement, relations between Asian and African countries have been restored and have been developing. In June 1954, the Premier of the People's Republic of China and the Prime Minister of the Republic of India jointly announced the five principles of peaceful coexistence, and later, these principles were jointly announced with the Prime Minister of the Union of Burma. This is a historic declaration that opened a new era in Asia and Africa, a new era of friendship and cooperation between Asian and African countries in the common struggle to maintain peace and strive for national independence. Since then, many Asian and African countries have successively come out to support these principles, and Asian-African unity has become a reality, which means the awakening of the Asian and African people.
	Our Asian and African countries are huge sources of manpower and raw materials. But colonialism and destructive wars have hindered our economic progress.
	This explains why we currently feel the need to expand economic exchanges and economic cooperation between Asian and African countries and between countries around the world in order to fully develop our economic potential and establish a prosperous economy, thereby improving the living standards of the people.
	Expanding cultural exchanges between our countries is a prerequisite for promoting our cultural heritage and strengthening the friendship between our people.
	The Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully support the expansion and strengthening of relations in all aspects between Asian and African countries in accordance with the five principles of peaceful coexistence.
	The struggle waged by the Vietnamese people in the past and present for peace, unification, independence, and democracy is fully in line with the aims and objectives of this conference.
	The long and arduous patriotic war waged by the Vietnamese people for more than eight years is a struggle for peace and national independence, which has aroused far-reaching repercussions. It has won the sympathy and support of the people of the world, especially the people of Asia and Africa; it has achieved two major victories, one at Dien Bien Phu and one at Geneva.
	The Geneva Conference was a major victory for the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. At the same time, it was a great contribution to peace and to the struggle of oppressed people.
	The Geneva Accords clearly stipulate the necessary terms for ending the war and restoring peace in Indochina. The Geneva Accords also stipulate the necessary terms for consolidating peace and preventing the recurrence of war. That is, it prohibits the import of new weapons and military personnel, prohibits the establishment of foreign military bases in Indochina, prohibits the use of Indochinese territory for the purpose of aggression, and prohibits Indochinese countries from participating in any military alliance.
	Implementing the Geneva Accords will not only consolidate peace, but also ease tensions in Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world.
	The Geneva Accords and the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference formally recognized the national independence and national sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and stipulated practical steps. All countries attending the Geneva Conference once guaranteed to respect the legitimate rights of the people of Indochina, guarantee not to interfere in the internal affairs of Indochinese countries, and are convinced that Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos can henceforth fully play their role in the peaceful international family in complete independence and autonomy.
	Therefore, the Geneva Accords are the first international agreement to date that most clearly and clearly recognizes the demands of small and oppressed nations striving for national liberation, and it is in line with the most precious aspirations of all disenfranchised and oppressed nations.
	Precisely because the Geneva Accords are a major victory for the forces of peace and a major victory for the national liberation movement, the people of the world, especially the people of Asia and Africa, warmly hailed the Geneva Accords and regarded them as their own victory. All leaders, governments, and public opinion of Asian and African countries unanimously welcomed and supported the Geneva Accords and demanded that all parties concerned thoroughly and correctly implement all the provisions of the agreements.
	After the Geneva Conference, Vietnam's struggle entered a new stage, the purpose of which is to thoroughly implement the armistice agreement, consolidate peace, and strive for national unification, independence, and democracy. This struggle is also a struggle to maintain peace in Asia, Africa, and the world, to develop the victory of the national liberation movement, and to achieve the full national rights of small countries that have been recognized in the agreements.
	The Vietnamese people have correctly fulfilled the terms aimed at ending the war and restoring peace under very difficult conditions.
	The Vietnamese people want peace. They have restored peace at the Geneva Conference. They are determined to fight to consolidate this restored peace. They need peace in order to rebuild their economy, which has been destroyed by fifteen years of war, and to rebuild their country, eliminate the traces of colonialism and feudalism, and continue to improve the material and cultural standards of the people. This is a well-known fact. This explains why the so-called rumors that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has increased several divisions of armed forces after the Geneva Conference are completely unfounded and have been resolutely refuted by authorized persons.
	The three-hundred-day deadline stipulated for both sides' troops to withdraw to their respective assembly areas is nearing its end. A new period is about to begin, in which the issue of unifying Vietnam through free general elections must be resolved. Vietnam is a unified country, and no one can split it. The words "unification" are imprinted in the history, geography, economy, culture, language, and customs of Vietnam. They are deeply engraved on the land of Vietnam and in the hearts of all Vietnamese people from north to south. At present, the struggle for unification is the sacred struggle of all Vietnamese people. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has announced that in order to prepare the northern and southern authorities for a consultation meeting in July 1955, it is willing to restore all normal relations between the north and the south as the first step towards achieving the unification of Vietnam, and at the same time, it has announced that it is willing to contact the southern authorities. In this regard, President Ho Chi Minh announced in the New Year: "We are prepared to sincerely unite any individuals and groups who desire peace, unification, independence, and democracy." All these facts show the sincerity, realistic spirit, and goodwill of the Vietnamese people and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
	The Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are determined to strictly and fully implement the Geneva Accords. This explains why they have always cooperated closely with the International Supervisory and Control Commission and have given the commission all assistance to help it complete its tasks.
	Laos and Cambodia are two neighboring countries of Vietnam. Like Vietnam, they will certainly fully implement the Geneva Accords that guarantee the national rights of the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has announced more than once that it is willing to establish relations with the governments of the Kingdom of Laos and Cambodia in accordance with the five principles of peaceful coexistence.
	The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also hopes and is willing to do its utmost to develop its friendship and relations in all aspects with Asian and African countries - especially with India, Burma, and Indonesia - in accordance with these five principles.
	As for France, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is willing to restore diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations with it on the basis of respect for the sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and in accordance with the principles of equality and mutual benefit.
	The Democratic Republic of Vietnam will strive to develop its fraternal relations and close ties in all aspects with friendly countries, especially with the People's Republic of China. The People's Republic of China is completely different from the old China, just as light is completely different from darkness. It is a world power that is determined to strive for its own national rights and also strive for the national rights of all countries, regardless of distance and size. It is the country that, together with the Republic of India, was the first to propose the five principles: Mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefits, and peaceful coexistence.
	All of the above proves the sincere attitude, realistic spirit, and the will to strive for peace of the Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
	However, shortly after the restoration of peace in Indochina, the aggressive imperialists who have been planning to continue and expand the war in Indochina are committed to organizing military groups against the Geneva Accords. Within the so-called "protection areas" that they will include South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, they have tried their best to expand their interference in the internal affairs of the south, establish new military bases, and transport new weapons and military personnel to South Vietnam.
	Suppressing democratic freedoms, stifling the South Vietnamese people's desire for peace and unification, creating the current disputes in the south, thereby disrupting law and order and threatening the people's peaceful existence, are all caused by them. One of their most malicious conspiracies is to lure and force a portion of the people, especially Catholics, to the south in order to provide soldiers for their newly established army and labor for their rubber plantations. They do this also to hinder the economic recovery and peaceful construction of North Vietnam. At the same time, they are also trying to stir up world opinion unfavorable to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the world, thereby realizing their dark conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Accords.
	They adopted such propaganda methods as: God has gone to the South, and those who remain in North Vietnam will not only lose their souls, but also die under the atomic bombs dropped by the Americans in North Vietnam. It is a painful fact that some people, although nostalgic for their hometowns and loyal to the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and President Ho Chi Minh, decided to go to the South because they were afraid of losing their souls and dying under atomic bombs. In addition to deception, they also used various methods of coercion to force people to the South.
	After the signing of the Geneva Accords, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam announced that those who were willing to go to the South could freely go to the South.
	Thus, people can understand why some people go to the South. They go because they have been deceived and coerced, not because they like the regime in the South and dislike the regime in the North. People may ask: Why does no one leave the South for the North? This is because the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam does not encourage this flow. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the citizens of Vietnam, whether they live in the North or live in the South, are living in their own country and are united in the common struggle for peace and territorial unification. As noted by the vast majority of foreign journalists, the hearts of all Vietnamese people, including those living in South Vietnam, are towards President Ho Chi Minh, who is the living symbol of a unified and independent Vietnam.
	This is the truth that no one can hide.
	In order to normalize relations between the North and the South, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has announced within its authority that those who are willing to go to the South can move completely freely. However, due to the difficulties caused by the South Vietnamese authorities, the flow between the North and the South is still restricted.
	All the above-mentioned activities of the aggressive imperialists are blatant violations of the Geneva Accords. The purpose of these activities is to disrupt peace in Indochina, undermine the national independence and sovereignty of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and infringe upon the territorial integrity of these countries. These activities are part of a whole conspiracy to create new tensions in Asia, Africa, and the world. The purpose of this conspiracy is to undermine peace and enslave the people of Asian and African countries.
	All the people of Vietnam are determined to unite closely to oppose these conspiracies. This is a very arduous struggle. But this is a just struggle for peace, unification, and independence, for the realization of the legitimate aspirations of the Vietnamese people and all people. The reason why this struggle will be able to mobilize the potential strength of all the people of Vietnam, and the reason why this struggle will win the sympathy of the people of all Asian and African countries and the people of the world who love peace, is because of this.
	Today, the Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are contributing to the struggle for the peace, unification, independence, and democracy of Vietnam, for the independence of oppressed countries and the equality of all countries, for the peace and security of Asia, Africa, and the world, and for peaceful coexistence and cooperation among countries. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has the honor to welcome the Asian-African Conference.
	The Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam thank the initiating countries for inviting the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to participate in the Asian-African Conference. They sincerely thank the Government and people of Indonesia for the warm and gracious hospitality extended to the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    范文同向亚非会议提出声明
    新华社万隆二十一日讯　亚非会议新闻委员会二十一日发表越南民主共和国出席亚非会议代表团团长、越南民主共和国副总理兼外交部长范文同二十日提交亚非会议的声明，声明全文如下：主席先生，各位代表，
    今天越南民主共和国代表团很高兴地代表越南人民和越南民主共和国政府向亚非会议和参加会议的全体代表团表示最热烈的祝贺。
    我们在祝贺这个具有历史意义的集会的时候，我们是在祝贺亿万亚非人民不可抗拒的兴起。我们祝贺亚非人民的大团结。我们欢呼亚非人民在当代国际舞台上发挥的重大作用。
    这次亚非会议充满着重大的历史意义。
    代表着亚非人民对和平的愿望和意志的亚非会议决心要维持和巩固和平，同时它要坚决保卫争取独立和平等的民族权利。它将是对亚洲和非洲以及全世界的和平事业的一个伟大的贡献。它将成为具有不同社会制度的国家之间和平共处的基础。它将成为亚非国家之间以及同全世界其他国家发展友好合作关系的基础。
    亚非国家都是具有丰富资源的国家。它们有着天赋的丰富而珍贵的矿藏，广大而肥沃的平原，蕴藏着极珍贵的林产宝藏的无穷无尽的森林与山脉和有着无限水产资源的漫长的海岸线。我们的财富是世界上最珍贵的财富中的一部分，这些财富足以保证我们地区的人民过富裕而幸福的生活。亚非地区是有人类居住的地区的最优秀和最古老的文明——像中国、印度、阿拉伯、埃及以及其他亚非文明——的摇篮。它们照亮了全人类。我们的文化成就是世界著名的，并且永远成为亚非人民的光辉的过去的明证。我们的许多发现仍然是人类智慧和劳动的最卓越的业绩，而且是最宝贵的科学遗产的一部分。
    但是，在过去几个世纪中，亚非人民一直遭受着殖民统治的痛苦。由于各方面所受的非人剥削，他们一直过着极其悲惨的生活。
    民族独立受到压制，民主自由受到禁止，作为人的生存和生活的权利受到漠视，他们所有的潜能都受到抑制而不得发挥，他们的地位和威望被贬低了，他们的进步受到阻碍。
    由于殖民主义，我们各个国家曾经变成殖民地、半殖民地和没有正当权利的国家，它们被剥夺了自决的权利和在国际大家庭中占有它们的地位的权利。
    但是，亚非国家已经恢复了或正在恢复它们的民族独立、民族主权和领土完整。
    我们在这里的人都是具有不同社会制度和在见解上有许多不同的国家的代表。正是这些不同反而更加显现了我们共同的感情：所有我们各国人民和政府争取和平和独立的愿望。
    这些共同的感情已经使我们聚会在这里。我们的会议就是亚非国家和平共处和在和平共处原则的指导下一起工作的意愿的表现。
    我们正在亚非人民和世界各国人民面前担负着一项重大的责任：我们的责任就是使这次聚会获得很大的成就。我们的会议本身应该是一个和平共处的榜样，而且它应该促成我们这些国家之间的和平共处，从而促进世界各国人民之间的和平共处。
    越南民主共和国能够参加这次会议感到非常高兴，它保证要尽最大的努力，以求对这次会议的成功和对亚非国家人民的友谊与和平事业作出贡献。
    这次会议需要解决一些非常重要的问题。越南民主共和国代表团希望说明一下越南民主共和国人民和政府对这些问题的态度：第一，这次会议的主要任务是以明确无误和有力的方式表明亚洲和非洲国家的人民要在他们自己之间和同世界上其他国家的人民之间保持和平共处的意志、他们维护和巩固和平的决心以及坚决反对一切战争阴谋的态度。
    亚非人民从来没有挑起过战争。他们在战争方面没有任何既得利益。他们是发生在他们领土上的许多次战争的牺牲者。亚非土地时常成为鲜血遍地的战场，亚非青年时常变成了炮灰。许多无辜的平民受到屠杀，许多庙宇、宝塔、教堂、学校和文化场所化为灰烬。许多亚洲人和非洲人的家庭还在悲悼他们心爱的人，许多亚洲和非洲的城镇和乡村仍然显露着尚未复原的战争创伤。第一次的原子弹投在亚洲的领土上，亚洲人成了原子弹和氢弹试验的牺牲者，难道这还不够吗？
    今天，当我们聚集在这里的时候，战争的炮声正在亚非两洲的某些地方隆隆地震响；军事侵略集团正在建立，这种集团严重地危害着亚洲、非洲和全世界人民的和平和安全。
    今天，原子武器和氢武器的毁坏力已使每一个人确信只有一条道路可走：和平共处的道路。另一方面，原子能用于和平建设的首次尝试的成功，已经展开了人类从未梦想到的最光辉的前景。
    因此，亚非人民对于战争感到无限的痛恨和厌恶。他们对和平抱有最深切的希望，他们坚决要为维护和平而斗争。
    越南人民属于亚非地区，他们曾经经历了长时期战争的痛苦。日内瓦会议替他们带来了十五年来第一次的和平。因此越南人民同亚非人民一起，坚决反对一切战争阴谋、一切侵略性的军事条约和原子战争，要求停止制造原子武器和氢武器，销毁一切原子弹和氢弹，并且衷心支持和平使用原子能，以提高各国人民的物质和文化水平。
    第二，对亚非人民以及对全世界各国人民来说，和平生活同民族独立和各国人民平等是分不开的。如果各国人民仍然受外国侵略者统治，如果仍然有领土为外国侵略者所占领，如果既没有民族独立，也没有民族主权，那么就不可能有真正的和平。
    今天打算破坏和平的人，正是那些试图用幕后活动的办法来奴役亚洲和非洲人民的侵略者。历史事实证明：只要是殖民主义统治亚非国家一天，这些国家就只是炮灰、奴隶劳工和战争原料的供应者。它们成了帝国主义国家的工具。它们的土地变成了血腥的战场。
    但是由于和平是人民的热烈愿望，只要亚非国家争取到它们的独立、平等待遇的权利和决定它们自己命运的权利，那么它们就要尽它们最大的力量维护和平。只有在这个时候，和平才成为真正的和稳固的和平。
    因此，对亚非人民来说，维护和平、反对战争的斗争，是和反对侵略成性的帝国主义、争取民族独立的斗争，是和反对种族歧视、争取各民族平等的斗争一致的。
    由于越南人民进行了艰苦的斗争来恢复他们自己的民族独立和重建他们的和平生活，由于他们得到了亚非人民以及全世界人民的同情和支持，所以他们热心地支持亚非人民反对侵略成性的帝国主义、争取民族独立、争取各民族一律平等和过和平生活的一切斗争。
    今天，这种斗争在许多国家里，在不同的形式下进行着。
    越南人民全力支持中国人民争取恢复领土完整的斗争和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国争取统一的斗争。越南人民有力地要求在尊重领土完整和各国人民的独立、平等权利的基础上解决像西伊里安、果阿、马来亚、怯尼亚这样的问题和其他类似的问题。他们全心全意地支持非洲人民的解放运动。越南人民要求彻底废除亚洲、非洲和全世界的殖民主义和种族主义，并且要求外国部队全部从亚洲和非洲撤退。他们坚决反对任何外国以任何方式直接或间接地干涉亚非国家的内政。亚非国家人民要求持久和稳定的和平，要求民族独立和各国人民之间平等的权利，因为他们希望建设幸福、繁荣的生活。要达到这个目的，一个必要的条件就是亚非国家人民之间的团结、友谊和各方面的亲密关系。在亚非国家的历史中，广泛的文化交流和商业往来，证明是每一个国家进步和所有亚非国家全面发展和进步的推动力。殖民主义和战争打断了这种古老的、宝贵的接触，树立了隔离的壁垒，制造了种族仇恨，阻止了一切经济和文化交流。最近几年以来强迫实施的禁运就是一个明显的证明，这种禁运已经严重损害了亚非国家和全世界的经济发展。自从第二次世界大战结束以来，和民族解放运动同时，亚非国家之间的关系也得到了恢复并且一直在发展。一九五四年六月，中华人民共和国总理和印度共和国总理共同宣布了和平共处的五项原则，以后，又和缅甸联邦总理共同宣布了这些原则。这是一个历史性的宣言，它在亚、非两洲开辟了一个新的纪元，亚非国家在维护和平和争取民族独立的共同斗争中友好和合作的新纪元。从那时以来，许多亚非国家相继出来支持这些原则，亚非的团结已经成为事实，这种团结意味着亚非人民的觉醒。
    我们亚洲和非洲国家是人力和原料的巨大的源泉。但是殖民主义和破坏性战争阻碍了我们经济的进展。
    这就说明了为什么我们目前感觉到需要扩大亚非国家之间以及世界各国之间的经济交流和经济合作，以便充分发展我们的经济潜力和建立一种繁荣的经济，从而提高人民的生活水平。
    扩大我们国家之间的文化交流，是发扬我们的文化遗产和加强我们人民之间的友谊的先决条件。
    越南人民和越南民主共和国政府完全支持根据和平共处五项原则，来扩大和加强亚非国家之间的各方面的关系。
    越南人民在过去和现在所进行的争取和平、统一、独立和民主的斗争是完全符合于这次会议的宗旨和目的的。
    越南人民所进行的历时八年多的长期艰苦的爱国战争，是争取和平和民族独立的斗争，它引起了深远的反响。它获得了全世界人民的同情和支持，特别是亚洲和非洲人民的同情和支持；它取得了两次重大的胜利，一次在奠边府，一次在日内瓦。
    日内瓦会议是越南、柬埔寨和老挝人民的重大胜利。同时也是对和平、对被压迫人民的斗争的一个伟大的贡献。
    日内瓦协定明确地规定了关于结束印度支那战争和恢复和平的必要条款。日内瓦协定也规定了关于巩固和平和防止战争再起的必要条款。那就是禁止运入新的武器和军事人员，禁止在印度支那建立外国军事基地，禁止利用印度支那的土地达到侵略的目的，并禁止印度支那国家参加任何军事同盟。
    实施日内瓦协定，不仅将巩固和平，而且也将缓和亚洲、非洲和世界其他地方的紧张局势。
    日内瓦协定和日内瓦会议最后宣言，对越南、柬埔寨和老挝实现民族独立及国家主权、统一和领土完整给予了正式承认，并且规定了切实可行的步骤。出席日内瓦会议的所有国家，曾经保证尊重印度支那人民的合法权利，保证不干涉印度支那国家的内政，并且坚信越南、柬埔寨和老挝从此能够完全独立自主地在和平的国际大家庭中充分起它们的作用。
    因此，日内瓦协定是迄今最明确和最清楚地承认了争取民族解放的弱小的和被压迫民族的要求的第一个国际协定，它符合一切被剥夺权利和被压迫的民族的最珍贵的愿望。
    正是因为日内瓦协定是和平力量的一个重大胜利和民族解放运动的一个重大胜利，所以全世界人民，特别是亚洲和非洲人民热烈地欢呼日内瓦协定，把它看作是自己的胜利。亚洲和非洲国家的所有领袖、政府和舆论一致欢迎和支持日内瓦协定并要求所有有关方面彻底和正确地履行协定的所有条款。
    日内瓦会议后，越南的斗争进入了一个新的阶段，其目的在于彻底履行停战协定，巩固和平，争取全国统一、独立和民主。这种斗争同时也是维护亚洲、非洲和全世界和平、发展民族解放运动的胜利、使协定中已经被承认的小国取得完全的民族权利的斗争。
    越南人民已经在十分困难的条件下正确地履行了目的在于结束战争和恢复和平的条款。
    越南人民要和平。他们已经在日内瓦会议上恢复了和平。他们决心为巩固这个已经恢复的和平而斗争。他们需要和平，以便重建他们被十五年的战争所破坏了的经济，并重建他们的国家，消灭殖民主义和封建主义的痕迹和继续提高人民的物质与文化水平。这是一个众所周知的事实。这就说明为什么所谓越南民主共和国政府在日内瓦会议后增加了好几个师的武装力量的谰言是完全没有根据的，并且遭到了受权人士的断然驳斥。
    双方军队撤到它们各自的集结区所规定的三百天期限已将近结束。一个新的时期即将开始，在这个时期中，关于通过自由的普选来统一越南的问题必须加以解决。越南是一个统一的国家，任何人都不能分裂它。在越南的历史、地理、经济、文化、语言和风俗习惯中都贯穿着统一这两个字的印痕。它们深深地刻在越南的土地上和从北部到南部的全体越南人民的心中。在目前，争取统一的斗争是全体越南人民的神圣的斗争。越南民主共和国政府已经宣布，为了给北部和南部当局于一九五五年七月举行协商会议作好准备，它愿意恢复北部和南部之间的所有的正常关系，作为取得越南统一的第一步，同时它也宣布它愿意同南部当局进行接触。在这方面，胡志明主席在新年宣布：“我们准备真诚地团结任何希望和平、统一、独立和民主的个人和团体。”所有这些事实都说明了越南人民和越南民主共和国的真诚、现实精神和善意。
    越南人民和越南民主共和国政府决心要严格地和充分地履行日内瓦协定。这就说明了他们为什么始终同国际监督和监察委员会进行紧密的合作，并且给委员会以一切协助，以帮助它完成它的任务。
    老挝和柬埔寨是越南的两个邻邦。它们和越南一样，是一定会充分履行保证越南、老挝和柬埔寨人民的民族权利的日内瓦协定的。越南民主共和国政府不止一次地宣布它愿意根据和平共处五项原则同老挝和柬埔寨王国政府建立关系。
    越南民主共和国政府还希望而且愿意尽它最大的努力，根据这五项原则发展它同亚非国家——特别是同印度、缅甸和印度尼西亚——的友谊和各方面的关系。
    至于法国，越南民主共和国政府愿意在尊重越南民主共和国的主权的基础上并根据平等互利的原则来同它恢复外交、经济和文化关系。
    越南民主共和国将努力发展它同友好国家、特别是同中华人民共和国之间的兄弟关系和各方面的密切联系。中华人民共和国和旧中国截然不同，正如光明和黑暗截然不同一样，它是坚决争取自己的民族权利、同时也争取不论远近大小所有国家的民族权利的一个世界强国，它是同印度共和国一起最先提出五项原则的国家，这五项原则是：互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利及和平共处。
    上述一切都证明了越南人民和越南民主共和国政府的诚恳态度、现实精神和争取和平的意志。
    但是在印度支那和平恢复后不久，一直在策划继续和扩大印度支那战争的侵略成性的帝国主义者，却致力于组织反对日内瓦协议的军事集团，在他们将把南越、柬埔寨和老挝包括进去的所谓“保护地区”之内，他们曾试图用尽最大力量扩大他们对南部内政的干涉，建立新的军事基地，并把新武器和军事人员运往南越。
    镇压民主自由，扼杀南越人民要求和平和统一的意愿，在南部制造目前的纠纷，从而破坏治安和威胁人民的和平生存，都是他们一手造成的。他们的最恶毒的阴谋之一就是诱骗和强迫一部分的人民，特别是天主教徒到南部去，以便为他们新成立的军队提供士兵，为他们的橡胶园提供劳工。他们这样做，也是为了阻挠北越的经济复兴和和平建设。同时，他们还试图在世界上煽动起不利于越南民主共和国的舆论，从而实现他们破坏日内瓦协议的黑暗的阴谋。
    他们采用了这样的宣传手段：上帝已到南方去了，留在北越的人们不仅将失去他们的灵魂，而且还将死在美国人在北越投掷的原子弹下。这是一个令人痛心的事实：有一些人民，虽然留恋他们的家乡，忠实于越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席，但是他们决定到南部去，因为他们害怕失去灵魂，怕死在原子弹下。除了欺骗之外，他们还用了各种各样的胁迫的办法，强迫人民到南部去。
    在日内瓦协定签订之后，越南民主共和国政府就宣布，愿意到南部去的人可以自由到南部去。
    这样人们就能够理解为什么有人到南部去。他们之所以去，是因为他们受到了欺骗和胁迫，而不是因为他们喜欢南部的政权而不喜欢北部的政权。人们可能问：为什么没有人离开南部到北部去呢？这是因为越南民主共和国政府不鼓励这种流动。越南民主共和国政府认为越南的公民，不论他们居住在北部或居住在南部，都是居住在自己的祖国，都是团结在争取和平与领土统一的共同斗争中的。像绝大多数的外国记者所注意到的那样，全体越南人民，包括那些居住在南越的在内，他们的心都是向着胡志明主席的，他是统一和独立的越南的活的象征。
    这是没有人能掩盖的真理。
    为了使北部和南部之间的关系恢复正常，越南民主共和国政府已经在它的权限范围内，宣布那些愿意到南部去的人可以完全自由地流动。可是，由于南越当局所造成的困难，北部和南部之间的流动仍然受着限制。
    侵略性的帝国主义者的上述一切的活动都是彰明昭著地违反日内瓦协定的，这些活动的目的是要扰乱印度支那的和平，破坏越南以及柬埔寨和老挝的民族独立和主权，并侵犯这些国家的领土完整。这些活动是在亚洲、非洲和全世界制造新的紧张局势的整个阴谋的一部分，而这个阴谋的目的就是要破坏和平，奴役亚非各国人民。
    越南全体人民决心紧密地团结起来，反对这些阴谋。这是一个非常艰巨的斗争。但是这是一个争取和平、统一和独立、争取实现越南人民以及所有人民的正当愿望的正义斗争。这个斗争之所以将能动员越南全体人民的潜在的力量，这个斗争之所以将博得所有亚非国家的人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民的同情，其原因就在于此。
    今天，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府正在为争取越南的和平、统一、独立和民主而斗争，为争取被压迫国家的独立和所有国家一律平等，为争取亚洲、非洲和全世界的和平和安全，为争取各国间的和平共处和合作的斗争作出贡献。越南民主共和国代表团有荣幸对亚非会议表示欢迎。
    越南人民和越南民主共和国政府感谢发起国家邀请越南民主共和国政府参加亚非会议。他们诚挚地感谢印度尼西亚政府和人民给予越南民主共和国代表团的热烈的和殷勤的招待。
