Title: The Key Lies in People

In the state-owned food commercial system, there's a strange argument going around, saying things like: fresh eggs are so delicate, live pigs are so difficult to transport, and fruit is so easy to rot; therefore, it's unavoidable that eggs will stink, pigs will die, and fruit will rot.

Of course, this argument isn't entirely without reason, and one can even find quite a few factual "bases" for it. For example, this February, of the two batches of fresh eggs transferred from Binghui County Food Company, Anhui Province, to Beijing, more than twenty-four percent were skin-stuck eggs, water-injected eggs, and rotten eggs.

However, no matter what, this is only a one-sided phenomenon. It's not as if buying or transporting eggs *has* to result in rotting. The egg product team at the Libao purchasing station of the Jiangsu Provincial Food Company took in over 80,000 jin of fresh eggs in 1954, with zero spoilage.

So, where does the key to rotting or not rotting lie? Let's first take a look at how the Binghui County Food Company treats eggs. They use bamboo baskets of very poor quality to pack the eggs. After being transported to Beijing, some of the egg baskets were already squeezed out of shape and broken. The bamboo pieces used to make the basket lids could not withstand pressure and couldn't prevent rainwater from seeping in. The egg product team at the Libao purchasing station is different. Whenever farmers come to sell eggs, the weighers help them pick them up gently. They put the collected eggs into clean, dry baskets, and try to transport them as soon as they are collected. During the rainy season, they use one-foot-high wooden blocks to pad the bottom of the baskets, and in winter, they pay attention to keeping them warm, paying attention to storage at all times. This naturally makes it possible to achieve zero spoilage throughout the year.

Isn't the problem already very obvious? All eggs in the world are fragile, and the management of food is difficult. The key lies in what attitude the management staff takes towards their work. However, some leading cadres emphasize that the storage workers are already suffering enough, the country is so big, there are so many people, and it is not easy to grasp the plan, etc., and therefore advocate giving more praise and less criticism to the storage personnel. This indulgent attitude towards cadres in charge of storage and transportation is actually a criminal act that damages national wealth. The "bacon catastrophe," "large-scale credit sales of oranges," and the losses suffered by food companies in many regions, as reflected in various places, are precisely caused by this erroneous thinking.

Cadres in the state-owned food commercial system should learn from the specific examples of the Binghui County Food Company in Anhui Province and the Libao purchasing station of the Jiangsu Provincial Food Company. They should no longer allow national wealth to suffer undue losses under the guise of various objective reasons, so that the vast number of people can eat fresh eggs, pork, fruit...

    关键在人
    牟澜
    在国营食品商业系统的干部中，有这样一种怪论调，说什么：鲜蛋那末娇嫩、生猪那末难运、水果那末易烂；因此，蛋臭、猪死、水果烂，就是在所难免。
    当然这种论调不是完全没有道理的，甚至还可以找到不少的事实“根据”，例如今年二月间，从安徽省炳辉县食品公司先后调来北京的两批鲜蛋，其中有百分之二十四以上是贴皮蛋、水灌蛋和臭蛋。
    可是，无论如何，这还只是片面的现象。并不是收购或装运鸡蛋都非烂不可。江苏省食品公司李堡收购站蛋品组，一九五四年全年收进八万多斤鲜蛋，却没有损耗。
    那么，烂与不烂的关键何在呢？让我们先看一看炳辉县食品公司怎样对待鸡蛋的。他们用质量很次的竹篓装蛋，运到北京后，有些蛋篓已经挤歪挤坏了，竹篓用竹片编成篓盖，也经不起压和挡不住雨水渗入。李堡收购站蛋品组却不是这样，每当农民来卖蛋，司磅员就帮助他们轻轻地检拾。把收来的鸡蛋，装入洁净、干燥的篓内，尽量做到随收随运。在霉雨季节，他们用一尺多高的枕木垫在篓底，冬天注意保温，时刻注意保管。这样自然就能做到全年无损。
    问题不是已经很明显了吗？天下的鸡蛋都是易碎的，食品的经营管理都是有困难的。关键只在管理工作人员用什么态度对待自己的工作。可是有些领导干部，他们强调保管工作干部已经够苦了，国家这末大，人那末多，掌握计划不容易等等，因而主张对保管人员要多加表扬、少用批评。对保管运输工作干部的这种姑息态度，实际上是损害国家财富的犯罪行为。各地反映的“腊肉成灾”、“桔柑大赊销”和很多地区的食品公司赔本，也正是由于这种错误思想所造成的。
    国营食品商业系统的干部，应该从安徽省炳辉县食品公司和江苏省食品公司李堡收购站的具体事例，来吸取教训，不要再在各种客观原因的掩饰下，再使国家的财富受到不应有的损失，使广大人民能吃到新鲜的鸡蛋、猪肉、水果……。
