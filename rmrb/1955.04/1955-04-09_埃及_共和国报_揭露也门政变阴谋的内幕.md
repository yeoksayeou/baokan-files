    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 7th (TASS dispatch): "Al-Gomhuria" published certain detailed circumstances of the coup plot that occurred in Yemen. The newspaper said that this plot was "a foreign concoction." The newspaper said that the imperialists did not like the policies of the current Yemeni ruler, Ahmed, and therefore decided to replace him with their servant, Abdullah.
    "Al-Gomhuria" pointed out that Ahmed defends the independence of his country, opposes joining foreign pacts, and cherishes cooperation with other Arab countries. He safeguards the territorial integrity of the nation and "opposes the constant acts of aggression by the British colonial authorities in Aden."
    The newspaper continued that Abdullah (holding the position of Foreign Minister), instigated by the British, opposed Ahmed's policy of refusing to join foreign pacts together with Egypt. Britain convinced Abdullah that Yemen should not oppose the Turkish-Iraqi pact, and that he should seize the throne himself.
    "Al-Gomhuria" then reported that Abdullah was arrested before he could flee abroad. Abdullah's designated Prime Minister—Abdullah's brother Abbas—was also arrested. The commander of the rebels, Colonel Ahmed Talaya, was sentenced to death.

    埃及“共和国报”
    揭露也门政变阴谋的内幕
    新华社八日讯　塔斯社开罗七日讯：“共和国报”刊载了也门发生政变阴谋的某些详细情节。报纸说，这个阴谋是“外国人干的勾当”。报纸说，帝国主义不喜欢也门现任执政者艾哈迈德的政策，于是决定使他们的仆从阿卜杜拉代替他。
    “共和国报”指出，艾哈迈德捍卫自己祖国的独立，反对参加外国公约，珍视同其他阿拉伯国家的合作。他维护国家的领土完整，“反对在亚丁的英国殖民当局的不断的侵略行动”。
    报纸继续写道，英国唆使下的阿卜杜拉（担任外交大臣职务）反对艾哈迈德执行同埃及一起拒绝参加外国公约的政策。英国使阿卜杜拉相信也门不应该反对土耳其—伊拉克条约，而且他应该自己占据王位。
    “共和国报”接着报道，阿卜杜拉没有能够逃往国外，就被逮捕了。阿卜杜拉内定的首相——阿卜杜拉的兄弟阿巴斯也被逮捕了。叛军司令艾哈迈德·塔莱亚上校被判处死刑。
