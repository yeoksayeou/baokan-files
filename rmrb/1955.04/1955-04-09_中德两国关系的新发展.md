    New Developments in Sino-German Relations

    Chairman Mao Zedong issued an order on April 7, announcing the end of the state of war between the People's Republic of China and Germany. This is a major event of historical significance in Sino-German relations.

    China declared a state of war with Germany on December 9, 1941. At that time, China was in a deep national disaster; under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our people were waging a just national liberation war against the Japanese aggressors. As everyone knows, the Japanese militarists' aggression against China was encouraged and supported by Hitler's Germany. Fascist Germany and militarist Japan formed an alliance of aggression, ignited the flames of war in Europe and the Far East, and dragged billions of people in the world into the catastrophe of war. Therefore, German fascism was not only the enemy of the European people, but also the enemy of the Chinese people.

    Thanks to the tenacious struggle of peace-loving people all over the world, especially the heroic struggle of the Soviet people, the victory of the anti-fascist war was finally achieved, which fundamentally changed the world situation, and the situation between China and Germany also underwent fundamental changes. Hitler's fascist Germany was eliminated, and the German Democratic Republic under the leadership of President Wilhelm Pieck emerged; the backward old China, which had been bullied and enslaved by imperialism for a long time, no longer existed, and an independent and strong People's Republic of China emerged. The German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China are two fraternal countries born in 1949. Since then, the relations between China and Germany have embarked on a new stage. In the common struggle to defend world peace, and in various activities to develop mutual trade relations and cultural exchanges, the friendly unity between the two peoples is developing and consolidating day by day.

    However, although the state apparatus of Nazi Germany under Hitler's rule has long ceased to exist, and the war against German fascism ended nearly ten years ago, the peace treaty expressing the end of the state of war between relevant countries and Germany has not yet been concluded. The reason for this abnormal phenomenon is that the US-British ruling clique has brutally violated the Potsdam Agreement after the war and is implementing the heinous policy of splitting Germany and rearming West Germany. The purpose of the US-British ruling clique's policy towards Germany is to make Germany once again a breeding ground for war in Europe, and to make the people of West Germany the cannon fodder in their future war against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. It is precisely for this purpose that the Western countries have adopted an attitude of rejection or evasion towards the various proposals put forward by the Soviet Union time and again to resolve the German question, draft and conclude a peace treaty with Germany, and establish a European collective security system. The signing and ratification of the Paris Agreements further prove that the ruling cliques of the United States, Britain, and France are determined to further deepen the division of Germany and greatly intensify the situation in Europe.

    Facts have proved that the United States, Britain, and France have consistently violated and undermined international agreements on resolving the German question; the Soviet Union has always made unremitting efforts to achieve the unification of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis. Even after the Western countries signed the Paris Agreements, the Soviet Union still took new peaceful measures on the German question. This is the order issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on January 25 this year, announcing the end of the state of war between the Soviet Union and Germany. This significant action shows that the Soviet Union sincerely hopes that Germany will become a fully sovereign, peaceful, democratic, and unified country. The Soviet government's measures not only take into account the interests of the people of East Germany, but also the interests of the people of West Germany, and have therefore won the enthusiastic support of the entire German people. Subsequently, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other European people's democratic countries also took the same measures to restore peaceful relations with Germany.

    The state of war between our country and Germany has also been declared over since the publication of Chairman Mao Zedong's order. Chairman Mao Zedong's order embodies the Chinese people's concern for European peace and security. Today, the US imperialists are recklessly reviving German militarism in Europe, handing over weapons to West German revanchists, and dragging it into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, greatly increasing the danger of a new war; in the East, they are implementing a policy of rearming Japan, establishing a Southeast Asian military alliance, and forcibly occupying our territory of Taiwan. The aggressive policies pursued by US imperialism in Europe and the East are intended to restore the breeding ground for new wars in these two regions, so that, like the military alliance of fascist Germany and militarist Japan in those years, new wars of aggression can be provoked in Europe and Asia. Historical experience tells the Chinese people that the peace of Europe and the peace of Asia are indivisible. The struggle against the US revival of German militarism, against the implementation of the Paris Agreements, against the rearmament of Japan, and against the US occupation of Taiwan is the common task of all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world. In today's order, Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out: "The People's Republic of China firmly supports the German Democratic Republic and the entire German people, as well as the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries and peoples, in their struggle to achieve the peaceful unification of Germany, promote the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, guarantee European collective security, and safeguard world peace." The German people are by no means isolated. Their struggle to prevent the implementation of the Paris Agreements and their efforts to restore German unity on a peaceful and democratic basis have the full support of the 600 million Chinese people.

    Chairman Mao Zedong's order also marks a new development in Sino-German relations. The order itself is a vivid proof of the further development of friendly relations between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic. Today, both the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic are committed to socialist construction, and this great cause requires further strengthening of economic, cultural, and all-round cooperation between the two countries. The mutual support between China and Germany in socialist construction, and the further development of the deep friendship between the two peoples, are of great significance for consolidating and strengthening the world peace forces led by the Soviet Union. With the end of the state of hostility between our country and Germany, it can be asserted that the Chinese people and the entire German people will unite more closely in the common struggle to defend peace; the friendship between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic, two fraternal countries, will be further developed.

### 中德两国关系的新发展

    中德两国关系的新发展
    毛泽东主席四月七日发布命令，宣布结束中华人民共和国同德国之间的战争状态。这是中德两国关系中具有历史意义的重大事件。
    中国是在一九四一年十二月九日宣布同德国处于战争状态的。当时的情况是，中国正处于深重的民族灾难之中；我国人民在中国共产党的领导下，对日本侵略者进行着正义的民族解放战争。人所共知，日本军国主义对中国的侵略，是得到希特勒德国的鼓励和支持的。法西斯德国和军国主义日本结成侵略同盟，在欧洲和远东燃起战火，把世界上十几亿人民拖入战争的浩劫。因此，德国法西斯不仅是欧洲人民的敌人，也是中国人民的敌人。
    由于全世界爱好和平的人民的顽强斗争，特别是由于苏联人民的英勇奋斗，终于取得了反法西斯战争的胜利，这就使世界形势发生了根本的改变，中国同德国的情况也发生了根本的变化。希特勒的法西斯德国被消灭了，出现了威廉·皮克总统领导下的德意志民主共和国；遭受帝国主义长期欺凌奴役的落后的旧中国不再存在了，出现了独立的强大的中华人民共和国。德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国，都是在一九四九年诞生的两个兄弟国家。从此以后，中德两国的关系就走上了一个新的阶段。在保卫世界和平的共同斗争中，在发展相互之间的贸易关系和文化交流的各种活动中，两国人民的友好团结，正在日益发展和巩固。
    但是，尽管希特勒统治下的纳粹德国的国家机构早已不再存在，反对德国法西斯的战争结束了将近十年，表示结束有关国家间战争状态的对德和约，却至今没有缔结。这种不正常的现象所以发生，是由于美英统治集团在战后粗暴地违背了波茨坦协定，执行着分裂德国、重新武装西德的罪恶政策。美英统治集团对德政策的目的，是要使德国再一次变成欧洲战争的策源地，使西德人民成为它们未来的反苏、反人民民主国家战争中的炮灰。正是为了这个目的，西方国家对于苏联一再提出的解决德国问题、起草和缔结对德和约、建立欧洲集体安全体系的种种建议，一概采取拒绝或规避的态度。巴黎协定的签订和批准，更证明了美国和英法的统治集团，还决意进一步加深德国的分裂，使欧洲局势大大地紧张起来。
    事实证明，美、英、法一贯地违背和破坏有关解决德国问题的国际协议；苏联则始终不渝地为争取在和平民主的基础上统一德国而努力。即使在西方国家签订了巴黎协定之后，苏联仍然在德国问题上采取新的和平措施。这就是今年一月二十五日，苏联最高苏维埃主席团发布命令，宣布结束苏联和德国之间的战争状态。这一具有重大意义的行动，说明苏联衷心地希望德国成为一个具有完全主权的、和平民主和统一的国家。苏联政府的措施不仅照顾到东德人民的利益，同时也考虑到西德人民的利益，因而获得了全德人民的热烈支持。随后，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和其他欧洲人民民主国家，也都采取了同样的措施，同德国恢复了和平关系。
    我国和德国之间的战争状态，在毛泽东主席的命令公布以后，也从此宣告结束了。毛泽东主席的命令，体现了中国人民对于欧洲和平和安全的关切。美帝国主义者今天甘冒天下之大不韪，在欧洲蓄意复活德国军国主义，把武器交给西德的复仇主义者，并把它拉进北大西洋侵略集团，使新战争的危险大大增加；在东方则执行重新武装日本的政策，建立东南亚军事同盟，并以武力侵占我国领土台湾。美帝国主义在欧洲和东方所推行的侵略政策，是想在这两个地区恢复新战争的温床，以便像当年的法西斯德国和军国主义日本的军事同盟一样，在欧洲和亚洲挑起新的侵略战争。历史的经验告诉中国人民，欧洲的和平和亚洲的和平，是不可分割的。反对美国复活德国军国主义、反对实施巴黎协定的斗争，反对重新武装日本、反对美国侵占台湾的斗争，是全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的共同任务。毛泽东主席在今天公布的命令中指出：“中华人民共和国坚决支持德意志民主共和国和全德人民以及苏联和所有爱好和平的国家和人民为争取德国和平统一、促进对德和约缔结、保障欧洲集体安全和维护世界和平的斗争。”德国人民决不是孤立的。他们为阻止巴黎协定实施的斗争，为在和平民主的基础上恢复德国统一的努力，有着中国六亿人民的全力支持。
    毛泽东主席的命令也标志着中德两国关系的新发展。这一命令的本身，就是中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国之间友谊关系进一步发展的生动证明。中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国今天都致力于社会主义建设，这一伟大的事业要求两国之间经济、文化和各方面的合作进一步地加强。中德两国在社会主义建设方面的互相支援，两国人民之间深厚友谊的更加发展，对于巩固和增强以苏联为首的世界和平力量，具有重大的意义。随着我国和德国之间敌对状态的结束，可以断言，中国人民和全德国人民在保卫和平的共同斗争中，将会更紧密地团结起来；中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国两个兄弟国家的友谊将更得到进一步的发展。
