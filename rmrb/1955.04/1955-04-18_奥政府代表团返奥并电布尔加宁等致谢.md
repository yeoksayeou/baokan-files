    Xinhua News Agency Report: The Austrian government delegation, headed by Austrian Prime Minister Raab, returned to Vienna from Moscow on the 15th.

    Austrian Prime Minister Raab made a statement at the airport. He said: The Austrian delegation brought back good news. Our hopes and expectations of the past decade are about to become a reality: we are about to be free. Those prisoners of war and civilians who are still detained in Russia and cannot return to their homeland will also be free. We will regain our wealth—the oil in Lower Austria. We will recover the Danube Shipping Company, and all the enterprises known as "USIA Enterprises." Therefore, we have achieved complete success, and we will strive to lead the Austrian people to peace. The talks held in the Soviet capital are of great significance not only to Austria and the Soviet Union. This meeting is undoubtedly a valuable contribution to the cause of world peace. The Austrian people long for peace. We hope to work peacefully as an independent people for our people and our future.

    Furthermore, Austrian Federal Chancellor Raab and Vice-Chancellor Schärf sent a telegram to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin and First Deputy Chairman and Foreign Minister Molotov, expressing their gratitude for the hospitality they received in Moscow. The telegram also pointed out that this Soviet-Austrian meeting will contribute to the cause of peace.
