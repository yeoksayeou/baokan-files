German People Welcome the Asian-African Conference
Georgy Handke, State Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic

    Official delegations from the governments of twenty-nine Asian and African countries have gathered in Bandung, Indonesia, to participate in the significant Asian-African Conference, which is scheduled to open today.

    The central issues of this conference are the defense and consolidation of peace, opposition to colonialism and racial discrimination, and economic construction and development. Therefore, the Bandung Conference is of great significance not only to Asia and Africa but also to the whole world.

    The Bandung Conference is a clear example of how countries with different political and social systems can peacefully negotiate together on issues such as defending peace, independence and equality, and peaceful coexistence among all peoples. This is why the Bandung Conference is not only warmly welcomed by the peoples of Asia and Africa but also enthusiastically supported by all peace-loving forces around the world.

    We, the German people, also pay close and sympathetic attention to the efforts of the Asian and African people to safeguard peace, strive for national independence, and organize peaceful cooperation.

    The German Democratic Republic—the first peace-loving and democratic German state—whose foreign policy aims to defend peace in Europe and establish a unified, peace-loving, democratic, and independent Germany, supports the freedom struggles of the Asian and African people and their efforts to consolidate peace.

    The Asian-African Conference vividly reflects the changes in the Asian situation. The people of Asia and Africa are determined to break free from the shackles of colonialism and live in an environment free from foreign supervision and interference. This conference will surely lead the national liberation and independence movements in Asia and Africa to further heights.

    The fact that the countries participating in the conference represent nearly two-thirds of the world's population shows the great significance of the conference. The holding of the Bandung Conference is inseparable from the development of China.

    The great Chinese people's victory, which is of world-historical significance, has awakened the Asian people to fight to liberate their countries from colonial rule and to strive for national sovereignty. For the oppressed people of Asia and Africa, the free struggles of the People's Republic of China and the people of Vietnam and Korea are shining examples of implementing the people's free will. The situation in India is also of great significance. India is no longer a colonial country today. The Republic of India is an important factor for peace and friendship among peoples in the Asian region. In addition to India, Indonesia and Burma have also broken free from colonial rule. The establishment of friendly and good-neighborly relations between the People's Republic of China, India, and Burma has a significant impact on the situation in Asia. The joint declaration of these countries on establishing relations with all countries on the basis of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence has received widespread response in Asia, Africa, and other continents. Peace-loving people today have the right to ask this question: Why can't the governments and parliaments of all countries recognize and uphold these principles?

    The suggestion to hold the Bandung Conference naturally greatly disturbed the imperialist countries. The American "Chicago Sun-Times" wrote: "The Eisenhower government considers the upcoming Asian-African Conference to be extremely unwelcome." Initially, the imperialists tried to minimize the significance of the Asian-African Conference, and now they are doing their best to undermine the conference.

    It is entirely understandable that the U.S. government is the main enemy of the Bandung Conference. Just as in Europe, American monopoly capital is constantly creating new sources of harassment in Asia and Africa. According to Dulles's plan, the two major continents of Asia and Africa are to be covered with a network of military treaties, mainly against the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. In order to force peace-loving peoples and democratic governments to submit to the U.S. war policy in these regions, the U.S. ruling clique has put pressure on them. A series of treaties that dangerously threaten peace in Asia have already been signed, such as the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty," the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek military treaty, and the military treaties separately signed by the United States with Thailand, South Vietnam, South Korea, and Pakistan. But the people of Asia are firmly opposed to being used as cannon fodder for American warmongers. Dulles's threats and intimidation against the peace-loving Asian people and the Bandung Conference at the recent Southeast Asia Treaty Organization conference in Bangkok have not succeeded. On the contrary, it has further convinced the Asian people that the convening and holding of the Bandung Conference are of particular significance for maintaining peace.

    Recently, American aggressors have intensified dangerous activities in the Taiwan area aimed at provoking an atomic war against the People's Republic of China. The majority of Asian countries also agree on this issue: Taiwan is undoubtedly an inseparable part of the territory of the People's Republic of China. The settlement of the Taiwan issue is an internal affair of the Chinese people. In order to maintain peace, the American invading troops must withdraw from the Taiwan area.

    The people of Europe are watching the preparation process of the Bandung Conference with great interest. Peace is indivisible. The easing of international tensions in Asia will have a beneficial impact on the situation in Europe, just as the tension in Europe will complicate the situation in Asia. The Geneva Conference proved this interaction. The easing of international tensions achieved at that time had a favorable impact not only on Asia but also on Europe. The German people attach particular importance to the Bandung Conference mainly for this reason. Any easing of tensions in international relations will have a positive impact on efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution of the German question.

    Our motherland is still in a state of division. Imperialist and revanchist forces rule the western part of our Germany, and with the active support of the United States, they are trying to restore the power of German militarism. The Bonn Federal Parliament approved the Paris war agreements a few weeks ago, creating a new situation in Germany. West Germany can no longer be regarded as a peace-loving country. The government of the German Democratic Republic has been forced to take measures to defend the worker-peasant regime and its achievements. The government and people of the German Democratic Republic, in a solid alliance with the Soviet Union, the European people's democracies, and the People's Republic of China, are determined not to be caught off guard by aggressive militaristic forces. The ratification and implementation of the Paris war agreements have deepened the division of Germany. The Four-Power Conference on a peaceful settlement of the German question has become meaningless because it is impossible to unify the peace-loving German Democratic Republic with the war-mongering, revanchist West Germany. If the German people's movement can overturn the Bonn Federal Parliament's ratification decision and abolish the Paris war agreements, then negotiations on the German question can be resumed.

    The implementation of the Paris agreements is facing strong resistance in Europe. This is understandable. The people of Europe, based on their own painful experience, realize that the rearmament of German militarists is not just a German affair but concerns the people of all countries. German imperialism and militarism have twice plunged the world into war in forty years. There will be no lasting peace in Europe without a peaceful resolution of the German question on a democratic basis. It is of great significance that insightful politicians such as Indian Prime Minister Nehru recognize this relationship and advocate a peaceful resolution of the German question.

    For our people, the holding of the Bandung Conference has, to some extent, created similar possibilities for solving the vital problems of the German people. The conference proves that it is entirely possible for countries with different social systems to consult with each other if all parties have a willingness to understand. The Bandung Conference once again shows that representatives from two parts of a country that is also divided—Vietnam—can sit at the same negotiating table. The Geneva Conference is an example showing that international conferences can achieve positive results as long as all relevant countries participate in the conference and all parties have a sincere desire to resolve disputes peacefully. What can be done in Asia can certainly be done in Europe. Abandoning the Paris war agreements would create favorable conditions for resolving the German question through peaceful negotiations with the participation of representatives from both parts of Germany. The Bandung Conference is a new example showing that peaceful consultations that help ease international tensions and thus contribute to the peace and security of all peoples are entirely possible. Therefore, the German people sincerely wish the Bandung Conference success.

    德国人民欢迎亚非会议
    德意志民主共和国外交部国务秘书　葛奥格·汉德克
    二十九个亚非国家政府的官方代表团会聚在印度尼西亚的万隆，参加定于今日开幕的意义重大的亚非国家会议。
    这次会议的中心问题，是保卫和巩固和平、反对殖民主义和反对种族歧视，以及经济建设和发展等问题。因此，万隆会议不但对亚非两洲，而且对全世界都是具有重要意义的。
    万隆会议是一个明显的例子，说明具有不同政治和社会制度的国家是能够在一起和平协商保卫和平的问题、独立平等的问题以及经济合作的问题等一切有关各国人民和平共处的问题的。这就是为什么万隆会议不但受到亚非各国人民的热烈欢迎，而且也获得全世界爱好和平的力量的热烈拥护的原因。
    我们德国人民也关心地和同情地注意着亚非人民为保障和平、争取民族独立和组织和平合作而作出的努力。
    德意志民主共和国——第一个爱好和平的和民主的德意志国家——旨在保卫欧洲和平和建立一个统一、爱好和平、民主和独立的德国的对外政策，支持亚非人民的自由斗争和他们争取巩固和平的努力。
    亚非会议生动地反映了亚洲局势的变化。亚非各国人民决心要摆脱殖民主义枷锁，生活在不受外国的监督和干涉的环境里。这次会议一定会使亚洲和非洲的民族自由独立运动走向进一步的高涨。
    参加会议的各国人口占全人类的将近三分之二，这个事实显示出会议的重大意义。万隆会议的举行是和中国的发展分不开的。
    伟大的中国人民的具有世界历史意义的胜利，唤起亚洲人民为把自己国家从殖民制度下解放出来、为争取国家主权而斗争。对被压迫的亚非各国人民来说，中华人民共和国以及越南和朝鲜人民的自由斗争是贯彻人民自由意志的光辉榜样。印度的局势也具有重要意义。印度今天已不再是一个殖民地国家了。印度共和国是亚洲地区和平和人民友好的一个重要因素。除印度以外，印度尼西亚和缅甸也摆脱了殖民制度。中华人民共和国、印度和缅甸彼此之间建立了友好睦邻的关系，这种关系对亚洲的局势起着重大的影响。这些国家确认了国家之间和平合作的原则，这是具有历史意义的一件大事。他们的关于在尊重别国领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利和和平共处的基础上同各国建立关系的联合声明，在亚洲和非洲各地以及在其他各洲获得了广泛的反响。爱好和平的人们今天有权利提出这个问题：为什么世界各国政府和议会不能承认和维护这些原则呢？
    举行万隆会议的建议当然使帝国主义国家大为不安。美国的“芝加哥太阳时报”这样写道：“艾森豪威尔政府认为即将召开的亚非会议是极不受欢迎的。”起初帝国主义者企图尽量贬低亚非会议的意义，现在他们正在竭力破坏会议的进行。
    美国政府是万隆会议的主要敌人，这是完全可以理解的。如同在欧洲一样，美国垄断资本也在亚洲和非洲不断制造新的骚扰的策源地。按照杜勒斯的计划，亚非两大洲要布满军事条约网，主要是反对苏联和中华人民共和国。为了使爱好和平的各国人民和民主的政府屈从于美国在这些地区的战争政策，美国统治集团对它们施加了压力。已经签订了一系列的危险地威胁着亚洲和平的条约，如“东南亚集体防务条约”、美蒋军事条约，美国同泰国、南越、南朝鲜、巴基斯坦分别签订的军事条约等。但是亚洲人民坚决反对为美国战争贩子充当炮灰。杜勒斯在最近的东南亚集团国家曼谷会议上向爱好和平的亚洲人民和万隆会议发出的威胁、恫吓并没有得逞。相反地，却更加使亚洲人民相信，万隆会议的召开和举行对维护和平是具有特别重大的意义的。
    近来，美国侵略者在台湾地区加紧进行旨在挑起反对中华人民共和国的原子战争的危险活动。大多数亚洲国家在这个问题上意见也是一致的：台湾肯定无疑地是中华人民共和国的领土的一部分。解决台湾问题是中国人民的内部事情。为了维护和平，美国侵略军队就必须从台湾地区撤走。
    欧洲各国人民怀着巨大的兴趣注意着万隆会议的准备过程。和平是不可分割的。国际紧张局势在亚洲的缓和会对欧洲局势产生良好的影响，正如欧洲局势的紧张也会使亚洲局势复杂化一样。日内瓦会议证明了这种交互作用。那时所达到的国际紧张局势的缓和，不但对亚洲，而且也对欧洲产生了有利的影响。德国人民之所以特别重视万隆会议，主要原因就在于此。任何国际关系中的紧张局势的缓和都会对争取和平解决德国问题的努力产生积极的影响。
    我们的祖国一直还处于分裂状态。帝国主义和复仇势力统治着我们德国的西部，他们在美国的积极支持下力图重新恢复德国军国主义的势力。波恩联邦议院在几星期前批准了巴黎战争协定，从而在德国出现了新的局势。西德不能再被看作是爱好和平的国家了。德意志民主共和国政府被迫不得不采取保卫工农政权及其成果的措施。德意志民主共和国政府和人民同苏联、欧洲各人民民主国家和中华人民共和国结成坚固的联盟，决心不使自己在侵略成性的军国主义势力面前措手不及。巴黎战争协定的批准和实施，加深了德国的分裂。关于和平解决德国问题的四大国会议变成没有意义了，因为不可能使爱好和平的德意志民主共和国和战争狂的、复仇主义的西德统一起来。如果德国人民运动能够取消波恩联邦议院的批准决定和废除巴黎战争协定，那末关于德国问题的谈判才有重新举行的可能。
    巴黎协定的实施正在欧洲遭到强大的反抗。这是可以了解的。欧洲各国人民根据亲身的惨痛经验认识到，德国军国主义分子的重新武装不只是德国的事情，而且是关系到各国人民的事情。德国帝国主义和军国主义在四十年中两次使世界陷于战祸。不在民主的基础上和平解决德国问题，欧洲就不会有持久的和平。像印度总理尼赫鲁等有卓见的政治家们认识到这种关系并主张和平解决德国问题，是具有重大意义的。
    对我国人民来说，由于万隆会议的举行，在一定程度上产生了解决德国人民切身问题的类似的可能性。会议证明：如果各方面都怀有谅解的意愿的话，具有不同社会制度的国家互相进行协商是完全可能的。万隆会议再次表明，一个也像德国一样被分裂的国家——越南两部分的代表是能够坐在一张谈判桌旁的。日内瓦会议就是一个例子，它说明：国际会议是能够获得积极的结果的，只要各有关国家参加会议，并且各方面都有着和平解决争端的真诚愿望的话。在亚洲可能做到的，在欧洲也一定能做到。放弃巴黎战争协定就会产生有利的条件，在德国两部分代表的参加下可以用和平协商的方式解决德国问题。万隆会议是一个新的例子，说明有助于缓和国际紧张局势，因而也就有助于各国人民的和平安全的和平协商是完全可能的。因此，德国人民谨祝万隆会议获得成功。
