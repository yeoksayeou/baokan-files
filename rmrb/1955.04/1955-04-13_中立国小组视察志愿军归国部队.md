The personnel of the inspection team received full convenience and assistance from the liaison officers of the Korean-Chinese side and the personnel of the returning Chinese People's Volunteers troops during their work, and the inspection was carried out smoothly. From April 8th to 11th, the four days, they did not raise any questions arising from the inspection to the liaison officers of the Korean-Chinese side, nor did they conduct any re-examinations due to discrepancies in the figures.
