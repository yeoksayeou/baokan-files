The Ministry of Water Conservancy, in conjunction with the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy departments of Hebei and Shanxi provinces, has organized a survey team to conduct soil and water conservation surveys in the upper reaches of the Yongding River and Ziya River.

The upper reaches of the Yongding River consist of the Yang River, Sanggan River, and Gui River, covering a drainage area of over 47,000 square kilometers, including 26 counties and 3 cities in Hebei and Shanxi provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Due to the destruction of vegetation cover in the upper reaches and concentrated rainfall, severe soil erosion has occurred. According to measurements at the Guanting Hydrological Station, the average annual sediment transport is 55 million cubic meters. After the completion of the Guanting Reservoir, it is seriously threatening the reservoir's lifespan. The upper reaches of the Ziya River are the Fuyang River and Hutuo River, with a drainage area of 31,000 square kilometers, including 29 counties and 3 cities in Hebei and Shanxi provinces. Due to the steep slopes and rapid flow in the upper reaches, soil erosion is severe, with an annual sediment transport of 7 million cubic meters. The vast cotton and wheat producing areas downstream and the Beijing-Hankou Railway are severely threatened.

In order to systematically prevent soil erosion and achieve full utilization of soil and water resources, the Ministry of Water Conservancy, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Forestry, Hebei and Shanxi provinces, Henan Agricultural College, Huangcun Forestry School, the Academy of Sciences, and other eight departments have formed two survey teams consisting of 366 cadres, experts, and students. They began work in March and April respectively, and it is expected that the field work in the above-mentioned areas will be completed in July.

After the completion of this survey work, it can provide the typical areas in these 55 counties and 6 cities with construction plans for 1956; propose future production development directions for general areas, and provide reliable data for formulating long-term plans and guiding production.

    永定河子牙河上游水土保持勘查工作开始
    水利部会同林业部、农业部以及河北山西两省农林水利部门等组织勘查队，进行永定河和子牙河上游的水土保持勘查工作。
    永定河上游是洋河、桑乾河、妫水河三条河流，流域面积四万七千多平方公里，包括河北、山西两省和内蒙自治区的二十六个县、三个市的范围。由于上游植物覆盖遭到破坏，暴雨集中，造成了严重的水土流失现象。据官厅水文站测验，每年平均输沙量五千五百万公方。官厅水库建成后，严重的威胁着水库寿命。子牙河上游是滏阳河和滹沱河，流域面积三万一千平方公里，包括河北、山西两省的二十九个县、三个市的范围。由于上游坡陡流急，水土流失严重，年输沙量达七百万公方。下游广大棉麦产区和京汉铁路受到严重威胁。
    为了有计划地进行制止水土流失，达到水土资源充分利用，特由水利部、农业部、林业部、河北、山西两省、河南农学院、黄村林业学校、科学院等八个部门的干部、专家和学生共三百六十六人，组成两个勘查大队。分别于三、四月间开始工作，预计七月间可完成上述各地的勘查外业工作。
    此项调查工作完了后，可以给这五十五个县六个市中的典型区，提出一九五六年施工计划；一般地区提出今后的生产发展方向，给制定长远计划和领导生产提供可靠资料。
