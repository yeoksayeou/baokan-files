Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 9th: Matsumoto Jiichiro, head of the Japanese delegation attending the Asian Countries Conference, spoke at the plenary session of the Asian Countries Conference on the morning of April 7th.

Matsumoto Jiichiro said: The progress of China's great revolution, as well as the contributions of Asian and Arab countries such as India, Burma, and Indonesia to world peace and to the resolution of various Asian problems, are Asia's great hope and dawn.

However, some people hope to extinguish Asia's hope and dawn, hoping to create division instead of peace.

Matsumoto Jiichiro said that in 1951, Japan was forced to sign two international treaties, namely the San Francisco Treaty and the "US-Japan Security Treaty," which were nominally "treaties of renewed reconciliation and mutual trust." But in fact, the purpose of these treaties was only to subordinate Japan, rearm Japan, and establish foreign bases in Japan. As a result, hundreds of military bases were built, and Okinawa Island became a permanent military fortress, with the rights of the people on the island being severely violated. Moreover, as everyone knows, de facto military forces in violation of the peaceful constitution have been established in Japan. These military bases in Japan were fully utilized during the Korean War and the Indochina War. The United States is not satisfied with signing more military treaties with some countries individually. It has established a military alliance in Southeast Asia—the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the purpose of which is to maintain colonial rule in Asia. And it is also trying to expand the aggressive alliance.

Matsumoto Jiichiro said that thanks to the efforts of Asian countries, the local conflicts in Korea and Indochina have ended, but the United States is trying to find another way to interfere in Asian affairs from the Taiwan area. During the Korean War and the Indochina War, someone demanded the "use of atomic bombs." At that time, some military bases in Japan had atomic weapons and airplanes loaded with atomic bombs.

The Japanese people personally suffered the actual disaster of atomic bombs during World War II, and also suffered great pain in the hydrogen bomb test on Bikini Island. Asia should not allow anyone to use atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs. We must prevent and shatter military alliances formed solely for the benefit of Western countries. We must abolish all foreign military bases in Asia, including bases using nuclear weapons.

Matsumoto Jiichiro said that more than 20 million Japanese people have already signed petitions calling for the prohibition of the use, manufacture, and testing of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs. Now, with full confidence and expectation, the people are strengthening the struggle against the establishment of military bases in Japan.

Matsumoto Jiichiro continued, recently, delegations from the Chinese Red Cross and Mrs. Pandit of India visited Japan. Now the Chinese trade delegation in Japan is receiving a warm welcome from the Japanese people. The friendship between the people of Japan and China is growing stronger. The friendship of the entire Asia has also been strengthened. Now we are here attending the Asian Countries Conference, seeking cooperation based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit.

Our Japanese delegation sincerely hopes to have frank and open discussions with you, representatives from various Asian countries. We hope to restore diplomatic relations with those Asian neighbors who have not yet restored diplomatic relations with Japan. We also hope to promote the People's Republic of China's entry into the United Nations. We hope to contribute to Asian economic and cultural exchanges. We also hope that peace will be truly guaranteed on the basis of the unity of Asian countries.

Matsumoto Jiichiro finally said, I hope to exclude foreign interference, oppression, military alliances, and divisive policies from Asia, and through this conference, establish a true and solid policy for peace, liberation, cooperation, equality, and mutual benefit.

### 松本治一郎在亚洲国家会议上发言

    松本治一郎在亚洲国家会议上发言
    新华社新德里九日讯　出席亚洲国家会议的日本代表团团长松本治一郎四月七日上午在亚洲国家会议全体会议上发言。
    松本治一郎说：中国的伟大革命的进展，以及印度、缅甸和印度尼西亚等亚洲和阿拉伯国家对世界和平、对解决亚洲各种问题的贡献，是亚洲的巨大希望和曙光。
    但是，有人希望扑灭亚洲的希望和曙光，希望造成分裂而不是和平。
    松本治一郎说，在一九五一年，日本被迫签订了两项国际条约，这就是旧金山和约和“美日安全条约”，这些条约在名义上是“重新和好和互相信任的条约”。但是事实上这些条约的目的只是使日本居于从属地位，重新武装日本，在日本建立外国基地。结果修建了几百个军事基地，冲绳岛变成了永久的军事堡垒，岛上的人民的权利横遭侵犯。而且大家知道，违反和平宪法的实际上的军事部队已在日本建立了。这些在日本的军事基地在朝鲜战争和印度支那战争期间都曾被充分利用。美国对于同一些国家单独签订更多的军事条约是不满足的。它已在东南亚成立了军事联盟——所谓东南亚条约组织，其目的就是维持在亚洲的殖民统治。而且它还在设法扩大侵略联盟。
    松本治一郎说，由于亚洲国家的努力，朝鲜和印度支那的局部冲突已经终止，但是美国却正在设法从台湾地区寻找干涉亚洲事务的另一条道路。在朝鲜战争和印度支那战争期间，有人要求“使用原子弹”。当时，日本的一些军事基地曾得到原子武器和装载原子弹的飞机。
    日本人民在第二次世界大战时曾亲身遭受了原子弹的实际灾难，而且在比基尼岛的氢弹试验中又遭受了很大的痛苦。亚洲不应当允许任何人使用原子弹和氢弹。我们必须阻止并粉碎仅仅为了西方国家利益而结成的军事联盟。我们必须取消亚洲的一切外国军事基地，包括使用核子武器的基地在内。
  　松本治一郎说，已经有二千万以上的日本人民在要求禁止使用、制造和实验原子弹和氢弹的呼吁书上签了名。现在，人民怀抱着充分的自信和期望，正在加强着反对在日本建立军事基地的斗争。
    松本治一郎继续说，最近，中国红十字会代表团和印度的潘迪特夫人分别访问了日本。现在在日本的中国贸易代表团受到日本人民的热烈欢迎。日中两国人民的友谊正在日益加强。整个亚洲的友谊也有了加强。现在我们在这里出席亚洲国家会议，谋求根据平等互利原则进行合作。
    我们日本代表团衷心希望同你们来自亚洲各个国家的代表们毫无保留地畅谈。我们希望同那些还没有同日本恢复外交关系的亚洲邻邦恢复外交关系。我们还希望促使中华人民共和国进入联合国。我们希望对亚洲经济和文化交流作出贡献。我们还希望在亚洲各国团结的基础上使和平得到真正的保证。
    松本治一郎最后说，我希望把外来干涉、压制、军事联盟和分裂政策从亚洲排除出去，并通过这次会议建立争取和平、解放、合作、平等和互利的真正而坚实的政策。
