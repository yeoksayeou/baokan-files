At the recent model conference held by the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications' Highway General Bureau, Liao Dongliang, a second-class road-building model worker, was selected as a representative to attend the National Highway Model Workers Congress. Four years ago, Liao Dongliang was just an ordinary worker. Now, he is a skilled worker-cadre and a Communist Party member.

At the age of twenty-four, Liao Dongliang arrived at the construction site of the Kangzang Highway (Sichuan-Tibet Highway). Building roads on steep stone cliffs presented many difficulties, and at that point, Liao Dongliang didn't want to continue building the road. Captain Guo Zhenting earnestly said to him: The glory of our working class lies in our ability to overcome any difficulty. Old workers also said to him: The country needs us to build well. We can't only think of ourselves. These words finally made Liao Dongliang determined to become a good worker. From then on, he worked exceptionally hard, diligently studied technology, gradually became a learning model, was loved by his comrades, and was promoted to squad leader and platoon leader. On the Langla Mountain on the bank of the Lancang River, he led dozens of comrades to successfully complete a retaining wall project. During the rainy season in the Bomi area, he created the "single-strand earth removal" method on a steep slope by the river, preventing comrades removing earth in the rain from falling into the river. When rushing to repair culverts on steep rocks, he didn't leave the construction site for five days and five nights, completing a ten-day task in five days. For more than two years, he and the team he led have maintained their model status.

In the spring of 1954, snow melted in the high mountains of the Bomi area, and the river began to rise. Tens of thousands of workers and soldiers entered the construction site west of the Songzong River. Food and materials needed to be transported forward, and cars needed to cross the river, so the Songzong Bridge needed to be built as soon as possible. Liao Dongliang and the team he led accepted the task of building the bridge. From the beginning, difficulties came one after another. The wood was upstream from the river, eight miles away from the bridge site. If it was transported by car on the highway, a temporary bridge for transporting materials would have to be built first. If it was transported by water, the water was rapid and there were many reefs. Liao Dongliang explored the route for a day and felt that water transportation was not feasible, and building a temporary bridge would delay the time and the construction of tens of thousands of people. Finally, he came up with the idea of ​​erecting thick iron wires diagonally across the river, tying the wood to the iron wires with iron rings, and using hydraulic power to send the wood to the opposite bank where the road passed. This not only saved time but also saved more than 600 man-days. After the materials were prepared, problems arose with digging the bridge foundation. When they finally built the cofferdam around the foundation pit, the water pump kept malfunctioning. It would fill with water again as soon as it was nearly dry and the machine stopped. At this time, other construction sites were also short of pumping equipment, and it was too late to transport pumps from the rear. He and the deputy platoon leader promptly researched and created a wooden water pump. When digging the last foundation pit, the flood was visibly rising, and the rapid waves threatened the cofferdam. He quickly directed the workers to use wooden cages to load stones and build a flood barrier upstream, preparing to complete six days of work in three days. Coincidentally, the cofferdam leaked, but the problem could not be found. At this time, Liao Dongliang ignored the icy snow water and went into the water twice to feel around, determining that there was a crack in a large solitary rock inside the cofferdam. At that time, the hydraulic force was too great to block it, and many people advocated blowing it up and rebuilding the cofferdam. But how to blast in the water? Liao Dongliang came up with an idea to coat the fuse and explosives with asphalt so that blasting could be carried out in the water. After two days and three nights, they finally built the bridge, and trucks carrying large quantities of supplies drove from the new bridge they built to the front construction site.

As the highway was about to be fully opened to traffic, Liao Dongliang seriously considered a question: I have done my best and made some achievements. But this is the result of the education and help of the Party and comrades. In order to undertake more arduous tasks in the construction of the motherland, I want to strive to become a Communist Party member. On the eve of the opening of the Kangzang Highway to Lhasa, he was finally admitted to the Party.

    筑路模范廖栋梁
    新华社记者　赵家烈
    交通部公路总局第一工程局最近召开的庆贺模范大会上，二等筑路模范廖栋梁被选为出席全国公路模范代表大会的代表。四年前，廖栋梁还是一个普通工人，现在他是一个精练的工人干部和共产党员了。
    二十四岁那年，廖栋梁到了康藏公路建筑工地。在陡峭的石崖间修路，遇到许多困难，这时，廖栋梁不想修路了。队长郭振庭恳切地向他说：我们工人阶级所以光荣，就在于我们能克服任何困难。老工人也对他说：国家需要我们好好建设。我们不能只想到个人。这些话使廖栋梁最后下定决心，非作个好工人不可。从那以后，他工作特别努力，用心钻研技术，逐渐成为学习模范，受到同志们的爱戴，并被提升为小队长、分队长。在澜沧江岸郎拉山上，他带领几十个同志出色地完成了一项保坎工程；在波密区的雨季里，他在临河陡山上创造了“单丝排土”法，使冒雨排土的同志们避免了摔下河去的危险；在陡岩上抢修涵洞时，他五天五夜没离开工地，十天的任务，他们五天就完成了。两年多来，他和他领导的分队一直保持着模范称号。
    一九五四年春天，波密区高山雪融，河水开始上涨。数万工人、战士进到了松宗河以西工地上。粮食、料具要往前运，汽车要过河，松宗桥必需尽快架好。廖栋梁和他领导的分队就接受了这项架桥任务。从开始，困难就一个接一个地逼来。木料在河的上游，离桥位八里路，如果从公路上用汽车运，就要先架一座运料的便桥；从水里运，水急礁多。廖栋梁探了一天路线，感到水运是不行的，架便桥就耽误了时间，要耽误几万人施工。最后他想出了用粗铁丝斜着架在河上，把木料用铁环系在铁丝上，用水力把木料送到通公路的对岸。这样不但争取了时间，而且节省了六百多个人工。料备好了，挖桥基又出了问题。当他们好容易垒起了围基坑的堰时，抽水机不断发生故障，刚快抽干，机器一停又灌满了水。这时其他工地也正缺抽水设备，从后方运来抽水机是来不及了。他和副分队长又及时研究创造了木制抽水筒。挖最后一个基坑时，洪水眼看着向上涨，急浪威胁着围堰，他赶快指挥工人们用木笼装石头在上游作好拦洪坝，准备把六天的工作在三天内突击完。碰巧堰墙漏水，但又找不到毛病。这时廖栋梁不顾雪水冰凉，两次下水去摸，判定围堰里一个大孤石有了裂缝。当时水力太大，要堵是堵不住的，许多人都主张炸掉它重新垒堰。但水里怎样爆破呢？廖栋梁想出一个办法，用柏油把导火索和炸药都涂起来，这样就可以在水里进行爆破。经过两天三夜，他们终于把桥架起来了，载着大批物资的汽车从他们架起的新桥上驶向前方工地。
    公路快全线通车时，廖栋梁严肃地考虑着一个问题：我尽了我的力量，也作出了些成绩。但这是全党和同志们教育帮助的结果，为了在祖国建设中担负起更艰巨的任务，我要争取作个共产党员。康藏公路通车拉萨前夕，他终于被接收入党了。
