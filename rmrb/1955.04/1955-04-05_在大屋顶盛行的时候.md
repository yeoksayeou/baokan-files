    When Big Roofs Were Popular
    By Our Correspondent Cao Baoming
    In the suburbs of Wuhan, there is a building complex composed of four large buildings. These are "palace-style" collective dormitories built by the Wuhan Real Estate Administration for a certain unit. Local residents call them "temple-like." Although the project has not been fully completed, people can already see its luxurious appearance. The five-story main building features: red-lacquered eaves accentuating a glittering green glazed tile roof; a group of "doves" with outstretched wings standing on the eaves; and "colored clouds" painted on the beams. Workers are using ink to depict colorful architraves and sculpt four cloud-flower pillars in front of the main entrance. According to the original design, the entire wall surface will be plastered with "mung bean paste" and "terrazzo," making it look like a building made of stone, and the lower part of the building will have a "sumeru pedestal" resembling white marble. The main hall inside the main building will also be decorated with wooden relief "caisson" ceiling panels, white balustrade verandas – the railings will also be sculpted with treasure vase flowers, terrazzo floors with colored copper strips, and carefully designed seven palace lanterns. The interior walls are also very elaborate, all of which will be plastered with "Kesai silver." The other three auxiliary buildings are the same as the main building except for the lack of a hall and the decoration of the main entrance. In addition, there are three colorful three-story high paifangs, with flower bed obelisk-style lamp posts.

    What is the necessity of putting an ancient architectural coat on an ordinary dormitory! This can only have one result: wasting money. For example: the more than 7,000 square meters of glazed tile roof costs 111,500 yuan more than an ordinary roof; the three unnecessary paifangs cost 43,000 yuan; the double lane in front of the gate is more than twice as thick as an ordinary road surface, wasting 33,000 yuan more than the actual need; the terrazzo floor is 6,900 yuan more expensive than an ordinary cement floor; the palace lanterns cost more than 4,000 yuan; the flower bed obelisk-style lamp posts cost 1,400 yuan. The total budgeted cost of this group of buildings is 1.39 million yuan, but according to incomplete statistics, the money spent on many false structures and luxurious decorations amounts to as much as more than 290,000 yuan, accounting for 22 percent of the total budget. This money could build more than 4,000 square meters of dormitories of the same structure.

    Why spend so much money to build such a luxurious dormitory externally?

    In 1953, the Wuhan Real Estate Administration accepted the task of building this group of dormitories, and technician Yu Shuchang was responsible for the design. Building a dormitory worth more than one million yuan is a major project in Wuhan. At the beginning, Director Li Weizhen did not consider how to make the project more economical. He first thought that it should be built in a grand and decent manner. Therefore, when technician Yu first drew the sketches, Director Li felt that the exterior was not decorated and not beautiful. What about technician Yu? He was not satisfied with his design either. What to do? Finally, Director Li came up with an idea:

    "Now the upturned eaves roof is popular! Let's also do an upturned eaves roof."

    "This will cost a lot of labor and materials!" said technician Yu.

    "The money will be spent a little more. We want to do upturned eaves on the basis of saving." Director Li made a conclusion.

    Director Li was very interested in upturned eaves roofs. Although he did not understand what upturned eaves roofs were, he was very enthusiastic. He personally led the company manager and a section chief to Changsha to visit the "palace-style" auditorium, and brought back a set of drawings.

    In fact, technician Yu did not sincerely want to save money. Although he made suggestions, he also thought: "Anyway, you are the leader, you can do whatever you want. If you insist on not doing it, you will think that I can't do it! If you don't do it, then forget it, but if you want to do it, you have to pay attention to the 'rules', otherwise it will be a 'neither fish nor fowl' and people will laugh at you, saying it is 'eclecticism'!" In the design, he had to thank Mr. Liang Sicheng's works – those books that fully praised classical architecture. He had read those books and admired the arguments in the books, so in the design, he first required a glazed tile big roof, a foundation of imitation white marble, and a gate with large pillars. In order to make the building's colors bright and eye-catching, colored paint should also be applied to some cement walls. He thought of transforming the animal heads on ancient buildings into "doves." He felt that the square in front of the main entrance was too "monotonous," so he designed a flower bed obelisk-style lamp post. In order to enhance the architectural artistic atmosphere of the hall, although the lamps were not his design, he was afraid that the ones ordered by others would not be beautiful enough, so he "spared no expense" to design a "revolving lantern" pattern and stipulated that it should be made of expensive mahogany.

    Not long after, especially after Comrade Khrushchev's report at the All-Union Conference of Builders was published in the newspaper, Director Li felt that the loss to the country was serious. He pulled the deputy director to the construction site. Just as the three auxiliary buildings were about to be tiled, they were ordered to immediately change all the tiles to red tiles. They also determined a principle with the construction site: what has already been done will not be moved, and what has not been done will be streamlined as much as possible. Although the foundations of the main building's large roof, the auxiliary buildings' large roof frames, and the three paifangs had been completed, and a loss of more than 130,000 yuan was irreparable, they finally saved more than 159,000 yuan for the country.

    When I visited these comrades, they all felt sad about wasting the country's property. The Real Estate Administration is preparing to make a formal inspection report, and technician Yu is also preparing to write his own lessons. However, their understanding is still not deep enough. Technician Yu said: "I made suggestions in the past! They were the ones who asked to build it, and they were the ones who asked to demolish it, and in the end I have to make a self-criticism." Director Li said: "I asked to do this form, but I didn't ask him to make it so luxurious! Now when I look at it, it's colorful, really dazzling." They also had a common opinion:

    "This form of construction was so popular at that time!" They did not expect that by pursuing form and catering to this trend, they squandered a lot of the country's assets! Of course, it is good and welcome to be able to correct one's mistakes immediately after discovering them. But how to learn from this mistake and further criticize the extravagant waste and formalistic architectural thinking remains for them to conduct a more in-depth examination.

    在大屋顶盛行的时候
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    在武汉市郊外有一个由四幢大楼组成的建筑群，这是武汉市房地产管理局给某单位修建的“宫殿式”的集体宿舍，当地的居民称它是“庙堂样的”。虽然工程还没有全部完工，人们已能看到它豪华的外貌。五层楼的主楼是：红漆屋檐衬托着闪闪发光的绿琉璃瓦屋顶；飞檐上伫立着一群展翅欲飞的“鸽子”；在梁头上，画上了朵朵“彩云”；工人们正在用油墨描绘五彩缤纷的额枋和堆塑正门前的四根云花大柱。按照原来的设计，整个墙面都将抹上
  “绿豆沙”和“汰石子”，使它像一座石头砌成的大楼，而房屋下部还有汉白玉般的“须弥座”。主楼内的大厅也将装饰上木制浮雕的“藻井”顶板、白色的勾栏围廊——栏杆上还塑有宝瓶花、有彩色的镶铜条的水磨石的地面和精心设计的七盏宫灯。内部的墙壁也很讲究，都将抹上“克赛银”。其余三栋辅楼除了没有大厅和正门的装饰外，都跟主楼一样。此外，还有三座彩色的三层楼高的大牌楼，有花坛华表式的灯柱。
    把一座普通的宿舍披上古代建筑的外衣究竟有什么必要呢！这只能有一个结果：浪费金钱。例如：七千多平方公尺的琉璃瓦屋顶比普通屋顶的造价贵十一万一千五百多元；毫无必要的三座大牌楼价值四万三千多元；门前的双车道比普通路面厚一倍多，比实际需要浪费三万三千元；水磨石地面比普通水泥地面贵六千九百多元；宫灯价值四千多元；花坛华表式灯柱价值一千四百多元。这群建筑的总预算造价是一百三十九万元，但根据不完全的统计，许多虚假的结构和豪华的装饰所要花的钱即达二十九万多元之巨，竟占全部预算百分之二十二，这笔钱可以修建同样结构的宿舍四千多平方公尺。
    为什么要花许多钱来修建外部这样豪华的宿舍呢？
    一九五三年，武汉市房地产管理局接受了建筑这群宿舍的任务，由技术员俞树昌负责设计。修建上百万元的宿舍在武汉市说来是一项大工程。开始，局长李惟真就没有很好考虑如何使这项工程建筑得经济些，首先认为要盖得大方些，像样些。因此，当俞技术员第一次绘出草图的时候，李局长一看就认为外部没有装饰，不美观。俞技术员呢？对自己的这个设计也不满意。怎么办呢？最后，李局长出了个主意：
    “现在可风行翘角屋顶啦！我们也搞个翘角的。”
    “这样做很花工花料！”俞技术员说。
    “钱是会多花一些的。我们要在节约的基础上来搞翘角的。”李局长做了结论。
    李局长对翘角屋顶的兴趣很浓厚，他虽然没有弄清翘角屋顶是怎么回事，却兴致勃勃，曾亲自领着公司经理和一个科长去长沙参观“宫殿式”的礼堂，并且带回一套图纸。
    其实，俞技术员也并不是诚心想节省的。他虽然提了意见，但也想：“反正你是领导，你要怎样做就怎样做，要坚持不做，还以为我不会做呢！不做便罢，要做就讲究‘规矩’，不然做得‘四不像’还给人家笑话，说是‘折衷主义’呢！”在设计上他倒要感谢梁思成先生的著作——那些全面赞扬古典建筑的书籍，他看过那些书，也崇拜书上的论点，于是在设计上首先就要求有琉璃瓦大屋顶、仿汉白玉的房屋基座和有大柱的门庭。为了使建筑的颜色鲜艳夺目，还要在某些水泥墙上涂抹彩色油漆。他想到把古代建筑上的兽头改造成“鸽子”。他嫌正门前的广场太“单调”，设计了个花坛华表式灯柱。为了加强大厅建筑艺术的气氛，虽然灯不归他设计，但他怕别人订制的不够美，便“不惜工本”地自己动手设计了一个“走马灯式”的图案，并规定要用价值昂贵的红木制作。
    事过不久，特别当赫鲁晓夫同志在全苏建筑工作者会议上的报告在报上登出来以后，李局长这时才感到这样作给国家造成的损失严重。他拉着副局长赶到工地去，正好三栋辅楼刚开始上瓦，他们叫立即全部改为红瓦。他们又同工地确定一条原则：已经做好了的就不动，没做的就尽量精简。虽然主楼大屋顶、辅楼大屋架和三座牌楼的基础已做好，有十三万多元的损失已不可挽救，终于还为国家挽回了十五万九千多元的损失。
    我去访问这些同志的时候，他们都对浪费了国家财产感到难过，房地产管理局准备正式作出检查报告，俞技术员也准备写出自己的教训。不过，他们的认识还是不够深刻的。俞技术员说：“我过去就提过意见呀！叫做的是他们，叫拆的也是他们，最后还得我检讨。”李局长说：“我叫做这种形式，可没叫他做这样豪华的呀！现在做起来一看，五颜六色，真打眼得很。”他们还有一个共同的意见：
  “修这种形式，那时候是这样风行的呀！”他们却没有想到，由于追求形式、由于迎合这阵风，竟挥霍了国家许多的资财！当然，发现自己错误以后能立即纠正，这是好的，是值得欢迎的。但如何从这次错误中接受教训，进一步批判铺张浪费作风和形式主义建筑思想，还有待于他们进行更深入地检查。
