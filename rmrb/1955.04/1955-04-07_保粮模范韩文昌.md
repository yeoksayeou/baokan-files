    Grain Preservation Model Han Wenchang
    Ning Qingying
    Han Wenchang, a warehouse keeper at the Baotou Municipal Grain Bureau, has kept the grain he manages from being damaged at all for two years. Han Wenchang has therefore been named a grain preservation model three times.
    Han Wenchang is a member of the Communist Youth League who was born into a poor family and personally suffered the pain of having no food to eat, so he deeply understands the value of grain. In 1951, he came to the grain depot as a cook, where he worked very actively and took time to help other comrades pack, clean, and sort the grain. In the autumn of 1952, he became a grain keeper. Some comrades believed that storage work was "dirty work with no future," but he believed that any position in revolutionary work was glorious, so he was not afraid of hardship in his work and was very active.
    Due to his low level of education, Han Wenchang encountered many difficulties in weighing, checking grain temperature, and registering cards at the beginning. However, with the help of his comrades, he quickly learned these skills. He was very careful in receiving and delivering grain and has never made a mistake. Whenever he had free time, he cleaned up the grain and garbage, and the warehouse and stacking areas he managed were always clean. Whenever it was windy or rainy, he led everyone to cover the stacks and check the grain.
      In the spring of 1954, in order to ensure the safe summering of the grain, Han Wenchang found a way to improve the ventilation of the grain stacks, which greatly reduced the moisture content of the grain. This spring, while inspecting the grain, it was discovered that 180,000 jin of millet had begun to heat up. Han Wenchang immediately rescued the grain, preventing any losses.

    保粮模范韩文昌
    宁清英
    包头市粮食局仓库保管员韩文昌保管的粮食，两年来一点也没有受到损坏。韩文昌因此三次被评为保粮模范。
    韩文昌是个青年团员，生在贫苦的家庭里，亲身受过没有粮食吃的痛苦，深知粮食的可贵。一九五一年他到粮库当炊事员，工作很积极，抽空还帮助别的同志打包，打扫和整理土粮。一九五二年秋天，他当了粮食保管员。有的同志认为保管工作是“吃土工作，没有出息”，他却认为革命工作任何岗位都是光荣的，因此在工作中不怕吃苦，非常积极。
    由于文化程度低，开始的时候，韩文昌在过秤、检查粮食温度、登记卡片等工作中碰到了不少困难。但在同志们的帮助下，他很快地学会了这些业务。他收付粮食十分细心，一直没有发生过差错。一有空闲时间，他就打扫土粮和垃圾，他保管的仓房和囤垛周围经常都干干净净。每当刮风下雨，他就带动大家去苫盖囤垛，检查粮食。
      一九五四年春天，为了保证粮食安全度夏，韩文昌设法改进了粮垛的通风情况，使粮食水分大大降低。今年春天，在检查粮食的时候，发现有十八万斤糜米开始发热。韩文昌就立即抢救，使粮食没有受到损失。
