    I. The aim of Hungary's foreign policy is to guarantee the peaceful and constructive labor of the people and the independence of the motherland.

    IV. The Hungarian People's Republic is willing to maintain friendly relations with all countries, regardless of their social system. The Hungarian government must pay particular attention in the future to expanding existing ties with neighboring countries and those countries that have not joined aggressive blocs.
    V. The Presidium of the National Assembly, in accordance with its declaration of March 1, is instructed to invite foreign parliamentary delegations to visit Hungary in order to promote cooperation between the peoples and parliaments of all countries.

    匈国民议会通过决议确定外交政策方针
    新华社二十四日讯　据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利人民共和国国民议会会议四月二十二日在布达佩斯闭幕。
    会议听取和批准了外交部长雅·波尔多奇基所作的关于共和国外交政策的报告，并且确定匈牙利政府的外交政策的主要方针如下：
    一、匈牙利的外交政策的目的是保障人民的和平的建设性劳动和祖国的独立。
    二、匈牙利的外交政策的主要任务是在政治和文化方面、在防御和其他方面进一步巩固同伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国及社会主义阵营所有其他国家的友谊和兄弟合作。
    三、鉴于巴黎协定的批准和德国军国主义的复活已经使欧洲出现新的局面，并危及和平和包括匈牙利人民在内的各国人民的安全，匈牙利国民议会同意并且认为亟需同参加莫斯科会议的各国缔结友好合作互助条约和关于成立联合军事司令部的协定。
    四、匈牙利人民共和国愿意同一切国家（不问它们的社会制度如何）保持友好关系。匈牙利政府今后必须特别注意扩大同邻国和那些没有参加侵略集团的国家的现有联系。
    五、国民议会主席团根据它三月一日的宣言受命邀请外国议会代表团来匈牙利访问，以便促进各国人民和议会的合作。
