    A Major International Political Conspiracy
    The plane carrying staff members of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference and Chinese and foreign journalists exploded and crashed into the sea over the waters near Sarawak, North Borneo, at 12:15 pm on April 11th. This was by no means an ordinary aviation accident, but a premeditated murder carefully planned by American and Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents. American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's gang of secret agents are carrying out a major international political conspiracy. They are attempting to assassinate the personnel of the Chinese delegation led by Premier Zhou Enlai to the Asian-African Conference, in order to intensify international tensions and undermine the Asian-African Conference. The Chinese people express their utmost indignation at the crimes of the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents.
    Prior to this incident, relevant departments in our country had learned that U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents hiding in Hong Kong were plotting to assassinate personnel of our delegation. Our government promptly notified the British Chargé d'Affaires in Beijing, reminding the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong to take effective measures to ensure the safety of our delegation. Although the British side made promises in this regard, Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents under the direction of the United States still carried out their criminal activities according to the original plan, resulting in this serious incident which is intolerable under international legal norms and international morality. This is perplexing. The British authorities in Hong Kong bear a serious responsibility for this. We demand that the British authorities in Hong Kong immediately take emergency measures to thoroughly investigate the truth of this murder, and arrest and bring to justice the murderers and related criminals.
    As everyone knows, the purpose of the Asian-African Conference is to promote amity and cooperation among Asian and African countries, to explore their mutual and common interests, and to establish and enhance friendly and good-neighborly relations. American imperialism regards such a conference that helps maintain peace in the Asian-African region and promotes friendly cooperation among Asian and African countries as a major obstacle to its expansion and preparations for aggressive war. The U.S. State Department has not only tried its best to distort the purpose of this conference and diminish its influence, but also used various channels and means to undermine this conference and obstruct its convening. American imperialism is particularly annoyed and uneasy about the People's Republic of China's participation in the Asian-African Conference. It fears that many Asian and African countries, through extensive contact at the Asian-African Conference, will enhance their understanding and friendship with the People's Republic of China, and actively oppose the United States' acts of aggression and its policy of preparing for war against the People's Republic of China. This explains why American imperialism is conducting shameless slanders and provocations against the People's Republic of China's participation in the Asian-African Conference, and why it is colluding with Chiang Kai-shek's gang of secret agents to organize despicable plots against the personnel of our delegation.
    According to reliable sources, the plans of American imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, to undermine the Asian-African Conference and assassinate the staff members of the delegation of the People's Republic of China are more extensive and serious than the already occurred plane explosion incident. U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents have long been carrying out a series of conspiracies in Indonesia, the most recent aim of which is to sabotage the Asian-African Conference, prepare to assassinate personnel of our delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, threaten countries that actively support the Asian-African Conference, and even attempt to subvert the Indonesian government. According to Indonesian newspapers, U.S. secret agents and Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents are constantly infiltrating Indonesia to engage in sabotage and disruptive activities. It can be seen that the U.S. aggressive forces entrenched in Taiwan, our country's territory, and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, not only seriously threaten the security of the People's Republic of China, but also seriously threaten the security of the entire Asian region and the friendly cooperation between Asian countries.
    The Asian-African Conference represents twenty-nine countries and 1.44 billion people in Asia and Africa, represents the just demands of oppressed nations who have long suffered from imperialist aggression, and represents the aspirations of all people around the world who uphold peace and oppose new wars. Any destructive conspiracy by American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang cannot hinder the progress of this great conference. Asian and African countries and people should be vigilant and resolutely fight back against the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek destructive activities. The Chinese delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai is determined to fight to the end to ensure the smooth progress of the Asian-African Conference and to safeguard peace in Asia and the world. The delegation's efforts will be fully supported by the 600 million people of China.

### 一个重大的国际政治阴谋

    一个重大的国际政治阴谋
    我国参加亚非会议的代表团工作人员和中外记者所乘飞机，在四月十一日十二时一刻由香港机场起飞后，在飞越北婆罗洲沙捞越附近海面上空时爆炸坠海。这绝不是通常的飞行失事，而是美国和蒋匪特务事先经过周密布置的有计划的谋杀。美帝国主义和蒋匪帮特务正在进行着一个重大的国际政治阴谋。他们企图杀害我国以周恩来总理为首参加亚非会议的代表团人员，以此来加剧国际紧张局势，破坏亚非会议。中国人民对于美蒋特务的罪行，表示无比的愤慨。
    早在这一事件发生以前，我国有关方面即已获悉：匿居香港的美蒋特务，蓄意对我国代表团人员进行暗害。我国政府曾及时地通知在北京的英国代办处，提醒英国政府和香港英国当局，要求他们采取有效措施，保证我国代表团人员的安全。英国方面对此虽然作了承诺，但美国指使下的蒋匪特务仍然按原定计划进行罪恶活动，终于造成了这一为国际法准则和国际道义所不容的严重事件。这是令人难解的。香港英国当局对此负有严重的责任。我们要求香港英国当局立即采取紧急措施，彻底查明这一谋杀的真相，并将凶手和有关罪犯逮捕法办。
    大家知道，亚非会议的目的，是要促进亚非各国之间的亲善和合作，探讨它们相互间的和共同的利益，建立和增进友好和睦邻关系。美帝国主义把这样一个有助于维护亚非地区和平、促进亚非国家之间友好合作的会议，看成为对它进行扩张和准备侵略战争的莫大障碍。美国国务院不但竭力歪曲这个会议的目的，缩小这个会议的影响，而且利用各种途径和各种手段来破坏这个会议，阻挠这个会议的召开。美帝国主义对于中华人民共和国参加亚非会议，尤其感到恼怒和不安。它害怕许多亚非国家通过亚非会议的广泛接触，会增进对中华人民共和国的了解和友谊，并积极反对美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行为和准备战争的政策。这说明美帝国主义为什么对中华人民共和国参加亚非会议的行动要进行无耻的诬蔑和挑拨，为什么要伙同蒋匪帮特务对我国代表团人员组织卑劣的谋害。
    据可靠的消息，美帝国主义和它的走狗蒋介石匪帮对于破坏亚非会议和谋害中华人民共和国代表团工作人员的计划，比已经发生的飞机爆炸事件还要广泛和严重得多。美蒋特务分子早已在印度尼西亚进行一系列的阴谋活动，其最近的目的就是要破坏亚非会议，准备谋杀以周恩来总理为首的我国代表团人员，威胁积极支持亚非会议的国家，甚至企图颠覆印度尼西亚政府。据印度尼西亚报纸揭露，美国特务分子和蒋匪特务分子正在不断潜入印度尼西亚，从事捣乱和破坏活动。由此可见，盘踞我国领土台湾的美国侵略势力和蒋介石卖国集团，不仅严重地威胁着中华人民共和国的安全，而且严重地威胁着整个亚洲地区的安全和亚洲国家间的友好合作关系。
    亚非会议代表着亚洲和非洲的二十九个国家和十四亿四千万人民，代表着长期受帝国主义侵略的被压迫民族的正义要求，代表着全世界一切拥护和平、反对新战争的人民的愿望。美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的任何破坏阴谋决不能阻挠这一伟大的会议的进行。亚非国家和人民应该提高警惕，并且对美蒋的破坏活动给予坚决的回击。以周恩来总理为首的中国代表团决心为争取亚非会议的顺利进行、为维护亚洲和世界和平而斗争到底，代表团的努力将得到全中国六亿人民全力的支持。
