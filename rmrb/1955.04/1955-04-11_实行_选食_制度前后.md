Before the "selective diet" system was implemented, the slop buckets from the ward kitchen of the Third Division of the Gansu Provincial First People's Hospital were always full of leftover rice and noodles, floating with small pieces of steamed bread, and sometimes even whole buns. Now, there is very little leftover food in the slop buckets here.

In November 1954, the Lanzhou Municipal People's Supervisory Committee conducted an inspection of the waste of grain in the Third Division of the Gansu Provincial First People's Hospital. After the inspection, they studied various aspects and implemented measures to save grain. The most important measure was the implementation of the "selective diet" system. They allowed convalescents to choose their favorite foods in advance, adhering to medical requirements. General convalescents chose every five days, and individual seriously ill patients even selected their food every meal. The hospital formulated recipes based on the convalescents' requests, so that the convalescents could feel more satisfied with their meals, and the cooks could also proactively arrange their work to make the food more palatable.

Before the implementation of the "selective diet", the kitchen cooked more blindly, regardless of whether the patients liked it or not, only according to their own recipe of "no repeating meals in a week, no repeating dishes in a month". Therefore, some patients often took a bite of a full bowl of rice or noodles and threw it aside. The comrades responsible for delivering meals to the wards did not care whether the leftovers were from infectious disease wards or general wards, and dumped them all into the slop bucket.

After the implementation of the "selective diet" system, the blindness of preparing meals was avoided. In order to further reduce waste, the comrades responsible for delivering meals to the patients also put forward their battle slogan: "Give less, run more". Before serving the meals, they first asked the patients how much they could eat. When serving the meals, they portioned the amount of staple food according to the patients' needs in multiple servings. In this way, not only could the patients often eat hot dishes and hot meals, but the amount of staple food delivered was also suitable for the patients' needs. As a result, the situation in the past where a large amount of food was taken into the ward and then taken out was greatly reduced.

However, patients are still patients, and their moods and tastes are changeable. What they originally wanted to eat, they may not want to eat when it is brought to them. There will still be leftover food. How to deal with this food? Nutrition doctors, food administrators, and kitchen comrades have come up with many ways to utilize it together. The cooks cut the whole buns taken back from the general wards into thin slices, baked them into crispy and yellow dried buns, which the patients liked very much; for torn or slightly wet buns, they peeled off the skin, soaked the buns in warm water, rubbed them into a slurry, and mixed them with raw flour to steam buns again. They said, "Building a socialist society requires increasing production and practicing economy. We cannot increase production, but we can also save!" In this way, they save about five catties of rice and flour every day. Over time, the accumulation will be such a large number!

    实行“选食”制度前后
    本报记者　袁良
    几个月以前，甘肃省第一人民医院第三部的病号灶上每天抬出的泔水里面，总是沉着一层大米饭和面条子，漂着一层小馍块，有时候还出现整个馒头。现在这里抬出的泔水里，残剩的食物已经很少了。
    一九五四年十一月间，兰州市人民监察委员会主持检查了甘肃省第一人民医院第三部浪费粮食的情况。经过检查以后，他们从各方面研究并实行了节约粮食的办法。最重要的一项措施是实行“选食”制度。他们让休养员们在符合医疗要求的原则下，事先选择自己喜欢的食物。一般的休养员五天选一次，个别重病号每天甚至每顿饭都进行选食。医院方面根据休养员的要求制定食谱，使休养员对饭食能感到比较满意，使炊事员们也能够主动地安排工作，把饭菜作得更加可口。
    在实行“选食”以前，灶上做饭比较盲目，不管病人喜欢不喜欢，只根据自己“一周不重饭，一月不重菜”的食谱进行安排。因此，经常有些病人把满满一碗米饭或面条吃上一口便丢到一边去。负责向病房送饭的同志也不管这些剩饭是传染病房的还是普通病房的，都一下倒到泔水桶里去。
    实行“选食”制度以后，避免了准备饭食的盲目性。为了进一步减少浪费现象，负责给病人送饭的同志也提出了自己的战斗口号：“少给多跑”。他们在开饭以前先去问病人能够吃多少。开饭的时候，按病人需要的主食数量分次盛送。这样一来，不但病人可以经常吃到热菜、热饭，而且送来的主食的数量适合病人需要。结果像过去那样大量食物拿进病房再拿出来的情况便大大减少了。
    但是，病人终归是病人，他们的心情、口味是多变的。原来想吃的东西，端到跟前去以后，可能又不想吃了。这样剩下来的食物还是会有的。对这些食物怎样处理呢？营养大夫、伙食管理员和厨房的同志们又共同想出许多办法去利用它。炊事员们把从普通病房拿回来的馒头，囫囵的切成薄薄的馍片，烤成又焦又黄的馍干，病人挺喜欢吃；搿开的或是湿了皮的馒头，他们把皮剥去，用温水把馒头泡开，搓成浆状，又和生面掺合起来蒸馒头。他们说：“建设社会主义社会需要增产节约，我们不能增产，可是也能节约哟！”就这样，他们每天节省下来的米、面有五斤左右。日久天长，累积起来将是一个多么大的数字呀！
