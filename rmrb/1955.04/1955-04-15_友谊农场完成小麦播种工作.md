    Friendship Farm Completes Wheat Sowing
    The state-owned Friendship Farm has completed the spring wheat sowing on April 10th, at the opportune time.
    During this spring sowing, the farm mobilized fifteen tractors and nearly fifty seed drills. In just seven days, they completed the sowing of two thousand hectares of spring wheat; among them, over 85% of the land adopted the cross-sowing method.
    Because some of the tractor operators were new graduates from schools, and most of the implement operators were newly selected, they lacked experience in operating tractors and seed drills. At the beginning of sowing, many tractor contract teams failed to meet the sowing quota. After diligently studying during work, actively learning from Soviet experts, finding ways to shorten the time for seed drills to add seeds, reducing parking accidents, and continuously improving work efficiency, all contract teams exceeded the sowing quota in the last two days of sowing. During the sowing period, the Soviet experts who helped build the farm personally inspected the fields every day, and when problems were found, they were solved on the spot. Because the quality of land preparation in the fifth plot was poor and the soil clods were large, the marking device was difficult to use during sowing. A Soviet expert personally drove a tractor and sowed the first row straightly, giving the tractor operators a model to follow. (Our correspondent in Harbin)

    友谊农场完成小麦播种工作
    国营友谊农场已经在四月十日适时地完成了春小麦播种工作。
    这次春播中，农场出动了十五台拖拉机和近五十台播种机，仅用七天时间，就完成了二千公顷春小麦的播种工作；其中百分之八十五以上的地还采用了交叉播种法。
    由于一部分拖拉机手新从学校毕业，大部分农具手是新选拔的，缺乏操作拖拉机、播种机的经验，开始播种时，不少拖拉机包车组达不到播种定额。经过在工作中认真研究，积极向苏联专家学习，设法缩短播种机添种籽的时间，减少停车事故，不断提高工作效率，到播种的后两天，所有包车组都超过了播种定额。播种期间，帮助建场的苏联专家们每天都亲自下地巡视，发现问题，就地帮助解决。第五号地块因整地质量较差，土块较大，播种时画印器不好使用，一位苏联专家便亲自驾驶拖拉机笔直地播下了第一行，给了拖拉机手们一个可以遵循的样子。（本报驻哈尔滨记者）
