    Nanyuan Agricultural Machinery Station in the Spring Plowing Season

    This year, the Nanyuan Agricultural Machinery Station in the suburbs of Beijing plans to cultivate 100,000 mu of land for two state-owned farms, two afforestation stations, one collective farm, and twenty-three agricultural production cooperatives, an increase of three times compared to last year.

    In order to meet the needs of agricultural production development, the Agricultural Machinery Station has also undertaken the task of training young activists and senior primary school graduates from nearby agricultural production cooperatives to become skilled tractor drivers.
