    Telegram to the Families of the Victims of the Indian "Kashmir Princess" Plane Crash
    To the Families of the Victims of the Indian "Kashmir Princess" Plane Crash, via Indian International Airlines:

    The explosion and crash of the Indian "Kashmir Princess" plane into the sea proves that the bloody hands of the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek special agents not only plotted to murder the personnel of the Chinese and Vietnamese delegations attending the Asian-African Conference and the journalists from China, Poland, and Austria, but also caused the innocent death of outstanding Indian mechanics who were loyal to their duties. As we hold a memorial meeting for the victims of the "Kashmir Princess" plane crash in the capital, Beijing, today, we extend our condolences and sympathy to you—the families of the deceased outstanding Indian mechanics.

    北京各界人民追悼“四·一一”遇难烈士大会
    致印度“克什米尔公主号”飞机遇难人员家属电印度国际航空公司转“克什米尔公主号”飞机遇难人员家属：
    印度“克什米尔公主号”飞机爆炸坠海事件证明美蒋特务的血手不仅谋害了出席亚非会议的中、越代表团人员和中、波、奥三国的记者，而且还使忠于自己职守的印度优秀的机务工作者无辜罹难。我们今天在首都北京举行“克什米尔公主号”飞机遇难人员的追悼大会时，谨向你们——遇难的印度优秀的机务工作者的家属，表示吊唁和慰问。
    北京各界人民追悼“四·一一”遇难烈士大会
