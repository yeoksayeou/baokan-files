Mr. Consul General, Ladies and Gentlemen, Comrades:
    I am instructed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, in accordance with the provisions of Item 2 and Item 3 of the exchange of notes between Mr. Zhang Hanfu, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country, and Mr. N. Raghavan, Indian Ambassador to China, on April 29, 1954, and the subsequent arrangements discussed between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country and the Indian Embassy in China, to jointly handle the acceptance and transfer of postal and telecommunications and relay station work operated by India in the Tibet region of China with Mr. Menon, the Indian Consul General in Lhasa. Since November 1954, our side has sent officials to the area from Gyantse to Yatung to work with Indian government officials in counting equipment at each station and bureau along the way, understanding the business, and estimating the value of relay station equipment. Thanks to the timely consultation between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country and the Indian Embassy in China to resolve various major issues in the work, and even more so to the assistance and cooperation of Indian officials in the inventory work, the first stage of the inventory work has been successfully completed. Today, we are signing the protocol. From today onwards, the postal, telegraph, and telephone enterprises and their equipment, and the twelve relay stations and their equipment, operated by the Indian government in the Tibet region of China have been officially transferred to the ownership of the Chinese government. This is the most obvious manifestation of the concrete implementation of the agreement and exchange of notes signed by China and India on April 29, 1954. It is a powerful proof of the friendly cooperation between the governments and peoples of China and India. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to all the officials from the Indian government who participated in this handover work, especially Consul General Menon, for their cooperation. Finally, please allow me to warmly congratulate the successful completion of this handover work here.

    我政府驻西藏代表外事帮办杨公素的讲话总领事先生、各位先生、各位同志：
    我奉中华人民共和国外交部的指示，按照一九五四年四月二十九日我国外交部章汉夫副部长和印度驻华大使赖嘉文先生互换照会中第二项及第三项的规定，及后来我国外交部和印度驻华大使馆商谈的办法，和印度驻拉萨总领事梅农先生共同办理接收和移交印度在中国西藏地方的邮电和驿站工作。我方从一九五四年十一月份起即派官员赴江孜至亚东一带，会同印度政府的官员在沿途各站、各局清点器材，了解熟悉业务和进行驿站设备的估价工作等。由于我国外交部和印度驻华大使馆及时的会商解决了工作中各种主要的问题，更由于印方官员在清点工作中的协助与合作，使第一阶段的清点工作，业已顺利完成。今天我们双方在议定书上签字，自今天起，印度政府在中国西藏地方所经营的邮政、电报和电话等企业及其设备和十二个驿站及其设备等，已正式移交给中国政府所有。这是中印两国切实地执行双方一九五四年四月二十九日所订的协定和互换照会的最明显的表现。也是中印两国政府和人民之间的友好合作的有力的证明，我愿乘此机会对印度政府方面参加这次移交工作的全体官员特别是总领事梅农先生的合作表示衷心的感谢。最后请允许我在这里热烈地庆贺这一移交工作的胜利完成。
