    Actively Develop the Work of the Young Pioneers of China
    The Young Pioneers of China has been established for five years. The Young Pioneers already has ten million members. The Young Pioneers has played an active role in coordinating with school education, developing children's intelligence and physical strength, enlivening children's extracurricular life, and cultivating children's moral character. The beneficial activities of the Young Pioneers have been widely praised by people from all walks of life and parents, and the Young Pioneers has become an organization loved by the vast number of children.
    However, there are still many shortcomings in the work of the Young Pioneers. One of the most prominent problems at present is that the development of the team's organization is too slow. There are approximately 76 million children of suitable age for the team nationwide (including 38.5 million students of suitable age in primary and secondary schools), but there are only 10 million Young Pioneers, accounting for only 13 percent of the nation's children of suitable age. To this day, many schools have not yet established teams, and schools that have established teams generally have not paid attention to the regular development of the team. In particular, the requirements for joining the team are too strict for young children, inappropriately stipulating many overly high standards, and the procedures for joining the team are complicated, which makes the vast number of young children eager to join the team unable to join for a long time, greatly dampening their enthusiasm and initiative. At the same time, the life of the team is not active enough, with too few activities and monotonous content, and it cannot fully meet the diverse needs of young children. These problems should be effectively solved.
    The Young Pioneers is a broad-based educational organization for children. The purpose of establishing the Young Pioneers is to unite and educate the vast number of children with communist spirit, so that they become outstanding children of the new China who love the motherland, love the people, love labor, love science, cherish public property, and are healthy, lively, brave, and honest. The Young Pioneers has set a clear goal for children: "Be prepared: to fight for the realization of communism and the great cause of the motherland!" This is a huge force to encourage children to move forward. A person has a lofty ideal from a young age, which is the beginning of the establishment of a communist worldview. Children like collective activities, and the Young Pioneers meets the children's requirements, organizes them together, and lives an organized and rich collective life, which can cultivate children's collectivist thinking and inspire children's initiative and creativity.
    According to the regulations of the Constitution of the Young Pioneers of China, any child of suitable age who voluntarily applies, abides by the Constitution, and is approved can join the team. We must never ask Young Pioneers to play a "backbone" or "leading" role like party members or league members; if we think this way or do this, it would be subjective and extremely wrong. The more widely the Young Pioneers unites and educates children, the greater the role of the team will be. In order to better unite and educate the new generation and meet the requirements of the existing vast number of children of suitable age to join the team, we must actively develop the work of the Young Pioneers and extensively and greatly develop the organization of the Young Pioneers.
    In carrying out the work of the Young Pioneers, we should correctly understand and treat children. Many comrades only like "gentle and obedient" and "honest and obedient" "good children," and regard those who are lively and active and "naughty and disobedient" as "bad children," and think that they cannot join the team. This is a very harmful view. Old education can only train students to be slaves to meet the needs of the exploiting class to rule the people; socialist education is to cultivate children into conscious and creative builders and masters of the new society. Children are innocent and naive, and are naturally lively and active, which is not bad. Some children are overly naughty, often because adults do not educate them enough, and lack normal cultural, recreational, and sports activities. We should be good at educating and guiding children, arranging their studies and extracurricular life, so that they can exert their full energy in beneficial activities. Here, we should pay attention to the personality training of children, and we should cultivate the personality of socialist new people in children, that is, to cultivate them to become resolute and lively, unafraid of difficulties, and full of creative spirit, so that they can undertake the cause of defending and building the motherland in the future. If we interfere with children everywhere and scold them for some of their shortcomings, it will suppress and restrain the lively and active personality of children, and turn them into rigid, cowardly, and obedient "old-fashioned children," which is dangerous. As for a few children who have more shortcomings because they are influenced by old ideas and behaviors, even if they are not approved to join the team temporarily for educational reasons, they should be patiently educated. We should believe that in our country, every child can be well educated.
    The life of the Young Pioneers should be very lively. Many schools do not understand the significance and purpose of carrying out the activities of the Young Pioneers, and do not care about and organize the extracurricular life of children, and rarely study and improve the content of the team's activities. Many schools treat children in the same way as adults, and the team's activities are full of lengthy and abstract reports and discussions, no wonder the children feel bored. Some schools, when organizing the team's activities, almost all do it all by themselves, rarely letting the children "use their hands and brains" and not giving play to the children's initiative, which should also be corrected. In the future, while developing team organizations, all localities should comprehensively care for the lives of children, and carry out various activities according to the characteristics, interests, and requirements of children, regularly hold lively team meetings, organize various subject groups, sports teams, choirs, theater troupes, organize military sports competitions, visits, travel, and visits, hold children's literary and artistic performances and exhibitions of scientific and artistic works, organize activities such as "doing one thing for the families of revolutionary martyrs," and organize public welfare labor suitable for children such as planting sunflowers and collecting tree seeds. In the team's activities, we should pay attention to giving full play to the children's initiative and cultivating their brave and lively spirit. Only when the team's activities are widely carried out can children truly love their organization and receive vivid communist education.
    Our Party and government have always been concerned about the healthy growth of children. Doing a good job in the Young Pioneers is not only the responsibility of the Communist Youth League, but also the common responsibility of all educational administrative departments, all primary and secondary schools, children's education institutions, and the vast number of people from all walks of life. The nation's 1.7 million primary school teachers are the main force in cultivating the new generation and helping to do a good job in the team, and without their hard educational work and unremitting efforts, it would be difficult to do this work well. In order to meet the needs of the team's development, youth league organizations at all levels should conscientiously implement the Party's entrustment to themselves, strengthen the regular leadership of the team's work, regard children's work as one of their main tasks, and fully organize social forces to do a good job in this work; in particular, do a good job in the selection and training of counselors, help them solve specific difficulties in their work, and continuously summarize and exchange experience. Only in this way can we effectively push the work of the Young Pioneers forward.

### 积极开展中国少年先锋队的工作

    积极开展中国少年先锋队的工作
    中国少年先锋队建队到现在已有五年。少先队已经拥有一千万队员。少先队在配合学校教育，发展儿童的智力和体力，活跃儿童的课余生活，培养儿童的道德品质等方面，都起了积极的作用。少先队的有益的活动，已受到社会人士和家长们的普遍赞许，少先队已成为广大少年儿童所热爱的组织了。
    但在少先队工作中还有很多缺点。当前最突出的问题之一，是队的组织发展过于缓慢。全国适合队龄的儿童约七千六百万人（其中包括中、小学校适合队龄的学生三千八百五十万人），而少年先锋队员只有一千万人，只占全国适合队龄儿童百分之十三。直到现在，还有许多学校没有建队，已建队的学校一般地也没有重视队的经常发展工作。特别是对入队的少年儿童要求过严，不恰当地规定许多过高的标准，入队手续繁杂，使广大渴望参加队的少年儿童，长期不能入队，大大挫伤了他们的上进心和积极性。同时，队的生活也不够活跃，活动太少，内容枯燥，还不能完全适应少年儿童多方面的需要。这些问题都是应当切实加以解决的。
    少先队是一个广泛性的少年儿童的教育组织。建立少先队的目的是要以共产主义精神团结和教育广大少年儿童，使他们成为爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物和健壮、活泼、勇敢、诚实的新中国的优秀儿女。少先队为少年儿童规定了明确的奋斗目标：“准备着：为实现共产主义和祖国的伟大事业而奋斗！”这对于鼓舞少年儿童前进是一个巨大的力量。一个人从幼小的时候就有了远大理想，这正是共产主义人生观建立的开始。儿童喜欢集体活动，少先队适应儿童的要求，把他们组织在一起，过着有组织的、丰富的集体生活，就能培养儿童集体主义的思想，启发儿童的积极性和创造性。
    根据中国少年先锋队队章的规定，凡适合队龄的少年儿童，只要自愿申请，遵守队章，经过批准就可以入队。我们决不应该要求少先队员同党员、团员一样起“骨干”“带头”作用；如果这样想，这样做，那就是主观主义的，是极其错误的。少先队团结教育的儿童愈广泛，队的作用也就愈大。为了更好地团结教育新的一代，满足现有广大适合队龄的少年儿童的入队要求，我们必须积极开展少先队的工作，广泛地、大量地发展少先队的组织。
    在开展少先队的工作当中，应当正确地认识和对待少年儿童。有许多同志只喜欢“斯文规矩”、“老实听话”的“好孩子”，而把那些活泼好动，
  “顽皮不听话”的看成是“坏孩子”，认为他们不能入队。这是一种十分有害的观点。旧教育只能把学生训练成奴仆，以适应剥削阶级统治人民的需要；社会主义教育是要把儿童培养成自觉的、有创造性的新社会的建设者和主人。少年儿童天真幼稚，生性活泼好动，这并没有什么不好。有些少年儿童所以过分调皮，往往是由于大人对他们教育不够，和缺乏正常的文化娱乐和体育活动。我们应当善于教育和引导儿童，安排他们的学习和业余生活，让他们把饱满的精力发挥到有益的活动中去。这里，我们应当注意少年儿童的性格锻炼，应当培养少年儿童的社会主义新人的性格，即培养他们成为刚毅活泼、不怕困难、富有创造精神的人，才能使他们在将来担当起保卫和建设祖国的事业。如果对儿童处处干涉，对他们的一些缺点动辄给以训斥，这就会使儿童活泼好动的性格受到压抑和束缚，而使他们变成呆板懦弱、百依百顺、“少年老成”的人，这是危险的。至于少数少年儿童因为受了旧的思想行为的影响，缺点比较多，为了教育上的要求，即使暂时不批准他们入队，也应该耐心地教育他们。我们应该相信，在我们国家里，每个儿童都是可以教育得好的。
    少先队的生活应该是非常活泼的。有许多学校对开展少先队活动的意义和目的认识不够，不去关心和组织少年儿童的课余生活，很少研究改进队的活动内容。不少学校用对待成年人的办法对待少年儿童，在队的活动中，充满着冗长、抽象的报告和讨论，无怪儿童们感到枯燥乏味。也有的学校在组织队的活动的时候，几乎全由大人一手包办，很少让儿童自己去“动手动脑”，不去发挥儿童的主动性，这也是应当纠正的。今后各地在发展队组织的同时，应当全面地关心少年儿童的生活，根据少年儿童的特点、兴趣和要求，开展多种多样的活动，经常举行生动的队的集会，组织各种学科小组、球队、合唱队、剧团，组织军事体育比赛、参观、旅行、访问，举办少年儿童文艺会演和科学、艺术作品展览会，组织“为烈军属做一件事”的活动，组织种向日葵、采集树种等适合少年儿童的公益劳动。在队的活动中，要注意充分发挥少年儿童的主动性，培养他们的勇敢活泼的精神。只有使队的活动广泛地开展起来，儿童才能真正热爱自己的组织，并受到生动的共产主义的教育。
    我们的党和政府对于少年儿童的健全成长，历来是关怀的。做好少先队工作不仅是青年团的责任，也是所有教育行政部门，所有中、小学校，儿童教育机关和广大社会人士共同的责任。全国一百七十万小学教师是培养新的一代、帮助做好队的工作的主力军，没有他们的辛勤的教育工作和坚持不懈的努力，就很难把这一工作作好。为了适应队的发展需要，各级青年团组织应该认真地执行党对自己的委托，加强对队的工作的经常领导，把少年儿童工作当作自己的一项主要工作，充分组织社会力量来作好这一工作；特别是作好辅导员选聘和训练工作，帮助他们解决工作中的具体困难，不断地总结和交流经验。只有这样，我们才能够把少先队的工作切实地向前推进一步。
