Wuhan Dike Construction Project Proceeding Intensly

The peach blossom flood season has begun. The Wuhan dike construction project is proceeding intensely. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued instructions on strengthening water conservancy work and conducted a general inspection of the quality and progress of the dike project.

On March 31st, the Yangtze River Daily, the organ of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, published Chairman Mao's inscription for the victory of the Wuhan people in the 1954 flood control struggle: "Congratulations to the Wuhan people for overcoming the 1954 flood, and we must also prepare to overcome equally serious floods that may occur in the future." Chairman Mao's inscription inspired the labor enthusiasm of more than 40,000 dike workers and cadres participating in the dike repair. The dike workers fighting on the Changfeng North and South Dikes swore to Chairman Mao, determined to repair the dike before the "May Day" holiday and open the highway on the top of the dike to traffic. In order to save time, many dike workers put forward the slogan of rushing repairs by "seizing sunny days, taking advantage of cloudy days, and grabbing rainy days." The dike workers on the lower section of the Hankou riverside dike, with the heroic spirit of "who is a hero, who is a good man, let's compare in the wind and rain," carried out rain-resistant construction. The dike workers who were renovating the Longkou dangerous project on Zhanggong Dike worked overnight to fill earthwork under the illumination of electric lights and gas lamps. After the Wuchang Wutai Sluice released the water accumulated inside the dike, it is now blocking the gap and restoring the dike. More than 3,000 dike workers are stepping up construction in three shifts day and night. Along the riverside outside Hanzheng Street in Hankou, revetments, waterproof walls, and dams are being built. Labor competitions have been launched successively at various dike construction sites throughout the city.

    武汉堤防建设工程紧张进行
    桃汛开始了。武汉的堤防建设工程正在紧张进行。中共武汉市委会最近发出了关于加强水利工作的指示，并对堤防工程的质量和进度进行了普遍的检查。
    三月三十一日，中共武汉市委会机关报长江日报刊登了毛主席为武汉人民一九五四年防汛斗争胜利的题词：“庆贺武汉人民战胜了一九五四年的洪水，还要准备战胜今后可能发生的同样严重的洪水”。毛主席的题词鼓舞了参加修堤的四万多名堤工和干部的劳动热情。战斗在长丰南北垸的堤工们向毛主席宣誓，决心在“五一”节前修好垸堤，并使堤顶公路通车。为了争取时间，许多堤工们提出了“抓晴天、赶阴天、抢雨天”的抢修口号。汉口沿河下段堤上的堤工们，以“谁英雄、谁好汉，风雨当中比比看”的英雄气概，进行抗雨施工。翻修张公堤龙口险工工程的堤工们，在电灯和汽灯的照耀下连夜赶填土方。武昌武泰闸放出堤内积水后，正在堵口复堤，三千多名堤工分日夜三班加紧施工。汉口汉正街外沿河一带正兴建护坡、防水墙和大堤。全市各个堤防工地已经先后展开劳动竞赛。　（本报集体通讯员长江日报编辑部）
