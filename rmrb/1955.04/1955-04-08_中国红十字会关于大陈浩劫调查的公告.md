    Announcement by the Red Cross Society of China Regarding the Catastrophe of Dachen
  　After learning of the shocking crime of the Chiang Kai-shek army, under the instigation of the United States and the protection of the U.S. military, forcibly removing more than 20,000 peaceful residents of Dachen and other islands to Taiwan, the Red Cross Society of China organized an investigation team to conduct on-the-spot investigations in Dachen and other islands. The results of the investigation confirmed the aforementioned crimes of the U.S.-Chiang forces. The Red Cross Society has always taken aiding the sick, rescuing the wounded, and saving the people from suffering as its purpose, and upholding humanitarianism as its tradition. Therefore, the Red Cross Society of China believes it is necessary to publish the investigation report to the world.
                                    President of the Red Cross Society of China, Li Dequan

    中国红十字会关于大陈浩劫调查的公告
  　中国红十字会获悉蒋介石军队在美国指使和美军掩护下，劫运大陈等岛二万多和平居民到台湾去的惊人罪行后，组织调查团去大陈等岛进行实地调查。调查结果证实了美蒋军队的上述罪行。红十字会既以扶病、救伤、拯救人民于苦难为其宗旨，以维护人道主义为其传统，因此，中国红十字会认为有必要把调查报告书向全世界公布。
