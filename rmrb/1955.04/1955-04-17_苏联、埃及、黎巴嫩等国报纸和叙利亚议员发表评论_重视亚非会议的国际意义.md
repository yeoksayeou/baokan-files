Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Moscow, 16th: Moscow newspapers published articles commenting on the upcoming Asian-African Conference in Bandung. "Pravda" published an article by Pastukhov on the 16th, entitled "An Important Political Event in the Lives of Asian and African Peoples."

　　The article said that the convening of the Bandung Conference proves the tremendous changes that have taken place in Asia recently. The convening of the conference aroused the displeasure of the US ruling clique.

　　American imperialists launched a frantic propaganda campaign to attack the convening of the Asian-African Conference. American partners in military aggression groups like the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization also obediently participated in this American propaganda. However, the American plot to sabotage the Bandung Conference was thwarted.

　　The U.S. State Department then convened an "emergency meeting" to determine its attitude toward the Asian-African Conference. The essence of the "new attitude" was to have America’s partners who accepted the invitation to attend the Asian-African Conference conspire to carry out sabotage activities both during and outside of the formal meetings. A meeting of American diplomats held in Bangkok (Thailand) not long ago formulated detailed instructions related to certain countries. According to the Indian weekly "Blitz," this meeting instructed representatives of countries dependent on the United States to obstruct discussions at the Bandung Conference regarding the condemnation of the imperialist colonial system, Asian military alliances and blocs, to obstruct conference participants from agreeing to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and to oppose the prohibition of atomic weapons.

　　The article then wrote that the warm support the Bandung Conference received among the broad masses of the people of Asia and Africa and all peace-loving people in the world, as well as the increasing international prestige of the People's Republic of China, aroused great hatred from American imperialists and their Chiang Kai-shek running dogs. American and Chiang Kai-shek secret service organizations carried out despicable sabotage activities and created the Indian plane crash incident, on which were personnel and reporters of the delegation of the People's Republic of China to the Asian-African Conference, personnel of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Polish reporters, etc.

　　The article concluded by writing that the Soviet people have friendship and sympathy for the people of Asian and African countries who are heroically fighting for freedom and independence, and the Soviet people congratulate the Bandung Conference on its success.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th: TASS dispatch, 14th: Egyptian and Lebanese newspapers welcome the upcoming Asian-African Conference and demand the prevention of imperialist plots to sabotage the conference.

　　Egypt's "Al-Tahrir" published an editorial saying that the people of Asian and African countries demand freedom and independence. They are unwilling to continue to be victims of imperialism, and they will not allow colonialists to plunder them again. They do not agree to become cannon fodder for imperialists.

　　Egypt's "Al-Akhbar" published an editorial saying that representatives of Asian and African countries, which account for half of the world's total population, will gather at the Bandung Conference. This conference is fundamentally different from international conferences usually convened by Western countries. The conferences convened by Western countries are in order to reach agreements among themselves on dividing spheres of influence and to decide the fate of other countries without the participation of other countries.

　　Ibrahim Amir published an article in "Al-Tahrir" calling for attention to the propaganda carried out by imperialists to sabotage the Asian-African Conference. Ibrahim Amir said that in the United States, a special committee has been formed by representatives of the Department of the Army, the Department of State, and propaganda organs ordered to slander the conference. Ibrahim Amir said that American news agencies are spreading all kinds of fabricated remarks among the people of Asian and African countries, with the aim of hindering the unity of these people.

　　Lebanon's "Al-Telgraf" published a commentary saying that British and American imperialists will do their best to obstruct the smooth progress of the Asian-African Conference and prevent the conference from passing resolutions unfavorable to imperialist countries. The commentary said that, however, it can be predicted that all these attempts by British and American imperialists will be defeated.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: TASS dispatch from Beirut, 15th: "An-Nour" reported that Syrian parliamentarian Khaled Bakdash said that the upcoming Asian-African Conference in Bandung "has extremely important significance."

　　Bakdash continued: "Some newspapers are attempting to belittle the significance of this conference. This is undoubtedly directly instigated by imperialist elements and reflects the dissatisfaction of imperialists and their flatterers with this conference. Imperialists, especially American imperialists, are very dissatisfied with the fact that Asian and African countries are holding a conference without their permission and are not letting them participate... The great significance of this conference can be proved by the fact that imperialists are fiercely resisting it. At first, American imperialists just wanted to prohibit it from being held. After this plan failed, they are now attempting to sabotage it from within.

　　At this conference, two tendencies will be manifested. One tendency will try to keep Asia and Africa bound by imperialism and subject to its control, and the other tendency will strive for final liberation from the shackles of imperialism. Those who manifest the latter tendency will include the people of the People's Republic of China, India, Indonesia, Burma, and other countries. Imperialists are aware of this situation and, with the help of their people, will do everything possible to make the work of the conference go in a direction suitable for the purposes of Washington imperialism.

　　The Syrian people hope that the Syrian government's attitude at the Bandung Conference will be absolutely clear. This attitude should reflect the government's declaration, in which the government had pledged to adopt a national policy based on opposing conventions and opposing dragging Syria into imperialist military blocs."

### 苏联、埃及、黎巴嫩等国报纸和叙利亚议员发表评论  重视亚非会议的国际意义

    苏联、埃及、黎巴嫩等国报纸和叙利亚议员发表评论
    重视亚非会议的国际意义
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社莫斯科十六日讯：莫斯科报纸刊载评论即将在万隆举行的亚非会议的文章。“真理报”十六日刊载了帕斯图霍夫的一篇文章，题目是“亚非各国人民生活中的一件重要的政治事件”。
    文章说，万隆会议的召开证明亚洲近来发生了巨大的变化，会议的召开引起了美国统治集团的恼怒。
    美国帝国主义者展开了一个猖狂的宣传运动来攻击亚非会议的召开。东南亚条约组织之类的军事侵略集团中的美国小伙伴也顺从地参加了美国的这种宣传。但是，美国破坏万隆会议的阴谋遭到了挫折。
    美国国务院于是召开了一次“紧急会议”来确定对亚非会议的态度，“新态度”的实质是，使接受邀请出席亚非会议的美国的伙伴阴谋在正式会议上和会外进行破坏活动。不久以前在曼谷（泰国）举行的美国外交人员会议详细拟定了对一些国家有关的指令。据印度“闪电”周报报道，这次会议责成依附美国的国家的代表在万隆会议上阻挠讨论有关谴责帝国主义殖民制度、亚洲军事同盟和集团的问题，阻挠会议参加者赞同和平共处五项原则，反对禁止原子武器。
    文章接着写道，万隆会议在亚非广大人民群众和全世界爱好和平的人们当中所受到的热烈支持，以及中华人民共和国的日益提高的国际威望，引起了美国帝国主义者及其蒋介石走狗的极大仇视。美蒋特务组织进行了卑鄙的破坏活动，制造了印度飞机失事事件，在这架飞机上乘着前往万隆参加亚非会议的中华人民共和国代表团人员和记者、越南民主共和国代表团人员、波兰记者等。
    文章最后写道，苏联人民对正在为争取自由和独立而英勇斗争的亚非各国人民怀着友谊和同情，苏联人民祝贺万隆会议成功。
    新华社十五日讯　据塔斯社十四日讯：埃及和黎巴嫩报纸欢迎即将举行的亚非会议，并且要求防止帝国主义破坏这个会议的阴谋。
    埃及“解放报”发表社论说，亚非国家的人民要求自由和独立。他们不愿继续成为帝国主义的牺牲者，也将不容许殖民主义者再掠夺他们，他们不同意成为帝国主义者的炮灰。
    埃及“消息报”发表社论说，占世界总人口一半的亚非国家的代表们将在万隆会议上聚首。这个会议根本不同于西方国家通常所召开的国际会议，西方国家所召开的会议是为了要在它们自己中间达成划分势力范围的协议和在没有其他国家参加的情况下来决定其他国家的命运。
    易卜拉欣·阿密尔在“解放报”上发表了一篇文章，要求注意帝国主义者进行的破坏亚非会议的宣传。易卜拉欣·阿密尔说，在美国，已经由陆军部、国务院和奉命进行诬蔑这次会议的宣传机关的代表组成了一个特别委员会。易卜拉欣·阿密尔说，美国各通讯社正在亚非国家的人民中间散布各种各样捏造的言论，目的是要阻碍这些人民的团结。
    黎巴嫩“阿特—塔尔比亚报”发表评论说，英美帝国主义者将会竭力阻挠亚非会议的顺利进行，并且不让会议通过对帝国主义国家不利的决议。评论说，但是，可以预言，英美帝国主义者的这一切企图都将遭受失败。
    新华社十六日讯　塔斯社贝鲁特十五日讯：“努尔报”报道，叙利亚议会议员哈勒德·巴克达斯说，即将在万隆举行的亚非会议“具有极端重大的重要性”。
    巴克达斯继续说：“一些报纸企图贬低这个会议的意义，这毫无疑问地是受帝国主义分子直接授意的，并且反映了帝国主义者和他们的奉承者对这个会议的不满。帝国主义者，特别是美帝国主义者，是十分不满意这个事实的：亚非国家没有得到他们的准许就举行会议，并且不让他们参加……这个会议的重大意义可以从帝国主义者进行激烈抵抗这个事实得到证明。最初，美帝国主义者只是想禁止它举行。这种计划失败后，他们现在企图从内部加以破坏。
    在这个会议上，将表现出两种倾向。一种倾向将力图使亚洲和非洲继续受帝国主义的束缚，并且受它的支配，另一种倾向将努力争取从帝国主义的枷锁下最后解放出来。表现后一种倾向的将有中华人民共和国、印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸以及其他国家的人民。帝国主义者意识到这种情况，将在他们的人的帮助下，尽一切力量来使会议的工作沿着适合华盛顿帝国主义的目的的方向走。
    叙利亚人民希望叙利亚政府在万隆会议上的态度绝对明确。这种态度应当反映出政府的宣言，在这个宣言中，政府曾保证要采取以反对公约和反对把叙利亚拉入帝国主义军事集团的政策为基础的民族政策。”
