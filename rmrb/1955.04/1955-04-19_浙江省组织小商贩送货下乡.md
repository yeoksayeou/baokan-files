Zhejiang Province organizes small vendors to deliver goods to the countryside

More than one hundred grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in twenty counties including Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, and Yiwu in Zhejiang Province have organized thousands of small vendors to adopt the method of "delivering goods to the countryside and purchasing from door to door" to supply farmers with native fertilizers and small farm tools, supporting spring plowing and production. From the beginning of January to March 20, the province's grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives supplied farmers with more than 1.2 million dan of native fertilizer, an increase of 2.6 times over the same period in 1954; the supply of various small farm tools to farmers was more than 500,000 pieces, an increase of more than 17 percent over the same period in 1954; a considerable portion of which was supplied to farmers through small vendors. In February, the Qianqing District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shaoxing County organized 86 small vendors. By the end of March, the purchase of miscellaneous hair and bones alone amounted to more than 11,000 jin, which was five times more than the amount purchased by the supply and marketing cooperative stores in the past. Through these small vendors, more than 150 pieces of various small farm tools were supplied to farmers in three days. In the past, farmers had to queue up to buy "crab paste" fishery fertilizer at the Luotuo District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Zhenhai County, and farmers who came from afar to buy "crab paste" had to delay half a day or a day. Recently, the supply and marketing cooperative organized more than a dozen local small vendors to deliver "crab paste" to the countryside separately, saving farmers a lot of time and being welcomed by the farmers.

    浙江省组织小商贩送货下乡
    浙江省绍兴、萧山、义乌等二十个县的一百多个农村基层供销合作社，组织上千名小商小贩采取“送货下乡，上门收购”的办法，供应农民土杂肥和小型农具，支援了春耕生产。从一月初到三月二十日止，全省基层供销合作社供应到农民手中的土杂肥有一百二十多万担，比一九五四年同时期增加了二点六倍；供应给农民的各种小型农具有五十多万件，比一九五四年同时期增加百分之十七以上；其中有不少的一部分是通过小商小贩供应给农民的。绍兴县钱清区供销合作社在二月间组织起八十六名小商小贩，到三月底，仅收购杂毛、杂骨两项土杂肥就有一万一千多斤，比过去供销合作社门市收购量增加了五倍。通过这些小商贩，在三天内供应给农民的各种小农具，有一百五十多件。过去农民到镇海县骆驼区供销合作社购买渔杂肥“蟹浆”时要排队，远道来买“蟹浆”的农民，要耽误半天或一天的时间。最近供销合作社组织当地十多个小商小贩分别下乡送“蟹浆”，节省了农民许多时间，受到农民们的欢迎。　（沈伯欣）
