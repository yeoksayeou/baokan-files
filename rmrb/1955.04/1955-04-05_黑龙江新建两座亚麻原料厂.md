Two new flax processing plants, built in Hulan County and Acheng County, Heilongjiang Province, areas rich in flax production, went into operation on April 1st.

　　The main factory buildings of these two flax processing plants were designed with Soviet assistance. The installed equipment is also the latest Soviet products from 1954. For example, the flax breaking and scutching combined machine in the scutching workshop feeds dry flax with stalks from one end, and long fibers come out the other end. Some workshops are also equipped with electric circulating cranes to replace manual transportation. The factory buildings are equipped with complete dust removal and ventilation equipment. These two flax processing plants are very close to the Harbin Flax Textile Factory, making it very convenient to supply raw materials. After these two flax processing plants implement three-shift production, they can supply 2,000 tons of long fibers and more than 2,400 tons of short fibers annually.

    黑龙江新建两座亚麻原料厂
    在黑龙江省盛产亚麻的呼兰县和阿城县新建成的两座亚麻原料厂，已在四月一日投入生产。
    这两座亚麻原料厂的主要厂房，都是苏联帮助设计的。安装的设备也都是苏联一九五四年最新产品。如制麻车间的揉麻打麻联合机，把带着秆的干麻从这头喂进去，再从那头出来时，就成为长纤维了。有的车间还装有电动循环吊车，代替体力运输。厂房内都设有完善的除尘通风设备。这两座亚麻原料厂离哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂很近，供应原料很方便。这两座亚麻原料厂实行三班生产以后，每年可供给两千吨长纤维和两千四百多吨短纤维。（本报驻哈尔滨记者）
