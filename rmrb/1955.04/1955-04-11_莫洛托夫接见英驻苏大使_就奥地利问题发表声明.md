    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 9th -- TASS reported: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov received British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir William Hayter, on April 9th and issued a statement on the Austrian question.

    The statement pointed out that as early as the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference in early 1954, the Soviet government put forward a proposal advocating the earliest possible solution to the Austrian question, advocating measures to prevent a new German-Austrian merger, and preventing Austria from being involved in alliances or military blocs against any country that participated in the war against Germany and the war to liberate Austria. However, at the Berlin Conference, due to reasons beyond the control of the Soviet Union, no agreement was reached on the conclusion of an Austrian peace treaty, and the Austrian question was not resolved.

    In August of the same year, the Soviet government proposed that the ambassadors of the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and the United States hold a meeting in Vienna, with the participation of an Austrian representative, to study issues related to the draft Austrian peace treaty and the conclusion of the Austrian peace treaty, but this meeting did not take place.

    The statement continued: Due to the need to maintain and consolidate European peace, the Soviet government attaches great importance to resolving the Austrian question and fully restoring Austria's independence and democracy, and believes that further delays in concluding an Austrian peace treaty are inappropriate. Therefore, as everyone knows, the Soviet government put forward new proposals on the Austrian question on February 8 this year.

    At the initiative of the Soviet government, the Soviet government and the Austrian government preliminarily exchanged views on the above-mentioned proposals put forward by the Soviet government on February 8, between the end of February and March this year. At that time, it was understood that it is now possible to quickly resolve the Austrian question by means of the four countries concluding corresponding agreements with Austria; at that time, it was also agreed that an Austrian government delegation headed by Austrian Prime Minister Raab would come to Moscow on April 11 to continue discussing the issues that had already been raised.

    The Soviet government believes that the exchange of views between Moscow and representatives of the Austrian government will help resolve the Austrian question. The Soviet government takes into account that, in the period since the Berlin Conference, the leaders of the Austrian government have held corresponding meetings and exchanged views with the leaders of Britain, France, and the United States. The Soviet government expresses the hope that, if all the countries concerned have the corresponding desire, it will be possible to reach the necessary agreements in the near future and conclude an Austrian peace treaty.

    The British Ambassador stated that he would immediately convey this statement from the Soviet government to the British government.

    On the same day, Molotov received the US Ambassador Bohlen and the French Chargé d'affaires ad interim Leroy, and issued them the same statement. They stated that they would immediately convey the Soviet statement to their governments.

    莫洛托夫接见英驻苏大使
    就奥地利问题发表声明
    新华社十日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：苏联外交部长莫洛托夫九日接见了英国驻苏联大使威廉·海特尔爵士，就奥地利问题发表了声明。
    声明指出，早在一九五四年年初柏林四国外长会议上，苏联政府就提出了主张尽早解决奥地利问题的建议，主张采取措施防止新的德奥合并，并防止奥地利卷入针对参加过对德战争和解放奥地利战争的任何国家的联盟或军事同盟。但是，在柏林会议上，由于一些不取决于苏联的原因，没有就缔结对奥和约达成协议，奥地利问题没有解决。
    同年八月，苏联政府建议苏联、英国、法国和美国的大使在维也纳举行会议，并在有一位奥地利代表的参加之下，研究有关对奥和约草案的问题和缔结对奥和约的问题，但是，这个会议并没有举行。
    声明接着说：由于维持和巩固欧洲和平的需要，苏联政府十分重视解决奥地利问题和完全恢复奥地利的独立和民主，并且认为在缔结对奥和约方面再事拖延是不对的，因此，如大家所知，苏联政府在今年二月八日提出了关于奥地利问题的新建议。
    在苏联政府的倡议下，今年二月底和三月间，苏联政府和奥地利政府就苏联政府二月八日所提出的上述建议初步地交换了意见。当时了解到：现在有可能通过四国同奥地利缔结相应的协定的办法迅速解决奥地利问题；当时并商定：以奥地利总理拉布先生为首的奥地利政府代表团将在四月十一日来莫斯科，继续商谈已经提出的问题。
    苏联政府认为：在莫斯科和奥地利政府代表交换意见将有助于解决奥地利问题。苏联政府考虑到，在柏林会议以后这个期间，奥地利政府的领袖已经同英国、法国和美国的领袖举行过相应的会议，并交换过意见，苏联政府表示希望，在所有有关国家都具有相应的愿望的情况下，有可能在最近的将来达成必要的协议，并且缔结对奥和约。
    英国大使表示将立即把苏联政府的这一声明转达英国政府。
    莫洛托夫同日接见了美国大使波伦和法国临时代办勒罗阿，向他们发表了同样的声明。他们表示将立即把苏联声明转达他们的政府。
