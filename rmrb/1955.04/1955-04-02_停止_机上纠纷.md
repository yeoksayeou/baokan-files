Stop "In-Flight Disputes"
Kong Sang

Telegrams and long-distance calls are the most important communication tools. In a large country like ours, it is especially necessary to use them to exchange opinions between higher and lower levels and to coordinate work in various regions. In 1954, more than 500 million words of telegrams were sent and more than 50 million long-distance calls were made across the country.

To make a long-distance call, even the most eloquent person has to seize the time and refine their language. To send a telegram, even the most prolific writer has to compress the text to be as short as possible. It can be seen that everyone knows how to cherish every minute of a long-distance call and every word of a telegram, so that more agencies can communicate with each other and save some administrative expenses.

However, some people actually quarrel on telegrams and long-distance calls. These are not others, but the telegraph operators who send and receive telegrams and the telephone operators who switch long-distance calls. In the postal and telecommunications departments, this kind of quarrel even has a special business term called: "in-flight disputes."

In one 92-minute call between the Beijing Long-Distance Exchange and the Wuhan Long-Distance Exchange, as much as 60 minutes of circuit time was wasted because the operators on both sides did not cooperate well, sometimes not responding to calls, and sometimes scolding each other angrily. The Jinzhou Postal and Telecommunications Bureau once called the Dalinghe Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, but could not get through after repeated calls. When they finally got through, the telegraph operator at the Dalinghe Postal and Telecommunications Bureau was in a bad mood and took a whole hour to send the telegram. Mutual abuse and requests for replacement are even more common. Some telegraph operators and telephone operators even ignore how many telegrams are backed up and how many long-distance calls are accumulated, and in a fit of anger, hold down the telegraph key and take off their headphones, ignoring everything.

"In-flight disputes" are caused by the following reasons: First, both parties want to shorten the processing time of telegrams and long-distance calls in their own bureaus and rush ahead of each other; second, they dislike the other party's poor skills and low efficiency, and feel dissatisfied; third, errors occur, responsibilities are unclear, and they pass the buck to each other; fourth, because of these reasons, resentment accumulates and they deliberately make things difficult.

It seems that the cause of "in-flight disputes" is to compete for a "fast" result. However, "in-flight disputes" for any reason can only produce one consequence: delaying time and increasing errors. Manufacturing "in-flight disputes" can never achieve the goal of speed.

Telegrams and long-distance calls play a very important role in the lives of the country and the people, and this role is achieved by the close cooperation of telegraph operators and telephone operators on both sides. Therefore, in every telegram and call, mutual cooperation is required, and no arbitrariness is allowed. Telegraph operators and telephone operators should remember that they are working for the cause of the people.

Telegraph operators and telephone operators stand on glorious posts, and their labor enables agencies separated by thousands of miles to communicate with each other. Therefore, "in-flight disputes" must be stopped in order to better complete the increasingly heavy communication tasks.

    停止“机上纠纷”
    孔桑
    电报和长途电话是最重要的通讯工具。在我们这样的一个大国里，要上下交流意见，各地协商办事，更特别需要利用它。一九五四年，全国各地共发电报五亿多字，共打长途电话五千多万次。
    要打长途电话，那怕是口若悬河的人，也只得抓紧时间，精练语言。要拍电报，那怕是下笔万言的人，也只得把文字压缩得短而又短。可见人人都懂得珍惜长途电话的每一分钟和电报的每一个字，好让更多的机关互通音讯，也可以节省一些行政费用的开支。
    然而，竟也有人在电报上，在长途电话上吵架。这些不是别人，正是那些收发电报的报务员和转接长途电话的话务员。在邮电部门，这种吵架还专有一个业务名词，叫做：“机上纠纷”。
    北京长途台和武汉长途台在一次九十二分钟的通话中，由于双方话务员不好好配合，时而是呼之不应，时而是怒责一通，电路整整浪费了六十分钟。锦州邮电局有一次呼叫大凌河邮电局，千呼万唤不出来，好不容易叫通了，大凌河邮电局的报务员一上来就没有好气，拖了一个钟头才把电报发出去。相互谩骂，要求换人更是普遍现象。甚至有的报务员和话务员，竟不管压了多少电报，积了多少长途电话，一气之下，按住电键，摘下耳机，置之不理了。
   “机上纠纷”不外下列几种原因：一是双方都要缩短电报和长途电话在本局的处理时间，争先恐后；二是嫌对方技术差，效率低，心怀不满；三是发生差错，责任不清，相互推诿；四是因此种种，积怨成恨，故意为难。
    好像产生“机上纠纷”的原因，都是争一个“快”字。但任何原因的“机上纠纷”都只能产生一个后果：延误时间，增加差错。制造“机上纠纷”是永远不可能达到快的目的的。
    电报和长途电话在国家和人民生活中起着很重要的作用，这个作用是依靠双方的报务员和话务员紧密无间的合作才达到的。因此，在每一次发报和通话中，都需要相互间的协作，决不允许有任何意气用事。报务员和话务员都应该记住自己是为了人民的事业而工作的。
    报务员和话务员站在光荣的岗位上，他们的劳动使远隔千山万水的机关互通音讯。因此，必须停止“机上纠纷”，才能更好地完成日益繁重的通讯任务。
