Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, April 12th: The World Federation of Trade Unions, in celebration of "May Day", has issued a letter to the working people of the world. The full text is as follows:

    Working Men and Women!

    At this "May Day" moment, the World Federation of Trade Unions extends to you warm, fraternal greetings and best wishes.

    In recent years, you have waged heroic struggles, and you are still waging them; new battles for a better life, freedom, and peace lie ahead of you.

    Today, you are worried and concerned not only about bread and work, but also about the peace that is in danger.

    The big monopoly capitalists and the governments that serve them, the agents of imperialism and colonialism, are now acting brazenly. They are not only threatening to wage, but are already frantically preparing, an aggressive atomic war against countries where there is no longer exploitation, where the working people have become the masters of their own destiny and their own future.

    The countless material wealth necessary for life, created by people through labor, with their hands and wisdom, and the many achievements created over generations, are in danger of being destroyed. The lives of hundreds of millions of people may be slaughtered. Therefore, the broad masses of working people must now more resolutely and unitedly oppose those who are directly responsible for this threat and their evil policies.

    Working Men and Women! Establish a united and invincible front of labor and progress against the preparation for atomic war, against the remilitarization of West Germany, against the military provocations of American imperialism in Europe and Asia!

    We can and must defend all that is useful and good, and everything that you working people have created, from the threat of war.

    The unified will and common action of the working people of all countries, and our unbreakable solidarity, are stronger than atomic and hydrogen bombs, stronger than all the conspiracies of the war instigators. Let the millions of workers in all cities of the world issue a strong warning on "May Day".

    Strive to make the struggle for improving living and working conditions, for realizing the principles of the Trade Union Rights Charter, for freedom, and for lasting peace among all nations, the slogans of this great festival of international solidarity and friendship!

    Long Live "May Day"!

    Long Live the Solidarity of the Working People of All Countries!

    Long Live Peace!

    为了庆祝“五一”节
    世界工联发表告世界劳动人民书
    新华社十二日讯　据塔斯社维也纳讯：世界工会联合会为了庆祝“五一”节，发表了告全世界劳动人民书，全文如下：男女劳动者们！
    当“五一”节的时刻，世界工会联合会向你们致以热烈的兄弟般的敬礼和最美好的祝贺。
    近几年来，你们进行了英勇的斗争，现在你们仍在进行这种斗争；争取较好的生活、自由和和平的新战斗在你们的前面。
    今天你们不仅在为面包和工作而担心和忧虑，而且在为处于危险中的和平而担心。
    大垄断资本以及替它们服务的政府，帝国主义和殖民主义的代理人现在正在明目张胆地活动。他们不仅仅在威胁要进行而且已经在疯狂地准备侵略性的原子战争，来反对这样一些国家，在这些国家中现在已经没有剥削，劳动人民已经成了自己命运和自己未来的主人。
    人们用劳动、用双手和智慧创造出来的无数为生活所必需的物质财富，世世代代创造出来的许多成果，都有遭到毁灭的危险。亿万人的生命可能遭到屠杀。因此，广大的劳动人民群众现在应当更加坚决、更加团结地来反对对这种威胁直接负责的人和他们的罪恶政策。
    男女劳动者们！建立起劳动和进步的力量的统一和不可战胜的阵线，来反对准备原子战争，反对西德重新军国主义化，反对美国帝国主义在欧洲和亚洲的军事挑衅！
    我们能够而且一定要保卫住一切有用的和美好的东西以及你们劳动者所创造的一切，使它们免受战争的威胁。
    世界各国劳动人民的统一意志和共同行动以及我们牢不可破的团结是比原子弹和氢弹更强有力的，是比战争挑拨者的一切阴谋诡计更强有力的。让世界所有城市的千千万万的劳动者在“五一”节发出有力的警告吧。
    你们要努力使争取改善生活和劳动条件、争取实现工会权利宪章的原则、争取自由和各国人民之间的持久和平的斗争，成为这一伟大的、国际团结友爱的节日的口号！
      “五一”节万岁！
    各国劳动人民的团结一致万岁！
    和平万岁！
