The Indian plane carrying the staff of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference crashed due to the premeditated sabotage by U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek clique secret agents in Hong Kong. The U.S. authorities stubbornly claimed that this incident was groundless and attempted to deny it with all sorts of shameless excuses. But this is useless.

For many years, Hong Kong has been the main base for U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek clique secret agent activities. U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek clique secret agents have been carrying out various conspiracies against the Chinese people here, which is well known. The "National Herald" in Lucknow, India, stated on April 14th: "Hong Kong is a den of spies. It is very important that the Chinese government warned the Hong Kong authorities that sabotage might occur." As early as June 1952, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Allison publicly admitted to the Senate: "The State Department has two sources for collecting information about the Chinese Communists: one is Taiwan, and the other is Hong Kong."

In fact, since before and after the complete liberation of the Chinese mainland in 1949, U.S. imperialism has been actively deploying large-scale espionage activities in Hong Kong to continue to be hostile to the Chinese people.

After the liberation of Nanjing and Shanghai, Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent chief Zheng Jiemin had already agreed with former U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart, to establish the headquarters of the "Sino-American Intelligence Cooperation Organization" in Hong Kong as the command center for U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek clique secret agents in Hong Kong. According to the Associated Press, former U.S. Army Strategic Intelligence Chief Donovan also visited Hong Kong in January 1950 and "discussed a secret agreement" with Chiang Kai-shek's elements to lead the "anti-communist guerrilla warfare" of secret agents and bandits sent to the Chinese mainland. At the same time, the United States established an unusually large consulate in Hong Kong. According to the Hong Kong "New Evening News" on December 1, 1954, this consulate had as many as thirty-six consuls general, consuls, and vice consuls. As everyone knows, Hong Kong is a small place, and there are very few Americans residing in Hong Kong. The United States maintains this huge consulate in Hong Kong, obviously with ulterior motives.

Because the United States, through various agencies and using many different methods, recruits and directs Chiang Kai-shek clique secret agents in Hong Kong to carry out sabotage activities against our country, the secret agents in this "den of spies" in Hong Kong have become increasingly rampant.

According to Hong Kong newspapers, the United States planned and established a huge secret agent organization in Hong Kong called the "Free China Movement." The head of this organization is Cai Wenzhi, the former "Director of the Third Department of the Ministry of National Defense" of Chiang Kai-shek. He has direct contact with Allen Dulles, the head of the U.S. "Central Intelligence Agency." The headquarters of the "Free China Movement" secret agent organization is located in the U.S. base on Okinawa, and a so-called liaison station is set up in Hong Kong. Under the guise of some "commercial companies," Cai sends a large number of Chiang Kai-shek elements to Saipan, Okinawa, and other places to receive special agent training in demolition, espionage, and sniping from the U.S. "Central Intelligence Agency" spy agencies, and then sends these trained secret agents and bandits into the Chinese mainland via Hong Kong and other places. On July 16, 1954, the Hong Kong "Astronomical Observatory" reported that in four years, Cai had sent thousands of people to receive U.S. secret agent training.

In addition, Brian, one of the main persons in charge of the U.S. "Central Intelligence Agency" in the Far East, colluded with Chiang Kai-shek's military intelligence agent Qi Mo to organize a secret agent organization called the "Mainland Guerrilla Force" in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong "Wah Kiu Yat Po" also revealed that the Chiang Kai-shek clique had restored the "Military Intelligence Station" secret agent organization in Hong Kong. According to newspaper reports, the United States and Chiang Kai-shek also engaged in conspiratorial activities in Hong Kong under the names of "Overseas Youth Action Faction," "Hequn Club," "Headquarters of the China Youth Anti-Communist Self-Defense Army," and "Hong Kong Brotherhood." At the same time, the United States and Chiang Kai-shek organized a so-called "Free Labor" organization in Hong Kong, specializing in recruiting secret agents to carry out sabotage activities against our country. The head of this organization, a certain Feng, directly obeyed the orders of Manjia, the director of the Asian office of the "World Federation of Labor" controlled by the United States. Recently, the Associated Press pointed out that some of the people working at Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport belong to this kind of so-called "anti-communist" union, which is actually carrying out sabotage activities against our country.

These U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek clique secret agents, supported and directed by the United States, have been rampant in Hong Kong, endangering the safety of the Chinese people and the social order of Hong Kong. On September 19, 1949, Xu Yuanju, Qi Yulin, and other secret agents from the Second Department of Chiang Kai-shek's "Southwest Military and Political Office" assassinated General Yang Jie, a democratic figure from our country. On September 7 of the same year, U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek clique secret agents sank the British merchant ship "Ze Sheng," which was sailing to Tianjin. On April 2, 1950, seven civil aviation aircraft of China and Central Aviation Companies remaining in Hong Kong were bombed and destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents. Over the years, the British authorities in Hong Kong have also continuously uncovered large quantities of high explosives and firearms hidden by U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek clique secret agents. On January 4, 1953, alone, 136 pounds of TNT explosives, 222 pounds of gelatin explosives, and more than 800 various detonators were found. According to ordnance experts from the Hong Kong police, those TNT explosives are a type used by the U.S. military.

U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek clique secret agents not only act recklessly in Hong Kong but also use Hong Kong as a base to constantly sneak into our mainland and engage in sabotage activities. This has been proven by the many U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek clique spy cases that our public security organs have cracked. In August 1954, Chen Meilin and other Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, who were executed by the Guangdong Provincial People's Court, confessed that they had direct relations with the armed secret agent organization of the "China People's Anti-Communist Self-Defense and National Salvation Team" in Hong Kong. The case of the American spy 雷德蒙(Léidéméng) sentenced to imprisonment by the Shanghai Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in September 1954 proved that these spies carried out activities under the leadership and support of the U.S. spy organization in Hong Kong. The nine Chiang Kai-shek secret agents involved in the case of the American spies 唐奈(Tángnài) and others, sentenced by the Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court of our country in October 1954, also belonged to the above-mentioned secret agent organization of the Hong Kong "Free China Movement."

The above facts show that the crime of U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek clique secret agents' madly murdering the staff of our delegation to the Asian-African Conference is a new development in the sabotage activities carried out by U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek clique secret agents in Hong Kong against the Chinese people for many years. The U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek clique secret agents hiding in Hong Kong are the executors and murderers of this major international political conspiracy. This is something that the U.S. authorities absolutely cannot deny. For several years, the British authorities in Hong Kong should not have allowed U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek clique secret agents to carry out sabotage activities so rampantly in Hong Kong. Now, after our government has promptly issued a warning, it still does not take strict and effective measures to stop the activities of the secret agents, so that the murder plan of U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek clique secret agents can be realized. The serious responsibility of the British authorities in Hong Kong cannot be shaken off in any way. It must thoroughly investigate this case and arrest and bring the murderers to justice.

    美蒋特务在香港的罪恶活动
    崔奇
    我国参加亚非会议代表团工作人员乘坐的印度飞机，由于香港美蒋特务分子的预谋破坏而失事以后，美国当局硬说这件事毫无根据，并且用各种无耻的说法企图加以抵赖。但这是没有用处的。
    多年以来，香港就是美蒋特务活动的大本营。美蒋特务在这里进行着各种各样的反对中国人民的阴谋活动，这是人所共知的。印度勒克瑙的“国民先驱报”在四月十四日就说：“香港是一个间谍窝，中国政府曾警告香港当局可能有破坏事件发生，这是很重要的。”早在一九五二年六月，美国助理国务卿艾利逊也曾向参议院公开承认：“国务院搜集有关中共情报的来源有二：一为台湾，一为香港。”
    事实上，自一九四九年中国大陆全部解放前后，美国帝国主义便以香港为基地，积极着手部署大规模的间谍特务活动来继续和中国人民为敌。
    在南京、上海解放后，蒋贼特务头子郑介民就曾同美国前驻华大使司徒雷登协议在香港建立“中美情报合作所”总部，作为美蒋特务在香港的指挥机关。据美联社透露，美国前陆军战略情报处处长杜诺万并于一九五○年一月到过香港，和蒋贼分子“讨论一项密约”，以领导派遣到中国大陆的特务匪徒的“反共游击战”。同时，美国在香港设立着一个异乎寻常地庞大的领事馆。据一九五四年十二月一日香港“新晚报”称，这个领事馆仅仅总领事、领事和副领事就有三十六人。大家知道，香港地方很小，美国在香港的侨民也很少，美国在香港保有这个庞大的领事馆，显然是有着不可告人的目的。
    由于美国通过各种各样的机关，利用许多不同的方式来搜罗和指挥蒋贼特务分子在香港对我国进行破坏活动，因此，香港这个“间谍窝”的特务们就越来越猖獗了。
    据香港报纸报道，美国在香港策划并建立了一个所谓“自由中国运动”的庞大的特务组织。这个组织的头子是蒋贼前“国防部第三厅厅长”蔡文治。他同美国“中央情报局”首脑艾伦·杜勒斯有直接联系。“自由中国运动”特务组织总部设在美国基地冲绳岛，在香港则设有所谓联络站。蔡匪通过一些“商业公司”的名义把大批蒋贼分子送往塞班岛、冲绳岛等地接受美国“中央情报局”间谍机关的爆破、谍报、狙击等特务训练，然后再把受过美国训练的大批特务匪徒经由香港和其他地方潜入中国大陆。一九五四年七月十六日，香港“天文台报”报道，四年之间被蔡匪送去接受美国特务训练的达几千人。
    除此以外，美国“中央情报局”派遣驻远东方面的主要负责人之一白赖仁同蒋贼军统特务漆墨勾结起来在香港组织了所谓“大陆游击队”的特务机构。香港“华侨日报”也曾透露，蒋贼集团在香港恢复了“军统站”的特务机构。根据报纸消息，美蒋还在香港以“海外青年行动派”、“合群俱乐部”、“中国青年反共自卫军总部”、“香港兄弟会”等等名义，从事阴谋活动。同时，美国和蒋贼在香港组织了一个所谓“自由劳工”组织，专门搜罗特务对我国进行破坏活动，这个组织的头子冯某直接听命于受美国操纵的“世界劳工联合会”亚洲办事处主任满嘉。最近合众社就指出，在香港启德机场工作的人，有一部分就属于这种所谓“反共”而实际上则是对我国进行破坏活动的“工会”。
    这些在美国支持和指挥下的美蒋特务分子一直在香港横行不法，危害中国人民的安全和香港的社会治安。一九四九年九月十九日，蒋贼“西南长官公署”第二署特务分子徐远举、齐玉麟等，刺杀了我国民主人士杨杰将军。同年九月七日，美蒋特务分子炸沉了开往天津的英国商船“泽生号”。一九五○年四月二日，我中国、中央两航空公司留在香港的七架民航飞机，又被蒋贼特务用炸弹炸毁。几年以来，香港英国当局也不断破获美蒋特务分子所藏匿的大批烈性炸药和枪枝。仅在一九五三年一月四日发现的，就有TNT炸药一百三十六磅、胶质炸药二百二十二磅和各式信管八百多条。据香港警察机关军械专家说：那些TNT的烈性炸药是美国军队所使用的一种。
    美蒋特务分子不仅在香港胡作非为，而且以香港为基地，不断地潜入我国大陆，从事破坏活动。这一点从我国公安机关所破获的许多美蒋间谍特务案件中，已经得到证明。一九五四年八月，经我广东省人民法院处决的蒋贼特务陈美麟等曾供认，他们和香港“中国人民反共自卫救国队”的武装特务组织有直接关系。一九五四年九月，被中国人民解放军上海市军事管制委员会军法处宣判徒刑的雷德蒙美国间谍案证明，这些间谍曾在美国在香港的间谍组织的领导和支持之下进行活动。一九五四年十月经我国最高人民法院军事审判庭判决的美国间谍唐奈等案件中所牵涉的九名蒋贼特务，也都是属于上述香港“自由中国运动”的特务组织的。
    以上事实说明，美蒋特务分子疯狂谋杀我国出席亚非会议代表团工作人员的罪行，是多年以来美蒋特务在香港进行反对中国人民的破坏活动的新发展。藏在香港的美蒋特务，是这个国际重大政治阴谋的执行者和杀人犯。这是美国当局所绝对抵赖不了的。几年以来，香港英国当局早就不应该容许美蒋特务在香港这样猖狂地进行破坏活动。现在，在我国政府已经及时提出警告之后，它仍然不采取严格有效的措施来制止特务们的活动，以致美蒋特务的谋杀计划得以实现。香港英国当局的严重责任是无论如何也不能摆脱的。它必须对这个案子彻底查究，必须将杀人犯逮捕法办。
