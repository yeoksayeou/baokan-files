Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will cultivate a large number of high-quality forage grasses this year. The region plans to promote more than 47,000 mu of alfalfa, more than double the amount last year; and advocate the planting of native high-quality forage grasses such as *Ning tiao*, barnyard grass, and naked oats.

	The Hetao Administrative Region is the key area for alfalfa cultivation in the region. It is planned to promote alfalfa throughout the region by 1957, at which time the problem of insufficient livestock feed will be completely solved. The Ikezhao League has relatively poor natural pastures, so artificial cultivation of forage grasses and improvement of grasslands are a major task for the league. This year, the Ikezhao League will not only promote alfalfa, but also plans to cultivate more than 85,000 mu of various local high-quality forage grasses. Pingdiquan Administrative Region, Ulanqab League, Chahar League, Hulunbuir League and other places will all focus on trial planting of some high-quality forage grasses this year.

	Preparations for forage grass cultivation began early this year. In addition to purchasing some grass seeds locally, nearly 20,000 catties of alfalfa seeds were purchased from Shaanxi Province. The alfalfa seeds concentrated in the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry have been distributed to various places in early March to facilitate timely sowing by the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen.

    内蒙古大量栽培优良牧草
    今年，内蒙古自治区将大量栽培各种优良牧草。全区计划推广紫花苜蓿四万七千多亩，比去年增加了一倍以上；并提倡种植宁条、稗子、青莜麦等本地优良牧草。
    河套行政区是全区栽培紫花苜蓿的重点，计划到一九五七年在全区推广，到那时即可完全解决牲畜饲草不足的问题。伊克昭盟因天然牧场较差，人工栽培牧草，改良草原，是该盟的一项主要工作。伊克昭盟今年不仅要推广苜蓿草，同时计划栽培本地各种优良牧草八万五千多亩。平地泉行政区、乌兰察布盟、察哈尔盟、呼伦贝尔盟等地，今年都重点试种一些优良牧草。
    今年栽培牧草准备工作动手早。除在本地收购一部分草籽外，还从陕西省购买了近两万斤苜蓿籽。集中在农牧部的苜蓿籽，于三月上旬就已经分发各地，以便广大农、牧民适时播种。
