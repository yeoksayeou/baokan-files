An agricultural machine station in western Guangdong Province has been established in early April. The station is located in Xiaqiao Town, Xuwen County, on the Leizhou Peninsula. This agricultural machine station has eleven tractor teams, located in Haikang and Xuwen counties respectively. The entire station has fifty-two tractors of various types, including Stalin-80 and Dett-54 models, as well as various other agricultural machines. The total tractor traction power of the entire station is approximately equivalent to the working capacity of three thousand strong oxen.

    During the preparatory period, this agricultural machine station signed cultivation contracts with five agricultural producers' cooperatives in Xuwen County and some agricultural producers' cooperatives in the 11th District of Haikang County, and cultivated more than 2,000 mu of land for them. The more than 200 mu of land cultivated for the Second Agricultural Producers' Cooperative of Wenbu Township, Xuwen County, were originally barren slopes covered with tall trees and waist-deep weeds. After the tractors uprooted the trees and leveled the land, the original barren slopes are now planted with sugarcane and kenaf, becoming a beautiful pastoral scene.

    Most of the land on the Leizhou Peninsula is still undeveloped. Barren slopes stretch endlessly across the entire peninsula. The establishment of the Western Guangdong Agricultural Machine Station will have a huge impact on the agricultural development of the peninsula, and the vast wasteland will gradually be transformed into fertile fields.

    雷州半岛上建立农业机器站
    广东省粤西农业机器站已在四月初成立，站址设在雷州半岛上的徐闻县下桥镇。这个农业机器站设有十一个拖拉机队，分设海康、徐闻两县，全站拥有斯大林八十号和德特五十四号等各式拖拉机五十二台，还有其他农业机器多种。全站拖拉机牵引力的总和约等于三千头健壮的耕牛的耕作能力。
    这个农业机器站在筹备期间已和徐闻县五个农业生产合作社以及海康县第十一区部分农业生产合作社订了代耕合同，并为他们耕了二千多亩土地。代徐闻县文部乡第二农业生产合作社耕的二百多亩地原来就是长满大树和齐腰深野草的荒坡。经拖拉机把树连根拔掉，把地犁平后，原来的荒坡现已种满甘蔗和番麻，成为美丽的田园。
    雷州半岛绝大部分土地尚未开发。整个半岛荒坡连绵不绝。粤西农业机器站的成立对半岛的农业发展将发生巨大的影响，广阔的荒地将逐步变为万顷良田。
