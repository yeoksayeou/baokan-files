The national state-owned coal mines under the Coal Mine Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry overfulfilled their production target for the first quarter, producing more than 100,000 tons of raw coal for the country. Compared with the same period last year, production increased by more than 16 percent. This portion of coal produced in excess of last year is enough to supply the country's state-owned power plants for more than four months.

In February and March, the coal mine administrations in various regions either held production meetings or organized work teams to provide specific assistance to certain units. Large units with higher coal production, such as Fushun, Fuxin, Datong, and Huainan Mining Bureaus, also adopted many effective measures in February and March, which rapidly improved the production situation. The Fushun Mining Bureau first examined the reasons for the unsatisfactory completion of the January task, formulated measures and plans, improved electromechanical management, and greatly reduced accidents. The Fuxin Mining Bureau convened a congress of trade union member representatives and advanced producers, passed a resolution on "deepening and carrying out a sustained labor competition," and exchanged experiences such as promoting the "Peace No. 1 Pit One Meter Layer," organizing production meetings, and inter-trade competitions. The Datong Mining Bureau focused on adhering to regular cyclical operations and closely monitored scheduling work, with the deputy mine director on duty personally directing and resolving problems in a timely manner. At the same time, they improved the handover system, with workers going down the well in batches according to their trades, which neither affected the coal output of the shift nor delayed the production of the current shift. The Huainan Mining Bureau further enhanced the enthusiasm of workers through the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons and the discussion of national plans. This played a significant role in ensuring the completion of the national production task.

    全国国营煤矿第一季增产原煤十万多吨
    本报讯　燃料工业部煤矿管理总局所属全国国营煤矿第一季产量任务超额完成，为国家多生产了十万多吨原煤。同去年同期比较，产量增长了百分之十六以上。仅这部分比去年多生产的煤，就足够全国国营电厂四个多月的消耗。
    各地区煤矿管理局在二、三月份或召开了生产会议，或组织了工作组对某些单位进行了具体帮助；各个产煤较多的大单位如抚顺、阜新、大同、淮南等局二、三月份也都采取了不少有效措施，使生产情况迅速好转。抚顺矿务局首先检查一月份任务完成不够好的原因，制定出措施计划，改进了机电管理工作，大大减少了事故；阜新矿务局召开了工会会员代表及先进生产者大会，通过了“深入开展持久的劳动竞赛”的决议，并交流了推广平安一坑一公尺层、组织生产会议和同工种竞赛等经验；大同矿务局重点坚持正规循环作业，并抓紧了调度工作，由值班副矿长亲自指挥，发现问题及时解决，同时改进了交接班办法，分工种分批下井，既不影响上班出煤，也不耽误本班生产；淮南矿务局通过反对使用原子武器签名运动和讨论国家计划，进一步提高了职工生产热情。这对保证完成全国生产任务都起了很大作用。
