    Immediately Stop the Phenomenon of Destroying Mulberry Fields
    Zhang Weiqi
    More than two months ago, the People's Daily criticized the phenomenon of arbitrarily cutting down mulberry trees in some areas of the South. According to my understanding, this phenomenon has not completely stopped even now. For example, more than 10,000 mu of mulberry trees have been cut down in Zhejiang Province alone. In Chongde County alone, more than 3,000 mu of mulberry gardens were destroyed in order to convert dry land into paddy fields. Individual state-owned farms and agricultural producers' cooperatives also continuously cut down mulberry trees.
    It is not difficult to see how serious the loss caused to the country and farmers by cutting down mulberry trees is by calculating the following account.
    According to general estimates, the silkworms raised on one mu of mulberry trees can produce about 50 jin of fresh cocoons each year. Destroying 10,000 mu of mulberry trees is equivalent to reducing 500,000 jin of fresh cocoons, or 60,000 jin of silk, or more than 15,000 bolts of silk annually. If more than 15,000 bolts of silk are exported, it can be exchanged for more than 10,000 tons of fertilizer, or more than 7,000 tons of steel. For farmers, destroying 10,000 mu of mulberry trees is equivalent to reducing their income by more than 375,000 yuan each year. Considering the country's construction and the interests of farmers, this phenomenon of destroying mulberry trees must be stopped immediately.
    The situation in Zhejiang and other places shows that the state's policy of vigorously developing silk production has not been effectively implemented in the actual work of some areas. Many cadres lack an overall view of arranging various productions and do not understand the significant role of increasing silk production in developing industry and improving farmers' lives. Therefore, when deploying the production of grain and oil crops, they intentionally or unintentionally negate or belittle the significance of silk production, which increases the concerns of some farmers about growing mulberry trees and raising silkworms. For example, in the grain "Three Fixes" work in some places, cadres do not proceed from reality, but calculate the grain output of each mu of land planted with three-tenths of mulberry trees as if the land were not planted with mulberry trees, so that farmers are unwilling to plant mulberry trees and only want to grow more crops.
    Many agricultural producers' cooperatives have made mistakes in handling the issue of mulberry trees joining the cooperative, which has also fueled the phenomenon of farmers cutting down mulberry trees. Some agricultural cooperatives treat the mulberry fields that joined the cooperative as wasteland; some agricultural cooperatives stipulate that the price of mulberry leaves is only half of the market price, and stipulate that the mulberry trees on the members' private plots must be unconditionally owned by the cooperative. These wrong practices have damaged the unity of middle and poor peasants and have also damaged the farmers' enthusiasm for increasing silk production. A farmer in Wuxing County saw the situation of cutting down mulberry trees and said painfully: "The district and township cadres don't know that raising mulberry trees is like holding a child. If this continues, in two or three years, the mulberry roots will have to be turned over (dug up)!" This is the concerned warning issued by farmers against the act of destroying mulberry trees!
    Now, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee are urging various places in Zhejiang to correct the phenomenon of cutting down mulberry trees, which is very necessary. Other places should also learn from this lesson, establish an overall view of leading agricultural production, and make overall arrangements for the production of grain, oil, and various economic crops according to local conditions. In areas with the conditions for raising silkworms, it is completely wrong to artificially reduce the production of mulberry and silkworm in order to increase other agricultural products.

    立即制止破坏桑田的现象
    张维奇
    两个多月以前，人民日报曾经批评了南方某些地区任意砍伐桑树的现象。据我了解，这种现象到现在还没有完全停止。例如，浙江全省已有一万多亩桑树被砍掉了。仅崇德一县，为了改旱田为水田，就毁掉三千多亩桑园。个别国营农场和农业生产合作社也连续砍伐桑树。
    算一算下面这笔账，就不难看出砍伐桑树给国家和农民造成了多么严重的损失。
    根据一般人的估计，一亩桑树养的蚕，每年大约可产五十斤鲜茧，毁掉一万亩桑树，等于每年减少五十万斤鲜茧，或六万斤蚕丝，或一万五千多匹绸缎。如果出口一万五千多匹绸缎，可以换回一万多吨肥田粉，或七千多吨钢材。对于农民来说，毁掉一万亩桑树，就等于每年减少三十七万五千多元的收入。为国家建设着想，为农民利益着想，都必须立即制止这种破坏桑树的现象。
    浙江等地发生的这种情况，说明国家大力发展蚕丝生产的方针，还没有在某些地区的实际工作中切实贯彻下去。许多干部缺乏全面安排各种生产的观点，不了解增产蚕丝对发展工业和改善农民生活的重大作用，因此，在布置粮食、油料作物的生产时，就有意无意地否定或贬低了蚕丝生产的意义，增加了部分农民对种桑养蚕的顾虑。例如，个别地方的干部在粮食“三定”工作中，不从实际出发，把每亩种有三分桑树的田，按没有种桑的田那样计算粮食产量，以致农民不愿种桑，只想多种庄稼。
    不少农业生产合作社处理入社的桑树问题有错误，也助长了农民砍伐桑树的现象。有的农业社把入社的桑田作白地论；有的农业社规定的桑叶作价仅抵市价的二分之一，并规定社员自留地上的桑树要无条件地归社所有。这些错误的做法，损害了中、贫农的团结，也损害了农民增产蚕桑的积极性。吴兴县一个农民看到砍伐桑树的情形，痛心地说：“区、乡干部不晓得养桑树像抱孩子一样，照这样下去，二、三年以后，桑根都要翻身（挖掉）了！”这就是农民对破坏桑树的行为发出的关心的警告！
    现在，中共浙江省委和浙江省人民委员会正在督促浙江各地，纠正砍伐桑树的现象，这是很必要的。其他各地也应该接受这种教训，树立领导农业生产的全局观点，因地制宜地通盘安排粮食、油料和各种经济作物的生产。在具备养蚕条件的地区，为了增产其他农产品而人为地缩减桑蚕生产，是完全错误的。
