Lüda Municipality farmers have victoriously completed their plan to plant 500,000 new fruit trees this year, and farmers in individual areas are continuing to plant. This number is equivalent to 63 percent of the original number of fruit trees before liberation. The enthusiasm of farmers in Jin County for planting fruit trees this year is particularly high. According to incomplete statistics, more than 250,000 fruit trees have been planted so far, exceeding the state plan by 15.3 percent.

This year, with the assistance and guidance of agricultural technology departments, the planting techniques of Lüda Municipality farmers have also been significantly improved. The tree pits, plant spacing, etc., are generally up to standard, which creates conditions for the mechanization of orchard production in the future, extending the life of fruit trees, and creating high yields. In particular, the vast majority of this year's newly planted fruit trees are planted on hillsides, implementing the principle of "fruit trees on the mountains, not competing with grain and cotton for land."

The varieties of fruit trees planted by Lüda Municipality farmers this year have also increased compared to the past, including nearly 20 kinds of apples, peaches, pears, grapes, etc. In two or three years, various fruit trees will gradually bear fruit. At that time, large stretches of continuous hills and undulating mounds will be transformed into beautiful and lush fruit tree forests.

    旅大农民新植果树五十万棵
      旅大市农村今年新植果树五十万棵的计划已胜利完成，个别地区的农民还在继续栽植。这个数目，相当于解放前原有果树的百分之六十三。金县农民今年栽植果树的热情特别高涨。据不完全统计，到目前为止已栽植的果树有二十五万余棵，超过国家计划百分之十五点三。
    今年旅大市农民在农业技术部门的协助和指导下，栽植技术也有了显著的改进，树窝、株距等一般的都合乎规格，这给今后的果园生产的机械化、延长果树寿命和创造高额的产量创造了条件。特别是今年的新植果树绝大部分都栽在山坡地上，贯彻了“果树上山，不和粮棉争地”的原则。
    今年旅大市农民栽植的果树品种也比过去增加了，其中有苹果、桃子、梨、葡萄等近二十种。两三年以后，各种果树等都将陆续结果。那时，又将有大片连绵的山岗和起伏的丘陵变成美丽、繁茂的果树林。
