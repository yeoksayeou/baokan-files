    A Fighting Fortress That Does Not Bow to Difficulties
    ——A Record of the Drought Resistance Struggle of the Longshou Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Maoming County Leading the Masses
    Xiao Lan
    The Longshou Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Maoming County, Guangdong Province, is a young branch. It was only established in October 1954. In the past six months, especially since Longshou Township suffered a freezing disaster in mid-January of this year, this young branch has fully played the role of a fighting fortress.
    Longshou Township is high-lying, and the fields are barren. Last year, it suffered from successive disasters such as floods, droughts, winds, and insects, resulting in a large reduction in production. At the beginning of this year, it suffered another freezing disaster. More than 2,000 mu of winter crops, on which the township's farmers relied to survive the famine, were completely lost. The disaster was very serious, and then the entire township was threatened by drought.
    Since September 1954, Longshou Township has not had any rain. The only small stream in the township has also dried up. Early-maturing crops cannot be replanted due to lack of water. Many farmers are pessimistic and disappointed. They said: Now everything is over. There is no other way but government relief. Many cadres are at a loss in the face of such serious difficulties. Individual party members also developed this sentiment. After the freezing disaster, the party branch held an emergency meeting. Party member Li Cuihua said: "The masses are asking the government for relief. I think this is the only way. The drought is so serious that no early-maturing crops can be planted!" In response to this situation, the branch meeting focused on discussing "what are the real interests of the masses." Ke Shutai, the director of the agricultural production cooperative and a communist party member, said: "Relief is a method. The government has already allocated relief funds. However, can the masses survive the famine by relying solely on relief funds?" Ke Zhenyu, the branch secretary, more clearly pointed out: "For the sake of the interests of the masses, we must lead the masses to do a good job in production and launch a production-based disaster relief movement." Then the party members attending the meeting all proposed: Communist party members must not bow to difficulties, must always care about the lives of the peasant masses, and when the masses have disasters, we must lead the masses to fight against the disasters. The meeting also reviewed the work of the branch in the three months since its establishment, and believed that the party branch's mass viewpoint was not strong enough, and that it did not regard leading production as its central work. Finally, the branch specifically deployed production and disaster relief work, and pointed out that eliminating the pessimistic and disappointed emotions of the masses and doing a good job in production and disaster relief work are the most urgent tasks at present.
    The branch meeting ended, and it was almost dark. Ke Zhenyu walked back and forth in Shamao Ridge several times, looking at the crops that had been frozen to death, and felt a pang of pain in his heart. He thought: "The masses are waiting for us to come up with a solution!" Without going home for dinner, he went to discuss with the old farmer Ke Chunrui.
    "Uncle Chunrui, so many crops have been frozen to death or injured. Is there any way to remedy it?"
      "What can be done to remedy it? Just wait to starve to death!"
    Ke Zhenyu patiently explained to him: "The Communist Party will not let the peasants starve to death. We must do everything possible to lead the peasants to carry out production for self-salvation..." He spent a lot of effort to explain the principles of production for self-salvation to Ke Chunrui, and then asked:
    "According to your experience, what early-maturing crops can be planted now besides millet and slope rice?"
    Ke Chunrui listened to his reasonable explanation and became more open-minded. He said: Rape and soybeans can still be planted now. But, he added: "Where can we find water to plant them? The soil is as hard as a stone."
    Ke Zhenyu told him that he must find a water source no matter what, and plant the early-maturing crops.
    Then, Ke Zhenyu thought, it is difficult to get started with everything, and there should be a driving force. Back home, he hurriedly ate something, and then rushed to Shu Tou Po village to discuss with the cadres of the agricultural production cooperative and draw up a plan for digging wells and planting early-maturing crops. When he left, it was already past eleven o'clock in the evening. He repeatedly instructed Ke Shutai, the director of the cooperative, and told him that he must find a way to find a water source.
    When Ke Zhenyu returned to Shuiping Ridge Village, he was already very tired. However, he thought that he had to cultivate a few core mutual aid teams to drive the work. So he went to the grain processing plant of the mutual aid team led by Ke Jingsheng. At this time, more than a dozen mutual aid team members were still processing grain. Ke Zhenyu walked in, joined the work, and explained the significance of production for self-salvation to them, and helped them draw up an action plan. The team members became happier as they talked, and said to Ke Zhenyu: Don't worry, we must set an example. It was not until after one o'clock the next morning that Ke Zhenyu returned home with peace of mind.
    After the communist party members went deep into mobilizing the people, the agricultural production cooperative and several core mutual aid teams in the township began to take action.
    Ke Shutai remembered the resolution of the branch meeting yesterday, remembered the branch secretary's repeated instructions, and also remembered his guarantee: "No matter what happens, I will guarantee to find a water source." He felt warm in his heart. At this time, chills were tormenting him. However, when he thought that the party and the masses were hoping that the agricultural production cooperative would take the lead in action, he cheered up and went everywhere to find water sources. He walked to Dapo Mountain, grabbed a handful of soil, and felt it was very loose and moist. "It hasn't rained for half a year, why is the soil here so loose and moist?" After thinking about it, he hurried back to consult with Ke Jiongzhi, an old farmer in his seventies. Ke Jiongzhi told him: There is a "dragon vein" there, and there may be water; however, no one has ever dared to dig there. This discovery made Ke Shutai particularly excited. He hurriedly consulted with Ke Zhenyu and decided to dig the first well there.
    More than 30 laborers from the agricultural production cooperative were dispatched to dig wells. Ke Shutai endured his illness and worked with everyone. However, no spring water was seen after digging to a depth of thirteen feet, and the cooperative members began to lose heart. Ke Shutai encouraged them and said: "This place is high, and there must be water if you dig deeper!" After saying that, he took the lead in climbing down to dig. Everyone continued to dig two feet deep, but there was still no spring water, so they became even more discouraged. Some people said: "It's not worth the effort, let's not dig." Some people mentioned an old saying that has been circulating in this area: "Maoming County, many mountains, high terrain, digging for spring water, definitely none." They all said that the old saying passed down from generation to generation by ancestors cannot be wrong! However, difficulties cannot frighten communist party members. Ke Shutai thought: "If this well is not dug, the whole township will not be able to move!" "We must persevere!" He immediately held a "battlefield meeting" with the cooperative committee Ke Tairui, production captain Ke Dixing, and Ke Yasi to continue to mobilize, and once again took the lead in going down to dig with several activists. Many cooperative members thought: Ke Shutai is digging a well despite his illness, isn't it for everyone's sake? So they also climbed down to continue digging. When digging to a depth of seventeen feet, someone suddenly shouted: There is water! At this time, the cooperative members were as happy as if they had found a treasure, and they all gathered around to watch. Ke Shutai said with shining eyes: "The first well has finally been successfully dug. The old saying should also be put away!" A cooperative member said to Ke Shutai: "Fortunately, there are party members, otherwise the water that comes to the mouth would be lost."
    On the same day, several core mutual aid teams also successively dug wells.
    The first shot was fired. The branch immediately convened a meeting to summarize the preliminary achievements and experiences, and believed that there were water sources in many places, as long as you aim accurately and dig deeply. Then, the branch convened a meeting of representatives of mutual aid and cooperation in the township, promoted these experiences, explained to everyone that the idea of ​​simply relying on government relief was wrong, and called on everyone to continue to organize to resist drought and rush to plant. Water was indeed found, and the facts were in front of them, and any conservative ideas could not stand. "This time we have a way!" Everyone unanimously supported the branch's decision on drought resistance and rush planting. The meeting also approved the township's production disaster relief plan. The mutual aid teams took the lead in the competition at the meeting. The movement to dig wells and rush to plant early-maturing crops was launched.
    All 62 mutual aid teams in the township organized labor to dig wells, carry water, and replant and rush to plant. Dagangjiao Village originally dug three wells, but there was no water. After inspection, they continued to dig. Now all three wells have water. The well dug by the mutual aid team led by Ke Jiongying in Shuikoupo Village was repeatedly dug three times. It was more than ten feet deep and still no water was seen. The fourth time, people were hoisted to the bottom of the well with a large rope, and they persisted in digging for three consecutive days. Finally, they used fir wood to penetrate the spring eye. The spring eye, as big as a basin mouth, immediately sprayed water, which could irrigate seven mu of crops a day.
    Once the wells were dug, the cooperative members and team members worked day and night to draw water and carry water for rush planting.
    At this time, Ke Xiuxuan, a middle peasant who had withdrawn from the mutual aid team, watched his seven mu of sweet potatoes that had been frozen to death and secretly shed tears. He thought: Single fists and palms can't change the planting! I knew this, I wouldn't have withdrawn from the team. If I ask to join the mutual aid team again, it's embarrassing.
    The branch quickly learned about Ke Xiuxuan's concerns. Branch Secretary Ke Zhenyu thought: This is the depression of more than 500 individual farmers in the township! The party teaches us that we cannot ignore individual farmers. Therefore, he first organized an inspection of the township's drought resistance and rush planting work. The results of the inspection showed that none of the seven villages without mutual aid teams had taken action. At the same time, the branch also learned in time that in the face of this severe disaster, many individual farmers had begun to realize that the road of mutual aid and cooperation pointed out by the party was the only way out, and asked to join the mutual aid teams. The branch immediately put forward the slogan "Support backward villages, implement the policy of voluntary mutual benefit, and help individual farmers organize", and immediately sent 11 stronger cadres to these villages to help carry out this work.
    In Dagangjiao Village, 25 farmers were unwilling to join the mutual aid team in the past, saying that joining the team would be restricted in everything. After the freezing disaster, most of the village's approximately 30 mu of sweet potatoes were frozen to death. The farmers looked at the fields, drooping their heads and disheartened, with no way to do anything. It was really "difficult to do anything with a single gun and horse"! At this difficult time, the party sent cadres to help them establish two mutual aid teams (21 households participated). After the mutual aid teams were established, they quickly dug three wells and planted 20 mu of early-maturing crops. A few days later, Longshou Township added 32 temporary mutual aid teams, and many existing mutual aid teams also expanded. Approximately 80 percent of the farmers in the township participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Before this, 600-700 people and more than 100 waterwheels were deployed every day to dig wells and plant crops; after this, more than 1,000 people and 350 waterwheels were deployed every day.
    As a result of relying on mutual aid and cooperative organizations to resist drought and rush planting, Longshou Township has now planted more than 3,100 mu of various early-maturing crops, which is more than twice as much as the most planted years in the past. Many early-planted crops have been fertilized and weeded, and are growing vigorously, and early-planted vegetables have been harvested. The branch also mobilized farmers to help each other and carry out various sideline productions, solving the living difficulties of 300 farmers. At present, the farmers in the township are planning spring production with full confidence to welcome the spring plowing. The township has prepared more than 180,000 dan of fertilizer needed for spring plowing.
    The Maoming County Committee of the Communist Party of China has commended the Longshou Township Branch and the party members and cadres who have made significant achievements in leading drought resistance, and made a decision to launch the Longshou Township movement. The South China Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China requires rural workers throughout the region to pay attention to learning from the experience of the Longshou Township branch.

    一个不向困难低头的战斗堡垒
    ——记中共茂名县龙首乡支部领导群众的抗旱斗争
    晓蓝
    中共广东省茂名县龙首乡支部是一个年轻的支部。一九五四年十月这个支部才建立起来。半年来，特别是今年一月中旬龙首乡遭受冻灾以后，这个年轻的支部已经充分地发挥了战斗堡垒的作用。
    龙首乡地势高亢，田土瘦瘠，去年接连遭受水、旱、风、虫等灾害，减产很多。今年年初又受到冻灾，全乡农民赖以度荒的二千多亩冬种作物，全部遭受损失，灾情非常严重，接着，全乡又受到旱灾的威胁。
    一九五四年九月以后，龙首乡一直没有下过雨。全乡仅有的一条小溪也干涸了。早熟作物因为缺水无法补种。许多农民都悲观失望。他们说：现在什么都完了，除了政府救济就没有别的办法了。许多干部面对着这样严重的困难，束手无策。个别党员也产生了这种情绪。冻灾过后，党支部召开了紧急会议。党员李翠华说：“群众要求政府救济。我看也只有这个办法了。旱情这样严重，什么早熟作物都不能种啦！”针对这种情况，支部会议着重讨论了“群众的真正利益是什么”的问题。农业生产合作社主任、共产党员柯树泰说：“救济是一个办法，目前政府已经把救济款拨下来了。但是，单靠救济款，群众能度过灾荒吗？”支部书记柯振玉更加明确地提出：“为了群众的利益，我们必须领导群众搞好生产，开展生产度荒运动。”于是到会的党员都提出：共产党员不能向困难低头，要时刻关心农民群众的生活，群众有灾难，我们就要领导群众向灾难作斗争。会议还检查了支部成立三个多月来的工作情况，认为党支部的群众观点是不够强的，没有把领导生产当做自己的中心工作；最后，支部具体地部署了生产救灾工作，并指出，消除群众的悲观失望情绪，搞好生产救灾工作，是当前最迫切的任务。
    支部开完紧急会议，已经快天黑了。柯振玉在沙帽垌来回走了好几趟，看着那些已被冻死的作物，心里一阵隐痛。他想：“群众等待着我们出办法啊！”来不及回家吃晚饭，他就去找老农柯春瑞商量。
    “春瑞叔，冻死冻伤这样多作物，有办法可以补救吗？”
      “有什么办法补救？等着饿死就是了！”
    柯振玉耐心地向他解释：“共产党不会让农民饿死的。要想尽一切办法领导农民进行生产自救……。”他花了好大功夫，向柯春瑞讲清楚生产自救的道理，然后问：
    “照你的经验，现在除了种些粟仔、坡禾之外，还可以种些什么早熟作物？”
    柯春瑞听他讲得有理，思想开朗了些，便说：现在还可以种油菜、黄豆等。可是，又说：“哪里有水来种？土地像石块那样硬。”
    柯振玉告诉他，无论如何都要找到水源，要把早熟作物种下去。
    接着，柯振玉又想，万事起头难，应该有一个带动的力量才行。回到家里，他匆匆忙忙吃了点东西，便赶紧跑到水头坡村和农业生产合作社干部商量，订出挖井和种早熟作物的计划。临走时，已是晚上十一点多钟了。他又再三嘱咐社主任柯树泰，叫他一定要想办法找出水源来。
    当柯振玉回到水平垌村时，已经很疲倦了。但是，他想，还得培养几个核心互助组来带动才行。于是他又走到柯景胜领导的互助组的粮食加工场去。这时候，十多个互助组员还在进行粮食加工。柯振玉走进去，一边参加干活，一边对他们解释生产自救的意义，并且帮助他们订出行动计划。组员们越谈越高兴，对柯振玉说：放心吧，我们一定要做个样。直到次晨一点多钟，柯振玉才放心地回到家里。
    经过共产党员深入发动后，乡里的农业生产合作社和几个核心互助组开始行动了。
    柯树泰想起昨天支部会议的决议，想起支部书记再三的叮嘱，也想起了自己的保证：“不管天翻地覆，保证找出水源来。”他心里热呼呼的。这时候，寒热病正在折磨着他。但是，他一想到党和群众正希望农业生产合作社带头行动的时候，他振作起来，到处奔走去找水源。他走到大坡山，抓起一把土，感到很松润。“半年没下雨，为什么这里的土这样松润？”想了一想，他赶紧回去找七十多岁的老农柯炯芝商量。柯炯芝告诉他：那里是一条
  “龙脉”，很可能有水；但是，向来都没有人敢挖。这个发现，使柯树泰格外兴奋，他急忙找柯振玉商量，并决定就在那里挖第一口水井。
    农业生产合作社的三十多个劳动力出动挖井了。柯树泰熬着病和大家一起干活。但是挖到一丈三尺深还不见泉水，社员们开始泄气了。柯树泰鼓励他们说：“这里地势高，再挖下去一定有水！”说完自己又首先爬下去挖起来。大家继续挖了两尺深，还没有泉水，就更加泄气，有人说：“吃力不讨好，不挖了。”有人提起了这一带流传的一句古话：“茂名县，山岭多，地势高，挖泉水，一定无。”都说，祖先世代传下来的古话哪有不对的道理！但是，困难吓不倒共产党员。柯树泰想：“这口井不挖成，全乡就动不起来！”“一定要坚持下去！”他马上找社委柯泰瑞、生产队长柯帝兴、柯亚四几个人举行“战地会议”，继续进行鼓动，并且和几个积极分子再次带头下去挖。许多社员想到：柯树泰熬着病来挖井，还不是为了大伙？于是也爬下去继续挖。挖到一丈七尺深时，突然有人喊：有水啦！这时，社员们像找到宝贝一样，都万分高兴地围过来看。柯树泰眼睛闪着光说：“第一口井终于挖成功了。古话也要收起来啦！”一个社员对柯树泰说：“好在有党员，不然到口的水也丢了。”
    同一天，几个核心互助组也相继挖成了水井。
    第一炮打响了。支部马上召开会议，总结了初步的成绩和经验，认为很多地方都有水源，只要瞄得准，挖得深。接着，支部召开全乡互助合作代表会议，推广这些经验，向大家说明单纯依赖政府救济的想法不对，号召大家继续组织起来抗旱抢种。水确是找到了，事实摆在面前，任何保守思想也站不住脚了。“这回有办法了！”大家一致拥护支部关于抗旱抢种的决定。会议并通过了全乡生产度荒的计划。互助组在会上挑起了竞赛。挖井抢种早熟作物的运动便掀起来了。
    全乡六十二个互助组都纷纷组织了劳动力来挖井、担水，进行补种、抢种。大岭脚村原来挖了三口井，没有水，经过检查后又继续挖，现在三口井都挖出水来了。水口坡村柯炯英领导的互助组挖的那口井，反复挖了三次，挖到一丈多深仍不见水，第四次用大绳把人吊下井底，一连坚持挖了三天，最后用杉木打穿泉眼，盆口大的泉眼，立即喷出水来，一天能灌溉七亩作物。
    井打成了，社员、组员们夜以继日地车水、担水进行抢种。
    就在这个时候，曾经退出互助组的中农柯秀轩，眼巴巴地望着自己已被冻死的七亩番薯，偷偷流泪。他想：单拳独掌怎么也不能改种的呀！早知这样，我就不退组了。要求再参加互助组吧，面子上却又不好看。
    支部很快就了解到柯秀轩的心事。支部书记柯振玉想：这是全乡五百多户个体农民的苦闷呀！党教导我们，不能撇开个体农民不管。于是，他首先组织了一次对全乡抗旱抢种工作的检查。检查的结果，七个没有互助组的村子，都没有行动起来；同时，支部也及时了解到在这严重灾害面前，很多个体农民因已经开始认识到党所指出的互助合作道路是唯一的出路，而要求参加互助组了。支部马上提出“支援后进村，贯彻自愿互利政策，帮助个体农民组织起来”的口号，并且立即派出十一个较强的干部到这些村帮助开展这一工作。
    大岭脚村二十五户农民过去都不愿意参加互助组，说入了组样样要受限制。冻灾过后，全村约三十亩番薯大部分被冻死了。农民望着田垌，垂头丧气，一点办法都没有。真是“单枪匹马万事难”呀！就在这个困难的时候，党派来了干部帮助他们成立了两个互助组（二十一户参加）。互助组成立后，很快地挖出了三口水井，种上了二十来亩早熟作物。几天以后，龙首乡增加了三十二个临时互助组，许多原有的互助组也扩大了。全乡约占百分之八十的农民参加了互助合作组织。在这以前，每天出动挖井种作物的是六、七百人和一百多架水车；这以后，每天出动的就有一千多人和三百五十多架水车了。
    依靠互助合作组织抗旱抢种的结果，现在，龙首乡全乡已经种上了三千一百多亩各种早熟作物，比过去种得最多的年头，还多了两倍以上。许多早种作物已经施肥除草，生长旺盛，早种的蔬菜已经收获完毕。支部还发动农民互助互借，开展各种副业生产，解决了三百户农民的生活困难。目前全乡农民正在满怀信心地计划春季生产，迎接春耕，全乡已准备好了春耕所需的肥料十八万多担。
    中共茂名县委已经对龙首乡支部以及领导抗旱有显著成绩的党员、干部进行了表扬，并作出开展龙首乡运动的决定。中共中央华南分局要求全区农村工作者注意学习龙首乡支部的经验。
