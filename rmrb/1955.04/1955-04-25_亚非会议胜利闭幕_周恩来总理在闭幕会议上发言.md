Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, April 24th – The Asian-African Conference held its closing session at 18:30 Java time on April 24th in the "Independence Hall" of Bandung. After the conference chairman, Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo, announced the beginning of the closing session, the conference's joint secretariat announced that the conference had received numerous congratulatory telegrams, including telegrams from the Presidium of the Great People's Hural of the Mongolian People's Republic and the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    The conference chairman then requested the conference secretary-general, Ruslan Abdulgani, to read the joint communique of the conference and submit it to the conference for adoption.
    The conference unanimously adopted the joint communique amidst prolonged, thunderous applause and cheers.
    Premier Zhou Enlai, chief representative of the Delegation of the People's Republic of China, delivered the following speech at the closing session:
    Respected Chairman, Distinguished Delegates:
    Our conference has been successful. I would first like to express, on behalf of the Chinese delegation, my gratitude to the five Colombo countries for initiating this conference, to the President, Government, and people of the host Republic of Indonesia for their warm hospitality, to the chairman of our conference, the Prime Minister of Indonesia, for his efforts, and to the delegations of all countries for their cooperation, and to the joint secretariat of the conference and all those involved in the conference work for their valuable contributions.
    The achievement of the conference is that it has initiated or enhanced understanding among Asian and African countries and reached agreement on certain major issues, which will greatly help us in our common tasks of opposing colonialism, upholding world peace, and enhancing friendly cooperation with each other. This conference has largely satisfied the aspirations of the Asian and African people and the people of the world.
    This conference reflected that we have different views and opinions on many issues, and we have also discussed them to some extent. However, these different views and opinions did not prevent us from reaching a common agreement with each other. Because we, the people of Asian and African countries, share a common destiny and common aspirations, we have been able to achieve such success in opposing colonialism, upholding world peace, and promoting friendly cooperation in politics, economy, and culture. In this sense, I would like to reiterate that the Chinese people fully sympathize with and fully support the struggle of the people of Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia for self-determination and independence, the struggle of the Arab people for human rights in Palestine, the struggle to restore Indonesia's sovereignty over West Irian, and the just struggles of all Asian and African peoples to break free from colonialism and achieve national independence and people's freedom.
    I would also like to point out that the declaration on promoting peace and cooperation adopted by this conference will help to promote the relaxation of international, especially Far Eastern, tensions. We believe that the agreements on restoring peace in Indochina should be guaranteed by all parties concerned to ensure their full implementation; the peaceful reunification of Korea should be sought through consultations among all parties concerned; and the relaxation and elimination of tensions in the Taiwan area should be resolved by China and the United States sitting down for negotiations, but this should not in the slightest degree affect the Chinese people's just demand to exercise their sovereignty – to liberate Taiwan.
    Finally, I hope that contacts between Asian and African countries and friendly exchanges between peoples will become more frequent from now on.
    I wish the delegates good health, a safe journey home, and goodbye!
    Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, April 24th – The Asian-African Conference concluded at 21:30 on the 24th. After unanimously adopting the joint communique, delegates from various countries then delivered speeches. In addition to the speech by Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China, the following also spoke at the conference: Afghan Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sardar Mohammed Naim Khan, Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Indonesian representative and Foreign Minister Sunarjo, Iranian representative Ali Amini, Iraqi representative Fadil Jamali, Japanese representative Takasaki Tatsunosuke, Lao representative Kat Sasorith, Lebanese representative Sami Solh, Liberian representative Momolu Dukuly, Pakistani representative Mohammed Ali, Philippine representative Carlos Romulo, Sudanese representative Ismail al-Azhari, Syrian representative Khaled al-Azem, Turkish representative Fatin Rüştü Zorlu, Vietnamese representative Pham Van Dong, and Vietnamese representative Nguyen Van Thuan.
    In their speeches, they unanimously praised the achievements of the conference and emphasized the conference's contribution to strengthening the friendship between the peoples of Asia and Africa and to world peace. They also expressed their gratitude to the host country of the conference – Indonesia.
    After the speeches by the above representatives, the chairman of the Asian-African Conference, Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo, delivered a closing address.
    The conference finally declared its conclusion amidst thunderous applause and cheers.

    亚非会议胜利闭幕
    周恩来总理在闭幕会议上发言
    新华社万隆二十四日电　亚非会议四月二十四日爪哇时间十八时三十分在万隆“独立厅”举行闭幕会议。在会议主席、印度尼西亚总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约宣布闭幕会议开始以后，会议联合秘书处宣布会议收到了许多贺电，其中有蒙古人民共和国大人民呼拉尔主席团和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会发来的贺电。
    会议主席接着请会议秘书长鲁斯兰·阿卜杜加尼宣读会议联合公报，提请会议通过。
    会议在长时间的、暴风雨般的鼓掌声和欢呼声中一致通过了联合公报。
    中华人民共和国代表团首席代表周恩来总理在闭幕大会上作了如下发言：尊敬的主席，尊贵的代表先生：
    我们的会议是有成就的。我首先代表中国代表团感谢五个科伦坡国家发起这次会议的倡议，感谢主人印度尼西亚共和国总统、政府和人民的热情招待，感谢我们会议的主席印度尼西亚总理先生的努力和各国代表团的合作，感谢大会联合秘书处和一切参与大会工作的人所作的有价值的贡献。
    会议的成就是开始了、或者增进了亚非各国之间的了解，并在某些主要问题上达成了协议，这对于我们在反对殖民主义、拥护世界和平、增进彼此之间友好合作的共同任务上将有很大帮助。这个会议相当地满足了亚非人民和世界人民的愿望。
    这个会议反映了我们当中对于许多问题的看法和意见是不相同的，我们也曾为此部分地进行了讨论。但是这些不同的看法和意见并没有妨碍了我们彼此之间达成共同协议。因为我们亚非各国人民是具有共同的命运和共同愿望的，所以我们才能够在反对殖民主义、拥护世界和平和促进政治、经济和文化的友好合作上获得了如此成就。在这个意义上，我愿意再一次表示，中国人民完全同情和充分支持阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥、突尼斯人民为自决和独立的斗争，阿拉伯人民在巴勒斯坦所进行的人权斗争，恢复印度尼西亚在西伊里安的主权的斗争，以及一切亚洲和非洲人民为摆脱殖民主义所进行的民族独立和人民自由的正义斗争。
    我还要指出，这次会议通过的促进和平和合作的宣言，将有助于促进国际、首先是远东的紧张局势的和缓。我们认为，恢复印度支那和平的协议应该得到有关各方保证其完全执行；朝鲜的和平统一应该经过有关各方的协商迅速地谋求解决；台湾地区紧张形势的和缓和消除，应该由中国和美国坐下来谈判解决，但不能丝毫影响中国人民行使自己主权——解放台湾的正义要求。
    最后，我希望亚非国家之间的接触和人民的友好来往从此频繁起来。
    祝各国代表们健康，回国旅途平安，再见！
    新华社万隆二十四日电　亚非会议已经在二十四日晚九时三十分结束。会议在一致通过了联合公报以后，接着由各国代表发言。除中华人民共和国总理周恩来发言外，在会上发言的还有：阿富汗副首相兼外交大臣萨达尔·穆罕默德·纳伊姆汗，缅甸总理吴努，印度总理尼赫鲁，印度尼西亚代表、外长苏纳约，伊朗代表阿里·阿米尼，伊拉克代表法迪尔·贾马利，日本代表高碕达之助，老挝代表克特·萨索里斯，黎巴嫩代表萨米·索勒哈，利比里亚代表摩莫卢·杜库利，巴基斯坦代表穆罕默德·阿里，菲律宾代表卡洛斯·罗慕洛，苏丹代表伊斯梅尔·阿扎里，叙利亚代表哈勒德·阿泽姆，土耳其代表法丁·吕斯图·佐鲁，越南民主共和国代表范文同，和越南国代表阮文瑞。
    他们在发言中一致赞扬会议的成就，并强调指出会议对于加强亚非人民之间的友谊和世界和平所作的贡献。他们还对会议的东道国——印度尼西亚表示感谢。
    在上述代表发言后，亚非会议主席、印度尼西亚总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约致闭会词。
    会议最后在暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声中宣告闭幕。
