Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 6th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles once again issued war threats at a press conference on the 5th, attempting to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, Penghu, and other coastal islands.

Dulles clamored that the United States would use American armed forces to "defend" Taiwan and Penghu. He also indicated that the United States, in order to "defend" Taiwan and Penghu, might also have to "defend" Jinmen and Mazu.

While making these war threats in order to seize China's territory, Dulles also attempted to shift the responsibility for the tense situation in the Taiwan area onto the Chinese people. He shamelessly said that "if a war breaks out," the Chinese people would be responsible. Dulles's argument is clearly a clumsy attempt to pre-justify American war provocations in the Taiwan area. From Dulles's remarks, it can also be seen that the so-called "ceasefire" discussions are also part of the U.S. action plan to invade and occupy Taiwan.

When a reporter asked what new steps the United States had taken to achieve a "common attitude" with its allies on the Taiwan issue, Dulles replied that the United States was conducting "very active exchanges of views" with Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and other countries. This shows that the United States is actively seeking "allies" to pull chestnuts out of the fire for it on the issue of invading and occupying Taiwan.

    杜勒斯又发出战争恫吓妄图阻挠我国解放台湾
    新华社六日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯五日在记者招待会上，又一次发出战争恫吓，企图阻挠中国人民解放台湾、澎湖及其他沿海岛屿。
    杜勒斯叫嚷说，美国要用美国武装部队来“保卫”台湾和澎湖。他并且表示，美国为了“保卫”台湾和澎湖的“必要”，还可能要“保卫”金门和马祖。
    杜勒斯在为了霸占中国的领土而进行这种战争威胁的同时，还企图把台湾地区紧张局势的责任推到中国人民身上。他无耻地说什么“如果发生了战争的话”，要由中国人民负责。杜勒斯这种论调显然是他企图为美国在台湾地区的战争挑衅预作辩护的一种拙劣的手法。从杜勒斯的谈话中还可以看到，所谓“停火”的谈论也是美国的侵占台湾的行动计划中的一部分。
    有记者问到美国采取了什么新步骤以求在台湾问题上同美国的盟国有一个“共同态度”，杜勒斯回答说，美国正在同英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、加拿大等国进行“非常积极的交换意见工作”。这表明，美国在侵占台湾问题上，正在积极寻找替它火中取栗的“同盟者”。
