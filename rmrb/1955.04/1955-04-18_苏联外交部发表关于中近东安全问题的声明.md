Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th (Tass): The full text of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's statement on the issue of security in the Middle and Near East.

Recently, the situation in the Middle East and Near East has deteriorated significantly. This is due to new efforts by certain Western countries to draw Middle and Near Eastern countries into military alliances that are being built as appendages to the North Atlantic aggressive bloc.

After the failure in 1951 of the plan to establish a so-called "Middle East Command" due to opposition from Middle and Near Eastern countries, the United States of America and Great Britain adopted measures to draw Middle and Near Eastern countries, either individually or in pairs, into various alliances being established under their protection by roundabout means. Thus, the Turkish-Pakistani agreement was concluded in 1954, and the Turkish-Iraqi military alliance was concluded in February 1955.

The organizers of the Turkish-Iraqi military alliance, by establishing this military alliance, separated Iraq from other Arab countries and worsened relations between these countries, which completely suited the aggressive forces, because they were seeking to sow discord among the countries in this region for their own military-strategic purposes.

Recently, matters have developed to such an extent that ultimatum-like demands have even been made to Syria, requiring it to join the Turkish-Iraqi alliance. These demands are accompanied by intimidation aimed at threatening the government and people of Syria and forcing Syria to change its position of not participating in aggressive military blocs. This action, as well as the task assigned to Turkey by Western countries in establishing military blocs in the Middle and Near East, has caused legitimate unease among Arab countries, which fear that Turkey will attempt to dominate them again, and that their national independence is directly threatened.

Western countries are also exerting great pressure on Egypt, demanding that it change its attitude towards the Turkish-Iraqi bloc, and that it should not support Syria in resisting foreign pressure.

Western countries have also made the same demands of Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia, along with Egypt and Syria, opposes Arab countries' participation in the military blocs that Western countries are forcing them to accept.

Recently, Iran has also been subjected to increasing pressure. The organizers of these military blocs are forcing Iran to embark on a dangerous path.

It is not difficult to see that the policy of establishing military alliances in the Middle and Near East, as well as establishing an aggressive military bloc in Southeast Asia (the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty Organization), is based on the desire of certain Western countries to subject the countries in these regions to colonial enslavement. In order to make their big monopolists richer, Western countries want to continue to exploit the people of the Middle and Near East and greedily utilize these countries' natural resources. Unable to establish or maintain their rule by old methods, these countries are trying to drag Middle and Near Eastern countries into aggressive blocs, claiming that this is in line with the defense needs of the countries in this region.

It is not the Middle and Near Eastern countries that need to establish military blocs in this region, but rather the American aggressors who are seeking to establish their dominance in this part of the world. Such military blocs are also needed by those British groups that are seeking to use such blocs to maintain and restore their shaky position, but this runs counter to the vital interests of the people of the Middle and Near East, who have already begun to embark on the road to national independence.

Indeed, the planners of these military blocs do not actually conceal that they are pursuing their own clear military-strategic goals. This can also be seen from the statements of official spokespersons in the United States and Great Britain. These Western countries view the aforementioned blocs from the perspective of establishing the so-called northern tier of their military system. The fact that Great Britain participated in the Turkish-Iraqi alliance and simultaneously concluded a new British-Iraqi agreement on so-called joint cooperation also confirms this. The new British-Iraqi agreement enslaves Iraq in a new form, allows Great Britain to maintain its military bases in Iraq, and subordinates the Iraqi army to British officers.

These plans to establish aggressive blocs in the Middle and Near East region have nothing in common with the need to maintain peace and security, or with the true national interests of the countries in this region.

These plans once again prove that the Western countries' policy towards the Middle and Near Eastern countries is the same as before, aimed at making these countries politically and economically subordinate to imperialist countries, which want to once again impose the shackles of colonial oppression and exploitation on the people of these countries. In doing so, they completely ignore the fact that the days of restoring that colonial system and enslaving the people of the East are already impossible.

Now the Middle and Near Eastern countries are facing the danger of losing their independence and being dragged into wars fought for foreign interests. Therefore, it is completely understandable that politicians in these countries are increasingly aware of this danger. It is equally understandable that the people of the Middle and Near Eastern countries are increasingly opposed to foreign efforts to make them participate in aggressive military alliances. If the ruling figures of certain Arab countries obediently follow the planners of these alliances, then this will only show how far they have departed from the position that represents the true national interests of their people.

Now, as has been done more than once in the past, efforts are being made to fabricate the absurd claim of a "Soviet threat" to the countries of the Middle and Near East in order to conceal the aggressive nature of the plans of the United States and Great Britain in this region. This fabrication has nothing in common with the actual situation of Soviet foreign policy, which, as everyone knows, is based on the principles of equality, non-interference in internal affairs, and respect for national independence and state sovereignty, and constantly strives to safeguard international peace.

From the first day of its founding, the Soviet state has resolutely condemned the policy of imperialist conquest and colonial oppression, and abolished all unequal treaties concluded by the Tsarist government with Eastern countries.

The Soviet government views the national aspirations of the Eastern people with complete understanding and sympathy. It was the first to recognize the independence of Afghanistan and provided support in Afghanistan's restoration of national sovereignty.

The Soviet government abolished the unequal treaties concluded by the Tsarist government with Iran and handed over to Iran the large amount of material wealth that Russia possessed in Iran.

In the years when Turkey was engaged in a difficult struggle for national independence, the Soviet Union extended a hand of friendship to it and provided it with comprehensive assistance. This assistance played a decisive role in the Turkish people's struggle against foreign interventionists .

 The Soviet government was the very first to recognize Saudi Arabia as an independent country. It supported the struggles for national independence waged by Yemen, Syria, and Lebanon, as well as Egypt's just demand for the withdrawal of foreign troops from its territory.

The Soviet government has consistently supported in international organizations the legitimate demands of the Middle and Near Eastern countries aimed at consolidating their national independence and state sovereignty.

The Soviet Union has consistently pursued, and is now pursuing, a policy of peace and easing international tensions. Its proposals are concrete proof of this, including its suggestions for ending the arms race, banning atomic and hydrogen weapons, immediately and substantially reducing armaments, first and foremost the armaments of the five great powers, and establishing a collective security system in Europe.

It is perfectly obvious that the Soviet Union's policy, which enjoys deep sympathy and support among the people of all countries, is entirely in line with the fundamental national interests of the Middle and Near Eastern countries and the interests of maintaining universal peace.

The threat to the security of the Middle and Near Eastern countries does indeed exist, but it does not come from the Soviet Union, but from those countries which, under the pretext of "defending security," are establishing aggressive blocs in the Middle and Near East, seeking to reduce the countries of this region to the status of their military-strategic bases, and economically reduce these countries to the status of colonies and dependencies.

Needless to say, the Soviet Union cannot remain indifferent to this situation arising in the Middle and Near East region, because the establishment of the aforementioned blocs and the establishment of foreign military bases within the territories of the Middle and Near Eastern countries have a direct impact on the security of the Soviet Union. This position of the Soviet government should be especially understandable, because the Soviet Union is adjacent to these countries, which cannot be said of other foreign countries, such as the United States, because it is thousands of kilometers away from that region.

The non-participation of the Middle and Near Eastern countries in aggressive military blocs will be an important prerequisite for safeguarding their security and the most reliable guarantee of not being drawn into dangerous military gambles.

In order to promote peaceful cooperation between countries, the Soviet government is prepared to maintain and develop cooperation with the Middle and Near Eastern countries in order to consolidate peace in this region.

The Declaration issued by the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on February 9, 1955, stated that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union considers it of paramount importance that relations between all countries, large and small, should be built on international principles that promote the development of international friendly cooperation in peaceful, tranquil living conditions.

The Soviet Union believes that the practical application of those well-known principles mentioned in the aforementioned declaration, namely: equality, non-interference in internal affairs, mutual non-aggression, and mutual respect for territorial integrity, sovereignty, and national independence, will guarantee relations and genuine security between countries.

The Soviet government will take a favorable attitude towards any steps taken by the governments of the Middle and Near Eastern countries to implement these principles in their relations with the Soviet Union, consolidate the national independence of these countries, and strengthen peaceful and friendly cooperation between the people of all countries.

If the policy of applying pressure and threats to the Middle and Near Eastern countries continues, this issue will have to be considered by the United Nations.

The Soviet government, in order to uphold the cause of peace, will defend the freedom and independence of the Middle and Near Eastern countries and will not interfere in their internal affairs.

### 苏联外交部发表关于中近东安全问题的声明

    苏联外交部发表关于中近东安全问题的声明
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科十六日电：苏联外交部关于中近东安全问题的声明全文。
    最近，中东和近东的局势大大恶化了。这是由于某些西方国家作了新的努力，企图把中近东国家拉入正在作为北大西洋侵略集团的附属物而被建立起来的军事联盟。
    在建立所谓“中东司令部”的计划由于遭到中近东国家的反对而在一九五一年失败以后，美利坚合众国和英国就采取了措施，以迂回的办法把中近东国家单个地或成对地拉入正在它们的庇护下而建立起来的各种联盟。这样，土耳其—巴基斯坦协定在一九五四年缔结了，土耳其—伊拉克军事联盟在一九五五年二月缔结了。
    土耳其—伊拉克军事联盟的组织者既然建立了这个军事联盟，就使伊拉克同其他阿拉伯国家分离，并使这些国家之间的关系恶化，而这就完全为侵略势力谋取了方便，因为他们正在设法为他们自己的军事战略目的而在这个地区的国家之间散布不和。
    最近，事情已发展到了这样的程度，以至类似最后通牒的要求竟向叙利亚提出来，要它加入土耳其—伊拉克联盟。在提出这些要求的同时还进行恐吓，目的是要威胁叙利亚的政府和人民，强迫叙利亚改变它的不参加侵略性军事集团的立场。这种行动以及西方国家在中近东建立军事集团方面派给土耳其的任务，在阿拉伯国家之间引起了正当的不安，它们担心土耳其再次企图统治它们，担心它们的民族独立直接受到威胁。
    西方国家也在对埃及施加巨大的压力，要求它改变它的反对土耳其—伊拉克集团的态度，并要求它不应该支持抵抗外国压力的叙利亚。
    西方国家还对沙特阿拉伯提出了同样的要求，因为沙特阿拉伯是同埃及和叙利亚一道，反对阿拉伯国家参加西方国家正强迫它们接受的军事集团的。
    最近，伊朗也正在受到越来越大的压力。这些军事集团的组织者正在强迫伊朗走上一条危险的道路。
    不难看出，在中近东地区建立军事联盟以及在东南亚地区建立一个侵略性的军事集团（即所谓东南亚条约组织）的政策，是基于某些西方国家企图使这些地区的国家遭受殖民奴役的愿望的。西方国家为了使它们的大垄断资本家更肥起来，想要继续剥削中近东的人民，贪婪无厌地利用这些国家的天然资源。这些国家由于不能用旧的方法来建立或维持它们的统治，便设法把中近东国家拖入侵略性的集团，而诡称这是符合这个地区的国家的防御的需要的。
    需要在这个地区建立军事集团的，并不是中近东的国家，而是正在设法在世界的这一部分建立他们的统治的美国侵略分子。这种军事集团也是那些正在设法利用这种集团来保持和恢复他们的动摇地位的英国集团所需要的，但这却是同已经开始走上民族独立发展道路的中近东人民的切身利益相抵触的。
    的确，这些军事集团的策划者实际上并不隐讳他们是在追求他们自己的明确的军事战略目的。这也可以从美国和英国的官方发言人的声明中看出。这些西方国家是从建立它们的军事体系中的所谓北层的角度来看待上述集团的。英国参加土耳其—伊拉克联盟，并且同时缔结一个关于所谓共同合作的新的英国—伊拉克协定一事，也证实了这一点。新的英国—伊拉克协定以一种新的形式来奴役伊拉克，使英国保持它在伊拉克的军事基地，并使伊拉克军队隶属于英国军官。
    这些想在中近东地区建立侵略集团的计划是和维持和平和安全的需要，以及和这个地区国家的真正民族利益毫无共同之处的。
    这些计划再度证明，西方国家对中近东国家的政策同以前一样，目的在于使这些国家在政治上和经济上隶属于帝国主义国家，这些帝国主义国家想再度把殖民压迫和剥削的枷锁强加在这些国家的人民的身上。它们在这样做时完全无视了这样一个事实：要恢复那种殖民制度和奴役东方人民的日子已经是不可能的事了。
    现在中近东国家正面临着丧失它们的独立并被拉入为外国利益而进行的战争的危险。因此，这些国家的政界人士日益感到这种危险，这是完全可以理解的。中近东国家的人民日益反对外国为使他们参加侵略性的军事联盟所作的努力，也同样是可以理解的。如果某些阿拉伯国家的统治人物温顺地跟着这些联盟的策划者走，那末这只会表明他们离开表示他们人民的真正民族利益的立场有多么远。
    现在，正如过去不止一次地做过的那样，有人正在努力捏造关于“苏联威胁”中近东地区的国家的荒谬说法，来掩饰美国和英国在这个地区的计划的侵略性。这种捏造和苏联外交政策的实际情况毫无共同之点，大家知道，苏联的外交政策的基础，是在遵守平等、不干涉内政和尊重民族独立和国家主权的原则的基础上，不断努力保障国际和平。
    苏维埃国家从成立的第一天起，就坚决地谴责帝国主义的征服和殖民压迫的政策，并且废除了沙皇政府和东方国家缔结的一切不平等条约。
    苏联政府以完全的了解和同情的态度看待东方人民的民族愿望，它第一个承认阿富汗的独立，并在阿富汗恢复国家主权方面给予支持。
    苏联政府废除了沙皇政府同伊朗缔结的不平等条约，并把俄国在伊朗拥有的大量物质财富交给了伊朗。
    在土耳其为争取民族独立而进行艰苦斗争的年代，苏联向它伸出了友谊之手，并给它以全面的援助，这种援助在土耳其人民反对外国干涉者的斗争中曾起了决定性的作用。
    苏联政府第一个承认了沙特阿拉伯是一个独立国家，它支持过也门、叙利亚和黎巴嫩所进行的争取民族独立的斗争，以及埃及所提出的外国军队撤离它的领土的正义要求。
    苏联政府在国际组织中一贯支持中近东国家的目的在巩固它们的民族独立和国家主权的合法要求。
      苏联一贯地执行了，并且现在正在执行和平和缓和国际紧张局势的政策。它的建议就具体地证明了这一点，它建议终止军备竞赛，禁止原子武器和氢武器，立即并且大大地裁减军备，首先是裁减五大国的军备，以及在欧洲建立集体安全体系。
      十分明显，在各国人民中受到深切同情和支持的苏联的这种政策，是完全符合中近东国家的基本民族利益和维护普遍和平的利益的。
      对于中近东国家的安全的威胁的确是存在着的，但并不是来自苏联，而是来自这样的一些国家，它们在“保卫安全”的借口下，正在中近东建立侵略性的集团，设法把这个地区的国家降低到成为它们的军事—战略基地的地位，并且在经济上把这些国家降低到殖民地和附属国的地位。
    不用说，苏联对于在中近东地区所产生的这种局势是不能漠不关心的，因为建立上述集团和在中近东国家领土内建立外国军事基地对苏联的安全有直接的影响。苏联政府的这种立场尤其应该是为人所理解的，因为苏联同这些国家是毗邻的，而对其他外国，譬如说美国就不能这样说，因为它离开那个地区有几千公里远。
      中近东国家不参加侵略性的军事集团将是保卫它们的安全的一个重要的前提，是使它们不卷入危险的军事赌博的最可靠的保证。
      为了促进各国之间的和平合作，苏联政府准备维持并发展同中近东国家的合作，以便巩固这个地区的和平。
      苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃在一九五五年二月九日发表的宣言中说，苏联最高苏维埃认为具有非常重大意义的是，一切大小国家之间的关系应该建筑在能促进国际友好合作在和平、宁静的生活条件下发展的国际原则上。
    苏联认为，实际应用上述宣言中所提到的那些著名的原则，这就是：平等，互不干涉内政，互不侵犯，以及互相尊重领土完整、主权和民族独立，那末国和国之间的关系和真正的安全就可以得到保证。
    苏联政府将采取赞同的态度看待中近东国家的政府为在它们和苏联之间的关系中执行这些原则、巩固这些国家的民族独立和加强各国人民之间的和平和友好合作而采取的任何步骤。
    如果对中近东国家施用压力和威胁的政策继续下去的话，这个问题将必须由联合国加以考虑。
    苏联政府为了维护和平事业，将保卫中近东国家的自由和独立，并且不干涉它们的内政。
                    一九五五年四月十六日
