Dialectical Materialism's Epistemology is the Theory of Reflection
Yang Xianzhen

I. Thinking is a Reflection of Existence

The most fundamental question in philosophy is the relationship between thinking and existence, between the spiritual and the natural world. The question of the relationship between thinking and existence is which is primary, spirit or nature, which of the two determines the other. The camps of idealism and materialism are divided on this question. The central issue around which the struggle between materialism and idealism has revolved for thousands of years in the history of philosophy is precisely this question. Today, our struggle against the Hu Shi faction and the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's philosophical ideas is also focused on this fundamental issue. The question of the relationship between thinking and existence is to determine what is primary. But this is one aspect of the question. There is another aspect to this question. Engels said in "Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy": "...The question of the relationship of thinking to being has yet another side: How are our thoughts about the world around us related to that world itself? Is our thinking capable of recognizing the real world? Are we able to form in our ideas and concepts about the real world a correct reflection of reality?"

Materialists answer this question affirmatively, that is, our thinking about the world around us is capable of recognizing the real world, and we are able to form in our ideas and concepts about the real world a correct reflection of reality.

In general, materialism solves the problem of the relationship between thinking and existence as follows:

Existence is primary (existence, i.e., matter, exists independently of human consciousness and does not depend on human will), thinking is secondary;

Thinking is a reflection of existence (spirit is an attribute of matter, and there is no spirit that exists independently of matter in the world; gods and ghosts seem to be such things, but there are no such things in the world).

Idealists, on the other hand, believe that:

Thinking is primary, existence is secondary (or, as the philosophers of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique say, subjective spirit is primary, the objective world is secondary, subjective spirit determines the objective world);

The world is unknowable. This is agnosticism.

Marx once said: "Ideas are nothing more than the reflection of material things." This is the classic formula of materialism for solving the problem of the relationship between thinking and existence. This is the most fundamental principle of the materialist epistemology—the theory of reflection. If we want to correctly understand the world, understand society, understand history, in short, understand everything, we must firmly grasp this principle.

From Marx to Engels, to Lenin and Stalin, to Comrade Mao Zedong, all elucidated epistemology based on this classical formula of reflection. Whoever deviates from this formula will make major errors on the issue of epistemology.

Lenin repeatedly expounded the principle of reflection in "Materialism and Empirio-criticism":

	"To recognize that our theory is a copy, an approximate reproduction of objective reality—that is materialism."
	"The theory of materialism, i.e., the theory that ideas reflect objects... our perceptions or representations are images of things."
	"Things, the world, the environment, exist independently of us. Our sensations, our consciousness, are but images of the external world, and, needless to say, reflection cannot exist without the thing reflected, but the thing reflected exists independently of the reflector. Materialism consciously takes the 'naive' belief of mankind as the foundation of its epistemology."

It must be remembered that only by explaining epistemology with the theory of reflection can one have the only correct epistemology. Some people use the "symbol theory" to explain epistemology, which is bound to make mistakes. Plekhanov's "hieroglyphic theory" is such an epistemology. This theory holds that human sensations and representations are not reproductions of real things and natural processes, not copies of them, but just any kind of marks, symbols, hieroglyphs, and so on. Plekhanov made this mistake on the basic issue of materialism, namely, the issue of epistemology, which is related to his subsequent road to reaction. Plekhanov violated the principles of Marx and Engels regarding the issue of epistemology. Engels did not speak of symbols or hieroglyphs; he spoke of reproductions, images, copies, and reflections of things.

Why is the epistemology of symbol theory wrong?

Because symbol theorists believe that there is no similarity between sensation and the thing it represents. If sensation is not an image of the thing but merely a mark or symbol that has "no similarity" to the thing, then the existence of external objects is quite questionable, because a mark or symbol is entirely possible for imaginary objects.

Lenin said: "It is indisputable that a copy can never be completely identical with the original, but a copy is one thing, and a symbol, a conventional sign, is another. A copy necessarily and inevitably presupposes the objective reality of what it copies. The concept of a 'conventional sign,' symbol, hieroglyph, contains an absolutely unnecessary element of agnosticism."

The establishment of this materialist epistemology—the principle of reflection—shattered the mystery of human understanding of the universe and nature, solved the question of whether the world is knowable or unknowable, and also solved the standard of right and wrong, that is, the standard of correct and incorrect. There must be a standard for the correctness and incorrectness of a theory. With the theory of reflection, there is this standard.

Lenin and Stalin grasped the weapon of the theory of reflection and led the Russian revolution to victory and even built socialism.

Lenin said in "What is to be Done?": "...Marx only studies and explores the real process; Marx believes that the reference of theory to reality is the only yardstick for judging the correctness or incorrectness of a theory."

This is also the standard for judging which of the two lines in the history of the Soviet Communist Party is correct and which is wrong.

Therefore, to study materialism, one must grasp the principle of the theory of reflection. Once you understand the theory of reflection, you understand materialism. If you do not understand the theory of reflection, you do not understand what materialism is. So-called cognition is reflection. Materialist epistemology is the theory of reflection.

Comrade Mao Zedong, like Lenin and Stalin, firmly grasped the principle of the materialist epistemology—the theory of reflection—to lead the Chinese revolution to victory. The struggle between the two lines in the history of the Chinese Party, who is right and who is wrong, is also determined by this issue.

What Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly taught us for decades is to learn to grasp the principle of the theory of reflection and to learn the truth of "unity of the subjective and the objective." Comrade Mao Zedong teaches us this in "On Practice" and in many of his other articles.

He said in "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War" that the key to learning how to do things lies in "properly conforming the subjective and the objective"; in "On Practice," he said that in order to make our work achieve the expected results, our thinking must conform to the laws of the objective external world, and if it does not conform, it will fail in practice; he pointed out that "idealism and mechanical materialism, opportunism and adventurism, are all characterized by the separation of the subjective from the objective and the separation of knowledge from practice," and therefore said, "Our conclusion is the concrete historical unity of the subjective and the objective, theory and practice, knowledge and action, and we oppose all 'Left' or Right erroneous ideas that depart from concrete history." The final paragraph of "On Practice" speaks of "the struggle of the proletariat and the revolutionary people to transform the world, including the realization of the following tasks: transforming the objective world, and also transforming our subjective world—transforming our ability to know, transforming the relationship between the subjective world and the objective world." The so-called transformation of our ability to know means the transformation of our ability to reflect; the so-called transformation of the relationship between the subjective world and the objective world, what kind of relationship is this? It is to enable our subjective world to correctly reflect the objective world, to achieve the unity of the subjective and the objective. This is the so-called problem of transforming ideology. Some people refuse to transform their ideology, which means that they want to make their subjective world forever contradict the objective world and forever fall into erroneous understanding. In 1942, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong proposed a rectification campaign for the entire Party. What was the rectification about? It was the rectification of subjectivism. Why rectify subjectivism? Because the subjectivism of subjectivists cannot correctly reflect the objective, and the subjective and the objective are not consistent. If the subjective and the objective are not consistent, nothing can be done successfully, not to mention the great cause of revolution. Therefore, the rectification is to rectify this inconsistency between the subjective and the objective. Then, why should we rectify the ideological consciousness of the bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie, the landlords, and the rich peasants? Because these ideological consciousnesses are selfish and self-interested, people with such ideological consciousnesses cannot look at problems objectively, cannot correctly reflect objective things, and cannot achieve the unity of the subjective and the objective. There is a law here, which is that without the ideological consciousness of the proletariat, one cannot grasp the ideological methods of Marxism-Leninism. This law has been proven by countless practices.

II. Two Methods of Knowing the World and the Question of the Origin of Knowledge

There are two methods of knowing the world, namely, the method of materialism and the method of idealism. Lenin said in "Materialism and Empirio-criticism": The two basic lines in philosophy are: from things to sensations and thoughts? Or from sensations and thoughts to things? Engels adhered to the first line, the line of materialism; Mach adhered to the second line, the line of idealism.

Idealists believe that thinking and existence are the same thing. Subjective idealists also believe that "things" are nothing more than a "collection of ideas" or a "compound of sensations," and the whole world is nothing more than my representation. Starting from this premise, there can be no one else in the world except myself. This is the purest solipsism. Their ideas or subjective spirit are all innate. The world is in my "heart," in my "ideas," in my "consciousness," in my "subjective spirit." Therefore, to know the world, there is no need to seek externally. Everything is ready in me. One should seek within oneself and "explain the objective world with one's own spirit." This means that their method of knowing the world is from the inside out, "from sensations and thoughts to things." The method of Hu Feng and others for knowing the world is this method, the so-called "self-expansion," using subjective spirit to "embrace" the objective world, probably meaning something like this. I think Mr. Shu Wu's description in "Open Letter to Lu Ling" is very good for using this method of knowing the world to guide their lives. He said: "We fundamentally cancel the issue of the practice of literary and art workers. We rarely even mention the word 'practice,' and only say that we should 'go deep into life.' How do we go deep into life? We also say: There is life everywhere, all lives are interconnected, and we can gain something by going deep anywhere. Furthermore, we particularly emphasize that ordinary and mundane life is 'the most practical life'; its specific content is the extremely narrow private life of petty-bourgeois intellectuals. As a result, those who are so-called 'going deep into life' have become detached from the masses, escaping from practice, shrinking into the snail shell of the petty bourgeoisie, the deeper the better. At that time, we claimed to be 'going deep into life'..." Hiding in the snail shell, the deeper the better, this is how they "go deep" into "life." But this snail shell is not an ordinary snail shell. Living inside, one can carry out "self-expansion," fully exert "subjective action," and create works that "determine the fate of mankind." Living inside the snail shell, the world seen is only so big, as Mr. Shu Wu described, "eyes only revolving around the tip of one's own nose," but they are writers who "determine the fate of mankind." Since they are writers, they cannot be without works. Then, where does the material for creation come from? Or, what is the source of creation? For idealist writers, this is not a problem at all. It is enough to have a genius brain. The world is in my brain, and all things are ready in me. The materials for creation are available in my brain in abundance. What is the source of creation? "Subjective spirit," "personality strength," "self-expansion," "creative attitude," and so on are the sources of artistic creation. Therefore, even living in the snail shell, why can't they create miracles in literature and art?

Isn't this clearly a Machist, that is, a subjective idealist, route of knowing the world "from sensations and thoughts to things"? This is exactly Mr. Hu Feng's route of knowing the world (and he taught this route of knowing the world to others).

Materialists believe that the world, matter, exists independently of human consciousness and does not depend on human will. Then, how does the objective world, matter, reflect in the human brain? Materialists solve this problem according to the route "from things to sensations and thoughts." Lenin said, "Matter acts on our sense organs and causes sensations, and this is precisely materialism."

This involves a very important issue, namely, the origin of cognition or the source of knowledge. "On Practice" deals with this issue based on the materialist route of knowing the world.

Many people do not understand where human knowledge comes from.

Idealists believe that knowledge is the result of psychological activity and is subjectively self-generated. The so-called "innate ideas" means that ideas (or knowledge) are given by God or are naturally born with. The so-called natural sage, born with knowledge, conscience (knowing without learning), and so on, means this.

When Berkeley spoke of the true origin of our sensations, he affirmed that this origin must be God. When speaking of the question of where our experience comes from, he affirmed that experience is directly induced in our hearts by God.

The pragmatist James said that experience is something innate. He said that universal theorems are innate knowledge. He denied the materialist empiricists' view of knowledge as passive and imprinted from the outside, and said that theorems are accidentally proposed from internal experience. This is a kind of idealist empiricism of so-called introspective experience.

James declared: There are two ways for the origin of the ideal system, one is from the sense organs (i.e., sense organs), which comes in from the front door. One is from the experience inside, accidentally different from the outside, which comes in from the back door. Thought itself comes out from the inside, from the back door. Delusions that come in from the back door or arise accidentally may be more important than guests who come in from the front door.

This is the theory of the origin of knowledge expounded by James, one of Hu Shi's ancestors, in his pragmatism.

The philosophy of the French idealist Bergson also had an impact on China. Zhang Dongsun was a follower of Bergson and translated his so-called "Creative Evolution" and other philosophical works. Bergson also spoke of "experience in the heart," saying that what we really know is only experience in the heart. He spoke of "reality is psychological existence" and "matter originates from psychological existence." What China's bourgeois philosophers adhered to and promoted was these things.

Because they do not understand what the source of knowledge is, people cannot find a correct method for seeking knowledge.

For thousands of years in China, until before the May Fourth Movement, many people thought that the source of knowledge was books, especially the books of Confucius. To seek knowledge, one had to read the books of Confucius, called "all other pursuits are inferior, only studying is superior."

When Wang Yangming read "Investigating Things to Attain Knowledge," he had some understanding and vowed to "investigate" the bamboo in front of his courtyard. Although things are not limited to bamboo, bamboo is still a kind of thing. But he "investigated" for several days, not only did he not "investigate" anything, but he made himself "investigate" sick. From then on, he no longer tried to "attain knowledge" from "investigating things." He abandoned this materialist route of seeking knowledge "from things to knowledge" and turned to seeking knowledge from the heart. From then on, he "suddenly realized" that knowledge was in his own heart, that knowledge was originally the "property" that had long been in his heart, called "conscience." This kind of conscience is obscured by selfish desires and cannot break through. As long as this layer of obscuration is removed, knowledge will naturally come out. Therefore, Wang Yangming found a method of seeking knowledge called "attaining conscience." Later, Li Zhuowu appeared, opposing Confucius and saying that "one cannot take the right and wrong of Confucius as right and wrong." This was a very remarkable view at the time, and this view greatly influenced the May Fourth Movement, leading to the slogan "Down with the Confucian Shop." "One cannot take the right and wrong of Confucius as right and wrong," this view is completely correct. But asking further: Whose right and wrong should be taken as right and wrong? Li Zhuowu still returned to the old path of Wang Yangming, saying "take the right and wrong of my heart as right and wrong." This is still taking the "heart" as the source of knowledge and "attaining conscience" as the method of seeking knowledge.

Many of our Communist Party members also do not know where knowledge comes from and also think that knowledge comes from books, but not the books of Confucius, but books about communism, believing that memorizing a few books about communism will give them communist knowledge. Dogmatists once said that half of the Analects can govern the world, and of course, reading many books on Marxism-Leninism can govern China.

Of course, books should be read, but if reading books is regarded as the only method of seeking knowledge, this is wrong. As Lenin taught us:

"If the study of communism consisted solely in assimilating what is written in communist books, pamphlets and other communist publications, we could quite easily obtain communist crammers or braggarts, and it would constantly happen that people who had learned communist writings and books by heart would prove incapable of combining all this knowledge, and would be unable to act as real communists really require." "Without work, without struggle (i.e., without practice - author), book knowledge of communism obtained from communist pamphlets and writings is absolutely worthless." (Emphasis added by the author)

Then, what exactly is knowledge, and how can one obtain true knowledge?

Comrade Mao Zedong said in "Rectify the Party's Style of Work": "Since the existence of class society, there have been only two kinds of knowledge in the world, one is the knowledge of the struggle for production, and the other is the knowledge of class struggle. Natural science and social science are the crystallization of these two kinds of knowledge, and philosophy is the generalization and summary of natural knowledge and social knowledge. What other knowledge is there besides this? There is none."

Here is an explanation of the source of knowledge.

"On Practice" teaches us that knowledge comes from practice. The "practice" mentioned by materialism refers to the struggle for production and class struggle, and is by no means the kind of ordinary, mundane life of eating and sleeping every day, as Mr. Hu Feng said, or even the "struggle" of arguing and seeking love.

In the struggle for production, human beings are in contact with nature every day. Slowly, they have some understanding of the situation of nature, accumulating a lot of production experience, and slowly touching some laws of natural development. Summarizing these experiences and systematizing them, this becomes the knowledge of the struggle for nature. This is how natural science came about.

When society has classes, and human beings live in class society, there are contradictions between the classes, and there is struggle. Especially the oppressed and exploited classes, in carrying out class struggle, have successes and failures, and slowly have some understanding of the situation of society, thus accumulating some experience and slowly touching some laws of social development. Summarizing the experience accumulated from class struggle and systematizing it, this becomes the knowledge of class struggle. This is how social science came about.

No matter what knowledge it is, there is no such thing as innate, natural knowledge.

Comrade Mao Zedong teaches us, "All relatively complete knowledge is composed of two stages: the first stage is perceptual knowledge, and the second stage is rational knowledge. Rational knowledge is the advanced stage of development of perceptual knowledge." If you don't do it (i.e., Lenin's "without work, without struggle"), you cannot obtain perceptual knowledge. Some of our comrades are afraid of making summaries after doing work. They do not understand that the purpose of summarizing work is to raise perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge. Without summarizing or not knowing how to summarize, one cannot raise perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge and can only stay in the low-level stage of knowledge, becoming an empiricist.

The last paragraph of "On Practice" speaks of "discovering the truth through practice, and then confirming the truth and developing the truth through practice. From perceptual knowledge to the active development of rational knowledge, and then from rational knowledge to the active guidance of revolutionary practice, transforming the subjective world and the objective world. Practice, knowledge, re-practice, re-knowledge, this form, repeated endlessly, and the content of each cycle of practice and knowledge is relatively advanced to a higher degree. This is the entire epistemology of dialectical materialism, this is the unity of knowledge and action view of dialectical materialism."

This is the law of development of cognition (or knowledge).

Practice is primary, cognition is secondary. Cognition is a reflection of practice.

With work (practice), there is experience (cognition), but this preliminary experience can only be perceptual knowledge. After summarizing, systematizing the scattered experience, and finding the laws, this is raised to rational knowledge.

III. How is the Objective World Reflected in the Human Brain?

The objective world exists independently of human consciousness and does not depend on human will. Then, how is the image of the world reflected in the human brain, enabling people to have some understanding of the world, even making people have knowledge about the world? "On Practice" says, "The solution of these problems cannot be separated from practice. Whoever wants to know something, apart from contacting that thing, that is, living in (practicing in) the environment of that thing, there is no way to solve it."

In the world from ancient times to the present, both in China and abroad, no one has been found who, from birth, had their heads filled by God with knowledge of all aspects of the world.

Some people also have an idealist understanding of "genius," thinking that "genius" is a natural talent, who, from the time they are born from their mother's womb, are still geniuses even if they sleep every day or hide in a snail shell, all-knowing, all-understanding, and all-powerful. No such "genius" has been found in the world from ancient times to the present, both in China and abroad. There is a good saying in the West: "Genius is diligence." Genius is just a kind of natural talent. A person with some natural talent, plus tireless labor, will surely have some outstanding achievements. This is completely possible.

Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The reason why Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin were able to make their theories is that, in addition to their genius conditions, mainly they personally participated in the practice of class struggle and scientific experiments at that time. Without the latter condition, no genius can succeed."

If there is such a thing: A "genius" is born into the world, and on the night before his birth, "God" universally tells everyone in a dream that a "genius" has been sent. After we know this thing, we violate the will of "God" and isolate this born genius from the world, not allowing him to meet any living person, not allowing him to see the light, and feeding him milk and food in a dark room, and not saying a word to him, raising him like this. I think such a "genius," after growing up, is still just an idiot, just a kind of creature like other creatures.

Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "...Those who truly know are the people who are practicing in the world,... if you want to directly understand something or some things, you can only personally participate in the struggle to change reality and change something or some things, to touch the phenomena of that thing or those things, and only by personally participating in the practice of changing reality can the essence of that thing or those things be exposed and understood. This is the path of cognition that anyone actually takes, but some people deliberately distort it and say some opposing words."

I think that among those who say these opposing words is Mr. Hu Feng, because Mr. Hu Feng exercises his "right to speak" based on his "experience." He announces to the world: You see, I live in a snail shell all my life, and just rely on my innate "subjective fighting spirit" to write works that "determine the fate of mankind." Why bother to participate in any actual life struggle? Eating and sleeping is "the most practical life," "where there is life, there is struggle," "arguing and seeking love" is "struggle." Why do you have to give up the near and seek the far?

It is precisely because knowledge comes from practice that Comrade Mao Zedong always teaches us Communist Party members that we must be able to combine with the masses in whatever problem. He said, "If our Party members sit in the house all their lives and do not go out, do not experience wind and rain, and do not see the world, what good is this kind of Party member to the Chinese people? There is no good at all. We do not need such people to be Party members. Our Communist Party members should experience wind and rain and see the world. This wind and rain is the great wind and rain of mass struggle, and this world is the great world of mass struggle."

It is also precisely because of this that Comrade Mao Zedong taught ordinary intellectuals: "If intellectuals do not combine with the workers and peasants, they will accomplish nothing. The final division of revolutionary or non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals depends on whether they are willing and practice combining with the workers and peasants." Comrade Mao Zedong also said that he put forward a standard here, which he believes is the only standard.

From this, it can be seen that Comrade Mao Zedong is completely based on the principles of the fundamental question in philosophy, the principle that existence is primary and thinking is secondary, the principles of materialist epistemology—the theory of reflection, thinking is a reflection of existence, practice is primary and cognition is secondary, and the principle that cognition comes from practice, to teach our Party cadres and teach them how to acquire knowledge.

    辩证唯物主义的认识论是反映论
    杨献珍
    一、思维是存在的反映
    哲学中最根本的问题是思维对存在、精神对自然界的关系问题。思维对存在的关系问题，就是精神与自然界哪个是第一性的问题，这也就是二者之中哪个决定哪个的问题。唯心主义和唯物主义的阵营就是从这个问题上来划分的。几千年来哲学史上唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争所环绕的中心问题，也就是这个问题。今天我们对胡适派、对胡风小集团的哲学思想进行斗争，也正是集中在这个根本问题上。思维对存在的关系问题，就是决定什么是第一性的问题。但这是这个问题的一个方面。这个问题还有另一个方面。恩格斯在“费尔巴哈与德国古典哲学的终结”中说：“……思维对存在的关系问题，还有另一个方面：我们关于我们周围世界的思想对这个世界本身究竟处于怎样的一种关系呢？我们的思维能否认识现实世界？我们能否在我们的关于现实世界的表象和概念中构成对现实的正确反映？”
    唯物主义者对这个问题的答复是肯定的，就是说，我们关于我们周围世界的思维能够认识现实世界，我们能够在我们的关于现实世界的表象和概念中构成对现实的正确反映。
    总地说来，唯物主义对思维与存在的关系这个问题是这样解决的：
    存在是第一性的（存在即物质，是离开人的意识而独立存在的，不以人的意志为转移的），思维是第二性的；
    思维是存在的反映（精神是物质的属性，世界上没有离开物质而独立存在的精神，上帝鬼神之类似乎是这种东西，但世界上没有这种东西）。
    唯心主义者则相反，他们认为：
    思维是第一性的，存在是第二性的（或如胡风小集团的哲学家们所说，主观精神是第一性的，客观世界是第二性的，主观精神决定客观世界）；
    世界是不可能认识的。这就是不可知论。
    马克思曾经说过：“观念不过是物质底反映。”这是唯物主义解决思维与存在的关系问题的古典的公式。这是唯物主义的认识论——反映论的最根本的原理。我们要想正确地认识世界，认识社会，认识历史，总之，认识一切东西，就必须紧紧地掌握住这个原理。
    从马克思到恩格斯，到列宁、斯大林，到毛泽东同志，都是根据这个古典的反映论的公式来阐明认识论的。谁离开了这个公式，谁就要在认识论的问题上犯大错误。
    列宁在“唯物论与经验批判论”中反复地阐释了反映论的原理：
      “承认理论是模写，是客观实在的近似的复写——这就是唯物主义。”
    “唯物主义的理论，即思想反映对象的理论……我们的知觉或表象乃是物的映象。”
    “物、世界、环境，是不依赖于我们而存在的。我们的感觉、我们的意识，不过是外在世界底映象，并且，不言而喻，没有被反映者，反映就不能存在，可是被反映者是不依赖于反映者而存在的。唯物论自觉地把人类底‘素朴的’信念作为它的认识论底基础。”
    必须记住，只有用反映论来阐释认识论，才是唯一正确的认识论。有些人用“符号论”来说明认识论，这就一定要犯错误。普列哈诺夫的“象形文字论”就是这样的认识论。这种理论认为，人的感觉与表象，不是现实的物与自然过程的复写，不是它们的模写，而是随便一种什么样的记号、符号、象形文字等等。普列哈诺夫在唯物主义的基本问题即认识论问题上犯了这个错误，这与他以后之走上反动道路是有关系的。普列哈诺夫关于认识论问题，违反了马克思、恩格斯的原理。恩格斯既没有说符号，也没有说象形文字，他说的是物的复写、映象、模写、镜像。
    为什么符号论的认识论是错误的呢？
    因为符号论者认为感觉与感觉所表象的东西之间没有任何相似的地方。如果感觉不是物的映象，而只是与物没有“任何相似”的记号或符号，那末，外间对象的存在就颇成疑问了，因为记号或符号对于假想的对象是完全可能的。
    列宁说：“无可争论地，模写决不能和原型完全等同，可是模写是一回事，符号，约束的记号却是另一回事。模写是必然地和不可避免地以它所‘模写’的东西底客观实在性为前提的。‘约束的记号’、符号、象形文字，是包含着完全不必要的不可知论因素的概念。”
    这个唯物主义的认识论——反映论的原理的创立，打破了人类对于宇宙自然的认识的神秘性，解决了世界的可知的或不可知的问题，也解决了是非的标准，即正确与错误的标准问题。理论的正确与错误要有一个标准，有了反映论，这就有了标准。
    列宁、斯大林就是掌握了反映论这个武器，把俄国革命引向胜利以至建成了社会主义。
    列宁在“什么是人民之友？”一书中说：“……马克思只是研究和探讨现实过程；马克思认为理论对现实的参照是判定理论正确与否的唯一准绳。”
    这也正是判定苏共党史上两条路线哪条路线是正确的，哪条路线是错误的标准。
    因此，要学习唯物主义，必须掌握反映论的原理。搞通了反映论，就搞通了唯物主义。不懂得反映论，也就不懂什么是唯物主义。所谓认识，就是反映。唯物主义的认识论，就是反映论。
    毛泽东同志也如列宁、斯大林一样，紧紧掌握了唯物主义的认识论——反映论的原理，才把中国革命引向胜利。中国党的历史上的两条路线的斗争，谁是谁非，也正是决定于这个问题。
    毛泽东同志几十年来反复教导我们的，就是要我们学会掌握反映论原理，学会一个“主观与客观一致”的道理。毛泽东同志在“实践论”中是这样教导我们，在他的许多其他文章中也是这样教导我们。
    他在“中国革命战争的战略问题”中讲，要学会办事，关键在于“把主观和客观二者之间好好地符合起来”；在“实践论”中讲，要使思想合于客观外界规律性，才能使我们的工作达到预期的结果，如果不合，就要在实践中失败；指出“唯心论和机械唯物论，机会主义和冒险主义，都是以主观和客观相分裂，以认识和实践相脱离为特征的”，因而说，“我们的结论是主观和客观、理论和实践、知和行的具体的历史的统一，反对一切离开具体历史的‘左’的或右的错误思想。”“实践论”最后讲到“无产阶级和革命人民改造世界的斗争，包括实现下述任务：改造客观世界，也改造自己的主观世界——改造自己的认识能力，改造主观世界同客观世界的关系”。这里所谓改造自己的认识能力，也就是说改造自己的反映能力；所谓改造主观世界同客观世界的关系，这是一种什么关系呢？就是要使自己的主观世界能够正确地反映客观世界，能够做到主观与客观相一致。这就是所谓改造思想的问题。有些人拒绝改造思想，那就是要使他们的主观世界永远与客观世界相矛盾，永远陷于错误的认识中。一九四二年党中央和毛泽东同志提出全党整风，整什么呢？就是整主观主义。为什么要整主观主义？因为主观主义者的主观不能正确反映客观，主观与客观不一致。主观与客观不一致，做任何事情，都作不成功，且不必说革命的大事情了。所以，整风就是整这个主观与客观的不一致。那末，为什么还要整资产阶级、小资产阶级、地主、富农的思想意识呢？因为这些思想意识都是自私自利的东西，有这样的思想意识的人，就不能客观地看问题，就不能正确反映客观事物，就不能达到主客观一致。这里有一条规律，就是，没有无产阶级的思想意识，就不能掌握马克思列宁主义的思想方法。这一条规律是为无数次的实践所证明了的。
      二、认识世界的两种方法和知识的起源问题
    认识世界有两种方法，即唯物主义的方法和唯心主义的方法。列宁在“唯物论与经验批判论”中讲：哲学上的两条基本路线，是从物到感觉和思想呢？还是从感觉和思想到物呢？恩格斯是坚持第一条路线，即唯物主义的路线的；马赫是坚持第二条路线，即唯心主义的路线的。　　唯心主义者认为思维与存在是同一的东西，主观唯心主义者还认为“物”不过是“观念底集合”或“感觉底复合”，整个世界不过是我的表象而已。从这个前提出发，世界上除自己以外，就不能有任何其他的人存在。这是最纯粹的唯我主义。他们的观念或主观精神又都是天生的。世界就在我的
  “心”中，在我的“观念”中，在我的“意识”中，在我的“主观精神”中，所以，要认识世界，不假外求，万物皆备于我，返求诸己，“以自己的精神来说明客观世界”就行了。这就是说，他们认识世界的方法，是从内到外，“从感觉和思想到物”。胡风等人的认识世界的方法就是这种方法，所谓
  “自我扩张”，用主观精神去“拥抱”客观世界，大概就是这样的意思。用这样的认识世界的方法来指导他们的生活，我觉得舒芜先生在“致路翎的公开信”中描写的非常好。他说：“对于文艺工作者的实践的问题，我们根本把它取消。我们甚至于连‘实践’两个字都极少提起，只说要‘深入生活’。怎样深入生活呢？我们又说：哪里都有生活，一切生活都是相通，随处深入下去都有所得。更进一步，我们又特别强调日常平凡生活，才是‘最实际的生活’；其具体内容，就是小资产阶级知识分子那些极其狭隘的私生活。这样一来，所谓‘深入生活’者，恰恰成了脱离群众，逃避实践，缩在小资产阶级的蜗牛壳里，缩得越深越好了。当时我们就自命是‘深入生活’……。”缩在蜗牛壳里，缩得越深越好，他们“深入生活”就是这样“深入”法的。可是这个蜗牛壳不是平凡的蜗牛壳，住在里边，能够进行
  “自我扩张”，能够充分发挥“主观作用”，能够创造出“决定着人类命运”的作品。住在蜗牛壳里边，所看到的世界就只有那么大，如舒芜先生所描写的，“眼光只在自己鼻子尖上打转”，可是他们又是“决定着人类命运”的作家，既是作家，就不能没有作品，那么，创作的材料从哪里来呢？或者说，创作的源泉是什么呢？这在唯心主义的作家，根本不成问题，只要有一副天才的头脑就够了。世界就在我的头脑中，万物皆备于我，创作材料在我的头脑中应有尽有，丰富得不得了。什么是创作的源泉？“主观精神”“人格力量”“自我扩张”“创作态度”等等就是艺术创作的源泉。因此之故，就是住在蜗牛壳里，为什么不能创造出文学艺术上的奇迹来呢？
    这岂不是明明白白的一条马赫主义的即主观唯心主义的“从感觉和思想到物”的认识世界的路线么？胡风先生的认识世界的路线（他并把这条认识世界的路线教给别人），正是如此。
    唯物主义者认为，世界、物质是离开人的意识而独立存在的，是不依人的意志为转移的。那末，客观世界、物质怎样反映到人的头脑中来呢？唯物主义者是按照“从物到感觉和思想”的路线来解决这个问题的。列宁说，“物质作用于我们的感觉器官而引起感觉，这正是唯物主义。”
    这里就涉及到一个非常重要的问题，即认识的起源或知识的来源问题。“实践论”就是根据唯物主义的认识世界的路线来处理这个问题的。
    许多人搞不清楚人的知识是从哪里来的。
    唯心主义者认为，知识是心理活动的结果，是主观自生的。所谓“天赋观念”，即是说，观念
  （或知识）是上帝给予的。或自然而然生来就有的。所谓天纵之圣，生而知之，良知（不学而知）等等，就是这个意思。
    贝克莱讲到我们的感觉的真正的起源时，肯定地说，这个起源一定是神。讲到我们的经验是从哪里来的这个问题时，肯定地说，经验是由神直接在我们的内心引起来的。
    实用主义者詹姆士说，经验是先天的东西。他说，普遍定理是先天的知识。他否认唯物主义的经验派把知识看作是被动的、从外面印上去的讲法，而说定理是从内在经验中偶然提出来的。这是一种所谓内省体验的唯心主义的经验论。
    詹姆士宣称：理想体系的起源有两条路，一条是从官能感觉（即感觉器官）来的，是从前门进来的。一条是从内面经验上偶然发生的与外面不同的，是从后门进来的。思想自身是从内面出来的，是从后门进来的。从后门进来的或偶然起来的妄想，也许比从前门进来的客人格外重要。
    这就是胡适的老祖宗之一詹姆士的实用主义所讲的知识起源论。
    法国唯心主义者柏格森的哲学，对中国也是有影响的，张东荪就是柏格森的信徒，译过他的叫做什么“创化论”及其他哲学著作。柏格森也讲什么
  “心中的经验”，他说，我们所真正知道的只是心中的经验。他讲“实在就是心理的存在”，讲什么
  “物质起源于心理的存在”。中国的资产阶级哲学家所宗奉、宣传的就是这些东西。
    由于不懂得知识的来源是什么，所以人们也就找不到一个求知识的正确方法。
    中国几千年以来，一直到“五四”以前，许多人都以为知识的来源是书本，特别是孔夫子的书，人们要求知识，就得读孔夫子的书，叫做“万般皆下品，惟有读书高”。
    王阳明读书，读到“格物致知”的时候，颇有所悟，发奋去“格”他的庭前的竹子。物虽不尽是竹，但竹总是一种物。可是他“格”了好几天，不但没有“格”出什么名堂来，反而把自己“格”病了，从此再也不从“格物”去“致知”了。他放弃了“从物到知”的这一条求知识的唯物主义的路线，于是便转而求诸心，从此便“恍然大悟”，原来知识就在自己的心里面，知识本来是自己心里早就有的“家当”，叫做“良知”。这种良知，为私欲所蔽，冲不出来，只要去掉这一层障蔽，知识就自然而然出来了。因此，王阳明就找出来了一条
  “致良知”的求知识的方法。后来又出了一个李卓吾，反对孔夫子，说“不能以孔子之是非为是非”，这在当时是一种非常卓越的见解，这个见解后来还大大地影响了五四运动，因而出现了“打倒孔家店”的口号。“不以孔子之是非为是非”，这种见解完全对。可是再问一句：究竟以怎样的是非为是非呢？李卓吾依然回到了王阳明的老路，说“以吾心之是非为是非”。这仍然是以“心”为知识的来源，以“致良知”为求知识的方法。
    我们共产党员中也有许多同志不知道知识是从何处来的，也以为知识是从书本来的，不过不是孔夫子的书，而是讲共产主义的书，认为死啃几本讲共产主义的书，便有了共产主义的知识了。教条主义者曾说，半部论语可以治天下，读了许多马克思列宁主义的书，当然就可以治中国了。
    当然书是要读的，可是，如果把读书当作唯一的求知识的方法，这就不对了。如列宁教导我们的：
    “如果说，研究共产主义只限于通晓共产主义著作、书本和小册子里的东西，那末我们也就很容易造就出一些共产主义的书呆子或吹牛家，而这是往往会使我们受到损害的。因为这种人虽把共产主义书本上的东西都读得烂熟，却不善于将这一切知识融会贯通，也不会按共产主义的真正要求去实际行动。”“没有工作，没有斗争（即没有实践——作者），那末单从共产主义小册子和著作中求得的书本上的共产主义知识，可以说是一文钱不值的”。（着重点是作者加的）
    那末，到底什么叫做知识，怎样才能取得真正的知识？
    毛泽东同志在“整顿党的作风”中讲：“什么是知识？自从有阶级的社会存在以来，世界上的知识只有两门，一门叫做生产斗争知识，一门叫做阶级斗争知识。自然科学、社会科学，就是这两门知识的结晶，哲学则是关于自然知识和社会知识的概括和总结。此外还有什么知识呢？没有了。”
    这里就说明了知识的来源问题。
      “实践论”教导我们，知识来源于实践。唯物主义所说的“实践”，就是指的生产斗争和阶级斗争，绝不是如胡风先生所说的每个人每天吃饭睡觉那类日常平凡生活，以至吵架求爱之类的“斗争”。
    人类在生产斗争当中，天天与自然界接触，慢慢地对于自然界的情况有所认识，积累下了许多生产经验，慢慢地摸着一些自然发展规律。把这些经验总结起来，加以系统化，这就成为自然斗争知识。自然科学就是这样来的。
    社会有了阶级，人类生活在阶级社会中，各阶级之间有矛盾，就有斗争，特别是被压迫、被剥削阶级，在进行阶级斗争中，有成功的，有失败的，慢慢地对于社会的情况有所认识，因而积累了一些经验，并慢慢地摸到了一些社会发展规律。把这些由阶级斗争所积累的经验总结起来，加以系统化，这就成为阶级斗争知识。社会科学就是这样来的。
    不管什么知识，先天的、天生的知识是没有的。　　毛泽东同志教导我们，“一切比较完全的知识，都是由两个阶段构成的：第一阶段是感性知识，第二阶段是理性知识，理性知识是感性知识的高级发展阶段。”不干（即列宁说的“没有工作，没有斗争”），就不能取得感性知识。我们有些同志，作了工作，怕作总结。他们不懂得，总结工作的目的，就是要把感性知识提高到理性知识。不总结或不会总结，就不能把感性知识提高到理性知识，就只能停留于知识的低级阶段，而成为经验主义。
    “实践论”的最后一段讲，“通过实践而发现真理，又通过实践而证实真理和发展真理。从感性认识而能动地发展到理性认识，又从理性认识而能动地指导革命实践，改造主观世界和客观世界。实践、认识、再实践、再认识，这种形式，循环往复以至无穷，而实践和认识之每一循环的内容，都比较地进到了高一级的程度。这就是辩证唯物论的全部认识论，这就是辩证唯物论的知行统一观。”
    这就是认识（或知识）的发展规律。
    实践是第一性的，认识是第二性的。认识是实践的反映。
    有工作（实践），就有经验（认识），但这初步的经验，还只能是感性认识，经过总结，把零散的经验系统化，找出规律，这就提高到理性认识了。
    三、客观世界如何反映于人的头脑中？
    客观世界是离开人的意识而独立存在的，不依人的意志为转移的，那末，世界的形象怎样反映到人的头脑中来，使人对于世界有所认识，即使人有了关于世界的知识？“实践论”中讲，“这些问题的解决，一点也不能离开实践。无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的。”
    世界上自古至今，中国外国，没有发现过一个这样的人，他一生下来，满脑袋就被上帝给他装满了关于世界的各方面的知识。
    有些人对于“天才”也是作了唯心主义的了解，以为“天才”就是天生的才子，从娘肚子生下来以后，就是天天睡觉，或者缩在蜗牛壳里，也还是天才，无所不知，无所不晓，无所不能。世界上自古至今，中国外国，也找不出这样的“天才”。西洋有一句格言说得很好：“天才就是勤奋”。天才不过是一种自然才能。一个人有了某种自然才能，再加上不倦的劳动，必定能有某种卓绝的成就，这是完全可能做到的。
    所以毛泽东同志讲：“马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林之所以能够作出他们的理论，除了他们的天才条件之外，主要地是他们亲自参加了当时的阶级斗争和科学实验的实践，没有这后一个条件，任何天才也是不能成功的。”
    如果有这样的事情：一个“天才”生到世界上来了，在他降生的前一晚上，蒙“上帝”在梦中普遍告诉大家，说给送来了一个“天才”。我们知道了这件事情之后，我们却违反着“上帝”的意旨，把这个生下的天才，与人世隔绝起来，不叫他同任何活人见面，不叫他见到光线，吃奶、吃饭，都在暗室里给他吃，也不给他说一句话，这样把他养大。我看这样的“天才”长大以后，仍然不过是一个白痴，不过是一个与其他生物一样的一种生物而已。
    所以毛泽东同志说：“……真正亲知的是天下实践着的人，……如果要直接地认识某种或某些事物，便只有亲身参加于变革现实、变革某种或某些事物的实践的斗争中，才能触到那种或那些事物的现象，也只有在亲身参加变革现实的实践的斗争中，才能暴露那种或那些事物的本质而理解它们。这是任何人实际上走着的认识路程，不过有些人故意歪曲地说些反对的话罢了。”
    我看说这些反对话的人，其中就有胡风先生，因为胡风先生根据他的“经验”实行他的“发言权”，他向世界宣告：你们看，我一生一世住在蜗牛壳里，就只凭我的天生的“主观战斗精神”，就能够写出“决定着人类命运”的作品，何必要去参加什么实际的生活斗争呢？吃饭睡觉就是“最实际的生活”，“哪里有生活，哪里就有斗争”，“吵架求爱”，就是“斗争”，你们何必舍近而求远呢？
    正因为知识来源于实践，所以毛泽东同志总是教导我们共产党员，无论在什么问题上，一定要能够同群众相结合。他说，“如果我们的党员，一生一世坐在房子里不出去，不经风雨，不见世面，这种党员，对于中国人民究竟有什么好处没有呢？一点好处也没有的，我们不需要这样的人做党员。我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”
    也正因为如此，所以毛泽东同志教导一般知识分子说：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”毛泽东同志还说他在这里提出了一个标准，他认为是唯一的标准。
    于此可见，毛泽东同志完全是依据哲学上的根本问题的原理，存在是第一性的，思维是第二性的原理，依据唯物主义的认识论——反映论的原理，思维是存在的反映，实践是第一性的，认识是第二性的，认识来源于实践的原理，来教导我们的党员干部，教导他们如何取得知识的。
