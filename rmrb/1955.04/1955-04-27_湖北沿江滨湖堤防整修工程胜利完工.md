    Hubei's Yangtze River, Han River, and lakeside area levee renovation project has been fully completed on April 25th, with the exception of Wuhan City, where construction is being accelerated. Many important levees along the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the lower reaches of the Han River have been made taller and larger after renovation. The Jingjiang levee, known as the "lifeline" by millions of people in the Jianghan Plain, has some dangerous sections as high as eleven meters and as wide as twenty to thirty meters.
    The person in charge of the Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Project Headquarters told the Xinhua News Agency reporter: "In 1954, the levees along the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the lower reaches of the Han River withstood the extraordinary floods unseen in a century, protecting the industrial cities of Wuhan, Huangshi, and the lives and property of millions of people in the Jianghan Plain. These levees were eroded by the floods for a long time, and many places needed to be reinforced and repaired. Now, the province's levees have been generally renovated and reinforced, and the quality of the project is generally good. Now, even if we encounter extraordinary floods like those of 1954, these levees can withstand the flood's attack."
    The Hubei Provincial Yangtze River and Lakeside Levee Renovation Project started in November 1954. The scale of the project in the province was enormous, with the amount of earthwork alone equivalent to the total amount of earthwork in the annual repairs over the past five years since liberation. The state has successively allocated more than 47 million yuan for the project. A large amount of grain was transferred from Guangdong, Hunan, Sichuan and other places to supply the workers, ensuring the smooth progress of the project. (Xinhua News Agency)

    湖北沿江滨湖堤防整修工程胜利完工
    湖北省长江、汉水沿岸和滨湖地区的堤防整修工程，除武汉市正加紧施工外，其他各项工程已在四月二十五日全部完工。长江中游和汉水下游许多重要堤防，整修后，都比原来高大。江汉平原数百万人民称为“命堤”的荆江大堤，有些险要堤段高达十一公尺，宽二十公尺到三十公尺。
    湖北省水利工程总指挥部负责人对新华社记者说：“一九五四年，长江中游、汉水下游的堤防挡住了百年来没有的特大洪水，保卫了武汉、黄石等工业城市和江汉平原千百万人民生命财产的安全。这些堤防受洪水侵蚀时间较长，不少地方需要加固和培修。现在，全省堤防已经普遍进行了整修加培工作，工程质量一般较好。现在，即使遇到一九五四年那样的特大洪水，这些堤防也能抵御洪水的侵袭。”
    湖北省沿江滨湖堤防整修工程是一九五四年十一月开工的。全省工程规模浩大，仅土方数量就相当于解放五年来岁修工程中土方数量的总和。国家先后拨出工程经费达四千七百多万元。并从广东、湖南、四川等地调来供民工们食用的大批粮食，保证了工程顺利进行。　（新华社）
