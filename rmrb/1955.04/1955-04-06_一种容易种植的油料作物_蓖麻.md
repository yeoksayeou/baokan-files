　　Castor is one of the major oil crops in our country. In warmer climates such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, perennial castor beans have been planted for many years. These castor plants can live for twenty or thirty years and bear fruit every year. In the Yangtze and Yellow River basins northwards, and in regions like Inner Mongolia, Northeast China, and Northwest China, the castor beans planted are annual, blooming and bearing fruit in the same year they are sown, and dying off after autumn. The leaves of the castor plant resemble outstretched fingers, but are much larger than a hand. Planting castor beans in front of and behind houses can provide shade for small livestock and poultry in the summer; planting them on field ridges can also protect crops. The outside of castor fruit usually has soft spines, and when ripe, it will crack open on its own, revealing three seeds with beautiful shells inside.

　　Castor seeds have a very high oil content; one hundred jin of seeds can yield more than forty jin of oil, and the quality is good with a wide range of uses. Castor oil produces a bright light and little smoke when used for lamps. In the aviation industry, castor oil can be used as a lubricant. Castor oil can also be used as a raw material for manufacturing soap, candles, etc. In addition, castor oil has great medicinal uses, such as a mild laxative. In Guangdong and other places, castor leaves are used to feed castor silkworms.

　　Castor plants are highly adaptable and can grow in general soils (even weakly alkaline soils) as long as there is good drainage. Therefore, they can be planted along roadsides, field edges, barren hills, cemeteries, and unused land in front of and behind houses. In addition to scattered plots of land, areas with large tracts of barren hills can plant annual or perennial castor beans, which can not only produce a large amount of oil but also play a role in greening the wilderness and conserving soil and water. In 1953, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region used large tracts of barren land to plant more than 600,000 mu of castor beans, producing more than 460,000 dan of castor seeds for the country.

　　Castor cultivation is simple and management is relatively easy. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams can fully organize women, children, and other semi-laborers to do the work. In southern China, perennial castor beans can be sown in mid-to-late March or August-September. Annual castor beans in the area north of the Yangtze River and south of the Yellow River are generally sown around mid-April, and north of the Yellow River can be sown in early to mid-May. This year, many regions have decided to expand the castor planting area in a planned manner. Guangdong Province plans to develop 180,000 mu of perennial castor beans.

    一种容易种植的油料作物——蓖麻
　　蒋声和
    蓖麻是我国主要油料作物之一。在广东、广西、福建、四川、贵州、云南等气候比较温暖的地区，都种植多年生的蓖麻。这种蓖麻能活二、三十年，每年都能结实。在长江、黄河流域以北地区和内蒙古、东北、西北等地区所种植的蓖麻，都是一年生的蓖麻，下种后当年开花结实，秋后枯死。蓖麻的叶子有些像伸开手指的手掌，但是比手掌要大很多。把蓖麻种在屋前屋后，可以供小家畜、小家禽夏季纳凉；种在田坎地边，也可以起到防护庄稼的作用。蓖麻果实外面，一般生有软刺，成熟后会自行裂开，果实里有三粒外壳美丽的种子。
    蓖麻子含油量很高，一百斤种子可以榨油四十多斤，而且品质好，用途广泛。用蓖麻油点灯，光大烟少。在航空工业上，蓖麻油可作润滑油。蓖麻油还可做制造肥皂、蜡烛等的原料。此外蓖麻油在医药上用途也很大，可作缓泻剂等。在广东等地，蓖麻叶是喂养蓖麻蚕的饲料。
    蓖麻的适应性强，一般土壤（甚至弱碱土）只要排水良好，都可以生长。因此公路两旁、田边地头、荒山坟场以及宅前屋后的隙地都可以种植。除零星土地外，有大片荒山的地区，可以种植一年生或多年生蓖麻，不但可以生产大量的油料，还可起绿化原野、保持水土的作用。一九五三年内蒙自治区利用大片荒地播种蓖麻六十多万亩，为国家生产了蓖麻子四十六万多担。
    蓖麻栽培方法简单，管理也比较容易，农业生产合作社和互助组，可以充分组织妇女、儿童等半劳动力来做。我国南方种植的多年生蓖麻，在三月中、下旬或八、九月间都可播种。一年生蓖麻在长江流域以北黄河以南地区，一般在四月中旬左右播种，黄河以北可在五月上、中旬播种。今年许多地区决定要有计划地扩大蓖麻种植面积。广东省就计划发展多年生蓖麻十八万亩。
