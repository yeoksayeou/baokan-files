Rectifying Agricultural Production Cooperatives Should Not Be Hasty
    Yang Ye

    The rectification of agricultural production cooperatives is a meticulous and complex task and should never be approached hastily.

    Some work teams, upon arriving in a village, would summon the cooperative's cadres and ask: "Have you established the cooperative's charter?" "Do you have a production plan?" "Are the members all volunteers?" "Have you established a labor organization?" If they received affirmative answers, they would consider their work done and immediately move on to another village to "rectify"; in just a few days, they would have "rectified" dozens of cooperatives. Some work teams would simply convene a meeting of the cooperative's members upon arrival, announcing, "Those who wish to stay may stay, those who wish to leave may leave," without considering or resolving the specific issues of staying or leaving. Some work teams would merely give the cooperative cadres and members a lecture on "the four criteria for running a cooperative well," talk about the principles of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, and the importance of formulating production plans and implementing a work-point system, without studying the specific circumstances or resolving specific problems. Some work teams, seeing that some cooperatives had many problems, would adopt a "let it go" attitude, arbitrarily announcing "reorganization"; or, seeing that the cooperative cadres were "too weak," would immediately "take matters into their own hands," doing everything themselves, drafting charters and production plans. What effect can such "rectification" of agricultural production cooperatives have?

    Rectifying agricultural production cooperatives should be done promptly, and in the case of many newly established cooperatives with numerous problems, rectification work can be carried out in defined stages. However, this work must not be treated as a crash campaign, nor should an absolutely uniform deadline be set for it. Some areas in Hebei Province have set short deadlines for rectifying agricultural production cooperatives and demanded their completion within the prescribed time. This inevitably leads to some places acting hastily. In addition, some places mechanically prescribe "steps" for rectification, proceeding slowly; by the time the rectification is completed, the spring plowing season has long passed. This may seem very "meticulous," but in reality, it is often also hasty; and because it is divorced from production, it is impossible to rectify the cooperative well.

    Slow and drawn-out delays are unacceptable, and hasty crash campaigns are also unacceptable. In areas where spring plowing and sowing work has already begun, agricultural production cooperatives where all specific policy issues have not yet been resolved or are difficult to resolve for the time being, of course, cannot simply become entangled in these issues; however, they must not be "let go" hastily. It is best to first resolve the issues of labor organization, labor calculation, and production investment, which are directly related to spring plowing production, and then use the production gap after sowing to meticulously resolve other issues. It is unrealistic to attempt to resolve all issues related to consolidating agricultural production cooperatives at once.

### 整顿农业生产合作社不应草率

    整顿农业生产合作社不应草率
    杨叶
    整顿农业生产合作社是一项细致复杂的工作，决不能草率从事。
    有的工作组到了村子里，把合作社干部找了来，问：“订了社章没有？”“有了生产计划没有？”“社员都自愿吗？”“建立了劳动组织没有？”如果得到了肯定的答复，他们就认为工作已经结束，立刻转到另一个村子去“整顿”；几天就把几十个社“整顿”完了。有的工作组到村就召开社员大会，简单地宣布一声“愿留者留，愿退者退”，根本不去考虑和解决去留的具体问题。有的工作组只是对合作社干部和社员群众讲一通
  “办好社的四条标准”，讲一讲自愿互利的原则和订生产计划、实行包工制的重要性，而不研究具体情况，也不解决具体问题。有的工作组看到有些合作社的问题比较多，就采取“不了了之”的态度，随意宣布“改组”；或者看到合作社干部“能力太弱”，立即“亲自动手”，包办代替，订出社章和生产计划。照这样“整顿”农业生产合作社，能起什么作用呢？
    整顿农业生产合作社是应当抓紧时间的，在许多新建立的合作社存在很多问题的情况下，也可以划分一定的阶段进行整顿工作。可是，决不可把这项工作当作一个突击任务，也不可给这项工作规定绝对划一的期限。河北省有些地区为整顿农业生产合作社规定了短促的期限，并限期完成。这样，就难免有些地方草率从事。另外，有些地方机械地规定整顿的“步骤”，慢吞吞地进行整顿；等整顿完了，春耕季节早已过去了。这样做，好像很“细致”，但是实际上也往往是草率的；并且因为同生产脱节了，也不可能把社整顿好。
    慢吞吞地拖延是不行的，仓促地突击也不行。春耕播种工作已经开始的地区，所有有关具体政策的问题还没有解决或一时难以解决的农业生产合作社，当然不能只是纠缠在这些问题上；可是，也决不可草率地“不了了之”。最好是首先解决直接有关春耕生产的劳动组织、劳动计算、生产投资等几个问题，等播种完毕之后，再利用生产空隙细致地解决其它问题。企图一次就把有关巩固农业生产合作社的问题全部解决，那是不切实际的。
