Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 29th: The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions on April 10th regarding the rectification of rural grain unified purchase and sales work. The instructions pointed out that in the first quarter of this year, the province's grain sales volume increased by 35% compared to the same period last year, and the original sales plan for the first quarter had been exceeded. The instructions stated that since March, this serious situation has prompted party committees at all levels to pay attention to rectifying grain unified purchase and sales work, and progress has been made in this regard. Many typical materials prove that in areas where rectification work is well done, it is possible to realistically guarantee the supply of grain to grain-deficient farmers based on the existing grain sales quotas. According to statistics from 196 villages (14,378 households) in Huaiyang County, grain supply could be reduced by more than 264,000 jin due to the rectification work. According to investigations in Lin County, Neihuang, and two other counties, 45% of the townships could reduce the supply. Conversely, those who are unaware of the situation, blindly demanding more grain, and failing to earnestly inspect and rectify the work, will not be able to solve the grain supply problem.

The instructions stated that the rectification of grain unified purchase and sales work should be combined with production. It is necessary to fully mobilize the masses and explain to the farmers the state's measures to guarantee the supply of grain to grain-deficient farmers. It is necessary to do a good job in the ideological mobilization of party and Communist Youth League members, and encourage them to conduct self-examination based on increased awareness. According to statistics from the Huaiyang County expanded cadre meeting, 462 of the 482 attendees had received grain purchase certificates. After inspection, it was found that 153 people had received supplies that they should not have received or had received more than they should have. While guaranteeing supply, they could return a total of more than 22,000 jin of surplus grain. The instructions concluded by saying that in the rectification of grain unified purchase and sales work, the national grain market should also be restored because some farmers still have surplus grain for sale.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 29th: The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued an urgent instruction on April 15th to vigorously rectify rural grain unified purchase and sales work. The instruction stated that doing a good job in rectifying grain unified purchase and sales work is one of the main links in the current overall rural work. The instructions required party committees at all levels to strengthen leadership, combine with the focus of work according to different regional conditions, rely on party branches, township cadres, and the masses to carry out the rectification work deeply into the townships, agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and even individual households. In the work, it is first necessary to ideologically arm district and township cadres and strengthen their confidence in doing a good job in the current grain supply work. Continue to deeply publicize and implement the "Three Fixes" policy and current grain supply policy among the masses, clarify the guarantee of grain supply to grain-deficient households, dispel the doubts and misunderstandings of some of the masses, ensure that households with enough to eat and those with surplus grain do not buy grain, call on the masses to save grain, mobilize the masses to produce food to get through lean periods in various ways, promote the planting of vegetables and summer crops, and announce that the grain saved by the masses can be borrowed and exchanged within a township to adjust grain surpluses and shortages, and allow sales at the national grain market.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, April 29th: The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions on April 18th, requiring party committees at all levels to regard the rectification of grain unified purchase and sales work as an extremely important political and economic measure to stabilize the productive mood of the masses and ensure spring plowing. The instructions cited facts to illustrate the real reasons for the tight grain supply. The results of the rectification of unified purchase and sales work in seven townships and five villages in Liangshan, Yuncheng, Juye, and Cao County showed that there were 243 households that should have been issued grain purchase certificates but had not been issued, but there were 620 households that should not have been issued grain purchase certificates or should have received less but received more. After persuasion and education of these farmers, a total of 475,000 jin of grain purchase certificates were voluntarily returned or the amount of grain purchased was reduced. Therefore, the instructions required that in the rectification work, cadres should first realize that the real reason for the tight grain supply is that those who should not be supplied are supplied and those who should be supplied less are supplied more. The instructions called on cadres to lead by example, go deep among the masses, and solve the grain supply problem realistically. The instructions stated that this work must be carried out under the leadership of the CCP township branch. After the grain sales quota is issued to the township, a meeting of the township people's congress should be convened to announce it and discuss the supply principles and supply targets after investigation and research. The instructions concluded by saying that it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the national grain market and announce to the farmers that the 1954 grain unified purchase has ended, and that farmers with surplus grain and those who need to exchange grain seeds can sell them at the national grain market or conduct mutual adjustments between farmers.

    中共河南、湖北、山东省委分别发出指示
    要求各级党委认真整顿农村粮食统销工作
    据新华社郑州二十九日电　中共河南省委四月十日发出关于整顿农村粮食统销工作的指示。指示指出，今年第一季度全省粮食销售量比去年同期增加了百分之三十五，原订第一季度销售计划已被突破。指示说，三月份以来，这种严重情况，已引起各级党委对整顿粮食统销工作的重视，并在这方面取得了成绩。许多典型材料证明：凡是整顿工作做得好的地区，以现有的粮食销售指标，实事求是地保证对缺粮农民的供应是可能的。据淮阳县一百九十六个村（一四三七八户）统计，由于进行了整顿工作，可减少粮食供应二十六万四千多斤。据林县、内黄等四个县的调查，有百分之四十五的乡可减少供应量。反之，凡是心中无数，盲目向上要粮，不认真检查工作，不认真进行整顿的，就不能解决粮食供应问题。
    指示说，整顿粮食统销工作要结合生产进行。要充分发动群众，向农民交代国家对缺粮农民保证供应的办法。要作好党、团员的思想发动工作，发动他们在提高认识的基础上，进行自我检查。据淮阳县扩大干部会议的统计，参加会议的四百八十二人中领到购粮证的有四百六十二人，经过检查的结果，发现有不该供应和该少供应而多供应的有一百五十三人，在保证供应的情况下，他们共可以退出多余的粮食两万两千多斤。指示在最后说，在整顿粮食统销工作中，还应该把国家粮食市场恢复起来，因为有些农民目前还有余粮待售。
    据新华社武汉二十九日电　中共湖北省委四月十五日发出大力整顿农村粮食统销工作的紧急指示。指示说，做好整顿粮食统销工作，是当前整个农村工作的主要环节之一。指示要求各级党委加强领导，根据地区不同情况，结合工作中心，依靠党支部、乡干部，依靠群众把整顿工作深入到乡，深入到农业生产合作社和互助组以至农户。在工作中首先要从思想上武装区乡干部，坚定他们做好当前粮食供应工作的信心。在群众中继续深入宣传贯彻
  “三定”政策及当前粮食供应政策，讲清保证缺粮户的粮食供应，解除某些群众的怀疑和误解，做到够吃户和余粮户不买粮食，号召群众节约粮食，动员群众以多种多样的方法生产渡荒，提倡种菜和夏种作物，并宣布群众所节约的粮食在一个乡范围内可互借互换，以调剂粮食余缺和有无，并允许到国家粮食市场出售。
    据新华社济南二十九日电　中共山东省委四月十八日发出指示，要求各级党委把整顿粮食统销工作作为当前稳定群众生产情绪，保证春耕生产的一项极为重要的政治和经济措施。指示列举事实说明了粮食供应紧张的真正原因。梁山、郓城、钜野、曹县等地七个乡又五个村整顿统销工作的结果表明，应发购粮证而未发购粮证的二百四十三户，但不应发购粮证或应少供应而多供应的有六百二十户，经向这些农民进行说服教育以后，他们自动交回购粮证或减少购粮量的共有四十七万五千斤。因此，指示要求在整顿工作中，首先使干部认识到不该供应而供应和该少供应而多供应是粮食供应紧张的真正原因。指示号召干部以身作则，深入群众，实事求是地解决粮食供应问题。指示说，这一工作必须在中共乡支部领导下进行。在粮食销售指标下达到乡后，召开乡人民代表大会会议加以公布，并经过调查研究，讨论供应原则和供应对象。指示最后说，要加强对国家粮食市场的领导，并要向农民宣布一九五四年粮食统购已经结束，凡农民有多余粮食和需要调换粮种的，可到国家粮食市场出售或进行农民之间的有无调剂。
