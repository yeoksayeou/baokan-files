    Establishing Regular Inspection Work
    Since November 1954, the CPC Shanghai Yulin District Committee has paid attention to conducting in-depth inspection work in the party's grassroots organizations. This inspection work has gradually become a regular task. However, according to the recent inspection by the Yulin District Committee, there are still many problems in this work. For example, some people regard inspection work as a means of summarizing work and collecting materials; others are afraid that going deeper will lead to problems they cannot solve, affecting their prestige. Due to the excessive number of meetings of the District Committee and various departments, responsible cadres do not have sufficient time to go deep into grassroots organizations to conduct work. Furthermore, the cadres sent down to conduct inspection work lack key personnel, so the inspection work cannot achieve the desired results.
    In order to change this situation, the Yulin District Committee decided to combine this work with the District Committee's regular deployment and summary work. Before formulating a work plan, the District Committee will send inspection teams to go deep into grassroots organizations to understand the situation, and formulate a practical and feasible plan based on the information gathered. After the District Committee's various work deployments are issued, responsible cadres will immediately lead inspection teams to go deep into grassroots organizations to discover problems and propose solutions. The inspection teams should specifically help grassroots organizations summarize work, help grassroots cadres change their style, improve their work, and consolidate the ties between the Party organization and the people.

    建立经常的检查工作
    中共上海市榆林区委从一九五四年十一月起，注意深入党的基层组织检查工作。这种检查工作现已逐步成为经常性的工作。但据榆林区委最近的检查，这一工作中还是存在着很多问题。例如有人把检查工作看成是总结工作和收集材料的手段；也有人怕深入下去后，解决不了问题，影响自己威信。由于区委和各部门的会议太多，负责干部没有充分时间深入基层组织进行工作。派下去检查工作的干部中还缺乏骨干，以致检查工作还不能收到应有的效果。
    为了改变这种状况，榆林区委决定把这一工作和区委的经常部署和总结工作结合起来。区委在制定工作计划之前，要派检查组深入基层组织了解情况，根据所了解的情况制定出切实可行的计划。区委的各项工作部署下去以后，要立即由负责干部带领检查组深入基层组织，发现问题，提出解决问题的办法。检查组要具体帮助基层组织总结工作，帮助基层干部改变作风，改进工作，巩固党组织和人民群众的联系。　（潘祖康）
