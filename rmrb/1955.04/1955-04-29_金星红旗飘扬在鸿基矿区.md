    The Red Flag with Golden Stars Flies Over the Hon Gai Mining Area
    By Our Correspondent in Vietnam, Zhan Chao
    The Hon Gai coal mining area, Vietnam's largest fuel industrial center and one of the concentrations of the Vietnamese working class, was completely liberated on April 24.
    This famous coal mining area is located east of Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The mining area stretches along the northern coast of the Gulf of Tonkin from Mo Xi in Dong Trieu of Hai Duong Province to Guai Piao Island in Mang Yang of Quang Yen Province, a length of 120 kilometers. Here lies the world's highest quality anthracite coal. According to old materials, some say the coal reserves in the Hon Gai mining area are over 200 million tons, and some say at least 1 billion tons. Although there are no accurate survey figures to base this on, it is certain that the reserves are very rich. In many places, coal seams are exposed on the surface, even forming coal mountains. The eleven mines that have already been exploited are mostly open-pit mines.
    The Hon Gai coal mining area is backed by jungles and faces the sea, possessing superior natural geographical conditions. Highway 18 runs through the center of the mining area, closely connecting this fuel industry base with the capital Hanoi and other provinces in North Vietnam. In the central and eastern parts of the mining area, there are two seaports – Hon Gai Port and Cua Ong Port (Cam Pha Port) – which can accommodate ships of up to 10,000 tons. About 40 to 50 kilometers southwest of the mining area is Hai Phong, the largest commercial port in northern Vietnam. Transportation is very convenient.
    The French colonialists, Japanese fascists, and American imperialists were all very enthusiastic about such a mining area. As soon as the French colonialists invaded Vietnam, they sent people to explore the mining area. In 1886, the "French Mining Company of North Vietnam" was established with Hon Gai as its center, and mining began in 1888. It has been more than 60 years since then, but the colonialists have done very little to develop the mining area, and most of the equipment is concentrated on transportation. As long as they could intensify the exploitation of Vietnamese workers and get as much coal as possible, the colonialists were not interested in other issues. The coal mines were overexploited, and production was always in a very backward state, with a maximum annual output of only 2 million tons. It is said that the "French Mining Company of North Vietnam" only had 170 beds in its hospital, but its special agency for reconnaissance, arrest, and imprisonment of workers was very large, employing several hundred people.
    The Hon Gai coal mining area concentrated nearly 20,000 workers. The Hon Gai workers have a glorious history in the Vietnamese national democratic revolution, playing a leading role in many struggles. When the nationwide war of resistance broke out in 1946, the Hon Gai workers organized an independent armed force. This team of coal miners, gloriously named after Ho Chi Minh, made outstanding contributions in the early battles to defend the mining area and in other battles in northern Vietnam. In 1952, the workers of the Hon Gai mining area received the highest award from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, collectively winning the Military Service Medal.
    According to the Geneva Accords, the area around Hai Phong, including the Hon Gai coal mining area, was designated as a temporary stationing area for French troops for a period of 300 days. In those days of anticipation of liberation, the coal miners and people of Hon Gai lived in anxiety and excitement. The workers organized themselves to carry out a mine protection struggle, trying everything possible to prevent French troops and American stooge Ngo Dinh Diem's elements from looting large and small parts of the mining area. The workers also united to launch struggles against layoffs and against the looting of goods, preventing the French colonialists from arbitrarily dismissing workers and forcing workers and people to move south.
    The day of liberation finally arrived. In accordance with the agreement signed by the Vietnamese and French delegations to the Ceasefire Commission, the Vietnamese People's Army began to take over the eastern section of the mining area on April 22 and the western section on April 24. With the arrival of the Vietnamese People's Army, the red flag with golden stars blossomed like flowers throughout the mining area.
    In many places, the solemn and beautiful five-star red flag and the red flag with golden stars were proudly displayed side by side, fluttering in the sea breeze. Those were the residences of overseas Chinese. There are more than 70,000 people in the entire mining area, about 15,000 of whom are overseas Chinese, many of whom are coal miners and their families. People have formed deep friendships in their common labor, and today they are rejoicing together to welcome liberation.
    These countless red flags, large and small, and colorful archways appeared like miracles in every newly liberated area, filling people with endless excitement. When the French troops and the Ngo Dinh Diem puppet army were still there, people spent countless nights secretly cutting and sewing the red and yellow cloth they had bought or dyed, according to patterns that had been passed down from who knows where, and which were very accurate, into these beloved flags, and hiding them in very hidden places. As soon as the French troops left, the doors of all the houses in that area were opened, and people flocked to the streets, and for a moment the streets, fields, and bays were full of flags. Some families, even behind the temporary cordon lines set up by the French troops as they withdrew in sections, could not help but put up their flags.
    At 10:00 a.m. on April 24, a red flag with a golden star suddenly rose on the Shi Ge Mountain in the southeast of Hon Gai city. That was what two coal miners had quietly prepared the night before. This flag heralded the imminent complete liberation of the Hon Gai coal mining area, ushering in a completely new page in history. From then on, the rich Hon Gai coal mining area would forever belong to the Vietnamese people.
    These days, the workers and other working people of the Hon Gai mining area are truly unspeakably happy. The Hon Gai coal miners, with their glorious revolutionary traditions, are working hard to restore production with high enthusiasm. On the day of liberation, the workers of Cua Ong Port worked as usual, transporting coal from the ore dressing plant to the wharf in trucks, and then using cranes to unload the coal onto the ships waiting to be transported.
    The Cam Pha mine, which accounts for 70 percent of the total output of the entire mining area, has also rapidly resumed production. The workers vowed to use new production achievements to welcome the first "May Day" International Labor Day after liberation.

    金星红旗飘扬在鸿基矿区
    本报驻越南记者　展潮
    越南最大的燃料工业中心、越南工人阶级集中地之一的鸿基煤矿区，在四月二十四日全部解放了。
    这个著名的煤矿区，就在越南民主共和国首都河内的东面。矿区沿着东京湾的北岸自西向东延伸，从海阳省东潮的莫溪直到广安省孟阳的拐瓢岛，长一百二十公里，在这里，蕴藏着世界上最优质的无烟煤。据旧有的材料，有的说鸿基矿区煤藏量在二亿吨以上，有的说至少有十亿吨。虽然没有精确的勘探数字可作根据，但蕴藏量十分丰富是确定了的。许多地方煤层都暴露在地面上，甚至形成一座座煤山。已经开采的十一处矿场，绝大部分是露天的。
    鸿基煤矿区北靠丛林、南临大海，具备着优越的自然地理条件。横贯矿区的中心是十八号公路，它使这个燃料工业地和首都河内以及北越各省紧密地连接起来。在矿区的中部和东部，有两个海港——鸿基港和宫门港（锦普港），可以停泊上万吨的轮船，离矿区西南四、五十公里的地方，是越南北部第一大商港——海防。交通运输十分方便。
    对于这样的矿区，法国殖民者、日本法西斯和美帝国主义都非常热衷。法国殖民者刚一侵入越南，就派人到矿区勘探。一八八六年，以鸿基为中心设立了“北越法国矿产公司”，一八八八年便着手开采。到现在已经六十多年了，殖民者对于矿区的建设却微乎其微，而且多数设备都集中在交通运输方面。只要能够加紧压榨越南工人，尽可能多地把煤炭拿到手里，对于其他问题，殖民者都是不感兴趣的。煤矿被滥加开采，生产始终处在很落后的状态中，年产量最高只能达到二百万吨。据说“北越法国矿产公司”所属医院只有一百七十个病床，但是它专设的侦察、拘捕和监禁工人的机构却很庞大，在里面供职的总有几百人。
    鸿基煤矿区集中了将近两万名工人。鸿基工人在越南民族民主革命中有着光辉的历史，在许多次斗争中起着带头作用。一九四六年全国抗战爆发的时候，鸿基工人组织了一支独立的武装，这支以光荣的胡志明命名的煤矿工人的队伍，在初期矿区保卫战以及后来越北其他战役中建立了卓越的战功。一九五二年，鸿基矿区工人得到民主共和国政府最高的奖赏，集体荣获了军功勋章。
    按照日内瓦协议的规定，海防周围包括鸿基煤矿区在内，作为法国军队临时驻扎地段，为期三百天。在那些期待着解放的日子里，鸿基的煤矿工人和人民，是在焦灼而又兴奋中生活的。工人们有组织地展开了护矿斗争，想尽各种办法阻止法国军队和美国走狗吴庭艳分子劫运矿区里的大小机件。工人们还团结起来展开反解雇、反劫运的斗争，不许法国殖民者随便辞退工人以及强迫工人和人民南迁。
    解放的日子终于到来了。越南人民军按照停战委员会越、法双方代表团签订的协议，四月二十二日开始接管矿区的东段，二十四日接管矿区的西段。随着越南人民军的到来，金星红旗像鲜花似地开遍了整个矿区。
    有许多地方，庄严、美丽的五星红旗和金星红旗高高地并列在一起，迎着海风忽忽飘荡。那是华侨的住宅。整个矿区共有七万多人，华侨约有一万五千人，其中有许多是煤矿工人和他们的家属。人们在共同的劳动中结下了深厚的情谊，今天为着迎接解放而一起欢欣鼓舞。
    这些数不清的大大小小的红旗和多彩的牌楼，像奇迹一样地刹那之间在刚解放的每一个地段里出现，使人看了感到无限兴奋。当法国军队和吴庭艳伪军还在的时候，人们不知花了多少个夜晚，把买回来或者染成的红布和黄布，按照着不知从那里传来的而又十分准确的图样，偷偷地剪裁和缝制成这些心爱的旗子，并把它们藏在很隐蔽的地方。只要法国军队一离开，那个地段里所有的房子的大门就开开，人们拥到街上来，一时满街遍野以及港湾里都是旗子。有些还在法国军队分段撤离，临时布置的警戒线后面的人家，甚至也情不自禁地把旗子挂起来了。
    二十四日上午十时，鸿基市区东南的诗歌山上，突然升起了一面金星红旗。那是两个煤矿工人头一天晚上就悄悄地准备好了的。这面旗子，预告着鸿基煤矿区即将全部解放，在历史上揭开了完全新的一页。从此，富饶的鸿基煤矿区就要永远属于越南人民了。
    这些天来，鸿基矿区的工人们和其他劳动人民，真有说不出的高兴。有着光荣的革命传统的鸿基煤矿工人，更以高度的积极性努力恢复生产。在解放的当天，宫门港的工人就照常工作，从选矿厂里把一车车煤炭运到码头上，然后用起重机把煤炭卸到待运的轮船上去。
    出煤占全矿区总产量百分之七十的锦普矿，也已经迅速地恢复了生产。工人们宣誓说：要用新的生产成绩来迎接解放后的第一个“五一”国际劳动节。
