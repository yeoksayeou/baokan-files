    Celebrating the Achievements of the Asian-African Conference

    With the strong support of the Asian-African people and peace-loving countries and people all over the world, and thanks to the joint efforts of the vast majority of delegations to seek common ground while reserving differences, the Asian-African Conference, which is of concern to the whole world, has finally overcome obstacles and sabotage, and has achieved important successes both inside and outside the conference. This is a victory for the forces of international peace.

    The Asian-African Conference Joint Communiqué shows that the conference has reached agreements on issues of common interest to Asian-African countries, particularly on major issues such as the people of dependent countries, the promotion of world peace and cooperation, human rights and self-determination, and economic and cultural cooperation. The conference also adopted a declaration on promoting world peace and cooperation. The achievements of the conference reflect the tremendous changes taking place in the Asian-African region, and reflect the common aspirations of the Asian-African people to safeguard world peace, strive for and maintain national independence, and promote friendly cooperation among countries. Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out at the closing session: "The achievements of the conference are the beginning or enhancement of understanding between Asian and African countries, and the reaching of agreements on certain major issues. This will greatly help us in our common tasks of opposing colonialism, upholding world peace, and enhancing friendly cooperation with each other. This conference has substantially satisfied the aspirations of the Asian and African people and the people of the world." The Chinese people celebrate the achievements of the Asian-African Conference and are willing to work together with the Asian-African people to realize the various agreements of the conference.

    The Asian-African Conference's declaration on promoting world peace and cooperation expresses deep concern about the current international tensions. The Asian-African people have suffered serious damage from two world wars. Now, the international aggressive forces headed by the United States are, on the one hand, trying their best to maintain and expand colonial rule, not allowing the vast people of the Asian-African region to have national independence and freedom, and threatening in various ways the people who have freely chosen their own political and economic systems and ways of life, in an attempt to undermine their free choice; on the other hand, it organizes opposing military blocs, clamoring for and preparing for atomic war. These aggressive activities of the United States are the root cause of tensions in Asia, Africa, and the international situation. However, the Asian-African people love peace and are determined to defend it. They cannot allow the Asian-African region to become a breeding ground for a new war. The declaration of the Asian-African Conference reflects this demand of the people to a considerable extent. The ten principles revealed in the conference declaration are basically in line with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The conference expressed its support for the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of the production, testing, and use of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, demanded that all countries live together peacefully and cooperate in a friendly manner, and demanded that all international disputes be resolved peacefully. This is very important. Obviously, the common efforts of Asian-African countries to maintain peace will not only help ease tensions in the Asian-African region, but will also have a major influence on the world situation.

    As the declaration of the Asian-African Conference points out: "Freedom and peace are interdependent, the right to self-determination must be enjoyed by the people of all countries, and freedom and independence must be granted as soon as possible without delay to the people who are still in dependent countries." Striving for and maintaining national independence and completely ending colonial rule remains a serious struggle for the Asian-African people today. Through the persistent efforts of some countries in the Asian-African region, the United Nations General Assembly has in the past made various resolutions in line with the United Nations Charter on issues such as West Irian, Tunisia, Morocco, racial discrimination in South Africa, and issues related to human rights and the right to national self-determination. However, these resolutions have not been implemented. In many colonies, blood is still flowing. The atrocities of racism continue. The basic human rights and the right to self-determination of many nations are being scorned. The poverty, backwardness, and disasters caused by colonial rule have only increased. The Asian-African people absolutely cannot tolerate this situation continuing to exist. The Chinese people support the Asian-African Conference's condemnation of colonialism and related resolutions. West Irian and Goa must be returned to their original owners. Yemen's legitimate position on the issue of Aden and southern Yemen should be satisfied. Colonial rule in North Africa must end. Racial discrimination and persecution in South Africa must stop. The rights of the Arab people of Palestine should be respected, and the Palestinian issue should be resolved peacefully under the principle of the people resolving disputes themselves.

    In order to oppose colonialism, strive for and maintain national independence, and defend peace, the Asian-African people must cooperate in a friendly manner. Cooperation among Asian-African countries in political, economic, and cultural fields will not only help the development of independent economies in various countries, but also help promote mutual friendly relations. The Asian-African Conference has put forward positive proposals and methods for realizing this cooperation. We have favorable conditions for developing trade and economic cooperation on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for national sovereignty, and for expanding cultural exchanges between countries. The state of exploitation and control of backward Eastern countries by Western colonial powers must be changed, and the destruction of national cultures of many Asian-African countries by colonial rule must also be stopped. Asian-African countries must develop their own independent and autonomous economies and develop national cultures, while also destroying the iron curtain hung by the United States between countries. Only in this way can the true development of the economies and cultures of various countries be brought about.

    During the Asian-African Conference, representatives of various countries expressed concern about the tense situation in the Taiwan area and made some contacts. The United States has tried to distort the truth and use the tense situation in the Taiwan area that it has created to create disputes and poison the atmosphere of the Asian-African Conference. However, this attempt by the United States has failed. From Premier Zhou Enlai's solemn statement, kind people all over the world understand: "The Chinese people are friendly to the American people. The Chinese people do not want to fight the United States. The Chinese government is willing to sit down with the United States government to negotiate and discuss the issue of easing tensions in the Far East, especially the issue of easing tensions in the Taiwan area." Liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair and does not allow foreign interference. The tense situation caused by US interference is an international issue, and therefore it is necessary to directly negotiate with the United States. This peaceful desire of the Chinese people does not affect the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan in the slightest. Premier Zhou Enlai's statement was widely welcomed and supported by the countries at the conference. However, the US State Department hurriedly issued a statement, putting forward unreasonable preconditions to evade the issue. US Senate Republican leader Knowland even openly said that Premier Zhou Enlai's statement "does not conform to established US policy." This means that other countries must sacrifice their own territory and sovereignty to "conform" to US aggressive policy. From here, is it not very clear who wants to ease tensions and who wants to maintain the tense situation?

    Many countries at the Asian-African Conference also expressed great concern about the situation in Indochina. The contacts they made have had a positive effect on consolidating peace in Indochina. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Laos issued a joint statement, stating that they will develop good-neighborly relations between the two countries in accordance with the Five Principles. The Chinese people believe that the Geneva Agreement on restoring peace in Indochina should be guaranteed to be fully implemented by all parties concerned. At the same time, the peaceful reunification of Korea should also be quickly sought through consultations among all parties concerned. These are urgently needed to maintain peace in this region and the world.

    The Asian-African Conference was organized by twenty-nine countries with different systems and different ideologies. Some of these countries have established diplomatic relations or are friendly to each other, while others have no relations at all, or there are still estrangements. Some countries met for the first time at this conference. However, the conference reached common views on some major issues. Representatives of various countries also made extensive contacts to promote mutual understanding. This is a major victory for the spirit of consultation in seeking common ground while reserving differences. This proves that there is a common foundation between our Asian and African countries, and proves that holding such a conference is beneficial. Even if there are differences between us, and there are still some estrangements caused by external factors, as long as we conduct consultations in the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences, we can contribute to maintaining peace and promoting friendly cooperation. In this conference, the efforts of the Colombo Conference countries, especially the delegations of India, Indonesia, and Burma, to uphold the principles of the Bogor Conference were an important factor in the success of the conference. Egypt and many other countries also played a constructive role. The delegation of our country, headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, consistently adhered to the purpose of the conference from beginning to end, insisted on seeking common ground while reserving differences, made unremitting efforts to strive for the success of the conference, and won universal praise. It should be pointed out here that some individual countries in the conference have tried to provoke disputes and cause opposition. However, this effort that violated the purpose of the conference still failed, which shows that the people's desire for cooperation and peace cannot be ignored.

    The Chinese people welcome the Asian-African Conference's proposal on convening the next conference. We believe that the results achieved by the Asian-African Conference both inside and outside the conference, starting from the spirit of seeking common ground, are an example for exploring common problems in other regions of the world. Since Asian and African countries can conduct such consultations and reach common opinions on major issues, then, similarly, the many major issues in Europe that affect international security should also be able to seek solutions through common efforts in the spirit of seeking common ground. Peace-loving people all over the world see that the Soviet Union is constantly making such efforts. People are expecting Western countries to do the same.

    The United States is hostile to the efforts of Asian and African countries to strive for and maintain independence, maintain peace, and promote friendly cooperation. It knows very well that if Asian and African countries can maintain independence and autonomy and cooperate in a friendly manner, then the United States will not be able to monopolize and control this region, enslave the people of this region, and seek high profits for monopoly capital; if all Asian and African countries want peace, the US plan to prepare for war will be greatly hit. In order to sabotage the conference, the United States used various methods and channels to carry out activities before and during the conference. It even directed Chiang Kai-shek's special agents to use assassination methods against staff members of our delegation in Hong Kong. It sent the so-called largest "delegation" to Bandung, attempting to manipulate the meeting from outside the venue. It wholeheartedly believed that it would not work if the Asian-African Conference was not at its disposal. However, it miscalculated after all. It did not see that the forces of international peace are greater than the forces of international war. It did not calculate that the firm will of the Asian-African people to defend peace and oppose war is what really played a role at the conference.

    The Chinese delegation, headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, faithfully implemented the consistent foreign policy of maintaining world peace and promoting international cooperation, and successfully completed the important tasks entrusted to them by the Chinese people. The Chinese people express their heartfelt condolences and support for the great efforts of our delegation. The Chinese people are willing to continue to establish and expand mutual contacts, and enhance mutual understanding and cooperation with Asian-African countries and any other countries in the world on the principle of peaceful coexistence. Facts have once again proved that we do not have bamboo curtains, and we are working hard to break the iron curtain hung on us by the United States. The door of China is open. The Chinese people welcome all people who are willing to understand each other to visit our country at any time. We believe that this will definitely be good for peace in Asia and the world.

### 庆贺亚非会议的成就

    庆贺亚非会议的成就
    全世界关心的亚非会议在亚非人民和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的有力支持下，由于绝大多数国家的代表团求同存异的共同努力，终于克服了阻挠和破坏，在会内和会外都获得了重要的成就。这是国际和平力量的一个胜利。
    亚非会议联合公报表明，会议已就亚非国家有共同利害关系的问题，特别是关于附属国人民，促进世界和平和合作，人权和自决，经济、文化合作等主要问题，取得了协议。会议还通过了促进世界和平和合作的宣言。会议的成就反映了亚非地区所发生的巨大变化，反映了亚非人民保障世界和平、争取和维护民族独立和促进各国友好合作的共同愿望。周恩来总理在闭幕大会上指出：“会议的成就是开始了、或者增进了亚非各国之间的了解，并在某些主要问题上达成了协议，这对于我们在反对殖民主义、拥护世界和平、增进彼此之间友好合作的共同任务上将有很大帮助。这个会议相当地满足了亚非人民和世界人民的愿望。”中国人民庆贺亚非会议的成就，并愿同亚非人民一起为实现会议各项协议而共同努力。
    亚非会议关于促进世界和平和合作的宣言，对目前国际紧张局势表示深切的关怀。亚非人民曾经遭到两次世界大战的严重损害。现在，以美国为首的国际侵略势力又在一方面竭力想保持和扩大殖民主义统治，不许亚非地区广大人民有民族独立和自由，对于已经自由选择了自己的政治、经济制度和生活方式的人民，多方加以威胁，企图破坏他们的自由选择；另一方面它又组织对立的军事集团，叫嚣和准备原子战争。美国的这些侵略活动是亚非两洲和国际局势紧张的根源。但是，亚非人民是爱好和平，也有决心保卫和平的。他们不能容许亚非地区成为新战争的策源地。亚非会议的宣言相当地反映了人民的这种要求。会议宣言所揭示的十项原则基本上符合于和平共处的五项原则。会议表示支持裁减军备和禁止生产、试验和使用核子和热核子作战武器，要求各国彼此和平相处，友好合作，要求一切国际纠纷应以和平方式解决。这是十分重要的。很显然，亚非国家共同维护和平的努力，不但将有利于和缓亚非地区局势的紧张，同时它对世界局势也会发生重大的影响。
    正如亚非会议的宣言所指出的：“自由和和平是相互依靠的，自决的权利必须为一切国家的人民所享有，自由和独立必须尽可能不予拖延地给予现在仍旧是附属国人民的人们。”争取和维护民族独立、完全结束殖民主义统治，这仍然是今天亚非人民的严重斗争。在亚非地区有些国家的坚持努力下，过去联合国大会曾对西伊里安、突尼斯、摩洛哥、南非种族歧视等问题以及有关人权和民族自决权问题，作出了符合联合国宪章的各项决议。但是，这些决议没有付诸实施。在许多殖民地，血仍然在流着。种族主义的暴行还在继续。许多民族的基本人权和自决权利，受到蔑视。殖民统治所造成的贫穷、落后和灾难有加无已。亚非人民是绝对不能容忍这种情况继续存在下去的。中国人民支持亚非会议对殖民主义的谴责和有关决议。西伊里安、果阿必须归还原主。也门在亚丁和也门南部地区问题上的正当立场应该予以满足。在北非的殖民统治必须结束。南非的种族歧视和迫害必须停止。巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人民的权利应该受到尊重，巴勒斯坦问题应该在人民自行解决争端的原则下和平解决。
    为了反对殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立，保卫和平，亚非人民必须友好合作。亚非各国在政治、经济和文化方面的合作，将不仅有助于各国独立经济的发展，而且有助于促进相互的友好关系。亚非会议提出了实现这种合作的积极主张和办法。我们之间具备着有利的条件，在平等互利和互相尊重国家主权的基础上发展贸易往来和经济合作，扩大各国之间的文化交流。西方殖民国家对东方落后国家的剥削和控制状态必须改变，殖民统治对许多亚非国家的民族文化的摧残也必须停止。亚非国家要发展自己的独立自主的经济，发展民族的文化，同时也要毁掉美国在各国之间挂下的铁幕。只有这样，才有可能带来各国的经济和文化的真正发展。
    在亚非会议期间，各国代表对台湾地区的紧张局势表示关怀，并进行了一些接触。美国曾经企图歪曲事实真相，利用它所造成的台湾地区紧张局势，来制造纷争，毒化亚非会议的气氛。但是，美国的这种企图是失败了。从周恩来总理的郑重声明中，全世界善良人民懂得：“中国人民同美国人民是友好的。中国人民不要同美国打仗。中国政府愿意同美国政府坐下来谈判，讨论和缓远东紧张局势的问题，特别是和缓台湾地区的紧张局势问题。”解放台湾是中国的内政，决不容许外来干涉。由于美国的干涉而引起的紧张局势，则是国际问题，因此，有必要同美国直接商谈。中国人民的这种和平愿望，丝毫不影响中国人民解放台湾的斗争。周恩来总理的声明，得到了会议各国的普遍欢迎和支持。但是，美国国务院却赶忙发表声明，提出无理的先决条件来搪塞。美国参议院共和党领袖诺兰甚至公然说，周恩来总理的声明“不符合美国的既定政策”。这就是说要别的国家牺牲自己的领土与主权，去“符合”美国的侵略政策。从这里看，到底是谁要和缓紧张局势，是谁要保持局势的紧张，难道不是非常清楚吗？
    亚非会议许多国家对印度支那局势也表示十分关切。它们进行的接触，对巩固印度支那和平产生了积极的作用。越南民主共和国和老挝发表了联合声明，表示将根据五项原则发展两国的睦邻关系。中国人民认为，恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦协议应该得到有关各方保证其完全执行。同时，朝鲜的和平统一也应该经过有关各方的协商，迅速地谋求解决。这都是维护这一地区和世界和平所迫切需要的。
    亚非会议是由二十九个不同制度、不同思想意识的国家组织起来的。这些国家间有的是建立了外交关系或者是互相友好的，有的却是什么关系也没有，或者还存在着隔阂的。有些国家在这个会议上还是初次见面。但是会议却在一些主要的问题上得到了共同的看法。各国代表还作了广泛的接触，促进了相互之间的了解。这是求同存异的协商精神的重大胜利。这证明我们亚非国家之间有着共同的基础，证明举行这样的会议是有益处的。即使我们之间是有分歧的，并且还存在着外来的因素所造成的一些隔阂，但是只要本着求同存异的精神进行协商，我们能够为维护和平和促进友好合作作出贡献。在这一次会议中，科伦坡会议国家、特别是印度、印度尼西亚和缅甸代表团坚持茂物会议的原则的努力，是使会议得到成就的重要因素。埃及和其他许多国家也起了建设性的作用。我国以周恩来总理为首的代表团自始至终坚持会议的目的，坚持求同存异，对争取会议成功，作了不懈的努力，并博得了普遍的赞扬。在这里应该指出，会议中有个别国家，却曾经努力挑起争端，引起对立。但这种违反会议目的的努力仍然失败了，这说明主张合作、要求和平的人民愿望是不容忽视的。
    中国人民欢迎亚非会议关于召开下届会议问题的建议。我们认为，亚非会议从求同精神出发而在会内会外所得到的成果，对于在世界上其他地区探讨共同问题是一个范例。亚洲和非洲国家之间既然可以进行这样的协商，对主要问题取得共同意见；那末，同样，目前欧洲存在的许多影响国际安全的重大问题，也应该能够本着求同的精神，共同努力，谋求解决。全世界爱好和平人民看到苏联不断地在这样努力。人们都期待着西方国家也这样做。
    美国仇视亚非各国争取和维护独立、维护和平、促进友好合作的努力。它很清楚地知道，如果亚非国家都能够保持独立自主，友好合作，那末，美国就不能对这个地区进行垄断控制，奴役这个地区的人民，来谋取垄断资本的高额利润；如果亚非各国都要和平，美国准备战争的计划就要受到巨大打击。为了破坏会议，美国在会前会中曾经用了各种方法通过了各种途径来进行活动。它甚至指挥蒋匪特务分子在香港对我国代表团工作人员实行谋杀手段。它派遣所谓最大的“代表团”到万隆去，企图从会外操纵会场。它一心以为亚非会议不受它的摆布是不行的。但是，它毕竟是失算了。它没有看到国际和平力量大于国际战争势力。它没有计算到，亚非人民保卫和平、反对战争的坚决意志才是在会议上真正起作用的东西。
    以周恩来总理为首的中国代表团忠实地执行了维护世界和平和促进国际合作的一贯的外交政策，胜利地完成了中国人民委托给他们的重大任务。中国人民对我国代表团重大的努力表示衷心的慰问和支持。中国人民愿意在和平相处的原则上继续同亚非国家和全世界其他任何国家建立和扩大相互的联系，增进相互的了解和合作。事实再次证明，我们没有竹幕，我们正在努力打破美国对我们挂下的铁幕。中国的大门是开着的。中国人民欢迎一切愿意相互了解的人们随便什么时候来我国访问。我们相信，这对亚洲和世界和平一定会有好处。
