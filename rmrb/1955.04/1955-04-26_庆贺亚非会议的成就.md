    Celebrating the Achievements of the Asian-African Conference

    With the strong support of the Asian-African people and peace-loving countries and people all over the world, and thanks to the joint efforts of the vast majority of delegations to seek common ground while reserving differences, the Asian-African Conference, which is of concern to the whole world, has finally overcome obstacles and sabotage, and has achieved important successes both inside and outside the conference. This is a victory for the forces of international peace.

    The Asian-African Conference Joint Communiqu√© shows that the conference has reached agreements on issues of common interest to Asian-African countries, particularly on major issues such as the people of dependent countries, the promotion of world peace and cooperation, human rights and self-determination, and economic and cultural cooperation. The conference also adopted a declaration on promoting world peace and cooperation. The achievements of the conference reflect the tremendous changes taking place in the Asian-African region, and reflect the common aspirations of the Asian-African people to safeguard world peace, strive for and maintain national independence, and promote friendly cooperation among countries. Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out at the closing session: "The achievements of the conference are the beginning or enhancement of understanding between Asian and African countries, and the reaching of agreements on certain major issues. This will greatly help us in our common tasks of opposing colonialism, upholding world peace, and enhancing friendly cooperation with each other. This conference has substantially satisfied the aspirations of the Asian and African people and the people of the world." The Chinese people celebrate the achievements of the Asian-African Conference and are willing to work together with the Asian-African people to realize the various agreements of the conference.

    The Asian-African Conference's declaration on promoting world peace and cooperation expresses deep concern about the current international tensions. The Asian-African people have suffered serious damage from two world wars. Now, the international aggressive forces headed by the United States are, on the one hand, trying their best to maintain and expand colonial rule, not allowing the vast people of the Asian-African region to have national independence and freedom, and threatening in various ways the people who have freely chosen their own political and economic systems and ways of life, in an attempt to undermine their free choice; on the other hand, it organizes opposing military blocs, clamoring for and preparing for atomic war. These aggressive activities of the United States are the root cause of tensions in Asia, Africa, and the international situation. However, the Asian-African people love peace and are determined to defend it. They cannot allow the Asian-African region to become a breeding ground for a new war. The declaration of the Asian-African Conference reflects this demand of the people to a considerable extent. The ten principles revealed in the conference declaration are basically in line with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The conference expressed its support for the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of the production, testing, and use of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, demanded that all countries live together peacefully and cooperate in a friendly manner, and demanded that all international disputes be resolved peacefully. This is very important. Obviously, the common efforts of Asian-African countries to maintain peace will not only help ease tensions in the Asian-African region, but will also have a major influence on the world situation.

    As the declaration of the Asian-African Conference points out: "Freedom and peace are interdependent, the right to self-determination must be enjoyed by the people of all countries, and freedom and independence must be granted as soon as possible without delay to the people who are still in dependent countries." Striving for and maintaining national independence and completely ending colonial rule remains a serious struggle for the Asian-African people today. Through the persistent efforts of some countries in the Asian-African region, the United Nations General Assembly has in the past made various resolutions in line with the United Nations Charter on issues such as West Irian, Tunisia, Morocco, racial discrimination in South Africa, and issues related to human rights and the right to national self-determination. However, these resolutions have not been implemented. In many colonies, blood is still flowing. The atrocities of racism continue. The basic human rights and the right to self-determination of many nations are being scorned. The poverty, backwardness, and disasters caused by colonial rule have only increased. The Asian-African people absolutely cannot tolerate this situation continuing to exist. The Chinese people support the Asian-African Conference's condemnation of colonialism and related resolutions. West Irian and Goa must be returned to their original owners. Yemen's legitimate position on the issue of Aden and southern Yemen should be satisfied. Colonial rule in North Africa must end. Racial discrimination and persecution in South Africa must stop. The rights of the Arab people of Palestine should be respected, and the Palestinian issue should be resolved peacefully under the principle of the people resolving disputes themselves.

    In order to oppose colonialism, strive for and maintain national independence, and defend peace, the Asian-African people must cooperate in a friendly manner. Cooperation among Asian-African countries in political, economic, and cultural fields will not only help the development of independent economies in various countries, but also help promote mutual friendly relations. The Asian-African Conference has put forward positive proposals and methods for realizing this cooperation. We have favorable conditions for developing trade and economic cooperation on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for national sovereignty, and for expanding cultural exchanges between countries. The state of exploitation and control of backward Eastern countries by Western colonial powers must be changed, and the destruction of national cultures of many Asian-African countries by colonial rule must also be stopped. Asian-African countries must develop their own independent and autonomous economies and develop national cultures, while also destroying the iron curtain hung by the United States between countries. Only in this way can the true development of the economies and cultures of various countries be brought about.

    During the Asian-African Conference, representatives of various countries expressed concern about the tense situation in the Taiwan area and made some contacts. The United States has tried to distort the truth and use the tense situation in the Taiwan area that it has created to create disputes and poison the atmosphere of the Asian-African Conference. However, this attempt by the United States has failed. From Premier Zhou Enlai's solemn statement, kind people all over the world understand: "The Chinese people are friendly to the American people. The Chinese people do not want to fight the United States. The Chinese government is willing to sit down with the United States government to negotiate and discuss the issue of easing tensions in the Far East, especially the issue of easing tensions in the Taiwan area." Liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair and does not allow foreign interference. The tense situation caused by US interference is an international issue, and therefore it is necessary to directly negotiate with the United States. This peaceful desire of the Chinese people does not affect the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan in the slightest. Premier Zhou Enlai's statement was widely welcomed and supported by the countries at the conference. However, the US State Department hurriedly issued a statement, putting forward unreasonable preconditions to evade the issue. US Senate Republican leader Knowland even openly said that Premier Zhou Enlai's statement "does not conform to established US policy." This means that other countries must sacrifice their own territory and sovereignty to "conform" to US aggressive policy. From here, is it not very clear who wants to ease tensions and who wants to maintain the tense situation?

    Many countries at the Asian-African Conference also expressed great concern about the situation in Indochina. The contacts they made have had a positive effect on consolidating peace in Indochina. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Laos issued a joint statement, stating that they will develop good-neighborly relations between the two countries in accordance with the Five Principles. The Chinese people believe that the Geneva Agreement on restoring peace in Indochina should be guaranteed to be fully implemented by all parties concerned. At the same time, the peaceful reunification of Korea should also be quickly sought through consultations among all parties concerned. These are urgently needed to maintain peace in this region and the world.

    The Asian-African Conference was organized by twenty-nine countries with different systems and different ideologies. Some of these countries have established diplomatic relations or are friendly to each other, while others have no relations at all, or there are still estrangements. Some countries met for the first time at this conference. However, the conference reached common views on some major issues. Representatives of various countries also made extensive contacts to promote mutual understanding. This is a major victory for the spirit of consultation in seeking common ground while reserving differences. This proves that there is a common foundation between our Asian and African countries, and proves that holding such a conference is beneficial. Even if there are differences between us, and there are still some estrangements caused by external factors, as long as we conduct consultations in the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences, we can contribute to maintaining peace and promoting friendly cooperation. In this conference, the efforts of the Colombo Conference countries, especially the delegations of India, Indonesia, and Burma, to uphold the principles of the Bogor Conference were an important factor in the success of the conference. Egypt and many other countries also played a constructive role. The delegation of our country, headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, consistently adhered to the purpose of the conference from beginning to end, insisted on seeking common ground while reserving differences, made unremitting efforts to strive for the success of the conference, and won universal praise. It should be pointed out here that some individual countries in the conference have tried to provoke disputes and cause opposition. However, this effort that violated the purpose of the conference still failed, which shows that the people's desire for cooperation and peace cannot be ignored.

    The Chinese people welcome the Asian-African Conference's proposal on convening the next conference. We believe that the results achieved by the Asian-African Conference both inside and outside the conference, starting from the spirit of seeking common ground, are an example for exploring common problems in other regions of the world. Since Asian and African countries can conduct such consultations and reach common opinions on major issues, then, similarly, the many major issues in Europe that affect international security should also be able to seek solutions through common efforts in the spirit of seeking common ground. Peace-loving people all over the world see that the Soviet Union is constantly making such efforts. People are expecting Western countries to do the same.

    The United States is hostile to the efforts of Asian and African countries to strive for and maintain independence, maintain peace, and promote friendly cooperation. It knows very well that if Asian and African countries can maintain independence and autonomy and cooperate in a friendly manner, then the United States will not be able to monopolize and control this region, enslave the people of this region, and seek high profits for monopoly capital; if all Asian and African countries want peace, the US plan to prepare for war will be greatly hit. In order to sabotage the conference, the United States used various methods and channels to carry out activities before and during the conference. It even directed Chiang Kai-shek's special agents to use assassination methods against staff members of our delegation in Hong Kong. It sent the so-called largest "delegation" to Bandung, attempting to manipulate the meeting from outside the venue. It wholeheartedly believed that it would not work if the Asian-African Conference was not at its disposal. However, it miscalculated after all. It did not see that the forces of international peace are greater than the forces of international war. It did not calculate that the firm will of the Asian-African people to defend peace and oppose war is what really played a role at the conference.

    The Chinese delegation, headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, faithfully implemented the consistent foreign policy of maintaining world peace and promoting international cooperation, and successfully completed the important tasks entrusted to them by the Chinese people. The Chinese people express their heartfelt condolences and support for the great efforts of our delegation. The Chinese people are willing to continue to establish and expand mutual contacts, and enhance mutual understanding and cooperation with Asian-African countries and any other countries in the world on the principle of peaceful coexistence. Facts have once again proved that we do not have bamboo curtains, and we are working hard to break the iron curtain hung on us by the United States. The door of China is open. The Chinese people welcome all people who are willing to understand each other to visit our country at any time. We believe that this will definitely be good for peace in Asia and the world.
