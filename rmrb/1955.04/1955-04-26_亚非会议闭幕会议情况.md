Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, April 25th. The Asian-African Conference held its closing session at 18:30 Java time on April 24th at the "Independence Hall" in Bandung. After unanimously passing the joint communiqué amidst prolonged and thunderous applause and cheers, representatives from various countries delivered speeches.

Sardar Mohammed Naim Khan, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Afghanistan, spoke first. He said that we came to participate in this conference with great hope, and I am very happy to say that we are leaving here with even greater hope. He said: The conference proved that although the participating countries come from different regions of Asia and Africa, they have reached a consensus in order to promote better understanding, safeguard peace, and protect human rights.

He said: "This contribution, based on cooperation in a large part of the world and supported by the majority of the world's people, undoubtedly deserves to be regarded as having historical significance."

Burmese Prime Minister U Nu said that it is not surprising that we could not make epoch-making decisions. No such expectation was ever made. The purpose of the conference was to bring the leaders of Asian and African countries together to exchange views in order to gain a better understanding. We have done this. Prime Minister U Nu said, "Our discussions revealed differences and disagreements in opinions, but this was to be expected given the vast geographical area constituted by the countries attending the conference. In this contentious world surrounded by suspicion and misunderstanding, even a slight understanding in any of its regions must be considered progress." Prime Minister U Nu said, "It goes without saying that the conference sometimes fell into what seemed to be a stalemate, but the soundness, patience, perseverance, and skillful techniques shown by the distinguished representatives enabled us to find a way out of this situation and seek a basis for consensus. In this sense, this conference is a concrete manifestation of peaceful coexistence."

Premier Zhou Enlai, the chief representative of the Chinese delegation, then spoke.

Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser said: "Our conference has achieved great success because the unity and harmony demonstrated in the decisions made at our conference will greatly contribute to international peace and cooperation. The deep concern and full support shown by all Asian and African countries for human rights and self-determination will greatly inspire the cause of freedom." Nasser said that the patience and spirit of reconciliation of the delegations helped our discussions avoid disagreements and embark on a friendly and constructive path.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru said that the representatives attending the conference came from afar to gather together, discuss with each other to solve our common problems, and thus make friends with each other. He said that although the participating countries came here with their own views and with their own problems, their problems could not be solved if peace itself was in danger and this situation was ignored. He said, "So our main consideration is peace."

Prime Minister Nehru said that this conference is a new chapter in the history of Asia and Africa. He said that Asia and Africa have fallen behind in the world competition. Now we must catch up. We are determined not to be dominated in any way by any other country or any other continent. We are determined to stand up again with our heads held high. We should bring happiness and prosperity to our people, and get rid of all the shackles that have bound us for many years, not only politically but also economically.

Prime Minister Nehru said, "Asia is no longer passive today; it is no longer a humble Asia; it has tolerated the status of humility for too long. Today's Asia is dynamic; Asia is full of vitality."

Referring to the resolutions reached at the conference, Prime Minister Nehru said that the representatives had had differences, but in the end, they reached a consensus. This is the main thing. This is the great achievement of our conference.

Prime Minister Nehru finally said: "We have had some glorious history, and we must meet the world's expectations of us."

Indonesian representative, Foreign Minister Sunarjo, spoke. He said that some people had expected the Asian-African Conference to become a battlefield where various irreconcilable views would clash, and that it would end in failure. He said, "But that was not the case, and the conference achieved great success."

Sunarjo emphasized the great significance of the West Irian issue to his country. He expressed his gratitude for the full support given to Indonesia by the conference. He said, "The final settlement of the dispute with the Netherlands on this issue will ease tensions in this part of the world and contribute to world peace and international cooperation."

Sunarjo emphasized the need to make efforts to avoid war. He said, "Because in a peaceful environment, we can prescribe the pace at which we accomplish our great task of building our country, developing our abundant natural resources, and adapting ourselves to the needs of science, technology, and industry, which are the pillars of modern progress." He said, "In doing so, we will make a great contribution to the peaceful and constructive progress of mankind and to the civilization of the world."

Referring to the treaty on dual nationality signed between Indonesia and China, Sunarjo said that this treaty was "signed by two Asian countries in a spirit of goodwill and tolerance, which has always guided the Asian-African Conference itself."

Iranian representative Ali Amini said: The consistency shown here demonstrates the "common ideal of striving for peace and friendship." The consensus reached at the meeting is gratifying.

Iraqi representative Fadil Jamali said: Everyone has differences in opinion, but the important thing is that everyone gathers together to discuss and put forward our points of agreement and take action on these issues. Jamali pointed out that the conference had reached agreement on a wide range of issues, and he said: "This conference will go down in history as a major world event."

Japanese representative Takasaki Tatsunosuke pointed out that the conference had achieved remarkable success and made a beneficial contribution to enhancing the friendship and understanding between the people of Asia and Africa. He said, "We are greatly encouraged by the broad agreement we have reached on our common problems." He said, "This conference has unfolded a new stage in world history. In fact, it has brought the long-awaited dawn of the revival of Asia and Africa."

Lao representative Ket Sasorith said that his delegation "fully supports the important resolutions reached at the conference." He said, "I hope that all those who are truly concerned about peace will regard the observance of these principles and regulations as a moral obligation." He said: "We very much hope that similar meetings will be convened as often as possible, in an atmosphere that has been created and properly defined, it is possible to promote mutual understanding and contribute to peaceful coexistence and collective security."

Lebanese representative Sami Solh said that his delegation had expressed the hope at the opening meeting that the work carried out could achieve gratifying results, and that the issue of specific cooperation between the peoples of Asian and African countries should be resolved on the basis of justice and common interests. He said that this wish has now been realized.

Liberian representative Momolu Dukuly said that the Asian-African Conference is a great historical event in world history. The countries of the two continents gathered together not to plot war and exploitation but to promote understanding and world peace.

Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Ali said that the Asian-African Conference was a memorable conference. He said: "Although we have different attitudes towards world issues, our interests are different, and our policies are inconsistent, we are still able to reach a consensus on a statement that expresses our attitude towards the problems facing the world today, and I should say that this is very valuable."

Philippine representative Carlos Romulo said that he hoped that "history will say that although we did not provide a plan to build a perfect world, we did lay the foundation for generating hope," but he expressed doubt as to whether this meant "achievement".

Sudanese representative Ismail al-Azhari said: We have successfully found solutions to our various problems. Many of us have become more understanding of each other, and before that, almost none of us had enough understanding of each other's countries and people. If we can maintain these friendly relations established here, we will have gone a long way in achieving our future success.

He said: The success achieved is only the beginning. "I am confident that our future steps will be more steady and more effective. Therefore, I warmly hope that we will be able to participate in the meetings held after this conference again."

Syrian representative Ahmed Chokairy said that this conference is the beginning of a practical and moral force. This force will be used to serve peace and to build a free world on the basis of justice and democracy. We have a responsibility to eliminate all fortresses of slavery and imperialism on the planet. We will not stand on the side of aggression. In the past, we were forced to wage wars, kill our own people, and destroy our own countries, but all this was done against our will. But today, we will never agree to be led to a war against our will.

The Syrian representative pointed out that the resolution on convening our next meeting is of great significance.

Turkish representative Fatin Rüştü Zorlu said that if we think about the many problems facing us, and if we think about the different views that exist on many important issues, I believe we must think that the conference has very successfully accomplished its purpose and made a great contribution to all mankind. Zorlu then defended the fact that some countries participated in Western military blocs.

Vietnamese Democratic Republic representative Pham Van Dong said, "Through the exchange of views, contact, reconciliation, and goodwill, mutual understanding and friendship between our countries have been enhanced." Pham Van Dong said, "During the conference, I was deeply saddened by the sight of Vietnam not yet unified. But this is only a temporary situation. According to the provisions of the Geneva Accords, the dividing line between the north and the south is only temporary. The current situation is only a stage that must lead to the reunification of Vietnam through free and democratic elections. Therefore, all the people of Vietnam, regardless of north and south, are determined to do everything in their power to strive for this unity and to consolidate peace. These two tasks are closely linked to each other." Pham Van Dong emphasized the importance of the Geneva Accords and reiterated the determination of the Vietnamese people and government to "thoroughly and faithfully implement the Geneva Accords in order to consolidate peace, achieve unity, and complete the independence of Vietnam," "In this struggle, we truly rely on the support of the people of Asian countries."

Nguyen Van Thuy, representative of the State of Vietnam, also spoke at the meeting.

After the above representatives had spoken, the chairman of the meeting, Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo, delivered a closing speech.

Sastroamidjojo said: "When we met at the first meeting on April 18, many of us did not know each other. We came from various parts of the two continents of Asia and Africa for a basic purpose, and this basic purpose, as put forward in the memorandum of the five sponsoring countries, was to allow everyone to better understand each other's opinions. We have in our hearts the hope that this understanding will lead to more results, some valuable results that will benefit not only the people of Asia and Africa but also the entire world." He then said: Now, at the end of the same week, we have shown that the people of Asia and Africa advocate peace. In front of us and in front of the whole world is the joint communiqué that we unanimously adopted a few minutes ago.

Sastroamidjojo said: "In this way, our gathering is not just a simple meeting, but has produced more and better things. We have achieved mutual understanding in an atmosphere of sincerity and frankness. Although we look at our common goals from different angles, we are finally convinced that we ourselves are capable of making valuable contributions to world peace. If I call our joint communiqué a document of historical significance, it is because we can expect our opinions to be valued not only by our two continents but also by the whole world."

Sastroamidjojo said: "I sincerely hope that when the rest of the world pays due attention to our resolutions, they will also demonstrate the same admirable spirit of goodwill, tolerance, restraint, and wisdom that our conference has demonstrated."

Sastroamidjojo emphasized: "The people of Asia and Africa have shown that we are capable of cooperating, and what we need is peace, overriding peace, for the benefit of our people and the whole world. During our gathering, we have gained a lot for ourselves and even for millions upon millions of others."

Sastroamidjojo finally said: "During these days, many friendships have been established and many beneficial contacts have been made. Now we ourselves know that we need to practice tolerance and live together in peace like friendly neighbors, and this is the only reliable and true foundation on which mankind can prosper. May we continue to move forward on the path we have jointly taken, and may the Bandung Conference become a beacon guiding the progressive future of Asia and Africa."

The closing meeting ended at 21:30.

When the representatives left the "Independence Hall", they were warmly cheered by thousands of people who stood in front of the meeting hall for several hours in spite of the rainy weather, waiting for the victorious conclusion of the meeting. (Attached photo)

    亚非会议闭幕会议情况
    新华社万隆二十五日电　亚非会议四月二十四日爪哇时间十八时三十分在万隆“独立厅”举行闭幕会议。会议在长时间的、暴风雨般的鼓掌声和欢呼声中一致通过了联合公报以后，接着由各国代表发言。
    阿富汗副首相兼外交大臣萨达尔·穆罕默德·纳伊姆汗首先发言。他说，我们怀着很大的希望来参加这个会议，我很高兴地说，我们怀着更大的希望离开这里。他说：会议证明，虽然与会国家来自亚非两洲的不同地区，但是为了促进更好的了解、维护和平和保障人权，会议得出了一致的意见。
    他说：“这种建立在世界一大部分地区合作的基础上的、得到世界大多数人民支持的贡献，无疑地配得上人们认为它具有的历史意义。”
    缅甸总理吴努说，虽然我们不能作出划时代的决定。这是不足为奇的。并没有作过这种期望。会议的目的是使亚非国家的领袖们聚集一堂交换意见，以便更好的了解。这点我们已做到了。吴努总理说“我们的讨论显露出意见的不同和分歧，但是就出席会议的国家所构成的地理上的广大地区而论，这一点是早已意料到的。在这个为猜疑和误解所包围的纷争的世界上，在它的任一地区取得些微的谅解，都必须认为是个进步。”吴努总理说：“无庸讳言，会议有时陷入看来似乎是僵持的局面，但是，各位卓越的代表所表现的稳健、忍耐、坚韧和熟练的技巧，使我们得以找到脱离这种局面的途径和寻求一致的基础。从这个意义上讲，这次会议正是和平共处的具体表现。”
    中国代表团首席代表周恩来总理接着发言。
  （见本报二十五日第一版）
    埃及总理纳赛尔发言说：“我们的会议已经取得了巨大的成就。因为在我们的会议作出的决定中所表现出的团结和和谐将大大有助于国际和平和合作。所有亚非国家表现出的对人权和自决问题的深切关怀和充分支持将大大地鼓舞自由事业。”纳赛尔说，各代表团的忍耐与和解的精神帮助我们的讨论避免分歧而走上友好和建设性的道路。
    印度总理尼赫鲁发言说，参加会议的代表们从很远的地方到这里来聚会在一起，彼此进行讨论以解决我们的共同问题，从而彼此交朋友。他说，虽然与会国家是抱着它们自己的看法和带着它们自己的问题来这里的，但是如果和平本身是在危险中而且这种情况被弃置不顾的话，它们的问题是不可能获得解决的。他说，“所以我们主要的考虑便是和平。”
    尼赫鲁总理说，这个会议是亚非历史上的新的一章。他说，亚洲和非洲在世界的竞赛中是落在后面了。现在我们必须迎头赶上。我们决心不受任何其他国家或任何其他洲的任何方式的支配。我们有决心挺起胸膛再度站起来。我们应该为我们的人民带来幸福和繁荣，摆脱多年来不仅在政治上束缚着我们、而且在经济上束缚着我们的一切桎梏。
    尼赫鲁总理说，“亚洲今天不再是被动的了，它已经不再是一个卑躬屈节的亚洲了；它对卑躬屈膝的地位已经容忍得很久了。今天的亚洲是有活力的；亚洲是充满了生气的。”
    尼赫鲁总理在提到会议所达成的决议时说，代表们曾经有过分歧，但最后，他们取得一致意见了。这是主要的事情。这是我们会议的伟大成就。
    尼赫鲁总理最后说：“我们有过一些辉煌的历史，我们必须满足全世界对我们的希望。”
    印度尼西亚代表、外交部长苏纳约发言。他说，有些人曾经期望亚非会议将成为各种不可调和的观点发生冲突的战场，这样它就将以失败而告终。他说，“但是，并没有这样，会议取得了很大的成就。”
    苏纳约着重指出西伊里安问题对他的国家的重大的意义。他对会议给予印度尼西亚的充分支持表示感激。他说，“同荷兰最后解决关于这个问题的纠纷，必将缓和世界这一部分地区的紧张局势，并且有助于世界和平和国际合作。”
    苏纳约强调必须努力避免战争。他说，“因为在和平的环境中，我们能够规定我们实现我们巨大任务的步调，来建设我们的国家，开发我们的丰富的自然资源，使我们自己适应于作为现代进步支柱的科学、技术和工业方面的需要。”他说，“这样做，我们将对人类和平的和建设性的进步以及世界的文明有很大的贡献”。
    苏纳约在谈到印度尼西亚同中国签订的关于双重国籍问题的条约时说，这项条约是“两个亚洲国家本着善意和容忍的精神签订的，这种精神一直指导着亚非会议本身”。
    伊朗代表阿里·阿米尼说：这里的表现的一致性表明了“争取和平和友谊的共同理想”。会议达成了一致的协议，是值得高兴的。
    伊拉克代表法迪尔·贾马利说：大家在意见上是有分歧的，可是重要的东西是大家聚集在一起讨论和提出我们的同意之点并且就这些问题采取行动。贾马利指出会议已经在广泛问题上达成协议，他说：“这个会议将作为一件世界大事列入史册。”
    日本代表高碕达之助指出，会议取得了出色的成就，它对增进亚非两洲人民的友谊和了解作出了有利的贡献。他说，“我们由于在我们的共同问题上取得的广泛协议感到莫大的鼓舞”。他说，“这个会议展开了世界史上的新的阶段。事实上，它带来了等待已久的亚非两洲复兴的黎明。”
    老挝代表克特·萨索里斯说，他的代表团“完全支持在会议上达成的重要决议”。他说，“我希望所有真正关心和平的人都认为遵守这些原则和规定当是一种道义上的义务。”他说：“我们非常希望尽可能经常地召开类似的会议，在这种一旦创造和适当地确定起来了的气氛中，是可能促进相互谅解以及对和平共处和集体安全作出贡献的。”
    黎巴嫩代表萨米·索勒哈说，他的代表团曾在开幕会议上表示希望所进行的工作能得到可喜的结果，并且亚非国家人民之间具体合作的问题应该根据正义和共同的利益加以解决。他说，这种愿望现在已经实现。
    利比里亚代表摩莫卢·杜库利说，亚非会议是世界历史上的一个伟大的历史事件，两个洲的国家聚集在一起不是为了策划战争和剥削而是为了促进了解和世界和平。
    巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里说，亚非会议是一个令人难忘的会议。他说：“尽管我们各自对待世界问题的态度不同，我们的利害关系不同，政策不一致，但是我们仍然能够就表明我们对待今天世界面临的问题的态度的声明达成一致协议，我应当说这是十分可贵的。”
    菲律宾代表卡洛斯·罗慕洛说，他希望“历史会说，虽然我们没有提供建立一个十全十美的世界的计划，但是我们的确规定了产生希望的基础”，但是他又表示怀疑这是否就意味着“成就”。
    苏丹代表伊斯梅尔·阿扎里说：我们已经成功地为我们的各种问题找到了解决办法。我们中间许多人都变得彼此更为了解了，而在此以前我们中间差不多没有什么人对彼此的国家和人民有足够的了解。如果我们能够把这里所建立的这些友好关系保持下去的话，我们就是在取得我们将来的成功方面走了很远。
    他说：已经获得的成功仅仅是开始。“我确信我们以后的步骤将更稳当和更有成效。因此我热烈希望我们将能够参加这个会议以后再次举行的会议。”
    叙利亚代表艾哈迈德·乔卡列发言说，这个会议是一个实际的和道义的力量的开端。这种力量将被用来为和平、为在正义和民主的基础上建立一个自由的世界服务。我们有责任来消灭在地球上的奴役和帝国主义的一切堡垒。我们将不站在侵略的那一边。在过去，我们曾被迫进行战争，杀死我们自己的人，毁坏我们自己的国家，但这一切却是违背了我们的意志进行的。可是在今天，我们决不答应在违背我们的意志的情况下被导向一个战争。
    叙利亚代表指出，关于召开我们的下届会议的决议是具有重大的意义的。
    土耳其代表法丁·吕斯图·佐鲁说，如果我们想一想摆在我们面前的许多问题，如果我们想一想在许多重要问题上存在着不同的看法，我相信我们必须认为会议已经非常成功地完成了它的目的，并对全体人类作出了巨大的贡献。佐鲁接着又为某些国家参加西方军事集团的事实辩解。
    越南民主共和国代表范文同说，“通过交换意见、接触、和解的态度和善意，我们各国之间的相互了解和友谊已经增进。”范文同说，“在会议过程中，我对越南尚未统一的景象深感痛心。但是，这只是暂时的局面。根据日内瓦协定的规定，北部和南部之间的分界线只是临时性的。目前的局势只是一个必须导向通过自由和民主的选举来重新实现越南统一的阶段。因此，越南全体人民不分南北，都决心竭尽全力为争取这种统一，争取巩固和平而斗争。这两个任务是紧密地互相连系起来的。”范文同强调指出了日内瓦协定的重要性，并重申越南人民和政府决心“彻底地忠实地贯彻日内瓦协定，以巩固和平，取得统一和完成越南的独立”，“在这个斗争中，我们确实依靠亚洲各国人民的支持。”
    越南国代表阮文瑞也在会上发了言。
    在上述代表们发言完毕后，会议主席、印度尼西亚总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约致闭幕词。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约说：“当四月十八日我们在第一次会议上会见的时候，我们中间很多人还是彼此不相识的。我们从亚非两大洲的各个地方来，是为了一个基本目的，这个基本目的，正如五个发起国的备忘录中所提出的，是为了让大家更好地了解彼此的意见。我们的心中怀着这样的希望：这种了解会得到更多的结果，得到一些不但对亚非人民有利的、而且对全世界都有利的、有价值的结果。”他接着说：现在在同一个星期的周末，我们已经表明，亚非人民主张和平。在我们的面前以及全世界的面前，放着我们在几分钟以前一致通过的联合公报。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约说：“这样一来，我们的聚会就不只是一个单纯的会议，而是产生了更多和更好的一些东西。我们在诚恳和坦率的气氛中取得了相互的了解。虽然我们从不同的角度来看我们的共同目的，我们终于相信我们自己是有能力对世界和平作出有价值的贡献的。如果我把我们的联合公报称为一个具有历史意义的文件的话，这是因为我们可以期望我们的意见不单受到我们两洲的重视，而且还受到全世界的重视。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约说：“我十分虔诚地希望，当世界其余地区对我们的决议加以适当的注意的时候，他们也将表现我们这次会议所表现的同样令人钦佩的具有善意、容忍、节制和智慧的精神。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约强调说：“亚非人民已经表明，我们是能够合作的，而我们所需要的是和平，压倒一切的、为了我们的人民和全世界的利益的和平。在我们聚会的期间，我们为我们自己以至为其他千千万万的人已经取得很多的收获。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约最后说：“在这些日子里，许多友谊已经建立，许多有益的接触已经进行。现在我们自己当中都知道，我们需要实行容忍和彼此像友好的邻居一样地在和平中一起生活，而这是人类赖以昌盛的唯一可靠的、真实的基础。愿我们在我们已经共同采取的道路上继续前进，并愿万隆会议成为指引亚洲和非洲的进步前途的灯塔。”
    闭幕会议在二十一时三十分结束。
    当代表们离开会场“独立厅”时，受到数千群众的热烈欢呼，他们不顾雨天在会议厅门前站了几小时等待会议的胜利闭幕。（附图片）
