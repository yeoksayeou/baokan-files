Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, April 25th. The Asian-African Conference held its closing session at 18:30 Java time on April 24th at the "Independence Hall" in Bandung. After unanimously passing the joint communiqu√© amidst prolonged and thunderous applause and cheers, representatives from various countries delivered speeches.

Sardar Mohammed Naim Khan, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Afghanistan, spoke first. He said that we came to participate in this conference with great hope, and I am very happy to say that we are leaving here with even greater hope. He said: The conference proved that although the participating countries come from different regions of Asia and Africa, they have reached a consensus in order to promote better understanding, safeguard peace, and protect human rights.

He said: "This contribution, based on cooperation in a large part of the world and supported by the majority of the world's people, undoubtedly deserves to be regarded as having historical significance."

Burmese Prime Minister U Nu said that it is not surprising that we could not make epoch-making decisions. No such expectation was ever made. The purpose of the conference was to bring the leaders of Asian and African countries together to exchange views in order to gain a better understanding. We have done this. Prime Minister U Nu said, "Our discussions revealed differences and disagreements in opinions, but this was to be expected given the vast geographical area constituted by the countries attending the conference. In this contentious world surrounded by suspicion and misunderstanding, even a slight understanding in any of its regions must be considered progress." Prime Minister U Nu said, "It goes without saying that the conference sometimes fell into what seemed to be a stalemate, but the soundness, patience, perseverance, and skillful techniques shown by the distinguished representatives enabled us to find a way out of this situation and seek a basis for consensus. In this sense, this conference is a concrete manifestation of peaceful coexistence."

Premier Zhou Enlai, the chief representative of the Chinese delegation, then spoke.

Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser said: "Our conference has achieved great success because the unity and harmony demonstrated in the decisions made at our conference will greatly contribute to international peace and cooperation. The deep concern and full support shown by all Asian and African countries for human rights and self-determination will greatly inspire the cause of freedom." Nasser said that the patience and spirit of reconciliation of the delegations helped our discussions avoid disagreements and embark on a friendly and constructive path.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru said that the representatives attending the conference came from afar to gather together, discuss with each other to solve our common problems, and thus make friends with each other. He said that although the participating countries came here with their own views and with their own problems, their problems could not be solved if peace itself was in danger and this situation was ignored. He said, "So our main consideration is peace."

Prime Minister Nehru said that this conference is a new chapter in the history of Asia and Africa. He said that Asia and Africa have fallen behind in the world competition. Now we must catch up. We are determined not to be dominated in any way by any other country or any other continent. We are determined to stand up again with our heads held high. We should bring happiness and prosperity to our people, and get rid of all the shackles that have bound us for many years, not only politically but also economically.

Prime Minister Nehru said, "Asia is no longer passive today; it is no longer a humble Asia; it has tolerated the status of humility for too long. Today's Asia is dynamic; Asia is full of vitality."

Referring to the resolutions reached at the conference, Prime Minister Nehru said that the representatives had had differences, but in the end, they reached a consensus. This is the main thing. This is the great achievement of our conference.

Prime Minister Nehru finally said: "We have had some glorious history, and we must meet the world's expectations of us."

Indonesian representative, Foreign Minister Sunarjo, spoke. He said that some people had expected the Asian-African Conference to become a battlefield where various irreconcilable views would clash, and that it would end in failure. He said, "But that was not the case, and the conference achieved great success."

Sunarjo emphasized the great significance of the West Irian issue to his country. He expressed his gratitude for the full support given to Indonesia by the conference. He said, "The final settlement of the dispute with the Netherlands on this issue will ease tensions in this part of the world and contribute to world peace and international cooperation."

Sunarjo emphasized the need to make efforts to avoid war. He said, "Because in a peaceful environment, we can prescribe the pace at which we accomplish our great task of building our country, developing our abundant natural resources, and adapting ourselves to the needs of science, technology, and industry, which are the pillars of modern progress." He said, "In doing so, we will make a great contribution to the peaceful and constructive progress of mankind and to the civilization of the world."

Referring to the treaty on dual nationality signed between Indonesia and China, Sunarjo said that this treaty was "signed by two Asian countries in a spirit of goodwill and tolerance, which has always guided the Asian-African Conference itself."

Iranian representative Ali Amini said: The consistency shown here demonstrates the "common ideal of striving for peace and friendship." The consensus reached at the meeting is gratifying.

Iraqi representative Fadil Jamali said: Everyone has differences in opinion, but the important thing is that everyone gathers together to discuss and put forward our points of agreement and take action on these issues. Jamali pointed out that the conference had reached agreement on a wide range of issues, and he said: "This conference will go down in history as a major world event."

Japanese representative Takasaki Tatsunosuke pointed out that the conference had achieved remarkable success and made a beneficial contribution to enhancing the friendship and understanding between the people of Asia and Africa. He said, "We are greatly encouraged by the broad agreement we have reached on our common problems." He said, "This conference has unfolded a new stage in world history. In fact, it has brought the long-awaited dawn of the revival of Asia and Africa."

Lao representative Ket Sasorith said that his delegation "fully supports the important resolutions reached at the conference." He said, "I hope that all those who are truly concerned about peace will regard the observance of these principles and regulations as a moral obligation." He said: "We very much hope that similar meetings will be convened as often as possible, in an atmosphere that has been created and properly defined, it is possible to promote mutual understanding and contribute to peaceful coexistence and collective security."

Lebanese representative Sami Solh said that his delegation had expressed the hope at the opening meeting that the work carried out could achieve gratifying results, and that the issue of specific cooperation between the peoples of Asian and African countries should be resolved on the basis of justice and common interests. He said that this wish has now been realized.

Liberian representative Momolu Dukuly said that the Asian-African Conference is a great historical event in world history. The countries of the two continents gathered together not to plot war and exploitation but to promote understanding and world peace.

Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Ali said that the Asian-African Conference was a memorable conference. He said: "Although we have different attitudes towards world issues, our interests are different, and our policies are inconsistent, we are still able to reach a consensus on a statement that expresses our attitude towards the problems facing the world today, and I should say that this is very valuable."

Philippine representative Carlos Romulo said that he hoped that "history will say that although we did not provide a plan to build a perfect world, we did lay the foundation for generating hope," but he expressed doubt as to whether this meant "achievement".

Sudanese representative Ismail al-Azhari said: We have successfully found solutions to our various problems. Many of us have become more understanding of each other, and before that, almost none of us had enough understanding of each other's countries and people. If we can maintain these friendly relations established here, we will have gone a long way in achieving our future success.

He said: The success achieved is only the beginning. "I am confident that our future steps will be more steady and more effective. Therefore, I warmly hope that we will be able to participate in the meetings held after this conference again."

Syrian representative Ahmed Chokairy said that this conference is the beginning of a practical and moral force. This force will be used to serve peace and to build a free world on the basis of justice and democracy. We have a responsibility to eliminate all fortresses of slavery and imperialism on the planet. We will not stand on the side of aggression. In the past, we were forced to wage wars, kill our own people, and destroy our own countries, but all this was done against our will. But today, we will never agree to be led to a war against our will.

The Syrian representative pointed out that the resolution on convening our next meeting is of great significance.

Turkish representative Fatin R√º≈üt√º Zorlu said that if we think about the many problems facing us, and if we think about the different views that exist on many important issues, I believe we must think that the conference has very successfully accomplished its purpose and made a great contribution to all mankind. Zorlu then defended the fact that some countries participated in Western military blocs.

Vietnamese Democratic Republic representative Pham Van Dong said, "Through the exchange of views, contact, reconciliation, and goodwill, mutual understanding and friendship between our countries have been enhanced." Pham Van Dong said, "During the conference, I was deeply saddened by the sight of Vietnam not yet unified. But this is only a temporary situation. According to the provisions of the Geneva Accords, the dividing line between the north and the south is only temporary. The current situation is only a stage that must lead to the reunification of Vietnam through free and democratic elections. Therefore, all the people of Vietnam, regardless of north and south, are determined to do everything in their power to strive for this unity and to consolidate peace. These two tasks are closely linked to each other." Pham Van Dong emphasized the importance of the Geneva Accords and reiterated the determination of the Vietnamese people and government to "thoroughly and faithfully implement the Geneva Accords in order to consolidate peace, achieve unity, and complete the independence of Vietnam," "In this struggle, we truly rely on the support of the people of Asian countries."

Nguyen Van Thuy, representative of the State of Vietnam, also spoke at the meeting.

After the above representatives had spoken, the chairman of the meeting, Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo, delivered a closing speech.

Sastroamidjojo said: "When we met at the first meeting on April 18, many of us did not know each other. We came from various parts of the two continents of Asia and Africa for a basic purpose, and this basic purpose, as put forward in the memorandum of the five sponsoring countries, was to allow everyone to better understand each other's opinions. We have in our hearts the hope that this understanding will lead to more results, some valuable results that will benefit not only the people of Asia and Africa but also the entire world." He then said: Now, at the end of the same week, we have shown that the people of Asia and Africa advocate peace. In front of us and in front of the whole world is the joint communiqu√© that we unanimously adopted a few minutes ago.

Sastroamidjojo said: "In this way, our gathering is not just a simple meeting, but has produced more and better things. We have achieved mutual understanding in an atmosphere of sincerity and frankness. Although we look at our common goals from different angles, we are finally convinced that we ourselves are capable of making valuable contributions to world peace. If I call our joint communiqu√© a document of historical significance, it is because we can expect our opinions to be valued not only by our two continents but also by the whole world."

Sastroamidjojo said: "I sincerely hope that when the rest of the world pays due attention to our resolutions, they will also demonstrate the same admirable spirit of goodwill, tolerance, restraint, and wisdom that our conference has demonstrated."

Sastroamidjojo emphasized: "The people of Asia and Africa have shown that we are capable of cooperating, and what we need is peace, overriding peace, for the benefit of our people and the whole world. During our gathering, we have gained a lot for ourselves and even for millions upon millions of others."

Sastroamidjojo finally said: "During these days, many friendships have been established and many beneficial contacts have been made. Now we ourselves know that we need to practice tolerance and live together in peace like friendly neighbors, and this is the only reliable and true foundation on which mankind can prosper. May we continue to move forward on the path we have jointly taken, and may the Bandung Conference become a beacon guiding the progressive future of Asia and Africa."

The closing meeting ended at 21:30.

When the representatives left the "Independence Hall", they were warmly cheered by thousands of people who stood in front of the meeting hall for several hours in spite of the rainy weather, waiting for the victorious conclusion of the meeting. (Attached photo)
