    Completion of Restoration and Expansion Project of Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area

    (Our Newspaper) This paper reports that the restoration and expansion project of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area has been successfully completed. During the unprecedented massive flood last year, the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area was opened for flood diversion for the first time, successively absorbing 12.5 billion cubic meters of floodwater from the Three Gorges, curbing three peak floods, and playing a significant role in ensuring the safety of the Jingjiang Dike and the industrial city of Wuhan. After the flood diversion, many dike sections were damaged by wind and waves due to the long-term water storage in the diversion area, and many ditches were also silted up; at the same time, it was discovered that the design of the surrounding water dikes in the diversion area was too low. In order to heal the wounds after the flood diversion, further enhance the effectiveness of the diversion area, and ensure agricultural harvest in years without flood diversion, Hubei and Hunan provinces successively mobilized 170,000 laborers to invest in the restoration and expansion project of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area. The entire project includes two major parts: dikes and drainage, totaling more than 9.6 million cubic meters of earthwork. At present, except for the ongoing riprap revetment project on the southern dike of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area, the projects in various places are about to be completed successively, and the laborers are being demobilized in batches.

    The successful completion of the restoration and expansion project of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area will add 40,000 mu of fertile land to the diversion area in normal waterlogging years, and it will further protect the lives and property of millions of people in Hubei and Hunan.

    荆江分洪区恢复扩建工程完工
    本报讯　荆江分洪区恢复扩建工程胜利完工。在去年百年未有的特大洪水期中，荆江分洪区首次开闸分洪，先后消纳了来自三峡的一百二十五亿立公方的洪水，遏止了三次最高洪峰，对确保荆江大堤和武汉工业城市的安全，起了很大的作用。分洪后，由于分洪区长期蓄水，许多堤段被风浪袭击受到了破坏，许多沟渠也被淤塞；同时，发现过去对分洪区围水堤设计偏低。为了医治分洪后的创伤，进一步发挥分洪区的效能，并在不分洪的年份里保证农业丰收，湖北、湖南两省先后动员十七万民工，投入荆江分洪区的恢复和扩建工程。全部工程包括堤防和排水两大部分，合计土方九百六十万多方。目前除正在进行的荆江分洪区南堤块石护坡工程外，各地工程即将陆续完工，民工正分批下堤。
    荆江分洪区恢复扩建工程的胜利完工，在平常渍水年份，将为分洪区增加四万亩良田，它将进一步保卫两湖千百万人民生命财产的安全。
