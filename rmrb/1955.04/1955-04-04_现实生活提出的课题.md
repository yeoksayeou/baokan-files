Issues Raised by Real Life
By our correspondent Wang Xi

The Nemuro region in eastern Hokkaido, Japan, is a world-renowned fishing ground. The fishermen in this region are neighbors with the residents of the Soviet Kuril Islands and Habomai Islands, separated by a strait. The American occupation forces have designated many restricted areas along the Japanese coast – exercise areas, firing ranges, and also a "ill-fated MacArthur Line," prohibiting Japanese fishermen from fishing in coastal fishing areas and on the high seas of the Pacific Ocean. Numerous fishing boats are crowded into the limited sea area nearby. The kelp harvested by the fishermen is getting shorter and shorter, and the crabs caught are also ridiculously small. A small fishing owner named Yoshinobu Matsuura owns a five-ton fishing boat and often employs five workers. Under normal circumstances, his family of four could live well. However, now, he has to worry about the fish hold that cannot be filled.

Three years ago, the residents of the Nemuro region issued a call for "peaceful negotiation to resolve the fishery issue between Japan and the Soviet Union." After the Sino-Soviet joint communique was issued, Japan was shaken. In this remote corner, a movement to demand the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and between Japan and China first unfolded. Yoshinobu Matsuura and his partners drafted a resolution demanding the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and between Japan and China, and submitted it to the local assembly for approval.

From Hokkaido to Kyushu, from the east coast to the west coast, the same voice has been echoing. Many prefectures such as Akita, Yamagata, Niigata, and even Okayama and Shimane face the Soviet Union, China and North Korea across the sea. Like the people in the Nemuro region, they have realized from real life that the severance of trade with neighboring countries has put their lives in increasingly greater difficulties. Coal miners in the Sorachi region of Hokkaido, a famous coal mining area, harbor the hope that establishing diplomatic relations with neighboring countries can improve their economic situation amidst poverty and unemployment. Tofu business owners in the Kansai region demand to buy soybeans from China. Japanese people are accustomed to drinking tofu soup just as our people eat green vegetables and turnips. Member of Parliament Akira Kazami said at a conference in Tokyo: "We are now eating tofu made from American soybeans; if there were Chinese soybeans, tofu would be much cheaper." This is exactly what millions of Japanese housewives often mutter in the kitchen.

Many people in cities, prefectures, and governments far from Tokyo regard the work of preparing to welcome the Chinese trade delegation to Japan as the center of the movement to promote diplomatic relations. The Chinese trade delegation to Japan receives letters and telegrams from various places every day, inviting them to visit the local area. The 550,000 people of Ishikawa Prefecture sent representatives to the "Restoration of Japan-Soviet and Japan-China Diplomatic Relations" conference in Tokyo on March 30, proposing an emergency motion requesting the conference to pass a resolution protesting the Japanese government's actions to prevent the Chinese trade delegation to Japan from visiting.

The people of various regions in Japan have formed various promotion associations according to their own living requirements, and sent various petitions to the Japanese government, such as: "Northern Fisheries Promotion Association," "Offshore Trade Promotion Port Reconstruction Association," "North Kyushu National Relations Restoration Association"... etc. Although there are many names, they all focus on the demand to establish normal relations with neighboring countries. This has promoted the movement to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and between Japan and China to develop into a national movement.

At the end of last October, a national organization – the "National Conference for the Restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations" – was established in Tokyo with the participation of various Japanese political parties and major groups. A person in charge of the "National Conference for the Restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations" told me: The people participating in this movement are more extensive than those participating in previous Japanese peace movements. No matter how different people's political thoughts are, they have all joined this movement. The "Greater Japan Fisheries Association" and the "National Farmers' Union" have never appeared in previous peace movements. Now, they have also joined.

The chairman of the "National Conference for the Restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations," Fusanosuke Kuhara, is over eighty years old and must be helped into a chair to speak. He is a veteran of the Japanese political circles. His voice was clear and definite when he spoke at the Tokyo conference on March 30. He said: "It has been ten years since the end of the war, Japan has not yet been completely independent, foreign troops are still stationed in Japan, and the Japanese economy still relies on foreign aid. This is shameful." This should be the conclusion he drew from his long political life. When he said that he was willing to "contribute his old bones" to promote the restoration of diplomatic relations with neighboring countries, how could people not applaud and congratulate him?

Former Japanese Lieutenant General Saburo Endo said at a gathering in Tokyo: "I have drawn a conclusion from my 40 years of military life experience – peace can only be achieved through negotiation." There are quite a few former Japanese soldiers who participated in the war of aggression, like him, who have begun to awaken and demand peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems.

Japan's outstanding peace fighter, Ikuo Oyama, said: The Japanese people's desire to restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and China cannot be hindered by any force. This 75-year-old man, with his eternally young and passionate words, foreshadowed the prospects for the development of this movement.

    现实生活提出的课题
    本报记者　汪溪
    东京通讯
    日本北海道的东部根室地方是驰名世界的渔场。这个地方的渔民隔一条海峡同苏联千岛群岛和齿舞诸岛的居民为邻。美国占领军在日本沿海划了好多禁区——演习场、打靶场，另外还划定了一条“倒霉的麦克阿瑟线”，不许日本渔民到沿海渔区和太平洋公海上捕鱼。众多的渔船被挤在附近有限的海面上。渔民们采集的海带越来越短，捕到的蟹也小得不像样了。有一个名叫松浦义信的小渔业主，他拥有五吨渔船，经常雇五个工人。按通常情况，他一家四个人是可以过得不错的。但是，现在，他不得不望着那装不满的鱼舱发愁。
      三年以前，根室地方的居民就发出了“和平协商解决日苏间渔业问题”的呼声。中苏两国联合公报发表之后，日本举国震动。就在这个偏僻的角落，首先展开了要求恢复日苏、日中邦交的运动。松浦义信曾经同他的伙伴们一起，草拟了要求恢复日苏、日中邦交的决议书，送到地方议会上通过了。
    从北海道到九州，从东海岸到西海岸的大片土地上，相继响起了同样的声音。像秋田、山形、新潟以至冈山、岛根等许多县都是隔海和苏、中、朝三国相望的地方。人们和根室地方的人一样，从现实生活中认清了：同邻国贸易来往被隔断，使他们生活陷入了越来越大的困难。北海道著名的煤矿区空知地方的煤矿工人，在贫苦和失业里怀着同邻国建立邦交可以使他们经济情况好转的热望。关西地区的豆腐业老板们，要求买到中国的大豆。日本人习惯喝豆腐汤就像我国人吃青菜、萝贝一样。国会议员风见章在东京的一次大会上说：“我们现在吃着美国大豆做的豆腐；如果有中国的大豆，豆腐就会便宜多了。”这正是日本千百万主妇在厨房里经常叨念的话。
    许多远离东京的市、县、府的人民，把准备欢迎中国访日贸易代表团的工作当做促进邦交运动的中心。中国访日贸易代表团每天都接到各地的来信来电，邀请到当地去参观。石川县全县五十五万人派出代表在三月三十日到东京的“恢复日苏、日中邦交”大会上，提出紧急动议，请求大会通过决议，抗议日本政府阻止中国访日贸易代表团前去参观的行动。
    日本各地方的人民，根据自己生活的要求，组成了各种各样的促进会，向日本政府送发了各种请愿书，例如：“北方渔业促进期成会”，“对岸贸易促进港湾复兴会”，“北九州国交恢复会”……等，尽管名目繁多，都集中到同邻国建立正常关系的要求上。这就推动了恢复日苏、日中邦交运动发展成为全国性的运动。
    去年十月底，在东京成立了有日本各政党和主要团体参加的全国性组织——“恢复日中、日苏邦交国民会议”。“恢复日中、日苏国民会议”的一位负责人告诉我说：参加这个运动的人，比参加历次日本的和平运动的人更为广泛。不管人们的政治思想怎样不同，都站到这个运动中来了。“大日本水产会”和“全国农民组合”这两个团体从没有在以前的和平运动中出现过。现在，它们也参加了。
      “恢复日中、日苏邦交国民会议”的主席久原房之助已经年过八十，必须由几个人扶到椅子上坐着讲话，他是日本政界的老前辈。他在三月三十日的东京大会上讲话的声音是清晰的，明确的。他说：“战争结束已经十年，日本还没有完全独立，外国军队还驻在日本，日本经济还靠外国援助，这是丢脸的。”这应该是他自己长期政治生活得出的结论。当他说到：他愿为促进与邻国邦交的恢复而
  “以老骨相献”时，人们怎能不向他鼓掌致贺呢？
    前日本陆军中将远藤三郎在东京的一次集会上说：“我从四十年军人生活的经验中得出了一个结论——只有用协商的方法才能求得和平。”参加过侵略战争的日本旧军人，像他这样开始觉醒过来，要求不同制度的国家和平相处的，不在少数。
    日本杰出的和平战士大山郁夫说：日本人民要求恢复同苏联和中国的邦交的心情是什么力量也不能阻挠的。这位七十五岁高龄的人，他那永远要年轻而充满热情的话，预示了这个运动发展的前景。
