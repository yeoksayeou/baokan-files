In villages that have basically achieved cooperation, is it safe to assume that the spring plowing and sowing plan can be completed smoothly without strengthening concrete leadership? If you have such a view, it is very dangerous.

In Xiaochang Village, Nangong County, Hebei Province, there are four agricultural production cooperatives, with cooperative members accounting for 73 percent of the total number of households. However, judging from the situation before the implementation of the fixed grain production, purchase, and sales system in late March, it was clearly impossible to complete the cotton planting plan. At that time, the members of the cooperative and the masses outside the cooperative in this village generally had these thoughts: they were afraid that planting too much cotton would lead to insufficient grain and hunger; they were afraid that the grain supply would not be timely, and queuing at the grain station would delay production; they were afraid of a lack of livestock fodder. Many people were passive in production, especially unwilling to grow cotton. Many farmers said, "Eat what you grow, grow what is convenient for you." Although it was the busy spring season, there were very few people working in the fields, but many people were sitting idle on the streets, in teahouses, and on street corners. As of March 24, there were still 1,243 mu of spring land uncultivated, 569 mu of wheat unweeded, and no action had been taken on fertilizer accumulation and sowing preparations. Similar situations existed in some other basically cooperative villages.

In order to gain experience in the "three fixings" work (fixed grain production, purchase, and sales), the work team dispatched by the county party committee to Xiaochang Village on March 24 deeply understood the specific situation and carried out many detailed tasks to solve these problems.

Together with the village's party branch, they combined the actual situation in this village and used a concrete accounting method to dispel the masses' ideological concerns: First, they explained the benefits of unified purchase and sales to the farmers in this village and calculated the amount of purchases and unified sales this year. Then, they calculated the increase in grain production. In this way, the farmers had a clear idea and knew that the more the production increased, the more grain could be kept, and that the grain supply was reliably guaranteed. Then, they calculated that planting cotton not only had great benefits, but also that pre-selling 100 jin of ginned cotton could buy an extra 10 jin of grain and 10 chi of cloth. At the same time, they also made it clear that the state supported and cared for the farmers in the cotton-growing areas, explaining that there were shortcomings in the past work, and now they were actively trying to improve the grain supply methods, striving to simplify procedures to make it convenient for farmers to buy grain.

The farmers' ideological concerns were not so easily dispelled. Some people said, "The 'three fixings' are good. Will it really be done like this in the future? I'm afraid that after we plant cotton, it won't be implemented like this." Others said, "The 'three fixings' method is very good, but that is for after July; we don't have grain now, so it's useless! You can't produce on an empty stomach!" "It's not good if the livestock don't have anything to eat!" The work team and the branch made specific studies of these ideas, mobilized party members and members of the Communist Youth League, and further comprehensively publicized the grain policy to the broad masses, explaining the guaranteed supply for those who are truly short of grain. And after mass evaluation, the supply households and the amount of supply were determined. They also used local past facts to guide the farmers to recall the benefits of believing in the government's call and following the Communist Party in the past, so that everyone was convinced that the Communist Party and the People's Government "say where to do, do where to say." After the grain supply problem was solved, they also inspired the masses to think of ways to find grass sources in many ways, overcoming the difficulty of lacking fodder.

After doing this, most of the farmers' concerns were dispelled. Ma Guiqi said: "Chairman Mao is really concerned about us, transferring grain from far away to supply us. Although there are some shortcomings in the supply, it is inevitable because this is a new thing, and everything will be improved step by step." All the members of the four cooperatives in the village unanimously stated: resolutely obey the national planting plan and strive to achieve the task of increasing cotton and grain production. Individual farmers also expressed their response to the call of the state and guaranteed to plant according to the national plan. Du Hengfa said: "Chairman Mao thought really carefully. The 'three fixings' method guarantees the grain supply in our cotton-growing areas. Planting one mu of cotton is equivalent to harvesting three mu of millet. Why not plant more? To be honest, I planted ten mu of cotton last year. This year, I was afraid that there would not be enough grain to eat, and I originally planned to plant seven mu. Now that I know this method, my thinking is clear, and I must plant eleven and a half mu of cotton."

Dispelling ideological concerns that hindered production does not mean that the leaders' work is over; more importantly, it is to lead the masses to do a good job in production to ensure the realization of the increased production plan. Therefore, while the work team and the branch carried out ideological mobilization among the masses and solved problems such as food rations and fodder, they also helped the agricultural production cooperatives to do a good job in production management. They first helped each cooperative revise its annual production plan, studied the arrangements for the current farm work, and then helped each cooperative make a reasonable allocation of labor according to the farm work plan. At the same time, they explained to the members the important significance of completing this year's agricultural increase production plan for the realization of the first five-year plan, improved the socialist consciousness of the members, and led the masses inside and outside the cooperative to carry out labor competitions. In six days, the four cooperatives had cultivated all the uncultivated land and harrowed it twice. In the past, there was no habit of weeding wheat here. Now, in order to strive for increased production, the cooperative mobilized 80 women, who had weeded 350 mu of wheat in four days. Four members drained the accumulated water from two mu of land in one day. There have also been great achievements in fertilizer accumulation. Under the influence of the cooperative, the farmers outside the cooperative have also done a good job in the work of cultivating, harrowing, weeding, and accumulating fertilizer. The individual farmer Du Hengfa had three mu of cotton land that had not been cleared of cotton stalks by the end of March, but now he has cleared and cultivated and harrowed all of it. In order to strive for increased cotton production, farmers inside and outside the cooperative are preparing to select all the cotton seeds once. The village plans to plant 3,860 mu of cotton, reaching 75 percent of the total cultivated land area of the village. The four agricultural production cooperatives plan to increase the yield from 38 jin of ginned cotton per mu last year to 47 jin; the high-yield fields of more than 20 mu are required to produce more than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu; the millet plan is to increase from 250 jin per mu last year to 300 jin. Of the 667 male and female laborers in the village, 422 have been put into spring plowing and production, an increase of more than double compared with before March 24; there are more people in the fields, and there are no idle people in the streets and teahouses.

Look! Before and after March 24, with concrete leadership and without concrete leadership, how big is the difference!

    为了完成播种计划，必须加强具体领导
    李吉平　邵星
    基本上合作化了的村子，不需要加强具体领导，就可以顺利地完成春耕播种计划了吧？如果有这样的看法，那是很危险的。
    河北南宫县孝昌村有四个农业生产合作社，入社农户已达到总农户的百分之七十三。可是，从三月下旬贯彻粮食定产定购定销以前的情况看来，显然是不可能完成棉花种植计划的。那时，这个村的社员和社外群众普遍存在这些思想：怕种棉多了粮食不够吃挨饿；怕粮食供应不及时买粮站队耽误生产；怕缺乏牲口饲草。许多人生产消极，特别是不愿意种棉花。许多农民说：“吃什么，种什么，自己方便。”虽然已是春忙季节，但地里干活的人很少，街上、茶铺、街头却闲坐着不少的人。到三月二十四日为止，全村还有一千二百四十三亩春地没有耕，五百六十九亩麦子没有锄，积肥和播种的准备工作都没有动静。别的一些基本上合作化了的村子，也有同样的情形。
    为了取得“三定”工作的经验，三月二十四日，县委派到孝昌村的工作组，深入地了解了具体情况，细致地进行了许多工作，才把这些问题解决了。
    他们同村子里的党支部在一起，结合这个村子里的实际情况，用具体算账的办法，解除了群众的思想顾虑：首先说明了统购统销带给本村农民的好处，计算了今年征购和统销的数目；接着又算了粮食增产账。这样，农民们都有了底，知道了增产越多确实可以留的粮食越多，知道了粮食供应有了可靠的保证。然后，又计算了种植棉花不但收益大，  而且预售一百斤皮棉可多买十斤粮食、十尺布。同时，还讲清楚了国家对棉区农民的支持和关怀，说明过去工作有缺点，现在正积极设法改进粮食供应办法，力求简化手续，使农民买粮方便。
    农民的思想顾虑不是那末容易打消的。有些人说：“三定倒是好。以后是不是真按这样办？恐怕叫咱种上棉花以后又不按这样执行了。”也有人说：“三定办法很好，那是七月以后的事；现在没有粮食也不沾呀！饿着肚子也不能生产呀！”“牲口没吃的也不行呀！”工作组和支部对这些思想作了具体研究，动员党员、团员，向广大群众进一步全面地宣传了粮食政策，说明对真正缺粮的保证供应。并且经群众评定，确定了供应户和供应数目。他们还用当地过去的事实，引导农民回忆过去相信政府号召、跟着共产党走的好处，使大家确信共产党和人民政府是“说到哪里，办到哪里”。粮食供应问题解决了以后，他们又启发群众多方面想办法找草源，克服了缺乏饲草的困难。
    这样做了以后，农民群众的顾虑大部分都解除了。马贵齐说：“毛主席对咱们真关心，从很远地方调来粮食供应咱，虽说供应有点缺点，因这是新事，也是难免的，什么事也是一步一步改进的。”全村四个社的全体社员一致表示：坚决服从国家种植计划，努力实现棉粮增产任务。单干农民也表示响应国家号召，保证按国家计划种植。杜恒发说：
  “毛主席想的真周到，三定办法保证了咱们棉区的粮食供应，种一亩棉花顶三亩谷子收的，为啥不多种呢？说实话，我去年种棉十亩，今年怕粮食不够吃，原打算种七亩。现在知道了这个办法，我的思想通了，一定要种十一亩半棉花。”
    解除了妨碍生产的思想顾虑，领导者的工作并不能就算是完结了；更重要的是领导群众做好生产工作，保证增产计划的实现。因此，工作组和支部一面对群众进行思想发动，解决口粮、饲草等问题，一面帮助农业生产合作社做好生产管理工作。他们首先帮助各社修订了全年生产计划，研究了当前农活的安排，然后帮助各社根据农活计划，把劳动力作了合理的调配。同时，向社员讲解了完成今年的农业增产计划对实现第一个五年计划的重要意义，提高了社员们的社会主义觉悟，领导社内外群众开展了劳动竞赛。六天时间，四个社已经把没有耕的地全部耕完，并且耙了两遍。过去这里没有锄麦的习惯，现在为了争取增产，社里发动八十名妇女，四天已锄麦三百五十亩。有四个社员一天排出了二亩地的积水。积肥工作也有很大成绩。社外的农民，在社的影响下，也把耕地耙地锄地积肥的工作做得很好。单干农民杜恒发有三亩棉花地到三月下旬还没有拔棉柴，现在也拔掉而且全部耕耙过了。为了争取棉花增产，社内社外农民都准备把棉籽全部粒选一遍。全村计划植棉三千八百六十亩，达到全村总耕地面积的百分之七十五。四个农业生产合作社计划由去年的每亩产三十八斤皮棉提高为四十七斤；丰产田二十多亩，每亩要求产皮棉一百斤以上；谷子计划由去年的每亩产二百五十斤提高为三百斤。全村男女劳力六百六十七名，投入春耕生产的已有四百二十二名，较三月二十四日前增加了一倍以上；地里人多了，街头茶铺没有闲人了。
    看！三月二十四日以前和现在，有了具体领导和没有具体领导，差别有多大啊！
