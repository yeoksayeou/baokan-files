Recently, a new atmosphere has emerged in Qingfu Township, Sihui County, Guangdong Province: the phenomenon of people going to the township government clamoring for grain purchase certificates has greatly decreased, the enthusiasm of farmers for spring plowing and drought resistance has increased, and the confidence of cadres in their work has greatly increased.

These changes occurred after the township earnestly rectified the unified grain sales work.

Qingfu Township is a large township with more than 2,300 people. Last year, the township increased grain production by 8 percent and overfulfilled the grain unified purchase task. However, in the grain purchase work, due to the lack of meticulous work by cadres and inaccurate estimation of output, some farmers sold part of their rations. Most cadres relaxed the unified grain sales work after the unified grain purchase. Some cadres were afraid of public complaints and had egalitarian ideas. Individual cadres engaged in malpractice, resulting in unreasonable phenomena in grain supply; some who should have been supplied were supplied less, and some who should not have been supplied were supplied instead. The barber Mo Yin in the township, with a family of four, only cultivated a few plots of miscellaneous grains. The cadres only approved the supply of 200 catties of grain as rations for six months. Township cadre Mo Linzu originally only lacked 200 catties of rations but falsely reported a shortage of 350 catties. Farmer Zhang Cai, who originally lacked 100 catties of grain, falsely reported a request for 200 catties. The cadres did not understand the situation because it was difficult to refuse due to "sentiment," so they approved it. With problems in the grain supply work, people who were not short of grain clamored even more for grain supply, and the unified sales work fell into chaos.

In order to correct this serious unreasonable phenomenon, the Qingfu Township Party Branch, in conjunction with spring plowing production, earnestly rectified the unified grain sales work.

First, meetings of Communist Party members and cadres were held separately to educate them on the grain unified sales policy. At the meetings, the malpractices of cadres Mo Linzu, Wu Tianlin, Mo Renqing, and others were criticized; cadres Li Lian, Mo Naishu, and others expressed that they would set an example, take the lead in saving grain, and vigorously publicize the grain unified sales policy to the masses, thoroughly investigate the grain storage situation of each household, and earnestly do a good job in this rectification of the unified grain sales work.

Then, mass meetings were held in large groups. Communist Party member Xiang Fenghao called on everyone at the meeting to "make careful calculations, and the state should supply as much as is really needed. If there is enough grain in storage, there is no need to apply." He said:

"My daughter and I have more than half a stone of unhusked rice at home, and we harvested two baskets of sweet potatoes in the spring. Calculating it all, we have enough rations, so I resolutely don't want the state to supply grain!" Township cadres Mo Yalian, Mo Yinying, Gu Jin, and others also proposed their own methods of saving grain, expressing that they would reduce or not require the state to supply grain. The exemplary actions of the cadres aroused the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses. Many farmers compared and evaluated each other and no longer "reported large numbers." More than 50 households initially reported large grain shortage figures, but at this time, they all voluntarily reduced the figures. Poor peasant Xue Quan and other five households canceled their self-reported "grain shortage" figures and no longer wanted the state to supply them. Xue Quan said, "To be honest, our grain is enough to eat if we save a little; buying more grain is not good for the country, nor is it good for ourselves; if we save some grain ourselves, our household expenses can also be more flexible."

However, at this time, there were still more than a dozen farmers clamoring for "grain shortage." For example, old middle peasant Gu Yawu had 200 catties of grain in storage at home, and also had five or six baskets of grain placed at his daughter's house, but he repeatedly pestered the cadres: "Everyone has a share, and I should also have a share!" Party Branch Secretary Mo Lin calculated the detailed grain account with him and explained to him: "Old Gu, if you have enough grain to eat, that's enough. If every household buys more grain, the country's grain supply will be affected. Therefore, we must act according to the policy. We should supply those who should be supplied, and we should not supply those who should not be supplied!"

Gu Yawu and these fake grain shortage households thought the reasoning was right and no longer requested a supply.

The grain supply figures for each household were reasonably determined. Originally, 152 households self-reported a shortage of 24,500 catties. Now, after each household's voluntary adjustment and the evaluation of cadres and the masses, it was finally announced: 15,000 catties of grain will be supplied to 137 households.

With a reasonable grain supply, everyone's production enthusiasm is even greater. Many farmers previously often kept the issue of rations in mind, but now they are wholeheartedly engaged in production. In the nearly half month after the rectification of the unified grain sales work, Qingfu Township dug five more wells, and the number of farmers fighting drought and rushing to transplant seedlings increased from more than 400 to more than 700. Twenty-two waterwheels were dispatched to draw water from the Yanshan water dam, which is 20 miles away from the township, for irrigation, so that more than 2,600 mu of the township's 3,000 mu of rice fields had water, preparing to transplant all the seedlings in time.

    清福乡整顿粮食统销工作以后
    秦放
    最近广东省四会县清福乡出现了新的气象：到乡政府吵着要购粮证的现象大大减少了，农民春耕抗旱的劲头提高了，干部的工作信心大大增长了。
    这些变化，是该乡认真整顿粮食统销工作以后发生的。
    清福乡是个有二千三百多人的大乡。去年，全乡增产粮食百分之八，超额完成了粮食统购任务。但在购粮工作中，由于干部工作不够细致，对产量估计不够准确，以致部分农民卖出了一部分口粮。多数干部在粮食统购以后放松了粮食统销工作，某些干部怕群众埋怨、存在着平均主义思想，个别干部又徇私舞弊，结果造成粮食供应中的不合理现象；有些该供应的供应少了，有些不该供应的反而供应了。乡里的理发匠莫荫，一家四口，只种了几分地的杂粮，干部只批准供应二百斤粮食，作为六个月的口粮。乡干部莫林祖本来仅缺口粮二百斤，却谎报缺粮三百五十斤。农民张财，本来缺粮一百斤，却谎报要求二百斤，干部没摸清情况，因为
  “情面”难却，就批准了。粮食供应工作有毛病，不缺粮食的人更加吵着要求供应粮食，统销工作陷于混乱状态。
    为了纠正这种严重的不合理现象，清福乡党支部结合春耕生产，认真地整顿了粮食统销工作。
    首先分别召开了共产党员会议和干部会议进行关于粮食统销政策的教育。会上并批判了干部莫林祖、吴天林、莫任清等人徇私舞弊的行为；干部黎莲、莫乃树等都表示要以身作则，带头节约粮食，并大张旗鼓地向群众宣传粮食统销政策，深入各户摸清存粮情况，认真把这次整顿粮食统销工作做好。
    接着，分大组召开了群众大会。共产党员乡凤好在会上号召大家“精打细算，确实需要多少，就要国家供应多少，存粮够吃的，就不必提”。他说：
  “我们两母女，家里还有石半谷，春收两箩番薯，算起来口粮够了，所以我坚决不要国家供应粮食！”乡干部莫亚莲、莫荫英、顾金等也纷纷提出自己节约粮食的办法，表示少要或不要国家供应粮食。干部们的模范行动激起了群众的爱国热情。许多农民互相对比、评议，都不“报大数”了。有五十多户起先报大了缺粮数字，这时都自动把数字降低了。贫农薛全等五户取消了自报的“缺粮”数字，不再要国家供应。薛全说：“说实话，我们的粮食节省一下是够吃的；多买了粮食，对国家没好处，对自己也没好处；如果自己节省些粮食，家用也可以宽动些。”
    但是，这时还有十多户农民叫嚷“缺粮”。如老中农顾亚五，家里存粮二百斤，另外还放了五、六箩谷在女儿家里，但他却一再向干部吵闹：“人有一份，我也该有一份！”党支部书记莫林同他算了一下粮食细账，并向他解释：“老顾，粮食够吃就算了，如果家家都多买粮食，国家的粮食供应就受到影响，所以，我们一定要按政策办事，该供应的就供应，不该供应的就不供应！”
    顾亚五这些假缺粮户想想道理很对，也就不再要求供应了。
    各户的粮食供应数字合理地确定了。原先有一百五十二户自报缺粮二万四千五百斤，现在，经过各户自动调整和干部、群众评定，最后宣布：给一百三十七户供应粮食一万五千斤。
    粮食得到合理供应，大家的生产劲头更大了。不少农民先前常常把口粮问题放在心上，现在是一心一意搞生产了。在整顿粮食统销工作后的近半个月内，清福乡又挖了五口水井，抗旱抢插的农民由四百多人增加到七百多人，还派出了二十二部水车，从离该乡二十里的燕山水陂引水灌溉，使全乡三千亩田中，有二千六百多亩田有了水，准备把全部秧苗及时地插下去。
