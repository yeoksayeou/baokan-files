    Can a Two-Wheel Two-Bottom Plow Be Made This Way?
    Xing Jiaju
    In June of last year, the Xiangyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Hubei Province decided at a professional conference that the local state-owned Xinguang and Ebei Iron Factories should manufacture new-style animal-powered agricultural implements. The plan was not small; at the time, it was projected that in 1954, two-wheel two-bottom plows would be manufactured first, and in 1955, sowing machines, harvesters, and other complete sets of new-style animal-powered agricultural implements would continue to be manufactured.

    Since the Prefectural Commissioner's Office had made a decision, the Xinguang Iron Factory began preparations. On the one hand, they absorbed workers, expanding from more than sixty people in the entire factory to one hundred and fourteen people. At the same time, they requested funds from the Prefectural Commissioner's Office to order lathes, drilling machines, and planers from the outside. On the other hand, they borrowed a two-bottom plow manufactured by the Northeast Lingshan Agricultural Implement Factory from the Prefectural Commissioner's Office farm. At first glance, it looked simple, so they decided to start manufacturing by imitating it. Everyone's spirits were high.

    So-called imitating meant: no manufacturing drawings were needed, nor were technical conditions required, let alone specifications for raw materials. As long as they looked at one, made one, and worked by comparing, any technical and equipment problems would be smoothly postponed and left unresolved. Thus, the plowshares and moldboards were pressed into shape with iron plates, the tips and surfaces were not hardened, and the tough iron parts were replaced with ordinary cast iron. The plow beams and axles were "topped up" with whatever materials were available. In this way, more than one hundred kinds of parts for a two-bottom plow were successively "made." After being assembled, at first glance, it did not seem worse than the products of the Lingshan Agricultural Implement Factory. After a few rounds of plowing in the field, it could also turn the soil. The two-bottom plow was thus "successfully trial-produced."

    After that, the Xinguang Iron Factory manufactured more than 400 units from June to the end of October, and the factory and the supply and marketing cooperatives successively sold 260 units to farmers. It is said that it once created a "sold out" phenomenon in the countryside.

    However, in early November, the two-bottom plow manufacturing situation of the Xinguang Iron Factory was discovered by a working group from the Hubei Provincial Department of Industry and the Department of Agriculture. Subsequently, the Department of Industry ordered the factory to stop manufacturing. The comrades in the Xiangyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office could not understand such a sudden "blow." The factory leaders even thought that this was a large factory suppressing a small factory, and that since the Provincial Agricultural Implement Factory was making two-bottom plows, they would not let them "eat." They insisted on continuing to process the semi-finished products that were in production. Up until the beginning of this year, a total of 550 units had been made, and after deducting those already sold, 290 units were stockpiled. This marked the end of this new product manufacturing effort, which did not have a pleasant ending.

    People may ask: What is the quality of the two-bottom plows made in this way? In a document from the Hubei Provincial Department of Industry to the Department of Agriculture, it was said that these plows were "still usable." Now let's talk about their use in the countryside and the farmers' reactions to see what "still usable" really means! According to the Xiangyang County Eighth District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, farmers generally expressed dissatisfaction and demanded returns within half a month of purchasing the goods. The information learned by the Provincial Department of Agriculture was: the plowshare was not easy to enter the soil; or the front and rear plows were of different depths, and the rear plow ran outwards; the plow beam was deformed; the pulling force was too great, and the cattle had difficulty pulling. In fact, it can be judged from the manufacturing situation of the parts: the plowshare and moldboard will wear out rapidly after being used for a period of time; and the tough iron parts replaced by ordinary cast iron will definitely break after being subjected to a certain external force. At the same time, the parts of these plows are basically not interchangeable. As long as a major part is broken, the plow will be suspended. No wonder the members of the Daying Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiangyang County said: "This is not called a two-bottom plow, it is called an eight-man plow." Meaning: not only can it not plow the land, but it also needs eight people to carry it. In the Xiangyang Special District, some two-bottom plows manufactured by the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory were also promoted. Wherever both Beijing and Xinguang plows were promoted at the same time, the masses were even more dissatisfied with the two-bottom plows manufactured by the Xinguang Iron Factory. Two production teams in the Xiyin Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiangyang County used two-bottom plows manufactured by the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory and two-bottom plows manufactured by the local Xinguang Iron Factory, respectively. The latter was extremely dissatisfied with the cadres of the cooperative, and even caused disunity between the two production teams. From this point of view, the so-called "still usable" of the Department of Industry is unreliable.

    Now the two-bottom plow production of the Xinguang Iron Factory has finally stopped. However, the losses caused to the farmers by the plows that have already been sold must be remedied. At the same time, the factory still has 290 two-bottom plows in stock, and the director of the Xinguang Iron Factory still has opinions on not being allowed to continue selling the two-bottom plows.

    How should these follow-up problems be handled?

    Last November, when the working group of the Hubei Provincial Department of Industry and the Department of Agriculture returned to the agency, they may have felt that the problem was troublesome, and did not mention this matter in the written work report, but only made an oral report to the leaders. After that, the problem was dragged down. Until now, the opinions on handling the follow-up are still in the official documents between the provincial-level agencies.

    On March 10 this year, the Department of Industry finally put forward specific opinions on the remaining two-bottom plows in a report to the Provincial Agricultural Implement Promotion Committee. The document said: "...Some parts must be replaced, including: important screws, plowshares, and washers should be changed to standard parts, plowshares should be changed to steel plowshares, and tough iron parts should be changed from ordinary cast iron to tough iron; in addition, spring washers and plow column reinforcement plates should be added; the finished products that do not meet the standards should also be appropriately modified. In order to reduce the loss of state property, it is proposed to instruct the factory to replace the above-mentioned parts before selling them again..." The document only lightly mentioned the two-bottom plows that have been sold with the phrase "also instruct the factory to be responsible for replacement." Let us leave aside the repetitions and incomprehensible parts in the document regarding important parts. We only need to ask: If the materials of the plow beam, axle, and traction rod do not meet the strength requirements, how should they be handled? What if the position of the drilling hole of the plow bracket is not correct? Should these parts be replaced? If so, how different would it be from re-manufacturing new plows? For the plows that have been sold, if you plan to replace so many parts in the countryside, have you considered the interchangeability of this batch of plows? Are there any conditions for using electric welding in the countryside? Otherwise, you will have to pull all these plows back to the factory to re-manufacture them.

    New-style animal-powered agricultural implements are powerful tools for increasing agricultural output and promoting the cooperative movement. Starting this year, the state is vigorously promoting two-wheel two-bottom plows in rural areas, and has strictly stipulated quality standards, requiring the working class to supply farmers with durable, inexpensive, and high-quality new-style agricultural implements. This can reflect the support for farmers and further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. The fact that the Xinguang Iron Factory manufactures two-bottom plows in a crude and shoddy way is precisely the opposite. The Department of Industry's handling of the follow-up problems only considers "reducing the loss of state property." However, has the Department of Industry thought about the prestige of the Party and the state? Has it considered the political and agricultural production losses? Has it considered the interests of the peasants and the worker-peasant alliance? Are these not the interests of the state? And between the two, which is more important? We believe that since 1953, the "hanging plow" and "sleeping car" have given us enough lessons, and we cannot allow the mistakes that have been made to be repeated. For this batch of two-wheel two-bottom plows, whether they have been sold or not, there is only one way out: apologize to the farmers, and the factory should recall and seal them all up, and then solve the problem of the factory's financial losses.

    Finally, it must be stated: the problem is not only the Xinguang Iron Factory, nor is it only the two-wheel two-bottom plow. Taking Hubei Province as an example, the Guanghua County Iron Factory in Xiangyang Special District also manufactured 50 two-bottom plows in the same way during the same period; the Ebei Agricultural Implement Factory also made three disc harrows, the harrow discs were not quenched, and one had already been sold to farmers; in the past few years, iron factories in more than a dozen counties in Hubei Province have imitated step plows, and none of them had manufacturing drawings. Now Hubei Province has finally stopped this phenomenon of crude and shoddy manufacturing. However, are there any special and county iron factories across the country that are still planning or are planning to manufacture new-style animal-powered agricultural implements and step plows in the same way by imitating? This is something that the relevant leading agencies and the leaders of agricultural implement factories in various places should pay attention to.

    The normal manufacturing method of new-style animal-powered agricultural implements must be manufactured in accordance with the state's unified arrangements and unified plans; and in accordance with the manufacturing drawings, technical conditions, and material specifications uniformly stipulated by the First Ministry of Machine Building. For step plows, there are also complete manufacturing drawings, and the provincial departments of industry should strengthen the control and management of step plow manufacturing. Only by taking the manufacturing of new-style animal-powered agricultural implements seriously can the products be truly welcomed by farmers, and can truly increase agricultural output, promote the socialist transformation of agriculture, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

    双轮双铧犁可以这样制造吗
    邢家驹
    去年六月份，湖北省襄阳专署在一次专业会议上决定要地方国营新光、鄂北等铁工厂制造新式畜力农具。计划可不能算小，当时预计一九五四年先制成双轮双铧犁，一九五五年还要继续制造播种机、收割机等整套的新式畜力农具。
    既然专署作了决定，新光铁工厂也就开始准备了。一方面吸收工人，从全厂六十多人扩大到一百一十四人，同时请专署批准款项向外订购车床、钻床、刨床。另一方面从专署农场借来一部东北灵山农具厂制造的双铧犁，猛一看倒还简单，于是就照葫芦画瓢，决定开始动手制造，大家情绪挺高。
    所谓照葫芦画瓢就是说：既不要制造图纸，也不需技术条件，更谈不上原材料的规格要求，只要看一件、做一件、比划着干，遇到技术和设备上不能解决的问题，顺水推舟，以不了了之。于是，犁铧、犁镜用铁板压成个模样，尖端与表面并未淬硬，韧铁件用普通铸铁代替，犁梁、轮轴买到什么材料就用什么材料“顶”上去。这样，一部双铧犁的一百余种零件也就陆续“制成”，装配起来后，乍看上去，并不见得比灵山农具厂的产品差，拿到地里耕上几个来回，也能翻土，双铧犁到此也就“试制成功”了。
    此后，新光铁工厂从六月到十月底共制造了四百多部，由该厂和供销合作社陆续卖给农民二百六十部。据说一度在农村中造成“脱销”现象。
    但是，到了十一月初，新光铁工厂的双铧犁制造情况被湖北省工业厅和农业厅的一个工作组发现了，随后工业厅命令该厂停止制造。对于这样一个突然的“打击”，襄阳专署的同志们当时还想不通，厂的领导更认为这是大厂压小厂，省农具厂在造双铧犁，就不让我们“吃饭”，并坚持着要继续加工在制的半成品。一直到今年年初，前后共造成五百五十部，除去已卖出的以外，积压了二百九十部，这才算结束了这场结尾并不愉快的新产品制造。
    人们也许要问：这样制成的双铧犁质量究竟如何呢？在湖北省工业厅给农业厅的一个公文中曾说这些犁“尚可使用”。现在还是让我们来谈一下它在农村中的使用情况和农民的反映，来看看这究竟是怎么样的“尚可使用”吧！根据襄阳县第八区供销合作社的反映，农民在购货半个多月后，已普遍表示不满，要求退货。省农业厅所了解的情况是：犁头不易入土；或则是前后犁深浅不一，后犁往外跑；犁梁变形；拉力过大，牛拉的时候很吃力。事实上，从零件的制造情况也就可以判断：犁铧、犁镜在使用过一段时期后，就会迅速磨损；以普通铸铁代替的韧铁件在遭受一定外力后，也就一定会折断。同时，这些犁的零件，基本上是不能互换的，只要坏了一个主要零件，这部犁就会形成悬搁。怪不得襄阳县大营乡农业生产合作社的社员说：“这不叫双铧犁，这叫八抬犁。”意思是：岂但不能耕地，还要八个人抬着走。在襄阳专区也曾推广了部分北京农业机械厂制造的双铧犁，凡是同时推广了北京和新光两种犁的地方，群众对新光铁工厂制造的双铧犁就更为不满。襄阳县西尹乡农业生产合作社有两个生产队，一个使用着北京农业机械厂制造的双铧犁，另一个使用着当地新光铁工厂制造的双铧犁，后者对社的干部极为不满，甚至还造成了两个生产队的不团结。这样看来，工业厅的所谓“尚可使用”，这话是不可靠的。
    现在新光铁工厂的双铧犁生产总算是停止了。但是，已售给农民的犁所造成的损失必须补救。同时，厂里还积压着二百九十部双铧犁，新光铁工厂的厂长对不允许他继续出售双铧犁，尚颇有意见。
    这些善后问题，如何处理呢？
    去年十一月，当湖北省工业厅和农业厅的工作组回到机关时，也许感到问题麻烦，在书面工作报告里，并未提到这件事，只是口头向领导上作了汇报。此后这个问题就被拖了下来。直到现在，处理善后的意见，也还在省一级机关的公文来往中。
    今年三月十日，工业厅在给省农具推广委员会的报告中，总算对尚存的双铧犁提出了具体意见，文中说：“……须将部分零件加以更换，内计：重要螺丝、犁铧、垫圈改为标准件，犁铧换为钢铧，韧铁件由普通铸铁改为韧铁；另增加弹簧垫圈及犁柱加强板等项；其成品不合标准者亦酌予修正。为了减少国家财产的损失，拟责成该厂将上项零件更换后再行出售……”。对已售出的双铧犁，文中只以“亦责成该厂负责更换”一语轻轻带过。我们姑不论文中所述对重要零件还有重复和令人难懂的地方。只须追问一下，犁梁、轮轴、牵引杆的材料若不合强度要求如何处理？犁托钻孔的位置不正怎么办？是不是将这些零件都加以更换呢？假使这样，同重新制造新的犁又有多大区别呢？对已售出的犁，如果准备在农村更换这许多零件，是否考虑过这批犁的互换性呢？在农村是否有条件使用电焊呢？否则，就只有将这批犁都拉回工厂重新制造了。
    新式畜力农具是提高农业产量和促进合作化运动的有力工具，国家从今年起正在大规模地向农村推广双轮双铧犁，并且严格规定了质量标准，要求工人阶级必须以坚固耐用、价廉物美的新式农具供应农民，这样才能体现对农民的支援，才能进一步巩固工农联盟。新光铁工厂对双铧犁粗制滥造的事实，恰恰与此相反。而工业厅对善后问题的处理也只是考虑“减少国家财产的损失”，但是，工业厅是否想到党和国家的威信呢？是否考虑到政治上和对农业生产上的损失呢？是否考虑到农民的利益与工农联盟呢？难道这些都不是国家的利益吗？而且两相权衡，又何重何轻呢？我们认为：一九五三年以来，“挂犁”“睡车”已经给了我们足够的教训了，不能允许已经犯过的错误重复出现。对这批双轮双铧犁，无论已售出和没有售出的，出路只有一条，向农民检讨错误，由工厂全部收回封存，然后再解决工厂资金的亏损问题。
    最后，必须说明：问题还不仅是新光铁工厂，也还不仅是双轮双铧犁。以湖北省来说，襄阳专区光化县铁工厂在同时期也以同样方法制造了五十部双铧犁；鄂北农具厂还造了三台圆盘耙，耙片没有淬火，且已卖了一台给农民；湖北省几年来共有十几个县的铁工厂仿造步犁，全都没有制造图纸。现在湖北省总算制止了这种粗制滥造现象，然而全国各专、县铁工厂是否还有或正在计划也以照葫芦画瓢的方式制造新式畜力农具和步犁的呢？这就值得各地有关领导机关和农具厂的领导同志注意了。
    新式畜力农具的正常制造方法，必须按照国家的统一安排、统一计划；按照第一机械工业部统一规定的制造图纸、技术条件和材料规格来制造。对于步犁，也有完整的制造图纸，各省工业厅应该加强对步犁制造的控制和管理。只有严肃对待新式畜力农具的制造，产品才能真正为农民所欢迎，也才能真正提高农业产量，促进农业的社会主义改造，巩固工农联盟。
