Mr. Chairman, esteemed delegates, friends:

    Conducting normal international trade is a matter of common concern to us. However, such trade must be conducted on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, without any political conditions attached for economic cooperation. If trade is not conducted on this basis, it signifies economic aggression by one country against another and will not raise the living standards within the invaded country. Allow me to elaborate briefly on this issue.

    Before the Second World War, the trade policies of Britain, France, and the Netherlands in Asia were primarily focused on seeking markets for their products and seizing territories to extract raw materials. Today, however, the trade policy of the United States has gone a step further. American monopoly capitalists are scouring the world for raw materials for their military industries. They are building military bases all over the world. They seek various resources in Asian countries, but they do not adequately supply industrial products and equipment in exchange. Consequently, several Asian countries have been hampered in developing their natural resources, and as a result, they only find that their productivity is declining and their foreign trade is imbalanced.

    Another change has also occurred. Before the Second World War, Western European countries exported industrial products to Southeast Asia in exchange for agricultural products and minerals, and then re-exported these agricultural products and minerals to the United States. At the same time, the United States exported its agricultural and industrial products to Western European countries at higher prices. Since the end of the war, this triangular trade has been disrupted, especially because Western European countries were unable to recover quickly in the post-war period. Now, American colonialists are using Japanese trade to replace the trade of Britain, France, and the Netherlands in Asia. Their methods are discrimination and monopoly. Their slogan is "American capital, Japanese technology, Southeast Asian raw materials." This is a policy that kills two birds with one stone. It both enslaves Japan and exploits Southeast Asia. This is the reason why the United States does not allow Japan to restore its normal relations with China.

    Let us see whether this American policy is beneficial or harmful to Japan. Previously, most of the coal, iron sand, salt, and soybeans needed by Japan were imported from China. After the Second World War, under American control, Japan was forced to import these things from the United States. The price of American coal is much higher than the price of Chinese coal. Naturally, this forces the production cost of Japanese steel to increase, thereby raising the production cost of other commodities. An article about Sino-Japanese trade was published in the March issue of the Tokyo "Oriental Economist." The article said that if the bans on twelve export goods, namely, tinplate, locomotives, automobile bodies, freighters, etc., could be lifted, then the market for Japanese industry could be expanded, and the depression could be reversed. The article concluded that trade restrictions between Japan and China should be broken, and only in this way would it be possible to restore the Sino-Japanese trade that was so beneficial to Japan.

    American Assistant Secretary of State Robertson once publicly stated that restoring Sino-Japanese trade would cause Japan and the British to leave the United States, thereby reducing America's prestige in the so-called free world. Precisely because of this, according to Kyodo News and International News Service reports, the economic counselor of the US Embassy in Tokyo threatened the Tokyo government in a statement on March 7, saying that any products made by Japan using Chinese raw materials would not be allowed to be shipped to the United States. In addition to these intimidation tactics, Washington has also ordered bandits under Chiang Kai-shek to plunder merchant ships at sea, hindering trade between Asian countries and between East and West. It is a great irony that the self-proclaimed warriors of the so-called free world are hindering others from freely engaging in trade.

    Since shaking off the shackles of colonialism, China has made rapid progress in industry, and its foreign trade is also increasing. In its first Five-Year Plan, approximately six hundred new or expanded modernized enterprise units have been established. We have solved the problem of capital accumulation. We do not need to rely on foreign loans. We do not adopt the means of exploiting our own people or any other people. Our method of accumulating capital is to increase production and practice strict economy. In the five years from 1950 to 1954, our investment amount has increased nearly seven and a half times.

    Indeed, the US blockade and embargo policy has hit many countries. But it has not been able to stop China from developing its national economy. In the past five years, China's economic relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies have made great strides. Our trade with these countries, based on a policy of friendship and mutual benefit, increased more than threefold between 1950 and 1954. During the same period, China's trade with all Asian countries increased by 23.25 percent. The governments of India, Burma, Indonesia, Ceylon, and Pakistan have signed trade agreements and contracts with China. Businessmen from Japan have signed trade protocols with Chinese companies. From these documents, it can be seen that all the stipulated commodities are precisely what the buying party needs, and not dumping. Neither party takes advantage of the other's difficulties, and neither party forces the other to accept harsh conditions. This kind of trade, based on equality and mutual benefit, does not have any political conditions attached. The agreed prices are fair to both parties and are not based on unequal conditions. It is this kind of international trade that helps the national economies of all participating countries develop.

    Obviously, if it were not for the US blockade and embargo policy, the development of our normal trade would have been even faster.

    At this moment, as we are gathered here for this conference, ships carrying Indian tobacco and Chinese raw silk, Burmese rice and Chinese industrial products, Indonesian copra and quinine and Chinese cotton yarn and cotton cloth, Ceylonese rubber and Chinese rice, Pakistani cotton and jute and Chinese coal are sailing on the high seas.

    The Chinese people advocate trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit because this will further promote our friendly relations and strengthen our economic cooperation. Indeed, we have great expectations for the future development of this kind of trade.

### 在平等互利的基础上发展亚洲国家间的贸易——中国代表陈翰笙八日在亚洲国家会议全体会议上的发言

    在平等互利的基础上发展亚洲国家间的贸易
    ——中国代表陈翰笙八日在亚洲国家会议全体会议上的发言主席先生，各位代表，各位朋友：
    进行正常的国际贸易是我们共同关心的事。但是，这种贸易必须在平等互利的基础上进行，为了经济合作，不附带任何政治条件。如果不是在这个基础上进行贸易，那就意味着一国对另一国进行经济侵略，而且不会提高被侵略国家内的生活水平。请允许我稍微谈一下这个问题。
    在第二次世界大战以前，英国、法国和荷兰在亚洲的贸易政策主要是为它们的产品寻求市场并且攫取领土以榨取原料。可是，今天美国的贸易政策更进了一步。美国垄断资本家们为他们的军火工业到处搜刮原料。他们在全世界修建军事基地。他们在亚洲国家找寻各种各样的资源，但是他们并不充分地供给工业产品和工业装备作为交换。因此，若干亚洲国家在开发它们的天然富源方面遭到了阻碍，结果只是发现它们的生产率下降，它们的对外贸易不平衡。
    还发生了另外一个变化。在第二次世界大战之前，西欧国家把工业产品输出给东南亚来换取农产品和矿产，而把这些农产品和矿产再出口给美国。同时，美国以较高的价格把它的农产品和工业产品输给西欧国家。自战争结束以来，这种三角贸易已被打断，由于西欧国家在战后时期不能够，也没有很快恢复，因此情况更其如此。现在美国殖民主义者在利用日本的贸易来取代英国、法国和荷兰在亚洲的贸易。他们的手段是歧视和垄断。他们的口号是“美国的资本，日本的技术，东南亚的原料。”这是一箭双雕的政策。它既奴役日本，又剥削东南亚。美国为什么不让日本恢复它同中国的正常关系，原因就在这里。
    我们看看美国的这一政策对日本是有利的呢，还是有害的。以前，日本所需要的大部分煤、铁砂、食盐和大豆都是从中国输入的。第二次大战后，日本在美国控制下，被迫从美国输入这些东西。美国煤的价格比中国煤的价格贵得多。很自然，这就迫使日本钢的生产成本提高，从而提高了其他商品的生产成本。在三月号东京“东方经济学家”上登载了一篇关于中日贸易的文章。文章说，如果关于十二种出口货，即白铁皮、机车、汽车车身、货船等等的禁令能够解除的话，那末日本工业的市场就能够扩大，萧条情况就可以扭转。这篇文章最后说，日本和中国之间的贸易限制应该打破，只有这样才有可能恢复对日本如此有利的中日贸易。
    美国助理国务卿罗伯逊有一次曾公开声明，恢复中日贸易会使日本和英国人离开美国，从而降低美国在所谓自由世界的威信。正是由于这一点，所以据共同社和国际新闻社报道，美国驻东京大使馆的经济参赞在三月七日的声明中威胁东京政府说，日本用中国原料制成的任何产品将不得运到美国去。除了这种恫吓手段外，华盛顿还命令蒋介石手下的匪徒劫掠海上商船，阻挠亚洲国家之间以及东西方之间的贸易。自封自命的所谓自由世界的战士竟然阻挠别人自由地进行贸易，真是极大的讽刺。
    中国自从摆脱了殖民主义者的枷锁以后，已经在工业方面取得了迅速的进步，它的对外贸易也正在增加。在它的第一个五年计划中，新建的或扩建的现代化企业单位大约有六百个。我们已经解决了资本积累的问题。我们不必要依赖外国贷款。我们也不采取剥削我们自己人民或其他任何人民的手段。我们积累资本的方法是增加生产，厉行节约。在从一九五○年到一九五四年的五年中，我们的投资额已经增加了将近七倍半。
    的确，美国的封锁禁运政策打击了许多国家。但是它并没有能阻止中国发展它的国民经济。在过去五年中，中国同苏联和人民民主国家的经济关系有了飞跃的进展。我们同这些国家间以友好互利政策为基础的贸易在一九五○年到一九五四年间增加到三倍多。在同一时期，中国同所有亚洲国家间的贸易增加了百分之二十三·二五。印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、锡兰和巴基斯坦的政府已同中国签订了贸易协定和合同。日本工商界人士同中国的公司签订了贸易议定书。从这些文件上可以看到，所有规定的商品正是买货的一方所需要的，而不是倾销。任何一方都不利用另一方的困难，任何一方都不强迫另一方接受苛刻的条件。这种以平等互利为基础的贸易并不附有任何政治条件。商定的价格对双方都是公平的，而不是以不平等的条件为根据的。帮助所有一切参与国的国民经济发展的，正是这一种国际贸易。
    显而易见，如果没有美国的封锁禁运政策，我们的正常的贸易的发展本来还可以快得多。
    在此刻，在我们在这里齐集一起开会的时候，装载着印度的烟叶和中国的生丝，缅甸的大米和中国的工业产品，印度尼西亚的椰干和奎宁和中国的棉纱和棉布，锡兰的橡胶和中国的大米，巴基斯坦的棉花和黄麻和中国的煤的船只正行驶在公海上面。
    中国人民主张以平等互利为基础进行贸易，因为这将进一步促进我们的友好关系和加强我们的经济合作。的确，我们对于这种贸易的未来发展怀有巨大的期望。          （新华社新德里十三日讯）
