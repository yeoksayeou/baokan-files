The Prime Minister of Ceylon, Sir John Kotelawala, stated at a specially held press conference in Bandung on the 21st that, in order to make him feel "at ease," he demanded that "China openly and formally call on local communist groups in Asia and Africa to disband." On the same day, he repeated this attack at the Political Committee of the Asian-African Conference. His argument was immediately supported by countries such as Turkey and Iraq. The Turkish representative, Zorlu, even jumped up and pounded the table with his fist during the debate, attempting to incite greater conflict with this crude attitude.

One must ask: What does all this deliberately spread rhetoric and affected posturing have in common with the purpose of the Asian-African Conference to promote friendship and cooperation between Asian and African countries?

Kotelawala "feeling uneasy" about the existence of the Communist Party in his country is his own business, and the Chinese people have no say in it. But he insists that China "call on" the communist parties in Asia and Africa to disband, which means he wants China to interfere in the internal affairs of Ceylon and Asian and African countries. It is strange that this kind of proposition comes from the mouth of a Kotelawala who opposes "any form of foreign interference."

It is known that ideologies are produced and spread on the basis of specific historical and social foundations. The fact that some people in a country believe in communism and a Communist Party appears, just like some people believe in Fabianism and a Socialist Party appears, is a matter for that country itself. Therefore, the existence of the Communist Party in Ceylon is entirely an internal political party issue of Ceylon and does not allow foreign interference. Kotelawala's request for China to interfere in Ceylon's internal affairs puts himself in an embarrassing position.

In his speech on the 19th, our Premier Zhou Enlai already pointed out that China will never interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. He stated that China is prepared to establish normal relations with Asian and African countries, and even countries around the world, especially our neighbors, on the basis of adhering to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

It can be fully believed that the desire for peaceful coexistence expressed by the Chinese delegation is also a common desire held by the majority of countries attending the Asian-African Conference. This also explains why the Ceylonese Prime Minister's remarks, which caused division and dispute, did not receive the sympathy of the majority of participants and aroused criticism from many people.

The Prime Minister of Ceylon also made a statement on the Taiwan issue at the press conference. He distorted the history of Taiwan and advocated that Taiwan be placed under international trusteeship for a few years, and then made it an "independent country." As everyone knows, Premier Zhou Enlai has already stated clearly at the Asian-African Conference that the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands "is entirely a matter of internal affairs and the exercise of its own sovereignty." He also stated that China does not want to raise the issue of the Taiwan situation at the conference in order to avoid the conference falling into disputes and failing to be resolved. Obviously, Kotelawala's proposition on the Taiwan issue is essentially a proposition that interferes in China's internal affairs and has the danger of causing division and dispute at the conference. Precisely because of this, many countries attending the conference also expressed indifference to his proposition.

Of course, there are people who are happy, although they may be happy too early. Agence France-Presse reported that Kotelawala's remarks made the "semi-official American observers" in Bandung "extremely happy." They denied that Kotelawala's remarks were instructed by Britain or the United States. But it is worth pondering that: at the same time that Kotelawala made a proposition on the Taiwan issue, the British Information Office also published a "lawyer's" commentary that was exactly the same.

The Prime Minister of Ceylon participated in initiating the Asian-African Conference, and he participated in stipulating the purpose of the Asian-African Conference. But he made these remarks at the conference that could only cause disputes, making those who wanted to sabotage the conference happy. What does this mean? Did he abandon the purpose of the conference?

    不应该背弃亚非会议的目的
    蒋元椿
    锡兰总理科特拉瓦拉二十一日在万隆特别举行的一次记者招待会上表示，为了使他能够感到“放心”，他要求“中国公开地和正式地要求亚非两洲各地的当地共产主义团体解散”。在同一天，他在亚非会议政治委员会上也重复了这种攻击。他的这种论调立刻得到了土耳其、伊拉克等国的支持。土耳其代表佐鲁在辩论中甚至跳起来用拳头敲桌子，企图用这种粗暴的态度来激起更大的纷争。
    人们要问：所有这一切故意散布的论调和做作的姿态，和亚非会议的促进亚非各国间的亲善和合作的目的有什么共同之处呢？
    科特拉瓦拉对于在他的国家里存在共产党“感到不安”，这是他自己的事情，中国人民管不着。但是他硬要中国“号召”亚洲和非洲各地的共产党解散，意思就是要中国去干涉锡兰和亚非国家的内政。这种主张出之于一个反对“任何形式的外来干涉”的科特拉瓦拉之口，倒是很奇怪的。
    人们知道，思想意识是在一定的历史和社会的基础上产生和传播的。在一个国家里有人信奉共产主义，出现了共产党，就像有人信奉费边主义，出现了社会党一样，是这个国家自己的事情。因此，在锡兰存在共产党，完全是锡兰内部的政党问题，是不容外人干涉的。科特拉瓦拉要求中国干涉锡兰的内政，他这种要求使自己落入了一种多么尴尬的地位。
    我国周恩来总理在十九日的发言中已经指出，中国决不会去干涉别国的内政。他表示，中国准备在坚守五项原则的基础上和亚非各国、乃至世界各国、首先是我们的邻邦，建立正常关系。
    完全可以相信，中国代表团所表示的这种和平共处的愿望，也是出席亚非会议的大多数国家共同抱有的愿望。这也就说明了为什么锡兰总理这种引起分歧和争端的论调没有得到大多数与会者的同情，而且引起了许多人的抨击。
    锡兰总理在记者招待会上还就台湾问题发表了谈话。他歪曲台湾的历史，并且主张把台湾由国际托管几年，然后使它成为“独立国”。大家知道，周恩来总理已经在亚非会议上明白地说过，中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿“完全是内政和行使自己的主权”。他并且表示中国不想在会议中提出台湾局势问题，以免会议陷入争论而得不到解决。很明显，科特拉瓦拉关于台湾问题的主张，实质上是一种干涉中国内政的主张，并且有使会议陷入分歧和争论的危险。正因为如此，出席会议的许多国家对他的这个主张也表示冷淡。
    当然，高兴的人是有的，虽然他们也许高兴得早了一些。法新社报道说，科特拉瓦拉的论调使在万隆的“半官方的美国观察家们欢欣异常”。他们否认科特拉瓦拉的论调是出自英国或美国授意的。但是值得玩味的是：就在科特拉瓦拉发表关于台湾问题的主张的同时，英国新闻处也发表了一篇如出一辙的“一个律师”的评论。
    锡兰总理参加发起亚非会议，他参加规定了亚非会议的目的。但是他却在会议中发表这些只能引起争端的言论，使那些想破坏会议的人们高兴。这是什么意思呢？难道他背弃了会议的目的么？
