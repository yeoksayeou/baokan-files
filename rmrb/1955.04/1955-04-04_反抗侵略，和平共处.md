Editorial:

    Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech to the People's House of the Indian Parliament on March 31 regarding the Asian-African Conference and the current situation in Asia. Nehru pointed out that the Asian-African Conference is a definite symbol of the rise of Asia. He stated that the common purpose of Asian and African countries is peace and opportunity for development. He condemned the United States' conspiracies to organize military blocs and create divisions in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. He also condemned the United States' aggressive actions against China's coastal islands. Nehru called for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence to serve as a solid foundation for consolidating peace. These propositions align with the aspirations of the Asian people and peace-loving people around the world, and will have a positive influence on the Asian-African Conference.
    As Prime Minister Nehru pointed out, there is a strong call for peace all over the world, and even more so in Asian and African countries. The common bond of the Asian and African people is "everyone has a desire for freedom and peace." It is very natural for the Asian and African people to have this desire. For centuries, the Asian and African people have been shackled by colonialism, subjected to brutal exploitation, and often used by colonialists as tools for their colonial wars and inter-imperialist wars. The colonialists' ruthless plunder and war destruction of Asian and African countries have created poverty and backwardness in these countries.
    Now, the awakened Asian and African people can no longer tolerate the status of being at the mercy of others. The Asian and African people strongly demand freedom and independence, demand peace, and demand unity and cooperation with the people of other countries on an equal footing without foreign interference. Only with peace can we guarantee progress and development, and conduct economic and cultural exchanges with the people of other countries. Because of this, the people of Asian and African countries are willing to be friendly to each other and work together for peace. The Asian-African Conference is a necessary product of this historical development.
    The aspirations and demands of the Asian and African people are also specifically embodied in the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by the Prime Ministers of China and India, and China and Burma. The basic spirit of the Five Principles is that all countries coexist peacefully, do not invade others, and do not allow others to invade themselves; do not interfere with others, and do not allow others to interfere with themselves. It is Asian countries, rather than Western colonial countries, that have long suffered and are still suffering from foreign aggression and interference, that advocate the Five Principles, and this has its historical inevitability. As Prime Minister Nehru said, these Five Principles are a challenge posed by Asia to the rest of the world. This also explains why the Five Principles have gained increasingly widespread support among the people of the world, especially the people of Asia and Africa.
    However, the colonial countries, headed by the United States, always believe that they, not the people, create history. They are hostile and afraid of the awakening and rise of the Asian and African people, and attempt to continue enslaving the Asian and African people according to centuries-old conventions. They hate the unity and cooperation of the Asian and African people, and hate the Five Principles. Now, they are even more focused on hating the Asian-African Conference. They attempt to use all means and from all channels to undermine the peaceful coexistence among the Asian and African people in order to maintain their position in Asia and Africa.
    It is from this intention that the American aggressor group takes a confrontational stance against the Asian and African people everywhere. For countries that have already gained independence, the United States does its best to infringe upon their independence and interfere in their internal affairs. The United States' occupation of China's Taiwan and interference in the internal affairs of Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam are clear examples. For countries that are striving for independence, the United States does its best to suppress and control them, establish military bases on their territories, and station American troops. The United States and other Western colonial countries also want Asian and African countries to believe, as the British Information Service claims, that only by "relying" or "expecting" Western colonial countries can there be so-called "independence." In reality, this is an attempt to keep those Asian and African countries striving for independence in a vassal state.
    The Asian and African people demand mutual friendship and cooperation, but the United States does its best to sow discord and create disharmony and division. The United States has obstructed the peaceful reunification of Korea, causing Korea to remain divided, and is now doing its best to undermine the Geneva Accords in Indochina, attempting to create a divided situation in Vietnam as well. The United States has organized the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, attempting to create division and antagonism in Asia. The United States recently organized a military bloc in the Middle East, creating division between Egypt, Syria, and other Arab countries. As Prime Minister Nehru pointed out, the Middle East "has been divided into hostile camps." The United States also spares no effort to provoke relations between China and other Asian countries. Recently, in response to the convening of the Asian-African Conference, the United States has particularly focused on provoking relations between China and India. However, the recent agreement between China and India regarding the Indian government transferring its postal, telegraph, telephone, and other enterprises and equipment, as well as stations and equipment, operated in China's Tibet region to our country fully proves that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence can stand the test.
    The United States' creation of division and antagonism in Asia aims to implement the conspiracy of "Asians fighting Asians," using some Asian countries to oppose other Asian countries, and preparing for new wars. For this purpose, the United States uses various methods in Asia to flaunt its strength, clamor for atomic warfare, and attempt to use the threat of war to force some Asian countries to abandon their independent sovereignty and follow the United States on the path of war.
    The United States' policy of aggression and policy of war are being resisted in Asia and the Middle East. Government leaders of major Asian and African countries, such as India, Indonesia, Burma, and Egypt, have all expressed that they are in favor of peaceful coexistence and not in favor of aggression and war.
    However, the United States completely disregards this trend of resistance and vigorously pursues its policy of aggression and policy of war. Its violent war threat is now particularly manifested in its occupation of China's territory of Taiwan. After the Bangkok Conference, the United States is planning a conspiracy to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan by expanding the threat of war, attempting to drag some Commonwealth countries into a war of aggression against China on the common basis of colonial interests. Reuters reported on March 31 that some Commonwealth countries have indicated that as long as the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops withdraw from the coastal islands, they will be able to "firmly express their determination to support" the United States' actions to occupy Taiwan. It seems that Britain and some other Commonwealth countries want to create a fait accompli of so-called "two Chinas," and then use concerted action with the United States to coerce the Chinese people into recognizing this fact and tolerating the United States' occupation of Taiwan.
    The Chinese people resolutely oppose this conspiracy. Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and the coastal islands are all Chinese territory. Any attempt to use China's territory to carry out their ugly bargaining is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and absolutely cannot allow so-called "two Chinas." All American armed forces must withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. No war threat can frustrate the Chinese people's firm will.
    Prime Minister Nehru's above-mentioned propositions prove that there are common historical encounters and many common desires and demands among the Asian and African people. If the Asian and African people can act according to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence without foreign interference, then it is entirely possible to further strengthen unity and cooperation. The Asian-African Conference is a favorable opportunity to promote this possibility. For the Chinese people, peace in the Asian-African region and the world is a matter of extreme concern. We believe that true peace must be built on the basis of national independence and sovereignty, free from aggression. We believe that this belief is also commonly held by the broad masses of people in the Asian-African region. Based on this belief, in order to promote friendship and cooperation among Asian and African countries, and in order to promote peace in Asia, Africa, and the world, we are willing to work together with the people of Asian and African countries to make due contributions.

### 反抗侵略，和平共处

    反抗侵略，和平共处
    印度总理尼赫鲁三月三十一日在印度国会人民院就亚非会议和当前亚洲局势发表了演说。尼赫鲁指出，亚非会议是亚洲兴起的一个肯定的象征。他表明，亚非国家的共同目的就是和平和发展的机会。他谴责了美国在东南亚和中东组织军事集团、制造分裂的阴谋。他也谴责了美国对中国沿海岛屿的侵略行为。尼赫鲁要求以和平共处的五项原则作为巩固和平的坚实的基础。这些主张是符合于亚洲人民和世界爱好和平人民的愿望的，对于亚非会议将能够产生良好的影响。
    正如尼赫鲁总理所指出的，在全世界各地都有一种要求和平的强烈呼声，在亚非国家更其如此。亚非人民的共同联系，就是“大家有着要求自由和和平的愿望”。亚非人民具有这种愿望，是十分自然的事情。几世纪来，亚非人民被戴上了殖民主义的镣铐，遭受了残酷的剥削，并且时常被殖民主义者当做他们进行殖民战争和帝国主义之间的战争的工具。殖民主义者对亚非国家的无情掠夺和战争破坏，造成了这些国家贫困和落后的境况。
    现在，觉醒了的亚非人民再也不能忍受那种听任别人摆布自己命运的地位了。亚非人民强烈地要求自由独立，要求和平，要求不受外国干涉地在平等的地位上同其他国家的人民团结合作。要有和平，才能保证获得进步和发展，并且同其他国家的人民进行经济上和文化上的交流。因为这样，所以亚非各国人民愿意互相友好，共同合作为和平而努力。亚非会议就是这一历史发展所必然产生的东西。
    亚非人民的这种愿望和要求，也具体表现在中印、中缅总理所倡导的和平共处的五项原则里。五项原则的基本精神是各国和平相处，不侵犯别人，也不容许别人侵犯自己；不干涉别人，也不容许别人干涉自己。倡导五项原则的是长期遭受过，而且还正在遭受着外国的侵犯和干涉的亚洲国家而不是西方殖民国家，这是有其历史的必然性的。正如尼赫鲁总理所说的，这五项原则是亚洲向世界其他地区提出的挑战。这也就说明了为什么五项原则在全世界人民、特别是亚非人民中间得到愈来愈广泛的拥护和支持。
    但是，以美国为首的殖民国家们却总以为创造历史的是它们而不是人民。它们敌视和害怕亚非人民的觉醒和兴起，企图按照几世纪来的成规继续奴役亚非人民。它们仇视亚非人民的团结合作，仇视五项原则。现在，它们更集中地仇视亚非会议。它们企图用一切办法，从各种途径来破坏亚非人民之间的和平共处，以便保持自己在亚非两洲的地位。
    正是从这样的打算出发，美国侵略集团处处和亚非人民采取对立的立场。对于已经取得了独立的国家，美国竭力侵犯它们的独立，干涉它们的内政。美国强占中国的台湾，干涉柬埔寨、老挝、南越的内部事务，都是明显的例子。对于正在争取独立的国家美国竭力镇压和控制它们，在它们领土上，建立军事基地，驻扎美国军队。美国和西方其他殖民国家并且要亚非国家相信像英国新闻处所主张的，只有“投靠”或是“指望”西方殖民国家，才可能有所谓“独立”。实际上这就是企图使那些争取独立的亚非国家继续处于附庸的地位。
    亚非人民要求相互友好合作，美国却竭力进行挑拨离间，制造不和和分裂。美国阻挠了朝鲜的和平统一，使朝鲜继续陷于分立，现在又在印度支那竭力破坏日内瓦协议，企图在越南也造成分裂的局面。美国组织东南亚侵略集团，企图在亚洲制造分裂和对立。美国最近又在中东组织军事集团，在埃及、叙利亚和其他阿拉伯国家之间制造分裂。正如尼赫鲁总理所指出的，中东“已经分裂成敌对的阵营”。美国也不遗余力地挑拨中国和其他亚洲国家之间的关系。最近针对着亚非会议的召开，美国特别着重挑拨中国和印度之间的关系。但是最近中印两国之间关于印度政府将其在中国西藏地方所经营的邮政、电报、电话等企业及其设备和驿站及其设备移交给我国，就充分证明了和平共处的五项原则是经得起考验的。
    美国在亚洲制造分裂和对立，其目的是要实行“亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋，利用一部分亚洲国家来反对另一部分亚洲国家，准备新的战争。为了这个目的，美国在亚洲用各种方法炫耀实力，叫嚣原子战争，企图用战争威胁来迫使亚洲一些国家放弃自己的独立主权，跟随美国走战争的道路。
    美国的侵略政策和战争政策，正在亚洲和中东受到抵抗。亚洲和非洲的主要国家，像印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸和埃及等国的政府领袖都表示他们是赞成和平共处而不赞成侵略，不赞成战争的。
    但是美国却丝毫不顾这种抵抗的趋势，而极力推行它的侵略政策和战争政策。它的狂暴的战争威胁，现在特别表现在它强占中国领土台湾的问题上。在曼谷会议以后，美国正在策划一个用扩大战争威胁来阻挠中国人民解放台湾的阴谋，企图在殖民利益的共同基础上，把有些英联邦国家一起拖进侵略中国的战争。路透社在三月三十一日报道说，有些英联邦国家已经表示，只要蒋贼军撤出沿海岛屿，它们将可以“坚决表示它们决心支持”美国侵占台湾的行动。看来英国和另一些英联邦国家想要造成所谓“两个中国”的既成事实，然后用和美国一致行动来胁迫中国人民承认这个事实，容忍美国侵占台湾。
    中国人民坚决反对这个阴谋。台湾、澎湖和沿海岛屿都是中国的领土。任何人企图利用中国的领土来进行他们之间的丑恶的讨价还价，都是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。中国人民一定要解放台湾，绝对不能容许有所谓“两个中国”。美国一切武装力量一定要从台湾和台湾海峡撤走。任何战争威胁都不能挫折中国人民的坚决意志。
    尼赫鲁总理的上述主张证明：在亚非人民之间有着共同的历史上的遭遇，有着许多共同的愿望和要求。在亚非人民之间如果能不受外来干涉地按和平共处的五项原则行事，那末进一步加强团结和合作，是完全可能的。亚非会议对于促进这种可能性是一个有利的机会。对于中国人民来说，亚非地区和全世界的和平是我们极端关心的事情。我们相信，真正的和平一定要建立在各国独立自主、不受侵犯的基础之上。我们相信这种信念也是亚非地区广大人民共同具有的。本着这种信念，为了促进亚非各国间的亲善和合作，为了促进亚非两洲和世界的和平，我们愿意同亚非各国人民共同努力，以便作出应有的贡献。
