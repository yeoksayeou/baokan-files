Can the Party Newspaper Treat Party Life Propaganda This Way?
Lǐ Linghua

Since the release of the Communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, the Party newspapers of many provinces and cities have begun to strengthen the propaganda of Party life. They have made certain efforts in publicizing Party unity, upholding the principle of collective leadership of the Party, opposing the exaggeration of individual roles and the cult of personality, and carrying out criticism and organizing discussions on ideological issues within the local Party. However, until now, the editorial departments of some provincial and municipal Party newspapers have not regarded strengthening the propaganda of Party life as one of the primary tasks of the Party newspaper. Consequently, they have not taken practical measures to strengthen the Party Life Group. The number of cadres in this group is small, and their quality is poor. Some Party newspapers of the Party committees have not even established a Party Life Group until now. Naturally, it is difficult to talk about strengthening the propaganda of Party life in the newspapers.

For example, the editorial department of the Lüda People's Daily abolished the Propaganda Group (responsible for theoretical propaganda and Party life reporting) in 1952 due to some cadre transfers. Since then, it has not established a Party Life Group. Currently, an editor in the General Editorial Office concurrently manages the propaganda work of Party life. When other tasks become urgent, this work is often neglected. This phenomenon of no one being responsible for the propaganda of Party life is reflected in the newspaper, where reports on Party life are intermittent, fragmented, and weak. From May of last year to March of this year, within ten months, the Party Life column of the Lüda People's Daily published only fourteen reports (excluding reprints). Sometimes, the entire month passed without this column. Even some major issues in Party life were not reflected. For instance, the Party Committee of Dalian Engineering and Mining Vehicle Factory was engaged in unprincipled disputes for a long time. As the organ of the Lüda Municipal Party Committee, the Lüda People's Daily did not promptly expose and criticize it, but showed an inappropriate silence. It was only later, when the Liaoning Daily published relevant reports, that this newspaper reprinted them. It is worth noting that the editorial department of the Lüda People's Daily did not actively take measures to overcome this shortcoming after exposing this serious defect in its work.

Why has the editorial department of the Lüda People's Daily been delaying the establishment of a Party Life Group and failing to effectively strengthen the propaganda of Party life? The reason given by the leading cadres of the newspaper is: "Lack of cadres," "Waiting for the Municipal Party Committee to allocate them." It is true that the cadre conditions of the Lüda People's Daily are not very good. However, since this newspaper can establish an Industry Group, an Agriculture Group, a Culture and Education Group, a Finance and Economics Group, and a Letters from Readers Group, but cannot establish a Party Life Group, who can consider this a normal phenomenon? Besides demonstrating that the leading cadres of the newspaper do not attach importance to the propaganda of Party life, what other explanation can there be? Of course, the CPC Lüda Municipal Committee also bears responsibility for turning a blind eye to the fact that its organ newspaper has not established a Party Life Group and that the propaganda of Party life is very weak for a long time.

The recently held National Conference of the Party and the resolutions it adopted have put forward huge propaganda tasks for the Party's newspapers. This requires the Party's newspapers to vigorously publicize the Party's leading role in the national construction cause, the great significance of strengthening Party unity, the implementation of the Party's democratic centralism and the principle of collective leadership of the Party, and the great significance of strengthening the Party's ideological and political work and resolutely fighting against the erosion of bourgeois ideology. Since the Party newspaper is the Party's most powerful ideological weapon, it must, of course, make the greatest efforts to undertake this major propaganda task. The Lüda People's Daily and other newspapers with similar situations should now establish and strengthen the Party Life Group in the editorial department to effectively strengthen the propaganda of Party life. Is there any doubt about this?

    党报能够这样对待党的生活宣传吗
    李凌华
    自从党的七届四中全会公报公布以来，许多省、市的党委机关报都开始加强了党的生活的宣传，无论在宣传党的团结，坚持党的集体领导原则，反对夸大个人作用和个人崇拜，以及针对当地党内思想问题开展批评组织讨论等方面，都作了一定的努力。但直到目前，有的省、市委机关报的编辑部，还没有把加强党的生活的宣传看作党报的首要任务之一，因而他们也就没有采取实际措施来加强党的生活组，这个组的干部数量既少，质量也差，甚至有的党委的机关报一直到现在为止还没有设立党的生活组。这样自然就很难谈到加强报纸上的党的生活宣传了。
    举个例子说，旅大人民日报编辑部在一九五二年因为干部有些调动取消了宣传组（负责理论宣传和党的生活报道），以后就一直没有设立党的生活组，现在只是由总编辑室一个编辑兼管党的生活的宣传工作，当其它任务一紧，对这项工作也就只好置之不顾。对党的生活宣传的这种无人负责现象反映在报纸上，就是关于党的生活的报道断断续续，零碎无力。从去年五月到今年三月的十个月内，旅大人民日报的党的生活栏只发表过十四篇报道（转载的不在内），有时整月都没有这一栏。就是党的生活中的一些重大问题也没有得到反映，如大连工矿车辆厂党委会长期以来闹无原则纠纷，作为旅大市委机关报的旅大人民日报，并没有及时加以揭发和批判，而表现了不应有的沉默，只是后来当辽宁日报发表了有关的报道，这个报纸才加以转载。值得注意的是，旅大人民日报编辑部在暴露了工作中的这一严重缺点后，并没有积极采取措施来克服这个缺点。
    为什么旅大人民日报编辑部一直迟迟不设立党的生活组，不去切实加强党的生活的宣传呢？报社领导干部所持的理由是：“缺乏干部”，“等待市委给配备上再说”。不错，旅大人民日报的干部条件并不是很好的。但是，这个报纸既然能够设立工业组、农业组、文教组、财经组和读者来信组，而只是不能设立党的生活组，谁能认为这是正常的现象呢？这除了说明报社领导干部对党的生活宣传不重视，还能有什么其他解释呢？当然，中共旅大市委对自己机关报没有设立党的生活组和党的生活宣传十分薄弱的状况，长时期来熟视无睹，也不是没有责任的。
    最近举行的党的全国代表会议和它所通过的决议，向党的报纸提出了巨大的宣传任务。这就要求党的报纸大力宣传党在国家建设事业中的领导作用，宣传加强党的团结的重大意义，宣传贯彻党的民主集中制和党的集体领导原则，加强党的思想政治工作、同资产阶级思想的侵蚀进行坚决斗争的重大意义。党报既然是党的最有力的思想武器，当然要以最大的努力来担负起这个重大的宣传任务。旅大人民日报和其他有类似情况的报纸，现在应该在编辑部设立和加强党的生活组，以切实加强党的生活的宣传，难道还有什么疑问吗？
