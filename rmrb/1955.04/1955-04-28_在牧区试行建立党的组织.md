    After political education and production movements, a large number of outstanding individuals have emerged from among the people of all ethnic groups in the Altay Prefecture of Xinjiang Province. This has prepared favorable conditions for piloting the establishment of Party organizations in pastoral areas. The CPC Altay Prefectural Committee has decided to focus on piloting the establishment of Party organizations in Altay, Burqin, Habahe, and Jimunai counties, and has already transferred 18 Party member cadres of all ethnic groups from various counties and the prefectural organs, concentrating them to study the knowledge of establishing the Party in minority areas, to ensure the success of this work.

    在牧区试行建立党的组织
    新疆省阿勒泰专区各族农牧民，经过政治教育和生产运动，已涌现出大批优秀分子。这给在牧区试行建立党组织准备了良好的条件。中共阿勒泰地委决定在阿勒泰、布尔津、哈巴河、吉木乃四县重点试行建立党的组织，并已抽调各县及专区机关的各族党员干部十八名，集中学习了在少数民族地区建立党的知识，以保证做好这一工作。
