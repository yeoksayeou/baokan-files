How We Exceeded Our Building Cost Reduction Plan
Wei Yun, Deputy Manager of the Third Engineering Company of the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Construction

Under the correct leadership of the higher authorities, all employees of the Third Engineering Company of the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Construction emphasized cost reduction in last year's construction, and established various responsibility systems. Therefore, while ensuring quality, they exceeded the cost reduction plan, saving funds accounting for 13.93 percent of the total project cost. This included savings of more than 742,000 yuan in material costs, more than 230,000 yuan in labor costs, more than 28,000 yuan in administrative management fees, and more than 340,000 yuan in project business expenses.

Strengthening planning management is the foundation for promoting the economic accounting system. Before the start of construction, each site formulated construction measures plans based on the principles of reducing project costs and ensuring quality. After construction began, they promptly prepared monthly and ten-day operation plans, assigning various indicators that each work section and each team could complete each day to each worker through the plans, and regularly announced the results of execution according to the completion time of the operation plans. This allowed each worker to know how much wealth they had accumulated for the country or how much wealth they had wasted when completing each operation plan. Therefore, workers generally paid great attention to cost reduction during construction. For example, in order to complete the team operation plan, each trade team at construction site 12 put forward specific measures: the carpentry team proposed to ensure accurate material cutting to avoid defective products and to use scrap materials as much as possible to save finished materials; the tile and masonry teams proposed to achieve four cleans: clean mortar troughs, use all bricks, clean the mortar hanging on the brick walls, and pick up the mortar that fell on the ground. Transport workers ensured no broken bricks were left at the bottom of the stack, no mortar was dropped when carrying mortar, and no mortar was left in the mortar troughs after work; concrete workers proposed to avoid dropping mortar, running grout, and damaging cement bag paper. Plumbing and electrical workers proposed accurate material cutting to avoid losing parts and leaving pipe ends, etc. Because each trade had specific measures, and most of the departments at the sites signed technical supply liaison contracts with the work sections, basically ensuring the timely supply of materials and labor, not only were the construction plans of each site completed on schedule, but also the cost reduction plans of most teams were completed.

Strengthening material supply plans and transportation and storage, and reducing material consumption quotas are the main keys to reducing costs. Judging from the situation in Heilongjiang, local construction enterprises often receive tasks late, and design budgets cannot be submitted in a timely manner. In order to reduce the blindness of material supply, the company, on the one hand, actively assisted construction units in preparing budgets, and on the other hand, determined material demand plans according to the estimates, determined sources of goods based on this plan, researched and organized transportation forces, and then prepared 80 percent of the materials in advance according to the site layout plan. The measures taken in material preparation work were to use local materials or materials from nearby sources as much as possible, and to utilize stockpiled materials. For materials with large demand, the company organized construction sites with production capacity and possible conditions to produce or process them. For example, most of the stone, sand, mud tiles, large hardware, cement pipes, and other materials used in the projects at construction sites 12 and 13 were produced or processed and supplied by the construction sites themselves. This measure not only solved the problems of workers idling before the start of construction due to lack of work, but also ensured the timely supply of materials, and saved the country more than 152,000 yuan (excluding freight savings). During construction, the company also frequently studied and checked the completion of material supply plans through balance meetings, and took appropriate measures in a timely manner to ensure the realization of supply plans. The company also paid great attention to the storage of materials. At the beginning of material preparation work, it stipulated the material stacking positions and leveled the ground. For large piles of materials, it implemented a numbered storage method, so that materials were unloaded where they were used, avoiding losses from shuffling and stacking, and saving a lot of transportation costs. In terms of material transportation, supervision of loading and unloading was required, with gentle handling. When transporting materials packaged in paper or straw bags, such as cement, spare bags were carried, and new bags were replaced in a timely manner when there were leaks. Due to the strengthening of material management, a lot of funds were saved for the country. For example, construction site 12 saved a total of 159,000 red bricks by reducing the consumption of red bricks; and saved a total of more than 25,100 kilograms of cement by reducing the consumption of cement.

On the premise of ensuring project quality, each construction site widely used waste materials to replace finished materials, and established processing plants for wood, steel bars, galvanized iron, iron pipes, etc., implemented centralized cutting and unified material distribution, thereby reducing material loss rates and improving waste material utilization rates. For example, construction site 12 used short wood and old boards to modify fish-scale window frames, saving a total of 135 cubic meters of good wood, and used steel bar ends to process hacksaws, ash rakes, mushroom nails, etc., saving a total of 1,367 kilograms of good steel bars.

In the process of carrying out labor competitions, leading and mobilizing employees to actively put forward rationalization proposals and promote advanced experiences is of great significance for reducing costs. The company's employees put forward a total of 103 relatively significant rationalization proposals throughout the year, of which 70 were adopted after research, saving a large amount of wood, cement, steel bars, and other materials. Over the year, various construction sites created and improved some tools, promoted several advanced experiences, improved labor productivity, and reduced costs. The galvanized iron workers at construction site 12 created a rolling machine, increasing efficiency by one time; the carpentry team improved the rabbet saw, increasing efficiency by six times.

Due to the implementation of the quota-based material requisition and return system, the material usage quota was basically controlled, and the workers' enthusiasm for saving materials was improved. The workers were particularly careful in requisitioning and storing materials. Every worker could know every day whether the materials used that day exceeded the quota, thus strengthening the sense of responsibility for saving and ensuring the timely return of materials.

Strictly controlling the budget and final accounts system and controlling expenditure is very important for reducing construction costs. Indirect expenses account for about 15 percent of the project cost, and their overspending or saving has a great impact on the entire project cost. Over the year, most construction sites adhered to the principle of centralized control and decentralized management. In terms of controlling expenditure, the main thing was to strictly implement the approval procedures, improve the budget and final accounts system, and basically overcome the past problem of "approving without reviewing." From the approval of 384 budgets, a total of 37,800 yuan was reduced, accounting for 43 percent of the total approved budget amount. In the implementation of the budget, the company also organized forces to go to various construction sites to check, and if it was found that there was broad budgeting and narrow use, it was corrected. By taking these measures, a total of more than 371,000 yuan was saved in expenditure throughout the year.

Wage expenditure accounts for about 15 percent of the project cost. Therefore, strengthening the management of the wage fund can also reduce costs. Before the start of construction, each construction site fully prepared for the implementation of advanced quotas, and criticized the negative emotions of some cadres who believed that the quotas were high and feared that the workers would not be able to complete them. After the start of construction, each construction site took specific measures to help workers reach and exceed the quotas. For example, at construction sites 12 and 13, the masonry workers initially only completed an average of 50 percent of the quota. After promoting the three-section masonry method and adjusting the labor organization, they exceeded the quota by an average of 50 percent. Because each construction site strengthened labor protection work, there were no work-related fatalities throughout the year, and minor injuries also decreased. This not only ensured the safety of employees' lives, but also greatly reduced non-production expenses.

Strengthening technical management can not only ensure project quality, but also is one of the main conditions for reducing costs. In order to do a good job in project quality, the company focused on criticizing the workers' purely quantity-driven and quality-ignoring thinking during the winter training and learning before the start of construction, and strengthened the work of leading employees to learn drawings and other technical disclosures after the start of construction. In the implementation of operating procedures and quality standards, some necessary systems were established, such as the three-level inspection and one-time acceptance system that was generally promoted at each construction site, and the "standard sample system" established in the carpentry work. Therefore, the role of technical supervision work was brought into play, so that independent inspection and mass inspection were closely combined. Especially in the construction throughout the year, each construction site constantly criticized the tendency to lower quality standards in order to complete the cost reduction plan, so the project quality was significantly improved compared with the past, and rework losses and waste phenomena were greatly reduced.

When cost reduction targets were issued, some leading cadres at the construction sites believed that: the phenomenon of waste in construction could not be overcome, so the cost reduction plan was simply impossible to complete. Some believed that the national targets were raised too much and it was difficult to complete. In short, at the beginning, there was a relatively common lack of confidence in completing the project cost reduction plan. In order to overcome this shortcoming, in May, the company organized a working group composed of managers, engineers, and relevant departments and offices, using construction site 12 as an experiment to explore specific methods for reducing costs and the possible reduction targets. The results proved that the possible reduction targets exceeded the national requirement by 30 percent. This fact educated the cadres and employees, and increased their confidence, enabling the cost reduction work to penetrate into various construction sites and teams.

    我们是怎样超额完成降低建筑成本计划的
    黑龙江省建设厅第三工程公司副经理　魏云
    黑龙江省建设厅第三工程公司全体职工，在上级的正确领导下，在去年的施工中重视了降低成本的工作，建立了各项责任制度，所以在保证质量的前提下，超额完成了降低成本计划，节约的资金占工程总造价的百分之十三点九三。其中节约材料费七十四万二千多元，人工费二十三万多元，行政管理费二万八千多元，工程业务费三十四万多元。
    加强计划管理是推行经济核算制的基础。各工地在开工前按照降低工程成本，保证质量的原则制定了施工措施计划；开工后又及时编制了月、旬的作业计划，把每一个工段，每一个小组，每天能够完成的各项指标，通过计划下达到每个工人，并按照作业计划完成时间，按期公布执行结果。这样就使每个工人完成每一个作业计划时，都能知道自己给国家积累了多少财富，或是浪费了国家多少财富。因此工人们在施工过程中对降低成本工作一般都很重视。如十二工地的各工种小组为了完成小组作业计划，纷纷提出了具体措施：木工小组提出一定要做到量材下料，保证不出废品，并尽量利用碎材，节省成材；瓦工、砌石工提出要做到四净，即灰槽净、砖头用净、砖墙挂的灰刷净、掉地下的灰拣净。搬运工作到垛底不剩碎砖头，挑灰不掉灰，收工后灰槽子不剩灰；混凝土工提出做到不掉灰，不跑浆，不碰坏灰袋纸。水暖电气工提出量材下料，不丢掉零件，不剩管子头等。由于各工种都有具体的措施，同时大部分工地的科室都和工段签订了技术供应联系合同，基本上保证了及时供应材料、劳动力，所以不仅各工地的施工计划按期完成了，而且大部分小组的降低成本计划也完成了。
    加强材料供应计划和运输保管，降低材料损耗定额是降低成本的主要关键。根据黑龙江的情况来看，地方建筑企业经常是任务下达的晚，设计预算不能及时提出，为了减少材料供应的盲目性，公司一方面积极协助建设单位编制预算，一方面按照概算确定材料需要计划，根据这个计划确定货源，研究组织运输力量，然后根据现场配置图预先准备百分之八十的材料。在备料工作上所采取的措施是尽量就地或就近取材，和利用积压的物资；对需要量较多的材料，则组织有生产能力又有可能条件的工地生产或加工。例如十二和十三工地的工程所用的石头、砂子、泥瓦、大五金、水泥管等材料，大部分是工地自己生产或加工供应的。这一措施不但解决了开工前工人因没有活干而窝工等问题，而且保证了材料的及时供应，同时还给国家节约了十五万二千多元（不包括运费节约）的财富。公司在施工中还经常通过平衡会议，研究和检查材料供应计划的完成情况，及时采取适当措施，保证供应计划的实现。公司对材料的保管也很注意，备料工作一开始，就规定好材料堆放位置，平好地面；对大堆材料，实行分号保管的办法，使材料卸在哪里用在哪里，避免了捣堆捣垛的损失，又节省很多运搬费。在材料运输方面，要监装监卸，轻拿轻放。运输水泥等纸袋或草袋包装的材料时，携带预备袋子，遇有破漏可及时更换新袋。由于加强了材料的管理，给国家节约很多资金。如十二工地，由于降低红砖的耗损，共节约红砖十五万九千块；由于降低水泥的耗损，共节省水泥二万五千一百多公斤。
    各工地在保证工程质量的前提下，广泛利用废材代替成材，并设立了木材、钢筋、白铁、铁管等加工厂，实行了集中下料，统一配料，从而减少了材料损耗率，提高了废料利用率。如十二工地利用短木头和旧板材改制鱼鳞窗框等，共节省好木材一百三十五立方公尺，利用钢筋头加工扒锯子，灰流子，蘑菇钉等，共节省好钢筋一千三百六十七公斤。
    在开展劳动竞赛当中，有领导地发动职工积极提合理化建议，推广先进经验，这对降低成本有很重要的意义。公司全体职工全年共提出一百零三件比较重大的合理化建议，经研究采纳的有七十件，节约了大批木材、水泥、钢筋等材料。一年来各工地创造和改进了一些工具，推广了几种先进经验，提高了劳动生产率，降低了成本。十二工地白铁工创造了滚圆机，提高效率一倍；木工组改进裁口锯，提高效率六倍。
    由于实行了限额领料退料制度，基本上控制了材料使用定额，提高了工人节约材料的积极性。工人对领用和保管材料特别细心，每一个工人每天都能知道当天使用的材料是不是超过了定额，因而加强了节约的责任心，并且保证了及时退料。
    严格掌握预算、决算制度，控制经费开支，对于降低建筑成本很为重要。间接费用占工程成本的百分之十五左右，其超支或节约，对整个工程成本影响很大。一年来，大部分工地都坚持了集中掌握、分散管理的原则。在控制开支方面，主要是严格执行批审手续，健全预算决算制度，基本上克服了过去“批而不审”的毛病。从批审三百八十四份预算中，共缩减了三万七千八百元，占批审预算总额的百分之四十三。在预算的执行中，公司又组织力量到各工地去检查，发现有宽打窄用的，即予纠正。采取了这些措施，全年共节约开支三十七万一千多元。
    工资开支占工程造价的百分之十五左右，因此，加强工资基金的管理，也可以降低成本。各工地在开工前充分做好了贯彻先进定额的准备工作，批判了部分干部认为定额高，怕工人完不成的消极情绪。开工后，各工地采取具体措施帮助工人达到和超过定额。如十二、十三工地，开始时砌石工人平均只完成定额的百分之五十，经过了推广三段砌石法和调整劳动组织，就平均超过定额百分之五十。各工地由于加强了劳动保护工作，全年没有发生因工死亡事故，轻伤事故也减少了。这不仅保证职工的生命安全，并且大大减少了非生产开支。
    加强技术管理不仅可以保证工程质量，而且也是降低成本的主要条件之一。为了搞好工程质量，公司在开工前的冬训学习中就有重点地批判了工人思想中的单纯赶数量忽视质量的思想，开工后又加强了领导职工学习图纸等技术交底工作。在贯彻操作规程和质量标准中又建立了一些必要的制度，如各工地普遍推行了三级检查一次验收制，在木工中建立了“标准样品制”。因此就发挥了技术监督工作的作用，使独立检查和群众检查密切结合起来。特别是在全年施工中，各工地不断地批判那种为了完成降低成本计划而降低质量标准的倾向，所以工程质量较过去有了显著提高，返工损失、浪费现象也大为减少。
    在降低成本指标下达时，有的工地领导干部认为：在施工中浪费现象没有办法克服，所以降低成本计划根本就不可能完成。有的则认为国家指标提高太多，很难完成。总之，在开始时，对完成降低工程成本计划缺乏信心，是比较普遍的。为了克服这一缺点，公司在五月份组织了有经理、工程师及有关科、室参加的工作组，以十二工地为试验，摸索降低成本的具体方法和可能降低的指标。结果证明可能降低的指标超过国家要求降低的百分之三十。这个事实教育了干部和职工，提高了他们的信心，使降低成本工作深入到各工地、各小组去。
