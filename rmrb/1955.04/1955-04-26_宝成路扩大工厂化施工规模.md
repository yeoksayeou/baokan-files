    Baocheng Railway Expands Factory Construction Scale
    The Second Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, which is building the new Baocheng Railway, is expanding the scale of factory construction. Various prefabricated components produced by affiliated factories are being transported to the construction site via newly laid tracks. All T-beams exceeding 2.5 meters in length, used for bridge construction, will be prefabricated in cement products factories this year. Last year, most of the railway sleepers were manufactured independently by various counties and construction sites, but this year they will all be centrally manufactured in woodworking factories and then transported to the construction site. This year, a centralized quarry will also be established to supply the stone needed for the section of the project from Lüeyang to Huangsha River.
    In the past, when manufacturing reinforced concrete T-beams on the construction site, the quality of the T-beams varied. The molds could only be used once or twice before being discarded. After centralized manufacturing in factories, each mold can be used an average of more than twenty times, and the quality of the T-beams has also improved.

    宝成路扩大工厂化施工规模
    铁道部新建铁路第二工程局正在宝成铁路扩大工厂化施工规模。由附属工厂制成的各种预制品正经过新铺好的线路源源运到工地。供架桥用的二点五公尺以上的丁字梁，今年已全部由水泥制品厂预先集中制造。铺轨用的枕木，去年大部分是由各县和各工地自行制成成品的，今年将全部集中在制木厂制成成品后再运到工地。今年还将建立一个集中制造料石的采石场，以供应略阳到黄沙河段工程需要的料石。
    过去在工地制造钢筋混凝土丁字梁时，丁字梁的质量时好时坏，模型至多用一两次就扔掉了。在工厂集中制造后，一副模型平均就可以使用二十次以上，丁字梁的质量也有了改进。
