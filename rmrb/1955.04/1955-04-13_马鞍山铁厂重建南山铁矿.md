Ma'anshan Iron Factory is about to complete the reconstruction project of the Nanshan Iron Mine. Currently, tall factory buildings have been completed at the southern foot of Nanshan, and most of the machinery and equipment have been installed. Tens of miles of air pipes, water pipes, and high-voltage and low-voltage transmission lines are crisscrossed underground and in the sky. The railway has reached the foot of Nanshan, and a large number of production workers, production tools, and equipment have been transported to the site.

Now, the workers constructing the Nanshan Iron Mine are stepping up their finishing work, striving to allow the Ma'anshan Iron Factory to use high-quality iron ore to produce more iron as soon as possible.

    马鞍山铁厂重建南山铁矿
    马鞍山铁厂南山铁矿重建工程即将竣工。目前，高大的厂房已经在南山南麓兴建完工，大部机械设备也已安装完毕。数十华里长的风管、水管和高压、低压输电线路，纵横交错地布设在地下和天空。铁路已经通到南山脚下，大批生产工人和生产工具、器材已运抵现场。
    现在，建设南山铁矿的职工们正在加紧进行收尾工程，争取使马鞍山铁厂早日用优良的铁矿石炼出更多的铁来。
