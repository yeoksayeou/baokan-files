    Anshan Iron and Steel held a production technology representatives conference from April 2nd to 6th.
    The meeting studied the situation and problems in the production of Anshan Iron and Steel's various factories and mines. This year's production and capital construction tasks for Anshan Iron and Steel are even more arduous. The total value of production must increase by 22% compared to 1954, and capital construction investment must increase by 86% compared to 1954, in order to produce more varieties and better steel and steel products for the country. However, there are still many problems, such as unbalanced production, failure to complete variety orders on time, low product quality, high rejection rates, numerous accidents, and serious waste. In order to complete and overfulfill this year's production and capital construction plan, the more than 1,700 representatives present, in a spirit of criticism and self-criticism, examined the shortcomings in their work, formulated a technical organization measures plan and an increase production and practice economy task for 1955, and unanimously decided that in 1955, in addition to completing the state plan, they would increase the total value of production for the country by 36.7 million yuan and reduce costs by 10 million yuan.
    On the basis of increased production, Anshan Iron and Steel will build 200,000 square meters of dormitories for employees this year, a new employee hospital, an outpatient clinic, three nurseries, a spare-time university, and two women's health rooms, as well as overhaul more than 45,600 square meters of housing and plant 88,000 trees.

    鞍山钢铁公司在四月二日到六日召开了一九五五年生产技术代表大会。

    在增加生产的基础上，鞍钢今年将为职工修建二十万平方公尺的宿舍，新建一所职工医院，一个门诊部，三个托儿所，一所业余大学，两个妇女卫生室等，并要大修四万五千六百多平方公尺的房屋，植树八万八千棵。　（本报驻鞍山记者）
