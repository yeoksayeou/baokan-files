Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The State Council issued "Instructions on Key Establishment of Radio Stations in Agricultural, Animal Husbandry, and Fishery Production Cooperatives" on March 29th. According to these instructions, 10,000 radio stations will be established nationwide at one time.

The instructions state: In order to strengthen the propaganda for the socialist transformation of agriculture, popularize knowledge of current affairs, politics, and agricultural production techniques, prevent damage to agriculture, animal husbandry, and fisheries from severe weather and tides, and partially meet the cultural and entertainment needs of farmers, it is necessary to establish radio stations in a portion of agricultural, animal husbandry, and fishery production cooperatives that are relatively well-organized and have a relatively large number of households throughout the country. The instructions state: The radios needed to establish 10,000 radio stations will be provided free of charge by the Broadcasting Administration in April 1955; the assignment of radio operators and the maintenance costs of the radios will be resolved by the production cooperatives themselves that are establishing the stations.

The principles for establishing radio stations are: prioritizing advanced areas of mutual aid and cooperation, with appropriate consideration for remote areas; prioritizing agricultural production cooperatives, with appropriate consideration for fishery, forestry, animal husbandry, and vegetable production cooperatives.

The State Council also made clear and specific instructions regarding the allocation of radio stations to each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government, the method of establishing stations, the training of radio operators, radio station repair and service work, and the leadership of radio stations.

The notice states: In order to strengthen patriotic education and policy and current affairs propaganda for the masses in remote provinces and ethnic minority areas, prevent damage to agriculture and animal husbandry from severe weather, and partially meet the cultural and entertainment needs of farmers, 1,500 radios are specially allocated to establish radio stations in Yunnan, Guizhou, Xikang, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Guangxi, Hainan, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
