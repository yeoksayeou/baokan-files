    The Chinese People Will Never Agree
    Jiang Yuanchun
    In a press conference on the 5th, Dulles made a statement on the Taiwan issue, reiterating that the United States would definitely use war to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan and Penghu. He even equated the so-called "obligation to defend Taiwan" with the "obligation to defend the United States of America," as if, in his view, Taiwan had become part of the United States. Despite this, he attempted to portray the United States' blatant aggression and threats against China as maintaining relations with China on a so-called "civilized and peaceful basis," as if the "civilization" of the United States was airplanes, cannons, fleets, and atomic bombs, and the "peace" of the United States was forcing others to tolerate its aggression.
    Dulles also revealed that the United States and some "interested countries" are constantly conducting "very active exchanges of views" in order to achieve a so-called "common attitude" on the Taiwan issue.
    It is clear from Dulles' words that in order to get rid of its isolated position on the issue of forcibly occupying China's territory of Taiwan, the United States is trying its best to win over some of its allies with the trick of so-called "ceasefire" and ask them to share the responsibility for the war with the United States.
    Therefore, people cannot fail to notice a London news item reported by the "New York Times" on March 30. The news said that the British cabinet had discussed "the issue of guaranteeing support for the United States on Taiwan and the Penghu Islands" in the event that the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique withdrew from the coastal islands. The news said that any "guarantee" made by Britain to the United States would be so-called "temporary." During the "guarantee" period, Britain would advocate a so-called "referendum" in Taiwan. On April 2, the British "Manchester Guardian" also reported the same news.
    It is not difficult to see that the United States is trying to drag Britain into its war plan to invade Taiwan. It also wants to use Britain to make some Commonwealth countries fight for the aggressive interests of the United States in forcibly occupying Taiwan.
    However, if Britain really guarantees to support the United States in its occupation of Taiwan as the news says, then it will be in an extremely undignified position. Taiwan is China's territory, and liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair, which does not allow anyone to interfere in any way. Britain's guarantee to support the United States in preventing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan is obviously intending to collude with the United States to interfere in China's internal affairs. It is not difficult to imagine what kind of reaction and consequences such interference will cause.
    It is impossible to deceive people by calling this "guarantee" to support the United States' aggression against Taiwan "temporary." This so-called "guarantee" will essentially constitute a war alliance between Britain and the United States in invading Taiwan. When the United States uses this "guarantee" to drag Britain into the war, what is the meaning of this "temporariness"? If it is said that this "temporariness" lies in the so-called "referendum" in Taiwan advocated by Britain, then this proposition itself is extremely absurd. Taiwan has always been China's territory, and the people of Taiwan are the people of China. Why should a "referendum" be held? If a "referendum" needs to be held in Taiwan, then should a "referendum" also be held on the British islands of Guernsey, Jersey, and Alderney to determine whether they are part of Britain?
    Facts have long proven that the so-called "referendum" is often a means for imperialists to occupy other countries' territories and compete for colonies. Hitler played this trick when he annexed Austria in 1938. It is clear that anyone who advocates a so-called "referendum" in Taiwan is only aiming to create "two Chinas" and legalize the United States' act of occupying Taiwan.
    The "common attitude" that the United States and its followers are discussing and trying to take is actually to unite and threaten the Chinese people with war, forcing the Chinese people to tolerate their use of force and "referendums" to create the fact of forcibly occupying Taiwan. But no matter what means the United States takes, the Chinese people's will to liberate Taiwan will never waver and will never change. The Chinese people will never agree to or recognize the so-called "referendum."

    中国人民决不同意
    蒋元椿
    杜勒斯五日在记者招待会上就台湾问题发表谈话，重申美国一定要用战争来阻挠中国人民解放台湾和澎湖。他甚至把所谓“保卫台湾”的“义务”和“保卫美利坚合众国的义务”并提，好像在他看来，台湾已经成了美国的一部分。虽然如此，他却企图把美国对中国的明目张胆的侵略和威胁，说成是为了把同中国的关系保持在所谓“文明的和平基础”上，似乎美国的“文明”就是飞机、大炮、舰队和原子弹，而美国的“和平”就是迫使别人容忍它的侵略。
    杜勒斯还透露，美国和一些“有利害相关的国家”正在不断进行“非常积极的意见交换工作”，以求得在台湾问题上有一个所谓“共同态度”。
    从杜勒斯这些话可以清楚地看出，美国为了摆脱它在强占中国领土台湾的问题上的孤立地位，正在竭力用所谓“实现停火”的诡计来拉拢它的一些盟国，要它们和美国一起承担战争的责任。
    因此，人们不能不注意到“纽约时报”在三月三十日报道的一个伦敦消息。这个消息说，英国内阁已经讨论了在美国和蒋介石卖国集团撤出沿海岛屿的情况下“保证在台湾和澎湖列岛支持美国的问题”。消息说，英国向美国提出的任何“保证”都将是所谓“暂时性”的。在“保证”期间内，英国将主张在台湾举行所谓“公民投票”。四月二日，英国“曼彻斯特卫报”也报道了同样的消息。
    不难看出：美国在努力把英国拖进它的侵略台湾的战争计划。它并且想经过英国使某些英联邦国家也为美国强占台湾的侵略利益而作战。
    但是，如果英国真像消息所说那样保证支持美国侵占台湾，那末，它就会处在极不体面的地位。台湾是中国的领土，解放台湾是中国的内政，决不容许任何人以任何方式来进行干涉。英国要保证支持美国阻挠中国人民解放台湾，显然就是打算伙同美国来干涉中国内政。不难想像，这样的干涉会引起怎样的反响和后果。
    把这种支持美国侵略台湾的“保证”说成是“暂时性”是不能骗人的。这种所谓“保证”实质上将构成英美在侵略台湾方面的战争联盟。当美国利用这种“保证”而把英国拖进了战争的时候，这种
  “暂时性”又有什么意义呢？如果说，这种“暂时性”就在于据说英国所主张的在台湾举行所谓“公民投票”，那末这种主张本身就是极端荒谬的。台湾从来就是中国的领土，台湾人民是中国的人民，为什么要进行“公民投票”？如果在台湾需要进行 “公民投票”，那末，是否在英国的根赛、泽西和阿德尔尼岛屿上也需要举行一次“公民投票”，来确定它们是不是英国的一部分呢？
    事实早已证明，所谓“公民投票”常常是帝国主义者侵占别国领土和争夺殖民地的一种手段。希特勒在一九三八年并吞奥地利的时候，就玩过这个花样。很清楚，任何人如果主张在台湾举行所谓“公民投票”，其目的不过是为了制造“两个中国”，使美国侵占台湾的行为合法化。
    美国和它的追随者正在商量企图采取的“共同态度”，实际上就是想联合起来对中国人民进行战争威胁，强迫中国人民容忍它们用武力和“公民投票”等手段来造成强占台湾的事实。但是不管美国采取什么手段，中国人民解放台湾的意志决不动摇，决不改变。所谓“公民投票”，中国人民决不同意，也决不承认。
