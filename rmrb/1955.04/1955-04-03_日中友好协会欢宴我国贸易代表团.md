Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 2nd. On the evening of the 1st, the Chinese Trade Delegation to Japan attended a welcome banquet hosted by the Japan-China Friendship Association for people from all walks of life in Japan.

    About 200 people from Japan attended, including prominent public figures and representatives from labor unions, cultural, political, and economic circles.

    Matsumoto Jiichiro, President of the Japan-China Friendship Association, delivered a speech at the banquet, extending a warm welcome to the Chinese Trade Delegation's visit to Japan. He spoke of the Japanese people's desire for peaceful coexistence and friendly relations with China, and expressed the Japanese people's determination to overcome all difficulties and strive for the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan and the defense of peace in Asia.

    Lei Renmin said in his speech: In the short time that the Chinese Trade Delegation has been in Japan, we have already realized that the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan has a solid foundation. Peaceful coexistence and friendly exchanges between China and Japan are not only in the interests of the peoples of China and Japan, but also conducive to peace in the East. Lei Renmin pointed out: Because relations between China and Japan have not yet been normalized, trade and cultural exchanges between the two countries cannot be further developed, which is obviously contrary to the interests and wishes of the Japanese people. The Chinese people are willing to work together with people from all walks of life in Japan who are dedicated to Japan-China friendship to increase the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan and to further develop economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries.

    The banquet was held in a warm and friendly atmosphere.

    Finally, the famous Japanese public figure Ikuo Oyama led the audience in chanting "Long live Japan-China friendship!"

    日中友好协会欢宴我国贸易代表团
    新华社东京二日电　一日晚，中国访问日本贸易代表团出席了由日中友好协会主办的日本各界欢迎宴会。
    日本方面出席的有日本著名的公众领袖和工会、文化、政治、经济等各界代表约二百人。
    日中友好协会会长松本治一郎在席间致词，对中国贸易代表团的访问日本表示热烈的欢迎。他谈到日本人民要求和中国和平共处、友好亲善的愿望，并表示日本人民决心克服一切困难，为中日两国人民的友好和保卫亚洲和平而奋斗。
    雷任民在致词时说：在中国贸易代表团到达日本的短短的时间内，我们已经体会到中日两国人民间的友谊是有深厚基础的。中日两国的和平共处和友好往来不仅符合中日两国人民的利益，而且有利于东方的和平。雷任民指出：由于中日两国间的关系还没有正常化，使得两国间的贸易往来和文化交流不能进一步发展，这显然是违背日本人民的利益和愿望的。中国人民愿与日本致力于日中友好的各界人士为中日两国人民友谊的增长、为两国经济、文化交流的进一步发展而共同努力。
    宴会在热烈、友好的气氛中进行。
    最后，日本著名公众领袖大山郁夫带领全场高呼日中友好万岁。
