The entire Yellow River within the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region thawed on the afternoon of March 29th, and the people of all ethnic groups along the river safely passed the ice flood season. Mongolian and Han farmers enthusiastically began spring plowing. River traffic has resumed, and ships full of goods and passengers have begun to travel back and forth on the rolling eastward-flowing Yellow River. Fishermen hoisted their sails and cast their nets, catching delicious fresh Yellow River carp.

This year, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region began preparations for ice flood prevention earlier, and vigorously organized mass forces for ice flood prevention. Under the slogan of "thoroughly eliminating hidden dangers and reinforcing dikes," all localities comprehensively inspected flood control dams before the river thawed, and launched a campaign to plug rat holes and repair cracks. March 26th to 28th were the most intense days of the ice flood prevention battle, and also the period when huge ice floes from the upper reaches flowed downstream, forming ice bridges and ice dams. In the Yellow River from Urad Front Banner to Togtoh County, a total of thirty ice bridges and ice dams were formed. At this time, tens of thousands of ice flood prevention forces along the river went to the dikes, guarding the dikes day and night. In order to shorten the flood season and avoid ice disasters, the artillery launched a fierce bombardment of eight ice bridges and ice dams that were likely to cause floods, and these obstacles were quickly broken. A huge ice dam formed near Baotou, preventing the river water from flowing, and the water level rose sharply, but the large ice dam was immediately broken by the People's Air Force, and the water level quickly dropped. Although this year's ice flood flow was larger than in previous years, and the water level was also higher than in previous years, the flood control dikes remained intact thanks to the active defense of the people along the river and the support of the People's Air Force and artillery. This ensured the safety of people's lives and property and the country's construction endeavors. (Bai Gele)

    内蒙古境内黄河全部开冻
    内蒙古自治区境内黄河在三月二十九日下午全部开冻，沿河各族人民安全度过了凌汛期。蒙、汉族农民热情地开始了春耕生产。河上交通已经恢复，满载着货物和旅客的船只开始往来于滚滚东流的黄水上。渔民们拉起了舟上的风帆，撒下鱼网，捕捉鲜美的开河鲤鱼。
    今年，内蒙古自治区各地防凌准备工作动手较早，而且大力组织了群众防凌力量。各地在“彻底消除隐患，加固堤防”的口号下，在开河前全面检查了防洪坝，展开了堵鼠洞和补修裂缝运动。三月二十六日到二十八日，是防凌战斗最紧张的日子，也是上游巨大的冰凌顺流而下，集结冰桥、冰坝的时期。从乌拉特前旗到托克托县的黄河中，共结冰桥、冰坝三十座。这时沿河上万人的防凌大军上了堤，日日夜夜防守堤防。为了缩短汛期，避免凌灾，炮兵对足以酿成水灾的八个冰桥、冰坝进行了猛烈的轰击，这些阻碍很快都被击破。包头附近结成巨大冰坝一处，河水不能流泄，水位猛涨，但大冰坝立即被人民空军炸断，水位很快下降。虽然今年凌汛的流量比往年大，水位也比往年高，但在沿河人民的积极防御和在人民空军、炮兵的支援下，防洪堤安然无恙。这就保障了人民生命财产的安全和国家的建设事业。（白歌乐）
