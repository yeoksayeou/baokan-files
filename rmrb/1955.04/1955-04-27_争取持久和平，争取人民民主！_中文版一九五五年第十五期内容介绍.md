The organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" The fifteenth issue of the 1955 Chinese edition has been published.

This issue features an editorial entitled "The People of the World Persist in the Struggle Against the Paris Agreements." The editorial states that after the ratification of the Paris Agreements, not only has a new situation emerged in Europe, but the entire international situation has also undergone fundamental changes. Relations between countries have become more strained, and the danger of a new war has intensified. The ratification of the Paris Agreements does not mean that the mass struggle against the revival of German militarism has come to an end. On the contrary, this struggle will unfold more vigorously. The vast majority of people in Europe and around the world are now actively opposing the conspiracies of the imperialist elements to prepare for a new war. At present, the forces opposing the revival of German militarism are much stronger than the forces supporting the adventurous policy of rearming West Germany. The working class and its parties will be more vigilant, unite all national and patriotic forces in their countries more closely, strive for peace, oppose further deterioration of the international situation, and oppose the revival of German militarism.

This issue publishes many articles commemorating the 85th anniversary of Lenin's birth, including "Implementing Lenin's Great Doctrine on the Worker-Peasant Alliance" by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Romanian People's Republic and Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, "Lenin and the British Working Class" by Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, "Lenin's Theory is Our Guiding Star" by Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, and "Moving Forward Along the Road Indicated by the Great Lenin" by Yu. Tsedenbal, Prime Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic.

The articles in this issue also include "The French People Firmly Oppose the Traitorous Policy" by I. Dumont, Member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, and "A Treaty of Friendly and Fraternal Cooperation" by S. Jędrychowski, Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Polish People's Republic. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    中文版一九五五年第十五期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五五年第十五期中文版已经出版。
    这一期以“全世界人民坚持反对巴黎协定的斗争”为题发表了社论。社论说，巴黎协定批准以后，不仅欧洲出现了新的形势，而且整个国际形势也起了根本的变化。各国之间的关系进一步紧张起来了，新战争的危险加剧了。巴黎协定获得批准，并不是说反对复活德国军国主义的群众斗争就宣告结束。相反，这个斗争将更有力地展开。欧洲和全世界绝大多数人民目前正积极反对帝国主义分子准备新战争的阴谋。现在，反对复活德国军国主义的力量比支持重新武装西德的冒险政策的势力强大得多。工人阶级及其政党将更加提高警惕，把本国一切民族力量和爱国力量更紧密地团结起来，争取和平，反对进一步恶化国际局势、反对复活德国军国主义。
