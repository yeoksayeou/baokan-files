Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 21st (TASS): It was previously reported that on April 4th, the Soviet government, through its representative in Tokyo, stated to the Japanese government that the Soviet government considered it appropriate to choose one of the capitals of the directly relevant countries, namely Tokyo or Moscow, as the location for Soviet-Japanese negotiations.

It is reported that on April 8th, Japanese Ambassador Sawada handed a reply note to the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Sobolev. In the reply note, the Japanese government stated that it hoped the negotiation location would be neither in Japan nor in the Soviet Union, and therefore once again suggested New York as the location for the negotiations.

On April 18th, Sobolev handed a reply note to Japanese Observer to the United Nations Sawada, reiterating the Soviet government's statement of April 4th: It is appropriate to hold the aforementioned negotiations in Tokyo or Moscow, that is, in one of the capitals of the countries concerned.

At the same time, the Soviet note stated that, considering the Japanese government's hope to hold negotiations outside of Japan and the Soviet Union, and noting Prime Minister Hatoyama's statement on April 9th regarding the possibility of holding negotiations in Geneva, the Soviet government is willing to agree to Geneva or London as the location for Soviet-Japanese negotiations.

The Japanese government has not yet responded to the aforementioned note.

    苏联政府再次复照日本政府
    愿同意以日内瓦或伦敦作为苏日谈判地点
    新华社二十二日讯　塔斯社莫斯科二十一日讯：前已报道，四月四日，苏联政府曾通过它驻东京的代表向日本政府声明：苏联政府认为选择直接有关的国家的首都之一，即东京或莫斯科，作为苏日谈判的地点是适宜的。
    据悉，在四月八日，日本大使泽田把一份复照交给苏联驻联合国代表索波列夫，日本政府在复照中声明，日本政府希望谈判地点既不在日本，也不在苏联，因而再次建议以纽约为举行谈判的地点。
    四月十八日，索波列夫把一份复照交给日本驻联合国观察员泽田，重申苏联政府在四月四日的声明：在东京或莫斯科、即有关国家的首都之一举行上述谈判是适宜的。
    同时，苏联照会说，由于考虑到日本政府希望在日本和苏联以外的地方举行谈判，并且注意到鸠山首相四月九日发表的关于在日内瓦举行谈判的可能性的声明，苏联政府愿同意以日内瓦或伦敦作为苏日谈判地点。
    日本政府还没有答复上述照会。
