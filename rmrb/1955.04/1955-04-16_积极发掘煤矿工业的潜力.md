　　Since the beginning of this year, state-owned coal mines across the country have universally launched comprehensive production reform work, carrying out rectification and transformation in production technology, labor organization, and management institutions. The purpose of this work is to further tap the production potential of the coal mining industry, overcome waste and chaos, streamline overlapping institutions, improve work efficiency, and draw out employees to replenish grassroots units or other construction departments. This is an important measure to further develop the coal mining industry.
　　The fundamental problem of China's coal mining industry today is that the speed of production development cannot keep up with the needs of all aspects of the country. During the construction period of the first five-year plan, the state requires a large increase in the production of the coal mining industry. By 1957, the output of raw coal should be 1.7 times higher than in 1952. More than 80 percent of this increased output must be completed by tapping the potential of existing mines. In the past few years, although state-owned coal mines in various places have rectified and reformed the predatory mining methods and technologically backward conditions implemented by foreign capitalism and domestic bureaucratic capitalism in the past, enabling coal mine production to be restored and developed, the proportion of new coal mining methods has increased from 13 percent in 1949 to 79.7 percent in 1954; the proportion of mechanized coal mining has increased from 4.2 percent in 1950 to 33.6 percent in 1954; underground ventilation has largely changed from natural ventilation to mechanical ventilation, and the national output of raw coal in 1954 increased by 2.7 times compared with 1949. However, due to limitations in conditions and experience, the past production reforms were not thorough enough, and the transformation of the backward production technology left over from the old enterprises was even worse. The main production links such as geology, tunneling, coal mining, and underground transportation are unbalanced. Production geology and surveying work are very weak, and the role of guiding and supervising production is far from adequate. At the same time, the organizational management of enterprises is also very unsound, the responsibility system for engineering technology has not been well established, and there is insufficient understanding of the importance of science and technology in industrial production. This has prevented the establishment of a normal production order, and production has been in an unstable state for a long time, and balanced production and safe production are not guaranteed. Especially in the past few years, due to the increase in production tasks, many coal mines have had to rely on shock production to complete tasks, and the more shock production, the more chaotic and passive the work becomes, and the more waste and accidents increase. If the coal mining industry does not comprehensively, systematically, and step-by-step change this passive situation at present and establish a stable and normal production order, it will not be able to adapt to the needs of the country. The comprehensive production reform of state-owned coal mines has been put on the work agenda in a timely manner under these circumstances.
　　The production reform of the coal mining industry was first tested in the Kailuan Coal Mine. The production reform of the Kailuan Coal Mine includes the reconstruction of mine shafts and the improvement of geology, surveying, tunneling, transportation, ventilation, labor organization, and administrative institutions. Among them, special attention was paid to strengthening the balance of geology, surveying, mining, and underground transportation. Because these are the basic links that affect the production of the coal mining industry, and any one of these links lags behind will affect the entire production. In addition, improving the level of coal mining mechanization and improving labor conditions are also important contents of production reform. Only in this way can labor productivity and workers' enthusiasm be further improved. With the development of production reform, it is necessary to further improve the administrative management institutions in order to adapt to the new production requirements. This series of reforms has improved the production situation of the Kailuan Coal Mine. Its experience has now been promoted in the national coal mining industry.
　　The production reform of the coal mining system provides an important experience for further transforming China's original industry and tapping the potential of the original industry. According to the current preliminary estimates, after the production reform, the output of the entire Kailuan Coal Mine area will increase by nearly one time by 1957 compared with 1953. It is not difficult to imagine that if all the mines in the country adopt these improvement measures, they will inevitably increase more wealth for the country. Many industrial enterprises in our country, like the coal mining industry, have not done thorough enough production reform work in the past, and production potential cannot be effectively utilized. This situation is extremely unfavorable to national construction. If all industrial production departments can well summarize their past production reform experience, refer to the practices of coal mining enterprises, and conduct a systematic rectification and reform according to the characteristics of their own enterprises, and comprehensively improve the enterprise production management and production technology level, then the achievements of the existing industrial production in the country will be greater, which is certain.
　　An important experience of this coal mine production reform is that production reform must have an overall plan and long-term plan, that is, comprehensive arrangements and improvements must be made from all major aspects of production work. Coal mine production, like other modern industrial mass production, is a closely connected whole in all aspects; at the same time, due to the different production objects, it has different laws from other industrial production. To improve the level of coal mine production and continuously tap the internal potential of coal mine enterprises, it is necessary to understand its internal connections, master this law, and then make comprehensive and planned arrangements according to this law to establish a solid and normal production order. Only on this basis can the internal potential of the enterprise be continuously utilized to lead coal mine production to prosperity. In the past, the coal mining industry has carried out many production reforms, but at that time, there was insufficient understanding of the regularity of industrial production, and only some problems in production were handled in isolation, attempting to use this method to transform the appearance of coal mine industrial production. As a result, the work often took care of one thing and lost sight of the other, mutually restrained each other, and could not completely solve the problem. According to the experience of actual work in the past few years, the coal mining industry department has clearly realized that to thoroughly improve production, it is impossible to do without comprehensive reform. This time, the comprehensive reform of many coal mines, with various tasks carried out simultaneously, coordinated with each other, and promoted each other, the work progressed rapidly, and many problems that were considered difficult to solve in the past have been quickly progressed or resolved. Of course, the slogan of comprehensive reform, in specific work, should not be understood as advancing at the same pace regardless of priorities, but only to say that there should be an overall plan and long-term plan when arranging work, and to do it in a planned and step-by-step manner on the basis of the overall plan.
　　Another experience of the comprehensive reform of coal mines is to seriously learn from the Soviet Union's experience. The plan for coal mine production reform is actually a comprehensive study of the Soviet plan. This is to comprehensively reform the original backward technology with the Soviet Union's advanced technology; to comprehensively reform the original backward management methods with the Soviet Union's advanced management methods. This is an important development in learning from the Soviet Union in the coal mining industry. In the past, under the help of Soviet experts, the coal mining industry has successively learned a lot of Soviet experience, but these studies are not systematic and comprehensive. The result of this kind of learning often cannot give full play to the greatest effectiveness of the Soviet experience, and sometimes it causes imbalances in the work. Therefore, this learning method can no longer adapt to the needs of today's coal mine production development, and it must be improved, that is, adopt a comprehensive and systematic method of learning from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's advanced technology is an inseparable whole. Only by comprehensively and systematically studying Soviet experience on the basis of systematically studying the actual situation can the Soviet Union's advanced technology play its greatest role. Some people doubt: "Today, our conditions are not exactly the same as those of the Soviet Union. Is it too demanding to learn comprehensively?" The fact of comprehensive production reform of coal mines shows that this concern is unnecessary. In industrial construction, putting our country's backward technology on an advanced foundation, that is, implementing technological transformation, we should fully and systematically learn from the Soviet Union in this regard. Last year, the Ping'an Mine of the Fuxin Mining Bureau in Liaoning Province organized production on the 1-meter layer coal mining face of the first pit in a comprehensive manner according to the Soviet coal mine production management methods, and achieved complete success; under very poor natural conditions, it created the highest record in the national coal mine of comprehensively completing the national plan. This fact shows that comprehensively learning from the Soviet Union is the fundamental way to change the backward situation of China's coal mining industry.
　　Continuously improving production management and giving full play to the potential of existing industry is one of the basic policies of the Party in socialist construction. For a considerable period of time, the task of national economic construction in our country will mainly rely on improving the utilization of existing fixed assets and giving full play to the potential of existing equipment. The production reform of the coal mining industry has the right direction and remarkable results. It is hoped that coal mines across the country will continue to make persistent efforts and strive for greater achievements; it is also hoped that other industrial and mining enterprises will work hard to tap potential and create more wealth for the country!

### 积极发掘煤矿工业的潜力

    积极发掘煤矿工业的潜力
    从今年年初开始，全国国营煤矿普遍展开了全面的生产改革工作，在生产技术、劳动组织和管理机构等方面进行了整顿和改造。这项工作的目的，是为了进一步挖掘煤矿工业的生产潜力，克服浪费和混乱现象，精简重叠机构，提高工作效率，并抽出职工充实基层单位或其他建设部门。这是进一步发展煤矿工业的一个重要措施。
    我国煤矿工业当前的基本问题，就是生产发展的速度赶不上国家各方面的需要。在第一个五年计划建设时期，国家要求煤矿工业的生产有很大的增长。到一九五七年，原煤产量要比一九五二年提高一点七倍。这个增加的产量，有百分之八十以上要依靠旧有矿井挖掘潜力来完成。几年来，各地国营煤矿虽然对过去外国资本主义和国内官僚资本主义所实行的掠夺式的开采方法和技术上十分落后的状况进行了整顿和改革，使煤矿生产得到了恢复和发展，新采煤法的比重已由一九四九年的百分之十三，提高到一九五四年的百分之七十九点七；机械化采煤的比重已由一九五○年的百分之四点二，提高到一九五四年的百分之三十三点六，井下通风大部由自然通风改为机械通风，全国原煤产量一九五四年比一九四九年提高了二点七倍。但是由于条件和经验的限制，过去的生产改革都做得很不彻底，对旧企业遗留下来的落后的生产技术的改造做得更差，地质、掘进、采煤、井上下运输等主要生产环节不平衡，生产地质和测量工作十分薄弱，指导和监督生产的作用还很不够。同时企业的组织管理也很不健全，工程技术的责任制度未很好建立，对科学技术在工业生产中的重要性认识不足，这就使得正常的生产秩序没有建立，生产长期处于不稳定的状态，均衡生产和安全生产没有保证。特别是这几年来由于生产任务加重，许多煤矿就不得不经常依靠突击生产来完成任务，而愈是突击生产，工作也就愈加忙乱被动，浪费和事故也就增多。煤矿工业如果不在目前全面地、有计划地、有步骤地改变上述这种被动局面，建立起稳固正常的生产秩序，就将不能适应国家的需要。国营煤矿的全面生产改革，正是在这种情况下及时地被提到工作日程上来的。
    煤矿工业的生产改革，先是在开滦煤矿试行。开滦煤矿的生产改革，包括矿井改建和地质、测量、掘进、运输、通风、劳动组织以及行政机构等方面的改善。其中又特别重视了加强地质、测量和采掘以及井上下运输工作的平衡。因为这是影响煤矿工业生产的几个基本环节，其中任何一个环节落后了，都会影响整个生产。此外，提高采煤机械化水平和改善劳动条件，也是生产改革的重要内容。因为只有如此才能进一步提高劳动生产率和工人的劳动热情。随着生产改革的发展，又必须进一步改善行政管理机构，才能适应新的生产要求。这一系列的改革，使开滦煤矿的生产情况有了改进。它的经验，现在已在全国煤矿工业中推广了。
    煤矿系统的生产改革，对于进一步改造我国原有工业，发掘原有工业的潜力，提供了一个重要的经验。根据目前初步的估计，生产改革以后，开滦煤矿全矿区的产量到一九五七年将比一九五三年增加近一倍。不难想像，如果全国矿井都采取了这些改进办法，就必然会给国家增加更多的财富。我国的许多工业企业，正如煤矿工业一样，生产改革工作过去都做得不够彻底，生产潜力还不能有效地利用，这种情况对国家建设是极其不利的。如果所有的工业生产部门，都能很好总结自己过去生产改革的经验，参照煤矿企业的做法，根据本企业的特点进行一次系统的整顿和改革，把企业生产管理工作和生产技术水平全面地提高一步，那么，全国现有工业生产的成绩将会更大，这是可以肯定的。
    这次煤矿生产改革的一个重要经验，就是生产改革必须有全盘规划和长远打算，也就是要从生产工作的各个主要方面进行全面的安排和改进。煤矿生产如同其他现代工业的大生产一样，它是各方面紧密联系的一个整体；同时由于生产对象的不同，它又具有着与其他工业生产不同的规律。要提高煤矿生产水平，不断发掘煤矿企业内部的潜力，就必须认识它的内部联系，掌握它的这种规律，然后按照这种规律，作全面有计划的安排，建立起巩固正常的生产秩序。只有在这个基础上，才能不断利用企业内部潜力，把煤矿生产引向繁荣。过去，煤矿工业曾进行过不少次的生产改革，但当时对工业生产的规律性认识不足，只是孤立地处理生产中的一些问题，企图用这种方法来改造煤矿工业生产的面貌，结果工作中往往顾此失彼，互相牵制，并不能彻底解决问题。根据过去几年来实际工作的经验，煤矿工业部门明确认识到要彻底改进生产，不作全面改革是不行的。这次许多煤矿的全面改革，各项工作同时进行，相互配合，相互推动，工作进展很快，许多过去认为很难解决的问题，都迅速获得了进展或解决。当然，全面改革的口号，在具体工作中，不应了解为不分主次，没有重点地齐头并进，而只是说在布置工作的时候要有全盘规划和长远打算，在总规划的基础上有计划有步骤地去做。
    煤矿全面改革的另一个经验，就是要认真学习苏联的经验。煤矿生产改革的方案，实际上就是全面学习苏联的方案。这就是以苏联的先进技术，来全面改革原有的落后技术；以苏联的先进管理方法，来全面改革原有落后的管理方法。这是煤矿工业中学习苏联的一个重要发展。过去煤矿工业在苏联专家帮助之下，曾陆续地学习了不少苏联经验，但这些学习是不系统不全面的。这种学习的结果，往往不能发挥苏联经验的最大效能，有时候反而造成工作中的不平衡，因此这种学习方法，已不能适应今天煤矿生产发展的需要，必须把它提高一步，即采取全面地系统地学习苏联的方法。苏联的先进技术是一个不可分割的整体，只有在系统地研究实际情况的基础上，全面地、有计划地学习苏联经验，才能使苏联先进技术发挥最大的作用。有些人怀疑：“今天我们和苏联的条件不尽相同，全面学习是否要求过高？”煤矿全面生产改革的事实说明，这个顾虑是不必要的。在工业建设上，把我国落后的技术，安放在先进的基础上，即实行技术改造，在这一点上我们完全应该全面系统地学习苏联。去年辽宁省阜新矿务局平安矿在一坑一米层采煤工作面上，全面地按照苏联煤矿生产管理的方法组织生产，结果获得了完满的成功；在自然条件很不好的情况下，创造了全国煤矿中全面完成国家计划的最高纪录。这个事实说明了全面学习苏联乃是改变我国煤矿工业落后状况的根本道路。
    不断地改进生产管理，充分发挥原有工业的潜力，是党在社会主义建设中的基本政策之一。在相当长的一个时期中，我国国民经济建设的任务，主要将依靠改善现有固定资产的利用状况、充分发挥现有设备的潜力来完成。煤矿工业的生产改革，方向是正确的，成效是显著的。希望全国煤矿再接再厉，争取更大的成就；也希望其它工矿企业，努力发掘潜力，为国家创造更多的财富！
