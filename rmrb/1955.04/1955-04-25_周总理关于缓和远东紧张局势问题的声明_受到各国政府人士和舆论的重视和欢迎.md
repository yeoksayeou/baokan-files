Xinhua News Agency, April 24th: According to a Reuters dispatch from London, London diplomatic circles welcome Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the 23rd regarding easing tensions in the Far East and the Taiwan situation.

    A British Foreign Office spokesman said on the 23rd that Premier Zhou's statement was "very interesting."

    London diplomatic circles believe that whether Premier Zhou's statement marks an important step towards a peaceful resolution depends largely on the attitude of the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, April 24th: Paris News: A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said on the 23rd, regarding Premier Zhou Enlai's statement that China is willing to negotiate with the U.S. government to ease tensions in the Far East, particularly in the Taiwan area, that France adopts a "cautiously optimistic attitude" towards this statement. The spokesman added that France is pleased with anything that can bring about a relaxation of world tensions.

Xinhua News Agency, April 24th: Washington News: The statement made by Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China at the Asian-African Conference, regarding the Chinese government's willingness to negotiate with the U.S. government to ease tensions in the Far East, particularly in the Taiwan area, has attracted great attention from American newspapers. All radio stations and news agencies immediately broadcast the full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's statement. Newspapers published the statement with large headlines.

    Premier Zhou Enlai's statement has aroused different reactions among American leaders. According to a United Press Washington report, Senator Knowland, the Republican leader of the Senate, said that China's proposal was "completely unacceptable," while Senator George, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Democrat, said, "Zhou Enlai's statement is excellent" and the United States should accept it.

    The U.S. State Department issued a statement after consulting with President Eisenhower. The statement avoided explicitly stating whether it was willing to negotiate with the People's Republic of China, but it then put forward a series of unreasonable preconditions, namely: that the representatives of the bandit Chiang Kai-shek participate in any negotiations regarding the Taiwan area; that the so-called "ceasefire" in the Taiwan area be implemented immediately; that American spies convicted by the Chinese government according to law be released immediately; and that the invitation of the United Nations Security Council to discuss New Zealand's proposal to interfere in China's internal affairs be accepted. It is known that the government of the People's Republic of China has clearly stated its firm position on these issues in previous relevant statements.

    周总理关于缓和远东紧张局势问题的声明
    受到各国政府人士和舆论的重视和欢迎
    新华社二十四日讯　据路透社伦敦消息，伦敦外交界人士欢迎周恩来总理二十三日关于缓和远东紧张局势和台湾紧张局势问题的声明。
    英国外交部发言人在二十三日说，周总理的声明是“很令人感兴趣的”。
    伦敦外交界人士认为，周总理的声明是否标志着和平解决的一个重要步骤，在很大程度上还要看美国的态度。
    新华社二十四日讯　巴黎消息：法国外交部发言人二十三日在谈到周恩来总理关于中国愿意同美国政府谈判缓和远东紧张局势问题，特别是缓和台湾地区紧张局势问题的声明时说：法国对于这个声明采取“审慎的乐观态度”。发言人又说，法国对于任何能给世界紧张局势带来缓和的东西，都是喜欢的。
    新华社二十四日讯　华盛顿消息：中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来在亚非会议上发表的关于中国政府愿意同美国政府谈判和缓远东紧张局势问题、特别是和缓台湾地区的紧张局势问题的声明，引起美国报纸的极大注意。所有的电台和通讯社都立刻广播了周恩来总理声明的全文。各报纸都以大标题刊载了这一声明。
    周恩来总理的声明在美国领导人物中间引起了不同的反应。据合众社华盛顿消息说，参议院共和党的领袖诺兰说，中国的建议是“完全不能接受的”，而参议院外交委员会主席、民主党人乔治则说，“周恩来的声明是出色的”，美国应该予以接受。
    美国国务院在同艾森豪威尔总统商量以后发表了一项声明。声明避开明确表示是否愿意同中华人民共和国谈判，但是它接着就提出了一系列的无理的先决条件，即：在任何关于台湾地区的谈判中要有蒋贼的代表参加；立即实现台湾地区的所谓“停火”；立即释放被中国政府依法判刑的美国间谍罪犯；接受联合国安全理事会的关于讨论新西兰的干涉中国内政的建议的邀请。人们知道，对于这些问题，中华人民共和国政府在前此的历次有关声明中已经明确地申明了自己的坚定的立场。
