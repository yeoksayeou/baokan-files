Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 4th: The Chinese trade delegation to Japan was invited to attend a welcome symposium held by the Japanese Diet Members' League for Promoting Sino-Japanese Trade on the afternoon of the 4th.

    The symposium was held in the House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet. Those present included Speaker of the House of Representatives, Masutani Hideji, Vice-Speaker Sugiyama Genjiro, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Sonoda Sunao, and from the Democratic Party, Ikeda Masanosuke and Kita Reikichi; from the Liberal Party, Yamaguchi Kikuichiro and Ishizaka Toyoichi; from the Left-wing Socialist Party, Sata Tadataka and Hoashi Kei; from the Right-wing Socialist Party, Nakamura Koichi and Kono Mitsu; from the Labor-Farmer Party, Kubota Yutaka and Hori Makoto; and from the Communist Party, Sudo Goro, totaling about fifty people.

    In his welcoming speech, Masutani Hideji first welcomed the Chinese trade delegation to the symposium and expressed his gratitude for the warm reception the Japanese Diet members' delegation received when they visited China last year. He said: Sino-Japanese trade has a bright future. Promoting Sino-Japanese trade is a contribution not only to the peace of China and Japan but also to world peace. He also hoped that the Chinese trade delegation would convey the results of their visit to various parts of Japan to the Chinese people and further promote trade between China and Japan.

    Gengo Kinoshita, a member of the House of Councillors and director of the Japanese Diet Members' League for Promoting Sino-Japanese Trade, delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of Vice-President of the House of Councillors, Shigemune Yuzo, who was unable to attend due to illness, expressing the urgent need to promote the development of trade between China and Japan and, on this basis, to seek peace and well-being for the two countries. This is the most urgent matter at present. To achieve this goal, he hoped that the Chinese side would provide great assistance and understanding.

    In his speech, head of delegation Lei Renmin expressed his respect for the efforts of the Japanese Diet Members' League for Promoting Sino-Japanese Trade and pointed out that Sino-Japanese trade has fully favorable conditions. Lei Renmin said: The current obstacle to Sino-Japanese trade is not that Japan lacks goods for export, but that many things are not being exported. If this situation does not change, trade cannot develop fully and substantially, which is first and foremost detrimental to Japan.

    Lei Renmin emphasized that because the Japanese government does not assume the responsibilities and obligations it should, the implementation of limited trade agreements between non-governmental organizations in China and Japan is difficult and has no guarantee. Lei Renmin welcomed the recent talks by Prime Minister Hatoyama, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, and Minister of International Trade and Industry Ishibashi on improving trade with China and the Soviet Union and normalizing relations between Japan and China and the Soviet Union. Lei Renmin said: Realizing these words will bring good results to this trade negotiation, Sino-Japanese trade will be fully developed, and it will also meet the wishes of the people of both countries.

    At the meeting, Ikeda Masanosuke informed head of delegation Lei Renmin of the resolution just passed by the Japanese Diet Members' League for Promoting Sino-Japanese Trade, regarding the request for Japan and the People's Republic of China to establish permanent trade agencies and commodity exhibitions in each other's countries. Head of delegation Lei Renmin said: We hope that an effective and powerful permanent trade agency can be established quickly.

    After the meeting, the delegation also visited the Japanese Diet building.

    欢迎我国访问日本贸易代表团
    日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟举行座谈会
    新华社东京四日电　中国访问日本贸易代表团在四日下午应邀出席了由日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟主办的欢迎座谈会。
    座谈会在日本国会众议院举行。到会的有众议院议长益谷秀次、副议长杉山元治郎、外务省次官园田直和民主党的池田正之辅、北昤吉，自由党的山口喜久一郎、石坂丰一，左派社会党的佐多忠隆、帆足计，右派社会党的中村高一、河野密，劳农党的久保田丰、堀真琴以及共产党的须藤五郎等约五十多人。
    益谷秀次在致欢迎词时首先对中国贸易代表团出席座谈会表示欢迎，并对去年日本国会议员访华团访问中国时受到的热烈招待表示感谢。他说：中日两国的贸易有着光明的前途。促进中日贸易不但对中日两国的和平而且对世界和平都是一种贡献。他并且希望中国贸易代表团能将这次到日本各地参观的结果传达给中国人民，更进一步促进中日两国的贸易。
    参议院议员、日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟理事木下源吾代表因病未能出席的参议院副议长重宗雄三致祝词，表示迫切需要促进中日两国贸易的发展，并在此基础上求得中日两国的和平和福祉。这是当前最紧要的事。为了达到这一目的，希望中国方面能给予大的援助和谅解。
    雷任民团长在致词中对日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟对于促进日中贸易的努力表示敬意，并且指出中日两国贸易具备着充分有利的条件。雷任民说：当前中日贸易的障碍并不是日本没有可以出口的物资，而是有许多东西不出口。这种情况不改变，贸易就不能充分大量的发展，这首先是对日本不利的。
    雷任民着重指出：由于日本政府不承担应该承担的责任和义务，从而使中日两国民间团体的有限的贸易协定的执行遭到困难而没有保障。雷任民对最近鸠山首相、重光外务相、石桥通商产业相发表的改进同中苏两国的贸易以及使日本同中苏两国的关系正常化的谈话表示欢迎。雷任民说：实现这些话就会给这次贸易商谈带来良好的结果，中日贸易就会得到充分的发展，也能符合两国人民的愿望。
    会上，池田正之辅把日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟刚刚通过的关于要求日本和中华人民共和国互设贸易常设机构和商品展览会的决议，告诉了雷任民团长。雷任民团长说：我们希望一个有效的、有权力的贸易常设机构能够迅速地设立。
    会后，代表团还参观了日本国会的建筑。
