Rigorously Practice Economy and Oppose Waste in Capital Construction!

    A Severely Wasteful Building
    Ji Yin
    The office building of the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry is one of the most wasteful buildings in Beijing's capital construction. It is a four-story building with two wings and a six-story central section. Approved by the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the construction area is 9,236 square meters, and the total project cost is 1,847,200 yuan. This investment plan was already very high. However, after completion, the project expenditure exceeded the original budget by more than 288,400 yuan, exceeding the construction area approved by the ministry by 1,049 square meters, and the funds exceeded the plan by 223,900 yuan. The design budget cost was 173 yuan per square meter, but the construction result was 201 yuan per square meter. In addition, materials worth more than 438,000 yuan were stockpiled. The overspent money was not approved by the ministry and has not yet been settled, so it has to be subsidized by other funds from the bureau.

    Blindly pursuing the so-called "national form," which is essentially archaism, has caused huge waste in this building and made the shape of this state organ's office building ugly.

    The office building of the Coal Mine Management Bureau was designed in 1953. The engineer in charge of the design was Yang Weiqiao from the Basic Construction Department of the bureau. He obtained the design drawing by browsing foreign magazines. Finally, he saw a picture of a Western-style building in a pictorial: a rectangular box with large glass windows, the main building one story higher than the sides, also with a large piece of glass. He decided to adopt this Western-style building, and it was also praised by the leaders of the Coal Mine Bureau at that time. The facade shape of this building completely and rigidly uses the architectural image of structuralism. It is obviously completely unsuitable for building the office building of our national organs. After the design drawings were sent to the Beijing Urban Planning Commission for review, they were not approved. The Urban Planning Commission pointed out its shortcomings and asked the Coal Mine Bureau to redesign it.

    The Beijing Urban Planning Commission was completely correct in not approving the original design, but they did not put forward clear and specific opinions on how to reflect the national form in the architecture. Later, engineer Yang Weiqiao went three times to consult a certain "authority" who studied the national form. This "authority" gave him some drawings of pavilions and a sketch. Yang Weiqiao modified the original design according to his opinions, rigidly attaching those antique pavilions and towers to this Western-style building.

    Now, let's take a look at this "national form" building: The entire structure of the house is a square box, surrounded by large glass steel windows, but on the original flat roof, three hip roofs are very incongruously installed, one on each of the left and right sides, and a double-eaved one on the central main building; the large roof is covered with glazed tiles worth more than 40,000 yuan, and the highly raised eaves are lined with glazed pigeons. These expensive pigeons have lost their due shape and become strange-looking birds; under the roof are rows of red and green beams, brackets, etc. These useless decorations are all made of concrete, but they are painted with various colors; between the three roofs, there is a long row of parapet walls, also covered with green glazed tiles, with a strange-looking pigeon standing at one end of the wall; there are eight striking vermilion pillars on both sides of the building, and two rows of fake stone railings - in fact, they are all half-models pasted on the wall with cement. Under the main building's roof, there are three floors of balconies, concrete carved railings, and green glazed pigeons guarding both sides. Further down is the main entrance. On the Sumeru pedestal, two layers of cement railings carved with various ancient patterns such as drum stones are built around a platform. In the middle of the front steps is a "royal road" carved with clouds and pigeons (this kind of "royal road" is most common in the Forbidden City in Beijing). People step on the steps, facing four ancient-style doors painted brightly on the second floor. The lintels of the doors are painted with various red and green paintings. Entering the door, there are four light yellow pillars, and the ceiling is painted with colorful caissons and hung with eight ancient palace lanterns... In short, all these so-called "national form" decorations are awkwardly and forcibly imposed on this building, adding a heavy burden to the building and making it ugly. And 72,000 yuan was wasted, which could build about 1,000 square meters of staff quarters.

    From the very beginning of construction, the leaders of the Coal Mine Bureau did not firmly guide their work with the concept of economy. They did not instruct the designers to make several design plans at the same time for various comparisons, so as to save more money for the country. They made decisions rashly and overturned them rashly. The work changed again and again, from being built in the city to being built outside the city; from being a Western-style building to a "national form," which caused a series of confusion and waste. For example, a auditorium was originally to be built, but later it was not built, resulting in the installation of two more boilers, wasting 10,000 yuan. Originally built in the city, but later changed to outside the city, the original design was completely invalidated, wasting 68 days, 4,800 man-hours, and many expenses. Many materials that had been ordered could not be used. The reason for the change was not to save money, but how to build the house as large and luxurious as possible.

    The designers are of course also responsible. How to implement the spirit of eliminating waste and practicing economy in architectural engineering must start from the design. But the designer of this project did not do this. A four-story house could have been built with a mixed structure, but a reinforced concrete structure was used, resulting in an additional cost of 40,000 yuan. For example, the designer did not seriously consider it beforehand and rashly designed the boiler room in the basement. After construction, it was found that the height of the basement was not enough and the ventilation was poor, so it had to be moved outdoors, increasing the cost by 18,000 yuan and occupying an additional 150 square meters of land. The designed boiler room is still very unreasonable. It often needs to be drained during the rainy season, otherwise the boiler room is in danger of being flooded.

    In many places, our builders (including the Coal Mine Bureau and the Engineering Company) are very irresponsible for state property and excessively extravagant. It was already possible to use bricks from Beijing for the building, but they wanted to use machine-made bricks from the Kailuan Coal Mine Brick Factory. Because the bricks were heavy, the foundation and structure had to be enlarged, which wasted 40,000 yuan. The consumption of building materials was even more alarming. The loss of six thousand yuan was simply because the formwork was not used reasonably and was thrown around everywhere. More than 46,000 kilograms of wood were stolen and burned, and more than 1,600 pit props "disappeared." Cement was wasted by 600 tons due to prolonged storage, reduced quality, and unreasonable application. The loss rate of glass exceeded 43% because the material size was unsuitable and large materials were used for small purposes. Such examples are countless in this project.

    Due to the lack of a concept of economy among the leaders of the engineering company, the entire work was poorly organized, and this project wasted 36,100 man-days in labor, costing 72,500 yuan in wages.

    More seriously, they violated national financial regulations and turned more than 2,500 square meters of temporary sheds into semi-permanent buildings with brick and wood structures, spending an additional 100,860 yuan. The temporary clinic on the construction site also took the opportunity to buy microscopes, sun lamps, electric refrigerators, and a complete set of laboratory equipment, resembling a small hospital.

    Having spent so much state funds, the quality of this building should be very good! But the fact is not so. The poor quality of this building is as shocking as the waste. I visited this building not long ago. On the surface, everything was shiny, but a closer inspection revealed many flaws. There are 426 pillars in the entire building, of which 91 pillars are skewed, bent, broken, honeycombed, and have bald edges and exposed tendons. Some pillars are slanted by more than 12 centimeters, so they have to be plastered with a lot of cement. There are cracks everywhere on the walls and floors, steel bars are exposed at the joints of the stairs, and some rooms are already leaking when it rains. The quality of the concrete floor slabs in the building is also very bad. The concrete floor in some rooms has peeled off, and concrete powder flies everywhere when people walk. Such a building, which has consumed a huge amount of state funds, has reached this point in less than ten months after completion.

    We all know that the country is now carrying out socialist construction, and funds are one of the fundamental factors related to the speed of construction. Today, is it tolerable to waste valuable funds in large quantities?

    Now is the time to completely stop this wrong behavior.

    一座严重浪费的建筑
    季音
    燃料工业部煤矿管理总局办公大楼，是北京基本建设中浪费严重的建筑物之一。它是一座两翼四层中央六层的楼房，经燃料工业部批准，建筑面积为九千二百三十六平方公尺，工程总造价为一百八十四万七千二百元，这个投资计划已经是很高了。但是建成后，工程支出超过原预算二十八万八千四百多元，超过部里批准的建筑面积一千零四十九平方公尺，资金超过计划二十二万三千九百元。设计预算每平方公尺的造价是一百七十三元，但施工结果每平方公尺造价达二百零一元。并且还积压了器材合四十三万八千多元。超支的钱，部里不批准，至今仍没有着落，只得用局里其他的资金垫补。
    盲目追求实质上是复古主义的所谓“民族形式”，使这幢建筑物造成了巨大的浪费，并且使这座国家机关办公大楼的形状丑陋不堪。
    煤矿管理总局的这座办公大楼，是一九五三年开始设计的，负责设计的是总局基本建设处的工程师杨为乔。他取得设计图的方法是翻阅外国杂志，最后在一本画报上看到了一幢西式建筑物的图片：长方形的方框子，一式的大玻璃窗，主楼比两旁高一层，也是一片大玻璃。他决定采用这座西式建筑，并且也得到了当时煤矿总局领导人的赞许。这座建筑物的立面形状，完全是生硬搬用结构主义的建筑形象，用来建筑我国国家机关的办公大楼，显然是完全不适合的。设计图样送到北京市都市计划委员会审查后，没有得到批准。都市计划委员会指出了它的缺点，要煤矿总局重新设计。
    北京都市计划委员会不批准原来的设计是完全正确的，但是他们在建筑中如何体现民族形式上，却没有提出明确而具体的意见。以后，工程师杨为乔先后三次去请教研究民族形式的某“权威”，这位“权威”给了他一些亭台楼阁的图样和一张草图，杨为乔就根据他的意见，修改了原设计，生硬地在这幢西式建筑的身上，安上了那些古色古香的亭台楼阁。
    现在，就来看一下这座“民族形式”的建筑吧：房子整个的结构是方盒子，四周围是一式的大玻璃钢窗，但是在原来的平顶上，却被十分不调和地安上了三个歇山式的大屋顶，左右两边各一个，中间主楼上是个重檐；大屋顶上覆盖了价值四万多元的琉璃瓦，高高翘起的飞檐两端是一排琉璃制的鸽子，这些价钱昂贵的鸽子都失去了应有的形状，变成了四不像的飞禽；屋顶下是一排排红红绿绿的梁头、斗拱等等，这些一无用处的装饰都是混凝土做的，可是却被涂上了各种油彩；在三个屋顶之间，是一长排女儿墙，也覆盖着绿色琉璃瓦，墙的一端都伫立着一只四不像的鸽子；大楼两旁有八根触目的朱红柱子，以及两排假的石栏杆，——实际上它们都是用水泥贴在墙上的半边模型。主楼大屋顶下边，是上下三层的阳台，水泥做的雕花栏杆，绿色的琉璃鸽守卫在两旁。再往下，就是大门口了。在须弥座上筑起了两层雕着抱鼓石等各种古式花样的水泥栏杆，围着一个平台，正面台阶中间是一条雕刻着云彩、鸽子的“御路”（这种“御路”在北京故宫里最多），人们踏上台阶，迎面是二层的四扇被油漆得发亮的古式大门，门的额枋上描画着各式红绿彩画，进门是四根淡黄色的大柱子，天花板上描着五彩的藻井，悬挂着八盏古式宫灯，……总之，所有这一切所谓“民族形式”的装饰，都是拙笨地被生搬硬套地强加在这座建筑物上的，使建筑物增加沉重的负担，并使它丑化。而且浪费掉七万二千元，这笔钱可以建造一千平方公尺左右的职工宿舍。
    煤矿总局的领导人从建筑一开始，就没有牢固地以节约的观念指导工作。他们没有责成设计者同时做出几个设计方案，进行多方面的比较，以便力求为国家多省下一些钱。他们草率地做决定，又草率地推翻，工作中一变再变，从原来建筑在城内，变到了城外；从原来是西式建筑，变到了“民族形式”，这就引起了一系列的混乱和浪费。例如原来要修建礼堂，后来又不修建了，结果多安装了二台锅炉，浪费了一万元。原来建筑在城里，后来又变到城外，原设计全部作废，浪费了六十八天，四千八百工时和许多费用，已订好的许多材料不能使用了。其所以变并不是想节约，而是如何尽量把房子造得更大，更华丽。
    设计者当然也有责任。建筑工程中如何贯彻杜绝浪费厉行节约的精神，首先要从设计中做起。但是这个工程的设计者没有做到这一点，本来四层的房子完全可以用混合结构，但是这里采用了钢筋混凝土结构，结果多费了四万元。又如设计者事先没有认真的考虑，就草率地把锅炉房设计在地下室里。施工后发现地下室高度不够，通风不良，只好又移建到室外，增加造价一万八千元，多占地一百五十平方公尺。现在设计的锅炉房仍然很不合理，多雨的季节经常要排水，否则锅炉房就有被淹的危险。
    在许多地方，我们的建筑者（包括煤矿总局和工程公司）对国家财产很不负责，过份铺张。建筑物原来用北京的砖已很可以了，可是他们要用开滦煤矿制砖厂出的机制砖，因为砖重，不得不加大基础和结构，只此一项就浪费了四万元。建筑材料的消耗更是惊人，仅仅因为模板不合理使用，到处乱丢，就损失六万元。四万六千多公斤的木材被偷烧了，一千六百多根坑木“失踪”了。水泥因为积压过久，质量降低，以及不合理的施用，浪费了六百吨。玻璃由于材料尺寸不合，大材小用，损耗率竟超过百分之四十三。这类例子，在这个工程中是举不胜举的。
    由于工程公司领导人缺乏节约的观念，整个工作组织得不好，这个工程在劳动力上浪费了三万六千一百个工，耗费工资七万二千五百元。
    更严重的是他们违反国家财政制度，把二千五百多平方公尺的临时工棚盖成了砖木结构的半永久性建筑，多花了十万零八百六十元。工地上的临时医疗所，也趁机买了显微镜、太阳灯、电气冰箱以及全套的化验设备，俨然成了一座小医院。
    耗费了这么多国家资金，这座建筑物的质量应该很好了吧！但事实不然。这座建筑物质量的低劣，和浪费同样的使人吃惊。不久前我去参观了这座大楼，从表面上看，一切都油光闪亮，但仔细检查，就破绽百出。大楼全部的柱子有四百二十六根，其中歪斜、弯筋、打断、窝洞，及秃边露筋的柱子，竟有九十一根，有的柱子已斜出十二公分多，只好用大量水泥把它糊起来。墙上，地上，到处都是裂缝，楼梯接岔处露出了钢筋，下雨时有的屋子里已漏水。楼内的混凝土楼板质量也很坏，有些房间的混凝土地面已经破皮，人一走动，混凝土粉末就到处飞扬。这样一座耗费了国家巨量资金的建筑物，竣工不到十个月，竟已到了这等模样。
    我们都知道，现在国家正在进行着社会主义建设，资金，乃是关系着建设速度的根本因素之一。今天，大量地浪费宝贵的资金，难道是可以容忍的吗？
    现在，是到了彻底停止这种错误行为的时候了。
