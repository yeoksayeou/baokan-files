The following is an article by the Ambassador of the People's Republic of Hungary to China: Sikeladan

In the hearts of the Hungarian people, no day is more deeply imprinted than April 4, 1945—the glorious festival of Hungary's liberation. Hungarian history has many pages. On its most brilliant page, our people record this day: after a long era of oppression, our country finally became a free and independent nation, where the people are masters of their free homeland forever.

During the long period of oppression, the Hungarian people made repeated efforts to break free from their shackles and gain the freedom and independence of their homeland. Unfortunately, these efforts only yielded temporary results. The glorious deeds of Taisza, Kossuth, Petofi, and many others demonstrated how much they and the Hungarian people loved freedom.

It was the glorious Soviet army that brought us eternal freedom on April 4, 1945, as they drove the fascist invaders from the entire territory of Hungary.

Our people have always looked upon the Soviet Union, which is building socialism, with great sympathy. After it brought us freedom and unlocked the shackles on our hands, the Soviet Union will forever remain in our hearts.

Only those who have suffered the pain of oppression and fought for freedom can truly understand how much freedom means to the Hungarian workers. In the twenty-five years before liberation, Hungarian workers endured all kinds of white terror and the pain of oppression and exploitation. The rights of the people were trampled upon by the gendarmes. Fate offered them the whip, not bread. The ruling institutions were often in crisis, and the working people had to endure the hardships brought about by these crises.

In 1930, there were more than 200,000 unemployed and semi-unemployed people in industry, and 500,000 to 600,000 unemployed people in agriculture. Girls aged thirteen to fourteen worked twelve hours a day for a meager wage of sixteen to twenty fillers (an old Hungarian currency). The eight-hour work system was not legally guaranteed. Thousands upon thousands of families lived in slums and shantytowns. Between 1928 and 1934, the wages of agricultural workers fell by 56 percent. Due to the tyranny of money lenders and rich peasants, tens of thousands of peasants were subjected to extreme exploitation. The money lenders mercilessly took even the peasants' pillows, or auctioned off their small plots of land and houses. Small craftsmen and vendors were treated no better. The number of bankruptcies tripled. In 1933, 2,500 teachers lost their jobs, while there was an urgent need for teachers, as many rural areas did not even have schools. In 1929, young engineers hired for seven years received a salary of only forty fillers per hour, an amount insufficient even to sustain themselves. Budapest had 70,000 poor households. The birth rate continued to decline, while the death rate continued to rise.

The bourgeoisie pursued profits by all means, turning the country into a graveyard. Between 1925 and 1929, the profits of industrial capitalists increased by 95 percent. In old Hungary, 38 percent of the agricultural population was completely landless, and most only owned one to five holds of land (one hold is approximately equal to nine mu). At that time, Prince Festetics owned 96,122 holds of land, spread across thirty-three villages. Prince Paul Esterhazy owned 222,240 holds, spread across one hundred and sixty-two villages. The Catholic Church owned hundreds of thousands of acres of land, while three million impoverished peasants did not even have a foothold.

I could continue to list the evils of this criminal rule, but that is not my purpose. I recall the past only to demonstrate what a wicked old social system it was, how it led our country to ruin, and how it was finally crushed by the invincible army of the Soviet Union.

A brand new country is being built, replacing this bad system. The liberated people are building a happy socialist country. In this country, people have become the most valuable asset, labor has become a glorious and heroic undertaking, and the right to work and rest is guaranteed by law. There is no exploitation, no poverty; there is only a great goal, for which everyone works hard and continuously builds a free country and a happy life for the workers.

Let us examine how the Hungarian people live and work today, and how they utilize the various opportunities offered by freedom since liberation.

In political life, the starting point of our achievements is that our people have entrusted the leadership of the country to the Hungarian Communist Party. This itself is a guarantee that everything in Hungary serves progress and the interests of the working people. The Hungarian Communist Party has striven to ensure that Hungary forever severs ties with imperialism, thereby thwarting the Hungarian bourgeoisie's conspiracy to launch a civil war. A struggle was waged to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. This was a major blow to American and British imperialism, just as our party's struggle dealt a decisive blow to the old ruling class. The implementation of the Hungarian Communist Party's program is supported by progressive parties, because they know that this program is in line with the interests of the working people and the entire country. The parties that make up the National Independence Front recognize the leading role of the Hungarian Communist Party—this is due to its uncompromising and consistent anti-fascist struggle during the underground work years before liberation. In the program formulated during the war, the Hungarian Communist Party announced the proposition of uniting all patriotic forces, and it realized it. With the help of these forces, as we all know, this program was finally fully implemented. This struggle was not easy. For example, to eliminate the fascist elements in the state institutions, to hand over the war criminals to the people's courts for trial, to prepare the land reform plan and the steps for implementation, to place the monopoly enterprises and large banks under state supervision, to nationalize the mines, and so on. But our party excellently led this struggle. Therefore, it was able to satisfy the wishes of our working people and enhance the party's prestige and reputation. From this, it can be seen that the meaning of people's democracy is struggle. Who would win in this struggle was not very obvious at the time.

Hungary's international prestige has also been enhanced due to the following facts: The Soviet Union was the first to recognize the Hungarian government, and as early as January 20, 1945, it signed a truce agreement with our country in Moscow. The Soviet Union supported us in various ways, giving Budapest some trucks, large quantities of food, and window glass. It successively returned the factories requisitioned by the Soviet army. It also signed the first Soviet-Hungarian barter agreement, which greatly helped our country's reconstruction work.

Hungary was riddled with holes when it was first liberated. The war destroyed 45 percent of the national wealth and 30 to 35 percent of industrial products. Only 10 percent of the factories remained able to operate. More than 20 percent of agricultural implements and half of the livestock were lost. 38 percent of industrial and mining enterprises, 18 percent of houses, 70 percent of locomotives, and 80 percent of freight cars were destroyed. Almost all bridges were destroyed. 168,000 tons of machine tools, textiles and leather goods, medicines, postal and railway equipment were all robbed by the Germans. But the most heartbreaking thing is that the fascist war caused our country to lose 400,000 lives. This is the tragic legacy left by the fascists.

However, our people did not lose heart. They bravely stood on the ruins and announced our party's slogan: Hungary will be rebuilt. This has been gradually realized. We quickly restored our railways and bridges. In addition to rebuilding our factories, we also built thousands of houses, distributed land, implemented currency reform, and started planned economy. The stable currency measures implemented on August 1, 1946, eliminated the chaos in our economic life. With the issuance of the new currency, industrial production began to increase rapidly, and at the same time, this effectively maintained the stability of the currency value. On the reliable basis of stable currency value, we began to implement the Three-Year Plan from August 1947, the purpose of this plan was to rebuild our country, rebuild and develop Hungary's manufacturing industry. Our manufacturing industry greatly exceeded the original goals of the Three-Year Plan in two years and five months. The production volume of the manufacturing industry had already exceeded the level of 1938 as early as 1949. The successful implementation of the Three-Year Plan has enabled the People's Republic of Hungary to be strengthened politically and economically, thereby being able to begin to realize national industrialization.

On January 1, 1950, according to the proposal of our party, our country began the Five-Year Plan to make Hungary an industrial country with advanced agriculture. According to the plan, our industry developed rapidly. In 1953, the output of our manufacturing industry was almost three and a half times that of 1938. This huge increase is impossible in capitalist countries with deep crises. The industrial production of capitalist countries, from the frequent situation, even if there is a slight increase, it is not the result of continuous development, but our Hungarian industrial production is a straight upward line.

It can also be seen from the average increase rate of industrial production in the past few years that socialist industrialization is superior to capitalist industrialization. Between 1949 and 1953, the average annual increase rate of the manufacturing industry was 25 percent in Hungary, 7.27 percent in Austria, 9.45 percent in Italy, 2.96 percent in Belgium, and 6.55 percent in the Netherlands. During the Five-Year Plan, the manufacturing industry, which was strengthened by many newly built enterprises, developed rapidly, indicating that Hungary has become an industrial country. The production volume of the most important basic materials greatly exceeded the maximum production volume of Hungary during the Horthy era.

If we take the output of 1938 as 100, then the output in 1949: electricity was 185.7 percent, steel was 132.9 percent, coal was 126.4 percent, and pig iron was 122.7 percent; and the output in 1953: electricity was 324.5 percent, steel was 233.4 percent, coal was 277.5 percent, and pig iron was 213.7 percent. Due to the development of heavy industry, the average output of our basic industrial products per capita has increased.

However, in addition to these achievements in industrialization, the errors committed in industrialization have also been exposed, especially in 1953. The June 1953 resolution of our party revealed our mistakes and also pointed out the ways to correct them. The essence of socialist industrialization is to develop heavy industry, because the development of heavy industry is the foundation for expanding production and the prerequisite for developing light industry and agriculture. In our economic policy, the application of this theory is correct and necessary. However, our heavy industry developed too fast, while light industry and the food industry were not fast enough. Due to the rapid development of heavy industry, especially in the past few years, industrial production has taken more care of heavy industry. While developing heavy industry at a very high speed, we neglected the development of agriculture. This caused a large imbalance between the two most important sectors of our national economy—industry and agriculture. Unfortunately, in the implementation of the above measures, as pointed out by the March 1955 plenary session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, there were some errors. The main goal of our party is to improve the people's welfare and meet their growing material and cultural needs on the basis of expanding socialist production and improving labor productivity. All of this can only be achieved by developing heavy industry, the entire industry, and agriculture. Thanks to the vigilance of the Hungarian Working People's Party, we believe that as long as we recognize various precise relationships, our people's economy will definitely have a bright future. Regarding the preparation of the Second Five-Year Plan, Comrade Rakosi said in his report at the Third Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party: "Since our First Five-Year Plan ended in 1954, a question has reasonably arisen: Regarding the upcoming Second Five-Year Plan, what conclusions should we draw from our accumulated experience in planned economy, from achievements and mistakes? What conclusions should be drawn from the resolutions of the Central Committee—these resolutions are the beginning of the transformation—and from the experience accumulated in these resolutions in the past nearly one year? The question lies in: We must pay attention to all the above when formulating the Second Five-Year Plan and defining the basic tasks and indicators of this plan. We must pay attention to the main characteristics of the new stage of our socialist construction. We must ensure the complete or partial elimination of the disproportionate phenomena existing in our national economy. We must ensure that the errors of excessive industrialization are not repeated. We must ensure that during the Second Five-Year Plan, the development speed of the national economy should always be consistent with the growth of residents' living welfare. In order to make the Second Five-Year Plan prepared more thoroughly than the First Five-Year Plan, the Central Committee proposed a suggestion to the Congress for review: We will use 1955 as a preparation period, then the period of the Second Five-Year Plan will be from 1956 to 1960. This provides us with the possibility that when formulating the Second Five-Year Plan, we can not only apply the general experience gained in the process of realizing the First Five-Year Plan, but also apply the new experience we have gained in 1953 to 1954 due to the implementation of the transformation of our economic policy."

From Comrade Rakosi's report at the Party Congress, it can be clearly seen how thoughtful our party is in preparing and executing the work of our socialist construction! This report bravely exposes the errors in the work and tries to learn lessons from these errors, which guarantees our country's healthy development in the future.

Despite these errors, the investment in the past four years still reflects important achievements. Sixty-five new enterprises were put into production in the First Five-Year Plan. Sixty of these new enterprises started production in the first four years of the First Five-Year Plan. These enterprises are equivalent to 24.3 percent of the total industrial investment in 1950 to 1953. The proportion of output of various new enterprises to the total industrial output is growing year by year. During the Five-Year Plan, 84 important enterprises were expanded. Due to new investments, the production of certain sectors, especially basic industrial sectors, has been greatly expanded. In the past four years, in order to expand the output of coal mines, 30 shafts have been put into production. In 1953, the output of new shafts reached 16 percent of the total output of coal mines. We have also considerably expanded the output of pig iron. The output of the two new blast furnaces established in the Five-Year Plan is approximately equal to 41 percent of the pig iron output. The new power stations put into production from 1950 to 1953 supplied 35 percent of the country's electricity.

1945 also brought the liberation of the peasants. As early as the early days of liberation, the Hungarian Communist Party began to prepare for land reform, distributing 5.5 million holds of land to the working peasants. On these distributed lands, the working peasants began to restore and develop agriculture with great enthusiasm. State-owned farms have been organized, and at the same time, more and more working peasants have adopted large-scale cultivation methods: the agricultural collectivization movement has begun. At present, the socialist component has reached 40 percent in our agriculture. We have made our country suitable for rice cultivation. Before the war, our rice was imported from abroad. Compared with 1938, the output of oil crops has increased by 831 percent, the harvest of raw materials for the textile industry has increased by 613.8 percent, and the harvest of sugar beets has increased by 289.6 percent.

At present, the most important tasks of our agriculture are to increase grain production and develop animal husbandry. Due to the war, our livestock suffered great losses. Most of the livestock was slaughtered, and our breeding stock was also robbed and transported to the West. Therefore, we had to start our animal husbandry from scratch. Livestock growth is slow and very uneven, because we do not have sufficient feed. In this way, the varieties of our livestock change with the quality of feed production. The most unsatisfactory is the situation of cattle breeding. The number of dairy cows has decreased, and in 1953, the number of cows was only 51 percent of the total number of livestock. With a small number of dairy cows, the milk output cannot have proper growth. In the period after liberation, the average annual output of each dairy cow did not reach the level of the period before liberation. However, the effect of the government program can be felt. The peasants' interest in raising cattle is growing day by day; the number of pregnant female animals is quite large, and the rapid growth of livestock production can be expected. At the same time, the output of livestock products will also increase, which means that important foods such as meat, fat, and milk will be greatly enriched, and we will also be able to properly supply the light industry with the necessary amount of raw hides and furs.

The resolution of the June 1953 Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party pointed out that we did not pay sufficient attention to the development of agriculture, and the same is true for the steps of investment. Although the speed of mechanization has exceeded several times during the Three-Year Plan, the number of agricultural machines is still insufficient. Although the number of tractors handed over to agriculture during the Five-Year Plan ending in 1954 exceeded 251.6 percent of the delivery to agriculture during the Three-Year Plan. In the past four years, the investment in threshing machines has exceeded 47.5 percent of the same project in the Three-Year Plan. However, as pointed out in the December resolution of the Party and the government, this quantity is obviously inappropriate. Therefore, in 1954, we made a plan to produce 1,000 threshing machines.

Under the old regime, only the larger cities and industrial centers in Hungary received electricity supply. Few villages were supplied with electricity, and there was no electricity in rural areas. After liberation, we started large-scale rural electrification. Electrification had already started during the Three-Year Plan. The proof of our achievements is that in 1938, only 25.7 percent of our villages were electrified, while at the end of 1953, this number had reached 68 percent. In addition to rural areas, we have also electrified 251 machine tractor stations, 356 state-owned farms, and 348 production cooperatives in the past four years. Due to the increase in production, the transportation industry has also been developed. Therefore, ten million forints were allocated in the Five-Year Plan for the development of the transportation industry. From 1950 to 1953, we completed the construction and modernization of some railway lines, and completed the restoration of some first-class double-track lines. We also expanded many stations. The freight car factory increased by 11.3 percent, and the passenger car factory increased by 10.8 percent. Thanks to these allocations, road transportation has developed rapidly. The asphalt roads, concrete roads, and gravel roads built and modernized in the past four years are enough to build a new and modern highway from Budapest to Bucharest. Due to the local long-distance buses and the passage of trams and trolleybuses, passenger transportation on the road has become more developed.

Before liberation, no one cared about improving the material and cultural living standards of the working people. After liberation, this situation changed fundamentally. In our liberated country, people are the most precious. Our party and government have spared no effort to improve the backward medical system left by the Horthy regime. We have vigorously rebuilt and equipped the existing hospitals, and increased the number of beds in hospitals and maternity hospitals.

Residential construction is proceeding rapidly. In addition to building houses, Hungary also needs to build modern new school buildings. From 1950 to 1953, a total of 158 classrooms were established for ordinary schools and 91 classrooms were established for secondary schools in Budapest and larger cities. Higher education has greatly developed. We have also established many industrial apprentice schools and practice workshops.

In the first four years of the Five-Year Plan, the number of nurseries has more than tripled. The funds for developing public education are also paid in large amounts. Rural cultural centers and libraries are constantly growing. Our film art has also made great progress. Before liberation, the Hungarian people did not have a national film art based on their own culture. The new Hungarian film art is rich and colorful. This is why our films are also welcomed abroad. Hungary often participates in film festivals held all over the world. Many of our films have won first prizes. From 1949 to 1954, the rural cinema network has almost tripled, and the number of cinemas has increased from 1,432 to 3,779.

Our party and government also pay special attention to the development of sports. The most important of the sports venues we have built is the People's Stadium, which can accommodate 90,000 people. In addition, we have restored the Budapest Red Flag Stadium, which was destroyed during the war. We have built a new gymnasium and a boarding school with 260 beds in the Tata training camp. In order to carry out sports activities in rural areas, we have established sports fields and playgrounds in various places.

From this, we can see that Hungary has not wasted the ten years of freedom. No capitalist country can boast of such great achievements, although we do not hide our shortcomings either. The achievements prove that since liberation, our country has been moving forward smoothly, and we are good at using the various opportunities brought to us by liberation. These achievements are the result of the unanimous action of the Hungarian people. If our country had disharmony and disunity, these achievements would have been impossible.

These achievements are also promoted by the active diplomatic policy of our government. Our government has consistently pursued a peaceful policy based on consolidated friendship with the Soviet Union and other countries in the peace camp.

Our foreign policy aims at cooperating with all countries on the basis of equality of rights and respect for each other's interests. In 1954, the People's Republic of Hungary had diplomatic relations with 34 countries, 23 of which were capitalist countries, and also had foreign trade delegations stationed in 31 countries. Hungary has consistently strived to develop diplomatic relations, but opposes all policies that mean interference in the internal affairs of other countries. The peace-loving Hungarian people, who have lived under the occupation of foreign oppressors for four hundred years, and have twice suffered the terror and destruction of the wars caused by German imperialism within a hundred years, together with the people of European countries, oppose the plans and attempts to revive German imperialism. The experience of the two world wars tells the Hungarian people that the revival of German militarism seriously threatens the fruits of the Hungarian people's peaceful construction.

We demand to join the United Nations organization. Therefore, we welcome the Soviet Union's proposal, which aims to enable our country to take active actions together with all European countries, large and small, as an equal member, to strengthen international cooperation.

We know that the US government is trying its best to undermine the construction plans of the people's democratic countries. They disregard the rights of the powerful People's Republic of China, just as they disregard our just demands. However, the international prestige of the People's Republic of China is increasing day by day despite the US government's best efforts to obstruct it. The Chinese people, led by the Communist Party, are building their own country, and are making great achievements every day in developing the national economy and improving the people's living standards. China's natural resources, the diligence of the Chinese people, and its peaceful foreign policy guarantee that its plans can be realized regardless of the conspiracies carried out by the enemies.

We deeply know the heroism of the Chinese people and their love of freedom, and at the same time we are convinced that they will definitely be able to defend their independence, liberate Taiwan, and liberate the compatriots who are still suffering under the oppression of Chiang Kai-shek, no matter how the US government tries to divert their intention with various threats. All peace-loving people condemn the US government's aggressive policy towards Taiwan. Our people are closely concerned about this struggle, but we are deeply convinced that the just cause of the Chinese people will sooner or later defeat the imperialist aggressors.

The People's Republic of China is not isolated on the international stage. The powerful Soviet Union—the greatest country in the world—and all people's democratic countries without exception are proud to be friends of the Chinese people. The same is true for those countries that are fighting against imperialist colonial policies and defending the freedom, independence, and peace of the people.

In Asia and around the world, the liberation of colonial peoples has become an urgent issue today. No imperialist country can stop this movement or reverse the wheels of history. On the tenth anniversary of our liberation, we are pleased to announce that the technical, scientific and cultural cooperation agreements concluded between China and Hungary have consolidated and deepened the friendship between our two nations. Their mutual cooperation promotes the economic and cultural development of both countries.

The Hungarian people, who have lived in freedom for ten years, have experienced the various great possibilities that freedom has brought us. Therefore, we warmly hope that our great friend—the People's Republic of China—will continue to move forward in building a happy motherland.

On the tenth anniversary of our liberation, we wish that the people of all countries can live a free, happy, and independent life with us.

Long live the fraternal cooperation among the people of all countries! Long live the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union! Long live the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people!

    匈牙利解放十周年
    匈牙利人民共和国驻华大使  斯克拉丹
    在匈牙利人民的心里，再没有比一九四五年四月四日——匈牙利解放的光荣节日印象更深的日子了。匈牙利的历史有着许多篇页。在其中最光辉的一页上，我国人民记录着这样的一天：我国在久长的被压迫的年代以后，终于成为人民做了自由祖国的主人的永远自由的独立的国家了。
    在遭受压迫的长时期中，匈牙利人民几次三番作过努力，要挣脱自己的镣铐、获得祖国的自由和独立。不幸这些努力只得到暂时的结果。台萨、科苏特、裴多菲和其他许多人士的光荣事迹，表明了他们和匈牙利人民多么热爱自由。
    一九四五年四月四日给我们带来了永恒的自由的是光荣的苏联军队，因为他们从匈牙利全国领土上赶走了法西斯侵略者。
    我国人民一向怀着极大的同情注目于建设社会主义的苏联。在它给我们带来了自由、解除了我们手上的镣铐以后，苏联永远留在我们的心头了。
    只有那些身受压迫的痛苦并为自由而斗争过的人们才能真正了解自由对于匈牙利工人究竟有多大的意义。在解放前的二十五年间，匈牙利工人忍受过各式各样的白色恐怖和被压迫被剥削的种种痛苦。人民的权利遭到宪兵的蹂躏。命运使他们接受的是鞭子，不是面包。统治机构经常陷于危机，劳动人民不得不挨受危机所带来的困苦。
    一九三○年，工业方面有二十万以上的失业者和半失业者，农业方面有五十万到六十万的失业者。十三岁到十四岁的女孩为了难以糊口的十六个到二十个费来（匈牙利旧辅币名）工资而每天工作十二小时。八小时工作制得不到法律的保障。成千成万的人家住在贫民窟和宿夜棚里。在一九二八年到一九三四年间，农业工人的工资下降了百分之五十六。由于钱庄和富农的横暴，成万的农民受到极度的盘剥。钱庄毫不留情地连农民的枕头都拿走，不然就把他们的小块田地和小屋拍卖掉。对于手工业者或小贩也毫不留情。破产的人数增加了三倍。一九三三年有二千五百名教师失了业，而当时迫切需要的就是教师，因为许多农村都还没有学校。一九二九年订约雇用七年的青年工程师所得工资每小时只有四十费来，这个数目甚至不够维持他们自己的生活。布达佩斯就有着七万户贫民。出生率不断下降，而死亡率则不断增长。
    资产阶级千方百计地追求着利润，也就把国家变成了坟场。在一九二五年到一九二九年间，工业资本家的利润增加了百分之九十五，在旧匈牙利，百分之三十八的农业人口是完全没有土地的，而大部分也不过拥有一霍尔德到五霍尔德土地（一霍尔德约等于九亩）而已。当时费斯脱蒂什亲王所拥有的田产达九万六千一百二十二霍尔德，遍布三十三个村子。保罗·叶斯脱哈才亲王拥有二十二万二千二百四十霍尔德，遍布一百六十二个村子。天主教教会拥有几十万英亩的地产，而三百万赤贫农民则甚至没有立锥之地。
    我还可以继续列举这种罪恶统治的恶果，但这并不是我的目的。我回忆过去，只是要证明罪恶的旧社会制度是怎样的，它怎样使我们的国家走向毁灭，而它最后又怎样被苏联的战无不胜的军队所粉碎。
    一个崭新的国家正在建设起来，接替着这个坏制度。解放了的人民正在建设一个幸福的社会主义国家。在这国家里，人已成为最宝贵的财产，劳动已成为光荣而豪迈的事情，工作和休息的权利得到了法律的保障。这里没有剥削，没有穷苦；只有一个伟大的目标，人人都为了这目标而辛苦地工作着，不断地建设着自由的国家和劳动者的幸福生活。
    我们来考察一下：今天匈牙利人民是怎样生活，怎样工作的，他们怎样运用了解放以来的自由所提供的各种机会。
    在政治生活方面，我们的成就的起点是我国人民把国家的领导权交给了匈牙利共产党。这件事情本身就是使匈牙利的一切都为进步、为劳动人民的利益服务的保证。匈牙利共产党努力使匈牙利永远割断了和帝国主义的联系，从而挫败了匈牙利资产阶级要发动内战的阴谋活动。为了建立无产阶级专政曾进行过一场斗争。这是给予美英帝国主义的重大打击，正如我们党的斗争给予旧统治阶级决定性的打击一样。匈牙利共产党的纲领的实现是得到进步党派的支持的，因为它们知道这个纲领符合于劳动人民和整个国家的利益。组成民族独立阵线的各党派，确认了匈牙利共产党的领导作用——这是由于早在解放前的地下工作年代中，它那不妥协的一贯的反法西斯斗争所表现出来的。在战时所拟订的纲领中，匈牙利共产党就宣布了一切爱国力量联合起来的主张，并且把它实现了。在这些力量的帮助下，我们大家知道，这个纲领终于完全贯彻了。这场斗争并不是轻易的。例如要肃清国家机构中的法西斯分子，要把战争罪犯交给人民法庭审判，要准备土地改革计划和实施的步骤，要把垄断企业和大银行置于国家监督之下，把矿山收归国有等等。可是我们党出色地领导了这场斗争。因而它能够满足我国劳动人民的愿望，并提高党的威信和声望。由此可见，人民民主的意义就是斗争。谁在这个斗争中会赢得胜利，当时原不是很明显的。
    匈牙利的国际威望也是由于下列的一些事实才提高的：苏联首先承认了匈牙利政府，早在一九四五年一月二十日，就和我国在莫斯科缔结了停战协定。苏联用各种方法来支持我们，它交给布达佩斯一些卡车、大量的食物和窗玻璃。它陆续归还了苏军征用的工厂。还签订了第一个苏匈换货协定，这个协定大大地帮助了我国的重建工作。
    匈牙利在刚解放的时候原是百孔千疮的。战争毁坏了百分之四十五的国民财富，百分之三十到三十五的工业产品。只剩下百分之十的工厂能够进行工作。百分之二十以上的农具和一半以上的家畜都丧失了。百分之三十八的工矿企业、百分之十八的房屋、百分之七十的机车、百分之八十的车皮都给破坏了。差不多全部桥梁都破坏了。有十六万八千吨的工作母机、纺织品和皮革制品、药品、邮政和铁路设备全给德国人抢走了。但最令人痛心的是：法西斯战争使我国丧失了四十万人的生命。这就是法西斯分子留下来的凄惨的遗产。
    但是，我国人民并没有气馁。他们勇敢地站在废墟上宣布我们党的口号：匈牙利一定会重建起来。这是逐步实现了。我们迅速地恢复了我国的铁路和桥梁。除了重建我们的工厂以外，我们还建造了数千幢住宅，分配了土地，实行了币制改革，并开始了计划经济。一九四六年八月一日实施的稳定货币的办法，消除了我国经济生活的混乱。随着新币的发行，工业生产开始迅速地增加起来，同时这又有效地保持了币值的稳定。在币值稳定的可靠基础上，我们从一九四七年八月起开始实行三年计划，这个计划的目的是重建我们的国家，重建并发展匈牙利的制造工业。我国制造工业在两年又五个月中大大地超额完成了三年计划的原定目标。制造工业的生产量早在一九四九年就超过了一九三八年的水平。三年计划的顺利实现，使匈牙利人民共和国在政治上和经济上日益加强，从而能够开始实现国家工业化了。
    一九五○年一月一日，根据我们党的提议，我国开始了要使匈牙利成为具有进步的农业的工业国的五年计划。按照计划，我国的工业迅速地发展起来。在一九五三年，我国制造工业的产量几等于一九三八年的三倍半，这种巨大的增长，在危机深重的资本主义国家中是办不到的。资本主义国家的工业生产，从经常的情况来看，即使有些微的增长也并不是由于不断发展的结果，而我们匈牙利的工业生产却是直线上升的。
    从过去几年工业生产的平均增加率方面也可以看出，社会主义工业化是比资本主义工业化优越的。在一九四九年到一九五三年间，制造工业每年平均增加率在匈牙利是百分之二十五，在奥地利是百分之七点二七，在意大利是百分之九点四五，在比利时是百分之二点九六，而在荷兰是百分之六点五五。在五年计划期间，因许多新建企业而加强的制造工业急速地发展起来，结果表明，匈牙利已经成为一个工业国了。最重要的基本物资生产量大大地超过了霍尔梯时代的匈牙利的最大生产量。
    如果我们以一九三八年的产量为一百，那末，一九四九年的产量：电力是百分之一百八十五点七，钢是百分之一百三十二点九，煤是百分之一百二十六点四，生铁是百分之一百二十二点七；而在一九五三年的产量：电力是百分之三百二十四点五，钢是百分之二百三十三点四，煤是百分之二百七十七点五，生铁是百分之二百十三点七。由于重工业的发展，我国基本工业品按人口计算的平均产量是增长了。
    然而除了工业化所获得的这些成就以外，在工业化方面所犯的错误也暴露出来了，特别是在一九五三年。我们党的一九五三年六月决议揭露了我们的错误，同时也指出了纠正的办法。社会主义工业化的实质是发展重工业，因为重工业的发展是扩大生产的基础，是发展轻工业和农业的先决条件。在我们经济政策中，这个理论的应用是正确和必需的，然而，我国的重工业发展得太快，而轻工业和食品工业不够快。由于重工业的急速发展，尤其是在过去几年，工业生产较多地照顾到重工业。在以极高的速度发展重工业的同时，我们忽略了农业的发展，这样，就引起了我国国民经济最主要的两大部门——工业和农业间的很大不平衡。不幸的是在上述的措施的执行中，正如匈牙利劳动人民党一九五五年三月中央委员会全体会议所指出的，有了一些错误。我们党的主要目的，就是在扩大社会主义生产和提高劳动生产率的基础上增进人民的福利和满足他们日益增长的物质和文化的需要。这一切，只有发展了重工业、整个工业和农业才能达到。由于匈牙利劳动人民党的警惕，我们相信：只要认识到各种确当的关系，我国的人民经济是一定会有美好发展的前途的。关于第二个五年计划的准备情况，拉科西同志在匈牙利劳动人民党第三次代表大会上所作的报告中说：“由于我们的第一个五年计划是在一九五四年结束，因而很合理地产生了一个问题：关于即将到来的第二个五年计划，我们应该从我们已往积累的计划经济的经验中，从成绩和错误中得出些什么结论呢？从中央委员会的决议中——这些决议是转变的开始——以及过去将近一年中在这些决议的基础上积累起来的经验中又应得出什么结论呢？问题就在于：在制定第二个五年计划以及规定这一计划的基本任务和指标时我们必须注意上述一切。必须注意我国社会主义建设新阶段的主要特征。必须保证全部地或是部分地消灭存在于我国国民经济中的不合比例的现象。必须保证使过度地工业化的错误不再重复。必须保证在第二个五年计划期间，国民经济发展的速度应与居民生活福利的增长始终一贯地相适应。为了使第二个五年计划能比第一个五年计划准备得更加彻底，中央委员会提出一个建议请代表大会审查：我们利用一九五五年作为准备时期，那末，第二个五年计划的时期将是从一九五六年到一九六○年。这就给我们提供了可能，即在制定第二个五年计划时我们不仅能应用在实现第一个五年计划的过程中所获得的一般经验，而且能应用我们在一九五三到一九五四年间因我国经济政策实行了转变而获得的新的经验。”
    从拉科西同志在党代表大会上所作的报告中，可以清楚地看到：我们党在准备和执行我国社会主义建设的工作中间是多么的深思熟虑啊！这个报告勇敢地揭发了工作中的错误，从这些错误中竭力吸取教训，这样做就保证了我国今后健全的发展。
    尽管有着这些错误，过去四年中的投资还是反映了重要的成就。在第一个五年计划中投入生产的新企业有六十五个。其中六十个新企业在第一个五年计划的头四年里就开始生产了。这些企业相当于一九五○年到一九五三年度工业投资总值的百分之二十四点三。各项新企业的产量对全部工业产量的比重逐年增长着，在五年计划期间，有八十四个重要企业扩建了。由于新的投资，某些生产部门特别是基本工业部门的生产大大地扩大了。在过去四年中，为了扩大煤矿的产量，有三十个竖井投入了生产。在一九五三年新的竖井产量达到了煤矿总产量的百分之十六。我们还相当地扩大了生铁的产量。在五年计划中所建立的两个新高炉的产量约等于生铁产量的百分之四十一。一九五○年到一九五三年中投入生产的新建电站，供给了全国电力的百分之三十五。
    一九四五年也带来了农民的解放。早在解放的初期，匈牙利共产党就着手准备土地改革，将五百五十万霍尔德的土地分给了劳动农民。在这些分配的土地上，劳动农民以极大的热情开始恢复和发展农业。国营农场组织起来了，同时劳动农民越来越多地采取大规模耕作方式：农业合作化运动开始了。目前，社会主义成分在我国农业中已达到百分之四十。我们已使本国适于种植稻谷了。在战前，我国的大米是从国外进口的。和一九三八年相比，油料作物的产量增加了百分之八百三十一，纺织工业原料的收获量增加了百分之六百十三点八，甜菜增加了百分之二百八十九点六。
    目前，我国农业最主要的任务是提高谷物产量和发展畜牧业。由于战争，我国的牲畜受到了很大的损失。大部分牲畜杀掉了，我们的种畜也被劫运到西方。因此，我们不得不从头开始我们的畜牧业。牲畜的生长很慢，很不平衡，因为我们没有充足的饲料。这样，我们牲畜的品种就随着饲料生产的好坏而改变着。最不能令人满意的是牧牛业的情况，乳牛的头数降低了，而在一九五三年牛的头数只是全部牲畜头数的百分之五十一。乳牛数量小，牛奶的产量也就不能有适当的增长。在解放后的时期中，每头乳牛的每年平均产量没有达到解放以前时期的水平。但是政府纲领的效果却可以感觉到。农民对养牛的兴趣正在日益增长；怀孕的母畜数量相当多，牲畜产量的迅速增长是可以指望的。同时，畜产品产量也会增加，这就是说：重要食品如肉类、脂肪、牛奶等会大大地丰裕起来，并且我们将也有可能以必需数量的生皮和皮毛来适当地供应轻工业。
    匈牙利劳动人民党一九五三年六月中央全会的决议指出，我们对农业的发展没有给予充分的注意，而对投资的步骤也是这样。虽然机械化的速度超过了三年计划期间数倍，但是农业机器的数量仍不够。尽管在到一九五四年年底为止的五年计划期间，交给农业的拖拉机数量超过了三年计划期间对农业的交货额百分之二百五十一点六。在过去四年中，打谷机投资数量超过了三年计划的同一项目百分之四十七点五。可是正如党和政府的十二月决议所指出的，这种数量显然是不适当的。因此，在一九五四年我们作出了生产一千台打谷机的计划。
    在旧政权下，匈牙利只有较大的城市和工业中心得到电力供应。对乡村很少供电，对农村更谈不到了。解放后，我们开始了大规模的农村电气化。在三年计划期间就已开始电气化了。我们所获成就的证明就是：在一九三八年我们只有百分之二十五点七的农村实行了电气化，而在一九五三年底，这个数字已经达到了百分之六十八。除农村外，过去四年里我们还在二百五十一个机器拖拉机站、三百五十六个国营农场和三百四十八个生产合作社里实行了电气化。由于生产的提高，运输事业也得到发展，因此，五年计划里为发展运输事业拨款一千万福林。一九五○到一九五三年期间，我们完成了一些铁路线的修筑和现代化工作，完成了一些头等的双轨路线的修复工作。我们也扩建了许多车站。货车厂增加了百分之十一点三，客车厂增加了百分之十点八。由于这些拨款，公路运输迅速发展了。过去四年中所修筑和现代化了的柏油路、混凝土和碎石路，足以修成从布达佩斯到布加勒斯特间的一条最新的现代化公路。由于地方的长距离公共汽车以及电车和无轨电车的通行，公路上的旅客运输更加发展了。
    解放前，没有人关心提高劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平，解放后，这种情形起了根本的转变。在我们获得解放的国家里，人是最宝贵的。我们的党和政府不遗余力地改进了霍尔梯政权遗留下来的落后的医疗系统，我们大力重建和装备了现有的医院，在医院和产科医院中增加了病床数目。
    住宅建筑正在迅速进行。除了建筑住宅外，匈牙利还需建筑现代化的新校舍。从一九五○年到一九五三年期间，在布达佩斯和较大的城市中，总共为普通学校建立了一百五十八间教室，为中等学校建立了九十一间教室。高等教育有很大的发展。我们还建立了许多工业艺徒学校和实习车间。
    在五年计划的头四年里，托儿所的数目增加了三倍多。发展公共教育的经费也是大量支付的。农村文化中心和图书馆不断增长。我们的电影艺术也获得了巨大的发展。解放前，匈牙利人民没有以本国文化为基础的民族影片艺术，新的匈牙利电影艺术是丰富多采的。这就是我国影片也受到国外欢迎的原因。匈牙利经常参加世界各地所举办的电影节。我国放映的许多影片获得一等奖。从一九四九年到一九五四年期间，农村电影院网几乎扩大了三倍，电影院的数目已从一千四百三十二所增加到三千七百七十九所。
    我们的党和政府又特别关怀体育运动事业的发展。我们建的体育场所中最重要的一所是可容九万人的人民体育场。此外，我们修复了战争期间被破坏了的布达佩斯红旗体育场。我们在塔达训练营建筑了新体育馆和一个有着二百六十张床位的寄宿学校。为了在农村中开展体育活动，我们在各地建立了运动场和游戏场。
    由此我们可以看出，匈牙利没有虚度自由的十年。没有一个资本主义国家能够自夸这样巨大的成就，虽然我们也并不隐瞒自己的缺点。所获得的成就证明，自从解放以来，我国一直顺利地前进，我们善于利用解放带给我们的种种机会。这些成就是匈牙利人民的一致行动所造成的。如果我国有着不协调和不团结的情况，这些成就是不可能的。
    这些成就也是我国政府的积极外交政策所促成的。我国政府一贯奉行着以对苏联及其他的和平阵营国家的巩固友谊为基础的和平政策。
    我国的外交政策，以在权利平等和尊重彼此利益的基础上同各国合作为目的。一九五四年，匈牙利人民共和国和三十四个国家发生了外交上的关系，其中有二十三个是资本主义国家，此外并在三十一个国家里驻有对外贸易代表团。匈牙利一贯努力于发展外交关系，但是反对那些意味着干涉他国内政的各种政策。曾在外国压迫者的占领下生活了四百年，并在百年内两次受到德国帝国主义所引起的战争的恐怖和破坏的爱好和平的匈牙利人民，同欧洲各国人民一起，反对复活德国帝国主义的计划和企图。两次世界大战的经验告诉了匈牙利人民，德国军国主义的复活严重地威胁到匈牙利人民和平建设事业的成果。
    我们要求参加联合国组织。因此我们欢迎苏联所提出的、目的在于使我国也能和所有欧洲的大小国家一起，作为一个平等的成员，采取积极行动来加强国际合作的建议。
    我们知道美国政府正在竭力破坏人民民主国家的建设计划。他们漠视强大的中华人民共和国的权利，正如他们不顾我们的正义要求一样。但是，中华人民共和国的国际威望在美国政府的竭力阻挠下还是与日俱增。共产党所领导的中国人民正在建设自己祖国，在发展国民经济和提高人民生活水平方面，每天获得伟大的成就。中国的自然资源，中国人民的勤奋和它的和平外交政策，保证它的计划在不管敌人进行着怎样的阴谋的情况下都能够实现。
    我们深知中国人民的英雄主义和对自由的热爱，同时我们确信他们一定能够保卫自己的独立，解放台湾，解放目前还在蒋贼压迫下受难的同胞，不管美国政府怎样用各种威胁竭力要转移他们的这一种意愿。所有爱好和平的人民都谴责美国政府对台湾的侵略政策。我国人民密切关心着这个斗争，可是我们深信，中国人民的正义事业迟早一定会战胜帝国主义侵略者的。
    中华人民共和国在国际舞台上并不孤立。强大的苏联——这一个世界上最伟大的国家和各人民民主国家毫无例外地都以做中国人民的朋友而感到骄傲。就那些为反对帝国主义殖民政策，保卫人民的自由、独立与和平而进行斗争的国家来说也是这样。
    在亚洲以及全世界，殖民地人民的解放已成为今天的迫切问题。没有一个帝国主义国家能够阻止这个运动或是扭转历史的车轮。在我国解放十周年的时候，我们愉快地宣告，中匈两国所缔结的技术、科学和文化合作协定巩固和加深了我们两个民族间的友谊。他们的相互合作，促进了两国经济和文化的发展。
    在自由中生活了十年的匈牙利人民，体会到自由带给我们的各种巨大的可能性。因此，我们热烈地希望我们的伟大朋友——中华人民共和国在建设幸福的祖国当中不断前进。
    在我国解放十周年的时候，我们愿各国人民和我们一起都能过自由、幸福和独立的生活。
    各国人民间的兄弟合作万岁！以苏联为首的和平阵营万岁！匈中两国人民永久的友谊万岁！
