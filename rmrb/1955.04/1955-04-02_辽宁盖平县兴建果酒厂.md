    Liaoning Gaiping County is building a fruit winery. The construction and equipment installation are underway and will be completed by the end of August and put into production. Once completed, this fruit winery will be able to produce 500 tons of fruit wine and 100 tons of brandy annually.
    Gaiping County is a major apple-producing area. According to 1954 statistics, the county has more than 2.48 million fruit trees, with a total apple output of 57,600 tons. The main raw materials for fruit wine are thinned fruit and fallen fruit (unripe fruit removed due to excessive fruit setting is called thinned fruit, and fruit that falls due to wind or hail disasters is called fallen fruit). The county has more than 10,000 *jin* of thinned and fallen fruit suitable for winemaking each year. In the past, farmers fed the thinned and fallen fruit to pigs, used it for bedding, or threw it away because they could not sell it, resulting in significant losses. After the new fruit winery goes into production, it will be able to collect more than 4,300 tons of thinned and fallen fruit annually at 40 yuan per ton, which can increase farmers' income significantly. It can also create 2.87 million yuan of wealth for the country each year. (Mei Wen)

    辽宁盖平县兴建果酒厂
    辽宁盖平县果酒厂现在正在兴工修建和进行设备的安装工作，八月末将全部完工投入生产。这个果酒厂建成后，每年可生产果酒五百吨，白兰地酒一百吨。
    盖平县是苹果盛产区，根据一九五四年的统计，全县共有果树二百四十八万多株，苹果总产量为五万七千六百吨。果酒的主要原料是稀果、落果
  （未成熟因结果太多而摘掉的叫稀果，遇有风、雹灾而坠落的叫落果），该县每年适于酿酒的稀果、落果即有万多斤，历年来农民因不能销售，把稀果、落果都喂猪、垫圈或扔掉，损失很大。新建果酒厂投入生产后，每年能收稀果、落果四千三百多吨，每吨四十元，可增加农民大量收入。每年并能给国家创造二百八十七万元的财富。（枚闻）
