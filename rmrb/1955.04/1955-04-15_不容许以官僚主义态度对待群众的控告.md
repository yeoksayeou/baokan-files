    Going deep into the grassroots, closely linking with the masses, and relying on the masses are the excellent work styles of our Party. In its long-term work, our Party has accumulated a wealth of experience in going deep among the masses, some of which have been formed into systems, enabling our Party's leading organs and leading cadres to frequently go deep among the masses, establish close ties with the masses, accept the supervision of the masses, provide concrete leadership to grassroots cadres, and help them to discover and solve problems in a timely manner.
    To closely link with the masses and accept their supervision, we must frequently mobilize the masses to criticize and expose various shortcomings and errors from the bottom up. The Party has repeatedly educated us that we must embrace a warm welcome and resolute protection towards criticism, especially criticism from below, and ensure that all criticisms, suggestions, reports, and accusations from the masses are handled in a timely and fair manner. Therefore, disciplinary inspection departments are set up in the Party's organizations at all levels to specifically handle incidents of Party members violating Party discipline. The state also has People's Procuratorates and People's Supervision Organs at all levels (larger factories and mining enterprises have Supervision Offices). The Party and government organizations at all levels also have People's Reception Offices, or designated full-time cadres, under the personal leadership of the heads of the organizations, to be responsible for handling people's letters and receiving people's visits. Many local Party and government leaders also personally read some of the people's letters, and in addition to receiving the masses at ordinary times, they also specifically stipulate a system of regularly receiving visiting masses. All these have facilitated the development of criticism from the bottom up and facilitated the appeals and accusations of the masses, playing a great role in closely linking the Party and the government with the masses.
    However, in recent years, many comrades in Party committees and state organs at all levels have developed a sense of pride and complacency due to certain achievements on the front lines of national construction. They have neglected the principles repeatedly taught by the Party that we must closely link with the masses and carry out criticism and self-criticism. They confine themselves to the leading organs, busy with meetings and issuing documents, without going deep into reality and among the masses for a long time. They do not know that the masses are improving their work day by day; they do not know that many new problems and difficulties have emerged on the road to progress, and that many new shortcomings and errors have arisen. In this way, they cannot proactively discover and solve problems; even when the masses have come to their door, making criticisms and suggestions about the work, and reporting Party members and cadres under their leadership, they do not listen with an open mind and do not make serious handling. The organs under their leadership responsible for handling people's accusations often transfer the masses' accusations from this department to that department; an appeal and accusation can be dragged on for a year or two without being resolved, or although it is resolved, it is resolved poorly. Han Changxin, a worker at the small steel rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel, encountered such leaders and cadres with varying degrees of bureaucratic problems in the process of accusing Kang Zhaowen, the secretary of the Party branch, of stealing his rationalization proposal and retaliating against him.
    The leaders of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and its relevant departments were unaware that a cadre like Kang Zhaowen had done things that violated Party discipline, and the deputy minister of the Municipal Party Committee's Organization Department even praised and promoted him as a good cadre. Just as the "New Three-Anti" movement against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline was being actively carried out in various places, when Han Changxin was severely attacked by anti-Party elements and forced to a dead end, having to file a complaint with the Anshan Municipal Party Committee, the person in charge of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee did not pay attention to it. The person in charge of the Municipal Party Committee's Discipline Inspection Committee was completely unaware of such accusations; he did not know that the cadres below were going to investigate, and he did not read the report after the investigation. Even more strangely, the Municipal Party Committee's Discipline Inspection Committee actually transferred this investigation material to the Party organization led by the accused, which fueled the arrogance of the accused in carrying out retaliation. Although the person in charge of the Municipal Party Committee approved the complaint to the Ministry of Coal Industry for inspection and handling, he did not check the results of the handling, nor did he receive the workers who repeatedly requested to see him. Although the Ministry of Coal Industry of the Municipal Party Committee sent people to investigate, the person in charge of this ministry did not even look at the investigation report, but sent it to their superiors as "reference" material, and their superiors did not "refer" to it for a long time. What is particularly intolerable is that a deputy minister and a section chief of the Municipal Party Committee's Ministry of Coal Industry even showed annoyance towards Han Changxin, who had been severely attacked for persisting in the struggle, saying that he was like "sticky cake." This series of facts, in addition to indicating that there is an intolerable chaotic phenomenon in the work of handling mass accusations in the Anshan Municipal Party Committee and its relevant departments, more importantly, shows that these comrades in fact lack the due enthusiasm for the people. Their task was originally to promote the interests of the people and eliminate abuses, but they closed their ears and closed their eyes, unwilling to listen to the voices of the masses, unwilling to face up to the ugly phenomena that occurred in the departments under their leadership.
    We have also found that in some places, cases of the masses accusing responsible cadres often go through many twists and turns without being resolved; some complaints are made to the province, and some even go all the way to the central government before the truth is finally clarified and correct handling is made. Not long ago, Hebei Daily exposed that some Party member cadres in Luancheng County illegally deprived elementary school teacher Guo Zhi of his civil rights in violation of laws and regulations, which is an example. Guo Zhi spent nearly a year, running to the Luancheng County Federation of Trade Unions, the County Government Bureau of Culture and Education, the Court, the County Government, the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Commissioner's Office Election Office, the Prefectural Commissioner's Office Inquiry Office, the Shijiazhuang Branch of the Hebei Provincial People's Court, and other organs thirty-seven times, without being resolved. Finally, the relevant organs such as the Hebei Provincial People's Procuratorate and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee Supervision Department sent people to investigate and handle the case. The Han Changxin incident in Anshan is similar. Han Changxin ran to eight organs and departments in Anshan, spent twenty months, and looked for directors, section chiefs, ministers, secretaries, and so on no less than a hundred times. The emergence of this phenomenon is of course due to the lack of a strong sense of responsibility of the cadres, the unsound system of handling letters from the people and receiving visitors, and the prolonged time for solving problems. But more importantly, it is because many leading organs and leading cadres have serious pride and like to hear praise but do not like to hear criticism. They do not believe in the masses, but blindly believe in cadres, especially blindly believe in cadres they consider good. Therefore, when someone accuses such cadres, they always do not believe it, and although they conduct investigations, their investigations are preconceived, biased towards the words of a few cadres, and even biased towards the words of the accused, not believing the words of the masses and the accusers, making conclusions that do not conform to the facts, and the accusers are of course dissatisfied. Regardless of whether these leaders are intentional or unintentional, people cannot help but suspect that they are condoning and even protecting cadres who have made mistakes. Such an influence is very bad.
    Therefore, the Party and government organs in various places should earnestly take responsibility and do everything possible to ensure that the complaints filed by the masses can be handled in a timely and fair manner, especially the local Party secretaries, the heads of governments at all levels, the supervisory organs, and the departments that handle letters from the people should become the most trusted organs and personnel for handling mass complaints, and have a high prestige among the masses. In order to achieve this, in addition to further improving the system of handling letters from the people and receiving visitors, it must also be stipulated that all major and difficult cases, especially those that have not been resolved after many twists and turns, should be presided over and handled by the heads of the organs, and the bureaucratic style of not asking or checking must be resolutely overcome. If the scope of the case is wide, it should be led by the Party committee or the local People's Committee, with the participation of relevant organs and groups, to solve it together, and the bad practice of copying and forwarding the people's appeals and complaints and shirking responsibility must be resolutely overcome.
    The Party and government organizations at all levels generally attach importance to and handle the appeals and complaints of the masses fairly. Since liberation, the broad masses have unanimously believed that "in the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party, there is no injustice that cannot be redressed, and there is no reason that cannot be explained!" But we should not be satisfied, and we must understand that the bureaucratic poison left by the reactionary rule of all generations can never be completely eliminated in a short period of time. Today, some of our Party members and cadres do not have a warm welcome attitude towards the complaints of the masses, are indifferent to the suffering of the masses, and often condone and protect those who make mistakes, which should arouse our great vigilance. Party committees, government organs, business departments and mass organizations at all levels must be determined to take all effective measures to resolutely eradicate this bureaucratic work style of being divorced from the masses.

    不容许以官僚主义态度对待群众的控告
    深入下层、密切联系群众和依靠群众是我们党的优良的工作作风。我们党在长期的工作中，已经积累起许多深入群众的工作经验，有的已经形成了制度，使我们党的领导机关和领导干部能够经常深入群众，同群众建立了密切的联系，接受群众的监督，给予基层干部以具体的领导，帮助他们及时发现和解决问题。
    要做到密切联系群众，接受群众的监督，我们就必须经常发动群众自下而上地批评和揭发各种缺点和错误。党一再教育我们必须对批评、特别是对来自下面的批评抱热烈欢迎和坚决保护的态度，务必使来自群众的一切批评、建议、检举和控告都能得到及时的公正的处理。因此，我们党的各级组织都设有纪律检查部门，专门处理党员违反党的纪律的事件。国家还设有各级人民检察院和人民监察机关（较大的厂矿企业设有监察室）。我们党和政府的各级组织还设有人民接待室，或指定有专职干部，在机关负责人的亲自领导之下，负责处理人民来信和接见人民来访。许多地方的党政负责人还亲自批阅一部分人民来信，而且除了平时接见群众以外，还特别规定定期接见来访的群众的制度。所有这些都便利了自下而上的批评的开展，便利了群众的申诉和控告，在密切党和政府同群众的联系上起了很大作用。
    但是，在各级党委和国家机关中，近年来有不少同志由于在国家建设战线上取得了某些成绩，就增长了骄傲自满的情绪。他们忽视了党一再教导我们的必须密切联系群众、必须开展批评和自我批评的原则。他们关在领导机关里，忙于开会和发文件，长期不深入实际和不深入群众。群众在日新月异地改进工作，他们不知道；在前进的道路上出现很多新问题、新困难，产生不少新的缺点和错误，他们也不知道。这样，他们就不能主动地发现和解决问题；甚至群众已经跑上了门，向他们提出对于工作的批评、建议，告发了他们领导下的党员、干部，他们还不虚心倾听，不作认真的处理。在他们领导下的负责处理人民控诉的机关，又常常把群众的控诉从这个部门转到那个部门；一件申诉和控告可以拖上一年、两年不解决，或者虽然解决了，但是解决得很不好。鞍钢小型轧钢厂工人韩长信在控告党总支书记康兆文窃取他的合理化建议并对他实行打击报复的过程中，碰到的正是这样一些染有程度不等的官僚主义毛病的领导者和干部。
    中共鞍山市委和它所属的有关部门的负责人，对于康兆文这样的干部做了违反党纪的事情，竟然不知道，市委组织部副部长甚至把他当成好干部来表扬和提拔。正当反对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的“新三反”运动在各地积极开展的时候，当韩长信受到反党分子的沉重打击，被逼得走头无路，不得不向鞍山市委提出控告的时候，鞍山市委的负责人也并没有加以重视。市委纪律检查委员会的负责人，根本还不知道有这样的控告；下面的干部去调查，他也不知道；调查以后写了报告，他也没有看。更奇怪的是市委纪律检查委员会竟然把这个调查材料转给了被控告人所领导的党组织，这就助长了被控告者进行打击报复的气焰。市委的负责人虽然把这个控告批给工矿部去检查处理，但是对于处理的结果如何却没有检查，也没有接见多次要求见他的工人。市委工矿部虽然派人作过调查，但是这个部的负责人连调查报告也没有看一下，只是把它当作“参考”材料送给了他们的上级，而他们的上级又很久没有“参考”。特别令人不能容忍的是，市委工矿部的一位副部长和一个处长，竟至对于因坚持斗争而受到沉重打击的韩长信表现了厌烦情绪，说他像“黏糕”一样。这一系列的事实，除了表示鞍山市委和它所属的有关部门在处理群众控告的工作中存在着不能容忍的紊乱现象以外，更重要的是说明了这些同志在事实上缺乏对于人民群众应有的热情。他们的任务本来是为人民群众兴利除弊，但是他们却把自己的耳朵塞起来，把自己的眼睛闭起来，不愿意倾听群众的呼声，不愿意正视他们领导下的部门中发生的丑恶现象。
    我们还发现有些地方群众控告负责干部的案件，往往经过许多周折而得不到解决；有的控告到省，有的甚至一直告到中央，才最后弄清真象，作了正确的处理。不久以前，河北日报揭发栾城县的一些党员干部违法乱纪，非法地剥夺了小学教员郭志的公民权，就是一个例子。郭志费了将近一年的时间，跑过栾城县总工会、县政府文教科、法院、县政府、石家庄专署普选办公室、专署问事处、河北省人民法院石家庄专区分院等机关三十七次，一直没有得到解决，最后才由河北省人民检察院、河北省人民委员会监察厅等有关机关派人调查处理。鞍山的韩长信事件也有类似的情况。韩长信在鞍山就跑了八个机关部门，花了二十个月的时间，先后找主任、处长、部长、书记等不下一百多次。这种现象的产生，有的固然是由于干部的责任心不强，处理来信和接见来访的制度不健全，拖长了解决问题的时间。但是更重要的还是因为不少领导机关和领导干部有严重的骄傲情绪，只喜欢听到表扬，不喜欢听到批评。他们不大相信群众，却盲目相信干部，特别是盲目相信他们认为好的干部。因此，当有人控告了这样的干部的时候，他们总是不相信，虽然也进行调查，但是他们的调查是先入为主，偏听少数干部的话，甚至偏听被控告人的话，不相信群众和控告人的话，作出了不符事实的结论，控告人当然不服。不管这些领导人是有意或无意，人们不能不怀疑他们是在姑息以至包庇犯错误的干部。这样的影响是非常恶劣的。
    因此，各地的党政机关应该切实负起责任，尽一切可能使群众提出的控告都能得到及时的公正的处理，特别是地方的党委书记、各级政府负责人、监察机关和处理人民来信的部门，都应该成为处理群众控告的最可信赖的机关和人员，在群众中有很高的威信。为了作到这一点，除了应该进一步健全处理人民来信和接见来访的制度以外，还必须规定：凡是重大疑难的案件，特别是经过许多曲折而没有得到解决的案件，应该由机关负责人亲自主持处理，要坚决克服不过问不检查的官僚主义作风。如果案件牵涉的范围很广，应该以党委或地方人民委员会为主，由有关的机关和团体参加，共同解决，坚决克服把人民的申诉和控告照抄照转、互相推诿的不良作风。
    我们党和政府的各级组织，对于群众的申诉和控告一般是重视的，处理是公正的。解放几年来，广大群众一致认为“在共产党领导下的新中国，没有申不了的冤，没有讲不清的道理！”但是我们不应该满足，要懂得历代反动统治留下的官僚主义遗毒，绝不可能在短时期内全部肃清。今天我们的一些党员、干部对于群众的控告不抱热烈欢迎的态度，对于群众的疾苦漠不关心，对于犯错误的人员往往姑息和包庇，这就值得引起我们极大的警惕。各级党委、政府机关、企业部门和群众团体必须下定决心，采取一切有效措施，坚决铲除这种脱离群众的官僚主义作风。
