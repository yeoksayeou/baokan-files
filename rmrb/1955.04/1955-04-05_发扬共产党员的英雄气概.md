Promote the Heroic Spirit of Communist Party Members
Yi Huai

The heroes who built the Kangzang Highway once uttered this bold statement: "Let the high mountains bow their heads, and let the rivers make way." It was this heroic spirit of not fearing difficulties and despising difficulties that encouraged them to overcome natural barriers and establish feats that our predecessors dared not imagine for the people. Stalin said: "The existence of difficulties is for people to struggle with them and overcome them." This is the attitude of us communists, of our generation, towards difficulties. Thousands upon thousands of communist party members scattered in various work positions are constantly promoting the cause of the Party with this spirit of not fearing difficulties, which the Party constantly teaches. The drought resistance struggle led by the Longshou Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Maoming County fully embodies the heroic spirit of communist party members who are not afraid of difficulties. The drought in Longshou Township was so severe, the objective conditions were so poor, and the mood of the masses was so depressed, but the young Longshou Township Branch was not deterred by such serious difficulties. They said: "When the masses are in distress, we must lead the masses to fight against the disaster," "No matter what happens, we will guarantee to find a water source." Finally, the drought was overcome by them. There, the old saying passed down for generations by the ancestors that "no spring water can be dug here" lost its effect in the face of these communist party members!

Where did such a young branch as the Longshou Township Branch get its tenacious fighting power? The source of strength lies in their high concern for the suffering of the masses. This branch breathes together with the masses: seeing the crops that have been frozen to death, the branch secretary Ke Zhenyu thinks with heartache: "The masses are waiting for us to come up with a solution!" So he immediately runs around day and night to encourage the masses, mobilize the masses, and discuss solutions with the masses. When the agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid groups dug wells and started to rush planting, middle peasant Ke Xiuxuan, who had withdrawn from the mutual aid group, was secretly shedding tears. The branch immediately felt that this was the depression of more than 500 individual farmers. They quickly sent cadres to help them organize. Unfortunately, not all party organizations and communist party members can be like the Longshou Township branch and its members in not bowing to difficulties. Some party organizations, when they see difficulties, either panic and retreat, or abandon the masses and take care of their own petty plans. The main reason why these party organizations and communist party members lose their combat effectiveness when they encounter difficulties is that they are indifferent to the suffering of the masses, and they lack the noble quality of enduring all hardships for the sake of relieving the suffering of the masses. Huang Xiuzhen, the leader of the work team sent by the Second District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Yangjiang County to Shagang Township, is the most prominent example. This spring, the disaster situation in Shagang Township was very serious. Huang Xiuzhen lived in this township for three or four months, but never went to the fields. When the spring famine was at its worst and some households had already run out of food, the Yangjiang County Committee inspection team called to inquire about the situation in the township. Look at the answer from this work team leader! The inspection team asked: "How many early-maturing crops have been planted in the township?" He replied: "I don't know." "How many households are out of food?" The answer was: "I haven't investigated it yet!" Asked: "How are the masses solving their difficulties now?" Answer: "Collecting firewood and catching fish!" Asked: "How much can it solve?" Answer: "The masses are doing it themselves, how do I know how much it solves?" Asked: "How do you plan to solve it?" Answer: "I haven't thought about it yet!" Asked: "Do you have confidence in solving it?" Answer: "It's hard to say!" People will doubt that these words came from the mouth of a communist party member. However, Huang Xiuzhen sat comfortably at home, comforting herself with her own logic: "Meetings have been held, and plans have been made, but the masses are backward and cannot be mobilized; it doesn't rain, what can be done?" If a person treats the suffering of the masses with such a cold heart, it is difficult to ask him to fight for the interests of the masses without fearing difficulties.

When we cannot fully master natural conditions, our agricultural production will inevitably be threatened by various natural disasters. Therefore, this especially requires our rural party organizations and communist party members not to retreat or panic in the face of various disasters, and no matter how serious the difficulties are, they can stand up and lead the masses to fight. Every rural party organization and communist party member should take the Longshou Township and many other party organizations that do not bow to difficulties as examples, cultivate their noble qualities of caring for the suffering of the masses and doing everything for the interests of the masses, and promote the heroic spirit of fighting bravely without fear of difficulties!

    发扬共产党员的英雄气概
    易槐
    修筑康藏公路的英雄们曾经有过这样的豪语：“让高山低头，让河水让路”。正是这种不畏困难、藐视困难的英雄气概，鼓舞他们战胜天险，为人民建立了我们的前人所不敢设想的丰功伟绩。斯大林说过：“困难的存在就是为了让人们与之作斗争并加以克服。”这就是我们共产党人我们这一代人民对待困难的态度。散布在各个工作岗位上的千千万万的共产党员就是用党所经常教导的这种不畏困难的精神去不断地推动党的事业。中共茂名县龙首乡支部领导群众进行的抗旱斗争就充分地体现了共产党人不畏困难的英勇精神。龙首乡的灾荒是那样严重、客观条件那样不好，群众的情绪那样消沉，但是，年轻的龙首乡支部并没有被这样严重的困难吓退。他们说：“群众有灾难，我们就要领导群众向灾难做斗争”，“不管天翻地覆，保证找出水源来。”终于，旱灾被他们战胜了。在那儿，祖先世代流传下来的“这里挖不出泉水”的古话，在这些共产党员面前失去了作用！
    龙首乡支部是一个这样年轻的支部，他们这样顽强的战斗力是从那里来的呢？力量的源泉就在于他们对于群众的痛苦的高度关怀。这个支部是这样同群众共同呼吸的：看着那些已被冻死的作物，支部书记柯振玉就心痛地想着：“群众等着我们出办法啊！”于是立即不眠不休地到处奔跑去鼓舞群众，动员群众，和群众一起商量办法。当农业社和互助组挖成了井，开始抢种时，退出了互助组的中农柯秀轩在偷偷流泪，支部马上感觉到这是五百多户个体农民的苦闷。很快地派出了干部帮助他们组织起来。可惜，并不是所有的党组织和共产党员都能够像龙首乡的支部和党员一样不向困难低头。有这样一些党组织，看到困难，不是惊慌失措退缩不前，就是丢下群众不管，各自去打自己的小算盘。这些党组织和共产党员所以一遇困难就丧失战斗能力，最主要的原因也就是他们对群众的疾苦漠不关心，他们缺乏为了解除群众的痛苦而忍受一切艰难辛苦的高贵品质。中共阳江县第二区区委派驻沙岗乡的工作组组长共产党员黄秀珍就是最突出的例子。今年春天沙岗乡的灾情非常严重，黄秀珍在这个乡住了三、四个月，可从来没有到田地里去过。春荒最严重有些户已经断粮的时候，阳江县委检查组打电话了解这个乡的情况，请看这位工作组长的回答吧！检查组问：“乡里已经种下多少早熟作物？”他回答：“不知道。”“有多少断粮户？”回答是：“还没调查清楚呀！”问：“群众现在怎样解决困难？”答：“打柴、捉鱼！”问：“能解决多少问题？”答：“群众自己打，我怎知道解决多少？”问：“你们准备怎样解决呀？”答：“我还没有想过这件事哩！”问：“有没有信心解决？”答：“很难说！”人们会怀疑这些话是出自一个共产党员之口。但是，黄秀珍却就是这样心安理得地坐在家里，用自己的逻辑安慰自己：“会开过了，计划也订了，但是群众落后，发动不起来；天又不下雨，有什么办法呢？”一个人如果用这样冰冷的心去对待群众的疾苦，就很难要求他能够为群众的利益而不畏困难地进行斗争。
    当我们还不能完全掌握自然条件时，我们的农业生产就不可避免地要经常受到各种自然灾害的威胁。因此，这就特别需要我们农村中的党组织和共产党员在各种灾害面前，不退缩不恐慌，不管困难多么严重，都能够挺身起来领导群众进行战斗。每一个农村党组织和共产党员都应该以龙首乡和其他许许多多不向困难低头的党组织为榜样，培养自己关怀群众疾苦、一切为了群众利益的高贵品质，发扬不怕困难的英勇斗争精神！
