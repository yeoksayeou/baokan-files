    We Must Not Allow Draught Animals to Become Weak and Die
    Zhong Xia
    According to materials from many regions, the phenomenon of draught animals becoming weak and dying is still occurring in some agricultural production cooperatives. The reduction in the number and quality of draught animals has become a serious difficulty for agricultural production cooperatives in carrying out spring plowing.

    The reasons for this phenomenon, in addition to the special difficulties in raising draught animals in some disaster areas, are mainly that some cooperatives, regardless of specific conditions, blindly convert draught animals into public property at a discounted price, resulting in an excessive burden on the cooperatives. After draught animals are collectivized, they lack dedicated management, sufficient fodder, and a proper usage system. Some cooperatives also lack reasonable regulations regarding fodder investment and other methods, so middle peasants are unwilling to invest, and poor peasants cannot afford to. Some cooperatives, due to feed shortages, do not make long-term plans and adopt the method of "big cattle eating small cattle" or "donkeys eating donkeys" (i.e., selling weak and small cattle and donkeys to buy feed) to solve the current feeding problem. Some members believe that the death of an animal will not cost them much individually, so they are not concerned about the feeding and management of draught animals, resulting in the collective animals becoming weaker and dying day by day.

    The proper handling of specific policy issues such as the valuation and remuneration of draught animals joining the cooperative is not only related to the feeding of draught animals in the cooperative and the stability of members' productive enthusiasm but also has a certain impact on farmers outside the cooperative. Agricultural production cooperatives that have real difficulties in collectivized feeding of draught animals and whose members are willing to raise them themselves can change the collectivized feeding method to a private ownership, self-feeding, public-use format. If members still agree to collectivization and it does not overburden the cooperative, the valuation of draught animals should also be as reasonable as possible. If the valuation is too low or the repayment period is too long, members should be persuaded and educated to make adjustments. This is beneficial to draught animal protection and spring plowing production. However, rationally resolving the issue of draught animal valuation upon joining the cooperative is not an easy task. When the working group of Wuming County, Guangxi Province, corrected the phenomenon of low draught animal valuation upon joining the cooperative, cooperative cadres generally resisted the idea. They neither understood the spirit of the policy nor paid attention to the emotions of the members. For example, the livestock valuation of the Qunying Agricultural Production Cooperative was too low. Li Maozai was very fortunate that his cow died before joining the cooperative. When Li Chenglin led his cow into the cooperative, he said to the cow: "Cow, cow, you are worth more dead than alive when you join the cooperative!" After joining the cooperative, he was unwilling to invest in fodder or participate in production. When the working group went to solve this problem, the cooperative cadres rudely said: "If you have any opinions, another criticism of spontaneous forces will solve it." Some cooperatives are unwilling to correct these deviations because they are afraid of trouble. For example, the cadres of Lingchuan Agricultural Production Cooperative said: "It's all low, not just one family. If we adjust one, we have to adjust the whole cooperative." Situations like that in Wuming County are not isolated cases. This shows that the resolution of the draught animal problem and the implementation of mutually beneficial policies require patient persuasion and education. It is necessary to deeply educate cooperative cadres and members, explaining that doing so is beneficial to protecting draught animals and strengthening the unity of middle and poor peasants in production.

    Raising fodder is also a process of implementing policies and strengthening education. According to the experiences of the suburbs of Beijing and Hunyuan, Shanxi, it is necessary to strengthen the collectivist education of cooperative members and mobilize them to jointly find ways to overcome the difficulties in draught animal feed. At the same time, reasonable regulations should be established for fodder investment. Those whose investment exceeds the amount they should bear should be paid a certain amount of interest on the excess to ensure the reasonable interests of investors and encourage investment. Poor peasant members should be educated to make appropriate concessions to middle peasants in terms of investment valuation and interest. At the same time, middle peasant members should also be educated to adopt methods of reducing and deferring payments for poor members to help them overcome the difficulties of being unable to invest. The Xinzhuang Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing initially did not pay attention to these tasks, so some members secretly sold rice straw. Some members said: "If the price the cooperative gives me is appropriate, I will invest in the cooperative. If it is not appropriate, I will sell the straw." After determining reasonable prices and strengthening education for members, the cooperative's fodder investment and other issues were resolved. In addition, the Xianfeng Cooperative in Shenze County, Hebei Province, mobilized members to jointly find ways to "exchange coal for straw." Some cooperatives in Xingtai County whose members lacked straw wanted to sell draught animals. The cooperative cadres mobilized members without livestock to sell straw to members lacking straw or to exchange straw for fertilizer with members with livestock. These methods were used to overcome the fodder shortage. These experiences are worth considering.

    Strengthening the feeding and management of draught animals in cooperatives is also an urgent issue to be resolved. Some cooperative members lack collectivist thinking and do not cherish public draught animals. They rush to use large and strong animals, while small and weak animals are neglected. Sometimes, in order to earn more work points, they drive the animals away before they are full or have had enough to drink, which the masses call using "ruthless cattle." This is also an important reason for the weakness and death of draught animals. How to solve this problem? Some regions have already had successful experiences. Linfen and other counties in Shanxi Province specially held a representative conference of cooperative feeders and veterinarians to examine and criticize the erroneous idea of some feeders that being a "groom" was not glorious, commended feeding models, and studied the usage management system and feeding methods, which played a considerable role in protecting more than 9,000 draught animals in the cooperatives throughout the county. Protective measures should also be studied for privately owned and publicly used draught animals. Some cooperatives in Xingtai have signed usage contracts with livestock households, guaranteeing that the cooperative will not overuse them and protect them well. The livestock households guarantee to prioritize the cooperative and ensure that the livestock are well fed. Remuneration is also calculated separately according to the condition of the livestock and the busy and slack seasons, and members' enthusiasm for protecting livestock is high. All regions should take advantage of the gaps in spring plowing production to hold special livestock protection meetings to study methods, exchange experiences, and solve the problems of feeding and managing draught animals. This is essential for protecting draught animals.

    Taking all measures conducive to protecting draught animals, improving members' enthusiasm and initiative in cherishing and protecting livestock in all aspects, and preventing the continued weakness and death of draught animals are important tasks that agricultural production cooperatives must pay close attention to.

    不能再让耕畜瘦弱、死亡
    仲夏
    据不少地区的材料，有些农业生产合作社的耕畜瘦弱和死亡现象还不断发生；耕畜数量的减少和质量的降低，已成为当前农业生产合作社进行春耕生产的一个严重困难。
    造成这种现象的原因，除部分灾区耕畜饲养有特殊困难外，主要是有些合作社不顾具体条件，盲目把耕畜折价归公，以致合作社负担过重。耕畜归公合槽之后，既缺乏专人管理，又没有足够的草料，使用也没有制度。有些合作社对草料投资等办法也缺乏合理规定，中农不肯投资，贫农又投不起。有些合作社因饲料困难，就不作长期打算，采取“大牛吃小牛”“驴吃驴”的办法（即卖掉弱小牛、驴买饲料）来解决目前饲养问题。有些社员以为死一头牲口，摊不到自己头上多少钱，对耕畜饲养管理不关心，以致集体喂养的牲口一天天地瘦弱死亡。
    耕畜入社折价报酬等具体政策问题的妥善处理，不仅有关合作社的耕畜饲养和社员生产情绪的稳定，对社外农民也有一定影响。耕畜归公饲养确有困难，社员又愿意自养的农业生产合作社，可以把耕畜归公饲养的办法，改为私有自喂公用形式；如社员仍同意公有，又不至使社内负担过重，对耕畜折价也应力求合理，折价过低归还期过长的应说服教育社员加以调整，这样做对耕畜保护和春耕生产都有好处。但是，要合理解决耕畜入社作价问题并不是一件十分容易的事情，广西省武鸣县工作组在纠正耕畜入社作价偏低现象时，合作社干部普遍思想抵触。他们既不了解政策精神，又不注意社员情绪。如群英农业生产合作社牲口作价过低，社员李茂才入社前跌死了牛，自己很庆幸；李成林牵牛入社时，向牛说：“牛呀，牛呀，你活着入社还不如死了值钱呢！”他把耕畜入社后，既不愿投资草料，也不愿参加生产。工作组去解决这个问题的时候，社干部还粗暴地说：“有意见，再批判一次自发势力就解决了。”有些合作社怕麻烦不愿意纠正这些偏向。如灵川农业生产合作社的干部说：“低都低，不只是一家，要调整全社都得调整。”像武鸣县的这种情况并不是个别的。这说明耕畜问题的解决，互利政策的贯彻，需要进行耐心的说服教育，要深入地教育社干部和社员，说明这样做对保护耕畜和加强中、贫农团结生产都有好处。
    饲料的筹集，同样是一个贯彻政策加强教育的过程。据北京郊区和山西浑源等地经验，应加强对社员的集体主义教育，发动他们共同想法克服耕畜饲料困难；同时要合理规定草料投资办法，对投资超过应摊数目者，超额部分应付给一定利息，以保证投资者的合理利益，鼓舞投资兴趣。教育贫农社员在投资作价和利息等方面适当向中农让步；同时也要教育中农社员对贫苦社员，采用少摊缓摊办法，来帮助他们克服无力投资的困难。北京郊区辛庄合作社开始因为没有注意进行这些工作，有些社员偷偷把稻草卖了，有的社员说：“社给我的价钱合适就投到社里，不合适我就把草卖出去。”经过确定合理价格、加强对社员的教育后，这个社的草料投资等问题才解决了。此外，如河北省深泽县先锋社发动社员共同想办法“以煤换草”，邢台县有些合作社的社员因缺草想出卖耕畜，社干部发动没有牲口的社员把草卖给缺草的社员，或者用草和有牲口的社员换肥料，采用这些办法，克服了饲草困难。这些经验都是值得参考的。
    加强合作社的耕畜饲养管理也是一个急待解决的问题。有些合作社社员缺乏集体主义思想，对公有耕畜不爱护，对大的壮的牲口抢着用，小的弱的无人管，有时为了多赚工分不等牲口吃饱饮足就拉上走，群众称这为使“狠心牛”。这也是造成耕畜瘦弱死亡的一个重要原因。怎样解决这一问题，有些地区已有成功的经验。山西临汾等县曾专门召开合作社饲养员和兽医的代表会议，检查并批判了部分饲养员认为是当“马夫”不光荣的错误思想，表扬了饲养模范，研究了使用管理制度和饲养方法，对全县合作社九千多头耕畜的保护，起了相当大的作用。对私有公用的耕畜也要研究保护办法。邢台有些合作社和牲口户订立使用合同，社内保证不过分使用，很好保护；牲口户保证先社后己，并保证把牲口饲养好。在报酬上也按牲口好坏，农忙农闲分别计算工资，社员保畜情绪高涨。各地应利用春耕生产的空隙时间，召开专门的保畜会议，研究办法、交流经验，解决耕畜饲养管理问题。这对保护耕畜是十分必要的。
    采取一切有利于保护耕畜的措施，从各方面提高社员爱畜保畜的热情和积极性，防止发生耕畜继续瘦弱和死亡的现象，是当前农业生产合作社必须十分注意做好的一项重要工作。
