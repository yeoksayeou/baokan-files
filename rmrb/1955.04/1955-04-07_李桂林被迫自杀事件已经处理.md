The case of Li Guilin, a cook at the Yangquan City Industrial Production Cooperative Union in Shanxi Province, being forced to commit suicide (see page 3 of this newspaper on December 24, 1954) has been finalized. After this incident was exposed by the Shanxi Daily and this newspaper, it immediately attracted the attention of the Party and government leading organs of Shanxi Province and Yangquan City. With the assistance of the Shanxi Provincial Political and Legal Committee, the Shanxi Provincial People's Court, and the Shanxi Provincial People's Procuratorate, the Yangquan City People's Court, the Yangquan City People's Procuratorate, and relevant organs, through studying this newspaper's editorial "Dark Corners Must Not Be Allowed to Exist," examined the delayed handling of Li Guilin's forced suicide case and re-established the "Li Guilin Forced Suicide Case" investigation team. After more than two months of investigation and research, the entire truth of the case was finally clarified, and a public trial was held on March 14 to severely punish the villains and bureaucratic elements who persecuted Li Guilin: Wang Tianbao, the principal culprit in the persecution of Li Guilin and former mess hall administrator, was sentenced to 15 years in prison; Zhao Peizhong, former secretary office staff member, was sentenced to 7 years in prison; Zhen Keming, former cadre section chief, was sentenced to 3 years in prison; Wang Liang, a former tea stove worker, was sentenced to one year in prison with a one-year reprieve. Kong Qingshou, the former deputy director of the Industrial Production Cooperative Union specifically responsible for political work, was given an administrative punishment of dismissal and a disciplinary punishment of one year of probation within the Party; Guo Hansan, the deputy director responsible for production work, was given an administrative punishment of a major demerit and a disciplinary punishment of a public warning within the Party.

    In order to learn from the lessons of the "Li Guilin Forced Suicide Case," Xie Zihe, the Mayor of Yangquan City, delivered a report at a city-wide cadre meeting on the afternoon of March 14. In addition to reviewing the errors of the relevant organs in Yangquan City in delaying the handling of the "Li Guilin Forced Suicide Case," he also pointed out that all organs must improve their political vigilance, improve democratic life, and earnestly handle the handling of letters and visits from the masses in the future. He also announced that the 15th of each month would be the mayor's reception day for visits from the masses.

    李桂林被迫自杀事件已经处理
    山西省阳泉市工业生产合作社联合社炊事员李桂林被迫自杀事件（见本报一九五四年十二月二十四日三版）已经最后处理。这个事件经山西日报和本报揭发后，立即引起山西省及阳泉市党、政领导机关的重视。在山西省政法委员会、山西省人民法院、山西省人民检察院的帮助下，阳泉市人民法院、阳泉市人民检察院及有关机关，通过学习本报“不能让黑暗的角落继续存在”的社论，对拖延处理李桂林被迫自杀事件进行了检查，并重新组成了“李桂林被迫自杀事件”调查工作组。经过两个多月的调查、研究，终于查清案件的全部真象，并在三月十四日举行了公开审判大会，对迫害李桂林的恶棍及官僚主义分子进行了严肃处理：判处迫害李桂林的主犯、前伙食管理员王天保有期徒刑十五年；判处前秘书室干事赵培中有期徒刑七年；判处前干部科长甄克明有期徒刑三年；判处前看茶炉的工人王良有期徒刑一年，缓期一年执行；对工业生产合作社联合社专门负责政治工作的前副主任孔庆寿，在行政上给予撤职处分，在党内给予留党察看一年的处分；对负责生产工作的副主任郭汉三，在行政上给予记大过一次处分，在党内给予当众警告处分。
    为了记取“李桂林被迫自杀事件”的教训，阳泉市市长谢子和在三月十四日下午召开的全市干部大会上作了报告。他除检查了阳泉市有关机关对“李桂林被迫自杀事件”拖延处理的错误外，同时指出：各机关今后必须提高政治警惕，健全民主生活，认真做好处理群众来信、来访工作。并宣布：每月十五日为市长接见群众来访时间。
