    Stop the Illegal "Trial" of the German Communist Party
    Tan Wenrui
    April 23rd and 24th are the days of the German people's struggle against the "trial" of the German Communist Party and for the protection of the legitimate rights of the German Communist Party. The German Communist Party called on the German people to launch large-scale actions on these two days to protest the Bonn group's conspiracy to persecute the German Communist Party.
    The Bonn ruling clique's illegal "trial" of the German Communist Party has been going on for five months. This persecution scheme of the German Communist Party by the Bonn group is part of its plan with the American aggressor group to remilitarize West Germany. The German Communist Party is the most loyal defender of the democratic rights and national interests of the German people. It steadfastly strives to restore the peaceful reunification of Germany and opposes the policy of rearming West Germany and dividing Germany. In order to eliminate obstacles on the road to rearming West Germany to launch a new fascist war of aggression, the United States and the Bonn ruling clique falsely accused the German Communist Party of fabricated "crimes," attempting to use this as an excuse to ban the activities of the German Communist Party, to deprive the West German people's movement against remilitarization of leadership, and to facilitate further attacks on all peaceful and democratic forces in West Germany. James Conant, the U.S. High Commissioner for West Germany, told Adenauer that the U.S. State Department believes that banning the German Communist Party is the most important prerequisite for rearming West Germany. Recently, Washington sent a group of legal "experts" to West Germany to help the Bonn government conduct the "trial" of the German Communist Party, so that they can accelerate the implementation of the Paris Accords. Therefore, the German people's struggle against the "trial" of the German Communist Party and for the protection of the legitimate rights of the German Communist Party is of great significance for safeguarding the democratic rights of the German people and the peace of Europe.
    The "trial" of the German Communist Party by the Bonn ruling clique in the Karlsruhe Court is completely a replica of the Leipzig "trial" fabricated by the Hitler fascists in 1933. In the "trial," in order to achieve their shameful purpose of framing the German Communist Party, the Bonn government unscrupulously distorted the program of the German Communist Party, shamelessly fabricated documents and evidence, and unreasonably prevented the representatives of the German Communist Party from defending themselves. However, despite the various despicable means adopted by the Bonn ruling clique, they have put themselves in an embarrassing situation in this persecution scheme. The representatives of the German Communist Party, regardless of various obstacles, carried out a brave struggle in court, powerfully refuting the Bonn government's slanders and calumnies, and defending the theory of Marxism-Leninism and the policy principles of the German Communist Party. They clarified the German Communist Party's firm stance in striving for the restoration of German unity, and pointed out that the implementation of the Paris Accords would create a new threat of war and become a serious obstacle to the reunification of Germany. The German Communists' struggle against the illegal "trial" exposed the West German ruling clique's conspiracy against the peaceful reunification of Germany and attempting to plunge Germany into a third world war, giving new encouragement and impetus to the German people's struggle against the Adenauer group's policies of harming the country and the people and refusing to be dragged into a new war.
    The Adenauer government's illegal "trial" of the German Communist Party was met with strong opposition from the West German people from the very beginning. From the "trial" in Karlsruhe, people from all walks of life more clearly saw the sinister plot of the United States and the Bonn ruling clique to prepare to launch a new war, and they also more deeply realized that the German Communist Party is a reliable standard-bearer in defending their democratic rights and national interests. Therefore, more and more people participated in the struggle to defend the German Communist Party. In the past few months, the masses of people in various parts of West Germany have sent tens of thousands of protest letters to the West German Federal Constitutional Court, and delegations have continuously gone to Karlsruhe to demand the cessation of the illegal "trial." Many cities and industrial centers have also held large-scale demonstrations and rallies to oppose the persecution of the German Communist Party. In these months, more than 8,000 working people have joined the German Communist Party. All this shows that the Bonn ruling clique's illegal "trial" has not been able to weaken the German Communist Party. On the contrary, the influence of the German Communist Party among the West German people is increasing day by day. The patriotic people of West Germany have combined the struggle to defend the German Communist Party with their struggle against the revival of German militarism. They shouted the slogan: "We defend the German Communist Party to defend peace."
      The Chinese people and all peace-loving people around the world resolutely support the just struggle of the German Communist Party and the German people. People of all countries clearly remember that the Hitler gang began its fascist rule in Germany by suppressing the German Communist Party, and then plunged the world into the abyss of war disaster. Peace-loving people of all countries will never allow this history to repeat itself, and must stop the West German militarists' conspiracy to persecute the German Communist Party, and demand that the Bonn group stop the shameful "trial" of the German Communist Party.

    停止对德国共产党的非法“审讯”
    谭文瑞
    四月二十三日和二十四日是德国人民反对“审讯”德国共产党、保护德国共产党的合法权利的斗争日。德国共产党号召德国人民在这两天展开大规模的行动，来抗议波恩集团迫害德国共产党的阴谋。
    波恩统治集团对德国共产党的非法“审讯”已经进行了五个月了。波恩集团对德国共产党的这种迫害阴谋，是它和美国侵略集团图谋使西德重新军国主义化的计划的一部分。德国共产党是德国人民民主权利和民族利益最忠诚的保卫者，它坚持不渝地争取恢复德国的和平统一，反对重新武装西德和分裂德国的政策。美国和波恩统治集团为了扫除它们重新武装西德来发动新的法西斯侵略战争的道路上的障碍，以莫须有的“罪名”诬陷德国共产党，企图以此为借口禁止德国共产党的活动，使西德人民反对重新军国主义化的运动失去领导，并便于进而打击西德一切和平民主的力量。美国驻西德高级专员康南特曾告诉阿登纳说：美国国务院认为，取缔德国共产党是重新武装西德最重要的先决条件。最近华盛顿并派了一批法律“专家”到西德，帮助波恩政府进行对德国共产党的“审讯”，以便使它们能够加速实施巴黎协定。因此，德国人民反对
  “审讯”德国共产党、保卫德国共产党的合法权利的斗争，对于维护德国人民的民主权利和欧洲的和平都有着重要的意义。
    波恩统治集团在加尔斯卢合法院对德国共产党所进行的“审讯”，完全是希特勒法西斯分子一九三三年制造的来比锡“审讯”的翻版。波恩政府在“审讯”中，为了达到他们陷害德国共产党的可耻目的，不惜胡乱歪曲德国共产党的纲领，无耻地捏造文件和证据，无理地阻止德国共产党代表答辩。但是，尽管波恩统治集团采取了各种卑劣的手段，他们在这次迫害阴谋中却使得自己陷入了狼狈的处境。德国共产党的代表不顾各种阻挠，在法庭上进行了勇敢的斗争，有力地驳斥波恩政府的诽谤和诬蔑，捍卫了马克思—列宁主义的理论和德国共产党的政策原则。他们阐明了德国共产党争取恢复德国统一的坚定立场，指出了巴黎协定的实施将造成新的战争威胁并成为重新统一德国的严重障碍。德国共产党人反对非法“审讯”的斗争，揭露了西德统治集团反对和平统一德国、企图把德国投入第三次大战的阴谋，给予德国人民反对阿登纳集团祸国殃民政策、拒绝被拖进新战争的斗争以新的激厉和推进。
    阿登纳政府对德国共产党的非法“审讯”，一开始就受到西德人民的强烈的反对。从加尔斯卢合的“审讯”中，各阶层人民更清楚地看出了美国和波恩统治集团准备发动新战争的罪恶图谋，他们也更深切地认识到，德国共产党是保卫他们的民主权利和民族利益的可靠旗手。因此愈来愈多的人参加了保卫德国共产党的斗争。几个月来，西德各地人民群众向西德联邦宪法法院发出了上万封的抗议书，不断有代表团到加尔斯卢合要求停止非法的“审讯”，许多城市和工业中心并举行了大规模的示威游行和集会，反对迫害德国共产党。在这几个月中，并且有八千多劳动人民参加了德国共产党。这一切都说明，波恩统治集团的非法“审讯”不但没有能削弱德国共产党，相反地德国共产党在西德人民群众当中的影响正日益增加。西德的爱国人民已经把保卫德国共产党的斗争同他们反对复活德国军国主义的斗争结合起来。他们喊出了这样的口号：“我们捍卫德国共产党就是捍卫和平。”
      中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民坚决支持德国共产党和德国人民的正义斗争。各国人民都清楚地记得，希特勒匪帮正是以镇压德国共产党来开始它在德国的法西斯统治，然后把世界投入战争灾难的深渊。各国爱好和平的人民绝不容许这种历史重演，一定要制止西德军国主义者迫害德国共产党的阴谋，要求波恩集团停止对德国共产党的可耻“审讯”。
