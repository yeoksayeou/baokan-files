The American ruling group, in order to conceal its hostility towards the Chinese people, its blatant interference in China's internal affairs, and its unjust acts of aggression against China, has repeatedly fabricated various unfounded lies to slander China. In addition to slandering China for "aggression," "mistreating prisoners of war," "implementing forced labor," and so on, it has also repeatedly fabricated facts to slander China for drug trafficking.

Harry J. Anslinger, the Commissioner of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Narcotics, is one such expert in fabricating rumors to slander China for drug trafficking. Since 1951, this commissioner of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Narcotics, who specializes in using lies to anesthetize the people of the world, has seized every opportunity to peddle his special set of narcotics. Especially during meetings of the Narcotics Committee of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, his primary task has been to fabricate rumors and slander China as much as possible. Not long ago, in early March of this year, he once again continuously slandered China before the Appropriations Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Internal Security Subcommittee of the U.S. Senate, claiming that China was shipping large quantities of narcotics to various parts of the world "as part of a plan to obtain foreign exchange and corrupt the morals of other countries."

But facts are the most merciless enemies of lies.

When Anslinger attended a U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing on the problem of national youth crime on November 23, 1953, he slandered China, saying that he had figures "showing that 70 percent of the heroin trafficked in Los Angeles and 95 percent of the heroin trafficked in San Francisco could be directly traced to contraband imported from Communist China." But the next day, officials of the Los Angeles Police Department denied Anslinger's absurd claims. Eugene Biscailuz, the Sheriff of Los Angeles County, said, "Our main problem is breaking up heroin smuggled in from Mexico." The words of the Commissioner of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Narcotics were denied by responsible American officials in the area. One can imagine how much value there is in what comes out of this commissioner's mouth.

This Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics testified before the Appropriations Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives that "the countries poisoned by the Chinese Communist drug traffickers include Japan, the Republic of Korea, and some Southeast Asian countries." It is interesting to compare what the commissioner said with the information previously (September 1953) revealed by Japanese officials. The Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare revealed that Japan has a well-known drug called "Philopon," which is now being exported to Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Southeast Asian countries through legal sales channels and smuggling. Only two large Japanese pharmaceutical companies are authorized to manufacture "Philopon," but clandestine manufacturing is widespread. The Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare also revealed that there are many cases of private sales of drugs near U.S. military barracks in Japan. Police recently conducted a search and seized 10,000 bottles of drugs near a U.S. military camp in Hokkaido.

As for the so-called Republic of Korea, a spokesman for the U.S. Far East Command publicly admitted on January 28, 1953, that many U.S. soldiers were privately hoarding and selling narcotics in South Korea. And the fact that the U.S. military openly encouraged the sale of opium in South Korea after landing there in September 1945 is even more well-known. United Press reporter Kendrick reported that a South Korean narcotics dealer who "promoted" narcotics to the U.S. military admitted that some of his drugs were "legally" obtained with the approval of the Syngman Rhee government, and his business license was issued by the U.S. military government in 1946.

Anslinger also fabricated the story that "Hong Kong, due to its geographic location and shipping activities, has become an ideal place for Chinese Communist agents to transport narcotics into the free world." However, Anslinger's fabrication has long been refuted by news from Hong Kong. The London "Times" published a Hong Kong dispatch on May 8, 1952, which said, "The drug trafficking through Hong Kong mentioned in the report made by U.S. Federal Bureau of Narcotics Commissioner Anslinger to the United Nations this week is quite surprising here." It also said that for a long time, "there has been no evidence of drug business from mainland China."

Let us take a look at the drug trafficking and drug use situation in the United States. There is a lot of material on this. According to news reports, in large cities like New York, people openly plant North American marijuana, which can be used as a narcotic. According to a report in the "New York Times" on August 22, 1953, the New York City Department of Health harvested 350 pounds of North American marijuana in the backyard of a house at 82 Butler Street in Brooklyn. Thomas Warden Jr., a former Assistant U.S. Attorney, published an article in the U.S. "Saturday Evening Post" on October 3, 1953, stating that the warehouse of the U.S. Treasury Department, which stores the drugs seized over the years, had been stolen by a cleaning worker over a period of two and a half years, with as much as 150 ounces of cocaine and 50 to 75 pounds of North American marijuana. On the illegal market, these drugs were worth about $250,000. In addition, Captain Capo, the head of the Narcotics Squad of the Washington, D.C., Police Department, and Sergeant Taylor, a detective, accepted bribes of $1,000 per month to protect the thriving illegal narcotics trafficking business in Washington. The captain had also acted as a delivery man for drug dealers at least once.

Warden said in his article: "Commissioner Anslinger has made some public statements attempting to slander our arguments. However, he finally admitted that there may have been some 'theft' in the warehouse... The investigation revealed that no one in the Narcotics Bureau could say exactly how many narcotics were in the warehouse at any given time."

Precisely because American officials like Anslinger are so vigorously protecting the "thriving narcotics business," the phenomenon of "drug poisoning" in the United States is appalling. As early as 1951, "Newsweek" magazine admitted that even in American schools, a solid market for organized drug trafficking had been established, and estimated that about 2,000 drug dealers in New York supplied 30,000 drug users, half of whom were teenagers, according to the New York City Police Department. Anslinger himself also admitted that the number of drug users in the United States increased by 10,000 to 15,000 from 1948 to 1954. There are also a large number of soldiers in the U.S. military who use drugs. U.S. Cardinal Spellman admitted after returning to the United States from visiting the front lines in Korea that "young people who use drugs apparently became addicted before enlisting in the military in the United States."

The above facts show that it is not any other country that is using narcotics to undermine the morals of the so-called "free world," including the United States, but precisely the United States itself.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have fundamentally eradicated all the foul and evil practices left over by imperialism and feudal forces, including opium and drugs. China is no longer a "sick man of East Asia" that can be bullied, but has become a giant standing tall in the world. This is what the American masters like Anslinger, who want to keep the Chinese people under their feet forever, deeply resent. Therefore, they do not hesitate to fabricate all kinds of lies to slander this giant. But as the Chinese proverb says, "True gold fears no fire." The only effect that lies of the Anslinger type can produce is to expose their own shamelessness and depravity.

    美国联邦麻醉品局局长的“麻醉品”
    基成
    美国统治集团为了掩饰它敌视中国人民、蛮横地干涉中国内政和侵略中国的不义行为，就一再制造各种毫无事实根据的谎言来诬蔑中国。除了诬蔑中国“进行侵略”、“虐待战俘”、“实行强迫劳动”等等以外，它还一再地捏造事实，诬蔑中国贩毒。
    美国联邦麻醉品局局长哈里·杰·安斯林格就是一个诬蔑中国贩毒的造谣专家。自从一九五一年以来，这位专以谎言来麻醉世界人民的美国联邦麻醉品局局长年年都要寻找机会把他那套特殊的麻醉品拿出来贩卖一通，特别是在联合国经济及社会理事会麻醉品委员会开会的时候，他的主要任务就是尽量造谣诬蔑中国。不久以前，即今年三月初，他又在美国众议院拨款委员会和美国参议院国内安全小组委员会上连续诬蔑中国正在向世界各地运出大量的麻醉品，“作为取得外汇和败坏他国道德的计划的一部分。”
    但是事实是谎言的最无情的敌人。
    安斯林格于一九五三年十一月二十三日出席一个研究全国青年犯罪问题的美国参议院司法小组会时曾诬蔑中国说，他有一些数字“显示在洛杉矶贩运的海洛英的百分之七十和旧金山贩运的百分之九十五都可直接追溯到来自共产党中国的违禁进口品。”可是第二天，洛杉矶的警察局官员就否认了安斯林格这种谰言。洛杉矶县警察局局长尤金·比斯卡鲁兹说：“我们的主要问题是在于破获自墨西哥走私进来的海洛英。”美国联邦麻醉品局局长所说的话，既为当地美国负责官员所否认。那末可想而知，从这位局长嘴巴中吐出来的东西会有几分价值。
    这位联邦麻醉品局局长在美国众议院拨款委员会作证时曾经说，“受中共麻醉品贩卖者毒害的国家中有日本、大韩民国以及某些东南亚国家。”拿这位局长所说的话来和日本官方以前（一九五三年九月）所透露的消息比较一下，倒是饶有兴味的。日本厚生省透露，日本有一种大家都知道的“菲洛本”药，现在也有人把这种药以合法的销售方式和通过走私输往香港、台湾和东南亚各国。只有两家日本的大制药公司获准制造“菲洛本”，但是暗中制造的很普遍。日本厚生省又透露，在日本美军营房所在地附近私售毒品的事件极多。警察最近进行了一次搜查，在北海道的美国军营附近，查封了一万瓶药品。
    至于所谓大韩民国，那末一九五三年一月二十八日美国远东司令部发言人就曾经公开承认，许多美国军人在南朝鲜私藏和贩卖麻醉品。而一九四五年九月美军在南朝鲜登陆以来就公开奖励贩卖鸦片，这更是尽人皆知的事实。合众社的记者肯德立克就报道过，一个向美军“推销”麻醉药品的南朝鲜麻醉药品贩子承认，他的药品的一部分是“合法地”从李承晚政府批准得来的，而他的营业执照是一九四六年由美国军政府发给的。
    安斯林格又无中生有地说，“香港由于地理位置和水运活动，成为共产党中国代理人把麻醉品运入自由世界的理想场所。”可是，安斯林格这种捏造早已被香港方面的消息所推翻了。一九五二年五月八日伦敦“泰晤士报”刊载过一篇香港通讯，这篇通讯说，“美国联邦麻醉品局局长安斯林格本星期向联合国所作的报告中提到了途经香港的毒品贩运，此间对此颇为诧异。”又说，很久以来，“没有证据说有来自中国大陆的药品生意”。
    让我们再来看看美国的贩毒和吸毒的情况。关于这方面的材料是不少的。据新闻报道，在纽约那样的大城市，就有人公然种植可作麻醉品的北美大麻。一九五三年八月二十二日“纽约时报”的消息说，纽约市的卫生局在布鲁克林区白脱勒街八十二号那房屋的后院收割了三百五十磅的北美大麻。美国前助理检察官小汤麦斯·瓦登于一九五三年十月三日在美国“星期六晚邮报”发表文章说，美国财政部贮藏历年来所没收的毒品的仓库，曾被一名打扫人员于两年半的期间内陆续盗窃出古柯咸一百五十唡和北美大麻五十磅到七十五磅之多。在非法的市场上，这许多毒品约值二十五万美元。此外美国华盛顿警察局专管麻醉品的小队长卡波上尉和侦查员泰勒上士接受每月一千美元的贿赂以保护华盛顿旺盛的麻醉品非法贩运事业。那位小队长还至少有一次做过贩卖毒品者的送货员。
    瓦登在他那篇文章中又说：“安斯林格局长曾发表一些公开声明，企图对我们的论据进行诽谤。然而，他终于承认，对于库房也许有过某种“偷窃”行为……调查结果显示，麻醉品局没有一个人能够说出在某一特定的时间，库房中究竟有多少麻醉品。”
    正因为安斯林格之流的美国官员这样出力地保护“旺盛的麻醉品事业”，美国“毒化”的现象十分惊人。早在一九五一年，美国“新闻周刊”就承认，甚至在美国的学校中也已经建立了有组织的毒品贩卖的巩固市场，并且估计纽约约有两千名毒贩供应三万吸食者，据纽约市警察局统计，其中一半是十几岁的少年人。安斯林格本人也供认，美国吸毒人数自一九四八年至一九五四年增加了一万到一万五千名。在美国军队中，也有大量士兵吸食毒品。美国红衣主教斯培尔曼曾经在访问朝鲜前线后回到美国时承认，“吸食毒品的青年显然都是在美国国内参军以前就开始上瘾的。”
    以上种种事实表明，以麻醉品来破坏包括美国在内的所谓“自由世界”的道德的不是什么别的国家，而恰恰是美国自己。
    我们中华人民共和国自从成立以来，已经从根本上把帝国主义、封建势力所遗留下来的包括烟毒在内的一切乌烟瘴气肃清了。中国已经不再是一个可以被人欺凌的“东亚病夫”，而成为一个屹立在世界上的巨人。这是那些想永远把中国人民踩在脚下的安斯林格之流的美国老爷们所深恶痛绝的，因此他们不惜捏造种种的谎言来中伤这个巨人。但是中国的谚语说得好：“真金不怕火”。安斯林格之流的谎言所能产生的效果只有暴露他们自己的无耻和下流而已。
