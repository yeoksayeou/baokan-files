    Nanwan Reservoir is Racing to Build the Dam
    The people building the Nanwan Reservoir are working day and night selflessly to ensure that the dam is built to a safe elevation before the flood season.
    Currently, the reservoir's water conveyance project (including the intake tower, tunnel, and stilling basin) has been fully completed. The spillway project, except for a portion that is still being deepened, has been excavated and prepared. The current central task is to concentrate efforts on building the dam. The dam foundation treatment work was successfully completed on March 16th, and the riverbed dam body began to be built and compacted on March 17th. The dam body is constructed with earth, sand, and stone materials, forming a composite cross-section dam body. The dam is thirty-three meters high and seven hundred and twenty-nine and a half meters long. Building such a large dam requires two million three hundred and sixty thousand cubic meters of earth, sand, and stone materials. These earth, sand, and stone materials are transported from places several kilometers, or even tens of kilometers away.
    In the labor emulation campaign, many heroic and model deeds have emerged. For example, the locomotive driven by compaction worker Song Zibin created a new record of compacting four thousand five hundred square meters in eight hours, exceeding the quota by eighty percent. (Huang Xianliu)

    南湾水库正在赶筑大坝
    建设南湾水库的人们为了保证在汛前把大坝筑到安全高程，正夜以继日地进行忘我的劳动。
    目前，水库的输水道工程（包括进水塔、隧洞和静水池）已全部完成，溢洪道工程除一部分尚在下挖加深外，其余都已开凿就绪。当前的中心任务是集中力量堆筑拦河坝。坝基处理工作已在三月十六日胜利结束，三月十七日河槽坝身即已开始进行堆筑辗压。坝身采用土、沙、石料，构成复合式的断面坝身。大坝高三十三公尺，长七百二十九点五公尺。堆筑这样一个大坝，需要二百三十六万公方的土、沙、石料。这些土、沙、石料都是从几公里，甚至几十公里远的地方运来的。
    在劳动竞赛运动中，出现了许多英雄模范事迹。如碾压工人宋子彬驾驶的机车，就创造了八小时碾压四千五百平公方的新纪录，超过定额百分之八十。（黄先流）
