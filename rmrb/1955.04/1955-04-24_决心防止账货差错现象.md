    Determined to Prevent Discrepancies Between Accounts and Goods
    A letter from the Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Hardware and Machinery Company: The criticism from readers on the “Reader’s Letters Page” on April 3 regarding the question of "Where did one hundred tons of steel go?" is completely correct.

    The main reasons for this error are our unsound working system, neglect of management work, irresponsibility of some staff towards state property, and the strong presence of a purely task-oriented viewpoint. More importantly, we lacked education for our cadres and failed to conduct timely inspections of our work. As a result, although discrepancies between accounts and goods occurred constantly, they did not attract our attention. When the Jinan City Company of the China Hardware and Machinery Company stated that they had an excess of fifty-eight tons of round steel and asked us to verify, we subjectively believed that this batch of steel was not from our station, and thus agreed to the Jinan City Company handling this batch of steel themselves in the 1954 final accounting. This shows that we still lacked sufficient understanding of the chaotic situation in our work, which led to our failure to find the root cause of the errors for a long time.

    After the problem of the missing one hundred tons of steel was discovered, we sent personnel to the Jinan City Company for detailed verification, which proved that we had indeed mistakenly transported these steel materials to Jinan. This error resulted in a loss of 5,404 yuan in goods payment interest. To learn from this incident, we have decided to conduct an inspection of our operational management procedures and systems in the near future, mobilize all employees to participate in discussions, improve the system, strengthen ideological education for cadres, and reduce and eliminate such errors in future work.

专栏：批评建议的反应

    决心防止账货差错现象
    中国五金机械公司天津采购供应站来信：四月三日“读者来信专页”上读者揭发的关于“一百吨钢哪里去了”的问题，对我们的批评是完全正确的。
    产生这种错误的主要原因，是我们的工作制度不够健全，忽视了管理工作，部分工作人员对国家财产不负责任，存在着浓厚的单纯任务观点。更重要的是我们对干部缺乏教育，没有及时对工作进行检查，因此，虽然账货差错现象不断发生，却没有引起我们的重视。当中国五金机械公司济南市公司声明多余元钢五十八吨让我们进行查对时，我们却主观地认为这批钢材不是我站的，于是就同意济南市公司对这批钢材在一九五四年决算中自行处理。这说明我们对工作中的混乱情况还缺乏足够的认识，以致长期没有找出错误的根源。
    丢失一百吨钢材的问题发现以后，我们派专人到济南市公司进行了详细查对，证明我们确实把这些钢材错运到济南去了。这一错误共损失货款利息五千四百零四元。为了接受这一事件的教训，我们决定在最近进行一次经营管理手续制度方面的检查，发动全体职工进行讨论，健全制度，加强对干部的思想教育，在今后的工作中减少和消除这样的错误。
