Xinhua News Agency:

    The Romanian drilling team, which has been working in the Jiuquan Basin for more than a year supporting China, has successfully completed the drilling task of a deep exploratory well – the "Friendship Well." On the evening of April 5th, the workers of the Yumen Oil Mine held a grand farewell party. At the farewell party, the workers of the Yumen Oil Mine presented the Romanian drilling team with a silk banner and gifts such as ceremonial wax produced by the oil mine and jade cups from Jiuquan.
    The Romanian drilling team arrived in the Jiuquan Basin in February 1954 to support China. This team was equipped with drilling engineers, drilling captains, and drillers. Together with a Chinese drilling team, they drilled a deep exploratory well in a promising oil-bearing structure in the Jiuquan Basin. This well was drilled to a depth of 2,377 meters and is currently being prepared for oil testing.
    For more than a year, the Romanian drilling team supporting China has persisted in working in the field day and night, regardless of wind or snow. Through the drilling of the "Friendship Well," they passed on the Romanian system of deep exploratory well drilling technology and experience to China's drilling workers. They have also provided many valuable suggestions for the work of the Jiuquan Drilling Division.

    酒泉盆地“友谊之井”已钻成
    在酒泉盆地工作了一年多的罗马尼亚支援中国钻井队，现已胜利完成一口深探井——“友谊之井”的钻井任务。四月五日晚上，玉门油矿职工举行盛大的欢送会。在欢送大会上，玉门油矿职工赠送给罗马尼亚支援中国钻井队一面锦旗和油矿出产的礼蜡、酒泉的玉石杯等礼品。
    罗马尼亚支援中国钻井队一九五四年二月来到酒泉盆地。这个队配备有钻井工程师、钻井队长和钻工，他们协同我国的一个钻井队，在酒泉盆地一个希望很大的储油构造上钻凿了一口深探井。这口井钻了二千三百七十七公尺深，目前正准备试油。
    罗马尼亚支援中国钻井队一年多来，不论白天黑夜，刮风下雪，都坚持在野外工作，并通过“友谊之井”的钻凿，把罗马尼亚系统的钻凿深探井的技术和经验传授给我国的钻井工人。他们对酒泉钻探处的工作，也提出了不少宝贵的建议。   （新华社）
