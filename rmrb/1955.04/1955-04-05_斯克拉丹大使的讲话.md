    Ambassador Skraadan's Speech
    Dear Comrades! Dear Friends!
    On April 4, 1945, the glorious Soviet army finally liberated Hungary from fascist enslavement. Thus, for the first time in history, Hungary became a free and independent nation, and the working people became the masters of the country.
    Since the liberation ten years ago, thanks to the consistent assistance of the Soviet Union, the Hungarian people, under the leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party, have achieved tremendous political, economic, and cultural successes. By implementing a socialist planned economy and through unremitting work, the Hungarian people have all the necessary conditions to defend their freedom and independence and continuously improve their living standards. Today in Hungary, every working person has prospects for development, and there is no more exploitation or unemployment. The working class is supplying the country with more and more coal, steel, and machines. Thanks to the development of agricultural production cooperatives, our farmers are able to supply more and more grain. Our intellectuals are beautifying the lives of our people with their scientific research, creative work, and artistic activities.
    Our working people are closely united under the banner of the Patriotic People's Front and work hard. If necessary, they will fight for their motherland and peace. The Hungarian working people's desire for peace can be evidenced by the following facts: They resolutely oppose atomic weapons, oppose the re-establishment of West German forces threatening peace, and condemn foreign interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China.
    Our liberated people believe in the noble ideas of Lenin and Stalin. Our lives and work are based on this. We respect the rights and independence of other countries and have no territorial claims. We are willing to establish friendly relations with every country.
    Today—on the tenth anniversary of Hungary's liberation—the Hungarian people are jubilantly celebrating this great festival, proclaiming their desire for peace and freedom, and emphatically expressing their gratitude and love for the Soviet Union. To this end, I propose that we raise our glasses to the great Soviet Union, to the Soviet working people and the invincible Soviet army, and to world peace!
    Dear Comrades! Dear Guests!
    Since liberation, Hungary has rebuilt its own country and adjusted its international relations. It has broken away from its past isolation and has done its best to establish friendly relations with all countries, especially with the Soviet Union and other people's democracies.
    We have established trade and cultural relations with the People's Republic of China, which is of particular significance to us. Although our two countries are geographically far apart, our wishes and goals are the same. We are both engaged in socialist construction and defending peace in the big family of free peoples. Our people not only closely follow the great achievements of the Chinese people in industry, agriculture, and culture, but also pay close attention to their struggle for the freedom and independence of their motherland, and their struggle for peace and against imperialist interference.
    The heroic cause of the Chinese people and their success fill us with infinite joy. We are proud to be friends of the great Chinese people. We are very pleased that the relations between China and Hungary are growing stronger and developing. I propose a toast to the eternal friendship between the people of China and Hungary, and to the health of Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people!

    斯克拉丹大使的讲话亲爱的同志们！亲爱的朋友们！
    一九四五年四月四日，光荣的苏联军队最后从法西斯奴役下解放了匈牙利。于是，匈牙利在历史上第一次成为一个自由独立的国家，劳动人民成了国家的主人。
    自从解放十年以来，由于苏联一贯的帮助，我国人民在匈牙利劳动人民党的领导下，获得了政治、经济和文化上的巨大成就。由于执行了社会主义计划经济，由于进行了不懈的工作，匈牙利人民有一切必要条件来保卫自己的自由和独立，并且不断地提高生活水平。今天在匈牙利，每一个从事劳动的人都有发展的前途，再也没有剥削和失业现象了。工人阶级为国家供给愈来愈多的煤、钢铁和机器。由于农业生产合作社的发展，我国农民能够供给愈来愈多的粮食。我国知识分子用自己的科学研究、创造性的工作和艺术活动美化着我国人民的生活。
    我国劳动人民紧密地团结在爱国人民阵线的旗帜下努力工作，必要时，他们是会为自己的祖国与和平而战斗的。匈牙利劳动人民的和平愿望，可以从下列这些事实得到证明：他们坚决反对原子武器，反对重新建立威胁和平的西德军队，谴责外国对于中华人民共和国内政的干涉。
    解放了的我国人民信仰列宁、斯大林的崇高思想。我们的生活和工作都是以此为基础的。我们尊重别国人民的权利和独立，我们没有任何领土的要求。我们愿意和每一个国家建立友好的关系。
    在今天——匈牙利解放十周年纪念日，匈牙利人民欢欣鼓舞地庆祝这个伟大的节日，并且宣告他们爱好和平和自由的愿望、着重地表明他们对于苏联的感激和爱戴。为此，我建议我们举杯为伟大的苏联，为苏联劳动人民和无敌的苏联军队，为世界和平而干杯！
    亲爱的同志们！亲爱的来宾们！
    解放以后，匈牙利一方面重建自己的国家，一方面调整国际关系，摆脱了过去的孤立状态，并且尽力和各国建立友好关系，首先是和苏联和各人民民主国家。
    我们和中华人民共和国建立了贸易和文化关系，这对于我们是具有特别重大意义的事。尽管我们两国在地理上相距很远，我们的愿望和目标是一致的，我们都在进行社会主义的建设，都在自由人民的大家庭里保卫和平。我国人民不仅密切注视着中国人民在工业、农业和文化方面的巨大成就，而且十分关怀他们为了自己祖国的自由和独立而进行的斗争，关怀他们争取和平、反对帝国主义干涉的斗争。
    中国人民的英勇事业和他们获得的成功，使我们感到无限欢欣鼓舞。我们是伟大的中国人民的朋友，这是我们引以为骄傲的事。我们非常高兴中匈两国间的关系日益加强，日益发展。我提议为中匈两国人民永恒的友谊干杯，为中国人民的领袖毛泽东同志的健康干杯！
