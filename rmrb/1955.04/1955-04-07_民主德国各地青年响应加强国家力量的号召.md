Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 6th: According to the German News Agency, the "Neues Deutschland" (New Germany) newspaper, the organ of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, issued a call in its April 3rd editorial to strengthen the power of the German Democratic Republic, which has been widely echoed among workers, especially young workers, across the country. In thousands of declarations, workers expressed their belief that it is necessary to strengthen the German Democratic Republic due to the ratification of the Paris Agreements, which will transform West Germany into a hotbed of military provocation.

Prior to this call, nearly one hundred local organizations of the Free German Youth League held meetings. At these meetings, hundreds of young people pledged to join the police force.

    民主德国各地青年响应加强国家力量的号召
    据新华社柏林六日电　据德意志通讯社报道：德国统一社会党机关报“新德意志报”在四月三日的社论中发出的关于加强德意志民主共和国力量的号召，已经在全国各地的工人，特别是青年工人当中获得了广泛的响应。工人们在成千份宣言中表示了他们的信念：由于批准了将使西德变成为军事挑衅的策源地的巴黎协定，就有必要加强德意志民主共和国。
    在这个号召发出以前，自由德国青年联盟的将近一百个地方组织举行了会议。在这些会议上，成百个青年保证要参加警察部队。
