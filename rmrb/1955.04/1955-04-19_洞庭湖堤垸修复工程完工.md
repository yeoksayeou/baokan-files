The massive Dongting Lake dike restoration project has been successfully completed by 850,000 workers, farmers, and cadres in Hunan Province after four and a half months of intensive work. The 4,710-kilometer-long dikes now protect six million mu of fertile land around Dongting Lake like a series of long city walls. These dikes are sufficient to withstand floods like those of 1949. The key repaired dikes, known as "Golden Dikes," firmly protect two million mu of fertile land, unafraid of the invasion of extraordinary floods like those of 1954.

During this period, more than 86 million cubic meters of earth and stone work were completed, two modern large-scale sluice gates, five medium-sized culvert gates, and eighteen small stone culverts were built, and sixty-two river mouths were blocked. While restoring the large dikes, various places also straightened the flood channels of the Yuan and Li Rivers, excavated more than 17,000 meters of river channel, and removed more than 53,000 meters of water-obstructing abandoned dikes, separating the Yuan and Li Rivers so that they can no longer invade the fertile land along Dongting Lake together. The downstream flows of the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li Rivers all flow obediently into Dongting Lake along the flood channels prescribed by the people. Three million people around Dongting Lake will now be able to carry out production with peace of mind and strive for a continuous bumper harvest in the "granary" of the motherland.

The workers and farmers participating in the dike restoration created many advanced working methods in tasks such as carrying and digging earth. The average work efficiency of many model teams often remained above seven cubic meters. More than 700,000 tons of materials supported by various places ensured the smooth progress of the project.

    洞庭湖堤垸修复工程完工
    湖南省八十五万工人、农民和干部经过四个半月的战斗，已胜利地完成了规模浩大的洞庭湖堤垸修复工程。四千七百一十公里长的堤垸，像一道道漫长的城墙一样把洞庭湖畔六百万亩良田卫护起来。这些堤垸足以战胜一九四九年那样的洪水。被人称做“金堤”的重点整修的堤垸，牢牢地保卫着二百万亩良田，不怕一九五四年那样的特大洪水的侵犯。
    这个期间，各地完成了八千六百多万公方的土石方工程，筑起了两座现代化的大型水闸、五座中型涵闸和十八座小型石涵，堵死了六十二处河口。在修复大垸的同时，各地还整理了沅水和澧水的洪道，开挖了一万七千多公尺的河道，刨除了五万三千多公尺的阻水废堤，把沅水和澧水分开，使它们不能再一道来侵犯洞庭湖边的良田。湘、资、沅、澧四水下游的流水，都驯服地按着人们所规定的洪道流入洞庭湖。洞庭湖畔三百万人民今后将能安心地进行生产，争取祖国“粮仓”经常丰收。
    参加修复大垸的工人、农民在挑土、挖土等工作中创造了许多先进工作方法。许多模范小组的平均工效，经常保持在七公方以上。各地支援的七十多万吨物资，保证了工程的顺利进行。
