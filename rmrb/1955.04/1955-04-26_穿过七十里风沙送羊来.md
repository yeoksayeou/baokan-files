　　Delivering Sheep Through Seventy Li of Wind and Sand
　　Bu Guang

　　There is a stone mountain here that people call Black Mountain. There are no inhabitants within thirty or forty li around the mountain. As far as the eye can see, it is a desert, sparsely covered with camel grass. However, this place is truly lovely because it contains a large amount of coal underground. The employees of the Northwest Geological Bureau's 625 Exploration Team have erected canvas tents here to carry out coalfield exploration work.

　　The lives of the exploration team members working here are very difficult. It is hard to get fresh vegetables all year round. To improve the diet of the employees, the comrades responsible for general affairs bought fourteen sheep through the Hongshui Township People's Government. Unfortunately, the sheep were not properly penned, and the next morning, they all ran away. The team sent several comrades to search everywhere, but they couldn't find a trace even when it got dark. The comrades all said that they might have been eaten by wolves.

　　Seven days, eight days, and there was still no news of the sheep. On the ninth day, a strong wind swept up yellow sand, and the weather became very cold! Just then, someone shouted, "Our sheep are back!" Everyone looked closely and saw an old man braving the wind and sand, driving fourteen sheep towards the construction site.

　　The comrades brought the old man water to wash his face. After he washed, they gathered around the stove and started talking. Someone asked the old man his name. Someone asked where he lived. The old man said, "My name is Cai Shujin. I live in Hongshui Township, more than seventy li away from here, not far." The old man paused and then said, "That day, as soon as I went out, I saw a dozen sheep grazing. I wondered whose sheep were out so early, probably escaped from the pen. I went to the Township People's Government to report it, but after asking around, no one had lost any sheep. Later, I found out they belonged to your team. Fearing that the comrades would be worried, the township head wrote a letter, and I drove the sheep back."

　　"It's so cold, you..."

　　"It doesn't matter if it's a little cold," the old man interjected, "If it were a day later, how worried the comrades would be!"

　　The next morning, after breakfast, the team offered the old man some travel expenses, but he refused to accept them, saying, "It doesn't matter whether you give me money or not, the people here are all watching and hoping that you find treasures sooner!" Only after the comrades repeatedly persuaded him did he reluctantly accept.

　　After the old man left, the comrades were all moved and said: The folks here love us, how much they hope that we can explore coal sooner! We must work harder and never disappoint the folks!

    穿过七十里风沙送羊来
    步光
    这里有座石头山，人们都叫它黑山，山的周围三、四十里以内没有人烟，一眼望去，是一片沙漠，沙漠上长着稀疏的骆驼草。但是，这个地方却实在可爱，因为地底下蕴藏着大量的煤。西北地质局六二五勘探队的职工们，就在这里撑起一顶顶帆布帐篷，进行着煤田勘探工作。
    在这里工作的勘探队员们的生活是十分艰苦的，一年四季，很难吃到些新鲜蔬菜。负责总务的同志们为了改进职工伙食，通过红水乡人民政府买了十四只羊。可是很不巧，羊没圈好，第二天一早，羊全都跑了。队上派了几个同志，四处寻找，一直找到天黑，连个踪影也没有。同志们都说可能被狼吃掉了。
    七天、八天，羊仍然没有消息。第九天，大风卷着黄沙，气候变得很冷！就在这时，有人喊道：“我们的羊回来了！”大家定睛一看，一位老大爷冒着风沙，赶着十四只羊朝工地走来。
    同志们给老大爷打来了洗脸水，请老大爷洗过脸，就围着老大爷在火炉旁边谈起来了。有人问老大爷的名字叫啥？有人问老大爷家住那里？老大爷说：“我叫蔡书金，家住红水乡，离这里七十多里路，不远。”老大爷停了停又说：“那天天刚亮，我一出门就看见十来只羊在啃草，我想谁家的羊这么早就出来了，说不定是从圈里偷跑出来的。我就跑到乡人民政府去报告，可是打问来打问去，谁家也没有跑掉羊，后来一打问，才知道是咱们队上的，怕同志们着急，乡长写了封信，我就把羊赶回来了。”
      “天这样冷，你……”
    “冷点倒没关系，”老大爷抢过去说：“要是迟一天，同志们该多着急啊！”
    第二天早饭后，队上送给老大爷一些路费，可是说啥他也不收，他说：“给钱不给钱不要紧，我们这里人眼睛都瞧着你们早些找出宝来！”经同志们再三劝说，才勉强收下了。
    老大爷走后，同志们都感动地说：这里的老乡热爱我们，多么盼望我们早些勘探出煤来啊！我们一定得加油干，决不能使老乡失望！
