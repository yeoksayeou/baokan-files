The Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry has overfulfilled the first quarter production plan for five major products. Among them, iron ore completed 102.98 percent of the plan, metallurgical coke completed 102.03 percent, pig iron completed 101.77 percent, steel completed 104.68 percent, and rolled steel products completed 101.97 percent.

During the first quarter production, the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau focused on organizing and promoting several advanced experiences of great significance. Due to the adoption of new coal blending ratios in coking, Benxi Iron and Steel Company increased the coking rate by 4.3 percent, and Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant increased the coking rate by 1.56 percent. In ironmaking, due to the continued implementation of steam blowing operation methods, the smooth operation of blast furnaces was adjusted, and the output was increased. Benxi Iron and Steel Company's blast furnace utilization coefficient increased by 2.99 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 1954. In steelmaking, enterprises gradually and universally promoted the advanced experience of "thick-layer burning repair" of furnace bottoms, and the overall open hearth furnace hot repair rate decreased by 29.32 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 1954. Open hearth furnace production units also developed the advanced experience of rapid cold repair of open hearth furnaces, and implemented the Soviet expert's suggestion of rapid furnace baking curve, the overall open hearth furnace cold repair time was shortened by 23.64 percent compared with the plan. Some enterprises have also achieved certain achievements in promoting fixed-batch steelmaking and steel rolling. In addition, employees of various enterprises also suggested and improved some production equipment and technical operations. Workers in the rolling mill workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 successfully created a universal pass design, which can reduce the number of roll changes and increase operating time. The plant also successfully manufactured cast steel main frames for railway car bodies by vertical casting, which strongly supported the construction of railway transportation. The factories under the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau have also successfully trial-produced some new products and expanded the variety of products.

    钢铁工业局完成第一季主要产品生产计划
    重工业部钢铁工业管理局已超额完成了第一季度五种主要产品的生产计划。其中铁矿石完成计划百分之一百零二点九八，冶金焦完成百分之一百零二点零三，生铁完成百分之一百零一点七七，钢完成百分之一百零四点六八，钢压延品完成百分之一百零一点九七。
    在第一季度生产中，钢铁工业管理局有重点地组织推广了几项具有重大意义的先进经验。由于在炼焦方面采用了新配煤比，本溪钢铁公司提高了结焦率百分之四点三，石景山钢铁厂提高了结焦率百分之一点五六。在炼铁方面由于继续推行了蒸汽鼓风的操作方法，调节了高炉顺行，提高了产量，本溪钢铁公司高炉利用系数即比一九五四年第四季度提高百分之二点九九。在炼钢方面，各企业逐步地普遍推行了“厚层烧补”炉底的先进经验，全局平炉热修率比一九五四年第四季度降低了百分之二十九点三二。各平炉生产单位并发展了平炉快速冷修的先进经验，执行了苏联专家快速烘炉曲线的建议，全局平炉冷修时间比计划共缩短了百分之二十三点六四。有些企业在推行定料炼钢方面和轧钢方面也取得了一定的成就。此外，各企业的职工还建议和改进了一些生产设备和技术操作，上海钢铁三厂轧钢车间工人创造成功了万能孔型，可以减少换辊次数，增加作业时间。该厂还立浇火车车身铸钢主架成功，有力地支援了铁路运输的建设。钢铁工业管理局所属工厂还试制成功了一些新产品，并扩大了产品品种。
