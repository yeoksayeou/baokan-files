Guangdong Province has experienced a relatively severe spring drought this year. Many areas face water shortages in the rice paddies, making it impossible to sow seeds. In some regions, winter crops have also suffered from frost damage, leading to emerging signs of crop failure. To prevent and overcome the disaster, Party and government organizations at all levels in Guangdong Province have allocated additional agricultural loans and relief funds to support farmers in spring plowing and to address the living difficulties of some farmers. They are also actively leading farmers in fighting drought and sowing seeds. The Fourth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Gaoyao County led farmers in eleven townships, including Xinjiang and Shatou, to build a dam across the Xinxing River to irrigate more than 30,000 mu of rice paddies. Farmers in Chao'an, Chenghai, Jieyang, Raoping and other counties on the Chaoshan Plain blocked the Han River to divert water for drought resistance, relieving the threat of spring drought to approximately 800,000 mu of farmland. Thanks to active drought resistance efforts in various places, most areas of the province had completed early rice sowing before the end of March.

Since the end of March and early April, continuous rainfall has occurred in various parts of Guangdong, basically relieving the drought. After the rain, farmers have intensified their spring plowing activities, storing water for emergency use, checking mountain ponds and water slopes, and planting early-maturing crops. In the Hainan District, 80% of the rice paddies have been transplanted with seedlings, and in the Yuexi District, 650,000 mu of peanuts have been planted.

    广东农民抓紧雨后播种插秧
    广东今年春旱比较严重，很多地区秧田缺水，无法播种。部分地区冬种作物又遭受冻害，开始呈现荒情。广东省各级党政机关为了预防和战胜灾荒，除增拨一批农贷和救济粮款，支持农民进行春耕和解决一部分农民生活困难外，并积极领导农民抗旱播种。中共高要县第四区委员会领导新江、沙田等十一个乡的农民，兴建拦河坝拦截新兴江河水，灌溉了三万多亩稻田。潮汕平原上的潮安、澄海、揭阳、饶平等县农民封锁韩江，引韩江水抗旱，解除了约八十万亩农田的春旱威胁。由于各地积极抗旱，在三月底以前，全省大部地区都已结束早稻播种。
    三月底四月初，广东各地已连续降雨，旱患基本解除，农民们在雨后都加紧春耕活动，纷纷储水抢种，检查山塘水坡，种植早熟作物。海南区百分之八十的秧田已插秧，粤西区已种下花生六十五万亩。
