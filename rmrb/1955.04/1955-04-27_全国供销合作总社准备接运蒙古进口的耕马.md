    The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives is preparing to transport 20,000 draught horses imported from the Mongolian People's Republic. Sixty-seven technical personnel who will inspect the horses in the Mongolian People's Republic departed for Ulaanbaatar before April 22nd. Entrusted by the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Supply and Marketing Cooperative has selected more than 160 experienced herders locally to prepare for receiving the horses at the border. In order to ensure that these draught horses can be quickly and properly supplied to farmers, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives recently convened a Mongolian Horse Management Conference in Hohhot to specifically arrange for transportation and organized sales. The conference also studied the issues of resolving farmers' funds for purchasing horses and training agricultural production cooperative breeders with relevant departments, and requested that supply and marketing cooperatives in various provinces reduce transportation costs as much as possible, so that the average transportation cost per horse could be reduced by 21% compared to last year.

    全国供销合作总社准备接运蒙古进口的耕马
    中华全国供销合作总社正在准备接运从蒙古人民共和国进口的二万匹耕马。到蒙古人民共和国验收马匹的六十七个技术人员已于四月二十二日前去乌兰巴托。内蒙古自治区供销合作社受全国供销合作总社的委托，已在当地挑选了一百六十多个牧马能手准备在国境接运。为了使这批耕马能够迅速妥善地供应到农民手中，全国供销合作总社最近在呼和浩特市召开了蒙马经营会议，具体安排了赶运和组织销售等工作。会议对于解决农民购马资金和训练农业生产合作社饲养员工作也和有关部门进行了研究，并要求各省供销合作社尽量降低调运费用，使每匹马的调运费用平均能比去年降低百分之二十一。　（新华社）
