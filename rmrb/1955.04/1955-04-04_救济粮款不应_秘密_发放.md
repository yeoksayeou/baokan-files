Relief Funds and Grain Should Not Be Distributed "Secretly"
    Ke Anting
    Lukou Township in Echeng County, Hubei Province, is a severely affected disaster area. Last winter, the People's Government allocated 16.48 million yuan (old currency, same below) in relief funds and 46,749 catties of relief grain (grain coupons) to the township.

    After the relief funds and grain coupons were distributed, the CCP Township Branch convened a branch committee meeting to study distribution methods. The branch committee members felt that the disaster situation in the township was severe, and in order to prevent anyone from starving to death, the relief funds and grain coupons should be tightly controlled to prevent the masses from quickly spending the relief funds and eating up the grain. The starting point of this idea was not bad, but they adopted wrong methods. They decided to distribute the relief funds "secretly" and not issue too many grain coupons, only enough for a few days at a time for each person. After the meeting, Party member cadres went to the villages to start the distribution work. Because the distribution was to be "secret," the cadres did not dare to hold meetings with the masses for discussion and assessment. They only relied on personal investigation and subjectively identified households as being in difficulty, and then quietly distributed some to them. As a result, the distribution was very unfair. Households that should have received less relief, such as the landlord element Li Huaxiang, received relief funds three times in a row, receiving more money than they should have. However, households that should have received relief, such as poor peasant Ou Kejin and six or seven others, did not receive any relief funds at all. Grain coupons were issued every three to five days. Fishing is the main sideline production in this township. Because grain coupons were issued every three to five days, fishermen did not dare to go far, and they could not catch fish nearby. Some people also did not dare to go to distant places to engage in sideline production such as chopping firewood. As a result, the income of many mutual aid teams, agricultural production cooperatives, and individual farmers was greatly reduced.

    Township cadres were busy issuing slips and writing certificates all day long in order to distribute relief funds and grain coupons, and could not participate in production. Everyone was very depressed, and some said, "I'm dizzy with noise every day, I can't do my job well, and people still complain. I don't know what's going on!"

    The CCP Echeng County Committee discovered this situation and pointed out that this practice was wrong. The Lukou Township Party Branch Committee members became alert and quickly convened a branch meeting to criticize the deviations in the past distribution work and study new distribution methods: convening a township People's Congress meeting to publicize the government's production and disaster relief policies, explaining who should receive relief and who should not, and determining the time and quantity of grain supply. The township People's Congress meeting discussed and formulated standards for long-term relief and temporary relief. At the same time, it was decided that long-term relief households would receive three months' worth of relief funds at one time, and temporary relief households would receive one month's worth of relief funds at one time; grain coupons would be issued for one month at a time. After the meeting, the township People's Representatives, according to the spirit of the meeting, went to the villages to convene mass meetings, on the one hand to publicize the government's production and disaster relief policies, and on the other hand to mobilize the masses to discuss the distribution methods. The masses believed that this distribution method was more reasonable than the previous one.

    The improvement of the distribution work greatly promoted the self-salvation through production of the disaster victims in the township. Agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and some individual farmers have all formulated production plans and savings plans. In the past, agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams could not assign work easily, but now as soon as it is assigned, people go. The Red Star First Cooperative needed twenty laborers to quarry stones at Daye Tieshan, and the members were all competing to go. They said, "The problem of family life has been solved, and we don't worry about production outside." People who did not dare to go far to fish in the past are now taking enough rations to fish in Huangshi City and other places. The Red Star First Cooperative has increased its daily fish catch from 30 catties to more than 100 catties. The income of the masses has greatly increased. The production income deposited by the three agricultural production cooperatives and fifteen mutual aid teams in the credit cooperative reached more than 5 million yuan.

### 救济粮款不应“秘密”发放

    救济粮款不应“秘密”发放
    柯安亭
    湖北省鄂城县路口乡是重灾乡。去年冬季，人民政府拨给这个乡救济款一千六百四十八万元（旧币，下同）和救济粮（粮票）四万六千七百四十九斤。
    救济款和粮票发下以后，中共乡支部召开了支委会议，研究发放的办法。支部委员们觉得：乡里灾情重，为了不致饿死一个人，应该把救济款和粮票扣得紧一些，免得群众很快把救济款花完，把粮食吃光。他们这种想法的出发点并不是坏的，但却采取了错误的作法。他们决定“秘密”发放救济款，而粮票也不要发多，每人每次只发几天的。散会以后，党员干部到各村开始发放工作。因为是要“秘密”发放，所以干部不敢让群众开会评议，仅凭个人去摸底，主观地认为是困难户的，就悄悄地发放一些。结果发放得很不公平。应该少救济的户如地主分子李华香，连续领了三次救济款，多领了钱。而应该救济的如贫农欧克金等六、七户，反而没有领到救济款。粮票是三、五天发一次。打鱼是这个乡副业生产的主要门路，由于三、五天发一次粮票，打鱼的人不敢远走，而附近又打不到鱼；有些人也不敢到远地搞砍柴等副业生产。这样，许多互助组、农业生产合作社和个体农民的收入就大大减少了。
    乡干部为了发放救济款和粮票，一天到晚忙着开条子，写证明条子，不能参加生产。大家都很苦闷，有的说：“每天吵晕了头，工作搞不好，还有人埋怨，不知道是怎么回事！”
    中共鄂城县委会发现了这种情况，指出这种做法是错误的。路口乡党支部委员都警惕起来，迅速召开了支部会议，批判了过去发放工作的偏差，研究了新的发放办法：召开乡人民代表大会会议，宣传政府的生产救灾政策，讲明哪些人应当救济，哪些人不应当救济，确定粮食供应的时间和数量。乡人民代表大会会议讨论并订出了长期救济和临时救济的标准，同时确定长期救济户一次发足三个月的救济款，临时救济户一次发足一个月的救济款；粮票一次发一个月的。会后，乡人民代表根据会议的精神，分头在各村召开了群众大会，一面宣传政府的生产救灾政策，一面发动群众讨论发放的办法。群众都认为这个发放办法比以前的合理。
    发放工作的改进，大大推动了全乡灾民的生产自救。农业生产合作社、互助组和一些单干农民都制定了生产计划和节约计划。农业生产合作社、互助组过去派工派不动，现在一派就去。红星第一社需要二十个劳动力到大冶铁山打石子，社员都争着去。他们说：“家里生活问题解决了，在外生产也不挂心。”原来打鱼不敢走远的人，现在都带足口粮到黄石市等地打鱼。红星第一社由每天打鱼三十斤提高到一百多斤。群众的收入大大增加了。三个农业生产合作社和十五个互助组存入信用合作社的生产收入款达五百多万元。
