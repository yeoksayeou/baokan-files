The people of Sichuan Province are actively providing useful resource clues for petroleum exploration work. From January 1954 to February of this year, the Southwest Petroleum Geological Survey Office received a total of 148 letters from the public reporting mineral discoveries, of which 121 contained information on petroleum and natural gas resources. After mineral specimen testing and field investigations, it has been proven that most of them do indeed have traces of petroleum and natural gas, which can be used for further exploration in the future.

People in various places are very enthusiastic about reporting mineral discoveries. Huang Xiaozhong, a farmer in a certain area of eastern Sichuan, spent half a month of his spare time to understand the topography of the mineral deposit area in order to clarify the terrain, and made a topographical sketch map for the Southwest Petroleum Geological Survey Office. The Southwest Petroleum Geological Survey Office also received many letters reporting mineral discoveries from elementary school students. Some elementary schools have established "Natural Science Groups" or "Mineral Groups" to learn the skills of finding underground resources for the country's industrialization. Elementary school students from the "Natural Science Group" of a school in Shehong County went to a gully on a holiday and found some pyrite. The 304th Gravity Exploration Team of the Southwest Petroleum Geological Survey Office, led by a shepherd boy, took oil samples at a place called Petroleum Beach.

    四川人民群众积极报矿
    四川省人民群众积极为石油勘探工作提供有用的资源线索。从一九五四年一月到今年二月，西南石油地质处收到的群众报矿信共有一百四十八件，其中有关石油和天然气矿产的资料有一百二十一件。经过矿苗试验和实地调查，证明其中大部分都确实有石油和天然气苗存在，可供今后进一步勘探。
    各地群众对报矿工作都很热情。川东某地农民黄孝忠，为了弄清矿藏地区的地形，利用休息时间，前后作了半个月的地形了解工作，作出了一张地形草图给西南石油地质处。西南石油地质处还收到许多小学生的报矿信。有些小学校成立了“自然科学小组”或“矿物小组”，学习为祖国工业化找寻地下资源的本领。射洪县某校的“自然科学小组”的小学生们，在一个休假天到一条山沟去，就找到一些黄铁矿。西南石油地质处三零四重力探勘队，曾在一位牧童带领下，在一个叫石油滩的地方取到了油苗。
