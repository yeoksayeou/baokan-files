    The Recovered Losses
  　Jin Yukun
    The Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee decided to build a large office building capable of accommodating 600 people this year. In the initial design, considering that this was the highest administrative organ in the province, it should be built impressively, so more attention was paid to the shape and decoration, and less consideration was given to the economy and applicability of the building. At the beginning of this year, the Provincial People's Committee, based on the principle of "economy, applicability, and attention to aesthetics where possible" in construction, inspected and discussed the design of this building three times in the Governor's Office meeting, and the General Office convened relevant departments and designers to repeatedly discuss and study, modifying the extravagant and inapplicable parts of the original design.
    In the process of revising the design, what problems were discovered, and what modifications were made?
    In order to make the building's lines "symmetrical and beautiful," the original design included a clock tower-like structure on top of the building. A long and sharp red spire was to extend from this, and a dazzling golden five-pointed star was to be placed at the top of the spire. Including the appurtenances, the spire was 18 meters high, increasing the height of the building by nearly half. When revising the design, everyone felt that this spire was a completely unnecessary decoration and would cost a lot of money, so this part was cut. To match the spire, the original design added a "sixth floor," which had only one room, of little practical value, but would cost a lot of money, so after the spire was cancelled, this sixth floor was also cancelled.
    In order to make the facade of the building imposing and complement the spire, the original design included a "porte-cochère" in front of the main entrance, two stories high, supported by six columns. The "porte-cochère" protruded five meters forward, and cars could drive up to the steps from both sides. Corresponding to the main "porte-cochère," there were two more "porte-cochères" on both sides, supported by four columns. When revising the design, everyone thought that the porte-cochère could be changed to one story high, and the six columns could be changed to four columns; at the same time, it was considered that there was not much difference between cars driving to the steps and driving to the entrance, and the protruding part could be retracted to align with the entire building, which would save a lot of construction costs. The porte-cochères on both sides could be eliminated altogether.
    In the original design, immediately after entering the main entrance, there was a two-story-high hall with an area of 270 square meters, plus the area occupied by the upper floor, nearly 400 square meters. In fact, a one-story-high hall of 110 square meters would have been sufficient. This would save two-thirds of the area for use as offices.
    The original design also stipulated that there would be a cloakroom on each floor. Now it is changed to adding a coat rack in each office, so six cloakrooms can be turned into six offices. Six large sun decks can also be turned into offices. These two items alone can increase the office area by about 200 square meters.
    In addition to reducing unnecessary decorations and increasing the effective usable area, the revised design also repeatedly considered how to use economical local materials as much as possible to reduce construction costs. In order to make the exterior magnificent, the original design used a large amount of granite, even for the foundation. Now it has been decided to use bluestone for the entire foundation, which is one-third cheaper than granite, and all the granite used for external decoration has been cancelled. In addition, the use of particleboard, which is both cheap and saves wood, and lightweight bricks, which can reduce the foundation load, is maximized, and white ash is used instead of cement, all of which can greatly reduce the construction cost of the building.
    The Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee's timely inspection and modification of the extravagant and wasteful phenomena in the design of the office building is a very meaningful thing. They only slightly modified the original design, which increased the usable area of the building by 427 square meters, an increase of about 8% over the effective usable area of the original design. The construction cost per square meter was reduced by 2.9%, and the total investment was reduced by more than 135,000 yuan. Construction is also simpler. If all construction units and design units can follow the principle of "economy, applicability, and attention to aesthetics where possible" to check those projects that are about to be constructed or are under construction, and timely stop the extravagant and wasteful phenomena in the original design, they will be able to recover many undue losses for the country.

    被挽回了的损失
  　金雨困
    黑龙江省人民委员会决定今年建筑一座能容六百人办公的大楼。在初设计时，由于考虑到这是全省最高的行政机关，应该修得像样些，因而注意造型和装饰就多了些，对建筑物的经济和适用就考虑得少了些。今年年初省人民委员会根据建筑的“经济、适用、在可能条件下注意美观”的原则先后三次在省长办公会议上，检查和讨论了这个大楼的设计，并由办公厅召集有关部门和设计人员反复讨论研究，修改了原设计中铺张浪费和不适用的部分。
    在修改设计的过程中，发现了些什么问题，作了那些修改呢？
    为了使建筑物线条“对称美观”，原设计在建筑物顶端要修一个钟楼样的东西。在这上边还要伸出一个又长又尖的红色尖塔，尖塔的顶峰又安着一颗光彩夺目的金色五角星。连同附属物在内，尖塔共有十八公尺高，使建筑物的高度增加了将近一倍。在修改设计时，大家认为这个尖塔完全是不必要的装饰，而且要多花许多钱，就把这个部分削减了。为了陪衬尖塔，原设计加了个第“六层楼”，这六层楼上只有一个房间，使用价值不大，钱可要花不少，取消尖塔后，也把这第六层楼取消了。
    为使建筑物立面的气势雄伟并和尖塔相陪衬，原设计在正门前修了一个有两层楼高，用六根柱子支着的“门罩”，“门罩”向前凸出五公尺，汽车可从两侧开到台阶上来。同正“门罩”相衬，两侧还有两个用四根柱子支着的“门罩”。在修改设计时，大家认为门罩完全可以改为一层楼高，六根柱子可改为四根柱子；同时又考虑汽车开到台阶和开到门口并无多大区别，凸出的部分可以让它缩回去，同整个建筑物拉齐，这样就可减省许多建筑费用。两侧的门罩根本可以不要。
    原设计上一进大门，就是一个两层楼高方圆二百七十平方公尺的大厅，加上上层所占用的面积约近四百平方公尺。实际上有一个一层楼高，一百一十平方公尺的大厅已经够用。这样就可节约三分之二的面积来作办公室用。
    原来设计还规定每层楼都有一个挂衣室。现在改为每个办公室里多添一个衣架，这样六个挂衣室就可变为六个办公室。还有六个很大的晒台也同样可以改为办公室。仅这两项就可增加办公室的面积约二百平方公尺。
    除了减少不必要的装饰和增加有效使用面积外，在修改设计时还反复考虑了如何尽可能采用经济的地方材料，来降低造价。原设计为了使外形雄壮，大量采用花岗石，甚至基础也要用花岗石。现在决定基础全部改用青石，可比花岗石便宜三分之一，外部装饰用的花岗石全部取消。此外尽可能地多采用既便宜又节约木材的刨花板和可减轻基础负担的轻型砖，并用白灰代替水泥，这些都可以大大降低建筑物的造价。
    黑龙江省人民委员会及时检查和修改办公大楼设计上的铺张浪费现象，是很有意义的事情。他们只是稍为改动了一下原来的设计，就使这个大楼增加了四百二十七平方公尺的使用面积，较原设计的有效使用面积增加了百分之八左右。每平方公尺的建筑造价降低了百分之二点九，总共可减少投资十三万五千余元。施工也简单了。如果所有的建设单位、设计单位都能按照“经济、适用、在可能条件下注意美观”的原则来检查一下那些即将施工或正在施工项目，及时制止原设计中铺张浪费的现象，就能为国家挽回许多不应有的损失。
