Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 28th. Negotiations for a new Sino-Japanese trade agreement have not yet reached an agreement on important measures related to the development of Sino-Japanese trade. These issues include payment issues and the mutual establishment of trade representative offices. The fundamental reason for the failure to reach a final agreement lies in the attitude of the Japanese government and the consequent impact on the Japanese negotiators, who have failed to offer constructive opinions on the positive and realistic proposals put forward by the Chinese trade delegation visiting Japan.
  Regarding the payment issue, the Chinese delegation proposed at the beginning of the negotiations that the national banks of both sides conclude a payment agreement. The Japanese representatives believed that such an agreement was necessary, but stated that it was not possible at present because China and Japan had not yet established diplomatic relations. Subsequently, the Japanese side suggested that the Bank of Tokyo and the Bank of China conclude a payment agreement. However, the Japanese side withdrew the original proposal the next day, saying that this type of payment agreement must be approved by the United States and cannot include so-called "embargoed" materials. Then, the Japanese side proposed a plan for the national banks of the two countries to conclude a payment agreement settled in Japanese yen. In order to reach an agreement as soon as possible, the Chinese delegation was willing to make concessions, stating that in principle, it agreed to negotiate based on the Japanese proposal. However, at this time, the Japanese side said that the Bank of Japan could not directly come forward for negotiations. Due to these changes on the Japanese side, negotiations on the payment issue, which plays an important role in the smooth development of trade, have not made any progress to date.
    Regarding the issue of the mutual establishment of trade representative offices, the Chinese delegation suggested that the trade representative offices should be powerful, effective, and able to resolve various trade-related issues. The governments of both sides must guarantee that the members of this agency have all the conveniences and security for carrying out their work and freedom of communication. The Japanese side suggested that the trade representative office on the Japanese side should be sent by the Japan International Trade Promotion Association. Therefore, this important issue related to the development of normal trade has not been agreed upon.
    It is reported that the performance of the Japanese representatives in the negotiations is inseparable from the attitude of the Japanese government. The Japanese government clearly stated during the general election that it would implement an independent and autonomous foreign policy, improve Sino-Japanese relations, and develop Sino-Japanese trade. However, when it came to the test of this Sino-Japanese trade agreement negotiation, it did not really move forward. In recent days, people from all walks of life in Japan have successively raised questions to the government and launched petitions, demanding that the government fulfill its election promises, adopt a positive attitude towards the negotiations of this Sino-Japanese trade agreement, and assume the responsibilities that the government should bear.

### 由于日本政府避不承担应负的责任  中日贸易谈判至今尚未达成最后协议

    由于日本政府避不承担应负的责任
    中日贸易谈判至今尚未达成最后协议
    新华社东京二十八日电　新的中日贸易协议的谈判在关系发展中日贸易的重要措施问题上，直到现在还没有取得协议。这些问题包括支付问题和互设贸易代表机构问题。谈判不能达成最后协议的基本原因在于日本政府的态度以及因此影响日方谈判代表未能对中国访问日本贸易代表团方面的积极的、实事求是的建议提出建设性的意见。
  　关于支付问题，中国代表团方面在谈判一开始就提出由双方国家银行缔结支付协定。日方代表认为这样的协定是必要的，但又表示现在由于中日两国还没有建立邦交，不可能这样做。随后，日方建议由东京银行和中国银行缔结支付协定。然而，隔天日方又撤回了原案，说这种支付协定必须得到美国的许可，而且不能包括有所谓“禁运”物资。接着，日方提出了由两国国家银行缔结以日元结汇的支付协定的方案。中国代表团为了早日达成协议，愿意让步，表示在原则上同意可根据日方提案进行协商。但是，这时日方又说日本银行现在不能直接出面商谈。由于日方这些变化，使对顺利开展贸易具有重要作用的支付问题的谈判，迄今没有进展。
    关于双方互设贸易代表机构问题，中国代表团建议贸易代表机构应该是有权力、有效能并且能够解决有关贸易的各项问题的机构，双方政府必须保证这一机构的成员有进行工作的一切便利和安全以及通信自由。日方则建议贸易代表机构在日本方面由日本国际贸易促进协会派出。因此，这个关系发展正常贸易的重要问题也没有能够得到协议。
    据悉，日方代表在谈判中的表现是和日本政府的态度分不开的。日本政府在大选时曾明确表示要执行独立自主的外交政策，改进中日关系和发展中日贸易。但临到这次中日贸易协议谈判的考验时，却并没有真正向前移动脚步。日本各界人士近几天来纷纷向政府提出质询，发起请愿，要求政府实现大选诺言，对这次中日贸易协议的谈判采取积极的态度，承担起政府应负的责任。
