    Starting from Bandung
    By Our Correspondent Wu Wentao
    Regardless of the sudden downpours at dusk, the crowds standing on both sides of Asia-Africa Street remained steadfastly waiting for news from Independence Building. The news finally arrived: the Asian-African Conference had unanimously reached an agreement and successfully concluded. In the gentle evening breeze, the clouds gradually dispersed. Bandung was celebrating the achievements of this historically significant week.
    The convening of the Asian-African Conference was indeed a very important event. These twenty-nine countries – possessing over thirty-one million square kilometers of area, with a population of fourteen hundred million, stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from temperate to tropical and equatorial regions, with such different social systems and ideologies, such different clothing, such different languages, representing the world's most ancient and greatest cultures and traditions..., for so many years trampled underfoot by colonialists, and now, representatives of this region were sitting together to discuss matters of common concern, beginning to write their own history with their own hands. This naturally displeased the colonialists, especially the ubiquitous American colonialists.
    Before arriving in Bandung, I had read about the American government's condemnation of the Asian-African Conference and the steps they were preparing to take to deal with it. After arriving in Bandung, I heard from more honest American journalists about the various scandals of those who, under the guise of news reporters, received subsidies from the State Department to engage in sabotage: from spreading pessimistic sentiments to directing so-called "Turkestan" and "Kalmyk" petition groups, it was truly a mixed bag. At the same time, as Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo said in his closing speech on the 24th: When we met at the first meeting on April 18, many of us did not know each other... There was suspicion at that time. Can we really – surely more than one of us asked ourselves this – achieve our goals and make a real contribution to promoting world peace and cooperation? Are our goals not too high? Wouldn't the political, social and cultural differences between countries be an insurmountable obstacle to this contribution, even to effective discussion?
    Unsurprisingly, among the twenty-nine participating countries, opinions differed. Although most Asian and African countries have shared a common destiny for many years, under the imperialist policy of "divide and rule," it was difficult to avoid suspicion and estrangement between them. However, after seven days of discussion, people found a basis for agreement from the divergence of opinions; under the premise of seeking common ground while reserving differences, various agreements were finally reached. By the afternoon of the 24th, the Political Committee finally adopted the "Declaration on the Promotion of World Peace and Cooperation," and the Asian-African Conference completed its most important task.
    On the afternoon of April 24, the press box in the Independence Building auditorium was crowded very early. It was not until the evening that this final meeting began. The Secretary-General of the conference first read out over forty congratulatory messages sent from all corners of the world, and then read out resolutions on economic cooperation, cultural cooperation, human rights and self-determination, the issue of people in dependent territories, and the promotion of world peace and cooperation. When the chairman asked, "Does anyone object to these resolutions?" applause erupted throughout the venue, very enthusiastically. The Indonesian "National Herald" newspaper commented on this achievement on April 25, saying: "Premier Zhou Enlai's demonstrated hope for friendship and avoidance of unpleasant arguments contributed significantly to this historically significant meeting." The newspaper pointed out: All indications show that someone attempted to set traps in order to make the conference end in unpleasant disputes, but failed. During the closing session, when many representatives spoke, I noticed that Prime Minister Nehru, Prime Minister U Nu... were clearly happy with the conference's achievement of unanimous agreement. I found the Syrian representative's speech very moving. He said that in the United Nations, he rarely saw unanimous opinions, and that the unanimous adoption of resolutions by this Asian-African Conference showed the firm will of the Asian and African people to oppose colonialism and demand peace and cooperation.
    Commentators here pointed out that the ten principles in the Declaration on the Promotion of World Peace and Cooperation are essentially consistent with the Five Principles in the joint statement of the Chinese and Indian, Chinese and Burmese prime ministers.
    Now, the representatives of the countries attending the conference are preparing their luggage to bid farewell to Bandung. General public opinion believes that the achievements of the Bandung Conference are definite. Premier Zhou's speech at the closing session has already made a correct assessment of the conference's achievements.
    The American imperialists did not like the convening of the Asian-African Conference, but the Asian-African Conference was successfully convened and concluded. The American imperialists wanted to isolate the People's Republic of China at the conference, but the delegation of the People's Republic of China, from beginning to end, based on the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences, worked hard to strive for the success of the conference with a frank and upright position, winning the welcome and praise of public opinion. Facts have proved that it is not others who are isolated and attacked, but the colonialists who are afraid of the Asian-African Conference achieving something.
    In the communiqué, the Bandung Conference suggested considering holding the next Asian-African Conference, which is welcome. People are looking forward to: starting from Bandung, the friendly cooperation between Asian and African countries and people will develop day by day.
    April 25, Bandung

### 从万隆开始

    从万隆开始
    本报记者　吴文焘
    不管黄昏时的阵阵急雨，亚非大街两旁伫立的群众屹立不动地等待着独立大厦的消息。这个消息终于来到了：亚非会议一致达成协议、胜利闭幕了。在晚风徐来中，云雾渐渐散去了。万隆在庆祝这有历史意义的一周的成就。
    亚非会议的召开的确是一件十分重大的事情。这二十九个国家——占有三千一百多万平方公里的面积，有着十四亿人口，从大西洋到太平洋，从温带到热带和赤道地区，有着那样不同的社会制度和思想意识，那样不同的服装，那样不同的语言，代表着世界上那些最古老伟大的文化和传统……，多少年来处在殖民主义者践踏下，而今，这个地区的代表们坐在一起讨论共同有关的问题，开始来用自己的手写作自己的历史，这自然是殖民主义者、特别是无孔不入的美国殖民主义者所不高兴的。
    在没有到万隆以前，我就读到美国官方诅咒亚非会议，和准备对付亚非会议的步骤。来到万隆以后，我又听到比较正直的美国记者诉说那些假借新闻工作者名义、从国务院领了津贴来专事破坏工作的人们的种种丑事：从散布悲观气氛到导演所谓
  “土耳其斯坦”和“卡尔木克”请愿团，真是五花八门，不一而足。同时，正像印度尼西亚沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理在二十四日闭幕词中所说的：当四月十八日我们在第一次大会上见面时，我们中间很多人还是彼此不相识的……当时还有怀疑。我们真能——我们之中必定是不只一人地这样问自己——达到我们的目标，对于促进世界和平和合作上作出真正的贡献吗？我们的目标不是太高吗？各国在政治、社会和文化观上的如此不同，不会是对于这种贡献、甚至进行有效的讨论的一种不可越过的障碍吗？
    用不着奇怪，在二十九个与会国家中，意见是会有所不同的。尽管大多数亚非国家多年来有着共同的命运，但在帝国主义“分而治之”的政策下，就难免彼此间有了怀疑和隔膜。可是，经过七天的讨论，人们由意见的不一致中找寻出一致的基础；在求同存异的前提下，终于达成了各种协议。到了二十四日的下午，政治委员会最后通过了“关于促进世界和平和合作的宣言”，亚非会议就完成了它的最重要的一项工作。
    四月二十四日的下午，独立大厦会场的记者席上很早就挤满了人。直到傍晚这最后的一次会议才开始了。大会秘书长首先宣读了上四十个从全世界各个角落拍来的贺电，接着就宣读关于经济合作、文化合作、人权和自决、附属国人民问题和促进世界和平和合作等决议。当主席提出：“有没有人反对这些决议？”的问题时，全场掌声四起，十分热烈。四月二十五日的印度尼西亚“民族使者”报评论这个成就时说：“周恩来总理所表现的希望友好、和避免不愉快的争论，对于这次历史意义的会议贡献不小。”该报指出：种种迹象表明：有人企图布置圈套以便使会议争论得不欢而散，结果却失败了。在闭幕会上许多代表讲话时，我注意到尼赫鲁总理、吴努总理……显然对会议的达到一致协议表示高兴。我觉得叙利亚代表的发言是很动人的。他说在联合国，他很少看到过全体一致的意见，而这次亚非会议的全体一致通过决议，表示亚非人民反对殖民主义和要求和平与合作的坚定意志。
    这里的评论家们指出：在关于促进世界和平和合作宣言里的十条原则，实质上和中印、中缅总理联合声明中的五项原则相一致。
    现在，出席会议的各国代表们正在准备行装要向万隆告别了。一般的舆论都认为万隆会议的成就是肯定的。周总理在闭幕会上的发言，已经对会议的成就作了正确的估计。
    美帝国主义者不喜欢亚非会议的召开，但亚非会议顺利地召开并结束了。美帝国主义者想在会议里孤立中华人民共和国，而中华人民共和国代表团自始至终本着求同存异的精神努力争取会议成功的光明磊落的立场，博得了舆论界的欢迎和赞扬。事实证明，被孤立和受到打击的不是别人，正是害怕亚非会议有所成就的殖民主义者。
    在公报里，万隆会议建议考虑召开下一次亚非会议，这是值得欢迎的。人民正期待着：从万隆开始，亚非国家和人民之间的友好合作将日益发展起来。    四月二十五日于万隆
