The Essence of U.S. "Aid" to Asian Countries
Feng Zhidan

Recently, while intensifying the creation of tension and preparing for war, the United States has been vigorously publicizing its "aid" to Asian countries, trying to make people believe that the United States wants to "assist Asian countries in industrialization" and "raise the living standards of the Asian people." Harold Stassen, Director of the U.S. Foreign Operations Administration, after participating in the Bangkok conference, which was a conspiracy to expand aggression, went to various countries in the Far East to peddle U.S. "aid," and even claimed that he would formulate a "new aid plan extending from South Korea all the way to Afghanistan." News has it that the U.S. President has specifically chosen to formally submit a large-scale "aid plan" to Congress on April 15th – three days before the opening of the Asian-African Conference.

The U.S. government's choice to particularly exaggerate its "aid" plan to Asia at this time is for a reason. The rising movement of the Asian people against the U.S. policy of war and colonialism in Asia is making it increasingly difficult for Washington to implement this policy, and the prospect of the upcoming Asian-African Conference is making it even more uneasy. The United States wants to try to ease the opposition to it and undermine this historic conference of the Asian and African peoples.

However, this is not the first time that people all over the world have heard such hypocritical tones from Washington. Everyone can see that what U.S. "aid" brings to economically backward countries is by no means "industrialization" and "improved living standards," but rather enslavement and disaster. The essence of U.S. "aid" to Asian countries is for rampant military aggression, insatiable economic plunder, and ambitious colonial expansion. The U.S. President, in his report to Congress on the issue of "mutual security assistance" on March 14 this year, emphasized this view of the Washington ruling group, saying, "Backward countries possess most of the world's population, occupy the largest part of the world's land, are the main source of the world's critical minerals and raw materials, and have many of the world's most valuable bases."

The National Foreign Trade Council of the United States, one of the organizations of U.S. monopoly capital, emphasized in the "Final Declaration" adopted at its November conference last year: "In the case of backward countries, aid should be based primarily on military and strategic considerations." The record of U.S. "aid" in the past few years shows that "military aid," which is openly aimed at planning wars, has consistently accounted for the vast majority of U.S. "aid" appropriations to the Far East Pacific region.

Recently, with the intensification of U.S. aggressive activities in Asia, the nature of U.S. "aid" is becoming increasingly clear. U.S. columnist Alan pointed out that one of the important features of the 1956 U.S. "aid" plan is that the funds for "training combat troops of friendly countries – mainly those in the Far East" will be doubled compared to 1955. Alan revealed, "Under this expanded plan, the United States intends to train an estimated 1.25 million troops of various types in South Vietnam, Thailand, Pakistan, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea." The important implication of so-called U.S. "aid" is the concrete manifestation of the U.S. aggressive group's heinous policy of "Asians fighting Asians," which is obvious.

U.S. monopoly capitalists are particularly "concerned" about Asia because, in their view, Asia's "backward regions" can provide them with cheap cannon fodder for aggressive wars and forward bases close to peaceful and democratic countries. Moreover, through so-called "military aid," the United States can establish and strengthen its military control over the recipient countries, and a step further from this control is complete colonial rule over these countries. Indian Prime Minister Nehru, in commenting on this "aid" from the United States, vividly depicted its implications for Asian countries, saying: "When I think of...military aid, the past history of Asia comes to my mind; the history of the last three or four hundred years, the history of colonial rule, gradually entering and staying here. ...It reminds me of the situation of foreign troops coming to Asia."

In fact, not only is U.S. "military aid" for the purpose of such military aggression, but the so-called "economic aid" that the United States has been particularly promoting recently is also for the same purpose. Hoffman, the former implementer of the "Marshall Plan," once admitted: "Under the current circumstances, military aid and economic aid are basically the same." Former U.S. President Truman once said it even more clearly. In his report on the implementation of U.S. "aid" in the first half of 1952, he admitted that the purpose of U.S. economic and technical "aid" to Asian countries was to "strengthen the military and police components."

Of course, U.S. "aid" is not limited to military and strategic considerations, but also has political and economic roles serving the interests of colonial expansion. The U.S. ruling group regards U.S. "aid" as a tool to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Byroade once frankly told Congress: Increasing "aid" to Asia "will definitely give us more say in solving the political problems in this region." The U.S.'s so-called "Battle Act" is a shameless piece of legislation that openly uses "aid" as a means to interfere in other countries' trade policies.

As for the purpose of economic plunder contained in U.S. "aid," it is even more self-evident. In this regard, U.S. monopoly capital groups are mainly focused on markets, raw material supply, and sources of excess profits. In recent years, through "aid," the United States has significantly increased its plunder of raw materials, especially strategic resources, from some Asian countries. The "Economic and Technical Assistance Agreements" signed between the United States and the Philippines, Thailand, and other countries explicitly stipulate that these countries must indefinitely transport strategic raw materials to the United States. The "New York Times" pointed out as early as 1947 that the United States' "strong concern for the Middle East" was due to the rich oil resources in that region. With U.S. "aid," more and more oil rights have fallen into the hands of U.S. oil monopoly groups. Before the war, U.S. monopoly capital controlled about 12 percent of the annual oil production in the Middle East, while by 1953 the United States controlled nearly 60 percent of the Middle East's oil production.

Through "aid," U.S. capital has accelerated its penetration and expansion in Asia and Africa, squeezed out the forces of other colonial countries such as Britain and France in many countries, and extracted astonishing excess profits. Today, the increasing emphasis of the U.S. government's "aid" to Asia plan on capital export reveals its true meaning. According to statistics, in 1953, the average profit of U.S. foreign investment was 13.6 percent, while in the "backward regions" of Asia and Africa it was 25.6 percent, with individual countries even reaching 30 percent. The hypocrisy of Stassen and his ilk's bragging about helping Asian countries "industrialize" is imaginable. Indian international affairs expert Dhawan once thoroughly refuted this hypocritical slogan of the United States about "assisting" Asian countries in "industrialization," saying: "Helping 'friendly' countries industrialize and change their economic face is not the task of the United States... If that were the case, the countries of Latin America would have long become major industrial powers. ...In Asia, the main purpose of the U.S. government is to be able to use the vast manpower of Asia when fighting against Communist China. It is not interested in turning Asian countries into industrial countries." The following figures can also illustrate the economic plunder significance of U.S. "aid." According to statistics published by the U.S. Department of Commerce in "Current Business" (November 1954 issue), in 1953, in the total amount of U.S. "direct investment" in Asia and Africa, investment in raw material production accounted for more than 89 percent, while manufacturing accounted for only 3 percent. Even this 3 percent of U.S. capital is by no means used to develop independent manufacturing industries in these countries. The fact that U.S. automobile companies refused to build automobile manufacturing plants in India and would rather close the automobile assembly plants they had already opened is something that everyone knows.

U.S. monopoly capital groups also regard economically backward Asian countries as objects of crisis export and markets for dumping surplus commodities. This is largely accomplished through the form of "aid." The large amount of surplus munitions in the hands of U.S. arms dealers is one of the factors behind the U.S. government's enthusiasm for providing so-called "military aid." Everyone also knows that the dumping of surplus commodities and agricultural products by the United States to Asia is an important part of U.S. "economic aid" to Asian countries. As the crisis of U.S. agricultural product surpluses becomes more and more serious, the U.S. President has particularly emphasized a "broad surplus disposal plan" in his recent report on the "foreign aid" plan. This "plan" is essentially to dump large quantities of surplus agricultural products into the markets of recipient countries at prices higher than the world market. Even under the item of "economic aid," the United States has sold tens of thousands of tons of inferior or even rotten surplus wheat and cotton to India, Japan, and other recipient countries.

Since the nature of U.S. "aid" is like this, it is naturally impossible for it to have a beneficial impact on the economy of the recipient country. In fact, people see that those Asian countries that have received large amounts of U.S. "aid" not only cannot talk about industrialization at all, but their national economies have been severely damaged. Take the Philippines as an example. The Philippines' military budget in 1955 doubled compared to 1953. The massive dumping of U.S. commodities suffocated the Philippines' national industry. Four million people are unemployed in the Philippines, accounting for one-fifth of the total population. The former Acting Minister of Labor of the Philippine government, Quitoriano, also admitted: "Proportionally to the population, the Philippines may be the country with the most unemployment in the world." He also said: "The standard of living in the Philippines today is lower than it was twenty years ago." Therefore, the conclusion drawn by the "Pakistan Times" in commenting on the U.S.-Pakistan "aid" agreement is undoubtedly correct and pertinent. The newspaper wrote that the U.S. "aid" agreement "foreshadows a colonial form of economy, the essence of which is that the agriculture, industry, transportation, and communications of backward countries are developed to meet the needs of the suzerain state."

Many Asian countries, in order to promote the independent development of their own economies and to get rid of the economic backwardness caused by centuries of colonial rule, hope to obtain sincere foreign aid. For many years, industrialization has been the ideal dream of the people and many patriotic politicians in these countries. At various United Nations conferences discussing the economic problems of backward countries, representatives of many Asian countries have requested that foreign technical assistance be in line with the needs of these countries for industrialization, requested unconditional low-interest loans, requested normal international trade relations and economic cooperation, etc., but the representatives of Washington are not at all interested in any of these. What Washington is interested in is giving "aid" to economically backward countries under obvious military and political conditions, and under the condition that the recipient countries give up economic rights to ensure that U.S. monopoly capital obtains maximum profits. This imperialist nature of U.S. "aid" to Asia can only hinder the normal economic development of the recipient countries, and therefore cannot but arouse the doubts and dissatisfaction of all governments that cherish their own independence and sovereignty, and be strongly opposed by the people of all countries. The Asian people deeply understand that if they want to put their countries' economies on the path of independent development, they must not rely on imperialist "aid," but should rely on self-reliance and develop international economic cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The fact today is that as long as the people and governments of all countries work together, the real conditions for establishing and developing this normal international economic cooperation relationship are fully present.

    美国对亚洲国家“援助”的实质
    冯之丹
    最近时期，美国在加紧制造紧张局势、准备战争的同时，大事宣扬它对亚洲国家的“援助”，力图使人相信，美国是要“协助亚洲国家工业化”和
  “提高亚洲人民的生活水平”。美国援外管理署署长史塔生在参加了阴谋扩大侵略的曼谷会议以后就到远东各国活动，兜售美“援”货色，并扬言要拟订一项“从南朝鲜一直伸展到阿富汗”的“新的援助计划”。有消息说，美国总统还特地选定在四月十五日——亚非会议开幕前三天——正式向国会提出一个大规模的“援助计划”。
    美国政府选择现在这个时机特别大吹大擂它对亚洲的“援助”计划，是有缘故的。亚洲人民反对美国在亚洲推行战争和殖民政策的运动日益高涨，使华盛顿在亚洲推行这种政策愈来愈困难，即将举行的亚非会议的前景更使它坐立不安。美国想设法缓和一下对它的反对情绪，并破坏亚非人民这个历史性会议。
    但是，全世界人民听到华盛顿的这种伪善的声调已经不是第一次了。大家都看得到，美“援”所加之于经济落后国家的决不是什么“工业化”和“提高生活”，而是奴役和灾难。美国对亚洲国家进行
  “援助”的实质是为了狂妄的军事侵略、贪得无厌的经济掠夺和野心勃勃的殖民扩张。美国总统在他今年三月十四日就“共同安全援助”问题向国会提出的报告中，就强调了华盛顿统治集团的这种观点，他说，“落后国家拥有世界人口的大部分，占着世界陆地的最大部分，是世界上关键性矿产和原料的主要来源，并有着许多世界上最有价值的基地。”
    美国垄断资本的组织之一，美国全国对外贸易协会去年十一月大会通过的“最后宣言”强调：
  “就落后国家的情形来说，援助应主要是根据军事和战略上的考虑。”过去几年的美“援”记录表明，公开以策划战争为目的的“军事援助”一贯地占美国对远东太平洋地区的美“援”拨款中的绝大部分。
    近来，随着美国在亚洲侵略活动的加紧，美国
  “援助”的这种性质，正变得愈来愈鲜明了。美国专栏作家艾伦指出，一九五六年度美“援”计划的重要特征之一就是“训练友好国家——主要是远东的国家——的作战部队”的款项比一九五五年度还要增加一倍。艾伦透露，“根据这项扩大了的计划，美国打算在南越、泰国、巴基斯坦、日本、台湾和南朝鲜训练估计为一百二十五万人的各种类型的部队。”所谓美“援”的重要含意，就是美国侵略集团以“亚洲人打亚洲人”的罪恶政策的具体化，这是昭然若揭的。
    美国垄断资本家特别“关心”亚洲，是因为，在他们看来，亚洲“落后地区”能够为他们提供便宜的侵略战争炮灰和接近和平民主国家的前进基地。而且，通过所谓“军事援助”，美国便能建立和加强对受“援”国的军事上的控制，从这种控制跨进一步便是对这些国家的完全的殖民统治。印度总理尼赫鲁在评论美国的这种“援助”时，曾经生动地描画了它对于亚洲国家所包含的意义，他说：“在我想到……军事援助时，亚洲的过去历史就浮现在我的脑中；近三四百年的历史，殖民地统治的历史，逐渐地进到并停留在这里了。……使我回想起外国军队来到亚洲的情况。”
    实际上，不仅美国的“军事援助”为着这种军事侵略的目的，美国近来特别宣扬的所谓“经济援助”，也是为了同样的目的。前“马歇尔计划”的执行人霍夫曼就曾承认：“在目前情形下，军事援助和经济援助在基本上是一样的。”美国前总统杜鲁门曾经说得更为清楚。他在关于一九五二年上半年美
  “援”执行情况报告中承认，美国对亚洲国家的经济和技术“援助”，其目的就是“加强军事和警察的成分”。
    当然，美国的“援助”并不仅仅限于军事战略上的考虑，而且也有它服务于殖民扩张利益的政治和经济上的作用。美国统治集团把美“援”当作干涉别国内政的工具。美国助理国务卿拜罗德就曾直率地告诉过国会：增加对亚洲的“援助”，“定将使我们得到解决这一地区政治问题方面更多的发言权”。美国的所谓“巴特尔法案”就是公开以“援助”为手段，干涉别国贸易政策的无耻立法。
    至于美国“援助”所包含的经济掠夺的目的，那是更加不言而喻的。在这方面，美国垄断资本集团主要是着眼于市场、原料供应和超额利润的源泉。近几年来美国通过“援助”，对某些亚洲国家的原料，尤其是战略资源的掠夺有了显著的增加。美国同菲律宾、泰国等签订的“经济技术援助协定”就明文规定这些国家必须把战略原料无限止地输往美国。“纽约时报”早在一九四七年就曾指出过，美国“强烈关怀中东”，就是因为那个地区有着丰富的石油资源。随着美国的“援助”，愈来愈多的石油权益落入了美国石油垄断集团的手中。在战前，美国垄断资本所掌握的中东石油约占这一地区年产量的百分之十二，而到一九五三年美国已控制了中东石油产量的将近百分之六十。
    通过“援助”，美国资本加速了对亚非地区的渗入和扩张，在许多国家内排挤英、法等其他殖民国家的势力，榨取惊人的超额利润。今天，美国政府的“援助”亚洲计划越来越强调资本输出，它的真实意义就在这里。据统计，一九五三年美国对外投资的平均利润为百分之十三点六，而在亚非洲“落后地区”却为百分之二十五点六，其中个别国家甚至高达百分之三十。史塔生之流所吹嘘的帮助亚洲国家“工业化”，其虚伪性是可想而知了。印度国际问题专家达文曾经透彻地驳斥过美国这种所谓“协助”亚洲国家“工业化”的伪善口号，他说：“帮助‘友好’国家工业化和改变它的经济面貌，不是美国的任务……要是是那样的话，拉丁美洲的国家早已成为大工业国了。……在亚洲方面，美国政府的主要目的是为了在对共产党中国作战的时候，能取用亚洲广大的人力而已。对于改变亚洲国家为工业国这一点，它是没有兴趣的。”下面的数字也可以说明美国“援助”的经济掠夺意义。按照美国商务部出版的“商业现况”（一九五四年十一月号）的统计数字，一九五三年美国在亚洲和非洲地区的“直接投资”总额中，原料生产方面的投资占了百分之八十九以上，而制造业方面只占百分之三。即使这百分之三的美国资本，也决不是用来在这些国家发展独立的制造工业。美国的汽车公司因为拒绝在印度建立汽车制造厂而宁愿关闭它已开设的汽车装配厂，这是大家都知道的事情。
    美国垄断资本集团还把亚洲经济落后国家看作是输出危机的对象和倾销过剩商品的市场。而这在很大程度上又是通过“援助”的形式来完成的。美国军火商手中的大量剩余军火是美国政府热心于提供所谓“军事援助”的因素之一。大家也知道，美国向亚洲进行剩余商品和农产品的倾销是美国对亚洲国家的“经济援助”的重要内容。由于美国农产品过剩的危机愈来愈严重，美国总统在最近“援外”计划的报告中特别强调一项“广泛的剩余品处理计划”。这种“计划”实质上是以高出世界市场的价格，将大量剩余农产品倾销到受“援”国的市场。就是在“经济援助”的项目下，美国把成万吨的劣质的甚至腐烂的剩余小麦和棉花销给了印度、日本和其它受“援”国家。
    美国“援助”的性质既然是这样，自然绝不可能对受“援”国的经济产生有利的影响。事实上，人们看到，那些大量地接受了美“援”的亚洲国家，不仅丝毫谈不上工业化，而且国民经济受到了严重破坏。以菲律宾为例，菲律宾的军事预算一九五五年度比一九五三年度增加了一倍。美国商品的大量倾销窒息了菲律宾的民族工业。菲律宾全国有四百万人失业，占总人口的五分之一。前菲政府劳工部代部长基托里安诺也承认：“按人口比例计算，菲律宾可能是世界各国中失业最多的国家。”他又说：“菲律宾今天的生活水平，比二十年前还要低。”所以，“巴基斯坦时报”在评论美巴“援助”协定时所下的论断无疑是正确而中肯的，该报写道：美“援”协定“预示着一种殖民地形式的经济，其本质是落后国家的农业、工业、运输和交通都按照满足宗主国的需要来发展。”
    许多亚洲国家为了促进自己的经济得到独立的发展；为了摆脱几世纪以来殖民主义统治所造成的经济落后境况，它们是希望取得外国的真诚援助的。多少年来工业化一直是这些国家的人民和许多爱国的政治家们所梦寐以求的理想。在联合国历次讨论关于落后国家经济问题的会议上，不少亚洲国家的代表要求外国技术援助能符合于这些国家工业化的需要，要求不附条件的低利贷款，要求国际间正常的贸易关系和经济合作等等，可是华盛顿的代表对于所有这些丝毫也不感兴趣。华盛顿所感到兴趣的是在附有明显的军事、政治条件下，在受“援”国出让经济权益以保障美国垄断资本取得最大限度的利润的条件下，给予经济落后国家以“援助”。美国对亚洲的这种帝国主义性质的“援助”当然只能妨碍受“援”国家的正常经济发展，因而不可能不引起一切珍视本国独立、主权的政府的疑虑和不满，遭到各国人民的强烈反对。亚洲人民深切地理解到，要想使自己国家的经济走上独立发展的道路，决不能依靠帝国主义性质的“援助”，而应该依靠自力更生，同时在平等互利的基础上发展国际经济合作。今天的事实是，只要通过各国人民和政府的努力，建立和发展这种正常的国际经济合作关系的现实条件是完全存在着的。
