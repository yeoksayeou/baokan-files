Lathe operator Yuan Zhixian, a representative of the National People's Congress and a model worker of Chengdu, after half a year of research and experimentation, has finally successfully created a "multi-tool post" suitable for machining various products. In April, mechanical factories in Chengdu began to widely promote the advanced experience of the "multi-tool post."

The "multi-tool post" has been proven to have the following advantages through practical operation: 1. It can machine any product. It is of great importance to improve the production of mechanical factories with many complex products and unfixed products. 2. Work efficiency is more than doubled. Using the "multi-tool post," a product can be completely machined from roughing to final machining without stopping the machine, eliminating the auxiliary working hours of stopping to change tools and stopping to measure that were unavoidable on lathes in the past. 3. Improves product quality. Because the "multi-tool post" uses two indexing plates to flexibly control the diameter and length of the product, the quality tolerance can be controlled within one thread. In this way, precision products that previously required lathe operators of level five or above can now be made by lathe operators of level three or four. 4. Easy to popularize and promote. The modification of the "multi-tool post" is not limited by equipment conditions. As long as the original lathe is modified into two tool posts, one positive and one negative, the positive tool post is equipped with a fine turning tool and a cutting tool, the negative tool post is equipped with a roughing tool, and an additional tool post for turning the inner circle, and an indexing plate is added to the large handle. 5. The cutting force is greater than the original tool post, and the tool post can be kept stable. Advanced experiences such as high-speed cutting, multi-tool multi-edge, and the Kolesov rapid feed method can also be used on the "multi-tool post." (Reported by our correspondent in Chongqing)

    车工袁志先创造“多刀架”
    全国人民代表大会代表、成都市特等劳动模范、车工袁志先，经过半年钻研试验，终于创造成功一种适于车制各种产品的“多刀架”。四月间，成都各机械工厂，已开始普遍推广“多刀架”的先进经验。
      “多刀架”经实际操作证明，具有如下优点：一、任何产品都能车制。它对提高许多品种复杂、产品不固定的机械工厂的生产具有极大作用。二、工效提高一倍以上。采用“多刀架”，一件产品从粗车到最后车制成功，可以完全做到不停车，免除了过去车床上不可少的停车换刀、停车量活等辅助工时。三、提高了产品质量。“多刀架”上由于采用了两个分度盘来灵活地控制产品的直径和长短，使质量公差能控制在一丝以内。这样，过去要五级以上车工才能做的精密产品，现在三、四级车工也能做了。四、容易普及和推广。改制“多刀架”不受设备条件限制，只要把原车床改制成正反两个刀架，正刀架上装精车刀和切刀，反刀架上装粗刀，另外再加一个车内圆的刀架，和大摇柄上加一个分度盘就可以了。五、吃刀力量比原来的刀架大，并能保持刀架平稳。在“多刀架”上可以同样运用高速切削、多刀多刃、科列索夫快速走刀法等先进经验。　（本报驻重庆记者）
