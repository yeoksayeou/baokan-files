The CCP Liaoning Provincial Committee held a standing committee meeting on March 2nd to discuss the handling and inspection report by the CCP Anshan Municipal Committee regarding the incident of Kang Zhaowen, former secretary of the general branch of the small steel rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, stealing workers' creations and attacking and framing the main creator, worker Han Changxin.

The meeting unanimously agreed that Kang Zhaowen's act of using his position as deputy secretary of the Party's general branch to steal workers' rationalization proposals and attack and frame the main creator was extremely egregious in nature and seriously harmed the interests of the Party. For a long time after this incident occurred, it was not exposed. Furthermore, in the nearly two years after the incident, worker Han Changxin had reported the truth of the incident more than a hundred times to leading organs such as the Discipline Inspection Commission of the CCP Anshan Municipal Committee, the Ministry of Coal Industry, the office, the People's Reception Office, and the Supervision Office of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, as well as responsible cadres such as Han Tianshi, secretary of the Municipal Committee, and Fan Shulin and Zhao Jiaju, deputy ministers of the Municipal Committee's Industry and Mining Department. However, no organization or responsible cadre seriously handled the matter. From September 1954, after the incident was exposed, although the Anshan Municipal Committee had mobilized a large number of staff and conducted two large-scale investigations and fact-checking exercises, and had also held several Municipal Committee meetings and Standing Committee meetings for discussion, the Municipal Committee had consistently failed to recognize its primary responsibility. It had always maintained that the general branch committee of the small steel rolling mill should bear the main responsibility for the incident; the Municipal Committee's responsibility was merely that it had failed to cultivate the small steel rolling mill as a typical example and lacked political and ideological leadership in the mechanization and automation movement. Therefore, the meeting considered that the CCP Anshan Municipal Committee's self-criticism of this incident was not profound enough, and it must conduct a new self-criticism, specifically and profoundly examining the serious bureaucratic style of being aloof, not going deep into factories and mines, being detached from the masses, and not caring about the hardships of the masses, which the Municipal Committee demonstrated in this incident, and earnestly draw lessons from it and improve its work.

The meeting agreed with the decision made by the CCP Anshan Municipal Committee to expel Kang Zhaowen from the Party and the punishment of relevant personnel. At the same time, it pointed out that the main leading organs and main responsible cadres related to this incident should also conduct profound self-criticism.

Based on the criticism from the Standing Committee of the CCP Liaoning Provincial Committee, the CCP Anshan Municipal Committee convened another meeting on March 4th and conducted a new self-criticism. In this self-criticism, the Anshan Municipal Committee has recognized that the bureaucratic style of the Municipal Committee's leading organs and staff is extremely serious, and that the Municipal Committee should bear the main responsibility for not detecting Kang Zhaowen's mistakes early on. However, it still lacks specific analysis and criticism of the shortcomings and errors of the main departments of the Discipline Inspection Commission, the Industry and Mining Department, and the Municipal Committee Office led by the Municipal Committee, as well as the main responsible cadres related to this incident.

    中共辽宁省委讨论韩长信事件
    中共辽宁省委会在三月二日举行常委会议，讨论了中共鞍山市委会所作的关于前中共鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂总支委员会书记康兆文窃夺工人创造，并对主要创造者工人韩长信实行打击陷害事件的处理和检查报告。
    会议一致认为康兆文利用党的总支副书记的地位，窃夺工人的合理化建议，并对主要创造者施行打击陷害的事件，其性质是极为恶劣的，严重地损害了党的利益。这个事件发生之后很长时期内没有揭发出来，而且，在这个事件发生后的近两年中，工人韩长信曾经先后一百多次向中共鞍山市委纪律检查委员会、工矿部、办公室、人民接待室、鞍山钢铁公司监察室等领导机关和鞍山市委书记韩天石、市委工矿部副部长范树林、赵家驹等负责干部揭露这一事件的真相。但一直没有一个机构或一个负责干部认真负责地受理这个问题。从一九五四年九月，这个事件揭发以后，虽然鞍山市委会曾动员了大批的工作人员，进行了两次较大规模的调查和核对事实，也曾举行了几次市委会议和市委常委会议进行讨论。但是，市委会对自己应负的主要责任始终认识不足，一直认为小型轧钢厂的总支委员会对这个事件应负主要的责任；市委会的责任，只不过是没有把小型轧钢厂当作典型来培养，在机械化自动化运动中缺乏政治思想领导等等。因此，会议认为中共鞍山市委会对这一事件的检讨是不深刻的，必须重新进行检讨，具体地深刻地检讨市委会在这一事件中所表现的高高在上、不深入厂矿、脱离群众、不关心群众疾苦的严重的官僚主义作风，切实地从中吸取教训，改进工作。
    会议同意中共鞍山市委会所作的关于开除康兆文党籍的决定和对有关人员的处分，同时指出有关这一事件的主要领导机关和主要负责干部也都要进行深刻的检讨。
    根据中共辽宁省委常委会的批评，中共鞍山市委会于三月四日又召开了会议，重新作了检讨。鞍山市委这次检讨已经认识到市委的领导机关和工作人员的官僚主义作风极其严重，市委对于康兆文错误没有及早察觉，是要负主要责任的，但是，对于市委所领导的纪律检查委员会、工矿部、市委办公室主要部门和有关这一事件的主要负责干部的缺点和错误，仍然缺乏具体的分析和批判。
