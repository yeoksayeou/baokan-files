Chairman, Representatives, Friends:

Our Indian friend, Dr. Anup Singh, has given us a very substantial and important report, which I think we can use as a basis for discussion. Now, please allow me to add some opinions from the Chinese people regarding peaceful coexistence. We, the Chinese people, as one of the joint proposers of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, feel extremely honored.

From the day the new China was founded, we declared to the world: we are willing to establish relations with any foreign government on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. For several years, we have been implementing this policy. We have established diplomatic relations with twenty-three countries, are preparing to establish them with three countries, and have also engaged in close economic and cultural contacts with many countries.

In June 1950, our friendly neighbor, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, was subjected to aggression by the American warmongering clique, and our territory of Taiwan was also occupied at the same time. Therefore, we had to rise up and, together with the Korean people, jointly repel the aggressors and extinguish the flames of war that almost spread to the entire Asia.

Last July, at the Geneva Conference, we, together with other relevant countries, reached an agreement to restore peace in Indochina, which also stopped the eight-year war in Indochina.

These are concrete manifestations of our persistent policy of peaceful diplomacy. We sincerely wish to establish normal diplomatic relations with Asian countries and even countries all over the world on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We firmly believe that as long as we can support and abide by these five principles, normal relations between any countries can be established, and can be consolidated and developed.

However, the ruling groups of some countries are extremely hostile to the principle of peaceful coexistence. This January, U.S. Secretary of State Mr. Dulles published an article in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's journal "Nation's Business," in which he made the following very resentful rebuke: "Peaceful coexistence is a tricky new word." He also said: "This is a word that should be noted, a word that must be guarded against." Last July 2nd, just a few days after the joint statement of the Prime Ministers of China and India was published, the American publication "U.S. News & World Report" also said this: The concept of peaceful coexistence "is a poison for American officials."

Why is it that peaceful coexistence, which is enthusiastically supported by the people of all countries, is so deeply hated by American officials, especially by figures like Mr. Dulles?

The reason is very simple. That is because the concept of peaceful coexistence is completely opposed to the "power politics" of neocolonialism embraced by the American ruling class.

In World War II, the United States did not suffer direct disasters and gained excess war profits, thus accelerating the development of its monopoly capital. Moreover, the discovery of atomic energy was temporarily monopolized by the U.S. government and limited to military use. This inspired the ambition of the American ruling clique to dominate the world. They actively took steps to rearm West Germany in Europe, and took a series of measures in Asia, the purpose of which was nothing more than to restore colonialism in Asia.

According to incomplete statistics, the United States has established many military bases in fifty countries around the world. Taking Asian countries alone, there are as many as eight hundred U.S. military bases in Japan, averaging one U.S. military base every four hundred and sixty square kilometers. At the same time, there are also many bases occupied by the U.S. military in the Philippines, Thailand, and other Asian countries. Such a situation is truly unprecedented.

Based on such a neocolonialist world policy, the measures taken by the American ruling clique are all in opposition to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We demand mutual respect for sovereignty, but the United States tramples on the sovereignty of others in everything; we demand mutual respect for territorial integrity, but the United States occupies the territory of others everywhere; we demand non-interference in internal affairs, but the United States interferes in the internal affairs of others at all times; we demand equality and mutual benefit, but the United States implements blockade and monopoly; we demand peaceful coexistence, but the United States specializes in provoking hatred, creating confrontation, and wants to call on "Asians to fight Asians, Europeans to fight Europeans" so that it can profit from it.

The American warmongering clique wants to turn the Pacific Ocean into the inland sea of the United States. On September 1, 1951, the "ANZUS Security Treaty" was signed in San Francisco, and on September 8 of the same year, the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" was signed. What is the meaning of these "security"? It is nothing more than adding countless U.S. military bases in Australia, New Zealand and Japan.

Two years ago, the American warmongering clique was forced to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement. But less than three months after the armistice, before the ink on the armistice agreement was dry, the U.S. government and the Syngman Rhee government concluded a "Mutual Defense Treaty," stipulating that the United States has the right to station land, sea, and air forces in southern Korea indefinitely. Later, it has been hindering the further peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and even the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which guarantees the implementation of the armistice agreement, is regarded as a thorn in its side.

Obviously, what the peace-loving people of the world like is what the American war clique dislikes. Last July, the Geneva Conference reached an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina. The United States not only did not sign the agreement, but hurriedly convened an eight-nation conference in Manila and concluded the so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty," but only three of them are Asian countries. Mr. Dulles openly stated at the recent Bangkok meeting that he wanted to install "teeth" on this treaty to prepare for war.

A few years ago, MacArthur, while commanding the Korean War, announced that he would establish a "chain of islands in the Western Pacific." Now this chain has been further expanded, and the American warmongering clique has openly announced that it will establish a "crescent-shaped encirclement" from Northeast Asia to the Near and Middle East, creating a military encirclement of the entire Asian continent.

In this way, part of the world policy of the American ruling clique is to conquer the entire Asia and establish a new type of colonial empire in Asia. This is the fundamental reason why American officials, especially people like Mr. Dulles, particularly hate the beautiful concept of "peaceful coexistence."

Here, please allow me to specifically bring up the Taiwan issue to the conference. The Taiwan issue is a focus of international tension. Taiwan is Chinese territory, just like Long Island is American territory. Although Britain's Mr. Churchill and Mr. Eden want to deny historical facts and erase various international agreements, and swallow what they have said, and put forward the statement that "the sovereignty of Taiwan is undetermined," the fact that the sovereignty of Taiwan belongs to China cannot be denied even by the American ruling clique that occupies Taiwan. If Taiwan is not Chinese territory, and the sovereignty of Taiwan does not belong to China, then the American ruling clique has no need to use the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique as a puppet at all. The essence of the Taiwan issue is very simple, that is, the American ruling clique has occupied Chinese territory. The existence of Chiang Kai-shek is just a shadow. Without the support of American armed forces, Chiang Kai-shek, who has been abandoned by the Chinese people, would have no space for him to exist long ago.

In June 1950, while launching the Korean War of aggression, then-President Truman ordered the Seventh Fleet to blockade the Taiwan Strait. Since then, the United States has occupied our Taiwan and nearby coastal islands. It uses Chiang Kai-shek as a guise, and for several years has been constantly carrying out harassing and destructive wars against the Chinese mainland, and has been engaging in pirate-like behavior on the ocean, looting commercial ships. This is well known.

In order to defend our own territory and the security of our motherland, the Chinese people want to liberate Taiwan, just like the Indian people want to recover Goa and the Indonesian people want to recover West Irian. This is our sacred duty. But to perform this duty, it cannot but conflict with the so-called "rights and security" of the aggressors. In this way, the U.S. government openly concluded a so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with Chiang Kai-shek last December, attempting to legalize the illegal occupation with an illegal treaty. This January, President Eisenhower was granted special powers by the U.S. Congress, in order to "protect American rights and security," sent troops to the Taiwan Strait, 11,000 kilometers away from the United States, to provoke war against the Chinese people, and constantly threatened to use atomic weapons. It is said that returning Taiwan to China would create a "crack in the chain of islands in the Western Pacific."

Isn't such domineering behavior of the American warmongers still not blatant enough? Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech in the Indian Parliament on March 31, condemning the American occupation of Taiwan, in which one sentence can be said to have sharply exposed the atrocities of the warmongers. He said: "You have violated every example of logic, reason, and conscience." The words and deeds of the American warmongers under the world policy of neocolonialism are all "violations of logic, reason, and conscience." To understand the logic of the American warmongers, there is a best shortcut, that is, to interpret it from the opposite side. What they call "security" is disruption, "peace" is war, "defense" is aggression, "protecting freedom" is enslavement, "preventing subversion" is interference, "economic assistance" is annexation... There is no need to give more examples of such words. But conversely, the opposite words they use should also be interpreted from the opposite side. The American warmongers love to accuse others of being "aggressors." They love to say "the Korean people invaded Korea," "the Vietnamese people invaded Vietnam," "the Chinese people invaded Taiwan." They say that the tension in the Far East comes from the Chinese people's "invasion of Taiwan." This is their logic. If we understand their logic and understand it from the opposite meaning, then we can make everything clearer.

Where does the tension in Asia and even the tension in the world come from? In a word, it comes from the United States; the colonialists headed by the United States are trying to continue to enslave the Asian people and enslave all mankind. This is the only root cause of tension.

The Indian people want to recover Goa, and we Chinese people fully support it. I believe that the peace-loving people of all Asian countries will also fully support it. But the U.S. government is different. The U.S. government and Portugal have concluded a so-called "Mutual Assistance and Common Defense Treaty," and are building military bases in Portuguese Goa. The Indonesian people want to recover West Irian, and we Chinese people fully support it. I believe that the peace-loving people of all Asian countries will also fully support it. But the U.S. government is different. The U.S. government has always supported the Dutch occupation, because the Netherlands has given the United States the guarantee to build military bases in West Irian.

From this, it can be seen that the "rights" of the colonialists are deeply contradictory to our demands to defend territorial integrity. But can we abandon our sacred duty to maintain the "rights" of the colonialists? That should not be the case. In order to protect his own "rights," the colonialist does not hesitate to use war or even atomic war to threaten. Can we be frightened by him? That should not be the case.

Here, I want to say a few frank and honest words on behalf of the Chinese people. Although we love peace, we will never sacrifice our own territory to beg for peace from the invaders; although we firmly oppose war, we will never be frightened by any war threats. Like our generation, and even like the generation of my father and grandfather, we have grown up under the threat of war and massacre by colonialists. We Chinese people have gone through a hundred years of struggle against aggression and finally gained liberation. We must never abandon our independence and freedom and be enslaved by others again.

Some kind-hearted friends - I am talking about friends, not friends who are not here - cannot withstand the threats of war mongers, so they hold a proposition of appeasement. They believe that for the sake of peace and security, it seems that a little concession can be made to the tyrant; let Taiwan be separated from China under American protection or in other forms, so that "two Chinas" can be maintained in peace, wouldn't that be okay? Although such a proposition comes from good intentions, it is not practical. This is not a question of "two Chinas". Taiwan under American "protection" is not another "China", but another candidate state of the United States. The United States regards Taiwan as a military base for attacking the Chinese mainland and the entire Asia, and it is the middle road in the three-pronged attack. If we allow the tyranny of the United States to develop in this way, then there will not only be no "two Chinas", but in the end even one China cannot be preserved. The tragic experience of history has taught us that Chamberlain's Munich policy towards Nazi Germany almost lost the entire Europe, and Chiang Kai-shek's policy of non-resistance to the Japanese occupation of the Northeast region almost buried the entire China; and it is not only limited to the problems of Europe and China, but the impact has affected the entire world.

Therefore, we Chinese people must never back down from the war threats of the American warmongers. We want to liberate Taiwan for the security of our motherland, and also for the peace of Asia and the peace of the world. We Chinese people are by no means a war-loving nation. If the Taiwan issue can be resolved peacefully, we are not unable to agree. Our Beijing was liberated peacefully. But to peacefully liberate Taiwan, there is a prerequisite that must be resolved here, that is, all the armed forces of the United States Navy, Army and Air Force that occupy Taiwan must withdraw. We thank our Indian friends for holding the "U.S. Troops Withdraw from Taiwan Day" on February 6, which touched on the key to solving the Taiwan issue. On this point, I can clearly express the will of our Chinese people: We can agree to the proposal to convene a ten-nation conference to discuss the Taiwan issue. These ten countries are India, the Soviet Union, Burma, the United Kingdom, France, the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, Ceylon, the United States, and Pakistan. Perhaps someone will ask: Why can't the Chiang Kai-shek group participate? Our answer is this: Chiang Kai-shek is just a puppet of the United States. We can never agree that the U.S. government will hold a puppet on stage at a conference to discuss peace. As long as the U.S. government is sincere about peace, our government can sit down and negotiate with it at any time. We have always advocated resolving international disputes through peaceful consultation, and we have already done so in Panmunjom and Geneva. On the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, we believe that not only can the Taiwan issue be resolved, but also all other international issues in Asia and the world can be resolved.

A week ago, Prime Minister Nehru said well in the Indian Parliament: The Five Principles are a challenge that Asia has put forward to other regions of the world. "Every country must give a straightforward answer to this challenge." The Prime Minister said that he hopes that "the Asian-African Conference will put forward this issue straightforwardly and unambiguously, and ask every country to state whether it agrees to non-aggression and non-interference." At this Asian Countries Conference, we have already "put forward this issue straightforwardly and unambiguously." We want to specifically ask the U.S. government to state whether it "agrees to non-aggression and non-interference."

Dear friends, this conference of ours is a conference of great significance in the historical transformation process of the people of Asian countries breaking away from the old era and the old life and moving towards the new era and the new life. In the past and present, we have been threatened by colonialists in the same way, so in defending national independence and freedom, defending our peaceful life and the cause of world peace, our interests are completely consistent.

The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have made us increasingly closely united. We believe that any differences in social systems and beliefs are not enough to create estrangement between us. With the Five Principles, any problems between us can be resolved through consultation.

Therefore, I would like to specifically ask the Chairman and all dear friends to allow me to specifically express the Chinese people's concern for the people of Japan, Thailand, and the countries of the Near and Middle East.

Now, the Japanese people's call for the Japanese government to restore normal relations with China is getting higher and higher. The Chinese people fully sympathize with and welcome this legitimate and friendly wish of the Japanese people. In fact, the obstacles hindering the establishment of normal relations between Japan and China do not come from China or the Japanese people themselves, but as a result of the U.S. government's pressure on the Japanese government from all angles.

The Chinese people clearly know that only when the Japanese people get rid of the shackles of foreign occupation, realize their complete political and economic independence, and establish close friendship with Asian countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence can the sinister conspiracy of certain Western countries to revive Japanese militarism as the main force for "Asians to fight Asians" be eradicated. I believe that the people of Asian countries welcome any achievements of the Japanese people in this noble cause in the same way as the Chinese people. Recently, the Japanese people have achieved more than 23 million signatures in the movement against atomic weapons, which is a very important historical event, and we should congratulate the heroic and peace-loving Japanese people.

Thailand is the country that hosted the recent Bangkok conference, which was not for peace but for preparing for war. We fully sympathize with the unfortunate situation currently encountered by the Thai people, and firmly believe that far-sighted politicians and the Thai people will eventually understand that Thailand's freedom and independence can never be achieved by relying on trusting foreigners to build military bases everywhere in their territory and allowing any foreigners to manipulate their foreign policy. The real guarantee of Thailand's independent freedom is to return to the Asian family. We feel very sorry that the representative of Thailand has not been able to participate in this conference of ours for various reasons. But I believe that at the next conference, one day, the representatives selected by the Thai people will come and discuss Asian issues of common concern with us.

The Chinese people and the Arab countries are separated by high mountains and seas, but we have had a long history of friendship. We have engaged in frequent trade and exchanged ideas and scientific and artistic achievements. Since the fifteenth century, our contacts have gradually decreased and finally almost completely stopped. But now a new world-shaking change has taken place. Many Eastern countries have broken away from foreign rule. The people of the Near and Middle East countries demand peace, freedom, national independence and cooperation with the people of all countries. The Chinese delegation pays its warm respects to the delegations of Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, and through them to the people of their countries. Now we are restoring our cultural and economic exchanges. The Chinese people recently sent an exhibition working group to Syria, which received a friendly welcome from the people there, which is a good start.

Chairman, dear friends, before I end my speech, please allow me to put forward the following suggestions on behalf of the Chinese delegation as a reference for the resolution document. I have four suggestions:

	(1) We fully support the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This should become the charter of international relations in our era, opening the way for peace, progress and prosperity for all countries. We call on the governments of all countries, especially the governments of Asian countries, to accept these lofty five principles and work together in various ways to expand the area of peace and establish collective peace and security.
	(2) We call on the people of Asian countries to unite and resolutely oppose the use of weapons of mass destruction such as atomic weapons, biological weapons and chemical weapons, and demand universal disarmament, a ban on the testing and stockpiling of atomic weapons, and the establishment of atomic bases. The World Peace Council issued a "Letter to the People of the World" in January this year to collect signatures against atomic war, which fully and powerfully expressed the righteous sentiment of the whole world against atomic weapons. We call on the people and governments of all countries to oppose preparations for atomic war in various ways, especially to respond to and expand the signature collection movement called for by the World Peace Council. We support the peaceful use of atomic energy and are concerned about international negotiations on the peaceful application of atomic energy. But it must be pointed out that only after the use of atomic energy for military purposes is prohibited can mankind fully use atomic energy for peaceful industrial purposes.
	(3) We call on the people of Asian countries to unite and strive for a reasonable and early resolution of the following three fundamental issues that cause and exacerbate the current tension in the Asian region: (a) Demand an end to the United States' aggression against China's territory Taiwan and other islands and unreasonable interference in China's internal affairs. All U.S. armed forces must withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. (b) Demand that all countries participating in the Geneva Conference strictly abide by the agreement on the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue and realize the peaceful reunification desired by the people of Indochina. (c) Demand the prompt convening of a conference involving relevant countries and neutral Asian countries to discuss the peaceful reunification of Korea, demand the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, and oppose the violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement.
	(4) We call on the people of Asian countries to unite to oppose and defeat all plans and conspiracies of aggressive groups, such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, to make Asians fight Asians. Demand an end to foreign rule and interference in various parts of Asia, including West Irian, Goa and Malaya, withdraw all foreign military forces from Asian land, and abolish all foreign military bases in Asia.

Dear friends! Our Asian countries have more than 1.4 billion people. As long as we can unite strongly on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, our strength will be unparalleled. Although the colonialists are still constantly threatening us with war and enslavement, and at the same time tempting us with money and "aid," we will not be intimidated or deceived. We firmly believe in our own strength. We have the support of the peace-loving people of other continents of the world.

As long as we can continue to enhance our mutual understanding, strengthen our independent and free lives, and have the opportunity to fully develop ourselves, the people of Asian countries with a long history and cultural traditions will undoubtedly make new and important contributions worthy of our ancestors to the great cause of ensuring world peace and promoting human happiness.

    亚洲人民团结起来为实现和平共处而斗争
    ——中国代表团团长郭沫若在亚洲国家会议上的发言主席先生、代表们、朋友们：
    我们的印度朋友阿努普·辛格博士为我们作了一个很充实的、很重要的报告，我认为我们是可以把它作为讨论的基础的。现在请允许我把中国人民关于和平共处的认识补充一些意见。我们中国人民作为和平共处五项原则的共同提倡者之一，是感到极大的光荣的。
    自新中国成立的一天起，我们就向全世界宣告过：愿在平等互利及互相尊重领土主权等原则的基础上，和任何外国政府建立关系。几年来我们一直是执行着这样的政策的，我们和二十三个国家已经建立外交关系，和三个国家正在准备建立中，还和许多国家进行了经济上和文化上的密切接触。
    一九五零年六月，我们的友邦朝鲜民主主义人民共和国受到美国好战集团的侵略，我们的领土台湾也同时遭受到侵占，因此我们不能不起来，和朝鲜人民一道，共同打退了侵略者，扑灭了几乎燃烧到整个亚洲的战火。
    去年七月，我们在日内瓦会议上同其他有关国家一起，达成了恢复印度支那和平的协议，把延续了八年的印度支那的战争也停止了下来。
    这些都是我们所坚持的和平外交政策的具体表现。我们是深切地愿意在和平共处五项原则的基础上，和亚洲各国乃至世界各国建立正常的外交关系的。我们坚决相信，只要我们能够支持并遵守这五项原则，任何国家之间的正常关系都可以建立起来，而且可以巩固和发展下去。
    但是有些国家的统治集团对于和平共处的原则却是加以极端仇视的。今年一月美国国务卿杜勒斯先生在美国商会的机关刊物“全国商业”杂志上发表了一篇文章，其中有这样十分痛恨的斥责：“和平共处是一个狡诈的新字眼”。他又说：“这是一个应该加以注意的字眼，一个必须加以警戒的字眼。”去年七月二日，就是中印两国总理联合声明发表后的不几天，美国刊物“美国新闻与世界报道”也曾经说过这样的话：和平共处的观念“对于美国官员是一种毒素”。
    为什么为世界各国人民所热烈支持的和平共处，竟为美国官方特别像杜勒斯先生那样的人物所如此深恶痛绝呢？
    这理由是很简单的。那就是由于和平共处的观念与美国统治阶级所怀抱的新殖民主义的“实力政策”完全处于对蹠的地位。
    在第二次世界大战中，美国没有受到直接的灾害，而且获得了超额的战争利润，因此更加速了它的垄断资本的发展。又由于原子能的发现被美国政府所一时垄断，并限于军事上的利用，这样便启发了美国统治集团的独霸全世界的野心。他们在欧洲积极地采取了重新武装西德的步骤，在亚洲更采取了一系列的措施，其目的不外是恢复殖民主义在亚洲的统治。
    据不完全的统计，美国在全世界五十个国家内建立了许多军事基地。单就亚洲国家来说，日本国内美国所占用的军事基地就有八百处之多，平均每四百六十多平方公里就有一个美军基地。同时，在菲律宾、泰国和其他亚洲国家，也有许多美军占用的基地。这样的情况实在是史无前例的。
    根据这样的新殖民主义的世界政策，美国统治集团所采取的措施，没有一样不和和平共处五原则相对抗。我们要求互相尊重主权，而美国却事事蹂躏别人的主权；我们要求互相尊重领土的完整，美国却处处霸占别人的领土；我们要求互不干涉内政，而美国却时时都在干涉别人的内政；我们要求平等互利，而美国则执行封锁独占；我们要求和平共处，而美国则专门挑拨仇恨、制造对垒，它要叫
  “亚洲人打亚洲人，欧洲人打欧洲人”，以便它于中取利。
    美国好战集团要把太平洋弄成美国的内海。一九五一年九月一日在旧金山签订了“美澳新三国安全条约”，同年九月八日签订了“美日安全条约”。这些“安全”的意义是什么呢？那就不外是在澳大利亚、新西兰和日本增加了无数的美国军事基地。
    前年七月美国好战集团被迫签订了朝鲜停战协定。但是停战后不及三个月，停战协定的墨汁未干，在美国政府与李承晚政府之间便缔结了“共同防御条约”，规定美国有权无限期地在南部朝鲜驻扎陆、海、空军部队，以后更一直阻挠着朝鲜问题的进一步的和平解决，连保证执行停战协定的中立国监察委员会都被视为眼中钉。
    很显然，全世界爱好和平的人民所喜欢的，就是美国战争集团所不高兴的。去年七月，日内瓦会议对于恢复印度支那的和平达成协议，美国不仅没有在协定上签字，而且急急忙忙地在马尼拉召集八国会议，缔结了所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”，但其中属于亚洲的国家只有三个。杜勒斯先生在最近召开的曼谷会议上竟公然表示，要为这个条约装上
  “牙齿”，来准备战争。
    几年前，麦克阿瑟在指挥朝鲜战争的时候，曾经宣布要建立一个“西太平洋的岛屿锁链”，现在这个锁链是更加扩大了，美国好战集团已公开宣布要建立一个从东北亚到中近东的“新月形包围圈”，对整个亚洲大陆造成一个军事的大包围。
    这样，美国统治集团的世界政策的一部分就是要征服整个亚洲，要在亚洲从新建立一个新型的殖民主义帝国，这就是美国的官方，特别像杜勒斯先生那样的人，所以特别憎恨“和平共处”这个优美观念的根本原因。
    在这里请允许我把台湾问题特别向大会提出。台湾问题是国际紧张局势的一个焦点。台湾是中国的领土，犹如长岛是美国的领土。尽管英国的邱吉尔先生和艾登先生要否认史实，并抹煞各种国际协定，并吞食自己所说过的话，竟提出了“台湾主权未定”的说法，但关于台湾主权属于中国这一点，就是侵占着台湾的美国统治集团也是不能否认的。假使台湾不是中国的领土，台湾的主权不是属于中国，那末美国统治集团便根本没有把蒋介石卖国集团作为傀儡的必要了。台湾问题的本质很简单，那就是美国统治集团侵占了中国的领土。蒋介石的存在，只是一个影子，没有美国武装力量的支持，被中国人民唾弃了的蒋介石早就没有空间让他存在着了。
    一九五零年六月美国在发动侵略朝鲜战争的同时，前任总统杜鲁门命令第七舰队封锁台湾海峡，从那时起，美国就侵占着我们的台湾和附近的沿海岛屿。它把蒋介石作为幌子，几年来不断地对中国大陆进行骚扰性的和破坏性的战争，而在海洋上面则采取着海盗式的行为，掳掠通商贸易的船舶，这是人所共知的。
    为了保卫自己的领土和祖国的安全，中国人民要解放台湾，就像印度人民要收复果阿，印度尼西亚人民要收复西伊里安一样，是我们的神圣的职责。但要执行这种职责，那就不能不和侵略者的所谓“权利与安全”相抵触了。就这样，美国政府在去年十二月竟公然和蒋介石缔结了一个所谓“共同防御条约”，企图以非法的条约使非法的侵占合法化。今年一月，艾森豪威尔总统得到美国国会授予他的特权，为了“保护美国的权利和安全”，离开美国一万一千公里，陈兵台湾海峡，对中国人民进行战争挑衅，并不断地以使用原子武器相威胁。据说让台湾归还中国，那就会在“西太平洋的岛屿锁链中造成一个裂口”。
    美国好战分子们的这样的横行霸道难道还不算十分露骨吗？尼赫鲁总理三月三十一日在印度国会人民院中发表了斥责美国侵占台湾的演说，其中有一句话可以说是一针见血地揭穿了好战分子们的暴行。他说：“你是违反了逻辑、理智和良知的每一典例了”。美国好战分子们在新殖民主义的世界政策之下的所言所行，一切都是这样“违反了逻辑、理智和良知”的。要了解美国好战分子们的逻辑，倒有一个最好的捷径，那就是从反面去解释它。他们所说的“安全”就是扰乱，“和平”就是战争，
  “防御”就是侵略，“保护自由”就是奴役，“防止颠覆”就是干涉，“经济援助”就是吞并……这样的词汇可不必再事多举了。但反过来，对于他们所用的相反的词汇也同样地应该从反面去解释。美国好战分子们最爱指责别人为“侵略者”，他们爱说“朝鲜人民侵略朝鲜”，“越南人民侵略越南”，“中国人民侵略台湾”。他们说，远东的紧张局势是由中国人民要“侵略台湾”而来。这就是他们的逻辑。如果我们懂得了他们的逻辑，从相反的意义上去了解，那我们就可以把一切真相弄得更明白了。
    亚洲的紧张局势乃至世界的紧张局势究竟从何而来？一句话归总：就是从美国而来；以美国为首的殖民主义者企图继续奴役亚洲人民并奴役全人类，这就是造成紧张局势的唯一根源。
    印度人民要收复果阿，我们中国人民是完全支持的，我相信亚洲各国爱好和平的人民也都会完全支持的，但是美国政府却是两样。美国政府和葡萄牙缔结了所谓“互助与共同防御条约”，却正在葡萄牙属果阿建立军事基地。印度尼西亚人民要收复西伊里安，我们中国人民是完全支持的，我相信，亚洲各国爱好和平的人民也都会完全支持的。但是美国政府却是两样，美国政府则一贯支持荷兰的侵占，因为荷兰已经给予美国在西伊里安建立军事基地的保证。
    由此可见，殖民主义者的“权利”和我们保卫领土完整的要求是深相抵触的。但我们能够为维持殖民主义者的“权利”而放弃自己的神圣职责吗？那是不应该的。殖民主义者为了保护他自己的“权利”，不惜用战争乃至原子战争来进行威胁，难道我们能被他吓倒吗？那是不应该的。
    我在这里要代表中国人民说几句坦率和诚实的话。我们虽然热爱和平，但决不会牺牲自己的领土，去向侵占者乞求和平；我们虽然坚决反对战争，但决不会被任何战争威胁所吓倒。像我们这一代乃至像我的父亲和祖父的一代，都是在殖民主义者的战争和屠杀的威胁之下成长起来的。我们中国人民经历了一百年的反抗侵略的斗争，而终于获得了解放，我们决不能再抛弃自己的独立自由而受别人的奴役。
    有一些好心肠的朋友——我所说的是朋友，不是朋友皆不在此例——经受不住战争叫嚣者的威胁，因而也就怀抱着一种绥靖主义的主张。他们认为：为了和平与安全，对于横暴者似乎可以退让一点；就让台湾在美国保护下或在别种形式下脱离中国，这样维持着“两个中国”不就可以相安无事了吗？这样的主张尽管是出于好心肠吧，然而是不切实际的。这并不是“两个中国”的问题。台湾在美国的“保护”下并不是又一个“中国”，而是美国的又一个候补州。美国是把台湾作为进攻中国大陆和整个亚洲的军事基地的，而且是三路进攻中的一条中路，假使我们苟且偷安地听任美国的横暴这样发展下去，那末不仅不会有“两个中国”，到结局是连一个中国也不能保存了。历史的惨痛经验教育了我们：张伯伦对纳粹德国的慕尼黑政策几乎沦陷了整个欧洲，蒋介石对日本侵占东北地区的不抵抗主义几乎葬送了整个中国；而且还不仅是限于欧洲和中国的问题，影响所及，已经波及整个世界了。
    因此对于美国好战分子的战争威胁，我们中国人民是绝对不能退让的。我们要解放台湾是为了祖国的安全，同时也是为了亚洲的和平与世界的和平。我们中国人民决不是好战的民族，如果对于台湾问题能够采取和平的办法来解决，我们也并不是不能同意。我们的北京便是和平解放出来的。但要和平解放台湾，在这里有一个必须解决的先决条件，那便是侵占着台湾的美国的海陆空军一切武装力量必须撤走。我们感谢印度的朋友们，他们在二月六日曾经举行过美军“撤出台湾日”，那是接触到了台湾问题的解决关键的。在这一点上，我可以明白地表达我们中国人民的意志：我们能够同意召开十国会议的建议来讨论台湾问题，这十国就是印度、苏联、缅甸、英国、法国、中华人民共和国、印度尼西亚、锡兰、美国和巴基斯坦。或许有人要问：蒋介石集团为什么不可以参加？我们的回答是这样：蒋介石只是美国的傀儡，在讨论和平的会议上我们决不能同意美国政府还要抱着傀儡登场，只要美国政府对于和平有诚意，我们的政府随时都可以坐下来和它进行谈判。我们向来是主张采取和平协商的方式解决国际争端的，而且在板门店和日内瓦都已经这样做了。在和平共处的五项原则的基础之上，我们认为不仅可以解决台湾问题，而且可以解决亚洲的和世界的其他国际间的一切问题。
    一个星期前，尼赫鲁总理在印度人民院说得好：五项原则是亚洲向世界其他地区提出的挑战。
  “每一个国家都必须对这种挑战给予直截了当的回答”。总理先生说，他希望“亚非会议将直截了当、毫不含糊地提出这个问题来，并要求每一个国家都说明它是不是赞成互不侵犯，互不干涉”。在这亚洲国家会议上，我们已经“直截了当、毫不含糊地提出了这个问题来”。我们要特别地要求美国政府说明它究竟是不是“赞成互不侵犯、互不干涉”。
    亲爱的朋友们，我们这次会议是亚洲各国人民脱离旧时代、旧生活而走向新时代、新生活的历史转变过程中的一个具有重要意义的会议。在过去和现在，我们所受到的殖民主义者的威胁是一样的，因而在保卫民族独立自由、保卫我们的和平生活和世界和平事业中，我们的利益也是完全一致的。
    和平共处的五项原则使我们日益亲密地团结了起来。我们相信，任何社会制度和信仰的不同，都不足以造成我们之间的隔阂。有了五项原则，我们之间的任何问题，都可以协商解决。
    因此，我要特别要求主席先生和各位亲爱的朋友的允许，让我特别向日本人民、泰国人民和中近东各国人民表达一下中国人民对于他们的关切。
    现在日本人民要求日本政府与中国恢复正常关系的呼声是愈来愈高了。中国人民完全同情并欢迎日本人民的这一正当而友谊的愿望，事实上，阻挠着日本与中国建立正常关系的障碍，并不是来自中国或日本人民本身，而是由于美国政府对日本政府由一切角度施加压力的结果。
    中国人民清楚地知道，只有日本人民摆脱了外国占领的束缚，实现其政治上经济上的完全独立，和亚洲各国在和平共处五项原则基础上建立亲密友谊关系，才能根绝西方某些国家复活日本军国主义以作为“亚洲人打亚洲人”的主力的险毒的阴谋。我相信，亚洲各国人民是和中国人民同样地欢迎日本人民在这一崇高事业上的任何成就的。最近以来，日本人民在反对原子武器的运动上得到了二千三百多万人签名的成绩，是一件很重要的历史事件，我们应该向英勇而爱好和平的日本人民表示祝贺。
    泰国是在最近的曼谷会议作了主人的国家，这个会议不是为了和平而是为了准备战争的。我们十分同情泰国人民目前所遭遇的不幸境遇，并坚信泰国有远见的政治家们和泰国人民终有机会明白，泰国的自由独立，绝不能倚靠信任外国人在自己境内到处建立军事基地和任何外国人摆布自己的对外政策来取得的。泰国的独立自由的真正保障，是回到亚洲大家庭里面来，我们感到非常遗憾，泰国的代表由于种种原因未能参加我们这一会议。但我相信在下次会议上，终有一天，泰国人民所挑选出来的代表，是会和我们一道来讨论大家共同关心的亚洲问题的。
    中国人民与阿拉伯各国之间是被高山大海所隔着的，然而我们之间曾有过悠久的历史友谊。我们曾进行过频繁的贸易往来，交流了思想和科学艺术的成就。自从十五世纪以来，我们的接触逐渐减少，最后几乎完全停止了。但是现在已发生了新的震动世界的变化。许多东方国家已挣脱了外国的统治。中近东国家的人民是要求和平、自由、民族独立并且与各国人民合作的。中国代表团向叙利亚、黎巴嫩与约旦等国代表团并通过它们向它们国家的人民致以热烈的敬意。现在我们已在恢复着我们的文化和经济交流。中国人民不久之前曾派了一个展览工作团到叙利亚，受到了那里人民的充满着友爱的欢迎，这就是一个良好的开端。
    主席先生、亲爱的朋友们，在我结束发言之前，请允许我代表中国代表团提出如下建议，作为决议文件的参考。我的建议有四点：
      （一）我们完全拥护和平共处五项原则。这应当成为我们这个时代的国际关系的宪章，要为各国的和平、进步与繁荣开辟道路。我们向各国政府，首先是亚洲各国的政府呼吁接受这崇高的五项原则，通过各种不同的方式，为扩大和平地区、建立集体和平和安全而共同努力。
      （二）我们号召亚洲各国人民团结起来，坚决反对使用大规模毁灭性的原子武器、细菌武器和化学武器，要求实行普遍裁军，禁止试验、储藏原子武器，和建立原子基地。世界和平理事会在今年一月发布了“告全世界人民书”征集反对原子战争的签名运动，使全世界憎恶原子武器的正义情绪得到了充分的有力表现，我们要求一切国家的人民和政府，以各种方式反对准备原子战争，特别是响应并扩大世界和平理事会所号召的征集签名运动。我们拥护和平利用原子能，并关心关于和平应用原子能的国际谈判。但必须指出：只有禁止了把原子能用于军事方面之后，人类才能充分地把原子能用于和平的工业用途。
      （三）我们号召亚洲各国人民团结起来，为争取合理地和及早地解决下面三个造成和加剧了目前亚洲地区紧张局势的基本问题而努力：（甲）要求结束美国对中国领土台湾及其他岛屿的侵略和对中国内政的无理干涉，必须从台湾及台湾海峡撤退一切美国武装力量。（乙）要求所有参加日内瓦会议的国家，严格遵守关于和平解决印度支那问题的协议，实现印度支那人民所愿望的和平统一。（丙）要求迅速举行有关国家和有中立的亚洲国家参加的讨论和平统一朝鲜问题的会议，要求撤退在朝鲜的外国军队，反对破坏朝鲜停战条款。
      （四）我们号召亚洲各国人民团结起来，反对和挫败东南亚条约组织之类的使亚洲人打亚洲人的一切拼凑侵略集团的计划和阴谋。要求结束外国对亚洲各地，包括西伊里安、果阿和马来亚在内的统治和干涉，从亚洲土地上撤出一切外国军事部队，取消在亚洲的一切外国军事基地。
    亲爱的朋友们！我们亚洲国家有十四亿以上人民，只要我们能够在和平共处五项原则的基础之上坚强地团结，我们的力量是无比壮大的。尽管殖民主义者仍然不断地以战争和奴役威胁我们，同时又以金元和“援助”勾引我们，我们是不会被吓倒和受欺骗的。我们坚信自己的力量。我们有世界其他各洲爱好和平的人民的支援。
    只要我们能够不断地增进我们的相互谅解，并加强我们的独立自由的生活，并充分地得到各自发展的机会，具有悠久历史和文化传统的亚洲各国人民，毫无疑问，将对确保世界和平和增进人类幸福的伟大事业，作出不愧于我们古人的新的重要贡献。
