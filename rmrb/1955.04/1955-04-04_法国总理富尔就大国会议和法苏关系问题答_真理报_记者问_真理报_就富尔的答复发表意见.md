Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 2nd: French Prime Minister Edgar Faure received "Pravda" reporters Zhukov and Rasakin. The questions asked by the reporters and the French Prime Minister's replies are as follows:

    Question: What is your attitude towards the statement made on March 27th by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, N.A. Bulganin, regarding the convening of a great power conference in order to resolve the task of easing international tensions?

    Answer: This statement is a very important and positive fact. I believe that the easing of international tensions depends primarily on the joint efforts of all the major powers concerned, while taking into account the legitimate security requirements of each of these countries. I hope that such negotiations will be held in this spirit - if such conditions are followed, the negotiations may be effective.

    The easing of tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States will promote such negotiations. In view of this, I am very pleased that Marshal Bulganin has responded favorably to President Eisenhower's recent statement.

    Question: In view of recent developments, would you like to express your opinion on the further development of Franco-Soviet relations?

    Answer: Recent developments have not changed my belief that nothing prevents the smooth development of Franco-Soviet relations. In fact, France has no other desire than to consolidate peace and security in Europe and throughout the world.

    I believe that the decisions that have just been voted on in Parliament, both in their spirit and in their content, are fully in line with France's obligations to the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom.

    On the other hand, I hope to expand economic and cultural relations between the two countries. In both of these areas, there has been significant progress recently. I am determined to promote the development of economic and cultural relations that are in the interest of both parties and that help to increase understanding between our two countries, which - however different - cannot forget everything that united them in the recent past.

    "Pravda" commented on the meeting:

    In answering the questions raised by the "Pravda" reporter, French Prime Minister Faure touched upon important international issues. However, his remarks cannot but raise some comments on the substance of the issues.

    Mr. Faure rightly pointed out that the easing of international tensions depends primarily on the joint efforts of all the major powers concerned, while taking into account the legitimate security requirements of each of these countries.

    However, as everyone knows, until now, the French government has preferred to adopt the strategy of concluding unilateral agreements by a group of countries against other countries, rather than "the joint efforts of all the major powers concerned."

    As everyone knows, the Faure government has been very enthusiastic in forcing the Senate of the Republic to approve the Paris Accords, which not only do not meet the "legitimate security requirements" of the countries bordering Germany - including France - but, on the contrary, undermine the security of these countries.

    Faure's current hope that the great power talks will be conducted in the spirit of "the joint efforts of all the major powers concerned, while taking into account the legitimate security requirements of each of these countries" is in itself to be welcomed.

    However, it must be taken into account that the realization of this wish depends to a large extent on France itself.

    Faure's reply to the second question of the "Pravda" reporter - which is even more self-contradictory - cannot but raise serious comments.

    On the one hand, Faure rightly pointed out that France and the Soviet Union "cannot forget everything that united them in the recent past," that is, during the period of the common struggle against Nazi Germany, and advocated the "smooth development of Franco-Soviet relations."

    But on the other hand, the French Prime Minister believes it is possible and can assert that the Paris Accords, which revive Hitler's "Wehrmacht," are "in line" with France's obligations to the Soviet Union, in other words, are in line with the 1944 Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance.

    As everyone knows, due to the Paris Accords, France is to become an ally of German militarism, while in the recent past, it was precisely the struggle against German militarism that united the Soviet Union and France. The Soviet Union cannot agree to use the Franco-Soviet Treaty as a smokescreen to help some French people cover up the truth that France's international position has changed, and to cover up their policy of remilitarizing West Germany in front of the public.

    Of course, no one will deny the importance of economic and cultural relations. This kind of relationship is necessary. But if empty talk about this issue is used to divert public attention from the main issues that are currently troubling everyone, it will harm the cause of peace.

    The Soviet Union has always attached great importance to the development and consolidation of Franco-Soviet relations, which are of concern to both France and the Soviet Union. But it is clear that the ratification and implementation of the Paris Accords will create a new situation in Europe that cannot but affect these relations.

    These are some of the comments that people naturally raise when reading the French Prime Minister's reply to the questions raised by the "Pravda" reporter.

    法国总理富尔就大国会议和法苏关系问题答“真理报”记者问
    “真理报”就富尔的答复发表意见
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科二日电：法国总理埃加·富尔接见了“真理报”记者茹科夫和拉萨金。记者所提的问题和法国总理的答复如下：
    问：你对三月二十七日发表的苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁关于召开一个大国会议以便解决缓和国际紧张局势的任务的声明抱什么态度？
    答：这个声明是一个很重要的、有积极意义的事实。我认为国际紧张局势的缓和主要取决于所有有关大国的共同努力，同时要考虑到这些国家中的每一个国家的正当的安全要求。我希望这种谈判本着这样的精神举行——如果遵照这样的条件，谈判就可能收到效果。
    苏联同美国之间的紧张局势的缓和，会促进这种谈判。有鉴于此，我很高兴，布尔加宁元帅对艾森豪威尔总统最近发表的声明有良好的反应。
    问：鉴于最近的事态发展，你愿意就法、苏关系的进一步发展表示意见吗？
    答：最近的事态发展并没有改变我这样的一个信念：没有什么东西妨碍法、苏关系顺利发展。事实上，法国除了巩固欧洲和全世界的和平和安全以外，别无其他愿望。
    我认为，在议会中刚刚表决过的决定，无论从它们的精神还是从它们的内容上来说，都是完全符合法国对苏联和英国承担的义务的。
    另一方面，我希望扩大两国间的经济关系和文化关系。在这两方面，最近有了显著的进展。我决心要促进符合于双方的利益和有助于增进我们两国间的谅解的经济关系和文化关系的发展，这两个国家——无论怎样不同——还是不能忘记在不久以前的过去使它们团结在一起的一切。
    “真理报”就这次接见发表意见说：
    法国总理富尔在回答“真理报”记者提出的问题时，接触到了重要的国际问题。但是他的谈话使人不能不提出一些关于问题的实质的意见。
    富尔先生十分正确地指出，国际紧张局势的缓和主要取决于所有有关大国的共同努力，同时要考虑到这些国家中的每一个国家的正当的安全要求。
    但是，大家都知道，直到目前为止，法国政府一直宁愿采取由一个国家集团缔结片面协定来反对其他国家的策略，而不愿“所有有关大国共同努力”。
    大家都知道，富尔政府非常热心地迫使共和国参议院批准巴黎协定，而巴黎协定却不仅不符合同德国接壤的国家——包括法国在内——的“正当的安全要求”，而且恰好相反，它们要破坏这些国家的安全。
    富尔目前希望大国会谈本着“所有有关大国的共同努力，同时要考虑到这些国家中的每一个国家的正当的安全要求”的精神来进行，这个愿望的本身是只能受到欢迎的。
    但是，必须考虑到这种愿望的实现在很大的程度上要取决于法国本身。
    富尔对“真理报”记者的第二个问题的答复——这个答复自相矛盾得更厉害——使人不能不提出严正的意见。
    一方面，富尔正确地指出，法国和苏联“不能忘记在不久以前的过去”，也就是在进行反对纳粹德国的共同斗争的时期，“使它们团结在一起的一切”，而且主张“法、苏关系顺利发展”。
    但是另一方面，法国总理认为可能而且可以断言复活希特勒“国防军”的巴黎协定是“符合”法国对苏联承担的义务的，换句话说，是符合一九四四年的法苏同盟互助条约的。
    大家都知道，由于巴黎协定，法国要成为德国军国主义的同盟者，而在不久以前的过去，正是反对德国军国主义的斗争使苏联同法国团结在一起的。苏联不能同意把法苏条约作为烟幕，来帮助某些法国人士在公众面前掩盖法国国际地位已经有所改变的真相，掩盖他们的使西德重新军国主义化的政策。
    当然没有人会否认经济关系和文化关系的重要意义。这种关系是必要的。但是如果用关于这个问题的空谈来转移公众对目前使每一个人不安的主要问题的注意，这就会损害和平事业。
    苏联始终是很重视对法、苏双方都有关的法、苏关系的发展和巩固的。但是很明显，巴黎协定的批准和实施会在欧洲形成一个不能不影响到这些关系的新局势。
    这就是人们在读法国总理对“真理报”记者所提问题的答复时自然要提出的一些意见。
