Shanxi Province's Mutual Aid and Cooperation Network
    Yu Ming

    In the winter of 1953 and the spring of 1954, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Shanxi Province experienced significant development. The number of agricultural production cooperatives across the province increased from over two thousand to over ten thousand, with more than 72% of townships having at least one agricultural cooperative. Simultaneously, over thirty million individual peasant households participated in various types of mutual aid teams.

    At this point, new problems emerged in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. First, there were many cooperatives but few cadres, and a lack of experience. Prior to this, because there were fewer cooperatives, and they were mostly in the trial stage, a method of assigning cadres from the county or district to each cooperative for comprehensive leadership was generally adopted. After the number of agricultural cooperatives grew to over ten thousand, there were not enough cadres to run them, and most county and district cadres lacked experience in running cooperatives. Second, county and district cadres, being busy leading the work of agricultural cooperatives, relaxed their leadership over mutual aid teams. If this problem were not resolved, it would not only affect the completion of the production increase task but would also inevitably affect the development and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives.

    Under these circumstances, in addition to transferring cadres and training cadres for running cooperatives and key members of agricultural cooperatives in batches, the Party committees at all levels more importantly universally established mutual aid and cooperation networks, adopting the leadership method of old cooperatives leading new cooperatives, cooperatives leading teams, and experienced cadres leading inexperienced cadres.

    The establishment of mutual aid and cooperation networks is generally based on the principles of voluntary participation and conditions such as similar production habits and appropriate distance, selecting an agricultural cooperative with a good foundation, strong leadership core, and prestige in the surrounding area as the center, connecting the surrounding agricultural cooperatives, and then each cooperative connecting the surrounding mutual aid teams and individual farmers. This solidifies the principle of advanced elements leading the less advanced in an organizational form.

    In 1954, the establishment of mutual aid and cooperation networks was widespread throughout the province. From the first half of the year alone, Changzhi Prefecture established 568 networks, with over 90% of cooperatives participating in the networks, connecting and driving over 3,400 mutual aid teams and vast numbers of individual farmers.

    The activities of mutual aid and cooperation networks are diverse. Each network has its own different contact methods and systems, but generally includes the following:

    One method is to determine the content of activities based on the needs of each cooperative and team, and organize regular and irregular experience exchange seminars or lectures according to the changing seasons. The issues to be resolved are sometimes first demonstrated in the central cooperative and then exchanged and taught. For example, the Yuanzhuang central cooperative in Lingchuan County had gained experience in dispelling the ideological concerns of new cooperative members and resolving issues such as the valuation of production materials for investment, and then convened a seminar with seven new cooperatives in the network, and these problems of the new cooperatives were successfully resolved. The Hubaozhuang mutual aid and cooperation network in Huguan County, with instructors from the central cooperative, taught ten new cooperatives the method of using smoked fertilizer. Within a month, the cooperatives smoked a total of 65,000 dan of fertilizer.

    Another method is for old cooperatives to visit new cooperatives, and new cooperatives to visit old cooperatives, for mutual exchange and learning. The cooperative affairs cadres of the Yaoshanggou central cooperative in Wuxiang divided their work to help new cooperatives, deciding to visit the new cooperatives once a month to impart experience, and the cadres of the new cooperatives often took the initiative to consult the old cooperatives. They called this method: "Old cooperatives take on apprentices, new cooperatives find masters."

    Another method is to organize members of new cooperatives, mutual aid team members, and individual farmers to visit old cooperatives and experienced cooperatives, and promptly promote more mature experiences. After the Hongjing central cooperative in Licheng County successfully tested the methods of smoked cave fertilizer and reclaimed wasteland fertilizer, it organized members of four new cooperatives to visit the site, and each cooperative then formulated a plan for accumulating wasteland fertilizer.

    Another method is to invite mutual aid teams to participate in relevant meetings of agricultural cooperatives, or for cooperative affairs cadres to divide their work and go deep into the mutual aid teams for specific assistance, in order to improve the leadership ability and production technology of the key members of the mutual aid teams. When the Dananping agricultural cooperative in Anze County formulated its production plan, it absorbed the participation of the mutual aid team leaders in the village. After the meeting, the head of the agricultural cooperative went deep into the mutual aid teams to help the mutual aid teams formulate the annual production plan.

    From the perspective of the role played by the mutual aid and cooperation network in the province in 1954, it was not limited to the exchange of production technology and experience in running cooperatives and teams, and many "networks" had developed into mutual economic assistance and support. Some mutually borrowed livestock and farm tools under the principle of voluntary participation and equal value; some mutually exchanged interlaced land on the border; and some jointly carried out agricultural infrastructure construction. The Taolili agricultural cooperative and the Taigucun agricultural cooperative in Yongji County once signed a contract, defining the method of mutual support for livestock, labor, and farm tools. When the newly built Nanzhuang agricultural cooperative in Wuxiang County was sowing cotton, it lacked technical personnel, so it reached an agreement with the Jianzhang old cooperative to obtain technical assistance from the Jianzhang old cooperative through a method of exchanging labor. For example, in order to exert collective strength to overcome natural disasters, the Yaoshanggou mutual aid and cooperation network organized 24 surrounding agricultural cooperatives to sign a disaster prevention and seedling protection contract, stipulating that if one cooperative suffered a disaster, 24 cooperatives would provide full support. Under the principle of voluntary participation and equal value, a total of 66 cooperatives and 17 mutual aid teams in some mutual aid and cooperation networks in Wuxiang County mutually exchanged interlaced land. Under the requirement of common development of production, many mutual aid and cooperation networks jointly carried out agricultural infrastructure construction within the network. For example, there was a 50-mu sandy beach in Yugou Village, Wuxiang, which the villagers could not turn into fertile land in the past. Last year, through the activities of the mutual aid and cooperation network, the agricultural cooperative led the mutual aid teams in the village to realize this ideal. Last year, during the spring plowing and sowing, the Dongzhang central cooperative in Pingshun County found that the Longzhen agricultural cooperative was short of five dou of Golden Queen corn seeds, so it transferred the surplus from its own cooperative to this cooperative, ensuring that the cooperative was able to sow in a timely manner. When Liang Rujin and other two mutual aid teams in Zhima Jiaoliang, Wuxiang County, were about to sow, they were still short of a large portion of fertilizer, so the agricultural cooperative took the initiative to lend them 150 jin of fertilizer. According to statistics from Wuxiang County, during the spring plowing and sowing period, there were 1,487 such contacts, totaling 5,620 yuan.

    In addition to paying attention to the leadership of each mutual aid and cooperation network, the counties also attached great importance to the connection between "networks." The connection between "networks" in Wuxiang County adopted three methods: First, the county's leading organs spread the experience of the county's mutual aid and cooperation network through small newspapers or by issuing circulars, so that the "networks" in the county could communicate with each other; second, they organized the responsible cadres and cooperative affairs cadres of each network to visit advanced agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams, and then introduced them to everyone through the network. Third, the county and district held mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings to summarize and exchange experiences with each other. Through these three methods, close connections were made between the "networks," which ensured that various advanced experiences could be promptly promoted on a larger scale. For example, during the busy farming season when weeding and wheat harvesting were carried out in a cross-cutting manner last year, many agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams encountered difficulties in organizing and using labor. Later, after the mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings in various districts introduced the "small contract work" experience of the Jianzhang agricultural cooperative, the labor organization of these agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams was improved.

    Mutual aid and cooperation networks are not only applicable in areas with few agricultural cooperatives, but also fully applicable in areas that have been cooperativized. Because it is a leadership method of advanced elements leading the less advanced, even if a township is fully cooperativized, the work between cooperatives will never be completely balanced, and there will always be advanced and backward elements. Therefore, this method must still be used to achieve the goal of common progress. With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the improvement of the degree of cooperativization, the new leadership method of mutual aid and cooperation networks should be vigorously promoted and applied, and should be gradually enriched in practice to make it more perfect.

    This year, the number of agricultural cooperatives in Shanxi Province has increased from more than 10,000 to more than 30,000, and the number of farmer households joining the cooperatives has reached more than 40% of the province's total farmer households. At the same time, there are still a considerable number of mutual aid teams. The mutual aid and cooperation networks established last year can no longer fully adapt to the current situation. There are many problems that must be solved: for example, due to the increase in the number of cooperatives, the scope of the network is too large, making leadership inconvenient; some networks have been left unattended for a long time and have become a mere formality; some have regarded the mutual aid and cooperation network as an administrative organization, and everything is arranged and communicated within the network, causing cooperative affairs cadres and cooperative members, mutual aid team leaders and team members to lose too much work time; and some are townships that did not have agricultural cooperatives in the past, but now have them, and need to establish networks immediately. In addition, the central cooperatives of the mutual aid and cooperation networks in various places also have many shortcomings: such as some central cooperatives lacking experience and prestige; some central cooperative leaders being afraid of losing work time and finding it troublesome; some central cooperatives regarding themselves as leaders, rigidly promoting their own experience, or asking other agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams to give themselves unnecessary "work reports," causing dissatisfaction among the cooperatives and teams in the network; and some central cooperatives being located in unsuitable locations, having too wide a contact range, and having little effect. These shortcomings have weakened the role of the central cooperative to varying degrees.

    In December 1954, the Changzhi Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China trained the heads of the central cooperatives of the mutual aid and cooperation networks in various counties, inspected and rectified the mutual aid and cooperation networks, and discussed the nature and tasks of the central cooperative. Everyone believed that the central cooperative must be a more advanced agricultural cooperative, and all its work should be at the forefront, and it should have a fraternal relationship with the general cooperatives; its task is mainly to help the agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams in the network solve problems. In order to overcome the shortcomings of the central cooperative being located in an unsuitable location, having too wide a contact range, and making leadership inconvenient, it was decided that the mutual aid and cooperation network should be established basically on a township basis. Practice thrift and oppose waste in basic construction!

    山西省的互助合作网
    禹明
    一九五三年冬和一九五四年春，山西省的互助合作运动有了很大的发展。全省农业生产合作社由两千多个发展到一万多个，百分之七十二的乡都有了一个以上的农业社；同时，还有三千多万户个体农民参加了各种类型的互助组。
    这时，互助合作运动中就出现了新的问题。第一是社多，干部少，经验不足。在此以前，因为社较少，又大部处于试办阶段，一般都采用了一社驻一县干部或区干部的包干领导方法。农业社发展到一万多个以后，办社干部就不够用了，而且大部分县、区干部没有办社经验。其次是县、区干部因忙于领导农业社的工作，对互助组的领导放松了。这个问题如不解决，不仅影响增产任务的完成，而且也必然要影响农业社的发展和巩固。
    在此情况下，各级党委除抽调和分批训练了办社干部和农业社的骨干外，更重要的是普遍建立了互助合作网，采用了老社带新社，社带组，有经验的干部带没经验的干部的领导方法。
    互助合作网的建立，一般都是根据自愿原则和生产习惯相类似、距离远近适中等条件，选择基础较好，有坚强的领导骨干，在周围有威信的农业社为中心，把周围农业社联系起来，再以各个社联系周围的互助组和单干农民。这样就把先进带动落后的原则用一种组织形式固定下来了。
    一九五四年，互助合作网的建立，在全省是普遍的。只从前半年了解，长治专区就建立了五百六十八个网，百分之九十以上的社都参加了网，并联系和带动着三千四百多个互助组和广大的单干农民。
    互助合作网的活动方式是很多的。各个网内有各自不同的联系办法和制度，但大致有如下几种：
    一种是随着生产季节的变化，根据各个社和组的需要，确定活动的内容，组织定期的和不定期的经验交流座谈会或传授会。所要解决的问题，有的是先在中心社内做出榜样，然后进行交流传授。如陵川县原庄中心社，在解除新社员思想顾虑、解决生产资料投资作价等问题方面，都有了经验，便召集了网内的七个新社进行了座谈，新社的这些问题都顺利地得到了解决。壶关县郭堡庄的互助合作网，由中心社的传授员把熏肥办法传授给十个新社，一个月内各社一共熏肥六万五千担。
    一种是老社来，新社去，相互交流，相互学习。武乡窑上沟中心社的社务干部分工包干帮助新社，决定每月到新社传授经验一次，新社的干部也常常主动地去找老社请教。他们叫这种办法是：“老社带徒弟，新社找师傅”。
    一种是组织新社的社员和互助组组员及单干农民到老社和有经验的社去参观访问，及时地推广比较成熟的经验。黎城县洪井中心社试验熏洞肥、揭荒肥的办法成功后，组织了四个新社的社员到现场参观，各社随即订出了积荒肥的计划。
    一种是邀请互助组参加农业社的有关会议，或者社务干部分工包干深入到互助组进行具体帮助，以提高互助组骨干的领导能力和生产技术。安泽县大南坪农业社在订生产计划时，曾吸收村里的互助组长参加，会后农业社社长又深入到互助组帮助互助组订出了全年生产计划。
    从全省一九五四年互助合作网所起的作用上看，不仅仅限于生产技术和办社、办组经验的交流，而且许多“网”内已发展到经济上的相互帮助和支援。有的在自愿和等价的原则下，牲口和农具互相借用；有的互相调换了边界上的插花地；也有的联合进行农业基本建设。永济县桃李村农业社和太古屯农业社，曾经订立合同，确定了互相支援牲口、劳力和农具办法。武乡南庄新建农业社在播种棉花时，由于缺乏技术人材，就和监漳老社取得协议，用变工办法，得到监漳老社的技术援助。又如窑上沟互助合作网，为了发挥集体力量战胜自然灾害，组织周围二十四个农业社签订了防灾保苗合同，规定一社受灾二十四社全力支援。在自愿等价的原则下，武乡县的一些互助合作网内共有六十六社、十七个互助组互相调换了插花地。在共同发展生产的要求下，许多互助合作网在网内联合进行了农业基本建设。如武乡雨沟村有五十亩大的一片沙滩地，过去村民想修成良田办不到，去年通过互助合作网的活动，农业社带动全村互助组，把这个理想实现了。去年春耕下种时，平顺县东漳中心社发现龙镇农业社缺少五斗金皇后玉米种籽，就把本社多余的调剂给这个社，保证了这个社适时下种。武乡县芝麻角梁如金等两个互助组临播种时还缺一大部分肥料，农业社就主动借给他们一百五十斤肥田粉。据武乡全县统计，在春耕下种期间，这种联系就有一千四百八十七次，总值达五千六百二十元。
    各县除注意对各个互助合作网的领导外，还十分重视了“网”和“网”之间的联系。武乡县“网”和“网”之间的联系，采取了三种办法：一是由县的领导机关通过小报或用发通报等办法来传播全县互助合作网的经验，使全县的“网”互相通气；二是组织各个网的负责干部和办社干部，到先进农业社和互助组参观访问，然后通过网向大家介绍。三是由县区召开互助合作代表会议，互相总结和交流经验。通过这三种办法，使“网”和“网”之间取得了密切的联系，这就保证了各种先进经验能够在更大范围内及时推广。如在去年锄苗、割麦交义进行的农忙季节，许多农业社和互助组在组织和使用劳力上发生了困难，后来经过各区的互助合作代表会议，介绍了监漳农业社的“小包工”经验，这些农业社和互助组的劳动组织都有了改进。
    互助合作网不仅在农业社少的地区适用，而且在合作化了的地区也是完全适用的。因为它既是一种以先进带动落后的领导方法，即使一个乡全部合作化了，但社和社之间的工作也绝不会是完全平衡的，总还会有先进的和落后的，因此，还必须利用这种办法来达到共同前进的目的。随着互助合作运动的发展，合作化程度的提高，更应该大力推广和运用互助合作网这种新的领导方法，并应在实践中逐步加以充实，使其更加完善。
    今年山西省的农业社已由一万多个发展到三万多个，入社农户已达到全省总农户的百分之四十多。同时互助组也还有相当的数量。去年建立起来的互助合作网已不能完全适应目前的形势了。有许多问题必须加以解决：例如由于社的增多，网的范围太大，领导起来不方便；有的网长期无人领导，流于形式；也有的把互助合作网当成一种行政组织，什么事情也在网内布置传达，致使社务干部和社员、互助组组长和组员误工太多；还有的是过去没有农业社的乡，现在有了，需要立即建网等。另外，各地互助合作网的中心社本身也存在着许多缺点：如有的中心社因经验不足，威信不高；有的中心社长怕误工、嫌麻烦；有的中心社以领导者自居，硬性推广自己的经验，或者让其它农业社和互助组给自己作不必要的“工作汇报”，引起网内社和组的不满；还有的中心社，位置不适中，联系太宽，作用不大等。这些缺点，都在不同程度上削弱了中心社的作用。
      一九五四年十二月，中共长治地委集训了各县互助合作网的中心社社长，检查和整顿了互助合作网；讨论了中心社的性质和任务。大家认为中心社必须是较先进的农业社，各种工作应走在前头，和一般社应是兄弟关系；它的任务主要是帮助网内农业社和互助组解决问题。为了克服中心社位置不适中，联系过宽、领导不便的缺点，确定互助合作网基本上以乡为单位建立。厉行节约，反对基本建设中的浪费！
