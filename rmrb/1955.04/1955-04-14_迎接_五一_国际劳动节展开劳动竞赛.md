To greet the "May First" International Labor Day, the workers of the Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company are launching a fervent labor competition. The open-hearth furnace section produced 63 instances of rapid steelmaking from April 1st to 11th, exceeding the total number of rapid steelmaking instances in January and February of last year. The workers of the No. 5 open-hearth furnace, who rarely produced rapid steelmaking in the past, improved their operating methods and also produced 19 consecutive instances of rapid steelmaking, setting a new record of shortening the smelting time of a furnace of steel by four minutes compared to the highest record in the history of the steelmaking plant. Due to the closer coordination between the ingot casting, raw material sections, and the open-hearth furnace section, the production rate of steel types produced according to plan from the 1st to the 11th also exceeded the state plan target by 7 percent.

The workers of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 have achieved new accomplishments in the labor competition to greet "May First." From April 1st to 8th, the two open-hearth furnaces have produced 117 tons of steel more than originally planned. The No. 1 open-hearth furnace of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 was originally planned to be repaired after smelting 320 furnaces of steel, but the workers implemented operating procedures during the production process and strengthened the maintenance of the furnace. By 4:15 p.m. on the 9th, it had already smelted 382 furnaces of steel, and the furnace was still in good condition. The workers in this workshop are carrying out a furnace protection competition, striving for a new record of reaching 400 furnaces of furnace life to greet the "May First" Labor Day. In order to greet the Red May, the Class C workers of the Second Rolling Mill Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 2 created a new record of rolling square steel exceeding the plan by 13.76 percent. In early April, all workshops, sections, and groups of the New Shanghai Steel Plant launched a labor competition.

To greet the "May First" International Labor Day, the workers of the third shift of the Rolling Mill Workshop of Daye Steel Plant challenged the factories and mines in Huangshi City to launch a labor competition. On the evening of the 5th, the workers of the third shift, in response to the problems existing in the first quarter of production, put forward four conditions to ensure the completion of the April plan, and proposed to implement the "frequent but small additions" of coal burning method, striving to burn 30 to 50 catties less coal per day; to implement uniform steel feeding, eliminate recycled steel, reduce the consumption of coal and steel billets, and ensure a 1 percent reduction in costs. From the 1st to the 9th, the output of the third shift workers completed 111.9 percent, and the preliminary inspection showed that the product quality was completely qualified.

    迎接“五一”国际劳动节展开劳动竞赛
    鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂的职工们，正以热烈的劳动竞赛来迎接“五一”国际劳动节。平炉工段从四月一日到十一日就出了六十三次快速炼钢，比去年一、二两个月的快速炼钢次数还多。过去很少出快速炼钢的五号平炉工人们，改进了操作方法，也连续出了十九次快速炼钢，并创造了一炉钢水的冶炼时间比炼钢厂历史上最高纪录缩短四分钟的新纪录。由于铸锭、原料工段和平炉工段配合更加密切，因此，从一日到十一日按计划钢种生产的生产率，也超过国家计划指标百分之七。
    上海钢铁一厂工人在迎接“五一”的劳动竞赛中，取得了新的成就。从四月一日到八日，两座平炉已比原订计划多炼了一百十七吨钢。上海钢铁三厂一号平炉原计划炼三百二十炉钢就要修炉，但工人们在生产过程中贯彻了操作规程，加强了炉子的维护保养工作，到九日下午四时十五分，已炼出了三百八十二炉钢，炉子还很好。这个车间的工人正在开展护炉竞赛，争取炉龄达到四百炉的新纪录，来迎接“五一”劳动节。上海钢铁二厂第二轧钢车间丙班工人为迎接红五月，就创造了轧制方钢超过计划百分之十三点七六的新纪录。新沪钢铁厂各车间、工段和小组，在四月初就展开了劳动竞赛。
    大冶钢厂轧钢车间第三班工人为迎接“五一”国际劳动节，向黄石市各厂矿挑战，展开劳动竞赛。五日晚，第三班工人针对第一季度生产中存在的问题，提出了保证完成四月份计划的四项条件，并提出要实行“勤加少加”的烧煤方法，争取每天少烧煤三十斤到五十斤；实行均匀送钢，消灭回炉钢，减少煤炭、钢坯的消耗，保证降低成本百分之一。第三班工人从一日到九日，产量完成了百分之一一一点九，初步检查产品质量完全合格。
