Serving in the Military is a Glorious Obligation of Citizens

	“I will definitely wait for you!”

	When He Ping Village in Jingtai County, Gansu Province, was carrying out the work of enlisting new soldiers, Zeng Yulan, a female member of the Communist Youth League, saw that her fiancé, Liu Zhengwen (also a member of the Youth League), was not in good spirits, so she went to find him.

	"Serving in the army to defend the motherland is a glorious thing. You said a few days ago that you would take the lead in signing up. Now it seems like you still have something on your mind!" she asked Liu Zhengwen. Liu Zhengwen said: "Everyone knows that joining the army is glorious, it's just that when I mobilized my mother, I saw that she still had some concerns."

	"What are her concerns?" Zeng Yulan asked anxiously. Liu Zhengwen thought for a while before saying: "She's worried that after I leave, I won't be able to find a good wife like you." Both of them laughed.

	Then, the two talked for a while, and finally Zeng Yulan said: "If you sign up for the army this time, I will definitely wait for you, whether it's three or five years."

	After Liu Zhengwen's mother was persuaded and mobilized by Liu Zhengwen, she agreed to her son's application, but she was always thinking in her heart whether Yulan would wait for Zhengwen to come back after her son joined the army? After Yulan learned about her mother-in-law's concerns, she ran to her fiancé's home. She told her mother-in-law how important it was to implement the compulsory military service system, how glorious military dependents were, and so on.

	The mother-in-law said: "I know it's glorious for Zhengwen to join the army, but there will be fewer people working in the future, and the work at home will be too much to handle."

	"Mom, I'll do the work at home after he leaves." Yulan said this the loudest.

	"Besides, you are not too young, and he will be in the army for several years."

	Yulan understood her mother-in-law's concerns and rushed to say: "Mom, don't worry, it's a glorious thing for him to join the army to defend our good life. No matter if it's three or five years, I will definitely wait for him."

	The mother-in-law looked at her clever, soon-to-be daughter-in-law and felt happy in her heart. Finally, she nodded and said: "It's glorious for him to join the army, and you know that I am also a reasonable person!" Liu Zhengwen signed up.

	Grandma He Mobilizes Her Son and Son-in-Law

	He Dama, chairman of the Women's Federation of Shidai Village in Andong City, Liaoning Province, had her eldest son demobilized from the army in 1954. When the work of enlisting new soldiers began, she calculated that her second son, Guichen, was 19 years old this year, which was the age for conscription, and her son-in-law, Liu Changyi, was 21 years old, which was also qualified. She was determined to mobilize them to enlist in the army. However, Guichen always didn't want to leave his mother, and his daughter Kuilan didn't really agree to her son-in-law serving in the military either.

	After He Dama learned about these thoughts, she said to her son Guichen: "Think about it, can there be a home without a country? In order to defend our own good life and the good life of the people across the country, young people must actively join the army. This is a glorious thing." She also said to her daughter: "Your husband is going to be a soldier, you must not hold him back! It's also glorious for a wife whose husband serves the country!"

	Her son Guichen and son-in-law Liu Changyi both signed up after her mobilization. She also repeatedly educated her son and son-in-law to study hard after joining the army, improve their skills, and defend the motherland.

	If the Older Brother Passes, the Older Brother Goes

	Hu Baoxiang and Hu Baoshun, two brothers from Pingluobao District in the suburbs of Shenyang City, both voluntarily signed up for conscription. When they were having their physical examination at the conscription station, Hu Baoshun confidently said to his brother:

	"My education is higher than yours, they will definitely approve me to join the army."

	"That's not necessarily true!" Although Hu Baoxiang said this, he wasn't sure in his heart. He thought: My younger brother is a graduate of junior high school, and his education is higher than mine.

	Hu Baoshun was really full of confidence, waiting for the good news of being approved to serve in the military. But Hu Baoxiang was always thinking: "Will I really fail the examination?" He always ran to the village to inquire whether the enlistment notice had arrived. The enlistment notice finally came, and he was really approved to join the army. Hu Baoxiang was extremely happy.

	The next day, his younger brother learned from the village that he had not passed the examination and really felt surprised. He excitedly said to his brother:

	"Why didn't I pass the examination? I have to ask about it."

	"What's there to ask? Your health isn't as good as mine!"

	Hu Baoxiang told his brother many reasons, saying that for the sake of the motherland, he should obey the country's arrangements. Having education in the countryside can help learn agricultural technology, which has many benefits for improving agricultural technology and using new agricultural tools. This is supporting the People's Liberation Army. Hu Baoshun felt that his brother's words made sense, and plus the conscription station had already made the final decision, so he said:

	"Okay, it is most glorious to respond to the country's call to serve in the military. You go to the army and do a good job, and I will guarantee to work hard in production in the cooperative!"

	Li Xiaoxiang's Wish Came True

	Li Xiaoxiang is nineteen years old this year and is from Yuankou Township, Yongming County, Hunan Province. He has no parents and has been helping landlords look after cattle since he was a child. Not long after liberation, the People's Liberation Army came to his hometown to suppress bandits and protect the safety of people's lives and property. He saw that the People's Liberation Army was very good to the people, and the people also loved the People's Liberation Army very much. At that time, he was only fourteen years old, and he decided that when he grew up, he would definitely become a soldier of the People's Liberation Army. In the winter of 1950, he volunteered to join the army but failed because he was too short. In 1951, he mustered up the courage to sign up again but failed the examination again. He was really sad at the time. In the winter of 1953, he joined the militia team. The responsible comrades of the county's armed forces department told them: "You young lads, as long as you strengthen your training, you will have the opportunity to join the People's Liberation Army in the future." From then on, he actively engaged in production at home while strengthening his physical training. In late February of this year, the township launched the work of enlisting new soldiers, and he was extremely happy. At the township's mass meeting, he signed up. He was approved to join the army. When he received the glorious red cloth strip and a big red flower, he was truly happy. He said: "My wish has finally come true, and I will definitely train myself to become an outstanding national defense fighter."

    服兵役是公民的光荣义务
    “我一定等着你！”
    甘肃景泰县和平村进行征集补充兵员工作时，女青年团员曾玉兰，看到自己的未婚夫刘正文（也是青年团员）情绪不大好，于是她就去找他。
    “参军保卫祖国是光荣事情，你前两天还说要带头报名哩，现在看你好像还有啥心事！”她问刘正文。刘正文说：“参军光荣谁还不知道，就是动员我妈时，我看她还有顾虑。”
      “她有啥顾虑？”曾玉兰急忙问。刘正文思量了一会才说：“她顾虑我走了以后，再找不上你这样的好媳妇。”说着两人都笑了。
    接着，两人又谈论了一阵子，最后曾玉兰说：“你这次报名参了军，不管三、五年，我一定等着你。”
    刘正文的母亲经过刘正文的说服动员以后，同意儿子去应征，可是心里总想着儿子参军以后，玉兰是不是能等着正文回来呢？玉兰知道了婆婆的心事以后，她就跑到婆家去。她给婆婆讲实行义务兵役制是如何重要、军属多么光荣等等。
    婆婆说：“正文去当兵我也知道光荣，就是以后劳动的人少了，家里的活忙不过来。”
    “妈，他走了，家里的活我做。”玉兰这一声说的最响亮。
    “再说，你年纪也不小了，他当兵要几年哩。”
    玉兰明白婆婆的心事，抢着说：“妈，你不要担心了，他参军保卫咱们过好日子，这是光荣的事，不管三年、五年，我一定等着他。”
    婆婆看着未过门的聪明的媳妇，心里一阵高兴，最后她点点头说：“他当兵是光荣的，你知道我也是明事理的人呀！”刘正文去报了名。
    何大娘动员儿子和女婿
    辽宁安东市石岱村妇联主任何大娘的大儿子一九五四年才从部队复员回来。征集补充兵员工作开始时，她算计，二儿子贵臣今年十九岁正是应征年龄，女婿刘长义二十一岁也正合格，她下决心要动员他俩去应征入伍。可是，贵臣这孩子总舍不得离开妈妈，女儿奎兰也不大同意女婿去服兵役。
    何大娘知道这些思想以后，她就跟儿子贵臣说：“你想想，没有国能有家吗。为了保卫咱们自己和全国人民的好日子，青年人就要积极参军，这是光荣的事情。”她又跟女儿说：“女婿要去当兵，你可不要扯腿呀！丈夫当兵卫国，妻子也光荣呵！”
    儿子贵臣和女婿刘长义经过她的动员都报名了。她还一再地教育儿子和女婿入伍后要好好学习，提高本领，保卫祖国。
    哥哥合格哥哥去
    沈阳市郊平罗堡分区胡宝祥和胡宝顺兄弟二人都自动报名应征了。在征集站检查身体的时候，胡宝顺满有把握地向他哥哥说：
      “我的文化比你高，非批准我入伍不可。”
      “那也不一定！”胡宝祥虽然嘴这样说，心中可不摸底，他想：弟弟是高小毕业生，文化就是比自己高。
    胡宝顺真是充满信心，等着批准让他服兵役的喜讯。可是胡宝祥老是想：“是不是真检查不上？”他一天总往村上跑，打听是不是来了入伍通知。入伍通知终于来了，真的批准他入伍了。胡宝祥高兴的不得了。
    第二天，他弟弟从村上知道自己没有检查上，确实觉得突然，他激动地向他哥哥说：
    “为什么我没有检查上？我得问问去。”
    “还问啥。你身体不如我呀！”
    胡宝祥对弟弟讲了许多道理，说为了祖国就要听从祖国分配。有文化在农村可以学农业技术，对改进农业技术、使用新农具有许多好处。这就是支援人民解放军。胡宝顺听了哥哥的话也觉着有理，再加上征集站已经最后决定了，于是他说：
    “好吧，响应国家号召服兵役是最光荣的，你到部队好好干，我在社里保证努力生产！”
    李孝祥的愿望实现了
    李孝祥今年十九岁，是湖南永明县源口乡人。他无爹无娘，从小就帮地主看牛。解放不久，解放军到他们家乡剿匪，保卫人民生命财产的安全，他看到解放军对人民非常好，人民也非常爱护解放军。当时他还只十四岁，他就决定将来长大了，一定当个人民解放军的战士。一九五○年冬天，他自愿参军，因为身体矮小不合格。一九五一年，他又鼓足勇气去报名，又没有验上，当时他心里真难过。一九五三年冬天，他参加了民兵队，县里的武装部的负责同志对他们说：“你们青年小伙子，只要加强锻炼，将来是有机会参加人民解放军的。”从那以后，他就在家一边积极生产，一边加强锻炼身体。今年二月下旬，乡里开展了征集补充兵员工作，他高兴极了，在全乡群众大会上，他报了名。他被批准入伍了。当他接到应征光荣的红布条和一朵大红花时，他真是高兴，他说：“我的愿望终于实现了，我一定要把自己锻炼成为一个优秀的国防战士。”
