To the Editor:

In the Miaoling Mountains of Leishan County, Guizhou Province, there is a high mountain canyon area called Gaoyan Township. In this primeval forest resembling a vast ocean, 177 hardworking and brave Miao families reside.

Here, clouds and mist swirl year-round, and it often rains, obscuring the sun. Here, there are waterfalls that stretch for dozens of yards, resembling ten thousand galloping horses, constantly cascading down from the high mountains.

In this area, the Miao farmers, for their own survival, have opened up their homes with their strong hands and cultivated 5,116 "tiao" of land - these are the terraced fields of Gaoyan Township, scattered throughout the forest.

Like many other remote mountain villages in the motherland, during the Kuomintang rule, the farmers' hard work year-round only resulted in the payment of heavy taxes and levies. They were often in a state of "using ash water as salt and firewood as blankets." Farmers couldn't afford farm tools and fertilizers, the production methods were very backward, and the growth and maturity of crops were very slow. For example, in Jiaola Natural Village of Gaoyan Township, rice seeds were soaked and seedlings were sown starting in February each year, and it took three months for the seedlings to grow large enough to be transplanted; the autumn harvest began in mid-September and ended in late November, lasting for two and a half months, during which the rice was often crushed by frost and snow in the fields.

After liberation, the sun shone into the deep mountain canyons. Gaoyan, like thousands upon thousands of villages in the motherland, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, carried out land reform. To help farmers solve their production and living difficulties, the government has distributed 910 pieces of free agricultural implements, 458 sets of winter clothing, and countless interest-free and low-interest loans, relief funds, and relief grain over the past few years. By the end of 1954, 128 households in Gaoyan Township had been organized, accounting for 90.7% of the households that should be organized; among them, 16 mutual aid teams (totaling 103 households) had implemented a work-point system.

Because the Party and the People's Government implemented a policy of rewarding production and promoted the farmers' enthusiasm for production, and with the development of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, some changes have taken place in the past backward production techniques and farming habits, and the rice yield in Gaoyan Township has increased year after year. For example, in 1953, the township only harvested 5,430 "tiao" of rice, but in 1954, it harvested 5,668 "tiao", an increase of more than 4% compared to 1953, and an increase of more than 15.3% compared to the normal yield. The autumn harvest was also completed a month and a half earlier, eliminating the phenomenon of "planting but not harvesting." In the past, farmers always believed that "our mountains are high and the water is cold, only rice is produced here, and nothing else can ripen"; in 1954, many farmers in Gaoyan Township planted corn and sweet potatoes under the advocacy of the Party. At the time of the autumn harvest, in addition to rice, every family harvested a lot of corn and sweet potatoes.

With the improvement of production, the lives of farmers in Gaoyan Township have also undergone significant changes. Taking Jiaola Natural Village as an example, in the past, the entire village of 25 households and 134 people only bought 50 "zhang" and 5 "chi" of native cloth a year, averaging about 3.8 "chi" per person; the entire village had only 2 cotton quilts and 4 plows and harrows (owned by a landlord and a rich peasant); and ate 94 "jin" and 10 "liang" of salt a year, averaging 11 "liang" per person. After liberation, in the year from the second half of 1953 to the first half of 1954, the whole village bought 35 "zhang" of wide cloth and 25 "zhang" and 5 "chi" of native cloth, which together is 105 "zhang" and 5 "chi" of native cloth, an average of 7.8 "chi" per person, an increase of more than double; the whole village has 23 cotton quilts and 23 plows and harrows each; and ate a total of 676 "jin" of salt a year, an average of more than 5 "jin" per person.

In 1954, when the unified purchase and sale of grain was implemented, the farmers of Gaoyan Township voluntarily sold 21,395 "jin" of surplus grain to the state.

Editor, you can see that the Gaoyan farmers, living in the remote mountains and canyons of the southwest of the motherland, like farmers in other parts of the country, are taking firm steps, following the Party's general line in the transition period, and advancing together with the torrent of mutual aid and cooperation towards the socialist road!

### 高山峡谷里的变化

    高山峡谷里的变化编辑同志：
    贵州雷山县境苗岭山脉中有一个名高岩乡的高山峡谷地带，这一片像茫茫大海的原始森林里，居住着一百七十七户勤劳勇敢的苗族农民。
    这里，常年飞云腾雾，阴雨绵绵，常常看不见太阳；这里，有着像万马奔腾似的长达数十丈的瀑布，不断地从高山上倾泻下来。
    就在这片地方，苗族农民们为了自己的生存，用自己坚强的两手，开辟了自己的家园，开垦了五千一百一十六挑土地——这就是散处在森林当中的高岩乡的梯田。
    高岩，像祖国的其他许多偏僻山村一样，在国民党统治时代，农民终年辛勤劳动所得，除了缴纳重重苛捐杂税而外，常年处在“灰水当食盐，柴火当被盖”的境地。农民们买不起农具和肥料，生产方式非常落后，庄稼的生长和成熟都很缓慢，如高岩乡的交腊自然村，每年从二月就开始泡谷种撒秧，三个月秧子才长大移植；秋收从九月中旬开始到十一月下旬才结束，前后两个半月长的时间，稻谷常被霜雪压烂在田里。
    解放后，太阳照进了深山峡谷。高岩也和祖国千千万万个乡村一样在党和人民政府的领导下，进行了土地改革。为了帮助农民解决生产和生活上的困难，几年来，政府发放了无偿农具九百一十件，寒衣四百五十八套，各种无息、低息的贷款和救济款、救济粮不计其数。到一九五四年底，高岩乡已组织起来的农户有一百二十八户，占应组织起来农户的百分之九十点七；其中有十六个互助组（共一百零三户）已实行评工计分制度。
    由于党和人民政府贯彻执行了奖励生产的政策，发扬了农民的生产积极性，随着农业互助合作的发展，过去落后的生产技术和耕作习惯有了一些改变，高岩乡水稻的产量也连年提高了。如一九五三年全乡只收到稻谷五千四百三十挑，一九五四年就收到五千六百六十八挑，比一九五三年增产百分之四强，比常年产量增加了百分之十五点三强。秋收也提前一个半月结束，消除了
  “只种不收”的现象。过去，农民一贯认为“我们这里山高水冷，只产大米，其余什么也长不熟”；一九五四年，高岩乡很多农民在党的倡导下都种了苞谷、红苕。秋收时，除了稻谷以外，家家都收了很多苞谷、红苕。
    随着生产的改进，高岩乡农民的生活也起了显著的变化。以交腊自然村为例，过去，全寨二十五户一百三十四人，一年只买五十丈零五尺土布，每人平均约合三尺八寸；全寨只有棉被二床、犁耙四套（是一户地主、一户富农的）；一年吃盐九十四斤零十两，每人平均吃十一两。解放后，一九五三年下半年到一九五四年上半年的一年中，全寨买了宽布三十五丈、土布二十五丈零五尺，折成土布一起是一百零五丈五尺，每人平均七尺八寸，增加了一倍多；全寨有棉被二十三床、犁耙各二十三套；一年共吃盐六百七十六斤，每人平均吃五斤多。
    一九五四年，粮食实行统购统销时，高岩乡的农民自动地卖出了二万一千三百九十五斤余粮给国家。
    编辑同志，你可以看到：生活在祖国西南偏僻的深山峡谷里的高岩农民，同全国其他各地的农民一样，正迈着坚定的步伐，遵循着党在过渡时期的总路线，随着互助合作的洪流，一道向社会主义的大道前进！　　侯正云
