    More than one hundred construction sites in Beijing have successively commenced work. The construction area of these projects exceeds 1.3 million square meters. Next to the newly built state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, construction of the state-owned Beijing No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory began in 1955. Construction workers are already breaking ground at the opening and cleaning workshop site of this future factory. Workers are laying pebbles on the ground of a North China Directly Subordinate Metal Structure Factory plant, which produces building materials such as steel trusses and steel columns, preparing to pour concrete and asphalt flooring. This factory is expected to go into production in late June.

    This year, Beijing will also build more than twenty universities and colleges, worker-peasant rapid middle schools, more than thirty middle and primary schools, as well as various vocational schools and cadre schools' buildings. Many classrooms and dormitory buildings have successively commenced construction. A six-story building under construction at the Beijing Iron and Steel Institute is already undergoing interior work. By early June, this new building will be able to accommodate more than two thousand teachers and students for office work, study, and experiments. In addition, hospitals, sanatoriums, and other public buildings will be constructed this year in areas with beautiful scenery and large populations. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    北京市一百多个建筑工地陆续开工
    北京市已有一百多个建筑工地陆续开工。这些工程的建筑面积，有一百三十多万平方公尺。在新建国营北京第二棉纺织厂的旁边，一九五五年又开始了国营北京第三棉纺织厂的建设，建筑工人已在这座未来工厂的清花车间工地上刨土。工人们正在一座生产钢房架、钢柱等建筑器材的华北直属金属结构工厂厂房的地面上铺石子，准备浇灌混凝土、沥青地面。这座工厂预计在六月下旬就可以投入生产。
    今年，北京市还将兴建二十多所高等学校、工农速成中学，三十多所中、小学以及各种专业学校和干部学校的校舍。有许多教室和宿舍楼房已陆续开工。北京钢铁工业学院正在建筑中的一座六层大楼已在进行室内作业，到六月初，这座新楼就可容纳两千多个教师和学生来办公、学习和实验。此外，在风景优美和人口较多的地区，今年将建筑医院、疗养院等公共建筑物。（据新华社讯）
