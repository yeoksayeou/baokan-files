    The 1954 flood control work, thanks to the strong leadership of local Party committees and governments, the arduous efforts of local people, the vigorous support of the people of the whole country, and the role played by the flood control projects built over the years, enabled many areas to overcome floods under the most difficult conditions, reduce the scope of disasters, and ensure the safety of agricultural production in vast areas and important cities, industrial and mining enterprises, and railway transportation along rivers. However, some areas still suffered serious floods and waterlogging due to excessive rainfall or improper defense, causing certain losses to national construction. Therefore, for this year's flood control work, all localities must remember the experiences and lessons of the past, especially last year, and strive to overcome floods. The following suggestions are hereby put forward, hoping that all localities will study and implement them in light of their specific circumstances.
    1. In recent years, although we have built many water conservancy projects, they have played a certain role in flood control. However, completely controlling the rivers of the country is a long-term task that cannot be achieved in the short term. At the same time, after recent years of investigation and research and the test of last year's extraordinary floods, it has been found that our past estimates of floods in some rivers were insufficient, and the standards of flood control planning and design were too low. For example, the Yellow River, the largest flood previously known was the flood of 1933, but according to recently discovered data, the largest flood in the lower reaches of the Yellow River may exceed that of 1933 by more than one time. Last year's floods in the Yangtze River, Huai River, and rivers in Hebei all exceeded the defense standards previously set. Therefore, leading organs and water conservancy departments in all localities must ideologically recognize the severity of flood disasters in our country and the long-term and complex nature of the flood control struggle. They must start from the worst situation, heighten their vigilance, take action early, and carry out various preparatory work.
    According to historical records, there are many records of large floods occurring in rivers for several consecutive years. For example, the floods in the Han River in 1937 and 1938 and the Daqing River in 1949 and 1950 were all above the guaranteed water level, and larger floods also occurred in the Yangtze River in 1948 and 1949 and the Yellow River in 1953 and 1954. Therefore, the paralyzing idea that an extraordinary flood occurred last year and there will be no major flood this year must be criticized. No matter whether the rivers experienced major floods last year or not, there should be no paralysis. It is necessary to heighten vigilance, plan carefully, prepare early, and strive to be prepared for any eventuality in work.
    2. Flood control work is related to the safety of the lives and property of the broad masses of people. Only by mobilizing and relying on the masses can we successfully complete the task. In order to strengthen leadership, all localities should, based on past experience, be responsible to the local people's government, invite local troops and relevant departments, and establish command organizations as early as possible. Local Party and government responsible comrades should personally lead, and a certain number of full-time responsible personnel should be assigned to set up offices to handle daily business. There should be a clear division of labor and responsibilities between flood control headquarters at all levels, so that each embankment section has a dedicated person in charge. For rivers within a province, the provincial flood control headquarters should be fully responsible. For rivers such as the Yellow River, Yangtze River, Huai River, and Pearl River that flow through several provinces, the river basin water conservancy authorities or river basin flood control command organizations should uniformly provide flood information, study water situation changes, and conduct upstream and downstream coordination and technical guidance, with each province defending its own section. Problems existing between regions should be resolved in a timely manner through meetings convened by river basin authorities or through proactive consultation by the provinces. When necessary, joint defense command organizations can also be established.
    The regular flood control teams and reserve teams of the masses in various localities should also be formed as soon as possible, dividing the embankment sections for defense and clarifying responsibilities. When deploying flood control work, it should be closely integrated with other central tasks in rural areas to avoid mutual influence. Flood control materials should be divided into regular materials and reserve materials, and methods such as key storage, mobile allocation, and advance ordering with payment after use should be adopted to ensure flood control needs and avoid waste. Soil for flood control should be prepared in embankment sections where soil is difficult to obtain during the flood season. Telecommunications equipment should be kept unobstructed under any circumstances, and transportation and lighting tools should also be planned in advance to facilitate the understanding of situations and support rescue work.
    3. Embankment projects occupy the most important position in the current national flood control projects. Many rivers can safely discharge large amounts of floodwater by strengthening embankments and defending them strictly. Therefore, within a certain limit, embankments are extremely useful tools for flood control. According to the characteristics of large rainfall in many areas of our country and the huge difference between flood and dry season flow in various rivers, even rivers with flood control reservoirs still have a positive role to play in embankments for discharging excess floodwater. However, after the test of last year's extraordinary floods, it was found that there are still serious shortcomings in embankments in various localities, such as loose embankment quality, insecure plugging, poor bonding of new and old soil, and hidden dangers inside the embankment body; some of them have caused dangerous works or breaches due to this. The embankment repair projects last winter and this spring also have very poor quality in many sections. Therefore, all localities are required to pay attention to this situation, conduct strict inspections, and make necessary repairs and reinforcements. Special attention should be paid to old breach sections, retreated embankment sections, and joint parts of various work sections.
    Regarding the inspection and elimination of hidden dangers in embankments, various localities have created some effective methods, such as the Yellow River embankment, which has conducted cone penetration inspections for several years and found tens of thousands of caves, which have been repaired. The Yangtze River embankment, when water leakage is found in embankment sections during the flood season, makes marks and reconstructs them when the water recedes, which are all good methods. This year, all localities must absorb these successful experiences and create new methods to promote them widely in order to improve the quality of embankments universally. In the future, all localities must establish a long-term perspective on the annual repair and maintenance of embankments, regard them as permanent projects, strengthen them year by year in a planned way, and immediately carry out tree planting and grass planting to establish a management and maintenance system, so as to gradually improve the flood resistance capacity of existing embankments.
    4. During last year's flood season, many regions and river basins underestimated the floods that might occur in various rivers and lacked thorough plans and preparations in advance, which caused difficulties and passivity. This year, all regions and river basins are required to fully estimate the possible floods in rivers within their regions and carefully prepare disaster prevention and mitigation plans based on existing engineering equipment.
    For rivers that already have flood diversion and storage projects, the competent authorities should, based on hydrological calculations, formulate methods for mutual coordination and unified utilization of various projects upstream and downstream, consult with the local Party and government leading organs, and make advance arrangements to avoid the phenomenon of mutual neglect when floods come without a comprehensive plan. All projects approved to be completed before the flood season must be completed on schedule by seizing the time. All buildings should improve management organizations and management systems to ensure effective use according to plan.
    For floods that existing projects can defend against, it is required to strengthen artificial efforts and resolutely ensure that no breaches occur. For extraordinary floods that exceed the defense standards of existing projects, temporary measures should be carefully prepared based on the principle of sacrificing a small part to preserve the whole, and sound utilization methods should be formulated to ensure that there are countermeasures and preparations for any type of flood. For those that already have temporary measures plans, they should also be revised with reference to the 1954 flood and utilization situation. Measures for wind and typhoon prevention should also be prepared for seawalls along the coast and rivers and lakes with wide water surfaces. All temporary measures plans should be submitted as soon as possible before the flood season, approved by the local Party and government organs, and reported to the Central Flood Control Headquarters for record.
    During the 1954 flood season, various localities created many new flood control and rescue technologies, which played a great role in rescuing dangerous situations and ensuring safety. For example, the Jianghan trunk dike of the Yangtze River had no breaches in the entire line of the trunk dike within the guaranteed water level. The Dongjiaguai of the Jingjiang Dike and the Wuqing Dike of Wuhan City were both at high water levels, and the dikes were slipping and were on the verge of collapse. Because the rescue methods of opening ditches to guide seepage, filling ponds to consolidate the foundation, adding soil to restore the slope, and adding soil to the water slope were adopted, the crisis was turned into safety. However, some areas mistakenly judged the dangerous situation and used incorrect rescue methods, or even used soil bags to block leaks on the ground on the back of the river, resulting in unnecessary breaches or wasting too much manpower and material resources. These experiences and lessons should be learned in 1955 to further improve flood control and rescue technology. All regions are required to hold flood control symposiums or flood control and rescue technology training classes before the flood season to deploy flood control work, disseminate scientific knowledge, summarize and exchange various successful technologies and experiences, and implement them level by level so that the technology can be mastered by the masses.
    Houses or villages that have suffered from mountain floods over the years should be mobilized to move under possible conditions, or prepare places for the masses to avoid, stipulate methods for passing on flood information, and make early prevention arrangements to reduce the loss of people, livestock, and property. For the masses in the flood diversion area, it is necessary to do a good job in mobilization beforehand and formulate methods for resettlement, compensation, and relief for the masses in accordance with different situations.
    5. Conduct flood control inspections at all levels to ensure the implementation of various preparations. In order to overcome paralyzing ideas and strengthen preparations before the flood season, all localities should conduct a major inspection of work before the flood season in a timely manner. The inspection content should include flood control organization, publicity and mobilization, necessary material preparation, the situation of dangerous river sections and river flow changes, the elimination of hidden dangers in the embankment body, the quality of dikes at dangerous works and closing points, temporary flood control measures, and the management and operation of sluices and dams. At the same time, attention should also be paid to clearing obstacles in the river channel that hinder the flow of water. For culvert gates used by the masses along the river for irrigation and drainage, designated personnel should be assigned to strictly manage them, and the permeable wells should be checked for any harm to the embankment and properly handled. Last year, some places first used the old dike to block water in the retreated embankment section, and then dug up the old dike and used the new dike to block water at high water levels, which caused breaches due to improper handling. This year, these embankment sections should be inspected to determine the main defense dike line. After the flood season, the dangerous embankment sections should continue to be inspected to find weaknesses and carry out repairs.
    6. In order to improve predictability and grasp the initiative in flood control work, all localities should establish close contact with meteorological agencies during the flood season, and at the same time further strengthen hydrological work, expand the scope of forecasting, improve forecasting accuracy, and extend the forecasting period, so that the flood control command organs of various provinces and important embankment sections can grasp the overall situation in a timely manner, analyze and study, and put forward countermeasures in a timely manner to guide the work.
    In 1954, most of the dangerous situations occurred at night. This was mainly due to the lack of patrols, which led to the expansion of the dangerous situation and the failure to rescue it in time, resulting in disasters. Therefore, this year, it is necessary to strengthen the work of patrolling embankments to find dangerous situations, and especially during stormy and rainy nights, it is necessary to seize the opportunity to rescue and protect them in time. The flood control experience in 1954 proves that seizing the time between flood peaks to vigorously carry out embankment reinforcement is one of the important measures to overcome floods. Last year, the Jingjiang Dike and Wuhan City insisted on seizing this link, consolidating the effectiveness of temporary rescue projects, implementing the requirement of "raising the dike with the rising water," and achieving brilliant victories. The Huai River Basin and North China region rapidly completed the reinforcement and wave prevention projects of the Huai River trunk dike, the Canal dike, the south dike of the irrigation canal, the Qianli Dike, and the north dike of the Duliujian River, which all had great effects. However, some areas did not use this opportunity to reinforce the embankment, so that during the flood peak interval, tens of millions of people had no work to do, wasted labor, and the dangerous situation reappeared repeatedly when the flood arrived. In 1955, all regions must pay attention to this work, and must organize forces to repair dangerous works and weak embankment sections during the flood season to meet the next flood peak.
    During the 1954 flood season, individual areas discovered incidents of lawless elements sabotaging flood control work. This year, all localities should still raise their political vigilance and strictly prevent the enemy from spreading rumors and sabotage.
    7. Flood control work should be combined with drainage and drought prevention work. In the past few years, mountain floods and waterlogging disasters have accounted for a large proportion of the country's floods, and attention should also be paid to studying prevention and control methods this year. For areas where mountain flood disasters occur frequently, water and soil conservation work should be carried out in conjunction with farmland water conservancy work, mountain ponds should be built to store water, and the safety of completed projects should be checked. For areas where waterlogging often occurs during the flood season, various different measures should be studied according to the specific situation. In some areas, ditch and ridge fields can be promoted to disperse water storage to avoid the concentration of rainwater. In some areas, it is possible to advocate planting early-maturing, water-resistant, or high-stalk crops to increase production and reduce the degree of disaster. Where conditions permit drainage, efforts should be made to organize the masses to carry out drainage. In some areas where large-scale rain and floodwater often accumulate, some low-lying areas can also be delineated to stop the rain and reduce the waterlogging disasters in vast areas. Farmers in water storage areas should be guided and assisted to gradually switch to other industries or engage in aquaculture and fishery production.
    During the flood season, the weather changes frequently, and the alternation of drought and flood is a situation that is often encountered in various localities. Therefore, flood control and drought prevention work must be closely combined to achieve the purpose of ensuring agricultural production. In the past few years, some places dug up embankments to release water during the drought prevention period without repairing them, and floods suddenly came, causing floods. Some places lacked management of water storage ponds and did not release water during the flood season, resulting in damage. Some places released water too early, or did not repair the projects destroyed by floods in time, which affected water storage and drought prevention. These are all the consequences of ideological paralysis in leadership and the failure to combine drought prevention and flood control. This year, all localities must deeply understand the actual situation of agricultural production, grasp the trend of weather and water situation changes, and earnestly achieve the overall combination of flood control and drought prevention work. During the drought prevention and drought resistance period, we should pay attention to preparing for flood control, and after the heavy water, we must pay attention to water storage and drought prevention.
    At present, the flood season has arrived in Guangdong, Fujian, and other places, and other regions will also enter the flood control preparation period. All localities should take action immediately and fight to overcome this year's floods.

    中华人民共和国中央防汛总指挥部关于一九五五年防汛工作的指示
    一九五四年的防汛工作，由于当地党委及政府强有力的领导，当地群众的艰苦努力，全国人民的大力支援，加以几年来所修防洪工程发挥了作用，许多地区在最艰苦的条件下战胜了洪水，缩小了受灾范围，保障了广大地区农业生产及沿江河重要城市、工矿、铁路交通的安全；但是仍然有部分地区因雨量过大或防御失宜，遭受严重的洪水和内涝灾害，对国家建设造成一定的损失。因此，今年的防汛工作，各地必须记取过去特别是去年的经验教训，为战胜洪水而奋斗。兹特提出以下几项意见，希各地结合具体情况研究执行。
    一、几年来，我们虽然修了许多水利工程，在防御洪水上也发挥了一定的效益。但是完全治好全国的河流，是一个长期的任务，不是短期内所能实现的。同时，经过最近几年的调查研究和去年特大洪水的考验，发现我们过去对有些河流的洪水，估计尚有不足，防洪规划设计的标准偏低。比如黄河，过去所知道的最大洪水是一九三三年的洪水，可是根据最近发现的资料，黄河下游的最大洪水可能超过一九三三年一倍以上。长江、淮河、河北各河去年的洪水，也都超过过去拟订的防御标准。因此，各地领导机关和水利工作部门必须从思想上认识我国洪水灾害的严重性和防汛斗争的长期性、复杂性，从最坏的情况出发，提高警惕及早动手，进行各项准备工作。
    根据历史记载，各河流连续几年发生较大洪水的记录，已屡见不鲜。如汉水一九三七、一九三八年，大清河一九四九、一九五○年的洪水均在保证水位以上，长江一九四八、一九四九年，黄河一九五三、一九五四年都曾发生较大洪水。因此认为去年已经发生特大洪水，今年不会再发大水的麻痹思想，必须加以批判。对去年曾经发生大水的河流及去年未曾发生大水的河流均不应有任何麻痹，必须提高警惕，周密计划，及早准备，在工作上做到有备无患。
    二、防汛工作关系广大人民生命财产的安全，必须动员和依靠群众，才能胜利完成任务。为了加强领导，各地应本过去经验，由地方人民政府负责，邀请当地驻军及有关部门，及早成立指挥机构，请地方党政负责同志亲自领导，并配备一定数量的专职负责人员，成立办公室，处理日常业务。各级防汛指挥部间应有明确的分工和责任，做到每一堤段都有专人负责。凡一省以内的河流，应由省防汛指挥部负完全责任；黄河、长江、淮河、珠江等流经数省的河流，应由流域水利机关或流域防汛指挥机关，统一供给洪水情报，研究水势变化，并进行上下游的联系配合及技术指导，由各省分段防守。各地区间存在的问题，应由流域机关召集会议或由各省主动协商，及时解决，必要时亦可成立联防指挥机构。
    各地群众防汛的常备队后备队，亦应尽早组成，划分防守堤段，明确责任。在布置防汛工作时，应和农村其他中心工作密切结合，以免互相影响。防汛器材应分别常备物料和后备物料，采取重点储备、机动调拨及预先订购、用后付款等办法，以保证防汛需要，并避免浪费。在汛期取土困难的堤段，须准备防汛用土。电讯设备要作到在任何情况下畅通无阻，交通及照明工具亦应预加筹划，以便利掌握情况及支援抢险工作。
    三、堤防工程在目前全国的防洪工程中，占着最重要的地位。许多河流依靠加强堤防，严密防守，即可安全宣泄大量的洪水，所以在一定限度内，堤防是防御洪水极有利的工具。根据我国许多地区雨量较大，各河洪水与枯水流量悬殊的特点，即使修有拦洪水库的河流，为宣泄过量洪水，堤防仍有其积极的作用。但是经过去年特大洪水的考验，发现各地堤防仍然存在严重的缺点，如堤质松软，堵口不牢，新旧土结合不好，堤身内部存在隐患；有的即因此而造成险工或决口。去冬今春的堤防整修工程，也有许多堤段质量很差。因此，要求各地重视这一情况，进行严格检查，作必要的修补加强。对旧决口堤段、退建堤段、各工段接合部分，尤须注意。
    关于检查消灭堤防隐患，各地已经创造了一些行之有效的办法，如黄河堤防，几年来进行锥探检查，会发见几万处洞穴，进行了修补。长江堤防，在汛期涨水时，发见漏水堤段即做出标记，在水落时进行翻筑，都是很好的办法。今年各地必须吸取这些成功经验，并创造新的方法，广泛推行，以普遍提高堤防质量。今后各地对于堤防的岁修养护，必须树立长期观点，视为永久性工程，有计划地逐年加强，并立即进行植树种草，建立管理养护制度，以逐步提高现有堤防的抗洪能力。
    四、去年汛期有很多地区和流域，对各河可能发生的洪水估计不足，事前缺乏周密的计划和准备工作，因而造成困难和被动。今年要求各地区、各流域，对区域以内的河流，充分估计可能发生的洪水，并根据现有工程设备，慎重地预筹免灾减灾的防御计划。
    凡已有分洪、蓄洪工程的河流，主管机关应根据水文演算，制定各个工程上下游互相配合、统一运用的办法，商得地方党政领导机关同意，预加布置，以免洪水来时没有通盘计划，发生互不照顾的现象。凡批准汛前完成的工程，要抓紧时间按期完成。所有建筑物均应健全管理机构和管理制度，保证按计划有效运用。
    凡是现有工程可以防御的洪水，要求加强人为的努力，切实保证不发生溃决，对于超过现有工程防御标准的特大洪水，则要根据牺牲小部保全大部的原则，妥慎预筹临时措施，并订出妥善的运用办法，要做到在任何类型洪水情况下均能有对策、有准备。其已有临时措施计划的，也应参照一九五四年洪水和运用情况加以修订。对于沿海的海堤及水面广阔的江河湖泊，亦应预筹防风防颱的措施。所有临时措施计划统应于汛前尽早提出，由当地党政机关批准，报中央防汛总指挥部备案。
    一九五四年汛期各地创造了很多新的防汛抢险技术，对抢救险情确保安全起了很大作用，如长江江汉干堤在保证水位以内，全线干堤无一处溃决，荆江大堤董家拐，武汉市武清大堤，都是在高水位下，大堤脱坡，已濒溃决，因为采用开沟导渗、填塘固基、加土还坡，并在临水坡加土的抢险方法，转危为安。但也有些地区错误地判断险情，使用不正确的抢险方法，甚至在背河平地上用压土袋的办法抢堵漏洞，致造成不应有的决口，或浪费了过多人力物力。一九五五年应吸取这些经验教训，进一步提高防汛抢险技术。要求各地区在汛前举行防汛座谈会或防汛抢险技术训练班，布置防汛工作，传播科学知识，总结、交流各种成功的技术和经验，并逐级贯彻，使技术为群众所掌握。
    对历年遭受山洪灾害的房屋或村庄，要在可能条件下动员迁移，或准备群众趋避场所，规定传汛办法，早做预防安排，以减免人畜财物的损失。对分洪区群众要事前做好动员工作，并根据不同情况，妥善拟定对群众迁移赔偿、救济的办法。
    五、逐级做好防汛大检查，以保证各项准备工作的贯彻实施。为了克服麻痹思想和加强汛前准备工作，各地应及时进行汛前工作大检查。检查内容应包括防汛组织、宣传动员、必要的物料准备、险工河段河势水流变化情况、堤身隐患消灭情况、险工、合龙处堤质情况、临时防汛措施、闸坝管理和操做运用情况等。同时并应注意清除河道中阻碍行水的障碍物。对沿河群众灌溉和排水用的涵洞闸门，要指定负责人员严密管理，对透堤井要检查对堤防有无危害，妥加处理。去年有些地方在退建堤段，先用旧堤挡水，在高水位下又掘开旧堤用新堤挡水，处理不当，造成溃决。今年对这些堤段，要加以检查，决定主要防守堤线。在汛期行水以后，对险要堤段仍应继续检查，以发现弱点，进行修补。
    六、为提高预见性，掌握防汛工作的主动权，各地在大汛期间应和气象机关取得密切联系，同时进一步加强水情工作，扩大预报范围，提高预报精度，加长预见期限，使各省区及重要堤段防汛指挥机关能及时掌握全面情况，分析研究，并适时提出对策，指导工作。
      一九五四年绝大部分险情是在夜间发生的。这主要是由于疏于巡查，使险情扩大，抢救不及，因而溃决成灾。因此，今年必须加强巡堤查险工作，在暴风暴雨夜间，尤须抓紧，发现险情及时抢护。　一九五四年的防汛经验证明，抓紧洪峰间隙时间，大力进行整险加固，是战胜洪水重要措施之一。去年荆江大堤及武汉市，由于坚持不懈地抓紧这一环节，巩固了临时抢护工程的效用，贯彻了“水涨堤高”的要求，获得了光辉胜利。淮河流域及华北地区迅速完成了淮河干堤、运河堤、灌溉总渠南堤、千里堤及独流减河北堤等堤的加固和防浪工程，都曾发生很大效用。但也有的地区，没有利用这一时机整险加固，致在洪峰间隙时间，千万群众无工可做，浪费了劳动力，洪水一到险象仍然重复出现。一九五五年各地区必须重视这一工作，必须在防汛期间趁洪水低落时期组织力量整修险工和薄弱堤段，以迎接下次洪峰。
    一九五四年汛期，曾有个别地区发现不法分子破坏防汛工作的事件，今年各地仍应提高政治警惕，严防敌人的造谣和破坏。
    七、防汛工作要和排涝防旱工作相结合。过去几年山洪和内涝灾害，在全国水灾中占很大的比重，今年也要注意研究防治办法。对于经常发生山洪灾害的地区，应结合农田水利工作，进行水土保持工作，修筑山塘蓄水，并检查已成工程的安全情况。对洪水时期经常发生内涝的地区，要根据具体情况，研究各种不同的措施。有些地区，可以推行沟洫畦田，分散蓄水，以避免雨水的集中。有些地区，可以提倡种植早熟、耐水或高秆作物，以增加生产并减轻受灾的程度。有条件排水的地方，要尽量组织群众进行排水。有些经常发生大面积雨涝积水的地区，亦可划出一部分洼地停潴雨水，以减免广大地区的内涝灾害，而对蓄水地区的农民则应引导扶助逐步转业或从事水产渔业生产。
    汛期天气变化较多，旱涝交错是各地经常遇到的情况，因此防汛和防旱工作必须密切结合，以达到保障农业生产的目的。几年来有的地方在防旱时期扒堤放水，未曾堵复，洪水骤至，造成水灾。有的地方对蓄水塘堰缺乏管理，汛期没有放水，致遭冲毁。也有些地方过早放水，或对洪水冲毁的工程没有及时修复，影响蓄水防旱。这都是领导上思想麻痹，防旱和防汛不相结合的后果。今年各地必须深入了解农业生产的实际情况，并掌握天气和水情变化的趋向，切实做到防汛和防旱工作的统筹结合。在防旱、抗旱时期即应注意到准备防汛，而在大水之后，又须注意到蓄水防旱。
    目前，广东、福建等地，汛期已到，其他地区也将进入防汛准备时期，各地应立即行动起来，为战胜今年的洪水而斗争。
