　　We are greedy for more, bigger, and faster, seriously wasting national funds
　　Xing Zitao, Director of Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant
　　The basic construction of the Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant began with design in 1950 and construction in 1951. The first phase of the project will be basically completed by the end of this year. Over the past few years, we have basically completed the basic construction tasks, and the completed workshops have gradually been put into production, manufacturing many motors and 6,000-kilowatt hydro-generators, etc., supporting national construction. However, due to our lack of basic understanding of the importance of socialist economic construction capital accumulation, and a lack of a high sense of responsibility for factory construction, and the existence of serious bourgeois viewpoints in our leadership thinking, the waste caused in construction has been extremely serious.
　　The higher authorities have repeatedly instructed us to implement the policy of key construction and steady progress, and to overcome the erroneous idea that "more is better than less, and bigger is better than smaller." However, we have given little consideration to how to economically and rationally plan the factory's construction work within the national investment limit, fully exert the effect of investment, and save national construction funds. For several years, the leadership has not been clear about the total amount of factory investment. When auditing the factory's investment and usage in 1954, although it was known that the investment limit had been exceeded, the reason was always that the higher authorities had not finalized the five-year factory construction investment amount. We wanted to find advantages in this aspect, emphasizing omissions and excessive design modifications, and large price differences in equipment, etc., in an attempt to compensate for the factory's investment overruns. The determination of annual basic construction projects was also not cautious enough. We were always greedy for more, bigger, and faster, resulting in serious waste of national investment. The 12,000-square-meter project for insulation workshop two and the paint workshop was completed in 1953, but due to a lack of careful estimation of the arrival time of foreign equipment, they could not all be put into production. Some equipment and materials were eager to participate in balancing before the design was finalized, and specifications were casually proposed. The four large punching machines worth 830,000 yuan ordered from abroad in 1951 have not yet been fully put into production because the specifications are not entirely in accordance with the requirements. The 8-meter lathe worth 1 million yuan will have to be reserved for use after the third quarter of 1957. According to the preliminary statistics of the joint inspection with the design unit in May 1954, the Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant had an average of 8.12 million yuan of accumulated investment for more than one year, including 4.08 million yuan of accumulated equipment and 880,000 yuan of accumulated materials. These all show that we always want more money, build more houses, and buy more machines, but rarely consider how to quickly put fixed assets into expanded reproduction.
　　Due to our insufficient understanding of economic accounting and the existence of serious supply system thinking, we believe that "as long as we can complete the task," so in project management, the review of budget contracts is not enough, resulting in large price differences. In order to avoid affecting the relationship between parties A and B, there is also little supervision of the waste of the contracting unit. In order to strive for early commencement, we even started construction without following the national regulations and procedures, without a contract or budget. Some even waited until the project was completed before the budget was compiled. It was nominally contracting labor and setting quotas, but in reality, it was actual reimbursement. The reason for this serious waste phenomenon is mainly that we lack understanding of the importance of accumulating funds for socialist economic construction. We are often complacent about completing tasks in terms of numbers, but rarely ask whether national funds are being used reasonably or whether there is waste. We simply think that since the construction project has been approved, the state will always allocate funds. Managing money is just a matter of transferring it. We only feel that there is not enough money, and we do not realize the need to save funds for the state. Moreover, we believe that the scale is large, and a little waste is inevitable. Some cadres said: "In the past, when managing the basic construction of small factories, we regarded sand as grain, but now there are things all over the yard, and it is impossible to save." In fact, for such huge investment construction projects, as long as we tighten our grip, saving 1% of the investment each year will accumulate more than 300,000 yuan for the country. But we did not do this. This fully shows that our understanding of self-saving for socialist economic construction is very unclear.
　　From the perspective of planning work, the main problem is the lack of an overall plan. In a factory with such a large investment, a long construction period, and a long-term state of construction and production, the enterprise leadership should first consider a long-term overall factory construction plan. From technical design to civil construction, from equipment purchase to installation and acceptance, from project completion to production, as well as investment allocation and construction priority, etc., there should be an overall arrangement and deployment in order to quickly transfer national investment to expanded reproduction. However, the Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant, from the beginning of design in 1950 to the end of 1953, did not have an overall plan for the entire project. We did whatever we thought of, and there was a lot of blindness in the construction. We repaired and stopped, added and modified, and reversed the order, resulting in extremely serious waste. Some even caused irreparable shortcomings, such as the insulation plant, which requires a clean working environment, being placed downwind of the boiler room. More than 3,000 square meters of warehouses, 1,000 meters of trenches, 3,000 meters of heating pipelines, and one kilometer of dedicated railway that had been built all had to be demolished and rebuilt due to improper overall layout. The projects that were built and had to be demolished and rebuilt alone wasted about 440,000 yuan of national investment. In terms of the priority of factory building construction, the preparation workshop and auxiliary workshop were not built first, but the main workshop for medium-sized motors was built first. Due to the lack of cooperation from the preparation workshop and auxiliary workshop, and the lack of necessary power, many temporary measures had to be adopted, which put the medium-sized motor workshop in a state of production chaos for a long time. The design of the factory's power system was not completed until 1953. As a result of relying on temporary lines, as many as 11 transformers were accumulated. Some workshop buildings were built, but due to the lack of planning for production preparation, the equipment was not ordered and was left idle. For example, the paint resin factory building built with more than one million yuan had to be rented to an engineering company for processing because the machines had not arrived. Although this is inseparable from our lack of experience in such complex factory construction work, the main reason is that we have not seriously studied and learned, and have not well grasped the regularity of basic construction work, so that some problems in factory construction have existed for a long time and have not been resolved. The inspection of the waste in the construction of the Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant is also inseparable from the bourgeois ideology in our leadership thinking. Over the past few years, we have fostered the idea of extravagance, waste, and greed for more and bigger. We always emphasize our own specialness, only seek our own convenience, and disregard the country's difficulties. We want new machinery and equipment, large factory areas, and more welfare facilities. This view, which only seeks to decorate the facade and does not proceed from actual production needs and economic applicability, and does not proceed from the current national economic situation and the living standards of the working people, shows that there are quite serious bourgeois viewpoints in the leadership's thinking. For example, the factory construction land has been surrounded by an area of more than one million square meters since 1950. After the factory's general plan was determined, only 600,000 square meters was enough, but we insisted on retaining the more than 40,000 square meters in the western corner of the general plan for factory development, which was actually not needed. We always felt that the two vertical lathes and lathes transferred from Shenyang to the hydro-generator factory building were too old and not easy to use, and we wanted to replace them with new ones. Another vertical lathe was proposed as essential production equipment and requested to be installed quickly because the investment was over budget and the current output was not large, and the design unit suggested postponing the purchase. In terms of welfare facilities, we were always afraid that the offices and canteens were too small. The leadership once instructed us not to think of ourselves as the key point and exaggerate ourselves everywhere, but to be more humble and down-to-earth. However, these instructions did not arouse our due vigilance. We did not inspect the serious waste phenomenon, and we did not summarize and commend good examples of saving in our work in a timely manner, such as the equipment department using more than 380 mats picked up at the construction site to build temporary warehouses, picking up more than 10,000 bricks from the accumulated soil, and picking up more than two tons of Soviet steel pipes from the lost material heads.
　　To accept the lessons from the factory construction work in recent years and overcome waste in basic construction, we must correct the leadership's thinking in the future, educate all employees to fully understand the great significance of increasing production and practicing economy and opposing waste to socialist economic construction, and launch a comprehensive anti-waste struggle. We will conduct a strict inspection of the waste phenomenon in past construction projects, and make necessary revisions to the aspects of quotas, structure, and equipment for projects that have not yet been constructed, based on the principle of saving. At the same time, we must strengthen the financial work in basic construction, strengthen the review of budget contracts, implement financial supervision, and strictly practice saving funds.
　　In addition, we must carefully compile the overall plan, conduct an in-depth investigation of the actual needs of production, production preparation, labor organization, materials, tools, etc., and formulate specific plans and indicators based on the principles of saving and advancement, and earnestly implement them. At the same time, we must make the basic construction plan and the production plan well connected to fully exert the investment effect of national construction.

    我们贪多贪大贪快严重浪费了国家资金
    哈尔滨电机厂厂长  邢子陶
    哈尔滨电机厂的基本建设工程是从一九五○年起开始设计，一九五一年起开始施工的，到今年年底，第一期工程将基本结束。几年来我们基本上完成了基本建设任务，完工车间已逐步投入生产，并制造了许多电机和六千瓩水轮发电机等，支援了国家的建设。但由于我们对社会主义经济建设资金积累的重要性缺乏基本认识，对建厂工作缺乏高度的责任心，领导思想上存在着严重的资产阶级观点，因而在建设中造成的浪费是极其严重的。
    上级曾一再指示要贯彻重点建设、稳步前进的方针，要我们克服“多比少好，大比小好”的错误思想，但我们对如何在国家投资限额内经济地合理地筹划工厂的建设工作，充分发挥投资效果，节省国家建设资金的考虑是很少的。几年来工厂投资总额究竟多少，领导上长期摸不清楚，在一九五四年核算工厂投资使用状况时，虽然知道超过了投资限额，但总以上级五年建厂投资额尚未最后确定为理由，想在这方面找便宜，强调漏列项目，设计修改太多，设备价差很大等客观原因，以图弥补工厂投资超支。对年度基本建设项目的确定也不够慎重，总是贪多贪大贪快，以致造成国家投资的严重浪费，绝缘二车间和油漆车间共一万二千平方公尺的工程，在一九五三年就建成了，但没有慎重估计国外设备到达的时间，以至还不能全部投入生产。有的设备和材料在设计未定之前就急于参加平衡，随便提规格，一九五一年在国外订的四台价值八十三万元的大冲床，因规格不完全合乎要求，至今还没有全部投入生产，价值一百万元的八公尺车床，要留待一九五七年第三季以后才能使用。根据一九五四年五月与设计单位共同检查时的初步统计，哈尔滨电机厂积压投资平均在一年以上的共八百一十二万元，其中积压设备价值四百零八万元，积压器材八十八万元。这些都说明我们总多要钱，多盖房子，多买机器，却很少考虑如何迅速将固定资产投入扩大再生产。
    由于我们对经济核算认识不足，存在着严重的供给制思想，认为“只要能完成任务就可以了”，所以在工程管理中，对预算合同的审核不够，以至价差很大，为了怕影响甲乙两方关系，对承包单位浪费的现象也很少监督。为了争取早开工，甚至不按国家规定手续，没有合同、没有预算就先行开工，有的甚至等工程完了预算还没有编出来，名是包工包定额，实则是实报实销。产生这种严重浪费现象的原因，主要是我们对社会主义经济建设资金积累的重要性缺乏认识，常沾沾自喜于在数字上完成任务，而对国家资金是否得到合理运用，是否存在浪费现象，很少过问。单纯以为建设项目既已批定，国家总要拨款，管钱只是转手，只感觉钱不够用，没有认识到需要为国家节约资金。而且认为摊子大，浪费一点也在所难免。有的干部说：“以前管小厂的基本建设，看沙子像粮食一样，现在满院是东西，无法节省。”事实上像这样投资巨大的建设工程，只要紧一紧手，每年节约百分之一的投资，就给国家积累三十多万元的资金。但我们并未这样做。这充分说明我们对为社会主义经济建设而自行节约的认识是很不明确的。
    从计划工作上来检查，主要是缺乏一个总体计划，在这样一个投资大，建设时期长，长期处在边建设边生产中的工厂，企业的领导，首先就应该考虑一个长远的建厂总体计划，从技术设计到土建施工，从购置设备到安装验收，从工程完工到投入生产，以及投资的分配和建设的先后等等，都应该有一个总的安排和布置，以便迅速将国家投资转入扩大再生产。但哈尔滨电机厂，从一九五○年开始设计到一九五三年止，整个工程没有一个总体计划，干到那算到那，工程建筑存在很大的盲目性，修修停停，添添改改，次序倒置，因而造成的浪费现象极为严重。有的甚至造成了不可补救的缺点，如需要工作环境清洁的绝缘厂房却放在锅炉房的下风方向，建好的三千多平方公尺的仓库、一千公尺的地沟、三千公尺的热力管路和一公里专用铁路，都由于没有总体布置，位置不当，要全部拆去重建。仅这些建了又不得不拆，拆了又要重建的工程就浪费了国家投资约四十四万元。在厂房建筑的先后次序上，没有修好准备车间和辅助车间，就先修了中型电机主要厂房，由于没有准备车间和辅助车间的配合，也没有必需的动力，就不得不采用许多临时措施，使中型电机车间长期处于生产混乱状态。全厂电力系统设计一九五三年才做完，依靠临时线路的结果，仅变压器就积压十一台之多。而有的车间厂房盖好后，由于生产准备工作缺乏计划，设备未订而闲置起来，如用一百余万元盖起来的油漆树脂厂房，因机器未到，不得不租给工程公司作加工厂用。这些虽然是和我们对于这样复杂的建厂工作缺乏经验分不开的，但主要还是由于我们没有认真钻研学习，没有很好地掌握基本建设工作的规律性，因而使建厂工作中的一些问题长期存在，未能得到解决。检查哈尔滨电机厂建厂中的浪费，也是和我们领导思想上的资产阶级思想分不开的。几年来，我们滋长了铺张浪费贪大贪多的思想，总强调自己特殊，只求自己方便，不顾国家困难，机器设备要新，厂房面积要大，福利设施要多，这种只图装饰门面，不从实际生产需要和经济适用出发，不从当前的国民经济状况和劳动人民生活水平出发的观点，说明了领导思想上存在着相当严重的资产阶级观点。如工厂建筑用地，从一九五○年起就围了一百余万平方公尺的面积，工厂总平面确定以后，只要六十万平方公尺就够了，但总平面上厂西部缺角的四万余平方公尺，我们坚持要保留作工厂发展用，实际这是并不需要的。对水轮发电机厂房两台由沈阳迁来的立镟及车床，总觉得太旧、不好用，要换新的。另有一台立镟，因投资超支而且目前产量不大，设计单位建议暂缓购买，我们却把它提出作为生产必需的设备，要求很快安装。在福利设施方面，对办公室、食堂总唯恐其小。领导上曾指示我们不要自以为是重点，处处夸张自己，而更应虚心、踏实。但这些指示并没有引起我们应有的警惕，对严重浪费现象没有进行检查，对于工作中好的节约例子，如设备科利用在工地上拣来的三百八十多张席子，盖了临时仓库，在积土中拣出一万余块砖，在散失的料头中拣了二吨多苏联钢管等，也没有及时总结表扬。
    接受这几年来建厂工作中的教训，克服基本建设中的浪费，今后必须端正领导思想，教育全体职工充分认识增产节约和反对浪费对社会主义经济建设的重大意义，开展一个全面的反浪费斗争，将过去建筑工程浪费现象进行一次严格的检查，对今后尚未建设的项目，在定额方面、结构方面、设备方面根据节约的原则加以必要的修改。同时必须加强基本建设方面的财务工作，加强对预算合同的审核，实行财务监督，厉行资金节约。
    此外，还必须认真编好总体计划，对生产、生产准备、劳动组织、材料、工具等等的实际需要作一次深入的摸底，根据节约和先进的原则拟出具体的计划和指标，切实执行。同时并使基本建设计划和生产计划很好衔接起来，充分发挥国家建设的投资效果。
