　　Around eight o'clock in the morning, Banqiao Town, Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, becomes lively. The sides of the streets are lined with baskets of vegetables, fish, shrimp, and other agricultural and sideline products. In some shops with new signs such as "General Merchandise Sales Group," "Sundries Cooperative Group," and "Noodle Cooperative Group," people are already coming and going. Next to the counter of the Sundries Cooperative Group, a farmer comes to buy cellophane noodles one moment, and workers come to buy cigarettes and bread the next. At the General Merchandise Sales Group's counter, there's a school teacher buying a whistle, and a group of young rural girls selecting hair oil, socks, and towels. The customers look satisfied, they've bought everything they needed, and they didn't have to wait in line. At the start of the market day, two oil peddlers with shoulder poles and eight peddlers with carrying poles have already set off to the surrounding villages of Fengya and Fenglin. They deliver daily necessities to the farmers in the villages and exchange them for old copper, scrap iron, rags, and waste cotton, which they sell to the supply and marketing cooperative. Farmers no longer have to go to town for a needle or a thread.

　　Banqiao Town has a total of eighty-five shopkeepers and forty-five stall vendors. Except for three commercial capitalists and one rich peasant engaged in commerce, all the rest are small merchants and vendors. There are no state-owned stores in the town, but there is a district supply and marketing cooperative, as well as four handicraft cooperative groups for iron, wood, bamboo, and sewing. At the beginning of this year, the supply and marketing cooperative began to transform the small merchants and vendors. Forty-five households have now been organized, forming two sales groups for general merchandise and butchery, four cooperative groups for noodles, sundries, tofu, and restaurants, one cotton cloth sales shop, and a peddler group with two oil peddlers and eight peddlers with carrying poles.

　　Because the organization is in the right direction, the business is large, and the expenses are low, the turnover of each cooperative group in January was higher than in December 1954. Because of the rational division of labor and the reduction of expenses, in January, three groups, after deducting expenses and wages, had a surplus of one hundred and ten yuan. At the same time, the turnover of the supply and marketing cooperative did not decrease in January. Among them, sundries increased by 30% compared with December 1954; general merchandise increased by 4.16%; butchery increased by 76.75%; and wholesale business was increased, with goods being wholesaled every five days according to the purchase plans of the sales groups and cooperative groups. As a result of the transformation of small merchants and vendors, the supply and marketing cooperative has been able to rationally arrange the rural commercial network, facilitate farmers' buying and selling, reduce queuing and crowding in the supply and marketing cooperative, restore the normal economic life of the broad masses of farmers, and make the rural market increasingly active.

　　Before the beginning of this year, the cadres of the district supply and marketing cooperative had insufficient understanding of the significance of leading the rural market and comprehensively arranging rural private merchants. In their actual work, they relaxed their leadership and care for them. As a result, the retail sales of private merchants decreased significantly. In addition, the area suffered from floods in 1954, and fifty-eight private merchants closed down or moved away one after another. In this way, the task of supplying the people of the surrounding seven villages and one town fell almost entirely on the shoulders of the district supply and marketing cooperative. Starting in the second half of 1954, the staff of the supply and marketing cooperative were extremely busy every day, managing everything from oil, salt, sauce, vegetables to general merchandise. People in the villages and towns had to queue for almost everything they bought. There were many things that they couldn't buy even after queuing. Some small merchants and vendors saw that the supply and marketing cooperative was out of stock, so they raised prices. This disrupted the normal supply work in the countryside and created some tensions in the supply of materials. At the same time, more than two hundred small merchants and vendors were idle because of the lack of hot-selling goods and the accumulation of unsalable goods.

　　In December 1954, the Banqiao Town Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted education for the cadres of relevant units such as the Party, government, trade union, cooperative, bank, and tax office on the significance and policies of transforming small merchants and vendors. In response to the view of some cadres that "small merchants and vendors cannot farm, nor can they work, so they cannot be considered working people," they were told that small merchants and vendors are laborers engaged in labor in the process of commodity circulation. After clarifying the boundaries between small merchants and vendors and commercial capitalists, and eliminating the cadres' hostile emotions towards small merchants and vendors, they began to transform the small merchants and vendors. In the process of carrying out this transformation work, some cadres of the district supply and marketing cooperative still had doubts about the policy of properly arranging private merchants, believing that "the proportion given is limitless," worrying that they would not be able to complete their business plan, and unwilling to approve goods for the organized groups. Qi Dahong, the supply group leader of the district supply and marketing cooperative, knew in advance that the general merchandise group in the town was going to wholesale steel needles, but when the superior cooperative sent two hundred packages of needles, he quickly transferred them to the Jiangning and Guli distribution offices of the supply and marketing cooperative. Dai Heng, the leader of the general merchandise sales group, went to him to purchase goods, and it took him ten trips to get a single purchase. After discovering these problems, the leaders of the district supply and marketing cooperative conducted education for the cadres again, explaining that leading private merchants through wholesale business and letting them undertake part of the commodity circulation task would only strengthen the role of socialist commerce in the rural economy; and also pointed out that as long as market needs can be correctly estimated and correct supply and marketing plans can be formulated, the supply and marketing tasks can still be completed. In this way, the idea of squeezing out small merchants and vendors was corrected, and the transformation work was able to proceed smoothly.

　　After the cadres explained to the small merchants and vendors that they were working people, they were generally very excited. However, they had many concerns about organizing, mainly fearing that everyone would not manage well together, and fearing that they would suffer losses. The local Party and government leading organs and the supply and marketing cooperative educated them through symposiums of small merchants and vendors, commercial conferences, group meetings, family meetings, and individual chats, so that they recognized the path they should take, their future, and the benefits of organizing, which improved their enthusiasm for business. When organizing, different organizational forms were adopted according to social needs and the principle of voluntary mutual benefit for different industries; all organizational units went through democratic consultation and formulated articles of association and systems. This has gradually led the mutual aid and cooperation organizations of small merchants and vendors to become sound.

　　After these small merchants and vendors organized and initially showed their superiority, some of the small merchants and vendors in the town who have not yet organized have taken the initiative to combine and requested to establish organizations. Small merchants and vendors from the two towns of Guli and Tongjing in this county have sent representatives to visit and inspect. Some local federations of industry and commerce have also written or called the supply and marketing cooperative, requesting help in organizing small merchants and vendors.

　　Recently, the Banqiao Town District Supply and Marketing Cooperative is further strengthening its leadership over the organized cooperative groups, helping them to gradually improve their management and consolidate their organizations. This is very necessary. Although rural small merchants and vendors are working people, they have been influenced by capitalist speculative business thinking for a long time, and the tendency to be selfish, self-interested, and opportunistic still exists. For example, the general merchandise group clearly wholesaled ten zhang of ribbon from Nanjing, but when they came to the cooperative to price it, they only reported eight zhang and four chi. Therefore, after small merchants and vendors are organized, they still need to go through a relatively long process of socialist transformation, and leadership must not be relaxed.

    小商小贩组织起来以后的板桥镇
    甄为民　史月娥
    在早晨约莫八点钟的时候，江苏省江宁县板桥镇就热闹起来了。街道两侧到处排列着蔬菜、鱼虾和其他农副产品的担子。在挂着“百货业经销小组”、“杂货业合作小组”、“面食业合作小组”等新招牌的一些店铺里，已经有人来来往往。在杂货合作小组的柜台旁边，一会儿来了买粉丝的农民，一会儿又来了买香烟、买面包的工人。百货经销小组的柜台旁，有买哨子的学校教师、有正在挑选生发油、袜子、毛巾的一群年青的农村姑娘。那些顾客神情满意，要买的东西都买到了，而且用不着排队。在市镇买卖开始的时候，两副油挑和八副货郎担已经分头出发到周围的凤雅、凤林等乡去了。他们给各乡农民送去日用必需品，换回旧铜、废铁、破布、烂棉花卖给供销合作社。农民们不再为一根针一根线跑到镇上来了。
    板桥镇一共有八十五户座商和四十五户摊贩。除了三户是商业资本家和一户是兼营商业的富农以外，其余全是小商、小贩。镇上没有国营商店，有一个区供销合作社，另外有铁、木、竹、缝纫等四个手工业合作小组。今年年初，供销合作社开始改造小商、小贩。现在已有四十五户组织起来，共成立了百货、屠宰二个经销小组，面食、杂货、豆腐、饭馆等四个合作小组，一户棉布经销店，一个有两副油挑和八副货郎担的货郎小组。
    因为组织起来方向正确、业务大、开支省，各个合作小组一月份的营业额比一九五四年十二月都上升了。因为实行了人员的合理分工，紧缩了开支，一月份有三个小组除去费用和工资外，还盈余一百一十元。同时，供销合作社一月份的营业额并没有下降，其中杂货比一九五四年十二月上升百分之三十；百货上升百分之四点一六；屠宰上升百分之七六点七五；而且增加了批发业务，每五天按照各经销小组和合作小组的进货计划批发一次货物。由于对小商、小贩进行了改造，供销合作社已经能够合理地布置农村商业网，便利农民买卖，减少了供销合作社的排队拥挤现象，使广大农民的经济生活恢复了正常状态，农村市场日趋活跃。
    今年年初以前，区供销合作社的干部对领导农村市场、全面安排农村私商的意义是认识不足的，在实际工作中放松了对他们的领导和照顾，因此，私商的零售额显著下降。加上一九五四年这个地区遭受了水灾，相继歇业和迁移的私商就有五十八户。这样，周围七乡一镇人民的供应任务就几乎全部落在区供销合作社的肩上。从一九五四年下半年开始，供销合作社的工作人员每天忙得不可开交，从油、盐、酱、菜到百货样样都得经营。乡、镇人民几乎每买一样东西都要排队。有许多东西，排了队也买不到。有些小商、小贩看到供销合作社缺货，就抬高价格出售。这样就破坏了农村正常的供应工作，造成了物资供应的某些紧张现象。同时，有二百多个小商、小贩，却因热货缺货、滞销品积压而闲得没事做。
    一九五四年十二月，中共板桥镇党委对党、政、工会、合作社、银行、税务所等有关单位的干部，进行了改造小商、小贩的意义和政策的教育。针对有些干部认为“小商、小贩不能种田，不能做工，因此不能算劳动人民”的看法，向他们说明小商、小贩是在商品流转过程中从事劳动的劳动者。在划清小商、小贩和商业资本家的界限，消除了干部对小商、小贩的敌对情绪以后，即着手进行了改造小商、小贩的工作。在进行这种改造工作的过程中，区供销合作社的部分干部对妥善安排私商的政策仍有怀疑，认为“让出的比重没有边”，发愁自己的经营计划完不成，不愿给组织起来的小组批货。区供销合作社供应组长祁大鸿事先知道本镇百货小组要批发钢针，可是当上级社发来两百包针时，却连忙调给了供销社的江宁、谷里分销处。百货经销小组长戴恒到他那里进货，跑了十趟，才进到一次货。区供销合作社领导方面发现了这些问题以后，又对干部进行了教育，说明通过批发业务领导私商，让他们担负一部分商品流转任务，只会加强社会主义商业在农村经济中的作用；又指出只要能正确估计市场需要，订出正确的供销计划，供销任务同样是能够完成的。这样一来，排挤小商、小贩的思想才得到纠正，改造工作得以顺利进行。
    小商、小贩经干部说明他们是劳动人民以后，一般都很兴奋。但他们对组织起来有许多顾虑，主要是怕大家在一起经营不好，怕自己吃亏。当地党、政领导机关和供销合作社通过小商、小贩代表座谈会，商民大会、小组会、家庭会和个别漫谈等方式，对他们进行了教育，使他们认清了自己应走的道路、前途以及组织起来的好处，这才提高了他们经营的积极性。在组织时，是根据社会需要和自愿互利的原则，按不同行业采取不同的组织形式；各组织单位都经过民主协商，制定了章程和制度。这样就使小商、小贩的互助合作组织逐步走向健全。
    这些小商、小贩组织起来、初步显示了优越性以后，目前镇上尚未组织起来的小商、小贩有些已主动结合，要求建立组织。这个县的谷里、铜井两个镇子的小商、小贩曾派代表来参观、访问。有些地方的工商业联合会也写信来或打电话给供销合作社，要求帮助把小商、小贩组织起来。
    最近，板桥镇区供销合作社正在进一步加强对已组织起来的合作小组的领导，帮助他们逐步改善经营管理，巩固组织。这是十分必要的。因为农村小商、小贩虽是劳动人民，但他们长期受资本主义投机经营思想的影响，自私自利、投机取巧的倾向还是存在的。如百货小组从南京批发来的带子明明是十丈，到合作社来标价时，却只报八丈四。因此，小商、小贩组织起来以后，还需要经过一个较长期的社会主义改造过程，绝不可以放松领导。
