The State-owned Shanghai Pharmaceutical Machinery Factory recently produced a batch of pill-making machines for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which have now been completely painted. This type of pill-making machine can be used both electrically and manually, so it can be used whether there is electricity or not, and can produce 25,000 pills per hour.

This pill-making machine is a new product trial-produced by the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Machinery Factory. In the process of design and manufacturing, there were many difficulties, but in order to support the Vietnamese people, the workers and technicians worked together to study and improve the machine, and finally completed the pill-making machine on March 22.

    为越南制造医药器械
    国营上海医药器械厂最近为越南民主共和国生产的一批制丸机，现在已经全部油漆好。这种制丸机是电动和手摇两用的，在有电或无电的地方都可以使用，每小时可生产二万五千粒药丸。
    这种制丸机是上海医药器械厂试制的新产品。在设计和制造过程中，曾有很多困难，但是为了支援越南人民，工人们和技术人员共同研究，改进了机器，终于在三月二十二日制成了制丸机。
