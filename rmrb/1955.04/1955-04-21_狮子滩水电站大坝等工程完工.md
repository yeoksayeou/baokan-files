The first low-water season project of the Shizitan Hydropower Station in Sichuan Province was completed at 11:00 AM on the 18th, twelve hours ahead of schedule. This will allow the hydropower station project to proceed according to the original plan and provide favorable conditions for power generation next year. Since last November, the hydropower station has entered the first low-water season construction phase. During the low-water period, six projects, including the river channel dam, had to be completed to eliminate the threat of flooding. These projects were large in scale, with a short construction period and complex technology. The amount of earth and stone excavated and concrete poured alone amounted to more than 180,000 cubic meters. During the construction, the workers launched a labor emulation campaign to improve production efficiency, continuously overfulfilling the state plan. More than 860 advanced producers and outstanding producers emerged, along with 18 advanced and winning teams. At the same time, about 300 outstanding producers gloriously joined the Communist Party of China and the Communist Youth League during their intense work. The construction also received support from all over the country and assistance from Soviet experts.

    狮子滩水电站大坝等工程完工
    四川省狮子滩水电站第一个枯水季节工程，已在十八日上午十一时提前十二小时完工。这样，水电站工程就能按原订计划进行，并给明年发电提供了有利的条件。从去年十一月以来，水电站就进入第一个枯水季节施工阶段。在枯水期内必须完成河漕大坝等六项工程，已摆脱洪水的威胁。这几项工程很大，施工时间短促，技术复杂，单是开挖的土石方和浇灌的混凝土就有十八万多方。施工中职工们开展了劳动竞赛，提高生产效率，不断超额完成国家计划，并涌现了八百六十多个先进生产者和优秀生产者，十八个先进和优胜班组；同时约有三百个优秀生产者在紧张的工作中光荣地参加了中国共产党和青年团。施工中也得到全国各地的支援和苏联专家的帮助。
