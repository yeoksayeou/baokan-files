Truth and Fallacy
Yu Ming

Any truth has its limits in actual application. If it is exaggerated and exceeds its actual applicable limits, it becomes a fallacy. This will not only fail to correctly guide people's thoughts and actions, but will also inevitably have side effects.

Let's take the issue of communist moral education for youth as an example.

There is no doubt that it is necessary and correct to conduct communist moral education for youth and cultivate noble ideals and qualities. In carrying out this work, it is undoubtedly necessary and correct to guide young people to clearly distinguish between the decadent thoughts of the bourgeoisie and the moral qualities of communism. However, in carrying out this work, it is necessary to conduct specific analysis of various specific ideological issues. Only through specific analysis can we distinguish the different nature of various issues and distinguish right from wrong. Needless to say, only in this way can we play a role in correctly educating young people.

However, such things have already happened in some places. For example, a certain organization had several young people whose attitudes towards love were not serious enough. In response to this problem, it is perfectly appropriate and necessary to conduct communist moral education for young people, guiding them to deal with love, marriage, and family issues with the correct attitude. However, this organization did not conduct any specific analysis, but simply gave them a general dressing down on the "issue of male-female relationships," and the effect was very bad. Some other organizations do not specifically analyze what constitutes corrupt and degenerate thoughts and behaviors, but arbitrarily label people. As a result, not only did they fail to help young people clearly understand which are corrupt and degenerate thoughts and behaviors and which are general shortcomings in life, but they blurred the boundaries and confused right and wrong, leaving everyone at a loss, even making people feel that they have to consider whether even lifting a foot or making a move might invite criticism.

Generally speaking, young people are relatively simple and easily accept new things; but because they lack experience and have weak discernment abilities, they are also easily influenced by some erroneous ideas. Therefore, in the process of conducting communist moral education for them, all their erroneous ideas must be specifically analyzed, pointing out the different nature and degree of harm of various erroneous ideas, raising their awareness and discernment ability, and explaining methods of correction and prevention. This is the active and correct attitude. Otherwise, if we do not analyze any problem, negate everything, and arbitrarily label people, this will neither help them clarify ideological issues nor achieve any educational purpose.

Comrade Mao Zedong once said in his article "Oppose Party Stereotypes": "The Communist Party does not rely on intimidation to make a living, but on the truth of Marxism-Leninism, on seeking truth from facts, and on science." I think it would be very beneficial to seriously review this passage when conducting communist moral education for young people. Because this passage is not only an important admonition for those who do not treat young people's ideological styles with the correct attitude and who often exaggerate the truth, but also a mirror for them.

    真理和谬论
    愚明
    任何真理，都有它实际上所能应用的限度。如果把它说过了火，超出了它实际上所能应用的限度，那就变成谬论了。这就不但不能正确地指导人们的思想行动，而且一定还会发生副作用。
    现在就拿对青年进行共产主义道德教育的问题来说吧。
    向青年进行共产主义道德教育，培养青年具有高尚的理想和高贵的品质，毫无疑义，是必需的、正确的。在进行这项工作中，指导青年划分清楚哪是资产阶级的腐朽思想，哪是共产主义的道德品质，毫无疑义，也是必需的、正确的。但在进行这项工作中，必须对各种不同的具体思想问题进行具体的分析。只有进行具体的分析，才可以区别出各种不同问题的不同性质，分清是非。不待说，也只有这样，才能起到正确教育青年的作用。
    可是，现在有的地方已经发生了这样的事情。如有一个机关有几个青年在恋爱问题上的态度不够严肃。针对着这个问题，向青年进行共产主义的道德品质教育，指导他们以正确的态度来处理恋爱、婚姻和家庭问题，自然是完全应该和完全必要的。但这个机关并没有经过什么具体的分析，只笼统地整了他们一顿“男女关系问题”，效果很坏。还有的机关不去具体分析什么是腐化堕落的思想行为，乱扣帽子。结果，不但没有帮助青年明确认识哪些是腐化堕落的思想行为，哪些是生活中的一般缺点，反而弄得界限不清、是非不明，使大家都无所适从，甚至，使人感到就是抬腿动脚，也不能不考虑考虑是否会引来什么非议。
    一般青年都是比较单纯，容易接受新鲜事物的；但由于他们缺乏经验，鉴别能力不强，也容易受一些错误思想的影响。因此，在向他们进行共产主义道德教育的过程中，对于他们的一切错误思想，必须多作具体分析，指出各种不同错误思想的不同性质及其危害程度，提高他们的觉悟和鉴别能力，说明改正和提防的方法，才是积极的、正确的态度。否则对于任何问题都不加分析，否定一切，乱扣帽子，这就既不能帮助他们弄清楚思想问题，也不能达到任何教育的目的。
    毛泽东同志在“反对党八股”一文中曾说过：“共产党不靠吓人吃饭，而是靠马克思列宁主义的真理吃饭，靠实事求是吃饭，靠科学吃饭。”我想，在对青年进行共产主义道德教育工作的时候，认真温习一下这一段话，是极有好处的。因为这一段话，对于那些不以正确的态度去对待青年的思想作风问题，往往把真理说过了火的人，不仅是一个重要的告诫，而且是他们的一面镜子。
