Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Due to the dissatisfaction of ordinary Labour Party members with the right-wing leaders' policies of supporting the rearmament of West Germany and accelerating the atomic arms race, the divisions within the Labour Party have greatly increased recently. Right-wing leaders attempted to intimidate members who opposed their policies and suppress criticism of these policies by expelling Bevan from the Labour Party parliamentary group, in order to avoid a split within the party. However, this trick by the right-wing leaders had the opposite effect. Many local Labour Party organizations and trade unions issued statements expressing dissatisfaction with the right-wing leaders' trick.

The British Labour Party National Executive Committee held a meeting for more than three hours on March 23 to discuss Bevan's party membership. Attlee had to suggest postponing the decision on expelling Bevan. The National Executive Committee ultimately passed a compromise resolution by a vote of 14 to 13: to appoint a special committee to talk to Bevan, to try to get him to give assurances about his "behavior" as a member in the future, and to submit a report on the results of the talk to the National Executive Committee.

By March 30, the British Labour Party National Executive Committee held a secret meeting, at which it passed a decision by a vote of 16 to 10 (with two abstentions) not to expel Bevan.

Reuters said that some political figures in London believe that this decision shows that Labour leaders "admit they dare not expel Bevan" because doing so would "cause the Labour Party to disintegrate nationwide as the election approaches."

    英国工党全国执行委员会
    通过决定不开除比万党籍
    据新华社讯　由于工党普通党员不满右翼领袖们支持政府的重新武装西德和加速原子军备竞赛的政策，近来工党内部的分歧大大增加了。右翼领袖们企图用开除比万出工党议会党团的办法来恐吓反对他们的政策的党员和压制对这种政策的批评，以避免党内分裂。但是，右翼领袖的这种诡计产生了相反的效果。很多工党地方组织和工会都发表声明，对右翼领袖的诡计表示不满。
    英国工党全国执行委员会在三月二十三日开了一次三小时以上的会议，来讨论比万的党籍问题。艾德礼不得不建议延期作出关于开除比万党籍的决定。全国执行委员会结果以十四票对十三票通过了一个折衷决议：任命一个特别委员会来同比万谈话，设法使他对今后作为一个党员的“行为”作出保证，并且就谈话结果向全国执行委员会提出报告。
    到三月三十日，英国工党全国执行委员会举行秘密会议，会上以十六票对十票（两票弃权）通过了不开除比万党籍的决定。
    路透社说，伦敦某些政界人士认为，这个决定表明工党领袖们“承认他们不敢开除比万”，因为这样一来就会“在选举临近的时候在全国引起工党的分崩离析”。
