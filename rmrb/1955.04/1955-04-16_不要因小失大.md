Don't Penny-Pinch and Lose Dollars
    Cai Dejing

    Currently, there are two methods for processing vegetable oilseeds: one is to determine the oil yield through negotiation between the processing unit and the processing plant based on the average technical conditions in each region, and implement a progressive tiered bonus system. That is, in addition to delivering oil according to the contractually specified quota, bonuses are awarded based on the amount of excess, with larger excesses receiving higher bonuses and smaller excesses receiving smaller bonuses. This method can encourage processing plants to improve technology, increase oil yield, and conserve oilseeds.

    The other method is to calculate processing fees based on the quantity of oilseeds, without increasing or decreasing the processing plant's income regardless of the oil yield. Adopting this method will encourage the waste of oilseeds. Some processing plants, in order to earn more processing fees, single-mindedly pursue the quantity of raw materials pressed, while neglecting to improve the oil yield.

    In order to overcome the waste of oilseeds and strive to produce more oil with the same amount of oilseeds, so as to better meet the needs of the people, adopting the former processing method is very correct. The relevant departments, such as the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Local Industry, and the Ministry of Commerce, signed an agreement at the beginning of this year, stipulating that this processing method should be implemented from January of this year.

    However, some units still do not implement this regulation and instead adopt the method of actual production and actual delivery without bonuses. The reason for this is that, on the processing plant side, they mainly believe that this way they can easily obtain more processing fees; on the oil company and grain bureau side, some emphasize the urgency of processing tasks and do not have time to improve the oil yield; others believe that the processing method prescribed by the higher authorities only applies to large cities and large oil factories, while calculating the oil yield for small oil mills in small cities and towns is too troublesome and inconvenient to implement. Regardless of the reason, it is all for the sake of making small calculations for their own units—some are making calculations for "money," and some are making calculations for "convenience," but no one has calculated the benefits of producing more oil for the country and the people, that is to say, no one has made calculations for the country and the people.

    The National Oil Industry Advanced Experience Exchange Conference in November 1954 estimated that if the national average oil yield of vegetable oil is increased by 1% to 2%, then in 1955 alone, 200 million jin of edible oil can be produced with the same amount of oilseeds. Based on an average of six jin of oil per person per year, it can feed more than 33 million people for a year. Compared with the little extra processing fees earned by an enterprise or the little extra trouble for some enterprise employees, which is more important? Therefore, those who are truly good at calculating must be those who have a global perspective, so that they will not penny-pinch and lose dollars. In order to complete and overfulfill the plan to increase the production of 200 million jin of edible oil, the progressive tiered bonus processing method must be earnestly implemented in all provinces, cities, counties, and towns!

    不要因小失大

    目前有两种植物油料加工办法：一种是根据各地的中等技术条件，由加工单位和加工厂协商确定出油率，并实行超额累进提成奖励办法，即除按合同规定的定额交油以外，超额部分按超额多的多提成、超额少的少提成的原则给以奖励。这个办法可以鼓励加工工厂改进技术，提高出油率，节约油料。
    另一种办法是以油料数量计算加工费，不管出油率高或低，都不增减加工工厂的收入。采取这种办法，就会助长油料的浪费。有些加工工厂为了多得加工费，片面追求压榨原料的数量，而忽视提高出油率。
    为了克服油料的浪费现象，争取用同等数量的油料生产更多的油脂，更好地满足人民的需要，采取前一种加工办法是非常正确的。轻工业部、地方工业部、商业部等有关部门，在今年年初签订了一项协定，规定从今年一月份起实行这种加工办法。
    可是，有些单位至今仍不执行这种规定，而采取实产实交、没有奖励的办法。追究原因，在加工厂方面主要是以为这样可以轻易地获得更多的加工费；在油脂公司、粮食局方面，有的强调加工任务紧，顾不上提高出油率；有的则认为上级规定的加工办法只适用于大城市大油厂，至于小城小镇的小油坊，计算出油率太麻烦，不便执行。不论是哪一种理由，为的都是打本单位的小算盘——有的是打“钱”的算盘，有的是打“方便不方便”的算盘，可是谁也没有计算多出一些油脂对国家对人民的好处，也就是说，没有为国家和人民打打算盘。
    一九五四年十一月全国油脂工业先进经验交流大会估计，如果全国植物油脂的出油率平均提高百分之一到百分之二，则一九五五年一年就可以用同等数量的油料增产两亿斤食油。每人每年按六斤油计算，可以给三千三百多万人吃一年。这和一个企业多得的一点加工费或一些企业职工多一点麻烦相比，究竟是谁轻谁重呢？因此，真正会打算盘的人，必须是有全局观点的人，才不会因小失大。为了完成和超额完成增产两亿斤食油计划，必须在各省、市、县、镇切实贯彻超额累进提成奖励的加工办法！
