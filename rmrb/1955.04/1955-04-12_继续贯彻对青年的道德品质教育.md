Continue to Implement Moral Education for Youth
Liu Daosheng

Since the winter of 1954, the issue of conducting communist moral education for youth and opposing the erosion of bourgeois ideology has attracted great attention from local Party committees, Communist Youth League committees, and various sectors of society. Currently, the Communist Youth League committees in most provinces and large and medium-sized cities across the country have conducted investigations and research, put forward plans, and some cities are steadily carrying them out. A few have even come to a conclusion, gaining preliminary experience. The recent Second Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the Communist Youth League conducted a detailed study on the issue of communist education for youth. These have prepared favorable conditions for continuing to carry out this work in the future.

Judging from the cities where centralized publicity and education have been carried out, generally good results have been achieved. The youth have generally gained a preliminary understanding of the harm of bourgeois ideological erosion and the remnants of old social ideas, heightened their vigilance, stimulated their desire to improve, improved labor discipline and study discipline, improved public life order, and greatly reduced the number of people who read reactionary, obscene, and absurd books and frequented vulgar entertainment venues. People from all sectors of society, especially parents and teachers, have paid attention to the issue of moral education for youth, and recognized that they bear an important responsibility for the moral education of their children and students. The grassroots organizations of the Communist Youth League have begun to pay attention to carrying out work among the surrounding youth, especially the backward youth, and have thus more deeply realized the importance of caring about the lives of the masses, meeting the special needs of the youth, and improving their own work style.

It can be seen that the effect of this education is widespread. At present, it is completely correct and necessary to conduct a centralized communist moral education for youth in large and medium-sized cities. This is not only of great significance for cultivating and educating the younger generation and promoting a new social moral atmosphere, but also plays an active role in current work.

However, from a national perspective, due to the lack of experience in this work, the development of the work is still very uneven: some have clear guidelines, policies, requirements, and steps, and under the unified leadership of the Party, concentrate the strength of all relevant parties, after full deliberation, with division of responsibilities and close cooperation. The result of doing so is consistent understanding, in-depth work, greater impact, and profound results. Some, due to the lack of centralized and unified leadership and insufficient cooperation with relevant parties, have formed the Youth League operating alone, resulting in little effect. A few cities are still at the stage of making general research and appeals, without actively leading and cooperating with relevant parties to make specific arrangements, resulting in some grassroots spontaneous actions, causing some confusion and arousing public dissatisfaction. These cities should take active and concrete steps to catch up.

Strengthening communist moral education for youth and opposing the erosion of bourgeois ideology is a relatively complex and meticulous task. In order to implement this task steadily and effectively, the following issues still need to be clarified:

First, we should understand the purpose and requirements of strengthening moral education for youth and resisting the erosion of bourgeois ideology.

It should be clearly pointed out that the task of the Communist Youth League is to carry out communist education for the younger generation. The content of communist education is very rich, including: intellectual education, moral education, physical education, aesthetic education, and comprehensive technical education, which are the fundamental methods for comprehensively developing youth and making them a new generation for building and defending the motherland. These five aspects are of course interrelated and indispensable, but what is the central purpose? As Lenin pointed out in "The Tasks of the Youth Leagues": "It is necessary to ensure that the entire cause of education, training, and cultivation of modern youth becomes the cause of cultivating communist morality among youth." Therefore, cultivating youth with communist moral qualities and making them useful talents for socialism is a central issue.

Since liberation, we have conducted patriotic and internationalist education against imperialism for youth, democratic education against feudalism, and since the proposal of the Party's general line, we have conducted socialist future education for youth, which has basically clarified the direction of progress for youth. Now we propose to strengthen moral education for youth and oppose the erosion of bourgeois ideology precisely to deepen our political and ideological education and lay the foundation for more comprehensive and systematic communist education for youth in the future. Therefore, the purpose and requirements of this education are relatively focused and limited, and it is impossible to solve all problems related to opposing the influence of bourgeois ideology in a short period of time. Specifically, through this centralized publicity and education, the following points should generally be achieved:

(1) Educate youth to recognize the ugliness of bourgeois ideology, raise vigilance, and strengthen the consciousness of moral cultivation. The reason why we want to expose the typical cases of a few youth who are eroded by bourgeois ideology is precisely to sound the alarm for the vast number of youth; expose the harm of professional hooligans, illegal capitalists, vulgar entertainment venues, and reactionary, obscene, and absurd books and periodicals, educate youth to clarify the boundaries between right and wrong, initially recognize new moral standards, and determine the direction of their efforts, rather than oppose the youth who have been poisoned.

(2) Arouse all sectors of society to pay attention to moral education for youth. Before this issue was raised, theft, hooliganism, corruption, and degeneration of certain youth were not non-existent, but the problem was that we had not paid attention or paid very little attention in the past. Now, if we do not raise this issue again, it will be very harmful to our country's construction cause, and we will make mistakes in our work. And to carry out communist moral education for youth, the Communist Youth League undoubtedly has an unshirkable responsibility, but it is by no means a task that the Communist Youth League can independently undertake. It must be carried out jointly with relevant government departments, various people's organizations, schools, and all parents.

(3) Actively assist relevant government departments in cracking down on professional hooligans, bandits, and illegal capitalists, and gradually transform bad bookstores and book stalls. According to the situation reflected by various places, the decadent behavior of youth and adolescents is inseparable from the lure of the above-mentioned remnants of the old society. The organizations of the Communist Youth League must assist relevant government departments to solve this problem, otherwise it will be impossible to eliminate their poisoning of youth and adolescents.

(4) Improve the work style of the Communist Youth League, enrich the independent work content of the Communist Youth League, and closely connect with the vast number of youth. Mainly, the organizations of the Communist Youth League should care about the lives and demands of youth, carry out mass amateur cultural activities, strengthen work in units with weak work, social youth, and backward youth, and strengthen ideological education for youth. If we only pay attention to the first three points and neglect this one, then the excitement will pass quickly, and the achievements will not be consolidated. Therefore, we must combine the inspection of the shortcomings of our work and propose practical and feasible measures to further improve our work.

Overcoming the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie is a long-term and arduous task, which requires constant attention to education and cannot be rushed. Therefore, it is impossible to solve many problems in this concentrated publicity and education, and some problems cannot be solved thoroughly for a while. When carrying out work, all localities should proceed from reality, grasp the key points, and not demand too much or be too impatient. This must be paid attention to.

Second, this education should be carried out under the unified leadership of the Party committee and in conjunction with the central work.

Conducting communist moral education for youth is not only a complex and meticulous task, but also involves many other aspects of the problem. At the same time, it needs to be carried out centrally in a short period of time to achieve good results. Therefore, it must be carried out under the unified leadership of the Party committee, concentrating the strength of all parties, in a prepared and step-by-step manner. Especially at the grassroots level, the Party committee needs to arrange time in a unified way, organize forces, and cooperate with the central work to achieve the expected results. The organizations of the Communist Youth League should actively collect materials, actively report the situation to the Party committee, and make suggestions.

Making full preparations is an important condition to ensure the in-depth development of this moral education. If detailed investigation and research are carried out in advance to find out the main problems existing in the actual life of youth, select good typical examples, and the cadres' ideological deliberation is mature, the entire work can be carried out steadily and forcefully. Conversely, if the leadership is ignorant, the cadres are not clear about the principles, policies, purposes, and requirements, and the work is carried out rashly, the education will not be profound, and even some confusion may be caused.

According to current experience, when starting publicity and education, it should start with exposing one or two representative examples of being corrupted by bourgeois ideology in the local area, combined with the explanation of communist moral standards, and organize youth to launch discussions. This can make the vast number of youth more closely aware of the harm of bourgeois ideology and more forcefully arouse the attention of all sectors of society. However, large and medium-sized cities should not choose too many bad examples, and general grassroots organizations should not find their own examples. The selected examples should be approved by the city's leadership before they can be organized for discussion among the masses. While criticizing bad examples, we should also pay attention to publishing more examples of transformation and praising advanced ideas and advanced deeds among youth, guiding youth from a positive aspect.

Corruption, degeneration, and hooliganism are always the problems of a few people among the youth, but as far as opposing the erosion of bourgeois ideology is concerned, it is by no means an individual problem of some people. Therefore, in the process of education, it is necessary to combine the major problems that are common among the youth, such as theft, embezzlement, waste, destruction of labor discipline and study discipline, to carry out critical education, so as to educate the majority of youth in order to better complete the central work.

In the process of publicity and education, it is necessary to repeatedly explain the policies to cadres, activists, and the broad masses, making it clear that what should be cracked down on are professional hooligans, not everyone who has hooligan behavior. The latter should only be criticized and educated. The entire work should be carried out with leadership, planning, and steps to prevent spontaneous action. Those who conduct self-criticism on a conscious basis after education should be welcomed and encouraged to correct, and should never be forced or launch the masses to conduct denunciations and struggles. Personal hobbies and lifestyle details that do not hinder collective interests should not be criticized as bourgeois ideology, especially legitimate love relationships between men and women should not be discriminated against and opposed. And certain feudal views in people's minds should be appropriately criticized, because these are also fundamentally incompatible with communist moral concepts.

Third, after concentrated education, attention should be paid to regularly implementing it on the basis of this work.

This time, conducting more concentrated communist moral education for youth in a certain period of time is mainly to lay the foundation for further conducting communist education in the future. Therefore, the working time should generally not be too long. According to existing experience, except for preparatory work, the general city can come to an end in one or two months, otherwise delaying the time will affect other work.

After basically achieving the above requirements, the organizations of the Communist Youth League should immediately conduct a serious summary, use the summary to further educate the youth, and study how to improve future work in order to consolidate existing achievements and regularly implement them.

After the time of concentrated education has passed, it does not mean the end of moral education for youth, but this work should be regarded as one of the regular educational contents. The Youth League organizations in various places should especially make plans for further strengthening communist education for youth according to the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the Youth League, and specifically implement them. And pay attention to combining the "Outline of Internal Labor Regulations for State-Owned Enterprises" promulgated by the former Government Council and the student code to carry out education to improve the youth's awareness. Regularly praise good people and good deeds, oppose bad people and bad deeds, cultivate a climate of criticism and self-criticism and opposition to all bad phenomena within the League and among the broad masses of youth, care for and guide the lives of youth, and continue to strengthen communist moral education for youth and resist the erosion of bourgeois ideology.

Now, we have achieved considerable achievements and preliminary experience in conducting moral education for youth, which is a very favorable condition. The Youth League organizations in large and medium-sized cities that are preparing to carry out this work should work hard on this basis, strengthen supervision and inspection, continue to implement it, and strive to make greater achievements in the first half of this year to advance the work of the Youth League.

    继续贯彻对青年的道德品质教育
    刘导生
    自一九五四年冬季以来，对青年进行共产主义道德教育、反对资产阶级思想侵蚀的问题，引起了各地党委、团委及社会各方面的很大重视。目前全国大多数省及大、中城市的团委已经进行了调查研究、提出了计划，部分城市正在稳步地开展，少数并已告一段落，取得了初步经验。最近召开的青年团中央二届二次全体会议对青年的共产主义教育问题作了详细的研究。这些都给今后继续开展这一工作，准备了有利的条件。
    根据已经集中地进行过宣传教育的城市来看，一般都收到了良好的效果。青年们大都已初步认识了资产阶级思想侵蚀及旧社会思想遗毒的危害性，提高了警惕，激发了上进的要求，劳动纪律、学习纪律有了改进，公共生活秩序有所改善，看反动、淫秽、荒诞书刊和跑下流娱乐场所的人数已大大减少。社会各方面的人们，尤其是家长、教师都已重视了青年的品德教育问题，认识到自己对子女、学生的道德教育负有重要的责任。青年团的基层组织开始注意了对周围的青年进行工作，特别是对青年中的落后部分进行工作，从而也更加体会到应当关心群众生活，满足青年的特殊要求，改进自己的工作作风的重要意义。
    由此可见，这一教育的效果是广泛的。目前在大、中城市内，集中地对青年进行一次共产主义道德教育，是完全正确和必要的。这不仅对培养和教育青年一代、发扬新的社会道德风气有着重要的意义，而且对于当前工作也起着积极的作用。
    但就全国来看，由于对这一工作缺乏经验，工作的发展还是很不平衡的：有的方针、政策、要求、步骤明确，在党的统一领导下，集中各有关方面的力量，经过充分酝酿，分工负责，密切配合。这样做的结果是认识一致，工作深入，影响较大，收效深刻。有的由于缺乏集中统一的领导，与有关方面配合不够密切，形成团在单独作战，因而收效不大。还有少数城市目前尚停留在作一般的研究和号召，而不积极领导和配合有关方面作具体部署，以致有的基层自发行动，造成某些混乱，引起群众不满。这些城市应该采取积极的、具体的步骤，迎头赶上。
    加强对青年的共产主义道德教育，反对资产阶级思想的侵蚀，是一项比较复杂和细致的工作。为着稳妥和有效地贯彻这一任务，目前还须明确以下几个问题：
    首先，应了解加强对青年的道德教育、抵制资产阶级思想侵蚀的目的和要求。
    应当明确指出，青年团的任务是对青年一代进行共产主义教育。共产主义教育的内容是非常丰富的，它包括：智育、德育、体育、美育、综合技术教育等五个方面，这也是使青年全面发展，成为建设祖国和保卫祖国新的一代的根本方法。这五个方面当然都是互相联系的，不可偏废的，但中心的目的又是什么呢？正如列宁在“青年团底任务”中所指出的：“应该做到使教育、训练和培养现代青年的全部事业，都成为在青年中养成共产主义道德的事业。”因此，培养青年具有共产主义的道德品质，成为社会主义的有用人材，这就是一个中心的问题。
    解放以来，我们对青年进行了反对帝国主义的爱国主义教育和国际主义教育，反对封建主义的民主教育，自从党的总路线提出后，更对青年进行了社会主义的前途教育，使青年基本上明确了前进的方向。现在我们提出加强对青年的道德教育、反对资产阶级思想的侵蚀，正是为了使我们的政治思想教育深入一步，并为今后更加全面系统地展开对青年的共产主义教育打下基础。因此，这次教育的目的和要求是比较集中的、也是有限度的，不可能要求在短时期内解决有关反对资产阶级思想影响的一切问题。具体来说，通过这次集中的宣传教育，一般应达到以下几点：
    （一）教育青年认识资产阶级思想的丑恶，提高警惕，加强道德修养的自觉性。我们所以要揭发少数受资产阶级思想侵蚀的青年中的典型事例，其目的正是为了向广大青年敲起警钟；揭露职业流氓、不法资本家、下流娱乐场所及反动、淫秽、荒诞的书刊的危害性，教育青年明确是非界限，初步认识新的道德标准，确定自己努力的方向，而不是去反对被毒害的青年。
      （二）引起社会各方面对青年进行道德教育的重视。在这个问题提出以前，某些青年的偷窃、流氓行为、腐化堕落等并不是不存在，问题是我们过去没有注意或很少注意。现在如果我们再不提出这个问题，对我们的国家建设事业就有很大危害，我们就要在工作中犯错误。而对青年进行共产主义道德教育，青年团固然责无旁贷，但决不是青年团所能独立担当的任务，必须同政府有关部门、各人民团体、学校及所有的家长来共同进行这一工作。
      （三）积极协助政府有关部门打击职业流氓、盗匪和不法资本家，逐步改造坏的书店、书摊。根据各地所反映的情况看来，青年和少年的堕落行为，是跟上述这些旧社会的遗毒的勾引分不开的。青年团的组织必须协助政府有关部门加以解决，否则就不可能消除他们对青年和少年的毒害。
      （四）改进青年团的工作作风，丰富青年团的独立工作内容，密切同广大青年的联系。主要是青年团的组织应当关心青年的生活和要求，开展群众业余文化活动，加强对工作薄弱单位、社会青年和落后青年的工作，加强对青年的思想教育。如果我们只注意前三条，而忽视了这一条，那末热闹一阵就会过去了，成绩也是不可能巩固的。因此必须结合检查我们工作的缺点，提出切实可行的措施，进一步改进我们的工作。
    克服资产阶级的思想影响，这是一个长期而艰巨的工作，要靠经常注意进行教育，而不能操之过急。因此在这次集中进行宣传教育中，不可能解决很多问题，有些问题一时也不可能解决得很透。各地在进行工作时应从实际出发，抓住重点，不能要求过高过急。这是必须引起注意的。
    第二，这次教育应当在党委的统一领导下，结合中心工作进行。
    对青年进行共产主义道德教育不仅是一项复杂和细致的工作，而且还牵涉到其他许多方面的问题，同时又需要在一个短时期内集中地进行一次教育，才能收到良好的效果。因此，必须在党委统一领导下，集中各方面的力量，有准备、有步骤地进行。特别在基层中，更需党委统一安排时间，组织力量，配合中心工作进行，才能达到预期的效果。而青年团的组织则应当主动地收集材料，积极向党委反映情况，提出建议。
    充分地做好准备，是保证深入开展这一次道德教育的重要条件，凡是事先经过详细的调查研究，摸清青年实际生活中所存在的主要问题，选择好典型，干部思想酝酿成熟，整个工作就能开展得稳妥而有力。反之，如果领导上心中无数，干部对方针、政策、目的、要求还不明确，便草率开展工作，教育就不会深刻，甚至可能造成某些混乱。
    根据目前经验，开始进行宣传教育时，应从揭发本地一两个有代表性的被资产阶级思想腐蚀的典型入手，结合共产主义道德标准的讲解，组织青年展开讨论，这样就可以使广大青年更亲切地认识资产阶级思想的危害性、更有力地引起社会各方面的重视。但是各大、中城市选择坏典型不宜太多，一般的基层组织不要自己去找典型。选择的典型，应经过市的领导批准后，才能在群众中组织讨论。在批判坏典型的同时，还应注意更多地发表一些转变的典型及表扬青年中的先进思想、先进事迹，从积极方面引导青年。
    腐化堕落和流氓行为在青年中总是少数人的问题，但作为反对资产阶级思想侵蚀来说，决不是某些人的个别问题。因此，在教育过程中必须联系当前青年中带有普遍性的重大问题，如偷窃、贪污、浪费、破坏劳动纪律和学习纪律等进行批判教育，这样才能教育大多数青年，以更好地完成中心工作。
    在宣传教育过程中要向干部、积极分子以及广大群众反复交代政策，说清要打击的是职业流氓，而不是一切有流氓行为的人，对后者只应进行批评教育。整个工作应当有领导、有计划、有步骤地进行，防止自发行动。对于经过教育在自觉的基础上进行检讨者应表示欢迎，鼓励改正，而绝对不可追逼，也不应发动群众进行检举和斗争。对属于个人爱好和习惯的生活细节，只要不妨碍集体利益，都不应当作为资产阶级思想去批判，特别是男女间正当的恋爱关系，更不应当受到歧视和反对。而对于某些人们头脑中的封建观点则应加以适当批判，因为这些同样是同共产主义道德观念根本不相容的。
    第三，在集中地进行教育之后，应注意在这一工作基础上经常加以贯彻。
    这一次在一定时间内较集中地向青年进行共产主义道德教育，主要是为今后进一步进行共产主义教育打下基础。因此，进行工作的时间一般不应过长，根据已有的经验，除准备工作外，一般的市有一两个月的时间即可告一段落，否则拖延时间就会影响其他工作。
    在基本上达到上述要求之后，青年团的组织应即认真地进行一次总结，通过总结来进一步教育青年，并研究如何改进今后的工作，以巩固现有的成绩，经常加以贯彻。
    集中教育的时间过后，并不等于对青年进行道德教育的结束，而应把这一工作当做经常的教育内容之一。各地团的组织特别应当根据团的二届二中全会的精神，对进一步加强青年的共产主义教育作出计划，具体地加以贯彻。并注意结合前政务院颁布的“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”以及学生守则等进行教育，以提高青年的觉悟。经常表扬好人好事，反对坏人坏事，在团内和在广大青年中养成批评和自我批评及反对一切不良现象的风气，关心及指导青年的生活，来继续加强对青年的共产主义道德教育，抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀。
    现在，我们对青年进行道德品质教育已取得了相当成绩和初步经验，这是一个很有利的条件，正在准备进行这一工作的大中城市的青年团组织，应在这个基础上努力工作，加强督促检查，继续贯彻，争取今年上半年做出更大的成绩，使青年团的工作前进一步。
