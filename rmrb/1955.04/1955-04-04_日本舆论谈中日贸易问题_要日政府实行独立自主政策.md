Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 3rd: Japanese public opinion demands that the Hatoyama government implement an independent and autonomous policy on Sino-Japanese trade issues.

　　The "Saga Shimbun" published an editorial on March 30th stating that the Japanese government should not be at the beck and call of the United States on Sino-Japanese trade issues. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" on March 28th also believed that Japan needs strong independent diplomacy in Sino-Japanese trade.

　　The "Yamanashi Jiji Shimbun" published an article on March 28th entitled "Only Sino-Japanese Trade Offers a Way Out," demanding that the Japanese government treat the Chinese trade delegation visiting Japan with sincerity. The "Yamagata Shimbun" said that if the Japanese government looks around hesitantly on the issue of improving relations with China and the Soviet Union and does not work hard to develop Sino-Japanese relations, then even if the Chinese trade delegation comes to Japan, it will not achieve much. The newspaper pointed out that how the Japanese government will achieve independent diplomacy is currently facing an important test.

    日本舆论谈中日贸易问题
    要日政府实行独立自主政策
    新华社东京三日电　日本舆论要求鸠山政府在中日贸易问题上实行独立自主的政策。
      “佐贺新闻”三月三十日发表社论说，日本政府在中日贸易问题上不应仰美国的鼻息。三月二十八日的“读卖新闻”也认为，在中日贸易方面，日本需要有强有力的自主外交。
    “山梨时事新闻”三月二十八日以“只有日中贸易才有出路”为题发表文章，要求日本政府要以诚意来对待中国访问日本贸易代表团。“山形新闻”说，如果日本政府在改善同中国和苏联的关系问题上左顾右盼，不努力于发展中日关系，那么，虽然中国贸易代表团来到日本，也不能收到多大效果。这家报纸指出，日本政府如何实现自主外交，目前正面临着重要的考验。
