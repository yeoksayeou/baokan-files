    Electric Meter and Instrument Factory Begins Construction This Year
    The civil engineering work for the Harbin Electric Meter and Instrument Factory began on April 1st this year. The workers participating in the construction of the factory submitted letters of determination, guaranteeing to complete the national key project construction plan well, economically, quickly, and safely.
    This year is a peak construction year for the Harbin Electric Meter and Instrument Factory, with the state requiring that all factory construction be basically completed by the end of the year. This year's civil engineering includes factory buildings, office buildings, employee housing, schools, factory gardens, and various pipeline and road projects. Among them, Factory Building No. 2 is the focus of this year's construction. Various precision electric meters and instruments produced by the factory for industrial, automotive, and scientific research institutions will be assembled here.
    Because the construction task is heavy this year, the factory is paying special attention to establishing the idea of "a century-long plan, quality first" among all construction personnel. The construction department has also made a plan of measures to ensure project quality.

    电表仪器厂今年工程开始施工
    哈尔滨电表仪器厂今年的土木建筑工程已在四月一日开始施工。参加建厂的工人们提出了决心书，保证要又好又省又快又安全地完成国家重点工程的建设计划。
    今年是哈尔滨电表仪器厂进入施工高潮的一年，国家要求全部建厂工程到年底基本完工。今年的土木建筑工程包括厂房、办公大楼、职工住宅、学校和厂区花园以及各种管道和道路工程等。其中二号厂房是今年施工工程的重点。工厂出产的供工业、汽车和科学研究机关使用的各种精密的电表仪器都将在这里装配。
    因为今年施工任务繁重，这个厂特别注意在全体建设人员中树立“百年大计，质量第一”的思想。施工部门也做了保证工程质量的措施计划。
