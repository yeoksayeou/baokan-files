The Dai people of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province celebrated the 1317th Dai New Year - Jing Bi Mai. On the first day of the festival, "Sangha Bai" (April 14th), cadres from various agencies in Yun Jinghong, the seat of the Autonomous Region People's Government, held a New Year's greeting. In the afternoon, dragon boat races were held on the Lancang River. Four narrow, light boats, driven by more than 140 sailors, sped up and down the rapid river. More than two thousand spectators dressed in festive costumes stood on the beach, constantly cheering: "Water (meaning good)! Water!". A boat from Jingdai won the prize flag.

During the three days of the festival, minority cadres working in various agencies were given leave. The People's Governments of Banna Jinghong, Banna Mengyang, Banna Menglong and other Banna areas organized celebrations with hundreds of people respectively. Various collective activities were held in all 670+ Dai villages in the region.

On the third day of the festival, villages such as Manjinglan in Banna Jinghong jointly set off fireworks, danced, sang, and drank in celebration. Ai Wen, a farmer from Manjinglan, said: "Since the Communist Party came, our New Year celebrations have become more and more joyous." The Autonomous Region Nationalities Cultural Troupe and film and slide projector teams toured villages such as Ga Sa, Man Fei Long, and Jing Dai during the festival.

    傣族人民欢庆傣历新年
    云南省西双版纳傣族自治区的傣族人民，欢度第一三一七次傣历新年——京比迈。节日的第一天“桑哈摆”（四月十四日），自治区人民政府所在地允景洪的各机关干部举行了团拜。下午，在澜沧江中举行赛龙船，由一百四十多名水手驾驶的四张狭长的轻舟，在湍急的江心上下疾驶。沙滩上伫立着两千多个穿着节日服装的观众，不住的欢呼：“水（好的意思）！水！”。来自景岱的一张船获得了奖旗。
    节日的三天里，在各机关工作的少数民族干部都放了假。版纳景洪、版纳勐养、版纳勐笼等版纳人民政府所在地，分别组织了数百人的庆祝会。全区六百七十多个傣族村寨都举行了各种集体活动。
    节日的第三天，版纳景洪的曼景兰等村寨，联合在一起放高升、跳舞、唱歌、喝酒联欢。曼景兰农民挨温说：“共产党来了，我们的年节越过越欢”。自治区民族文工队和电影队、幻灯队等，节日中在戞洒、曼非龙、景岱等村寨巡回演出。
