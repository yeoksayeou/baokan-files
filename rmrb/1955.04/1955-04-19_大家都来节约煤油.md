Everyone Conserve Kerosene
Zhang Xiulin
    Since the end of the third quarter of last year, many places have experienced a situation where the supply of kerosene cannot meet the demand. In some places, kerosene supply is intermittent, and farmers in a few areas far from towns or supply and marketing cooperatives sometimes cannot even buy kerosene for lighting. What is the reason for this? Is it that the state has reduced the supply of kerosene to the people? No. The state's kerosene supply has not decreased in recent years, but has increased year by year. Taking Shanxi Province as an example, the kerosene supplied to the people in 1953 increased by more than 120 percent compared with 1952, and in 1954 it increased by more than 60 percent compared with 1953. Taking 1954 as an example, the kerosene supply in the second half of the year increased by 20 percent compared with the first half of the year. There was no queuing for kerosene in the first half of the year, but this phenomenon occurred in the second half of the year. The supply in the fourth quarter increased by nearly double compared with the third quarter, but the supply shortage in the fourth quarter was even more significant than in the third quarter. Therefore, the current phenomenon of kerosene shortage is mainly due to the people's growing demand for kerosene exceeding the growth rate of supply, in addition to the inconvenience of transportation or shortcomings in the operation of relevant business departments in some areas.

    Our country's petroleum industry has developed since liberation. Now the state has also sent a large number of exploration personnel to find oil fields and explore oil treasures in various places. Our country's petroleum industry has the prospect of large-scale development. However, judging from the recent situation, the foundation of our petroleum industry is still very weak, and the construction of the petroleum industry requires a long time and a large amount of investment. Therefore, in a certain period of time, the kerosene produced by the state cannot completely meet everyone's needs. To meet everyone's requirements, we also need all the people to understand the country's difficulties and actively strive to further advance our country's socialist industrialization.

    Buying some kerosene from abroad to make up for the shortage of domestic kerosene can and has already solved part of our kerosene supply problem. However, this is not a fundamental solution to the problem, because importing more kerosene requires spending more money. The state is concentrating its efforts on developing heavy industry and needs to buy machinery, industrial equipment, etc. from abroad. If we use a lot of money to buy kerosene for lighting, then the money used to buy important industrial construction equipment, etc. will be reduced, which is not in line with the long-term and fundamental interests of the people of the whole country. At the same time, the import and transportation volume of foreign kerosene is very large, and there are also difficulties in transportation.

    Our country is currently concentrating its efforts on building heavy industry. If there is not much kerosene for a while, and it is impossible to import more kerosene, then we should save a little more kerosene. But this does not mean that we should not light the lights that everyone should light. On the contrary, the state will try to supply as much kerosene as possible for work and production needs, but requires everyone not to waste it when using it, and save as much as possible. Calculated based on the number of people currently using kerosene in Shanxi Province, if each person can save two taels of kerosene per year, then the kerosene saved can be enough for the people of Yulin Prefecture to use for lighting for a year. This can not only make the kerosene supply universal and reasonable, so that everyone who needs kerosene can use kerosene, but also save money for the country. At the same time, saving kerosene is also of great benefit to oneself, enabling oneself to reduce some expenses and use this part of the money for production or other important matters. According to estimates, if everyone who uses kerosene in Shanxi Province can save two taels of kerosene per year, all the money saved can buy more than 4,600 double-wheel double-bottom plows, or buy more than 3.7 million catties of fertilizer powder, which is of great benefit to production.

    After understanding the significance and benefits of saving kerosene, some people may ask: Is it possible to save kerosene under the current kerosene supply situation? As long as everyone thinks of a way, this possibility not only exists, but is also very large. Because there are still many wasteful phenomena in the current national kerosene consumption. According to the materials from the key investigation of rural areas by the Shaanxi Petroleum Company last year, the oil consumption of each kerosene lamp without a lampshade in 1954 was six catties. Calculated on the basis of one lamp for three people, each person only needs an average of two catties of kerosene per year. However, judging from the actual supply of the Shaanxi Petroleum Company last year, each person consumed an average of two catties and three taels of kerosene. If everyone who uses kerosene in the country consumes three taels of kerosene more, the wasted figure would be very large. There are many reasons for wasting kerosene, the most important of which is that some people do not pay attention to saving kerosene. For example, they light a large lamp when they could have lit a small lamp. Or they light idle lamps and chat idly, especially during slack farming seasons. Some farmers chat until midnight, which not only wastes lamp oil, but also affects rest and production. This means that as long as everyone pays a little attention in life, they can save a lot of kerosene for the country and save a lot of money for themselves. In addition, organs, groups, and schools should also strive to concentrate office work, study, or combine lamps for office work and study in the evening according to the specific situation, in order to reduce kerosene consumption. In some places where conditions permit, appropriate substitutes can also be found. If everyone can do this, we can save a lot of kerosene and improve the kerosene supply situation in the market.

    大家都来节约煤油
    张修林
    从去年三季度末起，不少地方出现了煤油供不应求的现象，有些地方煤油供应时断时续，少数距离集镇或供销合作社比较远的地区的农民有时竟买不到煤油点灯。这是什么原因呢？是不是国家供应人民的煤油减少了？不是的。这几年来国家供应的煤油不是减少了，而是一年比一年增加了。以山西省为例，一九五三年供应人民的煤油比一九五二年增加了百分之一百二十多，一九五四年又比一九五三年增加了百分之六十多。拿一九五四年来说，下半年全省的煤油供应量比上半年增加了百分之二十，而上半年没有发生买煤油要排队等候的现象，下半年却发生了这种现象，第四季度又比第三季度的供应量增加了将近一倍，而第四季度供不应求的情况反倒比第三季度更为显著了。由此可见，目前煤油供不应求的现象，除部分地区是由于交通不便或有关业务部门经营工作有缺点外，更主要的是由于人民对煤油需要的增长，超过供应的增长速度。
    我们国家的石油工业，解放以来已经有了发展，现在国家还派出了大批勘探人员在各地找寻油田，发掘石油宝藏，我国的石油工业是有大规模发展的前途的。但是，就最近的情况来看，我们石油工业的底子还很薄弱，建设石油工业又需要较长的时间和大量的投资。所以，在一定时间内，国家出产的煤油还不能完全满足大家的需要。要满足大家的要求，还需要我们全体人民了解到国家的困难，积极努力把我国社会主义工业化事业向前推进一步。
    从国外买进一些煤油，以弥补国产煤油的不足，这也能而且已经解决了我们煤油供应的一部分问题。但是，这不是一个根本解决问题的办法，因为多进口煤油就要多花钱。国家正在集中力量发展重工业，需要从国外买进机器、买进工业器材等。我们如果把很多钱用来买进点灯用的煤油，那么，用于买进重要的工业建设器材等的钱就要减少，这是和全国人民的长远、根本利益不符合的。同时，国外煤油进口运输量很大，在运输方面也是有困难的。
    我们国家目前要集中力量建设重工业，一时既没有很多煤油，又不可能进口更多的煤油，那我们就应当多节约一点煤油。但这绝不是说，把大家应该点的灯也不点了，相反地，为了工作和生产需用的煤油，国家还是设法尽量供应的，只是要求大家在用的时候不要浪费，能节约的尽量节约。以山西全省现在用煤油的人数计算，如果每人每年能节约二两煤油，那么，节约下来的这一部分煤油就可以够榆林专区人民一年点灯用。这样不仅可以使煤油的供应做到普遍而合理，使需要煤油的人都能用上煤油，还可以给国家节约资金。同时，节约使用煤油对自己也有很大好处，使自己能够减少一部分开支，把这一部分钱用到生产上或其他重要的事情上。根据估计，山西全省用煤油的人如果每人每年能节约二两煤油，所有节省下来的钱就可以买到四千六百多部双轮双铧犁，或买三百七十多万斤肥田粉，这对生产是有很大好处的。
    明白节约煤油的意义和好处以后，也许有人会问：按现在煤油供应的情况，是否有节约的可能呢？只要大家想办法，这种可能不但有，而且是很大的。因为眼前全国煤油消费中存在的浪费现象还不少。从陕西省石油公司去年在农村重点调查的材料中看，每盏不带灯罩的煤油灯一九五四年的耗油量为六斤，按三个人一盏灯计算，每人每年平均两斤煤油就够了。但是，从陕西省石油公司去年的实际供应量看，每人平均要消费二斤三两煤油。如果全国所有用煤油的人都这样多消耗三两煤油，浪费的数字就很大。浪费煤油的原因很多，其中最主要的一个，就是有些人不注意节约煤油。比如可以点小灯的却点了大灯。或者点闲灯、谈闲话，尤其在农闲时，有些农民一谈半夜，不仅浪费灯油，而且影响休息和生产。这就是说只要大家在生活中稍为注意，就可以为国家节省很多煤油，给自己节省许多钱。另外机关、团体和学校也应根据具体情况，在晚间力求集中办公、学习或合灯办公、学习，以减少煤油消耗。在一些条件许可的地方也可以找适当的代用品。如果大家都能这样做，我们就可以节省很多煤油，改善市场上煤油的供应情况。
