    The Vietnamese People's Army, in accordance with the ceasefire agreement, began on April 22 to take over in stages the last temporary stationing area of the French army in the northern half of Vietnam – the Haiphong area. After the takeover work is completed on May 16, the northern half of Vietnam will be completely liberated.
    The Haiphong area, bordering the Gulf of Tonkin to the east, includes the four provinces of Kien An, Hai Duong, Quang Yen, and Hong Gai, with a length of nearly 100 kilometers from east to west and a maximum width of more than 40 kilometers from north to south. It covers an area of approximately 2,000 square kilometers and has a population of 750,000. Thousands of islands of various sizes are scattered in the gulf.
    The Haiphong area has three seaports that can accommodate ships of 5,000 to 10,000 tons – Haiphong, Hong Gai, and Ong Men (i.e., Cam Pha Port), and six larger cities, including Haiphong, Quang Yen, Kien An, Hong Gai, Cam Pha, and Cat Ba.
    Haiphong City, with a population of over 200,000, is the largest seaport in North Vietnam. Before the war, three to four hundred foreign ships docked there annually, with an annual cargo throughput of about 200,000 tons. From Haiphong, there are railways to Hanoi, and many highways and waterways connect it to other towns in the Red River Delta. The city has dozens of larger industrial and commercial enterprises, including textiles, rice milling, and ship and vehicle repair industries. Among them, the Haiphong Cement Factory is the largest in scale, with four to five thousand workers and a monthly output of 20,000 tons of cement.
    The area around Haiphong has abundant natural resources, such as zinc mines, cement rock mines, and iron mines. Most importantly, it is home to the world-renowned Hong Gai coal mine, known for producing anthracite.
    The Hong Gai coal mine is one of the largest coal mining areas in Asia, with a mining area of 120 kilometers long. Its annual output is about one million tons, accounting for 70% of Vietnam's national coal production. The Hong Gai coal mine has many mining areas, such as Cam Pha, Ha Tu, and Ha Lam, most of which are open-pit mines and horizontal shafts, with Cam Pha mine having the largest output and more complete equipment. The Hong Gai coal mine has been mined for seventy or eighty years, but its reserves are still very rich, estimated to be recoverable for another 200 million tons.
    In addition to the famous coal production, Kim Thanh, Thuy Nguyen, and An Hung counties in the Haiphong area are famous granaries, and the coastal harbors are rich in fish, salt, and seafood. In Van Hai alone, the annual timber production exceeds 70,000 tons.
    During the Vietnamese War of Resistance, the Haiphong area was the French army's major rear base for its war of aggression in northern Vietnam. The French army built air and naval bases in strategically important coastal areas such as Haiphong, Do Son, and Cat Ba. The Cat Bi airport in Haiphong was one of the three largest air force bases of the French in Indochina.
    However, even within this area that the French army called its "heartland," the local people's heroic struggle against aggression never ceased. The people persisted in arduous guerrilla warfare near Haiphong City, tying down the French army's forces. In the spring of 1954, local people's armed forces also raided Cat Bi Airport, destroying dozens of French military aircraft, powerfully supporting the Vietnamese People's Army's siege of the French army at Dien Bien Phu. After the ceasefire, workers, farmers, students, and people from all walks of life in the Haiphong area have been carrying out heroic struggles to protect factories and mines, oppose persecution, and oppose forced migration to the south, welcoming their own army and liberation with new victories of struggle.

    海防地区概况
    越南人民军根据停战协议从四月二十二日起开始分段接管法军在越南北半部的最后一个临时驻扎地段——海防地区。接管工作在五月十六日结束后，越南北半部就将完全解放。
    东临东京湾的海防地区包括建安、海阳、广安和鸿基四个省份，东西长近一百公里，南北最宽处有四十多公里。面积约二千平方公里，人口有七十五万。散布在海湾上有成千个大小岛屿。
    海防地区有海防、鸿基、翁门（即锦普港）三个可容吨位五千吨至万吨的船只的海港，有海防、广安、建安、鸿基、锦普、吉婆等六个较大的城市。
    拥有二十多万人口的海防市是北越最大的海港。战前每年有三、四百艘外国船只靠岸，每年货物的吞吐量在二十万吨左右。从海防有铁路通到河内，有许多公路、水路把它和红河三角洲的其他城镇连接起来。市内有数十个较大的工商企业，包括纺织、碾米、船只车辆修理等工业。其中以海防水泥工厂的规模最大，全厂有四、五千工人，月产水泥二万吨。
    海防周围地区有丰富的天然资源，如锌矿、水泥岩石矿、铁矿等。最重要的是以产无烟煤闻名世界的鸿基煤矿。
    鸿基煤矿是亚洲最大的煤矿区之一，矿区长一百二十公里。每年产量在一百万吨左右，占越南全国煤产量百分之七十。鸿基煤矿有锦普、河都、河林等好多矿区，这些矿区多是露天矿和横井，其中以锦普矿的产量最大，设备较完善。鸿基煤矿已经开采了七、八十年，但矿藏还很丰富，据估计可再开采两万万吨。
    除了著名的煤产以外，海防地区的金城、水原、安兴等县是有名的谷仓，沿海的港湾盛产鱼、盐和海产。在文海一地，每年产木材就在七万吨以上。
    在越南抗战期间，海防地区是法军在越南北部进行侵略战争的大后方。法军在沿海险要的地方如海防、涂山、吉婆等地修建了空军、海军的基地，海防的吉碑机场是法国在印度支那三个最大的空军基地之一。
    但是，就在这个法军自称为心腹地带内，当地人民反抗侵略的英勇斗争从来没有间断过。人民在海防市的附近坚持着艰苦的游击战，牵制了法军的兵力。一九五四年春，当地人民武装还突袭过吉碑机场，击毁了数十架法军飞机，有力地支援了越南人民军在奠边府对法军的围攻。停战后，海防地区的工人、农民、学生和各阶层人民一直进行着保护厂矿、反迫害、反强迫南迁的英勇斗争，以新的斗争胜利来迎接自己的军队和解放。　（新华社）
