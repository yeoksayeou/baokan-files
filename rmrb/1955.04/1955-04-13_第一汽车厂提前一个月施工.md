    First Automobile Works Starts Construction a Month Early
    The First Automobile Works widely adopted early spring construction measures, enabling the start of construction projects approximately one month earlier than in 1954.
    Soldiers from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army participating in the plant's construction, based on the "frozen bricklaying method" learned during winter construction and the bricklaying regulations for the early spring thawing period, are laying bricks under the windows or eaves of the foundry, motorcycle workshop, and car body stamping workshop. The soldiers hung large straw curtains on the sun-facing walls to prevent the newly laid walls from thawing too quickly. In various factory buildings and the power station warehouse, many poured equipment foundations are continuing to use the "heat storage method" to prevent concrete from freezing and cracking when the night temperature drops below 0 degrees Celsius. In April, the concrete mixing station will produce thousands of cubic meters of warm-water mixed concrete specifically for use at early spring construction sites. The last production workshop to begin construction at the First Automobile Works – the straightening workshop – and some other new projects also widely adopted the "electric heating soil thawing method" to quickly thaw the frozen soil layer in order to start digging foundations earlier.

    第一汽车厂提前一个月施工
    第一汽车制造厂广泛采用初春施工措施，使建筑工程的开工时间比一九五四年提前了一个月左右。
    参加建厂的人民解放军某部的战士们，根据冬季施工中学会的“冻结砌砖法”和初春解冻时期的砌砖规定，正在铸工场、摩托工场和车身压制工场的窗口或屋檐下砌砖。战士们在向太阳光的一面墙上，挂上了大草帘，防止砌好的墙面解冻过快。各个厂房和动力站仓库内，许多浇灌好的设备基础正在继续采用“蓄热法”，防止晚间温度下降到摄氏零度以下时造成混凝土冻裂。四月份，混凝土搅拌台将生产几千立方公尺的温水搅拌混凝土，专门供初春施工的现场使用。第一汽车制造厂最后开工的一座生产厂房——整径工场和别的一些新工程为了提前挖地基，也曾广泛采用“电热融土法”，使冻土层迅速解冻。　（新华社）
