Xinhua News Agency, 13th Dispatch: According to obtained information, the wreckage of the Indian International Airlines "Kashmir Princess" plane, carrying personnel of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference and Chinese and foreign journalists, which was sabotaged by U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, has been found near Stannow Island in the Greater Natuna Islands of Indonesia, 500 kilometers northeast of Singapore. The fuselage crashed into the water one kilometer from the coast. In addition to some luggage found near the wreckage, no survivors or bodies were found.

According to an announcement from the British Navy in Singapore, three crew members were rescued by the British fast escort ship "Dampier" on a small island. They are co-pilot Dixit, navigator Pathak, and ground mechanic Kanik. It is claimed that the search for the victims is still underway.

Jakarta Airport authorities stated that ten minutes before the crash (local time 16:20 on the 11th), the "Kashmir Princess" reported to the airport that its navigation was normal. At that time, the plane was approximately one and a half hours away from Jakarta. Ten minutes later, the plane sent out three consecutive emergency distress signals and then went silent. According to fishermen on Stannow Island, the plane exploded and caught fire in the air before crashing into the sea.

Xinhua News Agency, 13th Dispatch from Hong Kong: The British government in Hong Kong issued a statement on the 13th, discussing certain circumstances surrounding the departure from Hong Kong of the Indian International Airlines plane carrying the staff of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference, which was sabotaged by U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents. The statement confirmed that the Chinese government had, through the British Chargé d'Affaires in Beijing, issued a warning regarding the plot by U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek special agents to sabotage the plane. The Hong Kong British government's statement did not deny the possibility that someone had secretly placed explosives on the plane in Hong Kong, and stated that the Hong Kong "police are still conducting a thorough investigation." According to a United Press International dispatch from Hong Kong on the 12th, "rumors in Hong Kong state that the Indian plane carrying the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference crashed due to sabotage."

    香港英国当局发表声明谈失事飞机离港情况
    新华社十三日讯　据已获得的消息说，出席亚非会议的中国代表团人员和中外新闻记者乘坐的被美蒋特务破坏失事的印度国际航空公司的“克什米尔公主号”飞机残骸，已在新加坡东北五百公里的印度尼西亚所属的大那多那群岛的斯达瑙岛附近发现。机身坠入离海岸一公里的水中。在飞机残骸附近除发现若干行李外，没有发现生人或尸体。
    据新加坡英国海军方面宣布，已有三位机上人员在一个小岛上被英国快速护航舰“丹皮尔号”救出，他们是副驾驶员狄克西特，领航员帕塔克，地勤机械师卡尼克。据称，寻找遇难人员的工作仍在进行中。
    雅加达飞机场管理当局说，“克什米尔公主号”飞机在失事前十分钟（当地时间十一日十六时二十分）曾向该机场报告航行情况正常，当时该机的位置距雅加达约有一小时半的行程。十分钟后，该机即连续发出三次紧急求救信号，以后即渺无音讯。据斯达瑙岛上渔民说，该机是在空中爆炸起火后坠入海中的。
    新华社十三日讯　香港消息：香港英国政府十三日发表声明，谈到了中国出席亚非会议的代表团工作人员所乘坐的被美蒋特务破坏失事的印度国际航空公司的飞机离开香港之前的某些情况。声明证实了中国政府经英国驻北京代办处提出了关于美蒋特务分子阴谋破坏这架飞机的警告。香港英国政府的声明没有否认有人在香港在飞机上暗置破坏物的可能性，并说香港“警方尚在进行充分调查中”。据合众社香港十二日电说，香港传说，载有出席亚非会议的中国代表团人员的印度飞机“是由于有人进行破坏而失事的”。
