Title: It's Time to Study Seriously

Until now, some comrades, even quite responsible comrades, have not really taken study to heart. Because they don't study, they don't understand; and because they don't understand, they inevitably make errors of principle in their work.

On January 19th of this year, the Propaganda Department of the CPC Chuxian Prefectural Committee in Anhui Province issued an "Instruction on Further Improving Supplementary Propaganda Work for the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain." The instruction mentioned the issue of "implementing the Party's fundamental line in rural areas." The original text stated: "We must treat rich peasants differently. Unlawful rich peasants must be punished according to the law, so as to achieve the policy of killing one to warn a hundred, in order to divide, win over, and neutralize the rich peasants, and to make them sell all their surplus grain to the state." This statement clearly violates the Party's fundamental line in rural areas. Party documents stipulate that the Party's fundamental line for socialist transformation in rural areas is: to rely on the poor peasants (including all new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants), consolidate the unity of the middle peasants, develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and restrict and gradually eliminate the rich peasant economy. However, the Chuxian Prefectural Committee Propaganda Department told us to "win over" and "neutralize" the rich peasants. If this statement came from a new comrade who had just started working, it might be excusable; however, it is very inappropriate for such a statement to appear in the propaganda instructions of the Prefectural Committee Propaganda Department, which is in charge of ideological work. The comrades who drafted and reviewed the instructions of the Chuxian Prefectural Committee Propaganda Department often say that they want to resolutely implement the Party's fundamental line in rural areas, but we have every reason to conclude that they themselves have not understood the content of the Party's fundamental line in rural areas. Otherwise, it would be difficult to explain why they made such a fundamental error.

The situation of making mistakes in work due to not seriously studying policies is by no means an isolated case. The situation revealed not long ago in the handling of the handicraft production cooperative issue by the Fengtai County Committee and the County People's Government in Anhui Province is also a typical example. The facts are as follows: There is a Limin Ironware Production Cooperative in Chengguan District, Fengtai County. In September 1954, because the houses were flooded, they applied to the government for the allocation of state-owned land to build a factory. The Civil Affairs Section of the County People's Government believed that "the cooperative is a private workshop and cannot be allocated land." Later, the County Cooperative General Office and the Handicraft Management Section also put forward their opinions, but the problem was not resolved for several months because of the entanglement over whether the handicraft production cooperative was "private." Not only were the comrades in the Civil Affairs Section unclear about the nature of the handicraft production cooperative, but even Hu Chenggong, deputy secretary of the County Committee, and Li Zichun, the County Mayor, were also unclear. They said: "Our level is very low, and we cannot be sure without written evidence." In fact, Article 7 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China already has a clear stipulation: "The cooperative economy is a socialist economy of collective ownership by the working masses, or a semi-socialist economy of partial collective ownership by the working masses." If even the nature of the cooperative is "uncertain," how can we lead the socialist transformation of handicrafts, and how can we correctly implement the Party's policies?

Low theoretical and policy level is indeed a practical problem for many comrades. But the key lies in whether they can work hard to study. If a revolutionary worker can tirelessly study Marxist-Leninist theory and the Party's policies, his level will continue to improve. Otherwise, in the face of increasingly complex socialist construction tasks, he will inevitably be in danger of falling behind.

We should shout loudly to these comrades who do not care about learning: It is time to study seriously!

    是认真学习的时候了
    疏明
    直到现在，还有一部分同志，甚至是相当负责的同志，并没有真正把学习放在心上。因为不学，所以就不懂；因为不懂，在工作当中就不免会发生原则性的错误。
    今年一月十九日，中共安徽省滁县地委宣传部发出了一个“关于进一步做好粮食统购统销的宣传补课工作的指示”，指示里边讲到了“贯彻党在农村的根本路线”的问题。原文说：“对富农必须分别对待，对于不法富农要依法惩办，做到打一儆百的政策，以达到分化、争取、中立富农，并使其余粮全部卖给国家的目的。”这个说法，显然是直接违背了党在农村的根本路线的。党的文件中规定党在农村实行社会主义改造的根本路线是：依靠贫农（包括全部原为贫农的新中农），巩固地团结中农，发展互助合作运动，限制和逐步消灭富农经济。但是，滁县地委宣传部却告诉我们要“争取”和“中立”富农。如果这种说法出自一个刚刚参加工作的新同志之口，也许还情有可原吧；然而这种说法竟出现在专管思想工作的地委宣传部的宣传指示上，就很不应该了。滁县地委宣传部起草指示以及审查签发指示的同志们，虽然嘴里也常说要坚决贯彻党在农村中的根本路线，但是我们完全有理由可以断定：他们自己并没有弄懂党在农村的根本路线的内容的。不然，就很难解释他们为什么会发生这样原则性的错误。
    平时不认真学习政策因而在工作中造成错误的情况绝不是个别的。不久前，安徽省凤台县委和县人民政府在处理手工业生产合作社问题上所暴露出来的情况，也是一个典型的例子。事实是这样：凤台县城关区有个利民铁业生产合作社，一九五四年九月间，因为房屋被大水淹了，向政府申请批给国有地基修建厂房。县人民政府民政科认为“该社是私营作坊，不能批给地基”。后来该社又经县合作总社和手工业管理科提出意见，但始终由于对手工业生产合作社是不是“私营”的问题纠缠不清，拖了几个月一直没有得到解决。对于手工业生产合作社究竟是什么性质的问题，不仅民政科的同志闹不清楚，连县委副书记胡成功和县长李自春两同志也闹不清楚。他们说：“我们水平很低，没有文字根据，不能肯定。”事实上，中华人民共和国宪法第七条上已有了明确的规定：“合作社经济是劳动群众集体所有制的社会主义经济，或者是劳动群众部分集体所有制的半社会主义经济。”如果连合作社的性质都“不能肯定”，那怎样去领导对手工业进行社会主义改造，怎样能正确贯彻党的政策呢？
    理论政策水平低，对于不少同志来说，的确是一个实际问题。但关键还在于他们能不能去努力学习。一个革命工作者，如果能孜孜不倦地去学习马克思列宁主义理论，学习党的政策，那他的水平就会不断地提高。否则，在日益复杂的社会主义建设任务面前，就免不了有掉队的危险。
    应该向这些不关心学习的同志大喝一声：已经是认真学习的时候了！
