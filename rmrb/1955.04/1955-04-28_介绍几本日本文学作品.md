    Introducing Several Japanese Literary Works
    Liu Zhongping
    Recently, the Writers Publishing House has published several Japanese literary works: Kobayashi Takiji's "Kanikosen" (translated by Shi Yi), "Party Life" (translated by Li Keyi, proofread by Shi Yi), and Harukawa Tetsuo's "Japanese Workers" (translated by Mei Tao and Wen Jieruo).
    Kobayashi Takiji and Harukawa Tetsuo are two Japanese writers belonging to different periods. Kobayashi Takiji, the outstanding representative of Japanese proletarian literature, was brutally murdered by Japanese police in a torture chamber in 1933, at the young age of thirty. What he left behind in his short and intense creative activity is a portrayal of the intensification of class struggle in Japan during the rampant period of Japanese fascist militarist forces. Harukawa Tetsuo, a writer of worker origin, wrote about the experiences of the people of Japan after World War II, as a defeated nation under the military control of American imperialism. Although the eras reflected are different, it is not difficult for us to see commonalities in these works, namely, the oppression and suffering of the Japanese working people, their resistance and struggle, and the genuine patriotic enthusiasm expressed by the authors as communists in their works.
    "Kanikosen" is one of Kobayashi Takiji's most famous works.
  The truth that "capital, from head to toe, every pore is dripping with blood and dirty things" is vividly illustrated here. In this work, the author depicts the naked slave labor on a crab fishing boat going to the Sea of Okhotsk, exposing the collusion between Japanese monopoly capitalists and the reactionary government in their cruel suppression and appalling exploitation of the workers. It also reflects the development path of the Japanese working class from spontaneous struggle to conscious struggle. "The company is very careful each time it recruits fishermen. They entrust the village head and the police chief of the recruitment area to send 'model youths.' They select workers who are completely uninterested in trade unions and are 'loyal and honest.' They believe that this way, they can be 'foolproof' and everything will be satisfactory! However, the 'work' on the Kanikosen unexpectedly united these workers—organized them. No 'foolproof' capitalist noticed this strange development. It is very ridiculous, as if the capitalists deliberately recruited those unorganized workers and incorrigible 'drunkards' to educate them on how to unite." For the capitalists, this may indeed be a "strange development," but for the workers, it is an extremely natural development. Slave labor under the threat of guns, torture, and beatings, without basic life guarantees, and the harsh living conditions surrounded by lice and fleas, cannot but arouse people's resistance. Moreover, based on their own experiences, they finally understood that "every war in Japan... is initiated by a few wealthy people (millionaires) who insist on finding some reasons to start it," and that "imperial warships, with their fine names, are actually the lackeys of the capitalists." In the struggle, they also discovered their own strength. After the first strike was suppressed, they said again, "Okay, let's do it again!" In the face of people who already understand why to fight and how to fight, bayonets and arrests are powerless. And it is the capitalists' own cruel exploitation that educates the workers to understand these truths. The capitalists created their own gravediggers. That's the way things are. Through the truthful depiction of life and struggle on the Kanikosen, the writer convincingly reveals this truth.
    Another novella collected in this anthology, "March 15, 1928," is a microcosm of the famous "March 15th Incident" in the history of the Japanese revolutionary movement. The author's outrage and hatred for the bloody suppression and medieval torture inflicted on revolutionaries by the militarist fascist rule, and the author's depiction of the communist and trade union workers' awe-inspiring and unyielding heroism, cannot but move us even when reading it now. "...If I am beaten to death and the proletarian movement is eliminated from then on, I would have to consider it, but our ranks are getting bigger and bigger, and I am very relieved about this." What a bold language, filled with what confidence! After being tortured and waking up from a state of delirium, he immediately worriedly asked if he had said something he shouldn't have said. When he learned that he had only repeatedly said "It's not so easy to die," he "breathed a sigh of relief and immediately laughed unnaturally." What a firm and loyal expression this is! Whether it is Watanabe, or Ryukichi, who comes from an intellectual background, or the vast majority of others, after the test of fire, they all show the essence of pure gold. The unyielding heroic images of these people are always the example for the working class fighters.
    "Party Life" is one of the works written by Kobayashi Takiji in his persecuted and unfree life. This work is based on his own underground life and the workers' struggle in a factory he had contact with. In this novel, he reflects the process of workers in a factory that was converted into a military industry due to the beginning of the war of aggression against China, developing from demanding improved treatment to opposing the war of aggression. At the same time, he writes about the glorious image of a communist who completely abandoned personal life and persisted in the work of the party while being pursued by the police. This image reminds us of the famous words of the Czechoslovak national hero, Julius Fučík: "...I have always lived underground, as the roots of a tree are destined to do—these clumsy, yellowing roots, surrounded by darkness and decay, support the tree of life on the ground. That is their pride, and mine too. I have no regrets... and I am willing and happy." For people who dedicate their entire lives to the cause of the liberation of all mankind and hold the lofty ideals of communism, this spirit of dedication is common.
    The late 1920s and early 1930s were the time when Japanese imperialists were actively launching a war of aggression against China. We, the people who heard the sound of the "September 18th Incident" and the Lugou Bridge Incident, are familiar with the Japanese aggressors. But compared to the situation of the oppression and deception of ordinary Japanese people at that time, as well as their resistance and struggle, we don't know it so concretely. Kobayashi Takiji's works are now being introduced, which is of great significance for increasing our understanding of the lives and struggles of the Japanese people.
    The Chinese people, who have been subjected to long-term imperialist oppression, deeply sympathize with the suffering of the Japanese people who are currently reduced to a colony of American imperialism. Harukawa Tetsuo's "Japanese Workers," although simply written, is a book written by an author who worked as a worker on an American military base based on his own personal experience, and we feel close to it. From here, it is not difficult for us to see the awakening of the ordinary Japanese people, and their anger towards the American warmongers who are turning Japan into a military base and want to drive the Japanese people to be cannon fodder in another war of aggression. The Japanese people have not forgotten the painful lessons of World War II. When they hear the calls for war again, they are not so easily deceived. "What good will it do us to fight? The only way is to drive out those bastards who are turning Japan into a colony! Hey, don't mistake the enemy!" This is their answer. They answered the increasingly intensified slave labor forced on them after the United States launched the war of intervention in Korea with go-slows and strikes. And this struggle is expanding day by day. Harukawa Tetsuo said in a letter to the Chinese translator: "The resistance movement of Japanese workers on the American military base that I described in this work was only in its initial stage two years ago, only a spark, but now it has gradually spread and has become an inextinguishable, continuously burning raging fire. ... We held a general strike on all the bases in the Keihin area, making it impossible for the warmongers to transport military supplies to massacre Asian brothers; that general strike made every order of the American imperialists attacked by us on their own bases, and they can no longer act arbitrarily."
    The power of the people who have begun to awaken cannot be stopped. During the war years, Japanese militarism, which claimed to have the most sophisticated police system in the world, cruelly persecuted and suppressed the representatives of the advanced forces among the people—the Japanese Communist Party (we concretely saw this persecution in Kobayashi Takiji's works), but it could not completely eradicate this force no matter what; after the war, the Japanese communists walked out of prison and out of the underground, and raised high the banner of striving for independence, liberation, and democracy. The people increasingly see clearly who are the true defenders of their interests. Although the Japanese Communist Party has been subjected to new persecution, they are still steadfastly fighting for the independence and liberation of Japan. From the work "Japanese Workers," we can clearly see this point.
    The liberated Chinese people are greatly concerned about the lives and struggles of the Japanese people living in the American colonial state. Literary works reflecting the lives and struggles of the Japanese people are being introduced in increasing numbers, which is a manifestation of this concern. Promoting friendship and understanding between the people of the two countries through the exchange of literary works will greatly help our common cause of defending peace. The Japanese people's struggle for independence and liberation, and their struggle against the United States rearming Japan and turning Japan into a U.S. military base, are part of the world's people's struggle to defend peace. We believe that the Japanese people will win victory, break the shackles imposed on them by American imperialism, and embark on the path of independent and democratic development.

    介绍几本日本文学作品
    刘仲平
    最近，作家出版社出版了几本日本文学作品——小林多喜二的“蟹工船”（适夷译）、“党生活者”（李克异译、适夷校）和春川铁男的“日本劳动者”（梅韬、文洁若译）。
    小林多喜二和春川铁男，这是属于不同时期的两位日本作家。小林多喜二，这位日本无产阶级文学的杰出的代表者，在一九三三年，在刚刚三十岁的时候，就被日本警察残酷地虐杀在拷问室里了。他在短促而紧张的创造活动中所留下来的是日本法西斯军国主义势力正在猖狂时候的日本国内阶级斗争尖锐化的写照；而春川铁男，这位工人出身的作家所写的，却是第二次世界大战以后，作为战败国并为美帝国主义军事控制的日本的人民的遭遇。反映的时代虽然不同，但我们从这些作品里不难看到共通的东西，那就是日本劳动人民所受的压榨、苦难和他们的反抗、斗争，以及作为共产党人的作者在作品里所流露出来的真正的爱国主义热情。
    “蟹工船”是小林多喜二的最有名的作品之一。
  “资本就是从头到脚，每个毛孔都流着血和肮脏的东西”这一真理，在这里有着鲜明的形象的说明。在这部作品里，作者描写了一条到堪察加海面去捕蟹的蟹工船上的赤裸裸的奴隶劳动，揭发了日本垄断资本家和反动政府互相勾结，对工人们所进行的残酷的镇压和惊人的剥削，同时也反映了日本工人阶级从自发斗争走上自觉斗争的发展道路。“公司每次招收渔工是很小心的。他们托招收地的村长、警察局长送‘模范青年’来。选拔那种完全不关心工会的，‘忠诚老实’的工人。认为这样就可以‘百无一失’万事如意了！可是蟹工船的‘活计’，终于恰巧相反地把这些工人团结起来——组织起来了。任何‘百无一失’的资本家，可没有注意到这个奇怪的发展。这是很滑稽的，好像资本家特意招来那些无组织的工人和不可救药的‘酒鬼’，教育他们怎样团结。”对于资本家，这也许真的是一个“奇怪的发展”，但对于工人们，这却是一个极为自然的发展。手枪、火刑、吊打等等威逼下的、没有起码生命保障的奴隶劳动，虱子、跳蚤围攻中的恶劣生活条件，不能不激起人们的反抗。而且，凭着切身的体验，他们终于懂得了“原来日本每次的战争，……都是几个有钱人（大富翁）出的主意，硬找些理由发动起来的”，“帝国军舰，叫得倒好听，原来是资本家的走狗”。在斗争中，他们也发现了自己的力量，在第一次罢工被镇压下去以后，他们又说道：“好，再来一次！”在已经懂得了为什么斗争和怎样斗争的人们面前，刺刀和逮捕是无能为力的。而教育工人们懂得这些道理的，却是资本家的残酷剥削本身。资本家给自己造成了掘墓人。事情的规律就是这样的。作家通过对蟹工船上的生活和斗争的真实描绘，令人信服地揭示了这个真理。
    收在这本集子里的另一篇小说“一九二八年三月十五日”，是日本革命运动史上著名的“三·一五事件”的缩影。作者在这里所流露的对军国主义法西斯统治加给革命者的血腥镇压和中世纪的酷刑的愤慨和仇恨，作者所描绘的共产党人、工会工作者的凛然不屈的英雄气概，现在读来也不能不使我们激动。“……如果我给揍死了，无产阶级的运动从此消灭，那我倒要考虑一下，可是咱们的队伍是越来越大的，这一点，我很放心。”这是何等豪放，充满着怎样的信心的语言啊！受了非刑拷打，从一直说着呓语的状态里醒过来之后，马上耽心地问是不是说了不该说的话，等到知道自己不过反复说着“不是那么容易死”一句话以后，“才透出了一口大气，立刻不自然地大笑起来”，这又是何等坚定，何等忠贞的表现啊！不论是渡，或是知识分子出身的龙吉，或是其他绝大多数人，经过火的考验，都显示了纯金的本质，这些人的不屈的英雄形象，永远是工人阶级的战斗者的榜样。
    “党生活者”是小林多喜二在被追捕的不自由的生活中所写下的作品之一。这篇作品就是取材于他自己的地下生活和同他有过联系的一个工厂里的工人斗争的。在这部小说里，他反映了当时由于侵略中国战争的开始而转为军事工业的一家工厂里的工人，由要求改善待遇而发展到反对侵略战争的斗争过程；同时写出了一个完全舍弃了个人生活、在警察追捕中坚持着党的工作的共产党员的光辉形象。这个形象使我们想起了捷克斯洛伐克民族英雄伏契克的有名的话：“……我一直生活在地下，像树根被注定的那样——这些笨拙枯黄的树根，在黑暗和腐朽的环绕中，支持着地面上的生命之树。那是它们的骄傲，也是我的。我毫无遗憾……并且甘心乐意。”对于把整个生命献给全人类解放事业、抱有共产主义崇高理想的人们来说，这种献身的精神原就是共通的。
    二十年代末和三十年代初期，正是日本帝国主义者积极发动侵略中国的战争的时候。我们，曾经听到过“九·一八”的枪声和芦沟桥的炮响的人们，对日本侵略者是熟悉的。但对当时日本普通人民受压榨、受欺骗的情况以及他们的反抗和斗争，比较起来，知道得却不是那样具体。小林多喜二的作品现在被介绍过来，对增进我们对日本人民的生活和斗争的了解，是有很大意义的。
    曾经受过帝国主义长期压迫的中国人民，对于目前沦为美帝国主义殖民地的日本人民的苦难遭遇，是寄予深切同情的。春川铁男的“日本劳动者”，虽然写得简朴，但这部由一位在美军军事基地上当工人的作者根据亲身体验所写的书，我们是感到亲切的。从这里，我们不难看出日本普通人民的觉醒，看出他们对于正在变日本为军事基地，想驱使日本人民作另一次侵略战争的炮灰的美国战争贩子的愤怒。日本人民并没有忘记第二次世界大战的惨痛教训。当他们再次地听到战争叫嚣的时候，他们不那样轻易地受骗了。“打起仗来对我们能有什么好处？只有把那些使日本变为殖民地的坏蛋驱逐出去才能有办法！喂，不要认错了敌人！”这就是他们的回答。他们用怠工和罢工来回答了美国发动干涉朝鲜的战争后迫使他们日益加强的奴隶劳动。而且这斗争一天天扩大开去。春川铁男在写给中译者的信上说：“我在这个作品里所描写的美军基地上日本工人的反抗运动，两年前还只是在萌芽阶段，还仅仅是星星之火，现在渐次蔓延，已变成为不可扑灭的、不断燃烧着的熊熊烈焰了。……我们在京滨地区所有的基地上举行过总罢工，使战争贩子无法输送军需品去残杀亚洲兄弟；那次总罢工使美帝国主义者的每一项命令，都在他们自己的基地上遭到了我们的抨击，他们再也不能肆意妄为了。”
    开始觉醒的人民的力量，是没有办法可以扼阻的。在战争年代中，号称拥有世界上最严密的警察制度的日本军国主义，曾那样残酷地迫害、镇压过人民中的先进力量的代表者——日本共产党（我们在小林多喜二的作品中具体地看到了这种迫害），但它无论如何也不能把这力量斩尽杀绝；在战后，日本共产党人，从牢狱里走出来，从地下走出来，又高高擎起了争取独立、解放、民主的大旗。人民日益看清了谁是他们利益的真正维护者，尽管日本共产党又受到新的迫害，但他们仍然坚定不移地为日本的独立和解放进行着斗争。从“日本劳动者”这部作品里，我们可以清楚地看到这一点。
    解放了的中国人民，对处在美国殖民地状态中的日本人民的生活和斗争是寄予莫大关心的。反映日本人民生活和斗争的文学作品，日益增多地被介绍过来，就是这一关心的表现。通过文学作品的互相交流，增进两国人民间的友谊和了解，是会大大有助于我们保卫和平的共同事业的。日本人民争取独立解放的斗争，反对美国重新武装日本、反对变日本为美国军事基地的斗争，是全世界人民保卫和平斗争的一部分。我们相信，日本人民将会赢得胜利，打破美帝国主义加在他们身上的镣铐，而走上独立、民主的发展道路。
