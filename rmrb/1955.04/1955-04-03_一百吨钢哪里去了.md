To the Editor:

    Recently, the Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Hardware and Machinery Company conducted a clearance of accounts and discovered a shortage of one hundred tons of round steel. According to the records, this one hundred tons of steel was still stored at the Tianjin Steel Plant, awaiting collection. However, further verification proved that the Tianjin Steel Plant had already delivered the goods in full. But they could not find the steel in the warehouse, no matter what.

    Where did this one hundred tons of round steel go?

    It turned out that as early as November 1953, the Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Hardware and Machinery Company purchased two hundred tons of round steel from the Tianjin Steel Plant and supplied one hundred tons to the Qingdao branch. The remaining one hundred tons were stored in the Wujiazui warehouse by the transportation section. However, the accountant in charge of storage did not complete the procedures and still believed that this one hundred tons of steel was stored at the Tianjin Steel Plant. At that time, they happened to be transferring the steel originally stored in the Wujiazui warehouse to the Jinan branch. In order to complete the transportation plan for the fourth quarter, the transportation section hurriedly transported all the steel in stock to the Jinan branch without receiving a supply order, and did not contact the business department and the finance and accounting department afterward.

    More than a year has passed, and no one has ever inquired about it. In the third and fourth quarters of 1954, although inventory clearance, property inventory, reconciliation of accounts and goods, and year-end accounting were carried out, this error was still not discovered. More seriously, last December, the Jinan branch found a surplus of fifty-eight tons of round steel and sent someone to contact the Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station, but they blindly believed that they were not at fault. Later, the Shandong Provincial Department of Commerce wrote to the Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station asking them to check whether there was a shortage of steel, but they still ignored the matter. It was not until recently that the problem was discovered.

    The Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Hardware and Machinery Company has experienced commodity confusion more than once. In 1954, the total value of short-supplied commodities was more than 1.48 million yuan, and the total value of surplus commodities was more than 1.49 million yuan. Among them, in addition to those that have been identified and dealt with, the commodities whose whereabouts cannot be found include: losses caused by shortages of about 600,000 yuan, and the value of surplus commodities is more than 490,000 yuan.

    This unclear procedure and chaotic system have brought great losses to the country. We hope that everyone will fight against this chaotic financial management phenomenon, stop waste, and save money for the country.

### 一百吨钢哪里去了

    一百吨钢哪里去了编辑同志：
    最近中国五金机械公司天津采购供应站清理了一次账目，发现短少了一百吨元钢。根据账上的记载，这一百吨钢还存在天津钢厂没有提取。后来，又经过进一步查对，证明天津钢厂早已经把货交清了。但是他们在仓库里无论如何也找不到这些钢。
    这一百吨元钢究竟到哪里去了呢？
    原来，早在一九五三年十一月间，中国五金机械公司天津采购供应站在天津钢厂购进元钢二百吨，供给了青岛分公司一百吨。余下的一百吨由运输科存放在吴家咀仓库里。但是负责保管的会计并没有办清手续，仍然认为这一百吨钢还在天津钢厂存着。当时，正好他们要把吴家咀仓库里原存的钢调运到济南支公司去，运输科为了完成第四季度的运输计划，还没有接到供应单就急忙把库存的钢全部运到济南支公司去了，事后也没有同业务部门和财会科联系。
    事情过去一年多了，谁也没有过问过。一九五四年第三、四季度，虽然进行了清仓排队、盘点财产、核对账货和年终决算等工作，仍然没有发现这一过错。更严重的是，去年十二月份，济南支公司发现长余元钢五十八吨，曾派人到天津采购供应站联系，他们盲目地认为自己没有错。后来，山东省商业厅又写信给天津采购供应站请他们查对一下是否短少了钢，他们仍然没有理睬这件事。一直到最近才发现这个问题。
    中国五金机械公司天津采购供应站发生商品错乱的现象已经不止一次了。一九五四年全年发生短少商品的价值共一百四十八万余元，长余商品的价值共一百四十九万余元。其中除了已经查明和作了处理的以外，查不到下落的商品计：因短少造成的损失约六十万元，盈余商品的价值有四十九万多元。
    这种手续不清、制度混乱的现象，给国家带来了很大的损失。我们希望大家都来和这种财务管理上的混乱现象作斗争，制止浪费行为，为国家节约资财。
