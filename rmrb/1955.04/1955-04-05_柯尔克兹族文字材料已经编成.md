    Kyrgyz Script Materials Have Been Compiled
    The Kyrgyz Script Research Committee of the Kizilsu Kyrgyz Autonomous Prefecture in Xinjiang Province, based on the speech patterns of the Kyrgyz people in the autonomous region, and with reference to the script of the Kyrgyz people in the Soviet Union and ancient books preserved by the Kyrgyz people, has compiled Kyrgyz script materials consisting of thirty letters after a long period of research. After discussion and revision by cadres and the masses from all walks of life in the Kyrgyz community, these script materials have been reviewed and approved by the Xinjiang Provincial Script Research Committee and passed at the third administrative meeting of the Kizilsu Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee. Currently, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Committee and the Provincial Script Research Committee have printed and distributed 1,000 copies of the Kyrgyz script materials to schools, cadres, and the masses in the autonomous prefecture for planned study.
    The Kyrgyz people originally had their own script. However, under the long-term oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary rule before liberation, they did not have the right or opportunity to use their own national script. The broad masses of the Kyrgyz people forgot their own national script and had to use Russian and Uyghur alphabets for transliteration. After the establishment of the autonomous regional people's government in July 1954, in order to realize the nationalization of the autonomous organs and develop the cultural and educational undertakings of the autonomous region, the Kyrgyz Script Research Committee was established. After more than a year of research, the Kyrgyz script materials consisting of thirty letters were compiled. (Zhang Shangyou)

    柯尔克兹族文字材料已经编成
    新疆省克兹勒苏柯尔克兹族自治区柯族文字研究委员会，根据自治区柯族人民的言语情况，参考了苏联吉尔吉斯族的文字和柯族遗存的古书，经过长时期的研究，已编成了以三十个字母组成的柯尔克兹族文字材料。这个文字材料经过柯尔克兹族各界干部、群众讨论、修改后，已经新疆省文字研究委员会审查同意，并在克兹勒苏自治州人民委员会第三次行政会议上通过。目前新疆省人民委员会和省文字研究委员会已印发了一千份柯族文字的材料给自治州的学校、干部、群众进行有计划的学习。
    柯尔克兹族人民原来有自己的文字。但在解放前国民党反动统治的长期压迫下，没有使用本民族文字的权利和机会，广大的柯尔克兹族人民忘记了本民族的文字，不得不用俄文字母和维吾尔文字母拼音。一九五四年七月自治区人民政府成立后，为了实现自治机关的民族化和发展自治区的文化教育事业，同时成立了柯族文字研究委员会，经过一年多的研究，才编成了以三十个字母组成的柯尔克兹族文字材料。　（张尚友）
