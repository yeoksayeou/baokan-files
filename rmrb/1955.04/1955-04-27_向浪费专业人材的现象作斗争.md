    Fighting Against the Waste of Professional Talent
    Qian Weichang, Provost of Tsinghua University
    It is not easy to cultivate a graduate from a university. At the university, a student must undergo four to five years of long-term education. According to the needs of different majors, they have to study more than 30 completely different courses, carry out two to three specialized production internships, five to ten course designs, and a full half-year of graduation thesis design work. They are constantly educated to love their majors, and through this education, their enthusiasm, hobbies, and hopes are fully integrated into the country's construction. Therefore, we cannot tolerate the bureaucratic attitude towards young professional talents and the rash actions of asking young people to change their majors.
    University teachers fully understand the country's need for professional cadres. In order to support the country's construction, teachers always try to restrain themselves, retain fewer teaching assistants, so that some old teachers undertake the work of two people. Especially in new disciplines where people are lacking, working more than ten hours a day is common for teachers. However, some of the user departments we support are ruthlessly wasting the talent we support. How can this not make us, the university workers, feel indignant?
    In the Soviet Union, university graduates are called experts, and experts cannot become familiar with their business in a short period of work. Therefore, in the Soviet Union, experts have the right to carry out their professional work. This is because in construction such as industry and agriculture, professional personnel have strict division of labor on the one hand, and close coordination and connection on the other hand. One person's problem often affects the whole body, resulting in a lot of waste and loss. If a bridge structure expert is not allowed to engage in bridge structure, but is required to engage in building structure, this will not only affect bridge construction work due to the lack of people in bridge structure, but also the bridge structure expert will inevitably make many mistakes in building structure, affecting the collaborative work of experts in building design, building construction, water supply and drainage, heating and ventilation, causing waste of other professional personnel's work. This is like a machine. If a gear is installed in the wrong place, the entire function of the machine will be greatly reduced, or it will not be able to be used at all. Therefore, the loss caused by unreasonable allocation of a professional talent is by no means a waste of one talent, but will cause the country to waste many talents.
    Disregarding professional training, generally believing that "university students learn basic knowledge, and there is nothing special or not," openly asking university graduates to establish the vague concept of "changing careers" fully demonstrates how backward these user departments are using the human resources concept of handicraft production to carry out socialist industrial construction. Even in the era of handicraft production, apprenticeships to learn a craft also require several months or years. This kind of employment thinking that ignores majors and scientific and technological division of labor is seriously affecting the growth of the country's technical strength, affecting the development of the country's scientific undertakings, and causing undue losses to the country's socialist construction.
    The reasons for the phenomenon of talent waste are very complicated. The main reason is that some comrades in the user departments who are responsible for allocation lack the necessary or even basic scientific and technical knowledge. At the same time, they do not humbly listen to the opinions of graduates, carefully study the uses of the majors they have learned, and understand the actual needs of the work of their units. Some working comrades still use the university education they received in the reactionary ruling era to measure today's professional teaching after teaching reform. At that time, what was indeed learned in universities was only general basic knowledge, at most it was professional basic knowledge of various disciplines, such as dividing them into electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, metallurgy, and mining. But today, after more than three years of efforts, universities have been learning from the Soviet academic system and professional expert training plans, and have carried out more reasonable and meticulous division of labor throughout the country. We have now established one hundred and sixty or seventy different majors. In the reactionary era, the semi-colonial industry had no independent production needs, so a general mechanical training was sufficient. Students graduating from the mechanical engineering department were just jacks-of-all-trades, knowing a little about everything, but not enough about anything. But our country has already entered the era of socialist construction, and we already have the conditions for carrying out the division of labor and training of professional talents. In the field of machinery, we are divided into two major categories: mechanical manufacturing and power machinery manufacturing. Each category is further divided into many, many specialties such as casting, cutting lathes, pressure processing, heat treatment, welding, automobiles, and tractors according to on-site division of labor needs, and completely different professional training is carried out. If the user departments allocate cadres every year, but fail to figure out these divisions of labor every year, then we have every reason to ask them to buy a copy of the "College Entrance Examination Guide" compiled annually by the National College Enrollment Committee from Xinhua Bookstore, because it introduces in detail and in plain language the training content and training objectives of each major, and clearly states the professional service objects of graduates of each major.
    Secondly, poor planning is also one of the main reasons for the waste of talent. User departments do not have plans in advance. When things come to a head, they reach out for people, such as the requirements for heating and ventilation majors and the requirements for electrical and electrical engineering majors, are examples.
    Of course, we are not saying that majors are absolutely unchangeable. Because at present, the professional settings and teaching content of universities cannot fully meet actual needs, and there are certain contradictions between the proportion of graduates in each major and the proportion of various talents actually needed. Moreover, technology is developing, and modern industrial construction often raises the need for unprecedented specialized talents. In order to develop new types of enterprises, the country will require some cadres to change careers and carry out completely new work. However, such career changes must be done after very careful and thorough consideration. For example, when the Soviet Union developed the construction machinery industry, it mobilized a group of construction engineers for industrial and civil buildings and a group of tractor manufacturing engineers to change careers to complete it. For another example, when the Soviet Union developed the hydropower station industry, it mobilized a group of electrical engineers to change careers to complete it. But we must point out that changing careers is a last resort and a very complex matter. Some are easy to change, and some are not easy to change. User departments should consult with schools and experts more when requiring professional talents to change careers. Moreover, it is best for the country to have a department specifically in charge of the matter of professional talents changing careers; because only in this way can the departmentalism of individual user departments be prevented, and completely unnecessary career changes can be avoided.
    Also, there are some problems in using talents according to their abilities. After the teaching reform, universities have learned from the Soviet Union's teaching methods and teaching materials, and the quality of graduates has greatly improved. Graduates from many schools and many majors across the country have formally conducted graduation design. We believe that it is absolutely necessary to require the country to give uniform technical positions to university graduates who have undergone graduation design work. Because in this way, it is easier to tap potential and overcome the phenomenon of wasting talents. In order to gain the trust of user departments, our universities fully welcome responsible comrades from user departments to participate in the graduation design defense committees of universities, and to participate in reviewing the standards and levels of graduates.
    Finally, many graduates of higher industrial schools are left in the offices of user departments to carry out administrative office work such as secretaries after being assigned work. Some people have even been working as secretaries in a certain agency since graduating in 1951, and have forgotten all their professional knowledge in the past three years. We must know that professional and technical personnel are difficult to train. After graduating from universities, they should be given practical on-site work training, so as to consolidate and develop their professional knowledge. This is absolutely necessary for the country to train young technical cadres. Otherwise, putting them only in the offices will definitely disconnect them from production practice. Do ministries and bureaus need engineers or technicians? Of course they do, but experienced engineers should be transferred from the front lines to fill these positions. As for transferring technical personnel to do general administrative work, no matter what the excuse, it cannot be reasonable.
    Today, on the one hand, the motherland needs a large number of experts and technicians, and on the other hand, there is a phenomenon of waste of talent, which is very painful. In order to safeguard the narrow interests of their units, various user departments forcibly put a pile of irrelevant hats on university graduates, suppress their opinions, and cause some useful professional talents to be wasted and idled meaninglessly. We hope that relevant units will correct these phenomena as soon as possible. But remember that such things happen every year and are criticized every year. Sometimes only criticism is not enough without organizational guarantees. We hope that the government will specifically designate a department to manage this phenomenon of waste of talent. And it should actively and publicly encourage professional personnel who are being used inappropriately to fight against this phenomenon of waste of talent, can openly encourage these personnel to write letters to this specially designated department to make accusations, and give legal protection, so that they will not suffer any damage because of making accusations. This designated special department has the right to conduct investigations and studies and handle adjustments. In these tasks, various universities are fully qualified to help this designated special department determine whether their students are being used reasonably based on their professional knowledge.

    向浪费专业人材的现象作斗争
    清华大学教务长　钱伟长
    一个高等学校的毕业生，不是随便就能够培养出来的。在高等学校里，一个学生要经过四年到五年的长期教育。他们根据不同专业的需要，要学习三十多种内容完全不同的课程，要进行两次到三次专门的生产实习，五次到十次的课程设计，和整整半年的毕业论文设计工作。他们经常受到热爱专业的教育，通过这些教育，使他们的热情、爱好和希望完全融合到国家的建设中来。因此，那种官僚主义地对待青年专业人材的态度，草率地要求青年更改专业的行动，实在是我们所不能容忍的。
    高等学校的教师们是完全了解祖国建设需要专业干部的情况的，教师们为了支援祖国的建设，总是尽量克己、少留助教，以至有些老教师，一人担当了两人的工作，尤其是缺人的新学科，一天担任十几小时的工作，对教师说来是普通的情况。但是，正是我们支援的用人部门，有的却在无情地浪费着我们支援的人材，这怎能不使我们高等学校的工作者们感到愤慨呢？
    在苏联，高等学校的毕业生称为专家，专家的业务，不是在短期工作中便能熟悉的。因此，在苏联，专家有进行他的专业工作的权利。这是因为在工业、农业等建设里，专业人员一方面有着严格的分工，另一方面又有着密切的配合和联系，一个人的问题常常会牵一发而动全身，以致造成很多的浪费和损失。假如一位学桥梁结构的专家，不让他去搞桥梁结构，而要求他去搞房屋结构，这不仅会因为在桥梁结构方面缺人，影响桥梁的建设工作；而且，这个桥梁结构的专家在搞房屋结构时也一定会毛病百出，影响房屋设计、房屋施工、上下水道、暖气通风等专家的协同工作，造成其他专业人员的工作上的浪费。这好像一架机器，一个齿轮安错了地方，这架机器的全部功能就会大大降低，或是根本不能使用。因此，一个专业人材分配不合理所造成的损失，决不是浪费了一个人材，而是会使国家浪费很多人材的。
    轻视专业训练，笼统地认为“大学生所学的是基本知识，没有什么专不专”，公开要求高等学校毕业生树立“改行思想”的胡涂观念，充分表示了这些用人单位怎样落后地用手工业生产的用人观点在进行着社会主义的工业建设。就是在手工业生产的时代，学徒学一样手艺也需要几个月或几年的时间。这种漠视专业，漠视科学技术分工的用人思想，正严重地影响着祖国技术力量的增长，影响着祖国科学事业的发展，使祖国的社会主义建设事业受到了不应有的损失。
    造成人材浪费现象的原因是很复杂的，主要是某些用人单位的负责分配工作的同志，缺乏应有的甚至是起码的科学和技术的常识，同时，他们并不虚心听取毕业生的意见，认真研究毕业生所学专业的用途，了解本单位工作的实际需要情况。有些工作同志，仍用他自己在反动统治时代所受的大学教育，来衡量今天在教学改革后的专业教学。那时确实在大学里学到的只是一般的基础知识，至多也是分科的专业基础知识，如分成电机、机械、化工、冶金、采矿等学科。但今天，高等学校经过了三年多的努力，学习着苏联的学制和专业专家的培养计划，已在全国范围内进行了较合理、较细密的分工，我们现在已经设立了一百六、七十个不同的专业。在反动时代，半殖民地性质的工业没有什么独立自主的生产需要，因此，笼统的只有什么机械的训练就足够，机械系毕业的学生，只是一只三脚猫，什么都知道一些，什么也知道得不够。但是我国业已走进了社会主义的建设的时代，我们已经有条件进行专业人材的分工培养了。在机械方面，我们分为机械制造类和动力机械制造类两大类专业。每一类专业又根据现场分工需要分成铸工、切削车床、压力加工、热处理、焊接、汽车、拖拉机等许多许多的专业，进行着完全不同的专业训练。用人部门假如年年分配干部，而又年年弄不清楚这些分工，那我们完全有必要要求他们到新华书店买一本每年全国高等学校招生委员会编制的“升学指导”，因为在那上面，就详细地、通俗地介绍了每一个专业的培养内容和培养目标，明确地写明着每一个专业的毕业生的专业服务对象。
    其次，计划不周也是人材浪费的主要原因之一。用人单位在事前没有计划，事到临头，伸手要人，譬如对暖气通风专业的要求，电机及电气专业的要求，就是一例。
    当然，我们并不是说专业是绝对不能更改的。因为在目前，高等学校专业设置及教学内容还不可能完全符合实际需要，毕业生的各专业人数之间的比例和实际需要的各种人材之间的比例还有一定矛盾。而且技术在发展，现代化工业建设常常会提出前所未有的专门人材的需要。国家为了发展新型的企业，就会要求一些干部改行，进行完全新的工作，但是，这样的改行，必须经过很慎重、很周密的考虑。譬如，苏联在发展建筑机械工业时，就是动员了一批工业民用房屋建筑的施工工程师和一批拖拉机制造工程师改行来完成的。又譬如，苏联在发展水力发电站的工业时，就是动员了一批电力工程师改行来完成的。但我们必须指出，改行是万不得已的事情，也是非常复杂的事情，有的好改，有的不好改。用人部门要求专业人材改行，应该多多同学校和专家们商量。而且，国家最好是能有一个部门专管专业人材改行的事情；因为只有这样，才能防止个别用人部门的本位主义，才能避免造成完全不必要的改行。
    还有，在量材使用上也存在着一些问题。高等学校经过了教学改革，学习了苏联的教学方法和教材内容，毕业生的质量已有很大的提高。全国有不少学校、不少专业的毕业生，已经正规地进行了毕业设计。我们认为，完全有必要要求全国给予进行过毕业设计工作的高等学校毕业生以统一规定的技术职位。因为这样，更易于发掘潜力和克服浪费人材的现象。为了取得用人部门的信任，我们高等学校完全欢迎用人部门的负责同志来参加高等学校毕业生毕业设计答辩委员会，来参加审查毕业生的标准和水平。
    最后，许多高等工业学校的毕业生在分配工作后，被用人单位留在机关里进行着像秘书等行政性的机关工作。甚至，有人从一九五一年毕业后就一直做着某机关的秘书，三年来把什么专业知识都忘光了。我们要知道，专业技术人员是很难培养的，他们在高等学校毕业后，应该给予生产现场工作的锻炼，这样才能巩固和发展他们的专业知识。这对于国家培养青年技术干部是完全必要的。否则，只把他们放在机关里，就一定会使他们脱离生产实际。部里、局里要不要工程师或技术人员呢？当然要，但是应该调现场有经验的工程师来充任。至于说调技术人员做一般性的行政工作，不论什么借口，都不能是合理的。
    今天，祖国一方面需要大批专家和技术人员，另一方面也存在着浪费人材的现象，这是使人十分痛心的事。各个用人部门为了本单位的狭隘的利益，硬给高等学校的毕业生扣上一大堆毫不相干的帽子，压制着他们的意见，使一部分有用的专业人材无为地被浪费着，闲置着，我们希望有关单位尽快地纠正这些现象。但是记得这样的事情年年发生，也年年批评。有时候只是批评，没有组织的保证是不成的。我们希望政府专门指定部门，来管理这种人材浪费的现象。并应该主动地公开鼓励凡被不适当使用的专业人员向这种浪费人材的现象进行斗争，可以公开鼓励这些人员写信给这个专门指定的部门进行控诉，并给予法律上的保障，不使因为进行控诉而受到任何损害。这个指定的专门部门，有权进行调查研究和处理调整。各个高等学校在这些工作上，是完全有条件来根据专业知识帮助这个指定的专门部门判定自己的学生是否被使用得合理的。
