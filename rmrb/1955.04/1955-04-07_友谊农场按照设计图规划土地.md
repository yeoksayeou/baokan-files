Having completed the planning and design of the State-owned Friendship Farm, the Soviet experts of the land consolidation survey team have returned to the Sandaogang Grassland from Harbin. Along with the Soviet experts are more than forty Chinese surveying personnel who had studied in the land consolidation training class of the Ministry of Agriculture. They immediately began the final stage of land consolidation work, which is to plan the rotation areas, field roads, and farm road network on the ground according to the farm planning design drawings, under the specific guidance of Soviet experts. The completion of this work will provide the necessary conditions for the comprehensive reclamation of 20,000 hectares of wasteland.

    友谊农场按照设计图规划土地
    完成了国营友谊农场规划设计的土地整理考察组的苏联专家们，已自哈尔滨回到三道岗草原。随苏联专家前来的还有曾在农业部土地整理讲习班学习过的四十多名中国勘测人员。他们立即开始了土地整理的最后一个阶段的工作。这就是在苏联专家具体指导下，按着农场规划设计图，实地规划出轮作区、田间道路及农场道路网。这一工作的完成，将给全面开垦两万公顷荒地，准备下必具的条件。
