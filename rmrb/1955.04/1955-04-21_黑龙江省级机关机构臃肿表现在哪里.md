When the provincial organs of the original Heilongjiang and Songjiang provinces were merged in August 1954, the number of personnel directly under the new provincial government increased by several hundred compared to before. The number of institutions also increased, with 48 more at the division level and 94 more division-level cadres. Was this because the provincial organs' business had expanded unprecedentedly, requiring the establishment of such institutions and the increase of personnel? Or were there unreasonable phenomena in the establishment and organization? From the following materials, we can see where the problem lies.

Before the merger of the provinces, the departments of the Provincial People's Committee were managed administratively by a secretarial section; now each department has expanded this section into an office larger than a division. For example, the Provincial People's Court has a total of 66 people, but the office accounts for 20 of them. Many of the provincial Party committee's institutions have also been expanded. For example, the Propaganda Department, the Industry Department, and the Rural Work Department have expanded from the original five or six divisions to eight divisions. Is it really necessary to have so many divisions? A deputy director of the Rural Work Department answered this question. He said, "We can certainly reduce it to five divisions." The Provincial Party Committee's Basic Construction Department has many highly specialized divisions, such as the Civil Engineering and Construction Division, the Mine Construction Division, and the Metal Structure Installation Division, whose work is not much different from that of the functional departments. The Policy Research Sections under the offices of the various departments of the Provincial People's Committee and the Policy Research Sections under the offices of the various departments of the Provincial Party Committee are even more unnecessary institutions. The reasons for establishing such sections initially were: first, to grasp the current central work, put forward policy-oriented questions and solutions; second, to draft plans and summaries for the departments and accumulate data. In fact, such requirements cannot be met. Because each policy research section has only five or six people, and its business is not as specialized as that of the relevant departments, it is impossible to put forward policy-oriented questions more quickly and appropriately than the various departments; at the same time, its work often overlaps with that of the relevant departments. If it is only for drafting documents, then it is of course even more unnecessary to establish this institution. Yang Guoxiang, the secretary of the general Party branch of the Provincial Health Department, wrote to the Party Committee of the Provincial People's Committee organs, stating that the department's policy research section had done nothing but cooperate with other bureaus and divisions to go to the countryside and factories to understand the situation since its establishment half a year ago. Therefore, he proposed that the section should be abolished. The head of the Policy Research Section of the Provincial Department of Agriculture also reflected to the personnel department: "Since the establishment of this section, I have been carrying a 'burden' for more than half a year. There is no work, and I am just sitting there. It seems leisurely, but in fact, I am mentally depressed enough, and I hope to transfer our work quickly."

The phenomenon of overlapping institutions and numerous levels, especially the overlapping of sections of the same nature, is even more serious. Taking the Provincial Department of Agriculture as an example, the department has a secretarial section, a personnel section, a finance section, and a planning section. The department's affiliated Water Conservancy Bureau and Farm Administration Bureau live together with the department, but they also have these four sections. Now, the various departments of the Provincial People's Committee not only have many divisions and many sections, but also have many groups or "stalls" established under the sections, which in fact replace the former units. In this way, from the group to the department, it is said to be four levels, but in reality, it is five layers. When handling affairs, the upper level often hands them down layer by layer, and many people at the lower level handle them perfunctorily and push them up layer by layer. Therefore, the draft of a document often passes through many hands, but the quality is still very low. At the same time, with more levels, the turnover is less flexible, which delays work. For example, documents sent by the various departments of the Provincial Party Committee to the secretary of the Provincial Party Committee for review must go through five or six procedures of receiving, sending, registering, and preliminary reading before they can be forwarded. The Provincial Party Committee's Department of Finance and Trade's circular on "The Development of the Rural Primary Grain Market and Opinions on Further Consolidating and Improving It" was drafted as early as August 1954, but after repeated circulation and revision, the final draft was not finalized until October 5. After being circulated by the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee and added with instructions, it was already November 30. After another month of printing, the issuance time was delayed until December 31. The situation checked in early autumn was not printed and distributed until late winter, which was long overdue and lost its guiding role.

When institutions are bloated and there are more cadres, many people have to work for the cadres. A vice governor said, "With more cadres in the organs, a lot of energy has to be spent on dealing with the problems of the cadres themselves or between the cadres. Because everyone will constantly have new problems and new demands in their work, thinking, and life, which must be understood and resolved. At the same time, the number of administrative personnel serving the cadres has also increased, there is not enough housing, the dining hall is crowded... problems have all come." Indeed, according to the statistics of five departments of the Provincial People's Committee, the number of people in charge of general affairs, typing, and receiving and sending accounts for one-tenth of the total number of cadres in these departments. The number of odd-job personnel in the entire provincial organs also accounts for one-tenth of the total number of personnel.

The phenomenon of bloated institutions and overstaffing in many provincial organs in Heilongjiang is obvious, but if you look at the formal establishment table, the number of people is 300 less than when there were two provinces. How is this possible? Originally, in addition to the formal establishment of each organ, there were also establishments financed from enterprise profits and operating expenses. The total number of personnel added in this way by the provincial organs in the province was 1,278. For example, the Provincial Department of Agriculture has six fishery companies under its jurisdiction. Originally, both provinces were led by the Aquatic Products Section. After the merger of the provinces, the department expanded the Aquatic Products Section into the Aquatic Products Bureau, which violated the provisions of the establishment plan. Therefore, they used the profits of the fishery companies to pay for expenses. Similarly, the salaries of cadres in the Animal Husbandry Division, Agricultural Machinery Station Administration Bureau, and Agricultural Technology Extension Division of the Provincial Department of Agriculture are all paid from the business construction funds of these areas. This opened a convenient door for arbitrarily establishing institutions and adding personnel outside the formal establishment. The Provincial Department of Agriculture alone had 452 people entering through this door, more than double the number of formally established personnel (217). Due to this situation, the number of personnel in the provincial organs has exceeded the number of personnel stipulated by the state by 57 percent. Failure to change this practice will make it impossible to control the establishment of state organs, which will inevitably lead to the phenomenon of large institutions and overstaffing.

The above issues have aroused the attention of the Heilongjiang provincial leadership. At the third administrative meeting on April 1, the Provincial People's Committee specifically studied the "Work Plan on Reorganizing Institutions and Reducing Establishments" and established a Provincial Establishment Committee, preparing to take immediate action to carry out this work.

    黑龙江省级机关机构臃肿表现在哪里
    本报记者　方青
    一九五四年八月，原黑龙江省和松江省的省级机构合并的时候，新省直属机关的人员比以前增加了几百人。机构也多起来了，处级机构就比原来多四十八个，处级干部也增加了九十四人。是省级机关业务空前扩大了，需要这样增设机构、增加人员呢？还是编制上、机构上有不合理现象呢？从下面一些材料中，就可以看出问题在哪里。
    在没有并省以前，省人民委员会的各部门都由一个秘书科管理行政工作；现在各厅都把这个科扩充为比处还大的办公室了。如省人民法院共有六十六人，可是办公室就占去二十人。省委的机构也有不少扩充，如宣传部、工业部和农村工作部都由原来的五个或六个处，扩充到八个处。究竟需要不需要这么多的处呢？农村工作部的一位副部长就回答了这个问题。他说：“我们满可以减到五个处。”省委基本建设部设有许多业务性很强的处，如土木建筑处、矿井建筑处、金属结构安装处等等，它们的工作，同业务部门没有多大区别。省人民委员会各厅办公室下面的政策研究科和省委各部办公室下面的政策研究科，更是不需要设立的机构。当初设立这种科的理由是：一、抓当前中心工作，提出带政策性的问题和解决的办法；二、给厅或部起草计划和总结，积累资料。事实上，这种要求是做不到的。因为每个政策研究科只有五、六个人，业务又不像各有关部门那样专，不可能比各部门更迅速更恰当地提出带政策性问题来；同时它的工作也经常同各有关部门重复。如果只是为了起草文件，那当然更不必要设立这个机构了。省卫生厅的中共总支书记杨国翔给省人民委员会机关党委写信，说明该厅的政策研究科成立半年以来，除了配合其他局和处下乡、下厂了解情况以外，并没有作什么工作。因而提出应该撤销这个科。省农业厅政策研究科科长也向人事部门反映：“这个科成立以来，我已经背了半年多的‘包袱’，没有工作，人在那里摆着，看来轻闲，实际上精神压抑得够受，希望赶快调调我们的工作。”
    机构重叠、层次繁多，特别是同样性质的科重叠的现象更为严重。以省农业厅为例，厅里设有秘书科、人事科、财务科、计划科，该厅所属的水利局、农场管理局和厅住在一起，但也都设有这四个科。现在省人民委员会各厅不只是处多、科多，科以下又设立了许多组或“摊”，事实上代替了过去的股。这样，从组到厅，说起来是四级，实际上是五层。办起事来上面常常是一层一层地向下交，下面有很多人又马马虎虎办一下就一层一层地向上推。因此，往往一个公文的草稿转了很多手，质量还是很低。同时，层次多了，周转就更不灵活，以致贻误工作。如省委各部送给省委书记审阅的文件，要经过五、六道收发、登记、初阅的手续才能转到。省委财经贸易部关于“农村初级粮食市场开展情况及进一步巩固提高的意见”的通报，早在一九五四年八月就写好了草稿，但经过辗转传阅修改，到十月五日才最后定稿，后经省委负责同志传阅，加上批语，已经是十一月三十日了。再经过一个月的印刷过程，发文时间就延迟到十二月三十一日。初秋检查的情况，直到冬末才印发下去，早已时过境迁，失去指导作用。
    机构臃肿了，干部多了，又要有很多人为干部做工作。一位副省长说：“机关的干部多了，就要花很大精力处理干部本身或干部之间的问题。因为每个人在工作上、思想上、生活上都会不断发生新的问题、新的要求，都要了解和解决。同时，为干部服务的行政部门的人员也增加了，房子不够住，饭厅拥挤……问题都来了。”是的，据省人民委员会五个厅的统计，属于总务、打字、收发方面的人数，就占这些厅的干部总数的十分之一。整个省级机关的勤杂人员也占全体人员的十分之一。
    黑龙江省不少省级机关机构臃肿，人浮于事的现象是显然的，但是如果从正式编制表上看去，人数却比原来两个省时少三百人。这是怎么回事呢？原来在各机关正式编制之外，还有从企业利润和事业费中开支的编制。全省省级机关用这种办法增加的人员共有一千二百七十八人。例如省农业厅下设六个渔业公司，原来两省均由水产科领导，并省以后，厅里把水产科扩充为水产局，这就违反了编制方案的规定，于是他们就由渔业公司的利润中去开支经费。同样在省农业厅的畜牧处、农业机器站管理局、农业技术推广处等部门干部的工薪，都是由这些方面的事业建设费中开支。这样就给在正式编制之外，随便设置机构，增添人员开了一个方便之门。单是省农业厅由这个门进来的竟有四百五十二人之多，超过正式编制人员（二百一十七名）一倍以上。由于这种情况，使得省级机关的人员，已经超过国家所规定的编制人数百分之五十七。不改变这种做法，就使国家机关的编制无法控制，因而也必然会产生机构庞大、人浮于事的现象。
    以上问题已经引起黑龙江省领导方面的重视。省人民委员会在四月一日第三次行政会议上，专门研究了“关于整编机构、紧缩编制的工作计划”，并成立了省编制委员会，准备立即行动起来，进行这一工作。
