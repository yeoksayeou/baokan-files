The Delegation of the Japan-China Fisheries Council presents the following views as a memorandum in accordance with the proposal of your delegation to exchange memoranda on the consultations regarding the issues in this meeting which, despite the vigorous advocacy and insistence of your delegation to the end, failed to reach a decision due to the opposition of the Japanese representatives.

	Through this friendly meeting with your delegation, the Japanese delegation has deepened mutual understanding and reached agreement on several important issues. That is, from the perspective of protecting fishery resources, rationally utilizing fishing grounds, and avoiding disputes to seek the development of production, which is in line with the interests and prosperity of the fisheries communities of both countries, we have decided on necessary, specific, and practical methods for the present.

	However, the Japanese delegation regrets that it is difficult to agree with your delegation's proposal to mutually and automatically limit the number of single-trawler fishing vessels and motorized trawl fishing vessels (hereinafter referred to as "fishing vessels") of both sides within a certain period in the waters of the Yellow Sea and the central East Sea, bounded by a line connecting the points at 34 degrees North latitude, 123 degrees East longitude, 34 degrees North latitude, 124 degrees East longitude, 33 degrees North latitude, 124 degrees East longitude, and 33 degrees North latitude, 123 degrees East longitude.

	To this, the Japanese delegation has put forward the following arguments:

	Because this area is a general fishing ground over a vast sea, there is little competition between the fishing vessels of the two countries even during the fishing season. Secondly, through this meeting, friendly operations of fishing vessels of the two countries have become possible. At the same time, if the spirit of the agreement is implemented in the Japanese fishing industry, it is expected that Japanese fishing vessels will pay further attention to the selection of fishing grounds and disperse widely across various fishing grounds.

	Based on various circumstances, we believe that the number of Japanese fishing vessels operating simultaneously in the aforementioned waters will be approximately fifty to sixty pairs. Considering the conditions of the fishing grounds in this area, it cannot be considered that Japanese fishing vessels will be excessively concentrated in narrow areas. Therefore, the Japanese delegation believes that it will not occur in fact, as your delegation claims, that Japanese fishing vessels will monopolize the fishing grounds in the area or exclude the operations of Chinese fishing vessels.

	To this, your delegation argues:

	The Japanese delegation says fifty to sixty pairs, but in the past, there have been instances of more than one hundred pairs of Japanese fishing vessels operating in the area at the same time. This area is also an extremely important fishing ground for China. During the four months of October, November, and January and February of the following year, seventy to one hundred pairs of Chinese fishing vessels go there to fish. Therefore, if the two sides do not impose some restrictions, not only will fierce competition inevitably occur between the fishing vessels of the two countries, but disputes may arise due to competition, and Chinese fishing vessels will be overwhelmed by the superior Japanese fishing vessels and unable to complete their production. In order to eliminate this concern, it should be demarcated as a fishing zone, and the number of fishing vessels on both sides should be rationally arranged.

	However, the Japanese delegation, considering the above reasons and international impact, has been unable to agree to this point.

	Of course, from the standpoint of promoting friendship between the fisheries communities of Japan and China, the Japanese delegation has paid full attention to the spirit of your proposal.

	In addition, the Japanese delegation wishes to specifically state here that it will make the utmost effort to faithfully abide by Annex II of the agreement, "Regulations on Maintaining Order in Fishing Vessel Operations."

	At the same time, the Japanese delegation firmly believes that not only in the aforementioned waters but also in all fishing grounds of the vast Yellow Sea and East Sea, fishing vessels of Japan and China will mutually observe operational discipline and maintain order based on the spirit of good faith and honesty. In view of the course of this meeting, the Japanese delegation earnestly hopes to cooperate with your delegation to make the achievements of the meeting more meaningful.

	Respectfully,

	To the Delegation of the China Fisheries Association of the People's Republic of China

	Head of Delegation: Mr. Yang Yu

	Deputy Head of Delegation: Mr. Gao Shuyi

	Delegation of the Japan-China Fisheries Council of Japan

	Head of Delegation: Sueyoshi Shichida

	Deputy Head of Delegation: Sataro Murayama

### 日本日中渔业协议会代表团致中国渔业协会代表团的备忘录

    日本日中渔业协议会代表团致中国渔业协会代表团的备忘录
  根据贵方代表团关于将这次会谈中虽经贵方代表团热烈主张并坚持至最后，但由于日本代表的反对而未能取得决定的问题的协商经过，作为备忘录进行交换的建议，日本代表团表明见解如下。
    日本代表团通过这次和贵方代表团的友好会谈，加深了相互的理解，同时，就若干重要问题也取得了意见的一致。这就是从保护渔业资源、合理地利用渔场、避免纠纷以求生产的发展，是符合两国渔业界的利益和繁荣的观点出发，在双方之间，决定了目前必要的、具体的并且切实可行的方法。
    但是日本代表团很遗憾地难以同意贵方代表团希望在黄海、东海中部以北纬三四度、东经一二三度之点，北纬三四度、东经一二四度之点，北纬三三度、东经一二四度之点，北纬三三度、东经一二三度之点连结线的海域，在一定的期限内，互相自动地限定双方的单拖渔轮和机船拖网渔轮（以下简称“渔船”）的作业船数的建议。
    对此，日本代表团曾提出如下主张。
    由于这方面的海域是广大海面的普遍性渔场，即使在渔汛期，两国渔船的竞争亦很少。其次经过此次会谈，两国渔船的友好作业成为可能，同时如在日本渔业界贯彻了协定的精神，预计日本渔船对渔场的选择将予以进一步的注意，在各个渔场广泛地分散开来。
      根据各种情况判断，我们认为今后日本渔船在上述海域同时进行作业的船数约为五十对到六十对，从这方面的渔场状况来看，不能认为日本渔船会过度地集中到狭窄的区域去。因此日本代表团相信在事实上不致发生，如贵方代表团所称：日本渔船会垄断该海域的渔场或排斥中国渔船的作业的情况。
    对此，贵方代表团主张说：
    日本代表团说是五、六十对，但在过去曾发生过在同一时间内有一百对以上日本渔船在该海域作业的事实。该海域对于中国也是极其重要的渔场，在十月、十一月以及翌年一月、二月的四个月间，有七十对至一百对的中国渔船前往捕鱼。因此，如双方不加某种限制，不但在两国渔船间一定将发生激烈竞争，由于竞争而可能引起纠纷，而且中国渔船将为优势的日本渔船所压倒，不能完成其生产。为了消除这种顾虑，应该把它区划为一个渔区，并合理地安排双方渔船的船数。
    但是日本代表团考虑到上述理由和国际上的影响，未能同意这一点。
    当然，日本代表团从增进日中两国渔业界的友好的立场出发，对贵方提案的精神已加以充分的注意。
    此外日本代表团愿特别在此表明，将为切实遵守协定附件二“关于维持渔船作业秩序的规定”而尽最大的努力。
    同时，日本代表团深信不仅在上述海域，而且在广阔的黄海、东海的所有渔场，日中两国的渔船将相互根据信义诚实的精神，遵守作业上的纪律，维持秩序。日本代表团鉴于这次会谈的经过，热望和贵方代表团相互合作，以使会谈的成就更有意义。
    此致
