A "Automated" Factory
Bai Yuan

	In Bengbu city, on the banks of the Huai River, there is a long road. You don't need to ask for directions or the street number; just follow the carts that scatter wheat grains as they move, and you can walk straight into a spacious gate. This is the Bao Xing Flour Factory, a local state-owned enterprise in Anhui Province.

	That day, with a sense of responsibility born from the interconnectedness of human lives, I visited this place with two comrades who worked in grain management. The factory director was not in. A deputy director led us down from the factory director's office building. Not far away, there was a main road leading to the various factory buildings, almost entirely paved with wheat grains. As we walked along the road, a continuous stream of trucks passed by, scattering wheat grains from the vehicles. The grains spilled into the light railway tracks and from the road we walked on, all the way into the roadside ditches. It was truly a strange sight! Did people harvest wheat from the fields just to use it as a substitute for sand to pave roads?

	Walking along, we arrived at a large building. The deputy director said, "This is the warehouse." Actually, it was obvious. The large building was packed full. Bags of flour, packaged in white cloth bags, were piled together with sacks of wheat wrapped in hemp, all covered in sand. But just the flour alone was considerable, all produced by the factory. The deputy director told us that there were over 24,000 bags of flour in total. However, upon further inquiry, we learned that it couldn't be sold. If you took a pinch of flour from those bags and put it in your mouth, the sand would grind against your teeth with a gritty sound. Originally, there weren't just 24,000 bags of this kind of flour, but more than 35,000 bags (the wheat used to produce this flour totaled 2,169,300 catties). Because the flour contained too much sand, it was inedible, and no one wanted to spend money to suffer through such flour. So, according to the "merchant's way," the factory mixed over 10,000 bags into some good flour and sold it. Furthermore, based on the principle of "as long as we have wine to drink every day, who cares if you go hungry," they also took more than 400 bags from the factory to make liquor. But even so, the warehouse was still almost completely full.

	"Look," one of my fellow comrades said to me.

	When I looked, I saw many sparrow droppings scattered on the bags of flour. The droppings were white and fine, and you wouldn't notice them unless you looked closely.

	Suddenly, everyone was reminded to look up, and we saw a lively world under the high roof: countless sparrows, large and small, flew back and forth from one corner of the room to the other, singing songs of happy living. The deputy director told us:

	"Before, there were even pigeons."

	I said, "How do so many sparrows fly in?"

	"Yes," our deputy director said, "except when moving flour, the warehouse doors are not opened all day; the windows are also rarely opened, and there is even a layer of wire mesh nailed outside."

	Indeed, you see, there was a layer of wire mesh nailed outside each window. So, how did the sparrows fly in?

	However, if you looked closely, you would see the trick: it turned out that the sparrows had filled the gaps between the tiles and bricks with nests. They had settled down here and made it their home long ago, living an abundant life. So they reproduced generation after generation; old sparrows gave birth to young sparrows, and young sparrows grew up and gave birth to more young sparrows, passing it down through the generations. Finally, they multiplied into such a large "family," and they didn't fly in from anywhere!

	Well then, goodbye, sparrows, I envy your lives.

	Having arrived at the factory, we naturally had to visit the workshop, so the deputy director led us inside. The machines roared. This flour factory was not only the largest in Anhui Province, but also the best-equipped. In the workshop, one machine was connected to the next. As long as wheat was poured into the first machine, the finished flour could be poured out of the last one. People here call their factory an "automated" factory, which is certainly a good thing. But the people working in this factory seemed to be completely "automated" as well. Although there were many slogans posted on the walls of the workshop, none of them mentioned labor discipline. On the walls of the workshop, there was also a slogan full of "automation" spirit:

	"How are your guarantee conditions coming along? Can you conduct inspections?"

	It could be seen that this slogan had been posted on the wall for a long time, and perhaps no one had ever answered it; perhaps, someone had answered, but they answered like this:

	"Excuse me, please wait a moment, my guarantee conditions cannot be inspected yet."

	As we walked out of the workshop, we heard the sparrows chirping in the warehouse again. I thought, let's answer that slogan:

	White flour turns to sparrow droppings,
	Wheat covers the ground like mud,
	Regardless of can or cannot,
	Inspections must come quickly!

### 一个“自动化”的工厂

    一个“自动化”的工厂
    白原
    在淮河边上的蚌埠市里，有条长长的马路。不用打听地点，也不用打听门牌的号数，你沿着这一条撒着麦粒的马路，跟随着那些搬运工人的一边走着一边洒着麦粒的车子，就可以一直走进一座宽敞的大门。这就是安徽省地方国营的宝兴面粉工厂。
    那一天，我带着一种因为人与人之间的生活的关联而引起的责任心，和两位做粮食管理工作的同志一同到这里来拜访。正厂长不在家。一位副厂长领我们走下那一座厂长办公室的楼房。没有多远，就是一条通往各个厂房去的大道，道面上几乎全是用麦粒铺成。我们一边在道上走，连续不断的搬运车子经过我们身边把麦粒从车子上洒下来。麦粒洒到了轻便铁道的轨道里，从我们所走过的道面上一直洒到道旁的阴沟里面。这真是一幅奇异的景象呵！人们从田地里打下了麦子，难道是为了用来代替沙土去铺垫道路？
    走着走着，我们就走到了一座大房子里。副厂长说：“这是仓库。”其实不用说，一看就知道了。一座大房子堆得满满的。一袋一袋的用白布袋子包装好的面粉，和那些粘满沙土的一个个麻包装着的麦子堆在一起。可是，光是面粉，也就不少了，全是厂里生产出来的呢。副厂长告诉我们说，光是面粉一共就有两万四千多袋。可是往下一打听，却是销售不出去的。你如果从那些面口袋里抓一撮面粉放到嘴里去试试，满嘴的沙子就会和你的牙齿磨得格格地响。像这样的面粉，原来还不是两万四千多袋，而是三万五千多袋（用来生产这些面粉的麦子一共就是二百一十六万九千三百多斤）。因为面粉里的沙子太多，没法吃，谁也不愿意拿钱来消受这样的面粉。于是，按照“商人之道”，厂里把一万多袋掺到一部分好面粉里卖出去了。此外，根据“只要有酒朝朝醉，那管你们饿肚皮”的原则，又从厂里拉了四百多袋去做了酒。可是，就是这样，仓库里也还剩下几乎满满的一仓库。
    “你瞧，……”一位和我同来的同志对我说。
    待我一瞧，在那一袋袋的面粉袋上撒着许多的麻雀屎。那些麻雀屎又白又细，你不仔细就会瞧不见的。
    于是，这才一下子把大家提醒过来，抬头一看，原来在那高高的屋顶下面，还有那么一个热闹的世界：无数大大小小的麻雀从一个屋角到另一个屋角，来回地飞舞着，唱着幸福的生活之歌。副厂长告诉我们说：
    “前一个时候，还有鸽子呢。”
    我说：“怎么飞进来这么多的麻雀？”
    “是呀，”我们的副厂长说，“除了拉面粉的时候，仓库的门整天不开；窗户也不常开，而且外面还钉了一层铁丝网。”
    对呀，你看，一个个窗户外面的确钉了一层铁丝网。那么，麻雀是怎样飞进来的呢？
    可是，只要你仔细一看，就看出巧妙来了：原来那些麻雀都在瓦缝里和砖缝里做满了窝，不知从什么时候起，它们就在这里安下了家，过着丰足的生活，于是就一代一代地生养起来，老麻雀生了小麻雀，小麻雀长大了又生了小麻雀，世代相传，终于繁殖了这样一个庞大的“家族”，并不是从什么地方飞进来的呵！
      那么，再见吧，麻雀，我羡慕你们的生活。
    到了工厂，自然要到车间里去看看，于是副厂长就领我们走进了车间。机器轰隆隆地响着。这个面粉厂，不仅是安徽省最大的一个面粉厂，而且也是设备最好的一个面粉厂。车间里一架机器连接着一架机器，只要把麦子从头一架机器里倒进去，做好的面粉就可以从最末的一架机器里倒出来。这里的人们管自己的厂叫“自动化”的工厂，这当然好得很。可是在这个工厂里工作的人，好像也都是完全“自动化”了的。虽然在车间的墙壁上也贴着许多的标语，但没有一条标语提到劳动纪律的事情。在车间的墙壁上，还贴有一条充满着“自动化”精神的标语：
      “你的保证条件做得怎样，可以进行检查了吗？”
      可以看出，这一条标语已经在墙壁上贴得很久了，也许从来就没有人作过回答；也许，回答是有人回答了，只是这样地回答：
    “劳您的驾，请等一等吧，我的保证条件还不能检查。”
    我们从车间里走出来，又听得仓库里的麻雀在喳喳叫。我想，对于那条标语，我们来回答一下吧：
    白面变了麻雀屎，
    麦子遍地当泥沙，
    不管可以不可以，
    应当快快来检查！
