Obstacles to the Development of Normal Trade in Asian and African Countries
Li Gao

One of the common problems facing the peoples of Asian and African countries today is to develop normal trade relations based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, and according to each other's needs and possibilities, in order to establish and expand mutually beneficial economic cooperation.

In the years following World War II, the trade between many Asian and African countries and the People's Republic of China rapidly recovered and developed. In 1950, Sino-Japanese trade had increased many times over what it was at the end of the war; in the same year, the trade volume between China and Burma, Thailand, etc., recovered to near the pre-war (1937) level. Trade between other Asian and African countries also developed. According to United Nations statistics, the exports of India, Burma, Ceylon, Pakistan, Malaya and other countries to Indonesia, Japan, Thailand, the Philippines and the Middle East increased by 41 percent in 1950 compared to 1948. Many Asian and African countries had considerable trade surpluses.

However, in order to obstruct the peaceful construction being carried out by the Chinese people and to facilitate its own foreign economic expansion, the United States hijacked the United Nations General Assembly in May 1951 to illegally pass the so-called "embargo on strategic materials" resolution. In October of the same year, the U.S. Congress passed the so-called "Battle Act," forcing many countries to restrict or even cut off trade relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries. At the same time, the United States adopted piratical means, colluding with and instructing the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to constantly intercept merchant ships on the high seas in order to disrupt navigation and trade between various countries and China. This despicable "embargo" did not prevent the recovery and development of China's economy, but it did adversely affect the foreign trade of many Asian and African countries.

The U.S. "embargo" policy seriously damaged the traditional and natural economic ties between some countries and China. These ties occupied a very important position in their national economies. For example, Japan, which was short of coking coal, iron sand, salt, soybeans and other important imports, had always obtained most of its cheap supplies from China in close proximity; its many industrial products also had a broad sales market in China. However, after the United States forced Japan to impose an embargo on China, this beneficial economic exchange was obstructed, becoming one of the fundamental reasons for Japan's serious foreign trade crisis.

The Indonesian "Independence Daily" once pointed out that the purpose of the U.S. "embargo" policy was to "force the prices of products in Southeast Asian countries to fall, so that the United States becomes the only buyer, and can naturally devour the local products of Southeast Asian countries at will." This is exactly the case. In the Asian and African region, there are many countries that still rely on exporting a few varieties of raw materials as the main source of foreign exchange income. They hope to expand the sales market for these products and obtain stable and reasonable prices. However, the United States has included many important raw material commodities produced in Asian and African countries, such as natural rubber, petroleum, tin, and many other non-ferrous metals, on the "embargo list," forcing the producing countries to prohibit or obstruct the sale of these products to the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries. In this way, in the context of a general crisis in capitalist countries' trade, the United States was able to use its advantages in the capitalist world market to monopolize the market for these products. After controlling their prices, the United States then adopted measures such as stopping purchases and restricting domestic consumption to suppress prices. As a result, Asian and African countries, especially Southeast Asian countries that rely on these products as their main trade items, have suffered incalculable damage in recent years.

Some other major products of some countries in the Asian and African region, such as rice and cotton, although not included on the U.S. "embargo list," have also been seriously affected by the "embargo." This is because, on the one hand, the "embargo" disrupted normal international trade relations, weakening the purchasing power of many countries that import these commodities; on the other hand, the United States took advantage of the economic difficulties faced by some countries due to the U.S.'s forced "embargo," and used agreements signed with them that facilitated the dumping of American goods, in the form of "aid" and "loans," to dump large quantities of surplus agricultural products in the traditional markets of Asian and African countries, thus robbing many sales markets from cotton and grain producing countries in the Asian and African region.

Due to the above factors, many Asian and African countries have experienced shrinking foreign markets and trade depression, resulting in a series of economic consequences. For example, the export value of Japan's main exports (cotton yarn, cotton fabrics, silk fabrics, rayon fabrics, steel materials, non-ferrous metals) decreased by 102 billion yen in 1953 compared to 1951. During the same period, the import value of its main imports (cereals, soybeans, cotton, metal ores and fuels) increased by 64.6 billion yen. Japan has suffered serious trade deficits for years. In the four years from 1951 to 1954, the accumulated trade deficit reached 3.3 billion U.S. dollars, equivalent to 60 percent of the total exports in the same period. Textile products, which accounted for more than 50 percent of Japan's total export value before the war, saw a 43 percent increase in inventory in the production sector in the first eight months of 1954 due to poor sales. 649 textile companies went bankrupt that year, causing massive unemployment.

The foreign exchange income of countries in the Asian and African region that export raw materials has generally decreased. According to statistics published by the United Nations, the export value of Asia and Africa (excluding the Soviet Union, people's democratic countries and Japan) decreased by 15 percent in 1952 compared to 1951. Indonesia, which mainly exports rubber, petroleum, and tin, saw its total export value decrease by 22 percent in 1952 compared to 1951; and another 10 percent in 1953 compared to 1952. Due to difficulties in selling major exports, production was also affected. The output of Indonesian private rubber plantations decreased by 34 percent in 1953 compared to 1951. Egypt and Pakistan were both forced to cut cotton production.

However, the United States has greatly expanded its colonialist plunder of the Asian and African region.

From the perspective of suppressing the purchase price of raw materials, the United States has extracted an unknown amount of wealth from the people of Asia and Africa every year. For example, the United States consumes an average of more than 500,000 tons of natural rubber annually in recent years, almost all of which is obtained from the Asian and African region. From 1951 to February 1954, the price of New York rubber (No. 1 smoked sheet) was suppressed by 73 percent. According to data from the British Natural Rubber Bureau, the drop in rubber prices reduced the income of rubber producers in Southeast Asia by 575 million U.S. dollars in 1953 alone. At the same time, the United States took the opportunity to dump surplus commodities in the Asian and African region, transferring its economic crisis to others. Compared to 1950, the United States' exports to Japan and Southeast Asia doubled in 1954. At a time when many Asian and African countries were experiencing difficulties in selling agricultural products, the United States dumped 203.3 million U.S. dollars worth of surplus agricultural products in Southeast Asia and the Middle East in 1954 alone, under the so-called "Agricultural Trade Development Act." The United States even forced Pakistan, a cotton-producing country already experiencing difficulties in selling cotton, to purchase large quantities of "U.S. aid" cotton.

Using the favorable position in trade created by the "embargo" and the economic difficulties of some countries, the United States held "U.S. aid" in one hand and the "Battle Act" in the other, forcing them to subordinate their foreign trade to the purpose of U.S. aggression and plunder. The famous Japanese economist and professor at Osaka University, Sadajiro Uekabayashi, wrote in the November 1953 issue of "Domei Times": "Japan's trade is now entirely trade under U.S. control. … Japan is merely a colony of the United States, and its trade is controlled under conditions that do not harm the interests of U.S. capital, no, it should be said under conditions that are beneficial to U.S. capital."

The above facts prove that the U.S. "embargo" and predatory trade policies have become one of the important means for it to implement its neo-colonialist plan, enslave, and plunder the people of the Asian and African region. Therefore, the voice of the people of Asian and African countries opposing this policy of the United States and demanding the development of normal trade relations is becoming increasingly louder. From Japan to the Mediterranean, this voice has developed into an irresistible and powerful force.

With the joint efforts of the broad masses of the people and the governments of many countries, trade between countries in the Asian and African region has recently made some progress despite U.S. obstruction. For example, India, Ceylon, Indonesia, Burma, and Pakistan have all signed trade agreements or contracts with China. Commercial and industrial groups from China and Japan have also signed two trade agreements and are currently conducting negotiations to expand trade. India, Afghanistan, Iran, Lebanon, Egypt, and other countries, have all established trade relations with the Soviet Union. More and more business circles in many other countries are conducting trade and mutual visits with the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries.

Facts have also proven that developing normal trade relations between Asian and African countries is beneficial to each other. For example, Ceylon, by developing trade with China based on exchanging rubber for rice, and by signing a rice contract with Burma, solved the difficulties it had encountered in 1952 of simultaneously experiencing difficulties in rubber sales and rice supply, and guaranteed an adequate supply of rice for the next three years. Its rubber production and sales situation has also been better than other rubber-producing countries in recent years. The recent development of trade relations between Burma and China, India, and Ceylon has also been beneficial to it in solving the difficulties of rice accumulation and obtaining supplies of industrial equipment, industrial materials, and daily necessities. Egyptian Minister of Finance, Emari, once pointed out that increasing trade with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries "has improved Egypt's trade and financial situation." India's further cooperation with the Soviet Union in economic technology, developed from strengthening trade links, is an even more enlightening example. India's "National Herald" commented on the five-year trade agreement signed between India and the Soviet Union in 1953, saying: "Since this trade agreement expands overseas markets, it will at least reduce our dependence on British and American employers who manipulate prices by taking advantage of the situation." In February of this year, India also signed an agreement with the Soviet Union for the latter to help India establish a huge joint metallurgical plant with an annual output of one million tons of steel. This kind of cooperation obviously has an important role in India's development of its own independent national industry. The reason why trade developed with the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries is beneficial to the other party's economy is because our foreign trade is based on mutual benefit, it does not come with any harsh conditions, it adapts to the needs of both trading parties, and it is completely equal and fair.

We firmly believe that because the people of Asian and African countries have a deep desire for cooperation and mutual assistance, because some countries in this region, such as the Soviet Union, have established advanced and highly developed industry and agriculture, China is also victoriously implementing its Five-Year Plan, and the industrial and agricultural production of India, Indonesia, Burma, Egypt and other countries has also recently made progress, the development of trade relations and economic cooperation between Asian and African countries has full potential and a bright future. The development of this relationship will not only promote the economic welfare of the people of all countries and advance the economic construction of all countries, but will also contribute to enhancing the friendship and mutual understanding of the people of all countries, and to expanding the area of peace and safeguarding the cause of peace.

    亚非各国发展正常贸易的障碍
    李高
    亚非国家人民当前面临的共同问题之一，就是根据平等互利的原则，根据彼此的需要和可能，发展正常的贸易关系，以建立和扩大对彼此有利的经济合作。
    在第二次大战后某些年份，亚非许多国家同中华人民共和国的贸易迅速地恢复和发展。在一九五○年，中日贸易比大战刚结束时已增加了许多倍；同年中国同缅甸、泰国等的贸易额恢复到接近战前（一九三七年）的水平。其他亚非国家之间的贸易来往也有发展，据联合国的统计数字，印度、缅甸、锡兰、巴基斯坦、马来亚等国对印度尼西亚、日本、泰国、菲律宾和中东各国的输出额，一九五○年比一九四八年增长了百分之四十一。许多亚非国家有相当大的出超。
    但是，美国为了阻挠我国人民所进行的和平建设，和便利它的对外经济扩张，一九五一年五月劫持联合国大会非法通过了所谓“禁运战略物资”案，同年十月美国国会又通过所谓“巴特尔法案”，强使许多国家限制以至断绝了同苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家的贸易关系。同时，美国又采取海盗手段，协同和指使蒋介石卖国集团，在公海上不断拦截商船，以破坏各国同我国来往的航行和贸易。这种可耻的“禁运”并没有能够妨碍我国经济的恢复和发展，却使许多亚非国家的对外贸易受到了不利影响。
    美国的“禁运”政策严重破坏了有些国家同中国的传统的自然的经济联系。这种联系在它们的国民经济生活中占有极重要的地位。例如日本，它所短少的炼焦煤、铁砂、盐、大豆和其他一些重要输入品，向来大部分就近从中国取得便宜的供应；它的许多种工业产品，在中国也有宽阔的销售市场。但在美国强迫日本对中国禁运之后，这种有利的经济交流受到了障碍，成为日本对外贸易严重危机的根本原因之一。
    印度尼西亚“独立报”曾经指出：美国的“禁运”政策的目的是“迫使东南亚各国产品价格降落，美国成为唯一买主，自然可以随心所欲地吞吃东南亚各国土产。”事实正是这样，在亚非地区，有许多国家目前还是依靠输出少数品种的原料为外汇收入的主要来源的。它们希望扩大这些产品的销售市场，取得稳定的合理的价格。但是美国把亚非国家出产的许多重要原料商品，如天然橡胶、石油、锡及其他许多有色金属，都列入“禁运名单”，强迫禁止或阻挠出产国把这些产品向苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家销售。这样，在资本主义国家贸易普遍发生危机的情况下，美国得以借其在资本主义世界市场上的优势，垄断这些产品的市场。美国在控制了它们的价格之后，就又采取了停购以及限制国内消费等措施来压价。这样，就使亚非各国，特别是依靠这些产品为主要贸易项目的东南亚各国，几年来遭受了难以计算的损害。
    亚非地区有些国家的另一些主要产品，如大米、棉花，虽然没有被美国列入“禁运名单”，但也受到“禁运”的严重影响。因为，一方面，“禁运”打乱了正常的国际贸易关系，使得销纳这些商品的许多国家的购买力削弱了；另一方面，美国又利用某些国家由于美国强行“禁运”所加深的经济困难，利用同它们签订的便利美货倾销的协定，假借“援助”、“贷款”等形式，在亚非国家的传统市场上大量抛售剩余农产品，这样，它就抢走了亚非地区棉粮出产国的许多销售市场。
    由于上述这些因素，使得许多亚非国家国外市场收缩，贸易萧条，因而引起了一系列的经济恶果。例如，日本的几种主要输出品（棉纱、棉织物、丝织物、人造丝织物、钢铁材、非铁金属）的出口价额一九五三年比一九五一年减少了一千零二十亿日元。而同一时期它的几种主要输入品（谷类、大豆、棉花、金属矿和燃料）的入口价额增涨了六百四十六亿日元。日本连年入超严重，从一九五一到一九五四的四年中，贸易入超累积达三十三亿美元之多，相当于同期各年出口总和的百分之六十。战前占日本出口总值百分之五十以上的纺织产品，由于销售不畅，生产部门的存货在一九五四年头八个月就增加了百分之四十三。纺织公司在这一年中倒闭了六百四十九家，造成大量工人失业。
    亚非地区输出原料的国家的外汇收入，普遍减少了。据联合国发表的统计，亚非两洲（除苏联、人民民主国家和日本）出口额在一九五二年就比一九五一年减少了百分之十五。以输出橡胶、石油、锡等为主的印度尼西亚，出口总值一九五二年比一九五一年减少了百分之二十二；而一九五三年又比一九五二年减少了百分之十强。由于主要输出品销售困难，生产也受了影响，印度尼西亚的民间橡胶园，在一九五三年的产量比一九五一年减少了百分之三十四。埃及和巴基斯坦都曾被迫削减棉花生产。
    可是，美国却大大扩张了它对亚非地区的殖民主义掠夺。
    从压价收购原料方面，美国每年不知吸取了亚非人民多少膏血。例如美国近年平均每年消耗五十多万吨天然橡胶，几乎全部是从亚非地区取得的。从一九五一年到一九五四年二月，纽约橡胶（一号烟胶）价格被压低了百分之七十三。据英国天然橡胶局的材料，橡胶跌价在一九五三年一年中就使东南亚的橡胶生产者减少了五亿七千五百万美元的收入。同时，美国乘机向亚非地区倾销剩余商品，把它的经济危机转嫁到别人头上。以一九五四年和一九五○年相比，美国向日本和东南亚的输出额增加了一倍。正当许多亚非国家的农产品销售感到困难的时候，美国在一九五四年仅根据所谓“农产品贸易发展法案”，就向东南亚和中东倾销了二亿零三百三十万美元的剩余农产品。美国甚至对巴基斯坦这样已经感到棉花滞销了的产棉国，也硬要它购买了大量“美援”棉花。
    美国利用“禁运”所造成的美国贸易上的有利地位和一些国家的经济困难，一手拿着“美援”，一手拿着“巴特尔法案”，强迫它们把对外贸易服从于美国的侵略和掠夺的目的。日本著名经济学家，大阪大学教授上林贞治郎在一九五三年十一月号“同盟时报”上写道：“日本的贸易现在已全部变成了美国管制下的贸易。……日本只是作为美国的殖民地，其贸易是在不损害美国资本的利益的条件下，不，应该说是在有利于美国资本的条件下而被管制着的。”
    上述事实证明：美国的“禁运”和掠夺性的贸易政策，已成为它在亚非地区推行新殖民主义计划、奴役和掠夺亚非地区人民的重要手段之一。因此，亚非各国人民反对美国这种政策，要求发展正常贸易关系的呼声愈来愈高涨。从日本直到地中海，这种呼声已发展成为一种不可抗拒的强大力量。
    在广大人民和许多国家政府的共同努力之下，亚非地区各国间的贸易最近不顾美国的阻挠取得了一些进展。例如印度、锡兰、印度尼西亚、缅甸和巴基斯坦，都同中国签订了贸易协定或合同。中、日两国的工商团体也签订了两次贸易协定，现在正在进行扩大贸易的谈判。印度、阿富汗、伊朗、黎巴嫩、埃及等国，都和苏联建立了贸易关系。其他许多国家的工商界同苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家进行贸易和相互访问的也越来越多了。
    事实也已证明，亚非各国发展正常贸易关系，对于彼此都是有利的。例如锡兰，由于发展了同中国的以互换橡胶、大米为主的贸易，并同缅甸签订了大米合同，这就解决了它在一九五二年曾遭遇的橡胶销售和大米供应同时感到的困难，并保证了今后三年都能得到充足的大米供应，这几年它的橡胶产销情况也比其他产胶国为好。缅甸最近同中国、印度、锡兰之间的贸易关系的发展，也有利于它解决大米积压的困难，并获得工业装备、工业器材和日用必需品的供应。埃及财政大臣艾马利曾经指出，增加对苏联和人民民主国家的贸易，“使埃及的贸易和财政情况得到改善”。印度同苏联由加强贸易联系发展了经济技术上的进一步合作，更是有启发性的例子。印度“国民先驱报”在评论一九五三年印度同苏联签订的五年贸易协定时说：“由于这个贸易协定扩大了海外市场，它至少会使我们减少对于英美那样的利用局势操纵物价的顾主的依赖性。”今年二月，印度又同苏联签订了由后者帮助印度建立一个年产一百万吨钢的巨大联合冶金工厂的协定。这种合作对于印度发展自己独立的民族工业，显然有重要的作用。同苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家发展的贸易之所以有利于贸易对方的经济，是因为我们的对外贸易，是建立在互利的基础上的，它不附带任何苛刻的条件，它适应于贸易双方的需要，并且是完全平等和公平的。
    我们深信，由于亚非各国人民有着深切的合作互助的愿望，由于这一地区的一些国家，如苏联已建立了先进的高度发展的工农业，中国也在胜利地执行着五年建设计划，印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、埃及等国的工业和农业生产最近也有进展，亚非各国之间发展贸易关系和进行经济合作是具有充分的潜力和远大前途的。这种关系的发展，不仅将促进各国人民的经济福利，推进各国的经济建设，并将为增进各国人民的友谊和相互了解，为扩大和平地区、保卫和平的事业作出贡献。
