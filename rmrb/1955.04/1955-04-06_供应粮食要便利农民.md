    Grain Supply Should Be Convenient for Farmers
    Ruilin
    Recently, some places in Hunan Province inspected grain supply work and discovered some things that made it very inconvenient for farmers to buy grain. These things have caused dissatisfaction among farmers. Farmers said, "The state's unified grain purchase and supply policy is good, but every time we buy grain, we have to travel many roads and wait a long time. It's really too troublesome." Some said, "Every time I go to buy grain, I get angry when I see the bureaucratic attitude of the salesperson."
    The reason why these farmers are dissatisfied is mainly because some grain supply departments, for their own convenience, do not provide convenience to the farmers, and arbitrarily stipulate some unreasonable so-called grain purchase systems. Some places stipulate that farmers cannot buy grain for the next month, or even can only buy grain for ten days at a time. Some grain supply departments added many troublesome procedures when selling grain, and did not allow purchasing on behalf of others with vouchers. As a result, when buying grain, farmers had to line up in long queues, and even after waiting for a day and a half, they were not necessarily able to buy grain. In the past, more than 1,000 people stood in line every day in front of the Mengxi Market supply point in the Ninth District of Lixian County, and 40 to 50 people were unable to buy grain every day. The Seventh District of Changning County once rigidly stipulated that grain for the next month would not be sold at the end of the month. Farmers walked from far away to the supply point to request a little flexibility, but the salesperson said, "This is the system. If you want to buy grain, come back tomorrow." Systems like this have added a lot of trouble to the farmers.
    This approach, which lacks a mass perspective, is also reflected in the fact that some grain supply departments have set up too few supply points; farmers have to travel dozens of miles to buy grain once. In Longshan County, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, there are 189 townships, but only 24 fixed supply points have been set up. Farmers in two townships have to travel 90 li back and forth to buy grain once. Some areas have decided to set up more supply points and adopt the "dead warehouse, live point" method to facilitate farmers' grain purchases. However, some cadres in grain supply departments are unwilling to travel more and are not actively setting up mobile supply points.
    These facts show that some cadres in grain supply departments lack the spirit of serving the masses. Some salespersons have examined their own thinking and said, "In the past, I didn't pay any attention to service attitude at all. I thought, if you come to buy grain, you have to listen to me." People with this kind of thinking cannot do a good job in grain supply.
    Grain supply departments in various places must strengthen the political and ideological education of cadres, change those so-called systems that are very inconvenient for farmers to buy grain, and educate cadres to establish a service perspective of caring for the masses everywhere. Only in this way can we do a good job in grain supply and better implement the state's policy of planned grain supply.

    供应粮食要便利农民
    瑞林
    最近湖南省有些地方检查粮食供应工作，发现了一些对农民购粮很不方便的事情。这些事情曾经引起农民的不满。农民说：“国家粮食统销政策虽然好，但是我们买一次粮，要跑好多路，要等很长时间，真是太麻烦。”有的说：“我每次去买粮，看到营业员的官僚态度，心里就气愤。”
    这些农民所以不满，主要是因为有些粮食供应部门贪图自己工作的方便，不给农民方便，随便规定了一些不合理的所谓购粮制度。有些地方规定农民不能购跨月的粮，甚至一次只能购十天的粮。有些粮食供应部门在卖粮时增加了许多麻烦的手续，又不允许凭证代购。这样一来，在购粮的时候，农民们都要排成很长的队伍，等了一天半天，还不一定买到粮食。澧县九区孟溪市供应点的门前过去每天都站着一千多人的队伍，每天总有四、五十人买不着粮。常宁县七区曾经死板地规定月末不卖下月的粮。农民们从很远的地方走到供应点，请求通融一下，营业员却说：“这是制度，你们要买粮，明天来买好了。”像这样一类的所谓制度，给农民增加了很多麻烦。
    这种缺乏群众观点的做法，还表现在有些粮食供应部门设立的供应点太少；农民们要跑好几十里路，才能买一次粮。湘西苗族自治州龙山县有一百八十九个乡，但只设立了二十四个固定的供应点，有两个乡的农民到供应点买一次粮，来回竟然要走九十里路。有些地区决定多设立些供应点，并采用“死仓活点”的办法，来便利农民购粮。但是，有些粮食供应部门的干部，不愿多跑路，不积极设立流动的供应点。
    这些事实，说明有些粮食供应部门的干部缺乏为群众服务的精神。有些营业员曾经检查自己的思想，说：“过去我根本不注意什么服务态度，我以为，你来买粮，就得听我的。”有着这种思想的人，是不能做好粮食供应工作的。
    各地粮食供应部门必须加强对干部的政治思想教育，改变那些对农民购粮很不方便的所谓制度，教育干部树立起处处关心群众的服务观点。只有这样，才能做好粮食供应工作，才能很好地贯彻国家粮食计划供应的政策。
