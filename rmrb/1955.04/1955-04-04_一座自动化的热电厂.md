An automated thermal power plant
    The Shijiazhuang Thermal Power Plant will be a highly automated enterprise producing electricity and steam heat. It is designed according to the most advanced Soviet technical standards, and the plant will be equipped with world-class machinery supplied by the Soviet Union. Operations from unloading coal, crushing coal, and distributing coal, all the way to feeding pulverized coal into the furnace and removing ash, will be handled by automated machinery. The newest direct distribution equipment will reduce many complex substation levels for the electricity generated by the generators, directly distributing it to users, saving a lot of substation equipment and power loss. All the machinery and equipment in this plant will be equipped with the latest automatic alarms, regulators, and temperature and pressure measuring devices to ensure safe production. In the event of an accident, these machines and equipment can automatically shut down or automatically switch to backup equipment.
    This newly built thermal power plant will also utilize the large amount of steam heat generated after power generation for industrial production. After the first phase of its construction is completed, the steam heat produced by the thermal power plant will be enough to supply several cotton textile factories with 100,000 spindles and 2,500 looms, thereby reducing the boiler equipment of these factories. In this way, the construction cost of boiler equipment for a new textile factory can be saved by about 1.3 million yuan. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    一座自动化的热电厂
    石家庄热电厂将是一个高度自动化的生产电力和蒸汽热能的企业，它是按照苏联最先进的技术标准设计的，厂房里将安装由苏联供给的世界上第一流的机器设备。从卸煤、碎煤、配煤一直到把煤粉送进炉膛和排灰等工作都将由自动化的机械来担任。最新式的直接配电设备，将使发电机发出来的电流减少许多复杂的变电层次，直接分发给用户，节省很多变电设备和电力损耗。这个厂所有的机器设备上，都将设有最新式的自动警报器、调节器和测温测压等保证安全生产的连锁装置，万一发生事故，这些机器设备都能自动停车或自动换上备用的设备。
    这座新建的热电厂还将利用发电后的大量蒸汽热能，供给工业生产使用。当它的第一期建厂工程完工后，热电厂所生产的蒸汽热能足够供给好几个拥有十万纱锭、两千五百台织布机设备的棉纺织工厂使用，从而减少这些工厂的锅炉设备。这样，新建一座纺织工厂，就可以节省大约一百三十多万元锅炉设备的建设费用。（据新华社讯）
