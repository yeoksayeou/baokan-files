Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 15th. Vishwanath, Chief of the Aircraft and Flight Division of Air India International's Bombay branch, issued a statement in Singapore on the 14th after returning from an investigation of the "Kashmir Princess" plane crash site, sternly denying the lies deliberately spread by the American side to cover up the murder committed by American-Chiang Kai-shek agents, claiming that the plane's engine had problems in Bombay and was unsuitable for flight. Vishwanath said: "I am responsible for dispatching the planes on the Bombay-Hong Kong route and understand all the details. Therefore, I can say definitively that the plane and its engines were completely intact in every aspect when leaving Bombay."

Vishwanath pointed out that the plane had been thoroughly inspected by ground mechanics according to the company's strict standards before taking off from Bombay, and the engine performance was found to be "completely satisfactory" at that time. He said: "Therefore, the plane took off for Hong Kong. I can say definitively that the entire flight was without any problems up to the time of the crash. The cause of the crash is still unknown."

Vishwanath expressed "surprise" at the lies fabricated by the American side, and he accused American news agencies of publishing such news "without mastering the facts," which was "extremely inappropriate."

    印度国际航空公司孟买分公司机航组主任
    断然否认美国方面掩饰特务谋杀的谎言
    新华社新德里十五日电　印度国际航空公司孟买分公司机航组主任维斯瓦纳特十四日从“克什米尔公主号”飞机失事地点勘察回来以后在新加坡发表声明，断然否认美国方面为掩饰美蒋特务谋杀罪行而有意散布的所谓飞机引擎在孟买就有毛病因而不宜于飞行的谎言。维斯瓦纳特说：“我负责派出从孟买到香港的航线上的飞机，并且了解一切详情，因此，我能够断然说，这架飞机和各个引擎在离开孟买时，在任何方面都完好无损。”
    维斯瓦纳特指出，这架飞机在孟买起飞以前曾经根据公司的严格标准由地面机械人员加以彻底检查，当时发现引擎性能“完全令人满意”。他说：“于是，飞机就起飞去香港。我能够断然说，截至失事时为止，航行全程都是没有故障的。失事的原因仍然不明。”
    维斯瓦纳特对美国方面捏造的谎话表示“惊奇”，他指责美国通讯社“没有掌握事实”就发表这种消息，“是极不妥当的”。
