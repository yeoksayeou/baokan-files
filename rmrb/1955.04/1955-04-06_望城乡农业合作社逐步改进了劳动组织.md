From the experience of the Wangxiang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xishui County, Hubei Province, over the past three years since its establishment, continuous improvement of labor organization is necessary to continuously increase production efficiency. However, improving labor organization should be carried out step by step, based on possible conditions and the needs of production development. Each improvement should be convenient and feasible for the members and beneficial to production. Only in this way can the agricultural production cooperative truly demonstrate the benefits of collective production.

This agricultural production cooperative was established in the spring of 1952. At the beginning, the cooperative had only twelve households, twenty-four laborers, and more than seventy mu of land. In terms of the number of households and land area, it was similar to a general mutual aid team. The labor organization at that time was very simple: production was not grouped, land was not divided, work was arranged uniformly, work points were assigned daily, and recorded daily. Major tasks were done collectively, and minor tasks were done separately. For agricultural tasks such as carrying pond mud, transplanting rice seedlings, and harvesting grain, which required a lot of manpower, labor was concentrated. For agricultural tasks such as weeding and hoeing wheat, which did not require concentration, temporary divisions of labor were made. They also appropriately divided labor according to each person's physical strength and production skills. In terms of labor calculation, base points were assessed according to each person's physical strength and production skills. It was originally intended to implement "fixed base points, flexible recording," but the assessment was too troublesome and impractical, so "fixed base points, fixed recording" was used. These methods seemed more appropriate at the time, and the members found them convenient and feasible. In this year, the cooperative's labor efficiency improved, more fertilizer was accumulated, nine damaged ponds were repaired, and drought was resisted. It also managed thirteen lotus ponds. The cooperative achieved unprecedented bumper harvests, with total agricultural income increasing by more than 30% compared to 1951, and sideline income nearly doubling. The income of all twelve cooperative member households increased.

During the cooperative's production activities, the members gradually felt that the "fixed base points, fixed recording" method was unreasonable. Some tasks were done the same by all members, and the labor results were similar. However, people who were assessed nine base points only got nine points for a day's work, while people who were assessed ten base points always got ten points. Therefore, people who were assessed nine base points were very dissatisfied and angrily said, "I'll just do nine points' worth of work!" Their enthusiasm for labor was not high. There was no bonus for people who made special achievements in production, which could not further encourage their production enthusiasm.

After the autumn harvest, the cooperative expanded to twenty-seven households, with fifty-six laborers, and more land was added. Improving production management became an even more prominent issue, as members lived in ten different villages. After discussion, they decided to divide the land into several plots, divide the labor force into several groups, and assign various agricultural tasks to each group, with each group implementing the "fixed base points, flexible recording" method to calculate labor.

When the idea of dividing plots and groups was first being considered, there were many ideological concerns among the members: some were afraid that their group would be assigned poor labor, land, cattle, and farm tools, and that production would not be successful in the future; some had an unclear understanding of grouping and thought that grouping meant separation, that they would no longer interact with each other, and that production difficulties would be difficult to overcome; some members with poor labor power were afraid that after contracting, they would have to "work hard," which they could not handle. Cooperative Director Rao Xingli and others explained these ideas. He explained that dividing groups and plots was for management convenience, to prevent idling, and to further improve production, not separation, and that any problems encountered by any group would still be resolved by the cooperative as a whole. They also educated everyone to think about the cooperative as a whole and about production, and not just about themselves. In this way, the members' ideological concerns were dispelled. Everyone unanimously agreed to divide into three production teams. The method of grouping was: first divide the labor force, then divide the land, and finally divide the cattle and farm tools. The land was allocated according to the base points of the labor force; the cattle and farm tools were allocated according to production needs. The strength of the labor force, the level of production skills, and the quality of cattle and farm tools were carefully matched during grouping to ensure fairness and reasonableness.

After the grouping issue was resolved, the members raised a new issue: "After group production, some groups may have high work point evaluations, some may have low evaluations, some groups may work meticulously, and some groups may work carelessly. What should be done?" Later, after everyone's discussion, it was decided to adopt the method of "contracting work with quality requirements." That is, before each stage of agricultural work arrived, the members would democratically discuss and evaluate each type of work, determine the required quality, and the number of work points required. For example, for transplanting rice seedlings, transplanting "five or eight inches" per mu of land required two work points, so it would be evaluated at twenty points; for ordinary one mu of land from transplanting to harvesting, in normal years, ten and a half work points would be required, so it would be evaluated at one hundred and five points. Land that was difficult to work would be evaluated with more work points. Based on this standard, the work of each group was evaluated and contracted to each group. If the time was extended, the cooperative would not give extra work points; if the quality was poor, they would be criticized, and work points would be deducted. Those who did well would be commended. If the quality standard was met and the actual labor cost was less than the contracted amount, it would still be calculated according to the contracted amount as a reward. For tasks that were not in units and for which the amount of labor could not be predetermined, such as drought resistance, picking beans, and opening threshing grounds, the methods of "fixed base points, flexible recording" and "contracting by the piece" were adopted.

After the implementation of the group contracting method, there was a great improvement in the cooperative's production management. The production team leaders' sense of responsibility was strengthened, and they planned and organized the production of their teams at any time. The members also knew the bottom line, and they could earn more by doing more work, so their enthusiasm for production was also increased. Competition was also carried out among the groups.

In the production activities, some problems were gradually discovered. Due to the inconsistent labor attitudes and farming techniques of the members between this group and that group, the yields varied. When the autumn harvest was distributed, there were disagreements.

In the spring of 1954, the cooperative expanded to sixty-nine households. The original form of labor organization could no longer meet the needs of production. The old members all expressed opinions and wanted to improve the labor organization. According to the members' opinions, the management committee divided the cooperative into five field production teams, one sideline production team, and one vegetable group; and implemented the "contracting work and output system" on a trial basis, stipulating the annual output per mu of land, with rewards for exceeding the output and compensation by each team for failing to reach the stipulated output. Before the implementation of "contracting work and output," some new members said: "Don't work hard, if production increases in the future, it will be divided among sixty-nine households, and we won't get more than others!" After the implementation of "contracting work and output," everyone felt that they could get rewards if they did a good job and had to compensate if they did not do well, so their enthusiasm for production increased. More than 300 loads of mud fertilizer were also picked up in small waterlogged fields that had not been touched for decades; some ran to distant places to get fertilizer.

Later, during the rice transplanting period, the "grasping the three heads" method was created (grasping agricultural work, grasping time, grasping members' self-reported workdays), and contracting work became more detailed. For example, from May 3rd to 13th, during the ten days of the rice transplanting season, it was planned to seize this time to finish transplanting the rice seedlings. At the same time, there were many other tasks, such as building embankments, spreading fertilizer, planting beans, planting sorghum, planting sugarcane, and replanting cotton, which were also planned to ensure that none were missed. Then, it was determined how many work points were needed in total, and the members were asked to report how much they could do in these ten days, how much each team could do, and whether the labor force of the entire cooperative could complete these tasks. If there was not enough labor or if there was a surplus, a solution would be found. By grasping these three heads, everyone from the production team to each member had a clear idea. The cooperative cadres took the initiative in leading production, and the members' idea of "drifting along" was gradually eliminated.

After the implementation of contracting work and output, production improved further. However, there were still some problems in contracting work. At that time, contracting work was not divided into types of work or levels, but was based on the "work" (workdays) required for the job. Doing a heavy job for a day was also ten points, and doing a light job for a day was also ten points. There was no distinction between difficult and easy jobs, or between jobs that required skill and jobs that did not require skill. During the autumn harvest, the cooperative learned from the experience of some agricultural production cooperatives in Northeast China and adopted the "quota piecework" method. This was more detailed than the original contracting method they used. The method was: to pre-evaluate the quota for each type of agricultural work. For example, for harvesting grain, an average laborer could harvest 1.25 mu of land in one day, which would be considered one quota; an average laborer could pick 20 jin of cotton in one day, which would also be considered one quota. Then, according to the difficulty of the work and the level of skill required, the levels of each type of work were evaluated. For example, plowing the fields was very tiring and required skill, so it was considered a first-level job, and completing one quota would earn ten and a half points; picking cotton was relatively easy and did not require much skill, so it was considered a fifth-level job, and completing one quota would earn eight and a half points. Harvesting grain was considered a second-level job, and completing one quota would earn ten points. The members called this method "what kind of person does what kind of work, and what kind of work earns what kind of reward." Doing so greatly increased the members' enthusiasm for labor.

Due to the implementation of the "quota piecework" method, quotas were evaluated for all types of work, and it was possible to divide labor and occupations very meticulously. During the winter sowing period, some people plowed the land, some people harrowed the land, some people dug ditches, and then sowing, fertilizing, watering, and covering the ground followed, with each person managing their own work and cooperating with each other, and production efficiency increased by 20-30%.

Contracting work and output is a complex task that involves many issues and requires all aspects of work to keep up. The Wangxiang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative has not yet achieved this. Accounting work, according to the requirements of contracting work and output, should have clear accounts in terms of production investment and the use of labor; how much investment was made by which team for which crop? How much labor was used? Everything should be calculated and recorded clearly for inspection. However, the cooperative's accounts are still very chaotic, the fertilizer used for cotton and the fertilizer used for rice cannot be distinguished, and how many workdays were actually used for which fields cannot be seen. Therefore, the members have a lot of opinions when distributing income. The members of the teams that reduced production were not convinced and said: The reason why other teams have high yields is because they spent a lot of money. These issues still need to be studied and resolved in detail.

    望城乡农业合作社逐步改进了劳动组织
    熊达
    从湖北省浠水县望城乡农业生产合作社创办三年来的情况来看，劳动组织不断地改进，生产效率才能不断地提高。但是，改进劳动组织要根据可能的条件和生产发展的需要，一步一步地进行。每次改进，都要使社员觉得方便可行，要对生产有利。只有这样，才能使农业生产合作社真正显示出集体生产的好处。
    这个农业生产合作社是在一九五二年春天成立的。刚建社的时候，全社只有十二户，二十四个劳动力，七十多亩田。从户数和田亩看来，同一般的互助组差不多。当时的劳动组织很简单：生产不分组，土地不分片，活路统一安排，每天排工，每天记分。大活伙起来做，小活分开做。像挑塘泥、插秧、割谷等农活，需要人力多，就把劳动力集中起来做，薅田、锄麦等农活，用不着集中，就临时分工做。他们还按每个人的体力的强弱，生产技术的高低，适当地分了工。在劳动计算方面，按各人的体力强弱，生产技术高低，评出底分。本来说是要实行“死分活记”，结果评起来太麻烦，行不通，还是“死分死记”。这些办法在当时看来是比较合适的，社员也觉得方便可行。这一年，社里劳动效率提高了，多积了肥料，修了九口破塘，抗住了旱灾，还经营了十三口藕湖。社里得到了空前的丰收，农业总收入比一九五一年增加了三成多，副业收入差不多要增加两倍。十二户社员，家家都增加了收入。
    在社的生产活动中，社员们渐渐感觉到了“死分死记”的办法不合理。有些活，社员们都是一样做，劳动效果也差不多。但是评九分底分的人劳动一天只得九分，评十分底分的人，老是得十分。因此，评九分底分的人很不满意，气呼呼地说：“我就做九分的活！”劳动积极性不高。对于生产有特殊成绩的人，也没有加分，这就不能进一步鼓舞他们的生产情绪。
    秋收以后，社扩大到了二十七户，有五十六个劳动力，田地也加多了，社员分住在十个湾子里，改进生产管理就更成为一个突出的问题了。他们经过讨论决定把土地划成几片，把劳力划成几组；把各种农活包给各组，各小组再实行“死分活记”的办法，计算劳动。
    在开始酝酿划片分组的时候，社员中有很多思想顾虑：有的生怕本组分到了不好的劳力、土地、耕牛、农具，将来生产搞不好；有的对分组认识不清，认为分组就是分了家，以后彼此不来往，生产有困难不好克服；有些劳动力差的社员怕包工以后，要“硬过硬”，拖不过来。社长饶兴礼等针对这些思想进行了解释。说明分组划片是为了管理方便，防止窝工，进一步搞好生产，不是分家，以后那一组有问题还是要由社里统一解决。并且教育大家要为全社着想，为生产着想；不要光顾自己不顾别人。这样一来，社员的思想顾虑打消了。大家一致赞成分成三个生产组。分组的办法是：先分劳动力，再分田，最后分耕牛、农具。田地根据劳动力的底分分配；耕牛、农具就按照生产的需要来分配。劳动力强弱，生产技术高低，耕牛、农具好坏，在分组时注意搭配，做到公平合理。
    分组问题解决以后，社员又提出个新问题：
  “分组生产以后，有些组的工分评得高，有的评得低，有的组做得细致，有的组做得毛糙，怎样办呢？”后来经过大家讨论，决定采取“包工定质”的办法。就是在每一段农活到来以前，由社员民主评议，把每样活评一下，看那些活要做到什么样的程度，要多少工。比方插秧、插“五、八寸”，一亩田要用两个工，就评二十分；普通一亩田从插秧到秋收，在平常年景，需要十个半工，就评一百零五分。不好做的田，工分就评多些。根据这个标准，把各组的活评出分来，包给各组。拖长了时间，社里不给加工分；质量做得差，要受到批评，还要扣工分。做得好的提出表扬。达到了质量标准而实际费工比包工少的，还是按照包工算报酬，作为奖励。不成件的和不能预定用工多少的活，像抗旱、摘豆、开稻场等，就采用“底分活记”和“按件包干”的办法。
    实行分组包工的办法以后，社里的生产管理有很大的改进。生产组长的责任心加强了，他们随时计划搞好组里的生产。社员也摸到了底，多做活就能多得报酬，生产积极性也提高了。各组之间还开展了竞赛。
    在生产活动中，渐渐地又发现了一些问题。这个组和那个组之间，由于社员的劳动态度和耕作技术不一致，产量有高有低。秋收分配的时候，彼此就闹起意见来。
    一九五四年春天，社又扩大到六十九户。原来的劳动组织形式，更不能适应生产需要了。老社员都提出意见，要改进劳动组织。管理委员会根据社员的意见，把社划成五个田间生产队，一个副业生产队和一个菜蔬组；并且试行“包工包产制”，规定每亩田的常年产量，超过产量的给以奖励，没有达到规定产量的，由各队赔补。在实行“包工包产”以前，有些新社员说：“莫下力做，将来增产了还不是六十九户分，我们又不能比别人多得些！”实行“包工包产”以后，大家觉得活做好了能得奖励，做不好要赔，生产劲头高了。在几十年没有人问过的小水壋里，也挑起了三百多担泥肥；有的跑到很远的地方去搞肥料。
    后来，在插秧期间，又创造了“抓三头”的办法（抓农活，抓时间，抓社员自报劳动日），包工做得更加细致了。例如：从五月三日到十三日十天当中，正是插秧的季节；就计划抓住这段时间把秧插完。在同时，还有很多活路，像搭岸、撒粪、种豆、栽高粱、栽甘蔗、补种棉花等，也把这些农活计划出来，不让一件丢掉。然后看总共需要好多工，再让社员自报自己在这十天当中能做多少，每个队能做多少，看全社的劳动力是不是能做完这些活。如果劳动力不够或者多余，再想办法。把这三头一抓，从生产队到每个社员，心里都有了底。社干部领导生产也主动了，社员“混日子”的思想也逐步消除了。
    实行包工包产以后，生产又提高了一步。但是，在包工当中也还有些问题。当时包工没有分工种，分等级，只是按做活所需要的“工”（工作日）包的。重活做一天也是十分，轻活做一天也是十分。难做的活和容易做的活，需要技术的活和不需要技术的活，也没有区别。秋收时候，社里学习了东北一些农业生产合作社的经验，采用了“定额计件”的办法。这比原来他们采用的包工办法更细致些。这办法是：把每样农活预先评出定额来。比方割谷，一个普通劳动力一天能割一亩二分五厘田，就算一个定额；一个普通劳动力一天能拣二十斤棉花，这也算一个定额。再按活路轻重难易，技术高低，评出每个工种的等级来。像犁田，人很受累，又要讲技术，算一级工，完成一个定额就得十分半；拣棉花比较轻松，又不要多大的技术，算五级工，完成一个定额就得八分半。割谷算二级工，完成一个定额得十分。社员把这种办法叫做“什么样的人做什么样的活，做什么活得什么报酬”。这样做，又大大提高了社员的劳动积极性。
    由于实行了“定额计件”的办法，样样活路都评出了定额，就能够很细致地分工分业。在冬播期间，有的人犁地，有的人耙地，有的人开沟，后面接着下种、上肥、浇水、盖地，各人管各人的活，互相配合，生产效率提高了两三成。
    包工包产是一个复杂的工作，牵涉到的问题很多，要求各方面的工作都能跟上。望城乡农业生产合作社目前还没有做到这一点。会计工作，按照包工包产的要求，在生产投资、使用劳动力等方面，都应该有清楚的账目；哪一队哪一种作物投资多少？用了多少劳动力？都应该计算清楚，记载清楚，以便检查。但是，社里的账目仍很混乱，棉花下的肥料和稻谷下的肥料分不清，那一些田究竟用了多少劳动日也看不出来。因此，在分配收益时，社员很有意见。减产的队的社员不服气地说：别队产量高是因为本钱花得大。这些问题还需要很细致地研究解决。
