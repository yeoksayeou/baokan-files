After attending the Bandung Asian-African Conference, I feel very honored and pleased to have this opportunity to visit the Republic of Indonesia at the invitation of the Prime Minister of Indonesia. On behalf of the Chinese people and the Government of the People's Republic of China, I extend warm and friendly greetings to the Indonesian people and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia.

The Asian-African Conference has established and enhanced understanding among Asian and African countries and affirmed the common aspirations of the Asian and African people to oppose colonialism, uphold world peace, and promote friendly cooperation in political, economic, and cultural fields. The declaration of the Asian-African Conference promoting world peace and cooperation is fully in line with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This declaration has once again pointed out the direction of efforts for friendly relations between Asian and African countries and even all countries and peoples of the world.

The Republic of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China have consistently adhered to the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty and equality and mutual benefit. The friendly relations between our two countries are constantly developing. During the Asian-African Conference, China and Indonesia signed a treaty on the issue of dual nationality, resolving a problem left over from the old era. This has further enhanced the friendly relations between our two countries.

The Chinese people, who are struggling to safeguard their sovereignty and territorial integrity, deeply sympathize with and support the just demand of the Indonesian people to restore sovereignty over West Irian. The Chinese people are willing to work together with the Indonesian people to jointly strive for the great cause of safeguarding their respective national independence and ensuring peace.

I congratulate Indonesia on its national prosperity and strength.

    在参加万隆亚非会议之后，我能有此机会应印度尼西亚总理的邀请访问印度尼西亚共和国，感到非常荣幸和高兴。我代表中国人民和中华人民共和国政府向印度尼西亚人民和印度尼西亚共和国政府致热烈友好的敬意。
    亚非会议建立并增进了亚非各国之间的了解，肯定了亚非人民反对殖民主义、拥护世界和平和促进政治、经济和文化的友好合作的共同愿望。亚非会议促进世界和平和合作的宣言同和平共处的五项原则是完全符合的。这个宣言为亚非两洲乃至世界各国和人民间的友好关系再一次指出了努力的方向。
