Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 6th. The Chinese Trade Delegation to Japan held a press conference at the Imperial Hotel on the evening of the 5th.

    Head of Delegation Lei Renmin answered questions raised by Japanese reporters regarding Sino-Japanese trade issues. He clarified China's basic policy and attitude towards Sino-Japanese trade, which is to seek agreement through sincere consultations based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, and according to the needs and possibilities of both parties. He also stated that Sino-Japanese trade has bright and extremely broad development prospects, and pointed out the fully advantageous conditions for both countries in trade.

    When discussing the key to Sino-Japanese trade, Lei Renmin pointed out that the past Japanese government did not assume its due responsibilities and obligations, which not only prevented Sino-Japanese trade from fully realizing its potential, but also failed to fully utilize the possible conditions that already existed today. The fact that the two previous Sino-Japanese trade agreements were not fully implemented illustrates this problem.

    In response to a reporter's question on how to normalize relations between China and Japan, Lei Renmin said: The Chinese government has repeatedly expressed a clear position and attitude, which is to establish friendly relations with all countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. As long as the Japanese government has the same desire and takes corresponding measures, the Chinese government and people are willing to establish normal relations between the two countries. When a Japanese reporter asked about the mutual establishment of permanent trade offices between China and Japan, Lei Renmin said that he advocates and supports the mutual establishment of trade offices between the two countries, because this is conducive to the development of trade between the two countries. However, this institution must be effective and have the authority to play its role.

    Finally, Lei Renmin also answered many specific questions raised by reporters regarding Sino-Japanese trade.

    Xinhua News Agency, Osaka, April 6th. The Chinese Trade Delegation to Japan, led by Head of Delegation Lei Renmin, arrived in Osaka by plane from Tokyo on the afternoon of the 6th.

    Accompanying the delegation to Osaka were: Shigezo Murata, Chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association; Yoshitaro Hirano, Secretary-General of the Japan Peace Committee; and Kesaichi Ito, Chairman of the Board of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations.

    Those who welcomed the delegation at the airport included: Masao Tajima, Vice Chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association; Koichi Uda, Manager of Yodogawa Steel Works; Yosamatsu Matsubara, Manager of Hitachi Shipbuilding; Den Kawakatsu, Manager of Japan Spinning Manufacturing Company; Yasuji Saito, Manager of Daiichi Chisen Company; Shozo Morii, Manager of Japan Talc Company; Kanji Kawakami, Member of Parliament; Kazutaro Sugano, Professor of Osaka University of Economics; Masato Sugawara, President of the Osaka Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association; and representatives of overseas Chinese.

    The Chinese Trade Delegation will hold discussions and conduct visits with business circles in Osaka, Kobe, Nagoya, and other places in the Kansai region.

    我国贸易代表团在东京举行记者招待会
    雷任民率领代表团到大阪进行参观访问
    新华社东京六日电　中国访问日本贸易代表团五日晚在帝都饭店举行记者招待会。
    雷任民团长对日本记者提出的有关中日贸易问题作了解答。他阐明了中国对中日贸易的基本政策和态度，这就是根据平等互利原则，根据双方的需要和可能，进行诚恳协商求得达成协议。他还说明了中日贸易有着光明的、极为广泛的发展前途，并且指出两国在贸易上的充分有利条件。
    雷任民谈到中日贸易的关键时指出，过去的日本政府不承担应负的责任和义务，因而使中日贸易不仅未能充分发挥它的潜在力，而且对今天已有的可能条件也未充分利用。过去签订的两次中日贸易协议没有完全实现就说明了这一问题。
  雷任民在回答记者关于如何使中日两国关系正常化的问题时说：中国政府已多次表示了明确的主张和态度，这就是根据和平共处的五项原则同一切国家建立友好的关系。只要日本政府具有同一的愿望，并采取相应的措施，中国政府和人民愿同日本建立起两国间的正常关系。当日本记者问到中日两国间互设常驻贸易机构的时候，雷任民说，我是主张并且赞成两国间互设贸易机构的，因为这有利于两国贸易的发展。但这一机构必须是有效的和有权力的，这样才能发挥它的作用。
    最后，雷任民还就记者提出的许多有关中日贸易的具体问题作了答复。
    新华社大阪六日电　中国访问日本贸易代表团在雷任民团长率领下，六日下午从东京乘飞机到达大阪。
    陪同代表团到大阪的有：日本国际贸易促进协会会长村田省藏，日本拥护和平委员会总书记平野义太郎，恢复日中、日苏邦交国民会议理事长伊藤今朝市等人。
