    On the Celebration of the Tenth Anniversary of the Soviet Army's Liberation of Hungary
    Comrade Deng Zihui's Speech
    Dear Comrades and Friends:
    Today is the glorious festival of the tenth anniversary of the liberation of Hungary. The Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China feels very honored and pleased to be here with the Hungarian people to celebrate this grand, joyous festival for the whole nation. Entrusted by the Chinese people, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and Chairman Mao Zedong, we bring to all the Hungarian people the warm, fraternal congratulations of your sincere friends – the six hundred million Chinese people.
    The powerful and invincible Soviet army liberated Hungary from the Nazi German aggressors in the great war against Hitlerite fascism, and since then the Hungarian people have been forever freed from the painful situation of being oppressed and exploited, and have gained true freedom and independence. We Chinese people can deeply appreciate the great significance of this glorious day of April 4th for the development of the destiny of the Hungarian people. The Hungarian people waged a long, unyielding, heroic, and tenacious struggle for the independence and freedom of their motherland, and finally won victory with the help of the Soviet Union. As the Hungarian people celebrate the tenth anniversary of their liberation, we Chinese people feel infinite joy and encouragement.
    In the short span of ten years, the Hungarian people, under the correct leadership of the Hungarian government and the Hungarian Working People's Party, have achieved tremendous successes in building a free and happy new life, thus fundamentally changing the face of the old Hungary. The Hungary of the reactionary ruling years was shrouded in the shadows of unemployment, hunger, and poverty, and the enslavement by foreign aggressors further restrained the vitality of the Hungarian national development. Today, the Hungarian people are living a vibrant new life that is completely different from the past. They firmly control their own destiny and are happily engaged in socialist construction on the land of their beautiful motherland. Hungary's socialist industry, especially heavy industry, which is the foundation of the national economy, has achieved rapid development. The socialist component in agriculture is growing rapidly. The working class and the working peasants have formed a solid alliance.
    The united party of the Hungarian working class—the Hungarian Working People's Party—under the banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, has united the entire people and is guiding the country towards a glorious road that its predecessors have never taken—the road of socialist construction. The Hungarian Working People's Party has consistently followed the principles of socialist construction, firmly implemented the policy of national socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of agriculture, and waged an irreconcilable struggle against any anti-Marxist-Leninist ideological tendencies that distort the party's policies. In order to develop the national economy in a balanced way and continuously improve the people's living standards, the Hungarian Working People's Party made historically significant resolutions at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee in June 1953 and at the Third Congress of the Party. The correct resolutions of the recent plenary session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party are of even greater importance for implementing the Party's unwavering Marxist-Leninist line. We are fully confident that the tested Hungarian Working People's Party, with the enthusiastic support of all the Hungarian working people headed by the working class, will surely overcome all difficulties and push the arduous cause of socialist construction to new victories.
    The Hungarian people are hardworking and brave. The brilliant achievements they have made since liberation are a vivid example of the great vitality of the people's democratic system. These achievements have made valuable contributions to strengthening the power of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The Chinese people often regard the brilliant achievements of the Hungarian people as their own and feel delighted and encouraged.
    The Hungarian people are not isolated in their struggle to build a new life. They have always received great selfless assistance from the Soviet people and have established close cooperative relations with the people of fraternal countries. The Chinese people have always shown deep concern and support for the Hungarian people who are advancing victoriously on the socialist road. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people has greatly developed over the past five years. Our two countries have established extensive fraternal cooperation, especially through the signing and implementation of agreements on trade, culture, science and technology, broadcasting, and postal and telecommunications cooperation, which have made this cooperation even closer. Hungary's advanced construction experience and excellent cultural achievements are worthy of our learning, and the construction achievements of New China in various fields have also aroused widespread sympathy and enthusiastic support from the Hungarian people. Last year, the Government Delegation of the Hungarian People's Republic headed by Comrade Hegedüs participated in our country's fifth anniversary of National Day, and now our Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China is participating in the celebration of the tenth anniversary of Hungary's liberation, fully expressing the deep fraternal feelings and friendship between our two peoples. We firmly believe that this new type of friendly and cooperative relationship between our two countries in the entire peace, democracy, and socialist camp will become more consolidated and developed year by year. The Government and people of the Hungarian People's Republic have consistently made active efforts to consolidate peace, ease international tensions, and develop friendly cooperation between countries. Based on their own historical experience and the lofty aspiration to build a socialist motherland, the Hungarian people have unswervingly fought together with the fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world against the revival of German militarism and against the Paris Agreement. The Chinese people are not only concerned about peace in Asia, but also about peace in Europe and the world. The Chinese people are determined to fully support the just struggle of the people of all countries to safeguard peace in Europe and defend the security and independence of their motherlands. We have firm confidence that with the solid unity of the powerful peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and with the unswerving struggle of the peace-loving people all over the world, all imperialist aggression plans and war conspiracies must be completely shattered. The cause of justice must be victorious. Dear comrades and friends: Today, as we celebrate this great and glorious festival of the Hungarian people, please allow me, in the name of the Chinese people and the Government of the People's Republic of China, to wish the Hungarian people new and greater victories under the leadership of the Hungarian Government and the Hungarian Working People's Party, in laying the foundation of socialism, implementing socialist industrialization, and completing the great national construction tasks aimed at promoting the prosperity and happiness of the people, as well as in the struggle to defend European and world peace. Long live the glorious Hungarian People's Republic! Long live the unbreakable, fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people! Long live the great world peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    在苏军解放匈牙利十周年庆祝大会上
    邓子恢同志的讲话亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    今天是匈牙利解放十周年的光荣节日。中华人民共和国政府代表团在这里同匈牙利人民一道共同欢庆这个隆重的、全民欢腾的节日，感到非常荣幸和高兴。我们受中国人民、中华人民共和国政府和毛泽东主席的委托，带来了你们真诚的朋友——六亿中国人民对全体匈牙利人民热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    强大无敌的苏联军队在反希特勒法西斯的伟大战争中把匈牙利从纳粹德国侵略者的手中解放出来，从此匈牙利人民永远摆脱了受压迫、受剥削的惨痛境地，获得了真正的自由和独立。我们中国人民是能够亲切地体会到四月四日这个光荣的日子对于匈牙利人民命运的发展具有何等重要的意义的。匈牙利人民为了祖国的独立和自由，进行过长期不屈不挠的英勇的顽强的斗争，在苏联的帮助下，终于赢得了胜利。当匈牙利人民庆祝解放十周年之际，我们中国人民感到无限的欢欣和鼓舞。
    在短短的十年中，匈牙利人民在匈牙利政府和劳动人民党的正确领导下，在建设自由幸福的新生活中获得了巨大的成就，从而根本地改变了旧日的匈牙利的面貌。过去反动统治年代的匈牙利笼罩着失业、饥饿和贫困的阴影，外国侵略者的奴役更束缚了匈牙利民族发展的生命力。今天匈牙利人民过着与以前截然相反的生气勃勃的新生活，他们牢牢地掌握着自己的命运，在自己美丽的祖国的土地上愉快地进行着社会主义的建设。匈牙利社会主义的工业，尤其是作为国民经济基础的重工业获得了迅速的发展。农业中的社会主义成分正迅速地增长。工人阶级和劳动农民已结成了牢固的联盟。
    匈牙利工人阶级的统一的政党——劳动人民党在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的旗帜下，团结了全体人民，正引导这个国家走向他们前人所从来没有走过的光辉的道路——社会主义建设的道路。匈牙利劳动人民党一贯地遵循着社会主义建设的原则，坚定地实行国家社会主义工业化和农业社会主义改造的政策，并同任何歪曲党的政策的反马克思列宁主义的思想倾向进行不调和的斗争。匈牙利劳动人民党为均衡地发展国民经济和不断提高人民生活水平，在一九五三年六月党的中央全会上和党的第三次代表大会上作出了具有历史意义的决议。最近匈牙利劳动人民党中央全会的正确决议对贯彻党的坚定不移的马克思列宁主义路线更加具有非常重要的意义。我们充分地相信：久经考验的匈牙利劳动人民党在以工人阶级为首的全体匈牙利劳动人民热情的支持下，必定能够战胜一切困难，把艰巨的社会主义建设事业推向新的胜利。
    匈牙利人民是勤劳的勇敢的，他们在解放以来所获得的光辉成就，是人民民主制度具有伟大生命力的鲜明例证。这些成就为加强以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营的力量作出了宝贵的贡献。中国人民经常把匈牙利人民的辉煌成就看作自己的成就一样而感到欢欣鼓舞。
    匈牙利人民在建设新生活的斗争中并不是孤立的，他们一直获得苏联人民伟大的无私的援助，并同各兄弟国家人民建立了亲密的合作关系。中国人民对在社会主义道路上胜利前进的匈牙利人民始终寄予深切的关怀和支持。自从中华人民共和国诞生以后，五年来，中匈两国人民的友谊获得了很大的发展。我们两国已建立起广泛的兄弟般的合作，特别是通过贸易、文化、科学和技术、广播、邮电合作等协定的签订和执行，已使这种合作更加密切。匈牙利先进的建设经验和优秀的文化成果值得我们学习，而新中国各方面的建设成就也引起了匈牙利人民广泛的同情和热诚的支持。去年以赫格居斯同志为首的匈牙利人民共和国政府代表团参加我国五周年国庆和现在我们中华人民共和国政府代表团参加庆祝匈牙利解放十周年，充分地表达了我们两国人民相互间的深厚的兄弟感情和友谊。我们深信：我们两国在整个和平、民主、社会主义阵营中的这种新型的友好合作关系一定会一年比一年更加巩固和发展。匈牙利人民共和国政府和人民一贯地为巩固和平、和缓国际紧张局势、发展各国间的友好合作而积极努力。匈牙利人民从自身的历史经验和建设社会主义的祖国的崇高愿望出发，坚持不渝地同以苏联为首的各兄弟国家和爱好和平的全世界人民一起，为反对复活德国军国主义、反对巴黎协定而进行了不懈的斗争。中国人民不仅关心亚洲和平，同样也关心欧洲和全世界的和平，中国人民决以全力支持各国人民为保障欧洲和平、保卫自己祖国的安全和独立的正义斗争。我们怀着坚定的信心：有着以苏联为首的强大的和平、民主、社会主义阵营的巩固团结，有着全世界爱好和平的人民坚持不渝的斗争，一切帝国主义的侵略计划和战争阴谋一定要被彻底粉碎。正义的事业一定要得到胜利。亲爱的同志们，朋友们：今天，当我们庆祝匈牙利人民这个伟大的光荣的节日的时候，请让我以中国人民和中华人民共和国政府的名义，祝匈牙利人民在匈牙利政府和劳动人民党的领导下，在奠定社会主义基础、实行社会主义工业化和完成旨在促进人民繁荣幸福的伟大的国家建设任务中，以及保卫欧洲和世界和平的斗争中获得新的更大的胜利。光荣的匈牙利人民共和国万岁！中匈两国人民牢不可破的、兄弟般的友谊万岁！以苏联为首的伟大的世界和平、民主、社会主义阵营万岁！　　（新华社布达佩斯五日讯）
