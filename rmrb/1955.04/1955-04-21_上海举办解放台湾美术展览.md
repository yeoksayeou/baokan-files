The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Artists Association began preparations more than two months ago for the "Oppose the U.S.-Chiang Treaty, We Must Liberate Taiwan" fine arts exhibition. It was held at the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Hall from April 1st to 17th. Over the course of seventeen days, a total of more than 100,000 people visited the exhibition.

The 164 works on display were created by 94 artists from Shanghai and East China, all under the same theme of "Oppose the U.S.-Chiang Treaty, We Must Liberate Taiwan." The works vividly pointed out that Taiwan has always been an inseparable and sacred part of our country's territory, exposed the aggressive essence of the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," the various conspiracies of U.S. imperialism to invade our country by using the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and the internal contradictions among the invaders. They depicted the suffering of Taiwanese compatriots under the brutal rule of the U.S. and Chiang, and their desire for liberation. They expressed the Chinese people's determination and firm will to liberate Taiwan, oppose aggression, defend the motherland, and defend world peace. The audience said, "Seeing this exhibition is like attending a profound political lesson." On stacks of feedback forms, they also wrote: We must support the struggle to liberate Taiwan with practical actions.

This type of fine arts exhibition, combined with the current major political struggle, conducts vivid and popular propaganda and education for the masses, which can achieve a more concentrated, vivid, and profound effect than general fine arts exhibitions. At the same time, it is also a good opportunity for painters to learn and practice using art to serve the current major political struggle under the same theme.

Due to audience demand, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Artists Association will select some of the exhibited works to compile into an album, which will be published by the Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House.

    上海举办解放台湾美术展览
    中国美术家协会上海分会，两个多月前就开始筹备的“反对美蒋条约、一定要解放台湾”美术展览会，从四月一日到十七日在上海中苏友谊馆展出，十七天中总计约有十多万人参观了这个展览会。
    展览会展出的一百六十四件作品，是上海和华东各地九十四位画家在“反对美蒋条约、一定要解放台湾”这同一主题下创作出来的。作品形象地指出了台湾从来便是我国神圣不可分割的领土，揭露了美蒋“共同防御条约”的侵略实质、美国帝国主义利用蒋介石卖国集团侵略我国的种种阴谋和侵略者内部的矛盾，描绘了台湾同胞在美蒋残酷统治下的苦难生活和渴望解放的要求，表现了中国人民一定要解放台湾、反对侵略、保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的决心和坚强的意志。观众们说：“看了这个展览会，胜如上了一堂深刻的政治课”。一叠一叠的意见书上，他们还写着：要以实际行动支援解放台湾的斗争。
    这种美术展览，结合当前重大的政治斗争，对群众进行形象的、通俗的宣传教育，较之一般的美术展览可以获得更为集中、更为生动和深刻的效果。同时，对于画家们在同一主题下，用艺术为当前重大的政治斗争服务，也是一种很好的学习和锻炼。
    由于观众的要求，中国美术家协会上海分会将要从展出作品中选出一部分，编成画册，由上海人民美术出版社出版。
