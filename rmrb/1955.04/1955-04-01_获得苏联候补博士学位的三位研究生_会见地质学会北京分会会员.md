    Three graduate students, Tu Guangchi, Zhang Zonghu, and Zhang Zhongyin, who were among the first in our country to receive the Candidate of Geological and Mineralogical Sciences degrees in the Soviet Union, met with members of the Beijing Branch of the Geological Society of China on March 27th. Zhang Zonghu and Zhang Zhongyin were invited to give two academic reports related to engineering geology, which aroused widespread interest among the scientists present.

    Tu Guangchi, Zhang Zonghu, and Zhang Zhongyin completed their degree theses in less than three and a half years at the Geology Department of Moscow State University, the Moscow Ordzhonikidze Geological Prospecting Institute, and the Leningrad Mining Institute, respectively. Their three theses, "The Structure and Genesis of Pyrite Deposits in Two Mining Areas of the Ural Mountains," "A Study on Engineering Geology in the Construction of Irrigation Canals in Loess Regions," and "The Genesis of the Upper Permian Variegated Strata and Their Engineering Geological Properties in the Area of the Votkinsk Hydroelectric Power Station," were all highly praised by Soviet scientists for their unique insights. These issues are of great significance for the study of stratigraphy, engineering geology, and mineral deposit exploration in our country.

    获得苏联候补博士学位的三位研究生
    会见地质学会北京分会会员
    我国在苏联第一批获得地质矿物科学候补博士学位的涂光炽、张宗祜、张忠胤等三位研究生，三月二十七日和中国地质学会北京分会的会员们会见了。张宗祜、张忠胤被邀请作了两个有关工程地质的学术报告，引起了到会科学家们广泛的兴趣。
    涂光炽、张宗祜、张忠胤分别在国立莫斯科大学地质系，莫斯科奥尔忠尼启则地质勘测学院、列宁格勒矿冶学院以不到三年半的时间，完成了自己的学位论文。他们的“乌拉尔山某两个矿区黄铁矿床的构造及成因”“黄土区域建筑灌溉渠时工程地质的研究”“沃特金斯克水电站地区的上二叠纪杂色地层的成因及其工程地质的性质”等三篇论文，都因有独特的见解而获得了苏联科学家们的高度评价。这些问题对于研究我国的地层学、工程地质和矿床的勘探等都有重要的意义。　（新华社）
