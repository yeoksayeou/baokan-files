    Xinhua News Agency, April 9th - According to TASS, Paris: On the evening of April 6th, a mass rally marking the unity of the working people of France and Germany was held at the Winter Velodrome in Paris. Thousands of residents of Paris and its suburbs who participated in the rally expressed their readiness to fight alongside the German people against the common enemy - German militarism.
    The rally was presided over by Maurice Thorez, an old leader of the French Communist Party. He stated that although the ratification of the Paris Agreements had brought many difficulties, the united efforts of the German and French people would surely lead to the victory of the cause of peace.
    Next, Willi Mohn, Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, took the stage and pointed out that the Paris Agreements harbored the seeds of a new war. But the people of France and Germany want neither division nor war, therefore the people will never recognize the Paris military agreements.
    Mohn also emphasized that an increasingly broad mass of the German people are demanding the abolition of the Paris Agreements, which hinder the peaceful reunification of Germany. He called on everyone to continue to intensify the struggle against the implementation of the Paris Agreements, and pointed out that there is currently the necessary strength to carry out this struggle, because the fate of Germany, France and other European countries is in the hands of the people of these countries.
    Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, spoke at the meeting. He emphasized that the Paris Agreements mean the collusion of the French bourgeoisie with German militarists who are trying to launch a war of revenge against the Soviet Union under the leadership of American imperialists. In the face of this situation, the working people of France should strengthen their solidarity with their German brothers. He said: German militarism, which could revive fascism, must never be allowed to revive. Duclos called on everyone to fight for peace. His speech aroused a storm of applause from the audience.

    Xinhua News Agency, April 10th - According to TASS, Warsaw, April 9th: Representatives of the peace committees of some European and Asian countries participating in the Third Polish National Peace Congress, together with Polish peace supporters, issued a statement. Representatives of the peace committees of Austria, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Japan, the German Democratic Republic, West Germany, Romania, Sweden and Poland signed the statement.
    The statement said: We, the representatives of the peace movements of different European and Asian countries, together with the Polish peace supporters, are deeply convinced that the establishment of a collective security system aimed at achieving peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems on the basis of mutual respect for the sovereignty of all countries, can consolidate peace and security in Europe. The obstacle to achieving this goal is the policy of reviving German militarism pursued by American militarists wielding atomic weapons. The statement said that therefore, the primary task of peace-loving people of all countries is to further intensify the struggle against the implementation of the Paris Agreements and to strive for the destruction of the currently stockpiled thermonuclear weapons under international supervision.

    法德两国人民反对实施巴黎协定
    参加波兰和平大会的各国代表号召巩固欧洲和平
    新华社九日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：四月六日晚，在巴黎冬季赛车场举行了一个标志着法、德两国劳动人民团结一致的群众大会。参加大会的巴黎及其城郊的数千居民表示：他们准备同德国人民一道，为反对共同敌人——德国军国主义而斗争。
    大会由年老的法国共产党领袖加香主持。他表示：尽管巴黎协定的批准带来了很多困难，但是德、法两国人民的团结努力一定会使和平事业取得胜利。
    接着，德国共产党中央委员会书记处书记维利·蒙恩走上讲台，他指出：巴黎协定蕴藏着新战争的萌芽。但是法、德两国人民既不愿意有分歧，也不要战争，因此人民绝不承认巴黎军事协定。
    蒙恩还着重指出：越来越广泛的德国人民群众要求废除阻碍德国和平统一的巴黎协定。他号召大家继续加紧为反对实现巴黎协定而斗争，并且指出目前有进行这种斗争的必要力量，因为德国、法国和欧洲其他国家的命运掌握在这些国家的人民手里。
    法国共产党中央委员会书记雅克·杜克洛在会上讲话。他着重指出：巴黎协定意味着法国资产阶级同竭力要在美帝国主义者领导下对苏联发动复仇战争的德国军国主义者的勾结。法国劳动人民在这种情况面前，应当加强同他们的德国兄弟的团结。他说：绝不容许可能使法西斯主义复活的德国军国主义复活。杜克洛号召大家为争取和平而斗争。他的谈话引起全场暴风雨般的掌声。
    新华社十日讯　据塔斯社华沙九日讯：参加波兰第三届全国和平大会的一些欧洲和亚洲国家和平委员会的代表，同波兰的和平拥护者一起发表了一项声明。在这个声明上签名的有奥地利、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、丹麦、芬兰、法国、日本、德意志民主共和国、西德、罗马尼亚、瑞典和波兰的和平委员会的代表。
    声明说：我们欧洲和亚洲不同国家的和平运动的代表，同波兰的和平拥护者一起，深信建立目的在于使不同社会制度的国家在互相尊重一切国家主权的基础上实行和平共处的集体安全体系，能够巩固欧洲的和平和安全。妨碍达到这个目的的障碍是挥舞着原子武器的美国军国主义分子所奉行的恢复德国军国主义的政策。声明说，因此，各国爱好和平的人民的首要任务是进一步加紧进行反对巴黎协定的实施、争取在国际监督下销毁目前储存的热核子武器的斗争。
