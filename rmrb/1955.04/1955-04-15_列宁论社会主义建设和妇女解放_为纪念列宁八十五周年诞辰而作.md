Lenin on Socialist Construction and Women's Liberation
——Written in Commemoration of the Eighty-fifth Anniversary of Lenin's Birth
Cai Chang

The great and immortal Lenin sincerely loved the working people, deeply cared for working women, and brilliantly guided and enthusiastically supported their struggle. He creatively developed the theories of Marx and Engels on the struggle for the liberation of working women, and pointed out the path for the complete liberation of working women all over the world.

Our women's liberation cause was founded on the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution and the brilliant example of the complete liberation of Soviet women, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and together with the people of the whole country, after a long revolutionary struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. We have achieved the great victory of the people's democratic revolution and realized the first step of women's liberation. Now, we are concentrating all our efforts on building a prosperous and happy socialist country and gradually realizing the complete liberation of women. To better study and understand Lenin's theories on socialist construction and women's liberation is the fundamental guarantee for leading this struggle to victory.

(I) The victory of socialist construction is possible only by mobilizing millions of women to participate.

Lenin pointed out that mobilizing the masses of women is an important condition for implementing and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and implementing and consolidating socialist construction.
“Unless millions of women are with us, we cannot exercise the proletarian dictatorship, we cannot engage in construction according to communist principles.” (See Zetkin: "Reminiscences of Lenin") In our country, to complete socialist construction, that is, to eliminate the private ownership of the means of production and class exploitation, and to transform China from a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist industrial country, cannot but be an arduous and complex task. Without relying on the unity and selfless labor of the country's men and women citizens, the completion of this task is impossible.

Looking at the socialist construction and socialist transformation currently underway in our country, almost every specific measure is widely and closely related to the masses of women. According to statistics from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, there are more than 1.3 million female workers in factories, mines, and enterprises across the country. The women in the families of even more workers have a close relationship with the workers. Their level of consciousness and housework management have an important impact on the labor enthusiasm and production efficiency of the workers. In terms of agricultural production, it is estimated that female labor accounts for about 30 percent of the organized agricultural labor force. In some agricultural production cooperatives, female members account for about half of the total number of members. Many women participate in labor in handicrafts that manufacture means of livelihood, such as cotton weaving, knitting, wool weaving, and the garment industry. Most of the handicrafts for export, such as beautiful embroidery, brocade, carpets, drawnwork, straw braids, and lace, are produced by women. Women participate in education, medical services, hygiene, cooperatives, and state organs. Therefore, whether they are women in employment or in school, whether they are urban or rural housewives, they are participating in the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation in one way or another. Working women are the majority of women, and in recent years they have made outstanding contributions to the construction of the motherland, and a large number of excellent model figures have emerged. Facts in various places have fully proved that any region or department that can specifically and deeply carry out socialist education and organizational work among women, focusing on their thoughts and demands, cultivate their ability to participate in social labor and social activities, and help them overcome difficulties can fully mobilize them and become an important force in promoting socialist construction and socialist transformation. On the other hand, any region or department that does not pay attention to working among women cannot universally mobilize the masses of women and will hinder the work. Lenin warned in 1920: "If they (referring to women - author) are not with us, the counter-revolutionary forces may lead them to oppose us." (Ibid.) Our country now has individual places where some women are being used by counter-revolutionary elements because of neglecting women's work. Therefore, we must remember Lenin's teachings and always pay attention to educating the masses of women and winning them over, no matter how much difficulty we encounter when doing so. Only in this way can our socialist construction and socialist transformation succeed and be consolidated. The idea of ​​disliking women as troublesome and backward, underestimating women's strength, and neglecting women's work is contrary to Leninist principles. This kind of thinking and action is not only not conducive to the cause of women's liberation, but also weakens the strength of building a socialist country.

(II) Only socialism can guarantee the complete liberation of women.

Lenin taught us to attach great importance to and fully utilize the strength of the masses of working women, and enthusiastically support the struggle for the liberation of working women as part of the proletarian revolutionary cause. He said: "The proletariat cannot gain complete freedom unless it achieves complete freedom for women." (Lenin: "To Working Women")
"We hold the ideal of socialism, we are to strive for the complete realization of socialism, and here a very large workplace is opened up for women." (Lenin: "The Tasks of the Women Workers' Movement in the Soviet Republic") It is very clear that only the victory of socialist construction and socialist transformation, the elimination of the private ownership of the means of production and the system of man exploiting man, can finally eliminate the fundamental conditions that make women unequal; only the victory of socialist construction can gradually reduce women's housework and create more favorable conditions for women to participate in national management, economic, cultural and other construction undertakings. From socialism to communism, on the basis of the complete public ownership of the means of production in industry and agriculture, and the higher development of social production and culture, women, like all members of society, will have the opportunity for all-round development. At that time, labor will become a pleasant thing, and all members of society—both men and women—will live a happy life of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs."

However, the victory of socialism and communism, and the happy life of complete equality between men and women, must rely on the labor and struggle of women themselves to truly achieve. Lenin said: "The liberation of the workers should be carried out by the workers themselves. Similarly, we should say that the liberation of the women workers should also be carried out by the women workers themselves." "For women to achieve complete liberation and real equality with men, what is needed is socio-economic, and the participation of women in general productive labor, at which time women will stand on the same footing as men." (Ibid.) Our Party Central Committee follows Lenin's brilliant thought and guides the women's liberation movement in our country, taking the mobilization of women to participate in social production as the guideline for realizing women's liberation and carrying out women's work after the victory of the people's democratic revolution. For many years, we have implemented this guideline, and therefore, under the guarantee of the people's democratic system, with the increasing growth of socialist economic factors, the number of women participating in production has increased year by year, and women's contribution to social production has expanded year by year. The feudal and capitalist ideas of male superiority and female inferiority that bind women have been severely hit, and the welfare undertakings for women and children are gradually developing on the basis of production development. This has achieved significant results in promoting equality between men and women. Now, many women have realized from their own experience that "only socialism can liberate women." "Only labor can achieve equality, and only struggle can achieve freedom." However, feudal and capitalist ideas have a great influence among some women, and the idea and action of belittling labor can be found everywhere. Therefore, we must repeatedly, patiently, and deeply and specifically educate women to love socialism and love labor, to realize that the victorious progress of the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation is the highest interest of all men and women citizens, and to realize that the interests of the individual must be subordinated to the interests of the country. In the process of the development of socialist construction and socialist transformation, we must gradually strive for more and more women to participate in social production, and strive to realize their own complete liberation through their own labor and struggle.

At present, because our country's socialist construction is still in its initial stage, it is impossible to immediately absorb all women into social production in a short period of time. Therefore, in order to correctly implement the policy of mobilizing women to participate in social production, we must follow the development of social production, and gradually progress according to the country's various production plans and labor force allocation plans, and prevent subjective blind mobilization. At the same time, in order to implement this policy, we must also give full play to the strength of women from all aspects and increase women's contribution to production. Confining ourselves to any one method will limit the comprehensive implementation of this policy, and we will not be able to fully utilize the potential of women under the existing conditions.

(III) In the new socialist family, engaging in housework is of great social significance and is therefore respected; gradually reducing women's housework is also necessary and possible.

Lenin further taught us: to realize the true liberation of women, we must "liberate them from 'domestic slavery'" (Lenin: "International Working Women's Day"), because "as long as women are engaged in housework, their position will always be oppressed" (Lenin: "The Tasks of the Women Workers' Movement in the Soviet Republic"). We have deeply learned from actual life that the old family built on the private ownership of the means of production is ruled by patriarchy. In this kind of family, women's labor of giving birth to and raising children is to give birth to descendants and expand private property for the male head of the family. Therefore, in this kind of family, men and women are unequal, women are slaves, and have no rights or status. We must guide women to transform this kind of family, and gradually "universally transform trivial housework into socialist large-scale economy" (Lenin's words), which is an unswerving truth.

In order to correctly and deeply understand Lenin's instructions, we must further analyze the nature and role of the family and housework. The family is not immutable, it changes with the development of the social and economic system, and it is affected by certain political, legal, and moral viewpoints. The new family in Soviet socialist society is an important unit of society. This kind of family is built on the basis of the socialist economy, and it is established under the conditions of the victory of socialist construction, the participation of the broad masses of women in socialist production, and the large-scale establishment of public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and so on by the state. The characteristic of this new family is the complete equality between men and women, monogamy, and the right for men and women to participate in social labor and equal pay for equal work. The main role of this new family is to jointly be responsible with state children's organs and schools for educating children to become active builders of socialism and communism. Therefore, the mother's education of children to become new people who faithfully serve socialism and communism, and the housewife's burden of daily life labor to serve family members engaged in social labor, are all conscious, are all contributions to socialist and communist construction, and are creating a happy life for themselves and their families, and are therefore respected by society. At the same time, in the Soviet Union, many housewives and mothers actively participate in social activities and serve the public.

In our country, since liberation, a large number of new families with equality between men and women, democracy and harmony, and unity and production have emerged in both urban and rural areas. Doing a good job in the relationship of this kind of family and handling the affairs of this kind of family well is very important for promoting the production enthusiasm of family members. From our work with family members of employees, we can see that: implementing the policy of serving factory and mine production, widely carrying out political and cultural education for the women of employees' families, encouraging them to develop neighborhood unity and mutual assistance, family harmony, doing a good job in housework, taking good care of children, and doing a good job in diet, so as to reduce the family burden of employees, improve employees' health, encourage employees' attendance, and improve employees' production enthusiasm, is of great significance for developing factory and mine production. At the same time, it also creates a happy and beautiful family, improves women's socialist consciousness, and encourages and creates conditions for women to participate in social activities. Therefore, it greatly improves their status in society and in the family.

However, at present, in the vast majority of families in our country, housework is mainly or completely borne by women, which is still the division of labor left over from the old society and the old family, which more or less hinders women from engaging in social production and social activities. Our country is still in a period of transition. Although socialist economic factors are growing day by day, there are still diverse economic components. From these complex economic components, the old, feudal ideas of male superiority and female inferiority and the bourgeois ideas of playing with and discriminating against women will still have a wide range of influence. Therefore, in our country, we must strive to improve people's socialist moral character on the basis of the development of socialist production, resolutely fight against feudal and capitalist ideas, educate everyone to treat the family with socialist ideological principles, transform the old ideas and old traditions left over from the old society, and establish a new family with equality between men and women, democracy and harmony, unity and production, and where husbands, wives, and all members jointly bear housework. At the same time, we can, according to the needs and possibilities of national construction in the current period, educate women to appropriately arrange housework and social production and social activities, and, where possible, gradually organize public undertakings to help women reduce housework (such as childcare organizations), in order to increase women's possibility of participating in social production and social activities. However, if, under the current conditions in our country, we are eager to socialize housework and attempt to completely push the education of children to the state, that is neither appropriate nor possible. It is inappropriate to mobilize women with heavy housework to participate in excessively heavy social labor and social activities, so as to hinder the normal life of the whole family and their own health, without considering the current housework burden of women; similarly, it is also wrong not to consider how to gradually reduce women's housework and increase women's possibility of participating in social undertakings at all.

(IV) For the benefit of socialist construction and socialist transformation, we should oppose corruption, depravity, lawlessness, and discipline violations in marriage and sexual life.

With the victorious development of socialist construction and socialist transformation, the socialist ideological consciousness and socialist moral character of the people of our country are improving, a new socialist relationship between people is being established, new socialist marriages and new families have grown up in large numbers, and have become a positive factor in promoting the smooth development of socialist construction and socialist transformation in our country. However, capitalist ideas are corroding the working people and revolutionary cadres from all aspects, and some people are developing extremely serious bourgeois individualism, pursuing a bourgeois licentious and decadent lifestyle, playing with and trampling on women, and corruption, depravity, lawlessness, and discipline violations occur in sexual life and marriage relations. This cannot be allowed. The phenomenon of corruption, depravity, lawlessness, and discipline violations in people's sexual life and marriage issues is not only a matter of the man or woman being deceived and played with, not only a matter of personal private life, but also a major social and political issue of bourgeois ideas corroding the revolutionary camp and harming the concentration and growth of revolutionary forces. Therefore, we must seriously treat this issue and resolutely fight against corrupt and decadent bourgeois ideas and behaviors. Taking a tolerant, shielding, or vulgar liberal attitude towards this kind of thinking and behavior harms the interests of the revolution. As early as thirty-five years ago, Lenin clearly foresaw that "in construction, the issue of sexual relations, the issue of marriage and the family, will become popular issues. At the same time, if necessary, you must engage in struggle at any time and in any place. You must try to prevent these issues from being handled by non-Marxist methods, and do not let these issues become the basis for overstepping and conspiracy." (Zetkin: "Reminiscences of Lenin") We should remember Lenin's proverbs, resolutely fight against the corrupt and decadent ideas and behaviors that violate the law and discipline in sexual life and marriage issues that harm the revolutionary forces; strive to cultivate communist moral qualities in love and marriage life; advocate that both men and women, on the basis of complete equality and joint participation in socialist and communist labor, and after a considerable period of deep understanding, achieve sincere and lasting love due to the consistency of political and ideological views and a high sense of responsibility for their lover and future children. Only marriage and family relationships built on the basis of this sincere and lasting love can help the socialist revolutionary cause. The great Lenin and Krupskaya, in their common revolutionary cause, in the lively entire revolutionary life, have always respected each other, loved each other, helped each other, struggled together, and contributed all their energy to the revolution, and created a noble revolutionary family, which has become the best model for us to learn from.

Leninism contains the entire and complete theory of the struggle for the liberation of the broad masses of working women. This theory, like Lenin's theory on other issues, embodies the high principled nature of Marxist revolutionary theory and contains the valuable experience of revolutionary struggle and the women's liberation movement. This theory, like Lenin's theory on other issues, is a universal truth that applies everywhere, and is the revolutionary theory that guides the struggle for the liberation of working women all over the world. This great theory has been fully realized in the Soviet Union, and Soviet women have set an unprecedented brilliant example of the liberation struggle for working women all over the world. This great theory guides the masses of working women in the people's democratic countries of Europe and Asia to continuously advance victoriously in their own liberation cause. This great theory is also encouraging working women in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries to fight for the defense of women's rights.

The great Leninism shines brightly on the road to the complete liberation of working women all over the world, and the great and immortal Lenin will always live in the hearts of working women all over the world.

    列宁论社会主义建设和妇女解放
    ——为纪念列宁八十五周年诞辰而作
    蔡畅
    伟大的不朽的列宁，真挚地热爱劳动人民，亲切地关怀劳动妇女，英明地指导和热情地支持着她们的斗争，创造性地发挥了马克思恩格斯关于劳动妇女解放斗争的学说，指引了全世界劳动妇女彻底解放的道路。
    我国妇女解放事业，就是在伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利和苏联妇女获得彻底解放的光辉榜样鼓舞之下，在中国共产党的正确领导之下，和全国人民一起，经过反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的长期革命斗争而奠定了基础的。我们已经取得了人民民主革命的伟大胜利，实现了妇女解放的第一步。现在我们又正在集中全力为建设繁荣幸福的社会主义国家，为逐步实现妇女的彻底解放而斗争。更好地学习和领会列宁关于社会主义建设和关于妇女解放的学说，是领导这个斗争达到胜利的根本保证。
    （一）只有发动千百万妇女群众参加，社会主义建设事业的胜利才是可能的。
    列宁指出，发动妇女群众是实行和巩固无产阶级专政，实行和巩固社会主义建设的重要条件，
  “除非有千千万万的妇女跟我们在一起，我们就无法实行无产阶级专政，无法按共产主义的方针从事建设。”（见蔡特金：“列宁印象记”）在我国，完成社会主义建设，也就是说，消灭生产资料私有制和阶级剥削，把中国由落后的农业国变为先进的社会主义工业国，这不能不是一件艰巨而复杂的任务。如果不依靠全国男女公民的团结一致和忘我的劳动精神，这个任务的完成是不可能的。
    就我国正在进行的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业来看，几乎每一项具体措施都和妇女群众有着广泛而密切的联系。据中华全国总工会统计，在全国厂、矿企业中劳动的女职工达一百三十余万人。比这为数更多的职工家庭中的妇女们，她们和职工有着血肉相联的密切关系，她们的觉悟程度和家务管理工作，对于职工的劳动积极性和生产效能有着重要的影响。在农业生产方面，据估计，已经组织起来的农业劳动力中，女劳动力约占百分之三十，有些农业生产合作社中，女社员约占社员总数的一半左右。在制造生活资料的手工业，如棉织、针织、毛织、服装业中有很多妇女参加劳动。外销的手工业品，如美丽的刺绣、织锦缎、地毯、挑补花、草帽辫、花边等，大部分是妇女生产的。教育、医务、卫生、合作社和国家机关中，都有妇女参加。所以不论在职在校的妇女，不论城乡的家庭妇女，正在这样或那样地参加着社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业。劳动妇女是妇女中的多数，几年来她们对祖国建设已经有了卓越的贡献，并涌现了大批优秀的模范人物。各地的事实已经充分证明，哪一个地区、哪一个部门能针对妇女的思想和要求，在她们中间具体深入地进行社会主义教育工作和组织工作，培养她们参加社会劳动和社会活动的能力，帮助她们克服困难，她们就能充分地发动起来，成为推进社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的重要力量。反之，哪一个地区、哪一个部门不注意在妇女中进行工作，就不能普遍地发动妇女群众，就会使工作受到阻碍。列宁在一九二○年警告说：“假如她们（指妇女—笔者）不和我们在一起，反革命势力或许就会领导她们来反对我们。”
  （同前）我国现在就有个别地方因为轻忽妇女工作，而使有些妇女被反革命分子所利用。因此，我们必须记住列宁的教导，经常注意教育妇女群众，争取她们，不管我们这样做的时候会遭遇到多大的困难。只有这样，我们的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业才能胜利和巩固。那种嫌妇女麻烦落后，低估妇女力量，轻忽妇女工作的思想，是违反列宁主义原则的。这种思想和行动不仅不利于妇女解放事业，而且会削弱建设社会主义国家的力量。
    （二）只有社会主义才能保证妇女的彻底解放。
    列宁教导我们要十分重视和充分运用劳动妇女群众的力量，热情地支持劳动妇女解放斗争，把它作为无产阶级革命事业的一部分。他说：“无产阶级，如果不取得妇女们之完全的自由，那他就不能获得完全的自由。”（列宁：“给劳动妇女们”）
  “我们抱着社会主义的理想，我们是要为完全实现社会主义而奋斗，这里对于妇女便开辟了一个很大的工作场所。”（列宁：“苏维埃共和国女工运动的任务”）事实很明白，只有社会主义建设和社会主义改造的胜利，生产资料的私有制和人剥削人的制度的消灭，才能最后消除使妇女处于不平等地位的根本条件；只有社会主义建设的胜利，才能逐步减轻妇女的家务劳动，为妇女参加国家管理工作、经济、文化及其他各种建设事业创造更优越的条件。由社会主义发展到共产主义，在工业和农业的生产资料完全成为全民所有制，在社会生产和文化更高度发展的基础上，妇女将和社会一切成员一样，获得全面发展的机会，那时劳动变成了愉快的事情，社会的一切成员——男的和女的都过着“各尽所能，各取所需”的美满的幸福的生活。
    但是社会主义和共产主义的胜利，男女完全平等的美满幸福生活，必须依靠妇女们自身的劳动和斗争，才能真正达到。列宁说：“工人底解放应当由工人自己来进行的。同样，我们应当说，女工底解放也应当由女工自己来进行的。”“要使妇女达到完全的解放和与男性底真正平等，则需要社会经济，需要妇女参加一般的生产劳动，那个时候妇女将会站到同男性同样的地位。”（同前）我们的党中央遵循着列宁的英明思想，指导我国的妇女解放运动，把发动妇女参加社会生产，作为人民民主革命取得胜利后，实现妇女解放和进行妇女工作的方针。多年来我们执行了这个方针，因而在人民民主制度的保障下，随着社会主义经济因素的日益成长，妇女参加生产的人数一年比一年增加，妇女在社会生产中的贡献一年比一年扩大，束缚妇女的封建的和资本主义的男尊女卑的思想传统受到了沉重的打击，妇女儿童的福利事业正在生产发展的基础上逐步开展。这在促进男女平等方面收到了重大的成绩。现在许多妇女已经从亲身的经历中认识到
  “只有社会主义才能解放妇女。”“只有劳动才能平等，斗争才有自由。”但是在某些妇女中封建思想和资本主义思想都有很大的影响，轻视劳动的思想和行动到处可以发现。因此我们还必须反复耐心而又深入具体地教育妇女热爱社会主义，热爱劳动，认识国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的胜利进行就是全体男女公民的最高利益，认识个人的利益要服从国家的利益。我们要在社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的发展过程中，逐渐争取愈来愈多的妇女参加社会生产，争取用自己的劳动和斗争来实现自身的彻底解放。
  目前由于我国社会主义建设尚在开端，不可能在短时期内立即吸收所有的妇女参加社会生产。因此为了正确地贯彻发动妇女参加社会生产的方针，就必须循着社会生产的发展，按照国家的各项生产计划和劳动力的调配计划，逐步渐进，防止主观的盲目的动员。同时，为了贯彻这项方针，也必须从各个方面来发挥妇女的力量，增进妇女对生产的贡献。拘守任何一种方法，就要限制这项方针的全面贯彻，就不能在现有条件下充分发挥妇女的潜力。
      （三）在社会主义的新家庭中，从事家务劳动是有重大的社会意义的，因而是受人尊敬的；逐步减轻妇女的家务劳动也是必要的、可能的。
    列宁又更进一步教导我们：要实现妇女的真正解放，必须“把她们从‘家庭奴隶制’之下解放出来”（列宁：“国际劳动妇女节”），因为“在妇女从事于家务之下，她们的地位始终是受压迫的”（列宁：“苏维埃共和国女工运动的任务”）。我们从实际生活中深刻地领会到，建筑在生产资料私有制上面的旧家庭，是被夫权主义所统治的。在这种家庭里，妇女生男育女的劳动，是为男子家长生育承继和扩大私有财产的后代。因此，在这种家庭里，男女是不平等的，妇女是奴隶，毫无权利和地位。我们必须引导妇女改造这种家庭，逐步“把烦琐家务普遍改造为社会主义大经济”（列宁语），这是一定不移的道理。
    为了正确地深刻地领会列宁的指示，还必须进一步分析家庭和家务的性质和作用。家庭不是一成不变的，是随着社会经济制度的发展而变化的，是受着一定的政治、法律和道德观点的影响而变化的。苏联社会主义社会里的新家庭，是社会的一个重要单位，这种家庭是建筑在社会主义经济基础上的，是在社会主义建设胜利，广大妇女已经参加了社会主义生产，国家大量设立了公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等条件下建立起来的。这种新家庭的特点，是男女完全平等的一夫一妻制，是男女共同享有参加社会劳动，同工同酬的权利。这种新家庭的主要作用，是和国家儿童机关及学校共同负责，教养子女成为社会主义、共产主义的积极建设者。因此，母亲教养子女成为忠诚服务于社会主义、共产主义的新人，主妇担负日常生活的劳动，为从事社会劳动的家庭成员服务，都是自觉的，都是对社会主义、共产主义建设有贡献的，都是为自己和家属创造幸福的生活，因而也是受到社会的尊敬的。同时在苏联，许多家庭主妇们、母亲们，又积极地参加了社会活动，为公众服务。
    在我国，解放以来，不论城市和乡村，都涌现了大批男女平等、民主和睦、团结生产的新家庭。搞好这种家庭的关系，处理好这种家庭的事务，对于促进家庭成员的生产积极性，是很重要的。从我们在职工家属的工作中可以看到：贯彻为厂矿生产服务的方针，对职工家庭的妇女广泛地进行政治和文化教育，鼓励她们开展邻里团结互助，家庭和睦，搞好家务，带好孩子，做好饮食，以减少职工家务牵累，增进职工健康，鼓励职工出勤，提高职工的生产积极性，对于发展厂矿生产有很大的意义。同时也就缔造了幸福美满的家庭，提高了妇女的社会主义觉悟，鼓励了并创造了妇女参加社会活动的条件。因而又大大提高了她们在社会上和家庭里的地位。
    但是，现在我国绝大部分家庭中，家务主要或完全由妇女来负担，依旧是旧社会旧家庭遗留下来的分工办法，对妇女从事社会生产、社会活动或多或少是有妨碍的。我国现在还处在过渡时期，社会主义经济因素虽然正在日益增长，但依旧存在着多种经济成分，从这种复杂经济成分上，旧的、封建的男尊女卑的思想和资产阶级玩弄和歧视妇女的思想还会有广泛影响的。因此，在我们的国家里，必须努力在社会主义生产发展的基础上，努力提高人们的社会主义道德品质，坚决同封建的和资本主义的思想进行斗争，教育大家用社会主义思想原则来对待家庭，改造旧社会遗留下来的旧思想和旧传统，建立男女平等、民主和睦、团结生产的、由丈夫、妻子和所有成员共同负担家务劳动的新家庭。同时，我们可以根据国家在目前时期建设的需要和可能，教育妇女适当地安排家务劳动和社会生产、社会活动，并在可能条件下，逐步举办帮助妇女减轻家务的公共事业（如托儿组织等），以增进妇女参加社会生产、社会活动的可能。但是如果在我国现在的条件下，急求家务劳动社会化，企图把孩子的教养完全推给国家，那是既不应该也不可能的。不考虑目前妇女的家务负担，动员家务繁重的妇女参加过重的社会劳动和社会活动，以致妨碍全家正常生活和本人健康，是不合适的；同样，完全不考虑如何逐步减轻妇女的家务劳动，增进妇女参加社会事业的可能，也是不对的。
      （四）为了社会主义建设和社会主义改造的利益，应该反对婚姻和性生活上的腐化堕落违法乱纪现象。
    随着社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的胜利发展，我国人民的社会主义思想觉悟和社会主义道德品质正在提高，人和人之间的社会主义新关系正在建立，社会主义的新婚姻和新家庭已经大批地生长起来，并成为促进我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利开展的积极因素。但是资本主义思想从各个方面腐蚀劳动人民和革命干部，有的人滋长着极端严重的资产阶级个人主义，追求资产阶级淫荡糜烂的生活方式，玩弄和蹂躏女性，在性生活和婚姻关系上发生腐化堕落、违法乱纪现象，这是决不能允许的。人们在性生活和婚姻问题上发生腐化堕落违法乱纪的现象，不仅是男方或女方被欺骗玩弄的问题，不仅是个人的私生活问题，而是资产阶级思想腐蚀革命阵营，损害革命力量的集中和增长的重大的社会问题和政治问题。因此我们必须严肃地对待这个问题，坚决同腐化堕落的资产阶级思想和行为作斗争。对这种思想和行为采取迁就、包庇或庸俗的自由主义态度，是危害革命利益的。早在三十五年之前，列宁就清楚地预见到“在建设当中，性关系的问题、婚姻和家庭的问题，将成为流行的问题。同时，如果必要的话，你必须随时随地从事斗争。你必须设法使这些问题不致被非马克思主义的方法处理，不要让这些问题成为越轨和阴谋的根据。”（蔡特金：“列宁印象记”）我们应该记着列宁的箴言，坚决地同损害革命力量的、在性生活和婚姻问题上腐化堕落违法乱纪的思想行为作斗争；努力地培植在爱情和婚姻生活中的共产主义道德品质；提倡男女双方在完全平等，共同参加社会主义、共产主义劳动的基础上，经过相当长时期的深刻的了解，由于政治、思想观点一致，由于对爱人及将来的孩子的高度的责任感，达成的真挚的持久的爱情。只有建筑在这种真挚持久的爱情基础上的婚姻和家庭关系，才能有助于社会主义革命事业。伟大的列宁和克鲁普斯卡娅，他们在共同革命事业中，在生气勃勃的全部革命生活中，始终是互相尊敬、互相爱慕、互相帮助、共同奋斗，把自己全部精力贡献给革命，并创造了高尚的革命家庭，成为我们学习的最好的典范。
                    ×××
    列宁主义，包含着广大劳动妇女解放斗争的全部的完整的学说。这种学说和列宁对其他问题的学说一样，体现了马克思主义革命理论的高度的原则性，蕴藏着革命斗争和劳动妇女解放运动的宝贵的经验。这种学说，和列宁对其他问题的学说一样，是放之四海而皆准的真理，是指导全世界劳动妇女解放斗争的革命理论。这个伟大的学说在苏联已经充分实现，苏联妇女为全世界劳动妇女做出了解放斗争的史无前例的光辉榜样。这个伟大的学说指导着欧洲、亚洲的各人民民主国家的劳动妇女群众，在自己的解放事业中不断地胜利前进。这个伟大的学说，也正鼓舞着资本主义国家、殖民地、附属国家劳动妇女为保卫妇女权利的斗争。
    伟大的列宁主义，光芒万丈地照亮了全世界劳动妇女彻底解放的道路，伟大的不朽的列宁，永远活在全世界劳动妇女的心坎中。
