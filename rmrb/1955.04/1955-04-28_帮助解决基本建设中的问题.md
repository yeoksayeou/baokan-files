In the Xi'an area, the preparation work for basic construction in the first quarter of this year was not done well. Many construction sites failed to start on schedule, and some had to suspend work after starting. To address this, the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized an inspection team in late March to inspect various construction sites and found that the designs generally could not keep up with the construction requirements. At the same time, the cooperation between the client and contractor on most construction sites was not close, and many specific problems could not be resolved. In addition, some construction sites rushed to start work without adequate preparation, which affected the normal progress of construction after it began. After these problems were identified, the relevant departments, with the assistance of the municipal party committee's inspection team, dealt with them separately.

    帮助解决基本建设中的问题
      西安地区的基本建设工作，今年第一季度的施工准备工作做得不好，不少工地没能按期开工，部分工地开工后又只得停工。为此中共西安市委在三月下旬，组织了检查组到各工地进行检查，发现各工地普遍存在着设计赶不上施工要求等问题。同时，多数工地甲乙双方配合协作不密切，许多具体问题得不到解决。还有一些工地没有做好准备工作就急于开工，结果影响了开工后不能正常进行施工。这些问题检查出来后，各有关部门在市委检查组协助下，分别作了处理。
