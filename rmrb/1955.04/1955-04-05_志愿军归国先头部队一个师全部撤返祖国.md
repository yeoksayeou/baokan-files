When the trains carrying the returning Chinese People's Volunteers passed through stations such as Sukchon, Jeongju, and Sinuiju, the sides of each train carriage were adorned with bright bouquets by the farewell-giving Korean people. Many Korean children gave their red scarves to the soldiers of the returning Chinese People's Volunteers, and Korean girls also competed to pin corsages on the chests of the CPV soldiers. When the train passed through the Anju Plain, the people who were building the South Pyongan Province irrigation project, the members of the collective production teams engaged in spring plowing, and the tractor drivers all temporarily stopped their work and waved goodbye to the soldiers of the returning Chinese People's Volunteers.

    目前，志愿军归国部队后续部队乘坐的列车已开始继续通过新义州口岸撤返祖国。
    新华社平壤四日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社新义州讯：中国人民志愿军归国部队连日继续乘火车经新义州回国。
