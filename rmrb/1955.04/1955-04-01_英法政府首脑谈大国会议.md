    Xinhua News Agency, London, March 30th, TASS dispatch: According to Reuters, British Prime Minister Churchill said in the House of Commons on the 29th that the prospects for a Four Power conference have recently undergone a "favorable turn." He said: "I have never abandoned my view that a high-level meeting without an agenda could be a beneficial way to seek a solution to international problems."
    Churchill said that if the initiative came from the highest level, there might be a better chance of success. However, so far, the heads of governments have not reached a consensus on this approach. Churchill added: "We are not ruling out any means that could achieve the results we all hope for."
    A question raised by a Labour Party member recalled rumors about Churchill's impending retirement. He asked whether the Prime Minister intended to strive to convene the Four Power conference in time to personally attend it.
    Churchill replied amidst laughter in the chamber: "The future is shrouded in a fog, and I am unwilling to make too many guesses about the future today."
    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 30th, TASS dispatch: On March 30th, French Prime Minister Edgar Faure held a press conference, where he discussed some issues related to France's domestic and foreign policies. He said that Paris, London, and Washington are currently consulting on the issue of a Big Four conference.
    Faure advocated for a swift convening of the Big Four conference, but he said that this should not affect "the effect of the conference."
    Reporters asked Faure to explain his remarks in the Senate of the Republic regarding the recognition of the People's Republic of China. He replied that he was not referring to immediate recognition, but rather that "Atlantic nations" should "consult" on this issue.
    Faure then said that the Austrian issue could be a topic for Big Four negotiations.

    英法政府首脑谈大国会议
    新华社三十一日讯　塔斯社伦敦三十日讯：据路透社消息，英国首相邱吉尔二十九日在下院说，四大国会议的前途最近有了“有利的转变”。他说：“我从来没有放弃过我的看法：一个没有议程的高级会谈可能是谋取国际问题的解决的有益的方式。”
    邱吉尔说，假如倡议是来自最高级的话，那就可能有获得成功的较好的机会。然而迄今各国政府的首脑对这种办法的看法仍然没有取得一致。邱吉尔补充说：“我们是不排斥可以实现我们大家所希望的结果的任何手段的。”
    一个工党议员提出的问题令人想起关于邱吉尔即将退休的传闻。他问道，首相是否打算力求使四大国会议及时地召开，以便能够亲自参加这次会议。
    邱吉尔在会场的一片笑声中回答说：“未来的事情是蒙在一片迷雾之中的，我今天不愿对未来作过多的猜测。”
    新华社三十一日讯　塔斯社巴黎讯：三月三十日，法国总理富尔举行记者招待会，他在会上谈到法国对内和对外政策上的一些问题。他说，现在巴黎、伦敦和华盛顿之间正就大国会谈问题进行磋商。
    富尔主张迅速召开大国会议，但是他说，这不应该影响“会议的效果”。
    记者要求富尔解释他在共和国参议院就承认中华人民共和国问题发表的谈话。他回答说，他并不是指立即承认，而是说“大西洋国家”应当就这一问题“进行磋商”。
    富尔接着说，奥地利问题可以作为大国谈判的题目。
