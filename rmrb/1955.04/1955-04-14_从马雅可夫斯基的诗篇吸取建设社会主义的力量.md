    Drawing Strength for Socialist Construction from Mayakovsky's Poems
    Yu Zhen

    Today (April 14th) is the 25th anniversary of the death of Mayakovsky, the founder of socialist realism poetry. Stalin called Mayakovsky "the best and most talented poet of our Soviet era" because his works reflected the entire great era of socialist revolution and the construction of a communist society.

    Mayakovsky is not just a poet of one nation, Russia, or one country, the Soviet Union, but a poet of all nations and countries in the world; Mayakovsky is not just a poet of the October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet Civil War, the period of national economic recovery, or any other period, but a poet of the entire "our Soviet era." Therefore, all major events in the era the poet experienced are the subjects and themes of his creation. The socialist revolution, the Soviet motherland, socialist today, communist tomorrow, the "attacking class," the Bolshevik Party, the great leaders Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people "writing a greatest epic" - these are all his "favorite themes."

    In Mayakovsky's creation, the people, revolution, the Party, leaders, labor, struggle, ... all these are integrated into a whole, integrated into "our Soviet era," and he is the singer of all the thoughts and emotions of the people of this era.

    The poet sang the "March to Communism" with poems like "hammers" and "bayonets." Every article, every section, every sentence, every line of poetry is filled with his own thoughts and emotions, as well as the thoughts and emotions of the advanced people of the entire era, because the poet himself is a small part of the "era" as a whole. He said:

      I am very happy --
                  this is
                      my labor
   joining
    my republic's
                    labor.
                              (“Good!”)

    I am happy,
                because I am
                      a small part of
                            this power.
                            (“Lenin”)

    The theme of patriotism occupies a central place in Mayakovsky's creation. He sings praises of the Soviet motherland, the lighthouse of all progressive humanity. The poet's inseparable connection with the life of the people, the people's labor, and the people's struggle, fills his patriotism with profound popular character. Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, the Soviet people are carrying out revolutionary construction of world historical significance. Therefore, the Soviet Republic is infinitely precious in the poet's eyes. Recognizing himself as one of the people building a socialist country fills Mayakovsky's creation with the feeling of Soviet pride.

    Motherland and revolution are integrated into an inseparable whole in Mayakovsky's creation. The characteristics of his poetry reflect the characteristics of Soviet patriotism. Soviet people believe that their duty to their motherland is to dedicate all their strength to their motherland. Mayakovsky's creation shows that Mayakovsky is not only a singer of the socialist motherland, but also a defender of the socialist motherland. Mayakovsky lived for the motherland and worked for the motherland. He used all kinds of artistic weapons for the motherland - from posters to narrative poems and dramas.

    Russia before the October Revolution - was a land "beaten full of whip marks." The poet said: "Wherever there is pain, I go there." He keenly felt the pain of his motherland, called on the people to fight against the landlords and bourgeoisie, and he himself selflessly participated in this struggle to liberate this land of "hard labor camps and mines."

    During the October Revolution, Mayakovsky saw the beginning of a new era in the history of the motherland. His love for the "revived Russia" is powerfully expressed in his creation. He said:

    That land
      with the air of
                        sweet juice,
    You can pick it up casually,
                throw it away casually, --
    But
    the land
          that froze together with it,
    I can never
        not love it.
                        (“Good!”)

    The poet's love for the motherland is inseparable from his hatred for the enemy. He expressed his utmost hatred for the British and American imperialists in his poems. Why do they want to try every means to attack socialist countries? The poet said:

    The things
      that open their
                      bloody mouths
                      know,
    if
    a claw gets
            stuck in Russia,
    then
    the entire bourgeois bird -
                      will be helpless.
                        (“Good!”)

    The poet also exposed the essence of the bourgeoisie's so-called "patriotism." They believe that "wife, house, deposit book - this is the motherland, the garden of heaven." Completely different from this "patriotism" of the bourgeoisie is the selfless patriotism of the Soviet people in defending their motherland.

    The theme of patriotism is expressed even more clearly in Mayakovsky's poems and essays about foreign countries. After seeing the irrational system of capitalist countries with his own eyes, he felt the loveliness of the Soviet motherland even more. He proudly said to those American bourgeois who only knew how to exploit surplus value: "The most important thing for us is - our Soviet country, Soviet will, Soviet flag, Soviet sun." He felt that he was an envoy of the new socialist world. He said:

    Look,
      envy,
                  I --
                        am a
    citizen
    of the Soviet Union.
                      (“Poem about Soviet Passport”)

    In Mayakovsky's patriotic poems, there is not only the past and present of the motherland, but also often the "third reality" - the future of the motherland. He said that he "triply praised the future of the motherland." When the poet sang praises of the people's heroic struggle during the Civil War, and the selfless labor during the period of economic recovery and the Stalin Five-Year Plan, he clearly saw the prospect of the development of the Soviet motherland - Communism. Today is for tomorrow, and tomorrow is built on the foundation of today. "We are working as if we are writing a greatest epic." Mayakovsky's poems are filled with love for the socialist motherland and confidence in the victory of Communism. He enthusiastically sings praises of the creative labor of the people in cities and villages.

    The achievements of socialist construction made Mayakovsky plan to write a long poem about the Stalin Five-Year Plan. However, the poet only wrote the prologue "At the Top of My Voice" to the long poem before he passed away. In the prologue of this unfinished long poem, the poet said:

      Let the socialism
                      built
                              in battle
      become our
                common monument.

    The greatest poet of "our Soviet era" did not "fall from the sky," but grew up from the land of Russia. Just as the entire Soviet literature inherits and develops the excellent traditions of Russian literature, Mayakovsky also inherited and developed the excellent traditions of Russian poetry expressed in the creations of Pushkin, Lermontov, and Nekrasov. Mayakovsky inherited the views of his predecessors on the noble mission of the poet.

    Pushkin and Lermontov called the poet a "prophet," and Nekrasov said that the poet must first be a "citizen." Mayakovsky inherited and developed their traditions, calling the poet a "leader of the people and a servant of the people at the same time." He loved Russian classical writers, learned from them, and gave them high praise. In a speech, he especially talked about his love for the genius of Russian literature - Pushkin. He said: "A month ago, while working, Brik recited 'Eugene Onegin,' which I could also recite by heart. I couldn't leave after listening to it, and listened to the whole thing. Afterwards, for two or three days, I walked around moved by the following four lines of poetry:

    I know that my days are limited;
    But in order to prolong my life,
    I must believe in the morning,
    That I met you during the day. Of course, we will re-read such works hundreds of times, even when death puts a noose around our necks, we will still read; we will study this most sincere method of creation thousands of times. This method can give infinite satisfaction and the most accurate expression to the thoughts that must be written, must be written, and are felt by the heart."

    In 1924, when the Soviet Union celebrated the 125th anniversary of Pushkin's birth, Mayakovsky wrote the famous poem "Anniversary." He said: "I love you, but alive, not as a mummy." At the same time, Nekrasov was also mentioned in "Anniversary," which was by no means accidental. Mayakovsky thus pointed out the tradition of Russian classical poetry, and he is indeed a worthy successor to this excellent tradition.

    Mayakovsky inherited and developed the tradition of Russian poetry, and at the same time appeared as an outstanding innovator of poetic form.

    Mayakovsky opposed aestheticism and formalism in poetry. He believed that the most important thing in a work is its content. But at the same time, he also paid great attention to artistic form.

    Mayakovsky's contribution to poetry innovation should first of all be mentioned is writing poetry in the people's spoken language. He rightly believed that the people are "creators of language." In fact, the living spoken language is the foundation of his works.

    At the same time, he also opposed the incomprehensible and rigid words in language. In the same article, he also said: "In all newspapers, it is still common to see sentences that no one understands and do not know what they are saying, such as: 'runs through with a red line,' 'reached the peak,' 'reached the highest peak,' 'suffered defeat,' and so on, and so on."

    The application of the living spoken language also determined the characteristics of the rhythm of Mayakovsky's poems. For many years, the "syllable-stress" method of writing poetry has been used in Russian poetry. Mayakovsky expanded the principles of this method: often shifting from one meter to another, some lines of poetry are very long, and some lines of poetry are very short. In this way, it is possible to better express the diversity of the subject matter. In order to strengthen certain parts of the lines, he often divided a line of poetry into a "staircase shape."

    Mayakovsky also said in "How to Make Verses": "Without rhyme (to understand rhyme broadly), lines of poetry are loose. Rhyme can bring you back to the previous line, remind you of it, and unite the lines of poetry that tell an idea into one." Mayakovsky's rhymes are diverse and expressive. He also wrote: "I often put the most important word at the end of a line, and try everything possible to make it rhyme." This means that Mayakovsky often rhymes the words that express the basic idea of the work.

    This is the new thing that Mayakovsky brought to Russian and world poetry. It is precisely these new forms that can well express the new ideological content of Soviet patriotism in the Soviet era.

    For the Chinese people and Chinese youth who are fighting for the great socialist cause of the motherland today, Mayakovsky's poetry is a loud horn that encourages us to advance; for Chinese writers, artists, and poets who are striving for socialist realism literature and art, Mayakovsky is our great example and mentor. Let us draw "creative and inspiring power" from this giant!

    从马雅可夫斯基的诗篇吸取建设社会主义的力量
    余振
    今天（四月十四日）是社会主义现实主义诗歌的创始者马雅可夫斯基逝世二十五周年纪念日。斯大林把马雅可夫斯基叫做“我们苏维埃时代最优秀最有才华的诗人”，因为他的作品反映了社会主义革命和建设共产主义社会的整个伟大时代。
    马雅可夫斯基不只是俄罗斯一个民族、苏联一个国家的诗人，而是全世界各个民族、各个国家的诗人；马雅可夫斯基不只是十月社会主义革命时期、苏联国内战争时期、国民经济恢复时期、或者其他任何一个时期的诗人，而是整个“我们苏维埃时代”的诗人。因此，在诗人所经历的时代中的一切重大事件都是他创作中的题材和主题。社会主义革命、苏维埃祖国、社会主义的今天、共产主义的明天、“进攻的阶级”、布尔什维克党、伟大的领袖列宁和斯大林、“在写着一篇最伟大的史诗”的苏维埃人——这都是他“最喜爱的主题”。
    在马雅可夫斯基的创作中，人民、革命、党、领袖、劳动、战斗、……这一切都融汇成了一个整体，融汇成“我们苏维埃时代”，他就是这一时代的人们所有一切思想和情感的歌唱者。
    诗人用“铁锤”和“刺刀”般的诗句唱出了“走向共产主义的进行曲”。他的每一篇、每一节、每一句、每一行诗都饱含着他自己的，也是整个时代的先进人们的思想和情感，因为诗人自己就是“时代”这个整体中的一小部分。他说：
      我很高兴——
                  这是
                      我的劳动
   加入
    我的共和国的
                    劳动。
                              （“好！”）
    我是幸福的，
                因为我是
                      这力量的一小部分，
                            （“列宁”）
    爱国主义的主题在马雅可夫斯基的创作中占有中心的地位。他歌颂整个进步人类的灯塔的苏维埃祖国。诗人同人民的生活、人民的劳动和战斗的不可分割的联系，使他的爱国主义充满了深刻的人民性。苏维埃人民在布尔什维克党的领导下，进行着具有世界历史意义的革命建设。因此，苏维埃共和国在诗人看来是无限宝贵的。认识自己也是建设社会主义国家的人民中之一员，使马雅可夫斯基的创作充满了苏维埃人的骄傲的情感。
    祖国和革命，在马雅可夫斯基的创作中，融汇成一个不可分的整体。他的诗歌的特点反映了苏维埃人的爱国主义的特点，苏维埃人认为自己对祖国的职责就是把自己的一切力量献给自己的祖国。马雅可夫斯基的创作中说明了，马雅可夫斯基不只是一个社会主义祖国的歌唱者，而且也是一个社会主义祖国的捍卫者。马雅可夫斯基为了祖国而生活，为了祖国而工作。他为了祖国拿出了各式各样的艺术武器——从宣传画一直到叙事诗和戏剧。
    十月革命前的俄罗斯——是“被打得满身都是鞭痕”的国土。诗人说：“哪里有痛苦，我便走向哪里”，他敏锐地感觉到自己祖国的痛苦，号召人民同地主资产阶级斗争，而且他自己也忘我地参加了这种斗争，解放这“苦役所和矿洞”的国土。
    在十月革命时马雅可夫斯基看见了祖国历史上新时代的开始。在他的创作中显明有力地表现出对“复活过来的俄罗斯”的热爱。他说：
    那有着
      甜果汁似的空气的
                        土地，
    你可以随手拈来、
                随手抛去，——
    但是
    同它
          一道受过冻的土地，
    我是永远
        不能不爱它。
                        （“好！”）
    诗人对祖国的热爱同对敌人的憎恨是分不开的。他在诗中表示出对英美帝国主义者的万分憎恨。他们为什么要想尽方法来进攻社会主义国家呢？诗人说：
    张开了
      血盆大嘴的东西们
                      知道，
    如果
    在俄罗斯
            陷住了一只爪，
    那么
    整个资产阶级的小鸟——
                      就毫无办法了。
                        （“好！”）诗人又揭穿了资产阶级的所谓“爱国主义”的本质，他们认为“妻子、住宅、存款折——这才是祖国、天国的花园”。和资产阶级的这种“爱国主义”完全不同的是苏维埃人忘我地保卫自己祖国的爱国主义。
    爱国主义这一主题，在马雅可夫斯基关于外国的诗篇和随笔中，表现得更为分明。他亲眼看到资本主义国家的不合理的制度之后，越发感觉到苏维埃祖国的可爱。他对那些只知道剥削剩余价值的美国资产阶级高傲地说道：“我们最主要的是——我们苏维埃国家，苏维埃的意志、苏维埃的旗帜、苏维埃的太阳。”他感觉到自己是新的社会主义世界的使节。他说：
    看吧，
      羡慕吧，
                  我——
                        是苏维埃联盟的
    公民。
                      （“关于苏联照的诗”）
    在马雅可夫斯基爱国主义的诗篇中，不但有着祖国的过去和祖国的现在，而且常常有着“第三个现实”——祖国的未来。他说他“三倍地赞美祖国的将来”。诗人在歌唱人民在国内战争时期的英勇斗争时、歌唱经济恢复时期和斯大林五年计划时期的忘我劳动时，他很清晰地看见了苏维埃祖国发展的远景——共产主义。今天是为了明天，而明天又是建筑在今天的基础上。“我们工作着，好像我们在写着一篇最伟大的史诗”。在马雅可夫斯基的诗篇中，充满了对社会主义祖国的热爱，对共产主义胜利的确信。他热情地歌唱人民在城市和乡村里的创造性的劳动。
    社会主义建设的成就，使马雅可夫斯基计划着写一部关于斯大林五年计划的长诗。但是，诗人只写了长诗的序诗“放开嗓子唱”便逝世了。诗人在这部未完成的长诗的序诗中说道：
      让那在战斗中
                      建成的
                              社会主义
      成为我们
                共同的纪念碑。
    “我们苏维埃时代”的最伟大的诗人并不是“从天空掉下的”，而是从俄罗斯的土地上生长起来的。正如同整个苏维埃文学是继承着并发展了俄罗斯文学的优秀传统一样，马雅可夫斯基也是继承着并发展了表现在普希金、莱蒙托夫、涅克拉索夫创作中的俄罗斯诗歌的优秀传统。马雅可夫斯基继承了他的先驱者们对于诗人崇高使命的看法。
    普希金和莱蒙托夫把诗人叫做“预言者”，湼克拉索夫说诗人首先要成为一个“公民”。马雅可夫斯基继承并发展了他们的传统，把诗人叫做“人民的领导者同时又是人民的勤务员”。他热爱俄罗斯的古典作家，向他们学习，并给他们很高的评价。他在一次讲演中特别讲到他对俄罗斯文学的天才——普希金的爱戴，他说：“在一个月以前，勃里克在工作时候朗诵起我自己也可以背诵的‘叶甫盖尼·奥湼金’来，我听得走不开了，一直听完。以后有两三天的工夫在下面四行诗的感动下走来走去：
    我知道：我的日子已经有限；
    但是为了拖延我的生命，
    我早晨就必须相信，
    在白天我曾和您见面。当然，我们将要几百次地重读这样的作品，甚至于在死神把绞索套向我们脖子的那个时候，我们还要读；我们要几千次地学习这种最诚挚的创作方法，这种方法可以给决定要写的、非写不可的、心灵感到的思想，以无穷尽的满足和最精确的说法。”
    一九二四年苏联庆祝普希金诞生一百二十五周年纪念的时候，马雅可夫斯基写下了著名的诗“纪念日”。他说：“我爱您，但是活的，而不是木乃伊”。同时，在“纪念日”中也提起了湼克拉索夫，这决不是偶然的。马雅可夫斯基这样指出了俄罗斯古典诗歌的传统，而他正就是这优秀传统的当之无愧的继承者。
    马雅可夫斯基继承并发展了俄罗斯诗歌的传统，同时又以一个杰出的诗歌形式革新者而出现。
    马雅可夫斯基反对诗歌中的唯美主义和形式主义，他认为作品最重要的东西是内容。但同时对艺术形式也给以很大的重视。
    马雅可夫斯基在诗歌革新上的功绩首先应当提到的，是用人民口头语言来写诗。他正确地认为，人民就是“语言创造者”。实际上，活的口头语言就是他的作品的基础。
    同时，他又反对语言中不知所云的刻板文字。他在同一篇文章中又说道：“在所有的报纸上直到现在还常常见到一些谁都不明白、不知说什么的词句，如：‘用一根红线贯串着’、‘达到了顶点’、‘达到了最高峰’、‘遭到失败’等等、等等。”　　活的口头语言的应用，同时也决定了马雅可夫斯基诗作的韵律的特点。多少年代以来，在俄罗斯诗歌中使用着“音节重音的”作诗法，马雅可夫斯基扩大了这种作诗法的原则：常常由一种格律转向另一种格律，有的诗行很长，又有的诗行很短，这样可以更好地表达出主题思想的多样性。为了加强诗行的某些地方，他常常把一行诗分列成“楼梯形”。
    马雅可夫斯基在“怎样作诗”中又说道：“没有韵脚（要广义地理解韵脚），诗行就松散了。韵脚可以使你回到前一行，使你联想起它，使讲述一个思想的几行诗结成一体。”马雅可夫斯基的韵脚是多样的，富有表现力的。他又写道：“我常常把最重要的字放在一行的最后，而且想一切办法使它带有韵脚。”这就是说，马雅可夫斯基常常使表示作品基本思想的字押韵。
    这就是马雅可夫斯基在俄罗斯和世界诗歌中带来的新的东西。正就是这些新的形式，才能很好地表达了苏维埃时代的苏维埃爱国主义的新的思想内容。
    对于今天正在为祖国的伟大社会主义事业而奋斗的中国人民、中国青年来说，马雅可夫斯基的诗歌是鼓舞我们进军的响亮的号角；对于正在为社会主义现实主义文学艺术而努力的中国文学艺术家、诗人来说，马雅可夫斯基是我们的伟大的榜样和导师。让我们从这个巨人吸取“创造的和激动的力量”吧！
