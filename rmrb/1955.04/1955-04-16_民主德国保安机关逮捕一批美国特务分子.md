Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 15th: The Press Office of the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement from the Council of Ministers on the 13th, stating: With the assistance of the broad masses, the State Security Organs recently uncovered a large number of spy and sabotage groups, arresting 521 special agents from the American and British intelligence agencies, the Gehlen Organization, and the West Berlin branches of these intelligence agencies. They confiscated 19 American-made radio transceivers and telegraphic code symbols, weapons and ammunition, poisons, incendiary materials, special cameras, maps, forged documents, and a large amount of currency from the German Democratic Republic.

The statement pointed out that these special agent organizations, in the past few months, had attempted to organize assassinations and sabotage activities in the industrial, agricultural, transportation, and commercial networks of the German Democratic Republic.

The statement also pointed out that the uncovered important secret documents, instructions, and directives also proved the criminal activities carried out by these special agents in other countries.

The statement said: The government of the German Democratic Republic demands the immediate disbandment of all spy and sabotage organizations in West Berlin. The government of the German Democratic Republic will take all necessary steps to defend the achievements of workers, farmers, self-employed people, and intellectuals, as well as the lives, health, and property of the people, from the criminal encroachment of the imperialist intelligence agencies.
