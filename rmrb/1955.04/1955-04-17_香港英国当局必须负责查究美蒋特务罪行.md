The heinous assassination incident caused by the sabotage of the plane carrying personnel from the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference and Chinese and foreign journalists by American-Chiang Kai-shek agents has aroused boundless indignation among the broad masses of the Chinese people. They have all condemned this inhumane crime committed by American-Chiang Kai-shek agents and demanded that the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong be responsible for finding out the truth of the incident and swiftly arresting and bringing the murderers and related criminals to justice. However, up to now, the British authorities in Hong Kong have not seriously taken any positive steps to strictly investigate this major international political assassination case. The fact is very clear that the reason American-Chiang Kai-shek agents have been able to carry out this heinous assassination with such impunity is the result of the consistent connivance of the British authorities in Hong Kong with the sabotage activities of American-Chiang Kai-shek agents.

As is well known, Hong Kong has long become a center and base camp for the conspiracies of American-Chiang Kai-shek agents for several years. As early as June 1952, Assistant Secretary of State for the United States Department of State Allison admitted to the Senate Appropriations Committee that the United States Department of State relied on American-Chiang Kai-shek agents in Hong Kong to "obtain real opportunities" to collect a large amount of information about our country. The extraordinarily large organizational scale of the US Consulate General in Hong Kong shows how the American aggressive bloc, with Hong Kong as its main base, is painstakingly carrying out various conspiracies and sabotage activities against our country. The US Consulate General in Hong Kong had only 20-odd people in 1949, but it increased to more than 300 people by 1953. According to the 1953 "Hong Kong Guide," there were as many as 36 personnel at or above the level of vice-consul. The US Central Intelligence Agency, the US "Far East Command Headquarters" in Japan, the US Army Intelligence Service, and the US Naval Intelligence Service have all cleverly established covert names in Hong Kong and set up secret service organizations aimed at undermining our country by various despicable means. According to a report in the Hong Kong "Tian Wen Tai Bao" on July 16 last year, the "Free China Movement" spy organization, headed by Cai Wenzhi, the former director of the Third Department of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's Ministry of National Defense, under the control of the US Central Intelligence Agency alone, has recruited thousands of agents in Hong Kong under the cover of the "Far East Reclamation Company" in the past four years. The Hong Kong "Natural Daily" reported on December 26 last year that the families of many people who were coerced into joining the spy organization in Hong Kong organized a "Seeking Relatives Group" to demand people from the US Consulate in Hong Kong because they had not received any news from their relatives for a long time.

The sabotage activities of American-Chiang Kai-shek secret service agencies in Hong Kong are extremely rampant. The crimes committed by these agents, such as extortion, blackmail, robbery, assassination, and arson, are often seen in the Hong Kong newspapers. For example, General Yang Jie was assassinated by Chiang Kai-shek's agents in September 1949; in April 1950, seven aircraft directly owned by China and Central Aviation Companies under the Civil Aviation Administration of the Central People's Government were blown up by American-Chiang Kai-shek agents at Kai Tak Airport; and in June of the same year, five uprising fishing boats were hijacked by American-Chiang Kai-shek agents in broad daylight. Notorious American secret service leaders Donovan and Cai Wenzhi, and Chiang Kai-shek's secret service bosses Zheng Jiemin and Mao Renfeng, all personally went to Hong Kong to plan sabotage conspiracies against me; the American-Chiang Kai-shek spy cases solved by the Public Security Organs of the People's Republic of China also confirmed that many of them were deployed by American-Chiang Kai-shek secret service agencies through Hong Kong.

It can be seen from this that the American-Chiang Kai-shek secret service group regards Hong Kong as an important base for carrying out sabotage activities against our country. However, the British authorities in Hong Kong never thoroughly investigate the sabotage crimes of the American-Chiang Kai-shek secret service agencies, so that the chief culprits can act even more recklessly. The unprecedented major international political assassination case in which American-Chiang Kai-shek secret service agencies sabotaged the plane carrying the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference is the result of the above-mentioned attitude adopted by the British authorities in Hong Kong. The British government and the Hong Kong authorities must change their consistent attitude of condoning the American-Chiang Kai-shek secret service agencies in carrying out sabotage conspiracies against me and thoroughly investigate this premeditated and deliberate murder case planned by the American-Chiang Kai-shek agents.

    香港英国当局必须负责查究美蒋特务罪行
    赵文
    我国参加亚非会议的代表团工作人员和中外记者座机被美蒋特务破坏所造成的罪恶暗杀事件已引起中国广大人民的无比愤慨。他们纷纷谴责美蒋特务这一灭绝人性的罪行，要求英国政府和香港英国当局负责查明事件的真相，将凶手及有关罪犯迅速逮捕法办。但迄至目前为止，香港英国当局并未认真采取任何积极步骤来严格追究这件重大的国际政治谋杀案件。事实很清楚，美蒋特务能够肆无忌惮地来进行此项罪恶暗杀就是香港英国当局对美蒋特务破坏活动一贯放纵的结果。
    如所周知，几年来香港早已成为美蒋特务的阴谋中心和大本营。早在一九五二年六月，美国国务院助理国务卿艾利逊在参院拨款委员会上供认，美国国务院依靠在香港的美蒋特务人员“获得真正的机会”搜集了大批有关我国的情报。从美国在香港的总领事馆出奇庞大的组织规模就可以看出美国侵略集团以香港为主要根据地如何在处心积虑地展开对我国的各种阴谋破坏活动。美国驻港总领事馆在一九四九年还只有二十余人，到一九五三年就增加到三百余人。据一九五三年“香港指南”所载，其中副领事级以上的人员即达三十六名。美国中央情报局，美国在日本的“远东军总司令部”、美国陆军情报处、美国海军情报处，在香港均巧立掩护名目，设立旨在用各种卑鄙手段破坏我国的特务机构。据去年七月十六日香港“天文台报”消息，单是美国中央情报局掌握下的以前蒋贼国防部第三厅厅长蔡匪文治为首的“自由中国运动”间谍组织，四年来就在香港以“远东垦业公司”为掩护所征募的特务即达数千人之多。去年十二月二十六日香港“自然日报”报道，许多被该间谍组织诱迫参加的人员的在港家属因长期得不到自己亲人的音讯，乃组织“索夫团”向美国驻港领事馆要人。
    美蒋特务机关在香港的破坏活动十分猖獗。这些特务分子所犯的敲诈、勒索、抢劫、暗杀、纵火等罪行，在香港报端屡见不鲜。如一九四九年九月杨杰将军被蒋贼特务暗杀；一九五○年四月我中央人民政府民航局所属中国、中央两航空公司所直接保有的飞机有七架在启德机场被美蒋特务炸毁；同年六月五艘起义渔轮在光天化日之下为美蒋特务所劫持。臭名昭著的美国特务首脑杜诺万、蔡文治、蒋匪特务头子郑介民、毛人凤等均亲至香港策划对我的破坏阴谋活动；我中华人民共和国公安机关所破获的美蒋间谍案件中也证实了很多是美蒋特务机关通过香港布置的。
    由此可见，美蒋特务集团是以香港作为他们对我国进行破坏活动的重要基地的。但是，香港英国当局对美蒋特务机关的破坏罪行却从不进行彻底查究，以致坐令元凶更加横行无忌。美蒋特务机关破坏我国出席亚非会议代表团座机的空前重大国际政治谋杀案就是香港英国当局采取上述态度的结果。英国政府和香港当局必须改变一贯对美蒋特务对我实施破坏阴谋放纵的态度，彻底查明此次美蒋有计划的蓄意谋杀案件。
