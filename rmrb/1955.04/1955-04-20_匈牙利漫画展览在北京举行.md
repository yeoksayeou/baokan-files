Hungarian Cartoon Exhibition Held in Beijing

    The "Hungarian Cartoon Exhibition," sponsored by the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, has been held in Zhongshan Park in the capital since April 4th, along with the "Tenth Anniversary Photo Exhibition of the Hungarian People's Republic." In recent days, the audience has been very crowded and all have shown great interest. On the morning of April 12th, the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations invited art workers from the capital to visit the exhibition. On the afternoon of the 14th, the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations and the Chinese Artists Association jointly held a symposium on the "Hungarian Cartoon Exhibition" at the exhibition venue. Among those attending the symposium were the Hungarian cartoonist currently visiting China, Tibor Donászy, the editor of the Hungarian cartoon newspaper "Matyi the Gooseherd," Ye Qianyu, vice chairman of the Chinese Artists Association, and more than 20 cartoonists and young cartoon workers from the capital. At the symposium, Tibor Donászy introduced the work and life of Hungarian cartoonists and the situation of the "Matyi the Gooseherd" editorial department. The cartoon workers present greatly admired the exhibited Hungarian cartoons, and unanimously agreed that Hungarian cartoonists have a very high level of political and artistic accomplishment. They have a strong political sensitivity, often delve into the lives of the masses, and fully grasp and utilize the humorous characteristics of cartoons, clearly, profoundly, and cleverly expressing various meaningful themes. This is the fundamental reason why the works of Hungarian cartoonists can arouse the interest of readers, move them, and have an educational effect. At the same time, everyone believes that the wide range of subjects, the diversity of styles, and the novel and interesting expression methods of Hungarian cartoonists' works are worthy of learning for Chinese cartoon workers.
