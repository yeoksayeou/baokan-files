Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 29th: Tokyo News: The Japanese Diet has been conducting policy debates since the 27th. The Hatoyama government's negative attitude towards Sino-Japanese trade has been sharply criticized by opposition parties.

Left-wing Socialist Party member Masaru Nomizo criticized the Hatoyama government for lacking independence in diplomacy. He said: Although Prime Minister Hatoyama often says verbally that he wants to adjust relations between Japan and China, he has adopted an unenthusiastic attitude towards the new Sino-Japanese trade agreement negotiations currently underway in Tokyo.

Right-wing Socialist Party member Inejiro Asanuma criticized the Hatoyama government's dependence on the United States and demanded the development of trade with China and the normalization of relations between the two countries.

Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu, in response to questions from Diet members, stated that he would make the greatest efforts to promote Sino-Japanese trade. However, when it came to practical measures that are important for promoting Sino-Japanese trade, he changed his tone and said that it was "too early" to establish resident trade representative offices in each other's countries and provide guarantees for trade payment agreements.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 29th: Negotiations on the Sino-Japanese trade agreement failed to reach an agreement as scheduled because the Japanese government avoided taking responsibility. Representatives of the two Japanese negotiating groups—the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Sino-Japanese Trade—requested the government to extend the stay of the Chinese trade delegation.

On the 26th, the Japanese Foreign Ministry authorities replied to the two Japanese negotiating groups, stating: The application for extending the stay of the Chinese trade delegation submitted by the two groups will not be accepted. The reply also asked the Chinese trade delegation to leave Japan quickly.

Xie Xiaonai, Secretary-General of the Chinese Trade Delegation to Japan, questioned Koichi Yamamoto, Secretary-General of the Japanese negotiating groups, on the evening of the 27th. Secretary-General Xie Xiaonai said in the questioning: From the day the Chinese trade delegation arrived in Japan, it has negotiated trade agreements with the Japanese side with a positive attitude and utmost sincerity. In order to quickly reach an agreement between the two sides, we have repeatedly put forward reasonable, practical and feasible suggestions; however, the Japanese side has adopted a negative attitude and repeatedly delayed the time, so that the negotiations could not proceed smoothly. Therefore, the responsibility lies entirely with the Japanese side. The Chinese trade delegation cannot but pay serious attention to the attitude of the Japanese Foreign Ministry authorities.

On the afternoon of the 28th, Masanosuke Ikeda, representing the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Sino-Japanese Trade, apologized to Lei Renmin, head of the Chinese trade delegation. After visiting Lei Renmin, Ikeda met with Japanese reporters and made a statement on the unreasonable attitude of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, clarifying the responsibility for this issue, and pointed out that the Japanese Foreign Ministry's practice was in violation of international etiquette and was disrespectful to the Chinese trade delegation.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 29th: "The Nikkei Economic Journal" reported today that the Japanese Foreign Ministry admitted that it was wrong to refuse to accept the application submitted by the two Japanese trade negotiating groups for an extension of the stay of the Chinese trade delegation visiting Japan. The Foreign Ministry has now withdrawn its original reply to the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Sino-Japanese Trade regarding the non-acceptance of the extension application.

    日在野党派抨击鸠山政府对中日贸易消极
    日本政府在国会和人民压力下延长我贸易代表团访问期限
    新华社二十九日讯　东京消息：日本国会从二十七日起进行政策辩论。鸠山政府对中日贸易的消极态度遭到在野党派尖锐的抨击。
    左派社会党议员野沟胜指责鸠山政府在外交上缺乏独立自主性。他说：鸠山首相虽然经常在口头上说要调整日本和中国的邦交，但是却对正在东京进行的新中日贸易协议谈判采取了不是积极的态度。
    右派社会党议员浅沼稻次郎指责鸠山政府对美国的依赖，并且要求发展同中国的贸易和使中日两国的关系正常化。
    外务相重光葵在答复议员们的质询时表示要尽最大的努力来促进日中贸易，但是在接触到对促进日中贸易有重要关系的实际措施时，他就改变口吻说：中日两国互设常驻贸易代表机构和对贸易支付协定提供保证，目前“还为时过早”。
    据新华社东京二十九日电　中日贸易协议谈判由于日本政府避不承担应负的责任而未能如期达成协议。日本两个谈判团体——日本国际贸易促进协会和日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟的代表，曾向政府要求延长中国贸易代表团的访日期限。
    日本外务省当局在二十六日答复日本两谈判团体说：对两团体为中国贸易代表团申请延长留日期限一事，表示不予受理。答复并要中国贸易代表团迅速离开日本。
    中国访问日本贸易代表团秘书长谢筱乃在二十七日晚向日本谈判团体的事务总长山本熊一提出质问。谢筱乃秘书长在质问中说：中国贸易代表团从来到日本的那一天起，就以积极的态度和最大的诚意同日本方面商谈贸易协议。为了迅速使双方达成协议，我们曾一再提出合理的实际可行的建议；但日本方面却采取消极态度，一再拖延时间，以致谈判不能顺利进行，因此责任完全在于日本方面。中国贸易代表团对日本外务省当局的态度不能不引起严重注意。
    二十八日下午，池田正之辅代表日本国际贸易促进协会和日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟向中国贸易代表团雷任民团长道歉。池田正之辅在访问了雷任民团长后接见了日本记者，就日本外务省的不合理态度发表谈话，澄清了这一问题的责任，指出日本外务省的这种作法是违反国际礼节，对中国贸易代表团有失礼貌。
    新华社东京二十九日电　“日本经济新闻”今天报道，日本外务省承认不受理日本两谈判贸易团体为中国访日贸易代表团申请延长留日期限一事是办错了。现在外务省已撤回原来给日本国际贸易促进协会和日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟的关于不受理延长申请的答复。
