In the construction of the First Automobile Works, a large number of factory-produced prefabricated construction methods were adopted. Before the arrival of last winter, the body panel stamping workshop, composed of more than 20,000 components, was assembled in just one month using only three 20-ton cranes and about one hundred crane operators. The service building of the foundry shop is a three-story building. This building, constructed from more than 3,000 large prefabricated components, was built at a rate of one floor every six days with two cranes and more than thirty workers. Around these buildings, one can no longer see construction scaffolding or busy crowds; over 96% of the heavy, tiring labor and high-altitude work have been replaced by machinery. Using this factory-produced prefabricated construction method, seven major factory buildings have already been completed.

The prefabricated components needed for factory-produced prefabricated construction are all pre-produced in processing plants. Around the First Automobile Works' rebar prefabrication plant, metal structure plant, concrete mixing plant, foamed concrete plant, and timber processing plant, there are piles of sand, gravel, rebar, cement, and wood. During periods of intense construction work, these plants receive over ten thousand tons of building materials and ship out over a thousand types of reinforced concrete prefabricated components every day.

Recently, I visited a factory building equipped with concrete mixers. Here, after workers use sand screening machines to remove dust and substandard stones from the gravel, it is steam-heated, weighed, batched, and then sent to the mixers. At the discharge point, workers use tipping dump trucks to transport the mixed concrete to various steel and wooden molds for pouring. Then, vibrators and vibrating tables are used to compact it, and it is then pushed into the curing room. Once it reaches a certain strength, it is sent to the construction site for installation. Concrete prefabricates produced in this factory can be transported to the work area for installation after 30 hours of steam curing, while on-site casting using open-air natural curing takes more than 20 days to reach the required strength. Stepping out of this factory building, next to a huge finished product storage yard on the north side, a tank-style crane is loading five- to six-ton reinforced concrete prefabricated beams onto flatbed trailers. Last year, the various processing plants transported 360,000 tons of components and building materials to the construction site. Because the components needed for the buildings are prefabricated by the processing plants starting when earthwork excavation begins, the construction period of many major projects has been greatly shortened compared to the past decentralized on-site casting handicraft-style construction methods.

Specialized production by processing plants also allows for the use of advanced technical equipment to prefabricate high-quality components for buildings. We saw that the components sent from the processing plants to the work area are particularly smooth and dense, with almost no honeycomb or pitted surfaces. Last year, the state stipulated that the scrap rate for reinforced concrete prefabricates should be 1%, but their actual scrap rate was only 0.5%. The strength of the concrete components produced by the concrete mixing plant, tested by experiments, was better than the prescribed standards, and the consumption of raw materials was also lower than the state-specified quotas. Since last year, the metal structure and rebar prefabrication plant has saved the state more than 300 tons of steel by reducing consumption quotas.

In these specialized production processing plants, the growth of technical expertise is particularly noteworthy. Among the more than 160 concrete workers in the rebar prefabrication plant's prefabrication workshop, only 14 were originally Grade One concrete workers; the rest were young farmers from the countryside. They had never seen machines or concrete. When they first started learning to operate, they produced scrap products but couldn't find the cause. Now, they can all skillfully master the mix proportions of more than a dozen concrete grades. Each person used to make a roof panel in 27 minutes; now they have increased the speed to making one in only 3 minutes.

This year, the proportion of factory-produced prefabricated construction at the First Automobile Works has increased even further. More than ten projects originally designed for on-site casting and manual bricklaying have also been converted to prefabricated large-scale components in processing plants and implemented with prefabricated construction. This will further accelerate the construction progress of the final batch of projects at the First Automobile Works.

    第一汽车制造厂的工厂化装配式施工
    新华社记者　陈子林
    在第一汽车制造厂的建设中，大量地采用了工厂化装配式施工方法。去年冬季到来前夕，由两万多个构件组成的车身压制工场，只用三部二十吨起重机和一百个左右起重工人，在一个月中就装配完了。铸工场生活间是一座三层楼房的建筑物。这座由三千多块大型预制构件构成的房屋，用两部起重机，三十多个工人六天就建成了一层楼房。在这些建筑物周围，人们已看不到建筑脚手架和忙乱的人群，百分之九十六以上的笨重累人的劳动和高空作业，都由机械代替。用这种工厂化装配式施工方法，已建成了七个主要厂房。
    进行工厂化装配式施工所需要的预制构件，都是在加工厂里预先生产出来的。在第一汽车制造厂的钢筋预制厂、金属结构厂、混凝土搅拌厂、泡沫混凝土厂、木材加工厂的四周，到处是堆积如山的砂石、钢筋、水泥、木材。在施工工作紧张时，这里每天要运进上万吨建筑材料，运出一千多种钢筋混凝土预制构件。
    最近，记者参观了一座安装着混凝土搅拌机的厂房。砂石在这里经过工人利用筛砂机筛去灰土和不合格的石子后，再经蒸汽加热、过磅、配料就送进搅拌机。在出料地方由工人们用倾卸斗车，将搅拌好的混凝土，运到各个钢模和木模进行浇灌，接着由振动器和振动台把它振动密实，然后推进保养间，到一定强度就送到工地进行安装了。在这个厂生产的混凝土预制品，用蒸气保养三十个小时就可运往工区安装，而在现场就地浇灌采用露天自然保养，需要二十多天才能达到需要的强度。走出这个厂房，在北面一个庞大的成品堆置场旁边，坦克式起重机正把五六吨重的钢筋混凝土预制梁向平板拖车上装运。去年一年中由各加工场运到施工现场的构件和建筑材料有三十六万吨。因为建筑物所需的构件，在挖掘土方开始时就由加工厂先行预制，所以很多主要工程的工期，都较过去分散的就地浇灌的手工业式施工方法大大缩短了。
    由加工厂进行专业生产，还可以采用先进的技术设备为建筑物预制出质量良好的构件。我们看到凡是由加工厂送到工区的构件，特别光滑密实，几乎看不到蜂窝或麻面的产品。去年，国家规定钢筋预制品废品率为百分之一，但他们的废品率实际上只有百分之零点五。混凝土搅拌厂生产的混凝土构件的强度，经试验都比规定的要好，原材料的消耗也都低于国家规定的定额。金属结构和钢筋预制厂，从去年以来，因降低消耗定额已为国家节省了三百多吨钢材。
    在这些专业化生产的加工厂里，特别令人注意的是技术力量的成长。钢筋预制厂预制车间的一百六十多个混凝土工人中，原来只有十四个是一级混凝土工，其余都是来自农村的青年农民。他们没有见过机器、也没有见过混凝土。开始学习操作时，出了废品也找不出原因。现在他们都能熟练地掌握十几种混凝土标号的配合比了。每人做屋面板，由开始二十七分钟做一块，提高到只用三分钟做一块。
    今年，第一汽车制造厂工厂化装配式施工比重更加提高了。原来设计为就地浇灌和人工砌墙的十多项工程，也已改为在加工厂预制成大块构件，实行装配式施工。这样就可以更加加快第一汽车制造厂最后一批工程的建设进度。（附图片）
