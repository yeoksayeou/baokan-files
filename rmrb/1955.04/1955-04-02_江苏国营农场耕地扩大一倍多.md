Jiangsu State-owned Dongxin, Huaihai, Lianhu, Qingyihu, Baoyinghu, Fengxian, and Yuntai seven mechanical farms in Jiangsu Province continue to reclaim wasteland and expand cultivated area. This year their planting area will reach more than 154,900 mu, an increase of one and a half times compared to 1954. This year, these seven farms plan to produce more than 12.7 million jin of grain for the country, equivalent to the total grain output from 1950 to 1954. This year, the area planted with cotton in each farm will also be expanded by nearly three and a half times compared to last year, producing more than 1.2 million jin of ginned cotton.

The mechanization power of each farm has also greatly increased. The province's farms originally had 59 large, medium, and small tractors, and this year another 22 have been added, totaling 2,475 horsepower. If these tractors are started together, they can plow more than 5,000 mu of land per day. Due to the improvement of mechanization, the physical labor intensity of agricultural workers has been greatly reduced, and costs have been reduced. The main crop of the Dongxin Farm, wheat, has a planting area of more than 26,000 mu, with only 55 workers, and the planned cost of each mu of wheat is about 9.7 yuan, a decrease of 15.8 percent compared to 1954.

    江苏国营农场耕地扩大一倍多
    江苏省国营东辛、淮海、练湖、青伊湖、宝应湖、奉贤、云台七个机械农场，继续开垦荒地，扩大耕种面积。今年它们的种植面积将达十五万四千九百多亩，比一九五四年扩大一倍半。这七个农场今年计划为国家生产粮食一千二百七十多万斤，相当于一九五○年到一九五四年五年来的粮食总产量。今年各场种植棉花的面积也将比去年扩大近三倍半，可生产皮棉一百二十多万斤。
    各场的机械化力量也有很大增长。全省农场原有大、中、小型拖拉机五十九台，今年又增加二十二台，共达二千四百七十五马力。这些拖拉机若一起开动，每天可翻地五千亩以上。由于机械化程度的提高，大大减轻了农业工人的体力劳动强度，并降低了成本。东辛农场主要作物小麦的播种面积有二万六千多亩，仅配备工人五十五名，每亩小麦计划成本为九元七角左右，比一九五四年降低百分之十五点八。（邵之一）
