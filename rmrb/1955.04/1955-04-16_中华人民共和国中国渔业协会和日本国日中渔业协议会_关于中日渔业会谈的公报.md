Public Communiqué on Sino-Japanese Fishery Talks Between the China Fisheries Association of the People's Republic of China and the Japan-China Fisheries Council of Japan

From January 13th to April 15th, 1955, the delegation of the China Fisheries Association of the People's Republic of China, headed by Yang Yu, head of the delegation, and Gao Shuyi, deputy head of the delegation, and the delegation of the Japan-China Fisheries Council of Japan, headed by Suekichi Shichida, head of the delegation, and Satarō Murayama and Kininosuke Yamazaki, deputy heads of the delegation, held talks on fishery issues in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea in a spirit of friendship and mutual understanding. After full consultation, an agreement has now been signed. And signed in Beijing on April 15.

In the agreement, the delegation of the China Fisheries Association and the delegation of the Japan-China Fisheries Council, based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, made reasonable arrangements for the fishing issues in certain sea areas of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea between the fishery circles of China and Japan. Provisions are made for "Regulations on Maintaining the Order of Fishing Vessel Operations," "Regulations on Handling Matters After Emergency Berthing and Rescue of Maritime Disasters of Fishing Vessels," and "Regulations on the Exchange of Fishery Information and the Exchange of Technology." This agreement embodies the desire of mutual understanding and friendly cooperation between the fishery circles of China and Japan. It is contributing to the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations and the enhancement of friendship between the people of China and Japan.

Since normal relations have not yet been restored between China and Japan, the fishery agreement reached between the non-governmental fishery organizations of China and Japan can only be temporary and limited in nature. Therefore, the China Fisheries Association and the Japan-China Fisheries Council are willing to work together to urge their respective governments to promptly hold Sino-Japanese fishery negotiations and sign a fishery agreement between the governments of China and Japan while implementing this agreement.

    中华人民共和国中国渔业协会和日本国日中渔业协议会
    关于中日渔业会谈的公报
    从一九五五年一月十三日起到四月十五日止，中华人民共和国中国渔业协会以团长杨煜、副团长高树颐为首的代表团和日本国日中渔业协议会以团长七田末吉、副团长村山佐太郎、山崎喜之助为首的代表团就黄海、东海的渔业问题在友好和相互谅解的精神下举行了会谈。经过充分的协商，现在已经签订协定。并在四月十五日在北京签字。
    在协定中，中国渔业协会代表团和日本日中渔业协议会代表团根据平等互利、和平共处的原则，对中日两国渔业界在黄海、东海的一定海域的捕鱼问题作了合理的安排。规定了“关于维持渔船作业秩序的规定”、“关于渔船因紧急事故寄泊和救助海难后处理办法的规定”和“关于交换渔业资料和交流技术的规定”。这个协定体现了中日两国渔业界相互谅解和友好合作的愿望。对于促进中日两国关系的改善、增进中日两国人民的友谊是有贡献的。
    由于中日两国之间尚未恢复正常关系，中日两国民间渔业团体之间所达成的渔业协定只能是临时性质的和具有局限性的。因此，中国渔业协会和日本日中渔业协议会在执行这个协定的同时，愿意各自为促请本国政府迅速举行中日渔业谈判、签订中日两国政府之间的渔业协定而努力。
                    一九五五年四月十五日
