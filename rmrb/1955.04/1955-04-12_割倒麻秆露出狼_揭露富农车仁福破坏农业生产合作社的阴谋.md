    "Cut Down the Hemp and Reveal the Wolf"
    ——Exposing the Rich Peasant Che Renfu's Conspiracy to Sabotage the Agricultural Producers' Cooperative
    Huang Ke, Jun Ming

    The case of the "Radiant Light" Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Northwest Village, Kaoshan Village, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, being manipulated and sabotaged by the new rich peasant Che Renfu illustrates that the sabotage of cooperatives by rich peasant elements is all-pervasive. In general, they pretend to be "honest" and put on a smiling face to lull people, attempting to change the nature of the cooperative. However, in areas where the work foundation is weak, they will blatantly engage in activities, trying their best to bring the cooperative down. But no matter how insidious and vicious the saboteurs are, they can only deceive for a while and run rampant for a while, and will ultimately not escape the eyes of the people and the net of the people's law.

    Northwest Village is a village with a relatively weak work foundation in Kaoshan Village. There is not a single Party member in the village, only four Communist Youth League members, two of whom are the younger brothers of the rich peasant element Che Renfu. After these two joined the League, they hung a "progressive" sign on the Che family, causing people to lose their due vigilance towards them and creating convenient conditions for Che Renfu's sabotage activities. The conditions for establishing a cooperative in this village were not very sufficient. The village cadres felt that this was the only village among all the villages that did not have a cooperative. In order to "catch up with the advanced," they established a cooperative of seventeen households in the spring of 1954. When the cooperative was established, Che Renfu could not figure out the situation, so he went to Guan Nei to avoid trouble under the pretext of visiting relatives. After he came back, his two younger brothers had already joined the cooperative. Seeing that what was done could not be undone, he came up with a "ride the tide" plan, took the opportunity to join the cooperative, and planned to destroy it.

    After Che Renfu joined the cooperative, he began to attempt to usurp the leadership of the cooperative. He often showed in front of the cooperative members that he was very concerned about the production in the cooperative. He said, "This really has to be done well! Such a large family business, if the production is not well planned and cannot be adjusted, it won't work!" When he saw that the cadres did not have many methods for organizing collective production, he said, "I have managed a lot of land, and I have figured out this set of things. It's really not simple!" The newly established cooperative had inexperienced leaders, few and weak backbone members, and low mass awareness. Gradually, the cooperative cadres were deceived by him, and some cooperative members also said, "Che Renfu really has two tricks for production." So they elected him as the production committee member, and from then on, Che Renfu climbed to a leadership position.

    The cooperative director Gao Fengpeng, management committee member Zhang Xishan, and production team leader Zhou Jingchun were the backbone members of the cooperative. These people were all honest peasants, wholeheartedly wanting to run the cooperative well, and were not very vigilant against saboteurs. Seeing that there was an opportunity, Che Renfu spread rumors such as "Zhang Xishan did not become the director and is not convinced in his heart, wanting to seize the director's position" and "Zhang Xishan does not obey the director's leadership," plotting to provoke the relationship between these key backbone members. Gao Fengpeng did not care at first, but after hearing it many times, he also became a little suspicious. Sometimes, when he and Zhang Xishan had some disagreements on work, Gao Fengpeng felt that what Che Renfu said seemed to make sense, and gradually became dissatisfied with Zhang Xishan. Seeing that the time had come, Che Renfu hurriedly instructed his third brother, Che Renlong, to report to the Party branch in the name of a Communist Youth League member. Upon hearing this, the branch secretary Yu Tianren hurriedly went to Northwest Village with the village chief to solve the problem. In public, he severely criticized Zhang Xishan and removed him from his position as a member of the management committee.

    Che Renfu's conspiracy was not discovered, so he became even bolder and further carried out his sabotage activities in the cooperative. The young accountant Yu Gengxi liked to listen to flattery a little, so Che Renfu constantly praised him in crowded places. After the two became close, Che Renfu took the opportunity to give Yu a small piglet. The deputy director of the cooperative, Meng Fanyou, was a well-to-do middle peasant. He was a little reluctant to join the cooperative, so Che Renfu understood Meng Fanyou's mood and pretended to be extremely sympathetic, often chatting with Meng, saying:
  "Old Meng, how did you get caught in this halter?" The production team leader Zhou Jingchun was very active in leading production, so he tried to attack Zhou. The honest and fair feeder Wang Yu, Che Renfu could not find an opportunity to attack him. By chance, Wang Yu was away on business one day, and Che Renfu took the opportunity to release the horse into the land of the notorious rascal Ma Yunlong, and ate a large area of grain. On the one hand, he tried his best to instigate the Ma family to come to the cooperative to make trouble. On the other hand, he said to the cooperative members: "Wang Yu is careless in letting the horse go, and he is doing his own work at home all day long, letting the horse run in other people's fields, causing the cooperative to be scolded by everyone. This is not acceptable." In this way, he removed Wang Yu in the name of "dereliction of duty" and replaced him with his confidant Sun Hai as the feeder.

    The cadres and masses in this village thought that the land reform had long been completed, so what class struggle was there? They were even more unclear about the class enemies in the village. Che Renfu's series of provocations and sabotage also aroused the suspicion of some cooperative members, and these cooperative members also fought against him, but this did not arouse the due vigilance and attention of the cooperative cadres. Instead, they blamed each other: Zhang Xishan and Zhou Jingchun thought that Gao Fengpeng had "changed his mind" after becoming the director, and Wang Yu said, "I'm old, and I don't suit the director's temper!" The dissatisfied were dissatisfied, and the passive were passive, which caused great difficulties in the work of the cooperative.

    Whether the cooperative can increase production is the key to whether the cooperative can be consolidated. The rich peasant element Che Renfu understood this. His sabotage activities in production were even more vicious and diverse. After Che Renfu became the production committee member, he often promoted his rich production experience, saying, "Usually I obey the director's leadership, but the director must listen to me in production." When sowing spring wheat, Che Renfu held the plow and deliberately placed the shuttle shallowly (controlling the depth of the plow), so that the soil could not cover the wheat seeds, and also said, "I said it was too early to plant, but no one believed me. Look, the plow cannot cut through the soil." After the director and some cooperative members raised their opinions to him, he deliberately placed the shuttle deeply the next day, breaking the plow beam and breaking two plowshares. When planting millet was tense, Che Renfu took advantage of the fact that people were not paying attention and deliberately let the horse run away, causing everyone to spend the whole morning catching the horse, and five plows did not go to the ground. During the Dragon Boat Festival, the cooperative was busy weeding the fields for the first time. Che Renfu said to the cooperative members, "It's New Year's and festivals, even the little ghosts and gods have to rest, not to mention people. We have to rest for a few days during the Dragon Boat Festival." It just so happened that the director went to the county for a meeting, so they took a three-day vacation in a muddle. At wheat harvest time, all the cooperatives were busy harvesting wheat. They finally borrowed a harvester from another cooperative, and the technician repeatedly told them that the horse was easily frightened and should be brought with a rein (that is, the rope pulling the horse's mouth). Che Renfu personally drove the horse for the harvester, deliberately not bringing a rein. When the horse saw the strange arm shaking on the harvester and heard the clicking sound, it became frightened. He took the opportunity to hit the horse hard, and the horse ran and jumped all over the ground, smashing the rake of the harvester and trampling a large area of wheat. The harvester could not be used, and compensation had to be paid for repairs. Under Che Renfu's various obstructions and sabotage, the production of this cooperative was more backward than the production of other cooperatives and groups in the village. Due to poor sowing, the wheat was missing 40% of the seedlings. The masses in this village reflected, "Our cooperative is taking the lead backwards!"

    Some cooperative members had fought against Che Renfu several times for these sabotage activities, but a force to fight against the saboteurs could not be formed in the cooperative. There was no Party leadership in the village, some people were passive and did not care, and some people were anxious. Some cooperative members felt more and more that there was a problem, so they reported the situation to the Party branch. In July, the branch sent someone to Northwest Village to hold a cooperative members' meeting and removed Che Renfu from his position as a production committee member. At the time of the removal, because the cooperative members and all the villagers were not fully mobilized to expose Che Renfu's sabotage behavior, so as to improve the understanding and awareness of the cooperative members, although Che Renfu's position was removed, it did not prevent him from continuing to engage in sabotage activities.

    After being dismissed, Che Renfu did not go to the ground to participate in the cooperative's production at all. He used the time when the cooperative members and team members were going to the ground for production during the day to go deep into the homes of cooperative members and mutual aid group members to continue to engage in sabotage activities. He said to the deputy director Meng Fanyou, "Old Meng, only our two families in the cooperative have more carts and horses. They are all just two shoulders carrying a mouth, what do they have!" He also said, "If we step on and crush two seedlings, we will be criticized by them (Meng Fanyou was criticized for crushing seedlings). This is called having merit but not being recognized, and being punished for a small mistake. Why should we suffer this humiliation!" After talking back and forth, Meng Fanyou also began to waver. As a result of Che Renfu's activities in the cooperative, eight of the eighteen cooperative members wavered and planned to withdraw from the cooperative after the autumn. In addition, Che Renfu often went to the mutual aid groups to engage in sabotage activities. He said to the well-to-do middle peasant Ji Chunyu, "What good is that cooperative thing for a household like yours? I wouldn't say this to anyone but you." He said to Yu Gengli, who was physically weak, "Joining the cooperative is like carrying a heavy burden. With a body like yours, you will be exhausted if you join the cooperative. If you want to live two more years, don't join the cooperative. Let's form a small group during the New Year." In this way, Che Renfu went from house to house, from inside the cooperative to outside the cooperative, from well-to-do households to households in difficulty, saying different things to different people to sabotage the cooperative, which made many cooperative members lose confidence in running the cooperative, and many group members gave up the idea of joining the cooperative.

    It was not until the county party committee work team arrived in this village in the winter of 1954 that some poor peasants and new middle peasant cooperative members reported Che Renfu's sabotage behavior to the work team. After the work team held a forum for poor peasants and a forum for activists, Che Renfu's rich peasant face and sabotage crimes were completely exposed. Che Renfu was a well-to-do middle peasant during the land reform. After the land reform, he gradually developed into a rich peasant by organizing fake mutual aid groups, hiring long-term workers, lending money at high interest rates, and smuggling horses to evade taxes. He looked for poor households with no carts and horses and a lot of labor every year to form groups, and hired a large number of short-term workers during the busy farming season. Until he joined the cooperative, his family had six horses, four cattle, one cart, and twenty-three or four hectares of land. Because his younger brother was a Communist Youth League member, Che Renfu mixed into the cooperative under the banner of "progress" and carried out various activities. In the past, the Party branch had carried out rectification several times and removed Che Renfu from his position as a production committee member, but it had never clearly drawn the class line. This time, everyone recognized the true face of this class enemy.

    At the forum, everyone angrily counted Che Renfu's sabotage crimes one by one. Many things that they could not figure out in the past became clear after comparison. Zhang Xishan said, "It turned out that a mouse was stirring up the whole pot." The cooperative members could not suppress their anger and filed a complaint with the Keshan County People's Court. The rich peasant saboteur Che Renfu was finally arrested and punished according to the law and received the punishment he deserved, and the masses in the whole village were also greatly educated. The village branch secretary said, "In the past, it seemed that we only heard the sound of the pulley, but we didn't know where the well was. We couldn't see clearly, we couldn't figure it out, we didn't dare to fight, and we rectified it several times, but the medicine was not right." The deputy village chief said, "In the past, when we went to Northwest Village, it was like entering a 'maze'. This is the first time we have lifted the lid." Meng Fanyou and Yu Gengxi, who had been drawn in by Che Renfu, also woke up and were very remorseful that they had been fooled by Che Renfu, and angrily exposed Che Renfu's despicable behavior. The cooperative members who had been provoked and were not united also made self-criticisms. The eight wavering cooperative members also said, "Now that the root of the disease has been removed, why should we withdraw from the cooperative!" The peasants who had been deceived by Che Renfu's rumors said, "This is really cutting down the hemp and revealing the wolf, which has brightened our eyes." The mutual aid group leader Zhang Yongjiang said, "Everyone is taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation, and Che Renfu has no way to exploit us. The Communist Party has liberated us, and Che Renfu wants to throw us back into the mud pit!" The thinking inside and outside the cooperative was clarified, the enthusiasm of the poor peasants and middle peasants was high, and sixteen more peasant households joined the cooperative. All the peasants in the village felt like they had attended a large class.

    “割倒麻秆露出狼”
    ——揭露富农车仁福破坏农业生产合作社的阴谋
    黄克　俊明
    黑龙江省克山县靠山村西北屯“光芒万丈”农业生产合作社被新富农车仁福操纵破坏的经过说明：富农分子对合作社的破坏是无孔不入的。在一般情况下，他们假装“老实”，扮出笑脸来麻痹人，企图把社变质；但在工作基础薄弱的地方，他就会明目张胆地活动，极力想把社搞垮。但是，不管破坏分子有多么阴险毒辣，也只能蒙蔽一时，猖狂一时，终归逃不出人民的眼睛和人民的法网。
    西北屯是靠山村一个工作基础较薄弱的屯子，屯里没有一个党员，只有四个青年团员，其中有两个是富农分子车仁福的弟弟。这两个人混进团里后，就给车家挂上了“进步”的招牌，使人们失去了对他们应有的警惕，为车仁福造下了破坏活动的便利条件。这个屯建社条件本来不大够，屯里干部觉得全村几个屯就这里没社，为了“赶先进”，在一九五四年春季建立了一个十七户的合作社。建社时车仁福还摸不清底细，借口探亲就去关内躲风；回来后，他的两个弟弟已经入了社。他看到木已成舟，就来了个“顺水推舟”，乘机混入社打算把社搅垮。
    车仁福入社以后，开始就企图篡夺社的领导权。他经常在社员面前表现他很关心社内的生产，他说：“这可真得好好搞呀！这么大家业，生产上计划不好，调不开扇，可不行啊！”当他看到干部组织集体生产办法不多时，就说：“我经营的地多，我算摸清这一套啦，可真不简单！”新建起的社，领导没经验，骨干少又弱，群众觉悟又低，慢慢社干部就受了他的蒙蔽，有些社员也说：“车仁福搞生产还是有两套。”于是就推举他当生产委员，从此车仁福就爬上了领导岗位。
    社主任高凤鹏、管理委员张喜山、生产队长周景春等几个人是办社的骨干。这几个人都是老实农民，一心只是想把社办好，对破坏分子的警惕性不高。车仁福见到有机可乘，就散布“张喜山没当上主任，心里不服气，想夺主任地位”，“张喜山不服从主任领导”，等等谣言，阴谋挑拨这几个主要骨干的关系。高凤鹏起初还不介意；可是，听的次数多了，也有点怀疑，有时和张喜山两人因工作意见有些不一致，高凤鹏就觉得车仁福说的似乎有理，渐渐也就对张喜山不满。车仁福看时机已到，忙吩咐他的三弟车仁龙利用青年团员的名义到党支部汇报。支部书记于天仁一听急忙和村长到西北屯来解决问题；当众狠狠地把张喜山批评了一顿，撤掉了张喜山的管理委员会委员的职务。
    车仁福的阴谋没有被发觉，就更大胆地进一步地在社内进行他的破坏活动。年青的会计于庚喜有点爱听别人奉承，车仁福就在人多的地方不断地夸奖他；两人拉的亲近了，车仁福就趁机送给于一个小猪崽。社的副主任孟范有是个富裕中农，入社时多少有点勉强，车仁福了解孟范有这种心情，就装着一副极其同情的面孔，经常和孟闲谈，说：
  “老孟，你怎么也上了这笼头。”生产队长周景春领导生产很积极，他就想法打击周。老实公道的饲养员王玉，车仁福找不到打击他的机会。可巧有一天王玉有事不在，车仁福趁机把马解开放到有名的无赖马云龙的地里，把谷子吃了一大片。他一方面极力唆使马家父子到社里来吵闹；一方面对社员们说：“王玉放马不经心，成天在家干自己的活，让马跑在人家地里，叫合作社大伙跟着挨骂，这样可不行。”就这样以“失职”为名撤掉了王玉，换上了自己的心腹孙海当饲养员。
    这个屯的干部和群众都以为土地改革早已完成了，还有什么阶级斗争？对屯子里的阶级敌人，他们更是看不清楚。车仁福这一系列的挑拨破坏，也引起过有些社员的怀疑，这些社员也和他进行过斗争，但并没有引起社干部应有的警惕和注意。他们反而互相埋怨：张喜山和周景春以为高凤鹏当了主任“变了心”，王玉说：“咱老了，不合主任脾味！”不满的不满，消极的消极，使社的工作遭到极大的困难。
    合作社能否增产，是社能否巩固的关键。富农分子车仁福懂得这一点；他在生产上的破坏活动是更加狠毒和多样的。车仁福当了生产委员后，就经常宣传他的生产经验丰富，他说：“平常我服从主任领导，在生产上主任可得听我吩咐。”春小麦播种时，车仁福扶犁，故意浅放梭（管犁深浅的），使土盖不上麦种，还说“我说种的太早，别人都不信，你看犁杖削不动”。主任和部分社员向他提出意见后，第二天他又故意深放梭，把犁辕拉拆，铧子碎了两张。种谷子正紧张时，车仁福趁人不注意故意把马放跑了，使大家忙着抓了一上午马，五付犁杖没下地。过五月节时，社里正在紧张地铲头遍地，车仁福向社员们讲：“过年过节了，小鬼小神也要歇歇，别说是人，五月节咱们可得歇几天。”恰好主任到县开会去了，就胡里胡涂放假三天。麦收时，各社都忙着收麦，好不容易向别的社借了一台收割机，技术手再三嘱咐：马易受惊要带溜纲（即拉马嘴的绳）。车仁福亲自来赶收割机的马，故意不带溜纲。马一看收割机摇动着的怪臂，听到咔咔的响声，惊悸起来。他就趁机用劲打马，马满地乱跑乱跳，把收割机的耙子碰得粉碎，麦子踏坏了一大片。收割机没使成，还得包赔修理。在车仁福的各种阻挠破坏下，这个社的生产比全村其他社、组的生产都落后，小麦因下种不好缺四成苗。这个屯的群众反映：“我们这个社带头是往后带哩！”
    车仁福这些破坏活动，有些社员曾几次向他进行斗争，但社内却形不成一个向破坏分子作斗争的力量。屯里又没有党领导，一部分人消极不管，一部分人干着急。有些社员越看越觉有问题，就把情况汇报给党支部。七月间支部派人到西北屯召开了一次社员大会，撤掉了车仁福的生产委员职务。撤换时，由于没有充分发动社员和全屯群众揭露车仁福的破坏行为，以提高社员群众的认识和觉悟，这样虽然撤了车仁福的职务，但并没能阻止他继续进行破坏活动。
    撤职后，车仁福根本不下地参加社的生产了；他利用白天社员组员下地生产的时间，深入到社员家里和互助组员家里继续进行破坏活动。他对副主任孟范有说：“老孟，社里就是咱俩家车马多，他们都是两个肩膀抗个嘴，有啥！”又说：“咱们趟地压两棵苗还得受他们批评（孟范有曾因压苗挨过批评）这叫有功不显，有点错就扣，咱们何必受这份窝囊气！”一来二去说得孟范有也动摇起来了。车仁福在社内活动的结果，十八户社员中有八户动摇打算秋后退社。此外，车仁福还经常到互助组进行破坏活动。他向富裕中农纪春玉讲：“合作社那玩意，对你这样户有什么好处？这话除非你，我不说。”对身体软弱的于庚礼说：“入社像扛大活一样，像你这个身板，进社就得累完蛋，你要想多活二年就别入社，过年咱俩插个小组。”车仁福就这样挨门串户从社内到社外，从富裕户到困难户，见什么人说什么话来破坏合作社，这样使许多社员失掉了办社信心，不少组员打消了入社念头。
    直到一九五四年冬县委工作组到了这个村，一部分贫农和新中农社员把车仁福的破坏行为反映给工作组；工作组经过贫农座谈会、积极分子座谈会，才彻底揭露了车仁福的富农面目和破坏罪行。车仁福在土地改革时是个富裕中农，土改后，他靠组织假互助组、雇长工、放高利贷、贩马偷税等等活动，逐步发展成为富农。他年年都找没车马、劳力多的贫苦户插组，农忙还大量雇短工，直到入社他家有六匹马，四头牛，一台车，二十三、四垧地。因他弟弟是青年团员，车仁福就在这样“进步”的招牌下混入社内多方活动。过去党支部虽曾几次去进行了整顿，撤掉了车仁福的生产委员，但始终没有划清阶级界限；这次，大家才认清了这个阶级敌人的真面孔。
    座谈会上，大家愤怒地一宗一宗数着车仁福的破坏罪行。有许多过去摸不着头脑的事，现在一对照，水落石出。张喜山说：“原来是一只耗子搅得满锅腥。”社员们压不住怒火，向克山县人民法院提起了控诉。富农破坏分子车仁福终于被逮捕法办受到了应得的惩处，全村群众也受到了很大的教育。村支部书记说：“过去好像光听辘辘响，不知井在哪儿？看不清，摸不透，不敢斗，整了几次，药不对症。”副村长说：“过去一到西北屯，就像进了‘迷魂阵’，这才算把盖揭开了。”被车仁福拉拢的孟范有、于庚喜也清醒过来，非常悔恨自己上了车仁福的当，愤怒地揭发了车仁福的卑劣行为。被挑拨不团结的社员也各自作了检讨。八户动摇的社员也说：“这会把病根子去了，我们还出社干啥！”被车仁福谣言蒙蔽的农民们说：“这真是割倒了麻秆露出了狼，使我们的眼睛亮了。”互助组长张永江说：“都走上互助合作道路，车仁福就没法剥削了，共产党把我们解放出来，车仁福又想把我们扔进泥坑里去！”社内外思想澄清了，贫农中农情绪高涨，又有十六户农民加入了这个社。全屯农民都觉得像上了一次大课。
