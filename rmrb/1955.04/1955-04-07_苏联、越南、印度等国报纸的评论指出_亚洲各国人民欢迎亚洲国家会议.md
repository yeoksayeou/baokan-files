Xinhua News Agency, April 6th -- According to TASS, Moscow, April 5th: "Pravda" published an article by A. Sofronov commenting on the Asian Countries Conference opening in Delhi on the 6th.

	He emphasized that this conference is important and timely. He pointed out that aggressive forces continue to plot evil conspiracies to launch another world war. The United States and several other countries are clamoring for the use of atomic weapons. He said, however, that the people of Asian countries are fully determined to defend their national interests and peace from imperialist aggression. Therefore, the proposition of combining the efforts of the people of all countries to strive for peace and closer cooperation among Asian countries is gaining more and more sympathy. International principles promoting friendly cooperation among the people of all countries have been supported in Asia. These principles have already formed the basis of diplomatic relations between countries like the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, India, and several other countries. Adhering to these principles can enable countries with different social and state systems to coexist peacefully. Sofronov concluded by saying that the people of Asian countries are looking forward to the opening of the conference and hope that it will make decisions that will satisfy people of all strata. Millions of men and women believe that the Asian Countries Conference will express their clear opinions and condemn the warmongers who clamor for the use of atomic weapons. Millions of people believe that the Asian Countries Conference will make a significant contribution to easing international tensions.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 6th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 6th, welcoming the convening of the Asian Countries Conference. The editorial said that the Asian Countries Conference will demonstrate the firm determination of the Asian people to defend Asian peace and oppose the war provocation conspiracies of the US imperialists. After describing the achievements of the Asian people's movement for national liberation, the editorial said that the imperialists, headed by the United States, are unwilling to admit their defeat. They are using all kinds of perfidious means to instigate aggressive wars in an attempt to maintain or reimpose the shackles of enslavement on the Asian people. The editorial said that this conference will pay special attention to the implementation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in Asian countries. The editorial said that China and India, the two largest countries in Asia, have been cooperating with each other on an equal footing despite their different political systems. This constitutes an important foundation for consolidating and expanding international cooperation and maintaining peace in Asia and the world.

	The editorial said that the voice of peace to be issued at this conference is in itself a force, because this voice reflects the determination of the Asian people to crush the war provocation plans of the US imperialists.

	The editorial said that the US imperialists believe that they can use their atomic bombs to decide everything. But the strength lies precisely in the unity of the people of all countries and the solidarity among the people of all countries.

	The editorial said that the Asian Countries Conference is a major contribution to world peace. This conference creates a favorable atmosphere for the upcoming Asian-African Conference.

	The editorial said that the Vietnamese people warmly welcome and support the Asian Countries Conference and pledge to fight and make positive contributions to the cause of defending peace in Asia and the world.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 6th: The "Times of India" published an editorial on the 5th commenting on the Asian Countries Conference opening on the 6th, saying that the Asian Countries Conference is a manifestation of a new factor in current international affairs. The Asian Countries Conference will have the broadest scope for exchanging views. It should be emphasized that the spirit in which the conference is convened enables participants to gather together without being constrained or limited by any ideological obligations. There is the possibility that through such informal contacts, a greater desire for peace and international goodwill will be stimulated.

	The editorial said that peace-loving countries are not limited to Asia, and what is currently needed is an example of cooperation among all peace-loving people, regardless of where these peace-loving people live or what ideologies they hold. The editorial pointed out that an encouraging feature of the Asian Countries Conference is that the delegates include people from all walks of life, including industry, art, and science. Previously, conferences were usually limited to politicians. Obviously, now is the time for people with broad representation from all the people to find ways to express their opinions on some of the outstanding issues in Asia and the world.

    苏联、越南、印度等国报纸的评论指出
    亚洲各国人民欢迎亚洲国家会议
    新华社六日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科五日讯：“真理报”刊登了安·索弗罗诺夫写的一篇文章，评论六日在德里开幕的亚洲国家会议。
    他着重指出，这个会议是重要和及时的。他指出，侵略力量继续在策划发动另一次世界大战的罪恶阴谋。美国和若干其他国家正在叫嚷使用原子武器。他说，但是亚洲各国人民有充分的决心维护他们的民族利益和和平不受帝国主义的侵犯。因此，把各国人民争取和平和争取亚洲国家间的密切合作的努力结合起来的主张，正获得越来越多的同情。促进各国人民间的友好合作的国际原则已在亚洲得到了支持。这些原则已经构成了像苏联、中华人民共和国、印度和若干其他国家的外交关系的基础。遵守这些原则就可以使不同社会和国家制度的各国和平共处。索弗罗诺夫最后说，亚洲各国人民正在期待会议的开幕，并且希望这个会议将作出使各个不同阶层的人民都感到满意的决定。千百万男女相信，亚洲国家会议将说出他们的明确的意见，谴责扬言使用原子武器的战争制造者。千百万人民相信，亚洲国家会议将为缓和国际紧张局势作出重大的贡献。新华社河内六日电　越南“人民报”六日发表社论，欢迎亚洲国家会议的召开。社论说，亚洲国家会议将表示出亚洲人民为保卫亚洲和平，反对美帝国主义者的战争挑衅阴谋而进行斗争的坚强决心。社论在叙述了亚洲各国人民争取民族解放的运动的成就后说，以美国为首的帝国主义者不肯承认他们的失败。他们用尽各种背信弃义的手段策动侵略战争，企图保持或是重新把奴役的枷锁加在亚洲人民的身上。社论说，这次会议将特别注意和平共处的五项原则在亚洲国家内的实施。社论说，中国和印度这两个亚洲最大的国家尽管政治制度有所不同，一直是在平等的地位上相互合作。这构成了巩固和扩大国际合作、维护亚洲和世界和平的一个重要的基础。
    社论说，将在这次会议上发出的和平的呼声本身就是一种力量，因为这种呼声反映了亚洲人民粉碎美帝国主义者的战争挑衅计划的决心。
    社论说，美帝国主义者认为他们可以用他们的原子弹来决定一切。但是力量恰好在于各国人民的团结和各国人民之间的团结。
    社论说，亚洲国家会议是对世界和平的一个重大的贡献。这次会议为即将举行的亚非会议创造了一种有利的气氛。
    社论说，越南人民热烈欢迎和支持亚洲国家会议，并且保证进行斗争，为保卫亚洲及世界和平的事业作出积极的贡献。
    新华社新德里六日电　“印度时报”五日发表社论评论六日召开的亚洲国家会议说，亚洲国家会议是目前国际事务中的一种新因素的表现。亚洲国家会议将有最广阔的领域来交换意见。应该强调说明，召开会议的那种精神使得参加会议的人能够丝毫不受任何观念形态的拘束或义务所限制而团聚一堂。有这样的可能性：通过这样一些非正式的接触，将会刺激起更大的要求和平和国际亲善的愿望。
    社论说，爱好和平的国家并不限于在亚洲，而目前所需要的就是在所有爱好和平人民之间进行合作的榜样，不管这些爱好和平的人住在何处，或者他们怀有何种观念形态。社论指出，亚洲国家会议的一个令人鼓舞的特点就是，代表中包括工业、艺术和科学等各阶层的人士。在此以前，会议通常都是限于政治家的，显然，目前正是由广泛代表全体人民的一些人找出一些办法来对亚洲和世界的一些悬而未决的问题表示他们的意见的时候。
