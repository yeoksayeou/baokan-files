The U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek Agents Snatched Away My Dearest Zhaoqi
Mai Shaomei

With boundless grief and indignation, I accuse the bloody crimes of the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek agents to the people of the whole country and the people of the world who uphold justice and love peace. My beloved Li Zhaoqi and the other eleven comrades including staff members and journalists of the Chinese delegation attending the Asian-African Conference, were killed by the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek agents. Under the sinister hands of the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek agents, my dearest Zhaoqi and I are separated forever! I am grieved because Zhaoqi's martyrdom is a loss to the country, and an irreparable loss to me personally. I am indignant, indignant that the enemy would use such despicable and shameless means to deprive Zhaoqi and the other ten comrades of their precious lives, attempting to achieve their goal of undermining the Asian-African Conference.

In the past few days, while anxiously awaiting news about the whereabouts of Zhaoqi and the other comrades, the emotions of grief and indignation painfully tormented me. Sometimes, I felt that I must live on, and live on strongly, in order to complete the work that Zhaoqi had not yet finished; but sometimes I felt lonely, and felt that the courage to live on was disappearing from me. At this time, the Party and the comrades around me extended a warm hand of support to me, and many other comrades gave me tremendous encouragement through their heartfelt condolences in recent days. I began to no longer feel lonely, and began to have the courage to raise my head and recognize that I must live on strongly. If Zhaoqi had a soul, he would definitely want me to do so, so that I can inherit his legacy and continue to carry out a resolute struggle for the cause of peace and justice on the diplomatic front.

Zhaoqi had told me more than once during his lifetime: Life is a struggle, and without struggle, life has no meaning. Looking back on his short thirty-five years of life, this sentence was indeed reflected in his actual actions. He began to fight against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit agents in his university days, and since then, in every stage of his life, he launched unremitting struggles against reactionary forces, until he finally dedicated his precious life.

In this lifetime of struggle, he showed a high degree of responsibility for every task assigned to him by the organization, and completed these tasks without any hesitation. This attendance at the Asian-African Conference is a good example. He deeply understood the arduousness of this task beforehand, and estimated that accidents might happen, so he asked for photos of me and the children to take with him before leaving home. He knew there was danger, but in the face of the struggle against the enemy, he did not flinch in the slightest.

He was hardworking and willing to bear hardships in his work. As long as the work required it, he could sacrifice all his rest time to complete the work. After the Korean War armistice, he returned from Korea, got off the train in the morning, and immediately threw himself into new work in the afternoon, working several consecutive nights with very little rest, but I never heard him complain. He often said to me: Devoting all one's energy to work is only the most basic contribution to the revolution.

Now, he has dedicated his life to the revolution. Judging from his past words and deeds, sacrificing his life at his post was not an unexpected thing for him, and he would definitely not rest in peace if I didn't do so. As long as imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique exist for one day, the struggle must continue for one day. Where there is struggle, there is sacrifice of blood and flesh. It is inconceivable that we can build a socialist society without the sacrifice of blood and flesh. But, if I remain mired in grief for a long time and fail to rouse myself to join the comrades in carrying out unremitting struggles against the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek agents and all international reactionary forces as he did in the past, then he would really not rest in peace. As his closest companion and comrade-in-arms during his lifetime, I must rouse myself, turn grief into strength, learn from his spirit of persevering in the struggle against the enemy throughout his life and his high degree of responsibility for his work, and continue the struggle until the enemy pays off the blood debt for this plane crash—no, until they pay off all blood debts.

    美蒋特务夺去了我最亲爱的肇基
    麦少楣
    我以无比的悲痛和愤恨，向全国以及全世界维护正义和爱好和平的人们控诉美蒋特务的血腥罪行。我的爱人李肇基和其他出席亚非会议的我国代表团工作人员、新闻记者等十一位同志，是被美蒋特务杀死的。在美蒋特务的毒手下，我最亲爱的肇基和我永别了！我悲痛，因为肇基的殉难，对国家是一个损失，对我个人说来，更是一个不可弥补的损失。我愤恨，愤恨敌人竟然以这样卑鄙无耻的手段来剥夺肇基和其他十位同志的宝贵生命，企图以此来达到破坏亚非会议的目的。
    在过去这几天焦急地等待着有关肇基和其他同志下落的消息时，悲愤交加的情绪痛苦地折磨着我。有时，我觉得我要活下去，而且还要坚强地活下去，以完成肇基尚未完成的工作；但有时我感到孤单，觉得活下去的勇气正在我身上消失。这时，党和周围的同志向我亲切地伸出了支援的手，其他许多同志连日通过深切的慰问给了我莫大的鼓舞，我开始不再感到孤单了，并开始有勇气抬起头来，认定我必须坚强地活下去。假如肇基有灵的话，他一定也要我这样做，以便我能继承他的遗志，继续在外交战线上为和平正义的事业进行坚决的斗争。
    肇基生前曾不只一次地对我说过：生活是一场斗争，没有斗争，生活就没有意义。回顾他三十五年短促的一生，他这句话的确在他的实际行动中体现出来了。他在大学时代就开始和蒋贼特务作斗争，自此以后，在他生命的每一阶段，他都和反动势力展开不懈的斗争，直至最后献出自己的宝贵的生命为止。
    在他这一生的斗争中，他对组织交给他的每项任务，都表现了高度负责的精神，毫无畏缩地去完成这些任务。这次出席亚非会议就是一个很好的例子。事先他深深体会到这次任务的艰巨，并估计到可能会发生意外，因此离家之前要了我和孩子的照片带在身上。他知道有危险，但在对敌斗争的面前，他是丝毫也不退缩的。
    对于工作，他是任劳任怨的，只要是工作需要，他可以牺牲他全部的休息时间来把工作完成。朝鲜停战后他从朝鲜归来，上午下火车，下午马上投入新的工作，一连几个通宵，休息的时间非常少，但我从未听过他有任何怨言。他常常对我说：把自己的全部精力投入工作也只不过是对革命的最起码的贡献。
    现在，他把生命献给革命了。从他过去的言行看来，在工作岗位上献出自己的生命，对他并不是一件意外的事，他绝不会因此不瞑目。帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团存在一天，斗争就要继续一天。有斗争就有血肉的牺牲。不能设想，没有血肉的牺牲，我们就能建成社会主义社会。但是，假如我长期陷在悲痛中不振作起来跟同志们一起，同美蒋特务，同一切国际反动势力像他过去那样进行不懈的斗争，那他真的要不瞑目了。作为他生前最亲密的伴侣和战友的我，一定振作起来，化悲痛为力量，学习他终身坚持同敌人斗争和对工作高度负责的精神，继续斗争，直至敌人偿清这次飞机失事的血债——不，偿清一切血债时为止。
