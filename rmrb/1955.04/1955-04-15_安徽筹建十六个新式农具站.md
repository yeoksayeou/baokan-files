Anhui Province plans to establish sixteen new-style animal-powered farm implement stations this year in sixteen counties, including Suixi, Lingbi, Sixian, and Dongliu, selecting areas with good mutual aid and cooperation foundations, flat terrain, and relatively convenient transportation for dry farming. Each station will be equipped with fifteen to forty-two pieces of large-scale new-style animal-powered farm implements, such as double-wheel double-furrow plows, twelve-disc harrows, seeders, rocker-arm harvesters, and three-tine cultivators. The new-style animal-powered farm implements set up in each station can sow approximately 2,000 to 5,000 mu. After these new-style animal-powered farm implement stations are established, they will rent large-scale new-style animal-powered farm implements to farmers for use and be responsible for helping farmers use and repair the new-style animal-powered farm implements. The large-scale new-style seeders owned by each new-style animal-powered farm implement station can sow 50 mu in eight hours, making them convenient to use and sowing evenly; the large-scale harvesters pulled by animal power can harvest more than 50 mu of wheat every eight hours.
    Currently, each station is carrying out various preparatory work for the establishment of the stations. The various farm implements planned to be set up have also begun to be shipped from farm implement factories in the Northeast, Beijing, and other places. Before the end of April, each station will sign lease contracts with local agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams to put them into production.

    安徽筹建十六个新式农具站
    安徽省今年将在濉溪、灵璧、泗县、东流等十六个县中选择互助合作基础好、地势平坦、交通比较方便的旱作物地区，建立十六个新式畜力农具站。每站将配备双轮双铧犁、十二片圆盘耙、播种机、摇臂式收割机、三齿中耕器等大型新式畜力农具十五件到四十二件。每站设置的新式畜力农具，约可播种二千亩到五千亩。这批新式畜力农具站成立以后，将出租大型新式畜力农具给农民使用，并负责帮助农民使用和修理新式畜力农具。各新式畜力农具站拥有的大型新式播种机，八小时就可以播种五十亩，使用方便，播种均匀；用畜力牵引的大型收割机，每八小时可收割小麦五十多亩。
    现在，各站正在进行建站的各项准备工作。计划设置的各种农具，也已开始由东北，北京等地农具工厂起运，四月底以前，各站将同当地农业生产合作社和互助组订立租用合同，投入生产。
