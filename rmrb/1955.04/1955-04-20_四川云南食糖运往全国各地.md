    Sichuan and Yunnan Sugar Transported to All Parts of the Country
    The sugar produced in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces is being shipped to all parts of the country. This year, the planned external transfer of sugar from the two provinces in the second quarter is a total of 9,000 tons. In the first half of April, more than 700 tons of Sichuan sugar have been shipped to key construction sites and ethnic minority areas in Qinghai, Gansu, and Shaanxi provinces. The sugar transferred from Yunnan to Jiangxi, Hubei, and other provinces is all local brown sugar, which is very suitable for rural needs. (Xinhua News Agency)

    四川云南食糖运往全国各地
    四川省和云南省出产的食糖正源源运往全国各地。今年第二季度两省计划外调的食糖共九千吨。四月上半月已运了七百多吨川糖到青海、甘肃、陕西等省重点工程工地和少数民族地区。从云南外调到江西、湖北等省的糖全是土红糖，很适合农村需要。　（新华社）
