Xinhua News Agency, April 13th: The First National Congress of the China Democratic National Construction Association concluded on the afternoon of the 12th, lasting twelve days.

    During the meeting, the delegates listened to Huang Yanpei's opening speech, Zhang Naiqi's work report, and explanations regarding the revision of the association's charter. The delegates also participated in a report meeting organized by the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and listened to the political report made by Chen Yi, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The delegates enthusiastically discussed the above reports and reached a consensus.

    The meeting considered this congress to be victorious and successful. Through this congress, the delegates further clarified the nature and tasks of the China Democratic National Construction Association. The meeting pointed out that the China Democratic National Construction Association is a political party of a united front nature within the Chinese People's Democratic United Front, mainly composed of members of the national bourgeoisie. Although the class stance of the members is different, they must all take the general program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Charter as a unified criterion. The congress stipulated the future working guidelines and tasks of the China Democratic National Construction Association, which is to take the state's general task during the transition period as its own general task, and under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, in accordance with the requirements of the state's general task, unite and educate the Chinese national bourgeoisie to actively accept socialist transformation. To this end, it is necessary to cultivate and improve the members who are industrialists and businessmen in aspects such as patriotism, law-abiding, improving production and management, and accepting socialist transformation, to set an example and become progressive backbones in the industrial and commercial circles, closely connect with the masses in the industrial and commercial circles, assist the government in publicizing and implementing national policies, laws, and decrees, especially the state's policies of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and understand, study, and reflect their opinions and demands, represent their legitimate interests, and oppose all illegal acts that endanger public interests, disrupt social and economic order, and undermine national economic plans. Persist in the struggle against enemies at home and abroad, and strive to build a socialist society.

    The congress conducted repeated discussions with ample time. Sixty-five people spoke at the congress. In their speeches, in addition to expressing agreement with the various reports at the meeting, they also exchanged work experience and exchanged different views on related issues. The delegates expressed that they would lead the industrial and commercial masses they are connected with to actively accept socialist transformation and improve production and management.

    On the last day of the congress, one hundred and fifty-seven people were elected as members of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association.

    The congress adopted the Charter of the China Democratic National Construction Association, the report on the examination of proposals, the resolution on the work report of the General Assembly Committee, and the resolution on the working guidelines and tasks of the China Democratic National Construction Association.

    The congress also passed a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao and a congratulatory telegram to the Chinese People's Liberation Army's coastal defense front troops. When the congratulatory telegram was passed, all the delegates stood up and applauded warmly.

    Finally, Sheng Pihua delivered the closing speech. He said: First of all, please allow me, on behalf of this congress, to express our heartfelt gratitude to the Communist Party of China for its correct leadership and deep concern and sincere assistance during the congress! This congress is the first congress in the history of our China Democratic National Construction Association since its establishment. Because representatives from all over the country gathered together, they had the opportunity to exchange work experiences and exchange different views on relevant issues in group meetings and speeches at the congress, reaching a unified understanding, especially unfolding criticism and self-criticism, and promoting the spirit of democracy, thereby enriching the further content of our meeting and consolidating the unity among comrades. All of our delegates have greater confidence and determination to redouble our efforts to complete the glorious tasks assigned to us by the state. Sheng Pihua finally said: The current international and domestic situation is conducive to our country's socialist construction. However, the aggressive group headed by US imperialism and the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group will not be reconciled to the victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary cause. They are colluding to occupy our country's territory of Taiwan and are carrying out war provocations against the Chinese people, trying to undermine our peaceful socialist construction. All members must, together with the people of the whole country, heighten their vigilance, distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, and with their own practical actions, work hard to unite and educate members of the national bourgeoisie to accept socialist transformation, and strive to liberate Taiwan and safeguard world peace to the end!

    民主建国会全国代表大会闭幕
    规定了工作方针任务并选出新的中央领导机构
    据新华社十三日讯　中国民主建国会第一次全国代表大会历时十二天，已在十二日下午闭幕。
    在会议期间，代表们听了黄炎培的开幕词、章乃器作的工作报告，还听取了关于修改会章的说明。代表们还参加了中国共产党中央统一战线工作部主办的报告会，听了中国共产党中央委员会委员陈毅所作的政治报告。代表们热烈讨论了以上报告，取得了一致的认识。
    会议认为，这次大会是胜利的，成功的。通过这次大会，代表们更进一步明确了中国民主建国会的性质和任务。会议指出，中国民主建国会是中国人民民主统一战线之内的、主要由民族资产阶级分子组成的统一战线性质的政党。会员的阶级立场虽然不同，但是都要以中国人民政治协商会议章程的总纲为统一的准则。大会规定了中国民主建国会今后的工作方针和任务，这就是以国家在过渡时期的总任务为自己的总任务，在中国共产党的领导下，根据国家总任务的要求，团结、教育中国民族资产阶级分子积极接受社会主义改造。为此，就需要培养和提高工商业者会员在爱国守法、改进生产经营、接受社会主义改造等方面，作出榜样，成为工商界中的进步骨干，密切联系工商界群众，协助政府宣传、推行国家的政策、法律、法令，特别是国家对资本主义工商业的利用、限制和改造的政策，并了解、研究、反映他们的意见和要求，代表他们的合法利益，反对危害公共利益、扰乱社会经济秩序、破坏国家经济计划的一切非法行为。坚持对国内外敌人的斗争，为建设社会主义社会而奋斗。
    大会以充分的时间进行了反复的讨论。在大会上先后发言的有六十五人。他们在发言中除了表示同意会上的各项报告以外，还交流了工作经验，交换了对有关问题的不同见解。代表们表示今后要带动所联系的工商界群众，积极接受社会主义改造和改进生产经营。
    大会在最后一天，选出了一百五十七人为中国民主建国会中央委员会委员。
    大会通过了中国民主建国会章程，通过了提案审查报告和关于总会委员会工作报告的决议以及关于中国民主建国会的工作方针和任务的决议。
    大会还通过了向毛主席致敬电和向中国人民解放军海防前线部队的致敬电。在通过致敬电时，全体代表起立热烈鼓掌。
    最后，盛丕华致闭幕词。他说：首先请允许我代表这次大会对正确领导我们的中国共产党在大会期间所给予我们深切的关怀和热诚的帮助，表示我们衷心的感谢！这次大会，是我们中国民主建国会成立以来历史上的第一次大会。由于各地代表的相聚一堂，彼此有机会在小组会和大会的发言中，交流了工作经验，交换了有关问题的不同见解，取得了一致的认识，特别是展开了批评和自我批评，发扬了民主精神，从而充实了我们会议的进一步内容，巩固了同志们之间的团结。我们全体代表有了更大的信心和决心，为完成国家所交给我们的光荣任务而加倍努力。盛丕华最后说：当前国际国内局势，是有利于我们国家的社会主义建设的。但是以美国帝国主义为首的侵略集团和反动的蒋介石卖国集团，对中国人民革命事业的胜利，是不会甘心的。他们正勾结起来侵占我国的领土台湾，并对中国人民进行战争挑衅，想以此破坏我们的和平的社会主义建设事业，全体会员必须和全国人民一道，提高警惕，分清敌我，以自己的实际行动，努力做好团结、教育民族资产阶级分子接受社会主义改造的工作，为解放台湾、为维护世界和平而奋斗到底！
