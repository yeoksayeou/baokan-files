Since the health departments in various regions launched the study of policies towards traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), many provinces, cities, and counties have successively convened TCM representative conferences to improve TCM work, enabling TCM practitioners to show greater concern for the health of the people of the motherland. Some TCM practitioners have re-organized long-shelved TCM books for research. At the TCM representative conference in Jinzhai County, Anhui Province, a revolutionary old base area, TCM practitioners contributed 141 single prescriptions, effective prescriptions, and secret recipes. Tang Lixun, a TCM doctor in Zhijiang County, Hunan Province, voluntarily disclosed the secret recipe for treating "sitting sores" at the county's TCM representative conference, sparking a surge of disclosing secret recipes and exchanging experiences.

Due to the attention and care given to TCM by Party organizations and governments in various regions, and the absorption of TCM practitioners into work, the morale of TCM practitioners has generally been high. After Xu Yongsheng, a TCM practitioner, was appointed as deputy section chief of the Health Section by the Shangrao City People's Government in Jiangxi, TCM practitioners in Shangrao City felt very honored, believing that TCM could only be truly valued under the wise leadership of the great Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Dai Heting, an elderly TCM practitioner in Jingning County, Gansu Province, who is over seventy years old, expressed his determination to strive to study the medical heritage of the motherland and serve socialist construction. Li Boqian, an old TCM doctor in Qidong County, Shandong Province, with more than thirty years of medical practice, actively participated in the work of the clinic in response to the call of the Party and the People's Government, and he expressed that he must wholeheartedly treat patients for the people. In Renqiu County, Hebei Province, 279 doctors (most of whom are TCM practitioners) organized 62 disaster area prevention and treatment teams, went to the disaster areas to provide mobile medical treatment for the vast number of disaster victims, and they also signed health care contracts with agricultural production cooperatives to train health workers for the cooperatives and carry out family hygiene work within the cooperatives. Gao Shuchun, an old TCM doctor in Anci County, Hebei Province, is 66 years old this year, and braved the strong wind at night to go to a village more than ten miles away to see patients and carry out measles prevention and treatment work.

    各地中医更加关怀人民卫生事业
    各地卫生部门自从展开对待中医政策的学习以来，许多省、市、县先后召开了中医代表会议，改进中医工作，使中医更加关怀祖国人民卫生事业。有的中医把已经搁置很久的中医书籍重新整理出来进行研究。在革命老根据地——安徽省金寨县的中医代表会议上，中医们纷纷献出了单方、验方和秘方一百四十一件。湖南省芷江县中医师唐立勋在全县中医代表会议上，自动公开了治疗“坐板疮”的秘方，引起了公开秘方和交流经验的热潮。
    由于各地党组织、政府重视和关怀中医，并吸收中医参加工作，中医情绪普遍高涨。江西上饶市人民政府在吸收中医徐永生担任卫生科副科长后，上饶市中医都感到非常光荣，认为只有在伟大的共产党和毛主席英明的领导下，中医才能够真正受到重视。甘肃静宁县七十多岁的老中医戴和亭表示要努力钻研祖国的医学遗产，为社会主义建设服务。山东齐东县李伯谦是已有三十多年行医历史的老中医，为了响应党和人民政府的号召，积极参加了门诊部工作，他表示一定要全心全意为人民治病。河北任邱县二百七十九个医生（其中大部分是中医）组织了六十二个灾区防治组，到灾区为广大灾民巡回治病，他们还和农业生产合作社订立了保健合同，为社里培养保健员，开展社内的家庭卫生工作。河北安次县老中医高树春，今年已六十六岁了，夜间冒着大风到十里多地的村庄去为病人看病，并进行麻疹防治工作。
