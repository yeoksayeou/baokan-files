Learn from the Czechoslovakian and Bulgarian Volleyball Teams
    Fan Mu
    The Czechoslovakian Army Central House volleyball team and the Bulgarian national men's and women's volleyball mixed team visited China in early and mid-April, respectively. They held friendly matches with Chinese volleyball teams in Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan. The high technical level of the Czechoslovakian and Bulgarian volleyball teams and their calm, tenacious, brave, and resourceful spirit in the games were widely praised by Chinese audiences.
    Volleyball in Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria has developed on the basis of mass sports and enjoys a high reputation internationally. The Czechoslovakian Army Central House volleyball team is one of the best volleyball teams in Czechoslovakia. Since 1950, it has maintained the title of Czechoslovakian volleyball champion team every year. Six of its members, such as coach and captain Jo. Broz, members Ka. Broz, Ya. Fuchik, and Yo. Tesaltsi, have also been awarded the title of National Master of Sports of Czechoslovakia. Most of the players in this team participated in the International Youth Friendship Games held in Bucharest in 1953 and the 12th World University Games held in Budapest in 1954, winning third and second place, respectively. The Bulgarian national men's and women's volleyball mixed team is also a well-known volleyball powerhouse. The men's mixed team includes world-renowned volleyball players such as Bao. Gyudjerov, Pa. Bondarov, To. Simov, and Ji. Zakhariyev. They have participated in more than sixty or seventy international matches. The state has awarded them the title of Meritorious Athlete. In the past World Volleyball Championships, the Bulgarian team has always been among the best. They also won the championship at the 12th World University Games. The women's mixed team is also an excellent team, with eight of the twelve members having won the title of National Master of Sports.
    As the saying goes, "Seeing is believing." The visits and matches of the Czechoslovakian and Bulgarian volleyball teams in China convincingly show why they are ranked among the best volleyball teams in the world.
    The Czechoslovakian volleyball team and the Bulgarian men's and women's volleyball teams each have their own strengths in the basic techniques of volleyball and the application of tactics. For example, the Czech team is good at using "underhand" to save the ball, while the Bulgarian team is good at using both hands to lift the ball in front of the chest; the Czech team is accustomed to using the "pull-apart" tactics, and the spikes are mostly carried out on both sides to reduce the chance of the opponent blocking the ball, while the tactics of the Bulgarian team are varied and unpredictable. The Bulgarian and Czech teams also have many common characteristics and advantages, which are worth learning and studying by our volleyball teams with an open mind.
    The Czechoslovakian and Bulgarian volleyball players have undergone good and comprehensive physical exercises. Therefore, the spiking action of each volleyball player is very powerful. The balls they spike are vertical and hard balls, especially the spikes jumped from behind the far net and the restraining line. If the athletes do not have great strength, strong jumping ability, and flexible wrist movements, it is impossible to reach such a high level of technical skill. The Czechoslovakian and Bulgarian volleyball teams are also good at playing many clever "drop shots" while performing strong spikes. Playing "drop shots" requires athletes to have a clear mind and agile movements, to judge the opponent's intentions in an instant, to find the opponent's weaknesses, and to gently pick the ball over. This offensive method often catches the opponent off guard, thus losing the right to serve and the chance to score. Moreover, the Czechoslovakian and Bulgarian volleyball players are full of energy from beginning to end in any game.
    The reason why Czechoslovakian and Bulgarian volleyball players can win is that on the one hand, their bodies have undergone comprehensive exercises, and on the other hand, each athlete has mastered the basic techniques of volleyball proficiently, and can cooperate closely in the competition to exert the power of the collective. They also have a firm, decisive, and calm will. In a match between the Czechoslovakian team and the Central Institute of Physical Education team in Shanghai, the Czechoslovakian team was in a disadvantageous position in two of the sets. In the first set, the Czechoslovakian team took the lead with 15 to 7. At the beginning of the second set, Huang Heng, Cai Qiao, and Wang Zuhong of the Central Institute of Physical Education team appeared very active, scoring points in succession, leading with 14 to 9, and only one point away from winning. However, the Czechoslovakian team did not lose its belief in striving for victory due to this critical situation, but calmly and carefully strived to win back point by point. As a result, they won the second set with 16 to 14. In the third set, the Central Institute of Physical Education team was still ahead, once reaching 14 to 10, again close to victory, but the Czechoslovakian team still stubbornly organized the attack, and as a result, won six points in a row and won the third set. In a friendly match between the Bulgarian men's mixed team and the Central Institute of Physical Education team in Beijing, after the Bulgarian team lost the second set with 12 to 15, at the beginning of the third set, the Bulgarian team coach resolutely replaced several main players who did not play their usual level, and the newly replaced players were once in an unfavorable situation; however, their persistent fighting spirit finally changed the unfavorable situation and turned defeat into victory. Czechoslovakian, Bulgarian athletes and coaches can show such calmness and perseverance in a crisis, on the one hand, because they have rich on-the-spot competition experience; on the other hand, because they have established a belief in striving for victory in the competition.
    In the matches between the Czechoslovakian, Bulgarian volleyball teams and our volleyball teams, we can see that our country's volleyball movement has a certain foundation, and the technical level has also been significantly improved. For example, our country's men's and women's volleyball teams often found themselves in a passive state in the international competitions they participated in in the past. However, in this friendly match with the Czechoslovakian and Bulgarian volleyball teams, this situation was changed, and the dominant position was gained more than once. Particularly significant are the "August 1st" men's volleyball team of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the men's volleyball team of the Central Institute of Physical Education. They have learned and applied Soviet experience and sometimes play very well. However, even like the "August 1st" and Central Institute of Physical Education volleyball teams, there is still room for improvement in terms of physical condition, technique, tactics, or fighting will. In particular, through this competition with the Czechoslovakian and Bulgarian volleyball teams, we should sum up experience well and strive to reach a higher level. The situation of women's volleyball in our country is roughly the same.
    From the matches between the Czechoslovakian, Bulgarian volleyball teams and our volleyball teams, it is reflected that the refereeing work of our country's volleyball movement also needs to be further improved and enhanced. The quality of refereeing work not only affects the progress of the competition, but also has a great influence on improving the technical level of our country's volleyball movement.
    The visits and friendly matches of the Czechoslovakian and Bulgarian volleyball teams to our country also embody the close unity between the people of China and Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria and the friendly cooperation between athletes. During the short visit, the Czechoslovakian and Bulgarian volleyball teams not only gave a very wonderful performance to nearly 100,000 spectators in our country, but also, in the gaps between the matches, the leaders and athletes of the Czechoslovakian and Bulgarian teams told our athletes in detail the training methods in basic techniques and tactical application, and told our referees about the refereeing experience. In the technical symposium after the competition, suggestions for improvement were put forward to our athletes and referees. This close internationalist spirit has deeply educated our sports workers and athletes.
    The visits of the Czechoslovakian and Bulgarian volleyball teams have further enhanced the history of friendship between our country and the people of Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria. It will inevitably have a great effect on promoting the development and improvement of sports in our country, especially volleyball.

    向捷、保排球队学习
    范牧
    捷克斯洛伐克军队中央之家排球队和保加利亚国家男、女排球混合队分别于四月初和四月中旬来我国访问。并在北京、上海、武汉三地和我国排球队进行了友谊比赛。捷、保排球队的高度技术水平和他们在比赛中所表现的沉着、顽强、勇猛和机智的精神，普遍受到我国观众的赞扬。
    捷克斯洛伐克和保加利亚的排球运动，是在群众性的体育运动的基础上开展起来的，在国际上都享有很高的声誉。捷克斯洛伐克军队中央之家排球队是捷克斯洛伐克最优秀的排球队之一。它从一九五○年开始，每年都保持着捷克斯洛伐克排球冠军队的称号。其中有六个队员，是捷克斯洛伐克国家排球队的队员。像教练兼队长约·布罗齐，队员卡·布罗齐、雅·伏契克、约·捷萨尔齐等还荣获了捷克斯洛伐克国家运动健将的称号。这支球队的绝大部分队员，曾经参加过一九五三年在布加勒斯特举行的国际青年友谊体育比赛，和一九五四年在布达佩斯举行的第十二届世界大学生运动会，获得第三名和第二名的胜利。保加利亚国家男、女排球混合队也是我们闻名已久的排球劲旅。男子混合队中，拥有世界著名的排球选手鲍·格尤杰罗夫、帕·邦达洛夫、托·西莫夫、吉·札哈里耶夫等。他们参加国际比赛达六、七十次以上。国家曾授给他们功勋运动员的称号。在参加历次世界排球锦标赛中，保加利亚队总是名列前茅。在第十二届世界大学生运动会中他们又获得了冠军。女子混合队也是一支出色的队伍，在十二名队员中，就有八人获得国家运动健将的称号。
    俗语说得好，“百闻不如一见”。捷、保排球队在我国的访问和比赛，令人信服地看到他们为什么名列于世界上最优秀的排球队伍之中。
    捷克斯洛伐克排球队和保加利亚男、女排球队，在排球运动的基本技术上和战术的运用上各有所长。如捷队善用“下手”救球，保队则擅长于用双手在胸前把球托起；捷队惯用“拉开”战术，扣球多在两边进行，以减少对方把球封住的机会，保队的战术则变化多端，使人难以捉摸。保、捷两队也有许多共同的特长和优点，值得我国排球队虚心学习和研究。
    捷克斯洛伐克和保加利亚的排球运动员，都经过良好的、全面的身体锻炼。因此，每一个排球运动员的扣杀动作，都是十分有力的。他们所扣的球，都是垂直而下的硬球，尤其是远网和限制线后跳起的扣球，如果不是力量大、弹跳力强和转腕动作灵活的运动员，是不可能达到这样高度的技术水平的。捷、保排球队还善于在进行强硬扣杀的同时，打出很多巧妙的“吊球”。打“吊球”便要求运动员有清醒的头脑和敏捷的动作，在刹那间判断对方的意图，找寻对方弱点，把球轻轻地挑了过去。这种进攻方式，常使对方措手不及，因而失去了发球权和得分的机会。而且，捷、保排球运动员在任何一场比赛中，自始至终都是精力饱满。
    捷、保排球运动员所以能获得优胜，一方面是由于身体经过了全面锻炼，另一方面是由于每一个运动员纯熟地掌握了排球运动的基本技术，在比赛中能紧密配合，发挥集体的力量。他们还具有坚决、果敢、沉着的意志。捷克斯洛伐克队在上海和中央体育学院队的一场比赛中，有两局都曾处于劣势的地位。第一局捷队以十五比七占先。第二局一开始，中央体育学院队黄亨、蔡翘、王祖洪就显得十分活跃，连连得分，以十四比九领先，仅仅差一分就可获得胜利。但是，捷队丝毫没有因这种危急的局面丧失了争取胜利的信念，而是沉着地、认真地一分一分地争取回来。结果反以十六比十四赢得第二局。第三局中央体育学院队还是走在前面，曾经打到十四比十，又接近胜利的边缘，而捷队仍顽强地组织进攻，结果连获六分而胜第三局。保加利亚男子混合队在北京和中央体育学院队的一场友谊赛，保队第二局以十二比十五失利后，第三局开始时，保队教练坚决换下了没有打出常态的几个主要队员，新换上的队员也曾一度处于不利的局面；但是，他们坚持不懈的战斗精神，终于改变了不利的形势，转败为胜。捷、保运动员和教练能在危急的情况下，表现得如此冷静和坚毅，这一方面是由于他们具有丰富的临场比赛经验；另一方面是由于他们树立了在竞赛中争取必胜的信念。
    在捷、保排球队和我国排球队的比赛中，我们可以看到我国排球运动已有了一定的基础，技术水平也有了显著的提高。例如，我国男子排球队和女子排球队，在过去参加过的国际比赛中，往往处于被动状态。而在这次同捷、保排球队的友谊赛中，改变了这种情况，不止一次地取得优势的地位。特别显著的是中国人民解放军的“八一”男子排球队和中央体育学院男子排球队。他们学习并应用了苏联经验，有时打得很出色。但是，即使像“八一”和中央体育学院排球队，无论从身体条件上，技术、战术上或战斗意志上，还有待于改进。特别是通过这次和捷、保排球队的比赛，应该很好地总结经验，争取达到更高的水平。我国女子排球运动的情况，大体上也是如此。
    从捷、保排球队和我国排球队的比赛中，反映出了我国排球运动的裁判工作也须进一步地改进和提高。裁判工作的好坏，不仅影响比赛的进行，而且对于提高我国排球运动的技术水平，也有很大的影响。
    捷克斯洛伐克排球队和保加利亚排球队的来我国访问和友谊比赛，也体现了中国和捷、保两国人民之间的亲密团结和运动员之间的友好合作。在为期不长的访问中间，捷、保排球队不仅给我国近十万观众作了十分精彩的表演，而且在比赛的空隙里，捷、保两队的领导人员和运动员，详尽地告诉给我国运动员在基本技术和战术运用上的训练方法，把裁判经验告诉给我国裁判人员。在比赛后的技术座谈会中，对我国运动员和裁判提出了改进的意见。这种亲密无间的国际主义精神，深深地教育了我国体育工作者和运动员。
    捷、保两国排球队的来访，进一步增进了我国和捷、保两国人民之间的友谊史。它对推动我国体育运动，特别是排球运动的发展和提高，必然会有巨大的作用。
