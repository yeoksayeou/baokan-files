Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 3rd: The French National Peace Congress, which opened on the 2nd in Drancy, a suburb of Paris, closed on the 3rd. Two thousand delegates from all provinces of France and guests from West Germany, Britain, Italy, Belgium and other countries attended the congress.

    The congress was opened by Professor Wagner of the University of Paris. On the afternoon of the 2nd, the congress was divided into various committees to hold separate meetings.

    At the meeting held on the 3rd, Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, delivered a speech. He emphasized that French peace fighters should not be discouraged by the parliament's approval of the Paris Accords. We are not alone. The movement to strive for peace, to ban atomic and hydrogen weapons, to strive for universal disarmament, and to resolve disputes through international consultation has grown stronger in all countries.

    Joliot-Curie condemned the atomic blackmail used by the war instigators and the atomic war preparations of the "Atlantic" strategists. He pointed out the necessity of immediately destroying all existing atomic and hydrogen weapons and banning the manufacture of such weapons. Joliot-Curie then said that those who want to plan an atomic war as a crusade to destroy systems different from their own are greatly mistaken; their own unstable systems, which lack popular support, will collapse due to the material and spiritual difficulties caused by the destruction caused by atomic weapons.

    Joliot-Curie finally called on the French people to respond to the call of the World Peace Council and actively participate in the movement to collect signatures for this appeal against atomic war.

    Representatives of peace fighters from West Germany, Belgium, Algeria and other countries paid tribute to the conference. In his speech, the West German representative emphasized that the French and German people would never give up their struggle for peace and would more strongly resist aggressive plans in Europe.

    The congress passed a general resolution, an open letter to the French people calling on them to participate in the collection of signatures for the World Peace Council's appeal to the people of the world, and a resolution on the German question.

    The open letter to the French people adopted by the congress stated that the French are worried about the revival of the German Wehrmacht with nuclear weapons, and know that once atomic and hydrogen bombs are used, France will inevitably be attacked, so the French people cannot allow a war using such destructive weapons to happen.

    The National Peace Congress solemnly calls on all French people to sign the World Peace Council Standing Committee's appeal to the people of the world against the preparation of atomic war. A widespread signature collection movement should be launched throughout France from today.

    The resolution on the German question, unanimously adopted by the congress, pointed out that the National Assembly's approval of the Paris Accords did not take into account the will of the people who had already striven to veto the "European Defense Community" treaty. The French people cannot agree to the serious consequences of implementing the Paris Accords.

    The resolution said that for four years the French people have thwarted the plan to arm West Germany. Now, they can still prevent the realization of this plan. The French people, whose interests are the same as those of the German people and the people of other European countries, will fight against the implementation of the Paris Accords. France should advocate immediate negotiations between the major powers. This is the demand of the vast majority of French people.

    法国全国和平大会在巴黎郊区德朗西举行
    号召法国人民反对原子战争威胁、阻止武装西德计划的实现
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社巴黎三日讯：法国全国和平大会二日在巴黎郊区德朗西开幕，已于三日闭幕。出席大会的有来自法国一切省份的两千名代表和西德、英国、意大利、比利时等国的来宾。
    大会由巴黎大学教授瓦格纳致开幕词。二日下午，大会分成各个委员会分头举行会议。
    在三日举行的会议上，世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里发表了演说。他强调说，法国的和平战士们不应该因为议会批准巴黎协定而感到气馁。我们并不是孤独的。争取和平、争取禁止原子武器和氢武器、争取普遍裁减军备和通过国际协商来解决争端的运动在一切国家内已日益壮大起来。
    约里奥—居里谴责战争制造者们使用的原子讹诈手段和“大西洋”战略家们的原子战争准备。他指出立即销毁现存的一切原子武器和氢武器和禁止制造这种武器的必要性。约里奥—居里接着说，那些要策划原子战争，作为摧毁同他们自己不同的制度的十字军的人们是大错特错了，他们自己的缺乏人民支持的动摇不稳的制度，将因原子武器造成的破坏所引起的物质和精神上的困难而崩溃。
    约里奥—居里最后号召法国人民响应世界和平理事会的号召，非常积极地参加为这个反对原子战争的呼吁书征集签名的运动。
    西德、比利时、阿尔及利亚和其他国家的和平战士的代表们都向大会致敬。西德代表在他的发言中强调说，法国和德国人民决不会放弃他们争取和平的斗争，并且将更加强烈地抵抗在欧洲的侵略计划。
    大会通过了一项总决议，一项号召法国人民参加为世界和平理事会的告全世界人民书征集签名的告法国人民书和一项关于德国问题的决议。
    大会通过的告法国人民书说，法国人担心拥有核子武器的德国国防军的复活，并且知道一旦原子弹和氢弹被使用，法国将不可避免地会遭到袭击，因此法国人民不能让使用这种毁灭性武器的战争发生。
    全国和平大会庄严地号召全体法国人在世界和平理事会常务委员会发出的反对准备原子战争的告全世界人民书上签名。应该从今天起就在全法国展开广泛的征集签名运动。
    大会一致通过的关于德国问题的决议指出，国民议会批准巴黎协定，没有考虑已经争取否决了“欧洲防务集团”条约的人民的意志。实施巴黎协定的严重后果，法国人民不能同意。
    决议说，四年来法国人民曾使武装西德的计划遭到了失败。现在，他们也还能阻止这种计划的实现。同德国人民以及欧洲其他国家人民利害相同的法国人民将为反对实现巴黎协定而奋斗。法国应该主张立即举行大国谈判。这是绝大多数法国人的要求。
