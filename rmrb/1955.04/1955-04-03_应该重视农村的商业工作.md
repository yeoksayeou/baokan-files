Rural commerce work should be emphasized
Zheng Yuan

The current new situation in rural areas presents county party committees and people's committee leaders with a major issue: strengthening the Party's leadership over rural commerce work. Commerce work plays a decisive role in developing agricultural production and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. This can be seen from the work of unified purchase and sales. In some counties, the unified purchase and sales were completed smoothly, and the peasants further realized the correctness of the Party's policies from concrete facts, and their enthusiasm for production was very high. However, the situation in some counties and districts is different. Only a part of the grain purchase task was completed, the supply work was not done well, and the masses misunderstood the unified purchase as "buying as much as there is," creating a temporary artificial atmosphere of tension, which more or less affected the enthusiasm for production.

This tense atmosphere is concentrated in the grain supply issue in many areas. In many places, farmers have developed the idea of "reporting generously and using sparingly" in the assessment of sales, resulting in a blind expansion of grain sales. Now, it is necessary to further understand the actual working conditions.

According to the preliminary investigation of the rural situation in ten cities and counties by the Liaoning Provincial Grain Bureau, farmers quite generally (including some village cadres) report shortages when they are not short, and report more shortages than they have. Farmers in Sanjiatai Village, District 3, Andong County, said they were short 200,000 jin of grain. After a review, it was proven that a supply of 50,000 jin was enough. Farmers in Gujiazi Village, District 2, Tieling County, reported a shortage of 210,000 jin of grain. After calculating the detailed accounts of each household, it was found that a supply of 110,000 jin would be enough. Farmer Wang Ming in the village has a family of fifteen people, harvested thirty-eight *shi* of grain in 1954, and reported a shortage of five months of food, requesting a supply of 3,375 jin. After calculating the detailed accounts, it was found that only 1,300 jin were missing. In Panjin Farm, villages calculated grain shortages for ten months, with the highest assessed sales reaching 600 jin per person and the lowest 520 jin. This greatly exceeds the supply standard.

We must promptly guarantee the food supply for grain-deficient households. Anyone who ignores this violates the policy. However, to better implement the policy, we must soberly assess the actual situation. For example, in some areas of Liaoning, the grain shortage is not as great as some people report. The origin of this tense atmosphere is that some people misunderstand the Party's policies, and this misunderstanding is caused by the failure of some Party organizations or government departments to correctly implement the Party's policies in rural areas.

Why do many farmers falsely report the amount of grain needed, and how can this problem be solved?

First of all, the deviations in the implementation of the Party's policy of unified purchase and sales in some areas should be corrected. Some comrades did not regard grain purchase work as a matter of the Party's policy towards peasants, but only as a shock task: "Completing the figures is all that matters, the more the better!" During the grain purchase period, they went all out, and after the purchase was completed, they felt that the task was completed and everything was fine. They did not carefully study the difficulties and needs of the masses, "emphasizing purchase and neglecting sales." The grain purchase tasks were completed, but the supply of means of production and livelihood in rural areas did not keep up. In some cities and counties, grain sales targets have not been allocated to households and are still being reviewed and balanced; in some places, supply certificates are not issued to farmers for a long time, and farmers find it difficult and inconvenient to purchase grain, which leads to the misconception that the government "only cares about purchasing and does not care about selling." Under the control of this psychology, some people report more, or even falsely report, the food they need from the state. This deviation in policy implementation must be corrected. The state requires all localities to do a good job in unified purchase and sales at the same time. Unified purchase and sales is a unified and inseparable policy. Those who emphasize purchase and neglect sales and abandon leadership over sales work in actual work violate the policy. The result will create an artificial atmosphere of tension.

Leaving the policy to complete the sales task will also cause adverse consequences. Some places ignore sales in unified purchases, and when they find problems with sales, they do not go deep into understanding the situation, realistically analyze the problems, and solve the problems, but emphasize the difficulties, report them level by level, and ask the state to allocate more grain to meet the "requirements" of the peasants. Some cadres blindly believe the amount of supply falsely reported by a few people and give as much as they want. Some village cadres in Tieling County were afraid that the masses in their villages would not be able to buy grain, so they issued introduction letters to the farmers the night before the supply and marketing cooperative transported the grain, which fueled the farmers' psychology of rushing to buy. Cadres in Jiangtun area, Heishan County, did not strictly control the situation, resulting in a grain rush, and the average daily sales in late February doubled compared with early February. There are also some cadres who ignore the urgent needs of grain-deficient farmers during spring plowing and set overly strict and rigid methods to restrict farmers' grain purchases. The supply and marketing cooperative in Cuijiatun, District 2, Xinjin County, only sells half a month's worth of grain at a time, and the people who sell grain go to work and get off work on time, which is very inconvenient for farmers. In places where these phenomena occur, the county committees have not put the sales work on the agenda, and have not taken appropriate measures to strengthen the supply work, educate cadres on policies, and correct various practices that violate policies and are divorced from the masses. The county party committee must understand the impact of commerce work on farmers and agricultural production from a policy perspective, adhere to the Party's policies in unified purchase and sales, conduct serious policy inspections in the "three fix" work, improve the policy level of cadres, strengthen the Party organization's political work among the masses, and explain the policy to the masses clearly and thoroughly. Experience has proven that when farmers understand the Party's policies, they will definitely tell the truth, and according to the actual situation, they will automatically report less or even not report the amount of supply. To achieve this, it is necessary to resolutely change the current phenomenon that some county committees do not understand the situation and are not familiar with the ideological dynamics of the masses of all strata. The Party organization should have an estimate of the rural supply situation that is close to reality, so that material supply work can be coordinated with political work and progress simultaneously.

Correctly implementing the policy of unified purchase and sales must be carried out from the standpoint of strengthening the country's socialist construction, developing rural production, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. Some cadres do not regard the policy of unified purchase and sales as a part of the Party's general line and general tasks, but as an isolated thing. They believe that the meaning of the word "unified" is "everything is the responsibility of the government," and they do not closely combine the Party's policies with the actual lives of the masses to carry out creative work. The Party organization should unify the requirements of the state with the interests of the peasants within the limits stipulated by the policy, and take various measures suitable to the specific local conditions to implement the policy. Areas with severe disasters or cash crops need to be supplied with grain from above. However, some areas can be completely resolved by the masses themselves through self-regulation. The masses originally had the habit of exchanging grain with each other, and this exchange is completely permissible. Unfortunately, this habit of farmers has been forcibly cancelled in some places. Hao Qingli, a grain-deficient farmer in Batutai Village, Haicheng County, borrowed forty jin of sorghum from relatives, which was designated by the village cadres to be sold to the supply and marketing cooperative. Hao Qingli requested to continue to buy it back, and some village cadres said: "Since the state guarantees the supply, it should not be exchanged casually." This quite common phenomenon is mainly caused by the unclear policy thinking of the county and district leading organs, and the failure to explain the policy clearly to the village cadres. After Liaoning Province completed the grain purchase, most of the rural primary grain markets were not opened in time, and some of them were not active enough. Some cadres felt that opening the rural primary grain market would fuel speculation, so they took a blocking approach. These comrades do not understand that the successful completion of the grain unified purchase and sales task basically crushed grain speculation. After the unified purchase and sales, the state's leadership in the grain market was established, ensuring the rational supply of the masses; at the same time, it is also necessary to correctly lead the rural grain market, organize farmers to adjust grain among themselves, facilitate farmers to exchange what they have for what they need, activate the rural economy, and stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for production. Jianshe Village, Changtu County, originally requested the government to supply 400 *shi* of grain to the whole village. After careful calculation, it was found that there was a lot of surplus grain in the village. If voluntary adjustment could be carried out among the farmers, it would be enough for the government to supply only 100 *shi* of grain. This approach is beneficial to farmers and also beneficial to the country.

The Party's "Three Fixes" policy provides the most powerful weapon for solving the above problems. It unifies the three major tasks of production, purchase, and sales under a policy principle, so that farmers can "touch the bottom" and give farmers the scope to control their own grain, thus greatly encouraging farmers' enthusiasm for production. This is the fundamental reason why the vast number of cadres and peasants warmly support the Party's policies. Now the "Three Fixes" policy is being gradually implemented in rural areas. The Party organization must seize the problems existing in the unified purchase and sales work and solve them correctly in accordance with the principles of the "Three Fixes" policy. The experience of preliminary pilot projects in individual villages in Liaoning Province proves that as long as we correctly use the spirit of the "Three Fixes" policy to solve problems, we will quickly stabilize and promote farmers' enthusiasm for production. This will open up a broad road for increased production and harvest in this year's agricultural production.

    应该重视农村的商业工作
    郑远
    当前农村新的情况向县委和县人民委员会的领导干部提出一个大问题，就是加强党对农村商业工作领导的问题。商业工作对于发展农业生产和巩固工农联盟有着决定性的作用。这可以从统购统销的工作中看出来。有的县统购统销顺利完成，农民从具体事实中进一步体会到党的政策的正确性，生产情绪十分高涨。但是，有的县区却是另外一种情况。购粮任务只完成了一部分，供应工作做得不好，群众把统购误解为“有多少买多少”，造成了一时的人为的紧张空气，或多或少地影响了生产情绪。
    这种紧张空气在不少地区集中表现在粮食供应问题上。很多地方农民在评销中产生了“宽打窄用”的思想，造成粮食销量盲目扩大的现象。现在，须要进一步了解实际工作情况究竟怎样。
    根据辽宁省粮食厅对十个市县农村情况的初步调查，农民对粮食（包括部分村干部）相当普遍存在着不缺报缺，缺少报多的现象。安东县三区三级台村农民说缺粮二十万斤，经过复查，证明供应五万斤就够了。铁岭县二区孤家子村农民报缺粮二十一万斤，经过逐户算细账，供应十一万斤就够用了。该村农民王明，全家十五口人，一九五四年收获三十八石粮食，自报缺五个月口粮，要求供应三千三百七十五斤。经过算细账，发现只缺一千三百斤。盘山农场内各村户按十个月缺粮计算，最高的每人评销量达六百斤，最低的五百二十斤。大大超过供应标准。
    我们必须及时保证供应缺粮户的口粮，谁忽视这一点，谁就违反了政策。但是，为了更好地执行政策，我们必须清醒地估计实际情况。譬如在辽宁某些地区，缺粮的情况并不如部分群众自报的那样多。这种紧张情绪的由来，是因为有些人对党的政策有误解，这种误解是由于某些党组织或政府部门没有正确执行党在农村的政策所造成的。
    为什么有很多农民虚报需粮数量，怎样解决这一问题呢？
    首先，应当纠正某些地区在执行党的统购统销政策方面产生的偏差。有些同志没有把购粮工作看做是党对农民的政策问题，而仅仅看做是一个突击任务：“完成数字，就算了，多一点更好！”在购粮期间，是全力以赴，购完以后，就觉得任务完成万事大吉了。他们没有认真地研究群众的困难和需要，“重购轻销”，购粮任务完成了，但农村生产资料和生活资料的供应工作却没有跟上去。有些市、县的粮食销售指标没有分配到户，还在复查平衡；有些地方迟迟不给农民发供应证，农民购粮感到困难和不方便，以致发生了错觉，以为是政府“只管购不顾销”。在这种心理支配下，有些人就多报、甚至虚报自己需要国家供应的口粮。这种执行政策的偏差必须纠正。国家要求各地把统购和统销工作同时做好。统购统销是统一而不可分的政策。那种在实际工作中重购轻销，放弃对销售工作的领导，都是违反政策的。它的结果就会制造人为的紧张情绪。
    离开了政策完成统销任务，同样会造成不良的后果。有些地方在统购中忽视统销，及至发现统销有了问题，又不去深入了解情况，切实地分析问题解决问题，而是强调困难，逐级上报，要求国家多调拨粮食满足农民的“要求”，有的干部竟盲目听信少数人虚报的供应量，要多少给多少。铁岭县有些村干部怕本村群众买不到粮食，在供销合作社运到粮食的头天晚上，就给农民乱开介绍信，助长了农民争先抢购的心理。黑山县姜屯地区干部掌握不严，造成粮食抢购现象，二月下旬每天的销售量平均比上旬增加一倍。也有一些干部，忽视缺粮农民在春耕期间的迫切需要，定出过严和过死的办法来限制农民购粮。新金县二区崔家屯供销社每次只卖半个月的粮，卖粮的人按时上班下班，农民感到极不方便。发生这些现象的地方，县委会都没有把统销工作提到议事日程上来，没有采取适当措施，加强供应工作，从政策上教育干部纠正各种违反政策、脱离群众的做法。县委必须从政策上认识商业工作对农民和农业生产的影响，在统购统销中坚持贯彻党的政策，在“三定”工作中认真进行政策检查，提高干部的政策水平，加强党组织在群众中的政治工作，把政策向群众讲清说透。经验证明：农民懂得了党的政策，一定会说真心话，按照实际情况，自动少报甚至不报供应量。为了做到这一点，必须坚决改变目前某些县委不了解下情，不熟悉各阶层群众思想动态的现象。党的组织对于农村供应情况应当有一个接近实际的估计，这就可以把物质供应工作，同政治工作配合起来，同时并进。
    正确执行统购统销政策，必须从加强国家的社会主义建设，发展农村生产，巩固工农联盟的观点出发来进行工作。有些干部没有把统购统销政策看成是党的总路线总任务的一个部分，而是把它看作是一个孤立的东西。他们认为“统”字的意思就是“什么也是由政府负责”，而没有把党的政策同群众实际生活密切结合起来，进行创造性的工作。党组织应当在政策规定的界限内，把国家要求同农民利益统一起来，采取各种适合当地具体条件的措施，来贯彻执行政策。灾情严重或经济作物地区，是需要从上边供应粮食的。但有些地区却完全可以由群众自行调剂解决。群众原有互相串换粮食的习惯，这种串换完全是可以允许的。可惜，农民这种习惯却在某些地方被强制取消了。海城县八土台屯缺粮农民郝庆立在亲戚家借的四十斤高粱，被村干部指定卖给供销社。郝庆立要求继续买回，有的村干部说：“国家既然保证供应，就不应该随便串换。”这种相当普遍的现象，主要是县区领导机关的政策思想不明确，没有向村干部交代清楚政策造成的。辽宁省购粮完成后，大部分农村粮食初级市场没有及时开放，有的开放了，也不够活跃。有些干部觉得开放农村粮食初级市场会助长投机活动，因而采取了封锁的办法。这些同志不了解，很好地完成粮食统购统销任务，这就基本上粉碎了粮食投机行为。经过统购统销，确立了国家在粮食市场的领导权，保证了群众的合理供应；同时还要正确地领导农村粮食市场，组织农民相互之间调剂粮食，便利农民互通有无，活跃农村经济，刺激农民生产积极性。昌图县建设村全村原来要求政府供应四百石粮食，经过仔细算账后，发现本村余粮很多，如能在农民中间进行自愿的调剂，只要政府供应一百石粮食就够了。这个作法对农民有好处，对国家也有利益。
    党的“三定”政策给解决上述问题提供了最有力的武器。它把产、购、销三件大事统一在一个政策原则之下，使农民摸了“底”，给农民以支配自己粮食的机动范围，因而极大地鼓舞了农民的生产积极性。这就是广大干部和农民热烈拥护党的政策的基本原因。现在“三定”政策正向农村逐步贯彻，党的组织必须抓住统购统销工作中存在的问题，按照“三定”政策的原则加以正确的解决。辽宁省个别村庄初步试点的经验证明：只要我们正确运用“三定”政策精神来解决问题，便会很快地稳定并推动农民的生产积极性。这将给今年农业生产开辟一个增产丰收的宽广大道。
