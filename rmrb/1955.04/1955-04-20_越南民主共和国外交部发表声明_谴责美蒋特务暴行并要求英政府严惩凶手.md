Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 19th: The Vietnam News Agency reports that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 18th regarding the murder of personnel from the delegations of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attending the Asian-African Conference, as well as Chinese, Polish, and Austrian journalists, by American-Chiang Kai-shek agents.

The statement said that the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly condemn the barbarous acts of the American-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang before world public opinion, and demand that the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong investigate this plane incident and severely punish the culprits who participated in this crime.

The statement said: This murder incident shows that the American-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has not abandoned their cowardly acts of sabotaging peace and the Asian-African Conference, because they are afraid that this conference will expose and oppose their conspiracies of aggression and war provocation.

The statement pointed out that this inhuman behavior of the American-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has aroused unparalleled anger among the people of Vietnam, China, Poland, Austria, India, and other countries in the world.

The statement said that the barbarous acts of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang clearly show the people of Asia, Africa, and the world that the American imperialists are the enemies of peace. This behavior will not prevent the Asian-African Conference from proceeding according to its original plan. This behavior further heightened the vigilance of the Vietnamese people, who are strengthening their struggle to support the Asian-African Conference and hope for its success.
