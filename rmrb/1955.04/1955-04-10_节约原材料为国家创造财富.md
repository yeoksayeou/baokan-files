Adopting Parallel Mining and Filling Method
The engineering and technical personnel of the Fuxin Coal Mine have collectively created a new mining method that involves parallel operations for coal mining and water-sand filling. Workers call it the "fill-while-mining method." According to technical appraisals conducted over several months, this new mining method can save at least half of the mining sites and mechanical equipment compared to the old method. If combined with the use of a combined coal mining machine, the coal extracted can be more than doubled compared to the old method of drilling and blasting, efficiency can be improved by one-third, and the consumption of gunpowder and detonators can be reduced by three-quarters.

In the past, at the Fuxin Coal Mine, coal mining and filling could not be carried out simultaneously at the same water-sand filling mining site. Because water and sand would splash everywhere during filling, coal miners had to move to another site to mine coal, giving way to the filling workers to fill the site with water and sand. Therefore, a water-sand filling coal mining team often needed two to three mining sites and two to three sets of mechanical equipment, which hindered the improvement of labor efficiency and the effectiveness of mechanical equipment. In August 1954, simultaneously with the successful trial use of a combined coal mining machine at the water-sand filling site of the Gao De Mine's West Eighth Pit, the engineering and technical personnel of the Fuxin Coal Mine collectively researched a method of adding several water and sand barriers at the mining site, with water and sand being filled on one side of the barriers and coal mining continuing on the other side, allowing the two tasks to be carried out simultaneously at one site. In this way, many idle mining sites and mechanical equipment could be utilized to the fullest extent.

The technical负责人 [fùzé rén - person in charge] of the Fuxin Mining Bureau believes that this creation is of great significance for further promoting the water-sand filling mining method in the Fuxin Coal Mine. In 1955, they plan to widely promote this experience in water-sand filling mines that have the necessary conditions. (Xinhua News Agency)

Saving Over One Hundred Bundles of Yarn in Half a Month
The Second Workshop of the Qingdao Shiye Cotton Weaving Factory saved more than 120 bundles of cotton yarn in the first half of March.

At the end of February and the beginning of March, when the workshop was discussing the state plan, the leadership, addressing the issue of cotton yarn waste, educated the workers using detailed accounting methods, explaining the importance of saving cotton yarn, and conducted group discussions.

At the same time, specific requirements were also put forward to the workers: the yarn tail should not exceed one foot for each shuttle change; the amount of cloth unraveling should not exceed one inch per machine per shift, and if more than twelve inches of defective cloth are woven, unraveling is no longer allowed. In addition, the weights were also appropriately adjusted to ensure even tension of the warp yarns, which played a certain role in saving cotton yarn. Thanks to the efforts of all the workers, the workshop can now save 0.1562 pounds of cotton yarn per bolt of cloth compared to the quota. The cotton yarn saved in the first half of March can weave 98 bolts of khaki fabric, enough to make more than 690 suits of clothes.

Producing Over One Hundred Tons of Rice
The locally state-owned Changchun Rice Mill completed the first quarter's state plan two days ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota. The rice output rate of various processed grains exceeded the state target, with rice exceeding the target by 2.76 percent and millet exceeding the target by 1.48 percent, resulting in an additional 161 tons of grain for the state.

To exceed the first quarter's plan, the staff and workers of the Changchun Rice Mill put forward more than 100 rationalization proposals to improve technology and production, one of which increased the millet output rate from 77.82 percent to 78.86 percent. On the basis of promoting the Soviet expert's suggestion of "separate-grain processing," the Dou Ruixiang team in the Third Workshop created an operational method of "frequent separation, frequent consolidation of bran, and frequent inspection," which solved the problem of the output rate being affected by the poor quality of raw materials.

Saving Over Fifty Thousand Jin of Tobacco Leaves in Four Months
Since November of last year, the staff and workers of the Taiyuan Tobacco Factory have launched a labor competition focusing on strengthening technical management and improving technical levels. During the competition, everyone actively improved artificial fermentation, moisturizing, and insulation work, improved the quality of stem removal, and implemented the "quota-based material requisition" system, thus effectively reducing the consumption of tobacco leaves in various processes. In the past four months, a total of 54,856 jin of tobacco leaves have been saved.

Using Wastewater Can Save 60,000 Yuan a Year
The staff and workers of the water supply section of the Anshan Iron and Steel's Large Rolling Mill found ways to increase production and save money during discussions on the state plan. They connected the cooling water from the main electrical room to the hot saw and rolling mill for reuse. The water pressure is the same as before, and it does not affect production at all. In the past, this water would flow away along the ditch after being used in the main electrical room. The main electrical room's return water pipe is eight inches thick and can flow 190,000 tons of water per year. Now, by utilizing this water that was being thrown away, 60,000 yuan can be saved for the country each year.

Using Reinforced Concrete Supports to Save Pit Props
The underground ventilation area of the Kailuan Tangshan Mine has successfully trialed the use of prefabricated reinforced concrete supports to replace wooden supports. Currently, based on the experience gained, the Tangshan Mine is preparing to use reinforced concrete supports on a large scale in ventilation ducts and chutes that have been in use for more than two years.

After learning the experience of using reinforced concrete supports to replace wooden supports from the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau in June 1954, the Tangshan Mine began testing them in the 8820 working face ventilation duct. The results proved that its compressive resistance can exceed that of wooden supports by more than four times. In coal mine ducts and chutes, wooden supports need to be repaired and replaced every six months, while reinforced concrete supports can be used for ten to fifteen years in ventilation ducts with less pressure. Therefore, the use of reinforced concrete supports can save a large amount of pit props and reduce coal mining costs.

    节约原材料为国家创造财富
    采煤和充填平行作业法
    阜新煤矿工程技术人员集体创造了一种采煤和水砂充填平行作业的新采煤方法。工人们叫它“边充边采法”。根据几个月来的技术鉴定，这种新的采煤方法比起老的方法来，采煤场子和机械设备至少可以节省一半以上。如果再使用联合采煤机，所采的煤还可以比用打眼放炮的老方法所采的煤增加一倍以上，效率可提高三分之一，火药和雷管也可以少消耗四分之三。
    阜新煤矿过去在同一个水砂充填的采煤场子上，采煤和充填两种工作不能同时进行。因为充填时水砂四溅，采煤工人不得不搬到另一个场子去采煤，好让出这个场子来给充填工人充填水砂。因此，一个水砂充填采煤队，常常需要有两个到三个采煤场子和两套到三套机械设备，这就阻碍了劳动效率和机械设备效能的发挥。一九五四年八月，和高德矿西八坑水砂充填场子试用联合采煤机成功的同时，阜新煤矿工程技术人员集体研究出在采煤场子上增设几道挡水和挡砂门的办法，门的一边充填水砂，门的另一边继续采煤，使两种工作可以同时在一个场子上进行。这样，许多闲置的采煤场子和机械设备就可以尽量发挥作用。
    阜新矿务局技术负责人认为：这一创造，对阜新煤矿进一步推行水砂充填采煤法有很大意义。一九五五年，他们准备在有条件的水砂充填矿井里普遍推行这一经验。　（新华社）
    半个月节约一百多捆纱
    青岛实业棉织厂第二车间，三月上半月节约棉纱一百二十多捆。
    二月底、三月初，这车间在讨论国家计划时，领导上针对浪费棉纱问题，用算细账的方法向工人进行教育，说明节约棉纱的重要意义，并分组进行了座谈。
    同时还向工人提出了具体要求：每换一个梭，纱尾巴不得超过一呎；拆布每台机每班不得超过一吋，如果织残布超过十二吋就不许再拆。除此以外也适当地调整了重锤，使经纱张力均匀，对节约棉纱起了一定的作用。经过全体工人的努力，这车间现在每织一匹布就能比定额节约棉纱零点一五六二磅。三月上半月所节约的棉纱，可织卡叽布九十八匹，够做六百九十多套衣服。
      多出一百多吨米
    地方国营长春制米厂提前两天超额完成了第一季度国家计划。各种加工粮谷出米率都超过了国家指标，稻子超过指标百分之二点七六，谷子超过指标百分之一点四八，共为国家多出粮食一百六十一吨。
    长春制米厂职工为超额完成第一季度计划，共提出提高技术、改进生产的合理化建议一百多件，其中一项就使谷子出品率由过去的百分之七十七点八二提高到百分之七十八点八六。在推广苏联专家建议“分粒加工”的基础上，三车间窦瑞祥小组创造了“勤分粒、勤统糠、勤检查”的作业法，解决了因原料质量不好影响出品率的问题。

      四个月节约烟叶五万多斤
    太原烟草厂职工，从去年十一月份起，开展了以加强技术管理和提高技术水平为主要内容的劳动竞赛。在竞赛中，由于大家积极改进了人工发酵和保湿、保温工作，并提高了抽梗工作的质量，贯彻了“限额领料”制度，因而在各个工序中有效地减少了烟叶的耗损。四个月来，共节约了烟叶五万四千八百五十六斤。利用废水一年可节约六万元
    鞍钢大型轧钢厂给水工段职工在讨论国家计划中，找到了增产节约办法，把主电室冷却水接到热锯和轧钢机上再使用，水的压力和过去一样，对生产一点也不影响。以前这些水在主电室用了后，就顺着水沟流走了。主电室回水管是八寸粗的管子，一年可流十九万吨水。现在利用了这些白扔的水，一年可给国家节约六万元。用钢筋混凝土支架节约坑木
    开滦唐山矿井下通风区，试用装配式钢筋混凝土支架代替木棚成功。目前唐山矿根据已经取得的经验，正准备在使用二年以上的通风道和顺槽大量使用钢筋混凝土支架。
    唐山矿一九五四年六月从焦作矿务局学习了用钢筋混凝土支架代替木棚的经验后，就开始在八八二○掌通风道试验。结果证明：它的抗压能力可超过木棚四倍以上。在煤矿的风道和顺槽，用木棚每六个月就得修换一次，而使用钢筋混凝土支架，在压力较小的风道将可使用十年到十五年。因此，使用钢筋混凝土支架，可以节省大量坑木，降低采煤成本。
