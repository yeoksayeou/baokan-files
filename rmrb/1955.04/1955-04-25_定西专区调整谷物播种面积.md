Dingxi Special District in Gansu Province, based on the natural laws of arid regions, will adjust the planting area of various grains by more than 400,000 mu.

Most areas of Dingxi suffer from severe drought in spring and summer, with more rainfall in autumn. Therefore, summer crops in these areas often suffer from drought and yields are very low; autumn crops have higher and more stable yields. After investigation and research by the Party and government organs of the special district, it was determined that appropriately adjusting the planting area of summer and autumn crops is the main link for increasing grain production in these areas. Yuzhong, Huining, Dingxi, Jingyuan, Weiyuan, and Huichuan counties, adhering to the spirit of compressing the planting area of low-yielding summer crops, expanding the planting area of high-yielding autumn crops, and reducing fallow land, will adjust the grain planting area by more than 400,000 mu, accounting for about 5% of the total cultivated land area of these six counties.

After this adjustment, with an increase of 100 jin of grain per mu, the six counties will increase the production of 40 million jin of raw grain. With 500 jin of grain per person per year, this is enough for 80,000 people for one year. At the same time, due to less planting of peas and broad beans and more planting of millet and foxtail millet, a large amount of firewood and grass can be produced, solving the difficulties of fuel and fodder for livestock.

Currently, the farmers in Dingxi Special District are planting according to the adjustment plan. Planting in the plains has basically been completed, and planting in the mountainous areas is beginning. The enthusiasm of the masses is generally high.

    定西专区调整谷物播种面积
    甘肃定西专区根据干旱地区自然规律，将调整各种谷物播种面积四十万多亩。
    定西大部地区春夏严重缺雨，秋季雨量较多。因此，这类地区夏季作物常常受旱，产量很低；秋季作物产量较高，且较稳定。经过专区党、政机关调查研究，根据当地情况，确定适当调整夏秋作物的种植面积，是这类地区增产粮食的主要环节。榆中、会宁、定西、靖远、渭源、会川等六个县，本着压缩夏田低产作物、扩大秋田高产作物及减少轮歇地的精神，将调整谷物播种面积四十万多亩，占这六个县总耕地面积的百分之五左右。
    经这样调整后，每亩以增产粮食一百斤计，六个县将增产原粮四千多万斤。每人每年食粮以五百斤计，够八万人一年的食粮。同时，由于少种豌豆、扁豆、多种糜、谷，还可增产大量柴草，解决燃料和牲口饲草困难。
    现在，定西专区农民正按照调整计划播种，川地已基本播种完毕，山区正在开始，群众情绪普遍高涨。
