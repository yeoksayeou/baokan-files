Xinglong Village Becomes Active
Li Baichao

South of Jinan City, nestled in the mountains, lies a village – Xinglong Village in the Sixth District of Licheng County. Around the time of the spring equinox, the area around this mountain village was still quite quiet. Some farmers, unsure about the amount of grain to be purchased and sold by the state this year, were not yet actively raking fields, hoeing wheat, accumulating manure, or delivering fertilizer.

After the news of "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" of grain arrived, the atmosphere in the village immediately became lively. One person said, "This means the state has a clear plan, and the people have a clear idea!" Another said, "This method is truly reasonable. To support national construction and improve our own lives, we must work harder!" The Tenth Agricultural Production Cooperative of Xinglong Township revised its original production plan, increasing the yield of millet and sweet potatoes by 40 jin per mu, and the yield of wheat and beans by 10 jin. They also planned to buy one cow, one donkey, and five pigs. In addition to accumulating more fertilizer and planting more oil crops, the First Agricultural Production Cooperative also plans to plant more than 10,000 trees in the spring, cultivate seedlings on more than one mu, and buy three sows. They have already built five dams, and the work of delivering fertilizer, raking the fields, and working on small mountain plots is also nearing completion. The Dong Zhenliang mutual aid team jointly bought a cow. They originally planned not to hoe the wheat fields or rake the spring fields, but now they plan to hoe the wheat fields three times, rake the spring fields twice, and work hard to accumulate fertilizer. Sun Guangchen, a member of the mutual aid team, revised his production plan and decided to increase planting by half a mu of cotton and two mu of beans to meet the needs of the state. He also diverted the fertilizer originally intended for the millet fields to the four mu of wheat fields and is now actively composting and accumulating fertilizer, planning to replenish the fertilizer used in the millet fields. Individual farmers such as Cheng Dianyu have also re-arranged their family's production and life, planning to apply more fertilizer, hoe the fields diligently, and strive to increase production.

These days, when you climb the hillside and look around the fields surrounding Xinglong Village, you will see donkeys carrying manure on the roads, people raking the fields, people hoeing wheat in the fields, and people planting trees on the mountains… All of this constitutes a busy and joyful picture of spring plowing.

    兴隆村活跃起来了
    李白超
    济南城南，在群山怀抱中有个村庄——历城县第六区的兴隆村。在接近春分的时节，这个山村的周围还相当沉静。有些农民因为对于今年统购和统销粮食的数量不摸底，还没有积极地去耙地、锄麦、积肥、送粪。
    实行粮食“定产、定购、定销”的消息传来以后，村里的空气马上活跃起来。这个说：“这才是国家心中有数，群众心里有底了！”那个说：“这个办法真合理。为了支援国家建设，为了改善自己的生活，我们要加劲干啊！”兴隆乡第十农业生产合作社修改了原来的生产计划，将谷子和地瓜每亩的产量提高四十斤，小麦和豆子的产量提高十斤。另外还计划买一头牛，一头驴和五口猪。第一农业生产合作社除了要多积肥，多种些油料作物以外，还准备在春季植树一万多棵，育苗一亩多，买母猪三头。现在他们已经垒好了五条堰，送粪、耙地和山坡小地的加工工作也快要结束了。董振亮互助组伙买了一头牛。他们原来打算麦田不锄，春地不耙，现在计划麦田锄三遍，春地耙两次，并且要努力积肥。互助组组员孙广宸修订了自己的生产计划，为了适应国家的需要，决定增种半亩棉花、二亩豆子。他还把原来准备用在谷地里的肥料追施到四亩麦地里，现在正积极沤粪积肥，打算把谷地里用的肥料补出来。单干农民程殿玉等也对全家的生产和生活重新作了安排，打算多施肥料，勤锄地，争取增加生产。
    这些日子，当你爬上山坡，环顾兴隆村周围的田野的时候，你就会看到，路上有驴在驮粪，田里有人在耙地，地里有人在锄麦，山上有人在栽树……这一切，构成了一幅繁忙而又欢乐的春耕图。
