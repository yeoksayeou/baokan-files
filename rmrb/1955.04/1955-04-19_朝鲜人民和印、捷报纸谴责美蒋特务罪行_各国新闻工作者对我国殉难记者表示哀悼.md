Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, reported: People from all walks of life in Pyongyang are angrily protesting the crime of US-Chiang Kai-shek agents murdering members and journalists of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference. Hong Jiyang (transliteration), a worker at the Pyongyang Textile Factory, said that the mastermind behind this incident was US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The imperialists are single-mindedly trying to sabotage the Asian-African Conference, and they are attempting to achieve their shameless goals through assassination. He said that through this incident, the enemy's vicious conspiracy has been more clearly exposed. Chi Zhongyi (transliteration), a farmer in the suburbs of Pyongyang, said that this murder incident shows that the dying imperialists are engaging in despicable conspiracies everywhere. Through this incident, we have learned this lesson: we must further increase our vigilance to prevent the enemy's conspiracies.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, reported: Indian newspapers condemned the crime of US-Chiang Kai-shek agents murdering members and journalists of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference.

The "New Age" weekly commented on the 17th: "The spokesmen of the US government and the imperialist newspapers have not stopped their calls against the Bandung Conference, because they recognize that the countries that will meet in Bandung will say 'no' to the American colonial plans in Asia." The commentary said: "Even the fact that it has stooped to the point of destroying airplanes—and in this airplane the passengers are undoubtedly unable to escape—does not shock those who have seen the United States use dagger diplomacy in Iran, Guatemala, Pakistan, and Kashmir. The 'Kashmir Princess' incident is another chapter of this dagger diplomacy—this chapter more clearly shows the extent of the threat of US imperialism to freedom, peace, and democracy."

The "Blitz" weekly emphasized in its editorial on the 16th the need for an absolutely fair and thorough investigation into the cause of the incident. The editorial called for full sanctions against the murderers. The editorial also said, "We hope that the Bandung Conference will take the strictest security measures to guard against more serious sabotage by the enemies of peace in Asia and Africa."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, reported: The Czechoslovak "Red Right Newspaper" published a commentary on the 17th, saying that Asian public opinion "considers the sabotage action of the US and Chiang Kai-shek agents as another proof of hostility towards the People's Republic of China and a shameless attempt to intimidate the participating countries of the Bandung Conference." This criminal act has made the peace-loving people of all countries more clearly aware of the beastly face of the imperialists.

The Slovak "Truth Newspaper" published a commentary on the 16th, saying that the evil conspiracy of the imperialist enslavers can only further strengthen the vigilance and determination of the Asian and African people who have already resolved to firmly grasp their destiny in their own hands.

Xinhua News Agency, 17th: News workers from many countries have sent telegrams to Chinese news workers, expressing their condolences and indignation for the martyrdom of Chinese journalists who went to Bandung to cover the Asian-African Conference due to the assassination by US-Chiang Kai-shek agents.

The telegrams came from: Huang Jun, Director of the Vietnam News Agency; F. Nechaseck, Director of the Czechoslovak Broadcasting Corporation; Mei Apostol, Director of the Romanian Radio and Television Administration; Hess, Chairman of the State Broadcasting Committee of the German Democratic Republic; the Council of the Polish Journalists Association; Suleiman, one of the chairmen of the Presidium of the Indonesian Journalists Association; the editorial department of the Polish "People's Forum Newspaper"; the editorial and administrative departments of the Italian "Unity Newspaper"; and Polish journalists Arski, Boguski, Bronialek, Nowman, Norotonski, Reszonski, Osmanczyk, Wirflowa, and Zulawski, among others.  Reuters Far East correspondent Logan also sent a telegram from Hong Kong expressing condolences.

    朝鲜人民和印、捷报纸谴责美蒋特务罪行
    各国新闻工作者对我国殉难记者表示哀悼
    据新华社平壤电　平壤各界人民愤怒抗议美蒋特务谋杀中国出席亚非会议代表团人员和记者的罪行。平壤纺织工厂工人洪基扬（译音）说，这个事件的主谋是美帝国主义者和蒋介石匪帮。帝国主义者一心想破坏亚非会议，他们企图用暗杀的手段来达到他们的无耻的目的。他说，通过这个事件，敌人的恶毒阴谋更加清楚地暴露出来了。平壤郊区农民池忠义（译音）说，这一谋杀事件说明，垂死的帝国主义者正在各个地方卑鄙地进行阴谋。通过这一事件，我们得出这样的教训：必须要进一步提高我们的警惕性，防止敌人的阴谋活动。
    据新华社新德里电　印度报纸谴责美蒋特务谋杀出席亚非会议的中国代表团人员和记者的罪行。
    十七日的“新世纪”周报评论说：“美国政府发言人和帝国主义的报纸一直没有停止他们反对万隆会议的喊叫，因为他们认识到，将在万隆开会的国家将对美国在亚洲的殖民主义计划说‘不’。”评论说：“甚至于它已卑鄙到破坏飞机——而在这个飞机里的乘客无疑是无法逃生的——地步的这一事实，在那些在伊朗、在危地马拉、在巴基斯坦、在克什米尔见过美国运用匕首外交的人们也并不感到震惊。‘克什米尔公主号’事件是这种匕首外交的另一个章节——这一章节更清楚地表明了美帝国主义对自由、和平和民主的威胁到了什么程度。”
      “闪电”周报在十六日的社论中强调有必要对肇事原因进行绝对公正和彻底的调查。社论要求对谋杀凶手予以充分的制裁。社论又说，“我们希望万隆会议将采取最严密的安全措施，提防亚洲和非洲和平的敌人进行更严重的破坏。”
    据新华社布拉格电　捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”十七日发表评论说，亚洲公众“认为美国和蒋介石特务的破坏行动是敌视中华人民共和国的又一个证明和恫吓万隆会议的与会国的无耻的尝试”。这种犯罪行为使爱好和平的各国人民更清楚地认识了帝国主义者的野兽面貌。
    斯洛伐克“真理报”十六日发表评论说，帝国主义奴役者的罪恶阴谋，只能进一步加强已经决心要把他们的命运牢牢掌握在自己手中的亚洲和非洲人民的警惕和决心。
    新华社十七日讯　许多国家的新闻工作者致电中国新闻工作者，对于前往万隆采访亚非会议新闻的中国记者由于美蒋特务的暗害而殉难表示哀悼和愤慨。
    来电的有，越南通讯社社长黄俊、捷克斯洛伐克广播总局局长弗·内查塞克、罗马尼亚广播总管理局局长梅·阿波斯托尔、德意志民主共和国国家广播事业委员会主席赫斯，波兰新闻工作者协会理事会、印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会主席团主席之一苏莱曼、波兰“人民论坛报”编辑部、意大利“团结报”的编辑部和行政部，以及波兰新闻工作者阿尔斯基、波古斯基、布罗尼亚列克、诺夫曼、诺罗顿斯基、热松斯基、奥斯曼契克、维尔夫洛瓦和祖拉夫斯基等。法新社远东特派记者洛干也从香港来电表示哀悼。
