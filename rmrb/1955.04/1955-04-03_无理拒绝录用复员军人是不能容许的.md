Unjustified Refusal to Employ Demobilized Soldiers is Unacceptable

To the Editor:

    Recently, we received reports from the Changde Special District and Changde City Demobilized Soldiers Construction Committee criticizing the personnel departments of the Central South Hydroelectric Engineering Bureau and the Guangzhou Railway Administration for refusing to employ demobilized soldiers.

    On January 17th this year, the Central South Hydroelectric Engineering Bureau sent Guo Keyi, head of the personnel section, to Changde City to recruit staff. The Changde Special Commissioner's Office of Culture and Education, in the name of students on leave of absence from their hometowns, introduced Xiong Guoxian, a demobilized soldier, to take the exam, and he was admitted. However, after Guo Keyi discovered that he was a student who had returned to school after being demobilized, he demanded to review his file. After the file was transferred, Guo Keyi, without even looking at it, said, "The quota is full, we don't need him." In fact, the quota was not full at the time. After saying "the quota is full," Guo Keyi immediately asked the Special Commissioner's Office to notify the Yiyang City Culture and Education Section to recruit another twenty people. At that time, the Changde Special District Demobilized Soldiers Construction Committee suggested that she recruit some qualified demobilized soldiers in Yiyang City, but Guo Keyi said, "Demobilized soldiers are all people with poor work ability and low education." The comrades of the Special Commissioner's Office explained to her, "There are many intellectuals, party members, and Youth League members among the demobilized soldiers." She replied, "If we want to absorb demobilized soldiers, there are plenty in Wuhan, so there is no need to come here." And said, "The Ministry of Fuel Industry has not instructed us to take demobilized soldiers." In this way, all the demobilized soldiers who applied were unreasonably rejected by her.

    In early February, the Guangzhou Railway Administration sent Hua Dacheng to Changde City to recruit staff. At that time, the comrades of the Changde Special Commissioner's Office also repeatedly requested to recruit some qualified demobilized soldiers, but Hua Dacheng also refused on the grounds that he had not received instructions from his superiors. After repeated requests, he reluctantly agreed to look at the file materials. Therefore, the relevant departments of the Special Commissioner's Office selected the file materials of eleven young people with better political conditions (including nine Youth League members) and higher education levels for him to review. After reviewing the materials, Hua Dacheng said, "Some families are landlords, some have complicated social relations, some are in poor health, some..., only three are barely qualified, but they can only be decided after a physical examination." Who knew that the three who were already considered "barely" qualified also suffered the fate of "the quota is enough, we don't need any" after a few days!

    We believe that the practice of the personnel departments of the Central South Hydroelectric Engineering Bureau and the Guangzhou Railway Administration in refusing to employ demobilized soldiers is wrong and inconsistent with the spirit of the central government's instructions to properly resettle demobilized soldiers and give them priority in employment. This not only adds a lot of difficulties to the resettlement of demobilized and transferred construction soldiers, but also has a negative impact on the cause of national defense construction and the implementation of the compulsory military service system. We hope that the relevant leading departments will quickly correct this.

### 无理拒绝录用复员军人是不能容许的

    无理拒绝录用复员军人是不能容许的编辑同志：
    最近我们接到常德专区和常德市的转业建设委员会的报告，批评中南水力发电工程局、广州铁路管理局人事部门拒绝录用复员军人。
    今年一月十七日，中南水力发电工程局派人事科长郭客仪到常德市去招考工作人员。常德专署文教科曾以在乡休学学生的名义，介绍复员军人熊国贤前去报考，结果录取了。但后来郭客仪一发现他是复员后再复学的学生，就提出要审查档案。档案调去后，郭客仪还没有看档案，就说：“名额已满了，不要了。”实际上当时名额并没有满；郭客仪在说“名额已满”的话以后，马上又要专署通知益阳市文教科再收二十人。当时，常德专区转业建设委员会就向她建议在益阳市招收一部分符合条件的复员军人，郭客仪却说：“复员回来的都是工作能力差、文化水平低的人。”专署的同志向她解释说：“复员军人中有不少知识分子、党员和团员。”她回答说：“如果要吸收复员军人的话，武汉市有的是，也就不需要到这里来了。”并说：“燃料工业部没有指示要复员军人。”就这样，所有报考的复员军人便无理地被她拒绝了。
    二月初旬，广州铁路管理局派华大成到常德市招考工作人员，当时，常德专署的同志也曾数次请求招收一部分条件合格的复员军人，华大成也借口没得到上级指示来拒绝。经过再次提出意见，他才勉强同意看看档案材料再说。于是，专署有关部门挑选了十一名政治条件较好（其中九名是青年团员）、文化程度较高的青年的档案材料，请他审查。华大成审查材料后说：“有的家庭是地主，有的社会关系复杂，有的身体差，有的……，只有三个还勉强，但要经过体格检查后才能决定。”谁知，就是已经认为“勉强”合格的三个，过了几天也遭到“名额够了，一个也不要了”的命运！
    我们认为，中南水力发电工程局、广州铁路管理局人事部门拒绝录用复员军人的作法，是错误的，是同中央妥善安置复员军人和优先就业指示的精神不相符的。这不但给复员、转业建设军人的安置工作增加了很多困难，而且对国防建设事业及义务兵役制的推行都将造成不良的影响。希望有关领导部门迅速加以纠正。      湖南省转业建设委员会
