One Shouldn't Vacillate in Architectural Thought
Mou Lan

Since the newspapers have launched criticisms of various wasteful phenomena in architecture, many units have conducted inspections, some have modified designs that are in progress, and some have reduced unnecessary structures and decorations on projects that have already started. This is naturally a welcome phenomenon.

However, there are two ways to modify designs and reduce projects:

One way is to see the great momentum against waste and then act hastily, picking up a pen as if it were an axe and hacking wildly at the blueprints, cutting off necessary contour lines on the facade and cutting off all reasonable and necessary decorations. While modifying, they grumble: "As long as it's cheap, it's a good thing, it doesn't matter if it's beautiful or not, who cares what form it takes!" In this way, money? Can be saved, yes; image? But it becomes ugly and unsightly – it becomes a bare "square box"! Those who advocate structuralism are most pleased with this approach, and they secretly laugh: "In the past, didn't you oppose the 'square box'? How about it? You still have to go down this road!" But the people do not like such buildings, because the people oppose waste but not beauty, and doing so is dereliction of duty and will still be opposed.

The other way is to oppose waste from a positive perspective, working with an honest attitude. Not only is the new design regarded as a creation, but also the modification of the design and the reduction of the project is transformed into a process of re-creation, and at the same time into a process of fighting against various architectural schools – neither revivalism and aestheticism, nor structuralism. Therefore, when carrying out the work, we strive to reduce the unreasonable structures and decorations, and strive to make a building more in line with the architectural principles pointed out by the Party and the government. The people welcome this approach, because it can provide us with more houses that conform to the principles of "suitability, economy, and beauty where possible."

The facts of the past few years have proved that the first approach is wrong and the latter is correct. Perhaps someone has asked: "Isn't this too demanding of architectural units, design agencies, and architects!" Not at all. Since they are undertaking the tasks entrusted to them by the people, they should treat their work with creative labor, and creation is certainly not an easy task. Perhaps some will cry out:
"Neither left nor right is acceptable! Show us a building as an example!" This is also a wrong idea. If that were the case, it would be enough to reprint the drawings of one or several buildings and distribute tens of millions of copies, why bother to establish and expand design forces, and why bother to vigorously cultivate talents in this field! We do not deny that there are indeed difficulties in architectural work, but no matter how many difficulties there are, as long as those engaged in architecture establish a sense of responsibility as masters and work and create in accordance with the principles instructed by the Party and the government at all times, they will certainly be able to achieve results. In our people's country, what difficulties can stop us from moving forward! Only those who vacillate in architectural thought cannot build good buildings.

    在建筑思想上不应该左右摇摆
    牟澜
    自从报上对建筑中各种浪费现象展开批评后，许多单位都进行了检查，有的修改正在进行的设计，有的削减已开工工程上不必要的结构和装饰。这自然是可喜的现象。
    但是，修改设计和削减工程有两种做法：
    一种，看到反浪费的劲头挺大，于是就草率从事，提起笔，宛如板斧，在图纸上乱砍一通，砍掉立面上必要的轮廓线，砍掉合理的必要的一切装饰。一边改、一边愤愤不平：“只要便宜就是好东西，美不美没有关系，管它是什么形式！”如此，钱么？倒可以省下一些；形象呢？却变得丑陋不堪——成了光秃秃的“方盒子”了！提倡结构主义的人最高兴这种做法，会暗暗笑道：“过去，你们不是反对‘方盒子’吗，怎样？还是得走这条路吧！”但，人民却不喜欢这样的建筑，因为人民反对浪费却不反对美观，那样做是失职的，仍要遭到反对。
    另一种，从积极方面反对浪费，用老老实实的态度进行工作。不但把新的设计看作是创作，也把修改设计、削减工程变成再一次创作的过程，同时变成向各种建筑流派进行斗争的过程——既不要复古主义、唯美主义，也不要结构主义。因此，进行工作时，力求减掉不合理的结构和装饰部分，努力于使一个建筑更符合党和政府所指出的建筑原则。人民欢迎这种做法，因为这可使我们有更多的合乎“适用、经济、在可能条件下美观”原则的各种房屋。
    过去几年来的事实证明，第一种做法是错误的，后一种做法是正确的。也许有人曾问：“这对建筑单位、设计机关、建筑师的要求太苛了吧！”一点也不是。既然他们承担着人民赋予的任务，就应该以创造性的劳动对待工作，要创造当然不会是一件很容易的事。也许会有人叫唤：
  “左也不是、右也不是！指出一个建筑给我们作榜样吧！”这也是错误的想法。如果真是这样，只要翻印一种或几种建筑的图纸，发行几千万份就够了，何必要建立和扩大设计力量、何必还要大力培养这方面的人材呢！我们并不否认在建筑工作中确实有困难，但不管有多少困难，只要从事建筑的人树立主人翁的责任心，时刻按照党和政府所指示的原则去工作、去创造，一定能做出成绩。在我们人民的国家里又有什么困难能阻挡我们前进的呢！只有在建筑思想上左右摇摆的人才盖不出好的建筑物来。
