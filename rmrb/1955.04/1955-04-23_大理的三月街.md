The annual March Street Fair in Dali, Yunnan, which concluded in mid-April, was particularly prosperous this year. The 500,000 person-visits included people of various ethnic groups from the western border areas of Yunnan, as well as procurement personnel from state-owned medicinal materials companies and private merchants from Shanghai, Guangzhou, Henan, Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, and Kunming. The total transaction value of the eight state-owned trading organizations and private merchants on March Street reached more than 820,000 yuan, and the retail transaction volume also increased by two-thirds compared with last year. The local and special products sold by the various ethnic groups were mostly purchased by state-owned trading companies and private merchants. All 66,500 jin of medicinal materials that were put on the market were sold out. Tibetan merchants also purchased more than 160,000 jin of tea for shipment to Tibet and Xikang.

With the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement and the increase in rural purchasing power, various industrial products of better quality, such as fabrics and general merchandise, have become best-selling goods at the March Street Fair. The first agricultural production cooperative in Renliyi Village, a place where the Bai people of Dali County live together, bought a double-wheeled double-share plow manufactured by the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory. Rural reading materials such as "Questions and Answers on Agricultural Production Cooperatives" and "Complete Collection of Daily Use in Rural Areas" sold by Xinhua Bookstore have become bestsellers.

An exhibition of agriculture, health, pictures of national construction, and local and special products was also held at the March Street Fair.

The horse racing event held at the March Street Fair in previous years has been expanded this year into a sports performance competition for people of various ethnic groups in western Yunnan. (Xinhua News Agency)

    大理的三月街
    在四月中旬结束的一年一度的云南大理三月街，今年显得特别繁荣。先后赶街的五十万人次中，包括云南西部边区的各族人民，和来自上海、广州、河南、四川、西康、贵州、昆明等地的国营药材公司采购人员及私商。三月街上的八个国营贸易机构和私商的全部交易总值达八十二万多元，零售交易额也比去年增加了三分之二。各族人民出售的土产特产，大都为国营贸易公司及私商收购。上市的六万六千五百斤药材，全部卖完。藏族商人还购进了运往西藏、西康的茶叶十六万多斤。
    随着农业互助合作运动的开展，农村购买力的提高，一些品质较好的各种布匹、百货等工业品，都变成三月街的畅销货。大理县民家族聚居的仁里邑村第一农业生产合作社，买去了北京农业机械厂制造的双轮双铧犁。新华书店出售的“农业生产合作社问答”“农村日用大全”等农村读物，都成了畅销书籍。
    三月街上并举办了农业、卫生、祖国建设图片和土产特产等展览会。
    往年三月街上举行的赛马会，今年扩大为滇西各族人民体育表演比赛大会。   （新华社）
