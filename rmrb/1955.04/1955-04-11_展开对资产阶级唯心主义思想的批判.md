    Unfold the Criticism of Bourgeois Idealist Thought
    The Chinese Communist Party has grown up in the process of constantly fighting against various hostile ideologies with Marxism-Leninism. The history of the Party's development and victory over the past thirty years is also a history of the victory of Marxist-Leninist thought over various hostile ideologies.
    Now our Party is realizing its tasks of socialist construction and socialist transformation. With the progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation, the class struggle has become more complex and acute. Class enemies at home and abroad are trying to undermine the cause of socialism. One of the most important methods they use to undermine our cause is to oppose Marxist thought with bourgeois thought, and materialist world outlook with idealist world outlook. They use this method to resist transformation, hinder social progress, hinder the progress of science and culture, hinder the development of construction, and corrupt the working people, even corrupting our Party.
    Because we still adopt a policy of alliance with the national bourgeoisie, because the petty bourgeoisie still exists like a vast ocean, because of the existence of capitalist encirclement, and also because we have not adequately promoted Marxist thought, bourgeois erroneous ideas still have a large market outside the Party, and even inside the Party; the world outlook of many intellectuals is still an idealist world outlook; many Party cadres and many intellectuals cannot distinguish between materialist thought and idealist thought; many Party cadres are themselves idealists in their thinking, or are captured by idealist thought, and often show a tendency to coexist peacefully with idealist thought, or even surrender to idealist thought; in many academic and cultural fields, although there are debates between materialist thought and idealist thought, the criticism of idealism has not been fully unfolded, and on many issues, erroneous ideas still prevail, or still have a great influence.
    This situation of struggle must arouse the attention of the whole Party and the people of the whole country. This is a reflection of an extremely complex and sharp class struggle on the ideological front. In order to smoothly realize the Party's general line during the transition period, in order to guarantee victory on the economic front, it is necessary to simultaneously launch a struggle on the ideological front and achieve victory.
    Our Party attaches importance to leading the ideological struggle. The direct purpose of the ideological remoulding movement of intellectuals from 1951 to 1952 was to eliminate feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas, and also to give a preliminary criticism to bourgeois erroneous ideas. The criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" aroused widespread attention, making everyone realize that it is necessary to wage a resolute struggle against bourgeois erroneous ideas. However, in the past few years, it has not been possible to conduct a systematic criticism of bourgeois thought, especially bourgeois philosophy—idealist thought, and this task must now be undertaken. The purpose of the current criticism of the bourgeois ideas of Hu Shi, Yu Pingbo, Hu Feng, etc., is to overcome the influence of bourgeois idealist thought and to widely disseminate dialectical materialism and historical materialism among intellectuals and the masses.
    To unfold the criticism of bourgeois idealist thought is an effective method of publicizing materialism in academic circles and among intellectuals inside and outside the Party, an effective method of promoting academic discussion and scientific progress, an effective method of promoting the growth of new Marxist forces in various academic fields, and an effective method of cultivating and organizing a theoretical work force.
    In order to carry out the struggle against bourgeois idealism on academic issues, it is first necessary to overcome some erroneous ideas on this issue. The manifestations of these ideas are: the idol worship of bourgeois "celebrities," believing that they are "authorities" and cannot be criticized; adopting a bourgeois aristocratic attitude towards young Marxist academic workers and suppressing them; some Party members regard themselves as "authorities" and do not allow others to criticize themselves, and do not conduct self-criticism; some Party members do not criticize the mistakes of others because of personal friendship or face-saving, and even cover them up, and so on. It is necessary to adhere to the principle that no one can have any privileges in academic criticism and discussion. Party members can criticize Party members, and they can also criticize non-Party members; non-Party members can also criticize Party members and non-Party members; any famous or unknown academic worker can make criticisms of others and be criticized by others. Communist Party members should play an exemplary role in criticism and self-criticism. To regard oneself as an "authority," suppress criticism, or turn a blind eye to bourgeois erroneous ideas, and adopt a liberal or even capitulationist attitude, is incompatible with the glorious title of a Communist Party member.
    Academic criticism and discussion should be reasoned and based on facts. That is to say: it is necessary to advocate sharp academic debates based on science. Criticism and discussion should be based on research work, and it is necessary to oppose adopting a simple and rude attitude. Explaining problems should strive for lively content, clear wording, and be good at analyzing specific facts. Resolving academic disputes should adopt the method of free discussion, and oppose adopting the method of administrative orders. Those who are criticized should be allowed to make counter-criticisms, rather than suppressing such counter-criticisms. Minorities holding different opinions should be allowed to retain their own opinions, rather than implementing the principle of the minority obeying the majority. After a conclusion has been reached, if new dissenting opinions arise, discussion should still be allowed. This is to reduce concerns in academic circles, dare to boldly launch debates on different opinions, so as to give readers a profound education, so that they know what is truly right and what is truly wrong, in order to achieve the purpose of thoroughly criticizing bourgeois erroneous ideas, and to achieve the purpose of correctly resolving academic issues.
    Academic criticism and discussion should generally be subordinate to the basic policy of publicizing materialism and Marxist thought to the broad masses of intellectuals and the people. Therefore, the main content and language form of criticism and discussion should strive to be understood and arouse interest among the broad masses, and focus on explaining the basic viewpoints of Marxism positively, systematically, and as simply as possible in the process of criticism and discussion, so that various readers feel that they have benefited from reading. Whether it is publicizing materialism or conducting academic criticism and discussion, it is for the purpose of helping socialist construction and socialist transformation, opposing imperialism, and defending the motherland. Therefore, this kind of publicity and discussion should strive to be linked to the urgent issues of our country's socialist construction and transformation, to the urgent issues of the current international and domestic class struggle, to the urgent issues in the work of the Party and the state, so that intellectuals, cadres, and the masses can learn to correctly understand these urgent issues from a Marxist point of view through this kind of publicity and education. Attention should be paid to combining the publicity work of materialism with concrete and practical research work in the process of ideological criticism, so that comrades can use materialism as a guide for their research work, and can use the principles of materialism to summarize the experience of various work, explain and solve problems. That is to say, when publicizing materialism to cadres and intellectuals, it is necessary to emphasize the Marxist principle of linking theory with practice, guide them to criticize the idealist ideas in their minds, criticize the bourgeois ideas they come into contact with in their actual work and life, and apply the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to understand and solve the problems they encounter in their work.
    Attention should be paid to discovering and cultivating new Marxist forces in academic circles and organizing and cultivating a theoretical work force in the process of ideological criticism. In recent years, young Marxist academic workers have gradually increased, some Party member academic workers and non-Party Marxist academic workers have returned to their original posts, and some of the old academic workers have also been ideologically transformed. These forces should all be effectively organized. In the development of the Party's theoretical work, young Marxist academic workers will inevitably be able to increase day by day. This is the hope for the development of our country's academia. They must be discovered, their situation must be understood, and they must be given the necessary guidance and help in the criticism of bourgeois erroneous ideas and in the process of academic criticism and discussion. The outstanding figures among them must be placed in appropriate work positions.
    When carrying out the criticism of bourgeois erroneous ideas and the criticism and discussion of academic issues, it is necessary to adhere to the Party's united front policy and the policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals. First, it is necessary to distinguish between the three parties of ideological enemy, friend, and ourselves. Representative figures who ideologically adhere to bourgeois erroneous viewpoints should be regarded as ideological enemies, a struggle should be launched against them, they should be ideologically isolated, and the influence of this bourgeois erroneous thought among the masses should be eliminated. Intellectuals who have mistakes but tend towards materialism should be regarded as friends and helped to make progress. Second, it is necessary to distinguish between political counter-revolutionaries and those who make mistakes in academic thought. Academic workers with serious bourgeois erroneous viewpoints in academic thought, as long as they are not political counter-revolutionaries, should be guaranteed to obtain work positions suitable for them, guaranteed that they have the possibility of continuing to conduct research useful to society, respect and give play to their expertise useful to society, and impart this expertise to young people, while encouraging them to actively participate in academic criticism and discussion and implement self-transformation.
    There are approximately five million cadres and intellectuals with reading ability in the Party, military, cultural and educational systems, economic systems, political and legal systems, and other departments and mass organizations throughout the country. It is necessary to ensure that the vast majority of them (for example, three million people) can understand the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, understand the difference between materialism and idealism, understand the basic content of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and through them, educate the vast masses of people with lower cultural levels with materialist ideas. This is an extremely arduous task, and it is necessary to correctly implement a long-term ideological work plan nationwide in order to achieve this goal. Party committees at all levels must conscientiously lead this work, conscientiously solve the problems that arise in the work, pay attention to discovering and cultivating new Marxist forces in academic circles, organize and cultivate a theoretical work force, and in the struggle against bourgeois idealist thought, continuously expand the position of materialist thought, and continuously weaken and even eliminate the influence of bourgeois idealist thought among the broad masses of the people, so that the materialist thought of Marxism can be grasped by the broad masses of the people, and thus transform into a material force for building a socialist society.
    It must be clearly recognized that the theoretical foundation of Marxism-Leninism is dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and the core of any form of bourgeois thought is the idealist world outlook. Therefore, the most fundamental task of the Party in ideological work is to publicize materialist thought, oppose idealist thought, so that Party cadres can understand the relationship between thought and objective existence, understand that thought and consciousness are reflections of objective existence, understand that it is necessary to promote the work of the Party and the state according to the laws of development of social reality, so as to improve their theoretical level and political awareness, and facilitate learning to use the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism in actual work to improve the work of the Party and the state; at the same time, it enables the broad masses of people to break away from the influence of bourgeois thought, greatly improve their degree of awareness in striving to build a socialist society, and facilitate the formation of political and ideological unity based on Marxism-Leninism. Although this task is extremely arduous, we believe that with the long-term efforts of the whole Party and the people of the whole country, this task will definitely be completed victoriously.

### 展开对资产阶级唯心主义思想的批判

    展开对资产阶级唯心主义思想的批判
    中国共产党是在以马克思列宁主义思想同各种敌对思想进行不断战斗的过程中成长起来的。三十多年来党的发展和胜利的历史也是马克思列宁主义思想战胜各种敌对思想而获得发展的历史。
    现在我们的党正在实现社会主义建设和社会主义改造的任务。随着社会主义建设和社会主义改造的进展，阶级斗争更为复杂和尖锐起来了。国内外阶级敌人力图破坏社会主义的事业。他们破坏我们事业的最重要的方法之一，就是用资产阶级思想反对马克思主义思想，用唯心主义世界观反对唯物主义世界观。他们用这个方法抗拒改造，阻碍社会进步，阻碍科学和文化的进步，阻碍建设事业的发展，并腐蚀劳动人民，直到腐蚀我们的党。
    由于我们对民族资产阶级还采取联合的政策，由于小资产阶级还像汪洋大海一样地存在，由于资本主义包围的存在，也由于我们对于马克思主义思想宣传得不充分，资产阶级错误思想在党外，甚至在党内，还有很大市场；很多知识分子的世界观还是唯心主义的世界观；许多党员干部和许多知识分子不能辨别什么是唯物主义思想、什么是唯心主义思想；不少党员干部自己在思想上还是唯心主义者，或者被唯心主义思想所俘掳，时常表现着同唯心主义思想和平共居，甚至于表现为向唯心主义思想投降的倾向；许多学术和文化领域中虽然存在着唯物主义思想和唯心主义思想斗争的争论，但是对唯心主义的批判却还不能充分展开，在不少问题上错误思想还占着上风，或者还有很大影响。
    这种斗争形势必须引起全党和全国人民的注意。这是一场极其复杂和尖锐的阶级斗争在思想战线上的反映。为了顺利地实现党在过渡时期的总路线，为了保证经济战线上的胜利，必须同时在思想战线上展开斗争并取得胜利。
    我们的党是重视领导思想斗争的。一九五一年至一九五二年间对知识分子的思想改造运动的直接目的是清除封建的、买办的、法西斯的思想，同时也对资产阶级的错误思想给了初步的批判。关于电影“武训传”的批判引起了广泛的注意，使大家认识到必须对资产阶级错误思想进行坚决的斗争。但是在过去几年中，还没有能对资产阶级思想特别是资产阶级的哲学——唯心主义思想进行有系统的批判，而这个任务现在是必须着手了。目前开展的对胡适、俞平伯、胡风等人的资产阶级思想的批判的目的，就是要克服资产阶级唯心主义思想的影响，把辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义思想在知识分子和人民群众中作广泛的传播。
    开展对资产阶级唯心主义思想的批判，是在学术界中、在党内外知识分子中宣传唯物主义的有效方法，是推动学术讨论和科学进步的有效方法，是促进各个学术领域中马克思主义新生力量生长的有效方法，是培养和组织理论工作队伍的有效方法。
    为了开展在学术问题上的反对资产阶级唯心主义的斗争，必须首先克服在这个问题上的一些错误思想。这些思想的表现是：对资产阶级“名人”的偶像崇拜，认为他们是“权威”，不能批评；对青年的马克思主义的学术工作者采取资产阶级贵族老爷的态度，对他们实行压制；某些党员以“权威”自居，不许别人批评自己，不进行自我批评；某些党员因为私人友情或情面的关系，对别人的错误不去批评，甚至加以掩护，等等。必须坚持这样的原则：在学术的批评和讨论中，任何人都不能有什么特权。党员可以批评党员，也可以批评非党员；非党员同样可以批评党员和非党员；任何著名的或不著名的学术工作者都可以对别人提出批评和受到别人的批评。共产党员的学术工作者应当在批评和自我批评上起模范作用。以“权威”自居，压制批评，或者对资产阶级错误思想熟视无睹，采取自由主义甚至投降主义的态度，都是同共产党员的光荣称号不相容的。
    学术批评和讨论，应当是说理的，实事求是的。这就是说：应当提倡建立在科学基础上的尖锐的学术论争。批评和讨论应当以研究工作为基础，反对采取简单、粗暴的态度。说明问题，应当力求内容生动，辞句明白，善于分析具体的事实。解决学术的争论，应当采取自由讨论的方法，反对采取行政命令的方法。应当容许被批评者进行反批评，而不是压制这种反批评。应当容许持有不同意见的少数人保留自己的意见，而不是实行少数服从多数的原则。在已经做了结论之后，如果发生新的不同意见，仍然容许讨论。这样做，是为了使学术界减少顾虑，敢于大胆展开不同意见的争论，从而给读者以深刻的教育，使他们知道什么是真正对的，什么是真正错的，以便达到对资产阶级错误思想彻底批判的目的，达到正确解决学术问题的目的。
    学术的批评和讨论，一般地应当服从于向广大知识分子和人民宣传唯物主义和马克思主义思想的基本方针。因此，批评和讨论的主要内容和语言形式，应当力求使广大群众能够理解和发生兴趣，并着重在批评和讨论的过程中正面地有系统地和力求浅显地解释马克思主义的各项基本观点，以便各种读者读了都觉得有所获益。无论宣传唯物主义或进行学术的批评讨论，都是为了帮助社会主义建设和社会主义改造，反对帝国主义，保卫祖国。因此这种宣传和讨论应当力求联系到当前我国社会主义建设和改造的迫切问题，联系到当前国际国内阶级斗争的迫切问题，联系到党和国家工作中的迫切问题，使知识分子、干部和人民群众能够经过这种宣传教育，学会用马克思主义的观点正确地理解这些迫切问题。应当注意在思想批判的过程中，善于把唯物主义的宣传工作和具体的实际的研究工作结合起来，使同志们能够运用唯物主义作为自己研究工作的向导，能够运用唯物主义的原理总结各种工作的经验，说明和解决问题。这也就是说，在向干部和知识分子进行唯物主义思想的宣传的时候，必须强调理论和实际联系的马克思主义的原则，引导他们去批判自己头脑中的唯心主义思想，批判自己在实际工作和生活中所接触到的资产阶级思想，应用马克思主义的立场、观点、方法去认识和解决自己工作中所遇到的问题。
    应当注意在思想批判的过程中发现和培养学术界中马克思主义的新生力量，组织和培养理论工作的队伍。近几年来，青年的马克思主义的学术工作者已经逐渐增加，有些党员的学术工作者和党外的马克思主义学术工作者回到了自己原来的岗位，旧的学术工作者中间也有一部分在思想上得到了改造，这些力量都应当有效地组织起来。在党的理论工作的发展中，青年的马克思主义的学术工作者必然能够日益增加起来，这是我国学术发展的希望。必须在对资产阶级错误思想的批判中，在学术批评和讨论的过程中，发现他们，了解他们的情况，给他们以必要的指导和帮助，把他们之中的优秀人物放到适当的工作岗位上。
    在进行对资产阶级错误思想的批判和学术问题的批评和讨论的时候，应当坚持党的统一战线政策和团结改造知识分子的政策。首先，应当分清思想上的敌友我三方。对于思想上坚持资产阶级错误观点的代表人物，应当视为思想上的敌人，展开斗争，使他们在思想上孤立，肃清这种资产阶级错误思想在群众中的影响。对于虽有错误，但是倾向于唯物主义的知识分子，应当视为朋友，帮助他们进步。其次，应当分清政治上的反革命分子和学术思想上犯错误的人。对学术思想上有严重的资产阶级错误观点的学术工作者，只要他们在政治上不是反革命分子，应当保障他们获得适合于他们的工作岗位，保障他们有可能继续进行对于社会有用的研究，尊重和发挥他们对社会有用的专长，并将这种专长传授给青年，同时鼓励他们积极参加学术的批评和讨论，实行自我改造。
    现在全国党的、军队的、文教系统的、经济系统的、政法系统的，以及其他部门和各群众团体的有阅读能力的干部和知识分子，大约有五百万人。要做到他们的绝大部分（例如三百万人）都能够了解马克思列宁主义的基本知识，了解唯物主义与唯心主义的区别，懂得辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的基本内容，并且通过他们，用唯物主义思想教育文化水平较低的广大的人民群众。这是一项极为艰巨的任务，必须正确地在全国范围内实现一个长期的思想工作计划，才能达到目的。各级党委一定要认真领导这一工作，认真解决工作中发生的问题，注意发现和培养学术界中马克思主义的新生力量，组织和培养理论工作的队伍，在对资产阶级唯心主义思想进行斗争中，不断地扩大唯物主义思想的阵地，不断地削弱以至肃清资产阶级唯心主义思想在广大人民群众中的影响，使马克思主义的唯物主义思想掌握广大人民群众，从而转化为建设社会主义社会的物质力量。
    必须明确认识：马克思列宁主义的理论基础是辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，而任何形式的资产阶级思想的核心就是唯心主义世界观。因此，党在思想工作中最根本的任务，就是宣传唯物主义的思想，反对唯心主义的思想，使党的干部能够懂得思想和客观存在的关系，懂得思想、意识是客观存在的反映，懂得要根据社会现实生活的发展规律来推进党的工作和国家的工作，从而提高自己的理论水平和政治觉悟，便于在实际工作中学会运用马克思列宁主义这个思想武器，改进党和国家工作；同时使广大人民脱离资产阶级思想的影响，大大提高他们为建设社会主义社会而奋斗的觉悟程度，便于形成以马克思列宁主义为基础的政治上和思想上的一致。这个任务虽然极为艰巨，但我们相信，依靠全党和全国人民的长期努力，这个任务是一定能够胜利完成的。
