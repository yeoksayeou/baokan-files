Avoid Unnecessary Meetings
Shi Ming

The Ministry of Fuel Industry recently, when mobilizing to reorganize institutions and improve the work of its agencies, calculated an account of meetings: last year, the ministry convened 96 meetings, and more than 1,200 cadres regularly attended these meetings in Beijing. The Coal Mine Management Bureau, subordinate to the Ministry of Fuel Industry, had more than 3,000 cadres regularly attending meetings in Beijing from July to the end of last year. This year, the Ministry of Fuel Industry's agencies in Beijing initially plan to hold 165 meetings, with 10,280 people from various places participating.

This is the situation in the Ministry of Fuel Industry. If other industrial departments were to calculate their accounts, the severity of the situation would likely be no less than that of the Ministry of Fuel Industry.

So many meetings consume a large amount of manpower, material resources, and time. Many lower-level agencies and industrial and mining enterprises regularly have large numbers of cadres stationed in Beijing attending various meetings throughout the year. For example, the Kailuan Coal Mine has about 400 cadres regularly attending meetings in Beijing. These people, year after year, alternately wear red ribbon delegate badges with various names, moving from one meeting venue to another, spending their days in endless meetings, becoming "meeting experts." Among these "meeting experts" are engineering and technical personnel from enterprises, and also some grassroots leading cadres from enterprises, who are not too many in the enterprises, but rather are very lacking.

With the large increase in the number of meetings, the facilities serving the meetings in various departments have also increased accordingly in recent years: the number of guesthouses has increased, the number of canteens has increased, the number of cars has increased, and the number of mimeograph and typing staff has also increased. The Ministry of Fuel Industry has established eight guesthouses in Beijing, but still often suffers from overcrowding. In the Beijing office of Kailuan Coal Mine, the corridors and floors are often filled with guests attending meetings.

Of course, we are not against holding meetings, nor are we saying that all meetings are a waste. Our country's industrial construction is expanding day by day, and economic affairs are becoming increasingly busy. Many problems must be solved through meetings, collective wisdom, exchange of experiences, and resolution of problems. However, today there are indeed many meetings that are formalistic, that can be avoided or reduced, that can shorten the meeting time and reduce the number of participants; and there are also many meetings that can be held not in the leading agencies, but can be held at the lower levels.

Streamlining meetings is not only to save a large amount of wasted manpower and material resources, but more importantly to improve our leadership work. Convening some necessary meetings is indeed one of the indispensable basic methods of leadership work. However, too many and cumbersome meetings are often of no benefit to the leaders, or are more harmful than beneficial. The increasingly complex economic construction work urgently requires our leading cadres to have more time to go deep into the grassroots, deep into the masses, to approach living things, meet with practical workers, and specifically solve various new problems. However, many leaders are now being held back by these meetings and cannot go down.

Avoid unnecessary meetings, so that enterprise cadres have more time to deal with enterprise work, so that leading cadres have more time to go deep into the grassroots, and reduce some unnecessary losses of manpower and material resources for the country.

    不开不必要的会议
    施明
    燃料工业部最近动员整编机构、改进机关工作时，算了一笔会议账：去年由部召开的会议有九十六次，经常在北京出席这些会议的干部有一千二百多人。燃料工业部所属的煤矿管理总局，去年七月到年底，经常在北京开会的有干部三千多人。今年燃料工业部在北京的机关，初步计划还要开一百六十五次会，各地要有一万零二百八十人来参加。
    这是燃料工业部的情况。其他工业部门如果都要算一下账，情况的严重程度很可能不在燃料工业部之下。
    这么多的会议，耗费了大量的人力物力和时间。有许多下级机关和工矿企业，经常有大批干部整年地被留在北京出席各种会议。譬如开滦煤矿经常在北京开会的干部就达四百人左右。这些人整年新旧交替地挂着各种名称的红绸代表证，从这个会场走到那个会场，成年累月地“泡”在永无休止的会议里，成了“开会专家”。这些“开会专家”中，有的是企业中的工程技术人员，也有些是企业的基层领导干部，他们在企业中不是太多，而是很缺乏的。
    随着会议次数的大量增加，近年来各部门为会议服务的设施，也都相应地增多了：招待所增多了，食堂增多了，汽车增多了，油印和打字人员也增多了。燃料工业部在北京已设立了八个招待所，仍常常有人满之患。开滦煤矿的驻京办事处里，经常连走廊、地板上都睡满了赴会的客人。
    当然，我们不是反对开会，也不是说所有会议都是浪费。我们国家的工业建设事业日益扩大了，经济事务日益繁忙了，有许多问题必须通过会议，集思广益，交流经验，解决问题。但是，今天也确实有许多会议，是形式主义的，是可以不开或者可以少开的，是可以缩短会议时间，减少会议人数的；还有许多会议，是可以不在领导机关里召开，而可以到下面去开的。
    精简会议，不单是为了节省大量人力物力的浪费，更重要的还是为了改进我们的领导工作。召开一些必要的会议，固然是领导工作不可缺的基本方法之一。但是过多的、繁琐的会议，对于领导常常是毫无裨益的，或者是益少害多的。日趋复杂的经济建设工作，迫切需要我们的领导干部有更多的时间深入基层，深入群众，去接近活生生的事物，和实际工作者见面，具体地解决各种新问题。但是，有不少领导人现在就被这些会议紧紧地拖着而下不去。
    不开不必要的会议，让企业干部有更多的时间去处理企业工作，让领导干部有更多的时间去深入基层，为国家减少一些不必要的人力物力的损失。
