Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 22nd: The Vietnamese People's Army has taken over the first section of the Cam Pha Mining Area in the Haiphong region on the 22nd.

At around 6:00 AM, the advance units of the Vietnamese People's Army, riding in vehicles displaying the gold-star red flag, entered Ong Mon city along the highway extending from Tien Yen, north to south. The once-quiet streets immediately became lively. Every household hung the gold-star red flag. Ong Mon is one of the good ports of North Vietnam, capable of accommodating ships weighing up to 10,000 tons. The coal produced in the Cam Pha Mining Area is exported from here.

The People's Army continued to advance and entered Cam Pha city at 8:30 AM, fifteen minutes after the French Union forces began their withdrawal. People in the city cheered around the trucks. Many young people held wooden frames, branches, and peace doves, waiting to build celebratory arches when the troops arrived. Women presented flowers to the soldiers on the vehicles.

The takeover of Cam Pha city was completed at around 9:00 AM. Subsequently, People's Army units took over various mining areas in batches. The workers warmly welcomed their loved ones. The Cam Pha Mining Area is the largest and best-equipped mining area in the Hong Gai coal mines, with 4,500 workers. Order was well-maintained during the takeover. The Cam Pha and Hong Gai coal miners, who had previously won the Second Class Resistance Medal during the war of resistance, resolutely fought against the other side's forced relocation of workers to the South after the ceasefire. Although their dormitories were burned down, the workers disregarded everything and stayed to welcome their own troops.

    越南人民军接管海防地区的锦普矿区
    新华社河内二十二日电　二十二日，越南人民军已经接管了海防地区第一段锦普矿区。
    上午六时许，越南人民军先头部队乘坐插着金星红旗的汽车，沿着从先安自北向南伸延的公路进入了翁门市。原来一片寂静的街道，立刻热闹起来。家家户户都挂起了金星红旗。翁门是北越良港之一，可容万吨重的船只入港。锦普矿区出产的煤都从这里出口。
    人民军继续前进，在八时半就开进了法兰西联邦部队在十五分钟前开始撤离的锦普市。市内的人们围着卡车欢呼。许多青年手里拿着木架、树枝及和平鸽，等待部队到来时就搭起彩楼。妇女们拿着鲜花献给车上的战士。
    锦普市在上午九时许接管完毕。接着，人民军部队又分批接管各矿区。工人们热烈欢迎着自己的亲人。锦普矿区是鸿基煤矿中最大和设备最完善的矿区，这里有四千五百工人。接管时各处秩序良好。在抗战时期曾经荣获二级抗战勋章的锦普、鸿基煤矿工人在停战以后曾经坚决进行反对对方强迫工人南迁的斗争。虽然他们的宿舍被烧掉，但是，工人们仍不顾一切留下来迎接自己的部队。
