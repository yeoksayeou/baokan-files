    Wuhan City Textile Company Prepares Summer Fabrics Based on Citizens' Needs According to the Demands of Citizens
    The Wuhan City Textile Company has prepared a large quantity of suitable summer fabrics according to the needs of citizens.
    In order to fully meet the needs of the people in terms of cotton fabric varieties and designs, the company held a "Cotton Fabric Variety and Pattern Selection Meeting" in mid-February to widely collect opinions from the masses on cotton fabric varieties and patterns. A total of eighty-five varieties, totaling four hundred and seventy-four colors, produced and newly designed over the years were exhibited at the meeting. There were also product samples of more than five hundred colors transferred from outside the district, with a total of more than seven thousand various patterns. A total of two hundred and thirty-eight representatives of workers, students, teachers, shop assistants, residents, and cotton fabric production department staff were invited to participate in the selection.
    The representatives who participated in the selection and the masses who visited put forward opinions such as the white background of the bed sheet cloth not being white enough and the variety of colored stripe patterns. The company redesigned eight elegant color schemes for bed sheet stripes and bed sheet grids, and also strengthened the bleaching degree of the white background. As summer is approaching, consumers hope to increase the supply of poplin. The company designed more than ten kinds of striped and checkered poplin, and at the same time transferred a large number of printed cloths, various patterns of seersucker, and screen-printed lawn. In addition, dozens of novel patterns and colors popular with people have become the company's standard samples for processing and the blueprint for weaving in the second quarter.

    武汉市花纱布公司根据市民要求准备夏季布料
    武汉市花纱布公司已经根据市民的要求，准备好了大批适用的夏季布料。
    为了能使棉布品种花色充分满足人民的需要，公司在二月中旬曾举办了一次“棉布品种、花样评选会”，广泛地搜集了人民群众对棉布品种、花样的意见。会上展出了历年加工生产的和新设计的品种共计八十五个，计四百七十四个色种，还有区外调进的产品样本五百余色种，各种花型共达七千余个。被邀请到会参加评选的有工人、学生、教职员、店员、居民及棉布生产部门工作人员的代表共二百三十八人。
    参加评选的代表和参观的群众，曾提出各种被单布白底不白，彩条色样繁多等意见。公司就新设计了被单条、被单格八种配色素雅的花型，对白底也加强了漂白程度。由于夏天快到，消费者们希望能增加些府绸供应。公司就设计了十多种条格府绸，并同时调进了大批花布、各种花型的泡泡纱和网印花罗。此外，几十种受人们欢迎的新颖花型、色泽，就成为公司第二季度加工的标样及织造的蓝本。（陈庸
