Gansu Province has completed the spring wheat sowing work in various regions. The completion of spring wheat planting in the Yinchuan Special District and the Hedong Hui Autonomous Region was approximately three to four days to six to seven days earlier than in previous years. Over the past winter and this spring, mutual aid and cooperation organizations in these areas have greatly developed. During the spring planting period, relevant departments promptly supplied production materials. Coupled with the heavy snowfall and good soil moisture content last winter, the spring sowing work this year has proceeded very smoothly. Many areas promoted improved varieties during sowing. The "Biyu Wheat" was promoted in the Yinchuan Special District, while the "No. 96" and "No. 774" wheat varieties were promoted in the Dingxi and Wuwei Special Districts, respectively. Many regions also paid attention to improving sowing methods, changing the backward broadcast sowing to row sowing. The row-sown area in Dingxin County increased by 20% compared to 1954, and row sowing was adopted in several major wheat-producing areas in Zhangye County. Cross-sowing was also promoted in the Yinchuan Special District.

The spring wheat planting areas in Gansu Province include most parts of five special districts including Wuwei and Yinchuan, the two Hui autonomous regions of Hedong and Xihai Gu, and parts of special districts such as Tianshui. The output of spring wheat accounts for one-half of the province's total wheat production. The timely completion of spring wheat sowing will play a certain guaranteeing role in increasing grain production this year. (Our correspondent stationed in Lanzhou)

    甘肃各地完成春麦播种工作
    甘肃省各地已经结束春麦播种工作。银川专区和河东回族自治区种完春麦时间，约比往年提前三、四天到六、七天。去冬今春，这些地区的互助合作组织有了很大发展，春种期间，有关部门及时供应了生产资料，再加上去冬雪多墒好，所以今年春播工作进行得很顺利。许多地区在播种中推广了优良品种。银川专区推广了“碧玉麦”，定西专区和武威专区分别推广了“九六号”和“七七四号”小麦。不少地区还注意改进播种方法，把落后的撒播改为条播。鼎新县条播面积比一九五四年增加百分之二十，张掖县几个主要产麦区都采用了条播。银川专区还推行了交叉播种。
    甘肃省种植春麦地区，包括武威、银川等五个专区，河东、西海固两个回族自治区的大部分地方和天水等专区的一部分地方。春麦产量占全省小麦产量的二分之一。春麦播种及时完成，将对今年粮食增产起一定保证作用。（本报驻兰州记者）
