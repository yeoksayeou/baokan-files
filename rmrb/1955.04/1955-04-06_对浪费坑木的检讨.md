Self-Criticism on Waste of Pit Props

Wang Shuren, Director of Benxi Mining Bureau
Tian Datian, Deputy Director

The situation of pit prop waste in Benxi Mining Bureau, as criticized in the article "Why Do State-Owned Coal Mines Overspend on Pit Props Every Year?" published in the People's Daily on January 8, is completely factual and entirely correct. We sincerely accept this criticism. We have inspected and studied the causes of pit prop waste in Benxi Coal Mine and have formulated specific improvement measures.

The main reasons for the waste of pit props are the weak economic accounting perspective of the bureau and mine leaders, insufficient understanding of the importance of comprehensively completing national tasks, neglecting cost accounting, failing to promptly inspect the specific work below, and inadequate education for cadres, which has fostered a supply-system mentality among some cadres who completely disregard the recycling and utilization of old pit props. Sometimes, old pit props and crushed stones are even put in crushed stone trucks and dumped on the mountains. Secondly, the management system is unsound, the supply and use departments are not in contact with each other, relevant personnel lack a concept of cherishing state property, and the pit prop supply department does not promptly understand the specifications of pit props required by each workshop, resulting in the supply of pit props that do not meet actual needs. The personnel in charge of receiving pit props in the workshop do not maintain close contact with the district team leaders, and the received pit props are not suitable for use. In terms of transportation, sometimes the pit props for the shift are not delivered, and sometimes they are sent to the wrong location. When the user departments encounter "large materials" or "long materials," they casually modify them to be smaller or shorter, and the cut-off wood and wood ends are casually loaded into stone trucks and dumped on the mountains. In addition, the ordered pit prop sizes are not suitable for needs, and factory protection equipment is inadequate, so citizens can casually enter the factory and take away pit props. Due to the above reasons, the phenomenon of pit prop waste has long existed. At a time when the country urgently needs to accumulate funds for industrialization, we have turned a blind eye to such a serious waste phenomenon, which is wrong.

Through this inspection, it was also found that the waste of raw coal is also serious. Now, in response to the specific situation, we have established the following systems:

Regarding pit prop management: Each district submits a list of pit prop specifications to the supply section every five days, and the daily pit prop clearing list must be submitted to the supply section after being reviewed by the district chief. The supply section should strictly supply pit props according to the specifications required by each working face. In terms of transportation, all pit props remaining underground for the shift must be delivered completely during the shift, and no accumulation is allowed. The recovered old pit props must also be delivered to the designated location. The old pit props that can be used by the district must be retained for use. Those that cannot be used are not allowed to be loaded into coal and stone trucks and must be handed over to the transportation department for transfer to the pit prop recycling plant for material utilization.

Regarding raw coal management: The excavation and repair team leader stipulates the amount of coal produced and the amount of pit props recovered in the task book according to the specific situation of each site, and an inspection is carried out after the work is completed. The excavation and repair section establishes a cumulative material for recovered coal and recovered pit props in units of groups, publishes it on time, and conducts criticism and commendation. Coal, stone, and wood must be loaded into separate trucks and must not be loaded into one truck.

In addition, product standards are also stipulated as the basis for inspecting quality and paying wages.

After taking the above measures, the situation has begun to improve. In the future, we must continue to inspect the implementation of these systems and improve them in order to fight for the complete elimination of waste.

    对浪费坑木的检讨
    本溪矿务局局长　王树人  副局长　田大田
    一月八日人民日报发表的“国营煤矿的坑木为什么年年超支”一文中所批评的本溪矿务局浪费坑木的情况，是完全符合事实的，也是完全正确的。我们诚恳地接受这一批评。对本溪煤矿浪费坑木的原因，我们已进行检查和研究，并定出了具体改进措施。
    造成坑木浪费的原因，主要是局矿领导上的经济核算观点薄弱，对全面完成国家任务的重要意义认识不足，忽视成本核算，对下面的具体工作没有及时检查，对干部的教育也做得不够，因而使下面一些干部滋长了供给制思想，根本不注意旧坑木的回收和利用。有时竟把旧坑木和碎石放在碎石车里随碎石倒在山上。其次是管理制度不健全，供应和使用部门互不联系，有关人员缺乏爱护国家资财的观念，供应坑木部门又不及时了解各车间所需坑木的规格，供应的坑木不合实际需要。车间负责领坑木的人员，又不同区班长取得密切联系，领的坑木不合乎使用。在运输方面，有时当班坑木运不到，有时送错地点。使用部门遇到“大材”“长材”，就随便改小改短，截下来的木头木尾，随便装入运石车倒在山上；加上订购坑木的尺寸长短不合乎需要，护厂设备不周，因此市民可以随便进厂拿走坑木。由于以上原因，使坑木浪费现象长期存在，在国家正急需积累工业化资金的时候，我们竟对这样严重的浪费现象熟视无睹，这是不对的。
    经过这次检查同时还发现了原煤的浪费也是严重的。现在我们针对具体情况，建立了以下制度：
    关于坑木管理方面：各区每五日提出一次坑木规格备料单交供应科，每日坑木清料单，必须经区长审查后才能送交供应科。供应科应严格根据各工作面要求规格供应坑木。运输方面，凡井下存有当班坑木，必须当班送完，不准积压，收回的旧坑木也必须送达指定地点。收回的旧坑木本区能利用的必须留用，不能利用的不准装入煤石车，必须交运输转送回收坑木厂，量材利用。
    关于原煤管理方面：掘修班长按每个场子具体情况，在任务书上规定出煤量和回收坑木量，工作完后进行检查；掘修段以小组为单位，建立回收煤和回收坑木累计材料，按时公布，并进行批评表扬。煤、石头、木头必须分别装车，不得装入一车内。
    另外还规定了产品标准，做为检查质量和支付工资的根据。
    采取上述措施以后，情况已开始好转，我们今后尚须对这些制度的执行情况不断进行检查并加以改进，为彻底肃清浪费而斗争。
