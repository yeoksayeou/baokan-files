    Strengthening the Ideological and Organizational Construction of Rural Party Branches
    ——A Record of the Organizational Work Conference of the CCP Hejiang Local Committee 　 Jiang Lianchen
    Recently, the CCP Hejiang District Committee of Heilongjiang Province convened a district-wide organizational work conference. The conference focused on criticizing the tendency within the Party to neglect ideological and organizational construction and proposed specific measures to strengthen the work of rural grassroots organizations.
    Under the leadership of higher-level Party committees, the rural grassroots organizations in the Hejiang area have basically completed the Party's political and economic tasks in rural areas, ensuring the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the completion of grain purchase and requisition tasks. However, according to this inspection, many problems still exist within the grassroots organizations and among Party members.
    Some grassroots organizations in the Hejiang area cannot withstand the erosion of capitalist ideology. Various specific policies of the Party for the socialist transformation of agriculture have met with resistance within these organizations. For example, some Party members resisted the Party's policy of unified grain purchase, even engaging in speculative grain purchases and profiteering, disrupting the state's unified purchase and sales work. Some Party members did not actively participate in and lead mutual aid and cooperative organizations. More seriously, some Party members had varying degrees of exploitative behavior. According to a survey in the Second District of Yilan County, thirteen out of two hundred and thirty-five Party members had exploitative behavior.
    The organizational life in some Party grassroots organizations is very lax. Among the eleven rural branches in the Eleventh District of Fujin County, only four branches had relatively normal organizational life. Some branches only held organizational life in winter and spring and could not maintain it in summer and autumn; some branches even considered organizational life dispensable. As a result, it was impossible to fully promote inner-Party democracy, regularly carry out criticism and self-criticism, and even more impossible to promptly check the implementation of the Party's resolutions. Therefore, phenomena such as lax discipline, failure to do Party work, or failure to implement Party resolutions appeared among some Party members. In addition, some branch committees failed to conduct regular re-elections according to the Party Constitution. The thirteen rural branch committees in the Eighth District of Tangyuan County were generally re-elected during the Party rectification in 1952, but had not been re-elected for more than two years since. The long-term failure to re-elect branch committees allowed those unprogressive, ideologically degenerated and deteriorated backward elements to occupy the leading positions of the branch for a long time, weakening the leadership of the branch. Some branches cannot regularly convene Party member meetings, or cannot fully promote democracy at Party member meetings. At the Party member meetings of these branches, generally, the branch secretary and village chief (Party members) assign tasks, and Party members do not come to express their opinions, but only to "receive tasks." The branch committee, in effect, deprived Party members of the democratic right to criticism and self-criticism.
    Many branches and Party members are not clear about the Party's central task in rural areas, which reflects the low policy level of ordinary Party members. Among the eight rural branches in the Second District of Yilan, five branches were not clear about the Party's central task in rural areas. The five Party members in Qing'an Village, Qing'an Township, all said: "Production is the Party's central task in rural areas." Party members' lack of clarity about the Party's central task in rural areas also made it impossible to concentrate efforts on promoting agricultural production increases centered on mutual aid and cooperation. Qing'an Village held two Party member meetings last year, but none of them studied how to carry out the agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation. When the cooperative movement was developing rapidly, the responsible cadres in the village only calculated: "Other villages have established cooperatives, so our village should also establish cooperatives." After that, the branch did not ask about the results of establishing agricultural production cooperatives. Many Party members are not clear about the Party's fundamental line of carrying out socialist transformation in rural areas. Therefore, phenomena of discrimination and exclusion of poor peasants and infringement of the interests of middle peasants have occurred in some places. There is also a lack of vigilance against rich peasants, so that individual landlord and rich peasant elements take the opportunity to infiltrate agricultural production cooperatives and carry out various sabotage activities.
    Recently, a group of new Party members has been developed in the rural areas of the Hejiang area, but there are still some shortcomings in the work of developing new Party members. Many county and district Party committees have insufficient understanding of the importance of this work, and the plans for developing new Party members have not been completed well. Huanan County only completed 38.8 percent of its annual plan in 1954; Baoqing County completed 44.4 percent of its annual plan. Currently, many mutual aid and cooperative organizations do not have Party members, which affects the Party's leadership over the mutual aid and cooperative movement. The phenomenon of lowering the standards for Party members is also relatively serious in some areas. According to the inspection of the four district Party committees of Huanan, four of the newly developed forty-three Party members did not yet meet the qualifications of Party members.
    The conference analyzed the causes of these phenomena. The attendees unanimously believed that although these phenomena are a reflection of the current sharp class struggle within the Party, the fundamental reason is that responsible cadres in these Party organizations have an insufficient understanding of the Party's leadership role, and many county and district Party committees have an insufficient understanding of the important significance of strengthening the leadership of rural grassroots organizations. Therefore, they have neglected Party building. Some people even mistakenly believe that: "Party building work conflicts with the central work," and "Party building is the work of the organizational department." Xinfacun Village in the Third District of Tangyuan County is a base point village of the county Party committee. Because the county Party committee's leading ideology has a tendency to neglect Party building, in more than two years of base point work, it has not helped the branch, has not given play to the branch's role, and the branch in this village has gradually become paralyzed. However, the county Party committee believes that the branch is not good, which is the responsibility of the organization department, and wants the organization department to be responsible for rectification. Many Party committees, when formulating work plans and arranging various rural work tasks, do not simultaneously put forward work tasks in Party building; when checking and reporting work, they often only pay attention to the central work, and rarely study or do not mention Party building work. Some cadres believe that: "If the central work is not completed, you will be criticized, but if the Party building work is not completed, nothing will happen!"
    When the staff of many county and district Party committees go to work below, they neither go through the Party's grassroots organizations, nor guide and help the Party's grassroots organizations to work, nor educate and mobilize all Party members to lead the broad masses to complete the Party's political and economic tasks, but often take over everything, or only grasp a few Party member cadres (such as branch secretaries and village chiefs), and do not pay attention to giving play to the role of grassroots Party organizations. There is such a county Party committee member who said in a work report: "It is slower to rely on the branch to complete the task, and it is better to do it yourself." This is essentially the idea of ​​canceling grassroots Party organizations. Therefore, it must be thoroughly overcome ideologically and organizationally.
    This conference discussed how to strengthen the Party committee's leadership over rural grassroots organizations. The conference believes that: According to the provisions of Chapter 2 of the Party Constitution, "The Organizational Structure of the Party," the Party's county and district committees and the Party's rural branches are in a relationship of leadership and being led. Therefore, the county and district committees are not a question of relying on or not relying on the branch. Since the county and district committees are the leading organs of the branch, they should assign work to the branch, check the work, and help the branch discover and solve problems. At the same time, the county and district committees and grassroots organizations have different roles. The role of grassroots organizations cannot be replaced by the county and district committees. The conference requested Party committees at all levels to strengthen the leadership of the Party's grassroots organizations, first of all to strengthen the regular education of rural Party members, improve the class consciousness of Party members, and give play to the fortress role of the branch. To this end, a regular education system for branches must be established. Party committees at all levels must also strengthen the Party's organizational construction work, constantly rectify, consolidate and develop the Party's organizations, purify the Party's ranks, and increase the Party's new blood, and enhance the Party's combat effectiveness organizationally. It is necessary to form the leading core of the Party's grassroots organizations with Party members who are determined to take the socialist road and have a high level of consciousness; at the same time, those who are still unwilling to give up exploitative behavior after education should be expelled from the Party; backward Party members should be patiently educated and waited for to improve their consciousness. For class alien elements who have infiltrated the Party, they should be immediately expelled from the Party. For some relatively backward branches, more arduous and meticulous work must be carried out.
    In the work of developing new Party members, it is necessary to implement the policy of being active and cautious, and to constantly carry out communist and Communist Party education to the broad masses, constantly discover, cultivate and examine activists in practical work, and absorb activists who have already met the qualifications of Party members into the Party.
    The conference also requested Party committees at all levels to improve their leadership style and leadership methods. Party committees should regularly study and check the work of grassroots organizations on a regular basis, help them summarize their work, and exchange experiences. At the same time, while carrying out various rural work, they should pay attention to strengthening the Party's ideological and organizational construction. Of course, attention should also be paid to preventing the phenomenon of carrying out Party work in isolation from rural economic work.

### 加强农村党支部的思想建设和组织建设——记中共合江地方委员会组织工作会议

    加强农村党支部的思想建设和组织建设
    ——记中共合江地方委员会组织工作会议 　 姜连臣
    最近，中共黑龙江省合江地委召开了全区组织工作会议。这次会议着重批判了党内忽视思想建设和组织建设的倾向，并提出了加强农村基层组织工作的具体办法。
    合江地区的农村基层组织，在上级党委的领导下，基本上完成了党在农村中的政治任务和经济任务，保证了互助合作运动的发展和购粮征粮任务的完成。但是，根据这次检查，在基层组织和党员中还存在着许多问题。
    合江地区的部分基层组织，经不起资本主义思想的侵袭。党对农业实行社会主义改造的各项具体政策，在这些组织内受到了抵抗。例如有部分党员抵抗党的粮食统购政策，甚至套购粮食，投机倒把，破坏国家的统购统销工作。有部分党员不积极地参加和领导互助合作组织。更严重的是有些党员有程度不同的剥削行为。据依兰县二区调查，二百三十五名党员中，就有十三名党员有剥削行为。
    有的党的基层组织中的组织生活非常涣散。富锦县十一区十一个农村支部中，组织生活比较正常的仅有四个支部。有的支部在冬、春两季还过组织生活，到了夏季、秋季便不能坚持了；有的支部甚至认为组织生活是可有可无的。这样就不能充分发扬党内民主，经常地开展批评和自我批评，更不能及时地检查对党的决议的执行情况。因而，在部分党员中就出现了纪律松懈、不做党的工作，或不执行党的决议等现象。另有些支部的支部委员会不能根据党章规定定期进行改选，汤原县八区十三个农村支部委员会，一九五二年整党时普遍改选了一次，以后有二年多没有改选过。支部委员会长期不改选，就使那些不进步的、思想蜕化变质的落后分子长期占据了支部的领导岗位，削弱了支部的领导。有些支部不能定期召开党员大会，或者是在党员大会上不能充分发扬民主。在这些支部的党员大会上，一般是支部书记、村长（党员）布置任务，党员们不是来发表意见，只是来“领受任务”的。支部委员会在实际上剥夺了党员们批评和自我批评的民主权利。
    许多支部和党员不清楚党在农村的中心任务是什么，这反映了一般党员的政策水平很低。依兰二区八个农村支部中，就有五个支部不清楚党在农村的中心任务。庆安村庆安屯五个党员都说：“生产就是党在农村的中心任务。”党员不清楚党在农村的中心任务，也就不能集中力量搞好以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动。庆安村去年开了两次党员大会，都没有研究如何开展以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动。在合作化运动大发展时，村里的负责干部们只是核计一下：“别村都建社了，咱们村也该建社啦。”以后，建立农业生产合作社的结果如何，支部也不过问了。对于党在农村中实行社会主义改造的根本路线，许多党员都不清楚。因而有些地方便发生了歧视和排斥贫农、侵犯中农利益的现象。对富农也缺乏警惕性，以致个别地主富农分子乘机混入农业生产合作社内进行各种破坏工作。
    最近一个时期合江地区农村中发展了一批新党员，但是在发展新党员的工作中也还存在着一些缺点，不少县委、区委对这一工作的重要性认识不足，发展新党员的计划完成的不够好。桦南县一九五四年只完成全年计划的百分之三十八点八；宝清县完成全年计划的百分之四十四点四。目前许多互助合作组织中还没有党员，影响了党对互助合作运动的领导。降低党员标准的现象在某些地区也比较严重。据桦南四个区委的检查，在新发展的四十三名党员中，就有四名党员还没有具备党员条件。
    会议分析了产生这些现象的原因。到会者一致认为这些现象固然是目前尖锐的阶级斗争在党内的反映，但根本的原因还是因为在这些党组织内的负责干部对于党的领导作用认识不足、许多县、区党委对于加强对农村基层组织的领导的重要意义认识不足。因而忽视了党的建设。有些人甚至错误地认为：“党的建设工作和中心工作有矛盾”、“党的建设是组织部门的工作”。汤原县三区新发村是县委的基点村。因为县委的领导思想上存在着忽视党的建设的倾向，在二年多的基点工作中，没有帮助支部，没有发挥支部作用，这个村的支部也就逐渐瘫痪了。可是县委认为支部不好，是组织部的责任，要组织部去负责整顿。很多党委在制定工作计划和安排农村各项工作任务时，没有同时提出党的建设方面的工作任务；在检查和汇报工作时，也常常是只注意中心工作，而很少研究或不提党的建设工作。有些干部认为：“中心工作完不成受批评，党的建设工作完不成没有啥！”
      许多县委、区委的工作人员到下面工作时，既不通过党的基层组织，也不去指导和帮助党的基层组织工作，更不教育和发动全体党员带动广大群众去完成党的政治任务和经济任务，而常常是包办代替，或者只抓少数党员干部（如支部书记、村长），而不注意发挥基层党组织的作用。就有这样一个县委委员在汇报工作时说：“依靠支部完成任务慢，还不如自己干的快。”这实质上是取消基层党组织的思想。因此，必须从思想上组织上彻底加以克服。
    这次会议讨论了怎样加强党委对农村基层组织的领导问题。会议认为：根据党章第二章“党的组织机构”的规定，党的县委区委和党的农村支部是领导与被领导关系。因此县委区委对支部就不是什么依靠不依靠的问题。县委区委既是支部的领导机关，就应该给支部布置工作，检查工作，帮助支部发现问题，解决问题。同时县委区委和基层组织有不同的作用。基层组织的作用，是县委区委无法代替的。会议要求各级党委加强对党的基层组织的领导，首先要加强对农村党员的经常教育，提高党员的阶级觉悟，发挥支部的堡垒作用。为此，必须建立支部经常教育制度。各级党委还必须加强党的组织建设工作，不断地整顿、巩固和发展党的组织，纯洁党的队伍，增加党的新血液，从组织上增强党的战斗力。要把坚决走社会主义道路、觉悟较高的党员组成党的基层组织的领导核心；同时把那些经过教育仍不愿放弃剥削行为的人清除出党；对落后的党员应耐心进行教育，等待他们提高觉悟。对于混入党内的阶级异己分子，则应立即清除出党。对于部分比较落后的支部，则须进行更加艰苦细致的工作。
    在发展新党员的工作中，必须贯彻积极慎重的方针，向广大群众经常进行共产主义和共产党的教育，在实际工作中不断地发现、培养和考察积极分子，吸收已经具备党员条件的积极分子入党。
    会议还要求各级党委改进自己的领导作风和领导方法，党委应该经常地定期地研究与检查基层组织的工作。帮助他们总结工作，交流经验。同时，在进行农村各项工作的同时，都要注意加强党的思想建设和组织建设。当然，同时也要注意防止脱离农村经济工作的孤立地进行党的工作的现象。
