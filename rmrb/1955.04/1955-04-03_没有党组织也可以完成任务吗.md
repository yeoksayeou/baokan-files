Can tasks be completed without a Party organization?
Yi Huai

    Some Party organizations in industrial and mining enterprises and basic construction units do not pay attention to developing Party members. Some Party member cadres even have a very absurd argument: "Tasks can be completed without Party members," "Tall buildings can be built without Party members." The CPC Heilongjiang Hardware Factory branch in Qiqihar City is like this. Although they also formulated a plan for developing Party members, they put the work of developing Party members aside when production became busy. In 1954, this branch originally planned to develop twelve new Party members, but only developed one. The Party Committee of the Anshan Industrial Pipeline Engineering Company also has a similar situation. This Party Committee did not discuss the work of developing Party members even once last year. Once, the Organization Department of the Party Committee wanted to convene a meeting of branch secretaries to arrange the work of developing Party members, but the Party Committee Secretary did not agree. The Organization Department sometimes suggested incorporating the work of developing Party members into the Party Committee's work plan, but it was also rejected by the Party Committee Secretary.

    It is true that without Party members, and even in capitalist countries, tall buildings can be built and factories must carry out production. However, that is to build tall buildings and carry out production for the benefit of capitalists and in accordance with capitalist management principles. In our socialist state-owned enterprises, however, production must be carried out in accordance with socialist management principles and in accordance with the various guidelines and policies stipulated by the Party and the state. Who is relied upon to guarantee the implementation of socialist management principles and the various economic policies of the Party and the state? First of all, it relies on the Party organization and every Party member in the enterprise. Facts have repeatedly proved that many industrial and mining enterprises have weak Party organizations, so although these units are producing every day and tall buildings have been built, they are not operating in accordance with socialist economic principles, so many serious problems have occurred. The reason why the economic activities of many enterprises can proceed in accordance with the Party and the state's guidelines and policies is often the result of the Party organization, Party members, and various ideological behaviors that violate the Party's guidelines and policies fighting against them. Therefore, in order to ensure that the economic activities of industrial and mining enterprises are in line with the interests of the state and in accordance with the Party's guidelines and policies, it is necessary to continuously develop and improve the Party's organizations in industrial and mining enterprises.

    Of course, developing Party members in industrial and mining enterprises is not just to ensure and supervise the enterprise to do a good job in production. The Party's grassroots organizations are composed of Party members, and the Party's grassroots organizations are the bridge connecting the Party's leading organs and the masses of the people. Without grassroots organizations, it will be difficult for the Party's leading organs to connect with the masses. What's more, our Party is the political party of the working class. Therefore, it is of particularly great significance to develop and strengthen the Party's organization in the ranks of our own class and strengthen ties with the broad masses of workers and staff. Of course, those who spread the absurd argument that "tasks can be completed without Party members" and "tall buildings can be built without Party members" may not intentionally want to weaken the Party's ties with the working class and abolish the Party organization's leadership over enterprises. However, the consequences of their thinking are precisely this.

### 没有党组织也可以完成任务吗

    没有党组织也可以完成任务吗
    一槐
    有些工矿企业和基本建设单位的党组织不注意发展党员，有些党员干部甚至还有一种十分荒谬的论调，他们说：“没有党员一样可以完成任务”、“没有党员也可以盖大楼”。齐齐哈尔市中共黑龙江五金厂支部就是这样。他们虽然也订出了发展党员的计划，可是生产一忙，就把发展党员的工作扔在一边不管。一九五四年，这个支部原计划发展十二名新党员，结果只发展了一名。鞍山工业管道工程公司党委会也有类似的情况。这个党委会去年一年一次也没有讨论过发展党员的工作。有一次党委组织部想召开支部书记会议布置一下发展党员的工作，党委书记不同意。组织部有时建议把发展党员的工作列入党委的工作计划，也被党委书记拒绝了。
    不错，没有党员、甚至在资本主义国家中，大楼也是可以盖起来的，工厂也是要进行生产的。但是，那是为着资本家的利益并且按照资本主义的经营管理原则去盖大楼、去进行生产的。而在我们的社会主义国营企业中，却必须按照社会主义的经营管理原则、按照党和国家所规定的各项方针和政策去进行生产。社会主义的经营管理原则、党和国家的各项经济政策，靠谁来保证贯彻执行呢？首先是依靠企业中的党组织和每一个党员。事实已经一再证明，许多工矿企业正是因为党组织的力量薄弱，所以，尽管这些单位天天在生产、大楼也盖起来了，但是他们却不是按照社会主义经济原则办事的，所以发生了很多严重问题。许多企业的经济活动所以能够按着党和国家的方针政策进行，常常是由于党组织、党员和各种违反党的方针政策的思想行为进行斗争的结果。因此，要想使工矿企业的经济活动都是符合国家的利益、按照党的方针政策进行的，就必须不断地发展和健全工矿企业中党的组织。
    当然，在工矿企业中发展党员，还不仅仅是为了保证监督这个企业搞好生产。党的基层组织是由党员组成的，党的基层组织是党的领导机关和人民群众联系的桥梁。没有基层组织，党的领导机关和群众的联系就要发生困难。更何况，我们的党是工人阶级的政党。因此，在本阶级的队伍中发展和壮大党的组织，加强和广大职工群众的联系，就更有特别重大的意义。当然，那些散布“没有党员一样可以完成任务”“没有党员也可以盖大楼”的荒谬论调的人，也许并不是有意的要削弱党和工人阶级的联系，取消党组织对企业的领导。但是，他们的这种想法所产生的后果却正是如此。
