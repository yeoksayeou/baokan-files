    People of various ethnic groups in the Qaidam Basin, Qinghai Province, are enthusiastically supporting oil exploration work. The Haixi Mongol, Tibetan, and Kazakh Autonomous Region, at a recent enlarged meeting of its government committee, decided to organize manpower and animal power to help the exploration teams transport supplies, serve as guides and translators for the exploration teams, and supply meat such as cattle and sheep to the exploration personnel. The people of the Artyn Quke Kazakh Autonomous Region have organized a transportation team of more than 300 camels, led by Ziyahan and Yuhasibayi, members of the Autonomous Region People's Government, to go to the construction site to help with transportation.
