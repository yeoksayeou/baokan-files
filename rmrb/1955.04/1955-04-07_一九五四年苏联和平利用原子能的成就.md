Achievements of the Soviet Union in the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy in 1954
By Academician Ya. V. Topchiev of the Soviet Academy of Sciences

In 1954, Soviet scientists and engineers made significant achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy. In the area of utilizing atomic energy for power, the world's first industrial power station using atomic energy as fuel was built. The atomic power station built by the Soviet Academy of Sciences, with a capacity of 5,000 kilowatts, has been generating electricity since last summer, supplying power to industries and agriculture in neighboring areas. Construction of an atomic power station with a capacity of approximately 100,000 kilowatts is underway.

In the past year, research continued to find new ways to utilize the power generated by atomic fission. Some of this research focused on methods of directly converting atomic energy into electrical energy, while others focused on methods of converting it into electrochemical energy. Extensive research was conducted on the non-power applications of the energy generated by fissioning atoms, particularly the use of isotope radiation's penetrating and ionizing properties, and the use of isotopes as indicators in the "tracer atom" method. This work was carried out in many institutions, including the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the Academies of Sciences of the various Republics, departmental research institutes, and production organizations.

Radioactive isotopes, including radioactive cobalt, iodine, phosphorus, and sodium, have achieved great success in Soviet medical practice. Much new material has been obtained regarding the nature and mechanism of the effects of radiation from various atomic nuclei on chemical substances and chemical processes; much new material has also been obtained in the application of radiation to strengthen and stimulate important chemical processes (polymerization, oxidation, vulcanization, etc.).

Currently, the radiation from atomic nuclei is being widely used to create new and effective tools for automatic control and management of various operational processes. A series of instruments has been created that can automate many operational processes. Among these instruments, special mention should be made of radioactive measuring instruments for determining the interface between two different media [1] and various radioactive thickness gauges. These thickness gauges can be used for continuous, non-contact measurement and regulation of the thickness of metal, paper, rubber, and other strips, can be used to control the wall thickness of various metal pipes and the thickness of various material coatings, and can eliminate static electricity, etc.

Important research has been conducted on the application of nuclear radiation to the cold sterilization of food and the cultivation of high-yielding microbial types. The positive effect of radiation on the microbial biosynthesis of ergosterol (from which vitamin "D" and many other valuable chemical substances are obtained) [2] has been determined. The possibility of forming genetically stable microorganisms with a high capacity for synthesizing ergosterol under the influence of radiation has been clarified.

The tracer atom method has been widely used in the field of biology, enabling us to gain a deeper insight into the complex processes taking place in plant and animal organisms. Some novel and interesting materials have been obtained regarding the chemical processes of metabolism in brain tissue, liver, muscle, and other organs and tissues.

Soviet zoologists have applied the tracer atom method to study the effectiveness of several fish farming measures. In particular, a method for calculating fish fry in fish ponds has been developed. Large-scale experiments have been carried out to mark fish fry released from fish ponds and to calculate the number of juvenile fish after they have been released into the sea.

With the help of the same method, it has been proven that although plants are outwardly immobile, the physiological processes inside them proceed at a rapid pace. Currently, this situation makes it possible for agricultural workers to coordinate field management measures with the "speed" of plant life activities. For example, scientists have determined that the products of photosynthesis are transferred from the leaves to the roots at a speed of seventy to one hundred centimeters per hour (beets, pumpkins, and others).

With the help of tracer atoms, the pathways of formation of sucrose, nicotine, and other economically valuable substances in plant organisms have been identified.

In 1954, more than thirty Soviet scientific institutions conducted large-scale experiments with labeled superphosphate to determine more appropriate methods and dates for applying phosphate fertilizer to crops. More reliable material was obtained on the amount and rate of plant absorption of phosphate fertilizer when the fertilizer was buried at different depths and distributed differently in the soil. Material was obtained on the effect of superphosphate particle size on plants and on many other questions of practical significance for rational fertilization.

Experiments with foliar feeding of plants revealed the possibility of increasing yields by ensuring a supplementary supply of phosphorus nutrition during certain growth stages of the plant.

The tracer atom method is very effective for studying chemical reactions. In this area, valuable results have been obtained, deepening and broadening our understanding. We have studied the hydrogen exchange reaction of aldehydes and determined the laws to which these reactions are subject. The reactions of synthesis and decomposition of polyethyl compounds were studied using radioactive sulfur. The material obtained enabled us to draw conclusions about the straight-chain structure of polyethyl compounds. It is very interesting that this assumption was first put forward by D. I. Mendeleev and has been debated in the scientific community for eighty years. The application of the kinetic method of tracer atoms enables us to determine the intermediate stages of chemical reactions and to measure their rates. On this basis, the processes of oxidation of butane and cyclohexane and the thermal cracking of petroleum were successfully studied.

In technical science, the tracer atom method has been used to study the production processes of cast iron and steel, the diffusion and interatomic interaction of atoms in alloys, the strength and wear of metals and mechanical parts, and the solubility of salts in thermal installations under high temperature and high pressure, and methods for removing deposited salts. In 1954, these studies were carried out in large metallurgical, machine-building, and textile industrial enterprises, in scientific research institutes, and in factory laboratories.

In the study of theoretical and experimental nuclear physics, we organized the study of quantum theory and the theory of "elementary" particles. The results successfully eliminated certain contradictions in existing theories and overcame a series of mathematical difficulties.

In the area of cosmic rays, the main direction was to study the interaction of high-energy and ultra-high-energy protons and neutrons with atomic nuclei, and to study the nature and properties of elementary particles. The experimental work jointly carried out by the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Moscow University has largely clarified the basic situation of nuclear interactions in the high-energy region that even the most powerful modern accelerators cannot reach.

The study of unstable elementary particles that were discovered not long ago indicates the existence of new types of charged particles in cosmic rays. Their mass exceeds the mass of neutrons. Apparently, these particles differ in their stability from similar particles; those similar particles were simultaneously discovered in cosmic rays by Soviet scientists and foreign researchers, but using different methods.

In the field of beta-ray spectra and gamma-ray spectra of radioactive substances, many institutions have carried out further work to accumulate knowledge about the decay schemes of various unstable particles. In some cases, these studies have enabled us to make important generalizations, for example, the decay scheme of certain low-excited states of atomic nuclei is closely related to its decay scheme. Cerium (140), which is an atomic nucleus with a saturated neutron layer, has a particularly high energy in its initial excited state, and we have established the level scheme [3] of the cerium nucleus. This material is of great significance for determining the so-called shell theory of the atomic nucleus.

We have only cited a few individual examples of the peaceful use of atomic energy. These examples demonstrate the breadth of this work and its enormous scale. But it should be seen that we are only at the beginning of the atomic age. Year after year, atomic energy will penetrate more and more deeply into various fields of science and the national economy. Studying new methods for the peaceful use of atomic energy, and studying the problems associated with their use, is an important task for all our scientists, especially the Soviet Academy of Sciences.

Soviet scientists, who are engaged in solving the most important problems in the development of science and technology, believe that consolidating the creative connections of progressive scientists all over the world, especially the scientists of the people's democratic countries, is of great significance.

Based on the desire to promote the development of international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy, the Soviet government has expressed its readiness to disclose the scientific and technological experience accumulated by the Soviet Union and to present a report on the first industrial atomic power station at the international conference on the peaceful use of atomic energy to be convened this year as decided by the United Nations General Assembly.

The Soviet government has also made a decision to provide many countries with scientific, technological, and industrial assistance in the development of the peaceful use of atomic energy.

1954 was a year of further development and consolidation of the creative cooperation and business relations between Soviet scientists and foreign scientists.

In 1954, the Soviet Academy of Sciences sent its representatives to participate in various international scientific congresses, national congresses, conferences, and meetings. Soviet scientists went to the European People's Democratic countries, to China, to India, to France, Britain, Italy, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, West Germany, Switzerland, the United States, Pakistan, and Iran.

At the invitation of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in 1954, delegations from the Czechoslovak and Slovak Academies of Sciences, the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, the Damascus Arab Academy of Sciences and the Albanian Scientific Research Institute, a group of Indian scientists, a delegation of Norwegian scientific workers, and a delegation of British historians visited the Soviet Union. The exchange of books and periodicals with foreign academies of sciences, universities, scientific research institutes, scientific societies, libraries, etc. has greatly developed. For example, in 1954, the Soviet Academy of Sciences sent more than 350,000 copies of books and magazines abroad for exchange. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the government, and the entire Soviet people have entrusted their scientists with extremely important tasks. Soviet scientists are using all their energy, experience, and knowledge to fully promote the development of science and technology for the happiness of the people and for the victory of communism. The instigators of a new war openly announced their sinister plans to use atomic weapons against peace-loving people. This provocation against humanity has aroused a flame of anger in all honest people. The forces of peace and progress will unite to prevent the threat of atomic war and to make the greatest discoveries of human wisdom benefit the people. It is the sacred duty of scientists to ensure that atomic energy and all scientific achievements are used not for war and destruction, but for peace and construction.

Notes:
[1] Interface between different media - Objects can usually be divided into three categories: gas, liquid, and solid. Between objects in different states (such as gas and liquid), there is a definite boundary that divides them, which is called the interface between different media. In industry, it is often necessary to determine where the interface between different media is located in a sealed reaction chamber (or boiler). For example, in high-temperature, high-pressure steam boilers, it is often necessary to know where the interface between water and steam is located.
[2] Ergosterol: Ergosterol is a plant sterol that can produce vitamin "D" when irradiated with ultraviolet light.
[3] Nuclear energy level - An atomic nucleus can usually have different energies, but its energy can often only be certain fixed values, not arbitrary ones. The different values of energy possessed by an atomic nucleus are called nuclear energy levels. When the atomic nucleus is at a level higher than its lowest energy level (i.e., when it carries the smallest amount of energy), it is said that the atomic nucleus is at its initial excited state; when the atomic nucleus is at a level slightly higher than its lowest energy level, it is said that the atomic nucleus is at its low-excited state.

    一九五四年苏联和平利用原子能的成就
    苏联科学院院士  亚·维·托普切夫
    一九五四年内，苏联的科学家和工程师在和平利用原子能方面获得了重大的成就。在原子能的动力利用方面，建成了世界上第一座利用原子能作为燃料的工业电力站。苏联科学院所建造的功率为五千瓩的原子能电力站，从去年夏天起就已经开始发电，并把电流供给邻近地区的工业和农业。一座功率约为十万瓩的原子能电力站的建设工作正在进行。
    在过去的一年中，继续研究了寻找利用原子分裂所产生的动力的新途径。其中的一些是把原子能直接转变为电能的方法的研究，另一些是把它转变为电化学能的方法的研究。广泛地进行了对于分裂中的原子所产生的能力的非动力利用的研究，特别是利用同位素放射线的穿透性能、电离性能的研究，利用同位素作为“示踪原子”方法中的指示剂的研究。这些工作是在苏联科学院、各加盟共和国科学院、各部门的研究所和生产机构中的许多机关中进行的。
    包括放射性钴、碘、磷、钠在内的放射性同位素，在苏维埃医学实践上已经取得巨大的成绩。在各种原子核的放射线对于化学物质、化学过程所产生的作用的性质和机构方面，已经获得了许多新的材料；在应用放射线于强化和激发重要的化学过程
  （聚合作用、氧化作用、硫化作用等等）方面，也已经获得许多新的材料。
    目前正在广泛地应用原子核的放射线，来创造新的自动控制和管理多种多样操作过程的有效工具。已经创造出一系列可以使许多操作过程自动化的仪器。在这些仪器中，特别要提到的是测定两种不同介质分界面〔一〕的放射性测量仪和各种放射性厚度测量仪，利用这种厚度测量仪可以对金属、纸、橡皮等带子的厚度进行连续的但不直接接触被测量物的测量和调节，可以用来控制金属管子的各种管壁和各种材料覆盖的厚度，以及使静电荷消失等等。
    在应用原子核放射性于食品的冷消毒和培育多产的微生物类型方面进行了重要的研究。已经确定了放射线对微生物生物合成麦角固醇（由这一产品获得维生素“丁”和许多其他珍贵的化学物质）〔二〕的积极作用。弄清楚了在放射线影响下形成遗传性上巩固的、具有高度合成麦角固醇能力的微生物的可能性。
    示踪原子的方法在生物学领域里获得了广泛的运用，它使我们得以更深入地洞察动植物有机体内进行的复杂过程。在大脑组织、肝脏、肌肉及其他器官和组织中新陈代谢的化学过程方面已获得了某些新颖有趣的材料。
    苏维埃动物学家在研究若干养鱼措施的效能方面应用了示踪原子的方法。特别是研究出了在鱼池中计算鱼苗的方法，大规模地进行了把从鱼池中放出的鱼苗带上标记，并且在把它们放入海中以后计算幼鱼的试验。
    在同样的方法帮助下，证明了植物尽管在外表上是固定不动的，但是在它内部的生理过程却是以很快的速度来进行的。目前，这种情况使农业工作者有可能把植物的田间管理措施同植物生命活动的“速度”配合起来。例如，科学家已经确定了，光合作用的产品是以每小时七十到一百公分的速度
  （甜菜、南瓜和其他）从叶子向根部转移的。
    在示踪原子的帮助下，蔗糖、烟碱及其他经济上珍贵的物质在植物有机体内形成的途径已经查明了。
    在一九五四年，有三十多个苏联科学机构大规模地进行了带有标记的过磷酸钙的试验，来确定对农作物施用磷肥的更适宜的方法和日期。获得了在肥料埋在不同深度和在土壤中不同分布的情况下植物吸收磷肥的数量和速度的更为可靠的材料。获得了关于过磷酸钙颗粒大小对植物的影响以及关于其他许多对合理施肥有实际意义的问题的材料。
    通过植物根外追肥的试验，发现在植物的一定生长时期中保证补充供应以磷素营养从而提高产量的可能性。
    示踪原子的方法对于研究化学反应是非常有效的。在这个领域中，已经获得了很有价值的结果，加深和扩大了我们的认识。我们研究了醛类的氢交换的反应，并且确定了这些反应所服从的规律性。利用放射性硫研究了多乙基化合物的合成和分解的反应。所获得的材料使我们能够做出关于多乙基化合物的直链结构的结论。非常有趣的是，这个假定是德·伊·门捷列夫第一个说出来，而且是八十年来在科学界一直争论着的。应用示踪原子的动力学方法可以使我们确定化学反应的中间阶段和测量它们的速度。在这个基础上，顺利地研究了丁烷、环己烷的氧化和石油热裂的历程。
    在技术科学上，曾经用示踪原子的方法来研究生铁和钢的生产过程，研究合金中原子的扩散和原子间的相互作用，研究金属和机械零件的强度和磨损，研究在高温、高压下热工装置中盐的溶解度和移去沉积盐的方法。在一九五四年，这些研究已经在巨大的冶金、机械制造、纺织工业的企业，在科学研究所和工厂实验室中进行。
    在理论的和实验的原子核物理的研究方面，我们组织了量子理论和“基本”粒子理论的研究。结果很成功地消除了现存理论中的某些矛盾和克服了一系列的数学上的困难。
    在宇宙线方面的工作，主要的方向是研究高能和超高能的质子和中子与原子核的相互作用，和研究基本粒子的本性和性质。苏联科学院和莫斯科大学共同进行的实验工作，已经在很大的程度上阐明了甚至是最强大的现代加速器所不能达到的高能领域内原子核相互作用的基本情况。
    对于不久以前所发现的不稳定基本粒子的研究，指示出在宇宙线中存在着新型的带电粒子。它们的质量超过中子的质量。显然，这些粒子在它们的稳定性方面和类似的粒子是有区别的；那些类似的粒子曾被苏维埃科学家和外国研究者在宇宙线中同时发现，但是所用的方法是不同的。
    在放射性物质的乙种射线谱和丙种射线谱的领域方面，许多机关进行了进一步积累关于各种不稳定粒子蜕变略图的知识的工作。在某些情况下，这些研究使我们做出了重要的概括，例如，某些原子核的低激态的略图和它的蜕变的略图是密切相关的。铈（一四○）是具有饱和中子层的原子核，它的初激态具有特别高的能量，而我们已经建立了铈原子核能级〔三〕的略图。这些材料对于确定所谓原子核的壳理论是有重要意义的。
    我们只是举出了和平利用原子能的一些个别例子。这些例子证明了这个工作的广泛和它的巨大规模。但是应当看到，我们还只是处在原子时代的开端。原子能是要年复一年愈来愈深地渗透到各种科学和国民经济的领域中去的。研究原子能和平利用的新方法，以及研究与它们的利用相联系的那些问题，是我国所有科学家特别是苏联科学院的重要任务。
    正在从事解决科学技术发展中最重要问题的苏联科学家，认为巩固和全世界进步科学家，首先是人民民主国家科学家的创造性的联系，有重大的意义。
    基于促进在和平利用原子能方面发展国际合作的愿望，苏联政府曾表示准备在联合国大会所决定在今年内召开的和平利用原子能的国际会议上，公开苏联所积累的科学、技术经验和提出关于第一个工业原子电力站的报告。
    苏联政府还作出了给予许多国家在发展和平利用原子能方面以科学、技术和工业上的帮助的决定。
    一九五四年是进一步发展和巩固苏联科学家同外国科学家之间创造性的合作和事务上联系的一年。
    在一九五四年，苏联科学院派遣了自己的代表去参加各种国际科学代表大会、全国代表大会、代表会议和会议。苏联科学家到了欧洲人民民主国家，到了中国，到了印度，到了法国、英国、意大利、奥地利、比利时、荷兰、西德、瑞士、美国、巴基斯坦和伊朗。
    应苏联科学院的邀请在一九五四年访问苏联的，有捷克斯洛伐克和斯洛伐克科学院、保加利亚科学院、大马士革阿剌伯科学院和阿尔巴尼亚科学研究所的代表团，一批印度科学家，挪威科学工作者代表团和英国历史学家代表团。和外国的科学院、高等学校、科学研究所、科学团体、图书馆等的书刊交换，有了很大的发展。例如，一九五四年苏联科学院寄往国外参加交换的书籍和杂志在三十五万份以上。苏联共产党、政府和全体苏联人民把极重要的任务交给了自己的科学家。苏联科学家正在运用自己的全部精力、经验和知识，为了人民的幸福、为了共产主义的胜利，全力促进科学技术向前发展。新战争的挑拨者公然宣布了它们利用原子武器来反对爱好和平人民的罪恶计划。这个对人类的挑衅，激起了全体正直人们愤怒的火焰。和平和进步的力量将团结一致，来预防原子战争的威胁，来使人类智慧最伟大的发现为人民谋幸福。科学家的神圣职责，是使原子能以及全部科学成就，不是用于战争和破坏，而是用于和平和建设。（本报特约稿）附注：〔一〕不同介质分界面——物体通常可以分为三类，即气体、液体和固体。在不同状态下的物体之间（如气体和液体），有一定的界限把它们划分开，这就叫做不同介质的分界面。在工业中，常常需要测定在密封了的反应室（或锅炉）中不同介质的分界面究竟在什么地方。例如，在高温、高压的蒸汽锅炉中常需要知道水和蒸汽的分界面究竟在何处。〔二〕麦角固醇：麦角固醇是一种植物性固醇，经紫外线照射后能产生维生素“丁”。〔三〕原子核能级——一颗原子核通常可以具有不同的能量，但它的能量常常只能是某些固定的数值，而不是任意的。原子核所具有能量的不同数值就叫做原子核能级。当原子核处在比它最低一层能级（即所带能量是最小的时候）高一级的时候，就称原子核是处在它的初激态上；当原子核处在比它最低一层能级略高几级的时候，就称原子核是处在它的低激态上。（附图片）
