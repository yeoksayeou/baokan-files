Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 1st: As the returning troops of the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) left the Korean border city of Sinuiju, they received a warm send-off from the Korean people.

On March 31st, as the train carrying the vanguard of the CPV returning troops slowly pulled into Sinuiju Station, thousands of Korean people on the platform waved flags and bouquets, shouting "Peace," "Friendship," and "Long Live."

At approximately 9:00 AM (Pyongyang time), people from all walks of life in Sinuiju held a farewell ceremony at the station for the returning troops of the CPV. Li Chude, Secretary-General of the Sinuiju Committee of the Korean Democratic Fatherland Front, delivered a farewell speech on behalf of the people of Sinuiju. He extended warm gratitude and high respect to the returning troops of the CPV. He said, "I believe that we will surely achieve even more brilliant successes in the construction of our respective homelands and in our efforts to further consolidate peace in Asia and the world." Wang Tieman, the representative of the vanguard of the CPV returning troops, delivered a farewell speech. He said that the just struggle of the Korean people for peaceful reunification will always have the support of the Chinese people. The people of China and Korea will always stand closely together to fight against our common enemy—the American aggressors, to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world.

After the farewell ceremony, the representatives of the CPV returning troops waved goodbye to the Korean people who were seeing them off and boarded the train.
