    We Should Teach Them Working Methods
　　Sang Ke
    Currently, quite a few rural Party branches have indeed recognized the importance of the Party's leadership over agricultural producers' cooperatives. However, this does not mean that these branches have all strengthened their leadership over agricultural producers' cooperatives. The example of the Yanshan Town Party Branch in Guiding County, Guizhou Province, abandoning leadership over the agricultural producers' cooperative fully illustrates this problem. Yanshan Town established a "Forward Agricultural Producers' Cooperative" in October last year. At that time, the Yanshan Town Party Branch also believed that it should strengthen the branch's leadership over this agricultural cooperative, and shouted loudly about "launching an agricultural production increase campaign centered on mutual aid and cooperation." However, in actual practice, it was still the same – focusing on one thing when the work was pressing, and isolating that one thing. When the unified purchase and supply work came, the branch isolated itself to do the unified purchase and supply work; when the work of recruiting and replenishing soldiers came, the branch isolated itself to do the work of recruiting and replenishing soldiers. They took care of the east but couldn't take care of the west, and for a long time, they did not pay attention to the agricultural producers' cooperative. As a result, problems arose within the cooperative, and no one dealt with them. Obviously, if this continued to develop, the "Forward Agricultural Producers' Cooperative" would not only fail to move forward but might even collapse.
    Situations like that of the Yanshan Town Party Branch are not isolated cases today.
    How should we resolve the contradiction between current work and leading agricultural producers' cooperatives? Of course, we can say this to the rural branches: only by doing a good job in the unified purchase and supply of grain can we promote the consolidation and development of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and only by relying on agricultural producers' cooperatives can we better complete the task of unified purchase and supply of grain. The two are not contradictory but are completely consistent. However, simply using this to conduct "political education" for the branches will not achieve any results. They may even answer you like this: "What you say is very beautiful, please show us how to do it!" This is easy to understand. Because today, the leadership level of many rural branches is not high, and their leadership experience is not much; although they admit the importance of the Party's leadership over agricultural cooperatives and recognize the consistency between current work and leading agricultural producers' cooperatives, this only solves the problem of ideological understanding, and there is still a distance between specifically realizing the leadership over agricultural cooperatives and closely combining current work with leading agricultural cooperatives. Therefore, while solving the problem of ideological understanding, we must also pay attention to solving the problem of working methods. Otherwise, strengthening the branch's leadership over agricultural producers' cooperatives is just empty talk.
    This reminds the county and district Party committees that, in addition to conducting ideological education for rural Party branches, they must also teach them working methods, that is, specifically helping them to study the situation, arrange work, tell them, and show them, so that they can learn the ability to do a good job in all current rural work around the agricultural cooperation movement.

    应当教给他们工作方法
　　桑柯
    目前，确实有不少的农村党支部，已经认识到党对农业生产合作社领导的重要意义。但是，这并不等于说，这些支部都已经加强了对农业生产合作社的领导。贵州省贵定县沿山镇党支部放弃领导农业生产合作社的例子，就充分地说明了这个问题。沿山镇在去年十月建立了一个“前进农业生产合作社”。当时，沿山镇党支部也认为应当加强支部对这个农业社的领导，并口口声声喊着“要开展以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动”。但是，实际做起来的时候，却仍然是那样工作紧，就孤立地抓那一样。统购统销工作来了，支部就孤立地去搞统购统销工作，征集补充兵员的工作来了，支部就孤立地去搞征集补充兵员的工作。顾了东，顾不了西，长期不去过问农业生产合作社。因此，社内发生的问题，无人处理。显然，照这样继续发展下去，“前进农业生产合作社”不但不能前进，而且还可能垮台。
    像沿山镇党支部这样的情况，在今天还不是个别的。
    应当怎样解决当前工作和领导农业生产合作社的矛盾呢？当然，我们可以这样对农村支部讲：只有做好粮食统购统销工作，才能促进农业生产合作社的巩固和发展，只有依靠农业生产合作社，才能更好地完成粮食统购统销任务。两者不矛盾，是完全一致的。但是，仅仅用这去对支部进行“政治教育”，是不会获得什么效果的。他们甚至会这样回答你：“你们讲的很漂亮，请做给我们看看吧！”这是很容易理解的。因为，今天许多农村支部的领导水平还不高，领导经验还不多；他们虽然承认党对农业社领导的重要，认识到当前工作和领导农业生产合作社的一致性，但这只是解决了思想认识问题，而和具体实现对农业社的领导，把当前工作和领导农业社密切结合起来，中间还有一段距离。因此，在解决思想认识问题的同时，还要注意解决工作方法问题。否则，加强支部对农业生产合作社的领导，只不过是一句空话。
    这就提醒了县区党委，除了对农村党支部进行思想教育以外，同时还必须教给他们工作方法，即具体地帮助他们研究情况，安排工作，讲给他们听，做给他们看，使他们学会围绕农业合作化运动做好当前各项农村工作的本领。
