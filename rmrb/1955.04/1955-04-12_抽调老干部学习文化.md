    Drawing Veteran Cadres to Study Culture
    In order to systematically improve the cultural and scientific knowledge of veteran cadres, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to transfer 250 veteran cadres with lower levels of education at or above the district committee level from their posts to study at the Hunan Provincial Administrative College and cadre cultural supplementary schools in Hengyang, Shaoyang, Changde, and other places in the first half of this year.
    Starting in early March, these students have already begun to register at the schools. These students have mostly been tested by long-term revolutionary struggles and have a correct understanding of the significance of this study, so their enthusiasm for learning is very high. Currently, these schools are beginning to administer tests for class placement. These comrades will generally improve to the cultural level of junior high school graduates within one to two years.

    抽调老干部学习文化
    为了有计划地提高老干部的文化水平与科学知识水平，中共湖南省委决定今年上半年抽调二百五十名文化程度较低的区委级以上的老干部，离职到湖南省行政学院和衡阳、邵阳、常德等地干部文化补习学校学习。
    三月初起，这些学员已经开始到校报到，这些学员大都经过长期革命斗争的考验，对这次学习的意义有正确的认识，因而学习情绪很高。目前这些学校正开始测验编班。这些同志一般将在一年到二年的时间内提高到初中毕业的文化程度。
