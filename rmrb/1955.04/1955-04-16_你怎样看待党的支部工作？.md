How Do You View Party Branch Work?
Li Yan

Currently, in our Party life, there is still an abnormal phenomenon: some Communist Party members are unwilling to do or disdain to do branch work. This situation exists in the Beijing School for Financial Cadres. Every time this branch holds re-elections, some Party members are afraid of being elected as branch committee members. If they are not elected, they consider it lucky; if they are elected, they see it as a burden. One comrade who was elected as a branch committee member even complained: "In the future, I must never fill in any Party positions I have held on forms again, otherwise, branch work will be thrust upon me. This is a lesson learned!" Such "lessons learned" are, of course, absurd. However, this shows how abnormal the reluctance of a few Party members to do branch work is.

Some Communist Party members, after being elected as branch committee members, often push the position of branch secretary back and forth, unwilling to accept it. For example, a deputy director of the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Culture was like this. The branch committee nominated him to be the branch secretary, but he refused to accept it. The branch committee spent six hours and held three meetings for this, but he still refused to accept it. What was the reason given by this deputy director? "The Party sent me here to do administrative work, not branch work." Obviously, this deputy director was mistaken. The Party sent him to the Bureau of Culture to serve as deputy director, which is certainly to do administrative work; but the Party certainly did not mean that he should not also do branch work at the same time. As for whether he wants to do branch work or not, it is not a question of whether the Party assigns him, but rather whether the Party members of this branch elect him. Moreover, doing a good job of branch work in the Bureau of Culture is precisely the guarantee of doing a good job of administrative work in the Bureau of Culture. There is no contradiction between the two, but rather a close relationship. How can they be put in opposition to each other?

Some who are elected as branch committee members not only lack the enthusiasm they should have for their work, but also lack the most basic sense of responsibility. They simply do not care about the work of the branch committee, and even avoid attending branch committee meetings. This is an even more common phenomenon.

Being elected as a branch committee member should mean that one is trusted by all the Party members of the branch, and this trust is worth cherishing and must be cherished by the elected Party members. To belittle branch work is, in fact, to belittle the role of the Party organization. This is, of course, completely wrong. All Party members who are elected as branch committee members should only work diligently and strive to do a good job of branch work, just like doing other work assigned by the Party. There is absolutely no reason to refuse to do branch work; if anyone refuses to do branch work, they should be asked: How do you view the Party's work? Are you a Communist Party member?

### 你怎样看待党的支部工作？

    你怎样看待党的支部工作？
    黎言
    目前，在我们党的生活中，还存在着这样一种不正常的现象：有些共产党员不愿意做或者不屑于做支部工作。北京财政干部学校就有这种情况。这个支部每次改选，都有一些党员怕自己被选为支部委员。如果没选上，认为是侥幸；如果选上了，看作是负担。一个当选为支部委员的同志竟然因此大发牢骚：“以后在表上再也不能填写自己担任过什么党内职务了，否则，支部工作就会压到自己头上来，这是一条经验教训啊。”这样的“经验教训”当然是荒谬的。但是，这可以说明少数党员不愿做支部工作的情绪是多么不正常的了。
    有的共产党员在当选支部委员以后的分工中，往往又把支部书记这一职务推来推去，不愿接受。比如天津市文化局的一位副局长就是这样。支部委员会推选他担任支部书记，他拒不接受，为此，支部委员会花了六个钟头，开了三次会，结果他还是拒不接受。这位副局长的理由是什么呢？“党派我来是做行政工作的，不是做支部工作的。”显然，这位副局长弄错了，党派他到文化局担任副局长固然是做行政工作的；但党绝没有不要他同时也做支部工作的意思，至于他要不要做支部工作，不是党派不派他的问题，而是看这个支部的党员选举不选举他的问题。而且，文化局支部工作做好了，正是文化局行政工作做好的保证，这中间没有矛盾，而是紧密关联的，怎么能把它们对立起来呢？
    有些当选为支部委员的，对自己担负的工作不仅缺乏应有的工作热情，而且还缺乏最起码的责任感。他们根本不关心支部委员会的工作，甚至连支部委员会的会议都避不参加。这更是常见的现象。
    被选为支部委员的，应该说，是受到支部全体党员信任的，这种信任是值得当选的党员珍惜和必须珍惜的。轻视支部工作，事实上就是轻视党组织的作用。这当然是完全错误的。所有被选为支部委员的党员只有兢兢业业，努力做好支部工作，像做好党所分配的其他工作一样。而决没有拒绝做支部工作的理由；如果有谁拒绝做支部工作，就应该问他：你对待党的工作究竟是怎样看法？你是不是共产党员？
