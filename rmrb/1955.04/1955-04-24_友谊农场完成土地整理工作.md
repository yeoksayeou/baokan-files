    Friendship Farm Completes Land Consolidation Work
    The land consolidation personnel of the state-owned Friendship Farm have buried the last batch of intra-farm zoning markers, and the draftsmen have developed the last on-site construction completion map. Thus, the land consolidation work carried out by the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture Land Consolidation Survey Team to help our country build the state-owned Friendship Farm has been successfully completed.
    On the 22nd, the workers of the Friendship Farm bid farewell to the experts of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture Land Consolidation Survey Team in Xinglong Town. On the 23rd, the experts took a train from Fulitun to Harbin. They will finalize the land consolidation work-related data in Harbin, and then report to our Ministry of Agriculture in Beijing. They will also donate all the working instruments they brought from Moscow to our country.
    The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture Land Consolidation Survey Team, led by Comrade Maslov, arrived at the site—the Sandao Gang Grassland—on November 13, 1954. In the harsh winter, the experts conducted continuous field surveys for two months. In mid-January of this year, the land consolidation work shifted to indoor work. While sorting out the field survey materials, the Soviet experts squeezed out time to write lecture notes and lectured at the land consolidation training class held in Harbin, systematically imparting advanced experience and theories about land consolidation work to land consolidation personnel from all over our country. In early April, the Soviet experts returned to the site again to carry out intra-farm zoning work, and at the same time, combined this work to specifically guide some students from the land consolidation training class in on-site practice. In this way, the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture Land Consolidation Survey Team not only successfully completed the land consolidation work of the Friendship Farm, laying a good foundation for the establishment and development of the Friendship Farm, but also helped our country train the first batch of land consolidation talents.

    友谊农场完成土地整理工作
    国营友谊农场的土地整理人员已经埋下最后一批场内区划标桩，绘图员已经洗晒好最后一张现场施工竣工图。至此，苏联农业部土地整理考察组为帮助我国建成国营友谊农场而进行的土地整理工作，已经胜利完成。
    二十二日，友谊农场的职工在兴隆镇欢送了苏联农业部土地整理考察组的专家们。二十三日，专家们从福利屯乘火车赴哈尔滨。他们将在哈尔滨对土地整理工作有关资料进行最后清理，然后到北京向我国农业部汇报工作。他们还将把从莫斯科带来的全部工作仪器赠送给我国。
    以马斯洛夫同志为首的苏联农业部土地整理考察组，在一九五四年十一月十三日到达场地——三道岗草原。在严寒的日子里，专家们连续进行了两个月的野外勘测工作。今年一月中旬，土地整理工作转入室内工作。苏联专家们一面整理野外调查材料，一面挤出时间编写讲义，为在哈尔滨举办的土地整理讲习班讲课，把先进的关于土地整理工作的经验和理论系统地传授给来自我国各地的土地整理人员。四月初，苏联专家们再度返回场地，进行场内区划工作，同时结合这项工作具体指导土地整理讲习班一部分学员进行了现场实习。这样，苏联农业部土地整理考察组不仅胜利地完成了友谊农场的土地整理工作，给友谊农场的建立和发展打下了良好的基础，还帮我国训练了第一批土地整理人材。　（本报驻福利屯记者）
