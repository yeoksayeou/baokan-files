Jiangsu Silk Reeling Workers Complete First Quarter Task

The silk reeling industry in Jiangsu Province overfulfilled its first-quarter production quota for various high-grade silks six days ahead of schedule.

In order to meet export needs, Jiangsu Province's silk factories increased their 1955 high-grade silk production target by more than five times compared to 1954. The first quarter's high-grade silk production tasks were relatively heavy for the silk factories, but the raw materials were of lower quality. To overcome difficulties and complete the tasks, the silk factories universally strengthened technical leadership and production management, promoted advanced experiences, and tapped the potential of raw materials. Finally, through the efforts of all staff and workers, they shattered the notion that "only when new silkworms are on the market is it the golden age for silk reeling factories." By March 25, the province had overfulfilled the first quarter's production target for various A-grade and above high-grade silks. In particular, thanks to the efforts of the workers in various silk factories, more than ten metric tons of rare 4A-grade silk were reeled. Currently, the staff and workers of many silk factories are working hard to complete the second quarter's high-grade silk production tasks. (Our correspondent in Nanjing)

    江苏缫丝工人完成第一季任务
    江苏省缫丝工业提前六天超额完成了第一季度各种高等级丝的生产任务。
    江苏省各缫丝厂为了适应出口需要，一九五五年的高等级丝生产任务比一九五四年增加五倍多。各丝厂第一季度高等级丝的生产任务比较繁重，但是原料较差。各缫丝厂为克服困难，完成任务，普遍加强了技术领导和生产管理，推广先进经验，发挥了原料的潜在能力，终于在全体职工的努力下，打破了“只有新蚕上市，才是缫丝厂的黄金时代”的说法，到三月二十五日止，全省第一季度A级以上各种高等级丝的生产任务已超额完成。特别是在各丝厂工人的努力下，缫出了十多公担稀有的四A级丝。目前，许多缫丝厂的职工正在为完成第二季度高等级丝生产任务而努力。（本报驻南京记者）
