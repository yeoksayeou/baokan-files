    The Story of Over 400,000 Jin of "Rotten" Corn
    By Our Reporter Liu Xi
    The peasants of the Twelfth District of Dading County, Guizhou Province, all believe: "There will be no difficulty with rations during this year's spring plowing." They have suggested many solutions, one of which is the story of how the district cadres led them to deal with the rotten corn.
    The story is as follows.
    In 1954, there was a lot of rain, and a lot of corn rotted in this area. During the autumn harvest, Xue Juming, the district party secretary, went to assist the Changshan Agricultural Production Cooperative in its autumn harvest distribution work. He found that the cooperative members were throwing away corn with some moldy kernels everywhere, and no one cared. These corn kernels became more and more moldy and would soon become waste. Xue Juming picked up an ear of corn from the ground, poked it, looked at it, and asked everyone, "What are you going to do with this corn?" Some cooperative members said, "There is moldy corn every year. Anyway, we have a good harvest, so we don't rely on this little bit." It turned out that the cooperative members thought that production had been increasing year after year, so they didn't lack food. They were also busy with work, so they didn't care about the moldy corn.
    Xue Juming felt that this was a serious problem when he heard this. According to the situation of the Changshan Agricultural Production Cooperative, such corn accounted for 5% of the total harvest, and the total for the entire district was more than 400,000 jin! What a huge number! If they watched those good corn kernels rot, how much harm would it do to the peasants and the country? That night, Xue Juming held an enlarged meeting of the cooperative's management committee to discuss how to deal with the rotten corn. Some cooperative members said, "Just throw it away, so as not to infect the good corn." Female cooperative member Lan Xurong criticized the cooperative for not cherishing the rotten corn. She said, "Our family has a weak foundation. We have only been doing a little better for the past two years. It is wrong to only care about the present and not the future." Xue Juming picked up on this and said, "What Lan Xurong said is right! If we waste a grain of food, we increase our difficulties by one point." Everyone felt that what he said made sense, and they all advocated feeding the bad corn to the pigs. The good corn kernels should be removed and quickly ground into flour to steam粑粑 (baba, a type of cake or bread).
    The next day, some cooperative members removed corn kernels and ground flour. Experienced farmers also suggested that corn flour should be mixed with "red seeds" (a type of wild plant fruit), which is nutritious and delicious. After steaming and eating a meal, someone suggested adding scallions and salt. As a result, the steamed粑粑 became more and more delicious each time.
    Xue Juming introduced the Changshan Agricultural Production Cooperative's method of dealing with rotten corn at the district cadre meeting. In order to make all the peasants in the district cherish food and seize the time to deal with the rotten corn, the meeting decided to convene a mutual aid and cooperation representative meeting to conduct education and mobilize the masses to visit the Changshan Agricultural Production Cooperative. Li Shengmin, an Yi ethnic district cadre, also went to the Changshan Agricultural Production Cooperative to buy one hundred jin of corn, gathered a lot of "red seeds," and steamed粑粑 all night with Xue Juming, so that the representatives attending the mutual aid and cooperation representative meeting could taste whether the steamed粑粑 mixed with "red seeds" was delicious or not, and whether it would be a pity to waste it? The representatives tasted it and said:
  "Very good." Some took three, some took two. After returning, the matter quickly spread throughout the villages. Every household removed corn kernels, ground flour, and went up the mountains to gather "red seeds." In this way, more than 400,000 jin of "rotten" corn in the entire district were processed without waste, and more than two hundred dan of "red seeds" were harvested. In addition to human consumption, the pig feed problem was also solved.

    四十多万斤“烂”苞谷的故事
    本报记者　刘希
    贵州省大定县十二区的农民都相信：“今年春耕期间的口粮没有困难。”他们说出了许多办法，其中有一件是区干部领导他们处理烂苞谷的故事。
    事情是这样的。
    一九五四年雨水多，这一带的苞谷烂了不少。秋收期间，区委书记薛巨明去协助长山农业生产合作社进行秋收分配工作时，发现社员们把一些霉烂了一部分苞谷粒子的苞谷，丢的各处都是，也没人心疼。这些苞谷粒子越霉烂越多，很快就要变成废物。薛巨明从地下拾起一个苞谷，掏了掏，看了看，问大家：“这些苞谷你们准备怎么处理呢？”有些社员说：“年年都有霉烂的苞谷，反正丰收了，也不靠这点子。”原来社员们认为连年增产，不缺粮食；更加活路忙，就没有把这些霉烂的苞谷放在心上。
    薛巨明听了这话，认为这是个严重问题。按照长山农业生产合作社的情况计算，这样的苞谷占全部收获量的百分之五，全区加起来就有四十多万斤，这是好大的数字！要是眼看着那些好苞谷粒子也霉烂了，对农民和国家的危害多大。那天晚上，薛巨明在社里召开了社务管理委员会扩大会议，讨论如何处理这些烂苞谷的问题。有的社员说：“干脆把它丢掉，免得传染了好苞谷。”女社员兰修荣批评了社里不爱护烂苞谷的现象。她说：“我们家底子薄，这二年刚好了一点，就只顾眼前，不管将来是不对的。”薛巨明接过去说：“兰修荣说的对！我们浪费一粒粮食，就增加一分困难。”大家觉得这话说的很有理，都主张把坏了的苞谷喂猪。好苞谷粒子脱下来，赶快磨成面子蒸粑粑吃。
    第二天，有的社员脱苞谷粒子，磨面子。有经验的农民又建议，苞谷面子掺“红籽”（一种野生植物的果实），有营养、又好吃。蒸了一顿吃了，又有人提议，在里面放葱和盐巴。结果，蒸的粑粑一次比一次好吃。
    薛巨明在区干部会议上介绍了长山农业生产合作社处理烂苞谷的办法。为了使全区农民爱惜粮食，抓紧处理烂苞谷，会上决议召开互助合作代表会议进行教育，发动群众到长山农业生产合作社参观。彝族区干部李胜民还到长山农业生产合作社买了一百斤苞谷，打了不少的“红籽”，和薛巨明蒸了一夜粑粑，让参加互助合作代表会议的代表们都尝一尝掺“红籽”蒸的粑粑好吃不好吃，浪费了可惜不可惜？代表们一尝，都说：
  “很好。”有的拿三个、有的带两个，回去后，这件事很快就在各乡传开了。家家户户脱苞谷粒子，磨面子、上山打“红籽”。这样一来，全区四十多万斤“烂”苞谷都处理了，没有浪费掉，还收了二百多石“红籽”，除了人吃，猪的饲料也解决了。
