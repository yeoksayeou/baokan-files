Xinhua News Agency report: The British Industrial and Commercial Trade Mission issued a statement before leaving Beijing. The statement pointed out that in the past two weeks, the delegation signed several contracts with China National Import and Export Corporation and various state-owned import and export corporations, and exchanged general opinions on the needs and supply possibilities of the two countries, which will lead to a substantial expansion of Sino-British trade after the delegation returns home.

The statement continued: "Negotiations were not limited to trade issues and also touched on broader aspects. For example, both parties agreed in principle that when trade further expands, the exchange of technical personnel would be possible if necessary. Both parties also felt that mutual visits should continue.

"Negotiations were conducted in a very harmonious atmosphere, and both parties felt that face-to-face contact was mutually beneficial. Some British businessmen had visited Beijing in the past, and this time they strengthened their old ties."

When talking about the prospects for the development of trade between China and Britain, the statement believed:

"There are obstacles preventing the possibility of full development of trade between the two countries." The statement pointed out that import and export trade between China and Britain "will be further developed once normal trade relations are restored."

Mr. Fascist-Yate, the representative of British Arthur Balfour Company, which exports steel, told reporters: "As long as there are no trade restrictions, the prospects for Sino-British trade are very broad. Because China is carrying out industrial construction, it needs to expand trade. The more your industry expands, the more business we can do with you."

Xinhua News Agency report: The second British Industrial and Commercial Trade Mission organized by the Sino-British Trade Council left Beijing by train on the morning of April 16th via Shanghai to return home after a two-week visit to Beijing.

The delegation conducted trade negotiations with China National Import and Export Corporation and relevant import and export corporations in Beijing, signed several specific contracts, and extensively explored the possibility of developing Sino-British trade under normal conditions. The delegation also visited several factories in China and exchanged views with people in China's trade circles on general issues of Sino-British trade, reaching a consensus.

On the evening of the 15th, the British Industrial and Commercial Trade Mission attended a farewell banquet hosted by Cao Zhongshu, Acting Manager of China National Import and Export Corporation.

    英工商界贸易访问团离京回国并发表声明
    据新华社讯　英国工商界贸易访问团在离京回国前发表声明。声明指出在过去二周内，访问团同中国进出口公司和各国营进口和出口公司签订了若干合同，交换了关于两国需要与供应可能性的一般意见，这将会导致访问团返国后中英贸易的大量扩展。
    声明接着说：“商谈不仅限于贸易问题并且也接触到更为广泛的一些方面，例如双方曾在原则上同意当贸易进一步扩展后如有必要时交换技术人员是可以的。双方并感到应继续进行相互访问。
    “谈判始终在极和谐的气氛中进行，双方并感到当面接触是互相有利的。英国的一部分商人过去曾访问北京，这次又重新加强了旧有联系。”
    在谈到中英两国贸易发展前途时，声明认为：
  “由于存在着障碍阻止了两国贸易充分发展的可能性。”声明指出中英两国间的进出口贸易“在一旦正常贸易关系恢复后将得到进一步的发展。”
    访问团团员、经营出口钢材的英国阿瑟巴尔福公司的代表法西斯亚特向记者说：“只要没有贸易限制，中英贸易的前途是很广阔的。因为中国正在进行工业建设，所以它需要扩大贸易。你们的工业越扩展，我们和你们的生意也就可以做得更大。”
    据新华社讯　由中英贸易委员会组织的第二次英国工商界贸易访问团在北京作了两星期的访问后，大部分团员在四月十六日晨乘火车离北京经上海返国。
      访问团在北京同中国进出口公司、各有关进口和出口公司分别进行了贸易谈判，签订了若干具体合同，广泛地探讨了在正常状态下发展中英贸易的可能性。访问团还参观了中国的若干工厂，并和我国贸易界人士就中英贸易间的一般性问题交换了意见，取得了一致的看法。
    十五日晚，英国工商界贸易访问团出席了中国进出口公司曹中枢代经理的欢送宴会。
