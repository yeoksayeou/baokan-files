Special Care Funds Should Not Be Stockpiled or Misappropriated
Li Fangyuan

The state allocates a sum of special care funds from the national treasury every year to effectively help the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers to solve difficulties in production and life, and to assist them in participating in mutual aid and cooperative production and establishing their families. This amount is very large, exceeding 100 million yuan in 1954 alone.

In recent years, especially in 1954, many places have distributed special care funds according to the principle of planned and focused use, and have achieved good results. For example, in 1954, Handan County, Hebei Province, extracted more than 13,000 yuan from the special care fund to purchase 44 head of cattle, more than 700 pigs, and more than 29,000 jin of fertilizer to help the families of revolutionary martyrs and the families of servicemen smoothly engage in production. Among the 75 families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen who received livestock, 53 participated in mutual aid groups and 7 participated in agricultural production cooperatives. In the second half of 1954, the Vice Governor of Shandong Province presided over a meeting of county heads from old revolutionary base areas to arrange the work of using special care funds. The meeting decided to extract 7.03 million yuan from the 10.03 million yuan of in-kind subsidies for families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen as a special fund to support their production, with 3 million yuan specifically used to solve the living difficulties of families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen who lacked labor power and were poor. After the meeting, the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs dispatched cadres to form working groups to go deep into the townships to assist in the work. By the end of February this year, this work had been basically completed, helping approximately 60,000 poor families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen to solve the difficulties of production materials such as livestock and farm tools. In the five counties and 771 townships of the Jiaozhou Special District, among the 31,221 families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen, those who originally lacked production materials and needed subsidies accounted for 20.14 percent. After receiving subsidies from the special care fund and overcoming the difficulties of production materials, many households participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. According to statistics, the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen who originally participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations accounted for only 59.8 percent of the total number of families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen, but this has now increased to 79 percent. The families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen, etc., who have solved their production and living difficulties with the help of special care funds deeply feel the government's care and concern for them, and are able to actively engage in production. The families of servicemen encourage their husbands or children to work even better. After receiving in-kind subsidies, 198 families of servicemen in five districts of Yiyuan and Liangshan counties wrote letters to the front lines, telling their loved ones about the government's care and encouraging them to make new contributions to the people.

However, some areas have not made good use of the special care funds, or even stockpiled and misappropriated them, because they do not have a sufficient understanding of the important significance of distributing the special care funds, or subjectively believe that the special care work in their areas has already been done and there is nothing more to do. This has led to the long-term failure to solve the production and living difficulties of families of revolutionary martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers, causing them pain and damaging the work.

For example, there are many families of revolutionary martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers in Anhui Province, and they have suffered from disasters for many years. Special care funds should have been used well to help them solve their actual difficulties. In 1954, Anhui Province had more than 11.8 million yuan of special care funds, but the province allocated more than 3.5 million yuan for purposes unrelated to special care work as soon as it started last year. Wuwei County suffered from floods last year, but nearly 30,000 yuan of special care funds were stockpiled and not distributed in time, resulting in serious phenomena such as families of revolutionary martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers selling their cattle and housing materials, fleeing from famine, and abandoning infants. The 46 families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen in Xinhe Township of the county had only three head of cattle, all of which were sold. The 14 families of demobilized construction soldiers had 29 rooms' worth of housing materials, but due to living difficulties, they had already chopped nine rooms' worth of housing materials into firewood and sold them. The Guanzhen Township People's Government did not use special care funds to solve the living difficulties of families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen, but instead introduced Lin Zhao's family, a serviceman's family, to find the troops in Hebei Province. Lin Zhao's family ran out of travel expenses in Bengbu City and was in a dilemma. The Qianqiao District of Hudong County misappropriated 102 yuan of special care funds to repair the district chief's dormitory.

Many counties in Hubei Province suffered from floods last year, and the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen also had many difficulties in production and life. However, the province misappropriated 1.36 million yuan of special care funds. In 1954, Huangpi County in the province had 63,821 yuan of special care funds, but 25,000 yuan was stockpiled, while the living difficulties of families of revolutionary martyrs, families of servicemen, and demobilized construction soldiers could not be solved. Henan Province also misappropriated 1.57 million yuan of special care funds in 1954. Some county cadres even embezzled special care funds.

The phenomenon of stockpiling, misappropriating, and embezzling special care funds is not only happening in Anhui, Hubei, and other places, but also in other provinces and cities, although the degree varies. For example, Lianjiang County in Guangdong Province subsidized rural cadres who were semi-detached from production with 300 yuan of special care funds. Tangshan Special District in Hebei Province stockpiled more than 1 million yuan of special care funds. Stockpiling, misappropriating, and embezzling special care funds have brought many difficulties to the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen and have caused a very bad influence among the masses. However, these serious lessons have not aroused sufficient attention and vigilance in various places, and there are still incidents of misappropriating special care funds happening in 1955. It is understood that Zhejiang Province has already misappropriated 1.07 million yuan, accounting for nearly one-quarter of the annual special care funds, Heilongjiang Province misappropriated 550,000 yuan, and Jilin Province misappropriated 510,000 yuan. It is wrong to fail to solve the difficulties of families of revolutionary martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers and to misappropriate special care funds for other purposes, and it must be corrected quickly.

The situation of using special care funds in many places shows that two different practices will inevitably produce two different results. The interests of the state and the people require us to use this fund correctly and not allow stockpiling, misappropriation, and embezzlement. In order to correctly distribute special care funds, all localities should conduct investigations and research, effectively grasp the production and living conditions of families of revolutionary martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers, and distribute them separately according to the actual situation. Special care funds must be neither stockpiled, misappropriated, or embezzled, nor blindly and indiscriminately distributed, causing waste.

    优抚事业费不应积压和挪用
    李芳远
    国家为了有效地帮助烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人解决生产和生活上的困难，每年都从国库中拨出一笔优抚事业费，作为扶助他们参加互助合作生产和建立家务之用。这笔款项的数字很大，仅一九五四年就有一亿多元。
    几年来，特别是一九五四年，许多地方都根据有计划有重点地集中使用的原则，发放了优抚事业费，收到了很好的效果。例如，河北省邯郸县一九五四年从优抚事业费中抽出一万三千多元，买了四十四头耕牛、七百多头毛猪、两万九千多斤肥料，扶助烈属、军属顺利地投入生产。领到牲畜的七十五户烈属、军属中，有五十三户参加了互助组，七户参加了农业生产合作社。一九五四年下半年，山东省副主席主持召开了老革命根据地的县长会议，布置使用优抚事业费的工作。会议决定从烈属、军属实物补助费一千零三万元中抽出七百零三万元作为扶助烈属、军属生产的专款，以三百万元专用于解决没有劳动力的和贫苦的烈属、军属的生活困难。会后，省民政厅抽调干部组成工作组，深入到乡协助工作。到今年二月底，这项工作已基本完成，共帮助约六万户的贫苦烈属、军属解决了牲畜和农具等生产资料的困难。胶州专区五个县七百七十一个乡三万一千二百二十一户烈属、军属中，原来缺乏生产资料需要补助的占百分之二十点一四，他们得到优抚事业费的补助，克服了生产资料的困难以后，很多户都参加了互助合作组织。据统计，原来参加互助合作组织的烈属、军属只占烈属、军属总户数的百分之五十九点八，现在已增加到百分之七十九。得到优抚事业费补助而解决了生产和生活困难的烈属、军属等，深深感到政府对他们的关怀和体贴，都能积极生产，军属并鼓励自己的丈夫或子弟要更好地工作。沂源、梁山两县的五个区的军属在受到实物补助后，有一百九十八户都向前方写了信，把政府的关怀告诉了自己的亲人，鼓励自己的亲人为人民建立新的功劳。
    但是有些地区因为对发放优抚事业费的重要意义还认识不足，或是主观地认为本地区的优抚工作已经做好，再没有什么可做，因而没有很好地使用优抚事业费，甚至积压、挪用，使烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人的生产和生活上的困难问题长期得不到解决，给他们造成了痛苦，给工作造成了损害。
    例如安徽省烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人较多，又连年遭灾，原应很好地使用优抚事业费，帮助烈属、军属等解除实际困难。一九五四年安徽省共有优抚事业费一千一百八十多万元，但该省在去年刚刚开始，就拨出三百五十多万元用在同优抚工作无关的方面。无为县去年遭了水灾，但是将近三万元的优抚事业费却被积压下来，没有及时发下，以致发生了烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人出卖耕牛、房料和逃荒、弃婴等严重现象。该县新河乡四十六户烈属、军属只有三头耕牛，也全卖掉了。十四户复员建设军人有二十九间房料，因为生活困难，已经把九间房料劈成木柴卖掉。官镇乡人民政府不用优抚事业费解决烈属、军属的生活困难，反把军属林赵氏介绍到河北省去找部队，林赵氏到了蚌埠市就没了路费，进退两难。湖东县钱桥区则挪用优抚事业费一百零二元修了区长的宿舍。
    湖北省去年有许多县遭受水灾，烈属、军属的生产和生活方面也有不少困难，而该省也竟挪用了优抚事业费一百三十六万元。该省黄陂县一九五四年优抚事业费是六万三千八百二十一元，有两万五千元都被积压下来，而烈属、军属、复员建设军人的生活困难却得不到解决。河南省在一九五四年内也挪用优抚事业费一百五十七万元。有些县的干部还贪污了优抚事业费。
    积压、挪用和贪污优抚事业费的现象不仅在安徽、湖北等地发生，其他的省市也有，虽然程度各有不同。如广东省廉江县就把三百元优抚事业费补助给半脱离生产的乡村干部了。河北省唐山专区积压了一百多万元的优抚事业费。积压、挪用、贪污优抚事业费，给烈属、军属带来了很多的困难，在群众中造成了很坏的影响。但这些严重的教训还没有引起各地的足够重视和警惕，就在一九五五年仍有挪用优抚事业费的事件发生。据了解：浙江省即已挪用一百零七万元，占全年优抚事业费的四分之一弱，黑龙江省挪用五十五万元，吉林省挪用五十一万元。烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人的困难未得到解决，而把优抚事业费挪做他用，是不对的，必须迅速纠正。
    许多地方使用优抚事业费的情况说明了，两种不同的做法必然产生两种不同的结果。国家和人民的利益都要求我们必须正确地使用这笔款项，而不能允许积压、挪用和贪污。为了正确地发放优抚事业费，各地应该通过调查研究，切实掌握烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人的生产和生活情况，根据实际情况，分别发放。优抚事业费必须做到既不积压、挪用、贪污，也不盲目滥发，造成浪费。
