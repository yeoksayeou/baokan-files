In Sichuan Basin, it is now a warm and sunny season, and the newly planted mulberry trees have begun to sprout on the green hillsides. Sichuan Province is one of the major silkworm areas in China. In accordance with the province's plan to increase mulberry leaf production by 10% this year, silkworm farmers throughout the province have been actively carrying out planting and protecting mulberry trees since the beginning of spring. At present, more than 10 million mulberry trees have been planted in various places, completing more than half of the planting plan. In Danleng County alone, silkworm farmers in eight townships have planted 400,000 new mulberry trees using the vacant land on the hillsides. In order to cultivate the mulberry trees well, many silkworm farmers, under the guidance of local sericulture technicians, have carried out pruning, pest control, and fertilization. The silkworm farmers of Lianhua Township in Junlian County carefully brushed the trunks of the mulberry trees with lime slurry for the first time, pruned the branches, and applied water and fertilizer. In Hechuan County, members of the Sifang Agricultural Production Cooperative, in addition to pruning and controlling pests on all the mulberry trees in the cooperative, applied more than 20 kilograms of fertilizer to each tree, and signed a contract with the local sericulture technical guidance station to jointly guarantee a 20% increase in mulberry leaf production. The silkworm farmers were excited to hear that silk could be exchanged for a large number of machinery and equipment from abroad, and they said excitedly: "We must respond to the government's call, plant more mulberry trees, raise more silkworms, and support the country's industrial construction!"

    四川农民积极栽桑护桑
    四川盆地目前正是暖和晴朗的季节，翠绿的山坡上，新栽的桑树已经开始发芽了。四川省是我国主要蚕区之一。全省蚕农们按照今年全省增产桑叶百分之十的计划，入春以来，积极开展了栽桑、护桑工作。现在各地已经栽好桑树一千多万株，完成栽桑计划一半以上。仅丹棱县八个乡的蚕农，利用山坡空隙的土地，就新栽桑树四十万株。为了把桑树培育好，许多蚕农在当地蚕桑技术人员的指导下，进行了修枝、除虫和施肥等工作。筠连县莲花乡的蚕农们第一次仔细地用石灰浆刷了桑树干，修整了树枝，上了水肥。合川县四方农业生产合作社的社员们除对社内全部桑树进行修枝和除虫外，给每株树上了二十多斤肥料，并且同当地蚕桑技术指导站签订了合同，共同保证增产桑叶百分之二十。蚕农们听说用蚕丝能从国外换回大批机器设备，都兴奋地说：我们一定响应政府的号召，多栽桑，多养蚕，支援国家工业建设。（本报驻重庆记者）
