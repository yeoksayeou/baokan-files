Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th - TASS reports from Moscow on the 5th: Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov received U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Charles Bohlen, on the 4th and issued him a statement regarding the detention of a sixteen-year-old Soviet student, Valery Lisikov, by the American military authorities in Berlin.

The statement said: Valery Lisikov is a ninth-grade student at a Soviet secondary school in Berlin. He had previously shown signs of personality disorder. He failed geometry this semester and left school on March 18th. He did not return home, ended up in the American sector, and was detained by representatives of the American authorities. Five days after his disappearance, the military commander of the American occupation zone in Berlin notified the Soviet authorities, claiming that Valery Lisikov had requested "political asylum" from the American authorities.

On March 26th, Valery's parents met with their son in the American sector of Berlin. An American official "representing" him read a statement requesting "asylum," but Valery remained silent about the statement and said he wanted to go home, but he was afraid.

The statement said: It is noteworthy that the American authorities in Berlin are trying to turn this matter into a political event, claiming that student Valery does not want to return to his parents for political reasons. The American authorities are portraying student Valery as some kind of "political figure," arranging "press conferences" for him, and organizing broadcasts on this issue from Bonn, London, and Washington.

The statement specifically mentioned that the requests made by the Soviet authorities in Germany for Valery Lisikov to have the opportunity to return to his parents were ineffective; and according to newspaper reports, Valery has been transferred from Berlin to Frankfurt am Main, and there are already reports that he is being sent to the United States.

The statement said: The child's parents have requested the Soviet government to take the necessary measures to protect the interests of their underage son and to enable him to return home. This entire case is arousing the legitimate indignation of Soviet men and women. The Soviet government draws the attention of the United States government to the necessity of intervening in this matter in order to return Valery Lisikov to his parents.

Ambassador Bohlen said that he would immediately report this statement to his government.

    莫洛托夫接见美驻苏大使波伦
    就柏林美当局扣留一苏联少年事发表声明
    新华社六日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科五日讯：苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫于四日接见了美国驻苏联大使查尔斯·波伦，并就柏林美国军事当局扣留一个十六岁的苏联学生瓦列里·利西科夫的事情向他发表了声明。
    声明说：瓦列里·利西科夫是柏林一个苏联中等学校九年级的学生。他以前已经表现出性格失常，本学期他几何学没有及格，在三月十八日离开学校以后就没有回家，落到了美占区，被美国当局的代表们加以扣留。在他失踪之后五天，柏林美国占领区军事司令官才通知苏联当局，硬说瓦列里·利西科夫要求美国当局给予他“政治避难”。
    三月二十六日，瓦列里的父母在柏林美占区内同他们的儿子会了面，一个美国官员“代表”他宣读了一篇要求“避难”的声明，但是瓦列里却对这篇声明保持缄默，而说他想回家，只是他不敢。
    声明说：值得注意的是柏林美国当局正在企图把这件事变成一个政治事件，硬说好像学生瓦列里是由于政治上的原因不希望回到他的父母那里去。美国当局正把学生瓦列里说成好像是某种“政治人物”，给他安排“记者招待会”，而且还从波恩、伦敦和华盛顿组织关于这个问题的广播。
    声明特别提到，在德国的苏联当局提出的关于给瓦列里·利西科夫回到他的父母那里去的机会的要求没有发生效果；而据报纸的消息说，瓦列里已经从柏林被送到美因河畔法兰克福，而且已经有消息说他正在被送往美国。
    声明说：这个孩子的双亲已经请求苏联政府采取必要的措施来保障他们的尚未成年的儿子的利益并使他回家。整个这个案件正激起苏维埃男女的正当的愤慨。苏联政府提起美国政府注意，必须干与这件事，以便把瓦列里·利西科夫送回到他的父母那里。
    波伦大使说，他将立刻把这个声明报告他的政府。
