    Benxi Coal Mine Should Immediately Correct the Tendency of Wasting Raw Coal

To the Editor:

    The phenomenon of losing and wasting raw coal has long existed in the Benxi Coal Mine, but no one has paid attention to it. According to incomplete statistics from the Surveying Department of Benxi Coal Mine, at least 71,200 tons of raw coal were lost in the four mining areas of the entire mine in 1954 alone. If all losses are combined, it is estimated to be around 140,000 tons. What an alarming figure! The reasons for the loss and waste are: firstly, the loss of top and bottom plate coal and floating coal in empty roadways is very serious. In the West Third Lane, Second Connection of the First Mining Area, from November 1st to 25th, 1954, the raw coal thrown on the coal transport road averaged 0.45 meters thick per day. Secondly, the indiscriminate loading of coal and stone is also one of the main reasons for coal loss. During mining, workers only focus on speeding up the progress, mixing coal and stones together, and then dumping them in the slag yard above ground. Approximately 15 tons of raw coal are lost every day due to the indiscriminate loading of coal and stone. From June to December 1954, citizens selected 771 tons of raw coal from this slag yard. Thirdly, due to insufficient or untimely supply of railcars, the raw coal cannot be transported out in time, so workers throw it in empty roadways or stuff it in stone walls.

    Most of the coal loss occurs in areas where the strata changes or the coal seam is too thin. Because in such cases, grassroots cadres and workers, fearing that they will not be able to complete their quotas, rush to meet the cycle and strive to advance the roadway further to get their basic wages (the wage quotas were not reasonably adjusted at any time in these circumstances), and are unwilling to thoroughly recover the top and bottom plates and clean up the floating coal in the empty roadways. This coal is either left in the empty roadways or used as stones to fill stone walls by the workers who build the walls, resulting in serious waste.

    The mine's leadership does not pay enough attention to resource management. Although there was a surveying and mapping section in the first half of 1954, there was no inspection and acceptance system for recovery. Although the Geology Department and Surveying Department were established in the second half of 1954, and some systems for strengthening recovery management were formulated, the leadership did not seriously implement them. For example, in February of this year, a small rock layer containing 173 tons of coal was discovered in the middle of the safety coal pillar in the West Sixth Lane, First Connection, Large Working Face of the First Area, but the workers in the mining area were afraid of not meeting the production quota and did not recover it. At that time, the geological surveying personnel believed it was recoverable. In the event of a dispute between the two parties, Chen Guangjin, the production mine manager, said, "Just throw it away then!" As a result, it was still thrown away. As such, the serious coal loss phenomenon in this mine has not been curbed.

    I suggest that the leading comrades of Benxi Coal Mine seriously study the situation and causes of coal loss, formulate a practical and effective plan for improvement, and thoroughly correct this tendency of wasting raw coal.

### 本溪煤矿应即纠正浪费原煤的偏向

    本溪煤矿应即纠正浪费原煤的偏向编辑同志：
    本溪煤矿长期存在着丢失和浪费原煤的现象无人过问。根据本溪煤矿测量科的不完全统计，光是一九五四年全矿四个采煤区就丢失原煤至少有七万一千二百吨。如果把所有的损失合起来，估计有十四万吨左右。这是一个多么惊人的数字！造成丢失和浪费的原因：首先是顶底板丢采和空巷浮煤的丢失情况很严重。第一采煤区西三道二接，在一九五四年十一月一日到二十五日，平均每天扔在运煤道上的原煤就有零点四五公尺厚。其次，煤、石不分装也是造成丢煤的主要原因之一。采煤时，只顾赶进度，把煤和石头混装在一起，然后丢在井上的翻碴场里。由于煤、石不分装所丢失的原煤每天约有十五吨左右。市民们从一九五四年六月到十二月，在这个翻碴场上选出的原煤就有七百七十一吨。第三，车皮供应不足或不及时，原煤不能全部及时地运出，工人就将它扔在空巷中或塞在石垛里。
    丢煤多半发生在地层有变化或煤层过薄的地方。因为在这样情况下，基层干部和工人，怕完不成定额，就去赶周期，争取多进巷，好拿到基本工资（遇到这种情况时，工资定额并未随时合理调整），而不愿彻底回采顶底板和打扫空巷浮煤。这些煤被丢在空巷里，或被打后垛的工人当做石头填了石垛，造成了严重的浪费。
    这个矿的领导上对资源管理工作是不够重视的。一九五四年的上半年矿里虽然有个测绘股，但对回采根本没有检查验收制度。一九五四年下半年虽然成立了地质科和测绘科，也制定了一些加强回采管理的制度，但领导上并没有认真地贯彻。如今年二月，一区西六道一接大掌子，在保安煤柱中间发现有藏煤一百七十三吨的小岩层，可是采区职工怕达不到生产定额，就不去回采了。当时地质测量人员认为可采。在双方争执不下的情况下，生产矿长陈光进说：“扔就扔点吧！”结果还是扔掉了。这样，这个矿的严重丢煤现象一直没有得到制止。
    我建议本溪煤矿的领导同志认真地研究一下丢煤的情况和原因，订出切实有效的改进工作计划，彻底纠正这种浪费原煤的偏向。
