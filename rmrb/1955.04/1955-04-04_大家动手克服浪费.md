Everyone Take Action to Overcome Waste
Gong Lei

After criticisms were launched across various regions regarding extravagance and the pursuit of formalism in construction, many units revised designs with wasteful elements that had not yet commenced construction. For projects already underway, certain superfluous structures and decorations were reduced. Projects in the planning stages had their investment plans compressed in accordance with the spirit of frugality. Completed projects were inspected, lessons were drawn, and vigilance for the future was emphasized. These practices are correct and timely.

Overcoming extravagance and formalistic tendencies is not an easy task. It is not something that can be "solved" by shouting a few "oppose" or "down with" slogans. Rather, it requires a thorough examination and criticism of the thinking that causes waste, thereby establishing socialist architectural thought. Only in this way can construction be fully beneficial to the country's construction efforts and to the people's material and cultural lives. However, ideological struggle requires a process, and some construction projects with serious waste are still under construction. If we shut ourselves off to examine our thinking without considering the situation of the projects, wouldn't we still be wasting a lot of money? Therefore, all construction units and architects are required to take action first, and go all out to examine and reduce all unnecessary investments in construction. By doing so, a lot of money can be saved for the country.

The joint office building of the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of the First Machine Building Industry, the Ministry of the Second Machine Building Industry, and the State Planning Commission had various wastes in the two auxiliary buildings totaling approximately 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. The Housing Construction Committee responsible for building this building accepted this lesson and reduced a large roof and unnecessary decorations on the main building under construction, resulting in a saving of 200,000 yuan. The dormitory being built by the Wuhan Real Estate Administration Bureau has a total budget of 1.39 million yuan. Among them, many unnecessary structures and decorations were designed in pursuit of architectural form, and the cost reached 290,000 yuan, accounting for more than 20% of the total cost. Now, after making modifications to certain places, more than 159,000 yuan can be saved. This shows that as long as we earnestly overcome waste, we can see immediate results.

We must not underestimate the effect of this action. If all construction units and architects across the country take immediate action in this spirit, the money saved will be considerable. In order to guarantee this economic effect, we must oppose various departmentalism practices. For example, some people hold an "get by" attitude, wanting to avoid this "gust of wind," and then do the same as before; some are seizing the time to rush the construction period, planning to conduct a post-completion review together; or use the money saved from construction to buy furniture, etc., unwilling to return the money in hand to the state. These practices are extremely wrong. Everyone should despise them.

    大家动手克服浪费
    巩磊
    各地对建筑中铺张浪费、追求形式的现象展开批评后，许多单位修改了尚未动工的有浪费现象的各种设计；已经动工的工程，也削减了某些虚假的结构和装饰；正在计划的，根据节约精神压缩了投资计划；对已经竣工的工程，进行了检查，从中吸取教训，警惕今后。这种做法是正确的、适时的。
    克服铺张浪费和形式主义倾向，不是一件容易的事。不是高呼几个“反对”或“打倒”就可以“万事大吉”的，而是需要对造成浪费的思想进行深入的检查、批判，从而树立起社会主义的建筑思想。这样才能使建筑完全有利于国家建设事业、有利于人民的物质和文化生活。但是，思想斗争需要有一个过程，而某些有严重浪费现象的建筑工程又正在施工，如果我们闭起门检查思想，不问工程情况，那不是还要浪费许多金钱吗！因此，要求所有建筑单位和建筑师首先行动起来，全力以赴地检查和削减一切建筑中不必要的投资。能这样做，便可为国家节省很多钱。
    地质部、重工业部、第一机械工业部、第二机械工业部和国家计划委员会的联合办公大楼，两座副楼的各种浪费共约五十万至六十万元。修建这个楼的房屋建设委员会接受了这个教训，把正在建筑的主楼上的一个大屋顶和不必要的装饰减掉了，结果节省二十万元。武汉市房地产管理局负责建筑的宿舍正在施工中间，预算总造价是一百三十九万元，其中因追求建筑形式而设计了许多不必要的结构、装饰，其费用达二十九万元，占总造价百分之二十以上。现在，对某些地方作了修改，即可少花十五万九千多元。这说明只要我们认真地去克服浪费，就可立见功效的。
    我们绝不能小看这一行动的效果。如果全国所有的建筑单位和建筑师都本着这种精神立即行动起来，节省下来的钱一定会是很可观的。为了保证这一经济效果，就要反对各种本位主义的做法：例如有人抱着“过关”的态度，想躲过这
  “阵风”，而后照样干；有的是抓紧时间赶工期，打算完成后一块来个事后检讨；或者把从建筑上省下来的钱，用去买家具等，不愿意把拿到手的钱再交还国家。这些做法都是极端错误的。大家都应该唾弃他们。
