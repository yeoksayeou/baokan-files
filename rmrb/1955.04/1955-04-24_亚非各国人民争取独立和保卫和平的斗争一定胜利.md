The people of Asian and African countries have a long history and culture, but for a long time, due to the constant plunder and oppression by colonialists, many countries in Asia and Africa have been in a state of poverty and backwardness.

Since World War II, the face of the Asian and African regions has undergone profound and historic changes. The people of many countries in Asia and Africa have shaken off and are shaking off the shackles of colonialism. However, there are still many countries in Asia and Africa whose people continue to suffer from the enslavement and plunder of colonialists. Certain Asian and African countries are being used as military bases by aggressive blocs headed by US imperialism, threatening the peace of Asia, Africa, and the world.

Now the broad masses of people in Asia and Africa are fighting for the complete elimination of imperialist rule and plunder in the Asian and African regions. Opposing colonialism and racial discrimination, demanding national independence and freedom, opposing imperialist aggression and war, and resolutely safeguarding the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of their own countries have become the common program of the awakened Asian and African people's struggle. The era in which imperialism arbitrarily manipulated the fate of the Asian and African people is gone forever. The struggle of the Asian and African people for independence and defense of peace is developing vigorously and is gaining the sympathy and support of the broad masses of people around the world.

The opening of the Asian-African Conference vividly demonstrates the common aspirations and demands of the 1.6 billion Asian and African people, who account for more than half of the world's population, for striving for national independence, resolutely safeguarding peace, and strengthening friendly cooperation among Asian and African countries.

The aggressive actions of US imperialism to transform Japan into a military base have been strongly resisted by the Japanese people. The struggle against the US military's establishment of a mountain warfare training school and the construction of training grounds on Mount Myogi in Gunma Prefecture, Japan, which began in early 1953, has been victorious with the support of the people and trade union organizations throughout Japan. The people of Gunma Prefecture, Japan, held a celebration rally and demonstration on March 19 this year, expressing their determination to continue the struggle against the establishment of military bases by the US military in Japan.

The Indian people are widely launching a peace movement to oppose imperialist aggression and war preparations. This year, the All-India Conference for Peace and Asian Solidarity was held in Madras, India. After the meeting, a grand peace demonstration was held with the participation of 50,000 people. Representatives from all over India and citizens and workers of Madras held up banners saying "US troops get out of Taiwan" to oppose the US occupation of China's territory of Taiwan.

The broad masses of Indonesian people are fighting against colonialists to recover West Irian and abolish the economic and financial clauses in the Round Table Conference Agreement. This is a scene of Indonesian youth holding demonstrations against colonialists.

The people of Burma unanimously demand the prohibition of the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons and condemn the United States for continuing to instigate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops to invade Burma. This is a scene of Burmese youth holding a peace demonstration in Rangoon.

The broad masses of the people of Pakistan, together with the people of India and Southeast Asian countries, are carrying out unremitting struggles against the colonial system and demanding national independence. This is a scene of youth in Karachi, the capital of Pakistan, holding demonstrations to oppose the organization of military blocs and demand peace.

The people of Ceylon held a mass meeting in Matara to support world peace and oppose aggression.

The people's armed forces of Malaya are growing stronger in the war against the colonialists and are constantly striking at the bloody rule of the colonialists. This is a contingent of the Malayan National Liberation Army fighting for national independence.

The broad masses of Iranian people resolutely oppose imperialist plunder and demand the abolition of the privileges of foreign monopoly companies and the protection of national resources and sovereignty.

Egyptian students held demonstrations demanding the withdrawal of foreign troops and the recovery of the Suez Canal Zone.
