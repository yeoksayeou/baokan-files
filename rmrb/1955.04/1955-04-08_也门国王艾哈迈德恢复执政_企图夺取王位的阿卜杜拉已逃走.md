Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 6th (TASS dispatch): According to newspaper reports, the conspiracy for a coup in Yemen has failed. Abdulla, who attempted to seize the throne, has been forced to flee Yemen. He was the person who led the coup orchestrated by imperialist countries.

According to the "Republic" newspaper, Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser received a telegram on the 5th from Badr, the son of Yemen's King Ahmed. The telegram stated that the conspiracy had been eliminated and that Ahmed had restored power in the country.

A special correspondent for "Al-Ahram" reported from Aden that Ahmed was freed from being besieged in the palace by his son Badr, who gathered eight thousand tribal troops loyal to the king under his command. The correspondent reported that Abdulla is now seeking refuge in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia.

It can be seen from newspaper reports that the conspiracy for a coup in Yemen was launched in the interests of imperialism. Ahmed does not advocate Yemen's participation in imperialist blocs, and he supports Egypt's proposal to establish a new organization for military and economic cooperation among Arab countries to counter the Turkish-Iraqi pact.

"The Republic" wrote that the British radio station "Shack-al-Adna" on Cyprus had supported the coup in its broadcasts, saying that Abdulla was "a supporter of Yemen joining pacts concluded by the West."

    也门国王艾哈迈德恢复执政
    企图夺取王位的阿卜杜拉已逃走
    新华社七日讯　塔斯社开罗六日讯：据报纸消息，在也门进行政变的阴谋已经失败了。企图夺取王位的阿卜杜拉已被迫逃出也门，他是领导帝国主义国家所策动的政变的人。
    据“共和国报”报道，埃及总理纳赛尔五日收到也门国王艾哈迈德的儿子巴达尔的一封电报，这封电报说，阴谋已被消灭，艾哈迈德已在国内恢复执政。
    “金字塔报”特派记者自亚丁报道，使被围在皇宫里面的艾哈迈德获得自由的，是他的儿子巴达尔，巴达尔召集了八千名忠心于国王的部落军队归自己指挥。记者报道，阿卜杜拉现正在沙特阿拉伯的首都利雅得寻找避难所。
    从报纸消息中可以看出，也门政变的阴谋是为了帝国主义的利益而发动的。艾哈迈德是不主张也门参加帝国主义集团的，他并支持埃及关于建立同土耳其—伊拉克条约相抗衡的新的阿拉伯国家军事和经济合作组织的建议。
    “共和国报”写道，英国在塞浦路斯岛上的电台“斜克—阿尔—阿德纳”在广播中曾支持政变，并说阿卜杜拉是“拥护使也门参加西方所缔结的公约的人”。
