    Jiangsu Province has planned to survey 1,637,000 mu of wasteland this year in preparation for large-scale wasteland reclamation and the planned development of state-owned farms in the next few years. Most of these wastelands are distributed on the coastal plains of northern Jiangsu Province, with concentrated areas suitable for mechanized farming. In the coastal areas of Dongtai and Dafeng counties, there are approximately 610,000 mu of large tracts of wasteland. Generally, the wasteland areas are around 50,000 mu, and the smallest are above 10,000 mu.
    The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has established a specialized survey organization, equipped with agricultural, soil, water conservancy, and surveying technical personnel. The Ministry of Agriculture has also allocated a special fund of 120,000 yuan as the expense for wasteland surveys in Jiangsu Province. More than 40 people from relevant units such as the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Provincial Water Conservancy Department, the Provincial Huai River Harnessing Headquarters, and the Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau have formed a comprehensive survey team, divided into four professional groups for soil, agriculture, water conservancy, and mass mobilization. They began field surveys at the end of February, and by the end of March, they had completed the survey of 610,000 mu of coastal wasteland in Dongtai and Dafeng counties.
    In addition to completing the wasteland survey and reconnaissance work as planned this year, they will also survey and map a topographic map of approximately 400,000 mu of wasteland and conduct detailed soil surveys of the 350,000 mu of land planned for reclamation and cultivation, in order to systematically understand the basic conditions of these lands, such as soil, water conservancy, and plant growth.

    江苏省开始大规模勘察荒地
    江苏省今年计划勘察荒地一百六十三万七千亩，为今后几年内大规模开垦荒地、有计划地发展国营农场作准备。这些荒地大部分分布在江苏省北部沿海大平原上，面积集中，适宜于机械耕作。在东台、大丰两县的沿海地区，约有六十一万亩的大块荒地，一般的荒地面积都在五万亩左右，最少的也在万亩以上。
    江苏省农林厅已成立了专门勘察机构，配备了农业、土壤、水利、测量等技术人员。农业部还拨出专款十二万元作为江苏省勘察荒地的经费。省农林厅、水利厅、省治淮指挥部、省盐务管理局等有关单位共派出四十余人，组成一支综合勘察队，分为土壤、农业、水利、民运等四个专业小组，在二月底开始进行野外勘察，到三月下旬已完成了东台、大丰两县沿海六十一万亩荒地的勘察工作。
    今年除将按计划完成荒地的调查、勘察工作外，还要测绘一张约四十万亩荒地的地形图，并对计划开垦种植的三十五万亩土地进行土壤详测，以便对这些土地的土壤、水利、植物生长等基本情况作系统的了解。
