Who is Endangering Peace in Korea

Cui Qi

Six divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteers are withdrawing from Korea to return to their homeland, and the vanguard has already crossed the Yalu River. This is another large-scale withdrawal of forces from Korea by the Chinese People's Volunteers, following the withdrawal of seven divisions last year. The Chinese people are taking this action out of their consistent position of striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and to ease the tense situation in the Far East. Therefore, this action is beneficial to peace in the Far East and Asia.

The Chinese people have always advocated the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, so that the Korean people can solve the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea in accordance with the principle of handling their own affairs themselves. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea recently proposed to limit the military forces of North and South Korea to an equal level of ten divisions, in order to stabilize the armistice and promote a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. However, these proposals from the Chinese and Korean sides have consistently been opposed by the United States and the Syngman Rhee group.

Contrary to the efforts of China and North Korea to ease the situation, the United States has been constantly taking large-scale reinforcement measures in South Korea and has expressed its intention to tear up the armistice agreement. In September 1954, the United States announced that it would allocate 700 million US dollars to help the Syngman Rhee group equip ten reserve divisions. Recently, Syngman Rhee also revealed that the United States has agreed to double this plan. In this way, in addition to stationing American troops in South Korea and maintaining twenty South Korean divisions with a force of 750,000 men, the US command is also stepping up the establishment of another twenty reserve divisions. It is in order to be able to transport large quantities of weapons and military materials into South Korea without restriction to implement these military plans that the United States is increasingly attacking the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and even openly expressing its intention to abolish the commission. Under the direction of the United States, the Syngman Rhee group's congress passed a resolution on March 31, demanding that the sixteen countries that invaded Korea "declare the armistice agreement null and void." At the same time, the Syngman Rhee group's "northward advance" rhetoric is rampant again.

The only excuse put forward by the United States when carrying out activities to undermine the armistice agreement and endanger peace in Korea is that China and North Korea "violated" the armistice agreement and "increased military strength" in North Korea. British diplomatic circles also came out to support the United States, saying that the US actions were "reasonable." But is there anything more black and white than this? It is impossible for any honest person in the world to call the withdrawal of thirteen divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea an "increase in military strength" in Korea, or to call the proposal of the Chinese and North Korean sides to limit the military strength of North and South Korea "violation" of the armistice. Similarly, it is impossible for any honest person in the world to regard the large-scale arming of the Syngman Rhee army by the United States in South Korea as not violating the armistice agreement, or to regard the calls and activities of the United States and the Syngman Rhee group to tear up the armistice agreement as not a serious damage to peace in Korea. Therefore, the United States' attempt to cover up its war conspiracy in Korea with this carelessly fabricated lie is obviously in vain.

People must also see that the war conspiracy being carried out by the United States in South Korea is coordinated with the war deployments it is actively carrying out in other parts of Asia. The news that the United States is trying to form a so-called "Northeast Asia Alliance" with Japan, the Syngman Rhee group, and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group in Taiwan has been around for a long time. Recently, US Secretary of the Army Stevens' activities in South Korea are said to be related to this US plan. International News Service said that Stevens' trip was to find ways to make the Syngman Rhee group's army "adapt" to the entire US war plan in the Far East, so that it would "coordinate actions" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group's army, in order to open up a so-called "second battlefield" for attacking the Chinese people in Korea.

Moreover, just after Stevens left Seoul, Syngman Rhee's "Minister of National Defense" Son Won-il claimed that Stevens had "promised him that he would do everything possible" to enable the Syngman Rhee puppet army to obtain atomic weapons. According to a Tokyo report from International News Service, when reporters asked Stevens to comment on Son Won-il's remarks, he did not deny them.

From this, it can be seen that the activities of the United States in South Korea not only seriously violate the armistice agreement and endanger peace in Korea, but are also part of its plan to launch an atomic war in Asia.

These activities of the United States in South Korea are making the situation in Korea and Asia increasingly worse. All honest people will admit that for the sake of peace in Korea and the Far East, the Korean armistice agreement must be maintained, not destroyed; the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission must be guaranteed, not abolished; the military strength of North and South Korea must be limited to a certain equal level in accordance with the proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, instead of wantonly increasing military strength in South Korea as the United States does.

The Chinese People's Volunteers have withdrawn thirteen divisions from Korea one after another, which is a major effort made for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. However, if the enemies of peace think that this is a loophole for them to exploit and attempt to take risks, then they will suffer greatly for their risky actions.

    是谁在危害朝鲜和平
    崔奇
    中国人民志愿军六个师正在从朝鲜撤返祖国，先头部队已经过了鸭绿江。这是中国人民志愿军继去年撤出七个师之后，又一次从朝鲜大规模撤出兵力。中国人民采取这个行动，是出于争取和平解决朝鲜问题的一贯立场，是为了缓和远东的紧张局势。因此，这个行动有利于远东和亚洲的和平。
    中国人民历来主张从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队，以便让朝鲜人民按照自己处理自己问题的原则来解决朝鲜的和平统一问题。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国不久前并建议把南北朝鲜的军事力量限制在十个师的同等水平，以稳定停战，促进朝鲜问题的和平解决。但是，中朝方面的这些建议一直遭到美国和李承晚集团的反对。
    同中朝方面的缓和局势的努力相反，美国在南朝鲜则不断地采取大规模增援性措施，并表示要撕毁停战协定。一九五四年九月，美国曾宣布，它要拨出七亿美元来帮助李承晚集团装备十个师的后备部队。最近李承晚又透露，美国已答应把这个计划扩大一倍。这样，美国司令部除了在南朝鲜留驻美国军队和维持着人数达七十五万人的南朝鲜军二十个师以外，还正在加紧建立另外的二十个后备师。美国就是为了能够毫不受限制地向南朝鲜运入大批武器和军用物资，以实现这些军事计划，所以日甚一日地向中立国监察委员会进攻，甚至公然表示要取消这个委员会。在美国的指使下，李承晚集团的国会于三月三十一日通过决议，竟要求侵略朝鲜的十六个国家“宣布停战协定作废”。同时，李承晚集团的“北进”论调又甚嚣尘上了。
    美国在进行破坏停战协定、危害朝鲜和平的活动时，提出来的唯一借口就是：中朝方面“破坏”停战协定，在北朝鲜“增加军力”。英国外交界人士也出来替美国帮腔，说美国的行动是“合乎情理的”。但是，还有什么比这更颠倒黑白的么？世界上不可能有任何一个正直的人，会把中国人民志愿军从朝鲜撤出十三个师兵力的行动叫做在朝鲜“增加军力”，会把朝中方面关于限制南北朝鲜兵力的建议叫做“破坏”停战。同样的，世界上也不可能有任何一个正直的人，会把美国在南朝鲜大规模武装李承晚军队，看作不是破坏停战协定，会把美国和李承晚集团想要撕毁停战协定的叫喊和活动，看作不是对朝鲜和平的严重损害。因此，美国想用这种粗心制造的谎言来掩盖它在朝鲜进行的战争阴谋，显然是白费的。
    人们还必须看到，美国在南朝鲜所进行的战争阴谋是和它在亚洲其他地区积极进行中的战争部署互相配合的。关于美国力图把日本、李承晚集团和台湾的蒋介石卖国集团组成一个所谓“东北亚联盟”的消息，由来已久。最近，美国陆军部长斯蒂文斯到南朝鲜活动，据透露就和美国的这种策划有关。国际新闻社说，斯蒂文斯此行是为了设法使李承晚集团的军队“适应”美国在远东的整个战争计划，使它和蒋介石卖国集团的军队“配合行动”，以便在朝鲜开辟进攻中国人民的所谓“第二战场”。
    而且，在斯蒂文斯刚刚离开汉城以后，李承晚集团“国防部长官”孙元一便声称，斯蒂文斯曾“答应他将尽他的一切可能”使李承晚伪军获得原子武器。据国际新闻社东京消息说，当记者们要求斯蒂文斯对孙元一的谈话表示意见时，他并未加以否认。
    由此可见，美国在南朝鲜的活动，不仅严重违反停战协定，危害朝鲜和平，而且是它准备在亚洲发动原子战争计划的一部分。
    美国在南朝鲜的这些活动，正在使朝鲜和亚洲局势日益恶化。一切正直的人们都会承认，为了朝鲜和远东和平的利益，必须维护朝鲜停战协定，而不是破坏它；必须保障中立国监察委员会的工作，而不是取消它；必须按照朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的建议来限制南北朝鲜的兵力到一定的同等水平，而不是像美国所做的那样，在南朝鲜肆意增加军力。
    中国人民志愿军先后从朝鲜撤回十三个师，是为了和平解决朝鲜问题而作的重大努力。但是，如果和平的敌人认为这是给他们的可乘之隙，而企图进行冒险，那末，他们就要因为他们的冒险行动而大吃苦头。
