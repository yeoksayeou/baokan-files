Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 9th. The heroic tank units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which have repeatedly performed outstanding feats on the Korean battlefield, began withdrawing from the Korean border on April 9th.

Before their departure, a Korean delegation headed by Kim Ung-ki, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, along with a cultural troupe of more than 60 people, warmly welcomed and comforted a certain unit of the returning tank forces. On the day before boarding, the mighty tank columns proceeded from their station to the railway station along several broad roads. The tank crews had planted the red flags they had won in the war on their tanks. Every soldier had changed into a brand-new single military uniform, with medals, awards, and commemorative badges hanging on their chests. The Korean people from many villages, large and small, gathered on the roads to see them off, and many children excitedly climbed the trees beside the roads, waving to the tank crews.

When the tank units boarded the train at a certain station, thousands of Korean people held a grand farewell ceremony. Many young women climbed onto the tanks to present flowers to the tank crews. Workers and students vied to carry the tank crews on their shoulders. The tanks were covered with farewell messages written by the Korean people. Many old men presented the soldiers with the most precious gift in Korea, the *kat*, and Korean Young Pioneers presented the tank crews with tank models they had made.

At 3:10 PM (Korean time) on the 9th, the first train carrying magnificent tanks left Sinuiju, the last city on the Korean border, amidst the cheers of the Korean people, and entered Andong in the motherland.

    志愿军返国的坦克部队开始撤离朝鲜国境
    新华社平壤九日电　在朝鲜战场屡建奇功的英雄的志愿军返国部队的坦克部队，从四月九日起开始撤离朝鲜国境。
    部队在出发前，以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会副委员长金应基为首的朝鲜代表团和文工团等一行六十多人，到归国的坦克部队某部进行了热烈的欢送和慰问。在登车的前一日，浩浩荡荡的坦克行列沿着几条宽阔的公路从驻地向车站进发。坦克手们把在战争中获得的红旗插在坦克上。每个战士都换上了崭新的单军服，胸前挂着勋章、奖章和纪念章。沿途许多大小村庄的朝鲜人民都聚集到公路上欢送，许多儿童兴奋地爬在公路旁边的树上，向坦克手们招手。
    当坦克部队在某车站上登车时，数以千计的朝鲜人民举行了盛大的欢送会。许多青年妇女登上坦克向坦克手们献花。工人和学生们争着把坦克手们抬在肩上。坦克上被欢送的朝鲜人民写满了字。许多老大爷把朝鲜最高贵的礼物——珂帽赠给战士们，朝鲜少年团员们把自己制造的坦克模型献给坦克手。
    九日下午三点十分（朝鲜时间），第一列载着雄伟庞大的坦克的列车，在朝鲜人民的欢送声中，离开朝鲜国境上的最后一个城市新义州，进入祖国的安东。
