    Marching Towards the Avenue of Peace
    An Interview with Zheng Zhenduo, Head of the Chinese Cultural Delegation to India and Burma
    I, along with the Chinese Cultural Delegation, traveled to many places in India and Burma. We spent more than forty days in India and thirty days in Burma. During these seventy-plus days, we were constantly greeted with excitement, enthusiastic welcomes, and meticulous care and hospitality. We often had tears of excitement in our eyes as we received garland after garland, placed around our necks by welcoming government representatives and representatives of the masses, and bouquet after bouquet, handed to us. The fragrant aroma of the flowers symbolized the benevolent and friendly atmosphere between the peoples of the two countries. We were surrounded by flowers, immersed in an atmosphere of kindness and friendship, receiving excited and enthusiastic welcomes.
    The hospitality and care shown to us by responsible government officials of India and Burma are unforgettable. The President of India, Dr. Prasad, and the President of Burma, Dr. Ba U, both warmly received us and personally attended our delegation's performances, sending us flower baskets and bouquets. Indian Prime Minister Nehru led us on tours of the gardens, took us to see the pair of pandas he was raising, watched our performances more than once, and personally presented garlands to the performers. Burmese Prime Minister U Nu went backstage to see the performers in their makeup, extending cordial greetings. He sent them flowers and also presented silver shields and gold medals. The warm and friendly hospitality of political figures in various regions is also something to be remembered for a long time.
    Many friends in cultural and artistic circles did not just casually watch our performances. They had praise and also criticism. They frankly expressed what they wanted to say. This was not just a nodding acquaintance. We did have debates. But the artistic policy of our New China, "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," ultimately left them with a very deep impression. Indian novelist Anand, great dancer Uday Shankar, Burmese musician U Ba Than, and many other friends in the literary and artistic circles were so caring and attentive to us. Some Indian and Burmese artists particularly fulfilled their responsibility as "good teachers and helpful friends" for some of our delegates learning Indian and Burmese music and dance programs.
    Furthermore, the friendly attitude of the people of India and Burma towards us is also unforgettable. Wherever we went, there was excited and enthusiastic welcome and cordial and sincere hospitality. Let me give a few examples. In big cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Madras, Calcutta, Yangon, and Mandalay, the welcome was undoubtedly rich and diverse, and the hospitality was very well-arranged; but in relatively remote cities and small towns, especially in cities and small towns where there was no prior preparation and where we would not be staying but only passing through, we also received unexpected and warm welcomes, and their sincere welcome, as if they wanted to pour out all the emotions stored in their hearts, was even more unforgettable.
    The mass welcome rally temporarily organized in Agra was colorful and lively. The host of the welcome rally was an old woman with white hair, who, in a trembling voice, spoke of the historical friendship between the Indian and Chinese peoples; in a trembling voice, she shouted "Long live Sino-Indian friendship!" and "Long live world and Asian peace!"; with trembling, withered hands, she presented me with a white marble model of the Taj Mahal. As I received this weighty gift, tears welled up in my eyes, blurring my vision a little.
    Our train passed through Gulbarga station. Crowds of people gathered on the platform, shouting the slogan "The Indian and Chinese people are brothers." They asked the train to stop for an extra ten minutes, or at least five minutes, to listen to speeches and songs from the brothers and sisters from China. The eyes of those dense crowds of Indian brothers and sisters were so big, so bright, and so intently focused on our carriages, on each and every one of us, on our faces and eyes. Those earnest and passionate gazes seemed to adorn our hearts with immortal garlands of the heart. We could not help but get off the train and mingle with them, eagerly shaking hands, saying things we didn't understand, pushing and shoving, and unknowingly straying far from our own carriages. The whistle for departure blew, and we had to board another carriage; at this time, it was impossible to squeeze back into the original carriage.
    On the evening of the second day, there was a mass rally on the beach in Madras. This rally was convened by the All-India Congress. During the day, more than 20,000 people paraded through the streets in bullock carts. By nightfall, the beach was densely packed with countless people, some bringing their entire families, men, women, and children. It is said that estimates put the number at over 50,000, but in reality, it probably far exceeded this estimate. These millions of people surrounded the podium and sat on the semi-wet sand. Millions of large eyes were intently and passionately focused on the brightly lit podium. The speech by the chairman of the congress, Dr. Kitchlew, particularly emphasized welcoming the cultural delegation from China and stressed that to safeguard world peace, it was necessary to oppose and stop American imperialism's occupation of Taiwan. At that time, the cries of "Oppose American Imperialism's Occupation of Taiwan" and "Defend World and Asian Peace" roared up, shouted in unison by millions of people, echoing in every corner of the beach, and echoing throughout Asia, every corner of the world. When I finished speaking and Dr. Kitchlew, on behalf of the congress, presented flowers to the people attending, the crowd below erupted in enthusiastic and unusually excited applause. Again, millions of people shouted in unison: "The Indian and Chinese people are brothers!" In India, as in China, millions of people realize that the friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples symbolizes a tremendous force for safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. And we, the people of China and India, with a combined population of nearly one billion, deeply understand that once that benevolent heart of opposing aggression and seeking peace is transformed into strength, that strength will be so strong!
    When we went to visit the Seven Pagodas near Mumbai, we passed through several small villages, where crowds gathered to welcome us. School children shouted the slogans "The Indian and Chinese people are brothers" and "Long live the People's Republic of China," waving small flags, and lined up along the road to welcome us. As soon as the car stopped, they swarmed forward to present garlands. Even upon arriving at the remote seaside scenic spot of the Seven Pagodas, the villagers spontaneously flocked to welcome us. In countless bright, large eyes, we saw the passionate enthusiasm of an excited and sincere welcome. Most touching was that, even late at night, at every station our train passed through, there were crowds cheering, knocking on the doors and windows of the carriages, asking to meet the delegates. They offered us garlands they had picked and woven themselves, they gave us what they considered to be their most precious agricultural products, handicrafts, and even poems and drawings they had created themselves. All of this, contained within the garlands and gifts, was a united, benevolent, and friendly heart and boundless enthusiasm. Once, a mother, wearing a very ordinary "sari," holding a boy of less than two years old in one arm, raised a flag embroidered with a white dove of peace on a blue cloth in the other hand and said to me: "I made this myself, especially to present to you." The child's large, bright eyes were also looking at me. I took the flag of peace, held the child's hand, and was so moved that I could not say a word. There were many such scenes, and recalling them always stirs emotions.
    When we arrived in Mandalay, Burma, as soon as we got off the plane, we saw many government representatives and representatives of people's organizations lined up in the scorching sun to welcome us. We felt a wave of heat rushing towards us. They had waited at the airport for two or three hours in the heat. After presenting bouquet after bouquet of flowers, they led us to a welcoming marquee to rest. The construction of that marquee was meticulously designed, clearly a grand and splendid tent. The welcome speech by the government representative of the Mandalay region was enthusiastic and recounted the historical friendship between China and Burma. The original manuscript of the welcome speech was written on silk and contained in a carved silver tube. After the speech, the silver tube was presented to us. In India, we also received such silver tubes containing speeches more than once.
    We passed through Sagaing, which is not a big city, nor was it a place we were scheduled to stop. However, the local people had built a shed by the roadside and prepared food and drinks to wait for us to entertain us. The crowds thronged in front of the shed, looking at us with such kindness and friendliness. Those responsible for the hospitality were several women and several local overseas Chinese. One of the hosts said: "We really wanted to have the opportunity to see your performance, but it's not easy to go to Mandalay. I didn't expect to be able to welcome you here!" Several others said: "Could you sing a few songs for us?" Our choir sang the "Sino-Burmese Friendship Song" in Burmese. Enthusiasm was exchanged. The crowd showed extreme excitement and welcome. When we left, we were reluctant to part.
    All of this shows that, in our personally experienced seventy-plus days of travel, performances, lectures, and talks, officials and people from all walks of life in India and Burma treated our delegation with such warm hospitality and welcome. That is to say, they welcomed the cultural delegation from China, representing the Chinese people, with such enthusiasm and excitement, they watched our performances with such sympathy and joy, and they were so united in defending peace and resisting aggression. This is not accidental. This fully illustrates that the friendship between the Chinese government and people and the governments and peoples of India and Burma is growing day by day. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have enabled our country and India, Burma, and many other countries in Southeast Asia and other regions to better understand each other, respect each other, and further consolidate and develop friendly relations with each other. This also proves that the cause of safeguarding peace in this region is being increasingly consolidated and developed. The recent Asian Countries Conference held in New Delhi showed how powerfully the people of Asian countries are shouting out the call to defend peace and oppose the use of atomic weapons. From what we have experienced, even if the governments of a few countries in the world do not want peace, the people of the whole world, the people of Asia and Africa, will have sufficient and tremendous power to lead the world onto the avenue of peace.

    走向和平大道
    访印度、缅甸中国文化代表团团长　郑振铎
    我和中国文化代表团一起，游历了印度和缅甸两国的很多地方。我们在印度四十多天，在缅甸三十天。在这七十多天里，我们天天是在兴奋、热烈的欢迎和无微不至的关怀和招待之中度过的。我们常常双眼含着激动的泪花，去迎接着一副又一副的从欢迎的政府代表和群众代表手里套在我们脖子上的花环，以及一束又一束的递在我们手上的花朵。花的芬芳的气味，象征着两国人民之间的良善的友好的气氛。我们是在鲜花的堆子里，良善的友谊的气氛里，受着兴奋的热烈的欢迎的。
    印、缅两国的政府负责人士对于我们的招待和关怀，是不能使我们忘记的。印度总统普拉沙德博士和缅甸总统巴宇博士都亲切的接见我们，并在我们代表团演出的时候，亲来参加，还向我们致送花篮和花束。印度尼赫鲁总理领着我们游园，和我们去看他喂养的一对熊猫，不止一次的观看我们的演出，亲自向演员们送花环。缅甸吴努总理，曾到后台去看演员们化装殷勤的接待他们。向他们送花，还赠送银盾及金质奖章。各地方的政界人士的那份热情而亲切的招待，也是令人长远记住的。
    许多文化艺术界的朋友们，对于我们的演出，不是泛泛的看过就算数。他们有赞赏，也有批评。他们坦率的说出他们自己要说的话。这不是平常的点头之交。我们不是没有辩论的。但我们新中国的艺术的方针：“百花齐放，推陈出新”，终于给他们以极深刻的印象。印度的小说家阿南达，大舞蹈家武特桑喀，缅甸的音乐家吴巴单，还有许许多多的文艺界的朋友们，对于我们是那末的关怀备至。有些印度和缅甸的艺术家特别对于我们部分代表们学习印度、缅甸的音乐、舞蹈节目尽了“良师益友”的责任。
    再说印、缅人民群众对我们的友好态度，也使我们难以忘却。无论我们走到那里，那里就有着兴奋的热烈的欢迎和殷勤恳切的招待。举几个例子来说吧。在大城市像德里、孟买、马德拉斯、加尔各答、仰光和瓦城，那欢迎的色彩是会浓厚的，多样的，那招待是会有条件很周到的；但在比较偏僻的城市和小村镇，特别是没有事前准备，而且不会在那里住下来而只是经过一下的城市和小村镇，也受到不期而遇的热烈欢迎，而且他们是那末真诚的像要把心里所蕴藏的感情全都倾泄了出来的欢迎，那更是使人不容易忘却的了。
    在亚格拉临时布置起来的群众欢迎大会，是有声有色的。欢迎大会的主持者是一位白发苍苍的老妇，她以巅巍巍的声音，说着印度人民和中国人民的历史上的友好的经过；她以巅巍巍的声音，高喊着印中友好万岁，高喊着世界和亚洲和平万岁；她以颤抖着的枯瘦的双手，捧了一具白大理石制的泰姬陵的模型递到我的手上，我在接过这个有分量的礼物的时候，我的眼上闪着泪影而有点模糊了。
    我们的火车经过古尔巴格站。站台上聚集了层层密密的群众，在高喊着“印、中人民是兄弟”的口号。他们要求火车多停十分钟，至少是五分钟，要听听来自中国的兄弟姊妹们的讲话和歌声。那层层密密的印度的兄弟姊妹们的眼睛是那末大，那末光亮，那末专心一意的注视着我们的车厢，注视着我们的每一个人的身上，脸上、眼上，那样恳切的热情的眼光是把心的不朽的花环佩戴在我们的心上了。我们不能不下车来，和他们挤在一块，热烘烘的争着拉手，彼此说着不懂的话，挤来挤去的，不知不觉的离开自己的车厢已经很远了。开车的叫笛声响了，只好上了另一节车厢；在这时候是没法子再挤回原来的车厢了。
    在二日的晚上，马德拉斯的海滩上有一个群众大会。这个大会是由全印和大召开的。白天里，坐牛车在街上游行的就有两万多人。一到晚上，海滩上就黑压压的拥挤着数不清的人，有的携男带女的全家都来了。据说估计有五万人以上，但在实际上恐要远远的超过这个估计的数字。这千千万万的人，拥围着主席台而坐在半湿的沙地上。千千万万只大眼睛就专心一致的热情的注视在灯光特别明亮的主席台上。大会主席克其鲁博士的讲话，特别着重在欢迎来自中国的文化代表团，并强调的说，要保卫世界和平，就要反对并制止美国帝国主义侵占台湾。当时“反对美帝国主义侵占台湾”和“保卫世界和亚洲和平”的呼声，随着怒吼了起来，千万人异口同声的吼叫着，响遍了海滩上的每一角隅，也响遍了整个亚洲，整个世界的每一角隅。当我讲完了话，克其鲁代表大会向我们到会的人献花时，台下的群众是那样的响起了热烈的兴奋异常的掌声。又是千万人异口同声的喊叫：“印、中人民是兄弟！”在印度，也像在中国，千千万万的人都认识到：中、印两国人民之间的友好，就象征着保卫亚洲和世界和平的巨大力量。而我们中印两国将近十亿人口的人民，我们自己深深明白，那反对侵略、要求和平的良善的心，一旦化成了力量时，那力量是多末坚强啊！
    我们到孟买附近的七星塔去参观时，路过好几个小村镇，都有群众聚集着欢迎。学校的儿童们喊着“印中人民是兄弟”和“中华人民共和国万岁”的口号，手摇着小旗子，列队在大路旁欢迎我们。车子一停，就纷纷拥上来献花环。就在到达那寂寞的海滨名胜七星塔时，村中的群众也不期而会的蜂拥而来欢迎。在无数的光亮的大眼睛里，我们看到了激动而真心的欢迎的热情。最可感动的是，就在深夜里，凡是我们火车经过的站，就有群众在欢呼，在扣打着车厢的门和窗，要求和代表们见面。他们向我们献出他们自己采撷自己编结的花环，他们向我们致送他们自己认为最珍贵的农产品、手工业制造品，甚至他们自己创作的诗歌和图画。所有这一切，蕴蓄在花环和礼物之中的，是一致的良善的友好的心与无限的热情。有一次，一个母亲，披着一件极普通的“纱丽”，一只手臂抱着一个两岁不到的男孩子，一只手却举着一幅蓝布上用白线绣着的一只和平鸽子的旗，向我说道：“这是我自己的手做的，特地做来献给你们的。”那个孩子光溜溜的大眼睛也在向我望着。我接过那面和平的旗子，拉着孩子的手，感动得说不出一句话来。这样的场面是很多的，回忆起来，总是使人感情激动。
    我们到了缅甸的曼德勒城，一下飞机，就看到许多政府代表和人民团体代表在烈日之下列队欢迎。我们感到一阵热气冲来。他们冒着炎热在机场上等待了两三个钟头。他们致送了一束一束的花朵之后，又引我们到一个欢迎彩棚里休息。那个彩棚的搭盖，是经过精心设计的，显然是隆重而辉煌的棚幕。曼德勒区的政府代表的欢迎辞是热烈的，而且叙述了中、缅两国历史上的交谊。欢迎辞的原稿是写在绢上，用雕花的银筒子装盛着的。讲完了话，就把这银筒子送给了我们。——在印度，我们也不止一次的接受了这样的盛着讲辞的银筒子。
    我们经过实阶，那个地方不是一个大城，而且也不是我们预定停留的地方，但当地的人民在道旁搭盖了一所棚子，准备了饮食在等候招待我们。群众拥挤在棚前，那样的亲切而友善的望着我们。负责招待的是几位妇女和当地的几个华侨。一位招待的人说道：“我们很想有机会看到你们的演出，可是不容易到曼德勒去。想不到能在这里欢迎你们！”还有几位就说：“能不能为我们唱几个歌呢？”我们的合唱队以缅语歌唱了“缅中友好歌”。热情在交流。群众显出了极高的兴奋和欢迎。离开的时候，彼此是依依不舍。
    所有这一切，都表明：在我们亲身体验的七十多天的游历、演出、讲演和谈话里，印度、缅甸两国的朝野人士，对于我们代表团是多末热情的招待和欢迎。也就是说，对于来自中国、代表中国人民的文化代表团是多末热情和兴奋的欢迎着，对于我们的演出节目是多末同情而欢欣的观看着，对于保卫和平和反抗侵略是多末同心同德。这不是偶然的。这充分的说明了中国政府和人民，与印度、缅甸政府和人民之间的友好是在日益增长着。和平共处的五项原则，使我国和印、缅两国，乃至许多东南亚和别的地区的国家，更加彼此了解、彼此尊重、彼此之间的友好关系也更加巩固发展了。这也就证明在这个地区的保卫和平事业，是正在日益巩固和发展。最近在新德里召开的亚洲国家会议，表现了亚洲国家的人民是多末有力地喊出保卫和平、反对使用原子武器的呼声。从我们所体验到的，世界上即使有少数国家的政府不要和平，但全世界的人民，亚非二洲的人民是会有足够的巨大力量，使世界走上和平大道的。
