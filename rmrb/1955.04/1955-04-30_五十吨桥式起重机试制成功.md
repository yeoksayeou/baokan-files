The fifty-ton bridge crane has been successfully trial-produced at the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant. The engineers, technicians, and workers who personally designed and manufactured this steel giant recently observed its trial operation. It lightly lifted a workpiece weighing over sixty tons with its main hook, running on steel beams in the metalworking shop at a speed of 105 meters per minute longitudinally and 43.3 meters per minute transversely.

The fifty-ton bridge crane is a very important type of handling machinery in metallurgical and machinery factories, and the domestic demand is very high. Currently, eight major factories, including Anshan, are signing contracts with the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant to manufacture fifty-ton bridge cranes, and some contracts have already been signed.

    五十吨桥式起重机试制成功
    五十吨桥式起重机在太原重型机器厂试制成功了。亲手设计和制造这个钢铁巨人的工程技术人员和工人们最近参观了它的试运转的情形。它用它的主钩轻轻提起了六十多吨重的工作物，用每分钟纵行一百零五公尺、横行四十三点三公尺的速度在金工车间钢梁上跑动着。
    五十吨桥式起重机是冶金和机械工厂中很重要的一种搬运机械，国内需要量很大。现在，已有鞍山等八个大工厂正在和太原重型机器厂签订制造五十吨桥式起重机的合同，有的合同已经签订。
