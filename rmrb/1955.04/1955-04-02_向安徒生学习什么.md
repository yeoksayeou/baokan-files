What to Learn from Andersen
Chen Bochui

Today (April 2nd) is the 150th anniversary of the birth of the great Danish fairy tale writer Hans Christian Andersen.

Andersen was an enthusiastic singer of peace, using simple and concise poetic verses to praise peace. In his beautiful fantasies, he was full of hope, pursuing a better life of freedom and ideals, and looking forward to that bright, happy, and blissful world.

He was an idealist with a strong sense of optimism, and also a humanist writer.

In Andersen's immortal works, we can feel that he stood with the working people, loved all good people, sympathized with and pitied the oppressed little people in class society. He had a strong sense of justice and a clear distinction between love and hate. He hated the enemies of the people, the rulers, and their henchmen, ruthlessly exposing their sinful acts: the emperor's hypocrisy, the prince's brutality, the bishop's cunning, the ministers' and officials' stupidity, etc. (see "The Emperor's New Clothes," "The Wicked Prince," "The Wild Swans," "The Nightingale," "The Galoshes of Fortune," etc.). He satirized and ridiculed them with indignation and bitterness, stripping them of their outer garments and making them look utterly ugly in front of the people.

He was also a patriotic writer, painting the beautiful scenery of the motherland's fields with lyrical and colorful strokes, as if creating an oil painting. Because of his love for his country, he cherished the new generation who inherited the cause of the motherland, just like protecting tender seedlings, lamenting their tragic lives and protesting their suffering. He was the children's most enthusiastic, kind, and faithful "nanny" and friend (see "Holger Danske," "Children's Chatter," "The Little Match Girl," "The Bronze Boar," etc.).

His life's artistic practice was to serve the next generation wholeheartedly.

As an outstanding fairy tale writer, Andersen's brilliant achievements in his literary career were by no means accidental. If he had not valued the nation's literary heritage and seriously learned from folk literature, he could not have stepped into this magnificent area of the literary garden – the realm of fairy tales – and become a brilliant figure in the "fairy tale kingdom."

Andersen took several turns in his creative practice and found a correct path. He was inspired by folk literature and drew creative power from the essence of folk literature. He critically absorbed the excellent traditions of folk literature, and through his creative artistic labor, processed and recreated them into new and delightful works of art, thus writing the first collection of fairy tales containing four pieces, including "The Tinderbox," "Little Claus and Big Claus," "The Princess and the Pea," and "Little Ida's Flowers." According to the writer's own records, only the last of these four pieces was original. Later, his "The Wild Swans" was based on Danish folk tales, while "Paradise," "The Traveling Companion," "The Flying Trunk," "The Storks," "The Swineherd," "The Buckwheat," and "The Elder-Tree Mother" were all adaptations of folk legends and folk tales he had heard. Even his famous work "The Emperor's New Clothes" was based on an old Spanish story; and "The Rose Elf" was inspired by an Italian folk song.

The oral creations of the people – folk literature – are like springs flowing from deep mountains, always alive, fresh, and inexhaustible. If writers can inherit and develop its advanced and excellent elements, they will inevitably be able to write works with a people's character that are loved and appreciated by the people. Andersen's fairy tales are a vivid example. He went to the people – the mother with endless creative power – and was "nursed" there, and thus grew up, became stronger, and gave birth to this beautiful daughter – the fairy tale.

Lenin once taught us that we must preserve those good things. "Take it as an example and hold on to it tightly. Why should we despise true beauty and abandon it forever, not taking it as a starting point for further development, just because it is 'old'?" (See Zetkin: "Reminiscences of Lenin," Sanlian Bookstore Edition, page 12).

This very accurately and truly explains the basis of Andersen's success.

Andersen's learning from the oral literature of the people was not simply imitating and copying like a gourd drawn according to a model, mechanically applying a set of rules, but selectively, developmentally, abandoning its dross, inheriting its essence, and developing and improving on this basis. Therefore, most of Andersen's later works are literary fairy tales created through independent thinking. However, they still retain the warm tone and earthy atmosphere of the folk, and are always admired by readers.

Since leaving home at the age of fourteen, Andersen traveled around, for work, for study, and for life. Although he lived a wandering and difficult life, he gained a lot of life experience. From the age of twenty-six, he consciously began to travel, to experience life. In his own words, "Traveling is also life." He traveled all over the country, and then went abroad. First he went to Germany, and after returning, he wrote "In the Hartz Mountains," which showed the legendary color of fairy tales. A year later, he went to Germany again, then to France, and later to Italy, Sweden, Greece, Turkey, Hungary, the Netherlands, England, and almost all over Europe. Until the age of sixty-three, he often traveled back and forth between home and abroad. He was not just sightseeing, but mainly to broaden his horizons, increase his knowledge, and draw inspiration from life.

In his works, Andersen often naturally and skillfully used the living language and oral language of the people, which he gained from experiencing life. In his article "The Source and System of Fairy Tales," he mentioned that the first three fairy tales he wrote were based on interviews with mechanics and hemp gatherers. Even his creation "Little Ida's Flowers" was due to him hearing a poet telling his daughter about various flowers in the botanical garden. When he was writing, he preserved and wrote down what the girl said. When he was spending the summer, the garden where he lived was full of burdock flowers, and those slowly crawling snails, so he wrote an interesting and meaningful "Happy Family."

He once said: "These stories are like seeds in my mind. As long as there is a little rain, a little sunshine, and a little wormwood wine, they will bloom." Andersen's creative practice shows that life has an important influence on creation; it also shows that the ideological consciousness of the works, even some fantasies in fairy tales, are reflections of everything that exists objectively.

Although Andersen's "traveling life" cannot be compared with our current "experiencing life," he after all swam from the big ocean of life, and not only gained inspiration and help in themes and topics, but also was tested and tempered ideologically, so that he could write fairy tales that are wholeheartedly loved by children all over the world, as well as adults who have not lost their childlike innocence, and that have a unique style.

Andersen immersed his whole body and mind in his creative career. He said: "A flower is also talking to me. When I am in a good mood, I can almost sit down and write a fairy tale." Listening to him say this, his creation of fairy tales seems to be a very easy and effortless job. No, on the contrary. It is precisely because of his dedication to his work and his unparalleled love for children's literature that he spoke such a humorous and interesting "fairy tale" kind of words.

After finding a topic and choosing a theme, he often told it to the children first, and then observed their reactions, recorded their opinions, and then started writing. The "The Leaping Match," which describes the jumping competition between fleas, grasshoppers, and frogs, was able to be written so vividly and interestingly because the children helped him. He treated his work seriously and solemnly. Whether he recalled something while walking, gained insight while reading, was inspired while talking with friends, felt something while watching a drama, or gained new knowledge while visiting cities and towns, ... all were closely linked to his creative work. He truly achieved that "life practice" and "creative practice" breathed together, were connected by flesh and blood, and were integrated into a whole.

His creative attitude was also very meticulous and responsible. This was most prominently demonstrated when writing the longest fairy tale "The Marsh King's Daughter." Like when writing other fairy tales, after determining the theme, he observed it like using a microscope, considering its structure, tailoring, and expression techniques. Then he told the entire plot of the fairy tale to his friends, and went back and wrote it out. Feeling dissatisfied, he rewrote it three times, but still could not be satisfied, thinking that there were still some places that were not written clearly, not explained clearly, and he believed that these places could and must be written clearly. So he temporarily put down his pen, carefully studied several local folk legends, and read several "African Travelogues" that were popular at the time, "gaining many tropical lush scenes and the concept of novel things in that place," and then read several books about "bird flight," so that he could express the characteristics of the birds' lives written in the fairy tale. After putting in such hard work, he started writing again. "Now the era should be brought forward a bit, and the beginning should be closer to the actual situation." Even so, he edited and revised as he wrote, changing the draft three times before feeling that it could not be changed, and made it the final draft.

He once said: "Every time a work is finished and sent out, I feel both happy and scared, intertwined with two complex emotions. God, I hope I never write a wrong word, and every word can be explained to you." Saying this so sincerely and earnestly, isn't this the tone of a writer with a high sense of responsibility?

Andersen's entire fairy tale works, 168 pieces, are all precious poems. He used his unique artistic touch to create these lovely works that are full of strange fantasies and also full of realistic significance, full of humor and also full of satire, all of which are the fruits of meticulous and hard work.

The World Peace Council called on peace-loving people all over the world to commemorate him as one of the world's cultural celebrities to be commemorated this year, because he was a great realist writer and at the same time a humanitarian peace fighter. And his serious study, serious life, and serious creation, for Chinese writers, especially children's literature workers, is even more a model in improving artistic accomplishment and strengthening artistic practice.

    向安徒生学习什么
    陈伯吹
    今天（四月二日）是伟大的丹麦童话作家安徒生诞生一百五十周年纪念日。
    安徒生是热情的和平歌手，他用朴素、简洁的诗句歌颂着和平。他在他的美丽的幻想里，满怀着希望，追求着美好的自由的理想生活，憧憬那个光明的快乐的幸福世界。
    他是一个富有乐观主义精神的理想主义者，同时也是一个人道主义的作家。
    在安徒生的不朽的作品里，我们可以感觉到：他是和劳动人民站在一起，爱一切善良的人，同情并且怜悯阶级社会中被压迫的小人物。他怀有强烈的正义感，爱憎分明。憎恨那些人民的敌人、统治者和他们所御用的帮凶者，无情地揭露他们的罪恶行为：皇帝的虚伪、王子的残暴、主教的阴险、大臣和官吏的愚蠢等等（见“皇帝的新衣”、“恶毒的王子”、“天鹅”、“夜莺”、“幸运的套鞋”等篇）。他愤慨又辛辣地讽刺嘲笑他们，剥光他们的外衣，使他们在人民面前赤裸裸地丑态百出。
    他又是一个爱国主义的作家，彷佛作油画一样，用了抒情的多采的笔，描绘着祖国原野的美丽风光。由于他热爱祖国，对于承继祖国事业的新生一代，像爱护柔嫩的苗芽一般地爱护他们，为他们的生活悲惨而控诉，也为他们的遭受摧残而抗议，他是孩子们最热心、最亲切、最忠实的“保姆”和朋友（见“丹麦人荷尔格”、“孩子们的闲谈”、
  “卖火柴的女儿”、“铜猪”等篇）。
    他一生的艺术实践，是忠心耿耿地为了下一代服务。
    作为杰出的童话作家安徒生，他在文学事业上灿烂的成就决不是偶然的。要不是他重视民族的文学遗产，和认真地向民间文学学习，他不可能踏入这块文学园林中的壮丽无比的区域——童话的境界中去，而成为“童话王国”里的光辉人物。
    安徒生在创作实践中转了几个弯，摸到了一条正确的道路。他被民间文学所鼓舞，并在民间文学的精华深处汲取了创作的力量。他批判地吸收了民间文学的优秀的传统，通过他创造性的艺术劳动，加工和再创造，成为新的可喜的艺术品，就这样写出了包含“打火匣”、“小克劳斯和大克劳斯”、
  “豌豆上的公主”、“小蔼达的花”等四篇的第一部童话集。而根据作家自己的记载，这四篇中只有最后一篇是创作。以后他写的“天鹅”是取材于丹麦的民间故事，而“乐园”、“旅伴”、“飞箱”、
  “鹳鸟”、“笨汉”、“荞麦”、“接骨木女神”等，都是他所听到的民间传说和民间故事的改写。就是他那篇著名的作品“皇帝的新衣”，也还是西班牙的老故事的底子；而“玫瑰花妖”，却是从意大利的民歌里得到了题材。
    人民的口头创作——民间文艺，像从深山里流出来的泉水，经常是活的、新鲜的、永不枯竭的。如果作家能够继承并且发扬它的先进和优秀的成分，必然可以写出具有人民性的而为人民所喜闻乐见的作品。安徒生的童话作品就是活生生的范例。他走向人民——具有无穷无尽的创造力的母亲，在人民那里得到了“哺乳”，于是成长了、壮大了，产下了这个美丽的女儿——童话。
    列宁曾经教导我们必须保存那些美好的东西。
  “拿它作为一个榜样，紧紧地把握住它。为什么只是因为它‘旧’，就要蔑视真正的美，永远抛弃它，不把它当作进一步发展的出发点呢？”（见蔡特金：“列宁印象记”，三联书店版，第十二页）
    这就非常精确而真切地说明了安徒生的成功的基础在哪里。
    安徒生学习人民的口头文学，也不是依样画葫芦般地模仿和抄袭，机械地硬搬一套，而是有选择地、发展地、扬弃它的糟粕，继承它的精华，并且在这样的基础上发展和提高。所以安徒生后期的作品，绝大部分是经过独立思考的创作的文学童话。但是仍然带有民间的温暖的情调和泥土的气息，永远为读者所赞赏。
    安徒生自从十四岁离开了家，到处奔波，为了工作，为了求学，也为了生活，虽然过的是流浪的苦难的生涯，却获得了不少的生活经验。从二十六岁起，他就有意识地开始旅行，去体验生活，用他自己的话来说，“旅行也是生活。”他在国内跑遍了，就到国外去。首先到德国，在回来后写了一篇
  “在哈茨山中”，就表现了童话的传奇的色彩。隔了一年又到德国，再到法国，以后又到意大利、瑞典、希腊、土耳其、匈牙利、荷兰、英国，几乎跑遍了整个欧洲，直到六十三岁的高龄，还常常来往于国内外。他不仅仅是在游山玩水，主要在于扩大眼界，增长见识，从生活中汲取题材。
    安徒生在作品里，常常很自然而又巧妙地运用了人民的活的语言、口头的语言，这些，都是从体验生活中得来。他在“童话的来源和系统”的文章中，提到那最早写的三篇童话，是从机械匠和采野麻的人口中采访来的。即使他的创作“小蔼达的花”，也是由于他听得一位诗人在植物园中给他的女儿讲述各种的花，当他写作时，把女孩子所说的话也保存下来写了进去。他在消夏的时候，住所的园子里，长满了牛蒡花，还有那些缓缓爬行的蜗牛，他就写了一篇有趣而意味深长的“幸福的家庭”。
    他曾经说：“这些故事，在我的脑子里就是像种子一般，只要下一点儿雨，晒一点儿阳光，再撒一点儿蔯蒿酒，就开出花来了。”安徒生的创作实践，说明了生活对于创作具有重要的影响；也说明了作品的思想意识，即使是在童话中的一些幻想，都是客观存在的一切事物的反映。
    虽然安徒生的“旅行生活”，不可能和我们现在的“体验生活”相提并论。然而他毕竟是从大的生活海洋中游泳过来，不仅在主题和题材上得到了启发和帮助，而且也在思想上受到了考验和锻炼，才能够写出为全世界孩子们、以及不失其赤子之心的成人们所衷心喜爱的、而又独具风格的童话。
    安徒生整个身心沉浸在他的创作事业里，他说过：“一朵花也在跟我说话。当我心境好的时候，几乎坐下来就可以写出童话的样子。”听他这么说，他创作童话彷佛是一件很轻松、而又毫不费力的工作。不，恰恰相反。正因为他对于工作的专心致志，对于儿童文学事业的无比热爱，才说出这样风趣的、有意思的“童话”式的话来。
    他在找到题材、选定主题以后，往往先讲一遍给孩子们听，随后观察他们的反应、记取他们的意见，再动手创作。那篇写跳蚤、蚱蜢、青蛙比赛跳高的“跳蛙”，所以能够写得这么生动有趣，就是孩子们帮助了他。他对待工作是认真、严肃的。不论当他在散步时有所回忆，在读书时有所心得，和朋友们谈天时有所启发，观赏戏剧时有所感悟，游览城乡时有所新知，……都和他的创作工作紧密地联结起来，真正做到了“生活实践”和“创作实践”呼吸相通，血肉相连，溶合成一个整体。
    他的创作态度又是很细致、很负责的，这在写作最长的那篇童话“沼泽王的女儿”时，表现得最为突出。和他写别篇童话一样，他在确定题材以后，就像用显微镜似地观察一番，考虑它的结构、剪裁、表现手法，随后把这个童话的全部情节向朋友讲述一遍，回去就写出来了。觉得不能满意，一直改写了三遍，仍旧不能满意，认为还有一些地方没有写得明显，没有交代得清楚，而他是相信这些地方是可以、而且必须写清楚的。于是他就暂时搁下了笔，仔细地研究了本地方的几个民间传说，又阅读了当时流行的几种“非洲游记”，“脑子里得到了许多热带茂盛的情景和那地方新奇事物的概念”，再读了几种关于讲述“鸟类飞行”的书，使自己对于童话里所写的那些鸟的生活，能够表现出它们的特性来。这样下了一番苦工之后，才重新又开始写作。“现在关于年代要提早一些，开端要离实际的情形更加接近一些。”虽然如此，他又边写边改，换稿三次，才觉得改无可改，作为定稿。
    他曾经说过：“每次作品写成送出去时，又喜欢、又害怕，交织着两种复杂的情绪。上帝啊，希望我永远不写错一个字，每一个字都可以向你交代。”说得这样真挚诚恳，难道这还不是具有高度责任感的作家的口吻吗？
    安徒生全部童话著作一六八篇，全部是珍贵的诗篇。他运用那独特的艺术的笔触，创作这些富有奇异幻想、也富有现实意义，富有幽默情趣、也富有讽刺意味的可爱的作品，都是一笔不苟的辛勤劳动的果实。
    世界和平理事会号召全世界爱好和平的人民，作为本年纪念的世界文化名人之一来纪念他，是因为他是一个现实主义的伟大作家，同时是一个人道主义的和平斗士。而他的认真学习、认真生活、认真创作，对于中国作家特别是儿童文学工作者来说，在提高艺术修养和加强艺术实践方面，更是一位典范。（附图片）
