Our Party, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, has thoroughly shattered the conspiracy of the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance. This is a major victory for our Party and the people of the whole country in the struggle for the cause of socialism; it is a victory of decisive significance in the entire development history of our Party.

As everyone knows, with the transition from the stage of the new democratic revolution to the stage of the socialist revolution, the class struggle will not only not ease up, but will only become more complex and more acute. As pointed out in the "Resolution of the National Conference of the Communist Party of China on the Anti-Party Alliance of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi": "On the one hand, the establishment and development of the People's Republic of China have aroused extreme hostility from imperialism, especially American imperialism; American imperialism is continuing to occupy our territory of Taiwan and is actively using Taiwan and other military bases to carry out subversive activities and prepare for wars of aggression against our country. On the other hand, the remaining counter-revolutionary elements and the reactionary elements among the bourgeoisie who resolutely oppose socialist transformation in our country are also stepping up their conspiracy of counter-revolutionary restoration with the progress of our socialist cause." Whether it is foreign imperialists or domestic counter-revolutionary elements, they all know that the most effective way to attack the Chinese people is to first attack the leadership of the Chinese people and the Chinese working class—the Communist Party of China. They all know that the Communist Party of China enjoys unlimited prestige among the Chinese working people. As long as the Communist Party of China always unites and persists in the socialist cause, any of their attacks will inevitably be thoroughly defeated. Therefore, our enemies are constantly racking their brains to use the most unswerving and unreliable elements within the Communist Party, to split our Party, corrode and disintegrate our Party through them, in order to most smoothly realize their conspiracy of counter-revolutionary restoration. American imperialists even do not hide this point; for example, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State said at a meeting of the Appropriations Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives on February 10: "The solution to the problem of mainland China that we hope for is not to attack the mainland, but to use actions that promote internal disintegration."

The emergence of the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance under such a situation of class struggle is certainly not an accidental phenomenon, but a sharp manifestation of the fierce class struggle in our country at the present stage within our Party.

The evil purpose of the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance was to split our Party, to attempt to overthrow the long-tested leadership core of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and to seize the supreme power of the Party and the state. The method they used to achieve this purpose was to carry out conspiratorial activities. This is the most important symbol and program of this anti-Party alliance. This anti-Party alliance knew that all Party comrades and the people of the whole country fully trusted the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. If they openly came out against the leadership of the Party Central Committee, they would immediately expose their counter-revolutionary true colors in front of the whole Party and the people of the whole country, and they would inevitably suffer a shameful defeat. Therefore, not only did they dare not openly put forward any political programs and principles different from the Central Committee, but on the contrary, they repeatedly expressed their support for the Central Committee in formal occasions. But in order to realize their personal counter-revolutionary ambitions, and to meet the needs of imperialists and domestic counter-revolutionary elements, they had to overthrow the leadership of the Central Committee. Then, what methods could they take to achieve their evil purposes? They could only take the conspiratorial methods often adopted by landlords and the bourgeoisie, and take methods of fabricating rumors and deception, sowing discord, buying over followers, inciting division, and preparing to usurp power. They are a unprincipled conspiracy group produced within the Party in the special environment of the current class struggle. The purpose of their anti-Party activities is to pave the way for the restoration of counter-revolution. In fact, they have become agents of the bourgeoisie within our Party.

The Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the Chinese working class and the fighting headquarters leading the socialist cause. If the leadership of the Party is in the hands of conspirators and traitors, if this fighting headquarters is disintegrated and corrupted from within, the result will certainly not be the victory of socialism, but only the victory of capitalism, the restoration of imperialism and all counter-revolutionary forces. At the same time, if our Party allows such conspiratorial activities without giving a thorough blow, it is equivalent to canceling all the political and organizational principles of the Party, which is equivalent to the demise of the Party. There is no doubt that if our Party is to lead the broad masses of the people to realize the great socialist cause, it must wage a resolute and merciless struggle against class enemies outside the Party, and it must and above all must wage a resolute and merciless struggle against class enemies mixed in the Party. This is exactly what our Party is doing: from the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee to this National Conference of the Party, the whole Party, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, has completely exposed all the conspiracies of the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance, and has thoroughly shattered this anti-Party alliance.

Our Party has repeatedly defeated traitors and anti-Party elements in history. In 1927, the Party purged the traitor Chen Duxiu, thereby enabling it to victoriously carry out the struggle in the new period with the countryside as the revolutionary base after the failure of the revolution. In 1935, during the Long March of the Red Army, the Party smashed the conspiracy of the traitor Zhang Guotao to split the Party, thereby enabling it to victoriously complete the great Long March and usher in the new situation of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Now, the victory of the struggle against the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance once again proves that our Party is a strong and invincible Party built in accordance with the ideological and organizational principles of Marxism-Leninism, and proves that our Party is good at clearing out conspirators and traitors from its own ranks, and using the power of unity and solidarity to win the complete victory of the revolutionary cause of the working class. Now, our Party is more firmly united around the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong than ever before, and our Party's combat effectiveness is stronger than ever before, thereby providing the most fundamental guarantee for our people to overcome domestic and foreign enemies and complete the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

Of course, it cannot be considered that everything will be fine after the victory in the struggle against the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance. As pointed out in the "Resolution on the Anti-Party Alliance of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi": "Consolidating the unity and unification of the Party, and timely exposing and smashing the activities of class dissidents to corrupt the Party and split the Party, is a long-term struggle. As long as the international and domestic class struggle still exists, class enemies will always try to influence the wavering and unreliable elements in our Party, and there will always be wavering and unreliable elements in our Party who are influenced by them. Events similar to the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance may still occur in the future." Therefore, summarizing the experience of this struggle and learning lessons from it has become an urgent political task for the whole Party.

The first basic lesson that we should learn from the struggle against the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance is that all Party comrades should always remember the conspiracies of class enemies, and always struggle to safeguard the interests of the Party and the interests of the country. All Party members must strictly abide by the Party Constitution and Party discipline, strictly abide by the various provisions on consolidating the unity and unification of the Party made in the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, and resolutely oppose all kinds of remarks and actions that endanger the unity of the Party. One point that we should be particularly vigilant about is that disputes within the Party must be conducted openly and legally within the Party organization, and sectarian, divisive, and conspiratorial activities must be strictly prohibited. Our Party requires any Party member to faithfully implement all resolutions and instructions of the Party, and at the same time allows debates with different opinions at Party meetings in order to distinguish right from wrong and reach correct conclusions. The Party absolutely prohibits people like Gao Gang and Rao Shushi from using conspiratorial means to conduct activities against this and that behind the back of the Party organization. This kind of activity violates Party discipline, endangers the unity of the Party, and therefore is inevitably anti-Party. Some comrades, after hearing the anti-Party remarks of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi, neither opposed them, nor asked them to formally raise their opinions to the Party organization, nor reported to the Party themselves. This liberal attitude is completely wrong and can only be beneficial to the enemies of the Party. Therefore, all Party comrades must not only ensure that they do not say anything that is harmful to the unity of the Party, and do not do anything that is harmful to the unity of the Party; but also fight against the words and actions of others that endanger the Party, and report to the Party in a timely manner. Only in this way can our Party block all the gaps that anti-Party elements can use within the Party, so that the enemy cannot undermine our Party and the great socialist cause of the people from within.

The second basic lesson is that all Party comrades must earnestly overcome complacency and resolutely oppose the tendency of individualism and the idea of personal worship. The "Resolution on Strengthening the Unity of the Party" of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee stated: "After the victory of the new democratic revolution in China, some cadres in the Party have developed an extremely dangerous sense of pride. They are overwhelmed by some achievements in their work, forgetting the humble attitude and the spirit of self-criticism that Communist Party members must have, exaggerating the role of individuals, emphasizing the prestige of individuals, considering themselves the best in the world, only listening to flattery and praise, not being able to accept criticism and supervision, suppressing and retaliating against critics, and even regarding the areas and departments they lead as personal capital and independent kingdoms." It should be pointed out that the reason why people like Gao Gang and Rao Shushi embarked on the anti-Party road is inseparable from their long-term complacency in their work, their unwillingness to see their own shortcomings and mistakes, and their unwillingness to accept criticism and supervision. It should also be pointed out that some comrades were once used as tools for anti-Party activities by Gao Gang, Rao Shushi, and others, which is also inseparable from these comrades' concerns about personal gains and losses, their attention to personal reputation and status, their individualistic tendencies that put personal interests above the interests of the Party, and their ideas of personal worship that value individuals but do not value collectives. Complacency, individualistic tendencies, and the idea of personal worship will inevitably dilute the principled atmosphere of the Party and inevitably make people lose vigilance against phenomena that endanger the Party, and anti-Party elements and counter-revolutionary elements will inevitably take advantage of the situation. The whole Party comrades must deeply remember this lesson.

The third basic lesson is that our Party must implement strict, regular, and systematic supervision of the work of any Party member (even the most responsible Party member) through a certain organization. Our Party encourages every Party member to fully develop and continuously improve their talents. The Party's supervision is not to restrict the revolutionary enthusiasm of Party members, but to ensure the correct development of this enthusiasm. Without supervision from top to bottom and from bottom to top, a good Party member may also make serious mistakes and even turn bad. Sincerely placing one's work under the supervision of the Party organization instead of placing oneself above the Party organization is a principle that we Communists must abide by. The Party committees at all levels of our Party must earnestly implement the principle of collective leadership and continue to oppose both the tendency of personal dictatorship and the tendency of decentralism. Our Party should conscientiously improve various necessary systems, first of all, establish and strengthen the central government's system of inspection and supervision of various localities throughout the country and superiors' system of inspection and supervision of subordinates, and the system in which the departments managing cadres are also responsible for inspecting the actual work of cadres, so as to ensure that any Party member does work under the supervision of the Party. At the same time, it is necessary to follow the "Resolution of the National Conference of the Communist Party of China on the Establishment of the Central and Local Supervisory Committees of the Party" and quickly establish the supervisory committees of the Party at all levels in order to regularly inspect and deal with various cases of violation of laws and disciplines by Party members and cadres and Party organizations, and to carry out regular and resolute struggles against all bad people and bad deeds that violate the Party Constitution, Party discipline, and state laws and regulations.

The fourth basic lesson is that it is necessary to strengthen the Marxist-Leninist and communist ideological education within the Party, strengthen the Party's ideological work, and continuously carry out systematic struggles against various bourgeois ideologies that corrode our Party. Every Party member should strive to improve their Marxist-Leninist ideological level, improve the "sense of smell" of communists, so that we can keenly discern what is Marxist revolutionary and what is anti-Marxist counter-revolutionary, and understand how to promote the former and combat the latter. While the Party systematically transforms capitalist industry and commerce on the economic front, it must systematically criticize and overcome the influence of bourgeois ideology on the ideological front. The Party requires all qualified Party members to regularly and conscientiously study Marxist-Leninist theory and study dialectical materialism and historical materialism. In this way, our Party can organize a powerful theoretical team with unified steps and sophisticated weapons to defend the socialist revolutionary cause from the ideological front, maintain the unity of the Party, and carry out effective struggles against various bourgeois reactionary ideas.

Our Party shattered the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance at the critical moment of the socialist revolution in our country, which is a historic victory for our Party and the people of our country. All Party comrades should earnestly learn lessons from this incident, constantly consolidate the Party, constantly consolidate the Party's ties with the people, and constantly strengthen the struggle against imperialists and counter-revolutionary elements. In this way, under the strong and effective leadership of our Party, the people of our country will surely be able to achieve the complete victory of the socialist revolution.

    党的历史上的重大胜利
    我们的党在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的领导下，彻底粉碎了高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的阴谋活动，这是我们党和全国人民在为社会主义事业的奋斗中的一个重大的胜利；是我们党的整个发展历史上的一个有决定意义的胜利。
    大家知道，随着新民主主义革命阶段转入社会主义革命阶段，阶级斗争不但不会和缓，反而只会更加复杂，更加尖锐。正如“中国共产党全国代表会议关于高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的决议”中所指出的：“在一方面，中华人民共和国的成立和发展引起了帝国主义首先是美帝国主义的极大的仇视；美帝国主义正在继续侵占我国的领土台湾，并积极利用台湾和其他军事基地对我国进行颠覆活动和准备侵略战争。在另一方面，国内的反革命残余分子和资产阶级中坚决反对社会主义改造的反动分子，随着我国社会主义事业的进展，也正在加紧他们的反革命复辟的阴谋。”无论是外国帝国主义者或是国内的反革命分子，他们都知道要进攻中国人民，最厉害的办法就是首先进攻中国人民和中国工人阶级的领导力量——中国共产党。他们都知道，中国共产党在中国劳动人民中间享有无限的威信，只要中国共产党始终团结一致地坚持着社会主义事业，他们的任何进攻都必然遭到彻底的失败。因此我们的敌人无时无刻不在处心积虑要利用共产党内最不坚定最不可靠的分子，要经过他们来分裂我们的党，腐蚀和瓦解我们的党，以便最顺利地实现他们反革命复辟的阴谋。美国帝国主义者甚至并不隐瞒这一点；例如美国助理国务卿二月十日就在美国众议院拨款委员会的会议上说：“我们所希望的解决中国大陆的问题的办法不是向大陆进攻，而是用促成内部瓦解的行动。”
    在这样的阶级斗争形势下出现了高岗、饶漱石反党联盟，当然不是偶然的现象，而是我国现阶段激烈阶级斗争在我们党内的一种尖锐的表现。
    高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的罪恶目的，是分裂我们的党，是企图推翻以毛泽东同志为首的久经考验的党中央的领导核心，来夺取党和国家的最高权力，他们用以达到这个目的的方法是进行阴谋活动。这就是这个反党联盟的最主要的标志和纲领。这个反党联盟知道全党同志和全国人民对于以毛泽东同志为首的党中央是充分信任的，如果他们公开地出来反对党中央的领导，便要立刻在全党和全国人民面前暴露他们反革命的真面目，他们便必然遭到可耻的失败。因此他们不但不敢公开提出什么同中央不同的政纲和原则，而且相反，他们在正式的场所还口口声声地拥护中央。但是他们为了实现个人的反革命野心，为了适应帝国主义者和国内反革命分子的需要，又非要推翻中央的领导不可，那末，他们能采取什么方法来达到他们的罪恶目的呢？他们就只能采取地主资产阶级所常采取的阴谋方法来活动，采取造谣欺骗、挑拨离间、收买党羽、煽动分裂、准备篡夺的方法来活动。他们是目前阶级斗争的特殊环境中在党内产生的毫无原则的阴谋集团，他们的这种反党活动的目的就是为反革命的复辟开辟道路。他们在实际上成了资产阶级在我们党内的代理人。
    中国共产党是中国工人阶级的先锋队，是领导社会主义事业的战斗司令部。如果党的领导权掌握在阴谋家和叛徒的手里，如果这个战斗司令部从内部被瓦解和被腐蚀，其结果当然就不是什么社会主义的胜利，而只能是资本主义的胜利，是帝国主义和一切反革命势力的复辟。同时，如果我们党内容许了这种阴谋活动而不给予彻底的打击，那就等于取消了党的一切政治原则和组织原则，那就等于党的灭亡。毫无疑问，我们的党要领导广大人民来实现伟大的社会主义事业，就必须同党外的阶级敌人进行坚决无情的斗争，就必须而且首先必须同混在党内的阶级敌人进行坚决无情的斗争。我们党正是这样做的：从七届四中全会到这次党的全国代表会议，全党在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的领导下，已经完全揭露了高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的一切阴谋，已经彻底地粉碎了这个反党联盟。
    我们党在历史上曾经多次战胜叛徒和反党分子。在一九二七年，党清除了叛徒陈独秀分子，从而能够在革命失败后的严重形势下胜利地开展了以农村为革命根据地的新时期的斗争。在一九三五年红军长征中，党又粉碎了叛徒张国焘分裂党的阴谋，从而能够胜利地完成伟大的长征，迎接抗日战争的新形势的到来。现在，反对高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的斗争的胜利，又一次证明了我们的党是按照马克思列宁主义的思想原则和组织原则而建设起来的坚强的不可战胜的党，证明了我们的党善于从自己队伍内部清除阴谋家和叛徒，并用统一和团结的力量来争取工人阶级革命事业的彻底胜利。现在，我们的党比以往任何时候更加巩固地团结在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的周围，我们的党的战斗力比以往任何时候更要强大，从而就使我国人民在战胜内外敌人、完成社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业上获得了最根本的保证。
    当然不能认为，在同高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的斗争中取得了胜利以后就万事大吉了。正如“关于高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的决议”中所指出的：“巩固党的团结和统一，及时地揭露和粉碎阶级异已分子腐蚀党和分裂党的活动，这是一个长时期的斗争。只要国际和国内的阶级斗争仍然存在，阶级的敌人总是会要设法影响我们党内的不坚定的和不可靠的分子，而我们党内也总会有不坚定的和不可靠的分子受他们的影响。和高岗、饶漱石反党联盟相类似的事件今后还可能出现。”因此，总结这一斗争的经验，并从中得到教训，便成为全党的迫切的政治任务。
    从对高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的斗争中我们应当得到的第一个基本教训，就是全党同志时时刻刻记着阶级敌人的阴谋，时时刻刻为维护党的利益和国家的利益而斗争。所有的党员必须严格地遵守党章党纪，严格地遵守七届四中全会决议中所作的关于巩固党的团结统一的各项规定，坚决地反对各种危害党的团结的言论和行动。我们特别应该警觉到的一点，就是党内的争论必须在党的组织内公开合法地进行，必须严格禁止宗派的、分裂的、阴谋的活动。我们党要求任何党员忠实地执行党的一切决议和指示，同时容许在党的会议上有不同意见的争论，以便分清是非，达到正确的结论。党绝对禁止像高岗、饶漱石那样，用阴谋家的手段背着党的组织，暗中进行反对这个反对那个的活动。这种活动是违反党的纪律、危害党的统一的，因此必然是反党的。曾经有些同志在听到高岗、饶漱石的反党言论以后，既不加以反对，也不要求他们把意见正式地提到党的组织中来，自己也不向党报告，这种自由主义态度是完全错误的，只能有利于党的敌人的。因此，全党同志不但要保证自己不说有害于党的团结的话，不做有害于党的团结的事；而且要向别人的危害党的言论和行动作斗争，并且及时地向党报告。只有这样，我们党才能堵塞反党分子在党内所能利用的一切空隙，使敌人无法从内部来破坏我们的党和人民的伟大社会主义事业。
    第二个基本教训就是全党同志必须认真克服骄傲自满情绪，坚决反对个人主义倾向和个人崇拜的思想。七届四中全会“关于增强党的团结的决议”中说：“在中国新民主主义革命胜利后，党内一部分干部滋长着一种极端危险的骄傲情绪，他们因为工作中的若干成绩就冲昏了头脑，忘记了共产党员所必须具有的谦逊态度和自我批评精神，夸大个人的作用，强调个人的威信，自以为天下第一，只能听人奉承赞扬，不能受人批评监督，对批评者实行压制和报复，甚至把自己所领导的地区和部门看作个人的资本和独立王国。”应当指出，高岗、饶漱石之流所以走上反党的道路，同他们长期间在工作中骄傲自满、不愿意看到自己的缺点错误、不愿意受人批评监督的恶劣倾向是分不开的。同时也应当指出，有些同志曾经被高岗、饶漱石等人当作反党活动的工具，这也是同这些同志的患得患失、计较名誉地位、把个人利益放在党的利益之上的个人主义倾向和他们的重视个人而不重视集体的个人崇拜思想分不开的。骄傲自满情绪、个人主义倾向和个人崇拜思想都必然使党的原则空气稀薄起来，都必然使人们对危害党的现象失去警惕，而反党分子和反革命分子就必然乘虚而入。这个教训，全党同志必须深刻记取。
    第三个基本教训就是我们的党必须经过一定的组织对任何一个党员（那怕是最负责的党员）的工作实行严格的、经常的、有系统的监督。我们的党是鼓励每个党员充分发挥和不断提高自己的才智的，党的监督不是为着限制党员的革命积极性，而正是为着保证这种积极性的正确的发展。没有由上而下的和由下而上的的监督，一个好的党员也可能犯严重的错误以至变坏。诚诚恳恳地把自己的工作摆在党组织的监督之下而不是相反地把自己摆在党组织之上，这是我们共产党人必须遵守的原则。我们党的各级党委都必须认真地执行集体领导的原则，继续反对个人独裁和分散主义两种倾向。我们党应当切实健全各种必要的制度，首先是建立和加强中央对全国各地方和上级对下级的巡视检查制度，管理干部的部门同时负责检查干部的实际工作的制度，以保证任何党员都在党的监督下面做工作。同时，必须遵照“中国共产党全国代表会议关于成立党的中央和地方监察委员会的决议”，迅速地建立党的各级监察委员会，以便经常检查和处理党员干部和党的组织各种违法乱纪案件，同一切违反党章党纪和国家法律法令的坏人坏事进行经常的坚决的斗争。
    第四个基本教训就是必须加强党内的马克思列宁主义、共产主义的思想教育，加强党的思想工作，不断地同腐蚀我们党的各种资产阶级思想进行有系统的斗争。每一个党员都应当努力提高自己马克思列宁主义的思想水平，提高共产主义者的“嗅觉”，使我们能够敏锐地鉴别什么是马克思主义的革命的东西，什么是反马克思主义的反革命的东西，懂得怎样去发扬前一种东西，打击后一种东西。党必须在经济战线上有系统地改造资本主义工商业的同时，在思想战线上有系统地批判和战胜资产阶级思想的影响。党要求一切有条件的党员经常地认真学习马克思列宁主义理论，学习辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义。这样，我们的党才有可能组织一个步调一致、武器精良的强大的理论队伍来从思想战线上维护社会主义革命事业，维护党的统一，同各种资产阶级反动思想进行有效的斗争。
    我们的党在我国社会主义革命的紧要关头粉碎了高岗、饶漱石反党联盟，这是我们党和我国人民的历史性的胜利。我们全党同志应当从这一事件认真地得到教训，不断地巩固党，不断地巩固党和人民的联系，不断地加强对于帝国主义者和反革命分子的斗争，这样，在我们党的坚强有力的领导下，我国人民就一定能够取得社会主义革命的彻底胜利。
