Build More Factories, Less Auditoriums!
    Shao Yanxiang
    Look, what a dense array of scaffolding, tomorrow a factory building will appear here. This factory is truly extraordinary, sending out millions of machine tools from here. Day and night, we hand over shifts, no idle people in our place. …… Yet, two enormous buildings stand on either side of the future factory: one wearing a big hat with five ridges and six beasts, the other dressed in bizarre and outlandish clothes; whenever we are working hard, they cast a watching gaze. One is an auditorium, and the other is still an auditorium, empty for twenty-nine days a month. The designer has erected his "monument." The "generous benefactor" has displayed his extravagance. How much of the people's blood and sweat has been wasted! Ah, if this money were used to build factories... Is socialist industry built on the springy leather seats of auditoriums? Our great cause is just beginning, build more factories, less auditoriums!

### 多盖些工厂，少盖些礼堂！

    多盖些工厂，少盖些礼堂！
    邵燕祥看，好一片密密层层的脚手架，明天这里要出现一片厂房。这一座工厂真不平常，从这里要送出千万台机床。日日夜夜我们交班换岗，没有闲人，在我们的地方。…………偏偏有两幢庞大的建筑站起在未来的工厂两旁：一个戴着五脊六兽的大帽子，一个穿着稀奇古怪的花衣裳；每当我们紧张劳动的时分，它们却投来旁观的眼光。一个是礼堂，一个还是礼堂，一个月有二十九天空空荡荡。设计家树立了自己的“纪念碑”。“慷慨家”摆出了自己的排场。浪费了人民多少血汗钱！啊，如果用这些钱来盖工厂……社会主义的工业，难道说，建筑在礼堂的弹簧皮座椅上？我们伟大的事业刚在开端，多盖些工厂，少盖些礼堂！
