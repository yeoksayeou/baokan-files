    Good Crops Have Grown
    In Songyuan Village, Matang Township, Wuhu County, Anhui Province, 120 mu of land that had produced very low yields for several years has grown good crops again in 1955. Now, the rapeseed and wheat seedlings on this land are growing very luxuriantly.
    These 120 mu of fertile land in Songyuan Village belong to twenty-nine poor peasant families. After the floods in 1949, although they received a large amount of relief grain and agricultural loans from the state, these poor peasants were still individual households at that time. Because they were unable to drain water and lacked draught cattle and seeds, they could not sow the land. The following year, due to a lack of agricultural capital for fertilization after the floods, they had to scatter seeds and "hope for rain". For three consecutive years, the crops on this fertile land could no longer grow well, and the yield was very low.
    Last year, this area suffered another major flood. However, the village organized an agricultural production cooperative, and these twenty-nine poor peasant families all became members of the cooperative. When planting in the autumn, the land was still covered in white water. The male and female members of the cooperative organized to drain the water and rush to plant. When there were not enough draught animals, the members with strong labor power used manpower to deliver manure, allowing the draught animals to concentrate on plowing the fields, ensuring the timely sowing of all the land. Then, the cooperative used a portion of its sideline income to buy more than 1,200 dan of manure to apply to this land. Later, they hoed the grass again, eliminating the phenomenon of "grass and seedlings growing together" that had occurred in previous years. Thus, this land became fertile land again.

    长出了好庄稼
    安徽省芜湖县马塘乡松园村有一百二十亩几年来产量很低的田地，一九五五年又长出好庄稼了。现在这块土地上的油菜、麦苗长得十分茂盛。
    松园村这一百二十亩良田，是二十九家贫农的。在一九四九年水灾后，他们虽然得到国家大量的救济粮和农业贷款，但当时这些贫农还都是单干户，因为无力排水和缺乏耕牛、种籽，所以不能下种。第二年又因为水灾后缺少农本施肥，只好撒下种籽
  “望天收”。这样连续三年，这片肥沃的土地上的庄稼就再也长不好了，产量很低。
    去年，这儿又遭到特大洪水。但是，村里组织了农业生产合作社，这二十九家贫农都成了合作社的社员，秋种时，这片土地里还是白茫茫的积水，合作社的男、女社员就组织起来排水抢种；耕畜不够用，劳动力强的社员就用人力来送粪，让耕畜集中力量耕田，保证了所有土地的及时播种。接着合作社又用副业收入的一部分买了一千二百多担粪施到这片土地上。后来又多锄了一遍草，消灭了历年来“草苗齐长”的现象。于是这片土地又变成良田了。　　　　　（新华社）
