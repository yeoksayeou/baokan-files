The Light Industry Department's Supply and Marketing General Bureau recently inspected the production and sales balance of state-owned light industrial products and found that some products were in oversupply. It is estimated that the total value of stockpiled products by the end of this year will greatly exceed the stockpiled amount at the end of last year. The main stockpiled products include automobile tires, V-belts, transmission belts, cigarette paper, coated paper, reed pulp, and so on. The stockpiling of products will have serious consequences. The stockpiling of products the year before last caused some factories to have no place to store their products, their capital turnover was sluggish, they had no money to buy raw materials, and no funds to pay wages. The stockpiling of products last year caused some factories to shut down and reduce production, causing huge losses to the state. According to statistics from three state-owned rubber factories alone, the losses caused by shutdowns in the fourth quarter of last year were more than 1 million yuan. If this year's product stockpiling is not dealt with promptly, it will have even more serious consequences, which is obvious.

Why is there a product stockpiling? First of all, the planning is poor. The supply and marketing departments have no idea about the overall production and sales situation. Even if there is an investigation, there is little research. They only passively "promote sales after production" and deal with stockpiled products, but they do not actively study the actual needs of society and strive for "pre-production balance." For the commercial departments' all-inclusive sales plan for materials, they just "parrot others" and "mediate rumors." The work is a "passive battle." The suggestions made by the supply and marketing departments to production are often very incorrect, resulting in high production plans. The 1954 automobile tire production plan was based on the suggestions made by the supply and marketing bureau. What was the basis for the supply and marketing bureau's suggestions? Based on the demand plans submitted by users. However, when the supply and marketing bureau made suggestions for tire production, it did not carefully study the growth rate of product sales over the years and calculate the users' demand plans, but blindly followed the users. The more the users wanted, the more the supply and marketing bureau planned to give. For example, the China Traffic Electrical Equipment Company's purchase plan at the beginning of last year increased by 60% compared with the actual purchase amount of the previous year. The supply and marketing bureau did not consider whether the purchase speed was increasing too fast, and suggested that the production department produce according to the plan. In the second half of the year, after the Traffic Electrical Equipment Company reduced orders, a large number of products were stockpiled, and the factory had to reduce production. At the beginning of last year, there was a false shortage of cigarette paper. The supply and marketing department mistakenly believed that the annual production was insufficient, so it suggested that the Minhua Feng Paper Mill increase production. But soon, it was learned that the market inventory was very large, and the production of cigarettes was reduced by 100,000 cases. Therefore, it was suggested that the Minhua Feng Factory reduce production and the Anhui Paper Factory slow down production. Although some production was reduced, the overall production plan was too high, resulting in stockpiling. In the past, some factories failed to seriously implement the principle of production and sales balance in production plan management, focusing only on accelerating the production speed of certain products, while considering less the actual needs of society. Coated paper was already stockpiled in 1953, and the 1954 plan was larger than the 1953 performance, and the actual annual output was more than 3,000 tons higher than the plan, resulting in serious stockpiling.

Secondly, in the process of implementing the production plan, some factories simply pursue the completion and over fulfillment of output and output value targets, and are only willing to produce those varieties and specifications that are large in quantity, high in profit, and easy to produce, and are unwilling to produce those varieties and specifications that are small in quantity, low in profit, and difficult to produce. Some factories even change the plan on their own and blindly produce, resulting in the state's needed varieties and specifications not being met, while the unnecessary ones are stockpiled. In the fourth quarter of last year, the commercial department required the state-owned Shanghai Pharmaceutical Factory to produce 1.76 million ampules of distilled water, but the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Factory only produced 70,000 ampules and stopped producing. Later, in order to make up for the output value plan, it produced 2 million ampules of testosterone propionate, progesterone, and ephedrine hydrochloride on its own. Why did it change to producing these products? Mainly because these products were "profitable" (the profit of testosterone, etc., was more than 100%). Unfortunately, after the products were produced, the profit was not earned, but the capital was lost first, because the Shanghai station of the pharmaceutical company had enough inventory of these products to sell for several years. In the second quarter of last year, the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant urgently needed Soviet-style V-belts and required the state-owned rubber factory to produce them. The Rubber Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry instructed Rubber Factory No. 1 to supply them, but Rubber Factory No. 1 said that it would not be able to supply them until June 1956, that is, two years later. The poor quality of some products also affects sales. For example, the roofing felt base paper produced by the Shenyang Paper Mill last year had too much moisture, too many breaks, uneven thickness, and impurities such as cottonseed skins and coal slag, and the packaging was not good. Even in the case of supply falling short of demand, the users returned the goods twice. Some penicillin and some rubber products also affected sales due to poor quality.

Finally, the commercial departments' lack of knowledge of the market situation and the insufficient accuracy of commercial purchase and sales plans are also one of the reasons for the stockpiling of light industrial products. The market supply plans of some commercial departments change frequently, sometimes high and sometimes low, sometimes large and sometimes small. When sales are good, they ask for increased production everywhere, and the more they purchase, the better. When sales are sluggish, they ask for reduced production everywhere, and the less they purchase, the better. For example, for a certain specification of automobile tires, the China Traffic Electrical Equipment Company was unwilling to purchase them in the first half of the year before last, but in the second half of the year, it requested the factory to increase production three times. In the first half of last year, it insisted on increasing orders, but in the second half of the year, it asked to reduce purchases. The company's 1955 tire purchase plan only accounted for 65% of the actual purchase volume in 1954. For example, the China Hardware Machinery Company reduced its orders for tape even more surprisingly: this year's purchase volume of transmission belts was 65% lower than last year's; the purchase volume of V-belts was even less, accounting for only 8% of last year's purchase volume. In this way, after the industrial sector has no way to expand sales, it will inevitably shut down and reduce production.

In order to avoid the stockpiling of industrial products in the future and strive for a balance between production and sales, we believe that efforts should be made in two aspects. On the one hand, we should overcome blindness and strengthen planning. In the supply and marketing departments, we should strengthen the investigation and research on demand, so as to "have a clear idea" and correctly compile the production and sales balance plan. In the commercial departments, we should gradually grasp the market laws, improve business management, and improve the accuracy of commercial purchase and sales plans. In the production management department, we should seriously implement the principle of production and sales balance and arrange production comprehensively according to the demand situation. For products with oversupply, we should not blindly increase production. On the other hand, we should strengthen the cooperation and collaboration between the industrial and commercial departments, establish an overall perspective, and oppose departmentalism. Whether it is the industrial department or the commercial department, we should proceed from the overall interests, not from the local interests. The commercial department should strive to promote industrial products, and the industrial department should actively try out new products, actively produce products needed by users, improve product quality, and strive to meet the needs of the national construction cause.

    某些轻工业品积压的原因在哪里
    李生　保林
    轻工业部供销总局最近检查了国营轻工业产品产销平衡情况，发现部分产品供过于求。预计到今年末积压产品总值将大大超过去年年末的积压量。积压的主要品种有汽车轮胎、三角带、传动带、卷烟盘纸、有光纸、苇浆等等。产品的积压将造成严重的后果。前年的产品积压曾使部分工厂产品无处存放，资金周转不灵，无钱购买原料，无款发放工资。去年的产品积压曾使部分工厂停工减产，给国家造成巨大损失。仅据三个国营橡胶厂统计，去年第四季度由于停工所造成的损失约一○○万元以上。今年的产品积压，如得不到及早处理，将会产生更严重恶果，这是很显然的。
    为什么会造成产品积压呢？这首先是计划性差，供销部门对全面产销情况心中无数，纵有调查，也少研究，只知被动地“产后推销”，处理积压产品，但不会主动地研究社会实际需要，力求“产前平衡”。对于商业部门包销物资计划，只是“人云亦云”和“中闻说合”而已。工作中打的是“被动仗”。供销部门对生产提出的建议常常很不正确，造成生产计划偏高。一九五四年的汽车轮胎生产计划，是根据供销局提出的建议为基础制定的。供销局根据什么提出建议呢？根据用户提出的需用计划。可是供销局在提出轮胎生产建议时，并没有很好研究历年产品销售增长比例，核算用户需用计划，而是盲目地跟着用户跑，用户要得多，供销局就打算给得多。如中国交通电工器材公司在去年年初提出的进货计划比前年实际进货量增加百分之六十，供销局没考虑进货速度是否增长太快，就建议生产部门照产。到下半年，交通电工器材公司减少订货后，产品大量积压，工厂不得不减产。在去年年初，卷烟盘纸发生了虚假的脱销现象，供销部门就误认为全年产不敷销，于是就建议民华丰纸厂增产。但不久，了解到市场的存量很大，卷烟的生产又减产十万箱，于是，又建议民华丰厂减产，安徽纸厂缓产。虽然减产了一部分，但由于整个生产计划偏高，结果还是造成积压。某些工厂在生产计划管理方面，过去未能认真贯彻产销平衡的原则，对某些产品只着重于加快生产速度，而少考虑社会的实际需要。有光纸在一九五三年已有积压，而一九五四年计划又大于一九五三年实绩，且全年实际产量又高出计划三千多吨，致造成严重积压。
    其次，是部分工厂在生产计划执行过程中，单纯追求产量、产值指标的完成和超额完成，只愿产那些量大、利厚、容易生产的品种和规格，不愿生产那些量小、利低、难产的品种和规格。有的工厂甚至自行改变计划，盲目生产，致国家需要的品种、规格不能满足，而不需要的则又积压。去年第四季度，商业部门要求国营上海制药一厂生产蒸馏水一七六万支，上海制药一厂只生产了七万支就不产了，后来为了弥补产值计划，就自行生产丙酸睾丸素、黄体酮、盐酸麻黄素二百万支。为什么改产这些产品呢？主要因为这些产品“有利可图”（睾丸素等利润均在百分之百以上）。可惜，产品生产出来后利没有赚到，倒先蚀了本，因为这些产品，医药公司上海站库存就足够销几年了。去年第二季度，哈尔滨量具刃具厂急需苏联式三角带，要求国营橡胶厂生产。轻工业部橡胶工业管理局指示橡胶一厂供应，而橡胶一厂表示要到一九五六年六月，即两年以后才能供应。部分产品质量不好，也影响销路。例如沈阳造纸厂去年生产的油毡原纸，水分多，断头多，厚薄不匀，纸内有棉子皮和煤渣等杂质，而且包装又不好，在供不应求的情况下，仍两度遭到用户退货。部分青霉素和部分橡胶产品也因质量不好而影响销路。
    最后，商业部门对市场情况不摸底，商业购销计划的准确性不够，也是造成轻工业产品积压的原因之一。部分商业部门的市场供应计划经常变动，忽高忽低，时大时小，畅销时到处要求增产，且收购得愈多愈好；而滞销时则四出要求减产，收购得愈少愈好。如对某种规格的汽车轮胎，中国交通电工器材公司在前年上半年不愿进货，但到下半年则三次要求工厂增产；到去年上半年坚持增加订货，下半年则又要求减少进货。这个公司一九五五年的轮胎进货计划只占一九五四年实际进货量的百分之六十五。再如中国五金机械公司，对胶带订货更减少得出奇：今年传动带进货量比去年减少了百分之六十五；三角带的进货量更少到仅占去年进货量的百分之八。这样，工业部门在扩大销路无门后，势必停工减产。
    为了避免今后工业品积压，争取产销平衡，我们认为应从两方面努力。一方面，应该克服盲目性，加强计划性。在供销部门，应该加强对需求情况的调查研究，做到“心中有数”，正确编制产销平衡计划。在商业部门，应逐步掌握市场规律，改善经营管理，提高商业购销计划的准确性。在生产管理部门，应认真贯彻产销平衡的原则，根据需求情况，全面安排生产。对于供过于求的产品，即不应盲目增产。另一方面应该加强工业和商业部门之间的配合和协作，树立全面观点，反对本位主义思想，无论工业部门，商业部门，都应从整体利益出发，而不要从局部利益出发，商业部门应努力推销工业产品，工业部门应积极试制新产品，积极生产用户需要的产品，提高产品质量，努力满足国家建设事业的需要。
