Saving 360,000 Jin of Sorghum Rice
　　By Our Correspondent Fang Qing

　　Although Luo Zhenjiang grew up in the countryside, he had been working at the Keshan Grain Processing Factory in Heilongjiang for twenty-two years and had not been to the countryside for a long time. In the winter of 1953, in order to celebrate with the farmers, he and some workers stayed in Shengli Village, Keshan County, for three days. At that time, the village was busy with autumn harvesting and threshing. He witnessed how carefully the farmers threshed, sifted, and winnowed, and how they picked grains from broken leaves. He also saw that the farmers kept chickens and ducks penned up and did not allow them to enter the threshing ground at all. Even the livestock wore "muzzles" and could not eat a single grain, not to mention how frugal the farmers were in their consumption of grain.

　　These facts greatly educated Luo Zhenjiang. He thought: "In order to support industrial construction, the peasant brothers are trying every possible means to increase grain production and not to waste a single grain. When I am at the processing plant, the Party often calls on us to increase the rice yield and save grain. I am a technician in the grain workshop, but I have not improved the rice yield. Speaking of which, I am really sorry to the peasant brothers."

　　With this feeling, Luo Zhenjiang returned to the factory, repeatedly thinking about the few words said by the Party branch secretary: "Grain is the most valuable material force for building socialism. With grain, we can develop industry and consolidate national defense..." When he arrived at the processing plant and saw the grain again, he felt the loveliness of the grain even more. He immediately discussed with the workers how to improve the rice yield. At this time, everyone was complaining that the quality of sorghum was not good, which affected the rice yield, which was only 55% (5.5 jin of sorghum rice out of 10 jin of sorghum). Luo Zhenjiang thought, "The rainfall in northern Manchuria was heavy in 1953, and the quality of sorghum is low. This is a fact; but, is there no problem with our grinding machines?" He walked back and forth around the electric grinding machine for sorghum rice, sometimes crouching down to listen to the sound of the machine, and sometimes holding up the ground rice to observe carefully. Finally, he found broken rice in the bran and confirmed that this was the reason for the low rice yield.

　　At the workshop technical research meeting, Luo Zhenjiang pointed out that broken rice was found in the bran and mobilized everyone to find the reason for the broken rice. Everyone agreed to disassemble the grinding machine for inspection. As a result, they found two reasons: first, there was a gap of more than two millimeters between the "vertical ring" and the "pressing strip", so that slightly smaller sorghum rice would fall down and be crushed; second, some small edges and corners of the grinding wheel also easily crushed the rice. They corrected these two problems, and the rice yield immediately reached 61%.

　　Next, Luo Zhenjiang participated in the Northeast Sorghum Rice Processing Conference, and learned two more experiences: one was that the speed of the grinding machine was too fast, and the grinding wheel easily crushed the rice. Reducing the speed from more than 700 revolutions per minute to more than 600 revolutions per minute could overcome this problem. The other was that in the operation process of eight continuous grinding machines, the first four grinding machines could use coarse grinding wheels, and from the fifth grinding machine onwards, fine grinding wheels should be used, which would also produce much less broken rice. At the same time, the Provincial Grain Bureau instructed to separate the large and small grains for "separate grain processing." In this way, they quickly increased the rice yield to 63%.

　　In October 1954, Luo Zhenjiang's thinking was further motivated - he was accepted into the Party as a Communist Party member, which made him even more unwilling to rest on his existing achievements. He took the bran again and carefully checked it, and found that there was still flour in the bran. Therefore, he further studied with the workers and found that the rice sieves were too narrow, the rice could not be shaken open, and the bran could not be sifted down. They changed the sieves from 60 cm wide to 80 cm wide; worker Zheng Wen also transformed the "windlass return" according to this principle, which not only increased the rice yield to 73%, but also reduced the electrical load. In 1954, the quality of sorghum produced in Keshan improved. Luo Zhenjiang also modified the grinding machine according to the improved quality of the new raw grain. This February, he has increased the rice yield to 75%.

　　The factory calculated their achievements in improving the rice yield according to the actual records. In 1954, they saved a total of 360,000 jin of sorghum rice for the country.

　　Luo Zhenjiang is constantly moving forward and constantly achieving new successes. He has been selected as a first-class labor model in grain processing in Heilongjiang Province. He affirmed: "There will be potential in grain processing, and we must continue to use our brains to find tricks, and we must not let the grain produced by the peasant brothers be wasted in our hands."

    节省三十六万斤高粱米
  　本报记者　方青
    罗振江小时虽然是在农村长大的，但他已经在黑龙江克山粮谷加工厂干了二十二年，长期没有到过农村了。一九五三年冬天，为了同农民联欢，他和一些工人一块到克山县胜利村住了三天。当时村里正在忙着秋收打场，他亲眼看到了农民怎样仔细地打场、过筛子、扬场，怎样从碎叶里挑拣粮食；还看到农民把鸡鸭都圈了起来，根本不让它们进场院，牲口都带着“箍嘴”，也吃不到一口粮食，更不用说农民在食用方面是怎样节约粮食了。
    这些事实给罗振江很大教育。他想：农民弟兄们为了支援工业建设，想尽一切办法增产粮食，不糟蹋一颗粮食。我在加工厂时，党经常号召提高出米率，节约粮食，自己是粮谷车间的技工，却没有把出米率提高，说起来，真是对不起农民弟兄。
    罗振江怀着这样的心情回到工厂时，心里反复想着党支部书记说的几句话：“粮食是建设社会主义最宝贵的物质力量，有了粮食就可以发展工业，巩固国防……”他到了加工厂，再看到粮食时，就越发感觉到粮食的可爱，马上同工人们研究怎么提高出米率。这时大家正在埋怨高粱质量不好，影响到出米率只有五成五（十斤高粱中出五点五斤高粱米）。罗振江想：“一九五三年北满雨水大，高粱质量低，这是事实；但是，我们的碾子就没有一点毛病吗？”他围着碾高粱米的电力碾子来回转，有时爬下听机器的声音，有时捧起碾好的米仔细观察，最后在糠里发现有碎米，就肯定这是出米率低的原因。　　在车间技术研究会上，罗振江提出在糠里发现碎米，并发动大家找碎米的原因，大家一致同意拆开碾子检查。结果，他们找出了两个原因：一是“立圈”和“压条”之间有两米厘多的空隙，这样稍微小一点的高粱米，就会掉下去碾碎；二是砂轮有些小的棱角，也容易把米磨碎。他们把这两个毛病纠正了，出米率马上达到了六成一。
    接着，罗振江参加了全东北的高粱米加工会议，又学到了两条经验：一条是碾子的转速太快，砂轮容易把米撞碎，由每分钟七百多转减到六百多转就可以克服这个毛病。另一条是在一连八盘碾子的操作过程中，前面四盘碾子可以用粗砂轮，从第五盘碾子开始，就应该用细砂轮，这样也会少出很多碎米。同时省粮食厅又指示把大小粒分开，进行“分粒加工”。这样他们很快又把出米率提高到了六成三。
    一九五四年十月，罗振江思想上又增加了一种新的动力——他被党接收为共产党员，越发使他不甘心停留在已有的成绩上。他又把糠拿过来，仔细检查，发现糠里还有面的成分。于是，他进一步同工人们研究，发觉原来溜米的筛子太窄，米抖不开，糠筛不下去，他们就把筛子从六十公分宽改成八十公分宽；工人郑文也根据这个道理改造了
  “风车回溜”，这样就不仅把出米率提高到七成三，而且减轻了电力负荷。一九五四年克山生产的高粱质量提高了，罗振江又根据新原粮质量提高的情况改装了碾子，今年二月，他已经把出米率提高到七成五。
    厂里把他们提高出米率的成绩，按照实际记录累计起来，一九五四年总共给国家节省了三十六万斤高粱米。
    罗振江就这样不断地前进，不断地获得新的成绩。他已被选为黑龙江省粮谷加工一等劳动模范，他肯定地说：“粮谷加工方面还会有潜在力量，要靠我们继续开动脑筋，找窍门，决不能让农民兄弟生产的粮食在我们手里糟蹋一点。”
