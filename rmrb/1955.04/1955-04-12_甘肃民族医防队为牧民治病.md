The four teams of the Gansu Provincial Ethnic Medical Prevention Team have successively departed from Lanzhou and will go to the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region, the Sunan Yugur Autonomous Region, and the Mongolian Autonomous Region to carry out venereal disease prevention and treatment of general diseases for herdsmen.

In the past, they used the "fifteen-day treatment" to treat syphilis for herdsmen, and most of the patients' symptoms were alleviated after treatment. This year, in order to further reduce the harm of syphilis to herdsmen, the "penicillin bismuth arsenic mixed thirty-day treatment" will be carried out in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region and the Mongolian Autonomous Region. In the Sunan Yugur Autonomous Region, the "syphilis eradication method" will be adopted based on advanced Soviet experience to completely eliminate syphilis.

Before the medical prevention team set off, in addition to learning the Soviet method of eliminating syphilis, they were also equipped with many medical devices that were not previously available, such as refrigerators, electric incubators, incubators, dry ovens, and operating tables. These medical devices will help them better diagnose and treat diseases.

    甘肃民族医防队为牧民治病
    甘肃省民族医防队四个大队已陆续由兰州出发，将分别到甘南藏族自治区、肃南裕固族自治区和蒙古自治区为牧民进行性病防治和一般病症的治疗。
    过去他们给牧民治疗梅毒是采用“十五日疗法”，治疗后患者病症大部分减轻。今年为了进一步减轻梅毒对牧民的危害，在甘南藏族自治区和蒙古自治区，将进行“青霉素铋砒混合三十日疗法”。在肃南裕固族自治区，将根据苏联先进经验，采用“驱梅法”，以彻底消灭梅毒。
    医防队出发之前，除学习了苏联消灭梅毒的方法以外，还配备了许多以前所没有的医疗器械，如电冰箱、电温箱、保温箱、干烤箱和手术台等。这些医疗器械将帮助他们更好地进行诊断和治疗。
