Construction of Beijing No. 3 Cotton Textile Mill Begins

The state-owned Beijing No. 3 Cotton Textile Mill officially commenced construction on the 22nd.

This is the third new cotton textile mill built in the capital since 1953. Its production capacity is equivalent to that of the No. 2 Cotton Textile Mill, and twice as large as the No. 1 Cotton Textile Mill. All machinery and equipment are designed and manufactured domestically, boasting a high degree of automation and production efficiency. Workshop labor conditions fully meet the standards of advanced textile mills. In the future, in addition to producing shirting and fine cloth, it will also produce yarn-dyed drill and yarn-dyed serge, which are popular and affordable among urban working people.

During construction, prefabricated reinforced concrete components will be used, accounting for more than 70% of the total reinforced concrete work. The manufacture of these prefabricated components began in the processing plant last December, and half of the required quantity has already been completed. After discussing this year's construction progress and work plan, the workers building the mill decided to adopt various methods to reduce the cost of materials and labor for this year's project by 540,000 yuan compared to the designed quota.

Future production team leaders and maintenance workers for each workshop are currently undergoing training. Key cadres from various functional departments have also been transferred from cotton textile mills in Qingdao to fill positions. Key engineering and technical personnel have arrived at the mill and are currently reviewing designs related to workshop layout, technological processes, labor organization, and more.

    北京第三棉纺织厂开工兴建
    国营北京第三棉纺织厂二十二日正式动工兴建。
    这是首都自一九五三年起新建的第三座棉纺织厂。它的生产能力，相当于第二棉纺织厂，比第一棉纺织厂大一倍。所有机器设备，全是我国自己设计、自己制造的，自动化程度和生产效率都很高。车间劳动条件完全合乎先进纺织厂的标准。它将来除生产市布、细布外，还有城市劳动人民喜爱的、价格较低的纱直贡和纱哔叽。
    这个厂在施工中采用装配式的钢筋混凝土预制构件，将占全部钢筋混凝土工程的百分之七十以上。这些预制构件，去年十二月份就已开始在加工厂制造，目前已完成需用量的一半。建筑这个厂的职工们，在讨论了今年的施工进度和工作计划后，决定采取各种办法，使今年工程的工料费比设计定额减少五十四万元。
    各车间未来的生产组长和保全工人正在训练。各职能科室的主要干部，也已从青岛各棉纺织厂抽调配齐。主要的工程技术人员都已到厂，目前正在审查关于车间布置、工艺过程、劳动组织等设计。 （新华社）
