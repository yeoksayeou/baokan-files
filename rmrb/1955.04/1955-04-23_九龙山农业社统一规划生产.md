The Jiulong Mountain Agricultural Production Cooperative, located in the mountainous area of Junlian County, Sichuan, has land stretching from the mountain top to the foot. The slopes are steep, the soil is thin, and the farmers have a habit of "planting extensively but harvesting little," resulting in low agricultural income. This year, the cooperative members studied the experience of the Shanxi Li Shunda Agricultural Production Cooperative in "turning poor mountains into rich mountains." Based on the characteristics of the mountainous area, they formulated a three-year development plan for agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry for the entire cooperative. According to this plan, mulberry trees and fir trees will be planted on steep mountain slopes, and tea gardens will be cultivated; a piece of fallow land will be designated for grazing cattle and sheep; in the agricultural area, the main focus will be on increasing fertilizer application, building water conservancy projects, and improving farming techniques. It is estimated that by 1957, the total income of the cooperative will increase by 150% compared to 1954, the amount of grain sold to the state will more than double, and a large amount of tea, silkworm cocoons, and meat will also be supplied to the state.

The cooperative members have seen the long-term prospects for development in the mountainous area and are working hard to implement this plan. From the beginning of the year to now, the entire cooperative has accumulated more than 200,000 catties of natural fertilizer, bought 5,000 catties of dried fertilizer, and 1,000 catties of phosphate fertilizer in order to increase grain production. They have also planted more than 1,400 mulberry and fir seedlings, cultivated 21 mu of tea gardens, and bought eight cattle and fifty sheep. Old cooperative member Li Fuyun said, "In the past, we complained that there were too many mountains and we didn't know what to do with them. Now, if we keep working like this, we'll be complaining that there aren't enough mountains!"

    九龙山农业社统一规划生产
    九龙山农业生产合作社在四川筠连县的山区里，全社土地从山顶拉到山脚，坡陡，土薄，农民还有“广种薄收”的习惯，农业收入很少。今年，社员们学习了山西李顺达农业生产合作社“变穷山为富山”的经验，根据山区的特点，制定了全社农、林、畜牧业三年发展计划。按照这个计划，在坡度大的山地栽种桑树，杉树，培植茶园；划出一片轮歇地放牛羊；在农业区，主要是多施肥，修水利，改进耕作技术。预计到一九五七年全社总收入就会比一九五四年增加一倍半，卖给国家的粮食也增加一倍多，还能供给国家大量的茶叶、蚕茧和肉类。
    社员们看到了山区发展的远景，都努力实现这个计划，从年初到现在，全社为了增产粮食，已经积了二十多万斤自然肥料，又买了五千斤枯肥，一千斤磷肥。并已栽了桑树苗和杉树一千四百多株，培植了二十一亩茶园；买了八条牛和五十只羊。老社员李富云说：“以前还说山多了，发愁没有干的，现在照这样干，还嫌山少了呢。”
