    Japan Under Semi-Occupation
      U.S. Interferes in Japan's Internal Affairs by Reducing Disguised Occupation Costs

    U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Allison, handed the U.S. government's response regarding the reduction of Japan's share of the maintenance costs for U.S. troops stationed in Japan to Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu on the 11th. The U.S. response only agreed to reduce 7.2 billion yen, an amount less than half of what Japan requested.

    Right-wing Socialist Party member of parliament Mitsu Kono pointed out that the U.S.'s agreement to reduce was conditional on Japan increasing its rearmament and the costs of U.S. military facilities.

    Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party (Left), Mozaburo Suzuki, stated in Sendai on the 13th, criticizing the U.S. for interfering in the compilation of the Japanese budget. He said: This proves that Japan has lost even the sovereignty to manage its finances, which is something that cannot be ignored.

      U.S. Fabricates Excuses to Prohibit the Import of Many Japanese Goods

    According to Kyodo News, sources close to the Japanese government revealed that the U.S. will use the excuse that raw materials come from "Communist countries" to prohibit the import of 34 kinds of Japanese goods, mainly agricultural products, despite the fact that these goods are officially certified by Japan as not being made from raw materials from "Communist countries." The U.S. has already banned the import of Japanese pig bristle products under the same pretext.

      U.S. Freezes Funds of Japanese Enterprises to Interfere with Trade

    According to the April issue of the "Oriental Economist" magazine, in order to suppress Japanese business circles from developing trade with China, the United States has frozen a considerable amount of dollar funds of Japanese foreign exchange banks and trading companies.

    The magazine said: Even so, there are still some people in the business community who insist on trading with China. They say: "Trade with China is essential for Japan, because it has lost many special procurement demands and is facing great difficulties in promoting exports."

      U.S. Turns Okinawa into a "Tragic Isolated Island"

    Kyodo News special correspondent Yoshino reported from Naha on the situation of Okinawa under the rule of the U.S. authorities, saying: Okinawa is a "tragic isolated island." The past pastoral atmosphere of men farming and women weaving has completely disappeared and has become a large U.S. military base. The U.S. military authorities are endlessly expanding the construction of military bases. The facilities of the U.S. military bases are permanent, which shows that the U.S. military intends to turn Okinawa into the "Gibraltar of the Orient."

    The reporter said: However, the confrontation between the islanders who refuse to requisition land and refuse to move and the U.S. military continues. On the 11th, residents of Ginowan Village gathered to petition the U.S. authorities, requesting a postponement of the construction of the base.

      Japanese Farmers' Tax Burden Increasingly Heavy

    According to the "Akahata" newspaper, the amount of agricultural income tax (national tax) paid by Japanese farmers in 1954 increased sharply from 4.829 billion yen in 1953 to 8.179 billion yen, an increase of 70 percent. The number of taxpayers increased from 669,000 to 748,000.

    In addition to paying heavy national taxes, Japanese farmers also have to pay a wide variety of local taxes, such as residence tax, fixed asset tax, joint facility tax, and irrigation benefit tax. Farmers also suffer from the exploitation of local government agencies at all levels. Last year, in rural areas, in addition to the original town and village resident tax, a new prefecture resident tax was added.

      More Than 20,000 People Committed Suicide in Japan in 1954

    According to materials released by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare, a total of more than 20,000 people committed suicide across Japan in 1954, an average of 55 people per day. This number has not been seen since the 33rd year of the Meiji era in Japan (1900 AD).

    The main reasons for suicide are bankruptcy and poverty.

    在半被占领状态下的日本
      美国利用减少变相占领费干涉日本内政
    美国驻日大使艾利逊在十一日把美国政府关于减少日本对驻日美军维持费负担的答复交给了日本外务相重光葵。美国的答复只同意减少七十二亿日元，这个数目不到日本所要求的一半。
    右派社会党议员河野密指出：美国的同意减少是以日本增加重新武装和美军设施的费用为条件的。
    日本左派社会党主席铃木茂三郎十三日在仙台发表谈话，指责美国干涉日本预算的编制。他说：这证明日本连管理财政的主权也丧失了，这是决不能忽视的事情。
      美国制造藉口将禁止许多日本货进口
    据共同社报道，接近日本政府的人士透露，美国将以原料来自“共产党国家”为藉口，禁止以农产品为主的三十四种日本货输入美国，尽管这些货品都由日本官方证明并不是以“共产党国家”来的原料制成的。美国已经以同样的藉口禁止了日本的猪鬃制品输入美国。
      美国冻结日本企业资金干涉日本贸易
    据四月号的“东方经济学家”杂志透露，美国为了压制日本企业界发展和中国的贸易，已经冻结了不少的日本外汇银行和贸易公司的美元资金。
    这个杂志说：虽然这样，在企业界里还有一些人坚持要和中国进行贸易。他们说：“同中国贸易对于日本来说是切身的必要，因为它已经失去了许多特别采购的需求，而且在促进出口方面又遭到巨大的困难。”
      美国把冲绳岛变成了“悲剧的孤岛”
    共同社特派记者吉野自那霸报道美国当局统治冲绳岛的情况说：冲绳是一个“悲剧的孤岛”。往昔的男耕女织的田园情调已经完全消失，而变成一大美军基地了。美军当局正在漫无止境地扩大建设军事基地。美军基地的设施，都是永久性的，这说明美军已经打算把冲绳变为“东洋的直布罗陀”。
    记者说：但是，在拒绝征用土地坚不迁移的岛民和美军之间，对立依然在继续着。十一日，就有宜野湾村的居民聚集起来，向美国当局请愿，要求暂缓进行建设基地的工程。
      日本农民的捐税负担日益沉重
    据“赤旗报”报道，日本农民在一九五四年缴纳的农业所得税（国税）额，从一九五三年的四十八亿二千九百万日元激增到八十一亿七千九百万日元，即增加了百分之七十。纳税户从六十六万九千户增加到七十四万八千户。
    日本农民除要缴纳苛重的国税外，还要缴纳名目繁多的地方税。如居民税、固定资产税、共同设施税、水利地益税等等。农民还遭受着地方政府机关层层的压榨。去年，在农村里，除原有的市镇村民税外，又新加了府县民税。
      日本一九五四年自杀人数达两万多人
    据日本政府厚生省发表的材料，日本全国在一九五四年自杀的人数共达两万多人，平均每天有五十五人之多。这个数字是日本明治三十三年（公历
  一九○○年）以后所没有过的。
    自杀的原因主要是破产和生活困苦。
