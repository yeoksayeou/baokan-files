    East China Iron and Steel Company Trial-Produces New Products
    In the first quarter of this year, the factories under the East China Iron and Steel Company have achieved significant results in the trial production of new products. Among them, open-hearth Class A steel, No. 8 channel steel, and eight types of industrial steel window profiles have been successfully trial-produced or formally put into production. The technically complex locomotive main frame has also been basically trial-produced. In addition, the company also organized a certain force to trial-smelt converter rimmed steel and trial-roll converter Class A steel outside the plan, both of which were basically successful.
    These successfully trial-produced new products play an important role in industrial construction. For example, Soviet-style steel window profiles are a relatively complex rolled steel product that used to be imported. After China can produce them in complete sets, this economical and beautiful Soviet-style steel window can be used in large quantities in capital construction. The locomotive main frame is the backbone of locomotive manufacturing, and its successful manufacture creates the necessary conditions for China to mass-produce locomotives domestically. The successfully trial-produced Class A steel is also an important steel material to ensure mechanical properties in capital construction. The successful trial production of converter rimmed steel will create favorable conditions for greatly reducing the cost of converter steel ingots and improving the quality of converter steel ingots in the future.
    Currently, the company is actively carrying out the trial production of new products in the second quarter. By mid-April, new products such as ribbed bamboo steel and unequal angle steel have been trial-produced, and the product quality is still good.

    华东钢铁公司试制新产品
    华东钢铁公司所属各厂今年第一季度在新产品试制工作上取得了较显著的成绩。其中平炉甲类钢、八号槽钢和八种工业用钢窗料都已试制成功或正式开始生产。技术条件比较复杂的机车主车架也已基本试成。此外，这个公司还组织了一定力量在计划之外试炼了转炉沸腾钢，试轧了转炉甲类钢，也都基本成功。
    这些试制成功的新产品，对工业建设都有重要作用。如苏联式钢窗料，是一种比较复杂的轧钢产品，过去是用进口货，我国能够成套生产后，在基本建设中就可大量采用这种既经济又美观的苏联式钢窗。机车主车架是制造火车头的骨干，它的制造成功为我国大量自制机车创造了必要条件。试制成功的甲类钢，也是基本建设中保证机械性能的重要钢材。转炉沸腾钢的试制成功，将为今后大量降低转炉钢锭成本，改进转炉钢锭质量创造有利条件。
    现在，这个公司正在积极进行第二季度新产品试制工作，到四月中旬止，又试制了螺纹竹节钢、不等边角钢等新产品，产品质量尚好。
