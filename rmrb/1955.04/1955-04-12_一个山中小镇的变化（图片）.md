Changes in a Small Mountain Town

    The political, economic, and cultural construction of the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hunan Province is constantly developing, and Jishou, the capital of the autonomous prefecture, is also becoming increasingly prosperous.

    The state-owned trading company in Jishou has expanded to four sales departments, supplying a large number of new commodities needed by the Miao people, such as silk fabrics, headscarves, and herbal wine for rheumatism. The newly opened local product purchasing department is specially established according to the characteristics of the Xiangxi area. It is filled with local specialties purchased, such as leopard skins, raccoon skins, deer skins, wild rabbit skins, and duck feathers. Last year, the whole prefecture purchased local products worth 36.5 billion yuan (old currency) at reasonable prices, which played a significant role in improving people's lives and supporting national construction.

    In order to meet the needs of mountain area development and material exchange, the Jishou Bus Station has also been expanded six times its original size, and the river shipping on the Dong River and the horse-drawn carriage industry in Jishou have also been further developed.

    With the prosperity of the economy, the cultural, educational, and health undertakings in Jishou have also developed accordingly. The beds in the newly built First People's Hospital have been expanded from more than 20 to about 100. Xinhua Bookstore has also set up a sales department here.

    In the past two years, Jishou has built new-style houses with a total area of more than 30,000 square meters, including buildings for various organs, schools, hospitals, power plants, bus stations, and cinemas of the autonomous prefecture.

    The working people of the autonomous prefecture have contributed tremendous efforts to the construction of Jishou. The people of Jishou, Fenghuang, and Baojing counties alone supported more than 70,000 fir trees, and also selected the best paint to paint the doors and windows of the newly completed buildings.

    Now, high-voltage power transmission lines are being erected, roads are being built, and underground sewers are being constructed on the main lines of the new urban area of Jishou. This small town in the mountains will gradually be transformed into a new type of city.

    一个山中小镇的变化
    湖南省湘西苗族自治州的政治、经济和文化建设正在不断地发展，自治州的首府——吉首也日益繁荣起来了。
    吉首的国营贸易公司已扩大到四个门市部，供应着为苗族人民所需要的大批绸缎、缠头帕子和风湿药酒等新商品。开业不久的土产收购部是根据湘西地区的特点而专门设立的，这里挂满了收购来的豹皮、狸皮、麂皮、野兔皮和鸭毛等土特产。去年全州以合理价格收购的土特产即达三百六十五亿元（旧币），对改善人民生活和支援国家建设都有很大的作用。
    为了适应山区发展和物资交流的需要，吉首汽车站也比原先扩大了六倍，峒河的船运和吉首的马车业也有了进一步的发展。
    随着经济的繁荣，吉首的文教卫生事业也有了相应的发展。新建的第一人民医院的病床，已由二十多张扩充到一百张左右。新华书店也在这里设立了门市部。
    两年多以来，吉首新建了总面积达三万多平方公尺的新式房屋，包括自治州各机关、学校、医院、电厂、汽车站和电影院等建筑。
    自治州的劳动人民为建设吉首贡献了巨大的力量。仅吉首、凤凰、保靖三县的人民，就支援了七万多根杉木，还选了最好的油漆来给新落成的楼房油饰门窗。
    现在，吉首新市区的干线上正在架设高压输电线、修筑马路和地下水道。这个山中的小镇，就要逐渐变成一座新型的城市了。
