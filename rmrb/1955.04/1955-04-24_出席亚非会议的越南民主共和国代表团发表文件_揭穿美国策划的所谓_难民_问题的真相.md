Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, April 22nd: A document released on April 22nd by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the Asian-African Conference, containing numerous facts, reveals the truth about the "refugee" problem in Vietnam.

The document points out the root of the so-called refugee problem, which originated during the Geneva Conference when the United States orchestrated a plan to move Vietnamese people from the north to the south. The document lists the purposes of this withdrawal plan, as exposed by newspapers around the world: militarily, to recruit soldiers for the South Vietnamese authorities' army; economically, to recruit labor for the southern plantations; politically, to slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, thereby attempting to conceal the secret conspiracy of violating the Geneva Accords from world opinion.

According to the document, coercion and deception were used to instigate this withdrawal. They threatened the people with atomic bombs and spread rumors that the Virgin Mary had left North Vietnam, and that God had ordered priests and believers to go to South Vietnam. Terror and repression were used against those who refused to leave. In Cam Giang (village), Hai Duong province, 392 families were driven out of their villages for disobeying orders. In Cao Lao village, Quang Binh province, 60 residents were shot and 800 houses were burned down for the same reason.

The document recounts the tragic situation of those who withdrew to the south, as described by victims and witnesses.

The document lists many facts to refute the propaganda that there is no religious freedom in North Vietnam. "Many priests – including Antonius Truong Duc Chinh, Quy Lenn D'ias Huy Van Dui, Joseph Nguyen Trong Nghia – wrote in a letter to Catholics on December 5, 1954: 'The government's policy on religion is based on the principle of freedom of belief. The government neither prohibits nor hinders religious ceremonies. Freedom of belief does not only exist now; it has existed since the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and this freedom is also stipulated in our constitution.'

"The abbot of Vinh An Temple in Nghe An province, Master Thich Nguyen Dich, said: 'The government's policy towards all religions is clear. Since the restoration of peace, the People's Government authorities have been helping to restore churches, pagodas, and temples.'"

The document provides evidence to prove the absurdity of the accusation that the Democratic Vietnamese government restricts freedom of movement and prevents people who want to go to the south from leaving. The document states that the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam has sent many mobile teams to various regions of North Vietnam to conduct investigations. These teams have confirmed that the authorities of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam seriously respect freedom of movement and freedom of belief. They have received many letters from priests and Catholics condemning the tricks and actions of the other side's agents who forced people to go to the south.

The document states that in March 1955, a mobile team came to Cen Shan to inspect the situation of nearly 2,000 people leaving for the south. The team was able to prove that the authorities of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam even used ships – the "Belinsky" – to provide travel facilities, and the People's Army troops also helped the "retreating" women board the ships, carrying their children and heavy luggage for them, and distributed food to the poor.

The document concludes: "The creators of the refugee problem are blatantly violating the Geneva Accords. According to the Geneva Accords, everyone in Vietnam has the right to freely choose the region in which he or she wishes to live, and no one has the right to force residents to change their place of residence; everyone has the right to freely choose his or her place of residence."

### 出席亚非会议的越南民主共和国代表团发表文件  揭穿美国策划的所谓“难民”问题的真相

    出席亚非会议的越南民主共和国代表团发表文件
    揭穿美国策划的所谓“难民”问题的真相
    新华社万隆二十二日电　出席亚非会议的越南民主共和国代表团二十二日发表的包括许多事实的文件显示了越南的“难民”问题的真相。
    文件指出了所谓难民问题的根源，这个问题起源于在日内瓦会议期间，那时美国策划了把越南人民从北部撤到南部的计划。文件列举了由世界各国报纸所揭穿的这种撤退计划的目的：在军事上，是为南越当局的军队征集兵士；在经济上，是为南部的种植园征募劳动力；在政治上，是污蔑越南民主共和国，从而试图在世界舆论面前掩饰违反日内瓦协定的秘密阴谋。
    据文件揭露，为了策动这种撤退，使用了强迫和欺骗的方法。他们威胁人民说是要投掷原子弹，并且散布谣言说圣母离开了北越，说上帝命令神甫和信徒们到南越去。对那些不愿离开的人们施用了恐怖和镇压的手段。在海阳省锦江（村）有三百九十二户人家由于不服从命令被从他们的村庄中赶出来。在广平省高劳村有六十名居民由于同样的原因被枪击，八百所房屋被烧毁。
    文件追述了受难者和目睹者所叙述的撤退到南部的人们的悲惨境遇。
    文件列举了许多事实来驳斥对方的这种宣传：北越没有宗教信仰自由。“许多神甫——其中有安东尼斯·张德政、奎伦迪阿斯·辉文对、约瑟夫·阮重义——在一九五四年十二月五日写给天主教徒的一封信中说：‘政府对宗教的政策是以信仰自由的原则为基础的。政府既不禁止也不阻挠举行宗教仪式。信仰自由并不只是现在才存在的，自从越南民主共和国成立以来就有了信仰自由，在我们的宪法里也规定了这种自由。’
    “义安省永安寺方丈戚元滴大师说：‘政府对一切宗教的政策是明确的。自从和平恢复以来，人民政府当局一直在帮助恢复教堂宝塔和庙宇。’”
    文件举出了证据证明下面这种指责的荒谬，这种指责说，民主越南政府限制流动的自由，阻止愿意到南部去的人民离开。文件说，越南的国际监督和监察委员会派出了许多机动小组到北越的各地区去进行调查。这些小组确定越南民主共和国当局认真地尊重流动自由以及信仰自由。它们接到了许多神甫和天主教徒写来的信，谴责对方的特务人员强迫人民到南部去的诡计和行为。
    文件说，一九五五年三月，有一个机动小组来到岑山，视察将近两千人动身去南部的情形。小组能够证明，越南民主共和国当局为了提供旅行便利，甚至使用了船只——“别林斯基号”，而且人民军部队还帮助“撤退”的妇女上船，替她们抱孩子和搬运重的行李，并发给贫苦的人以食物。
    文件最后说：“难民问题的制造者罪恶昭彰地破坏日内瓦协定。根据日内瓦协定，在越南每个人都有权自由选择他所愿意居住的地区，任何人都无权强迫居民变更他的居住地区，每个人都有权自由选定他的居住地方。”
