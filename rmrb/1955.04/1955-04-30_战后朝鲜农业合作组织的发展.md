    The historic land reform carried out in our country after liberation liberated millions of working peasants from the cruel exploitation of landlords and led agriculture from centuries of backwardness and bankruptcy to a new and historically significant path of development. As a result, agricultural production has increased and the living standards of peasants have been significantly improved.
    However, the dispersed small-peasant economy remains in the countryside.
    In order to completely eliminate all sources of exploitation in rural areas, fundamentally improve the living conditions of poor peasants, and develop agriculture to a higher level using modern machinery, it is necessary to gradually implement the socialist transformation of agriculture.
    In the new situation after the victory of the armistice, the Korean people are faced with a historic task. That is: to strive for the reunification and independence of the motherland, and to further strengthen the source of revolution—the northern half of the Republic—politically, economically, and militarily. In order to accomplish this task well, it is necessary to develop not only industry but also agriculture in a planned way. Only by developing industry and agriculture simultaneously and in a balanced way can the completion of this task be guaranteed.
    In our country, due to the implementation of nationalization of important industries, the socialist state-owned economy occupies an absolute advantage and is developing in a planned way. However, in our country's agriculture, the dispersed individual small-commodity economy dominates and is in a backward state. This cannot keep up with the speed of industrial development. Therefore, it is an important task to gradually lead our agriculture towards collectivization, increase socialist components, and implement a planned economy to achieve rapid development in line with the pace of industrial development.
    Especially due to the damage caused by the three-year war, there is a shortage of labor, draft animals, and farm tools in our rural areas.
    In order to solve these problems, it is necessary to collectivize agriculture and rationally utilize labor and draft animals. Only in this way can high agricultural production achievements be guaranteed.
    Therefore, in the post-war period, the basic policy of the Party and the government in rural areas is: to fundamentally solve the economic situation of poor peasants in the shortest possible time, increase socialist components in rural areas, gradually carry out socialist transformation in our country's rural areas, and organize, consolidate, and develop the agricultural production cooperatives spontaneously established by peasants during the war. In this regard, our beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung pointed out: "To thoroughly solve the problem of poor peasants, who account for 30 percent of the total number of peasants in our country, within the next two or three years, and at the same time, to develop agricultural production cooperatives in an organized way, is the main issue of our Party's agricultural policy. These two issues are the decisive key to our Party's agricultural policy."
    The forms of agricultural production cooperative organizations in our country are roughly divided into the following three types:
    The first form:
    This is a rural labor mutual aid group, a small-scale mutual aid form organized by a dozen households to jointly use draft animals, manpower, and farm tools; to jointly carry out basic field farming throughout the year. Each harvests crops on their own land, and there is no distribution problem.
    Draft animals and farm tools are also privately owned, but can be used jointly, and remuneration for their use is calculated.
    Labor is calculated separately; occasional labor is calculated on a seasonal basis and paid in kind. Of course, there can also be public accumulation funds, and sideline businesses can be jointly operated.
    The labor mutual aid group is the lowest and initial form of cooperative organization, a socialist sprout, and has the conditions to develop into a higher form of cooperative organization.
    The second form:
    This is a form of merging land use based on the personal ownership of land and other means of production.
    The means of production belonging to individuals are used jointly, and the cooperative pays a certain usage fee. If the individual is willing, personal farm tools can be sold to the cooperative. The distribution of income is based on labor and land. According to land, that is, distributing a number not exceeding 20 percent of the total produced from the land shares. If a land shareholder fails to achieve 150 labor days of joint labor in the cooperative throughout the year, they will lose the right to distribute land income.
    The cooperative's public accumulation fund is 5 to 10 percent of the total income, of which cultural and recreational expenses account for 2 to 3 percent. Since the land is still privately owned, if one wants to withdraw from the cooperative, one can return the original land shares.
    This form of cooperative organization will gradually enter a more advanced form—the third form.
    The third form:
    This is the highest form of agricultural production cooperative in our country. Land, draft animals, and farm tools are all owned by the cooperative.
    The cooperative assesses the price of draft animals and farm tools and compensates the original owners. Distribution is based on the quality and quantity of labor. In addition, there are small plots of land for personal use. Each household can also keep a certain number of livestock and poultry. The cooperative's public accumulation fund accounts for 10 to 15 percent of the total income, of which cultural and recreational expenses account for 2 to 3 percent.
    The third form of agricultural production cooperative organization is currently being vigorously organized in our country.
    The above-mentioned forms are all needed for the socialist transformation of agriculture in our country and have important political and economic significance.
    In order to strengthen the leadership of the Party and the government over agricultural cooperatives, the registration of agricultural cooperatives has been carried out to stabilize the economic foundation of agricultural cooperatives and fully guarantee their economic development. To this end, it has been decided to give them priority in raising funds, fertilizers, and farm tools, guaranteeing the exchange of fine seeds and fine breeds of livestock, and organizing agricultural machinery tillage stations and horse-drawn tillage stations to strengthen assistance in agricultural science and veterinary science.
    In order to solve the problems of poor peasants, the Party and the government have paid special attention to the widespread organization and development of agricultural-pastoral (semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral), agricultural-fishing (semi-agricultural and semi-fishing) and other production cooperatives.
    Most of the poor peasants in our country live in the barren mountain valleys and coastal areas. If these poor peasants cannot actively utilize the abundant resources in the mountains and the sea, and rely solely on the limited grain from a small piece of land to sustain themselves, it will be impossible to rapidly change their situation.
    For this reason, the Party and the government have taken special measures to consolidate and develop agricultural-pastoral production cooperatives in mountain valleys and agricultural-fishing production cooperatives in coastal areas, solving the problem of fine breeds of livestock for agricultural-pastoral production cooperatives, and lending and raising fishing boats and fishing nets for agricultural-fishing production cooperatives.
    Thanks to the correct leadership and help of the Party, the government, and Marshal Kim Il-sung, and thanks to the creative struggles of the cooperative members, the unit area yield of agricultural production cooperative members in crops in 1954 increased by an average of 10 to 60 percent compared with individual farming; due to the development of animal husbandry, fisheries, and other various sideline businesses, the cooperative members earned 20 to 50 percent more income in crops than individual farming, and 2 to 5 times more cash income. In areas restricted by barren land, the problem of insufficient food has also been fully solved.
    Agricultural production cooperatives in our country have significantly improved productivity despite the shortage of labor and draft animals. Generally speaking, they can save 20 to 30 percent of labor from agricultural production and transfer it to other departments.
    Agricultural production cooperatives in our country have not only achieved great economic achievements, but also great political achievements. Through collective production, all members gradually developed a sense of honor in common labor and a high sense of responsibility. They are growing into new-type peasants with collectivist thinking, organization, and discipline, and are growing into excellent peasants who are dedicated to fighting for the motherland and the people, and who understand serving the interests of the country and society.
    The achievements made by the agricultural production cooperatives organized for the first time in the history of our country are favorable conditions for the socialist transformation of agriculture in our country. Facts have proved that only this superior form can enable the planning of agricultural production in our country, can thoroughly implement crop production according to the principle of adapting to local conditions, can widely use agricultural machinery and new agricultural technologies, improve farming methods, and continuously improve agricultural production in our country. Not only that, but it can also supply more raw materials to our country's industry, enable peasants to get rid of poverty forever, and embark on a new and happier road.
    Precisely because of this, the peasants widely support taking the road of collectivization, and the ranks of collectivization are growing rapidly. As of January 1, 1955, our country already had 10,098 agricultural production cooperatives (second and third forms), accounting for 32 percent of the total number of peasant households in the northern half of the Republic, with a cultivated area of 29 percent. This means that the socialist cooperative form already accounts for one-third of all agriculture.
    Agricultural cooperative organizations in our country have not only grown in number, but also developed rapidly in terms of the size and form of the cooperatives.
    In the early stage of establishing agricultural cooperative organizations in our country, that is, in July 1953, each cooperative had an average of only 12.6 households. By January 1954, it had grown to 16.1 households; by June of the same year, it had grown to 19.8 households; and by December of the same year, it had grown to 32.7 households.
    In March 1954, the third form of agricultural production cooperatives in our country accounted for 36.6 percent of all cooperatives; by the end of the same year, it had increased to 78.5 percent. In contrast, the second form of agricultural production cooperatives decreased from 39.4 percent to 21.5 percent.
    This means that a qualitative change has taken place within the agricultural cooperatives in our country, that is to say, the socialist component has increased and is developing towards a higher form.
    Although the agricultural cooperative organization work in our country has achieved great achievements in the past period, there are also many shortcomings.
    Some areas have violated the principle of voluntariness in the process of developing agricultural production cooperatives; some have not paid enough attention to agricultural cooperatives, allowing them to develop freely and ignoring the policies of the Party and the government.
    In terms of the management and operation of agricultural cooperatives, some have violated regulations, disregarded the principles of democratic management, especially violated the socialist principles of labor organization and distribution, and there have been many phenomena of reducing labor productivity. The movement to increase production carried out by some cooperatives has not been carried out well, the protection and management of public property is not thorough, and there are phenomena of embezzlement and waste, thus reducing the income of the members.
    Today, we are faced with an important task, that is, to quickly and thoroughly overcome the shortcomings that have arisen in the past period, to lead and help the widely organized agricultural production cooperatives by all means, and to consolidate and develop them organizationally and economically.
    The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea held in November 1954 pointed out the specific methods of consolidating and developing the agricultural production cooperatives that have been organized from an organizational and economic point of view.
    The November Plenary Session emphasized that the Party and state organs should improve and strengthen the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives, strengthen the state's assistance to agricultural production cooperatives, improve the management and operation of cooperatives, widely study and absorb the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, and strengthen the leading role of Party organizations in cooperatives.
    In terms of consolidating and developing agricultural production cooperatives organizationally and economically, the main and basic task is to correctly organize and implement economic management in agricultural production cooperatives, and continuously increase output and income. In this regard, we are taking various measures and paying great attention to expanding agricultural machinery tillage stations.
    Also, while establishing the socialist principles of labor organization and distribution in cooperatives, we are strengthening the struggle against egalitarian tendencies; in addition, we are further increasing political vigilance against all enemies who attempt to sabotage the agricultural collectivization movement in our country.
    We pay special attention to the thorough protection, management, and continuous increase of cooperative public property, and in consolidating and developing cooperatives, we strive to concentrate our efforts on strengthening the most important political work, strengthening class education in cooperatives, strengthening the education of Marxism-Leninism, and strengthening the education of various socialist management knowledge.
    Under the correct leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea, the government of the Republic, and Marshal Kim Il-sung, and with the active efforts of all peasants, agricultural production cooperatives in our country will achieve great achievements and continue to develop.

    战后朝鲜农业合作组织的发展
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国农业省副相　朴景洙
    我国解放以后进行的历史性的土地改革，使得几百万劳动农民从地主残酷的剥削下解放出来，把农业从几世纪以来的落后的、破产的状态中引上了新的、具有历史意义的发展的道路。因此，农业生产提高了，农民的生活水平也显著地得到改善和提高。
    但是，在农村中仍然保持着分散的小农经济。
    为了彻底清除农村中的一切剥削根源，从根本上改善贫农的生活状况，使农业的发展达到使用现代化机器的更高的水平，就必须逐步地对农业实行社会主义改造。
    在胜利停战后新的形势下，朝鲜人民面前摆着一项历史性的任务。这就是：争取祖国的统一和独立，进一步从政治、经济和军事方面加强革命的源泉地——共和国北半部。为了很好地完成这项任务，不仅要使工业，而且还要使农业得到有计划的发展。只有使工业和农业同时地、平衡地发展，才能保证这项任务的完成。
    我国的工业，由于实行了重要产业国有化，社会主义的国营经济占绝对优势，并正在有计划地发展着。但是，在我国的农业中，却是分散的个体小商品经济占着优势，并处于落后状态。这是不能赶上工业的发展速度的。因此，把我国的农业逐步地引向集体化，增加社会主义成分，并进行计划经济，使它得到急遽的发展，同工业发展的步调一致起来，是一项重要的任务。
    尤其是由于三年战争所受的破坏，我国农村中的劳动力、耕畜和农具是不足的。
    为了解决这些问题，只有使农业合作化，合理地利用劳动力和耕畜。也只有这样，才能保证农业的高度的生产成就。
    因此，战后时期，党和政府在农村中的基本政策是：在最短期间内，从根本上解决贫农的经济状况，增加农村中的社会主义成分，逐步地在我国农村进行社会主义改造，并有组织地巩固、发展农民在战争时期自发建立的农业生产合作社。对此，我们敬爱的领袖金日成元帅曾指出：“要在最近两三年内彻底解决占我国农民总数百分之三十的贫农问题，同时，有组织地发展农业生产合作社，是我党农业政策的主要问题。这两个问题就是我党农业政策的决定性的关键。”
    我国农业生产合作组织的形式，大致分为如下三种：
    第一种形式：
    这是一种农村劳动互助组，是一种由十几户组织起来的小规模的互助形式，共同使用耕畜、人力和农具；在一年内共同进行田间的基本耕作。各自收获自己土地上的农作物，并不产生分配问题。
    耕畜和农具也属个人所有，但可共同使用，并计算其使用报酬。
    劳动力另外计算，不经常的劳动力按季计算，付给实物。当然，也可以有公积金，并可以共同经营副业。
    劳动互助组是最低级的、初步的合作组织形式，是社会主义的萌芽，具有向更高级形式的合作组织发展的条件。
    第二种形式：
    这是在土地及其他生产工具归个人所有的基础上，合并使用土地的形式。
    共同使用属于个人的生产工具，由合作社支付一定的使用费。如本人愿意，个人的农具可以售归合作社所有。收入的分配根据劳动力和土地进行。根据土地，就是从入股土地所生产出的总数中分配百分之二十以内的数目。土地入股者在一年当中如果没能达到合作社共同劳动的一百五十个劳动日时，就要丧失分配土地所得的权利。
    合作社的公积金是总收入的百分之五至十，其中文娱费占百分之二至三。由于土地仍然为私人所有，如要退社，可以退还原先入股的土地。
    这种形式的合作组织，将逐渐地进入更高级的形式——第三种形式。
    第三种形式：
    这是我国最高级的农业生产合作社形式。土地、耕畜和农具全部归合作社所有。
    耕畜和农具由合作社评出价格偿付原主。分配是根据劳动的质和量进行。此外，还有个人使用的小块田地。每户并可保有家畜和家禽若干。合作社的公积金占总收入的百分之十至十五，其中文娱费占百分之二至三。
    第三种形式的农业生产合作社组织，目前我国正在大力组织。
    上述各种形式，都是我国进行农业社会主义改造所需要的，并具有重要的政治和经济意义。
    党和政府为了加强对农业合作社的领导，进行了农业合作社的登记，以稳固农业合作社的经济基础，圆满地保证其经济发展。为此，决定优先地为他们筹措资金、肥料和农具，向他们保证优良种籽、优良种畜的交换，并组织农业机器代耕站和马匹代耕站，加强农业科学和兽医科学等方面的帮助。
    党和政府为了解决贫苦农民的问题，特别注意到广泛地组织和发展农牧（半农半牧）、农渔（半农半渔）等生产合作社。
    我国贫苦农民大都生活在土地贫瘠的山谷地带和海岸地带。如果这些贫苦农民不能积极利用山上和海中的丰富资源，只靠有限的一点土地的谷物来维持，是不可能迅速改变他们的状况的。
    为此，党和政府对于山谷地带的农牧生产合作社和海岸地带的农渔生产合作社，特别采取了巩固和发展的措施，为农牧生产合作社解决优良种畜，为农渔生产合作社借贷、筹措渔船和渔网。
    由于党、政府和金日成元帅的正确领导和帮助，由于合作社社员们的创造性的斗争，一九五四年农业生产合作社社员在农作物方面的单位面积产量，比单干时平均提高了百分之十到六十；由于牧畜业、渔业及其他各种副业得到了发展，社员在农作物方面比单干时多收入了百分之二十至五十，现款则多收入了二倍至五倍。在受土地贫瘠所限制的地方，也充分地解决了食粮不足的问题。
    我国的农业生产合作社在劳动力和耕畜不足的条件下，仍然显著地提高了生产率。一般来说，并能从农业生产中节约出百分之二十至三十的劳动力转入其它部门。
    我国的农业生产合作社不仅在经济方面取得了很大的成就，而且在政治方面也取得了很大的成就。所有社员们通过集体生产，逐渐产生了共同劳动的荣誉感和高度的责任感，他们正在成长为具有集体主义思想的、有组织、有纪律的新型农民，并正在成长为为祖国和人民而献身斗争的、懂得为国家利益和社会利益服务的优秀农民。
    我国历史上第一次组织起来的农业生产合作社所取得的这种成绩，是我国进行农业社会主义改造的有利条件。事实证明，只有这种优越的形式，才能使我国的农业生产计划化，才能彻底实行根据因地制宜原则的农作物生产，才能广泛地使用农业机器和新农业技术、改进耕种方法，并使我国的农业生产不断地得到提高。不仅如此，还可以为我国工业供给更多的原料，使农民永远摆脱贫困，走上新的更幸福的道路。
    正因为这样，农民们广泛地拥护走合作化道路，日益飞速地壮大着合作化的队伍。到一九五五年一月一日为止，我国已经有一万零九十八个农业生产合作社（第二、第三种形式的），为共和国北半部农户总数的百分之三十二，耕地面积为百分之二十九。这就意味着社会主义的合作形式已占全部农业的三分之一了。
    我国的农业合作组织不但在数字方面有所成长，而且在合作社的规模和形式方面也有着急速的发展。
    我国在建立农业合作组织的初期，即一九五三年七月，每个合作社平均只有十二点六户。到一九五四年一月，成长为十六点一户；到同年六月，成长为十九点八户；到同年十二月，成长为三十二点七户。
    一九五四年三月，我国第三种形式的农业生产合作社占全部合作社的百分之三十六点六；到同年年底，就增加到百分之七十八点五。与此相反，第二种形式的农业生产合作社从百分之三十九点四降为百分之二十一点五。
    这意味着我国的农业合作社内部发生了质的变化，也就是说，社会主义成分增多了，并正向更高级的形式发展。
    我国的农业合作组织工作在过去一段时间内虽然取得了巨大的成就，但是也存在着不少缺点。
    有些地区在发展农业生产合作社过程中，违反了自愿原则；有的对农业合作社的关心不够，任其自流，忽视了党和政府的政策。
    在农业合作社的管理和经营方面，有的违反了规章，无视民主管理原则，特别是违反劳动的组织和分配的社会主义原则，并有不少降低劳动生产率的现象。有些合作社所进行的提高产量的运动，没能很好地开展起来，对公有财产保护、管理得不彻底，并有盗用和浪费的现象，因之减少了社员的收入。
    今天，我们面前摆着一项重要的任务，这就是：尽速地彻底克服在过去一段时间内产生的缺点，用一切办法领导和帮助已经广泛组织起来的农业生产合作社，并在组织上和经济上把它们巩固和发展起来。
    一九五四年十一月召开的朝鲜劳动党中央委员会全体会议指出了从组织上和经济上巩固、发展已经组织起来的农业生产合作社的具体办法。
    十一月全会强调：党和国家机关要改进并加强对农业生产合作社的领导，并加强国家对农业生产合作社的帮助，改善合作社的管理和经营，广泛地研究、吸取苏联及各人民民主国家的先进经验，加强党组织在合作社中的领导作用。
    从组织上和经济上巩固、发展农业生产合作社方面，主要的、基本的任务是在农业生产合作社中正确地组织并实行经济管理，不断地提高产量和收入。在这方面，我们正采取各种措施，并给予扩大农业机器代耕站以很大的注意。
    还有，我们在建立合作社劳动的组织和分配的社会主义原则的同时，正加强着反对平均主义倾向的斗争；此外，并进一步提高对企图破坏我国农业合作化运动的一切敌人的政治警觉性。
    我们特别关心合作社公有财产的彻底保护、管理及其不断的增加，并在巩固、发展合作社方面，努力集中力量加强着最重要的政治工作，加强合作社内的阶级教育，加强马克思列宁主义的教育，并加强各种社会主义的经营知识的教育。
    我国的农业生产合作组织在朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和金日成元帅的正确领导下，在全体农民的积极努力下，将会取得巨大的成就，并不断地得到发展。
