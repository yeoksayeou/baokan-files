The Emei Phosphate Mine
Wang Yuchang

At the stroke of midnight, amidst the peaks of Mount Emei, countless shimmering lights rise slowly from the valleys, drifting like distant sails on a sea of mist, now bright, now dim. These are the unique foxfires of Mount Emei, which in the past were said to be the "bright lamps" lit by Samantabhadra, the presiding deity of Mount Emei. The people who live here regard this as a "blessed land," saying that these "lamps" are divine lamps. Whoever is sincere and lights a lamp that will burn for ten thousand years, the lamp will fly into the mist to worship the Bodhisattva, and happiness will follow to their home. However, before liberation, the land on Mount Emei never grew lush crops, and the reactionary rulers' exorbitant taxes continued to increase. The farmers in the Emei mountain area never had a good day.

Happiness only truly arrived after liberation!

In April 1951, just as the land reform was beginning, a phosphate mine investigation team sent by the People's Government came to Mount Emei. Old engineers and young geological surveyors were active in the ravines overgrown with kudzu vines. Then came the trenching workers and the tunneling workers. They discovered phosphate-bearing striped ore, "mud ore," and carbonate ore with higher phosphate content. More and more people were sent by the People's Government to search for phosphate mines.

In the spring of 1953, just as Mount Emei was adorned with new greenery, the first phosphate fertilizer plant in Sichuan was built at the foot of the mountain and began producing phosphate fertilizer powder! In the past, this was a hillside overgrown with weeds, with a few dilapidated alcohol factory buildings and a few farmhouses, and a clear, crystal-clear river quietly flowing past the foot of the slope. The constructed phosphate fertilizer plant rapidly changed the face of the Emei mountain area: tunnel openings resembling small city gates appeared on the mountainside, with the clang of cannons, hammers, and rocks impacting each other day and night, and the rumbling of blasting rocks. Workers blasted rocks to extract phosphate ore. Nearby farmers used their spare time to help the workers transport the ore in groups. The crushing workshop of the phosphate mine was built next to the river. An iron gate blocked the flow of water, and the water flowed through a pipe into the guide vanes of the water turbine in the crushing workshop, turning into the motive power of the crushing workshop. Thus, the ball mill, blower, and stone crusher started to rotate, turning the transported phosphate ore into fine fertilizer phosphate powder.

The phosphate fertilizer produced here was transported and sold to rural areas in Emei, Jiajiang, Leshan, Pengshan, Meishan, and other counties for trial use. Except for some areas where the use was improper or the soil was unsuitable, yields generally increased. Li Yingfeng, a farmer in Baima Township near the mining area, used phosphate fertilizer in his rapeseed field and increased his harvest by 60% compared to using oilseed cake in the past. Chen Kairong, a farmer in Gaoqiao Township, Emei County, who had eaten "Guanyin clay" and "wild pearls" due to famine, applied phosphate fertilizer, and the grains were full and heavy, increasing the yield by a total of two dan (approximately 200 kg) of grain. They said: The Communist Party has come, and we don't light divine lamps but still increase production. What divine lamps! The worker brothers have told us that the "lights" worshiping Samantabhadra are the light of phosphate mines!

With the development of the rural cooperative movement, the demand for phosphate fertilizer is also increasing day by day. Last year, the production of phosphate powder by the Leshan Phosphate Fertilizer Plant increased by nearly one and a half times compared to 1953, but it still far from meets the needs of the countryside. Therefore, a new longitudinal tunnel exploration project has begun on the western wing of the Emei Phosphate Mine. Now, the main tunnel and the ventilation tunnel have been excavated for more than one hundred and several tens of meters. The technicians and workers who are going to learn how to use rock drills will return in April this year and use rock drills to open mountains. At that time, the daily team shift excavation efficiency will increase by about three times compared to manual excavation. To prepare for the use of rock drills, a wide motor road has already started construction, and huge portable steam engines, drill sharpening machines, and air compressors will soon be transported up the mountain from here. When this exploration project is completed, a new phosphate fertilizer plant with an annual output of tens of thousands of tons of phosphate fertilizer will begin to be designed and built.

To find more phosphate resources, the Southwest Geological Bureau has sent a large geological team this year. Now, its vanguard has arrived at the top of the mountain, and workers' sheds, dormitories, and warehouses have begun to be built. A geological team is already working on the snowy mountaintop.

The Leshan Phosphate Fertilizer Plant is also starting to expand. Workers and farmers are building a dam to raise the water level and supply water to the phosphate fertilizer plant and farmland. The crushing workshop of the Leshan Phosphate Fertilizer Plant will also add a set of crushing and grinding equipment this year, so that the ore from coarse crushing to packaging will be fully mechanized. These devices will be put into production in September this year. When these machines start production, the annual output of the Leshan Phosphate Fertilizer Plant can be increased by four times compared to last year.

    峨眉磷矿
    王焴长
    一到午夜时分，峨嵋山的群峰间，就有千百万点晶莹闪灼的光亮，从山沟里徐徐升起，然后，像雾海远帆一样，游来荡去，时明时灭。这是峨嵋山上特有的磷火，但在过去，却传说是朝拜峨嵋山主神——普贤菩萨点的“明灯”。在这儿居住的人把这里看成是一块“福地”，说这些“灯”是神灯，谁要诚心，点上一盏万年长青灯，灯飞到那片雾里去朝拜菩萨，幸福就随着到他的家。但是，峨嵋山一片片的山地，解放前从没有长出过茂盛的庄稼，反动统治者的苛捐杂税，倒不断地在增加。峨嵋山区的农民没有过过一天好日子。
    幸福，只是在解放以后才真正地来到了！
    一九五一年四月，正当土地改革开始的时候，人民政府派出的磷矿考查团，来到了峨嵋山。年老的工程师，年轻的地质勘查人员，在葛藤蔓生的山沟里活动开了。接着，槽探工人、打洞工人来了。他们发现了含磷的条纹矿、“泥巴矿”，发现了含磷品位更高的碳酸矿。人民政府派来找寻磷矿的人，越来越多。
    一九五三年春天，峨嵋山刚刚换上新装，四川第一个磷肥厂就在山麓下建设起来，开始生产磷肥粉了！过去，这儿是一个野草横生的山坡，坡上有几间酒精厂的破房子和几户农家，另有一弯清澈见底的河水，悄悄流过坡脚。修建起来的磷肥厂，迅速地改变了峨嵋山区的面貌：山腰上出现了一个个像小城门的山洞，洞里日夜不停地响着炮焊、铁锤与岩石冲击的铿锵声，响着炸裂山岩的??爆破声。工人们炸掉岩石，开出磷矿。附近的农民就用自己的空闲时间，成群结队地帮助工人们把矿石运走。磷矿厂的粉碎车间建筑在河的旁边。一道铁闸门把流水拦腰截住，水通过一根管子，流进粉碎车间水机力的导叶轮，变成了粉碎车间的原动力。于是，球磨机、鼓风机和碎石机转动起来了，把运来的磷矿石，制成了细细的肥田磷矿粉。
    这里生产的磷肥运销到峨眉、夹江、乐山、彭山、眉山等县农村试用。除部分地区因使用不得法，或土质不宜外，一般都增了产。矿区附近白马乡农民李英俸，在油菜地里用了磷肥，比过去用油麱收成，增加了六成。曾经因灾荒吃过“观音土”、“野珠子”的峨眉县高桥乡农民陈开荣施用了磷肥，谷粒结的饱满沉重，总共增产两担谷子。他们说：共产党来了，我们不点神灯倒增了产。啥子神灯啊！工人老大哥都给我们讲了，朝普贤的“灯”就是磷矿的光！
    随着农村合作化运动的开展，磷肥需要量也在逐日增加。去年，乐山磷肥厂生产的磷矿粉，就比一九五三年增加将近一倍半，但是还远不能满足农村的需要。所以又在峨眉磷矿的西翼，开始了新的沿脉洞探工程。现在，这儿的正洞和风洞，都已掘进了一百几十公尺。去学习使用凿岩机的技术员和工人，今年四月就要回来，用凿岩机开山。那时，每天台班掘进效率，将比手工掘进增加三倍左右。为了给使用凿岩机作好准备，一条宽敞的汽车道已经开工，巨大的锅驼机、锻钎机、空气压缩机即将从这里运送上山。当这项探洞工程结束，一个年产数万吨磷肥的新的磷肥厂就要开始设计、兴建。
    为了找寻更多的磷矿资源，西南地质局今年派来了一个庞大的地质队。现在，它的先头部队已经来到山头，工棚、宿舍及库房已经开始修建。一个地质小组已在白雪皑皑的山头进行工作。
    现在的乐山磷肥厂也开始扩建了。工人和农民们正在修筑一道拦河坝，以提高水位，供给磷肥厂和农田的用水。乐山磷肥厂的粉碎车间，今年还要增添一套碎磨设备，使矿石从粗碎直到包装，全部做到机械化。这些设备，在今年九月就可投入生产。当这些机器开始生产后，乐山磷肥厂的年产量就可以比去年提高四倍。
