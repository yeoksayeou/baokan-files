The Asian-African Conference, representing twenty-nine countries and 1.44 billion people of Asia and Africa, is about to open in Bandung, Indonesia. The broad masses of people in Asia and Africa, and all peace-loving people around the world, are showing increasing concern and support for the convening of the Asian-African Conference. The U.S. aggressive bloc's conspiracy to undermine the Asian-African Conference is also becoming increasingly blatant. The incident in which the plane carrying staff members of our delegation to the Asian-African Conference exploded and crashed into the sea due to the premeditation of U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek agents is precisely a part of the entire conspiracy of the U.S. aggressive bloc to deliberately undermine the Asian-African Conference.

From the time Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo proposed convening the Asian-African Conference, the U.S. aggressive bloc has been putting pressure on certain member states of the Colombo Conference, attempting to strangle the Asian-African Conference in the preparatory process. On August 8 last year, Aruji, the Second Deputy Speaker of the Indonesian Parliament, angrily denounced the United States for "using dishonest methods to create divisions among the Colombo countries and obstruct the convening of the Asian-African Conference." In late December last year, the Prime Ministers of the five South Asian countries decided to convene the Asian-African Conference at the Bogor Conference. According to the American "Business Week," this decision made Washington "panic." Because they were worried that the United States would become "the accused" (Lipmann's words). Therefore, U.S. officials and bourgeois newspapers have been doing their utmost to denigrate the purpose of the Asian-African Conference and obstruct certain Asian and African countries from participating in the conference. An article by the Washington correspondent of the U.S. "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" frankly admitted:
	"The United States hopes that the Asian-African Conference will not be held at all."

It is not difficult to understand why the U.S. ruling bloc is so afraid of the Asian-African Conference and painstakingly trying to obstruct and undermine it. The purpose revealed by the Asian-African Conference is to promote peace in the Asian-African region and promote friendly cooperation between Asian and African countries. This is detrimental to the war and aggression policies pursued by U.S. imperialism in Asia and Africa. In order to enslave the people of Asia and Africa and accelerate the preparation for a new war with the People's Republic of China as the main target, the followers of the U.S. "policy of strength" are creating divisions and antagonism among Asian and African countries, attempting to turn many Asian and African countries into its military bases and tools of aggression. Under such circumstances, is it any wonder that the U.S. aggressive bloc "panics" and becomes annoyed and uneasy about the convening of the Asian-African Conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China?

Since the U.S. aggressive bloc cannot prevent the convening of the Asian-African Conference, it will try to undermine the Asian-African Conference in many ways so that the conference cannot proceed smoothly and cannot achieve positive results. Therefore, the U.S. aggressive bloc has adopted more hypocritical and more vicious methods to launch a conspiracy to undermine the Asian-African Conference. However, according to the Associated Press, Washington officials described this conspiracy as an attitude of "benevolent neutrality" towards the Asian-African Conference. The resolution of "congratulations" to the Asian-African Conference passed by the Manila Treaty member states at the Bangkok Conference was probably the beginning of adopting this "benevolent neutrality" attitude. Since then, U.S. officials and propaganda machines have changed their tune and no longer openly promoted that the Asian-African Conference "is an action against the West." People know that this is not because the U.S. aggressive bloc has changed its view of the Asian-African Conference, nor is it because the Asian-African Conference has changed its nature, but because the U.S. aggressive bloc itself feels that such disguise is more conducive to carrying out the conspiracy to undermine the Asian-African Conference.

First of all, they changed a set of deceptive and enticing tricks, such as forcibly linking the Five Principles with the Manila Treaty and the "Pacific Charter," expressing "support for the independence and self-determination of all peoples" (Eisenhower's words), and "hoping" that the Asian-African Conference "can promote the idea of national independence" (Dulles's words). They also released air that they would help "friendly Asian countries" to put "atomic energy to peaceful uses," and on the eve of the Asian-African Conference, Eisenhower proposed the so-called "economic aid plan" to the "Asian arc zone," propagandizing that they would "assist Asian countries in industrialization" and "improve the living standards of the Asian people." All of these are just using various disguises to cover up their ugly faces, confuse the public opinion of Asian and African countries and peoples, and shift the goals of the Asian-African Conference. The real purpose it pursues is exactly the opposite of what it says.

In order to undermine the Asian-African Conference, U.S. officials and propaganda machines are carrying out extremely shameless instigation and slander and rumors among the countries participating in the Asian-African Conference. They are instigating relations between Arab countries, instigating relations between Colombo countries, and so on. They are unreservedly coercing certain countries to "resist the pressure of neutralism" at the Asian-African Conference. U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Malik publicly stated on March 20 that "the Americans will try to ally with as many Arab countries as possible to fight against communist influence at the Asian-African Conference." Their actions are so blatant that even Philippine officials are "annoyed at being seen as 'America's voice' in Bandung" (Associated Press, Manila, 8th).

U.S. officials and propaganda machines spare no effort to instigate relations between China and other countries, especially between China and India. They have repeatedly fabricated rumors that China wants to "seize leadership of the Asian-African world," and that "the behind-the-scenes struggle in Bandung will mainly be a competition between the Republic of India and Communist China." Even when the people of China and India were extremely indignant at the premeditated mishap of the Chinese delegation's plane by U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek agents, they did not forget to use this incident as material to instigate Sino-Indian relations.

The U.S. aggressive bloc is very afraid that Asian and African countries will increase their understanding and friendship with the People's Republic of China through extensive contacts at the Asian-African Conference. According to the British "Sunday Times," the U.S. State Department's fear has reached the point of "hair-raising." "What makes the United States hair-raising is the idea that the Chinese Communists will have direct contact in Bandung with politicians from those countries that the United States particularly hopes will not be infected by China." Therefore, U.S. officials and propaganda machines not only process and manufacture the myth of "communist threat," but also carry out malicious slanders on China's minority nationalities issues, overseas Chinese issues, border issues, and other issues, in order to instigate relations between China and many countries.

It can be seen from this that the so-called "benevolent neutrality" attitude of the U.S. imperialists is originally intended to create an atmosphere of mutual suspicion and distrust in the Asian-African Conference, as the Washington news of the U.S. International News Agency implies, so that the conference will have "hundreds of small problems" and "split and disintegrate." Isn't this clear enough?

It is a well-known fact that the U.S. aggressive bloc instructs Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs to carry out various subversive and destructive activities in many areas of Southeast Asia. Recently, U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek agents have been making every effort to undermine the smooth progress of the Asian-African Conference. According to "Indonesian News," the Chiang Kai-shek bandit terrorist organization "Iron Blood Corps," which has close ties with the U.S. intelligence agencies, is contacting Indonesian armed bandits in order to carry out harassment and assassination activities during the Asian-African Conference. "Many Kuomintang members in Japan and the Philippines will disguise themselves as representatives and journalists attending the Asian-African Conference." According to Jakarta newspapers, Taiwan and Chiang Kai-shek bandits hiding in Hong Kong are constantly sneaking into Indonesia with the help of U.S. intelligence agencies in Hong Kong. At the same time, a large number of suspicious U.S. "travelers" are also flocking to Jakarta and Bandung. An Associated Press report from Jakarta on March 30 said that "the most problematic security concern at the Asian-African Conference is of course Zhou Enlai...". The U.S. news agency openly encourages the terrorist activities of Chiang Kai-shek bandit agents directly under U.S. command, and openly incites Chiang Kai-shek bandit agents to assassinate members of the Chinese delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai. This is certainly not accidental.

It can be seen from this that U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang regard special agent terrorist activities as an important aspect of the entire conspiracy plan to undermine the Asian-African Conference. The so-called "benevolent neutrality" attitude of the United States is originally doing inhuman murder under the guise of "congratulating" the Asian-African Conference. They attempt to create an atmosphere of unease and intensify the tense situation through special agent assassination activities, so that the Asian-African Conference cannot proceed smoothly.

However, no matter how hard the U.S. aggressive bloc tries to undermine the Asian-African Conference, its conspiracy will never succeed. The people of Asia and Africa must strive for the smooth progress of the Asian-African Conference, and must make the Asian-African Conference make beneficial contributions to maintaining peace in the Asian-African region and promoting friendly cooperation among Asian and African countries.

    美国怎样破坏亚非会议
    邵宗汉
    代表着亚洲和非洲的二十九个国家和十四亿四千万人民的亚非会议，就要在印度尼西亚的万隆开幕了。亚非广大人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民对亚非会议的召开，越来越表示关心和支持。美国侵略集团破坏亚非会议的阴谋活动，也越来越露骨了。我国出席亚非会议代表团工作人员座机因美蒋特务的预谋而爆炸坠海的事件，就正是美国侵略集团蓄意破坏亚非会议的整个阴谋活动中的一部分。
    从印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约建议召开亚非会议的时候起，美国侵略集团就向科伦坡会议的某些成员国施加压力，企图在准备过程中就扼杀亚非会议。去年八月八日，印度尼西亚国会第二副议长阿鲁齐曾愤慨地斥责美国“利用不光明正大的方式，企图在科伦坡国家间制造分裂，并阻挠召开亚非会议”。去年十二月下旬，南亚五国总理在茂物会议上决定召开亚非会议。据美国的“商业周刊”说，这个决定使华盛顿“感到慌张”。因为他们耽心美国将成为“被审者”（李普曼语）。因此美国官方和资产阶级报刊极力诋毁亚非会议的目的，并阻挠某些亚非国家参加会议。美国“圣路易邮报”发表的驻华盛顿记者的一篇文章，坦白供认：
  “美国希望根本就不召开亚非会议”。
    美国统治集团这样害怕亚非会议而处心积虑地加以阻挠和破坏，是不难理解的。亚非会议所揭示的目的是要促进亚非地区的和平，促进亚非国家之间的友好合作。这是不利于美帝国主义在亚洲和非洲所推行的战争政策和侵略政策的。美国“实力政策”的奉行者为了奴役亚非人民，并加速准备以中华人民共和国为主要敌对目标的新战争，正在亚非国家间制造着分裂和对立，企图把许多亚非国家变成它的军事基地和侵略政策的工具。在这种情形下，美国侵略集团对召开有中华人民共和国参加的亚非会议，“感到慌张”恼怒不安，又有什么奇怪呢？
    美国侵略集团既然不能阻止亚非会议的召开，就要从多方面来破坏亚非会议，使会议不能顺利进行，不能获得积极的结果。因此，美国侵略集团就采取了更加伪善的和更加恶毒的手法，展开破坏亚非会议的阴谋活动。但据合众社报道，华盛顿的官员却把这种阴谋活动说成是对亚非会议的“仁慈的中立”态度。马尼拉条约参加国在曼谷会议上通过的
  “祝贺”亚非会议的决议，大概就是采取这种“仁慈的中立”态度的开始。从此美国官方和宣传机器就改变腔调，不再公开宣传亚非会议“是反对西方的一个行动”。人们知道，这并不是由于美国侵略集团居然改变了对亚非会议的看法，也不是由于亚非会议改变了性质，而是由于美国侵略集团自己感觉到，这样的伪装更加便利于进行破坏亚非会议的阴谋活动。
    首先，他们换了一套欺骗和引诱的伎俩，如把五项原则同马尼拉条约和“太平洋宪章”硬扯在一起，表示“支持各国人民的独立和自决”（艾森豪威尔语），“希望”亚非会议“能够推进民族独立的思想”（杜勒斯语）。他们还放出空气说要帮助“亚洲友好国家”把“原子能用于和平用途”，并在亚非会议的前夕，由艾森豪威尔提出所谓对“亚洲弧形地带”的“经济援助计划”，宣传要“协助亚洲国家工业化”和“提高亚洲人民的生活水平”，所有这些，都不过是利用各式各样的伪装，来遮掩自己的丑恶面目，迷惑亚非国家和人民的视听，并转移亚非会议的目标罢了。它所追求的真实目的，正好和它说的相反。
    为了破坏亚非会议，美国官方和宣传机器在参加亚非会议的国家间，进行极端无耻的挑拨离间和诬蔑造谣。他们挑拨阿拉伯国家之间的关系，挑拨科伦坡国家之间的关系，等等。他们毫不掩饰地胁迫某些国家在亚非会议上“抵抗中立主义的压力”。美国驻黎巴嫩大使马利克三月二十日公开表示“美国人将设法同尽可能多的阿拉伯国家结盟，来在亚非会议上同共产主义影响作斗争”。他们的做法是如此露骨，以致菲律宾官方也由于被认为“将在万隆充当‘美国之音’的角色而感到恼怒”（合众社马尼拉八日电）。
    美国官方和宣传机器挑拨中国和其他国家特别是中国和印度之间的关系，更不遗余力。他们一再捏造中国要“夺取亚非世界领导权”，“万隆的幕后斗争主要将是印度共和国和共产党中国之间的竞争”等谰言。甚至在中印两国人民为中国代表团工作人员座机被美蒋特务预谋失事而无比愤慨的时候，他们也没有忘记利用这一事件作为挑拨中印关系的材料。
    美国侵略集团非常害怕亚非国家通过亚非会议的广泛接触，将增进对中华人民共和国的了解和友谊。据英国“星期日泰晤士报”透露，美国国务院的恐惧竟达到了“毛骨悚然”的程度。“使美国毛骨悚然的是这种想法：中国共产党在万隆同美国所特别希望不要受中国传染的那些国家的政治家们进行直接联系。”因此，美国官方和宣传机器不仅加工制造关于“共产党威胁”的神话，并在中国的少数民族问题、华侨问题、国界问题以及其他问题上，进行恶意的诬蔑，来挑拨中国和许多国家之间的关系。
    由此可见，美帝国主义者的所谓“仁慈的中立”态度，原来就是要在亚非会议中造成互相猜疑，互不信任的气氛，如美国国际新闻社的华盛顿消息所暗示，使会议发生“千百种小问题”，“分裂而瓦解”。这难道还不明白吗？
    美国侵略集团指使蒋匪帮特务在东南亚许多地区，进行各种颠覆破坏活动，是人所共知的事实。最近美蒋特务更以全力来破坏亚非会议的顺利进行。据“印度尼西亚新闻”揭露，同美国特务机关有密切联系的蒋匪恐怖组织“铁血团”，正同印度尼西亚武装匪徒进行接触，以便在亚非会议开会期间进行骚扰和暗害活动，“在日本和菲律宾的许多国民党分子将伪装成参加亚非会议的代表和新闻记者”。据雅加达报纸报道，台湾和匿居香港的蒋匪分子，藉美国在香港的特务机关的帮助，不断有人潜入印度尼西亚。与此同时，大批形迹可疑的美国
  “旅行家”也纷纷前往雅加达和万隆。合众社三月三十日从雅加达发出报道说，在亚非会议上“安全最成问题的当然是周恩来……”。美国的通讯社公然鼓励在美国直接指挥下的蒋匪特务恐怖活动，公然煽动蒋匪特务对以周恩来总理为首的中国代表团人员进行谋杀，这当然不是偶然的。
    由此可见，美帝国主义和蒋匪帮是把特务恐怖活动作为破坏亚非会议的整个阴谋计划中的一个重要方面。美国的所谓“仁慈的中立”态度，原来就是在“祝贺”亚非会议的伪装下，干着毫无人性的谋杀勾当。他们企图以特务暗害活动，造成不安空气，加剧紧张局势，使亚非会议不能顺利进行。
    但是，美国侵略集团不论如何千方百计地来破坏亚非会议，它的阴谋决不能得逞。亚非人民一定要争取亚非会议的顺利进行，一定要使亚非会议对维护亚非地区的和平和促进亚非各国的友好合作，作出有益的贡献。
