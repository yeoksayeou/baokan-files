The Result of Cheating for Honor is Disgrace
    --Recording How Kang Zhaowen, Former Secretary of the General Party Branch of the Small Rolling Mill of Anshan Iron and Steel, Stole the Achievements of Workers
  　Our Reporter　Chang Gong
    The Small Rolling Mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company is a factory known throughout the country for carrying out mass movements to improve old equipment through mechanization and automation. In September 1952, after worker Zhang Mingshan successfully created the anti-skid disc, the staff and workers transformed many backward equipment into mechanized and automated equipment, improved working conditions, and increased labor productivity, setting an example for the renovation of backward equipment in China's original factories and mines.
    However, for more than two years, while the mechanization and automation movement has been carried out enthusiastically across the country, the Small Rolling Mill, the source of this movement, has remained silent. Many equipment needed improvement, but no one created it; some employees had creations, but they locked them in boxes and were unwilling to take them out; or they took them to other factories for production. For a period of time, the Small Rolling Mill could not even complete its production plan.
    The reason for this abnormal phenomenon is that Kang Zhaowen, the former Deputy Secretary of the General Party Branch Committee of the Small Rolling Mill (Secretary of the General Branch Committee from July 1953), despicably stole the southern steel-turning machine suggestion created by the workers and carried out attacks and framed the main creator, Han Changxin. This greatly frustrated and suppressed the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers.
    In September 1952, the Anshan Municipal People's Government awarded Zhang Mingshan the glorious title of Special-Class Labor Model. The Anshan Municipal Party Committee called on everyone to take the road of mechanization and automation, to strive for inventions and creations, and to improve existing equipment. Under the encouragement and support of the Party, the staff and workers of the small factory put forward many significant suggestions for improving old equipment. These employees were promptly commended and rewarded. Seeing that many people had creations and received honors, Kang Zhaowen became envious. At that time, Kang Zhaowen was the Deputy Secretary of the General Branch Committee of the small factory. As a leading cadre of the Party organization, his responsibility should have been to lead this collective well so that this collective could make more and greater contributions to the Party and the country. The honor of the collective is also the honor of the leading cadres of the Party. However, Kang Zhaowen did not think this way. He was wholeheartedly pursuing personal honor. Of course, the Party would also welcome it if Kang Zhaowen could truly create something. However, he had only been a steel-rolling worker for seven months, and he neither understood technology nor usually studied his work, so it was naturally difficult for him to have any major technical creations. Therefore, Kang Zhaowen, like the bourgeoisie exploiting the fruits of workers' labor, adopted the method of reaping without sowing to cheat for honor.
    Han Changxin is an oxygen welding worker. Seeing that the workers on the roughing mill were carrying out heavy and dangerous labor at a high temperature of 1,200 degrees every day, he was determined to create an automatic steel-turning machine. In July 1951, he put forward the suggestion to create a southern steel-turning machine. He talked about this suggestion with engineer Zhou Renyuan for forty or fifty times, hoping to get his help and support. However, Zhou Renyuan did not pay attention to the workers' rationalization suggestions at all, so he ignored Han Changxin's suggestion. After Zhang Mingshan successfully created the anti-skid disc in September 1952, Han Changxin again explained this suggestion in detail to Kang Zhaowen and even drew pictures for Kang Zhaowen to see, hoping to get his support. However, Kang Zhaowen did not help him realize this suggestion. This suggestion was thus shelved. Later, Han Changxin put forward the suggestion to create a northern steel-turning machine. This suggestion was supported by Yan Ming, the factory director and secretary of the general branch, and trial production began. Han Changxin saw that the northern steel-turning machine had been approved and thought that there would be no problem with the southern steel-turning machine, so he also made trial-produced parts for the southern steel-turning machine. At this time, Kang Zhaowen saw that the northern steel-turning machine was likely to be made and thought that Han Changxin's suggestion for the southern steel-turning machine also had the possibility of success. At this time, he extended his despicable hand and openly took Han Changxin's suggestion as his own.
    One day, Kang Zhaowen and Zhou Renyuan took a car home, and Kang Zhaowen told Zhou Renyuan about Han Changxin's suggestion as his own. Zhou Renyuan clearly knew that it was Han Changxin's suggestion, but in order to please his superiors, Zhou Renyuan openly lied for Kang Zhaowen and helped Kang Zhaowen cheat for honor. When the trial production of the southern steel-turning machine was about to succeed, Kang Zhaowen intentionally asked Zhou Renyuan: "Is the southern steel-turning machine made according to my suggestion?" Zhou Renyuan replied: "It is made according to your suggestion." After the trial production of the southern steel-turning machine was successful, when the trade union found them two to inquire who the creator was in order to give a reward, Kang Zhaowen said: "It was made by Engineer Zhou"; Zhou Renyuan hurriedly said: "It was Secretary Kang's suggestion."
    From then on, Kang Zhaowen became the main creator of the southern steel-turning machine. Therefore, he wore flowers, took photos, and his name was on the honor roll. Kang Zhaowen and Zhou Renyuan also became one of the typical examples of the "combination" of labor and technology in the mechanization and automation movement of the small factory, while Han Changxin, the main creator who had put in countless efforts, was left aside.

      II
    Han Changxin certainly could not agree with Kang Zhaowen's shameless act of theft. At the Anshan Iron and Steel's reward meeting for the small factory's mechanization and automation on January 30, 1953, Han Changxin made a report, criticizing the various obstacles he encountered in creating the steel-turning machine. However, Kang Zhaowen not only did not recognize the despicable and shameful nature of this act of theft, but on the contrary, he was determined to maintain this fraudulently obtained honor at all costs, and finally stepped onto the path of opposing the Party step by step.
    After the meeting, many factories felt that Han Changxin had a strong fighting spirit and was educational for the staff and workers, so they asked Han Changxin to give reports. Kang Zhaowen was afraid of exposing his despicable behavior, so he did not allow Han Changxin to speak and questioned Han Changxin: "Are the words you said at the meeting all facts?" He threatened him: "No matter who you have opinions about, we know your good deeds anyway, and we also know your bad deeds." Han Changxin was not frightened by his threat and told him: "Anyway, I have not done anything wrong, and I am not afraid of anything." When threats did not work, Kang Zhaowen wanted to soften and win him over. He invited Han Changxin to his home for dinner and told him, "You are good in everything, but you like to talk nonsense. You should correct it." Han Changxin retorted his words again.
    Kang Zhaowen was so despicable that he used the name of the Party and abused the power given to him by the Party to do evil. He instructed Zhang Zeguo, a member of the general branch committee, to go to Han Changxin's home and openly made such a request to Han Changxin, saying, "Secretary Kang represents the Party and represents Chairman Mao. Since your invention and creation are for the Party, then what is wrong with counting your creation to Secretary Kang?" Han Changxin rejected this shameless request. Kang Zhaowen further carried out attacks and framed Han Changxin. He described Han Changxin's dissatisfaction with him as dissatisfaction with the Party; he sent people to investigate Han Changxin's history, trying to find some materials from it to frame him; he asked Han Changxin's group leader, squad leader, and the Party branch secretary to monitor Han Changxin; and he spread bad words about Han Changxin everywhere, so that the masses had a bad impression of Han and dared not approach him.
    Kang Zhaowen also wanted to drive Han Changxin out of the small factory in order to eliminate future troubles. In March 1953, Han Changxin had a small dispute with a cadre of the sanatorium and air defense command. Kang Zhaowen took the opportunity to scold Han Changxin severely, saying that he had bad character, had been making mistakes all along, and was not worthy of being a worker. Han Changxin was so angry that he cried bitterly. In June 1953, Han Changxin found something similar to oil in the oxygen meter and was afraid of danger, so he reported it to the factory. Kang Zhaowen immediately seized this opportunity to further frame Han Changxin, insisting that Han Changxin put the oil in and asking him what his "intentions" were, and proclaiming that he would "send him to the court and detain him." He forced Han Changxin to want to hang himself, but fortunately, an old worker comforted Han Changxin, telling him that under the leadership of the Communist Party, there were no problems that could not be solved. Only then did Han Changxin resolve to continue the struggle with Kang Zhaowen.
    Later, Kang Zhaowen instructed the administrative cadres of the workshop not to give Han Changxin work, instructed the trade union not to allow Han Changxin to continue to participate in the rationalization proposal group, and, moreover, did not adopt many rationalization proposals that Han Changxin continued to put forward. Finally, after the factory director Yan Ming and others were transferred out of the small factory, Kang Zhaowen did not even allow the northern steel-turning machine, which had been initially trial-produced, to be made. Han Changxin was finally forced to leave the small factory and transferred to the special construction project company.

    III
    People want to ask, does the small factory not have a Party organization? Did the Party organization not know anything about this matter? The General Branch Committee of the small factory knew about this matter from the beginning. However, the General Branch Committee was corroded by sectarianism and liberalism and completely lost its combat effectiveness, and in fact, it had long been covering up Kang Zhaowen's anti-Party behavior.
    Zhang Zeguo, the General Branch Organization Committee member, was promoted by Kang Zhaowen, and Kang Zhaowen increased his salary by four levels during this period. Therefore, he had always been willing to be driven by Kang Zhaowen to make such shameless requests to Han Changxin several times; when the higher leading organs came to investigate this incident, he reversed right and wrong, concealed the truth, and deceived the Party's leading organs; when Yan Ming fought against Kang Zhaowen, he helped Kang Zhaowen attack Yan Ming. Zhang Zeguo had completely become Kang Zhaowen's capable assistant in carrying out anti-Party activities.
    Liu Tingfeng, the General Branch Committee member and chairman of the trade union, was also a cadre promoted by Kang Zhaowen. Before the meeting, Han Changxin had raised his opinions to Liu Tingfeng, and he continued to raise them to Liu Tingfeng later. However, Liu Tingfeng always blindly believed that Kang Zhaowen would not do such a thing. In addition, Han Changxin had criticized the trade union cadres at the meeting, and he was dissatisfied with Han Changxin. Therefore, he said that Han Changxin was fighting for credit, had "historical problems," and had a "bad character," just like Kang Zhaowen. Later, this matter had become very noisy, and the General Branch Secretary Yan Ming asked him to investigate. Liu Tingfeng simply talked to a few people, some of whom had been won over by Kang Zhaowen, and some of whom did not know the situation. He did not conduct a serious investigation, and he still affirmed that Kang Zhaowen had no mistakes. At the same time, because Liu Tingfeng had opinions about Yan Ming, he wrote a report to the higher-level trade union without any basis, saying that Yan Ming was "proud and arrogant, did not put the Party and mass organizations in his eyes, was making trouble in the Party-government relationship, and wanted to get rid of Kang Zhaowen," and even dragged this serious principled struggle into an unprincipled dispute. When Yan Ming raised this issue at the General Branch Committee, Liu Tingfeng had been defending Kang Zhaowen. Later, Liu Tingfeng knew the truth of the matter. However, Kang Zhaowen threatened him, and Liu Tingfeng held the bad attitude of "not saying anything unless he leaves the small factory" and continued to conceal the truth of the matter. It was not until he went to study in May 1954 that he told about this matter. Although Liu Tingfeng did not directly help Kang Zhaowen carry out anti-Party activities like Zhang Zeguo, his sectarian sentiments and personal concerns were in fact a strong support for Kang Zhaowen's anti-Party activities.
    Yan Ming, the General Branch Secretary and factory director at the time, had fought against Kang Zhaowen's despicable behavior. He had also repeatedly talked to Kang Zhaowen, and he had also designated someone to conduct an investigation and raised it for discussion at the General Branch Committee. However, these struggles encountered resistance from sectarian sentiments. Later, he also found Kang Zhaowen and Wang Zhen, the director of the Rolling Mill Department who was sent by the Anshan Municipal Party Committee to help work in the small factory, and formally raised this issue. Kang Zhaowen refused to admit it. Wang Zhen treated this issue with an extremely serious bureaucratic attitude. He believed that this was a "quarrel" between Yan Ming and Kang Zhaowen, so he simply ignored it. At the same time, Yan Ming himself had indeed developed pride and complacency, and Kang Zhaowen took the opportunity to attack and retaliate against Yan Ming. The struggle encountered difficulties, and Yan Ming began to waver, fearing that the matter would not be clarified and that he would get into trouble himself. Therefore, he no longer maintained the interests of the Party and adopted a decadent liberal attitude towards this matter. He neither continued to fight nor directly reported to the Municipal Party Committee, and in fact, he condoned Kang Zhaowen's anti-Party activities.

    IV
    The reason why Kang Zhaowen dared to act so recklessly and the Party General Branch of the small factory was so lacking in combat effectiveness was inseparable from the Anshan Municipal Party Committee's long-term abandonment of leadership over the small factory.
    When the Anshan Municipal Party Committee and relevant leading organs rewarded Kang Zhaowen, they only relied on the materials reported from below, and they did not conduct any investigation and verification work themselves. Moreover, after Kang Zhaowen was wrongly rewarded, the staff and workers of the small factory discussed it a lot. Some said: "Kang Zhaowen never made any suggestions at all, just adding his name"; others said: "Don't mention that matter, it's too dirty!" The Anshan Municipal Party Committee also did not try to listen to the opinions of the masses. On the contrary, after the small factory became famous throughout the country, not only did they not try to strengthen their leadership over the small factory so that the work in all aspects of the small factory could be done better, but they rarely asked about the situation of the small factory. For more than two years, the mechanization and automation movement of the small factory was silent, and the Anshan Municipal Party Committee turned a blind eye to this issue and never conducted a practical and in-depth inspection. Some responsible cadres of the Municipal Party Committee had personally resolved the problem of disunity between Yan Ming and Kang Zhaowen. In fact, Yan Ming's struggle against Kang Zhaowen's act of theft was one of the important reasons for their disunity. When dealing with this issue, if the Municipal Party Committee could pay a little attention to promoting democracy and allow Yan Ming to speak freely, Kang Zhaowen's act of theft could have been exposed at that time. From March 1953, Han Changxin began to file complaints to many leading organs and responsible cadres of Anshan City for more than a hundred times in twenty months. However, no organ and no one seriously clarified this issue. It was not until July 1954, due to Han Changxin's urging and the fact that the inspection team of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection in Anshan inquired about this case, that the Anshan Municipal Party Committee instructed the General Branch Committee of the small factory under the leadership of the Industry and Mining Department to clarify this issue. In order to strictly enforce Party discipline and purify the Party ranks, the Anshan Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China has expelled Kang Zhaowen, this anti-Party element, from the Party and has imposed sanctions and criticisms on the relevant people. From this, we should draw a lesson: People who want to cheat for honor by improper means will not only not get honor, but will only get the shameful end of disgrace; if the Party's leading organs are only satisfied with the appearance of "banners" and "models" in their affiliated units, and no longer supervise and inspect the working conditions of the model units, not only will the existing "models" and "banners" not be consolidated and lasting, but it will also greatly facilitate those fake models who cheat for honor.

    骗取荣誉的结果是身败名裂
    ——记前中共鞍钢小型轧钢厂总支书记康兆文窃夺工人创造的经过
  　本报记者　常工
    鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂是以开展群众性的改进旧设备的机械化自动化运动而闻名全国的一个工厂。一九五二年九月，在这个工厂里，工人张明山创造反围盘成功后，职工们又把许多落后的设备改变成机械化自动化的设备，改善了劳动条件，提高了劳动生产率，为我国原有厂矿改造落后设备树立了榜样。
    但是，两年多以来，当机械化自动化运动在全国各地热烈开展的时候，这个运动策源地的小型轧钢厂却一直是无声无息，许多设备需要改进，没有人去创造了；有些职工有了创造，也把它锁在箱子里，不愿意拿出来；或者是拿到别的工厂去制作，有一个时期，小型轧钢厂甚至连生产计划也完不成。
    产生这种反常现象的原因，是前中共小型轧钢厂总支委员会副书记（一九五三年七月任总支书记）康兆文卑鄙地窃取了工人创造的南部翻钢机建议，并对主要创造者韩长信施行打击和陷害。这样就大大挫折和压制了工人的积极性和创造性。一
    一九五二年九月，鞍山市人民政府奖给张明山特等劳动模范的光荣称号。鞍山市委号召大家走机械化自动化的道路，努力创造发明，改进现有设备。在党的鼓励和支持下，小型厂的职工群众提出了许多有重大意义的改进旧设备的建议。这些职工都及时地受到了表扬和奖励。看到许多人都有了创造得到了荣誉，康兆文的眼红了。当时，康兆文是小型厂总支委员会的副书记。作为党组织的领导干部，他的责任应该是领导好这个集体，使这个集体能够对党和国家有更多更大的贡献。集体的荣誉也就是党的领导干部的荣誉。康兆文却不是这样想，他一心追求个人的荣誉。如果康兆文自己真正能够有所创造，党当然也是欢迎的。但是，他只当过七个月的轧钢工人，既不懂技术，平常又不钻研业务，自然很难在技术上有什么重大的创造。于是康兆文就像资产阶级剥削工人的劳动成果一样，采用不劳而获的办法去骗取荣誉。
    韩长信是一个氧焊工人。他看到毛轧机上的工人，每天在一千二百度的高温下进行着笨重危险的劳动，他就决心要创造自动翻钢机。一九五一年七月，他提出了创造南部翻钢机的建议。他把这个建议和工程师周任源先后谈过四、五十次，希望得到他的帮助和支持。但是周任源根本不重视工人的合理化建议，所以对韩长信的建议一直是置之不理。一九五二年九月张明山创造反围盘成功以后，韩长信又把这个建议详细地同康兆文讲过，还给康兆文画过图看，希望得到他的支持。但是康兆文也没有帮助他实现这个建议。这个建议就这样搁浅了。以后，韩长信又提出了创造北部翻钢机的建议。这个建议得到该厂厂长兼总支书记燕鸣的支持，开始试作。韩长信看北部翻钢机已被批准，认为南部翻钢机也没有问题，也就为南部翻钢机作了试制的部件。就在这个时候，康兆文看到北部翻钢机有制成的可能，想着韩长信南部翻钢机的建议也有成功的可能，这时他便伸出了卑污的手，公然把韩长信的建议据为己有。
    有一天，康兆文和周任源坐汽车回家，就把韩长信的建议，作为自己的建议向周任源讲了一遍。周任源明明知道是韩长信的建议，可是，为了讨好上级，周任源就公然地替康兆文说谎，帮助康兆文骗取荣誉。当南部翻钢机试制快要成功时，康兆文就有意地问周任源：“南部翻钢机是按照我提的那样做的吗？”周任源回答说：“是按照你的建议制作的。”南部翻钢机试制成功后，工会找到他们两个来询问创造者是谁以便给予奖励时，康兆文说：“是周工程师做的”；周任源赶忙说：“是康书记的建议。”
    从此，康兆文就成为南部翻钢机的主要创造者，于是带花、照像，名字上了光荣榜。康兆文、周任源还成了小型厂机械化自动化运动中劳动和技术“结合”的典型之一，而真正付出了无数心血的主要创造者韩长信却被丢在一边了。
      二
    韩长信当然不能同意康兆文这样无耻的盗窃行为。在一九五三年一月三十日鞍钢举行的奖励小型厂机械化自动化大会上，韩长信作了报告，对他在创造翻钢机中受到各种阻碍进行了批评。但是，康兆文不但没有认识到这种窃夺行为的卑鄙可耻，相反地，下定决心不惜一切地来保持这骗取来的荣誉，终于一步步地走上了反党的道路。
    会后，许多工厂感到韩长信斗争精神很强，对职工有教育意义，就纷纷地请韩长信去作报告。康兆文害怕把他的卑鄙行为揭露，就不让韩长信去讲话，并且质问韩长信：“你在大会上讲的话都是事实吗？”威胁他：“不管你对谁有意见，反正你的好事我们知道，你的坏事我们也知道。”韩长信没有被他的威胁吓倒，告诉他：“反正我没作亏心事，我什么也不怕。”威胁不行，康兆文又想软化拉拢。他请韩长信到家里吃饭，向他表示“你什么都好，就是爱乱讲，应该好好改正”。韩长信又把他的话顶了回去。
    康兆文竟然卑鄙到假借党的名义和滥用党交给他的职权去为非作歹。他指使总支委员张泽国到韩长信家去，公然向韩长信提出这样的要求，说什么“康书记是代表党的，是代表毛主席的，你发明创造既是为了党，那末把你的创造算给康书记又有什么不可以呢？”韩长信拒绝了这个无耻的要求。康兆文就进一步对韩长信施行打击和陷害。他把韩长信对他的不满说成是对党的不满；他派人调查韩长信的历史，想从中找出一些供他进行陷害的材料；他要韩长信的组长、班长、党的支部书记监视韩长信；并到处说韩长信的坏话，使群众对韩印象不好，不敢和他接近。
    康兆文还一心想把韩长信赶出小型厂，以便除去后患。一九五三年三月，韩长信在业余疗养所和防空指挥部的一个干部有了些小争执。康兆文乘机就把韩长信大训一顿，说他品质恶劣，一贯犯错误，配不上当个工人。气得韩长信痛哭流涕。一九五三年六月间，有一次韩长信发现氧气表里有类似油的东西，恐怕发生危险，就向厂部作了报告。康兆文立刻抓住了这个机会，进一步陷害韩长信，一口咬定油是韩长信放的，追问他是“什么企图”，声言要把他“送到法院里扣押起来”。又逼得韩长信想上吊自杀，幸亏一个老工人对韩长信进行了劝慰，告诉他在共产党领导下，没有解决不了的问题，韩长信这才又决心和康兆文继续斗争。
    以后，康兆文指使车间行政干部不给韩长信工作，指使工会不让韩长信继续参加合理化建议小组，而且，对韩长信继续提出的许多合理化建议，根本不采纳。最后，当厂长燕鸣等调出小型厂后，连已经初步试制成功的北部翻钢机，康兆文也不让作了，韩长信终于被迫离开了小型厂，转到基本建设特殊工程公司去了。三
    人们要问，小型厂难道没有党组织吗？党组织难道一点也不知道这件事吗？小型厂的总支委员会是在一开始就知道这件事的。但是，总支委员会被宗派主义和自由主义腐蚀得完全丧失了战斗力，事实上长期地掩护了康兆文的反党行为。
    总支组织委员张泽国是康兆文一手提拔的，而且康兆文在这个期间一连给他增加了四级工资，于是，他就一直自甘受康兆文驱使，去向韩长信几次提出那样无耻的要求；当上级领导机关来调查这个事件时，他颠倒是非隐瞒真相欺骗党的领导机关；当燕鸣向康兆文进行斗争时，他帮助康兆文打击燕鸣。张泽国已经完全成为康兆文进行反党活动的得力帮手了。
    总支委员兼工会主席刘廷峰也是康兆文坚持提拔起来的干部，在大会以前，韩长信就找刘廷峰提了意见，以后又继续向刘廷峰提过。但是刘廷峰却总盲目地认为康兆文不会干这样的事。加上韩长信在大会上批评过工会干部，他对韩长信不满意，因此，他就和康兆文一样说韩长信是争功、有“历史问题”、“品质不好”。后来，这件事已经吵嚷得很厉害，总支书记燕鸣让他调查，刘廷峰只是简单地找了几个人谈谈，其中有几个是已经被康兆文拉了过去的，有的是不了解情况的，没有认真的进行调查，他就仍然一口肯定说康兆文没有错误。同时，因为刘廷峰对燕鸣有意见，这时就毫无根据地向上级工会写报告，说燕鸣“骄傲自大，不把党和群众组织放在眼里，闹党政关系，想整掉康兆文”等，竟然把这场严肃的原则斗争扯到无原则纠纷上去。当燕鸣在总支委员会上提出这个问题时，刘廷峰一直为康兆文辩护。后来刘廷峰知道了事情的真象。但是康兆文对他进行威胁，刘廷峰就抱着“不出小型厂不说”的恶劣态度，继续地隐瞒事情的真相。直到一九五四年五月他去学习时，才把这事讲出来。刘廷峰虽然不像张泽国那样直接帮助康兆文进行反党活动。但是，他的宗派情绪和个人顾虑，事实上对于康兆文的反党活动却是一个有力支持。
    当时的总支书记兼厂长燕鸣对康兆文的这种卑鄙行为是进行了斗争的。他也曾一再地同康兆文进行过谈话，也曾指定专人进行调查，并在总支委员会上提出讨论。但是这些斗争却遇到了宗派情绪的阻挠。后来，他又把康兆文和鞍山市委工矿部派在小型厂帮助工作的轧钢处处长王珍找到一起，正式提出这个问题。康兆文不肯承认。王珍用极端严重的官僚主义态度对待这个问题，他认为这是燕鸣和康兆文两个人之间的“扯皮”事情，因而根本不予理会。同时，燕鸣本身也确实滋长了骄傲自满情绪，康兆文更趁机对燕鸣进行打击报复。斗争遇到了困难，燕鸣就动摇起来，害怕事情搞不清楚，自己反弄一身不是。于是，他就不再维护党的利益，对这件事采取了腐朽的自由主义态度，既不继续进行斗争，也不直接向市委反映，事实上也就纵容了康兆文的反党活动。四
    康兆文所以敢如此胡作非为，小型厂党总支所以如此丧失战斗力，这是与中共鞍山市委会长期地放弃对小型厂的领导分不开的。
    鞍山市委和有关的领导机关在奖励康兆文时，只凭下面汇报的材料，自己根本没有作过任何调查核对工作。而且在错误地奖励了康兆文以后，小型厂的职工议论纷纷，有的说：“康兆文根本没提过意见，不过应个名而已”，有的说：“别提那事，太脏！”鞍山市委也没有设法倾听一下群众的意见。相反地，当小型厂在全国出名以后，他们不但没有设法加强对小型厂的领导，使小型厂各方面的工作能够作得更好，反而很少过问小型厂的情况。两年多以来，小型厂的机械化自动化运动无声无息了，鞍山市委竟然对这个问题熟视无睹，始终没有作过一次切实深入的检查。市委的一些负责干部曾经亲自解决过燕鸣和康兆文的不团结问题。实际上，燕鸣对康兆文的窃夺行为进行斗争正是他们两个不团结的重要原因之一。市委在处理这个问题时，如果能够稍稍注意发扬民主，使燕鸣能够畅所欲言，康兆文的窃夺行为当时也就可以被揭发出来。从一九五三年三月起，韩长信就开始向鞍山市许多领导机关和负责干部进行控告，二十个月中，不下一百多次，但是，没有一个机关没有一个人认真负责地弄清这个问题。直到一九五四年七月间，由于韩长信催的很紧，同时中央纪律检查委员会到鞍山的检查组过问了这一案件，鞍山市委才责成工矿部领导小型厂总支委员会弄清了这个问题。为了严肃党纪、纯洁党的队伍，中共鞍山市委已经把康兆文这个反党分子开除出党，并对有关的人进行了处分和批评。从这里我们应该得出教训：想用不正当的手段去骗取荣誉的人，不但不能得到荣誉，只能得到身败名裂的可耻下场；党的领导机关如果只满足于自己所属的单位出现了“旗帜”、“模范”，而不再监督和考察模范单位的工作状况，不但已经有的“模范”、“旗帜”不能巩固和持久，而且会给那些骗取荣誉的假模范大开方便之门。
