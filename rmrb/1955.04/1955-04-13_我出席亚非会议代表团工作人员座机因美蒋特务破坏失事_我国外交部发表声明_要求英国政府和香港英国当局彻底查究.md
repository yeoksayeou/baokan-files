    Xinhua News Agency, April 12th – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China issued a statement, the full text of which is as follows:
    Eleven people, including staff members of the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China attending the Asian-African Conference, staff members of the Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Chinese and foreign journalists accompanying them to cover the Asian-African Conference, were aboard a Constellation aircraft chartered by our delegation from Air India International. The plane took off from Hong Kong at 12:15 Beijing time on April 11th, heading to Jakarta to transfer to Bandung. When the plane was flying over the sea northwest of Sarawak, North Borneo, it exploded and caught fire, and the fuselage crashed into the sea. The whereabouts of all personnel on board are unknown.
    This unfortunate incident is by no means an ordinary plane crash, but a premeditated murder by the secret service agencies of the United States and Chiang Kai-shek. Long before these delegation members and journalists set out, the Government of the People's Republic of China had learned that the secret service agencies of the United States and Chiang Kai-shek were actively planning to sabotage the Indian plane to be chartered by our delegation, in order to realize their conspiracy to assassinate the members of the Chinese delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai attending the Asian-African Conference and to undermine the Asian-African Conference. Therefore, at 9:30 on April 10th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China specifically notified the British Chargé d'Affaires in Beijing of this situation, requesting the British Chargé d'Affaires to inform the British authorities in Hong Kong and take measures to ensure the safety of the aforementioned delegation members and journalists. After the officials of the British Chargé d'Affaires inquired about the airline to which the aircraft these personnel were preparing to take belonged, they replied that they would notify the British authorities in Hong Kong by telegram. Despite this, the conspiracy of the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret service agencies still succeeded, and the British Government and the British authorities in Hong Kong are seriously responsible for this unfortunate incident. We demand that the British Government and the British authorities

    我出席亚非会议代表团工作人员座机因美蒋特务破坏失事
    我国外交部发表声明
    要求英国政府和香港英国当局彻底查究
    新华社十二日讯　中华人民共和国外交部声明，全文如下：
    参加亚洲非洲会议的中华人民共和国政府代表团工作人员、越南民主共和国代表团工作人员和随同前往采访亚非会议新闻的中外记者共十一人，乘坐由我国代表团包用的印度国际航空公司的星座式客机一架，于北京时间四月十一日十二时一刻自香港起飞，前往雅加达转赴万隆。该机在飞越北婆罗洲沙捞越西北的海面时，爆炸起火，机身坠入海中，机上全部人员下落不明。
    这一不幸事件绝非一般的飞机失事，而是美国和蒋介石的特务机关蓄意制造的谋杀。早在这批代表团人员和新闻记者启程前，中华人民共和国政府即已获悉，美国和蒋介石的特务机关正积极布置对我国代表团将要包乘的印度飞机进行破坏，以实现它们暗杀我国以周恩来总理为首的参加亚非会议的代表团人员和破坏亚非会议的阴谋。因此，中华人民共和国外交部在四月十日九时半特将这一情况通知了驻北京的英国代办处，要求英国代办处转告香港英国当局注意，并采取措施以保障上述代表团人员和新闻记者的安全。英国代办处的官员问明了这些人员准备乘坐的客机的所属航空公司后，答应用电报通知香港英国当局。尽管如此，美蒋特务机关的阴谋仍然得逞，英国政府和香港英国当局对这次不幸事件是负有严重责任的。我们要求英国政府和香港英国当局对这一事件进行彻底查究，将参与这一阴谋暗害事件的特务分子逮捕法办，以明责任。
    美蒋特务机关对于中华人民共和国参加亚非会议的代表团人员和记者的预谋杀害，不仅是敌视中华人民共和国的疯狂表现，而且是对于即将召开的亚非会议的卑鄙破坏。亚非会议即将召开，这个会议代表着亚洲和非洲拥有十四亿四千万人口的二十九个国家，受到亚非广大人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民的热烈拥护，绝非美国和蒋介石匪帮的任何无耻阴谋所能阻挠和破坏。中华人民共和国代表团一定要同与会各国代表团一起在亚非会议中为远东和平和世界和平而坚决奋斗。美国和蒋介石匪帮的卑劣行为，只能加强亚洲、非洲和全世界人民争取和平和自由的共同行动。
  一九五五年四月十二日
