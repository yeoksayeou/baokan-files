The Problem of "Relationships"
    Lin Wei

    There are quite a few instances like this:

    The responsible cadres of an organization, a factory, a school, or other unit, fail to pay attention to the implementation of financial regulations and financial discipline. They over-report and over-claim, and then spend the money recklessly, wasting the state's resources. When supervisory staff or other personnel see this, they feel it's very wrong, but they don't expose it or fight against it. Why? They are afraid of damaging "relationships," making it difficult to meet and get along with each other in the future.

    A village chief broke the law and was detained by the county court. The district head insisted that the village chief was a good cadre. Because the county court was unwilling to strain its relationship with the district head, it compromised on the law and gave the law-breaking village chief a lenient sentence.

    The Party organization of a factory or mine suffers from serious political paralysis, placing hidden counter-revolutionaries in important positions, leading to the planned destruction of important machinery. The personnel dispatched by the higher-level organization to this factory or mine discover this problem and feel that this Party organization's paralysis should be treated. However, they don't directly offer criticism and suggestions, but instead indirectly ask this person or that person to investigate the situation. Why? It's also because they are afraid that direct criticism will damage "relationships." Later, when the people sent to investigate arrive, it is very difficult to identify the main person responsible for this incident in order to reach a specific, beneficial conclusion and a correct handling of the matter, and to educate the main person responsible. Because no one wants to directly point out the main person responsible. Why? Still the problem of "relationships."

    In the mutual contact between a department, a region, or a comrade with another department, another region, or another comrade, if they discover obvious shortcomings in the other party's work or style, or even very serious problems, very few people can raise them frankly and directly. Usually, they just chat about it among a few "confidants" and express some sentiments.

    At several levels, this atmosphere dominates most people. If someone insists on not considering "relationships," insists on "upholding correct principles at all times and in all places, and waging tireless struggle against all incorrect ideas and behaviors" (Mao Zedong: "Combat Liberalism"), they will receive "well-intentioned" advice: "You're really a bit inflexible!" Or "You lack cultivation," "lack the magnanimity of a great man," "you're not flexible in handling affairs," etc. Some others might even think that this person likes to show off, hinders unity, or something else. Conversely, some people never speak out on any matter of principle, or reconcile any principled disagreement, calling everything "no principled disagreement" in order to smooth things over. These people will be considered steady and experienced, good at handling affairs, and good at uniting people. Here, right and wrong, good and evil lose their boundaries and become a chaotic mess.

    All activities of our Party and state organs, all staff members, all cadres, revolve around one general purpose, one center: the common interests of the country and the people. There are no other private interests. The relationships between us should be the purest, noblest, most honest, most frank, and simplest relationships in human history and human society. The problem of relationships should not be a problem at all. If you are good, I will learn from you. If you have shortcomings or errors, I will offer criticism and suggestions and ask you to correct them. If you correct them, we are still good comrades. Isn't this very simple? But in some aspects, "relationships" have actually become a "problem" and are constantly being considered. How did this strange phenomenon occur? Every party involved can give specific reasons why they must consider the "relationship" problem. The general reason is that "it's impossible to work without good relationships," or at least it will "affect work." Is this true? In some aspects, it is indeed true. The reason is that some people always see others' criticism as "making things difficult" for them, intentionally doing something, or not considering their difficulties and not putting themselves in their shoes, etc. Therefore, when others offer them opinions, some find some objective reasons to explain; some look for similar shortcomings and errors in the other party to show that everyone is like that; and some bad elements deliberately create difficulties for the other party in their work, so that the other party cannot speak out their grievances. The goal is to teach the other party to be a little "smarter," not to offend the powerful, and not to disturb other people's peace. In this situation, the critic feels that even if they report to a higher level, it will be difficult to distinguish right from wrong and solve the problem in a short period of time; if handled poorly, they will even be criticized and blamed themselves. Therefore, they use the principle of "combining principle with flexibility" as an excuse to handle things flexibly, which is actually giving up criticism and struggle on matters of principle, allowing some unreasonable phenomena, incorrect working methods, and ideological styles to continue to exist and develop, letting the problem sit, and allowing the cause of the Party and the people to continue to suffer damage.

    Some people also think this way: whoever has shortcomings will understand them themselves. If the problem is not too serious, it won't cause the sky to fall. If it's too serious, the higher-ups will take care of it, and we can't control it. If there are many similar phenomena, they will feel even more that one more or one less doesn't matter, and there's no need to worry about one thing. These comrades have forgotten that any shortcomings or errors are detrimental to the country and the people. If small shortcomings or errors are not corrected in time, they will develop into large shortcomings or errors; every Communist Party member and revolutionary comrade has the responsibility to offer criticism and conduct struggle against any shortcomings or errors, and to safeguard the interests of the country and the people. If everyone waits for the higher-ups or others to take care of it, and there is no mass criticism and supervision, then many shortcomings and errors will inevitably not be discovered and corrected in time, and will even develop into serious damage to the country and the people.

    We should always maintain a serious and correct comradely relationship between comrades, between superiors and subordinates, between departments, between units, and between regions. This relationship is necessary for carrying out work. And this relationship must obviously be built on the basis of jointly safeguarding the interests of the country and the people. If we sacrifice the interests of the country and the people to seek superficial harmonious relationships, then it is fundamentally meaningless. This becomes unprincipled harmony. This kind of unprincipled harmony can "politically corrupt certain organizations and certain individuals in the Party and revolutionary groups," "cause the revolutionary ranks to lose strict organization and discipline, policies cannot be thoroughly implemented, and the Party organization and the masses led by the Party become isolated," and can also "cause unity to disintegrate, relationships to loosen, work to become passive, and opinions to diverge" (all quotations are from Mao Zedong: "Combat Liberalism"). All of these are extremely beneficial to the enemy and extremely detrimental to the people.

    All Communist Party members and state organ personnel all take "serving the people" as their motto. If we are truly wholeheartedly serving the people and have no consideration of personal gains or losses, then we should, without any discount, follow the instructions and teachings of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, adhere to correct principles at all times and in all places, wage tireless struggle against all incorrect thoughts and behaviors, establish the kind of relationship that truly deserves to be called "comradely relationship" among all comrades, and not let the corrupt and vulgar "relationships" of the old society be confused with our lofty comradely relationships.

### “关系”问题

    “关系”问题
    林韦
    有不少这样的事情——
    一个机关、一个工厂、学校或其他单位的负责干部不注意执行财政制度和财政纪律，对上浮报多领，领来了就胡乱开支，浪费了国家的物力财力。监察工作人员或者其他工作人员看到了，觉得很不对，但是不揭发也不斗争。为什么？怕搞坏“关系”，以后不好见面，不好相处。
    一个村长犯了法，被县法院扣押起来了。区长硬说那个村长是好干部。县法院因为不愿意同区长把关系搞僵，就在法律上打折扣，从轻处理了这个犯法的村长。
    一个厂矿的党组织在政治上有严重的麻痹病，把暗藏的反革命分子放到了重要的岗位，以致重要的机器被有计划地破坏了。上级机关派驻这个厂矿的工作人员发现了这一问题，觉得应该治一下这个党组织的麻痹病，但是他不直接提出批评和建议，却转弯抹角地转请这儿那儿派人去了解情况。为什么？也是怕直接提出批评会把“关系”搞坏。以后，被派来了解情况的人到了，要了解这一事件的主要责任者，以便作出具体的有益的结论和正确的处理，教育主要的责任者，也是非常困难的事。因为谁也不愿意直接了当指出主要的责任者来。为什么？还是“关系”问题。
    一个部门，一个地区，一个同志，在同另一个部门，另一个地区，另一个同志的相互接触中发现对方在工作上和作风上有很明显的毛病，甚至是很严重的问题，但是很少有人能坦白直率地提出来，通常是在几个“知己者”中间聊一聊，发一点感慨。
    在若干环节上，这种空气支配着大部分人。如果有一个人硬是不考虑什么“关系”，硬是要“无论何时何地，坚持正确的原则，同一切不正确的思想和行为作不疲倦的斗争”（毛泽东：“反对自由主义”），他就会受到“善意”的劝告：“你这人真有点迂！”或者是“你这人缺乏涵养”，“缺乏大丈夫的雅量”，“办事不灵活，不通达”，等等。另外一些人甚至还会认为这个人喜欢显露自己，妨碍团结，或者其他。相反地，有些人对任何原则问题都不开口，或者对任何原则分歧都来一个调和，都说成“没有原则分歧”，以图息事宁人，这些人就会被人认为稳重老练，会办事，会团结人。在这里，是非邪正失去了界线，成为混沌一片。
    我们的党和国家机关以及所有的工作人员，所有的干部，大家的一切活动都围绕着一个总的目的，一个中心，这就是国家和人民的共同利益。此外并无其他任何私利。我们中间的关系，应该是人类历史上和人类社会中最纯朴、最高贵、最诚实、最坦白也最简单的关系。关系问题本来是不应该成为问题的。你好，我就向你学习。你有缺点、错误，我就向你提出批评和建议，请你改正。改正了，大家还是好同志。这不是十分简单吗？但是在某些环节上，“关系”居然成了“问题”，被经常考虑着，这种怪现象是怎么发生的呢？每一个当事人，都可以说出一些必须考虑“关系”问题的具体理由。一般的理由，则是“不搞好关系没法工作”，至少是要“影响工作”。这是不是事实呢？在有些环节上的确是事实。原因是有些人总是把人家对自己的批评看成对自己“过不去”，有意如何如何，或者是不照顾自己的困难，不能设身处地为自己想想，等等。所以在人家对自己提出意见的时候，有的就找出一些客观原因来作解释；有的就寻找对方一些类似的缺点、错误，说明大家都如此；还有一些恶劣分子，则故意在工作中给对方制造困难，使对方有苦说不出来。目的是要对方学“聪明”一点，不要再来太岁头上动土，不要再来扰乱别人的平静。在这种情形下，批评者就觉得即使向上级反映，也很难在短时期内分清是非，解决问题；弄得不好，还会使自己受到批评指责。所以就引用“原则性要和灵活性结合起来”的原则作借口，来作灵活的处理，实际就是放弃原则问题上的批评和斗争，让一些不合理的现象、不正确的工作方法和思想作风继续保存和发展下去，让问题搁着，让党和人民的事业继续遭受损害。
    也有一些人是这样想的：谁有什么毛病，谁自己会懂得的。问题如果不太严重，就那样下去也塌不了天。太严重了，上级会过问的，咱管不着。如果同类的现象很多，他们就更会觉得多一件少一件都是一样，用不着为一件事情而着急。这些同志忘记了一点，就是任何缺点、错误都是对国家和人民不利的，小的缺点、错误如果不及时纠正，就会发展成大的缺点、错误；任何共产党员和革命同志都有责任对任何缺点、错误提出批评，进行斗争，维护国家和人民的利益。如果都等着上级或别人去管，而没有群众性的批评和监督，就势必会有许多缺点、错误不能被及时发现和纠正，以致发展成对国家对人民的严重损害。
    我们应该在同志间、上下间、部门间、单位间和地区间永远保持严肃的正确的同志式的关系。这种关系是进行工作所必需的。而这种关系显然必须建立在共同维护国家和人民利益的基础上。如果牺牲了国家和人民的利益去求得表面上的关系融洽，那就是根本无意义的。这样就成了无原则的一团和气。这种无原则的一团和气，可以“使党和革命团体的某些组织和某些个人在政治上腐化起来”，“使革命队伍失掉严密的组织和纪律，政策不能贯彻到底，党的组织和党所领导的群众发生隔离”，也可以“使团结涣散，关系松懈，工作消极，意见分歧”（以上引文均见毛泽东：“反对自由主义”）。这些都是对敌人极其有利，对人民极其不利的。
    所有的共产党员和国家机关工作人员，大家都是以“为人民服务”为座右铭的。如果真正是全心全意为人民服务，而没有任何个人得失的考虑，那我们就应该不打任何折扣地依照党中央和毛泽东同志的指示和教导，在无论何时何地坚持正确的原则，对一切不正确的思想行为进行不疲倦的斗争，在一切同志间建立起真正称得起“同志关系”的那种关系，不要让旧社会里那种腐朽庸俗的“关系”同我们崇高的同志关系相混淆。
