    In order to promote materialism and criticize bourgeois idealism, the Propaganda Department of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to hold two lectures on materialism in Guiyang City, starting in early April. One is mainly for young cadres, both Party members and non-Party members, from provincial and municipal organizations, focusing on a popular explanation of the basic viewpoints of Marxist epistemology, and linking it with the subjective thinking methods and working methods in actual work. The other is mainly for young intellectuals in the literary and artistic circles and schools, focusing on criticizing the philosophical thought, reactionary political views, historical views, and experimentalist methods of scholarship of bourgeois idealism represented by Hu Shi. The teaching topics for the first stage (April to June) of the two lectures have been determined to be ten, and the first topic will be lectured on the first Sunday of April, entitled "Why should we criticize bourgeois idealism? Why should we study the materialist world outlook?" Afterwards, the two lectures will be given every two weeks. (Our correspondent in Guiyang)

    贵州举办唯物主义讲座
    中共贵州省委宣传部为了宣传唯物主义思想，批判资产阶级唯心主义思想，决定从四月初开始，在贵阳市举办两个唯物主义讲座。一个以省、市机关党内和党外的青年干部为主要对象，着重通俗地解释马克思主义认识论的基本观点，并联系实际工作中的主观主义的思想方法和工作方法；一个以文学艺术界和学校中的青年知识分子为主要对象，着重批判以胡适为代表的资产阶级唯心主义的哲学思想和反动的政治观点、历史观点以及实验主义的治学方法。两个讲座第一阶段（四月到六月）的讲授题目已确定十个，自四月的第一个星期日开始讲第一题，题为“为什么要批判资产阶级唯心主义？为什么要学习唯物主义世界观？”以后两个讲座每两周各讲授一次。　（本报驻贵阳记者）
