Asian and African people are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, and are carrying out the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons in an increasingly broad and in-depth manner.

The Chinese people, in this signature campaign, have once again expressed their firm will to oppose atomic war. In less than two months, more than 400 million people have signed the "Appeal to the People of the World" of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council. The signature campaign is also being enthusiastically carried out in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The people of these countries strongly oppose the conspiracy of the atomic maniacs to destroy the peaceful life of the people of all countries. The Japanese people, who have suffered the disaster of atomic weapons three times, are unyieldingly carrying out the struggle against atomic war. As of March 17 this year, more than 23 million people across Japan have signed petitions demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs. The Indian people held a nationwide "Stop Preparing for Atomic War Day" on March 6, and many famous social figures and politicians signed appeals against atomic war. The people of Indonesia, Burma, and other Asian and African countries have also launched campaigns to collect signatures demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons. The World Peace Council has received the first batch of signature books against the use of atomic weapons from the Congo, Senegal, and Rhodesia in Africa, filled with names and fingerprints.

The Asian Countries Conference recently held in New Delhi passed a resolution calling for the prohibition of the use and testing of weapons of mass slaughter, and the destruction of existing stockpiles, using the same materials for constructive and peaceful development, and suggesting that all of Asia commemorate August 6, 1955, the tenth anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima, as a day of protest against the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. This resolution of the Asian Countries Conference reflects the common will of the people of Asian countries to oppose atomic war.

The widespread and in-depth mass movement against atomic war currently being carried out by the people of Asia and Africa is not accidental. The people of Asia and Africa have long suffered from the enslavement and oppression of imperialism, and have been victims of imperialist aggression more than once; at the same time, the Asian people clearly remember that the first atomic bomb fell on Asian soil, and the first person to die in a hydrogen bomb test was an Asian. Therefore, the people of Asian and African countries are eager to live a life of peace, independence, and freedom, and resolutely oppose the imperialist attempts to increase the scourge of war on their heads, especially the scourge of atomic war.

Since World War II, the people of Asia and Africa have been engaged in the struggle to defend peace and oppose atomic war. The Japanese people shouted the slogan "Don't allow the tragedy of Hiroshima to be repeated" long ago, and this just call has received the sympathy and support of all the people of Asia and Africa. In March 1950, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress passed the Stockholm Appeal, which immediately received the enthusiastic support of the people of Asian and African countries, who launched a large-scale signature campaign for this appeal. At the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing in October 1952, representatives from Asian and African countries unanimously issued a call for "prohibiting the use of atomic, bacteriological, and chemical weapons and other weapons of mass slaughter."

In March 1954, the United States, disregarding the safety of the people of countries in the Pacific region, conducted a hydrogen bomb test in Bikini, which resulted in serious disasters for the Japanese people. This incident aroused great anger among the Japanese people, who jointly condemned and protested against the U.S. death test, and launched a signature campaign demanding the prohibition of the use and testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs. Under the influence of public opinion, both houses of the Japanese Diet and local assemblies passed resolutions demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons.

The just struggle of the Japanese people has received widespread sympathy and support from people of all walks of life in Asian and African countries. Political leaders of various countries have put forward proposals on the prohibition of atomic weapons. Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated in the House of the People on April 2 last year regarding atomic weapons: "The whole world—especially the people of all countries—has deep and widespread unease about these weapons and their terrible consequences." He also pointed out: "It is certainly not enough to feel uneasy; resolute measures must be taken to prevent disaster." The Prime Ministers of the five South Asian countries, after holding a meeting in Bogor last December, issued a communique stating "they are seriously concerned about the destructive potential of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons explosions carried out for testing purposes (which threaten not only their countries but the whole world), and their long-term and as yet undetermined consequences..."

The powerful movement of the people of Asia and Africa and peace-loving people around the world demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons has forced the U.S. imperialists to dare not use atomic weapons in the Korean War and the Indochina War. However, in order to realize its mad goal of seizing world hegemony and enslaving all mankind, the U.S. aggressive bloc has not only not abandoned its crazy plan to provoke an atomic war around the world, but is intensifying its activities to prepare for atomic war. In Europe, the North Atlantic aggressive bloc has passed a decision to use atomic weapons in war, and is preparing to hand over atomic weapons to West German militarists. In Asia, U.S. officials have repeatedly announced that the U.S. military strategy in the Far East is based on the concept of treating atomic bombs as conventional weapons, and threatens to use atomic weapons against the Chinese people and the people of other peace-loving countries. This practice of the U.S. aggressive bloc has greatly increased the danger of atomic war and seriously threatens world peace and security.

This peace-threatening activity of the U.S. aggressive bloc has aroused the indignation and opposition of the people of Asia and Africa. In order to ease the anti-atomic war sentiments of the people of Asian and African countries, the U.S. aggressive bloc attempts to confuse public opinion with deceptive propaganda. Atomic maniacs like Dulles have also come out to spread the argument that atomic weapons are only used for defensive purposes and only used strategically; they even describe atomic weapons that massively slaughter human beings as the most humane weapons. But this argument cannot deceive people. Indian MP Sahib Singh Sokhey has denounced the conspiracy of the U.S. atomic war planners, saying that although the United States "uses the word 'defense', it is very clear to everyone with a clever mind: nuclear weapons can only be offensive weapons, they cannot be used for defense."

The U.S. aggressive bloc also wants to use the deceptive means of assisting Asian countries in the peaceful use of atomic energy to divert the attention of the people of Asian and African countries from its intensified preparations for atomic war conspiracy. But this trick is also futile. When the U.S. ruling group is sparing no effort to prepare for atomic war, how can they make the people of Asian and African countries believe that the United States sincerely helps them develop the peaceful use of atomic energy? The Syrian representative said at the Ninth United Nations General Assembly: "When human life itself is threatened by atomic destruction, it is still in vain to dream of a better, more comfortable, perhaps more luxurious life, or to dream of conquering cancer." The people of Asian and African countries see very clearly that the U.S. proposal to assist foreign countries in the peaceful use of atomic energy is just an attempt to use this plan to plunder the atomic raw materials of Asian and African countries and make them subordinate to the U.S. purpose of preparing for atomic war.

No intimidation, blackmail, or deception can change the will of billions of Asian and African people to oppose atomic war; the call for the movement of Asian and African people to demand the prohibition of atomic weapons is rising. The people of Asia and Africa and all peace-loving people around the world must unite and fight to the end for the noble cause of realizing the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and all weapons of mass destruction.

    亚非人民坚决反对原子战争
    孟宪谟
    亚洲和非洲人民正在热烈响应世界和平理事会常务委员会的号召，日益广泛和深入地展开反对使用原子武器的签名运动。
    中国人民在这次签名运动中再一次表示了他们反对原子战争的坚决意志，在不到两个月的时间内，已经有四亿多人在世界和平理事会常务委员会的
  “告全世界人民书”上签了名。签名运动也热烈地在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国和越南民主共和国中展开。这些国家的人民强烈反对原子狂人破坏各国人民和平生活的阴谋。曾经三次蒙受原子武器灾害的日本人民，不屈不挠地进行反对原子战争的斗争。截至今年三月十七日为止，日本全国签名要求禁止原子弹和氢弹的已有二千三百多万人。印度人民在三月六日举行了全国性的“停止准备原子战争日”，许多著名的社会人士和政界人士都在反对原子战争的呼吁书上签了名。印度尼西亚、缅甸以及其他亚洲和非洲国家的人民也纷纷展开了征集要求禁止原子武器签名的运动。世界和平理事会已收到了从非洲刚果、塞内加尔、罗得西亚寄去的第一批反对使用原子武器的签名册，上面写满了名字和盖满了指印。
    最近在新德里举行的亚洲国家会议通过决议，要求禁止使用和试验大规模屠杀的武器，并销毁现有的储存，把同样的物资用于建设性的和和平的发展，并建议全亚洲把一九五五年八月六日，即广岛被炸十周年，作为抗议使用原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的日子来纪念。亚洲国家会议的这个决议，反映了亚洲各国人民反对原子战争的共同意志。
    亚非人民目前如此广泛而深入地展开反对原子战争的群众运动，并不是偶然的。亚非人民曾长期遭受帝国主义的奴役和压迫，不止一次地成为帝国主义发动侵略战争的牺牲品；同时，亚洲人民清楚地记得，第一颗原子弹是落在亚洲的土地上，第一个死在氢弹试验下的是亚洲人。因此，亚非各国人民都迫切地希望过和平、独立和自由的生活，坚决反对帝国主义企图增加在他们头上的战争灾祸，特别是原子战争的灾祸。
    第二次世界大战以后，亚非人民就一直在进行着保卫和平反对原子战争的斗争。日本人民很早就喊出了“不许广岛悲剧重演”的口号，这个正义的呼声受到所有亚洲和非洲人民的同情和支持。一九五○年三月，世界保卫和平大会常设委员会通过了斯德哥尔摩宣言，这一宣言立刻获得亚非各国人民的热烈拥护，他们曾为这一宣言展开了大规模的签名运动。一九五二年十月在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议上，亚非各国的代表一致发出了要求“禁止使用原子、细菌和化学武器及其他大规模屠杀武器”的呼声。
      一九五四年三月美国不顾太平洋地区国家人民的安全，在比基尼进行氢弹试验，结果对日本人民造成了严重的灾害。这一事件引起了日本人民极大的愤怒，他们同声斥责和抗议美国的死亡试验，并
  展开了签名运动，要求禁止使用和试验原子弹和氢
  弹。在舆论的影响下，日本国会两院以及地方议会
  也都通过了要求禁止原子武器的决议。
      日本人民的正义斗争得到了亚非各国各阶层人
  士的广泛同情和支持。各国政界领袖提出了关于禁
  止原子武器的建议。印度总理尼赫鲁去年四月二日
  在人民院曾就原子武器发表声明说：“全世界——
  特别是各国人民——对于这些武器及其恐怖的后果怀有深切而普遍的不安。”他并且指出：“仅仅感到不安当然是不够的，必须采取坚决的措施，以防止灾祸。”南亚五国总理去年十二月在茂物举行会议后发表的公报，声明“他们严重关切为试验目的而进行的核子武器和热核子武器爆炸（这种爆炸不仅威胁到他们的国家而且威胁到全世界）的毁坏性的潜力，以及它们的长远的和尚未确定的后果……”
    亚非人民和全世界爱好和平人民要求禁止原子武器的强大运动，曾迫使美国帝国主义者不敢在朝鲜战争和印度支那战争中使用原子武器。但是，美国侵略集团为了实现它夺取世界霸权和奴役全人类的狂妄目的，不但没有放弃它在全世界挑起一次原子战争的疯狂计划，并且正在变本加厉地进行准备原子战争的活动。在欧洲，北大西洋侵略集团通过了在战争中使用原子武器的决定，并且准备把原子武器交给西德军国主义者。在亚洲，美国的负责官员也一再宣布美国在远东的军事战略以把原子弹当作常规武器的观念为基础，并且威胁着要对中国人民和其他爱好和平国家人民使用原子武器。美国侵略集团的这种做法，大大增加了发生原子战争的危险，严重地威胁着世界的和平和安全。
    美国侵略集团这种严重危害和平的活动，引起了亚洲和非洲人民的愤慨和反对。为了缓和亚非各国人民反对原子战争的情绪，美国侵略集团企图用欺骗宣传来迷惑舆论。像杜勒斯这样的原子狂人，也出来散播什么原子武器只用于防御目的以及只在战略上使用原子武器等的论调；他们甚至把大规模屠杀人类的原子武器说成是最人道的武器。但是这种论调是骗不了人的。印度国会议员萨希布·辛格·索克就曾指斥美国原子战争策划者的阴谋说：美国
  “虽然使用了‘防御’这个字眼，但是对于每个头脑聪明的人来说，这是十分明显的：核子武器只能够是进攻性的武器，它是不能作为防御之用的。”
    美国侵略集团还想用援助亚洲国家发展原子能和平利用的欺骗手段，来转移亚非各国人民对它加紧准备原子战争阴谋的注意。但是这种诡计也是枉费心机的。当美国统治集团不遗余力地进行准备原子战争的时候，他们怎么可能使亚非各国人民相信美国真心帮助他们发展原子能的和平利用呢？叙利亚的代表在第九届联合国大会上就说过：“当人类生命本身受到原子毁灭的威胁时，梦想一个更好的、更安适的，也许更奢侈的生活，或梦想征服癌症，这仍然是徒劳无功的。”亚非各国人民看得很清楚，美国提出所谓援助外国发展原子能的和平利用，不过是想利用这个计划来掠夺亚非各国的原子原料，使它们服从于美国准备原子战争的目的。
    任何恫吓、讹诈，或者欺骗手段，都不能够改变十数亿亚非人民反对原子战争的意志；亚非人民要求禁止原子武器的运动的呼声正在日益高涨。亚非人民以及全世界爱好和平人民一定要团结起来，为实现禁止原子武器、氢武器以及一切大规模毁灭性的武器的崇高事业而斗争到底。
