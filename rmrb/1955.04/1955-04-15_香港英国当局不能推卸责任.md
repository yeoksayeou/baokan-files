The British Authorities in Hong Kong Cannot Shirk Their Responsibility
Jiang Yuanchun

Regarding the incident in Hong Kong where US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents sabotaged the Indian aircraft carrying staff members of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference, the Chinese government, in its statement issued on the 12th, demanded that the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong thoroughly investigate the matter and arrest and bring to justice the special agents involved in this murder, to clarify responsibility. However, indications show that the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong have not seriously and thoroughly investigated this incident, but instead are attempting to shirk their responsibility. This situation is clearly unsatisfactory.

The British authorities in Hong Kong bear a serious responsibility for this unprecedented political conspiracy. The day before the incident, the Chinese government had already issued a warning, pointing out that US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents in Hong Kong were plotting to sabotage the Indian aircraft. A British Foreign Office spokesman admitted on the 13th that the Chinese government's "warning was timely enough to take measures to prevent any sabotage." However, the British authorities in Hong Kong did not take strict and effective measures in all aspects. Even the US news agency, United Press, saw a loophole. A United Press Hong Kong dispatch on the 12th pointed out that some of the people working at Kai Tak Airport belonged to so-called "anti-communist" trade unions controlled by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents. This is just one loophole, and there must be many others.

After the incident occurred, people did not see the British authorities in Hong Kong doing anything to strictly investigate this murder case, but instead saw some incomprehensibly contradictory news, seemingly to indicate that the plane crash was not due to the sabotage of US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents, but due to the Indian aircraft's own malfunctions. After the three Indian crew members on the plane were rescued by the British warship "Dampier," a spokesman for the British Navy in Singapore said that the three survivors had not yet recovered from the shock, so "it is not appropriate to make statements about the plane crash at this time." The spokesman also said that it "might be unwise" if they were interviewed by reporters as soon as they arrived in Singapore. According to United Press, this was because China had made accusations of sabotage. However, at the same time, Reuters reported from Singapore what was said to be the words of the ground mechanic Kanik, who was rescued, saying that the plane crash was due to mechanical failure. This Reuters news was then repeatedly publicized by the British propaganda apparatus. The British side said on the one hand that the rescued people were not yet suitable to make statements, but on the other hand repeatedly publicized the statements supposedly made by them, attempting to make people believe that the plane crash was due to mechanical failure. What is the reason for such self-contradiction?

The United States attributed the plane crash to mechanical failure. The United States Information Service and the Associated Press have tried their best to prove that this plane was already "unfit to fly" when it flew from Bombay to Hong Kong. The US State Department even immediately used the materials they provided to deny American guilt and attempted to shift the blame to India, provoking relations between China and India. Does Britain also harbor the same intentions as the United States?

The myth that the plane crash was due to mechanical failure has been refuted by the responsible personnel of the Indian Airlines Company in Bombay and Hong Kong. They believe that saying the Indian aircraft was "unfit to fly" is "nonsense." The manager of the company's Hong Kong branch also said that the fact that the plane flew from Bombay to Hong Kong "is inconsistent with the claim that there was a mechanical problem."

According to Agence France-Presse, after the claim that the plane crash was due to mechanical failure was spread in Singapore, the fear of Chiang Kai-shek's special agents in Hong Kong "quickly disappeared." It can be seen from this that the current evasive attitude of the British authorities in Hong Kong has comforted the murderers.

Hong Kong has become a major base for US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents to create tensions and international disputes. The British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong cannot be indifferent to this situation. They cannot shirk their responsibility for this plane crash incident. They must thoroughly investigate this incident and arrest and bring to justice the US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents involved in this conspiracy.

    香港英国当局不能推卸责任
    蒋元椿
    关于香港美蒋特务破坏我国出席亚非会议代表团工作人员乘坐的印度飞机的事件，我国政府在十二日发表的声明中曾要求英国政府和香港英国当局予以彻底查究，将参与这一谋杀事件的特务分子逮捕法办，以明责任。但是迹象表明，英国政府和香港英国当局并没有认真彻底查究这一事件，反而企图推卸自己的责任。这种情形显然不能令人满意。
    香港英国当局对于这一空前的政治阴谋事件是负有严重的责任的。在出事以前一天，我国政府就已经提出警告，指出香港的美蒋特务有破坏印度飞机的阴谋。英国外交部发言人在十三日承认，我国政府“警告的提出的时间是及时的，足以采取措施来预防任何破坏”。但是香港英国当局却没有在各方面采取严格的、有效的措施。就是美国的合众社也看出了一个漏洞。合众社香港十二日电指出，在启德机场工作的人有一部分是属于蒋介石特务分子控制的所谓“反共”的工会。这仅仅是一个漏洞而已，其他漏洞一定还很多。
    在事件发生以后，人们没有看见香港英国当局做什么事情来严格追究这件谋杀案，却看到一些不可理解地矛盾的消息，似乎要说明飞机失事并不是由于美蒋特务的破坏，而是由于印度飞机本身的故障。在飞机上的三名印度乘务人员被英国军舰
  “丹皮尔号”救起以后，新加坡英国海军的发言人说，这三名生还者仍然没有从震荡中恢复过来，因此“目前不宜就飞机坠毁事件发表谈话”。发言人并说，如果在他们一到新加坡以后就受到记者的访问“可能是不智的”。据合众社说，这是由于中国提出了破坏的控诉的缘故。但是同时，路透社却从新加坡报道了据说是被救起的地勤机械师卡尼克说的话，说飞机失事是由于机件故障。路透社这个消息随即被英国的宣传机关反复地加以宣传。英国方面一面说被救起的人还不宜发表谈话，一面却反复宣传据说是他们发表的谈话，企图使人相信飞机失事是由于机件故障。这样自相矛盾的原因是什么呢？
    美国是把飞机失事归因于机件发生故障的。美国新闻处和美联社都竭力想证明这架飞机在从孟买飞来香港时就已经“不宜于飞行”。美国国务院而且立刻利用它们提供的材料来否认美国的罪行，并企图把责任推在印度身上，挑拨中国和印度的关系。难道英国也怀有像美国一样的打算吗？
    所谓飞机失事是由于机件故障的神话，已经被孟买和香港的印度航空公司的负责人员所驳斥。他们认为说印度这架飞机“不宜于飞行”是“胡说八道”。这个公司的香港分公司经理还说，这架飞机从孟买飞到香港这个事实“同机件有毛病的说法是不相符的”。
    据法新社报道，在新加坡方面传出所谓飞机失事是由于机件故障的说法以后，在香港的蒋介石特务分子的恐惧就“迅即消失”。由此可见，香港英国当局目前的闪避态度已经使杀人犯得到了安慰。
    香港已经成为美蒋特务制造紧张局势和国际纠纷的大本营，英国政府和香港英国当局对于这种情况不能漠不关心。它们对于这次飞机失事事件所负的责任是不容许推卸的。它们必须对这一事件查究到底，将参与这一阴谋的美蒋特务分子逮捕法办。
