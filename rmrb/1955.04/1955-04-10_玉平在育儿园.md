    Yu Ping in Kindergarten

    On March 29th, the July 1st Kindergarten in the western suburbs of Beijing received a child covered in dirt, and that was Yu Ping, who had been cruelly abused by the Ming Dejun couple.

    When comrades from the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region Political Department sent her here, she carefully pleaded with the nanny, "If my father and mother come looking for me, please take me to the mountains."

    Hundreds of thousands of people, thinking of this innocent child's tragic experience, felt pain in their hearts. Now, she is enjoying the happiness and warmth of the world.

    On the morning of April 5th, I came to the July 1st Kindergarten to see how Yu Ping was doing. The person in charge of the kindergarten accompanied me into a sports field, where the children were divided into two rows facing each other, each smiling and preparing for a fun game. The person in charge called out loudly, "Is Yu Ping here?" When the children heard someone asking about Yu Ping, they happily looked at Yu Ping and said, "Yu Ping, your father is here, your father is here!" As soon as little Yu Ping heard the word "father," she was immediately frightened and burrowed into the crowd. Knowing that the child must have been startled, I quickened my pace, went up to her, took her little hand and said, "Good child, don't be afraid! It's uncle coming to see you, not your father." Only then did Yu Ping timidly stand up. I held her hand, touched her head, and gave her candy and toys. Only then did Yu Ping crack a small smile.

    The person in charge of the kindergarten told me that when Yu Ping first arrived, she was dirty and smelly from head to toe. The nannies washed her hair and gave her a bath, took off her dirty clothes, and braided her hair. The nannies even took out their own money to buy her new socks. Yu Ping walked to the mirror, looked at the little Yu Ping in the mirror, and couldn't help but smile innocently. The nannies picked up the People's Daily of March 27th and read to her the report exposing the abuse of children by the Ming Dejun couple. Yu Ping started crying "wah" before she finished listening. The nannies said, "The nannies and the children all like you. Don't cry, no one will hit you anymore." Yu Ping wiped away her tears, a smile hanging on her lips, as if she realized that her life was guaranteed.

    The first night, a nanny named Song helped her take off her clothes, only to see patches of scars on her delicate skin. Yu Ping pointed to the injured areas with her little fingers and said, "This was burned by Daddy with iron chopsticks (used on the stove), this was pinched by Mommy, this is..." Auntie Song stroked her scars, her eyes filled with tears, and she couldn't say anything more to Yu Ping.

    Yu Ping is impatient and appears somewhat timid and fearful towards people. She often wakes up startled while sleeping. In Yu Ping's dormitory, when someone asks, "How did your father beat you?" she immediately crawls under the bed, imitating the way she was brutally beaten. Indeed, under the cruel abuse of the Ming Dejun couple, Yu Ping's pure heart has been greatly damaged.

    Yu Ping has learned to dress, fold her quilt, wash her face, sing, and play games since coming to the kindergarten. She has become an innocent, lively, and lovely child. Tang Jun

    玉平在育儿园
    三月二十九日，北京西郊的七一育儿园来了一个混身肮脏的孩子，她就是被名德俊夫妇残酷虐待的玉平。
    当华北军区后勤政治部的同志送她到这里时，她小心地恳求阿姨说：“如果我的爸爸妈妈找来了，你把我带到山上去。”
    成千上万的人想到这个无辜的孩子的悲惨遭遇，心里都是难受的。现在，她享受到了人间的幸福和温暖。
    四月五日的上午，我来到七一育儿园，看看玉平的生活情况。育儿园的负责人陪同我走进了一个运动场，孩子们面对面地分做两排，一个个笑嘻嘻地准备着做一个有趣的游戏。这位负责同志大声叫道：“玉平在这儿吗？”孩子们听到有人问玉平，就高兴地望着玉平说：“玉平，你爸爸来了，你爸爸来了！”小玉平一听说“爸爸”两个字，立即吓得往人丛中乱钻，我知道孩子准是受惊了，就放快脚步走上去拉着她的小手说：“好孩子：你不要怕呀！是叔叔看你来了，不是爸爸。”玉平这才胆怯地站起来。我拉拉她的手，摸摸她的头，并送给她糖果和玩具，玉平这才裂开小嘴嘻嘻地笑了。
    育儿园的负责人告诉我：玉平刚来的时候，从头到脚都脏的发臭了。阿姨们替她洗了头，也洗了澡，脱去了肮脏的衣服，扎起了小辫子。阿姨们又自己拿出钱来替她买了新的袜子。玉平走到镜子的面前，看看镜子里面的小玉平，不禁天真地笑了。阿姨们拿起三月二十七日的人民日报，把报纸上揭发名德俊夫妇虐待孩子的事情念给她听，玉平没有听完就“哇”地哭起来了。阿姨们说：“阿姨和小朋友们都是喜欢你的，不要哭了，以后再没有人打你了。”玉平揩干了眼泪，嘴唇边挂上了笑意，似乎体会到生命有了保障。
    第一天晚上，一个姓宋的阿姨替她脱掉衣服，只见她那娇嫩的皮肤上露出了一块块的伤疤。玉平用她的小手指着受伤的地方说：“这是爸爸用铁筷子（火炉上用的）烫的，这是妈妈掐的，这是……。”宋阿姨抚摸着她的伤痕，眼眶里含满了泪水，再也不能和玉平说下去了。
    玉平性情急躁，对人显得有些畏缩、胆怯，在睡觉时常常一惊就醒。在玉平的宿舍里，有人问“你爸爸怎样打你的？”她立即就钻到床底下去，装出当时被毒打的样子。确实，玉平在名德俊夫妇毒手虐待下，她的纯洁的心灵已经遭到很大的摧残。
    玉平来到育儿园已经学会了穿衣、叠被、洗脸，也学会了唱歌和游戏，她已经变成一个天真活泼可爱的孩子了。　唐军
