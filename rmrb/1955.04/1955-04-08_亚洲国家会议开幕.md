Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 7th. The Asian Countries Conference opened at 6:00 PM on April 6th at the Constitution Club in New Delhi. The flags of sixteen Asian and Arab countries were displayed on both sides of the rostrum. On the rostrum, a large, deep blue curtain was inscribed with "Asian Countries Conference," and adorned with floral patterns and doves.

According to the conference secretariat, 188 delegates attended the opening meeting, including representatives from Ceylon, the People's Republic of China, India, Japan, Jordan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Lebanon, Mongolia, Pakistan, Syria, the Soviet Union, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Burmese delegation is expected to arrive on the 7th. Approximately three thousand citizens from all walks of life in Delhi attended the opening ceremony.

The conference elected Mrs. Rameshwari Nehru, the Indian representative, as chair of the opening meeting. The conference also approved the list of the presidium of the Asian Countries Conference. The delegates responded with prolonged cheers when the presidium took their seats, and presented wreaths to the members of the presidium.

Chairman of the Asian Countries Conference Reception Committee, Agarwal, delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting. He said that because Asian countries are engaged in peaceful construction, peace is their greatest need. He pointed out the new dangers currently facing Asia are the military alliances being formed under the patronage of some Western countries. He said that this conference will map out specific steps so that the people of Asia and the world can understand and appreciate the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, so that these principles can form a solid foundation for peace and security.

Mrs. Rameshwari Nehru then addressed the meeting. She said that Asian countries have a common destiny. We are linked by the common desire to build our countries, safeguard our freedom, and fulfill the task of realizing world peace.

In her speech, Mrs. Nehru praised the joint statement of the Prime Ministers of China and India. She said that this statement presents the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence to the world as a good remedy for eliminating the existing and escalating world tensions. She said that we Asians need peace more than anyone else. Most of us are just beginning to rebuild our countries. We are slowly laying the foundation for a new life with labor and hard work. Therefore, peace is as necessary to the lives of our people as food and water are to a person's life. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence point out the path to maintaining peace. Many Asian countries have accepted these principles. I hope that everyone, whether participating or not, will unconditionally support the adoption of these principles.

Mrs. Nehru said that everyone enjoys equal opportunities, regardless of their race, color, identity, and status. She said that all forms of colonialism—open or covert—must be banished. She said that we must safeguard peaceful development and oppose all military treaties and arrangements. War and the roots of war should be eliminated from human and national life.

Mrs. Nehru said that Asian countries should develop their industrial and agricultural production and expand trade between them for the benefit of all. She said that our countries should not seek assistance from the West, but should cooperate with each other and fight against backwardness. Our conference is not against any country or anyone. We only hope to develop more friendly cooperation with our neighbors. She said: We hope to expand the area of peace. The larger this area, the greater its benefits to humanity.

Mrs. Nehru condemned the use of atomic and nuclear weapons. She said that the people of all countries around the world must work together to ban the use of all nuclear weapons. Nuclear energy—if produced—should only be used for industrial and production purposes.

The head of the Japanese delegation, Jiichiro Matsumoto, then spoke, saying that the task facing the Asian Countries Conference is to discuss the liberation and independence of the peoples of Asian countries and to seek world peace. He assured that the Japanese people will do their best to achieve the goals of the conference.

The head of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Nguyen Van Huong, said that this conference is "a good opportunity for the people of Asia to promote mutual understanding and solidarity." He said that the Vietnamese people are busy restoring their war-torn country, engaging in the peaceful construction of the country, and preparing for the general election scheduled for July 1956. The Vietnamese people know very well that only in a peaceful environment can their ideals of a free and happy life be realized. Therefore, the peace-loving Vietnamese people wholeheartedly support this conference and agree with its agenda.

The special guest representative of the conference, former French Minister René Capitant, praised the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in his speech. He said that these principles have received enthusiastic support from the people of the world.

The head of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Park Jung-ai, said that the common desire of the people of Asian countries is to obtain or maintain their national independence and freedom, and to establish lasting peace in Asia.

Park Jung-ai said that the Korean people warmly welcome the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, believing that the five principles are a solid foundation for eliminating the danger of war in Asia, easing tensions, and establishing peaceful cooperation and unity among the people of all countries resisting foreign aggression. She said that the peace-loving Korean people enthusiastically support the Asian Countries Conference because they firmly believe that exchanging views on the common issues of all Asian people at this conference will greatly help promote mutual understanding and unity among the Asian people, and help establish lasting peace in Asia.

Chairman of the East Pakistan People's Muslim League and Pakistani representative attending the conference, Bhashani, said that imperialists are using the banner of suppressing Asian communism to suppress the people of Asian countries. He expressed his belief that the people of Asia will be able to shatter the imperialists' conspiracy to continue enslaving the people of Asia.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Nikolai Tikhonov, said that the Soviet people will do everything possible to defend peace and promote friendship between countries. He spoke about the great role played by Asian countries in helping the Geneva Conference ensure peace. He said: "China played no small role in making the Geneva Conference a success." "But unfortunately, the United Nations has not recognized this great country—this practice is greatly hindering the cause of peace." Tikhonov said that kind people cannot help but rejoice at seeing the victory of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence—these principles should become a solid foundation for establishing normal international relations and further promoting friendly ties between countries.

Cambodian representative Chiya Silaro Bhikkhu said that no Cambodian citizen approves of extreme policies. They want the principles of peaceful coexistence.

The head of the Syrian delegation, Dr. Dawalibi, said that this conference is a noble idea to bring Asian countries together to ensure peace and security. He expressed the hope that this conference and the upcoming Asian-African Conference can map out specific ways for mutual cooperation.

The head of the Chinese delegation, Guo Moruo, said that the gathering of representatives of Asian countries in New Delhi symbolizes the friendship and unity of the Asian people. It in itself demonstrates our common desire to strive for peace and our common will to defend peace.

Guo Moruo said that the Asian people have learned from experience that colonial countries have only given them war and enslavement. They are determined to end this dark period in history. They are united in fighting to improve their living conditions. He pointed out that today, the threat of war is still before us, and colonial policies are still being implemented, all of which hinder Asian countries from moving towards independence and freedom, and make peaceful construction for the purpose of improving lives impossible. This is why our peace-loving people of all countries are asking us to attend this conference.

Guo Moruo said that the agenda of the Asian Countries Conference will enable delegates from various countries to enhance their understanding of each other and strengthen their unity, so as to find a way to ease the international situation and save Asian peace in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Our unity will be a huge force for defending peace. We will surely defeat war. Peace will surely triumph.

The head of the Mongolian delegation, Yagvaral Nym, said that he is convinced that due to the common desire of the representatives of the people of various Asian countries attending the conference to achieve peace and unity, despite their differences in ideology and other aspects, they will be able to reach a complete understanding and make a great contribution to eliminating the threat of war.

At the end of the speech, Park Jung-ai, on behalf of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace, presented a flag to the Asian Countries Conference.

    尼赫鲁夫人说，一切人都享有平等的机会，不管他们的种族、肤色、身份和地位。她说，一切形式的殖民制度——公开的或隐蔽的——必须滚蛋。她说，我们必须维护和平发展，并且反对一切军事条约和安排。应该从人类和国家生活中消除战争和战争的根源。
    尼赫鲁夫人说，亚洲国家应该发展它们的工业和农业生产，并且扩大它们之间的贸易，以有利于大家。她说，我们各国不应该向西方寻求援助，而应该互相合作，和落后的情况进行斗争。我们的会议并不是反对任何国家或任何人。我们只是希望发展同我们近邻的更友好的合作。她说：我们希望扩大和平地区。这个地区越大，它对人类的好处就越大。
    尼赫鲁夫人斥责使用原子武器和核子武器的行为。她说，全世界一切国家的人民必须共同努力来禁止使用一切核子武器。核子能——如果生产了的话——只可用于工业和生产方面。

    会议的特邀代表、法国前部长雷纳·加比唐在他的发言中称赞和平共处的五项原则。他说，这些原则已获得全世界人民的热烈支持。

    郭沫若说，亚洲国家会议的议程将使各国代表能够增进彼此的了解和加强他们的团结，从而找出某种方法来缓和国际局势，并且根据和平共处的五项原则来拯救亚洲和平。我们的团结将是保卫和平的巨大力量。我们一定会战胜战争。和平一定会胜利。
    蒙古代表团团长雅格瓦拉尔·尼姆说，他确信，由于出席会议的各个亚洲国家的人民的代表具有实现和平和团结的共同愿望，尽管他们在观念形态方面和其他方面有分歧，他们将能达成完全的谅解，并对消除战争威胁作出巨大的贡献。
