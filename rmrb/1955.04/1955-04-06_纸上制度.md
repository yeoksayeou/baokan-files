　　Paper System
　　Yao Shuangchuan
　　On October 3, 1954, Wang Eryin, a worker from the loading team of the Sales Department of the Yangquan Mining Bureau's No. 3 Mine, failed to properly close the switch when closing the coal chute, burning out a 20-horsepower electric motor. Transportation was halted for three hours. The next day, the responsible cadres from the mine's Inspection Section, Sales Department, Electromechanical Section, and Security Section held an accident investigation meeting. Everyone unanimously agreed that the cause of the accident was: "Workers' technical skills are not proficient, the machine is not operated by a dedicated person, violating the 'three dedicated' system of dedicated person, dedicated responsibility, and dedicated machine." At the same time, based on the cause of the accident, improvement measures were proposed: "Section Chief Jia Weihua of the Sales Department is responsible for suggesting to the mine manager that the 'three dedicated' system must be implemented and that technical education for workers be strengthened." After this decision, the meeting ended.

　　On January 11th of this year, when loading worker Bai Xiushan went to close the coal chute, he again failed to properly close the switch, burning out a 15-horsepower electric motor, and causing the electric wire to spark, burning more than six meters of cable, again halting transportation for three hours.

　　The repeated occurrence of accidents of the same nature did not attract serious attention from the cadres. After the accident, as usual, the responsible cadres from the Inspection Section, Sales Department, Electromechanical Section, and Security Section conducted an investigation. Everyone similarly believed that the cause of the accident was: "Workers' technical skills are not proficient, the machine is not operated by a dedicated person, violating the 'three dedicated' system of dedicated person, dedicated responsibility, and dedicated machine." At the same time, improvement measures were again proposed: "Section Chief Jia Weihua of the Sales Department is responsible for suggesting to the mine manager that the 'three dedicated' system must be implemented and that the technical education of workers be strengthened." After this decision, the meeting adjourned again.

　　On February 10th, during the early shift, loading worker Chen Shuchang used a shovel to touch the switch of the third coal chute, resulting in a short circuit. Not only was a switch burned out and the electric wire sparked, but a wooden house was also burned down, affecting transportation for one hour and fifty minutes. Chen Shuchang was nearly electrocuted and killed.

　　Only after this accident did the leading cadres of the relevant units feel the seriousness of the situation. Section Chief Jia Weihua of the Sales Department, Section Chief Shi Sanhai of the Inspection Section, Deputy Section Chief Wang Dengxiang of the Electromechanical Section, and two responsible comrades from the Security Section held another meeting to investigate the accident. Everyone unanimously agreed that the main cause of the accident was still "failure to follow operating procedures, the machine not operated by a dedicated person, violating the 'three dedicated' system of dedicated person, dedicated responsibility, and dedicated machine."

　　However, in more than four months, accidents violating the "three dedicated" system had occurred three times. What was the reason for this? To this end, Inspection Section Chief Shi Sanhai and Sales Department Chief Jia Weihua argued for more than two hours at the meeting. Section Chief Shi, holding the "Emergency Instructions for Production Work" issued by the mine manager's office in January, questioned: "The instructions clearly stipulate that the system of dedicated person, dedicated responsibility, and dedicated machine must be adhered to. Why haven't you implemented this system?" Section Chief Jia also said angrily: "The mine manager doesn't provide personnel, and loading workers have to operate the machines in their place. How can there not be problems?" Section Chief Shi said: "No matter what, you should adhere to the principle of safe coal mine production." Section Chief Jia said: "Then I can only stop the machines." After arguing back and forth, they finally decided: the three section chiefs, Jia, Shi, and Wang, would suggest to the mine manager that the "three dedicated" system be implemented and that the technical education of workers be strengthened. Only then did the meeting end.

　　Now, more than a month has passed, the "three dedicated" system has still not been implemented, technical education has not been strengthened, and the five machines continue to experience major and minor accidents. What is the reason for this?

　　The five machines in the South Yard of the Yangquan Mining Bureau's No. 3 Mine are all operated by loading workers. They have not learned the techniques of operating coal chute machines and must also do other work. This is the direct cause of the accidents. The three accident investigation meetings also made "prescriptive" resolutions, but why have they not solved the problem?

　　It turns out that Section Chief Jia Weihua of the Sales Department had also, according to the resolution of the accident investigation meeting, suggested to the mine manager that the "three dedicated" system be implemented. The mine manager instructed Section Chief Jia to take responsibility for solving this problem. Section Chief Jia emphasized that he did not understand the technology and complained that the mine manager was not solving the problem. Therefore, he did not actively think of ways to solve it, and the first part of the resolution fell through. The second part of the resolution was to strengthen the technical education of the workers. It was originally decided that the Sales Department would organize workers who operated the coal chute machines to participate in technical learning in the Electromechanical Section. This was not a difficult technical task, but for some reason, Section Chief Jia did not organize the workers to participate in the learning. Therefore, the entire resolution also fell through.

　　Strangely, the section chiefs repeatedly held the same meetings, made the same analyses, and made the same resolutions, but did not study why their analyses and resolutions did not help to eliminate accidents, as if their responsibility was only to pass resolutions.

　　Strangely, after the mine manager instructed Jia Weihua to solve the problem of the "three dedicated" system, he no longer inquired about it, as if after issuing the instruction, the problem would solve itself.

　　Recently, Section Chief Jia Weihua has left production for study. Although, after the workers' requests and urging, the Sales Department organized five or six workers operating coal chute machines to participate in technical learning in the Electromechanical Section a week ago, the most important key problem has not been fundamentally solved, and the loading workers' wages are still paid from the loading fees. When exactly will the "three dedicated" system be implemented? Mine manager and leading comrades of the Sales Department, please answer this question.

    纸上制度
　　姚双传
    一九五四年十月三日，阳泉矿务局三矿营业科装车队工人王二银去关煤溜子时，没有合严开关，烧坏了一部二十马力的电动机。运输停止了三小时。第二天，矿上的检查科、营业科、机电科、保卫科的负责干部，召开了事故追查会议，大家一致认为发生事故的原因是：“工人技术不熟练，机器没有专人掌握，违反专人、专责、专机器的三专制度。”同时根据发生事故的原因提出了改进的措施：“由营业科的贾维华科长负责向矿长建议，必须按三专制度办事，并加强对工人进行技术教育。”这样决定后，这个会议就结束了。
    到了今年一月十一日，装车工人白秀山去关煤溜子时，又没有合严开关，烧坏了一部十五马力的电动机，而且引起电线冒火，烧坏电缆线六公尺多，又停止运输三小时。
    同样性质的事故一再发生，并没有引起干部们的认真注意。事故发生后，照例由检查科、营业科、机电科、保卫科的负责干部进行了追查，大家同样认为事故发生的原因是：“工人技术不熟练，机器没有专人掌握，违反专人、专责、专机器的三专制度。”同时又提出了改进措施：“由营业科贾维华科长负责向矿长建议，必须按三专制度办事，并加强工人的技术教育。”这样决定后又散会了。
    二月十日早班装车工人陈树昌用铁锹去触动第三部煤溜子的开闭器时，发生连电事故，不但烧坏一部开闭器，引起电线冒火，而且烧毁一间木房，影响运输一小时五十分，陈树昌因触电倒地险些发生触电死亡事故。
    这次事故发生后，各有关单位的领导干部才感到事态严重。营业科的贾维华科长，检查科的史三孩科长，机电科的王登祥副科长和保卫科的两个负责同志又开会进行了事故追查。一致认为发生事故的主要原因，仍然是“不按操作规程办事，机器没有专人掌握，违反专人、专责、专机器的三专制度。”
    但是四个多月中，违反“三专制度”的事故却发生了三次，这是什么原因呢？为此，检查科长史三孩和营业科长贾维华在会上争吵了两个多小时，史科长拿着元月份矿长室发下来的“生产工作紧急指示”质问道：“指示上明明白白规定要坚持专人、专责、专机器。这个制度你为什么不执行？”贾科长也怒气冲冲地说：“矿长不给人，装车工来代开机器，怎么能不出毛病？”史科长说：“不管怎么，你应该坚持煤矿安全生产的原则。”贾科长说：“那我只能把机器停了。”吵来吵去，最后决定：由贾、史、王三位科长向矿长建议，执行三专制度，并加强工人的技术教育。这个会议才收了场。
    到现在又是一个多月过去了，“三专制度”还是没有执行，技术教育还是没有加强，五部机器还是不断发生大大小小的事故。这是什么原因呢？
    阳泉矿务局三矿南场的五部机器都由装车工人代开，他们没有学习过操纵溜煤机器的技术，还要兼做别的工作，这是发生事故的直接原因。三次事故追查会议也作了“对症下药”的决议，但为什么并没有解决问题呢？
    原来营业科长贾维华也曾根据事故追查会议的决议，去向矿长建议按“三专制度”办事，矿长指示要贾科长负责来解决这个问题，贾科长强调自己不懂技术，埋怨矿长不解决问题，因而，也不积极想办法，决议的前一部分就落空了。决议的后一部分是加强对工人进行技术教育，原决定由营业科组织代开溜煤机器的工人参加机电科的技术学习，这不是什么技术工作，但不知为什么贾科长也没有去把工人组织起来参加学习。因而全部决议也都落空了。
    奇怪的是，科长们一而再，再而三地开同样的会，作同样的分析，同样的决议，却并不研究为什么他们的分析和决议并不能有助于消灭事故，好像他们的责任只不过是通过决议。
    奇怪的是，矿长指示贾维华解决“三专制度”的问题后，也就此不闻不问了，好像指示一通之后，问题自会解决。
    最近贾维华科长已脱离生产学习去了。虽然经过工人的要求和督促，在一周前营业科才组织了五、六个开溜煤机器的工人参加了机电科的技术学习，不过最重要的关键问题还未根本解决，装车工人工资还在装车费内开支。究竟到什么时候才能按“三专制度”办事呢？矿长和营业科领导同志们，请你们回答这个问题吧。
