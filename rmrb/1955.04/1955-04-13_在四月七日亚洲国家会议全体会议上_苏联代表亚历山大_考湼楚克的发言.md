    We listened with great emotion to the reports of Mr. Anup Singh and Mr. Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation. They gave us a profound analysis of the most important issues in the current situation that are troubling the people of Asian countries today.
    The Soviet delegation expresses its deep gratitude to the representatives who made these speeches.
    We, the Soviet people, believe that the greatest happiness in the world is to enjoy stable peace throughout the world and to maintain goodwill among the people of all countries.
    The Soviet people's hearts are filled with this feeling, because our great motherland has written on its banner the motto of establishing a new and better life completely dedicated to constructive labor, which guarantees the continuous increase of people's happiness, promotes the prosperity of the national cultures of our republics and their fraternal friendship, and increases material and spiritual values in pursuit of a more happy and peaceful life, and seeks world peace and close friendship between all countries.
    N.A. Bulganin, leader of the Soviet government, said at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on February 9, 1955: "The strongest desire of the people of all countries in the world is the desire for peace." "The Soviet government will continue to consistently implement the policy of consolidating peace and universal security, which has proven correct in practice, and the policy of maintaining friendly relations with all countries." The Soviet people's peaceful efforts have received increasing response in the hearts of people all over the world who hate war and the crude "policy of strength" pursued by the American reactionaries. The American reactionaries pursue this policy in order to enslave the people of all countries and serve the interests of Wall Street. In their frantic activities to seize world hegemony, they have tried every possible means to obstruct the prohibition of nuclear weapons, in order to intimidate the people of all countries with atomic bombs, threats, and extortion, and force countries to abandon their national independence. They support governments that obey them, tie the hands of these countries by participating in aggressive blocs, and use them to realize the new malicious intentions of those who vainly attempt to dominate the world.
    This is the reason why the American aggressive bloc and their European friends are desperately trying to undermine all Soviet proposals aimed at banning atomic weapons and effectively supervising this ban. Not long ago, American politicians insisted that the reason why the Soviet government always advocated banning atomic weapons was because the Soviet Union did not yet have these weapons and would not be able to possess them within ten to fifteen years. But this lie has completely fallen through. Today, it is not the Soviet Union but the United States that is lagging behind in the production of hydrogen weapons. However, this situation has not affected the peaceful policy of the Soviet state. The Soviet people are unanimously signing the appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council to destroy stockpiled atomic weapons. The whole world knows that the Soviet Union has proposed to the US government to sign an agreement on not using atomic weapons. In February of this year, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov put forward several new constructive proposals. In his report to the Supreme Soviet, he said: "We suggest that the United States not compete in the production of atomic weapons, but compete in the peaceful use of atomic energy." The world's first atomic energy power plant has already started generating electricity in the Soviet Union. Dear friends, let me tell you that the Soviet Union, based on the principle of broader international cooperation in the peaceful research and use of atomic energy, provides scientific, technical and industrial assistance in these areas to a number of countries. The Soviet Union is now considering providing assistance to other countries. These steps, aimed at increasing the number of countries to which the Soviet Union will provide scientific, technical and industrial assistance in the peaceful use of atomic energy, will undoubtedly be regarded by the people of all countries as a new contribution to the cause of peace and will be warmly welcomed by economically backward countries; these countries, not through their own fault, have so far lacked the necessary equipment and conditions to carry out research in this area in their own way.
    This initiative shows the Soviet Union's strong desire to use the most enormous natural forces for peaceful purposes to benefit the people, and to bring benefit and happiness to all countries.
    This initiative is an important part of the firm principles of the peaceful foreign policy of our government and our people. This is a fact that the supporters of new wars are trying to distort and keep from people's knowledge.
    The highly placed American atomic merchants and their illustrious generals have recently lost not only their sense of reality, but also their common sense. They threaten the Soviet Union, China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the People's Democracies, as well as other countries that will never agree to exchange freedom and independence for dollars and the long-accumulated goods of American monopoly capital, with atomic bombs.
    Certain senators and congressmen have made increasingly inflammatory war speeches. These speeches are intended to intimidate the people of the world, destroy their will to demand peace, and plunge them into the flames of another world war. But what has been the result of the war hysteria that has prevailed in the United States for several years? What has been the result of the atomic diplomacy of "strength"? First of all, it has made the freedom-loving people of the world more closely united in their noble task of fighting for peace; it has exposed the masks of those politicians and statesmen who put the interests of their human blood traffickers above the interests of the nation and the country and signed the infamous aggressive treaties.
    It has opened the eyes of millions of people and made them see who is plotting against mankind. It has made many Americans feel uneasy and shaken their confidence in their future. It is true that the governments of the United States, Britain and France have indeed talked several times about their hope to negotiate on the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. But those members representing the governments of the United States, Britain, France and Canada in the Disarmament Commission Subcommittee of the United Nations passed a resolution at the meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, authorizing the Supreme Command of this group, headed by an American general, to use atomic weapons in future wars. If we also take into account the fact that the United States and its obedient friends did not allow India, China, or Czechoslovakia to participate in the subcommittee, then even a fool who knows nothing about politics can easily understand who, and for what purpose, is setting obstacles on the road to resolving extremely urgent problems that help ease international tensions.
    The Soviet Union has repeatedly suggested taking the first important step, that is, that all countries undertake the solemn obligation not to use atomic weapons.
    Friends, you know that at the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly (last September), the Soviet delegation proposed the conclusion of an international convention stipulating the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons and other types of weapons of mass destruction, the reduction of conventional armaments, and the establishment of international supervision over the observance of this convention. After discussing the Soviet proposal and other proposals, the Disarmament Commission Subcommittee of the United Nations was instructed to take new measures to reach agreement on these major issues. In fact, this decision has been seriously damaged by the Paris Agreement, which aims to intensify the arms race and conduct atomic warfare. What is the value of their verbal talk about peace when American diplomats and the governments of their friends are handing over atomic weapons to Nazi generals, turning Japan into another unsinkable atomic aircraft carrier, and surrounding the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies with new military bases? They have occupied Taiwan, which belongs to China, concluded an indecent treaty with Chiang Kai-shek, and are threatening with atomic weapons 600 million people who have experienced unimaginable suffering, have been subjected to the most severe fetters, and have experienced unprecedented tyranny and misfortune, and whose blood has flowed into rivers due to the "civilized imperialists" and their puppets—the executioners of the Chinese people. When they do this, how much are their sermons about the great family of free nations, about civilization, and about the principles of sublime humanism worth?
    In view of the firm will of the Soviet people and the broad public throughout the world demanding the destruction of stockpiled atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, the Soviet government put forward new proposals on February 18, in addition to its proposals at the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, advocating that all countries undertake the following obligations:
    1. Completely destroy all atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs stockpiled by various countries, and only use fissionable materials for peaceful purposes.
    2. Do not increase the number of their armed forces and the amount of armaments to exceed the level of January 1, 1955, nor increase the appropriations for military aspects in their budgets to exceed the level of the 1955 budget appropriations.
    It is extremely important to establish international supervision over the implementation of these resolutions. The Soviet government recognizes that the people of all countries have a vital interest in solving the problem of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. No country—whether it is a member of the United Nations or not—must be excluded from participating in the work of completing this important and urgent task. The Soviet government believes that it is necessary for the United Nations to convene a world conference on the issue of atomic weapons no later than the end of this year. However, this significant proposal of the Soviet Union has not received the due support among responsible American figures and their North Atlantic Treaty Organization partners.
    The American reactionary group, blinded by their crazy policy of "backing with strength," regards every new constructive proposal put forward by the Soviet Union as a sign of weakness. At the same time, they are constantly bragging about their country's military strength. They added the words "can only be won through strength" to the glorious and great word peace, thus obliterating the essence of the great concept conveyed by the word peace. They call their overseas bases "the greatest tool for retaliation" or "peace backed by strength" or "determination to negotiate backed by strength." This is what diplomats say, and Dulles is far ahead of his companions in this regard. But to some powerful senators in the United States, world peace, even world peace "backed by strength," seems to be an insult. They say that due to the emergence of the atomic bomb, the only possible strategy is the strategy of conducting a preventive war, so they insist on launching a preventive war against the people of the great Soviet Union, China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the People's Democracies.
    We, the Soviet people, understand the difference between the atomic madness of the American war-mongers and the true wishes of the American people and those sober-minded American political and social figures who do not support the "policy of strength" and do not want a shameful atomic war; they cherish the best traditions of their great country as they cherish everything created by the genius of the American people.
    The Soviet people wholeheartedly agree with the excellent words recently spoken by Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in his conversation with American reporters. He said: "The relations between countries should not be based on the 'position of strength' policy, but on the basis of mutual understanding. To this end, it is first necessary to develop normal trade on mutually beneficial terms. To this end, one should not threaten other countries. It is necessary to restrain those madmen who use atomic bombs to scare people. This will bring peace to the people of all countries.
    The Soviet Union is striving to develop normal business and trade relations with other countries in order to consolidate this normal relationship and turn it into a friendly relationship. The Soviet Union has no disputes with the United States. The Soviet people have friendly feelings towards the American people. If the American government wants to get anything from the Soviet Union, then it can be sure that the American government will not get anything by means of extortion and threats. Threats and blackmail will not produce any results, because the Soviet Union has never yielded to threats and will not yield to threats in the future."
    The Soviet people are not afraid of threats. When our country was still the only socialist country in the world, almost everyone threatened us; many people became all kinds of prophets, shouting that this young country was weak and predicted that it would inevitably collapse. But where are these prophets today? Some of them have died of nostalgia and hatred of human melancholy, while others are still singing their new songs with old tunes, but with little strength, their chorus reminds people of those hungry, disheveled birds that flap their wings and croak in the dark in unfamiliar courtyards.
    I think, friends, you all know that the Disarmament Commission Subcommittee of the United Nations recently held a meeting in London. On March 18, the Soviet government proposed the conclusion of an international convention on the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction. The Soviet Union proposed to use the French and British proposal of June 11, 1954 as the basis for this convention. According to the main points of the French and British proposal, the Soviet government proposed that the countries concerned reduce their armaments, military forces and military budgets to half of the standards agreed upon by everyone within six months or twelve months. This reduction should be based on the level of January 1, 1955 as the standard. The Soviet Union proposed that the major powers such as the United States, Britain, France, China, and the Soviet Union substantially reduce their armaments and military forces. When everyone agrees on the standards for reducing armaments and military forces, the geographical, economic and political factors of each country, as well as the number of the population, should be appropriately considered. The Soviet proposal emphasized the implementation of effective international supervision over the fulfillment of the obligations undertaken under this convention, and this supervision should be established from the very beginning.
    The Soviet proposal provided for further measures to be taken after the initial stage of reducing armaments and military personnel, and these measures were aimed at further reducing armaments while taking steps to ban atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.
    However, the representatives of the Western countries in the Disarmament Commission Subcommittee of the United Nations not only avoided considering the main points of the Soviet proposal, but also attempted to replace the issue of the unanimously agreed standards for reducing armaments and military personnel with the issue of the level of armaments and military personnel. They insisted that certain countries have the right to raise the issue of increasing their armaments and military personnel.
    As everyone can see, they are doing exactly as the Russian proverb says, they start by raising a glass to your health, and end up saying, "May your soul rest in peace!"
    As for the proposal to reduce the armaments and military personnel and military budgets of the five major powers by one-third and use this as a unanimously agreed standard, it was resolutely rejected by the Western countries. Similarly, they actually refused to discuss the specific dates for reducing armaments and prohibiting nuclear weapons. But if an agreement that is so important to the fate of the whole world does not even mention the date of its implementation, what is the point of it?
    Therefore, I am reminded of a Ukrainian saying: "Before sunrise, the morning dew can make people catch a cold and die."
    Please allow me to remind everyone: Before the Disarmament Commission Subcommittee of the United Nations began its work, some Western political figures—followed by newspapers—were intent on accelerating the arms race, especially expanding the production of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. In this way, they strangled the idea of prohibiting these weapons before it could be realized. People can know, taking these facts into account, that they still adhere to their original position on this issue.
    Instead of trying to reach an agreement, they used all kinds of old and new means to distract the attention of the people of the world and hide their own aggressive intentions.
    Those who plan "peace backed by strength" have lost their sense of humor and hastily created a new angel of peace named Stassen, who holds the title of Special Assistant to the President on Disarmament Issues. People should praise him, this angel has traveled all over Europe and Asia in recent years, working tirelessly to establish military blocs and organize economic pressure on countries.
    It seems that a bird has changed its feathers and wants to become a peacock, but this is in vain, its voice exposes its essence. Everything is in vain, because what should be changed is not the feathers, but the voice itself, I am referring to the voice of "backed by strength." People should not take evasive attitudes, but should try to reach an agreement through the highest-level negotiations before the countries lose their patience.
    The people of all countries in the world are fully determined to make their struggle to destroy nuclear weapons of mass destruction a successful one, determined to stop the arms race, and strive for lasting international peace, friendship and goodwill.
    My dear friends, let me assure you that even though dark clouds shroud the world, we, the Soviet people, must intensify our efforts to ban weapons of mass destruction and strive for world peace, because we are convinced that the people of all nations have an indomitable desire for peace, and this desire for peace can and will defeat any plan of the war-mongers.
    We hope that the peace-loving countries of Asia will unanimously support the World Peace Council's appeal to the people of the world, and sign this appeal to the people of the world that expresses the wishes of the people of all countries in the world to destroy atomic weapons stockpiled by all countries.
    The conclusion of a treaty between India and China based on the Five Principles has opened up a path for other countries to establish peaceful and friendly relations, and the immeasurable contribution made by these two great countries to the cause of peace has deeply moved the people of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union.
    On behalf of the Soviet people, I express my warmest friendship and deep respect to the great Indian people and the Indian government headed by the wise politician Nehru. I am also very happy to tell you, my dear friends, that your country and all countries in Asia will always feel that the Soviet people are the most sincere and selfless friends. For the Soviet people, the most important thing is the happiness and prosperity, freedom and national independence of all countries, brotherly mutual assistance based on friendship, deep respect and mutual understanding.

    在四月七日亚洲国家会议全体会议上
    苏联代表亚历山大·考湼楚克的发言
    我们以非常激动的心情听取了阿努普·辛格先生和中国代表团团长郭沫若先生的报告。他们就今天使亚洲各国人民感到不安的目前局势中的最重要的问题向我们作了深刻的分析。
    苏联代表团对这些发言的代表表示深深的感谢。
    我们苏联人民认为世界上最大的幸福莫过于全世界享受稳定的和平和在一切国家人民之间保持善意。
    苏联人民心中充满了这种感情，因为我们伟大的祖国在它的旗帜上写下了建立完全致力于建设性的劳动的新的更加美好的生活的格言，这种劳动保证人们的幸福不断增加，促进我们各共和国民族文化的繁荣和它们之间的兄弟般的友谊，提高物质和精神价值以谋求更加幸福和和平的生活，并谋求世界和平和一切国家之间的亲密友谊。
    苏联政府领袖尼·亚·布尔加宁一九五五年二月九日在苏联最高苏维埃会议上说：“世界各国人民最强烈的愿望莫过于对和平的愿望。”“苏联政府今后仍将一贯地执行在实践中证明正确的、巩固和平和普遍安全的政策，执行和各国保持友好关系的政策。”苏联人民的和平努力已经在憎恨战争和美国反动派奉行的粗暴的“以实力为后盾”的政策的全世界人民心中，得到越来越大的响应。美国反动派奉行这种政策的目的是要奴役各国人民，替华尔街的利益服务。他们在争取世界霸权的疯狂活动中，竟然千方百计阻挠禁止核子武器，以便用原子弹讹诈、威胁和勒索来恫吓各国人民，迫使各国放弃自己的民族独立。他们支持对他们俯首听命的政府，通过参加侵略集团的办法把这些国家的双手束缚起来，利用它们去实现那些妄想独霸世界的人的新的恶毒的意愿。
    这就是美国侵略集团和他们的欧洲朋友们一味想破坏苏联的一切目的在于禁止原子武器和对这种禁止进行有效的监督的建议的原因。没有多久以前，美国政客们曾硬说苏联政府所以始终主张禁止原子武器，是因为苏联还没有这种武器，而且在十年至十五年以内还不能拥有这种武器。但是这种谎言完全破产了。今天，在氢武器生产方面落后的不是苏联而是美国了。但是，这种情况并没有影响苏维埃国家的和平政策。苏联人民正在一致在世界和平理事会常务委员会的要求销毁储存的原子武器的呼吁书上签名。全世界都知道苏联已向美国政府建议签订关于不使用原子武器的协议。在今年二月，苏联外交部长莫洛托夫提出了若干新的建设性建议。他在向最高苏维埃所作的报告中说：“我们建议美国不要在生产原子武器方面进行竞赛，而是在和平利用原子能方面进行竞赛。”世界上第一个原子能电力工厂已经在苏联开始发电了。亲爱的朋友们，让我告诉你们，苏联根据在原子能的和平研究工作方面和使用方面实行更广泛的国际合作的原则，把这些方面的科学、技术和工业的援助给予若干国家。苏联现在正在考虑给予另外一些国家以援助。这些目的在于增加苏联将给予关于和平利用原子能方面的科学、技术和工业的援助的国家数目的步骤，无疑将被各国人民认为是对和平事业的一种新贡献，并且将受到经济上落后的国家的热烈欢迎；这些国家并不由于它们自己的过错，迄今还没有充分的设备和条件用它们自己的方法进行这方面的研究。
    这种倡议表明苏联强烈地希望把最巨大的自然力量用于和平目的以造福人民，使各国得到好处和幸福。
    这种倡议是我国政府和我国人民的和平外交政策的坚定原则的重要部分。这是新战争的支持者企图加以歪曲和不让人们知道的事实。
    地位很高的美国原子贩子和他们的显赫的将军们，近来不仅丧失了他们的现实感，并且连常识也丧失了。他们用原子弹威胁苏联、中国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国和人民民主国家以及其他决不同意以自由和独立来换取美元和美国垄断资本的积压了长时期的货物的国家。
    某些参议员和众议员发表了愈来愈多的煽动战争的言论。这些言论的目的是为了恫吓世界各国人民，摧毁他们要求和平的意志，把他们投入另一次世界大战的火焰中去。但是在美国流行了几年的战争歇斯底里的结果怎样呢？“以实力为后盾”的原子外交的结果怎样呢？首先，它使世界各国爱好自由的人民在他们为和平而斗争的崇高任务中团结得更紧密了；它揭穿了那些把他们的人血贩子的利益置于民族和国家的利益之上的、在臭名昭彰的侵略条约上签了字的政客和政治家们的假面具。
    它打开了千百万人民的眼睛，使他们看清了谁正在策划反对人类的阴谋。它使许多美国人感到了不安，并且动摇了他们对他们的前途的信心。不错，人们应当承认美国、英国和法国政府的确曾几次谈到它们希望就裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题进行谈判。可是在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会中代表美国、英国、法国和加拿大的政府的那些委员们，却在北大西洋公约组织理事会会议上通过决议，授权这个集团的以美国将军为首的最高司令部在将来的战争中使用原子武器。如果也考虑到美国和它的唯命是从的朋友们没有让印度、中国、也没有让捷克斯洛伐克参加小组委员会这一事实，那么连对政治一无所知的傻子也不难理解是谁，又是为了什么目的，在有助于缓和国际紧张局势的争取解决极端迫切的问题的道路上设下了障碍。
    苏联曾屡次建议采取第一个重要步骤，即各国承担不使用原子武器的庄严义务。
    朋友们，你们知道，在联合国大会第九届会议上（去年九月），苏联代表团曾建议缔结一项国际公约，规定禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他类型的大规模毁灭性武器，裁减常规军备，并对这个公约的遵守建立国际监督。在讨论了苏联的建议和其他的建议后，联合国裁军委员会小组委员会受命采取新的措施，以便在这些重大问题上取得协议。事实上，这一决定由于巴黎协定遭到了严重的损害，因为巴黎协定的目的是要加紧军备竞赛和进行原子战争。当美国外交家和他们的朋友们的政府正在把原子武器交给纳粹将军，把日本变成另一艘不沉的原子航空母舰，并以新的军事基地来包围苏联、中国和人民民主国家的时候，他们口头上谈论和平又有什么价值呢？他们霸占了属于中国的台湾，同蒋介石缔结了不体面的条约，并正在以原子武器威胁为数六亿的人民，这些人民经历过人类所不能想像的苦难，受过最厉害的桎梏，经历过空前的霸道和不幸，曾经由于“文明的帝国主义者”和他们的傀儡——中国人民的刽子手——而血流成河。在他们这样做的时候，他们关于各国自由的大家庭、关于文明和崇高的人道主义的原则的说教又值几文钱呢？
    由于注意到坚决要求销毁储存的原子武器和氢武器的苏联人民和全世界广大公众的意志，苏联政府于二月十八日在它在联合国大会第九届会议上的建议之外提出新的建议，主张所有的国家承担下列义务：
    一、完全销毁各国储存的全部原子弹和氢弹，只把可分裂物质用于和平目的。
    二、不得使自己的武装部队人数和军备的数量增加到超过一九五五年一月一日的水平，也不得使自己预算中用于军事方面的拨款增加到超过一九五五年度预算拨款的水平。
    对这些决议的执行建立国际监督是极其重要的。苏联政府认识到，各国人民对于解决裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题都有切身利害的关系。决不可以把任何一个国家——不管它是不是联合国会员国——排斥在外，而不让它参加完成这一个重要而迫切的任务的工作。苏联政府认为，联合国有必要不迟于今年年底召开一次关于原子武器问题的世界会议。但是苏联这个具有重大意义的建议在担任负责职务的美国人士中间和他们的北大西洋公约组织的伙伴们中间并没有得到应有的支持。
    美国反动集团被他们的“以实力为后盾”的疯狂政策迷住了眼睛，他们把苏联提出的每一个新的建设性建议都看成是软弱的表现。同时，他们一味吹嘘他们本国的军事力量。他们在和平这个光辉而伟大的字眼上加上了“只有通过实力才能赢得”这样的字眼，这样他们就一笔勾销了和平这个字眼所传达的伟大概念的实质。他们把他们在海外的基地叫做“最大的进行报复的工具”或者“以实力为后盾的和平”或“以实力为后盾进行谈判的决心”。这就是外交家们所说的话，而在这一方面杜勒斯则远远跑在他的同伴的前面。但是，对美国某些有势力的参议员说来，世界和平，即使是“以实力为后盾”的世界和平，似乎也是一种侮辱。他们说：由于原子弹的出现，唯一可能采取的战略就是进行预防性战争的战略，因此他们坚持要对伟大的苏联、中国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国和各人民民主国家的人民发动预防性战争。
    我们苏联人民了解美国战争贩子的原子狂和美国人民以及那些不支持“以实力为后盾”的政策、不希望有可耻的原子战争的头脑清醒的美国政界人士和社会人士的真正愿望之间的区别；他们伟大国家的最好传统同美国人民的天才所创造的一切一样是他们所极为珍视的。
    苏联人民衷心赞同苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫最近对美国记者发表的谈话中所说的那一番出色的话。他说：“国与国之间的关系不应当建立在‘实力地位’政策的基础上，而建立在互相谅解的基础上。为此，首先就需要在互利的条件下，发展正常的贸易。为此，就应当不威胁别的国家。必须要那些拿原子弹吓人的疯子放规矩一些。这就会使各国人民得到安宁。
    苏联正在努力同别的国家发展正常的事务和贸易关系，以便使这种正常关系得到巩固，变成友好的关系。苏联没有和美国争执的问题。苏联人对美国人民有着友好的感情。如果美国政府想从苏联这里得到什么，那末可以肯定，美国政府要用勒索和威胁的办法，是什么也得不到的。威胁和讹诈是不会有什么结果的，因为苏联从来不曾而且今后也不会向威胁让步。”
    苏联人民是不怕威胁的。当我们的国家还是世界上唯一的社会主义国家的时候，别人差不多都对我们进行威胁；许许多多人都成了形形色色的预言家，他们叫嚷说这个年轻的国家是孱弱的，并预言它免不了要垮台。但是，今天这些预言家们在那里呢？他们当中有些人已患怀乡病和仇恨人类的忧郁症而死去，而另外一些人则仍然用老调子唱着他们的新歌子，但是已没有什么力量了，他们的合唱使人想起那些在黑夜中在陌生的院子里鼓翼恶叫的、饥饿的、羽毛乱蓬蓬的飞鸟。
    我想，朋友们，你们大家都知道，联合国裁军委员会小组委员会近来在伦敦举行会议。三月十八日，苏联政府建议缔结一项关于裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性的核子武器的国际公约。苏联建议以法国和英国一九五四年六月十一日的建议作为这一公约的基础。苏联政府根据法英提案的要点，建议有关国家在六个月或十二个月的时间内把它们的军备、军事部队和军事预算减到大家商定的标准的一半。这一削减应当以一九五五年一月一日的水平作为标准。苏联建议规定美、英、法、中、苏等大国大量削减军备和军事部队。在大家商定裁减军备和军事部队的标准时应当适当地考虑每个国家的地理、经济和政治因素以及人口的数目。苏联建议中强调对于履行根据这个公约承担的义务实行有效的国际监督，这种监督应当在一开始时就建立起来。
    苏联的建议中提供了在裁减军备和军事人员的最初阶段之后进一步采取的措施，这些措施目的在于在采取禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的步骤的同时，进一步裁减军备。
    但是，联合国裁军委员会小组委员会中西方国家的代表不但避不考虑苏联建议的要点，而且企图以军备和军事人员的水平问题来替代裁减军备和军事人员的一致同意的标准的问题。他们硬说：某些国家有权提出增加它们的军备和军事人员的问题。
    大家可以看出，他们所做的正像俄国谚语所说，开头举杯祝君健康，最后说：“灵魂安息吧！”
    至于五大国裁减军备和军事人员以及军事预算三分之一，并以此作为一致同意的标准的建议，却遭到了西方国家的断然拒绝。同样，它们实际上拒绝讨论裁减军备和禁止核子武器的具体日期。但是，假如对于全世界的命运那样重要的协议连实现的日期也不提到，那又有什么用处呢？
    我因而又想起了乌克兰的一句俗话：“日出之前，朝露会使人着凉而死”。
    请允许我提醒大家：在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会开始工作以前，有些西方政界人士——报纸也跟着他们——一心只想加速军备竞赛，尤其是扩大生产原子武器和氢武器。他们就这样把禁止这些武器的主张在实现以前扼杀了。人们考虑到这些事实就可以知道，他们在这个问题上仍然坚持原来的立场。
    他们不但不设法达成协议，反而用尽各种新旧手段分散世界人民的注意力，隐藏他们自己的侵略意图。
    策划“以实力为后盾的和平”的人们丧失了幽默感，匆匆制造了一个领有总统关于裁军问题特别助理头衔的、名叫史塔生的新和平天使。人们应当赞扬他，这个天使近年来走遍欧洲和亚洲，不辞辛劳地建立军事集团和组织对各国的经济压力。
    这样看来，有一只鸟变了羽毛，要变成孔雀，然而，这是枉费心机的，它的声音就暴露了它的本质。一切都是徒劳，因为应当改变的不是羽毛，而是声音本身，我指的是“以实力为后盾”的声音。人们不应当采取闪避态度，而应当趁各国还没有丧失耐心的时候设法通过最高级谈判来取得协议。
    全世界各国人民具有充分决心要使他们争取销毁大规模毁灭性核子武器的斗争取得成功的结果，决心制止军备竞赛，并且争取国际持久和平、友谊和亲善。
    我亲爱的朋友们，让我向你们保证，尽管密云笼罩着世界，但是，我们苏联人民一定要加紧努力争取禁止大规模毁灭性武器，争取世界和平，因为我们确信世界各族人民是具有要求和平的不屈不挠的愿望的，这种和平愿望能够而且一定会击败战争贩子的任何计划。
    我们希望，亚洲爱好和平的国家会一致支持世界和平理事会常务委员会的告全世界人民书，而且在这个表达了全世界各国人民要求销毁一切国家储存的原子武器的愿望的告全世界人民书上签名。
    印度和中国根据五项原则缔结了条约，为其他国家建立和平友好关系开辟了道路，这两个伟大国家对和平事业作出的不可估量的贡献使苏联各族人民深为感动。
    我代表苏联人民对伟大的印度人民和以明智的政治家尼赫鲁为首的印度政府表示最热烈的友谊和深切的敬意。我还很高兴地告诉诸位，我亲爱的朋友们，你们的国家和亚洲一切国家将永远感到苏联人民是最真诚无私的朋友，对苏联人民来说，最为重要的是各国的幸福和繁荣，自由和民族独立，在友好基础上的兄弟般的互助，深切的尊重和彼此了解。
