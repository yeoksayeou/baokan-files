How Zhejiang Organizes "Joint Public-Private Purchasing"
    Guo Zhongwang

    Zhejiang's eastern region is mostly mountainous, rich in various local and specialty products; the western region has a temperate climate and fertile soil, making agricultural products extremely abundant. Currently, the province has nearly six hundred types of agricultural, local, and specialty products (including handicrafts), among which tea, cotton, silk, and oils are known as the "Four Treasures" of Zhejiang. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the province has actively promoted the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. Through supporting production and vigorous organization of purchasing by state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, driving private commerce, the output of local and specialty products has significantly increased. However, due to the needs of the country's planned economic construction and the rapid growth of people's purchasing power exceeding the growth rate of local and specialty product production, many local and specialty products are still in short supply.

    To stabilize prices, ensure the completion of national purchasing plans, arrange markets, and transform private merchants, Zhejiang Province, in 1954, in addition to the materials subject to state monopoly purchase and marketing, relatively widely organized joint public and private commercial purchasing of agricultural, local, and specialty products (hereinafter referred to as "joint public-private purchasing"). The facts of the past year have proven that this method of "joint public-private purchasing" is a transitional and auxiliary form that is currently active in material exchange. It is beneficial to national purchasing, farmer sales, market arrangements, and the transformation of private merchants.

    The basic content of "joint public-private purchasing" is: under unified purchasing plans, purchasing prices, and specifications, the organized joint purchasing of public and private commerce under leadership. The business activities of "joint public-private purchasing" are bound by certain regulations of the industrial and commercial administrative departments. In this way, the original scattered, blind purchasing activities of private purchasing merchants, directly contacting farmers for the purchasing of important industrial raw materials, export goods, and non-staple foods, have been changed into planned and organized joint purchasing under the management of industrial and commercial administrative departments and the leadership of state-owned commerce or supply and marketing cooperatives. This strengthens market planning, restricts the blindness and destructiveness of private local product purchasing merchants, and guides them onto the path of state capitalism. To unify market arrangements and adjust sources of goods, last year Zhejiang Province, in addition to organizing "joint public-private purchasing" for important materials such as tea, raw silk, tobacco leaves, and live pigs, also implemented supervised sales of private purchasing merchants, that is, supervising private merchants to sell the goods obtained from participating in "joint public-private purchasing" to designated areas and designated targets. This allows private merchants to purchase and profit, allowing them to maintain their business, while also incorporating the purchasing and sales of private merchants into the state plan. Therefore, in the case of insufficient goods, the completion of the national plan and the stability of the market were guaranteed, and the business of private merchants was maintained.

    For general, scattered, and less important local and specialty products, "joint public-private purchasing" can actively drive private merchants to purchase in rural areas. Especially last year, when farmers were unwilling to sell their products to private merchants, increasing the difficulties in private commerce, the organization of joint public-private commercial purchasing in rural areas overcame the difficulties of private merchants in purchasing in rural areas and maintained their business. Last year in Zhejiang Province, "joint public-private purchasing" of dried bamboo shoots, mountain walnuts, and small medicinal materials played a significant role in leading private local product merchants to overcome the off-season and invigorate the off-season market. At the same time, through "joint public-private purchasing," the legitimate business enthusiasm of private local and specialty product purchasing merchants can be fully utilized, using their personnel, funds, equipment, and technical experience to serve the communication of urban and rural exchanges, allowing state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives to concentrate their efforts on organizing the purchasing of major commodities.

    Organizing "joint public-private purchasing" can also correctly grasp the public-private purchasing ratio according to the Party's policies and national planning requirements; at the same time, unify the market management methods in various places, correct the current tendencies of being too tight or too loose in market management, and change the past practice of simply using administrative orders to restrict private merchants from raising prices and rushing to purchase, replacing it with state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives establishing direct economic ties with private commerce to lead and supervise private merchants, so that they cannot disrupt the purchasing market. Through the orderly organization of purchasing and unified planning, prices, and specifications through "joint public-private purchasing," farmers' incomes are stabilized, thereby guiding farmers' production in a planned manner. Before "joint public-private purchasing" in Dongyang County, Zhejiang Province, private merchants blindly rushed to purchase grass mats, and farmers reflected: "Grass mats are neither good nor bad, having goods is money," so the quality was poor. After organizing "joint public-private purchasing," the quality of grass mats generally improved due to the implementation of a reasonable grading and pricing policy.

    The methods of "joint public-private purchasing" are diverse: there are specialized "joint public-private purchasing" for purchasing a certain type of local product; there are comprehensive "joint public-private purchasing" for purchasing several types of local products; for local products that are available on the market year-round, long-term "joint public-private purchasing" is organized; for local products that are available on the market seasonally, seasonal or temporary "joint public-private purchasing" is organized. From a regional perspective, there is province-wide "joint public-private purchasing"; there is "joint public-private purchasing" in key production areas; there is "joint public-private purchasing" in primary markets with a district or town as a unit. Purchasing methods: for general local products, the joint purchasing office itself sets up stations for purchasing, so as to fully utilize the strength of private merchants and reduce the joint purchasing expenses borne by private merchants; for important local products, the basic-level supply and marketing cooperatives can be uniformly entrusted to purchase; in areas with existing local product exchanges, the local product exchanges are used for purchasing. Sales methods: for general local products, joint purchasing and distribution are adopted, or, on a voluntary basis, private-private joint sales can be adopted; for local products that the state must uniformly control the plan, it is stipulated that private merchants must be supervised to sell after joint purchasing. The methods of paying funds include paying in full at one time, paying in installments, and paying on the same day. In terms of leading economic nature, there are those led by state-owned commerce; there are those led by supply and marketing cooperatives. We study and adopt the above methods separately according to different commodities and different regions, adapting to local conditions.

    The general practice of "joint public-private purchasing" is: first, it is necessary to understand the production, supply, and sales situation and the operating capacity of private merchants, so as to properly arrange. Then, establish an organization, handle the registration of private merchant purchasing plans, uniformly balance the public-private purchasing ratio, determine the purchasing price, specifications, and purchasing methods, and agree on joint purchasing regulations. These are reviewed by the industrial and commercial administrative departments before purchasing is carried out in a planned and organized manner.

    The organizational work of "joint public-private purchasing" is quite complex. It must be managed by the industrial and commercial administrative departments under the unified leadership of the Party committee, with the participation of state-owned commerce or supply and marketing cooperatives responsible for business leadership. It must also closely coordinate with relevant departments to solve related problems.

    The distribution of public and private purchasing ratios is the key to grasping the market and arranging private merchants. It must be fully consulted through professional meetings in accordance with national policies and planning requirements.

    In the process of joint purchasing, purchasing and distribution of goods should be flexible, so as not to cause the accumulation of goods and funds, and the different situations of large merchants, small merchants, local and foreign private merchants should be taken into account. In the primary market, there are many private merchant personnel and little capital. Originally, they relied on the rapid turnover of funds to maintain their business. If the joint purchasing stipulates a set of complicated procedures, the turnover of funds will be stagnant, and private merchants will not be able to maintain it. For the joint purchasing of certain fresh goods that are difficult to store (such as oranges), it is best to purchase and distribute the goods on the same day, making it convenient for farmers and willing for private merchants.

    It is best to hang a signboard with the words "Purchasing Station of the Joint Public-Private Purchasing Office of [Commodity Name]" at the joint purchasing station, and announce the purchasing prices and specifications, so that farmers can distinguish them. The business work of the joint purchasing station should give full play to the role of private merchants and use the strength of private merchants, but state-owned commerce or supply and marketing cooperatives must send cadres to lead and supervise them.

    The "joint public-private purchasing" organization is an economic organization, not an administrative management agency. Therefore, the market should not be tightly controlled by using joint purchasing to replace administration, but the leading role of state-owned commerce or supply and marketing cooperatives should be brought into play in the joint purchasing organization, and the purchasing activities of private merchants should be grasped to guide them to conduct legitimate business. The "joint public-private purchasing" organization is also not an enterprise organization, and it is not responsible for profits and losses itself.

    For some small merchants and peddlers who have difficulties in participating in joint purchasing, they may be allowed to conduct their own sporadic purchasing, or, in accordance with the principle of mutual assistance and cooperation, they may be organized to participate in joint purchasing, or they may be led by supply and marketing cooperatives and utilized through the joint purchasing office.

    In "joint public-private purchasing," it is also necessary to do a good job in publicity, explaining the nature, significance, and benefits of "joint public-private purchasing" to the country and farmers, educating farmers to actively sell products to the joint purchasing office, and mobilizing the masses of farmers to supervise private merchants and stop their destructive activities. Policy and ideological education should be carried out for private merchants, and while utilizing them, their speculative activities must be prevented and cracked down on.

    浙江是怎样组织“公私联购”的
    郭中旺
    浙江的东部多山，盛产各种土、特产品；西部气候温和，土壤肥沃，农产品极为丰富。目前全省有农、土、特产品（包括手工业品）近六百种，其中茶叶、棉花、丝绸、油脂素称浙江“四宝”。解放以来，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，积极开展城乡物资交流，扶植生产，国营商业和合作社商业带动私营商业大力组织收购的结果，土、特产的产量已有显著提高。但由于国家有计划的经济建设需要和人民购买力的迅速增长超过了土、特产生产增长的速度，所以目前许多土、特产品还是供不应求。
    为了稳定物价，保证完成国家收购计划和安排市场、改造私商，一九五四年浙江省除了国家宣布统购统销的物资外，比较普遍地组织了公、私商业联合收购农、土、特产品（简称“公私联购”下同）。一年来的事实证明：这种“公私联购”的方式，是目前活跃物资交流的一种过渡性质的辅助形式。对国家收购，农民出售，安排市场和改造私商，都有好处。
    “公私联购”的基本内容是：在统一的收购计划、收购价格和规格下，有领导地组织公私商业进行联合收购。“公私联购”的业务活动，受工商行政部门一定的规章所约束。这样，在重要的工业原料、出口物资和副食品的收购上，把原来私营收购商分散的、盲目的、与农民直接联系的收购活动，改变为受工商行政部门管理、国营商业或供销合作社领导下，有计划有组织的联合收购，因而加强了市场的计划性，限制私营土产收购商的盲目性和破坏性，并引导其走上国家资本主义轨道。为了统一安排市场，调剂货源，去年浙江省对茶叶、土丝、烟叶、生猪等重要物资，除组织“公私联购”外，还实行对私营收购商的监督销售，即监督私商必须把参加“公私联购”分得的商品，向指定地区和指定对象出售。这样既允许私商收购，并使之有利，得以维持，又把私商的收购和销售都纳入国家计划。因此在货源不足的情况下，保证了国家计划的完成和市场的稳定，而且维持了私商的营业。
    对于一般零星次要的土、特产，通过“公私联购”可以积极带动私商下乡收购。特别是去年农民不愿把产品卖给私商，增加了私营商业上的困难时，组织了公私商业联合下乡收购，就克服了私商下乡收购的困难，维持了它们的营业。浙江省去年对笋干、山核桃、小药材等通过“公私联购”，在领导私营土产商渡过淡季和活跃淡季市场方面有很大作用。同时，通过“公私联购”，可以充分发挥私营土、特产收购商正当的经营积极性，利用其人员、资金、设备和技术经验为沟通城乡交流服务，让国营商业和供销合作社集中力量组织主要商品的收购。
    组织“公私联购”，还可以根据党的政策和国家计划要求，正确掌握公私收购比例；同时统一各地市场的管理办法，纠正目前市场管理上偏紧偏宽的偏向，并且改变过去单纯用行政命令来限制私商抬价抢购的做法，代之以国营商业和供销合作社同私营商业建立经济上的直接联系来领导和监督私商，使其不能破坏收购市场。通过“公私联购”有秩序地组织收购和统一计划、价格、规格，使农民收入稳定，从而有计划地指导了农民生产。浙江省东阳县在“公私联购”前，私商盲目抢购草席，农民反映：“草席没好坏，有货就是钱”，所以质量不好。组织“公私联购”后，由于贯彻了合理分等论价政策，草席质量普遍提高。
    “公私联购”的方式是多种多样的：有收购某一种土产的专业性“公私联购”；有收购数种土产的综合性“公私联购”；对常年上市的土产，组织长期性“公私联购”；对季节上市的土产，则组织季节性或临时性“公私联购”。从地区来说，有全省性的“公私联购”；有重点产区“公私联购”；有初级市场以一区一镇为单位的“公私联购”。收购方式：对于一般土产是联购处本身设站收购，以便充分发挥私商力量并减少私商负担联购经费；对重要土产可以统一委托基层供销合作社收购；在原有土产交易所的地区，则利用土产交易所收购。销售方式：对一般土产采取联购分销或在自愿的基础上，可以私私联销；对于国家必须统一掌握计划的土产，则规定联购后再监督私商销售。缴纳资金的方式上有一次缴足的，有分期缴的，也有当日缴的。在领导经济性质上，有国营商业参加领导的；有供销合作社参加领导的。以上各种方式我们根据不同商品不同地区因地制宜，分别研究采用。
    “公私联购”的做法大体是：首先要摸清产、供、销情况和私商的经营能力，以便妥善安排。然后成立组织，办理私商收购计划登记，统一平衡公私收购比例，确定收购价格、规格和收购方式，议定联购规章。这些都经过工商行政部门审查后，才有计划有组织地展开收购。
    “公私联购”的组织工作是相当复杂的，必须在党委统一领导下，由工商行政部门管理，国营商业或供销合作社参加并负责业务领导，并且要同有关部门密切配合行动，以便协同解决有关问题。
    分配公私收购比例是掌握市场和安排私商的关键，必须按照国家政策和计划要求，通过专业会议，充分协商。
    在联购过程中，收购、分货要灵活，不要使商品和资金积压起来，并且要照顾到大商、小商和本地、外地私商的不同情况。初级市场私商人员多，资金少，原是依靠迅速周转资金来维持经营的，如果联购规定了一套繁杂手续，则资金周转呆滞，私商就无法维持。对某些难以保管的鲜货（如橘子）的联购，最好当天收购当天就分货，使农民方便，私商愿意。
    联购站最好挂上“某某商品公私联购处收购站”的招牌，并公布收购价格和规格，以便农民辨别。联购站的业务工作，要多发挥私商作用，运用私商力量，但国营商业或供销合作社必须派干部加以领导和监督。
      “公私联购”组织是一种经济组织，不是行政管理机构。因此不能以联购来代替行政把市场管死，而应该在联购组织中，发挥国营商业或供销合作社的领导作用，掌握私商的收购活动，引导他们进行正当经营。“公私联购”组织也不是企业机构，它本身不负盈亏责任。
    对于某些参加联购有困难的小商小贩，可以允许他们自行零星收购，或根据互助合作的方针，组织起来后参加联购，或由供销合作社领导，通过联购处加以利用。
    在“公私联购”中，还必须做好宣传工作，向农民说明“公私联购”的性质、意义和对国家对农民的好处，教育农民踊跃出售产品给联购处，并发动农民群众监督私商，制止他们的破坏活动。对私商要进行政策思想教育，既要加以利用，又必须防止和打击其投机活动。
