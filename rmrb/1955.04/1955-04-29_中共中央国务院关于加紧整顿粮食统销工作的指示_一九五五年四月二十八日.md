Instruction of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council on Intensifying the Rectification of Grain Unified Sales Work
April 28, 1955

At present, the work of fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales of grain in rural areas across the country has basically come to an end. This measure has enabled farmers to further understand the state's grain unified purchase policy and has played a beneficial role in promoting spring plowing production. However, in many areas, the grain unified sales work for the period from March to June of this year was not carried out in a timely manner in conjunction with the above-mentioned work of fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales, so that the erroneous mentality of the masses regarding the unified sales work has not been corrected, and many farmers who are not short of grain also want to buy grain from the state. Because some Party and government workers, especially at the grassroots level, have an erroneous idea that simply supplementing grain sales can solve the problems in grain unified sales, they have adopted a simple, laissez-faire, and indiscriminate supply approach to grain unified sales, regardless of whether or not there is a shortage of grain. In addition, a very small number of workers have engaged in malfeasance and corruption, resulting in the sales of grain during this period greatly exceeding the reasonable targets set by the state, and this trend is still developing. For example, Shandong Province sold 630 million jin of grain in March, averaging 21 million jin per day; Guangxi Province sold 9.27 million jin of grain per day in the first half of April; Jiangsu Province sold about 30 million jin of grain per day in late March. The amount of grain sold to rural areas in many provinces, if calculated at one jin per person per day, is equivalent to supplying 70 to 80 percent of the rural population of the entire province, and in some counties, the number of people supplied is as high as 95 percent or more. Moreover, it is precisely in the places with the highest sales that the cries of "grain shortage" are the loudest. Obviously, this situation is extremely abnormal and extremely dangerous, and it must be reversed immediately without delay.

It must be affirmed that it is entirely possible to compress and control grain sales. Investigation materials from many places show that a considerable portion of the large amount of grain sold in rural areas is bought by farmers who are not short of grain. The main situation in rural areas with excessive grain sales is that farmers who are short of grain are buying grain, and farmers who are not short of grain are also buying grain. Those who should buy less are buying more, those who should buy later are buying earlier, and those who have already bought are still buying. Everyone is shouting about a grain shortage. Many farmers who are not short of grain sell their surplus grain to the state during the state's unified purchase, but after the unified purchase of grain, they try their best to buy back grain. Many landlords, rich peasants, and a small number of lurking counter-revolutionaries even go further to instigate and sabotage. However, the needs of some truly grain-deficient farmers, mainly poor peasants, have not been effectively guaranteed under these circumstances. However, the vast majority of farmers are not aware of this situation. After propaganda and education, they will definitely not be willing to undermine the state's grain unified sales policy, create difficulties for the state, and prevent truly grain-deficient farmers from getting grain. On the contrary, they are willing to help the state fairly and reasonably solve the grain supply problem. Experience in many places has proven that as long as the "make-up" work of rectifying unified sales is done well, the tense situation can be immediately eased, and grain sales can generally be reduced by 20 to 30 percent compared to the originally required supply volume, and in some cases, even reduced by more than half. Moreover, farmers who are indeed short of grain receive the supply they deserve. Therefore, it can be said that as long as correct and resolute measures are taken in a timely manner to ensure that sales targets are not breached, it is entirely possible.

The key to solving this urgent and major problem lies in deeply mobilizing the masses and in carrying out sufficient political and mass work to make the masses understand the state's policies and the real way out of solving the grain problem. In all provinces and regions where grain sales exceed targets, government agencies and Party organizations must immediately mobilize, go to the masses, first clear the minds of cadres, Party members, League members, and activists, and effectively solve their own grain supply problems. Then, together with them, conduct full propaganda and explanation to the peasant masses, enlighten the peasants' awareness, dispel their concerns, and lead the peasant masses in a planned way, relying on and through the masses, to solve the grain supply problem. The specific approach should be: The state's grain sales targets for the township for May, June and July, August, and September should be announced to the masses through the township people's congresses and mass meetings, explaining to the farmers the state's grain sales situation for the township and district, and analyzing the figures requested for supply in the township and district. It should be explained that the state's sales targets should not and cannot be increased any further, and that as long as non-grain-deficient households do not rush to buy, these figures can fully guarantee the supply of truly grain-deficient farmers. Then, the masses should be mobilized for full deliberation and repeated discussion. The supply requests of each household should be evaluated one by one, and the numbers that should not be supplied, can be supplied less, or can be postponed should be resolutely reduced. On the principle of thrift, the indispensable supply of grain-deficient households should be effectively guaranteed, and grain purchase certificates should be issued, with supply based on certificates thereafter. In places where grain purchase certificates have already been issued, the evaluation work can be re-verified on the basis of the original grain purchase certificates according to the above-mentioned principles, so that truly grain-deficient households receive the supply they deserve, while supply to non-grain-deficient households is stopped. Instances of malfeasance should be corrected, and bad elements who deliberately fabricate rumors and sabotage unified sales work should be cracked down upon. It must be pointed out that the content of rectifying unified sales work is primarily and mainly to reduce the portion that should not be supplied in order to ensure a reasonable supply and ensure that the state's sales targets are not breached. This is the main aspect. As for those who have bought too much in the past and are now in a position to withdraw, some of it can be withdrawn after persuasion and education, depending on the circumstances, in order to adjust the supply for grain-deficient households. It should be understood that in the work of rectifying unified sales, if patient education and appropriate criticism are not given to those who are not short of grain but also cry out for a grain shortage, it will be impossible to guarantee the lives and production of grain-deficient households, and it will be impossible to do a good job in the current rural grain supply work. However, on the other hand, attention should also be paid to a certain limit, which is that it is not permissible to mobilize farmers to further demand that surplus grain households take out some of their original surplus grain, because that would easily lead to squeezing the middle peasants, infringing on the interests of the middle peasants, thereby causing chaos in the countryside, affecting spring plowing production, and offsetting the positive role of the "Three Fixes" work. Therefore, this is not conducive to the unity of the peasants and does not conform to the state's policy toward the middle peasants.

The State Council and the CCP Central Committee request that the Party committees and people's governments of all provinces and cities, within about twenty days after receiving this instruction, combine the main points of this instruction with local conditions, formulate their own instructions and arrangements, transmit them all the way down to the township level, and begin to implement them.

    中共中央国务院关于加紧整顿粮食统销工作的指示
    一九五五年四月二十八日
    目前全国农村粮食的定产、定购、定销工作已经基本结束。这一措施使农民进一步了解了国家的粮食统购政策，对于推动春耕生产起了有利的作用。但许多地区，由于没有结合上述定产、定购、定销工作及时地作好本年三月份至六月份的粮食统销工作，以至群众中对统销工作的错误心理没有得到纠正，许多并不缺粮的农民也要向国家买粮。由于一些地区的党政工作人员特别是基层工作人员有一种错误的想法，即认为单纯的补充粮食销量就可以解决粮食统销中的问题，因而对粮食统销工作采取了简单从事、放任自流和不问是否缺粮一律平均供应的作法，加上极少数工作人员还有徇私舞弊的行为，致使这一时期粮食的销量大大超过了国家规定的合理指标，而且这种趋势还在发展。例如山东省三月份销粮六亿三千万斤，平均每日销二千一百万斤；广西省四月上半月每日销粮九二七万斤；江苏省三月下旬每日销粮三千万斤左右。不少省份销于农村的粮食，如以每人每日供应一斤计算，等于供应了全省农村人口的百分之七十至八十，好些县份，供应的人数竟等于百分之九十五以上。而且正是销量越多的地方，叫喊“缺粮”的呼声越凶。很明显，这种状况是极端反常和极端危险的，必须毫不迟延地立即加以扭转。
    必须肯定，压缩和控制粮食的销量是完全可能的。许多地方的调查材料说明，在农村销售的大量粮食，有不小一部分是被并不缺粮的农民买去了。目前粮食超销地区的农村主要情况是：缺粮的农民在买粮，不缺粮的农民也在买粮，该少买的要多买，该迟买的要早买，已经买了的还要买，大家都喊缺粮。许多不缺粮的农民当国家统购时把余粮卖给国家，而在粮食统购以后，他们又尽量买回粮食；许多地主富农和少数潜伏的反革命分子更进而挑拨破坏；而某些真正缺粮的农民，主要是贫农，他们的需要在这种情况下倒反而没有得到切实的保证。但是绝大多数农民对于这种情况是并不自觉的，在经过宣传教育之后，他们决不愿意破坏国家的粮食统销政策，制造国家的困难，让真正缺粮的农民得不到粮食，相反地，他们愿意帮助国家公平合理地解决粮食供应问题。许多地方的经验证明，只要作好整顿统销的“补课”工作，紧张的情况就马上可以缓和，粮食的销量一般都能够比原来要求的供应量减少百分之二十、三十，有的甚至减少到一半以上，而且确实缺粮的农民，得到了应得的供应。因此可以说，只要及时采取正确的和坚决有效的措施，保证销售指标不被突破，是完全可能的。
    解决这一紧急重大问题的关键，在于深入地发动群众，在于进行充分的政治工作和群众工作，使群众明了国家的政策和解决粮食问题的真正出路。在一切粮食销售超过指标的省区，政府机关和党组织必须立即动员起来，到群众中去，首先打通干部、党团员和积极分子的思想，切实解决他们自己在粮食供应上存在的问题，然后同他们一起，向农民群众进行充分的宣传解释，启发农民的觉悟，解除农民的顾虑，有领导地发动农民群众，依靠并通过群众，解决粮食供应问题。具体作法应该是：将五、六两月和七、八、九月国家对本乡的粮食销售指标，通过乡人民代表大会和群众大会，向群众公开宣布，向农民说明国家对本乡、本区销售粮食的情况，分析本乡、本区要求供应的数字。说明国家销售指标不应当也不可能再加，说明只要非缺粮户不争着购买，这些数字完全可以保证真正缺粮农民的供应。然后发动群众，充分酝酿，反复讨论。对要求供应户，逐户进行评议，把不应供应、可以少供应或推迟供应的数字，坚决地削减下来，并在节约的原则下，切实保证缺粮户必不可少的供应，核发购粮证，以后即凭证供应。在已经发放购粮证的地方，评议工作可按上述原则，在原发购粮证的基础上进行复核，务使真正缺粮户得到应得的供应，而不缺粮户则停止供应。对于徇私舞弊的情形应当加以纠正，对于确系故意造谣破坏统销工作的坏分子应当给以打击。必须指出，整顿统销工作的内容，首先是而且主要是压缩不应供应的部分，来保证合理的供应，保证国家销售指标不被突破。这是主要的方面。至于有些过去多买了现在有条件退出的，也可以斟酌情况经过说服教育令其退出一部，以调剂缺粮户的供应。应当懂得，在整顿统销工作中，对那些不缺粮也叫喊缺粮的，如果不进行耐心的教育和适当的批评，就无法保证缺粮户的生活和生产，无法把当前农村的粮食供应工作作好。但是另一方面也要注意一定的限度，这就是不许可发动农民来进一步要求余粮户拿出自己原有的若干余粮，因为那样就容易形成对中农的挤逼，侵犯中农利益，从而引起农村中的混乱，影响春耕生产，抵销“三定”工作的积极作用。因此，这是不利于农民的团结，不合于国家对中农的政策的。
    国务院和中共中央要求各省市委和省市人民政府，在接到本指示后的二十天左右的时间内，将本指示的要点，结合当地情况，作出自己的指示和安排，一直传达到乡，并开始见之实行。
