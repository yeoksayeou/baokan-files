    A Batch of Northern Jiangsu Disaster Victims Return Home to Production
    From March 15th to 25th, 264 households, totaling over 1,100 disaster victims from Northern Jiangsu living along the Suzhou Creek in Shanghai, have returned to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production. More disaster victims are actively preparing to return home to participate in spring plowing. These disaster victims are farmers from Northern Jiangsu and other areas who came to Shanghai after being affected by the unprecedented floods last autumn and have land in their hometowns.
    As early as the beginning of March, the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau instructed the People's Government of the Water Area to establish a specialized agency and set up transfer stations in Beixinjing, Suzhou, and Jiangyin to take care of the disaster victims' travel and provide necessary food subsidies. Small steamers were also prepared in Jiangyin to escort the disaster victims' boats safely across the Yangtze River. The People's Governments of Xinghua, Huai'an, Dongtai, Jianhu, Yancheng and other counties in Jiangsu Province have also sent cadres to lead the disaster victims back to their hometowns.
    The disaster victims are very grateful for these measures taken by the People's Government and expressed that they will actively participate in agricultural production after returning home. The disaster victims from Liujia Village, Beijiang Township, Xinghua County, immediately organized eleven boats with a total of sixty-eight people into a mutual aid group to return home after hearing the dissemination of information regarding helping disaster victims return to production. Teng Jinyuan from Huai'an County read a letter from the head of his hometown, Nan'ai Village, knowing that the People's Government could lend rice seeds if they didn't have any and provide relief if they didn't have food. He said: "If we don't plant in the spring, we won't harvest in the autumn. The People's Government cares about us so much, we should hurry home to start production."

    苏北一批灾民回乡生产
    从三月十五日到二十五日，住在上海苏州河一带的苏北灾民，已有二百六十四户一千一百多人回家参加农业生产。更多的灾民正在积极准备赶回乡去参加春耕。这些灾民都是去年秋后受到百年来未有的大水侵袭而到上海来的苏北等地农民，他们在家乡都有田地。
    上海市民政局早在三月上旬就指示水上区人民政府成立专门机构，又在北新泾、苏州、江阴三地设立转送站，照顾灾民旅途生活和给以必需的口粮补助，并在江阴备有小火轮护送灾民船只安全渡过长江。江苏省兴化、淮安、东台、建湖、盐城等县的人民政府，也都先后派来干部带领灾民回乡。
    灾民们对人民政府的这些措施非常感激，表示回乡以后一定积极参加农业生产。从兴化县北蒋乡刘家村来的灾民，听到关于帮助灾民回乡生产的传达以后，马上自动组织了十一只船共六十八人的回乡互助组。来自淮安县的滕金元，读了他家乡南艾里乡乡长的来信，知道没有稻种人民政府可以贷给，没有口粮人民政府可以救济，他说：春不种秋不收，人民政府这样关怀我们，还是赶快回家生产。　（本报集体通讯员解放日报编辑部）
