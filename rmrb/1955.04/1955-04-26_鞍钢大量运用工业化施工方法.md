Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company's construction industrial company and metal structure manufacturing plant plan to produce more than double the amount of prefabricated products and structural components this year compared to last year. Currently, prefabricated components are being used on construction sites for blast furnaces, ore dressing plants, coke ovens, refractory material plants, and residential buildings. There are not many workers on the construction sites; they operate cranes to quickly install precast reinforced concrete components, metal structural components, and finished wood products, which have just been transported from various processing plants, onto the buildings. This industrialized construction method can speed up work by one to five times compared to the dispersed, artisanal methods used on-site. The First Concrete Mixing Plant, located in the center of Anshan Iron and Steel's construction sites, sends thousands of cubic meters of concrete to various construction projects every day. This not only saves labor compared to on-site mixing but also saves a lot of space for stacking materials, making construction more orderly. The ten processing plants belonging to various professional engineering companies have been further equipped this year and have increased their workload, which has basically made pipeline processing, electrical repair and fitting, and industrial furnace brick processing all industrialized.

To expand the scope of prefabricated components, various building materials manufacturing plants also plan to trial-produce more than 100 new products. A large precast reinforced concrete slab recently successfully trial-produced can be used as a roof panel for factory buildings. This precast slab can be hoisted onto the roof when it is transported to the construction site. It is not only faster than casting roof panels on-site but also saves purlins. (Xinhua News Agency)

    鞍钢大量运用工业化施工方法
    鞍山钢铁建设公司所属的建筑工业公司和金属结构制造厂今年计划生产的预制品和结构构件比去年增加一倍多。目前正在紧张施工的炼铁炉、选矿厂、炼焦炉、耐火材料厂和住宅建筑等工地上，都在采用预制构件。工地上工人不多，他们操纵着起重机械，就把刚从各加工厂运来的钢筋混凝土预制构件、金属结构构件和木材加工成品快速地安装到建筑物上去。这种工业化的施工方法，比在现场用分散的手工业方式工作，速度可以加快一倍到五倍以上。位于鞍钢各建筑工地中心的第一混凝土搅拌厂，每天都把上千立方公尺的混凝土分送给各个建筑工程，这不但比在现场搅拌节省人工，还节省许多堆积材料的场地，施工也更加有秩序了。分属于各专业工程公司的十个加工厂，今年装备也更加完善，并增加了工作量，这就使管道加工、电气修配、工业筑炉砖加工等工作，基本上都达到工厂化了。
    为扩大预制构件的使用范围，各建筑材料制造厂还计划试制一百多种新产品。最近试制成功的一种大型钢筋混凝土预制板，就可以用来作厂房的屋面板。这种预制板运到工地就能吊装到屋面上去，它不但比在现场捣制屋面板快，而且可以节省檩条。（新华社）
