    Don't Waste Metal Materials
    Li Yinpeng, Deputy Director of the Urban Design Institute of the City Construction Bureau

    We all know that without steel, we cannot build modern factories, manufacture machinery, construct bridges over the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, or transform agricultural production. In short, it is impossible to build heavy industry and realize socialist industrialization without steel.

    However, many of our buildings could have used more brick and stone, but instead used a large amount of steel. For example, the office building, club, and library of the Engineering College designed by us have a total construction area of 27,104 square meters. Because of the emphasis on the main building (office building) not only matching the palace-style buildings with large roofs built in the past, but also being more magnificent than the auxiliary buildings built last year, in order to show the grandeur of the main building, a palace-style large roof with double eaves was designed in the middle of the 17,725 square meter five-story office building. On the flat roof of the two-wing four-story building, a city gate-style pavilion was designed on each side, with a total area of 1,040 square meters. The lower layer of the large roof all used a frame structure. The club and library also used steel frames. The foundation was entirely poured with reinforced concrete. During the technical design, we conducted a preliminary estimate, and the steel alone required: about 97 tons for the foundation of the office building; about 258 tons for the large roof, frame, beams, slabs, and columns; about 138 tons for the foundation and basement of the club and library; about 114 tons for the frame; and about 152 tons for the beams, slabs, and columns. The total steel consumption was 759 tons. After studying Comrade Khrushchev's report at the All-Soviet Construction Workers Conference and the spirit of the February meeting of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, we examined the waste in the design and made modifications. Now, the large roof has been changed to a flat roof, the foundation has been changed to rubble concrete, the frame structure has been changed to a mixed structure, and the steel frame of the library has been changed to a wooden frame, which can save approximately 374 tons of steel (excluding elevators and other steel), and save more than 400,000 yuan in total cost.

    For example, when we designed the heating equipment for the Nanyuan dormitory area last year, there were 41 dormitory buildings with a construction area of 117,700 square meters and a land area of 41,046 square meters. The farthest distance of the heating pipeline was 900 meters. The original design used a steam heating system with eight steel plate boilers. After we learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and changed to a cast iron boiler single-pipe sequential forced circulation hot water heating test, we can save 176 tons of steel from eight steel plate boilers, reduce the boiler room area by 360 square meters, and save 338,200 yuan in cost.

    According to our understanding, similar phenomena of wasting steel also exist in other architectural design units. For example, the two luxurious office dormitories in Di'anmen, Beijing. The construction area is 42,110 square meters. The steel doors and windows used about 200 tons of steel. The six large roofs used 36 tons of rebar. The eaves, parapet walls, balconies, beams, slabs, and columns used about 623 tons of rebar. The basement and foundation used 11 tons of steel. In addition, there were eight elevators inside, requiring about 28 tons of steel. The total steel consumption was 898 tons. However, the steel required for a general mixed-structure five-story building is only 450 tons. These two buildings wasted 448 tons of steel. According to the comrade in charge of the construction site, when construction started last year, they had already proposed reducing the safety factor of 2 used in the original design to 1.8, which could save 30 tons of rebar. If the six steel plate boilers used for heating were changed to pig iron boilers, about 128 tons of steel could be saved. Otherwise, if construction is completed according to the original design, 606 tons of steel will be wasted.

    The steel wasted in the above three construction projects or designs alone totals 1,156 tons. With so much steel, 30,000 square meters of general reinforced concrete structure factory buildings can be built, 20,000 square meters of machine factory buildings with ten-ton cranes can be built, 313 Type 35 tracked tractors (each weighing 3,700 kg) can be manufactured, or 21 kilometers of railway can be laid with 27 kg/m track. If all construction units in the country calculate this account, the situation of wasting steel will be even more alarming.

    In addition, the waste of copper materials is also very serious. For example, we can see copper products everywhere in many buildings, such as latches, handles, door locks, clothes hooks, window stays, etc., and even small water valves, shut-off valves, and fire hydrants below 50 mm are made of copper. If the above-mentioned utensils can be made of alloy, bakelite, ceramic, malleable iron, and other materials, it is estimated that at least 10,000 tons of copper can be saved in the construction of houses nationwide every year. We have trial-produced a batch of water nozzles, small shut-off valves, and other finished products with malleable iron. After trial use, there are no major shortcomings. In order to save copper materials, it is hoped that the departments manufacturing hardware parts will conduct more research and trial-manufacture substitutes for copper, so as to save a large amount of copper for use in other industries.

    As for the phenomenon of wasting metal materials in construction, it is also serious. On construction sites, there are many rebar ends, pipe heads, iron wires, nails, small hardware parts, and slightly defective water nozzles and shut-off valves that are randomly discarded, buried in soil, and crushed by bricks everywhere. For example, the construction site in front of our building has been completed for a long time, but we can constantly see rebar ends, iron wires, and other materials buried halfway in the ground. If we can thoroughly check and count the metal materials wasted due to poor management on each construction site, that number would be very alarming.

    Therefore, our designers should pay special attention to reducing the amount of steel and other metal materials used when conducting various standard designs and house construction designs, and try to use local materials as much as possible. We have compared several standard dormitories. Compared with the use of seven-room units and five-room units, hard mountain purlins (this structure is relatively backward) and hollow brick partitions, each 10,000 square meters of building can only save 14.2 tons of rebar when using five-room units. If seven-room units are used, 50 tons of rebar can be saved, and 20 cubic meters of wood can be saved. The disadvantage of hard mountain purlins is that each living room is 0.72 square meters smaller than a hollow brick partition. The seven-room unit is designed with two households sharing a seven-meter corridor, but if one household needs one corridor, it can also be separated into one household and one door. If the load-bearing hollow brick and large brick blocks suitable for our country's current use can be successfully researched, the annual savings figure will be considerable. Our designers should consider these issues when considering each architectural design. At the same time, it is recommended that relevant departments strengthen the management of building materials, and promptly study and formulate the structural types and material consumption quotas that should be adopted for various buildings, which should be uniformly controlled and rationally allocated by design, approval, allocation, and other relevant agencies, and constantly pay attention to saving important metal materials and resolutely oppose the behavior of wasting metal materials.

    厉行节约，反对基本建设中的浪费！
    不要浪费金属材料
    城市建设总局城市设计院副院长　李荫蓬
    我们都知道，没有钢不能盖起现代化的厂房，不能造出机械，不能建筑黄河和长江大桥，不能改造农业生产。总之，离开钢是不可能建成重工业，实现社会主义工业化的。
    但是，我们有不少的建筑本来可以多用砖石，却大量使用了钢材。如我们设计的工程学院的办公楼、俱乐部、图书馆的建筑面积计二万七千一百零四平方公尺。因为强调主楼（办公楼）不但要和过去盖的宫殿式大顶子的楼房相衬，而且要比去年盖的配房还要壮丽，以表现出主楼的气派，因此就在一万七千七百二十五平方公尺的五层办公楼中间，设计上有重檐的宫殿式大顶子。在两翼四层的平顶上，一边设计一个城楼式的亭子，其面积共为一千零四十平方公尺。在大顶子的下层，都用框架结构。俱乐部和图书馆也是用钢制成的房架。基础全部要用钢筋混凝土灌制。在技术设计时，我们进行了一次概算，只钢材一项：办公楼的基础约需九十七公吨；大顶子和框架、梁、板、柱等约需二百五十八公吨；俱乐部、图书馆的基础和地下室约需一百三十八公吨；房架约需一百一十四公吨；梁、板、柱等约需一百五十二公吨。总计要用钢材七百五十九公吨。学了赫鲁晓夫同志在全苏建筑工作者会议上的报告和建筑工程部二月会议的精神后，我们检查了在设计中的浪费并进行了修改。现将大顶子改为平顶，基础改为毛石混凝土，框架结构改为混合结构，图书馆的钢房架改为木房架，就约计可少用钢材三百七十四公吨（电梯及其他钢材尚未计入），可节省总造价四十万元以上。
    又如我们去年给南苑宿舍区设计供暖设备时，宿舍共四十一幢，建筑面积十一万七千七百平方公尺，占地面积四万一千零四十六平方公尺，供暖管线最远距离九百公尺。原设计是用八台钢板锅炉的蒸汽供暖设备。在我们学习苏联先进经验，改用铸铁锅炉单管顺序强制循环热水供暖试成后，就可省去八台钢板锅炉的钢材一百七十六公吨，缩小锅炉房面积三百六十平方公尺，可节省造价三十三万八千二百元。
    据我们了解，类似这样浪费钢材的现象，在其他建筑设计单位也是有的。如北京地安门那两幢豪华的机关宿舍。建筑面积四万二千一百一十平方公尺，钢门钢窗用的钢材约为二百公吨，六个大顶子就用掉钢筋三十六公吨，挑檐、女儿墙、阳台、梁、板、柱等约用钢筋六百二十三公吨，地下室和基础用钢材十一公吨。另外，内有电梯八部，约需钢材二十八公吨。总计用钢材八百九十八公吨。而一般混合结构的五层楼房所需钢材只不过四百五十公吨，这两幢楼就浪费了四百四十八公吨钢材。据工地负责同志谈，去年开工时，他们已经提议将原设计用的安全系数二，降为一点八，就可节省钢筋三十公吨。如将供暖用的六台钢板锅炉，改为生铁锅炉，约可省钢材一百二十八公吨。否则，如全按原设计建成就要浪费钢材六百零六公吨。
    仅就上述三项建筑或设计所浪费的钢材就共计是一千一百五十六公吨。用这样多的钢材，可建筑一般的钢筋混凝土结构的厂房三万平方公尺，可建筑有十吨吊车的机工厂房两万平方公尺，可制造三五型链轨式拖拉机（每部三千七百公斤）三百一十三部，如做成二七公斤公尺型的道轨可铺二十一公里铁路。如果全国各建筑单位都来算一下这笔账，那浪费钢材的情况，一定会更惊人了。
    另外，铜料的浪费情况也很严重。如我们在许多建筑物中随处都可以看到铜制的东西，如插稍、拉手、门锁、衣勾、窗撑等等，甚至五十公厘以下的小水门、截门和消火栓等，也都是用铜制的。如能把上述这些用具，改用合金、胶木、陶瓷、马铁等材料制做，估计在全国每年的建筑房舍中，最少可节省铜料一万公吨。我们曾用马铁试制了一批水嘴、小截门等成品，经试用，没有什么大的缺点。为了能达到节省铜材，希望有关制造五金零件的部门，应多研究和试造铜的代用品，以便把大批铜料节省下来用于其他工业中去。
    至于在施工方面浪费金属材料的现象，也是严重的。在工地上有不少的钢筋梢、管头、铁丝、钉子、小五金零件、以及稍有毛病的水嘴、截门等乱抛乱掷，土埋砖压，到处都是。如我们楼前的工地，早已完工，但在地上可以不断地看到埋了半截的钢筋梢、铁丝等材料。如能把每个建筑工地上，由于管理不善所浪费的金属材料很好地检查统计出来，那个数字会是很惊人的。
    因此，我们设计人员在进行各种标准设计和房屋修建设计时，应特别注意减少钢材和其他金属材料的用量，并尽量利用当地材料。我们曾拿几个标准宿舍做过比较，以采用七间单元和五间单元、硬山搁檩（这种结构是比较落后的）和空心砖隔断比较，每一万平方公尺建筑，用五间单元只能节省钢筋十四点二公吨，如用七间单元即可省钢筋五十公吨，并可省木材二十立方公尺。硬山搁檩的缺点是每个居住房间比空心砖隔断小零点七二平方公尺。七间单元是按两户共用一个七公尺的走廊设计的，但如需一户一廊时，也可隔开成为一户一门。如将空心砖承重和适于我国目前用的大型砖砌块研究成功，那每年的节约数字是很可观的。我们设计人员在考虑每个建筑设计时，应考虑到这些问题。同时，建议有关部门，应加强建筑材料的管理工作，迅速研究制定各种建筑应采用的结构类型和用料定额，由设计、批审、调拨等有关机关统一掌握，合理调配，经常注意节省重要的金属材料，坚决反对浪费金属材料的行为。
