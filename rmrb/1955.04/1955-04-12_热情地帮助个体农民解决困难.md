    Enthusiastically Help Individual Farmers Solve Difficulties
    In Ge Tiaogang Township, Changli County, Hebei Province, more than twenty individual farmer households lack labor and livestock, facing many difficulties in spring plowing and production. When discussing the township's overall production plan for this year, the township Party General Branch Committee focused on studying this issue and summarized the experience of solving the difficulties of impoverished individual farmers in 1954. In the summer of 1954, the township branch mobilized various agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams to help individual farmers with difficulties in reclaiming wasteland, enabling forty-seven individual farmer households to achieve a bumper harvest. Individual farmers received profound education from this, and after the autumn, forty-four households joined agricultural cooperatives. The General Branch Committee decided to draw on this experience and mobilize agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams to continue helping impoverished individual farmers overcome the difficulties in spring plowing and sowing.

    The General Branch Committee immediately convened meetings of Party members and the masses to discuss this issue. Some people raised different opinions. Party member Li Xiushan believed that if individual farmers are helped whenever they have difficulties, they will not want to take the path of mutual aid and cooperation in the future. Cooperative member Ye Liming proposed charging two yuan for helping individual farmers plow one mu of land. After analyzing and studying these ideological situations, the General Branch immediately mobilized everyone to discuss: what are the benefits of helping individual farmers for ensuring the comprehensive completion of the production plan, for the country, and for individuals; what consequences will discrimination against individual farmers produce; how to guide individual farmers to take the path of mutual aid and cooperation, and other issues. The General Branch also led everyone to study the passage in the CCP Central Committee's resolution on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation regarding the need to care for and take care of individual farmers. After such discussion and study, everyone agreed that individual farmers should be helped. The General Branch then held a meeting to study and determine various specific measures to help individual farmers with their work. With the help of the agricultural cooperatives, these impoverished farmers actively carried out manure collecting and delivery work. (Liu Jiulong)

    热情地帮助个体农民解决困难
    河北省昌黎县葛条港乡有二十多户个体农民缺乏劳动力和牲畜，春耕生产中困难很多。这个乡的党总支委员会在讨论今年全乡生产计划时，着重研究了这个问题，并总结了一九五四年解决贫困个体农民困难的经验。一九五四年夏季，乡支部发动各农业社和互助组帮助有困难的个体农民抢荒，使四十七户个体农民的庄稼都得到了丰收。从这里个体农民受到了深刻的教育，秋后，就有四十四户加入了农业社。总支委员会决定吸取这一经验，发动农业社和互助组继续帮助贫困的个体农民克服春耕播种中的困难。
    总支委员会即分别召开党员和群众会议讨论这个问题。有些人提出了不同的意见。党员李秀山认为现在个体农民一有困难就帮助他们，将来他们就不想走互助合作的道路了。社员叶立明提出帮助个体农民耕一亩地要两元报酬。总支分析研究了这些思想情况后，立即发动大家讨论：帮助个体农民对保证全面完成生产计划、对国家和个人有什么好处；歧视个体农民会产生什么结果；如何引导个体农民走互助合作道路等问题。总支又领导大家学习了中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议中关于应该关心和照顾个体农民的那段话。经过这样的讨论学习，大家都同意应该帮助个体农民。总支又开会研究确定了帮助个体农民干活的各项具体办法。这些贫困农民在农业社的帮助下，积极进行捣粪、送粪工作。　（刘九龙）
