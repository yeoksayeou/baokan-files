Editor's Note: Since this newspaper exposed the child abuse by the Ming Dejun couple, a large number of readers have written letters expressing their extreme anger at the cruel crimes of the Ming Dejun couple. In addition to demanding that relevant leaders seriously handle this matter, they also proposed to educate the people to care more about children, educate children, and be responsible for nurturing our second generation. As of April 1, we have received 1,478 letters. We have selected a few to publish below.
Responsible for nurturing the new generation, opposing child abuse
How much blood has been shed to protect children?
Comrades Editors:
We are people's soldiers. To protect the motherland, protect our hometown, and protect the happy childhood of our children, we have experienced countless arduous struggles and shed countless blood! Therefore, after we saw "Accusation of the Ming Dejun Couple's Cruel Crime of Child Abuse," we couldn't help but feel angry.
We clearly remember how the volunteer Luo Shengjiao, in the freezing winter, sacrificed his own life and jumped into the ice hole to save the Korean boy Cui Peng. This glorious deed not only taught us to further study the great internationalist spirit of Comrade Luo Shengjiao and fight to the end for the cause of the liberation of all mankind, but also educated the broad masses of people across the country to care more about children and love children more.
Protecting children and enabling them to grow up in a peaceful and happy environment and become talents for building communism is one of our sacred responsibilities. As protectors of children, we will never allow Ming Dejun and Yang Shulan to treat children in such an inhumane way. We request that the relevant authorities deal with Ming Dejun and Yang Shulan, who have failed to fulfill their responsibilities as parents and have lost their communist morality.

It is great joy to take care of children
Comrades Editors:
Children are the masters of the country, our future, and our hope. Therefore, we always try our best to rescue and care for premature babies weighing only about 1,300 grams. When we rescue or raise a child weighing about three pounds, we always feel great joy, because we know that this is adding strength to the future communist construction of the motherland. However, Ming Dejun and Yang Shulan are exactly the opposite of us. Not only did they not fulfill their responsibilities as parents, but they also destroyed the second generation of the country. We feel extremely indignant at this crime, and we resolutely oppose this inhumane behavior and fight to defend the rights of children.

Abusing children is by no means a minor matter of life
Comrades Editors:
After reading "Accusation of the Ming Dejun Couple's Cruel Crime of Child Abuse" published on the reader's letter page on March 27, my emotions have not been able to calm down for a long time. As a mother of three children, I am writing to you to make my request. I request that the relevant authorities seriously deal with this inhumane criminal behavior of the Ming Dejun couple.
This incident reminds me of how I view my children. I have always loved my children, especially after participating in revolutionary work. Under the education of the Party, I know that children are the next generation of our revolution, builders of communism, and belong to our country. I pay more attention to how to correctly educate my children so that they can truly become heirs to our great cause of building socialism in the future. I have infinite feelings for my children. When I come home from work every day, seeing my children's red little faces fills me with comfort and joy, and the fatigue of the day disappears invisibly. When I encounter difficulties in my work and feel disheartened, as long as I think of my lovely children, I think: We must build a socialist society and create a happy life for our children and other thousands of children. Thinking of this, my whole body is filled with infinite power. Sometimes I also scold my children, but I regret it very much afterwards, thinking: What do children know? We should patiently educate children and slowly persuade them; scolding not only cannot solve the problem, but also has a bad influence on the formation of children's character. I have also seen many other female cadres who treat their children with the same maternal love and responsibility. But why is Yang Shulan so barbaric? They used inhumane means to treat their children, kicking them under the bed, driving them out into the freezing cold to suffer... Even ordinary people cannot tolerate such mistakes, let alone that they are revolutionary cadres and Ming Dejun is still a communist. Their bad behavior is not only morally unacceptable, but also has a very bad political impact among the masses. As the saying goes, "Even a tiger does not eat its cubs," but the Ming Dejun couple is more vicious than tigers and wolves. Why doesn't the relevant authority seriously deal with them? Ming Dejun and Yang Shulan treat their own children so cruelly, how would they treat other people's children? As their neighbors said: "They are so cold and ruthless to their own children, who can believe that they can have any feelings for the masses and the revolutionary cause?" We ask the relevant authorities not to treat the problem of child abuse as a "minor matter of life" or a "personal" problem. The life problems of revolutionaries are inseparable from their attitude towards the revolutionary cause.

We must cultivate children into lively and healthy people
Comrades Editors:
Everyone should care for and love children, because they are the future of the motherland and the heirs of the revolutionary predecessors.
We hope to educate children to become honest, lively, brave, and physically sound people. Therefore, we oppose spoiling children, but we oppose even more the barbaric, concentration camp-style management methods of the Ming Dejun couple. We want to tell the Ming Dejun couple: Children are not your private property, not objects that you can arbitrarily destroy. She belongs to the country. The motherland entrusted you with the glorious and sacred responsibility of raising children, and it is by no means to "discipline" her into a useless person or an idiot.
I used to be an instructor for the Young Pioneers. Although my work was not done well, when I found that the new qualities of the team members were growing day by day, when I saw the team members playing happily and studying hard, I could not help but feel excited and proud. Their future is so beautiful and happy, their future is so bright and promising, who can not feel happy, who can not bless them! But the Ming Dejun couple shamefully treated their children as their own private property and punching bags: they took off her clothes and punished her by freezing, spitting saliva into her mouth... Such barbaric behavior is not allowed to exist in our society. We want to loudly call out: Let people throughout society cherish and educate our second generation and stop such incidents from happening!

### 负责抚养新的一代，反对虐待孩子

专栏：

    编者按：本报揭发了名德俊夫妇虐待孩子的事件后，广大读者纷纷来信对名德俊夫妇的残忍罪行表示极大的愤怒。他们除了要求有关领导方面严正处理这一事件以外，还提出要教育人民更加关心儿童，教育儿童，负责抚养我们的第二代。截至四月一日止，我们已收到来信一千四百七十八件。现选出几篇发表在后面。
    负责抚养新的一代，反对虐待孩子
    为保卫儿童不知流了多少鲜血编辑同志：
    我们是人民的战士，为了保卫祖国，保卫家乡，保卫孩子们幸福的童年生活，我们不知经历了多少艰苦斗争，不知流了多少鲜血！因此，当我们看到“控诉名德俊夫妇虐待孩子的残忍罪行”之后，不由得我们不气愤填膺。
    我们清楚的记得，志愿军罗盛教烈士是怎样在冰天雪地的严冬里，不惜牺牲自己的生命，跳入冰窟，救起了朝鲜少年崔?。这一光辉事迹，不但教育了我们要更进一步地学习罗盛教烈士的伟大的国际主义精神，为全人类的解放事业而奋斗到底，而且也教育全国广大的人民群众更加关心儿童、更加热爱儿童。
    保卫儿童，使儿童能在和平幸福的环境里成长起来，成为建设共产主义的人材，是我们神圣的职责之一。作为儿童的保卫者，我们决不容许名德俊、杨淑兰这样极不人道地虐待儿童。要求有关机关对没有负起做父母的责任、丧失了共产主义道德的名德俊、杨淑兰予以处理。中国人民解放军战士曹培林　沈剑华周大宽　张惠民等护理好孩子是莫大的快乐编辑同志：
    儿童是国家的主人翁，是我们的未来，是我们的希望。因此，我们对于体重仅仅一千三百公分左右的早产婴儿，总是千方百计地抢救着、护理着。当我们救活或哺育好一个三斤左右的小孩时，我们总感到莫大的快乐，因为我们知道，这就是给祖国未来的共产主义建设增加了一分力量。但是名德俊、杨淑兰却恰恰和我们相反，他们不但没有负起作父母的责任，反而摧残国家的第二代。我们对这种罪行感到极端愤慨，我们坚决反对这种不人道的行为，为维护儿童的权利而斗争。
                医务工作者
                  齐婉如　钱淑珍　张雅琴虐待孩子决不是生活小节编辑同志：
    我看了三月二十七日读者来信专页上所刊的“控诉名德俊夫妇虐待孩子的残忍罪行”一文后，感情很久都不能够平静，我作为一个三个孩子的母亲，来向你们提出我的请求，我要求有关机关严肃处理名德俊夫妇的这种不人道的犯罪行为。
    从这件事使我联想到我是如何看待我的孩子的。我从来就热爱我的孩子，尤其是参加革命工作以后，在党的教育下，使我知道孩子是我们革命的后一代，是共产主义的建设者，是属于我们国家所有的，我更注意到应该如何正确的教育我的孩子，使他们将来能真正成为我们建设社会主义的伟大的事业的继承人。我对待孩子有无限的情感，当我每日工作完毕回家时，一看见孩子红红的小脸，心里就充满着安慰和愉快，一天的疲劳就无形的消失了。当我在工作中碰到困难而感到灰心丧气时，只要一想到我那几个可爱的孩子，就想到：咱们要建设社会主义社会，要创造美满幸福的生活，就是为着咱们的孩子和其他千千万万的孩子。一想到这点，全身就充满了无限的力量。有时我也骂孩子，但事后非常懊悔，想到：孩子懂得什么呢？应该对孩子耐心进行教育，慢慢地说服他们；采取骂的办法不但不能解决问题，而且对孩子性格的形成会起着不好的影响的。我还看见其他许多女干部，对待孩子同样充满着母爱和责任感。但杨淑兰却为什么会野蛮到如此地步？他们竟用不人道的手段来对待自己的孩子，将她踢到床底下、将她赶到冰天雪地里去受冻……。就是普通群众犯了这样的错误都是不能容忍的，何况他们还是革命干部，名德俊还是一个共产党员。他们这种恶劣的行为不但在人道上说不过去，而且在群众中造成了很坏的政治影响。俗语说：“虎毒不食子”，但名德俊夫妇比虎狼还要毒辣，有关机关为什么不加以严肃的处理？名德俊、杨淑兰对待自己的孩子如此残忍，对待别人的孩子会如何呢？正如他们邻居所说的：“他们对于自己亲生的孩子竟然这样冷酷无情，谁能相信他们对待群众和革命事业能有什么感情呢？”我们要求有关机关不要再将虐待孩子的问题当成“生活小节”，当成“个人”问题，革命者的生活问题是和对待革命事业的态度分不开的。
                  北京市东罗圈十三号　梅子要把儿童养成活泼健全的人编辑同志：
    每一个人都应该关怀和爱护儿童，因为他们是祖国的未来，是革命先辈的继承人。
    我们希望把儿童教育成为一个诚实、活泼、勇敢和体格健全的人。因而我们反对溺爱儿女，但是更反对名德俊夫妇那种野蛮的，集中营式的管教方法。我们要正告名德俊夫妇：孩子不是你们的私产，不是你们可以任意摧残的对象。她是属于国家的，祖国把教养儿女这种光荣的、神圣的责任交给你们，决不是要你们把她“管教”成为一个废人或呆子。
    我做过少先队的辅导员，虽然我的工作做的不好，但是当我发现队员们新的品质一天天成长起来的时候，当我看到队员们欢乐的玩耍和努力学习的时候，我不能不感到兴奋和骄傲。他们的未来是那样的美好幸福，他们的前途是那样的光明远大，谁能不感到快乐，谁能不为他们祝福！可是名德俊夫妇却可耻地把孩子作为自己的私有物和出气包：把她脱光了衣服罚冻，向她嘴里吐唾沫……。在我们的社会里，是不容许这样的野蛮行为存在的。我们要大声疾呼：让全社会的人都来爱护和教育我们的第二代，制止这类事件的发生！黄龙
