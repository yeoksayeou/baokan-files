The Road to Resolving the Austrian Question
　　Xu Ziqing

　　In order to expedite the resolution of the Austrian State Treaty issue, the Soviet government has recently made a series of new efforts. Following several meetings between Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Austrian Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bischoff in February and March of this year, the Soviet government formally invited Austrian Chancellor Raab on March 24 to Moscow to discuss issues related to the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty. On March 26, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, reiterated the proposal to hold a four-power conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France in the near future to resolve the Austrian State Treaty issue. Austrian Chancellor Raab and others have decided to accept the Soviet invitation and will travel to Moscow on April 11 to hold talks with the Soviet government.

　　The Soviet government's efforts on the Austrian State Treaty issue have been widely welcomed by international fair-minded public opinion, especially Austrian public opinion. Public opinion in various countries believes that the Soviet government's efforts have once again opened the road to the Austrian State Treaty and have once again demonstrated the Soviet Union's efforts to resolve outstanding international issues.

　　However, the governments of Western countries, which have been smearing the Soviet Union for obstructing the resolution of the Austrian issue, have adopted a cold attitude towards this new constructive effort made by the Soviet Union to resolve the Austrian issue. US Secretary of State Dulles publicly stated on March 29: "The Austrian government cannot negotiate with the Soviet Union for a separate solution or enter into any agreement with Russia without the consent of other occupying countries." However, when it came to the possibility of holding a four-power conference with the Soviet Union to discuss the Austrian State Treaty issue, he procrastinated and said: "It is almost certain that it will be several months later." As for what will happen in a few months, Dulles did not make any clear guarantees. This shows that the American aggressor bloc is determined to continue to delay the resolution of the Austrian issue.

　　It has been nearly ten years since the end of the war in Europe, and the Austrian State Treaty has not yet been concluded. This is the result of the consistent obstructionist policy adopted by the United States, Britain, and France.

　　After the four-power foreign ministers' deputies meeting to discuss the Austrian State Treaty issue began in January 1947, thanks to the unremitting efforts of the Soviet Union, which overcame the numerous obstacles created by the West, an agreement was reached on the vast majority of the main clauses of the draft treaty by 1949. However, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France continued to obstruct and delay, and in March 1952, they put forward a so-called "Brief Treaty on Austria" draft unilaterally drafted by the three countries. This "Brief Treaty" revoked extremely important clauses that had already been agreed upon, including: clauses concerning the basic democratic rights of the Austrian people, clauses concerning the eradication of Nazism from Austrian political, economic, and cultural life, clauses concerning Austria's establishment of self-defense armed forces, and clauses concerning the Soviet Union's rights to former German assets. The aim of the "Brief Treaty" proposed by the United States, Britain, and France was obviously to deprive Austria of its independence and prevent Austria from seeking development on the road of peace and democracy. Under the resolute opposition of the Soviet Union, the Western countries later had to withdraw this absurd so-called "Brief Treaty" draft. However, in this way, the negotiations on the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty were shelved for nearly two years due to the Western countries' extraneous actions.

　　The American aggressor bloc and its British and French partners are doing their utmost to obstruct the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty because they are determined to turn Austria into a war outpost for the Western aggressor bloc to attack the Soviet Union and the Eastern European People's Democracies. Since the end of the war, the United States has been accelerating its plan to militarize the US, British, and French occupied zones in Austria, while obstructing the signing of the Austrian State Treaty. Since 1948, the United States has built the area near Salzburg into a military zone. The United States also violated the four-power agreement by sending American troops to Tyrol in the French occupied zone. According to Western European bourgeois newspapers, the Atlantic aggressor bloc is preparing to build the so-called "Central Alps" area in Tyrol into a "mountain fortress," establishing a series of airports, underground factories, gun emplacements, and radar station networks. The British "Economist" magazine, in reporting on the US military preparations in Austria, said that the possibility of militarizing the Salzburg area and building jet fighter airports within effective range of the Balkans is a factor that cannot be ignored. The New York "Herald Tribune" even openly stated that if the United States can maintain these forward bases for a long time, it may conquer the entire Southeast Europe. According to its plan to prepare for a new war, the United States also intends to openly drag Austria into the Western aggressor bloc and establish a mercenary army of ten divisions in Austria, commanded by the European Command of the North Atlantic Group.

　　At the same time, as the United States and its followers are stepping up the plan to revive militarism in West Germany, the danger of "German-Austrian merger" has also greatly increased. Encouraged by the US-British aggressor bloc, West German revanchists have openly talked about their plan to re-annex Austria. Kaiser, the Minister for All-German Affairs of the Adenauer government, said at the conference of the Austrian ruling party that Austria, together with Alsace-Lorraine and part of Switzerland, should be incorporated into the so-called Germanic group. With the support of the United States, West German monopoly capital also demanded the return of so-called "German assets"—including Austrian assets looted by Hitler elements after the annexation of Austria in 1938—in order to economically establish the basis for the German-Austrian merger. West German militarists are also using organizations such as the so-called "Soldiers' Association" and "Comrades' Association," composed of former Nazi officers in Austria, to carry out coordinated activities in Austria. It can be seen that the US-British aggressor bloc's plan to delay the Austrian State Treaty and attempt to turn Austria into a military base for the Western aggressor bloc seriously threatens Austria's independence and security and endangers European peace.

　　Therefore, at the four-power foreign ministers' conference held in Berlin in January 1954, Foreign Minister Molotov suggested that the draft Austrian State Treaty must stipulate that Austria should guarantee not to participate in any military group aimed at opposing any country that had sent troops to participate in the war against Germany and the war to liberate Austria. Austria must not allow the establishment of foreign military bases on its territory. At the same time, the four countries must take corresponding measures to prevent new German-Austrian merger conspiracies. The Soviet Union's proposals are in line with the interests of the Austrian people and with the interests of the security and peace of European countries, but they were rejected by the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France. In his report on the international situation and the diplomatic policy of the Soviet government in February this year, and in his talks with Austrian Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bischoff on February 25 and March 2, Foreign Minister Molotov reiterated the above-mentioned propositions on the Austrian State Treaty, and pointed out that the withdrawal of the four-power armies from Austria does not have to wait until after the conclusion of the German State Treaty, but the four countries should reach an agreement on corresponding measures sufficient to rule out the possibility of Germany implementing a new German-Austrian merger. The Austrian government replied to the Soviet government on March 14, agreeing with satisfaction with the Soviet Union's views. The Austrian government's note stated: "The Federal Government welcomes any effective guarantee and guarantee for Austria's independence and freedom to prevent any infringement, and thus also prevent the danger of German-Austrian merger"; "Austria does not intend to participate in military alliances, nor does it intend to allow the establishment of military bases on its territory"; the Austrian government believes that "a meeting of all relevant countries with Austrian participation can find a final solution to the Austrian question. ... Discussions on the Austrian State Treaty by the four major powers alone with Austrian participation will lead to the successful conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty."

　　In this way, the Soviet government's recent new efforts have created new and favorable conditions for resolving the Austrian issue without delay in accordance with the interests of maintaining and consolidating European peace. If the Western countries are truly sincere in resolving the Austrian issue and promoting the easing of international tensions, they should agree to convene a four-power conference as soon as possible on the favorable basis of the Soviet Union's new initiative and conclude the Austrian State Treaty at an early date to restore the full independence of democratic Austria, instead of continuing to find various excuses to delay and obstruct the talks as they are doing now.

    解决奥地利问题的道路
    徐子青
    苏联政府为了迅速解决对奥和约问题，最近连续作了一连串新的努力。今年二三月间，苏联莫洛托夫外长和奥地利驻苏大使比萧夫进行了多次接触之后，苏联政府在三月二十四日正式邀请奥国总理拉布到莫斯科去商讨同缔结对奥和约有关的问题。三月二十六日，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁并重申在最近的将来举行苏、美、英、法四国会议以解决对奥和约问题的建议。奥地利总理拉布等已决定接受苏联的邀请，将于四月十一日前往莫斯科同苏联政府举行会谈。
    苏联政府在对奥和约问题上的努力受到了国际公正舆论，特别是奥地利舆论的广泛欢迎。各国舆论认为，苏联政府的这种努力已再一次打开了通往对奥和约的道路，并又一次证明苏联努力争取解决悬而未决的国际问题。
    但是，一直在诬蔑苏联阻挠奥地利问题解决的西方国家政府对苏联为解决奥地利问题所作的这种新的建设性努力，却又采取了冷淡的态度。美国国务卿杜勒斯三月二十九日公开说：“奥地利政府不能不经其他占领国家同意而同苏联谈判以求单独的解决或同俄国订立任何协议。”可是谈到同苏联举行四国会谈讨论对奥和约问题的可能，他又推宕说：“几乎可以肯定地说，要过几个月以后。”至于几个月后又如何，杜勒斯没有作出任何明确的保证。这就表明了美国侵略集团存心要继续拖延奥地利问题的解决。
    欧洲的战争结束已近十年，对奥和约至今还没有缔结，就是美、英、法三国一贯采取阻挠政策的结果。
    讨论对奥和约问题的四国外长助理会议在一九四七年一月开始举行以后，由于苏联方面坚持不渝的努力，克服了西方制造的重重障碍，在一九四九年已对和约草案的绝大部分主要条款达成了协议。但是美、英、法三国政府进行了继续的阻挠和拖延，并在一九五二年三月提出了三国片面草拟的所谓“对奥简要条约”草案。这个“简要条约”撤销了原来已经协议的极为重要的条款，包括：有关奥地利人民基本民主权利的条款，有关从奥地利政治、经济和文化生活中根除纳粹主义的条款，有关奥地利建立自卫武装的条款，以及有关苏联对前德国资产的权利的条款等。美、英、法三国提出的“简要和约”的目的，显然是要剥夺奥地利的独立，并使奥地利不能在和平民主的道路上谋求发展。在苏联的坚决反对下，西方国家后来才不得不撤回这个荒谬的所谓“简要条约”草案。但是这样一来，关于缔结对奥和约的谈判就因为西方国家的这种横生枝节的做法而被搁置了将近两年之久。
    美国侵略集团及其英法伙伴，所以竭力阻挠对奥和约的缔结，是因为它们一心想把奥地利变成为西方侵略集团进攻苏联和东欧人民民主国家的战争前哨。战后以来，美国一面阻挠对奥和约的签订，一面加紧在奥地利的美、英、法占领区中实行军事基地化的计划。自一九四八年起，美国就把萨尔斯堡附近的地区建成为一个军事区域。美国还违反四国协议，派遣美国部队驻扎到法占区的蒂罗尔去。据西欧资产阶级报纸透露，大西洋侵略集团正准备将蒂罗尔一带所谓“中阿尔卑斯山区”修筑成为“高山要塞”，建立一系列的飞机场、地下工厂、炮台和雷达站网。英国“经济学人”杂志在报道美国在奥地利进行军事准备工作时曾说，使萨尔斯堡地区军事化和在对巴尔干有效航程之内修建喷气式战斗机机场的可能性，是不可被忽视的因素。纽约“先驱论坛报”更公开说，如果美国能长期保持这些前进基地，或许将征服整个东南欧洲。按照它的准备新战争的计划，美国并企图把奥地利公开拉入西方侵略集团，在奥地利建立一支拥有十个师的、由北大西洋集团欧洲司令部指挥的雇佣军。
    同时，由于美国及其追随者在西德加紧推行复活军国主义的计划，还大大增加了“德奥合并”的危险。在美英侵略集团鼓励之下，西德复仇主义者已公开谈论他们重新吞并奥地利的计划了。阿登纳政府的全德事务部长凯撒在奥地利执政党的大会上就说过：奥地利，连同阿尔萨斯—洛林和瑞士的一部分，应该并入所谓日耳曼集团。在美国的支持之下，西德垄断资本也要求归还所谓“德国资产”——其中包括一九三八年并吞奥地利以后希特勒分子所掠夺的奥地利资产——以便在经济上奠立德奥合并的基础。西德军国主义者并利用奥地利的前纳粹军官所组成的所谓“军人联合会”、“同志联合会”等组织在奥地利进行配合的活动。由此可见，美英侵略集团拖延对奥和约，企图把奥地利变为西方侵略集团的军事基地的计划，严重地威胁奥地利的独立和安全，也危害欧洲和平。
    因此，在一九五四年一月在柏林举行的四国外长会议上，莫洛托夫外长建议对奥和约草案中必须规定：奥地利应保证不参加任何旨在反对任何曾经派遣军队参加对德战争和解放奥地利的战争的国家的军事集团。奥地利也不得允许在其领土上建立外国军事基地。同时四国必须采取相应的措施以防止新的德奥合并的阴谋。苏联的建议是既符合奥地利人民的利益、又符合欧洲各国安全与和平的利益的，但是却为美英法三国外长所拒绝。莫洛托夫外长在今年二月在关于国际局势和苏联政府的外交政策的报告中，以及在二月二十五日和三月二日和奥地利驻苏大使比萧夫会谈时，重申了关于对奥和约的上述主张，并指出，四国军队从奥地利撤退不必等到缔结对德和约之后，但是四国应该就足以排除德国实行新的德奥合并的可能性的大家同意的相应措施取得协议。奥地利政府三月十四日复照苏联政府，满意地同意苏联的意见。奥地利政府的照会中说：“联邦政府欢迎对奥地利的独立和自由的任何有效的保障和保证，以防止任何方面的侵犯，因而也防止德奥合并的危险”；“奥地利不打算参加军事联盟，也不打算允许在它的领土上建立军事基地”；奥地利政府相信，“所有有关国家举行一次有奥地利参加的会议是能够求得奥地利问题的最后解决的。……在奥地利参加下由四大国单独讨论对奥和约会导致顺利缔结对奥和约。”
    这样，苏联政府最近的新努力，已为毫不拖延地按照维持和巩固欧洲和平的利益来解决奥地利问题，创造了新的有利条件，西方国家如果真是有诚意解决奥地利问题，促进国际紧张局势的缓和，就应该同意在苏联新的倡议的有利基础上迅速召开四国会议，早日缔结对奥和约，恢复民主奥地利的完全独立，而不是像它们现在这样继续寻找种种借口来拖延和阻挠会谈。
