April 28, 1955

We are now about to leave the beautiful capital of the Republic of Indonesia. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to His Excellency President Sukarno, the government and people of the Republic of Indonesia. During our visit, we were deeply moved by the warm welcome and cordial reception given to us by the government and people of the Republic of Indonesia. This enthusiasm and sincerity fully demonstrates the friendship between our two peoples.

During the visit, the Prime Ministers of the Republic of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China held talks on various issues concerning the enhancement of friendly relations between the two countries and the promotion of world peace, and a joint statement is about to be issued. I believe that the talks and joint statement between the two Prime Ministers are in line with the common interests of the two peoples and are also an important contribution to the implementation of the unanimous resolutions reached at the Asian-African Conference.

Although the visit of the delegation of the People's Republic of China to the Republic of Indonesia was very short, it left a very deep impression. The enthusiasm and wisdom of the Indonesian people and their friendship towards the Chinese people will always remain in our memory. I congratulate the growing friendship between the Republic of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China, and I congratulate the two countries on achieving greater success in their friendly cooperation for the cause of world peace.

Goodbye!
