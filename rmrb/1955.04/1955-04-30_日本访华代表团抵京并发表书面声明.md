Xinhua News Agency, April 28th. The Japanese delegation, consisting of twenty-eight members led by the head of the delegation, Kinshi Yoshioka, and the deputy head, Yoshio Kobayashi, arrived in Beijing on the afternoon of the 28th, after attending the Asian Countries Conference and at the invitation of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace.

Representatives from the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the China Political Science and Law Society, the Chinese Medical Association, and religious figures went to the station to welcome them.

Also present at the station to welcome them were Japanese peace activists in Beijing, Kaneko Seki, Ganemon Nakamura, and others.

The head of the delegation, Kinshi Yoshioka, issued the following written statement upon arrival in Beijing:

The Japanese delegation attending the Asian Countries Conference, along with the Chinese delegation and other national delegations, achieved great success for the peace of Asia and the world. We feel very honored to have received the invitation from the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace after the conference.

The Chinese and Japanese people have had a deep friendship and amity since ancient times. However, in recent decades, Japanese militarists have carried out cruel aggression against Asia, especially against China. In the name of the peace-loving Japanese people, we sincerely apologize for this mistake.

We are deeply grateful for the meticulous hospitality extended to us by the Chinese people and their representatives during our journey from the border to Beijing, and we express our heartfelt thanks here.

We express our admiration for the Chinese people's arduous struggle under the leadership of Chairman Mao to drive out the aggressors and strive for freedom and independence, as well as for the great achievements they have made in peaceful construction.

We fully understand that the prerequisite for China's great construction was the long and arduous struggle for liberation.

During our journey from the border to Beijing, we have already learned a great deal from China's liberation struggle and peaceful construction, and we are prepared to learn even more in the future.

At present, Japan is under the rule of foreign militarists, and compared to the tragic situation in Japan, the joyous reality in China has given us much education and inspiration.

We hope to learn as much as possible from China in order to contribute to Japan's independence, world peace, and the friendship between Japan and China.

    从国境到北京的旅途中，我们蒙受了中国人民和他们的代表人士无微不至的招待，使我们实在感激不尽，在这里深深道谢。
    对于中国人民在毛主席的领导下，赶走侵略主义者，为争取自由和独立所进行的艰苦斗争以及在和平建设中所获得的伟大成绩，我们表示钦佩。
