Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 18th: According to a broadcast by All India Radio: Indian International Airlines issued a statement in Bombay on the 17th regarding the crash of the "Kashmir Princess" Constellation aircraft carrying personnel and journalists of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference. The statement said that reports have now been received from the three surviving crew members of the aircraft regarding the accident in which the aircraft crashed in the South China Sea on April 11 during its flight from Hong Kong to Jakarta. The statement said that the three crew members believe that the explosion and fire that caused the plane crash were due to external causes completely unrelated to the aircraft's own construction. The explosion and fire were not caused by any failure of any part of the aircraft itself, the engine, the fuel system, or other systems of the aircraft.

The statement quoted the three individuals' report as saying that when the plane was flying normally over the Natuna Islands, at approximately 4:53 pm local time, a sudden explosion was heard, and thick smoke immediately entered the cabin. A fire alarm went off in the luggage compartment, and fire extinguishers were immediately used to spray the luggage compartment, but to no avail. Then a raging fire started and quickly spread to the aircraft's right wing. At this time, the entire interior of the aircraft, including the cockpit, was filled with thick smoke. Captain Jatar decided to immediately land on the water. The descent and landing were carried out under unusually difficult circumstances. The plane hit the water rather violently and then sank almost immediately.

The statement said that the important thing is that up until the explosion and fire, the plane had been flying normally in all respects.

The statement concluded by saying that there is now no hope for the possible survival of any passengers or other crew members. Indian International Airlines expresses its deepest condolences to the families of all the passengers and crew members who died in this tragedy.

    印度国际航空公司就飞机坠毁事件发表声明
    生还的乘务人员报告飞机的爆炸和起火是外来原因造成的
    新华社新德里十八日电　据全印广播电台广播：印度国际航空公司十七日在孟买发表了关于出席亚非会议的中国代表团人员和记者乘坐的“克什米尔公主号”星座式飞机坠毁事件的声明。声明说，现在已经接到这架飞机上的三位生还的乘务人员就这架飞机于四月十一日从香港到雅加达的航程中在南中国海坠毁的事故提出的报告。声明说，这三个乘务人员认为，使飞机失事的爆炸和起火是由于同飞机本身的构造完全无关的外来的原因造成的。爆炸和起火并不是由于飞机本身的任何部分，引擎或燃料系统和飞机的其他系统失灵而引起的。
    声明引用这三个人的报告说，当这架飞机正在纳土纳岛附近上空正常飞行的时候，在当地时间下午四时五十三分光景，突然听到了一声爆炸声，浓烟随即进入机舱。行李间发出了火警的信号，于是立即打开灭火器向行李房内喷射，然而无效。接着烧起了一场烈火，并且迅速蔓延到飞机的右翼，这时整个飞机的内部，包括驾驶舱都布满了浓烟。机长贾塔尔决定立即在水上降落。下降和着陆是在异常困难的情况下进行的。飞机相当猛烈地碰到水面，接着几乎立即下沉。
    声明说，重要的事情是，截至爆炸和起火时为止，飞机在各方面都飞行得很正常。
    声明最后说，现在对任何旅客和其他乘务人员可能的生还，不能抱什么希望。印度国际航空公司对在这次悲剧中死亡的全体旅客和乘务人员的家属表示深切的慰问。
