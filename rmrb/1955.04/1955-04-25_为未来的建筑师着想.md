Thinking of Future Architects
		Mou Lan

Youth are the "flowers of the motherland's youth." However, these "flowers" need cultivation: not only must they be taught cultural and scientific knowledge, but they must also be constantly educated with socialist and communist ideas so that they grow healthily.

However, when I think of the situation in China's architectural circles in the past two years, I cannot help but sweat for some young people—future architects: What are they being taught? What examples are being left to them? Not to mention the actual work, or the situation in various architectural jobs, just looking at the situation in some schools is enough to worry people!

Shanghai Tongji University wanted to build a central teaching building and conducted comparative designs internally, putting forward twenty-two proposals. Relevant construction departments in Shanghai and professors from Nanjing Institute of Technology were invited to participate in the evaluation meeting. This can't be said to be not cautious, right? However, the adopted design drawing still had serious errors and took the road of restoring ancient styles due to the formalism ideology. Construction according to this design drawing wasted a large amount of state funds. Recently, some of the designs that had not yet started construction were modified, the large roof was cancelled, and false decorations were removed. Although less money was spent, what impact will this design thinking have on the young people studying architecture at this school!

The three new buildings of Yunnan University were designed by a professor from the original civil engineering department of the school. In his design, he was only obsessed with the image of "European Renaissance architecture," using "the five famous architectural column styles of ancient Europe," and even believed that some decorations were "things that Europe has proved successful after more than two thousand years of testing and must not be changed." According to his opinion, the architectural achievements of the 1960s are of no use to us!

There are similar situations in the Department of Architecture of Tsinghua University in Beijing: Under the guidance of some teachers, when students mention architecture, they think of small bridges, flowing water, evening glow, and sunset; when talking about learning, they only seek to be able to draw, so they study how to draw trees, cars, people, and the sky, as capital for design; when considering design, they first look for outlines, and a kind of mysterious thing like "one more bend is too soft, a little harder is too stiff"; when recalling the history of our country's architecture, it is "Qing is not as good as Ming, Ming is not as good as Liao, Liao is not as good as Tang," the more ancient the better. In short, they rarely think about the needs of real life, and rarely talk about economic principles. Why is this? Because the professors teach this way, and they use these to judge the merits of student grades.

This is really unfortunate: pure young people are bound by formalistic architectural ideas in school. After leaving school, they see many formalistic buildings. As a result, they blindly take this as a direction. As a result, many young people despise industrial building design and standard design, and they want to design large buildings as soon as they start designing, which makes serious mistakes. Can they be blamed for this! But, at the same time, fortunately: The Party and the government promptly proposed and criticized the errors in architectural thinking.

At present, the task of higher and secondary schools offering architecture courses should be to criticize the wrong teaching ideas in the past architecture and educate students with correct architectural ideas. Then someone shouted: "There are difficulties! It is troublesome to revise textbooks, add necessary teaching content, and correct teaching plans!" What can be done about this? In order to be responsible for China's architecture and for the young people studying architecture, these difficulties must be overcome. The administrative leaders, party organizations, and professors of relevant schools should take active action to overcome difficulties and clear the formalistic architectural ideas out of our schools.

### 为未来的建筑师着想

    为未来的建筑师着想
    牟澜
    青年是“祖国青春的花朵”。不过，这“花朵”是需要培植的：不但要教给他们文化、科学知识；更应经常用社会主义和共产主义的思想教育他们，使他们健康地生长。
    可是，当我想到这两年我国建筑界的情况的时候，不能不替某些青年——未来的建筑师们捏一把汗：教给他们的是什么呢？留给他们的是什么榜样呢？且不说在实际工作中、在各个建筑工作岗位上如何，只看一看某些学校中的情形，也就够人担心了！
    上海同济大学要盖中心教学大楼，在内部进行了比较设计，提出过二十二种方案，请了上海有关建设部门和南京工学院的教授参加了评图会。这总不能说不慎重了吧。可是，被采用的设计图仍有严重错误，由于形式主义思想作祟，走了复古的道路。根据这个设计图施工，浪费了国家大量的资金。最近修改了一部分尚未动工的设计，取消了大屋顶、剔除了虚假装饰，虽然少花了一些钱，但是这种设计思想会给在这个学校学建筑的青年什么影响呢！
    云南大学新建的三幢大楼，是由该校原土木系的一位教授设计的。他在设计中只醉心于“欧洲文艺复兴时代建筑”的形象，搬用“欧洲古代著名的五种建筑柱式典范”，而且把某些装饰认为是“欧洲经过两千多年考验证明成功的东西，是决不能更改的”。依照他的意见，二十世纪六十年代的建筑成就对我们是没有什么用处的！
    北京清华大学建筑系也有类似的情况：在有些教师的指导下，学生一提到建筑，就想到小桥流水、晚霞落日；谈到学习，只求会画就行，于是去研究如何画树、画汽车、画人、画天，以作为设计的资本；考虑设计时，首先找轮廓线，而且是一种“再弯一分太软，再硬一点太僵”等奥妙的东西；回忆祖国建筑历史时，便是“清不如明、明不如辽、辽不如唐”，愈古愈好。总之，很少想到现实生活的需要，也很少谈经济原则。为什么会这样呢？因为教授这样教，而且就是用这些来判断学生成绩优劣的。
    这真是不幸：纯洁的青年在学校中就被形式主义的建筑思想束缚了。走出学校后又看到很多形式主义建筑。于是也就盲目的以此作方向。结果，不少的青年轻视工业建筑设计和标准设计，一动手设计就想设计大建筑，便犯了严重的错误。这难道能怪他们吗！但，同时也万幸：党和政府及时提出和批判了建筑思想上的错误。
    当前，设有建筑课程的高等、中等学校的任务，应该是批判过去建筑上的错误的教学思想，用正确的建筑思想教育学生。于是有人就叫唤：“有困难哪！要修改教材、增加必要的教学内容、订正教学计划等，很费事啊！”这有什么办法呢？为了对中国的建筑、对学建筑的青年负责，必须克服这些困难。有关学校的行政领导干部、党的组织、教授，都应积极行动起来，克服困难，把形式主义的建筑思想从我们学校里清扫出去。
