    Cashmere
    Gao Shao Cheng

    Cashmere is the down fiber from goats, and it comes in three colors: the cashmere collected from black goats is called purple cashmere, from gray-blue goats is called blue cashmere, and from white goats is called white cashmere. Blue and white cashmere can be dyed into various shades of color, so their use value is higher than that of purple cashmere.

    In our country, cashmere is produced in the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Rehe, Liaoning, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Among them, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has the largest output, accounting for more than 50% of the country's total output.

    The time for collecting cashmere is generally after the Qingming Festival, except in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region where it is later, when the cashmere has grown sufficiently but has not yet fallen off. The method of collecting cashmere is to use an iron comb made of hard iron wire, combing from the head of the goat backwards, like combing hair. However, the cashmere collection must be done in the appropriate season, otherwise collecting it too early will freeze the sheep, and collecting it too late will result in poor quality.

    The quality of cashmere in our country is excellent, and the fibers are fine and uniform, making it a raw material for high-grade woolen fabrics. The yarn and woolen materials woven from it are soft, smooth, and durable. Garments, scarves, and various clothing made from it are very beautiful.

    Cashmere is one of the export commodities, and it has long been famous in the international market and has a wide sales network. Since liberation, the export trade of cashmere has developed even more. Now, it is not only sold to fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union, the Czechoslovak Republic, and the German Democratic Republic, but also to the markets of capitalist countries such as Britain, Japan, and West Germany. Exporting cashmere can accumulate funds to promote national industrialization. For example, exporting 2,000 jin of cashmere can be exchanged for more than 76,000 jin of steel or more than 150,000 jin of gasoline. From 1950 to 1954, the cashmere purchased by state-owned livestock companies could be exchanged for two complete sets of equipment as large as the seamless steel pipe plant in Anshan Iron and Steel, and a thermal power plant with a capacity of 25,000 kilowatts, which could supply electricity for cities with a population of 800,000 to 1.2 million.

    Therefore, we should find ways to increase the production of cashmere. Before liberation, due to the cruel oppression and plunder of farmers and herdsmen by imperialists and domestic reactionary rulers, the number of goats raised by farmers and herdsmen decreased day by day. In addition, the lack of guidance on cashmere collection techniques resulted in a large amount of cashmere falling off and being abandoned in the wild. After liberation, the Party and the government stipulated the policy of protecting and developing animal husbandry. State-owned trading companies and supply and marketing cooperatives purchased large quantities at reasonable prices and focused on promoting cashmere collection techniques. The production of cashmere is constantly increasing. In 1954, the national cashmere production exceeded the highest annual output in history, more than doubling the output in the early days of liberation. However, because cashmere collection techniques have not been universally promoted, many farmers and herdsmen in some areas still do not know how to collect cashmere. Some areas have not completely switched to using iron combs to collect cashmere and still maintain the habit of using scissors to cut and hand-pull, which affects the production and quality of cashmere and also affects the income of farmers and herdsmen. At the same time, the current cashmere production is only 60% of the potential production quantity, and there are still 40% of potential sources of goods. If these potential sources are tapped, we can exchange for steel rails to build a railway more than 700 li long in a year. Therefore, farmers and herdsmen should be educated to pay attention to raising goats and developing the sideline production of cashmere collection, and cashmere collection techniques should be vigorously promoted so that farmers and herdsmen are good at grasping the cashmere collection season, learn cashmere collection methods, and increase cashmere production.

    山羊绒
    高少澄
    山羊绒是山羊身上的绒毛，它的颜色有三种：从黑山羊身上抓下来的叫紫绒，从青灰山羊身上抓下来的叫青绒，从白山羊身上抓下来的叫白绒。青绒和白绒可以染成各种深浅不同的颜色，所以使用价值比紫绒高。
    我国的山羊绒产于陕西、甘肃、青海、新疆、河北、河南、山东、山西、热河、辽宁等省和内蒙古自治区，其中以内蒙古自治区的产量最大，约占全国总产量的百分之五十以上。
    每年抓绒的时间，除内蒙古自治区较晚外，其他地区大约都在清明以后，即山羊绒已经长足但还没有脱落的时候。抓绒的方法是用一种硬铁丝做成的铁抓子，从山羊的头往后梳，像梳头发一样，但是抓绒必须掌握适宜的季节，否则抓早了会把羊冻坏，抓晚了质量就不好。
    我国山羊绒的品质优良，纤维匀细，是上等毛织品的原料，用它纺织成的绒线和呢绒料子，品质柔软光滑又耐用；做成大衣、围巾和各种服装很美观。
    山羊绒是出口物资之一，在国际市场上早就有名，销路很广。解放后，山羊绒的出口贸易更加发展了。现在，不仅销售给苏联、捷克斯洛伐克共和国和德意志民主共和国等兄弟国家，同时也在英国、日本和西德等资本主义国家的市场上销售。出口山羊绒可以积累资金促进国家工业化。如出口两千斤山羊绒，就能换回七万六千多斤钢材或十五万斤多汽油。国营畜产公司从一九五○年到一九五四年所收购的山羊绒，可向国外换回两套像鞍钢无缝钢管厂那样规模的全套设备，和一个容量两万五千瓩，供八十万到一百二十万人口城市用电的火力发电厂的设备。
    因此，我们就应该想办法增加山羊绒的产量。在解放前，由于帝国主义和国内反动统治者对农民牧民的残酷压迫和掠夺，农民牧民饲养的山羊日益减少，再加上缺乏对抓绒技术的指导，致使大量山羊绒脱落而遗弃山野。解放后，党和政府规定了保护和发展畜牧业的方针，国营贸易公司和供销合作社以合理价格大量收购，并重点推广了抓绒技术，山羊绒的产量正在不断增加。一九五四年全国山羊绒产量已超过历史上最高年产量，比解放初期的产量增加了一倍以上。但因抓绒技术没有普遍推广，不少地区的农民牧民仍然不会抓绒，有些地区还没有完全改用铁抓子抓绒，仍旧保持着用剪子剪和用手拔的习惯，影响了山羊绒的产量和质量，也影响了农民牧民的收入。同时，目前山羊绒的产量只及可产数量的百分之六十，还有百分之四十的潜在货源，如果把这些潜在货源发掘出来，一年就可向国外换回能铺七百多华里长的铁路的钢轨。因此，应该教育农民牧民注意饲养山羊，发展抓取山羊绒的副业生产，并应大力推广抓绒技术，使农民牧民们善于掌握抓绒季节，学会抓绒方法，提高羊绒产量。
