    Why This Forest Railway Was Badly Built
    Mei Fengxiang
    In 1953, the Sancha'zi Forest Industry Bureau discovered twelve new logging areas. The original flatcar lines were slow to turn around, had low timber transport efficiency, and were unsuitable for long-distance transportation, failing to meet the needs of timber transportation. The Sancha'zi Forest Industry Bureau then requested the original Northeast Forest Industry Administration to convert the flatcar lines into a forest railway. At that time, it was calculated that the freight cost per cubic meter of timber transported by forest railway could be reduced by twelve yuan compared to flatcar lines.
    The original Northeast Forest Industry Administration approved this request, but without considering the possibility of subjective strength and objective conditions, it hastily decided to complete and put it into production on March 1, 1954, without starting from reality. At the same time, the director of the Forest Railway Division of the Forest Industry Administration wrote to the Sancha'zi Forest Industry Bureau, asking them to build the railway according to the principle of "making do with whatever is available." He said: "Forest railways are not like ordinary railways. If you can't go fast, you can go slowly. If you fall off the track, you can put it back on."
    To have this forest railway completed by March 1, it was necessary to organize winter construction. In December 1953, the Capital Construction Section of the Sancha'zi Forest Industry Bureau, after understanding the overall situation, believed that under the specific circumstances at that time, organizing winter construction would result in an overspending of one million yuan. The Sancha'zi Forest Industry Bureau's bureau affairs meeting decided to "advance steadily and open to traffic on July 1," and reported it to the Northeast Forest Industry Administration for approval. After receiving the report, the Northeast Forest Industry Administration instructed the Sancha'zi Forest Industry Bureau in January 1954: "We believe that it is possible to strive for opening to traffic at the end of March. It is not necessary to have 100% of the conditions to open to traffic. If the line is not good, it can be repaired." Then, the Northeast Forest Industry Administration criticized the Capital Construction Section of the Sancha'zi Forest Industry Bureau for being conservative. By March 9, seeing that opening to traffic was hopeless, the Northeast Forest Industry Administration agreed to postpone the completion date, but at the same time instructed: "We must strive to open to traffic on 'May 1'. If we encounter ideological resistance, we must criticize it at any time."
    Under these circumstances, the Sancha'zi Forest Industry Bureau acted blindly, without considering the objective laws of capital construction. They surveyed and constructed at the same time; they constructed first, then made plans, and then reported the plan task book. However, the planning department could not come up with a plan, the engineering department felt unable to start, the finance department did not know how much money was needed, and the materials department could not come up with a supply plan. As a result, waste phenomena such as idling and rework occurred during construction.
    In late April, seeing that the task could not be completed by "May 1," the Sancha'zi Forest Industry Bureau did not hesitate to violate national labor laws, working overtime to rush the repairs. Some workers worked 14 hours a day, and ordinary workers, in addition to the one hour increase approved by the county people's government labor department, also added four hours. Especially in the three days from April 28 to 30, some workers worked all night, exhausted.
    "May 1" came, and it was clear that it could not be opened to traffic, but in order to complete the task of opening to traffic on "May 1," the Sancha'zi Forest Industry Bureau solemnly held an opening ceremony, held a conference, and cut the ribbon. After the train departed, because a section of the line in the middle had not been completed, it had to take the old flatcar road.
    Blind construction brought about the bad result of poor engineering quality. The large earth-filling project in one construction site was not constructed according to standards, and the width was insufficient. In the second construction site, the earth for seven kilometers of line had not yet been filled before sleepers and rails were laid. After the traffic opened, it was lifted and refilled. Due to poor line quality and other reasons, accidents occurred frequently after the traffic opened. From July 16 to the end of November 1954, a total of 416 accidents occurred, resulting in the loss of more than 1,000 work hours, affecting the completion of more than 56,000 cubic meters of timber transport tasks.
    Due to the lack of careful surveying and design and serious violations of capital construction procedures, the investment plan was changed five times, from 600,000 yuan to 800,000 yuan, 1.04 million yuan, 1.39 million yuan, and finally considered to require more than 2.5 million yuan.
    The reconstruction project of the forest railway of the Sancha'zi Forest Industry Bureau violated the normal order of capital construction. This rash and impetuous result did not reduce timber transportation costs, but increased procedures, making timber transportation disjointed. A section of the entire 80-kilometer line was a flatcar line, a section was a forest railway, and a section was transported by trolley. When going downhill, it relied on people to release it, and when going uphill, it was pulled by horses. This pursuit of "speed" resulted in "more haste, less speed."
    For the forest railway of the Sancha'zi Forest Industry Bureau, it is correct to "make do with whatever is available" and fully utilize existing equipment because the operating life of the logging area is not long, but this does not mean that one can disregard capital construction procedures and disregard quality. This lesson is worth learning from.

    这条森林铁路为什么造坏了
    梅凤祥
    一九五三年三岔子森林工业局发现了十二处新伐区，原有的平车线路周转慢，运材效率低，而且不适于远距离运输，无法满足木材运输的需要。三岔子森林工业局就向原东北森林工业管理局请求将平车线路改建为森林铁路。当时计算采用森林铁路运送木材每立方公尺的运费可较平车线路降低十二元。
    原东北森林工业管理局批准了这个请求，但却没有考虑主观力量和客观条件的可能性，不从实际出发，就草率决定在一九五四年三月一日竣工投入生产。同时森林工业管理局森林铁路处处长写信给三岔子森林工业局要他们以“因陋就简”的方针修建这条铁路，他说：“森林铁路不比一般铁路。不能快走可以慢走，掉了道可以再扶上去。”
    要使这条森林铁路在三月一日竣工，就必须组织冬季施工。一九五三年十二月，三岔子森林工业局基本建设科了解了全面情况后，认为在当地当时的具体情况下，如果组织冬季施工，要超支一百万元。三岔子森林工业局局务会议就决定“稳步前进，七月一日通车”，并报请东北森林工业管理局批准。东北森林工业管理局接到报告后，于一九五四年一月指示三岔子森林工业局说：“我们认为争取三月末开运是可能的，并不需要具有百分之百的条件才能开运，线路不好可以修整”。接着，东北森林工业管理局又批评三岔子森林工业局基本建设科有保守思想。到了三月九日眼看开运无望，东北森林工业管理局才同意推迟竣工日期，但同时又指示：“一定争取‘五一’通车，如果遇到思想抵触，必须随时加以批判。”
    在这种情况下，三岔子森林工业局也就毫不考虑基本建设的客观规律，盲目行动起来。他们一边测量，一边施工；先施工、后做计划，再报计划任务书。然而计划部门提不出计划，工程部门感到无法下手，财务部门不知要多少钱，材料部门提不出供应计划，于是，在施工中造成窝工返工等浪费现象。
    到四月下旬，看着到“五一”还是不能完成任务，三岔子森林工业局不惜破坏国家劳动法令，加班加点突击抢修，部分工人每天劳动十四小时，一般工人除县人民政府劳动部门批准每天增加一小时外，也多加了四小时，尤其在四月二十八日到三十日的三天中，有的工人竟通宵干活，疲劳不堪。
    “五一”节来了，分明不能通车，但三岔子森林工业局为了完成“五一”通车的任务，竟郑重其事地举行了通车典礼，开了大会，剪了彩。列车开出后，由于中间还有一段线路没有完工，只得走旧平车道。
    盲目施工带来了工程质量低劣的恶果，一工地大填土工程不按标准施工，宽度不够，二工地有七公里线路土还没有填好，就铺枕木钉钢轨，通车后又掀起重填。由于线路质量低劣等原因，通车后事故频繁，从一九五四年七月十六日至十一月末共发生事故四百一十六次，损失一千多个工时，影响五万六千多立方公尺运材任务的完成。
    由于缺乏周密勘察设计，严重违反基本建设的程序，投资计划变更了五次，从六十万元，改为八十万元，一百零四万元，一百三十九万元，最后考虑需二百五十余万元。
    三岔子森林工业局森林铁路的改建工程违反了基本建设的正常秩序。这种急躁冒进的结果，并没有减低木材运输成本，反而增加了工序，使木材运输互不衔接。整个八十多公里的线路有一段是平车线路，有一段是森林铁路，有一段是用台车运送，下坡时靠人放，上坡时用马拉。这种求“快”，结果是“欲速则不达”。
    三岔子森林工业局这条森林铁路，因伐区作业年限不长，“因陋就简”，充分利用现有设备是正确的，但这决不等于就可以不按基本建设的程序办事和不顾质量。这个教训是值得引以为戒的。
