    Waste in the Construction of Sanatoriums in the Qingdao Area
    Yu Xiuqi, Tian Xingyuan
    Qingdao is located near the coast with beautiful scenery. In recent years, the state and trade union organizations, in order to protect the health of workers and reduce the occurrence and development of diseases, have built, renovated, and expanded many sanatoriums and rest homes here. However, due to many unreasonable phenomena in the construction of these sanatoriums and rest homes, they not only fail to meet actual needs but also waste a lot of funds.
    First of all, there is a tendency of blind development in construction. For example, the Qingdao Textile Workers' Rest Home originally planned to build fourteen rest home buildings with one hundred and fifty beds each, occupying half a mountain's land. In 1952, after only two buildings and a side gate were built, it was decided not to develop further. Now, the originally occupied land has to be given to other units. Because the planned main gate could not be built, the side gate had to be used as the main gate. The Second Machinery Trade Union originally planned to build a sanatorium with a capacity of three hundred beds, purchasing a large piece of land. In 1954, it built a building with a capacity of one hundred and fifty beds and built a complete set of auxiliary buildings according to the needs of three hundred beds, including a boiler room, auditorium, dining hall, office, laundry room, staff dormitory, and bathhouse. However, after the completion of these auxiliary buildings, the construction plan for three hundred beds was reduced to one hundred and fifty. In this way, the entire set of auxiliary buildings is equivalent to wasting half of the building area and cost. The Qingdao Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Sanatorium was built according to a plan with a capacity of three hundred beds, but because the rooms were not reasonably constructed, it could only accommodate two hundred beds. Moreover, since its completion in 1954, the two hundred beds have often been vacant, sometimes used to entertain cultural troupes, and sometimes used to hold trade union member representative conferences. From the above examples, it can be seen that the plans of various units to build sanatoriums and rest homes, due to not starting from actual needs and blindly developing, have accumulated and wasted a large amount of funds. Therefore, we suggest that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions should uniformly review the construction plans of various units and scientifically stipulate and control the ratio and quota for each unit to make plans.
    Secondly, the construction of sanatoriums is too decentralized, failing to fully utilize their effectiveness. There are currently eight sanatoriums in Qingdao, each with its own set of auxiliary buildings such as a club, auditorium, boiler room, laundry room, and office building. Because each unit only admits its own workers for recuperation, many sanatorium buildings are not fully occupied. In winter, most of them are vacant, and of course, other auxiliary buildings are even less likely to be fully utilized. In addition, although the sanatorium buildings of the established units are not fully occupied, the units that have not built them are eager to build their own, which shows that on the one hand, the effectiveness of the completed buildings has not been fully utilized, and on the other hand, money is being spent on new construction, which together is a greater waste. If the plans are submitted by various units, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions uniformly manages, constructs, and distributes them, it will not only fully utilize the effectiveness of the sanatoriums and increase the number of year-round recuperators but also avoid the phenomenon of each unit doing its own thing and decentralization being unreasonable. For example, this year, about six cadres from the Light Industry Trade Union and about five cadres from the First Machinery Trade Union were transferred from Beijing to Qingdao to be responsible for construction matters, as well as cadres from the Construction Trade Union and other units. These units are all under the unified leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. If they were built uniformly, a lot of management cadres and office expenses could be saved. The plans of various units all propose to purchase a truck, a transportation vehicle, and a car. If they were managed uniformly, a lot of car purchase costs could be saved, and the efficiency of car use could be maximized.
    Third, the construction standards are not unified, the requirements are inconsistent, and each unit does its own thing, which also causes great waste. The number of people that can be accommodated in the sanatorium rooms built by various units is one, two, three, and even four. Some are calculated according to ten square meters per person, while others are calculated according to six and a half square meters or seven square meters per person. Originally, the sanatoriums built in Qingdao are intended for general occupational disease patients, the equipment and management are the same, and they were built in the same year of the first five-year plan. It is possible to unify standards under reasonably appropriate conditions. Imagine that if it is reasonable for four people to live in a room, then it is a great waste in terms of structural area and project cost for three people to live in a room. If it is reasonable to calculate the use of six and a half square meters per person, then it is also a great waste in terms of building area to calculate according to seven square meters and ten square meters.
    In addition, some units are currently putting forward requirements for pursuing formality and being excessively high and large. The First Machinery Trade Union once proposed that the sanatorium should have flying eaves and large roofs. Some units have proposed relatively expensive physiotherapy equipment for basic construction costs or equipment costs, such as some wanting to set up X-ray rooms, some wanting to set up hydrotherapy rooms, and some wanting to set up physical therapy rooms. For example, the newly built sanatorium of the Construction Trade Union has an X-ray room in the newly built physiotherapy clinic of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which is less than 200 meters away from the hospital, but it still wants to build its own X-ray room with a large investment. Why can't they be used uniformly?
    This phenomenon of blindly, decentralizing, and extravagantly building sanatoriums should not continue. It is hoped that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions can promptly inspect, uniformly manage, and uniformly plan, so as to uniformly design and construct according to standards. On the other hand, it is hoped that under possible conditions, unified management and unified use can be implemented, so as to fully utilize the existing sanatoriums, avoid wasting investment, and reduce the number of sanatoriums that can be built or not.

    青岛地区疗养院建设中的浪费
    余秀起　田兴元
    青岛靠近海滨，风景优美，几年来，国家和工会组织为保护职工身体健康，减少疾病的发生和发展，曾在这里新建、改建和扩建了不少疗养院和休养院，但是，由于这些疗养院和休养院在建设中存在着很多不合理现象，不仅不能满足实际需要，并且浪费了很多资金。
    首先是建设中存在着盲目发展的偏向。如青岛纺织工人休养院原计划要兴建一百五十个床位的休养楼十四栋，占用了半个山的土地。一九五二年只修建了两栋和做了一个侧门后，又决定不发展了。现在只得将原占用地让给其他单位，因原计划的大门不能建设，只得用侧门做正门。第二机械工会原计划修建一座可容三百个床位的疗养院，购置了很大一片土地，在一九五四年兴建了可容一百五十个床位的建筑物，并按三百个床位的需要兴建了锅炉房、礼堂、食堂、办公室、洗衣房、职工宿舍、洗澡房等全套附属建筑物。但这些附属建筑工程完工后，却将三百个床位的修建计划削减为一百五十个。这样全套附属建筑就等于浪费了一半的建筑面积和造价。青岛市总工会疗养院按可容三百个床位的计划建成的疗养楼，因房间建筑不合理，结果只能放下二百个床位。而且自一九五四年建成后，二百个床位还经常空闲着，有时为招待文工团使用；也有时为召开工会会员代表大会使用。从以上的例子可以看出：各单位修建疗养院和休养院的计划，由于不从实际需要出发，盲目发展，就积压和浪费了大批资金。因此我们建议全国总工会统一审查各单位的修建计划，科学地规定和控制各单位做计划的比率和定额。
    其次，疗养院建设太分散，没有充分发挥使用效能。青岛的疗养院现有八个，各有各的俱乐部、礼堂、锅炉房、洗衣房、办公楼等一套附属建筑。因为各单位收容疗养员都仅限于本单位的职工，所以许多疗养楼都住不满人数。在冬季里更大部分空闲起来，当然其它附属建筑就更不可能充分利用了。另外，虽然已建单位的疗养楼住不满，而未建单位却又急于自搞一套，这说明一方面已建成的使用效能没有充分发挥，一方面又在花钱去新建，合在一起就是一笔更大的浪费。如果由各单位提出计划，在全国总工会统一掌握下兴建和统一管理、统一分配，不但可以充分发挥疗养院的使用效能，增加常年疗养人数，而且可以避免各搞一套和分散不合理现象。如今年自北京调到青岛负责办理建设事宜的轻工业工会干部约六人，第一机械工会约五人，还有建筑工会等单位的干部。这些单位都是由全国总工会统一领导的，如果统一兴建就能节省很多管理干部和办公费。各单位计划中都提出要购置一辆卡车、一辆交通车、一辆小轿车，如果统一管理，就可省去许多汽车购置费，并能尽量发挥汽车使用效率。
    第三、修建标准不统一，要求条件不一致，各搞一套，也造成很大浪费。各单位修建的疗养院疗养房间可容人数有一人、二人、三人，还有四人的，有的按每人十平方公尺计算，有的按每人六点五平方公尺或七平方公尺计算。本来青岛所修建的疗养院收容对象都是一般职业病患者，设备和管理性质都一样，而且是同在第一个五年计划的同一年度中修建，在相当合理的条件下统一标准是可能的。试想如果以四个人住一间为合理的话，那么三个人住一间在结构面积和工程造价上就浪费很大；如果以每人按六点五平方公尺计算使用为合理的话，那末按七平方公尺和十平方公尺计算在建筑面积上浪费也是很大的。
    另外，目前还有些单位提出追求形式和偏高偏大的要求，第一机械工会就曾提出疗养院要有飞檐、大屋顶的要求。有的单位提出基本建设费或设备费较贵的理疗设备，如有的要设X光室，有的要设水疗室，有的要设体疗室。如建筑工会新建的疗养院，在距离该院不到二百公尺的全国总工会新建的理疗门诊部就设有X光室，但还要自建投资很大的X光室。为什么不能统一使用呢？
    这种盲目地、分散地和铺张浪费地建设疗养院的现象不应该继续下去了，希望全国总工会能够及时检查，统一掌握，统一计划，以便统一地按标准进行设计和施工。另一方面，希望在可能条件下，统一管理和统一使用，以便对现有的疗养院充分利用，避免浪费投资，并可缩减一部分可建可不建的疗养院。
