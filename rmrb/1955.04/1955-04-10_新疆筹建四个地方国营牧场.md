    Xinjiang Province is actively preparing to establish four local state-run ranches. Preliminary surveys and planning have been carried out for two ranches located in Hutubi County and Fukang County; preparations for the establishment of two ranches in Hami and Aksu regions are also underway.

    The two ranches located in Hutubi County and Fukang County plan to raise nearly 10,000 sheep and more than 600 bulls and dairy cows in 1955 to supply the large quantities of meat and milk needed by the people of all ethnic groups in Urumqi. The staff establishing the ranch in Hutubi County are developing a 1,500 mu fodder base.
