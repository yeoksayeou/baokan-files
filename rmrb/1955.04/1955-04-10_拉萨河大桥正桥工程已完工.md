    Lhasa River Bridge Main Bridge Project Completed
    The main bridge project of the Lhasa River Bridge was fully completed on the 5th. Early in the morning of the 6th, loaded trucks and groups of mules and horses continuously passed over the bridge.
    The Lhasa River Bridge is the longest bridge on the entire Kangzang Highway, solidly and beautifully constructed, with pedestrian walkways and guardrails on both sides of the roadway.
    In the construction of the bridge, the motherland provided more than 120 tons of steel materials, and more than 450 truckloads of timber were transported from more than 300 kilometers away. The bridge construction workers built the water-crossing section of the bridge in eighteen days in the severe cold weather of December 1954. From mid-February of this year, the workers launched a labor emulation drive. Pile drivers, bulldozers and other machinery were also put into construction. More than 100 lumberjacks preparing materials in the forests of the Gongbu area supplied timber in a timely manner, and the workers of the Tibet Military Region Iron and Wood Factory also rushed to produce many steel parts for the bridge.
    The Lhasa River Bridge is the first bridge over the Lhasa River. After the bridge is completed, it will connect the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways, and will also facilitate the exchanges between the people of the Lhasa Plain and the farmers of the Shannan area, and the herdsmen of the Northern Tibet area.

    拉萨河大桥正桥工程已完工
    拉萨河大桥正桥工程在五日全部完工。六日清晨，载重汽车和成群的骡马不断从大桥上通过。
    拉萨河大桥是康藏公路全线最长的桥梁，修建得牢固美观，在行车道两侧设有人行便道和护栏。
    建筑大桥中，祖国内地供应了一百二十多吨钢料，从三百多公里外运来四百五十多辆卡车木材。修桥工人在一九五四年十二月的严寒天气中，用十八天的时间建成了大桥的跨水部分。从今年二月中旬起，工人们开展了劳动竞赛。打桩机、推土机等机械也投入了施工。在工布地区森林里备料的一百多名伐木工人，及时供应了木料，西藏军区铁木工厂工人们也为大桥赶制了许多钢铁零件。
    拉萨河大桥是拉萨河上的第一座桥梁，大桥建成后，把康藏、青藏公路连接在一起，同时便利了拉萨平原人民和山南区农民、藏北区牧民间的来往。　（新华社）
