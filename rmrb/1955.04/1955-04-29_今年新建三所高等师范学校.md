Three New Higher Normal Schools to be Built This Year

    In accordance with the guidelines stipulated in the "Instructions on Improving and Developing Higher Normal Education" of the former Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, the Ministry of Education recently approved the establishment of normal colleges or normal vocational schools in Beijing, western Shandong (address not yet finalized), and Changsha by the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau, Shandong Province, and Hunan Provincial Department of Education in the summer of 1955, respectively, to meet the needs of secondary school teachers in various regions. The Ministry of Education has also made specific provisions for the names of the new schools in various regions, the establishment of departments and specialties, and enrollment tasks. The school to be established in Beijing is named Beijing Normal College, and this year it will temporarily set up four departments: Chinese Language and Literature, History, Mathematics, and Physics, and seven specialized courses: Chinese Language and Literature, History, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Geography, enrolling 600 students.
