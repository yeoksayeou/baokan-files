Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 21st. Indian newspapers welcomed Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the Asian-African Conference on the 19th.

    The "Hindustan Times" published an editorial on the 21st, saying, "Zhou Enlai's contribution may be the most constructive. He made it clear that he is faithful to the Five Principles and unwilling to get involved in verbal battles. He assured the delegates that his delegation was 'here to seek common ground, not to create differences.' He suggested establishing diplomatic relations with all Asian and African countries and invited everyone to visit China to see the situation for themselves."

    The "Indian Express" welcomed the "constructive attitude" of Premier Zhou Enlai's speech in an editorial on the 21st. The editorial said that the spirit of Premier Zhou Enlai's invitation to all participating countries to visit China and see the situation there for themselves would surely be admired by all. "His emphasis that China has not established military bases outside its borders, as some other countries have done, should prove that China is only concerned with strengthening itself. His willingness to discuss the issue of overseas Chinese with the governments concerned should also be satisfactory."

    The editorial said, "In short, Zhou Enlai's attitude should be welcomed because it is moderate and reasonable. No one can expect him to remain silent on the Taiwan issue as long as it affects China's rights; if he also mentioned the difficulties in implementing the Geneva Accords on Indochina, he is not alone in feeling that someone has engaged in unnecessary provocation. He is completely justified when he begins to talk about the injustice of racial discrimination and colonial mentality in countries outside of certain conferences."

    The Urdu "Glory" newspaper published an editorial on the 21st, saying that Premier Zhou Enlai "appropriately avoided raising controversial issues at the Bandung Conference."

    印度报纸欢迎周总理在亚非会议上的发言
    新华社新德里二十一日电　印度报纸欢迎周恩来总理十九日在亚非会议上的发言。
    “印度斯坦时报”二十一日发表社论说，“周恩来的贡献可能是最有建设性的。他明确表示他忠实于五项原则，并且不愿卷入舌战中去。他向代表们保证，他的代表团是‘来求同而不是来立异的。’他建议同一切亚非国家建立外交关系，并且邀请大家去访问中国，以亲自了解情况。”
    “印度快报”在二十一日的社论中欢迎周恩来总理发言的“建设性态度”。社论说，周恩来总理邀请所有到会的各国代表到中国去参观以亲自了解那里的情况的精神，一定会得到全体的钦佩。“他强调说明中国并没有像其他一些国家所做的那样，在它的国境以外建立军事基地，这一点应当能够证明中国只是关心于加强它自己的。他表示愿意同有关国家政府讨论华侨问题，这一点也应当是令人满意的。”
    社论说，“总之，周恩来的态度应该受到欢迎，因为它是温和的、合理的。只要台湾问题影响中国的权利一天，没有人可以期望他对台湾问题保持缄默；如果他也提到在履行关于印度支那的日内瓦协定方面存在着困难，那么不只他一个人感到有人进行了不必要的挑衅。当他着手谈到某些会议以外的国家中存在着肤色歧视和殖民心理的不公正情形时，他是完全有根据的。”
    乌尔都文“光荣报”二十一日发表社论说，周恩来总理“避免在万隆会议提出引起争论的问题，那是很恰当的”。
