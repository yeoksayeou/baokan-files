    Celebrating the Tenth Anniversary of Hungary's Liberation
    April 4th marks the tenth anniversary of Hungary's liberation.
    Ten years ago, on April 4, 1945, the glorious Soviet army liberated Hungary from the oppression of German fascism, granting the Hungarian people freedom and paving the way for them to embark on the path of peaceful democracy and socialism.
    Before liberation, the Hungarian people were subjected to the oppression of German imperialism from the outside and the exploitation of large landowners and capitalists from within. The Second World War brought immense disaster to the Hungarian people, with 600,000 lives lost and 355,000 houses destroyed by the war...
    After liberation, under the leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party, the Hungarian people rebuilt their new lives from the ruins. The Hungarian workers, peasants, and intellectuals, who had no rights in the past, are now contributing their immense strength and wisdom to socialist construction with their boundless creativity unleashed.

    The Liberty Statue erected on Gellért Hill in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, to commemorate the Soviet army's liberation of Hungary.
    Electric locomotives manufactured in Hungary, which have earned high praise in the international market. This is the Berlin-Prague train.
    One of the largest enterprises built during the Five-Year Plan – the Szeged Textile United Factory, produces a large number of textiles to meet the needs of the people's lives.
    Under the people's democratic system, Hungary's national economy has achieved tremendous development. When the Three-Year Plan was completed in 1949, industrial production reached 137.5 percent of the 1938 level, and when the first Five-Year Plan was completed, it had reached more than three times the 1938 level. This is the magnificent exterior of the Stalin Iron and Steel Plant.
    After the land reform in 1945, with the help of the people's democratic government, farmers began the first step of agricultural mechanization. This is a scene of members of the Petőfi Agricultural Production Cooperative using harvesters to harvest grain.
    Hungary has many state-owned stud farms, which, in addition to raising excellent stallions, also breed many excellent breeds of dairy cows, fat pigs, and poultry. This is a herd of horses on the Hortobágy Steppe.
    Due to the upsurge of the national economy and the development of production capacity, people's lives have become more prosperous. This is a working-class family in St. László Square in Budapest.
    Hungary's oil production is increasing year by year. The output in 1954 increased by 43.9 percent compared to 1953. This is the large-scale Lovászi oil field.
    Hungarian literature and art, which serve the working people and have progressive ideas, have made great progress in recent years. Dramas reflecting new life and historical themes have achieved new successes and are extremely popular with audiences. This is a scene from Gyula Illyés' historical drama "The Example of Ozora," which depicts the Hungarian people's war of independence in 1848-1849.
    Hungary is a country with highly developed sports. The Hungarian football team, which is familiar to the Chinese people, defeated the British football team 7-1 in 1954, achieving a valuable result in 50 years. This is the Hungarian football team in front of the British goal.

    庆祝匈牙利解放十周年
    四月四日是匈牙利解放十周年纪念日。
    十年以前，一九四五年四月四日，光荣的苏联军队把匈牙利从德国法西斯压迫下解放出来。使匈牙利人民获得了自由，并且为匈牙利人民开辟了走向和平民主和社会主义的道路。
    解放以前，匈牙利人民外受德国帝国主义的压迫，内受大地主和资本家的剥削。第二次世界大战又给匈牙利人民带来了巨大的灾难，有六十万人丧失了生命，有三十五万五千幢房屋毁于战火……。
    解放以后，匈牙利人民在匈牙利劳动人民党的领导下，已经从废墟上重新建立起新的生活。过去毫无权利的匈牙利工人、农民和知识分子，现在正以自己解放了的无限的创造力，为社会主义建设贡献着巨大的力量和智慧。　　　  　匈牙利人民共和国驻华大使馆供稿

    在匈牙利首都布达佩斯格列尔山上，为纪念苏军解放匈牙利而矗立的自由神像。
    匈牙利制造的电气机车，在国际市场上取得很高的评价。这是柏林——布拉格的列车。
    五年计划期间兴建的最大企业之一——赛格德纺织联合厂，生产着大批的纺织品供应人民生活的需要。
    匈牙利在人民民主制度下，国民经济获得了巨大的发展。工业生产在一九四九年三年计划完成时，就达到一九三八年水平百分之一百三十七点五，第一个五年计划完成时已经达到一九三八年水平的三倍以上。这是斯大林钢铁厂的雄伟外景。
    一九四五年土地改革以后，农民在人民民主政权的帮助下，开始了晨业机械化的第一步。这是彼得斐农业生产合作社的社员们使用收割机收割谷物的情形。
    匈牙利有着许多国营种马养畜场，除了养育优良种马外，还培育了许多品种优良的乳牛、肥猪和家禽。这是何多巴吉草原上的马群。
    由于国民经济的高涨和生产能力的发展，人民生活更加富裕了。这是布达佩斯圣拉斯洛广场上的一个工人家庭。
    匈牙利的石油产量一年比一年增加。一九五四年的产量就比一九五三年增加了百分之四十三点九。这是规模宏大的劳瓦希油矿。
    为劳动人民服务的、具有进步思想的匈牙利的文学和艺术，在最近几年以来有了很大的发展。在反映新生活和历史题材有了新的成就的戏剧受到观众极大的欢迎。这是久拉·伊尔叶士的描写匈牙利人民一八四八年——一八四九年独立战争的历史剧“峨所拉的榜样”的一个场面。
    匈牙利是体育运动极为发达的国家。为中国人民所熟悉的匈牙利足球队，在一九五四年曾以七比一战胜英国足球队，获得五十年以来很有价值的结果。这是匈牙利足球队在英国球门前面。
