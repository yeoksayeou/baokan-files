The Paris Accords, which prepare for a new war in Europe, have been approved by the parliaments of the major countries concerned. The American aggressive bloc and its followers are eager to implement this agreement, allowing German militarist forces, with American assistance, to begin building a core force of 500,000 troops, equipped with various modern weapons, including atomic weapons. The resurgence of the German militarist army, which has twice launched world wars, is bound to be an extremely serious threat to European security and world peace.

However, the struggle against the Paris Accords is also intensifying in the Western European countries that are party to the Accords. The people of Western Europe clearly recognize that the Paris Accords are detrimental to their vital interests. The implementation of this agreement will drag Western European countries into a path of intensified arms expansion and war preparations, thereby increasing the military expenditure burden on the people of these countries and drastically worsening their lives. At the same time, this agreement will also leave Germany divided for a long time and may cause the people of Western European countries to shed blood for the interests of the American aggressive bloc. The people of European countries, who have suffered the disasters of two German militarist wars of aggression, cannot tolerate this evil scheme of the American aggressive bloc and its followers.

Although the ruling groups of Western European countries succumbed to American pressure and forced the parliamentary approval of the Paris Accords against the will of the people, the struggle of the people of these countries against the Paris Accords has not only not ended, but is continuing to intensify. Labor people and trade union representatives from European countries are scheduled to hold a meeting in Leipzig on April 22 to oppose West German militarization and the Paris Accords, in order to further unite and defend European peace. In a statement issued after the French parliament approved the Paris Accords, the French Communist Party solemnly declared: "The French people will never allow themselves to be drawn into a war against the Soviet Union." At the French National Peace Congress, the two thousand French representatives attending the congress, along with guests from West Germany, Britain, Italy, Belgium, and other countries, unanimously called for a firm halt to the implementation of the plan to arm West Germany and opposition to the threat of atomic war. The movement of the West German people against re-militarization and demanding peaceful reunification is also continuing to develop. In response to the proposal of the government of the German Democratic Republic, in various parts of West Germany where popular votes have already been held, over ninety percent of voters have expressed their opposition to the Paris Accords. The people of other Western European countries are also taking practical actions to prevent the implementation of the Paris Accords. In these countries, many bourgeois figures also stand on the side of their national interests, condemning and opposing the Paris Accords. It is evident that the forces opposing the Paris Accords in these countries are much stronger than the forces supporting it.

Under the strong pressure from the people of Europe and the world, the ruling groups of Western countries have been forced to talk about the issue of holding a great power conference again. Naturally, if this talk about a great power conference is sincere and is for the purpose of easing tensions, people can only welcome it. However, the actual actions of the United States and its British and French partners are very inconsistent with their talk. Therefore, people cannot help but doubt the sincerity of the leaders of the Western three countries, especially the U.S. government, towards the great power conference.

Firstly, judging from the American reaction to Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin's answers to questions from a TASS reporter, the American ruling group is not serious about the issue of a great power conference. Chairman Bulganin stated in his answers to questions that the Soviet Union agreed with the proposal to convene a great power conference and pointed out that the Soviet government had already suggested holding a four-power conference in the near future to resolve the Austrian peace treaty issue. Public opinion in various countries believes that the Soviet government's proposal is a sincere effort to promote a great power conference and ease tensions. The Chinese people and all peace-loving people around the world welcome and support the Soviet government's proposal. However, in the face of the Soviet government's proposal, the U.S. State Department declared, "There is no hope of easing tensions through negotiations with Russia."

Regarding the Austrian peace treaty issue, the United States and its followers have clearly indicated that they do not want a great power conference to resolve it. They are attempting to obstruct the talks between the Soviet government and Austrian Chancellor Raab on the Austrian peace treaty issue. Dulles openly threatened: "The Austrian government cannot negotiate with the Soviet Union for a separate solution or conclude any agreement with Russia without the consent of other occupying countries." Western news agencies also revealed that the U.S., Britain, and France oppose "Austria maintaining neutrality." When the Austrian Chancellor decided to visit the Soviet Union for negotiations, the U.S., Britain, and France issued a declaration, openly putting pressure on the Austrian Chancellor, implying that Austria was not allowed to have the right to refuse to allow foreign countries to establish bases on Austrian territory. This shows that the American aggressive bloc and its followers have always attempted to drag Austria into a military bloc against the Soviet Union and European people's democratic countries, condone the annexation of Austria by Germany, and prepare for a new war. This practice is clearly completely consistent with their accelerated rearmament of West Germany and the obstruction and sabotage of the London disarmament conference, and is incompatible with the purpose of holding a great power conference and easing tensions.

In fact, the United States and its followers are using various tones to make the holding of a great power conference seem very complicated and are trying every means to obstruct it, causing it to be postponed for a long time. What they are really concerned about is quickly completing the procedures for approving the Paris Accords, quickly implementing the revival of German militarism, and dragging West Germany into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. Then hold a North Atlantic Treaty Council meeting to plan the war. Dulles openly said in his speech in the U.S. Senate: The revival of German militarism will "add an important force" to the North Atlantic aggressive bloc to carry out a "forward strategy" in Europe. Obviously, the implementation of the Paris Accords will bring about a fundamental change in the situation in Europe. It will lead to an escalation of the arms race and greatly increase the danger of a new war.

However, if the American aggressive bloc thinks that peace-loving countries and people will underestimate its war conspiracies and the increasing danger of war due to these conspiracies, and thinks that it can learn from Hitler and Japanese militarists to use surprise attacks to catch the forces of peace off guard, then it is completely wrong.

In order to ensure European peace and its own security, the eight governments participating in last year's Moscow Conference have recently conducted further consultations. The eight governments are completely in agreement on the principle of concluding a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance and organizing a joint military command of the contracting states in the event that the Paris Accords are approved. The People's Republic of China agrees with and fully supports the measures formulated by the Soviet Union and the European people's democratic countries. The German Democratic Republic, standing at the forefront of defending peace and opposing the revival of German militarism, has issued a call to take measures to strengthen the forces of the German Democratic Republic. This call has been responded to by workers across the country, especially young workers, who are enthusiastically signing up to join the National Police Force. The great unity and military cooperation and mutual assistance of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp of countries led by the Soviet Union is the main pillar and driving force for defending peace.

The current balance of world power is definitely not in favor of the imperialist war camp. The people of today are no longer people who can be manipulated by war forces. More and more people in the world are soberly taking their destiny into their own hands. They will stand with the peace, democracy, and socialist camp of countries led by the Soviet Union, and resolutely fight against the implementation of the Paris Accords and defend peace. If the war forces headed by the American aggressive bloc are unwilling to be quiet and insist on taking risks, then what awaits them must be a more tragic fate than Hitler and Japanese militarism.

### 坚决反对实施巴黎协定

    坚决反对实施巴黎协定
    在欧洲准备新战争的巴黎协定，已得到有关主要国家议会的批准。美国侵略集团及其追随者迫不及待地要把这个协定付诸实施，使德国军国主义势力在美国的帮助下开始建立一支五十万人的骨干部队，并获得各种现代化武器，包括原子武器在内的装备。曾经两度发动世界大战的德国军国主义军队的再次出现，对欧洲安全和全世界和平都必然是极其严重的威胁。
    但是，反对巴黎协定的斗争同时也在西欧参加巴黎协定的那些国家中更猛烈地开展起来了。西欧各国人民清楚地认识到，巴黎协定是危害他们的切身利益的。这个协定的实施将把西欧国家拖入加紧扩军备战的道路，从而增加各国人民的军费负担，使他们的生活急剧恶化。同时，这个协定并将使德国长期陷于分裂，并有可能使西欧各国人民为美国侵略集团的利益而流血。曾经遭受两次德国军国主义侵略战争灾害的欧洲各国人民，是不能容忍美国侵略集团及其追随者的这种罪恶图谋的。
    尽管西欧各国统治集团屈服于美国的压力，违反人民的意志，强使巴黎协定得到议会的批准，但是，各国人民反对巴黎协定的斗争不但没有终止，反而在继续加强。欧洲国家劳动人民和工会代表定于四月二十二日在来比锡举行反对西德军国主义化和反对巴黎协定的会议，以便进一步团结起来保卫欧洲和平。法国共产党在就法国议会批准巴黎协定发表的声明中庄严地宣告：“法国人民永远不会让自己卷入反对苏联的战争”。在法国全国和平大会中，出席大会的两千名法国代表和西德、英国、意大利、比利时等国的来宾一致号召要坚决阻止武装西德计划的实现，反对原子战争威胁。西德人民反对重新军国主义化、要求和平统一的运动也正在继续发展。响应德意志民主共和国政府的建议，已经举行了人民投票的西德各地，百分之九十以上的投票者表示反对巴黎协定。西欧其他国家的人民群众也在以实际行动来阻止巴黎协定的实施。在这些国家中，许多资产阶级人士也站在自己民族利益的这一方面，谴责和反对巴黎协定。由此可见，这些国家的反对巴黎协定的力量要比支持这个协定的力量强大得多。
    在欧洲和全世界人民的强大压力下，西方国家的统治集团又被迫谈论起举行大国会议的问题来了。自然，这种关于大国会议的谈论如果具有诚意，并且是为了缓和紧张局势的目的，人们对此只能表示欢迎。但是美国及其英、法伙伴的实际行动却和它们的这种谈论十分不符。因此，人们就不能不怀疑到西方三国，特别是美国政府领袖对大国会议的诚意。
    首先从美国对于苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁答塔斯社记者问的反应来看，美国统治集团对待大国会议的问题并不是认真的。布尔加宁主席在答记者问时表示，苏联赞同关于召开大国会议的主张，并指出苏联政府已经建议在不久将来举行一次四国会议，来解决对奥和约问题。各国舆论认为苏联政府的建议是促成大国会议、缓和紧张局势的真诚努力。中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民欢迎并支持苏联政府的建议。但是，面对着苏联政府的建议，美国国务院却扬言，“要想通过同俄国的谈判来缓和紧张局势是没有什么希望的。”
    以对奥和约问题来说，美国和它的追随者们显然表明它们不愿有一个大国会议来解决对奥和约问题。它们企图阻挠苏联政府和奥国总理拉布关于对奥和约问题的会谈。杜勒斯公然威胁说：“奥地利政府不能不经其他占领国家的同意而同苏联谈判以求单独的解决或同俄国订立任何协议”。西方通讯社的消息还透露，美、英、法三国反对使“奥地利守中立”。在奥地利总理决定去苏联访问和进行谈判的时候，美英法三国竟发表宣言，公然对奥国总理施加压力，暗示不许奥国有权拒绝让外国在奥地利领土上建立基地。这就表明，美国侵略集团及其追随者始终企图把奥地利拉入反对苏联和欧洲人民民主国家的军事集团，纵容德奥合并，准备新的战争。这种做法显然和它们加紧重新武装西德、阻挠和破坏伦敦裁军会议的做法是完全一致的，而和举行大国会议、缓和紧张局势的目的不能相容。
    实际上，美国和它的追随者们是在用各种腔调把举行大国会议的事说成非常复杂，并且百般设法阻挠，使它长期推延下去。它们真正关心的是迅速完成批准巴黎协定手续，迅速实行复活德国军国主义，把西德拉进北大西洋侵略集团。然后举行北大西洋公约理事会会议来筹划战争。杜勒斯在美国参议院的发言中就公开说：德国军国主义的复活，将使北大西洋侵略集团“增添一份重要的力量”，来在欧洲执行一种“前进的战略”。显然，巴黎协定的实施将使欧洲的局势发生根本的变化。它将引起军备竞赛的加剧，使新战争的危险大大增加。
    但是，如果美国侵略集团以为爱好和平的国家和人民会对于它的战争阴谋和由于这种阴谋而越来越增加的战争危险估计不足，以为它可以学着希特勒和日本军国主义者的样子用突袭的战争来使和平力量措手不及，那它就大错而特错了。
    为了保障欧洲和平和自身的安全，参加去年莫斯科会议的八国政府最近已经进行了进一步的磋商。八国政府对于在巴黎协定一旦批准的情况下缔结友好合作互助条约的原则及组织缔约国的联合军事司令部的意见，是完全一致的。中华人民共和国同意并完全支持苏联和欧洲人民民主国家所拟定的措施。站在保卫和平和反对复活德国军国主义的最前线的德意志民主共和国已经发出了采取措施以加强德意志民主共和国力量的号召，这个号召得到了全国各地工人，特别是青年工人的响应，他们踊跃报名参加国家警察部队。以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营国家的伟大团结和军事上的合作和互助，是保卫和平的主要支柱和动力。
    现在的世界力量对比，优势决不在帝国主义战争阵营方面。现在的人民再也不是可以听从战争势力摆布的人民。世界上越来越多的人民正在清醒地把自己的命运掌握在自己手里，他们将同以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营站在一起，坚决为反对实施巴黎协定，保卫和平而斗争。以美国侵略集团为首的战争势力如果不肯安静一些而一定要冒险，那末，等着它们的就一定是比希特勒和日本军国主义更为悲惨的命运。
