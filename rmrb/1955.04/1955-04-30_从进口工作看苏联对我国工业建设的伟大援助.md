From Import Work to See the Great Assistance of the Soviet Union to China's Industrial Construction
Director of the Import Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, Zhang Huadong

	This year is the third year of China's planned construction. On the "May Day" festival, which reviews the achievements of labor, looking back at the achievements of China's industrial construction in the past few years, I deeply feel that the victory we have achieved is inseparable from the great assistance of the Soviet Union to us.
	On April 19, 1950, the governments of China and the Soviet Union signed the Sino-Soviet Trade Agreement. By 1954, the total value of import and export trade between China and the Soviet Union had increased fourfold compared to 1950. Over the years, more than 95 percent of these materials imported from the Soviet Union have been means of production needed for China's industrial construction. These include complete sets of equipment for newly built enterprises such as the Anshan Large Rolling Steel Mill, Seamless Steel Tube Plant, Harbin Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Plant, and Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Plant; including various heavy machinery, precision instruments, high-quality steel and other important raw materials. These equipments are not only the most advanced in technology and the best in quality, but also key equipments essential for China's industrial construction, which are insufficient in domestic production or cannot be manufactured, and which capitalist countries are unwilling to sell to us. This shows that without the assistance of the Soviet Union, it would be difficult for us to carry out such large-scale construction and achieve such great achievements in such a short period of time.
	It is not an easy task for the Soviet Union to supply China with such a large amount of construction equipment. Among the core of China's first five-year plan—the 156 industrial enterprises designed with the help of the Soviet Union—50% to 70% of the main equipment will be supplied by the Soviet Union. In addition, many important equipments for the construction of other enterprises must also be ordered from the Soviet Union. In total, China imports more than several million tons of materials from the Soviet Union every year. This is a very large number. Completing these orders essentially means helping China, a large economically backward country, to be technically equipped in a few years and become a country with an independent heavy industrial base. This is an extremely arduous task. As far as I know, thousands of factories in the Soviet Union have been mobilized to complete China's orders. The great internationalist spirit of this comprehensive, long-term and selfless assistance to brother countries is indescribable.
	In our daily work contact, we can specifically experience the unparalleled sincere friendship of the Soviet Union to us everywhere. For example, due to our lack of experience and knowledge, we often missed ordering some goods when signing contracts, or originally planned to manufacture them ourselves, but later found that they could not be manufactured, or the specifications and varieties changed. All these require supplementary orders from the Soviet Union or amendments to the signed contracts. The Soviet Union is a country with a high degree of planning. A change in an order will not only disrupt the production plan of a factory, but also affect the production arrangements of many factories. However, the Soviet Union adopted an attitude of understanding towards these shortcomings and always overcame all difficulties to meet our requirements. Once, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant had three hundred lathes, which were originally determined to be supplied domestically, but later found it difficult to manufacture, and then submitted a supplementary order to the Soviet Union. No matter how difficult this request brought, the Soviet Union still generously agreed and temporarily changed its own plan arrangements, and finally ensured that the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant completed the installation task as scheduled. For another example, when the severe winter was approaching last year, there was an insufficient distribution of winter axle oil in China, and some trains in the Northeast region were about to stop running, and the situation was very tense. At this time, we asked the Soviet Union for help. After receiving this request, the Soviet Union immediately allocated vehicles, and in just half a month, 80% of the oil we needed was shipped from the Soviet Union.
	We also have some orders that the Soviet Union does not currently produce, and they also try their best to overcome difficulties to ensure supply. For example, this year, we requested the Soviet Union to order thick steel plates for the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, and the width size exceeded the Soviet Union's production standards, making it difficult to supply. However, after we reflected on the domestic needs, the manager of the Soviet Foreign Trade Company managed to find the design drawings of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and personally convened engineers from the industrial sector to study together. Finally, in order not to change the engineering design of China's Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, they changed the production equipment in the workshop to meet our requirements. Moreover, the product qualification rate for manufacturing this kind of high-quality steel plate of a certain size is relatively low, and the loss is great, but the Soviet Union still does not hesitate to pay the highest price to ensure China's construction.
	The Soviet Union not only demonstrated such a lofty spirit of internationalism in undertaking orders, but also dispatched experts to help us install and teach us how to use the equipment after delivery. For example, the machine tool experts sent by the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Trade to China last year successively carried out nine months of work in twenty-five factories in eleven industrial cities including Harbin, Shenyang, and Fushun. They not only solved the technical problems of installation, operation, maintenance, and maintenance of key equipment that various factories could not solve for a long time, but also generally improved the technical level of workers in various factories. In the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory, Soviet experts personally installed large machine tools to conduct on-site teaching. One of the machine was a five-meter vertical lathe, the machine tool weighed one hundred and forty tons, and was nine and a half meters high. The expert used advanced working methods to install it successfully in only thirteen days. Under the guidance of experts, the factory has now trained an excellent large-scale machine installation team.
	On the one hand, the Soviet Union takes care of our needs in every possible way to maximize our needs. On the other hand, it also strives to promote the independence of China's industry. Unlike capitalist countries, which try to increase the dependence of importing countries on them in order to seize profits. This can be illustrated by the following two points. First of all, the 156 key projects with the main equipment supplied by the Soviet Union are to lay the foundation for the independence of China's industry, so that China will no longer have to rely on imports from foreign countries in the future, and can manufacture various means of production it needs. This is something that no capitalist country is willing to do. Secondly, in the current ordering work, the Soviet Union is also strictly abiding by this principle: the Soviet Union is unwilling to accept orders for anything that China can manufacture itself and can trial-produce with existing equipment. Instead, it provides us with various valuable drawings and technical data free of charge, and dispatches experts to help us manufacture them. Some of our comrades find it troublesome and afraid of difficulties, and want to order from the Soviet Union what they can do themselves. The Soviet comrades sincerely criticized this phenomenon and asked us to correct it. This strict principle and high concern for China's industrialization are very profound for our education.
	What I have talked about above is only a part of what I have experienced in import work. The assistance of the Soviet Union to us cannot be fully explained in such a short article. We can only learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union with a hundred times of effort, overcome the shortcomings in our work, and do a good job in the construction entrusted to us by the people to answer our great and dear friend - the Soviet Union.

    从进口工作看苏联对我国工业建设的伟大援助
    对外贸易部进口局局长　张化东
    今年是我国进入有计划建设的第三年了。在“五一”这个检阅劳动成果的节日，回顾几年来我国工业建设的成就，深深感到我们所获得的胜利和苏联对我们的伟大援助是分不开的。
      一九五○年四月十九日，中苏两国政府签订了中苏贸易协定。到一九五四年，中苏两国之间的进出口贸易总额已经增长为一九五○年的四倍。历年来，这些从苏联进口的物资中，有百分之九十五以上都是我国工业建设所需要的生产资料。其中包括鞍山大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、哈尔滨量具刃具厂、沈阳风动工具厂这些新建企业的成套设备；包括各种重型机械、精密仪器、优质钢材和其他重要的原材料。这些器材不仅在技术上是最先进的，质量是最优良的；而且是我国工业建设上必不可少的关键性的器材，是我国国内生产不足或不会制造而资本主义国家又不肯卖给我们的器材。这说明了，如果没有苏联的援助，我们要在这样短促的时间内展开这样大规模的建设，取得这样大的成就，是很困难的。
    苏联给我国供应这样大量的建设器材，并不是一件轻松的事。我国第一个五年计划的核心——苏联帮助我国设计的一百五十六个工业企业中，有百分之五十到七十的主要设备将由苏联供应。除此之外，其他企业的建设也有许多重要的器材是要向苏联订购的。总计起来，我国从苏联进口的物资，每年都在几百万吨以上。这是一个非常庞大的数字。完成这些订货，实质上意味着要在几年之内帮助中国这样一个经济落后的大国，从技术上装备起来，成为一个有独立的重工业基础的国家。这是一个极其繁重的任务。据我所知，为了完成我国的订货，苏联所动员的工厂有成千上万个。这种全面的、长期的、无私的援助兄弟国家的伟大国际主义精神，给人的感动是无法形容的。
    在我们日常工作的接触中，更是处处具体地体验到苏联对我们的无比真挚的友谊。例如，由于我们的经验和知识不足，在签订合同时，往往有些货物漏订了，或者原定自己制造，后来又发现不能制造，或者是规格品种发生了变化。这些都要向苏联补充订货或修改已经签订好的合同。而苏联是一个有高度计划性的国家，一项订货的变动，不仅要打乱一个工厂的生产计划，而且联系到许多工厂的生产安排都要受到影响。但是，苏联对我们这些缺点采取了谅解的态度，总是克服一切困难来满足我们的要求。有一次，第一汽车制造厂有三百台车床，原来确定由国内供应，后来发现制造有困难，又向苏联提出补充订货。不管这个要求带来的困难有多么大，苏联还是慨然地应允了，临时改变了自己的计划安排，终于保证了第一汽车制造厂如期完成了安装任务。再如去年严冬快要到来的时候，国内的冬用车轴油不敷分配，东北地区部分火车将要停驶，情况十分紧张。这时我们就向苏联提出要求给予帮助。苏联接到这个要求，马上调配车辆，刚刚半个月，我们需要油量的百分之八十就从苏联启运了。
    我们还有些订货是苏联目前不生产的，他们也想尽办法克服困难来保证供应。例如今年向苏联提出订购建造武汉长江大桥用的厚钢板，宽度尺寸超出苏联的生产标准，供应很困难。但是经我们反映国内需要以后，苏联对外贸易公司的经理设法找到了武汉长江大桥的设计图纸，亲自召集工业部门的工程师共同研究。最后为了不改变我国武汉长江大桥的工程设计，他们改变了车间的生产设备，满足了我们的要求。而且制造这种质量很高的一定尺寸的钢板，产品合格率比较低，损失很大，但苏联仍不惜付出最高的代价来保证我国的建设。
    苏联不仅在承制订货中间表现了这样崇高的国际主义精神，而且在交付订货以后，还专门为了所订的设备派遣专家来帮助我们安装，和教给我们使用。例如去年苏联对外贸易部派来我国的机床专家，先后在哈尔滨、沈阳、抚顺等十一个工业城市的二十五个工厂进行了为期九个月的工作，不仅解决了各厂长期不能解决的关键性设备的安装、操作、检修、保养等技术问题，而且普遍提高了各厂工人的技术水平。在哈尔滨电机厂，苏联专家亲自动手安装大型机床来实地教学。有一台五公尺立式旋床，机床全重一百四十吨，高九·五公尺，专家用先进的工作方法，仅十三天就安装成功了。在专家的指导下，现在这个工厂已经训练成了一支出色的大型机器安装队。
    苏联一方面以无微不至的关怀，最大限度地满足我们的需要，另一方面又极力促进我国工业的独立。不像资本主义国家，为了攫取利润，竭力设法加大进口国家对他的依赖。这可以举下面两点来说明。首先，由苏联供应主要设备的一百五十六项重点工程，就是为了给我国工业的独立打下基础，使我国以后再不要仰赖从国外进口，而可以自己制造所需要的各种生产资料。这一点是任何一个资本主义国家也不肯做的。其次，在目前订货工作中，苏联也是严格遵守着这个原则：凡是我国自己能够制造的，和运用现有设备可以试制的，苏联都不肯承受订货。而是无代价地供给我们各种宝贵的图纸和技术资料，并且派遣专家来帮助我们制造。我们有些同志嫌麻烦、怕困难，自己能够做的也要向苏联订货，对这种现象，苏联同志诚恳地提出批评，要求我们纠正。这种严格的原则精神和对我国工业化事业的高度关怀，对我们的教育是非常深刻的。
    以上所谈的这些，仅仅是我在进口工作中所体会到的一部分。苏联对我们的帮助，在这样一篇短文当中，是无法说全的。我们只有以百倍的努力来学习苏联的先进经验，克服工作中的缺点，做好人民交付给我们的建设事业，来回答我们伟大的亲爱的朋友——苏联。
