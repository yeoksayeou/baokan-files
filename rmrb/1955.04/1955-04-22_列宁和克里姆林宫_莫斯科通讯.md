    Lenin and the Kremlin
    -- Moscow Dispatch
    Xinhua News Agency Correspondent in Moscow, Li Nan
    In our time, the Moscow Kremlin is not only a historical monument of a great nation, but also the starting point of a new chapter in human history. When people come to the center of Moscow and see the ancient five spires, topped with huge red stars, rising above the crenellated palace walls on a green hill, when we think with deep respect of the many poets who have sung the praises of the Kremlin, we cannot help but recall Mayakovsky's line: "As everyone knows, the land begins with the Kremlin."
    This is the greatest of glories, the greatest of memorials, the first Soviet workers' and peasants' regime in human society established in the Kremlin.
    In March 1918, the capital of the young Soviet Republic was moved from Petrograd to Moscow. The leaders of the Soviet regime came to the Kremlin. "We are in the Kremlin," those who were with Lenin said. "Yes, we are in the Kremlin," Lenin replied briefly, and then continued, "Here, the workers' and peasants' regime must be completely and thoroughly consolidated."
    Lenin's plan was realized. In the heart of the ancient Russian capital, the rule of the working people was consolidated, a regime that created the first socialist country, setting a reliable example for the working people of the world to break free from enslavement and exploitation.
    Lenin lived and worked in the Kremlin, which gave the Kremlin a new significance forever. In the Kremlin, there are many places that are unforgettable and cherished by the people; they are linked to the name of the great Lenin.
    Lenin worked in the Kremlin. Lenin's office is in the Kremlin—this is the thought that naturally comes to mind first as we enter the Kremlin's vermilion palace walls. If you enter through the Spassky Gate, the first thing that comes into view is a huge building with a red flag flying above its dome. This is the building built by the outstanding Russian architect Kazakov from 1776 to 1787 during the reign of Catherine II. On the third floor of this building, near the Nikolsky Gate, is Lenin's office, where he lived and worked.
    The room is not large. In the room is a small desk with three telephones on it, a desk lamp with a glass shade, and a candlestick for use during power outages. The stationery on the desk is kept as it was: sharpened pencils, a letter opener, a notebook, a calendar, and a small glue bottle. There are also file folders on the desk. The most important folder is placed in the center of the desk, with scissors on top of it—an indication that it should not be moved.
    Leaning against Lenin's desk is a long table covered with red felt, with four soft chairs on either side. These were for visitors to sit on.
    On the wall by the fireplace on the right is a map of Russia, on which Lenin personally marked the positions of enemy forces on the front lines during the civil war. On the other wall are maps of the European and Asian parts of Russia and a railway map. On all sides are bookshelves and magazine racks.
    Lenin's office in the Kremlin was so simple and unadorned. In this small room, Lenin worked tirelessly, thinking not only about the present, but also planning for the future—the future of socialism and communism.
    Lenin's office led directly to the meeting hall where the Council of People's Commissars met. In the days from 1918 to 1919, meetings were held here every evening, except on Sundays, until late at night. In Lenin's office and in the meeting hall of the Council of People's Commissars, important issues of the young Soviet Republic were decided. Here, the wisdom and determination of Lenin and his comrades shattered the enemy's attempts and laid the foundation for the Soviet state.
    In Lenin's office in the Kremlin, Lenin received delegations of workers and peasants, talked with his comrades, prepared speeches for Party and Soviet meetings, and handled the daily affairs of state life.
    Anyone who has seen the famous painting by the artist Serov, "Peasant Delegates with Lenin," cannot help but be moved by the sincerity expressed in the painting. In the spring of 1918, in the building where Lenin was located, one could also see the same scene as in the Smolny Palace in Petrograd in the winter of 1917. In the corridors of the building, representatives of workers and peasants from all over the country and Red Guard soldiers were coming and going. Lenin personally received ordinary working people, talked to them, and learned about their demands. This was the most vivid connection between the revolutionary leader and the masses of the people.
    Living in the Kremlin, Lenin cared about the people all over the country. Every day, a large number of letters addressed to "Moscow, the Kremlin, Comrade Lenin" were sent here. He read these letters in his office. Lenin was concerned about the living conditions of the actors of the Maly Theater, and also noticed the request for assistance from the widow of the famous Russian geologist Mushketov. In Gorky's memoirs of Lenin, we also read about Lenin's concern for the health of his comrades.
    Of course, Lenin's connection with the people was not limited to the walls of the Kremlin. He often left the Kremlin to speak at mass rallies and workers' gatherings. In the Trekhgorny textile factory, the Ilyich factory, and the Moscow Polytechnic Museum, we can see the memorable places where Lenin once spoke.
    In the Kremlin, not far from the "Tsar Bell," in May 1920, Lenin participated in a "Communist Voluntary Saturday" here. Together with the Kremlin staff and Red Army soldiers, he moved wood and scrap iron there. Lenin's enthusiasm for labor moved the people who worked with him.
    The Kremlin was damaged in the war in 1917. In the midst of his busy work, Lenin still set aside time to pay attention to the restoration of the Kremlin. In May 1918, Lenin ordered the repair of the tower of the Nikolsky Gate to begin. The Spassky Bell Tower was also repaired by a specialized mechanic found by Lenin. The restoration of the Kremlin is still continuing to this day, and the restoration of the last of the three famous cathedrals is nearing completion.
    The Andreyevsky Hall in the Kremlin was the place where Party congresses and Comintern meetings were held in the past. Lenin often gave speeches in this hall. When the Comintern was in session, representatives from various countries heard Lenin's inspiring words here. "Whenever Lenin spoke in the Andreyevsky Hall, the front of the stage was so crowded that people were piled up on the chairs and tables. ... The final figures in Lenin's speeches were often drowned out by thunderous applause." This is Qu Qiubai's description of the grand occasion of Lenin's speech in the Andreyevsky Hall. Lenin's voice penetrated the walls of the Kremlin, inspiring the people fighting the White Guards and imperialism.
    The shameful intervention of imperialism failed. In the Kremlin, Lenin formulated the plan for restoring the national economy and the plan for the electrification of all of Russia. Lenin envisioned the socialist future, and under his firm guidance, the ideal was immediately put into practice. "The Russia of the New Economic Policy will surely become a socialist Russia," Lenin expressed the people's foresight and conviction at the Moscow Soviet Plenary Session in November 1922.
    The Soviet regime was consolidated. In December 1922, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was established.
    On December 12 of that year, Lenin worked for the last time in his own office in the Kremlin. On October 19, 1923, Lenin came to the Kremlin from Gorki sanatorium for the last time.
    After Lenin, Stalin lived and worked in the Kremlin. The Kremlin is the seat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the government. Many important resolutions and orders are issued from here, and many important meetings are held here.
    People all over the world hear the voice of the Kremlin, hear the Kremlin's call to fight for peace. Moscow Kremlin, these words remind people of a great image—the genius of mankind, Lenin.

    列宁和克里姆林宫
    ——莫斯科通讯
    新华社驻莫斯科记者　李楠
    在我们这个时代，莫斯科的克里姆林宫不单是一个伟大民族的历史的纪念物，而且还是人类历史的新篇页的起点。当人们来到莫斯科的中心，看到在一绿色的山岗上，在雉堞林立的宫墙中间，古老的五座尖塔上擎着巨大的红星时，当我们怀着深深的敬意想起许多诗人歌颂克里姆林宫的诗句时，我们不禁也会想起马雅柯夫斯基的诗句：“像大家所知道的一样，土地开始于克里姆林。”
    这是光荣中的最大光荣，纪念中的最大纪念，人类社会中第一个苏维埃工农政权确立在克里姆林宫。
    一九一八年三月，年青的苏维埃共和国的首都从彼得格勒迁到了莫斯科。苏维埃政权的领导者们来到了克里姆林宫。“我们在克里姆林”，——和列宁一道的人这样讲着。“是的，我们在克里姆林。”——列宁简短地回答，并且接着说：“在这里，应该完全彻底地巩固工农政权。”
    列宁的计划实现了。在俄罗斯古都的心脏，劳动人民的政权巩固下来了，这个政权缔造了第一个社会主义的国家，给世界劳动人民树立了摆脱奴役和剥削的可靠的榜样。
    列宁曾经生活和工作在克里姆林宫，这使克里姆林宫永远赋有新的意义。在克里姆林宫，有许多对于人民说来是永志难忘的地方，是衷心珍爱的角落；那里联系着伟大的列宁的名字。
    列宁曾工作在克里姆林。列宁的工作室在克里姆林——我们走进克里姆林宫朱红色的宫墙时，脑际中会自然最先浮起这种想法。如果从斯巴斯基大门进来，首先映入眼廉的是一座圆屋顶上飘着红旗的巨厦。这是叶卡切林娜二世时代俄罗斯卓越建筑师卡扎科夫从一七七六到一七八七年间的建筑。就在这座大厦三楼上靠近尼古里斯基大门的一边，那儿就是列宁的工作室，列宁在那儿生活和工作过。
    房间并不大。屋子里有一张不大的书桌，上面摆着三部电话机。一盏玻璃灯罩的台灯和供停电时使用的腊烛台。桌子上的文具保持着原来的样子：削过的铅笔、裁书页用的小刀、记事册、日历和小胶水瓶。在书桌上，还陈列着文件夹。最重要的文件夹放在桌子的中间，上面压着剪刀，——不准挪动的表示。
    横靠着列宁书桌的是一张铺着红毡的长桌，两边共有四把软椅。这是供来拜访的人坐的。
    在右边壁炉的墙上，挂着俄国地图，列宁在图上亲自作了记号，表示在国内战争前线上敌军的位置。在另一边墙壁上挂着俄罗斯欧洲部分和亚洲部分地图以及铁路交通图。四边都是书橱和放报刊的架子。
    列宁在克里姆林宫的工作室就是这样的简单朴素。就在这间不大的屋子里，列宁永远不知疲倦地工作着、思索着，不仅掌握着现在，并且计划着未来——社会主义和共产主义的未来。
    列宁的工作室直通人民委员会开会的会议厅。在一九一八年至一九一九年的日子里，这里除星期日外，每天晚上都要举行会议，直到深夜。在列宁的工作室和人民委员会的会议厅里，决定着年青的苏维埃共和国的重大问题。在这里，列宁和他的战友们的智慧和毅力粉碎了敌人的企图，奠定了苏维埃国家的基础。
    在克里姆林宫列宁的工作室里，列宁接见工人和农民的代表团，和自己的同志们谈话，准备在党和苏维埃会议上的讲演，处理国家生活的日常事务。
    看过画家谢罗夫的名画“农民代表和列宁在一起”的人，谁不被这幅画所表露的真情所感动呢？一九一八年春天，在列宁所在的这座建筑物里，也可以看到一九一七年冬天在彼得格勒斯莫尔尼宫一样的情景。在建筑物的走廊里，来往着各地来的工人和农民的代表们，和赤卫军的战士们。列宁亲自接见来访的普通劳动者，和他们谈话，了解他们的要求，这是革命领袖和人民群众之间的最生动的联系。
    生活在克里姆林宫里的列宁关怀着全国各地人民。每天有大批写着“莫斯科，克里姆林宫，列宁同志”的信件寄到这里。他在自己的工作室阅读这些信件。列宁曾经关心过小剧院演员的居住条件，也曾注意到著名的俄国地质学家穆什克托夫的孀妇向他提出来的生活上的请求。我们在高尔基回忆列宁的著作里，也读到过列宁关心自己同志健康的情况。
    当然，列宁和人民的联系还不仅仅限于在克里姆林宫的宫墙里面。他常常离开克里姆林宫到群众和工人集会上去讲演。在莫斯科的三山纺织厂、伊里奇工厂、莫斯科综合技术博物馆等地方，我们都可以看到列宁曾经演说过的值得纪念的地方。
    在克里姆林宫离“钟王”不远的地方，一九二○年五月列宁曾经在这儿参加了“共产主义义务星期六”，他同克里姆林宫的工作人员和红军战士一起，在那里搬运木头和废铁。列宁劳动的热情感动了同他一起劳动的人们。
    克里姆林宫在一九一七年的战争中受到了损害。在繁忙的工作中，列宁仍然分出时间来注意克里姆林宫的恢复工作。一九一八年五月，列宁命令开始修复尼古里斯基大门的塔楼。斯巴斯基钟楼也是列宁找来的专门机械师修复的。克里姆林宫的修复工作一直到现在还继续着，三座著名教堂中最后一座的恢复工作快要完成了。
    克里姆林宫内的安德烈耶夫大厅是过去党代表大会和共产国际会议集会的地方。列宁常常在这个大厅内发表演说。共产国际开会时，各国的代表们在这里听到了列宁的激动人心的言辞。“安德烈耶夫大厅每逢列宁演说，台前拥挤不堪，椅上，桌上都站堆着人山。……列宁的演说，篇末数字往往为霹雳的鼓掌声所吞没。”这是瞿秋白对列宁在安德烈耶夫大厅演说盛况的叙述。列宁的声音透过了克里姆林的宫墙，激励着和白卫军、和帝国主义战斗的人民。
    帝国主义的可耻的干涉失败了。在克里姆林宫中，列宁拟定了恢复国民经济的计划和全俄电气化的计划。列宁理想着社会主义的远景，而且在他坚定的指导下面，理想立即付诸实施了。“新经济政策的俄罗斯一定会变成社会主义的俄罗斯”——一九二二年十一月列宁在莫斯科苏维埃全体会议上这样表达了人民的预见和信念。
    苏维埃政权巩固起来了。一九二二年十二月成立了苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟。
    这一年十二月十二日，列宁最后一次在克里姆林宫自己的工作室里工作。一九二三年十月十九日，列宁最后一次从高尔克疗养地来到克里姆林宫。
    继列宁之后，斯大林曾经在克里姆林宫生活和工作。克里姆林宫是苏联共产党和政府的所在地。许多重要的决议和命令就从这里发出，许多重大的会议就在这里举行。
    全世界人民都听到克里姆林宫的声音，听到克里姆林宫号召争取和平的声音。莫斯科克里姆林宫，这几个字使人想起一个伟大的形象——人类的天才列宁。
