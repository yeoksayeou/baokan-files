The Xiangxi No. 1 National Teachers College of Hunan Province is located on a small hill in Dongjiao, Jishou, the seat of the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture. The school was transformed from the Hunan Provincial No. 9 Normal School in August 1952, according to the demands of the Miao people. In the past few years, the state has allocated more than 1.3 billion yuan (old currency) to help build school buildings. Now, on this small hill, many brand-new buildings have been erected, including twelve teaching buildings, an auditorium that can accommodate more than 1,000 people, and a cafeteria. A science museum and a bathhouse will also be built soon. Many faculty and staff members have also moved into brand-new dormitories. Last year, the state equipped the school with a complete set of physical and chemical experimental instruments, medicines, and mineral and biological specimens, including 3,000x microscopes and 1/1000 gram precision balances. Teachers are also preparing to use slide projectors in some courses.

This year, this national teachers college has 679 students from the Miao and Han ethnic groups, including 142 Miao students, more than three times the number before liberation. The school has trained more than 300 Miao and Han primary school teachers for the autonomous prefecture. Thirteen Miao graduates have been recommended to Hunan Normal College, Beijing Normal University, and the Central South Institute for Nationalities to continue their studies. Many Han graduates who have been assigned to teach in the Miao area are welcomed and loved by the Miao people, and some have been selected as model primary school teachers in the autonomous prefecture.

The Miao students study very diligently. Shi Yongqi of Class 7 in the secondary normal department studied in a private school before liberation and worked as a primary school teacher after liberation. At that time, he could not even teach arithmetic for the third or fourth grade of primary school. In the second half of 1953, he was recommended to study at Xiangxi No. 1 National Teachers College. With the help of Han teachers and Han students, he scored 94 in algebra and 91 in geometry in the final exam last year, with a total average of more than 86 points in all subjects. When the students of Class 8 in the junior normal department (all of whom are Miao) started school last year, some of them could not understand the Han teachers, but because they asked questions diligently and studied hard, 23 of them, or more than 45% of the total number of students in the class, scored an average of 80 points or more in all subjects in the final exam. The Miao female students also study their favorite lace, ribbons, and patterns at school, and the Miao male students also have courses in boxing, sword dancing, fork dancing, stick dancing, and lion dancing every week.

    在一所民族师范学校里
    新华社记者　一兆
    湖南省湘西第一民族师范学校设在湘西苗族自治州所在地——吉首东角一个小山岗上。这个学校是一九五二年八月根据苗族人民的要求，由湖南省立第九师范学校改成的。几年来，国家先后拨款十三亿多元（旧币）帮助兴建校舍。现在，在这个小山岗上，树立起许多幢崭新的建筑物，有十二个教学大楼，有一座可容一千人以上的礼堂，有食堂等。最近还要修一座科学馆和浴室。许多教职员工也都住上崭新的宿舍了。去年，国家给学校配备了全套理化试验仪器、药品及矿物和生物标本，其中有三千倍的显微镜和千分之一克的天平秤。教师们在有些课程中，还准备采用幻灯教学。
    今年，这所民族师范学校有苗、汉族学生六百七十九人，其中苗族学生一百四十二人，比解放前增加了两倍多。学校已为自治州培养苗、汉族小学师资三百多人。有十三名苗族毕业生，被保送到湖南师范学院、北京师范大学和中南民族学院继续进行学习。许多分配在苗区教书的汉族毕业生，受到苗族人民的欢迎和爱戴，有的人已被评选为自治州模范小学教师了。
    苗族学生学习都很用心。中师部第七班石永齐在解放前读过私塾，解放后做小学教师。当时他连小学三、四年级的算术都教不上来。一九五三年下半年，他被保送到湘西第一民族师范学校学习，在汉族老师和汉族学生帮助下，到去年年终期考时，他的代数考得九十四分，几何考得九十一分，各科总平均得八十六分多。初师第八班的学生（全是苗族），在去年开学时，有的还听不懂汉族老师的话，但由于他们勤问、苦学，到年终期考时，各科平均得八十分以上的就有二十三人，占全班总人数百分之四十五强。苗族女学生们在学校里还研究她们喜爱的花边、花带、图案等，苗族男学生们每周也有打拳、舞刀、舞钗、舞棍和舞狮子的课程。
