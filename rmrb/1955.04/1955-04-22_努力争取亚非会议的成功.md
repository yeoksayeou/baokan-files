    Efforts to Ensure the Success of the Asian-African Conference
    On April 19th, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his speech at the Bandung Conference: "Sixteen hundred million people of Asia and Africa are looking forward to the success of our conference. Countries and people all over the world who desire peace expect our conference to contribute to expanding the area of peace and establishing collective peace. Let us Asian and African countries unite and strive for the success of the Asian-African Conference!"
    Premier Zhou Enlai's speech fully conforms to the wishes of the Chinese people and the general aspirations of the people of Asian and African countries.
    As everyone knows, this historic and great gathering of Asian and African countries has been met with hostility and sabotage from the United States from the very beginning. The United States has been trying its best to use the differences in social systems among countries in the region and the estrangement and discord between certain countries caused by colonial rule to create disputes and undermine the Asian-African Conference. American propaganda organs have even openly stated that the United States wants to designate certain countries participating in the Asian-African Conference to be speakers of American opinions. However, the people of Asia and Africa are clearly aware that ensuring world peace, striving for and safeguarding national independence, and promoting friendly cooperation between countries for this purpose are the common aspirations of the people of our two continents. The Asian-African Conference embodies this common aspiration of ours. Therefore, we have a common basis for enhancing mutual understanding, seeking unity, and enabling the conference to achieve positive results. Premier Zhou Enlai said: "Our conference should seek common ground while reserving differences. At the same time, the conference should affirm these common aspirations and demands. This is the main issue among us."
    Premier Zhou Enlai's position of seeking common ground while reserving differences in order to strive for the success of the conference has been widely welcomed and praised by various countries at the conference. In the speeches of the representatives of the participating countries, many also expressed the same requirements. Indonesian President Sukarno pointed out in his opening speech: "We have a great deal in common," "Our task first is to reach understanding with each other, from understanding will arise greater respect for each other, and from respect will arise collective action." Indian Prime Minister Nehru has also repeatedly stated that the representatives of Asian and African countries meeting together in a friendly manner can "find a common basis for cooperation in the economic, cultural, or even political fields." It should also be noted that even in some speeches at the conference that held different opinions, it is not impossible to find this common ground.
    Do we have a basis for our efforts to seek common ground? Premier Zhou Enlai answered this question with complete certainty: "Yes. That is, the vast majority of Asian and African countries and peoples have suffered, and are still suffering, from the disasters and pain caused by colonialism since modern times. This is something we all recognize. From relieving the pain and disasters of colonialism, we can easily understand and respect each other, sympathize with and support each other, rather than suspect and fear each other, exclude and oppose each other. That is why we agree with the four objectives of the Asian-African Conference announced by the five-nation prime ministers' Bogor Conference and do not make other suggestions." It must be pointed out that there are certain estrangements and discords between some Asian and African countries, but these are caused by external colonialist forces, which are not in the interests and wishes of our Asian and African people. We have no reason to maintain and expand this estrangement and discord, but should try to eliminate it, and eliminating this estrangement and discord is an important contribution to world peace.
    For a long time, the US authorities have been using the banner of "anti-communism" to create division and opposition among Asian and African countries, thereby infringing upon the national independence of various countries. Unfortunately, at the Asian-African Conference, there were still representatives of individual Asian countries reciting the US's "anti-communist" clichés. However, human history shows that despite differences in ideology and social systems, countries can still coexist peacefully. An era can simultaneously have countries implementing feudal systems and countries implementing capitalist systems. Similarly, the Soviet Union, which pursued a socialist system, coexisted peacefully with capitalist countries for more than 30 years, and even jointly conducted a war against fascism with them and achieved a common victory.
    We Chinese people believe that our current people's democratic system is completely suitable for our country's conditions and the wishes of our people. We have chosen the current system after many years of tortuous and difficult struggles. We will never allow interference from other countries, and at the same time, we will never interfere with the choices of other peoples. We are willing to establish normal relations with all countries on the basis of peaceful coexistence, and in fact, our country has already established such relations with twenty-four countries in the past few years, and has established economic and cultural ties with more countries. Our people never interfere, and will not interfere in the future, in the internal affairs of the United States, but the United States occupies our territory of Taiwan, prevents the Chinese people from liberating their own Taiwan, and interferes in China's internal affairs. Our people never conduct, and will not conduct in the future, any subversive activities against any foreign country, but we are being threatened by American subversive activities. The US government has used a large amount of money and sent a large number of personnel for these subversive activities, and it does not conceal this point. We want to coexist peacefully with all countries, but the United States not only refuses to coexist peacefully with our country, but also tries its best to obstruct and undermine peaceful coexistence between countries, and strives to slander the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. But the Asian and African people have eyes. They will see clearly that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are good for everyone, while division, opposition, and war are of no benefit to anyone.
    The Colombo Conference countries initiated the convening of the Asian-African Conference, which had long revealed the four objectives of the conference, and the invited countries participating in the conference should agree with the objectives of the conference. It is very clear that the convening of the Asian-African Conference is not for the purpose of seeking disputes and opposition, but for the purpose of seeking understanding and mutual trust, promoting friendly cooperation, and maintaining peace in the region and the world. Therefore, countries participating in the Asian-African Conference should make joint efforts to prevent the conference from being sabotaged and to achieve the objectives of the conference. Relying on the support of millions of people, and relying on the joint efforts of the participating countries, the Asian-African Conference can achieve success. Premier Zhou Enlai is right: "The era of arbitrarily manipulating the fate of the Asian and African people is gone forever. We believe that if we are determined to maintain world peace, no one will be able to drag us into war; if we are determined to strive for and safeguard national independence, no one will be able to continue to enslave us; if we are determined to cooperate in a friendly manner, no one will be able to divide us." The people and governments of Asian and African countries must strive for the peace, independence, and friendship of Asian and African countries, and must not allow them to be sabotaged.

### 努力争取亚非会议的成功

    努力争取亚非会议的成功
    四月十九日，我国周恩来总理在万隆会议上的发言指出：“十六万万的亚非人民期待着我们的会议成功。全世界愿意和平的国家和人民期待着我们的会议能为扩大和平区域和建立集体和平有所贡献。让我们亚非国家团结起来、为亚非会议的成功努力吧！”
    周恩来总理的发言，完全符合中国人民的愿望，也符合亚非各国人民的普遍愿望。
    大家知道，亚非国家这次历史性的伟大集会，一开始就遭到美国的敌视和破坏。美国竭力利用这一地区各国社会制度的不同和殖民统治所造成的某些国家间的隔阂和不和，来制造纷争，破坏亚非会议。美国宣传机关甚至公开提出，美国要指定参加亚非会议的某些国家做美国意见的发言者。但是，亚非两洲人民却清楚地晓得，保障世界和平、争取和维护民族独立，并为此而促进各国间的友好合作，是我们两洲人民的共同愿望。亚非会议就体现着我们的这种共同愿望。因此，我们具有共同的基础来增进相互的了解，寻求团结，使会议取得积极的结果。周恩来总理说：“我们的会议应该求同而存异。同时，会议应将这些共同愿望和要求肯定下来。这是我们中间的主要问题。”
    周恩来总理所表明的这个求同存异来争取会议成功的立场，受到了会议各国的广泛欢迎和赞扬。在与会各国代表的发言中，很多也表示了同样的要求。印度尼西亚总统苏加诺在开幕词中指出：“我们是有非常多的共同之处”，“我们的任务首先是彼此取得谅解，从谅解中将产生彼此间的更大的尊重，从尊重中将产生集体的行动。”印度总理尼赫鲁也曾一再表示，亚非各国的代表友好地在一起开会，能够“设法寻求在经济、文化或甚至政治方面实行合作的共同基础”。还应当看到，就是在会议上持有不同意见的一些发言中，也不是找不到这种共同之处的。
    我们求同的努力，是否有基础呢？周恩来总理完全肯定地答复了这个问题：“有的。那就是亚非绝大多数国家和人民自近代以来都曾经受过、并且现在仍在受着殖民主义所造成的灾难和痛苦。这是我们大家都承认的。从解除殖民主义痛苦和灾难中找共同基础，我们就很容易互相了解和尊重、互相同情和支持，而不是互相疑虑和恐惧、互相排斥和对立。这就是为什么我们同意五国总理茂物会议所宣布的关于亚非会议的四项目的，而不另提建议。”必须指出，一些亚非国家之间存在着某种隔阂和不和，但这是外来的殖民主义势力所造成的，这并不符合于我们亚非人民的利益和愿望。我们没有理由保持和扩大这种隔阂和不和，只应该设法加以消除，而消除这种隔阂和不和，正是对于世界和平的一个重要贡献。
    长期以来，美国当局就打着“反共”的幌子，在亚非国家间制造分裂和对立，借此侵扰各国的民族独立。可惜在亚非会议上，居然还有个别亚洲国家的代，表背诵着美国的“反共”滥调。但是，人类历史却表明，思想意识社会制度尽管不同，各国还是可以和平共处的。一个时代可以同时有实行封建制度的国家和实行资本主义制度的国家。同样，奉行社会主义制度的苏联就同资本主义国家和平共处了三十多年，并且还同它们共同进行过反对法西斯的战争，取得了共同胜利。
    我们中国人民认为我国现行的人民民主制度是完全适合我国条件和我国人民愿望的，我们经过多年的曲折艰难的斗争才选择了目前的制度。我们决不能容许别国的干涉，同时我们也决不干涉别国人民自己的选择。我们愿意在和平共处的基础上同所有国家建立正常关系，并且事实上这几年来我国也已经同二十四个国家建立了这种关系，同更多的国家建立了经济和文化的联系。我国人民从不干涉，将来也不干涉美国的内政，但美国却侵占我国的领土台湾，阻挠中国人民解放自己的台湾，干涉中国的内政。我国人民对任何外国从不进行，将来也不进行任何颠覆活动，但是我们正遭到美国的颠覆活动的威胁，美国政府对这种颠覆活动用了大批的金钱，派出了大批的人力，而且是并不隐瞒这一点的。我们要同所有国家和平共处，而美国不仅不肯同我国和平共处，还千方百计地阻挠和破坏各国之间的和平共处，并竭力诽谤和平共处的五项原则。但是亚非人民都有眼睛。他们会看清，和平共处的五项原则对大家都好，分裂、对立和战争却是对大家毫无好处的。
    科伦坡会议国家发起召开亚非会议，早就揭示了会议的四个目的，被邀请国参加会议应该是同意会议的目的的。很显然，亚非会议的召开，决不是为了寻找纷争和对立，而是为了寻求谅解和互信，促进相互的友好合作关系，维护这一地区和全世界的和平。因此，参加亚非会议的国家都应该为防止会议遭到破坏，实现会议的目的而作共同的努力。依靠着千百万人民的支持，依靠着与会各国的共同努力，亚非会议是可以获得成就的。周恩来总理说得对：“任意摆布亚非人民命运的时代已经一去不复返了。我们相信，如果我们决心维护世界和平，就没有人能够把我们拖入战争；如果我们决心争取和维护民族独立，就没有人能够继续奴役我们；如果我们决心友好合作，就没有人能够分裂我们。”亚非各国人民和政府一定要争取亚非各国的和平、独立和友好，一定不能容许它们遭受破坏。
