(I) In November 1949, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a decision on the establishment of the Central and various levels of the Party's Discipline Inspection Committees. Since the establishment of the Central and various levels of the Party's Discipline Inspection Committees, under the leadership of the Central Committee and various levels of Party committees, they have inspected and handled a large number of cases involving violations of laws and discipline by Party members, cleared out some hopeless elements within the Party, and punished some Party members who had committed various serious mistakes. Through the inspection and handling of the above-mentioned cases, the Party's Discipline Inspection Committees have played an active role in eliminating bourgeois ideology within the Party, strengthening Party discipline, purifying and consolidating the Party's organization, and ensuring the correct implementation of the Party's line and policies.

(II) Currently, our country is realizing socialist industrialization, and socialist transformation is being carried out on agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. The complex and acute class struggle in society is constantly reflected in our Party's life from various aspects. At the same time, a phenomenon has occurred in many parts of the Party organization where ideological and political work is neglected because they are busy leading economic work and other specialized businesses. As a result, bad elements who have infiltrated the Party take the opportunity to act, and some unstable Party members also degenerate and change due to the erosion of bourgeois ideology, leading to many incidents of corruption, degeneration, and violations of laws and discipline. Recently, the serious incident of the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance conspiring to split the Party and seize the supreme power of the Party and the state occurred. In response to this situation, Party organizations at all levels must strengthen ideological and political work, strengthen the struggle against the sabotage activities of class enemies and unhealthy tendencies within the Party, and strengthen Party discipline. The current organization and powers of the Party's Discipline Inspection Committees at all levels can no longer adapt to the task of strengthening Party discipline in the new period of class struggle. Therefore, the National Congress of the Communist Party of China has decided to establish the Party's Central and local supervisory committees to replace the Central and local levels of the Party's Discipline Inspection Committees, in order to strengthen Party discipline and strengthen the struggle against various violations of laws and discipline among Party members, especially to prevent the recurrence of serious incidents that seriously endanger the interests of the Party, such as the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance.

(III) The current Central Supervisory Committee of the Party shall be elected by this National Congress of Party Delegates and approved by the plenary session of the Central Committee; the local supervisory committees of the Party at all levels (provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, cities, autonomous prefectures, special districts, counties, autonomous counties) shall be elected by the most recent Party congresses or representative meetings convened in the respective localities and approved by the Party committee at the next higher level. The Party's supervisory committees at all levels shall carry out their work under the guidance of the Party committees at all levels.

(IV) The task of the Party's Central and local supervisory committees at all levels is to regularly inspect and handle cases of Party members violating the Party Constitution, Party discipline, and national laws and decrees. Acts of Party members that violate national laws and decrees shall be handled by the Party's supervisory committees regarding any Party disciplinary actions, in addition to being tried by the people's courts or punished by the government's supervisory organs in accordance with the law.

The Party's Central and local supervisory committees at all levels have the right to inspect and handle all cases of Party members violating the Party Constitution, Party discipline, and national laws and decrees. If members of Party committees at all levels violate the Party Constitution, Party discipline, and national laws and decrees, they shall be dealt with by the Party committee at the same level; however, the Party's supervisory committee at the next higher level has the right to directly deal with them when it deems necessary.

When local supervisory committees at all levels conduct inspections of members of Party committees at the next higher level and members of Party committees at the same level, and when giving cadres within the cadre position title table managed by Party committees at the next higher level and at the same level punishments of removal from work or higher, they should obtain the consent of the Party committees at the next higher level and at the same level, respectively. If the local supervisory committee believes that the decision of the Party committee at the same level is inappropriate, it has the right to appeal to the Party committee at the next higher level.

The Party's Central and local supervisory committees at all levels have the right to inspect the Party organizations at the next lower level regarding cases involving violations of the Party Constitution, Party discipline, and national laws and decrees, and to submit opinions on handling them to the Party committee at the same level.

(V) All cases of Party members violating the Party Constitution, Party discipline, and national laws and decrees shall be handled uniformly by the Central and local supervisory committees at all levels, except for members of Party committees at the same level and those that should be handled by the Party's district committees and branches in accordance with the Party Constitution. Party committees at the county and city levels and above must regularly guide and support the Party's supervisory committees in carrying out regular and resolute struggles against all Party members who violate the Party Constitution, Party discipline, and national laws and decrees.

(VI) The Party's supervisory committee at the next higher level has the right to inspect the work of the supervisory committee at the next lower level, and has the right to review, approve, and change the decisions made by the supervisory committee at the next lower level on cases. The Party's supervisory committee at the next lower level shall report its work to the supervisory committee at the next higher level, and shall faithfully report all situations of Party members and Party organizations violating discipline.

All Party members have the obligation to report to the Party's supervisory committee the situations they know about Party members violating laws and discipline, and to help the Party's supervisory committee fight against Party members who violate the Party Constitution, Party discipline, and national laws and decrees.

(VII) The Party's Central and local supervisory committees at all levels must closely combine their work with the state's procuratorial organs and the supervisory organs of governments at all levels, in order to fully and effectively exert the role of the Party and the state's supervisory organs.

The Party's Central and local supervisory committees at all levels must establish regular contact with the trade unions, the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, the supervisory boards of cooperatives, and other mass organizations at all levels, and rely on these organizations to contact the broad masses and carry out their work.

(VIII) The Party's Central and local supervisory committees at all levels should establish working bodies, establish regular work, and formulate their own detailed rules of work.

All staff members of the Party's supervisory committees must faithfully perform their duties, establish a serious and responsible, realistic and truth-seeking work style, strictly abide by the Party Constitution, Party discipline, and national laws and decrees, set an example, firmly struggle against bad people and bad deeds, and correctly inspect and handle cases.

    中国共产党全国代表会议关于成立党的中央和地方监察委员会的决议
    （一九五五年三月三十一日通过）
    （一）中国共产党中央委员会在一九四九年十一月发布了关于成立中央和各级党的纪律检查委员会的决定。中央和各级党的纪律检查委员会成立以来，在中央和各级党委的领导下，检查和处理了大量的有关党员违法乱纪的案件，清除了党内的一些不可救药的分子，惩处了一部分犯有各种严重错误的党员。党的纪律检查委员会通过上述案件的检查和处理，对于清除党内的资产阶级思想，加强党的纪律，纯洁和巩固党的组织，保证党的路线、政策的正确执行，起了积极的作用。
    （二）现在我国正在实现社会主义工业化，对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业正在进行社会主义改造，社会上复杂的尖锐的阶级斗争正在不断地从各方面反映到我们党的生活中来。同时，党的组织的不少部分发生了因为忙于领导经济工作和其他专门业务而忽略思想政治工作的现象。因此，钻到党内来的坏分子就乘机活动，党内一部分不坚定的党员也因受到资产阶级思想侵蚀而蜕化变质，以致发生不少贪污、腐化、违法乱纪的事件，并在最近发生了高岗、饶漱石反党联盟阴谋分裂党、夺取党和国家的最高权力的严重事件。针对着这种情况，各级党组织必须加强思想政治工作，加强对阶级敌人的破坏活动和党内不良倾向的斗争，并加强党的纪律。目前党的各级纪律检查委员会的组织和职权已不能适应在阶级斗争的新时期加强党的纪律的任务，因此中国共产党全国代表会议决定成立党的中央的和地方各级的监察委员会，代替中央的和地方各级的党的纪律检查委员会，借以加强党的纪律，加强反对党员中各种违法乱纪现象的斗争，特别是防止像高岗、饶漱石反党联盟这一类严重危害党的利益的事件重复发生。
    （三）本届党的中央监察委员会由本次全国党代表会议选举，并由中央委员会全体会议批准；党的地方各级（省、自治区、直辖市、市、自治州、专区、县、自治县）监察委员会由各该地方最近召集的党的代表大会或代表会议选举，并由上一级党委批准。党的各级监察委员会在各级党委指导下进行工作。
    （四）党的中央和地方各级监察委员会的任务是经常检查和处理党员违反党章、党纪和国家法律、法令的案件。党员违反国家法律、法令的行为，除应依法由人民法院审理或政府监察机关惩处外，其应受党纪处分者即由党的监察委员会负责处理。
    党的中央和地方各级监察委员会有权检查和处理一切党员违反党章、党纪和国家法律、法令的案件。各级党委委员如有违反党章、党纪和国家法律、法令的行为，应由同级党委处理；但上级党的监察委员会认为必要的时候，有权直接加以处理。
    地方各级监察委员会在对上级党委委员和同级党委委员进行检查的时候，以及在对上级和同级党委所管理的干部职务名称表内的干部给以撤销工作以上的处分的时候，应分别征得上级和同级党委的同意。如地方监察委员会认为同级党委的决定不适当的时候，有权向上一级党委提出申诉。
    党的中央和地方各级监察委员会有权检查下级党的组织有关违反党章、党纪和国家法律、法令的案件，并向同级党委提出处理意见。
      （五）各级党委对一切党员违反党章、党纪和国家法律、法令的案件，除同级党委委员和按照党章应由党的区委和支部处理者外，均应交由中央的和地方各级的监察委员会统一办理。县、市以上各级党委必须经常地指导和支持党的监察委员会同一切违反党章、党纪和国家法律、法令的党员进行经常的坚决的斗争。
      （六）党的上级监察委员会有权检查下级监察委员会的工作，并有权审查、批准和改变下级监察委员会对案件所作的决定。党的下级监察委员会应向上级监察委员会报告工作，并忠实地报告一切党员和党的组织违反纪律的情况。
    一切党员有义务向党的监察委员会报告他所知道的党员违法乱纪的情况，并帮助党的监察委员会同违反党章、党纪和国家法律、法令的党员进行斗争。
    （七）党的中央和地方各级监察委员会必须同国家检察机关和各级政府的监察机关密切结合进行工作，以便充分有效地发挥党和国家的监督机关的作用。
    党的中央和地方各级监察委员会必须同各级工会、青年团、妇女联合会、合作社的监事会以及其他群众组织取得经常的联系，并依靠这些组织联系广大群众进行工作。
    （八）党的中央和地方各级监察委员会应设立办事机关，建立经常工作，并制定自己的工作细则。
    党的监察委员会的一切工作人员都必须忠实地履行自己的职责，树立严肃负责、实事求是的作风，以身作则地严格遵守党章、党纪和国家的法律、法令，坚定地对坏人坏事进行斗争，正确地检查和处理案件。
