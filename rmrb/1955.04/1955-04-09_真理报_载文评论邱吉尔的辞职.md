Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 7th (TASS): The "People's Daily" published an article by I. Alexandrov entitled: "On Churchill's Resignation." The author points out that Churchill's resignation a few weeks before the parliamentary elections scheduled for May is because, as a politician, his prestige has been lost to such an extent that he has become a certain obstacle to the Conservative Party's policy implementation on the eve of the election, and thus has been relegated to a secondary position.

The author writes that since May 1953, Churchill had stated more than once that he advocated convening a summit conference of major powers to resolve international disputes. But he did not put these statements into action. Just recently, Churchill said in the House of Commons that he had given way to the United States and agreed with the American opposition to convening a major power conference. Another fact that undermined Churchill's position as Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party was that he openly admitted last November that he had intended to use the German fascist army and German weapons against the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. And recently, just as the movement of the masses demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons reached its climax, Churchill defended the use of these weapons in the House of Commons, which caused even greater damage to his prestige. Churchill's consistent concessions to the American side have aroused serious domestic dissatisfaction. Churchill's policy led to the expansion of armaments, turning Britain into an American military base. This has weakened the position of the British Empire.

The British imperialist group accepted the demand for Churchill's resignation because Churchill, as a politician, had gradually lost his value to them. He lost his political prestige at home. Churchill's too open violation of the wishes of broad public opinion made it highly unlikely that his party would continue to hold power after the election.

The author finally points out that the American ruling group obviously hopes to continue to implement the policy of treating Britain as a "little brother" in the future. However, the final decision rests with the British people. The British people have become increasingly determined to rise up to defend the national interests of their country, strive to ease international tensions, and eliminate the threat of a new war.
Xinhua News Agency, London, April 6th: The British Treasury recently published an annual white paper entitled "Economic Survey." This white paper summarizes the financial and economic situation of Britain in 1954 and points out the prospects for 1955.

The "Manchester Guardian" believes that the information revealed in this white paper is "quite serious." It shows that since the second half of 1954, Britain's economic situation has deteriorated greatly. This is first reflected in international payments, which is an important indicator of Britain's economic situation. In the first half of 1954, Britain had a surplus of 172.2 million pounds in international payments, but in the second half, there was a deficit of 12 million pounds; similarly, in the entire sterling area, there was a surplus of 171.1 million pounds in the first half of 1954, but in the second half, there was a deficit of 164 million pounds.

The white paper admits that one of the main reasons for this situation is the increasingly fierce competition among countries in the capitalist world market. The white paper specifically mentioned the fact that West Germany and Japan are competing fiercely with Britain. It said that in 1954, "the increase in British exports was less than that of Germany and Japan, and Britain's share of world trade decreased compared with 1953."

In addition, the impact of the American economic crisis and the increase in the prices of imported goods are also reasons for the deterioration of Britain's economic situation.

The white paper points out that the revenue and expenditure situation of Britain and the entire sterling area continued to deteriorate in the first few months of 1955, and in the future, as competition from the United States, West Germany, Japan, and other countries becomes more and more fierce, Britain will have to conduct an "arduous struggle" in order to maintain its position in the world market.

The white paper also points out: "The government's overseas expenditures remain a heavy burden on the balance of payments." The white paper directly admits that the obligations undertaken by Britain due to the Paris Agreements that promoted the rearmament of West Germany will further increase the government's expenditure on maintaining overseas troops.

    “真理报”载文评论邱吉尔的辞职
    新华社八日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：“真理报”刊载了伊·亚历山德罗夫的一篇文章，题目是：“关于邱吉尔的辞职”。作者指出，邱吉尔在离开定在五月举行的议会大选前的几个星期辞职，是因为作为一个政治家，他的威信已经丧失到这样的地步：他已经成为保守党在大选前夕执行政策的某种障碍，因而被排挤到次要的地位去了。
    作者写道，从一九五三年五月起，邱吉尔曾不止一次地说过，他主张召开大国首脑会议来解决国际争端。但是他没有把这种言论付诸行动。就在最近，邱吉尔在下院说，他向美国让了步，同意美国反对召开大国会议的意见。破坏了邱吉尔作为政府首相和保守党领袖地位的另一事实是，他在去年十一月公然承认，他在第二次世界大战末期曾经打算利用德国法西斯军队和德军的武器来对付苏联。而最近，正当人民群众要求禁止原子武器和氢武器的运动达到最高潮的时候，邱吉尔却在下院为使用这些武器辩护，这件事给他的威望造成了更大的损失。邱吉尔对美国方面的要求的一贯让步，引起了国内严重的不满。邱吉尔的政策导致扩张军备，使英国沦为美国的军事基地。这使不列颠帝国的地位日形削弱。
    英国的帝国主义集团之所以接受邱吉尔的辞职要求，是因为邱吉尔这个人作为政治家来说，对他们的价值已经渐渐消失了。他在国内丧失了政治威望。邱吉尔过于公开地违背广大舆论的愿望，因而使他的党在大选之后大有可能不再继续当权。
    作者最后指出，美国统治集团显然指望今后仍能继续执行把英国当作“小伙计”的政策。然而，最后的决定权是操在英国人民手里的。英国人民已经愈来愈坚决地起来保卫祖国的民族利益，争取缓和国际紧张局势，消除新战争的威胁。英政府发表去年财经情况白皮书说明英国经济情况大大恶化
    新华社六日讯　伦敦消息：英国财政部最近发表了一年一度的名为“经济综览”的白皮书。这份白皮书总结了一九五四年英国的财政经济情况，并且指出一九五五年的前景。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”认为，这份白皮书透露出来的情况是“相当严重”的。它显示：从一九五四年下半年开始，英国的经济情况大大恶化了。这首先表现在作为英国经济情况的重要指标的国际支付方面。一九五四年上半年，英国在国际支付方面有一亿七千二百万英镑的盈余，但是下半年却产生了一千二百万英镑的逆差；同样，在整个英镑区，一九五四年上半年有一亿七千一百万英镑的盈余，而在下半年却有一亿六千四百万英镑的逆差。
    白皮书承认：造成这种状况的主要原因之一，是资本主义世界市场上各国竞争的日趋剧烈。白皮书特别谈到了西德和日本同英国激烈竞争的事实。它说，一九五四年，“英国出口的增加不及德国和日本，英国在世界贸易中所占的比重比一九五三年减小了”。
    此外，美国经济危机的影响和入口货价格的上涨也是造成英国经济情况恶化的原因。
    白皮书指出：英国和整个英镑区的收支情况在一九五五年开始的几个月里还在继续恶化，而在今后，随着美国、西德、日本等国的竞争越来越猛烈，英国将不得不为了保持自己在世界市场上的地位而进行一场“艰苦的斗争”。
    白皮书还指出：“政府在国外的开支仍旧是收支账上的一项沉重的负担。”白皮书直截了当地承认，英国由于促成武装西德的巴黎协定而承担的在西欧驻军的义务，将使政府用来维持海外驻军的开支进一步增加。
