    印度国会议员、社会名流集会讨论五项原则
    新华社新德里二日电　印度若干国会议员和社会名流三月三十一日在新德里宪法俱乐部举行了一次讨论会，讨论的题目是“印度在今天世界事务中的作用和世界和平的最好保证——五项原则”。讨论会由印度国会人民院议长加·瓦·马瓦兰卡主持。
    印度总理驻国会秘书拉克希米·梅农夫人在发言中谈到体现和平共处五项原则的中印两国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定以及周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理的联合声明。她说，和平共处的五项原则概括说来，就是彼此尊重主权和和平共处。
    梅农夫人说，印度赞成五项原则是由于它国内的需要，因为印度需要和平以求得政治和经济稳定，并发展同其他国家的贸易关系。她说，和平是我们国家的生存所必不可少的。
    德里经济学院院长维·卡·兰·瓦·拉奥在发言中谴责美国组织马尼拉条约集团，威胁亚洲的和平。他说，即将在万隆举行的亚非会议将促进和平事业，而且将是对马尼拉条约组织的一个有力的回答。
