To the Editor:

The phenomenon of overtime work has long existed in some factories in Hengyang City, especially at the end of the month, quarter, and year. For example, the state-owned Hengyang Mining Machinery Factory had over 33,600 hours of recorded overtime last year. According to imprecise estimates, so-called "voluntary overtime" without pay amounted to 80,000 hours in the second half of the year alone; and another 5,000 hours in January and February of this year. The joint state-private First Machinery Factory worked over 3,500 hours of overtime in the fourth quarter of last year, and over 800 hours from the beginning of this year to March 12; in addition, there were over 800 hours of "voluntary overtime."

What is the attitude of the administrative leaders of the factories towards overtime work? Some openly arrange it, setting overtime tasks at meetings; some encourage it in disguise, allowing workers to "contract" to complete larger tasks within a very short period of time; and some even use coercive methods. For example, Zhang Wanda, the director of the local state-owned Jianxiang Machinery Factory, once posted a notice stating that "those who do not work overtime will be dealt with as violating labor discipline" (this sentence was later removed by trade union officials). Some trade union organizations also use radio broadcasts and blackboards to praise overtime work, calling on workers to learn from it. Although these practices were criticized by the Municipal Party Committee's Industrial Department and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions last November, they have not been completely corrected. For example, Zhang Guoqi, the vice chairman of the trade union and deputy director of the carpentry workshop of the First Machinery Factory, still described the phenomenon that workers in several groups worked almost every day until 12 o'clock at night as a manifestation of the enhanced sense of responsibility of the group leaders after the reorganization of labor organization and a good phenomenon in the labor competition when summarizing the labor competition in his workshop in February this year.

Because the leaders arbitrarily arrange overtime work, many workers work continuously for fourteen or fifteen hours, or even more than twenty hours. After work, they are dizzy, weak, and unable to stand, which seriously damages their health. The workers' time for political and cultural studies has been squeezed out. A large number of workers participating in cultural studies in the First Machinery Factory have either failed or been expelled from study.

Because of overtime work, the workers are overtired, which not only leads to more production accidents and lower quality, but also fails to complete the tasks. At the end of last year, the First Machinery Factory mobilized workers to work overtime in order to avoid carrying over products to the next year; the workers rushed to complete the production tasks, but most of the products that were rushed out were scrapped. This factory has been rushing to work overtime for a long time, and has not completed the production plan in any month from June last year to the present. The Hengyang Mining Machinery Factory also worked overtime all year round last year, but most of the products still could not be delivered on time.

The frequent overtime work in some factories in Hengyang City exposes serious shortcomings in enterprise management. Local leading organs must immediately correct this erroneous practice, correctly promote the workers' labor enthusiasm, and continuously improve technology and labor productivity.

### 衡阳市部分工厂加班加点的现象严重

    衡阳市部分工厂加班加点的现象严重编辑同志：
    加班加点的现象，在衡阳市部分工厂长期存在着，特别是到了月末、季末和年末加班加点的情况就更为严重。例如，国营衡阳矿山机械厂去年全年有统计数字的加班就有三万三千六百多小时，不付加班费的所谓“义务加班”，据不精确的估计，光下半年就有八万小时；今年一、二月份又加了五千多小时的班。公私合营第一机械厂去年第四季度加班三千五百多小时，今年从年初到三月十二日又加了八百多小时班；另外“义务加班”的还有八百多小时。
    工厂的行政领导干部对加班加点采取什么态度呢？有的公开布置，在会议上确定加班任务；有的变相鼓励，让工人在很短的期限内“包干”完成较大的任务；个别的甚至采用强迫手段，像地方国营建湘机械厂厂长张万达曾贴布告宣称“不加班加点者以违犯劳动纪律论处”（后来这句话被工会干部抹掉了）。有些工会组织也用广播、黑板报来表扬加班加点现象，号召工人们学习。这些做法在去年十一月虽然受到市委工业部和市总工会的批判，但是并没有完全纠正。像第一机械厂工会副主席、木工车间副主任张国祺在总结今年二月份本车间劳动竞赛时，仍然把几个小组的工人差不多每天都工作到深夜十二点钟的现象，说成是整顿劳动组织后组长责任心加强的表现和劳动竞赛中的一个好现象。
    因为领导上随意加班加点，不少工人连续工作十四五小时甚至二十多小时，下班后就头昏脚软站不起，严重地损害了工人的健康。工人们的政治学习和文化学习的时间都被挤掉了，第一机械厂参加文化学习的工人就大批留级或被开除学习。
    因为加班加点，工人们疲劳过度，不但生产上的事故多、质量低，而且任务仍然完不成。去年年底第一机械厂为了不使产品跨年度，发动工人加班；工人们抢着把产量任务完成了，但赶出来的产品大部报废。这个厂长期突击加班，从去年六月到目前没有一个月完成过生产计划。衡阳矿山机械厂去年也是一年到头加班，但是大部分的产品还是不能按期交货。
    衡阳市部分工厂经常加班加点的现象，暴露了企业管理中有着严重的缺点，当地领导机关必须立即纠正这种错误做法，正确发扬工人的劳动热情，不断提高技术和劳动生产率。　贡义
