    Liulihe Cement Plant Completes First Quarter Plan
    The Liulihe Cement Plant completed its cement production task for the first quarter on the 25th, more than six days ahead of schedule.
    After completing the January plan, the plant's employees launched a 50-day safe operation campaign for the cement kiln from February 6th, which greatly reduced the ring formation phenomenon and initially reversed the quality accidents that had long existed in the clinker production workshop. For example, the number of ring formations was 28 in December 1954, 19 in January of this year, and decreased to 7 in February. In March, until the completion of the plan, there were only 4 times, of which a certain cement kiln operated safely for 45 days without accidents. In order to ensure the completion of the production task, the manufacturing workshop improved the lining board of a certain cement mill's three chambers, expanded the cement mill's volume and increased the crushing force, which increased the hourly index by 0.5 tons compared with the original plan. Mechanic Liu Feng modified the oil pump of the clinker crusher, putting the long-unused clinker crusher into production. In the first quarter of this year, most production shifts broke the planned hourly index of the main cement mill and set seven new records. (Li Chengfu)

    琉璃河水泥厂完成首季计划
    琉璃河水泥厂在二十五日提前六天多的时间完成第一季度水泥生产任务。
    这个工厂职工在完成一月份计划后，从二月六日起展开水泥窑安全运转五十天运动，使结圈现象大大减少，初步扭转了烧成车间长期存在的质量事故。如一九五四年十二月份结圈二十八次，今年一月份结圈十九次，二月份就降低为七次，三月份到完成计划止仅有四次，其中某号水泥窑安全运转了四十五天未出事故。制成车间为了保证生产任务的完成，改进了某号水泥磨三室衬板，扩大水泥磨容积和加大粉碎力，使小时指标比原计划提高零点五吨。机械员刘凤改装了熟料破碎机油泵，使长期不能用的熟料破碎机投入生产。在今年的第一季度中，大部分生产班都突破了主机水泥磨的计划小时指标，并出现了七个新纪录。　　（李诚夫）
