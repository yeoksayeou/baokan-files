Xinhua News Agency, April 29th, Washington Dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower answered reporters' questions at a press conference on the 27th.

	A reporter asked whether Dulles's talk on the 26th about negotiating a "ceasefire" with China represented a change in attitude compared to the U.S. State Department's statement on the 23rd. Eisenhower said: "I don't think it's a change in attitude." He added, "The change is largely superficial rather than substantial." It is known that the American press had boasted that Dulles's talk differed from the U.S. State Department's statement, which had aroused widespread dissatisfaction in public opinion both at home and abroad.

	Like Dulles, Eisenhower completely avoided the crux of the tense situation in the Taiwan area and even the Far East, which is the occupation of China's territory of Taiwan by U.S. armed forces. He repeated Dulles's proposal to negotiate a so-called "ceasefire" with China. Eisenhower did not explain that the United States and China are not at war, so how can there be talk of negotiating a ceasefire. He even said that the Chiang Kai-shek group "is not fighting," and the "ceasefire is purely a matter for the Chinese Communist Party." This completely exposed that the U.S. authorities' so-called negotiation of a "ceasefire" is merely to force the Chinese people to abandon their just demand for the liberation of Taiwan.

	Answering a question about the Austrian peace treaty, Eisenhower said he saw no need for a four-power summit between the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France at this time.

### 艾森豪威尔举行记者招待会  重复杜勒斯侵占我国台湾的老调

    艾森豪威尔举行记者招待会
    重复杜勒斯侵占我国台湾的老调
    新华社二十九日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔二十七日在记者招待会上答复记者们的问题。
    有记者问到杜勒斯二十六日关于同中国谈判
  “停火”的谈话同美国国务院二十三日的声明比较起来是否在态度上有了一些改变。艾森豪威尔说：
  “我并不认为这是改变态度”。他又说，“这个改变在很大程度上是表面的，而不是实质的”。人们知道，美国报界曾吹嘘杜勒斯的谈话不同于美国国务院的声明，而这个声明曾引起美国国内外舆论的广泛不满。
    艾森豪威尔同杜勒斯一样，他完全避而不谈台湾地区以至远东地区的紧张局势的症结是美国武装力量侵占中国领土台湾。他重复杜勒斯所提的同中国谈判所谓“停火”。艾森豪威尔没有说明，美国和中国并没有交战，如何谈得上谈判停火。他竟说蒋介石集团“并没有打仗”，“停火纯粹是在中国共产党的事”。这就完全暴露了美国当局的所谓谈判“停火”，只不过是要中国人民放弃解放台湾的正义要求而已。
    艾森豪威尔在回答有关对奥和约的问题时说，他看不出目前有什么举行苏、美、英、法四国最高级会议的必要。
