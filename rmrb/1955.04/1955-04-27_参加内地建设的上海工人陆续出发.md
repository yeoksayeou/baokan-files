    Shanghai Workers Depart Successively to Participate in Inland Construction
    Recently, another group of drivers and repair technicians from Shanghai Municipality departed to participate in national industrial construction in the interior. The first batch of sixty-four approved drivers and technicians left Shanghai on the morning of April 25th for work in Shaanxi. The second batch of more than three hundred people and the third batch of two hundred and forty people will soon follow, taking one hundred and sixty trucks to Qinghai, Shaanxi, and other places. The workers have a high enthusiasm for building the interior, and so far, more than 5,000 people have signed up. Many employees' family members encourage their sons and husbands to build the motherland's interior. Worker Liu Jianfei's wife, Wang Wenjing, wrote in a letter to the trade union: "I guarantee to take good care of the children at home and do a good job in housework to support my husband in participating in national construction." Young worker Jiang Hanchi postponed his wedding date in order to sign up for construction work. (Our correspondent in Shanghai)
