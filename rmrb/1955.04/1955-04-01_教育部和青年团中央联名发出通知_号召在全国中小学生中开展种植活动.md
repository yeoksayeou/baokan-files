    The Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China and the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League jointly issued a notice on the 30th calling for planting activities among primary and secondary school students nationwide.
    The notice stated that planting activities are an effective way of conducting knowledge education and labor education for primary and secondary school students in extracurricular "labor activities," and it is also an activity that children and young people love. Through this activity, children and young people can learn to use simple tools, apply the knowledge they have learned to labor practice, thereby acquiring preliminary planting techniques, expanding and consolidating classroom knowledge, and cultivating a love of labor and an interest in gardening in labor practice.
    In order to carry out planting activities well, education administrative organs at all levels and Communist Youth League committees at all levels must carefully lead the schools and Young Pioneers, and the schools should appoint teachers and counselors to be responsible for organizing and leading students to actively participate. In mobilizing students to carry out planting activities, the following points should be noted: 1. Generally, students above the higher primary level should participate in planting activities, and older students in the middle grades of rural primary schools can also participate. 2. Planting activities should mainly be carried out in schools. If the school garden is too small, students may be appropriately called upon to plant at home or use vacant land near the school (with the consent of relevant local organizations after consultation with the leadership). 3. Schools should adhere to the principle of adapting to local conditions when carrying out planting activities. The planting content should not be forced to be consistent. Sunflowers and castor beans can be planted, or the campus can be greened by planting various trees, flowers, vegetables, etc. 4. Schools with larger scales and better conditions can set up gardening or planting groups to organize some students from junior high schools and senior grades of primary schools to participate, and assign teachers to guide them in seed selection, fertilization, grafting, irrigation, pest control, pollination, cultivating new varieties, and other work to cultivate and consolidate their interest in research. 5. The purpose of planting activities is to educate children and young people. It is necessary to act in accordance with the principle of voluntariness and completely avoid the erroneous practices of coercion and pursuit of numbers. Planting activities must not hinder students' classes, self-study, and physical health. Students who are weak or sick should not participate. 6. Planting activities should be carried out in a planned and organized manner. A planting plan should be formulated based on the size of the garden, what is suitable for planting, how many students can participate, and how many tools are available, and the plan should be followed. Seeds (or seedlings), fertilizers, and tools must be prepared before planting. If the garden is too small or there are not enough tools, students should be organized to participate in shifts to avoid confusion and waste of manpower. 7. Schools should, as far as possible, contact experienced local farmers, farms, agricultural production cooperatives, agricultural technology extension stations, garden management departments, etc., to help them solve technical problems. 8. A summary should be made at the end of each semester to study the experiences and shortcomings of planting activities, in order to prepare for improving planting activities in the next semester. During the holidays, students who stay at school and live near the school should be organized to take care of the plants in shifts so that the activities are not interrupted and the results of the planting are guaranteed.

    教育部和青年团中央联名发出通知
    号召在全国中小学生中开展种植活动
    中华人民共和国教育部和中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会在三十日联名发出在全国中、小学生中开展种植活动的通知。
    通知说，种植活动，是课外“劳作活动”中对中、小学生进行知识教育和劳动教育的有效方式之一，也是少年儿童喜爱的一种活动。通过这个活动，可以使少年儿童学习使用简单工具，应用已经学得的知识于劳动实践，从而在劳动实践中，获得初步的种植技术，扩大和巩固课堂知识，培养热爱劳动的习惯和对园艺的兴趣。
    为了使种植活动很好地开展，各级教育行政机关、各级团委必须认真领导各学校与少先队，由各学校指定教师和辅导员，负责组织并领导学生积极进行。在发动学生进行种植活动的工作中，应注意以下几点：一、参加种植活动的一般应是高小以上的学生，农村初级小学中年级年龄较大的学生也可以参加。二、种植活动主要应在学校内进行。若学校园地过小，可适当号召学生在家里或利用学校附近空闲地种植（经领导商得当地有关组织同意）。三、各校开展种植活动，应该掌握因地制宜的原则，种植内容不要强求一致，可以种植向日葵、蓖麻，也可以绿化校园、种植各种树木花草、蔬菜等。四、规模较大、条件较好的学校，可以成立园艺或种植小组，组织初中和小学高年级的一部分学生参加，指定教师指导他们进行选种、施肥、嫁接、灌溉、除虫、授粉、培育新品种等工作，培养并巩固他们的钻研兴趣。五、种植活动的目的，是为了对少年儿童进行教育，必须按照自愿原则办事，完全避免强迫命令与追求数字的错误做法，进行种植活动时不得妨碍学生的上课和自习及身体健康。身体弱的和有病的学生不要参加。六、种植活动应有计划有组织地进行。根据园地多少、适宜种什么、有多少学生可以参加、有多少工具等情况制定种植计划，按计划进行。种植前必须准备种子（或树苗）、肥料、工具等。如果园地太小、工具不足，就应该组织学生轮流参加，以避免混乱和产生浪费人力的现象。七、学校应该尽可能与当地有经验的农民、农场、农业生产合作社、农业技术推广站、园林管理部门等取得联系，请他们帮助解决技术上的问题。八、每到学期末应进行总结，研究种植活动的经验和缺点等，以作下学期改进种植活动的准备。假期中应组织留校和家住学校附近的学生轮流照顾，使活动不致中断，保证种植的成果。
