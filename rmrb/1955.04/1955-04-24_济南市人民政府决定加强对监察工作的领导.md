Reaction to Criticism and Suggestions

    Jinan Municipal People's Government's letter: After the People's Daily published Comrade Wang Shangwu's letter on March 20 criticizing the "Jinan Municipal People's Government's lack of attention to supervisory work," we studied it and believe that Comrade Wang Shangwu's criticism is correct and in line with the actual situation. This is very helpful in helping us change our leadership style and strengthen supervisory work. Because we have not studied the central government's instructions and policies enough, and our understanding of the importance of supervisory work during the transition period is insufficient, there are serious bureaucratic styles of being busy with routine matters, not understanding the situation at lower levels, and not paying attention to the criticisms and demands of cadres. For several years, we have basically let supervisory work go unattended, and have not put supervisory work on the Jinan Municipal People's Government's due work agenda for serious study and discussion. Therefore, the People's Supervision Committee of the Municipal People's Government has long suffered from incomplete institutions and insufficient cadre strength, which has greatly affected the development of work. We should deeply examine and immediately correct this. In order to strengthen the leadership over supervisory work and quickly change the current abnormal situation, we have recently transferred a number of cadres and decided to discuss supervisory work regularly; and according to the instructions of the higher-level People's Committee, we are preparing to change the People's Supervision Committee of the Municipal People's Government into a Supervision Bureau, with one director and one deputy director each. At the same time, we will pay attention to strengthening policy study, fully promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and change the leadership style, in order to give full play to the enthusiasm of cadres and further improve various tasks.

    济南市人民政府决定加强对监察工作的领导
    济南市人民政府来信：三月二十日人民日报发表了王尚武同志批评“济南市人民政府不重视监察工作”的来信后，经我们研究，认为王尚武同志的批评是正确的，是符合实际情况的。这对帮助我们改变领导作风，加强监察工作，有很大帮助。由于我们对中央的指示、政策学习不够，对监察工作在过渡时期的重要性认识不足，存在着严重的事务忙乱、不了解下情、不注意倾听干部的批评和要求的官僚主义作风。几年来，对监察工作基本上是放任不管的，没有把监察工作提到市人民政府应有的工作日程上来，进行认真地研究和讨论。因而，市人民政府人民监察委员会长期以来机构不健全，干部力量不足，大大影响了工作的开展，我们应该深刻检讨和立即纠正。为了加强对监察工作的领导，迅速改变当前的不正常情况，最近我们已调配一部分干部，决定定期讨论监察工作；并根据上级人民委员会指示，准备将市人民政府人民监察委员会改为监察局，配备正副局长各一人。同时，注意加强政策学习，充分发扬民主，开展批评和自我批评，改变领导作风，以发挥干部的积极性，进一步改进各项工作。
