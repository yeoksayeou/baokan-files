Strengthen Cotton Planting Technology to Strive for a Bumper Cotton Harvest This Year
Yang Xiandong, Vice Minister of Agriculture

Our country has entered the third year of the First Five-Year Plan. In the past two years, due to severe natural disasters, cotton production in our country has failed to meet the original production increase targets. This has limited the development of China's textile industry and the ability to meet the growing needs of the people's lives to a certain extent. This year is a year of decisive significance for the country to complete the First Five-Year Construction Plan. According to the state's plan, this year's total national cotton output is required to increase by more than 4 million dan compared to last year. This task is arduous, but it must be completed.

At present, the rural cooperative movement is developing rapidly, the state continues to implement the policy of rewarding cotton planting, universally implements the cotton pre-purchase contract system, continues to improve the grain supply and cotton cloth unified sales work in cotton areas, and the supply of commercial fertilizers and agricultural machinery in cotton areas is also increasing compared to the past. In addition, we have accumulated a lot of experience in overcoming natural disasters and improving cultivation techniques over the past few years. These are all favorable conditions for achieving increased cotton production this year. The current way to increase cotton production in our country, in addition to appropriately expanding the cotton planting area in suitable cotton areas, mainly relies on increasing yield per unit area. Judging from the current cultivation situation in cotton areas, cotton planting technology in many areas (especially new cotton planting areas) is still very extensive. Cotton planting techniques such as variety selection, sowing, dense planting, seedling protection, fertilization, pest control, soil cultivation, and pruning have not been deeply and comprehensively taught and used. In order to ensure the completion of this year's cotton production increase plan and strive for a comprehensive bumper cotton harvest, it is very necessary to strengthen cotton planting technology work.

Do a Good Job in Cotton Sowing

Timely sowing has a significant effect on ensuring full growth of cotton plants, early maturity, reducing frost-affected cotton, and increasing yield. In recent years, many cotton areas have achieved certain results in this regard. This year, the soil moisture conditions in various cotton areas are generally good, which creates good conditions for timely sowing. Therefore, the leading departments in cotton areas should mobilize cotton farmers to complete the sowing work in a short period of time. Some cotton areas have the disadvantage of prolonging the sowing period in sowing, which should be overcome this year.

Cotton dense planting should be further promoted in conjunction with cotton sowing. Although appropriate dense planting is one of the important measures to increase production, some areas still have concerns about it due to insufficient publicity and education. For these areas that still have concerns about dense planting, it is necessary to strengthen publicity and education and do more comparative demonstrations. In addition, judging from the current dense planting situation in cotton areas, except for a few areas with excessive density, the density in general areas is not enough. For such areas, the number of plants should be appropriately increased on the original basis in coordination with cotton field management. Some provinces are preparing to further expand the area of ​​densely planted cotton fields this year, which is necessary.

Promote Seedling Protection Technology

Doing a good job in seedling protection and eliminating the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges in cotton fields is one of the important measures to increase cotton field yield at present. The missing seedling rate in general cotton fields in our country is often 10% to 20%, and even as high as 50%. It is wrong to turn a blind eye to this phenomenon of missing seedlings and think that "70% or 80% is not considered missing." This year, the quality of cotton seeds in many areas is not high, so it is necessary to ensure full seedlings by strengthening sowing and cultivation techniques. Improving the quality of cotton seeds, promoting the use of better sowing tools, improving sowing techniques, and preventing and controlling underground pests are all indispensable measures to reduce missing seedlings and ensure full seedlings, and should be paid attention to.

After the phenomenon of missing seedlings occurs in cotton fields, it is also very important to vigorously promote seedling replanting. Experience in recent years has proved that the effect of transplanting cotton seedlings is very good. In 1954, cotton transplanted in Jingyang County, Shaanxi Province, increased by 50.5% per mu compared with direct-sown cotton replanted after summer harvest. The method of transplanting cotton seedlings can not only be used for replanting seedlings in cotton fields, but also as a planting technique in the case of insufficient seeds or failure to sow in a timely manner. The comparative test results of cotton seedlings raised and transplanted by the Wanzhou Mountainous Area Agricultural Experimental Farm in Sichuan Province in 1954 and cotton in direct-sown fields showed that the yield of transplanted cotton was much higher than that of direct-sown cotton, and the maturity period was advanced by one month. Transplanted cotton is also more labor-saving than direct-sown cotton in management. Although this method of raising seedlings and transplanting has been successfully tested in a few areas, it has not been widely promoted. Agricultural scientific research and experimental departments and state-owned farms and special county farms in cotton areas can conduct some experiments and demonstrations on this technology.

Increase Fertilizer Accumulation and Improve Fertilization Methods

Due to the many rural work and tasks in the winter of 1954 and the spring of this year, some areas did not pay attention to fertilizer accumulation. Therefore, cotton areas generally feel a lack of fertilizer. Although the supply of commercial fertilizers to cotton areas has increased this year, it still cannot keep up with the needs of production. Therefore, the agricultural production leading departments in cotton planting areas should still seize the time to mobilize the masses to continue to accumulate fertilizer. At the same time, cotton farmers should also be told to use the commercial fertilizers that the government gives priority to cotton areas rationally. In the case of insufficient fertilizer, it is very important to improve fertilization methods and use fertilizer economically. According to understanding, there are still many problems in the method of using fertilizer in various places. The habit of spreading fertilizer (especially base fertilizer) is still very common. This method of fertilization is very wasteful. According to experiments, generally changing spreading fertilizer to strip application can increase fertilizer efficiency by about two times, and changing to hole application, the fertilizer efficiency can be increased even more. The specific method of strip or hole application is: dig ditches or holes on one or both sides of the cotton plant row, the depth of the ditch and hole is two to three inches, the fertilizer is applied into the ditch or hole, and then covered with soil immediately after application. This fertilization method can enable cotton plants to quickly absorb nutrients and fully exert the effectiveness of the fertilizer.

Universally Carry Out Pest Control Work

Cotton diseases and insect pests, especially some very harmful cotton insects (cotton aphids, red spiders, blind bugs, leafhoppers, leaf rollers, cotton bollworms, etc.) are one of the important factors causing cotton yield reduction. At present, our country has been able to produce a large number of agricultural machinery and pesticides, and has also accumulated a lot of experience in pest control. In order to meet the needs of large-scale cooperative production in cotton areas in the future, we should also create more experience in large-scale thorough pest control. In the past, many cadres lacked confidence in thorough pest control, and the leadership in the leadership of pest control work was generally more general calls and less specific leadership and supervision and inspection, which seriously affected the development of pest control work in cotton areas. In order to do a good job in this year's pest control work in cotton areas and ensure the completion of the cotton production increase task, in addition to preparing sufficient agricultural machinery and pesticides in a timely manner and vigorously mobilizing cotton farmers to actively control cotton diseases and insect pests, we should adopt timely and continuous control methods for certain very harmful cotton insects. For example, cotton aphids and red spiders in cotton areas occur quickly and spread widely, and these pests must be controlled in a timely and thorough manner. To prevent and control cotton insects, various preparations must be made in advance, and insect conditions must be detected at any time, so that once insect pests occur, forces can be immediately organized to carry out prevention and control. According to the experience of many areas in the past, a method of layer-by-layer responsibility and district contracting can be adopted in the work of preventing and controlling cotton insects. The personnel in charge of pest control work in various places should not only promptly supervise and inspect, but also help solve the problems existing in the work of preventing and controlling cotton insects. In addition, in recent years, some farms and farmers in cotton areas have created and improved some more efficient pest control equipment in pest control, such as: multi-head sprayers, bamboo tube powder sprayers, etc., which can be promoted and applied in various places according to conditions. At the same time, we should continue to pay attention to the creation and improvement of the masses in this regard.

Actively Promote Cotton Field Cultivation and Soil Hilling

Cotton field cultivation can loosen the soil, circulate air, increase soil temperature, promote fertilizer decomposition, remove weeds, and reduce water evaporation. Cultivation after rain can also avoid soil crusting. Experience has proved that it is necessary to carry out multiple cultivations in a timely manner during the growth period of cotton plants. Cultivation is especially necessary during the thinning to budding period. This year, the cooperative movement in cotton areas has been further developed, and the number of animal-powered cultivation implements promoted in cotton areas has increased. These are good conditions for increasing the number of cultivations in cotton fields and ensuring the quality of cultivation.

The technology of soil hilling in cotton rows (ie, soil accumulation) has been promoted in some cotton areas. Practice has proved that soil hilling can promote the development of cotton plant roots, increase fertilizer efficiency, increase yield, and appropriately resist wind, waterlogging, and drought. In coastal cotton areas with many typhoons, soil hilling is even more necessary to resist wind. Soil hilling in cotton rows has a great effect on increasing yield. According to the experiment of Xiaoshan Cotton Farm in Zhejiang Province in 1952, soil hilling increased by 25% compared with no soil hilling. Areas with soil hilling experience should continue to promote this technology this year; areas without soil hilling experience can select key experimental demonstrations this year.

Promote Cotton Plant Pruning Technology

Appropriately implementing cotton plant pruning in combination with the local climate, cultivation technology, and growth conditions in cotton areas can control the growth and development of cotton plants. It is an important cotton planting technical measure. Cotton plant pruning can reduce bud and boll shedding, increase the number of effective bolls, promote early maturity, improve quality, and increase yield per unit area. Because pruning can also advance the maturity period of cotton, it can reduce frost-affected cotton in the north and reduce stiff yellow cotton in the south. Especially in years with a lot of rain and irrigated cotton fields, fertile land or newly rotated cotton fields, pruning is even more necessary to prevent cotton plants from growing excessively. In recent years, pruning technology has been promoted in various cotton areas, but it has not been fully promoted. The current problems in this work are: some cotton farmers in some areas have a habit of "topping" but no habit of pruning. Although farmers in some areas prune cotton plants, the operation is very extensive or not timely. The development of the cooperative movement in cotton areas provides favorable conditions for the promotion of cotton plant pruning technology. In the future, in cotton areas where pruning technology has been accepted by the masses, more detailed pruning techniques should be further promoted according to local specific conditions and cotton plant growth, such as: removing lower branches, topping, removing lateral buds, removing superfluous buds, cutting empty branches, and appropriately removing old leaves. In those cotton areas where pruning technology has no foundation, local farms, agricultural experiment stations, etc. can first do a good job in the experimental demonstration of cotton plant pruning, and gradually promote it in combination with experimental demonstration.

In southern double-cropping cotton areas, there is generally a lot of rain. In order to promote the early maturity of cotton and facilitate the timely sowing of winter crops, cotton plant pruning should also be carried out. In order to solve the problem of seed shortage in the disaster areas of Hubei Province, some S-character cotton varieties were introduced from northern cotton areas this year. In order to prevent this cotton from growing excessively due to excessive rain, the teaching of cotton plant pruning technology must be strengthened in the areas where these cotton seeds are promoted.

Now, the cotton cultivation season has arrived. In order to ensure the victorious completion of the cotton production increase task, the agricultural technology workers in the vast cotton areas should immediately take action, go deep into the countryside, go deep into the masses, carry forward the work style of combining science and technology with the production practice of the masses, rely on mutual aid and cooperation organizations, greatly improve the cotton area technology improvement work, and make the increase in yield per unit area of ​​cotton fields more reliable and guaranteed.

    加强植棉技术工作，争取今年棉花丰收
    农业部副部长　杨显东
    我们国家已进入第一个五年计划的第三年了。过去两年，我国棉花生产由于遭受了严重的自然灾害，都没有达到原定增产指标。因此使我国纺织工业的发展和满足人民生活日益增长的需要受到了一定限制。今年是国家为完成第一个五年建设计划具有决定意义的一年。按照国家的计划，今年要求全国棉花总产量比去年增加四百多万担。这个任务是艰巨的，但也是必须完成的。
    目前农村合作化运动正在迅速发展，国家继续贯彻奖励植棉的政策，普遍实施棉花预购合同制，继续改善棉区粮食供应和棉布统销工作，棉区商品肥料和药械供应也较以往增多，加以几年来我们已积累了不少战胜自然灾害、改良耕作技术的经验，这些都是今年实现棉花增产的有利条件。我国当前增产棉花的途径，除了在宜棉地区适当扩大一部分棉田面积外，主要是靠提高单位面积产量。根据目前棉区耕作情况来看，很多地区（特别是新植棉区）植棉技术仍很粗放；选种、播种、密植、保苗、施肥、防治病虫、中耕培土、整枝等植棉技术，还没有深入而全面地传授和使用。为了保证完成今年棉花增产计划，争取棉花全面丰收，加强植棉技术工作是很必要的。
    作好棉花播种工作
    及时播种，对保证棉株充分生长、提早成熟、减少霜后花、增加产量有显著的效果。几年来许多棉区在这方面已获得一定成绩。今年各棉区墒情一般尚好，这更为及时播种创造了良好条件。因此棉区领导部门应发动棉农及时地在短期内完成播种工作。有些棉区在播种中有拖长播种时期的缺点，今年应当克服。
    结合棉花播种应进一步推广棉花密植。适当密植虽是增产的重要措施之一，但有些地区由于宣传教育不够，群众对它仍有顾虑。对这些对密植尚有顾虑的地区，必须加强宣传教育，多作对比示范等工作。另外根据棉区现在密植情况看，除了少数地区有过密现象以外，一般地区都是密度不够。对这样的地区，应该配合棉田管理，在原有基础上，适当增加株数。今年有些省已准备进一步扩大密植棉田的面积，这是必要的。
    推行保苗技术
    作好保苗工作，消灭棉田缺苗断垄现象，是目前增加棉田产量的重要措施之一。我国一般棉田缺苗率常在百分之十至二十，甚至有高达百分之五十者。如果对这种缺苗现象熟视无睹，认为“七成八成不算缺”，那是错误的。今年许多地区棉种质量不高，因此就必须从加强播种和栽培技术方面来保证全苗。提高棉种质量、推广使用较好播种工具、提高播种技术和防治地下害虫等，都是减少缺苗、保证全苗必不可少的措施，应该受到重视。
    在棉田发生缺苗现象以后，大力推行补苗，也是非常重要的。几年来的经验证明：移栽棉苗的效果很好。一九五四年陕西省泾阳县移苗的棉花比夏收后回种的直播棉花每亩增产百分之五十点五。移栽棉花的方法，不仅可以用于棉田补苗，而且可以在种籽不够或不能适时播种的情况下做为一种种植技术。四川省万县山区农业试验场一九五四年育苗移栽的棉花和直播大田中的棉花的对比试验结果：移栽的较直播的产量提高很多，成熟期提早一个月。移栽的棉花在管理上还较直播的节省劳力。这种育苗移栽的方法虽在少数地区试验成功，但并未普遍推广，棉区农业科学研究、试验部门和国营农场、专县农场可以对这个技术作一些试验和示范。
    增积肥料，改进施肥方法
    由于一九五四年冬季和今年春季农村工作和任务多，有些地区没有注意积肥，因此目前棉区普遍感到肥料缺乏。今年对棉区的商品肥料供应量虽有增加，但仍赶不上生产的需要。因此植棉区的农业生产领导部门仍应抓紧时间发动群众继续积肥。同时还应告诉棉农要合理使用政府优先供应棉区的商品肥料。在肥料不足的情况下，改进施肥方法，经济地使用肥料是很重要的。根据了解，各地在使用肥料方法上，还存在不少问题，撒施肥料（特别是施底粪）的习惯还很普遍，这种施肥方法是很浪费的。据试验，一般改撒施肥料为条施肥料，可增加肥效两倍左右，改为穴施肥料，肥效还可以增加很多。条施或穴施的具体办法是：在棉株行的一侧或两侧开沟或挖穴，沟和穴的深度二至三寸，肥料施入沟或穴内，施后随即盖土。这样施肥即可使棉花植株很快吸收到养分，并且充分发挥了肥料的效能。
    普遍开展防治病虫工作
    棉花病虫害，尤其是某些危害性很大的棉虫（棉蚜、红蜘蛛、盲椿象、叶跳虫、卷叶虫、棉铃虫等）是造成棉花减产的重要因素之一。目前我国已能大量生产药械，也积累了很多治虫的经验。为了适应今后棉区合作化大规模生产的需要，还应该多创造大规模的彻底治虫的经验，过去，有很多干部对彻底防治虫害缺乏信心，再加在领导防治虫害工作中一般号召多，具体领导和督促检查少，严重地影响了棉区防治病虫工作的开展。为了做好今年棉区防治病虫工作，保证棉花增产任务的完成，除了及时地准备充足药械，大力动员棉农积极防治棉花病虫外，对某些危害性很大的棉虫，应采用及时地、连续地防治的办法。比方棉区的棉蚜和红蜘蛛，发生快，蔓延广，对这些害虫更要及时而彻底地防治。防治棉虫要事先做好各项准备工作，并随时侦察虫情，这样才能做到虫害一旦发生，立即组织力量，进行防治。根据过去许多地区的经验，在防治棉虫工作中，可采取层层负责、分区包干的办法。各地领导治虫工作的人员除及时督促检查外，还应帮助解决防治棉虫工作中存在的问题。此外，几年来，棉区的某些农场和农民在防治虫害中，创造和改进了一些效率较高的治虫器械，如：多头式喷雾器、竹筒喷粉器等，各地可根据条件推广运用。同时还应继续注意群众在这方面的创造和改进。
    积极推行棉田中耕培土
    棉田中耕，可疏松土壤、流通空气、提高土温、促进肥料分解、清除杂草和减少水分蒸发。雨后中耕，还可以避免土壤板结。经验证明：在棉株生长期间及时进行多次中耕是必要的。特别是在间苗至现蕾期间，中耕更为必要。今年棉区合作化运动有进一步的发展，在棉区推广的畜力中耕器增多，这些都是增加棉田中耕次数、保证中耕质量的良好条件。
    棉行培土（即壅土）的技术已在部分棉区推行。实践证明：培土后可以促进棉株根部发育、增加肥效、提高产量和适当的抗风、抗涝、抗旱。在台风多的滨海棉区培土抗风更为必要。棉行培土对提高产量的作用很大，据一九五二年浙江省萧山棉场试验，培土的比不培土的增产百分之二十五。已有培土经验的地区，今年应继续推广这一技术；还没有培土经验的地区，今年可选择重点试验示范。
    推广棉株整枝技术
    结合棉区当地气候、栽培技术和生长情况适当地实施棉株整枝，可以控制棉株生长和发育，它是一项重要的植棉技术措施。棉株整枝可以减少落蕾落铃，增加有效铃数，促进早熟，提高品质，增加单位面积产量。由于整枝还能提早棉花成熟期，因此在北方可以减少霜后花，在南方可减少殭黄花。特别是雨多的年份以及灌溉的棉田，肥地或刚换茬的棉田，为了防止棉株徒长，整枝更属必要。几年来，整枝技术已在各棉区推行，但还未全面推广。这件工作中，目前存在的问题是：有些地区的棉农有
  “摘心”习惯而无整枝习惯。有些地区的农民虽进行棉株整枝，但操作很粗放或不及时。棉区合作化运动的开展，给推广棉株整枝技术提供了有利条件。今后在整枝技术已为群众接受的棉区，应根据当地具体条件和棉株生长情况，进一步推行比较细致的整枝技术，如：脱裤腿、打顶、摘旁心、去赘芽、剪空枝、适当去老叶等。在那些整枝技术还无基础的棉区，可以先由当地农场、农业试验站等作好棉株整枝的试验示范，结合试验示范逐步推广。
    南方两熟制棉区一般雨多，为了促进棉花提早成熟，便于冬作及时播种，也应该进行棉株整枝。湖北省的水灾区为了解决缺种问题，今年曾由北方棉区引入一些斯字棉品种。为了防止这种棉花因雨多而徒长，必须在推广这些棉种的地区，加强棉株整枝技术的传授。
    现在，棉花栽培的季节已经到来。为了保证胜利地完成棉花增产任务，广大棉区的农业技术工作同志们应该立即行动起来，深入农村，深入群众，发扬科学技术与群众生产实践相结合的作风，依靠互助合作组织，把棉区技术改进工作，大大提高一步，使棉田单位面积产量的提高更加可靠，更有保证。
