Farmers in fifteen tea-producing provinces, including Zhejiang, Hunan, Anhui, Sichuan, Hubei, Fujian, and Jiangxi, are actively reclaiming barren tea gardens and systematically developing new tea gardens. In 1955, the country will reclaim and newly cultivate more than 610,000 mu of tea gardens.

Zhejiang Province, which accounts for the largest tea production in the country, according to statistics from twenty-two counties, including Taishun, Qingtian, and Shengxian, has restored more than 10,000 mu of barren tea gardens and opened up nearly 5,000 mu of new tea gardens from the end of last winter to this spring. The Meijiawu Tea Production Cooperative, which produces Longjing tea, organized teams for clearing, collecting grass, and tidying up the gardens, and opened up nine mu of new tea gardens in two days. Many tea production cooperatives in Shengxian County have improved planting methods when opening up tea gardens, making the distance and spacing between each row of tea bushes very neat. By mid-March, the Fu'an tea area in Fujian Province had completed more than 58% of its annual tea garden reclamation plan, and newly planted and replanted more than 466,000 tea plants. When planting tea farmers open up tea gardens on sloping mountain land, they dig drainage ditches and build terraced tea gardens to conserve water and soil. Tea farmers in the Anhua tea area of Hunan Province have also reclaimed more than 8,800 mu of new and old tea gardens.

    全国产茶区农民积极开垦茶园
    浙江、湖南、安徽、四川、湖北、福建、江西等十五个产茶省积极垦复荒芜茶园，并有计划地开辟新茶园。在一九五五年，全国将垦复和新辟茶园六十一万多亩。
    茶叶产量占全国第一位的浙江省，根据泰顺、青田、嵊县等二十二个县的统计，从去年冬末到今年春天，已恢复荒芜茶园一万多亩，开辟新茶园近五千亩。出产龙井茶叶的梅家坞茶叶生产合作社，组织了开伐、拾草、整园小队，两天内开辟了九亩新茶园。嵊县很多茶叶生产合作社开辟茶园时改进栽植法，使每行茶蓬的距离和间隔十分整齐。福建省福安茶区到三月中旬，已经完成全年垦辟茶园计划的百分之五十八以上，并新栽和补植四十六万六千多蓬茶树。植茶农民在有坡度的山地垦辟茶园时，开掘排水沟，筑成梯层茶园，使水土得到保持。湖南省安化茶区植茶农民也垦辟新、旧茶园八千八百多亩。
