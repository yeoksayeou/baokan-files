    Sino-Soviet Friendship Forest
    By our reporter Lin Gang
    When visitors arrive in Lushun, as they ride the bus into the city, the first thing they see is the cylindrical, beige building standing on the southern peak of Baiyu Mountain – the Baiyu Pagoda. In the bright spring season, on March 27th and April 10th, the people of Lushun City and the Soviet troops stationed in the Lushunkou area, who are about to withdraw and return home, jointly created the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Forest" on Baiyu Mountain.

    On the morning of the 10th, the small border city had just awakened, and the people planting trees, carrying picks, shovels, saplings, and buckets, came to the foot of Baiyu Mountain from all directions. Three thousand people gathered at the foot of the mountain to hold a memorial meeting. Deputy Mayor Liu Dongsheng said at the meeting: In order to forever commemorate the days we lived together with the Soviet army in Lushunkou, we are planting trees together here today. Let the pine trees we plant make the mountains green, let the apricot and chestnut trees bloom with flowers of friendship and bear the fruits of friendship, and let our friendship develop forever. Soviet military representative Lieutenant Colonel Kharabov also spoke, saying: This forest of friendship will serve as an eternal memento of our ten years of close relationship.

    The mountain was full of people, full of the sound of picks striking the mountain rocks, full of the laughter and singing of labor. Workers, farmers, People's Liberation Army soldiers, students, street residents, government cadres, and Soviet soldiers, Soviet officers, and Soviet family members were mixed into thirty small teams and assigned areas for planting trees. The slogan was: "Plant one, make it live." Someone specially pulled ropes to measure distances, and a Soviet major was responsible for directing the water truck to send water to the mountain. Young worker Sui Faxiang and his neighbors Donia and Soviet army Private Shishak were in one group. The private dug the holes, Sui Faxiang planted the saplings, backfilled the soil, and watered them, and Donia and her nine-year-old daughter Liujia carefully checked each planted sapling, removed every weed from the planting pit, and picked up the rocks. During breaks, celebrations were held everywhere on the hillside: singing, chatting, taking photos, and exchanging souvenirs. The day before, it had just rained, and the soil was loose, so before noon, all 15,000 saplings had been planted.

    Baiyu Mountain is planted with pine and fruit trees. They will grow year by year, and in ten years, this will be a lush and dense forest, symbolizing the eternal and ever-developing friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, passed down through generations, forever green.

    中苏友谊林
    本报记者　林钢
    来到旅顺口的客人，当他乘着公共汽车驶入市区，首先看到的便是矗立在白玉山南巅的一座圆柱形的米色建筑物——白玉塔。在春光明媚的季节，三月二十七日和四月十日两天，旅顺市人民和即将撤离回国的驻旅顺口地区的苏军，在白玉山上共同营造了“中苏友谊林”。
    十日清晨，边疆的这座小城市刚刚醒来，造林的人们，扛着铁镐、铁锨，挟着树苗，提着水桶，从四面八方来到了白玉山麓。三千人聚集在山麓举行了纪念会。刘东升副市长在会上讲话说：为了永远纪念我们和苏军在旅顺口共同生活的日子，我们今天在这里共同植树，让我们栽种的松树使满山翠绿，让杏树和栗树开满友谊之花，结满友谊之果，让我们的友谊永远发展。苏军代表哈拉博夫中校也讲了话。他说：这个友谊的树林，将作为我们亲密相处十年的永恒的留念。
    满山是人，满山一片铁镐碰击山石的橐橐声，满山是劳动的欢笑和歌唱。工人、农民、解放军战士、学生、街道居民、机关干部和苏军战士、苏军军官、苏军家属混合编为三十个小队，划区包干栽树。口号是：“栽一棵、活一棵”。有人专门拉绳量距离，一位苏军少校负责指挥水车向山上送水。青年工人隋法祥和他的邻居冬妮亚、苏军下士什沙克在一个小组。下士刨坑，隋法祥栽树苗、培土、浇水，冬妮亚和她九岁的女儿柳嘉仔细地检查每一棵栽好的树苗，拔除树坑里的每一根杂草，拣去乱石。休息的时候，满山坡到处都在进行联欢活动：唱歌，欢谈，摄影留念，交换纪念品。头一天正巧下过一阵雨，土地松软，所以不到晌午，一万五千株树苗就全部栽种完毕。
    白玉山上栽满了松树和果树。它们将逐年成长，十年以后，这里将是一片蓊郁密茂的丛林，它将象征着中苏两国人民的永恒发展着的友谊，世代流传，万古长青。
