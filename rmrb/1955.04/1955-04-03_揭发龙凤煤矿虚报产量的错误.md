    Exposing the Error of Longfeng Coal Mine's False Reporting of Production
    To the Editor:
    The Longfeng Coal Mine, under the Fushun Mining Bureau, had a period in 1953 when the number of railway cars allocated was insufficient, and the coal washing workshop could not process and transport all of the raw coal, resulting in a large amount of raw coal accumulating on the ground. By the end of 1953, there were over 10,000 tons of raw coal on the ground that had not been processed in a timely manner. In May 1954, with the tacit consent of the Fushun Mining Bureau, the Longfeng Coal Mine actually extracted 2,950 tons from the raw coal that had been accumulating on the ground in the coal washing workshop in 1953, and added it to the raw coal production figures, falsely reporting production; this made it appear that the national raw coal production task assigned to them had been exceeded that month, and falsely reduced production costs by 37,500 yuan accordingly.
    This is an illegal act of falsely reporting achievements and deceiving the state. This is not the first time that the Longfeng Mine has committed similar illegal acts. As early as November 1953, the mine falsely reported raw coal production of 1,940 tons, which was said to have been approved by relevant units of the Mining Bureau.
    The coal mining workshop and the coal washing workshop are two separate systems in terms of production management and cost accounting. The raw coal produced by the coal mining workshop, after acceptance and transportation to the coal washing workshop area, becomes the raw material coal of the coal washing workshop. Although it is also called "raw coal," it is no longer the raw coal of the coal mining workshop. Therefore, the raw material coal that has already been accepted once and had its production performance calculated once cannot be added again to the raw coal production to falsely report the production of raw coal.
    As far as I know, the situation of falsely reporting raw coal production like that of the Longfeng Mine is not an isolated case in the system under the Fushun Mining Bureau, but because the relevant leaders have not paid enough attention to it, it has not been seriously dealt with until now.

    Editor's Note: Comrade Chen Tingzhang reported the erroneous behavior of the Longfeng Coal Mine in falsely reporting achievements to this newspaper as early as November 1954. At that time, the editorial department immediately forwarded this reader's letter to the Fushun Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, asking them to conduct an investigation and inform this newspaper of the results of the investigation. On December 14, 1954, and January 4 of this year, the editorial department received two simple replies from the Mining Department and the Office of the Fushun Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, respectively. The general idea was: "The coal mining workshop and the coal washing workshop of the Longfeng Mine are two continuous production workshops. Due to inaccurate acceptance of raw coal, it is often found that the number of raw coal given by the coal mining workshop to the coal washing workshop is much larger than the number originally accepted by both parties. The two parties often argue about which workshop should be credited for this excess raw coal. Similar situations also exist in other mines. The results of the investigation will be reported in detail later." Why does inaccurate acceptance of raw coal often occur? Why is it unclear which workshop the excess raw coal belongs to? Does this not reflect the chaotic phenomena in the production management of the various mines under the Fushun Mining Bureau? However, the Fushun Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party did not pay enough attention to such a chaotic situation and the Longfeng Coal Mine's act of deceiving the state. This newspaper has repeatedly urged them to deal with it promptly, but they have delayed for more than four months without replying to us with the final outcome.

### 揭发龙凤煤矿虚报产量的错误

专栏：

    揭发龙凤煤矿虚报产量的错误编辑同志：
    抚顺矿务局所属龙凤煤矿，在一九五三年有一段时期因为铁路调拨的车皮不足，选煤车间不能将全部原煤加工外运，造成了大量的落地原煤。到一九五三年年底，落地原煤就有一万多吨，没有得到及时地处理。一九五四年五月，龙凤煤矿在抚顺矿务局的默许下，竟从一九五三年选煤车间的落地原煤中，抽出二千九百五十吨，加在原煤产量内，虚报产量；使这个月超额完成了国家给予的原煤生产任务，使生产成本相应地虚降了三万七千五百元。
    这是一种虚报成绩、欺骗国家的违法行为。龙凤矿类似这样的违法行为已经不止一次了。早在一九五三年十一月，这个矿就虚报了原煤产量一千九百四十吨，据说也是经过矿务局有关单位同意的。
    采煤车间和选煤车间在生产管理和成本计算上，都是两个系统。采煤车间生产出来的原煤经过验收运输到选煤车间范围内，就成了选煤车间的原料煤。它虽然也叫“原煤”，但已不是采煤车间的原煤了。因此，就不能把已经经过一次验收，算过一次生产成绩的落地原料煤，又重新加入原煤产量内来虚报原煤的产量。
    据我了解，在抚顺矿务局所属系统中像龙凤矿虚报原煤产量的情况还不是个别的，但由于有关领导方面没有引起足够的重视，直到现在还没有得到严肃的处理。
        抚顺矿务局龙凤矿财务科副科长　陈庭章
    编者按：读者陈庭章同志在一九五四年十一月就向本报揭发了龙凤煤矿虚报成绩的错误行为，当时，编辑部随即把这件读者来信转给中共抚顺市委会，请他们进行检查并把检查的结果告诉本报。在一九五四年十二月十四日和今年一月四日，编辑部分别收到了中共抚顺市委矿山部和办公室两封简单的回信。大意说：“龙凤矿采煤车间和选煤车间是两个连续生产的车间，由于验收原煤时不准确，常发现采煤车间给选煤车间的数目，比原来双方验收的数目大过很多，对涨出的这部分原煤究竟算那个车间的问题双方常有争论。类似这样的情况，其他矿也同样存在。检查结果待以后详告。”为什么验收原煤常发生不准确的现象？为什么对涨出的原煤弄不清是哪个车间的？这不是反映出了抚顺矿务局所属各矿在生产管理方面的混乱现象吗？但是，中共抚顺市委对于这样的混乱状况和龙凤煤矿欺骗国家的行为，并没有给予足够的重视。本报多次催促他们迅速处理，他们竟拖延了四个多月还没有把最后处理结果答复我们。
