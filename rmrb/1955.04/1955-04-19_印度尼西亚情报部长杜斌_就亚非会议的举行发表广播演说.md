When discussing the imminent opening of the Asian-African Conference, Dubin said that Indonesia, as the host, expresses its pleasure at the trust of the various countries. At the same time, he expressed his welcome and gratitude to the representatives and journalists who have come from afar, as well as those who are concerned about the conference. In addition, allow me to express my deep sorrow and highest respect to the victims of the Chinese delegation who were unable to attend the conference with us due to the plane crash.

Dubin said that it is unprecedented in world history for Asian and African politicians and leaders to gather together to exchange opinions and extensively explore issues. This conference will be conducted in a friendly atmosphere. The conference not only demonstrates the desire of Asian and African nations to participate in politics, breaks down the isolated state that hinders the development of Asian and African nations, opens doors, brings goodwill, but also leads Asian and African nations onto a new path full of hope. The Asian-African Conference is of great significance, it is an international conference representing 1.5 billion people. The conference will make a great contribution to mankind.
