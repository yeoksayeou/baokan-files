"Common experiences and common aspirations constitute the foundation for developing friendly cooperation between China and Indonesia. Friendly cooperation between our two countries is in the interests of both our peoples and in the interests of world peace."

These are the words spoken by Premier Zhou Enlai of our country to the people of Indonesia during his visit to Indonesia. These are the cordial, shared words between friends.

The visit of our country's Premier to our friendly neighbor, the Republic of Indonesia, took place after the victorious conclusion of the historic Asian-African Conference. During the visit, our Premier received a warm welcome and reception from the Indonesian government and people, and held friendly talks with the Indonesian President, Vice President, Prime Minister, and parliamentary leaders. Carrying the shared joy arising from common achievements, this visit by our Premier will further consolidate and develop the friendship between our two countries.

Our two peoples share a traditional friendship with a history of two thousand years. According to Chinese historical records, since the beginning of the second century AD, there have been many exchanges between the peoples of our two countries. In the early fifth century, the Chinese eminent monk Fa Xian visited Java. In the first half of the fifteenth century, Zheng He made seven voyages to the "Western Seas," visiting Indonesia many times. This is a story beloved by the Chinese people. At the same time, the Indonesian classical literature "Hikayat Hang Tuah" also describes many vivid facts about people from Bali and Sumatra visiting China. In modern times, the peoples of both our countries have experienced long struggles against colonial rule. This shared experience has deepened our traditional friendship. Since the establishment of our respective new states, and with the removal of obstacles preventing us from interacting as independent nations, the friendly relations between our two countries have begun to develop anew. The trade agreements and related agreements signed by both parties in November 1953 and September 1954 expanded trade relations between the two countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. In the future, as long as it is not restricted by the U.S. blockade and embargo policy, trade between the two countries will certainly expand further. Our two countries' cultural ties have also increased, and friendly exchanges between the peoples of the two countries are becoming increasingly close.

This relationship between our two countries is based on the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. As everyone knows, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have always been endorsed and supported by the Indonesian government. Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo believes that "the time has come when all countries should coexist independently and begin to build a peaceful world in harmonious cooperation in which every country can live and prosper freely." The joint statement of the two Prime Ministers stated:

"The two Prime Ministers expressed satisfaction with the peaceful coexistence of China and Indonesia as good neighbors on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, and equality and mutual benefit. The two Prime Ministers are convinced that on the basis of these principles, the friendly relations between the two countries will be further developed." The development of friendly cooperation between our two countries will help expand the zone of peace and consolidate peace in Asia and the world.

The recent signing in Bandung of the "Treaty Between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia Concerning the Question of Dual Nationality" is an important symbol of the further development of friendly cooperative relations between our two countries. This difficult problem left over from the old era has been resolved on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in internal affairs. According to this treaty, people with dual nationality will choose one nationality based on the principle of personal voluntarism. Nationals of both countries should respect the laws and social customs of their country of residence and not participate in the political activities of their country of residence. The establishment of these principles is not only conducive to improving the situation of our nationals and strengthening the unity of the peoples of the two countries, but also opens a path for the resolution of the issue of dual nationality internationally. This is another example of resolving international issues based on the Five Principles. The joint statement pointed out: After the treaty is ratified, both countries "will strictly abide by the letter and spirit of the treaty and promote the implementation of the various provisions of the treaty." Obviously, this is unfavorable to the U.S. aggressive bloc, which is trying to provoke relations between our country and our neighboring countries and create antagonism, and very beneficial to those who advocate international cooperation.

The two Prime Ministers also stated in the joint statement: "Maintaining their respective sovereignty and territorial integrity is an inalienable right of the people of any country, and they express deep sympathy and support for the efforts of either of the two countries to maintain their sovereignty and territorial integrity." This is entirely in line with the consistent wishes of the people of our two countries. As everyone knows, the just demands of the Indonesian people to recover West Irian have been ignored by colonial countries. The U.S. government has consistently supported the Dutch occupation, while the Dutch have given the United States guarantees to establish military bases in West Irian. The U.S. occupation of China's Taiwan, interference in China's internal affairs, and war provocations against the Chinese people seriously threaten peace in Asia and the world. This is absolutely intolerable. The Chinese government has indicated its willingness to hold direct negotiations with the U.S. government to ease tensions in the Taiwan area, but the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan is an exercise of their own sovereignty and is China's internal affair, free from foreign interference. The struggle of the Chinese and Indonesian peoples to safeguard their respective national rights and territorial sovereignty is just, and therefore will surely be victorious.

The increase in friendly relations between our country and Indonesia once again proves that Asian and African countries with different systems have a common foundation and can establish and develop peaceful coexistence relations in the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences. Difficult problems caused by external and historical factors between countries can be resolved through consultation on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and friendly cooperation. The peaceful coexistence of Asian and African countries will be a huge contribution to peace in the region and the world.

The Chinese people cherish the friendship between the peoples of the two countries and will continue to work hard to continuously promote friendly cooperation between the two countries. We believe that through the joint efforts of the governments and peoples of the two countries, the development of our friendly cooperative relations has unlimited prospects.

### 中国和印度尼西亚友谊的进一步发展

    中国和印度尼西亚友谊的进一步发展
    “共同的经历和共同的愿望构成了发展中国和印度尼西亚友好合作的基础。我们两国的友好合作是既符合我们两国人民的利益，也符合于世界和平的利益。”
    这是我国周恩来总理在访问印度尼西亚期间向印度尼西亚人民讲的话。这是朋友们之间亲切的、共同的语言。
    我国总理对我们的友好邻邦印度尼西亚共和国进行的访问，是在有历史意义的亚非会议胜利闭幕之后进行的。在访问期间，我国总理受到了印度尼西亚政府和人民热烈的欢迎和接待，同印度尼西亚总统、副总统、总理和议会领袖们举行了友好会谈。带着由于共同的成就而产生的共同的欢欣，我国总理的这次访问，将使我们两国的友谊进一步巩固和发展。
    我们两国人民之间有着二千年历史的传统友谊。据中国史籍所载，从公元二世纪初开始，两国人民就有了许多往来。五世纪初，中国高僧法显到过爪哇。十五世纪前半，郑和七下“西洋”，多次访问了印度尼西亚，这是中国人民所喜爱的故事。同时，印度尼西亚古典文学“杭都亚”英雄传，也描写了峇厘和苏门答腊人来访中国的许多生动事实。近代以来，我们两国人民都经历了反对殖民主义统治的长期斗争。这种共同经历，使我们的传统友谊更加深厚。自从两国建立了各自的新的国家以后，由于打破了阻挠我们以独立国家的资格往来的障碍，我们两国的友好关系开始有了新的发展。一九五三年十一月和一九五四年九月双方签订的贸易协定和有关协定，扩大了两国在平等互利的基础上的贸易关系。今后只要不受美国封锁禁运政策的限制，两国的贸易往来一定会更加扩大。我们两国的文化联系也有了增进，两国人民的友好往来日益密切。
    我们两国的这种关系，是建立在互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的原则上的。大家知道，和平共处五项原则一直就受到印度尼西亚政府的赞同和支持。印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约认为“目前已到了这样的时候，一切国家应该独立共处，并在和谐的合作中开始进行建立每一个国家都能够在里面自由地生活和繁荣的一个和平世界。”两国总理的联合声明说：
  “两国总理对于中国和印度尼西亚两国在互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利的原则的基础上作为良好的邻邦和平相处，表示满意。两国总理深信，在这些原则的基础上，两国间的友好关系将会进一步发展。”我们两国友好合作的发展，将有助于扩大和平地区，巩固亚洲和世界和平。
    最近在万隆签订的“中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国关于双重国籍问题的条约”，是我们两国友好合作关系进一步发展的重要标志。这一旧时代遗留下来的困难问题，是在平等互利和互不干涉内政的原则下求得解决的。根据这个条约，具有双重国籍的人将根据本人自愿的原则选择一种国籍，两国侨民都应尊重侨居国政府的法律和社会习惯，不参加侨居国的政治活动。确立这些原则，不但有利于改善我国侨民的处境，加强两国人民的团结，而且为国际间关于双重国籍问题的解决开了一条道路。这是根据五项原则来解决国际问题的又一范例。联合声明指出：两国“在这个条约得到批准后，将严格遵守条约的文字和精神，促成条约中各项条款的实现”。很显然，这对于竭力挑拨我国同我国邻邦的关系，制造对立的美国侵略集团，是不利的，而对于主张国际合作的人却是非常有利的。
    两国总理在联合声明中还声明：“维护各自的主权和领土完整是任何国家人民的不可剥夺的权利，他们对两国中任何一国维护自己主权和领土完整的努力表示深切的同情和支持。”这是完全符合我们两国人民的一致愿望的。大家知道，印度尼西亚人民收回西伊里安的正义要求，一直受到殖民国家的漠视，美国政府一贯支持荷兰的侵占，而荷兰则给予美国在西伊里安建立军事基地的保证。美国侵占中国台湾，干涉中国内政，并对中国人民实行战争挑衅，严重地威胁到亚洲和全世界的和平。这都是绝对不能容忍的。中国政府已经表明愿意同美国政府举行直接谈判，以缓和台湾地区的紧张局势，但中国人民解放台湾是行使自己的主权，是中国的内政，不受外来干涉。中国人民和印度尼西亚人民维护各自的民族权利和领土主权的斗争，是正义的，因此是一定能够得到胜利的。
    我国和印度尼西亚友好关系的增进，再次证明不同制度的亚非国家之间，有着共同的基础，可以本着求同存异的精神，建立和发展和平共处的关系。各国之间由于外来的和历史的因素所造成的困难问题，可以在平等互利和友好合作的原则上协商解决。亚非国家的和平共处，将是对这一地区和世界和平的巨大贡献。
    中国人民十分珍视两国人民之间的友谊，并将继续努力，不断地促进两国之间的友好合作。我们相信，经过两国政府和人民的共同努力，我们之间的友好合作关系的发展是有无限前途的。
