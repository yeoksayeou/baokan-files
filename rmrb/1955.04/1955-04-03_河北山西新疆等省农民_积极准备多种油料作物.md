    Farmers in Hebei, Shanxi, Xinjiang, and other provinces
    Actively prepare to plant various oil crops
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Hebei, Shanxi, Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, and other provinces are actively preparing to expand the planting area of oil crops.
    Hebei Province is one of the major oil crop producing areas in the country. In 1955, the province initially plans to sow 7.15 million mu of various oil crops, an increase of more than 580,000 mu compared with 1954. Among them, the peanut planting area will increase from 4.15 million mu in 1954 to 4.57 million mu. It is estimated that the total output of oil crops will increase by more than 200 million jin compared with 1954. At present, farmers across the province have prepared more than 80 million jin of various oil crop seeds, and the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry is also transferring 40 million jin of peanut seeds to supply farmers. Most of the peanut rhizobium inoculant, enough for sowing 700,000 mu of peanuts, has been rushed out by state-owned farms in Tongxian Special District and is now being transported to Handan, Shijiazhuang, Baoding and other special districts that planted peanuts earlier.
    This year, Shanxi Province will sow 2,727,000 mu of oil crops such as peanuts, hemp, and sunflowers, an increase of 13.4 percent over 1954, and the total output is expected to increase by 20.6 percent over 1954. At present, many agricultural production cooperatives in various places are leading mutual aid teams and individual farmers to formulate planting plans and start sowing. Five agricultural production cooperatives in Zhouchen Township, Xia County, dispatch more than 100 members every day to plant hemp and sunflowers on idle land such as nearby beaches, riverbanks, and field edges, planting 97 mu within three days. In order to help farmers solve the difficulties in seeds and technology, five special districts including Changzhi and Yanbei are transferring more than 2 million jin of sunflower seeds from reserves to farmers. Staff from agricultural technology extension stations in Changzhi, Yuci, and other places have generally gone deep into rural areas to help farmers improve sowing techniques. Farmers in areas of the province that do not produce oil crops are also actively responding to the state's call to expand the planting area of oil crops, and have universally launched the activity of "planting one fen of oil crops per person." It is estimated that these areas can increase the planting of oil crops by a total of 370,000 mu, and the increased oil production can reach more than 24 million jin. In this way, the edible oil needed by each farm household can basically be completely self-sufficient.
    This year, Xinjiang Province plans to expand the planting area of oil crops by 280,000 mu, and the total planting area of oil crops will reach 1.74 million mu. The planned yield per mu will be increased by more than 7 percent compared with last year, and the total output will increase by 27.79 percent. In order to ensure the completion of this plan, in addition to determining Baicheng as a key demonstration county for cultivating oil crops, the relevant departments have also decided to use state-owned farms and agricultural experiment stations in Tacheng, Yili, Baicheng, Shache, and Changji, which have better oil crop production, as the base points for conducting oil crop cultivation experiments and fine variety comparison demonstrations. In addition, 23 technology extension stations, agricultural experiment stations, special districts, or county farms are responsible for providing technical guidance for oil production and helping farmers increase oil crop yields. At present, agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups in many areas have summarized the experience of planting oil crops in 1954, revised this year's oil increase plan, and are actively selecting seeds, exchanging seeds, accumulating fertilizers, planning land, and studying cultivation techniques.
    Heilongjiang Province has decided to mobilize the elderly, women, children, and employees of organizations and schools in rural areas during spring plowing to use idle land such as field edges, corners, and housesides to plant half a fen of oil crops per person. In this way, the province can increase the oil crop area by 30,000 to 40,000 hectares in addition to completing the state-required oil crop planting plan. Recently, many middle school students and primary school students in Baiquan, Keshan, Suihua, and other places proposed to students across the province to use idle land to plant sunflowers and castor beans and other oil crops. Students of Baiquan Junior High School said in a letter to the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Provincial Student Federation: "We have summarized the experience of planting oil crops in 1954, and now the biology teacher is guiding us to study and improve cultivation techniques. We must insist on using idle land to plant oil crops in our extracurricular activities." They hope that middle school students across the province can do the same. The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Provincial Student Federation replied, expressing their approval of their suggestion.

### 河北山西新疆等省农民  积极准备多种油料作物

    河北山西新疆等省农民
    积极准备多种油料作物
    本报讯　河北、山西、新疆、黑龙江等省积极准备扩大油料作物种植面积。
    河北省是全国主要油料作物产区之一。一九五五年这个省初步计划播种各种油料作物七百一十五万亩，比一九五四年扩大五十八万多亩，其中花生播种面积将由一九五四年的四百一十五万亩增加到四百五十七万亩。预计油料作物的总产量将比一九五四年增加二亿多斤。现在全省农民已准备好各种油料作物种籽八千多万斤，省农林厅也正调运四千万斤花生种籽供应农民。足够播种七十万亩花生用的花生根瘤菌拌种剂，大部分已由通县专区国营农场赶制出来，现正运往邯郸、石家庄和保定等种花生较早的专区。
    山西省今年播种花生、大麻、向日葵等油料作物的面积将有二百七十二万七千亩，比一九五四年增加百分之十三点四，总产量预计比一九五四年增加百分之二十点六。现在各地许多农业生产合作社正带动互助组和个体农民制定种植计划，并开始播种。夏县周陈乡的五个农业生产合作社每天出动一百多个社员，在附近的沙滩、河边和耕地边沿等空闲土地上，点种大麻、向日葵，三天内就点种了九十七亩。为了帮助农民解决种籽和技术上的困难，长治、雁北等五个专区正把储备的二百多万斤向日葵种籽调剂给农民。长治、榆次等地的农业技术推广站的工作人员，普遍深入农村帮助农民改进播种技术。省内不是产油料作物地区的农民，也积极响应国家扩大油料作物种植面积的号召，普遍展开了“每人种一分地油料作物”的活动。预计这些地区总共可增种油料作物三十七万亩，增产的油料能达到二千四百多万斤。这样每户农家需用的食油，基本上可以全部自给。
    新疆省今年计划扩大油料作物播种面积二十八万亩，油料作物总播种面积将达到一百七十四万亩。每亩单位面积产量计划比去年提高百分之七以上，总产量将增加百分之二十七点七九。为了保证完成这个计划，有关部门除确定拜城为栽培油料作物的重点示范县外，还决定以油料作物生产较好的塔城、伊犁、拜城、莎车和昌吉等地方国营农场和农业试验站为基点，进行油料作物的栽培试验和良种对比示范等工作。此外，还有二十三个技术推广站、农业试验站、专区或县农场，负责进行油料生产技术指导工作，帮助农民提高油料作物产量。现在许多地区的农业生产合作社和互助组已经总结了一九五四年种植油料作物的经验，修订了今年的油料增产计划，并在积极选种，换种，积攒肥料，规划土地和钻研栽培技术。
    黑龙江省决定在春耕中发动农村中的老年人、妇女、儿童及机关团体的职工和学校的学生，利用地边、地角、宅旁等空闲地，每人种植半分地的油料作物。这样，全省就可在完成国家要求的油料作物播种计划以外，增加油料作物面积三万到四万公顷。最近，拜泉、克山、绥化等地的许多中学生和小学生向全省学生提议利用空闲地种植向日葵和蓖麻等油料作物。拜泉初级中学学生在写给青年团黑龙江省委员会和省学生联合会的信中说：“我们总结了一九五四年种植油料作物的经验，现在生物老师又指导我们研究和改进栽培技术，我们要坚持在课余活动中，利用空闲地种植油料作物。”他们希望全省的中学学生都能这样做。青年团黑龙江省委会和省学生联合会回信表示赞同他们的建议。
