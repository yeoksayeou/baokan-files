    New Transportation Methods
    In the past month, Anshan Iron and Steel Company and Lingshan Railway Station have adopted the transportation method of "grouping direct trains," which has doubled the transportation speed. In the past, each train of goods shipped from Anshan to Tianjin took five days due to long stop times en route. Now, it only takes two days to go directly to Tianjin. Similarly, the transportation time between Anshan and Hankou, Shanghai, and other places has also been shortened by nearly half. After adopting this new transportation method, production units and construction units across the country can obtain various steel and chemical products more quickly.
      The "grouping direct trains" transportation method was jointly researched and adopted by Lingshan Railway Station and the sales department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company after studying advanced Soviet experience. According to this method, they draw up transportation plans every day, concentrating the goods from Anshan Iron and Steel's twenty-two directly shipping factories and warehouses according to different regions' orders, and group them together for loading. The transportation section of Anshan Iron and Steel's sales department uses the telephone every hour to direct the twenty-two units to load goods for the same destination at the same time. In this way, after the trains arrive at stations such as Lingshan and Sujiatun, they do not need to be regrouped and can travel directly to the delivery location. In the past, due to decentralized loading, each train contained goods arriving in various different regions, and had to undergo many regroupings and reorganizations at intermediate stations. For example, goods shipped from Anshan to Tianjin had to go through five or six regroupings. Now, goods shipped from Anshan to Tianjin use direct trains.
    The new transportation method also solves the problem of vehicle congestion in the past, and the turnover rate of train cars has been accelerated. At Lingshan Railway Station, the front gate of Anshan Iron and Steel, the implementation of the new transportation method saved more than 160 train cars in March alone. (Xinhua News Agency)

    新的运输方法
    在最近一个月里，鞍山钢铁公司和灵山车站采用了“编组直达列车”的运输方法，运输的速度加快了一倍左右。过去，从鞍山运往天津的每列车货物，因为途中停车时间很长，需要五天，现在直达天津只需两天了。同样鞍山和汉口、上海等地的运输时间也缩短了将近一半。这一新的运输方法采用后，全国各生产单位和建设单位就可以更快的得到各种钢铁和化学产品。
      “编组直达列车”的运输方法，是灵山火车站和鞍山钢铁公司推销处在学习了苏联先进经验后，共同研究采用的。按照这一方法，他们每天排出运输计划，把鞍钢二十二个直接发货的工厂和仓库的货物，按照不同地区的订货集中起来编组装车。鞍钢推销处代运科每小时用电话指挥着二十二个单位在同一时间内，装上同一订货地点的货物。这样，列车开到灵山、苏家屯等车站后，就不用重新编组，可以用直达列车开到收货地点了。过去因为分散装货，每一列车里混杂了到达各个不同地区的货物，在中途车站要经过许多次编组整理。例如鞍山运往天津的货物，中途就要经过五、六次编组、现在从鞍山运到天津的货物就用直达列车了。
    新的运输方法还解决了过去车辆堵塞的问题，火车皮的运转速度加快了。仅鞍钢的前门——灵山车站，因为实行新的运输方法，三月份就节省了一百六十多个车皮。（新华社）
