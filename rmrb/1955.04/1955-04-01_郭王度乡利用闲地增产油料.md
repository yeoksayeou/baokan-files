    Guo Wangdu Township Utilizes Idle Land to Increase Oilseed Production
    Farmers in Guo Wangdu Township, Anyang County, Henan Province, responding to the state's call to increase oilseed crop production, recently identified 364 mu of idle land of various sizes in five villages throughout the township. The First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Danian Village had more than one mu of graveyard land, which was previously uncultivated, overgrown with weeds, and a breeding ground for pests, harming crops. Now, the cooperative has decided to plant sunflowers and hemp in the spaces between the graves. The entire village has also identified 136 mu of idle land along roadsides, well platforms, and garden edges. To solve the seed shortage, in addition to ordering some from the supply and marketing cooperative, the agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams throughout the township have made adjustments among themselves. The First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Danian Village has 150 jin of sunflower seeds and 40 jin of hemp seeds, and after sowing within the cooperative, it has a surplus to be transferred to cooperatives outside the village. Currently, more than 100 mu of idle land in the township has been planted with hemp, and the rest is being prepared for planting sunflowers.

    郭王度乡利用闲地增产油料
    河南安阳县郭王度乡农民，响应国家增产油料作物的号召，最近在全乡五个村共查出闲地大小地块三百六十四亩。大碾屯第一农业生产合作社有一亩多坟地，过去不种庄稼，野草丛生，是产生虫灾的窝穴，危害庄稼。现社里决定在坟隙种上向日葵和大麻子。全村又查出路边、井台、园地边等闲地共一百三十六亩。为了解决缺种问题，除已向供销社订购一部外，全乡各农业生产合作社和互助组又互相作了调剂，大碾屯第一农业生产合作社有一百五十斤向日葵种籽和四十斤大麻子种籽，除社内播种外，还余一部分种籽调剂到了社外，目前全乡已有一百多亩闲地都种上了大麻子，其余正准备种向日葵。
