　　The Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Soviet of the Union, M.A. Suslov, said that the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities agreed with this agreement and recommended that the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR approve it.

　　After discussing Molotov's report and the recommendations from the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities, the Presidium approved the agreement concerning the resolution of border and financial matters, signed in Tehran on December 2, 1954, between the Soviet Union and Iran, which had been approved by the Council of Ministers of the USSR and agreed to by the Foreign Affairs Committees of both chambers.

　　Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: According to TASS, Moscow: The Foreign Affairs Committees of the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR held joint sessions in the Kremlin on the 25th to discuss the proposal submitted by the Council of Ministers of the USSR to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR for examination regarding the abolition of the "Treaty of Alliance in the War against Hitlerite Germany and its Associates in Europe and Post-War Cooperation and Mutual Assistance concluded between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland". The meeting was chaired by D.T. Shepilov, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Soviet of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

　　First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR, V.V. Kuznetsov, delivered a report on the abolition of the aforementioned treaty.

　　During the discussion of this report, M.I. Kuchava, Shelepin, Mitin, members of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Soviet of Nationalities, and I.G. Kebin, Sniečkus, members of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Soviet of the Union, and many others spoke. Finally, Chairman Shepilov spoke, pointing out that all the representatives who spoke unanimously supported the proposal put forward by the Council of Ministers of the USSR regarding the abolition of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, on the grounds that the British government had abandoned the obligations it undertook under this treaty, supported the revival of German militarism, and concluded an aggressive alliance with re-arming West Germany, which greatly deepened the threat of a new war breaking out. Shepilov pointed out that the British government's act of writing off the Anglo-Soviet Treaty could not but leave a mark on Anglo-Soviet relations. However, the Soviet Union will continue to consistently implement a policy of striving for peace and for easing international tensions.

　　The Foreign Affairs Committees of the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR approved the proposal of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and decided to recommend that the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR abolish the Anglo-Soviet Treaty concluded in 1942.

    苏联最高苏维埃主席团批准苏联伊朗协定
    两院外委会联席会议建议废除英苏条约
    新华社二十六日讯　塔斯社莫斯科二十五日讯：苏联最高苏维埃主席团四月二十五日审查了苏联部长会议提请批准苏联和伊朗一九五四年十二月二日在德黑兰签订的关于解决边界和财政问题的协定的建议。
    苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫在苏联最高苏维埃主席团会议上作了关于这一协定的报告。
    联盟院外交委员会主席米·安·苏斯洛夫说，联盟院和民族院的外交委员会同意这一协定，并且建议苏联最高苏维埃主席团批准这一协定。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团在讨论莫洛托夫的报告以及联盟院和民族院的外交委员会的建议以后，批准了经过苏联部长会议批准和两院的外交委员会同意的、苏联和伊朗一九五四年十二月二日在德黑兰签订的关于解决边界和财政问题的协定。
    新华社二十六日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院的外交委员会二十五日在克里姆林宫举行联席会议，讨论苏联部长会议提交苏联最高苏维埃主席团审查的关于废除“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和大不列颠及北爱尔兰联合王国缔结的战时反对希特勒德国及其欧洲与国与战后合作互助同盟条约”的建议。会议由苏联最高苏维埃民族院外交委员会主席德·特·谢皮洛夫担任主席。
    苏联外交部第一副部长瓦·瓦·库兹涅佐夫作了关于废除上述条约的报告。
    在讨论这个报告时，民族院外交委员会委员麦·伊·库查瓦、谢列平、米丁和联盟院外交委员会委员伊·格·凯宾、斯涅奇库斯等许多人都发了言。最后，主席谢皮洛夫发言指出：所有发言的代表都一致支持苏联部长会议提出的关于废除英苏条约的建议，理由是：英国政府抛弃了它根据这个条约而承担的义务，支持复活德国军国主义，并且同正在重新武装的西德缔结侵略性的同盟，这样就大大加深了新战争爆发的威胁。谢皮洛夫指出：英国政府那种一笔勾销英苏条约的行为不能不在英苏关系上留下烙印。但是苏联今后还要贯彻始终地执行为和平以及为缓和国际紧张局势而奋斗的政策。
    苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院的外交委员会批准了苏联部长会议的建议，并且决定建议苏联最高苏维埃主席团废除一九四二年缔结的英苏条约。
