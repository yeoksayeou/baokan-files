What the Shortcomings of the Changjiang Daily's Report on the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Show
Shi Rong

Not long ago, the responsible comrades of the Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau convened a symposium of journalists, where they put forward opinions on the shortcomings of various newspapers, news agencies, and radio stations in reporting on the preparatory work of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. The Wuhan Changjiang Daily conducted a preliminary inspection based on this. The inspection shows that the residual influence of bourgeois journalistic viewpoints not only still exists in some Party newspaper workers, but is also quite serious. This is something that deserves our vigilance.

The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is a great bridge construction project in the country's socialist construction cause. The completion of this bridge will have a significant impact on China's transportation construction and even the entire economic construction. The construction of this bridge is also an extremely arduous and complex project; even some of its preparatory steps, such as the construction of the Hanshui Railway Bridge, the Hanshui Highway Bridge, and other projects, are also quite arduous and complex. The Changjiang Daily attached importance to this construction and conducted relatively focused and systematic reports, which played a certain role in mobilizing the masses to actively participate in socialist construction, inspiring the enthusiasm of the builders of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, and promoting work in various aspects. However, many of these reports lacked ideological depth, contained exaggerations and inaccuracies, violated the principle of truthfulness in news reporting, and caused adverse political effects.

The main shortcoming of the Changjiang Daily in reporting on the bridge project lies in the one-sided reporting and emphasis on the smooth progress and victorious completion of the construction project, while rarely revealing the arduousness, complexity, and difficulties and shortcomings in the progress of the project. Therefore, the overall impression given is that one victory follows another, and the victories are easily achieved, without seeing the essence of the development process. In fact, to build such a great bridge, there are many difficulties, especially since many bridge projects involve underwater operations. Drilling, design, and especially construction have special difficulties compared to general basic construction projects. Our victory was precisely achieved by overcoming various difficulties. The newspaper should not shy away from these difficulties but should reveal the difficulties in construction and the shortcomings in the work in a down-to-earth manner to arouse everyone's vigilance and mobilize everyone's strength to overcome difficulties and shortcomings. The newspaper should also deeply reflect the process of overcoming difficulties and shortcomings so as to enhance the confidence of the working class and the people in building socialism under the leadership of the Communist Party. Neglecting this important aspect in the reporting will inevitably create a misconception among the people that the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge is easy and smooth. This will not only encourage complacency among the builders but also affect the active support of all parties for the project. This is very unfavorable to our construction cause.

Closely related to the above shortcomings is the serious exaggeration and misrepresentation in some publicity reports. These reports distorted the true face of things and tried to describe them as beautifully as possible. For example, Hanyang Station is just an ordinary station, not far from the Hanyang Sleeper Anti-corrosion Plant, etc., but the newspaper described it as a "newest-style station," "with a very long switch line extending to the sleeper anti-corrosion plant in the future..." The Renshou Road overpass on the railway line from Hankou to Hanyang is a very ordinary overpass, but the newspaper said: "The form of the Renshou Road overpass is still rare in our country." In order to promote the characteristics of the Hanshui Highway Bridge as an urban bridge, the newspaper published the highway bridge's art design drawings, which had not yet been finally approved. According to this design, two pagodas with national forms would stand at each end of the bridge, requiring construction and beautification costs of more than 400,000 yuan, some of which violated the principle of thrift and were unnecessary waste in the current bridge construction (according to the now revised art design, the cost has been reduced). Only some of the offices in the Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau's office building were designed with heating equipment, and only the dispatching room could barely be said to have soundproofing devices, but the newspaper said: "The offices inside the building are spacious and bright, with heating and cooling equipment and soundproofing devices." This kind of exaggeration and misrepresentation developed in many aspects. Even the Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau simply ran a children's school, and the newspaper spent a lot of ink to exaggerate it, saying that it "faces Lotus Lake, backs on Tortoise Hill, and is surrounded by houses and buildings on both sides, embracing the entire school. The natural conditions are extremely beautiful..." There were quite a few similar examples in the 1954 reports. On January 1st and 2nd of this year, the fact that a train that was not officially opened to traffic was driven to Hanyang was inaccurately reported as the "opening to traffic" of the Hanshui Railway Bridge, and an editorial was published. The Changjiang Daily reporter himself was clearly standing on a tarpaulin-covered wagon (with three other freight cars), but he also wrote this tarpaulin-covered wagon as a "passenger car." All these exaggerated and inaccurate reports resulted in passivity in the work, causing undue losses to the work; at the same time, they seriously damaged the credibility of the Party newspaper. Some workers said: "Reporters are really capable. They have everything they want!" This is an extremely sharp criticism of the newspaper.

What do these examples show? They show that some of our Party newspaper workers lack a complete understanding of the laws of economic construction and a comprehensive understanding of the Party's policies. The socialist construction we are carrying out, especially the key construction projects, are large in scale, technically complex, and require high standards. However, we lack knowledge and experience. Therefore, the construction process is a serious struggle process, which includes various struggles against difficulties, shortcomings, and errors. If the news reports fail to show how the Party and the working class overcome various difficulties and obstacles, then they distort the essence of the development of things. Secondly, the Party's requirements for basic construction projects are good quality, low cost, fast progress, and implementation of the labor protection policy. Especially for bridge projects, the requirements for quality and safety are even higher. If the newspaper does not pay attention to and fully reflect these characteristics, but only focuses on the progress in isolation, one-sidedly reflecting the progress of the project, and even promotes waste as a good thing, then it cannot comprehensively reflect the implementation of the Party's policy. The more such publicity reports are made, the greater the adverse effects will be.

These examples also show that some of our Party newspaper workers lack a serious sense of responsibility and a down-to-earth work style in dealing with news reports. On the contrary, they have a serious subjective style of thinking. The characteristic is that they do not proceed from the facts, but from subjective wishes. Therefore, they only saw the great and important side of the construction project, while neglecting the arduous and complex side; they only emphasized that the newspaper must "reflect every achievement of national construction," without at the same time emphasizing that it must reflect "how the builders overcome difficulties to obtain these achievements." Under the guidance of such one-sided thinking, the result will inevitably develop into replacing policies with feelings and replacing facts with wishes. Instead of deeply studying policies, conscientiously investigating and researching, and grasping essential and typical subjects to organize reports, they only rely on subjective wishes to pursue sensational things such as "best," "first," and "most advanced." But what is the objective reality? As the responsible comrades of the Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau said: "Our work is just so ordinary. Not every thing is very novel. It is these ordinary things that constitute the main part of our construction work. In fact, even so-called novel things have their own conditions for their production. Without these conditions, the so-called advanced is not advanced." Indeed, the cause we are engaged in is the extremely great cause of socialist construction. However, this cause is the result of the ordinary labor created by the thousands of working people under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government. If we do not look at problems in depth, but only pursue novelty and sensationalism, then it will inevitably develop into the errors of fabricating, making up, boasting, exaggerating, and "elevating" facts.

News must be completely true. This is one of the basic principles that our Party's newspapers must follow. What we publicize is the truth, and this is the fundamental reason why the Party's newspapers are powerful. Comrade Mao Zedong once taught us: "The proletariat has only one sharpest and most effective weapon, and that is a serious, combative, scientific attitude. The Communist Party does not rely on intimidation to make a living, but on the truth of Marxism-Leninism, on seeking truth from facts, and on science." ("Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing") The shortcomings of one-sidedness and exaggeration in the publicity reports of the Changjiang Daily on the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge violated the principle of truthfulness in news. The reason for this shortcoming, in addition to the fact that the newspaper staff have not studied the theory of economic construction and the Party's policies enough, is mainly the result of the trouble caused by the subjective style of thinking. This subjectivism is a concrete manifestation of the influence of bourgeois idealism on the Party's newspaper workers, and its harm is very great. As Comrade Mao Zedong taught us, this anti-scientific, anti-Marxist-Leninist subjectivism should be regarded as a manifestation of impurity of Party spirit, and it must be overthrown as a great enemy of the Communist Party. The Changjiang Daily and other relevant news units and staff should deeply accept this lesson, fully recognize the harm of this bourgeois idealist thinking to the Party's cause and the cause of the Party's newspaper, strengthen the exercise of Party spirit, strengthen the study of materialism, improve the level of policy thinking, and establish a down-to-earth, in-depth investigation and research style of thinking, and strive to adhere to the truthfulness of news reporting.

### 长江日报关于武汉长江大桥报道的缺点说明了什么

    长江日报关于武汉长江大桥报道的缺点说明了什么
    石容
    不久以前，武汉大桥工程局负责同志召集了一个记者座谈会，会上对各有关报社、通讯社、广播电台在报道武汉长江大桥准备工程中的缺点提出了意见。武汉长江日报据此进行了初步检查。通过检查可以看出：资产阶级新闻观点的残余影响在某些党报工作人员中，不仅仍然存在，而且还相当严重，这是值得我们警惕的。
    武汉长江大桥，是国家社会主义建设事业中一项伟大的桥梁建设。这座桥的建成，将对我国交通建设乃至整个经济建设产生重要作用。这座桥的建设，又是一个极其艰巨复杂的工程；就是它的一些准备步骤如修建汉水铁桥、汉水公路桥以及其他工程，也是相当艰巨复杂的。长江日报重视这一建设，进行了比较集中的、系统的报道，这对于动员人民群众积极参加社会主义建设，鼓舞武汉长江大桥建设者的热情，推动各方面的工作，都起了一定的作用。但其中不少报道思想性不强，内容有夸大失实的地方，违反了新闻报道的真实性的原则，并造成了恶劣的政治影响。
    长江日报在报道大桥工程中的主要缺点，在于片面地报道和强调了建设工程的顺利进行和胜利完成的情况，而对于工程的艰巨性、复杂性和工程进展中的困难和缺点，却很少揭示出来。因此总起来给人的印象就是：一个胜利紧接着一个胜利，胜利的得来很是容易，看不出事物发展过程的实质。事实上，要建设这样一座伟大的桥梁，困难是很多的，特别是桥梁工程许多是水下作业，在钻探、设计特别是施工中，比起一般的基本建设工程更有其特殊的困难。我们的胜利正是克服了各种困难才取得的。报纸不应该讳言这些困难，而应该实事求是地揭示建设中的困难以及工作中的缺点，以引起大家的警惕，动员大家的力量来战胜困难和克服缺点。报纸还应该深刻地反映出战胜困难和克服缺点的过程，这样才能提高工人阶级和人民群众在共产党领导下建设社会主义的信心。在报道中忽略了这一重要方面，就必然会在人民群众中造成一种错觉，以为长江大桥的建设是轻而易举，一帆风顺的。这就不仅会助长建设者的麻痹自满情绪，而且会影响各方面对工程的积极支援。这对于我们的建设事业是很不利的。
    和上述缺点密切相连的，就是有些宣传报道有严重的夸大失实现象。这些报道歪曲了事物的真实面貌，把它们尽量地说得美好。例如汉阳车站只是
  一个普通车站，它离汉阳枕木防腐厂等不远，却被报纸说成是一个“最新式车站”，“将来并有很长的岔线伸展到枕木防腐厂……”。从汉口到汉阳铁路线上的仁寿路跨线桥，是一座很普通的跨线桥，报纸却说：“仁寿路跨线桥的形式在我国还是不多见的”。为了要宣传汉水公路桥作为城市桥梁的特点，报纸就把尚未经最后批准的公路桥美术设计图刊载出来，按照这个设计，桥的两头各耸立具有民族形式的两个宝塔，所需建筑费和美化费用约四十多万元，其中一部分违反了节约原则，是当前建桥中不应有的浪费（按现已修正美术设计，削减费用）。武汉大桥工程局的办公大楼，只有部分办公室设计有暖气设备，只有调度室才勉强可说是有隔音装置，报纸却说：“大楼里面的办公室，宽敞明亮，室内并有冷暖设置和隔音装置。”这种夸大失实发展到了许多方面，甚至武汉大桥工程局因陋就简地办了一所子弟学校，报纸也费了许多笔墨加以渲染，说它“面临莲花湖，背依龟山，两侧都是修建的住宅和楼房，把整个学校环抱其中，自然条件极优美……”。类似的事例在一九五四年的报道中还不少。今年一月一日、二日又把一列并非正式通车的火车开到汉阳的事实不确切地报道成为汉水铁桥“通车”，并发表了社论。长江日报记者自己明明站在一个篷车上（另有三个货车），却把这个篷车也写成“客车”。所有这些夸张失实的报道，其结果是造成工作中的被动，使工作遭受不应有的损失；同时也严重地损害了党报的威信。有些工人说：“到底记者本领大，要啥有啥！”这正是对报纸的一种极其尖锐的批评。
    这些事例说明了什么？它们说明了我们有些党报工作人员对经济建设的规律缺乏完整的认识，对党的政策缺乏全面的理解。我们进行的社会主义建设事业，特别是其中的重点建设工程，规模巨大，技术复杂，要求很高，而我们又缺乏知识，缺乏经验，因此，建设的过程就是一个严重的斗争过程，它包括着对困难以及缺点和错误进行的各种斗争。如果在新闻报道上对于党和工人阶级如何克服各种困难和障碍表现无力，那就歪曲了事物发展的本质。其次，党对基本建设工程的要求，是质量好、费用省、进度快、并贯彻劳动保护的方针，特别是桥梁工程，对于质量、安全要求更高。报纸不注意和充分反映这些特点，而只是孤立地抓住进度，片面反映工程进度，甚至把浪费现象也当作好的东西加以宣扬，这就不能全面地反映党的政策的贯彻，这样的宣传报道越多，所产生的不良效果也就越大。
    这些事例还说明了，我们有些党报工作人员，对待新闻报道还缺乏严肃的责任感和实事求是的工作作风。相反地，却有着严重的主观主义的思想作风。其特点就是不是从事实出发，而是从主观愿望出发。因此，他们就只看到了建设工程的伟大、重要的一面，而疏忽了艰苦、复杂的一面；就只强调了报纸必须“反映国家建设的每一成就”，而没有同时强调必须反映建设者“如何克服困难才获得这些成就”。在这样片面思想的指导下，其结果必然发展到以感想代替政策，用愿望代替事实，不是深入地钻研政策，认真地调查研究，抓住本质的具有典型意义的题材组织报道，而是仅凭主观愿望，追求“最好”、“第一”、“最先进”等耸人听闻的东西。而客观实际又是怎样呢？正如武汉大桥工程局负责同志所说：“我们的工作就是这样平平常常，并不是每一件事情都是非常新奇的，正是这些平常事情构成了我们建设工作的主要部分。其实，就拿所谓新奇事情来说吧，也还是有它自己的产生条件的，离开了这些条件，所谓先进也就不先进了。”的确，我们从事的事业，是极其伟大的社会主义建设事业，但是这个事业，却是在党和人民政府的领导下千千万万劳动人民平凡的劳动创造的结果。如果不深入本质来看待问题，而只是去追求新奇，追求耸人听闻，那就必然会发展到虚构、捏造、吹嘘、夸大和把事实“提高一步”的错误。
    新闻必须完全真实，这是我们党的报刊必须遵循的基本原则之一。我们宣传的都是真理，这就是党的报刊之所以有力量的根本原因。毛泽东同志曾经教导我们：“无产阶级的最尖锐最有效的武器只有一个，那就是严肃的战斗的科学态度。共产党不靠吓人吃饭，而是靠马克思列宁主义的真理吃饭，靠实事求是吃饭，靠科学吃饭。”（“反对党八股”）长江日报关于武汉长江大桥的宣传报道所存在的片面性和夸大失实的缺点，却违背了新闻真实性的原则。造成这种缺点的原因，除报纸工作人员对经济建设的理论和党的政策学习不够外，最主要的是主观主义思想作风的作祟。这种主观主义正是资产阶级唯心主义思想对党报工作人员的影响的具体表现，它的危害性是很大的。正如毛泽东同志所教导我们的一样，应当把这种反科学的反马克思列宁主义的主观主义看作党性不纯的表现，要把它当作共产党的大敌来打倒。长江日报及其他有关新闻单位和工作人员，都应该深刻接受这一教训，充分认识这种资产阶级唯心主义思想对党的事业和党报事业的危害性，加强党性锻炼，加强唯物主义的学习，提高政策思想水平，树立实事求是、深入调查研究的思想作风，为坚持新闻报道的真实性而斗争。
