Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 10th. The influence of the German Communist Party among the working masses in West Germany is constantly growing. More and more West German working people are applying to join the Communist Party, regardless of the persecution by the Bonn authorities. According to the German News Agency, in North Rhine-Westphalia alone, 3,560 people have joined the German Communist Party in recent weeks. In one locality, 57 people applied to join the party in a single day.

The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, Max Reimann, pointed out in a recent article that the campaign to commemorate Thälmann by recruiting new members has achieved remarkable results. In 1954 alone, about 6,000 advanced workers in West Germany joined the Communist Party; the German Communist Party's official newspaper, "Freies Volk," and other party newspapers and periodicals gained a total of 50,000 new subscribers.

    德共纪念台尔曼征收新党员运动成绩显著
    新华社柏林十日电　德国共产党在西德劳动群众中的影响不断增长。越来越多的西德劳动人民不顾波恩当局的迫害，申请加入共产党。据德意志通讯社报道，仅在北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州一州，最近几个星期中就有三千五百六十人加入了德国共产党，有一个地方，一天之内就有五十七人申请入党。
    德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼在最近发表的文章中指出，纪念台尔曼征收新党员运动已经获得显著成绩。在一九五四年一年中，约有六千名西德先进工人参加了共产党；德国共产党机关报“自由人民报”和其他党报、党刊一共增加了五万个订户。
