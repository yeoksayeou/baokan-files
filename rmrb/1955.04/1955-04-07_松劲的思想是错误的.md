The "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" policy for grain has won the support of the broad masses of farmers, which is fully demonstrated by the vigorous production enthusiasm of the farmers. Many rural work cadres have seized this favorable opportunity to organize the farmers' production enthusiasm into the current spring plowing production, leading them to increase fertilizer accumulation, expand investment, and cultivate meticulously... A prosperous scene of striving for a bumper harvest has formed in the countryside.

However, at the same time, people can also hear some wonderful voices: "This has solved the problem. With a single command in the autumn, the grain will be purchased completely." "We have been busy with unified purchase and sales for the past two years, and we can hardly breathe. Now, we can take a break." This kind of slackening off thought should be criticized.

The "three fix" policy has greatly improved the farmers' production enthusiasm, and it is a weapon to promote the current spring plowing production. Only by continuously developing production can the grain problem be gradually solved. However, due to various limitations, China's grain cannot fully meet the needs of the country and the people, and it cannot be completely avoided for a considerable period. Therefore, we must always be vigilant and pay attention to the grain issue: first, pay attention to grain production, and at the same time, pay attention to grain purchase and sales; if any link goes wrong, it will affect the overall situation and produce serious consequences.

Where is the error of the slackening off thinking mentioned above? First of all, it will relax the leadership of the current production work, causing the spring plowing and sowing to fall into a state of free flow. In this way, the completion of the grain production increase plan will lose its guarantee; in the autumn, the grain unified purchase task will not be easy to complete. Secondly, it will relax the current grain unified sales work. Now is the time when the old grain is running out and the new grain is not yet available, and the grain supply problem is being brought to the agenda more and more urgently. This requires us to do a lot of hard work, and we should never relax; if we relax grain unified sales now, it will not only affect the current spring plowing production, but also affect future work. This is very wrong!

We must overcome the thought of slackening off, be conscientious and meticulous, overcome difficulties, correctly implement the "three fix" policy, and lay the foundation for gradually solving the grain problem with hard work.

    松劲的思想是错误的
  　蔡惠
    粮食“定产、定购、定销”政策得到广大农民的拥护，这从农民们蓬蓬勃勃的生产积极性上充分表现出来。许多农村工作干部抓住这个有利的时机，把农民的生产积极性组织到当前的春耕生产中，领导他们增积肥料，扩大投资，精耕细作……农村里，形成一片争取丰收的繁荣景象。
    可是，与此同时，人们也可以听到一些奇妙的声音：“这就有办法了。秋天一声号令，粮食马上购齐。”“这两年忙着统购统销，气都喘不过来。这一来，可以歇一歇了。”这种松劲思想，应该受到批判。
    “三定”政策大大提高了农民的生产积极性，它是推动当前春耕生产的武器。只有不断地发展生产，才能逐步解决粮食问题。但由于各种条件的限制，我国粮食不能充分地满足国家和人民的需要，在一个相当长的时期内是不能完全避免的。因此，我们必须时时刻刻警惕地注视着粮食问题：首先注意粮食的生产，同时注意粮食的收购和销售；那一个环节发生错误，都会影响全局，产生严重的后果。
    上面说的那些松劲的思想的错误在那里呢？首先，它会放松对当前生产工作的领导，而使春耕播种陷于自流状态。这样，粮食增产计划的完成就会失掉保证；到秋天，粮食统购任务也就不容易完成了。其次，它会放松当前的粮食统销工作。目前正是青黄不接的时候，粮食供应问题一天天迫切地提到议事日程上来。这就需要我们做许多艰苦的工作，决不应该放松；如果现在放松粮食统销，不仅会影响当前的春耕生产，而且会影响今后的工作。这是非常错误的！
    必须克服松劲思想，兢兢业业，克服困难，正确贯彻“三定”政策，用艰苦的工作打下逐步解决粮食问题的基础。
