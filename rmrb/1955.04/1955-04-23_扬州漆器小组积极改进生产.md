    In the first quarter of 1955, lacquerware artisans in Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, completed the first batch of orders for the Chinese Artists Association: eleven beautiful sets of folding screens and one hundred sets of small lacquer boxes with soft colors.
      Yangzhou's lacquerware handicrafts have a profound and simple style and have been exhibited many times at the East China and National Art and Craft Exhibitions. It enjoys a high reputation along with lacquerware from Fujian, Beijing, and Chongqing. The Yangzhou lacquerware artisans have formed a lacquerware production group. Ding Changkang, a jade worker with forty-eight years of experience and sixty-one years old, came from the countryside to join the group. The organized lacquerware group is actively improving production and focusing on researching and improving artistic standards. When making lacquer screens, the artisans have changed to using yellow ivory wood instead of lacquer ash to make the trees, making the lacquer screens more beautiful and durable.
      Currently, they are actively producing the second batch of products—sixteen sets of "Eight Treasures Inlaid" and carved lacquer folding screens, and two hundred sets of lacquer boxes. This batch of products is scheduled to be delivered to Beijing before June.

    扬州漆器小组积极改进生产
    一九五五年第一季度，江苏省扬州市的漆器手工艺者，已为中国美术家协会完成了第一批订货任务：十一堂美丽的围屏和色泽柔和的一百套小漆盒。
      扬州市的手工艺品漆器有浑厚朴实的风格，曾多次在华东和全国美术工艺展览会上展出，它和福建、北京、重庆的漆器同样获得很高声誉。扬州市漆器手工艺者成立了漆器生产小组，有四十八年工龄、六十一岁的玉工丁长康，特地从乡下赶来入组。组织起来的漆器小组正在积极改进生产，并着重研究和提高艺术水平。艺人们在做漆屏时，改用黄牙木代替漆灰制作树木，使漆屏更加美观和坚固。
      目前，他们正在积极生产第二批产品——十六堂“八宝镶嵌”和雕漆的围屏，二百套漆盒。这批产品准备在六月以前送到北京。
