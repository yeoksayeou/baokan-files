Hu Feng's literary thought is a reactionary bourgeois literary thought, and this thought is also reflected in his views on the content and form of literature. The purpose of this article is to expose the reactionary essence of Hu Feng's literary thought on this issue.

First, let's talk about the formulation of the question.

Literature is a social phenomenon, so in literature, the issue of content and form cannot be viewed solely from the perspective of literature itself, but must first be viewed from the perspective of the social class struggle. It is true that the content of a work, the author's ideology, etc., determine the form of the work. However, content determines form only in terms of general direction. The same content may have a variety of forms. As for why a certain content takes a certain form, it is primarily related to the social life and the situation of class struggle at that time. For example, the New Culture Movement of the May Fourth period, the literary style reform that emerged at that time was precisely what the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary movement demanded. I completely agree with A. Yegorov's statement that "artistic form is determined not only by the characteristics of the object being reflected, but also by the special needs of social practice." ("Study Translation Series," 1955, No. 3, p. 49). Yes, we must look at the content and form issue from the overall struggle situation in order to fully understand the relationship between content and form; otherwise, we will only isolate literary phenomena from society. In literature, content determines form on the basis of a certain social life and struggle. These lives and struggles provide the author with the content to be reflected, and also influence the author to adopt a certain form.

I think this proposition is very important. Because it is precisely based on this objective law that we encourage writers to create in forms that the people love to see and hear. Zhdanov also used this law to rebuke those naturalist and formalist musicians. He said, "We have forgotten that great masters of musical art do not shy away from any style, as long as these styles help to advance musical art to the broad masses of the people." ("Problems of Soviet Literature and Art," p. 110)

But Hu Feng is not like this. From the beginning, he talks about literature in terms of literature. He clings to the proposition of the unity of content and form, that content determines form, without realizing that the more fundamental proposition is: literature is a social phenomenon. Hu Feng does not understand this point, so he isolates the issue of content and form. This is the first point.

Secondly, the scope of what we call the artistic and literary front is very broad. Of course, we must attach importance to great works that are loved by millions of people, but at the same time, we must also pay attention to the broad range of mass art. As pointed out in the Resolution "On the Policy of the Party in the Field of Literature and Art" of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on June 18, 1925: "Part of the growth of this mass culture is the growth of new literature—primarily the growth of proletarian and peasant literature, from its embryonic but at the same time unprecedentedly broad forms (worker correspondents, rural correspondents, wall newspapers, and others) up to literary works with strong ideological content." Because the scope of artistic literature is very broad, when we talk about the issue of content and form in literature, we cannot fail to consider the entire literary and art front, how to carry out propaganda and education among the broad masses of the people, and how to make literature and art a cultural nourishment for the masses and be loved by them.

But Hu Feng is not like this. He looks down on the people, he looks down on the embryonic state of the literature of the masses, and he does not attach importance to the political effects of literature. Because of this, his vision is narrow, and when he talks about content and form, he can only speculate and guess from the partial literary phenomena he sees. This is the second point.

Furthermore, we believe that the content and form of literature in a particular period are related to the customs and habits of the people and the cultural level of the people. The people's own creations influence the writers, and the people's cultural requirements also influence the writers, not only influencing the content of the works, but also influencing their form. Gorky's many essays are permeated with the idea of the mutual influence and enrichment of the artist's creative personality and the people's creation. And G. S. Potapov, in his article "Soviet Folk Creation is a New Stage in the History of Folk Creation," also said: "...but some styles of folk creation still completely retain this orality. This is not due to remnants, not merely determined by a 'force of tradition' (as some people mistakenly assume), but precisely the result of the Soviet people's need for this oral, literary creation and dissemination method." ("Introduction to Soviet Folk Oral Creation," p. 47) In this way, when talking about content and form in literature, we must connect it to the general cultural life, tastes, and customs of the people at that time.

But Hu Feng is not like this. He believes that the content and form of literature are determined by the author himself, and have nothing to do with the cultural level, tastes, and customs of the people at that time. And he also dogmatically said that "'what the masses are accustomed to seeing and hearing,' 'what they are familiar with and feel close to,' has nothing in common with the scientific truth that 'the dynamism of form is nothing but the use of special forms to express the dynamism of the content of the development process itself,' and can only be a response to the reactionary proposition that 'whatever exists is rational.'" ("On the Issue of National Form," p. 55) Hu Feng extremely despises what the masses are accustomed to seeing and hearing, believing that it is not enough to serve as a constituent element of new forms. This is the third point.

In this way, Hu Feng's departure from politics, from the masses, and from the cultural life of the people to talk about the issue of content and form means that his starting point is already wrong, then his deep plunge into the abyss of fallacy can only be said to have a "fatalistic" character.

Now let us further study his views on the content and form of artistic literature itself.

First is the issue of the interpretation of content and form. That is, what is the content of literature and what is the form of literature.

From the perspective of epistemology, objective existence is content, while human ideology is form. (See "Stalin's Complete Works," Vol. 1, p. 291) In this sense, the difference between literature and science lies in the fact that literature reflects things through the form of images, while science reflects objective things through forms such as conceptual formulas. The difference between the two lies in the different forms of reflection. But as far as literature itself is concerned, the content of literature is the realistic phenomena that the author feels, is aware of, and illuminates with the light of a certain social ideal. Only thoughts and knowledge cannot constitute the content of a work, and only descriptions of things cannot constitute the content of a work. The content of a work includes the object being described. As for the image, it is both content and form. It is content because the writer's thinking is carried out in images; but at the same time, it is also form, because it contains many thoughts, and it is the embodiment of thoughts. As for the style of writing and the structure of the plot, those are the forms of expression of the content of the literary image.

But Hu Feng is not like this. He believes that "starting from the method of realism, content is the scientific knowledge embodied in concrete images, and form is the concrete image that has passed through scientific knowledge." ("On the Issue of National Form," p. 73) Here, Hu Feng simply regards the image as having only the meaning of form. We all know that when a writer creates, he needs to think in images, and this kind of thinking itself has concreteness and also has the meaning of content. If we follow Hu Feng's statement, and the concrete image only has the form of scientific thought, and is mainly the meaning of form, then the so-called content of the work can only be an abstract understanding with some appearances. Since content determines form, then the writer can only look for concrete images based on abstract knowledge, and the creative process can only become the process of finding concrete images to embody abstract knowledge. Obviously, such an explanation completely obliterates the characteristics of image thinking. Hu Feng often scolds people for vulgar sociology. I think it is precisely Hu Feng who has fallen into the mire of vulgar sociology.

Second is the historical tradition of content and form. In our view, our revolutionary literature today, on the one hand, is a reflection of objective reality in our minds, but on the other hand, our revolutionary literature today is precisely the historical development of our past progressive classical literature in China. Of course, this development includes qualitative changes.

But Hu Feng is not like this. He believes that the Chinese nation is a nation without culture, and therefore has no literary heritage to inherit. He completely denies the progressive tradition of our classical literature, believing that the ideological elements of democracy "have either been destroyed or been blocked in the primitive state of dreams" ("On the Issue of National Form," p. 49), but at the same time, on the other hand, he extremely worships the culture of foreign capitalism. He said, "...the Chinese people, with it as their leader (referring to the Chinese urban class - Yaomian), launched a great literary revolution, and from the hundreds of years of accumulated democratic struggle experience in the advanced countries (referring to capitalist countries - Yaomian) in general ideology and literature and art, they excitedly found a rich source of creative methods that could organize their understanding of real life and express their feelings about real life." ("On the Issue of National Form," p. 50) In this way, Hu Feng not only cuts off the historical development thread of Chinese realistic literature, distorts the significance of May Fourth literature, and gives the leadership to the urban class, but also shamelessly prostrates himself at the feet of the reactionary literati Hu Shi's theory of "total Westernization" and cosmopolitanism. Hu Feng does not understand and is unwilling to understand that many of our great works in the past did not serve the feudal dynasty as the superstructure of feudal society, but existed as exposing the darkness of the feudal system and as embodying the hopes and demands of the people, and they are precisely the things of the people themselves.

Similarly, on the issue of form, Hu Feng also extremely despises national traditions. He believes that the forms of Chinese literature in the past "are all determined by the 'fatalistic' character prescribed by the content of feudal consciousness." Hu Feng does not understand and is unwilling to understand that as long as we adhere to the progressive position of literature, we can and should use old forms. Content determines form, new content can create new forms, and at the same time, it can also use old forms. Creating new forms and using old forms are not opposed to each other. Yes, the old literary forms are determined by the old literary content; but once the form is created, it has relative independence. Of course, some of the forms die with the death of its content, but some of the forms are preserved as aesthetic factors and as a literary heritage. Even in the literature of the feudal class, there is not a lack of beautiful forms that we can extract. The working class is the inheritor of all excellent human culture. In order to create beautiful literature, he cannot work on bare ground or be satisfied with the empty slogan of "content determines form." He must use the existing forms, transform, supplement, and make it serve the new content, and create new forms from here. Therefore, Hu Feng's vilification of Chinese old forms is actually using leftist empty talk to destroy the creation of real new forms.

Lenin said, "We must preserve those beautiful things, take them as models, and start from them again, even if they are 'outdated things'" ("Marxism and Literature," p. 205). He also said that new ideological content "can and should be expressed in either new or old forms, can and should transform, conquer, and subdue all forms, not only new forms, but also old forms—but not to reconcile with old forms, but to be good at turning all new and old forms into weapons used by communism to achieve complete and final, firm and thorough victory." ("Selected Works of Lenin," Two-Volume Edition, Vol. 2, p. 766)

You see, Lenin advocated that new content can conquer all new and old forms to express itself, while Hu Feng believes that new content can only have new forms. In this way, Hu Feng loves to scold people for being "RAPP" faction members, but isn't he himself falling into the mire of the "RAPP" faction?

Third is the issue of the interrelationship between content and form in development.

In order to deny national forms, Hu Feng especially emphasizes the concept of the development of form. He said, "National form is not a fixed concept, but must develop (change) with the development of content and with the development (change) of historical requirements" ("Hu Feng's Opinions on Literary and Art Issues"—hereinafter referred to as "Opinions," p. 80).

Of course, no one has ever said that national form is forever standing still and not moving forward. But it must be understood that a nation is a stable community of people formed in history who share a common language, a common territory, a common economic life, and a common psychological state expressed in a common culture. And the national language, which is the primary symbol of national form, its grammar and basic vocabulary change very slowly and may remain for a long period of time. In this way, Hu Feng's theory of the parallel development of content and form, that is, that content changes and form changes, is very wrong and fundamentally contrary to Marxism-Leninism.

In order to prove the correctness of his argument, Hu Feng also quoted Stalin's words, saying that the conflict "exists between the old form and the new content, because the new content seeks a new form and tends toward a new form." ("Opinions," p. 83) And he also noted that it was quoted from "Stalin's Complete Works," Vol. 1, p. 292. Open "Stalin's Complete Works," Vol. 1, p. 292, and it is true that there is this footnote. But if we read all the way down from p. 291, we can know that this footnote quoted by Hu Feng has a supplementary meaning, while Stalin's main point is precisely the opposite of the opinion that Hu Feng is trying to prove. On p. 291, Stalin said, "In the process of development, content precedes form, and form lags behind content." He also said, "But the problem is that this or that form, because it lags behind its own content, can never completely suit this content, so the new content 'has to' temporarily be hidden in the old form, thus causing a conflict between them."

Obviously, Stalin's proposition is completely consistent with the proposition of Marx and Lenin. He made a more detailed supplement to the proposition of "content determines form" and "unity of content and form." Here we can see that our "theory" differs from Hu Feng's in the following three points. First, we believe that content precedes form and form lags behind content, but Hu Feng believes that form and content must develop in parallel or correspondingly; second, we believe that since form lags behind content, therefore, new content often has to be temporarily hidden in old forms, but Hu Feng believes that new content can only take new forms, and old forms cannot exist. Whoever considers it is a national restorationist. Third, we believe that new content conflicts with old forms, and finally new content breaks through old forms and constitutes new forms, but the new form itself is not completely isolated from the old form. Chairman Mao's saying of "bringing forth the new through the old" is exactly what this means. But Hu Feng is not like this. He believes that new forms are isolated from old forms. New forms can only be transplanted from foreign countries. You see, isn't Hu Feng's anti-Marxist-Leninist literary thought very obvious?

Fourth is the issue of views on national form. Hu Feng believes: "Striving for the development of 'national form' is actually striving for the 'new democratic content' to be able to obtain a more victorious artistic expression." ("Opinions," p. 88) Of course, we do not oppose artistic expression. But the problem is that Hu Feng attempts to use his "artistic expression" to eliminate national form. In his view, national form cannot have artistic expression, so for the sake of art, we have no choice but to abandon national form. In his view, national form is opposed to the creation of new forms, so for the sake of creating new forms, we have no choice but to abandon old forms.

But the proposition of "socialist content, national form" is well known. So how to explain this national form? So Hu Feng quoted a passage from Stalin, namely, "socialist in its content and national in its form, that is, national in its language." Then Hu Feng gave an explanation saying, "This is the only principle for understanding national form in literature." ("Opinions," p. 80)

Obviously, Hu Feng is again distorting Stalin's meaning here. We know that language is the first symbol of national form, but it is not the only symbol. As far as we know, national form also includes national living habits, such as the actions and expressions of characters with national characteristics, it also includes the traditions of historical culture, such as various historical legends and character stories, and it also includes the structure and style of the works. Hu Feng's attempt to simplify national form into just a language issue is nothing more than an attempt to eliminate national form.

Hu Feng is very disgusted with national form. He not only reduces it to a simple issue of national language, but also further reduces the language issue to the issue of oral language records. He said: "In order for the language (writing) to be used as the basic material of literary and artistic form to be able to reflect the content, color, and rhythm of the national (masses') life as richly as they are in themselves, the national (masses') spoken language must be able to be recorded on paper in the same way as the original sound." ("On the Issue of National Form," pp. 92-93) In this way, Hu Feng completely obliterates the issue of the typification and personalization of language and prostrates himself at the feet of naturalism in language. At the same time, Hu Feng also degrades national form to just an issue of oral language records. On this point, he happens to have something in common with the reactionary Hu Shi.

Why is Hu Feng so disgusted with national form and always wants to use all methods to obliterate and distort it? I think, as long as we see how he emphasizes the literary tradition of "the urban class as the leader," how he values the forms transplanted from capitalist countries, and how he emphasizes the need to express "the fighting demands hidden in life," then we will not find it difficult to understand that Hu Feng's main intention is to attempt to use his bourgeois literary line to resist the Marxist-Leninist literary line.

Finally, there is the issue of form and technique in literature. In our view, content is dominant, but we never neglect form and technique. Chairman Mao told us in his speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, "Our requirement is the unity of politics and art, the unity of content and form, and the unity of revolutionary political content and the most perfect artistic form possible." And Gorky also said, "Young people! It is very useful for you if you understand that it is not the material but the technology that often plays a decisive role in work. From the round stick of birch, you can make both an ax handle and carve a beautiful human figure." ("Marxism and Literature," p. 288) From the above words, it can be seen that both Chairman Mao and Gorky attach great importance to form and technique.

But Hu Feng is not like this. In his essays of literary criticism, he rarely talks about the issue of form and technique. He looks down on form and technique very much. Not only that, he even severely ridiculed some comrades who studied form and technique. Even in his criticism of the "Literary Gazette," he was still mocking the discussion on the form of poetry held by the Writers Association, believing that discussing form is formalism and surrendering to bourgeois aesthetics. In fact, studying form and technique is the job of writers and literary critics. If we can further improve the technique and make the form more perfect, so that it can better serve our progressive content and make our progressive literary content have more brilliance and produce a greater impact, what is wrong with that? Do we have to express progressive ideological content in a crude form to be considered revolutionary?

I know what Hu Feng's intention is in this kind of proposition. It turns out that in his view, the main thing about literature is to express the wildness of survival and the primitive vitality. That is to say, he wants us to worship primitivism. But we must tell Hu Feng that we can never allow this kind of reactionary literary proposition to spread unchecked.

    评胡风对文学的内容和形式的看法
    黄药眠
    胡风的文艺思想是反动的资产阶级的文艺思想，这种思想同样也表现在他对于文学的内容和形式的看法上。本文的目的，就是想就这个问题揭露胡风文艺思想的反动本质。
    现在先谈问题的提法。
    文学是社会现象，因此在文学里面，内容和形式的问题，就不能光从文学本身去看，而是首先要从社会阶级斗争的形势去看。不错，作品的内容、作者的思想意识等决定着作品的形式。但内容决定形式，只是指一般方向的决定。同一个内容可能有多种多样的形式。至于这一个内容，为什么采取这一个形式，首先是和当时的社会生活、阶级斗争的形势有关系的。比方“五四”的新文学运动，当时所产生的文体改革正是当时的反帝反封建革命运动所要求的。我完全同意阿·叶高洛夫的话，“艺术形式不仅是由被反映的对象的特点决定的，而且是由社会实践的特殊需要决定的。”（“学习译丛”一九五五年第三期四九页）。是的，必须从整个斗争形势去看内容和形式问题，我们才能够充分理解内容和形式的关系问题；否则只有把文学现象和社会割裂开来。在文学里面，内容决定形式是在一定的社会生活和斗争的基础上来进行的。这些生活和斗争向作者提供了他所要反映的内容，同时也影响着作者去采取一定的形式。
    这一个命题，我认为很重要。因为正是根据这一个客观规律，我们才鼓励作家要用人民所喜闻乐见的形式来创作。日丹诺夫也曾根据这个规律斥责了那些自然主义和形式主义的音乐家们。他说：“我们忘记了：音乐艺术大家是对任何样式都不回避的，只要这些样式有助于把音乐艺术推进到广大人民群众中去。”（“苏联文学艺术问题”一一○页）
    但是胡风不是这样，他一开始就是就文学谈文学。他死抓内容和形式统一，内容决定形式的命题，而没有了解到更基本的命题是：文学是社会现象。胡风不了解这一点，所以他也就把内容和形式的问题，孤立起来看了。这是第一点。
    其次，我们所说的艺术文学战线，它的范围是包括很广的。当然，我们必须重视那些为千万人所爱读的伟大作品，但同时我们也得注意广泛的群众文艺。诚如俄共（布）中央一九二五年六月十八日的决议“关于党在文艺方面的政策”所指出的：“这种群众文化成长的一部分是新文学的成长——首先是无产阶级和农民的文学的成长，从其萌芽的但同时在范围方面空前广泛的形式（工人通讯、农村通讯、墙报及其他）起，直到思想性很强的文艺作品为止。”因为艺术文学所包涵的范围很广，所以当我们谈到文学的内容和形式问题的时候，就不能不考虑到整个的文艺战线，不能不考虑到怎样在广大的人民大众当中进行宣传教育问题，怎样使文艺成为大众的文化食粮而为他们所喜爱的问题。
    但是胡风不是这样，他看不起人民，他看不起人民大众的萌芽状态的文学，他是不重视文学的政治效果的。正因为这样，所以他的视野是狭小的，谈起内容和形式来，也就只能从他所看见的片面的文学现象去揣摩猜测。这是第二点。
    再其次，我们认为某一特定时期的文学的内容和形式问题，是和当时的人民的风俗习惯、人民的文化水准有关的。人民自己的创作影响到作家，人民的文化要求同样也影响到作家，不仅影响到作品的内容，同时也影响到它的形式。高尔基的许多论文中，就贯穿着艺术家的创作个性和人民创作的相互影响、相互丰富的思想。而高斯波塔列夫在论“苏联人民创作是人民创作史中的新阶段”一文里，也曾说过：“……但是人民创作的某些风格仍然完全保留着这种口头性。这不是由于残余，不是仅仅由于一种‘传统的力量’决定的（像某些人错误地设想那样）而正是苏联人民需要这种口头的、文学的创作和传播的方法的结果。”（“苏联人民口头创作引论”四十七页）这样看来，当谈到文学中的内容和形式时，我们是必须联系到当时一般人民的文化生活、趣味和风尚的。
    但是胡风不是这样。他认为文学的内容和形式都是由作者自己决定，和当时人民的文化水准、趣味和风尚无关。而且还武断地说“‘大众所习见常闻’，‘为他们所熟悉、所感到亲切’，这和‘形式底能动性不过是用着特殊的形态表现发展过程底内容本身的能动性的东西’这一科学的真理没有任何共通之点，只能是对于‘存在的皆是合理的’这一反动命题的呼应。”（“论民族形式问题”五十五页）胡风极端蔑视人民大众所习见常闻的东西，认为它并不足以作为新的形式的构成因素，这是第三点。
      这样看来，胡风脱离政治，脱离群众，脱离人民的文化生活去谈内容与形式问题，他的出发点就已经错了，那末他之深陷于谬误的深渊，也就只好具有“宿命的”性格了。
    现在让我们再进一步来研究一下他对于艺术文学的内容和形式本身的看法。
    首先是关于内容和形式的解释问题。也就是说什么是文学的内容，什么是文学的形式的问题。
    从认识论看，客观存在是内容，而人的思想意识则是形式。（参看“斯大林全集”第一卷二九一页）在这一个意义上，文学和科学不同之处是在于文学是通过形象的形式去反映事物，而科学则是通过概念公式等形式去反映客观事物。两者之不同，是在于反映的形式不同。但是就文学本身说，文学的内容乃是作者所感触到的，所意识到的，和以一定的社会理想的光芒去照耀的现实现象。光是思想认识不能构成作品的内容，光是事物的描写也不能构成作品的内容。作品的内容是包涵着所描写的对象在内的。至于形象，它是内容，又是形式。它是内容，因为作家的思维就是形象地进行的；但同时又是形式，因为它包涵着有许多思想，它是思想的体现。至于文章的体裁，情节结构，那是文学形象内容的表现形式。
    但是胡风不是这样。他认为“由现实主义的方法出发，内容是体现在具体的形象里面的、科学的认识，形式是通过了科学的认识的、具体的形象。”（“论民族形式问题”七十三页）这里胡风把形象简单地看成是只有形式的意义。我们都知道作家创作的时候，需要形象地思维，这种思维本身具有具体性，同时也具有内容的意义。如果照胡风这样说法，具体的形象只是具有科学思想的形式，主要是形式的意义，那末所谓作品的内容也就只能是具有一些表象的抽象的认识。既然内容决定形式，那么作家也就只有根据抽象的认识去找寻具体的形象，而创作过程也就只有变成为抽象的认识，找寻具体形象来体现的过程。显然，这样的解释是完全抹煞了形象思维的特征的。胡风常常骂人庸俗社会学。我看倒正是胡风陷进到庸俗社会学的泥坑里去了。
    第二是内容和形式的历史传统问题。在我们看来，我们今天的革命文学，一方面是我们的头脑对于客观现实的反映，但在另外一方面，我们今天的革命文学却又正是我们中国过去进步的古典文学之历史的发展。当然这个发展是包涵着质的变化的。
    但是胡风不是这样。他认为中华民族是一个没有文化的民族，从而也就没有什么文学遗产可以继承。他完全否认我们的古典文学的进步传统，认为民主主义的思想成分，“不是摧毁了就是被阻留在梦想性的原始状态里面”（“论民族形式问题”四九页），但同时在另外一方面，他又极端崇拜外国资本主义的文化。他说，“……以它为盟主（指中国的市民阶级——药眠）的中国人民爆发了一个伟大的文学革命，从先进国（指资本主义国家——药眠）累积了几百年的、一般意识形态上的和文艺上的民主主义的斗争经验里面，惊喜若狂地找着了能够组织他们对于现实生活的认识，能够说出他们对于现实生活的感应的、创作方法上的丰富的源泉。”（“论民族形式问题”五十页）这样胡风就不仅是割断了中国现实主义的文学之历史发展的线索，曲解了五四文学的意义，把领导权送给市民阶级，而且还无耻地拜倒在反动文人胡适的“全盘西化”论的世界主义的门下。胡风不懂得而且也不愿意懂得，我们中国过去的许多伟大作品，它们并不是作为封建社会的上层建筑，为封建王朝服务，而是作为暴露封建制度的黑暗，作为体现人民的希望和要求而存在的，它们都正是人民自己的东西。
    同样在形式问题上，胡风也是极端蔑视民族传统的。他认为中国过去的文学的形式“都是被封建意识的内容所规定了‘宿命的’性格”。胡风不懂得，而且也不愿意懂得，只要我们坚持文学的进步的立场，我们是可以而且应该利用旧形式的。内容决定形式，新内容可以创造新形式，同时也可以利用旧形式，创造新形式和利用旧形式，并不是对立的。是的，旧的文学形式是为旧的文学内容所决定的；但当形式一被创造出来，它就具有了相对的独立性。当然其中有一部分形式是随它的内容的死亡而死亡了，但也有一部分形式作为美的因素，作为文学遗产而被保留下来。即使是在封建阶级的文学里面，也并不就没有美的形式可以给我们撷取了。工人阶级是人类一切优良文化的继承者，为了要创造出美好的文学，他就不能在光秃秃的地面上去从事工作，或者以“内容决定形式”的空喊为满足，他必须利用旧有的形式，加以改造，补充，使它为新的内容服务，并从这里去创造新形式。所以胡风诋毁中国的旧形式，实际上也正是以左倾的空谈来破坏真正的新形式的创造。
    列宁说过“我们必须保存那些美好的东西，拿它来做模范，从它再出发，即使它是‘陈旧了的东西’”（“马克思主义与文艺”二○五页）。又说，新的思想内容“无论在或新或旧的形式中都能够而且应该表现出来，都能够而且应该改造、战胜与征服一切的形式，不仅是新的形式，而且是旧的形式，——但并不是要与旧形式调和，而是要善于把所有一切新旧形式变为共产主义获得完全的和最后的、坚决的和彻底的胜利所运用的武器。”（“列宁文选”两卷集第二卷，七六六页）
    你瞧，列宁是主张新内容可以征服一切新旧形式把自己表现出来的，而胡风则认为新内容只能够有新形式。这样看起来，胡风最爱骂人“拉普”派，可不正是他自己掉进“拉普”派的泥沼里了吗？
    第三是内容和形式在发展中的相互关系问题。
  胡风为了否定民族形式，所以他特别强调形式之发
  展的概念。他说“民族形式不是固定了的概念，
  而是要随着内容的发展，随着历史要求的发展（变
  化）而发展（变化）的”（“胡风对文艺问题的意见”——以下简称“意见”，八十页）。
      当然谁也没有说过民族形式是永远原地踏步，
  不向前进的。但是必须明白，民族是历史上形成的
  一个有共同语言，有共同地域，有共同经济生活以
  及有表现于共同文化上的共同心理状态的稳定的人
  们共同体。而且作为民族形式的首要标志的民族语
  言，其语法及基本词汇却又都是变化得很慢，在很
  长的时期中都还可能保留着的。这样看起来，胡风
  所说的内容有什么变化，形式也就有什么变化的平
  行发展的理论是十分错误，而且根本和马克思列宁
  主义相反的。
      胡风为了证明他的论据的正确，他还引了斯大
  林的话，说冲突是“存在于旧形式和新内容之间，
  因为新内容寻求新形式，并且趋向于新形式。”（“意
  见”八十三页）并且还注明引自“斯大林全集”第
  一卷二九二页。打开斯大林全集第一卷二九二页来
  看，不错是有这一句附注。但如果从二九一页一路看下去，我们就可以知道胡风所引的这个附注是带有附带说明的意思，而斯大林的主要论点却正是恰好和胡风所企图证明的意见相反。在二九一页里面，斯大林说，“在发展过程中，内容先于形式，形式落后于内容。”又说“但是问题在于这种或那种形式因落后于自己的内容，始终不能完全适合于这个内容，于是新的内容‘不得不’暂时包藏在旧的形式中，因而引起它们之间的冲突。”
    显然斯大林的这个提法是和马克思列宁的提法完全一致的。他对于“内容决定形式”，“内容与形式统一”的命题作了更细致的补充。在这里可以看出我们和胡风的“理论”有以下的三点分歧。第一、我们认为内容先行于形式，形式是落后于内容的，但胡风则认为形式和内容是一定平行地或者是相应地发展的；第二、我们认为既然形式落后于内容，因此，新的内容常常不得不暂时包藏在旧形式中，但胡风认为新内容只能采取新形式，旧形式是不能存在的，谁要去考虑它，谁就是民族复古主义。第三、我们认为新内容和旧形式冲突，最后新内容突破了旧形式而构成了新形式，但新形式本身却又不是和旧形式完全绝缘的东西。毛主席说的推陈出新，正是这个意思。但胡风不是这样，他认为新形式是和旧形式绝缘的。新形式只有从外国去移植过来。你瞧，胡风的反马克思列宁主义的文艺思想还不是很明显吗？
    第四是对于民族形式的看法问题。胡风认为：
  “争取‘民族形式’的发展，实际上是争取‘新民主主义的内容’能够更胜利地得到艺术的表现。”（“意见”八八页）当然艺术的表现，我们是不反对的。但是问题是在于胡风企图用他这个“艺术的表现”来取消民族形式。在他看来，民族形式是不可能有艺术的表现的，因此为了艺术的缘故，就只好不要民族形式了。在他看来，民族形式是和新形式的创造对立的，因此为了创造新形式的缘故，就只好不要旧形式了。
    但是“社会主义的内容，民族的形式”这个命题是为大家所熟知的。那么怎样来解释这个民族形式呢？于是胡风又引了斯大林一段话，即“按其内容是社会主义的，按其形式是民族的，也就是按其语言是民族的”。接着胡风就来一个解释说“这是理解文学上的民族形式的唯一原则。”（“意见”八十页）
    显然，胡风在这里又是曲解了斯大林的意思。我们知道语言是民族形式的第一个标志，但并不是唯一的标志。据我们所知，民族形式，它还包涵着民族的生活习惯，如带有民族特性的人物之动作和表情等，还包涵着历史文化的传统，如各种不同的历史传说，人物故事等，也还包涵作品的结构和文体。胡风企图把民族形式简单化成为只是语言问题，其目的，也无非是企图取消民族形式。
    胡风对于民族形式是十分深恶痛绝的。他不仅把它还原为只是简单的民族语言问题，而且进一步把语言问题，还原到口语的纪录问题。他说：“要作为文艺形式的基本材料的语言（文字）能够使国民（大众）生活的内容、的色泽、的韵律，像它们本身那么丰富地得到反映，就得使国民（大众）的口头语言能够照原音一样地在纸面上纪录出来。”
  （“论民族形式问题”九二——九三页）这样胡风就把语言的典型化，个性化的问题完全抹煞，而拜倒在语言上的自然主义的足下。同时胡风也就把民族形式贬低到只是口头语纪录问题了。在这一点上，恰好他又是和反动派胡适有其相同之处。
    为什么胡风对于民族形式如此深恶痛绝，总是要用一切方法加以抹煞和歪曲？我想，只要看他如何强调以“市民为盟主”的文学传统，如何重视从资本主义国家移植过来的形式，如何强调要表现
  “生活里潜藏着的战斗要求”，那末我们就不难了解到胡风的主要意图乃是企图以他的资产阶级的文学路线来抵抗马克思列宁主义的文艺路线。
      最后是文学中的形式和技巧问题。在我们看来内容是主导的，但是我们从来也不忽视形式和技巧。毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话中，曾告诉我们
  “我们的要求则是政治和艺术的统一，内容和形式的统一，革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一。”而高尔基也曾说过“青年哟！假如你理解了：在工作时，常起决定的作用的并不是材料而是技术的话，那是对你很有用的。从白桦的圆棒上既可制造出斧柄，也可以雕刻出美好的人像。”（“马克思主义与文艺”二八八页）从以上这些话，可以看出无论是毛主席，无论是高尔基都是很重视形式和技巧的。
    但是胡风不是这样。在他的文学批评的论文中，谈到形式和技巧的问题是很少的。他非常看不起形式和技巧。不仅这样，他甚至对一些研究形式和技巧的同志们加以剧烈的嘲讽。就是在他批评“文艺报”的发言中，他也还在讥讽作家协会所举办的关于诗歌形式的讨论，认为讨论了形式就是形式主义，就是向资产阶级的美学投降。其实，研究形式和技巧，这乃是作家文学批评家份内的事情，如果我们能够把技巧更提高，形式弄得更完美，使它更能够为我们的进步内容服务，使得我们的进步的文学内容有更多的光彩，产生更大的影响，这有什么不好呢？难道我们一定要把进步的思想内容用简陋的形式来表现才能够算是有革命性么？
    我是知道胡风的这种主张，其目的何在的。原来在他看来文学主要的是要把求生的野性、原始的生命力表现出来。也就是说，他要我们去崇拜原始主义。但是我们必须告诉胡风，我们是绝对不能让它这种反动的文学主张泛滥开去的。
