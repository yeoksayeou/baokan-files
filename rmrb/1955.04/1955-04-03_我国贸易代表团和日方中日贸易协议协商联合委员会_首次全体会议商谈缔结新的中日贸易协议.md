Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 2nd. On the afternoon of the 1st, the Chinese Trade Delegation to Japan and the Japanese side Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement Consultation Joint Committee, jointly formed by the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade, held the first plenary meeting to discuss the conclusion of a new Sino-Japanese trade agreement.

    The Chinese side was represented by Lei Renmin, head of the delegation, Li Zhucheng and Lu Xuzhang, deputy heads, the secretary-general, and a total of fourteen members.

    The Japanese side was represented by Shozo Murata, chairman of the Joint Committee, Masanosuke Ikeda, vice-chairman, and thirteen members, with one member absent.

    At the meeting, Shozo Murata delivered a speech. He first expressed his desire to restore the traditional economic relations between China and Japan. He reviewed the implementation of the two Sino-Japanese trade agreements signed in 1952 and 1953. He pointed out that Japan's exports to China are subject to various restrictions, and unless these restrictions are lifted, trade between the two countries will be difficult to normalize. He said that in order to eliminate these obstacles, we must continue to work hard with the support of public opinion to ask the government to solve this problem. At the same time, we will further develop Sino-Japanese trade by signing a trade agreement through this consultation.

    Lei Renmin said in his speech that China and Japan have had long-term and close economic exchanges in history. China has abundant products to export, such as Chinese rice, soybeans, coal, salt, and iron sand, which are well known to the Japanese people and friends in the industrial and commercial circles. China is now undergoing national industrialization and needs a lot of materials for construction. Japan has a modern industry and many materials that China needs. This shows that China and Japan have full conditions for developing trade.

    Lei Renmin said that in recent years, the government of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people, industrial and commercial figures and organizations have made many efforts to restore trade between the two countries. The first Sino-Japanese trade agreement signed in 1952 was the beginning of the restoration of Sino-Japanese trade relations. Only 5.05 percent of the total trade volume stipulated in the agreement was realized. The implementation of the second Sino-Japanese trade agreement signed in October 1953 has made some progress, but by the end of 1954, only 38.8 percent of the total amount of 60 million pounds stipulated in the agreement had been completed. China's exports accounted for 50.41 percent of the total amount of the agreement, and category A commodities accounted for 37.37 percent of the total amount of the agreement, exceeding the proportion stipulated in the agreement; Japan's exports only accounted for 27.19 percent of the total amount of the agreement, and category A commodities were not exported at all. As a result, China's exports were more than Japan's exports, resulting in an imbalance in imports and exports.

    Lei Renmin pointed out that the reason for this imbalance is not because Japan does not have goods that can be exported to China, but because the Japanese government is implementing measures to restrict exports to China. Many of the commodities that China needs can be fully supplied by Japan. However, as a result of Japan's restrictions on exports to China, China has to purchase from other markets, even though Japan and China are the closest countries. It is obvious that as long as man-made obstacles are removed, Sino-Japanese trade will be truly developed.

    Lei Renmin emphasized that to develop international economic and trade relations, the continuous efforts of the people are important, but it is even more important for the government to assume its due responsibilities. This is the key to the current development of Sino-Japanese trade. All the measures and steps taken by the Japanese side in this regard are not only eagerly hoped for by the Japanese people, but will also be welcomed by the Chinese government and people.

    Lei Renmin said that regarding the new Sino-Japanese trade agreement, we are prepared to conduct consultations on the basis of the second Sino-Japanese trade agreement signed in October 1953, in accordance with the principles of equality and mutual benefit, and according to the needs and possibilities of both sides. Regarding commodity exchange, we are willing to consider supplying all the commodities that China has historically exported to Japan and that Japan needs, such as soybeans, coal, salt, iron sand, other minerals, native products, animal products, food, etc. At the same time, we hope that the Japanese side will also follow the same spirit and attitude so that trade between the two countries can be fully developed.

    At the meeting, discussions were held on conducting plenary sessions and grouping issues. (Attached picture)

### 我国贸易代表团和日方中日贸易协议协商联合委员会  首次全体会议商谈缔结新的中日贸易协议

    我国贸易代表团和日方中日贸易协议协商联合委员会
    首次全体会议商谈缔结新的中日贸易协议
    新华社东京二日电　一日下午，中国访问日本贸易代表团和由日本国际贸易促进协会和日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟联合组成的日方中日贸易协议协商联合委员会举行了商谈缔结新的中日贸易协议的第一次全体会议。
    中国方面出席的有团长雷任民，副团长李烛尘、卢绪章和秘书长以及团员共十四人。
    日本方面出席的有联合委员会委员长村田省藏，副委员长池田正之辅和委员共十三人，一个委员缺席。
    会上，村田省藏致词。他首先表示了要求恢复中日两国在经济上的传统关系的愿望。他回述了一九五二年和一九五三年签订的两次中日贸易协议的执行情况。他指出：日本对中国的出口是受到种种限制的，这种限制如不解除，两国间之贸易就难于正常化。他说：为了排除这种种障碍，我们要在国民舆论的支持下不断努力，要求政府解决这一问题。同时，通过这次协商签订贸易协议来进一步开展中日贸易。
    雷任民在会上致词说：中、日两国在历史上曾有过长期的、密切的经济交流关系。中国有着丰富的物产可供输出，像中国的大米、大豆、煤、盐、铁砂等商品，是日本人民和工商界朋友们所熟知的。中国现在正在进行着国家工业化，需要建设的物资很多，日本有着近代化的工业，有很多物资是中国所需要的。这说明中日两国是具备了发展贸易的充分条件的。
    雷任民说：几年来，中华人民共和国政府、中国人民、工商界人士和团体对于恢复两国间的贸易曾做了不少的努力。一九五二年签订的第一次中日贸易协议是恢复中、日贸易关系的开端。协议规定的贸易总额只实现了百分之五点零五。一九五三年十月签订的第二次中日贸易协议执行情况稍有进步，但是至一九五四年底，也仅仅完成了协议规定的总额六千万英镑的百分之三十八点八，中国方面出口完成了协议总额的百分之五十点四一，甲类商品占协议总额的百分之三十七点三七，超过协议所规定的比例；日本方面出口只完成了协议总额的百分之二十七点一九，甲类商品完全没有出口。这样，中国的出口多于日本的出口，形成了进出不平衡状况。
    雷任民指出：这种不平衡之所以产生，并不是因为日本没有可以对中国出口的商品，而是因为日本政府执行着限制对中国出口的措施。中国需要的商品本来有很多是日本能够充分供应的。但是由于日本限制对中国出口的结果，中国只好向其他市场去购买，虽然日本和中国是相距最近的国家。事实很明显，只要排除了人为的障碍，中、日贸易就会得到真正的发展。
    雷任民强调说：要发展国际间的经济贸易关系，人民的不断努力固然是重要的，而由政府承担起应负的责任却是更为重要的条件，这正是当前发展中日贸易的关键所在。日本方面为此采取的一切措施和步骤，不仅是日本人民所急切希望的，同时也将受到中国政府和人民的欢迎。
    雷任民说：关于新的中日贸易协议，我们准备根据平等互利的原则，按照双方需要与可能，在一九五三年十月签订的第二次中日贸易协议的基础上进行商谈。关于商品交换方面，凡是中国历史上对日本输出而为日本所需要的商品，如大豆、煤、盐、铁砂、其他矿产、土产、畜产、食品等，我们都愿意考虑供应。同时我们希望日本方面也本着同样精神和态度，使两国贸易得到充分的发展。
    会上就进行全体会议和分组问题，进行了讨论。（附图片）
