Nanchang Grain Depots Have Done a Good Job in Moisture Prevention
    In Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, all grain depots have carried out moisture-proof and airtight measures for more than 80% of their stored grain, with the exception of a small amount reserved for supply. Many grain depots have sealed all the gaps in the granaries with waste paper and covered the grain surfaces with sacks. Some of the grain that had been affected by moisture was also treated with methods such as turning and drying and ventilation. As a result, the moisture content of 93.6% of the stored grain in the county has been reduced to within a safe storage level, and the grain depots in eleven districts have eliminated the risk of dangerous grain with high moisture content. In the past three months, there has been no occurrence of mold or sprouting in the grain depots throughout the county.
    In order to further consolidate the achievements in grain storage work, the grain departments of Nanchang County launched a "Grain Protection Blitz Week" campaign in all grain depots throughout the county in late March, and are preparing to organize the grain depots in each district to conduct inspections of grain storage conditions in separate areas in early April and to exchange experiences in grain storage work.

    南昌各粮库做好了防潮工作
    江西省南昌县各地粮食仓库除少数留作供应的粮食外，百分之八十以上的储粮都进行了防潮密闭工作。许多粮食仓库用废纸密闭了粮仓所有的缝隙，用麻袋遮盖了粮面。部分受潮的粮食，也都采用了翻晒、过风等办法加以处理。因此，全县百分之九十三点六的储粮的含水量都降到安全储存的程度以内，并有十一个区的粮食仓库消灭了高水分的危险粮食。三个月来，全县各粮食仓库未发生过粮食霉芽的现象。
    南昌县粮食部门为了进一步巩固保管粮食工作的成绩，三月下旬全县各粮食仓库又继续开展了“保粮突击周”运动，并准备在四月上旬组织各区粮库分片检查储粮的情况，和交流粮食保管工作的经验。
