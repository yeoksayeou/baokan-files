Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, April 21st: According to Antara News Agency on April 20th: The Indonesian National Peace Committee has submitted a petition to the heads of delegations of the countries participating in the Asian-African Conference. The petition hopes that the Asian-African Conference will achieve results consistent with the principles agreed upon at the Bogor Conference. The petition also requests the Asian-African Conference to commit to using atomic energy only for peaceful purposes.

The petition states that world tensions hinder the peaceful development of countries and nations. The root cause of this situation is related to colonialism. The people of Indonesia are still experiencing colonialism in West Irian. The petition emphasizes that in order to achieve world peace and happiness, colonialism must be eliminated, and people must be able to handle their own affairs freely without any external interference.

The petition hopes that the principles of peaceful coexistence will be based on international cooperation among the people of all countries in the world.

The petition concludes by expressing belief that the delegations will be faithful to the wishes of their people—who only want to live peacefully and achieve prosperity and happiness without foreign interference.

Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, April 21st: The People's Peace Conference held in Semarang, Indonesia for three days decided to submit the following proposals to the Asian-African Conference: 1. Prohibit the use of atomic weapons and demand the destruction of all existing atomic weapons; 2. Support the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence proposed by Premier Zhou Enlai, Prime Minister Nehru, and Prime Minister U Nu; 3. Defend the principles of the United Nations regarding the basic human rights of people's right to survival.

The conference also called on Indonesian scientists to jointly fight against the activities of certain countries that are now intensifying preparations for atomic warfare.

    印度尼西亚和平委员会希望亚非会议成功
    三宝垄举行人民和平会议决定向亚非会议提出建议
    新华社万隆二十一日电　据安塔拉通讯社二十日消息：印度尼西亚全国和平委员会向参加亚非会议的各国代表团团长递交了一份请愿书。请愿书希望亚非会议得到和已经在茂物会议上取得一致协议的原则相符合的结果。请愿书还要求亚非会议准备致力于使原子能只用于和平用途。
    请愿书说，世界紧张局势阻碍了国家和民族的和平发展。产生这种局势的根本原因是同殖民主义有关的。印度尼西亚人民目前仍然在西伊里安经历着殖民主义。请愿书强调说，为了获得世界和平和幸福，必须消灭殖民主义，同时人民必须能自由地处理他们自己的事务，而不受外界的任何干涉。
    请愿书希望和平共处的原则将以全世界各国人民之间的国际合作为基础。
    请愿书最后表示相信，各国代表团将忠于它们的人民的愿望——他们只希望能够过着和平的生活，在不受外国干涉的情况下获得繁荣和幸福。
    新华社万隆二十一日电　在印度尼西亚三宝垄举行了三天会议的人民和平会议决定向亚非会议提出下列建议：一、禁止使用原子武器并且要求销毁一切现有的原子武器；二、赞成周恩来总理、尼赫鲁总理和吴努总理提出的和平共处五项原则；三、保卫联合国关于人民生存权等基本人权的原则。
    会议还吁请印度尼西亚科学家共同进行斗争，反对某些国家现在正在加紧进行的准备原子战争的活动。
