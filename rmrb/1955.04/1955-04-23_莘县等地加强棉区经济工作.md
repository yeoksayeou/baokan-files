In major cotton-producing areas of Shandong Province, such as Shen County, Guangrao, Lijin, and Gaomi, confidence among cotton farmers in fulfilling the state's cotton production increase requirements has been boosted due to the strengthening of economic work in cotton-growing areas and guidance on cotton planting techniques. The Shen County Party Committee and County People's Government, through a series of meetings, implemented the cotton planting policy and specifically studied issues of loans, seeds, fertilizers, and technical guidance. They have trained over 800 technicians to assist cotton farmers with field management. Supply and marketing cooperatives have already supplied over 150,000 jin of oil cake and chemical fertilizers in the first quarter and will continue to supply 3.3 million jin of oil cake and chemical fertilizers, 57,000 jin of pesticides, and 340 sprayers and dusters to cotton farmers in the second quarter. The County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also signed contracts with more than 2,000 agricultural cooperatives and year-round mutual aid teams. Lijin, Gaomi, and Guangrao counties have also helped farmers solve seed problems. Guangrao, which originally lacked more than 60,000 jin of seeds, has now completely resolved the issue.

    莘县等地加强棉区经济工作
    山东主要产棉区莘县、广饶、利津、高密等县，由于加强了棉区经济工作和植棉技术的指导，棉农有信心完成国家对棉花增产的要求。莘县县委会和县人民政府，在一连串的会议上贯彻了植棉政策，具体地研究了贷款、种籽、肥料和技术指导问题。他们已训练了八百多技术人员，以便帮助棉农进行田间管理工作。供销合作社在第一季度已供应油饼、化学肥料十五万多斤，第二季度还继续将三百三十多万斤油饼、化学肥料，五万七千斤农药，三百四十架喷雾器喷粉器供给棉农。县供销合作社还和二千多个农业社长年互助组订了合同。利津、高密、广饶等县也都帮助农民解决了种籽问题。广饶原先缺种籽六万多斤，现已全部解决。（本报驻济南记者）
