The working people of the world commemorate the eighty-fifth anniversary of the birth of their great teacher and leader—Lenin—with reverence and gratitude. The great Lenin always regarded youth as the successors and developers of the older generation's cause. Lenin highly valued the role of youth. As early as before, he quoted Engels's words: "Our party is the party that holds the future, and the future belongs to the youth. Our party is the party of innovators, and the youth always follow the innovators most enthusiastically. Our party is the party that fights against the old and corrupt phenomena selflessly, and the youth will always be the first to fight selflessly." Lenin attached great importance to the education and cultivation of the younger generation. He profoundly pointed out the basic tasks, principles, and methods of carrying out communist education for the new generation, telling us how to cultivate the youth into conscious and active staunch socialist fighters. Cultivating new people is a necessary condition for the smooth realization of socialism and also an arduous task in our country's transition period. Therefore, profoundly understanding Lenin's legacy on youth education is of particularly great significance to our current stage.

Lenin first examined the issue of youth education from a class point of view. He pointed out that under the conditions of capitalist society, schools are tools of the bourgeoisie's rule and are led by bourgeois ideology. Then, under socialist conditions, schools should be tools for transforming society. Therefore, Lenin believed that the educational task of the younger generation is inextricably linked to the construction of a communist society. Lenin pointed out that the task of truly building a communist society is to be shouldered by the youth; the sole task of the new generation growing up in the new society is to build a communist society. Therefore, he called on the Youth League and all young people who want to move towards communism to study communism.

Lenin believed that the communist education of the younger generation is inseparable from the task of building socialist and communist societies. The building of socialism should be done by well-rounded new people. In the old society, mental and physical labor were opposed to each other, and cities and villages were opposed to each other, thus causing the one-sided development of people. The majority of the people were engaged in heavy physical labor, and they were extremely backward in terms of culture compared to a small number of mental laborers; on the other hand, a small number of mental laborers, although they possessed knowledge, were often at a loss when it came to applying it in practice. The true all-round development of people is only possible under the conditions of a socialist society; and all-round development education is a prerequisite for the further development of society. Lenin developed Marx and Engels's theory of all-round development. As early as 1897, he profoundly pointed out that if the productive labor of young people is not combined with teaching, then the ideal of future society is unimaginable. Lenin vigorously opposed the method of studying communism that separates theory from practice. The practical experience of Soviet education further enriched Lenin's educational thought on all-round development. Zhdanov once described the face of the new person under communist education. He said: "The younger generation should be educated to be steadfast, energetic, unafraid of obstacles, welcoming these obstacles, and good at overcoming them. Our people should be educated and cultured with lofty thoughts, and cultural and moral requirements should be very high."

So, how to study communism, and what is communist education?

Communist society is built on the basis of the latest science and technology. Therefore, communism is profound and comprehensive knowledge. Lenin repeatedly criticized those who were only satisfied with grasping communist slogans. Here, the first is the issue of cultural learning. Lenin pointed out that a communist society cannot be built in a country filled with illiteracy. He also said: "An illiterate person is standing outside of politics; he must first be taught to read. Without this, there can be no politics, without this, there is only rumor, empty talk, lies, and prejudice, not politics." He called on young people to take on this task themselves and help illiterate youth free themselves from darkness and ignorance. Currently, about 70 percent of our country's workers and peasants are illiterate or semi-illiterate. Therefore, eliminating illiteracy cannot but be an urgent and very arduous task for carrying out communist education for our country's youth.

Lenin also pointed out that in the cause of construction based on a high level of science and technology, it is far from enough to just be literate. A communist society can only be built on the basis of modern knowledge. Otherwise, communism will always be just a wish. At the same time, one can only become a communist by enriching one's mind with all the knowledge treasures created by mankind. Therefore, every young person must strive to seize the fortress of scientific knowledge.

Lenin's great successor Stalin further pointed out: "Now we need large numbers, thousands upon thousands, of new Bolshevik cadres who can become experts in various knowledge departments. Without these cadres, there is no talk of the rapid speed of our socialist construction. Without these cadres, there is no talk of our being able to catch up with and surpass the advanced capitalist countries."

He also said: "Master science, cultivate new Bolshevik cadres in various knowledge departments, learn, learn, and learn most persistently—this is the task now." "Revolutionary youth marching towards science, comrades, this is what we need now."

Now, the Chinese people are realizing the greatest transformation in history, building a socialist society in a country that accounts for a quarter of the world's population. Building socialism requires the latest science and technology, but our original scientific and technological foundation is very backward. Especially now that we are in the atomic age, the peaceful democratic socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is using atomic energy to push human culture to an unprecedentedly glorious state. However, the war group headed by US imperialism is preparing to use atomic weapons to massacre the people. All this tells us that Chinese youth must be determined to catch up with the atomic age, painstakingly learn from the advanced experience of the great Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, master the most advanced science and technology of mankind, and enrich their minds with all the knowledge of mankind. Just as our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly called on and encouraged us: "We must overcome difficulties, we must learn what we do not understand."

To be a true communist, it is not enough to just have scientific and technological knowledge. It is also necessary to have a high degree of communist consciousness, so that young people can wholeheartedly engage in creative labor to realize the great cause of communism. Lenin attached great importance to the moral education of young people. In his famous speech at the Third All-Russian Congress of the Russian Communist Youth League, he proposed: "The entire cause of educating, training, and cultivating modern youth should become the cause of cultivating communist morality among the youth."

What is communist morality? Lenin gave it a classic definition: "The struggle to consolidate and complete the cause of communism is the foundation of communist morality." Lenin pointed out that there is no eternally unchanging morality in the world. All morality is historical and has class character. The morality of the bourgeoisie serves the interests of maintaining the capitalist system. And our morality—Lenin said—completely submits to the interests of the proletariat's struggle. That is, it serves the interests of consolidating the socialist system. This means that anything that can consolidate the socialist system and promote the victory of communism is moral; anything that hinders the victory of socialism and communism is immoral. And anyone who can dedicate all their strength and energy to building a socialist society and striving for the victory of communism is the most moral person.

Starting from this spirit, Lenin pointed out that it is necessary to form such moral qualities in young people as love for the socialist motherland, a communist attitude towards labor, a communist attitude towards public property, a high degree of discipline, a spirit of collectivism, honesty and integrity, Bolshevik humility and adherence to principles, etc. This specifically defines the basic content of communist moral education. When talking about communist morality, we cannot fail to think that the life and activities of the great Lenin are the highest model of communist morality. As the announcement of the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party pointed out at the time of Lenin's death:
"In the history of the great proletarian liberation movement, after Marx, there has never been such a great figure as our deceased leader, teacher, and friend. Everything possessed by the truly great and heroic proletariat—the spirit of fearlessness, the steel-like, indomitable, invincible, resolute will, the sacred hatred for the system of enslavement and oppression, the revolutionary enthusiasm to move mountains and seas, the unlimited confidence in the creative power of the masses, the great organizational genius—all this found a magnificent embodiment in Lenin. Lenin's name has become a symbol of the new world from west to east and from south to north." Living, working, and struggling according to Lenin's example is the best way for us to cultivate the qualities of communist morality.

The great Lenin not only pointed out the tasks and content of communist education for us, but he also profoundly pointed out the basic methods of communist education for us, telling young people how to study communism. Lenin repeatedly emphasized the need to oppose the kind of education that separates theory from practice, because this kind of education will only cause the greatest harm to communism. He said that without work, without struggle, the communist knowledge from books obtained from communist pamphlets and writings is worth nothing. This kind of education will only create some communist bookworms or braggarts. Since educating young people is to enable them to build a new society, then every step of educating young people should be closely linked to the actual struggle to consolidate and complete the socialist cause.

How can we closely link the education of young people with the struggle to build a new society?

Lenin pointed out that during the transition period, the class struggle is still continuing, but it has changed its form. There is still a sharp struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Lenin also pointed out that under the situation of capitalist encirclement, the workers' republic must always be vigilant against the danger of new attacks. Therefore, the education of young people must first be linked to the class struggle and subordinate to this struggle. Lenin clearly said: "Young people can only learn communism by linking every step in their study, education, and training with the continuous struggle of the proletarians and laborers against the old exploiting society." Lenin's legacy is of particular importance to us today. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of our Party tells us that the socialist revolution to build our country into a great socialist country is a more profound and broader revolution than the revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and it contains extremely complex and acute struggles. In this struggle, on the one hand, foreign imperialism will never stand idly by; on the other hand, those domestic classes that have been overthrown will never be reconciled to their death, and those classes that will be eliminated will never be without resistance. The resolute counter-revolutionaries among them will inevitably collude with foreign imperialism, use every opportunity to sabotage the cause of our Party and the people, attempt to bring the cause of the Chinese revolution to failure, and restore reactionary rule in China. Therefore, our communist education for young people must be closely linked to the struggle against domestic and foreign class enemies.

This requires us to educate young people to always maintain revolutionary vigilance and eliminate the paralyzing thoughts that "everything is fine now" and "everything is peaceful." It is necessary to educate young people to regard serving in the military in accordance with the law as their sacred duty and bravely defend their motherland; it is necessary to educate young people to hate all counter-revolutionaries and ill-intentioned elements who conspire to sabotage the socialist construction and socialist transformation of the motherland, and resolutely fight against them.

At the same time, this also requires us to wage a resolute and continuous struggle against the phenomenon of capitalist ideology corroding young people. In the old society, people developed deeply ingrained psychological and habits such as "my purpose is only to make profit, and everything else has nothing to do with me." It takes a long time to change this psychology and habit. And we are cultivating new people among the masses of people who have not yet gotten rid of the influence of capitalism. As Lenin said, they are still stained with "innate capitalist stains." In particular, there is still a bourgeoisie in our country, who not only corrode young people with their ugly thoughts, but also with their decadent lifestyles. In the moral education that has been carried out recently, everyone has revealed many shocking examples, proving how harmful the bourgeois lifestyle and the idea of hedonism are to our youth. With the intensification of the class struggle during the transition period, the struggle reflected in ideology will inevitably become more acute. Lenin said: "Our task is to overcome the resistance of the capitalists, not only the military and political resistance, but also the most profound and powerful resistance in thought." The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) also emphasized in its resolution on primary and secondary schools in 1931: "During the socialist period, when the proletariat is thoroughly eliminating classes under the conditions of acute class struggle, the thorough communist education in Soviet schools, as well as intensifying the struggle against all attempts to instill non-proletarian ideology into the children of Soviet schools, is of great significance." Only by constantly struggling against bourgeois ideology can young people receive true communist education.

Another significance of linking the education of young people with the struggle to build a new society is to guide young people to consciously and actively participate in public labor and establish a new attitude towards labor. A new attitude towards labor is a necessary condition for improving labor productivity; fighting for high labor productivity is also fighting for communism. Lenin taught that everyone must see that every member of the Youth League is knowledgeable and good at labor. He also said: "To be a member of the Youth League is to use one's work and ability to serve the public cause. This is the essence of communist education. Only in the process of such work can young men and women be cultivated into true communists. Only when they can receive practical results in this work will they become communists." This means that true communist consciousness can only be produced in selfless labor for the public; the various selfishness psychology and habits brought about by the old society can only be gradually overcome and eliminated in selfless labor for the public. At the same time, only in this kind of labor can young people integrate with workers and peasants; and whether they can combine with the workers and peasants, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, is the standard of whether young people are revolutionary or not. Lenin demanded that the Youth League educate all young people from the age of twelve in conscious and disciplined labor; he demanded that the Youth League should be a shock brigade that can help with all work and show initiative and originality. This education of daily labor is also the most important communist education. We should educate every young person to persevere in completing any task assigned by the state; educate young workers to produce more and better products for the people; educate young peasants to take the road of cooperation and produce more grain to support national construction. In addition, regularly organizing young people to participate in various voluntary labor that is beneficial to public services is a matter of particularly profound educational significance. This kind of voluntary labor is also conducive to us to overcome the habit of being pampered and spoiled in the youth under the conditions of victorious development.

Communist education for young people is the responsibility of our entire Party and the entire society. However, the Youth League, as the Party's assistant and reserve army, bears a particularly important and glorious task. Stalin, in accordance with Lenin's spirit, gave a classic definition of the Youth League: "This is a mass organization of workers and peasants, a non-Party organization, but it is very close to the Party." The so-called "mass organization" means that it is not a closed, narrow small group, but should actively use its diverse political and organizational work to influence the broadest masses of young people of various classes and levels. As Lenin said: "The Youth League should become such a group that any worker feels that the doctrines of the people in this group may still be something he does not understand, and he may not believe them all at once, but from their practical work and activities, he sees that they are truly people who can point him in the right direction." The so-called "very close to the Party" means that it is infinitely loyal to the Party's thoughts and can truly educate the younger generation in the spirit of communism. The Youth League should prove with practical work that it is the Youth League that the great Lenin taught.

The Chinese New Democratic Youth League, following Lenin's teachings and taking the glorious Soviet Communist Youth League named after the great Lenin as its example for learning, is constantly correcting its shortcomings and constantly moving forward. Under the leadership of our beloved Party and great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, Chinese youth will more bravely hold high the glorious banner of Lenin and strive to thoroughly realize the great cause of socialism in China.

    列宁论青年共产主义教育
    ——为纪念列宁八十五周年诞辰而作
    胡耀邦
    全世界劳动人民怀着崇敬和感激的心情，纪念自己伟大的导师和领袖——列宁的八十五周年诞辰。伟大的列宁一直把青年看成是老一代的事业的继承者和发展者，列宁曾极高地估计了青年的作用。还在很早以前他就援引过恩格斯的这一段话：“我们党是掌握未来的党，而未来是属于青年的。我们党是革新者底党，而最热心地跟随着革新者走的总是青年。我们党是同陈旧腐败现象舍身奋斗的党，而首先去舍身奋斗的始终会是青年。”列宁对青年一代的教育和培养极为重视。他深刻地指出了对新一代进行共产主义教育的基本任务、原则和方法，告诉我们如何把青年培养成为自觉的、积极的社会主义坚强战士。培养新人，是顺利地实现社会主义的必要条件，也是我国在过渡时期的一项艰巨任务。因此，深刻地去领会列宁关于青年教育的遗训，对我国目前阶段有着特别重大的意义。
    列宁首先从阶级观点上考察了青年教育问题。他曾指出，在资本主义社会的条件下，学校是资产阶级统治的工具，是受资产阶级思想领导的，那末在社会主义条件下，学校就应当是改造社会的工具。因此列宁认为，青年一代的教育任务，同建设共产主义社会有着不可分割的联系。列宁指出，真正建立共产主义社会的任务正是由青年来担负；从新社会里成长起来的新一代的毕生的唯一任务就是建设共产主义社会，因此他号召青年团以及所有一般想走向共产主义的青年都应该学习共产主义。
    列宁认为青年一代的共产主义教育，同建设社会主义和共产主义社会的任务是不可分割的。建设社会主义的应该是全面发展的新人。在旧社会里，脑力劳动和体力劳动是对立的，城市和乡村是对立的，因此就造成了人的片面发展。大部分人民都作着粗重的体力劳动，比起一小部分脑力劳动者来，他们在文化方面是极为落后的；另一方面，一小部分脑力劳动者，他们虽然掌握着知识，但在实际应用它时，却常常束手无策。人的真正的全面发展，只有到社会主义社会的条件下才有可能；而全面发展的教育，又是社会进一步发展的前提。列宁发扬了马克思和恩格斯关于全面发展的学说，他远在一八九七年就曾深刻地指出：倘使不把青年生产劳动同教学结合起来，那么，关于未来社会的理想，是不可想像的。列宁曾竭力地反对了那种以理论同实践脱离的方法去学习共产主义。苏联教育的实际经验，进一步丰富了列宁关于全面发展的教育思想。日丹诺夫曾经描述了在共产主义教育下新人应具有的面貌。他说：“应该把年青的一代教育成为坚定不移、生气勃勃、不怕阻碍、迎接这些阻碍并善于克服它们的人。我们的人们，应该是有教养的和有崇高思想的人，而且文化和道德要求都应当很高。”
    那末怎样去学习共产主义，共产主义教育是什么呢？
    共产主义社会是在最新的科学技术基础上建立起来的。因此，共产主义就是深刻的全面知识。列宁曾不止一次地抨击那些只满足于掌握共产主义口号的人。这里首先是文化学习问题。列宁指出，在一个文盲充塞的国家内，是建设不了共产主义社会的。他还说：“一个不识字的人是站在政治以外的；必须首先教他学习识字。没有这一点，就不能有政治，没有这一点，那就只有流言、空谈、谎言与偏见，而不是政治。”他号召青年人自己把这一工作担负起来，帮助文盲青年从黑暗无知中解脱出来。现在我国工农青年中尚有百分之七十左右的文盲和半文盲，因此扫除文盲，就不能不是对我国青年实行共产主义教育的一项迫切而又十分艰巨的任务。
    列宁还指出，在高度的科学技术基础上进行建设的事业中，仅仅识字还是十分不够的。只有在现代知识的基础上，才能建立共产主义社会。否则共产主义就始终不过是一种愿望而已。同时，也只有用人类创造出来的全部知识宝藏来丰富自己的头脑时，才能成为共产主义者。因此，每一个青年都必须努力夺取科学知识的堡垒。
    列宁的伟大继承者斯大林更进一步指出：“现在我们需要大批大批的成千上万的能够在各种知识部门中成为行家的新的布尔什维克干部。没有这些干部，就谈不到我国社会主义建设的飞快速度。没有这些干部，就谈不到我们能赶上和超过先进的资本主义国家。”
    他又说：“掌握科学，培养各种知识部门的新的布尔什维克干部，学习、学习、最顽强地学习，——这就是现在的任务。”“革命青年向科学大进军，同志们，这就是我们现在所需要的。”
    现在中国人民正在实现历史上一次最伟大的变革，要在占世界人口四分之一的国家里建设起社会主义社会，建设社会主义需要最新的科学技术，而我们原有的科学技术基础却是非常落后的。特别是现在我们正处在原子时代，以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营，正在利用原子能把人类文化推向空前光辉灿烂的境地，但是以美帝国主义为首的战争集团，却准备用原子武器来屠杀人民。这一切告诉我们，中国青年必须下定决心追上原子时代，刻苦地向伟大苏联和人民民主国家的先进经验学习，掌握人类最先进的科学技术，用人类的全部知识来丰富自己的头脑。正像我们伟大领袖毛泽东同志一再号召和鼓励我们的那样：“我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。”
    为要做一个真正的共产主义者，仅仅有科学技术知识还是不够的。还必须具有高度的共产主义觉悟，使青年们忠心耿耿地去为实现伟大的共产主义的事业而创造性地劳动。列宁非常重视青年的道德教育。他在俄国共产主义青年团第三次全国代表大会上著名的演词中提出：“应该做到使教育、训练和培养现代青年的全部事业，都成为在青年中养成共产主义道德的事业。”
    什么是共产主义道德呢？列宁对它作了一个经典性的定义：“巩固与完成共产主义事业的斗争是共产主义道德的基础。”列宁指出，世界上永恒不变的道德是没有的。一切道德都是有历史性和阶级性的。资产阶级的道德是为维护资本主义制度的利益服务的。而我们的道德——列宁说——完全服从于无产阶级斗争的利益。也就是为了巩固社会主义制度的利益服务的。这也就是说，凡是可以巩固社会主义制度，可以促进共产主义胜利的事情，都是道德的；任何妨碍社会主义和共产主义胜利的事情，都是不道德的。而凡是能够为建设社会主义社会、争取共产主义胜利献出自己全部力量和精力的人，也就是道德最高尚的人。
    从这一精神出发，列宁指出，必须使青年形成这样的道德品质，如热爱社会主义祖国，共产主义劳动态度和对公共财物的共产主义态度，高度的纪律性，集体主义精神，诚实和正直，布尔什维克的谦逊和原则性等。这也就具体地规定了共产主义道德教育的基本内容。在说到共产主义道德的时候，我们还不能不想到，伟大列宁的生平活动，就是共产主义道德的最高典范。正如在列宁逝世的时候，布尔什维克党中央委员会的公告中所指出的：
  “无产阶级伟大解放运动的历史，在马克思以后，还没有产生过像我们的已故领袖、导师和朋友这样伟大的人物。真正伟大而英勇的无产阶级所具有的一切——大无畏的精神，钢铁般的、不屈不挠的、攻无不克的、坚决的意志，对于奴役和压迫制度所怀抱的不共戴天的神圣恨心，挟山超海的革命热忱，对于群众创造力量的无限确信，巨大的组织天才——这一切都在列宁身上找到壮丽的体现。列宁的名字成为从西到东、从南到北的新世界的象征。”按照列宁的榜样来生活、工作和斗争，我们就能最好地养成共产主义道德的品质。
    伟大的列宁不仅为我们指出了共产主义教育的任务和内容，他还深刻地为我们指出了共产主义教育的基本方法，告诉青年们如何去学习共产主义。列宁反复地强调必须反对理论同实践脱离的那种教育，因为这种教育只会使共产主义遭到莫大的损害。他说，没有工作，没有斗争，那末单从共产主义小册子和著作中求得的书本上的共产主义知识，可以说是一文钱不值。这种教育只会造就出一些共产主义的书呆子或吹牛家。既然教育青年是为了使他们能够去建设新的社会，那末就应该使教育青年的每一步骤，同巩固完成社会主义事业的实际斗争密切联系起来。
    怎样才能把青年的教育同建设新社会的斗争密切联系起来呢？
    列宁指出，在过渡时期中，阶级斗争还在继续着，只不过改变了自己的形式。无产阶级同资产阶级之间还存在着尖锐的斗争。列宁还指出了在资本主义包围形势下，工人阶级共和国还要随时警惕遭受新的进攻的危险。因此，教育青年首先必须同阶级斗争联系起来，并且服从于这个斗争。列宁明确地说：“青年们只有把自己学习、教育与训练中的每一步骤同无产者劳动者反对旧的剥削者社会所不断进行的斗争联系起来，才能学习共产主义。”列宁的这一遗训，对于我们今天说来有着特别重要的意义。我们党的七届四中全会告诉我们：为要把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家的社会主义革命，是一个比反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的革命更深刻更广泛的革命，包含着极复杂极尖锐的斗争。在这场斗争中，一方面，外国帝国主义决不会袖手旁观；另一方面，国内那些已经被打倒的阶级决不会甘心于自己的死亡，那些将被消灭的阶级也决不会没有反抗，他们中的坚决反革命分子必然要同外国帝国主义互相勾结起来，利用每一个机会来破坏我们党和人民的事业，企图使中国革命事业归于失败，使反动统治在中国复辟。因此我们对青年的共产主义教育，就必须同反对国内外阶级敌人的斗争紧密联系起来。
    这就要求我们必须教育青年时刻保持革命的警惕性，扫除那些以为现在“一切都很好了”“一切都太平无事了”的麻痹思想。要教育青年把依法服兵役看成是自己神圣的义务，英勇地保卫自己的祖国；要教育青年仇恨一切阴谋破坏祖国社会主义建设和社会主义改造的反革命分子和存心不良的分子，并且坚决跟他们作斗争。
    同时，这还要求我们对资本主义思想侵蚀青年的现象，作坚决的、不断的斗争。在旧社会里，人们养成了“我的目的只在谋利，其他一切与我无关”的根深蒂固的心理和习惯。要改变这种心理和习惯，需要一个很长的时期。而我们又是在还没摆脱资本主义影响的人民群众中培养新人，正如列宁所说，他们还染有“天生的资本主义污点”。特别是我国目前还存在着资产阶级，他们不仅以其丑恶的思想，而且还以其腐朽的生活方式，侵蚀着青年。在最近所进行的道德教育中，大家已经揭发了许多令人惊心的例子，证明资产阶级的生活方式和享乐至上的思想，对我们青年有多么大的危害。随着过渡时期阶级斗争的尖锐化，反映在思想上的斗争也必将更加尖锐。列宁说：“我们的任务就是战胜资本家的反抗，不仅是军事上和政治上的反抗，而且是思想上最深刻和最强大的反抗。”联共（布）中央在一九三一年关于小学和中学的决议中，也曾强调指出：“在社会主义时期，当无产阶级正在尖锐的阶级斗争条件下彻底消灭阶级的时候，苏联学校中的彻底的共产主义教育，以及加紧斗争，反对向苏维埃学校的儿童灌输非无产阶级思想意识的一切企图，是具有非常重要意义的。”必须同资产阶级思想作不断的斗争，才能使青年受到真正的共产主义的教育。
    把教育青年同建设新社会的斗争联系起来的另一个意义，就是要引导青年自觉地积极地去参加公共劳动，树立新的劳动态度。新的劳动态度是提高劳动生产率的必要条件；为高度的劳动生产率而斗争，也就是为共产主义而斗争。列宁教导说，必须使大家都看到，青年团员个个都是有知识，同时又都是善于劳动的。他又说：“做一个青年团员，就是要把自己的工作和能力用去为公共事业服务。这就是共产主义教育的实质。只有在这样的工作过程中，青年男女才能培养成为真正的共产主义者。只有当他们能在这种工作中收到实际效果时，他们才会变成为共产主义者。”这就是说，真正的共产主义意识，只有在为公共的忘我的劳动中才能产生；旧社会带来的利己主义的种种心理和习惯，也只有在为公共的忘我劳动中，才能逐渐克服和清除。同时也只有在这种劳动中，青年们才能同工农打成一片；而能否同工农群众相结合，对于青年，正如毛泽东同志所说，是革命不革命的标准。列宁要求必须使青年团在自觉的有纪律的劳动中，教育所有一切从十二岁起的青年；要求青年团应当是在一切工作中都能出力帮助，都表现出主动精神和首创精神的突击队。这种日常劳动的教育，也就是最重要的共产主义教育。我们应教育每一个青年要坚忍不拔地去完成国家交给的任何任务；教育青年工人为人民生产更多更好的产品；教育青年农民走合作化的道路，多打粮食支援国家建设。此外，经常组织青年参加各种有利于公共事业的义务劳动，是具有特别深刻教育意义的事情。这种义务劳动，还有利于我们去克服在胜利发展条件下青年中娇生惯养的习气。
    对青年的共产主义教育，是我们整个党和全社会的责任。但是作为党的助手和后备军的青年团，却担负着特殊重要和光荣的任务。斯大林按照列宁的精神，曾对青年团下过一个经典性的定义：“这是工农青年的群众组织，是非党的组织，但它是很靠近党的。”所谓“群众组织”，就是说它不是一个关门的、狭隘的小团体，而是应该积极地以自己多种多样的政治工作和组织工作，去影响最广泛的、各阶层的、不同水平的青年群众。要像列宁所说的那样：“青年团应当成为这样一个团体，使得任何工人都感觉到，这团体中的人们的学说，也许还是他所不懂得的，也许他还不会一下子就相信，但从他们的实际工作和活动上，他却看出他们是真正能向他指明正确道路的人。”所谓“很靠近党”，就是他是无限忠诚于党的思想，能够真正以共产主义的精神去教育青年一代。青年团应该以实际工作来证明，自己正是伟大列宁所教导的那样的青年团。
    中国新民主主义青年团，遵循着列宁的教导，并且以用伟大列宁命名的光荣的苏联共产主义青年团作为自己的学习榜样，不断改正自己的缺点，不断前进着。在我们亲爱的党和伟大领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，中国青年将更勇敢地高举起列宁的光辉的旗帜，为在中国彻底实现社会主义伟大事业而奋斗。
