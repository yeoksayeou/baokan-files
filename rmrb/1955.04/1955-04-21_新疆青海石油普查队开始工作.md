    Xinjiang Qinghai Petroleum Survey Team Begins Work
    The three petroleum survey brigades of the Northwest Geological Bureau, which have arrived in Xinjiang, Qinghai, and other places, have now begun work. In Xinjiang, geologists in the Turpan and Junggar Basins have conducted reconnaissance surveys, and in Qinghai, geologists in the Qaidam Basin are familiarizing themselves with geological profile data. These three teams will officially begin exploration work in early May to find possible oil-bearing geological structures, oil shale, coal, and barite resources for use in drilling mud when drilling oil wells this year.
    These three survey brigades include more than twenty specialized geological teams for surveying, geodetic surveying, shallow drilling, and geophysical prospecting, as well as more than thirty groups for astronomical points, topographic surveying, and other tasks. They are responsible for a large amount of work this year. The survey brigade working in the Qaidam Basin will conduct a survey around the basin and cross the basin three times.

    新疆青海石油普查队开始工作
    到达新疆、青海等地的西北地质局三个石油普查大队现已开始工作。在新疆吐鲁番和准噶尔盆地的地质人员已进行踏勘，在青海柴达木盆地的地质人员正熟悉地质剖面资料。这三个队在五月初就要正式做勘查工作，以便在今年寻找可能储油的地质构造、油母页岩、煤和供钻凿石油井时放在泥浆中应用的重晶石等资源。
    这三个普查大队包括了普查、大地测量、浅钻、物探等二十几个专业地质小队以及做天文点、地形测量等工作的三十几个小组。他们今年担负的工作量很大，在柴达木盆地工作的普查大队，就要围绕盆地普查一圈，还要三次横穿盆地。 （新华社）
