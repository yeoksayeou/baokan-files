Cannot Be Indifferent to Farmers Selling Draught Animals
    Zhang Lianbi

    To understand the problem of farmers selling large numbers of livestock, I conducted a survey in Wanghuitun, Minzhong Village, 14th District, Keshan County. The farmers in this village said, "From the autumn of 1954 to now, the number of livestock in this village has decreased a lot due to death and sales!" Village cadres also said, "If the government issues certificates, the livestock in this village will be sold out!" District Chief Wang Zhanping said, "In the spring of 1954, the county allocated funds to our district to buy draught animals, but we couldn't buy them locally. We had no choice but to buy them in the Qiqihar area. However, this spring is very different. There are many selling livestock, but no one is buying." The facts are indeed like this. From the autumn of 1954 to March 5th this year, 30 households in this village (accounting for 22.9% of the total number of households) sold livestock, a total of 36 animals (18 horses, 18 cattle). Only eight of them were unusable; the vast majority were draught animals. The number sold accounted for 22% of the total number of existing livestock. There are currently 14 households eager to sell (referring to those who have had quarrels or repeatedly requested certificates due to the government's refusal to issue certificates; those generally waiting to sell are not included in the calculation). From the summer of 1954 to now, only six households have bought seven livestock, mostly selling good ones and buying inferior ones, and some have sold them again after buying them.

    Why is this happening? From what I have learned, the main reason is that farmers lack a correct understanding of the agricultural collectivization movement. Some farmers believe that "you can join the cooperative even without a horse"; "sell the livestock and then join the cooperative, so you will have more money in hand and less investment in fodder." Farmer Li Jingxin plans: "Sell the horse in the fall and then join the cooperative, so I will have more money in hand." Some wealthy farmers are afraid that horses will be "nationalized," especially afraid of the "more refund, less compensation" method of "nationalization." They are afraid that poor households will not be able to afford to compensate, "maybe it will never be compensated." Therefore, they believe that "it is better to sell the livestock now to improve living standards." The wealthy household Ren Shoutian sold a yellow draft horse for 350 yuan in the winter of 1954 and withdrew 100 yuan from the credit cooperative. His family was already well-off and did not need the money. The two brothers lay on the heated brick bed worrying about how to spend the money. After thinking about it, they spent 50 yuan to buy a gramophone, 280 yuan to buy a sewing machine, and 50 yuan to buy a leather coat to store (his family already had two leather coats and one cotton coat).

    It is particularly noteworthy that some party members and cadres also have the idea that "you can join the cooperative even without livestock." They take the lead in selling livestock, which also has a certain impact on farmers. Village Chief Song Lu (a party member) had four cattle in the winter of 1953, but now they have all been sold; the director of the "Happiness" agricultural production cooperative sold two of his four horses. Some farmers, seeing this, also wanted to sell their horses, and some even had quarrels with village cadres. They said: You live better than us and can sell horses, why can't we sell horses?

    The large-scale sale of livestock by farmers is also due to certain deviations in the implementation of collectivization policies in this village. First, the two cooperatives in this village improperly adopted the "equal shareholding" investment method in 1954, and some households sold livestock because they could not afford to invest. Second, in 1954, the agricultural production cooperative mistakenly proposed "no old or weak horses," and coupled with the high cost of fodder, some farmers had no choice but to sell their livestock. These farmers did not want to sell their draught animals; they said, "People who join the cooperative get dividends with both people and horses, but we only get dividends for the person when we join the cooperative." Therefore, some farmers said with dissatisfaction: "Our livestock can still work in the mutual aid team, why can't they work in the cooperative?" Third, the issue of young livestock was not handled appropriately in a timely manner. The cooperative did not want them, and it was inconvenient for farmers to manage them themselves after joining the cooperative, so they had to sell them.

    High-interest loan activities are relatively serious, and some farmers owe debts to high-interest lenders, which is also a reason for selling livestock. For example, Yang Jinshan borrowed 90 yuan from Lao Leitou in 1953 at a five-point interest rate. By the end of 1953, the principal and interest were 135 yuan, and in 1954, the principal and interest rolled to 202 yuan. Yang Jinshan sold a horse in 1954 and repaid him 200 yuan of debt.

    Due to the large-scale sale of livestock by farmers and the small number of people buying livestock, the price of livestock has fallen sharply. According to information from the Beixing Town market, the price of horses has decreased by about 45% compared to the same period last year, and the price of cows has decreased by about 30% (bulls have a certain listed price due to state purchases, so there is no major change). For example, Jia Kui's five-year-old mare was worth 330 yuan last spring, but was sold for 180 yuan this year. Jia Yunsheng's blind horse was bought for 150 yuan last year, but now he is willing to sell it for 80 yuan. Wang Mujian bought a large cow for 80 yuan last year, but it is only worth 50 yuan this year. In this way, farmers' enthusiasm for raising livestock is even lower. The ensuing result is a very serious phenomenon of livestock death. From the summer of 1954 to now, this village has lost six horses and twelve cattle (there was some bovine plague last year, but this is related to carelessness). The dead accounted for a little over 11% of the existing livestock.

    From the summer of 1954 to now, a total of 54 livestock have died or been sold, accounting for 33.12% of the total number of existing livestock. Compared with the same period last year (the number of livestock in the same period last year was calculated by adding the current number of 163, the number sold 36, and the number of deaths 18, totaling 217; the livestock of the seven households that moved away last winter and this spring were not included), the total number of livestock has decreased by 24.9%.

    Currently, this village, especially the two agricultural production cooperatives, deeply feels the shortage of animal power. Among the 99 households in the two agricultural production cooperatives, 46 households (accounting for 46.4% of the total number of households joining the cooperatives) do not have draught animals (excluding young livestock that have not joined the cooperatives); the other 53 households have only 63 draught animals (53 horses, 10 cattle), and the quality is very poor. These two cooperatives have more than 480 hectares of land, averaging more than 7 hectares of land to be cultivated per livestock. It can be seen that the large-scale sale of livestock and the increase in livestock mortality cannot but directly affect the improvement of agricultural production and the consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives.

    However, the leading cadres of the district and village are indifferent to this issue. Some village cadres say: Most farmers have joined the cooperatives this year, and these livestock are not needed! Some village cadres say: Now that they are sold, there won't be enough! Some village cadres say: In fact, those livestock were not enough for plowing, hauling, and threshing in the fall. But when selling livestock, no one persuades them. The village cadres asked the district for instructions, and the comrades in the district said: The surplus can be sold, but not the small amount. But the district did not give specific instructions on how to deal with it. Now some farmers are still clamoring to sell livestock.

    Can such an indifferent attitude be adopted towards such a problem? Absolutely not. Is this problem really unsolvable? Absolutely not. Although the number of livestock has increased somewhat in recent years, the contradiction of insufficient livestock will become more obvious and prominent as agricultural production cooperatives develop and expand and new types of animal-powered agricultural implements increase year by year. Although the efficiency of livestock use in agricultural production cooperatives has improved somewhat, it is not compatible with the great development of agricultural production, the promotion of new animal-powered agricultural implements, and the requirements of expanded reproduction, both in terms of quantity and quality. If we do not pay attention to solving this contradiction, it will affect the smooth progress of the agricultural collectivization movement. Livestock is not only the main driving force of agricultural production at present, but also for a considerable period of time to come. The idea that "there will be a surplus of livestock after the establishment of the cooperative" is extremely harmful. The development of agricultural production cooperatives marks a major change in rural relations of production from individual economy to cooperative economy. In such a change, we must constantly pay attention to studying the ideological changes of farmers in managing and raising livestock, and conduct in-depth education to farmers in light of these ideas, in order to dispel unnecessary concerns and misunderstandings. It is necessary to explain to them that doing a good job in the collective production of the cooperative is one of the long-term and greatest interests of the farmers, and also to explain to them the principle that it is not a loss to have livestock rented or converted to the cooperative at a discounted price, so as to overcome the selfish idea of "joining the cooperative even without a horse." It is necessary to dissuade farmers, especially rural party members and cadres, from arbitrarily selling draught animals. At the same time, it is necessary to pay attention to solving various specific policy issues such as livestock joining the cooperative in a steady manner. On the one hand, poor farmers should not be excluded in various forms, and on the other hand, middle peasants should not suffer losses. The methods of not wanting plowing cattle and weak horses and equal investment are manifestations of excluding poor farmers. Because most of those who have plowing cattle and weak horses are poor farmers, and poor farmers who cannot afford to invest will have to bear debts and sell livestock. In addition, various methods should be adopted to encourage farmers to invest in agricultural production cooperatives; the price and interest must be reasonable for private livestock that is publicly used by the cooperative and converted at a discounted price; the cooperatives in the initial stage of operation do not have to rush to implement the method of converting at a discounted price; when there are conditions and everyone agrees to convert at a discounted price, the price should also be fair and reasonable, and the repayment period should not be too long. Appropriate arrangements should be made for how to rationally utilize old and weak livestock, how to solve the problem of breeding young livestock from female livestock, and how to feed and manage young livestock.

    不能对农民出卖耕畜的事漠不关心
    张连璧
    为了了解农民大量出卖牲畜的问题，我在克山县十四区民众村王会屯作了一次调查。这个屯的农民说：“从一九五四年秋天到现在，这个屯子的牲畜连死带卖，少了很多啦！”村干部也说：“如果政府给开证明文件的话，这屯的牲畜得卖光！”区长王占平说：“一九五四年春天，县里拨款给我们区里买耕畜，在当地怎么也买不到；无法才到齐齐哈尔一带把耕畜买了回来。可是，今年春天就大不相同，卖牲畜的很多，却没人买。”事实确是如此。从一九五四年入秋到今年三月五日，这个屯共有三十户（占总户数百分之二十二点九）卖牲畜的，共卖出三十六头（马十八、牛十八），其中不能使的只有八头，绝大部分是耕畜。卖出的占现有牲畜总数的百分之二十二。现在急于出卖的还有十四户（指因政府不给开证明文件而发生口角的或屡次要求开证明文件的而言，一般等着出卖的还未计算在内）。从一九五四年夏天到现在，只有六户买进七头牲口，多是卖好的买次的，其中有的买来以后又卖掉了。
    为什么会发生这种现象呢？就我了解到的情况看来，主要原因是农民对于农业合作化运动缺乏正确的认识。有些农民认为“没马一样入社”；“卖了牲口再入社，手头既充裕，又可少投入草料”。农民李景新计划：“到秋天把马一卖然后入社，闹个手头充裕。”还有些富裕农民怕马“归公”，特别是怕采用多退少补的办法“归公”，他们怕贫困户补不起，“说不定什么时候才补给”。因此，他们认为“不如现在卖了牲口改善生活”。富裕户任守田，一九五四年冬卖了黄辕马得了三百五十元，又把信用合作社存款取出一百元。他家生活本来很充裕，用不着这钱，他们哥俩躺在炕上愁着这个钱没法花，想来想去，就用五十元买了个留声机，用二百八十元买了一台缝纫机，用五十元买了一身皮大衣存着（他家本来已经有两件皮大衣，一件棉大衣）。
    值得特别注意的是：有些党员干部同样有“没牲口一样入社”的思想，他们带头出卖牲畜，这对农民也有一定影响。村长宋禄（党员）一九五三年冬有四头牛，现在全部卖光；“幸福”农业生产合作社主任四匹马卖了两匹。有些农民一看，就也要把马卖掉，有些人还和村干部吵了架。他们说：你们比我们生活好还能卖马，我们卖马为什么不行？
    农民大批出卖牲畜，也因为这个屯在贯彻合作化政策方面有某些偏差。第一，这屯的两个合作社一九五四年都不适当地采取了“平均入股”的投资办法，有些户因无力投资而卖牲口。第二，一九五四年农业生产合作社错误地提出“不要老牛弱马”，加上草料贵，有些农民无法，只好把牲畜卖掉。这些农民本不想把耕畜卖掉；他们说：“人家入社连人带马一齐分红，咱入社就是一个人分红。”因此，有些农民不满地说：“我们那牲口在互助组一样种地，到合作社为什么就不行了呢？”第三，幼畜问题未能及时地进行适当的处理，社里不要，农民入社后自己经营不便，只好出卖。
    高利贷活动比较严重，有些农民欠着高利贷主的债务，也是出卖牲畜的一个原因。例如杨金山一九五三年借老雷头九十元，五分利，一九五三年底本利是一百三十五元，一九五四年本利滚到二百零二元；杨金山一九五四年卖马还了他二百元的债务。
    由于农民大量出卖牲畜，买牲畜的很少，就使牲畜的价格大为跌落。据在北兴镇市场了解，马匹价格同去年同时期比较，降低百分之四十五左右，母牛价格降低百分之三十左右（公牛因国家收购，有一定牌价，无大变化）。例如贾奎的五岁大骒马，去春值三百三十元，今年一百八十元就卖了。贾云升的瞎儿马是去年花一百五十元买的，现在给八十元就要卖，王木匠去年花八十元买一头大母牛，今年只能值五十元。这样，农民饲养牲畜的积极性就更不高了。随之而来的就是牲畜死亡现象十分严重。一九五四年夏天到现在，这个屯共死六匹马、十二头牛（去年有些牛瘟，但这同不经心有关）。死去的占现有牲畜百分之十一强。
    从一九五四年夏天到现在，死亡和出卖的牲口共五十四头，占现有牲畜总数的百分之三十三点一二。同去年同时期比较（去年同时期牲畜数是把现有数一百六十三和出卖数三十六以及死亡数十八相加而来的，计为二百十七头；去冬和今春搬走七户的牲畜没有计算在内），牲畜的总数减少了百分之二十四点九。
    目前，这个屯子，特别是两个农业生产合作社，深深感到畜力的不足。两个农业生产合作社九十九户中，就有四十六户（占入社总户数百分之四十六点四）没有耕畜（其中有未入社的幼畜没有计算在内）；另外的五十三户，仅有耕畜六十三头（马五十三匹，牛十头），而且质量很不好。这两个社共有土地四百八十多垧，平均每个牲畜要耕地七垧多。由此可见，大量出卖牲畜和牲畜死亡率的增加，不能不直接影响农业生产的提高和农业生产合作社的巩固。
    然而，区村领导干部对于这个问题却是漠不关心的。有的村干部说：今年大部分农民都参加了合作社，用不了这些牲口啦！有的村干部说：现在这一卖，就不够用啦！还有的村干部说：其实，原先那些牲口，一到秋天，翻地、拉地、打场也是不够用。可是卖牲口的时候，谁也不去说服，村干部请示区里，区里的同志说：多余的可以卖，不多的不要卖。但究竟如何处理，区里也没有具体指示。现在有的农民还吵着要卖牲口。
    对于这样的问题，能够采取这样淡漠的态度吗？千万不能。这个问题真的是没法解决的吗？决不是这样的。尽管近年来牲畜头数有些增加，但由于今后农业生产合作社日益发展扩大，新式畜力农具逐年增多，牲畜不足的矛盾就会更加明显和突出。目前虽然农业生产合作社的牲畜使用效率有些提高，但无论从数量上和质量上看，都是同农业生产合作的大发展、新式畜力农具的推广和扩大再生产的要求不相适应的。如果不注意解决这个矛盾，就会影响农业生产合作化运动的顺利前进。牲畜不仅在目前而且在今后相当长的时期以内还是农业生产的主要动力。那种“合作社成立，牲口就有余”的思想是极其有害的。农业生产合作社的发展，标志着农村生产关系由个体经济逐渐向合作经济的重大变革。在这样的变革中，我们必须不断注意研究农民在经营饲养牲畜方面的思想变化，针对这些思想深入地向农民进行教育，以解除不必要的顾虑和误解。要向他们说明搞好合作社的集体生产是农民的长远的最大的利益之一，也要向他们说明牲畜归社里租用或者折价归社原主并不吃亏的道理，克服“没马一样入社”的那种自私自利的思想。必须劝阻农民特别是农村党员、干部任意出卖耕畜的行为。同时，必须注意稳妥地解决牲畜入社等各项具体政策问题。一方面不能用种种形式排斥贫农，另方面也不能使中农吃亏。不要耕牛、弱马和平均投资的办法，都是排斥贫农的表现。因为有耕牛和弱马的多是贫农，贫农投资投不起就要背债和出卖牲畜。另外，应采用各种办法鼓励农民向农业生产合作社投资；私有牲畜归社公用折价付息的，价格和利息必须合理；初办的社，不必急于实行折价归公的办法；有条件和大家同意折价归公的时候，价格也要公平合理，归还价款期限不可过长。对于老弱牲畜如何合理利用，母畜繁殖幼畜问题如何解决，幼畜如何饲养管理，都应当做适当的安排。
