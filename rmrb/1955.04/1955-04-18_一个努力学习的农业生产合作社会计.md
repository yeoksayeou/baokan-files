    An Agricultural Production Cooperative Accountant Who Works Hard to Learn
    By our reporter Li Gendi
    Gai Jizhong is the accountant of the Xiwangmang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province. He has been an accountant for a year now. Last year he was the accountant of the Second Agricultural Production Cooperative of Xiwangmang Village; this year, the four small cooperatives in the village merged into the Xiwangmang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative, and he was again elected as the accountant, managing the finances of the large cooperative with 170 members.
    After liberation, Gai Jizhong managed the village's public accounts and also the work accounts of the mutual aid team. He is patient and careful, and his accounting is error-free. But in the past, those accounts were mostly running accounts, which were relatively simple, but now the accounts of the agricultural cooperative are very different. The agricultural cooperative's accounts include public funds, private investment, agricultural and sideline income and expenditure, labor work accounts, and reserve funds, public welfare funds, and other items. An incorrect calculation of an account would not only affect the unity of the members, but also affect the consolidation of the agricultural cooperative. For Gai Jizhong, the accounting work of the agricultural cooperative was simply a heavy burden. How did he take on this burden? The members and he himself talked a lot, but in general, there are two main points: the determination to learn new accounting methods; and constantly absorbing mass opinions and correcting shortcomings.
    When the Second Agricultural Production Cooperative of Xiwangmang Village was first established, the higher authorities sent cadres to help the new cooperative accountants in Wangmang Village and nearby villages to learn bookkeeping. At that time, the four accountants from the four agricultural cooperatives in the village were asked to first calculate the accounting accounts of the First Agricultural Cooperative together. The four people calculated for eight days, using the abacus until midnight every day. As a result, the accounts were calculated, but it was still unclear what the relationship between these numbers was. Everyone was very distressed and felt that the accounting work of the agricultural cooperative was difficult to do. The superior cadre asked, "Do you think the old accounts are good, or the new accounts are good?" No one had seen the new accounts, and they all agreed to "give it a try." But after listening to the cadre for a long time, it seemed like a mess was being stuffed into their hearts. Some said, "The more I learn, the more confused I get." Some said, "I can't write foreign numerals." Gai Jizhong felt dizzy seeing all the "circles." Accountant Bai Zhenyi insisted, "The new accounts can't be learned." After the cadre patiently persuaded them, they started learning again. Gradually, he began to understand what "credit" and "debit" meant, and the accountant's role as an intermediary in the accounting process, and other simple accounting principles. But when they then learned about terms such as "assets" and "liabilities," everyone fell into a blind alley again. In short, there were many difficulties in learning the "new accounts." When he ran into snags, Gai Jizhong frowned, didn't want to eat, and his eyes turned red. If he didn't learn, the old accounts would follow one after another, drawn on hemp paper ledgers, and it would be impossible to figure out who was related to whom. In the end it would be a mess, and how would the accounts be settled in the future? How would the distribution be done? If he continued to learn, it was difficult either way. Later, he thought: not learning is not an option, unless I don't be an accountant. But being an accountant was what everyone had chosen, and everyone was enthusiastic about taking the socialist road and living a good life. It wouldn't work without someone managing the accounts. Moreover, hadn't he repeatedly said that he was willing to take the socialist road? How could he not learn the knowledge of managing socialist property? Just as he was in this dilemma, he recalled a period of his life when he was an accountant.
      When he was in Fengyu Mountain managing sideline accounts, he slept in an ancient temple at night, and wolves howled everywhere. During the day, it rained continuously, and he often couldn't get food, sometimes hungry, sometimes full, but he persevered to the end. That year, the brooms produced were sold for more than 1,800 yuan, overcoming the production and living difficulties of most of the masses. Because the accounts were clear, no one had any objections during the distribution of dividends. At that time, how grateful everyone was to him! Thinking about it, he felt a great sense of happiness. This memory encouraged Gai Jizhong. He felt that he had strength, and he immediately busily cut more than 30 pieces of hemp paper, and used a meter ruler and a fountain pen to draw various new-style ledgers, and began to transfer the old accounts to them one by one. When he encountered difficulties, he would ask people, and he wasn't so afraid anymore. Once, he wrote the account of buying door curtains for sideline occupations in the agricultural account. After someone pointed it out, he immediately understood this principle: the sideline account is a purely labor income and expenditure, and cannot be mixed with the agricultural account, because the agricultural account includes not only labor income and expenditure, but also land share income and expenditure. If the two are confused, the accounts cannot be cleared. After he summarized the items on the classified accounts one by one, calculated their different quantities, and saw the complex economic relationships in the agricultural cooperative from them, he initially mastered the management methods of the new accounting accounts. When he turned the accounts that he previously thought were chaotic into a clear account statement with the help of superior cadres, he happily said: "The new accounts are really good, simple, clear, and time-saving. I have finally grasped this great knowledge." Indeed, Gai Jizhong finally grasped the key to managing accounting accounts through hard and serious study.
    Learning accounting technology is not enough to be a good accountant in an agricultural cooperative. To be a good accountant, you also need to do many other things well. Sometimes in places you think are unimportant, unexpected problems often occur. Because Gai Jizhong was enthusiastic about studying accounting business, he went to Xi'an to study again. In addition, he was busy with the work of the accounting mutual aid group, so the accounts were delayed from June to August before they were announced. At that time, he felt that since the accounts were correct anyway, a few days' delay wouldn't matter much. Unexpectedly, as soon as the accounts were announced, many people stared blankly with a head full of doubts. Some people looked at the accounts and said, "What's going on? I only did so much work all summer, I'm afraid it's not right?" Cooperative member Gai Shengjun was shocked to hear that he had only done twenty-three work days. He stuck out his tongue and said, "Heavens, I've been busy since summer and only did this much work!" At this time, Gai Jizhong was standing next to him and asked him:
  "Is the account wrong?" He said it was not wrong, and hurriedly ran to the group leader and greeted him, "Group leader, quickly find me something to do if there is any work." The two production groups also selected two representatives to check the accounts. Although the results of the account check proved that the accounts were not recorded incorrectly, he really felt that he had become a sinner when he saw this situation. He said: "Look, delaying the announcement of the accounts for a few days has made everyone so uneasy. If I had announced the accounts earlier, the members would have had a bottom line in their hearts, and those who did less work would have become active earlier." Since then, he knew that he must settle the accounts of the agricultural cooperative on time; timely announcement of the accounts can not only improve the production enthusiasm of all members, but also facilitate everyone to jointly care about the economic situation within the cooperative. Soon, the preliminary distribution plan for the autumn harvest was completed, and Gai Jizhong announced the distribution account list according to the decision of the cooperative's management committee. He posted the account list, which was written in detail on large red paper, on the wall of the feeding room, and stood in the crowd to listen to opinions. Literate people read it out, and illiterate people squeezed in to inquire about how their accounts were settled. He heard many people murmuring: "We only know what we got from labor, what we got from manure and seeds, but the total income and total expenditure of the cooperative are unknown." He thought: "That's right! If everyone doesn't understand the overall situation of the cooperative, their minds won't be clear." At this time, the cooperative's management committee, based on the opinions of the masses, decided to give a detailed oral report on all the accounts at the meeting, not only to let the members know the "big picture" and "small details," but also to let everyone know why it should be calculated this way. At the same time, it was also announced that anyone with doubts could individually reconcile their accounts. Gai Jizhong patiently improved his work according to the decision of the cooperative committee. Whenever there were people reconciling accounts, he carefully calculated and reconciled with them in detail. As a result, the members were very satisfied with the agricultural cooperative's accounts. Gai Shengxue received less points, but he was convinced after calculating the accounts. He said to others: "It's not that we didn't get more points, it's that we didn't do enough work. The cooperative is the same as doing this little work in our own home, I'm afraid we wouldn't get that much." Some people said: "Anyway, this year has passed, let's see my labor next year." In short, after listening to the distribution accounts, everyone had a further understanding of the cooperative, and labor enthusiasm was further improved.
    Gai Jizhong constantly absorbed mass opinions and constantly improved his accounting work in this way.
    In January of this year, Chang'an County transferred all the accountants of the agricultural cooperatives to Wangmang Village for training after the establishment of the first phase of agricultural cooperatives. Many accountants from the new cooperatives went to Jizhong's home to ask this and that whenever they had time. Jizhong often said to them: Being a good accountant is a very important thing, but first you have to be determined to learn the new accounts; secondly, you must not be afraid of running into snags, and listen to the opinions of the members. If you can be a good accountant, I guarantee that you will become more and more interested in doing it, because if you manage the accounts well, you can personally see how much encouragement it can give to the members.

    一个努力学习的农业生产合作社会计
    本报记者　李根蒂
    盖冀忠是陕西省长安县西王莽村农业生产合作社的会计。他当会计已经一年了。去年他是西王莽村第二农业生产合作社的会计；今年村内四个小社合并为西王莽村农业生产合作社，他又被选为会计，管理着有一百七十户社员的大社的财务。
    解放后，盖冀忠管过村里的公账，还管过互助组的工账。他耐心、细心，管账不出差错。但过去那些账大部是流水账，比较简单些，现在农业社的账就大不相同了。农业社的账有公款、有私人投资，有农业、副业收支，有劳动工账，还有公积金、公益金等项目。算错一笔账，不仅会影响社员的团结，而且会影响到农业社的巩固。农业社的会计工作对盖冀忠来说，简直是一付沉重的担子。他是怎样担承起这付担子来的？社员和他本人都谈了很多，总的说来，主要有两点：就是下决心学习新账；不断吸收群众意见和改正缺点。
    西王莽村第二农业生产合作社初成立时，上级派干部来帮助王莽村和附近村的新社会计学记账。当时，让村内四个农业社的四个会计一起先计算第一农业社的会计账目，四个人计算了八天，每天算盘子打到半夜，结果账算出来了，却还是不明白这些数目互相有些什么关系。大家很苦闷，觉得农业社会计这工作难做。上级干部问：“你们看旧账好，还是新账好？”谁也没见过新账，都同意“试一试”。但听干部讲了半天，却好像乱麻往心中塞。有的说：“越学越糊涂。”有的说：“洋码字写不来。”盖冀忠见尽是“圈圈子”，头都大了。会计白振义坚持说：“新账学不成。”经过干部耐心说服，才又学习起来。慢慢地，他开始懂得了什么叫“收方”，什么叫“付方”，和会计在记账过程中是中介人的关系等简单会计原理。但接着学到“资产”“负债”等名词时，大家又掉进闷葫芦里了。总之，学习“新账”的困难是很多的。碰上钉子了，盖冀忠锁起了眉头，饭也不想吃，眼珠都熬红了。不学吧，旧账一笔跟一笔，顺着划在麻纸账本上，究竟谁和谁有啥关系，就没法弄清，算来算去仍是一窝浆子，将来怎么结账法？怎么分配法？学下去吧，又左也难右也难。后来他想：不学不是办法，除过不当会计。可是当会计是大家选上的，大家热心要走社会主义道路，过好日月，没有管账的也不行。而且，自己不是口口声声说愿意走社会主义道路吗？不愿意学管理社会主义财产的学问哪能行呢？正在这进退两难的时候，他回忆起过去当会计的一段生活来。
      他在丰裕山管副业账的时候，夜里睡在古祠里，恶狼到处乱吼，白天连续天雨，常常吃不上饭，饥一顿，饱一顿，但到底坚持下来了。那一年生产的扫帚卖了一千八百多元，克服了大部群众生产、生活的困难。因为账目清楚，分红时，大家都没有意见，那时，大家是多么感激他呀！想着想着，他感到了一种很大的快乐。这一段回忆鼓舞了盖冀忠。他觉着自己有了力量了，他立即忙忙碌碌地裁好了三十多张麻纸，用米达尺和水笔照样划着各类新式账簿，开始一宗一宗地把旧账往上边过。过着过着难住了，他就去问人，也不那样害怕了。有一次，他把副业上买门帘的账写在农业上，经别人指出后，他马上想通了这样一个道理：副业账是纯劳力的收支，不能和农业账混在一起，因为农业账上不仅有劳力的收支，还包括土地股份的收支，把两者混淆了，账就算不清楚了。当他把分类账上的科目一项项地加以总结，算出它们不同的数量，从里面看出农业社中复杂的经济关系以后，他就初步掌握了新式会计账目的管理方法。当他在上级干部帮助下，把以前认为千头万绪的账目弄成一目了然的账单后，他高兴地说：“新账到底好呵，简单，明白，省事，这门大学问到底抓住了。”的确，盖冀忠经过艰苦认真的学习，终于掌握住管理会计账目的钥匙了。
    学会了会计技术，在农业社中还不能当一名好会计。当一名好会计，还需要作好其他许多事情。有时在你以为不重要的地方，往往会发生了你想不到的问题。盖冀忠因为热心钻研会计业务，又去西安学习了一趟，加上忙于会计互助组的工作，把账一直由六月拖到八月才公布。当时自己觉得反正账没错，迟几天关系不大，想不到账刚公布，好些人眼瞪眼，一脑子的疑惑。有的人看了账说：“怎么搞的，一整夏天我才做了那一些工，恐怕不对吧？”社员盖生俊听见自己只做了二十三个工，大吃一惊，吐着舌头说：“天哪，我自夏忙到如今只做了这点工！”这时，盖冀忠正站在他旁边，问他：
  “账错啦？”他说没错，便匆匆忙忙跑到组长跟前招呼说：“组长，有啥活了赶快给我找下做。”两个生产组也选出两个代表来查账。虽然账查的结果证明账没记错，但他看到了这种情况，真感到自己成了罪人。他说：“你瞧，迟公布了几天账，惹得大伙那末不安心。假若我早公布账，社员心中有个底，少做活的早就会积极起来了。”从这以后，他知道了一定要按期结算农业社的账目；定时的公布账目，不但可以提高全体社员的生产积极性，而且还便于大家共同来关心社内经济情况。不久，秋收分配的预分方案作好了，盖冀忠按照合作社社务管理委员会的决定公布了分配账单。他把用大红纸详细写出来的账单贴在饲养房的墙上，自己站在人群里倾听意见。识字的人念着，不识字的挤进去打听自己的账项是怎么结算的。他听到许多人唧咕着：“光知道劳力得的，粪土籽种得的，但社里的总收入、总支出黑着哩。”他一想：“对呀！大伙不摸整个社的底摊子，脑子就不会清楚。”这时，社务管理委员会根据群众的意见，决定把全部账在会上作详细的口头报告，不仅要让社员知道“大框框”、“小宗宗”，并且要让大家知道为啥要这样计算。同时，还要宣布凡有疑惑的都可以个别对账。盖冀忠根据社委会的决定，耐心地改进了工作，凡有对账的都细心地和他们细算细对，结果社员对农业社的账目很满意。盖生学分的少，但他经过算账后很心服，他对别人说：“不是咱没多分，是咱没做下工。社家一样，要在自己家里做这点活，怕还得不了这样多。”有的人说：“反正今年过去了，来年再看我的劳动。”总之，听了分配账目后，大家对社有了进一步的认识，劳动情绪有了更大的提高。
    盖冀忠就这样不断地吸收群众意见，不断地改进自己的会计工作。
    今年一月长安县在建立了第一期农业社后，把各个农业社的会计都调到王莽村来训练。很多新社的会计有空就到冀忠家里去问这问那。冀忠常对他们说：当好会计是件很重要的事，但首先得决心学习新账；其次还要不怕碰钉子，多倾听社员的意见。要是你能当个好会计，管保你越做越有兴头，因为你把账目弄的好，你就能亲眼瞧见它能给社员们多么大的鼓舞。
