    Preventing the Spread of Sweet Potato Black Rot
    Yang Fan
    Black rot is one of the serious diseases of sweet potatoes. Sweet potatoes can be infected with this disease from the seedling stage through growth and storage. Diseased seedlings have small black spots at the base; diseased potato tubers have slightly sunken black lesions on the skin; lightly diseased seed potatoes can sprout, but the sprouts are very weak, and severely diseased ones rot before the sprouts emerge from the soil. Infection of sweet potatoes with this disease often leads to phenomena such as seedling death and storage rot, which causes great losses to farmers. In 1953, seven villages in Qingyuan and Mancheng counties in Hebei Province lost 1.88 million catties of sweet potatoes due to storage rot, and in 1954, Ding County lost 5 billion old yuan due to seedling death. Feeding livestock with sweet potatoes infected with black rot can also poison them.
    Originally, only some areas of Hebei, Shandong, Henan and other provinces had sweet potato black rot. Due to the transport of seed potatoes and seedlings carrying the disease from these areas, the disease has spread to introduction areas in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hubei and other provinces. This year, some provinces have found diseased potatoes mixed in the transported seed potatoes. For example, in Dangtu County, Anhui Province, 3.4 percent of the 48,000 catties of seed potatoes introduced from Jimo County, Shandong Province, were diseased. At present, most areas are still transporting seed potatoes and seedlings or sprouting seed potatoes out of storage. These areas must pay close attention to preventing the spread of this disease.
    The purchase of seed potatoes and seedlings must be made in areas where this disease does not exist; if purchased in diseased areas, inspection must be strengthened. When inspecting in the purchasing area, first remove diseased tubers and seedlings, and then concentrate the unloading of goods after transporting them to the planting area for re-inspection. Experience has shown that after two inspections, in the place of origin and the place of sale, the phenomenon of seed potatoes carrying the disease can be greatly reduced or avoided. This is an effective way to prevent the spread of sweet potato black rot.
    Cultivating healthy seedlings is also an effective way to prevent the spread of sweet potato black rot. The method of cultivating healthy seedlings is to plant the introduced seed potatoes as much as possible in introduction nurseries set up by farms or agricultural production cooperatives with suitable conditions. After the seedlings grow, because the green parts of the seedlings are not easily infected with black rot, the vines can be cut off three or four inches above the ground to obtain disease-free healthy seedlings. In 1954, She County Farm in Hebei Province, due to the establishment of an introduction and seedling collection nursery, supplied the cut vines to agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups for trial planting. As a result, none of the 142 mu of sweet potatoes planted on trial with this type of seedling developed the disease.
    This year, many areas are planting sweet potatoes for the first time. These areas should pay attention to doing a good job in preventing black rot and completing this year's sweet potato production increase task.

    防止甘薯黑斑病的蔓延
    杨蕃
    黑斑病是甘薯的严重病害之一。甘薯从幼苗、长成到贮藏期间都能感染这种病。染病的幼苗的基部有黑色小斑点；染病的薯块的表皮有稍稍下陷的黑色病疤；染病轻的种薯虽可以出芽，但芽很衰弱，染病重的在幼芽没有出土前种薯就腐烂了。甘薯感染这种病后，往往造成死苗烂窖等现象，这对农民的损失是很大的。一九五三年河北省清苑、满城两县的七个村因烂窖损失甘薯一百八十八万斤，一九五四年定县因死苗损失了旧币五十亿元。用染黑斑病的甘薯喂牲畜还会使牲畜中毒。
    原来只有河北、山东、河南等省部分地区的甘薯有黑斑病，由于从这些地区往外调运的种薯和种苗中带有病薯病苗，以致这种病害蔓延到浙江、江西、湖北等省的引种地区。今年有些省已发现在调运的种薯中混有病薯，如安徽省当涂县从山东省即墨县引进的四万八千斤种薯中，就有百分之三点四是带病的。目前多数地区还在调运种薯种苗或进行种薯出窖育苗，这些地区必须严密注意防止这种病害的蔓延。
    采购种薯种苗必须到没有这种病害的地区；如在病区采购，必须加强检验。在采购地检验时先剔除病块病苗，运到播种地区后再集中卸货，进行复验。经验证明，经过产地和销地两次检验，种薯的带病现象可以大为减少或避免。这是防止甘薯黑斑病蔓延的一个有效办法。
    培育健苗也是防止甘薯黑斑病蔓延的一个有效办法。培育健苗的方法是先把引进的种薯尽可能种在农场或有条件的农业生产合作社所设置的引种苗圃内，等薯苗成长后，因薯苗的绿色部分不易感染黑斑病，在离地三、四寸高的地方剪下薯蔓，就可取得无病健苗。一九五四年河北省涉县农场，由于设置引种采苗圃，把剪下的薯蔓供给农业生产合作社和互助组试种，结果用这种种苗试种的一百四十二亩甘薯都没有发病。
    今年新种植甘薯的地区很多，这些地区要注意做好防止黑斑病的工作，完成今年甘薯增产的任务。
