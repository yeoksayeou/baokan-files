    Farmers in Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu and other places in the Yangtze River Basin are generally beginning to sow rice and cotton.
    In the rich Sichuan Province, the Dujiangyan irrigation area has generally begun to sow rice. In more than 280,000 mu of seedling fields, a large proportion has been sown with fine varieties such as "Chuan Nong 422," "Zhong Nong No. 4," and "Victory Xian." This year, due to the newly opened and extended Guan Canal and Xihe River water conservancy projects, the Dujiangyan irrigation area has expanded by 800,000 mu, and the total area of paddy fields in the area has increased from more than 3.2 million mu in 1954 to 4 million mu. At the same time, because new-style sluice gates were set up in key embankment sections of the Zouma River, Puyang River, and Baitiao River during annual repairs, and water management was strengthened, all farmland can be fully irrigated. The total grain output of the area will increase by 2 billion jin as a result. During the spring ploughing production period, the agricultural departments and supply and marketing cooperatives have successively supplied farmers with 370,000 jin of various improved varieties and 3,430 new-style farm tools. The supply of various pesticides to farmers has increased by more than three times compared with 1954, meeting the needs of rice borer control in seedling fields.
    After the completion of the Dongting Lake dike restoration project in Hunan Province, millions of farmers are working hard on spring ploughing within the new dikes, which are more than 3,000 kilometers long along the lake. In Ningxiang County Farm, the early rice in more than 220 mu of fields has been completely soaked, and some has already germinated. The seedling fields have also been completely prepared, waiting only for sowing. In order to support the vast number of farmers in the lake area in spring ploughing, the finance, grain, and agricultural departments of Hunan Province have successively transferred more than 18,000 head of ploughing cattle, more than 10,000 tons of early, middle, and late rice seeds, and 4,398,800 yuan in spring ploughing production loans from both inside and outside the province. After receiving this large amount of production funds and means of production, the enthusiasm of the farmers in the lake area has become even higher.
    Spring ploughing and sowing generally began in various parts of Hubei Province in mid-April. Due to the relatively late retreat of the floods last winter and excessive rainfall this spring, the maturity period of general summer crops has been delayed by about ten days compared with previous years. If rice seedlings are transplanted too late, it will affect the rice harvest. Therefore, new technologies such as widely setting up seedling fields, sowing sparse seedlings, and cultivating strong seedlings have been adopted more commonly in various places. In many agricultural production cooperatives in Xiangyang, Xishui, Tianmen, and other counties, this year's seedling fields have expanded by 30 to 50 percent compared with 1954. In order to cultivate strong seedlings, the amount of sowing per mu has been reduced from 200 jin in the past to 120 jin to 150 jin. In disaster areas, many farmers have planted early rice in order to shorten the time of summer famine. In the cotton-producing areas of Xiangyang, Tianmen, and other counties, farmers have actively carried out work such as seed selection. Throughout the province, a spring ploughing production movement centered on mutual assistance and cooperation is about to enter a climax.
    The early rice areas of Jiangsu Province are sowing, and the late rice areas are also preparing seedling ponds and selecting rice seeds, ready for sowing. The province has more than 32 million mu of paddy fields, mainly concentrated in the water network area on both sides of the Yangtze River. This year, various places have reformed rice cultivation techniques according to local characteristics. Sheyang, Binhai, Dafeng, Nantong, Qidong and other counties in the cotton reclamation area along the Yellow Sea in Jiangsu Province have successively started sowing cotton. Farmers in cotton-grain intercropping areas such as Rugao, Hai'an, Suining, Tongshan, and Huaiyin are leveling land and building ridges in cotton fields, preparing for sowing. Jiangsu Province plans to increase the cotton sowing area by more than 1 million mu in 1955 compared with last year. The area sown with improved varieties is more than 2.7 million mu more than last year.

### 长江流域农民播种水稻和棉花

    长江流域农民播种水稻和棉花
    本报讯　长江流域的四川、湖南、湖北、江苏等地农民普遍开始播种水稻和棉花。
    富饶的四川省都江堰灌溉区普遍开始播种水稻。二十八万多亩秧田中，很大一部分都播种了“川农四二二”、“中农四号”、“胜利籼”等优良品种。今年由于新开和延长了官渠、西河两处水利工程，都江堰灌溉面积扩大了八十万亩，全区水田已由一九五四年的三百二十多万亩增加到四百万亩。同时由于岁修中在走马河、蒲阳河、柏条河等重点堤段设置了新式水闸，加强了用水管理，所有农田都能充分得到灌溉。全区粮食产量将会因此增加二十亿斤。春耕生产期间，农业部门和供销合作社已先后供应给农民各种良种三十七万斤，新式农具三千四百三十部。供应给农民的各种农药比一九五四年增加了三倍多，满足了秧田治螟的需要。
    湖南省洞庭湖堤垸修复工程完工后，在滨湖三千多公里长的新堤内，数百万农民正紧张进行春耕。宁乡县农场的二百二十多亩田的早稻已经全部浸种，部分已经发芽，秧田也全部整理好，只待播种。为了支援湖区广大农民春耕，湖南省财经、粮食和农业部门先后从省内外调去耕牛一万八千多头，早、中、晚稻种谷一万多吨，春耕生产贷款四百三十九万八千多元。滨湖区农民得到这批大量生产资金和生产资料后，生产积极性更加高涨。
    湖北省各地在四月中旬普遍开始春耕播种。由于去冬洪水退的较迟，今春雨水过多，一般夏收作物的成熟期都比往年推迟十天左右。如果插秧过迟，就要影响水稻的收成。因此各地比较普遍地采用了宽办秧田、下稀秧、培育壮秧的新技术。在襄阳、浠水、天门等县的许多农业生产合作社里，今年的秧脚田比一九五四年扩大了百分之三十到五十。为了培育壮秧，每亩播种量由过去的二百斤减少到一百二十斤至一百五十斤。在灾区，为了缩短夏荒的时间，很多农民都种植了早稻。在襄阳、天门等县的产棉区，农民们积极进行了选种等工作。在全省范围内，一个以互助合作为中心的春耕生产运动即将进入高潮。
    江苏省的早稻地区正在播种，晚稻地区也在整秧池、选稻种，准备播种。全省有三千二百多万亩水稻田，主要集中在长江两岸水网地区。今年各地都根据当地特点改革水稻的栽培技术。江苏省沿黄海的棉垦区射阳、滨海、大丰、南通、启东等县已相继开始播种棉花。棉粮夹种地区的如皋、海安、睢宁、铜山、淮阴等地农民正在棉田整地筑畦，准备播种。江苏省一九五五年计划棉花播种面积比去年增加一百多万亩。播种良种面积比去年多二百七十万亩。
