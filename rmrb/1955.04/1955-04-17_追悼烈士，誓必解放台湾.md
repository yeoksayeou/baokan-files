    Today, the Chinese people mourn with the deepest sorrow the comrades and friends who were murdered by American and Chiang Kai-shek special agents. They have left us forever, but they have left us with the strongest determination and the firmest belief. Shi Zhi'ang, Li Zhaoji, Zhong Buyun, Shen Jiantu, Huang Zuomei, Du Hong, Li Ping, Hao Fengge, these comrades, as well as Wang Mingfang, a staff member of the delegation from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Polish journalist Starowicz, and the Austrian journalist Jan Fyedler, were all murdered for the cause of friendship, cooperation, independence, and freedom between the peoples of Asia and Africa. Their cause will continue and develop, and they will forever live in the hearts of the Chinese people and the peoples of Asia and Africa.

    Among those who perished at the same time as martyr Shi Zhi'ang were staff members of Air India International on the same plane. They also suffered the same tragic fate as martyr Shi Zhi'ang and others because of the common cause of the Asian-African Conference. The Chinese people express their deepest sympathy and condolences for this loss to the Indian people. For the sake of seeking friendship and cooperation among the peoples of Asia and Africa and for safeguarding peace in the Asia-Africa region, the blood of people from different countries has been united for the first time. This is a symbol of the common will of the Asian and African people, and it can never be erased.

    While mourning the eleven martyrs including Shi Zhi'ang, the Chinese people feel boundless anger towards the American aggressive bloc and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique who murdered the above-mentioned personnel.

    The United States, in collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, vilely murdered members of the Chinese delegation and Chinese and foreign journalists attending the Asian-African Conference, as part of its enormous conspiracy to sabotage the conference. Because the Asian-African Conference helps promote goodwill and cooperation among the peoples of Asian and African countries, and helps to maintain peace in the Asia-Africa region, the United States regards this conference as a huge obstacle to its aggression and expansion in Asia and Africa, and does its utmost to sabotage it. But the Asian-African Conference is the result of the historical development of Asia and Africa, and the result of the struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa for independence and to defend peace. It can never be sabotaged by the American aggressive bloc. The United States committed a despicable murder in order to sabotage the Asian-African Conference, which only proves that it is the most vicious enemy of independence and peace in Asia and Africa. After the incident, the American aggressive bloc tried its best to deny its responsibility. The US State Department insisted that accusing American-Chiang Kai-shek special agents of sabotaging the plane was "without any basis." It tried to prevent people from considering the possibility of special agents sabotaging the plane, and it was afraid of touching on this issue. This is entirely a manifestation of a guilty conscience. At the same time, the United States fabricated news, trying to make people believe that the plane crash was due to mechanical failure rather than sabotage by special agents. But this kind of nonsense was immediately bankrupt. Passengers who had flown on the plane from Bombay to Hong Kong and Air India International all refuted the so-called claim propagated by the United States that the plane was "unfit to fly." The American aggressive bloc also adopted even more despicable means, attempting to confuse the public, obscure the truth, and escape its responsibility by absurdly slandering the Chinese people and the victims. This shameless trick of the American aggressive bloc cannot conceal its crimes in the slightest, but instead proves that it is the instigator behind the murderers. The British authorities in Hong Kong had already received a warning from the Chinese government about the conspiracy for this murder. But the murder still occurred. The British authorities in Hong Kong must thoroughly investigate this case and punish the criminals. It must not evade its serious responsibility. The crime of the American aggressive bloc in collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in murdering the eleven martyrs including Shi Zhi'ang clearly shows that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique under American protection is completely a den of murderers and secret agent bandits. It is a tool for the United States to carry out aggression in Asia, undermine peace, and undermine unity and cooperation between Asian countries. It is the most serious threat to peace in Asia. If the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is not eliminated for one day, and Taiwan is not liberated for one day, the United States will use every opportunity to collude with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to carry out more assassinations and sabotage against the Chinese people, and use every opportunity to use the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to prepare for war and undermine peace in Asia and the world.

    When mourning the eleven martyrs including Shi Zhi'ang, the Chinese people will forever remember this murder committed by the American aggressive bloc and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and will forever remember the martyrs' legacy of defending national independence and defending peace in Asia. The firm determination that the martyrs left us is that we must liberate Taiwan and we must eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. We must dedicate the victory of liberating Taiwan to the martyrs' altar. This is our oath, our belief.

### 追悼烈士，誓必解放台湾

    追悼烈士，誓必解放台湾
    今天，中国人民以最沉痛的心情追悼被美国和蒋介石特务分子谋害了的同志们和朋友们。他们同我们永别了，但是他们给我们留下了最坚强的决心和最坚定的信念。石志昂、李肇基、钟步云、沈建图、黄作梅、杜宏、李平、郝凤格这些同志们和越南民主共和国代表团工作人员王明芳、波兰记者斯塔列茨、奥地利记者严斐德这些同志们，都是为了亚非两洲人民友好合作和独立自由的事业而被谋杀的。他们的事业将要继续和发展下去，他们将永远活在中国人民和亚非两洲人民的心里。
    和石志昂烈士等同时遇难的还有在这架飞机上的印度国际航空公司的工作人员。他们也是由于亚非会议的共同事业而和石志昂烈士等一起遭了毒手的。中国人民对于印度人民的这种损失表示最深切的同情和慰问。为了谋求亚非人民的友好和合作，为了维护亚非地区的和平，不同国家的人民的鲜血第一次凝结在一起，这是亚非人民共同意志的象征，这是永远不能磨灭的。
    中国人民在悼念石志昂等十一位烈士的同时，对于谋杀上述人员的美国侵略集团和蒋介石卖国集团感到无比的愤怒。
    美国伙同蒋介石匪徒卑鄙地谋杀出席亚非会议的中国代表团人员和中外记者，是它破坏亚非会议的巨大阴谋的一部分。由于亚非会议有助于促进亚非各国人民之间的亲善和合作、有助于维护亚非地区的和平，所以美国把这个会议看作是它在亚非两洲进行侵略和扩张的巨大障碍，竭力进行破坏。但是亚非会议是亚非两洲历史发展的结果，是亚非两洲人民为争取独立和保卫和平而斗争的结果。它绝不是美国侵略集团所能破坏得了的。美国为了破坏亚非会议而制造卑劣的谋杀事件，只是证明了它是亚非两洲独立和和平的最凶恶的敌人。美国侵略集团在事件发生以后竭力企图抵赖它的罪责。美国国务院一口咬定说指责美蒋特务分子破坏飞机是“没有丝毫根据的”。它企图使人们不去考虑特务分子破坏飞机的可能性，它害怕触及到这个问题，这完全是它作贼心虚的表现。同时美国方面捏造消息，企图使人相信飞机失事是由于机件故障而不是特务破坏。但是这种鬼话也立刻宣告破产了。从孟买到香港乘坐过这架飞机的旅客和印度国际航空公司方面都驳斥了美国所宣传的所谓飞机“不宜于飞行”的说法。美国侵略集团还采取了更加卑鄙的手段，企图用荒谬地诬蔑中国人民和死难者们来混乱视听、模糊真相，逃避自己的罪责。美国侵略集团这种无耻伎俩丝毫不能掩饰它的罪行，反而证明了它正是杀人犯背后的主使者。香港英国当局对于这次谋杀罪行的阴谋早已得到了中国政府的警告。但是谋杀事件竟仍然发生。香港英国当局必须彻底查究这个案件，惩办凶犯。它决不能闪避它所负的严重责任。美国侵略集团伙同蒋介石卖国集团谋杀石志昂等十一名烈士的罪行再清楚也没有地说明了：美国庇护下的蒋介石卖国集团完全是一窠杀人犯和特务匪徒。它是美国在亚洲进行侵略、破坏和平、破坏亚洲国家之间团结合作的工具。它是亚洲和平的最严重的威胁。蒋介石卖国集团一天不消灭，台湾一天不解放，美国就要利用一切机会伙同蒋介石卖国集团对中国人民进行更多的暗杀和破坏，利用一切机会用蒋介石卖国集团来准备战争、破坏亚洲和世界的和平。
    中国人民在悼念石志昂等十一位烈士的时候，将要永远记住美国侵略集团和蒋介石卖国集团的这一谋杀罪行，永远记住烈士们的保卫祖国独立、保卫亚洲和平的遗志。烈士们留给我们的坚定决心是一定要解放台湾，一定要消灭蒋介石卖国集团。我们一定要把解放台湾的胜利奉献于烈士们的祭坛之前。这就是我们的誓言、我们的信念。
