Xinhua News Agency, Osaka, 7th. The Chinese Trade Delegation to Japan attended a welcome banquet hosted jointly by the Osaka Prefecture, Osaka City, and the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry on the evening of the 6th.

Among those attending the banquet were Yamanura Shonosuke, acting governor of Osaka Prefecture; Hashimoto Masami, acting mayor of Osaka City; Sugi Michisuke, president of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Asano Totaro, speaker of the Osaka City Council; Yosamatsu Matsubara, manager of Hitachi Shipbuilding; Koichi Uda, manager of Yodogawa Steel Works; and Kantaro Sugano, Director-General of the Kansai Bureau of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and Doctor of Economics, and more than fifty other people.

In his welcoming speech, Yamanura Shonosuke, acting governor of Osaka Prefecture, said: Osaka is geographically close to China and has a deep economic relationship with China, so it is very concerned about expanding trade with China. He said: The industrial area centered on Osaka can provide China with the materials needed for construction, such as machinery, metals, and chemicals. He hoped that the delegation would learn more about the actual situation of trade and industry in the Kansai region, and hoped to expand the export of various products to China.

In his speech, Delegation Leader Lei Renmin said: Osaka is one of Japan's main industrial and commercial centers and has close economic ties with China. Its trade volume accounts for a large proportion of Sino-Japanese trade, so it is also one of the cities that the Chinese Trade Delegation very much hopes to visit. After pointing out the reasons hindering the development of Sino-Japanese trade and the broad prospects for future development, he also pointed out the role played by Osaka's business community in expanding Sino-Japanese trade.

Lei Renmin said: It is welcome that Acting Governor Yamanura said that the Kansai industrial zone can supply China with the machinery, metal, and chemical products needed for construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Osaka, 7th. The Chinese Trade Delegation to Japan attended a welcome luncheon held by the Osaka Prefectural Assembly on the afternoon of the 7th.

On the Japanese side, those present included Uemoto Keiichi, Speaker of the Osaka Prefectural Assembly, Maeda Jiichiro, Chairman of the Trade Promotion Committee of the Osaka Prefectural Assembly, prefectural assembly members from the Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, the Left-wing Socialist Party, the Right-wing Socialist Party, and the Communist Party, as well as Omori Michitaka, Vice Governor of Osaka Prefecture, and Tsukamoto Toshio, Director of Commerce and Industry, and many others.

Uemoto Keiichi said in his welcoming speech: Small and medium-sized enterprises and large enterprises in Osaka sincerely welcome the arrival of the Chinese Trade Delegation to Osaka. It is hoped that this visit of the Chinese Trade Delegation to Japan will significantly advance trade relations between China and Japan.

Delegation Leader Lei Renmin said in his speech that the Chinese Trade Delegation is willing to conduct extensive contacts with the Osaka business community, and to visit and hold discussions to increase mutual understanding, thereby finding greater possibilities for developing trade.
