　　The 2,216 Jiangxi water paddy field plows manufactured by the Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural Machinery Repair Factory have been shipped to the countryside in late March and put into spring plowing production.

　　In the past, the Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural Machinery Repair Factory mainly helped farmers repair farm tools and water pumps, and also manufactured some small farm tools. Considering that this type of work could no longer meet the needs of mutual assistance and cooperation and agricultural production development, the factory leadership decided to improve the Jiangxi water paddy field plow based on the manufacturing of old plows. When the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture learned of this situation, it promptly transferred cadres and organized a farm tool experiment and research team to work in the factory, concentrating on studying the Jiangxi water paddy field plow. In addition, a special investigation and experiment team for water paddy field plows was organized. In September 1954, twenty people (nine farm tool cadres, three farm tool research team members, four plow woodworkers, four farmer representatives) were organized into four groups to conduct investigations and experiments in thirty-seven counties, forty-three agricultural production cooperatives, seven mutual aid groups, seven county farms, seven county Party building and cooperative building training classes, and one nursery throughout the province. They systematically investigated and understood the structure, performance, and usage of old water paddy field plows, as well as the agricultural cultivation, planting, and soil farming animals in various regions. Based on in-depth investigation and research, the design of the Jiangxi water paddy field plow was created. After several revisions, it was decided to first manufacture twelve units and then conduct on-site testing. If it was indeed more efficient than the old water paddy field plow, then mass production and promotion would follow. Twelve new Jiangxi water paddy field plows were produced, and they were divided into four groups carrying the Jiangxi water paddy field plows to eleven counties including Pingxiang, Yichun, Shangrao, Linchuan, and Duchang for key experiments, proving that the Jiangxi water paddy field plow was indeed more efficient than the old water paddy field plow.

　　When the students of the Shangrao Farm Tool Cadre Training Class first saw the Jiangxi water paddy field plow, they felt that the structure was too simple. Some said, "I'm afraid that three of these water paddy field plows are not as good as one old plow. If you really plow the field with it, I'm afraid it won't be as efficient as the old plow!" The students curiously asked to try the new plow. At this time, the old farmer Yao Tianting heard that the new plow was going to be tested, so he carried an old plow. He said, "I'll take the old plow to compare with the Jiangxi water paddy field plow!" Then he started plowing the field, and everyone followed behind the plow, measuring the depth and width. After plowing a few circles, they saw that the Jiangxi water paddy field plow plowed the bottom of the furrow flat, turned the soil quickly, and the person holding it did not have to work hard. The pulling force was light, and the plowing was deep and wide. The old farmer who was competing next to him, holding the old plow, deliberately plowed deeper and wider, resulting in a lot of sweat and difficulty in holding the plow steady. The old farmer saw that he couldn't compare, so he put it down and stopped plowing. He smiled and said, "Good fellow, plows really fast, the bottom of the furrow is flat, wide, and deep, just right."

　　After such on-site experiments in various places and the appraisal by more than 300 agricultural cadres at the provincial agricultural technology conference, it was considered that the Jiangxi water paddy field plow had five major advantages: 1. Able to plow deep and increase production: Due to the reasonable gap at the bottom of the plow and the large adjustment range, and the good quality, deep plowing will not break the plowshare. Generally, it can plow to a depth of four to five inches, and the deepest can plow to six inches, which is one inch to one and a half inches deeper than the old plow. 2. Stable and easy to hold: Enters the soil smoothly, the depth is consistent, and the person holding it does not have to work hard. Even women and semi-laborers who have not plowed the field can use it. 3. Light pulling force and high work efficiency: Because the structure of the Jiangxi water paddy field plow is more reasonable than the old plow, the curve of the plow wing is good, and the interface between the plowshare and plow wing is smooth, it enters the soil, lifts the soil, and covers the soil quickly, so the pulling force is light, 15% lighter than the old plow. The width adjustment of the Jiangxi water paddy field plow is flexible and stable, generally it can plow to a width of seven inches, and the maximum can plow to a width of eight and a half inches. Two new plows can replace three old plows. 4. Good soil turning, the bottom of the furrow is flatter than the old plow: Because the plow wing is good, the soil turning is even, the soil is thrown far, and the soil covering is more airtight than the old plow. Weeds and rice stubble can be turned down, reducing weed growth and increasing soil fertility. 5. Simple, inexpensive, and durable: The plowshare and plow wing are made of gray cast iron, the plowshare edge is cold-cast, and the structure of the plow frame is relatively tight, and the plow beam is straighter than the old plow, so it is stronger than the old plow. The Jiangxi water paddy field plow can plow fields that the old plow cannot.

　　After extensive on-site testing and appraisal confirmed that the Jiangxi water paddy field plow had more advantages than the old plow, the Provincial Department of Agriculture decided to mass-produce and promote it throughout the province, and decided that the Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural Machinery Repair Factory would manufacture 2,000 Jiangxi water paddy field plows in the first quarter of 1955, to be completed before spring plowing.

　　The Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural Machinery Repair Factory accepted this task in January. At that time, there were still many difficulties in terms of materials and technology, but because all the factory workers clarified the policy of serving farmers by the agricultural machinery repair factory in their minds, they overcame many difficulties. For example, there was a severe shortage of wood (hardwood) for making plows at that time, and the Provincial Timber Company did not have dry wood. The leadership promptly transferred cadres to organize a procurement team to go deep into the timber production area of Fuliang County to purchase wood. The wood purchased at that time was all freshly felled, and it was not very dry. They organized local woodworkers to make finished products and transport them back to Nanchang, which not only saved time but also reduced the weight of transportation. Four of these seven people were separated and went to Poyang, Duchang, and other counties to organize woodworkers, and the moisture of the freshly felled wood was absorbed through steaming, and then the woodworkers made finished products and transported them back to Nanchang on schedule. The workers in the factory who were responsible for the iron parts such as plowshares, plow wings, and plow hooks also launched a labor emulation campaign. Because the factory building was too small, the workshop director Zhang Binggen suggested changing to a two-shift system, and the leadership promptly adopted this suggestion and used water pumps to drive the air drum to start the furnace, ensuring the normal progress of production. During the competition, the foundry workers also created molds with multiple cavities, which doubled the output of plowshares and plow wings. Some workers also created inspection tools for plow frames and plow wing curves, so that the specifications and quality of the Jiangxi water paddy field plow completely met the standards, from the initial production of more than 80 units per day to more than 100 units. On March 23, the task was completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target.

　　This batch of Jiangxi water paddy field plows was warmly welcomed when it was supplied to the farmers. In order to meet the needs of agricultural production development, the Provincial Department of Agriculture decided to continue to mass-produce Jiangxi water paddy field plows this year and promote them throughout the province. All the staff of the Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural Machinery Repair Factory will invest in more intense production and make greater contributions to agricultural production.

    江西农民欢迎江西水田犁
    本报记者　孙祖年
    江西省农业机械修配厂制造的两千二百一十六部江西水田犁，已在三月下旬运往农村投入春耕生产了。
    江西省农业机械修配厂，过去主要是帮助农民修理农具和抽水机，还制造一部分小型农具。工厂领导上考虑到这种工作状况，已不能适应互助合作和农业生产发展的需要，便决定在制造旧犁的基础上来着手改进江西水田犁。江西省农业厅知道了这一情况，就及时抽调了干部，组织了一个农具试验研究组住厂工作，集中精力研究江西水田犁。另外专门组织水田犁的调查试验专业小组，在一九五四年九月内组织二十个人（农具干部九人，农具研究组三人，犁木工四人，农民代表四人），分四个小组，分别在全省三十七个县、四十三个农业生产合作社、七个互助组、七个县农场、七个县建党建社训练班、一个苗圃进行调查试验。有系统地调查了解了旧有水田犁的结构、性能和使用情况，以及各地农业耕作、栽培和土壤耕畜等情况。在深入调查研究的基础上，设计出江西水田犁的图样，经过几次修改，决定先制造十二部，再实地试验，如果确比旧水田犁效率要高，再大批制造和推广。十二部新式江西水田犁出厂了，他们又分了四个组携带江西水田犁到萍乡、宜春、上饶、临川、都昌等十一个县进行了重点试验，证明江西水田犁比旧水田犁效率的确高。
    上饶农具干部训练班的学员开始看到江西水田犁时，觉得结构太简单，有的说：“这种水田犁恐怕三个还抵不上老犁一个大，要真的耕起田来，怕还没有老犁的效率高哩！”学员们好奇地要求试一试新犁，这时老农民姚天庭听说要试验新犁，就扛来一部老犁，他说：“我拿老犁来同江西水田犁比比看！”接着就耕起田来，大家都跟在犁的后面，量量深浅、宽窄，犁了几圈就看出了江西水田犁耕地沟底平、翻土快、人扶不费力、拉力轻、耕的深又宽。在旁比赛的老农民，扶着老犁，故意耕深耕宽一些，结果累了一身大汗，犁还扶不稳。老农民看到比不过了，也就放下不耕了。他笑着说：“好家伙，耕得真快，沟底又平、又宽、又深，要得。”
    经各地这样实地试验和全省农业技术会议三百多农业干部进行鉴定的结果，认为江西水田犁有五大优点：一、能够深耕增产：由于犁底间隙合理、调节范围大，同时质量好，深耕不会断犁头。一般能深耕到四至五寸，最深的可以深耕到六寸，较老犁能深耕一寸到一寸半。二、平稳好扶：入土平稳、深浅一致、人扶不费劲，就是没有犁过田的妇女和半劳动力，都能使用。三、拉力轻、工作效率高：由于江西水田犁的结构比老犁合理、犁壁曲线好、犁头犁壁接口平滑，入土起土覆土很快，所以拉力轻，比老犁轻百分之十五。江西水田犁宽窄调节灵便、平稳前进，一般可耕宽到七寸，最大可耕宽到八寸半，两部新式犁可抵三部老犁。四、翻土好，沟底较老犁平整：由于犁壁较好、翻土均匀，土抛得远，盖土比老犁严密，可以将杂草禾兜等翻下，减少杂草生长，增加土壤肥力。五、简便价廉又耐用：犁头犁壁是用灰口铁制成的，犁头刃口并经冷铸，犁架的结构也比较紧密，而且犁辕比老犁直一点，因此比老犁坚固，老犁不能耕的田，江西水田犁可以耕。
    在经过较广泛的实地试验和鉴定，证实了江西水田犁确比旧犁优点多之后，省农业厅才确定大批制造和在全省推广，并决定江西省农业机械修配厂一九五五年第一季度制造出江西水田犁两千部，在春耕前完成。
    江西省农业机械修配厂在一月份接受了这个任务，当时在材料、技术方面还存在不少困难，但由于全厂职工从思想上明确了农业机械修配厂为农民生产服务的方针，克服重重困难。比如当时制犁的木材（硬木）非常缺乏，省木材公司又没有干燥的木材，领导上就及时抽调干部组织采购小组，深入到浮梁县木材产地去采购；当时采购的木材都是现伐的木料，很不干燥，他们就地组织木工制成成品运回南昌，这样既可赶上时间，还可减少运输重量。这七个人中又抽出四人分头去鄱阳、都昌等县组织木工，通过蒸制的办法吸干了现伐木材水分然后由木工做成成品，按期运回了南昌。在厂内担任犁头、犁壁、犁挂钩等铁制部分的工人，也开展了劳动竞赛运动。因为这个厂的厂房太小，车间主任张炳根就建议改成日夜两班制，领导上及时采纳了这个建议，并用抽水机带动风鼓开炉，保证了生产的正常进行。在竞赛中、铸工们还创造了一模多型的模子，使犁头犁壁产量提高了两倍。有的工人还创造了检验犁架和犁壁曲线工具，使江西水田犁的规格、质量完全合乎标准，由开始每天生产八十多部提高到一百多部。在三月二十三日就提前超额完成了任务。
    这批江西水田犁供应到农民手里时，受到热烈的欢迎。为了适应农业生产发展的需要，省农业厅决定今年内继续大批制造江西水田犁，普遍在全省推广。江西省农业机械修配厂全体职工，将投入更紧张的生产，为农业生产作出更大的贡献。
