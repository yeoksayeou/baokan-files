    The Asian Countries Conference, which the Asian people have eagerly requested, opens today in Delhi, India. This is a major gathering of Asian people for peace. Approximately 225 delegates from eighteen countries are attending the conference. These representatives are drawn from various strata of the people of their respective countries. Therefore, this conference has broad representation. The delegates will freely exchange views on common issues concerning the interests of the Asian people, particularly the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This conference will have a significant impact on opposing war, safeguarding peace, enhancing friendship and unity among the Asian people, and strengthening ties among the people of Asian countries. It is conducive to easing the current tense situation in the Far East and internationally and consolidating peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese people wholeheartedly welcome this conference and congratulate it on achieving satisfactory results.

    The preparations for the Asian Countries Conference demonstrate the great importance that the people and public opinion of Asian countries attach to this conference. More than one hundred members of the Indian Parliament and members of provincial legislative assemblies participated in the preparations. Mass rallies supporting the Asian Countries Conference were also held in various parts of India. Many prominent figures in Japan, including former Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama and current Minister of International Trade and Industry Tanzan Ishibashi, have supported this conference. The Lebanese newspapers "Al-Hayat" and "Al-Akhbar" published commentaries hoping that the conference would express the deep aspirations of the Arab people and improve relations between Asian countries. This reflects the importance that the people of the Middle East attach to the conference. The people of China, the Soviet Union, the Mongolian People's Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have all made full preparations for the conference and attach great importance to the role it plays in consolidating peace in Asia and the world.

    It is only natural that the Asian people attach importance to the Asian Countries Conference. Because the conference provides an opportunity for peaceful representatives from Asian countries to gather together, freely exchange views, and seek to pool the wisdom and strength of the Asian people to contribute to promoting the resolution of various issues related to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. This is of great significance in Asian history and was unimaginable in the era of imperialism's rule over Asia. The holding of the Asian Countries Conference itself symbolizes the further strengthening of friendship and unity among the Asian people and marks the Asian people's love of peace and their determination to defend peace.

    Asia's population accounts for more than half of the world's population. Imperialists have always regarded Asia's rich human resources as targets for their exploitation and plunder, and have used them as a source of troops and reserves for aggression. But now the Asian people have awakened. The Asian people are breaking free from the colonial shackles of imperialism and taking their destiny into their own hands. Some have already achieved independence, and others are on the road to independence. Maintaining their independence and security, and building their own beautiful and happy life, is the common aspiration of the awakened Asian people. The Asian people are increasingly aware that to realize these aspirations, they must oppose war and safeguard peace. This ardent desire for peace is making the Asian people appear on the historical stage as a new and great force for peace. The Asian Countries Conference is to further strengthen the unity and understanding between the Asian people, so that the Asian peace forces can play a more powerful role in easing international tensions and consolidating peace in Asia and the world.

    For this reason, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have become the first item on the agenda of the Asian Countries Conference. The Five Principles, which advocate mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, are widely welcomed by all countries that are willing to maintain their own independence and development, and are also willing to respect the independence and development of other countries. For Asian countries, the realization of the Five Principles is of more immediate interest. Because if the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence can be realized, Asian countries will be able to maintain and achieve their own independence, unite and cooperate on the basis of non-interference from outside, and achieve economic and cultural prosperity and development in a peaceful environment. The agenda of the Asian Countries Conference includes four aspects: political, economic, cultural, and scientific. The entire agenda runs through the Asian people's demand for the realization of the Five Principles and reflects the struggles currently faced by the Asian people in their efforts to safeguard peace and strive for and consolidate independence. From the agenda, it can be seen that the Asian people are making great efforts in this broad and complex struggle.

    The people of Asian countries have made great contributions to defending peace, striving for and consolidating independence. In the great movement to strive for world peace, the Asian people have always actively stood at the forefront of this team with a new, vigorous, and magnificent spirit. Their struggle against war, against colonial enslavement, and against atomic weapons wars has promoted the widespread development of the peace movement. The achievements of the 1952 Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference are a notable proof. Asian countries are also striving to enhance mutual understanding and friendly cooperation. The mutual visits of the Prime Ministers of China and India, China and Burma, and the Prime Ministers of other Asian countries, the Five Principles advocated by Asian countries, the joint declaration of the Chinese and Soviet governments, and the joint communiqu√© of the Prime Ministers of India and Egypt, have greatly promoted the consolidation of peace in Asia. China, India, and other Asian countries of the Colombo Conference have made important contributions to the peaceful settlement of some major international issues in Asia, such as the Korean issue and the Indochina issue. Recently, at the initiative of the Colombo countries, twenty-nine Asian and African countries will soon hold the Asian-African Conference in Indonesia to seek to enhance and establish mutual understanding and friendly relations. These efforts by Asian countries and their people have greatly enhanced the international prestige of Asian countries, demonstrated the increasingly important position and role of the Asian people in world affairs, and inspired and strengthened the world people's confidence and strength in striving for peace.

    However, the American aggressor bloc, because it wants to seize world hegemony, is deeply afraid and hates these efforts of the Asian people, and uses various methods to obstruct and undermine them. It is doing its utmost to undermine peace and prepare for war. The United States is obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea, undermining the Geneva Accords, and attempting to keep Korea and Indochina permanently divided. It is infringing on the independence of Asian countries, interfering in their internal affairs, and establishing American military bases on their territories. It is organizing aggressive military blocs in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, creating division and antagonism among Asian countries, and engaging in provocations and discord in order to prepare for new wars. In order to force the Asian people to submit to the will of the United States and act as tools of American aggression, the United States arrogantly flaunts its "strength" and clamors to use atomic weapons in Asia. At the same time, the United States has expressed its willingness to cooperate with Asian countries in the so-called peaceful use of atomic energy, which the United States itself has not carried out, in an attempt to deceive Asian countries and take the opportunity to plunder Asian atomic raw materials.

    This behavior of the American aggressor bloc has created tension and the threat of war in Asia, aroused great indignation among the Asian people, and has been resisted in many places. The Asian people resolutely oppose American colonialism, demand a ban on the use of atomic weapons, and resolutely advocate that atomic energy be used for peaceful purposes. The signature campaign demanding a ban on the use of atomic weapons is vigorously unfolding throughout Asia.

    The American behavior of undermining peace is particularly blatant in its occupation of China's territory Taiwan. The United States interferes in China's internal affairs and openly uses the threat of war to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. After occupying Taiwan, the United States has become even more greedy, attempting to occupy the coastal islands, and has undisguisedly expressed its intention to attack the Chinese mainland. At the same time, the United States is playing the trick of a "ceasefire", attempting to create so-called "two Chinas" with the conditions of withdrawing from the coastal islands and assisting Britain in protecting its colonial interests in the Far East, luring Britain and some Commonwealth countries, and dragging them into participating in the aggression against China. This blatant act of aggression by the United States has made the situation in the Taiwan area extremely tense and seriously threatens peace in Asia and the world. In order to defend peace and maintain its independence, the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and resolutely demand that the American aggressor forces withdraw from the Taiwan area.

    The Asian people demand the establishment of normal economic and cultural exchanges between countries in order to enhance mutual understanding and cooperation, break away from their dependence on imperialist countries, and develop their own economies and cultures. Based on this common demand, Asian countries have signed many economic and trade agreements, and mutual visits of trade delegations have become increasingly frequent. Expos have been held in many Asian countries to promote mutual trade. Asian countries have also dispatched various cultural delegations, art troupes, and social groups to visit and learn from each other. These visits have been greatly welcomed and have greatly strengthened the unity and friendship between the Asian people.

    However, the United States attempts to hang an iron curtain between Asian countries, obstructing and undermining economic and cultural exchanges between them. The United States forces Asian countries to implement embargoes and restrictions, hindering their trade with China, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries. The United States is trying to control the economies of Asian countries, turning them into markets for dumping American surplus products. At the same time, the United States uses its monopoly position in the capitalist world market to lower the prices of raw materials produced by Asian countries, causing them huge losses. Even Japan, which has a considerable industrial base, has suffered huge trade deficits with the United States due to the American embargo policy. This selfish policy of the United States is being met with increasingly strong opposition from the Asian people.

    All of this shows that what forms the current Asian situation are two opposing basic factors: on the one hand, the Asian people who have broken free from colonial oppression and are breaking free; on the other hand, the imperialists, led by the American aggressor bloc, who are trying to maintain and expand their colonial rule. This is a struggle between nascent forces and dying forces, between peace and war. The American aggressor bloc is attempting to use all means to prepare to launch wars of aggression in order to continue enslaving the Asian people. And the Asian people must use all their strength to defend peace in order to maintain their independence, freedom and security.

    It is clear that the discussion of all these aspects of the struggle at the Asian Countries Conference will greatly strengthen the Asian people's victorious confidence in defending peace and promote the peace movement in Asia and the world. The Asian people are industrious and brave people. As long as the Asian people are united, shoulder the cause of defending peace, and persevere to the end, peace can be maintained and the war schemes of the American aggressor bloc can be defeated. The Chinese people will be closely united with all the people of Asia to work together to defend peace in Asia and the world.
