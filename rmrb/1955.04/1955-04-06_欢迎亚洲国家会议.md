    The Asian Countries Conference, which the Asian people have eagerly requested, opens today in Delhi, India. This is a major gathering of Asian people for peace. Approximately 225 delegates from eighteen countries are attending the conference. These representatives are drawn from various strata of the people of their respective countries. Therefore, this conference has broad representation. The delegates will freely exchange views on common issues concerning the interests of the Asian people, particularly the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This conference will have a significant impact on opposing war, safeguarding peace, enhancing friendship and unity among the Asian people, and strengthening ties among the people of Asian countries. It is conducive to easing the current tense situation in the Far East and internationally and consolidating peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese people wholeheartedly welcome this conference and congratulate it on achieving satisfactory results.

    The preparations for the Asian Countries Conference demonstrate the great importance that the people and public opinion of Asian countries attach to this conference. More than one hundred members of the Indian Parliament and members of provincial legislative assemblies participated in the preparations. Mass rallies supporting the Asian Countries Conference were also held in various parts of India. Many prominent figures in Japan, including former Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama and current Minister of International Trade and Industry Tanzan Ishibashi, have supported this conference. The Lebanese newspapers "Al-Hayat" and "Al-Akhbar" published commentaries hoping that the conference would express the deep aspirations of the Arab people and improve relations between Asian countries. This reflects the importance that the people of the Middle East attach to the conference. The people of China, the Soviet Union, the Mongolian People's Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have all made full preparations for the conference and attach great importance to the role it plays in consolidating peace in Asia and the world.

    It is only natural that the Asian people attach importance to the Asian Countries Conference. Because the conference provides an opportunity for peaceful representatives from Asian countries to gather together, freely exchange views, and seek to pool the wisdom and strength of the Asian people to contribute to promoting the resolution of various issues related to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. This is of great significance in Asian history and was unimaginable in the era of imperialism's rule over Asia. The holding of the Asian Countries Conference itself symbolizes the further strengthening of friendship and unity among the Asian people and marks the Asian people's love of peace and their determination to defend peace.

    Asia's population accounts for more than half of the world's population. Imperialists have always regarded Asia's rich human resources as targets for their exploitation and plunder, and have used them as a source of troops and reserves for aggression. But now the Asian people have awakened. The Asian people are breaking free from the colonial shackles of imperialism and taking their destiny into their own hands. Some have already achieved independence, and others are on the road to independence. Maintaining their independence and security, and building their own beautiful and happy life, is the common aspiration of the awakened Asian people. The Asian people are increasingly aware that to realize these aspirations, they must oppose war and safeguard peace. This ardent desire for peace is making the Asian people appear on the historical stage as a new and great force for peace. The Asian Countries Conference is to further strengthen the unity and understanding between the Asian people, so that the Asian peace forces can play a more powerful role in easing international tensions and consolidating peace in Asia and the world.

    For this reason, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have become the first item on the agenda of the Asian Countries Conference. The Five Principles, which advocate mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, are widely welcomed by all countries that are willing to maintain their own independence and development, and are also willing to respect the independence and development of other countries. For Asian countries, the realization of the Five Principles is of more immediate interest. Because if the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence can be realized, Asian countries will be able to maintain and achieve their own independence, unite and cooperate on the basis of non-interference from outside, and achieve economic and cultural prosperity and development in a peaceful environment. The agenda of the Asian Countries Conference includes four aspects: political, economic, cultural, and scientific. The entire agenda runs through the Asian people's demand for the realization of the Five Principles and reflects the struggles currently faced by the Asian people in their efforts to safeguard peace and strive for and consolidate independence. From the agenda, it can be seen that the Asian people are making great efforts in this broad and complex struggle.

    The people of Asian countries have made great contributions to defending peace, striving for and consolidating independence. In the great movement to strive for world peace, the Asian people have always actively stood at the forefront of this team with a new, vigorous, and magnificent spirit. Their struggle against war, against colonial enslavement, and against atomic weapons wars has promoted the widespread development of the peace movement. The achievements of the 1952 Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference are a notable proof. Asian countries are also striving to enhance mutual understanding and friendly cooperation. The mutual visits of the Prime Ministers of China and India, China and Burma, and the Prime Ministers of other Asian countries, the Five Principles advocated by Asian countries, the joint declaration of the Chinese and Soviet governments, and the joint communiqué of the Prime Ministers of India and Egypt, have greatly promoted the consolidation of peace in Asia. China, India, and other Asian countries of the Colombo Conference have made important contributions to the peaceful settlement of some major international issues in Asia, such as the Korean issue and the Indochina issue. Recently, at the initiative of the Colombo countries, twenty-nine Asian and African countries will soon hold the Asian-African Conference in Indonesia to seek to enhance and establish mutual understanding and friendly relations. These efforts by Asian countries and their people have greatly enhanced the international prestige of Asian countries, demonstrated the increasingly important position and role of the Asian people in world affairs, and inspired and strengthened the world people's confidence and strength in striving for peace.

    However, the American aggressor bloc, because it wants to seize world hegemony, is deeply afraid and hates these efforts of the Asian people, and uses various methods to obstruct and undermine them. It is doing its utmost to undermine peace and prepare for war. The United States is obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea, undermining the Geneva Accords, and attempting to keep Korea and Indochina permanently divided. It is infringing on the independence of Asian countries, interfering in their internal affairs, and establishing American military bases on their territories. It is organizing aggressive military blocs in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, creating division and antagonism among Asian countries, and engaging in provocations and discord in order to prepare for new wars. In order to force the Asian people to submit to the will of the United States and act as tools of American aggression, the United States arrogantly flaunts its "strength" and clamors to use atomic weapons in Asia. At the same time, the United States has expressed its willingness to cooperate with Asian countries in the so-called peaceful use of atomic energy, which the United States itself has not carried out, in an attempt to deceive Asian countries and take the opportunity to plunder Asian atomic raw materials.

    This behavior of the American aggressor bloc has created tension and the threat of war in Asia, aroused great indignation among the Asian people, and has been resisted in many places. The Asian people resolutely oppose American colonialism, demand a ban on the use of atomic weapons, and resolutely advocate that atomic energy be used for peaceful purposes. The signature campaign demanding a ban on the use of atomic weapons is vigorously unfolding throughout Asia.

    The American behavior of undermining peace is particularly blatant in its occupation of China's territory Taiwan. The United States interferes in China's internal affairs and openly uses the threat of war to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. After occupying Taiwan, the United States has become even more greedy, attempting to occupy the coastal islands, and has undisguisedly expressed its intention to attack the Chinese mainland. At the same time, the United States is playing the trick of a "ceasefire", attempting to create so-called "two Chinas" with the conditions of withdrawing from the coastal islands and assisting Britain in protecting its colonial interests in the Far East, luring Britain and some Commonwealth countries, and dragging them into participating in the aggression against China. This blatant act of aggression by the United States has made the situation in the Taiwan area extremely tense and seriously threatens peace in Asia and the world. In order to defend peace and maintain its independence, the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and resolutely demand that the American aggressor forces withdraw from the Taiwan area.

    The Asian people demand the establishment of normal economic and cultural exchanges between countries in order to enhance mutual understanding and cooperation, break away from their dependence on imperialist countries, and develop their own economies and cultures. Based on this common demand, Asian countries have signed many economic and trade agreements, and mutual visits of trade delegations have become increasingly frequent. Expos have been held in many Asian countries to promote mutual trade. Asian countries have also dispatched various cultural delegations, art troupes, and social groups to visit and learn from each other. These visits have been greatly welcomed and have greatly strengthened the unity and friendship between the Asian people.

    However, the United States attempts to hang an iron curtain between Asian countries, obstructing and undermining economic and cultural exchanges between them. The United States forces Asian countries to implement embargoes and restrictions, hindering their trade with China, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries. The United States is trying to control the economies of Asian countries, turning them into markets for dumping American surplus products. At the same time, the United States uses its monopoly position in the capitalist world market to lower the prices of raw materials produced by Asian countries, causing them huge losses. Even Japan, which has a considerable industrial base, has suffered huge trade deficits with the United States due to the American embargo policy. This selfish policy of the United States is being met with increasingly strong opposition from the Asian people.

    All of this shows that what forms the current Asian situation are two opposing basic factors: on the one hand, the Asian people who have broken free from colonial oppression and are breaking free; on the other hand, the imperialists, led by the American aggressor bloc, who are trying to maintain and expand their colonial rule. This is a struggle between nascent forces and dying forces, between peace and war. The American aggressor bloc is attempting to use all means to prepare to launch wars of aggression in order to continue enslaving the Asian people. And the Asian people must use all their strength to defend peace in order to maintain their independence, freedom and security.

    It is clear that the discussion of all these aspects of the struggle at the Asian Countries Conference will greatly strengthen the Asian people's victorious confidence in defending peace and promote the peace movement in Asia and the world. The Asian people are industrious and brave people. As long as the Asian people are united, shoulder the cause of defending peace, and persevere to the end, peace can be maintained and the war schemes of the American aggressor bloc can be defeated. The Chinese people will be closely united with all the people of Asia to work together to defend peace in Asia and the world.

    欢迎亚洲国家会议
    亚洲人民热烈要求的亚洲国家会议从今天起在印度德里开会。这是亚洲人民为了和平而举行的一次重大集会。出席会议的有来自十八个国家的约二百二十五名代表。这些代表是从各国的不同阶层的人民中产生的。因此，这个会议具有广泛的代表性。代表们将就有关亚洲人民利益的共同问题，特别是和平共处的五项原则，自由交换意见。这个会议对于反对战争、保卫和平，对于增进亚洲人民之间的友好和团结，加强亚洲各国人民之间的联系，将会发生极大的作用。这是有利于缓和目前远东和国际的紧张局势、巩固亚洲和世界和平的。中国人民衷心欢迎这个会议，祝贺会议得到满意的成就。
    亚洲各国进行会议筹备工作的情形，证明亚洲各国人民和公众舆论对这个会议十分重视。印度的一百多名国会议员和省立法会议的议员参加了筹备工作。印度各地群众也纷纷举行了支持亚洲国家会议的集会。日本的许多著名人士，包括前首相片山哲和现任通商产业相石桥湛山在内，都支持这个会议。黎巴嫩的“生活报”和“消息报”发表评论，希望会议将表达阿拉伯人民的深切愿望，并改善亚洲国家之间的关系。这反映了中东人民对于会议的重视。中国、苏联、蒙古人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国的人民都对会议作了充分的准备，极为重视会议在巩固亚洲和世界和平中所起的作用。
    亚洲人民重视亚洲国家会议，是十分自然的事情。因为会议提供了这样的一个机会，使亚洲国家的和平代表们得以聚会一堂，自由地交换意见，以求集中亚洲各国人民的智慧和力量，对促进有关保障亚洲和世界和平的各项问题的解决作出贡献。这在亚洲历史上是有着巨大意义的，是在帝国主义统治亚洲的时代所不能想像的。举行亚洲国家会议本身就象征着亚洲各国人民友好和团结的进一步加强，标志着亚洲人民热爱和平和坚决保卫和平的意志。
    亚洲的人口占全世界人口一半以上。帝国主义者一向把亚洲的丰富的人力资源当作它剥削掠夺的对象，并且拿来作为进行侵略的兵力来源和后备力量。但是现在亚洲人民已经觉醒过来了。亚洲人民正在挣脱帝国主义的殖民镣铐，把自己的命运掌握在自己手里。他们有的已经取得了独立，有的正在走上独立的道路。维护自己的独立和安全，建设自己的美好幸福的生活，这是觉醒了的亚洲人民的共同愿望。亚洲人民越来越认识到，要实现这些愿望，就必须反对战争，保卫和平。这种对于和平的热望，使亚洲人民正在作为一支新兴的伟大的和平力量出现在历史舞台上。亚洲国家会议就是为了进一步加强亚洲人民之间的团结和了解，使亚洲的和平力量在和缓国际紧张局势、巩固亚洲和世界和平的斗争中发挥更强大的作用。
    正因为如此，所以和平共处的五项原则成为亚洲国家会议讨论的第一项议程。主张互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则，受到一切愿意维护自己的独立和发展、并且也愿意尊重别国的独立和发展的国家的广泛欢迎。对于亚洲国家来说，实现五项原则更具有切身的利害关系。因为能够实现和平共处的五项原则，亚洲国家就能够维护和取得自己的独立，就能够在不受外来干涉的基础上团结合作，就能够在和平的环境中取得经济上和文化上的繁荣和发展。亚洲国家会议的议程包括政治、经济、文化和科学等四个方面。全部议程贯穿着亚洲人民对于实现五项原则的要求，反映了亚洲人民目前在保卫和平、争取和巩固独立的努力中所面临的斗争。从议程中可以看出，亚洲人民在这个广泛而复杂的斗争中正在作出巨大的努力。
    为了保卫和平、争取和巩固独立，亚洲各国人民作出了巨大的贡献。在争取世界和平的伟大运动中，亚洲人民总是以新兴的奋发的雄壮气概积极地站在这个队伍的前列。他们的反对战争、反对殖民主义奴役、反对原子武器战争的斗争，推动着和平运动的广泛发展。一九五二年亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的成就，就是一个显著的证明。亚洲国家之间也在力求增进互相了解和友好合作。中印、中缅总理以及亚洲其他各国的总理们的相互访问，亚洲国家所倡导的五项原则，中苏两国政府的联合宣言，印度和埃及总理的联合公报，都大大促进了亚洲和平的巩固。对于亚洲的某些重大国际问题的和平解决，例如朝鲜问题和印度支那问题，中国、印度和科伦坡会议的其他亚洲国家都曾经作了重要的贡献。最近，由于科伦坡国家的倡议，二十九个亚非国家即将在印度尼西亚举行亚非会议，谋求增进和建立相互间的谅解和友好关系。亚洲国家和它们的人民的这些努力，大大提高了亚洲国家的国际威信，显示了亚洲人民在世界事务中日益重要的地位和作用，鼓舞和增强了世界人民争取和平的信心和力量。
    但是美国侵略集团由于想夺取世界霸权，深深害怕和仇视亚洲人民的这些努力，用种种方法来加以阻挠和破坏。它竭力破坏和平，准备战争。美国阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，破坏日内瓦协议，企图使朝鲜和印度支那永远陷于分裂局面。它侵犯亚洲国家的独立，干涉它们的内政，在它们领土上建立美国的军事基地。它在东南亚和中东组织侵略性的军事集团，在亚洲国家中间制造分裂和对立，进行挑拨离间，以便准备新的战争。为了迫使亚洲人民顺从美国的意志，充当美国的侵略工具，美国狂妄地炫耀“实力”，叫嚣要在亚洲使用原子武器。同时，美国又表示愿意用美国自己都没有进行的所谓和平利用原子能来和亚洲国家合作，企图欺骗亚洲国家，乘机掠夺亚洲的原子原料。
    美国侵略集团的这种行为在亚洲造成了紧张局势和战争威胁，激起了亚洲人民的极大愤慨，并在许多地方遭到了反抗。亚洲人民坚决反对美国的殖民主义，要求禁止使用原子武器，坚决主张把原子能用于和平的目的。要求禁止使用原子武器的签名运动正在全亚洲蓬勃展开。
    美国破坏和平的行为特别露骨地表现在侵占中国的领土台湾上。美国干涉中国内政，公然用战争威胁来阻挠中国人民解放台湾。在侵占台湾以后，美国又得寸进尺，企图侵占沿海岛屿，并且毫不掩饰地表示要进攻中国大陆。与此同时，美国又玩弄“停火”的诡计，企图用所谓撤出沿海岛屿和协助英国保护它在远东的殖民利益为条件，制造所谓“两个中国”，拉拢英国和某些英联邦国家，拖着它们参加对中国的侵略。美国这种明目张胆的侵略行为，使台湾地区的局势极为紧张，严重地威胁了亚洲和世界的和平。中国人民为了保卫和平，为了维护自己的独立，一定要解放台湾，并坚决要求美国侵略势力从台湾地区撤走。
    亚洲人民要求在各国之间建立正常的经济上和文化上的交流，以便增进相互之间的了解和合作，摆脱对帝国主义国家的附属地位，发展本国的经济和文化。基于这种共同的要求，亚洲国家之间签订了不少经济和贸易方面的协定，贸易代表团的相互访问也日益频繁。在好多亚洲国家里都举办了博览会，以促进相互间的贸易。亚洲国家之间还派遣了各种文化代表团、艺术团体和社会人士的访问团互相进行访问和学习。这种访问受到了极大的欢迎，并且大大加强了亚洲人民之间的团结和友好。
    但是美国却企图在亚洲国家之间挂上铁幕，阻挠和破坏它们之间经济上和文化上的交流。美国强迫亚洲国家实行封锁禁运，阻挠它们同中国、苏联以及人民民主国家进行贸易。美国竭力企图控制亚洲国家的经济，把它们变为倾销美国过剩产品的市场。同时美国利用它在资本主义世界市场上的垄断地位，压低亚洲国家出产的原料的价格，使它们遭受巨大的损失。即如有相当工业基础的日本，也由于美国的禁运政策而造成对美国的巨额贸易逆差。美国这种损人利己的政策，正在遭到亚洲人民越来越强烈的反对。
    所有这一切说明，形成今天亚洲局势的是这样两个对立的基本因素：一方面是从殖民压迫下挣脱出来的和正在挣脱的亚洲人民，另一方面是以美国侵略集团为首的、力图维持和扩展自己殖民统治的帝国主义者。这是新生的力量和垂死的力量之间的斗争，是和平和战争之间的斗争。美国侵略集团企图用一切手段来准备发动侵略战争，以达到继续奴役亚洲人民的目的。而亚洲人民要以一切力量来保卫和平，以维护自己的独立自由和安全。
    很明显，亚洲国家会议对于所有这些斗争方面的讨论，将会大大加强亚洲人民保卫和平的胜利信心，推进亚洲和世界的和平运动。亚洲人民是勤劳勇敢的人民，只要亚洲人民团结一致，把保卫和平的事业担当起来，并且把它坚持到底，和平就可以得到维护，美国侵略集团的战争阴谋就可以被击败。中国人民将和全亚洲人民亲密团结，一起为捍卫亚洲和世界的和平而努力。
