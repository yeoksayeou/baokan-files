Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 1st - According to information from the Indian Information Bureau: Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a foreign policy speech in the Indian Parliament's People's Assembly on March 31st.

    Nehru said that an affirmative symbol of Asia's rise is the upcoming Asian-African Conference in Bandung. He said, "I certainly believe that this conference has some significance. It is unique. The fact that representatives of 1.4 billion people are meeting there is something of extremely important historical significance; this has never happened before."

    Nehru said, "It used to be common practice for the affairs of Asia to be decided by some great powers in Europe. But now the opinions of Asian countries are being given some weight, because they cannot be ignored. Nevertheless, it seems to external countries that it is their noble privilege to take the burden of Asia upon their shoulders. Decisions concerning Asia were made without Asia having much say in them. But obviously things have changed."

    Nehru pointed out that the Asian-African Conference is not against anyone, neither against Europe nor against the Americas. "It is merely a gathering of Asian and African countries whose purpose is two-fold: peace and opportunities for development. There is a strong call for peace all over the world, and even more so in Asian and African countries. Everyone has a desire for freedom and peace, and this is the common link between these countries."

    Nehru also said that one of the disturbing factors is the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. He said, "It seems very strange to emphasize various military alliances and treaties, especially in Southeast Asia, West Asia, and elsewhere, in the name of security and peace. The situation in the Indochina countries after the Geneva Conference was promising and good. Then out of nowhere came an attempt, supposedly through some military treaty or alliance, to ensure the security and peace of Southeast Asia, and the foundation for this treaty or alliance was laid in Manila... I now think it is very clear that the Manila Treaty and the Bangkok Conference have overturned any previous notions of peace or any concept of security that existed in that region. The whole concept of the Geneva Conference was co-existence." Speaking about the Indochina issue, Nehru said that the only solution is for the great powers to agree to let the Indochina countries manage their own affairs. The great powers should recognize their freedom and not interfere with their independence.

    Nehru said, "Regarding the situation in Taiwan, as far as India is concerned, there can obviously only be one general attitude towards this issue, and this attitude arises from the recognition of the People's Republic of China. But there is very broad agreement on an obvious fact: the islands of Matsu and Quemoy off the mainland coast are certainly part of the mainland. The presence of any hostile forces there will constantly cause anger and danger. Countries that are unfriendly to the Chinese People's Government have at least acknowledged this. However, other forces continue to occupy these islands. It is said that if the Chinese government attacks these islands, the full power of that powerful country will be used to defend them, because it is said that they may involve the security of that great power. This is a very unusual practice. These islands logically and reasonably certainly belong to the Chinese mainland."

    In discussing the military alliances currently being organized in the Middle East, Nehru said that these alliances are worsening the situation. These military agreements not only do not help in the slightest but are causing great harm; far from bringing guarantees of security and peace. Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, and possibly some other countries, are strongly opposed to this practice. As a result, the Middle East has been divided into hostile camps. After pointing out that the Syrian government and other governments are resisting pressure to join military agreements, Nehru said, "I hope they will resist; too much has been done under pressure, threats, and other means of intimidation."

    Nehru said that the situation in Southeast Asia, the Far East, and West Asia is that, on the one hand, people see Asia reviving and Asia awakening; on the other hand, various schemes are being carried out in the name of helping Asia and maintaining peace in Asia, creating discord and conflict. He said that we must not view this situation with a complacent attitude.

    Nehru said that the Five Principles are a challenge that Asia has put to the rest of the world. "Every country must give a straightforward answer to this challenge. I hope that the Asian-African Conference will raise this issue straightforwardly and unequivocally, and ask every country to state whether it is in favor of non-aggression and non-interference."

### 尼赫鲁总理在印度人民院发表外交演说

    尼赫鲁总理在印度人民院发表外交演说
    新华社新德里一日电　据印度新闻处消息：印度总理尼赫鲁三月三十一日在印度国会人民院发表外交演说。
    尼赫鲁说，作为亚洲兴起的一个肯定的象征就是即将在万隆举行的亚非会议。他说：“我肯定认为这个会议具有某种重要意义。它是独一无二的。十四亿人民的代表在那里举行会议这一事实就是一种具有极其重要历史意义的事情，以前从来没有过这种事情。”
    尼赫鲁说：“亚洲的事务由欧洲的一些大国决定曾经是习以为常的事。但是现在亚洲国家的意见已经受到一些重视，因为对它们不予理会是不行的。尽管如此，看来外部的国家把亚洲的担子挑在肩上似乎是它们的崇高的特权。有关亚洲的决定作出了，而亚洲在其中没有什么发言权。但是，显然事情已经改变了。”
    尼赫鲁指出，亚非会议不反对任何人，既不反对欧洲，也不反对美洲。“它仅仅是亚非国家的集会，这些国家的目的有两个：和平和发展的机会。在全世界各地有一种要求和平的强烈呼声，在亚非国家更其如此。大家有着要求自由和和平的愿望，这是这些国家的共同联系。”
    尼赫鲁又说，令人不安的因素之一是东南亚条约组织。他说：“以安全和和平的名义特别强调在东南亚、西亚和其他地方的各种军事联盟和条约似乎是很离奇的。印度支那各国在日内瓦会议以后的情况是有希望的和良好的。然后凭空出现了据说是通过某种军事条约或联盟以确保东南亚的安全和和平的尝试，这种条约或联盟的基础是在马尼拉奠定的……我现在觉得很清楚，马尼拉条约和曼谷会议已经推翻了先前在那个地区存在的任何和平观念，或任何安全概念。日内瓦会议的整个概念是共处。”尼赫鲁谈到印度支那问题时说，唯一的解决办法就是大国应该同意让印度支那各国自己行事。大国应该承认它们的自由，并且不干涉它们的独立。
    尼赫鲁说：“关于台湾局势，就印度而言，显然只能有一种对待这个问题的一般态度，这种态度是由于承认中华人民共和国而产生的。但是在一件明显的事实上有十分广泛的一致意见：大陆沿岸的马祖岛和金门岛肯定是大陆的一部分。那里有了任何敌对的军队，都会经常引起愤怒和危险。对中国人民政府不友好的国家也至少已承认了这一点。然而其他部队仍旧继续占领着这些岛屿。据说如果中国政府进攻这些岛屿的话，那个有力量的国家的全部力量将用来保卫它们，因为据说它们可能牵涉到那个大国的安全。这是非常异乎寻常的做法。这些岛屿按逻辑、按道理完全肯定将归于中国大陆。”
    在谈到现在正在中东组织的军事联盟时，尼赫鲁说，这些联盟使局势变得恶化。这些军事协定不但丝毫没有帮助，而且正在造成巨大的祸害，它远没有带来安全和和平的保证。埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯和也门，可能还有某些其他国家，对这种做法是十分反对的。结果中东已经分裂成敌对的阵营。尼赫鲁在指出叙利亚政府和其他政府正在抵抗要它们参加军事协定的压力之后说：“我希望它们将进行抵抗，在压力、威胁和其他恫吓手段之下做成的事情太多了。”
    尼赫鲁说，东南亚、远东和西亚的局势是，一方面，人们看到亚洲在复兴，亚洲在觉醒，另一方面，有人在帮助亚洲、保持亚洲和平的名义下进行着各式各样的图谋，制造不和和冲突。他说，我们决不能以很满意的心情，看待这种情况。
    尼赫鲁说，五项原则是亚洲向世界其他地区提出的挑战。“每一个国家都必须对这种挑战给予直接了当的回答。我希望亚非会议将直接了当、毫不含糊地提出这个问题来，并要求每一个国家都说明它是不是赞成互不侵略、互不干涉。”
