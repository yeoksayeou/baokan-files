　　Shijingshan Power Plant carried out its staffing quota work over two months, starting in mid-August last year. Through the implementation of staffing quotas, non-industrial production personnel and management personnel were reduced, production departments were strengthened, and labor was allocated more rationally. At the end of last year, the Shijingshan Power Plant, based on the staffing quotas, further calculated detailed accounts and formulated a more advanced labor plan for this year. Facts over the past few months have proven that due to the streamlining of management organizations, the relatively reasonable adjustment of labor organization, the establishment of systems, and the clarification of responsibilities, labor productivity has been improved and equipment accidents have been reduced. Furthermore, some personnel were transferred to support new construction units.

　　From 1951, the Shijingshan Power Plant did not increase its production equipment, but it continuously increased personnel, especially non-industrial production personnel and management personnel. There was a general idea among cadres that "more people make things easier." For example, although the number of personnel in the Materials Supply Section was more than double the actual need, the section chief still felt that there were not enough people and requested an increase. The result of implementing the staffing quota work was that the section was reduced from 35 people to 18, and the work was done better than before. Before the staffing quotas, the Materials Supply Section had no procurement plan, no material management system, and unclear personnel responsibilities. For example, materials were purchased whenever they were needed, and personnel were sent to buy them. Procurement personnel sometimes went to Beijing city with only one or two material lists to buy goods, wasting a lot of manpower and often making mistakes. After the staffing quotas, due to the establishment of a procurement plan, although the number of procurement personnel was reduced, the phenomena of chaos and errors were reduced instead. Among the more than 5,000 kinds of materials managed by the Materials Supply Section, only more than 1,000 kinds were actually commonly used, and only more than 200 material slips were issued daily. The five material storage groups and thirteen storekeepers handled an average of less than 20 material slips per person per day, but due to unclear responsibilities and the lack of a material management system, errors often occurred. After the implementation of staffing quotas, strict regulations were established for material requisition, return, and material management, giving full play to the work enthusiasm of the storekeepers. Now, the number of storekeepers has been reduced from more than a dozen to six. Everyone often studies the work and has absorbed the experience of the "double-sided label inventory method" of the Materials Supply Section of the Tangshan Electric Power Administration, basically achieving consistency between accounts and materials, and overcoming the chaotic phenomenon of warehouse management.

　　Before the staffing quotas, the General Affairs Section had the most redundant personnel in the Shijingshan Power Plant. At its peak, this section accounted for more than one-fifth of the total number of employees in the plant. The head of the General Affairs Section believed that: General affairs work is bottomless, wherever there is work, you have to go there, and it is impossible without a lot of people. He often said: "There is no one who idles around here, even if there is nothing to do, isn't sweeping the floor and cleaning the yard also work!" Therefore, in the past, the General Affairs Section had a "hygiene team" composed of more than a dozen people, who, in addition to cleaning the yard, were also responsible for moving tables and chairs for meetings. In the past, office desks, stools, and bookshelves in the plant were hired by temporary workers to make in the plant. The head of the General Affairs Section said: "The styles bought outside are not suitable, it is better to make our own economically." Therefore, the civil engineering and repair team led by the General Affairs Section had more than 30 carpenters alone (including temporary workers). In this General Affairs Section, there were many redundant personnel and many sick personnel (in the past, many sick personnel were sent to work in the General Affairs Section), so the work efficiency was very low. The staffing quota work made the head of the General Affairs Section clear-headed. He said: "This is a new change in my years of doing general affairs work, which makes me begin to realize the importance of rationally organizing labor and improving work efficiency." After the implementation of staffing quotas, the General Affairs Section formulated personnel responsibility regulations and improved the work system. Although the number of personnel has been reduced by more than half, the work efficiency has been improved.

　　Before the staffing quotas, many departments in the Shijingshan Power Plant had unreasonable phenomena of overstaffing. Responsibilities were unclear, procedures were complicated, and the management system was not sound. In the production workshop, there were also surplus and inappropriate allocation of labor. Taking the situation of the auxiliary workshop repair shop in the second quarter of last year as an example, the effective production time was only 75%; the thermal engineering room had one person in charge of the coal meter, working only ten days a month, and one person in charge of seven carbon dioxide meters, working only two days a week. Some important production positions had insufficient personnel, while secondary production positions had too many personnel. Therefore, although the planned total output value of this plant in 1954 was 7.94% higher than that in 1953, the labor productivity was only 98.25% of that in 1953.

　　After the staffing quotas, the labor organization was adjusted, the responsibilities of personnel at all levels were clearly defined, the responsibility regulations were revised, and the methods of "positioning, quantification, and quality determination" were adopted to implement the principle of vigorously reducing non-industrial production personnel and management personnel, strengthening production forces, and rationally allocating labor. More than 17% of the personnel were reduced, of which non-industrial production personnel were reduced by 47.5%. Most of these personnel were reasonably placed, of which more than 67% of the technicians, young workers, technical personnel, and personnel with certain work abilities were sent to new or expanded power plants, or transferred to basic construction training personnel. Old workers over the age of 60 retired in accordance with the labor insurance regulations. Within the workshop, the labor force was also adjusted. For example, the boiler workshop, according to the increase in power generation and the lengthening of the burning time of the low-pressure furnace, needed to increase shifts, and the original personnel allocation was insufficient. The workshop leadership reduced the surplus stoker assistants in the pulverized coal furnace and high-pressure furnace, and strengthened the production personnel allocation of the low-pressure furnace. The steam turbine plant, which is responsible for mechanical maintenance and safe operation, has improved the quality of its work, even though the number of personnel has been reduced by 22%. In the past, the workers in the steam turbine plant generally believed that: more people, more accidents, and more rework during maintenance. In the past, the overhaul of a certain main turbine often delayed the date due to rework. Now, because the technical responsibility system has been strengthened and the workers have strengthened labor discipline, although ten maintenance personnel have been reduced, in the most recent overhaul of a certain main turbine, not only was there no delay, but the task was completed two hours ahead of schedule. Among the workers transferred from the steam turbine plant, about half were veteran technicians of level four or above, and some of them were rated as advanced producers after arriving at the new power plant.

　　After the Shijingshan Power Plant implemented the staffing quotas on the basis of strengthening planned management, industrial production personnel accounted for more than 90% of the total number of employees in the plant, and labor productivity has been significantly improved. The labor productivity in 1954 was 12% higher than the original plan. The labor productivity plan for this year is 12.74% higher than the actual performance in 1954. In the first quarter of this year, the power generation exceeded the state plan by 6.67%, the total output value exceeded by 4.56%, and the labor productivity was 9.7% higher than the state plan. Equipment accidents have been reduced. There were no major accidents in February this year, and there was only one ordinary accident in March. Due to the reduction of personnel, the savings in the wage fund are about 100,000 yuan per year.

　　At the end of last year, the Shijingshan Power Plant formulated the 1955 labor plan on the basis of the staffing quotas. After repeated detailed calculations, the number of management personnel was reduced by seven, non-industrial production personnel were reduced by fifteen, and repair workers were reduced by five. In terms of maintenance, according to the amount of maintenance work required this year and the number of people needed, it is possible to balance and produce 17 maintenance workers.

　　Although the Shijingshan Power Plant has undergone repeated compression of staffing and has achieved certain results, the current staffing quota has not yet reached a completely reasonable level. If the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of employees are further brought into play and attention is paid to cultivating technical talents, more labor can be saved to support new construction units. This shows that the potential strength within our enterprises is very great.

    石景山发电厂进行定员工作前后
    本报记者　葛娴
    北京石景山发电厂从去年八月中旬开始，用了两个月时间，进行了定员工作。经过定员，缩减了非工业生产人员和管理人员，充实了生产部门，比较合理地配备了劳动力。去年年底，石景山发电厂又在定员的基础上，进一步算了细账，制定了今年比较先进的劳动计划。几个月来的事实证明：由于精简了管理机构，比较合理地调整了劳动组织，订立了制度，分清了职责，因此提高了劳动生产率，减少了设备事故。并且还输送一部分人员支援了新建单位。
    从一九五一年起，石景山发电厂没有增加生产设备，但却不断地增加人员，特别是非工业生产人员和管理人员。在干部中普遍存在“人多好办事”的思想，例如，材料供应科的人员虽然较实际需要多了一倍，但是科长却还嫌人员不够，要求增加人；实行定员工作的结果，这个科由原来三十五个人减少到十八个人，工作反比以前做得好了。在定员前，材料供应科采购没有计划，保管材料没有制度，人员职责不清。如采购材料是随时要货随时派人买，采购员有时进北京城只带上一、二张料单买货，浪费人力很大，还常出差错。定员后，由于订立了采购计划，虽然减少了采购员，忙乱、差错现象反减少了。材料供应科经管的五千多种材料中，实际常用的只有一千多种，每日领发料的只有二百多张料单，五个材料保管组和十三个保管员，每人每天平均经手不到二十张料单的工作量，但因职责不清，没有材料保管制度，经常发生差错。实行定员后，严格规定了领料、退料和材料保管等制度，发挥了保管员的工作积极性。现在，保管员已由十多个人减少到六个人，大家经常研究工作，吸收了唐山电业管理局材料供应工作“双面标签盘点法”的经验，基本上达到了帐料相符，克服了仓库管理的混乱现象。
    石景山发电厂在定员前，冗员最多的是总务科。这个科在人数最多时要占全厂职工总人数的五分之一以上，总务科长认为：干总务工作是没底的，那里有活，就得往那里去，没有很多的人是不行的。他常说：“在我们这里，没有吃闲饭的人，再没有事干，扫扫地、清理清理院子不也是活吗！”所以，过去总务科里有由十多个人组成的“卫生队”，他们除了清理院子之外，就是专门搬开会用的桌子、凳子。过去，厂内的办公桌、凳、书柜都雇临时工来厂里做，总务科长说：“外面买的式样不合适，不如自己做的经济”。于是，总务科领导的土木修缮组中，单木工就有三十多人（连临时工在内）。在这个总务科里，冗员多、病号多（过去许多有病的人员都送到总务科去工作），因此工作效率很低。定员的工作使这位总务科长的脑子清醒了过来。他说：“这是我做总务工作几年来的新变化，使我开始认识到要合理组织劳动力和提高工作效率的重要性。”实行定员后，总务科制定了人员的职责条例，改进了工作制度。人员虽减少了一多半，却提高了工作效率。
    石景山发电厂在定员前，许多科室都存在人浮于事的不合理现象。职责不明、手续繁杂、管理制度也不健全。在生产车间，劳动力也有多余和调配不当的现象。以辅助车间修理场去年第二季度的情况看，有效的生产时间只有百分之七十五；热工室一人管煤表，一个月只做十天工作，一个人管七个二氧化碳表，一星期只做二天工作。有的重要生产岗位人员不够，次要的生产岗位却人员过多。因此，这个厂一九五四年计划总产值虽比一九五三年提高百分之七点九四，而劳动生产率却仅为一九五三年的百分之九十八点二五。
    经过定员，调整了劳动组织，明确规定了各级人员的职责，修订了职责条例，采取“定位、定量、定质”的方法，贯彻大力缩减非工业生产人员和管理人员，充实生产力量和合理配备劳动力的原则，减去了百分之十七以上的人员，其中非工业生产人员减少了百分之四十七点五。这些人员大部分都得到了合理的安置，其中有百分之六十七以上的技工、青工、技术人员和有一定工作能力的人员，都送到了新建或扩建电厂，或转为基本建设培养人员。年满六十岁以上的老工人按照劳动保险条例规定退休了。在车间内部，也调整了劳动力。如锅炉车间根据发电量增加、低压炉烧的时间加长的情况，需要增加班次，原来的人员配备不足，车间领导上就减少煤粉炉、高压炉多余的司炉助手，充实了低压炉的生产人员配备。负责机械检修和安全运行的汽机场，人数虽然减少了百分之二十二，工作质量反而提高了。过去，汽机场工人普遍认为：人多、事故多、检修返工多。过去检修某主力汽机，常因返工而拖延日期，现在因为加强了技术责任制度，工人加强了劳动纪律，虽然减少了十个检修人员，但是在最近一次检修某主力汽机时，不但没有延期，并且提前两小时完成了任务。在汽机场调出的工人中，有一半左右是四级以上的老技工，他们有的到了新建电厂以后，还被评为先进生产者。
    石景山发电厂在加强计划管理的基础上，实行定员以后，工业生产人员已占全厂总人数的百分之九十以上，劳动生产率有了显著提高，一九五四年劳动生产率已比原计划提高了百分之十二。今年劳动生产率计划又比一九五四年实绩要提高百分之十二点七四。今年第一季度发电量超额百分之六点六七完成国家计划，总产值超额百分之四点五六，劳动生产率比国家计划提高了百分之九点七。设备事故减少了，今年二月份已没有发生重要事故，三月份只有一次普通事故。由于人员的减少，节约工资基金全年约十万元。
    去年年底，石景山发电厂在定员的基础上制定了一九五五年的劳动计划。经过反复算细账，管理人员又减少了七人，非工业生产人员减少了十五人，修理工减少了五人。在检修方面，根据今年需要检修的工作量和所需人数进行平衡，还可平衡出检修工十七人。
    石景山发电厂虽然经过一次再次的压缩编制，并已获得了一定成绩；但是，现在的人员定额还是没有达到完全合理的程度，如果进一步发挥广大职工的积极性和创造性，重视培养技术人材，还可以节约出更多的劳动力来支援新建单位。这说明我们企业内部的潜在力量是很大的。
