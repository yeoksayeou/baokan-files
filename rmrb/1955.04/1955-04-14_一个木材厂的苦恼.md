A Lumber Mill's Troubles
	Liao Yulong
	The Guanghua Lumber Mill in Beijing is a modern door and window processing factory equipped with advanced machinery. Based on its machine production capacity, it can produce more than 150,000 sets of general doors and windows annually. However, the design departments do not pay attention to the standard door and window design, but create new styles, blindly increasing the style and specifications of doors and windows, which seriously affects the production of the factory. Taking 1954 as an example, the designs of doors and windows for buildings such as the Western Suburbs Guesthouse, the Di'anmen Dormitory, the Beijing Hotel, the Xinqiao Hotel, and the Beijing Medical College, designed by the Central Design Institute and the Beijing Construction Engineering Bureau Design Institute, totaled more than 1,000 kinds. Although there are many styles and specifications of doors and windows, the processing quantity of each type is very small, and some are even one style for each item. Because there is no unified style specification, the number of modifications and rework is very high, which brings many difficulties to the factory.
	First of all, the production efficiency of the factory is greatly reduced. For example, it only takes 0.4 work hours to make an ordinary plywood door, but it takes 24.22 work hours to make a latticed door. Therefore, only 50,000 sets of doors and windows were made last year, and the utilization rate of mechanical equipment was only 42%. On the other hand, in order to complete the task, it was necessary to recruit a group of manual carpenters.
	The lack of standard door and window designs makes it impossible for the factory to industrialize production. There is no work to do in the off-season, and the task has to be rushed in the peak season. This has become the most troublesome old problem of the Guanghua Lumber Mill. However, even in the peak season, there are not so many doors and windows to make. In order to avoid idling, the factory has to make furniture. Making doors and windows is different from making furniture. Making furniture requires more painters, but now we dare not recruit more painters, for fear that once a batch of door and window tasks is accepted, the furniture work will have to be stopped, and the recruited painters will have nothing to do. Therefore, we have to temporarily hire people from outside.
	The woodworking assembly is also greatly affected. Because making ordinary plywood doors only requires simple machine processing; but to make a door or window with many patterns, in addition to using machines, the whole piece of good wood has to be sawn into pieces for carving; long materials have to be shortened and reduced. In the drying process, the same specifications can be taken out as long as the moisture content of the wood can meet the standard requirements during drying, but because the specifications of the processed doors and windows are different and the quantity is too small, it is not possible to dry one specification at a time, and several specifications must be dried together. In this way, it is difficult to control the drying of long, short, thick, and thin wood in one furnace. If dried according to thin wood, the thick wood dried in the same furnace will not be thoroughly dried at that time. If the moisture content of the thick wood is too high, the finished doors and windows will be deformed over time. Conversely, if drying is based on the moisture content of thick plates meeting standard requirements, the drying time required will be greatly extended. For example, drying 50 mm thick Manchurian ash wood panels usually takes more than twice as long as drying 25 mm thick panels, which is very uneconomical.
	Due to the lack of standard door and window designs, it is not easy to accurately estimate the time required for the project. There is often a situation where one task is estimated to take one work hour, but the actual need is often two or three work hours. Because the work hour estimate is not accurate, the goods cannot be delivered according to the date of the contract signed with the owner, which affects the construction site's work plan. Moreover, factory production management is also difficult. One door and window is one style, and another door and window is another style. Therefore, it is impossible to fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, and the potential production force cannot be fully exploited, and production efficiency cannot be improved quickly.
	In 1952, the design department of the Ministry of Construction Engineering developed a set of standard door and window designs. At that time, the Guanghua Lumber Mill prefabricated a batch of doors and windows according to this standard design. However, the designers did not pay attention to this standard design, and the styles of doors and windows designed for the construction units were still bizarre patterns. The completed doors and windows could not be sold, and 1,200 sets of doors and windows slept in the factory warehouse for three years. Recently, a customer was found, and they were pushed out like clearing stagnant materials!
	The production situation of the Guanghua Lumber Mill is abnormal, and the comrades in the factory feel very distressed about this. Of course, the factory itself has many shortcomings, such as not good enough planning management, lack of experience, etc. However, this distress is mainly caused by designers creating new styles and blindly pursuing form. There are now some standard designs for doors and windows, but various civil engineering construction units are still unclear on how to rely on modern factories for processing, and are vigorously organizing and preparing construction site processing plants, making the Guanghua Lumber Mill have no work to do. Conversely, it is expected that after the engineering tension stage arrives, the Guanghua Lumber Mill will be unable to cope. Therefore, designers should correct their design thinking, proceed from the perspective of saving, promote various standard designs in construction, and create standard door and window design drawings. Civil engineering construction units should avoid decentralized production, so that the production of the Guanghua Lumber Mill can become regular and achieve planned and industrialized production.

    一个木材厂的苦恼
    廖玉龙
    北京市光华木材厂，是一个拥有近代化的新型机械设备的门窗加工厂。按它的机器生产能力计算，每年可生产一般门窗十五万樘以上。但是，由于设计机关不重视标准门窗设计，而是标新立异，一味增加门窗的式样和规格，严重地影响了这个工厂的生产。以一九五四年为例，由中央设计院和北京建筑工程局设计院所设计的西郊招待所、地安门宿舍、北京饭店、新侨饭店、北京医学院等建筑物的门窗的花样，总计就在一千种以上。门窗的规格和花样虽多，但每种的加工数量却很少，有的少到甚至一件活一个式样。由于没有统一的样式规格，修改、返工次数就很多，给工厂带来了许多困难。
    首先是大大降低了工厂的生产效率。例如，做一樘普通的夹板门只需要零点四个工，但做一樘花格门就要二十四点二二个工。因此，去年一年，只做了五万樘门窗，机械设备利用率只有百分之四十二；另一方面，为了完成任务，不得不招收一批手工木工。
    由于没有标准门窗设计，使工厂生产不能工厂化，淡季无工可做，旺季就突击赶任务，这已成了光华木材厂最苦恼的一个老问题了。但是，就是旺季有时也没有那样多的门窗可做，为了不窝工，厂里只好做家具。做门窗和做家具是不一样的，做家具就得有较多的油工，但现在又不敢多招油工，怕一旦接受一批门窗任务，家具的活就得停下来，招来的油工就无事可做，所以只得临时用临时向外请人。
    在木工装配上也受到很大影响。因为做普通的夹板门只需用机器简单的加工就可以了；但要做一樘带很多花样的门窗，除了使用机器外，整块的好木材还得锯成零星的来雕呀刻呀；长材整材不得不改短改小。在干燥时，同一个规格一炉，只要干燥时木材含水率能达到标准要求就可以取出，但，由于加工的门窗规格不一，数量又太少，不能一个规格一炉，必须几种规格一炉，这样长短厚薄的木材在一炉干燥时就很难掌握，如按照薄的木材去干燥，同炉干的厚木材到时就将干不透，厚的木材的含水率过高，将来制成的门窗日久就会变形；反之，如按厚板含水率达到标准要求干燥，那末，所需干燥的时间就大大的加长了。例如干燥五十公厘厚的水曲柳木板，通常就较二十五公厘厚的木板所需时间长一倍多，这样就非常不经济。
    由于没有标准门窗设计，对工程所需的时间的估计就不容易准确，经常有这样一种情况，一件活估计要一个工，但实际需要往往是两三个工，因为工时估计不准确，就不能按照同业主签订合同的日期交货，也因而影响了工地工作计划。并且，工厂的生产管理上也很困难，这樘门窗一个样，另一樘门窗又一个样，因此就不可能充分发挥工人们的积极性和创造性，生产潜在力量就不能充分发掘出来，生产效率就不能很快提高。
    一九五二年，建筑工程部的设计部门曾搞过一套标准门窗设计，当时，光华木材厂照着这个标准设计预制了一批门窗，但是，设计师们对这套标准设计没有注意，给建筑单位设计的门窗的样式仍是奇奇怪怪的花样，已做好的门窗就销不出去，有一千二百樘门窗在工厂仓库里睡了三年大觉，最近才找到主顾，像清理呆滞物资一样推出去了！
    光华木材厂这样的生产情况是不正常的，厂里的同志为这件事感到很苦恼。当然，厂的本身是存在许多缺点的，如计划管理还不够好，经验不足等。但是，这种苦恼主要是由于设计人员标新立异、盲目追求形式所造成的。现在的门窗已有部分标准设计了，可是各土木建筑单位对如何依靠近代化的工厂来进行加工，仍不明确，并极力组织筹备工地加工厂，使光华木材厂没工可做，反之，预料工程紧张阶段到来后，光华木材厂又将无法应付。因此，设计人员应该端正设计思想，从节约观点出发，在建筑中推广各种标准设计，制出标准门窗设计图样，土木建筑单位要避免分散生产，使光华木材厂生产能正规起来，做到生产计划化、工厂化。
