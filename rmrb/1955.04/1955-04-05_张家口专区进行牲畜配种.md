Zhangjiakou Prefecture Carries Out Livestock Breeding

    Farmers in Zhangjiakou Prefecture, Hebei Province, are actively carrying out livestock breeding work. In early February, all counties in the prefecture held animal husbandry meetings to further implement the policy of "vigorous breeding, focusing on improvement," and specifically determined this year's livestock development plans and measures. By mid-February, more than 600 breeding animals (horses and donkeys) throughout the prefecture had generally begun breeding. Zhang Baoshan Cooperative Breeding Station in Yu County and its six sub-stations used thirty-nine male animals, adhering to the principles of "contracting breeding and guaranteeing pregnancy by area" and "roaming the countryside," and penetrated deeply into rural areas. By the end of February, they had bred more than 100 female animals. The four breeding animals at the Li Qi Breeding Station in Shacheng Town, Huailai County, also carried out breeding at market fairs in the towns. In order not to delay farmers' spring plowing production, many livestock breeders also pulled the male breeding animals to various villages for breeding. (Zhao Xinmin)

    张家口专区进行牲畜配种
    河北省张家口专区农民积极开展牲畜配种工作。二月初，全专区各县普遍召开了畜牧会议，进一步贯彻了“大力繁殖，重点改良”的方针，并具体确定了今年发展牲畜的计划和措施。二月中旬，全专区六百多头种畜（马、驴）就普遍开始了配种。蔚县张宝山合作配种站和六个分站三十九头公畜按照“分片包配包怀”和“巡回下乡”的原则深入农村，到二月底，就配种一百多头母畜。怀来县沙城镇李祺配种站四头种畜也按集镇上市配种。不少养种畜户为了不误农民春耕生产，还拉着公种到各乡去配种。　（赵新民）
