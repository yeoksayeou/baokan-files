    Lanxin Railway Improves Labor Protection Conditions for Workers
    The labor protection conditions for the railway construction workers on the Lanxin Railway are improving daily. Several worker bathhouses are being built on the Gobi Desert and grassland construction sites. Thousands of square meters of housing for workers' families have also been established along the construction line. Recently, four hundred white canvas tents capable of blocking wind, sand, and intense sunlight will be transported to the Gobi Desert and grassland construction sites, allowing railway construction workers to rest nearby during their breaks. The Lanxin Railway construction leading agency has also ordered thousands of water bottles from Shanghai and other places to solve the drinking water problem for railway construction workers; at the same time, a large amount of funding has been allocated to improve the labor protection conditions for mountain workers. Currently, designers are designing a special water tank, which will be connected to the rock drill with a leather tube, so that the rock powder can combine with water during drilling and no longer scatter. In addition, it is also planned to install a "muffler" on the rock drill to reduce the noise when the machine is running.
    In the labor competition, the workers building the Lanxin Railway have saved the country a lot of project costs. The increased production and savings from the construction of the Lanzhou to Wushaoling section alone is worth several million yuan. Most of the funds for improving the labor protection conditions for workers this year are allocated from the enterprise bonus fund.

    兰新路改善职工劳动保护条件
    兰新铁路筑路职工的劳动保护条件在日益改善。在戈壁滩、草滩工地上，正在建筑着几座职工浴室。几千平方公尺的职工家属住房也已经在沿线工地上建立起来。最近还要把四百顶能够挡住风砂和烈日的白帆布棚运到戈壁滩、草滩工地上，使筑路职工工余时可以就近休息。兰新铁路施工领导机关还向上海等地订购了数千个水壶，以解决筑路职工的饮水问题；同时拨出了很大的一笔经费来改善开山工人的劳动保护条件。目前设计人员正在设计一种特殊的水箱，把这种水箱用皮管接在凿岩机上，凿岩时岩粉就能够和水结在一起，不再飞散开来。此外，还准备在凿岩机上安装一种“消音器”，可以减少机器开动时的噪音。
    修筑兰新铁路的职工在劳动竞赛中为国家节约了许多工程费用，光修筑兰州到乌鞘岭一段所增产节约的价值就有几百万元。今年改善职工劳动保护条件的绝大部分费用是从企业奖励基金中拨出的。
