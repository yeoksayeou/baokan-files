Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 6th: As spring ploughing and sowing are about to fully unfold on the Kang Tibetan Plateau, over forty work groups composed of personnel stationed in Tibet and the Qamdo region, along with local officials and chieftains, went to rural areas and pastures in various locations before the end of March to distribute interest-free agricultural and pastoral loans, as well as iron farm tools free of charge.

　　In 1955, the State Council allocated a total of 700,000 yuan (RMB) in interest-free agricultural and pastoral loans to the Tibet region and the Qamdo region.  The allocation for free iron farm tools in the Qamdo region, along with spring ploughing production funds for disaster-stricken farmers in Gyantse and Shigatse in 1954, totaled 250,000 yuan (RMB).

　　The six agricultural loan groups in the Lhasa region have already departed and will distribute agricultural loans to farmers in more than twenty Dzongs and Xikas in the Lhasa River valley.  More than ten work groups in the Shigatse and Gyantse regions are distributing loan grain to farmers along the middle reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River and the banks of the Nyang Chu River.  The more than one million jin of Qing稞 (highland barley) allocated by the Tibetan local government to disaster victims is also being distributed to farmers by work groups of the Gyantse and Shigatse disaster relief committees. Work groups have also been dispatched to pastoral areas in northern Tibet and the Ali region from Shigatse, Nagqu and Ngari to issue pastoral loans. In early March, Qamdo, Dengqen, Bomi and other places sent work groups to distribute approximately 100,000 pieces of iron farm tools purchased with funds allocated by the State Council last year to farmers free of charge. Farmers in the Bomi region, who previously lacked iron farm tools in particular, will receive over 13,000 pieces of iron farm tools such as hoes and rakes this year, with some more agriculturally developed Dzongs receiving an average of more than three pieces per household.

　　Medical and propaganda workers also participated in the agricultural loan work groups, providing medical treatment, vaccinations, and slideshow screenings to farmers, and promoting opposition to the use of atomic weapons and the State Council's various decisions and replies regarding Tibet.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 6th: While the high mountains of the Bomi region are still covered with white snow, the peach blossoms in the valley plains are in full bloom. Farmers are busy with spring ploughing and sowing. On the shores of Lake Yigong, where two crops are harvested annually, the winter wheat and highland barley fields are a lush green. The planting area in the Bomi region in 1955 has expanded compared to 1954. Quzong and Qingduo Dzong have opened up more than 300 mu of uncultivated land.

　　Before spring ploughing and sowing, Tibetan farmers in the Bomi region received over 90,000 jin of interest-free loan seeds of highland barley. More than 13,000 pieces of iron farm tools have also been transported to various Dzongs and are being distributed to farmers.

    西藏和昌都地区发放无息农牧业贷粮贷款
    波密河谷平原的农民已经开始春耕播种
    新华社拉萨六日电　康藏高原即将全面展开春耕播种，西藏地区和昌都地区由进藏工作人员和当地官员、头人组成的四十多个工作组，在三月底以前分别到各地农村、牧场发放无息农牧业贷粮、贷款和无偿铁质农具。
    一九五五年国务院拨给西藏地区和昌都地区的无息农贷、牧贷共合人民币七十万元。拨给昌都地区的无偿铁质农具费和江孜、日喀则一九五四年受灾农民的春耕生产款项共合人民币二十五万元。
    拉萨地区的六个农贷组已出发，他们将向拉萨河流域二十多个宗和溪卡的农民发放农贷粮。日喀则、江孜地区十多个工作组正向雅鲁藏布江中游和年楚河两岸的农民发放贷粮。西藏地方政府拨给灾民的一百多万斤青稞，也正由江孜、日喀则救灾委员会的工作组向农民发放。日喀则、黑河和阿里等地还派出了工作组到藏北和阿里牧业区发放牧业贷款。昌都、丁青、波密等地在三月初就派出了工作组，把去年国务院拨款购置的约十万件铁质农具，无偿发给农民。过去特别缺少铁质农具的波密地区的农民，今年可以得到一万三千多件锄、耙等铁质农具，部分农业较发达的宗，平均每户得到三件以上。
    医务、宣传工作者也参加了农贷工作组，给农民治病、种痘和放映幻灯，并向农民宣传反对使用原子武器和国务院关于西藏地方的各项决定和批复。
    据新华社拉萨六日电　波密地区的高山上还积着白雪，河谷平原的桃花已经怒放了。农民们正忙着春耕播种。年收两季作物的易贡湖畔，冬小麦和青稞田一片葱绿。一九五五年波密地区的播种面积比一九五四年扩大了。曲宗和倾多宗开了三百多亩生荒。
    在春耕播种以前，波密地区的藏族农民得到了九万多斤青稞的无息贷种。一万三千多件铁质农具也已运到各宗，正向农民发放。
