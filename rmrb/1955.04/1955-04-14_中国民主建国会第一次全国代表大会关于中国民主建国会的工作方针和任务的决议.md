    The First National Congress of the China Democratic National Construction Association listened to and discussed Comrade Huang Yanpei's opening speech and expressed complete agreement.

    The Congress unanimously believes that as a democratic party within the Chinese People's Democratic United Front, this Association must, together with the people of the whole country, take the general task of the state during the transition period as its own general task. That is to say, it must take the general task of the state during the transition period as the general goal of struggle for all levels of organizations and all members of the Association. In this general task, the Association also bears a special mission to assist the state in gradually completing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce: under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and in accordance with the requirements of the state's general task during the transition period, unite and educate the national bourgeoisie to actively accept socialist transformation. To this end, the Association must cultivate and improve the performance of its industrial and commercial members in abiding by the law, improving production and management, and accepting socialist transformation, making them role models and backbone members of the industrial and commercial sector; closely connect with the masses in the industrial and commercial sector, assist the government in publicizing and implementing the state's policies, laws, and decrees, especially the state's policies on the utilization, restriction, and transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and understand, study, and reflect their opinions and demands, represent their legitimate interests, and oppose all illegal acts that endanger the public interest, disrupt social and economic order, and undermine the state's economic plan.

    In order to guarantee the implementation of the above principles and tasks, the Congress fully agrees with the four aspects pointed out in the opening speech that the Association should pay full attention to in its future work, and the five requirements that members, especially industrial and commercial members, should clearly understand and earnestly implement.

    The Congress unanimously resolved to call on all members of the Association to: strengthen unity, work hard, and, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, strive to further assist the state in carrying out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, persist in the struggle against enemies at home and abroad, and build a socialist society.
