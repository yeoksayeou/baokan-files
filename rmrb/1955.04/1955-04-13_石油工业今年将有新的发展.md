With the rapid growth of natural crude oil and synthetic crude oil production, China's crude oil processing industry will further develop this year. The output of synthetic crude oil, gasoline, kerosene, diesel, lubricating oil and other products this year will increase by 30% to more than 70% compared to 1954, and the number of new products will be 2.4 times that of successful trial production in 1954.

In order to complete this year's production tasks, the Petroleum Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry convened a national refinery director conference from March 29 to April 8, and determined that each factory should implement six important measures. In the concluding remarks of the meeting, Kang Shi'en, Director of the Petroleum Administration Bureau, severely criticized the abnormal operation and unreasonable use of equipment in individual units, the emphasis on objective difficulties when production tasks were not completed, and the behavior of falsely reporting output and deceiving superiors. In addition, he praised some units that took the initiative to propose increased production plans and stated that the Bureau would definitely provide strong support for these plans.

    石油工业今年将有新的发展
    随着天然原油和人造原油生产的迅速增长，今年我国原油加工工业将有进一步的发展；今年人造原油、汽油、煤油、柴油、润滑油等产品产量，将比一九五四年增长百分之三十到百分之七十以上，新产品将为一九五四年试制成功的二点四倍。
    燃料工业部石油管理总局为完成今年的生产任务，从三月二十九日至四月八日召开了全国炼油厂厂长会议，确定各厂要执行六项重要措施。石油管理总局康世恩局长在会议总结中，对个别单位操作不正常、设备使用不合理，生产任务完不成就强调客观困难，以及谎报产量，欺骗上级的行为给予严厉的批评；另对于主动提出增产计划的某些单位则予以表扬，并表示总局对这些计划一定给予有力的支持。
