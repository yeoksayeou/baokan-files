Gansu Provincial Horticultural Experiment Station, in order to promote superior fruit tree varieties, recently transported a large number of fruit tree saplings to Jiuquan, Wuwei, and Dunhuang in Longxi, Linxia in Gannan, and Lintao and other arid areas.

　　The fruit tree saplings transported this time are mainly apples, pears, and peaches. Most of the varieties are special products of Lanzhou, and some are varieties transplanted from other provinces and tested by the Horticultural Experiment Station. These varieties have many advantages. For example, the "Golden Delicious" apple has strong insect resistance and high and stable yield; the "Green Banana" apple tastes delicious and is easy to store; other varieties such as honey peaches, winter fragrant pears, and winter fruit pears are all famous for their juicy and fleshy fruit.

　　In order to supply more saplings to various regions in the autumn of this year and the spring of next year, the Horticultural Experiment Station is now working hard on seed selection and grafting. (Our correspondent in Lanzhou)

    甘肃省推广优良果树品种
    甘肃省园艺试验总场为了推广优良果树品种，最近向陇西的酒泉、武威、敦煌，甘南的临夏以及干旱地区的临洮等地，运去大批果树苗。
      这次运的果树苗主要是苹果、梨和桃。其中大部分品种是兰州的特产，有一部分是由外省移植并经园艺总场试种过的品种。这些品种都有不少优点。如“黄元帅”苹果，抗虫能力强，产量高而且稳定；“青香蕉”苹果味美可口，而且容易储藏；其他如水蜜桃、冬香梨、冬果梨等都以汁多肉肥而著名。
    园艺试验总场为了在今年秋天和明年春天供给各地更多的树苗，现在正在紧张地进行选种和高接工作。（本报驻兰州记者）
