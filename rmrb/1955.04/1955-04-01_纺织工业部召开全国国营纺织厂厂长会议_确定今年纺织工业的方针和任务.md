Xinhua News Agency, March 30th. The Ministry of Textile Industry convened a National Conference of Directors of State-Owned Textile Factories from March 11th to 23rd, and determined the guidelines and tasks for the textile industry in 1955. During the conference, Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi attended and gave important instructions.

The meeting considered that state-owned textile enterprises had done a great deal of work in meeting the needs of the people's livelihood in 1954. According to statistics, the total output value plan of state-owned and central public-private joint textile enterprises was 103.25% completed in 1954; labor productivity completed 104.59% of the plan; financial profit completed 124.1% of the plan; and product costs were also lower than planned. Major products such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, printed and dyed cloth, worsted wool fabrics, woolen fabrics,麻袋 (ma dai - sacks), linen and linen canvas, silk fabrics, and knitted shirts and trousers all over-fulfilled their plans. Among these products, except for a few products whose output was slightly lower than in 1953 due to raw material supply difficulties, the rest all increased to varying degrees compared with 1953.

The meeting believed that the management level of textile enterprises had also improved considerably due to the implementation of work plans, strengthening of technical leadership, and preliminary establishment of the director responsibility system in 1954. The meeting considered that the current shortcomings of textile enterprises were mainly that the completion of the plan was not comprehensive enough, the quality plan was generally poorly completed, and there was still serious waste in production and capital construction. The representatives attending the meeting focused on examining the lack of an overall concept and a lack of careful calculation in the current management by exposing the waste phenomena in the enterprises; the meeting also conducted serious criticism of the complacency existing in some cadres.

The representatives attending the meeting conducted discussions based on the current problems existing in state-owned textile enterprises and the supply of raw materials in the textile industry, and believed that the development speed of the textile industry must be adapted to the growth rate of agricultural production. According to the raw material supply situation, the meeting made specific arrangements for production in 1955 in accordance with the principle of "overall planning and unified arrangement." The meeting required all bureaus and factories to further strengthen planning in production; comprehensively practice economy, strictly check waste in the production process; and cotton, wool, linen, silk and other textile enterprises and printing and dyeing, textile machinery manufacturing and other enterprises should pay special attention to saving raw materials on the premise of ensuring quality. Regarding improving product quality, the meeting pointed out that quality standards must be earnestly implemented, experimental work should be strengthened, and technical supervision should be strictly carried out. In capital construction work, attention should be paid to overcoming the backlog of state funds and extravagance and waste in building equipment. Whether it is an agency or an enterprise, attention should be paid to streamlining organizations, reducing non-production personnel, and overcoming the phenomenon of bloated organizations and overstaffing. The meeting also conducted specific research on how enterprises should strengthen financial cost management, gradually implement economic accounting systems, and how to establish and improve various responsibility systems.

    纺织工业部召开全国国营纺织厂厂长会议
    确定今年纺织工业的方针和任务
    新华社三十日讯　纺织工业部在三月十一日到二十三日召开全国国营纺织厂厂长会议，确定了一九五五年纺织工业的方针任务。会议期间，国务院副总理陈毅曾到会作了重要指示。
    会议认为：国营纺织企业一九五四年在供应人民生活需要方面做了很多工作。根据统计，国营及中央公私合营纺织企业一九五四年总产值计划完成百分之一百零三点二五；劳动生产率完成计划百分之一百零四点五九；财务利润计划完成百分之一百二十四点一；产品成本也比计划降低。主要产品如棉纱、棉布、印染布、精纺毛织品、粗纺毛织品、麻袋、亚麻布及亚麻帆布、丝织品、针织衫裤等产品，全都超额完成了计划。这些产品中，除个别产品因原料供应困难略比一九五三年减产外，其余都比一九五三年有不同程度的增长。
    会议认为：各纺织企业由于在一九五四年推行了作业计划，加强了技术领导和初步建立了厂长负责制，企业的管理水平也有不少提高。会议认为纺织企业目前存在的缺点，主要是完成计划不够全面，质量计划一般完成较差，在生产和基本建设方面都还存在着严重的浪费现象。到会代表通过揭发企业中的浪费现象，着重检查了目前经营管理中缺乏全面整体观念和不精打细算的思想；会议对于某些干部中存在的骄傲自满思想，也进行了严肃的批判。
    到会代表根据当前国营纺织企业存在的问题及纺织工业原料的供应情况，进行了讨论，认为纺织工业的发展速度，必须与农业生产增长的速度相适应。会议根据原料供应情况，按照“统筹兼顾、统一安排”的方针，对一九五五年的生产作了具体安排。会议要求各局、厂进一步加强生产中的计划性；全面地厉行节约，严格检查生产过程中的浪费现象；在保证质量的条件下，棉、毛、麻、丝等纺织企业和印染、纺织机械制造等企业，都应该特别注意节约原材料。关于提高产品质量方面，会议指出必须认真执行质量标准，加强试验工作及严格进行技术监督工作。在基本建设工作中，应注意克服积压国家资金及在建筑设备上的铺张浪费现象。不论机关或企业都应注意精简机构减少非生产人员，克服机构臃肿、人浮于事的现象。会议对于各企业如何加强财务成本管理，逐步贯彻经济核算制和如何建立与健全各种责任制度等方面，也作了具体研究。
