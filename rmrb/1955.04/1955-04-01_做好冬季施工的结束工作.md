    Do a Good Job of Concluding Winter Construction
    Cheng Li
    The weather in the North has gradually warmed up, and winter construction for capital construction is about to end, and normal construction is about to begin. This is a very tense moment. However, some comrades in winter construction units are showing a slack mood, saying, "Winter is over, we can breathe a sigh of relief!" This is wrong.
    Why is it wrong? We know that the winter construction projects in various regions last winter and this spring were relatively broad, and the construction methods were also more complex. Especially for bricklaying projects, most of them used the freezing method, and some units also carried out indoor and outdoor plastering and roofing with roofing felt. Concrete projects mostly used the heat storage method, and some adopted chemical admixtures and electric heating methods. Because some workers have not yet mastered the operating techniques of winter construction well, and some have not fully complied with the operating procedures during operation, some brick masonry joints are too large and uneven in thickness; the water-cement ratio, temperature, and tamping of concrete still have some problems. Therefore, ending winter construction requires timely observation of settlement and maintenance measures during the thawing period to avoid quality accidents after thawing. And we should carefully study and learn lessons from the observation and maintenance work to accumulate experience for winter construction this year.
    In the past, some construction units did not pay enough attention to "conservation." The site was not well cleaned up, and various tools and materials were not well utilized and kept in good condition. For example, stoves, chimneys, incubators, insulation barrels, and various insulation materials were thrown everywhere and no one cared about them, allowing them to be damaged by sun and rain; used insulation materials were thrown into ditches, causing great losses to the people's property. The volume of winter construction last winter and this spring was large and widespread, and the number of various machines, tools, supplies, and insulation materials has greatly increased compared to the past. If we are not careful, it will cause great waste and loss. Therefore, the machines, tools, supplies, and various insulation materials used for winter construction should be sorted out, and utilized or properly stored according to different situations to avoid loss and waste.

    做好冬季施工的结束工作
    程里
    北方的天气已逐渐转暖，基本建设的冬季施工即将结束，正常的施工就要开始。这是一个十分紧张的时刻。可是，有的冬季施工单位的同志，却表现出一种松懈的情绪，说：“冬天已过，可以松一口气了！”这是不对的。
    为什么不对呢？我们知道，去冬今春各地区的冬季施工工程项目比较广，施工方法也比较复杂。尤其是砌砖工程，大部分是采用冻结法，有的单位还进行了室内、外抹灰和卷材屋面的施工。混凝土工程则大部采用了蓄热法，部分采取了掺化学剂及电热法等。由于有的职工对冬季施工的操作技术还不能很好掌握，有的则在操作当中没有完全遵守操作规程，所以有的砖砌体灰缝过大，厚薄不均；混凝土的水灰比和温度及捣固还有些问题。因此，结束冬季施工，就需要及时作好开冻期间的沉陷观测和养生等措施，以免开冻后发生质量事故。并应从观测和养生工作中，细致的研究和吸取教训，为今年冬季施工积累经验。
    过去，有的施工单位对“节约”重视不够，现场没很好的清理，对各种用具和材料不很好地利用和保管，如火炉、烟囱、保温箱、保温桶以及各种保温材料等遍地乱扔，无人过问，任其日晒雨淋随便蹧蹋；将用过的保温材料扔到沟里，给人民财产造成很大的损失。去冬今春冬季施工量大而面广，各种机具、用品及保温材料较过去大增。要是稍不注意，就会造成很大的浪费和损失。因此，对于冬季施工所使用的机具、用品和各种保温材料，应进行整理，并分别情况加以利用或妥善保存，以免损失浪费。
