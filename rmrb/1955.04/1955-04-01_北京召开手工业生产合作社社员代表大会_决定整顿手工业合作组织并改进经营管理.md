    This newspaper reports that the Beijing Municipal Federation of Handicraft Production Cooperatives convened the first second member representative assembly of Beijing from March 28 to 31. A total of 738 representatives from 314 grass-roots cooperatives (including shirt, clock, candy, sewing, carpet, woodware, ironware, metal processing, and other 19 industries) attended the meeting. Deng Jie, Deputy Director of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Production Cooperatives, made a report at the meeting.

    The meeting summarized the work of 1954. According to preliminary statistics, a total of 191 new cooperatives and groups were developed in 1954, with an increase of 11,046 members. Together with those organized previously, there were more than 24,700 people, accounting for 26 percent of the city's current individual handicraft practitioners. The proportion of the total annual output value in the city's individual handicraft output value also increased from 23.2 percent in 1953 to 37 percent. The annual output of some products, such as shirts and candies, accounted for more than 20 percent of the city's total annual output of these industries. The newly built cooperatives and groups in 1954 included 74 types, opening up cooperative positions in more industries. Among them, the number of people developed in the three major industries of metal product processing, wood processing, and bamboo, rattan, willow and grass accounted for 36 percent of the total number of people developed. This combination of focus and diversification is particularly adapted to the needs of urban and rural people for daily necessities and the needs of the capital's industrial construction.

    However, the meeting believed that there are still some problems in the handicraft production cooperatives, mainly that the ideological awareness of the members and cadres of most cooperatives is not high, and there is a general capitalist management ideology. The phenomenon of poor product quality is serious. Production management is also very chaotic. The financial management system is unsound, and the phenomenon of corruption and waste is also very serious.

    According to the spirit of the Fourth National Handicraft Conference and the instructions of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on handicraft work, the meeting determined that the basic task for 1955 is: under the policy of "active leadership and steady progress," and in accordance with the spirit of "reasonable arrangements and overall consideration," the focus of work is to further rectify the existing handicraft cooperative organizations. Starting with improving product quality and reducing product costs, opposing capitalist management ideas, effectively managing the existing cooperative organizations, accumulating and summarizing experience in running cooperatives, training cadres to run cooperatives, and laying the foundation for further socialist transformation of handicrafts; on this basis, steadily carry out development work, and cooperate with the rational arrangement of handicraft production to overcome the difficulties in production and sales of handicrafts.

    Twenty representatives spoke successively at the meeting. Everyone unanimously expressed that they would implement the spirit of the meeting, oppose capitalist management ideas, establish the concept of serving the masses, ensure that no defective products are produced, and further improve the cooperative on the existing basis.

    北京召开手工业生产合作社社员代表大会
    决定整顿手工业合作组织并改进经营管理
    本报讯　北京市手工业生产合作社联合总社从三月二十八日到三十一日召开了北京市第一届第二次社员代表大会。出席大会的有三百一十四个基层社（包括衬衣、钟表、糖果、缝纫、地毯、木器、铁业、金属加工等十九个行业）的代表共七百三十八名。全国手工业生产合作总社副主任邓洁到会做了报告。
    会议总结了一九五四年的工作。据初步统计，一九五四年共发展社、组一百九十一个，增加社员一万一千零四十六人，连以前组织起来的共有二万四千七百多人，相当于全市现有个体手工业从业人员的百分之二十六。全年产值在全市个体手工业产值中所占的比重，也由一九五三年的百分之二十三点二，增至百分之三十七。有些产品如衬衣、糖果等年产量占全市各该工业年产总量的百分之二十以上。一九五四年新建的社、组包括七十四个类型，在较多的行业中开辟了合作化阵地；其中金属品加工、木材加工、竹藤柳草三个主要行业的发展人数占总发展人数百分之三十六。这种重点和多种多样相结合的发展工作，特别适应了城乡人民对生活日用品的需要和首都工业建设的需要。
    但是，会议认为，手工业生产合作社中还有一些问题，主要是大部分社的社员和干部的思想觉悟还不高，普遍有资本主义的经营思想，产品质量低劣现象严重，在生产管理上也很混乱，财务管理制度不健全，贪污浪费现象也很严重。
    会议根据第四次全国手工业会议的精神和中共北京市委关于手工业工作的指示，确定一九五五年的基本任务是：在“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针下，按照“合理安排，统筹兼顾”的精神，以进一步整顿现有手工业合作组织为工作重点，从提高产品质量，降低产品成本入手，反对资本主义经营思想，切实办好现有的合作组织，积累总结办社经验，培养办社干部，给进一步对手工业进行社会主义改造打下基础；在此基础上，稳步地进行发展工作，并配合对手工业生产的合理安排，克服手工业生产上的产销困难。
    会上有二十位代表相继发言，大家一致表示要贯彻大会精神，反对资本主义经营思想，树立为群众服务的观点，保证不出废次品，使合作社在现有基础上再提高一步。
