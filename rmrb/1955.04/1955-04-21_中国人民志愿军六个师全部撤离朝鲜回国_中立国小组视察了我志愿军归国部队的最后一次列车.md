A spokesman for the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army announced: From March 31st to April 20th, all six divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have completely withdrawn from Korea and returned to the motherland. To date, including the seven divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army that withdrew from Korea from September 16th to October 3rd, 1954, a total of thirteen divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have successively withdrawn from Korea and returned to the motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 20th. The six divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning home have all withdrawn back to the motherland via the Sinuiju rear port by April 20th.

On the morning of the 20th, people from all walks of life in Sinuiju warmly saw off the last batch of troops of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning home. More than 9,000 Korean people came to Sinuiju Station to see them off.

When the last train carrying the Volunteer Army returning home entered the station, the station resounded with the enduring cheers of "Long live the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army." Representatives of the Volunteer Army returning home were surrounded by thousands of well-wishers to the rostrum, and many Korean female students, children, and housewives ran to the stage to present them with flowers and gifts. Students from Sinuiju Girls' High School presented two exquisitely framed portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and Marshal Kim Il-sung to the representatives of the Volunteer Army returning home.

After holding a farewell meeting, the Korean people and the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army returning home sang and danced jubilantly on the platform for more than two hours.

As the train slowly left the station, the Korean people who came to see them off followed the train to the Yalu River Bridge, waving handkerchiefs and towels with reluctance.

From March 31st to April 20th, in the past 21 days, more than 155,000 Korean people rushed to Sinuiju Station to see off the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning home, and they presented a total of more than 4,200 souvenirs to the Volunteer Army returning home, and more than 9,000 letters and telegrams of condolences.

The people of Andong City held a welcome meeting at the station to warmly welcome the victorious Volunteer Army troops returning home.

During the return of the six divisions of the Volunteer Army, factories, schools, and various organizations and groups in Andong City sent representatives to the station every day to welcome them. Many units held joint celebrations with the Volunteer Army returning home during the welcome.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 20th. From 13:30 to 14:00 (Korean time) on the afternoon of the 20th, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission stationed in Sinuiju inspected the last train of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning home. They inspected each carriage, counted and verified all personnel, weapons, and ammunition.
