    Suggest Switching to Coal Instead of Firewood for Fuel
    To the Editor:
    Many regions are accustomed to using firewood and charcoal as fuel, and the annual consumption is staggering. In many places, even good timber is split into firewood, causing great damage to the country's forest resources.
    According to the former Southwest Forestry Bureau, the total timber demand in the Southwest region in 1953 was approximately 41.5 million cubic meters, while iron smelting, copper smelting, tin smelting, salt boiling, and urban and rural civilian fuel wood and charcoal accounted for approximately 39 million cubic meters. It is estimated that the Southwest region will use 200.7 million cubic meters of timber in five years, of which smelting, salt boiling, and urban and rural civilian fuel wood and charcoal will account for approximately 195.5 million cubic meters. This means that the vast majority of timber is used as fuel.
    A small iron factory in Lijiang County, Yunnan Province, produces 20,000 to 50,000 jin of iron annually, consuming 416,500 jin of oak firewood, 161,000 jin of oak charcoal, and 84,000 jin of pine firewood. Two copper factories require about 1 million jin of pine charcoal per year. In the third and fourth districts of Fuyuan County, there are 39 iron smelting furnaces, which consume approximately 3,900 trees with a diameter of 5 inches every day.
    There are 66 iron smelting furnaces in Xinyang Special District, Henan Province. Each furnace requires 6,000 jin of charcoal per day. Assuming 200 workdays per year for each furnace, the 66 iron furnaces require a total of 79.92 million jin of charcoal per year.
    The local state-owned porcelain factory in Pingxiang, Jiangxi Province, purchases 30,000 jin of pine firewood every day. There are more than 200 porcelain factories in Jingdezhen, requiring a total of 2 million dan of pine firewood each year. Nearby people cut down a large amount of timber suitable for sleepers and pit props as firewood and sell it to the porcelain factories.
    When the Lilin Porcelain Factory Company in Hunan Province entrusted the Chen County Forestry Bureau to purchase firewood, they only wanted pine wood and not miscellaneous wood, requiring 20 million jin of pine firewood in the fourth quarter of 1954 alone. The Shengyang iron ore mine burns 40,000 jin of firewood every day.
    In Rong County, Guangxi Province, townships in the ninth district always cut down large trees for firewood to burn lime, bricks, and tiles, resulting in great waste. The Dashankou lime kiln alone requires 32,500 jin of dry firewood for each firing. It fires at least 25 kilns a year, requiring a total of 812,500 jin of firewood. The majority of this firewood is good timber that could be used for pit props and wood panels.
    In order to protect the country's forest resources, conserve timber, and support national industrial construction, we suggest that Party and government leaders at all levels actively educate the masses to plant more trees, protect forests, and conserve timber. At the same time, in areas where coal is available, vigorously encourage users to gradually replace firewood and charcoal with coal. We believe this is a very important task for saving a large amount of timber. Due to years of habit, many places always think that burning firewood is easier, but in fact, burning coal is much more economical. According to the experience of Pingliang County, Gansu Province, coal can completely replace firewood as fuel. There are 95 brick and tile kilns in Pingliang County and Pingliang City, which burn 28,068,800 jin of firewood a year. There are 91 oil mills, which require 2,866,500 jin of firewood a year. Due to the large consumption of timber, the remaining state-owned forests in the Anguo, Kongtong, Wuan, and Qingfu districts of Pingliang County have been severely damaged. For example, the Shiwangou in the front gorge of Kongtong has been cut into a strip 2 li wide and 30 li long; the back gorge has been cut into a strip 4 li wide and 30 li long. In the Anguo district, the area near the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway is completely bare, and even small trees as thick as fingers have been cut down or dug up by the roots. This serious situation has aroused the attention of the local Party and government leaders. In 1953, a meeting was held to formulate the "Plan for Converting Brick, Tile, and Oil Industries to Coal Burning." Through the examples of using coal to burn bricks and tiles in Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Huating, propaganda and education were carried out among kiln owners and workers. The trial burning results showed that it took only six and a half days to burn a kiln, which was two days less than using firewood, reduced costs, and produced beautiful bricks and tiles. Soon, the vast majority of kiln owners switched to coal burning.
    The successful experience of Pingliang County and Pingliang City in advocating the use of coal instead of firewood as fuel was circulated to the whole country by the Ministry of Forestry in February 1954. As early as August 1951, the Government Administration Council's "Directive on Saving Timber" also clearly pointed out that "in areas where timber and charcoal are habitually used as fuel, ... the gradual replacement of coal fuel should be promoted, and the sale of good timber as fuel should be prohibited." Unfortunately, some places have not paid enough attention to this central directive. As a result, the waste of timber caused by fuel wood consumption still exists seriously, which is very inappropriate. We hope that all regions can pay attention to this issue. Educate everyone to cherish the forests of the motherland and change the habit of burning firewood.

### 建议改用煤炭代替木柴作燃料

    建议改用煤炭代替木柴作燃料编辑同志：
    许多地区习惯用木柴、木炭作燃料，每年消耗的数量极为惊人。不少地方甚至将很好的成材劈成薪柴，使国家森林资源受到很大破坏。
    据前西南林业局估计，一九五三年全西南区木材需要量约为四千一百五十多万立方公尺，而冶铁、炼铜、炼锡、熬盐和城乡民用薪炭柴，约占三千九百多万立方公尺。五年内全西南区估计用木材二亿零七百多万立方公尺，其中冶炼、熬盐及城乡民用薪炭柴，约达一亿九千五百多万立方公尺。这就是说绝大部分木材都当作燃料用了。
    云南丽江县有个小铁厂，每年出铁两万到五万斤，要消耗栎柴四十一万六千五百斤，栎炭十六万一千斤，松柴八万四千斤；两个铜厂全年共需松炭一百万斤左右。富源县三、四两区有炼铁炉三十九座，每天要消耗直径五市寸的树木约三千九百株。
    河南省信阳专区有六十六个炼铁炉，每炉每天需木炭六千斤，每炉每年以二百个劳动日计，六十六个铁炉一年共需七千九百二十万斤木炭。
    江西省萍乡地方国营瓷厂，每天要收购松柴三万斤。景德镇有瓷厂二百多家，每年共需松柴二百万担，附近群众把能做枕木、坑木的大量成材都当做烧柴砍了，卖给瓷厂。
    湖南醴陵瓷厂公司委托郴县森工局收购烧柴时，只要松木，不要杂木，光在一九五四年第四季度就需松柴两千万斤。邵阳的生铁矿每天要烧木柴四万斤。
    广西容县九区各乡烧石灰、砖瓦，总是砍大树作劈柴，浪费很大，单是大山口一个石灰窑，每烧一窑就要干柴三万二千五百斤。每年至少烧二十五窑，共要烧柴八十一万二千五百斤。这些柴的绝大部分是可作坑木、木板的好木材。
    为了保护国家森林资源，节约木材，支援国家工业建设，我们建议各地党政领导上，要积极教育群众多种树木，保护森林，节约木材；同时在某些能够取得煤炭的地区，大力劝导用户逐步以煤代替木柴、木炭。我们认为这是大量节省木材的一件很重要的工作。许多地方由于多年的习惯，总认为烧柴省事，其实烧煤比烧柴还省得多。根据甘肃省平凉县的经验，煤炭完全可以代替木柴来作燃料。甘肃省平凉县和平凉市共有砖瓦窑九十五个，一年要烧木柴二千八百零六万八千八百斤；油房九十一座，一年需木柴二百八十六万六千五百斤；由于大量木材的消耗，使平凉县安国、崆峒、武安、清福四个区残存的国有森林遭受到严重破坏。如崆峒前峡的十万沟被砍进了二里宽三十里长；后峡被砍进了四里宽三十里长；安国区靠近西兰公路的地区，已满山光秃，连残存如指粗的小树也被砍光或连根挖了。这一严重情况引起了当地党政领导上的重视，在一九五三年召开了会议，制订了“砖瓦油业改烧煤炭的计划”。通过西安、兰州、华亭用煤烧砖瓦的实例，对窑户、工人进行了宣传教育，试烧结果，六天半就烧好一窑，比用木柴少烧两天，降低了成本，烧出的砖瓦也很漂亮。不久，绝大部分窑户都改用煤烧窑了。
    平凉县和平凉市提倡用煤代替木柴作燃料的成功经验，中央林业部曾于一九五四年二月间通报全国。早在一九五一年八月政务院“关于节约木材的指示”中也明确指出“在习惯上使用木材、木炭当作燃料的地区，……应提倡逐步改用煤炭燃料，并禁止将良好的成材木料劈作燃料出售。”可惜有些地方对于中央这一指示还没有足够的重视。以致因薪炭消耗所造成的浪费木材的情况，仍然严重地存在着，这是很不应该的，我们希望各地能注意这个问题。教育大家爱护祖国森林，改变烧木柴的习惯。
