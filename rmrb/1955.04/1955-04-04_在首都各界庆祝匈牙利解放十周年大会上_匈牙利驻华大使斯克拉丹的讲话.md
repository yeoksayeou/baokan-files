Comrade Chairman, dear comrades, friends:
    On April 4, 1945, the glorious Soviet Red Army completely eliminated the remnants of the fascists on the entire territory of Hungary. Our motherland became a free and independent country for the first time in history, and from then on, the working people took control of the leadership of the country.
    In the course of historical development, our people have tried several times to achieve their freedom and independence. Dózsa, Rákóczi, Aser Damas, Kossuth, Petőfi, Táncsics, and others have all demonstrated with glorious deeds how much our people love the freedom of their motherland. Unfortunately, their efforts only achieved temporary success. The freedom we finally obtained was brought to us by the Soviet Union. Therefore, April 4, 1945, is the most glorious day in Hungarian history, and our people have designated it as a national holiday.
    Now the working people of our country are celebrating the tenth anniversary of liberation. The workers are dressed in festive attire, celebrating their liberation, and commemorating our great liberator, the Soviet Union, with gratitude. On this day, they will summarize their work and struggles, as well as the achievements they have made under the leadership of our great party, the Hungarian Working People's Party. They are preparing to meet new tasks; to ensure the peace and freedom necessary for the smooth progress of construction.
    Ten years is not a long time in history, but in these ten years, the working people of our country, with the help of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, have achieved tremendous achievements in socialist planned economy. In order to correctly understand this achievement, let me list some facts to illustrate the basis on which we started work and the conditions under which we governed the country.
    As a result of the fascist war of aggression, we inherited a dilapidated country. Due to the destruction of the war, 45 percent of the country's wealth was lost. Our industrial productivity was reduced to 30 to 35 percent. At the time of liberation, only 10 percent of the factories were able to operate normally. More than 20 percent of agricultural equipment was destroyed, more than half of the livestock, 38 percent of the mining and industry, 18 percent of the housing, 70 percent of the locomotives, and 80 percent of the railway vehicles were destroyed. Almost all bridges were blown up. 168,000 tons of working machine tools, textiles, leather, medicines, postal and railway equipment were looted and transported to Germany. More tragically, we sacrificed the lives of 400,000 people under fascist aggression. The country at that time was full of holes, but the working people of our country were not intimidated by the difficulties. With hope and confidence, they took over the leadership and rebuilt on the ruins. The reactionaries did not believe in or participate in this work. The Hungarian Communist Party planned to rebuild Hungary in three years, which they thought was impossible. In their view, rebuilding Hungary would require American aid, and even then, it would take at least 30 years. Today, everyone knows that the Hungarian workers have completed the national construction work that the Hungarian Communist Party originally planned to complete in three years in two years and five months, without any American aid, of course.
    After the successful completion of the Three-Year Plan, we began to implement the Five-Year Plan aimed at national industrialization. As a result, industrial output in 1953 exceeded three and a half times that of 1938. Hungary has developed from a predominantly agricultural country into an industrial country. The production of the most important basic materials in industry has exceeded the highest level of Hungary's pre-war industrial output several times; for example: electricity increased by 327.5 percent, steel by 233.4 percent, pig iron by 213.7 percent, and coal by 227.5 percent. Within the framework of the government's new program, the production of consumer goods has been greatly increased. Investment in consumer goods production has been continuously increasing.
    During the Five-Year Plan, 65 new factories were built, 60 of which were put into operation in the first four years. The most important new factories belonging to the heavy industry sector include: Stalinváros Ironworks, Inota Power Plant, Veszprém Dye Factory, Kiskunfélegyháza Railway Switch Factory, and Hadushazard Chemical Factory. Factories belonging to the light industry sector include: Szeged Textile Factory, Kiskunhalas Cotton Mill, Zalaegerszeg Garment Factory, Kecskemét Refrigerator Factory, and Szolnok Mechanized Bread Factory. Many items that were imported from abroad before the war have been manufactured by us during the Five-Year Plan. Great progress has also been made in electrification. The power generation of our power plants has gradually increased the use of electricity in our country. By the end of 1953, 70 percent of the rural areas in Hungary had been supplied with electricity.
    Considerable development has been made in public health facilities. During the Three-Year Plan, 171 hospitals were renovated, 29 were rebuilt, and 186 were equipped with supplementary equipment. In the past four years, the capacity of hospitals has increased by 13.5 percent, and the capacity of maternity hospitals has increased by 69.3 percent. Housing construction is also accelerating. In 1954, the state built 20,000 houses.
    Through land reform, 3,135,000 hectares of land have been distributed to farmers who lack land. Our farmers' cooperative movement is booming. In fact, 40 percent of Hungarian agriculture already belongs to the socialist component. Our state-owned machine stations now cultivate three times more land for farmers' cooperatives than in 1950, and more than five times more land for individual small farmers. There are now 375 agricultural machine stations in Hungary.
    Our party, the Hungarian Working People's Party, pays special attention to improving the cultural level of the people. Our country has become a country where everyone reads. In 1954, 2,750 kinds of books were published, totaling 20 million copies, of which fiction increased by 13 percent compared with 1953, and youth reading materials increased by 29 percent. The circulation of newspapers was one and a half times that of 1949.
    Since 1945, countless libraries have been opened every year. By 1954, 3,949 local public libraries had been opened. The organization of cultural groups has also developed greatly. In 1954, there were 1,883 cultural palaces and cultural centers, which is one and a half times that of 1950. At the same time, the increase in radio licenses also reflects the increase in cultural interest among urban and rural residents. In 1938, only 419,211 people received radio licenses. By 1953, the number of radio licenses reached 1,079,600, and in 1954 it reached 1,270,200.
    The progress of national education in Hungary can be illustrated by facts. In 1954, the number of students in the eight-year national school increased by more than 10 percent compared with 1938, and the number of people participating in the entrance examination also increased by 143 percent. The number of young people entering universities is also constantly increasing. Universities and specialized schools had a total of 47,454 students in the 1954-1955 academic year, while in 1938 there were only 11,747 students.
    The state's unprecedented assistance to every department of science, scholars, and scientists is unprecedented in the history of Hungarian culture. The achievements of Hungarian scientists in various fields prove that this extensive assistance has not failed.
    In the past ten years, there has been a huge improvement in the social welfare and public health facilities enjoyed by the people. In 1954, the number of beneficiaries under the social insurance system more than doubled compared with 1938. At the same time, public utilities have also developed equally in quantity and quality, such as offering discounts in resorts during holidays.
    Dear comrades, it is impossible to list all the achievements of the past ten years in this short speech. I have only selected some of the most important achievements to illustrate how much happiness liberation has made possible for us. By studying these facts, it can be clearly seen how great the happiness that liberation has brought to our working people is. Hungary has become a free and independent country. The working people have taken over the leadership of the country from the past ruling class and eliminated exploitation and poverty. Unemployment no longer exists in our country, and the constitution guarantees everyone's right to work. Land reform has met the most pressing demands of three million poor peasants. In the past, banks specialized in seizing farmers' property, houses, and every inch of their land. Now, farmers no longer have to fear them. Our intellectuals have become vigorous figures in the motherland. They have documents in their pockets that prove they will no longer go hungry and will no longer be unemployed.
    Thanks to the help of the Soviet Union, Hungary's achievements in foreign policy are inestimable. As early as August 17, 1945, the Soviet Union and Hungary signed the first Soviet-Hungarian trade agreement. On February 18, 1948, they signed the Soviet-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, which is of great significance and enhanced Hungary's prestige in the international arena. Since then, we have also signed treaties of the same nature with other countries, thereby making our cause of independence and defense of peace built on a solid and unshakable foundation. These treaties are built on the basis of equality, sincere mutual assistance, and defense of peace, and are completely different from the "alliances" concluded between imperialist countries and the aggressive blocs pieced together by American imperialists with aggressive intentions. These treaties have contributed to further consolidating the peace camp and preventing the escalating aggressive plans of American imperialism.
    The Hungarian people, who have deeply tasted the oppression and war disasters, deeply realize that they must vigilantly defend their national independence and strive to defend peace. The Hungarian government's foreign policy has been firmly and unanimously supported by the Hungarian people with sincerity and joy. This policy serves two goals: one is to defend peace, and the other is to ensure national independence. Hungary is willing to cooperate with the people of other countries in the world, because it believes that as long as the parties concerned can consistently respect each other's interests, this cooperation will produce satisfactory results. Therefore, the Hungarian People's Republic has taken the initiative to establish friendly relations between Hungary and other countries, and will certainly take the initiative in the future. Hungary has participated in the activities of various international organizations. The Hungarian government and various Hungarian groups have joined more than 140 international organizations. In 1954, Hungary sent representatives to 170 international conferences.
    Hungary's reasonable demand to join the United Nations organization has been rejected to this day due to the hostile attitude of the United States of America. Nevertheless, the Hungarian People's Republic continues to use every opportunity to promote the work of the United Nations in the spirit of the United Nations Charter. Therefore, Hungary gladly accepted the invitation to the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy and is willing to actively participate in the conference to achieve the control of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. The Hungarian people are watching with unease and indignation the imperialists' attempts to restore German aggression and rearm Germany. Due to past painful experiences, we know what the revival of German militarism will entail for us. For the sake of peace and collective security, at the meeting held in Moscow last November, Hungary and other peace-loving countries jointly issued a declaration, proposing suggestions on defending world peace.
    In terms of diplomacy, the establishment of trade and cultural relations between our country and the People's Republic of China is a major event. Although our two countries are far apart, it is exciting to cooperate in the family of free people for the common goals of building socialism and defending peace.
    The people of Hungary are delighted to see the great achievements of the great Chinese people in foreign policy and the growing development of foreign and trade relations of the People's Republic of China. This fact proves that despite the best efforts of American imperialism to obstruct the Chinese people's efforts for peace, the People's Republic of China, like our country, is willing to coexist peacefully with any country.
    We, the Hungarian people, I think, along with the people of the whole world, need peace, and even the American workers are condemning the aggressive policies of the American government. We are convinced that the growing strength of the people's love of justice will prevent these aggressive attempts. Anyone with a clear mind will realize that the US-Chiang treaty only benefits those who manufacture wars to extract huge profits. For the past ten years, the Hungarian people have been living a free and happy life, and they have understood the great significance of freedom.
    Therefore, we condemn the United States' policy of occupying Taiwan, and all actions aimed at oppressing other nations.
    Our people attach importance to the great achievements of the Chinese people in agriculture, industry and culture with concern.
    Compared with 1949, the People's Republic of China's electricity production in 1954 increased by 2.5 times, coal by 2.6 times, pig iron by 12.4 times, steel by 13.7 times, and cement by 7.2 times.
    These figures not only mean the strengthening of the power of the People's Republic of China, but also the strengthening of the power of the entire peace camp. We are proud to be friends of the great Chinese people. The Chinese people are carrying out a relentless struggle against the imperialists' aggressive policies; their love of freedom is becoming increasingly clear. Our cooperation, the strong strength of our peace camp, is the guarantee for defending our peace and independence.
    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Hungarian and Chinese people!
    Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!
    Long live the Soviet Union, the leader of the peace camp!
    Long live peace!

    在首都各界庆祝匈牙利解放十周年大会上
    匈牙利驻华大使斯克拉丹的讲话主席同志，亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    在一九四五年四月四日，光荣的苏联红军在整个匈牙利的国土上肃清了法西斯分子的残余，我们的祖国便成为一个自由独立的国家，这在历史上是第一次，从此劳动人民掌握了国家的领导权。
    在历史发展的过程中，我国人民曾经几次想取得他们的自由和独立。多尧、拉科齐、艾泽·达马士、科苏特、裴多菲、谭启琦等人都以光荣的事迹证明了我国人民是怎样热爱祖国的自由。不幸，他们的努力只得到了暂时的成功。我们最后所获得的自由是苏联带给我们的。因此，一九四五年四月四日是匈牙利历史上最光辉灿烂的一天，我国人民已经把它定为国庆纪念日。
    现在我国的劳动人民正在庆祝解放的十周年。工人们穿了节日的盛装，庆祝着自己的解放，怀着感激的心情纪念着我们伟大的解放者——苏联。在这一天他们要总结他们的工作和斗争以及在我们伟大的党——匈牙利劳动人民党领导下所获得的成就。他们准备迎接新的任务；保障建设事业顺利进行所必需的和平和自由。
    在历史上十年并不算是一个很长的时间，不过在这十年中，我国劳动人民在苏联和各兄弟国家的帮助下，在社会主义计划经济方面获得了巨大的成就。为了正确地认识这种成就，让我列举一些事实来说明我们是在什么基础上着手工作，又在什么条件下治理国家的。
    由于法西斯侵略战争的结果，我们所继承的是一个残破不堪的国家。由于战争的破坏，国家的财富丧失了百分之四十五。我国的工业生产力降低到百分之三十至三十五，解放时，只有百分之十的工厂能够进行正常生产。百分之二十以上的农业设备遭受了破坏，一半以上的牲畜，百分之三十八的矿业和工业，百分之十八的住宅，百分之七十的机车，百分之八十的铁路车辆都被毁坏了。差不多所有的桥梁全给炸毁了。十六万八千吨的工作母机、纺织品、皮革、药品、邮政和铁道设备都被劫运到德国去。更可痛惜的是在法西斯的侵略下，我们牺牲了四十万人的生命。当时的国家真是百孔千疮，但我国劳动人民并没有被困难所吓倒，他们抱着希望和信心，把领导权接收过来，在废墟上重新建设。反动派不相信也不参加这项工作。匈牙利共产党计划在三年内重建匈牙利，他们认为是不可能的。照他们的看法，要重建匈牙利，非靠美国的援助不可，即使这样，至少也需要三十年的时间。今天，大家都知道：匈牙利的工人们，已在两年零五个月中完成了匈牙利共产党原来计划需要三年完成的国家建设工作，当然并没有什么美国的援助。
    三年计划胜利完成以后，我们即开始执行以国家工业化为目标的五年计划。因此，一九五三年的工业产量已超过一九三八年的三倍半。匈牙利已从一个以农业为主的国家发展成为一个工业国了。工业方面最主要的基本物资的生产，已超过匈牙利战前工业产量最高水平数倍以上；例如：电力增加百分之三二七·五，钢百分之二三三·四，生铁百分之二一三·七，煤百分之二二七·五。在政府新纲领的范围内，消费品的生产已经大大地提高了。投入消费品生产的资金一直不断增加。
    在五年计划中，已建立了六十五个新工厂，其中六十个已在头四年里投入生产。最主要的新工厂属于重工业部门的计有：斯大林瓦罗什铁厂，伊诺特发电厂，维斯勃列姆染料厂，金基什铁道道岔厂，哈都萨尔化学工厂。属于轻工业部门的计有：赛格特纺织厂，克洛什瓦尔棉纺厂，查拉格尔塞格制衣厂，克乞克美特冷藏器厂，索尔诺克机制面包厂等。战前从国外进口的许多物品，我们已在五年计划中开始制造了。电气化方面也有了很大的进展。我国发电厂的发电量已使我国电力的使用逐渐增加。在一九五三年底，匈牙利百分之七十的农村已得到电力的供应。
    在公共卫生设施方面有了相当的发展。在三年计划中，医院改建了一百七十一所，重建了二十九所，还有一百八十六所添置了补充设备。在过去四年中，医院的收容额增加了百分之十三·五，产科医院的收容额增加了百分之六九·三。住宅建筑亦在加速进行。一九五四年中，国家建筑了住宅两万幢。
    经过土地改革，三百一十三万五千公顷的土地已经分配给缺乏土地的农民。我国的农民合作运动正在蓬勃发展。实际上，匈牙利农业已经有百分之四十属于社会主义成分。我国国营机器站现在为农民的合作社代耕的土地面积，比一九五零年增加三倍，为个体小农户代耕的土地面积增加到五倍以上。现在匈牙利有三百七十五个农业机器站。
    我们的党——匈牙利劳动人民党特别关怀着人民文化水平的提高。我国已经成为人人读书的国家。一九五四年，出版的书籍达二千七百五十种之多，共计两千万册，其中小说作品比一九五三年增加了百分之十三，青年读物增加了百分之二十九，报纸的发行额为一九四九年的一倍半。
    一九四五年以来，每年都开办了无数的图书馆。到一九五四年，已开放了地方公共图书馆三千九百四十九所。文化团体的组织也有了很大的发展。一九五四年已有文化宫和文化馆一千八百八十三所，等于一九五零年的一倍半。同时，收音机登记证的增加，也反映了城乡居民对文化兴趣的提高。一九三八年领到收音机登记证的，只有四十一万九千二百十一人，到一九五三年收音机登记证的数目达到了一百零七万九千六百张，一九五四年达到一百二十七万零二百张。
    匈牙利国民教育的进展，可以用事实来说明。一九五四年八年制国民学校的学生人数，比一九三八年增加了百分之十以上，参加入学考试的人数也增加了百分之一百四十三。青年入大学的人数也不断增加。大学和专科学校在一九五四——一九五五学年共有学生四万七千四百五十四人，而在一九三八年仅有一万一千七百四十七人。
    国家对于科学的每一部门、学者和科学家的巨大帮助，在匈牙利文化史上是空前未有的。匈牙利科学家在各方面的成就，证明这种广泛的帮助并没有落空。
    过去十年来，人民所享受到的社会福利和公共卫生设备有了巨大的改进。一九五四年社会保险制度下的受益人数，比一九三八年增加了一倍以上。同时，公用事业在数量上和质量上也有了同样的发展，例如休养胜地在假日举行减价优待等。
    亲爱的同志们，在这篇短短的讲话中，要列举过去十年的种种成就是不可能的。我刚才只选择了一些最重要的成果，来说明由于解放才使得我们可能获得成就。拿这些事实来研究一下，可以清楚地看到，解放给我们劳动人民所带来的幸福是多么大。匈牙利成为一个自由独立的国家，劳动人民从过去的统治阶级手中接收了国家领导权，并且消灭了剥削和贫困。在我国失业现象已不存在，宪法保障了每个人的劳动权利。土地改革满足了三百万贫农最迫切的要求。过去的银行专事夺取农民的财产、房屋和他们的每一寸土地，到了现在，农民对它们不必再有所恐惧了。我们的知识分子已成为祖国生气勃勃的人物，他们口袋里装着证明文件，不会再挨饿，不会再失业了。
    由于苏联的帮助，匈牙利在外交政策方面的成就是不可估计的。早在一九四五年八月十七日，苏联和匈牙利签订了第一个苏匈贸易协定，一九四八年二月十八日，又缔结了具有重大的意义的苏匈友好合作互助条约，提高了匈牙利在国际上的声望。此后，我们也和其他国家签订了同样性质的条约，从而使我们的独立和保卫和平的事业建筑在稳固而不可动摇的基础上了。这些条约建筑在平等、真诚互助的愿望和保卫和平的基础上，与帝国主义国家之间所订立的“同盟”、与美帝国主义者怀着侵略的意图所拼凑的侵略集团是完全不同的。这些条约对于进一步巩固和平阵营，防止美帝国主义变本加厉的侵略计划是有贡献的。
    深深尝到过压迫和战争灾难的匈牙利人民心中深刻地认识到，他们必须警惕地保卫他们的民族独立，为保卫和平而努力斗争。匈牙利政府的外交政策，得到了匈牙利人民坚决一致、心诚意悦的拥护。这个政策服务于两个目标：一是保卫和平，一是保障民族独立。匈牙利愿意同世界上其他国家的人民合作，因为它相信，只要有关双方都能一贯尊重对方的利益，这种合作定会产生美满的结果。所以匈牙利人民共和国对于匈牙利和其他国家间建立友好关系，采取了主动，将来也一定采取主动。匈牙利参加了各种国际组织的活动。匈牙利政府和匈牙利各种团体加入了一百四十多个国际组织。在一九五四年，匈牙利派代表出席了一百七十个国际性的会议。
    匈牙利加入联合国组织的合理要求，由于美利坚合众国的敌对态度，到今天仍遭到了拒绝。虽然如此，匈牙利人民共和国仍旧利用每一机会，按照联合国宪章的精神来推进联合国的工作。因此匈牙利欣然接受了和平利用原子能国际会议的邀请，愿意在会上积极参加实现原子武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的管制工作。匈牙利人民怀着不安和愤慨的心情注视着帝国主义者要使德国侵略恢复和重新武装德国的企图。由于过去惨痛的经验，我们知道德国军国主义的复活对我们将会产生什么后果。为了和平和集体安全，在去年十一月莫斯科举行的会议上，匈牙利和其他爱好和平国家的政府共同发表了一个宣言，提出了关于保卫世界和平的建议。
    在外交方面，我国和中华人民共和国建立的贸易和文化关系，是一重大事件。我们两国虽然相距很远，但在自由人民大家庭中，为了建设社会主义和保卫和平的共同目标而进行合作，这是很值得兴奋的。
    匈牙利全国人民看到伟大的中国人民在外交政策上所获得的重大成就，看到中华人民共和国的对外和贸易关系的日益发展，感到非常喜悦。这种事实证明了尽管美帝国主义想尽一切办法，来阻挠中国人民对于和平事业的努力，但中华人民共和国跟我国一样，愿意同任何国家和平共处。
    我们匈牙利人民，我想，连同全世界的人民，都需要和平，甚至美国工人们也都在谴责美国政府的侵略政策。我们深信人民爱好正义的力量的日益强大，必会阻止这些侵略的企图。凡是头脑清醒的人都会认识到，美蒋条约只符合于那些为榨取巨额利润而制造战争者的利益。这十年来，匈牙利人民一直过着自由幸福的生活，他们已经了解自由的重大意义。
    因此，我们谴责美国侵占台湾的政策，以及旨在压迫其他民族的一切行动。
    我国人民以关切的心情重视着中国人民在农业、工业和文化方面所获得的巨大成就。
    和一九四九年相比，中华人民共和国在一九五四年所生产的电力增加到二点五倍，煤炭增加到二点六倍，生铁增加到十二点四倍，钢增加到十三点七倍，水泥增加到七点二倍。
    这些数字不仅意味着中华人民共和国力量的加强，同时也意味着整个和平阵营力量的加强。我们既认为是伟大的中国人民的朋友，因此而引以自豪。中国人民正在同帝国主义者的侵略政策进行着无情的斗争；他们的热爱自由，也就日益显明了。我们的合作，我们和平阵营的强大力量，就是保卫我们的和平和独立的保证。
    匈中两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
    和平阵营的领导者苏联万岁！
    和平万岁！
