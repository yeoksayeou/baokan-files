Another Example of Peaceful Negotiation to Resolve International Issues

The Chinese government and the Indonesian government, based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect, and in a spirit of friendly cooperation and mutual understanding, have, after full consultation, signed the Treaty between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia on the Issue of Dual Nationality in Bandung, Indonesia, on April 22. The two countries have also issued a communiqu√© on the negotiations.

The agreement and signing of the treaty on the issue of dual nationality between our government and the Indonesian government during the Asian-African Conference is a victory for the spirit of seeking common ground at the Asian-African Conference, and a good example of resolving international issues through peaceful negotiation. The rational resolution of this issue not only conforms to the vital interests of overseas Chinese and helps promote friendship between the two peoples and the development of diplomatic relations between the two countries, but also makes an important contribution to promoting peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese people warmly congratulate the signing of this treaty and fully support it.

The issue of dual nationality is a practical problem that exists among overseas Chinese. Our government is willing to negotiate with relevant countries on a fair and reasonable basis to resolve this issue. Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his government work report at the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China: "The issue of the nationality of overseas Chinese is a problem that the past reactionary governments of China have consistently failed to resolve. This puts overseas Chinese in a difficult situation and has often caused discord between China and the countries concerned in the past. In order to improve this situation, we are prepared to resolve this issue, and are prepared to first resolve this issue with Southeast Asian countries with which we have already established diplomatic relations." The agreement reached between our government and the Indonesian government on the issue of dual nationality is a concrete implementation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which China has consistently advocated, in handling international affairs. It demonstrates that both our government and the Indonesian government have a sincere desire for friendly cooperation and for resolving international issues through consultation.

The issue of dual nationality among overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia has a long historical origin. According to Chinese historical records, the friendly exchanges between the Chinese people and the Indonesian people can be traced back more than 1,500 years. However, the issue of dual nationality did not arise in those years. The emergence of this issue was after the Dutch colonialists invaded Indonesia in 1602. According to a letter from Jan Pieterszoon Coen, the first Dutch Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, to his successor, Carel Reyniersz, in 1623, Dutch colonialists conducted large-scale immigration along the coast of China to solve the shortage of local labor, and forced overseas Chinese to settle in Indonesia. Later, in order to consolidate their enslavement rule in Indonesia, the Dutch colonialists regarded overseas Chinese born locally as Dutch subjects. In 1910, the Dutch government promulgated a so-called "Law on the Status of Dutch Subjects," which officially stipulated that all original residents of Dutch colonies and non-original residents born locally were Dutch subjects. Therefore, overseas Chinese born in Indonesia during the Dutch rule were unilaterally defined as Dutch subjects. Thus, the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia arose.

It is inherently unreasonable for overseas Chinese to have dual nationality. This not only makes it difficult for our country to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, but also often puts overseas Chinese in a difficult position in local countries. In particular, American and British imperialists and their running dogs often use the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese to create disputes and discord among our overseas Chinese, and to provoke relations between our country and the countries where overseas Chinese reside. However, the resolution of the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese cannot be unilaterally determined. It must be resolved fairly and reasonably through friendly consultations between our country and the countries where overseas Chinese reside, based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. This is also in line with the vital interests of overseas Chinese with dual nationality. In the past, the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese between our country and Indonesia remained unresolved for a long time because our country was in a semi-colonial position from the Qing Dynasty to the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and they did not care about the interests of overseas Chinese. At that time, Indonesia was also under the rule of Dutch colonialists, so the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese could not be resolved fairly and reasonably. But today, the situation has undergone fundamental changes. Our country has completely gotten rid of its semi-colonial status and become an independent and sovereign country, and Indonesia has also declared its independence. Due to the increasing development of friendly relations between the two countries, the two governments have been able to negotiate and resolve the issue of dual nationality of the overseas Chinese on the basis of the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in internal affairs.

Overseas Chinese have resided in Indonesia for a long time, giving birth to children and passing on from generation to generation, making significant contributions to the development of local resources and the development of local social economy and culture, and have also fought alongside the local people in many struggles against colonialist enslavement rule. They have close relations with the local people in Indonesia's socio-economic life. After the implementation of the treaty on the issue of dual nationality between the two countries, it is completely understandable that some overseas Chinese will choose Indonesian nationality. The Chinese people will respect their voluntary choice and will maintain sincere friendship with them. However, it is foreseeable that after the choice of nationality, there may be some problems between overseas Chinese and Indonesian Chinese due to the close economic and cultural ties in the past, which need to be adjusted according to the current new situation. For such problems, overseas Chinese and Indonesian Chinese should conduct friendly consultations in the spirit of mutual assistance, mutual concession, and mutual care, and seek proper solutions. The Chinese people and the Indonesian people have a long history of friendly relations, and overseas Chinese and Indonesian Chinese should also maintain and continuously enhance this friendship forever, so as to cooperate closely forever, thereby further promoting the friendly relations between China and Indonesia.

Protecting the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese is an established policy stipulated in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Our government will definitely protect overseas Chinese who have chosen Chinese nationality in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. At the same time, these overseas Chinese should also strengthen their unity, love their motherland, and get along better with the local people in a friendly manner. Overseas Chinese should respect local customs and laws and should not participate in local political disputes. We must always be vigilant against the few special agents and henchmen of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique who are mixed in with the overseas Chinese, expose their faces, and never allow them to provoke disunity among the overseas Chinese and undermine the friendly relations between the Chinese people and the Indonesian people. At the same time, the Chinese people also hope that the Indonesian government, on the basis of friendly cooperation with our country, will correctly implement the treaty on the issue of dual nationality between the two countries and protect the legitimate rights and interests of our overseas Chinese.

For several years, the American aggressive clique has always used the issue of overseas Chinese to sow discord between our country and various Asian countries. At the same time, some countries have actually believed in the malicious propaganda of the United States and have used various methods to exclude and persecute our overseas Chinese. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is still using a very small number of overseas Chinese to carry out sabotage activities against the countries where they reside. This situation is detrimental to those countries themselves and is of no benefit to peaceful cooperation between Asian countries. We hope that these countries will abandon this policy and respect the legitimate rights and interests of our overseas Chinese. Premier Zhou Enlai said in his speech at the Asian-African Conference, "The People's Government of New China is prepared to resolve the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese with the governments of the countries concerned." This position of our government should be able to eliminate various doubts caused by historical and external reasons, and make this issue move towards a complete resolution with other relevant countries as well.

The treaty on the issue of dual nationality signed between our government and the government of the Republic of Indonesia is a major achievement in the peaceful negotiation and resolution of international issues between our two countries. This proves that as long as there is a willingness for friendly cooperation, any problems existing between countries can be resolved reasonably through peaceful negotiation.
