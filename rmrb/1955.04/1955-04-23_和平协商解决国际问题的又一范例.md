Another Example of Peaceful Negotiation to Resolve International Issues

The Chinese government and the Indonesian government, based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect, and in a spirit of friendly cooperation and mutual understanding, have, after full consultation, signed the Treaty between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia on the Issue of Dual Nationality in Bandung, Indonesia, on April 22. The two countries have also issued a communiqué on the negotiations.

The agreement and signing of the treaty on the issue of dual nationality between our government and the Indonesian government during the Asian-African Conference is a victory for the spirit of seeking common ground at the Asian-African Conference, and a good example of resolving international issues through peaceful negotiation. The rational resolution of this issue not only conforms to the vital interests of overseas Chinese and helps promote friendship between the two peoples and the development of diplomatic relations between the two countries, but also makes an important contribution to promoting peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese people warmly congratulate the signing of this treaty and fully support it.

The issue of dual nationality is a practical problem that exists among overseas Chinese. Our government is willing to negotiate with relevant countries on a fair and reasonable basis to resolve this issue. Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his government work report at the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China: "The issue of the nationality of overseas Chinese is a problem that the past reactionary governments of China have consistently failed to resolve. This puts overseas Chinese in a difficult situation and has often caused discord between China and the countries concerned in the past. In order to improve this situation, we are prepared to resolve this issue, and are prepared to first resolve this issue with Southeast Asian countries with which we have already established diplomatic relations." The agreement reached between our government and the Indonesian government on the issue of dual nationality is a concrete implementation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which China has consistently advocated, in handling international affairs. It demonstrates that both our government and the Indonesian government have a sincere desire for friendly cooperation and for resolving international issues through consultation.

The issue of dual nationality among overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia has a long historical origin. According to Chinese historical records, the friendly exchanges between the Chinese people and the Indonesian people can be traced back more than 1,500 years. However, the issue of dual nationality did not arise in those years. The emergence of this issue was after the Dutch colonialists invaded Indonesia in 1602. According to a letter from Jan Pieterszoon Coen, the first Dutch Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, to his successor, Carel Reyniersz, in 1623, Dutch colonialists conducted large-scale immigration along the coast of China to solve the shortage of local labor, and forced overseas Chinese to settle in Indonesia. Later, in order to consolidate their enslavement rule in Indonesia, the Dutch colonialists regarded overseas Chinese born locally as Dutch subjects. In 1910, the Dutch government promulgated a so-called "Law on the Status of Dutch Subjects," which officially stipulated that all original residents of Dutch colonies and non-original residents born locally were Dutch subjects. Therefore, overseas Chinese born in Indonesia during the Dutch rule were unilaterally defined as Dutch subjects. Thus, the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia arose.

It is inherently unreasonable for overseas Chinese to have dual nationality. This not only makes it difficult for our country to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, but also often puts overseas Chinese in a difficult position in local countries. In particular, American and British imperialists and their running dogs often use the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese to create disputes and discord among our overseas Chinese, and to provoke relations between our country and the countries where overseas Chinese reside. However, the resolution of the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese cannot be unilaterally determined. It must be resolved fairly and reasonably through friendly consultations between our country and the countries where overseas Chinese reside, based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. This is also in line with the vital interests of overseas Chinese with dual nationality. In the past, the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese between our country and Indonesia remained unresolved for a long time because our country was in a semi-colonial position from the Qing Dynasty to the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and they did not care about the interests of overseas Chinese. At that time, Indonesia was also under the rule of Dutch colonialists, so the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese could not be resolved fairly and reasonably. But today, the situation has undergone fundamental changes. Our country has completely gotten rid of its semi-colonial status and become an independent and sovereign country, and Indonesia has also declared its independence. Due to the increasing development of friendly relations between the two countries, the two governments have been able to negotiate and resolve the issue of dual nationality of the overseas Chinese on the basis of the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in internal affairs.

Overseas Chinese have resided in Indonesia for a long time, giving birth to children and passing on from generation to generation, making significant contributions to the development of local resources and the development of local social economy and culture, and have also fought alongside the local people in many struggles against colonialist enslavement rule. They have close relations with the local people in Indonesia's socio-economic life. After the implementation of the treaty on the issue of dual nationality between the two countries, it is completely understandable that some overseas Chinese will choose Indonesian nationality. The Chinese people will respect their voluntary choice and will maintain sincere friendship with them. However, it is foreseeable that after the choice of nationality, there may be some problems between overseas Chinese and Indonesian Chinese due to the close economic and cultural ties in the past, which need to be adjusted according to the current new situation. For such problems, overseas Chinese and Indonesian Chinese should conduct friendly consultations in the spirit of mutual assistance, mutual concession, and mutual care, and seek proper solutions. The Chinese people and the Indonesian people have a long history of friendly relations, and overseas Chinese and Indonesian Chinese should also maintain and continuously enhance this friendship forever, so as to cooperate closely forever, thereby further promoting the friendly relations between China and Indonesia.

Protecting the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese is an established policy stipulated in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Our government will definitely protect overseas Chinese who have chosen Chinese nationality in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. At the same time, these overseas Chinese should also strengthen their unity, love their motherland, and get along better with the local people in a friendly manner. Overseas Chinese should respect local customs and laws and should not participate in local political disputes. We must always be vigilant against the few special agents and henchmen of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique who are mixed in with the overseas Chinese, expose their faces, and never allow them to provoke disunity among the overseas Chinese and undermine the friendly relations between the Chinese people and the Indonesian people. At the same time, the Chinese people also hope that the Indonesian government, on the basis of friendly cooperation with our country, will correctly implement the treaty on the issue of dual nationality between the two countries and protect the legitimate rights and interests of our overseas Chinese.

For several years, the American aggressive clique has always used the issue of overseas Chinese to sow discord between our country and various Asian countries. At the same time, some countries have actually believed in the malicious propaganda of the United States and have used various methods to exclude and persecute our overseas Chinese. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is still using a very small number of overseas Chinese to carry out sabotage activities against the countries where they reside. This situation is detrimental to those countries themselves and is of no benefit to peaceful cooperation between Asian countries. We hope that these countries will abandon this policy and respect the legitimate rights and interests of our overseas Chinese. Premier Zhou Enlai said in his speech at the Asian-African Conference, "The People's Government of New China is prepared to resolve the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese with the governments of the countries concerned." This position of our government should be able to eliminate various doubts caused by historical and external reasons, and make this issue move towards a complete resolution with other relevant countries as well.

The treaty on the issue of dual nationality signed between our government and the government of the Republic of Indonesia is a major achievement in the peaceful negotiation and resolution of international issues between our two countries. This proves that as long as there is a willingness for friendly cooperation, any problems existing between countries can be resolved reasonably through peaceful negotiation.

### 和平协商解决国际问题的又一范例

    和平协商解决国际问题的又一范例
    我国政府和印度尼西亚共和国政府，根据平等互利和互相尊重的原则，在友好合作和互相谅解的精神下，经过充分协商，四月二十二日在印度尼西亚的万隆签订了中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国关于双重国籍问题的条约。两国并已发布了关于谈判的公报。
    我国政府和印度尼西亚政府就双重国籍问题在亚非会议期间达成协议并签订了条约，这是亚非会议求同精神的一个胜利，这是和平协商解决国际问题的良好范例。这个问题的合理解决，不单符合于侨民的切身利益，有助于促进两国人民间的友谊和两国邦交的发展，而且对于促进亚洲和世界的和平，也是一个重要的贡献。中国人民热烈庆贺这个条约的签订，并全力支持这个条约。
    双重国籍问题是在华侨中间存在的实际问题。我国政府是愿意在公平合理的基础上同有关国家协商解决这个问题的。周恩来总理在中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的政府工作报告中指出：“华侨的国籍问题是中国过去反动政府始终不加解决的问题。这就使华侨处于困难的境地，并且在过去常常引起中国同有关国家之间的不和。为了改善这种情况，我们准备解决这个问题，并且准备首先同已经建交的东南亚国家解决这个问题。”这次我国政府同印度尼西亚政府对双重国籍问题所达成的协议，就是我国一贯主张的和平共处五项原则在处理国际事务中的具体实施。它说明了我国政府同印度尼西亚政府都有着友好合作、用协商方法解决国际问题的诚恳愿望。
    侨居印度尼西亚华侨的双重国籍问题的产生，已经有很悠久的历史根源。中国人民和印度尼西亚人民间的友好往来关系，根据中国史籍的记载，可以追溯到一千五百多年以前。但在那些年代里并不发生双重国籍的问题。这个问题的产生，是在一六○二年荷兰殖民者侵入印度尼西亚之后。据荷兰第一任驻印度尼西亚总督燕·彼德逊·昆在一六二三年致其继任总督卡宾德尔的信中说，荷兰殖民者为解决当地劳动力的不足，曾在中国沿海各地进行大规模移民，并强迫华侨在印度尼西亚定居。以后，荷兰殖民者为了巩固它在印度尼西亚的奴役统治，曾把在当地生长的华侨算作荷兰属民。一九一○年，荷兰政府颁布了一个所谓“有关荷兰属民地位的法令”，正式规定凡荷属殖民地的原有居民和出生于当地的非原居民都是荷兰属民。因此，荷兰统治时代居住在印度尼西亚的华侨侨生，就被片面规定为荷兰属民。这样，就产生了侨居印度尼西亚的华侨的双重国籍问题。
    华侨具有双重国籍，原是不合理的。这不仅使我国在保护华侨的正当权利和利益方面发生困难，也使华侨在当地国家经常处于困难的地位。特别是美英帝国主义及其走狗经常利用华侨的双重国籍问题，在我国侨民中间制造纠纷，引起不和，并挑拨我国同华侨所在国家之间的关系。但是，华侨双重国籍问题的解决，是不能片面规定的。它必须由我国同华侨所在国家根据平等互利的原则进行友好协商，才能够获得公正合理的解决。这也才能符合具有双重国籍的侨民的切身利益。过去我国同印度尼西亚对于华侨双重国籍问题的长期没有解决，是因为我国从满清直到国民党反动统治时期处于半殖民地的地位，它们不关心国外华侨的利益，而当时印度尼西亚也是处在荷兰殖民者的统治下，华侨的双重国籍问题当然不可能得到公平合理解决。但在今天，情况发生了根本变化，我国已经完全摆脱了半殖民地的地位而成为独立自主的国家，印度尼西亚也已经宣布独立。由于两国的友好关系的日益发展，两国政府就能够在平等互利和互不干涉内政的原则基础上协商解决华侨的双重国籍问题。
    华侨旅居印度尼西亚历史悠久，在当地生男育女，世代相传，对开发当地资源，发展当地社会经济和文化有着重大的贡献，也和当地人民一道进行过不少次反抗殖民主义奴役统治的斗争。他们在印度尼西亚的社会经济生活中同当地人民是有密切的关系的。在两国关于双重国籍问题的条约实施后，一部分华侨将选择印度尼西亚籍，这是完全可以理解的。中国人民将尊重他们的自愿选择，并将对他们保持真诚的友谊。但是可以预料到，在国籍选择之后，华侨和印度尼西亚籍华裔之间，由于过去经济和文化方面的密切联系，可能会遇到一些问题而需要根据当前新的情况加以调整。对于这类问题，华侨和印度尼西亚籍华裔都应当本着互助、互让，互相照顾的团结精神，进行友好协商，求得妥善解决。我国人民同印度尼西亚人民间有着悠久的友谊关系，华侨和印度尼西亚籍华裔之间也应该永远保持并不断地增进这种友谊，做到永远亲密合作，从而进一步促进中国同印度尼西亚两国之间的友好关系。
    保护华侨的正当权利和利益是中华人民共和国宪法上所规定的既定政策。我国政府对于选择了中国国籍的华侨，一定会按照宪法的规定加以保护。同时，这些华侨也应该很好地加强团结，热爱祖国，并和当地人民更好地友好相处。华侨要尊重当地的风俗习惯和法律，不能参与当地的政治纷争。对于那些混迹在华侨中的少数蒋介石卖国集团的特务爪牙，要随时提高警惕，揭露他们的面目，决不能让他们挑拨华侨间的团结，破坏我国人民同印度尼西亚人民间的友好关系。同时，中国人民也希望印度尼西亚政府在和我国友好合作的基础上，正确地贯彻两国关于双重国籍问题的条约，对我国侨民的正当权利和利益，予以保护。
    几年以来，美国侵略集团总是借口华侨问题来挑拨离间我国同亚洲各国之间的关系。同时，也有一些国家竟然相信美国的恶意宣传，用各种方法来排斥和迫害我国的侨民。蒋介石卖国集团至今还在利用极少数的华侨对所在国进行破坏活动。这种情况对那些国家的本身是不利的，对亚洲国家间的和平合作也毫无好处。我们希望这些国家放弃这种政策，尊重我国侨民的正当权利和利益。周恩来总理在亚非会议的发言中说，“新中国的人民政府却准备与有关各国政府解决华侨的双重国籍问题。”我国政府的这种立场，应该能够消除由于历史和外来原因而产生的种种疑虑，使这个问题在同其它有关国家之间也能够走向完全解决。
    我国政府和印度尼西亚共和国政府间签订的双重国籍问题的条约，是我们两国间和平协商解决国际问题的重大成就。这证明只要彼此都有友好合作的意愿，国家和国家之间存在的任何问题，都是可以通过和平协商的途径求得合理解决的。
