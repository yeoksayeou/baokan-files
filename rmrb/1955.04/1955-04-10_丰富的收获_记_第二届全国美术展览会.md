Rich Harvest
    ——A Record of the “Second National Art Exhibition”
    Tong Heng

Since the opening of the “Second National Art Exhibition” at the Soviet Exhibition Center in the capital, every visitor has felt that the hard work of New China's painters and sculptors over the past five years has yielded a rich harvest.

From the exhibited works, the achievements in traditional Chinese painting over the past few years are significant. Especially in the last two or three years, the number of works by Chinese painters depicting new themes has greatly increased. Many Chinese painters have gone into the lives of the masses, often engaging in sketching activities, giving full play to the characteristics of traditional painting, reflecting new things, and expressing their love for new things. The styles of imitating the past and fabricating ideas that were popular in the Chinese painting world in the past have obviously undergone fundamental changes in the last two years. Some of them depicted China's great construction and new scenes in rural areas and cities, such as Li Xiongcai's "Wuchang Shipyard Under Construction," Guan Shanyue's "Han River Railway Bridge Project," Pan Yun's "Spring Morning," Jin Lang and Li Zhenjian's collaboration "New Scenery of Lanzhou," etc.; some depicted the people's labor and life and healthy, optimistic emotions, such as Li Hu's "Visiting the Construction Site," Huang Zhou's "House Call," Tang Wenxuan's "Mother-in-law and Daughter-in-law Attending Winter School," Zhou Changgu's "Two Lambs," Song Yinke's "Mom, Look, I'm Driving a Tractor," etc. Many landscape and flower-and-bird paintings, such as Li Keran's "Painting Trip to the Summer Palace," Hu Peihang's "Beautiful Scenery of the Western Hills," Wang Shengsheng's "Tomato," Yu Feian's "Peony," etc., were also created by painters after observing, experiencing, and sketching in real life. Old painters such as Qi Baishi, He Tianjian, and the recently deceased Huang Binhong also participated with their works. At the same time, from the exhibited works, we also see that many young painters with a creative spirit have emerged in the Chinese painting world.

Oil painting creation has also made certain achievements in recent years. Here, it is worth mentioning the revolutionary history paintings. This is still a new attempt for our painters, but we have already achieved gratifying results. For example, Dong Xiwen's "Founding Ceremony," Luo Gongliu's "Chairman Mao's Speech on Rectification at the Party School in Yan'an in 1942" and "Tunnel Warfare," Xin Mang's "Chairman Mao Writing in a Cave Dwelling in Yan'an in 1937," Li Zongjin's "Seizing the Luding Bridge," Wang Shikui's "Peasants Joining the Army," Wang Liuqiu's "Huaihai Campaign," etc. These large-scale oil paintings vividly express the great historical events and deeply move the readers. Those landscape paintings that reflect the face of the motherland under construction also give the audience a deep impression. For example, Dong Xiwen's "Spring Comes to Tibet," Ai Zhongxin's "Road to Urumqi," Wu Zuoren's "Foziling Reservoir," etc., not only express the magnificent and lovely rivers and mountains, but also express the huge scale and victorious prospects of our socialist construction. In some works, painters also painted new societies and new characters, such as Li Zongjin's "Double Happiness," Wang Shenglie's "Reading," Zong Qixiang's "Emergency Repair," etc. From here, we get encouragement and education through concrete and touching artistic images. In addition, many authors of this exhibition are comrades from the army. The emergence of these military painters is worthy of our attention. For example, Xiang Tianye and Zheng Hongliu's collaboration "Hongshan Fort Battle," He Kongde's "Breaking Through Jiali Mountain and Cutting Off Hongyang Highway," Zhou Zuming's "Battle of Shangganling," Lin Ling's "Beside the Lancang River," Lou Puyi's "Search," etc., although there are still shortcomings in painting techniques, but because the authors have deep experiences and feelings in actual combat life, these works are real and full of life. Oil painting, in the field of our entire art creation, is relatively young. How should we seriously study the creative methods of socialist realism, master and give full play to the special properties of oil painting to express the major themes of all aspects of our lives, and create a style loved by the Chinese people, is an important task placed in front of oil painters.

Comic strips and New Year pictures are the most widely read and easily accepted by the masses. Since liberation, comic strips and New Year pictures have developed greatly. Many excellent works have been published continuously year after year, widely circulated among the masses, and played a great role in publicity and education. Among the comic strip works exhibited this time, such as Liu Jiyou's "Chicken Feather Letter," Wang Xuyang, Ben Qingyu, Tao Zhian, Lu Tan, and Zhou Li's "Child Labor," Wang Shuhui's "Romance of the West Chamber," Gu Bingxin's "Blue Tapestry," etc., are all extremely popular works. In recent years, comic strips have improved significantly in quality, and many authors have gradually formed their own styles. New Year pictures have also improved to a certain extent in recent years. The most significant achievement is the breakthrough of the seemingly fixed form of New Year pictures in the past, and gradually diversified. For example, some Chinese paintings and oil paintings, landscape paintings and revolutionary history paintings, etc., have also been adopted and printed into New Year pictures, which are very popular among the masses. Among the exhibited works, such as Wang Naizhuang's "Look at Those Two," Shang Husheng's "He is the Strongest Laborer," Zhang Fanfu's "Wedding Dress," Zhang Leping's "Mom Can Go to Production with Peace of Mind," etc., are all better.

Like New Year pictures and comic strips, comics and posters have played a great role in publicity and education among the masses in recent years. In coordination with the mass political movements and major domestic and international events since liberation, comics and posters have been active on the front lines in the posture of vanguards in the art forces. What is exhibited this time is mainly the original comics from the past year or two, and some have been redrawn and added with colors. Most of the comics satirize the despicable and shameless acts of American aggressors and their lackeys. Some of the comics that have recently been published in various newspapers and periodicals exposing the US-Chiang Kai-shek's aggressive conspiracy to occupy Taiwan have also been selected to participate in the exhibition. The works of Hua Junwu, Migu, Ding Cong, Fang Cheng, Zhong Ling, and Wei Qimei are all familiar to the audience. Among the posters, in addition to some works with the themes of promoting peace, Sino-Soviet friendship, resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, promoting the general line, promoting universal suffrage, and promoting the Marriage Law in recent years, there are also many works, such as Gao Hong's "We Must Liberate Taiwan," Ha Qiongwen's "We Must Plant the Red Flag All Over Taiwan," Zhang Wenxin's "Always Waiting for Orders to Give the Aggressors a Heavy Blow," etc., are all recent new works.

The development of prints can be said to be booming in the past two years. After liberation, there was a period when print creation was not prosperous enough. After the establishment of the Printmaking Group of the Creation Committee of the Chinese Artists Association in 1953, it organized and promoted the creative activities of printmakers across the country, and held the National Print Exhibition in September last year, and the situation has changed. Color printed woodcuts are gradually increasing; in addition to woodcuts, some copperplate prints and lithographs have also appeared; in addition to the original printmakers, many young writers have appeared; there have also been improvements in terms of subject selection, expression techniques, and printing techniques. Some painters also have their own unique styles. On this basis, the works exhibited this time are relatively complete. Some works, such as Gu Yuan's "Writing to Dear Chairman Mao," Yan Han's "Freshly Picked Apples," Zhang Yangxi's "Pastoral Song," Li Huanmin's "Weaving a Flower Blanket," Lin Jun's "At the Foot of the Miao Mountains," etc., have been published in newspapers and magazines, and readers have had good reactions.

Watercolor and sketches, in the first few years after liberation, were also less created. Later, with the encouragement and advocacy of the Chinese Artists Association, requiring art creation to be diverse and let a hundred flowers bloom, and the National Watercolor and Sketch Exhibition was held last August, and various newspapers and periodicals also regularly published watercolor and sketch works. Many painters have begun to pay attention to sketching and watercolor sketching. In addition to the works of old watercolor painters such as Zhang Meisun, Guan Guangzhi, and Pan Sitong, the works exhibited this time, such as Tang Youchu's "Farmers Reading Newspapers," Xiao Shufang's "Young Pioneers," Lu Enyi's two sketches of naval life, and Wang Qin's "Folk Singers," are more popular among the audience. Among the sketches, Wu Dezu's "Your Family's, My Family's, All Belong to Our Cooperative," Chen Yin and Qin Zheng's "Exploring Baoshan," etc., have been well received by readers after being published in newspapers; many other rural sketches, Huai River control sketches, and Korean sketches, etc., are also the harvests of painters going into real life to understand, excavate, and process and depict in the past two or three years. As for illustrations, although the number is small in this exhibition, there are many excellent works among them. For example, Shao Yu's ink painting illustration of "Thousands of Mountains and Rivers," Li Hua's woodcut illustration of "Mr. Hua Wei," A Lao's charcoal painting illustration of "Little Eighth Route Army," Zhang Guangyu's brush painting illustration of "Biography of Patriotic Poet Du Fu," Huang Yongyu's woodcut illustration of "Xuefeng Fables," Zhang Wenxin's oil painting illustration of "The Story of the Young Pioneers," and pencil painting illustration of "Old Chimney," etc., are all works with their own characteristics. Illustrations still need to be greatly promoted and encouraged at present.

There are many more sculptures in this exhibition than in the past. There are sculptures in every exhibition hall. In addition to the works of sculptors Liu Kaiqu, Wang Chaowen, Xiao Chuanjiu, Zhang Songhe, etc., most of them are the works of young sculptors and their collective creations. Pan He's "Spare Time," Yuan Xiaocen's "Mother and Daughter Learning Culture," as well as several worker statues and some reliefs sculpted by students of the Sculpture Department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, are worthy of our attention and attention. Sculpture is a particularly young art in our country. In the future, the rapid development of the motherland will require our young sculptors to dedicate their greatest talents in many places. The works of folk artists, such as Zhang Jinghu's clay sculpture "Zhaojun Leaving the塞," Chen Heting's clay sculpture "Old Woman Interpreting Poetry," Qu Qian's pottery sculpture "Duck," Wang Fengzuo's wood carving "Qi Si Jin Wuzhu, Xiao Si Lao Niu Gao," Pan Yucheng's stone carving "Dancing for Peace and Friendship," Gao Jianxin's de-molded lacquer "Qu Yuan," etc., have been praised by the audience.

These nearly a thousand pieces of various art works from all over the country are exhibited on such a large scale, which is an unprecedented event in China's art world. Compared with the First National Art Exhibition in August 1949, this exhibition can highlight that the development of China's art cause in the past five years has been rapid and huge, and the improvement of the political and ideological level and artistic creation skills of artists is significant. What is especially gratifying is the large-scale appearance of young artists and the joining of folk artists, which has continuously expanded and strengthened the art team. The scope of subject matter for various art creations has expanded, the forms of expression have diversified, and sculptures, illustrations, watercolors, etc., which were less created in the past, have gradually increased. This is an affirmative harvest. Through this exhibition, reviewing these harvests and listening to the opinions of the broad masses, future art creation will be better promoted.

    丰富的收获
    ——记“第二届全国美术展览会”
    同衡
    “第二届全国美术展览会”，在首都苏联展览馆开幕以来，每一个参观者都感觉到：新中国的画家们和雕塑家们，五年多来的辛勤劳动获得了丰富的收获。
    从展出作品来看，这几年来国画方面的收获是显著的，特别是近二、三年来，国画家表现新题材的作品，已大大增多。许多国画家走向群众生活，经常进行写生活动，发挥了传统绘画的特点，反映了新的事物，表现了他们热爱新事物的感情。过去流行于国画界的摹古、臆造的作风，近两年显然地已经有了根本的改变。他们有的描绘了我国伟大的建设和农村、城市的新的景象，例如黎雄才的“武昌造船厂在基本建设中”，关山月的“汉水铁桥工程”，潘韵的“春之晨”，金浪、李震坚合作的“兰州新风景”等等；有的描绘了人民的劳动生活和健康、乐观的情绪，例如李斛的“工地探望”，黄胄的
  “出诊图”，汤文选的“婆媳上冬学”，周昌谷的
  “两个羊羔”，宋吟可的“妈妈，你看我在开拖拉机”等等。很多山水风景和花鸟画，例如李可染的“颐和园画中游”，胡佩衡的“西山丽景”，汪慎生的“番茄”，于非闇的“牡丹”等等，也都是画家在实际生活中观察、体会和写生后创作出来的。老画家如齐白石、贺天健和最近逝世的黄宾虹等，也都有作品参加。同时，从展出作品中，我们更看到国画界出现了不少具有创造精神的年青画家。
    油画创作近年来也有了一定的成绩。这里，值得特别提出的是革命历史画。这对于我们的画家来说，还是个新的尝试，但我们已经获得了可喜的收获。例如董希文的“开国大典”，罗工柳的“一九四二年毛主席在延安党校发表整风演说”和“地道战”，辛莽的“一九三七年毛主席在延安窑洞里著作”，李宗津的“强夺泸定桥”，王式廓的“农民参军”，王流秋的“淮海战役”等，这些巨幅油画，以生动的形象表现了伟大的历史事迹，使读者深深感动。反映了在建设中的祖国面貌的那些风景画，也给观众以深刻的印象。例如董希文的“春到西藏”，艾中信的“通往乌鲁木齐”，吴作人的“佛子岭水库”等，不仅表现了壮丽可爱的河山，而且表现了我们社会主义建设巨大的规模和胜利的前途。在一部分作品中，画家也画出了新的社会和新的人物，例如李宗津的“双喜”，王盛烈的“阅读”，宗其香的“抢修”等，我们从这里通过具体的感人的艺术形象，得到鼓舞和教育。此外，这次有不少作品的作者是部队里的同志，这些军事画家的出现，是值得我们注意的。例如向天野、郑洪流合作的
  “红山堡战斗”，何孔德的“突破加里山，切断洪扬公路”，周祖铭的“上甘岭战斗”，林聆的“澜沧江畔”，娄溥义的“搜索”等等，虽在绘画技巧上还有缺点，但由于作者在实际的战斗生活中，有着深切的体会和感受，因此这些作品真实而富有生命。油画，在我们整个艺术创作的领域内，是比较年轻的，我们应如何认真学习社会主义现实主义的创作方法，掌握和发挥油画的特殊性能，来表现我们生活各方面的重大主题，并创造为中国人民所喜爱的风格，是摆在油画家们面前的重要课题。
    连环画和年画，是读者最广也是最容易为群众所接受的。解放以来，连环画和年画有很大的发展。许多优秀的作品，连年不断地出版，在群众中广泛流传，起了很大的宣传教育作用。这次展出的连环画作品中，如刘继卣的“鸡毛信”，王绪阳、贲庆余、陶治安、路坦、周立的“童工”，王叔晖的“西厢记”，顾炳鑫的“蓝壁毯”等，都是流行极广的作品。近年来，连环画在质量上有显著的提高，不少作者都逐渐形成了自己的风格。年画在近年来也有一定程度的提高，最显著的收获是突破了过去似乎固定了的年画形式，而逐渐多样化了。例如一些国画和油画、风景画和革命历史画等，也被采用印成年画，很受群众的欢迎。展出作品中，如王乃壮的“瞧他俩口子”，尚沪生的“数他劳动强”，张凡夫的“嫁衣”，张乐平的“妈妈安心去生产”等，都是较好的。
    同年画、连环画一样，几年来在群众中起了很大的宣传教育作用的，是漫画和招贴画。配合解放以来历次群众性的政治运动和国内外各项重大的事件，漫画和招贴画，以美术部队中的尖兵的姿态活跃在战斗的前线。这次展出的，主要是这一、二年间的漫画原作，有的还重绘和添上了彩色。大部分漫画，都讽刺了美国侵略者及其走狗们卑劣无耻的行径。最近发表于各报刊的揭露美蒋霸占我台湾的侵略阴谋的漫画，也选出一部分参加了展览。华君武、米谷、丁聪、方成、钟灵、韦启美等的作品，都是观众所熟悉的。招贴画中，除近年来以宣传和平、宣传中苏友好、宣传抗美援朝、宣传总路线、宣传普选、宣传婚姻法等等为题材的一部分作品以外，还有不少作品，例如高虹的“我们一定要解放台湾”，哈琼文的“一定要把红旗插遍台湾”，张文新的“随时等待命令给侵略者沉重打击”等，都是最近的新作。
    版画方面的发展，近二年来可说是蓬勃的。解放以后，曾有一段时期，版画创作不够兴旺，一九五三年中国美术家协会创作委员会的版画组成立以后，组织和推动了全国版画家的创作活动，并于去年九月举行了全国版画展览会，情况有了转变。彩色套印的木刻作品，逐渐增多；在木刻之外，还出现了一些铜版画和石版画；在原有的版画家之外，出现了不少年青的作家；在题材选择、表现手法和印刷技术各方面，也都有了提高。部分画家并有自己独特的风格。在这样的基础上，此次展出的作品，因而是比较整齐的。有些作品如古元的“写给敬爱的毛主席”，彦涵的“刚刚摘下来的苹果”，张漾兮的“牧歌”，李唤民的“织花毯”，林军的
  “苗岭山麓”等，都已在报纸刊物上发表过，读者都有良好的反应。
    水彩和素描、速写，在解放以后的开头几年，创作的也较少，后经中国美术家协会的鼓励、提倡，要求美术创作也同样要多种多样、百花齐放，并于去年八月举办了全国水彩、速写展览会，各报刊也经常发表水彩和速写作品。许多画家都开始重视速写，重视水彩写生。这次展出的除水彩画老画家如张眉荪、关广志、潘思同等的作品外，汤由础的“农民读报”，萧淑芳的“少年先锋队员”，吕恩谊的两幅海军生活速写，旺亲的“民间歌手”等，都是观众比较喜欢的。素描、速写中，武德祖的
  “你家的、我家的、都是咱们社的”，陈因、秦征的“探宝山”等，在报纸上发表后，很受读者欢迎；其他许多的农村速写、治淮速写和朝鲜速写等等，也都是近二、三年来画家们到实际生活中去体察、发掘和加工描绘的收成。至于插图，在这次展览中，数量虽少，但其中不乏优秀的作品。如邵宇水墨画的“千山万水”插图，李桦木刻的“华威先生”插图，阿老木炭画的“小八路”插图，张光宇毛笔画的“爱国诗人杜甫传”插图，黄永玉木刻的“雪峰寓言”插图，张文新油画的“少年先锋队的故事”插图和铅笔画“老烟筒”插图等等，都是各有特色的作品。插图在目前还需要大大地提倡和鼓励。
    雕塑作品在这次展览中比过去多得多了，每一间展览厅里都有雕塑作品。除雕塑家刘开渠、王朝闻、萧传玖、张松鹤等的作品以外，大部分都是青年雕塑家和他们集体创作的作品。潘鹤的“课余”，袁晓岑的“母女学文化”，以及中央美术学院雕塑系学生们塑造的几座工人立像和一部分浮雕，都是值得我们注意和重视的。雕塑在我国是尤其年轻的艺术，今后祖国一日千里的建设，在许多地方需要我们年青的雕塑家献出最大的才能。民间艺人的作品，如张景祜的泥塑“昭君出塞”，陈鹤亭的泥塑“老妪解诗”，区乾的陶塑“鸭”，王凤祚的木雕“气死金兀术，笑死老牛皋”，潘雨辰的石雕“为了和平与友谊而欢舞”，高建新的脱胎漆“屈原”等，都受到观众的赞赏。
    这些近千件的来自全国各地的各种美术作品，如此大规模地展出，在我国美术界还是空前盛事。这次展览，跟一九四九年八月第一届全国美术作品展览会比较，可以突出地看到，五年多来我国美术事业的发展是迅速和巨大的，美术家们的政治思想水平和艺术创作技巧的提高是显著的，尤其可喜的是青年美术家的大批出现和民间艺人的加入，不断扩大和增强了美术的队伍。各种美术创作的题材范围扩大了，表现形式多样了，过去创作较少的雕塑、插图、水彩等，也逐渐增多起来。这是应该肯定的收获。通过这次展览，检阅一下这些收获，听取广大群众的意见，今后的美术创作将会更好地向前推进。
