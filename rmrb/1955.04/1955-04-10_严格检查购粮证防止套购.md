To the Editor:

    In checking grain unified sales in Tailai County, Heilongjiang Province, it was discovered that lawbreakers were using fraudulent means to illegally purchase grain. Wang Chengfu, the owner of a cart shop in the 16th Group, Third Street, Tailai County, once bought 200 jin of sorghum rice and removed a zero from the end of the Arabic numeral, changing it to 20 jin. Another time, he bought 150 jin of sorghum rice and erased the "one" in front, changing it to 50 jin. Zhang Xizhao, a resident of the 7th Group, Fourth Street, tore off the page in his grain purchase certificate where the grain purchase amount was recorded, and bought twice as much grain. Wang Lin, a resident of the 7th Group, First Street, deliberately crumpled his grain purchase certificate, making the writing blurred and impossible to identify. He even acted shamelessly and stubbornly claimed that he had never bought any grain at all. The Harbin Grain Bureau also discovered that Liu Yaxian, a resident of Nangang, had bought an extra 600 jin of grain. After careful investigation, it turned out that he had obtained the grain purchase certificates of two neighbors who had moved away, and thus one household illegally purchased the grain of three households.

    The fact that lawbreakers are able to illegally purchase grain exposes the careless work style of our grain supply department cadres. Grain purchase certificates are printed on thick drawing paper, and any alterations or tearing can be easily detected. The case of Liu Yaxian's illegal grain purchase in Harbin illustrates that the public security departments there only know how to issue household relocation certificates without simultaneously collecting the grain purchase certificates, which allows lawbreakers to exploit the loopholes.

    I suggest that all localities improve grain supply procedures, strictly inspect grain purchase certificates, and punish lawbreakers who illegally purchase grain.

    严格检查购粮证防止套购编辑同志：
    黑龙江省泰来县在检查粮食统销时，发现不法分子用欺诈手段骗买套购粮食，泰来县三街十六组大车店主王成富，有一次买了二百斤高粱米，他把阿拉伯字母后面的圈去掉一个，改成了二十斤；又一次他买一百五十斤高粱米，又把前面的一字涂掉，改成了五十斤。四街七组居民张喜兆，把购粮证上登记着买粮数字的那一页撕掉，多买了一倍的粮食。一街七组居民王林，故意把购粮证揉烂，使得字迹模糊，无法鉴别，他还撒泼耍赖，硬说一点粮食也不曾买过。哈尔滨市粮食局也发现南岗居民刘亚贤多买了六百斤粮食，仔细追查，原来他把搬走的两家邻居的购粮证弄到手，因而一家套购了三家的粮食。
    不法分子所以能够套购粮食，暴露了我们的粮食供应部门的干部有着粗枝大叶的作风，购粮证既是用很厚的道林纸印的，任何涂改、撕毁现象，是完全可以检查出来的。哈尔滨刘亚贤套购粮食一事，正是说明那里的公安部门只知签发户口迁移证，而不同时收回购粮证，这就让不法分子钻了空子。
    我建议各地应当健全粮食供应手续，严格检查购粮证，给骗购粮食的不法分子以处分。　长虹
