Vigorously Conserve Cotton Yarn
Mou Lan

    Conserving raw cotton is an important task for the textile industry. However, some cotton textile factories only focus on conserving cotton usage but not on conserving yarn usage, which still results in a waste of a large amount of raw cotton and a waste of the manpower and resources used in the spinning process.

    In January of this year, state-owned cotton textile factories in Shanghai used more than 20,000 kilograms of yarn above their quotas due to a lack of attention to yarn conservation. The weaving workshop of the Dalian Textile Factory wasted 17,000 kilograms of cotton yarn throughout 1954. Currently, some textile factories still have excessively long yarn tails left over when changing shuttles during weaving, or they do not pay attention to the quality of weaving, resulting in the production of defective cloth that is unravelled into one or two yards of recovered yarn. Especially in the yarn sizing workshop, several pounds of recovered yarn are often wasted.

    Why are many factories only satisfied with the conservation of cotton usage in the spinning workshops, and rarely, or even never, mobilize the masses to conserve yarn usage? This is because their understanding of the meaning of "conserving cotton usage" is still one-sided, thinking that it only means reducing the amount of cotton used per yarn, and not fully implementing the spirit of conserving cotton usage. Everyone must not underestimate this problem. We can calculate it: If a factory with 1,000 looms reduces the yarn tail by five inches each time the weaving workers change the shuttle, it can save 800 pounds of cotton yarn a year; if each worker watching the warping machine reduces the jointed yarn tails by three inches, more than 300 pounds of cotton yarn can be saved a year. A weaving factory in Tianjin, because it paid attention to saving recovered yarn, it was calculated that from March 1st to 24th, the factory saved cotton yarn to weave more than 200 yards of double-sided khaki cloth. From here, we can see that it is a small matter for one person to save a few inches of yarn, but accumulating the recovered yarn saved by thousands of people is a big matter!

    Cotton yarn is made from cotton after the hard work of many people and the expenditure of considerable financial and material resources. One pound of cotton yarn requires 1.1 pounds of cotton, and its price is 1.8 times higher than that of one pound of cotton. Wasting one pound of cotton yarn means wasting 1.1 pounds of cotton.

    Leaders of cotton textile enterprises and all employees, let us all correct this phenomenon of not paying attention to conserving cotton yarn. The state and the people require us to use raw materials more economically and produce more and better textiles for the country and the people with less cotton.

### 大力节约棉纱

    大力节约棉纱
    牟澜
    节约原棉是纺织工业的重要任务。但是，有些棉纺织厂，只重视节约用棉，而不重视节约用纱，结果仍然浪费了大量原棉，并且白白浪费了纺纱过程中所用的人力、物力。
    今年一月份，上海各国营棉纺织厂因为不重视节约用纱，使用纱量超过定额达两万多公斤。大连纺织厂织布车间，一九五四年一年就浪费棉纱一万七千公斤。目前，仍然有些纺织厂在织布换梭时剩下的纱尾太长，或者不重视织布质量，织出坏布一拆就是一、二码回丝；尤其是浆纱车间，往往一浪费就是几磅回丝。
    许多工厂为什么只满足于纺纱工场用棉量的节约，而很少甚至不去发动群众节约用纱呢？这是因为他们对“节约用棉”意义的理解还是片面的，认为只是减少每件纱的用棉量，而没有全面贯彻节约用棉的精神。大家绝不能小看这个问题。我们可以计算一下：一个一千台布机的工场，如果织布工人每次换梭时减少五吋回丝，一年就可节约八百磅棉纱；看管络经机的工人每人如减少接头回丝三吋，一年就可节约棉纱三百多磅。天津有一个织布厂因为注意了节约回丝，据统计，从三月一日到二十四日，全厂节约的棉纱已经多织出了二百多码双面卡其布来。从这里可以看到，一个人节约几吋纱线是小事，把几千几万人节约的回丝累积起来，就是大事了！
    棉纱是棉花经过了许许多多人的辛勤劳动，花了不少财力、物力才制造出来的。一斤棉纱要用一点一斤棉花，它的价格比一斤棉花要高一点八倍，浪费一斤棉纱就意味着浪费掉一点一斤棉花。
    棉纺织企业的领导者们和全体职工们，大家一齐来纠正这种不注意节约棉纱的现象。国家和人民要求我们更经济地利用原料，用更少的棉花为国家和人民生产出更多、更好的纺织品来。
