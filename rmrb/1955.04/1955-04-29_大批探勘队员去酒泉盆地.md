The Geological Survey Office of the Yumen Mining Bureau has more than 1,000 exploration team members who have successively departed for the Jiuquan Basin before mid-April to search for oil. A large number of vehicles and camels are transporting the instruments, food, machinery, and tents they need to the mountainous areas and the Gobi Desert.

This year, the exploration area in the Jiuquan Basin is very large. Exploration team members will work in the vast area stretching hundreds of miles from the Heli Mountains and Mazong Mountains in the north to the Qilian Mountains in the south. Their tasks this year are: mainly relying on geophysical exploration to find new oil-bearing structures on the ground and hidden underground; and to meticulously measure previously discovered oil-bearing structures in order to provide reliable data for further drilling.

In order to meet the needs of exploration work in the Jiuquan Basin this year, the Geological Survey Office has added many new exploration staff. Before departure, the exploration team members inspected all instruments, vehicles, machinery, and power equipment, and sent people to various places to purchase cooking stoves.

    大批探勘队员去酒泉盆地
    玉门矿务局地质调查处有一千多名探勘队员，已在四月中旬以前陆续出发到酒泉盆地，去寻找石油。大批汽车、骆驼，把他们需要的仪器、粮食、机器、帐篷，运往山区和戈壁滩。
    今年酒泉盆地的探勘面积很大。探勘队员将在北起合黎山、马鬃山，南至祁连山区的纵横数百里的广大地区里进行工作。他们今年的任务是：主要依靠地球物理探勘，找寻新的地面和潜伏在地下的储油构造；细测以往发现的储油构造，以便为进一步进行钻探提供可靠资料。
    为了满足酒泉盆地今年探勘工作需要，地质调查处增加了许多新的探勘工作人员。在出发前，探勘队员们检修了全部仪器、车辆和机械、动力设备，并派人到各地购置了锅灶。
