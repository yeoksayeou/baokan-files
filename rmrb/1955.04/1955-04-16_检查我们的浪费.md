    Check Our Waste
  　Li Hao, Director of Chongqing 507 Power Plant
    Recently, our factory conducted a waste inspection and found serious waste phenomena in business management, such as blindly stockpiling materials, extravagance, and disregard for costs. Over the past year, the factory's material backlog and waste amounted to 380,000 yuan, causing significant losses to state property.

    The main reasons for the backlog and waste are, first, the leadership's one-sided emphasis on being prepared for any eventuality, and a lack of cost reduction awareness. For example, at the end of 1954, a total of 9,600 tons of raw coal for boilers were blindly purchased, worth 28,800 yuan (now disposed of). Other items such as steel balls for ball mills, various cables, coal conveying belts, etc., also had serious backlogs, totaling 380,000 yuan. This amount of money could buy 14,000 tons of coal, which could generate approximately 25 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. This cost-insensitive approach demonstrates our lack of comprehensive understanding of completing national plans and establishing a mindset of managing finances diligently. We also did not seriously and conscientiously compile and review plans, leading to serious consequences.

    We have also done a very poor job in educating employees about cherishing public property. In January, our non-production electricity consumption reached 37,790 kilowatt-hours, equivalent to the power consumption of a small factory. Some comrades in the dormitory leave their lights on all night, thinking that it doesn't matter if they use more electricity since they generate it themselves. The phenomenon of freely taking public flower wire and light bulbs is even more common. There is a lot of waste from everywhere showing extravagance and generosity. For example, the Production Education Field planned to make 150 sets of work clothes for trainees at 16 yuan per set, which was handled by the Administration Section. The Administration Section had an existing inventory of 400 sets of work clothes, but they did not use them, instead ordering 150 sets of mercerized khaki work clothes at 17 yuan per set, causing serious backlogs and waste.

    Secondly, the great blindness in formulating plans is also a reason for material backlogs. For example, the Chemical Field, due to poor planning, blindly compiled a budget and purchased 16 pounds of pure iodine worth 2,576 yuan, enough to use for 600 years; and two bottles of potassium permanganate worth 160 yuan, enough to use for 200 years. Another example is the Repair Shop, which planned to use 200,000 yuan worth of materials in 1955, but after careful review, only 20,000 yuan was needed.

    The various systems are not sound, and the leadership only makes arrangements but lacks regular inspection of the implementation of the systems, turning the compilation and review of plans into a mere formality, with no one being held responsible. This is also one of the reasons for the various wastes mentioned above.

    Through this inspection, we have deeply realized that "bureaucratism is a breeding ground for extravagance and waste." In the future, we must first improve our leadership style, deeply understand the situation, seriously compile plans, and thoroughly and meticulously review plans. Based on the regular maintenance and repair of equipment and the original records of man-hours and materials used for regular major and minor repairs, we will formulate material consumption quotas; strengthen the management of financial supply, improve the workshop cost management system, material audit system, management system for material requisition and return, and additional change plans, as well as the management system for the compilation and review of annual, quarterly, and monthly plans. At the same time, we will educate all factory employees to save raw materials in all aspects and establish the concept of comprehensively completing national plans. In order to ensure that this work is done well, it has been decided that the factory Party committee and factory administrative leaders will take turns giving political reports to the workers once or twice a week, so that every comrade clearly recognizes the importance of saving and comprehensively completing national plans, fights against waste, and accumulates more funds for the country.

    检查我们的浪费
  　重庆五○七电厂厂长　李浩
    最近，我们工厂里进行了一次反浪费检查，发现在经营管理上存在着盲目储备器材、讲阔气、不计成本的严重浪费现象。一年来，工厂的物资积压和浪费达三十八万元，使国家财产受到了很大损失。
    造成积压和浪费的主要原因，首先是由于领导上片面地强调有备无患，缺乏降低成本的观念。如锅炉用的原煤，一九五四年底总计盲目的购进了九千六百吨，价值二万八千八百元（现在已处理）。其他如球磨机的钢球，各项电缆、输煤皮带等积压情况也是严重的，总计价值三十八万元。拿这笔钱可购买煤一万四千吨，能发电约二千五百万度。这种不计成本的做法，说明我们缺乏全面完成国家计划和建立当家理财的思想，也没有严肃认真地编制和审核计划，以致带来严重的后果。
    我们对职工进行爱护公共财物的教育也是做得很差的。一月份我们的非生产用电数竟达三万七千七百九十度，相当于一个小厂的动力用电量。宿舍内部分同志的电灯通夜不熄，他们认为自己发电多用点电没有什么了不起。至于随便取用公家的花线、灯泡的现象更是十分普遍。处处显阔气、讲大方，这样的浪费也是很多的。譬如生产教育场计划给培训人员做工作服一百五十套，每套十六元，由行政科代做。行政科原库存四百套工作服，他们不去利用，而以十七元一套定制了一百五十套丝光卡叽工作服，造成了严重的积压和浪费。
    其次，制定计划的盲目性很大，也是造成物资积压的原因。如化学场由于计划不周，盲目编造预算而购回价值二千五百七十六元的纯碘十六磅，可用六百年；价值一百六十元的高锰酸钾二瓶，可用二百年。又如修配场在一九五五年度计划要用材料二十万元，经过仔细审核，只要二万元。
    各项制度不健全，领导方面只作布置而缺乏对制度执行情况的经常检查，把编制和审核计划变成走过场，无人负责的现象比较严重。这也是造成以上各种浪费的原因之一。
    经过这次检查，我们深深地认识到：“官僚主义是铺张浪费的温床”。今后我们首先要改进领导作风，深入了解情况，严肃地编制计划和深入细致地审核计划，根据平时对设备的维护检修和定期大小检修的工时工料原始记录，制定材料的消耗定额；加强财务供应的管理，健全车间成本管理制度、材料稽核制度、领料退料和追加变更计划的管理制度以及年季月计划编制审核管理制度等。同时教育全厂职工从各方面节约原材料，树立全面完成国家计划的观念。为了保证做好这些工作，已决定由厂党委会和工厂行政领导干部，每周轮流给工人作政治报告一、两次，使每个同志都明确认识节约和全面完成国家计划的重要性，同浪费现象作斗争，为国家积累更多的资金。
