Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, April 22nd (Special correspondent report): Ceylonese Prime Minister Kotelawala, who led the Ceylonese delegation to the Asian-African Conference, held a press conference on the morning of April 21st to explain his attitude towards the Taiwan situation and the issue of peaceful coexistence to reporters.

Kotelawala advocated that Taiwan should break away from China and become an "independent country." He groundlessly claimed that Taiwanese people are different from Chinese people in terms of race and language, just like Britain is different from France. He even attempted to use history to prove that Taiwan has always been "independent," claiming that Taiwan had gained independence under the leadership of Zheng Jing in the seventeenth century. However, he does not know that Zheng Chenggong and his son Zheng Jing, famous fighters in Chinese history against foreign aggression, and the people under their leadership were not only 100% Chinese, but the entire purpose of their long-term struggle was to liberate the whole of China (not just Taiwan) from the rule of foreign aggressors.

It is on this distortion of facts that Kotelawala proposed to place Taiwan under international trusteeship. The whole world knows that this proposal to carve up China's territory and interfere in China's internal affairs has long been declared bankrupt in the face of just public opinion.

When talking about peaceful coexistence, Kotelawala repeatedly expressed so-called "doubts and worries" about "coexistence." He unscrupulously slandered the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries, even though these countries have never posed any threat to the existence of Ceylon. He attempted to portray the internal communist movements in various countries as irreconcilable with peaceful coexistence between countries. He said that he believes the prerequisite for coexistence is that every country should be able to freely choose its own government without any foreign interference, yet he actually demanded that China "publicly and formally ask local communist groups in Asia and Africa to disband." It is very clear that Kotelawala, starting from absurd assumptions about facts, cannot but fall into contradictions and confusion in principle.

The purpose of Kotelawala holding this press conference has aroused widespread suspicion here. People have noticed that Kotelawala suddenly appeared and held such a press conference behind the meeting's back while the secret meeting of delegation leaders was in progress. People have also noticed that Kotelawala already made the same statement at the delegation leaders' meeting on the afternoon of the 21st, going beyond the scope of the agenda. It is pointed out that the spirit of Kotelawala's speech runs counter to the purpose of convening the Asian-African Conference as determined by the Bogor Conference. Therefore, it is difficult to avoid suspecting that behind all this, there is a third party's conspiracy to undermine the conference.

    锡兰总理科特拉瓦拉在万隆举行记者招待会
    竟提出割裂我国领土干涉我国内政的主张
    新华社万隆二十二日电　本社特派记者报道：率领锡兰代表团参加亚非会议的锡兰总理科特拉瓦拉在四月二十一日上午举行了一个记者招待会，向记者们说明他对台湾局势问题和和平共处问题所持的态度。
    科特拉瓦拉鼓吹台湾应当脱离中国成为一个“独立国”，他毫无根据地说什么台湾人从种族上、语言上都不同于中国，就像英国不同于法国一样。他甚至企图引用历史来证明台湾从来就是“独立的”，说什么台湾在十七世纪曾在郑经领导下获得过独立。但是，他不知道中国历史上著名的反抗外来侵略的斗士郑成功和他的儿子郑经，以及他们所领导下的人民不仅是百分之百的中国人，而且他们所进行的长期奋斗的全部目的就是要使全中国（不仅是台湾）从外来的侵略者的统治下解放出来。
    就是在这种对事实的歪曲的基础上，科特拉瓦拉提出要对台湾实行国际托管。全世界都知道，这种割裂中国领土、干涉中国内政的主张早已在公正的舆论面前宣告破产了。
    在谈到关于和平共处的时候，科特拉瓦拉一再对“共处”表示所谓“怀疑和忧虑”。他肆无忌惮地诬蔑苏联、中国和各人民民主国家，虽然这些国家从来没有对锡兰的存在有过任何威胁。他企图把各国内部的共产主义运动说成是和各国间和平共处不能调和的。他说，他认为共处的先决条件是每一个国家应当能自由选择自己的政府而不受任何外来干涉，然而他却又居然要求中国“公开地和正式地要求亚非两洲各地的当地共产主义团体解散”。十分明显，科特拉瓦拉从对事实的荒谬假设出发就不能不陷于原则上的矛盾和混乱。
    科特拉瓦拉举行这次记者招待会的目的在此间引起了广泛的怀疑。人们注意到，科特拉瓦拉是在秘密的团长会议正在进行的时候突然出场来背着会议举行这样一次记者招待会的。人们也注意到，科特拉瓦拉在二十一日下午的团长会议上已经越出议程的范围而作了同样的发言。人们指出：科特拉瓦拉的发言的精神是与茂物会议所确定召开亚非会议的目的背道而驰的。因此，很难令人不怀疑在这一切的背后，隐藏着第三者企图破坏这个会议的阴谋。
