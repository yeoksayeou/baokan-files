To the Editor:

The facts revealed in the People's Daily reader's letter page on March 27, "Accusation of Ming Dejun and His Wife's Cruel Crimes of Abusing Children," are correct and have been extremely enlightening and educational for me. In the past, because my understanding of the seriousness of the criminal behavior of Ming Dejun and his wife was insufficient, and my handling of it was not serious enough, the influence of our Party and our army among the masses has suffered undue losses. In addition to seriously examining myself and learning from this incident, I have requested instructions from higher-level organizations to give me the punishment I deserve.

On January 18, I received a letter from the masses forwarded by the Political Department of the Military Region from the People's Daily Reader's Letter Department, accusing Ming Dejun and his wife of abusing children, and I was instructed to handle it seriously. Although I sent someone to investigate with relevant departments and ordered Ming Dejun to conduct a review, which after verification was completely true; however, in handling the matter, due to my low policy level, weak awareness of law and discipline, and leniency towards cadres, I mistakenly believed that Ming Dejun's work performance was generally acceptable, and he himself expressed his determination to correct his behavior. Therefore, I only gave Ming Dejun a general Party and administrative disciplinary action for this illegal behavior that lost communist morality. As for Yang Shulan, who forced her husband to abuse the children with her, I mistakenly believed that she was still raising two younger children and did not strictly question her, only suggesting that the local police station should discipline her. It has been proven that this handling not only failed to completely stop the crimes of Ming Dejun and his wife's abuse of children, but also failed to play the due educational role among the vast number of cadres and masses. Therefore, this handling was not serious and incorrect.

After reading the People's Daily's "Accusation of Ming Dejun and His Wife's Cruel Crimes of Abusing Children" reader's letter, I clearly realized the seriousness of the criminal behavior of Ming Dejun and his wife and the errors in my past handling. First of all, our bureaucratic work style is very serious. We did not widely collect reflections and opinions from the masses during the investigation and handling, resulting in some criminal behaviors not being fully discovered. Secondly, our understanding of the seriousness of Party discipline and state laws and the consistency of cadres' "life details" and "political qualities" was insufficient, which led to incorrect conclusions when handling Ming Dejun's crimes. We must learn from this incident, strengthen learning, improve ourselves, and improve our work. At the same time, we must continue to strengthen communist morality and legal discipline education among all cadres, improve ideological awareness, and wage an irreconcilable struggle against all illegal and undisciplined phenomena.

Regarding the criminal behavior of Ming Dejun and his wife, the Military Region Party Committee has decided to expel Ming Dejun from the Party and send him and his wife, Yang Shulan, to the People's Court for handling according to law. Yu Ping, the child who was abused by them, has been sent to a nursery for education.

    名德俊已被开除出党编辑同志：
    三月二十七日人民日报读者来信专页“控诉名德俊夫妇虐待孩子的残忍罪行”所揭发的事实是正确的，对我有极大的启示和教育。过去，因为我对名德俊夫妇这种犯罪行为的严重性认识不足、处理不严肃，使我党、我军在群众中的影响受到了不应有的损失。除我从这一事件中认真检查自己，接受教训外，已请示上级组织给我以应得的处分。
    一月十八日接到军区政治部转来人民日报社读者来信部的群众来信，控诉名德俊夫妇虐待孩子罪行，并责成我负责严肃处理。我虽然派人向有关部门进行了调查并责令名德俊进行检讨，经过对证完全属实；但在处理时因我的政策水平低，法纪观念不强和对干部姑息迁就，以致错误地认为名德俊工作表现一般尚好，本人又表示决心改正，因而仅把名德俊这一丧失共产主义道德的违法行为给予一般的党内和行政的处分；对于逼迫丈夫和自己一起虐待孩子的杨淑兰，竟错误地认为她还抚养着两个更小的孩子而未严加过问，仅建议当地派出所予以管教。事后证明，这种处理不但没有完全制止了名德俊夫妇虐待孩子的罪行，也不能在广大干部和群众中起到应有的教育作用，因而这种处理是不严肃、也是不正确的。
    阅读人民日报“控诉名德俊夫妇虐待孩子的残忍罪行”的群众来信后，我才明确的认识到名德俊夫妇犯罪行为的严重性与我过去处理中的错误。首先是我们工作中的官僚主义作风很严重，在调查处理时没有广泛地搜集群众中的反映和意见，致有些犯罪行为未完全发现；其次是我们对党纪国法的严肃性、对干部的“生活细节”与“政治品质”的一致性认识不足，致在处理名德俊的罪行时得出了不正确的结论。必须从这一事件中吸取教训并加强学习，提高自己，改进工作；同时在全体干部中继续加强共产主义品德与法纪教育，提高思想觉悟，向一切违法乱纪现象作不调和的斗争。
    关于名德俊夫妇的犯罪行为，已经军区党委决定，将名德俊开除党籍，连同其爱人杨淑兰一并送交人民法院依法处理；被其虐待的孩子玉平已送育儿园教养。
