The tasks of the two survey and design teams are as follows: In April, they will begin topographical surveying work in Golmud, complete 800 to 1,000 square kilometers of surveying by the end of June, complete the basic planning and design work before the end of August, and plan to start construction in September and complete it by the end of November in order to strive to solve the irrigation problem for next year's cultivated land. The Wutumeiren team will complete the surveying task of 800 to 1,000 square kilometers by the end of October, and complete the channel alignment and technical design work before the end of December. As for the wasteland survey team, it must survey 2,000 square kilometers in the western Qaidam area, of which the area of arable land to be searched for is 750,000 mu.

    青海省农林厅水利局组织了两个勘测设计队和一个荒地勘察队，分别去噶尔穆、乌图美仁和柴达木盆地西部荒芜地区进行农田水利勘测工作。三月十五日，两个勘测设计队已经出发。
    两个勘测设计队的任务是：四月份将在噶尔穆开始地形测量工作，六月底完成八百至一千平方公里的测量任务，八月底以前完成规划设计基本工作，并计划在九月施工，十一月底竣工，以争取解决明年耕地的灌溉问题。乌图美仁队在十月底完成八百至一千平方公里的测量工作任务，十二月底以前完成渠道定线及技术设计工作。至于荒地勘察队，要在柴达木西部地区调查两千平方公里，其中寻查可耕地面积为七十五万市亩。两个勘测设计队出发之前，省农林厅水利局特举行了欢送会。全体工作人员表示要战胜各种困难，完成这一光荣任务。
