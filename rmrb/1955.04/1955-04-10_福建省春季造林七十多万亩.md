    Fujian Province's major forest areas in the Min River basin and northeastern Fujian have completed their 1955 spring afforestation plan. A total of over 700,000 mu of timber forests such as Chinese fir and eucalyptus, and economic forests such as oil tea and tung oil trees have been planted. The leaves of the early planted young forests have already turned green.
    The vast majority of these newly planted forests are collectively planted and managed by cooperatives and mutual aid teams. This year, many agricultural production cooperatives in mountainous areas have specially organized forestry production teams to be responsible for afforestation and ensure survival. In Jian'ou County, Xiaokang Township, twenty cooperatives and mutual aid teams have planted 840 mu of young forests, and planted another 4,000 reserved seedlings in the forest, preparing to replant them in time to ensure no missing seedlings. Because advanced experience of close planting afforestation was adopted and planting was timely, the survival rate of young trees can generally reach more than 90%.

    福建省春季造林七十多万亩
    福建省闽江流域和闽东北一带主要林区，完成了一九五五年春季造林计划。共营造杉树、桉树等用材林和油茶、油桐等经济林七十多万亩。营造较早的幼林，树叶已经转青。
    这些新造的林，绝大部分都是合作社和互助组集体营造和集体经营的。今年山区的许多农业生产合作社专门组织了林业生产小队负责造林，并保证种活。建瓯县小康乡二十个合作社和互助组造幼林八百四十亩，又在林间插下四千株留养树苗，准备以后及时补植，保证不缺苗。因为采用密植造林的先进经验和植树及时，幼树的成活率普遍可达百分之九十以上。　（新华社）
