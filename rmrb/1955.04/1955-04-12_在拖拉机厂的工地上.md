    At the Tractor Factory Construction Site
    By Our Correspondent Zhang Jianhong
    One bright morning, I boarded a brand-new "Škoda" bus to go to the tractor factory construction site. The snow had melted, and the bus advanced on the dusty highway. After about an hour, we saw rows of tall buildings in light yellow, orange-red, and light gray. These were the dormitories for the workers of China's first tractor manufacturing plant.
    Spring has come to the tractor factory construction site, and a scene of large-scale construction before the factory building project is presented before us. Temporary roads paved with dark cyan cinders stretch out in front of us in a crisscross pattern. The construction engineering unit's soldiers, wearing grass-green uniforms, with their jackets open and sweat streaming down their faces, were laying thick black water pipes in the pipelines by the side of the road. Vehicles transporting construction materials sped back and forth on the dry dirt roads. Light railway tracks, stretching for thousands of meters, gleamed in the sunlight. Looking north from the parking lot for construction machinery, covering more than 20,000 square meters, the water tower that soared into the blue sky was faintly visible, and patches of new green wheat fields were dotted with crowds of people. They were the drillers of the factory area's foundation. Others were digging graves according to the markers planted by the drilling team. The heavy rumble of the road rollers, the rhythmic pounding of the tampers, and the clang of the spike-driving team's hammers, formed a magnificent and melodious song. In the evening, the electric lights shining from the windows of the tiered buildings, like stars in the night sky, showed people the prosperity of the corner of an industrial city about to be born.
    Seeing this vibrant new scene, it is easy to recall the difficult but glorious days that the people who built the tractor factory spent here last year.
    July at the tractor factory construction site is a season of much wind and rain. The mornings and evenings already had a strong hint of autumn. After the wheat harvest, the vast wilderness was quiet, but from the first day the construction workers arrived, a boiling life began here. Fire-like red flags were planted all over the bare land, and clusters of golden yellow reed mats were erected on the damp ground. These were the temporary new homes of the workers. They bought sorghum from the countryside to cook rice, and took water from the mud ditches to quench their thirst. The ground was slippery with mud, and their legs sank in and couldn't be pulled out. The materials for building the houses couldn't be transported in. They stood shoulder to shoulder in the knee-deep mud, passing tons of bamboo, wood, bricks, and tiles, one by one, from the parking lot at the main road to the construction site. But this was still too inefficient. The next day, the workers launched a heated "road grabbing" battle. Half a month later, they completed all the road works needed at that time. In order to speed up the progress of construction preparation, they went out with their tools before the morning mist had cleared, and did not return until the faint candlelight was lit in the sheds. Each of them did the work of several types of jobs.
    When the river froze, it was an unusually cold winter, rarely seen in previous years. People braved the severe cold of about minus twenty degrees Celsius and used a three-dimensional parallel flow operation method for construction. This was a new test. The wind howled, whipping up snowflakes, and people couldn't stretch out their hands even standing indoors because of the cold. Bricks soaked in water froze before they could be laid on the wall. The workers "topping off" the roof panels couldn't stand firmly. As for the concrete work, which was most afraid of freezing, it was as delicate as an infant and prone to all kinds of problems if not properly cared for. But all these difficulties did not overwhelm the workers building the tractor factory. Instead, they strengthened their determination to overcome difficulties.
    Zhang Maolin, nineteen years old, was originally a third-grade worker, but when he did high-altitude work, he could operate like an old worker and fight against the severe cold. Zhang Maolin said: "The tighter the wind and snow, the hotter our hearts, and the more energetic we work." Their gloves were frozen into ice shells, the bean-sized snowflakes stung their eyeballs, and the snow water penetrated their cotton clothes, chilling their backs, but no one was willing to come down to rest. Masons mixed the mortar with hot water to build the walls, caulkers used cement mixed with salt water to caulk the seams, and concrete workers used stoves and straw mats to keep the "platforms" warm. They thought of all kinds of ways to conquer the wind, snow, and severe cold.
    In those cold days, ensuring project quality was the first priority. So everyone cherished the results of every task. Foreman Yang Fulin, whenever his section poured a concrete platform, always guarded it day and night, inseparable from it, just like a mother caring for a newborn baby. His eyes were red from lack of sleep, his throat was hoarse, but he still sat next to the platform, unwilling to leave. The comrades in the concrete mixing team also overcame many unexpected difficulties. Once, when the third-floor platform of Building No. 5 was half-poured, the tap water suddenly had an accident, cutting off the water source for mixing concrete. The half-finished platform was about to freeze. More than fifty workers set out to find water. Some dug a large pit in the ground and melted the surrounding snow in it, and then used buckets to take the water out. Some gathered the water from the water cylinders on the construction site; others braved the biting cold wind at midnight, stepped on more than a foot of thick snow, and walked along the uneven, frozen roads, wobbling and swaying, to carry water from the nearby ditches back. Like creating a miracle, they carried one hundred and eighty or ninety loads of water in a short time, making the silent mixer sing again.
    As long as you go to the construction site, you will always feel that the workers here are a fighting whole. Whether they are soldiers from the south who participated in the Jingjiang flood diversion, or technical workers from East China, they are all comrades-in-arms as close as brothers and sisters. Those who walk fast always extend a helping hand to those behind. Wang Dalong's masonry team often had the strong helping the weak. The technical worker He Asan's group and the soldier Zhang Wenhan's group learned from each other with great success. He Asan's group felt that they should learn from the People's Liberation Army's spirit of hard struggle, and Zhang Wenhan's group regarded the technicians as respectable teachers and wanted to learn the skills to build the motherland from them. He Asan told me that Zhang Wenhan was his best and fastest-progressing apprentice. He said, "He couldn't build walls when he came, but after a month, he could build more than six hundred bricks of clear water wall in a day." Zhang Wenhan said that He Asan was a good teacher who could really help people. At first, Zhang Wenhan's walls were always crooked and had holes, which made him feel very painful. He Asan used the ten minutes of rest during his night shift to teach him the "mud pressing method" under the electric light. After a period of on-site construction practice, the walls built by Zhang Wenhan reached the standard of "horizontal and vertical, with full mortar." Now, he has also learned complex operating techniques such as making platforms, roof ridges, and hooking wall seams. A few days ago, he was rated as a third-grade worker.
    They love the motherland, and the motherland loves them. Every minute of their work progress receives the warm care of the people of the motherland. People support them with the best items. They use good quality bricks and tiles, high-quality cement from the Northeast, steel bars from the steel capital, and high-quality timber from the great forests of the Xing'an Mountains. They ride large buses with sofa chairs produced in Czechoslovakia to and from work. They can often eat rice, fruits, and fresh fish from the South. Farmers have planted a large number of vegetables and valuable fruit trees for them. The local government and people constantly send representatives to comfort them. When they overfulfilled last year's annual plan by 39.4 percent, farmers from Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Henan and other places wrote to them to express their gratitude and congratulations. The people who are building the tractor factory, growing up in the love of the people of the motherland, are confidently welcoming the upcoming large-scale factory construction project.

    在拖拉机厂的工地上
    本报记者　张健虹
    一个晴朗的早晨，我乘上簇新的“斯柯达”牌号公共汽车，到拖拉机厂的工地上去。积雪融化了，汽车在黄尘滚滚的公路上前进。约一小时光景，便看见一排排淡黄色的、橙红色的、浅灰色的高大的建筑物。这就是我国第一个拖拉机制造厂的职工宿舍。
    春天来到拖拉机厂的工地，一幅厂房工程大规模施工前的景色呈现在我们面前。铺着青黑色煤渣路面的临时公路，纵横交错地从我们面前伸展开去。穿着草绿军装的建筑工程部队的战士们，敞开衣襟，脸上淌着汗珠，在路边的管道里，铺设着黑色的粗大的水管。运送建筑材料的车辆在干爽的土道上来回疾驰。长达数千公尺的轻便铁轨在阳光下闪闪发光。从方圆两万多平方公尺的停放施工机械的停车场向北眺望，那耸入青空的水塔，隐约可见，一片片新绿色的麦野上布满了斑斑点点的人群。他们是厂区基地的钻探者。另外一些人正按照钻探队插在地上的标记挖墓。四处传来的沉重的压路机的??声，节奏鲜明的打夯声，以及那钉道队敲道钉的当啷声，组成一支雄壮悦耳的歌曲。晚上，层层栉比的楼房窗口透出的电灯光亮，有如夜空中的群星，向人们显示出即将诞生的工业城市一角的繁荣景象。
    看到这朝气勃勃的新的景象，便容易回想起修建拖拉机厂的人们，去年在这里渡过的那些艰苦而又光荣的日子。
    七月，在拖拉机厂的工地上是一个多风雨的季节。清晨和傍晚已带有很浓的秋意。收过麦子，辽阔的原野上一片宁静，但是，自从建筑工人来到的第一天起，这里便开始了沸腾的生活。火一般的红旗，插遍了光秃秃的土地，在阴湿的地面上，搭起了一簇簇金黄色的席棚。这就是工人们的临时新居。他们从农村里买来高粱煮饭，从泥沟里取水解渴。地上稀溜瀾浆，腿陷下去拔不出来，盖房子的材料运不进来，他们人挨着人，站在没过膝头的淤泥里，把成吨的竹木砖瓦，从停车的大马路口，一件一件地依次传递到工地。但是这样做效率毕竟太低，第二天工人们展开了热火朝天的“抢路”战斗，半个月后，他们完成了当时需要的全部道路工程。为了加速施工准备的工程进度，每当朝雾未散，他们就荷着工具出去，直到工棚里燃起萤萤烛火，方才归来。他们每一个人都做了几个工种的工作。
    到了河水封冻的日子，正是历年罕有的奇寒的冬季。人们冒着零下二十度左右的严寒，用立体平行流水作业法进行施工，这是一个新的考验。风呼啸着卷起雪花，人们站在屋子里也冻的伸不出手。一块块浸了水的砖，拿到手来不及砌上墙就结了冰，在屋面板上“结顶”的工人站不稳脚，至于最怕冻的混凝土工程，更像婴儿一般的娇嫩，照顾不好，就要百病丛生。但所有这些难题，都没有难倒建设拖拉机厂的工人们，反而加强了他们战胜困难的决心。
    十九岁的张茂林，本是三级工，可是当他做高空作业时，能和老工人一样操作，一样同严寒搏斗。张茂林说：“风雪越紧，我们的心越热，干的就越起劲。”他们的手套冻成冰壳，豆大的雪粒刺得眼珠发痛，雪水渗透了棉衣，凉到背脊，还是没有一个人愿意下来休息，泥工用热水搅拌泥浆砌墙，钩缝工用掺了盐水的水泥钩缝，混凝土工用炉火和稻草席子给“平台”保暖，他们想了一切办法，征服了风雪严寒。
    在那些严寒的日子里，保证工程质量是第一件大事。所以人人都非常珍惜地对待每一个工作的成果。工长杨甫林，每当他的工段浇灌了一块混凝土平台时，就像母亲爱护初生的婴孩一样，总是昼夜形影不离地守候着。他的眼睛因为缺少睡眠熬红了，喉咙嘶哑了，还是坐在平台旁边，不放心离开。混凝土搅拌队的同志也克服了许多意外的困难。有一回，五号楼第三层平台浇灌了一半，自来水突然出了事故，断绝了搅拌混凝土的水源。先灌的半截平台要冻坏了，五十多个工人出发去找水。有的在地上挖了个大坑，把周围的雪溶在里面，然后用桶把水取出来；有的把工地上积水筒里的水聚拢来；还有一些人，则迎着午夜透骨的寒风，踏着一尺多厚的积雪，经过坳突不平的冻结了的道路，一歪一晃地，把附近河沟里的水挑回来。就像创造奇迹一样，他们一会儿担来了一百八、九十担水，使沉默了的搅拌机重又欢唱起来。
    只要你走到工地，随时都会感到这儿的工人们是一个战斗的整体。不论是来自南方的参加过荆江分洪的战士，或是来自华东的技术工人，他们都是亲同手足的战友。走得快的人，总是向后面的人伸出援助的手。王大龙泥工组经常是能力强的帮助弱的。技工何阿三小组和战士张文汉小组互相学习很有成绩。何阿三小组觉得要学习解放军的艰苦奋斗精神，张文汉小组把技工看成值得尊敬的老师，要向他们学习建设祖国的本领。何阿三告诉我，张文汉是他最好的，进步最快的徒弟，他说：“他来时不会砌墙，过了一个月，砌清水墙一天能砌六百多块砖。”张文汉说何阿三是真能帮助人的好老师。起先，张文汉砌墙时砖总是歪歪斜斜，有窟窿。这使他心里非常痛苦。何阿三利用每天上夜班休息的十分钟，在电灯光下，摆着砖头，教会了他“压泥法”，又经过一段现场施工的锻炼，张文汉砌的墙就达到了“横平竖直，灰浆饱满”的标准。现在，他还学会了做平台、屋脊、钩墙缝等复杂的操作技术。前几天，他已经被评为三级工。
    他们爱祖国，祖国爱他们。他们每一分钟的工作进展，都得到祖国人民热烈的关怀。人们用最好的物品支援着他们。他们做工用的是品质良好的砖瓦，东北的上等水泥，钢都的钢筋，兴安岭大森林里的优质木材，他们上下班乘坐的是捷克斯洛伐克出产的有着沙发椅子的大型汽车，他们经常能够吃到南方的大米、水果和鲜鱼。农民们为他们种植了大量的蔬菜和贵重的果木。当地的政府和人民不断地派代表来慰问他们。当他们以超额百分之三十九点四完成去年年度计划的时候，浙江、江苏、四川、河南等地的农民都来信向他们表示感谢和祝贺。在祖国人民的爱戴中成长着的建设拖拉机厂的人们，正满怀信心地迎接即将到来的巨大的厂房建设工程。
