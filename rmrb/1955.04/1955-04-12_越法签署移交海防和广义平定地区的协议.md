The signatories were General Van Tien Dung, Chief Representative of the General Command Delegation of the Vietnamese People's Army, and General Debreuil, Chief Representative of the General Command Delegation of the French Union Forces.

According to the agreement, the French Union Forces will withdraw from the Haiphong area, starting on April 22nd, in eleven stages, with the entire withdrawal to be completed by May 16th. In this way, the famous city of Haiphong will be liberated on May 13th, and the Cam Pha and Hon Gai mining areas will be liberated on April 22nd and April 24th, respectively.

Simultaneously with the withdrawal of the French Union Forces from the Haiphong area, the Vietnamese People's Army will withdraw from the third zone of Quang Ngai Province and Binh Dinh Province in central Vietnam, from April 22nd to May 16th. The Vietnamese People's Army had already completed the withdrawal from the first and second zones at the end of last October and the beginning of this January. By that time, the military transfer and regrouping work stipulated in the Geneva Accords will be completed.

The Haiphong area to be liberated includes Haiphong City and the three provinces of Quang Yen, Kien An, and Hon Gai. This area has abundant coal mines and is rich in rice, seafood, and forest products. Haiphong City is the most important port in North Vietnam, and Hon Gai and Cam Pha, northeast of Haiphong, are the places where the famous "Hon Gai coal" is produced.

In the agreement on the military transfer of the Haiphong area, both parties agreed on the general principle that the work should be carried out in an orderly and peaceful manner.

Regarding the transfer of public agencies and public property in the Haiphong area, the General Command of the French Union Forces guaranteed not to destroy or damage any public property, and also guaranteed not to allow damage to the lives and property of civilians, nor to adversely affect local civil affairs by interrupting the activities of public agencies, reducing these activities to a certain extent, or any other means. The General Command of the French Union Forces guaranteed to take the necessary measures to try to return the property essential for these public agencies to carry out their work if these properties were taken away or destroyed after the Geneva Accords came into effect.

    新华社河内十一日电　关于北越海防地区和中越南部广义、平定地区军事转移和行政移交问题的协议，已经在十一日上午在琼溪的越南中央联合停战委员会办公处签字。签字人是越南人民军总司令部代表团首席代表文进勇将军和法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团首席代表德布勒比松将军。
    根据协议，法兰西联邦部队将自四月二十二日起，分十一个区撤离海防地区，到五月十六日全部撤离完毕。这样，有名的海防市将在五月十三日解放，锦普和鸿基矿区将分别在四月二十二日和四月二十四日解放。
    越南人民军将在法兰西联邦部队撤离海防地区的同时，从四月二十二日到五月十六日，撤离中越的广义省和平定省的第三段地区。第一段和第二段地区的越南人民军早已在去年十月底和今年一月初撤离完毕。到那个时候，日内瓦协定所规定的双方军事转移和集结工作就告结束。
    即将解放的海防地区包括海防市和广安、建安、鸿基三省。这个地区有丰富的煤矿，并盛产稻米、海货和林产。海防市是越南北部的最重要的港口，海防东北的鸿基和锦普是出产著名的“鸿基煤”的地方。
    在关于海防地区的军事转移的协议中，双方同意总的原则，即工作应当有秩序地并且平安无事地进行。
    关于移交海防地区公共机关和公共财产问题，法兰西联邦部队总司令部保证不摧毁或破坏任何公共财产，也保证不允许损害平民的生命财产，也不允许用中断公共机关的活动、把这些活动降低到某种程度或任何其他办法给当地民政事务造成不良影响。法兰西联邦部队总司令部保证采取必要措施，设法归还这些公共机关进行工作所不可缺少的财产，如果这些财产是在日内瓦协定生效以后被拿走或破坏的话。
