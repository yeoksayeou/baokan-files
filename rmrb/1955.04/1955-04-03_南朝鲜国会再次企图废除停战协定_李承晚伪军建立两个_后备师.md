　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 2nd – Seoul News: The South Korean National Assembly, controlled by the Syngman Rhee clique, passed a resolution on March 31st demanding that the sixteen countries that invaded Korea "cooperate to declare the armistice agreement null and void" and "continue to station" their troops in South Korea. This resolution will be submitted to the United Nations Command and the governments of the countries that sent troops to invade Korea.

　　The resolution baselessly slanders the Korean and Chinese sides, who have faithfully implemented the armistice agreement, and groundlessly attacks the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

　　This resolution was made after the U.S. Secretary of the Army Stevens, who came to the Far East to arrange the United States' war plans, conducted two days of activities in South Korea.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 2nd – Seoul News: The 32nd and 33rd "reserve divisions" of the puppet army newly formed by the Syngman Rhee clique under the instigation of the United States were formally established on March 29th.

　　Up to now, the Rhee puppet army has a total of 20 active army divisions, four "reserve divisions," and one naval division. Among them, four active army divisions, four "reserve divisions," and one naval division were established after the Korean armistice, with the equipment and training of the United States.

　　In a congratulatory letter to the two newly established "reserve divisions" on March 29th, Syngman Rhee revealed that the United States had recently agreed to increase the number of the expanding "reserve divisions" from ten to twenty in order to "await the opportunity" to re-launch military adventures. The puppet "Ministry of National Defense" clamored that ten "reserve divisions" would be formed ahead of schedule by the end of June.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 1st – According to a United Press International report from Seoul, the Syngman Rhee clique's "Minister of National Defense," Sun Won-il, said on March 31st that U.S. Secretary of the Army Stevens "promised to do his best" to enable the Syngman Rhee puppet army to obtain atomic weapons.

　　Sun Won-il's remarks were made after Stevens held talks with the Syngman Rhee clique's military leaders in South Korea a few days ago. His leak put Stevens, the instigator of atomic warfare who had returned to Tokyo, in an embarrassing situation. According to the International News Service, when reporters asked him to comment on Sun Won-il's remarks, he angrily refused the reporters' request.

    南朝鲜国会再次企图废除停战协定
    李承晚伪军建立两个“后备师”
    新华社平壤二日电　汉城消息：李承晚集团控制下的南朝鲜国会在三月三十一日通过一项决议，要求侵略朝鲜的十六个国家“共同合作以宣布停战协定作废”，并且把它们的军队“继续留驻”在南朝鲜。这项决议将交给联合国军司令部和出兵侵略朝鲜的各国政府。
    决议对忠实地履行停战协定的朝中方面进行了卑鄙的污蔑，并且毫无根据地攻击中立国监察委员会的捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员。
    这个决议是在到远东来安排美国的战争计划的美国陆军部长斯蒂文斯在南朝鲜进行了两天的活动之后作出的。
    新华社平壤二日电　汉城消息：李承晚集团在美国指使下新编的伪军第三十二师和第三十三师两个“后备师”已在三月二十九日正式成立。
    至此，李伪军已共有陆军二十个现役师、四个“后备师”和海军一个师，其中陆军四个现役师、四个“后备师”和海军一个师都是在朝鲜停战实现后，在美国的装备和训练下建立起来的。
    李承晚在三月二十九日给新成立的两个“后备师”的贺信中透露，美国最近已答应他把正在扩张中的“后备师”的数目从十个增加到二十个，以便“等待时机”，重新发动军事冒险。伪“国防部”扬言，十个“后备师”要提前在六月底以前编成。
    新华社一日讯　据合众社汉城消息，李承晚集团“国防部长官”孙元一在三月三十一日说：美国陆军部长斯蒂文斯“答应将尽他最大的力量”使李承晚伪军获得原子武器。
    孙元一的这次谈话，是在斯蒂文斯日前在南朝鲜同李承晚集团军事首脑进行会谈后发表的。他的这一泄露，使已经回到东京的原子战争的煽动者斯蒂文斯陷于狼狈的境地。据国际新闻社消息，当记者请他对孙元一的谈话表示意见时，他愤怒地拒绝了记者的要求。
