      The state-owned Beijing Southern Suburb Farm has been conducting cross-breeding experiments using fine rabbit breeds such as "Rex" and "Chinchilla" to breed many new rabbit varieties. These new rabbit varieties have beautiful fur colors, the fur and down are neat and dense, the body weight is three to four times heavier than that of ordinary domestic rabbits, the leather quality is more than twice as thick, and they have strong immunity and breed quickly. A pair of rabbits can breed a total of forty to fifty offspring a year, and fur rabbits can grow up in eight months. These rabbits are very easy to raise, and can be fed with just wild vegetables, vegetable leaves, bean dregs, and the like.
    China Animal Products Company has signed a contract with the Beijing Southern Suburb Farm to purchase all new rabbit varieties. This rabbit hair is the raw material for high-quality textiles, and the leather produced can be used to make various light, warm, beautiful wearing apparel.

    北京南郊农场饲育新品种兔
      国营北京南郊农场用“力克司”“琴祺那”等良种兔进行杂交试验，饲育出很多新品种兔。这些新品种兔，毛的色泽很美丽，毛和绒整齐稠密，体重比一般家兔重三、四倍，皮质厚两倍以上，并且免疫力强，繁殖较快。一对兔一年累计繁殖达四、五十只，皮兔八个月就可成长。这种兔子饲养很方便，只喂野菜、菜叶、豆渣等就可以了。
    中国畜产公司已同北京南郊农场签订了收购全部新品种兔的合同。这种兔毛是高贵纺织品的原料，制出的皮料，能做各种轻暖美观的穿戴用品。
