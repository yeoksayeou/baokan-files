The road construction workers along the Jining-Erlian Railway Line are nearing the end of winter construction. After a winter's work, the starting station of the Jining-Erlian Railway Line—Jining North Station—has already completed over 20,000 square meters of buildings for mechanical workshops, warehouses, offices, and staff dormitories. The two water towers at Wenduer Temple and Tumuertai, which began construction in September and October of 1954, are now 25 meters and 18 meters above ground, respectively. Braving wind and snow, the workers have also filled and excavated over 520,000 cubic meters of earth and stone on the lines and stations, laid 127 kilometers of rails and 127,000 cubic meters of ballast. The cement prefabrication plant used electric heating to prefabricate a large number of culvert pipes for construction use.

The quality of the winter construction is good. The water supply engineering team, working at high altitudes in temperatures of minus 30 degrees Celsius, used steam capillary maintenance to pour reinforced concrete tower bodies, and the quality is very good. The workers of the Second Construction Team used the Soviet advanced freezing method to lay bricks with full mortar, and the seams are straight, beautiful and neatly pointed. (Xinhua News Agency)

    集二线冬季施工临近结束
    集（宁）二（连）线沿线的筑路职工们正在结束冬季施工。经过一个冬天，集二线的起点站——集宁北站已经建成了两万多平方公尺的机械厂房、仓库、办公室和职工宿舍等建筑物。一九五四年九、十月份相继开工的温都尔庙和土木尔台的两座给水塔，现在已高出地面二十五公尺和十八公尺。职工们还冒着风雪在线路和站场上填挖了五十二万多立方公尺的土和石，铺了一百二十七公里的铁轨和十二万七千多立方公尺的道碴。水泥成品厂运用电热法预制了大量涵管，供给施工使用。
    冬季施工的工程质量良好。在零下三十多度的气温下进行高空作业的给水工程队，用蒸气毛管养生法灌注钢筋混凝土的塔身，质量很好。第二建筑队的职工用苏联先进的冻结法砌的砖灰浆饱满，抅缝平直美观。（新华社）
