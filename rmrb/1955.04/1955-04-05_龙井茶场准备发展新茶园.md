	Longjing Tea Farm Prepares to Develop New Tea Plantations
	To meet the domestic and international demand for tea, the state-owned Hangzhou Longjing Tea Farm purchased over 40,000 jin of tea seeds from the nearby Longjing premium tea-producing area and the Anhui tea region in 1954, which have now been sown. It is estimated that after these tea seeds are grown into seedlings, they can be transplanted into more than 800 mu of new-style tea plantations with row planting. In addition to supplying some of these tea seedlings to the Shifeng tea region for replanting old tea gardens, the remainder will be supplied to the Yuhang Shishe branch farm to develop new tea plantations.

    龙井茶场准备发展新茶园
    地方国营杭州市龙井茶场为适应国内外对茶叶的需要，一九五四年除自采部分茶籽外，向附近龙井名产区和安徽茶区收购茶籽四万多斤，目前已经播种完毕。这项茶籽估计将来育成茶苗以后，可移植成条播新式茶园八百多亩。这些茶苗除一部分将供狮峰茶区旧茶园用来补苗外，其余将供余杭石濑分场用来发展新茶园。
