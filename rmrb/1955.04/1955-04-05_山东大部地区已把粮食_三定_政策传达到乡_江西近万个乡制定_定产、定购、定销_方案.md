    Most Areas of Shandong Province Have Conveyed the Grain "Three Fixes" Policy to the Townships
    Nearly Ten Thousand Townships in Jiangxi Province Formulate "Fixed Production, Fixed Purchase, Fixed Sales" Plans
    By March 28th, 109 counties in Shandong Province had conveyed the grain "Fixed Production, Fixed Purchase, Fixed Sales" policy to the townships. In the Wenden and Linyi districts, 2,505 townships had already conveyed the "Three Fixes" policy at township people's representative conferences and formulated plans for increased production this year. The remaining counties are also holding township people's representative conferences to convey the policy. In Henan Township, Junan County, seven agricultural production cooperatives and eleven mutual aid teams, based on their original plans, are preparing to irrigate an additional 520 mu of wheat, apply additional fertilizer to over 370 mu, convert 390 mu of single-season fields into double-season fields, and raise 94 more pigs. The Red Flag Agricultural Production Cooperative in Houpu Township, Jining County, has already weeded more than 270 mu of wheat, striving for a bountiful wheat harvest. The Jiangjia Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Guangrao County has recently found twelve more sources of fertilizer, which will increase fertilizer by 13 million jin for the whole year. In Fanjia Township, Qidong County, the sales volume of production materials such as farm tools and fertilizers by the supply and marketing cooperative increased more than thirty times in the ten days after the "Three Fixes" policy was conveyed.
    Nearly ten thousand townships in Jiangxi Province have already formulated or are in the process of formulating grain "Fixed Production, Fixed Purchase, Fixed Sales" plans. The CCP branches and township people's committees in more than 5,500 townships have determined the figures for the township's 1955 grain fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales. Currently, large numbers of Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, village cadres, and activists are, under the leadership of the CCP village branches, adopting various methods to publicize the "Three Fixes" policy to every farming household. Six work teams organized by the CCP Jiangxi Provincial Committee and the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee have been dispatched to Ji'an, Nanchang, Shangrao, Jiujiang, Fuzhou and other districts and the Gannan Administrative Region to assist in the work.

    山东大部地区已把粮食“三定”政策传达到乡
    江西近万个乡制定“定产、定购、定销”方案
    到三月二十八日，山东省已有一百零九个县把粮食“定产、定购、定销”政策传达到乡。文登、临沂两个专区已有二千五百零五个乡在乡人民代表大会会议上传达了“三定”政策，并制定了今年增产计划。其余各县也正召开乡人民代表大会会议进行传达。莒南县河南乡七个农业生产合作社和十一个互助组在原定计划的基础上，准备再多浇小麦五百二十亩，追肥三百七十多亩，单季田变双季田三百九十亩，增养毛猪九十四只。济宁县后铺乡的红旗农业生产合作社现已锄完小麦二百七十多亩，争取小麦丰收。广饶县姜家村农业生产合作社最近又找到了十二项肥源，全年能增加肥料一千三百万斤。齐东县范家乡的供销合作社在传达“三定”政策后的十天中，农具、肥料等生产资料的销售量比以前增加了三十多倍。
    江西省近万个乡已经或正在制定粮食“定产、定购、定销”方案。五千五百多个乡的中共支部和乡人民委员会已经确定了本乡一九五五年粮食定产、定购、定销的数字。目前，大批共产党员、青年团员、乡村干部和积极分子正在各中共乡村支部的领导下，采取各种方式把“三定”政策宣传到每个农户。中共江西省委和江西省人民委员会组织的六个工作团，已分赴吉安、南昌、上饶、九江、抚州等专区和赣南行政区协助工作。　（新华社）
