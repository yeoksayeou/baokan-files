General Zhang, Mr. Yang, Kalons of the local government, friends:

　　I feel very honored to be able to say a few words on the occasion of the signing of this protocol. Just as Mr. Yang rightly pointed out, this protocol illustrates the faithful implementation by both sides of the terms of the agreement reached between India and China on April 29, 1954. As everyone knows, the strong ties of friendship between our two countries have never been broken throughout thousands of years of history. The greatest significance of the Sino-Indian Agreement last year is that it embodies for the first time so concretely the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which in Indian are called the "Panchsheel," and this has been further affirmed by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India and Indian Prime Minister Nehru's return visit to China. It is gratifying that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence between China and India are increasingly becoming the basis for most countries to agree to peaceful coexistence. I am sure that the signing of this protocol today will further solidify the close friendship between us.

　　I may point out that today's ceremony illustrates that much work has been done by responsible officials on both sides in the most harmonious and friendly spirit. I am particularly pleased to see some of the officials in charge of the inventory work participating in this ceremony, because they bear the main part of the substantive work, and they deserve to be commended for successfully completing the tasks entrusted to them. At the same time, I would be remiss if I did not commend my friend Mr. Yang Gongsu for the patience, perseverance, and skill he demonstrated in our discussions in drafting and agreeing to today's protocol. I also cannot fail to thank the Lhasa Foreign Affairs Assistant Office of the People's Republic of China and all other personnel in the Gyangtse and Yatung branch offices who were involved in this work for their assistance and cooperation. With a view to friendship and further promoting the existing political, cultural, and commercial relations between our two countries, my colleagues present here and I are excited to see the conclusion of this ceremony.

    印度共和国驻拉萨总领事梅农的讲话张将军、杨先生、地方政府的噶伦们，朋友们：
    在此签定议定书之际，我能讲几句话的确感到非常光荣，正像杨先生正确地指出一样，这议定书说明了双方对于印、中两国在一九五四年四月二十九日所达成协定条款的忠实执行。大家晓得我们两国之间强有力的友谊纽带，在几千年的历史上始终没有断过。去年中印协定的最大意义表现在第一次这样具体地体现了和平共处的五项原则，这在印度文里叫做“五大原则”，这已被中国总理周恩来阁下的访问印度与印度总理尼赫鲁阁下的回访中国所更加肯定下来了。中印和平共处的五项原则，日益变成了并指导大多数国家同意和平共处的基础，这是令人满意的。我肯定的说今天此项议定书的签订会把我们之间的亲密友谊更进一步的凝结起来。
    我可以指出，今天的仪式说明了许多工作都是在双方的负责官员以最融洽和友好的精神进行的。我特别感到高兴的是能看到一部分办理清点工作的官员参加此项仪式，因为他们担负了实质工作的主力部分，同时由于他们顺利地完成了交与他们的任务，所以是值得表扬的。与此同时如果我不很好的赞扬一下我的朋友杨公素先生为起稿和同意今天签订的议定书时在我们所做的商谈中表现的耐心、毅力和技巧的谈话，那我就失职了。我也不能不答谢中华人民共和国政府拉萨外事帮办办事处和江孜亚东分处所有其他与这一工作有关的人员的帮助和合作作用。本着友好和进一步促进我们两国之间现有之政治文化和商业关系，我和我在场的同事们以兴奋的心情看到这仪式的结束。
