Solve Investment Problems According to the Principle of Benefiting Both Poor and Middle Peasants
    Gao Xiaoru

    In the autumn of 1954, the Dongxinzhuang village in Hunyuan County, Shanxi, expanded its original agricultural production cooperative from 39 households to 89 households. At the same time, a new cooperative of 34 households was established. The issues of land, draught animals, and farm tools joining the cooperatives were resolved relatively smoothly, but the problem of solving the production capital "got stuck." Many cooperative members were thinking about their own personal interests and were unwilling to invest in the cooperative.

    The two cooperatives needed members to invest in kind, such as seeds, feed, and fodder, as well as cash to buy cattle. How exactly should the investment be made? No one was sure. The cooperative committees decided vaguely that "those who have more should give more, those who have less should give less, and those who really have nothing should give nothing." However, this method didn't work. The new members didn't want to give anything. Some people said, "Yams and dry grass are so expensive now, it's better to sell them for cash!" Middle peasant Bai Changshun said, "If we're going to give, everyone should give. We can't just ask some people to give." Li Guoying said, "No one wants to give. Let's just rely on government loans." The old members also had their own plans. They were afraid that the yams and fodder of the new members would be priced at the market price, causing them to suffer losses. Because the yams and fodder that the cooperative uniformly deducted last autumn were priced at half the current price, they demanded a revaluation.

    The production capital problem was not resolved, and the cooperative committee members were very troubled and thought that they had no choice but to rely on the government. They ran to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) village branch secretary Zhao Cai and village chief Li Zhile for help. Zhao Cai and others analyzed the situation of the two cooperatives and believed that the reasons why the members were not actively investing were: there were contradictions between the poor and middle peasants; there were contradictions between the old and new members. Everyone only thought about their own personal interests and forgot about the collective interests; they only saw the immediate interests and did not see the long-term interests. The root cause was ideological. Therefore, it was decided to actively carry out ideological mobilization work from within the Party to outside the Party, implement the Party's class policy in the countryside, strengthen the socialist and collectivist education of the members, and overcome individualistic ideas. After this decision was made, the Party branch committee was convened first (with some Party members participating). During the discussion, everyone's opinions differed greatly. Deng Shilin said, "Every farmer keeps seeds. Seeds and fodder should rely on member investment, not government loans. Loans are not so convenient, and loans also require interest, which increases costs. As for whether everyone is willing to invest, it depends on how the regulations are made and how the price problem is handled. In my opinion, the best way to solve the price problem is to adopt the 'guaranteed principal and value' method (borrowing things and returning things). This is beneficial to both the middle and poor peasants." Meng Dianyuan disagreed with this opinion. He said, "This method won't work. What about years of poor harvest! This way, those who have nothing will benefit, and those who have something will suffer. Can this protect the interests of the middle peasants? It's better to mobilize members to invest universally, and the price can be lowered a bit." Deng Shilin retorted, "This is a one-sided middle peasant view. Universal investment is a practice that excludes the poor peasants. If the price is too high, exploitation will form within the cooperative, and the old members will not be satisfied; if the price is too low, no one will invest. The 'guaranteed principal and value' method is in line with the Party's policy." Their opinions were sharply opposed. Zhang Xiang wanted to come up with a compromise. He said, "It's better to make a price that is beneficial to both parties, otherwise the relationship between the poor and middle peasants will be bad." Zhang Shancai, the deputy secretary of the village branch, disagreed. He said, "Deng Shilin's opinion is right. 'Guaranteed principal and value' can protect the original items, and the members are used to it. Both new and old cooperatives can use it." Zhao Xiang stood up to object again, saying, "According to your opinion, it's good to price it at the market price! But have you considered whether this is in line with the Party's policy?" Party member Gao Lizhi questioned Zhao Xiang, saying, "According to your opinion, it's good to price it at the market price! But have you considered whether this is in line with the Party's policy?" Just as the two sides were at an impasse, village branch secretary Zhao Cai said, "Comrades, we are all Communist Party members. Why did we join the Party? It is to eliminate exploitation, overcome poverty, and lead all the peasants to live a common prosperous life. Deng Shilin and their opinions are correct. Running a cooperative must be done in accordance with the Party's policy. The prices of yams and fodder are currently abnormal. If they are priced at the market price, the poor peasants will suffer, which violates the Party's class policy. We also adopted the 'guaranteed principal and value' method last year. Who do you think benefited?" These words moved everyone. In the continuing discussion, Meng Dianyuan and others gradually realized the significance of implementing the class policy and reviewed their mistakes at the meeting. All agreed to implement the "guaranteed principal and value" method. Finally, it was decided to invest in kind and return the borrowed items, and to apportion according to the ratio of labor and land. Poor members could invest later or less, and extremely poor members could be exempted from investing.

    In order to overcome the phenomenon of discrimination against poor peasants within the Party and to strengthen the unity of poor and middle peasants, the branch committee decided to conduct an education on class policy for all Party members through the investment pricing issue. The next night, a branch general meeting was held (with Communist Youth League members attending). At the meeting, the Party's class policy was explained through the investment issue. After discussion, everyone's understanding was unified, and their confidence in mobilizing members to invest was also increased. They all believed that as long as all Party members took action and did their work well, even bigger problems could be solved. Party member Liu Bingyun immediately volunteered to invest one dou of naked oats and two hundred catties of yams. Then many Party members volunteered their investment amounts one after another. Everyone decided to go and mobilize other members to invest.

    On the basis of ideological unity within the Party, the two cooperatives immediately convened their cooperative committees together. At the meeting, in addition to studying the Party's class policy and implementing the resolutions of the Party branch, the egalitarianism of some cooperative cadres on the investment issue was criticized. Party member cadres with this thinking first reviewed their mistakes at the meeting. After repeated discussions, everyone finally agreed to adopt the method of apportioning labor and land in proportion and "guaranteed principal and value" for investment. Then they discussed the method of apportioning in proportion. Everyone felt that if the apportionment was based on the profit distribution ratio, the labor force would not be able to afford it, which would exclude the poor peasants; completely apportioning by land would also infringe on the interests of the middle peasants. Finally, it was decided to adopt the method of "land taking more, labor taking less." They believed that seeds, fertilizers, and fodder were also left according to the land when farming individually, so they should be allocated based on land; administrative management fees and miscellaneous expenses could be allocated based on labor. According to the ratio of these two aspects of expenditure, it was decided that 75% would be apportioned by land and 25% by labor. Land would apportion in kind, and labor would apportion in cash. Interest would be paid on the amount exceeding the apportionment standard according to the bank interest rate. Finally, it was discussed and determined which households could delay payment and which households could be exempted from payment.

    Since all Party members and cooperative cadres had clear and consistent policy viewpoints and specific methods to solve the problem, they then convened a members' meeting to implement the resolutions of the cooperative committee. When discussing the method of apportioning investment according to land and labor, everyone's opinions varied. Those with more labor advocated apportioning by land, and those with more land advocated apportioning by labor. Some even advocated that old cooperative members should apportion more labor and less land, and new cooperative members should apportion more land and less labor. After the patient persuasion of the cooperative cadres and Party members, everyone finally accepted the method determined by the cooperative committee. When discussing the issue of investment pricing, everyone's emotions were very tense, and the contradictions between the middle and poor peasants were clearly exposed. Middle peasant Shang Shou孝 first spoke. He said, "All investments should be priced at the current price, and the old cooperative's deductions last year should be revalued, so that no one will suffer. If we price it according to the old cooperative's price last year, who would sell grass and yams to invest!" Old cooperative member Zhao En agreed with his opinion, saying, "The yams and fodder of the old cooperative members are priced the same as those of the new cooperative members. This is 'mutual benefit,' which is in line with the policy." Poor peasant Shang Shouxin said, "Old Zhao, according to what you said, those who don't have seeds and dry grass will just work as hired laborers for nothing! They will never be able to pay off their debts, and those who have grass and seeds will just sit and eat." Poor peasant Xi Wu-ba proposed, "It's better to return what you borrow. Who would give you a price when you farm individually!" Middle peasant Han Ru advocated apportioning equally among households. At this time, Party member Deng Ren said, "No one will suffer from borrowing and returning things. Whoever has what they take what. Agricultural cooperatives cannot adopt the means of averaging and forcing. If the cooperative is not run well and the grain yield is low, it will not help to make small calculations. Look to the long term, look to the increase in agricultural cooperative production, and that's when no one will suffer. Let's just talk about the grass issue. If you use someone else's cattle to farm individually, you have to give them forty catties of dry grass for plowing one mu of land. No matter how expensive the fodder is, you have to plow the land. Sooner or later, it will be 'high tide floats all boats,' and you have to calculate from the land. The land has joined the cooperative, so everyone is planting it. You have to have cattle to plant the land. Cattle have to eat grass. The cattle belong to everyone, so everyone has to take care of them. If the price of grass is too high, what if you can't afford it?" These words played a great role. Middle peasant Sun Zhen's opinion was much more moderate. He said, "Not everyone has yams and fodder, so it's difficult to apportion equally. If everyone uses 'small minds,' the opinions will not be unified. We are 'more firewood makes a bigger flame,' so it's better to discuss it." The fierce debate eased down. The cooperative cadres seized this opportunity to explain the benefits of "guaranteed principal and value" to everyone; and pointed out why it was unreasonable to price it at the current market price. He said, "Fodder feeds everyone's cattle, and the cattle plow the land for everyone; the cattle eat grass, and the cattle will also earn grass. This is a general principle. If you want to live a good life, you have to plan for the collective cause. The method of 'borrowing things and returning things' is simple and easy to handle, and it is in line with the principle of mutual benefit. Everyone should think about it carefully." After this, some middle peasant members realized the unity of collective interests and their own interests. Middle peasant Shang Shou孝 said:
  "Anyway, everyone's heart is standing tall. If everyone's thinking is consistent, then it is reasonable to invest what you have. Let's not argue, we will know when we compare it with individual farming." Middle peasant Xiong Xikong also said, "If we invest equally among households and price it at the market price, the poor peasants will suffer! They won't get any grain in the autumn, what will they eat in the winter!" So the investment problem was solved according to the "guaranteed principal and value" method. At the meeting, everyone scrambled to report the amount of investment according to the apportionment standard. Li Bao and Deng Shizhen, who were originally estimated to be unable to invest, also reported two dou of naked oats.

    However, some middle peasant households were still hesitating and waiting, afraid of revealing their wealth, and did not speak. After the Party branch committee members discovered this problem, they proposed to adjourn the meeting. After the meeting, individual mobilization was carried out, and finally the investment problem was completely solved. Because the members were educated on the class policy when mobilizing investment, the two cooperatives in Dongxinzhuang not only solved the investment problem, but also improved the socialist consciousness of the members, and a new atmosphere of unity between the middle and poor peasants in production emerged. Currently, the members are busy with spring plowing and production.

      Editor's note: Recently, many agricultural cooperatives in various places have experienced the situation where members are unwilling to invest; the basic spirit of solving the problem of member investment by relying on the poor peasants and uniting the middle peasants in the two agricultural cooperatives in Dongxinzhuang reported in this newsletter is very good, and can be used as a reference for agricultural cooperatives in various places when solving this problem. However, the specific methods of investment adopted by these two agricultural cooperatives should still be improved.

    按照贫农中农两利的原则解决投资问题
    高效儒
    一九五四年秋后，山西浑源县东辛庄把原有的一个农业生产合作社由三十九户扩大到了八十九户，同时又建立了一个三十四户的新社。这两个社的土地、耕畜、农具入社问题都解决得比较顺利，但在解决生产垫本的问题上就“卡住了”，许多社员都在个人利益上打算盘，不愿向社里投资。
    两社需要社员投资的有种籽、饲料、饲草等实物，还有购买耕牛的现金。究竟怎样投法？大家心里都没底。社务委员会就笼统地决定“有的多拿，没的少拿，实在没有的不拿”。可是这个办法执行不通。新社员都不想拿。有的人说：“山药、干草，现在价钱这么贵，不如卖两个现成钱哩！”中农白长顺说：“要拿大家都拿，不能单叫一些人拿。”李国英说：“谁也不想拿，咱们干脆靠政府贷款吧。”老社员也有老社员的打算，他们怕新社员的山药、草料按市价作价，使自己吃亏。因为去年秋天社里统一扣除的山药和饲草作的价比现在的价钱差一半多，所以他们要求重新作价。
    生产垫本问题得不到解决，社务委员们挺为难，也认为只好依靠政府来解决了。他们跑去找中共乡支部书记赵才、乡长李志乐，请求帮助。赵才等分析研究了两个社的情况，认为社员不积极投资的原因是：贫农中农之间有矛盾；新老社员之间有矛盾。大家都只想到个人利益，忘记了集体利益；只看见眼前利益，看不见长远利益。归根到底是思想问题。因此，决定由党内到党外积极进行思想发动工作，贯彻党在农村的阶级政策，加强对社员的社会主义教育和集体主义教育，克服个人主义思想。这样决定后，就首先召开了党支部委员会（吸收部分党员参加）。讨论中，大家的意见分歧很大。邓士林说：“庄稼人家谁也留籽种；籽种、饲草要依靠社员投资，不能依靠政府贷款。贷款也没有那么方便，况且贷款还要上利，出了利息就加大了成本。至于大家愿不愿意投资，就要看规定怎样投法，怎样处理价格问题。依我看，解决价格问题，最好采取‘保本保值’（借物还物的办法。这样对中农贫农双方有利。”孟殿元不同意这个意见，他说：“这个办法使不上，歉收年怎办！这样没东西的占便宜，有东西的吃亏，这能维护中农的利益吗？还是发动社员普遍投资好，价钱降低些就行了。”邓士林反驳说：“你这是片面的中农观点，普遍投资是排斥贫农的做法。作价高了社内就会形成剥削，而且老社员也不满意；作价低了谁也不投。还是‘保本保值’的办法符合党的政策。”他两人的意见针锋相对。张祥想来个折中办法，他说：“还是作个对双方有利的价钱好，不然贫农中农的关系闹不好。”乡支部副书记张善才不同意，他说：“还是邓士林的意见对，‘保本保值’能保住原物，社员也有这个习惯，新老社都可以采用。”赵祥又起来反对说：“有的新社员把草早卖了；人家老社员卖了草也会投钱。”党员高利质问赵祥说：“照你的意见，按市价作价好！可是你考虑这样符合党的政策吗？”正在双方意见相持不下的时候，乡支部书记赵才说：“同志们，我们都是共产党员。入党是为什么呢？是为了消灭剥削，战胜贫困，带领全体农民过共同富裕的生活。邓士林他们的意见提的对，办社得按党的政策办事。目前山药、饲草的价格不正常，如按市价作，贫农就要吃亏，那就违背了党的阶级政策。我们去年也采取‘保本保值’的办法，你们说到底谁沾了谁的光呢？”这一番话打动了大家。在继续讨论中，孟殿元等逐步认识了贯彻阶级政策的意义，并且在会上检讨了自己的错误，都同意实行
  “保本保值”的办法。最后，决定以实物投资、借物还物为主，按劳力土地比例分摊，超过分摊标准的给利息。贫苦社员可以缓投或少投，极贫苦的可以免投。
    为了克服党内歧视贫农现象和加强贫农中农的团结，支部委员会决定要通过投资作价问题，对全体党员进行一次阶级政策的教育。第二天晚上召开了支部大会（团员列席）。会上通过投资问题解释了党的阶级政策。经过讨论，大家的认识一致了，发动社员投资的信心也提高了，都认为只要全体党员行动起来，做好工作，问题再大些也能解决。党员刘炳云当即自报投资一斗莜麦，二百斤山药。接着许多党员都相继自报了投资数目。大家又决定分头去发动别的社员投资。
    在党内思想一致的基础上，紧接着两社就一起召开了社务委员会。会上除研究了党的阶级政策和贯彻了党支部的决议以外，还针对某些社干部在投资问题上的平均主义思想进行了批判。有这种思想的党员干部在会上首先进行了检讨。经过反复讨论，大家最后同意采用劳力、土地按比例分摊和
  “保本保值”的办法投资。接着又讨论按比例分摊的办法。大家觉得如果按分益比例分摊，劳力拿不起，就会排斥了贫农；完全按地摊也会侵犯中农利益。最后决定采用“土地多拿，劳力少拿”的办法。他们认为：籽种、肥料、饲草单干也是按地留，应该从地走；行政管理费和杂项费用可以从劳力走。根据这两方面的支出比例，决定地摊百分之七十五，劳力摊百分之二十五。地分摊实物，劳力分摊现金。超过分摊标准的按银行利率付息。最后又讨论确定了哪些户可以缓交，哪些户可以免交。
    全体党员和社务干部既然有了明确一致的政策观点，又有了解决问题的具体办法，接着就召开社员大会来贯彻社委会的决议。在讨论按土地、劳力分摊投资办法时，大家意见纷纷。劳力多的主张按地摊，地多的主张按劳力摊。有的还主张老社劳力多摊，地少摊，新社地多摊，劳力少摊。经过社干部和党员的耐心说服，最后大家接受了社委会确定的办法。在讨论到投资作价问题时，大家情绪又很紧张，又明显地暴露了中农贫农之间的矛盾。中农尚守孝首先发言，他说：“全部投资一律按现在的价格作，老社去年扣下的重新作价，谁也不吃亏。如按老社去年的价钱作，谁也卖了草和山药投钱呀！”老社员赵恩同意他的意见说：“老社员的山药和饲草跟新社员的一样作价，这就是‘互利’，正符合政策。”贫农尚守信说：“老赵，按你说，没有种籽、干草的人就白扛长工吧，一辈子也还不清饥荒了，有草和种籽的就坐着吃罢。”贫农席五八提出：“还是借啥还啥好。单干种地谁给你作价哩！”中农韩儒主张按户平均分摊。这时党员邓仁说：“借物还物谁也不吃亏，谁有啥就拿啥。农业社不能采取平均硬逼的手段。社搞不好打的粮食少，再打小算盘也不顶事。往远看吧，看农业社增产吧，这才是个谁也不吃亏。咱就从草的问题上说吧，单干种地用人家的牛，耕一亩地得给人家出四十斤干草。饲草再贵也得耕地。几时也是‘水涨船高’，也得从地里计算计算。土地入了社，就是大家种。种地得有牛。牛就要吃草。牛是大家的，得大家爱护。草作价高了打不起怎办？”这番话起了很大作用。中农孙珍的意见缓和多了，他说：“山药、草料不是谁都有，均摊有困难。如果都使‘小心眼’，意见就不统一。咱们是‘大家拾柴火焰高’，还是商量着办好。”激烈的争论缓和下来了。社干部抓住这个时机向大家说明“保本保值”的好处；并指出按现在市价作价为什么不合理。他说：“饲草喂大家的牛，牛给大家耕地；牛吃草，牛还会挣草。这是一般的道理。要想过好光景，就得为集体事业打算。‘借物还物’的办法是简便好办，又合乎互利原则。大家要好好考虑考虑。”经这一说，某些中农社员认识了集体利益和自己利益的一致性。中农尚守孝说：
  “反正谁的心也是立长着，大家思想一致了，有啥垫啥，就是合理。咱们大家谁也不要争论，拿单干一比就知道了。”中农熊希孔也说：“如果按户平均投资按市价作价，贫农就够受啦！秋天分不上粮，冬天吃啥呀！”于是就按照“保本保值”的办法解决了投资问题。在会上大家都照着分摊标准争着报投资数目。原来估计投不了资的李保和邓士珍，也报了二斗莜麦。
    可是有些中农户还在犹豫、等待，怕露富，不发言。党支部委员们发觉这个问题后，就提议散会。会后又进行了个别动员，最后才把投资问题完全解决了。因为在发动投资时对社员进行了阶级政策的教育，东辛庄两社不仅解决了投资问题，而且提高了社员的社会主义觉悟，出现了中农贫农团结生产的新气象。目前社员正在紧张地进行春耕生产。
      编者按：最近各地不少农业合作社发生了社员不愿投资的情况；这篇通讯中报道的东辛庄两个农业合作社按照依靠贫农、团结中农的阶级政策解决社员投资问题的基本精神是很好的，可供各地农业合作社在解决这个问题时参考。但是，这两个农业合作社所采取的投资的具体办法还是应当再加改进的。
