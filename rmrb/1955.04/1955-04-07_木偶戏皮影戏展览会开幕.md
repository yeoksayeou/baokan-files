    Puppet and Shadow Play Exhibition Opens
    The puppet and shadow play exhibition opened on April 5th at the Beijing Fine Arts Exhibition Hall.
    The exhibition is jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Artists Association, and the Chinese Dramatists Association, with the aim of exploring, researching, and organizing the artistic heritage of folk puppet shows and shadow plays. Participating units include Fujian, Guangdong, Shanxi, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Hebei, Zhejiang, Heilongjiang, Shandong provinces, and Shanghai.
    The exhibited written reference materials state that records of puppet shows in China date back to the Tang Dynasty. The exhibition includes more than 110 puppets, including string puppets manipulated by strings, rod puppets manipulated by bamboo rods, glove puppets manipulated by fingers, and iron support puppets manipulated by wires. The largest, such as the large puppets from Sichuan Province, are four chi (approximately 4 feet) tall. These are the surviving works of Yang Dai, a famous carver from the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty. The smallest, such as the glove puppets from Fujian, are only about one chi (approximately 1 foot) tall. The puppet heads carved by Jiang Jiazou (deceased), a famous artist from Fujian Province, which are on display, have dozens of different styles and expressions. In particular, Jiang Jiazou's precious surviving works, such as the complete set of characters from "Farewell My Concubine," "The Butterfly Lovers," "The Legend of the White Snake," and "San岔口 (Three Forks)," have attracted much attention from the audience. Some of the puppets on display that depict modern life and characters are particularly endearing. It is understood that in 1929, puppet artists in Fujian Province cooperated with the people's revolutionary struggle at the time to perform plays reflecting real life, such as "Fighting Local Tyrants," "Freedom of Marriage," and "Illiteracy." After the national liberation, more puppet artists have paid attention to performing modern dramas, and puppet troupes in many places have performed plays such as "New Children's Heroes" and "The White-Haired Girl."
    Among the shadow play exhibits, the hundreds of shadow play figures and scenery collected by the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee Culture Bureau are exquisitely carved and brightly colored. The figures in this part of the work include ancient warriors and modern rural women wearing headscarves. In the scenery and patterns, there is a piece that carves hundreds of bee colonies, each about one centimeter long, on a piece of cowhide three chi (approximately 3 feet) long and one chi (approximately 1 foot) wide, which are meticulously and vividly carved. Among the shadow play exhibits, there are also treasures from Shandong Province with a history of more than 300 years. Hunan's "Crane and Turtle" has increased the three-dimensionality of birds and animals, which previously appeared flat in shadow puppets, by changing the traditional carving methods.

    木偶戏皮影戏展览会开幕
    木偶戏、皮影戏展览会四月五日在北京美术展览馆里开幕。
    展览会是由中华人民共和国文化部、中国美术家协会、中国戏剧家协会联合举办的，目的是为了发掘、研究和整理民间木偶戏、皮影戏的艺术遗产。参加展览的有福建、广东、山西、青海、陕西、湖南、四川、河北、浙江、黑龙江、山东省和上海市等单位。
    展出的文字参考材料说明：我国从唐代开始就有关于木偶戏的记载了。这次展出的木偶共一百一十多件，其中有用线操纵的提线木偶、用竹杖操纵的杖头木偶、用手指操纵的布袋木偶和用铁丝操纵的铁支木偶。最大的如四川省的大木偶身长有四市尺，这是清代道光年间名雕刻手杨代的遗作；最小的如福建的布袋木偶身长不过一尺左右。这次展出的福建省名艺人江加走（已故）雕刻的木偶人头有几十种不同的样式和表情，特别是江加走的珍贵遗作，如“霸王别姬”、“梁山伯与祝英台”、“白蛇传”、“三岔口”等剧的全套人物，很受观众注意。展品中的一部分表现现代生活和人物的木偶特别使人们感到亲切。据了解，在一九二九年时，福建省的木偶艺人就曾配合当时的人民革命斗争演出过“打土豪”、“婚姻自由”、“不识字”等反映现实生活的剧目。全国解放以后，更多的木偶艺人重视演现代剧，不少地方的木偶剧团演出过“新儿女英雄传”、“白毛女”等剧目。
    皮影戏的展品中，上海市人民委员会文化局收集的几百件皮影人物和布景刻得非常精致，彩色也很鲜艳。这部分作品中的人物有古代武士，也有包着头巾的现代乡村妇女；布景和图案中有一幅是在一块长三市尺宽一市尺的牛皮上刻出几百个身长一厘米左右的蜂群，刻绘得精细、生动。在皮影的展品中还有山东省的已有三百多年历史的珍品。湖南的“鹤与龟”由于改变了传统的雕刻方法，使过去皮影中看来只是扁平的鸟兽等增加了立体感。
