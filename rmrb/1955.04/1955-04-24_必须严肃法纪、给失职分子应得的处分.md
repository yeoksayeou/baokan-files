    Editor's Note: In the "Reader's Letters" column of this newspaper on January 2 this year, the article "Food Company Should Immediately Improve Livestock Breeding Work" criticized the large-scale deaths of livestock at the Pingdiquan Branch of the China Food Company. Later, this newspaper forwarded the critical letter from comrades like Yi Bo to the Pingdiquan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for investigation and handling. The Pingdiquan Prefectural Committee instructed the Party Group of the Pingdiquan Special District Finance Committee to organize relevant units to form a joint inspection team to conduct a thorough inspection of the work of the Pingdiquan Branch of the China Food Company and punished the derelict elements. On March 13 this year, after this newspaper published readers' criticisms of Shi Baoyi, an employee of the Chuxian Oil and Fat Company in Anhui, for wasting sesame seeds, the Chuxian Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Anhui immediately instructed relevant units to investigate and handle the matter. We believe that the serious attitude of the Pingdiquan Prefectural Committee and the Chuxian Prefectural Committee towards criticism is good. Their letters are published below:
    Zhang Chaoyuan Receives Party Disciplinary Action
    Comrade Editor:
    Recently, relevant units in the Pingdiquan Administrative District of Inner Mongolia conducted a three-month investigation into the work of the Pingdiquan Branch of the China Food Company based on reports from the masses. It has been proven that the confusion in the business management of the Pingdiquan Branch and the bureaucratic work style of its leaders are very serious. In the ten months from March to December 1954, this company lost 3,659 cattle, 6,648 sheep, and 1,240 pigs, worth 331,248 yuan. Losses due to spoilage of major non-staple foods amounted to 10,667 yuan, and losses due to reduced prices and increased expenses amounted to 223,141 yuan. The total loss was 565,056 yuan. In addition, the losses caused by the above losses, such as livestock losing weight, taxes, and bank interest, totaled 1,800,6622 yuan. Thus, in ten months, the state lost a total of 2,371,678 yuan.
    The main reason for this significant loss was that Zhang Chaoyuan, the acting manager of the Pingdiquan Branch, was derelict of duty, arrogant and complacent, and did not listen to the opinions of the masses. He adopted an irresponsible bureaucratic attitude towards state property. In the procurement work, he blindly pursued quantity and neglected quality. After a large number of livestock were concentrated, he did not pay attention to good feeding and management. He spent all day dealing with official documents, did not go into practice, did not adopt rationalization proposals, did not plan his work, and rarely supervised or inspected. Many comrades raised objections to this phenomenon, and Soviet experts also made friendly criticisms of Zhang Chaoyuan's erroneous attitude of not cherishing state property, and made many valuable suggestions on poor livestock feeding and storage and inadequate equipment. However, these criticisms and suggestions did not attract Zhang Chaoyuan's attention. More seriously, Zhang Chaoyuan adopted a repressive attitude towards those who made rationalization proposals for cherishing state property. After Comrade Cheng Zisi of the Storage Section put forward rationalization proposals on strengthening the responsibility system and improving work procedures, Zhang Chaoyuan not only did not humbly consider them, but instead attacked him. He used the pretext of eliminating Comrade Cheng Zisi's bourgeois ideology and held meetings for four consecutive nights to criticize Cheng Zisi, and finally made Cheng Zisi write a written review.
    Zhang Chaoyuan's mistakes are very serious. His bureaucratic work style not only caused losses to state property, but also had a very bad impact on the masses. In order to educate him, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Pingdiquan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to give Zhang Chaoyuan a two-year probationary period within the Party and recommended that he be dismissed from his administrative position and sent to the court for legal punishment.

    Shi Baoyi Sentenced to Imprisonment
    The Chuxian Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Anhui wrote: After seeing the article "Wasteful Behavior 'Approved'" published in the People's Daily on March 13, we immediately instructed the leaders of the Chuxian Oil and Fat Branch to conduct an inspection and sent personnel from the Prefectural Procuratorate Branch and the Supervision Office to investigate and handle the matter. Facts have proved that the readers' criticisms are completely correct.
    In December 1954, the Chuxian Oil and Fat Branch set up a temporary transshipment group in Pukou to transfer export sesame seeds, and sent Shi Baoyi, a clerk from the technology section, to be specifically responsible. At that time, in addition to processing and sorting sesame seeds transferred from various counties for export, the remaining muddy sesame seeds, 93 bags in total, were stored in the Nanjing Port Authority warehouse. In January of this year, the Nanjing Port Authority wanted to take back the warehouse, so Shi Baoyi went back to the company to ask Section Chief Chen Ming and Deputy Manager Xu Bangqian, and asked, "There are a few sesame seeds in the mud that cannot be screened out, how should we deal with it?" Xu Bangqian believed that the company was very busy and could not send responsible cadres to take care of this matter, so he sent bookkeeper Gao Jiawang. When Gao Jiawang arrived in Pukou, Shi Baoyi repeatedly said, "There are basically no sesame seeds in the mud," "Each bag only has four or five catties, and it is not enough to pay for processing." Gao Jiawang irresponsibly agreed to discard these "mud" after which he rushed to Nanjing to watch Beijing opera and visit relatives. When Shi Baoyi asked workers to dump these muddy sesame seeds into the river, workers Shi Baoshan, Tang Chongen, and others offered to sort out the muddy sesame seeds and transport them back to Chuxian or convert them into wages for the workers, but Shi Baoyi did not accept. He ordered the workers to dump 49 bags of muddy sesame seeds into the Yangtze River.
    This incident is very serious. This has not only caused great losses to the wealth of the country, but also had a very bad impact on the masses. According to the calculation of the 44 bags of muddy sesame seeds that were later transported back to Chuxian for processing, a total of 1,485 catties of sesame seeds were screened out, an average of 33 catties and 12 taels per bag, plus another 910 catties of shriveled sesame seeds. If calculated according to this number, the 49 bags of sesame seeds dumped into the river could have screened out 1,653 catties of sesame seeds and about 1,013 catties of shriveled sesame seeds, which, according to the listed price, would have resulted in a total loss of 349 yuan in Renminbi. The oil extracted from these sesame seeds, if calculated according to the rural supply of four taels of oil per person per month, could feed 100 people for 29 months.
    Shi Baoyi's behavior of seriously harming the interests of the state is intolerable. In order to educate Shi Baoyi and the vast number of cadres to cherish state property and prevent phenomena that harm public interests, the Chuxian Local Intermediate People's Court of Anhui Province has held a public trial and sentenced Shi Baoyi to one and a half years in prison. In addition, this incident is inseparable from the bureaucratic work style of the leadership of the Chuxian Branch of the China Oil and Fat Company. Deputy Manager Xu Bangqian has made a written review, and Gao Jiawang has been dismissed. We will notify all agencies in the Chuxian Special District of this incident to educate cadres and strengthen the concept of cherishing state property.

### 必须严肃法纪、给失职分子应得的处分

    必须严肃法纪、给失职分子应得的处分
    编者按：今年一月二日本报“读者来信专页”上发表的“食品公司应立即改进牲畜饲养工作”一文中，对中国食品公司平地泉分公司牲畜大量死亡的现象提出了批评。后来本报又将读者一波等同志的批评信转中共平地泉地委会检查处理。平地泉地委责成平地泉专区财委会党组组织有关单位成立联合检查组，对中国食品公司平地泉分公司的工作进行了彻底的检查，并且惩处了失职分子。今年三月十三日，本报发表了读者对安徽滁县油脂公司史宝义浪费芝麻的批评以后，中共安徽滁县地委即责成有关单位调查处理。我们认为平地泉地委会和滁县地委会这种对待批评的严肃态度是好的。现在把他们的来信发表在下面：
    张朝元受到党纪处分
    编辑同志：
    最近，内蒙古平地泉行政区的有关单位根据群众的揭发，对中国食品公司平地泉分公司的工作进行了三个多月的检查。证明平地泉分公司经营管理工作的混乱和领导上的官僚主义作风是十分严重的。这个公司在一九五四年三月到十二月的十个月中，就死亡牛三千六百五十九头，羊六千六百四十八只，猪一千二百四十头，价值三十三万一千二百四十八元。主要副食品腐烂损失一万零六百六十七元，商品削价增大费用损耗等损失二十二万三千一百四十一元。共损失五十六万五千零五十六元。此外，因为以上损失所引起的牲畜掉膘、税收、银行利息等损失共一百八十万零六千六百二十二元。这样，在十个月中共使国家损失了二百三十七万一千六百七十八元。
    造成这种重大损失的原因，主要是平地泉分公司代经理张朝元在工作中玩忽职守，骄傲自满，不听取群众意见，对国家财产采取了不负责任的官僚主义态度。在收购工作上，他盲目地追求数量，忽视质量。大批牲畜集中以后，又没有注意很好的饲养管理。他整天忙于处理公文事务，不深入实际，不采纳合理化建议，工作没有计划，也很少进行督促、检查。许多同志对于这种现象提出了意见，苏联专家对张朝元这种不爱护国家财产的错误态度也提出了友谊的批评，并且对牲畜饲养保管不善和设备不良等问题提出了许多宝贵的建议，但是，这些批评和建议却没有引起张朝元的重视。更严重的是张朝元对于爱护国家财产提出合理化建议的人采取压制的态度。储畜科程子泗同志提出关于加强责任制度，改进工作手续的合理化建议以后，张朝元不但不虚心考虑，反而进行打击；他借口肃清程子泗同志的资产阶级思想，连续用四个晚上开会对程子泗进行批评，最后让程子泗作了书面检讨。
    张朝元的错误是十分严重的。他的官僚主义作风不仅使国家财产遭受了损失，在群众中也造成了很不好的影响。为了对他进行教育，中共平地泉地委纪律检查委员会已决定给张朝元以留党察看两年的处分，并建议行政上撤销他的工作，送交法院依法惩办。
        中共平地泉地委纪律检查委员会　王步成
    史宝义被判处徒刑
    中共安徽滁县地委会来信：看到三月十三日人民日报发表的“经过‘批准’的浪费行为”一文后，我们立即责成滁县油脂分公司领导上进行检查，并由专署检察分院和监察处派人前往调查处理。事实证明，读者的批评是完全正确的。
    一九五四年十二月，滁县油脂分公司在浦口设临时转运组调运出口芝麻，派组技科办事员史宝义具体负责。当时，接收各县调来的芝麻除加工整理出口外，剩余泥土芝麻九十三包存放在南京港务局仓库。今年一月里，南京港务局要收回仓库，史宝义就回公司请示陈明科长和徐邦前副经理，提出“泥土里有少数芝麻无法筛下，如何处理”，徐邦前认为公司里工作很忙，不能派负责干部过问这件事，就派记账员高家旺去了。高家旺到了浦口，史宝义就一再说“泥土里基本上没有什么芝麻了”“每包只有四、五斤，加工不够工资”。高家旺不负责任地同意把这些“泥土”作废以后，就匆匆地赶到南京看京戏和探亲去了。在史宝义让工人把这些泥土芝麻倒入江里的时候，工人施保山、唐崇恩等曾提出愿意代为整理泥土芝麻运回滁县或折合成工资分给工人，但史宝义没有接受。他指挥工人把四十九包泥土芝麻倒在长江里了。
    这一事件是十分严重的。这不仅给国家财富造成了很大的损失，而且在群众中产生了极不好的影响。根据后来运回滁县加工的四十四包泥土芝麻筛净计算，共筛出芝麻一千四百八十五斤，平均每包三十三斤十二两，另外还有瘪芝麻九百一十斤。如果按照这个数推算，倒入江内的四十九包芝麻可筛出芝麻一千六百五十三斤，瘪芝麻一千零十三斤左右，按牌价折算共损失人民币三百四十九元。这些芝麻所榨出的油，如按农村每人每月四两油的供应量计算，可供一百人吃二十九个月。
    史宝义这种严重损害国家利益的行为，是不能容忍的。为了教育史宝义和广大干部爱护国家的财产，防止损害公共利益的现象，安徽省滁县地方中级人民法院已经举行公审，判处史宝义一年半的徒刑。此外，这一事件是和中国油脂公司滁县分公司领导方面的官僚主义作风分不开的，徐邦前副经理已作了书面检讨，高家旺受到撤职处分。我们将把这一事件通报滁县专区各地机关，以教育干部，加强爱护国家财产的观念。
