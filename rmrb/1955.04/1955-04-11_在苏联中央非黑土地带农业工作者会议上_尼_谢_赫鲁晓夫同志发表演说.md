At the Meeting of Agricultural Workers in the Central Non-Black Soil Zone of the Soviet Union
N.S. Khrushchev Delivers Speech
    The meeting of agricultural workers from the states and autonomous republics of the Central Non-Black Soil Zone of the Soviet Union concluded on the 7th at the Kremlin. As in the past two days, the closing meeting continued to discuss the report by Comrade P. Lobanov, Vice-Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers.
    Comrade N.S. Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, delivered a long speech at the meeting, which was warmly welcomed by the participants.
    Comrade N.S. Khrushchev said: Many outstanding people have spoken from this rostrum. They said that the collective farms and state farms in the Central Non-Black Soil Zone have great potential to increase the production of grains, potatoes, flax, vegetables, as well as milk, meat, and other livestock products. We have all listened very carefully to the speeches of Comrade Zhilonova from Smolensk Oblast, Comrade Nilova from Kalinin Oblast, Comrade Arepiev from Moscow Oblast, Comrade Yefremova from Lison Oblast, Comrade Yanichkina, a member of the Communist Youth League from Ivanovo Oblast, Comrade Sherbinna, an advanced agricultural worker from Ukraine, a guest of this meeting, Comrade Saukh, and many others. There are tens of thousands of people in our country like them who are skilled in agriculture and animal husbandry. We have many good collective farms and state farms, as well as good districts as a whole. Their experiences should be vigorously publicized and applied to production.
    Some states have achieved results, and the leaders of these states correctly understood the resolutions of the plenary session of the Party Central Committee and conducted practical organizational work in collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms. The situation in Lison Oblast can be taken as an example. Last year, the milk yield per cow in the collective farms of this oblast increased by 412 kilograms. This year, the indicators of this oblast are higher than those of other states in the non-black soil zone. I think the Party Committee of Lison Oblast is correct, and Comrade Larionov, the secretary of the Oblast Committee, is working enthusiastically.
    However, today I am mainly not talking about achievements, but I want to raise some critical opinions about the leaders of some states and autonomous republics in the Central Non-Black Soil Zone.
    As you all know, the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party has put forward the task of ensuring a harvest of at least 10 billion poods of grain annually. This is a very arduous and responsible task. This task should constantly motivate each of us and call on all the Soviet people to move forward. Striving to achieve this task is the main and decisive task in all our work to improve agriculture. Whoever forgets this task, deviates from this task, and only limits himself to empty talk is drowning this very important cause in nonsense.
    How can we increase grain production to 10 billion poods? The resolution of the January Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party provides a detailed answer to this question. The strength of the resolution of the January Plenary Session of the Central Committee lies in: it points out the ways to solve this national task, points out the specific sources to ensure increased grain production, which are: improving the yield per unit area of all cultivated land, reducing losses during harvest, reclaiming virgin and fallow land, and greatly expanding the planting area of ​​corn.
    Comrade Khrushchev continued, it is impossible to solve this task without changing agricultural planning work. If the chairman of the collective farm is deprived of the right to plan the economy according to the specific conditions of the farm, then it is difficult to do anything. When the chairman of the collective farm is ordered to sow barley, he has to carry out this order and sow it, even though he knows that he can only harvest five quintals of barley per hectare, even though he knows that planting this crop is not economically cost-effective. Under this method of formulating plans, the plan itself creates the inability to harvest a bumper crop of grain. Of course, the chairman of the collective farm can strive to obtain the maximum yield of this crop, but this cannot enable the collective farm to drastically increase its grain harvest. However, under the same conditions, if higher-yielding crops are used to replace lower-yielding crops, then the collective farm can obtain several times more grain.
    The January Plenary Session of the Central Committee believes that it is necessary to change the planning work. The Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet Council of Ministers adopted a special resolution on the new planning system in March. But can it be said that all localities correctly understand the significance of this resolution? Comrade Khrushchev said, not yet. Many states and districts continue to adhere to the old planning system and have not exploited all potential to greatly increase crop production this year. These are the facts that the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party has grasped in this regard.
    The Stalin Collective Farm in Susaninsky District is one of the advanced collective farms in Kostroma Oblast. It has every possibility to complete the minimum output of agricultural products per hundred hectares of land stipulated by the January Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party before 1960. However, the measures of this collective farm published by the "Northern Truth" of Kostroma Oblast on March 8 stipulate that the production of the collective farm will reach the above-mentioned level in 1960. Moreover, the production of important items such as grain, meat, milk, eggs, and wool is only planned until 1960, and the total output of these products in 1955 and the following years is not specified.
    N.S. Khrushchev emphasized that if the plan of an advanced collective farm is like this, then how can it serve as an example for medium and backward collective farms? Since the newspaper published such news, it should be considered that leading workers of the state organization also participated in the formulation of this plan. Therefore, they did not correctly understand the new planning system. If the secretaries of the state and district party committees could personally visit the collective farms, discuss with the collective farm members, solicit their opinions, and talk with them, then the plans formulated in this way would be useful for other collective farms to learn from the experience of advanced collective farms. However, the leaders of Kostroma Oblast apparently have not yet truly understood the resolution on the new planning system and have not helped the collective farms to correctly carry out this important work.
    And this is not an isolated example. The Bryansk Oblast Party Committee and the Oblast Executive Committee not only did not specifically help the collective farms formulate plans, but instead used high-handed bureaucratic methods to do this. On March 18, Comrade Peterkhov, secretary of the Oblast Party Committee, and Comrade Dadonov, chairman of the Oblast Executive Committee, sent a document to each district, requiring each district to complete the work of formulating various measures to implement the resolution of the January Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party before March 25. Such a strict instruction was issued on March 18, and all collective farms were required to submit their plans before March 25! But everyone knows that within such a time limit, many collective farms would not even receive this instruction. Comrades, why are you deceiving yourselves? Attached to the instructions issued to each district was also an indicator table, requiring each collective farm to formulate measures based on these indicators. This indicator table was as long as ten pages and had about two thousand indicators. The secretary of the Oblast Party Committee and the chairman of the Oblast Executive Committee may not have read these indicators when they signed this instruction. If they had taken a careful look, perhaps they would not have issued such a bureaucratic document.
    Comrade Khrushchev cited an example from the actual work in Kirov Oblast. There, serious mistakes were made in formulating measures to increase grain and livestock production. The measures in Vyatskopolyany District stipulated that a total of 20,000 tons of grain would be harvested in 1955, but the collective farms in this district had already harvested 21,000 tons of grain in 1953. Moreover, this plan was formulated after the Central Committee's January Plenary Session made a decision!

    Look at how some comrades understand these resolutions that require a large increase in grain production. The measures in Buysk District, Bogorodsk District, Lebeg District, and Rozhkin District also do not stipulate an increase in grain production. The ten districts of Kirov Oblast only plan to slightly increase the planting area of corn in 1955 and the following years. And it is only planned to use corn to make silage feed.
    There are similar examples in Tula Oblast. The "Commune Member Newspaper" of Tula Oblast published a plan for 1955-1960 on March 15 for an advanced collective farm—the "11th Anniversary of the October Revolution" collective farm in Yefremov District. This plan stipulates that the output of meat, milk, eggs, and other products per hundred hectares of land by 1960 is much less than that stipulated in the resolution of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. However, the newspaper promoted this incorrect plan as a model plan!
    The "Gorky Truth" and other state-level newspapers have also published such so-called plans.
    The conditions for developing agriculture in Gorky Oblast and Tula Oblast are very favorable, but they are not being utilized well. The collective farms and state farms in these two states produce too little milk, meat, and other livestock products, and are seriously lagging behind in the development of grain, potato, and vegetable production. For example, the milk yield per cow in Gorky Oblast last year was 1,075 kilograms, and in Tula Oblast it was 1,165 kilograms. The yield of potatoes and vegetables is very low. These facts make people feel seriously uneasy about the leadership of the Party Committee of Gorky Oblast and Tula Oblast in agriculture.
    Comrade Khrushchev explained in detail the task of vigorously expanding the planting area of corn, saying that this is the main link in striving to increase grain production and to increase livestock production. This has been very clearly stated in the resolution of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. However, it is necessary to mention this again, because many workers, including the secretaries of the state party committees, do not understand the role of corn, regard corn as a side business of grain, and are reluctant to plant corn. This attitude towards things is very dangerous. If the secretary of the state committee or district committee, the chairman of the collective farm, or the director of the state farm have such an attitude towards corn, then they cannot solve the task of increasing grain production, and therefore cannot guarantee that the production of livestock products will obtain the necessary amount of increase.
    As everyone knows, Kalinin Oblast is one of the most backward regions. The yield of grain, potatoes, and vegetables in Kalinin Oblast is very low, and animal husbandry here is in a state of neglect. It is enough to mention the following facts to illustrate the problem: last year, the milk yield per cow here was 898 kilograms, and the amount of milk delivered and sold averaged only 21 quintals per hundred hectares of land. Comrade Khrushchev pointed out that the backwardness of Kalinin Oblast is the result of the unsatisfactory leadership of the state committee of the Party in agriculture.
    Comrade Kiselyov, the secretary of the Kalinin Oblast Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, spoke at this meeting. How does he intend to rectify the work, and how does he understand the resolution of the January Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party? It turns out that Comrade Kiselyov has found a way out: starting with planting rapeseed. In his opinion, rapeseed can improve animal husbandry. A secretary of a state party committee actually said such a thing! He still intends to rely on rapeseed to obtain milk and meat after the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, so how can he mobilize people to fight for increased grain and livestock production? Moreover, the fleshy root crops in Kalinin Oblast, including winter rapeseed, can only harvest 30 to 40 quintals per hectare! A person who puts his hopes on winter rapeseed is like a person sitting in a small boat without oars, drifting in a turbulent river. Wherever the river takes him, he goes...
    Comrade Kiselyov, you plant winter rapeseed and squeeze out 800 to 900 kilograms of milk from a cow in a year, which means that you can only produce a total of 47 quintals of milk per hundred hectares of cultivated land, while Comrade Arepiev, the chairman of the "New Life Road" collective farm in Moscow Oblast, who spoke here, planted corn and thereby received corn and silage. The milk yield per cow in this collective farm is 3,409 kilograms, which means that the milk produced per hundred hectares of cultivated land exceeds 600 quintals! Don't these materials explain the problem?
    Comrade Khrushchev said that the corn problem is not a new problem. V.I. Lenin paid special attention to corn in the early years after the establishment of the Soviet regime, believing that corn was a crop that could increase the country's grain production in the short term.
    Our Party Central Committee proposed the task of expanding the corn planting area to 15 million hectares as early as 1930. However, this task was not completed at that time. But now we must not abandon the task proposed by the January Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. Corn is not only feed grain, but also an excellent food crop.
    It must be pointed out that some of our scientists have spread an incorrect view, they insist that corn is a crop that can only be planted in the south, and its growing area is very limited, and it is a very labor-intensive crop. This is not correct. Now, we believe that it is appropriate to harvest corn when it is in the milky wax stage, rather than letting it dry and harden. In this way, we have eliminated the boundaries for promoting this crop. Comrades, I have documents to show that corn can even grow in Yakutia!
    We believe that as long as scientists and practitioners devote themselves to corn, then in the near future we will be able to obtain the kind of corn that can grow and yield abundantly throughout the Soviet Union. This is something that human hands can do.
    A considerable part of Comrade Khrushchev's speech was about increasing flax production. He pointed out that Kirov Oblast, Kostroma Oblast, Kalinin Oblast, Kaluga Oblast, Bryansk Oblast, Gorky Oblast, Smolensk Oblast, and many other states in the non-black soil zone have rich experience in planting flax. However, in recent years, the flax industry in most of these states has declined. For example, the flax planting area in Kirov Oblast was 146,000 hectares before the war, but last year it was only 46,000 hectares.
    The interests of the country require the elimination of backwardness in the flax industry. By relying on the experience of advanced flax growers, the collective farms in the non-black soil zone can multiply flax production in a short period of time.
    Comrade Khrushchev also pointed out that the collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms in the non-black soil zone have a significant role to play in increasing the production of potatoes and vegetables. He said that as long as the square-cluster planting method and square planting method are used to cultivate these crops, their production can reach a level that can completely meet the needs of cities and industrial centers, as well as the needs of industry for potatoes and vegetables, within one year.
    The major shortcomings of the Ministry of State Farms of the Russian Federation, local party organizations, and Soviet organs in leading the work of state farms were severely criticized. As many people have pointed out in their speeches, many state farms in the non-black soil zone receive very little product per hundred hectares of cultivated land. This proves that the organization level of production is very low and the existing potential in state farms is not being well utilized. However, the Ministry of State Farms of the Russian Federation and local party organizations did not go deep into understanding the work of each state farm, did not give them specific help in formulating economic development plans, and did not well publicize and promote the experience of model state farms. Why is this? This is because the leaders of the Ministry of State Farms are unwilling to leave their documents, unwilling to leave their offices, and unwilling to set foot on the land of the state farms.
    Comrade Khrushchev pointed out that the procurement system must be revised more quickly in accordance with the resolutions of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. The number of personnel in the procurement organs must be greatly reduced, and the role and responsibility of machine tractor stations in procurement work must be enhanced.
    When Khrushchev talked about the incentive system for encouraging increased agricultural production, he pointed out that rewards should be based entirely on the amount of agricultural products produced per hundred hectares of cultivated land.
    Comrade Khrushchev continued, the states in the Central Non-Black Soil Zone have huge untapped potential and uncultivated virgin land. This uncultivated virgin land is millions of hectares of completely fallow land. For example, if corn is planted on this fallow land, then we can harvest several hundred million more poods of grain and a lot of silage feed.
    Comrade N.S. Khrushchev especially emphasized the issue of correctly selecting leading cadres for collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms. He emphasized that the truly most advanced, politically mature, and well-performing comrades should be sent to work in machine tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms. Comrade Khrushchev severely criticized the party organizations in Moscow and Moscow Oblast, which last year had introduced some incompetent workers to work in machine tractor stations. Comrade Khrushchev said that it should be found out who introduced these people, and those who did this should be punished. Now, when selecting advanced workers to serve as leaders of collective farms in accordance with the resolutions of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet Council of Ministers, the mistakes made last year should by no means be repeated.
    People should be introduced to collective farms to take on leadership positions: they should not disgrace us, they should truly be worthy of being envoys of the Party, worthy of being envoys of the working class sent to the countryside, and they should have the ability to organize the men and women members of the collective farm to complete the Party's resolutions on agriculture.
    Comrade N.S. Khrushchev finally talked about the decisive role of organizational work in the tasks of further developing agriculture. He said that we must understand life and agricultural production more deeply. Our cadres must persistently learn from advanced figures and innovators in agricultural production, and must enrich themselves and others with knowledge of scientific achievements and advanced experience. Our local leaders must issue fewer general instructions and orders, and do more organizational work directly for the people in collective farms, machine tractor stations, state farms, and in various work teams and work groups, touching everyone in this work. The strength of our leadership lies in this. Our cadres should work with real enthusiasm; they should show initiative in the work they undertake.
    Khrushchev concluded by saying that we have all the necessary conditions to complete the task of rapidly improving agriculture. We have the excellent resolutions of the January Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. Agriculture is constantly being equipped with new technologies. The countryside is constantly being supplemented with experienced cadres. A new planning system has been adopted that is sufficient to give full play to the initiative of local leaders and collective farm members. Material incentive measures have been formulated to increase agricultural production. The current issue is to organize and mobilize people to complete the tasks that have been put forward.
    Now, organizational skills are needed more than ever in implementing the decisions of the Party and the government. If we can correctly organize the work, then the task of increasing grain production and livestock production formulated by the January Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party does not have to wait until 1960 to be completed, but can be completed much earlier, that is, in the next two or three years.
    In the struggle to build communism, our heavy industry plays a decisive role. Therefore, we must continue to develop the metallurgical industry, the coal mining industry, the petroleum industry, the chemical industry, and the machine manufacturing industry at a high speed, and advance the cause of electrification. This is the guarantee of the strength and prosperity of our socialist motherland, the guarantee of strengthening our national defense forces and continuously improving the material welfare of the people. This is the guarantee of the victory of communism.
    The Soviet state is moving forward with confidence. Leading it forward is the great Communist Party created by the great Lenin, armed with the invincible Marxist-Leninist theory, and tested and tempered in battle.

    在苏联中央非黑土地带农业工作者会议上
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志发表演说
    苏联中央非黑土地带各州和各自治共和国农业工作者会议，七日在克里姆林宫闭幕了。像过去两天一样，在闭幕会议上继续讨论了苏联部长会议副主席帕·洛巴诺夫同志的报告。
    苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在会上发表了长篇演说，受到与会者热烈的欢迎。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志说：许多出色的人在这个讲坛上讲了话。他们说，中央非黑土地带的集体农庄和国营农场拥有极大的潜力来增加谷物、马铃薯、亚麻、蔬菜以及奶类、肉类和其他畜产品的生产。我们大家都非常注意地听取了斯摩棱斯克州日洛诺娃雅同志、加里宁州尼洛娃同志、莫斯科州阿雷皮耶夫同志、利森州叶弗雷摩娃雅同志、伊凡诺佛州女共青团员雅尼契金娜同志、这个会议的来宾、乌克兰农业先进工作者谢尔宾纳同志、萨乌赫同志以及许多其他人的讲话。在我们国内有成千成万像他们一样的农业和畜牧业的能手。我们有许多很好的集体农庄和国营农场以及很好的整个区。它们的经验应当大力地加以宣传和运用到生产当中去。
    某些州是有成绩的，这些州的领导人正确地了解了党中央委员会全体会议的决议，并真正在集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场中进行了切实的组织工作。可以举利森州的情况作为例子，这个州的集体农庄去年每头奶牛的出奶量增加了四百一十二公斤。今年，这个州的指标比非黑土地带其他各州都要高。我认为，利森州党委会是正确的，州委会的书记拉里昂诺夫同志是热情工作的。
    但是，我今天主要不是谈成绩，而是要对中央非黑土地带某些州和自治共和国的领导人员提出一些批评性的意见。
    你们都知道，苏共中央全会提出了保证每年至少收获一百亿普特谷物的任务。这是一个十分艰巨而责任重大的任务。这个任务应当经常激励我们每一个人，号召全体苏联人民前进。为实现这个任务而奋斗——这就是我们在提高农业方面的全部工作中的主要的起决定性作用的工作。谁忘记了这个任务，离开这个任务，仅是限于空谈，谁就是用废话来淹没了这个非常重大的事业。
    我们怎样才能把谷物生产增加到一百亿普特呢？苏共中央一月全体会议的决议对这个问题作了详尽的答复。中央一月全会的决议的力量在于：它指出了解决这个全民任务的途径，指出了保证增产谷物的具体源泉，这就是：提高一切耕地的单位面积产量，减少收获时的损失，开垦生荒地和熟荒地，大大扩大玉蜀黍的播种面积。
    赫鲁晓夫同志继续说，如果不改变农业计划工作，要解决这个任务是不可能的。假使剥夺了集体农庄主席根据农庄具体情况来计划经济的权利，那么就很难做什么事情。当给集体农庄主席下命令要他播种大麦时，他是不能不执行这个命令的，而只好播种，虽然他知道每公顷只能收大麦五公担，虽然他知道，播种这种作物在经济上是不合算的。在这种制定计划的办法下，计划本身就造成了谷物不能丰收。集体农庄主席当然可以努力使这种作物获得最大限度的产量，但这却不能使集体农庄急剧地增加谷物的收获量。可是，在同样的条件下，如果以产量更高的作物来代替产量少的作物，那末集体农庄获得的谷物就可以多几倍。
    中央一月全会认为必须改变计划工作。苏共中央和苏联部长会议三月份采取了关于新的计划制度的专门决议。但是可以说，各地都正确地了解这个决议的意义吗？赫鲁晓夫同志说，还不能这样说。许多州和区继续墨守老的计划制度，没有发挥一切潜力以便就在今年大大增加农作物的生产。这就是苏共中央委员会在这方面所掌握的事实。
    苏萨宁斯克区斯大林集体农庄是科斯特罗马州先进的集体农庄之一。它有着一切的可能在一九六○年以前大大地提前完成苏共中央一月全体会议所规定的每百公顷土地农产品的最低生产量。但是，三月八日科斯特罗马州“北方真理报”所发表的这个集体农庄的措施规定，在一九六○年集体农庄的生产达到上述的水平。不但如此，而且像谷物、肉类、牛奶、鸡蛋、羊毛等这些重要项目的生产只编制了到一九六○年的计划，没有规定一九五五年和以后几年这些产品生产的总产量。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫强调指出，如果先进的集体农庄的计划是这样，那末它怎么能给中等的和落后的集体农庄做榜样呢？既然报纸发表了这样的消息，那末应当认为，制定这项计划时也有州组织领导工作人员参加的。因此，他们没有正确地理解新的计划制度。如果州党委和区党委书记们能够亲自去访问集体农庄，和集体农庄庄员们商量商量，征求一下他们的意见，和他们谈谈聊聊，那末，这样订出来的计划对学习先进集体农庄经验的其他集体农庄也是会有用处的。但是，科斯特罗马州领导者们显然到现在还没有真正理解关于新的计划制度的决议，也没有帮助各集体农庄正确地进行这件重要的工作。
    而这并不是个别的例子。布利安斯克州党委和州执行委员会不但没有具体地去帮助各集体农庄编制计划，反而用高高在上的官僚主义的工作方法干起这件事来了。三月十八日州党委书记彼得霍夫同志和州执行委员会主席达多诺夫同志发给各区一纸公文，要各区在三月二十五日以前完成制定实现苏共中央一月全会决议的各项措施的工作。三月十八日发出这样一个严厉的指令，而竟要求所有集体农庄在三月二十五日以前交出计划！可是大家晓得，在这样一个期限中，许多集体农庄甚至还收不到这个指令哩。同志们，你们为什么要自己欺骗自己呢？在发给各区的指令中还附上一个指标表，要各集体农庄根据这些指标来制定措施。这个指标表长达十页，大约有两千项指标。州党委书记和州执行委员会主席在签署这个指令时，未必看过这些指标。如果他们肯仔细看一遍，也许就不至于发出如此官僚主义的公文了。
    赫鲁晓夫同志举出了基洛夫州实际工作中的一个例子。那里在制定增产谷物和畜牧业产品的措施时犯了严重的错误。维亚特斯科波梁区的措施规定在一九五五年共收获两万吨谷物，但这个区的集体农庄在一九五三年就已经收获了两万一千吨谷物。况且，这个计划是在中央一月全会作出决议以后制定的！　
    请看，一些同志是怎样理解这些要求大大增加谷物生产的决议。布伊斯克区、波哥罗德区、列别格区、罗日金区的措施中也没有规定要增加谷物生产。基洛夫州的十个区只准备在一九五五年及以后几年稍微增加一些玉蜀黍的播种面积。而且只计划用玉蜀黍来做青储饲料。
    图拉州也有类似的例子。图拉州的“公社社员报”三月十五日发表了一个先进集体农庄——叶夫列莫夫区的“十月革命十一周年”集体农庄一九五五—一九六○年的计划。这个计划规定到一九六○年每一百公顷土地的肉、牛奶、蛋及其他产品的产量，要比苏共中央全会决议中规定的少得多。而报纸却把这个不正确的计划宣传成是模范的计划！
      “高尔基真理报”和其他一些州级报纸也刊载了这一类的所谓计划。
    高尔基州和图拉州发展农业的条件很有利，但是利用得却不好。这两个州的集体农庄和国营农场的牛奶、肉类和其他畜牧业产品生产得太少了，在发展谷物、马铃薯和蔬菜生产方面严重地落后了。例如，高尔基州去年的挤奶量每头奶牛为一千零七十五公斤，图拉州为一千一百六十五公斤。马铃薯和蔬菜的产量很低。这些事实，使人对高尔基州和图拉州党委会领导农业的情况感到严重不安。
    赫鲁晓夫同志详细说明了大力扩大玉蜀黍播种面积的任务，他说，这是争取增加谷物出产以及对增加畜牧业产品生产的主要环节。对于这一点，苏共中央全体会议的决议中已经说得非常清楚。不过，还需要再一次提起这件事，因为许多工作人员，其中包括州的党委会书记还不懂得玉蜀黍的作用，把玉蜀黍看成是谷物的某种副业，不乐意种植玉蜀黍。这种对待事情的态度非常危险。州委会或区委会的书记、集体农庄主席、国营农场场长对玉蜀黍抱着这样的态度，就不能解决增产谷物的任务，因而也就不能保证畜牧业产品的生产获得必要数量的增加。
    大家知道，加里宁州是最落后的地区之一。加里宁州的谷物、马铃薯、蔬菜的产量很低，这里的畜牧业处于无人照管的状况。只要提一下下面的事实就足以说明问题了：去年，这里每头奶牛的挤奶量为八百九十八公斤，而牛奶的缴售量和出售量平均每百公顷土地只有二十一公担。赫鲁晓夫同志指出，加里宁州的落后现象是党的州委会对农业的不能令人满意的领导的结果。
    苏共加里宁州委会书记基谢廖夫同志在这个会议上发过言。他究竟打算怎样整顿工作，他是怎样理解苏共中央一月全会的决议的呢？原来，基谢廖夫同志找到了这样一条出路：从种油菜着手。依他的看法，油菜可以提高畜牧业。一个州党委书记竟说出了这样的话！他居然在苏共中央全会以后还打算靠油菜来获得牛奶和肉，那末他又怎么能去动员人们为增产谷物和畜产品而斗争呢？况且，加里宁州的肉质直根类作物，包括冬油菜在内，每公顷只可以收获三十到四十公担！把希望寄托在冬油菜上面的人，就好似这么一个人，这个人坐着没有桨的小船，在波浪汹涌的河里漂流着。河水要把他带到那里，他就到那里……
    基谢廖夫同志，你播种冬油菜，一年从一条奶牛身上挤出八百到九百公斤奶，也就是说，每一百公顷耕地上总共只能出产四十七公担牛奶，而在这里发过言的莫斯科州“新生活之路”集体农庄主席阿雷皮耶夫同志种了玉蜀黍，从而收到了玉米和青贮料。这个集体农庄的每头奶牛产奶三千四百零九公斤，也就是说，一百公顷耕地所产的牛奶超过六百公担！难道这些材料还不能说明问题吗？
    赫鲁晓夫同志说，玉蜀黍问题不是什么新问题。弗·伊·列宁在苏维埃政权建立后的头几年就特别注意玉蜀黍，认为玉蜀黍是可以在短期内增加国家谷物生产的农作物。
    我们党中央委员会早在一九三○年就提出了把玉蜀黍播种面积扩大到一千五百万公顷的任务。不过，那时并没有完成这个任务。但是，现在我们决不能放弃苏共中央一月全会所提出的任务。玉蜀黍不仅是饲料谷物，而且是极好的粮食作物。
    必须指出，我们的某些科学家散布了一种不正确的观点，他们硬说玉蜀黍是一种只能在南方种植的农作物，它的生长地带是十分有限的，这是一种十分费劳力的农作物。这是不正确的。现在，我们认为，在玉米呈乳蜡状时就收割，而不要使玉米干硬，是适当的。这一来，我们就消除了推广这种农作物的界限。同志们，我有文件可以说明：玉蜀黍甚至在雅库特也是可以生长的！
    我们相信，只要科学家和实际工作者致力于玉蜀黍，那末在不久的将来我们就能获得可以在苏联全境内生长和丰收的那种玉蜀黍。这是人类的手可以做到的事。
    赫鲁晓夫同志的讲话有相当大一部分谈到增加亚麻生产的问题。他指出，基洛夫州、科斯特罗马州、加里宁州、卡卢加州、布利安斯克州、高尔基州、斯摩棱斯克州和非黑土地带的其他许多州在栽植亚麻方面有丰富的经验。但是，最近几年，其中大多数州的亚麻种植业衰退了。譬如，基洛夫州的亚麻播种面积在战前有十四万六千公顷，而去年却只有四万六千公顷。
    国家的利益要求消除亚麻业中的落后现象。只要依靠先进亚麻栽培者的经验，非黑土地带的集体农庄可以在短期内把亚麻生产增加好几倍。
    赫鲁晓夫同志还指出，非黑土地带的集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场在增加马铃薯和蔬菜生产中，有重大的作用。他说，只要采用正方穴播法和正方播种法来栽培这些农作物，就能在一年之内使它们的生产达到可以完全满足城市和工业中心的需求，以及工业对马铃薯和蔬菜的需要的水平。
    俄罗斯联邦国营农场部、地方党组织和苏维埃机关在领导国营农场的工作中的重大缺点，受到了严厉的批评。正如许多人的发言中所指出的，非黑土地带的许多国营农场每一百公顷耕地所得到的产品还很少。这就证明：生产的组织水平很低，国营农场中现有的潜力利用得不好。而俄罗斯联邦国营农场部和地方党组织却没有去深入了解每个国营农场的工作，没有在拟定经济发展计划方面给它们以具体帮助，没有很好地宣传和推广模范国营农场的经验。这是由于什么原因呢？这是因为国营农场部的领导人不愿离开公文，不愿离开自己的办公室，不愿踩到国营农场的土地上去。
    赫鲁晓夫同志指出，必须更快地根据苏共中央全会的决议修改采购制度。必须大大缩减采购机关的人员，提高机器拖拉机站在采购工作中的作用和责任。
    赫鲁晓夫谈到鼓励增产农产品的奖励制度时指出，应当完全根据每一百公顷耕地生产的农产品的多少来进行奖励。
    赫鲁晓夫同志接着说，中央非黑土地带各州有巨大的潜力尚未利用，有尚未开垦的生荒地。这种未开垦的生荒地就是几百万公顷的完全休闲地。举例说，如果在这块休闲地上播种玉蜀黍，那末我们就能多收几亿普特谷物和许多青储饲料。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志特别着重谈到正确地挑选集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的领导干部的问题。他强调指出，应该把真正最先进的、政治上成熟的、在工作中表现良好的同志派到机器拖拉机站、集体农庄、国营农场中去。赫鲁晓夫同志严厉地批评了莫斯科市和莫斯科州的党组织，它们去年曾经把某些不称职的工作者介绍到机器拖拉机站去工作。赫鲁晓夫同志说，应当查明这种人是谁介绍的，并且处分干这种事的人。现在，在按照苏共中央和苏联部长会议的决议挑选先进的工作者去担任集体农庄的领导工作的时候，无论如何不应再犯去年所犯的错误。
    应当介绍这种人到集体农庄去担任领导工作：他们要不致于丢我们的脸，他们要真正配当党的使者，配当工人阶级派到农村去的使者，他们要有能力组织集体农庄男女庄员去完成党关于农业的决议。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志最后谈到了在进一步发展农业的任务中，组织工作所起的有决定意义的作用。他说，我们必须更深入地了解生活，了解农业生产。我们的干部必须坚持不懈地向先进人物学习，向农业生产革新者学习，必须用科学成就和先进经验的知识充实自己和别人。必须使我们的地方领导人员少发些一般性的指示和命令，而直接在集体农庄、机器拖拉机站、国营农场，在各个工作队和工作组对人们多做些组织工作，在这一工作中触动每一个人。我们的领导的力量就在于此。我们的干部应该真正热情地工作；应该在所担负的工作中表现出主动精神。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，我们具备一切必要的条件来完成急速提高农业的任务。我们有苏共中央一月全会的出色的决议。农业在不断用新技术装备起来。农村不断补充着有经验的干部。采用了足以发挥地方领导人员和集体农庄庄员的主动精神的新的计划制度。对增加农产品生产拟定了物质奖励的措施。目前的问题是要组织和发动人们来完成所提出的任务。
    现在，在实现党和政府的决议方面比任何时候都需要组织的技能。如果我们能正确地组织工作，那末，苏共中央一月全会所制定的关于增加谷物生产和畜牧业产品生产的任务，就不必到一九六○年才能完成，而可能大大提前，即在最近两、三年内就可以完成。
    在建设共产主义的斗争中，我们的重工业起着决定性的作用。因此，我们今后仍要高速度地发展冶金工业、采煤工业、石油工业、化学工业和机器制造业，把电气化事业向前推进。这就是我们社会主义祖国的强大和繁荣的保证，是加强我国国防力量和不断提高人民物质福利的保证。这就是共产主义胜利的保证。
    苏维埃国家满怀信心地前进。领导它前进的是伟大的列宁所缔造起来的、以战无不胜的马克思主义—列宁主义学说武装起来的、久经考验和在战斗中锻炼出来的共产党。
