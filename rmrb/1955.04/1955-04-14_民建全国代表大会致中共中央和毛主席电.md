Telegram from the National Congress of the China Democratic National Construction Association to the CPC Central Committee and Respected Chairman Mao:

Under the care and leadership of the Party and you, Chairman, the first National Congress of the China Democratic National Construction Association in the ten years since its establishment has now successfully concluded after twelve days of meetings. We, all the delegates, on behalf of all members of the Association, extend our highest respects to you!

The main task of our National Congress was to determine the future direction and tasks of the Association, revise the articles of association, and elect new members of the central leadership. After careful study by all the delegates, we further clarified the future direction and tasks of our Association, which are to unite and educate the national bourgeoisie to actively accept socialist transformation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and you, Chairman, adhere to the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies, and jointly strive to build a socialist society, in accordance with the requirements of the general task of the state during the transition period.

We deeply feel that this is a glorious and arduous task. The smooth completion of this task will be conducive to the realization of the general task of the state during the transition period, and thus fully accords with the highest interests of the people of the whole country. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and you, we will certainly be able to complete this glorious historical task.

We send our respects and wish you good health!

            The First National Congress of the China Democratic National Construction Association
