Guangdong Province is actively promoting the experience of grafting sweet potatoes with moonflowers. Since the Central Committee of the CCP South China Bureau and the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee issued the decision to promote moonflower grafting of sweet potatoes, Party committees and governments at all levels have successively held meetings to formulate specific promotion plans. It is planned to plant a total of 70,000 to 80,000 mu of sweet potatoes on all the province's demonstration farms and agricultural production cooperatives. With an average yield of 5,000 jin per mu, this will produce 3 to 4 million dan of sweet potatoes, more than five times the current average yield of sweet potatoes per crop in the province.

By the end of March, 54 jin of moonflower seeds had been purchased and allocated to various regions. After these seeds are cultivated into moonflower seedlings, they can be used to graft sweet potatoes on more than 26,000 mu.

In order to actively promote this experience, in March, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture, the Preparatory Committee of the South China Institute of Science, the South China Agricultural College, the Zhongkai Senior Agricultural School… and other five units formed the "Guangdong Province Moonflower Grafting Sweet Potato Technology Guidance Group." The agricultural offices of the five administrative offices of Guangdong Province will also establish similar organizations.

    广东推广月光花嫁接甘薯经验
    广东省正在积极推广月光花嫁接甘薯的经验。自中共中央华南分局和广东省人民委员会发出推广月光花嫁接甘薯的决定后，各级党委和政府已先后召开会议，制定具体的推广计划。计划在全省各示范农场，各农业生产合作社共种植甘薯七、八万亩，以每亩平均生产五千斤计，将可出产甘薯三、四百万担，比现在全省每造甘薯的平均产量增加五倍以上。
    到三月下旬止已采购月光花种子五十四斤，并已调拨到各地。这些种子育成月光花苗后，即可嫁接甘薯二万六千多亩。
    为着积极推广这一经验，三月间，广东省农业厅、华南科学研究所筹备委员会、华南农学院、仲恺高级农业学校……等五个单位组成了“广东省推广月光花嫁接甘薯技术指导小组”。广东省的五个行政公署的农业处也将成立类似组织。
