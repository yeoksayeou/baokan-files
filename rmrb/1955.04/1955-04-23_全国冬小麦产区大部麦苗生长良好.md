Most winter wheat areas in the country have good wheat growth, and winter wheat in Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Fujian and other provinces has been harvested or is being harvested.

In the Pearl River basin and other regions where wheat harvesting has begun, most wheat crops can be increased compared to last year, except for some wheat that suffered severe frost and drought damage last winter and this spring. In most parts of central, western, and eastern Guangdong Province, the average yield of winter wheat is more than one hundred catties per mu. Among the eleven special zones producing winter wheat in Yunnan Province, eight special zones can increase production compared to last year. Winter wheat in Guizhou Province is also generally increased compared to last year.

The Yellow River and Huai River basins, the main winter wheat producing areas, had multiple snowfalls last winter, which generally benefited the overwintering of wheat seedlings; although there were several cold waves this spring, they had little impact on the wheat seedlings. Farmers in these areas have mostly carried out timely activities such as hoeing and harrowing, topdressing, watering, and pest control in the wheat fields, which promoted the growth of wheat seedlings. Recently, some areas in Shandong, Shaanxi and other provinces suffered slight frost damage, which had little impact on the wheat seedlings. Now, the wheat seedlings in Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces are mostly strong and are starting to joint, and some have already eared. Farmers in these areas are continuing to strengthen field management, prepare to fight against natural disasters, and strive for a bumper harvest of winter wheat.

Most of the wheat seedlings sown in a timely manner in the Yangtze River basin are growing well; some of the late-sown wheat seedlings were affected by cold and frost, but after strengthening field management, the growth has improved. Now most of the wheat seedlings in these areas have eared and headed, and will be harvested soon.

The total area of ​​winter wheat in the country in 1955 exceeded the plan by 1.5 percent, an increase of more than 5.8 million mu compared with last year. During the autumn and winter wheat planting period last year, according to the requirements of the state, the southern provinces expanded the wheat fields by using idle winter fields, and the northern provinces appropriately reduced the wheat fields in order to expand cotton fields.

### 全国冬小麦产区大部麦苗生长良好

    全国冬小麦产区大部麦苗生长良好
    目前全国冬小麦产区大部麦苗生长良好，广东、广西、云南、福建等省的冬小麦有的已经割完或正在收割。
    已经开始麦收的珠江流域和其他地区，除部分麦子在去冬今春受冻、旱灾害较重外，大部可比去年增产。广东省粤中、粤西和粤东大部地区的冬小麦，平均每亩产一百多斤。云南省出产冬小麦的十一个专区中，有八个专区可比去年增产。贵州省的冬小麦，一般也比去年增产。
    冬小麦主要产区黄河流域和淮河流域去冬多次降雪，一般有利于麦苗过冬；今春虽有几次寒潮，但对麦苗影响不大。这些地区的农民大都及时开展了麦田锄耙、追肥、浇水、治虫等活动，促进了麦苗的生长。最近山东、陕西等省部分地区遭到轻微的霜冻，对麦苗影响很小。现在河南、河北、陕西、安徽、江苏等省的麦苗大部健壮，正开始拔节，有的已孕穗。这些地区的农民正在继续加强田间管理，准备和自然灾害作斗争，争取冬小麦丰收。
    长江流域各地大部适时播种的麦苗生长较好；部分迟播的麦苗曾受寒冻影响，在加强田间管理后，生长已有好转。现在这些地区的麦苗大多已孕穗、抽穗，不久就可收割。
      一九五五年全国冬小麦总面积超过计划百分之一点五，比去年扩大五百八十多万亩。去年秋、冬种麦期间，根据国家的要求，南方各省利用冬季休闲田扩大了麦田，北方各省为扩大棉田而适当缩小了麦田。（新华社）
