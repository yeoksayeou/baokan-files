To the Editor:

On both sides of the streets of Jilin City, there are seventeen dazzling oil paintings, painted with commodity advertisements such as "Changle Toothpaste", "New Rural Toothpaste", and "White Rose Pomade", with the label: Produced by the Local State-owned Jilin Provincial Daily Chemical Factory.

The above advertisements are not only in Jilin City, but also in Tianjin, Jinan, Nanjing, Zhangjiakou, Dalian, Shenyang and other sixty-three cities across the country, with several in each city. In July 1954, the Jilin Provincial Daily Chemical Factory signed a contract with the Shanghai Private Yongli Advertising Agency, tasking Yongli Advertising Agency to make 257 oil painting commodity advertisements for the Jilin Provincial Daily Chemical Factory in the above major cities. Its total area is approximately 90,000 square feet. The contract stipulates that the price per square foot is 800 to 900 yuan (old currency). In November, the Daily Chemical Factory entrusted Yongli Advertising Agency to make another 265 oil painting advertisements. The total cost will be 200 million yuan (old currency). In addition to the oil painting advertisements, 100 million yuan (old currency) was spent on printing twelve kinds of commodity advertisements. This figure is equivalent to the cost price of 1.35 million tubes of toothpaste. According to the person in charge of the supply and marketing section of the Daily Chemical Factory, this money is listed under non-production expenditure items. The factory's cost plan for 1954 budgeted 100 million yuan (old currency) for sales expenses. In fact, non-production expenditures exceeded the plan by two times.

It is necessary and permissible to use a small amount of money to introduce product varieties and quality to the masses, but we completely oppose such extravagant publicity as that of the Jilin Provincial Daily Chemical Factory, because this is a waste of state funds. In the spring of 1953, because the quality of "Peace Toothpaste" was poor and it could not be sold, production was forced to stop; I think it would have been useless to spend more money on publicity at that time; later, thanks to the efforts of all the factory's employees, the quality of the product was improved, coupled with the strong assistance of the state-owned commercial sector, sales improved. This powerfully illustrates that the success of each product's sales mainly depends on the quality of the product, not on advertising.

### 吉林省日用化学工厂  应纠正制作商品广告中的浪费

    吉林省日用化学工厂
    应纠正制作商品广告中的浪费编辑同志：
    在吉林市街道两旁，有十七处耀眼的油画，涂着：“长乐牙膏”、“新农村牙膏”、“白玫瑰香脂”等商品广告，下面标着：地方国营吉林省日用化学工厂出品。
    上面几幅广告，不只是吉林市的街道两旁有十几处，在天津、济南、南京、张家口、大连、沈阳等全国六十三个城市每个城市都有好几处。一九五四年七月，吉林省日用化学工厂和上海私营永利广告社签订了一份合约，由永利广告社为吉林省日用化学工厂在以上各大城市承制二百五十七块油画商品广告。它的总面积约计九万平方市尺。合约规定每平方市尺的价钱是八百到九百元（旧币）。到十一月间，日用化学工厂又委托永利广告社再制二百六十五块油画广告。总共要花两亿元（旧币）。除油画广告外，还花一亿元（旧币）印刷了十二种商品广告。这个数字等于一百三十五万枝牙膏的成本价格。据日用化学工厂供销股负责人说，这笔钱是列在非生产支出项目内。一九五四年这个厂的成本计划中销售费是一亿元（旧币）。实际上非生产开支超过计划两倍。
    用很少量的钱向群众介绍产品品种和质量是必要的，也是允许的，但我们完全反对像吉林省日用化学工厂这种铺张的宣传，因为这是对国家资金的一种浪费行为。一九五三年春天，因为“和平牙膏”质量不好，卖不出去，被迫停止了生产；我想，那时就是花再多的钱去作宣传也是无用的；后来，由于全厂职工的努力，提高了产品的质量，加上国营商业部门的大力协助，销路才有好转。这就有力地说明：每一产品的销路好不好，主要决定于产品的质量好坏，而不是靠做广告。　魏保贤
