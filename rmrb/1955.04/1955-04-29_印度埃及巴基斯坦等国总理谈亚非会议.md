Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 28th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru held a press conference in Calcutta on April 27th while en route from Jakarta back to New Delhi.

Nehru said the Asian-African Conference "is unique, because the countries gathered there had very different opinions on important issues, yet issued a document that showed a great degree of agreement, and which can be solemnly presented as an example to others who neither hold meetings nor agree with others' opinions."

Nehru said that the omission of certain points of the Five Principles in the Asian-African Conference Joint Communiqué does not mean that he has abandoned "any of these moral principles." He added, "I fully abide by the Bandung Communiqué, but this does not prevent me from moving further forward, as long as I do not violate it."

Referring to Premier Zhou Enlai's statement at the Asian-African Conference that the Chinese government is willing to hold talks with the United States government on easing tensions in the Far East and the Taiwan region, Nehru said it was a "fair and good proposal."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 28th: Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser held a press conference in Calcutta on April 27th while en route from Jakarta back to Egypt.

Nasser said of the declaration on promoting world peace and cooperation in the Asian-African Conference communiqué that he did not think the ten principles in the declaration were "different in substance" from the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Regarding Premier Zhou Enlai's statement at the Asian-African Conference that the Chinese government is willing to hold talks with the United States government on the tension in the Far East and Taiwan, Nasser said that Premier Zhou Enlai's suggestion was "reasonable."

Nasser explained to reporters Egypt's attitude against the Turkish-Iraqi pact, saying that Egypt hates any foreign air or army bases in any region of the Middle East. He said that Egypt, which is still struggling to expel the British from Suez, cannot be expected to serve the interests of great powers or great power politics. He said, "The participation of great powers in our own defense arrangements is another form of colonialism."

Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: Pakistan Prime Minister Ali told reporters in Singapore on April 26th while en route from Jakarta back to Pakistan, that the Asian-African Conference contributed to easing tensions in the Far East and the world as a whole. He said the conference was a very insightful experience for all the Asian and African nations that gathered together and discussed various issues in a frank atmosphere.

Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: Colombo Dispatch: Ceylon Prime Minister Kotelawala delivered a speech in the Ceylon House of Representatives on the 26th, discussing the achievements of the Asian-African Conference.

Kotelawala pointed out that the conference was conducted in a sincere atmosphere and said, "We had some differences of opinion, but the spirit of reconciliation and common interests prevailed over everything at the meeting."

Kotelawala said the joint communiqué issued after the meeting "showed the greatest degree of common agreement among the twenty-nine Asian and African countries on issues that are not only important to our region but also to world peace."

Kotelawala emphasized that a very significant achievement of the Asian-African Conference was the mutual understanding gained between China and other Asian and African countries in their views. He said, "This is a significant contribution to peace, and I believe that we are now able to get along well and not invade each other."

After Kotelawala's speech, Opposition Leader W. Dahanayake of the Ceylon House of Representatives proposed a vote of no confidence in the Ceylon government, accusing Kotelawala of the position he took at the Asian-African Conference. According to Reuters, opposition members of parliament believed that Ceylon, as one of the five initiating countries of the Asian-African Conference, should not have sown discord at the conference.

The Ceylon House of Representatives voted on the no-confidence motion on the 27th. It was defeated by a vote of 37 to 14.

Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: According to a report from the Yugoslav News Agency, Yugoslav President Tito, on the 27th, spoke to reporters from Belgrade Radio about the achievements of the Asian-African Conference, saying that although the conference was expected to have great significance, he had not anticipated that it would include so many issues, nor that agreement would be reached on the majority of these issues.

Tito said that the number of Asian and African countries participating in the conference and the great interest that Asian and African countries universally felt in the conference showed that the people of Asia and Africa are determined to decide their own destinies to the greatest extent. Of course, these achievements will only encourage all friends of peace and international cooperation, inspiring them with new hope and confidence that today's peace front constitutes a powerful factor in the fight against new wars and for international cooperation.

    印度埃及巴基斯坦等国总理谈亚非会议
    新华社新德里二十八日电　印度总理尼赫鲁二十七日在从雅加达返回新德里途中到达加尔各答时举行了记者招待会。
    尼赫鲁说，亚非会议“是独一无二的，因为在那儿聚会的国家对于重要问题有着十分不同的意见，然而却发表了一个文件，这个文件显示了很大程度的一致，并且可以很郑重地提出作为对其他既不举行会议又不同意别人意见的人的一个范例。”
    尼赫鲁说，亚非会议联合公报中没有包含五项原则的某几点，并不意味着他已放弃了“这些道义原则中的任何一点”。他又说，“我完全遵守万隆公报，但是这并不妨碍我更前进一步，只要我不违犯它的话。”
    尼赫鲁在谈到周恩来总理在亚非会议上发表的关于中国政府愿意同美国政府就缓和远东和台湾地区的紧张局势的问题举行谈判的声明时说，这是一个“公平、良好的建议”。
    新华社新德里二十八日电　埃及总理纳赛尔二十七日在从雅加达返国途中到达加尔各答时举行了记者招待会。
    纳赛尔谈到亚非会议公报关于促进世界和平和合作的宣言说，他并不认为宣言中的十点原则同和平共处的五项原则“在内容上有什么不同”。
    在谈到周恩来总理在亚非会议上发表的关于中国政府愿意同美国政府就远东和台湾的紧张局势问题举行谈判的声明时，纳赛尔说，周恩来总理的建议是“合理的”。
    纳赛尔向记者们解释埃及反对土耳其—伊拉克条约的态度说：埃及憎恨中东任何地区的任何外国空军基地或陆军基地。他说，不能期望仍然在为把英国人驱逐出苏彝士而斗争的埃及为大国事业或大国政治服务。他说，“大国参加我们自己的防御安排，这是另一种形式的殖民主义”。
    新华社二十八日讯　巴基斯坦总理阿里二十六日在从雅加达回国途中到达新加坡时对记者们说，亚非会议对缓和远东和整个世界紧张局势作出了贡献。他说，对于所有集会在一起并在坦率的气氛中讨论了各个问题的亚非国家说来，会议是一个非常增长见识的经验。
    新华社二十八日讯　科伦坡消息：锡兰总理科特拉瓦拉二十六日在锡兰众议院发表演说，谈论亚非会议的成就。
    科特拉瓦拉指出，这次会议是在诚挚的气氛中进行的，并且说，“我们的意见有过一些分歧，但是，和解的精神和共同的利益在会议上战胜了一切。”
    科特拉瓦拉说，会后发表的联合公报“表示了亚非二十九国之间对一些问题达成了最大程度的共同协议，这些问题不仅对我们的地区是重要的，而且对全世界的和平来说也是重要的。”
    科特拉瓦拉强调说，亚非会议的非常重大的成就是中国和其他亚非国家在看法上所获得的彼此之间的了解。他说，“这是对和平的显著贡献，并且我认为，彼此现在能够和好地相处而互不侵犯。”
    在科特拉瓦拉演说结束后，锡兰众议院反对派领袖吴·鲁·德班达拉纳克提出了一项对锡兰政府的不信任案，指责科特拉瓦拉在亚非会议上所采取的立场。据路透社报道，反对派议员认为，锡兰作为亚非会议的五个发起国家之一不应该在会上散播不和。
    锡兰众议院已在二十七日就这项不信任案进行表决。结果以十四票对三十七票被否决。
    新华社二十八日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社消息，南斯拉夫总统铁托二十七日向贝尔格莱德广播电台的记者谈亚非会议的成就说，虽然预料到这个会议有巨大的意义，可是我不曾想到会包括这样多的问题，也没有想到会就这些问题的大多数达成协议。
    铁托说，参加这个会议的亚非国家的数目以及亚非国家普遍对这个会议感到的巨大兴趣表明，亚洲和非洲人民决心在最大限度上决定他们自己的命运。当然这些成就只会鼓舞所有和平和国际合作的朋友，使他们怀有新的希望和信心，相信今天的和平战线在反对新战争和争取国际合作的斗争中构成一个强有力的因素。
