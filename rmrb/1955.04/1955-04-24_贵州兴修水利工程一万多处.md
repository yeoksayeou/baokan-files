Guizhou Province has completed nearly one-half of its annual task for farmland water conservancy projects this spring. Yinjiang, Zheng'an, Tongzi, Chishui, Pingtang and other counties have completed or overfulfilled their annual farmland water conservancy tasks. Before starting the construction of water conservancy projects, Duyun, Pingtang, Libo and other counties and many townships established special organizations to lead the construction of water conservancy projects. From January to April 10, a total of 1,723 farmer water conservancy technicians were trained in 23 counties across the province, and 315 of them were selected to serve as water conservancy instructors.

From January to March, more than 12,700 water conservancy projects were built throughout the province, expanding the irrigated area by more than 330,000 mu. According to statistics from 22 counties including Dading, Bijie, and Fuquan from January to March, 20,128 mu of land were transformed into arable land. While building farmland water conservancy projects, various regions also renovated more than 25,600 large and small water conservancy projects. (Our correspondent in Guiyang)

    贵州兴修水利工程一万多处
    贵州省今春兴修的农田水利工程已接近全年任务的二分之一。印江、正安、桐梓、赤水、平塘等县已经完成或超额完成全年兴修农田水利的任务。在开始兴修水利以前，都匀、平塘、荔波等县和不少的乡都成立了专门领导兴修水利的机构。从一月份到四月十日止，全省有二十三个县共训练了农民水利技术员一千七百二十三人，并从中选拔了三百一十五人担任水利辅导员。
    一月到三月，全省共兴修水利工程一万二千七百多处，扩大灌溉面积三十三万多亩。根据大定、毕节、福泉等二十二个县一到三月份的统计，土变田的有二万零一百二十八亩。各地在兴修农田水利的同时，还整修了大小水利工程二万五千六百多处。　（本报驻贵阳记者）
