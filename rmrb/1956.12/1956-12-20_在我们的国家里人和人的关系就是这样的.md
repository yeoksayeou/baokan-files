    In Our Country, Relationships Between People are Like This
    New Passengers on the Train
    The train slowly pulled out of Xinhe Station. Soon, news of a pregnant woman's abdominal pain spread through the carriage. Chen Lianke, the person in charge of the train, immediately walked through more than a dozen carriages to the scene and saw a pregnant woman squatting in the toilet, beads of sweat the size of soybeans running down her face. Under the leadership of Comrade Chen, the carriage became busy. Train attendant Nie Xingsheng mobilized the passengers in that carriage to other carriages. Then, the announcer asked for medical personnel.
    Among the passengers were Wang Zhixiang, director of internal medicine at Kailuan Hospital, Zheng Tianjie from Lulong County Hospital, Zhao Zhongwei from Tangshan Hongxie Hospital, and Cong Dong from Zhangzhuang Hospital, all doctors who volunteered to form a temporary midwifery team, while the attendants took on the nursing work. When the train arrived at Lutai Station, a connection was made by telephone with Tangshan Station, asking them to prepare to receive the parturient.
    As the train pulled out of Lutai, the atmosphere in the carriage became even more tense, but the doctors calmly carried out prenatal examinations and nursing work for the parturient. Just then, several cries of a baby were heard. The doctors' faces showed smiles of victory, and the passengers were all excited about the addition of a new little guest to the train. Some sent eggs, some sent brown sugar and other gifts.
    The train pulled into Tangshan Station, and the parturient, escorted by the doctors, entered a prepared ambulance and was sent to the railway hospital. Before leaving, the parturient waved goodbye to the passengers. At this time, there were also several commendatory opinions in the train's suggestion book thanking the people's railway attendants.

    Train Conductor Who Cares for the Sick
    On November 18th, we had to escort a comrade suffering from mental illness to Siping Neuropsychiatric Hospital for treatment, but we were very worried that he would hit people, damage things, or have other accidents on the train. Is it appropriate for such a patient to ride a passenger car?
    That night, we boarded Train 107 from Sankeshu to Shenyang. Unexpectedly, the train conductor warmly received us. When he saw the patient being carried in tied up, he voluntarily gave up the bed in the conductor's office to accommodate the patient, and often cared about the patient's eating and drinking, allowing us to reach Siping smoothly.
    When we arrived at Siping Station, the conductor, seeing that we were unfamiliar with the route, even escorted us to Siping city in the cold weather.
    Now the patient's condition has improved, and when we recall the train conductor's spirit of caring for the suffering of patients and enthusiastically serving passengers, we are very moved. This attitude of serving passengers and patients is worthy of respect and learning.

    Never Dreamed of Being Able to Walk Again
    I am a loading worker in the Inner Mongolia Forestry Industry Bureau. In 1954, I contracted arthritis and was treated in the employee hospital of my unit for a period of time. The doctor transferred me to the Tulihe Hospital for acupuncture treatment, but there was no effect. The leaders of our unit then transferred me to the Arxan Sanatorium for convalescence. Five months later, the illness worsened, and I was bedridden. I was then transferred to Harbin Medical University for treatment. Just then, Minister Kong of the Labor Protection Department of the Bureau Federation of Trade Unions came to the hospital to express condolences and kindly comforted me, telling me to treat recuperation as a task to be completed. At the same time, they gave me a family living allowance of fifty yuan, allowing me to recuperate with peace of mind.
    After staying in the Medical University for half a year, there was still no improvement, and I was sent back to the employee hospital of my unit. The president and doctors re-discussed my condition, and the result was a decision to send me to the China Medical University for treatment. Passing through Tulihe Hospital, I underwent another organizational therapy, which still did not work. Because I was suffering from a chronic illness that would not get better for three to five years, it was decided to let me go home to recuperate, and I was given another ninety yuan for family subsidies, so that my whole family could wear cotton clothes in the winter. Because the organization took care of me meticulously, I was able to recuperate with peace of mind, and by July of this year, I was already able to walk without crutches.
    Now, I am very excited, and I have unspeakable gratitude in my heart. The reason why my condition has improved is entirely because of the Party's care and concern for me. Now I want to strive to recover my health as soon as possible and contribute all my strength to the motherland and the people.

    在我们的国家里人和人的关系就是这样的
    列车里的新客人
    列车徐徐地开出了新河站，不久，一个孕妇肚痛的消息在车厢里传开了。列车负责人陈连科同志立即走过十几节车厢，来到现场，见一位孕妇蹲在厕所里，黄豆大的汗珠从脸上流下来。在陈同志的带头下，车厢里忙碌起来了。列车员聂型生将这节车厢的旅客动员到其它车厢去，接着，广播员在征求医务人员。
    旅客中有开滦医院内科主任王之相，卢龙县医院郑田捷，唐山红协医院赵中韦，张庄医院丛栋等大夫，他们自告奋勇地组成了一个临时助产组，乘务员们担负了护理工作。车到芦台站，在电话中和唐山车站取得了联系，要他们准备接待产妇。
    列车驶出了芦台，车厢里的气氛虽然更加紧张，但大夫们还是沉着地为产妇进行产前检查和护理工作。就在这时，送来了几阵婴儿的哭声，大夫们的脸上露出了胜利的笑容，旅客们都为这列车增添了新的小客人而感到兴奋，有的送来了鸡蛋，有的送来了红糖和其它的礼品。
    列车驶进了唐山站，产妇在大夫们的护送下进入早就准备好的救护车，送到了铁路医院。临别时，产妇向旅客们挥手致意。这时列车的意见簿上也多了几条感谢人民铁路乘务员的表扬意见。

    关怀病人的列车长
    11月18日，我们要护送一个患精神病的同志到四平神经病院去治疗，但我们很担心他会在车上打人、损坏东西或发生其它意外。这样的病人是否适宜坐客车呢？
    当晚我们登上了由三棵树开往沈阳的一零七次列车。出乎意料之外，列车车长热情地接待着我们，当他看见病人被绑抬着，便主动地让出了车长室的床位来安置病人，并经常关心着病人的吃喝，使我们能顺利地到达四平。
    到了四平站，车长见我们路途不熟，在寒冷的天气，又一直送我们到四平市内。
    现在病人的病况已有了好转，当我们回忆起列车长那种关心病人疾苦，热心为旅客服务的精神时，心里非常感动。这种为旅客为病人服务的态度值得敬佩，也值得学习。

    做梦也没有想到再能走路
    我是内蒙古森林工业局的一个装车工人，1954年得了关节炎，在本单位的职工医院治疗了一个时期，大夫把我转到图里河医院进行针灸治疗，未见什么效果，我们单位的领导人又把我转送到阿尔山疗养院疗养。五个月后，病势加重，卧床不起，又把我转送到哈尔滨医科大学医治。就在这时，管理局工会劳保部孔部长来医院进行慰问，并亲切地安慰我，叫我要把养病当作一个任务来完成。同时又给了我五十元的家庭生活补助费，使我能安心休养。
    在医科大学住了半年，仍然没有起色，又把我送回本单位职工医院。院长和大夫们又重新对我的病情进行了讨论，结果决定送我到中国医科大学医治。路经图里河医院，又做了一次组织疗法，还是不行。由于我患的是慢性病，非得三、五年不能好，就决定让我回家疗养，又给了九十元钱的家庭补助费，使我全家人冬天都穿上了棉衣。由于组织上关照得无微不至，自己能安心疗养，到今年7月已经可以丢了拐杖走路了。
    现在，我很兴奋，我的内心有说不出来的感激，我的病情所以好转，完全是因为党对我的照顾和关心。现在我要争取早日恢复健康，把我所有的力量贡献给祖国和人民。
