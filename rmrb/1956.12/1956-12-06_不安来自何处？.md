　　Where Does Unease Come From?
　　Ding Lan
　　A musician traveled from Beijing to Shanghai, and no sooner had he settled down than he became restless. The reason was that the Indian film song "The Tramp's Song" was everywhere. This "sad tone" was so "incompatible with the joyous 'prosperous big city'" that he felt deeply uneasy.
　　The re-screening of the film "The Spring River Flows East" also caused unease among some people, for the same reason: living in a happy society, why show these films to make us cry?
　　The criticism of dogmatism and vulgar sociology also caused panic and unease among these people. It was said that opposing dogmatism would injure the "dignity of Marxism," and that this would bring down "the banner of Marxism."
　　Doctors advise neurasthenia sufferers to "go out less to avoid stimulation." In fact, going out less does not eliminate neurasthenia. Even burying oneself in bed cannot alleviate inner unease. It is better to look for the root cause of the unease. It is not difficult to find that these unease are unfounded.
　　People who love "The Tramp's Song" do not dislike their happy lives and go wandering everywhere. This song will not stop the factory chimneys and kitchen smoke from rising. After watching the movie "The Spring River Flows East," shedding tears did not lead to pessimism about the future of communism, nor did it make people feel that today's life is no longer lovely. People's feelings and lives are complex. Without hate, there would be no sincere love; without sadness, where would laughter come from? Similarly, opposing dogmatism would not harm the "dignity of Marxism," let alone bring down "the banner of Marxism." This is because dogmatism has always been a great enemy of Marxism. Marxism will not fall in the fight against dogmatism, nor is it established by empty shouts of maintenance.
　　If it is for another reason that you are uneasy, then I raise both hands in agreement. That is, think more about why these songs and movies are so popular with the masses, while our good things today are so few? Why can't we use Marxism freely, but are so rigid and dogmatic?

　　不安来自何处？
　　丁蓝
    一位音乐工作者从北京到上海，刚刚坐定就已坐立不安了，原因是印度电影歌曲“流浪者之歌”到处皆是，这种“悲伤的情调”和欢乐的“繁荣的大城市太不相宜”，使得他深感不安。
      “一江春水向东流”电影重演也引起某些人士的不安，原因是相同的：生活在欢乐的社会里，为什么要演这些电影叫我们流眼泪？
    对教条主义和庸俗社会学的鞭挞也引起这些人们的惶恐不安，据说是反对教条主义会碰伤“马克思主义的尊严”，这是倒下“马克思主义的旗帜”。
    医生劝神经衰弱者“少出门，免受刺激”，其实，少出门并不能免除神经衰弱，即使埋头在被窝里也不能减轻内心的不安，还不如去寻找不安的根由。不难发现，这些不安是并没有什么根据的。
    爱上“流浪者之歌”的人，并没有厌恶起幸福的生活而去到处流浪，这歌声也不会叫工厂的烟囱和厨房的炊烟停止冒气；看了“一江春水向东流”的电影，流了眼泪，却没有引起对共产主义前途的悲观，也不会感到今天的生活变得不可爱了。人们的感情、生活是复杂的，没有恨就不会有真挚之爱，没有悲伤，又那里来欢笑。同样的，反对教条主义，那会碰伤“马克思主义的尊严”呢，更不会倒下“马克思主义的旗帜”。这是因为教条主义从来就是马克思主义的大敌，马克思主义是不会在反教条主义中倒下，也不是靠空洞的维护的喊声才建立起来的。
    如果是为另一个缘故而不安，则我举双手赞成。那就是多想想：为什么这些歌曲和电影这样受到群众的欢迎，而我们的今天的好东西又如此之少呢？为什么我们不能自如的运用马克思主义，而是如此生硬教条呢？
