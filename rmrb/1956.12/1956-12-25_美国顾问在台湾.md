American Advisors in Taiwan
Nie Zhiwei

Editor's Note: The author of this article, Nie Zhiwei (Nie Yuwu), was formerly a lieutenant and deputy company commander of the heavy weapons company, 3rd Battalion, 243rd Regiment, 81st Division of the Chiang army. Before dawn on June 30th this year, he risked his life to swim from Dadan Island to Xiamen Island, where he was warmly welcomed by officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army.

Now, he has written two articles about what he saw and heard in the Chiang army: "American Advisors in Taiwan" and "In the Chiang Army," which will be published successively on the fourth page of this newspaper today and tomorrow.

I returned to the mainland from Taiwan at the end of June this year. I was originally an officer in the Chiang army, and had lived on the island of Taiwan since 1948. In recent years, I have personally witnessed Americans coming to Taiwan in batches, and have personally tasted the bitterness of American "advisors."

Americans appear in Taiwan in the guise of "advisors," controlling various institutions in Taiwan. The military is the most tightly controlled. The fact that Americans control the military reflects their enslavement of the entire Taiwan.

The Americans' methods are very insidious and vicious. They do not control the Chiang army by "grabbing everything at once"—that would arouse anti-American sentiment in the army—but by adopting a method of "phased control" and "step-by-step intensification."

American control of the Chiang army can be divided into three stages. From 1950 to 1952, they were active in upper-level institutions, at most reaching the corps or division level, only interfering in some high-level affairs such as policies and plans. During the period from 1952 to 1954, the claws of the "advisors" extended to the platoon level, and the scope of interference expanded to living environment, educational content, training subjects, and exercise plans. Even the construction of a small shooting range had to be approved by the "advisor." As the power of the American "advisors" expanded, anti-American sentiment among officers and soldiers of the Chiang army increased, which caused the Americans a great deal of trouble. They had to send a memorandum to Chiang Kai-shek and the puppet Ministry of National Defense, "Please stop the erroneous attitude of non-cooperation with advisors taken by some officers in your command."

American "advisors" include officers and soldiers. Whether they are officer advisors or soldier advisors, they are all arrogant and conceited. They are all "right," and we are no good at anything; everything must be changed anew and become like the American way. How can anyone with blood and national self-esteem endure this? As a result, an "anti-advisor" sentiment spread among officers at all levels. Everyone had the view that "the American way is not particularly good or worth learning." Many officers sometimes argued with the advisors face to face. The soldiers were also not interested in the "advisors." When the "advisors" came, they cursed them behind their backs.

The Ministry of National Defense realized the seriousness of the situation and quickly issued orders, and forwarded Chiang Kai-shek's handwritten order, which roughly stated: "Recently, it has been found that in various units, a small number of officers do not understand the relationship of Sino-American cooperation and the true meaning of advisors coming to the units, resulting in incidents of non-cooperation and impoliteness towards advisors, which must be corrected immediately. Officers at all levels must cooperate closely with advisors and accept their suggestions. Even if the suggestions are unreasonable, they cannot be debated face to face. Regardless of the advisor's rank, officer or soldier, they should all be treated with respect. If anyone is impolite to the advisor, the officers in charge at all levels must strictly stop them and punish them according to the severity of the circumstances. In the future, all training and exercises shall be based on the translated U.S. military manuals that have been issued." The General Political Department also continuously issued work instructions, strictly prohibiting such incidents, but disputes between Chiang's officers and soldiers and American advisors still occurred. A classmate of mine named Zheng, who was a Chiang army platoon leader, was given a major demerit for arguing with an advisor, and he retired in anger.

From 1954, the Chiang army was basically controlled by the Americans. Their interference expanded to "personnel," "intelligence," "training," "combat," and "logistics." Even the construction of bunkers in Jinmen and Matsu had to be approved by the "advisor." Due to long-term suppression, the Chiang army officers' and soldiers' dissatisfaction with the American "advisors" gradually shifted from surface conflict to inner anger. This anger suppressed in their bellies would erupt when given the chance.

The Americans' bestial life in Taiwan is also extremely hateful. They live in the best areas and the best houses, leading a luxurious and licentious life. On the streets, they embrace Taiwanese girls and swagger through the city. Such ugliness is really not something that we Chinese people with traditional moral values can bear to see. Americans like to drink alcohol, and most of them get drunk when they drink. When they are drunk, they go wild. No matter where they are, they pull and tug at women. I heard that in Keelung, female students have been raped by them.

The Americans also have a trick they like to play, which is to drive cars with one hand holding a woman and the other hand on the steering wheel, running rampant on the road, often running over pedestrians. One day in 1953, I personally saw an "advisor" driving a fast car and running over a child who was nearly ten years old. When the police came over, he said he would pay money, left an address, and drove away. At that time, the onlookers were all angry, and some people shouted, "A life for a life," "Let the American devils roll back!"

The Americans' tyrannical behavior in Taiwan is simply unbearable. The reason why I returned to the mainland is that I did not want to be bullied by the Americans, and I did not want to be a running dog for American imperialism. That is why I disregarded everything and risked my life to throw myself into the embrace of the motherland. (Attached picture)

### 美国顾问在台湾

    美国顾问在台湾
    聂智威
    编者按　本文作者聂智威（聂毓吾），原是蒋军八十一师二四三团三营重兵器连的中尉副连长。今年6月30日黎明前，他冒着生命危险从大担岛泅水到达厦门岛，受到人民解放军官兵的热烈欢迎。
    现在，他把他在蒋军部队里的见闻，写成了两篇文章：“美国顾问在台湾”“在蒋军部队里”，在本报今明两日的第四版上陆续发表。
    我是今年6月底从台湾回到大陆的。我原是蒋军军官，而且从1948年起，就一直住在台湾本岛。几年来，我亲眼看着美国人一批一批地来到台湾，也亲自尝受过美国“顾问”的苦头。
    美国人在台湾以“顾问”姿态出现，控制着台湾的各个机构。被控制得最紧的要算是军队了。由美国人控制军队的事实，可以反映出它对整个台湾的奴役情况。
    美国人的手段是很阴险毒辣的。它掌握蒋军部队不是用“一把抓”的办法——那样将会引起部队的反美情绪，而是采取“分期控制”、“步步加紧”的办法。
    美国人对蒋军的控制可分为三个时期。1950年到1952年，他们是在上层机构活动，顶多是到军或师级为止，仅仅干涉一些高级事务，如政策、计划等。1952年到1954年这一时期，“顾问”的魔掌就伸展到了排级，干涉范围扩大到生活环境、教育内容、训练课目、演习计划等，连修一个小型射击靶场也都要经过“顾问”的批准。随着美国“顾问”权力的扩大，蒋军官兵的反美情绪有了增长，这使得美国人大伤脑筋，他们不得不向蒋介石及伪国防部致备忘录，“请制止贵管部队部分军官所采取与顾问不合作的错误态度”。
    美国“顾问”中有军官，也有士兵，不论是军官顾问或士兵顾问，都很骄傲自大。他们都是“对”的，我们什么都不行；样样都要从新改变，变成美国的样子。凡是有血性、有民族自尊心的人，怎么能忍受得了呢？于是在各级军官中普遍燃起了“反顾问”的情绪。大家都有这样的看法：“佬美这一套并没有特别好的值得学习”。有很多军官有时就同顾问当面争吵起来。士兵也同样对“顾问”不感兴趣，“顾问”一来，他们就在背地里咒骂。
    国防部发觉了这种严重形势，就赶快颁发命令，并转下蒋介石的手令，大意是说：“近查各部队，有少数军官不了解中美合作之关系，及顾问到部队之真正意义，致时有对顾问不合作、不礼貌之事件发生，亟应加以纠正。各级军官必须与顾问密切合作，接受顾问的建议，即建议有不合理时，也不能当面提出辩论。不论顾问阶级大小，或官或兵，都应一律向他们表示尊敬。若有对顾问不礼貌者，各级主官须严加制止，并按情节轻重予以处罚。以后举凡训练、演习，均应以颁发之翻译美军操典为准”。总政治部也不断发下工作指示，严令制止这类事件，但蒋军官兵同美国顾问的争执照样发生。我的一位姓郑的同学是蒋军排长，就是因为同顾问争执而被记了一次大过，他气愤之下就退役了。
    从1954年开始，蒋军部队基本上都操纵在美国人手里了。他们的干涉扩大到“人事”“情报”“训练”“作战”“补给”，就是在金门、马祖修碉堡，也都得“顾问”同意。由于长时间的压制，蒋军官兵对美国“顾问”的不满，渐渐由表面冲突转到内心的愤怒。这种闷在肚子里的怒气，遇有机会就会发作出来。
    美国人在台湾的野兽生活，也是十分可恶的。他们住的是最好的地区和最好的房子，过着奢侈淫荡的生活。在大街上，他们拥抱着台湾姑娘招摇过市。那种丑态，实在不是我们有着传统道德观念的中国人可以看得过去的。美国人好喝酒，而多数是喝了必醉，醉了就乱来。不管在哪里，他们碰到妇女就乱拉乱扯，听说在基隆，就有女学生被他们强奸了。
    美国人还有一个玩的花样，就是一手抱着女人，一手开汽车，在马路上横冲直撞，时常轧死行人。1953年的一天，我亲眼看见一个“顾问”开着快车轧死一个将近十岁的小孩。当警察走过来时，他说赔钱好了，留下一个地址，开车就走。当时围观的老百姓无不气愤，有些人喊，“一命抵一命”，“让美国鬼子滚回去！”
    美国人在台湾的横暴行为，简直叫人不能忍受。我为什么要回到大陆，就是不愿受美国佬的气，不愿替美帝国主义做走狗，所以才不顾一切，冒着生命的危险，投到祖国的怀抱。（附图片）
