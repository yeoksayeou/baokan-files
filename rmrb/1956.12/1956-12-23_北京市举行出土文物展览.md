Xinhua News Agency report:

    An exhibition of more than 700 historical relics unearthed in Beijing in the past six years opened at the Temple of Heaven on the 20th.

    The polished stone axe discovered in Qinghe Town is a relic from the late Neolithic Age. Also excavated in the same area were pottery urn coffins from the Warring States period, as well as pottery buildings, Wushu coin molds, and "Long Live" tile ends from the Han Dynasty.

    A yellow embroidered silk parcel is a precious item in this exhibition. It was unearthed under the twin towers of Qingshou Temple, an ancient temple from the Jin and Yuan dynasties, and is a piece of silk fabric from the Jin and Yuan dynasties that has never been unearthed before.

    Four years ago, during the construction of a breach in the city wall behind the Yonghe Temple, the "Edict on Wang Dechang, Metropolitan Transportation Commissioner of Yuan Dynasty, Leaving Office," carved in the 15th year of the Zhizheng era of the Yuan Dynasty (1355 AD), was unearthed. The inscription is complete and records the water transport warehouse system and water transport methods of the time.

    This exhibition is sponsored by the Cultural Relics Investigation and Research Group of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture. In the past six years, they have sorted out nearly 60,000 cultural relics, and this exhibition is a part of them.

    四年前在雍和宫后开辟城墙豁口工程中掘出了元代至正十五年 （公元1355年）刊立的“元京畿都漕运使王德常去思碑”，碑文完整，记载着当时水运仓库制度和水运方法。
