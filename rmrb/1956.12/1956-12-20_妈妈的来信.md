　　In the evening, the rosy clouds often dye the birch forest on the farm side orange, and the light blue mountains at the end of the forest also appear particularly clear. At this time, the joyful clamor of the reclamation team members gradually subsided, and only the clever skylarks were still calling incessantly over the golden pond.

　　After a day of intense labor, the reclamation team members would wash their faces happily, and then sit or lie in groups of three or five on the soft grass beside the pond to watch the sunset, or sing. Sometimes, you can also squint your eyes to imagine what you most want to imagine, and your heart is as stretched and active as a bird. If you suddenly receive a letter from home at this moment, it would be the best thing, it can make you smell the atmosphere of your hometown in the cool evening breeze of the grassland.

　　This evening, Xiao Dong sat alone on the stone by the water where she washed clothes, and for some reason, she missed her mother. Strangely, when she was at home, her mother took care of her meticulously, but she didn't seem to notice it. But now, even a casual word her mother once said has become a sweet memory. She remembered one night in the second year after the liberation of Jinan, when she was just twelve years old, her mother gently stroked her forehead and asked, "Child, you have grown another year. What do you want to do when you grow up?"

　　"I want to drive a tractor, just like the Soviet aunt in the movie." She looked up, looking at her mother with playful little eyes.

　　"Drive a tractor? Where do you want to go? Are you willing to leave your mother far away? Hmm?" Her mother asked, kissing the back of her little hand.

　　Leaving her mother and going to a very far place was truly unfathomable and unimaginable for her. She just sat there blankly, unable to answer. Later, she fell asleep in her mother's arms.

　　Today, her singing actually floats on the North Manchurian prairie, thousands of miles away from home, and she really stands with her chest out beside that silver-gray tractor. With her delicate hands, she and the young men sowed seeds for the first time on this wasteland that no one had ever cultivated, and she was about to reap her first great harvest. How heroic this is!

　　She also remembered the moment when she said goodbye to her mother at the Jinan Railway Station. On the platform, there were flowers, red flags, cheering crowds, and the noisy sound of gongs and drums. Her mother squeezed out of the crowd and straightened the silk ribbon on her braids for her, but she didn't say anything. She fully understood her mother's feelings. Since her father died, the mother and daughter had depended on each other for more than ten years and had never been apart for a single day. Now she was going to go so far, leaving her mother alone at home... She turned her head and tugged at her mother's hand, wanting to comfort her, but she was stopped by her mother as soon as she uttered the word "Mom": "Child, you don't need to say anything, Mom understands your heart and your aspirations. Go, I'm not sad at all. Take care of yourself."

　　But when the train roared and slowly started, she saw tears in the corners of her mother's smiling eyes from the train window.

　　But why hasn't Mom written yet? She held her cheeks in her hands, wondering. Is it because the street work is too busy? Or is it because I write less and she's angry? She couldn't help but feel some remorse for the past: sometimes she made her mother angry over trivial matters, and once her mother forgot to bring back a packet of peanuts when she came back from buying vegetables, and she cried and refused to let it go. Now... So she decided to write a letter home tomorrow, asking her mother not to be angry, telling her that the farm production here is very busy, and this year they can harvest more than two million catties of grain, and next year they will build dormitories for the farm workers. At that time, she would definitely bring her mother over and promise never to make her angry again.

　　She was lost in thought when Xiao Zhang, a classmate from Jinan, ran over with a smile. She flashed a rectangular object in her hand in front of Xiao Dong's eyes and turned to run.

　　"A letter! A letter from my mother, isn't it? Give it to me, you little rascal, hurry!" She stood up, shouting as she chased.

　　"My dear Jihua daughter..." Xiao Dong opened the letter and read the first sentence breathlessly. What affectionate words! A surge of excitement welled up in the depths of her heart, and she couldn't wait to read on:

　　"...You have now arrived at your most ideal place. Mom misses you, but Mom respects your ideals even more. Your spirit of marching toward difficulties encourages your classmates, and they envy you. After you left, your classmates often came to inquire about you, and I am touched by the kind care of the neighbors. Mom hopes that you will often write to your classmates, and humbly learn from your farm comrades and constantly improve yourself. Mom believes what you said to me in the middle of the night a few days before you left, like that "Soviet aunt" you often talk about, dedicate your precious youth to the most magnificent cause of the motherland. My dear daughter, go forward, Mom is eager for you to be trained into a production expert - a labor model in the harsh environment! Mom's handwriting"

　　After reading the letter, she stood there for a long time, gazing into the distance. Xiao Zhang took the letter and read it again, then put her hand on Xiao Dong's shoulder and said softly:

　　"What a good mother, what are you thinking about, Xiao Dong?"

　　"Good mother..." Xiao Dong repeated as if to herself.

　　But she herself couldn't say exactly why, her eyes were actually wet. The afterglow reflected from the bottom of the water made her eyes glitter with golden light, and she couldn't see clearly all the scenery in front of her: the forest, the mountains, and everything on the grassland.

    妈妈的来信
  　吕建中
    傍晚，彩霞常常把农庄那边的白桦林染成橘黄色，树林尽头淡青色的山峦也显得格外明朗了。这时候，垦荒队员们的欢乐的喧嚷声渐渐平息下来，只有灵俏的云雀还在那荡着金波的池沼上空不住叫唤。
    垦荒队员们紧张劳动了一天，痛痛快快地洗一把脸，然后就三五成群地坐卧在池沼旁边柔软的草地上看晚霞，或者唱歌。有时候，你还可以眯缝着眼睛去想像自己所最愿意想像的事儿，内心里简直像鸟儿般的舒展、活跃。如果这时刻忽然接到一封家信，那就再好也没有了，它能够使你从草原上清冷的晚风里闻到家乡的气息。
    小董这天傍晚独自坐在水边那块洗衣服的石头上，不知怎的她思念起妈妈来了。说也奇怪，在家乡的时候，妈妈对她体贴入微，而自己似乎并不觉得，可是现在，甚至连妈妈曾说过的随便一句什么话，都会成为甜蜜的回忆。她想起济南解放第二年的一个夜晚，那时候自己刚满十二岁，妈妈用手轻轻抚摸着她的额角问道：“孩子，你又长了一岁。等长大了，你想去做什么？”
    “我开拖拉机去，就像电影里的苏联姑姑那样。”她仰着头，用顽皮的小眼睛看着妈妈。
    “开拖拉机？到什么地方去呢？舍得远离开妈妈吗？嗯？”妈妈一边问着，一边吻着她的小手背。
    离开妈妈，到很远的地方去，这在她真是不可捉摸也不能想像的。她只楞楞地坐在那里无从回答。后来就倒在妈妈怀里睡着了。
    今天，她的歌声居然飘荡在离家几千里外的北满草原上了，她真的挺着胸脯站在那银灰色的拖拉机旁边了。她用自己那双娇嫩的手，和年青小伙子们一起在这从来没人耕种过的荒原上第一次播下了种子，而且眼看着就要得到第一个大丰收了，这是多么豪迈的事啊！
    她又想起了在济南车站和妈妈分别的那一刹那。月台上，鲜花、红旗，欢送的人群，喧闹的锣鼓声。妈妈从人丛里挤出来，替她理着发辫上的绸带，但是没有说话。她完全懂得妈妈的心情，自从她父亲死后，母女俩相依为命地过了十几年，从没有离开过一天，现在她竟要走得这么远，家里只留下妈妈一个人了。……她扭过头来，扯着妈妈的手，想安慰妈妈几句，可是她刚吐出“妈妈”两个字，却被妈妈给挡回去了：“孩子，你不用说了，妈妈明白你的心，懂得你的志愿。去吧，我一点不难过。要保重身体。”
    可是当火车吼叫一声，徐徐开动的时候，她却从车窗口看到妈妈微笑的眼角上挂着泪花。
    可是妈妈为什么还不来信呢？她双手托着腮，心里纳闷。是街道工作太忙？还是因为我写信少，生气了？她不由得内心有些忏悔过去：有时因为不大的一点事儿就惹妈妈生气，有次妈妈买菜回来忘了给带一包花生，自己竟哭着不依呢。如今……，于是她决定明天就写一封信回家，请求妈妈不要生气，告诉妈妈，这里农庄生产挺忙，今年能收二百多万斤粮食，明年就要盖庄员宿舍了，那时候，一定把妈妈接来，保证再不惹妈妈生气了。
    她正想得出神，在济南同学的小张笑嘻嘻地跑来了，她把手里的一个长方形的东西在小董眼前一晃，转身就跑。
    “信！我妈妈来的信，是不是？快给我，您这死丫头，快！”她站起来，一边喊，一边追。
   “我亲爱的吉华女儿……”小董打开信，气喘吁吁地读了这头一句。多么亲切的话语啊！她的心灵深处忽地泛起一股激动的情感，她急不可耐地读下去：
    “……你现在已经到了你最理想的地方了。妈妈想念你，可是妈妈更尊重你的理想。你向困难进军的精神鼓舞着你的同学们，他们羡慕你。你走以后，你的同学们常常来打听你，邻居们对我的亲切照顾使我感动。妈妈希望你常给同学们写信，要虚心向你农庄的同志们学习，不断地提高自己。妈妈相信你临走的前几天那个深夜醒来对我说过的话，像你常说的那个“苏联姑姑”那样，把自己宝贵的青春献给祖国最壮丽的事业。我亲爱的女儿，前进吧，妈妈渴望着你能在艰苦的环境里锻炼成一个生产能手——劳动模范！妈妈手笔”
    读完信，她久久地站在那里凝视着远方。小张接过信再读一遍，然后把手搭在小董的肩膀上，轻声地说：
    “真是好妈妈，你在想什么呀，小董？”
    “好妈妈……”小董像是自言自语地重复着。
    然而她自己也说不清楚是什么原因，她的眼睛竟润湿了。从水底泛上来的霞影，使她眼前金光斑烂，那森林，那山峦，那草原上所有的景物，她全看不大清楚了。
