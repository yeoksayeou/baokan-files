Yunnan's Tobacco Leaf Production Increases More Than Fourfold

　　(Our report) Yunnan Province has greatly increased its total production of tobacco leaves this year by more than four times compared to last year, due to the expansion of tobacco fields and the vigorous promotion of high-yield, good-quality, multi-leaf tobacco varieties. In Yuxi Special District, a major production area, the average yield per mu reached 250 jin, with the best reaching over 1,300 jin.

　　Yunnan Province's tobacco leaves were only transferred to six provinces and cities last year, but this year they will be supplied to eighteen provinces and cities, and exported to the Soviet Union and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for the first time. (Zhang Jiechun)

    云南省的烟叶去年只外调到六个省、市，今年将供应给十八个省、市，并第一次向苏联和越南民主共和国出口。　（章皆淳）
