    Xinhua News Agency, December 27th: The National Conference on Cultural Work for Ethnic Minorities, held here, closed this afternoon.
    The conference determined that the guiding principle for cultural work among ethnic minorities in the coming period is: closely coordinate with the political and economic development of all ethnic groups, based on the characteristics and actual conditions of each ethnic group, make comprehensive plans, rational deployments, strengthen leadership, and actively develop cultural work for ethnic minorities, in order to promote the construction and prosperity of socialist national new culture in our country.
    In order to implement the above policy, the conference believes that it is necessary to vigorously support the mass-based, folk amateur cultural and artistic activities of ethnic minorities, actively protect, explore, sort out and promote the cultural heritage of ethnic minorities, and encourage new literary and artistic creation on the basis of improving and enriching national cultural traditions; adopt various methods to train cultural cadres of ethnic minorities; develop cultural exchanges between ethnic groups; actively and systematically develop various cultural undertakings in ethnic minority areas; and it is also necessary to effectively improve and strengthen the leadership of cultural departments at all levels over cultural work in ethnic minority areas, and strive for the close cooperation and support of relevant departments.
    This conference, which opened on December 24th, was the first conference on cultural work for ethnic minorities since the founding of the People's Republic of China. The conference summarized the cultural work in ethnic minority areas. Zhang Zhixiang, Vice Minister of Culture, made a report to the conference on further developing cultural work in ethnic minority areas.
    The conference also criticized the Han chauvinist ideology of insufficient attention to the development of cultural construction in ethnic minority areas on the part of relevant parties, and the subjective and bureaucratic style of leadership that was generally applied. The conference emphasized that resolutely overcoming Han chauvinist ideology and actively training ethnic minority cadres are the keys to further developing cultural work for ethnic minorities.
    Zhang Zhixiang, Vice Minister of Culture, made a summary report before the closing of the conference. He said that the main tasks of cultural work for ethnic minorities in 1957 are to train ethnic minority cadres, strengthen the leadership of cultural work for ethnic minorities, and make plans for the development of ethnic minority cultures according to actual conditions in various places. At the same time, it is necessary to carry out amateur cultural activities for the masses of ethnic minorities. Zhang Zhixiang said: "Carrying out amateur cultural activities for the masses of ethnic minorities is the source for developing cultural undertakings for ethnic minorities, exploring the cultural heritage of ethnic minorities, and creating socialist national new culture. When carrying out these tasks, we must first oppose unreasonable interference and a rude attitude towards the cultural heritage of ethnic minorities." In terms of exploring the cultural heritage of ethnic minorities, he believes that it is first necessary to rescue those valuable heritages that are about to be lost, and that a very cautious attitude must be adopted when processing and sorting them out.
    On the last day of the conference, Sa Kongliao, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, made a report on ethnic policies related to cultural work. Qian Junrui, Acting Minister of Culture, made a report on the current international situation.

    为了贯彻上述方针，会议认为，必须大力扶植少数民族群众的、民间的业余文化艺术活动，积极保护、发掘、整理和发扬少数民族的文化遗产，鼓励在提高和丰富民族文化传统的基础上的新的文艺创作；采取多种多样的办法，培养少数民族文化干部；发展各民族之间的文化交流；积极地有计划地发展少数民族地区的各项文化事业；还必须切实改进和加强各级文化部门对少数民族文化工作的领导，争取有关部门的密切配合和支持。

    这次会议还批判了有关方面对少数民族地区文化建设事业重视不够的大汉族主义思想和领导一般化的主观主义官僚主义的思想作风。会议着重指出，坚决克服大汉族主义思想，积极培养少数民族干部，是进一步发展少数民族文化工作的关键。
    文化部副部长张致祥在大会闭幕前作了总结报告。他说，1957年少数民族文化工作的主要任务是培养少数民族干部，加强对少数民族文化工作的领导，各地根据实际情况作出发展少数民族文化的规划。同时，必须开展少数民族群众的业余的文化活动。张致祥说：“开展少数民族的群众的业余文化活动，是发展少数民族文化事业，发掘少数民族文化遗产和创造社会主义的民族的新文化的泉源。在进行这些工作时，我们首先要反对无理的干涉和对待少数民族文化遗产的粗暴态度。”在发掘少数民族文化遗产方面，他认为首先要抢救那些即将失传的宝贵遗产，而在进行加工整理时，必须采取十分慎重的态度。
