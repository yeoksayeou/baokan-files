　　The Revival of Recitation
　　Qin Mu
    Once, we were having a dinner party in Guangzhou with several writers from Democratic Germany and Czechoslovakia. During the meal, everyone chatted and laughed heartily. Almost all Czechs understand German, so one German translator was enough to convey the meaning to everyone. We talked about customs, food, travel impressions, and then naturally moved on to poetry. When we talked about Goethe and Heine, they were extremely happy. A German male writer and a Czech female writer stood up at the same time and said they wanted to recite a section of Heine's passionate poems for us. As they spoke, they began to recite. At that moment, an interesting and moving scene unfolded: I noticed that the tempo, melody, rhythm, and flavor of their recitation were almost identical. It was truly unbelievable! A man and a woman, one German and one Czech, meeting by chance, could recite a verse of poetry like that so readily and even recite it so harmoniously! At the time, we couldn't help but applaud enthusiastically.
    This incident made me think about how much every nation loves their familiar traditional language! People often recite certain famous works to express their love for their own country or a language they are familiar with. Recitation is a means of education and a method of appreciation.
    A guest from Chile told me that in South America, almost all schoolchildren can recite several chapters of Cervantes' "Don Quixote" in Spanish. Schoolchildren in other countries, as we know, can also recite some famous works in their native languages. Even some nations without writing have preserved some of their national epic poems through oral transmission for generations. This situation is very touching.
    Speaking of recitation, we were all very familiar with this method. Today, every middle-aged person who has dabbled in Chinese literature, who wouldn't be able to recite a few poems from the Book of Songs, Chu Ci, the "Three Officials," "Pipa Ballad," or essays like "Red Cliff Rhapsody" and "Memorial to Ziche"? The things we recited in our youth turned out to be very useful when we grew up! Firmly remembering these representative works allows one to appreciate the commonalities and characteristics of that type of work, and sometimes, in leisurely contemplation, one can even grasp some of the essence of artistic creation. The value of recitation has long been frequently mentioned by the ancients. Otherwise, there wouldn't be sayings like "Read Tang poetry three hundred times, and you'll be able to compose poetry even if you can't already."
    However, after liberation, for a period of time, students almost completely abandoned recitation. Why abandon it? It is said that on the one hand, students had a concept of valuing science and undervaluing literature. On the other hand, some people actually thought that recitation was "reading dead books" and did not dare to insist that students study a certain type of work carefully. As a result, the atmosphere of "loud reading of books" was interrupted for a period.
    In recent years, like many things that should not have been extinguished being resurrected, recitation has also been revived. Now, going to many places, one can hear the sound of reciting again. This revival is naturally a good thing. Because the reason for seeing recitation as reading dead books is not worth refuting. Reciting textbooks without understanding is naturally reading dead books, but reciting on the basis of deep understanding is greatly reading living books. The reason has already been stated. A patriot should love and strive to master the language of their motherland, and the student's concept of valuing science and undervaluing literature should be thoroughly corrected. People who think that Chinese is easy to learn and that natural science is difficult to understand often end up understanding natural science but not being able to write a coherent article in their native language. This tragedy is not uncommon. Underestimating the enemy is a great taboo for military strategists, and not valuing the object of study is also a great taboo for learners. Just think: speaking is not a very difficult thing. Everyone learns to speak by following their mother when they are toddlers rolling around in the mud. However, some people have lived for decades and still haven't spoken well. When they go on stage, they are filled with "this, this" and "that, that" nonsense, making themselves anxious and others bored. It can be seen that learning Chinese is by no means a simple matter.
    The revival of recitation is something to be happy about. The fact that this learning method was once on the verge of death is a lesson worth remembering for many people. The way of thinking of fundamentally negating traditional things lightly based on some one-sided reasons seems to be quite powerful in people's minds. Look: traditional Chinese painting, traditional Chinese medicine, calligraphy, ancient music... and even many historical figures, haven't they all once been greatly unlucky and later gradually restored to their proper position and value? Criticism is not equal to complete negation, and "discarding" is not equal to fundamental abandonment, but one-sided thinking often leads people to simple and wrong paths. The harm of this one-sided thinking is so great that the lesson is worth all people, with the spirit of reciting ancient texts in their youth, repeatedly studying and firmly remembering it.

### 背诵的复活

　　背诵的复活
　　秦牧
    有一次我们同几位民主德国和捷克斯洛伐克的作家在广州便宴，席间大家谈天说地，兴高采烈。捷克斯洛伐克人民几乎全部懂得德文，因此一位德文翻译就尽够给大家传语了。大家谈着风俗、食物、旅行印象，以后就自自然然地谈起了诗。讲到了歌德和海涅，他们高兴极了，一位德国男作家和一位捷克斯洛伐克女作家同时站了起来，说要为我们背诵海涅那些热情的诗篇中的一段，一面讲，一面就背诵起来了。这时马上出现了有趣动人的一幕：我发觉，他们两人背诵音调的疾徐、旋律、节奏、韵味……，几乎是完全一样的。这真使人不容易相信！一男一女，一个是德国人，一个是捷克斯洛伐克人，萍水相逢，说起要背诵某一节诗来就能够这样脱口而出，甚至还能够背诵得这样的合拍！当时，我们不禁都热烈地喝采了。
    这事情使我想起：每一个民族，是多么热爱他们熟悉的传统语文啊！人们常常背诵某些名篇，寄托他们对于本国的或他们所熟悉的某种语文的热爱。背诵，是一种教育的手段，也是一种欣赏的方法。
    一位来自智利的客人告诉我，在南美，几乎所有的学童都会用西班牙文背诵塞万提斯的“堂·吉呵德”的若干章节。其他国家的学童，像我们所熟知的，也各各会用本国语文背诵一些著名的作品。甚至一些没有文字的民族，也用口头传授的方法，世代保存了他们的一些民族叙事诗。这种情形，是十分使人感动的。
    讲起背诵，我们大家本来是很熟悉此道的。今天每一个曾稍涉猎国文的中年人，有那一个不会背诵几篇诗经、楚辞、“三吏”、“琵琶行”或者“赤壁赋”、“陈情表”一类的文章呢？少年时代背诵的这些东西，长大之后觉得用处可真不小！牢牢地记忆了这些代表作，使人可以玩味那一类作品的共性与特性，而且在闲来随时推敲中有时还可以领会一些艺术创作的神髓。背诵的价值古人是早已常常提到了。不然就不会有“熟读唐诗三百首，不会吟诗也会吟”之类的说法。
    但在解放之后，有一段时期，学生们却几乎完全抛弃了背诵。为什么要抛弃呢？据说一方面是学生们有重理轻文的观念。一方面，居然有些人认为背诵是“读死书”，不敢坚持要学生精读某一类作品。结果，“书声琅琅”的风气就有一个时期宣告中断。
    近年来，像好些不应该灭绝的事情死而复活一样，背诵也跟着复活了。现在到许多地方去，又都能听到背书的声音了。这种复活自然是件好事。因为把背诵看做是读死书的理由是不值一驳的。毫无了解地背诵课文自然是读死书，然而在深刻理解的基础上进行的背诵却是大大的读活书，理由刚才已经说过了。一个爱国主义者是应该热爱和努力掌握自己祖国的语文的，学生的重理轻文的观念应该彻底纠正。以为语文容易学习，自然科学才不好懂的人，到头来往往学懂了自然科学，却不能用祖国文字写一篇通顺的文章，这种悲剧是很不少的。轻敌是兵家之大忌，不重视学习对象也就是学习者的大忌。试想想：说话本来并不是很困难的事，每个人做娃娃在泥地上打滚的时候就跟着母亲学说话，然而有些人活了好几十年，话却仍然没有说好，一上讲台去就是“这个这个”“那么那么”的废话连篇，使自己着急，旁人厌倦。可见语文的学习决不是简单的事情了。
    背诵的复活是值得我们高兴的。这种学习方法的一度濒于死亡，那教训则值得很多的人记取。根据一些片面理由，轻率地根本否定了传统事物的那种思想方法，在人们的脑子里似乎是颇有势力的。请看：国画、中医、书法、古乐……以至许许多多的历史人物，不是都曾经一度大大倒霉，后来才逐渐恢复了应有的地位与价值么？批判不等于全部否定，“扬弃”不等于根本抛弃，然而片面性的思想却往往引导人们走上简单的错误的道路。这种片面性思想的为害之烈，那教训是值得所有的人们，以少年时代背诵古文的精神，再四捧诵，把它牢牢记住的。
