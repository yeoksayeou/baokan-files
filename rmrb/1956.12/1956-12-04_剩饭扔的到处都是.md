    Leftover Food Thrown Everywhere
    In the First Tractor Factory's cafeteria, I often see some comrades wasting food. Some people buy a bowl of rice and only eat half or a little more than half of it, then don't eat the rest. Others buy steamed buns but can't finish them, and throw them on the dining hall tables and dormitory windowsills. I even saw a comrade throw an uneaten steamed bun on the ground.
    Wasting food is wrong. I hope the leaders of the Tractor Factory can strengthen publicity and education among the workers on saving food, and I also hope everyone can consciously save food.

    剩饭扔的到处都是
    在第一拖拉机厂的食堂里，我常常看到一些同志糟踏粮食。有的人买一碗饭只吃半碗或小半碗就不吃了，也有的买了馒头吃不完，扔在饭厅桌子上、宿舍窗台上。我还亲眼看见一位同志把吃剩的馒头丢在地上。
    浪费粮食的行为是不对的，我希望拖拉机厂的领导上能对职工们加强节约粮食的宣传教育，同时也希望大家能自觉地节约粮食。
