Czechoslovak Scholars Enthusiastically Study Eastern Issues

In recent years, Czechoslovak scholars have enthusiastically studied Eastern issues. The Oriental Institute of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences is the research center for Oriental studies. It has many well-known Oriental scholars who are highly valued in the scientific community and has four major departments. The largest department is the Far East Department, including Sinology, Japanese studies, Korean studies, Mongolian and Vietnamese studies. Another department includes research work in the Near East region, the third department is Indology, and the fourth department includes research in the Arabic, Turkish, and Iranian regions. There is also a "Gypsy Research Committee". An Egyptology department has not yet been established within the institute, but Czechoslovak universities have researchers in Egyptology.

The library of the Oriental Institute also plays an important cultural and scientific role. The library has a collection of more than 20,000 books on various aspects of Asian studies, and 8,000 people borrowed books from the library this year. In addition, there is a "Lu Xun Library" with a collection of 45,000 books; in Central Europe, this is the largest Sinology library.

The Oriental Institute is also a publishing house. It publishes the famous "Oriental Archives" and the monthly "New Orient".

In addition to research work and teaching activities, Czech Oriental scholars are also collaborating on editing a modern Czech dictionary, with the aim of verifying the etymology of some words that have been transmitted from Eastern languages. Sinologist Průšek became famous for translating Chinese literature, both old and new. In 1953, he published a book "Chinese Literature After Liberation," which analyzed Chinese literature from 1942 to 1950 and explained its relationship with traditional Chinese literature. Another outstanding Sinological work is Klebsová's specialized thesis on Lu Xun. This book was published in France in 1953. Professor Tauer's works are in the field of Islamic history. He has also done some translation work, and the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences published his translation of "One Thousand and One Nights" last year. Dr. Poppe was the first expert to study Mongolia, and last year he published a translation of "The Secret History of the Mongols" with detailed annotations.

　　捷学者热心研究东方问题
    近年来捷克斯洛伐克学者热心研究东方问题。捷克斯洛伐克科学院的东方研究所，是东方学的研究中心，它拥有许多知名的深受科学界重视的东方学者，设有四大学部。最大的一部是远东学部，包括汉学、日本学、朝鲜研究、蒙古和越南研究。另一学部包括近东地区的研究工作，第三学部是印度学，第四学部包括阿拉伯、土耳其和伊朗地区的研究。另外还有一个“吉普赛研究委员会”。在研究所内还未设立埃及学部，但在捷克斯洛伐克的大学内则拥有埃及学的研究者。
    东方研究所的图书馆也起着重要的文化和科学作用。该馆收藏有关亚洲研究各方面的图书在两万册以上，今年向该馆借书的就有八千人。此外，还设立有“鲁迅图书馆”，藏书四万五千册；在中欧方面，这是最大的汉学图书馆。
    东方研究所也是一个出版机关。它刊行了有名的“东方档案”和“新东方”月刊。
    捷东方学者除了研究工作和教学活动之外，还正在合作编辑一部现代捷克语文词典，目的在于考证一些从东方语文中传过去的字源。汉学家布鲁西克以翻译中国新旧文学而成名，他在1953年出版了一本“解放后的中国文学”的著作，分析了1942至1950年这一时期的中国文学，并解释了它和传统中国文学的关系。另一种杰出的汉学著作，是克列布索娃的有关鲁迅的专门论文。这本书是1953年在法国出版的。著名学者铎尔教授的著作是在伊斯兰历史方面。他也做过一些翻译工作，去年捷科学院出版了他翻译的“天方夜谭”。波查博士是研究蒙古的第一个专家，去年他出版了“蒙古人秘密纪年史”的译文，并加以详细的注解。
