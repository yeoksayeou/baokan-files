Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd: Three million on-the-job young people with at least a junior high school education across the country are actively marching towards science, and many young people have already achieved results in this endeavor.

Many on-the-job young people enthusiastically participate in various amateur study groups to learn science and culture. Young people in many factories and mines have also organized amateur technical research groups to study various technologies. Many young people have also carefully developed plans for amateur study in science and technology, theoretical culture, and other areas. Currently, about 80% of young teachers in schools have made plans, about 60% of young technicians and workers in factories and mines have made plans, and about 50% of young people in government offices have made plans.

Many young people who have developed study plans and participate in amateur study groups are able to seize their spare time and diligently persist in their studies. They overcome difficulties such as a lack of books, tutoring, classrooms, and lighting, and persevere in their studies. The young people of the 702 Electrical Measurement Team working in the Minle Basin of the Yumen Oilfield organized two cultural classes. When they didn't have textbooks, they compiled their own lecture notes. When there was no electricity at night, they gathered around candles to read, and they persisted in their studies. The young people of the Trial Oil Brigade of the Oil Production Plant did not have a classroom, so they held classes in the open air, and very few people were absent. Some young people in government offices in Guizhou Province have rationally arranged their spare time, and most of them are able to consistently devote an average of eight hours per week to amateur study. In the upsurge of marching towards science, many young people who were previously playful and did not study hard have now changed. They actively revise their plans and voluntarily participate in learning.

On-the-job young people who are able to persist in their studies have gradually improved their cultural and scientific level and their work ability. Many young technicians in factories and mines have put forward rationalization proposals for improving technology after studying in conjunction with their work. A young scientific research group of the Northwest Second Construction Engineering Company researched and developed a method of using lime cinder flooring instead of cement flooring in their work area. According to preliminary statistics, after using this method for part of the flooring, it can save the state cement worth 6,000 yuan. Many young people working in government offices have also quickly become familiar with their work and improved their work efficiency through amateur study. Ding Baozhen, a young woman who works at the Baoding City branch of the Construction Bank, used to do clerical work. Because she persisted in studying, she had basically learned the principles of financial accounting within three months, and now she is able to independently conduct financial budget reviews. Zhang Junxue, a typist at the Tax Bureau of this city, has increased her typing speed from 1,300 characters per hour to 1,600 characters per hour after amateur study.

Party, League, trade union, and administrative leaders in many places have paid attention to actively helping young people create conditions for learning and solving difficulties in their studies, but currently, the leaders of many units have not paid attention to guiding and supporting young people in their march towards science. There are also many problems in the march towards science by young people in various places. Some young people's study plans are not realistic, and some young people lack confidence in their studies and cannot persist well.

　　掌握科学技术　精通业务工作
　　全国三百万在职青年积极向科学进军
    新华社3日讯　全国三百万具有初中以上文化程度的在职知识青年正在积极向科学进军，有许多青年在向科学进军中已经获得了成绩。
    很多在职知识青年热情地参加了各种业余学习组织，学习科学和文化。不少厂矿单位的青年还组织了业余技术研究小组，研究各种技术。许多青年还认真地制定了学习科学技术、理论文化等方面的业余进修规划。目前，在学校中约有80％以上的青年教师订了规划，厂矿企业的青年技术人员和职工中约有60％左右订了规划，机关青年订规划的约占50％。
    许多制定进修规划和参加业余学习组织的青年都能抓紧业余时间刻苦认真地坚持学习。他们克服缺乏图书资料、辅导、教室、灯光等困难，坚持了学习。在玉门油矿民乐盆地工作的七○二电测队的青年，组织了两个文化班学习，他们没有课本就自己编讲义，晚上没有电灯，大家就围着蜡烛看书，一直坚持学习。采油厂试油大队的青年没有教室，他们便在露天地上课，很少有人缺课。贵州省一些机关青年合理地安排了业余时间，他们大都能每星期平均坚持八小时的业余学习。在向科学进军的热潮中，有不少过去贪玩不努力学习的青年，现在转变了，他们积极修订规划，自动地参加学习。
    能够坚持学习的在职知识青年，都逐步提高了文化科学水平和工作能力。不少厂矿的青年技术人员结合工作进行学习后，提出了改进技术的合理化建议。西北第二建筑工程公司一个青年科学研究小组，研究出在本工区采用以石灰煤渣地坪代替水泥地坪的办法，据初步统计，部分地坪采用这种方法后，可以为国家节约价值六千元的水泥。许多在机关工作的青年通过业余学习，也很快熟悉了业务，提高了工作效率。在保定市的建设银行分行服务的青年丁宝珍，原来是作缮写工作的，由于她坚持学习，在三个月内已经基本上学会了财务会计原理，现在她已能独立作财务预算审查工作。这个市的税务局打字员张俊雪经过业余学习后，由原来每小时打一千三百字提高到一千六百字。
    许多地方的党、团、工会和行政领导方面，都注意到积极帮助青年创造学习的条件和解决学习中的困难，但是目前还有不少单位的领导方面没有重视指导和支持青年向科学进军。各地青年在向科学进军中也还存在不少问题，有些青年的学习规划订得不切合实际，有些青年在学习中缺乏信心，不能很好地坚持下去。
