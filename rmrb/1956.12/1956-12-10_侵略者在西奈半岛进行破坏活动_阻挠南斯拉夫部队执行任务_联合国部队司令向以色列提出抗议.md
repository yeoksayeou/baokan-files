Xinhua News Agency, December 9th: According to a Yugoslav News Agency report from Cairo on December 8th: Colonel Radovan Vojuodic, the Yugoslav representative to the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) Command, has once again protested to UNEF Commander General Burns regarding the difficulties encountered by Yugoslav troops in carrying out their mission in the Sinai Peninsula.

It is understood that Burns immediately protested to the Israeli government regarding Israeli aircraft flying over Yugoslav troops in the Sinai. In another dispatch, the Yugoslav News Agency stated that Yugoslav troops entering the Sinai Peninsula have encountered damaged transportation routes and numerous minefields. Cairo received this news with particular unease: Israeli aircraft of French manufacture flew over the positions of Yugoslav troops and, as these troops moved, made low-altitude flybys; in some locations, the British organized the surveillance of Yugoslav troops.

The Yugoslav News Agency said that Cairo is rightly questioning the purpose of the Israeli and British authorities in taking such actions. Political figures believe this is in direct opposition to the UNEF and the tasks entrusted to these forces. Cairo was also surprised to receive General Burns' decision that Egyptian civilians are not allowed to participate in the clearing and repair of bombed roads in the Sinai Desert.

    侵略者在西奈半岛进行破坏活动
　　阻挠南斯拉夫部队执行任务
　  联合国部队司令向以色列提出抗议
    据新华社9日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社开罗8日讯：联合国紧急部队司令部的南斯拉夫代表腊多万·沃尤奥迪奇上校对于南斯拉夫部队在西奈半岛执行它们的任务时所遭到的困难，再一次向联合国紧急部队司令伯恩斯将军提出了抗议。
    据了解，伯恩斯对于以色列飞机在西奈在南斯拉夫部队上空飞行一事立即向以色列政府提出了抗议。南斯拉夫通讯社在另一篇消息中说，进入西奈半岛的南斯拉夫部队已经遇到交通被破坏的情况和许多的地雷区。开罗以特别不安的心情接到这种消息：法国造的以色列飞机飞越南斯拉夫部队阵地的上空，并且在这些部队移动时，低空疾飞；英国在一些地方组织了对南斯拉夫部队的跟踪。
    南斯拉夫通讯社说，开罗方面正当地质问以色列和英国当局采取这种行动的目的何在。政界人士认为，这是直接反对联合国紧急部队和委托给这些部队的任务。开罗接到伯恩斯将军的决定时也觉得很奇怪，根据这一决定，不准埃及平民参加西奈沙漠被炸毁的公路的清理和修补工作。
