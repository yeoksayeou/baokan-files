    Xinhua News Agency, Amman, 21st: The "Falastin" newspaper reported on the 20th that Jordanian Prime Minister Nabulsi said when meeting with reporters from the newspaper that the Jordanian government will immediately negotiate with Britain to end the British-Jordanian treaty after concluding a financial aid agreement with Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia and implementing the agreement.
    Nabulsi said: "The government is eager for Arab financial assistance, which will guarantee the elimination of all traces of foreign forces in Jordan in the fastest way possible, including all treaties, agreements, and air bases."
    Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia have expressed their agreement to provide Jordan with financial assistance to replace the 12 million pounds of British financial subsidies to Jordan annually, enabling Jordan to abolish the servile Anglo-Jordanian treaty.
    Nabulsi said that a delegation will be sent to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria at the beginning of next month to negotiate financial assistance issues.
    Jordanian Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Bahaeddin Toukan, will return to Amman today to discuss the issue of ending the Anglo-Jordanian treaty.

    约旦首相重申在取得埃叙沙财政援助后
    将废除奴役性的英约条约
    新华社21日讯　安曼消息：“巴勒斯坦报”20日报道，约旦首相纳布西在接见这家报纸的记者时说，约旦政府在同埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯缔结了一项财政援助协定并且把这项协定付诸实施以后，将立即同英国交涉结束英国—约旦条约。
    纳布西说：“政府渴望阿拉伯的财政援助，这一援助将保证以最迅速的方法消除约旦国内外国势力的一切痕迹，包括一切条约、协定和空军基地。”
    埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯三国曾经表示同意给约旦财政援助，来代替英国给约旦的每年一千二百万英镑的财政补贴，使约旦能废除奴役性的英—约条约。
    纳布西说，下月初将派一个代表团到埃及、沙特阿拉伯和叙利亚去谈判财政援助问题。
    约旦驻英国大使巴哈埃丁·图康将在今天回到安曼，商议有关结束英—约条约问题。
