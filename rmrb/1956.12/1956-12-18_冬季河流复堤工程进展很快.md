Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: The winter river embankment restoration projects across the country are progressing significantly. In some areas, the embankment repair work has been completed ahead of schedule.

This year, many rivers have large-scale embankment restoration projects. In Hebei Province, which suffered severe flooding, the embankment restoration project plans to move 20 million cubic meters of earthwork this winter. Currently, the restoration of embankments along the Zhang River, Wei River, Ziya River, Daqing River, and Hutuo River has been basically completed. All repaired embankments have largely been restored to their original state; in some dangerous sections, they have been raised by half a meter above the original standard, with the top width increased to six to seven meters, and the weak parts of the embankments have also been strengthened. This winter, the earthwork for the embankment restoration of the main stream of the Huai River and the Hong River and Ru River in Henan Province will also reach more than 17 million cubic meters, of which more than 12 million cubic meters have already been completed. In Huai Bin County, the main dike of the Huai River used to be severely threatened by floods. Now, this section of the embankment has been raised by one meter on the original basis.

The embankment repair work on the main stream of the middle reaches of the Huai River and the Ying River is also actively underway, with more than 100,000 people working daily. By the end of November, this project had completed more than 800,000 cubic meters of earthwork.

The embankment restoration projects of the Songhua River, Lalin River, and Hulan River in Heilongjiang Province and the Second Songhua River in Jilin Province have been suspended due to ice and snow, but several million cubic meters of earthwork have been completed. The repair work of river dikes, sea dikes, and important river embankments in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has also begun successively. Zhejiang Province also strictly requires that all repaired dike projects must meet the standards of resisting the failure of a level 10 typhoon and avoiding risks at the specified guaranteed water level flow rate.

    冬季河流复堤工程进展很快
    新华社16日讯　全国各地冬季河流复堤工程有很大进展。有些地区的堤岸整修工作已经提前完成。
    今年有不少河流，复堤工程规模很大。在遭受严重水灾的河北省，复堤工程计划在今年冬季要做二千万土方。现在，漳河，卫河、子牙河、大清河、滹沱河等河流，已经基本完成了堤岸的修复工作。所有经过整修的堤岸，大部恢复了原状；在有些险要地段，还在原有的标准上加高了半公尺，顶宽增加到六公尺到七公尺，堤岸薄弱的部分也都加强了。今年冬季，淮河干流和河南省洪河、汝河等河流的复堤土方也要达到一千七百多万公方，现在已经完成了一千二百多万土方。在淮滨县境内，淮河干堤过去受洪水威胁比较严重。现在，这段河堤在原有基础上加高了一公尺。
    淮河中游干堤和颍河堤岸整修工作也正在积极进行，每天上工的人数有十多万人。到11月底，这项工程已完成了八十多万土方。
    黑龙江省的松花江、拉林河、呼兰河和吉林省的第二松花江的复堤工程，因为冰雪封冻，已经停工，但是完成的土方也已有几百万公方。江苏、浙江两省的江堤、海堤和重要河流的堤防整修工作也已经陆续开始。浙江省还严格要求凡经整修的堤防工程要达到抗御十级台风不溃决和在规定保证水位流量不出险的标准。
