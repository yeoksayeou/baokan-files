Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 3rd. Scientists from the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have conducted a series of experiments and research on the smelting of Baotou iron ore for the past three years, providing valuable reference materials for the design of the Baotou Iron and Steel Base.

The extremely rich Baotou iron ore contains a considerable amount of calcium fluoride (fluorite). Preliminary tests by China's industrial departments have proved that the presence of fluorine makes the furnace charge easier to descend, thus increasing the production of pig iron. At the same time, the pig iron smelted from this type of iron ore contains very little sulfur and silicon, making it an excellent raw material for steelmaking. However, the corrosive effect of fluorine is significant, and the presence of fluorine in the iron ore causes many problems in smelting. Zhou Ren, Director of the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics, a well-known metallurgist in his sixties, metallurgist Zou Yuanxi, and other scientists and staff of the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics, conducted detailed research on these problems. Initially, the research was conducted in the laboratory; since the beginning of this year, the metallurgists have used a newly built small blast furnace in the institute for further smelting experiments and research. According to them, this type of fluorine-containing iron ore is extremely rare among the world's discovered mineral deposits. In the history of ironmaking, no scientist has ever studied it before. How much corrosive power does the fluorine contained in the blast furnace gas have on the blast furnace? This is the central question of the research. The scientists made important improvements to the gas sampling and dust removal methods and found that the limestone in the furnace can rapidly absorb the fluorine in the gas, so that very little fluorine actually volatilizes in the furnace. They therefore speculated that the erosion of the metal structure and refractory materials of the blast furnace by the fluorine in the blast furnace gas would be relatively minor. The results of the inspection of the steel sheets that had been hanging in the furnace since the start of the furnace, as well as the refractory materials taken from the furnace body, confirmed the above view.

Relevant production departments had raised the concern that fluorine-containing gas is not easy to burn, and if this situation cannot be changed, the blast furnace will not be able to work. After research, the metallurgists found that by using a good washing and dust removal system to remove the furnace dust carried in the gas, the gas burns very well and can be used for hot air. They also proved that due to the defluorination effect of the furnace dust itself, the fluorine content in the blast furnace gas washing water is far lower than imagined. This water can be recycled without causing fluorine accumulation problems. The corrosive force of this fluorine-containing washing water on the washing tower and pipelines is also very small, and it will not have a serious impact on the surrounding environmental hygiene. In Anshan, larger-scale smelting tests of Baotou iron ore based on these opinions have yielded the same results.

Therefore, the metallurgists concluded that the presence of fluorine in Baotou iron ore is not as terrible as previously estimated. The presence of fluorine is beneficial to the production and quality of pig iron, but its disadvantages are not significant and can be avoided.

The scientists at the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics have also achieved significant results in the study of other important issues in the smelting of Baotou iron ore.

    我国冶金学家对包钢基地的重大贡献
　　研究使用含氟铁矿石获得结果
    新华社上海3日电　中国科学院冶金陶瓷研究所的科学家们，三年来就包头铁矿的冶炼问题进行了一系列的试验与研究，为包头钢铁基地的设计提供了有价值的参考资料。
    蕴藏量极其丰富的包头铁矿中，含有相当数量的氟化钙（莹石）。我国产业部门的初步试验证明，氟的存在，使炉料容易下降，因而能增加生铁的产量；同时这类铁矿炼出来的生铁含硫和硅很少，是很好的炼钢原料。但是，氟的腐蚀作用是很大的，铁矿中氟的存在在冶炼上引起了很多问题。冶金陶瓷研究所所长、六十多岁的著名冶金学家周仁，冶金学家邹元燨和冶金陶瓷研究所其他的科学家和工作人员们，对这些问题进行了详细的研究。开始，研究工作是在实验室内进行的；今年年初以来，冶金学家们又利用研究所内新建的一个小型高炉作了进一步的冶炼试验研究。据他们说，这类含氟的铁矿是世界上已发现的矿藏中极少见的。在炼铁史上，过去还没有科学家研究过它。高炉煤气中所含的氟，对高炉的侵蚀力量究竟有多大？这是研究的中心问题。科学家们对煤气的取样及除尘方法作了重要的改进，发现炉中石灰石能够迅速地吸收煤气中的氟，使得氟在炉内实际上挥发得很少。他们因而推测，高炉煤气中的氟对高炉的金属结构和耐火材料的侵蚀将是比较次要的。从开炉期间始终挂在炉内的钢片，以及从炉身取下的耐火材料进行检查的结果，都证实了以上的看法。
    有关生产部门曾提出，含氟煤气不容易燃烧，如果不能改变这种情况，将使高炉无法工作。冶金学家们经过研究，发现利用良好的洗涤与除尘系统，将煤气中所带的炉尘除去，煤气就燃烧得很好，可以作为热风之用。他们还证明，由于炉尘本身的去氟作用，高炉煤气的洗涤水中所含的氟远不如想像的那样高，这种水可以循环使用，而不致发生氟的积累问题。这种含氟很少的洗涤水对洗涤塔和管道的侵蚀力也是很小的，对周围环境卫生也不会发生严重影响。在鞍山，根据这些意见进行的更大规模的包头铁矿冶炼试验，得出了相同的结果。
    因此，冶金学家们得出结论说：包头铁矿中含有氟，并不如过去估计的那样可怕。氟的存在对生铁的产量和质量有好处，它的坏处却并不显著，而且是可以避免的。
    冶金陶瓷研究所的科学家们，对包头铁矿冶炼中的其他一些重要问题的研究，也获得了显著的成果。
