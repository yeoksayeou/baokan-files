    Using Wood Scraps to Make Table Tops
    The Jilin City Woodworking Factory, a locally-run state enterprise, has successfully researched the use of wood scraps to make table tops. In November, they produced the first batch of 464 three-drawer tables, which have already been sold in the market.
    These table tops can bear a weight of over 400 jin without cracking or breaking, and the cost of each is 8 jiao and 6 fen lower than that of ordinary table tops.
    This factory sells over 10 million jin of waste material to its employees as firewood every year. They plan to use machines next year to cut these waste materials into small pieces and produce 30,600 various table tops. It is estimated that this can save more than 70,000 yuan and save the country more than 1,000 cubic meters of logs.

    碎木料做桌面
    地方国营吉林市木器工厂，研究用碎木料制桌面成功，11月份首批生产出四百六十四张三匣桌，已销售到市场去了。
    这种桌面，可以担负四百多斤的重量不裂不坏，每张比普通桌面的成本低八角六分钱。
    这个厂每年有一千多万斤废料当薪柴卖给职工。他们计划明年用机器把这些废料截成小料，生产三万零六百张各种桌面，预计可以节省七万多元，还能给国家节约一千多立方公尺的原木。
