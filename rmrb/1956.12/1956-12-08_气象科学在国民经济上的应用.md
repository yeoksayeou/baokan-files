    The Application of Meteorological Science in the National Economy
　　Director of the Central Meteorological Bureau, Tu Changwang
    Humans live within the atmosphere. Every aspect of human activity, including all kinds of national economic activities, is affected to varying degrees by the changes occurring within the atmosphere. Meteorology is the science that studies the various physical changes that occur in the atmosphere. Studying these changes so that various national economic departments can maximize their beneficial aspects and avoid their harmful aspects is one of the primary tasks of meteorological science.
    The most significant is the forecasting and warning of disastrous weather. For example, before the invasion of cold waves in winter, and before typhoons strike coastal areas in summer and autumn, meteorological agencies issue timely warnings so that relevant departments can quickly take measures to reduce losses. After several years of effort, the paths and intensities of typhoons that strike our country, as well as the movement of larger cold waves, have been largely mastered, and warnings are now issued twenty-four hours in advance. This has played a certain role in preventing and mitigating disasters.
    Secondly, as everyone knows, is the general weather forecasting work, which has a greater impact on national economic departments that produce outdoors. For example, our country's existing sea salt industry relies entirely on natural evaporation for outdoor production. A rainstorm not only makes production impossible, but also the finished salt stored outdoors and the semi-finished brine still in the ponds may be reduced to nothing. Although our country's current level of meteorological science cannot completely and accurately report general weather changes, our country's meteorological agencies have undertaken the task of supplying weather forecasts to salt fields along the coast of the country in a timely manner. Some areas can even supply medium-term forecasts of three to five days, which plays a certain guiding role in the arrangement of sea salt production. For example, our country still has a large number of fishing boats and wooden sailing boats with backward equipment and small tonnage. When operating in the ocean and large lakes, serious accidents may occur if they encounter slightly larger winds and waves. In recent years, although our country's gale forecasting and warning work has not completely eliminated accidents, the loss of life and property has been reduced year by year.
    In addition to reporting future weather changes in advance, another service that meteorological departments provide to national economic departments extensively is the supply of climate data. The planning and construction of industry, agriculture, transportation, postal and telecommunications, and commerce (mainly commodity storage) all need to consider the climatic conditions of the relevant areas. For example, the construction of a high-voltage power line requires obtaining wind force data and wire icing conditions in the areas it passes through in order to consider the pressure borne by the power line steel towers and design accordingly. The construction of various factory buildings and grain warehouses also requires data on air temperature, humidity, wind direction, wind force, etc., in order to improve construction quality and ensure scientific use after completion. Due to the extreme backwardness of meteorological work in our country before liberation, the data left behind were sparsely distributed, of short duration, and inaccurate. After the liberation of the whole country, our country vigorously promoted the construction of meteorological stations. Although the defect of short recording periods cannot be made up for in a short time, a relatively dense observation network has been basically established, except in areas where transportation and living conditions are extremely difficult, and the quality of observations has also been greatly improved. A batch of reliable data has begun to be accumulated for use by national economic departments.
    What has been mentioned above is only the general service of meteorological science to various national economic departments. Meteorological science and some national economic departments have particularly close relationships, with many specialized applications. Meteorological science itself has various branches due to these specialized applications and specialized research objects. The more important ones include aviation meteorology, hydrometeorology, agricultural meteorology, applied climatology, and so on.
    Accurately grasping meteorological conditions plays a key role in flight safety. From takeoff to landing, and even when parked at the airport, airplanes are affected by meteorological conditions at all times. Strong crosswinds can cause the plane to deviate from the runway and roll over during takeoff or landing. Low clouds, rain, fog, dust, etc., can reduce visibility, causing the plane to get lost or even crash into obstacles. Other phenomena such as icing, turbulence, and lightning in the air also have serious impacts on flight safety. Modern flight technology has made great progress, and the application of radar and other electronic instruments has greatly reduced the difficulty of flying in adverse weather conditions. The application of jet technology and high-pressure airtight technology has greatly increased flight speed and altitude, and has also reduced the threat of weather changes to flight. But this does not mean that the role of aviation meteorology will be greatly reduced, only that the nature of the problem has changed somewhat. Still taking the high-altitude flight of jet aircraft as an example: because the wind speed is generally very high at high altitudes close to the stratosphere. In the westerly jet stream region, wind speeds of more than 100 kilometers per hour are very common. How to choose a flight path with the maximum tailwind and the minimum headwind has great significance for jet aircraft that consume a large amount of fuel. At present, our country has specialized meteorological forecasting stations at every major civil aviation airport, and has also established many types of meteorological stations and high-altitude stations on various routes to provide the information required for civil aviation transportation. In recent years, the meteorological aspects have guaranteed the safety of increasingly frequent civil aviation flights and provided the main basis for flight scheduling and route selection.
    Our country's comprehensive large-scale water conservancy hubs are increasing day by day. How to scientifically operate reservoirs? When to open and close the gates? How to allocate the amount of water for power generation, irrigation, and shipping? To solve this series of problems, we must first know the future rainfall situation, the flow and accumulation of rainwater after it falls, and the amount of evaporation. This is one of the main tasks of hydrometeorology. Without this work, it is possible that excessive water release in advance during long-term droughts will cause the reservoir to dry up, and power generation, shipping, and irrigation will be hindered. Conversely, it is also possible that the reservoir cannot be evacuated in time before the arrival of floods caused by heavy rains or melting snow, so that the flood cannot be discharged, and water disasters will still occur even if the reservoir is built. Hydrometeorology has not yet truly grown up in our country, but the application of meteorological work in water conservancy has also achieved considerable results. In August 1953, there was continuous overcast and rainy weather in northern Jiangsu. The water conservancy department prepared to open the Luoma Lake depression for flood storage, but because the meteorological forecast indicated that the overcast and rainy weather would stop soon, a decision was made to postpone water storage. As a result, the forecast was correct, and more than 300,000 mu of crops in the flood storage area were saved. This is a clear example of the application of meteorological work to water conservancy.
    The relationship between agriculture and meteorology is even closer. Because the regional characteristics of agriculture are very obvious and there are many types and varieties of crops, the application of meteorological science in agriculture has become an extremely complex and meticulous task. To study the relationship between crops and meteorological conditions, it is necessary not only to understand large-scale meteorological conditions, but also to further understand the conditions close to the ground surface and the surface of crops. Therefore, agricultural meteorology in some aspects includes macro-meteorology, microclimatology or microclimatology, local climatology and other fields, and also requires the measurement and analysis of the meteorological and hydrological characteristics of the soil. Our country is currently actively preparing to build an agricultural meteorological station network in order to accumulate data and conduct research, so that in the near future we will be able to grasp the relationship between crops and meteorological conditions in various regions and provide the meteorological science basis required for increased production measures such as variety selection, improved cultivation systems and technologies. At present, the more significant role of meteorological work in agriculture, in addition to general disastrous weather forecasting and warnings, is frost forecasting. This work has become the basis for farmers in vast areas of northern China to carry out frost prevention struggles.
    The scope of applied climatology is very wide, mainly applied in urban planning and industrial construction. Urban planning must consider the local prevailing wind direction so that buildings that are harmful to sanitary conditions are placed on the leeward side. The strength of various building structures must also consider the pressure caused by wind speed. Some modern workshops with particularly high requirements need to work under constant temperature or humidity conditions. If they are built in places where temperature and humidity vary greatly from day to day and from year to year, it will inevitably greatly increase the cost of artificially maintaining constant temperature and humidity, increase product costs, and even prevent the product from maintaining quality.
    In addition to being applied to other national economic departments, meteorological science itself has rich resources that need to be developed and utilized. The most important of these are wind energy and solar radiation energy. Our country has extremely rich wind energy reserves, especially in the northwest region, which has great development prospects. Utilizing wind energy for power generation and irrigation in areas with inconvenient transportation is of particular importance. Our country is one of the countries in the world with the most available solar radiation energy. The Soviet Union has made outstanding achievements in utilizing solar energy. We should intensify our efforts to learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience in this area. In addition, artificial control of clouds and rain and climate modification have great significance for the development of the national economy. In this regard, we need to absorb the advanced technologies of various countries around the world, combine them with our country's natural conditions, and actively conduct research.
    Meteorological science plays a great role in the development of various national economies, but the development of meteorological science itself depends more on other national economic departments. The construction of transportation and postal and telecommunications plays a decisive role in the development of the meteorological station network. The radio industry is the foundation for high-altitude observation instruments and electronic computers needed for more accurate weather forecasts. Jet technology and the peaceful use of atomic energy provide new possibilities for the exploration of the upper atmosphere and the study of atmospheric circulation. With the completion of our country's industrial system and the progress of other related sciences, our country's meteorological cause will be able to further serve the great construction of the motherland.

    气象科学在国民经济上的应用
　　中央气象局局长　涂长望
    人类生存在大气圈中。人类活动的各个方面，包括各种国民经济活动，都会在不同程度上受到大气圈里所产生的变化的影响。气象学是研究大气圈里所产生的各种物理变化的科学。对于这些变化进行研究，使各国民经济部门能最大限度地利用其有利的一面，避免其有害的一面，是气象科学的主要任务之一。
    最显著的是灾害性天气的预报和警报工作。例如，冬季在寒潮入侵之前，夏、秋季沿海地区在台风袭击之前，气象机构及时发出警报，使有关部门能迅速采取措施，减少损失。经过几年来的努力，对侵袭我国的台风的路径和强度，较大寒潮的移动，现已能大体上掌握，并在二十四小时以前发布警报。在防止和减轻灾害方面起了一定的作用。
    其次是大家所熟知的就是一般的天气预报工作，它对于在露天生产的国民经济部门作用较大。例如我国现有的海盐业，全部利用自然蒸发在露天进行生产，一场暴雨不仅使生产无法进行，而且露天储存的制成品盐斤和还在池中的半制成品卤水，也可能化为乌有。虽然我国目前气象科学水平还不能完全准确地报出一般的天气变化，但我国气象机构已负起及时向全国沿海各盐场供应天气预报的任务，部分地区且能供应三、五天的中期预报，对海盐生产的安排起了一定的指导作用。又如我国目前仍有一批数目很大的设备落后、吨位很小的渔船和木帆船，在海洋和大湖中作业时，遇有稍大的风浪，即可能发生严重事故。几年来我国的大风预报、警报工作，虽还不能完全消灭事故，但生命财产的损失已逐年减少。
    除了预先报告未来的天气变化以外，气象部门的另一项对国民经济部门广泛服务的工作，就是气候资料的供应。无论工业、农业、运输邮电业及商业（主要是商品保管储存）的规划和建设，都需考虑有关地区的气候条件。例如建设一条高压电力线，就需要获得所经地区的风力资料及电线挂冰情况，以考虑架线钢塔所承受的压力而进行设计；各种厂房、粮食仓库的建设，也需得到空气温度、湿度、风向、风力等项资料，才能达到提高建设质量和建成后科学地使用的目的。由于解放前我国气象工作非常落后，所遗留下来的资料，地点分布稀疏、年代短、准确性差。在全国解放以后，我国就大力进行气象站的建设工作，虽然纪录年代短的缺陷一时无法弥补，但除交通和生活条件万分困难的地区以外，一个较稠密的观测网已基本上建设起来，观测的质量也大为提高，已经开始积累了一批可靠的资料供应国民经济部门使用。
    以上所谈到的，只是气象科学对国民经济各部门一般性的服务。气象科学和某些国民经济部门还有特殊密切关系，有很多专门性的应用。甚至气象科学本身也因为这些专门应用和专门的研究对象而有各种不同的分枝。其中较主要的如航空气象学、水文气象学、农业气象学、应用气候学，等等。
    准确地掌握气象条件，对飞行的安全起着关键性的作用。飞机从起飞到着陆，甚至停放在飞机场上，无时无刻不受到气象条件的影响。较强烈的侧风会使飞机起飞或着陆时偏离跑道而滚翻失事。低云、雨、雾、尘等能使视程降低，致使飞机迷航甚至撞到障碍物上；其他如空中积冰、颠簸、雷电等现象，对飞行的安全都有严重影响。近代飞行技术有了很大进展，雷达及其他电子仪器的应用，大大地减少了在恶劣天气中飞行的困难；喷气技术与高压密闭技术的应用，使飞行速度和高度大大提高，也减少了天气变化对飞行的威胁。但这不等于说航空气象学的作用将大为减低，只是问题的性质起了一些变化。仍以喷气飞机高空飞行为例：因为在接近平流层的高空，风速一般很大，在西风急流区域里，每小时一百公里以上的风速是很平常的现象。如何选择最大顺风和最小逆风的飞行路径，对于大量消耗燃料的喷气飞机来说，具有极大的意义。我国目前在每一个较大的民航机场都设有专门的气象预报台，在各航线上也设立了很多各种类型的气象站及高空站，以供应民航运输所需的情报。几年来在气象方面保证了日益频繁的民航飞行的安全，对飞行的调度和航线的选择提供了主要的依据。
    我国综合性的大型水利枢纽日益增加。如何科学地运用水库，何时启闸、关闸？发电、灌溉、航运各分配水量多少？这一系列问题的解决，首先要知道未来的下雨情况、雨水下降后的流动和汇集情况，以及蒸发量的大小等。这就是水文气象学的主要任务之一。缺乏这方面的工作，则可能在长期干旱时因事先放水过多，致使水库干涸，发电、航运、灌溉均受阻碍；反过来也可能在暴雨或溶雪所造成的洪水到来之前，未能及时预见而事先腾出容积，以致洪水不能宣泄，水库建筑好了也仍然会闹水灾。水文气象学在我国还没有真正成长起来，但是气象工作在水利上的应用也取得了相当的成果。1953年8月份江苏北部连续阴雨，水利部门准备开放骆马湖洼地蓄洪工程，但由于气象预报阴雨不久即可停止，因而作出决定暂缓蓄水，结果预报正确，挽救了蓄洪区的三十多万亩庄稼。这就是气象工作应用到水利上的一个显明事例。
    农业和气象的关系更为密切。由于农业的地域性特征很明显而各种作物的种类和品种众多，气象科学在农业上的运用就成为一种异常复杂和细致的工作。要研究农作物和气象条件的关系，不但需要了解大范围的气象条件，而且要进一步了解贴近地表面和农作物表面的情况。所以农业气象学在某些方面包括了宏观气象学、小气候学或微观气候学、地方气候学等领域，而且还需对土壤的气象和水文特性进行测定和分析。我国目前正在积极准备力量，建设农业气象站网，以便积累资料，进行研究，在不久的将来使我们能够掌握各地区农作物和气象条件的关系，提供品种选择、改良耕作制度和技术等方面的增产措施所需的气象科学上的根据。目前气象工作在农业上较显著的作用，除一般灾害性天气预报、警报以外，还有霜冻预报。这项工作已成为我国北部广大地区的农民群众进行防霜斗争的依据。
    应用气候学的范围很广，主要应用在城市规划和工业建设中。城市规划必须考虑当地的最多风向，以使有害于卫生条件的建筑物放在下风面。各种建筑结构的强度也必须考虑风速所造成的压力。某些的近代化的要求特高车间，需在恒温或恒湿的条件下工作。如果建设在温度和湿度日变化和年变化很大的地点，势必大大地增高人工维持恒温、恒湿的费用，使产品成本提高，甚至不能保持产品质量。
    气象科学除了应用于其他国民经济部门外，本身还存在着丰富的资源，有待我们开发利用。其中最主要的是风能和太阳辐射能。我国蕴藏着极其丰富的风能，尤其是在西北地区，很有开发前途。在交通不便地区利用风能发电和灌溉有特殊重要的意义。我国是世界上拥有最多可利用的太阳辐射能的国家之一。苏联在利用太阳能方面的工作已做出卓越的成绩。我们应该加紧在这一方面学习苏联的先进经验。此外，如人工控制云雨和气候改造等，对国民经济的发展有巨大的意义。在这方面，我们更需吸收世界各国的先进技术，结合我国的自然条件，积极进行研究。
    气象科学对各种国民经济的发展有很大的作用，但气象科学本身的发展，更需依赖其他国民经济部门。交通和邮电的建设，对气象测站网的发展起着决定性的作用；无线电工业更是高空观测仪器和更准确的天气预报所需的电子计算机的基础；喷射技术与和平利用原子能更对高层大气的探测和大气环流的研究提供了新的可能性。随着我国工业体系的建成和其他有关科学的进步，我国气象事业将能更进一步服务于伟大的祖国建设。
