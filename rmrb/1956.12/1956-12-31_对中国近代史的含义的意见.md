    Opinions on the Meaning of Modern Chinese History
    Recently, many history workers have put forward new opinions on the question of the meaning of modern Chinese history. Modern Chinese history has conventionally referred to the eighty years from the Opium War of 1840 to the May Fourth Movement of 1919; the period after the May Fourth Movement of 1919 until today is generally called modern Chinese history. In the recent discussions on the periodization of modern history, many people have expressed different opinions on this division, believing that the period from 1840 to 1949 should be unified into one historical period.
    Lin Dunkui was the first to propose this view at the Sixth Scientific Discussion Conference of the Renmin University of China. He believes that although this period includes two different revolutionary stages of old and new democracy, the nature of Chinese society, the object of the revolution, and the nature of the revolution have remained basically unchanged. Therefore, the period from 1840 to before the founding of the People's Republic of China belongs to the scope of modern Chinese history.
    Lin Dunkui's opinion was endorsed by comrades such as Dai Yi at the same discussion conference. However, Dai Yi believes that whether the history from 1840 to 1949 should be called modern history is still worth considering. Because the so-called modern history and contemporary history actually only have relative meaning and do not have a strict scientific meaning. Dai Yi suggested calling 1840-1949 the history of semi-colonial and semi-feudal China.
    Rong Mengyuan also expressed his agreement with Lin Dunkui's opinion in his article "Discussion on the Periodization of Modern Chinese History." He believes that if the period from the New Democratic Revolution to the present is regarded as contemporary history, then the so-called modern history is only half of the history of semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, while contemporary history includes the history of two societies with different natures before and after the founding of the People's Republic of China, which is inappropriate in terms of its scientific nature. He believes that in the past, especially before 1949, we regarded the period of the New Democratic Revolution as contemporary history and the period of the Old Democratic Revolution as modern history. At that time, the nature of Chinese society did not change, and it was appropriate to distinguish history according to the differences between the two stages of the democratic revolution. But today, after the victory of the Chinese people's democratic revolution, the nature of Chinese society and the nature of the revolution have changed, and it would be inappropriate to continue to divide the historical stages in the old way.
    At the comprehensive university literature and history teaching syllabus review meeting held in July this year, historians also discussed the meaning of modern history, believing that modern history is generally understood as the history of the capitalist period. Since China's semi-colonial and semi-feudal society is a variant of capitalist society, it is more appropriate to call the period from the Opium War to the founding of the People's Republic of China modern Chinese history. In this way, combining China's "modern history" and "contemporary history" is beneficial for teaching and scientific research. However, considering that the two names "modern history" and "contemporary history" have been used for a long time and already represent certain meanings, sudden changes may not conform to customs. At the same time, the names "modern history" and "contemporary history" are not very precise terms, so it is suggested that the Chinese history from 1840 to 1949 be called "Chinese History - the Era of Semi-colonialism and Semi-feudalism"; and the period after 1949 be called "Chinese History - the Era of the People's Republic of China."

### 对中国近代史的含义的意见

    对中国近代史的含义的意见
    关于中国近代史的含义问题，近来不少历史工作者提出了新的意见。中国近代史，习惯上是指1840年鸦片战争到1919年五四运动这八十年间的历史；1919年五四运动以后直到今天，一般地称为中国现代史。在最近对于近代史分期问题的讨论中，不少人对这样的划分提出不同的意见，认为应把1840年到1949年统一为一个历史时期。
    林敦奎在中国人民大学第六次科学讨论会上最先提出这种主张，他认为这段时期内虽然包括了旧民主主义和新民主主义两个不同的革命阶段，但是中国社会的性质、革命的对象和性质基本上没有变化，所以1840年以后至中华人民共和国成立以前是属于中国近代史的范畴。
    林敦奎的意见在同一个讨论会上得到戴逸等同志的赞同。但是戴逸认为从1840—1949年的历史是否叫近代史，还值得商榷。因为所谓近代史、现代史，实际上只有相对的意义，没有一个严格的科学的含义。戴逸建议把1840—1949年叫做半殖民地半封建的中国史。
    荣孟源在“关于中国近代史分期问题的讨论”一文中，也表示同意林敦奎的意见。他认为如果从新民主主义革命起到目前止作为现代史，那么所谓近代史只是半殖民地半封建社会历史的一半，而现代史却包括着中华人民共和国成立前后两个不同性质社会的历史，这样就其科学性来说是不妥当的。他认为从前，特别是1949年以前，我们把新民主主义革命时期作为现代史，把旧民主主义革命时期作为近代史，那时中国社会性质没有改变，按两段民主主义革命的不同来区分历史是应该的。但今天中国人民民主革命胜利之后，中国社会性质和革命性质已经改变，再保守着旧日的样子划分历史阶段就不妥当了。
    在今年7月间举行的综合大学文史教学大纲审订会议上，史学家们对近代史的含义问题也作了讨论，认为近代史一般了解为资本主义时期的历史，中国半殖民地半封建社会既然是资本主义社会的一种变种，因此将鸦片战争到中华人民共和国成立时止的这段历史称为中国近代史比较恰当。这样，将中国“近代史”和“现代史”打通，对于教学和科学研究都是有好处的。但考虑到“近代史”和“现代史”两个名称沿用已久，已经代表一定的含义，突然改变恐难合于习惯，同时“近代史”“现代史”的名称也不是含义十分精确的用语，所以建议将1840—1949年间的中国历史称为“中国史——半殖民地半封建时代”；1949年以后称为“中国史——中华人民共和国时代”。
