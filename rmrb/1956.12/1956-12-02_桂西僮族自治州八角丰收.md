　　Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture Achieves Bumper Star Anise Harvest
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The star anise (Chinese star anise), a specialty of the Zuojiang and Youjiang river basins in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, has had a bumper harvest. It is estimated that this year's output for the entire prefecture may reach more than 57,000 dan, an increase of 64% over last year.
    Last year, the autonomous prefecture's star anise experienced a period of sluggish sales. This year, the trade departments actively overcame the business practice of "waiting for customers to come to the door" and organized several sales teams to promote sales in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Northeast, North China, and other regions.
