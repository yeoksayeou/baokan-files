Qingdao Carries Out Prevention and Treatment Work for Chronic and Occupational Diseases

(Our Newspaper News) Qingdao City has initially launched the prevention and treatment of chronic and occupational diseases in factories and enterprises, and has achieved results.

From the second half of last year to October of this year, sixteen sanatorium units in the city have allocated 542 beds specifically for the treatment of tuberculosis, having received a total of 847 tuberculosis patients. After one to four periods of sanatorium treatment, the average cure rate is above 60%.

Qingdao Seamen's Union system's Qingdao Port Authority, Qingdao Shipping Branch Bureau, and Qingdao Aquatic Products Company, among other units, are also actively carrying out the work of eliminating syphilis, a disease left over from the old society, among employees and their family members. This work is led by the Syphilis Prevention and Control Team specifically formed by the Qingdao Seamen's Union, with the assistance of the Qingdao Federation of Trade Unions and the Municipal People's Committee Health Bureau. The first phase involved 63 syphilis patients, who underwent their first course of treatment in October. All their treatment expenses are borne by the public.

The prevention and treatment of diseases such as trichomonas vaginalis, rheumatism, chronic gastroenteritis, and bronchitis have also been gradually launched or are about to be launched.

The Municipal Health Bureau and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions conducted a survey of chronic and occupational diseases among employees from December of last year to April of this year. After the survey, the focus was placed on the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis and syphilis, and a prevention and treatment plan for several major diseases was drafted. (Luo Ke)

    从去年下半年开始到今年10月，全市已由十六处疗养单位，拨出五百四十二个床位，专门用于治疗结核病，先后共接收了八百四十七名结核病患者。这些患者经过一至四期不同时期的疗养，治愈率平均达60％以上。
    青岛海员工会系统的青岛港务局、青岛航运分局和青岛水产公司等单位，在职工和职工家属中驱除旧社会遗留下来的梅毒病的工作，也在积极进行。这一工作由青岛海员工会专门组成的梅毒防治小组领导，市工会联合会和市人民委员会卫生局加以协助。第一期共接受梅毒病患者六十三名，10月份他们已进行过第一个疗程。他们治疗费用全部是由公家负担的。
    对于阴道滴虫病、风湿病、慢性胃肠炎和支气管炎等的防治工作，也已陆续展开或即将展开。
    市卫生局和市工会联合会曾在去年12月到今年4月间，对职工中患慢性病和职业病的情况进行了调查。调查后即以防治结核病和梅毒病为重点进行工作，并拟订出对几种主要疾病的防治规划。（罗珂）
