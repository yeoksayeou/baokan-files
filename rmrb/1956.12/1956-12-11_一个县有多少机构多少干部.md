How Many Organizations and Cadres Does a County Have?
Tantian

In the past year or two, expanding organizations and increasing personnel has become a trend. Especially after agricultural cooperativization, the slogan of "keeping up with the needs of the cooperativization movement" has become a powerful justification for inflating organizations. What exactly needs to be "kept up with" after cooperativization? Is it the unlimited increase of personnel and establishments, or something else? This is a topic worthy of research. Taking the county as an example, it is not difficult to see the whole picture.

Dozens of Bureaus and Countless Companies

How many organizations are there in a county-level agency? Departments, commissions, bureaus, sections, offices, institutes, and banks number no less than dozens. In counties like Linyi, Shandong Province, the county party committee has eight departments: organization, propaganda, cooperation, finance and trade, industry and transportation, culture and education, united front, and political-legal affairs. There are also four commissions: supervisory, labor, women's, and youth, plus an office and an inspection team. The county people's committee has an even larger setup, with eleven bureaus for agriculture, water conservancy, finance, taxation, grain, procurement, commerce, industry, education, public security, and military service, nine sections for forestry, transportation, statistics, handicrafts, labor, culture, health, civil affairs, and personnel, three committees for planning, demobilized soldier affairs and construction, and sports, an office, and several temporary and semi-permanent offices for finance, grain and trade, elections, and production and disaster relief. There are also cadres in charge of literacy and those managing ethnic and religious affairs. The political-legal system includes courts and procuratorates. In addition, there are the People's Bank, the Agricultural Bank, and the Post and Telecommunications Bureau. Some of these management departments also have several subordinate institutions, such as the livestock and veterinary station of the agriculture bureau, the afforestation station of the forestry section, the water conservancy team of the water conservancy bureau, the transportation management station of the transportation section, the registration office of the finance bureau, and the cultural center of the culture section. The supply and marketing cooperative has its own system, with sixteen sections, three departments, and two institutes in the county cooperative alone, in addition to a director's office, three sections for cadre work: cadre, salary, and cadre education. There is also a catering section managing a restaurant, a supply section, and a supply department. As for the companies in the commercial system, there are almost all kinds, such as general merchandise, cultural supplies, textiles, specialized products, food, trade, timber, coal and construction materials, electrical appliances, chemical raw materials, medicine, oils and fats, aquatic products, and the soon-to-be-independent pastry and confectionery company. There is also an insurance company in the financial system. Adding the companies at the prefectural level, the streets of Linyi are filled with signs of all sizes. Linyi is like this, and other counties are similar, except that the average county has fewer companies, while this county has several companies with cross-county tasks.

Is it necessary to establish so many organizations? This is a complex question that needs to be studied individually to arrive at an answer. Here, we will only provide some clues for researching this issue, based on the views of responsible comrades from several counties and from a few specific instances.

Is It Necessary to Have So Many Organizations?

For example, what can the labor section do in the county? The allocation of labor, employment, labor protection, etc., are basically matters for the agricultural production cooperatives. There are very few such problems in other areas. Even if someone needs to manage them, can it be placed in the civil affairs section? Regarding transportation management, there is a transportation section, a highway station, and a transportation management station. The tasks of these organizations are nothing more than managing highways and organizing civilian transportation. In a county like Yiyuan, with only 160 li of highways, and with civilian transportation relying on the arrangements of agricultural production cooperatives, it is not necessary to set up so many organizations. Junan County has a total of twelve handicraft cooperatives, a county handicraft union, and a handicraft section. The county cooperative has twenty-five cadres and four sections, meaning that an average of two cadres manage one cooperative. The nature and scope of the tax bureau's tasks have changed dramatically since the basic completion of cooperativization and the transformation of private industry and commerce. Now, taxation is greatly centralized, basically involving four entities: state-owned, joint state-private, handicraft cooperatives, and agricultural production cooperatives. This is different from the past, when it was necessary to work with thousands of households, especially to struggle against capitalism. However, the organization remains the same. The tax bureaus in these counties still have a staff of fifty, sixty, or even seventy people. Some have suggested that the tax bureau and the finance bureau could be merged, which is reasonable. It seems that the statistics bureau and the planning commission also need not be separate, because planning relies on statistics. It is easier to do things together, while separating them can easily lead to mutual entanglement. As for the work of the procurement bureau, it is highly seasonal. After the season is over, there is really not much to do. Is it possible not to set up this unit separately?

How Many Things Are There to Do With So Many People?

The county's military service bureau generally has forty or fifty people, while Junan County has nearly sixty. The military service bureau has few tasks on weekdays. The annual conscription work is done by the whole party, and it is a real waste of time to keep so many people on a permanent basis. Many cadres are idle and bored. A county generally has two banks, often with hundreds of people. Linyi County's two banks have a total of more than 130 people. It is worth studying whether so many people are needed to work exclusively in banking in a county with a population of several hundred thousand. The supply and marketing cooperative has the most people. Junan County has 1,912 cadres in the supply and marketing cooperative, while Linyi County has more than 1,400. The current situation is that many of the supply and marketing cooperative's businesses (such as the purchase of major agricultural products and the wholesale supply of many daily necessities) have been replaced by several newly established administrative organizations or specialized companies. It is really not necessary to maintain such a large organization.

Where Is the Benefit of Such a Fine Division of Labor?

The commercial system has a very fine division of labor. Almost every company that exists at the higher level and in the cities has been established in the countryside. For example, a pastry and confectionery company was established in mountainous areas like Pingyi. The masses here do not need many pastries and candies. If they do use a little, they can buy it from the supply and marketing cooperative or the department store. Since there is an organization, it must do things. It is said that the pastry and confectionery company once argued with the supply and marketing cooperative over who should manage the frying of youtiao (fried dough sticks), because youtiao is similar to pastries. There are similar things in Linyi. Last winter, under the instruction of the Provincial Department of Commerce, a trading company was established with twenty-five cadres, but it has not really opened for business until now. This is because almost everything is handled by the supply and marketing cooperative and specialized companies. After several requests for instructions, it was said that the trading company could manage barber shops, bathhouses, restaurants, hotels, and sauce gardens. However, because the county town is not large and there are very few of these industries, so many people are not needed. The cadres are so idle that they can only play the huqin (Chinese violin) and play ball. Later, the county took away twenty people, but the comrades from the Department of Commerce who came to inspect the work did not think so, believing that the lack of work was due to a failure to carry out business properly. According to some comrades in the county, setting up several comprehensive retail stores in the countryside would not only facilitate the masses but also save a lot of people. With department stores and retail stores of supply and marketing cooperatives, why bother to divide pastries and candies, cultural supplies, and cotton fabrics? It is no good to the masses if they have to run to the department store to buy soap and then to the textile store to buy two feet of cloth. Moreover, setting up another company requires a whole set of managers and section chiefs, and even setting up a retail store requires a director.

Two Hundred to One, Seventy to Seven

The problem is not just that there are many units. What is particularly noteworthy are the results caused by this. In Junan County, there are a total of more than 3,900 cadres who "eat public grain" (excluding township cadres and teachers), and Linyi County is also close to 3,000. The two counties have a combined population of 1.4 million, which means that on average, one out of every two hundred people is a "public servant," that is, one person out of every forty or so households is "working in the office." If you add township cadres, it will be even more. This is indeed an alarming proportion! What kind of "public affairs" are so many people "handling"? Of course, they are in all walks of life, but it is worth studying. For example, of the more than 3,900 cadres in Junan County, 2,805 are in the finance and trade system (excluding those in party and government management departments), accounting for more than 70% of the county's cadres; nearly 260 are in the production and cooperation system (including the county party committee's cooperation department, the three bureaus of agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy and their subordinate institutions, resident cooperative cadres, the Agricultural Bank, and half of the district cadres), accounting for less than 7%. People understand that the fundamental task of rural work is to develop agricultural production and run cooperatives well, and other undertakings can only be fully developed on this basis. However, the number of cadres who regularly and directly manage this fundamental task is less than one-tenth of the number of cadres in the finance and trade system. Isn't this a question that deserves serious study?

Top-Heavy, All from Above

The result of this situation is that the leading cadres of the county are distressed, and the district and township cadres cannot bear it. With so many tasks in the county, the leaders have to spend the whole day in meetings discussing matters in all walks of life and solving increasingly complex administrative affairs. Most of the backbone cadres in the districts have been transferred to the county, leaving only seven or eight people in each district to do the work, and only three or four semi-detached cadres in the townships. However, "all rivers flow to the sea," and everything has to be implemented through the districts and townships. A township cadre in Junan County calculated his day's work as follows: He originally planned to hold a meeting in the morning to study the winter production plan, but a woman came at dawn to raise a dispute over forest trees, which lasted for two hours. After breakfast, comrades from the Oil and Grease Company came to study the purchase of peanuts, and before they finished, a demobilized soldier came to ask him to repair his courtyard wall, so he spent the whole morning. On the way home for lunch, comrades from the highway station came to discuss the matter of hitting stones. In the afternoon, the court came to judge a marriage case, and he had to accompany them for half a day. In the evening, comrades from the forestry department came to investigate tree seeds, asking him to find out the types and sizes of all the trees in the township in order to calculate how many seeds can be produced, and he had to send someone to measure the trees one by one tomorrow. By this time, it was already very late, and he had to find someone to cook for this comrade. In this way, the plan to study winter production collapsed. His conclusion was: "All the people who come to the township are from above, and we have to do whatever they ask. Township cadres are busy with miscellaneous things all day long, and they just don't have time to do the main things."

Not only are the masses and grassroots cadres dissatisfied with this situation, but also the comrades in the county are unwilling to do so, but the establishment of all these organizations is stipulated by the higher authorities, and they have to comply. Each system above wants to have a "grip," always wanting to set up a "grassroots organization." This is the root cause of why county-level agencies are more than twice as large as they were two years ago.

    一个县有多少机构多少干部
    坦天
    近一两年来，扩大机构增加人员，已经成了一种风气。特别是在农业合作化以后，“跟上合作化运动的需要”的口号，已经成为膨胀机构的有力根据。到底刚刚合作化后需要“跟上”的是什么？是无限制地增人设事，还是其他？这是一个很值得研究的题目。以县为例，不难看出个究竟。
    科局几十个公司数不清
    一个县级机关到底有多少机构？部、委、局、科、院、行，不下几十个。像山东省临沂这样的县，县委设有组织、宣传、合作、财贸、工业交通、文教、统战、政法等八个部。监委、工委、妇委和青委等四委，另外还有一个办公室和一个巡视组。县人民委员会的摊子更大，设有农业、水利、财政、税务、粮食、采购、商业、工业、教育、公安、兵役等十一个局，林业、交通、统计、手工业、劳动、文化、卫生、民政、人事等九个科，计划、转业建设、体育等三个委员会，一个办公室和财粮贸、选举、生产救灾等若干临时性的和半永久性的办公室。还有没设独立门户的扫盲干部、管理民族事务和宗教事务的干部，政法系统的有法院和检察院。另外还有人民银行、农业银行和邮电局。这些管理部门中，有一些还下设若干事业单位，像农业局的畜牧兽医站、林业科的造林站、水利局的水利组、交通科的运输管理站、财政局的册籍室、文化科的文化馆等等。供销社自成系统，除了区社和若干门市部以外，光是县社就设有十六个科、三个部和两个所，再加一个主任室。其中管干部工作的就有干部、工资和干部教育等三个科。还有管一个饭店的饮食科。有一个供应科，还有个供应部。至于商业系统的公司，那就几乎是应有尽有，如百货、文化用品、纺织品、专卖、食品、贸易、木材、煤建、交电、化工原料、药材、油脂、水产以及将要自立门户的糕点糖果等十四个公司。另外还有个财政系统的保险公司。再加上专区一级的公司，临沂城的街头巷尾，挂满了大大小小的招牌。临沂如此，其他县也差不多。只是一般县的公司少些，而这个县有几个公司有跨县任务。
    是不是必需设立这么多的机构？这是个复杂的问题，需要逐个地加以研究才能作出答案。这里只就几个县的负责同志的看法，从几件事情上去提供一点研究这个问题的线索。
    机构这样多是否有必要
    像劳动科，在县里究竟有多少事情可做呢？劳动力的调配、劳动就业、劳动保护等等，基本上都是农业生产合作社的事情，其他方面的这类问题是极少的，即使也需要有人管管，是否可以放在民政科里呢？像管理交通的，有交通科，有公路站，还设了个运输管理站，这些机构的任务总不外是管理公路和组织民力运输。像沂源这样的县，不过一百六十里公路，而民力运输又依靠农业生产合作社的安排，大可不必设这么多的机构。莒南县总共十二处手工业合作社，县里有一个手工业联社，还有一个手工业科。县社有二十五个干部，设了四个科，这样，平均两个干部管一个社。像税务局，自合作化和私营工商业改造基本完成以后，任务的性质和范围起了极大的变化。现在税务大大集中了，基本上是四家：国营、公私合营、手工业社和农业生产合作社。这与过去要作千家万户的工作、特别是要和资本主义作斗争的任务不同了。但是机构依旧，这些县的税务局的编制还是五十、六十以至七十多个人。有人提出可以考虑把税务局和财政局合起来，这是有道理的。统计局和计划委员会似乎也可以不必分立，因为计划要依靠统计，在一起，许多事情好办，分开来，反而容易互相牵扯。至于采购局的工作，季节性很强，过了季节，实在也没有多少事情，是否可以不单设这个单位？
    人员这样多事情有多少
    县的兵役局，一般都有四、五十个人，莒南县则有近六十个人。兵役局平日任务不多，一年一度的征兵工作又是全党动手，常年保持这么多的人，实在无事可干，许多干部闲的发慌。一个县总有两个银行，常常是上百个人。临沂县的两个银行共有一百三十多个人，几十万人口的一个县，是否需要这么多的人去专作银行工作，确是值得研究。人最多的还算是供销合作社，莒南全县的供销合作社干部有一千九百十二人，临沂县有一千四百多人。现在的情况是，供销合作社的许多业务（像主要农产品的收购、许多日用品的批发供应）为若干新设的行政机构或专业公司所代替，实在不必再维持这么庞大的机构。
    分工这样细好处在哪里
    商业系统分工要算是很细了，上级和城市里有的公司，农村里几乎都有了。比如糕点糖果公司，在平邑这样的山区里也设立起来。这里的群众需要的糕点糖果实在不多，就是用一点，也可以到供销合作社或百货公司去买。既然有了机构，就得办事。据说糕点糖果公司曾经和供销合作社发生了谁管炸油条的争执，因为油条是类乎糕点一类的东西。在临沂也有类似的事：去年冬，在省商业厅的指示下，设立了贸易公司，配备了二十五个干部，可是直到现在还没有真正地开张营业。因为所有的事几乎都叫供销合作社和专业公司办了。经过几次请示，才说贸易公司可以管理发、澡塘、饭馆、旅社、酱园的事。但因县城不大，这些行业寥寥无几，实在用不着这么多人，干部闲得无法，只有拉拉胡琴、打打球。后来县里从中抽走了二十个人，商业厅去检查工作的同志却不以为然，认为没事干是没有好好开展业务。据一些县里的同志谈，在农村多设几个综合性的零售店，既便利群众，又可以省很多人；有了百货公司和供销合作社的零售店，何必硬把糕点糖果、文化用品、棉布绸缎再分出去？群众买肥皂跑百货公司，再买二尺布又得跑纺织品门市部，有什么好处？何况多设一个公司，就得配备一整套的经理、股长，就是设个零售店也还要有主任。
    二百比一七十比七
    问题还不在于单位多，特别值得注意的是由此而造成的结果。莒南全县“吃公粮”的干部（不包括乡干部和教师），总共是三千九百多人，临沂县也靠近三千。两个县加起来有一百四十万人口，平均计算，每二百个人中就有一个是“公家人”，就是说每四十几户居民中，就有一个人“办公”。如果加上乡干部那就更多。这确是一个惊人的比例！这么多人都“办”的什么“公事”呢？当然各行各业都有，但很值得研究一下。比如：莒南县的三千九百多名干部中，属财经贸易系统（不包括党、政管理部门的人）的二千八百零五名，占全县干部的70％多；属生产合作系统的（包括县委合作部、农林水三局及其所属事业单位、驻社干部、农业银行及半数区干部）近二百六十人，占7％不足。人们都了解，农村工作的根本任务是发展农业生产、办好合作社，其他事业只有在这个基础上才有充分发展的可能，然而经常和直接管这项根本任务的干部却不足财经贸易系统的干部的十分之一，这岂不是大大值得研究的问题？
    头重脚轻都是上级
    这样弄的结果，使县的领导干部苦恼，使区、乡干部吃不消。县里的头绪这么多，领导上就得整天开会研究各行各业的事情，和解决日益复杂的机关事务。区上的骨干大都调到县里去了，每区只剩下七、八个人作工作，乡里也只有三、四个半脱产的干部。然而“千条河流归大海”，什么事还得通过区、乡去执行。莒南县的一位乡干部计算了一下自己一天的工作，情况是这样：原打算上午开会研究冬季生产计划，可是天刚亮，一个妇女来提出林木纠纷问题，一直谈了两个钟头；早饭后，油脂公司的同志来研究买花生米的事，没研究完，又有个复员军人来要求给他修院墙，这样用了一上午；在回家吃午饭的路上，公路站的同志来联系打石子的事；过午，法院来判决一个婚姻案件，又去陪了半天；晚上，林业部门的同志来调查树种子，要求把全乡所有的树木种类、大小都弄清楚，好计算能出多少种子，明天就得派人挨棵树去量量。这时天已经很晚了，还得找人弄饭给这位同志吃。这样，研究冬季生产的计划就垮了。他的结论是：“到乡里来的人都是上级，叫办什么就得办，乡干部是整天净事，就是没有时间办主要的事。”
    不但群众、基层干部不满意这种状况，就是县里的同志也不愿意这样办，但是所有这些机构的设立，都是上级规定的，不能不照办。上面每个系统都想有个“抓手”，总想设一个“基层组织”。这就是县级机关比两年前大了两倍以上的根源所在。
