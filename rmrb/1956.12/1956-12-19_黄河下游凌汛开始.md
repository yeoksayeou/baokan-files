Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou Electric Dispatch: The downstream Yellow River ice run has begun. The newly established flood prevention office of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission began flood prevention work on the 15th.

    Recently, the temperature in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, below Lankao County, Henan Province, has dropped to minus 10 to 15 degrees Celsius, and the river banks on both sides have frozen. The river surface in sections such as Gao Village dangerous works in Dongming County, Henan Province, and Sangzhuang in Fan County, Shandong Province, have been frozen. The thickest ice is 13 centimeters. Now downstream of Gao Village, ice floes are broken and flowing. A section of the river in Huimin County, Shandong Province, was blocked by ice floes on the 14th, gradually causing water to rise and freeze the river. The Flood Prevention Office of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission is closely monitoring the development of the Yellow River ice run and is constantly instructing flood prevention agencies at all levels along the river to step up prevention.

    As the lower reaches of the Yellow River enter the ice run, the middle reaches of the river are also gradually being frozen.

    黄河下游凌汛开始
    据新华社郑州电　黄河下游凌汛开始，黄河水利委员会新成立的防凌办公室已经在15日开始防凌工作。
    最近，黄河下游河南省兰考县以下气温降到摄氏零下十度到十五度，两岸河边都已经封冻。河南省东明县高村险工和山东省范县桑庄等段的河面都被冰封。冰块最厚的达一公寸三公分。现在高村以下，河道里冰块断裂，普遍淌凌。山东省惠民县一段河道，在14日曾被冰块卡住，逐渐往上卡水封河。黄河水利委员会的防凌办公室正密切注视黄河凌汛的发展，随时指示沿河各级防凌机构加紧防范。
    在黄河下游进入凌汛的时候，中游河道也逐渐被冰封住。
