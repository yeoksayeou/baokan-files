    Yunnan Province, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture
    Vigorously Develops Ethnic Minority Education Work
    (Our report) The education work for ethnic minorities in the border areas of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, has developed. As of now, there are 257 primary schools in six counties including Luxi, Ruili, Lianshan, Yingjiang, Lianghe, and Longchuan, with more than 25,000 children enrolled, an increase of eight times compared to before liberation. In order to meet the needs of the development of ethnic education, the autonomous prefecture has cultivated a large number of ethnic minority teachers in recent years, changing the past situation of having no ethnic minority teachers. Among the seventy-two teachers in Ruili County, there are thirty-three ethnic minority teachers. At present, in addition to continuing to train teachers in ethnic normal schools, the autonomous prefecture has also sent sixty outstanding Dai and Jingpo youths to ethnic institutes, health institutes, and ethnic normal schools in Beijing and Kunming for further studies, and has also established short-term training courses for ethnic teachers in the prefecture, where one hundred and fifteen ethnic teachers are furthering their studies.
    In strengthening ethnic education work, relevant departments also pay attention to helping Han teachers become ethnicized. In Luxi County, most of the Han teachers can use Dai and Jingpo languages and scripts to teach, which greatly improves the quality of teaching.
    In terms of using ethnic scripts as teaching materials, the autonomous prefecture has successively issued 7,000 copies of Dai language and arithmetic textbooks, more than 17,000 copies of Dai literacy textbooks, and has compiled 34 kinds of popular reading materials in Dai, which have been warmly welcomed by the Dai people.

    云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州
　　大力发展少数民族教育工作
    本报讯　云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州边疆地区少数民族教育工作有了发展。截至目前，潞西、瑞丽、莲山、盈江、梁河和陇川等六县已有小学二百五十七所，入学儿童已达二万五千多人，比解放前增加八倍。为了适应民族教育发展的需要，几年来自治州培养了不少民族师资，改变了过去没有民族教师的面貌。瑞丽县七十二个教师中，就有三十三个民族教师。目前自治州除了继续在民族师范学校中培养师资外，还保送了六十名傣族和景颇族的优秀青年到北京和昆明的民族学院、卫生学院和民族师范学校深造，以及在州里开办了民族教师短期训练班，有一百十五个民族教师在这里深造。
    在加强民族教育工作中，有关部门还注意帮助汉族教师民族化。潞西县汉族教师中，大部分能用傣、景颇民族语言和文字进行教课，大大地提高了教学质量。
    在以民族文字作教材方面，自治州先后发行了傣文语文和算术课本达七千册、傣文扫盲课本一万七千多册，并用傣文编译了通俗读物三十四种，受到了傣族人民热烈欢迎。　（罗声云）
