The "Lotus" Agricultural Cooperative's Bumper Harvest
The Lotus Agricultural Production Cooperative in Longli County, Guizhou Province, was established in February of this year. The Bouyei, Miao, and Han members of the cooperative meticulously cultivated the land, resulting in a rice yield this year that was more than 60% higher than last year (an average of about 850 jin per mu from 3,662 mu of rice paddies). Combined with income from various sideline productions, 96.4% of the cooperative members saw an increase in their income.

　　The Lotus Cooperative raised a large number of fat pigs and twelve sows. By using the "Yorkshire" boar for breeding, the piglets born to the sows are particularly robust.
　　To prevent diseases such as wheat smut, they are using chemical powders to treat the seeds.
　　Members of all ethnic groups are sending public grain and selling surplus grain in groups to support national construction.
　　Young Miao women grew full-grained millet and large pumpkins in the "Maiden Field." The Maiden Field is a needlework field set aside when the cooperative was established, respecting the customs of ethnic minority women.
　　In the evening, the members gather together to listen to broadcasts from various places.
　　The intense autumn plowing and planting work has begun. The more than ten oxen raised by feeder Feng Youwen are all strong and never lose weight. He also cuts green grass and dries it into hay as winter fodder to keep the oxen in good condition.
　　After the establishment of the cooperative, the habit of not plowing the fields in winter was changed. Now the members of the plowing team have plunged into the intense autumn plowing.

　　左图是在初冬的阳光下，社员们忙着翻晒谷子。
　　莲花社喂养了大批肥猪和十二口母猪。由于采用“约克”公猪配种的方法，母猪生出来的猪崽特别肥壮。
　　为了防止小麦发生黑穗病等病害，他们正在使用化学药粉拌种。
　　各族社员成群结队送公粮、卖余粮，支援国家建设。
　　苗族青年妇女在“姑娘田”里种出了颗粒丰满的小米和大南瓜。姑娘田是在建社时尊重少数民族妇女风俗习惯留出的针线田。
　　晚上，社员们欢聚在一起，收听各地的广播。
　　紧张的秋耕秋种工作开始了，饲养员冯友文负责喂养的十多条耕牛个个肥壮，从不退膘。他还割了青草，晒成青干草作为耕牛保膘的冬粮。
　　建社后，改变了不犁田过冬的习惯。现在耕田队的队员已投入紧张的秋耕中。
