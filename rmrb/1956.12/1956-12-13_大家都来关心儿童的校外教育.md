Everyone Should Care About Children's Extracurricular Education
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

Since the beginning of this autumn semester, many middle and primary schools in cities have implemented a two-shift system, making the education of children outside of school hours a more acute and prominent issue than in previous years. Many young children have increased time for extracurricular activities, and teachers have relatively less contact with children. At the same time, due to the lack of extracurricular activity venues and the failure of other work to keep up, children's extracurricular lives are impoverished and monotonous. Most children's extracurricular activities consist of wandering around streets, department stores, and so on. As a result, many children are doing poorly in their studies and picking up bad habits. A few children are threatened and enticed by remnants of hooligans and habitual thieves in society, and are doing bad things. If this continues, it will seriously affect the healthy growth of the younger generation.

The widespread implementation of the two-shift system in middle and primary schools is a major measure by the government to care for children's education, and an effective way to fully utilize existing school buildings and equipment to meet children's enrollment requirements. It is welcomed by the broad masses. The new problem that has emerged since the implementation of the two-shift system requires the help of schools, families, and all sectors of society to solve it.

Schools are the main battlefield for children's education, and they have an unshirkable responsibility to guide children's extracurricular activities. However, many schools currently have the phenomenon of only focusing on teaching and not on educating people, only focusing on classroom activities and not extracurricular activities, and only focusing on what happens inside the school and not outside the school. Many teachers only pay attention to children's academic performance, but do not care about the development of children's ideology and morality, and do not understand or provide regular education about children's lives and behaviors outside of school. When children are found to have bad behaviors such as violating discipline and stealing, some teachers rarely analyze the reasons why children make mistakes and patiently explain the principles clearly. Instead, they give too much criticism and accusations, so they cannot achieve the expected educational effect. Some schools even abandon their educational responsibility and simply expel children after discovering that they have serious bad behaviors outside of school. Many schools emphasize the heavy teaching workload and the lack of school facilities and equipment, and do not actively overcome difficulties to carry out extracurricular activities. Some schools do not actively cooperate with extracurricular children's education institutions to use all forces to widely carry out children's extracurricular activities. For example, Beijing originally had nine children's film screening teams, but because many schools were afraid of trouble and did not organize children to watch movies, the number of children's screening teams has now been reduced by three.

After the implementation of the two-shift system in middle and primary schools, due to certain objective conditions, schools do face some specific difficulties in leading children to carry out extracurricular activities. However, as long as we actively think of solutions, some difficulties can be overcome. We should comprehensively care for and educate children, caring for both their lives inside and outside the school, and caring for both their academic studies and their ideology and morality. Schools should adhere to positive education for children and pay attention to active guidance. Schools should also strengthen their work with parents, establish close ties with parents, and jointly assume the responsibility of educating children. In addition, schools should also attach importance to the work of the Young Pioneers, carry out a variety of activities that children love through the Young Pioneers, and influence and educate children. In activities, we must give play to children's enthusiasm and initiative. Only in this way can the Young Pioneers be trusted and loved by children and play a greater educational role.

Every parent hopes that their children will grow up healthily and become useful talents for the country's construction. However, the issue of educating children has not yet aroused widespread attention from parents. Currently, children spend most of their time in the family. If parents neglect the education of their children, it will have serious consequences. Parents should take on the responsibility of educating their children and earnestly care for their children's studies and lives.

Since liberation, the state has established many extracurricular children's education institutions, but they still cannot meet the needs of children. In order to ensure that children receive a good education outside of school and carry out legitimate and beneficial activities, relevant departments should set up more extracurricular activity venues for children as much as possible. Existing extracurricular children's education institutions should also adapt to this situation, carry out more mass activities, cultivate activists for schools, and introduce experiences in this regard to promote the development of extracurricular activities.

Currently, due to economic constraints, the state cannot establish more extracurricular children's education institutions. Therefore, it is a practical and feasible way to solve the current shortage of extracurricular activity venues for children by designating certain venues and stipulating certain times in adult cultural activity venues for relevant departments to lead children to carry out activities. For example, some cultural centers only hold adult activities for two nights and one day a week, and the other times, venues, and equipment are idle. As long as these units allocate a certain amount of time, they can solve the problem of activity venues for some children, and it will not hinder adult activities. Some places have already started doing this. However, there are still some units that dislike children's lack of discipline, are afraid of trouble, and use excuses such as insufficient cadres and insufficient venues to be unwilling to do this work. This should be corrected.

Children's education is related to the future of our country. Educating children is the responsibility of the entire society. Everyone should care about children and let the new generation grow up healthily and take over our great cause.

    大家都来关心儿童的校外教育
    本报评论员
    今年秋季开学以后，许多城市的中、小学校实行了二部制，校外儿童的教育问题比往年更加尖锐和突出了。许多少年儿童在校外活动的时间增多，教师和儿童接触的时间相对地减少，同时由于校外活动场所缺乏，其他各项工作没有相应地跟上去，因而儿童的课外和校外生活贫乏、枯燥，大多数儿童的校外活动是逛马路、逛百货公司，等等。许多儿童因此学习成绩不好，并且沾染了不好的习惯。少数儿童受了社会上残余的流氓、惯窃分子的威胁引诱，做出了坏事。这样下去，将会严重地影响年轻一代的健全成长。
    中、小学普遍地实行二部制，是政府关怀儿童教育的一项重大措施，是充分运用现有的校舍和设备，满足儿童入学要求的一项有效的办法。它受到广大群众的欢迎。实行二部制以后，出现的这一新的问题，需要依靠学校、家庭以及社会各个方面帮助加以解决。
    学校是儿童教育的主要阵地，它对于儿童的校外活动的指导有义不容辞的责任。但是，目前有许多学校存在只管教书不管教人，只管课内不管课外，只管校内不管校外的现象。许多教师只注意儿童的学习成绩，不关心儿童思想品德的成长，对儿童在校外的生活和行为不去了解，缺乏经常的教育。当发现了儿童有不守纪律、偷窃等不良行为的时候，有的教师很少分析儿童犯错误的原因，耐心地说清楚道理，而给予过多的批评和指责，因此不能收到预期的教育效果。有的学校甚至在发现了儿童在校外有严重不良行为后，放弃了教育的责任，开除了事。许多学校强调教学任务繁重，强调学校的场地、设备不足，不去积极克服困难，开展课外活动。有些学校没有积极主动地配合校外儿童教育机关，运用各方面力量，广泛地开展儿童的课外校外活动。例如北京市原来设有九个儿童电影放映队，由于很多学校怕麻烦，不去组织儿童看电影，儿童放映队现在已经减少了三个。
    中、小学实行二部制后，由于某些客观条件的限制，学校领导儿童开展课外和校外的活动，确实有一些具体困难。但是，只要积极想办法，有些困难是可以克服的。我们应当全面地关心和教育儿童，既关心儿童校内的生活，也要关心儿童校外的生活，应当关心儿童的学业，也应当关心儿童的思想品德。学校对儿童要坚持正面教育，注意积极诱导。学校并且要加强对家长的工作，同家长取得紧密的联系，和家长一起共同负起教育儿童的责任。此外，学校还要重视少先队工作，通过少先队开展多种多样为儿童喜爱的活动，去影响和教育儿童。在活动中要发挥儿童的积极性和主动性。只有这样，少先队才能为儿童所信任和爱戴，发挥更大的教育作用。
    每个家长都希望子女健全地成长起来，成为国家建设事业的有用人材。但是，教育子女的问题还未引起家长普遍的重视。目前，儿童大部时间在家庭中，家长如果忽视对子女的教育，就会带来严重后果。家长应该把教育子女的责任担当起来，切实关心子女的学习和生活。
    解放以来，国家为儿童建立了许多儿童校外教育机关，但是，仍不能满足儿童的需要。为了使儿童在校外受到良好的教育，开展正当有益的活动，各有关部门应该尽可能地为儿童多设一些校外活动场所。现有的儿童校外教育机关，也应该适应这个情况，多开展群众性的活动，为学校培养积极分子，介绍这方面的经验，以推动课外校外活动的开展。
    目前由于经济条件限制，国家还不能够建立更多的校外儿童教育机关。因此，各有关部门在成人的文化活动场所中，划出一定的场地，规定一定时间，领导儿童开展活动，是当前解决儿童校外活动场所不足的一项切实可行的办法。例如有的文化馆在一周内，只有两个晚上、一个白天举办成人活动，其他时间、场地、设备都空闲着。只要这些单位划出一定的时间，就可解决一部分儿童的活动场所问题，而且也不妨碍成人的活动。现在有些地方已经开始这样做。但是，仍有些单位，嫌儿童不守纪律，怕麻烦，而借口干部不足，场地不够等，不愿做这方面的工作。这是应当纠正的。
    儿童教育事业，关系着我们国家的未来。教育儿童是整个社会的责任，大家都来关心儿童，让新的一代健康地成长起来，接替我们的伟大事业。
