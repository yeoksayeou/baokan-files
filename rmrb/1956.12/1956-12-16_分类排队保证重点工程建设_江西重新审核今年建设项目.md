Categorized Scheduling to Guarantee Key Project Construction
    Jiangxi Re-examines This Year's Construction Projects
    (Our Nanchang dispatch, December 12th) To guarantee the construction of key projects, the relevant basic construction leading departments in Jiangxi Province recently conducted a categorized scheduling of uncompleted basic construction projects for 1956. This year, Jiangxi Province's local basic construction tasks are larger than in any previous year. Due to limitations of manpower and resources, it is estimated that 11.87 million yuan worth of project tasks in the province will be impossible to complete within the year. To this end, the Provincial Construction Committee has re-examined and scheduled the basic construction projects for 1956. Priority is given to productive projects, followed by non-productive buildings. Among productive projects, construction is prioritized based on production needs, with urgency and order taken into consideration. Projects currently under construction will generally not be halted, and efforts will be made to complete as many projects as possible while guaranteeing key projects. Projects that have not yet commenced will not be allowed to start, except for those that are absolutely necessary, have sufficient manpower and resources prepared, and can be completed within the year. For basic construction at the prefectural and county levels, most projects are permitted to commence and efforts will be made to complete them within the year, except for a small number of projects where materials are not available and can be postponed. According to this spirit, the reduced projects account for 2.09% of the province's original planned project volume for this year, saving 2.789 million yuan in construction investment, basically ensuring the priority completion of key projects.

    分类排队保证重点工程建设
    江西重新审核今年建设项目
    本报南昌12日电　为了保证重点工程建设，江西省有关基本建设领导部门最近对1956年基本建设未完工程进行了一次分类排队，今年江西省地方基本建设任务比以往任何一年都大，由于受人力、物力限制，预计全省将有一千一百八十七万元的工程任务，在年内无法完成。为此，省建设委员会再次对1956年基本建设工程进行了审核排队。先保证生产性工程，然后是非生产性的建筑，生产性的工程又按生产需要，分别缓急、先后施工。目前正在施工的工程，一般不停工，并在保证重点工程的前提下，争取尽可能多完成些项目。目前尚未开工的工程，除因非办不可和人力、物力做了充分准备、年内又可完成的工程外，其它均不准开工；对专区和县级的基本建设，除少数工程项目因材料没有着落，并可以缓办的外，一般都准予开工，并尽可能争取年内完工。根据这个精神，削减的项目占全省今年原计划的工程总量2.09％，节约建设投资二百七十八万九千元，基本上保证了重点工程建设的优先完成。
