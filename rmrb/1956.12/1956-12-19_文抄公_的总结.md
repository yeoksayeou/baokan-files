    “Copycat”’s Self-Criticism

    The third-quarter work summary of Shengquan Township, Mingshui County, Heilongjiang Province, had not been submitted by November 9th. The county party committee criticized this, and the township party branch secretary became anxious, but was too busy to write it himself, so he handed it over to the clerk to write it. The clerk picked up his pen, wrote an opening paragraph, and then had nothing more to say, because he hadn't grasped the situation and didn't have any materials on hand. What to do? He had no choice but to be a "copycat," flipping through publications, bulletins, and circulars, excerpting a paragraph here and copying a few sentences there. The summary was finally pieced together.

    The attitude of lower-level organs in treating summaries in this way is not beneficial to their own work, nor is it beneficial to the leading organs. I wonder if some leading organs consider this problem when they reach out to the lower levels for summary reports?

    “文抄公”的总结
    黑龙江省明水县胜权乡的第三季度工作总结到11月9日仍未上交。县委提出批评，乡总支书记着急了，但又忙得抽不出时间来亲自执笔，于是就交给文书去代写。文书拿起笔来，写了一段开场白，便无话可说，因为他没有掌握情况，而手头又没有材料，怎么办呢？只好做文抄公，翻翻刊物、简报、通报，东摘一段，西抄几句，总结终于拼凑出来了。
    下级机关以这种态度来对待总结，对他们本身的工作没有好处，对领导机关也没有好处。不知有些领导机关伸手向下边要总结报告时是否考虑到这个问题？
