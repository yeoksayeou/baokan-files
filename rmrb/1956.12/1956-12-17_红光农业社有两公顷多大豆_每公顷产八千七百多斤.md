    Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative Has More Than Two Hectares of Soybeans
    Yielding Over 8,700 Jin Per Hectare
    (Our Dispatch) The Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yifeng Township, Lanxi County, Heilongjiang Province, reaped a bumper harvest of soybeans this year on its 216 *mu* of land, with an average yield of over 4,000 *jin* per hectare. Among them, two to three hectares averaged 8,723 *jin* per hectare, setting the highest soybean yield record in the province's history.
    This cooperative adopted comprehensive technical measures this year, including the selection of improved varieties, hand-sowing with new-style farm tools, increased application of manure fertilizer, early thinning of seedlings, and timely weeding. This is the main reason for the increased soybean production this year.
