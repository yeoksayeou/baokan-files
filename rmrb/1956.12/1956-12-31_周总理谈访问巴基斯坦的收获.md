Xinhua News Agency, Dhaka, December 30th: Premier Zhou Enlai told reporters on December 29th that he had three objectives in visiting Pakistan: to seek friendship, to acquire knowledge, and to seek peace. The results were very rewarding. His visit to East Pakistan over the past two days further proved that this visit was fruitful. He said, "I will tell the Chinese people about this."

Premier Zhou Enlai answered questions from reporters while leaning against the railing of the riverboat "Mary Anderson." He had just returned from visiting the Adamjee Jute Mill near Dhaka and was about to go to the Dhaleshwari Cotton Mill. He was reading an English newspaper when a group of Pakistani journalists approached him. Premier Zhou Enlai said to Prime Minister Suhrawardy, "I am surrounded by reporters." Prime Minister Suhrawardy said, "I'll save you." After repeated requests from the journalists, Premier Zhou Enlai still answered their questions.

A Pakistani reporter asked him whether the political understanding reached during this visit was equally successful. The Premier said that the people of both countries wanted peace and friendship. Wherever he went, this view was confirmed. He said that the leaders of the two countries discussed a wide range of issues. Although there were different views, they freely exchanged opinions, and these different views would not hinder the friendship between the two countries.

Premier Zhou Enlai said in response to a question that the relationship between Asian countries was friendly, so he had not considered concluding a Sino-Pakistani non-aggression treaty. He said that China had not concluded such treaties with any Asian country.

A reporter asked: Premier, you once assured India that China would support India's struggle to defend its territorial integrity. Are you willing to make the same assurance to Pakistan? The Premier said that his remarks were made in a general sense. China is willing to offer assurances that it respects the territorial integrity and sovereignty of any country. This is also included within the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence that China supports and which also apply to Pakistan.

A reporter said that China could mediate between India and Pakistan to make their relationship closer because it is friendly with both countries. Zhou Enlai said that he hoped to see India and Pakistan live in harmony and resolve their disputes. He had made efforts in this regard, but what he could do was limited. He could only advise and urge.

Regarding the question of what methods China will use to liberate Taiwan, Zhou Enlai replied, "We will take all possible measures to strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan." However, he reminded reporters that the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair. He then said in English: "Taiwan was, and still is, a province of China." He said that Taiwan had been a province of China for 600 years and was occupied by Japan after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. It was decided during World War II and after the war that Taiwan should be returned to China. After the war ended, the formalities for the return of Taiwan to China were completed.

Answering a reporter's question, he said that he had never heard of Prime Minister Nehru suggesting that Taiwan should be autonomous. But he knew that Nehru had recently said in Ottawa that the idea of creating two Chinas was absolutely unworkable.

A reporter asked if he thought the Taiwan issue and the Kashmir issue were the same. The Premier replied: "I have said many times that I am studying the Kashmir issue and cannot express any opinion at this time."

Someone asked him to talk about the recently published Indo-U.S. joint communiqué. The Premier said in English that he had not studied the issue during his trip because he was completely busy with visits.

The Premier's speech was translated, but sometimes he answered a few sentences in English.

Answering other questions, Premier Zhou Enlai said that the convening of the Second Asian-African Conference should be decided by the Colombo countries and agreed to by other Asian-African countries. He also mentioned that he planned to leave for the Soviet Union on January 7th, and the purpose of this visit had been announced in a statement by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

    周总理谈访问巴基斯坦的收获
    新华社达卡30日电　周恩来总理12月29日对新闻记者们说：他到巴基斯坦来访问共有三重目的，就是找友谊、求知识和寻求和平，结果收获很大。过去两天他在东巴基斯坦的访问进一步证明这次访问收获丰富。他说：“我将把这一点告诉中国人民。”
    周恩来总理倚着内河轮船“玛丽·安德逊号”的栏杆回答了记者们提出的问题。他刚刚访问过达卡附近的阿达姆吉黄麻工厂回来，正要前往达勒斯瓦里棉纺厂。当时他正在看英文报纸，一批巴基斯坦新闻记者前来找他。周恩来总理对苏拉瓦底总理说：“我被记者包围了。”苏拉瓦底总理说：“我来救你。”经过新闻记者们一再要求，周恩来总理还是回答了他们提出的问题。
    巴基斯坦记者问他，这次访问期间取得的政治上的谅解是否一样的成功？总理说：两国人民都要和平和友谊。无论他到那里，这种看法都得到了证实。他说，两国的领导人员讨论了范围很广的问题。虽然存在着不同的看法，但是他们很自由地交换了意见，这些不同的看法不会妨碍两国之间的友谊。
    周恩来总理在回答问题的时候说，亚洲国家之间的关系是友好的，因此他没有考虑缔结中巴互不侵犯条约的问题。他说：中国同任何亚洲国家都没有缔结这种条约。
    一位记者问：总理曾经向印度保证中国将支持印度保卫领土完整的斗争，总理是不是愿意向巴基斯坦作出同样的保证？总理说他那番话是在一般意义上说的。中国愿意提出保证，它尊重任何国家的领土完整和主权。这一点也包括在中国所赞成的、并且也适用于巴基斯坦的和平共处五项原则以内。
    有记者说，中国可以在印度和巴基斯坦之间进行斡旋，使它们之间的关系更密切起来，因为它跟这两国都是友好的。周恩来说，他希望看到印度和巴基斯坦和睦相处，并且解决它们之间的争执。他曾在这方面做了努力，但是他所能做的是有限的。他只能劝告和敦促。
    对于中国将用什么方法来解放台湾这个问题，周恩来回答说，“我们要尽可能采取一切措施争取和平解放台湾”。然而他提请记者们注意，台湾问题是中国的内政。他又用英语说：“台湾过去是，现在还是中国的一个省份。”他说，台湾是中国的一省已经有六百年了，中日战争爆发后，曾为日本所占领。在第二次世界大战期间以及在大战结束以后曾经决定，台湾应该归还中国。战争结束以后履行了台湾归还中国的手续。
    他在回答记者的问题时说，他从没有听说尼赫鲁总理提出过台湾应该自治的建议。但是他知道，尼赫鲁最近在渥太华说过大意是制造两个中国的主张是绝对行不通的这样的话。
    有记者问，他是否认为台湾问题和克什米尔问题是相同的，总理回答说：“我已经说过多次，我正在研究克什米尔问题，现在不能发表任何意见。”
    有人要他谈谈最近发表的印美联合公报，总理用英语说，他在旅行期间，不曾研究过这个问题，因为他完全忙于参观访问了。
    总理谈话是通过翻译的，但是有时候他也用英语回答几句。
    周恩来总理在回答其他的问题时说，召开第二次亚非会议的事情应该由科伦坡国家决定，由其他亚非国家同意。他还谈到，他打算在1月7日动身到苏联去，这次访问的目的已经在中国外交部的声明中宣布过了。
