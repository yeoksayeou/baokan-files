    Who Exactly Is the Typical Example?
  　Shi Yin
    Bureaucrats are not completely out of touch with reality: Firstly, superficial phenomena and hearsay are the reality they encounter; secondly, the reality they want must be consistent with their preconceived ideas, and they turn a deaf ear to realities that are inconsistent with their ideas.

    In September of this year, some leading cadres of the Suzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League thought it was time to criticize erroneous ideas about youth love, so they went to find a "typical example." Wasn't that easy? Sure enough, without much effort, they found one. The Communist Youth League organization of the Suzhou Vegetable Company actually used the method of randomly distributing photos of male comrades to find partners for young people within the company, which resulted in rejection from other units. This was truly a perfect typical case. So, in their report to the Municipal Party Committee, they used this example and wrote it vividly and realistically. They also used this example when reporting to full-time League cadres. Soon, this example spread everywhere. At the meeting of personnel section chiefs of the Third Bureau of the Suzhou Municipal Commercial Bureau, at the study meeting of Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League leading cadres in the commercial system, and at the financial and trade work conference, this example was brought up and the Communist Youth League organization of the Vegetable Company was criticized. The Municipal Party Committee also issued instructions to Party committees at all levels based on the report of the Municipal Communist Youth League Committee, requiring Party committees at all levels to strengthen ideological education for young people.

    It seemed that the Communist Youth League organization of the Vegetable Company should write a profound self-criticism. But this League organization was confused because they had never sent out a single photo, let alone been rejected by other units. The Commercial Bureau Communist Youth League Committee explained to the comrade from the Municipal Communist Youth League Committee who was to report at the meeting of full-time League cadres that this matter was inconsistent with the facts, but it was useless. Because in the eyes of these people, what mattered was not the facts, but that the report must be rich in content. Therefore, the report still used this matter as a typical example. Afterwards, despite further checks by the Communist Youth League organization of the Vegetable Company, which confirmed that it was untrue, and repeated clarifications, reports at various meetings still repeatedly criticized it as a typical example. It was not until the financial and trade system League cadres meeting held on November 17 that the person in charge of the Communist Youth League organization of the Vegetable Company once again raised the issue with the Deputy Minister of the Financial and Trade Department of the Municipal Communist Youth League Committee and demanded an on-the-spot reply. This Deputy Minister gave a brilliant answer: "The fact did not exist, but there was a basis for writing the report at the time." No facts, but a basis – this may be the unique logic of bureaucrats!

    Where did the bureaucrats' so-called basis come from? It turned out that one evening in mid-August, some young people at the Vegetable Company were chatting and casually mentioned that some places in Shanghai were using photos to find partners for young people. So, one League member said: "This method is very good, let our League organization also do it." But when this request was made to the League organization, it was criticized by the company's League organization. Strangely, this matter, which never materialized, became a vivid and typical case as soon as it reached the ears of the leading cadres of the Municipal Communist Youth League Committee.

    This kind of false phenomenon is not isolated in our lives. Not only have there been false materials and false typical examples, but also various false models, false reports, and false achievements. This false phenomenon is inseparable from subjectivism and bureaucracy in leadership. In order to achieve subjectively expected goals, bureaucrats disregard protests against the facts. Of course, the Suzhou Municipal Communist Youth League Committee's use of this false typical case was not intended to be bad, but as an ideological tendency, it is still highly undesirable.

    In order to resist this false phenomenon, we should vigorously promote a leadership style that is honest and seeks truth from facts.

    到底谁是典型？
  　石因
    官僚主义者不是完全不接触实际：的第一，表面现象、道听途说就是他们接触到的实际；第二，他们要的实际必须是和他们头脑中的想法相一致的，对那些和他们的想法不一致的实际则不问不闻。
    今年9月，青年团苏州市委会一些领导干部想到应该批判青年恋爱问题上的错误思想了，于是就去找典型。这还不容易吗？果然不费吹灰之力，就把典型找到了。苏州市蔬菜公司团组织居然用乱发男同志照片的办法来给公司内青年找对象，结果是遭到别的单位的拒绝，这真是再好没有的典型材料了。于是他们在给党市委的报告中用上了这个例子，并且写得逼真生动；又在给团的专职干部作报告时用上了这个例子。不久，这个例子竟到处流传了。在苏州市商业局三局人事科长会议上，在商业系统党、政、工、团领导干部学习会议上，在财贸工作会议上都提出这个例子，对蔬菜公司团组织进行了批评。党市委还根据团市委的报告给各级党委发出指示，要各级党委加强对青年的思想教育。
    看来蔬菜公司的团组织应该写深刻的检讨了。但这个团组织却被搞糊涂了，因为他们实在没有发过一张照片，当然更谈不上什么遭到别的单位拒绝。商业局团委会向团市委那位要在团专职干部会议上作报告的同志说明这件事和事实不符，但没有用。因为在这些人看来，重要的不是事实，重要的是报告内容必须丰富，于是报告中仍把这件事当典型。此后，尽管蔬菜公司团组织进一步作了检查，证实确无其事，一次又一次提出，而各种会议的报告中仍然一次又一次当作典型来批评。直到11月17日召开的财贸系统团干部会议上，蔬菜公司团组织负责同志又一次向团市委财贸部副部长提出并要求当场答复时，这位财贸部副部长才给予了一个极妙的答复：“事实是没有的，但当时写报告时是有根据的。”没有事实，却有根据，这也许是官僚主义者独有的逻辑！
    官僚主义者的所谓根据在那里呢？原来8月中旬一个晚上，蔬菜公司一些青年在聊天中偶然谈到上海某些地方有发照片为青年找对象的事，于是有一个团员说：“这办法很好，要我们团组织也搞搞。”但当这个要求向团组织提出后，就遭到了公司团组织的批评。奇怪的是这样一件根本没有变成事实的事情一传到团市委领导干部耳朵里就变成了活生生的典型材料。
    这种虚假的现象在我们生活中不是个别的。不但出现了假材料，假典型，还出现了各种假模范、假报告、假成绩。这种虚假现象是和领导上的主观主义官僚主义分不开的。为了达到主观预期的目的，官僚主义者是不顾事实的抗议的。当然，青年团苏州市委会运用这个假典型材料，用意并非是不好的，但作为一种思想倾向来说，仍是十分要不得的。
    为了抵制这种虚假的现象，我们应该大力提倡老老实实，实事求是的领导作风。
