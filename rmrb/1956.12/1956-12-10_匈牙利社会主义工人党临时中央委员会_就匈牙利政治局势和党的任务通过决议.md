Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 9th: "People's Freedom Daily" published the resolution of the meeting of the Provisional Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party on the 8th. The meeting was held from December 2nd to 5th, attended by twenty-three people, and discussed the Hungarian political situation and the party's tasks. Kadar made a report at the meeting. Twenty-one comrades spoke during the extensive discussions, exchanges of views, and debates.

The resolution said that the October 23rd incident was caused by four main reasons. The first reason is: the past leadership adopted a sectarian-dogmatic policy, bureaucratic methods, and purely administrative orders in the life of the party, the life of the country, and in the management of the economy. The resolution said that these harmful methods, whether in the life of our party or in the life of the country, led to extremely serious errors and crimes. These methods hindered the expansion of democracy in party life and social life, and seriously undermined the socialist legal system. These methods imposed on the people an economic policy that did not consider the country's economic conditions and hindered the improvement of the living standards of the working people.

The resolution continued, this leadership group failed to recognize and correct its serious errors and crimes. After the historically significant 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, it did not substantially change its behavior and did not pay attention to the resolutions and instructions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU.

Communist Party members and non-Party members, and democratic masses who were angered by serious errors, struggled to correct these errors, but they remained loyal to communist ideas, the socialist social system, and the Hungarian People's Republic.

The participants loyal to socialism in the mass democratic movement clearly demonstrated this before, during, and after the October events.

When analyzing the second reason, the meeting pointed out: within the party opposition that had formed and continuously expanded its influence in the past years, the group headed by Imre Nagy and Geza Losonczy played a major role in the occurrence of the October 23rd incident and its tragic transformation.

When the struggle of this group within the party opposition, together with the entire party opposition, opposed the Rakosi-Gero policy, this group's activities could be considered positive. However, a fundamental change occurred in their activities in the spring of 1956, a transformation in the nature of their activities. They incorrectly moved criticism from inside the party to outside the party, and as a result, reactionaries also joined in this criticism. Therefore, this criticism was distorted; it was no longer the position of Rakosi-Gero that was threatened, but the undermining of the party's prestige, the attack on the working class, and the position and foundation of the Hungarian people's democratic system.

This group within the party opposition did not put forward a positive plan to correct errors, did not draw a line between themselves and the reactionary forces, and one-sidedly attacked the party. This group sided with the counter-revolutionary forces and thus greatly contributed to the outbreak of the counter-revolution.

The third reason is: the main forces in planning and launching the October incident were the fascist Horthy counter-revolutionary forces and the Hungarian bourgeois landlord counter-revolutionary forces. A large part of their forces were carrying out underground activities in the country, while the main forces were gathered and organized in West Germany. The purpose of the Hungarian counter-revolution was to restore the bourgeois landlord system. Since they were defeated in 1945, they have never abandoned this goal. On the contrary, they have been organizing their forces and waiting for an appropriate opportunity to attack our people's democratic system and realize their counter-revolutionary goals.

The resolution said that, finally, international imperialism played a major and decisive role in the Hungarian incident. Of course, their goals were not limited to the Hungarian issue. Not long ago, the whole world saw the provocations organized by international imperialism in Vietnam, Korea, Taiwan, and Suez. These examples prove that international imperialism has not abandoned its attempts to continue to oppress and exploit the people of all countries. They have also not abandoned their plans to provoke local wars and a third world war. International imperialism's intervention in the Hungarian incident, and the role they played in instigating the October incident, are well-known facts. This is proven by the following: Western radio stations in the hands of the imperialists ("Voice of America", "Radio Free Europe") have never stopped their provocative activities attacking the Hungarian People's Republic and attacking its system in the past twelve years. …The sinister role played by the international imperialist groups standing behind the scenes and manipulating from behind the scenes can also be proven by the fact that they have been collecting the remnants of the Horthy army and gendarmerie who fled to the West with the Hitler fascists in West Germany for several years to engage in counter-revolutionary activities.

The purpose of the imperialists was to establish a new hotbed of war in the European continent by helping the counter-revolutionary forces seize power in Hungary.

When assessing the incident that broke out on October 23rd, the meeting pointed out that the counter-revolutionary's purpose was not to correct our mistakes, but to overthrow the people's regime and eliminate the Hungarian People's Republic as a state and its socialist achievements.

The resolution pointed out that the purpose of most of the young people who marched and demonstrated in Budapest on October 23rd was to eliminate the mistakes of the Rakosi-Gero group and consolidate the people's democratic and socialist foundation. However, counter-revolutionary slogans had already appeared in the October 23rd march and demonstration. Nevertheless, the counter-revolution only came out into the open after the ceasefire on October 30th. Military actions could not have been organized by the students, but by experienced counter-revolutionary forces.

The resolution said, as for the fundamental nature of the armed rebellion in Hungary on October 23rd, was it a revolution or a national revolution? Faced with the facts, we have only one answer: it was neither the former nor the latter. It was a counter-revolution. Although we know that the vast majority of the people who participated in this incident in our country, whether in terms of purpose, intention, or feeling, were not counter-revolutionaries, but honest workers, true patriots, and children loyal to the Hungarian People's Republic, we must also tell this truth.

The resolution said: Those who went on strike and participated in demonstrations when the Hungarian People's Republic suffered armed attacks weakened the strength of the Hungarian People's Republic, thereby increasing the chances of counter-revolutionary victory.

The resolution said that when talking about the October events, it must be pointed out that the Nagy government played a bad role in those days. The weakness and continuous rightward leaning of this government facilitated the expansion of counter-revolutionary forces. The following facts are proof: such demands were accepted, for example: arbitrarily declaring unwarranted neutrality, illegally and immediately abolishing the Warsaw Treaty, demanding UN intervention, calling for resistance against the Soviet army that was invited to help defeat the counter-revolutionary forces, allowing counter-revolutionary parties to operate and act recklessly, and declaring the implementation of a so-called multi-party system that was nothing more than abandoning the socialist foundation. The Nagy government, headed by a communist, used its name to conceal from the masses and cover up its inaction in the face of the rampant counter-revolutionary forces and white terror, hindering the masses from recognizing the true scale of the counter-revolutionary danger.

In the part explaining the characteristics of the current situation, the resolution pointed out that the armed offensive of the counter-revolution was crushed on November 4th. After its defeat, the counter-revolution, using words such as "revolutionary" and "worker's" to cover itself, once again called on the working people to strike and resist. When the slogans of strike and resistance were shattered by the rationality of the vast majority of workers, peasants, and intellectuals who yearned for work, longed for normal order and peace, the counter-revolution abandoned these slogans and adopted new ways of struggle.

Now, the counter-revolutionaries are persecuting communists under the pretext of fighting against "Stalinists" and "Rakosiists." Wherever the counter-revolutionaries can take advantage of, they try to squeeze out communists, ordinary honest workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and people with progressive tendencies from state organs, factories, and enterprises.

Any honest person should understand that those purely anti-communist, anti-democratic, and anti-Soviet demands cannot be regarded as revolutionary, national, and democratic demands.

The counter-revolution is spreading disturbing rumors and taking anti-people provocative actions in order to hinder the restoration of stability again, hinder the labor that has already begun, and hinder the consolidation of normal order. The counter-revolution sees that its strength and influence on the masses are weakening day by day, and they are making desperate attempts and struggles to save their failed cause. However, the Hungarian people, who hope for peace and stability, are increasingly clearly seeing that such provocative actions will only hinder the resolution of domestic political problems and problems related to our national sovereignty. Therefore, they are gradually drawing a line between themselves and the counter-revolutionary forces, and are increasingly resolutely cooperating with the domestic armed forces to oppose the counter-revolutionary forces.

Regarding the party's part, the meeting pointed out that the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party carries out its work based on the advanced theory of the world proletariat—the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism—and breaks with all past injustices and bad things. It is the unified, revolutionary party of the Hungarian working class. The foundation of this party is the historically significant resolution passed at the united congress held in 1948, which formed the organizational and political unity of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party.

The Provisional Central Committee of the Party condemns all intentions to undermine the unity of the working class that has been formed in the past.

The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party will creatively apply Marxism-Leninism and build socialism in accordance with Hungary's own characteristics and the requirements of the current history.

The resolution said that the historical task of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party is to establish a socialist system in Hungary. The party should rely on those former members of the Hungarian Working People's Party who adhere to the people's cause and the socialist cause. Those who oppose the principles of internationalism and have nationalist views, and those various elements who pursue fame and gain, cannot be party members.

The party organizations at all levels should follow Lenin's teachings, work on the basis of democratic centralism, and make decisions only after free debate.

The main tasks of the party are: to carry out the work of isolating the enemy, to help the workers' committees and trade unions, to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and to provide assistance to scientific and artistic work.

The resolution said that, in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party believes that the basis of our foreign policy is close friendship and cooperation with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries on the basis of the principles of complete national independence, autonomy, and sovereignty. The party believes that the primary task in our policy is to start holding talks as soon as possible between the leading organs of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the leading organs of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, as well as talks between the Soviet government and the government of the Hungarian People's Republic, in order to adjust the relations between the two countries on the basis of complete equality, independence, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs among socialist countries.

The Provisional Central Committee of the Party recommends that the government prepare, as an urgent task, a plan to formulate solutions to major political and economic problems in accordance with the purpose of the government declaration of November 4th, and to formulate a program to develop life on the basis of uniting all progressive forces in the country and further developing socialist democracy.

　　匈牙利社会主义工人党临时中央委员会
　　就匈牙利政治局势和党的任务通过决议
    发动十月事件的主要力量是国内外反革命势力。十月事件的性质不是革命，而是反革命。纳吉政府不断右倾，便利了反革命势力的扩张。目前反革命的新的斗争方式，是借口对“斯大林分子”和“拉科西分子”进行斗争来迫害共产党人。匈牙利人民越来越坚决地同反革命势力作斗争。党的主要任务是孤立敌人，帮助工人委员会，巩固工农联盟。建议匈苏两国的党和政府就两国关系举行会谈。
    新华社布达佩斯9日电　“人民自由报”8日刊载了匈牙利社会主义工人党临时中央委员会会议的决议。这次会议是在12月2日到5日举行的，出席会议的有二十三人，会议讨论了匈牙利政治局势和党的任务。卡达尔在会上作了报告。有二十一位同志在广泛讨论、交换意见和辩论的过程中发言。
    决议说，10月23日事件是由四个主要原因引起的。第一个原因是：过去的领导在党的生活和国家的生活以及在管理经济中采用了宗派主义——教条主义的政策，官僚主义的方法，单纯行政命令的手段。决议说，这种有害的方法不论在我们党的生活中，不论在国家的生活中，导致了极其严重的错误和罪行。这些方法阻碍了在党内生活和社会的生活中扩大民主，严重地破坏了社会主义法制。这些方法强加给人民这样一种经济政策，这种经济政策没有考虑国家的经济条件，阻碍了劳动人民生活水平的提高。
    决议继续说，这个领导集团没有能够承认和纠正自己的严重错误和罪行。它在有历史意义的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会以后，在实质上没有改变自己的行为，没有重视苏共第二十次代表大会的决议和指示。
    由于严重的错误而激怒了的共产党人和非党人士、民主群众进行了纠正这些错误的斗争，但是他们仍是忠于共产主义思想、社会主义社会制度、匈牙利人民共和国的。
    群众性民主运动中忠于社会主义的参加者们，在十月事件之前、在事件发生的时期和事件之后都很明确地表明了这一点。
    会议在分析第二个原因的时候指出：过去年代中形成并且不断扩大势力的党内反对派中，以伊姆雷·纳吉和格佐·洛松齐为首的集团对于10月23日事件的发生和事件的悲剧性转变起了重大的作用。
    当党内反对派的这个集团的斗争同整个党的反对派一起反对拉科西—格罗政策的时候，这个集团的活动可以认为是积极的。但是1956年春天在他们的活动中发生了一个根本改变，他们的活动的性质的转变。他们不正确地把批评从党内移到党外去，于是反动分子也投入这种批评。因此，这种批评就被歪曲，这时已不是拉科西—格罗的地位受到威胁，而是破坏党的威信、进攻工人阶级和匈牙利人民民主制度的阵地和基础了。
    党内反对派的这个集团没有提出纠正错误的积极计划，没有和反动势力划清界限，片面地一味攻击党。这个集团赞同反革命势力，因此在很大程度上促成了反革命的爆发。
    第三个原因是：在策划和发动十月事件中作为主要力量的是法西斯霍尔蒂反革命势力和匈牙利资产阶级地主反革命势力。他们很大一部分力量是在国内进行地下活动，而主要力量是在西德聚集和组织起来的。匈牙利反革命的目的是使资产阶级地主制度复辟，从1945年他们被击溃以后，他们一刻也没有放弃这一目的。相反的，他们一直在组织自己的力量，等待适当的时机来进攻我们人民民主制度，实现反革命的目的。
    决议说，最后，国际帝国主义在匈牙利事件中起了主要的决定性的作用。当然，他们的目的还不仅限于匈牙利问题。不久以前，全世界都看到了国际帝国主义组织的越南、朝鲜、台湾、苏伊士的挑衅。这些例子证明，国际帝国主义没有放弃他们要继续压迫和剥削各国人民的企图。他们也没有放弃挑起局部性战争和第三次世界大战的计划。国际帝国主义干预匈牙利事件，他们在策动十月事件中所起的作用，是人所共知的事实。这一点从下列情况可以得到证明：帝国主义者手中的西方电台（“美国之音”、“自由欧洲”）过去十二年来一刻也没有停止它们攻击匈牙利人民共和国和攻击它的制度的挑拨活动。……站在幕后，从幕后操纵的国际帝国主义集团所起的罪恶的作用从下列事实也可以证明，在这以前，他们好几年来一直在西德收罗同希特勒法西斯分子一起逃往西方去的霍尔蒂军队和宪兵队的残余分子，用来从事反革命活动。
    帝国主义者的目的是，用帮助反革命势力在匈牙利夺取政权的办法在欧洲大陆建立一个新战争温床。
    会议在估计10月23日爆发的事件时指出，反革命的目的不是纠正我们的错误，而是推翻人民政权，消灭匈牙利人民共和国国家和它的社会主义成果。
    决议指出10月23日在布达佩斯游行示威的大部分青年人的目的是要消灭拉科西—格罗集团的错误以及巩固人民民主和社会主义基础。但是在10月23日的游行示威中已经出现了反革命口号。尽管如此，反革命只是在10月30日停火以后才公开露面的。军事行动不可能是学生们所组织的，而是由经验丰富的反革命力量所组织的。
    决议说，匈牙利10月23日的武装暴动从根本上来说带有什么样的性质，它是革命还是民族革命，对于这个问题，事实摆在我们面前，我们只有一个回答：这既不是前者，也不是后者。这是反革命。虽然我们知道，参加我们国家这次事件的绝大多数人民群众，无论是在目的、意图和感情上，都不是反革命分子，而是正直的劳动者、真正的爱国者、忠实于匈牙利人民共和国的儿女，但是我们也必须说出这种真相。
    决议说：那些在匈牙利人民共和国遭受武装攻击时举行了罢工和参加了示威游行的人，削弱了匈牙利人民共和国的力量，从而增加了反革命胜利的机会。
    决议说，谈到10月事件时，必须指出纳吉政府在这些日子里所起的不良作用。由于这个政府的软弱无能和不断的右倾，便利了反革命势力的扩张。下述事实就是证明：这样一些要求被接受了，例如：擅自宣布毫无保证的中立，非法地、立即废除华沙条约，要求联合国进行干涉，号召反抗被邀请来帮助击溃反革命势力的苏联军队，容许反革命党派活动和胡作非为以及宣布实行无非是放弃社会主义基础的所谓多党制度。以一个共产党人为首的纳吉政府用自己的名义向群众掩饰和掩盖了它对反革命势力和白色恐怖的猖獗无所作为的事实，妨碍群众认识反革命危险的真正规模。
    决议在说明当前局势的特点的那一部分中指出，反革命的武装进攻是在11月4日被粉碎的。反革命在失败以后，用“革命的”、“工人的”这类字眼来掩护自己，又一次号召劳动人民进行罢工和抵制。当罢工和抵制的口号被绝大多数渴望工作、渴望正常的秩序和和平的工人、农民和知识分子的理智碰碎了以后，反革命就放弃了这类口号，而采取了新的斗争方式。
    现在，反革命分子又借口对
  “斯大林分子”和“拉科西分子”进行斗争来迫害共产党人。只要是在反革命有机可乘的地方，他们就设法从国家机关、工厂和企业中排挤掉共产党人、普通的正直的工人、农民和知识分子以及具有进步倾向的人。
    任何一个正直的人都应该懂得，那些纯粹反共、反民主和反苏的要求不能被认为革命的、民族的和民主的要求。
    反革命正在散布扰乱人心的谣言和采取反人民的挑拨行动，以便再来阻挠恢复安定，阻挠已经开始的劳动，阻挠巩固正常的秩序。反革命看到他们对群众的力量和影响日益削弱，它们就进行绝望的尝试和挣扎，想挽救他们已经失败了的事业。但是，希望和平和安定的匈牙利人民越来越清楚地看到，这种挑衅行动只会妨碍解决国内政治问题和同我们的民族主权有关的问题，因而，他们逐渐同反革命势力划清界线，而且越来越坚决地同国内的武装部队合作来反对反革命势力。
    关于党的部分，会议指出，匈牙利社会主义工人党是根据世界无产阶级先进的理论——马克思列宁主义学说来进行自己的工作的，并且同过去的一切不公正和坏的东西决裂。它是统一的、革命的匈牙利工人阶级政党。这个党的基础是1948年召开的、形成了共产党和社会民主党在组织上和政治上的统一的联合代表大会上通过的有历史意义的决议。
    党临时中央委员会谴责一切要破坏过去已经形成的工人阶级统一的意图。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党将创造性地运用马克思列宁主义、按照匈牙利本国的特点和当前历史的要求来建设社会主义。
    决议说，匈牙利社会主义工人党的历史任务是在匈牙利建立社会主义制度。党应该依靠那些坚持人民事业和社会主义事业的匈牙利劳动人民党的过去的党员们。那些反对国际主义原则而有民族主义观点的人，和那些各式各样追求名利的分子是不能做党员的。
    党的各级组织应该遵循列宁主义的教导，在民主集中制的基础上进行工作，并且应在进行自由争辩以后才作出决定。
    党的主要任务是：进行孤立敌人的工作，帮助工人委员会和各个工会，巩固工农联盟，对科学和艺术工作提供帮助。
    决议说，本着无产阶级国际主义精神的匈牙利社会主义工人党认为，我们对外政策的基础是在完全的民族独立、自主和主权的原则的基础上同苏联以及各人民民主国家密切友好和合作。党认为，我们政策中的首要任务就是尽快开始举行苏联共产党的领导机构和匈牙利社会主义工人党的领导机构的会谈，以及苏联政府和匈牙利人民共和国政府的会谈，以便在社会主义国家完全平等、独立和互不干涉内政的基础上调整两国的关系。
    党的临时中央委员会建议政府作为紧急任务来准备按照11月4日政府宣言的宗旨制定解决主要政治问题和经济问题的计划，制定在团结全国进步力量和进一步发展社会主义民主的基础上展开生活的纲领。
