　　The London-Washington Tempest
　　Hu Ping
　　At the end of November, London, shrouded in cold fog and besieged by an oil shortage, was swept by a fierce wave of dissatisfaction with the United States. More than a hundred Conservative members of the British House of Commons jointly proposed a motion expressing "regret over the attitude of the United States, which seriously endangers the Atlantic alliance." Acting Prime Minister Butler exclaimed that the United States was "indifferent to Britain to an unprecedented extent." Foreign Secretary Lloyd admitted that "sharp differences of opinion exist between Britain and the United States regarding the current situation in the Middle East." Associated Press correspondent in London, Provisky, reported on November 29 that "more and more" Britons are dissatisfied with the United States, believing that the United States wants to "drive us (referring to Britain) out of the Middle East and seize our oil."
　　The occurrence of such open quarrels between Britain and the United States, in terms of its immediate cause, is the surfacing of the fierce infighting between the two countries since the Suez Canal issue; more fundamentally, it reflects the irreconcilable contradictions between them in the struggle for colonial interests in the Middle East for many years.
　　Before World War II, the Middle East region was mainly within Britain's sphere of influence. France also had considerable influence. After the war, in the unprecedentedly high tide of national independence among the people of Asia and Africa, Arab countries successively gained independence, France's colonial power in the Middle East was almost non-existent, and Britain's control was also greatly weakened. However, American forces stepped up their involvement, on the one hand becoming the main pillar supporting the British and French colonialists against the people of Middle Eastern countries, and on the other hand being a strong enemy in seizing British and French colonial interests. The waxing and waning of American and British power is most significantly reflected in the oil issue, because this is the main
  target of colonial countries' plunder of the Middle East. In 1938, the Middle East oil production controlled by Britain was five times more than that controlled by the United States, while in 1954, the latter was almost twice as much as the former.
　　The mutual exploitation and mutual squeezing between the United States and Britain in order to compete for the Middle East's oil resources and sales markets, and to compete for control over certain Middle Eastern countries, especially for the leadership of the Baghdad Pact, is well known. In this squeezing, Britain has to rely on the United States to deal with the people of the Middle East, but is inevitably defeated by the United States step by step. Therefore, the British colonialist group has long been very dissatisfied with this. The British conservative force "Daily Mail" shouted on April 4 this year: "Britain and the United States have disputes in the Middle East. Their interests are the same, but they do not have a common policy. Whenever the United States takes action, it is often against Britain."
　　After Egypt took the righteous action of recovering the Suez Canal Company in July this year, this kind of bed-sharing relationship between Britain and the United States in the Middle East became more and more superficial. In order to oppose Egypt and deal with the powerful anti-colonialist forces supporting Egypt, in an attempt to regain the canal and maintain the interests of the colonialists in the Middle East, the contradictions between them once eased, and they joined forces to take consistent actions. However, the United States regarded this incident as a good opportunity to intensify its expansion in the Middle East and squeeze out Britain and France, and thus the contradictions between it and Britain and France became increasingly acute.
　　In the initial stage of the Suez Canal incident, during the period when Britain, France, and the United States jointly passed the so-called "Dulles Plan" at the first London conference, the differences between Britain and the United States began to emerge. Britain and France were eager to recapture the canal at all costs, while the United States preferred to keep the issue in a long-term stalemate, so that it could use the signboard of "peacemaker" to bargain on both sides and obtain more real benefits. Therefore, after the meeting, the "Five-Nation Committee" that took the
  "Dulles Plan" to Egypt to exert pressure "produced divisions," and the American representative Henderson was often "in opposition to" the Commonwealth's Australian Prime Minister Menzies.
　　Around the time of the second London conference in September, the contradictions between the United States and Britain expanded. The United States at that time put forward the so-called "boycott" of the Suez Canal by detouring around the Cape of Good Hope. Its superficial reason was to drag down Egypt with a long-term economic boycott, but its actual intention was obviously also to drag down Britain and France at the same time. Therefore, this plan was rejected by Britain and France, and the set of plans that Britain and France had in mind did not receive the full support of the United States. Although this conference produced the so-called "Users' Association" amidst the disputes between the United States and Britain, the newspapers of the ruling parties in Britain called it a "plan on paper" and were greatly dissatisfied. At this juncture, Dulles made an extremely hypocritical speech on October 2, vaguely accusing Britain and France of colonialism while pretending to be innocent. This aroused great anger in London. The British newspapers retorted that the American "so-called colonialism of defending communism" was no different from "pure colonialism"; the entire history of the Panama Canal was a "vivid example of American colonialism."
　　Amidst the quarrels between the United States and Britain, Britain conducted a series of secret plots with France in September and October, deciding to launch a war independently, attempting to abandon the United States and seize the canal, and expand the power of Britain and France in the Middle East and North Africa. The British Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" and the French right-wing "Le Figaro" both published editorials at the time saying that Britain and France should rely on a "unified Europe" in the future to take care of their "vital interests," and cooperate with the United States where possible, but not necessarily cooperate with the United States. At the same time, Britain also made ambitious plans to become economically independent from the United States. On October 3, Chancellor of the Exchequer Macmillan announced that the British government was considering establishing a "partial free trade zone" with certain Western European countries, forming a "powerful Europe" in order to be in a more advantageous position when dealing with the United States. United Press International sourly reported: This "confirmed the news that Britain is transferring its traditional post-war dependence on the United States to new close economic relations with Western Europe."
　　Paying attention to these plans of Britain before attacking Egypt, it is not difficult to understand the continued two-sided attitude adopted by the United States afterwards and the uproar caused in the US-British relations.
　　When Britain and France launched the war in an adventurous manner, the United States was obviously holding its breath. On the one hand, it was worried that Britain and France would suffer very heavy blows and weaken the strength of the entire imperialist camp, so it openly sheltered Britain and France and prevented the United Nations from taking effective measures to sanction the aggressors. On the other hand, it was unwilling for Britain and France to achieve their goal of occupying the canal and expanding their power alone, because in this way, the leading position that the United States had gained on the canal issue for several months would be lost, and it would also encourage Britain and France to act alone more often behind the United States in the future. Therefore, the United States pretended to maintain "peace" and demanded that Britain and France cease fire and withdraw their troops. This two-pronged approach not only preserved the United States' "peaceful" facade, facilitating its conspiracy to expand its power in the Middle East, but also achieved its goal of giving Britain and France a lesson, making Britain and France further succumb. The American ruling group was quite satisfied with this. "U.S. News & World Report" magazine wrote frankly on November 23: "Britain is not able to act alone. The defeat at Suez proved this." If Britain wants to rely on the United States in the future, "that means Britain must follow the United States in its foreign policy."
　　In fact, the United States does not just force Britain and France to "follow the United States," it also wants to take the opportunity of the unprecedented weakening of the position of Britain and France in the Middle East to intensify its replacement. According to Agence France-Presse, the White House and the State Department are drafting a "new long-term Middle East policy" with the aim of "filling the 'vacuum' created by the actions of France and Britain." This "filling" policy has in fact been implemented in the Baghdad Pact countries. These countries have recently conducted a series of activities with the United States, on the one hand announcing that they will no longer hold Baghdad Pact meetings with Britain, and on the other hand openly "demanding" that the United States formally join the Baghdad Pact. Britain watched as the position it had painstakingly sought in this military group was about to be lost to the United States, and had no choice but to grit its teeth and express "welcome" in order to leave a way to squeeze in again. This is really unspeakable suffering!
　　What annoyed the British ruling group even more was the oil issue. As everyone knows, the United States had long ago openly arranged a so-called "emergency plan" to supply oil to Western Europe, but when Britain and France really needed oil in an emergency, the United States was reluctant to take it out. This aroused the infinite sadness of the British ruling group. They not only mourned the oil fields lost in the Middle East and the Americas, such as Trinidad, to the United States, but also regretted the economic policies they followed the United States in those years.
  The "Daily Express" wrote sadly: Britain's current predicament originated from three things: "The decision in 1945 to accept a US loan (which bound Britain economically), the abandonment of the Abadan refinery in Iran in 1951, and the sale of the Trinidad Oil Company to an American company this year." Another Conservative Party newspaper, "The Sunday Times," said: "American policy is controlled by oil interest groups, and its purpose is to replace Britain's entire power and economic interests in the Middle East with the United States."
　　Of course, this tearing of faces between the ruling groups of Britain and the United States will not break down for a while, because there are still places where they can temporarily exploit each other. Now they are all trying to turn around. According to United Press International, after a period of shouting by Britain and France, the United States has been "frantically conducting behind-the-scenes activities to improve its increasingly cold relations with Britain and France." In recent days, the US government has ordered a large supply of oil to Western Europe and announced that the recent divisions "should not be regarded as" any "weakening or destruction" of the links between the United States and Britain and France. Dulles, who had just left the hospital, quickly announced that he would go to Paris on December 8 to attend the North Atlantic Group meeting and hold special talks with the British and French foreign ministers to mend the rift. The British government and Conservatives have also changed their tune, hoping to "rebuild the Western alliance that has been fragmented." At the same time, a new conspiracy is being carried out between the United States, Britain, and France, attempting to create a tense atmosphere in Syria under the guise of "anti-Soviet and anti-communist" to cover up the contradictions between them.
　　However, the fundamental contradiction between the United States and Britain in the Middle East, especially the contradiction arising from the United States' squeezing out of Britain, has not been eliminated at all. Britain's return to the command of the United States under the soft and hard pressure of the United States cannot exempt it from being dominated by the United States; on the contrary, it will only make it more convenient for the United States to dominate it. Therefore, even if there is some relaxation in the contradictions between the United States and Britain, it will only be temporary, and the struggle between them will become sharper and deeper in the future.

　　伦敦—华盛顿的风波
　　胡平
    11月尾，在寒雾笼罩和石油荒袭击下的伦敦，掀起了一场剧烈的不满美国的风波。英国下议院的一百多名保守党议员，联名提出了“对美国严重危及大西洋联盟的态度表示遗憾”的提案。代理首相巴特勒叫喊美国对英国“冷淡到了无以复加的程度”。外交大臣劳埃德承认英美两国“对于中东目前的局势存在着尖锐的意见分歧”。美联社驻伦敦记者普罗维兹基在11月29日报道说，“越来越多的”英国人对美国不满，认为美国要“把我们（指英国）赶出中东，夺取我们的石油”。
    英美两国之间发生这种公开的争吵，就其近因来说，这是苏伊士运河问题发生以来两国之间激烈的勾心斗角的表面化；说得更根本一些，则是反映了它们多年来在中近东争夺殖民利益的不可调和的矛盾。
    第二次世界大战前，中近东地区主要是英国的势力范围。法国也有相当的势力。战后，在亚非人民空前高涨的民族独立浪潮中，阿拉伯国家纷纷取得独立地位，法国在中东的殖民势力已所余无几，英国的控制地位也大大削弱。但是，美国势力却加紧插手进去，一方面成为支持英法殖民者反对中东各国人民的主要支柱，另方面又是夺取英法殖民利益的劲敌。美英势力的消长，最显著地反映在石油问题上，因为这是殖民国家掠夺中东的主要
  目标。在1938年，英国控制下的中东石油产量比美国控制下的多五倍，而1954年后者反而比前者将近多一倍了。
    美英两国为了争夺中东的石油资源和销售市场，为了争夺对某些中东国家的控制权，特别是对巴格达条约的领导权而进行的互相利用和互相倾轧，这是尽人皆知的。在这种倾轧中，英国既要依靠美国来对付中东人民，又不免于被美国节节击败。因此，英国的殖民主义集团对此早就感到非常不满。英国保守势力的“每日邮报”在今年4月4日叫喊道：“英国和美国在中东有争执。它们的利益是相同的，然而它们都没有共同的政策。只要美国有所行动，那常常是反对英国的。”
    今年7月埃及采取了收回苏伊士运河公司的正义行动之后，英美两国之间在中东的这种同床异梦的关系，表现得越来越表面化了。它们为了要反对埃及和对付支持埃及的强大的反殖民主义力量，以图夺回运河和保持殖民者在中东的利益，它们相互之间的矛盾一度有所缓和，并且联合起来采取一致的行动。但是，美国又把这一事件看作它加紧扩张自己在中东的势力和排挤英法的好机会，因而它和英法之间的矛盾也就越来越尖锐化。
    在苏伊士运河事件的最初阶段，英法和美国在第一次伦敦会议上联合一致地通过所谓“杜勒斯计划”的期间，英美的分歧就开始露头。英法急于不顾一切地夺回运河，而美国却宁可使问题长期僵持不决，以便它打着“和事佬”的招牌向两面讨价还价，取得更多实利。因此，会后拿着
  “杜勒斯计划”到埃及去施加压力的“五国委员会”内部，就“产生了分裂”，美国代表汉德逊同英联邦的澳大利亚总理孟席斯经常“处于对立的地位”。
    在9月间举行第二次伦敦会议的前后，美英矛盾扩大了。美国当时提出了所谓绕道好望角的“抵制”苏伊士运河的计划。它的表面理由是要以长期的经济抵制来拖垮埃及，但实际用意显然也在于同时拖垮英法。因此，这个计划被英法拒绝，而英法所想的一套也得不到美国的完全支持。这次会议在美英争执中虽然搞出了所谓“使用国协会”，但英国当权党派的报纸称它为“纸上计划”而大不满意。正在这个当口，杜勒斯又在10月2日发表了一通极端伪善的谈话，隐约地指责英法为殖民主义而自装清白。这引起了伦敦的十分恼怒。英国报纸反唇相讥说，美国的“所谓防御共产主义的殖民主义”同“纯粹的殖民主义”并没有什么不同；巴拿马运河的全部历史就是美国“殖民主义的鲜明例子”。
    在美英争吵声中，英国在9、10月间就同法国进行了一系列的密谋，决定单独发动战争，企图抛开美国而把运河夺到手里，并且扩张英法在中东和北非的势力。英国保守党的“每日电讯报”和法国右翼的“费加罗报”当时都发表社论说，英法今后要依靠一个“统一的欧洲”来照顾它们的“切身利益”，在可能的情况下同美国取得合作，但不必一定要同美国合作。同时，英国还作出了在经济上也同美国闹独立性的雄心勃勃的打算。10月3日，财政大臣麦克米伦宣布：英国政府正在考虑同某些西欧国家建立“局部的自由贸易区”，构成一个“强有力的欧洲”，以便在同美国打交道时处于比较有利的地位。合众社在报道中酸溜溜地说：这“证实了这样的消息，就是英国正在把它在战后对美国的传统依赖转移到和西欧的新的密切的经济关系上。”
    注意到了英国在进攻埃及以前的这些打算，对于美国以后继续采取的两面态度及其在美英关系中所引起的轩然大波，也就不难理解了。
    在英法冒险发动战争的时候，美国显然是捏了一把汗的。一方面，它担心英法受到非常惨重的打击而削弱整个帝国主义阵营的力量，因此它公然庇护英法，阻止联合国采取有效的制裁侵略者的措施。另一方面，它也不愿意英法达到它们的单独占领运河和扩张势力的目的，因为这样一来，美国几个月来在运河问题上所取得的主导地位就会丧失，而且还将鼓励英法以后更多地背着美国单独行事。所以，美国就假装维持“和平”，要求英法停火和撤兵。这种两面做法，既保全了美国的“和平”面具，便利它在中东扩张势力的阴谋，又达到了它的给英法一点厉害看看的目的，使英法进一步屈服。美国统治集团对此颇为满意。“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志在11月23日坦率地写道：“英国不能够单独行事。苏伊士的大败，证明了这一点。”今后英国如果要依靠美国，“那就意味着英国在外交政策上必须要跟从美国”。
    事实上，美国并不止于迫使英法“跟从美国”，它还想趁着英法的地位在中东空前地削弱的机会，加紧取而代之。据法新社报道，白宫和国务院正在拟订“新的长期中东政策”，目的是“为了填补法国和英国的行动所造成的‘真空’。”这种“填补”政策，事实上已经在巴格达条约国家实行了。这些国家最近已同美国进行了一系列的活动，一面宣布它们将不再同英国在一道举行巴格达条约的会议，一面又公开“要求”美国正式加入巴格达条约。英国眼看着自己煞费苦心在这个军事集团中所谋得的地位行将丧失给美国，而又不能不硬起头皮表示“欢迎”，以便留一点再挤进去的后路。这真是有苦难言！
    更使英国统治集团恼怒的是在石油问题上。大家知道，美国早就公开地安排好了一个供应西欧石油的所谓“紧急计划”，但在英法真正需要石油的紧急关头，美国却又迟迟不肯拿出来。这引起了英国统治集团的无限伤感。他们不但悼念中东和美洲的特立尼达等处丧失在美国手里的油田，并且懊悔当年追随美国的经济政策。
  “每日快报”伤心地写道：英国当前的困境起源于三件事：“1945年决定接受美国贷款（这笔贷款使英国在经济上受到束缚），1951年放弃了伊朗的阿巴丹炼油厂，再就是在今年把特立尼达石油公司出售给一家美国公司。”另一家保守党报纸“星期日泰晤士报”说：“美国的政策是被石油利益集团控制着的，它的目的是要由美国来代替英国在中东的全部势力和经济利益”。
    当然，英美统治集团这种撕破脸皮的争吵，一时是还不会闹翻的，因为它们之间暂时还有互相利用的地方。现在它们都在设法转弯。据合众社报道，在英法一阵叫喊之后，美国已在“拚命进行幕后活动以改善它同英法之间日趋冷淡的关系”。这些天来，美国政府已下令向西欧大量供应石油，并且宣布最近的分歧“不应该被认为”是美国和英法的联系的任何“削弱或破坏”。刚出医院的杜勒斯赶紧宣布要在12月8日到巴黎参加北大西洋集团的会议，并同英、法外长特别会谈以弥缝裂痕。英国政府和保守党人也改变了口风，希望“重建已经四分五裂的西方联盟”。同时，美英法之间又在进行新的合谋，企图打起“反苏反共”的幌子在叙利亚制造紧张空气，以掩盖它们之间的矛盾。
    但是，美英两国在中东的根本矛盾，特别是美国排挤英国所产生的矛盾，一点也没有消除。英国在美国的软硬兼施的压力下重新回到美国的指挥棒下，并不能使它免于受美国的宰制；相反地，只会使美国更便利地宰制它。因此，美英之间的矛盾即使有某些和缓，也只会是暂时的，它们之间的斗争今后将会更尖锐、更深刻。
