The Twenty-ninth Production Team of the Xinguang Agricultural Cooperative in Nanling County, Anhui Province, is a very outstanding production team. This team has the most young people and quickly adopts advanced production technologies. This year, under the guidance of the district agricultural technology extension station, the team's experiment group conducted many interesting and meaningful experiments for increasing production.

	1,830 Jin Per Mu
This year, the experiment group used two mu of land to experiment with three-season continuous cropping (generally, only two seasons are planted in a year). The three crops were barley, mid-season rice, and late-season rice. According to the general view, continuous cropping is difficult. However, because the experiment group closely grasped the production season, the experiment was completely successful and a bumper harvest was obtained. The average yield of the three crops was 1,830 jin per mu, a high-yield record that had not been seen locally before.

	Eight Sweet Potatoes Weigh 100 Jin
"Victory No. 100" sweet potato is a good variety newly promoted locally, but the cooperative members initially did not believe that this variety had a high yield. The experiment group specially cultivated eight "Victory No. 100" sweet potato plants. They prepared the land very loosely, applied sufficient fertilizer, and later erected supports for the sweet potato vines. At harvest time, they attracted many cooperative members. They dug out more than twenty large sweet potatoes that they had never seen before, weighing a total of 100 jin. The largest one weighed 13 jin and 2 taels. The young people couldn't close their mouths from smiling. The cooperative members competed to see them, saying, "A person can't eat such a big sweet potato in a day!"

	Two Planting Methods, Two Different Harvests
During the late-season rice transplanting, the young people in the experiment group used two different planting methods in a 1.3 mu field. Half of the field was planted with small seedlings at a spacing of six inches square, and the other half was planted with large seedlings at a row spacing of three by six inches. After transplanting, there was no difference in the management of this field. However, at harvest time, the two different planting methods showed their differences. The half planted with large, densely planted seedlings yielded 340 jin of rice, while the other half only yielded 260 jin.

The young people in the experiment group also conducted some other experiments this year. Some of the experiments were successful, and some failed. They have developed a strong interest in studying agricultural production technology and plan to continue experimenting next year.

　　有趣的试验
　　新华社记者　石正章
    安徽省南陵县新光农业社的第二十九生产队，是一个很出色的生产队。这个队青年人最多，接受先进生产技术很快。今年这个生产队的试验小组在区农业技术推广站的指导下，作了很多有趣的、对增产有意义的试验。
        每亩一千八百三十斤
    今年试验小组用两亩地试验了三季连作（一般是一年种两季）。三季作物是大麦、中稻和晚稻，按照一般人的看法，连作是有困难的。可是，由于试验小组紧紧抓住生产季节，使试验完全成功，获得了丰收。三季作物平均每亩收到一千八百三十斤，这样的高产记录在当地还没有见过。
        八棵甘薯重一百斤
      “胜利百号”甘薯是当地新推广的良种，社员们开始不相信这个品种的产量高。试验小组就专门培植了八棵“胜利百号”甘薯。他们把地整得很松软，施足肥料，后来又把甘薯藤架起来。在收获的时候，吸引了很多社员。他们从地里挖出了二十多个从来没有见过的大甘薯，一共有一百斤重。最大的一个重十三斤二两。青年们笑得嘴也合不拢。社员们争着看，都说，这么大的甘薯一个人一天也吃不完！
      两种栽法、两样收成
    在晚稻插秧的时候，试验小组的青年们在一块一亩三分的田里，一半采用六寸见方的小株栽插法，另一半采用三六寸株行距的大株栽插法。栽秧以后，他们对这块田的管理工作没有什么不同。但是在收获的时候，两种不同栽法就显出高低来了。大株密植的一半打了三百四十斤稻谷，而另一半只打了两百六十斤。
    试验小组的青年们今年还作了其他的一些试验。所有的试验，有的成功了，有的失败了。他们对于研究农业生产技术，已经发生浓厚的兴趣，准备明年继续试验。
