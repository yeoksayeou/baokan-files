In previous years, many leading organizations would become extremely busy at the end of each year. Busy with what? Busy convening a series of various conferences to summarize work and arrange for the coming year's work. Some of these meetings were indeed necessary, but others were not so urgent, and some were mainly held to spend the year-end surplus funds. A large number of grassroots cadres and lower-level cadres were summoned to the city to attend countless meetings; as a result, the work below fell into a state of no one being responsible and no one leading. By the time the cadres returned from the city after attending a series of meetings, the losses in work had become irreparable. The primary task currently facing rural work cadres is to lead winter production; everything that is detrimental to production should be avoided as much as possible.

The Neijiang County Party Committee discovered this problem early on and, in accordance with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy and opposing bureaucracy, resolutely corrected this shortcoming. This was truly a great thing to do! Can other regions with the same problem also be determined to take the same measures as the Neijiang County Party Committee?

　　能不能都像内江县委这样做？
    往年，每到年终，许多领导机关就大大忙碌起来了。忙些什么？忙于召开一连串各种各样总结工作和布置来年工作的会议。有些会确实是需要的，但是也有些会并不是那么迫切的，还有些会主要是为了花掉年终结余的经费才开的。大量的基层干部、下级干部被召集进城去参加数不尽的会议；结果，下边的工作就陷于无人负责、无人领导的状态。等到干部开完一连串的会从城里回来，工作中的损失已经无法挽回了。当前摆在农村工作干部面前的首要工作就是领导冬季生产；凡是不利于生产的事，都应该力求避免。
    中共内江县委及早发现了这个问题，并且根据增产节约、反对官僚主义的精神，坚决地纠正了这种缺点。这实在是作了一件大好事！其他地区有同样问题的单位，能不能也像内江县委那样下定决心采取同样的措施呢？
