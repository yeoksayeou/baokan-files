　　Armenia
　　The Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic was established on November 29, 1920. In the thirty-six years since, Armenia has developed from a backward region into a Soviet republic with advanced industry, collective agriculture, and a highly socialist culture.

　　Before the revolution, Armenia had almost no industry of its own; even industrial products like matches were imported. Now it has factories for chemicals, machinery manufacturing, and electrical machinery manufacturing, enterprises for non-ferrous metals and building materials, as well as light industry and the food industry. The factories in the capital, Yerevan, alone produce more than 400 kinds of industrial products, including machine tools, automobile tires, compressors, cables, transformers, turbines for rural hydroelectric power stations, woolens, silks, canned goods, bicycles, and clocks. Leninakan is also an industrial center, with a cotton textile complex and a meat processing complex. The copper mine in Alaverdi is well-known in several republics of the South Caucasus. Four hydroelectric power stations have been built on the Razdan River, which flows from Lake Sevan in the mountains, and four more will be built in the future. During the Soviet era, Armenia's electricity production has increased rapidly, and calculated per capita (the national population is 1.6 million), it has exceeded that of France and Italy. The republic's annual electricity production is now equal to the entire electricity production of Tsarist Russia in 1913, and has reached 1,200 times that before the Armenian Revolution.

　　Armenia's collective agriculture is also well-developed. By the end of 1955, there were 900 collective farms, 48 state-owned farms, and 58 machine tractor stations in the country, using 4,700 tractors. In the mountainous areas of the republic, there is developed animal husbandry and agriculture, with animal husbandry income accounting for one-third of the total agricultural product income. Grains, vegetables, cotton, sugar beets, and tobacco are abundant on the irrigated land of the plains. Vineyards and orchards are one of Armenia's main sources of wealth, with delicious pears, plums, peaches, and grapes supplying the entire Soviet Union. Armenian wine is famous throughout the Soviet Union.

　　Before the revolution, 90% of Armenia's residents were illiterate. There were no institutions of higher learning or scientific institutions, and no secondary agricultural schools. Now, Armenia has become a nation where everyone is literate. There are 1,700 general schools and 16 institutions of higher learning in the country. The Republic's Academy of Sciences includes thirty scientific research institutes and experimental stations. The Burakan Observatory, established last October, is one of the largest observatories in the world. 298,100 people study in general schools, 17,000 study in technical schools and other secondary specialized schools, and 19,400 study in institutions of higher learning. There are 2,516 scientific workers in the country, including 133 with doctorates and 1,193 with associate doctorates.

　　In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, Armenia's total industrial output value will increase by about 70%, of which the Republic's total industrial output value will increase by 60%. The construction of the Sevan-Razdan hydroelectric power station will be completed, and construction of the Tatev hydroelectric power station with a generating capacity of 100,000 kilowatts will begin. In agriculture, by 1960, grain production will increase by 50% compared to 1955, and orchard industry, grape cultivation, and cotton planting will be further developed. 　Zhang Ye

　　亚美尼亚
    亚美尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国是1920年11月29日成立的。三十六年来，亚美尼亚已经从一个落后的地区发展成为一个拥有先进工业、集体农业和高度社会主义文化的苏维埃共和国了。
    在革命以前，亚美尼亚几乎没有自己的工业，连火柴这样的工业品都是输入的。现在已有了化学、机器制造、电机制造等工厂、有色金属、建筑材料等企业以及轻工业和食品工业了。光是首都埃里温的各个工厂就出产四百多种工业产品，包括机床、汽车轮胎、压缩机、电缆、变压器、农村水力发电站用的涡轮机、呢绒、丝织品、罐头、自行车和钟表等。列宁纳坎也是一个工业中心，这里有棉纺织联合厂和肉类联合厂。阿拉维尔迪的铜矿在南高加索几个共和国里非常著名。在从高山上的谢凡湖流出来的拉兹丹河上已经建成四个水电站，将来还要建筑四个。在苏维埃政权年代，亚美尼亚的电力生产增加的很快，按人口平均计算（全国人口一百六十万人），已经超过了法国和意大利。现在共和国的电力年产量已经等于1913年沙皇俄国全国的电力产量，而且达到亚美尼亚革命前的一千二百倍。
    亚美尼亚的集体农业也很发达，到1955年底全国有九百个集体农庄、四十八个国营农场和五十八个机器拖拉机站，使用着四千七百台拖拉机。在共和国的高山地区有着发达的畜牧业和农业，畜牧业的收入占全部农产品收入的三分之一。在平原的灌溉土地上盛产着谷物、蔬菜、棉花、甜菜和烟草。葡萄园和果园是亚美尼亚的主要富源之一，美味的梨子、李子、桃子和葡萄供应着全苏联。亚美尼亚的葡萄酒是闻名全苏联的。
    革命以前，亚美尼亚的居民90％都是文盲，没有一所高等学校和科学机关，也没有一所中等农业学校。现在，亚美尼亚已经成了一个人人识字的国家了。全国有一千七百所普通学校，十六所高等学校。共和国的科学院包括三十个科学研究所和实验所。去年10月在布尔干建立的天文台是世界最大的天文台之一。在普通学校学习的有二十九万八千一百人，在技术学校和其他中等专业学校学习的有一万七千人，在高等学校学习的有一万九千四百人。全国有两千五百一十六个科学工作人员，其中有博士一百三十三人，副博士一千一百九十三人。
    在第六个五年计划中，亚美尼亚的整个工业总产值约增加70％，其中共和国工业总产值增加60％，完成谢凡—拉兹丹水电站的建筑工程并动工建筑发电能力为十万千瓦的达杰夫水电站。在农业方面，到1960年谷物生产要比1955年增加50％，并进一步发展果园业、葡萄种植业和植棉业。　章　叶
