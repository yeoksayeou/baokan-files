    Clay sculpture is one of the most folk-traditional arts. In the past, it mostly involved sculpting statues of gods and Buddhas in temples, almost all of which were "painted sculptures" (with colors applied to the clay figure). Folk clay sculptors are generally skilled in both sculpting and painting, as well as making paper crafts, paper cuttings, lacquer paintings, etc., making them versatile artists. Some artists specialize in making children's toys.
    There are many folk clay sculptors in Zhejiang, with young artists Chen Heting and Nan Shiren from Yueqing County being the most prominent. Chen Heting's "The Reconciliation of General and Prime Minister," "Reading to Grandpa," "Old Woman Interpreting Poetry," and "Du Fu" are all excellent works that have received high praise domestically. His works feature realistic figures, with accurate anatomical proportions and particular attention to portraying the inner emotions of the characters. He previously sculpted Buddha and deity statues, and painted door gods and murals.
    Nan Shiren's works are known for their dynamic expressions. The figures he sculpts are vividly portrayed through appropriate exaggeration. His set of sculptures depicting Wu Song, including "Wu Song Fighting the Tiger," "Blood Splattered on the Mandarin Duck Tower," "Making Havoc at Feiyunpu," and "Drunkenly Beating Jiang Menshen," reaches a high standard of folk clay sculpture. Some compare him to the "Clay Figure Zhang" of the North. (Image attached)

　　浙江的民间泥塑
　　葛克俭　贺鸣声
    泥塑是最富有民间传统的艺术之一。过去大都塑造庙宇的神像和佛像，差不多都是“彩塑”（在泥胎外涂以色彩）。民间泥塑艺人一般都能塑能画，也能做纸扎、剪纸、漆绘……等，可说多才多艺。有一部分艺人则专做儿童玩具。
    浙江的民间泥塑艺人很多，现以乐清县的年青艺人陈鹤亭和南式仁最为突出。陈鹤亭的“将相和”、
  “读给爷爷听”、“老妪解诗”、“杜甫”，都是非常优秀的作品，在国内获得很高的评价。他的作品形象真实，人体解剖、比例都很准确，尤其注意人物内心感情的刻划。他过去就是塑佛像、神像和画门神、壁画的。
    南式仁的作品以表现动态见长。他塑造的人物形象，经过适当的夸张，表现得很生动。他所作“武松打虎”、
  “血溅鸳鸯楼”、“大闹飞云浦”、
  “醉打蒋门神”等一套描写武松的组塑，达到民间泥塑的高度水准。有人把他和北方的“泥人张”媲美。（附图片）
