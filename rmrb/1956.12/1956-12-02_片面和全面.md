Editorial Notes:

    One-Sidedness and All-Sidedness
    The assessment of much of our work can be described as: great achievements, many shortcomings.
    If we only see “many shortcomings” and forget “great achievements,” then we are seeing only the trees and not the forest, only the small and forgetting the large. We will then exaggerate the shortcomings, causing us to lose confidence in progress and discouraging our courage to overcome the shortcomings.
    If we only see “great achievements” and forget “many shortcomings,” thinking that our work is perfect and flawless, then we will become arrogant, complacent, and careless; shortcomings will increase, and small mistakes will develop into big mistakes.
    In recent years, we have also had great achievements and many shortcomings in our work regarding ethnic minorities. This nationwide inspection of ethnic minority work illustrates this point.
    The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is the same in terms of ethnic minority work. However, before the inspection, some comrades only saw “great achievements” and believed that Xinjiang's ethnic minority work was done very well and that there were no problems. The results of the inspection proved that these comrades' ideas were wrong. Why were these comrades' ideas wrong? It's because they were not all-sided. This lesson is particularly worth learning.

    片面和全面
    对我们很多工作的估计，都可以说是：成绩很大，缺点很多。
    如果只看到“缺点很多”，忘掉了“成绩很大”，就是只见树木不见森林，只见小的，忘了大的。也就会夸大缺点，使我们丧失前进的信心，打击我们克服缺点的勇气。
    如果只看到“成绩很大”，忘掉了“缺点很多”，以为我们的工作十全十美、美玉无瑕，也就会使我们骄傲自满、麻痹大意；缺点就会增加，小错误就会发展成大错误。
    几年来，我们在民族工作方面，也是成绩很大，缺点很多的，这次全国民族工作大检查就说明了这个问题。
    新疆维吾尔自治区在民族工作方面，也是这样。但是，在检查以前，有些同志就只看到“成绩很大”，认为新疆的民族工作作得很好，没有什么问题。检查的结果，证明这些同志的想法是错误的。这些同志的想法为什么会错呢？就是不全面。这点教训特别值得吸取。
