Xinhua News Agency, Zhaojue, December 14th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Yu Jingqi reports: The Second Sub-Delegation of the Central Comfort Delegation, currently conducting慰问 (comfort) activities throughout Liangshan, has been dispatched to Zhaojue, Xide, Yuexi, Puxiong, Meigu, and Jinyang counties since November 26th, deeply engaging in慰问 (comfort) activities.

	The first group of personnel arrived in Butuo, the largest flatland in Liangshan, on the afternoon of December 12th. On this fertile plain, stretching over ten *li* in length and width, colorful arches were erected everywhere, and red flags fluttered in the wind. A welcoming crowd of ten thousand people and constant cheers filled the area with joyous scenes.

	Butuo is the main settlement area for the "Songdi people" among the Yi people (who differ somewhat in language, clothing, and customs from other areas). On the evening of the 11th, when news of the approaching Comfort Delegation spread, people immediately sent the joyous news to villages across the plain overnight. Upon the arrival of the Comfort Delegation personnel, people played the "Shana" (similar to a *suona* horn), beat drums and gongs, and young women wore their favorite clothes to welcome the delegation. Hai Rixia Zhi, a sixty-eight-year-old man, carrying a colorful flag he had made himself, met the Comfort Delegation and shouted "Mao Zhuxi Wawaku!" (Long live Chairman Mao!) along with the masses.

	These days, the Comfort Delegation has held慰问 (comfort) meetings and various symposiums in various locations, bringing the concern of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao to every corner of Liangshan, and presenting gifts, winter clothing, grain, and commemorative badges to people from all levels of the Yi people and cadres of all ethnic groups working in Liangshan.

	When the Comfort Delegation visited people from all walks of life, people reported their current living conditions to the representatives of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao. In Zhaojue, when Deputy Head of the Delegation Wang Yifu and others visited the Nanping Agricultural Production Cooperative, the first established in the county, members brought out the iron chains used by the slave owners in the past to rule them, and also displayed the results of their labor this year. This advanced agricultural cooperative, composed of more than thirty households of former slaves and semi-slaves, saw a 30% increase in total grain production this year compared to last year. More than a dozen former slave households have moved into new homes, and each person's income is equivalent to 64 yuan, whereas in the past they had nothing.

	The Comfort Delegation's慰问 (comfort) activities in various parts of Liangshan have encouraged the broad masses, cadres, and upper-level figures. People have proposed plans to continue completing democratic reforms and developing mutual aid and cooperation. In Fucheng District, Meigu County, many farmers are applying to join agricultural cooperatives, some are even building houses near the agricultural cooperatives, and some primary cooperatives have already proposed transitioning to advanced cooperatives.

    彩坊到处耸立　红旗迎风飘动
    凉山彝族人民欢迎慰问团
    新华社昭觉14日电　新华社记者于竞祁报道：正在凉山各地慰问的中央慰问团第二分团，从11月26日起，已经分路到了昭觉、喜德、越巂、普雄、美姑和金阳等县，深入地展开了慰问活动。
    第一路人员12日下午到达凉山最大的平坝——布拖。在这个长宽各十多里的沃野上，这天到处耸立着彩坊，飘动着红旗。一万人的欢迎行列和不断的欢呼，使这里充满了欢乐的景象。
    布拖是彝族人民中“松地人”（他们在语言、服装、风俗习惯上和别处有些差异）的主要聚居区。11日晚上，当慰问团即将到来的消息传出后，人们立刻把喜讯连夜送到平坝上各个村庄。慰问团人员一到，人们吹起“沙那”（类似唢呐），打起锣鼓，姑娘们穿着心爱的衣裳，来迎接慰问团。六十八岁的老人海日夏之拿着自己买布做的一面彩旗，见到慰问团后和群众一齐高呼“毛主席瓦瓦库！”（毛主席万万岁）。
    这些日子，慰问团在各地举行了慰问大会和各种座谈会，把中央和毛主席的关怀带到了凉山各个角落，把礼品、寒衣、粮食和纪念章赠送给彝族各阶层的人民和在凉山工作的各族干部。
    慰问团访问各阶层人民的时候，人们把自己今天的生活状况报告给中央和毛主席的代表。在昭觉，当副团长王一夫等在这个县最先建立的南坪农业生产合作社访问的时候，社员拿出了过去奴隶主统治他们时期所用的铁链，也展览了他们今年劳动的成绩。这个由三十多户过去的奴隶、半奴隶组成的高级农业社，今年粮食总产量比去年增加了30％，有十几户过去的奴隶搬进了新居，每个人的收入折合人民币六十四元，而过去他们一无所有。
    慰问团在凉山各地的慰问，鼓舞着广大群众、干部和上层人士。人们纷纷提出了继续完成民主改革和发展互助合作的计划。在美姑县附城区，许多农民都在申请加入农业社，有的还把房子修到农业社附近，有的初级社已经提出了转为高级社的要求。
