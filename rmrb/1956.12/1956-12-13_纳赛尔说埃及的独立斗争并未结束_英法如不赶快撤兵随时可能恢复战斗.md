Xinhua News Agency, December 12th dispatch from Cairo: Egyptian President Nasser said on December 10th, when meeting with a reporter from the Italian weekly "Epoca," that if British and French troops do not accelerate their withdrawal, fighting could "resume at any time" in Egypt.

Nasser said, "Egypt accepted the ceasefire order because Egypt loves peace." He pointed out, "The United Nations resolution did not set conditions for the withdrawal of troops from Egypt, and our country has been too tolerant. However, there is a limit to patience."

Nasser accused France and Britain of being determined to seize the Suez Canal twelve years before the old Suez Canal Company's lease was due to expire. He also said, "Britain and France would have tried to seize the Suez Canal at any cost after the expiration of the International Suez Canal Company's lease anyway."

Nasser recalled that he had accepted the principle of freedom of navigation on the canal, as well as the six principles agreed upon by the United Nations with the consent of Egypt, France, and Britain. He then pointed out that, in any case, the conspiracy of our enemies became clear before the start of explicit negotiations on this issue. They wanted to recapture the Suez Canal at all costs. Negotiations were originally scheduled to begin on October 29th, but Britain and France had already decided to launch an offensive on that day. Originally, we were willing to accept any new agreement as long as it reflected the spirit of the 1888 Convention, which declared the canal to be ours.

Nasser also said that Egypt's struggle for independence would not end with the withdrawal of foreign troops, as it was also an economic issue.

Nasser said, "Egypt does not want to establish an Arab empire. It also does not want to be a guiding nation. Our position between East and West is that of a country that hopes to remain neutral and is willing to be friendly with all countries."

He said, "The British are trying to stimulate Baghdad to take action to change the direction of Syria, but Syria does not want to give up its independence. Like us, it is determined to fight anyone to defend its independence."

When talking about the relationship between Egypt and the Soviet Union, Nasser said that this relationship "has no political or ideological content." He said: "Egypt does not participate in any bloc and is always ready to fight to prevent dangerous influences. Communist ideology is contrary to the fundamental system of the Egyptian government. We do not accept any law other than Islamic law."

When answering a question about Egypt's purchase of weapons from socialist countries, Nasser said, "No one can deprive Egypt of the right to arm itself and defend its borders."

Nasser said that in order to obtain weapons, I initially made requests to "our traditional allies." But they refused our requests, while at the same time arming Israel behind our backs under the pretext of creating a necessary balance of power.

He said: "According to their view, creating a balance of power meant supplying Israel, with only two million residents, with enough weapons to equip six Arab countries with a population of forty million."

He continued, "We asked Britain, France, and the United States for weapons, but we were unable to obtain them due to the conditions they imposed. The answer we always received was: if we join their bloc, we can get weapons. They put forward insulting conditions, and we refused these conditions without hesitation."

Nasser said: "We were forced by the threat from Israel on the border and were determined to get weapons from anyone who was willing to give them to me; our contract with Czechoslovakia was arranged in this way on a purely commercial basis. There is no such thing as communist weapons or non-communist weapons. If these weapons are in Egypt's hands, they are Egyptian weapons."

When talking about the construction of the Aswan Dam, Nasser said that this issue was very similar to the issue of weapons supply. He said, "They linked the issue of aid for the construction of the Aswan Dam to conditions that could turn Egypt into a colony."

The "Epoca" reporter asked him whether Egypt would now be willing to accept US aid for the construction of the dam. Nasser replied: "In the current situation, this issue cannot be discussed."

### 纳赛尔说埃及的独立斗争并未结束  英法如不赶快撤兵随时可能恢复战斗

    纳赛尔说埃及的独立斗争并未结束
    英法如不赶快撤兵随时可能恢复战斗
    新华社12日讯　开罗消息：埃及总统纳赛尔12月10日在接见意大利周报“时代报”记者的时候说，如果英法军队不加速他们的撤退的话，“随时都可能”在埃及“恢复战斗”。
    纳赛尔说，“埃及接受了停火命令，因为埃及爱好和平。”他指出，“联合国的决议没有对从埃及撤兵提出条件，我们的国家一直是太过于宽容了。但是，忍耐是有它的限度的。”
    纳赛尔指责说，法国和英国决心在旧苏伊士运河公司租借期再有十二年就要结束的时候强占苏伊士运河。他还说，“英国和法国在国际苏伊士运河公司租借期满以后，本来无论如何也是会不惜任何代价设法夺取苏伊士运河的。
    纳赛尔回顾说，他已经接受了运河航行自由的原则，以及联合国在埃及、法国、英国三国的同意下所商定的六项原则。接着他指出，无论如何，我们的敌人的阴谋在关于这个问题的明确的谈判开始以前就清楚起来了。他们想不惜一切代价夺回苏伊士运河。谈判原定在10月29日开始，但是英国和法国当时已经决定要在那一天发动进攻。本来，不论是什么新的协定，只要它能够反映宣布运河归我们所有的1888年公约的精神，我们都愿意接受。
    纳赛尔还说，埃及争取独立的斗争在外国军队撤退以后并不会随之结束，因为它也是一个经济问题。
    纳赛尔说，“埃及并不想建立阿拉伯帝国。它也不想当指导国家。我们在东西方之间的地位，就是希望保持中立并且愿意同一切国家友好的那样一个国家的地位。”
    他说，“英国人企图刺激巴格达采取行动来使叙利亚改变方向，但是叙利亚不想放弃自己的独立。它像我们一样，也决心为了维护自己的独立而同任何人进行斗争。”
    纳赛尔在谈到埃及和苏联的关系的时候说，这种关系“没有任何政治内容和意识形态内容”。他说：“埃及不参加一切集团，并且永远准备好为防止危险的影响而进行斗争。共产主义意识形态是同埃及政府的根本体制相矛盾的。我们除了伊斯兰的法律以外不接受任何其他法律。”
    纳赛尔在回答关于埃及向社会主义国家购买武器的问题的时候说，“谁也不能剥夺埃及武装自己和保卫自己边界的权利”。
    纳赛尔说，为了取得武器，我最初是向“我们传统的盟友”提出要求的。但是他们却拒绝了我们的要求，同时却又在创造必要的力量对比均势的借口下背着我们武装以色列。
    他说：“根据他们的看法，造成力量对比的均势就意味着要把足可以装备拥有四千万居民的六个阿拉伯国家的武器供给仅有二百万居民的以色列。
    他接着说，“我们要求英国、法国和美国给我们武器，但是由于他们提出的条件，我们没有能够得到。我们得到的回答总是：如果我们参加他们的集团，我们就能得到武器。他们提出了侮辱性的条件，我们毫不犹豫地拒绝了这些条件。”
    纳赛尔说：“我们受到边境上以色列的威胁的逼迫，并且决心从愿意把武器给我的任何人那里得到武器；我们同捷克斯洛伐克的合同就是这样在纯粹商业性质的基础上安排签订的。根本就没有什么共产党的武器还是非共产党的武器。这些武器如果在埃及手里，那就是埃及的武器。”
    纳赛尔在谈到关于建设阿斯旺水坝问题时说，这个问题同武器的供应问题非常相似。他说，“他们把援助阿斯旺水坝建设工作的问题同一些能够使埃及沦为殖民地的条件联系在一起。”
    “时代报”记者问他，埃及现在是否愿意接受美国对水坝建设提供的援助。纳赛尔回答说：“在目前这种情况下，不能讨论这个问题。”
