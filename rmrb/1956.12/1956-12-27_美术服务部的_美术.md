    The "Art" of the Art Service Department

    The business policy of Beijing's "Art Service Department" seems to have changed. Lately, not only has business been declining and customers becoming increasingly scarce, with the sales staff behind the counter often outnumbering the shoppers, but the "Art Service Department" has almost turned into a general store. Many items that are not crafts or art pieces are also displayed there. A few months ago, they even displayed mud-made "sugar-coated haws" in strings on the counter. These things are neither edible nor aesthetically pleasing. Who would spend money to buy them for appreciation? Not long ago, they also sold wax-made "Chinese cabbage," "sausages," "shrimp," and so on, as well as plaster mirror frames inscribed with phrases like "Happy Life" and "Mutual Respect and Love" and decorated with red hearts. To speak of art, these things are truly inferior, and there are plenty of them in Dong'an Market. Why does the "Art Service Department" need to recommend them?

    Customers have many feelings about the "artistic viewpoint" of the Art Service Department. They believe that the Art Service Department should not display these unaesthetic things. Some have expressed their opinions in the suggestion book. However, the manager of the Art Service Department not only does not value these opinions but instead thinks that these customers are "self-righteous" and "deliberately causing trouble."

    We hope that the manager of the "Art Service Department" will realistically and humbly consider the customers' opinions!

    美术服务部的“美术”
    北京“美术服务部”的业务方针大约是改变了。近来不但营业日益下降，顾客日见稀少，经常站在柜台后的售货员，比买东西的人要多得多，而且现在的“美术服务部”，几乎已经变成了一个杂货摊。有许多东西，根本不是工艺品或美术品，也陈列在那里。前几个月，竟把泥做的“糖葫芦”一串一串地摆在柜台上，这种东西既不能吃，又不好看，有谁肯花钱买去欣赏呢？不久以前还销售过蜡做的“白菜”、“灌肠”、“虾子”等等，以及写着“生活幸福”、“互敬互爱”等一类词句和画着红心的石膏镜架。这些东西，要论艺术，实在是低劣的，而且东安市场有的是，何劳“美术服务部”来推荐呢？
    顾客们对美术服务部的“美术观点”，颇有感慨，他们认为美术服务部不应该把这些并不美的东西陈列出来，有的在意见簿上提出了意见。可是美术服务部的经理，不仅不重视这些意见，反而认为这些顾客“自以为是”、“故意捣蛋”。
    我们希望“美术服务部”的经理实事求是地虚心考虑一下顾客的意见！
