Also Speaking of "Inevitable"
    Liu Xiaoru

To also speak of "inevitable" is because someone has already spoken of it. Having already spoken of it, why speak again? To speak again and again, wouldn't that be tiresome? Whether "inevitable" is "inevitable" is inherently a tiresome matter, and a tiresome matter must be addressed with tiresome words; this too can be considered a case of "inevitable," right?

On October 29th, page seven of the "People's Daily" published an article titled "Speaking of 'Inevitable.'" The author, Comrade Yu Chi Kui, criticized certain anti-rebellion cadres for treating non-inevitable matters as "inevitable," pointing out that these "leading cadres who always say 'inevitable'" are in fact "careless," "superficial," and "quite leisurely." He further pointed out that these types of leading cadres "anticipated 'inevitable' from the start" and did not "strive for 'avoidance'" during execution, with the result that "of course some people will be 'not avoided.'" Amidst his lamentations, the author recommended Ouyang Xiu's "Tomb Inscription of Old Man of Longgang" to the "inevitability theorists," hoping they could learn something from old Mr. Ouyang. These intentions are good. However, the author's intentions extend beyond mere gifts; it seems there is also a desire to voice grievances for some comrades who were "not avoided" in the anti-rebellion struggle.

It is only natural for comrades who have been "not avoided" to feel aggrieved, and it is also only natural to voice those grievances. Only by voicing grievances can peace of mind be restored, and only then can comrades be restored to their former camaraderie. Unfortunately, the grievances voiced in the article "Speaking of 'Inevitable'" cannot bring peace of mind to the "not avoided" comrades; on the contrary, it will likely exacerbate their resentment.

How can this be seen?

This article serves as proof. The article "Speaking of 'Inevitable'" speaks only of man-made "inevitable," and contrived "inevitable," not of objective inevitable, and real inevitable. Putting all "inevitable" in quotation marks makes one unable to see that there are truly inevitable things in this world.

It is regrettable that in the anti-rebellion struggle, some good comrades were indeed "not avoided" under circumstances that were not man-made "inevitable" or contrived "inevitable." However, in the end, they were all relieved of the "not avoided" injustice under the policy of "not wronging a single good person." For these comrades, it is necessary and proper to listen humbly to their grievances and even offer them apologies. However, it is also necessary to explain to them the objective and real inevitability of the situation in a matter-of-fact way. Only in this way can grievances be transformed into understanding, and estrangement into unity. If not, telling them that there is no such thing as inevitability in the world, and that the so-called "inevitable" is merely the result of "quite leisurely" people being "careless" and "superficial" in their reckless actions, the good intentions of speaking out for the wronged comrades will have what consequences? If feelings are hurt beforehand, will they not be left with lingering resentment afterward?

As the saying goes: "One does not know difficulty until one has experienced it." Those who have not "experienced" it, may think there is nothing "difficult" about it?

"What's so 'difficult' about it?" When speaking, it is "inevitable" to sound a bit flippant, or perhaps even a little "smug"! Judging heroes by success or failure is relatively easy, because success or failure has already become a foregone conclusion. To clear out hidden counter-revolutionaries while ensuring that not a single counter-revolutionary escapes the net and that not a single good person is wronged is probably more difficult than being wise after the event, isn't it!? "In a major movement (such as the anti-rebellion movement), it is sometimes inevitable that there will be some excessive struggles that hurt the feelings of our own people, or even wrongly search their pockets." (The article "Speaking of 'Inevitable'" quoted a passage from the "Wenhui Daily," which is also borrowed here.) Indeed, not only the anti-rebellion is like this, but which political activity is like the Nevsky Prospekt in St. Petersburg?

So, it would seem that the comrades who have suffered the injustice of being "not avoided" were all inevitable. This is as one-sided as saying that Chengdu is not inevitable. Here, it is only necessary to distinguish which aspects of the wrongful struggle are universal and which are individual. To continue to dwell on it would probably be a bit tiresome, wouldn't it?

Comrade Yu Chi Kui believes that "more courtesy is never a fault," and bestows upon everyone the "inevitable" in quotation marks, along with the article "Tomb Inscription of Old Man of Longgang." In doing so, one feels that he is somewhat rich and courteous, but not so matter-of-fact. In my opinion, gift-giving should also distinguish between objects, otherwise, "undeserved reward," people "are also not always able to refuse."

    也说难免
    柳小如
    也说难免，是因为有人已经说过“难免”。既已说了，何必再说？一说再说，岂不啰苏？“难免”不“难免”本是一桩啰苏事，啰苏事不得不用啰苏话来说，这也算一桩“难免”吧？
    10月29日“人民日报”第七版登了一篇“说‘难免’”，作者尉迟葵同志批评了某些肃反干部，把并非难免之事看作“难免”，指出这些“开口就是‘难免’的领导干部”，其实是“粗枝大叶”，“浮光掠影”，“安闲得很”。并指出：此种领导干部是“早就预期着‘难免’”，执行之中又没有“力求‘能免’”，其结果是“当然就有人‘不免’”。作者在感慨之余，给“难免论者”推荐了欧阳修的“泷冈阡表”一文，期望他们从老欧阳先生那里学习一点东西。这番意思是好的。不过，作者意不止此，除了一些馈赠之外，看来还有为一些在肃反斗争中受到“不免”的同志鸣不平的意思。
    被“不免”的同志，心有不平，乃是理所当然，不平则鸣，也是理所当然。鸣了不平才能心平气和，同志之间才能复好如初。可惜，“说‘难免’”一文所鸣的不平，却并不能使“不免”的同志心平气和，不仅如此，恐怕是心更不平，气更不和。
    何以见得？
    此文为证。“说‘难免’”一文说的尽是人为的“难免”，臆构的“难免”，而非客观的难免，真实的难免。把难免都打上了括号，这就使人看不到世间还有真正难免之事。
    令人遗憾的是，肃反斗争中确实有些好同志，在不是人为的“难免”，不是臆构的“难免”下，被“不免”了一番。但是，最后都在“不冤枉一个好人”的政策下，解除了“不免”之屈。对于这些同志，要虚心听取他们申屈，乃至向他们赔情道歉，这都是必要的、应该的。不过，也要实事求是地向他们说清楚客观的、真实的难免之所在。只有如此，才能化委屈为谅解，化隔阂为团结。若不是这样，告诉他们天下并无难免之事，所谓“难免”也者，只不过是“安闲得很”的人，“粗枝大叶”、“浮光掠影”地乱整而已。为受屈的同志说一说出气儿的话，用心是好，可是，如此说法，后果又将如何？既伤感情于先，难道还要让他们耿耿在怀于后吗？
    俗语说得好：“事非经过不知难”。没有“经过”的人，以为此中有甚“难”事？
    “又有什么‘难’在哪里”？说起话来就“难免”风凉一些，或者说，也有点“飘飘然”吧！成败论英雄，这是比较容易的，因为成败已成定局。肃清暗藏反革命分子，要做到既不使一个反革命分子漏网，又不冤枉一个好人，恐怕比事后诸葛亮，要不容易些吧！？“在大运动中（例如在肃反运动中），有时发生一点过火的斗争，伤了自己人的感情，甚至错误地搜了自己人的腰包，这也是难免的。”（“说‘难免’”一文从“文汇报”上引的一段话，这里也借来一用）正是，何独肃反如此，哪桩政治活动，是像彼得堡的涅瓦大街呢？
    如此说来，受了“不免”之屈的同志，都是在所难免的了。这同说成都不是难免是一样的片面。这里只要分清楚在错斗的情况中，哪些是普遍的，哪些是个别的，就行了。还要纠缠下去，恐怕真有点啰苏了吧？
    尉迟葵同志以为“礼多人不怪”，统统赠以打括号的“难免”二字，另附“泷冈阡表”一文。这么一来，倒使人觉得似乎有点富而好礼，并不那么实事求是了。我看，赠礼也要分清对象，否则，“无功受禄”，人家“也不是一概推委不得的”。
