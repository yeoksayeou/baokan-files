The Second Guangdong Province Representative Meeting on Rural Production for Dependents of Overseas Chinese was held in Guangzhou from December 12th to 19th. The more than 400 representatives attending the meeting had broad representation. Model figures and advanced workers accounted for more than half, including those who have always loved labor and actively participated in production; those who originally could not or were unwilling to participate in labor, but have now learned and actively participate in agricultural production; and those who, after changing their status from landlords and rich peasants, have worked hard in production, were enthusiastic about collective interests, and gained the trust of the masses. At the meeting, the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee commended and rewarded various model figures and advanced workers.
