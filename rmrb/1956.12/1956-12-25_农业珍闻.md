Agricultural Anecdotes

    Huangzhou Radishes with a Yield of 30,000 Jin Per Mu
    The Huangzhou radish, produced in Changqi (Huangzhou), Huanggang County, Hubei Province, which is famous throughout the country, has had a bumper harvest this year. Wang Jicheng of Yejiashui Township planted 1.5 mu of radishes, creating a new record of an average yield of 30,000 jin per mu. More than 100 mu of radishes cultivated by the third cooperative of the Changjiang Agricultural Cooperative and the first cooperative of the Jiangling Agricultural Cooperative achieved a large-scale high yield of 10,000 jin per mu.
    Huangzhou radishes have the advantages of being sweet, crisp, fragrant, and juicy. They are delicious whether eaten raw, cooked, or pickled. Every year after the harvest, in addition to local farmers eating them and supplying them to industrial cities such as Wuhan and Huangshi, they are also sold to Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, Guizhou, Nanjing, and other places.

    Large Guanggan Oranges Weighing One Jin and Two Liang
    At around 9:00 AM on December 9th, at the farmers market in Chengguan Town, Rongchang County, Sichuan Province, many people were vying to buy large Guanggan oranges that they had never seen before. The largest weighed one jin and two liang, and the smallest weighed fourteen liang. A load of Guanggan oranges was sold out in less than twenty minutes. People who bought the oranges said while eating them, "They are really big and delicious!"
    Liang Deqing, a member of the Hongtaiyang Agricultural Cooperative in Liansheng Township, District 1 of the county, was the one who brought the Guanggan oranges to the market. Six years ago, he planted two Guanggan saplings by the ditch in front of his house. One of them bore particularly large fruits this year. Before picking them, the heavy oranges almost broke the branches. He picked more than two hundred large Guanggan oranges from this one tree alone. According to Liang Deqing, he is also planning to plant some more Guanggan saplings next year by the fertile ditch. (Liu Xianwen)

    A Large White Pig Weighing 1,200 Jin
    The Xugou Purchasing Station of the Qingxu County Food Company in Shanxi Province raised a large white pig weighing 1,200 jin. (See the picture below.)
    This large white pig was raised from a piglet born from a cross between a Chinese sow and a Soviet boar weighing 800 jin. This pig was originally raised by Zhang Rouer in Mengfeng Village for nine months and weighed 200 jin. After the Xugou Purchasing Station bought it back in November 1955, it decided to continue raising it. During the feeding process, it was fed five jin of bran, four jin of sorghum skin, four jin of black beans, and some other feed every day. A 200-jin white pig, after the patient feeding of the breeders, was raised into a large fat pig weighing 1,200 jin in one year, gaining an average of more than two jin of meat per day. If calculated at the local price of six jiao and two fen per jin of pork, it can earn more than one yuan and three jiao and nine fen a day. After deducting the cost of feed at five jiao and one fen per day, a net profit of more than eight jiao and eight fen can be obtained every day.

    亩产三万斤的黄州大萝卜
    闻名全国的湖北黄冈县长圻?（黄州）出产的黄州大萝卜，今年获得了丰收。叶家路乡汪吉成种的一亩五分萝卜，创造了每亩平均高产三万斤的新纪录，长江农业社第三社和江陵农业社第一社培植的一百多亩萝卜，达到了亩产一万斤的大面积丰产。
    黄州大萝卜，具有甜脆、味芳、多汁等优点，无论生食、熟食，还是腌食，都很可口。每年收下来，除当地农民食用和供应武汉、黄石等工业城市外，还远销江西、安徽、湖南、贵州、南京等地。（经四）
    一斤一两重的大广柑
    12月9日上午九点多钟，四川荣昌县城关镇的菜市场上，很多人在争先恐后地购买从未见过的大广柑。其中，最大的有一斤一两重，最小的也有十四两重。一挑广柑，不到二十分钟，就被购买一空。买到广柑的人边吃边说：“真是又大又好吃！”
    挑广柑上市的是这个县一区连生乡红太阳农业社的社员梁德清。六年以前，他在屋子前面的阳沟边上，栽了两棵广柑树苗，其中一棵，今年结的果实特别大。在采摘以前，沉甸甸的柑子几乎把树枝压的要折断了。光这一棵树，就摘了两百来个大广柑。据梁德清说，他还准备明年在肥沃的阳沟边上再栽植一些广柑树苗。　（刘宪文）
    一千二百斤重的一头大白猪
    山西省清徐县食品公司徐沟收购站饲养了一头一千二百斤重的大白猪。（见下图）
    这头大白猪是由一头中国种的大母猪同一头体重八百斤的苏联大公猪杂交生下的猪娃养成的。这头猪原来在孟封村张肉儿家养了九个月，体重达到二百斤。1 955年11月，徐沟收购站收购回来以后，决定继续饲养。在饲养过程中，每日喂谷糠五斤，高粱皮四斤，黑豆四斤和一些别的饲料。一头二百斤重的白猪，经过饲养员的耐心饲养，一年内就养成了一头一千二百斤重的大肥猪，平均每日长肉二斤多。如果按当地每斤猪肉价六角二分计算，一天就可以收入一元三角九分多，除去每日饲料折价五角一分，每天可取得纯利八角八分多。
