　　Xinhua News Agency report: In the rural areas of the Honghe Hani Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province, where land reform was completed through peaceful negotiation, every township now has a grassroots organization of the Communist Party of China. Currently, 194 Party branches have been established in the rural areas of the entire region.
    Since this spring, the Honghe Frontier Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has carried out Party building work in rural areas in a planned way, in conjunction with land reform. As of early December, more than 2,200 Hani farmers and farmers from over ten other ethnic minorities have joined the Chinese Communist Party. All ethnic minorities within the autonomous region now have their own Communist Party members. These ethnic minority Communist Party members are all farm laborers, poor peasants, and a small number of middle peasants who have raised their class consciousness and met the requirements for joining the Party in the struggle for land reform. Many of them are production models, hunting experts, and militia heroes.
    Now, the Party branches in each township are leading the peasants to comprehensively develop production and steadily carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

　　红河哈尼族自治区乡乡有了中共支部
　　新华社讯　云南省红河哈尼族自治区以和平协商方式完成土地改革的农村中，乡乡都有了中国共产党的基层组织。目前全区农村已建立了一百九十四个党支部。
    今年春季以来，中共红河边疆工作委员会结合土地改革，有计划地在农村进行了建党工作。到12月上旬为止，已经有二千二百多名哈尼族和其他十几个少数民族农民加入中国共产党。自治区境内所有的少数民族都有了本民族的共产党员。这些少数民族共产党员，都是在土地改革斗争中提高了阶级觉悟，具备了入党条件的雇农、贫农和少数中农。他们中间有许多人是生产模范、打猎能手和民兵英雄。
    现在各乡党支部正领导农民全面发展生产，稳步开展互助合作运动。
