Xinhua News Agency, December 15th: The first National Customs Advanced Workers Representative Meeting opened in Beijing on the 15th. The 111 representatives attending the meeting include outstanding workers from the ranks of customs anti-smuggling officers, tax collectors, statisticians, sailors, service personnel, and administrative staff, representing six ethnic groups including Han, Korean, Dai, Uyghur, Hani, and Xibe.

Lin Haiyun, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade and Director of the General Administration of Customs, spoke at today's meeting. Lin Haiyun said: Since the founding of the nation, customs has made tremendous achievements in supervising and managing goods, passengers, and international postal items entering and leaving the country, and in collecting tariffs. At the same time, it has also uncovered a large number of smuggling cases and political sabotage cases, and exposed many cargo accidents that caused losses to import and export materials. Through the above work, customs has played a positive role in accumulating national construction funds and safeguarding socialist construction. After citing the vivid deeds of several advanced workers present as examples, Lin Haiyun pointed out: From the personal experiences of these comrades, it can be seen that in carrying out various customs tasks, we must improve our political vigilance and develop a high degree of political responsibility for protecting state materials. We must have a serious and meticulous approach to investigation and research, and a pragmatic work style. Otherwise, it is impossible to do our job well. Lin Haiyun hopes that the advanced workers will always remember what Chairman Mao said: "Modesty helps one to go forward, whereas conceit makes one lag behind." Be modest and prudent, lead the masses, continue to maintain and develop the work style of hard work and simple living in border areas, the emphasis on investigation and research, and the pursuit of truth from facts. Oppose extravagance and waste, oppose being high above the masses, ignoring the difficulties of the masses, and not cherishing the property of the masses. Give full play to the political responsibility of protecting state materials and do a better job in customs work.

    海关先进工作者代表会议开幕
    据新华社15日讯　全国海关第一次先进工作者代表会议15日在北京开幕。出席会议的一百十一名代表，包括着汉、朝鲜、傣、维吾尔、哈尼、锡伯等六个民族的海关查私员、征税员、统计员、船员、服务员和行政工作人员中的优秀工作者。
    对外贸易部副部长兼海关总署署长林海云在今天的会上讲了话。林海云说：建国以来，海关在监督管理进出国境的货物、旅客、国际邮递物品和征收关税等方面都有巨大成绩，同时还查获了大量的走私案件和政治性破坏案件，揭发了许多起使进出口物资遭受损失的各种货运事故。通过上述工作，海关在积累国家建设资金，保卫社会主义建设等方面都起了积极的作用。林海云在举例表扬若干到会的先进工作者的生动事迹后指出：从这些同志的亲身经验可以说明，我们在执行各项海关工作时，都必须提高政治警惕性和发扬保护国家物资的高度政治责任心，具有认真细致的调查研究和实事求是的工作作风，否则是不可能做好工作的。林海云希望先进工作者永远记住毛主席说的：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”，谦虚谨慎，带动群众，继续保持和发扬在边疆地区艰苦朴素坚持工作和重视调查研究实事求是的工作作风，反对铺张浪费现象，反对高高在上，不关心群众困难，不爱护群众物品的官僚主义。要发挥保护国家物资的政治责任心，更好地做好海关工作。
