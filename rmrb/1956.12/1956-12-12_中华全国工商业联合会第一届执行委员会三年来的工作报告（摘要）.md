Xinhua News Agency, 11th – Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, Rong Yiren, delivered a "Report on the Work of the First Executive Committee Over the Past Three Years" at today's congress. The abstract is as follows:

I. Work Over the Past Three Years

Assisting state organs in implementing the policy of peaceful transformation, uniting and educating the vast number of industrialists and businessmen to actively accept socialist transformation, and representing the legitimate interests and reasonable demands of industrialists and businessmen are the basic tasks of our Federation of Industry and Commerce. Over the past three years, our association and organizations at all levels have mainly carried out the following tasks based on this basic mission.

Regarding Business Guidance Work

Over the past three years, the business guidance work of our association and organizations at all levels has developed with the gradual deepening of socialist transformation, mainly promoting and helping the vast number of industrialists and businessmen embark on the path of state capitalism.

This work includes: (1) Guiding private industrial and commercial enterprises to initially enter the orbit of state capitalism. After the closing of the First Congress of Members, our association and organizations at all levels, on the one hand, widely publicized the general task of the state during the transition period, and on the other hand, actively guided private industrial and commercial enterprises to gradually embark on the path of state capitalism.

(2) Carrying out work to increase production and practice economy, and improve business management. We cooperated with relevant departments to gradually carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy in the industrial sector, and also actively carried out work to improve business management in the commercial sector, creating the necessary conditions for further accepting transformation.

(3) Assisting state organs in implementing the principle of "overall consideration, comprehensive arrangement, and active transformation." We conducted relatively specific investigation and research in several cities and industries, and provided some opinions on overall arrangements. We made necessary reflections and consultations on issues existing in commercial network adjustment, shop mergers, factory mergers and reorganizations, allocation of processing and ordering tasks, labor-hour profits, specification standards, as well as taxation policies and joint state-private operation. The results of the coordinated arrangement by relevant departments further expanded processing and ordering. Major industrial sectors in some regions began to adopt the principle of "the large leading the small, the advanced leading the backward," and carried out factory mergers and joint operations based on production cooperation relationships. More retail businesses were incorporated into the form of distribution and agency sales. Some handicraft industries and small merchants and peddlers began to be organized, and various forms of mutual assistance and cooperation developed to some extent. This prepared favorable conditions for the overall joint state-private operation and cooperation.

(4) Promoting private industrial and commercial enterprises to implement overall joint state-private operation and cooperation.

During the Second Meeting of the First Executive Committee, Chairman Mao invited all the committee members to a discussion and gave cordial guidance, which helped everyone understand the laws of social development and grasp their own destiny. At the same time, the government clearly announced the policy of "overall arrangement and comprehensive planning." After the meeting, organizations at all levels conducted layer-by-layer transmission, greatly boosting the confidence of industrialists and businessmen in taking the socialist road, and they requested joint state-private operation. Under the influence of the high tide of agricultural cooperation, in January 1956, a high tide of overall joint state-private operation and cooperation was set off throughout the country.

(5) Promoting industrialists and businessmen to participate in socialist competition. According to incomplete statistics from ten provinces and three directly administered municipalities, a total of more than 380,000 industrialists and businessmen participated in the competition in the third quarter of this year, with more than 49,000 winning honorary titles and more than 27,000 receiving material rewards. This is a socialist education with practical significance and a model for industrialists and businessmen to contribute to socialist construction after the overall joint state-private operation.

Regarding Propaganda and Education Work

Over the past three years, we have conducted several comprehensive and major socialist future education campaigns in light of the situation of socialist transformation and the process of ideological development in the industrial and commercial circles.

First, after the announcement of the general task of the state during the transition period, we focused on ideological education on accepting socialist transformation on the ideological basis of the Common Program.

Second, when the draft constitution was promulgated, industrialists and businessmen in various regions actively participated in the discussion and enthusiastically put forward their opinions. After the official promulgation of the constitution, we again focused on conducting ideological education on abiding by the law and resolutely taking the socialist road for the vast number of industrialists and businessmen.

Third, after the Second Meeting of the First Executive Committee of this Association, this Association promoted organizations at all levels to immediately convey Chairman Mao's teachings to the broad industrial and commercial circles across the country in a thorough and in-depth manner. This was the most extensive and in-depth transmission, basically achieving household awareness and penetrating into people's hearts.

Fourth, since the past three years, regular learning organizations and various lectures have continued to develop, and the number of participants has continued to increase. Many regions have set up lectures or report meetings specifically for small merchants and peddlers and small industrialists and businessmen. As of September 1956, many provincial-level cities in the three municipalities directly under the Central Government, such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, and twenty-one provinces have held short-term training courses. According to incomplete statistics, more than 33,000 industrialists and businessmen have participated in full-time study. Some prefectural-level cities and county federations of industry and commerce have also held short-term training courses. This type of short-term training course is still continuing to develop and is widely welcomed by industrial and commercial circles. Various regions have established regular senior, intermediate, and primary learning organizations more widely according to the different levels of industrialists and businessmen, and the number of participants in learning has expanded even more, reaching nearly one million people.

While carrying out socialist future education, we have also frequently and repeatedly conducted education on patriotism and law-abiding for the vast number of industrialists and businessmen, and organized industrialists and businessmen to study domestic and international political current events and important national policies and laws. We have also continuously organized industrialists and businessmen to participate in various patriotic movements and social activities, including major ones such as: participating in the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons, opposing the US-Chiang treaty, supporting the liberation of Taiwan, and supporting the Egyptian people's struggle against colonialism. In the past year, international activities have increased rapidly. This association and many people from industrial and commercial circles have participated in various international reception work, received visits from international friends, and some have also participated in foreign visiting delegations and international conferences.

Regarding Organizational Work

Over the past three years, our association has urged all regions to establish and improve organizational structures and reorganize trade associations in accordance with the principles stipulated in the Organizational Rules, so that the organizational structures can better adapt to the requirements of the state's general task during the transition period. As of October 1956, among the organizations directly under this association, twenty-one provinces, two autonomous regions, and three municipalities directly under the Central Government have formally established federations of industry and commerce, and one province has established a preparatory committee. Among the one hundred and fifty-seven provincial-level cities and seven league-level cities, autonomous region-level cities, and autonomous prefecture-level cities, except for individual district-level cities, formal organizations have been established. Among the two thousand one hundred and ten counties, organizations have been established in a total of one thousand nine hundred and twenty-eight. Under the county federations of industry and commerce, branches, offices, or industrial and commercial groups are generally established according to specific circumstances. In some areas, trade associations have been adjusted and reorganized according to the organizational system of professional companies, further giving play to their professional role.

Over the past three years, a large number of key members of industrial and commercial circles have participated in the work of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, serving as committee members and group leaders, and have been tempered in their work over the past few years. More than 100,000 people have served as committee members and group leaders in organizations at all levels, playing a leading role, a model role, and a bridging role in socialist transformation.

The full-time staff of our association and organizations at all levels totals approximately 40,000 people. Their hard work over the past few years has made beneficial contributions to the work of the Federation of Industry and Commerce.

Over the past few years, although our work has achieved certain accomplishments, there are also shortcomings. As far as the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce is concerned:

First, in terms of business guidance, there is a lack of timely and specific guidance and assistance to organizations at all levels. There is a lack of in-depth research and analysis of the materials reflected by organizations at all levels, and therefore, there is more reflection and less suggestions to state organs.

Second, in terms of ideological education, we do not have a thorough understanding of the ideological changes of industrialists and businessmen, and the work of conducting education targeting ideology is not done enough. The work of organizing learning cannot meet the requirements of all parties, and a large part of small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen have not had the opportunity to learn regularly. The learning materials are too general and cannot meet the requirements of various types of industrialists and businessmen.

Third, we have lacked a serious attitude in studying and resolving the problems that exist in organizational work for the past few years. For example, provincial-level work is new work, and everyone lacks experience. We have not conducted in-depth research and summary. We have also not specifically studied how trade associations can better play a professional role and how they can divide and cooperate with district federations of industry and commerce. The reason for the above shortcomings is, on the one hand, that our investigation and research work is not in-depth and timely enough, and the work of summarizing experience is not done enough, so we cannot put forward specific opinions and methods; on the other hand, we are not yet accustomed to collective leadership, the links between superiors and subordinates are not enough, and we have not invited organizations at all levels to discuss together in a timely manner, so we have not been able to give full play to the collective strength in our work.

II. Several Experiences in Our Work in Assisting the State in Implementing the Policy of Peaceful Transformation

In the process of promoting the vast number of industrialists and businessmen to actively accept socialist transformation, the Federation of Industry and Commerce has played its due role. According to the practice of the past few years, we have realized that in order to guide industrialists and businessmen to actively embark on the socialist road, we must do the following aspects of work well. These are: (1) We must rely closely on the leadership of the Party; (2) We must represent the legitimate interests and reasonable demands of industrialists and businessmen; (3) We must conduct persuasive education targeting ideology; (4) We must cultivate key members and give play to their leading, exemplary, and bridging roles.

Rely Closely on the Leadership of the Communist Party of China

To carry out socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, the Party has adopted a policy of peaceful transformation. Correctly implementing the policy of peaceful transformation is the basic condition for promoting industrialists and businessmen to actively accept transformation. Over the past few years, due to the correct implementation of the Party's policies, industrialists and businessmen have not only set off a high tide of overall joint state-private operation with gongs and drums, but are also gradually transforming into working people.

To correctly implement the Party's policies, we must rely closely on the leadership of the Party. The Party's leadership is the guideline for our work. If we deviate from it, we will lose our direction in our work. In the process of realizing socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, the Party has adopted a peaceful policy suitable to China's national conditions, and has made necessary steps and deployments, so that private industrialists and businessmen have the possibility to accept socialist transformation. We closely follow the steps and deployments stipulated by the Party to carry out our work, and we will achieve twice the result with half the effort and smoothly complete the task.

In the process of implementing the policy of peaceful transformation, the Party often educates us and adopts a consultative approach, through our organizations at all levels, to absorb reflections and opinions from the vast number of industrialists and businessmen, so that the reasonable demands and opinions of our industrialists and businessmen can be properly handled. This makes us realize that the Party often cares for and takes care of our industrialists and businessmen in order to develop production. The Party's leadership makes us feel close and warm.

In order to do our work well, we must also obtain the guidance of people's committees and CPPCC committees at all levels, as well as the support and assistance of other relevant departments. Therefore, we must establish close contact with all relevant departments.

Represent the Legitimate Interests and Reasonable Demands of Industrialists and Businessmen

Representing the legitimate interests and reasonable demands of industrialists and businessmen is an important link for the Federation of Industry and Commerce to do its work well and unite the vast number of industrialists and businessmen. In the process of socialist transformation, the state adopts a method of gradually buying out private means of production, the purpose of which is to give industrialists and businessmen a necessary time to accept transformation with peace of mind. Correctly implementing the policy of redemption to realize the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises is in line with the greatest interests of the people of the whole country. Therefore, representing the legitimate interests and reasonable demands of industrialists and businessmen, and enabling industrialists and businessmen to actively accept socialist transformation, is also consistent with the interests of the people of the whole country.

In socialist transformation, industrialists and businessmen have their own interests and demands. Whenever we appropriately represent the legitimate interests of industrialists and businessmen and promptly reflect the situation and opinions, and after the state's arrangements, appropriately take care of the reasonable demands of industrialists and businessmen, it will be conducive to the advancement of socialist transformation. Over the past few years, our association and organizations at all levels have frequently reflected the situation, put forward opinions and suggestions on the problems existing in the production and operation, taxation issues, labor-capital issues, and other public-private relations of private enterprises. After the overall joint state-private operation, we have also done a lot of reflection, suggestions, and consultation work on property assessment, personnel arrangements, living treatment, and handling some remaining problems. All these tasks not only represent the legitimate interests of industrialists and businessmen, but also promote the cause of socialist transformation. This is the best proof.

While representing the legitimate interests and reasonable demands of industrialists and businessmen, we must also make industrialists and businessmen understand that current interests should be subordinate to long-term interests, and individual interests should be subordinate to the overall interests of the country. Building a socialist society is in the interests of the people of the whole country, and also in the interests of industrialists and businessmen. Therefore, we must oppose certain practices of industrialists and businessmen that harm others and benefit themselves and behaviors that violate national laws. Of course, due to the gradual improvement of the ideological understanding of industrialists and businessmen, illegal behaviors have become less and less, but we should still not ignore this problem. The practice of only representing legitimate interests and not opposing illegal behaviors is not appropriate.

Conduct Persuasive Education Targeting Ideological Conditions

Conducting persuasive education for industrialists and businessmen based on the ideological characteristics of industrial and commercial circles, combined with the ideological changes and specific facts of each period, is a basic principle in ideological education work. Not combining with ideological conditions becomes "shooting without a target"; not combining with specific facts becomes "dogmatic preaching." In this way, the effect of persuasive education cannot be achieved.

(1) "What is the future, what is the trend" is a question that industrial and commercial circles often care about. After Chairman Mao put forward this question in October 1955 and pointed out the laws of social development and the bright future of industrial and commercial circles, the ideological understanding of industrialists and businessmen across the country was greatly improved and enthusiasm rose universally. From Chairman Mao's instructions, we have learned that pointing out the future in response to concerns has an important encouraging effect on industrialists and businessmen. We should constantly carry out socialist future education for industrialists and businessmen, help industrialists and businessmen understand the laws of social development, and recognize the bright future of the country and the beautiful prospects of socialism. We should thoroughly and repeatedly explain the consistency between the future of the country and the future of individuals, so that industrialists and businessmen understand that they should entrust their destiny to the strength of the country and the achievements of socialist construction. We should help industrial and commercial circles recognize their historical tasks and directions of efforts, and constantly give encouragement and support. All these are to help industrialists and businessmen see the future clearly, dispel their concerns, and thereby actively accept socialist transformation.

(2) In the process of the victorious advance of socialist transformation, our industrialists and businessmen can encounter many difficulties at any time. Experience has proven that due to the characteristics of weakness and wavering in industrial and commercial circles, ideological fluctuations are easily triggered when encountering difficulties. We should be good at grasping the laws of ideological change in industrial and commercial circles, and provide timely help and education. When they waver, help them stabilize; when they are passive, encourage them to be active; when they lack confidence, help them overcome difficulties, strengthen their confidence, and continue to move forward.

(3) Education must be combined with actual conditions. Over the past few years, industrialists and businessmen have made great progress, and the positive side has continued to increase, but the negative side still exists. In order to better play the active role of industrialists and businessmen and gradually weaken the negative side, we must adopt a policy of encouraging and praising, educating and criticizing. In the work of encouragement and criticism, we should realistically distinguish the boundaries between right and wrong. Encouragement and criticism are both for education, for unity, and for transformation. The practice of arbitrarily putting on a "hat" without asking about the facts or distinguishing between right and wrong is only harmful and not beneficial.

Cultivate Key Members, Give Play to Their Leading, Exemplary, and Bridging Roles

Cultivating key members in industrial and commercial circles, giving play to their enthusiasm, and using their exemplary deeds and personal experiences to conduct persuasive education and unity work for the vast number of industrialists and businessmen is an important aspect of assisting the state in carrying out socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises. In this regard, the organizations at all levels of this association have also done a lot of work under the leadership and care of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government. After the Second Meeting of the First Executive Committee, more key members emerged in large numbers from all aspects, becoming an active factor in promoting the high tide of socialist transformation.

In socialist transformation, key members play a leading and exemplary role, and influence the vast number of industrialists and businessmen to accept socialist transformation with their actions. Key members live in the vast industrial and commercial circles, understand the situation of industrial and commercial circles, care about the lives of industrialists and businessmen, and help industrialists and businessmen improve their understanding, so they can gain the trust of industrialists and businessmen and become a bridge for the vast number of industrialists and businessmen to establish close contact with the Party and the government. With the connection between key members and the vast number of industrialists and businessmen, the Federation of Industry and Commerce can correctly reflect the opinions and demands of industrialists and businessmen, unite and educate the vast number of industrialists and businessmen, and better play its due role.

The cultivation of key members should adopt the principles of active education, full care, and rational use. Help key members systematically learn theory, learn to analyze and deal with problems from the position, viewpoint, and method of the working class, and learn socialist management methods in the practice of work. It is necessary to maintain close contact with key members, fully care about their ideology, learning, work, and living conditions, so that their learning, work, and life can be appropriately arranged and resolved. It is necessary to actively discover the new forces of key members, boldly use them, and promptly help and supervise them, so that they can be tempered and improved in their work. For the exemplary deeds and work achievements of key members, they should be praised and encouraged in a timely manner; for their wrong ideas and work shortcomings, they should also be persuaded and corrected in a timely manner.

The cultivation of key members must also clarify the requirements for them, and gradually increase their requirements according to the development of socialist transformation and the degree of awareness of key members. The basic requirements for key members should be: (1) able to closely approach the Party and the People's Government, and love the cause of socialism; (2) in joint state-private enterprises, able to be dedicated to their duties, actively improve the relationship between public and private cooperation and the unity between private individuals, and make achievements in their work; (3) able to maintain close contact with the masses, reflect the opinions and demands of industrialists and businessmen, and become a bridge for industrial and commercial circles to establish close contact with the Party and the People's Government; (4) able to study hard, transform their thinking, gradually change their capitalist standpoints, and establish socialist ideological consciousness; (5) able to be consistent in words and deeds, set an example, and play a pioneering, leading, and exemplary core role in socialist transformation.

III. Several Suggestions for Future Work

After our country's socialist revolution has achieved a decisive victory, the people of the whole country, including our industrialists and businessmen, are concentrating their efforts with full confidence to resolve the contradiction between the advanced socialist system and the backward social productive forces. At the same time, after the overall joint state-private operation, industrialists and businessmen are eagerly demanding to improve their ideological understanding and management capabilities, hoping to make achievements in their work in order to gradually transform into real laborers. Faced with this new situation, the main task of the Federation of Industry and Commerce should be to strengthen unity, educate the vast number of industrialists and businessmen to continue to accept socialist transformation, give full play to their active role, and contribute all their strength to our country's great socialist construction cause. To this end, the following suggestions are made for future work.

First, continue to help industrialists and businessmen continuously improve and improve their work and thinking, mainly by organizing them to participate in political theory learning, improve their patriotic ideological understanding, and conduct ideological transformation in order to achieve the goal of breaking capitalism and establishing socialism. Our organizations at all levels should, according to the possibility of conditions, under the unified leadership of the local CPPCC, plan to organize industrialists and businessmen in batches to participate in a systematic political theory learning in the next two or three years, and at the same time do a good job in regular spare-time learning, and expand various report meetings and learning lectures. Help industrialists and businessmen solve various difficulties in learning as much as possible, and organize more industrialist and business people to participate in various learning activities on a voluntary basis. In areas where conditions permit, various technical training classes or cultural training classes can be held to meet the requirements of industrialists and businessmen to learn technology and culture. Help industrialists and businessmen gradually learn socialist management methods, learn to analyze and deal with problems from the position, viewpoint, and method of the working class, and strive to carry out ideological transformation with enterprises as the main base, establish labor viewpoints, and learn from the working class with a humble and sincere attitude. For the families of industrialists and businessmen, the local Democratic Women's Federation should be contacted to organize them to study.

Second, actively promote the vast number of industrialists and businessmen to participate in socialist competition, and contribute all their knowledge and talents to the socialist cause. In order to help industrialists and businessmen do a good job in socialist competition, organizations at all levels should do the following work well: (1) Continue to strengthen propaganda and education work, so that industrialists and businessmen recognize that participating in socialist competition is a contribution to socialist industrialization and a way to transform themselves into real laborers. (2) Encourage key members to actively participate in socialist competition and play a leading and exemplary role. (3) Adopt various ways and methods to exchange experiences in participating in the competition; in areas where conditions permit, conferences of advanced production and workers can be held for commendation and encouragement. (4) Use key forces to go deep into the lower levels, understand the situation, reflect opinions, and make suggestions. It is necessary to maintain close contact with relevant parties such as trade unions and professional companies to help industrialists and businessmen solve the problems that should be solved in participating in the competition. (5) Promote industrialists and businessmen to strive to improve the relationship between public and private cooperation, carry out the increase in production and economy, do a good job in production and operation, actively participate in the reorganization and transformation of enterprises, perform their duties conscientiously, and do a good job in the work of unity between private individuals. Give industrialists and businessmen all the necessary support so that they can make achievements in the competition and play a greater role for socialism.

Third, care about the life and work of industrialists and businessmen, and maintain close contact with the vast number of industrialists and businessmen.

After the overall joint state-private operation, industrialists and businessmen have actually handed over their enterprises and become state public officials. Therefore, further caring about the lives of industrialists and businessmen and reflecting their opinions and requirements to give play to the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen is of greater significance. The interests and requirements of handicraftsmen and small merchants and peddlers also need our care and attention.

The Federation of Industry and Commerce is its own organization of industrialists and businessmen, and is a united front-type group. It should become: a bridge for the Communist Party of China and the People's Government to establish close contact with the vast number of industrialists and businessmen, an assistant to the state in uniting, educating, and transforming industrialists and businessmen, and an institution that reflects the opinions and suggestions of the vast number of industrialists and businessmen and discusses and studies industrial and commercial issues. It should care about the lives, work, study, and ideological conditions of its members, and provide them with help and education. It should go deep into the lower levels, maintain close contact with the vast number of industrialists and businessmen, listen to their opinions and requirements, and represent the interests of the vast number of industrialists and businessmen, reflect the opinions and requirements of industrialists and businessmen to the relevant departments, and put forward suggestions and criticisms to assist the relevant departments in making proper arrangements. Only in this way can the vast number of industrialists and businessmen be attracted to unite closely around the Party and the government, and can all the active factors of industrialists and businessmen be better utilized to serve socialism. Any practice of deviating from the masses, deviating from reality, and not caring about the lives of the masses is detrimental to socialist transformation.

Our key members of industrial and commercial circles and all staff members should overcome the tendency to deviate from the masses, strengthen contact with the vast number of industrialists and businessmen, so that the Federation of Industry and Commerce can play its due role. This conference will discuss the methods for industrial and commercial circles to help each other with living expenses. After this method is passed by the conference, organizations at all levels should also combine the specific circumstances of each region to do a good job in the mutual assistance fund for industrial and commercial circles, so that industrialists and businessmen with difficulties in life can get the necessary help.

Fourth, strengthen the business guidance work and ideological education work for handicraftsmen and small merchants and peddlers. Before the overall joint state-private operation, the organizations at all levels of our association focused on assisting state organs in implementing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in large cities, and therefore did not pay enough attention to the business, living conditions, and ideological education of handicraftsmen and small merchants and peddlers. In the future, while helping capitalist industrialists and businessmen carry out ideological transformation, we should strengthen the business guidance work and ideological education work for the individual economy. At present, there are still some problems in the production and operation, life, learning, and management style of the vast number of handicraftsmen, small merchants, and peddlers. Especially when the free market under state leadership is actively developing throughout the country, and the exchange of materials in the primary market is rapidly expanding, we still lack experience on how to guide small merchants and peddlers to further play a positive role in the exchange of materials under the guidance of the correct national policy. In the future, our organizations at all levels should, on the one hand, actively care about the political and economic interests of the vast number of individual handicraftsmen, small merchants, and peddlers, and closely contact the relevant departments to solve some of the problems that should be solved; on the other hand, they should organize them to study, help them improve their ideological awareness, improve their management, correct their management style, and prevent and overcome speculation and violation of national market management.

In addition, our organizations at all levels should also actively promote industrialists and businessmen to participate in various patriotic movements and social activities, and appropriately organize industrialists and businessmen to visit various socialist construction and exhibitions to improve patriotic ideology and socialist consciousness. In order to give industrialists and businessmen enough time to participate in the production and operation of enterprises and have a certain amount of time to participate in learning and social activities, the relevant departments should be contacted to appropriately resolve the contradiction between their enterprise work and social activities and help make proper arrangements.

Due to the great achievements of our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, more and more international friends have been attracted to pay attention, so our work to participate in international activities will become increasingly heavy. In the future, this association and organizations in some large and medium-sized cities should organize people from industrial and commercial circles to participate in various international activities to strengthen friendly exchanges with industrialists and businessmen from all over the world and promote economic exchanges between people of all countries and the development of world peace.

In order to do the above work well, we should further strengthen and improve the organizational structure so that our organization can better adapt to the needs of the work. This conference will pass the "Constitution of the Federation of Industry and Commerce." After the new constitution is implemented, there will be a large number of individual members. This is a new organizational work and deserves the attention of organizations at all levels, especially at the city and county levels. At present, some trade association organizations are not sound enough and cannot meet the needs of the work. They should be reorganized and reorganized according to the professional company system so that they can better play a professional role. In the past, the leadership relationship between superiors and subordinates was not close enough, and some organizations did not give full play to the collective leadership. In the future, under the leadership of the local party and government, the leadership relationship between superiors and subordinates should be strengthened and the principle of collective leadership should be further implemented.

In order to do the above work well, the staff of our organizations at all levels should strengthen learning, further improve their ideological understanding and policy level, so that our work can adapt to the constantly developing requirements of the socialist cause; we should establish a better working relationship with the committee members and serve the socialist cause together under socialist principles. At present, a small number of staff members, due to lack of understanding of the tasks and roles of the Federation of Industry and Commerce after the overall joint state-private operation, mistakenly believe that the Federation of Industry and Commerce is no longer necessary, and therefore are not at ease with their work. This is an incorrect view. It should be recognized that the Federation of Industry and Commerce will not only continue to play a role, but will also exist for a long time. To work with peace of mind and better play its enthusiasm and creativity. For the salary level, welfare, medical care and other issues of staff at all levels, it is hoped that organizations at all levels will contact the local relevant departments after consulting with the methods stipulated by our association and make appropriate arrangements.

    中华全国工商业联合会第一届执行委员会三年来的工作报告（摘要）
    中华全国工商业联合会副主任委员  荣毅仁
    新华社11日讯　中华全国工商业联合会副主任委员荣毅仁代表全国工商联第一届执行委员会在今天的代表大会上作“三年来的工作报告”，摘要如下：
    一、三年来的工作
    协助国家机关贯彻和平改造的政策，团结、教育广大工商业者积极接受社会主义改造，并代表工商业者的合法利益和合理要求，是我们工商业联合会的基本任务。三年来，我会和各级组织根据这个基本任务，主要进行了如下各项工作。
    关于业务辅导工作
    三年来，我会和各级组织的业务辅导工作是随着社会主义改造的逐步深入而发展的，主要是推动和帮助广大工商业者走上国家资本主义的道路。
    这些工作是：（一）辅导私营工商业初步地纳入了国家资本主义的轨道。第一届会员代表大会闭幕以后，我会和各级组织，一方面广泛地宣传了国家过渡时期总任务，同时积极地辅导私营工商业逐步地走上国家资本主义的道路。
    （二）开展增产节约、改善经营管理的工作。我们配合有关部门，在工业方面逐步地开展了增产节约运动，在商业方面也积极地开展了改善经营管理的工作，为进一步接受改造创造了必要的条件。
    （三）协助国家机关贯彻“统筹兼顾、全面安排、积极改造”的方针。我们在若干城市若干行业中，做了比较具体的调查研究工作，提供了一些全业安排的意见。对于商业的调网并店，工厂的裁并改组，加工订货任务的分配，工缴利润，规格标准，以及税收政策和公私合营方面所存在的问题，作了必要的反映和协商工作。协助有关部门统筹安排的结果，进一步扩大了加工订货。部分地区的主要工业行业，开始采取以大带小，以先进带落后的原则，根据生产上的协作关系，进行并厂、合营。更多的零售商业被纳入了经销、代销的形式。部分手工业和小商小贩开始被组织起来，各种互助合作形式有所发展。这就为全行业公私合营和合作化准备了有利的条件。
    （四）推动私营工商业实行全行业公私合营和合作化。
    在第一届执行委员会第二次会议的时候，毛主席邀集全体委员进行了座谈，作了亲切的教导，使大家认识了社会发展的规律，懂得了掌握自己的命运，同时政府明确宣布了“统筹安排，全面规划”的政策。会后，各级组织进行了层层传达，大大地鼓舞了工商业者走社会主义道路的信心，纷纷要求公私合营。在农业合作化高潮的影响下，终于在1956年1月，在全国范围内掀起了全行业公私合营和合作化的高潮。
    （五）推动工商业者参加社会主义竞赛。根据十省三直辖市不完全的统计，本年第三季度参加竞赛的工商业者共达三十八万多人，获得光荣称号的达四万九千多人；获得物质奖的达二万七千多人。这是一个富有实践意义的社会主义教育，是工商业者在全行业公私合营以后为社会主义建设作出贡献的榜样。
    关于宣传教育工作
    三年来，我们结合社会主义改造的形势，针对工商界思想发展的过程，进行了几次全面的重大的社会主义前途教育。
    第一，在国家过渡时期总任务宣布以后，在共同纲领的思想基础上，着重地进行了接受社会主义改造的思想教育。
    第二，在宪法草案公布的时候，各地工商业者积极地参加了讨论并踊跃的提出了意见。在宪法正式公布以后，我们又着重地向广大工商业者进行了遵守法律和坚决走社会主义道路的思想教育。
    第三，在本会第一届执行委员会第二次会议以后，本会推动各级组织立即在全国广大工商界中层层深入地传达了毛主席的教导。这是传达最广泛最深入的一次，基本上作到了家喻户晓，深入人心。
    第四，三年以来，各地经常性的学习组织和各种讲座不断发展，参加学习人数不断增加。很多地区专门为小商小贩和小工商业者设立了讲座或报告会。截至1956年9月止，已有北京、天津、上海等三直辖市，及二十一个省的许多省辖市举办了短期讲习班。参加脱产学习的工商业者，据不完全的统计，已达三万三千多人。部分专区辖市和县工商联也举办了短期讲习班。这种短期讲习班尚在继续发展，并受到工商界普遍的欢迎。各地根据工商业者的不同程度，更广泛地设立了经常性的高级中级初级的学习组织，参加学习的队伍更为扩大，将近百万人。
    在进行社会主义前途教育的同时，我们还经常地、反复地对广大工商业者进行了爱国守法的教育和组织工商业者学习国内外政治时事和国家重要的政策法令，我们还不断组织工商业者参加了各种爱国运动与社会活动，其中主要的如：参加反对使用原子武器的签名运动，反对美蒋条约，支援解放台湾和支援埃及人民反殖民主义的斗争。最近一年来，国际活动迅速增加，本会和不少工商界人士参加了各种国际招待工作，并接待了国际友人的访问，有的还参加了出国访问团和国际性会议。
    关于组织工作
    三年以来，我会根据组织通则所规定的原则，督促各地建立并健全了组织机构、整顿改组了同业公会，使组织机构更能适应于国家在过渡时期总任务的要求。截至1956年10月止，本会直属组织中，有二十一个省、二自治区、三直辖市已正式成立了工商业联合会，有一个省建立了筹备委员会。在一百五十七个省辖市和七个盟辖市、自治区辖市、自治州辖市中，除个别区辖市外，都已建立了正式组织。在二千一百一十个县份中，已建立组织的共计一千九百二十八个。在县工商联下，一般都按具体情况，设有分会、办事处或工商小组。部分地区的同业公会，已根据专业公司的组织系统，进行了调整和改组，进一步发挥了专业性的作用。
    三年来，广大的工商界骨干分子参加了工商业联合会的工作，担任了委员和小组长职务，几年来在工作中受到了锻炼。担任各级组织的委员和小组长的达十多万人，在社会主义改造中，发挥了带头作用、模范作用和桥梁作用。
    我会和各级组织的专职工作人员约计四万人。几年来他们的辛勤劳动，对于工商业联合会的工作，作出了有益的贡献。
    几年来，我们的工作虽然有了一定的成就，但也存在着缺点。就全国工商联来说：
    一、在业务辅导方面，对于各级组织缺乏及时的具体的指导和帮助。对于各级组织反映上来的材料，缺乏深入的研究分析工作，因而对于国家机关方面，反映较多，建议较少。
    二、在思想教育方面，我们对于工商业者的思想变化情况了解不透，针对思想进行教育的工作，还做得不够。组织学习的工作还不能满足各方面的要求，还有很大的一部分中小工商业者没有得到经常学习的机会。学习的教材过于一般化，不能适应各种不同类型工商业者的要求。
    三、在组织工作方面所存在的问题，几年来，我们缺乏认真的态度进行研究和解决。如省级的工作是新的工作，大家缺乏经验，我们还没有深入地进行研究和总结。对于同业公会如何更好地发挥专业性的作用，它同区工商联如何分工配合，我们也没有具体研究。造成以上这些缺点的原因，一方面，由于我们的调查研究工作做得不够深入和及时，总结经验的工作做得不够，因而提不出具体的意见和办法；另一方面，由于我们还不习惯于集体领导，上下联系不够，没有及时地邀集各级组织来共同讨论，因而没有很好地在工作中发挥集体的力量。
    二、在协助国家贯彻和平改造政策中我们工作的几点体会
    在促进广大工商业者积极接受社会主义改造的过程中，工商业联合会是起了应有的作用的。根据几年来的实践，我们体会到，要引导工商业者积极地走上社会主义的大道，就必须做好如下几方面的工作。这就是：（1）必须紧紧地依靠党的领导；（2）必须代表工商业者的合法利益与合理要求；（3）必须针对思想进行说服教育；（4）必须培养骨干分子，发挥带头、模范和桥梁作用。
    紧紧地依靠中国共产党的领导
    对私营工商业进行社会主义改造，党采取了和平改造的政策。正确地贯彻和平改造的政策，是促使工商业者积极地接受改造的基本条件。数年来，由于党的政策的正确贯彻，工商业者不但敲锣打鼓地掀起了全行业公私合营的高潮，而且正在逐步地转变成为劳动人民。
    要正确地贯彻党的政策，就必须紧紧地依靠党的领导。党的领导是我们进行工作的指针。离开了它，我们就会在工作上迷失方向。在私营工商业实现社会主义改造的过程中，党采取了适合于我国国情的和平政策，并作出了必要的步骤和部署，使私营工商业者有可能接受社会主义改造。我们密切地遵循着党所规定的步骤和部署来进行工作，就会事半功倍，顺利地完成任务。
    党在贯彻和平改造政策的过程中，经常向我们进行教育，并采取协商的方式，通过我们各级组织向广大工商业者吸取反映和意见，使我们工商业者的合理要求和意见，得到妥善的处理。这就使我们体会到，党为了发展生产，经常对我们工商业者加以关怀和照顾。党的领导使我们感到亲切和温暖。
    为了做好工作，我们还必须取得各级人民委员会和政协委员会的指导以及其他有关部门的支持和帮助，因而我们必须同各有关部门取得密切的联系。
    代表工商业者的合法利益与合理要求
    代表工商业者的合法利益与合理要求，是工商业联合会做好工作、团结广大工商业者的一个重要环节。在社会主义改造过程中，国家对于私人的生产资料采取逐步赎买的办法，其目的是为了使工商业者有一个必要的时间来安心地接受改造。正确地贯彻赎买政策以实现对私营工商业的社会主义改造，是符合于全国人民的最大利益的。因此，代表工商业者的合法利益与合理要求，使工商业者积极地接受社会主义改造，也是与全国人民的利益相一致的。
    在社会主义改造中，工商业者有自己的利益和要求。凡是我们恰当地代表了工商业者的合法利益，及时地反映了情况和意见，经过国家的安排，适当地照顾了工商业者合理要求的时候，就会有利于社会主义改造工作的向前推进。我会和各级组织几年来对于私营企业的生产经营、税务问题、劳资问题以及其他公私关系方面所存在的问题，经常地反映情况，提出意见和建议。在全行业公私合营以后，有关财产清估、人事安排、生活待遇以及处理一些遗留的问题，又做了不少反映、建议和协商工作。所有这些工作，不但代表了工商业者的合法利益，也推动了社会主义改造事业。这就是最好的证明。
    在代表工商业者合法利益与合理要求的同时，还必须使工商业者懂得当前利益应服从长远利益，个人利益应服从国家的整体利益。建设社会主义社会，是全国人民的利益，也是工商业者的利益。因此，我们必须反对工商业者某些损人利己的做法和违背国家法律的行为。当然，由于工商业者思想认识的逐步提高，违法行为已越来越少，但我们还是不应该忽视这个问题，只代表合法利益而不反对非法行为的做法，是不应该的。
    针对思想情况进行说服教育
    针对工商界的思想特点，结合每一时期的思想变化情况和具体事实，向工商业者进行说服教育，是思想教育工作中一项基本方针。不结合思想情况，便成“无的放矢”；不结合具体事实，便成“教条一番”。这样，便不能收到说服教育的效果。
    （一）“前途如何，趋势如何”，是工商界所经常关心的问题。毛主席于1955年10月提出了这一问题，并向工商界指出了社会发展规律和工商界的光明前途以后，全国工商业者的思想认识大大地提高，积极性普遍高涨。从毛主席的指示中，使我们体会到，针对顾虑，指出前途，对于工商业者有重要的鼓舞作用。应该经常地向工商业者进行社会主义前途教育，帮助工商业者认识社会发展规律，认清国家的光明前途和社会主义的美好远景。应该透彻地反复地说明国家前途和个人前途的一致性，使工商业者懂得把自己的命运依托于国家的强大和社会主义建设的成就。应该帮助工商界认清自己的历史任务和努力方向，并经常给以鼓励和支持。所有这些都是为了帮助工商业者看清前途、解除顾虑，从而积极地接受社会主义的改造。
    （二）在社会主义改造胜利前进的过程中，我们工商业者随时可以碰到许多困难。经验证明，由于工商界有软弱动摇的特点，在碰到困难的时候，是容易引起思想波动的。我们应该善于掌握工商界思想变化规律，及时地进行帮助和教育。在动摇的时候，帮助他们安定；在消极的时候，鼓励他们积极；在信心不足的时候，帮助他们克服困难，坚定信心，继续前进。
    （三）必须结合实际情况，进行教育。几年来，工商业者有了很大的进步，积极的一面不断增涨，但是消极的一面也还存在。为了更好地发挥工商业者的积极作用，逐步削弱消极的一面，必须采取有鼓励有表扬、有教育有批评的方针。在进行鼓励和批评的工作中，我们应该实事求是地分清是非界限，鼓励、批评都是为了教育，为了团结，为了改造。不问事实，不分是非，随便扣上一顶“帽子”的做法，是只有害处，没有好处的。
    培养骨干分子，发挥带头、模范和桥梁作用
    培养工商界骨干分子，发挥他们的积极性，利用他们的模范事迹和亲身体会，对广大工商界进行说服教育和团结工作，是协助国家对私营工商业进行社会主义改造工作的一个重要方面。在这方面，本会各级组织在中国共产党和人民政府的领导和关怀下，也做了不少工作。第一届执行委员会第二次会议以后，更多的骨干分子从各方面大批涌现出来，成为推动社会主义改造高潮的积极因素。
    在社会主义改造中，骨干分子发挥了带头、模范的作用，并以其行动影响广大工商业者接受社会主义改造。骨干分子生活在广大工商界中，了解工商界的情况，关心工商业者的生活，帮助工商业者提高认识，因而能够获得工商业者的信任，成为广大工商业者同党和政府取得密切联系的桥梁。有了骨干分子同广大工商业者的联系，工商业联合会就能够正确地反映工商业者的意见和要求，团结教育广大工商业者，更好地发挥它应有的作用。
    培养骨干分子应当采取积极教育、充分关怀、合理使用的方针。帮助骨干分子有系统地学习理论，学习以工人阶级的立场、观点和方法来分析和处理问题，并在工作的实践中学习社会主义经营管理方法。要密切与骨干分子的联系，充分关心他们的思想、学习、工作和生活情况，使他们的学习、工作和生活得到适当的安排和解决。要积极发掘骨干分子的新生力量，大胆使用，并及时帮助、督促，使他们在工作中得到锻炼和提高。对于骨干分子的模范事迹和工作成就，要及时给以表扬和鼓励；对于他们的错误思想和工作缺点，也要及时进行说服和纠正。
    培养骨干分子还必须明确对他们的要求，并应根据社会主义改造的发展情况与骨干分子的觉悟程度，逐步提高其要求。对骨干分子的基本要求，应该是：（1）能够紧密地靠拢党和人民政府，热爱社会主义事业；（2）在公私合营企业中，能够守职尽责，主动地搞好公私共事关系和私私之间的团结，并在工作中做出成绩；（3）能够密切联系群众，反映工商业者的意见和要求，成为工商界同党和人民政府取得密切联系的桥梁；（4）能够努力学习，改造思想，逐步改变资本主义的立场观点，建立社会主义的思想意识；（5）能够言行一致，以身作则，在社会主义改造中起先知先行、带头、模范的核心作用。
    三、对于今后工作的几点建议
    在我国社会主义革命取得决定性的胜利以后，全国人民包括我们工商业者在内，正在满怀信心地集中力量来解决先进的社会主义制度同落后的社会生产力之间的矛盾。同时，在全行业公私合营以后，工商业者急迫地要求提高自己的思想认识与经营管理能力，希望在工作中做出成绩，以便逐步转变成为名副其实的劳动者。在这个新的形势前面，工商业联合会的主要任务应该是，加强团结、教育广大工商业者继续接受社会主义改造，充分发挥积极作用，为我国伟大的社会主义建设事业贡献出一切力量。为此，对于今后的工作，提出如下几点建议。
    第一，继续帮助工商业者在工作上和思想上不断地获得进步与提高，主要是组织他们参加政治理论学习，提高爱国主义思想认识，进行思想改造，以达到破资本主义、立社会主义的目的。我们各级组织应该根据条件的可能在当地政协统一领导下，在今后二、三年内有计划地组织工商业者分期分批地轮流参加一次有系统的政治理论学习，并同时搞好经常性的业余学习，扩大各种报告会和学习讲座。尽可能地帮助工商业者解决学习上的各种困难，组织更广泛的工商业者在自觉自愿的基础上参加各种学习。在条件许可的地区，可以举办各种技术学习班或文化学习班，以满足工商业者学习技术和文化的要求。帮助工商业者逐步学会社会主义的经营管理方法，学会以工人阶级的立场、观点和方法来分析和处理问题，并以企业为主要基地努力进行思想改造，建立劳动观点，以谦虚、诚恳的态度，努力向工人阶级学习。对于工商界家属，应该联系当地民主妇女联合会组织她们进行学习。
    第二，积极地推动广大工商业者参加社会主义竞赛，把一切知识和才能贡献给社会主义事业。为了帮助工商业者搞好社会主义竞赛，各级组织应该做好如下工作：（1）继续加强宣传教育工作，使工商业者认识参加社会主义竞赛就是对社会主义工业化的贡献，也是把自己改造成为名副其实的劳动者的途径。（2）鼓励骨干分子，积极参加社会主义竞赛，并起带头、模范作用。（3）采取各种方式方法交流参加竞赛的经验；在有条件的地区，可以召开先进生产和工作者会议，进行表扬和鼓励。（4）运用骨干力量，深入下层，了解情况，反映意见，提出建议。要与工会和专业公司等有关方面取得密切联系，帮助工商业者，解决参加竞赛中应该解决的问题。（5）推动工商业者努力改善公私共事关系，开展增产节约，搞好生产经营，积极参加企业的改组和改造工作，作到守职尽责，并搞好私私之间的团结工作。给工商业者以一切必要的支持，使他们能够在竞赛中作出成绩，为社会主义发挥更大的作用。
    第三，关心工商业者的生活和工作，密切与广大工商业者的联系。
    工商业者在全行业公私合营以后，实际上已经交出企业，成为国家的公职人员。因此，进一步关心工商业者的生活，反映其意见和要求，以发挥工商业者的积极性，就有更重要的意义。对于手工业者和小商小贩的利益和要求，也同样地需要我们关心和照顾。
    工商业联合会是工商业者自己的组织，是一个统一战线性质的团体。它应该成为：中国共产党和人民政府与广大工商业者取得密切联系的桥梁，协助国家团结、教育和改造工商业者的助手，反映广大工商业者的意见和建议、讨论和研究工商业问题的机构。它应该关心自己成员的生活、工作、学习和思想情况，对他们进行帮助和教育。它应该深入下层，与广大工商业者取得密切联系，听取他们的意见和要求，并代表广大工商业者的利益，向有关部门反映工商业者的意见和要求，提出建议和批评，协助有关部门作出妥善的安排。只有这样，才能吸引广大工商业者紧密地团结在党和政府的周围，才能更好地发挥工商业者的一切积极因素，为社会主义服务。任何脱离群众、脱离实际，不关心群众生活的做法，都是与社会主义改造不利的。
    我们工商界骨干分子和全体工作人员应该克服脱离群众的倾向，加强与广大工商业者的联系，使工商业联合会能够发挥应有的作用。这次大会将要讨论工商界生活互助金办法。这个办法在大会通过以后，各级组织还应该结合各地具体情况，办好工商界生活互助金，使生活上有困难的工商业者能够得到必要的帮助。
    第四，加强对手工业者和小商小贩的业务辅导工作和思想教育工作。在全行业公私合营以前，我会各级组织在大城市中，以协助国家机关贯彻对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造为工作重点，因而对于手工业者和小商小贩的业务、生活情况和思想教育工作，关心不够。今后，应该在帮助资本主义工商业者进行思想改造的同时，加强对个体经济的业务辅导工作和思想教育工作。目前，广大的手工业者、小商、小贩在生产经营、生活、学习和经营作风方面，还存在着一些问题。特别是在国家领导下的自由市场正在全国范围内积极发展，初级市场的物资交流正在迅速扩大的时候，对于如何辅导小商小贩在国家正确方针的指导下，进一步发挥在物资交流中的积极作用，我们还缺乏经验。今后，我们各级组织，一方面应该积极关心广大的个体手工业者和小商、小贩在政治上和经济上的利益，密切联系有关部门解决一些应该解决的问题；另一方面，应该组织他们进行学习，帮助他们提高思想觉悟，改善经营管理，端正经营作风，防止和克服投机取巧和违反国家市场管理的不良行为。
    此外，我们各级组织还应该积极地推动工商业者参加各种爱国运动、社会活动，适当地组织工商业者参观各种社会主义建设和展览，以提高爱国主义思想与社会主义觉悟。为了使工商业者有足够的时间参加企业的生产经营，并有一定时间参加学习和社会活动，应该联系有关部门适当地解决他们企业工作与社会活动之间的矛盾，帮助作出妥善的安排。
    由于我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的伟大成就，不断地吸引了越来越多的国际友人的关注，因而我们参加国际活动的工作将日益繁重。今后本会和部分大中城市的组织，应该组织工商界人士参加各项国际活动，以加强与世界各国工商业者的友好往来，促进各国人民之间的经济交流和世界和平事业的发展。
    为了做好以上工作，我们应该进一步加强和健全组织机构，使我们的组织能够更好地适应于工作的需要。这次大会将通过“工商业联合会章程”。在新的章程实施以后，个人会员将有大量的发展。这是一个新的组织工作，值得引起各级组织，特别是市、县各级组织的注意。目前，有些同业公会组织不够健全，不能适应工作的需要，应该按专业公司系统进行归口改组，使它更好地发挥专业性的作用。过去，上下级之间的领导关系不够密切，有些组织没有很好地发挥集体领导力量。今后，应该在当地党政的领导下，加强上下级之间的领导关系，进一步贯彻集体领导的原则。
    为了做好以上工作，我们各级组织的工作人员应该加强学习，进一步提高自己的思想认识和政策水平，使我们的工作能够适应社会主义事业不断发展的要求；应该与委员之间建立起更好的工作关系，在社会主义原则下，共同为社会主义事业服务。目前少数工作人员，由于不了解全行业公私合营以后工商业联合会的任务和作用，错误地认为工商业联合会已没有存在的必要，因而不安心工作，这是一种不正确的看法。应该认识，工商业联合会不但要继续发挥作用，而且还要长期存在。要安心工作，更好地发挥积极性与创造性。对于各级工作人员的薪级、福利、医疗等问题，希望各级组织根据我会所规定的办法，与当地有关部门联系后，作出适当的处理。
