They drink the same water, sing the same songs, and have kinship and deep friendship with the Burmese border people since ancient times. These Dai and Jingpo people from the mountains and plains are bringing elephant-foot drums and ethnic musical instruments, along with their friendship towards the Burmese people, to gather with the Burmese border people and engage in various friendship activities.
