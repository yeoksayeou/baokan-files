    The First Grain Production on the Xilin Gol League Grassland
    By Our Correspondent Lin Mo
    The boundless Xilin Gol League grassland of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region stretches for two thousand li from east to west, an area larger than the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang combined. This green, ocean-like grassland covers fertile land, but for many years, the Mongolian brothers who have roamed this grassland have never cultivated it. All their grain had to be transported from other places, and livestock relied entirely on natural grazing. This kind of animal husbandry economy was very unstable. Sometimes, heavy snow closed off the grassland, preventing the passage of people, horses, and vehicles. Grain could not be transported in, leaving people without food and livestock without fodder. During the severe snow disaster in the spring of 1954, aircraft dispatched from Beijing had to airdrop supplies to overcome the difficulties.
    If grain and fodder could be grown on the grassland, it would obviously be a major event for the Mongolian brothers in their settled life.
    Such a thing has already begun: In 1956, ten pastoral production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in this grassland opened up fodder and grain bases. With the help of fifty-one Han Chinese farmers, the herdsmen grew grain, fodder, and vegetables for the first time.
    Some time ago, I visited the Jinxing Pastoral Cooperative in the Second Zu (District) of West Ujimqin Banner. They opened up a total of 400 mu of wasteland. In the first year, everyone lacked experience, and spring plowing was delayed by a month. They planted 60 mu of crops and 5 mu of vegetables. Although the sowing was a bit late, the weather was favorable this year, and the soil was fertile. The waist-deep millet and dense buckwheat added new vitality to the vast grassland. They seemed to proudly announce to the people: We have grown here and are growing very well!
    Five Han Chinese farmers from the Yongli Agricultural Cooperative in Qianwusu Township, Linxi County, helped with the farming in the Jinxing Cooperative. The Jinxing Cooperative also sent five herdsmen to learn alongside them. The ten brothers from the two ethnic groups were like the ten fingers of two hands, inseparable from each other every day. When working, they were side by side; when walking, they were one after the other. Although they did not understand each other's language, they shared the same goal. The herdsmen said, "The Han Chinese elder brothers are good at farming, kind to people, and patient in teaching techniques." The farmers said, "The Mongolian brothers are not afraid of hardship, willing to work, and eager to learn." In less than half a year, the Mongolian brothers could do everything they had done, such as weeding, harvesting, plowing, harrowing, and grinding.
    The crops they grew were a living exhibition on the grassland. As soon as the seedlings emerged, some herdsmen would run to the ground to watch. As the crops grew taller, more people came to watch. The herdsmen watched these crops grow day by day. An old lama living nearby said, "I sincerely cherish these crops! I want to see how they are grown."
    The vegetables grown by the Jinxing Cooperative came one after another. When people saw that the best head of Chinese cabbage weighed twelve jin and a white radish weighed more than six jin, they were extremely happy. Vegetables were piled up in the yurts of the cooperative members, and everyone had learned to pickle vegetables and stew meat with cabbage and radish. They sent the vegetables they could not eat in time to the nearby mutual aid teams by cart, inviting the surrounding herdsmen brothers and sisters to taste the new produce.
    This spring, when the proposal to have Han Chinese farmers come to help open up fodder and grain bases was first put forward, the herdsmen had great concerns. People said: In the past, it was because the Han Chinese reclaimed wasteland and occupied our land that our grassland shrank year by year. Some herdsmen worried: After planting crops on the grassland, where will our livestock graze? The cadres repeatedly explained that planting fodder and grain was precisely to better develop animal husbandry production. Besides, encroaching on land and bullying Mongolians was a thing of the old society. Now our new China is a big family of ethnic unity. We are asking the Han Chinese for help, and they will leave after the work is done. The land is our own, and no one can take away the technology we learn.
    The facts did not disappoint their expectations. After the autumn harvest, the herdsmen talked about growing more grain and vegetables next year. Gradually taking root in the land, settling down, the lives of people and livestock will be guaranteed.
    The Han Chinese farmers who came to the grassland to help with cultivation won the love of the Mongolian brothers with their hard work and sincere service. They worked hard from dawn to dusk every day, patiently teaching techniques. When they could not go to the fields due to wind and rain, they helped the herdsmen tidy up livestock sheds and mud-plaster houses and repair kang beds for the lamas. The several lama families living near the Jinxing Cooperative planted vegetables and dug a well with the help of the farmers. The herdsmen said, "These Han Chinese elder brothers are sincerely here to help us." During the Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival, the herdsmen and local lamas of the Jinxing Cooperative slaughtered fat sheep for the Han Chinese farmers and carried large buckets of milk wine to them. Everyone ate and sang together lively! The five Mongolian brothers who were learning farming with them raised their glasses and sang:
    You Han Chinese brothers from Linxi County,
    Please drink this cup of gratitude wine!
    We have seen that we have grown crops on the grassland,
    Now our hands have learned skills,
    This is a great joy that has never happened before!
    When the autumn harvest was not yet complete, Jigemude, the director of the Jinxing Cooperative, discussed with the Han Chinese farmers, hoping that they would leave one or two people to settle down locally and participate in production. (Attached pictures)

    锡林郭勒盟大草原上第一次生产了粮食
    本报记者　林沫
    一望无际的内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒盟大草原，从东到西两千里，面积比江苏和浙江两个省还要大。这绿茫茫的像海洋一样的草原呵，草下边盖着肥沃的土地，但多少年来一直游牧在这块草原上的蒙古族弟兄，却从来没有耕种过它。他们吃的粮食，全要由外地运进来，牲畜也全靠自然草原进行放牧。这样的畜牧业经济，是很不稳定的。有时候，大雪封闭了草原，人马车辆不能通行，粮食运不进来，人没吃的，牲畜也缺乏饲料。1954年春季发生大雪灾的时候，由北京派飞机来进行空投，才度过了当时的困难。
    如果能在草原上种出粮食和饲料，显然，这已是蒙古族兄弟在定居生活中一件重要的大事。
    这样的事情已经开始了：1956年，这块草原上有十个牧业生产合作社和互助组开辟了饲料和粮食基地。牧民们在五十一个汉族农民的帮助下，第一次种出了粮食、饲料和蔬菜。
    前一个时期，我曾经参观过西乌珠穆沁旗二佐（区）金星牧业社。他们一共开了四百亩荒地。头一年，大家还没有经验，春耕迟了一个月，种了六十亩庄稼和五亩蔬菜。播种虽然迟了些，但今年风调雨顺，地力肥壮，那齐腰深的糜子，密密丛丛的荞麦，给茫茫的草原增加了新的活力，它们好像骄傲地向人们宣布：我们在这儿生长起来了，而且长得很好！
    在金星社帮助种地的是林西县前乌苏乡永利农业社的五个汉族农民。金星社也派了五个牧民跟着学习。两个民族的十个弟兄，好像两个手的十个指头，每天谁也离不开谁。干起活来，一左一右；走起路来，一前一后。彼此虽然语言不通，但目的却是一个。牧民说：“汉族老大哥庄稼做得好，对人亲热，教技术又耐心。”农民说：“蒙古族弟兄不怕辛苦，肯干，又用心学。”不到半年工夫，凡是他们干过的活，像锄草、收割、耕、犁、耙、磨，蒙古族弟兄样样都能做了。
    他们种出的庄稼，在草原上真是一个活的展览会。苗儿刚刚出土，有些牧民就跑来蹲在地里看。庄稼长高了，看的人就更多了。这些庄稼简直是牧民们一天天望着长大的，住在附近的一个老喇嘛说：“我打心眼里稀罕这些庄稼呀！要好好看看是怎么种的。”
    金星社种的菜，一样接着一样下来了。人们看到大白菜最好的一棵有十二斤重，白萝卜一个有六斤多，都高兴极了。社员们家家蒙古包里堆着蔬菜，大家已学会了腌咸菜，用白菜、萝卜炖肉吃。一时还吃不完的蔬菜，他们就用大车送到附近的互助组去，请周围牧民兄弟姊妹们尝尝新。
    今年春天，在开始提出要汉族农民来帮助开辟饲料和粮食基地的时候，牧民们还是有很大顾虑的。人们传说：过去都是因为汉人开荒，占了我们的土地，我们的草原才一年一年缩小了。有的牧民担心：在草地种庄稼以后，咱们的牲畜到哪里放牧呢？干部们反复宣传说明种植饲料和粮食，正是为了更好地发展牧业生产。再说，侵占土地，欺侮蒙古人，那是旧社会的事。如今咱们新中国是各民族友爱的大家庭，咱们请汉人来帮助，干完活人家就走了，种下地是咱们自己的，咱们学下技术谁也拿不走。
    事实没有辜负他们的期望。秋收以后，牧民纷纷谈论着：明年咱们再多种些粮食和蔬菜。慢慢在土地上扎下根，定居下来，人和牲畜的生活就都有保障了。
    来到草原上帮助耕作的汉族农民，以自己的辛勤劳动和热诚的服务精神，获得了蒙古族弟兄的爱戴。他们平日起早贪黑干活，耐心地教技术；遇到风雨天不能下地，就帮助牧民收拾牲畜棚圈，给喇嘛们泥抹房子，修火炕。金星社附近住的几户喇嘛，都在农民的帮助下种了蔬菜，还打了一眼水井。牧民说：“这些汉族老大哥是真心实意来帮助咱们的。”在过端阳节和中秋节的时候，金星社的牧民和当地的喇嘛们，给汉族农民杀了肥羊，抬去了大桶的奶酒，大家在一起热闹地吃呵，唱呵！跟他们学习种地的五位蒙古族弟兄，一起举杯歌唱着：
    你们林西县来的汉族兄长呵，
    请喝下这杯感谢的酒吧！
    眼看我们在草原上种出了庄稼，
    如今我们的两手学到了本领，
    这是自古未有的大喜事呵！
    当秋收还没有完的时候，金星社的主任基格木德就同汉族农民商量，希望他们留下一两个人，在当地安家落户参加生产。（附图片）
