    We Are Not Powerless Before Nature

    This year, Gansu Province, on the basis of agricultural cooperativization, launched an unprecedented large-scale farmland water conservancy construction campaign, and at the same time improved farming techniques; as a result, grain, cotton, and oil crops all achieved bumper harvests. Facts have proven that the working people, organized under the leadership of the Party, have enormous power and can accomplish many things that people previously thought impossible.
    By Our Reporter Kang Weizhong

    It is not an exaggeration to describe this year's agricultural harvest in Gansu with the phrase "every family celebrates a good harvest, every household's granary is full." In Gansu, from the Hexi Corridor, where it "snows at all times" and the climate is cold, to Yinchuan, known as the "Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall," with its fragrant rice paddies stretching for eight hundred miles; from the Dingxi area, which used to be "plagued by drought every year and disaster every season," to the Wudu Special District, with its high mountains, abundant rainfall, and spring-like weather all year round; from the vast and fertile Longdong, to the Tianshui Special District, with its crisscrossing mountains and soil and water conservation transforming the mountainous landscape; almost every county, district, and township in the province's 530,000 square kilometers of land has had a bumper harvest. This year, the increase in grain production and the size of the harvest area are unprecedented. According to preliminary estimates by relevant departments, the total grain output of the province reached 11.7 billion jin; the original plan was to increase production by 2.5 billion jin, but the actual increase was 3.33 billion jin. The province's cotton production reached 350,000 dan; the original plan was to increase production by 150,000 dan, but the actual increase was 240,000 dan. In this way, the main agricultural indicators stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan for the province have been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded: grain production exceeded by 41.2%, and cotton exceeded by 203.53%.

    The huge harvest has greatly increased the income of most agricultural cooperative members. In the Yinchuan Special District, each farmer can receive an average of 1,291 jin of grain. In Taole County, farmers, in addition to sideline income, have an average net income of 1,330 jin per person from grain alone. This is unprecedented in local history. Tens of thousands of immigrants from Beijing, Shanghai, and Henan also received the fruits of their labor for the first time. Now, many farmers' homes are piled high with grain, it can truly be said that "small granaries are full and large granaries overflow," everyone is smiling and celebrating the bumper harvest. In many areas, farmers have a surplus of reserve grain in addition to what they eat, hand over as public grain, and sell as state-procured grain. For example, in Dingxi Special District, the most famous drought-stricken area in the province, every farmer's household has more than half a year's worth of food reserves. In Zhangxian County's Wuxing Agricultural Production Cooperative, each member of the cooperative has enough grain in reserve for a year and a half. This year, Gansu has become the first province to be self-sufficient in grain, cotton, and oil crops, with a surplus to spare.

    When people celebrate the harvest, they naturally think about the reasons for this year's success.

    A leading comrade from the Gansu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry said: "The harvest - there is no other strange reason, mainly because all our rural cadres have gone from not understanding to understanding the characteristics of Gansu's agriculture, and have mastered it on the basis of cooperativization. What are the characteristics of Gansu's agriculture? This is: on the one hand, it is a drought-prone area. 78% of the province's cultivated land is dry land, the climate is dry, and the average annual rainfall is only about 300 mm, and in the central and western regions it is less than 300 mm, and the rainfall is mostly concentrated in the autumn; therefore, it is often threatened by severe droughts. On the other hand, the province's water resources are very rich. According to surveys and estimates, surface water is about 60 billion cubic meters, plus groundwater and rainwater, the amount is even greater. If fully utilized, all of the province's existing 70 million mu of cultivated land can be turned into irrigated land. In Gansu, how to fully utilize all water resources such as river water, rainwater, and groundwater has become the key issue for increasing agricultural production. In the past, we did not have enough understanding of this, and we emphasized the difficulties of Gansu being bare, with sparse rainfall, etc., and did not pay attention to the favorable aspects such as the rich water resources and huge potential of the province. Therefore, we showed powerlessness in the face of nature. As time went by, and as some local cadres and the masses spontaneously made some achievements in changing the natural landscape, we gradually realized the importance of fully utilizing water resources to change the drought-stricken landscape. Many workers realized: 'In Gansu, there is no agriculture without water conservancy.' All cadres and farmers have enthusiastically devoted themselves to water conservancy work."

    "Agricultural cooperativization has played a huge and beneficial role in changing the natural landscape. It has not only stimulated the farmers' high enthusiasm for production, but also enabled the collective wisdom and strength of the farmers to be better brought into play. Things that were considered impossible in the past can now be done. From the winter of last year to the spring of this year, under the leadership of local Party and government leading organs, farmers throughout the province, based on the characteristics of the region, launched an unprecedented large-scale water conservancy construction campaign. In the Hexi Corridor and the large-area irrigation areas of Yinchuan, farmers made full use of the Yellow River water and the snow water from the Qilian Mountains. On both sides of the Yellow River, large and small crisscrossing canals, dams, water diversion, and water lifting irrigation projects have been successfully built. In order to prevent the snow water from the Qilian Mountains from being lost and leaked in large quantities during irrigation, the farmers in the Hexi Corridor created channels paved with pebbles. These pebble-paved channels, after being washed by fine sand and small stones in the flowing water and subjected to water penetration, harden over time and have strong resistance to erosion, freezing, and leakage, greatly saving agricultural water consumption. In the Bailong River and Xihan River basin areas in southern Gansu, according to the characteristics of abundant rainfall, abundant water sources, and water sources mostly located in the mountains, methods were adopted to drain and store water in the mountains, and to divert and irrigate river valleys and terraced fields on the mountainside, which solved the natural contradiction of using water on the top of the mountains, the mountainside, and the plains, so that the top of the mountains, the mountainside, and the bottom of the mountains all achieved bumper harvests. In the hilly and plateau areas, 80%-90% of the land is dry land, and rainfall is mostly concentrated in the autumn. In order to solve the problem of severe soil erosion there, horizontal ditches were generally dug on the mountains, terraced fields were built, embankments were built along the edges of the fields, flood control dams were built, grass was cultivated and forests were planted, and floods were diverted for irrigation. In the arid areas with sparse rainfall in the central region, according to the characteristics of insufficient water sources and low groundwater levels, methods of diverting water and lifting water for irrigation were adopted, and springs were dug, wells were drilled, and sandy fields were laid to preserve moisture and resist drought... "

    In every region and every corner of Gansu, the broad masses of farmers have plunged into the high tide of agricultural capital construction. According to statistics, this year more than 1.5 million male and female laborers in the province have been invested in water conservancy construction; the irrigated area expanded due to the renovation of water conservancy projects reached 5.3 million mu, equivalent to 145% of the total irrigated area increased in the province in the six years after liberation; the area of soil erosion controlled due to soil and water conservation reached 14,800 square kilometers, equal to twice the total area of soil erosion controlled in the five years from 1951 to 1955; the area of afforestation is equal to four and a half times the total area of afforestation in the six years after liberation. As a result of doing these things, 103 of the 550 drought-stricken townships in the province have begun to get rid of the threat of drought this year. According to past surveys and statistics, dry land generally increases grain production by one to three times after being converted into irrigated land; after slope land is converted into terraced fields, the average increase in grain production is one-half to one time. Take Gaoya Township in Yuzhong County, which has already been transformed, as an example: in 1953, this township had an average of only one-tenth of a mu of irrigated land per three people, and 82% of the households in the township were short of food that year; now, each person has an average of more than one mu of irrigated land, and every farmer's household in the township can not only be self-sufficient, but also sell more than 300,000 jin of grain to the state. According to the materials from the recent provincial agricultural work conference, Zhangye County, Linxia City, and Wuzhong City have an average wheat yield of more than 500 jin per mu; Linze County, Dunhuang County, Zhongning County, and other 26 counties and cities have an average of more than 300 jin per mu. In terms of yield per unit area, according to incomplete statistics from 32 counties and cities, there are more than 34,000 mu of high-yielding wheat with a yield of more than 800 jin per mu, and 775 mu with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu. These vivid facts powerfully illustrate the great role of doing a good job in agricultural capital construction and fully exploiting and utilizing water sources in increasing agricultural production!

    Of course, these are not the only reasons for the increase in agricultural production in Gansu this year. Much work has also been done in improving farming techniques and promoting advanced experience. Many areas have changed low-yield crops to high-yield crops, and changed broadcasting to row sowing; the rational close planting of wheat, the square hole sowing of corn, and the plum blossom planting of potatoes have been promoted; topdressing and fertilizer-seed mixing methods of fertilization have been promoted; and good methods such as ridge irrigation, ditch irrigation, and comb-ridge irrigation have been implemented in irrigation; some improved varieties have also been promoted... These measures have undoubtedly played a certain role in increasing yield per unit area.

    我们在大自然面前不是无能为力的
    甘肃省今年在农业合作化的基础上掀起了规模空前巨大的兴修农田水利运动，同时改进了耕作技术；结果，粮食、棉花、油料全面大丰产。事实证明：在党的领导下组织起来的劳动人民有巨大无比的力量，能够办到许多过去人们认为办不到的事情。本报记者　康伟中
    用“家家庆丰收，户户粮满仓”这句话来形容今年甘肃农业丰收的景象，一点也不过分。在甘肃，从“四时下雪”、气候寒冷的河西走廊，到号称“塞上江南”、八百里平川稻米香的银川，从过去“年年闹旱、季季闹灾”的定西地区，到高山多雨，四季如春的武都专区，从辽阔肥沃、一望无垠的陇东，到山脉纵横、用水土保持改变着山区面貌的天水专区；在全省五十三万平方公里的土地上，几乎每县、每区、每乡都丰收了。今年，粮食增产之多，丰收面积之大，是从来没有过的。根据有关部门的初步估计，全省粮食总产量达到一百一十七亿斤；原计划增产二十五亿斤，实际增产三十三亿三千万斤。全省棉花产量达到三十五万担；原计划增产十五万担，实际增产二十四万担。这样，第一个五年计划所规定的全省农业方面的主要指标，都提前和超额完成了：粮食产量超额41.2％，棉花超额203.53％。
    巨大的丰收使得绝大部分农业合作社社员的收入有很大增加。在银川专区，平均每个农民可以分到一千二百九十一斤粮食。陶乐县农民除副业收入外，光粮食一项每人平均净收入一千三百三十斤。这是当地历史上从来没有过的。几万来自北京、上海和河南的移民，也第一次分到了丰盛的劳动果实。现在，许多农民家里堆放着大批粮食，真可说是“小囤满来大囤流”，人人喜笑颜开，庆贺大丰收。许多地区的农民，除食用、交公粮、出售统购粮外，都剩余了一部分储备粮。如全省最著名的干旱地区——定西专区，每户农民都有半年以上的口粮储备。漳县五星农业生产合作社，今年全社每个社员储备的粮食足够一年半食用。甘肃今年第一次成为粮食、棉花和油料自给自足而且有余的省份。
    人们在喜庆丰收的时候，自然要联想一下今年丰收的由来。
    甘肃农林厅一位负责同志这样说：“丰收——没有别的奇特原因，主要是我们全体农村干部对甘肃农业特点由不认识到认识，并且在合作化的基础上掌握了它。什么是甘肃农业的特点呢？这就是：一方面，它是一个干旱地区。全省78％耕地面积是旱地，气候干燥，平均年雨量只有三百公厘左右，在中部、西部地区还不到三百公厘，而且降雨量多集中在秋季；因此，经常遭受严重的旱灾威胁。另一方面，全省的水利资源却很丰富。据调查估算，地面水约有六百亿方，加上地下水和雨水，数量就更多了，只要充分利用，就可以把全省现有的七千万亩耕地全部变成水浇地。在甘肃，如何把河水、雨水、地下水等一切水利资源充分加以利用，就成为农业增产的关键问题。过去我们对这认识不足，一味强调甘肃光山秃秃、雨量稀少等困难方面，而没有注意到全省水利资源丰富、潜力巨大等有利方面，因而在大自然面前表现出无能为力。随着时间的推移，随着有些地方干部和群众自发地在改变自然面貌方面作出了一些成绩，我们才逐渐认识到充分利用水利资源改变干旱面貌的重要性。许多工作人员认识了：‘在甘肃，没有水利就没有农业。’全体干部和农民都满怀信心地投入了水利工作。”
    “农业合作化对于改变自然面貌发挥了巨大的有利作用。它不仅激发了农民生产的高度热情，而且使农民的集体智慧和力量更好地发挥出来了，过去认为办不到的事情可以办到了。从去冬今春开始，全省农民在各地党政领导机关的领导下，根据地区特点，掀起了规模空前巨大的兴修水利运动。在河西走廊、银川大面积灌溉地区，农民充分利用黄河水和祁连山的雪水。在黄河两岸，纵横交错的大小水渠、河坝、引水和提水灌溉工程已经修筑成功了。为了不使祁连山的雪水在灌溉的时候大量流失和渗漏，河西走廊的农民创造了用卵石补砌的渠道。这种卵石补砌的渠道，经过流水中的细沙、小石冲灌和水的渗压作用，日久便行硬化，有很强的抗冲、抗冻和防漏作用，大大节约了农田用水量。在甘肃南部的白龙江、西汉水流域地区，根据那里的雨量充足、水源旺盛、水源地多在山上的特点，采用了在山上排水储水、引灌川地和半山梯田的办法，解决了山顶、山腰和平川利用水的自然矛盾，使山上、山腰、山下都得到了丰收。在丘陵和高原地带，那里有80％——90％是旱地，而且降雨量多集中在秋季。为了解决那里的严重水土流失问题，曾在山上普遍挖水平沟，修梯田、培地边埂，打起拦洪坝，育草植林，引洪灌溉。在中部雨量稀少的干旱地区，根据这里水源不足、地下水位低的特点，采用了引水、提水灌溉的办法，并且挖泉、打井和铺砂田保墒抗旱。……”
    在甘肃每一个地区，每一个角落，广大农民都投入了农业基本建设的高潮。据统计，今年全省投入水利建设的男女劳动力就达到一百五十万以上；因整修水利工程而扩大的灌溉面积达五百三十万亩，相当于解放后六年来全省增加的灌溉面积总和的145％；因为作好水土保持而所控制的水土流失面积达到了一万四千八百平方公里，等于1951——1955年五年中控制水土流失面积总和的两倍；植树造林面积等于解放后六年造林总面积的四倍半。做了这些工作的结果是：在全省五百五十个干旱乡中，从今年开始有一百零三个乡摆脱了干旱的威胁。根据过去的调查统计，旱地变水浇地之后，一般要增产粮食一倍到三倍；由坡地变梯田之后，平均要增产粮食一半到一倍。拿已经改造的榆中县高崖乡作例子：这个乡1953年平均三人只有一分水地，当年全乡82％的户缺粮；现在，每人平均已有一亩多水浇地，全乡每个农户不仅可以自给自足，还可以卖给国家三十多万斤粮食。根据最近全省农业工作会议的材料，小麦平均亩产在五百斤以上的有张掖县、临夏市和武忠市；平均在三百斤以上的有临泽县、敦煌县、中宁县等二十六个县市。就单位面积产量来说，据三十二个县、市不完全统计，亩产八百斤以上的丰产小麦有三万四千多亩，亩产千斤以上的有七百七十五亩。这些生动的事实，有力地说明了搞好农业基本建设，充分挖掘和利用水源，对农业增产有多么重大的作用！
    当然，今年甘肃农业增产的原因不只是这些。在改进耕作技术、推广先进经验方面也作了许多工作。许多地区改低产作物为高产作物，改撒播为条播；推广了小麦的合理密植，包谷的方形穴播，洋芋的梅花点种；施肥方法上的施窝肥、施追肥和肥料拌种；在灌溉方面的实行畦灌、沟灌和梳垅灌等好方法；还推广了一些良种……。这些措施，无疑地对提高单位面积产量也起了一定的作用。
