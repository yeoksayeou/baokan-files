Put That "Dead Mackerel" Away!

    The Anglo-French invading forces have not yet completely withdrawn from Egypt, and they, along with the United States, are already busy planning to seize the Suez Canal by other means. During the recent meeting of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc council, the United States, Britain, and France held secret talks on the Suez Canal issue. According to revealed information, the United States has reached an "agreement" with Britain and France, insisting on making "canal management free from political influence" and using the so-called "Eighteen-Nation Plan" to implement "international control" over the Suez Canal.
    Everyone knows that the "Eighteen-Nation Plan" was met with strong opposition from Egypt and all countries advocating international justice as soon as it was proposed. This plan is a naked infringement on Egyptian sovereignty and was even rejected by the United Nations General Assembly. It was after the failure of this conspiracy that the Anglo-French aggressors launched the war of aggression against Egypt. But this war of aggression has now failed shamefully. The Anglo-French invading forces, which triumphantly marched into Egypt, now have to leave Egyptian territory in dejection. Therefore, the so-called "Eighteen-Nation Plan," as Indian Prime Minister Nehru said, is already a dead mackerel.
    However, Britain and France still want to peddle this dead mackerel together with the United States today. They are truly blinded by profit and overestimate themselves. They have not thought that what they could not obtain on the battlefield with two thousand sorties of aircraft and more than one hundred warships, how could they possibly obtain at the conference table?
    Of course, without the support of the United States, Britain and France would not dare to bring out this bankrupt "Eighteen-Nation Plan" again. After Britain and France announced the withdrawal of their invading forces from Egypt, the United States actively colluded with Britain and France to become enemies of the people of the Middle East, trying to seize the Suez Canal from the hands of the Egyptian people. The United States announced an emergency oil aid plan for Britain and France, provided loans to Britain to solve its financial difficulties, and repeatedly expressed its support for the Baghdad Pact, which aims to undermine the unity of Arab countries. The so-called "Eighteen-Nation Plan" was originally created by the United States to facilitate its own intervention in the Suez Canal issue and to deprive Egypt of its sovereignty over the Suez Canal together with Britain and France. The United States is now bringing out this "plan" again with Britain and France, obviously wanting to use this "plan" to gain the initiative on the Suez Canal issue, squeeze out Britain and France, and further extend its aggressive hand into the Middle East. For Britain and France, after the failure of their aggression against Egypt, being able to use this "plan" supported by the United States to maintain some colonial interests in the Suez Canal is naturally what they desire.
    Before the Anglo-French invading forces completely withdraw from Egyptian territory, there is no question of the operation and management of the Suez Canal. As long as there is one soldier from Britain and France on Egyptian territory, the canal cannot be cleared, and navigation cannot be realized. This is the clear attitude that the Egyptian government and people have repeatedly expressed. Therefore, the problem that Britain and France should consider at present is to withdraw their invading forces from Egypt as soon as possible, and not the issue of canal operation and management.
    The operation and management of the Suez Canal are matters within the scope of Egyptian sovereignty and do not require Britain, France, and the United States to worry about at all. The issue of ensuring the free navigation of the Suez Canal must be resolved through peaceful negotiations on the basis of respecting Egyptian sovereignty, in accordance with the six principles adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. We advise the colonialist masters of Britain, France, and the United States to put away your dead mackerel of the "Eighteen-Nation Plan." No one will appreciate your stinking goods now!

### 把那条“死鲭鱼”收起来吧！

    把那条“死鲭鱼”收起来吧！
    英法侵略埃及的军队尚未撤完，它们就同美国在忙着计划要用另外的办法来夺取苏伊士运河了。在北大西洋侵略集团理事会最近开会期间，美英法三国就苏伊士运河问题进行了密谈，据透露出来的消息说，美国已经和英法达成了“协议”，它们坚持要使“运河管理摆脱政治影响”，要用所谓“十八国计划”来对苏伊士运河实行“国际管制”。
    谁都知道，“十八国计划”刚刚提出的时候，就遭到了埃及和一切主张国际正义的国家的强烈反对。这个计划是个赤裸裸地侵犯埃及主权的计划，甚至在联合国大会上也遭到了摈弃。英法侵略者正是在这个阴谋失败之后，才发动了对埃及的侵略战争。但是这个侵略战争现在已经可耻地失败了，耀武扬威地开进埃及的英法侵略军，现在不得不垂头丧气地从埃及的领土上滚出去。因此，所谓“十八国计划”，正像印度总理尼赫鲁所说的，这已经是一条死鲭鱼。
    可是，英法今天还想同美国一道来推销这条死鲭鱼。它们真是利令智昏，太不自量力了。它们没有想想，用二千架次飞机和一百多条军舰在战场上所没有得到的东西，在会议桌上怎么可能得到呢？
    当然，没有美国的支持，英法是不敢重新拿出这个已经破产的“十八国计划”来的。在英法宣布从埃及撤退侵略军队以后，美国便积极伙同英法来与中东人民为敌，力图从埃及人民手里夺取苏伊士运河。美国宣布了一个石油紧急支援英法的计划，贷款给英国解决它的财政困难，还一再表示支持旨在破坏阿拉伯国家团结的巴格达集团。所谓“十八国计划”本来就是美国一手制造出来的，目的就是便于它自己插手苏伊士运河问题，同英法一道剥夺埃及对苏伊士运河的主权。美国现在又同英法搬出这个“计划”来，显然是想利用这个“计划”来取得在苏伊士运河问题上的主动地位，排挤英法，使它的侵略的手进一步伸进中东。在英法来说，它们在侵埃战争失败以后，能利用美国支持的这个“计划”，在苏伊士运河维持一点殖民利益，当然是求之不得的。
    在英法侵略部队完全撤出埃及领土以前，是根本谈不到什么苏伊士运河的经营管理问题的。只要英法在埃及领土上还有一个士兵，运河就不能清理，通航就不能实现。这是埃及政府和人民一再表示过的鲜明态度。因此，英法当前应该考虑的问题，是尽快从埃及撤出它们的侵略军队，而不是什么运河经营管理问题。
    苏伊士运河的经营管理问题，是埃及主权范围以内的事情，根本用不着英法和美国操心。保证苏伊士运河自由通航问题，是要根据联合国大会所通过的六项原则，在尊重埃及主权基础上，通过和平谈判求得解决。奉劝英法和美国的殖民主义老爷们，还是把你们那条“十八国计划”的死鲭鱼收起来吧，现在不会有人赏识你们那种臭气熏天的货色的！
