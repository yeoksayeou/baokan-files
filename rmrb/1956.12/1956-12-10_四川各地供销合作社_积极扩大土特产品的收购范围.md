    Sichuan's Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Various Regions
　　Actively Expand the Scope of Procurement of Local and Special Products
    (Our Dispatch) Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Sichuan have discovered 185 new varieties of minor local and special products this year. Many of these products are urgently needed industrial raw materials for the current industrial sector. Among them, 23 types have been confirmed for their usefulness through trial production and can be widely expanded for procurement. For example, Yanbian County produces 5 million jin of Eulaliopsis binata grass annually, which the masses used to cut and burn as firewood. After the supply and marketing cooperative's identification, it can be used for papermaking, and a supply contract has been signed with a paper mill in Hubei Province. Farmers can increase their income by 400,000 yuan annually by selling Eulaliopsis binata grass. In the third quarter of this year, 16 new varieties such as ramie, willow jute, wild vines, incense fruit, Caesalpinia sappan fruit, and refractory clay were also discovered. The procurement of these new commodities has started from the fourth quarter. Wild plants such as Rubia cordifolia and acorn cups discovered in Fuling and Jiangjin prefectures are rich in glue content and are good raw materials for manufacturing roasted glue. These are now being procured in various producing areas. Smilax china discovered in Qionglai County can be used as a raw material for papermaking after processing, and it can also replace hemp for rope making and be used by the construction sector as warp threads, with a value one-third lower than hemp. The county plans to purchase 25 million jin this year. Currently, this local product has been used as a raw material for rope making in Chongqing, Tianjin, and other places, and the Chengdu construction sector has also begun to use it in large quantities.
    At present, cadres have been dispatched to various places to specifically help farmers learn the picking and processing of the above-mentioned local and special products. (Tian Yu)

    四川各地供销合作社
　　积极扩大土特产品的收购范围
    本报讯　四川各地供销社今年新发现了一百八十五个小宗土特产品新品种，这些产品中有很多都是当前工业部门急需的工业原料。其中经过试制肯定了用途，可以普遍扩大收购的就有二十三种。如盐边全县年产蓑草五百万斤，群众过去都割来当柴烧，经供销社鉴定，它可以造纸，已同湖北省造纸厂签订了供应合同。农民出售蓑草每年可增加四十万元收入。今年三季度还发现桑麻、柳麻、土藤、香章果、黄金子、耐火坭等十六个新品种，从第四季度起已开始收购这些新商品。在涪陵、江津等专区发现的红根、橡碗等野生植物，含胶量丰富，是制造烤胶的好原料。现在各个产区都在收购它。邛崃县发现的牛藤，经过加工可作造纸原料，也可以代替大麻制绳和供建筑部门作大麻经使用，价值比大麻低三分之一以上，全县今年计划收购二千五百万斤。目前这个土产品已被重庆、天津等地作为制绳原料，成都市建筑部门也开始大量使用。
    目前，各地都派出了干部具体帮助农民学会上述土特产品的采摘和加工工作。（田雨）
