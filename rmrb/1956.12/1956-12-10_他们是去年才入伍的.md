　　They Enlisted Just Last Year
    First Escort Battle
    A fleet laden with cargo was sailing south in the blue sea, riding the wind and waves.
    Escort soldier Ji Xuelin stood by the gun position on the deck, gazing at the scattered mountain peaks on the distant mainland to the right. He recalled that in March 1955, he was still a carpenter in his hometown, but now he was a Public Security Forces soldier protecting the safety of transport ships, sailing on the seas of the motherland. He said to his comrade standing beside him, "Time flies, it's been nine months!"
    For a new soldier, these nine months were indeed an extraordinary period. When Ji Xuelin first came on board, he felt dizzy and nauseous as soon as the ship set sail, but he was not intimidated by the wind, waves, and difficulties. Overcoming these obstacles, he quickly adapted to life at sea. With the help of officers and veteran soldiers, he had already skillfully mastered the weapons in his hands.
    One day, after the fleet sailed to a certain port and anchored, they suddenly received a report: eight Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes were stealthily flying towards this sea area.
      "Shoot them down!" Ji Xuelin glared angrily, and he and his comrades immediately prepared for battle.
    The enemy planes flew over the fleet, diving straight down. Bullets rained down on the sea surface. The escort troops concentrated their firepower to shoot at the enemy aircraft, and the coastal anti-aircraft artillery brother units also supported with artillery fire. Shell bursts exploded around the enemy planes. The first batch of enemy planes was driven away, and the second batch followed closely, diving down. Dense bullets swept over Ji Xuelin's head and around him, but he was not timid or frightened because it was his first time participating in battle. He only thought in his heart, "Hit the enemy hard!" and continued to track and shoot at the target.
    After a burst of frantic dive-bombing, the enemy planes dropped bombs one by one. A bomb landed only two meters away from Ji Xuelin on the sea surface. A black column of water shot high into the sky, splashing onto the deck and then breaking into the sea, enveloping the ship in smoke. At this moment, Ji Xuelin's machine gun suddenly malfunctioned, and the bullets wouldn't fire. He was initially flustered, but then calmed down and, following the instructions of the veteran comrades, quickly fixed the problem in a matter of seconds. Just then, another enemy plane dived down from the left side of the ship. Ji Xuelin immediately pulled the trigger, "Da-da-da," a burst of bullets hit it head-on, severely damaging the enemy plane and forcing it to turn back.
    The battle was intense, and the enemy planes dropped more than ten bombs on the fleet one after another. A communication soldier, steadfast in his post, bravely sacrificed his life. The flames of revenge burned in Ji Xuelin's heart. He gritted his teeth, glared at the enemy planes, and wished he could crush them to pieces with his bare hands. At this time, the ammunition handler next to him was transferred to the anti-aircraft gun, leaving him alone by the machine gun. He shot with one hand and held the ammunition belt with the other, without stopping, continuing to operate the weapon and firing fiercely at the enemy planes.
    Suddenly, our valiant warplanes arrived. The enemy planes, seeing that the situation was bad, tried desperately to escape, but it was too late, they had to be punished! Under the combined attack of our air and ground fire, one enemy plane was hit and fled southeast, and another was shot down and plunged straight into the sea. The remaining enemy planes also fled in a panic. Ji Xuelin felt the joy of victory for the first time. He was determined to achieve even greater victories and make contributions to the motherland.

    Be Worthy of This Gun
    Wu Wei enlisted with excitement. He was not used to anything in the army at first. He had to get up early to run and drill, and also attend classes. The north wind whistled against his body, and he felt a little cold. After standing on the drill ground for less than two hours, his legs began to ache. After drill and class, he would lie on the bed and didn't want to do anything. The squad leader noticed that he was in a bad mood and took the initiative to talk to him, saying kindly, "You're new here, you're not used to it, you'll get better slowly." Other comrades also said: as long as you study hard and acquire skills, we can help you with any difficulties. As for the squad's errands and duties, we'll take care of them.
    He carefully chewed on the words of his comrades, and at night, when everyone was snoring, he was still tossing and turning, even the events before liberation flooded into his mind. The final conclusion was: no matter how hard it is now, it's not as hard as before liberation; I should learn my skills well to protect our happy life and protect the motherland!
    Wu Wei was extremely happy on the day the guns were issued. When he returned to the squad, he went to clean his gun. As soon as he pulled back the bolt, a small paper roll fell out. He opened it and read:
    Dear Comrade, a soldier who didn't like to study once used the gun you now have. One night he was on duty, and two special agents suddenly appeared. After he discovered them, he fired three shots in a row, but all the bullets missed, not a single one hit. He hurriedly jumped over, intending to grab the special agents. Unexpectedly, the enemy opened fire at this moment, and he was wounded and fell down....
    Dear Comrade, you must remember this lesson and not be unworthy of this gun like he was....
    Every word here touched Wu Wei's heart. But after practicing rifle aiming for several days, his performance was still the worst. The squad leader explained the essentials over and over again, and demonstrated the movements time after time, but when it came to individual practice, his hands would tremble when he held the gun, and he couldn't close his left eye. He aimed again and again, but always failed. With no other choice, Wu Wei resolved to study hard and practice diligently. He practiced while eating, and even when he went to bed. His hands were sore and aching, and his new cotton coat was also worn out. Sometimes he felt very tired, but when he saw that gun and the veteran soldiers, he regained his strength. Later, he also made a plan, and studied hard and practiced diligently according to the plan. Half a year later, his performance improved significantly. He improved from failing to excellent in live-fire shooting, received more than ten large and small awards, and was promoted to Private First Class, receiving a commendation throughout the regiment.

　　他们是去年才入伍的
    第一次护航战斗
    一个满载货物的船队，在蓝色的大海中，乘风破浪地向南航行。
    护航战士季学林站在甲板上的炮位旁，凝视着右方远处大陆上的点点山头，他想起1955年3月间还在家乡做木工，而现在却已成为保护运输船只安全，航行在祖国海洋上的公安军战士了。他对站在他身旁的战友说：“时间过得真快，九个月啦！”
    对于一个新战士来说，这九个月确是一个不平凡的时期。季学林乍到船上来时，船一出航就头晕脑胀，但是他没有被风浪和困难吓倒，克服了困难，很快地习惯了海上生活。他在军官和老战士的帮助下，已经熟练地掌握了手中的武器。
    一天，船队驶到某港口停泊后，突然接到报告：八架蒋贼飞机偷偷地向这一带海面飞来。
      “把它揍下来！”季学林愤愤地圆瞪着眼睛，和战友们立刻作好战斗准备。
    敌机飞临船队的上空，直向着船队俯冲下来。子弹像雨点似地落在海面上。护航部队集中火力射击敌人机群，沿海的高射炮兄弟部队也用炮火支援，弹花就在敌机左右爆炸。第一批敌机被打走了，第二批又紧接着俯冲下来。密集的子弹掠过季学林的头顶、身边，但是他并没有因为第一次参加战斗而胆怯、恐惧，心里只是想到：“要沉重地打击敌人！”继续追捕着射击的目标。
    敌机在一阵疯狂的俯冲扫射以后，接着把炸弹一颗颗投下来。一颗炸弹落在离季学林只两公尺的海面上，黑色的水柱高高地冲上天空，抛在甲板上，又跌碎在海里，船上一片烟雾。就在这时候，季学林的机枪突然发生了故障，子弹发射不出去。他开初有些着慌，但随即又镇定下来，按照老同志教给他的要领，迅速地在几秒钟的时间里排除了故障。刚好一架敌机又从船的左方俯冲下来，季学林立即扣动击发机，“哒哒哒”，一梭子子弹，迎头给了它一顿痛击，打得那架敌机连忙回头了。
    战斗在剧烈的进行中，敌机接二连三地朝着船队投下了十余颗炸弹。一个坚守在岗位上的通讯兵英勇地牺牲了，复仇的火焰燃烧在季学林的心头，他咬紧牙，怒视着敌机，真恨不得一手把它捏个粉碎。这时，他旁边的弹药手又被调到机关炮那里去了，机枪旁只剩下他一个人。他一手射击，一手托着弹带，没有停息，继续操纵着武器，向敌机猛烈地射击。
    突然，我们矫健的战鹰赶到了。敌机见势不妙，想拚命逃窜，但是晚了，要惩罚它！在我空中和地面炮火的夹击下，一架敌机中弹，向东南逃去，接着又有一架被击中，直坠入海，其余的敌机也都狼狈地溜走了。季学林第一次感到战斗胜利的喜悦，他决心要取得更大的胜利，为祖国立功。
                        （周明初）
    要对得起这支枪
    吴伟怀着兴奋的心情入伍了。部队的一切，他开始都不习惯。天不亮就得起床跑步、出操，还要上课。北风飕飕地吹在身上，心里有些发冷。在操场上站不到两个钟头，他的腿就觉得发痛。下操、下课以后，他就往床上一躺，什么事也不愿做。班长发现他的情绪不好，就主动找他谈话，亲切地说：“刚来嘛，不习惯，慢慢就会好的。”别的同志也都说：只要努力学本领，有困难我们可以帮助你，至于班上的公差、勤务都由我们做。
    他细心咀嚼着同志们的一言一语，晚上大家都呼呼地睡着了，他还在翻来复去地想，连解放前的事也涌进了他的脑海。最后的结论是：现在怎么苦，也没有解放前苦；我应该学好本领，保卫幸福生活，保卫祖国！
    发枪的那天，吴伟高兴极了。回到班里，他就去擦枪。刚一拉开枪栓，一个小纸卷便随着掉了下来。他打开一看，上面写着：
    亲爱的同志，有个不爱学习的战士，曾经用过你现在拿的这支枪。一天夜里他值班站岗，突然来了两个特务，他发现后，就一连打了三枪，但子弹都打飞了，没一颗中的。他急忙跳过去，打算用手抓特务。没料到敌人这时开枪了，他，却负伤倒了下去……。
    亲爱的同志，你要记着这个教训，不要像他那样对不起这支枪……。
    这里的每一句话，都打动着吴伟的心。但是步枪瞄准练习好几天了，他的成绩还是最差。班长左一遍右一遍地讲要领，一次又一次地做示范动作，可是轮到分头练习时，他一端枪两手就打哆嗦，左眼也闭不上，瞄来瞄去，总是个不及格。没有办法，吴伟就下决心勤学苦练。吃饭时也练，到了床上也练。手练的又酸又痛，新棉衣也被磨破了。有时候他感到很累，但一看到那支枪，看到老战士，就又有了力量。后来，他还订了一个计划，按照计划勤学苦练。半年以后，他的成绩有显著提高，实弹射击从不及格达到了优秀，受到大小奖励十余次，并晋升为上等兵，受到了团内的通报表扬。（丘显康）（附图片）
