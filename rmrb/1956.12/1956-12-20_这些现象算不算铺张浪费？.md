    Are These Phenomena Considered Extravagance and Waste?
    Editor's Note: People's living standards can only gradually improve with the development of production. It should be said that the previous period's publicity about improving living standards in the newspapers was somewhat excessive (for example, the crowded conditions of employee housing cannot be changed in the short term, and this newspaper once published readers' letters and cartoons like "Four Generations Under One Roof," completely attributing the housing shortage to the leadership's bureaucratic indifference to employees' lives, which was inappropriate). In actual work, many departments have also overemphasized improving living standards. Comrade Xu Kang's opinions in this letter are mostly correct, but some opinions are also a bit excessive. For example, during the high tide of the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, the newspaper used the example of Dong Lai Shun to remind everyone to pay attention to preserving and promoting the excellent characteristics of various enterprises, which was very necessary and had educational significance for cadres and the masses.
    Comrade Editor:
    The Second Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee called on us to launch a movement to increase production and practice economy, advocate hard work and plain living, and oppose extravagance and waste. I think this call is very correct and timely. Now I would like to talk about my doubts about some things.
    Since this year, newspapers and periodicals have published many articles promoting eating, drinking, playing, and entertainment. Of course, eating, drinking, playing, and entertainment are also indispensable parts of life and should be discussed. But I doubt whether newspapers, as a weapon of communist education, should use a large amount of space to promote eating, drinking, playing, and entertainment when the people of the whole country are diligently building socialism today? I clearly remember that the People's Daily once used a long article of more than 3,000 words to describe Dong Lai Shun's mutton hotpot. From the types of mutton hotpot to the way to eat it, to the history of mutton hotpot. It was written vividly and with relish. I don't know what educational significance such articles have for the masses? I also remember that the Beijing Daily once wrote lengthy articles, combining poetry and painting, to satirize those female comrades who wore People's Suits, saying they were "evergreen" and "indistinguishable between men and women." I don't know if this kind of criticism is appropriate?
    Not long ago, Beijing held clothing exhibitions and food exhibitions. Of course, these exhibitions played a certain role in improving people's lives. But I doubt whether these exhibitions are a bit out of touch with the masses? When I walked into the food hall of the Beijing Industrial and Handicraft Products Exhibition, I saw fine wines, delicacies, pastries, and candies of all kinds, surpassing the most high-end food stores. But it also gave people another feeling: Has people's living standard already improved to this extent today? Is this kind of exhibition somewhat distant from people's lives today? A few days later, I visited the Beijing Clothing Exhibition. As soon as I entered, I saw a riot of colors, dazzling to the eye, making people feel as if they were on the Shanyin Road, with too many things to take in. Looking closer, the materials of those new-style clothes were either wool or tweed, or silk or satin. Asking the price, some were dozens of yuan a piece, and some were hundreds of yuan a piece, making people sigh in despair. At that time, I wanted to find a few new-style clothes made of inexpensive fabric, but after searching for a long time, I only saw a few uniforms and dresses, placed there coldly and sparsely. The styles were neither novel nor the colors beautiful. It can be seen that the designers of the exhibition did not put effort into fabric clothing. At that time, I thought: Why not design some new-style clothes with inexpensive fabrics? Is it that fabric is not suitable for making new-style clothes? Wool, velvet, silk, and satin are beautiful, but the general public cannot afford them today. I wonder if the responsible comrades of the exhibition have considered these issues?
    In the past year, Beijing has added many large theaters and cinemas, which has greatly enlivened the cultural life of the capital's people. But are the facilities of some theaters and cinemas somewhat extravagant and wasteful? Every time I walk into the hall of the Capital Theater and see those colored marble pillars, I can't help but think: How much labor of skilled construction workers has been spent here? When I see the velvet and satin curtains in the Tianqiao Theater, I can't help but think: What a pity that velvet and satin are used to make curtains? Once I went to a meeting at the Beijing Workers' Club and saw that the receptionists there, the men all wore gray woolen serge uniforms, and the women all wore woolen dresses and high-heeled leather shoes. I thought these must be work clothes prepared by the public. At this time, one cannot help but feel how incompatible these beautiful clothes are with the faded blue cloth uniforms worn by the people attending the meeting? Once I received a notice to attend an evening party. The notice was truly a exquisite work of art, printed on imported laid paper with colorful patterns and decorated with beautiful gold edges, making people reluctant to let go. But when I thought that this exquisite work of art would turn into waste paper in an instant, I couldn't help but feel sorry and angry?
    The above opinions may be somewhat one-sided. But I think they can also be put forward for reference by various relevant parties.

### 这些现象算不算铺张浪费？

专栏：读者来信

    这些现象算不算铺张浪费？
    编者按：人民生活只能随着生产的发展逐步改善，应该说，前一个时期在报纸上宣传生活改善是有些过分的（比如职工住宿的拥挤状况，并不是短时期之内可以改变的，而本报曾经登了一些读者来信和“四世同堂”之类的漫画，把宿舍不足完全归之于领导上不关心职工生活的官僚主义，就是不恰当的）。在实际工作中，不少部门也对生活改善强调得有些过分。徐康同志这封来信的意见多半是对的，但有些意见也过分了一些。比如，在对私营工商业进行社会主义改造的高潮中，报纸以东来顺的情况为例，提醒大家注意保留和发扬各企业的优良特点，是很必要的，对干部和群众不能说没有什么教育意义。编辑同志：
    党的二中全会号召我们开展增产节约运动，提倡艰苦朴素，反对铺张浪费，我认为这个号召非常正确而适时。现在我想谈谈我对一些事情的疑问。
    从今年以来，报刊上出现了许多宣传吃、喝、玩、乐的文章。当然吃、喝、玩、乐也是生活中不可缺少的部分，是应当讨论的问题。但是我怀疑，作为共产主义教育的武器的报纸，当今天全国人民勤俭建设社会主义的时候，是否有必要用大量的篇幅宣传吃、喝、玩、乐？我清楚地记得，人民日报曾经用三千多字的长篇大论来描写东来顺的涮羊肉。从涮羊肉的种类，写到涮羊肉的吃法，写到涮羊肉的历史。写得绘形绘色，津津有味。不知道这样的文章对群众有什么教育意义？我还记得北京日报上曾经连篇累牍、诗画并作、冷嘲热讽那些穿人民装的女同志，说他们是“四季常青”，是“男女不分”，不知道这种批评是否恰当？
    不久以前，北京曾举行了服装展览和食品展览。当然，这些展览对于改善人民生活是起了一定作用的。但是我怀疑这些展览是否有点脱离群众？当我走进北京市工业手工业品种展览会食品馆的时候，但见美酒佳肴，糕点糖果，应有尽有，使最高级的食品店望尘莫及。但是也给人另一种感觉：是否今天人民的生活已经提高到这个程度？这种展览是否和今天人民的生活有些距离？不几天，我又参观了北京市服装展览会，一进门只见万紫千红，五光十色，使人如入山阴道上，应接不暇。走近一看，那些新式服装衣料非毛则呢，非绸则缎，一问价钱，少者数十元一件，多者数百元一件，使人望洋兴叹。当时我想找几件廉价的布料新式服装，但找来找去，只见几件制服和布拉吉，摆在那里冷冷落落，样式既不新颖，颜色亦不美观，可见展览会的设计者并没有在布料服装上下工夫。当时我想：为什么不用廉价的布料设计一些新式服装，难道布料就不适合做新式服装吗？呢、绒、绸、缎美倒是美，只是一般群众今天还穿不起。不知道展览会的负责同志是否考虑了这些问题？
    一年以来，北京市增加了不少大型的剧场影院。使首都人民的文化生活大大活跃。但是有些剧场、影院的设备是否有些铺张浪费？当我每次走进首都剧场的大厅，看到那些彩色大理石的石柱，就不禁想到：这里耗费了多少熟练建筑工人的劳动？当我看到天桥剧场那些用丝绒和软缎做成的窗帘时，就不禁想到：丝绒和软缎用来做窗帘是多么可惜？有次我到北京市工人俱乐部参加一个会议，看到那里的招待员同志，男的一律穿着灰色毛哔叽制服，女的一律穿着毛料布拉吉和高跟皮鞋，我想这一定是公家给准备的工作服。这时不禁使人感觉这些华美的服装和参加大会的人穿的退了色的蓝布制服多么不相调和？有次我接到了一张参加一个晚会的通知，那通知真是一件精美的艺术品，用进口的道林纸精印着彩色的花纹，饰以美丽的金边，真使人不忍释手。但一想到这个精美的艺术品在一刹那间就要变成废纸，不禁感到惋惜，又感到可气？
    以上这些意见，可能有些片面。但我想也可以提出来供给各个有关方面参考。
                              徐康
