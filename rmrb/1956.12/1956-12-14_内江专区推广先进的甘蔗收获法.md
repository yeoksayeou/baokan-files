Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 12th. Neijiang Prefecture in Sichuan Province is vigorously promoting the "Quick Hoe Low Shovel" sugarcane harvesting method. This method can increase sugarcane yield by 300 to 400 jin per mu, resulting in an increased harvest of over 30 million jin of sugarcane for the entire prefecture.

Neijiang Prefecture is a well-known sugarcane producing area in Sichuan Province. Each year, about 100,000 mu of sugarcane fields require the retention of rootstocks in the soil during harvest to serve as seeds for the following spring. In the past, when harvesting this portion of the sugarcane, farmers often simply cut the sugarcane stalks above ground with sickles, neglecting the two to three inches of sugarcane stalks buried in the soil that could still be harvested, resulting in significant losses. The "Quick Hoe Low Shovel" method uses sharpened hoes instead of sickles to deeply shovel into the soil, cutting off a section of the sugarcane stalk above the root sugarcane. This not only increases yield but also plays a significant role in preventing sugarcane borers from overwintering and protecting sugarcane roots from frost damage.

    内江专区推广先进的甘蔗收获法
    新华社成都12日电　四川省内江专区正在大力推广“快锄低铲”的甘蔗收获法。这种方法能使每亩蔗地多收甘蔗三百到四百斤，全专区能多收甘蔗三千多万斤。
    内江专区是四川省著名的甘蔗产地。每年约有十万亩甘蔗在收割时要留下根茎在土里作为明年春季的种子用，过去在收割这部分甘蔗的时候，常常只是用镰刀砍去地面上的蔗茎，忽略了埋在土下面的还可以收割的两三寸长的蔗茎，损失很大。“快锄低铲”方法是用磨快了的锄头代替镰刀深铲入土，将根蔗上面的一段蔗茎也砍下来，这不仅能增加产量，并且对防止蔗螟越冬和保护蔗根不受冻害都有很大作用。
