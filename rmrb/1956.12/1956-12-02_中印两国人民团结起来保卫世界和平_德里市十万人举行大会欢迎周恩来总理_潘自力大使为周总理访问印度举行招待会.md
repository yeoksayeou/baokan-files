Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 1st: On the evening of November 30th, one hundred thousand Delhi citizens crowded into Ramlila Ground, New Delhi's largest square, to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their delegation. This was the grandest welcome they had received since arriving in the Indian capital on November 28th.

Zhou Enlai and Nehru rode in an open car from the Presidential Palace to Ramlila Ground, with crowds packed along both sides of the street. The crowds cheered enthusiastically as the car passed. The route was lined with the national flags of India and China, colorful electric lights, and huge banners with slogans in Hindi and Chinese: "The people of China and India unite to defend world peace"; "The people of China and India learn from each other and exchange experiences."

The majestic Delhi Gate leading to the square was brilliantly illuminated. The trees around the square shimmered with dense electric lights, emitting tens of thousands of red, blue, and light red lights, illuminating the entire square as if it were a fairyland. Many balloons and a huge kite floated in the air, the kite's line fully decorated with the national flags of both countries.

The Chinese Premier spoke to the mass rally from a well-constructed, high, white platform, brightly lit by spotlights. The road leading to the platform in the center of the square was fully decorated with flowers and palm leaves. Large pots of burning sandalwood emitted a fragrant aroma.

Zhou Enlai wore a gold-threaded garland presented to him by the Chairman of the Delhi Municipal Committee, Agrawal, as a symbol of the highest honor. As Zhou Enlai spoke, the vast crowd sitting cross-legged in the square, according to Indian custom, continuously applauded enthusiastically and shouted "Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai" (Indians and Chinese are brothers). Among the crowd were Hindu men wearing white freedom caps, robust Sikhs wearing large turbans, and women wearing beautiful saris with auspicious red dots on their foreheads. There were also rural women from nearby villages, wearing colorful costumes. They came in carts decorated with colored ribbons, singing folk songs.

Chairman of the Municipal Committee, Agrawal, delivered a speech at the beginning of the rally, welcoming Premier Zhou and his delegation. He also presented Zhou Enlai with a red silk scroll with a welcoming address.

Premier Zhou Enlai spoke at the meeting. (Full text to be released separately) At the end of his speech, he said in Hindi: "Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai" (Indians and Chinese are brothers) and "Jai Hind" (Victory to India). These words were echoed by hundreds of thousands of people.

Five hundred guests attended, including Prime Minister Nehru and his daughter, Mrs. Indira Gandhi.

Premier Zhou Enlai freely conversed with the guests for more than an hour, shaking hands and exchanging greetings. Many prominent Indian parliamentarians, writers, and others who had visited China extended special greetings to the Chinese Premier, reminiscing about their friendship after separation. At the reception, which was filled with such sincere and warm atmosphere, the Premier reunited with some old friends and made some new acquaintances. Yuvraj Karan Singh, the head of Jammu and Kashmir State, warmly shook hands with Premier Zhou Enlai and expressed his regret that Kashmir was not included in the Premier's itinerary for this visit.

    新华社新德里1日电　11月30日傍晚，德里市民十万人挤满了新德里最大的广场拉姆利拉广场，来欢迎周恩来总理和贺龙副总理等一行。这是他们在11月28日到达印度首都以来所受到的最盛大的欢迎。
    周恩来和尼赫鲁乘着敞篷车从总统府驶向拉姆利拉广场，街道两旁挤满着群众。当汽车开过的时候，群众发出十分热烈的欢呼。沿途挂满了印中两国的国旗、彩色的电灯、以及巨幅的布幔，上面写着印地文和中文的字句：中印两国人民团结起来保卫世界和平；中印两国人民互相学习和交流经验。
    通向广场的巍峨的德生门灯光辉煌。广场四周的树丛中闪烁着密密麻麻的电灯，发出千万道红色、蓝色和浅红色的灯光，把整个广场照耀得如同仙境。空中飘着许多气球和一个巨大的风筝，风筝的线上满挂着两国国旗。
    中国总理在建造得很精致的高高的白色讲台上向群众大会讲话，讲台给聚光灯照得通亮。通向广场中心的讲台的道路两旁满饰着鲜花、棕榈叶。大盆的燃烧着的檀香发出阵阵香味。
    周恩来戴着德里市政委员会主席阿格拉瓦尔送给他的作为最高荣誉标志的金线花环。当周恩来讲话的时候，按照印度习惯盘膝坐在广场上的广大群众不断地发出热烈的掌声，并且高呼“印地秦尼巴依巴依”（印中人民是兄弟）。群众中有戴着白色的自由帽的印度教徒、包着大块头巾的魁梧的锡克人、披着美丽的沙丽并在前额上点着红色的吉祥痣的妇女。还有从附近村庄来的穿着彩色服装的农村妇女。她们乘着扎了采的牛车，唱着山歌而来。
    市政委员会主席阿格拉瓦尔在大会开始时致词欢迎周总理等。他并且献给周恩来一幅有欢迎词的红色丝织品卷轴。
    周恩来总理在会上讲了话。（全文另发）他在讲话结束的时候用印地语说：“印地秦尼巴依巴依”（印中人民是兄弟）和“加依印德”
  （印度胜利）。这些话受到成千上万群众的响应。

    群众大会最后在歌唱印地秦尼巴依巴依和中印两国国歌声中结束。
