    Changju and "The Story of Chunxiang"
    Korea An Young-il
    I have visited our brother country, great China, twice.
    Everywhere I went, I saw the powerful faces of our brothers achieving victories in socialist construction, and at the same time, I felt their warm hearts longing for world peace. I also saw art as brilliant as millions of blooming flowers. From Beijing to various cities, we came into contact with many types of operas, such as Yue opera, Peking opera, Han opera, Xi opera, and Huangmei opera. We had the opportunity to learn valuable experience in literature and art under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and we felt extremely honored. The Changju "The Story of Chunxiang" and "The Story of Shim Cheong" that we performed in China were loved and supported by the Chinese people; the bouquets the Chinese people gave us covered the entire stage, and the applause of friendship shook the entire hall; the enthusiastic embraces of cultural and artistic workers from both Korea and China, their hearts close together, this power, this emotion is unstoppable by any force.
    Changju is a national artistic heritage beloved by the Korean people.
    The history of Changju is only over fifty years. However, according to our speculation, the "ballad singing" that formed Changju has a considerable history, forming in the early eighteenth century. Ballad singing belongs to the musical category of narrative poetic drama. Ballad singing is a ballad, taking the form of solo performance, therefore without stage setting, only using drums for accompaniment. Changju developed into a new category on the basis of ballad singing music. In the early stages of Changju, even the preliminary conditions for stage art were not available, it merely moved the ballad singing script to the stage in a photographic manner. Although the lyrics of ballad singing can be said to fully possess the form of narrative poetry and dramatic elements such as unfolding contradictions and conflicts, it really only stayed at narration. Mainly because the script of Changju was moved entirely, lacking dramatic concentration, there were also many narrative parts in the lyrics. Later, there was some gradual development, but still, many forms of chorus were used to express the plot of the script, and in terms of stage setting, many used simple and symbolic images.
    Only when the Soviet army liberated Korea on "August 15th" and the people grasped political power, did Changju obtain the possibility of real development, and only then did it have a bright future. The Korean Labor Party's correct literary and artistic policy regarding the inheritance and development of national cultural heritage opened up a broad and brilliant road for the artistic development of Changju.
    On the road to the development of Changju, "The Story of Chunxiang" occupies a considerably important position.
    "The Story of Chunxiang" and "The Story of Shim Cheong" are one of the most proud and greatest heritages of the Korean nation, a true mirror of the Joseon feudal society. "The Story of Chunxiang" is one of the creations made by the Korean people's outstanding artistic talent and creative efforts.
    "The Story of Chunxiang" was created in the eighteenth century when the Joseon feudal society began to collapse. The Joseon feudal society was a typical monarchical centralism, and the emperors at that time were undoubtedly representatives of the landlord class of the ruling class, therefore the land ownership relations of the country would inevitably concentrate all the powers of centralism on the emperor, and at the same time, the parasitic bureaucratic class would inevitably appear. Therefore, it is said that the foundation on which the Joseon feudal society relied was a typical agricultural economy, and the farmers raised millions of parasitic bureaucratic classes headed by the emperor.
  But from the late eighteenth century to the early nineteenth century, the peasant movement against the aristocratic class rose higher and higher. "The Story of Chunxiang" was created against this background.
    The author of "The Story of Chunxiang" is our proud and admirable ancestor - the people. Although the Joseon feudal society was a cruel and dark society, valuable commoner literature such as "The Story of Chunxiang," "The Story of Shim Cheong," "The Story of Heungbu," and "The Story of Hong Gil-dong" also emerged. This alone is enough to illustrate the artistic talent of our ancestors. "The Story of Chunxiang," in the commoner literature of this period, occupies an important position in our national classical literature in terms of its rich content and perfect form. It penetrates deeply into the people and is universally loved and respected by the Korean people.
    The Korean people infinitely love Chunxiang and admire Yi Mong-ryong. The noble and sincere love of Chunxiang and Yi Mong-ryong, who are not afraid of Byun Hak-do's severe torture and fight for a beautiful future and for the desire for freedom, is the theme of this work. The farmers are under the clutches of feudal bureaucrats like wolves who squeeze them, but they are not desperate. No one can stop the people's yearning and desire for truth and freedom. "The Story of Chunxiang" very realistically depicts the optimism and simplicity of the farmers.
    The love between Chunxiang and Yi Mong-ryong shows the deepening of the people's hatred and anger towards the feudal ruling class, and also summarizes the people's pursuit of truth and freedom and their sincerity towards love. The people's hatred and struggle against the feudal ruling class is expressed in the following lyrics: "Golden barrels of fine wine, the blood of thousands of people; jade plates of delicacies, the fat of all surnames; when candle tears fall, the tears of the people fall; where singing is loud, resentment is high." It is precisely the theme of this work.
    I feel immensely happy to be able to serve as the director of the Changju "The Story of Chunxiang" because I feel that it is one of the important milestones in the work of inheriting and promoting national traditions.
    Applying and realizing the directing techniques of socialist realism on the Changju stage is our consistent effort.
    Realistically expressing life in specific historical circumstances is the only way to guide Changju onto the path of realism. While we are moving in the direction of creating the authenticity of life, we have also launched a merciless struggle against naturalists. Implementing the spirit of the Stanislavsky system in Changju art precisely means moving in the direction of socialist realism.
    The love of Chunxiang and Yi Mong-ryong is resistance to the feudal ruling class and a yearning for a beautiful future. Turning the narrative poem praising love, freedom, and ideals into an image on the stage is a very arduous task. We have inherited the special artistic form of Changju and boldly absorbed various characteristics of advanced stage art, and started flexible and diverse directing methods. Determining the problem of Stanislavsky's system in Changju acting is also extremely important. In music, the types of instruments compiled according to the characteristics of chorus and national musical instruments have also spent a lot of energy for the greater development of Changju art.
    Our work on national classical art is still very young and naive, this is only the first step in our exploration and sorting of the extremely valuable artistic treasures created by our ancestors.
    I am convinced that through this performance in China, we will learn a lot of valuable things, which will be of great help to our work of promoting and inheriting national heritage.

    唱剧和“春香传”
    朝鲜　安英一
    我曾经两次访问了兄弟的国家——伟大的中国。
    每到一处，我都看到了在社会主义建设中取得胜利的兄弟们的那副有力的面貌，同时我也感到他们如何地向往着世界和平的温暖的心。我也看到了犹如千万枝盛开的花朵一般灿烂的艺术，从北京到各个都市，我们曾接触过很多的剧种，如越剧、京剧、汉剧、锡剧、黄梅剧等。我们有机会学习到中国共产党所领导的文学艺术方面的宝贵的经验，感到莫大的荣幸。我们在中国访问演出的唱剧“春香传”和“沈清传”受到了中国人民的喜爱和支持；中国人民给我们的花束遮盖了整个舞台，友谊的掌声震动了整个大厅；朝、中两国的文化艺术工作者们热情的拥抱，他们的心脏互相贴在一起，这种力量，这种情感是任何力量也阻挡不住的。
    唱剧是朝鲜人民所喜爱的民族艺术遗产。
    唱剧的历史，只有五十余年。但是据我们推测，形成唱剧的“弹词”是有相当长的来历的，它在十八世纪初就已形成了。弹词是属于叙述诗剧的音乐部类，弹词是歌谣，是采取独演的形式，因此没有舞台装置，仅用鼓来伴演。唱剧是在弹词音乐的基础上发展成新的部类。唱剧的初期，就连舞台艺术的初步条件也不具备，它只是把弹词唱本照像般地搬到舞台上来。弹词的歌词，虽然可以说是充分具有叙事诗的形式和展开矛盾冲突等戏剧要素，但它的确只停留在叙述上。主要的是因为唱剧的剧本是整个搬过来的，缺乏戏剧的集中，歌词中叙述的部分也很多。后来逐渐有了一些发展，可是仍然用很多助唱的形式来表达剧本的情节，在舞台装置方面很多是用朴素而象征的形象表现出来的。
    只有苏联军队在“八·一五”解放了朝鲜、人民掌握了政权的条件下，唱剧才获得真正发展的可能，才有了光辉的前途。朝鲜劳动党关于民族文化遗产继承与发展的正确的文艺政策，给唱剧的艺术发展开辟了广阔而灿烂的道路。
    在唱剧发展的道路上，“春香传”占有相当重要的位置。
    “春香传”和“沈清传”是朝鲜民族最值得骄傲、最伟大的遗产之一，是李朝封建社会的一面真实的镜子。“春香传”是由于朝鲜人民的卓越的艺术才能，和具有创造性的努力而制成的创作之一。
    “春香传”创作于李朝封建社会开始崩溃的十八世纪。李朝封建社会，是典型的君主中央集权制，当时的帝王也就毫无疑问的是代表统治阶级的地主层了，因而国家的土地所有关系，也会必然地把一切中央集权的权力集中到帝王的身上，同时，不可避免地也就出现了寄生的官僚层。所以说李朝封建社会所依靠的基础就是典型的农业经济，农民们豢养着以帝王为首的数百万寄生的官僚层。
  可是从十八世纪末叶到十九世纪初的期间，反对贵族阶层的农民运动日益高涨起来。“春香传”就是在这样的时代背景下创作出来的。
    “春香传”的作者是我们值得骄傲钦佩的祖先——人民。李朝封建社会尽管是残酷黑暗的社会，但就像“春香传”、“沈清传”、“兴夫传”、“红吉童传”等极有价值的庶民文学也同样地产生了。仅此就足以说明我们祖先的艺术才能。“春香传”在这时期的庶民文学中，就其内容的丰富与其形式的完美来说，在我们民族古典文学中占有重要的位置。它深入民间，受到朝鲜人民普遍的喜爱和尊重。
    朝鲜人民无限地喜爱春香，敬佩李梦龙。不惧怕卞学道的严刑拷问，为了美丽的未来，为了自由的愿望而斗争的春香和李梦龙的高贵的真挚的爱，就是这作品的主题。农民处于压榨自己的像狼一样的封建官僚层魔爪下，但并不绝望。任何人也阻止不了人民对真理和自由的憧憬和愿望。“春香传”很真实地描写了农民的乐天主义和纯朴。
    春香和李梦龙之间的爱，说明了人民对封建统治阶级的憎恶和愤怒之加深，同时也总结了人民对真理和自由的企求与对爱的赤诚。人民对封建统治阶级的憎恶和斗争表现在如下的歌词中：“金樽美酒千人血，玉盘佳肴万姓膏，烛泪落时民泪落，歌声高处怨声高。”它正是这作品的主题所在。
    我能担任唱剧“春香传”导演，感到无上的喜悦，因为我感到它在继承发扬民族传统的工作中，是很重要的里程碑之一。
    把社会主义现实主义的导演手法运用和实现在唱剧舞台上，是我们始终一贯的努力方向。
    在历史的具体情况下真实地表现生活，是引导唱剧走上现实主义的唯一道路。我们在向着创造生活的真实性的方向前进的同时，也同自然主义者展开了无情的斗争。在唱剧艺术中贯彻斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的体系的精神，这正是意味着走向社会主义现实主义的方向。
    春香和李梦龙的爱情，是对封建统治阶级的抗拒，是对美好未来的憧憬，把歌颂爱情、自由、理想的叙事诗变为舞台上的形象，这是一种非常艰巨的任务。我们把唱剧的特殊艺术形式继承起来并大胆地吸取了先进舞台艺术的各种特点，开始了灵活多样的导演方法。在唱剧演技上确定斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的体系的问题，也是极其重要的。在音乐上按着合唱和民族乐器的特点而编成的乐器种类，为了唱剧艺术的更大发展，也费了很大的精力。
    我们对民族古典艺术的工作，还是非常年青和幼稚的，这仅是我们对我们祖先们所创造的极其有价值的艺术财宝进行探索、整理的第一步。
    我确信，通过这次访问中国的演出，我们学到很多而且很宝贵的东西，这对我们发扬继承民族遗产工作会有很大的帮助。
