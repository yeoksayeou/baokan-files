    Bamboo and Timber's North-South Grand Tour

    In Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and other places that produce large quantities of bamboo, basic construction departments completely use bamboo instead of wood for formwork, scaffolding, springboard supports, etc., during construction. This not only ensures timely supply due to proximity to the production area, but also saves transportation costs and reduces project costs. However, this year, bamboo-producing areas have run out of bamboo since July, and they have had to transport timber from the northeast, thousands of miles away, to replace bamboo. On the other hand, construction departments in the northeast and northwest, far from bamboo-producing areas, are transferring bamboo from the central and southern regions to replace timber. Some departments are also sending people to the production areas to purchase bamboo on their own. This has created a tight supply of bamboo and timber and a blind north-south grand tour, wasting transportation capacity and transportation costs, and increasing the "artificial tension" in transportation.

    It is hoped that relevant departments will study this issue carefully and resolve it quickly.

    竹木材南北大旅行
    出产大量竹材的湖南、江西、广东等地，基本建设部门在施工中使用的模板、脚手架、跳板支撑等，完全用竹材代替木材。这样做，不仅离产地近供应及时，而且还可以节省运输费用，降低工程造价。但是，今年竹材产地在7月以后就没有竹材用了，他们只好从相距数千里的东北运输木材来代替竹材；而远离竹材产地的东北和西北的施工部门，又从中南地区调运竹材代替木材。有些部门又私自去产地派人自行采购。这就造成竹木材的供应紧张和盲目地南北大旅行，浪费了运输力量和运输费用，增加了运输的“人为紧张”。
    希望有关部门认真研究，迅速解决这个问题。
