Answer to Readers' Questions

　　Editor's Note: Since this newspaper reported the news of "Soviet Self-Funded Travelers in China" on October 20th, some readers have written to inquire about how to travel to the Soviet Union at their own expense. Here is a brief answer:

　　In order to strengthen frequent contact between the people of China and the Soviet Union and enhance the friendship between the people of the two countries, the China International Travel Service and the Soviet International Travel Service signed a contract in January of this year, based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, to receive self-funded travelers from both sides. The contract stipulates the sale of "Comprehensive Service Travel Vouchers." Travel vouchers are divided into five grades: deluxe, superior, first-class, second-class, and third-class. There is no limit to the number of travelers in the deluxe category for each group, no less than four in the superior category, and no less than fifteen in the first, second, and third categories. The travel agency provides services according to the grade of the travel voucher.

　　Travelers holding travel vouchers can enjoy preferential treatment. Transportation costs for travelers, including train, plane, and ship fares, are paid at 50% of the current fare within the borders of the other country. They can also enjoy a one-way free ride of up to 1,000 kilometers from the first city to the second city within the tour route. The "tour route" refers to the one-way travel route between the cities selected by the traveler for sightseeing, not the entire journey from departure to return. As for the Soviet side's suggestion to reduce transportation costs by 75% of the fare, it is still being negotiated and is currently paid at 50% of the current fare. Travel vouchers are used within the tour route, including hotel accommodation, meals, car transfers, and translation guides. Once a travel voucher is purchased, these expenses do not need to be paid separately.

　　In 1956, the Soviet International Travel Service planned fifteen tour routes for self-funded travelers, each route including one or several cities, including famous cities such as Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Odessa, Kharkov, Rostov, Tbilisi, Sukhumi, Yalta, Sochi, and Stalingrad. For example, the first route is a five-day tour in Moscow: the first day is to visit famous historical sites, the second day is to visit the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition, the third day is to visit Moscow University and pay respects to the Lenin-Stalin Mausoleum, the fourth day is to visit the Kremlin, and the fifth day is to take a motorboat to tour the Moscow-Volga Canal.

　　If a traveler plans to take a train from Beijing to the Soviet Union and spend a month visiting Moscow and Leningrad, the total cost is approximately 1,000 yuan based on second class (approximately 1,500 yuan by plane), or approximately 1,400 yuan based on first class (approximately 1,600 yuan by plane).

　　Chinese citizens who wish to travel to the Soviet Union at their own expense can apply for a passport from the foreign affairs office of the provincial (municipal) people's committee in the city or nearby city where they reside, and contact the China International Travel Service Beijing Head Office or its branches in major cities to complete the procedures with their passport.

### 怎样自费去苏联旅行

　　怎样自费去苏联旅行
    编者按：自从本报10月20日报道了“苏联自费旅行者在我国”的消息以后，一些读者来信询问如何自费去苏联旅行的问题，现在简答如下：
    为了加强中苏两国人民之间的经常接触，增进中苏两国人民的友谊，今年1月中国国际旅行社同苏联国际旅行社在平等互惠的原则下签订了接待双方自费旅行者的合同。合同规定发售“综合服务旅行券”，旅行券分特等、上等、一等、二等和三等五种，每批旅行者特等不限人数，上等不得少于四人，一、二、三等不得少于十五人。旅行社按旅行券的等级进行服务。
    持有旅行券的旅行者可以享受优待。旅行者的交通费用，包括乘坐火车、飞机、轮船的费用，在对方国境以内都按照现行票价的50％支付，还可以享受游览路线以内第一个城市到第二个城市之间一千公里以内单程的免费优待。“游览路线”是指旅行者所选定的游览城市之间的单程的旅行路线，而不是指从起程到返国的全部旅程。至于苏联方面建议将交通费用按票价减少75％，因为双方还没有商妥，目前仍按现行票价50％支付。旅行券是在游览路线以内使用的。包括旅馆食宿、汽车接送、翻译导游等服务，买了旅行券，就不要再付这些费用了。
    1956年苏联国际旅行社为自费旅行者计划了十五条游览路线，每条路线有一个或几个城市，其中包括莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、明斯克、敖德萨、哈尔科夫、罗斯托夫、梯比利斯、苏呼米、雅尔达、索契、斯大林格勒等著名城市。例如：第一条路线是在莫斯科游览五天：第一天参观名胜古迹，第二天参观全苏农业展览会，第三天参观莫斯科大学和谒列宁—斯大林墓，第四天参观克里姆林宫，第五天乘汽艇游览莫斯科—伏尔加运河。
    假使一位旅行者打算坐火车从北京出发去苏联，花一个月的时间参观游览莫斯科和列宁格勒两个城市，所需的全部费用如按二等计算大约一千元（坐飞机约需一千五百元），如按一等计算约需一千四百元（坐飞机约需一千六百元）。
    凡要求自费去苏联旅行的中国公民可向所住城市或附近城市的省
  （市）人民委员会外事处申请出国护照，凭出国护照向中国国际旅行社北京总社或各大城市的分社接洽办理手续。
