Xinhua News Agency, December 6th, London Dispatch: December 3rd and 4th were bleak days for the British Parliament: Foreign Secretary Lloyd announced Britain's decision to withdraw troops from Egypt, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Macmillan reported that Britain's gold and dollar reserves had fallen to a dangerously low level. Shocked by these ominous tidings, Members of Parliament criticized the Eden government even more fiercely than before.

According to the Associated Press, this is the period when Eden's prestige is at its lowest since he took office as Prime Minister twenty months ago. Politicians from different parties are echoing the question: How many more days will Eden continue to be Prime Minister? Even some of Eden's "close friends in adversity" are asking: "How many more days?"

Not only Labor Party members have called for Eden's resignation, but even some within Eden's own party—the Conservative Party—are brewing to force Eden to step down. A United Press International dispatch said that the "Suez Group rebels" within the Conservative Party met on the evening of the 4th to decide to launch a "dump Eden" campaign. This group has already openly discussed who would be most suitable to succeed Eden. The UPI dispatch also said that a view is gaining increasing traction within the Conservative Party: to maintain the Conservative Party in power, but to replace Eden.

On the 3rd, the government submitted a motion of confidence to the House of Commons expressing support for the government. This motion required the House of Commons to express confidence in the government after two days of debate, and to adopt the government's Middle East policy as explained by Lloyd in the House of Commons. However, the Labor Party, which has consistently condemned the use of force against Egypt, proposed an amendment to the government's motion, pointing out the "devastating consequences of the government's Middle East policy," and demanding that "the unity of the Commonwealth be restored, trust between Britain and its allies be restored, and the United Nations organization be strengthened" in order to "permanently" resolve the Middle East issue. The Labor Party's amendment is considered a vote of no confidence in the government. Both proposals will be voted on the evening of the 6th.

    英国议会弥漫一片倒阁声
　　艾登政府摇摇欲坠
    新华社6日讯　伦敦消息：12月3日和4日这两天是英国议会的阴暗的日子：外交大臣劳埃德宣布英国决定从埃及撤军，财政大臣麦克米伦报告英国黄金美元储备已经下降到突破了危险点。被这些不祥消息震惊着的议员们，对艾登政府的指责，比以前更加猛烈了。
    据美联社说，现在是艾登在二十个月以前就任首相以来威信最低的时期。不同党派的政界人士都同声地发出了这样一个疑问：艾登还有多少日子继续做首相？甚至艾登的一些“患难之交”也在问：“还有多少日子？”
    不仅工党议员发出了艾登辞职的呼声，连艾登自己领导的党——保守党中也有些人在酝酿促使艾登下台。合众社的一条消息说，保守党内的“苏伊士集团反叛者”4日晚上开会决定，要展开一个“抛弃艾登”的运动。这一个集团已经公开谈到什么人来继承艾登最为合适的问题。合众社的消息还说，目前，保守党内部有一种看法正在越来越得势，这就是：继续保持保守党执政，但是撤换艾登。
    政府在3日向下院提出了一项表示支持政府的信任案，这项提案要求下院在两天的辩论后对政府表示信任，并且通过劳埃德在下院说明的政府的中东政策。但是，一直谴责对埃及动武的工党对政府的提案提出了修正，指出了“政府对中东政策的毁灭性后果”，并且要求
  “恢复英联邦的团结、恢复英国同它的盟国之间的信任，加强联合国组织”，以便“持久地”解决中东问题。工党的修正案被认为是对政府不信任的表示，这两个提案都将在6日晚上表决。
