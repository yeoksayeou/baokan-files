Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 24th: Lu Hongbin, a representative of the Shandong Provincial People's Congress and the director of the Aiguo Agricultural Cooperative in Ju County, spoke at the fifth meeting of the Shandong Provincial People's Congress on the 21st about the farmers' understanding of the superiority of agricultural cooperation. He also made an in-depth analysis of the problems of food, money, fuel, and fodder shortages existing in some agricultural cooperatives.

Lu Hongbin said, "How are the agricultural cooperatives doing after advanced cooperativization? Judging from the actual situation of our cooperative and what I have seen during my inspections, they are doing well. Many farmers say, 'Cooperativization has cut off the roots of poverty, and our confidence in taking the socialist road has become even firmer.' In the beginning, our cooperative members also reflected shortages of food, money, fuel, and fodder. Later, these problems were resolved. The veteran members of our cooperative say that cooperatives don't have three years of poverty; once you get through the difficulties, it will be fine. The road of cooperativization is big, wide, long, and glorious. You can't beat us out of it, even with a stick."

He said that the cooperatives are doing well, but there are still problems, and it is impossible to have no problems. Then he analyzed the reasons for the "four shortages" occurring in some agricultural cooperatives. He said, "Why do we say there is a food shortage? What kind of food is short? The rations of the members are generally not small, but they say it's tight for many reasons. Before cooperativization, farmers planned their planting for the next year in advance, planting whatever they needed. If a farmer's family was going to have a daughter-in-law the following year, they would plan to plant some millet and glutinous millet to prepare a plate of sticky cakes. The daughter-in-law would step on the cake to get into bed, called 'rising step by step,' to bring good luck. When a daughter was getting married, they would fry ten or twenty catties of peanuts, called 'everlasting fruit.' For weddings and funerals, every farmer's family had to prepare dozens of catties of wheat to entertain relatives and friends. From these uses, it can be seen that farmers have various needs for food. After cooperativization, when the cooperative formulated the planting plan, it did not consider this matter. Therefore, the distributed rations have certain varieties and are not easy to exchange. If there is a sudden need, there is no place to borrow. In this way, the members feel tight. In fact, the food shortage is not a new problem since cooperativization, nor is it a new problem since the implementation of unified purchase and sales. It was tight before, much tighter than now. At that time, the problem of food shortage was solved by eating chaff and wild vegetables and going hungry; no one cared about farmers without food. Now, some members say there is a food shortage, so they go to the cooperative, and everyone hears and sees it. Seeing it is right, but not analyzing it is not right."

"Money is tight. In the old society, how many farmers' families were not short of money? However, in the past, individual farmers had various ways to make money. Some people were both farmers and merchants, making money more conveniently; some people had no choice but to borrow from relatives and friends; when guests came, they bought two taels of wine, cut a few feet of cloth for making clothes, and needed two catties of cotton, which they could buy on credit from small vendors; if there was no other way, they could pawn their land and borrow at high interest rates. I was once forced to pawn my land. With these ways to make money, was money not tight? It was still tight. They owed people money and couldn't even get through the New Year. After the establishment of cooperatives, and advanced cooperativization, and after the joint state-private operation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, farmers could not do business, could not get things on credit from supply and marketing cooperatives, could not pawn their land, there were no high interest rates, and there were fewer loans from relatives and friends. Gambling and begging on the streets were even gone. In addition, the cooperative had no experience in the beginning, focusing on agricultural production and neglecting sideline production, restricting labor too much, which inevitably led to the tension of money use. However, the current tension of money is also very different from the past tension of money."

"Why is fuel tight? In the past, farmers were not short of grass, but they could find ways to solve it, mainly by cutting mountain grass, pulling bean stubble, and raking tree leaves after autumn. Now, after harvesting beans, they do winter plowing, and bean stubble cannot be pulled; mountains are closed for afforestation to conserve water and soil, and mountain grass and bark cannot be dug; more sweet potatoes are planted, and less fuel is available. The main reason for the fuel shortage is insufficient attention from the cooperative."

"As for the shortage of livestock fodder, the main reason is also poor planning and management by the cooperative. Some cooperatives have too many livestock, which is also a reason for the shortage of grass. How to solve these problems?" Lu Hongbin said that our cooperative has taken the following measures in recent years: developing production, increasing grain yield, and fundamentally solving the problem of food shortage. This year, our cooperative overfulfilled the production plan, and each person received an average of 500 catties of rations (including sweet potatoes converted into grain). Coupled with educating members to save food, no one said there was a food shortage. In order to meet the special needs of the members, the cooperative appropriately planted some millet, glutinous millet, and other small grains, and specifically solved this problem during distribution. Our cooperative also reserved a portion of mobile grain, which was used to exchange or subsidize members when they had weddings or funerals or were sick or had children, in accordance with the prescribed care methods. The way to solve the money shortage is to develop diversified economy. Our cooperative has eighteen relatively large-scale sideline businesses uniformly operated by the cooperative, and the members also have various household sideline businesses. So far, the cooperative's public sideline businesses have earned more than 65,000 yuan this year, most of which has been distributed to the members. The whole cooperative has more than 2,500 publicly and privately raised pigs, with special emphasis on raising sows. If some members do not have money to buy pigs, the cooperative lends them capital. Fuel and livestock fodder depend on the cooperative's careful planning and calculation. It is necessary to ensure that members have firewood to burn and livestock have grass to eat. This year, when we announced the annual distribution plan, we distributed 95% of the firewood to the members in a timely manner. After the summer harvest, all the publicly raised livestock in the cooperative were distributed to the members, fixed for the members to raise, manage, and feed themselves, requiring them to maintain good health, stipulating remuneration and reward methods, and allowing the members to graze in the wild. After implementing this method, a large amount of fodder has been saved for more than three months. Now there is no shortage of fodder, and the livestock are growing very strongly. In order to completely solve the difficulty of insufficient firewood, we plan to implement a grass contracting system next year as one of the contracted work and output. In this way, the firewood problem will be completely solved." Lu Hongbin finally said, "I think the cooperative is a big family, and the needs of the members are diverse. In terms of production, distribution, and management, the cooperative must not only do a good job in the collective cause, but also take care of the needs of the members. As long as we do this, the cooperative will not fail."

### 高级合作化以后农业社办得怎么样？  “合作化的道路又宽广又光荣”

    高级合作化以后农业社办得怎么样？
    “合作化的道路又宽广又光荣”
    吕鸿宾在山东省人民代表大会会议上谈农民对农业合作社优越性的体会，指出“四紧”问题是前进中的暂时的问题，是能够解决的问题，在爱国农业社是已经解决了的问题。
    新华社济南24日电　山东省人民代表大会代表、莒县爱国农业社社长吕鸿宾，21日在山东省人民代表大会第五次会议上讲述了农民心目中对于农业合作化优越性的体会，并且对目前若干农业社存在的粮、钱、烧草、饲草紧的问题作了深刻的分析。
    吕鸿宾说，农业高级合作化以后，合作社办得怎样呢？从我们社的实际情况和我视察看到的情形来说，办得还是好的。许多农民都说：“合作化了，穷根挖断了，走社会主义的信心更加坚定了。”当初，我们社社员也反映粮、钱、烧草、饲草紧，后来，这些问题都解决了。我们社的老社员们说，合作社没有三年穷日子，渡过了困难就好了。合作化的道路，又大、又宽、又长、又光荣。拿棍子打我们，也打不出去。
    他说，合作社办得好，但是还有问题，也不能没有问题。接着他分析了目前某些农业社发生“四紧”的原因。他说，为什么说粮食紧呢？什么粮食紧呢？社员们的口粮，一般并不少，他们说紧，有许多原因。合作化以前，农民种地，先打明年的谱，用什么种什么。一户农民下一年要娶儿媳妇，这一年就打谱种点黍子、稷子、预备蒸一盘粘糕，媳妇踏着糕上床，叫做“步步登高”，图个吉利。闺女要出门子，要炒十斤二十斤花生，这叫“长生果”。婚丧嫁娶，每户农民都要准备几十斤小麦，招待亲戚朋友。从这些用项，可以看出农民对粮食的需要是各种各样的。合作化了，社里拟定种植计划的时候，没有打算这件事，因此分的口粮有一定的品种，不容易掉换，临时有个急需，也没有地方借贷。这样一来，社员们就觉得紧了。其实粮食紧，既不是合作化以后紧的，也不是实行统购统销以后紧的，以前就紧，比现在紧得多。那时解决粮食紧的问题，就靠吃糠咽菜饿肚子；农民没有粮食，没有人管。现在，一部分社员说粮食紧，就找合作社，大家就都听见了，看到了。看到很对，不分析可不对。
    钱紧，在旧社会，有几家农民钱不紧呢？不过，过去个体农民进钱的门路是多种多样的。有的人又农又商，来钱方便点；有的人没有办法了，向亲朋借贷；来了客打二两酒，作衣服剪几尺布，要二斤棉花，可以向小挑上赊赊欠欠；再没有办法，可以典当土地，借高利贷。我过去就被迫着典当过土地。有这么些进钱门路，钱就不紧吗？还是紧，欠人家钱，年都没有法子过。办起合作社，又是高级合作化，以及私营工商业公私合营之后，农民不能作生意了，供销合作社里赊不出东西来了，土地也不能典当了，高利贷没有了，亲朋借贷也少了，赌钱、叫街的更没有了。加上开始办合作社没有经验，重视了农业生产，忽视了副业生产，把劳力限制得过死，这就必然发生了用钱的紧张问题。可是，现在钱的紧张，和过去钱的紧张，也是大不相同的。
    烧草为什么紧张呢？过去农民也不是不缺草，不过可以设法解决，主要是秋后割山草，拔豆楂，搂树叶等。现在，割了豆子就冬耕，豆楂不能拔了；封山造林，保持水土，不能刨山草、扒山皮了；种的地瓜（即甘薯）多了些，烧草也少了些。烧草紧的原因，主要是合作社注意不够。
    至于牲口饲草紧的问题，主要也是社里计划不周，管理不好。有些社牲口多了，也是缺草的原因。怎样解决这些问题呢？吕鸿宾说，我们社这几年来采取了以下一些办法：发展生产，粮食产量增加了，粮食紧的情况就从根本上解决了。今年，我们社超额完成了生产计划，每口人平均分到五百斤口粮（地瓜折粮在内），加上教育社员节约粮食，就没有人说粮食紧了。为了满足社员们的特殊需要，社里适当地种植了一部分黍子、稷子等小杂粮，并且在分配的时候具体地解决了这个问题。我们社里还留了一部分机动粮，用来在社员们有婚丧嫁娶或有病或生小孩的时候，按照规定的照顾办法加以掉换或补助。解决钱紧的办法，是发展多种经济。我们社有十八种较大型的由社统一经营的副业，社员还有多种家庭副业。到目前为止，今年社里公共副业挣钱六万五千多元，大部分分给了社员 。全社公私养猪二千五百多头，特别重视养母猪。有的社员没钱买猪，社里借给他们本钱。柴草和牲口饲草要靠社里计划周到和精打细算。既要使社员有柴烧，又要使牲口有草吃。今年，我们社公布全年分配方案的时候，把95％的柴草及时分给了社员。夏收以后，就把社内的公养牲口全部分给社员，固定下来叫社员自放自养自管理，提出保膘的要求，规定报酬和奖励的办法，由社员牵到野外放牧。实行这个办法以后，三个多月来节省了大批草料。现在草料不缺乏，牲口长的都很健壮。为了彻底解决柴草不足的困难，我们计划明年实行包草制度，作为包工包产的一项。这样，柴草问题就会全部解决了。吕鸿宾最后说，我觉得合作社是个大家庭，社员的需要是多种多样的。社里不论在生产、分配、管理等方面，都要既搞好集体的事业，又照顾社员的需要。只要这样办，社就没有办不好的。
