　　This newspaper reports: The six hundred and forty-seven employees of the Shenyang Cable Factory who needed housing, upon learning of the current housing shortage, voluntarily overcame temporary difficulties and withdrew their original housing applications. Some employees with relatively spacious houses even vacated a portion to give to comrades in urgent need of housing.

　　Due to a shortage of building materials, the cable factory only built dormitories capable of housing over two hundred employee households this year. However, by October 20th, the factory had already received one thousand and eleven applications for family dormitories. Some comrades, whose needs were not met, had expressed dissatisfaction with the factory leadership.

　　Recently, after employees needing housing at the factory heard the leadership's explanation regarding the housing shortage, they successively proposed to continue promoting the fine tradition of hard struggle, expressing their willingness to overcome difficulties and temporarily not request housing from the factory. Worker Tong Fengbin's house was already dilapidated, and he originally wanted to live in a new house. Now, he has borrowed a subsidy from the trade union and decided to repair the damaged house once again. Copper smelting worker Wang Taisheng built a new bunk bed in his home, solving the problem of insufficient space for his large family, and also decided not to apply for housing. To date, the number of employees applying for housing at the factory has decreased from the original one thousand and eleven to three hundred and sixty-four. Many people voluntarily withdrew their applications, willing to give the factory's newly built houses to comrades in dire need of housing.

　　Wang Yuguang, Deputy Secretary of the factory's Party Committee, and Jin Kai, Director of the copper smelting workshop, also decided to give the room jointly occupied by their two families' nannies and relatives to worker Liu Jiachun. Ma Suzhen, a worker in the electromagnetic wire workshop, and Li Bingzheng, a worker in the rolling workshop, also proposed that their houses were large and volunteered to vacate a portion to allow another comrade to move in and live together. Wang Hanbin, a shift foreman in the rolling workshop, whose house was relatively spacious, also decided to divide a room into two, inviting comrades in the workshop who urgently needed housing to move in.

　　To solve the housing problem, the factory's Party Committee held several Party Committee meetings and cadre meetings, reviewed the shortcomings of the leadership's past insufficient concern for employees' lives, and explained the reality of the housing shortage to the employees in a realistic manner. The Party Committee also instructed the Deputy Director, the Minister of the Organization Department, and the acting head of the Welfare Section to specifically lead the allocation of newly built housing. Various workshops also held continuous meetings, repeatedly explaining the situation to employees needing housing, and mobilizing everyone to give the newly built housing to comrades in dire need of housing. The machine repair workshop had a total of sixty-four employees needing housing, but according to needs and possibilities, the workshop only received eight new rooms. After the workshop leaders explained the difficulty of the housing shortage to everyone, forty-nine employees immediately volunteered not to apply for housing. The workshop's Party branch then led the remaining fifteen employees needing housing to conduct a democratic evaluation based on their needs, and as a result, ten employees obtained new housing.

　　Currently, the factory leadership is continuing to take measures to solve the problems that can be solved and the urgent housing needs of some employees.

　　沈阳电缆厂职工互助互让克服宿舍困难
　　有的人体谅当前困难自动撤销要宿舍的申请
　　有的人发扬阶级友爱腾出宽裕的房子给别人
    本报讯　沈阳电缆厂六百四十七名需要住宅的职工，听说目前住宅不足，自愿克服暂时困难，撤销了原来要房子的申请，有些房屋较宽裕的职工还腾出一部分，让给了急需房屋的同志。
    因为建筑材料不足，电缆厂今年只建筑了能容纳二百多户职工的宿舍。但是到10月20日为止，这个厂已经有一千零十一名职工申请家属宿舍，一部分同志因为没满足需要，曾一度对工厂领导方面表示不满。
    最近，这个厂需要房屋的职工听到了领导上关于住宅不足的解释后，纷纷提出继续发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，表示克服困难，暂不向工厂要住宅。工人佟凤彬的房屋已经破漏了，本想要间新房住住，现在他从工会借到了一笔补助费，决定再把坏了的房子修补一次。熔铜工人王太生在自己的家里新钉了一个吊铺，解决了人口多住不下的困难，也决定不要房屋了。到现在，这个厂申请住宅的职工已经由原来一千零十一名减少到三百六十四名，许多人自动撤销申请，愿把工厂新建的房屋让给十分急需住宅的同志居住。
    这个厂的党委副书记王玉光和熔铜车间主任金铠，也决定把两家保姆和家属共同占用的一间房屋让给工人刘家纯。电磁线车间工人马素珍、压延车间工人李秉正也提出自己房子较大，自愿腾出一部分，让另一位同志迁入，共同居住。压延车间值班工长王汉斌的房屋较宽裕，也决定把一个屋子间隔成两个，请本车间急需房子的同志迁入。
    这个厂党委为解决房屋问题，曾多次召开党委会和干部会议，检查了领导上过去对职工生活关心不够的缺点，并且向职工们说明房屋不足的实况，实事求是地加以解释。党委还责成副厂长、组织部部长、福利科代理科长等具体领导新建住宅的分配工作。各车间也连续召开了会议，反复向需房职工解释，动员大家把新建的住宅让给十分急需房屋的同志。机修车间共有六十四名职工需要房屋，但是按着需要和可能，这个车间只得到八间新房，当车间领导人员向大家解释了房屋不足的困难之后，立即有四十九名职工自动不要房屋。车间党支部又领导其余十五名需要房子的职工按需要情况进行民主评比，结果有十名职工得到了新房。
    目前，这个厂领导上正继续采取措施，解决可能解决和部分职工急需住宅的问题。
