Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, November 30th: TASS, Damascus, November 29th: Syrian Prime Minister Sabri al-Asali told reporters that Syria and other Arab countries are full of determination to defend their independence, honor, and freedom, and they will not allow anyone to invade an inch of their land.

He added that Syria and other Arab countries will never allow imperialism to re-dominate their territory. We are defending our rights, defending our lives liberated from all kinds of shackles, which is also to strengthen world peace.

Al-Asali said that from British Deputy Prime Minister Butler's remarks on the situation in Syria, it can be seen that Britain and France are still using 19th-century methods to this day, and are ignoring the opinion of the whole world and the opinions of Arab countries.

He said that the imperialist countries do not want us to live freely. They want us to be their slaves forever. But they should know that the era of imperialism ruling other nations is gone forever. In order to fight against imperialism, we have mobilized all our strength. We will defend every inch of our land.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, November 30th: Damascus dispatch: Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar said on the evening of the 29th that the government has learned that Turkish, Iraqi, and Israeli troops are currently concentrating around the Syrian border.

Bitar also said that the people of Syria, as well as their army and government, are prepared to repel any aggression.

Bitar made these remarks at a press conference. He also refuted the slander campaign launched by British, French, Israeli, and American newspapers and radio stations, as well as the newspapers of the Baghdad Pact member states, against Syria.

He refuted the fabrication that Syria has become a Soviet military base. He said that the purpose of this slander is to justify the actions of the invading countries, which are unwilling to implement the United Nations resolution on the withdrawal of foreign troops from Egyptian territory.

He added that another purpose of the invading countries' slander against Syria is to divert world opinion from the exposed anti-Syrian conspiracy, which was prepared by Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Said with the participation of Western imperialists. Nuri al-Said and his protectors attempted to strike at the Syrian army by organizing armed riots and change the current domestic regime to benefit the imperialists.

Bitar said that the last purpose of the imperialists in instigating the slander campaign against Syria is to use deception to justify the new aggression being prepared against Syria and other Arab countries.

The People's Party, which has more seats in parliament than other parties, also condemned Iraqi Prime Minister Said's conspiracy against the current Syrian regime. The People's Party spokesman and former Defense Minister Bermaida said that the party is determined to support the Syrian government in continuing to support Egypt.

On the same evening, Damascus Radio said that radio stations in London, Baghdad, Israel, Cyprus, and other places are launching a propaganda campaign to pave the way for imperialist armed intervention in Syria and other Arab countries.

　　国家的独立、荣誉和自由神圣不可侵犯
　　叙利亚总理宣布决心保卫每寸土地
　　外长揭露土、伊、以军队在叙利亚边境集结
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社大马士革29日讯：叙利亚总理萨布里·阿萨利对记者说，叙利亚和其他阿拉伯国家充满决心保卫自己的独立、荣誉和自由，它们不许任何人侵略自己的一寸土地。
    他又说，叙利亚和其他阿拉伯国家绝不容许帝国主义重新统治他们的国土。我们保卫我们的权利，保卫我们的摆脱种种枷锁而获得解放的生活，也就是为了加强世界和平。
    阿萨利说，从英国代理首相巴特勒关于叙利亚局势的谈话中可以看出，英国和法国直到今天还继续采用十九世纪的方法，并无视整个世界舆论和阿拉伯各国的意见。
    他说，帝国主义国家不愿意我们自由地生活。他们希望我们永远作他们的奴隶。但是应该让他们知道，帝国主义统治其他民族的时代已经一去不返了。为了对帝国主义进行斗争，我们动员了自己的全部力量。我们将保卫自己的每一寸土地。
    新华社30日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚外交部长比塔尔29日晚说，政府获悉，土耳其、伊拉克和以色列的军队目前正在叙利亚边境一带集结。
    比塔尔还说，叙利亚的人民以及他们的军队和政府准备反击任何侵略。
    比塔尔是在记者招待会上说这些话的。他还驳斥了英国、法国、以色列和美国的报刊和电台以及巴格达条约成员国报刊对叙利亚展开的诽谤运动。
    他驳斥所谓叙利亚已经变成苏联军事基地的捏造。他说，这种诽谤的目的是为侵略国家的行动辩解，它们不愿意执行联合国关于外国军队撤出埃及领土的决议。
    他又说，侵略国家诽谤叙利亚的另一目的就是转移世界舆论对已被揭发的反叙利亚阴谋的注意，这个阴谋是由伊拉克首相努里·赛义德在西方帝国主义者参加下准备的。努里·赛义德及其庇护者企图以组织武装暴乱的方法来打击叙利亚军队，改变目前国内政权，以利于帝国主义者。
    比塔尔说，帝国主义者煽起诽谤叙利亚的运动的最后一个目的，是想用欺骗手段来为正在准备的对叙利亚和其他阿拉伯国家的新侵略辩解。
    在议会中席次超过其他党派的人民党也谴责伊拉克首相赛义德反对叙利亚现政权的阴谋。人民党的发言人前国防部长伯尔迈达说，这个党有决心支持叙利亚政府继续支持埃及。
    同一天晚间，大马士革电台说，伦敦、巴格达、以色列、塞浦路斯等地的电台正在发动一个宣传运动，以便为帝国主义对叙利亚和其他阿拉伯国家进行武装干涉铺平道路。
