Xinhua News Agency, December 5th. The supply of non-staple foods such as pork is currently relatively tight in cities, and relevant central departments are taking measures to solve this problem.

　　The head of the Municipal Services Department said at a press conference held by the department on the 3rd that the supply of pork has been insufficient in some cities recently, vegetables are also not enough, tofu does not taste good, and brown sugar is often out of stock, and the masses continue to raise opinions. The key to this shortage of non-staple food supply is that the development of production cannot keep up with the rate of increase in people's purchasing power. For example, for live pigs, 64 million heads were produced in 1950, and 84 million heads were produced in 1956, while the sales volume increased much faster. Taking Beijing as an example, the average person ate more than 14 catties of meat in 1950, but in 1955 it increased to more than 21 catties, and this year is slightly more than last year. Brown sugar production was 240,000 tons in 1954, and is expected to increase to 900,000 tons in 1956, more than double the highest annual output before liberation, and the state also imports tens of thousands of tons of sugar from abroad every year in recent years, but it still cannot meet consumer needs.

　　When talking about the pork supply situation, the person in charge said that although the overall trend of live pig production is developing, the output in 1955 and 1956 was reduced by more than 10 million heads compared with 1954, while agriculture had a bumper harvest in 1955, and wage reform was carried out nationwide in 1956, and the purchasing power of urban and rural areas has greatly increased. In contrast, the shortage of pork is particularly prominent. He went on to analyze the reasons for the decline in live pig production: First, the increase in grain output is limited, and with the growth of urban and industrial and mining populations and the general improvement of people's living standards, the demand for grain has increased year by year; most of the rural tofu workshops, flour workshops, and oil workshops have stopped production due to centralized processing, and the grain processing industry emphasizes increasing the rice (flour) yield, reducing bran, and the source of feed for live pigs has become difficult. Second, the national commercial departments have made mistakes in the implementation of price policies, mainly reflected in the fact that the purchase price of live pigs cannot adapt to the increase in farmers' pig raising costs, and farmers have little profit in raising pigs, or even no profit. In addition, there is a general tendency to suppress grades and prices in purchases everywhere, which greatly affects farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs. Third, after the realization of agricultural cooperation last winter and this spring, the leading departments did not make clear instructions on whether pig raising should be mainly done by agricultural cooperatives or by farmers themselves. Many new problems and difficulties have also occurred in pig raising in various places, and they have not been resolved in time, which has affected the development of live pig production.

　　The head of the Municipal Services Department said that relevant central departments are taking measures to expand the source of feed for live pigs, adjust the purchase price of live pigs, promote agricultural cooperatives to strengthen the organization and leadership of pig raising, increase the number of pigs raised by state-owned farms, and prevent and control live pig diseases to develop live pig production. It is expected that by next year, especially in the second half of next year, the pork supply situation may improve.

　　When talking about the supply of non-staple foods such as vegetables and tofu, the person in charge said that the output of vegetables is sufficient except for a very few varieties, and the prices are stable. The shortcomings of the decline in vegetable quality that occurred in the previous period due to the state-owned vegetable companies adopting a contracted sales method for vegetables produced by farmers have also been largely reversed after the opening of free markets under the leadership of the state. The current problem is that there are seasonal differences in vegetable production, which makes it difficult to balance the vegetable supply. The municipal service departments should do a good job in vegetable regulation and market management to better meet consumer needs. In terms of tofu supply, in the past, many places promoted the method of making tofu with beans (bean cakes) that had been squeezed with a little oil. The tofu made did not taste good, and the masses did not like it. This practice should be corrected appropriately in the future, and at the same time, a way out should be sought from improving the technology of making tofu with bean cakes.

　　The head of the Municipal Services Department finally talked about the upcoming New Year and Spring Festival non-staple food supply issues. He said that it is difficult to fully meet the people's purchasing power requirements for non-staple food supply around these two festivals. On the one hand, the Municipal Services Department and relevant departments are working hard to organize non-staple food sources and strengthen the purchase of live pigs, so that the pork supply can be equivalent to or close to the 1955 level, and at the same time, more chickens, ducks, cattle and sheep are supplied to supplement the shortage of pork, and appropriate measures are taken to allocate more pork for the supply of urban residents; on the other hand, it is also hoped that the masses will see the current difficulties and save appropriately.

### 目前副食品供应不足的原因何在？  城市服务部负责人谈供应情况和改进措施

　　目前副食品供应不足的原因何在？
　  城市服务部负责人谈供应情况和改进措施
    新华社5日讯　目前城市中猪肉等副食品的供应情况比较紧张，中央各有关部门正在采取措施解决这个问题。
    城市服务部负责人3日在这个部举行的记者招待会上说，近来有些城市猪肉供应不足，蔬菜也感不够，豆腐不好吃，红糖时常脱销，群众不断提出意见。这些副食品供应不足的关键，在于生产的发展赶不上人民购买力提高的速度。比如生猪，1950年生产六千四百万头，1956年增加到八千四百万头，而销售量增加的速度却快得多，以北京为例，1950年平均每人吃肉十四斤多，而1955年就增加到二十一斤多，今年比去年还要稍多一些。红糖产量1954年为二十四万吨，1956年预计可增加到九十万吨，超过解放前最高年产量一倍以上，这几年国家每年还从国外进口几万吨糖，但仍然不能满足消费者需要。
    这位负责人在谈到猪肉供应情况时说，虽然生猪生产总的趋势是发展的，但1955年和1956年的产量却比1954年减产了一千多万头，而1955年农业大丰收，1956年全国进行工资改革，城乡购买力都大大提高，相形之下，猪肉的不足便特别突出。他接着分析生猪减产的原因是：第一，粮食产量提高的有限，而随着城市和工矿人口的增长和人民生活水平普遍提高，对粮食的需要量逐年增加；农村豆腐坊、粉坊、油坊因集中加工后大部分停产，粮食加工业强调提高出米（粉）率，糠麸减少，生猪的饲料来源便发生困难。第二，国家商业部门在执行价格政策上有错误，主要表现在生猪收购价格不能适应农民养猪成本增加的情况，农民养猪获利很少，甚至得不到利润，再加上各地在收购中普遍存在着压级压价的偏向，大大地影响了农民养猪的积极性。第三，去冬今春实现农业合作化以后，领导部门对养猪是以农业合作社公养为主，还是以农民私养为主，没有及时作明确的指示，各地在养猪中也发生了不少新的问题和困难，没有及时解决，影响了生猪生产的发展。
    城市服务部的负责人说，中央各有关部门正在采取扩大生猪饲料的来源，调整生猪收购价格，促使农业合作社加强对养猪的组织领导，增加国营农场的养猪数量，防治生猪疾病等办法，发展生猪生产。预计到明年，特别是明年下半年，猪肉的供应情况就可能有所好转。
    这位负责人在谈到蔬菜、豆腐等副食品的供应情况时说，蔬菜除极少数品种外，产量是足够的，价格是稳定的，前一时期因国营蔬菜公司对农民生产的蔬菜采取包销办法而发生的蔬菜质量下降的缺点，在开放国家领导下的自由市场后，也已大体扭转。目前的问题是因为蔬菜生产存在着季节差别，不容易使蔬菜供应做到平衡，城市服务部门应当做好蔬菜调剂和市场管理工作，更好地满足消费者需要。豆腐的供应方面，过去很多地方推行用榨过少许油的豆子（豆饼）做豆腐的方法，做出的豆腐味道不美，群众不喜爱，今后应该适当纠正这种做法，同时也要从改进豆饼做豆腐的技术上寻求出路。
    城市服务部的负责人最后谈到了即将到来的新年和春节期间的副食品供应问题。他说，这两个节日前后，副食品的供应要完全满足人民购买力的要求是有困难的。城市服务部和有关部门一方面努力组织副食品货源，加强生猪收购工作，使猪肉的供应量能相当或接近于1955年的水平，同时多供应鸡鸭和牛羊，以补猪肉的不足，并且采取适当措施多调剂一些猪肉出来供应城市市民；另一方面，也希望群众看到目前的困难，适当地进行节约。
