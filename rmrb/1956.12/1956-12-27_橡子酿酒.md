    Acorn Wine Making
    Acorns, also known as "qing gang zi," are the fruits of the *Quercus variabilis* tree. They contain about 30% starch, as well as small amounts of reducing sugars and tannins, and can be used as raw materials for winemaking. According to tests by the Shaoyang and Zhuzhou distilleries under the Hunan Provincial Monopoly Company, each 100 *jin* of acorn meat can produce an average of about 45 *jin* of 40-proof *baijiu* (white liquor). The quality of the wine is not much different from *baijiu* made from rice. The distiller's grains left over from acorn winemaking, when sealed with mud for two weeks and then applied to paddy fields, can loosen the soil. The fertility is similar to that of "three-in-one fertilizer" (human, cattle, and pig manure), and is even better than refined nitrogen fertilizer. The tannins contained in acorns can be refined into tannin glue to meet the needs of the leather industry.
    Hunan Province produces about 200,000 *dan* of acorns annually. In the past, only a small portion was collected by some farmers for making tofu and as livestock feed. The vast majority was left to rot on the ground. Now, utilizing them for winemaking can not only increase farmers' income but also save more than 7 million *jin* of grain per year. (Shi Moyu)

    橡子酿酒
    橡子，又名青杠子，是青杠树所结果实，含淀粉30％左右，并含有少量还原糖和单宁等有机成分，可作酿酒原料。据湖南省专卖公司所属邵阳、株州等地酒厂试验的结果，每百斤橡子肉，平均可产四十度白酒四十五斤左右，酒的质量同稻谷原料所酿白酒没有多大差别。橡子酿酒后的丢糟，用稀泥封闭两周后下稻田，能使泥土疏松，肥力与三合肥（人、牛、猪粪）相似，较细氮肥还好。橡子中所含的单宁可以炼为单宁胶，满足制革工业的需要。
    湖南省每年产橡子约二十万担。过去仅有部分农民采集极少部分作豆腐原料及牲畜饲料，绝大部分都任它掉在地上霉烂，现在利用它来酿酒，不仅可以增加农民的收入，一年内还可节约粮食七百多万斤。　（石磨玉）
