Xinhua News Agency, December 6th, Paris dispatch: Over the issues of Algeria and the Middle East, the Mollet government is currently under attack from both left-wing figures within the governing coalition and right-wing figures who have consistently supported the government.

The Radical Socialist Party, one of the mainstays of Mollet's "Republican Front" government, is intensifying its attacks on Mollet. The party's Paris City Committee passed a resolution on the 4th, demanding that Mollet "completely change his policy" on the Algerian issue and immediately replace Resident Minister in Algeria, Lacoste, otherwise, it will demand that the eleven Radical Socialist ministers and undersecretaries participating in the cabinet resign.

The Paris City Committee of the Radical Socialist Party also passed a motion by an overwhelming majority, demanding that the "Republican Front" alliance (including the Socialist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, the Social Republican Party, and the Democratic Social Resistance Union) form a new cabinet.

Left-wing socialists, dissatisfied with Mollet's military line in Algeria, are also openly "rebelling" against Mollet. On the 5th, seventeen Socialist parliamentarians (the total number of Socialist parliamentarians is one hundred) and four Socialist parliamentarians from the French Federation Council jointly wrote to the Socialist Party leadership, criticizing the Mollet government for adopting a "reactionary" policy in Algeria and taking "disastrous actions" in Egypt. These parliamentarians include Socialist leaders such as Mox, the French Permanent Representative to the United Nations Disarmament Commission, and Meyer, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Assembly. This action is considered a "serious offensive" launched by a "powerful minority" within the Socialist Party against the Mollet government.

In view of this situation, the French Socialist Party has decided to convene an emergency meeting of the National Committee in Paris on December 14th.

In order to ease the fierce opposition from the Radical Socialist Party and within the Socialist Party, the Mollet government decided on the 5th to carry out some "political reforms" in Algeria. It plans to dissolve the European-controlled municipal councils there and replace them with a special delegation, with Europeans and Arabs each accounting for half.

Although this plan is still in the drafting stage, it has already made the so-called centrist and right-wing parties in the National Assembly, which demand a "tough" policy, uneasy. They are concerned that the government is making too many "concessions" politically. On the same day that the Mollet government decided to carry out "reforms" in Algeria, the Senate (Upper House) of the Republic, in which these parties hold a majority of seats, passed a resolution demanding that the government "take the necessary steps to prevent Tunisia, Morocco, and any other foreign country from helping the Algerian riots." Although the resolution also advocated "stopping the bloodshed in Algeria," it also emphasized the so-called "not harming France's sovereignty."

Xinhua News Agency, December 7th, TASS Paris dispatch, December 5th: The leader of the French "Independent Republican Party," former Prime Minister Paul Reynaud, complained bitterly about the failure of the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt. He published an article in the "Paris Review," expressing indignation that the British and French governments had failed to achieve their predetermined goals of seizing the Suez Canal and overthrowing the current Egyptian government. According to him, the British and French troops should have "marched into Cairo." He criticized the French government's actions as "not forceful enough."

　  在埃及和阿尔及利亚的军事冒险挫败
　　摩勒政府出现危机
    政府联盟内部左右派发动夹攻
    新华社6日讯　巴黎消息：在阿尔及利亚和中东问题上，目前摩勒政府正在受到政府联盟内部的左派人士和一向支持政府的右派人士的双重攻击。
    作为摩勒“共和阵线”政府主要台柱之一的激进社会党，正在加强它对摩勒的攻击。这个党的巴黎市委员会已经在4日通过了一项决议，要求摩勒在阿尔及利亚问题上“完全改变他的政策”，并且立即撤换阿尔及利亚驻节部长拉戈斯特，否则，它将要求参加内阁的十一个激进社会党的部长和次长辞职。
    激进社会党巴黎市委员会还以压倒多数票通过了一项动议，要求由“共和阵线”联盟（包括社会党、激进社会党、社会共和党和民主社会抵抗联盟）另组新阁。
    不满摩勒在阿尔及利亚采取军事路线的左翼社会党人，也对摩勒公开“反叛”。5日，有十七个社会党议员（社会党议员总数是一百人）和四个法兰西联邦议会社会党议员联名写信给社会党领导机构，批评摩勒政府在阿尔及利亚采取
  “反动”政策并且在埃及采取“灾难性的行动”。这些议员中包括像法国常驻联合国裁军委员会代表莫克和法国国民议会外交委员会主席麦耶这样一些社会党领袖。这个行动被认为是社会党内部“强有力的少数派”对摩勒政府发动的一个“严重攻势”。
    鉴于这种形势，法国社会党已经决定在12月14日在巴黎召开全国委员会紧急会议。
    为了缓和来自激进社会党和社会党内部的激烈反对，摩勒政府在5日决定要在阿尔及利亚进行一些“政治改革”。它计划解散那里的由欧洲人控制的市议会，而代之以一种特别代表团，其中欧洲人和阿拉伯人各半。
    虽然这个计划还在草拟阶段，但是，它已经使得国民议会中要求采取“强硬”政策的所谓中间派和右翼党派感到不安。他们耽心政府在政治上“让步”太多。就在摩勒政府决定要在阿尔及利亚进行“改革”的同一天，这些党派拥有多数议席的共和国参议院（上院）通过了一个决议，要求政府“采取必要的步骤，使得突尼斯、摩洛哥和其他任何外国不能再帮助阿尔及利亚的暴乱”。决议虽然也主张“停止阿尔及利亚的流血”，但是同时又强调所谓“要不妨害法国的主权”。
    据新华社7日讯　塔斯社巴黎5日讯：法国“独立共和党”领袖、前总理保罗—雷诺对英法侵略埃及遭到失败非常抱怨。他在“巴黎评论”发表文章，对英法两国政府没有达到夺取苏伊士运河和推翻埃及现政府的预定目的表示愤慨。按照他的说法，英法军队应该“开进开罗”。他批评法国政府的行动“不够有力”。
