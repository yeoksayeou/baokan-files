Xinhua News Agency, December 28th - Recently, the National Bureau of Statistics has streamlined the statistical reporting forms it issues, so that the statistical workload of major reports on industrial and agricultural production, capital construction, and material and technical supply can be reduced by more than 60% compared to the past. This will not harm the work.

In this streamlining of reporting forms, the National Bureau of Statistics has completely abolished all original monthly mailing reports, and converted some of the monthly reports into quarterly or semi-annual reports, greatly reducing the number of reports and the statistical workload.

In terms of the issuance of report forms, the past practice of uniformly formulating grassroots report forms and sending them directly to grassroots enterprises or institutions for completion has also been changed. In the future, only comprehensive requirement forms will be issued to various departments and provinces and cities, and then they will formulate grassroots report forms according to the specific conditions of their departments and regions, so as to combine the requirements of all parties and avoid duplication and waste.

After streamlining, the scope of regular statistical reports has been reduced. For example, the number of industrial enterprises observed quarterly in the past was more than 100,000, but now it has been reduced by about three-quarters, greatly reducing the workload, but it is still possible to grasp the basic situation of the main enterprises, which account for more than 90% of the total output value of all industrial enterprises, on schedule. The indicators and classification catalogs of statistical reports have also been streamlined. For example, the three sets of regular comprehensive reports for large-scale industry, agriculture, and material and technical supply had a total of 427 indicators in the past. After streamlining, only 190 basic indicators are retained, and the remaining indicators are prepared to obtain the necessary data by other simple methods.

The National Bureau of Statistics' streamlining of statistical reports was carried out in the second half of the year during the study of the documents of the Party's "Eighth National Congress" and the examination of bureaucracy and subjectivism. This work has not yet been completed. At present, there are still a small number of report forms that have not been streamlined, and they are being jointly studied with relevant departments for streamlining.

    克服官僚主义和主观主义的措施之一
    国家统计局减少报表
    各种主要报表统计工作量减少60％，对工作并无妨害
    据新华社28日讯　最近，国家统计局对制发的统计报表做了精简，使工、农业生产，基本建设和物资技术供应等方面的主要报表的统计工作量，约可较过去减少60％以上。
    国家统计局这次精简报表，全部取消了原有的各种邮寄月报表，把其中一部分月报改为季报或半年报，使报告次数和统计工作量大为减少。
    在报表的颁发方式上，也改变了过去统一制定基层报表，一直发到基层企业或事业单位填报的做法。今后，只向各部门、各省市制发综合要求表，然后再由他们根据本部门、本地区的具体情况制定基层报表，以便把各方面的要求结合起来，避免重复浪费现象。
    经过精简后的定期统计报表，缩小了实施范围。例如，过去按季观察的工业企业单位数，达十多万个，现在较过去减少四分之三左右，工作量大大减少，但仍能按期掌握占全部工业企业总产值90％以上的主要企业的基本情况。统计报表的指标和分类目录也作了精简。如过去大型工业、农业和物资技术供应三套定期综合报表共有四百二十七个指标，精简以后，只保留一百九十个基本指标，其余指标准备用其他简便办法来取得必要的资料。
    国家统计局这次精简统计报表，是在下半年学习党的“八大”文件，检查官僚主义、主观主义过程中进行的。这一工作还未结束。目前还有一小部分报表没有精简，正同有关部门共同研究精简中。
