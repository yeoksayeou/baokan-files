Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 20th: Zhang Tixue, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of Hubei Province, said at a meeting of cadres of directly subordinate organizations in the province on the 19th that the provincial and prefectural-level organs in Hubei Province will streamline an average of 20% to 30% of their personnel to strengthen the lower levels, and administrative expenses will be reduced by 50%.

At the meeting, Zhang Tixue first exposed and criticized the phenomena of large institutions, overlapping levels, and overstaffing in some organs, as well as the hedonistic thinking of some cadres who emphasize extravagance, compare clothing and food, and demand better treatment. He said that many organs, enterprises, and institutions in Hubei Province have not yet developed, but they "buy the saddle before the horse," spending a lot of money, while cadres have nothing to do. There are too many internal publications in the organs, and all matters, large and small, require official documents. Many organs compare wealth, emphasize extravagance, and purchase too many or too good furniture. Many enterprises and institutions have suffered significant losses due to poor storage, causing commodities to deteriorate and grain to mold. He also pointed out that bourgeois ideology is currently raising its head among some of our cadres, and we must strengthen education in communist morality and cultivate the spirit of hard struggle for building socialism.

Zhang Tixue said that the provincial Party committee's requirement for all levels of organs in the future is to spend less money and do more work, and to do things well. Zhang Tixue also proposed eight specific saving measures, including streamlining organ cadres, streamlining meetings and documents, and rationally adjusting housing.

In his report, Zhang Tixue pointed out that in Hubei Province's campaign for increasing production and practicing economy, leadership must be strengthened, comprehensive inspections must be carried out, and deviations must be prevented. Education on combining production development with improvement of living standards must be conducted among the vast number of workers, as well as education on cherishing state property and practicing thrift and frugality. The entire Party and all cadres must be educated to establish the excellent style of hard work and simplicity, building the country with diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift.

    改变层次重叠人浮于事的状况
    湖北将精简机构充实下层
    新华社武汉20日电　中共湖北省委书记处书记、湖北省省长张体学19日在省直属机关干部大会上说，湖北省省级及专署级机关今后平均要精简20％到30％的人员充实下层，行政经费要削减50％。
    张体学在会上首先揭发并批判了某些机关机构庞大、层次重叠，人浮于事的现象，以及干部中讲排场、比吃穿、闹待遇的享乐思想。他说，湖北省的不少机关、企业事业还没发展起来，便“先买鞍，后买马”，花掉不少经费，而干部无事可干；机关刊物过多，大小事都要行文；不少机关比阔气、讲铺张、购买家具过多过好；不少企业单位，由于保管不善，使商品变质、粮食霉烂而造成重大损失。他并且指出：资产阶级思想目前在我们某些干部中有所抬头，今后必须加强共产主义道德品质的教育，加强为建设社会主义而艰苦奋斗的教育。
    张体学说，省委对各级机关今后的要求是要少花钱多办事，而且要把事办好。张体学还提出了精简机关干部、精简会议和文件、合理调整房子等八项具体节约措施。
    张体学在报告中指出，湖北省在增产节约中，要加强领导，全面检查，防止偏差。要对广大职工进行发展生产和改善生活相结合的教育，进行爱护国家财产和省吃俭用、勤俭持家的教育。要教育全党和全体干部树立艰苦朴素、勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业的优良作风。
