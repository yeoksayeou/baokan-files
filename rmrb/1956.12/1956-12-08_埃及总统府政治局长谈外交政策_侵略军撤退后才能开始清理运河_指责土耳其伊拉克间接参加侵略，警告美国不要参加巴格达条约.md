    Cairo, December 7 (Xinhua News Agency) - Ali Sabri, Director of the Political Bureau of the Egyptian Presidential Office, spoke to a United Press reporter on December 6 about Egypt's policy after the Anglo-French announcement of troop withdrawal. He said: "Egypt is concerned about the clearing of the canal. This is not only a problem affecting Britain and France, but also a problem affecting other countries friendly to Egypt. In order to show our goodwill and concern, we have decided to allow surveys to be carried out simultaneously with the troop withdrawal, but the actual work of clearing the canal can only begin after the troops have actually withdrawn."
    He added, "We agree to guarantee navigation of the canal. But the immediate problem is: the aggressors are still on our territory. Our attitude towards the issue of freedom of navigation in the canal has always been the same and will not change in the future. As I said, this is not only a problem for Britain and France, but also for other countries friendly to Egypt."
    When asked whether Egypt would be willing to participate in future canal negotiations with Britain and France, Sabri said, "I cannot provide a definite answer. But I personally believe that Britain and France cannot participate. Their aggression against Egypt means that they are no longer willing to participate in negotiations. I think that since they have refused to participate, they can no longer participate."
    Regarding Egypt's future relations with Britain and France, he said: "I don't think it is possible to re-establish diplomatic relations quickly. But, I cannot say that no diplomatic relations will be established in the future." He said that the return of departing British and French expatriates "must be approved by the Egyptian government. This depends on each individual case."
    Regarding the Israeli claim to place part of the Sinai Peninsula under United Nations control, he said, "We will not agree to anything that undermines our sovereignty. Israel is not qualified to set conditions. If Israel thinks it must establish a buffer zone, then why doesn't it establish it within Israeli territory? We believe that we do not need anyone's protection."
    Sabri accused the Baghdad Pact countries Turkey and Iraq of "indirectly" participating in the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt. He said: "I think the Baghdad Pact has become a psychological thing in the minds of the people of this region, an evil rather than a good. If the United States joins, it will be associated with that evil."
    He said: "We found some ships in the invading fleet, mainly French aircraft carriers, hiding in Turkish waters. Therefore, a Baghdad Pact country indirectly participated in the aggression."
    "Iraqi air bases were also used to refuel planes evacuating the wounded. Hospitals were also used. Certainly, one air base there was used. This is also indirect participation in the aggression."
    "It is said that the purpose of this treaty is to deal with possible communist aggression. But if the first action of this treaty is to participate in an aggression with the British, I don't think you should blame people for seeing it as an aggressive treaty against the people of this region."
    Sabri made these remarks in response to the question of whether the United States joining the Baghdad Pact would make the treaty acceptable to Egypt.

    埃及总统府政治局长谈外交政策
　　侵略军撤退后才能开始清理运河
　  指责土耳其伊拉克间接参加侵略，警告美国不要参加巴格达条约
    据新华社7日讯　开罗消息：埃及总统府政治局局长阿里·萨布里12月6日向合众社记者谈英法宣布撤军以后埃及的政策。他说：“埃及关心运河的清理工作，这不仅是一个影响英法的问题，它也是一个影响与埃及友好的其他国家的问题。我们为了表示我们的善意和关心起见，已经决定同意让勘察与撤军同时进行，但是清理运河的实际工作只有在军队确实已经撤退以后才能开始。”
    他又说，“我们同意保证运河的航行。但是眼前的问题是：侵略者仍旧在我国的领土上。我国对运河航行自由问题的态度一向是不变的，今后也不会改变。正如我所说的，这不仅是英法的问题，也是与埃及友好的其他国家的问题。”
    合众社记者问到埃及是否愿意同英法一道参加今后的运河谈判。萨布里说，“我不能提供一个明确的答复。但是我个人认为英法不可以参加。它们对埃及的侵略就意味着它们已经不愿意参加谈判了。我想，它们既然已经拒绝参加了，它们就不能再参加了。”
    谈到埃及将来同英法的关系的时候，萨布里说：“我认为，不可能很快就重新建立外交关系。但是，我不能说，将来不会建立任何外交关系。”他说，离境的英法侨民重新回来“须经埃及政府批准。这要看每一个个别情况。”
    关于以色列方面主张把西奈半岛的一部分置于联合国的控制之下的说法，他说，“我们将不同意任何有损我们的主权的事情，以色列没有资格提出条件。如果以色列认为它必须建立一个缓冲区，那么它为什么不在以色列境内建立呢？我们认为，我们不需要任何人的保护。”
    萨布里指责巴格达条约国家土耳其和伊拉克“间接”参加了英法对埃及的侵略。他说：“我认为巴格达条约在这个地区人民的心目中已经成为一个心理上的东西，是恶而不是善。如果美国加入的话，它将和那个罪恶联系起来。”
    他说：“我们发现有些入侵舰队的舰只，主要是法国的航空母舰，藏在土耳其的海面上。因此一个巴格达条约国家就间接地参加了侵略。
      “伊拉克的空军基地也被用来为撤退伤员的飞机加油。医院也被使用过。肯定地在那里有一个空军基地是被利用过的。这也是间接参加侵略。
      “据说这个条约的目的是对付可能的共产党侵略的。可是如果这个条约的第一个行动是和英国人一起参与一个侵略，我想你就不应当责怪人们把它看作是对付这个地区人民的一个侵略性条约”。
    萨布里这些话是回答关于美国加入巴格达条约是否会使埃及能接受这个条约的问题的。
