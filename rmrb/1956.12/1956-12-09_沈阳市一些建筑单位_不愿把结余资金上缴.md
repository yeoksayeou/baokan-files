Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 7th: More than eighty construction units in Shenyang have a total surplus of over ten million yuan after completing this year's construction tasks.

　　However, some units are not handing over these valuable construction funds to the state and are instead keeping them for unauthorized use.

　　The Shenyang Railway Administration planned to use the surplus of over 4.5 million yuan from railway construction for non-production expenditures. After being stopped by the Municipal Basic Construction Bank, they still did not want to hand over 190,000 yuan. The Municipal Real Estate Administration used surplus basic construction funds to buy four water pumps they did not need at all, planning to store them until next year to exchange for other materials. The Shenyang Food Industry School used 600 yuan of surplus basic construction funds to buy an imported radio. The Municipal Sports Commission spent 530 yuan more than the budget approved by higher authorities to buy two sets of leather and velvet sofas.

　　If the above-mentioned phenomena are not corrected quickly, they will waste state funds. It is hoped that relevant departments will pay attention.

　　沈阳市一些建筑单位
　　不愿把结余资金上缴
    据新华社沈阳7日电　沈阳市八十多个建设单位完成今年建设任务以后，一共结余资金一千多万元。
    但是有些单位不把这些宝贵的建设资金缴给国家，竟私自留下乱用。
    沈阳铁路管理局打算把修建铁路结余的四百五十多万元资金用作非生产开支，经市基本建设银行制止以后，仍然有十九万元不想上缴；市房地产管理局用结余的基本建设资金，买了四台他们根本用不着的水泵，准备存到明年换别的物资；沈阳食品工业学校用结余的基本建设资金六百元买了一台进口收音机；市体育运动委员会比上级批准的预算多花了五百三十元去买了两套皮、绒沙发。
    上述种种现象如不迅速纠正，将会浪费国家资金，希有关部门注意。
