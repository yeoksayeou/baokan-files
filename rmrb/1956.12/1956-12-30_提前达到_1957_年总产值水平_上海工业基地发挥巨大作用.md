Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 29th. Shanghai, China's coastal industrial base, has reached the 1957 total industrial output level stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan one year and three months ahead of schedule. The city's total industrial output plan for this year was also overfulfilled by 2% at the end of November. It is estimated that by the end of the year, the city's industrial output value can exceed the annual plan by 10.4%. This figure represents an increase of 31.1% over last year and more than two and a half times that of 1949.

This year, Shanghai supplied the Luoyang First Tractor Factory with more than 100 various precision grinders. The 360-kilowatt generators produced by the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant have been installed in Lhasa and Shigatse in Tibet. The 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generators produced in Shanghai supported the new power station in Xinjiang. In the primeval forests of Northeast China, electric motors and generators produced in Shanghai are the power for logging. This year, Shanghai also supplied coastal fishermen with more than 100 marine diesel engines.

Shanghai, China's largest textile industrial center, supplied a total of more than 1.79 billion meters of cotton cloth to the country and for export this year, exceeding the total supply in 1952, the year before the First Five-Year Plan, by more than 60%, reaching the highest peak since liberation. The vast majority of these were sold domestically, enough for each of the 600 million people in the country to make a new piece of clothing.

Shanghai's light industry, with its wide variety and large output, also produced a large number of products this year. The production of rubber shoes alone reached more than 53 million pairs this year, meaning that on average, about two households out of China's 120 million farming households could buy a pair.

Shanghai successfully trial-produced more than 6,000 new products this year. The new products in heavy industry are mostly machines and equipment with relatively high technical requirements, while the new products in light industry are mostly high-end products. China's major new products in the machinery industry, the 12,000-kilowatt steam turbine and steam turbine generator, have been successfully trial-produced by the Shanghai Steam Turbine Plant and the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant, respectively. The Shanghai Machine Tool Plant has trial-produced three more types of grinders than the 22 types stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan. The majority of these 25 types are precision grinders used in China's emerging automobile, tractor, and aircraft industries.

New products such as new drugs that are very effective in treating tuberculosis, oral penicillin, fundus cameras for photographing the internal structure of the eye, lightweight and beautiful rubber-soled sandals, women's umbrellas that can be folded up and placed in a handbag, hard-toed work boots for miners, and stew pots, ghee churns, and pilaf dishes for ethnic minorities have all been trial-produced. This year, the patterns of enamelware have been greatly renovated, with a total of more than 800 new patterns added.

    提前达到1957年总产值水平
    上海工业基地发挥巨大作用
    今年上海工业部门一共试制成功了六千多种新产品，上海制造的机器设备装备了全国许多个新企业，上海出产的销售国内的棉布可供全国人民每人做一件新衣服。
    新华社上海29日电　我国沿海的工业基地——上海，已经提前一年零三个月达到第一个五年计划所规定的1957年工业总产值水平；全市工业今年的总产值计划，也在11月底超额2％完成。预计到年底，全市工业产值可以比今年年度计划超额10.4％。这个数字比去年增长了31.1％，比1949年增长两倍半以上。
    今年，上海供应给洛阳第一拖拉机制造厂的各种精密磨床就有一百多台。上海电机厂生产的三百六十瓩发电机，已经在西藏拉萨和日喀则安装。上海生产的六千瓩汽轮发电机，支援了新疆的新电站。在东北的原始森林里，上海生产的电动机和发电机是开伐木材的动力。今年上海还供应沿海渔民一百多台船用柴油机。
    上海这个我国最大的纺织工业中心，今年供应全国和出口的棉布共计有十七亿九千多万公尺，超过第一个五年计划的前一年——1952年供应总数的60％以上，达到了解放以来的最高峰。其中绝大部分是销售国内各地的，可供全国六亿人每人做一件新衣服。
    品种多产量大的上海轻工业行业，今年也生产了大量产品，单是今年生产的胶鞋就有五千三百多万双，我国一亿二千万农户中，平均约两户人家就可以买到一双。
    上海今年试制成功的新产品共有六千多种。重工业新产品多是技术要求比较高的机器设备，轻工业新产品大都是高级产品。我国机械工业的重大新产品——一万二千瓩的汽轮机和汽轮发电机，都已经在上海汽轮机厂和上海电机厂分别试制成功。上海机床厂已经比第一个五年计划规定试制的二十二种磨床多试制出了三种，这二十五种大部分是我国新兴的汽车、拖拉机和飞机工业应用的精密磨床。
    治疗肺结核很有效的新药、口服用的青霉素，拍摄眼睛内部结构的眼底摄影机、轻巧美观的胶底凉鞋，可以折叠起来放在手提包里的女用伞，矿工穿的硬头工作靴、少数民族用的焖锅、酥油壶和抓饭盘等等新产品，都已经试制出来。今年搪瓷用品的花色大翻新，一共增加了八百多种新花样。
