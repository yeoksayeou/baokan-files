Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 30th - According to a Vientiane radio broadcast today, Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of the Lao Kingdom Government, and Prince Souphanouvong, representative of the Lao Fighting Units, said in a joint communiqué signed on the 29th that they had unanimously decided to expand the current Kingdom Government and establish a coalition government before holding supplementary general elections, in order to realize the principle of both sides starting to establish a unified country and promoting the resolution of other issues.

The Lao Fighting Units representatives should have a considerable position in this government to represent national unity on the basis of a suitable political program, to jointly build a peaceful, democratic, unified, independent, and prosperous Laos. The coalition government must obtain the trust of the National Assembly in accordance with the constitution.

After the establishment of the coalition government, the Lao Fighting Units will become a political organization called the "Lao Patriotic Front," engaging in legal activities like other political parties.

Regarding the two provinces issue, the two princes decided that after the establishment of the coalition government, the administration and military of the two provinces (referring to Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces - editor's note) will belong to the administration of the coalition government and will be reorganized according to the form of the Kingdom side.

In order to solve this problem, the coalition government will authorize the Joint Political and Military Committee to consult in the spirit of the joint communiqués of August 5 and 10, 1956.

Prince Souphanouvong arrived in Vientiane on November 7. He exchanged views with Prince Phouma on the major principles related to fully resolving the Lao issue in accordance with the Geneva Accords, as stipulated in the two joint communiqués signed by the Lao Kingdom Government and the Lao Fighting Units on August 5 and 10, 1956.

The joint communiqué of the 29th said that the two princes unanimously believed that the atmosphere of intimacy and mutual understanding between the two sides had developed more than before, and felt that the Joint Political and Military Committee had achieved good results from the preliminary stage of the meetings held since September 26 in order to seek practical measures to implement the above-mentioned two statements, such as the successive signing of agreements on the cessation of hostilities, agreements on a policy of peaceful neutrality, and agreements guaranteeing the rights of Lao citizens.

The two princes unanimously believed that it is necessary to widely publicize and convey the signed agreements in order to respond to the expectations of the people of the whole country.

The two princes unanimously believed that the two delegations of the Joint Political and Military Committee had conducted detailed discussions on unresolved issues, such as: guaranteeing the democratic rights and freedoms of the people, restoring the freedom of political prisoners, supplementary general elections, and resolving the administration and military issues of the two provinces. The opinions of both sides are also close to being consistent, so the delegations of both sides should make mutual efforts to be tolerant in order to reach an agreement more quickly and better.

Regarding the issue of conducting supplementary general elections throughout the country, the two princes agreed that in the election law to be drafted by the National Assembly, the right to vote and be elected for all male and female citizens must be guaranteed in accordance with the principles of secret ballot and direct, free, and equal elections. At the same time, measures must be taken to ensure the fairness of the election and to prevent fraud, so as to be in line with the spirit of the Kingdom's Constitution.

The joint communiqué finally stated that in order to enable both sides to resolve issues reasonably and smoothly in accordance with the wishes of the people of the whole country, the two princes decided to meet again when necessary.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 30th - Vientiane news: The political delegations of the Lao Kingdom Government and the Lao Fighting Units have reached a concrete agreement on measures to ensure that the Lao Fighting Units and former resistance personnel enjoy civil rights and participate in the administration of the Kingdom at all levels.

The delegations of both sides held more than 40 days of meetings in Vientiane from November 6 to December 23 to negotiate these specific measures.

The agreement signed on December 24 stipulates that the "Lao Patriotic Front" and other political organizations such as youth and women have the right to carry out activities throughout the country, establish offices, set up branches, and publish publications, etc., and the Kingdom Government guarantees to provide convenience.

The Lao Fighting Units, people related to the Lao Fighting Units, and former resistance personnel all enjoy the democratic freedoms of citizens. The Kingdom Government prohibits taking discriminatory, discriminatory, retaliatory measures against them and infringing on their democratic freedoms, and violators will be prosecuted by the court.

Lao cadres and former resistance personnel can participate in the work of the Kingdom's governments at all levels and various professional departments. The number of years they participated in the War of Resistance will be regarded as the number of years of service to the Kingdom, and the original level of treatment will remain unchanged. Diplomas and certificates issued by Laos shall be regarded as having the same effect as those issued by the Kingdom. Certificates of merit issued by Laos should all be retained as awards for the recipients' contributions to Laos under the Kingdom's regime.

The Joint Political Committee of both sides will establish a joint team responsible for arranging the work and rank of Lao cadres and former resistance personnel. The Kingdom Government will allocate their work and determine their rank in accordance with the decisions of the Joint Political Committee.

    共同建设和平民主统一独立和繁荣的国家
    老挝双方决定成立联合政府
    寮国战斗部队改成“老挝爱国战线”，两省的政权和军队将属于联合政府
    新华社河内30日电　据万象电台今天广播，老挝王国政府首相梭发那·富马亲王和寮国战斗部队代表苏发努冯亲王在29日签订的联合公报说，他们已经一致决定扩大现在的王国政府，在举行补充普选之前成立联合政府，以实现双方着手建立统一国家和促进解决其他各项问题的原则。
    寮国战斗部队代表在这个政府中应有相当的地位，以表示在一个适合的政治纲领的基础上的民族团结，来共同建设一个和平、民主、统一、独立和繁荣的老挝。联合政府要按照宪法得到国会的信任。
    联合政府成立后，寮国战斗部队将成为一个称为“老挝爱国战线”的政治组织，同其他政党一样的合法活动。
    关于两省问题，两位亲王决定，联合政府成立之后，两省（指桑怒和丰沙里两省——编者注）的政权和军队将属于联合政府的管理之下，按照王国方面形式重新加以组织。
    为了解决这一问题，联合政府将授权政治和军事联合委员会按照1956年8月5日和10日的联合公报的精神进行协商。
    苏发努冯亲王是在11月7日到达万象的。他同富马亲王就实现1956年8月5日和10日老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队所签订的两个联合公报中所规定的有关按照日内瓦协议充分解决老挝问题的各项大的原则问题交换了意见。
    29日的联合公报说，两位亲王一致认为，双方之间的亲密和互相了解的气氛比以前有了发展，并且感到，政治和军事联合委员会为了寻求执行上述两个声明的确实措施，已经从9月26日起举行的会议的初步阶段中取得了良好的结果，例如先后签订了停止敌对行动的协议，关于和平中立政策的协议、保障寮国公民权利的协议。
    两位亲王一致认为，所签订的这项协议有必要广泛地进行宣传和传达，以回答全国人民的期待。
    两位亲王一致认为，对于尚未解决的问题，如：保障人民的自由民主权利、恢复政治犯的自由、补充普选、解决两省政权以及军事等问题，政治和军事联合委员会的双方代表团曾经进行了详细的讨论，双方的意见也接近一致，因此，双方代表团应该互相努力忍让，以便更迅速、更好地达成协议。
    关于在全国进行补充普选的问题，两位亲王都同意，在即将由国会起草的选举法中，必须根据秘密投票方式和直接、自由、平等的原则保障所有男女公民的选举权和被选举权，同时必须采取措施保证选举的公平和不允许发生欺骗现象，这样才符合王国宪法的精神。
    联合公报最后说，为了使双方能够合情合理和顺利地按照全国人民的愿望来进行解决，两位亲王决定在必要时将再度会晤。
    新华社河内30日电　万象消息：老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队双方的政治代表团已经就保证寮国战斗部队和前抗战人员享有公民权利和参加王国各级政权的措施达成了具体协议。
    双方代表团为了协商这些具体措施，从11月6日到12月23日在万象开了四十多天的会议。
    在12月24日签订的这项协议规定，“寮国爱国战线”和其他青年、妇女等政治组织有权利在全国各地进行活动，建立办事处、设立分会和出版刊物等，王国政府保证给予便利。
    寮国战斗部队、与寮国战斗部队有关系的人以及前抗战人员都享有公民的各项民主自由权利。王国政府禁止对他们采取分别对待、歧视、报复措施和侵犯他们的民主自由权利，违反者将遭到法院的起诉。
    寮国干部和前抗战人员能够参加王国的各级政权和各个专业部门的工作。他们参加抗战的年限将称为为王国服务的年限，原来级别待遇不变。寮国颁发的文凭和证明书得视为与王国颁发的具有同等效力。寮国颁发的奖状应当都能够保持，作为受奖者在王国政权下对老挝的功勋。
    双方的政治联合委员会将成立一个联合小组，负责安排寮国干部和前抗战人员的工作和级别。王国政府将根据政治联合委员会的决定来分配他们的工作和决定级别。
