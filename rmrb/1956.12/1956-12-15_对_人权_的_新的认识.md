International Notes

	A "New Understanding" of "Human Rights"

	President Eisenhower has recently become suddenly concerned about "human rights."

	A few days ago, he announced that December 10, 1956—the eighth anniversary of the United Nations General Assembly's adoption of the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights"—would be designated as "United Nations Human Rights Day." On that day, he issued a statement, delivering an impassioned high-sounding speech.

	Why did Eisenhower suddenly think of "human rights"? The President said: The fate of the Hungarian counter-revolutionary bandits filled his "heart with sorrowful emotions," so he believes that this year "the free world has extremely urgent reasons to commemorate Human Rights Day with a new understanding and determination."

	Everyone saw that when the Hungarian counter-revolutionary bandits were using inhuman means to kill upright patriots, Eisenhower secretly rejoiced and remained silent; but when these murderers were suppressed, "sorrowful emotions" surged into the President's heart. It turns out that in the President's view, "human rights" are the "rights" of executioners to kill, arson, and commit crimes; if someone stops these executioners' terrorist acts, then "human rights" have been "denied."

	In fact, the demand for a "new understanding" of "human rights" is not a new idea first proposed by Eisenhower. In the United States, the "Bill of Rights," passed by the great ancestors of the American people in 1791 and included in the Constitution, has long been regarded by the ruling group as an eyesore that is out of touch with the times. Therefore, in mid-December 1952, they moved the original manuscript of the Constitution, which was written with the "Bill of Rights," away from the eyes of the people and buried it underground. As a result, the Ku Klux Klan, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Un-American Activities Committee breathed a sigh of relief, and they became even more unscrupulous in exercising their "human rights" to massacre black people, suppress workers, and persecute progressives.

	I remember in January 1952, Mr. José Figueres, who had served as President of the Republic of Costa Rica, answered the question "Are there human rights in the United States?" in the American magazine "Economics and Sociology." He said: "Only on paper, only on the original manuscript of the Constitution." However, the former President of the Republic of Costa Rica should also know that today, what is written on the original manuscript of the Constitution in the United States no longer counts as "human rights," and the American ruling group already has a "new understanding" of "human rights."

### 对“人权”的“新的认识”

    对“人权”的“新的认识”
    艾森豪威尔总统最近突然关心起“人权”来了。
    几天以前，他宣布把1956年12月10日——联合国大会通过“世界人权宣言”的八周年纪念日——规定为“联合国人权日”。到了这一天，他又发表一个声明，慷慨激昂地唱了一番高调。
    艾森豪威尔为什么忽然起想“人权”来了呢？总统先生说：匈牙利反革命匪徒的下场使得他“心中充满了悲痛的情绪”，因此他认为今年“自由世界有极为迫切的原因要以新的认识和决心来纪念人权日”。
    谁都看见：当匈牙利反革命匪徒用惨无人道的手段杀害正直的爱国者的时候，艾森豪威尔暗暗称快，默不作声；但是当这些杀人犯被镇压下去以后，“悲痛的情绪”就涌上了总统的心头。原来，在总统先生看来，“人权”就是刽子手杀人放火的“权利”；如果有人制止了这些刽子手的恐怖行为，那就是“人权”受到了“否认”。
    其实，要求对“人权”有“新的认识”，这也并不是艾森豪威尔首先提出的新见解。在美国，由美国人民的伟大祖先在1791年通过而列入宪法的“人权法案”，早就被统治集团看成不合时宜的眼中钉了。因此，他们在1952年12月中旬把写着“人权法案”的宪法原稿从人民的眼前搬开而埋葬地下。于是，三K党、联邦调查局、非美活动委员会轻松地吐了一口气，他们就更加肆无忌惮地来放手行使他们残杀黑人、镇压工人、迫害进步人士的“人权”了。
    记得在1952年1月，曾经当过哥斯达黎加共和国总统的豪塞·费盖列斯先生在美国“经济学和社会学”杂志上答复过“在美国有没有人权”这个问题。他说：“只在纸上，只在宪法原稿上。”但是，这位哥斯达黎加共和国过去的总统还应该知道，今天在美国写在宪法原稿上的早就算不得“人权”了，美国统治集团对于“人权”已经有了“新的认识”。　（元）
