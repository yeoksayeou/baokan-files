Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 15th. The Mozitan Reservoir project on the Huai River, which began construction over two months ago, has started to pour the dam. The crest of this dam is 320 meters long and the dam body is 80 meters high. In the years with the highest floods, it can store 288 million cubic meters of water.

    After the completion of the Mozitan Reservoir, it will form a strong defense line together with the Fozi Ridge Reservoir, Xianghongdian Reservoir, and the Lianghekou Reservoir, which is about to start construction, to block and store the floodwaters of the Pi River, eliminate disasters in the Pi River and reduce disasters in the Huai River. It can also be used to develop hydropower and irrigation.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 15th. Another new forest railway is being built in the Greater Khingan Mountains. It starts from Yituli River and goes east, traversing the Oroqen Autonomous Banner, and will be connected to the railway from Qiqihar City to Nenjiang, becoming an important timber transportation line in the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area. At present, the roadbed has extended more than 100 kilometers eastward from the Yituli River, of which 62 kilometers have been opened to traffic.

    This railway is the sixth forest railway built by the state in the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area in recent years. The other five railways are connected to railways such as Tongbin (Harbin) Zhou (Manzhouli) and Bai (Baichengzi) A (Arshan), with a total length of 455 kilometers. Tens of thousands and millions of cubic meters of timber are transported out from these railways every year to support construction in various places. Now, forest cities have emerged along these newly built railways, with more than 100,000 family members of forestry workers living there.

    Xinhua News Agency. The Wujiang Bridge, a challenging project on the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, is under construction. Four pits have been dug on a slope of 4,000 square meters on the north bank of the river. These are the foundations for three bridge piers and the Chongqing abutment.

    The Wujiang River is one of the famous natural barriers in China, with wide rivers, rapid currents, hidden reefs, and cliffs on both sides. There is an old saying: "Having traveled all over the world, it is difficult to cross the Wujiang River." When the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army marched to this place, they were blocked by the enemy, and after two days and two nights of fierce fighting, they were able to cross the river victoriously.

    Xinhua News Agency. A new highway is being built in northern Tibet from Heihe to Qamdo. This highway will pass through the Thirty-Nine Clan Grassland and connect the Heia Highway and the eastern section of the Kangzang Highway in Qamdo into a single line.

    At present, more than 70 kilometers of this highway have been built. It is expected that it will be open to traffic to Dingqing, the central city of the Thirty-Nine Clan Grassland, in early spring next year.

    Xinhua News Agency. A factory producing natural water softeners is under construction in Fushun and will be completed and put into production in the second quarter of next year.

    The steam water for all factories, mines, and locomotives must be softened by water softeners, otherwise rust will grow on the inner walls of the steam equipment, shortening the service life of the equipment. In the past, most of the water softeners used in our country had to be imported. After the new factory is completed, it will use natural water softeners - zeolite - mined from the Fushun coal mine for processing. This kind of water softener has very good softening efficiency and the price is about 80% cheaper than imported ones.

    Xinhua News Agency. A state-owned meat processing plant built in Jining was put into production on the 13th.

    This factory has slaughtering, refrigeration, blood meal, and bone glue workshops; all the machines are made in our country, and can process 275 cattle and 1,650 sheep every eight hours.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, 15th. The main factory buildings of the Jilin Fertilizer Plant, which has 14 basic workshops and 13 auxiliary workshops, have been basically completed, and most of the machinery and equipment have been installed.

    It is expected that during the spring plowing period in March next year, the three workshops of the ammonia processing system will be able to use synthetic ammonia from brother factories to produce nitrogen chemical fertilizers for farmers that can significantly increase crop yields.

    磨子潭水库浇筑拦河坝
    据新华社蚌埠15日电　开工两个多月的淮河磨子潭水库工程，已经开始浇筑拦河坝，这座拦河坝的坝顶全长三百二十公尺，坝身最高八十公尺，在最高洪水年份，可以蓄水两亿八千八百万公方。
    磨子潭水库完成后，将和佛子岭水库、响洪甸水库及将要开工的两河口水库共同组成一道拦蓄淠河洪水的坚强防线，消除淠河及减轻淮河的灾害，还可以利用它来发展水电及灌溉事业。
    大兴安岭又修一条铁路
    新华社呼和浩特15日电　大兴安岭又兴建一条新的森林铁路。它从伊图里河东进，横穿鄂伦春自治旗，将同齐齐哈尔市通往嫩江的铁路相衔接，成为大兴安岭林区一条重要的运材干线。现在路基已经从伊图里河向东伸延了一百多公里，其中有六十二公里已经通车。
    这条铁路是最近几年内国家在大兴安岭林区修建的第六条森林铁路。其他五条铁路是同滨（哈尔滨）洲（满洲里）、白（白城子）阿（阿尔山）等铁路相联结，总长四百五十五公里。从这些铁路上，每年都有数十万和上百万立方公尺的木材运出来，支援各地建设。现在，在这些新建铁路两旁已经出现了一座座森林城市，居住的林业工人家属有十万人以上。
    川黔路上架设乌江大桥
    据新华社讯　川黔铁路上工程艰巨的乌江大桥正在施工。在江北岸四千平方公尺的一片斜坡上，已经挖好四个坑。这是三个桥墩和重庆桥台的基础。
    乌江是我国有名的天险之一，江宽水急，暗礁四伏，两岸多是刀削般的悬崖绝壁。古来流传着这样的话：遍行天下路，难过乌江渡。中国工农红军长征到此，曾经被敌人据险阻拦，经过两天两夜激战，才得胜利过江。
    西藏北部修筑新公路
    据新华社讯　西藏北部正在新修一条黑河到昌都的公路。这条公路将穿越三十九族草原，把黑阿公路和康藏公路昌都以东段连接成一条线。
    现在，这条公路已经修筑好七十多公里，预计明年初春，可以通车到三十九族草原的中心城市丁青。
    抚顺兴建天然软水剂厂
    据新华社讯　一座生产天然软水剂的工厂正在抚顺兴建，将在明年第二季度建成投入生产。
    所有工厂、矿山和火车头的蒸汽用水，都必须经过软水剂软化，否则蒸汽设备的内壁就会生水锈，使设备使用年限缩短。我国过去所用的软水剂大部分要依赖国外进口。新的工厂建成以后，将采用抚顺煤矿开采出来的天然软水剂——泡沸石进行加工。这种软水剂软化效率很好，价格比国外进口的便宜80％左右。
    集宁肉类加工厂完工
    据新华社讯　在集宁建设的一座国营肉类联合加工厂，13日投入生产。
    这座工厂里有屠宰、冷藏、血粉和骨胶等车间；全部机器都是我国制造的，每八小时能加工牛二百七十五头、羊一千六百五十只。
    吉林肥料厂基本建成
    据新华社吉林15日电　拥有十四个基本车间和十三个辅助车间的吉林肥料厂，主要厂房已经基本建成，大部分机械设备也都安装起来了。
    预计在明年3月春耕时期，氨加工系统的三个车间就可以利用兄弟厂的合成氨，为农民生产出能够显著增加农作物产量的氮素化学肥料。
