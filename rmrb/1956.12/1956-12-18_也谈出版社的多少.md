Also Discussing the Number of Publishing Houses
　　Yan Hao

Comrade Zigang suggested that there are too many publishing houses in Beijing, while Comrade Lizhi believes the opposite, that there are too few publishing houses with distinctive characteristics. My view is that both situations exist and both are problematic.

Currently, almost every ministry of the government has a publishing house, especially in the fields of finance, economics, industry, and transportation. As you can see, there's the Finance and Economics Publishing House, and then also separate ones for finance, banking, and statistics. There's the Architectural Engineering Publishing House, and also the Building Materials Industry Publishing House. Moreover, after the Ministry of Fuel Industry was divided into three departments, the Fuel Industry Publishing House magically split into three, hanging out the shingles for coal, electricity, and petroleum respectively. Furthermore, as soon as the Ministry of Forest Industry was established, it rushed to apply to establish a Forest Industry Publishing House in addition to the existing Forestry Publishing House. There's a common-sense issue worth raising here: publishing houses must first have a team of authors. We've now established so many publishing houses with such finely divided specialties, and some of them are quite large. Have we considered this issue? I don't know how many petroleum professionals there are in the country, but I imagine that the petroleum industry hasn't been around for many years in our country, so this team must not be very large. Even if everyone could write a book, is it really necessary to have a specialized publishing house for it?

A lack of original works leads to relying on translation. But, "Even the longest day must end," and recently, one publishing house asked: We've translated almost everything in the past few years, what do we do next?

Our construction has only just begun, and various professional teams are only just growing. The writing strength of various professions must be extremely limited. However, the publishing industry, regardless of the "foundation," is single-mindedly pursuing the establishment of finely divided professional publishing houses. Isn't this out of touch with reality? Why can't we concentrate resources and have only a few, or each ministry only establishes a compilation and translation office, and then entrusts a certain publishing house to print them? In my opinion, when something that only needs one person to do, and that one person can do, requires three people to do it, that's called "too much."

Of course, the problem of "too much" isn't limited to finance, economics, and industry. I'm also very skeptical about the newly established Drama Publishing House. Isn't there a "script shortage" now? Hasn't the People's Literature Publishing House been able to meet the publishing needs of scripts?

Having a temple requires monks, and setting up a publishing house requires a team of people. The result is that cadres at the lower levels are increasingly being drawn away, making work more difficult; and life in Beijing becomes increasingly tense.

Comrade Zigang's suggestion of "integration" makes a lot of sense from this perspective and is worth considering.

How some publishing houses can be run with distinctive characteristics and not overlap with each other is also a big problem. Especially since this year's "high tide," everyone has been crowding into the same alley like a swarm of bees. The result is that there are forty-two kinds of books on the same topic of "raising pigs" nationwide; and thirty-eight kinds of books on the same topic of "eliminating the four pests" nationwide. The China Youth Publishing House and the Children's Publishing House also joined in the fun, each publishing a series of popular agricultural production knowledge pamphlets. The only difference is that one addresses "young friends" and the other addresses "little friends."

Publishing houses that are divided by region and target audience tend to only consider meeting the readers' various needs from their own little perspective, forgetting that regardless of whether a book is published in Shanghai or Chongqing, there are no strict boundaries when they circulate nationwide; and the clientele of each publishing house includes both workers and youth. Forgetting this and acting as if no one else exists will lead to unknowingly trying to be all-encompassing, striving for "perfection" in everything, and ultimately, everyone ends up looking almost the same.

It's not enough to simply pay attention to the characteristics of the target audience and region. Some books are easy to make distinctive, but some are difficult. If you don't believe it, it's best to flip through the thirty-eight kinds of "eliminating the four pests" and see what the differences are? Think about how much difference you can actually write?

Therefore, when mentioning characteristics, we must also consider the division of labor and the scale of some publishing houses divided by region and target audience. In my opinion, we can make major adjustments, clarify the focus of their respective publications, narrow some scopes, and not try to encompass everything. In particular, we must oppose taking quantity as victory, pursuing an increase in variety in generalities, and blindly cooperating with common tasks, and even publishing so-called "statement books" while knowing they are redundant.

As Comrade Lizhi said, what people need are publishing houses with distinct characteristics. Some "comprehensive" publishing houses that are currently so common throughout the world really need to change.

[Editor's note: After the publication of articles about publishing houses by Comrades Zigang and Lizhi in the supplement, we have received different responses from many readers and publishing workers. We now publish an article by Comrade Yan Hao as a summary, and the rest will not be answered one by one.]

    也谈出版社的多少
    颜浩
    子冈同志提出北京各种出版社办得太多，黎之同志认为相反，倒是有特色的出版社太少。我的看法是：两种情况都有，都成问题。
    现在几乎政府有一个部就有一个出版社，尤以财经、工业、交通方面特别茂盛。君不见：有了财政经济出版社，还有财政、金融、统计三家；有了建筑工程出版社，还有建筑材料工业出版社。又不见：燃料工业部分成三个部以后，燃料工业出版社就一气化三清，分别挂出了煤炭、电力、石油三面招牌。更不见：森林工业部一成立，也赶着申请在林业出版社以外，再建立森林工业出版社。这里有个常识问题值得提出来，就是出版社首先要有著作的队伍。我们现在办了这么许多分工极细的出版社，而且有的规模甚大，究竟对这问题考虑了没有？我不知道全国有多少搞石油的专业人才，但设想石油工业在我们国家并没有多少年历史，这支队伍一定不会大。就算个个都能写书，是否已经非有一个专业出版社不可了？
    缺少著作就靠翻译。但是，“天长地久有时尽”，最近就有个出版社提出：几年来翻译得差不多了，以后怎么办？
    我们的建设才只是开始，各种专业队伍刚刚在成长。各种专业的著作力量不能不是极其有限的。但，出版事业却不问“基础”如何，只是一个劲儿细分专业的办起来，难道这不是脱离实际吗？为什么不可以集中一些，只办几个，或者各部都只设编译室，然后交给某一家出版社去印行呢？我看，只够一人办、而一人也办得了的事，却要设三人来办，这种情况就叫做“多”了。
    当然，“多”的问题不只财经、工业这一方面。我对才办的戏剧出版社也很怀疑。现在不是“剧本荒”么？难道人民文学出版社已经满足不了剧本的出版要求了么？
    有庙就要有和尚，办一个出版社就得有一套人马。结果是下面干部越抽越空，工作越困难；而北京城里的生活，也就越来越紧张。
    子冈同志提出“综合”一下，从这方面看，很有道理，值得考虑。
    还有些出版社，要怎样办得有特色，不互相重复，的确也是大问题。特别是今年“高潮”以来，大家一窝蜂，挤着走一条胡同。其结果是：同一“养猪”，全国出了四十二种；同一“除四害”，全国出了三十八种。中国青年出版社和少年儿童出版社也凑了热闹，各出一套通俗的农业生产知识小丛书。所不同的，只是一个口称青年朋友，另一个则口称小朋友而已。
    以地区分、以对象分的出版社，很容易只从自己一个摊摊来考虑满足读者各方面的需要，忘了不问是上海出的书、重庆出的书，它们在全国流通起来，并无什么严格的界限；而各个出版社的主顾之中，也都有工人和青年。忘了这一条而旁若无人，就会不知不觉地包打天下，处处“求全”，而终于，彼此都办成差不多的面孔。
    仅仅说注意对象和地区的特点是不够的。特点这一条，有些书好办，有些书就很难。如若不信，最好是去翻翻三十八种“除四害”，看看它们到底有什么不同？想想究竟能写出多大的不同？
    所以，提到特色，就不能不再考虑一下以地区和对象分的一些出版社的分工和办大办小的问题。我看，可以大加调整，明确它们各自出书的重点，缩小一些范围，不要都包揽一大堆。特别要反对以多为胜，在一般化中追求增加品种，和盲目配合共同的任务，甚至明知重复，但也出下去的所谓“表态书”。
    诚如黎之同志所说，人们需要的是各有鲜明特色的出版社。像现在这样的滔滔者天下皆是也的一些“综合性”出版社，的确要变一变了。
    〔编者附记：副刊上发表了子冈、黎之两位同志的关于出版社的文章后，我们收到不少读者和出版工作者的不同的反应。现刊出颜浩同志的一篇，以作小结，其余就不一一作复了。〕
