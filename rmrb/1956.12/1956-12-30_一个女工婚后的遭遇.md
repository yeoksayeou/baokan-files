When I first came to the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory, the first female worker I became familiar with in the workshop was Wang Xizhen. At that time, she was working on a grinding machine and was also the leader of the Party小组 (small group); later, she was elected as a member of the workshop's branch committee. In her work, she was always active and responsible, diligent and conscientious, and able to endure hardship. She never uttered a word of complaint about work that others were unwilling to do when it was assigned to her. In the workshop, whenever she was mentioned, everyone praised her, saying, "She's truly a good girl."

Recently, when I saw her again, I found that she had become haggard and silent, and the smile that she often had on her face had disappeared. In less than two years, how could this lively, hardworking, and responsible girl have become like this?

Since Wang Xizhen got married last year, she soon became pregnant. She vomited all day long, and her face was as yellow as if it were covered with a sheet of yellow wax paper. Coincidentally, it was her turn to work the night shift at this time, starting work at twelve o'clock every night and not getting off work until the next morning. Because of her poor health, she originally planned to ask the workshop director, Zhao Chuanren, to change her shift and let her work the day shift temporarily. But on second thought, not long ago, when she first "reacted" (became aware of her pregnancy), she had made such a suggestion to Director Zhao. She worked the day shift for two weeks, but later Zhao Chuanren said that the production tasks were busy and asked her to work the night shift again. Such a suggestion would be useless to make. So, she had to work the night shift while ill.

Seeing that her body was gradually failing, her hands trembled when she held things; when she really couldn't hold on, she bit the bullet and asked the doctor and Director Zhao to discuss the matter of changing shifts. Who knew that Director Zhao frowned and waved his hand before she had finished speaking, saying, "Female workers in the workshop are really a headache. After they get married, it's either this or that; if she doesn't work the night shift, who will?"

Wang Xizhen was a stubborn girl. She didn't say anything after hearing these words, and silently walked into the workshop.

One night, Wang Xizhen dragged her heavy steps into the workshop. As soon as the machine tool started, everything went black before her eyes, and the room began to spin. She quickly turned off the power and leaned her body against the toolbox. Suddenly, with a "puff," she lost consciousness and collapsed.

With the rescue of the fellow workers, Wang Xizhen gradually woke up. The wound on her head was bleeding a lot, and the workers were bandaging her wound. At this time, Wu Mingzheng, the foreman on duty, also arrived. As soon as he entered the workshop, his primary concern was not the patient's injury, but he said with great regret, "Wang Xizhen, you won't be able to work tomorrow night, will you! The production task now..."

Wang Xizhen's injury was severe. After more than a month of recuperation, she finally recovered her health. A month later, she came to the workshop again. By this time, she was eight months pregnant, and some of the heavier work had to be helped by the handyman. This incident aroused the displeasure of the work section chief, Du Rongchang. He said unhappily, "What is such a woman still doing in the workshop?" In his opinion, it would be better for Wang Xizhen to simply remove her from the labor plan if she insisted on working. This way, in terms of tasks, fewer people would mean fewer tasks. So, he and the workshop director discussed and decided to ask Wang Xizhen to "rest."

However, how to solve the problem of wages for "early rest"? If it was calculated as sick leave or maternity leave, the medical clinic would not agree because the doctor also proved that she could indeed work for a period of time. If it was calculated as personal leave, there was even less reason. So, Wang Xizhen came to the workshop office and pleaded bitterly, saying, "If the workshop really doesn't need me, please introduce me to the cadre section, I believe the organization will definitely give me work to do." As she spoke, when she thought about leaving the workshop she was used to working in, leaving her beloved grinding machine, and leaving the comrades she had worked with, she felt a pang of sadness, and tears fell down her face.

At this time, the labor protection committee member of the trade union could no longer bear it and went to discuss it with Du Rongchang. After repeated negotiations, Du Rongchang reluctantly agreed to place her in the fitter team to "help" with work. From then on, Wang Xizhen accepted the previous "lesson" and dared not ask the handyman to help with even the heaviest work. She worked like this for more than forty days. Because she did not have proper rest before childbirth, she had a difficult labor at the time of delivery. After the doctor performed a cesarean section to rescue her, the lives of both mother and child were saved.

More than twenty days after giving birth, the room Wang Xizhen rented was bought by the factory. The general affairs section notified Wang Xizhen's mother to "move out immediately." Her mother pleaded with the administrator to wait until her daughter had completed her confinement before finding a house. The administrator said, "Wang Xizhen is a Party member and should take the lead." Where to move now? Wang Xizhen had no choice but to ask the general affairs section for a house. Unexpectedly, the reply she received was, "There are no houses, overcome your difficulties yourself!"

Calling for "taking the lead," calling for "overcoming difficulties," and with her husband working elsewhere, Wang Xizhen had no choice but to wear a headscarf during her confinement period and run around looking for a house.

Before starting work, Wang Xizhen heard that Director Zhao had a new plan, deciding that the workshop would not want any female workers at all. Why? Firstly, because Wang Xizhen's body had not fully recovered after her difficult labor, and she had to breastfeed after starting work. Secondly, another female worker in the workshop, Chen Weijun, was also pregnant. Although there were not many female workers in this factory, just these few had frightened Director Zhao; he had also made up his mind to send all the female workers to the cadre section. At first, Wang Xizhen didn't quite believe it, but later she met Wang Xiuying from the cadre section and learned that Director Zhao had gone to the cadre section to argue several times; and the cadre section was also very troubled by these matters. Because for a long time, a trend of belittling female workers had formed in the factory. No workshop wanted female workers, and some workshops would rather have male apprentices than female technicians. They all thought that female workers had "too much trouble" and were "useless." Therefore, after many female workers had children, the cadre section could not assign them work. Despite their excellent skills, they had to be asked to do odd jobs or work as nannies in nurseries.

When her maternity leave was over, Wang Xizhen came to the workshop. The first thing the work section chief, Du Rongchang, asked was, "Did you bring your child to the nursery? Are you breastfeeding yourself?" Wang Xizhen understood Du Rongchang's "intention" and immediately replied, "I leave my child at home and go back to breastfeed after work, ensuring that it doesn't affect production." Du Rongchang snorted and said, "We'll talk about it again tomorrow."

The next morning, Wang Xizhen went to work early as usual. Du Rongchang ran over and quietly said to her, "Wang Xizhen, there's no need for anyone on the grinding machine now. We're considering that you can't work the night shift, so change your job, okay?"

"Do what?"

"Do filing!"

"I've been doing grinding for more than four years. Why are you asking me to change my job after I had a child?"

After Wang Xizhen did filing, everything was unfamiliar, and her original skills were no longer useful. Soon, she was transferred to the workshop to serve as an education cadre. From then on, Wang Xizhen finally completely "changed her job."

Now, whenever people ask about her work, she always says with tears in her eyes and a longing heart, "My favorite is still the grinding machine..."

    一个女工婚后的遭遇
    时格
    当我第一次来到南京机床厂，在车间里首先熟悉的就是女工王希珍。那时，她还在磨床上工作，并担任党小组长，后来又被选为车间的支部委员。工作上，一贯积极负责，勤勤恳恳，吃苦耐劳，别人不愿干的活，只要分配给她，从来也没有讲过一个不字。在车间里，只要一提到她，大家都称赞说：“真是个好姑娘”。
    最近我又一次见到她的时候，发现她已变得憔悴和沉默了，脸上常有的笑容也消失了。两年不到的时间，这个活泼、勤劳、勇于负责的姑娘怎么会变成这个样子哩？
    王希珍自从去年结婚以后，不久就怀了孕，成天呕啊吐的，脸黄得像蒙上了一张黄蜡纸。碰巧这时又轮到她作夜班，每天晚上十二点上班，一直要到第二天早晨才下班。由于身体不好，她本来打算向车间主任赵传仁请求调换一下，暂时让她作白班。可是转念一想，不久以前当她刚“反应”的时候，曾经向赵主任提过这样的意见，做了两个星期的白班，后来赵传仁说生产任务忙，又叫她做夜班了。这样的意见，提也是白提。于是，她只好带病作夜班。
    眼看身体渐渐支持不住了，手里拿东西也要颤抖；在实在支持不下的时候，她硬着头皮，请医生和赵主任商量调班的事。谁知赵主任话还没听完，就皱着眉头摆着手说：“女工在车间里真叫人伤脑筋，结了婚不是这样就是那样；她不作夜班叫谁来作？”
    王希珍是个倔强的姑娘，听了这话没说什么，就不声不响地走进车间去了。
    一天夜里，王希珍拖着沉重的脚步走进了车间，机床刚开动，眼前就一阵黑，房子也旋转起来了；她赶紧关上电门，把身子伏在工具箱上。突然“噗”的一声，由于失去知觉而昏倒下去。
    在工人同志们的抢救下，王希珍渐渐苏醒过来；头部的创伤流了许多血，工人们正在为她包扎伤口。这时值班工长吴明政也赶来了。他一进车间，首先关心的不是病人的伤势，而是惋惜万分地说：“王希珍，你明晚不能上班了吧！这下生产任务……”
    王希珍的伤势很重，经过一个多月的休养，才算恢复了健康。一个月以后，她又来到车间了。这时她已经怀孕八个月了，有些过于笨重的工作，不得不请杂工帮忙搬动一下。这件事又引起了工段长杜荣昌的反感。他很不高兴地说：“像这样的女人还留在车间里干啥？”在他看来，王希珍坚持上班，不如干脆从劳动计划中除去，这样，从任务来看，少一个人就可少一份任务。于是他和车间主任商议决定叫王希珍“休息”。
    可是，“提早休息”，工资又如何解决呢？算病假或产假吧，医务所不同意，因为医生也证明她确实还可以工作一段时间；算事假吧，更没有理由。于是王希珍来到了车间办公室，又苦苦地哀求说：“如果车间里实在不需要我，就介绍我到干部科去吧，我相信组织上一定会给我工作做的”。嘴里这么讲，心里一想到离开工作惯了的车间，离开她心爱的磨床，离开一道工作过的同志们，一阵辛酸，泪水就??地掉了下来。
    这时，工会劳保委员再也忍不住了，便去和杜荣昌商量，经过再三交涉，杜荣昌才勉强同意把她安置在钳锉组“帮助”工作。从此，王希珍接受了以前的“教训”，就是再重的活，也不敢要杂工帮助了。就这样一直干了四十多天。由于产前没有适当的休息，结果在临产时就发生难产，经过医生剖腹抢救，才算挽回了母子俩的生命。
    产后二十多天，王希珍租的一间房子为工厂收买了；总务科通知王希珍的母亲“立即搬家”。她母亲恳求管理员等女儿满了月再找房子。管理员说：“王希珍是党员，应该带头”。现在往何处搬呢？王希珍只得向总务科要房子。想不到得到的答复是：“没有房子，有困难自己克服”！
    叫“带头”，叫“克服困难”，爱人又在外边工作，王希珍无可奈何，只好在月子里顶着头巾，为找房子而四处奔波。
    上班前，王希珍听说赵主任又有了一个新的打算，决定车间里一律不要女工。为什么呢？一来因为王希珍难产后身体还没有完全恢复健康，上工以后还要喂奶；二来车间里另一个女工陈维君又正在怀孕期中。虽然这个厂的女工并不多，可是就这一些，已经把赵主任吓坏了；他还下定决心，要把所有的女工都送到干部科去。起初，王希珍还有些不大相信，后来又遇到了干部科的王秀英，才知道赵主任已到干部科去吵过几次；并且为了这些事，干部科也大伤脑筋。因为很久以来，厂内已形成了一种轻视女工的风气，哪个车间也不愿要女工，甚至有的车间宁愿要男徒工而不要女技工，他们都认为女工“麻烦多”，“不顶事”。所以许多女工在生了孩子以后，干部科就无法分配，尽管技术很好，也只得叫她们做杂工或到托儿所当褓姆。
    产假满了，王希珍来到车间，工段长杜荣昌第一句话就问：“你是否把孩子带到托儿所来？是否由你本人喂奶？”王希珍明白杜荣昌的“用意”，立即回答说：“我把孩子放在家里，等下班以后再去喂奶，保证不影响生产”。杜荣昌哼了一声说：“明天来再讲”。
    第二天一早，王希珍和平常一样的提前上班。杜荣昌却跑来悄悄地对她说：“王希珍，现在磨床上不需要人了，我们考虑你不能做夜班，改行吧？”
    “做什么？”
    “做钳锉吧！”
    “我搞了四年多的磨床，怎么生了孩子就叫我改行？”
    王希珍做钳锉以后，什么都很陌生，原来的技术也用不上了。不久又调到车间担任教育干事。从此，王希珍终于彻底“改行”了。
    现在每当人们问到她的工作时，她总是眼泪满眶地带着眷恋的心情对人说：“我最心爱的还是磨床呵……”。
