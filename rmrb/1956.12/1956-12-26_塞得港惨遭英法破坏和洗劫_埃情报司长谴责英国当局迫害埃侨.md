Xinhua News Agency, December 25th -- TASS, Cairo, December 24th: According to the "Al-Ahram" newspaper, a preliminary investigation by the Port Said Municipal Council has determined that nearly nine thousand houses in the city were completely destroyed by the British and French invaders, and more than three thousand houses were severely damaged. In addition, the invaders also destroyed, set fire to, and looted many government agencies and enterprises.

"Al-Ahram" said that when the French troops left Port Fuad, they destroyed many factories belonging to the Suez Canal Authority and transported away many valuable machines and equipment.

Xinhua News Agency, December 25th, Cairo News: The Director of Egyptian Intelligence, Colonel Hatem, issued a statement on the evening of the 24th, condemning the British authorities for persecuting Egyptian nationals residing in Britain.

The statement said: "Some Egyptians who recently returned to Cairo from Britain said that British police had been monitoring their movements, searching their homes more than once a day, ordering hotel staff to evict them, ordering banks not to honor their checks, eavesdropping on their phone calls, and not delivering their mail."

Hatem said that Egyptians leaving Britain were only allowed to take ten pounds each.

Hatem also said: "Egyptian students have been persecuted by university professors who do not respect the dignity of the university."

Xinhua News Agency, December 25th, New York News: The chairman of the "Emergency Committee for Relief of Egyptian War Victims," Russell Stevenson, representing twelve American churches and private organizations, condemned Britain, France, and Israel for "committing unjust acts against the Egyptian people" and for "seriously violating the laws of morality."

Stevenson recently made a field investigation in Egypt. After returning to New York, he talked about what he saw and heard: "Even with the most conservative estimate, the death toll (in Egypt) is 2,000. I don't know how many people were injured. Among the schools and social service agencies in the (Nile) Delta, there are 61,000 refugees, and another 66,000 people are living with relatives or friends. In addition, there are 7,000 people from Sinai living in East Kantara."

Stevenson highly praised the "admirable plan" formulated by the Egyptian government to relieve the victims of the invasion. He said that in addition to emergency relief work, the Egyptian government "has a clear plan to rebuild Port Said and other cities and villages damaged by the war."

    塞得港惨遭英法破坏和洗劫
    埃情报司长谴责英国当局迫害埃侨
    新华社25日讯　塔斯社开罗24日讯：据“金字塔报”报道，塞得港市政委员会经初步调查后确定市内有将近九千幢住宅被英法侵略者完全毁坏，有三千多幢房屋受到严重损坏。此外，侵略者还破坏、纵火烧毁和洗劫了许多政府机关和企业。
      “金字塔报”说，法国军队在离开福德港时破坏了属于苏伊士运河管理局的许多工厂，并且运走了许多贵重的机器和装备。
    据新华社25日讯　开罗消息：埃及情报司长哈特姆上校24日晚上发表声明，谴责英国当局迫害旅居英国的埃及侨民。
    声明说：“最近从英国返回开罗的一些埃及人说，英国警察曾经监视他们的行动，一天不只一次地搜查他们的住宅，下令旅馆人员把他们赶走，下令银行对他们的支票不兑现，偷听他们的电话，并且不给他们寄信。”
    哈特姆说，离开英国的埃及人每人只准带十个英镑。
    哈特姆还说：“埃及的留学生受到了那些不尊重大学尊严的大学教授们的迫害。”
    据新华社25日讯　纽约消息：由美国十二个教会和私人机构的代表组成的“救济埃及战争受害者紧急委员会”主席拉塞尔·史蒂文森谴责英、法和以色列三国“对埃及人民犯下了不正义的行动”，并且“严重地破坏了道义的法则”。
    史蒂文森最近曾经到埃及作了一次实地调查。他回到纽约后谈到他的所见所闻说：“即使作最保守的估计，（埃及的）死亡人数也有二千人。我不知多少人受了伤。在（尼罗河）三角洲上的学校和社会服务机构中间，有六万一千个难民，另外六万六千个人同亲戚或朋友住在一起。此外，还有从西奈来的七千个人住在东坎塔拉”。
    史蒂文森极口赞扬埃及政府制定的救济侵略的受害者的“值得赞扬的计划”。他说，除了紧急救济工作以外，埃及政府“有着明确的重建受战争破坏的塞得港和其他城市及乡村的计划。”
