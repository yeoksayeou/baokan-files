The current technical level of China's industrial sector is not commensurate with the tasks of China's industrial production and construction. During the first Five-Year Plan period, about 40% of the machinery and equipment needed for China's construction relied on foreign imports, and about 20% of the steel needed also relied on imports. Some of this is due to limitations in raw materials and equipment conditions, which currently cannot be manufactured in China at all; however, a large part of it is simply because we have not mastered the manufacturing technology, so we cannot produce it ourselves. During the first Five-Year Plan period, the machines and equipment manufactured by China itself were mostly copied according to foreign technical data. Although we have designed some important new products ourselves, they are basically of the nature of improved designs. During the first Five-Year Plan period, although we designed some major projects above the quota ourselves, we still could not independently solve many complex technical problems. Some projects, although designed and successfully constructed, were of poor quality and had many shortcomings. In particular, key important projects had to rely on foreign countries for design. As for very important industrial sectors such as the radio industry, organic synthetic chemical industry, mining and refining of rare metals, and peaceful use of atomic energy, some of them were just beginning to be established during the first Five-Year Plan period, some were just beginning to be tested, and some were almost non-existent.

Although China's current technical level in industry is very low, we must make up for those weak and blank important industrial sectors during the second Five-Year Plan period, so that China can be built into a technologically advanced and basically complete industrial system after the third Five-Year Plan or a little longer.

Is this possible? The possibility is fully present. In the past few years, in the process of recovery and construction, we have trained a group of technical backbones. The old engineering and technical personnel have more experience and higher enthusiasm, and the new engineering and technical personnel have also grown up under the leadership of domestic and foreign experts and have the ability to work independently. Various universities and secondary professional schools have supplied a large number of new forces to the industrial sector. In addition, with the strong assistance of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, they selflessly provide us with valuable technical data, send experts to directly guide us, and continue to help us design and manufacture those particularly important and difficult projects and equipment. It should be said that we already have the basic conditions to quickly master advanced technology.

The problem now is that some economic leading organs, enterprise leaders, and engineering and technical personnel lack confidence and courage in quickly mastering advanced technology. Some leaders emphasize that China's technical level is low and its strength is weak, and they are afraid of making mistakes, so they dare not let go and support engineering and technical personnel and lower-level units to try, dare not assign tasks of self-design or self-manufacture, and are not determined to draw more engineering and technical personnel to carry out design and research work, losing the spirit of active progress. It must be pointed out that if we want to strive to master advanced technology in the shortest possible time, we must first break this conservative thinking and boldly practice. Of course, our emphasis on confidence and courage does not mean advocating recklessness. Our own design and independent manufacturing must go through the steps of learning and imitation, and take a humble and cautious attitude. Only in this way can we quickly and reliably gradually master the world's advanced technology.

Advanced technology, in the final analysis, depends on people to master it. We now have a group of backbones who are politically active and have a certain level of technical skills, but the problem of people has not been completely solved. First of all, the existing technical forces have many that have not been able to fully play their role. A few leading personnel in enterprise units have sectarianism and insufficient trust in non-Party engineering and technical personnel, which has suppressed their enthusiasm and creativity. There are also many leading personnel in enterprise units who, although they attach importance to the Party's policy on uniting senior intellectuals, are more concerned about them in terms of life. These leaders let go of the work of engineering and technical personnel, but mostly just ask them to deal with daily affairs and solve technical problems on the periphery, and do not pay attention to creating conditions for them, organizing them in a planned way to study and solve major problems that are decisive for the technical progress of the enterprise or unit. Some also cause a lot of waste of labor of engineering and technical personnel and greatly hinder technological progress due to shortcomings in leadership work, such as unclear policies and frequently changing plans. Therefore, if we want to master advanced technology in the shortest possible time, we must further exert the role of engineering and technical personnel, especially senior technical personnel, and make them the core of uniting young technical personnel and the main force in striving for technological progress. Secondly, in order to quickly master advanced technology, the insufficient number of technical personnel is also a very important problem. Various universities and secondary professional schools must also shoulder heavy tasks and actively supply the industrial sector with high-quality new forces.

In order to grasp advanced technology as soon as possible, it is also necessary to strengthen scientific research work. The task we face is to design technically complex modern projects and products ourselves, and to establish new industrial sectors that China has never had before on the ground. This includes a series of complex and advanced technical problems that must be solved through repeated research and experimentation. In particular, to fundamentally change the backward state of China's technology and to bring China's technology close to the world's advanced level, it is unimaginable to be separated from scientific research work. Therefore, we must not only strengthen the work of specialized scientific research institutions, but also establish and strengthen scientific research institutions in various industrial sectors and important enterprises. It is necessary to make the research work of basic theory and the research work of technical application well combined, complement each other, and promote each other.

To quickly master new technologies, there must be strong organizational work, unified leadership and planning. Each new technology must designate certain departments and a group of cadres to be responsible for learning and research, and carry out technical intelligence work to understand the development trends of new technologies in the world; to collect and organize various technical materials and books, and create conditions for the promotion of new technologies in all aspects.

With the leadership of the Party, the assistance of fraternal countries, the basic technical forces, and the development of scientific research work, China's industry will certainly be able to master the world's advanced technology in a relatively short period of time, making China a technologically advanced industrial country with a complete system.

    尽快地掌握先进技术
    目前我国工业部门的技术水平，同我国工业生产和建设的任务是不相适应的。在第一个五年计划期间，我国建设所需要的机器和设备有40％左右依靠外国进口，所需要的钢材也有20％左右依靠进口。其中有一部分受原料和设备条件的限制，在我国目前根本无法制造；但是，也有很大一部分仅仅是由于我们没有掌握制造的技术，所以不能自制。在第一个五年计划期间，我国自己制造的机器和设备，绝大部分都是按照国外的技术资料仿制的。我们自己虽然也曾经设计了一些重要的新产品，但基本上还是属于改进设计的性质。第一个五年计划期间，我们虽然自己设计了一些限额以上的大工程；但是，许多复杂的技术问题我们还不能独立解决。有的工程虽然设计出来，建设成功了，但是质量不高，缺点很多。特别是关键性的重要工程项目，更要依靠国外代为设计。至于无线电工业、有机合成化学工业、稀有金属的开采和提炼、原子能的和平利用等十分重要的工业部门，在第一个五年计划期间，我们有的是刚刚开始建立，有的才开始进行试验，有的还几乎没有。
    虽然我国工业目前的技术水平很低，但是，我们必须在第二个五年计划期内，补足那些薄弱的和空白的重要工业部门，使我国经过第三个五年计划或稍多一点的时间，建成一个技术先进的、基本上完整的工业体系。
    这是不是可能呢？可能性是充分存在的。几年来，在恢复和建设过程中，我们已经锻炼出来一批技术骨干。老的工程技术人员经验更多了，积极性更高了，新的工程技术人员也在国内外的专家带领下成长起来，有了独立工作的能力。各个高等学校和中等专业学校给工业部门输送了大批的新生力量。再加上苏联和其他兄弟国家的大力援助，他们无私地给我们提供宝贵的技术资料，派遣专家来直接指导，并且继续帮助我们设计和制造那些特殊重要的困难的工程和设备。应该说，我们已经具备了迅速掌握先进技术的基本条件。
    现在的问题是，有些经济领导机关、企业领导人员和工程技术人员，对迅速掌握先进技术的信心和勇气不足。有些领导人员强调我国的技术水平低，力量薄弱，怕出错，便不敢放手支持工程技术人员和下级单位去尝试，不敢布置自己设计或自己制造的任务，没有决心抽调出更多的工程技术人员来进行设计和研究工作，丧失了积极进取的精神。必须指出，我们要争取在尽量短的时间内掌握先进的技术，首先就要打破这种保守思想，大胆地实践。当然，我们强调要有信心和勇气，决不等于提倡蛮干。我们自己设计，独立制造，必须经过学习、仿造的步骤，采取虚心、谨慎的态度。只有这样，我们才能迅速而又可靠地逐步掌握世界上先进的技术。
    先进的技术归根结蒂要靠人来掌握。我们现在已经拥有一批政治上积极、技术上具有一定水平的骨干，但是，人的问题并没有完全解决。首先是现有的技术力量有许多没有能够充分发挥作用。有少数企业单位的领导人员，有宗派主义情绪，对非党的工程技术人员信任不够，使他们的积极性和创造性受到了压抑。还有许多企业单位的领导人员，虽然重视了党关于团结高级知识分子的政策，但是还只是从生活方面关心得比较多。这些领导人员对工程技术人员的工作是放手的，但多半只是叫他们应付日常的事务，解决枝节的技术问题，而没有注意给他们创造条件，有计划地组织他们去研究，解决对本企业、本单位的技术进步具有决定性的重大问题。也有的因为领导工作上的缺点，如方针不明确、计划多变等等，使工程技术人员的劳动遭到大量的浪费，技术的进步受到很大的阻碍。因此，我们如果要在尽量短的时间内掌握先进技术，就必须进一步发挥工程技术人员、特别是高级技术人员的作用，使他们成为团结青年技术人员的核心，成为争取技术进步的主力。其次，为了迅速掌握先进的技术，技术人员的数量不足也是一个很重要的问题。各个高等学校和中等专业学校还必须担负繁重的任务，积极地给工业部门输送质量优秀的新生力量。
    为了尽快地掌握先进的技术，还必须加强科学研究工作。我们面临的任务是自己设计技术复杂的现代化的工程和产品，是在平地上建立起我国过去从来没有的新工业部门。这里面包含一系列复杂的、高级的技术问题，必须经过反复的研究和试验才能解决。特别是要从根本上改变我国技术落后的状态，要使我国在技术上接近世界先进水平，离开科学研究工作是不能想像的。因此，我们不但要加强专门的科学研究机关的工作，并且要在各个工业部门和重要的企业中建立和加强科学研究机构。必须使基本理论的研究工作和技术应用的研究工作很好地结合起来，互相补充，互相推动。
    要很快地掌握新技术，需要有强有力的组织工作，要有统一的领导和规划。每一种新技术都要指定一定的部门和一批干部负责去学习、研究，并且开展技术情报工作，了解世界上新技术的发展动向；要收集、整理各种技术资料和图书，从各方面为新技术的推广创造条件。
    有党的领导，有兄弟国家的援助，有基本的技术力量，加上科学研究工作的开展，我国的工业一定能够在比较短的时间内掌握世界上的先进技术，使我国成为一个具有完整体系的、技术上先进的工业国家。
