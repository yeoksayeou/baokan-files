Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, December 1st: The Fuxin Coal Mine Xinqiu East Open-Pit Mine Party organization relied on workers to solve the problem of poor coal quality.

This open-pit mine's coal seam being mined this year is mixed with the same layer of rock. 80% of the coal mined in the first half of the year was low-quality coal. Because the coal quality was poor, it was repeatedly criticized and fined by users in various places.

In order to solve this problem, the party branch secretary held a forum with veteran workers and activists to study solutions with them. The workers put forward many suggestions. The workers believed that the blasting problem should be solved first, and coal and rock should be mined separately. Blast the rock first when rock is on top, and blast the coal first when coal is on top; when loading and transporting, workers should manually pick out the stones; a truck tagging system should also be implemented, with quality inspectors checking the coal trucks. If a truck fails the quality check, the driver is required to pick out the stones. After studying and summarizing the workers' opinions, the party branch first implemented these methods in a youth coal mining team, and the output of low-quality coal was indeed reduced by half compared to the past. Later, the mine incorporated these methods into its regulations and systems.

Since the workers' proposed methods were widely implemented in July, the proportion of low-quality coal has decreased significantly. In the first half of this year, the output of low-quality coal accounted for 80% of the total output, exceeding the plan by one and a half times, while the output of raw coal only completed 73.34% of the plan. Now the output of low-quality coal has been reduced to 20%, and the output of raw coal has increased significantly, exceeding the plan every month. From July to October, the output of raw coal was more than 1,500 tons higher than the output in the first six months of the year.

    阜新新丘东露天矿党组织
　　充分依靠工人提高煤炭质量
    新华社阜新1日电　中共阜新煤矿新丘东露天矿组织依靠工人解决了煤炭质量低劣的问题。
    这个露天矿，今年开采的煤层是同一层层岩石混杂在一起的煤层，上半年开采出的煤，80％都是劣煤。因为煤的质量不好，一再受到各地用户的指责和罚款。
    为了解决这个问题，矿党支部书记找老工人和积极分子开了座谈会，跟他们研究解决办法，工人们提出了很多建议。工人们认为，首先要解决放炮问题，实行煤岩分采，岩石在上面先崩岩石，煤在上面先崩煤；在装车和运输的时候，都要动手往外拣石头；还要实行出车挂牌制，由质量检查员检查，谁的煤车不合格就让谁拣。党支部把工人的意见研究归纳以后，就首先在一个青年采煤队试行，劣煤产量果然比过去减少了一半。以后，矿里就把这些办法订到了规程制度里去。
    从7月份起，工人提出的办法普遍推行以后，劣煤比重显著下降。今年上半年劣煤产量占总产量的80％，超过计划一倍半，而原煤的产量却只完成计划73.34％。现在劣煤产量已经降低到20％，原煤产量显著增加，月月都超过了计划。从7月到10月的四个月中，原煤的产量比上半年六个月的产量还多一千五百多吨。
