Egypt's Ambassador to China, Ragab, stated at a press conference on the 7th that the British, French, and Israeli aggressors must compensate Egypt for the losses it suffered in the war of aggression against Egypt. This demand of the Egyptian people is entirely just and reasonable.

In this war of aggression against Egypt, Britain, France, and Israel caused enormous losses to the lives and property of the Egyptian people. The British, French, and Israeli aggressors launched a savage attack on Egypt when the Egyptian people were completely unprepared. They inhumanly bombed important Egyptian cities and transportation systems such as Cairo, Port Said, Ismailia, and Suez, massacred large numbers of innocent Egyptian people, and destroyed countless Egyptian properties. Many hospitals, schools, and mosques were damaged. In the battle to attack Port Said, the British and French aggressors blindly bombed and shelled the densely populated areas of Port Said with their naval and air forces, turning Port Said into a pile of rubble, causing thousands of deaths and injuries to peaceful residents. These barbaric war crimes of the British, French, and Israeli aggressors have aroused the indignation and condemnation of all righteous people in the world.

Now, under the heroic resistance of the Egyptian people and the strong opposition of the world, the British and French aggressors have been forced to announce their withdrawal from Egypt. However, this does not mean that the aggressors can be irresponsible for the war crimes they committed in Egypt, nor can they fail to compensate the Egyptian people for the losses they have suffered. The British, French, and Israeli aggressors must be held accountable for the crimes they committed in Egypt and must compensate the Egyptian people for their losses. If the British, French, and Israeli aggressors are allowed not to compensate the Egyptian people for their losses, it will be tantamount to condoning the aggressors to set fires. They will become dizzy with success, believing that they can launch wars of aggression at any time and in any place without being punished. Therefore, the legitimate demand of the Egyptian people for war reparations from the British, French, and Israeli aggressors should be met. This will not only provide the necessary compensation for the property of the Egyptian people destroyed by the aggressors, so that the lives of orphans and widows who lost their loved ones in the war can have some support, but also help to prevent new aggression, maintain justice, and defend peace.

The Chinese people sympathize with the war disasters suffered by the Egyptian people and hate the brutal behavior of the aggressors. The Chinese people fully support the just position of the Egyptian people in demanding compensation for losses from the aggressors and firmly believe that it will receive the same support from all peace-loving countries and people.

### 侵略者应该赔偿埃及的战争损失

　　侵略者应该赔偿埃及的战争损失
    埃及驻中国大使拉加卜7日在记者招待会上说，英国、法国和以色列侵略者，必须赔偿它们在侵略埃及战争中使埃及遭受的损失。埃及人民这一要求是完全正当和合理的。
    英法和以色列在这次侵略埃及的战争中，使埃及人民的生命财产遭受了巨大的损失。英法和以色列侵略者在埃及人民毫无戒备的情况下，对埃及发动野蛮的进攻。它们惨无人道地轰炸了开罗、塞得港、伊士美利亚、苏伊士等埃及的重要城市和交通系统，屠杀了大批埃及的无辜人民，毁灭了无数埃及的财产，许多医院、学校、寺院都遭到破坏。英法侵略者在进攻塞得港的战斗中，更以海空军对塞得港居民密集区进行盲目轰炸和炮击，使塞得港变成一片瓦砾，和平居民死伤达数千人。英法和以色列侵略者这种野蛮的战争罪行，激起了全世界一切正义人类的愤慨和谴责。
    现在，在埃及人民的英勇抗战和全世界的强烈反对下，英法侵略者已经被迫宣布从埃及撤军，但是，这并不等于说侵略者就可以对它们在埃及造成的战争罪行不负责任，就可以不赔偿埃及人民所遭受的损失。英法和以色列侵略者必须对它们在埃及犯下的罪行负责，必须赔偿埃及人民的损失。如果允许英法和以色列侵略者对埃及人民的损失不作赔偿，那就等于纵容侵略者放火，它们就会得意忘形，以为在任何时候任何地方发动侵略战争，都可以不受惩罚。因此，埃及人民要英法和以色列侵略者对埃及进行战争赔偿的正当要求，应该得到满足。这不仅可以使埃及人民被侵略者破坏的财产得到必要补偿，使埃及在战争中失去亲人的孤儿寡妇的生活有所依靠，而且将有助于制止新的侵略，维护正义，保卫和平。
    中国人民同情埃及人民所遭受的战争灾难，痛恨侵略者的残暴行为。中国人民完全支持埃及人民要求侵略者赔偿损失的正义立场，并且深信一定会得到一切爱好和平的国家和人民的同样的支持。
