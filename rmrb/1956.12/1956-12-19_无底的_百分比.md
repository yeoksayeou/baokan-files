Title: Bottomless "Percentages"

　　Percentages were originally a statistical method adopted to specifically illustrate problems. However, now some people have turned it into a self-deceiving numbers game. If you don’t believe it, please look at the deployment of the minor spring planting area made by the Baihua District Committee of the CCP Yibin County, Sichuan Province, not long ago! The Baihua District Committee required that the area sown with wheat in Xinglong Township should account for 36% of the total area, barley 32%, broad beans 14.5%, peas 20.43%, and rapeseed 10%. Adding up these percentages, the total is 112.93%. How can Xinglong Township complete such a requirement? Because there is no "foothold" for 12.93% of the crops, the farmers of Xinglong Township cannot plant them in the sky! I wonder if the Baihua District Committee calculated this before deploying the work?

　　Under the deployment of such "percentages," the situation of using percentages to "cope with the task" will inevitably occur. Let's take the Baihua District as an example: The director of the Yinglong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Baihua District reported to the township: "There is still a 30% shortage of fertilizer for the minor spring crops" ... a series of percentages. Someone on the spot asked: "How much fertilizer does your cooperative need in total, and how much do you have now?" The director blushed and replied: "To tell the truth, there is really no bottom."

　　It is said that the relevant leading organs are aware of this "really no bottom" situation. However, since the spring of this year, the Yibin County Committee Office of the CCP has consistently required each district to report figures. If the grassroots cadres cannot produce accurate figures, they can just estimate a percentage and "complete the task." May I ask, what good is such a "percentage" and such a "completion of the task" to our actual work?

### 无底的“百分比”

    无底的“百分比”
    百分比原是为了具体说明问题而采用的一种统计方法。但是，现在却有人将它变成一种自欺欺人的数字游戏。不信，请看不久以前中共四川宜宾县白花区委对兴隆乡小春播种面积的布置吧！白花区委要求兴隆乡播种的小麦占总面积的36％，大麦占32％，胡豆占14.5％，豌豆占20.43％，油菜占10％。把这几个百分数加起来一共是112.93％。这样的要求叫兴隆乡如何去完成呢？因为还有12.93％的农作物无“立足之地”，兴隆乡的农民不能把他们种在天上呵！这种情况，不知道白花区委在布置工作之前是否计算过？
    在这样一些“百分比”的布置下，用百分比来“应付差事”的情况也必然会出现。还以白花区的事为例：白花区应隆农业生产合作社主任向乡里汇报：“小春肥料还差30％”……一连串的百分比。当场有人问：“你们社共需多少肥料，现有多少？”主任脸红了，回答说：“说老实话，实在没有底。”
    据说，这种“实在没有底”的情况，有关领导机关是知道的。但是，从今年春天起，中共宜宾县委办公室就一直规定要各区汇报数字，基层干部拿不出准确数字，只要估计出一个百分比也就“完成了任务”。试问，要这样的“百分比”，这样的“完成任务”，对我们的实际工作有什么好处呢？
