Xinhua News Agency, Jiujiang, December 10th: In its year-end distribution, the Wushi Agricultural Cooperative in Dean County, Jiangxi Province, reasonably adjusted its production quotas, achieving "more rewards, fewer penalties," which greatly satisfied the members.

This year, the Wushi Cooperative's grain production increased by 31% compared to last year, and cash crops increased by 40%. However, because the original production quotas were set too high, eight out of the cooperative's nine production teams failed to meet their quotas, and even teams with increased production had to pay penalties. As a result, many members expressed that no one would dare to contract for production next year.

In response to this situation, the cooperative's leadership immediately went to each team to conduct investigations, ascertain actual yields, and compare them with previous years' yields. Based on the degree of increased production in most production teams, they re-determined the cooperative's production quotas for each crop. For example, the original quota for early rice was an average of 430 jin per mu. After investigation, it was found that the yield of most teams was around 390 jin, 9% less than the quota, but 11% more than last year; 390 jin was then set as the cooperative's standard quota for early rice. Then, using the determined cooperative quota for each crop as the standard, and considering the soil quality, cultivation difficulty, and water conservancy conditions of each team, the members democratically discussed and set different production yields for each team for each crop, making necessary adjustments.

After the adjustments, six teams received rewards for exceeding production, two teams met their quotas, and only the Second Production Team had to pay a penalty of more than 20%. The members further discussed the reasons for exceeding or failing to meet production targets, and summarized their experiences and lessons.

As a result of the adjustments, both teams with increased production and those with decreased production were very satisfied. The members said: This distribution is fair and reasonable.

    乌石农业社在年终分配中
    根据社员意见合理调整包产指标
    做到“多奖少罚”，大家都很满意
    新华社九江10日电　江西省德安县乌石农业社在年终分配中，合理地调整包产指标，做到了“多奖少罚”，社员们都很满意。
    今年乌石社的粮食产量比去年增加31％，经济作物增加40％。但是由于原来包产产量偏高，全社九个生产队就有八个没有达到包产指标，增产队也要赔产。因此，不少社员反映，明年谁也不敢包产了。
    针对这种情况，社的领导上立即分头深入各队进行调查，摸清实际产量，并和往年产量进行了对比，根据多数生产队的增产程度，重新确定了全社每项作物的包产指标。例如，原早稻包产指标每亩平均是四百三十斤，经过了解，大部分队的产量都在三百九十斤左右，比包产产量少9％，但比去年却增加了11％；就以三百九十斤做为全社早稻的包产标准。然后，再以确定的全社每项作物包产指标为标准，按照各队的土质好坏、耕作难易和水利等条件，由社员民主评议，订出各队每项作物的不同包产产量，重新做了必要的调整。
    调整后，全社有六个队超产受奖，两个队达到包产指标，只有第二生产队要赔产20％多。社员又进一步讨论了超产和赔产的原因，总结了经验教训。
    调整包产的结果，增产队和减产队都很满意。社员说：这样分配就公平合理了。
