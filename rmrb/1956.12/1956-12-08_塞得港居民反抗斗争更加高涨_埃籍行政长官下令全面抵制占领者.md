　　Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch from Port Said: As the Anglo-French invading forces are about to withdraw, the movement of Port Said residents resisting the invaders through various means is intensifying.

　　Shops, which have been closed since the invading forces landed, continue to refuse to open for business despite the occupation authorities' strict orders and other threatening and enticing tactics. The occupation authorities once ordered seven shops to open, but the shop owners refused to comply. The occupation forces arrested five of the seven shop owners and are still searching for the remaining two. The Egyptian administrator of Port Said has issued an order for a complete boycott, calling on merchants to disregard the occupation forces' orders to open their shops.

　　The Associated Press said that the British authorities' order to force shops to open has aroused the most intense wave of anti-British sentiment among Port Said residents since the cessation of hostilities.

　　塞得港居民反抗斗争更加高涨
  　埃籍行政长官下令全面抵制占领者
    新华社7日讯　塞得港消息：随着英法侵略军即将撤退，塞得港居民用各种方式抵制侵略者的运动正更加高涨。
    自从侵略军登陆以来就一直关着门的商店，不顾占领军当局的严厉命令和其他威胁利诱的手段，仍然拒绝开门营业。占领军当局曾经命令七家商店开门营业，但是店主们拒绝服从命令。占领军逮捕了七名店主中的五名，并且还在搜捕其余两名。埃及籍的塞得港行政长官已经下令进行全面的抵制，号召商人们不理会占领军要他们开门营业的命令。
    美联社说，英国当局迫使商店开门的这个命令激起了战斗停止以来塞得港居民最激烈的反英情绪的浪潮。
