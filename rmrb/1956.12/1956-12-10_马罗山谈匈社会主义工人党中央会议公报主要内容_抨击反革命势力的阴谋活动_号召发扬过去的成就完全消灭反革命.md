Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 9th: Máluòshān, a member of the Provisional Central Executive Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, held a press conference for foreign reporters at the Parliament Building on the afternoon of the 7th.

At the meeting, he said that the Provisional Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party held a meeting from December 2nd to 5th, at which the Hungarian incident was discussed deeply and seriously.

Máluòshān then introduced the main contents of the meeting communiqué to the reporters. He first introduced the four reasons analyzed in the communiqué that caused the Hungarian incident. He said that these four reasons were related to each other, influenced each other, and jointly led to the occurrence of the incident.

If one of these four reasons were missing, the October 23rd incident would not have occurred. Could such an event have been prevented in the summer? Yes, it could have. The Party's July Plenary Session was for this purpose, but after the July meeting, the international situation became tense and complicated, affecting the development of the Hungarian incident. If there were only domestic reasons, this incident would not have developed.

He said that the document passed at this meeting is not only a lesson for us, but also beneficial to all socialist countries. Obviously, the purpose of the counter-revolution was not to correct mistakes, but to eliminate the people's democratic system. However, before October 23rd, their purpose was more hidden. What is the nature of the armed rebellion that began on October 23rd? Was it a revolution or a counter-revolution? If we face reality squarely, it should be said that it was a counter-revolution, not a revolution.

He also said: Enemies at home and abroad will not openly engage in counter-revolutionary activities. If necessary, they can use the slogans of communism and democracy, but what they do is counter-revolutionary activity. Máluòshān then said: Now, the methods of counter-revolutionary activities have also changed. They have changed from armed struggle to political struggle. Now, it is impossible to launch a general strike. Recently, they have engaged in some activities, such as women's demonstrations, marches in front of the American embassy. They always want to engage in some activities at any time and under any circumstances, in order to prove that the Soviet army and the Kádár government have no way. To keep the Hungarian issue on the agenda of the United Nations for discussion.

He said that there have been very important changes now. There are Hungarian troops and police on the streets, and they have been maintaining order yesterday and the day before. The Soviet army is no longer responsible for maintaining order. Secondly, since the incident occurred, December 6th was the first time that real communists appeared on the streets. These show that the stage of fear has begun to pass. However, the enemy is very cunning, so there is still some tension, and there are still great difficulties ahead.

Máluòshān said that it should be affirmed that the Soviet army's two entries into Hungary were completely correct and were to protect the socialist system. He said that once he attended a meeting of party activists, where he explained the issue of the Soviet army and the government's request for Soviet assistance. He said at that meeting that in 1919, Horthy used international reactionary forces to restore the class rule of landlords and capitalists. We want to defend the achievements of socialism, and we also have the right to use socialist forces. We also have international solidarity, which is called proletarian internationalism. The workers accepted this explanation.

Next, Máluòshān talked about the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, saying that the Party conducts its activities in accordance with the principles of Marxism-Leninism, protecting and developing the healthy and good aspects of the communist movement over the past thirty-eight years. The Party's historical task is to lead and help the working people build socialism in Hungary, and to promote the achievements that have been made in the past twelve years despite the Rákosi-Gerő group. The Hungarian party is based on the alliance of workers and peasants, creatively applying Marxist-Leninist methods according to Hungarian characteristics, and will no longer mechanically copy the methods of other countries, but will pay attention to historical conditions and national characteristics. The Party is a unified party of the working class, and the unity formed by the working class in 1948 must continue to be promoted. The Party's leadership method is democratic centralism, making decisions on the basis of broad discussion, and every party member should abide by it. The Party will work with democratic and persuasive methods, rather than with command methods. The Party's current task is to make party members and the masses of the people bravely stand up, strengthen their forces, and completely eliminate the counter-revolution.

Máluòshān finally said that this meeting was very good, with full and free discussion. Some issues were repeatedly debated, and finally a consensus was reached on the main issues. The record of this meeting is meaningful historical material. The Party's leadership is unified. All difficult issues were discussed.

    马罗山谈匈社会主义工人党中央会议公报主要内容
    抨击反革命势力的阴谋活动
    号召发扬过去的成就完全消灭反革命
    新华社布达佩斯9日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党临时中央执行委员会委员马罗山7日下午在国会大厦举行了外国记者招待会。
    他在会上说，社会主义工人党临时中央委员会从12月2日到5日举行了会议，会上对匈牙利事件作了深刻严肃的讨论。
    马罗山接着将会议公报的主要内容向记者们作了介绍。他首先介绍了公报中所分析的引起匈牙利事件的四个原因。他说，这四个原因彼此相关，互相影响，共同导致了事件的发生。
    如果这四个原因缺少一个，也就不可能发生10月23日的事件。能不能在夏天阻止这样事件发生呢？是能够的。党的七月全会就是为了这一目的，但七月会议后，国际局势紧张复杂了，影响了匈牙利事件的发展。如果仅有国内原因是不会发展成这个事件的。
    他说，这次会议通过的文件不止是对我们的教训，对所有社会主义国家都是有益处的。很显然，反革命的目的不是为了纠正错误，而是想消灭人民民主制度。但在10月23日前，他们的目的较隐蔽。10月23日开始的武装暴动是什么性质呢？是革命还是反革命呢？如果正视现实，应该说是反革命，不是什么革命。
    他又说：不论国内国外的敌人，都不会公开地进行反革命活动，假如需要，他们可以用共产主义和民主的口号，但是他们做的却是反革命活动。马罗山接着说：现在，反革命活动的方法也改变了，他们已经从武装斗争改成用政治方式来进行斗争了。现在，要搞一个普遍性的罢工是不可能了。最近，他们搞了一些活动，如妇女的示威，在美国大使馆前的游行，他们总是想在任何时候和在任何情况下搞些活动，以此来证明苏军与卡达尔政府没有办法。使匈牙利问题始终保留在联合国讨论的日程上。
    他说，现在已有很重要的改变，街上已有匈牙利军队和警察，昨天和前天都是他们维持秩序，苏军已不负担维持秩序的责任。其次，从事件发生以来，12月6日是第一次在街上出现真正的共产党员。这些说明，恐惧的阶段开始过去了。然而敌人是很狡猾的，因此，还有一些紧张空气，还有很大的困难在后面。
    马罗山说，应该肯定苏军两次进军都完全正确，都是为了保护社会主义制度。他说，有一次他参加一个党员积极分子大会，在会上解释苏军的问题，关于政府请苏军帮助的问题。他在那个会上说，1919年霍尔蒂用国际的反动力量来恢复了地主资本家的阶级政权。我们要保卫社会主义的成果，我们也有权运用社会主义的力量。我们也有国际的团结，这就叫做无产阶级的国际主义。工人们接受了这个解释。
    接着，马罗山谈到匈牙利社会主义工人党的问题说，党依据马克思列宁主义的原则进行活动，保护和发展三十八年来共产主义运动中的健康的好的部分。党的历史任务是领导和帮助劳动人民在匈牙利建设社会主义，发扬过去十二年来虽然有拉科西—格罗集团但仍然获得了的成就。匈牙利党以工农联盟为基础，按照匈牙利的特点创造性地运用马克思列宁主义方法，不会再机械地抄袭其他国家的办法，而要注意历史条件和国家特点。党是工人阶级统一的政党，工人阶级在1948年所形成的统一要继续发扬。党的领导方法是民主集中制，在广泛讨论基础上作出决定，每一个党员都应遵守。党将用民主和说服的方法、而不是用命令方法来工作。党当前的任务是使党员和人民群众勇敢地站起来，增强力量，完全消灭反革命。
    马罗山最后说，这次会开得很好，充分自由讨论，有些问题经过反复争论，最后在主要问题取得了一致。这次会议的纪录是有意义的历史材料。党的领导是统一的。所有的困难问题都讨论了。
