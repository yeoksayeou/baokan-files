    Cases and Circles
    Ye Zhiqiu
    Chekhov wrote a story called "The Man in a Case," whose protagonist, in order to protect himself, constantly hid himself in a special case. But his fate was no better than ordinary people; on the contrary, it was worse.
    Now, some people also like to surround themselves with a special kind of case. This special case is the atmosphere that these people create around themselves, a very special atmosphere, which makes people (or rather, the masses) feel as if they are tightly wrapped in an invisible case, and they cannot help but develop an attitude of "respectful distance."
    And some people are even intoxicated by this "special case," as if they are not worthy enough to show their difference.
    For example, these people think that a row of "leader seats" should be reserved in the theater, so that they can enter the reserved seats at any time they please, as if they were in an uninhabited place, and let the audience, who are listening intently, look at them with sideways glances. They even feel that buying ordinary toothpaste in a department store and squeezing in with the masses is inappropriate, and they hope to set up a "leader" shopping place with special supplies for them.
    This strange phenomenon is not the only one. In a city in the Northwest, a special kind of dance was held. In the dance floor, there was a large circle, and at one end of the large circle was a small circle. The small circle was surrounded by sofas of various sizes. Ordinary cadres who participated in this dance could only dance in the large circle. Sitting in the small circle were the "leaders" of this organization and those who were invited. When the music started, a staff member led a group of female comrades to invite the "leaders" sitting in the small circle to dance. Of course, they only danced in this small circle. After the dance, the female companions left the small circle. Except for them, this small circle was strictly forbidden to non-"leaders."
    These people who are content to sit in the small circle have forgotten that they once shared weal and woe with the broad masses of the people and came from the masses. Today, they are only entrusted with responsible positions because of the people's trust, in order to do things for the people. They surround themselves with layers of dust-covered cases, in order to isolate themselves from the masses, in order to show that they are different from the masses, and in order to flaunt their "status" in front of the masses. These people are unwilling to be with the masses even when dancing and watching plays. Can they really wholeheartedly do things for the people?
    Even if the "case" of the 20th century is more special, it will not have a different fate from the "case" in Chekhov's 19th-century writing. Those who are intoxicated with the "case," open your eyes, because the masses will throw you out of our social life!

    套子和圈圈
    叶知秋
    契呵夫写过一篇小说叫做“套子里的人”，它的主人公为了加意地保护自己，时刻地把自己躲藏在一种特殊的套子里。但是他的命运却并不比普通人好，相反的，却更糟。
    现在，有些人也很喜欢把自己用一种特殊的套子包围起来。这种特殊的套子，就是这些人在自己的周围渲染着一种气氛，一种很特殊的气氛，使人（或者说是群众）看上去就觉得被一种无形的套子紧紧地包裹起来，而不得不产生了一种“敬而远之”的情绪。
    而有些人竟自陶醉在这种“特殊的套子”里面，好像不如此不足以显示自己的与众不同。
    例如，这些人觉得戏院里应该保留一排“首长席”，在自己任何高兴的时候，可以如入无人之境地走进那保留的席次里去，让那些屏息静听的观众们个个侧目注视。他们连买一支普通的牙膏也觉得在百货公司和群众挤在一起是不相称的，而希望为他们设置一种具有特殊供应的“首长”购物处。
    这种怪现象并不是只有一个。在西北某一个城市里，举行过一种具有特殊形式的舞会，舞池里有一个大圈圈，大圈圈的一端有一个小圈圈，小圈圈是用大大小小的沙发围起来的。参加这个舞会的普通干部只能在大圈圈里跳，小圈圈里坐着的是这个机关里的和邀请来的“首长”，音乐响起来的时候，有一位工作人员引着一批女同志们来邀请坐在小圈圈里的“首长”们起舞。当然，他们也只在这个小圈圈里舞。舞罢，女伴退出小圈圈。除她们以外，这个小圈圈是严禁非“首长”入内的。
    这批安于坐在小圈圈里的人们，他们已经忘记自己是曾经和广大人民群众共过患难，是从群众中间来的，他们今天只是由于人民的信任，担任了负责的职务，为的是替人民办事情。他们用一层一层沾满了灰尘的套子把自己包围起来，为的是和群众隔离开来，为的是显示自己和群众不同，为的是要在群众面前夸耀自己的“地位”。这种人连跳舞、看戏都不愿意和群众在一起，他们真能全心全意地为人民办事情么？
    二十世纪的“套子”即使再特殊，也不会比十九世纪契呵夫笔下的“套子”有什么不同的命运。陶醉在“套子里”的人们，把眼睛睁开来吧，因为群众要把你从我们的社会生活里抛出去的！
