　　Mine Explosion-Proof Safety Signal Equipment
    This newspaper reports that the employees of the Tianjin Joint Public-Private New An Electric Motor Factory have recently successfully trial-produced twelve types of mine explosion-proof safety signal equipment. This provides material conditions for safe coal mine production.
    In the past, our country could not produce these equipment. At the beginning of 1955, the New An Electric Motor Factory accepted the trial production task from the Ministry of Coal Industry. At that time, there were no drawings, so they surveyed and mapped the drawings on the spot; lacking jigs, fixtures and molds, they tried to manufacture them. In particular, although these equipment are small in size, the technical performance requirements such as explosion-proof, moisture-proof, pressure-resistant, and insulation are very strict. For example, the mouth joint surface of the explosion-proof shell requires a level six precision, and any gap on the joint surface must not exceed 0.2 mm; the insulation resistance must reach 2.5 million ohms when the relative humidity is 51-70% to prevent the invasion of underground humidity. Thanks to the active research of the factory's leadership, technical personnel and employees, they finally trial-produced such precise explosion-proof safety signal equipment.
    At present, the New An Electric Motor Factory is also planning to continue the trial production of nearly a hundred new varieties, and further expand production to supply the needs of the coal industry.

　　矿井防爆安全信号设备
    本报讯　天津市公私合营新安电机厂职工在最近试制成功了十二种矿井防爆安全信号设备。这就给煤矿安全生产提供了物质条件。
    这些设备，过去我国不能生产。1955年初，新安电机厂接受了煤炭工业部的试制任务。当时没有图纸，他们就实地测绘图样；缺乏工卡模具，就想办法制造；特别是这些设备体积虽小，但是防爆、防潮、耐压、绝缘等技术性能要求甚严，例如防爆外壳对口接缝面，要求达到六级精度，接缝面的任何空隙不得超过零点二公厘；绝缘电阻在相对湿度为五十一七十时，要达到二点五百万欧姆，才能防止井下潮湿的侵袭。由于厂的领导方面、技术人员和职工的积极钻研，终于试制成这样精密的防爆安全信号设备。
    目前，新安电机厂还在计划继续进行近百种的新品种的试制，进一步扩大生产，以供应煤炭工业的需要。
