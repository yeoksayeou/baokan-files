　　Some associations are quite peculiar and thought-provoking.

　　When I was a child, we planted some flowers and plants in the backyard. In spring, after the rains in Jiangnan, the fresh atmosphere in the yard was really lovely. At this time, on the flower branches or moss that had been bathed in the spring rain, there was a little creature with a small house on its back, timidly stretching out two tentacles to explore the way forward, inching along step by step. Because I thought it was useless, carrying a house with it when it went out, and shrinking back at the slightest risk, I always liked to tease it with sticks and branches, making it feel extraordinarily distressed and confused, while I was quite proud of myself.

　　When I grew up, I wandered around in the old society. This bit of childish innocence and fun, like a lost dream, had long been gone. But whenever I wandered to a new place, unfamiliar with the people and the place, and unable to find a place to eat and stay, I would always think of the snails in my old garden. At this time, I no longer had the contempt of the past, but was very envious. I felt that if I could carry a small house on my back, wouldn't I be able to rest in the bleak and rainy streets? And my confusion and resentment towards the invisible whip that was playing with me, held in the hands of the privileged, increased even more.

　　After liberation, I joined the revolutionary work, lived in a beautiful building, and had a warm home. My body and mind had some sense of belonging, and I should have been satisfied and grateful. However, beyond the basic needs of food and clothing, some dissatisfaction, some unwarranted desire to pursue even more comfort, would often assail my heart. When my head got hot, blinded by profit, I would feel aggrieved, feel that the revolution should have given me more than just this little bit, and I didn't think about how much work I had done for the people, so I was full of complaints, forgetting the bleak and rainy streets with nowhere to go when I was wandering in the past, forgetting how much the people had given me, forgetting that I was living in a comfortable building. But when the heat in my head subsided, and I put myself in other people's shoes, I couldn't help but shudder and think of snails, feeling how small and insignificant this humble emotion, which only thought of oneself and only planned for oneself, was, how much like a bug!

　　In recent days, reading the "People's Daily," I read two news items about houses. I don't know why, but the little snail in my old garden was inching along in front of my eyes again.

　　One was that the leaders of Beijing University of Political Science and Law took the lead in vacating many houses, solving the difficulty of not having enough houses due to the sudden increase in the number of students. It is truly touching that leaders such as the vice president, the Party committee secretary, and the director of general affairs can resist being attached to their warm "snail dwellings" and move to the office to live, so that the students can all have their places and study with peace of mind. The People's Daily published an editorial to commend them, which was entirely timely and necessary.

　　The other was that several section chiefs of the Propaganda Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee forcibly occupied two small buildings in the Ge Ling foothills of West Lake, which the provincial governor had personally approved for the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, while leaving their own dormitories empty. Although the leading cadres of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles ran around, wrote official documents, and paid visits, they still refused to move out. The Federation of Literary and Art Circles had no choice but to move into the few vacant rooms left by the section chiefs, which offended them, who said that they were "acting recklessly," "lacking principles," and "affecting the unity of the organization," and so on. Under this pressure, the Federation of Literary and Art Circles had to work in the toilets and corridors. Reading this, although I was also very indignant, I don't know why, but a pitiful, tiny little snail, carrying a house on its back, appeared in front of my eyes. Associating those who leaned on the window rails, admiring the sunset over Ge Ling, or those who were unreasonable, with snails. Although this is somewhat disrespectful and somewhat incongruous, as I said before, some associations are quite peculiar and thought-provoking!

    有些联想是很奇特而引人深思的。
    小时候，我家后院种了些花草。春天，江南阵雨过后，院子里那一派清新气象，实在逗人喜爱。这时，沐过春雨的花枝或青苔上，有一种背着个小房子，胆怯地伸着两只触角在前面探路的小东西，在一步步地蠕动着。因为觉得它没出息，出门还背着个房子，一遇风险就缩了进去，所以总爱拿棍子枝子逗弄它，使它感到异常的苦恼和困惑，而自己则颇为得意。
    大了，在旧社会到处流浪，这一分童心和乐趣，像个遗落的梦，早已失去。但每当流浪到一个新地方，人地两疏，找不到食宿的处所时，却总要想起故园的蜗牛来。这时，已无当年鄙薄之意，而是十分羡慕了。觉着自己的背上要是也驮个小房子，不也可以在风雨凄迷的街头，安息下来吗？而对于那根播弄着我的、掌握在特权者手里而又看不见的无形的鞭子，就更增加一分困惑和愤恨。
    解放后，参加革命工作，住在漂亮的楼房里，有了个温暖的家，身心是会有些归宿，本该合十念佛，十分满足了。可是，在温饱之余，某种不满，某种想追求更安逸的不该有的欲念，却时时袭上心来。脑门子一热，利令神昏，就觉得委屈，觉得革命给自己的不该只是这一点点，而没想到自己给人民做了多少工作，于是也便牢骚满腹，忘了过去流浪时风雨凄迷无处归宿的街头，忘了人民给自己的已很丰优，忘了自己是住在舒适的楼房里了。但脑门子的热一退，设身处地想想，不禁竦然地想起蜗牛来，觉得这种只想到自己，只为个人打算的卑微感情，是多么渺小，多么像只虫豸啊！
    近几日读“人民日报”，读到了二则关于房子的消息，不知怎样，故园里的小蜗牛，又一步步地在眼前蠕动着。
    一则是：北京政法学院领导人员带头，腾出好些房子，解决了因学生人数骤增，房子不够的困难。对于像副院长、党委书记、总务主任等领导同志，能不贪恋于温暖的“蜗居”，搬到办公室去住，让学生们能各得其所，安心学习，这种克己利人，艰苦朴素的高风美德，实在令人感动。人民日报发表社论加以表扬，完全是适时和必要的。
    另一则是：中共浙江省委宣传部的几位处长，把省长亲自批给省文联的在里西湖葛岭山麓的两幢小楼房，强加霸占，而让自己的宿舍空着。尽管文联的领导干部东跑西奔，写公文、登门拜访，还是不肯搬出，文联没法，只好搬到处长们住剩下的几间空房里去，这可就触犯了他们，说人家是“胡来”，“没有原则性”，“影响机关团结”等等。文联在这种逼迫下，只好在厕所旁、走廊里办公。读到这里，我虽然也十分愤慨；但不知怎的，在我眼前却出现了一只可怜的、渺小的、驮着个房子出门的小蜗牛来。把那些倚着窗栏、欣赏葛岭夕阳的，或蛮不讲理的人，和蜗牛联想在一起。这虽然有些不恭，也有些不伦不类。但我前面说过，有些联想，是很奇特而引人深思的！
