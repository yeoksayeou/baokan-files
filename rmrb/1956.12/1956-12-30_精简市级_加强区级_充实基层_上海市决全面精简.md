Streamline the Municipal Level, Strengthen the District Level, Replenish the Grassroots Level
Shanghai Decides on Comprehensive Streamlining

(Reported by Wenhui Bao) Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, gave an account at a cadre meeting of 12,000 people on the 27th: Currently, the agencies under the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee employ more than 50,000 people. If this is reduced by 20%-25%, approximately 12,000 people can be streamlined.

The general situation of state organs in Shanghai is that the institutions are large and there are many levels. In 1952, there were only 21 units under the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee. Due to the development of construction and the scientific division of labor in various tasks, this has increased to 66 this year, with a 19.2% increase in personnel. The growth of state-owned enterprise systems and specialized company agencies and personnel is also significant; the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the Electrical and Mechanical Company originally had only 290 people, but it has now suddenly increased to 1,390. In the process of development, there are also many unreasonable phenomena. There are few people managing business and many people managing administrative affairs. The ratio of administrative staff to business staff at the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China is one to one. Many agencies have their own batches of refrigeration workers, heating workers, carpenters, electricians, repairmen, maintenance workers, and other various technicians and service personnel.

In his report, Cao Diqiu pointed out the consequences of the above situation. He said: Many agencies are overstaffed, and some cadres spend their work hours learning Russian, reading the Book of Poetry, practicing Tai Chi, and strolling on the streets. According to a survey, a unit with 500 employees actually only needs 170 people. The average working time per person per day in the Planning Department of the No. 1 Bureau of Heavy Industry is less than four hours. The work of the agencies is weak and lacks combat effectiveness, and the role of organizations at all levels cannot be fully exerted. Personnel from higher-level agencies cannot go down (because there are many agency affairs), cannot sit still (because there are many requests for instructions by phone), and cannot come up (because there are many problems that need to be solved at the grassroots level after they go down). More seriously, it fosters bureaucracy and red tape in the agencies. On the other hand, large agencies and redundant personnel greatly increase state expenditures, occupy a lot of housing, and waste the state's financial and material resources. Therefore, Cao Diqiu believes that the key to carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement in the agencies lies in: streamlining the institutions.

Cao Diqiu requested that 20%-25% of the staff be streamlined in all agencies throughout the city. The principles of streamlining are: streamline the municipal level, strengthen the district level, and replenish the grassroots level; reduce non-business personnel and non-production personnel; reduce levels, with general units implementing a two-level system; clarify the division of labor and delineate responsibilities. In streamlining, it is necessary to pay attention to the proper arrangement of personnel who are removed from the establishment.

    精简市级　加强区级　充实基层
    上海市决全面精简
    本报讯　据文汇报消息：中共上海市委书记处书记、上海市副市长曹荻秋27日在一万二千人的干部大会上算了一笔账：目前市人民委员会所属机关工作人员五万多人，如减少20％—25％，即可精简一万二千人左右。
    上海市国家机关的总情况是机构庞大，层次多。市人民委员会所属单位在1952年只有二十一个，由于建设事业的发展和各项工作的科学分工，到今年已增加到六十六个，人数增加了19.2％。国营企业系统及专业公司机关单位和人数的增长也很大；交电公司上海采购供应站原来只有二百九十人，现在骤增到一千三百九十人。在发展中，也存在着许多不合理现象。管业务的人少，管行政事务的人多。中国人民银行上海分行的行政人员与业务人员的比例为一比一。不少机关都各拥有一批冷气工、热气工、木工、电工、修理工、保养工等名目繁多的技工和勤杂人员。
    曹荻秋在报告中指出了上述情况所产生的后果，他说：不少机关人浮于事，有的干部在工作时间学俄文、读诗经、打太极拳、逛马路。据调查，有一个五百个工作人员的单位实际上只要一百七十人就够了。重工业一局计划处平均每人每天的工作时间不到四小时。机关工作软弱无力，缺乏战斗性，各级组织的作用也不能充分发挥。上级机关人员下不去（机关事务多）、坐不稳（请示电话多）、上不来（下去以后基层要解决的问题多）。更严重的是助长了机关中的官僚主义和文牍主义。另一方面，机关庞大，人员冗多，大大增加了国家的开支，占用了很多用屋，浪费了国家的财力、物力。因此，曹荻秋认为，在机关中开展增产节约运动的关键是在于：精简机构。
    曹荻秋要求在全市各机关中精简20％—25％的工作人员。精简的原则是：精简市级，加强区级，充实基层；减少非业务人员和非生产人员；减少层次，一般单位实行二级制；明确分工，划清职责。在精简时，必须注意对编余人员的妥善安排。
