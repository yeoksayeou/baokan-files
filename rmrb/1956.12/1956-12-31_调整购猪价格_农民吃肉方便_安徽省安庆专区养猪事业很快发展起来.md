(Reported by our newspaper) By the end of November, farmers in Anqing Special District, Anhui Province, had increased their hog raising by 210,000 head. Including the hogs previously raised, the entire district has reached an average of more than one hog per two farming households.

Anqing Special District adopted many methods to encourage farmers to raise hogs in the development of hog production. The first was to correct the phenomenon of suppressing grades and prices and to adjust hog prices. In the three months from September to November, farmers in this special district increased their income by more than 40,000 yuan due to the adjustment of hog prices. Secondly, in addition to completing the state's hog purchase tasks, agricultural cooperatives could also slaughter surplus hogs themselves. In this way, it became much easier for farmers to eat meat and oil themselves than before, which stimulated their enthusiasm for raising hogs. In addition, the agricultural cooperatives adopted the method of "cooperative breeding, private raising with public assistance" to help cooperative members solve the problem of the source of pigs and the funding for raising pigs, which also played a significant role in the development of hog production.

Now, this special district has formulated a preliminary hog raising plan, requiring an average of 1.5 hogs per household from January to May 1957, and achieving two hogs per household by the end of 1957.

    调整购猪价格　农民吃肉方便
    安徽省安庆专区养猪事业很快发展起来
    本报讯　到11月底为止，安徽省安庆专区的广大农民，已增养生猪二十一万头：连同以前饲养的生猪，全区已达到每两户农民平均有一头多生猪。
    安庆专区在发展生猪生产方面，曾采取了许多鼓励农民养猪的办法。首先是纠正了压级压价的现象，对猪的价格进行了调整。这个专区从9月到11月的三个月中，农民因为猪价的调整，增加收入达四万多元。其次，农业社除完成国家生猪订购任务以外，对于多余的生猪还可以自己宰杀。这样，农民自己吃肉吃油就比以前方便多了，从而刺激了农民的养猪积极性。此外，农业社采取“社繁自养，私养公助”的办法，帮助社员解决猪的来源和养猪的经费问题，对发展生猪生产，也起了很大作用。
    现在，这个专区已拟订了一个初步的养猪计划，要求在1957年1月到5月，每户平均养猪一头半，到1957年底，每户作到养猪两头。
