Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 16th: The following is the full text of the accusation made today by Gu Huizhen, an assistant nurse at the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trade Union Federation's Tsuen Wan Workers' Clinic, at the Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City People's Comfort Meeting for Compatriots Victimized in the Kowloon Riot:

Dear Compatriots!

I am Gu Huizhen, an assistant nurse at the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trade Union Federation's Tsuen Wan Workers' Clinic. During the Kowloon riot, I was repeatedly raped by inhuman Kuomintang special agents. Today, I want to accuse the Kuomintang special agents of their bestial behavior in front of my relatives in the motherland!

After our Workers' Clinic was attacked by special agents on the night of October 11th, I was grabbed on the upper floor by a thug like a mad dog. I glared at him angrily at the time and struggled desperately. Because my co-workers were present at the time, this thug had no choice but to let go. But later, when I was forced downstairs, those thugs grabbed me and tried to tear off my clothes. At that time, my colleague Yang Guanfu saw this situation. He scolded those thugs and desperately pulled me out of their hands, using his body to protect me. When the thugs saw Yang Guanfu protecting me, they pushed us both out of the clinic. Some of the thugs beat Yang Guanfu, and some forcibly tore off my clothes. I struggled with the thugs with all my strength. Although Yang Guanfu was injured at this time, he still struggled to pull me back from the thugs again, and snatched my torn clothes to put on me, telling me to leave quickly. But at this time, I could no longer escape. My hair was pulled by the thugs, my feet were pulled by the thugs, and the clothes in my hand were snatched away by the thugs again. The thugs tore me away from Yang Guanfu and dragged Yang Guanfu elsewhere to continue beating him. Yang Guanfu was later beaten so severely that he died. Those thugs pressed me to the ground, tore off my underwear, and grabbed my upper body like beasts. Some thugs kicked me all over my body, and a group of thugs came to rape me in turn. I was pressed to the ground by the thugs and could not resist. I cried for help. But at that time, my colleagues were also being beaten or insulted by the thugs, and no one could come to save me. When I later struggled to run away, the second group of thugs rushed over and pressed me down again to rape me in turn. When I struggled to escape again, I was chased and raped for the third time in the street by another group of thugs in front of the Kam Wah Bakery. After the thugs raped me, they wanted to parade me naked through the streets. Later, because their leader blew a whistle and told them to attack other places, they let go of me, and I took the opportunity to escape. After being raped and beaten, my lower body was swollen, and my left eye, upper chest, and left pelvis were bruised and black. I wish I could tear those vicious and shameless Kuomintang special agents into pieces and devour them alive!

I work in medical care, and this work is the most sacred. Why did the Kuomintang special agents insult and hurt me so brutally? Afterwards, the Kuomintang special agents thought I was dead and denied that the rape had happened, but I just won't die, I can't die, I'm still alive. As long as I have a breath left, I will take revenge!

I demand that the Hong Kong British authorities severely punish the Kuomintang special agent murderers who created this riot! Such atrocities must not be allowed to happen again in the future!

    “只要还有一口气我就要报仇”
    荃湾工人医疗所助理护士古惠贞的控诉词
    新华社广州16日电　香港“港九工会联合会荃湾工人医疗所”助理护士古惠贞，今天在广东省、广州市各界人民慰问九龙暴乱事件受害同胞大会上的控诉词，全文如下：
    亲爱的同胞们！
    我是港九工会联合会荃湾工人医疗所的助理护士古惠贞，在九龙暴乱事件中，没有人性的国民党特务分子曾轮流强奸了我。今天，我要在祖国的亲人面前，控诉国民党特务分子的禽兽行为！
    我们工人医疗所在10月11日晚上被特务分子攻进来以后，我在楼上就被一个暴徒像疯狗一样地抱起来，我当时愤怒地用眼瞪着他，拚命挣扎。由于当时同所的工友都在场，这个暴徒才不得不把手松开。但后来我被迫下到楼下时，那些暴徒又揪着我要撕去我身上的衣服。当时我们所的同事杨观福看到了这情形，他一面痛骂那些暴徒，一面奋不顾身把我从暴徒手里拉出来，并且用他的身体掩护着我。暴徒看到杨观福掩护我，便把我们一起推出医疗所外面。暴徒一部分殴打杨观福，一部分强撕去我的衣服，我拚尽全力跟暴徒挣扎。杨观福这时候虽然被打伤了，但他还挣扎着从暴徒手中再一次把我拉回来，同时抢回我的破衣服给我披上，叫我快走。但这时候我已经走不脱了。我的头发被暴徒扯着，我的脚被暴徒拉着，我手里的衣服再被暴徒夺走了。暴徒把我从杨观福身边扯开来，又拉杨观福去别处继续毒打，杨观福后来就被打到重伤不治而死了。那些暴徒把我按倒在地上，并且把我的底裤也撕脱掉，像野兽一样向我的上身乱抓，有些暴徒用脚在我的身上乱踢，一批暴徒就来轮奸我。我被暴徒压着在地上没法反抗，我叫救命。但当时同事们都一样被暴徒毒打或侮辱，没有人能来救我了。当我后来挣脱想跑的时候，第二批暴徒又踊过来再把我按倒轮流强奸。当我再次挣扎开来逃走的时候，跑不多远，在锦华饼家的门口，又被另一批暴徒追上，当着大街第三次把我轮奸。暴徒把我轮奸后，还要押我裸体游行。后来因为他们的头子吹哨子叫他们去攻别的地方，他们松了手，我才乘机跑脱了。我被轮奸和毒打后，下阴肿了，左眼、上胸、左盘骨都瘀黑。我恨不得把那些狠毒无耻的国民党特务分子碎尸万段，生吞活剥！
    我是做医务工作的，这工作是最神圣的。国民党特务分子为什么这样残暴的污辱我、伤害我？事后，国民党特务分子还以为我死了，不承认有强奸这事，但是我偏不死，我死不了，我还活着。只要我还有一口气，我就要报仇！
    我要求香港英国当局一定要严惩制造这次暴乱的国民党特务凶手！今后不许再有这样的暴行重演！
