　　Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 3rd -- After strengthening policy propaganda and market management, Fuzhou City quickly reversed the situation of a large amount of unified purchase materials flowing into free markets.
    In early November, the Party and government leading organs of Fuzhou City organized a work team of more than 100 people to widely publicize the state's policies on opening free markets to residents. Fuzhou City also sent people to the inns in nearby Putian and Fuqing counties to repeatedly publicize to farmers who came to these places to sell things that they must first complete the state's unified purchase plan and implement purchase contracts, and persuaded farmers who did not have certificates of completion of the state plan to sell unified purchase materials to the state. The Party and government leading organs in the suburbs specially convened a meeting of Party branch secretaries and township heads to explain policies and extensively educate agricultural cooperatives and farmers. At the same time, state-owned aquatic products, food, and sundry goods companies actively improved their purchasing operations and organized hundreds of small traders and vendors to purchase goods in the production areas.
    At present, in the free markets of Fuzhou, the amount of unified purchase and unified acquisition materials on the market has been greatly reduced, and the amount of openable materials such as hairy chickens, potatoes, and sweet potato flour on the market is more than in the past, and prices are also stable. The entire free market has overcome the initial chaotic phenomenon.

　  福州市加强政策宣传和市场管理后
　　流入自由市场的统购物资大大减少
    新华社福州3日电　福州市加强政策宣传和市场管理后，迅速扭转了统购物资大量流入自由市场的状况。
    福州市党政领导机关在11月上旬，组织了一百多人的工作队，向居民广泛宣传国家开辟自由市场的各项政策。福州市还派人到附近的莆田、福清县的客栈里，向到这些地方出卖东西的农民反复宣传必须首先完成国家的统购计划，执行收购合同等道理，劝导没有拿到完成国家计划证明文件的农民，把统购物资卖给国家。郊区的党政领导机关专门召开了党支部书记和乡长会议，交代政策，并且广泛向农业社和农民进行教育。与此同时，国营水产、食品、杂用杂货等公司积极改进收购业务，组织了几百个小商小贩到产地收购。
    目前，在福州的自由市场上，统购和统一收购的物资的上市量已大大减少，可以开放的物资如毛鸡、马铃薯、番薯粉等上市量都比过去多，价格也平稳。整个自由市场已克服了初期的混乱现象。
