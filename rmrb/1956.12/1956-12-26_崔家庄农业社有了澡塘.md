    Cuijiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative Has a Bathhouse
    Cuijiazhuang Village, Dahuangzhuang Township, Xiangyuan County, Shanxi Province, is a small village of seventy to eighty households. In the past, the farmers in this village had not only never been to a bathhouse, but few even knew what a bathhouse looked like.
    Last year, this village established an advanced cooperative. With the development of production, the members urgently requested to improve their living conditions in all aspects and hoped that the cooperative would build a very economical bathhouse.
    The cooperative management committee studied the opinions of the members and decided to build a bathhouse based on the principles of voluntary labor and investment. As a result, each member spent only a few jiao and used less than six days to build a spacious and practical bathhouse.
    After the bathhouse was built, the cooperative stipulated the dates for men and women to bathe. Whenever there was a break at noon or in the evening, more than a dozen members would happily enter the bathhouse to take a bath. When old man Chen Genxi took his first bath, he said happily, "If it weren't for the cooperative, I wouldn't have been able to take a bath in this lifetime."

    崔家庄农业社有了澡塘
    山西襄垣县大黄庄乡崔家庄村，是一个七、八十户人家的小村庄。在过去，这村的农民不但没有进澡塘洗过澡，就连澡塘是个什么样也很少有人知道。
    去年，这个村办起了高级社，随着生产的发展，社员们迫切地要求从各方面改善生活条件，希望社里修建一个十分经济的洗澡塘。
    社管理委员会研究了社员们的意见，决定在自愿投工、投资的原则下，修建一个洗澡塘。结果，每个社员只花了几角钱，用了还不到六天的时间，就建成了一个宽大、适用的洗澡塘。
    澡塘建成后，社里规定了男女洗澡的日期。每逢中午或晚上休息的时候，总有十几个社员愉快地进入澡塘洗澡。陈根喜老汉第一次洗澡的时候高兴地说：“要不是办了合作社，这辈子就别想洗个澡。”
