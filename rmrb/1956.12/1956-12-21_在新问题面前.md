    Facing New Problems
    By our reporter Cao Baoming
    In June, an unexpected event occurred on the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction site. The steel beams of the bridge had been riveted for two months, but no one knew how to rivet them properly. The Yangtze River Bridge steel beams required close to a million rivets, and the quality of the riveting would decisively affect the lifespan of the bridge's steel beams. Experts consulted many reference books, but the information in the books couldn't solve the problem. Clearly, this was a new problem.
    The riveting of the Yangtze River Bridge steel beam erection project began in July. After only a few days, a newly arrived riveting expert, Tsilkov, detected substandard issues like "burrs" and "eccentricity" in the rivets. Why couldn't they rivet properly? Luo Qibin, the chief engineer in charge of steel beam riveting, consulted expert Tsilkov. The expert directly told him, "I haven't slept well for five days because of this, and I still haven't figured out why they can't rivet properly." Engineer Luo then consulted with the workers. Many workers said, "The rivet furnace doesn't burn well, and the rivet gun doesn't work well!" Engineer Luo understood the riveters' temperament; whenever problems arose in their work, they would always complain about the tools. He couldn't find the cause.
    Logically speaking, the rivet gun operators for the bridge's steel beams were all grade-six technicians, and their technical level wasn't low. Their rivet furnaces had been modified eight times by Soviet experts, and their rivet guns were selected from products from five different countries; the equipment conditions were the best. ...
    One afternoon, expert Tsilkov told Engineer Luo: "Today, this section of steel beam diagonal bracing was assembled well, and the screws were tightened properly. Let's try tonight to see if we can rivet it well." Engineer Luo, seeing that the expert hadn't slept well for five days, told the expert to go back and rest, and that he would do the experiment. After dinner, he went to consult with the workers again. He asked an old riveter named Chen, "You used to rivet so well, why can't you rivet well this time?" To his surprise, Old Chen replied, "I haven't riveted in two years." He asked several other workers, and some said, "I haven't riveted in four years." Others said, "I've never even seen such long rivets." This made him realize something: "Perhaps the problem lies in the lack of practice and poor skills." But he wasn't sure and wanted to find a more skilled riveter to experiment. Coincidentally, a worker recommended him, "Song Dazhen from our mechanical leasing station is a grade-seven worker, with excellent skills and a lot of experience." Engineer Luo immediately wrote a letter, asking him to come and experiment. It was already ten o'clock at night, and Song Dazhen, upon seeing the letter, put on his clothes and rushed to the construction site.
    Several leaders of the riveting team accompanied rivet gun operator Song Dazhen to experiment until two o'clock in the morning. They riveted twenty-eight rivets in three groups, with no "burrs" and no "eccentricity." Every rivet head was tightly attached to the steel plate. The next day, when expert Tsilkov saw these rivets, he said happily, "Isn't this riveted very well? Rivet like this!"
    The riveting team immediately promoted Song Dazhen's experience and also summarized and promoted the operating experiences of rivet heating workers Liu Maolin and Li Changsheng. The problems of "burrs," "eccentricity," and rivet appearance quality were solved, and the progress of the steel beam erection project also accelerated. In just over ten days, it spanned the first pier and erected the first span. At this time, Song Dazhen was pondering another question: "The bridge's rivets are so long, from both ends, it looks like the rivet fills the eye hole, but I don't know if it fills the middle?" He used a cold rivet to try to plug the eye hole. The result was that the cold rivet wobbled in the eye hole, proving that the gap in the eye hole was wide. He then measured it with calipers and found that the diameter of the eye hole was 26.6 millimeters, while the rivet shaft was only 24.7 millimeters, a difference of 1.9 millimeters. He went to ask Engineer Luo: "If the middle section of the rivet cannot fill the eye hole, is that considered poor quality?"
    This sudden question stumped Engineer Luo. In the past, when riveting steel beams, they only used a small hammer to tap, and if it didn't feel numb or move, it was considered qualified. Now, the Yangtze River Bridge first used a large hammer and then a small hammer, and the inspection was much stricter than before, but they hadn't paid attention to whether the rivet filled the eye hole. He didn't expect that Song Dazhen, this thoughtful worker, would raise such a question. Engineer Luo went back to check the books, read them repeatedly, but couldn't find a clear answer. At this time, the task of steel beam splicing was urgent, so he put the matter aside.
    More than ten days later, Song Dazhen raised this question to the construction section of the bureau and asked, "Does this have an impact on quality?" Engineer Ping Guanghan, who was responsible for quality inspection, immediately asked upon hearing this, "How many of these rivets that don't fill are there?" "Most of them are like this." At this time, Engineer Ping became anxious. Because it was already September, the steel beams had been riveted for two months, and such a problem had emerged. Engineer Ping chipped off dozens of rivets from the steel beams for inspection and found that more than 73% of the rivets did not fill the eye hole.
    This new discovery immediately shook the bridge construction site!
    The Engineering Bureau immediately issued an order: "Before the quality problem of the rivets is resolved, the steel beam splicing will stop." At this time, Engineer Luo led Song Dazhen to find expert Grigoriev. Expert Grigoriev measured the diameter of the rivet shaft, flipped through the Soviet technical regulations, and thought for a while, saying, "The Soviet standard is also like this, just keep riveting!" Then he raised several issues to pay attention to in the operation. The two of them came back and discussed conducting experiments according to the expert's suggestions. Engineer Luo was also afraid that the operation wouldn't meet the requirements, so he also found expert Qiuliayev, who was in charge of the steel beam riveting team, to provide personal guidance.
    On the day of the experiment, the best rivet heating worker, Liu Maolin, was in charge of the furnace, and Song Dazhen was in charge of the gun. Engineer Luo and expert Qiuliayev were guiding from the side. Each time a rivet was heated well, the expert nodded and said, "Okay," before it was passed over to start riveting. A total of ten rivets were tested that day, and eight were chipped off for inspection. The results proved that by operating according to the expert's suggestion, the rivets could be expanded by about 1.4 millimeters. The Soviet experts were also relatively satisfied, saying, "The quality has improved a step."
    At this time, there was still a rivet quality problem that hadn't been resolved: To what extent must the rivet be filled to be considered full? China hadn't riveted such long rivets on bridges before, and there were no such technical regulations. Expert Team Leader Xilin directly made several phone calls to Moscow to obtain technical data in this area. He obtained a number of no more than 0.4 millimeters. According to this standard for inspection, even Song Dazhen, who had the best results, was outside of 0.5, not reaching the standard. This immediately caused new problems in everyone's thinking. Engineer Luo flipped through many reference books. Some books mentioned that long rivets above 120 millimeters should use special-shaped rivets, and some books mentioned that the difference between the rivet shaft and the eye hole should only be one millimeter so that it could be filled to a satisfactory level after riveting. Engineer Luo believed that the rivet shaft was manufactured too thinly, but he wasn't sure. He took the book to study with expert Grigoriev. Grigoriev immediately suggested manufacturing special-shaped rivets with a diameter of 25.8 millimeters to conduct experiments. The manufactured rivets were thicker, and coupled with Song Dazhen's experience in expanding the rivet shaft, the experiment achieved a satisfactory filling level.
    At this time, it was already the end of September. Expert Tikhonov, who was on vacation in the Soviet Union, returned to the bureau and brought with him the latest technical regulations and inspection instruments. These technical regulations were formulated in June of this year when the Soviet Union solved the problem of the Volga River Sviyaga Bridge project. They had clear regulations on the inspection standards, inspection methods, and the size and shape of eye holes and rivets for rivet quality. The Soviet experts in the bureau, together with the Chinese engineers, formulated a set of technical regulations suitable for the Yangtze River Bridge based on these regulations and combined with the operating experience of Song Dazhen and others. In early October, the bureau also invited comrades from the Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory to a meeting to jointly decide to improve the rivets from the rivet design and rivet manufacturing aspects, changing the rivets to cone-shaped rivet heads and cone-shaped rivet shafts. At the same time, they organized Song Dazhen, Liu Maolin, and others to give demonstration performances in various groups to promote advanced operating experiences. This completely solved the quality problem of steel beam riveting. From October onwards, the riveting quality of the Yangtze River Bridge steel beams reached more than 95%, which was 5% higher than the national target. The Wang Haiquan Youth Riveting Team, which had the best academic performance, even achieved a pass rate of 99%.
    At the last meeting, an engineer from the Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory asked, "I am very strange, why did the Yangtze River Bridge only discover this problem after riveting for more than two months?" Engineer Luo didn't speak at the time, but after the meeting, he asked the engineer in return, "Why didn't the Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory, which has manufactured steel beams for forty years, discover this problem?" This answer seemed a bit arrogant, but Engineer Luo explained, "What I mean is that this is a new problem, not only on the Yangtze River Bridge, but also a new problem in the history of bridge construction in our country!"

    在新问题面前
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    6月，在武汉长江大桥工地上，发生了一件意外的事情。大桥钢梁已经铆了两个来月，大家还不知道怎样才能铆好。长江大桥的钢梁要铆一百万上下的铆钉，铆工质量的好坏，对大桥钢梁的寿命起着决定的作用。专家们翻阅了许多参考书，书上的记载却一直解决不了这个问题。显然这是个新问题了。
    长江大桥钢梁架设工程从7月开始铆铆钉，刚铆了几天，新来的铆钉专家茨尔柯夫便检查出铆钉铆的有“飞边”、“偏心”等不合规格的现象。为什么铆不好呢？钢梁拼铆施工的主管工程师罗其斌去请教茨尔柯夫专家，专家直截了当地对他说：“为这件事我已经有五天没睡好觉了，也没弄清楚为什么铆不好。”罗工程师又去找工人们商量，很多工人都说：“铆钉炉不好烧，铆钉枪不好使！”罗工程师了解铆工们的脾气，凡是工作上出问题，他们总是要对工具闹一阵意见的。他没有找出原因来。
    按理说，大桥钢梁的铆钉枪手们都是六级技工，技术水平不算低。他们的铆钉炉经苏联专家修改过八次，他们的铆钉枪也是从五个国家的产品中挑选出来的，设备条件是最好的。……
    一天下午，茨尔柯夫专家告诉罗工程师：今天这片钢梁斜杆拼的好，螺丝也扭的紧，我们夜里来试试究竟能不能铆好。”罗工程师见专家五天没睡好，要专家回去休息，由他来试验。晚饭后，他又去找工人们商量。他问一个姓陈的老铆工说：“你过去不是铆的挺好，为什么这次铆不好呢？”谁知老陈却回答说：“我两年没铆了。”他又问了几个工人，有的说：“我四年没铆了。”有的说：“我见都没见过这样长的铆钉。”这才使他若有所悟：“恐怕问题就出在操作不熟练技术差这方面吧。”但他又拿不定主意，想找个技术更高的铆工来试验。碰巧，一个工人向他推荐说：“我们机械经租站的宋大振是个七级工，技术挺好，经验多。罗工程师当时就写了封信，请他来试验一下。这时已经夜晚十点钟，宋大振一见这信，披上衣服赶到了工地。
    拼铆中队的几个负责人陪着铆钉枪手宋大振试验到深夜两点钟，先后在三个组铆了二十八个铆钉，没有“飞边”，没有“偏心”，每个钉头都与钢板贴的很紧。茨尔柯夫专家第二天上班一见这些铆钉，就很高兴地说：“这不是铆的很好吗？就这样铆！”
    拼铆中队立即推广了宋大振的经验，也总结和推广了烧钉工人刘茂林、李长生的操作经验。“飞边”，“偏心”和铆钉的外表质量问题解决了，钢梁架设工程的进度也加快了，十多天便跨上了第一号桥墩，架好了第一孔。这时，宋大振又在琢磨另一个问题：“大桥的钉子这样长，从两头看，铆钉是将眼孔填满了，不知道中间是不是填满了？”他便用一个冷钉塞到眼孔里去试，试的结果，冷钉在眼孔里晃晃荡荡，证明眼孔缝隙很宽。他又用卡尺量了量，发现眼孔的直径是二十六点六公厘，而铆钉钉杆只有二十四点七公厘，两者之间差一点九公厘。他便去问罗工程师：“铆钉中段不能将眼孔填满，算不算质量不好？”
    这个突如其来的问题顿时将罗工程师问住了。从前铆合钢梁，只用小锤敲敲，如不麻手、不活动就算检验合格，而现在长江大桥是先用大锤打，再用小锤敲，检验的比过去严格多了，但也没注意铆钉是否填满了眼孔。想不到宋大振这个爱动脑筋的工人却提出了这么个问题。罗工程师回去查书，反复看了多少遍，也没有找出明确的答案，而这时钢梁拼接的任务很紧，便把此事搁下来了。
    十多天以后，宋大振又把这个问题向局里施工科提了出来，并问：“这是不是对质量有影响？”负责质量检查的平光汉工程师一听这话就连忙追问道：“这种填不满的铆钉有多少？”“大部分都是这样的。”这时，平工程师急了。因为这时已是9月，钢梁已铆了两个月，却出现了这样一个问题。平工程师从钢梁上铲掉几十个铆钉来检验，发现有73％以上的铆钉都没有将眼孔填满。
    这个新的发现立即震动了大桥工地！
    工程局立即下命令说：“在铆钉的质量问题没有解决以前，钢梁停止向前拼接。这时，罗工程师领着宋大振去找专家格里佐夫。格里佐夫专家量了量铆钉钉杆的直径，又翻了翻苏联的技术规程，思索了一阵说：“苏联的标准也是这样的，还是铆下去吧！”接着他又提出了操作中要注意的几个问题。他们两人一回来，便合计着按专家的建议来进行试验。罗工程师还怕操作不合要求，又找钢梁拼铆中队的负责专家秋俩也夫去亲自指导。
    试验那天，由最好的烧钉工人刘茂林掌炉，由宋大振掌枪，罗工程师与秋俩也夫专家在旁指导。每烧好一个钉子，专家点头说：“行了。”才递过去开始铆。这天一共试验了十个铆钉，铲了八个来检验，结果证明：按照专家建议操作，便能将铆钉蹬粗一点四公厘左右。苏联专家们也比较满意地说：“质量提高了一步。”
    这时候，铆钉质量还有个问题没有解决：究竟铆钉要充填到什么程度才算将眼孔填满了？我国桥梁上没铆过这样长的铆钉，也没有这样的技术规程。专家组长西林直接跟莫斯科通了几次电话，索取这方面的技术资料。他要来了一个不得超过零点四公厘的数字。按照这个标准来检验，连成绩最好的宋大振也只在零点五以外，没有达到标准。这马上又在大家思想上引起了新的问题。罗工程师翻了许多参考书，有的书上谈到一百二十公厘以上的长铆钉应该采用特种形状的铆钉，有的书上谈到钉杆与眼孔只能相差一公厘，这样才能在铆合后填充到满意的程度。罗工程师便认为铆钉钉杆制造的细了，但又拿不定主意。他便拿着书去找格里佐夫专家研究。格里佐夫当时就建议制造二十五点八公厘粗的特种形状的铆钉来进行试验。制造的铆钉粗了，再加上宋大振蹬粗钉杆的经验，一试验，便达到了满意的充填程度。
    这时已到了9月底。在苏联休假的吉赫诺夫专家回局里来了，同时带来了一份最新的技术规程和检验仪器。这份技术规程是苏联今年6月解决伏尔加河斯维尔雅斯大桥工程的问题时才制定出来的。其中对铆钉质量的检验标准，检验方法和眼孔、铆钉的大小、铆钉形状等等，都有明确的规定。局里的苏联专家们又和我国工程师一起，根据这套规程，并结合宋大振等人的操作经验，制定出一套适合长江大桥的技术规程来。10月初，局里又邀请山海关桥梁厂的同志来开会，共同决定从铆钉设计、铆钉制造方面改进，将铆钉改成锥体形状的钉头和锥体钉杆的铆钉，同时又组织宋大振、刘茂林等人到各组去作示范表演，推广先进操作经验，这样才彻底解决了这个钢梁铆合的质量问题。从10月起，长江大桥钢梁的铆合质量便达到了95％以上，比国家指标高出5％。学习成绩最好的王海泉青年铆工组还达到了99％的合格率。
    在最后的一次会上，山海关桥梁厂有个工程师问道：“我很奇怪，为什么长江大桥在铆了两个多月后才发现这个问题？”罗工程师当时没说话，会后却向这个工程师反问道：“为什么山海关桥梁厂制造了四十年的钢梁也没发现这个问题？”这个回答好像有些不虚心，但罗工程师解释说：“我的意思是说，这是个新问题，这不仅在长江大桥，而且在我国桥梁史上也是个新问题！”
