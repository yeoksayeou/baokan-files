Response to Criticism

    Following the publication of "Save the Fine Breed Livestock of Hulunbuir League Farms" and "What Should Be Done with Such Farms?" in the "People's Daily" on April 30th and July 29th this year, which criticized the poor operation and management of state-owned farms in Hulunbuir League and the excessive death of livestock, we have actively organized efforts to curb the massive deaths of livestock. All farms have mobilized all employees to put forward many rationalization proposals for the operation and management of the farms and the rescue of weak livestock. At present, some shortcomings in the operation and management of the farms have been or are being improved.

    In order to fundamentally reverse the poor business management situation, we have decided to carry out a thorough rectification in the next two or three years, from management thinking to management systems, from farm planning to herd composition, and from the reform and improvement of organizational structures.

    We believe that it is very difficult to simultaneously establish and run more than a dozen large-scale farms on the vast grasslands without the strong support of higher authorities and the close cooperation of all parties. We hope that in the future, we can get the support of local governments and higher leading departments in the allocation of transportation capacity, the allocation of grasslands, the materials needed for farm sheds (not formal infrastructure materials) and firewood.

    呼伦贝尔盟国营牧场经营管理有改进
    今年4月30日和7月29日“人民日报”先后发表了“救救呼伦贝尔盟牧场的良种牲畜”，和“这样的牧场应该怎样办”两篇文章，批评了呼伦贝尔盟的国营牧场经营管理不善、牲畜死亡过多的现象后，我们已积极组织力量制止了牲畜的大量死亡。各牧场都发动了全体职工对牧场的经营管理和抢救瘦弱牲畜提出了许多合理化建议。目前，各牧场经营管理工作中的一些缺点，都已经或者正在改进。
    为了从根本上扭转企业经营不善的局面，我们决定在近两三年内从经营思想到管理制度，从牧场规划到畜群组成，从组织机构的改革和健全方面，进行一次彻底的整顿。
    我们认为在广阔的草原上同时建立和办好十几处大规模牧场，如果没有上级的大力支持和各方面的密切配合，是很困难的。我们希望今后能在运输力的调配、草原的分配、牧场棚圈需材（并非正规基建需材）和烧柴等问题上，都能得到当地政府和上级领导部门的支持。
