Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, December 24th. After the implementation of measures by leading organs at all levels in Gansu Province, the winter production movement in many rural areas is gradually gaining momentum. The winter irrigation work for over ten million mu of farmland in the Hexi Corridor has now been about 70% completed. Although the river water has frozen, farmers are still breaking ice along the river to try their best to irrigate more farmland. In the Yinchuan Special District on the northern Yellow River grassland, farmers in most counties have already accumulated 80%–90% of the fertilizer needed before next summer. In early December, the Party and government leading organs of the Wu Zhong Hui Autonomous Prefecture sent a large number of cadres to the countryside to help farmers carry out the winter production movement, correct the phenomenon of some agricultural cooperatives suppressing the prices of fertilizer purchased from members and the phenomenon of some places only focusing on sideline occupations and neglecting agriculture.

In terms of farmland water conservancy, this winter, in addition to building a small number of new projects, the main focus is on processing and repairing some of the water conservancy projects newly built last winter and this spring that have not been effective. Relevant departments have already begun preparing materials and conducting surveying and design work for water conservancy projects planned to be started next spring. Since the beginning of winter, the central arid area and the Pingliang Special District have experienced drought due to little snow. Therefore, in addition to repairing and building small-scale water conservancy projects, farmers in these areas are also carrying ice to the fields and carrying out soil moisture conservation activities such as harrowing and spreading sand.

    甘肃农村冬季生产运动逐步高涨起来
    呈现旱象的地区积极兴修水利和保墒
    新华社兰州24日电　甘肃省各级领导机关采取措施以后，许多地区农村中的冬季生产运动正在逐步高涨起来。河西走廊一千多万亩农田冬季灌溉工作，到现在已经完成70％左右。虽然河水已经结冰，农民们还在沿河打冰，尽量争取多灌溉一些农田。北部黄河草原上的银川专区，大部分县的农民已经积起了明年夏季前所需肥料的80％—90％。吴忠回族自治州党、政领导机关在12月上旬派大批干部下乡，帮助农民开展冬季生产运动，纠正某些农业社收买社员肥料压级压价和个别地方出现的只管副业忽视农业的现象。
    农田水利方面，今年冬季除兴修一小部分外，主要是对去冬今春新修的没有发挥效益的部分水利工程加工整修。计划在明年春季动工兴修的水利工程，现在有关部门已经开始做备料和勘测设计等准备工作。中部干旱地区和平凉专区入冬以来，由于雪少，已呈现旱象。因此这些地区的农民除整修、兴修小型水利工程外，还在往田里背冰和进行耙耱、铺砂等保墒活动。
