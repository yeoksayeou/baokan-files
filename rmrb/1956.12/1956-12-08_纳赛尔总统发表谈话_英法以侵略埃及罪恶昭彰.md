Xinhua News Agency, December 7th: TASS, Cairo, December 6th: "Akhir Sa'a" weekly reported that Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser told the magazine's reporter that the plotters' goal was not only the Suez Canal, but Egypt itself, including everything it advocates, calls for, and defends.

He said that France does not hide the fact that its opposition to Egypt is intended to consolidate its hopeless position in Algeria. Britain also makes no secret of the fact that its actions were determined by its struggle against Egypt's political influence in the Arab East, because Egypt's political influence threatens Britain's position in the Arab East.

He said that Egypt became the target of imperialist conspiracies because it defended its independence, hoped to become a strong country, broke the monopoly on weapons, and advocated that its own country and all countries that wanted their economies to be independent of foreign countries should gain freedom. He said that strong Arab nationalism has also become a target of conspiracy.

Anglo-French Turn Their Backs on Security Council Resolutions

Nasser pointed out that while Egypt was working hard for a peaceful resolution to the conflict after the Security Council adopted the well-known six principles for resolving the Suez issue, Britain and France were preparing to wage war against Egypt. Egypt had expressed its willingness to accept UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld's proposal for Egypt to meet with British and French representatives in Geneva on October 29th. However, the British and French governments delayed their responses, trying to find excuses to cancel the meeting.

Nasser said, "We later realized that the London and Paris governments wanted to do something else on that day: not to meet with Egypt, but with Israel, not in Geneva, but in Sinai. Their purpose was not to seek a way to resolve the Suez issue."

Discussing the military operations in the Sinai Peninsula, Nasser said that it was clear from the very beginning that Israel's actions were not border incidents, but outright military offensives. Nasser cited documents from Colonel Simhoni, commander of the Israeli forces in the Sinai Peninsula, obtained from downed aircraft, to illustrate the deployment and strategy of the Israeli army.

Anglo-French-Israeli Collusion

Nasser said that when Israel launched its offensive, a British Foreign Office spokesman issued a statement saying that Britain did not intend to take advantage of this opportunity to achieve its own goals. Egypt began to implement its plan to resist Israeli aggression. Subsequently, completely unexpectedly for Egypt, Britain immediately issued an ultimatum.

Nasser said: "We expected Britain and France to take hostile actions against Egypt, but we did not expect these two countries to invade Egypt together with Israel. I rejected this ultimatum. When British planes began bombing Egypt, the enemy's plan was very clearly exposed. They wanted to use the Israeli offensive to lure the main Egyptian forces to the Sinai Peninsula, and then they occupied the Suez Canal area, cutting off the rear of the main Egyptian forces. Their next step was to occupy the whole of Egypt, because at that time Egypt would be unable to resist because its army was trapped in the Sinai Peninsula. Therefore, our plan had to be revised. It was decided to immediately withdraw troops from the Sinai Peninsula and concentrate our military activities west of the canal. The troops withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula, and the enemy's plan was shattered."

Egyptian Soldiers Filled with Heroic Spirit

President Nasser, talking about the technical equipment and combat skills of the Egyptian armed forces, said, "Our bombers carried out twenty air raids on Israeli airfields."

He also said that Egypt's MiG-17 fighters were superior to the French Mystère IV fighters used by the enemy to attack us. He talked about the battle over the Kabrit airport, in which three Egyptian MiG fighters fought eight enemy planes, resulting in three enemy planes being shot down and the rest fleeing.

President Nasser also cited an example of the heroic spirit of Egyptian soldiers. In the battle of Sharm el-Sheikh, a battalion of Egyptian soldiers fought against an enemy several times their size for seven days.

Nasser said: "When our army retreated, Egypt also suffered some losses. For example, we lost thirty T-34 tanks, which were destroyed by Israeli bombers. One hundred and seventy tanks were safely evacuated from the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt lost fifty of its three hundred armored vehicles in the Sinai Peninsula."

President Nasser emphasized that the Israeli army was only able to penetrate deep into the Sinai Peninsula after the Egyptian army withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula and with the support of Britain and France.

    纳赛尔总统发表谈话
    英法以侵略埃及罪恶昭彰
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社开罗6日讯：“最后一点钟”周刊报道，埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔对这家周刊的记者说，阴谋家们的目的不只是苏伊士运河，而是埃及的本身，包括它所主张的，号召的和保卫的一切。
    他说，法国并不掩饰这一事实：法国所以要反对埃及，是打算巩固自己在阿尔及利亚的毫无希望的地位。英国也毫不隐瞒，英国的行动是由于它对埃及在阿拉伯东方的政治影响所作的斗争而决定的，因为埃及的这种政治影响威胁到英国在阿拉伯东方的地位。
    他说，埃及成为帝国主义阴谋的目标，是因为它保卫自己的独立，希望成为一个强国，打破对武器的垄断，主张自己的国家和一切希望自己的经济不依赖外国的国家获得自由。他说，强固的阿拉伯民族主义也成为阴谋的目标。
    英法背弃安理会决议
    纳赛尔指出，在安全理事会通过了众所周知的解决苏伊士问题的六项原则以后，正在埃及努力和平解决冲突的时候，英法却在准备对埃及进行战争。埃及曾经表示愿意接受联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德提出的要埃及于10月29日在日内瓦同英法代表会谈的建议。而英法两国政府迟迟不作回答，力图找寻借口取消这次会谈。
    纳赛尔说，我们后来才明白，伦敦政府和巴黎政府想在那一天作别的事：不是同埃及相会，而是同以色列相会，不是在日内瓦相会，而是在西奈相会。它们的目的不是寻求解决苏伊士问题的途径。
    纳赛尔在论述西奈半岛的军事行动时说，以色列的行动一开始就很明显，这不是边境事件，而是十足的军事进攻。纳赛尔引证在被击落的飞机中得到的西奈半岛以色列军司令西姆霍尼上校的文件，来说明以色列军队的部署和战略。
    英法以狼狈为奸
    纳赛尔说，当以色列发动进攻的时候，英国外交部发言人发表声明说，英国不打算乘这个机会来达到自己的目的。埃及开始实行抵抗以色列侵略的计划。随后，完全出乎埃及意料之外的是，英国紧接着提出了最后通牒。
    纳赛尔说：“我们预料到英法两国会对埃及采取敌对行动，但是，我们没有料到，这两个国家会同以色列一道来侵犯埃及。我拒绝了这个最后通牒。当英国飞机开始轰炸埃及的时候，敌人的计划就十分明显地暴露出来了，他们想用以色列进攻的办法把埃及的主力军队诱到西奈半岛，随后他们占领苏伊士运河地区，把埃及主力军队的后路切断。他们的下一步就是占领全埃及，因为那时候埃及将由于它的军队陷在西奈半岛而无力进行抵抗。因此，我们的计划必须加以修改。于是决定立刻从西奈半岛撤回军队，把我们的军事活动集中在运河以西。军队从西奈半岛撤退了，敌人的计划被粉碎了。”
    埃及士兵充满英雄气慨
    纳赛尔总统在谈到埃及的武装部队的技术装备和战斗技术时说，“我们的轰炸机对以色列飞机场进行了二十次空袭。”
    他又说，埃及的“米格—十七式”歼击机比敌人用来攻击我们的法国“神秘—四式”歼击机优越。他谈到在卡布里特机场上空的战斗中，三架埃及的米格式飞机和八架敌机作战，结果三架敌机被击落，其余的敌机掉头逃跑了。
    纳赛尔总统也举出了埃及士兵英雄精神的一个例子。在沙姆·沙伊赫的战斗中，一营埃及士兵同数倍于自己的敌人奋战了七天。
    纳赛尔说：“当我军撤退时，埃及也遭受了一些损失。例如，我们损失了三十辆“T—34”型坦克，这些坦克是被以色列的轰炸机炸毁的。有一百七十辆坦克自西奈半岛安全撤出。埃及在西奈半岛的三百辆装甲车损失了五十辆。”
    纳赛尔总统强调说，以色列军队，只是在埃及军队撤出西奈半岛以后，并且是在英国和法国的支持下，才能够深入西奈半岛。
