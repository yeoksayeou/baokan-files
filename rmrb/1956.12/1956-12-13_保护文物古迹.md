Protecting Cultural Relics and Historic Sites
    Jing Qiu
    Our country has a rich cultural heritage. The countless precious cultural relics and historic sites created by the broad masses of the people throughout history fully demonstrate the unique characteristics of our national culture. They are the crystallization of the blood and sweat of the ancient working people of our country. Among them, many have high historical and artistic value. They are the most valuable materials for scientific research and the most powerful physical evidence for conducting patriotic education among the broad masses of the people. Therefore, we must take extra care to protect these cultural relics and historic sites. Some people think that protecting cultural relics has nothing to do with construction, and some people think that protecting cultural relics is "maintaining feudal superstition." All these views are wrong.
    Our Party and government have always cherished these cultural relics and historic sites extremely. Since liberation, they have repeatedly pointed out the important significance of protecting cultural relics and have promulgated various policies and decrees for protecting cultural relics. However, until now, due to the lack of in-depth and widespread publicity of the policies and decrees for protecting cultural relics, and the insufficient work in popularizing knowledge of cultural relics, the situation of destroying cultural relics in various places is still extremely serious. Especially in the course of basic construction, many local cadres often use the excuse of construction needs to wantonly destroy cultural relics, causing irreparable damage to our country's cultural heritage. The incident of Longquan County, Zhejiang Province, destroying cultural relics is an even more distressing example. In order to build urban streets, they demolished three ancient pagodas that were about a thousand years old, destroying a large number of ancient scriptures, paintings, and ancient coins discovered inside the pagodas. Even after the Provincial Cultural Relics Management Committee sent several letters to stop it, the Longquan County People's Committee still ignored it. This is extremely wrong.
    The State Council's Notice on Protecting Cultural Relics in Agricultural Production and Construction points out: "Those who adopt a rude attitude towards cultural relics and historical sites, resulting in irreparable losses, should be given appropriate sanctions by the local cultural departments upon request from the supervisory departments, and those with serious circumstances should be transferred to the People's Court for sentencing according to law." It is hoped that the relevant departments will promptly conduct an inspection and handling of this incident and impose necessary sanctions on the relevant personnel. Furthermore, it is hoped that the relevant competent departments will promptly take measures to strictly prevent the recurrence of similar incidents in the future.

    保护文物古迹
    静秋
    我国有丰富的文化遗产。历代广大人民所创造的无数珍贵的文物古迹，充分表现了民族文化的特殊色采。它们都是我国古代劳动人民血汗的结晶。其中，很多有高度的历史上和艺术上的价值。它们正是进行科学研究的最宝贵的资料，也是向广大人民进行爱国主义教育最有力的实物例证。因此，我们必须加意保护这些文物古迹。有人认为保护文物同进行建设无关，有人认为保护文物是“保持封建迷信”，所有这些看法都是错误的。
    我们党和政府一直极其珍视这些文物古迹，解放以来，曾经一再指出了保护文物的重要意义，并且颁布了保护文物的各种政策和法令。但是，直到现在，由于对于保护文物的政策和法令宣传不深入、不普遍，普及文物知识工作做得不够，各地破坏文物的情况仍极严重。特别是在进行基本建设中，不少地方干部往往借口建设需要，对于文物肆意摧毁，使我国文化遗产受到了不可弥补的损失。浙江龙泉县毁坏文物的事件，更是一个令人十分痛心的例子。为了修建城区街道，他们竟拆除了三座距今千年左右的古塔，毁坏了塔内发现的大量古经、绘画和古钱等。甚至在省文物管理委员会数次致函制止后，龙泉县人民委员会仍然置之不理。这是极不应该的。
    国务院关于在农业生产建设中保护文物的通知中指出：“对于文化遗迹和文物采取粗暴态度，以致造成不可弥补的损失者，应该由当地文化部门提请监察部门予以适当的处分，情节重大者，依法移送人民法院判处”。希望有关部门尽速对于这个事件进行检查处理，并对有关人员进行必要的处分。并且，希望有关主管部门尽速采取措施，严格防止今后类似事件的继续发生。
