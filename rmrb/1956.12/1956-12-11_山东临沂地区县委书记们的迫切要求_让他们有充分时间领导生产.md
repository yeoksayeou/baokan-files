According to a report in the Shandong Dazhong Daily on the 8th of this month, in late November, a Dazhong Daily reporter visited several county Party secretaries in the Linyi area. These county Party secretaries unanimously raised an urgent demand: that they have sufficient time and energy to solve the fundamental problems in rural work—to run agricultural cooperatives well and develop agricultural production.

According to these county Party secretaries, the current situation makes it difficult for them to do this because they lack sufficient time and energy. Where has the time and energy gone? Zhang Yabin, the Party Secretary of Pingyi County, said: First, there are endless meetings and transmissions to listen to, preventing leading cadres from going down to the grassroots; second, countless business departments demand that the county Party committee manage affairs, diverting the county Party committee's energy; third, the bureaucracy is constantly expanding, with too many people sitting in offices doing reporting and transmitting work, and too few people concerned with production and cooperation.

How many meetings are there exactly? The secretaries can't remember. According to a rough estimate by Zhang Qi, the Party Secretary of Yiyuan County: In addition to the regular meetings of the entire county Party committee, the Standing Committee has to meet three times a week, each time taking an average of one day, or even two days if there are many things to do, not to mention temporary overtime; every period (such as a month or two) has to hold several days of meetings of district and township cadres to deploy and inspect work; secretaries or committee members are almost constantly taking turns going to higher levels (special districts or provinces) to attend meetings; in the gaps between all these meetings (even during mealtimes), cadres from business departments want to find secretaries to solve some individual problems, and Standing Committee members also have to attend some small meetings of the business departments under their management. This keeps the main leaders of the county Party committee tied up in meetings, leaving them no time to go to townships and cooperatives to study the urgent problems of grassroots cadres and the masses. According to Yang Lei, the Party Secretary of Junan County, before cooperation, he used to spend an average of a quarter of his time in the countryside each month. During the high tide of cooperation, he still had about a fifth of his time to go down to the countryside. Now, he almost has no time to go down at all. Zhang Qi, the Party Secretary of Yiyuan County, tried his best this year and only went down four times, for a total of less than twenty days.

Where do so many meetings come from? The central tasks and key tasks uniformly arranged by the higher Party committees must, of course, be discussed and implemented in meetings, but this does not require daily meetings. According to the secretaries, the most troublesome thing is that higher-level business departments ask the county Party committee to handle too many things: literacy issues, women's issues, transportation issues, civil affairs issues, procurement of live pigs, and even Young Pioneer issues, etc., all have to be managed by the county Party committee. Zhang Yabin said: There are too many business departments at the higher level, and they are all competing to hold meetings to deploy their own work. Many meetings end with a sentence: "Report this to the county Party committee." The transmission is often a verbatim reading of the text, and the text is very long, so the county Party committee cannot bear it. In addition to the transmissions, many documents are often brought down. According to Zhang Qi's statistics, the county Party committee receives an average of about six telegrams and instructions every day, plus some documents brought back from meetings. Where does the county Party committee find the time to read them? In this situation, all departments have to register and line up to see the county Party committee, and if they can't get in line, they have opinions; because business departments cannot get the chance to report to the county Party committee, they are often criticized by their direct superiors, putting them in a difficult position. For example, this summer, the head of the water conservancy section of Pingyi County went to the water conservancy section of the special office to attend a meeting to deploy flood prevention. When he returned, he had to report to the county Party committee. In fact, the county Party committee had already deployed flood prevention work ten days ago and sent cadres to the countryside, leaving only one secretary at home. Who should he report to? Only the secretary, because he couldn't call back the committee members who were in the countryside doing flood prevention to repeat the deployment. The county Party secretary had to talk to him individually. It is said that the comrade from the water conservancy section was criticized by his superiors because he failed to get the chance to report to the county Party committee. The county Party secretaries' distress is: they only have the obligation to ensure the implementation of the work deployed by all higher-level departments, and too little power to uniformly arrange work according to the actual conditions of their county. This autumn, when the entire county was busy with autumn distribution, the Junan County Public Security Bureau, according to instructions from above, insisted on holding a meeting of township clerks to deploy household registration, regardless of whether they could affect the allocation, a meeting of district clerks would be held instead, and then the instructions would be combined with central work before transmission to the towns. However, the Public Security Bureau disagreed, because this was an order from above and had to be implemented. As a result, a meeting of township clerks was held after all.

Since leading cadres must attend meetings, can't the actual work of production and cooperation be done by ordinary comrades? According to the secretaries, the county-level organs are now twice as large as they were two years ago. There are more cadres, but the number of people who are really working on cooperative work at the grassroots level is pitifully small. The county Party committee has added several departments and committees, and the government also has more than 20 bureaus, sections, institutes, and commissions, plus many enterprises and companies. Each department has its own superiors, its own business, and it must report upward and transmit downward, hold meetings, and do its own system's cadre work. It is not their line of work to go to the cooperatives to help study business management and production issues, and it is also difficult to do. In reality, only a few cadres in the cooperative department are really studying cooperative work. Sometimes, they reluctantly transfer a group of people to the countryside, but they all leave after ten days or half a month because they have business at home or their superiors want to hold a meeting, so they have to return. Not only that, but the serious thing is that many cadres in the county are almost all backbone cadres transferred from the district. The heads of sections and bureaus are district cadres, and the managers of professional companies are also district cadres. Now there are only eight or nine people left in the district, and they have to manage everything, but they don't have time to manage the most important thing.

In conclusion, under these circumstances, it is difficult to truly concentrate efforts on studying how to run cooperatives and agricultural production well. This raises a big question: How can the fundamental task of rural Party committees leading the effort to run cooperatives and agricultural production well be realized?

Although these county Party secretaries all modestly said that they were not good at rationally arranging work, judging from the above situation, no matter how well they arrange it, it will not work. The fundamental problem needs to be solved by the higher-level leading organs, that is, to give the lower levels sufficient time and energy to do the most important work, and more power to uniformly arrange their own work, and not let every system interfere with them.

    山东临沂地区县委书记们的迫切要求
    让他们有充分时间领导生产
    本报讯　据山东大众日报本月8日的报道，11月下旬，大众日报记者曾经分别访问了临沂地区的几位县委书记，这些县委书记一致提出了一项迫切的要求，就是让他们有充分的时间和力量去解决农村工作中的根本问题——办好农业合作社，发展农业生产。
    据这几位县委书记说，现在的情况很难使他们做到这一点，因为没有充分的时间和力量。时间和力量哪里去了呢？平邑县委书记张亚彬同志说：第一是开不完的会、听不完的传达，领导干部下不去；第二是数不清的业务部门，都要求县委去管事，分散了县委的精力；第三是机关不断膨胀，坐在办公室里做上报下达工作的人太多，过问生产合作的人太少了。
    究竟有多少会？书记们记不清了。据沂源县委书记张奇同志概略地估计：除了定期的全体县委委员会议以外，常委会每周总得开三次，每次平均是一天，事多了还得两天，临时加班还不算；一定期间（如一个月或两个月）总得开几天区乡干部会，布置检查工作；书记或委员，几乎是轮流不断地到上级（专区或省）去开会；在所有这些会议的空隙中（甚至于在吃饭的时间）业务部门的干部要找书记解决一些个别问题，常委委员们还要参加一些分工管理的业务部门的一些小会。这样就使县委的主要负责人都被会议缠住了，没有时间到乡、到社去研究基层干部和群众中的迫切问题。据莒南县委书记杨雷同志说，他自己在去年合作化以前，每月平均有四分之一的时间下乡，合作化高潮时也还有大约五分之一的时间下乡，现在呢，几乎完全没有时间下去了。沂源县委书记张奇同志今年一年，尽了最大的努力，才下去了四次，总共不足二十天的时间。
    那里来的这么多的会呢？上级党委统一布置的中心任务和重点工作，当然必须开会研究贯彻执行，不过，这用不着天天开会。据书记们谈，最头痛的是上级业务部门要叫县委办的事太多，扫盲问题、妇女问题、交通问题、民政问题、收购生猪问题，以至于少先队问题等等，都得找县委管。张亚彬同志说：上级的业务部门多了，都竞相开会布置自己的工作，许多会议结束时，总要交代一句：“要向县委传达”。传达时又常常是照本宣读，本子又很大，这样县委就吃不消了。除了传达的以外，还常带下来很多文件。而据张奇同志统计，县委平均每天大约要接到六份电报和指示，再加上一些开会带回来的文件，县委从那里找时间看呢？在这种情况下，各部门有事都得到县委去挂号排队，排不上队就有意见；因为业务部门不能争取向县委传达，往往要挨直属上级的批评，他们也是左右为难。像平邑县水利科长今夏到专署水利科开会布置防汛，回来要向县委传达，其实在十天以前，县委早已布置了防汛工作，并派了干部下乡，家里只留了一位书记。向谁传达呢？只有向书记，因为不能把下乡搞防汛的委员招呼回来再重复传达布置。县委书记只好叫个别谈谈，据说水利科的同志因此受了上级的批评，因为没能争取向县委传达。县委书记的苦恼是：只有保证执行上级所有部门布置的工作的义务，根据本县情况统一安排工作的权力太少了。今年秋季全县正在忙于进行秋季分配的时候，莒南县公安局根据上级的指示，非开乡文书会议布置户口登记不可，县委考虑这样会影响分配工作的进行，可以开区文书会布置，再结合中心工作传达到乡。但公安局不同意，因为这是上级的指示，必须执行，结果到底开了乡文书会议。
    既然领导干部必须开会，生产合作的实际工作让一般同志去做不也行吗？据书记们说，现在县级机关比两年前大了一倍到两倍，干部是多了，但真正在下面作合作社工作的人员却少得可怜。县委增设了若干部委，政府也有二十多个局、科、院、委，再加上许多企业公司，各部门都有自己的上级，都有自己的业务，都要上报下达，都要开会，都要做自己系统的干部工作，到合作社里去帮助研究一下经营管理和生产问题，不是本行，也很难做。真正研究合作社工作的，实际上只有合作部的几个干部。有时勉强调一批人下乡，十天半月之后就走光了，因为家里有业务，或者上级要开会，不得不回来。不仅如此，严重的是县里很多干部差不多都是抽调的区上的骨干，科局长是区干部，专业公司的经理还是区干部。现在区里只剩下八、九个人了，他们什么事都得管，但最主要的事却没有时间去管。
    归结起来看，在这种情况下，要真正集中力量去研究办好合作社和农业生产是困难的，这就发生了一个最大的问题：怎样实现农村党委领导办好合作社和农业生产这一根本任务？
    这几位县委书记虽然都谦虚地说自己不善于合理地安排工作，但是从上述情况看，再会安排也不行。根本问题是要上级领导机关去解决，就是要使下面有充分的时间和力量去做最主要的工作，有更多的统一安排自己工作的权力，不要什么系统都去干涉他们。
