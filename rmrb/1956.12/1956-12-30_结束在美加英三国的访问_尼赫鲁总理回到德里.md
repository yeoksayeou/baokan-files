Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 29th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru returned to Delhi on the night of the 28th after a two-week visit to the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

At Palam Airport, he told reporters: "There are still dangerous factors in the world situation. Perhaps things are a little better. But these are just small changes in this aspect or that."

Answering a question about world disarmament, Nehru said: "I certainly think the disarmament issue is a little closer to resolution than before. The distance between the two different opinions has narrowed. This is a good thing."

Among those welcoming Nehru at the airport were Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan, the President's military secretary, cabinet ministers, members of parliament, and foreign diplomatic envoys to India.

Speaking about China, Nehru said that it was not up to him to tell U.S. President Eisenhower what he should do on the China issue. Nehru said: "I explained our views to him. I believe we had a better understanding of each other's views than before."

Referring to his meeting with Eisenhower, Nehru also said: "The world situation does not change because two leaders meet and discuss issues. Travel cannot change the world, only events can change the world."

Speaking about the situation in West Asia, he said that clearing the Suez Canal was a step forward in easing tensions. He said: "But after this step, we must continue to move forward—we must move forward step by step."

Nehru said that he had mentioned the Kashmir issue during his talks with the U.S. President. He did not elaborate on this.

When a reporter asked Nehru if he had advised Dulles to change his attitude towards Goa, he replied that you must have noticed that Dulles himself has changed his views after the joint statement on the Goa issue was issued by Dulles and Cunha (Portuguese Foreign Minister).

    结束在美加英三国的访问
    尼赫鲁总理回到德里
    新华社新德里29日电　印度总理尼赫鲁在美国、加拿大和英国作了两个星期的访问以后，在28日夜里回到德里。
    他在巴兰机场对记者们说：“世界局势中仍旧存在着危险的因素。或许情况要好一些。但是这只是这方面或那方面的一些小变化。”
    尼赫鲁在回答关于世界裁军问题的时候说：“我确实认为裁军问题较前稍为接近解决。两种不同的意见之间的距离已经缩小。这是一件好事。”
    到机场欢迎尼赫鲁的有：印度副总统拉达克里希南，总统军事秘书，内阁阁员，国会议员和各国驻印度的外交使节。
    尼赫鲁在谈到中国的时候说，谈不上由他来告诉美国艾森豪威尔总统在中国问题上他应该怎样做。尼赫鲁说：“我向他解释了我们的意见。我相信，我们当时比以前更好地体会到对方的见解。”
    尼赫鲁在谈到同艾森豪威尔的会谈时又说：“世界的局势并不因为两个领袖会晤和讨论问题而有所改变。旅行改变不了世界，而只有事态才能改变世界。”
    他在谈到西亚局势的时候说，清理苏伊士运河是在缓和紧张局势方面前进了一步。他说：“但是，在这一步以后我们必须继续前进——我们必须一步一步地前进。”
    尼赫鲁说，在他同美国总统会谈的时候，曾经提到了克什米尔问题。他对这一点没有详细说明。
    有记者问尼赫鲁，他是否曾经劝杜勒斯改变对果阿的态度。他回答说，你们一定已经注意到，在杜勒斯和库纳（葡萄牙外交部长）关于果阿问题的联合声明发表以后，杜勒斯本人已经改变了他的见解。
