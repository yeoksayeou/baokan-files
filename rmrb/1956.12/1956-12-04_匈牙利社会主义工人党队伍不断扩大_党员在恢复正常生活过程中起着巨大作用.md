　　Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd. (TASS, Moscow, December 1st dispatch) "Pravda" special correspondents Krushinsky and Mayevsky reported from Budapest that more than half of Hungary's national industrial enterprises are concentrated in Budapest. This is precisely why reactionary forces spent so much effort to obstruct the resumption of work in Budapest's factories. However, the reactionary forces were resolutely repulsed. The workers of the Hungarian capital united to defend the achievements of socialism and the country's socialist development path. They overcame numerous difficulties and enabled factories to resume work one after another. Party members of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party are playing an increasingly important role in this process of restoring life.
    We came to Angyalföld, a working-class district of Budapest, and met with staff members of the Party District Committee and Communist Party members from the factories. Those who spoke with us said that the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has been striving from the beginning to avoid making mistakes and the shortcomings that occurred in the Hungarian Working People's Party in the past. The ranks of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party are constantly growing. This district elected a temporary executive committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party district party organization composed of nine comrades. The members of the executive committee and the staff of the district committee are now establishing contact with party members in the factories and visiting party organizations. The most important task that the district party organization is now doing, and that party members are extremely concerned about, is to fight for the rapid resumption of production.
    In order to gain a deeper understanding of this struggle, we visited "Ganz" Shipyard, the largest industrial enterprise in the district. One of the members of the temporary executive committee of the factory's party organization is an ordinary worker named Zoltán Viola, who previously obtained an engineering qualification through part-time study and served as a workshop director. In the past, he was expelled from the party because he criticized the factory director at a meeting. Later, life proved that his criticism was completely correct. He was reinstated into the party only three months ago. When reactionary forces were rampant, worker committee elections were held at the factory under the brutal pressure exerted by reactionary forces. The reactionary elements tried their best to prevent everyone from electing Communist Party members to the worker committee. However, Viola was still elected. At that time, the situation in the factory was very complex. The worker committee, influenced by reactionary elements, obstructed the resumption of work. However, healthy forces gradually prevailed, and reactionary elements were isolated. Last weekend, the factory began extensive planning for the resumption of production. The reactionaries also tried to convince the workers that the factory did not need a party organization at all. When Viola talked about this matter, he said:
      "We answered them: the Party existed, exists, and will continue to exist. We are engaged in building the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party according to our own wishes and have not received any instructions." If you want to describe the mood of the party members in the district now in a few words, it is: high spirits, hope for work and progress. The situation in enterprises in other industrial areas of Budapest is also gradually changing in this direction.
    On November 29, the temporary executive committee of the Angyalföld District of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party convened a meeting of party activists, attended by about three hundred people. The secretary of the district's temporary executive committee, Kish, gave a report. He analyzed the events of the past few weeks and then talked about the party's organizational tasks. In the enthusiastic discussions on Kish's report, the speakers all talked about what kind of party the new party should be. One speaker said, "We should not allow the situation to arise where our workers become weak in the fight against counterrevolution. We should admit those who firmly defend socialism into the party."
      The Hungarian working class now faces an arduous and complex task: to establish a party that should be a true organizer of the struggle of the working masses for socialism and for eradicating past mistakes. There is no doubt that the banner of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party will become the banner of all Hungarian working people fighting for socialism.

　　匈牙利社会主义工人党队伍不断扩大
　　党员在恢复正常生活过程中起着巨大作用
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科1日讯：“真理报”特派记者克鲁辛斯基和马耶夫斯基从布达佩斯报道说，大家知道，匈牙利全国工业企业半数以上集中在布达佩斯。正因为如此，反动势力才花了这么大的力量来阻挠布达佩斯各工厂复工。但是反动势力遭到了坚决的回击。匈牙利首都的工人团结一致展开保卫社会主义成果、保卫国家的社会主义发展道路的斗争，他们克服了重重困难，使工厂一个接着一个地复工：他们正在展开生产、恢复秩序。匈牙利社会主义工人党党员在这个恢复生活的过程中日益起着巨大的作用。
    我们来到安吉亚耳费耳杰——布达佩斯的一个工人区，会见了党区委会的工作人员和工厂里来的共产党员们。和我们谈话的人说，匈牙利社会主义工人党从一开始就竭力避免犯错误和过去在匈牙利劳动人民党内发生的缺点。匈牙利社会主义工人党的队伍在不断壮大。这个区选举了一个由九个同志组成的匈牙利社会主义工人党区党组织的临时执行委员会。执行委员会的委员们和区委机构的工作人员现在正在同工厂的党员们建立联系，访问党组织。区党组织现在所做的、党员们极端关心的最重要的工作就是为迅速开展生产而斗争。
    为了更深入地熟悉这次斗争的情况，我们访问了这个区中最大的工业企业“甘兹”造船厂。这个工厂党组织的临时执行委员会中有一个普通工人名叫佐尔坦·维奥拉，他过去在业余学习中获得了工程师的资格，担任过车间主任。过去，因为他在会上批评了厂长而被开除出党。后来生活证明他的批评是完全正确的。他是在三个月以前才恢复党籍的。这个工厂在反革命势力猖獗的时候，在反革命势力施加粗暴压力的情况下举行了工人委员会的选举。反革命分子竭力想让大家不把共产党员选到工人委员会里去。但是维奥拉还是当选了。当时工厂的情况非常复杂。在反革命分子影响下的工人委员会阻挠复工。但是健康力量逐渐得胜，反革命分子被孤立起来了。上周末，工厂中开始广泛地筹划恢复生产。反动派还力图使工人相信工厂中根本不需要党组织。维奥拉谈到这件事情的时候说：
      “我们回答他们：党过去、现在和将来仍然存在。我们从事建立匈牙利社会主义工人党是根据自己的愿望，并没有受到任何指令。”如果想用几句话来描述区里党员们现在的情绪，那就是：高涨，希望工作和前进。布达佩斯其他工业区的企业中的情况也逐渐朝这个方向变化。
    11月29日，匈牙利社会主义工人党安吉亚耳费耳杰区临时执行委员会召开了党积极分子会议，参加的约三百人。区临时执行委员会书记基什作了报告。他分析了过去几周发生的事件，然后谈到了党的组织任务。在就基什的报告展开的热烈的讨论中，发言的人都谈到新党应该是什么样的一个党。有一个发言人说，“不应当允许发生我们工人在同反革命斗争的时候变得软弱无力这种情况。应当接收那些坚定地保卫社会主义的人入党。”
      匈牙利工人阶级现在面临着一项艰巨的和复杂的任务：建立一个应当是劳动群众争取社会主义，争取根除过去的错误的斗争的真正组织者的党。毫无疑问，匈牙利社会主义工人党的旗帜会成为为社会主义而斗争的所有匈牙利劳动人民的旗帜。
