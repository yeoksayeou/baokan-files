    Pushing and Pressing
    Nan Ren
    When bureaucratic work style exists, it should be honestly examined, criticized, and overcome.
    However, some people do not do this, but instead adopt the methods of "pushing" and "pressing," hoping to resolve the matter with a push and a press.
    If it were truly possible to resolve things with a push and a press, it would be desirable for all those with bureaucracy in the world to adopt this method. Using this method to solve the problem of bureaucracy would neither require intense and painful ideological struggle, nor would it require changing one's work style, working methods, or lifestyle. This would be much more convenient and easier.
    The fact is precisely not so. The methods of "pushing" and "pressing" not only cannot overcome bureaucracy, but also develop it. "Pushing" and "pressing" are themselves one of the bureaucratic methods of handling problems.
    There is evidence for this: According to the People's Daily (December 15th), the CCP Hua County Committee in Guangdong Province, precisely because it adopted the method of "pushing," in addition to the original style of not understanding the situation below and issuing orders from the office, added a bureaucratic work style. That is, when mistakes occurred in their work, they dared not admit them boldly, but instead pushed the responsibility for the errors onto lower-level cadres. The CCP Qin County Committee Rural Work Department in Shanxi Province adopted another method of "pushing," because it did not understand the situation below, the problem of excessive restrictions on the activities of members in a small number of cooperatives was never resolved. This cannot but be said to be a relatively serious problem. But the more serious problem is still here. When Wei Xiaoyuan, a member of the Xindian Township Cooperative, exposed and demanded the handling of this problem, the Rural Work Department's reply was: Please let your village branch secretary solve it! Pushing this matter to one of the parties involved to handle.
    "Pressing" not only generally develops bureaucracy, but also changes the nature of the problem.
    Leaders of the Penglai Sub-bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Taxation Bureau, without understanding the situation below, promoted a cadre who should not have been promoted. As a result, 80%-90% of the cadres in the entire bureau raised objections. Fang Zhiyuan, a Communist Party member in the Supervision Section responsible for communication work, truthfully reported this situation to the higher authorities. In principle, the person in charge of the sub-bureau should immediately investigate and handle this matter. However, Gao Yunqiao, the director of the sub-bureau and a Communist Party member, did not do so. First, he criticized the Supervision Section at an enlarged meeting of the sub-bureau's administrative affairs, and then asked the Personnel Section to transfer Fang Zhiyuan away from the sub-bureau to be "reformed." When Fang Zhiyuan raised objections, Gao Yunqiao said: "You are not allowed to speak!" And threatened Fang Zhiyuan: "Tomorrow we will deal with you at the general meeting of party members, and deal with you at the mass meeting! Let's see what you can do? It doesn't matter if you go to the Municipal Bureau to sue, or to the Municipal Party Committee to sue, or even to the Central Committee!" Gao Yunqiao thought: In this way, he could completely cover up his own bureaucracy. In fact, it exposed the seriousness of Gao Yunqiao's bureaucracy, and he was qualified to be called a bureaucrat.
    The above facts also show that although the purpose of "pushing" and "pressing" is to cover up one's own bureaucracy, the nature of the two is different. The former is mainly due to a lack of clear understanding of the bureaucratic work style on oneself, so they "push" it out and refuse to admit it. The Hua County Committee did not realize that its decision to complete the spring harvest of wheat before April 5th in the entire county was wrong. When errors occurred in individual areas, they thought it was a problem in the implementation of the decision, not a problem with the decision itself. The latter is different, it has already involved the issue of ideological character. "Correct mistakes if you have them, and guard against them if you don't," this is the attitude that anyone should have towards criticism. Those with bureaucracy should have an even more welcoming attitude towards criticism. Gao Yunqiao clearly had bureaucracy, but did not allow others to expose it. After others exposed it, he adopted repressive and retaliatory measures. In Gao Yunqiao, it is difficult to smell the air of a Communist Party member.
    Tell all those with bureaucratic work styles, honestly conduct self-examination, criticism, and strive to overcome it.

    推和压
    南人
    有了官僚主义作风，就应该老老实实地检查、批判和克服。
    但是有些人却不是如此，而是采用“推”和“压”的方法，想一推一压了事。
    要是真能够一推一压了事的话，愿天下有官僚主义的人，都来采用这个方法。用这个方法来解决官僚主义问题，既不要进行激烈的痛苦的思想斗争，又不要改变自己的工作作风、工作方法和生活方式。这真是省事得多，轻松得多。
    事实恰恰不是如此，“推”和“压”的方法，不但不能克服官僚主义，而且发展了官僚主义。“推”和“压”，就是官僚主义地处理问题的方法之一。
    这有事实为证：据人民日报（12月15日）报道，中共广东花县县委，就因为采用了“推”的方法，除了原来的不了解下情，坐在办公室里发号施令作风外，又增加了一种官僚主义作风，这就是工作中发生了错误，不能大胆承认，而把错误责任推在下级干部身上。中共山西沁县县委农村工作部采用另一种“推”的方法，因为不大了解下情，少数合作社中限制社员活动过多的问题一直得不到解决。这不能不说是一个较为严重的问题。但是更严重的问题还在这里，当新店乡合作社社员魏小员揭发并要求处理这个问题时，农村工作部的答复是：请你村支部书记解决吧！把这件事情就推给当事人之一去处理。
    “压”，不仅仅一般地发展了官僚主义，而且使问题的性质起了变化。
    上海市税务局蓬莱分局领导上，不了解下情，提拔了一个不应提拔的干部，因此全局80％—90％干部提出了反对意见。分局监察科担任通讯工作的共产党员房志远，向上级如实地反映了这个情况。按理，分局的负责人应当立即调查、处理这件事情。而分局局长、共产党员高耘樵却不是如此，先在分局局务扩大会议上把监察科批评一顿，继而要人事科把房志远调离分局，“下去改造”。房志远提出不同意见时，高耘樵就说：“不准你讲话！”并且对房志远进行威胁：“明天在全体党员会上搞你，在群众大会上搞你！看你怎么样？你到市局去告也好，到市委去告也好，到中央去告也好！”在高耘樵想：这样一来，就把自己的官僚主义掩盖得一干二净。其实，暴露了高耘樵的官僚主义的严重性，他已够得上叫官僚主义分子。
    上述事实还说明了：“推”和“压”的目的虽然都是想掩盖自己的官僚主义，但是两者的性质是不同的。前者主要是对自身上的官僚主义作风认识不清，所以“推”出去不肯承认。花县县委就因为没有认识到自己所作的全县在4月5日前割完春收小麦的决定是错误的，在个别地区发生错误时，以为这是执行决定中的问题，不是决定本身的问题。后者就不同，已涉及到思想品质问题。“有则改之，无则加勉”，这是任何人对批评应抱的态度。有官僚主义的人，对批评更应抱欢迎的态度。高耘樵明明有官僚主义，但是不许别人揭露，别人揭露以后，就采取压制、报复的手段。在高耘樵身上，已很难嗅到共产党员的气味了。
    奉告一切有官僚主义作风的人，还是老老实实地进行检查、批判，并努力克服吧。
