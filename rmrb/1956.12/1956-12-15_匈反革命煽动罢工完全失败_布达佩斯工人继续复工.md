Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 13th: The partial strike in Budapest, the Hungarian capital, has ended today.

　　From early morning, the city's underground trams, trams, trolleybuses, and buses were running as usual. Various shops have gradually opened for business. Repair work on the streets is proceeding at the normal pace. Factories have resumed work, with 80% of workers returning to their jobs.

　　The forty-eight-hour general strike incited by the now-disbanded Budapest Central Workers' Council has failed. Despite the agitators' desperate incitement in many factories in Budapest in the past two days, even resorting to intimidation and assassination, and the bandits' sabotage of transportation and shooting of tram drivers to prevent workers from going to work, the strike was only partial. On December 12th, half of the workers in Budapest still went to work in the factories. Some of those who did not go to work were unable to do so because the factories were controlled by counter-revolutionaries and the workers were afraid to go, while others were unable to reach the factories due to transportation blockades. On this day, only part of the city's transportation was suspended, while trains from other places continued to arrive at Budapest's East and West stations as usual. Food, water, and electricity supplies were not affected.

　　The strike has been condemned by honest workers and public opinion. In the past two days, workers' committees in many factories in Budapest have issued appeals against the strike. There are many slogans on the streets calling for resumption of work.

### 匈反革命煽动罢工完全失败  布达佩斯工人继续复工

    匈反革命煽动罢工完全失败
    布达佩斯工人继续复工
    据新华社布达佩斯13日电　匈牙利首都布达佩斯的部分罢工，今天已经结束。
    从清早起，市内地下电车、有轨电车、无轨电车和公共汽车都和平常一样出动行驶。各种商店都陆续开门营业。街道上的修复工作在照平常的速度在进行。工厂已经复工，有80％的工人到工厂去上工。
    这次由已被解散的布达佩斯中央工人委员会所煽动的四十八小时的总罢工是失败了。尽管挑拨分子前两天在布达佩斯许多工厂里拚命煽动，甚至进行恐吓暗杀，匪徒们还破坏交通和射击电车司机以阻挠工人上工，但是罢工只是部分的。在12日，布达佩斯仍然有一半工人到工厂上工。那些没有到工厂去上工的人，有的是由于工厂被反革命分子把持了，工人不敢去上工，有的是由于交通被阻断了，没有办法到工厂去。这一天，市内交通只有部分停顿，外地的火车还是照常开到布达佩斯东、西两车站。食品和水电供应没有受到影响。
    这次罢工受到了正直工人和舆论的谴责。过去两天，布达佩斯有许多工厂的工人委员会发出号召，反对罢工。街上有许多要求复工和工作的标语。
