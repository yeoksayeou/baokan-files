    Indiscriminate Book Buying is Undesirable

    During this period, a stream of book purchasing personnel from other places has poured into Xinhua bookstores in some large cities. Taking the Shanghai branch of Xinhua Bookstore as an example, in the two months of October and November alone, people from more than fifty units from other places came to buy books there. Some organizations, groups, and schools from as far north as Inner Mongolia, as far south as Guangxi and Yunnan, and as far west as Gansu and Xinjiang, have also rushed to Shanghai to buy books. These purchasing personnel from other places can be described as "big spenders" of Xinhua Bookstore, and the amount and urgency of their demand are truly astonishing. For example, the purchasing agent of Lanzhou Chemical Engineering College bought 6,000 yuan worth of books from the sales department of Xinhua Bookstore Shanghai Branch in one go; the purchasing agent of Pingxiang Coal Mine also bought 6,000 yuan worth; as soon as the purchasing agent of Chongqing University arrived at the bookstore's sales department, they asked for five to ten copies of each book except for those in civil engineering, automobiles, textiles, and chemical industries. The purchasing agent of Luzhou Police School handed a copy of the "National Bibliography" to the bookstore clerk, saying that they wanted three to five copies of each title. ... In this way, the Shanghai branch of Xinhua Bookstore sold a total of 100,000 yuan worth of books to purchasing agents from other places in October alone.

    At present, with the national paper supply being tight and serious blindness still existing in publishing and distribution work, there is already a significant contradiction between the supply and demand of books. These purchasing personnel from other places, rushing to buy books in large cities batch after batch, will only disrupt the supply plans of bookstores in large cities and deepen the contradiction between book supply and demand.

    Of course, it is difficult for us to say that all the books bought by these units are unnecessary, however, at this time nearing the end of the year, buying books in such large quantities with so little selection is bound to make people suspect that they are "spending money in a hurry" again. Therefore, I suggest that relevant departments in various regions pay attention to this issue, prevent various units from "rushing" to spend their year-end surplus book funds, and when there is a real need to buy books, choose carefully and do not buy indiscriminately, so as to avoid wasting national paper and artificially creating an imbalance in book supply and demand.

    不可滥买书
    这一个时期，一些大城市的新华书店里，涌来了一批又一批的外地采购图书的人员。以新华书店上海分店为例，在10、11月两个月中，就有外地的五十多个单位的人到他们那里买书。北至内蒙古，南至广西、云南，西至甘肃、新疆的一些机关、团体和学校，也纷纷赶到上海来买书。这些外地采购人员，可称得上是新华书店的“阔客”，他们要货之多、要货之急，实在惊人。像兰州化工学院的采购员，一次向新华书店上海分店的门市部买了六千元的图书；萍乡煤矿的采购员也买了六千元；重庆大学的采购员一到书店门市部，除去土建、汽车、纺织和化工类的书籍以外，其余的每种书都要五到十本。芦州警校的采购员拿了一本“全国总书目”交给书店营业员，说是每种要配三到五本。……就这样，新华书店上海分店仅仅在十月份，就被外地采购员买去总值达十万元的书籍。
    在目前全国纸张供应紧张，出版发行工作中还有严重盲目性的情况下，书籍的供应与需求之间，已经存在很大的矛盾。这些外地采购人员，一批又一批地到大城市书店抢购书籍，结果只会打乱大城市书店的供应计划，加深书籍供求之间的矛盾。
    当然，我们很难说这些单位所买的书都是不应该买的，不过，在这将近年终的时候，像这样很少加以选择地大量买书，势必会使人怀疑他们是不是又在“突击花钱”了。因此，我建议各地有关部门重视这个问题，防止各单位“突击”花掉年终结余的图书经费，并且在真正需要买书的时候，要加以仔细选择，不要滥买，以免浪费国家纸张，和人为地造成图书供求失调现象。
