Xinhua News Agency report: In the rural areas of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Shaanxi, Gansu, and other provinces, winter literacy campaigns have been launched one after another.

By early December, nearly three million illiterate people in rural Shandong Province had enrolled in school. According to statistics from 82 counties in Shanxi Province, more than 1.23 million illiterate people are participating in learning. In the nine special districts of Tangshan and Handan in Hebei Province, 1.2 million farmers have already joined the literacy campaign. In the Cangxian Special District, more than 48,000 disaster victims are both engaging in production for self-relief and persisting in literacy studies. In some areas where literacy work has been carried out well, such as Andong County in Liaoning Province and Xinjiang County in Shanxi Province, the number of farmers enrolled in school has accounted for more than 50% of the total number of illiterate people in the county. Some places have also set up spare-time senior primary and junior high school classes to meet the learning needs of literacy graduates and rural senior primary school graduates.

Before launching the winter studies, various places generally carried out preparatory work such as intensive training of teachers, compiling and printing textbooks, and raising funds. Most of the teacher backbone trained this year are senior primary school graduates participating in agricultural production, literacy graduates, demobilized construction soldiers, and some original teachers. Counties and cities in Hebei Province have trained more than 60,000 literacy teacher backbones, with an average of more than 420 people trained in each county. In Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, each agricultural cooperative trained eleven to twelve teachers.

Many areas, when organizing farmers to enroll in school, have adopted various learning organizational forms based on the characteristics of many winter sideline production and central tasks. Shenze County and Xian County in Hebei established learning organizations in production units engaged in sideline production such as shipbuilding, cotton ginning, textile, and transportation. Some agricultural cooperatives have implemented the method of "unified leadership by the cooperative, with learning organized by the team," strengthening the role of the production team in guaranteeing cultural learning. The members of the fourteen production teams of the Northeast Township Cooperative in Kaiyuan County, Liaoning Province, "hit the threshing ground" at the rooster's crow every day, finished work before dinner, and started studying after dinner, ensuring that both production and learning are not delayed.

    河北、山东等省广大农村
    采取多种形式开展扫盲学习
    新华社讯　河北、山东、山西、辽宁、吉林、陕西、甘肃等省农民冬季扫除文盲学习陆续开始。
    到12月上旬，山东省农村已有近三百万文盲入学。据山西省八十二个县的统计，共有一百二十三万多文盲参加学习。在河北省唐山、邯郸等九个专区中，已有一百二十万农民参加学习。沧县专区四万八千多灾民，一面生产自救，一面坚持扫除文盲学习。在有些扫除文盲工作开展较好的地方，例如辽宁省安东县，山西省新绛县等地，入学农民已占全县文盲总数的50％以上。有些地方还举办了业余高小、初中班，来满足扫除文盲毕业学员以及乡村高小毕业生的学习要求。
    各地在开展冬季学习前，一般进行了集训教师、编印课本、筹措经费等准备工作。今年集训的教师骨干大部分是参加农业生产的高小毕业生、扫除文盲毕业学员、复员建设军人和一些原有的教师。河北省各县、市共训练六万多名扫除文盲教师骨干，平均每县训练四百二十多人。黑龙江省绥化县每个农业社训练十一十二名教师。
    许多地区在组织农民入学时，根据冬季副业生产和中心工作多的特点，采取了多种多样的学习组织形式。河北深泽县、献县在开展副业生产的造船、轧花、纺织、运输等生产单位中建立了学习组织。有些地方的农业社实行了“社统一领导，分队组织学习”的办法，加强了生产队对文化学习的保证作用。辽宁省开原县东北乡合作社十四个生产队的队员，每天鸡叫起来“打场”，晚饭前收工，饭后开始学习，做到生产、学习两不误。
