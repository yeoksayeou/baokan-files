    On the Road in Southern Hunan
　　Chen Xiufei
    A few months ago, I took a bus from Jiahe County to the Chen County Commissioner's Office for a meeting. Along the way, I experienced some things that gave me cause for reflection. I want to record my travels in this small corner of southern Hunan:

    Honeycomb Highway
    As soon as the bus left Jiahe Station, it hit a big bump head-on, and everyone in the carriage was thrown up high. Because I wasn't prepared, my head hit the roof of the car, and it hurt a lot. After that, there were countless such bumps. We were really like sitting on a small sailboat in a big storm. As long as we didn't grab the handrail, there was a danger of tipping over to the side. I stuck my head out of the window and saw that the entire highway was uneven, like a honeycomb, with deep marks left by the wheels everywhere...

    I asked a comrade next to me, "Isn't this a newly built highway?"
    "Don't you know? This is the famous section of highway that was completed at ten o'clock. It was even rewarded for its fast progress!"

  The Commotion at the Small Station
    The bus arrived at a midway station on the Jialin section—Xinxu. The driver stopped the car and said he had to drop off the mail. Everyone braved the hot sun and the fumes from the furnace (it was a white charcoal car) and waited for half an hour. After much difficulty, the matter was settled, and the car doors were closed, and the engine roared. "Wait a minute! Wait a minute!..." The comrade who had just picked up the mail packages ran over again, sweating profusely, saying that he had lost a small mail package on the car. So everyone reluctantly watched him search from the car compartment to the roof, the tarpaulin was lifted, and the luggage was messed up, but the small package was still not found.
    "Don't look for it!" Someone shouted, "We need to hurry."

    The angry voices of the masses made the comrade at the postal agency very embarrassed. He couldn't help but come down, with a bitter face, and said:
    "Don't blame me, comrades, it's the postal office over there that didn't do a good job." The car finally started, and I looked at my watch. We stopped at this small station for a total of fifty minutes because of this small package.

    Only Half the Distance
    The bus arrived at Linwu Station at a little after five o'clock in the afternoon. The sun was still high in the sky, but we had to stop. Although the Jiahe to Pingshi route is a highway, it is divided into two sections: the first section ends at Linwu; the second section goes from Linwu to Pingshi.

    At Jiahe Bus Station, we asked to buy tickets directly to Pingshi, but the station refused. We asked him why they divided a highway into two sections, increasing the trouble for passengers to buy tickets and transfer cars?
    "We don't care!" the bus station replied at the time. "This is a decision made by the higher authorities."
    "Higher authorities? Can't you offer your opinion to them?"
    "We did in the first half of the year, but the Provincial Transportation Bureau wouldn't consider these small problems!"
    We had to hurriedly inquire about the bus to Pingshi tomorrow.

    But someone brought very disappointing news: "Tickets for the bus to Pingshi tomorrow were sold out this afternoon."

    In a Cage
    The next morning, before dawn, we climbed into a cage-like freight car.

    This car, which "specially took care" of us, didn't have a single window. After the car started, only some wind could blow in from the tightly stretched tarpaulin seams on the roof. The stuffiness was self-evident. Moreover, the car was filled with a foul, nauseating smell of pig manure. The smell was so strong that even covering your mouth and nose with a towel didn't help much. So some people fainted, and more people were vomiting... The car didn't stop, and everyone, with empty stomachs, endured the stench, persevering hour after hour.

    At Suyuanpu, three stations away from Pingshi, our car had just stopped when someone was forcefully opening the back door. Four burly men appeared outside, all holding poles and ropes. After opening the car door, they were stunned when they saw us.

    "Ah! No, no." One of them hurriedly backed away. "Today we're carrying people, not pigs!"

    I suddenly remembered a slogan inside the gate of the Linwu Bus Station, saying that it was necessary to strengthen the care for people. I thought I had truly tasted the "care" of this transportation department for people. (Attached picture)

### 湘南道上

    湘南道上
　　陈修飞
    前几个月，我由嘉禾县乘汽车回郴县专署开会。一路上，所见所历，有些感慨。我愿把在湘南这个小小的角落里的旅行记下：
    蜂窝公路
    汽车刚开出嘉禾站，迎头就来了一个大颠簸，整个车厢的人，都被抛起很高，我因没有防备，头碰到车顶，碰得很疼。此后，这样的颠簸，就数也数不清了，我们真像在大风浪中坐了一只小帆船，只要一下子不抓住扶手，就有向旁边倾倒的危险。我把头伸出窗外一看，原来整个公路，高低不平，像蜂窝一样，到处都可以看到被车轮辗坏的深深的印痕……
    我问旁边的一个同志：“这不是一条新修的公路吗？”
    “你不知道吗？这就是著名的十点钟修成的一段公路，因为进度快，还受过奖励呢！”
  小站上的风波汽车开到了嘉临段一个中途站——新墟。司机停车说要下邮件。大家就冒着大太阳和火炉的熏烤（是白炭车），等了半小时。好容易办清楚了，关上车门，马达吼叫了。“等一等！等一等！……”刚才取邮包的同志又满头大汗地跑来，说他还遗失一个小邮包在车上。于是大家又忍着气，看着他从车厢里找到车顶上，油布掀开了，行李翻乱了，那小包还没找出来。
    “不要找了吧！”有人嚷起来：“我们赶路要紧。”
    群众的愤怒声，使邮局代办所的同志十分为难。他不能不下来，苦着脸说：
    “这不能怪我啊，同志们，是那边邮局办得不好。”车终于开了，我看看表，为了这个小包，我们在这个小站共停了五十分钟。
    只走一半路
    汽车到临武车站是下午五点多钟。太阳还老高呢，我们就不得不停下来了。因为嘉禾到坪石尽管走的是一条公路，却分为两段：第一段到临武止；第二段再由临武到坪石。
    在嘉禾汽车站，我们曾要求直买到坪石的票，车站不肯，我们问他，为什么要把一条公路分成两段，增加旅客购票和转车的麻烦呢？
    “我们不管！”当时汽车站这样回答。“这是上级决定的。”
    “上级？你们就不能提意见上去么？”
    “上半年就提了，省运输局那里会考虑到这些小问题！”
    我们只好急忙打听明天到坪石的汽车。
    有人却送来一个令人非常失望的消息：“明天到坪石的车票，今天下午已经卖光了。”在笼子里
    第二天清晨，天还没有大亮，我们就爬进一辆笼子似的货车车厢里了。
    这个“特殊照顾”我们的车，没有一个窗子，开车以后，只能从车顶那紧绷着的大油布缝里，吹进一些风来。闷热自不必说，且说这车厢里面，到处散发着一种难闻的、令人作呕的猪屎味，气味是这样浓烈以致用手巾捂住口鼻，也效用不大，于是有人昏倒了，更多的人在呕吐……汽车一直没停，大家空着肚子，挨着臭味的侵袭，一小时，一小时地坚持下去。
    在离坪石还有三个站的粟源堡，我们的车子刚停下来，就有人在用力开着后门，外面出现了四个彪形大汉，他们都拿着杠子、绳子，开开车门后，一看见我们，就楞住了。
    “啊！不是不是。”其中一个忙往后退。“今天装的是人，不是猪！”
    我忽然想起了临武汽车站大门里的一张标语，说要加强对人的关心，我想我是真正尝到这个运输部门的对人的“关心”了。（附图片）
