　　北京—莫斯科—布拉格直达航线开航
　　喷气式客机载运旅客当日到达
    据新华社2日讯　北京—莫斯科—布拉格直达航线今天正式开航。今天下午二时三十分，一架TY—104喷气客机载着九名旅客在北京南苑机场着陆；停留两个半小时以后，它又载着中国、捷克斯洛伐克、德国、南斯拉夫和瑞典等五个国家的三十四名旅客飞离北京。
    这架飞机由于受气候的影响，在来北京的途中曾经在伊尔库茨克降落过夜。
    这条航线将使用苏联民航局的TY—104喷气式客机飞行；每星期六由布拉格、莫斯科飞来北京，星期日由北京飞往莫斯科、布拉格，往返都在当日到达。由北京起飞时间是上午七时三十分，到达莫斯科是当地时间下午一时四十分，到达布拉格是当地时间下午三时半。这条三个城市间的直达空运的开辟，将使我国和苏联及东欧人民民主国家之间交通联系更加便利。
