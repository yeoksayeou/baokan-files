Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 30th: French Foreign Minister Bidault delivered a year-end radio address on the evening of the 28th.

    In this speech, Bidault attempted to defend France's colonial policy in North Africa. He also vehemently attacked Egyptian President Nasser, saying that he "helped" the "rebellion activities" in Algeria, and "threatened Israel with destruction and seized the property of the Suez Canal."

    Bidault repeated anti-Soviet clamoring on the Middle East and Hungarian issues; at the same time, he expressed dissatisfaction with the position taken by the United Nations on the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt.

    Bidault called for the "realization of European unity." He said that the events of the past few months have convinced the French government that it is now more necessary than ever to achieve "European unity." He believes that if Western European countries do not unite their efforts, they will sooner or later be incorporated into one of the "two opposing blocs" in the world.

    比诺为殖民政策诡辩
    并要求实现“欧洲统一”
    据新华社30日讯　巴黎消息：法国外交部长比诺28日晚发表了年终广播谈话。
    在这篇谈话中，比诺力图为法国对北非的殖民政策辩护。并竭力攻击埃及总统纳赛尔，说他“帮助”阿尔及利亚的“叛乱活动”，“用毁灭来威胁以色列和夺取苏伊士运河财产”。
    比诺在中东和匈牙利问题上重复了反苏的叫嚷；同时，又对联合国在英法侵略埃及事件上所采取的立场表示不满。
    比诺要求“实现欧洲的统一”。他说，最近几个月的事态，使法国政府相信现在比任何时候都有必要实现“欧洲的统一”。他认为，如果西欧国家不联合努力，它们迟早会被并入世界上对立的“两个集团之一”。
