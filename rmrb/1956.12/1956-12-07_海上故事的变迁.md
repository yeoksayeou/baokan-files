The Changing Story of the Sea
　　Quan Yimao
　　There is a small island in the Zhoushan Islands called Lujiazhi, and on the island, there is a temple. Legend has it that hundreds of years ago, a group of fishermen from Fujian went to the Zhoushan sea to fish and encountered the "Fog God" midway, the sea was a vast expanse, and they couldn't see their fingers. The fishermen were lost at sea, their water and food ran out, and they were on the verge of death. Just as they were dying, they suddenly saw a "divine light" not far away, flashing brightly in the distance. The fishermen set sail towards the light and found an oasis. To thank this "god" who pointed the way to those who were lost and in distress, they built a temple on this Lujiazhi Island to commemorate it forever. Since then, incense has burned continuously at the Lujiazhi Temple every year.
　　Many islands in the Zhoushan Islands have temples, and almost every temple has a beautiful myth, similar in content to the Lujiazhi Temple, telling stories of "sea gods protecting the people." This is not surprising. Before liberation, fishermen went out to sea to fish, always uncertain of their fate. There was a folk song circulating in the Zhoushan Islands:
　　The boat is separated by three inches of planks,
　　Inside the three inches is the mother's room,
　　Outside the three inches, you meet the King of Hell.
　　In order to avoid the tragic fate of being buried in the belly of the fish, fishermen often burned incense and prayed to the gods before going out to sea, and even made vows to "hang meat heart lamps," which was an extremely cruel superstitious act. Those who made the vow used a red-hot iron wire to pierce the skin and flesh of their arms, and then hung a lamp on the iron wire; some also hung a copper gong on the iron wire, and beat it in the streets during collective vows. Before liberation, I had seen people hanging meat heart lamps, and their painful expressions were truly heartbreaking.
　　These customs that had formed over a long period of time, these ignorant actions, could not save the fishermen from the tragic fate of being swallowed by the raging waves. Not long ago, when I went to Lujiazhi, I discovered that among the more than 600 fishing households on this island founded by the Lu family, only four households were surnamed Lu, and they were all adopted or bought, not direct descendants of the Lu family. An old fisherman in his seventies told me, "If you want to know the genealogy of the fishermen, please ask the Dragon King of the Sea."
　　Fishermen went out to sea with uncertain fates, so another custom formed in the Zhoushan Islands: men built their own living tombs (graves) when they were only in their twenties or thirties, and often ended up with "nine empty coffins out of ten," mostly ending up with cenotaphs because the unpredictable sea always took the fishermen and their corpses.
　　Today, these customs and habits of building temples, burning incense, hanging meat heart lamps, and even building living tombs no longer exist in the Zhoushan Islands; the myths and legends of the Lujiazhi Temple are only told with relish by the old fishermen when the younger generation asks about them. And new legends, new stories, have begun to circulate on the island, among which the story of the "Bodhisattva Boat" is more widely circulated.
　　In winter, during the peak season for hairtail, six fishermen from the Xiangshan Shipu Fishery Cooperative sailed two "small pair" boats north to the Shengsi sea. During the day, the sun shone brightly, and the sea glittered with golden light; at night, it was also calm and uneventful, and every net was a bountiful harvest, every cabin was full. One night, the boat boss and the fishermen were drinking and singing when suddenly a storm warning came from afar. The clever boss immediately set sail towards the Shengsi Islands, but in an instant, the storm arrived. They heard gusts of wind roaring from afar, hitting the waves several feet high, and the sea was a dark and chaotic scene. The boat body rose and fell back and forth in the raging waves, swaying from side to side, and huge waves crashed over the top of the boat. In less than a meal's time, the "small pair" boat had been washed to the north of Langgang Mountain. At this time, several fierce waves struck in the midst of the wind and rain, and they heard a "snap," the main mast on the boat was broken, the boat body spun around in the waves, seawater poured into the cabin in an instant, and it gradually tilted downward.
　　Just at the critical moment, a large boat, flashing bright lights, rode the wind and waves, rushed over, and rescued the "small pair" boat and the six fishermen from the dangerous situation.
　　Since then, the following song has appeared in the Zhoushan Islands:
　　Parents are good, parents are good,
　　The Communist Party is even better than parents;
　　Fishermen are afraid of storms at sea,
　　The "Bodhisattva Boat" runs all over the ocean;
　　When encountering a storm, send out a warning,
　　Rescuing the dying and healing the wounded is a great contribution.
　　It turned out that this "Bodhisattva Boat" was a "guiding fishing vessel" of the Zhoushan Fishery Command of the People's Government. Since it began its mission at sea in the winter of 1953, it has rescued dozens of fishing boats that encountered maritime hazards.
　　This year, the "Bodhisattva Boat" led more than a thousand pairs of "large pair" fishing boats from the Zhoushan Islands north to the Lusi Sea in northern Jiangsu, which Zhoushan fishermen had never dared to go to, and achieved an unprecedented harvest. The fishermen said:
　　"'Bodhisattva Boat' is not only a 'God of Peace,' but also a 'God of Wealth'!"

　　海上故事的变迁
　　全一毛
    舟山群岛有一个小岛叫鲁家峙，小岛上有一个庙。相传在好几百年以前，一群福建渔民到舟山洋面捕鱼，中途遇上“雾神”，大海一片茫茫，伸手不见五指。渔民在迷途中水尽粮断，奄奄一息。正在垂危的时候，突见不远处出现一盏
  “神灯”，在高处闪闪发光。渔民扬帆朝亮光驶来，果然见到一片绿洲。为了感谢这位向迷途遇险者指明方向的“天神”，他们就在这个鲁家峙岛上建造了一座庙宇，永志纪念。以后，鲁家峙庙年年香烟不绝。
    舟山群岛的许多岛上都有庙，而每座庙差不多都有一段优美的神话传说，其内容大抵跟鲁家峙庙相仿，说的都是“海神佑民”一类的故事。这也并不奇怪，解放以前，渔民出海打鱼，总是生死未卜。舟山群岛就流传着这样的民谣：
    船隔三寸板，
    三寸里面是娘房，
    三寸外面见阎王。
    渔民们为了想幸免葬身鱼腹的遭遇，每每在出海之前，烧香求神，甚至“吊肉心灯”许心愿，这是一种极为残忍的迷信举动。许愿的人用一根煨红了的铁丝，穿透自己胳膊的皮肉，然后在铁丝上挂一盏灯；也有在铁丝上挂一面铜锣的，在集体许愿时满街敲打。解放前，我曾见过吊肉心灯的人，其痛苦的表情，实在惨不忍睹。
    这些长时期形成的风尚，这些愚昧的举动，并不能挽救渔民们被惊涛骇浪吞噬的悲惨的命运。不久以前，我到鲁家峙去的时候，发现这个由鲁家创业的海岛上的六百多户渔民中，姓鲁的只剩下四户了，而且都是过继或买进的，并非鲁家的嫡系。一位七十多岁的老渔民对我说：“你想知道渔民家谱，请问海底龙王。”
    渔民出海生死未卜，于是在舟山群岛又形成了另一种习俗：男子才二、三十岁时，就造好了生圹寿域（坟墓），而临了常是“十口棺材九口空”，大多都落得个衣冠冢，因为变幻莫测的大海总是把渔民连尸体都夺去的。
    如今，这些建庙、烧香、吊肉心灯，以至造生圹寿域等等的风尚习俗，在舟山群岛已经不再存在了；鲁家峙庙的神话、传说，也只是在年青一辈探问时，老渔民才津津有味地说它一、二。而新的传说，新的故事，却开始在海岛上流传起来，其中流传得比较广泛的是关于“菩萨船”的故事。
    冬天，带鱼旺汛季节，象山石浦渔业社六个渔民，驾两只“小对”船，北上嵊泗洋面。白天，阳光普照，海上金光闪闪，晚上也平静无事，而且网网丰收，舱舱满载。一天夜里，船老大和渔工们正喝酒欢歌，突然从远处传来了暴风警报。机灵的老大立即扬帆向嵊泗列岛驶去，可是转瞬间暴风已到，但闻一阵阵呼啸自远而近，把那海浪打得几丈高，大海上一片昏天黑地。船身在惊涛骇浪中前后起伏，左右倾摆，巨浪直从船顶冲过。没一顿饭功夫，已把那“小对”船冲到浪岗山北。这时候在狂风暴雨中袭来几个猛浪，只听得“啪”的一声，船上主桅被折断了，船身在浪涛中团团打转，海水倾刻盈舱，渐渐倾斜下去。
    正当千钧一发之际，一条大船，闪着明亮灯光，乘风破浪，飞驰而来，把那“小对”船和六个渔民抢出险境。
    此后，舟山群岛就出现了这样的歌谣：
    爷娘好，爷娘好，
    共产党比爷娘还要好；
    渔民出海怕风暴，
      “菩萨船”满洋跑；
    遇上风暴放警报，
    救死扶伤功劳高。
    原来这条“菩萨船”是人民政府舟山渔场指挥部的一条“指导渔轮”，它从1953年冬天在海上执行任务以来，先后抢救了几十条遭遇海险的渔船。
    今年，“菩萨船”率领了舟山群岛一千多对“大对”渔船，北征舟山渔民从来不敢去的苏北吕泗洋，获得了空前的丰收。渔民们说：
  “‘菩萨船’不但是‘太平神’，还是
  ‘财神爷’呢！”
