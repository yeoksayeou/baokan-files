    If She's Mu Guiying, She Should Be Commander
    A certain section of the Yangquan Mining Bureau lacked several section chiefs and needed to promote from among the cadres. Three female comrades were relatively strong in their work ability, one of whom was called Mu Guiying because she was capable. However, when it came to promotions, they were not promoted. The leading cadres there said, "Even if Mu Guiying is capable, we can't let her be commander." The reason was: promoting female comrades to be section chiefs would hurt the self-esteem of male comrades.
    A thousand years ago, Mu Guiying was given command because she was talented. Today, our female cadres are capable of being section chiefs, but are deliberately not promoted. This is supposedly to avoid hurting the self-esteem of male comrades. Should the self-esteem of male comrades be built on suppressing the talents of female comrades? The principle of our Party and country in promoting cadres is "both moral integrity and ability," and there is no distinction between men and women. All leaders who find any excuse not to promote female cadres should examine their own thinking to see if there are remnants of feudal ideology at work.

    是穆桂英就应当挂帅
    阳泉市矿务局某处缺几个科长，需要从干部中提拔。有三位女同志工作能力都比较强，其中有一位女同志因为能干，人们称她为穆桂英。可是在提拔时，却没有提拔她们，那里的领导干部说：“穆桂英能干也不能叫她挂帅。”理由是：提拔女同志当科长，就要伤害男同志的自尊心。
    一千年前，穆桂英有才干就挂了帅。而今天我们的女干部能当科长，却硬不提拔，这样做，据说是怕伤害男同志的自尊心，难道男同志的自尊心就应当建立在压抑女同志才能的基础上吗？我们党和国家提拔干部的原则是“德才兼备”，并无男女之分。一切寻找任何借口不愿提拔女干部的领导人，都应当检查一下自己的思想，看看是否有封建思想残余在作怪。
