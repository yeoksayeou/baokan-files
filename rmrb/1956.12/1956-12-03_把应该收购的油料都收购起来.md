    Acquire All Oil-Bearing Crops That Should Be Acquired
    Commentator of this Newspaper
    Although this year's oil-bearing crop production plans were not fulfilled in some areas due to the impact of natural disasters, the total national output of oil-bearing crops has still increased compared to last year. However, from the time autumn oil-bearing crops entered the market until now, the national oil-bearing crop acquisition volume has decreased by 24.78% compared to the same period last year, which is nearly a quarter. During this same period, the supply of oils and fats increased by 34.20%, which is more than one-third. If this trend continues, it will cause the state's oil-bearing crop and oil balance to be lost, which will increase the difficulty of supplying non-staple foods, which will affect the lives of urban and rural people, and will be very detrimental to socialist construction.
    The reasons for the reduction in oil-bearing crop acquisition, in addition to the reduction in production due to disasters in some areas, are mainly the following: First, after the basic agricultural cooperativization, major changes have taken place in the distribution of oil-bearing crops in rural areas. Before the basic agricultural cooperativization, in order to encourage farmers to increase oil-bearing crop production, different supply standards were set according to the different conditions of farmers' oil-bearing crop production: surplus oil households received more, generally five to six jin; oil-deficient households received less, generally three to four jin. After agricultural cooperativization, the surplus and shortage of rural oil consumption were balanced by agricultural cooperatives. If it is an agricultural cooperative with a surplus of oil-bearing crop production, all members are allocated oil according to the standard of five to six jin. In this way, the standard of oil retention in rural areas has generally been raised, and the state's oil-bearing crop acquisition volume has decreased accordingly. Second, some agricultural cooperatives one-sidedly emphasized the development of sideline production for the cooperative and its members, retaining too much oil-bearing crops and failing to actively complete the task of selling oil-bearing crops to the state. Third, the leading organs in many places do not have a clear understanding of the significance of opening the free market led by the state. When they see some people raising prices to snap up oil-bearing crops and engaging in speculative resale activities, they do not come forward to stop them. Fourth, the acquisition departments in some places have many shortcomings in their acquisition work, such as violating the policy of pricing according to quality and suppressing grades and prices when acquiring oil-bearing crops; and the supply of oils and fats to oil-deficient households in rural areas is often not timely, and so on. This also hinders the enthusiasm of farmers to sell oil-bearing crops.
    Now is the season when autumn oil-bearing crops are entering the market in large quantities. The relevant departments in various regions should deeply recognize the serious impact of the aforementioned reasons on the oil-bearing crop acquisition work, and further take effective measures to acquire all the oil-bearing crops that should be acquired.
    The people's committees of each province should, based on the new situation after agricultural cooperativization, and on the basis of carefully verifying the output, appropriately adjust the rural oil retention standards, so that the farmers' oil retention volume and the state's oil-bearing crop acquisition volume continue to maintain a reasonable proportion.
    One of the important factors in completing the oil-bearing crop acquisition task is to conduct in-depth socialist education for farmers, so that they have a correct understanding of the relationship between the state's oil-bearing crop sales task and their own needs for oil. They must understand that completing the oil-bearing crop sales task, like completing the grain sales task, is of extremely great significance for supporting the country's socialist construction. This is both in line with the current interests of the farmers (because they can get reasonable prices) and in line with the long-term interests of the farmers (because guaranteeing the smooth and rapid progress of national construction is the highest interest of the farmers). Therefore, when agricultural cooperatives distribute oil-bearing crops, they should also follow the method of distributing grain: first complete the state-approved oil-bearing crop sales task, and then carry out internal distribution within the cooperative. Because some areas have reduced oil-bearing crop production this year due to disasters, agricultural cooperatives in oil-bearing crop surplus areas should, in the spirit of mutual support, sell more appropriately from the increased part to make up for the part that the state purchases less and sells more in disaster areas.
    Oil-bearing crops are state-monopolized purchase materials. During the period of monopolized purchase, agricultural cooperatives or individual farmers should not trade oil-bearing crops in the market. The market management departments must resolutely stop the behavior of raising prices to snap up oil-bearing crops and engaging in speculative resale. Once the oil-bearing crop monopolized purchase work is over, the oil market should be opened immediately to allow free transactions, in order to facilitate the adjustment of surpluses and shortages among farmers and reduce the difficulties in the state's oil supply.
    The business work of the acquisition department must be improved in a practical way. First of all, we must implement the policy of "pricing according to quality" and resolutely correct the phenomenon of suppressing grades and prices that damage the interests of farmers. We must resolutely change the practice of one-sided pricing by staff; we must consult with agricultural cooperatives and experienced farmers to realistically determine the quality difference standards for oil-bearing crop acquisition based on the state's price policy. For oil-deficient agricultural cooperatives (households), the supply quantity should be reasonably verified, and the supply certificates (tickets) should be issued to the oil-deficient households in a timely manner, and the supply should be carried out in stages according to the actual situation of oil deficiency.
    In order to ensure the timely and complete completion of the state's oil-bearing crop monopolized purchase task and appropriately maintain the oil production of existing oil mills in large and medium-sized cities, oil-bearing crops should basically be acquired during the monopolized purchase, rather than oil products. However, in order to take care of the needs of agricultural cooperatives (households) for oil cakes and help agricultural cooperatives develop sideline production, some of the oil-bearing crops supplied to the state for rural and market town use can be stored locally after acquisition and entrusted to local earthen oil workshops for processing. Individual agricultural cooperatives (households) can also, according to the needs of the actual situation and within the scope permitted by the state's oil-bearing crop acquisition plan, sell a part of oil products to complete the monopolized purchase task.

### 把应该收购的油料都收购起来

　　把应该收购的油料都收购起来
　　本报评论员
    今年虽然由于自然灾害的影响，一些地区的油料生产计划没有完成，但全国的油料总产量还是比去年增加了。可是，从秋季油料登场到现在，全国的油料收购数量却比去年同期减少了24.78％，即将近四分之一。在这同一时期，油脂的供应数量却增加了34.20％，即三分之一还多。这个趋势如果发展下去，就会使国家的油料油脂收支失掉平衡，就将增加副食品供应的困难，就会影响城乡人民的生活，对社会主义建设是很不利的。
    油料收购减少的原因，除了有些地区因灾减产以外，主要的有以下几个方面：第一，农业基本合作化以后，农村油料的分配发生了重大的变化。在农业基本合作化以前，为了鼓励农民增加油料生产，曾经按照农民生产油料的不同状况，规定了不同的供应标准：余油户多一些，一般为五至六斤；缺油户少一些，一般为三至四斤。农业合作化以后，农村用油以农业社为单位平衡余缺。如果是生产油料有余的农业社，所有社员都按照五至六斤的标准分配油料。这样，农村油料留量标准普遍提高，国家的油料收购数量相应地减少了。第二，有些农业社片面地强调发展社和社员的副业生产，过多地留存油料，没有积极完成向国家交售油料的任务。第三，不少地方的领导机关对于开放国家领导的自由市场的意义认识不清楚，看到某些人抬价抢购油料，进行投机贩卖的活动，也不出面制止。第四，有些地方的收购部门在收购工作上有不少缺点，例如：在收购油料的时候违反依质论价的政策，压级压价；对农村缺油户的油脂供应，往往也不及时，等等。这也妨害了农民交售油料的积极性。
    现在正是秋季油料大量登场的季节。各个地区的有关部门应该深刻认识前面说的各种原因给油料收购工作带来的严重影响，进一步采取有效措施，把应该收购的油料都收起来。
    各省人民委员会应当根据农业合作化以后的新情况，在认真地核实产量的基础上，对农村的油料留量标准适当地加以调整，使农民的油料留量同国家的油料收购数量，继续保持合理的比例。
    完成油料收购任务的重要因素之一，是对农民进行深入的社会主义教育，使他们对国家的油料交售任务和自己对油料需要的关系，有个正确的认识。要让他们懂得，完成油料交售任务，如同完成粮食交售任务一样，对于支持国家社会主义建设有着极其重大的意义，这是既符合农民的当前利益（因为他们可以得到合理的价款），也符合农民的长远利益的（因为保证国家建设顺利、迅速地进行，这是农民的最高利益）。因此，农业社在分配油料的时候，也应该仿照分配粮食的办法：首先完成国家核定的油料交售任务，然后进行社内分配。由于今年有些地区的油料因灾减产，油料丰产地区的农业社应该本着互相支援的精神，从增产部分当中，适当地多卖一些，以弥补国家在灾区少购多销的部分。
    油料是国家的统购物资，在统购期间，农业社或个体农民，都不应当在市场进行油料交易。市场管理部门对抬价抢购油料、进行投机贩卖的行为，必须坚决制止。油料统购工作一经结束，就应当立即开放油料市场，允许自由交易，以便利农民之间的有无调剂，减少国家油脂供应方面的困难。
    收购部门的业务工作要切实改进。首先要贯彻执行“依质论价”政策，坚决纠正损害农民利益的压级压价现象。要切实改变那种只由工作人员片面定价的作法；要同农业社和有经验的农民商量，根据国家的价格政策，实事求是地定出油料收购的品质差价标准。对于缺油的农业社（户），应当合理地核定供应数量，并把供应证（票）及时发到缺油户，按照缺油的实际情况，分期进行供应。
    为了保证按时如数完成国家的油料统购任务，适当地维持大、中城市现有油厂的油脂生产，在统购的时候，基本上应当收购油料，而不是收购油品。但是，为了照顾农业社（户）对油饼的需要，帮助农业社发展副业生产，对国家供应农村和集镇用油的一部分油料，在收购以后，可以就地保管，委托当地土榨油坊进行加工。个别的农业社（户）也可以按照实际情况的需要，在国家油料收购计划许可的范围之内，交售一部分油品，完成统购任务。
