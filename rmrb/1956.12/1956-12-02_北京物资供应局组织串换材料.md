Xinhua News Agency, December 1st. The Beijing Materials Supply Bureau has organized factories and construction sites throughout the city to mutually exchange steel, amounting to over two thousand tons since August.

　　This method of exchanging resources has enabled many units to obtain the steel they need, solving the difficulties of steel shortages in production and construction. For example, the Post and Telecommunications Building construction site lacked ribbed steel but had unsuitable round steel; while the General Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army directly affiliated Construction Engineering Company had ribbed steel but lacked round steel. After the two sides exchanged, both solved their engineering needs.

　　The Materials Supply Bureau conducted a comprehensive understanding of the unsuitable steel stored by various units and the types and specifications of steel needed, organizing multifaceted exchanges. Through the Materials Supply Bureau's organization of mutual exchange, the problem of many units lacking needed steel was solved. This type of exchange often extends to dozens of units. This exchange has now expanded from Beijing to factories and construction sites in other locations.

　　At the same time, the Beijing Materials Supply Bureau also organized the exchange of various other building materials. From August to the present, Beijing construction units have exchanged more than 5,600 radiator sections, more than 580 tons of cement, and more than 120 cubic meters of wood.

　　北京物资供应局组织串换材料
    新华社1日讯　北京市物资供应局组织全市工厂、工地互相调换钢材，从8月份到现在已经换了两千多吨。
    这种互通有无的办法已经使许多单位得到了所需用的钢材，解决了生产建设上缺乏钢材的困难。如邮电大楼工地缺乏螺纹钢，但有不合用的元钢；中国人民解放军总后勤部直属建筑工程公司却有螺纹钢，缺乏元钢，两方面互换以后都解决了工程上的需要。
    物资供应局对各单位储存的不合用的钢材和需要钢材的品种、规格情况，进行了全面了解，组织了多方面的交换。经过物资供应局从中组织互换，许多单位缺少所需钢材的问题就解决了。这种交换往往扩大到数十个单位。这种交换现在已经扩大到北京市同外埠的工厂、工地之间。
    与此同时，北京市物资供应局还组织了其它各种建筑材料的交换。8月份到现在北京各建筑单位之间已经交换了五千六百多片暖气炉片，五百八十多吨水泥，一百二十多立方公尺木材。
