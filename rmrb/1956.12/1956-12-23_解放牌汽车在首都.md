    Liberation Brand Automobiles in the Capital

    (Our Newspaper) News: A batch of "Liberation" brand automobiles, manufactured in our own country, and allocated to the Beijing Automobile Transportation Company, officially began participating in transportation work in the capital yesterday.

    A vehicle awarding ceremony was held before dispatch. The drivers entered the cabs with great excitement and slowly drove out of the lot. The loading and unloading workers who work with the trucks were just as happy as the drivers. They said: We have to be extra careful when loading and unloading, don't damage them! One new vehicle after another drove towards construction sites and warehouses amidst the cheers of the crowd. Along the way, they attracted traffic police and pedestrians, who all greeted and saw them off with joyful eyes. (Dou Xueyi)

    解放牌汽车在首都
    本报讯　分配给北京市汽车运输公司的一批我国自制的“解放”牌汽车，昨天正式开始参加首都的运输工作。
    出车前举行了授车典礼。司机们十分兴奋地进入驾驶室，慢慢地向场外开出。跟随汽车一起工作的装卸工人们，和司机一样的高兴。他们说：咱们装卸的时候得特别小心，别把它碰坏！一辆辆的新车，在人群的欢呼中开往工地、仓库。一路上，吸引着交通警察和行人，大家都用欣喜的眼光迎送着它们。（窦学义）
