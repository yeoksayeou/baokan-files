Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 8th: The experiment of using scrap white iron to smelt and regenerate grey cast iron has been successfully carried out in Jiangsu Province. The leading organization for the experiment was the Mechanical Industry Bureau of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry.

Objects commonly seen such as tripods, bells, scale weights, and soil plows are cast from white iron. Because this white iron has been recycled many times, it is brittle and hard, easily broken, and cannot be cut and processed to manufacture machines.

In July of this year, the Mechanical Industry Bureau of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry established an experimental research group to begin experimenting with smelting grey cast iron from white iron. After more than ten trials, they achieved success. The composition and properties of the regenerated grey cast iron are the same as ordinary grey cast iron.

Now, the Mechanical Industry Bureau of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry has compiled a set of operating procedures based on the technical summary of the trial smelting and small-scale production. They have also opened a training class at the Changzhou Machine Factory to organize technicians from machinery factories and iron factories throughout the province to learn the smelting method. After this training class ends, the method of smelting regenerated grey cast iron from white iron will be fully promoted.

　  白口铁炼再生灰生铁
    据新华社南京8日电　利用废旧的白口铁熔炼再生灰生铁的试验，已经在江苏省获得成功。领导试验工作的是江苏省工业厅机械工业局。
    人们常见的鼎、钟、秤锤、土犁等物件，就是用白口铁铸造的。这种白口铁因为经过多次回炉，性质脆硬，容易断裂，无法切削加工制造机器。
    今年7月间，江苏省工业厅机械工业局成立了试验研究小组，着手试验研究利用白口铁熔炼灰生铁，试炼了十多次，才获得成功。炼出的再生灰生铁的成分、性能，同普通灰生铁一样。
    现在，江苏省工业厅机械工业局已经根据试炼和小量生产的技术总结，整理了一套操作工艺规程，并且在常州机器厂开办了一个训练班，组织全省各地机械工厂和铁工厂的技术人员学习炼制方法。这个训练班结束以后，白口铁炼制再生灰生铁的方法将全面推广。
