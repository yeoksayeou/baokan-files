　　From Criticism to Praise
　　——How Jiangxi Province Solved the Problem of Non-Staple Food Supply——
  　By Our Reporter　Li Lianbin
    In the past two months, the work of non-staple food supply in Jiangxi Province has begun to improve, and the people in urban and rural areas are satisfied. Some people have even written to the governor to praise the improvement in commercial work.
    Two months ago, the situation was completely different: the supply of non-staple food was very tight, the masses were very dissatisfied, and all levels of commercial departments heard only criticism.
    From criticism to praise, this is an exciting and thought-provoking thing.
      In July, the Fifth Party Congress of Jiangxi Province studied and analyzed the problems existing in commercial work, including the tight supply of non-staple food. According to the spirit of the central instructions, the meeting pointed out that commercial departments need to adapt to the new market situation and improve their work. In early August, a provincial commercial work symposium was held, focusing on the new measures that should be taken under the new circumstances, and clearly proposed to open up the free market under state leadership. The specific content of opening the free market mainly includes: First, restoring farmers' trade; second, giving full play to the purchasing and sales power of small urban and rural vendors; and third, allowing local handicraftsmen to produce and sell their own products. The opening of the free market is carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. The open areas are expanded from points to areas, and the open varieties are increased from a few to many.
    Nanchang City was the first pilot area, and the free market was opened in early August. The first products to be opened were non-staple foods such as chickens, ducks, geese, fish, eggs, and vegetables. On the first day of the opening, there were not many people on the market. Some farmers were still holding a tentative attitude, bringing one or two chickens, or carrying a little vegetable to the market to sell. The next day, the third day, the situation was different. Groups of farmers carried baskets of chickens, baskets of eggs, and loads of vegetables to the market to sell. The quantity of non-staple food on the market increased, the variety increased, and the quality improved. Just looking at the fish supply: in the past, there were only a small amount of dead fish or even stinky fish on the market. Now there are batches of live fish and fresh fish. There are many varieties of fish, mainly mandarin fish, carp, crucian carp, bream, and eel. The amount of fish on the market has increased from one or two thousand catties to more than ten thousand catties per day, and it is still growing. In this way, consumers buy non-staple food; producers have profits, and their enthusiasm for production is greatly improved. Before the opening of the free market, farmers generally cut vegetables one day and pushed them to the contracted purchase department the next day. Now, they get up in the middle of the night to cut vegetables and send them to the market to meet buyers before the sun rises. The turnover of small vendors has generally expanded by one or two times, and some have expanded even more.
    Subsequently, Jingdezhen, Ganzhou, Jiujiang, Shangrao and other cities opened free markets under state leadership, and farmer trade markets were established in major market towns. According to incomplete statistics, more than 300 farmer trade markets have been established in the province. Each county seat in Jiujiang Prefecture has established a free market and established a free market management committee; Leping County in Shangrao Prefecture has established eight farmer trade markets; An Yuan County in Gannan Administrative Region has opened free markets in each market town. After the opening of the free market, the problem of non-staple food supply in various towns and cities in the province has been basically solved. Taking Dongshanba market town in Shishang District, Ningdu County, as an example, the amount of ducks on the market has increased by two times, eggs have increased by one time, and the amount of other non-staple foods on the market has also increased. Jingdezhen has 3,000 to 4,000 catties of fresh fish on the market every day, and non-staple foods such as ducks and chickens have also met the current needs. Of course, the reason for the increase in the amount of non-staple food on the market is mainly due to the arrival of the peak season for agricultural and sideline production; but the opening of the free market has played a positive role in stimulating production and promoting the exchange of materials.
    In the process of opening the free market under state leadership, the party and government leading departments and commercial leading departments of Jiangxi Province mainly carried out the following tasks in the leadership and management of the market:
    First, grasp prices. At the beginning of the opening of each free market, the prices of general commodities were generally high, but after three or four days, the number of commodities on the market increased, and the prices gradually became normal. Each free market posted price tags for various non-staple foods, so that buyers and sellers knew what to expect and the prices would not be too high or too low. However, price tags alone are not enough, and price negotiations should be organized at any time according to the production and sales situation. As for some non-staple foods that are in short supply, another market price often appears when they are sold on the market. In this way, one commodity may have three prices in one market: the tagged price, the negotiated price, and the market price. The responsibility of the commercial department is to pay close attention to price changes and organize commodity supply or purchase in a timely manner. When a certain commodity is in short supply and the price is too high, the commercial department must organize sources of goods, organize transportation and sales, and regulate supply; when a certain commodity is in oversupply and the price is too low, state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives need to purchase at appropriate prices, or find ways to solve the problem of commodity sales, so as to avoid excessive losses to producers. For example, radishes are currently on the market in large quantities. The amount on the market is very large. In Nanchang City, you can buy five or six catties for one dime. In the producing area, you can buy one catty for a few cents. For products like this, the state commercial department is unable to purchase all of them, so it mobilizes farmers to process them themselves and make dried radishes for sale, so as not to affect the production of radishes in the coming year. As for some products whose purchase prices are too low as stipulated by the state, it is necessary to appropriately adjust them in order to stimulate production and prevent long-distance transportation and sales.
    Second, strengthen the administrative management of the market. Ban "second dealers" and black households engaged in speculation and profiteering in the market; stop bad behaviors such as adulteration, selling bad goods, and short weights and measures in the market; and correct phenomena that violate tax laws and betray contracts. Strengthen the organizational leadership and business leadership of joint state-private stores, cooperative stores, and cooperative groups, and avoid and reduce phenomena that may be unfavorable to the healthy development of the free market.
    Third, organize the combination of production and sales in a planned way, so that producers have a bottom line and the supply of non-staple food in cities is more guaranteed. Nanchang City and more than 20 counties in Nanchang Prefecture held a production and sales combination meeting and signed a production and sales combination contract worth 6.4 million yuan, which not only solved the sales of agricultural and sideline products, but also guaranteed the supply of non-staple food in cities. At present, this work will be promoted throughout the province. It is planned to hold production and sales balance meetings in cities, counties, or districts, and hold local specialty exhibitions and material exchange meetings in cities or primary markets, so that farmers know what the market needs and find directions for developing production.
    At present, in most towns and cities in Jiangxi Province, except for commodities such as pork and edible oil whose production is insufficient and supply is still somewhat tight, the supply problem of other non-staple foods has been solved to a certain extent. I believe that with the efforts of the party and government leading organs and all commercial workers in Jiangxi Province, and on the basis of further improvement in the production enthusiasm of the masses, the work of non-staple food supply in Jiangxi Province will be further improved.

　　从责难到称赞
　　——江西省解决副食品供应问题的经过——
  　本报记者　李连斌
    近两个月来，江西省副食品供应工作开始有了好转，城乡人民都表示满意。有的人还给省长写信，称赞商业工作有了改进。
    两个月以前，情况完全不同：副食品供应十分紧张，群众非常不满，各级商业部门听到的只是责难。
    从责难到称赞，这是一件令人兴奋也发人深思的事情。
      7月间，江西省第五次党代表大会对商业工作中存在的问题，包括副食品供应紧张的问题，进行了研究和分析，根据中央指示的精神，会议指出商业部门需要适应市场的新形势改进工作。8月初，召开了全省商业工作座谈会，着重研究了在新情况下应该采取的新措施，明确地提出了要开放国家领导下的自由市场。开放自由市场的具体内容主要是：一、恢复农民的贸易；二、充分发挥城乡小商贩的购销力量；三、允许地产地销的手工业者自产自销。自由市场的开放是有计划、有步骤地进行的。开放的地区由点到面，开放的品种从少到多。
    南昌市是第一个试验点，在8月初就开放了自由市场。开放的品种首先是鸡、鸭、鹅、鱼、蛋和蔬菜等副食品。开放的第一天，上市的人不多，有些农民还是抱着试探性的态度，提一两只鸡，或担一点蔬菜到市场上出卖。第二天，第三天，情况就不同了，成群结队的农民背着成篓的鸡、提着成篮的蛋、挑着成担的菜到市场上来卖。副食品上市的数量增加了，品种增加了，质量提高了。这里仅就鱼的供应情况来看：过去上市的只有少量死鱼、甚至臭鱼，现在有成批的活鱼、鲜鱼，鱼的品种很多，主要的有桂鱼、鲤鱼、鲫鱼、边鱼、鳝鱼等；鱼的上市量，每日由过去的一两千斤增加到一万多斤，并且还在增长。这样，消费者买到了副食品；生产者有利可图，生产积极性大大提高。开放自由市场之前，一般农民都是头一天砍菜，第二天推到包销部门来卖。现在，半夜就起来砍菜，太阳还没出山的时候就把菜送到市场上和购买者见面了。小商贩的营业额一般的都扩大了一两倍，有的扩大得更多。
    接着，景德镇、赣州、九江、上饶等城市都开放了国家领导下的自由市场，并在各主要墟镇设立了农民贸易市场。据不完全统计，现在全省共设立了三百多个农民贸易市场。九江专区各县县城都设立了自由市场，成立了自由市场管理委员会；上饶专区乐平县建立了八个农民贸易市场；赣南行政区安远县各墟镇都开放了自由市场。自由市场开放以后，全省各城镇的副食品供应问题基本上解决了。以宁都县石上区东山坝集镇为例，鸭的上市量增加两倍，鸡蛋增加一倍，其他副食品上市量也有增加。景德镇每日上市鲜鱼达三、四千斤，鸭、鸡等副食品也满足了当前的需要。当然，副食品上市量增多的原因，主要是农副业生产旺季到来；但自由市场的开放，却起了刺激生产、促进物资交流的积极作用。
    在开放国家领导下的自由市场的过程中，江西省的党政领导部门和商业领导部门对市场的领导和管理主要进行了以下几项工作：
    一、掌握价格。各个自由市场，在开放之初，一般商品的价格都偏高，但过三四天以后，上市的商品增多了，价格也就渐渐趋向正常。各个自由市场对各种副食品都挂出了牌价，这样使买者和卖者心中有数，使物价不致过高或过低。但是，只有牌价还不够，还要随时根据产销情况组织议价。至于某些供不应求的副食品，在市场上出售的时候往往还会出现另一个市价。这样，一种商品在一个市场上可能有三种价格：牌价，议价，市价。商业部门的责任就在于密切注意价格的变化，及时组织商品供应或收购。当某种商品供不应求价格过高的时候，商业部门就要组织货源，组织运贩，调剂供应；当某种商品供过于求、价格过低的时候，国营商业部门和供销合作社就需要按照适当价格收购，或者是设法解决商品的销售问题，以免生产者受到过大的损失。如萝卜目前正是大量上市季节，上市量很大，在南昌市一角钱可买五、六斤，在产区，几厘钱就可买到一斤。类似这样的产品，国家商业部门无力全部收购，于是就发动农民自己加工，制成萝卜干出售，以免影响来年萝卜的生产。至于国家规定的某些产品收购价格过低的，为了刺激生产和防止远距离运销，需要适当加以调整。
    二、加强市场的行政管理工作。取缔市场上的“二贩子”和投机倒把的黑户；制止市场上出现的掺杂掺假、卖坏货、少尺短秤等恶劣行为；纠正那些违反税法、背弃合同的现象。对公私合营商店、合作商店、合作小组加强组织领导和业务领导，避免和减少了可能发生的不利于自由市场健康发展的现象。
    三、有计划地组织产销结合，使生产者有底，使城市副食品供应更有保证。南昌市和南昌专区等二十余县举办了产销结合会议，签订了价值六百四十万元的产销结合合同，这既解决了农副业产品的销路，也保证了城市副食品的供应。目前这个工作将在全省范围内推行，计划以市、县或区为单位召开产销平衡会议，在城市或初级市场上举办土特产展览会、物资交流会等，使农民知道市场上需要什么，找到发展生产的方向。
    现在，江西省的大部分城镇，除猪肉、食油等生产不足的商品供应还有些紧张以外，其它副食品供应问题已经在一定程度上解决了。我相信，在江西省党政领导机关和全体商业工作人员的努力下，在群众生产积极性进一步提高的基础上，江西省副食品供应工作将会更加好转。
