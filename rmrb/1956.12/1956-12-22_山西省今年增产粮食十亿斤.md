    山西省今年增产粮食十亿斤
    据新华社太原21日电　据山西省农业厅宣布，今年山西省粮食总产量达到了八十六亿七千万斤，比丰收的1953年提高15％，比去年增产十亿斤。全省粮食产量已经接近完成1957年的指标，其中一千八百多万亩小麦产量已经超过1957年的指标。
    山西省今年有相当一部分地区曾经连续发生各种自然灾害，各地农业社的灾前预防、灾中抢救、灾后生产自救的规模是空前的，效果也很好。各地农业社曾经战胜了在九百多万亩耕地上发生的风、雹、洪、涝等灾害，还在五百多万亩田禾间除治了各种病虫害。
    随着农业合作化，各地水利建设和农业技术改革工作，也有了很大的发展。各地出现了许多获得大面积丰产和高额产量的农业社。
