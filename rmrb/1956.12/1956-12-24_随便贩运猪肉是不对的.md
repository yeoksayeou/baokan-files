    Arbitrary Trafficking of Pork is Wrong
    Since the opening of the free market in Hanjiang County, Jiangsu Province, the phenomenon of small vendors trafficking pork has become very serious.

    At the Yangzhou Wharf, small vendors traffic pork every day, with about ten live pigs being transported out each day. A small vendor named Zhou Yuanliang once wanted to transport three live pigs to Shanghai for sale. The Shuangmiao Township People's Committee gave him a "self-produced and self-sold" certificate, and the tax office also taxed him. Some private merchants raised prices to抢购 (scramble to purchase) live pigs that the state had already ordered from farmers. Some agricultural cooperatives are also trafficking large quantities of live pigs for sale. The Lianer Agricultural Cooperative of Feijiaqiao in Yunxi Township opened its own butcher shop, slaughtering two or three pigs every day, without a business license and without paying taxes. This has greatly affected the pork purchasing task of the Hanjiang County Food Company. The company purchased 638 live pigs in September but only 245 in November.

    The leading organs of Hanjiang County should strengthen their leadership over the free market and clearly define the scope of goods that can be freely traded. Ji Wanlin

    On November 30th, the Xiangjiang Steamer No. 2002 was moored at Changshaba (i.e., Tangyuanshi) in Qingxi District, Fuling County, Sichuan Province. In the evening, several crew members from the ship went to Changsha Village in Changshaba to privately purchase more than ten live pigs. They offered very high prices, 0.32 yuan per jin for live pigs, and up to 0.34 yuan, far exceeding the local purchasing price of the food company. They also hired small boats to ferry the pigs to the steamer to slaughter them themselves. Xiong Chengyu, the head of an agricultural cooperative in Changsha Village, advised them not to do so. They distorted the policy on opening up the free market, saying, "The state stipulates that free trade is allowed, and no one can interfere." They also asked members of the agricultural cooperative to search for domestic poultry for them during production time.

    Some farmers, seeing that their purchase price was high, were unwilling to sell live pigs to the state, which affected the completion of the state's purchasing task. Xia Qingquan

### 随便贩运猪肉是不对的

    随便贩运猪肉是不对的
    江苏省邗江县在开放自由市场以后，小商贩贩运猪肉的现象很严重。
    扬州轮船码头每天有小商贩贩运猪肉，一天约有十头生猪被运出去。小商贩周元亮，有一次要运三头生猪到上海销售，双庙乡人民委员会给他“自产自销”的证明，税务所也给他报了税。有的私商抬价抢购国家已向农民订购的生猪。有些农业社也在大量贩运生猪出售。运西乡费家桥联二农业社自开肉铺，每天宰猪二、三头，既没有营业牌照，又不报税。邗江县食品公司的生猪收购任务因此受到很大影响。该公司9月收购生猪六百三十八头。11月只收购了二百四十五头。
    邗江县领导机关，应加强对自由市场的领导，明确规定可以自由买卖的商品的范围。　纪万林
    11月30日，湘江轮船二○○二号船，停泊在四川涪陵县清溪区长沙坝（即汤元石）。晚上，船上几个工作人员，就跑到长沙坝的长沙村私自购买生猪十余头。他们出的价格很高，活猪每斤三角二分，最高达三角四分，远超过食品公司在当地的收购价。他们还雇小船把猪渡到轮船上自己宰杀。长沙村一个农业社社长熊成余劝他们不要这样做。他们反曲解关于开放自由市场的政策，说：“国家规定可以自由买卖，谁也不能干涉。”他们还要农业社社员在生产时间给他们搜罗家禽。
    一些农民，见他们的收购价高，不愿把生猪卖给国家，影响国家收购任务完成。　夏庆全
