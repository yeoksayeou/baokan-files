　　Self-Run, Publicly Assisted Sanatorium
　　Hai Qing
　　In Lushun, from Golden Beach to Silver Mountain, there is a piece of land jutting out into the sea, shaped like an old sow. People call it Old Sow Reef. The front of the peninsula is the vast ocean, and the back is rolling mountains and dense forests. The scenery there is beautiful, with plenty of sunshine and fresh air...
　　Right in this place, from April of this year, a self-run, publicly assisted, simple sanatorium for tuberculosis patients was established.
　　As early as the end of March this year, Jiang Renzhang and Li Changjiang from the Lushun 401 Factory, Dong Liyong from the Lushun Printing Factory, and Wang Qingmao from the Lushun Iron Factory gathered to discuss the issue of recuperation. All four of them were tuberculosis patients, and they had gotten to know each other and formed friendships during their long-term medical treatment. When they talked about recuperation, they shared a common problem: - the lack of a quiet place.
　　They were recuperating at home according to the labor insurance regulations, with the state covering their medical expenses and also paying their wages, which they deeply appreciated. However, home life was not peaceful; the children were noisy, and they were worried about infecting their family members. They knew that the country was in a period of construction and could not spend more money to build large-scale sanatoriums to allow all tuberculosis patients to recuperate there for a long time. How could they recover well and contribute to construction? This was what troubled them.
　　After discussing the issue, Jiang Renzhang came up with a solution: find a house in a quiet place by the sea and have the four of them live together, going to the hospital for treatment regularly. Wouldn't that be great? Everyone agreed with this idea, and they found this place at Old Sow Reef.
　　There is a small fishing village here, inhabited by more than thirty fishing families. At the far east end of the village, there are five isolated houses. Only two elderly people lived in one of them; the seventy-year-old woman said, "Come on over, we'll give you two and a half rooms!" So the four of them moved their bedding over. Their respective factories subsidized their rent and part of their food expenses, and also helped them whitewash the rooms. Each person brought some odds and ends from their homes, and they managed to put together quite a complete set. Jiang Renzhang even brought a radio from home. The four of them pooled their money to buy playing cards. The room was both neat and clean, and simple and unadorned.
　　The four of them took turns carrying water and cooking. Among them, the printing worker Dong Liyong was very skillful, cooking dishes in many different ways and with great flavor. Their non-staple foods were mainly obtained locally. The fishermen in the village cared about them, selling them fresh fish and shrimp they caught, and also supplying them with fresh eggs. There were dairy farmers in the village who sent them milk every day. They ate eggs in the morning and drank milk at night. With soup and vegetables, their meals were both cheap and nutritious. More importantly, the environment there was good. Usually, they could go to the hills to sunbathe, go fishing by the sea...
　　After living there for more than a month, the news of their recuperation here was learned by ten tuberculosis-stricken workers from the Lushun Garment Factory, who also wanted to join them. With the assistance of local fishermen, they rented another four bungalows. The factory also installed new panes of glass for them, bought them two tons of coal, and allocated to them the utensils from a former canteen that had been closed down. The Industry Section of the Lushun Municipal People's Committee also transferred a sixty-year-old master chef to help them cook. Fan Yinghua and Tian Zhiyun from the Garment Factory were female workers, so the comrades who were originally recuperating there voluntarily exchanged their housing with them, giving them a separate room.
　　With more people, they automatically held a meeting and elected a director, a finance committee member, and a food committee member, forming a management organization. Yue Weibin, who came from the Garment Factory, was an old worker who was good at uniting the masses and caring for everyone. Everyone elected him as the director. Wang Qingmao became the finance committee member.
　　With more people, the recuperation life became more active. Some people brought accordions, erhus, chess sets, and other recreational items from their homes, and some factories also sent books and picture magazines. Gao Yuzheng, a worker at the Lushun Garment Factory, had his father pass away, leaving behind a small fishing boat. Gao Yuzheng also brought it here for everyone to row around in the sea. In June, the Lushun Municipal People's Committee sent three more cadres here to recuperate, and allocated a bicycle for everyone to use. The Lushun Municipal Grain and Non-Staple Food Supply Department also cared about them, supplying them with the best rice and flour, and supplying them with a certain amount of pork.
　　In the morning, they walked along the beach, did exercises, or jogged, according to the severity of their illnesses. After meals, according to their own preferences, they went fishing on the rocks, boating by the sea, playing the accordion in the woods, or playing chess and cards, and reading in the shade of the trees or indoors...
　　In this self-run, publicly assisted simple sanatorium, there were no specially appointed doctors and nurses. The patients were regularly diagnosed and treated at the Dalian Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Hospital and the Lushun Municipal Hospital. Under the guidance of the medical staff there, they learned some knowledge about hygiene, exercise, and diet. In this simple sanatorium, in just a few months, six or seven people have been proven by hospital examinations to have recovered and returned to their jobs. Gu Yuanjiang, a tailoring worker from the Garment Factory, returned to the factory last month, and many people hardly recognized him. In the past, he was as skinny as a skeleton, but now he is fat and strong. Li Changjiang had been ill for several years. This time, he recovered and returned to the factory. People didn't believe he had recovered so quickly. He showed people the hospital examination certificate, and everyone was happy for his recovery!

### 自办公助的疗养所

　　自办公助的疗养所
　　海清
    在旅顺市，从黄金台到白银山的海滨，有一块地方突出在海面上，形状像只老母猪，人们管它叫老母猪礁。半岛的前面是汪洋大海，背后是起伏的山岭和茂密的树林。那里景色美丽，阳光充足，空气新鲜……
    就在这个地方，从今年4月起成立了一个自办公助的、简易的肺结核疗养所。
    还在今年3月底，旅顺四○一工厂的姜仁章和李长江，旅顺印刷厂的董立永以及旅顺铁工厂的王庆茂四个人聚在一起谈论养病的问题。他们四个都是肺结核患者，在长期医疗过程中，彼此相识并建立了友谊。谈起养病问题，他们有共同的苦恼：——没有一个安静的地方。
    他们是按照劳动保险条例在家休养的，国家负担医药费用，还发给他们工资，这些都使他们深深感激。可是在家生活不安静，孩子们吵吵闹闹的，又耽心家里亲人受传染。他们知道国家处在建设时期，不可能花更多的钱大规模地盖疗养院，让所有的肺结核患者都到里边去长期休养。究竟怎样养好病去从事建设呢？这就是他们感到苦恼的事情。
    四个人谈来谈去，最后，姜仁章想出一个办法，到海边安静地方，找一所房子，四人住在一处，定期到医院去治疗，这不是很好吗。大家都同意了这个意见，就在老母猪礁找到了这个处所。
    这里有一个小小的渔村，居住着三十多户渔民。村子顶东头孤零零的有五间房子，这一家只有两位老人，七十多岁的老太太说：“你们来吧，给你们两间半房！”四个人就把铺盖卷拉去了。各人的厂子里都补助他们房租费和一部分伙食费，还帮他们粉刷了屋子。每个人从自己家里带了些零星用具，凑的挺齐全，姜仁章还从家里带来一架收音机，四个人又搭伙买了扑克，屋子里搞的既整齐清洁，又简单朴素。
    他们四个人轮流挑水做饭，其中印刷工人董立永非常巧，做的饭菜花样多，味道好。他们的副食品主要是就地取材，村子里渔民关怀他们，打到鲜鱼大虾就卖给他们，还供应他们新鲜的鸡子。村子里有饲养奶牛的，还每天给他们送牛奶。他们早上冲鸡子吃，晚上喝牛奶。有汤、有菜，他们的伙食又便宜又富有营养。更重要的是那里环境好，平常他们可以随意到山场上去晒太阳，去海滨钓鱼……。
    住了一个多月，他们在这里疗养的消息，被旅顺被服厂十名患肺结核的职工知道了，也要参加到这里来。在当地渔民协助下，又租了四间平房，厂里还新安了几块玻璃，给他们买了两吨煤，把过去撤销的一个食堂的用具拨给他们用。旅顺市人民委员会工业科又调了一位六十岁的大师傅来帮他们做饭。被服厂的范英花和田芝云是女工，于是原先在那疗养的同志就主动地跟她们调换了住屋，让她们单独有个房间。
    人多了，他们自动开了个会，选出了所长、财务委员、伙食委员，成立了管理机构。被服厂来的岳维宾，是个善于团结群众关心大家的老工人，大伙选他当了所长。王庆茂当了财务委员。
    人多了，疗养生活也更活跃了。有人从家里带来了手风琴和二胡、象棋等文娱用品，有些厂子还送来图书画报。旅顺被服厂工人高玉正的父亲去世了，留下一条小渔船，高玉正也把它划到这儿来，供大家在海滨划着玩。6月份，旅顺市人民委员会又送三名干部到这儿来疗养，并拨了一辆自行车来，大伙有事好骑骑。旅顺市粮食和副食品供应部门也很关怀他们，供应他们最好的大米、白面，供应他们一定数量的猪肉。
    早晨，他们按照自己疾病的轻重，分别在海滨散步、作操或是小跑步。饭后根据自己的爱好，去岩石上钓鱼，去海边划船，去树林里拉手风琴，去树荫下或在屋里走象棋、打扑克、看书……。
    在这个自办公助的简易的疗养所里，没有专设的大夫和护士。疗养员们都在旅大肺结核防治院和旅顺市立医院定期诊治。在那里的医务人员指导下，他们学到了一些卫生、运动、饮食等方面的知识。在这个简朴的疗养所里短短的几个月，已经有六、七个人经过医院检查证明痊愈回到工作岗位了。被服厂裁活工人谷元江，上个月就回到工厂，好多人几乎不认识他了，过去他瘦成骨头架子，现在又胖又结实了。李长江是个病了好几年的人了，这回痊愈回到工厂，人们不相信他好得这么快，他把医院检查证明拿给人们看，大伙都为他恢复健康而高兴！
