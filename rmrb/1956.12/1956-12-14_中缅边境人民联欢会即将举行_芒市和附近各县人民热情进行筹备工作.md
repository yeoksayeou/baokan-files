Red flags are fluttering everywhere on the streets, and the various agencies and schools of Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture are building arches; slogans such as "Welcome Burmese Friends" are hung on the arches that have already been built. Residents are cleaning their homes neatly and cleanly. The newly built guest house and reception building are ready to welcome Burmese federal leaders and officials from the Shan and Kachin States. The plaza for the friendship gathering has also been completed. Dai workers have planted banana trees, Manshanpo trees, banyan trees and pines around the pool at the western end of the plaza. Staff for the friendship gathering are busily arranging exhibits related to industry, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, culture and education, and health within the prefecture. Hundreds of tons of supplies for the gathering have been transported here. Department stores, trade companies, and medicine companies have prepared a variety of goods for the Chinese and Burmese border people. Welfare companies have specially opened restaurants, barber shops, photo studios and tea houses for the border people of the two countries, which will soon be open for business.

As early as ancient times, it was one of the roads connecting China to Burma, and had close economic and cultural ties with Burma.
