Xinhua News Agency, December 13th, TASS Cairo, December 13th: According to the "Al-Ahram" newspaper, the Egyptian army has completed the construction of a pontoon bridge over the Suez Canal in the Kantara area.
    Egyptian engineering units have entered the east bank of the canal and are now clearing mines laid by the Israeli army during its withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula. The engineers are rebuilding the railway blown up by the Israeli army and erecting new telephone lines.
    Xinhua News Agency, December 13th, Cairo News: The Egyptian "People's Daily" reported on December 12th that the work of clearing obstacles in the Suez Canal will begin on the 21st. The newspaper pointed out: "On this day, the last enemy soldier will leave Port Said."
    On the same day, the UN-appointed representative in charge of supervising the clearing of the canal, U.S. officer Wheeler, said in Port Said that the UN's salvage fleet was prepared to begin clearing obstacles in the canal within ten days. He said that the clearing work could not begin until the Anglo-French forces had completely withdrawn.
    Wheeler arrived in Port Said on the 11th to investigate the situation at the port and the canal entrance. At a press conference, he declined to say whether the UN would use Anglo-French salvage equipment, but he said that he had not made such a recommendation.
    Xinhua News Agency, December 13th, New York News: According to a report on the 11th by a "Al-Ahram" reporter in Cairo, he learned from reliable UN sources that UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld did not agree with the demand made by Britain and France to him last weekend insisting on using Anglo-French salvage equipment to clear the canal.
    The news said that Hammarskjöld notified the British and French representatives to the United Nations on the 11th that he would hand over this request to Wheeler, who is in charge of the UN's canal clearing plan to decide. Hammarskjöld also said that he believed that Egypt would never allow British and French "technicians" to participate in the work of clearing the canal.
    Reports say that Britain's Dixon and France's Broustra said they "do not intend to give up their demands."

    同一天，联合国任命的负责监督清理运河的代表、美国军官惠勒在塞得港说，联合国的打捞沉船的船队准备在十天之内在运河开始清除障碍的工作。他说，清除工作在英法军队完全撤出以前不能开始。
    惠勒在11日到塞得港调查这个港口以及运河入口处的情况，他在记者招待会上拒绝说明联合国是否会使用英法的打捞装备，但是，他说，他没有作过这种建议。
    新华社13日讯　纽约消息：据开罗“金字塔报”记者11日报道，他从可靠的联合国人士方面获悉，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德不同意英法两国在上周末向他提出的坚持用英法的打捞设备来清理运河的要求。
    消息说，哈马舍尔德在11日通知英法驻联合国的代表说，他将把这一要求交给负责联合国清理运河计划的惠勒去决定。哈马舍尔德还说，他认为埃及决不会允许英法的“技术人员”来参加清理运河的工作。
    有消息说，英国的狄克逊和法国的布鲁斯特拉说，他们“不打算放弃他们的要求。”
