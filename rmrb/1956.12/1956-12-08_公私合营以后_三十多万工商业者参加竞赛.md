Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch. Participating in socialist competition has now become an effective way for the vast number of industrialists and businessmen to contribute to the socialist cause and transform themselves.

    By the third quarter, over 140,000 industrialists and businessmen in seven cities including Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan, Xi'an, Shenyang, and Nanjing had participated in the socialist competition. Of the more than 80,000 private individuals in Shanghai's public-private joint ventures, over 45,000 participated in the competition. In Wuhan, the industrial and commercial circles launched the "Meritorious Service for Socialism" campaign, and more than 14,000 of the city's 20,000 industrialists and businessmen have joined this movement. In Jiangxi, Fujian, Hebei, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Heilongjiang and other provinces, a total of 170,000 people participated in the competition. They generally set out competition conditions or guarantees based on their own work situations.

    In these provinces and cities, over 40,000 industrialists and businessmen have achieved good results or made special contributions in the competition, and have been rated as advanced producers or advanced workers by their enterprises, or have received awards or commendations from enterprises, specialized companies, or federations of industry and commerce. In Harbin, eleven private individuals from joint ventures were awarded honorary certificates by the Municipal People's Committee in August. In Sichuan Province, ten private individuals from joint ventures attended the province's first representative meeting of advanced workers in the finance, grain, and trade system. Zhuzhou in Hunan Province and Zhengzhou, Xinxiang, Nanyang and other cities and counties in Henan Province have successively held representative meetings of advanced workers in industrial and commercial circles to exchange experiences. In September, the industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai held a city-wide experience exchange conference on socialist competition.

    Among the industrialists and businessmen who have received honorary titles or awards, some have made significant contributions in increasing production, improving quality, and developing new designs and varieties, some have made new creations and inventions, some have provided excellent service, and some have disclosed technical secrets of many years, which has greatly helped to improve the professional level of their colleagues. Wu Jincui, deputy director of Beijing Yushengxiang Electric Motor Factory and a private individual, and his younger brother successfully manufactured an absorption refrigerator for use on trains to eliminate the smog in the driver's cab and lower the temperature in the driver's cab when the train passes through tunnels, which can improve the driver's operating efficiency and protect the driver's health. This refrigerator has been tested by the railway department and has proven to be effective, and is now in production. Zhang Songpo, a young private individual from Shanghai Guanghua Optical Factory, has successfully trial-produced medical devices such as cystoscopes, ureteroscopes, corneal microscopes, and nasopharyngoscopes this year, which have never been manufactured in China before. Cao Yunting, a private individual from Wuhan Xinji Hotel, was praised dozens of times by passengers for her good service attitude and was rated as an advanced worker in Wuhan. Many people in Wuhan's industrial and commercial circles have called for learning from her. Some industrialists and businessmen have also corrected undesirable business practices and learned new labor skills in the competition.

    公私合营以后
　　三十多万工商业者参加竞赛
    新华社7日讯　参加社会主义竞赛，目前已经成为广大工商业者为社会主义事业贡献力量和改造自己的有效办法。
    到第三季度，上海、北京、天津、武汉、西安、沈阳、南京等七个城市，有十四万多名工商业者参加了社会主义竞赛。上海市公私合营企业中的八万多名私方人员，有四万五千多人参加了竞赛。武汉市工商界展开“为社会主义立功”运动，全市二万多名工商业者中已有一万四千多人投入这个运动。江西、福建、河北、山西、浙江、黑龙江等省，参加竞赛的共达十七万人。他们一般根据自己的工作情况，订出了竞赛条件或保证。
    在这些省、市中，有四万多名工商业者在竞赛中获得良好的成绩或作出了特殊的贡献，被企业评为先进生产者或先进工作者，或者得到了企业、专业公司或工商业联合会的奖励或表扬。哈尔滨有十一名合营企业的私方人员，在8月份得到市人民委员会授予的荣誉奖状。四川省还有十名合营企业的私方人员，出席了这个省的第一届财政、粮食、贸易系统先进工作者代表会议。湖南省株州和河南省郑州、新乡、南阳等市县，先后召开了工商界先进工作者代表会议，交流了经验。上海市工商界在9月份举行了全市性的社会主义竞赛经验交流大会。
    获得荣誉称号或奖励的工商业者中，有的在提高产量、质量和改进花色品种方面有重大的贡献，有的有新创造和发明，有的服务态度良好，有的公开了多年的技术秘密，对提高同业人员的业务水平有较大的帮助。北京裕生祥电机厂副厂长、私方人员吴金萃和他的弟弟，制造成功火车上用的吸收式冷冻机，在火车通过隧道时，用以排除司机室内的烟雾和降低司机室内的温度，可以使司机提高操作效率，保护司机的健康。这种冷冻机经铁道部门试用，效果良好，已经进行生产。上海光华眼镜厂青年私方人员张松坡今年试制成功了膀胱镜、尿道镜、角膜显微镜、鼻咽镜等国内从未制造过的医疗器械。武汉信记旅社私方人员曹云亭，因为服务态度好，得到旅客几十次表扬，被评为武汉市的先进工作者，武汉市工商界有许多人提出要向她学习。有些工商业者在竞赛中还纠正了不良的经营作风和学会了新的劳动本领。
