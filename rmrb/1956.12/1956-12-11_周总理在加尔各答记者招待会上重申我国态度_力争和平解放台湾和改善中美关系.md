Xinhua News Agency, Calcutta, December 10th: Premier Zhou Enlai held a press conference in Calcutta on the evening of December 9th. Approximately thirty journalists from India, China, the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and France, among other countries, attended the conference. The press conference lasted approximately one and a half hours. Premier Zhou Enlai answered a wide range of questions.

	Premier Zhou Enlai, in response to a question about Sino-US relations, said: Since the Bandung Conference, we have been making our best efforts to improve relations between China and the United States. In the Sino-US talks in Geneva, we put forward suggestions to ease and eliminate the tension in Taiwan. We suggested that the best way is to hold a foreign ministers' meeting to solve specific problems. And before holding this foreign ministers' meeting, some work can be done to improve this relationship, such as lifting the trade embargo, encouraging trade between China and the United States, conducting cultural exchanges, and allowing Chinese and American people to visit each other. But we regret that all our efforts have not received corresponding responses and approval from the US government.

	A reporter asked Premier Zhou Enlai whether he had put forward any new suggestions to improve relations between China and the United States. Premier Zhou Enlai replied: We still adhere to the suggestions we have already put forward, because none of our suggestions have received a reply of approval from the US government. On our part, we cannot see any better suggestions. If the US government hopes to satisfy the American people's desire for friendship with the people of all countries in the world, including the Chinese people, then they should make some efforts to improve Sino-US relations.

	A reporter asked Premier Zhou whether he believed that the lack of response from the US government was due to ideological differences.

	Premier Zhou Enlai said, if the reason lies in ideological differences, then why does the United States maintain contact with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries? This proves that this is not the real reason. We believe that countries with different ideologies can maintain contact and peaceful coexistence.

	A "Daily News" reporter wanted to know whether Chiang Kai-shek would serve in the Beijing government or the Taipei government, and whether Zhou Enlai, who had saved Chiang Kai-shek's life twenty years ago, had indeed expressed his willingness to let him assume such a position.

	Premier Zhou said: It is best not to talk about what happened twenty years ago. Besides, this was not done by me alone; it was done according to the needs of the Chinese people at that time. What I said in Phnom Penh and what the reporters reported are not entirely the same. I said that the Chinese government is making every effort to strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, and is striving to win over Chiang Kai-shek. If Taiwan is returned to China, then Chiang Kai-shek will have made a contribution, and he can stay in any place in his motherland according to his wishes. And you mentioned giving Chiang Kai-shek a position in the government. Actually, what happened was this: a reporter asked, would we give Chiang Kai-shek a ministerial position? I said, the ministerial position is too low.

	An Indian reporter asked about the Kashmir issue. Premier Zhou Enlai said that this issue is an unresolved issue between India and Pakistan. We hope that this issue can be resolved amicably. India and Pakistan are sister countries. The people of these two countries are of the same race. There are no irreconcilable disputes between them. The partition of India and Pakistan is the unfortunate result of the British imperialist policy of divide and rule.

	The Premier told the reporters that he had explained this to the Prime Minister of Pakistan and would explain it to him again.

	Premier Zhou Enlai then answered a question raised by a reporter from the Indian Press Trust about the Suez Canal issue. He said: The six principles adopted by the United Nations Security Council have been accepted by the Egyptian representatives. The Asian and African countries also firmly supported these six principles. The most important point of these six principles is: the sovereignty and dignity of Egypt should be respected. Therefore, these six principles have nothing to do with the eighteen-nation plan on international control put forward by Britain, France, and other Western countries. The people of Asian and African countries should not let these eighteen countries peddle their plans privately. All decisions should first be agreed to by Egypt before they can be implemented.

	A reporter asked whether Premier Zhou Enlai agreed with Indian Prime Minister Nehru's views on the Hungarian situation, and if not, on what point did India have different views from China?

	Premier Zhou Enlai said that Prime Minister Nehru had already stated his views in his speech in the Indian Parliament and in exchanging views with the Chinese Premier. Premier Zhou said that he agreed with part of Prime Minister Nehru's views and disagreed with another part of the views. He said that he had pointed out the Chinese government's views on this issue in his speech at the welcome rally.

	He said that the most important point is that, according to the actual situation, the Hungarian incident is such an event: certain groups in Western countries attempted to use the movement and dissatisfaction of the Hungarian people in the incident in order to carry out subversive activities in Hungary. At one point, this activity gained momentum, and the people were massacred. The Hungarian people, in order to save their socialist achievements, could not tolerate such things. Socialist countries, in order to defend unity and guarantee the interests of socialist countries, must never allow their unity to be undermined. We oppose any subversive activities instigated from the outside aimed at overthrowing the socialist system. The governments of some countries have been baselessly claiming that others are carrying out subversive activities in their countries. But in fact, they themselves are carrying out subversive activities against socialist countries. Of course, people cannot tolerate this situation. As for the differences of opinion between Prime Minister Nehru and the Chinese government on the Hungarian issue, as Prime Minister Nehru said, this is a friendly disagreement. Therefore, there is no need to analyze and answer questions about what differences they have.

	A reporter asked the Chinese government's opinion on the United Nations resolution on conducting inspections in Hungary. Premier Zhou said: China is not in the United Nations. Therefore, China has no obligation to answer this question.

	A reporter mentioned Prime Minister Nehru's upcoming visit to the United States and asked whether Premier Zhou Enlai had asked Nehru to convey any suggestions or messages to the US government.

	Premier Zhou Enlai said that Prime Minister Nehru is an envoy of peace, and wherever he goes, no matter who he meets, he will discuss issues related to world peace. If Nehru discusses the issue of Sino-US relations with Eisenhower, then we believe that Nehru will definitely put forward opinions that he believes are beneficial to improving Sino-US relations. We know that Nehru's understanding of the world situation is greater than ours. Therefore, any suggestions we can put forward cannot go beyond the opinions he has considered. In particular, Nehru's understanding and knowledge of the domestic situation in the United States is greater than mine.

	A "Daily Express" reporter asked about the so-called "rebellion" in Tibet and the so-called refusal of the Chinese government to allow foreign reporters to enter Tibet.

	Premier Zhou Enlai first pointed out that the Chinese government did not know that there was such a rebellion at all, and the two famous lamas who are now in India also did not know that there was such a thing.

	He said, if you are referring to the armed conflict between a group of people in Sichuan Province and the Chinese government troops, then that matter has passed. Therefore, this is completely another matter. This conflict was caused by these people's lack of understanding of the Chinese government's policies. But this has been completely resolved. The Chinese government has never made any decision not to allow foreign reporters to enter Tibet.

	A BBC reporter asked, after the Premier's current visit to India, whether he believes that Britain has done more harm than good to India, and if so, how is this the case?

	Premier Zhou Enlai smiled and said: This question should be answered by Indian friends. But I can tell you about the evils that colonialism has left behind in China. In colonies or semi-colonies, colonialism always tries to impoverish the people and prevent their economic development, especially industrial development. It is precisely because of this that, with the exception of Japan, all countries in Asia and Africa lag behind Western countries by decades. So the reason for this situation is primarily because colonialism was imposed on them. They were turned into sources of raw materials and markets for exploitation. For this reason, they do not have independent economies, let alone complete industrial systems.

	Because they do not have independent economies and complete industrial systems, they cannot become modern countries and cannot improve the lives of their people. For this reason, colonialism is a terrible disaster for us Orientals. It has made us far behind Western countries. We can see the suffering that colonialism has brought to the people not only in the villages and cities of India. This is precisely why we want to eliminate colonialism. This is the unanimous demand of the Asian and African countries participating in the Bandung Conference. On the other hand, you may say that colonialists once established some industries, built some ports, and constructed some projects in some Eastern countries. But all of this was done for their own needs and purposes. Don't forget that all these construction projects were completed by the local people and were completed while exploiting the country. If we do the math, we can say with certainty that Western countries have long since earned back their investments. In China, there are many similar examples. Even if we say that colonialism has done some good things for Eastern countries and left behind some good things, such as this building and some industries in China, Western colonial countries have long since earned back their investments. Of course, we are opposed to the colonial system, but we are by no means opposed to contact between the people of Western countries and the people of Eastern countries. What we oppose is colonialism, not the people of Western countries. And we Eastern people know that the people of Western countries are more advanced in scientific knowledge and other aspects because they have better opportunities. We should learn from them what is useful to us.

	A "Daily News" reporter asked whether the Chinese government will release ten Americans very soon.

	Zhou Enlai said that among the total of forty-four Americans, some were military personnel. Since Menon of India made efforts and the Sino-US talks were held last year, thirty-four people have been released. He said that currently, there are only ten Americans left. These ten people have committed crimes that violate Chinese laws. They have not yet served their full sentences. Two of them have carried out subversive activities against China. The Chinese government has always said that if these Americans behave well, they can expect to be released before they have served their full sentences. Now, they are still being detained in China according to Chinese law. But at the same time, they have the opportunity to visit various parts of China. They enjoy all the rights permitted by Chinese law. They can correspond with their families, and their families can visit them, as long as the US government allows them to do so. Premier Zhou Enlai also said that the US government has not released any Chinese people imprisoned in American prisons. Although the US government says that Chinese people detained in the United States can apply for repatriation, so far no one has been allowed to do so. The US government has not even given the Chinese government a complete list of the Chinese people detained in the United States, as we have done. We have handed over the complete list, while the US government has only handed over a partial list. After you know this comparison, you can draw your own conclusions about who should take further steps.

	Premier Zhou Enlai, in response to a question about convening a second Asian-African conference, said: We are in favor of this proposal, but as for when this conference should be convened and what its agenda should be, these are issues that should first be discussed by the five Colombo countries that initiated the first Asian-African conference, and then consulted with other Asian and African countries.

    周总理在加尔各答记者招待会上重申我国态度
    力争和平解放台湾和改善中美关系
    周总理说：如果台湾归还中国的话，那么蒋介石就有了贡献了，而他就可以根据他的愿望留在他的祖国的任何一个地方。　　曾经有一位记者问道，我们是否会给蒋介石一个部长的职位。我说，部长的职位太低了。
    据新华社加尔各答10日电　周恩来总理12月9日晚在加尔各答举行了记者招待会。参加招待会的有印度、中国、苏联、英国、美国和法国等国的约三十名记者。记者招待会历时约一个半小时。周恩来总理答复了涉及范围很广的一些问题。
    周恩来总理在回答关于中美关系的问题的时候说：自从万隆会议以来我们一直在尽我们最大的努力来改善中国和美国之间的关系。在日内瓦的中美会谈中我们提出了建议，为的是缓和并消除台湾的紧张局势。我们建议说，最好的办法是召开外长会议来解决具体问题。而且在举行这个外长会议之前，可以作某些工作来改善这种关系，例如取消贸易禁运，鼓励中国和美国之间的贸易，进行文化交流和让中国人民和美国人民互相访问。但是我们感到遗憾的是，我们的这一切努力没有得到美国政府的相应的反应和赞同。
    记者问周恩来总理是否提出了任何新的建议来改善中国和美国之间的关系。周恩来总理回答说：我们仍然坚持我们已经提出的那些建议，因为我们的建议没有一个得到美国政府的表示赞同的答复。在我们这方面，我们看不出有什么更好的建议了。如果美国政府希望满足美国人民要同世界各国人民、包括中国人民在内的友好愿望的话，那么他们应当作一些努力来改善中美关系。
    有记者问周总理是否认为得不到美国政府方面的反应是由于意识形态上的分歧。
    周恩来总理说，如果说原因在于意识形态的不同，那么为什么美国同苏联和其他社会主义国家保持接触呢？这证明，这不是真正的原因。我们认为，具有不同意识形态的国家可以保持接触和和平共处。
    “每日新闻”记者希望知道是会让蒋介石在北京政府中还是台北政府中任职，如果说二十年以前曾经救过蒋介石的性命的周恩来确实曾经表示愿意让他担任这种职务的话。
    周总理说：最好还是不要谈二十年前发生的事。此外，这不是我一个人做的事情，这是根据当时中国人民的需要这样做的。我在金边所说的和记者们所报道的并不完全相同。我说，中国政府正在尽一切努力来争取和平解放台湾，并且努力来争取蒋介石。如果台湾归还中国的话，那么蒋介石就有了贡献了，而他就可以根据他的愿望留在他的祖国的任何一个地方。而你们提到说给蒋介石一个政府中的职位。实际上，所发生的情况是这样的：一位记者问道，我们是否会给蒋介石一个部长的职位。我说，部长的职位太低了。
    一位印度记者问到克什米尔问题，周恩来总理说，这个问题是印度同巴基斯坦之间的未决问题。我们希望这个问题能够和好地解决。印度同巴基斯坦是姊妹国家。这两国的人民种族相同。他们之间没有不可解决的争端。印度同巴基斯坦分治是英帝国主义的分而治之的政策的不幸结果。
    总理向记者们说，他已经向巴基斯坦总理说明这一点，并且将再次向他说明这一点。
    周恩来总理接着回答了印度报业托辣斯记者提出的关于苏伊士运河问题的问题。他说：联合国安全理事会通过的六项原则已经为埃及代表接受。亚非国家也坚决支持这六项原则。这六项原则中最重要的一点是：应当尊重埃及的主权和尊严。因此这六项原则同英国、法国和其他西方国家提出的关于国际管制的十八国计划毫无关系。亚非各国人民不应该让这十八个国家私贩它们的计划。一切决定首先应当得到埃及的同意，然后才能执行。
    一位记者问道，周恩来总理是否同意印度总理尼赫鲁关于匈牙利局势的看法，如果不同意的话，印度在哪一点上跟中国有不同看法？
    周恩来总理说，尼赫鲁总理在印度国会的发言中和在同中国总理交换意见的时候，都已经表明了他的看法。周总理说，他同意尼赫鲁总理的一部分看法，不同意另外一部分看法。他说，他在市民欢迎大会的讲话中已经指出中国政府对这个问题的看法。
    他说，最重要的一点是，根据实际情况，匈牙利事件是这样一个事件：西方国家里的某些集团试图在事件中利用匈牙利人民的运动和不满，以便在匈牙利进行颠覆活动。一度这种活动很得势，人民遭到了屠杀。匈牙利人民为了拯救他们的社会主义成果，就不能容忍这样的事。社会主义国家为了保卫团结和保障社会主义国家的利益，也决不能够允许它们的团结遭到破坏。我们反对从外部煽动的、目的在于推翻社会主义制度的任何颠覆活动。某些国家的政府一直在毫无根据地硬说别人在它们的国家里进行颠覆活动。但是事实上它们自己在对社会主义国家进行颠覆活动。当然，人们不能容忍这种情况。至于尼赫鲁总理和中国政府在匈牙利问题上的意见不同，正如尼赫鲁总理所说的——这是友好的不同意。因此，就不需要来分析和答复关于它们有些什么不同的问题。
    记者问中国政府对联合国关于在匈牙利进行视察的决议的意见。周总理说：中国没有在联合国里。因此中国没有义务答复这个问题。
    一个记者提到尼赫鲁总理即将访问美国的事的时候询问周恩来总理是否曾请尼赫鲁向美国政府转达任何建议或口信。
    周恩来总理说，尼赫鲁总理是和平的使者，不管他到哪里去，不论他会晤谁，他都将讨论同世界和平有关的问题。如果尼赫鲁同艾森豪威尔讨论中美关系问题，那么我们认为尼赫鲁一定会提出他认为是有益于改善中美关系的意见的。我们知道，尼赫鲁对世界局势的了解比我们多。因此，我们所能提出的任何建议都不可能超出他所考虑到的意见之外。特别是尼赫鲁对美国国内局势的了解和知识比我多。
    “每日快报”记者问到所谓西藏境内的“叛乱”和所谓中国政府拒绝让外国记者进入西藏的问题。
    周恩来总理首先指出，中国政府根本不知道有这种叛乱，而且现在在印度的两位著名的喇嘛也不知道有这种事。
    他说，如果你所指的是四川省的一批人同中国政府部队之间发生武装冲突的事，那么那件事已经过去了。因此，这完全是另一回事。这种冲突是由于这些人民不大了解中国政府的政策而引起的。但是这已经完全解决了。中国政府从来没有作出过不许外国记者进入西藏的任何决定。
    英国广播公司记者问，总理在目前访问印度以后，是否认为英国对印度的坏处比好处大，如果是这样的话，那是怎么回事呢？
    周恩来总理笑着说：这个问题应该由印度朋友来答复。但是我能够告诉你们关于殖民主义在中国遗留下来的罪恶的情况。在殖民地或是半殖民地中，殖民主义总是设法使人民贫困，并且阻止他们的经济发展，特别是工业发展。正是因为这样，除了日本以外，在亚洲和非洲的所有国家都落后于西方国家好几十年。所以造成这种情况首先是因为殖民主义是强加在它们头上的。它们被变成了原料的来源和剥削的市场。由于这个原因，它们没有独立的经济，更谈不上完整的工业体系。
    由于没有独立的经济和完整的工业体系，它们不能够成为现代化的国家，并且不能够改善它们的人民的生活。由于这个原因，对我们东方人来说殖民主义是可怕的灾害。它使得我们远远落后于西方国家。我们并不仅仅是在印度的村庄和城市中才能够看到殖民主义给人民带来的痛苦。这正是我们为什么要消除殖民主义的原因。这是参加万隆会议的亚非国家的一致要求。另一方面，你们也许会说殖民主义者曾经在一些东方国家建立了一些工业，修建了一些港口和建设了一些工程。但是所有这一切都是为了他们自己的需要和目的而作的。不要忘记，所有这些建设工程都是所在的人民完成的，是在剥削这个国家的同时完成的。如果我们算一算账，我们可以有把握地说，西方国家老早把它们的投资赚回去了。在中国，就有许许多多类似的例子。即使说殖民主义为东方国家做了一些好事情，留下了一些好东西，譬如这个建筑物和在中国的一些工业，但是，西方殖民国家早就把它们的投资赚回去了。当然，我们是反对殖民制度的，但是决不反对西方国家和东方国家的人民进行接触。我们反对的是殖民主义，而不是西方国家的人民。而且我们东方人民知道西方国家的人民在科学知识和其他方面比较进步，因为它们有比较好的机会。我们应当向他们学习对我们有用的东西。
    “每日新闻”的记者问，中国政府是否将在不久很快就释放十个美国人？
    周恩来说，在整个四十四名美国人中有一些是军人，自从印度的梅农进行努力和去年举行中美会谈以来，已经释放了三十四个人。他说，目前，只剩下十个美国人了。这十个人犯了违反中国法律的罪行。他们还没有服满他们的刑期。其中有两个人进行了反对中国的颠覆活动。中国政府一向说，如果这些美国人的行为良好的话，他们可以期望在他们刑期服满之前获释。现在，他们仍然按照中国的法律被拘留在中国。但是同时，他们有机会参观中国各地。他们享有中国法律所许可的一切权利。他们可以和他们的家庭通信，他们的家属可以访问他们，只要美国政府允许他们这样做。周恩来总理还说，美国政府没有释放任何被监禁在美国监狱中的中国人。虽然美国政府说，被拘留在美国的中国人可以申请遣返，然而到目前为止没有任何人得到了许可。美国政府甚至没有像我们所作的那样，把被拘留在美国的中国人的全部名单交给中国政府。我们已经交出了全部的名单，而美国政府只交出了部分的名单。你知道了这种对比以后，就可以对是谁应该采取进一步的步骤得出你自己的结论了。
    周恩来总理在回答关于召开第二次亚非会议的问题的时候说：我们是赞成这个主张的，但是，至于这个会议应该在什么时候召开，它应当有什么议程，这是首先要由发起第一次亚非会议的五个科伦坡国家讨论、然后再和其他亚非国家磋商的问题。
