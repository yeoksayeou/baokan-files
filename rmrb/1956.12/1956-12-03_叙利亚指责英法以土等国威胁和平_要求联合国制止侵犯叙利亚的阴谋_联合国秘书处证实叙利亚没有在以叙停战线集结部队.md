Xinhua News Agency, 2nd Dispatch from Damascus: Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali said on December 1st that the Syrian government has taken sufficient measures to cope with all contingencies and defend every inch of Syrian territory. He said that the Syrian army, supported by the armies of Arab countries, is determined to give the invaders an unforgettable lesson.

Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar, in a telegram to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the same day, also stated that Syria is loyal to the UN Charter and hopes for peace. However, it is determined to repel any attacks from any quarter.

In the telegram, Bitar said that Syria is now in danger of being attacked by Britain, France, Israel, Turkey, and other countries, and it requests the UN General Assembly to study this direct threat to peace and take action on it.

Bitar also pointed out in the telegram that "Israeli troops continue to gather on and behind the Syrian-Jordanian-Israeli armistice lines. Statements by Turkish national leaders are a direct and open threat to Syria's security. According to an Associated Press report, Turkish Acting Foreign Minister Menderes has gone to London to discuss the so-called Syrian situation with the foreign ministers of France and Britain. News agency reports say that responsible persons from Britain, France, Israel, Turkey, and other countries are plotting an armed attack on Syria under the pretext of fabricated propaganda."

Bitar requested that the telegram be circulated as an official document at the UN General Assembly.

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd Dispatch from New York: The UN Secretariat announced on the evening of November 30th that after UN observers inspected the Syrian side of the Syrian-Israeli armistice line, "nothing unusual was found to have occurred. The Syrian army has not increased significantly compared to its level a year ago. There is no indication that Syria is assembling troops in preparation for an attack."

This UN investigation was conducted at Syria's invitation. The Syrian representative to the UN had pointed out that certain countries preparing to invade Syria are currently launching a propaganda offensive against Syria, falsely claiming that Syria is about to attack Israel, Turkey, Iraq, Britain, France, and Lebanon. Syria therefore invited UN observers to conduct an investigation in Syria.

    叙利亚指责英法以土等国威胁和平
    要求联合国制止侵犯叙利亚的阴谋
    联合国秘书处证实叙利亚没有在以叙停战线集结部队
    新华社2日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚总理阿萨利1日说，叙利亚政府已经采取了足够的措施来应付一切意外事件和保卫叙利亚每一寸领土。他说，受到阿拉伯国家军队支持的叙利亚军队决心要给侵略者以难忘的教训。
    叙利亚外交部长比塔尔在同一天给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的电报中也说，叙利亚忠于联合国宪章，希望和平。但是它决心要击退来自任何方面的任何进攻。
    比塔尔在电报中说，叙利亚现在有遭到英国、法国、以色列、土耳其和其他国家攻击的危险，它要求联合国大会研究这种对和平的直接威胁，并且对此采取行动。
    比塔尔在电报中并且指出，“以色列军队继续在叙利亚—约旦—以色列的停战线上和停战线后集结。土耳其国家领导人的声明是对叙利亚安全的直接和公开的威胁。据美联社消息，土耳其代理外交部长曼德列斯已经到伦敦去同法国和英国的外交部长商讨所谓叙利亚局势。通讯社的消息说，英国、法国、以色列、土耳其和其他国家的负责人士正在借口伪造的宣传策划对叙利亚实行武装进攻。”
    比塔尔要求把这份电报作为正式文件在联合国大会上散发。
    新华社2日讯　纽约消息：联合国秘书处11月30日晚上宣布，在联合国观察员前往视察叙利亚—以色列停战线叙利亚一方以后，“发现并没有发生任何不平常的事情。叙利亚的军队比一年前的水平并没有大量的增加。没有迹象说明，叙利亚正在集结部队准备发动进攻”。
    联合国这个调查是应叙利亚的邀请而作的。叙利亚驻联合国代表曾经指出，某些准备侵略叙利亚的国家目前正在对叙利亚发动一个宣传攻势，硬说叙利亚将要进攻以色列、土耳其、伊拉克、英国、法国和黎巴嫩，叙利亚因此邀请联合国观察员前往叙利亚进行调查。
