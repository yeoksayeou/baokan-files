The United States Uses West Germany for Espionage and Subversion
	Xí Línshēng

At the recent United Nations General Assembly, the head of the Soviet delegation, Kuznetsov, raised the issue of "the United States' interference in the internal affairs of the People's Democracies and its subversive activities against these countries." This issue has been included in the agenda of the General Assembly by a plenary meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. In order to cover up its crimes, the United States has activated its voting machine to delay the discussion of this issue by the United Nations General Assembly.

However, the shameful crimes of the United States in carrying out subversive activities against the People's Democracies cannot be concealed in any way. Everyone knows that the United States has allocated huge sums of money for this evil purpose every year and has established many espionage organizations in certain countries in Western Europe. Former "New York Times" correspondent in Bonn, Middleton, once revealed: In West Germany, the United States "has the largest espionage and sabotage center, which the United States has never established in other countries."

	American Espionage Organizations in West Germany

According to Western newspapers, the American espionage agencies in West Germany can be roughly divided into three systems, and these three systems of espionage agencies are closely related to each other.

The first system of espionage organizations is controlled by the U.S. military headquarters. The main task of these organizations is to collect fascist elements who have fled from the People's Democracies of Eastern Europe and form a special force. As early as 1950, the British "Sunday Times" reported: "The United States Army wants to recruit people from the thousands of refugees who have fled from behind the 'Iron Curtain' and now live in West Germany for 'special tasks'." Soon after, in southern West Germany, a "secret...special force" composed of Hungarian, Polish, Czechoslovak, and other fugitives was established as part of the U.S. military. According to Reuters reporter Harris, the "mission" of these special forces is to prepare to "conduct guerrilla warfare, sabotage, and riots" behind the lines of socialist countries "in the event of war."

The second system of espionage organizations is nominally funded by American private groups, but is actually controlled by the American Central Intelligence Agency. The notorious "Radio Free Europe" is one of the most important organizations. "Radio Free Europe," as the American "New York Herald Tribune" pointed out, was "designed by Americans, initiated by Americans, and funded by Americans." The director of the American Central Intelligence Agency, Allen Dulles, the former American High Commissioner to West Germany, McCloy, and General Clay, who served as the commander of the American occupation forces in West Germany, are all the behind-the-scenes manipulators of this radio station. The European director of this radio station once openly stated that this radio station is working for the "liberation" of the People's Democracies of Eastern Europe and will continue to work until these countries are "liberated." Centered on "Radio Free Europe," there are also some espionage organizations composed of fascist elements who have fled from Eastern European countries on the southern border of West Germany, such as the "American Committee for Liberation from Bolshevism," the "East European Fund Committee," and so on. According to the British "World News," there are about thirty such organizations.

The third system of special agent organizations is the Gehlen Organization, led by General Gehlen, the former head of the "Foreign Armies East Work Office" of the Hitler General Staff, who specialized in espionage activities in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. After the Nazi surrender in 1945, Gehlen took the list of fascist spy networks and defected to his American masters. The leaders of the American intelligence agencies at the time were "overjoyed" (West German "Aachen News") and reorganized it into an American espionage agency. Now, the headquarters of this organization is located in an American military reservation near Munich. Its headquarters has four thousand employees, and there are also a large number of spies scattered throughout Europe. According to the plan of the American ambassador to West Germany, Conant, in addition to carrying out general sabotage activities, the Gehlen organization also wants to create riots in Democratic Germany and the democratic sector of Berlin.

	Countless Crimes

Over the years, these special agent organizations of the United States in West Germany have committed countless crimes.

Spreading various malicious rumors to the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies of Eastern Europe is one of the most frequent tasks of these American espionage agencies. For example, "Radio Free Europe" constantly broadcasts slanders and provocations to socialist countries every day, and sometimes even openly encourages sabotage and assassination activities. In addition, since 1954, "Radio Free Europe" has also released more than 400,000 American balloons carrying reconnaissance equipment and explosives to the People's Democracies, threatening the safety of the people of these countries and causing considerable losses of life and property.

Using airborne and border-crossing methods to dispatch a large number of special agents and spies into the Soviet Union and various People's Democracies is also an important activity of these espionage agencies. Over the years, thousands of spies have been uncovered and surrendered in the People's Democracies alone. These special agents use various methods to collect political, economic, and military intelligence of the People's Democracies.

The "New York Times" once reported that "the main source of Eastern European intelligence received by the American Central Intelligence Agency is the Gehlen Organization." In order to collect information on Democratic Germany, American espionage organizations, with the assistance of American military authorities, dug huge tunnels in the underground of the democratic sector of Berlin. At the same time, these spies also engaged in sabotage and assassination activities. For example, as early as May 1952, Democratic Germany discovered an attempt by an American special agent organization to blow up the special express train from Berlin to Moscow.

American espionage organizations also openly organize large-scale counter-revolutionary riots in the People's Democracies to subvert the people's democratic system of these countries. On June 17, 1953, American espionage organizations launched a large-scale riot in the democratic sector of Berlin. The recent counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary was also launched under the planning of American espionage organizations.

	In the Hungarian Counter-Revolutionary Rebellion

Countless facts prove that in the Hungarian counter-revolutionary armed rebellion, Hungarian former Horthy elements, Arrow Cross Party members, and all kinds of fascist bandits, who were raised by American espionage organizations in West Germany for a long time, poured into Hungary in large numbers from West Germany to organize the rebellion. According to the "Berlin Daily," in Nuremberg and Munich, West Germany, American espionage agencies sent many special agents to Hungary to participate in counter-revolutionary riots. A Czech who personally participated in transporting these special agents revealed after returning to his own country that at the end of October, the espionage organization of the American armed forces in West Germany transported a group of Hungarian fascist bandits from Stuttgart, West Germany, to Hungary. In fact, not long before the Hungarian incident, these fascist elements in West Germany received instructions to be ready to "start operations" at any time. Soon, these fascist elements received orders to concentrate in Munich, and under the instructions of representatives of the American armed forces in West Germany, they formed a Hungarian "special detachment" with a total number of 11,000 people, and then sent them to Hungary in large numbers.

"Radio Free Europe" also played an important role in planning and organizing the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion. It not only incited riots through broadcasting, but also issued various direct instructions and orders to the Horthy gang. For example, on November 4, "Radio Free Europe" openly broadcast to the counter-revolutionary elements in Hungary: "We cannot send military assistance to Hungary before two o'clock this morning."

Now that the Hungarian counter-revolutionary restoration conspiracy has failed, these bandits, under the instigation of the United States, have established a counter-revolutionary headquarters in Munich, West Germany, and continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities.

	The Voice of the West German People

The huge espionage agency established by the United States in West Germany has completely become a state within a state in West Germany, seriously undermining West Germany's sovereignty. At the same time, these destructive activities that are hostile to the People's Democracies have greatly deteriorated the relationship between West Germany and its neighboring countries and have intensified the internal situation in Germany. Obviously, this situation is intolerable to all people in West Germany who have a sense of national dignity. Especially after the Hungarian incident, the West German people, including some people in the bourgeoisie, strongly opposed the activities of American special agent agencies in West German territory that incited the Cold War. The Social Democratic Party, the Free Democratic Party, the All-German Group, and the Bavarian Youth Organization in West Germany all demanded that the activities of "Radio Free Europe" be stopped immediately. The West German government was also forced to announce its decision to investigate the activities of "Radio Free Europe."

These facts show that the crimes of the United States in using West Germany for espionage activities have reached the point where they cannot be concealed; the strong desire of the West German people to oppose turning their country into a base for foreign espionage activities can no longer be suppressed.

    美国利用西德进行间谍和颠覆活动
    席林生
    在最近的联合国大会上，苏联代表团团长库兹涅佐夫提出了“美国对人民民主国家内政的干涉和它对这些国家的破坏活动”的问题。这个问题，已经由联合国大会全体会议通过列入大会议程。美国为了掩饰自己的罪行，就开动表决机器使联合国大会延迟讨论这个问题。
    但是，美国对人民民主国家进行颠复活动的可耻罪行是无论如何也掩盖不住的。谁都知道，美国为了这种罪恶的目的，每年拨出了巨额的费用，并且在西欧某些国家建立了很多间谍组织。前“纽约时报”驻波恩记者密德尔顿就曾经透露：在西德，美国“设有最大的间谍破坏中心，这种间谍中心是美国在别的国家从来没有建立过的”。
          美国在西德的间谍组织
    据西方报刊已经透露的，美国在西德的间谍机关大体上可以分成三个系统，而这三个系统的间谍机关相互之间又是有着密切的联系。
    属于第一个系统的间谍组织是由美国驻军司令部掌握的。这些组织的主要任务是搜罗从东欧各人民民主国家逃亡出来的法西斯分子，组成一支特种部队。早在1950年，英国“星期日泰晤士报”就曾经报道：“美国陆军要从成千自‘铁幕’后逃出而现在居住在西德的流亡者当中，召募供‘特殊任务’之用的人。”此后不久，在西德南部就成立了一支作为美军编制的由匈牙利、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克等亡命之徒组成的“秘密的……特种部队”。据路透社记者哈里斯报道，这些特种部队的“任务是准备在一旦发生战争时”，到社会主义国家后方去“进行游击战、破坏活动和暴动”。
    属于第二个系统的间谍组织，名义上是由美国私人团体资助，而实际上是由美国中央情报局掌握的。臭名彰著的“自由欧洲”电台就是其中最主要的一个组织。“自由欧洲”电台，正如美国“纽约先驱论坛报”所指出的，是由“美国人设计、美国人发起和美国人出钱资助的。”美国中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯、前美国驻西德高级专员麦克洛埃和曾任美国驻西德占领军司令克莱将军都是这个电台的幕后操纵者。这个电台的欧洲总台长曾经公然表示，这个电台是为“解放”东欧人民民主国家而工作，并且一直要工作到这些国家获得“解放”为止。以“欧洲自由”电台为中心，在西德南部边界还有着一些从东欧国家逃出来的法西斯分子组成的间谍组织，像“摆脱布尔什维克主义美国解放委员会”、“东欧基金委员会”等等。据英国“世界新闻”报道，这种组织约有三十个之多。
    属于第三个系统的特务组织，就是由原在希特勒总参谋部任职的专门在苏联和东欧从事间谍活动的“东方外籍军团工作处”处长盖伦中将所领导的盖伦组织。1945年纳粹投降后，盖伦拿了法西斯特务网的名单投奔了美国主子。当时美国情报机关的领导人“欢喜若狂”（西德“亚亨新闻”），就把它改组成美国的间谍机关。现在，这个组织的总部设在慕尼黑附近的一个美国军事保留地。它的总部里有四千个工作人员，此外还有大批间谍散布在整个欧洲。根据美国驻西德大使康南特的策划，盖伦组织除了进行一般破坏活动外，还要在民主德国和柏林民主区制造骚乱。
          罪行累累
    几年来，美国在西德的这些特务组织犯下了数不清的罪行。
    向苏联和东欧人民民主国家散布各种恶毒的谣言，是美国这些间谍机关的一个最经常的工作。像“自由欧洲”电台就每天不断地向社会主义各国进行充满着污蔑和挑拨的广播，有时甚至还公然鼓励破坏和暗杀活动。此外，“自由欧洲”电台从1954年以来还向人民民主国家放出了四十多万个带着侦察仪器和爆炸物的美国气球，威胁这些国家人民的安全并造成了生命和财产不小的损失。
    用空降和偷越国境的办法派遣大量特务间谍进入苏联和各人民民主国家，也是这些间谍机关的一项重要活动。几年来，仅仅在各人民民主国家中被破获和自首的间谍分子就有好几千人。这些特务用各种方法收集各人民民主国家的政治、经济和军事的情报。
  “纽约时报”曾经报道说：“美国中央情报局收到的主要的东欧情报来源是盖伦组织”。为了搜集民主德国的情报，美国间谍组织在美国军事当局的协助下在柏林民主区的地下挖掘了巨大的坑道。同时，这些间谍分子还从事破坏和暗杀的活动。例如，还早在1952年5月民主德国就曾经发现了美国特务组织企图炸毁柏林到莫斯科的特别快车的事件。
    美国的间谍组织还公然在人民民主国家组织大规模的反革命暴乱，来颠复这些国家的人民民主制度。在1953年6月17日，美国间谍组织就曾经在柏林民主区发动了大规模的骚乱活动。最近匈牙利的反革命叛乱，也就是在美国间谍组织策划下发动起来的。
          在匈牙利反革命叛乱中
    无数事实证明，在匈牙利反革命武装叛乱中，由西德美国间谍组织长期豢养的匈牙利前霍尔蒂分子、箭十字党等形形色色的法西斯匪徒，曾大批地从西德涌进了匈牙利去组织叛乱。据“柏林日报”报道，在西德纽伦堡和慕尼黑等地，美国间谍机关曾经把许多特务送到匈牙利去参加反革命暴动。一个亲身参加运送这些特务的捷克人，在回到自己祖国之后揭露说：在10月底，美国驻西德武装部队的间谍组织曾经把一群匈牙利法西斯匪徒从西德斯图加特运往匈牙利。事实上，在匈牙利事件发生以前不久，这些在西德的法西斯分子都接到了随时准备“开始行动”的指示。不久，这些法西斯分子就接到命令要他们到慕尼黑集中，并在美国驻西德武装部队代表的指示下，组成了一支总数达一万一千人的匈牙利“特别分遣队”，然后大批送往匈牙利。
    在策划和组织匈牙利反革命暴动中，“自由欧洲”电台也起着重要的作用。它不仅通过广播来煽起暴动，而且还对霍尔蒂匪帮发出各种各样的直接指示和命令。例如，在11月4日，“自由欧洲”电台就公然向匈牙利的反革命分子广播说：“今晚清晨二时前，我们还不能将军事援助送到匈牙利来。”
    现在匈牙利反革命复辟阴谋失败以后，这些匪徒又在美国指使下在西德慕尼黑成立了反革命司令部，继续从事反革命活动。
              西德人民的呼声
    美国在西德建立的庞大的间谍机关，在西德完全成了一个国中之国，严重地破坏了西德的主权。同时，这些敌视人民民主国家的破坏活动，大大恶化了西德和它的邻国的关系，并且使德国内部的局势紧张起来。显然，这种情况是西德一切有民族尊严感的人所不能容忍的。特别在匈牙利事件发生之后，西德人民，包括资产阶级的某些人士在内，都强烈反对美国特务机关在西德领土上进行煽动冷战的活动。西德的社会民主党、自由民主党、全德集团以及巴伐利亚青年组织等都要求立即停止“自由欧洲”电台的活动。西德政府也被迫宣布决定调查“自由欧洲”电台的活动。
    这些事实说明，美国利用西德进行间谍活动的罪行，已到了无法掩饰的程度了；西德人民反对把他们国家当作外国间谍活动的基地的强烈愿望是再也不能抑止了。
