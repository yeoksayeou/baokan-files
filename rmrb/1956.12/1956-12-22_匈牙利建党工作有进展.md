Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 21st: Our correspondent Li Nan reports that the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party is carrying out party building work throughout the country. Although the party building work has encountered numerous difficulties, this work has recently made great progress.

Hungarian Minister of State Marosan of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, when talking to reporters from fraternal countries on the afternoon of December 18 about the issue of party building, said that party building and the establishment of public security forces are two extremely important tasks for Hungary at present. In the past week, party building work has developed rapidly, and the number of party members has increased rapidly, and this increasing trend is continuing. Many former Hungarian Working People's Party members and revolutionary workers who have stood the test in the events have become members of the Socialist Workers' Party.

Otilau, a member of the Budapest Provisional Executive Committee, said that according to the materials from last Monday, the Socialist Workers' Party has recruited 10,000 members in Budapest alone. In the past week, the speed of party building has been faster than in the past few weeks. Now, district committees have been established in all twenty-two districts of the city, and primary-level party organizations have been established in various organs and major factories and enterprises. However, party organizations have not yet been established in some smaller enterprises, as well as hospitals, theaters, and universities.

The Budapest Provisional Executive Committee was established in early November and currently has nine members. The formal leading body will not be established until after the Party Congress is convened. Party activist meetings have been held in various districts and primary-level organizations, and temporary committees have been elected.

In the states, party building work has also begun. In addition to some former members of the Working People's Party, many new members have also joined the party. Party organizations in agricultural cooperatives are also beginning to be established.

The Hungarian Working People's Party originally had 900,000 members. During the recent incident, many staunch Communist Party members were massacred, and the party organization suffered significant material and spiritual losses. After defeating the armed counterrevolution, one of the main directions of the counterrevolutionary forces' attack on the party was to oppose party building. In factories, counterrevolutionary elements put forward the slogans "No party organizations in factories" and "Workers only engage in production, not politics" to deceive some of the working masses.

    匈牙利建党工作有进展
    据新华社布达佩斯21日电　本社记者李楠报道，匈牙利社会主义工人党正在全国各地展开建党工作。尽管建党工作遇到重重的困难，但是这个工作最近仍然获得了很大的进展。
    匈牙利工农革命政府国务部长马罗山12月18日下午对兄弟国家的记者谈到建党问题的时候说，建党和建立公安军是匈牙利当前两项极重要的工作。一周来，建党工作有了迅速的开展，党员的人数增加很快，这个增加的趋势还在继续中。许多在事件中经受了考验的原匈牙利劳动人民党党员和革命工人已经成为社会主义工人党的党员了。
    布达佩斯市临时执行委员会委员奥蒂劳说，根据上星期一的材料，布达佩斯全市吸收的社会主义工人党党员已有一万人，最近一周内，建党的速度比过去几周还要快。现在，全市二十二个区已经成立了区委会，各机关、各个主要的工厂企业都已经建立了党的基层组织。不过，还有一部分较小的企业以及医院、剧院和高等学校中还没有建立党的组织。
    布达佩斯市临时执行委员会是在11月初建立的，现在有九个委员，正式的领导机关要等到召开了党的代表大会后才能建立。各个区和基层组织都召开了党员积极分子大会，选出了临时的委员会。
    在各州，建党工作也已开始了。入党的党员除了部分是过去的劳动人民党党员外，也有许多是新加入的。农业合作社的党组织也在开始建立。
    匈牙利劳动人民党原来有九十万党员。在这次事变中，许多坚贞的共产党员遭到屠杀，党组织遭到
  了物质上和精神上的重大损失。击退了武装反革命以后，反革命势力向党进攻的主要方向之一就是反对建党。在工厂里，反革命分子提出“工厂里不要党组织”的口号，提出“工人只搞生产，不搞政治”的口号，以欺骗一部分劳动群众。
