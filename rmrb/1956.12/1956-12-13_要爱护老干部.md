    Party Member's Letter

    It is necessary to cherish veteran cadres
    Editor's Note: This letter from a Party member should be taken seriously by Party committees in various regions. The phenomenon of discrimination and exclusion of veteran cadres occurs in various places, and this phenomenon must be corrected. Veteran cadres have contributed to the revolution, and most of them have relatively rich experience in struggle. We must cherish them and ask young cadres to respect them and learn from their strengths. Veteran cadres who have work enthusiasm and are willing to work actively must be assigned appropriate work and helped to overcome difficulties in their work. Veteran cadres who do need to retire due to old age should have their lives taken care of after retirement so that they can spend their old age happily. This is our responsibility.
    Since the Gansu Provincial Party Committee convened an organizational work conference in March of this year, the selection of new forces has become a trend throughout the province, which is certainly a good phenomenon. But at the same time, another tendency has emerged in some regions and departments, namely the tendency to discriminate against and exclude veteran cadres. Some people have overlooked the main aspect of veteran cadres having rich experience in struggle through long-term revolutionary training, and have only seized upon the weaknesses of some veteran cadres being old, weak, and not highly educated, exaggerating these weaknesses to an inappropriate extent. People with this kind of thinking are under the illusion that since there are now a large number of young, educated new cadres, there is no need for those old, less educated veteran cadres. They forget that the current veteran cadres were all young cadres many years ago. The current young cadres will also become old in a few years.
    According to our understanding, the tendency to discriminate against and exclude veteran cadres is relatively serious in some counties in the Pingliang area of Gansu Province, and they have begun to develop aversion to some veteran cadres. They criticize veteran cadres at every turn, rarely mentioning their merits and strengths. Not only is little consideration given to them when selecting leading cadres, but they are not even allowed to do the work they originally held. Qingyang County replaced dozens of old township chiefs and old branch secretaries all at once, and spread some slanderous remarks about veteran cadres. Pei Wanquan, head of the agriculture department of Huan County, rebuked an old township chief in person, saying: "If you want to do it, do it; if you don't want to do it, leave. There are plenty of junior high school student young cadres." The Secretary of the Zhengning County Party Committee also said at several major conferences (three-level cadre meetings, Party congresses, county committee meetings): "The work in Zhengning County has not been done well because it has suffered from the veteran cadres." These words hurt the feelings of the veteran cadres, and subsequently four responsible cadres, including the president of the court and the procurator-general, resigned.
    Under the domination of this erroneous thinking, Zhengning, Ning, Qingyang and other counties also forced a group of elderly cadres to return home. Huan and Zhenyuan counties each mobilized more than 30 people to return home. It is right for the organization to let some veteran cadres who feel that they have difficulties in their work due to their age return home and give them appropriate resettlement. However, some veteran cadres were forced to return home even though they did not want to, and no care was given to their lives after returning home. For example, the handling of comrades Song Zhaotang and Lan Zhirong in Ning County is an example: Comrade Song Zhaotang is 52 years old and started working in 1940. He used to be the district chief of Pankeqv District in Ning County. During the Liberation War, because he participated in the revolution, the enemy killed his younger brother, robbed his family's grain, and pulled away his family's livestock. Since then, his nerves have been a little disturbed. Because of this, Comrade Song Zhaotang was forcibly mobilized to return home at the beginning of this year. No one in the comrade's family took care of him, and he didn't want to go back. Later, he was given 400 yuan. After returning home, he went to the mountains to herd sheep every day and cooked his own meals. As a result, when herding sheep on the mountain, he fell off the mountain and broke his leg. The masses have a lot of complaints about this matter. Comrade Lan Zhirong is the secretary of the Xiangluo Township branch in Ning County. He officially started working in 1947 and has always been active and responsible in his work. Because of his old age, low education, and lack of working methods, he was also mobilized to return home in February of this year. No one in the comrade's family, and he did not want to go back. The county sent people to mobilize him several times, and finally decided to pay him two months' salary. The comrade said sadly: "You used to have us climbing ditches and slipping down gullies. Now that we are building socialism, people don't want us anymore." This matter also aroused resentment among cadres and the masses. We hope that these counties can seriously examine this work and re-handle some veteran comrades who have been improperly handled.

### 要爱护老干部

专栏：党员来信

    要爱护老干部
    编者按：这封党员来信应引起各地党委重视。歧视和排挤老干部的现象在各地都有发生，这种现象必须纠正。老干部对革命有过贡献，并且大部分有比较丰富的斗争经验，我们必须爱护他们，要青年干部尊重他们，学习他们的长处。凡有工作热情，愿意积极工作的老干部，都必须安排他们适当的工作，并帮助他们克服工作中的困难；凡确因年老需要退休的老干部，应在退休后照顾他们的生活，使他们能幸福地度过自己的晚年。这是我们的责任。
    自从今年3月甘肃省委召开组织工作会议以后，选拔新生力量已在全省成为一种风气，这当然是很好的现象。但与此同时却在有些地区和部门产生了另一种倾向，即歧视和排挤老干部的倾向。有些人忽略了老干部经过长期的革命锻炼，有丰富的斗争经验这一主要方面，仅仅抓住了某些老干部年老、体弱、文化不高的弱点，并把这些弱点夸大到了不适当的地步。有这种思想的人，他们满以为现在既然有了广大的年轻的有文化的新干部，就可以不要那些年老的文化低的老干部了。他们忘记，现在的这些年老干部都是多年以前的青年干部。现在的这些青年干部，过几年也还是要变老的。
    据我们了解，歧视和排挤老干部的倾问在甘肃省平凉地区的某些县比较严重，他们已开始对某些老干部产生了厌恶的情绪。他们动辄就批评老干部如何如何，很少提到他们的优点和长处。不但在选拔领导骨干时很少考虑到他们，就连他们原来担任的工作也不让作了。庆阳县将几十个老乡长、老支部书记一下都换掉了。并且散布一些诬蔑老干部的议论。环县农业科长裴万泉当面责斥一个老乡长时说：“你愿干就干，不愿干就走，初中学生青年干部有的是。”正宁县委书记也在几次大会上（三级干部会议上、党代表大会上、县委会上）说：“正宁县的工作没作好，就是吃了老干部的亏了。”这些话伤害了老干部的感情，随即有法院院长、检察长等四个负责干部提出辞职。
    在这种错误的思想支配下，正宁、宁县、庆阳等县还将一批老年干部强迫动员回家了。环县、镇原两县各动员回家了三十余人。有些老干部因年纪过大，感觉工作有困难，组织上让其回家并给予适当的安置是应该的。但是有些老干部不愿回乡，就被强迫回乡，而回乡后又不给予生活上的照顾。如宁县对宋沼堂和兰致荣两同志的处理就是例子：宋沼堂同志年五十二岁了，1940年参加工作，原任宁县盘客区区长，在解放战争时因他参加了革命，敌人杀了他的弟弟，抢了他家的粮食，拉走了他家的牲口，从此后他的神经有些失常。就因为这样，宋沼堂同志就在今年年初被硬动员回家了。该同志家中无人照顾，不愿回去，后来给了他四百元。他回家后，每天上山放羊，还背着锅做饭，结果在山上放羊时，掉下山来摔坏了腿。群众对这件事很有意见。兰致荣同志是宁县相洛乡支部书记，1947年正式参加工作，工作一贯积极负责，就因年龄大，文化低，工作办法少，也在今年2月被动员回家了。该同志家中无人，不愿回去，县上几次派人动员，最后决定发给他两月工资。该同志伤心的说：“过去爬沟溜洼有咱们呢，现在建设社会主义人家不要了”，这件事也引起干部和群众的不平。我们希望这些县能把这一工作认真检查一下，对一些处理不当的老同志能够予以重新处理。
