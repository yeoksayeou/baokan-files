Xinhua News Agency, Bern, December 8th: The Saudi Arabian Minister to Switzerland, Sakri, said here on the 7th that the Baghdad Pact conflicts with the interests of all Arab and Muslim countries.

Sakri's remarks were in response to a recent rumor spread by certain parties claiming that Saudi Arabia would join the Baghdad Pact or some similar military bloc in disguise.

Sakri pointed out that Saudi Arabia's foreign policy is based on the following principles: First, to consistently maintain brotherly feelings, friendship, and cooperation with Muslim countries, and to support them. Second, to implement an "Arab policy based on agreements and treaties with Arab sister countries." Third, to follow sincere Arab sentiments and coordinate Arab efforts internationally.

    沙特阿拉伯驻瑞士公使说
　　巴格达条约同阿拉伯国家利益冲突
    据新华社8日讯　伯尔尼消息：沙特阿拉伯驻瑞士公使萨克里7日在这里说：巴格达条约是同所有阿拉伯和穆斯林国家的利益冲突的。
    萨克里的这些话是针对最近某些方面所散布的一种谣言而发的，这种谣言硬说沙特阿拉伯将会参加巴格达条约或者某种改头换面的类似的军事集团。
    萨克里指出：沙特阿拉伯的外交政策是以下列原则为基础的：一、始终不渝地对穆斯林国家保持兄弟的感情、友谊和合作，并且支持它们。二、执行“以同阿拉伯姊妹国家的协定和条约为依据的阿拉伯政策”。三、在国际上遵循真诚的阿拉伯情绪和配合阿拉伯的努力。
