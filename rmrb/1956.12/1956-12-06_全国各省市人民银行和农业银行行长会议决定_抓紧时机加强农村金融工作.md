Xinhua News Agency, December 4th. The People's Bank of China convened a meeting of branch managers of the People's Bank and Agricultural Bank from all provinces and cities from November 26th to 30th to discuss rural financial work for this winter and next spring. The meeting decided to vigorously strengthen the work of recovering matured agricultural loans and absorbing rural deposits.

The meeting analyzed the income and expenditure of bank funds this year. As of the end of October, the national agricultural loans issued had increased by more than 2.3 billion yuan compared to the end of last year. These loans played a significant role in supporting agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production. However, the increase in rural deposits this year has not been sufficient, which has led to some tension in the bank's lending funds. The meeting believes that the most important way to overcome this funding tension is to recover matured agricultural loans and absorb rural deposits. Doing these two tasks well will not only solve the problem of funds for purchasing agricultural products during this year's peak season, further stabilize the market, but also put the bank's credit work on a more stable and reliable foundation next year.

The meeting believes that since the State Council issued the "Instructions on Several Issues in Rural Financial Work" on October 26th, the phenomenon of some localities only focusing on requesting money from higher levels and not paying attention to recovering loans and absorbing deposits has changed to a certain extent. The trend of a large increase in agricultural loans has stopped, and in some places, farmers have begun to actively deposit money in banks and repay loans. However, there are still many places that have not carried out this work well. Some localities have not arranged these two tasks in a unified manner. Therefore, the meeting requires the People's Bank and Agricultural Bank in various localities to further implement the State Council's instructions, seize the opportunity, strengthen leadership, organize forces to go deep into the grassroots, and vigorously carry out the work of recovering loans and absorbing deposits. The meeting believes that, based on past experience, it is possible to recover 90% of matured loans in bumper harvest areas and 80% in general areas this year. For disaster areas, the matured loans of farmers with good income should also be recovered, depending on the specific circumstances. It is not possible to simply stipulate that loans in disaster areas will not be recovered at all.

Regarding rural deposit work, the meeting believes that as long as the principles of voluntary deposit, free withdrawal, and confidentiality for depositors are adhered to, and the work style of coercion and command is resolutely opposed, rural deposits will greatly increase.

### 全国各省市人民银行和农业银行行长会议决定　抓紧时机加强农村金融工作

　　全国各省市人民银行和农业银行行长会议决定
　　抓紧时机加强农村金融工作
    新华社4日讯　中国人民银行在11月26日到30日召开全国各省、市人民银行和农业银行行长会议，讨论了今冬明春的农村金融工作。会议决定大力加强收回到期农业贷款和吸收农村存款的工作。
    会议分析了今年银行资金的收支情况。到10月底为止，全国发放的农业贷款比去年年底增加了二十三亿多元，这些贷款对于支援农业合作化和农业生产起了很大作用。但是今年农村的存款增加得不够多，这就使银行放款资金出现了某些紧张现象。会议认为要克服这种资金紧张的状况，最主要的办法是收回到期的农业贷款和吸收农村存款。这两项工作做好了，不但可以解决今年旺季收购农产品的资金问题，进一步稳定市场，而且可以使明年银行的信贷工作放在更加稳妥可靠的基础上。
    会议认为，自从10月26日国务院发布了“关于农村金融工作中若干问题的指示”后，各地只顾向上要钱，不注意收回贷款和吸收存款的现象已经有一定程度的改变，农业贷款大量增加的趋势已经停止，有些地方农民已开始踊跃向银行存款、还贷。但还有不少地方没有很好开展这一工作。有的地方没有把这两项工作统一安排。因此会议要求各地人民银行和农业银行要进一步贯彻国务院的指示，抓紧时机，加强领导，组织力量深入下层，大力开展收回贷款和吸收存款工作。会议认为，根据过去的经验，今年在丰收地区收回到期贷款的90％，一般地区收回80％是可能的。对于灾区，应该区别不同情况，收入好的农户的到期贷款也应该收回。不能简单地规定灾区贷款一律不收回。
    对于农村存款工作，会议认为只要坚持存款自愿、取款自由、为存户保守秘密的原则，坚决反对强迫命令的作风，农村存款是会大大增加的。
