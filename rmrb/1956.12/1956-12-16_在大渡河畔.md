    Our car crossed the summit of Erlang Mountain, 2,500 meters above sea level, and entered a new world. As the car climbed the northern slope towards the summit, we saw dense bushes covered with white frost, rain and snow occasionally falling from the sky, and mist rising from the deep valleys, connecting with the rolling angry clouds overhead. Our car seemed to be floating in the clouds, and we were really worried about being blocked on the road by the rain and snow. But as soon as we turned to the southern slope, the warm sun shone on us through the car window, all the clouds and miasma disappeared, and the view was unobstructed. In the distance were glittering snow-capped mountains, with an occasional white cloud drifting past the peaks. The southern slope was bare. The yellow road, inlaid with reddish-brown rocks and withered grass, spiraled down like a silk ribbon.

    The driver gripped the steering wheel tightly as the car glided down the mountainside. But the passengers in the car couldn't wait any longer: "Where is the Dadu River?"

    When we stopped at Hualu Temple in the mountain col, we had already seen the glittering waist of the Dadu River in the distance. After entering Luding County in the afternoon, we arrived at the riverbank.

    We arrived at the place where the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army fought twenty years ago, and arrived at the natural barrier on the famous Long March. When we were young guerrillas and People's Liberation Army soldiers, the heroic story of the Red Army warriors crossing the Luding Bridge had inspired us to overcome many difficulties and dangers. Now we were no longer hearing about it, but were about to see this famous bridge with our own eyes. "Let's go, let's go see the iron chain bridge!"

    A comrade from Luding County led our noisy and excited group towards the center of the street. Luding has only one long street, built along the east bank of the Dadu River. We had only walked halfway when we saw an old gate on the right side of the street. The flying eaves and tiled roof looked like an ancient temple in the north. A black lacquer plaque hung under the eaves, with three golden characters written on it: "Luding Bridge."

    Walking through the gate, we stood at the head of the iron chain bridge. Several arm-thick iron chains stretched out from under our feet towards the mountainside on the opposite bank, parallel to each other. The iron chains were about one meter apart. Three rows of wooden planks were laid horizontally on the iron chains, with the middle row being the widest, about one meter wide. There were also two raised iron chains, forming handrails on both sides. The bridge was one hundred meters long.

    We stepped onto the iron chain bridge and walked towards the west bank of the Dadu River. The iron chain bridge swayed gently, and the wooden planks creaked under our feet. Looking down from the cracks in the planks, we saw the Dadu River churning and splashing dozens of meters below, which was simply dizzying to watch.

    We strolled slowly on the iron chain bridge, listening to the roaring sound of the Dadu River, reciting Chairman Mao's line "Dadu Bridge spans iron chains, cold," and feeling infinite emotion and admiration for the Red Army heroes. Here, on these rusty iron chains, the blood of Red Army soldiers and Communist Party members had been shed. A hundred years ago, veteran soldiers of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom had also reached the Dadu River, but they were unable to cross this dangerous river, and the tumbling waters of the Dadu River buried the bones of our heroic ancestors. Only the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army under the leadership of the Communist Party twenty years ago crossed the Dadu River, defeated the enemy, and sowed the seeds of revolution in the mountains of the Kang area plateau.

    We reached the west bank of the river. Stepping out of the bridgehead, we were faced with a high mountain. The mountain was steep, and a winding path climbed up the mountain. The comrade who accompanied us told us that the Red Army had come up and down this path. There was a temple on the mountainside. We climbed to the tower of the temple, and looking forward, we saw the Dadu River shimmering in the sunlight, and the rumbling roar reached our ears. Luding County across the river, with smoke curling from the chimneys, was very beautiful.

    During our half-day stay in Luding City, we also visited the building where Marshal Zhu De had lived. The local people called the place where the building was located "General Dam."

    Leaving the north street entrance of Luding and turning right, a small road led to the mountain. In the distance, halfway up the mountain, this small building with white walls and a tiled roof appeared in front of us. Children grazing in the fields pointed us in the right direction: "That's where Commander-in-Chief Zhu lived!"

    This was an ordinary building built against the mountain. A stone staircase outside the building led directly to the second floor. Following the stone steps, we entered the house. In the two small rooms, there were desks and short benches, and the words "Production, Mutual Aid" were written in white on a blackboard. This is now the Luding County Cadre Spare-Time Cultural School. As we were admiring the furnishings in the house and searching for traces of twenty years ago, a comrade suddenly discovered slogans written in ink on the wooden partition wall in the outer room. Although the wooden wall had been eroded by smoke and dust for a long time, the black characters were still clearly visible. It read:

    "The Red Army is the workers' and peasants' own army!"
    "The Red Army is helping workers and peasants!"
    "Abolish all exorbitant taxes and levies!"
    "Unite to overthrow Japanese imperialism!"...

    Facing the handwriting of the Red Army soldiers twenty years ago, our hearts were filled with infinite respect and gratitude. The soldiers cultivated by our great party, in this way, held high the banner of justice on the road of the Long March and rescued our motherland from crisis!

    Opening the west-facing window, Luding with its contiguous houses and the winding Dadu River were spread out before you. The iron chain bridge, like a belt, tightly fastened the waist of the Dadu River, and the pedestrians on the bridge were clearly visible.

    By chance, we learned about Yang Changwen, a 66-year-old man. He was one of the old people who had personally witnessed the scene of the Red Army seizing the Dadu River. When we arrived at his home, Yang Changwen was eating. After hearing our purpose, he immediately put down his bowl and said: "Many young people have come to me. In this town, I personally watched the Red Army cross the bridge." Yang Changwen's home was only about 200 meters away from Luding Bridge. He couldn't calculate the Gregorian calendar, but he remembered that the day the Red Army seized the bridge was "April 27th, 24th year of the Republic of China". Before the Red Army arrived in Luding, the White Army was stationed from Lengqi to Luding. These White Army soldiers dismantled the wooden planks on the west section of the bridge, and the east end of the bridge was also blocked with looted wooden boxes and cabinets. On the afternoon of the 27th, a large Red Army force arrived on the west bank of the river. The two sides started firing. As it got dark, the White Army couldn't hold on. They poured gasoline on the bridge planks and set the bridge on fire. "The bridge must be seized!" Yang Changwen said: "If the burning is too big and the iron chains break, it will be bad!"

    Yang Changwen pointed out to us that he was hiding in the pit behind the house at the time and saw everything clearly. First, twenty or so Red Army soldiers came up, grabbing the iron chains, jumping one step and putting one plank down, and attacked towards the east bank of the river. When they rushed to the east section of the bridge, they were fighting in the fire. When the Red Army rushed to the east bank, the shore was also a sea of fire. The White Army set the houses on fire and fled.

    "The Red Army is a truly benevolent army," Yang Changwen said: "As soon as they crossed the river, an official shouted: 'Saving the fire is the most important thing!' and extinguished the fire on the bridge and at the bridgehead. Then a large force came over."

    Yang Changwen also recounted the situation of the Red Army not violating the people in Luding, and opening warehouses to provide relief to the poor. His family also received relief grain. Yang Changwen was a poor resident at that time and lived in a dilapidated shack. In recent years, he has built three new houses.

    This 66-year-old man excitedly told us: "At that time, I knew that the Red Army was a good army that saved the country and the people. Only when the Red Army comes back will the poor have a good life. Now we really have this kind of life."

    We stayed overnight in Luding, and the next morning we drove across the Dadu River. But we crossed another wide modern iron chain bridge. This was newly built after liberation. It is located one kilometer upstream of the old iron chain bridge. On the large stone wall on the west side of the bridge is engraved Marshal Zhu De's poem "Inscription on the Dadu River Bridge": "Remembering Luding's dangers on the Long March of thousands of miles, the three armies stationed far away to strictly prevent imperialist invasion."

    The car vibrated, traveling along the cliff on the west bank of the Dadu River towards Kangding. The half-day stay in Luding left us with such a deep and unforgettable impression. (Attached picture)

    在大渡河畔
    新华社记者　李耐因
    我们乘坐的汽车翻过拔海两千五百公尺的二郎山峰顶，就进入一个新的天地。车子在山北面向山顶爬的时候，在我们面前的是：浓密的树丛上结着白霜，天空不时飘来雨丝和雪花，雾气从深谷升起，和头顶上的滚滚怒云连接。我们车子像在云层中浮游，真担心被雨雪拦阻在路上。可是刚刚翻到山南坡，暖烘烘的太阳就透过车窗晒到我们身上了，一切云雾瘴气都消失了，眼前景色一览无余。远方是亮晶晶的雪山，偶尔有一朵白云飘过山峰。山南坡是光秃秃的。黄色的公路嵌镶着赤褐色的山石和枯草，像绸带一样飘旋而下。
    司机紧张地把着方向盘，车子沿着山坡向山下滑行。但是车上的乘客们却早已忍耐不住了：“大渡河在哪里？”
    我们在山坳的华露寺停息的时候，已经远远地望见了大渡河晶莹的腰身，下午进入泸定县城以后，就到河边了。
    我们到达了二十年前工农红军战斗过的地方，到达了著名的长征路上的天险。当我们还是年青的游击队员和解放军战士的时候，红军勇士强渡泸定桥的英雄故事，曾经鼓舞我们克服了许多困难和艰险。现在我们不再是听说，而是就要亲眼看到这座著名的桥了。“走啊，去看铁索桥啊！”
    泸定县的一个同志，带领着我们这群兴奋得闹哄哄的人们向街心走去。泸定只有一条不长的大街，是傍着大渡河东岸修建的。我们只走了一半，就看到街右出现了一座古旧的大门，飞檐合瓦很像北方古老的庙堂，檐下悬着一块黑漆大匾，上面写着三个金色大字：“泸定桥”。
    走进大门就站到铁索桥头上。几根胳膊粗的铁索从我们的脚下向对岸山腰平行伸去。各条铁索相距近一公尺。铁索上横铺着三行木板，中间最宽的一行有一公尺宽。另外有两条高出的铁索，构成两边的扶手。桥全长有一百公尺。
    我们踏上铁索桥，向着大渡河西岸走去。铁索桥轻轻地摆动着，木板在脚下吱吱咯咯响。从木板缝隙向桥下望去，只见几十公尺深处，大渡河波浪翻滚，水花四溅，简直看了目眩。
    我们在铁索桥上慢慢地踱着，倾听着大渡河万马奔腾的流响，暗诵着毛主席“大渡桥横铁索寒”的诗句，心中涌起无限感触和对红军英雄的景仰。在这里，在这些生锈的铁索上，曾经洒染过红军战士、共产党员的鲜血。一百年前，太平天国的老战士也曾经到达大渡河畔，但是他们没有能够渡过这条险河，翻腾的大渡河水埋葬了我们这些英雄祖先的骸骨。只有二十年前在共产党领导下的工农红军，才跨过大渡河，击败了敌人，把革命的种子撒播在康区高原的群山中。
    我们走到河西岸。跨出桥头，迎面就是一座高山。山势陡削，一条蜿蜒小路盘上山头。陪同我们来的同志告诉我们：当年红军就是从这条小路上下来的。山腰有一座寺庙。我们爬上寺庙的楼阁，向前望去，只见阳光下的大渡河金光闪闪，隆隆的咆哮声一直传到我们耳畔。对岸泸定县城，炊烟袅绕，煞是好看。
    在泸定城停留的半天中，我们还访问了朱德元帅住过的楼房。当地人民把楼房所在的地方叫作“将军坝子”。
    走出泸定的北街口向右一拐，一条小路向山上引去。远处半山腰，这座白墙瓦顶的小楼出现在我们面前。在田间放牧的孩子为我们指点着：“那里就是朱总司令住过的！”
    这是一座普通的依山筑成的楼房。楼外一条石砌的阶梯一直通到二层楼上。循着石阶我们走进屋里。在不大的两间房里，摆满了课桌和短凳，一块黑板上写着“生产、互助”等白字。这里现在是泸定县干部业余文化学校。我们正赏览着屋里的陈设，探寻二十年前的陈迹，忽然一个同志发现在外间的木板隔壁上，用墨笔写着的标语。木板壁虽然久经烟尘侵蚀，但是黑色字迹依然清晰可辨。上面写着：
    “红军是工农自己的队伍！”
    “红军是帮助工人农民的！”
    “取消一切苛捐杂税！”
    “联合起来打倒日本帝国主义！”……
    我们面对着二十年前红军战士的手笔，心里激荡着无限崇敬和感激之情。我们伟大的党所教养的战士，就是这样，在万里长征的道路上高举着正义的大旗，把我们祖国从危急中拯救出来！
    打开朝向西面的窗户，屋宇比连的泸定和弯曲的大渡河，便铺展在你面前。铁索桥像一条腰带一样，紧束着大渡河的腰身，桥上行人历历可数。
    一个偶然的机会使我们打听到六十六岁的老人杨长文。他是曾经亲眼看到红军抢渡大渡河情景的老人之一。我们赶到他家的时候，杨长文正在吃饭。他听清我们的来意之后，立刻放下饭碗说：“已经有很多青年人找过我了。在这个镇子上我是亲眼看着红军过桥的。”杨长文的家距离泸定桥只有大约二百公尺远。他算不清公历，但是他记得红军抢桥的那一天是“民国24年4月27日”。红军未到泸定以前，从冷碛到泸定就住满了白军。这些白军拆掉桥西段的木板，桥东头也堵满抢来的木箱木柜。27日下午红军大队就开到河西。两下就开起火来。天擦黑的时候，白军支不住了。就向桥板上倾上汽油放火烧桥。“桥非抢不可！”杨长文说：“烧的时候大了，铁链子一断，就坏了！”
    杨长文指引给我们，他当时就躲在房后角的坑里，看的一清二楚。先是上来二十来个红军，手攀着铁索子跳一步搭一块板子向河东打过来。冲到桥东段的时候，就是在火里打。红军冲到东岸的时候，岸上也是一片火，白军把房子一点火就逃走了。
    “红军可真是仁慈的队伍，”杨长文说：“一过河，一个当官的就喊：‘先救火要紧！’把桥上和桥头的火都扑灭了。接着大队就开过来了。”
    杨长文又讲述了红军在泸定秋毫无犯，开仓济贫的情形。他的家里也分到了救济粮。杨长文那时候是个贫苦的居民，住的是破烂的窝棚。最近几年，他才新盖了三间新房。
    这位六十六岁的老人激动地告诉我们：“那个时候，我就知道红军是个救国救民的好队伍，只有等红军回来，穷人才有好日子，现在可真地有了这种日子了。”
    在泸定，我们住了一夜，第二天清晨我们就开车跨过大渡河。但是我们过的是另一座宽大的现代的铁索桥。这是解放后新建成的。在旧铁索桥上游一公里的地方。桥西大石壁上镌刻着有朱德元帅“题大渡河桥”的诗句：“万里长征犹忆泸关险，三军远戍严防帝国侵。”
    车子震荡着，沿着大渡河西岸的削崖向康定行驶。泸定半日留给我们的印象是那样深刻难忘。（附图片）
