Calculate the Overall Account, Recognize Achievements, Eliminate Doubts, Strengthen Confidence
    County Committees in the Songjiang Area of Jiangsu Help Grassroots Cadres Summarize the Year's Work and Improve Ideological Level
    Fan Wanjun
    From the end of November to the beginning of December, the County Committees in the Songjiang area of Jiangsu Province convened expanded meetings of cadres at the district, township, and cooperative levels to discuss the annual distribution and settlement of accounts for agricultural production cooperatives and the issue of grain procurement. During the comprehensive summary of this year's production work, the meetings conducted ideological education targeting the current thinking of rural cadres. After doing this, nearly ten thousand rural grassroots cadres strengthened their confidence in moving forward, and specific problems in their work also found solutions.

    Some grassroots cadres believe: This year's production was ruined, and the cooperatives have no advantages.
    This year, the Songjiang area suffered continuous attacks from natural disasters such as four typhoons, autumn rains, and cold waves. Although grain production increased by more than 10% compared to last year, cotton production decreased significantly, and it is estimated that the total income from agricultural and sideline occupations will be lower than last year. In addition, many agricultural cooperatives experienced a period of extravagance and waste this year, with excessive expenditures. 60%-70% of the agricultural cooperatives in the area will not be able to achieve an increase in income for more than 90% of their members. Therefore, the thinking of grassroots cadres and the masses is somewhat confused:
    First, there is an unclear understanding of whether this year's production was good or bad, and doubts have arisen about the advantages of cooperatives. Many people believe that this year's production was ruined; because this year's production was carried out on the basis of collectivization, they complain about the cooperatives, saying "suffered a big loss by running big coops" and "worked hard all year for nothing"; they feel that "the first year of collectivization was not successful and it is difficult to explain to the members," and they speak to the members with "no confidence and no strength."
    Second, in this year's autumn harvest distribution and unified grain purchase and sale work, the interests of the state are neglected. Some conceal the yield and the acreage; some retain more rations and demand more unified sales grain; some grain-producing cooperatives plan to distribute all the grain they have harvested; some grain-deficient cooperatives do not understand why the ration standards are lower than those of the surplus grain cooperatives; some want to repay fewer loans, believing that the state has "a large foundation and can afford it." More seriously, some cooperatives have already overspent. For example, 50% of the members of Huangpu First Cooperative in Shanghai County have overspent. The total income of the cooperative is only 20,000 yuan, but the public grain to be handed over is 28,000 yuan, leaving a shortfall of 8,000 yuan that cannot be paid.

    Was There Really Any Success in Production?
    Was this year's production a success or a failure? The county committees guided everyone to summarize production at the meeting in order to unify their views on this year's production and collectivization.
    First, they analyzed the losses caused by this year's natural disasters and compared them with the conditions of last year and the year before. In the discussion, everyone agreed that this year's production was carried out under many disasters. This year, the Songjiang area not only suffered continuous attacks from four typhoons, two tornadoes, summer rainstorms, and autumn rains, but also experienced a long spring cold and an early winter cold, which seriously affected the normal growth of crops. Cadres in Nanhui County said in the discussion: In the past, "snow stops at Qingming, frost stops at Guyu," but this year, snow did not stop at Qingming, and frost did not stop at Guyu; in the past, "October nourishes the little spring," but this year, October froze. According to their calculations, cotton suffered a total of twelve disasters this year: the prolonged spring cold delayed the maturity period; the April rains caused waterlogging, and the cotton seedlings did not grow strongly; the July rainstorms and hail damaged the cotton buds; the continuous four typhoons in August and September broke the cotton branches and knocked off the cotton bolls; the September autumn rains caused waterlogging, and the cotton bolls generally rotted; the October heavy frost damaged the late bolls, and the early cold wave delayed maturity... This series of disasters seriously affected the cotton harvest. Everyone realized that this year's production results were indeed hard-won.
    So, how was this year's production really? The county committees guided everyone to calculate the output and value of grain, cotton, and sideline occupations. Because the calculation of production achievements was carried out after analyzing the objective environment, everyone felt that it was not bad to achieve such results in such a disastrous year. Cadres in Zhuangxing District of Fengxian County originally thought that this year's production was ruined; after comparison and calculation, they unanimously reflected: despite so many disasters this year, cotton still yielded 150 jin per mu, which is undoubtedly a great achievement. Guo Zhicheng, the director of Lianxing Cooperative in Songjiang County, calculated such an account: the cooperative has 3,360 mu of rice. In 1949, when it encountered typhoons and floods, 600 mu yielded nothing, and more than 500 mu yielded an average of only 100 jin per mu; this year, the typhoons and waterlogging were greater than in 1949, but the average yield per mu of the entire cooperative exceeded 1949 by 500 jin. He criticized himself, saying: "Without calculation, it's all muddled; with calculation, it's clear." After accounting and comparison, various one-sided views that only looked at the yield of bumper years and not at normal years, only looked at spring plans and not at objective conditions, only looked at single-crop yields and not at total yields, only looked at cooperatives and not at individual farmers, only looked at a few cents per work point and not at how many work points, and only looked at the difficulties this year and not at the long-term prospects were criticized. Everyone unanimously believed that this year's production had achieved great results, and that leading production this year was not "laboring without success" but a great achievement. Some said: "This year's production achievement is like snatching something from the tiger's mouth; it was seized from the wind and rain." Everyone reached a consensus, their thinking improved, and they felt that they had the energy to work.

    Do Cooperatives Really Have No Advantages?
    How were the production achievements obtained? The meeting further guided everyone to analyze the reasons for achieving great results.
    In fact, everyone has had a deep experience of the collective strength that has been brought into play since the realization of collectivization. During the discussion, everyone recalled the situation when the first twelfth-grade typhoon struck. Cadres in Wenxin Township, Hengsha Island, Chuansha County, said: During the strong typhoon on August 1st, more than 30 breaches occurred in a large dike, and the tide had rushed in. At that time, more than 1,500 members immediately mobilized, laid down more than 1,000 grass bags, and rescued more than 300 dangerous dikes, ensuring the safety of life and property. After the typhoon and rainstorm, they immediately carried out drainage and rescued more than 25,000 mu of flooded land, reducing losses. There is no end to the vivid facts that can be cited about cooperatives in disaster resistance. It is precisely because the entire area has realized collectivization that when the first typhoon warning was issued, 200,000 mu of unharvested early rice out of the 300,000 mu in the entire area were rushed to harvest in one or two days, reducing losses and enabling people to live and work in peace after the severe disaster. Zhu Genxiang, the captain of the Seventh Team of the Third Cooperative in Nicheng Township, Nanhui County, suffered from typhoons in 1949, and his family begged for food and fled the famine; this year, he encountered four typhoons, but he still had no worries about food and clothing. He said with deep feeling: "Without collectivization, I would still have to beg for food and flee the famine this year." Everyone generally reflected: only the cooperatives "are not afraid of the sky, not afraid of the earth, can block the wind when it comes, and can shelter from the rain when it comes." How can we doubt its superiority?
    Everyone also realized that cooperatives are the foundation for the successful change of the cropping system this year. This year, the entire area increased grain production by more than 60 million jin due to the change of cropping system. In particular, the first year of promoting double-cropping rice was successful, providing practical experience for future promotion. Li Guixiang, a cooperative cadre in Shami Temple Township, Fengxian County, said proudly that the double-cropping rice had achieved a comprehensive harvest: "Future generations will have more food to eat, and they will have to remember the contributions of the cooperative. Without the cooperative, how could so much double-cropping rice have been grown?" Even in places where too much double-cropping rice was promoted and problems arose, everyone realized in the discussion that this was not a problem of the cooperative itself, but a mistake caused by subjectivism. As for the many benefits of collectivization, such as the fact that there are more avenues for production and various labors can give full play to their strengths, and that labor can be used in a concentrated way to carry out intensive cultivation, everyone cited even more vivid facts in the discussion. After discussion, the cadres who originally thought that cooperatives had no advantages consciously conducted self-criticism. As a result, the views on cooperatives were unified, and the determination to take the road of collectivization was also strengthened.

    Calculate the State's Support for Agriculture
    Of course, the reasons for achieving increased production also lie in the strong support of the state. This year, the state's assistance to farmers in the Songjiang area, just in terms of loans, has increased more than twofold compared to last year; after each disaster, relief funds were continuously allocated to resettle disaster victims.
    Each county helped everyone to recognize the important role of the worker-peasant alliance and state assistance in agricultural production through accounting methods, so that everyone could correctly treat the interests of the state.
    This spring, Xinxin Cooperative in Xinjian Township had 100 mu of low-lying fields. Wheat suffered from continuous heavy rain, and the ears of wheat turned yellow. It was estimated that only 30 jin could be harvested per mu. Fortunately, the supply and marketing cooperative supplied 600 jin of fertilizer in a timely manner; after topdressing, the ears of wheat remained green, and 100 jin were harvested per mu. After the cotton suffered disaster, it was also rescued because the state supplied fertilizer and "223" emulsion in a timely manner, and 80 jin were harvested per mu. After accounting, the cooperative director Gao Fengming said: "Industrial support for agriculture, just these two items, has increased the income of our cooperative by more than 1,000 yuan. Without industrial support, don't even think about sitting here in a meeting; we would be worried about what to eat!" Cadres in Tangjia Township, Chuansha County, calculated an account of the benefits obtained from the reduction of industrial product prices. The cooperative used a total of 400 bottles of "223" emulsion this year, and the price per bottle was 3.7 cents lower than last year, totaling 148 yuan lower; 600 jin of "666" pesticide powder were used, and the price per jin was 1.5 cents lower than last year, totaling 90 yuan lower; 5,000 jin of fertilizer were used, and the price per jin was 5 cents lower, totaling 250 yuan lower; each sprayer cost 20.8 yuan last year, and 17.1 yuan this year. The cooperative bought six sprayers, saving 22.2 yuan. The cooperative obtained more than 510 yuan just from the price reduction of agricultural machinery and pesticides. After accounting, everyone further realized the close relationship between state industrialization and peasants. Many people said: the state's collection of public grain and unified purchase of surplus grain is "taken from the people and used for the people," and "agricultural support for industry is obvious, and industrial support for agriculture is hidden." It cannot be seen without careful accounting. Many people consciously examined their erroneous thinking of only caring about the interests of the cooperative and its members and not caring about the interests of the state, and improved their concept of supporting state construction.
    Zong Gensheng, director of the Loutang Town Agricultural Cooperative in Jiading County, only wanted to repay half of the advance purchase deposit before coming to the meeting. After accounting, he said: "If everyone who borrowed from the state does not repay, how can the state carry out construction?" Forty-four cooperatives in Chuansha County originally retained more grain than the standard ration. After discussion, they all made self-criticism and expressed that they would save grain to support state construction and support disaster areas.

    Solve Specific Problems Specifically
    After carrying out political and ideological education, the ideological problems of the cadres attending the meeting were generally solved. However, a few cadres still believe that: the principles are correct, and the achievements are great, but some practical problems are not easy to solve. The practical problems they raised mainly included three points: first, the labor remuneration this year is low, and the income distribution is less than last year, making it difficult to explain to the members; second, what should be done with overspending households? Third, what should be done with the grain of some cooperatives that have increased production but have already distributed and used too much in the past?
    For the solution to the first problem, each county inspired everyone to calculate three accounts: one is to calculate the accounts of increased agricultural and sideline production and the income that has been distributed, the second is to calculate the increase in total work points, and the third is to calculate the family assets in terms of sideline production, public accumulation, and basic construction. After calculating the accounts of the income distributed to members and the family assets of the cooperative, cadres in Baoshan County saw that many cooperatives had actually increased their income and accumulation compared to last year, and their enthusiasm was raised again. They generally reflected: everything is difficult at the beginning, this year is the first year of being a collective, the family assets are large, and it is a little tight in the hand now. We will be more relaxed next year. Bitter first and then sweet. Our assets will always be our assets. Dongxiang Second Team, Datuan District, Nanhui County, had a labor remuneration of 2.23 yuan per labor day last year, which was reduced to 1.4 yuan this year. The cooperative cadres were originally pessimistic, but they regained confidence after calculating the total work point account. Last year, they worked 4,700 labor days, and this year they worked 8,000 labor days. The total income still increased by 719 yuan compared to last year.
    For the second problem, the meeting decided after discussion and research to adopt different methods to solve it according to different situations: those who are wealthy and have sideline income will be mobilized to repay; those who have other income will be mobilized to repay on a monthly basis; in addition to making appropriate arrangements for sideline production for ordinary households in difficulty, the overspending amount can be used as an advance payment for the next year; the most difficult ones will be taken care of in the public welfare fund.
    For the third problem, it is mainly explained that it should be handled in accordance with the state's three-fixed policy. The surplus grain cooperatives only increase the purchase of 40% of the increased portion, and the grain-deficient cooperatives use the increased portion to offset the deficient portion, but if it has indeed been consumed in the past, a little less grain can be purchased or a little less can be offset according to the actual situation.
    After the problems were clarified, everyone's concerns were completely eliminated, and they accepted the autumn harvest distribution and settlement work and the grain procurement, purchase, and sales tasks with full confidence.

    算清大账，认清成绩，扫除疑虑，加强信心
    江苏松江地区各县县委帮助基层干部总结全年工作提高思想水平
    范万钧
    江苏省松江地区各县县委在11月底到12月初，召开了区、乡、社三级干部扩大会议，讨论农业生产合作社全年分配决算和粮食征购问题。会议在全面总结今年的生产工作当中，针对当前农村干部的思想进行了思想教育。这样做了以后，近一万个农村基层干部前进的信心加强了，工作中的具体问题也有了解决办法。
    有些基层干部认为：今年生产搞坏了，合作社没有优越性
    松江地区今年遭受四次台风、秋雨和寒流等自然灾害的连续侵袭，虽然粮食比去年增产了一成以上，棉花减产却很严重，估计农副业总收入低于去年；加上今年许多农业社曾一度发生铺张浪费的现象，开支过大，全区将有60％—70％的农业社不能达到90％以上社员增加收入。因此，基层干部和群众的思想有些混乱：
    第一，对今年的生产究竟搞得好坏认识不清，对合作社的优越性发生怀疑。许多人认为今年生产搞坏了；因为今年的生产是在合作化的基础上进行的，他们就埋怨合作社，说“办了大社吃了大亏”，“辛苦一年，劳而无功”；觉得“合作化第一年没有成绩，不好向社员 交代”，在社员面前说话“理不直，气不壮”。
    第二，在今年的秋收分配和粮食统购统销等工作上，忽视国家利益。有的瞒报产量，瞒报田亩；有的多留口粮，多要统销粮；有些粮食增产社计划把打的粮食通通分掉；有些缺粮社对留粮标准低于余粮社思想不通；有的想少还贷款，他们认为国家“底子大、担得起”。更严重的是有些社已经超支，如上海县黄浦一社50％的社员超支了，全社总收入只剩下二万元，但应交公粮二万八千元，尚缺八千元交纳不出了。
    生产究竟有没有成绩
    究竟今年的生产是成功还是失败？各县县委在会议上领导大家总结生产，以统一对今年生产和合作化的看法。
    首先，对今年自然灾害所引起的损失进行分析，并同去年和前年的年景作对比，大家在讨论中认为：今年的生产是在多灾多难的情况下进行的。今年松江地区不仅遭受到四次台风、二次龙卷风、夏季暴雨和秋雨等灾害的连续侵袭，而且春寒过长，冬寒过早，严重影响农作物的正常生长。南汇县的干部在讨论中说：过去是“清明断雪、谷雨断霜”，今年清明不断雪，谷雨不断霜；过去“十月润小春”今年十月结了冰。据他们计算，今年棉花共遭到十二次灾害的侵袭：因春寒过长推迟了成熟期；4月阴雨成涝棉花出苗不壮；7月暴雨加冰雹打伤棉蕾；8、9月连续四次台风，吹折棉枝，打落棉铃；9月秋雨成涝，棉花普遍烂铃；10月重霜，打伤晚铃，寒潮早到，推迟成熟……这一连串的灾害，严重影响了棉花的收成。大家由此体会到今年的生产成果的确来之不易。
    那末，今年的生产到底搞得怎么样呢？各县委引导大家计算了粮食、棉花和副业的产量、产值账。由于计算生产成绩是在分析了客观环境之后进行的，大家对在这样多灾多难的年景下能取得这样的成绩就感到不错了。奉贤县庄行区的干部原来认为今年生产搞坏了；经过对比算账，一致反映：今年这样多的灾害，棉花每亩还收到一百五十斤，实在不能不说是很大的成绩。松江县联幸社主任郭志成算了这样一笔账：全社三千三百六十亩水稻，1949年遇到台风和水灾，有六百亩颗粒无收，有五百多亩平均每亩只收到一百多斤；今年台风和内涝大于1949年，但全社每亩平均产量超过1949年五百斤。他自我批评说：“不算账糊里糊涂，一算账清清楚楚。”经过算账对比，原来只看丰收年产量、不看通常年景，只看春天的规划、不看客观情况，只看单产、不看总产，只看合作社、不看单干户，只看几角钱一个工分、不看工分多少，只看今年困难、不看以后远景的种种片面观点都受到了批判。大家一致认为今年的生产取得了很大的成绩，认为今年领导生产不是“劳而无功”而是功劳很大。有的说：“今年的生产成绩好比老虎嘴里抢东西，是从风里雨里夺来的。”大家认识一致了，思想提高了，觉得工作有劲了。
    合作社真的没有优越性吗
    生产成绩是怎样得来的呢？会议进一步引导大家分析取得很大成绩的原因。
    其实，大家对实现了合作化以后发挥出来的集体力量都是有深切的体验的。讨论当中，大家回忆到第一次十二级台风袭来时候的情况。川沙县横沙岛文新乡的干部说：在8月1日强台风侵袭的时候，有一个大圩三十多处被打破，潮水已冲了进来。当时，一千五百多个社员立即出动，垫下了一千多只草包，抢救了三百多处险堤，保证了生命财产的安全。台风暴雨过后，立刻进行排涝，抢救出二万五千多亩被淹土地，减少了损失。说起合作社在抗灾方面的生动事实，真是说不完的。正因为全区实现了合作化，所以当第一次台风警报发出来的时候，全区三十万亩没有收割的早稻，一两天功夫就抢收了二十万亩，减少了损失，使人们在重灾之后还能安居乐业。南汇县泥城乡第三社七队队长朱根祥，1949年受到台风灾害，全家讨饭逃荒；今年遇到四次台风，仍然衣食不愁。他体会深刻地说：“没有合作化，今年还要讨饭逃荒。”大家普遍反映：只有合作社“天不怕，地不怕，风来能挡，雨来能遮”，怎么能怀疑它的优越性呢？
    大家还体会到合作社是今年改变耕作制度成功的基础。今年全区由于改变耕作制度，增产六千多万斤粮食。特别是第一年推广双季稻获得成功，为今后继续推广提供了实际的经验。奉贤县沙庙乡双季稻获得全面丰收，社干部李桂祥自豪地说：“子子孙孙多吃了粮食，都要想起合作社的功劳。没有合作社，那会种得成这么多双季稻？”就是在双季稻推广过多，出了毛病的地方，在讨论当中，大家也认识到这不是合作社本身的问题，而是主观主义的错误造成的。至于合作化以后，因为生产门路多，各种劳力能各施所长；因为劳力集中使用，能实行精耕细作，等等好处，大家在讨论当中举出的生动事实就更多了。经过讨论，原来认为合作社没有优越性的干部都自觉地进行了自我批评。于是，对合作社的看法统一了，走合作化道路的决心也坚定了。
    算一算国家对农业的支援
    当然，获得增产成绩的原因，还在于国家的大力支持。今年松江地区国家对农民的援助，仅贷款一项就比去年增加两倍多；每次受灾后还陆续拨出救济费安置灾民。
    各县都通过算账的办法，帮助大家认识工农联盟和国家援助对农业生产的重大作用，使大家能够正确对待国家的利益。
    新建乡新新社今春有一百亩低洼田，小麦遭到连日大雨，麦穗发黄，预计每亩只能收三十斤。幸亏供销社及时供应了六百斤肥田粉；追肥以后，麦穗还青，每亩收到一百斤。棉花受灾后，也由于国家及时供应肥田粉和“二二三”乳剂，才挽救过来，每亩收到八十斤。社长高凤鸣算账以后说：“工业支援农业，只这两项，就使我们社里增加收入一千多元。没有工业支援，不要说坐在这里开会，连吃的也发愁了！”川沙县唐家乡的干部算了一笔因工业品价格降低所得的好处的账。全社今年用“二二三”乳剂四百瓶，每瓶价格比去年低三角七分，共低一百四十八元；“六六六”药粉共用六百斤，每斤价格比去年低一角五分，共低九十元；肥田粉共用五千斤，每斤低五分，共低二百五十元；喷雾器去年每架二十元八角，今年十七元一角，全社买六架，便宜二十二元二角。全社光是农用药械降价一项，就得到五百一十多元的好处。经过算账，大家进一步体会到国家工业化和农民的深切关系。许多人说：国家征收公粮，统购余粮，是
  “取之于民，用之于民”，“农业支援工业是明里去，工业支援农业是暗里来”，不认真算账就看不见。许多人自觉地检讨了只顾社和社员利益、不顾国家利益的错误思想，提高了支援国家建设的观念。
    嘉定县娄塘镇农业社主任宗根生来开会前只想还一半预购定金，算了账以后说：“借了国家的大家都不还，一个柴堆两头拔，叫国家怎样建设呢？”川沙县有四十四个社原来留粮超过应留口粮的标准，经过讨论以后，都作了检讨，表示要节约粮食支援国家建设，支援灾区。
    具体问题具体解决
    进行了政治思想教育以后，到会干部的思想问题一般都解决了。但是还有少数干部认为：道理是对的，成绩是大的，就是有些实际问题不好解决。他们提出来的实际问题主要有三个：一是今年劳动日报酬低了，收入分配不及去年多了，不好向社员交代；二是超支户怎么办？三是有些增产社的粮食过去已经多分多用了，怎么办？
    对于第一个问题的解决办法，各县启发大家算三笔账：一算农副业增产和已分到手的收入的账，二算总工分增加了多少的账，三算副业生产、公共积累、基本建设等方面的家底账。宝山县干部算了社员 分到手的和社的家底账以后，看到不少社实际比去年增加收入和增加了积累，情绪又高了，普遍反映：万事起头难，今年第一年当大家，家当大，眼前手头紧一点，明年就省力了。先苦后甜，肉烂在汁里，家当总归是我们的家当。南汇县大团区团东乡第二队去年每个劳动日报酬为二元二角三分，今年降低为一元四角，社干部原来思想消极，但一算总工分账信心又高了。去年做工四千七百个劳动日分，今年做了八千个劳动日分，总收入还比去年增加了七百一十九元。
    对于第二个问题，会上经过讨论研究，决定分别不同情况，采取不同办法加以解决：生活富裕并有副业收入的，动员归还；有其他收入的动员按月归还；一般困难户除给他们适当安排副业生产外，超支款可作为下年度预支；最困难的在公益金中照顾。
    对于第三个问题，主要说明按国家三定政策办事。余粮社增产部分只增购40％，缺粮社用增产部分抵销所缺部分，但是如果过去确实已经耗费了，也可按实际情况少购一些粮或少抵销一点。
    问题讲清楚以后，大家的顾虑完全消除了，都满怀信心地接受了秋收分配决算工作和粮食征、购、销任务。
