Xinhua News Agency, December 18th, New York: The head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, Kuznetsov, told the UN General Assembly plenary session on the 17th that the issue of restoring China's legitimate rights in the United Nations is a very important issue both politically and practically.

Kuznetsov made a speech at yesterday's General Assembly plenary session, which continued to discuss the revision of the UN Charter to expand the membership of the UN's major organs, stating that "the issue of revising the UN Charter cannot be resolved without restoring the rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations." He said that when the UN General Assembly studies proposals to increase the members of the UN's major organs, it cannot fail to note that this is a question of revising some important clauses of the UN Charter. We are being asked to amend the clauses of the Charter that govern the composition of the major organs; and in the case of the Security Council, to amend Article 27 of the Charter, which lays down the rules for the adoption of resolutions not only on procedural matters but also on all other matters before it.

Kuznetsov said that the Soviet delegation believes that in discussing this issue, it must be particularly pointed out that the People's Republic of China is one of the permanent members of the Security Council, and yet, in its case, the UN Charter has been shockingly violated. For seven years, the People's Republic of China has not had its own representative in the Security Council and other UN bodies. China's seat in the United Nations is being usurped by the Chiang Kai-shek remnant clique in Taiwan, shielded by American bayonets.

He said that this blatant violation of the Charter should have been stopped long ago, and the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations should be restored as soon as possible. This is a very important issue both politically and practically. Many countries that have recently broken free from the shackles of colonialism and embarked on the path of independent national development insist on restoring China's legitimate rights. It is no longer tolerable to exclude China and prevent it from participating in the work of the United Nations. There is only one China, and that is the People's Republic of China. Nothing is more harmful to the United Nations itself than the current absurd situation of depriving China of its legitimate rights.

Kuznetsov said that the Soviet delegation firmly believes that discussing the expansion of the membership of the UN's major organs will not produce any results while the rights of the People's Republic of China are being deprived. Under the current circumstances, the main task of the UN member states, the UN General Assembly, and its various bodies should be to: ensure strict compliance with the Charter, resolutely stop acts that violate the Charter, and not allow a group of countries to use the UN to achieve selfish goals.

The Soviet delegation believes that before discussing the revision of the Charter, the most unreasonable phenomenon should be eliminated first, and the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations should be restored.

Kuznetsov also condemned the United States for forcing the Philippines to occupy the seat in the Security Council that should belong to Eastern European countries at this session of the General Assembly. He said that this is a blatant violation of the principle of regional distribution of seats in the Security Council. Given that more Eastern European countries have joined the United Nations, this violation is even more intolerable.

He said that the Soviet Union fully understands and respects the legitimate demands of the Asian countries that have recently been liberated from colonial vassalage and gained their freedom, and their desire to have due representation in the Security Council. However, this issue should not be resolved by blatantly and unfairly treating Eastern European countries.

Kuznetsov said that when it comes to Eastern European countries, the Soviet Union cannot support proposals to increase the membership of the major organs when the principle of fair regional distribution of seats in the UN's major organs is being blatantly violated.

The Polish and Bulgarian representatives supported the Soviet position, arguing that the seat of the People's Republic of China must be restored before the issue of increasing the members of the UN's major organs can be discussed. Polish representative Katz-Suchy pointed out that the twenty-nation proposal to expand the membership of the UN's major organs (at the General Assembly session on December 15, twenty countries, including Latin America and Spain, submitted a proposal to the Assembly to increase the six non-permanent members of the Security Council to eight. Representatives of El Salvador, Venezuela, Spain, Sudan, Jordan, Mexico, and Ceylon spoke in favor of the proposal at the General Assembly session that day) did not guarantee that the principle of regional distribution would be respected in the future.

Indian representative Menon called for increased representation for Asian and African countries in the Security Council. He said that the twenty-nation proposal appeared to favor Europe over Asia. The Security Council should consider the population of the member states and resolve the issue of China's representation.

Syrian representative Zeineddine argued that Western Europe had too much representation on the Council compared to Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe. He said he would suggest postponing any decision on the matter for a year. During this year, a special committee would be established to study the issue and report to the next General Assembly.

Representatives from Britain, Greece, and other countries expressed support for the proposal to expand the membership of the UN's major organs.

The General Assembly will continue to debate the issue on the 19th. On the 18th, it will discuss the Security Council's recommendation for Japan to join the United Nations.

(Editor's note) According to the UN Charter, to change the membership of the Security Council and other bodies, the UN Charter must be amended. The Security Council consists of eleven member states: the Soviet Union, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France are permanent members, and the other six are non-permanent members. The election of non-permanent members shall take due account of the contribution of members to the maintenance of international peace and the average regional distribution. The five permanent members reached an oral agreement in London in 1946, commonly known as the "London Gentleman's Agreement," which stipulates that the allocation of the six non-permanent members should be two nominated by Latin American countries, one by the Middle and Near East region, one by the Commonwealth countries, one by Western European countries, and one by Eastern European countries. However, in this General Assembly's discussion of the replacement of non-permanent members of the Security Council, the United States violated the above-mentioned regulations and insisted on giving the non-permanent member seat that should have been filled by an Eastern European country to the Philippines.

### 联大讨论扩大各主要机构成员问题  苏波等国代表主张应先恢复中国合法席位

    联大讨论扩大各主要机构成员问题
    苏波等国代表主张应先恢复中国合法席位
    新华社18日讯　纽约消息：出席联合国大会的苏联代表团团长库兹涅佐夫17日告诉联合国大会全体会议说，恢复中国在联合国的合法权利的问题，是一个在政治上和实际上都十分重要的问题。
    库兹涅佐夫在昨天大会全体会议继续讨论修改联合国宪章以扩大联合国各主要机构的成员国的问题时，作了“不恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的权利，就无法解决修改联合国宪章问题”的发言。他说，联合国大会在研究关于增加联合国主要机构的成员的建议时，不能不注意这是一个修改联合国宪章的一些重要条款的问题。有人建议我们修改宪章中规定主要机构组成的条款；而就安全理事会而言，还要修改宪章第二十七条，这一条规定了不仅在程序事项上，而且就其他一切归它审理的事项通过决议的规则。
    库兹涅佐夫说，苏联代表团认为，在讨论这个问题的时候，必须特别指出的是，中华人民共和国是安全理事会常任理事国之一，而在对待它的问题上，联合国宪章竟遭到惊人的破坏。七年来，中华人民共和国在安全理事会和联合国其他机构中一直没有自己的代表。中国在联合国的席位被美国刺刀庇护下的、在台湾的蒋介石残余集团窃据着。
    他说，早就应该停止这种粗暴地破坏宪章的做法和尽速地恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利了。这是一个在政治上和实际上都十分重要的问题。许多不久以前挣脱了殖民主义枷锁并且走上独立的民族发展道路的国家，坚持主张恢复中国的合法权利。现在不能继续容忍把中国拒诸门外而不让它参加联合国的工作了。有一个而且也只有一个中国，这就是中华人民共和国。对联合国本身的危害莫大于目前这种剥夺中国合法权利的荒唐局面。
    库兹涅佐夫说，苏联代表团坚决认为，在中华人民共和国权利被剥夺的情况下，讨论扩大联合国主要机构成员国的问题不会有什么结果。在目前情况下，联合国各成员国、联合国大会和它的各种机构的主要任务应当是：保证严格遵守宪章，坚决制止破坏宪章的行为，不容许一个国家集团利用联合国来达到自私的目的。
    苏联代表团认为，在讨论修改宪章问题之前，首先应当消除最大的不合理现象，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。
    库兹涅佐夫还谴责美国在大会本届会议上强使菲律宾占据了安全理事会中应该属于东欧国家的席位。他说，这是对安全理事会席位按地区分配的原则的粗暴破坏。鉴于已经有更多东欧国家加入了联合国，这种破坏就是更加不能容忍的。
    他说，苏联十分了解，同时也尊重最近摆脱殖民地附庸地位而获得了解放的亚洲国家的合理要求，它们渴望自己能在安全理事会获得应有的代表权。但是，这个问题不应当用粗暴地、不公平地对待东欧国家的办法来解决。
    库兹涅佐夫说，在对待东欧国家方面粗暴地破坏了按地域公平分配联合国主要机构中的席位的原则的时候，苏联不能支持关于增加主要机构的成员的建议。
    波兰代表和保加利亚代表支持苏联的立场，他们认为必须先恢复中华人民共和国的席位，才能讨论增加联合国主要机构成员的问题。波兰代表卡次—苏什指出，关于扩大联合国各主要机构成员的二十国提案（在12月15日的联大会议上，拉丁美洲和西班牙等二十个国家向大会提出一项提案，主张把安理会中的六个非常任理事国增加到八个。在这一天大会上发言的萨尔瓦多、委内瑞拉、西班牙、苏丹、约旦、墨西哥和锡兰的代表发言支持这个提议。）并没有保证按地区分配的原则在以后会得到遵守。
    印度代表梅农要求增加亚非国家在安全理事会的代表权。他说，二十国提案看来有利于欧洲，而不利于亚洲。安全理事会应当考虑到理事国的人口，并且解决中国的代表权问题。
    叙利亚代表宰尼丁认为，同亚洲、非洲和东欧相比，西欧在理事会的代表权太大了。他说，他将建议延期一年再就这个问题采取决定。在这一年期间成立特别委员会，对这个问题加以研究，并且向下届大会提出报告。
    英国和希腊等国家的代表表示支持扩大联合国各主要机构成员国的主张。
    大会将在19日继续辩论这个问题。18日讨论安理会推荐日本加入联合国的问题。
    （编者注）根据联合国宪章规定，要改变安全理事会和其他机构的成员，必须修改联合国宪章。安理会系由十一个理事国组成：苏联、中国、美国、英国和法国为常任理事国，其它六个为非常任理事国。非常任理事国的选举，应当充分考虑到各会员国对于维持国际和平的贡献和地域上的平均分配。五个常任理事国曾于1946年在伦敦达成一项口头协议，即一般所称“伦敦君子协定”，规定六个非常任理事国的分配应当是拉丁美洲国家推举两个，中近东地区一个，英联邦国家一个，西欧国家一个，东欧国家一个。但是，在这次联大讨论安理会非常任理事国的补缺时，美国就违反了上述规定，硬把应由东欧国家补充的非常任理事国席位给了菲律宾。
