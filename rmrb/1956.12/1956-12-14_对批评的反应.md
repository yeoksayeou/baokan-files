Reactions to Criticism

    To the Editorial Department of the People's Daily:

    The article "Never a Final Draft," published in the People's Daily on November 1, exposed shortcomings in the leadership style of the Shanghai Election Committee Office, which is generally correct. We accept this criticism.

    The "Several Regulations Regarding Policy Boundaries for Voter Qualification Review" took nearly a month from its first draft on August 18th to its final draft on September 11th, undergoing six revisions. This was mainly because some important issues could not be decided by the Election Office itself and were determined after the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee requested and received approval from the State Council. As for the failure to finalize the voter registration implementation measures in a timely manner, this was mainly because we lacked thorough research and preparation beforehand and displayed bureaucratic tendencies in our work style. We should be vigilant about this in the future.

    Letter from the CCP Guixi County Committee of Jiangxi: The criticism of us in the People's Daily article "Youth League Work Stalled" on August 13th is correct. We are determined to improve our working methods and pay attention to leveraging the organizational role of various mass organizations.

    对批评的反应
    人民日报编辑部：
    11月1日人民日报发表的“永无定稿”一文中揭发了上海选举委员会办公室领导作风上存在的缺点，一般说是正确的。我们表示接受。
    “关于选民资格审查的政策界限的若干规定”从8月18日拟好第一次稿到9月11日最后定稿，先后将近一个月的时间，共修改了六次，主要是因为其中一些重要问题，选举办公室本身无法决定，经市人民委员会请示国务院批准后才确定的。至于选民登记工作实施办法不能及时定稿，主要是因为我们事先缺乏周密的研究和准备，在工作作风上存在着官僚主义，今后应引起警惕。

    中共江西贵溪县委会来信：8月13日人民日报“青年团工作停顿”一文中，对我们的批评是正确的。我们决心改进工作方法，注意发挥各群众团体的组织作用。
