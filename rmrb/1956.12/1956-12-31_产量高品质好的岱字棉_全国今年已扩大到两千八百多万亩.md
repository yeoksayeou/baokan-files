    High-Yielding, High-Quality Daizi Cotton
    National Acreage Expanded to Over 28.8 Million Mu This Year

    (Our dispatch) This year, the cotton-growing areas of East China, North China, and other regions have expanded the cultivation of Daizi cotton, known for its high yield, high ginning percentage, and good quality, to 28.84 million mu, accounting for 33.8% of the total area planted with improved cotton varieties. The unit yield of Daizi cotton is generally 10%-15% higher than other improved varieties, and the ginning percentage is 3%-4% higher. Calculating an increase of three jin of ginned cotton per mu, the 28 million mu of Daizi cotton could produce an additional 84 million jin of ginned cotton.
    Daizi cotton was introduced from abroad in 1950. It was initially promoted and propagated in provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi. Subsequently, most or parts of Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, and other provinces also promoted it. Over the past few years, the planting area of Daizi cotton in these cotton-growing regions has expanded from several hundred thousand mu to over 20 million mu. Especially in the cotton-growing regions of the Yangtze River basin, Daizi cotton has become almost the only improved cotton variety used.
    According to experiments by some agricultural scientific research departments and large-scale planting results by agricultural production units, it has been proven that Daizi cotton is also suitable for planting in many cotton-growing areas of the Yellow River basin. This year, Xinyemo in Henan planted Daizi cotton, which not only had a much higher unit yield than other improved varieties, but also produced seven more jin of ginned cotton per hundred jin of seed cotton than in the past, and the fiber length increased by three millimeters. The promotion of Daizi cotton in the Hebei cotton area has also been effective. This year, Daizi cotton planted in Chengan, Nangong, Jin County, and Shulu Counties was shorter, more compact, had more fruiting branches, lower fruiting branch nodes, shorter flowering period, and earlier boll opening than Sizi No. 2 cotton. This year, Zhanghe Agricultural Cooperative in Chengan County harvested 45 jin of first-bloom cotton per mu of Daizi cotton, 30 jin more than Sizi No. 2 cotton. The 100,000 mu of Daizi cotton in the Shijiazhuang area yielded an average of 11.7% more than local varieties of cotton fields. The 17,000-plus mu of Daizi cotton in Wuqiao County yielded 25% more than Sizi Wu'ai cotton. Farmers who grow Daizi cotton can get a higher selling price than those who grow other varieties of cotton. For example, in Nangong, Hebei, every hundred jin of Daizi cotton (seed cotton) sells for three or four yuan more than Sizi No. 2 cotton.
    Many cotton-producing areas are planning to plant more Daizi cotton next year.

    产量高品质好的岱字棉
    全国今年已扩大到两千八百多万亩
    本报讯　今年华东、华北等地的棉区推广了产量高、衣分高、品质好的岱字棉两千八百四十多万亩，占棉花良种种植面积的33.8％。岱字棉的单位产量一般比其他良种高10％—15％，衣分比其他良种高3％—4％。以每亩增产皮棉三斤计算，两千八百万亩岱字棉可以增产皮棉八千四百多万斤。
    岱字棉是1950年从国外引进的。最初在江苏、浙江、江西等省推广和繁殖。湖北、安徽、湖南等省的大部地区或部分地区随后也都推广了。几年来，这些棉区的岱字棉种植面积已由二十几万亩扩大到两千多万亩。特别是在长江流域各棉区，岱字棉几乎成了唯一被采用的棉花良种。
    根据一些农业科学研究部门的试验和农业生产单位的大面积种植结果，证明岱字棉也适宜在黄河流域的不少棉区种植。河南新野今年种植的岱字棉，不仅单位产量高出其他良种很多，而且每百斤籽棉比过去多出皮棉七斤，纤维长度增加三毫米。岱字棉在河北棉区推广，效果也好。成安、南宫、晋县、束鹿等县今年种的岱字棉都比斯字二比棉株短、紧凑、果枝多、果枝节位低、花期短、吐絮早。成安县彰河农业社今年种植的岱字棉的头盆花每亩收到四十五斤，比斯字二比棉多收三十斤。石家庄专区十万亩岱字棉比当地品种的棉田平均增产11.7％。吴桥县一万七千多亩岱字棉比斯字五爱棉增产25％。种植岱字棉的农民，比种其他品种的棉花能得到更高的售价。例如，在河北南宫，每百斤岱字棉（籽棉）比斯字二比棉要多卖三、四元。
    不少棉产区都计划在明年更多种植岱字棉。
