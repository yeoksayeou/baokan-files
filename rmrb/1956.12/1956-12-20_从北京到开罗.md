    From Beijing to Cairo
    By Our Correspondent Jiang Yuanchun
    On the afternoon of December 2nd, night had gradually enveloped Nanyuan Airport. The Ty-104 jet airliner, on its first official flight between Beijing and Prague, carried us five journalists visiting Egypt and many international friends away from Beijing. Three hours later, the plane landed in Irkutsk. Due to bad weather, we spent the night in Irkutsk. The next morning, we continued to fly to Omsk. The harsh climate of snowy Siberia made us guests in Omsk for another day. It wasn't until the morning of the third day that the plane broke through the thick clouds and delivered us to Vnukovo Airport in Moscow.

    As a result, we missed our scheduled flight from Moscow to Belgrade. We had originally planned to reach Belgrade that day in order to catch a plane to Cairo that evening. Since there were no available seats on flights to Belgrade for the next few days, the travel agency suggested that we go to Prague, transfer to Zurich in Switzerland, and take a direct flight to Cairo from Zurich. Given the circumstances, we had no choice but to take this route.

    After a quick meal at the airport, we boarded the plane to Prague and continued our journey. At 7:00 PM Prague time, we arrived in Prague. It was drizzling here, as gentle and moist as a spring night.

    Prague was as beautiful and peaceful as ever. The trees on the sidewalks and in the courtyards had lost their leaves, but the grass had not completely withered, and its green color made people feel especially happy in this gloomy winter weather. The rain continued to fall, preventing us hurried travelers from seeing the city of Prague before we boarded the plane to Zurich.

    Two hours later, we were sitting in the waiting room of Zurich Airport. We were told that the direct flight from Zurich to Cairo had been canceled today, so we would have to take a flight to Athens in two hours and then take a Greek airline flight to Cairo from Athens.

    The weather in Zurich was gloomy, with dark clouds hanging low over the airport. However, as soon as the Swiss Airlines plane we were on took off from the airport and broke through the thick clouds, the bright afternoon sun immediately filled the cabin. To the south, at the end of a sea of clouds, the snow-capped peaks of the Alps stood proudly like isolated islands in the ocean.

    A beautiful and tidy female flight attendant walked down the aisle between the seats with a large stack of Western newspapers. I asked for a copy of the "Herald Tribune" published in New York. This was the European edition of the December 4th newspaper. On the front page were news reports about British Foreign Secretary Lloyd's announcement in the House of Commons on December 3rd that British and French troops would withdraw from Port Said, about fifteen American oil companies discussing transporting oil to Western Europe, and about the so-called Syrian "threat" to peace in the Middle East. We had already learned of this news yesterday in Prague from the English news of the Xinhua News Agency. Looking at this news, I wondered what Prime Minister Eden, who was "recovering" in Jamaica, would do now? After Butler had withstood this scorched stubble for him and found this only viable path, he would perhaps suddenly recover, return to London, and try to salvage something from the defeat!

    The plane stopped briefly in Geneva. After having a cup of tea in the airport lounge, the sky was getting dark when we boarded the plane again to fly to Athens, and the flight attendant handed out the day's European newspapers. The British newspapers almost all used Macmillan's announcement of oil price increases as the headline. The "Daily Mail" had the banner headline "Oil Storm Erupts," and the "Daily Express" used the single word "Oildom" as the banner headline. Without reading the news, one could tell from the headlines how the British ruling class was shifting the serious consequences of the aggression against Egypt onto the people, and how much the broad sections of the British people hated this. The "Daily Mail" marked a total of six "increases" in its banner headline, pointing out that oil had risen by one shilling and five pence, bread by half a penny, bus fares and business car prices had risen, and household goods and almost all food had all gone up in price.

    Even more interesting was that several British newspapers published photos of British soldiers in Port Said cheering the withdrawal from Egypt. The "Daily Telegraph" published a photo on page twelve of British soldiers taking off their hats and shouting with joy. The "Daily Mail" published a large photo on the last page, occupying almost a quarter of the page, with British soldiers holding up their guns, smiling broadly, and one person even blowing a trumpet. The editor wrote in the caption that the soldiers hoped to be able to go home for Christmas. Yes, Christmas, which Europeans value so much, was approaching. In Prague, the shops had already made colorful Christmas window displays, and the people who worked peacefully were enjoying another price reduction before Christmas. And those British soldiers in Port Said who cheered the withdrawal probably had not yet thought that even if they returned home, a difficult Christmas awaited them.

    In the deepening night, the plane flew over the snow-covered Alps towering above the sea of clouds. The lights of the residents' homes in the mountains gave a feeling of warmth, as if one could imagine how these Swiss or Italians were sitting around a crackling fireplace, warming themselves and enjoying the peace and rest after a day's work, surrounded by heavy snow.

    The climate south of the Alps was sunny, as different as two worlds from the north of the mountains. From the plane, the lights of many towns in Italy could be clearly seen. Milan passed, Florence passed, and I was reminded of "A Night in Florence," which I had read as a child, probably by Zhu Ziqing. The lights of these cities, large and small, were extremely beautiful, as if it were someone's daughter, using her skillful hand, attaching strings of beads made of colored glass to a piece of black velvet.

    The plane flew along the west coast of Italy, crossed the Ionian Sea, and landed at Athens Airport at 10:30 PM Greek time.

    In Athens, we had to transfer to a Greek airline plane to Cairo. The Greek plane was not scheduled to take off until 10:00 AM the next day, so we had to stay in Athens overnight. Swiss Airlines arranged accommodation for us in the city. But we didn't have visas!

    We five Chinese journalists going to Egypt, who did not have Greek visas, lined up at the back of a long queue of passengers at passport control. These five uninvited guests clearly brought trouble to the passport control officials, who talked in Greek for a long time and went out to make phone calls, probably to ask their superiors for instructions. Finally, they told us: Sorry, we could not go into the city to stay in a hotel and could only spend the night at the airport.

    However, the officials' attitudes were still friendly. They had an undisguised curiosity and interest in us few people who had come to Greek soil from the new China. They spoke to us in English, asked us where we had learned English, said that Chinese was as difficult to learn as Greek, and talked about the Mediterranean's unique blue-green sky... We offered them Big Front Door cigarettes, which they were very happy about and began to praise the politeness of the Chinese. Although we did not understand their language, they were clearly trying to find a way for us to have a good night.

    We accepted the fate of spending the night at the airport and put down our coats and bags in the waiting room. The weather here was already very warm, and it was not bad to sleep on a soft chair with a coat over us for a night. Just as we had drunk tea and coffee, put on our coats, and closed our eyes, people suddenly came and asked us if we would like to go to a hotel to sleep.

    Obviously, the order to spend the night at the airport had been rescinded, and the beds in the hotel were much better than the soft chairs in the waiting room. We agreed to go to the hotel. A travel car took us to a small hotel a few minutes away from the airport. On the way, the Swiss Airlines flight attendant, who had been taking care of us all the time, while comforting a basket of chirping chicks in her arms, turned around and asked us:

    "Are you going to Cairo to be soldiers?"

    The idea of "going to be soldiers" was so far from our minds that we didn't even understand the word "soldier" she said in English. After asking twice, we realized that she thought we were Chinese volunteers going to support the Egyptian people, which made us all laugh.

    The lady was not embarrassed by our laughter. She told us that she had read a book about China and wanted to see China very much. I said that we hoped she would have the opportunity to go to China, because China was not only very beautiful, but also very hospitable. She seemed to say very seriously: "This is my first wish." This unknown lady reminded me that we have friends everywhere.

    It was already one o'clock in the morning when we entered the hotel. This hotel was obviously arranged for us temporarily, because the other passengers going to Cairo who had come on the same plane as us were not staying here. A man was sitting in the living room, looking at us with a wary expression. Even so, we still had to thank those who had worked hard to arrange the hotel for us. More than ten minutes later, we were lying in bed.

    When I woke up, I realized that the hotel was on the seaside. This was a bay of the Aegean Sea, and the city of Athens itself was still to the west. The weather was very good, and the sea was calm. The blue waves were rippling by the shore. This was a place for sightseeing and rest, and many small yachts were tied up by the shore, and some people were rowing out to sea. On the roadside by the shore, the plane trees had shed their leaves, but the grass was still green, and nameless red and purple flowers were blooming noisily in the courtyards, as if it were spring in the Jiangnan region of China. Although it was still a bit chilly, when the sun came out, one felt that one was wearing too many clothes.

    After completing the formalities for passports, customs, etc. at the airport, we boarded the plane, and it was already ten o'clock in the morning. One could see American Air Force planes landing and taking off, and many planes marked with the words "US Air Force" were also parked on the tarmac. Our plane flew towards the Mediterranean Sea without looking back. We said goodbye to Athens, this historical city, as if we had known it before.

    The weather was very good, and one could see the continuous mountains on the Greek coast. After crossing the scattered islands, it was difficult to distinguish between the sea and the sky. White clouds floated over the sea. Looking down from the plane, those white clouds were like white lotus flowers blooming on a lake. More than an hour later, the plane passed over Crete. One could see the sheer cliffs and rugged rocks. In many places, there were completely bare rocks. Years of erosion and corrosion had cleaved deep gullies in these rocks. The industrious Greek people had opened up terraced fields on this mountainous island, making use of every piece of land that could be used in the rocks. This reminded me of the way farmers in Guangxi opened up land in the mountains.

    After passing Crete, we entered the Mediterranean Sea, and the amount of clouds in the sky increased. Finally, the plane flew completely above the clouds, and only occasionally could we see the dim sea below. At 1:00 PM, from the gradually descending plane, we could see the coast of Egypt. Egypt, we have finally come to you from far away China.

    The plane entered Egypt from the sky above the Nile Delta, and one could see a branch of the Nile River flowing into the sea. The annual flooding of the Nile River had only recently ended, and the river water was still yellow. The air was foggy, and the ground was moist, and it looked like it was raining. After we arrived in Cairo, the Egyptian customs officers told us that this was the first rain in Cairo this year, and we happened to run into it.

    The Nile River has brought life to Egypt, but without the labor of the industrious Egyptian people, the Nile River would not be able to bless the people. This can be seen very clearly from the plane. This fertile delta is covered with large and small ditches like veins. The main channels are very wide, and one can see boats sailing in them. It is these ditches that lead water to the fields, making the land green. It can be seen that the utilization rate of the land here is very high. Although it is winter, most of the land is planted with something. The roofs of almost every house in the village are used as places to store fodder. Therefore, looking from the plane, if the streets and walls did not outline the contours, each village would seem to be a yellow grassland.

    The closer the plane got to Cairo, the clearer one could see the Egyptian people's struggle against the desert. Large areas of desert began to appear next to the green fields. In many places, Egyptian farmers planted trees in the desert, using the trees to form a rectangular enclosure, and planting fruit trees and crops inside this hedge.

    At about 1:30 PM, the plane landed at Cairo Airport. This was a desert, far away from the city of Cairo itself. We got off the plane and stepped on Egyptian soil, feeling as if we had arrived at our own home, and breathed a great sigh of relief. The five-day tense journey had come to an end, and we were about to meet the heroic Egyptian people.

    While we were waiting in the lounge for the car to take us to the city, a plane painted with the words "United Nations" landed at the airport. The commander of the "United Nations Emergency Force," Burns, got off the plane. With a stern face, he and an Indian officer immediately walked out of the airport. Burns came from Port Said. Later, Gordon, the public relations officer of the "United Nations Emergency Force," announced in Cairo that Burns had reached an agreement with the commanders of the British and French invading forces that the British and French forces would withdraw from Port Said within two or three weeks.

    We came at just the right time.

    从北京到开罗
    本报记者　蒋元椿
    12月2日下午，夜色已经渐渐笼罩了南苑机场。第一次在北京和布拉格之间正式通航的Ty—104式喷气客机，载着我们去埃及访问的五名记者和许多国际友人离开了北京。三个小时之后，飞机在伊尔库次克降落。由于气候不好，我们在伊尔库次克过夜。第二天早上续飞鄂木斯克。白雪茫茫的西伯利亚的恶劣气候，使我们在鄂木斯克又做了一天客人。一直到第三天上午，飞机才穿过厚厚的云层，把我们送到了莫斯科的夫努科伏机场。
    这样一来，我们没有赶上预定好了的从莫斯科飞贝尔格莱德的班机。我们本来是准备当天赶到贝尔格莱德，以便晚上从那里搭机去开罗的。由于以后几天去贝尔格莱德的飞机都已经没有空位，旅行社建议我们去布拉格，从那里转瑞士的苏黎世，从苏黎世有直达开罗的航线。既然如此，我们就只好走这条路了。
    在机场匆匆地吃了一顿饭，跨上去布拉格的飞机，继续赶路。布拉格时间晚上七时，我们到了布拉格。这里正在下蒙蒙细雨，温润有如春夜。
    布拉格依然那样美丽、安静。人行道上和庭院里的树已经落了叶，可是草还没有完全枯萎，青青的颜色，在这晦暗的冬天的日子里，使人看了特别愉快。雨还是下个不停，使我们这些匆匆的过客来不及看一看布拉格的市容，就走上了去苏黎世的飞机。
    两个小时以后，我们坐在苏黎世机场的候机室里了。我们被告诉说，由苏黎世直飞开罗的班机今天取消了，因此我们必须在两小时之后，坐去雅典的飞机，然后再从雅典坐希腊航空公司的飞机去开罗。
    苏黎世天气阴沉，暗云低低地笼罩着机场。可是，当我们乘坐的瑞士航空公司的飞机从机场起飞并且钻出了厚厚的云层以后，明亮的午后的阳光立刻就充满了座舱。南面，在一片云海的尽头，积雪的阿尔卑斯山的峰巅，像大海中的孤岛似的傲然耸立着。
    美丽的整洁的女服务员挟着一大叠西方的报纸，从座位中间的通道上走来。我要了一份纽约出版的“先驱论坛报”。这是12月4日报纸的欧洲版。在第一页上，刊载着英国外交大臣劳埃德12月3日在下院宣布英、法军队将从塞得港撤退的消息，十五个美国石油公司筹商向西欧运输石油的消息，以及关于所谓叙利亚对中东和平的“威胁”的报道。这些消息，昨天在布拉格，就已经从新华社的英文电讯上知道了。看着这些消息，我想，在牙买加“休养”的艾登首相现在又将如何呢？在巴特勒替他抗住了这段焦烂的木梢，找到了这条唯一可行的道路之后，他也许就要霍然而愈，回到伦敦去，尽力从失败之中捞回一点什么吧！
    飞机在日内瓦停留了片刻。在机场休息室里喝了一杯茶，再上飞机飞雅典的时候，天色已经快黑了，女服务员送来了当天的欧洲报纸。英国报纸这天几乎都用麦克米伦宣布石油加价作为头条新闻。“每日邮报”的通栏大标题是“石油风暴爆发”，“每日快报”用“石油化”一个字作了通栏标题。不用看新闻，光看标题就可以知道，英国统治集团正在怎样把侵略埃及的严重后果转嫁到人民身上，而英国广泛阶层的人对此又是如何憎恨。“每日邮报”在它的通栏标题上一共标了六个“上涨”，指出石油上涨一先令五便士，面包上涨半便士，公共汽车的票价和出差汽车的价格上涨，家用物品以及几乎所有食物全都涨价。
    更有意思的是好几张英国报纸都刊登了在塞得港的英军士兵欢呼撤出埃及的照片。“每日电讯报”在第十二版上登了一张英国士兵脱帽高呼，喜形于色的照片。“每日邮报”在最后一页上刊登了将近四分之一版的一张大照片，英国士兵们都高举着枪喜笑颜开，有一个人还吹起了喇叭。编辑在说明上写道，士兵们希望能够回家过圣诞节。是的，欧洲人十分重视的圣诞节快到了。在布拉格，商店已经作好了五彩缤纷的圣诞节的橱窗布置，和平劳动的人民正在享受圣诞节前的又一次降低物价的好处。而塞得港那些欢呼撤退的英国士兵，也许还没有想到即使他们回了家，等着他们的也是一个艰难的圣诞节。
    在夜色越来越浓之中，飞机飞过了白雪皑皑的耸立在云海之上的阿尔卑斯山。山上居民家里的点点灯光，给人以温暖的感觉，仿佛可以想像到这些瑞士人或是意大利人怎样在大雪包围之中，在一炉毕剥爆响的炉火旁围坐取暖，享受一天劳动以后的宁静和休息。
    阿尔卑斯山以南气候晴朗，同山北判若两个世界。从飞机上可以清楚地看到意大利的许多城镇的灯火。米兰过去了，翡冷翠过去了，想起了小时候读过的大概是朱自清的“翡冷翠的一夜”。这些大大小小的城市的灯光，极其美丽，似乎是谁家的姑娘，用她的灵巧的素手，在一块黑天鹅绒上别上了一串串用各色琉璃珠子串成的璎珞。
    飞机沿着意大利的西海岸飞行，越过伊奥尼亚海，希腊时间晚上十时半在雅典机场降落。
    在雅典，我们须换乘希腊航空公司的飞机去开罗。希腊飞机要在第二天上午十时才起飞，因此必须在雅典住宿一夜。瑞士航空公司给我们在市内安排了住处。可是我们没有签证！
    在验护照的地方排了很长的一队旅客，我们五个去埃及的没有希腊签证的中国记者排在最后。我们这五位不速之客显然给查验护照的官员带来了麻烦，他们用希腊话交谈了很久，出去打了电话，大概是向他们的上级请示。最后，他们告诉我们说：很抱歉，我们不能进城去住旅馆，只能在机场过夜。
    但是，那些官员们的态度还是友好的。对于我们这几个从新中国来到希腊土地上的人，他们有着掩饰不住的好奇和兴趣。他们用英语同我们交谈，问我们是在哪里学的英语，说中文同希腊文一样难学，谈起地中海特有的蓝的发绿的天……。我们请他们抽了大前门香烟，他们很高兴，并且开始称赞中国人的彬彬有礼。虽然我们不懂他们的话，可是他们显然是在想办法使我们能够好好地过一夜。
    我们接受了在机场过夜的命运，在候机室放下了大衣和皮包。这里天气已经很暖和，盖着大衣在软椅上睡一宿也不算坏。正当我们喝了茶和咖啡，盖上大衣闭上眼睛的时候，人们忽然来问我们愿不愿意上旅馆睡觉。
    显然，在机场过夜的成命收回了，而旅馆里的床总比候机室的软椅要好得多。我们同意去旅馆。一辆旅行轿车把我们送到离机场几分钟路程的一家小旅馆。在路上，瑞士航空公司的那位一直在照料我们的女服务员，一面安抚端在她怀里的那一筐子唧唧叫着的小鸡，一面回过头来问我们道：
    “你们是不是去开罗当兵去的？”
    “当兵去”这个念头离我们的思想太远，以致我们一下子竟然听不懂她用英语说的这个“兵”字。我们问了两遍以后才弄清楚，原来她以为我们是去支援埃及人民的中国的志愿军，这就使得我们全都哈哈大笑。
    这位小姐并没有因为我们的大笑而羞恼，她告诉我们她读过一本关于中国的书，很想看看中国。我说，我们很希望她能有机会去中国，因为中国不但很美，而且也很好客。她似乎是很认真地说：“这是我的第一个愿望。”这位不知名的小姐使我想到：我们在哪里都有着朋友呵。
    进旅馆已经是深夜一点钟了。这个旅馆显然是临时替我们安排的，因为同我们同一架飞机来的旁的去开罗的乘客都不住在这里。客厅里还坐着一个男子，带着警惕的神气望着我们。虽然如此，我们还是得谢谢那些出力替我们安排旅馆的人。十多分钟以后，我们就躺在床上了。
    一觉醒来，才发现旅馆原来就在海边。这是爱琴海的一个海湾，雅典城本身还在西面。天气很好，海面上风平浪静。岸堤边碧波荡漾。这里是游览休息的去处，岸边系了不少小游艇，有人划着出海去。岸边马路上，梧桐已经落叶，可是草色依然青青，庭院里喧闹地开着红色和紫色的不知名的花，仿佛是中国江南的春季，虽然还有点寒意，可是太阳一出来，就感到身上衣服多了。
    在机场办完了护照、海关等等手续，坐上飞机，已经是上午十点钟了。可以看到正在降落和起飞的美国空军的飞机，停机坪上也停放着不少标有“美国空军”字样的飞机。我们的飞机头也不回地向着地中海上飞去。雅典，这个历史名城，我们就这样似曾相识地同它告别了。
    天气很好，可以望见希腊海岸上连绵不断的山峦。越过星罗棋布的岛屿以后，海与天就很难分辨了。一朵一朵的白云，在海面上游过。从飞机上望下去，那些白云就像是湖上盛开的白莲花。一个多小时以后，飞机经过克里特岛。可以看到壁立的悬崖和巉岩。在许多地方，完全是裸露的岩石。多年的冲刷和浸蚀，在这些岩石中间劈开了一道一道的深沟。勤劳的希腊人民在这座山峦起伏的岛上开辟了梯田，利用岩石中间每一块可以利用的土地。这使我想起了广西农民在山地里开辟土地的情形。
    过克里特岛以后，进入了地中海，天空中云量越来越多，最后飞机完全在云上飞行，只是偶而可以见到下面黯淡的海面。下午一时，从渐渐降低的飞机中，可以望到埃及的海岸了。埃及，我们终于从遥远的中国来到你这里了。
    飞机从尼罗河三角洲的上空进入埃及，可以看到尼罗河入海的一条支流。尼罗河每年的涨水结束才不久，河水还是黄的。空中云雾低迷，地上是润湿的，看来是在下雨。我们到开罗以后，埃及海关的人员告诉我们说，这是今年开罗第一次下雨，正巧给我们碰上了。
    尼罗河给埃及带来了生命，可是如果没有勤劳的埃及人民的劳动，尼罗河也是不可能赐福于人民的。这一点，从飞机上可以看得很清楚的。在这片肥沃的三角洲上，布满了脉络一样的大大小小的沟渠。主要的渠道是很宽的，可以看到有船在里面航行。正是这些沟渠把水引到地里，使得大地发生了一片一片的青绿。可以看出，这里土地的利用率是很高的。虽然是在冬天，但是大部分地里都种上了东西。村庄里几乎每一所房屋的屋顶都作为堆积草料的地方。因此从飞机上望去，如果不是街道和墙壁勾划出轮廓来的话，每个村庄都似乎是一片枯黄的草地。
    飞机越接近开罗，埃及人民同沙漠作斗争的情形就看得越清楚。大片的沙漠开始在绿色的田野旁边出现。在许多地方，埃及农民在沙漠上种树，用树构成一个长方形的围墙，在这个树篱里面种着果树和农作物。
    下午一时半左右，飞机在开罗机场降落。这里是一片沙漠，离开罗市本身还有很远一段路。我们走下飞机，踏上埃及的土地，觉得好像是到了自己的家一样，大大地松了一口气。五天紧张的旅行已经结束，我们将要见到英勇的埃及人民了。
    当我们在休息室里等着接我们去市区的汽车的时候，一架漆有“联合国”字样的飞机在机场降落。从飞机上下来的是“联合国紧急部队”司令伯恩斯。他板着脸孔同一名印度军官立刻走出了机场。伯恩斯是从塞得港来的。后来，“联合国紧急部队”的公共关系官员戈登在开罗宣布，伯恩斯已经同英、法侵略军队的司令商妥，英、法军队将在两三个星期以内从塞得港撤退。
    我们来得正是时候。
