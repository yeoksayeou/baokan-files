Xinhua News Agency, 29th: According to Hungarian News Agency: "People's Will" reported: Hungary is about to announce a new law regarding industry. Due to the current need to develop handicrafts, this new law will stipulate convenient conditions for issuing new licenses to artisans. At the same time, the state will also provide material assistance to artisans and small merchants.

    According to "Free People's Daily," the state will provide loans to those civil servants who were laid off due to streamlining agencies and who wish to open shops or workshops.

    "Free People's Daily" pointed out in an article on December 25: The events of October and November caused significant damage to Hungary's economy. During these two months, industrial production almost stopped, a large amount of stored goods were looted, and many residences were destroyed. During this period, Hungary practically had nothing to export, but had to import a large amount. Currently, there is a shortage of electricity and coal domestically. The inevitable consequence of this situation is the need to cut industrial production, and it is estimated that the jobs of 100,000 to 200,000 workers will be affected. In addition, due to the reduction of agencies, a large number of staff will be laid off.

    The government will take various measures to arrange for these unemployed people, including mobilizing some to participate in agricultural production, encouraging some to switch to handicraft production, and increasing miners' wages so that some can temporarily go to work in coal mines. In addition, some temporary solutions will be adopted, including implementing a six-hour work system in some industrial sectors that use more female workers, which will increase the number of workers by 33%. Finally, the government will also implement an unemployment relief system based on the recommendations of the trade unions.

    匈政府将采取措施帮助手工业和小商业
    新华社29日讯　据匈牙利通讯社讯：“人民意志报”报道：匈牙利即将公布一个工业方面的新法律。由于目前需要发展手工业，这个新法律将规定发给手工业者以新执照的便利条件。同时，国家对手工业者和小商人还将给予物质帮助。
    又据“人民自由报”报道：国家将对因精减机构后被解雇的那些希望开设商店或工场的公务人员给予贷款。
      “人民自由报”12月25日在一篇文章中指出：10月和11月的事件给匈牙利的经济造成了重大的损害。在这两个月中，工业几乎停止了生产，大量商品储存遭到抢劫，很多住宅受到了破坏。在这一时期，匈牙利实际上没有什么东西出口，但又不得不大量进口。目前国内电力和煤都感到缺乏。这种情况的必然后果就是要削减工业生产，估计将有十万或二十万劳动者的工作受到影响。另外由于裁减机构，将要有大批职员受到解雇。
    政府将采取种种措施安排这批失业者，其中包括动员一部分人参加农业生产，鼓励一部分人转入手工业生产，提高矿工工资使一部分人暂时到煤矿去工作。另外还要采取一些临时的解决办法，包括在一些使用女工较多的工业部门中实行六小时工作制，这样就可以使工人数目增加33％。最后，政府还将根据工会的建议实行失业救济金制度。
