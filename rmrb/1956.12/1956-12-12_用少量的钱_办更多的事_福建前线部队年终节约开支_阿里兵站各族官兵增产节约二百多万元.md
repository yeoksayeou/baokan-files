    Accomplishing More with Less Money
    Fujian Frontline Troops Economize at Year-End
    Officers and Soldiers of All Ethnic Groups at Ali Military Station Increase Production and Practice Thrift, Saving More Than 2 Million Yuan

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch. As the year draws to a close, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed on the Fujian front are paying close attention to economizing expenditures, preparing to turn over the surplus funds to the state.

    Starting in November, the logistics and finance departments of the leading organs of the Fujian frontline troops issued instructions separately, requiring all units to adhere to the principle of "careful calculation and strict budgeting, building the army through diligence and thrift," and to use the surplus funds rationally. Subsequently, working groups were dispatched to various units for inspection. Under the spirit of "solving more problems with less money," all units refrained from unnecessary expenditures and saved as much as possible on necessary ones. For example, troops stationed in the Mawei area urgently needed to make a batch of new straw mattresses. Later, they used old and worn-out bedsheets turned over by the troops, dismantled, washed, and repaired them, and made mattresses to replace the new ones, saving a large amount of funds for the state. A certain unit stationed in the Xiamen area, due to paying attention to the repair of old and worn-out items, saved a batch of urgently needed expenditures. In the military supplies expenditure alone, the current surplus turned over amounts to 8,000 yuan. A certain unit originally applied for 800 yuan for bicycle repair from the competent department. After inspection, it was deemed that the bicycles did not require major repairs, and this expenditure was saved.

    Currently, all units are settling surplus funds, preparing to turn them over.

    This newspaper reports that the officers and soldiers of the Ali Military Station of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have achieved significant results in increasing production and practicing thrift this year. Transportation costs have decreased by 49% compared to last year, and the total wealth increased and saved for the state throughout the year amounts to more than 2.47 million yuan.

    This transportation unit, composed of ten ethnic groups including Han, Uyghur, and Kazakh, has maintained and promoted the glorious tradition of hard struggle of the People's Liberation Army, paying attention to increasing production and practicing thrift in all aspects. Officers and soldiers of all ethnic groups used their brains to come up with methods to increase the carrying capacity of camels for long-distance transportation. The carrying capacity of each camel increased by 58 kilograms compared to last year, completing the transportation of 227,000 kilograms more materials than last year. This single item saved the state more than 1.11 million yuan. In addition, they organized livestock to graze on green grass 15 days earlier than last year, saving 1.78 million catties of fodder. Comrades especially cherished livestock equipment, utilizing various stockpiled old materials for repairs and reuse, saving the state more than 97,000 yuan. At the same time, they used spare time during transportation to go up the mountains to collect firewood themselves, basically solving the unit's annual need for firewood for heating and cooking, saving the state more than 33,500 yuan.

    用少量的钱　办更多的事
    福建前线部队年终节约开支
    阿里兵站各族官兵增产节约二百多万元
    新华社讯　年终岁尾，中国人民解放军驻福建前线部队十分注意节约开支，准备把节余的钱上缴给国家。
    从11月开始，福建前线部队领导机关的后勤部门和财务部门就分别发出指示，要求各部队本着“精打细算，勤俭建军”的原则，合理使用节余的经费，接着又派出工作组分赴各部队检查。各部队在“用少量钱，解决更多问题”的精神下，做到可开支可不开支的都不开支，需要开支的尽量节省。如驻马尾地区的部队原来急需新做一批草褥子，后来他们把部队上缴的破旧被单，经过拆洗修补，做成褥子来代替，为国家节约了一大批经费。驻厦门地区某部因为注意破旧物品的修补工作，节省了一批急需开支的经费，仅军需开支一项，目前节余上缴的就有八千元。某部原来向主管部门申请八百元自行车修理费，后来经过检查，认为自行车还不需要大修，这笔开支就省下来了。
    现在各部队正在结算节余经费，准备上缴。
    本报讯　中国人民解放军阿里兵站的官兵们今年在增产节约方面获得显著的成绩，运输成本比去年降低了49％，全年共可给国家增产节约二百四十七万多元财富。
    这支由汉、维吾尔、哈萨克等十个民族组成的运输部队，保持和发扬了人民解放军艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，从各方面注意增产节约。各族官兵们开动脑筋想办法，提高了骆驼长途运输载重量，每峰骆驼比去年提高了载重量五十八公斤，比去年多完成运输任务二十二万七千多公斤的物资，仅这一项就为国家节约了一百一十一万多元。另外，他们组织牲畜放青比去年提早十五天，节约一百七十八万斤草料。同志们对于牲畜装备特别爱护，利用各种库存旧物资修理后使用，为国家节约了九万七千多元。同时他们利用运输空隙时间，自己上山动手打柴，基本上解决了部队全年的烤火用柴和炊事用柴，为国家节约了三万三千五百多元。　（丁学恒）
