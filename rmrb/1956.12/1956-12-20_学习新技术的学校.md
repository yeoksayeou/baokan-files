    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: A pilot research class specializing in learning advanced experience in "prestressed reinforced concrete" has recently opened in Taiyuan. More than 400 engineering technicians and teachers from all over the country are participating in the study.
    The main purpose of this pilot research class is to learn the relevant technology of "prestressed reinforced concrete" which was successfully tested not long ago by the Hexi Prefabricated Factory of the North China Taiyuan Engineering Bureau. Soviet experts, professors from Tsinghua University and Taiyuan Institute of Technology, and engineers from the Academy of Building Sciences are teaching the class.
    After appraisal and trial use, it has been proved that using prestressed reinforced concrete to make components uses 61% less steel than general steel structures, and can reduce construction costs by a quarter. Authoritative experts have also affirmed that it has stronger crack resistance and can also avoid steel bars from being corroded by the outside world. The Ministry of Construction Engineering believes that this is a major technological achievement in China's construction industry and is preparing to promote it on a large scale in national capital construction projects next year.

    学习新技术的学校
    据新华社讯　一个专门学习“预应力钢筋混凝土”先进经验的试验研究班最近在太原开办。来自全国的四百多名工程技术人员、教师参加了学习。
    这个试验研究班的主要目的，是学习不久以前由华北太原工程局河西预制厂试验成功的“预应力钢筋混凝土”的有关技术。研究班由苏联专家、清华大学和太原工学院教授、建筑科学研究院的工程师任教。
    经过鉴定和试用证明，用预应力钢筋混凝土制作构件比一般钢结构少用61％的钢材，可以使建筑造价降低四分之一。权威的专家们还肯定：它的抗裂性也比较强，还可以避免钢筋受外界侵蚀。建筑工程部认为这是我国建筑工业上的一件重大的技术成就，准备明年在全国基本建设工程中大规模推广。
