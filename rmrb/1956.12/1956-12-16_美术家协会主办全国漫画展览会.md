    Art Association Sponsors National Cartoon Exhibition

    (Our Newspaper) News: The "National Cartoon Exhibition" sponsored by the Chinese Artists Association opened today at the Capital Art Exhibition Hall. A total of 321 works are on display, including works by 147 authors from 21 cities across the country. Most of these works have been published in newspapers and periodicals.

    From the exhibited works, we can see the development of cartoon creation in the year since the "Second National Art Exhibition" last year. Major domestic and international events of the past year are reflected in the works. Works with the theme of praising new things and exposing unreasonable things on the road forward also account for a considerable proportion. The forms of expression are also more diverse than in the past, with many works using traditional Chinese painting, watercolor, collage, airbrushing, and sketching techniques. In addition to the large number of young authors, veteran cartoonists such as Feng Zikai also participated with their works.

    The exhibition is scheduled to close on January 6, 1957. (Yí Lái)

    美术家协会主办全国漫画展览会
    本报讯　中国美术家协会主办的“全国漫画展览会”今天在首都美术展览馆举行，展出作品共三百二十一件，包括全国二十一个城市的作者一百四十七人。这些作品大都是在报纸刊物上发表过的。
    从展出的作品中，可以看出漫画创作从去年“第二届全国美术展览会”一年来的发展情况。一年来国内外发生的重大事件，在作品中都有所反映。以歌颂新鲜事物、揭露前进道路上不合理事物为题材的作品，也占了相当比重。表现形式也较过去多样，用国画、水彩、剪贴、喷染和素描等手法来描绘的作品很多。除广大青年作者外，丰子恺等老漫画家也有作品参加。
    展览会预订于1957年1月6日闭幕。　　　　　　　　（贻来）
