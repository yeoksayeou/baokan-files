　　The Current State of the British Workers' Movement
　　Xie Wenxuan
    The British working class's struggle for peace, social progress, and living rights has developed. The strike struggles of British workers in 1955 were the highest since the war. The number of strikers reached 670,900, second only to 1953. The working days lost due to strikes amounted to 3,794,000, an increase of 54% compared to 1954, which was the highest record since the war. In the first ten months of this year, according to materials from the British "Ministry of Labour Gazette," a total of 2,284 strikes occurred, involving 473,100 people. The largest of these was the major strike by auto workers in July, involving nearly 50,000 people.
    The development of strike struggles in Britain is the result of the strengthening of the working class's united struggle, under the conditions of increasingly serious economic difficulties caused by the British government's implementation of policies of military expansion and suppression of national independence movements, and the increasing absolute and relative impoverishment of the British working class.
    Since the serious financial and economic crisis in Britain in the second half of last year, Britain has not overcome the difficulties by substantially reducing military expenditures and abandoning the policy of suppressing national independence movements. Instead, it has continued to implement measures to tighten the belts of the people, freezing wages, restricting consumption and credit, raising taxes, and abolishing subsidies for bread and housing, etc.; attempting to increase "starvation exports" to save the crisis. However, these measures have failed to improve the current financial and economic situation. Although export trade has increased somewhat this year, the trade deficit remains large. According to materials published in the June issue of the British Treasury's publication "Public Industry Gazette," its share of world trade has decreased from 20.4% in 1954 to 19.8%. At the same time, inflation continues to worsen. According to official data, the retail price index on May 15 this year was 157 (with the retail price level on June 7, 1947, as 100), four points higher than in January this year. By the end of September, the price of bread alone had risen by 15% to 20%.
    After Britain, in collusion with France, launched the invasion of Egypt, the oil crisis caused by the interruption of navigation in the Suez Canal has further deteriorated the British economy. Britain's gold and dollar reserves decreased by $279 million in November alone, falling below the dangerous point of $2 billion. In order to cope with this serious crisis, in addition to requesting the United States and Canada to allow Britain to defer the loan interest due on December 1, the British government is also preparing to raise tariffs on gasoline and other light hydrocarbon oils, and sell a large amount of dollar securities. Under these circumstances, prices have already risen accordingly.
    The lives of the British working people have been severely threatened. Workers' real wages are constantly declining. In 1955, prices rose by 50% compared to 1947, and wages increased by 51%. However, the price of food, which occupies a major position in workers' lives, increased by more than 20% higher than the rate of wage increase. As a result of enterprises implementing "automation" and increasing labor intensity, the threat of unemployment and underemployment is becoming increasingly serious. Since the beginning of this year, Standard Motor Company, British Motor Corporation, and Ford Motor Company have successively laid off more than 12,000 workers. At the "Roots Motors Company" in Coventry, 6,000 workers have been working only four days a week since March 2. Similar situations exist in enterprises producing radios, televisions, household appliances, and furniture. At the same time, workers' working hours have greatly increased. Although the stipulated weekly working hours in various industries and enterprises in Britain are 44 hours, the actual weekly working hours in most industrial sectors reach more than 50 hours. The oil crisis brought about by the war of aggression against Egypt is making the British working class face the prospect of increased unemployment. According to Harry Urwin, secretary of the Coventry district organization of the Amalgamated Society of Shipbuilding and Engineering Draughtsmen, approximately 20,000 workers at Coventry's auto factories will have to implement partial shutdowns in the next two weeks. Many enterprises are attempting to cope with the reduction in production caused by the oil crisis by shortening the workweek and reducing wages.
    With the deterioration of living conditions and the increase in the number of unemployed and underemployed, the British working people's struggle for living rights has become even more vigorous. The number of people demanding wage increases at the beginning of this year reached 9 million (compared to 7 million last year). After the invasion of Egypt, due to rising living costs, the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the National Union of Railwaymen, the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, the National Union of Bank Employees, and the Transport and General Workers' Union, organizations with more than 6 million members, are working hard to fight for wage increases. Strikes have broken out one after another. Workers in Coventry, Belfast, South Wales, Scotland, Birmingham, and London have successively held strikes and demonstrations to fight for wage increases. On October 25, more than 1,000 miners each in Whitburn in County Durham and Darfield in South Yorkshire went on strike to fight for wage increases and improved working conditions; 350 workers at the atomic power plant in Caithness also went on strike.
    In April this year, 11,000 workers at Coventry's "Standard Motor Company" launched Britain's first strike against layoffs due to "automation," protesting the company's decision to lay off 3,000 workers during the summer months. This strike attracted great attention from public opinion in various countries. Because in countries such as the United States, France, and West Germany, the widespread adoption of "automation" by enterprises has also brought the same disastrous consequences to the working people.
    The historically significant and largest-scale British auto workers' strike that broke out on July 23 was a further development of the Coventry auto workers' strike. Nearly 50,000 workers participated in the strike, protesting the British Motor Corporation's behavior of laying off 6,000 workers without consulting the union in advance and without paying subsidies. No excuse from the capitalists could deceive the workers. The vast majority of auto workers clearly saw the truth exposed by this large-scale layoff incident. After the war, the British auto industry developed faster than other industrial sectors, with production increasing by almost 300%, and capitalists obtained higher profits than ever before. According to statistics, in the first half of 1956, the profits of 58 auto and aircraft manufacturing companies increased by 13%, from more than 60.03 million pounds last year to more than 68.08 million pounds. However, due to the increasing competition faced by Britain, the sluggish sales of automobiles, and the significant shrinking of the domestic market, British monopoly capital groups, in order to maintain their high profits, planned to attack the working class, causing a serious phenomenon of mass unemployment and underemployment.
    The consequences of automation under the capitalist system threaten the entire British working class. According to estimates by some British experts, the adoption of new technologies in basic industries will lead to the layoff of nearly 2 million workers. Therefore, the major strike by auto workers at the British Motor Corporation this time received strong support and assistance from workers in all industries across the country. Although the strike only achieved a partial victory, it was a victory of great significance for the entire British workers' movement.
    The annual meeting of the British Trades Union Congress held in September this year prominently reflected the "leftward turn" trend of the trade unions, forcing the right-wing leadership group to make concessions on some important domestic and foreign policy issues, thereby passing some resolutions that were in line with the interests of the British working people and conducive to the further easing of the international situation. For example, the resolution against freezing wages passed by the Trades Union Congress annual meeting was a significant event. Because opposing the freezing of wages is the central issue in the British working class's struggle after the war. At this annual meeting, the proposal was passed unanimously. The same resolution was also passed at this year's Labour Party annual meeting, and the Labour Party's right-wing leadership group was forced to disagree with the Conservative government's policy on this issue. These two annual meetings showed that the right-wing leadership group is increasingly unable to control the development of the British trade union movement.
    The British working class is increasingly clearly aware from real life that in order to fundamentally improve Britain's economic situation and raise the living standards of the working people, it is necessary to strive to change Britain's current domestic and foreign policies. The British working class's struggle for its own economic interests is also becoming increasingly closely linked with political struggles. The voices of the vast British working people opposing the current financial and economic measures of tightening the belts of the people, demanding peace, and opposing war are also rising. This year, many British trade union annual meetings passed resolutions demanding the reduction of armaments, the prohibition of atomic weapons, the withdrawal of British and American troops stationed in Britain, the lifting of embargoes, the development of East-West trade, and the promotion of international trade union solidarity and the end of colonial rule. Recently, workers in various parts of Britain have successively demanded general strikes to force the government to stop the dirty war against Egypt. Many large trade unions and regional committees have pledged to support the movement launched by the National Labour Conference under the slogan "Law, not War." Many trade union organizations have demanded the convening of a special meeting of the Trades Union Congress in order to pass resolutions to hold strikes to protest the aggression against Egypt. After Britain and France were forced to cease fire in Egypt, the vast majority of the British people demanded the immediate withdrawal of British and French troops from Egypt. This struggle of the British working people played a significant role in forcing Britain to cease fire and withdraw its troops.
    The development of the British workers' movement for peace, prosperity, and socialism is an obstacle to Britain's policy of promoting military suppression of national independence movements and embarking on war adventures, and is an important factor in promoting the cause of world peace and democracy.

　　英国工人运动现况
　　谢文煊
    英国工人阶级为争取和平、社会进步和生活权利的斗争，已有了发展。1955年英国工人的罢工斗争，是战后最高涨的一年，罢工人数达六十七万零九百人，仅次于1953年，而因罢工损失的工作日则达三百七十九万四千个，比1954年增加了54％，是战后的最高纪录。今年头十个月，据英国“劳工部公报”的材料，一共发生了二千二百八十四次罢工，参加罢工的人数达四十七万三千一百人。其中规模最大的一次是7月汽车工人的大罢工，参加罢工的将近五万人。
    英国罢工斗争的发展，乃是在英国政府实行扩军备战和镇压民族独立运动的政策引起日益严重的经济困难，和英国工人阶级绝对和相对贫穷化日益加剧的情况下，工人阶级团结斗争加强的结果。
    自从去年下半年英国财政经济发生严重危机以来，英国仍旧没有从大量削减军费开支、放弃镇压民族独立运动的政策来克服困难，而是继续实行束紧人民腰带的办法，冻结工资，限制消费和信贷，提高税收，取消面包、房屋津贴等等；企图借此增加“饥饿输出”，挽救危机。但是这种措施，并未能改善目前的财政经济状况。今年出口贸易虽有些增加，但入超数字仍然很大，在世界贸易中所占的分额，根据英国财政部机关刊物“公业公报”6月号所公布的材料，已从1954年的20.4％降低到19.8％。同时通货膨胀仍继续恶化。根据官方材料，今年5月15日零售价格的指数是157（以1947年6月7日零售价格的水平为一百）比今年1月高四点。9月底仅面包价格就上涨了15％到20％。
    英国伙同法国发动侵埃战争后，由于苏伊士运河航运中断而造成的石油危机，已使得英国经济更加恶化了。英国的黄金美元储备仅在11月份就已减少了二亿七千九百万美元，落到了二十亿美元的危险点以下。英国政府为了应付这种严重的危机，除已要求美国、加拿大准英国免付12月1日到期的贷款利息以外，还准备提高汽油和其他轻碳化氢油的关税，出卖大量美元证券。在这种情况下，物价已在随之上涨。
    英国劳动人民的生活遭到了严重的威胁。工人的实际工资不断下降，在1955年，物价较1947年上涨了50％，工资提高了51％，但占工人生活主要地位的食品价格却比工资增加比率高20％以上。由于各企业实行“自动化”，加强劳动强度的结果，失业和半失业的威胁日益严重。今年以来，标准汽车公司、英国汽车公司和福特汽车公司先后解雇了近一万二千多名工人。考文垂“鲁斯汽车公司”从3月2日起有六千名工人每周只能工作四天。在无线电和电视家庭用具家具等企业中亦有类似情况。同时，工人的工作时间大为增加，英国各产业和企业部门虽然规定每周工作时间为四十四小时，但在大部分工业部门中每周实际工作时数达五十小时以上。由于侵略埃及的战争而带来的石油危机正在使英国工人阶级面临着失业增加的前景。据英国造船工人及机械工业工人工会联合会考文垂地区组织的书记哈理·欧文说，考文垂汽车工厂大约二万名工人在今后两周内就要实行部分停工。许多企业正在企图用缩短工作周和减少工资的办法来应付因石油危机而引起的生产减缩。
    随着生活的恶化，失业和半失业人数的增加，英国劳动人民争取生活权利的斗争，就更加高涨起来。今年年初要求提高工资斗争的人数达九百万（去年为七百万）。侵埃战争后，由于生活费用上涨，拥有六百多万会员的机器工人工会，铁路工人工会、造船工人工会、银行职员工会、运输工会等组织正在为争取增加工资而努力。罢工运动此伏彼起。考文垂、培尔法斯特、南威尔士、苏格兰、伯明翰和伦敦等地的工人，都为争取提高工资相继举行了罢工和示威游行。10月25日，为争取提高工资和改善劳动条件而举行罢工的就有达勒姆郡维特堡和南约克郡达菲尔的矿工各一千多人；凯特纳斯郡省里的原子能发电站工人三百五十人也举行了罢工。
    今年4月考文垂“标准汽车公司”的一万一千名工人爆发了英国第一次反对因
  “自动化”而解雇工人的罢工，抗议公司将在夏季几个月中解雇三千名工人的决定。这次罢工引起了各国舆论的极大注意。因为，在美国、法国、西德等国家里，各企业普遍采取“自动化”，也给劳动人民带来了同样的灾难性后果。
    7月23日爆发的具有历史意义的英国规模最大的汽车工人罢工，乃是考文垂汽车工人罢工的进一步发展。参加罢工的近五万工人，抗议英国汽车公司事先没有和工会商量，也不付给补助金就解雇六千名工人的行为。资方的任何借口，都不能蒙骗工人。广大汽车工人清楚地看到了这种大规模解雇工人事件所暴露的事实真相。战后英国汽车工业比其他各工业部门发展得都快，生产几乎增加了300％，资本家所得的利润比以往任何时期都高。据统计，1956年上半年五十八家汽车和飞机制造公司的利润增加了13％，从去年的六千零三十多万英镑，增加到了六千八百多万英镑。但由于英国遭到的竞争日益增强，汽车滞销情况严重，国内市场又大大缩小，英国垄断资本集团为了保持自己的高额利润，便有计划地向工人阶级进攻，造成了大批工人失业和半失业的严重现象。
    自动化在资本主义制度下产生的后果，威胁着整个英国工人阶级。据英国某些专家的估计在基本工业中新技术的采用将导致近二百万工人的解雇。因此，这次英国汽车公司汽车工人的大罢工，得到了全国各业工人的强有力的支持和援助。罢工虽然只取得了局部的胜利，但对整个英国工人运动来说，是一次具有很大意义的胜利。
    今年9月召开的英国职工大会年会突出地反映了工会“向左转”的趋势，迫使右翼领导集团不得不在一些重要的内政外交政策问题上让步，从而通过了一些符合于英国劳动人民利益和有利于国际局势进一步缓和的决议。例如，职工大会年会通过的反对冻结工资的决议，就是具有意义的事。因为反对冻结工资是战后英国工人阶级斗争的中心问题。在这届年会上，这个提案获得了一致通过。在今年的工党年会上也通过了相同的决议，工党右翼领导集团被迫在这个问题上同保守党政府的政策发生分歧。这两个年会表明了右翼领导集团已愈来愈不能控制英国工会运动的发展了。
    英国工人阶级从现实生活中日益清楚地认识到，要根本改善英国的经济状况，提高劳动人民的生活水平，必须争取改变英国的现行国内外政策。英国工人阶级为争取切身的经济利益的斗争也就日益与政治斗争密切地结合起来。英国广大劳动人民反对目前束紧人民腰带的财政经济措施，要求和平、反对战争的呼声也日益高涨起来。今年英国许多工会年会通过了要求裁减军备、禁止原子武器、撤退驻英美军、解除禁运、发展东西方贸易和促进国际工会团结和结束殖民统治等决议。最近英国各地工人纷纷要求举行总罢工来迫使政府停止对埃及的肮脏战争。许多大工会和区域委员会保证支持全国劳工会议在“要法律不要战争”的口号下发动的运动。许多工会组织要求召开职工大会特别会议以便通过决议，为抗议对埃及的侵略而举行罢工。英法在埃及被迫停火后，英国广大人民要求英法军队立即撤出埃及。英国劳动人民的这个斗争，在迫使英国停火和撤军方面起了很大的作用。
    英国争取和平、繁荣和社会主义的工人运动的发展，是英国推行武力镇压民族独立运动，走向战争冒险的政策的障碍，是促进世界和平民主事业的重要因素。
