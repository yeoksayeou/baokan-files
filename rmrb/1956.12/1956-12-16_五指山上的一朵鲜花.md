    A Fresh Flower on Wuzhi Mountain

    We left Tongshi, the capital of the Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture of Hainan Island, to visit Fanmao Village, not far away, the first advanced agricultural production cooperative of the Li ethnic group on Hainan Island - Fanmao Agricultural Production Cooperative.
    Like many villages on Hainan Island, Fanmao Village is surrounded by dense tropical plants: cassava trees, betel nut trees, papaya trees, coconut trees... and various trees that we can't name, like a green screen surrounding the village. It is said that this is to protect the village from typhoon attacks. We walked through the woods to the entrance of the village, where several comrades from the cooperative were already waiting to greet us. They took us to a fairly large grass house. It seemed that this was the office of the cooperative, with walls covered with silk banners. The Fanmao Cooperative is not only famous as the earliest Li ethnic agricultural cooperative established on Hainan Island, but also for its excellent production performance. It has received many awards, and in 1955 it was rated as a first-class model agricultural cooperative in Guangdong Province. These silk banners are records of their honors.
    The most attractive thing about the Fanmao Agricultural Production Cooperative is that it was established on the basis of the "He Mu System," a production method similar to a primitive commune that was once prevalent among the Li people in the Wuzhi Mountain area. From the "He Mu System" to the socialist advanced cooperative, several historical stages were crossed. How did the Li brothers in Fanmao Village complete this historical leap? What is their current living situation like? These are questions that everyone is very interested in. Right in the big grass house, Wang Yuanchang, the director of the cooperative, gave us an interesting talk.
    "Before the establishment of the cooperative, our entire village practiced the 'He Mu System.' Taking the family as a unit, everyone worked together and distributed the produce equally according to the number of people. Each unit is a 'Mu.' Each 'Mu' has a 'Mu Head,' who is appointed by the elders of the family. Our village used to have four 'Mu Heads,' and I was one of them.
    "In December 1954, three 'Mu' and one individual household in our village directly formed a primary agricultural cooperative, and I was elected as the director. The cooperative increased production by 35% in the first year, winning a great victory. In January of this year, during the upsurge of the agricultural cooperation movement, many 'Mu' from neighboring villages requested to join, and it expanded into a large cooperative with forty-two 'Mu' combined. Now our cooperative includes seven nearby villages, with a total of one hundred and fifty-eight households.
    "The Li people are very happy to participate in the cooperative because we have a habit of collective production. There are not many troubles caused by private ownership, as in the Han areas, here. But we also encountered many special difficulties. For example, the Li people have a custom that about ten days a month are called 'Taboo Days.' On 'Taboo Days,' they don't work in the fields, saying that going to the fields will bring disaster. People in our village were afraid that they would have to work in the fields even on 'Taboo Days' after joining the cooperative, so they didn't dare to join at first. Therefore, we had to accommodate their superstitious ideas at first and not work in the fields on 'Taboo Days.' Later, the advanced elements in the cooperative used their own experiences to eliminate everyone's superstition. Comrade Wang Daocai and I secretly worked on 'Taboo Days' first, and no 'disaster' befell us. Later, we openly cultivated the land on a 'Taboo Day,' and everyone came to watch after hearing about it, and indeed nothing happened afterward. We also explained to everyone the loss caused by not working on 'Taboo Days.' Everyone's thinking gradually improved. Now, members of our cooperative work as usual on 'Taboo Days.' However, in other Li ethnic cooperatives, this problem has not been completely resolved.
    "When the cooperative was first organized, some 'Mu Heads' also had concerns. They were afraid that their income would decrease after joining the cooperative. The cooperative temporarily retained the 'Rice Public' system (that is, at harvest time, the 'Mu Head' would be given an extra handful of grain per Mu). Later, the cooperative's production increased rapidly, and everyone's income increased, the 'Mu Heads' were relieved, and the 'Rice Public' system was abolished.
    "Low cultural level is also a great difficulty. We couldn't find anyone in our village who could keep accounts. Later, the government sent two cadres to help, and at the same time, established a spare-time school to train work recorders. It just so happened that three Li people from the People's Liberation Army were demobilized and returned. They had learned some culture in the army and served as work recorders in the cooperative."
    Wang Yuanchang, the director of the cooperative, concluded, "The difficulties mentioned above are all things of the past. Now, the important work of our cooperative is to reform agricultural technology and ensure increased grain production. This is another big thing. I will take you to see it, and you will understand."
    We left the cooperative's office to visit the cooperative's crops and see the agricultural technology reforms they were carrying out.
    We walked along the field ridges, and on both sides were good rice crops, heavy and drooping, waiting to be harvested, shining golden in the setting sun. Groups of Li women wearing pointed straw hats and necklaces around their necks were harvesting with sickles in an unskilled manner, and bursts of crisp laughter came from the fields. On the edge of the field, a comrade from the cooperative told me that they were all novices who had just learned to use sickles. In the past, the Li people in this area did not use sickles to harvest rice, but twisted the rice by hand. Nine people could only twist one Mu a day. Now, by using sickles, even though they are not yet proficient, it only takes three people to harvest one Mu of rice a day. He said: The Li people in this area retain many backward production habits similar to twisting rice by hand, which are now being gradually changed. For example, in the past, they did not use plows to cultivate the fields, but adopted the method of "using cattle to tread the fields," pulling a large group of cattle into the fields to trample the mud, and then transplanting seedlings for cultivation. Now they have all used plows and implemented three plowing and three harrowing. In the past, weeds and rice grew together in the paddy fields. Now they have begun to use cultivators to weed, weeding two or three times a season. They also use yellow mud water to select seeds and 666 powder to kill insects. In the past, there was no water conservancy irrigation for planting, nor was fertilizer applied. When planting early rice this year, they learned for the first time to use human manure to fertilize the fields. The cooperative also excavated the first irrigation canal, which can irrigate more than 1,000 Mu of land.
    Cooperativization coupled with agricultural technology reform seems to have restored the land to its youth. In the past, one Mu of land could often only harvest a hundred or so catties of grain; the first season of early rice after the establishment of the cooperative harvested 191 catties per Mu; this year's early rice harvested 283 catties per Mu, a real increase of more than double.
   "This season's late rice will be even better," Wang Yuanchang looked at the golden rice bending in front of him, his eyes shining with pleasant brilliance, and said, "I think this rice will yield 400 catties per Mu, no problem."
    We stopped in front of a granary of the cooperative on the edge of the village. It was a small grass house, with several rows of bamboo shelves erected in the room, hanging with strings of yellow ears of grain, and the ground was scattered with fallen grains.
    Most of the Li people in this area do not have grain warehouses. After twisting the rice, they hang it in strings on a high bamboo shelf at the door. When they want to eat, they take it at any time. On the way to Tongshi, we saw several such "open-air grains," which do not need to be guarded against theft (the Li people do not steal the fruits of other people's labor), but birds come to eat them. Therefore, half of the grain on the shelf is often eaten by people and half by birds; in addition, wind and rain blow, and the waste of grain is very large. Now, the granary of the Fanmao Cooperative has been moved into the house, which is a big step forward. It is a pity that this practice has not been widely promoted among Li farmers.
    We took a tour of this small Li village and also visited the homes of several cooperative members. The life of the Li people is obviously still very simple. The houses are extremely small and have no windows. They don't even have fixed stoves, they only use a few bricks temporarily to support cooking. Backwardness and poverty have not completely left them. But the comrades of the cooperative said: The life of the people in Fanmao Village today is much better than it used to be. Before liberation, the Li people in Fanmao Village lived an inhuman life, often threatened by hunger and cold. After liberation, especially after the organization of the cooperative, income has generally increased and life has greatly improved. In the past, there was not a single tent in the village, now most people have mosquito nets (in the Wuzhi Mountain area, there are malarial mosquitoes in all seasons, and tents are the most important necessities of life). In the past, many people had no clothes to wear and were naked all year round. Now everyone has clothes. In the past, cooking was done in earthenware pots, now every family has iron pots. In the past, there were few or no quilts to cover. Now every family has bought new quilts. In the past, water was carried in earthenware jars. Now 25 households have buckets. In the past, they never bought vegetables to eat. Now they often run to Tongshi in twos and threes to buy salted fish and vegetables to eat. There are now four Li children from the village studying in Tongshi. These are the first students to appear in the village. ... The comrades of the cooperative introduced us to these changes in their lives in a proud and excited tone, as if counting their treasures, and kept pointing out to us which were newly built houses and which were newly bought farm tools.
    The sun has disappeared behind the jungle of Wuzhi Mountain. Because we had to rush back to Tongshi, we said goodbye to this group of enthusiastic Li brothers on the edge of the village. It was completely dark not long after we left the village. Looking at Tongshi City in the distance, this new city on Wuzhi Mountain has lit up its electric lights, and a white light illuminates the night sky of Wuzhi Mountain. (Attached picture)

    五指山上的一朵鲜花
    季音
    我们离开了海南岛黎族苗族自治州的首府通什，去不远的番茅村访问海南岛第一个黎族高级农业生产合作社——番茅农业生产合作社。
    像海南岛的许多村庄一样，番茅村的周围全是一片密密的热带植物，木薯树、槟榔树、木瓜树、椰子树……，以及各种我们叫不出名的树木，像一座绿色的屏风把村庄围在中间。据说，这是为了保护村庄不受台风的袭击。我们穿过树林，走到村口上，合作社的几位同志已经迎出来了。他们把我们带到一间相当大的草房子里。看来这里是合作社的办公室，四壁上挂满了锦旗。番茅合作社不只是因为它是海南岛最早成立的黎族农业社而闻名，同时也以它的优异的生产成绩而闻名，它曾得到过许多次奖励，1955年它又被评为广东省一等模范农业社。这些锦旗，都是他们的荣誉的记录。
    番茅农业生产合作社最吸引人的是：它是在“合亩制”的基础上建立起来的一个高级社。“合亩制”是一种近似原始公社的生产方式，过去普遍流行在五指山区的黎族人民中间。从“合亩制”到社会主义性质的高级社，跨越了几个历史阶段。番茅村的黎族弟兄们是怎样完成这个历史的飞跃的呢？他们现在的生活情况又是怎样？这是大家很感兴趣的问题。就在大草房里，合作社社长王元昌给我们作了一次有趣的谈话。
    “在成立合作社以前，我们全村都是实行‘合亩制’的。以家族为单位，大家共同劳动，按人平均分配。一个单位就是一个‘亩’。每个‘亩’有一个‘亩头’，这个‘亩头’都由家族里的长辈来担任。我们村过去有四个‘亩头’，我就是当中的一个。
    “1954年12月，我们村的三个‘亩’和一户单干户，直接组成了一个初级农业社，我被大家推选为社长。合作社成立第一年就增产35％，打了一个大胜仗。今年1月，在农业合作化运动的高潮中，许多邻村的‘亩’都要求加入，就扩大为四十二个‘亩’联合的大社。现在我们的社包括附近的七个村，共有一百五十八户。
    “黎族人对参加合作社都很高兴，因为我们本来就有集体生产的习惯。在汉族地区那些因为私有观念而引起的麻烦事，在我们这里不多。但我们也碰到了许多特殊的困难。例如我们黎族人有一种风俗，一个月中约有十天被叫做‘忌日’，逢‘忌日’都不出工，说是下田就会碰到灾祸。我们村里人害怕参加合作社以后‘忌日’也要下地劳动，所以开头都不敢参加。因此，在最初不得不迁就他们的这种迷信思想，‘忌日’不下田。后来合作社里的先进分子，用亲身的事实来消除大家的迷信。我和社员王道才两个人，先在‘忌日’里偷偷地干活，并没有什么‘灾祸’降身；以后我们就公开在一个‘忌日’里下地耕作，大家听说后都赶来看，过后果然平安无事。我们又把“忌日”不下地的损失账算给大家听。大家的思想渐渐通了。现在我们社里逢‘忌日’社员都照常劳动。不过在别的黎族社里，这个问题还没有完全解决。
    “最初组织合作社的时候，有些‘亩头’也有顾虑，他们怕入社后收入会减少。社里便暂时保留了‘稻公’制度（即在收获的时候，每亩地多分给‘亩头’一把谷）。后来合作社增产很快，大家收入都有增加，‘亩头’安心了，‘稻公’制度就取消了。
    “文化低也是一个极大的困难。我们村里找不出一个能记分算账的人。后来政府派了两个干部来帮助，同时建立了业余学校，训练记工员。正巧这时候有解放军里的三个黎族人复员回来了，他们在部队里学了一些文化，便担任了社里的记工员。”
    社长王元昌最后说：“上面说的这些困难，都已经是过去的事了。现在，我们合作社的重要工作是改革农业技术，保证增产粮食。这是又一件大事情，我带你们去看一看，你们就会明白的。”
    我们离开了合作社的办公室，去参观社里的庄稼，看他们正在进行的农业技术改革工作。
    我们沿着田垅走去，两旁都是沉甸甸的垂着头等待收割的好稻子，在夕阳里金光闪闪。一群群头戴尖顶斗笠、脖上套着项圈的黎族妇女，不熟练地挥舞着镰刀在收割，田间传出了一阵阵清脆的笑声。在田边上，合作社的一位同志告诉我，她们都是才学会用镰刀的新手。过去这一带黎族割稻都不用镰刀，而是用手捻稻，九个人一天只能捻一亩。现在改用镰刀，虽然还不熟练，一天割一亩稻子只要三个人就够了。他说：这一带黎族人民中保留着不少类似用手捻稻的落后生产习惯，现在正在逐步地改变。例如，过去他们耕田都不用犁，而是采取“用牛踏田”的办法，把一大群牛拉到田里，把泥踩烂，然后插秧耕种。现在他们已经全部用犁，实行三耕三耙。过去稻田里青草和稻子一齐长，现在已经开始用中耕器除草，一季稻要除草两三次。他们还用黄泥水选种，用666粉杀虫。过去种地没有什么水利灌溉，也不施肥。今年种早稻的时候，他们第一次学会了用人粪肥田。社里还开掘了第一条灌溉水道，它可以灌溉一千多亩地。
    合作化加上农业技术改革，仿佛使土地恢复了青春。过去，这里一亩地常常只能收到百来斤谷物；成立合作社以后的第一季早稻，每亩就收了一百九十一斤；今年的早稻每亩收到了二百八十三斤，实足增加了一倍。
   “这一季晚稻还要好，”王元昌展望着眼前一片金黄地弯倒着的稻子，眼睛里亮着愉快的光采，他说，“我看这稻子一亩打四百斤没问题。”
    我们在村边合作社的一座谷仓前停了下来。这是一座小小的草房，屋子里竖着几排竹架子，架子上挂着一串串黄色的谷穗，地上撒满了掉下来的谷子。
    这一带黎族人民大都没有粮食仓库，他们把稻子捻下来后，就一串串地挂在门口一个高高的竹架子上，要吃的时候就随时去取。我们在来通什的路上，曾经看到好几处这种“露天粮食”，它不用提防有人来偷窃（黎族人是不偷别人的劳动果实的），但却有鸟雀来吃。因此，架上的粮食常常是人吃一半，鸟吃一半；再加风雨的吹打，粮食的浪费很大。现在，番茅合作社的谷仓已搬到屋子里面来了，这是一个很大的进步。可惜这个做法还没有在黎族农民中普遍推行。
    我们在这个小小的黎族村庄里走了一转，还去看了几户社员的家庭。黎族人民的生活显然还是很简陋的，房子都异常矮小，没有窗户。他们甚至还没有固定的炉灶，只用几块砖临时支起来烧饭。落后和贫困还没有完全离开他们。但合作社的同志说：番茅村人民今天的生活，比过去不知道已经好了多少倍了。解放前，番茅村黎族人民过的简直不是人的生活，经常受饥寒的威胁。解放以后，尤其是组织合作社以后，收入普遍增加，生活大大好转了。过去村上没有一顶帐子，现在大都有了蚊帐（在五指山区，四季都有疟蚊，帐子是最重要的生活用品）。过去许多人没有衣服穿，终年赤身露体，现在每人都有了衣服。过去烧饭用瓦盆，现在家家都有了铁锅。过去没有或很少被子盖，现在家家都买了新被。过去提水用瓦罐，现在有二十五户已经用水桶了。过去从来没有过买菜吃的事情，现在常常三三两两的跑到通什，去买咸鱼、青菜吃。村子里现在有四个黎族孩子在通什上学，这是村子里第一批出现的学生。……合作社的同志用骄傲、激奋的口吻，如数家珍似地滔滔不绝地向我们介绍他们生活中的这些变化，并且不断地指点给我们看，哪些是新修的房子，哪些又是刚买的农具。
    太阳已经消失在五指山的丛林后边。我们因为还要赶回通什去，便在村边和这群热情的黎族兄弟们告别。走出村不久，天全黑了。远望通什市，这座五指山上的新城市已经亮起了电灯，一片白色的灯光照耀着五指山的夜空。（附图片）
