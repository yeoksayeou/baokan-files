Xinhua News Agency, December 18th dispatch from Paris: The French Ministry of Finance announced that liquid fuel prices would be increased starting from the 17th. Gasoline prices have increased by 9%, with a selling price of seventy-three francs per liter. At the same time, the prices of kerosene and other petroleum products have also increased significantly. Newspapers pointed out that liquid fuel prices have already risen four times this year.

French Finance Minister Ramadier said that the reason for increasing liquid fuel prices is because detours around the Cape of Good Hope and transporting oil from the Western Hemisphere have increased freight costs. According to reports, transporting oil from the Persian Gulf around the Cape of Good Hope is six times more expensive than transporting it through the Suez Canal. As for the freight costs of oil from the Gulf of Mexico, they have increased by about two times since the outbreak of the Suez Canal crisis.

    法国提高石油价格
    据新华社18日讯　巴黎消息：法国财政部宣布，从17日起提高液体燃料价格。汽油价格提高了9％，每公升售价为七十三法郎。同时，煤油和其他石油产品的价格也大大上涨。报纸指出，在今年，液体燃料已经涨价四次了。
    法国财政部长拉马第埃说，所以要提高液体燃料价格，是因为绕道好望角以及从西半球运来石油使运费增加。据报道，从波斯湾绕道好望角运来石油，运费要比经过苏伊士运河运来贵六倍。至于来自墨西哥湾的石油的运费，从苏伊士运河危机爆发以来已经增加了约两倍。
