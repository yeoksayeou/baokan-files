　　Significant Change in Work Style

    (Our report) Since studying the "Eight Greats" documents and the provincial party representative conference's resolution on "Opposing Bureaucracy, Upholding the Mass Line," the leadership style of the agricultural and animal husbandry science staff in Pingshun County, Shanxi, has undergone a significant change.

    In the past, the agricultural and animal husbandry science department regarded issuing documents as a
  "magic weapon." Whether assigning tasks or guiding work, they often relied on sitting in the office to write notices and issue instructions. After the documents were issued to the townships and communities, some grassroots cadres, due to their limited education level, locked them in their drawers without even reading them. From August to October of this year, the agricultural and animal husbandry science department issued a total of thirty documents to townships and communities, including notices, instructions, circulars, plans, programs, and experience introductions, averaging one document every three days. Among them, the proclamation on "Protecting Autumn Harvest" was only issued when the autumn crops were generally harvested, and the masses sarcastically said: "The crops are all harvested, what is there to protect!"

    After studying, they adopted a leadership method of facing the masses, going deep into the grassroots, and providing specific guidance, which brought many benefits to the work. During the autumn harvest, Fan Yongming, the deputy section chief, went deep into the Beidan Che Township, summarized the high-yield experience of millet and sweet potatoes and the experience of fine seed selection work of the "Jianguo" agricultural cooperative, and disseminated it in a timely manner. During this period, Sang Fuyou, the section chief, also led a roving inspection team to the countryside, discovered the phenomenon of rough autumn harvesting and neglect of autumn plowing, and helped to correct it in a timely manner. Now, everyone's work confidence is even higher. (Guo Jianzhong)

    山西平顺县农牧科工作人员
　　工作作风有了显著转变
    本报讯　山西平顺县农牧科的工作人员，自从学习了“八大”文件和省党代表会议关于“反对官僚主义，坚持群众路线”的决议后，领导作风有了显著的改变。
    过去，农牧科把发文件当成了
  “法宝”。不管是布置任务或指导工作，常常是依靠坐在办公室里写通知发指示。文件下达乡、社以后，某些基层干部因为文化水平所限，不看完就锁到抽屉里了。今年的8至10月间，农牧科向乡、社发出的通知、指示、通报、计划、方案，经验介绍等文件共达三十件，平均三天发一件。其中的关于“护秋”的布告，到大秋作物普遍收割开了才发出，群众讥讽说：“庄稼收完了，还护什么秋！”
    在学习以后，他们采取了面向群众、深入基层、进行具体指导的领导方法，给工作带来不少好处。秋收的时候，副科长范永明深入到北耽车乡，总结了“建国”农业社谷子、甘薯的丰产经验和良种评选工作的经验，并且及时传播。在这期间，科长桑付有还率领一个巡回检查组下乡，发现秋收粗糙和忽视秋耕现象，及时帮助纠正。现在，大家的工作信心更高了。（郭建中）
