Xinhua News Agency, December 21st, New York Dispatch: Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech at the United Nations on the evening of the 20th.

The Prime Minister said: "The United Nations has grown in eleven years, especially this year, the United Nations has achieved a more important position in world affairs -- I think it is right to say so. Even if the United Nations has not done anything, merely its existence, this remarkable fact, is of great significance to the world."

Nehru reminded the member states of the United Nations that they should handle current international issues in the spirit of "friendship and reconciliation" and should "restrain" their actions so as not to "make the road to reconciliation difficult." He believes that "the first effort should be to avoid worsening the situation and to avoid the situation eventually leading to a major conflict." He said, "We must live in peace with our neighbors. There is no other way to survive."

Nehru criticized the "Cold War" policy. He said that the "Cold War" is better than real war, but it is still "very much against what the United Nations stands for... The Cold War means fueling the idea of war in people's minds. This constantly brings the risk of a hot war breaking out."

Nehru said that all military treaties are "inappropriate" and "cannot increase the strength of any country. They will only make this or that country hostile to you... If we should not have a Cold War, then we should also say that we should not have huge military institutions, treaties and alliances."

Nehru criticized the practice of stationing troops and establishing bases in other countries. He believes that due to the development of weapons, all "bases have become unnecessary and will only cause the other party to take the same action."

The Indian Prime Minister said: "If we can immediately withdraw foreign troops and achieve some degree of disarmament, I think the atmosphere in the world will change completely immediately... Why don't we abolish the system of military alliances and treaties and be frank with each other and try to resolve disputes here in the United Nations, or elsewhere, through debate, instead of using armies, adventures, and the way some countries station armed forces in other countries to protect ourselves? I think we have reached a stage where we should make a choice very soon -- not today, not tomorrow, but the day after tomorrow."

### 尼赫鲁在联合国发表演说  强调用友好和解精神处理国际问题  指出冷战政策非常违反联合国的主张

    尼赫鲁在联合国发表演说
    强调用友好和解精神处理国际问题
    指出冷战政策非常违反联合国的主张
    新华社21日讯　纽约消息：印度总理尼赫鲁20日晚上在联合国发表了演说。
    这位总理说：“联合国在十一年中已经成长了，特别是今年，联合国在世界事务中取得了更重要的地位——我认为这样说是对的。即使联合国没有做任何事情，仅仅是它的存在这个了不起的事实，对于世界也是具有重大意义的。”
    尼赫鲁提醒联合国会员国应当用“友好和和解”的精神来处理当前的国际问题，应当“约制”自己的行动，不要“使和解的道路发生困难”。他认为，“首先要努力争取的是，要避免使形势恶化和避免使形势最终导致一场大冲突。”他说，
  “我们必须同我们的邻居和平相处。没有其他办法可以生存。”
    尼赫鲁对“冷战”政策进行了抨击。他说，“冷战”比真枪实弹的战争是好些，但是它仍然“非常违反联合国所主张的东西的……冷战意味着助长人们心中的战争思想。这样就一直存在着爆发热战的危险。”
    尼赫鲁说，一切军事条约都是“不适当的”，并且“不能增加任何国家的力量。它们只会使这个或是那个国家敌视你们……如果说我们不应有冷战的话，那么就应该说，我们也不应有庞大的军事机构、条约和联盟。”
    尼赫鲁指责了在别的国家内驻扎军队和建立基地的做法。他认为，由于武器的发展，所有的“基地变得不需要了，并且只会引起对方采取同样行动”。
    这位印度总理说：“如果我们能够立刻撤退外国军队而实现某种程度的裁军的话，我认为，世界的气氛将会马上完全改变……为什么我们不废除军事联盟和条约的体系而彼此开诚相见并且通过辩论设法在这里联合国，或是别的地方来解决纠纷，而不是用军队、冒险、某些国家在别的国家驻扎武装部队的办法来保护我们自己呢？我认为，我们已经到了很快——不是在今天、不是明天，而是后天——应当作出选择的阶段了。”
