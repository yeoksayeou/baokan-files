Reducing Costs, Decreasing Expenditures, and Increasing Production
Sihui County Farm Changes its Situation of Continuous Losses

(Our Dispatch) The rice yield of the Sihui County Experimental Farm in Guangdong this year averaged 1,050 jin per mu, with a full-year surplus of 2,412 yuan. This is the first time for the Sihui County Experimental Farm.

Since its establishment in 1953, this farm has consistently operated at a loss due to the mistaken belief by leading cadres that "in order for crops to stand out and serve as a demonstration, no expense should be spared," resulting in very high production costs each year. Taking 1954 as an example, although the average rice yield per mu reached more than 700 jin, exceeding the mu yield of surrounding farmers by more than 100 jin, the total annual rice income (8,690 yuan) was still insufficient to cover the expenses of commercial fertilizers, pesticides, and hired labor, resulting in a loss of 1,600 yuan. Coupled with excessive administrative management expenses, this small farm with only over 120 mu of cultivated land had to be subsidized by the state by more than 5,000 yuan each year for several years.

At the beginning of this year's preparatory work for farming, the farm leaders learned from past lessons, gradually improved business management, established a cost accounting system, and paid attention to economy in production, thereby greatly reducing costs. In the past, they relied entirely on commercial fertilizers, but this year, 80% of the fertilizers used were self-accumulated, which alone reduced expenditures by 3,329 yuan compared to previous years. Moreover, because the farm's paddy fields are sandy soil, the result of applying more pond mud and organic fertilizer was that the soil was improved and the yield was increased.

In terms of administrative management expenses, leading cadres were also able to lead by example this year, overcoming waste. For example, when the late rice cropping season began, the comrade in charge of general affairs planned to buy a bicycle for the farm director, but the farm director said, "It doesn't matter to walk a bit. Let's buy it when the farm's economy improves!" As a result, the money was used to buy several wooden boats to transport fertilizer. This incident influenced the farm's staff, and a good atmosphere of diligence and thrift gradually formed. Previously, farm workers did not cherish public property. If some cattle ropes broke or some manure buckets leaked, they would be discarded. Now, farm workers repair them themselves during their spare time. This year alone, 300 pairs of wooden buckets were repaired. The construction of new granaries and the repair of dormitories and toilets were all done by themselves, without hiring casual labor. This saved a total of 950 yuan. The farm workers also voluntarily reclaimed three mu of wasteland, one mu for growing jute to make ropes, and two mu for growing tobacco leaves to prepare insecticidal powder, which further reduced expenses.

Due to the reduction in production costs and administrative management expenses, coupled with the fact that this year's average rice yield per mu reached 1,050 jin (the first high-yield unit in the county), the year-end settlement result was: the total income from rice, cash crops, and sideline occupations was 15,108 yuan, deducting production costs, administrative management fees, employee wages, and other expenses of 12,155 yuan, there was still a surplus of 2,953 yuan. This not only reversed the loss-making situation of previous years but also enabled the farm to truly play a demonstration role. The surrounding farmers watched the changes in the farm with admiration, and visits and requests to exchange for improved seeds have been coming one after another. The farmers believe that it is not uncommon for each mu of rice paddy to produce 1,000 jin in fertile areas, but this farm is located in a sandy area, and the agricultural production cooperatives in Fengcang Township, which are connected to this farm and have the same natural conditions, only produce just over 700 jin of rice per mu per year, so they all expressed their desire to learn from the farm.

### 降低成本　减少开支　提高产量  四会县农场改变了连年亏本的状况

    降低成本　减少开支　提高产量
    四会县农场改变了连年亏本的状况
    本报讯　广东四会县试验农场今年的水稻产量，平均每亩达到了一千零五十斤，全年盈余两千四百一十二元。这在四会县试验农场说来，还是第一次。
    这个场从1953年开办以来，由于领导干部错误地认为“要使庄稼出人头地，起示范作用，就要不惜工本”，所以历年生产成本很高，总是入不敷出。拿1954年来说，水稻每亩平均产量虽然达到了七百多斤，比周围农民的亩产量多出一百多斤，但全年水稻总收入（八千六百九十元）还不够商品肥料、农药和雇散工的支出，亏本一千六百元。再加上行政管理费用开支过大，几年来，这个只有一百二十多亩耕地的小农场，每年都得国家补贴五千多元。
    今年备耕工作开始，农场领导上吸取了往年的教训，逐步改善经营管理，建立成本核算制，并在生产上注意了节约，因而大大降低了成本。过去全靠商品肥料，今年用的肥料八成是自积的，光这一项就比往年减少支出三千三百二十九元。而且由于这个场的稻田是砂质土，多施塘泥和有机肥料的结果是，改良了土壤，提高了产量。
    在行政管理费的开支方面，领导干部今年还能以身作则，克服浪费。如晚造开耕的时候，做总务工作的同志打算给场长买一辆自行车，场长说：“跑跑路不要紧，等场的经济好转再买吧！”结果将这笔款买了几只木艇回来运肥料。这件事影响了场里的工作人员，勤俭节约的良好风气逐渐形成了。以前场工不爱惜公共财产，牛绳拉断了一些，粪桶有些漏，就丢在一边，现在，场工趁空闲的时间自己修理了。今年一年，就修好木桶三百对。新建谷仓、修理宿舍、厕所都自己动手，不雇散工。以上就一共节约了九百五十元。场工们还自动开垦了三亩荒地，一亩种黄麻制绳，两亩种烟叶配制杀虫粉，这又减少了一笔开支。
    由于生产成本的降低、行政管理费用支出的减少，再加上今年水稻每亩平均产量达到了一千零五十斤（全县第一个千斤丰产单位），所以年终结算的结果是：稻谷和经济作物、副业的总收入共一万五千一百零八元，除去生产成本、行政管理费、职工的工资等支出一万二千一百五十五元，还盈余两千九百五十三元。这不仅扭转了历年来的亏本状况，而且还使农场真正发挥了示范作用。周围的农民以钦佩的眼光注视着这个场的变化，参观访问，要求换良种的接踵而来了。农民们认为，每亩稻田能产一千斤，在肥沃的地区并不稀奇，但是这个场处在砂土地带，和这个场接连、自然条件相同的丰仓乡的农业生产合作社，每亩稻田年产不过七百多斤，所以他们都表示要向农场学习。
