    This newspaper reports: The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is using practical actions to implement the spirit of the "Eighth National Congress" and the resolution on "Opposing Bureaucracy and Upholding the Mass Line" passed by the First Congress of the Shanxi Provincial Party.
    The primary measure taken by the Shanxi Provincial Committee is to organize leading cadres from the Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, and to draw over 300 cadres from prefectural committees and district organs to form five mountain area work inspection teams, which departed on October 21st to conduct inspections in the four districts of Changzhi, Jinan, Yuci, and Jinbei. After the various inspection teams went down, they have launched extensive activities in various places, and have helped local Party grassroots organizations and the masses to discover and solve many practical problems that urgently need to be addressed. The inspection team led by Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, to Changzhi Prefecture, from October 26th to the beginning of November alone, inspected many agricultural cooperatives in Jincheng, Gaoping, and Pingshun counties, and conducted in-depth visits to cooperative members' homes. From the inspections and visits, on the one hand, they learned that the people in the mountainous areas have made many achievements in agriculture, sideline occupations, and capital construction in recent years. On the other hand, there are some serious shortcomings and problems that urgently need to be studied and resolved in the construction work in the mountainous areas. For example, the issue of the proportion of developing agricultural production and developing sideline occupations and other production undertakings, the issue of relief for farmers in areas severely affected by disasters, the issue of developing transportation in mountainous areas, and solving the problems of water shortage and insufficient fuel for some people in mountainous areas, etc. The inspection team gave clear instructions on these issues based on the specific circumstances. For example, regarding the issue of relief for disaster-stricken farmers, the inspection team instructed county and village cadres to earnestly organize disaster-stricken masses to engage in production for self-relief, and to use the relief funds issued by the state to carry out rural capital construction through the method of work-for-relief, or to build roads in mountainous areas. At the same time, specific instructions were also given on how to use the state's relief funds mainly to solve the problem of food rations for disaster victims when organizing work-for-relief. Regarding the issue of multiple villages forming one cooperative and the distribution and consolidation of these cooperatives, the inspection team instructed to conduct specific analysis. Those with little difference in economic conditions (accounting for about 40%) should be resolutely continued. Those with some differences in economic conditions, but after solving some problems, practice has proved that the advantages of multiple villages forming one cooperative outweigh the disadvantages (accounting for about 45%), should also continue to be operated. In those places with large economic differences, many problems, and disputes in distribution where rich villages suffer losses and poor villages benefit, the rich villages should be taken care of to avoid excessive losses, and consolidation should be achieved as much as possible through persuasion and education. In those mountainous areas that are too scattered, unified management is inconvenient, and production is actually carried out by isolated villages and households, the problem of unified distribution is even greater. These places can adopt the method of joint cooperatives, with unified leadership, independent management, and separate calculation of profits and losses.
    The inspection teams to other prefectures have also helped these areas solve many practical problems. For example, the inspection team led by Acting Governor Wei Heng to Yuci Prefecture held discussions with the masses and cadres of Dazhai, Matian, Aiyukou, and Wenbo townships in this prefecture. They focused on studying how this region can implement the policy of comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations, and correct the tendency of slow development of forestry and animal husbandry. Under the guidance of the inspection team, the farmers and cadres in this region have further clarified the importance of comprehensive development of production, and are actively preparing to carry out winter production, increase income, and prepare for next year's production. The inspection team to Jinbei Prefecture, based on the opinions of the masses, assisted the Party branch secretaries, township heads, and agricultural cooperative directors of various townships in studying the current urgent problems to be solved, such as autumn harvest distribution, development of sideline production, lack of fuel, winter clothing, and production and disaster relief. The various groups of the inspection team also listened to many criticisms and opinions raised by the people of the old revolutionary base areas in the mountainous areas to the leading organs. The inspection team to Jinbei Prefecture, after learning that Wutai County had suffered relatively severe disasters this year, immediately suggested that the government allocate 130,000 yuan to help the disaster-stricken people solve their difficulties in production and life.
    Since the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party adopted this measure of going deep into the grassroots, connecting with reality, discovering problems, and solving them on the spot, it has achieved good results. Not only has it promptly discovered and helped solve urgent problems at the grassroots level, but it has also greatly strengthened the ties between the Party and the people, which is conducive to overcoming bureaucracy in leadership work. The Provincial Committee will earnestly summarize the experience of this inspection and visit.

### 中共山西省委和省人民委员会组织视察团　深入下层　发现问题　就地解决

    中共山西省委和省人民委员会组织视察团
　　深入下层　发现问题　就地解决
    本报讯　中共山西省委正用实际行动来贯彻“八大”精神，和山西省党的第一次代表大会所通过的关于“反对官僚主义坚持群众路线”的决议。
    山西省委采取的首要措施是，组织省委和省人民委员会的领导干部，抽调地委和专区机关的干部共三百多人，组成五个山区工作视察团，在10月21日分赴长治、晋南、榆次、晋北等四个专区进行视察。各个视察团下去以后，已分别在各地展开了广泛的活动，并且已经帮助当地党的基层组织和群众，发现或解决了不少急待解决的实际问题。由中共山西省委第一书记陶鲁笳带领去长治专区的视察团，仅从10月26日到11月初旬，就在晋城、高平和平顺等县，视察了许多农业社，并深入到社员家里进行了访问。从视察访问中，一方面了解到几年来山区人民在农业、副业和基本建设等方面，都取得了很多成绩，但另一方面在山区建设工作上，也有一些严重缺点和急待研究解决的问题。比如发展农业生产和发展副业以及其他生产事业的比例问题，对于遭受严重灾害地区农民的救济问题，发展山区交通事业和解决一部分山区人民缺乏水源和燃料不足的问题等等，对于这些问题，视察团都根据具体情况，做了明确的指示。例如，对于受灾农民的救济问题，视察团指示各县和乡村干部，要认真组织受灾群众的生产自救，把国家发下的救济款，通过以工代赈的办法来进行农村的基本建设，或修筑山区的道路。同时，对组织以工代赈时，如何把国家的救济款主要用于解决灾民口粮问题，也作了具体指示。对于多村一社和这些社的分配、巩固问题，视察团指示要做具体分析。那些经济条件差异不大的（这类约占40％），要坚决办下去。经济条件虽有差异，但在解决一些问题之后，实践证明多村一社利大弊少者（这类约占45％），也要继续办下去。那些经济差异很大、问题很多、分配中发生了富村吃亏穷村沾光的纠纷的地方，应当照顾富村，使其不太吃亏，并尽量通过说服教育使其巩固。那些山区中过于分散统一经营不便，实际是孤庄独户进行生产的社，统一分配问题更大。这些地方可以采取联合社的办法，统一领导，各自经营，各自计算盈亏。
    到其它专区的视察团，也帮助这些地区解决了不少实际的问题。如由卫恒代省长带领去榆次专区的视察团，曾和这个专区的大寨、麻田、隘峪口和温泊等乡的群众、干部举行了座谈。着重研究了这个地区如何贯彻执行农、林、牧、副全面发展的方针，纠正林业和牧畜业发展缓慢的偏向。经过视察团的指导，这个地区的农民和干部进一步明确了全面发展生产的重要性，正积极着手准备开展冬季生产，增加收入，和为明年生产作好准备。到晋北区的视察团，曾根据群众意见，分别协助各乡党支部书记、乡长、农业社长研究了当前迫切需要解决的秋收分配、发展副业生产、缺乏燃料、寒衣和生产救灾等问题。视察团的各小组还分别听取了山区老革命根据地人民对领导机关提出的许多批评和意见。去晋北专区的视察团，在了解到五台县今年受灾比较严重后，即建议政府拨款十三万元，帮助受灾群众解决生产和生活上的困难。
    中共山西省委采取这种深入下层、联系实际、发现问题、就地解决的措施以后，已经收到了良好的效果。不但及时发现和帮助下面解决了急需解决的问题，而且大大地密切了党同人民群众的联系，有助于克服领导工作中的官僚主义。省委将认真总结这次视察访问的经验。
