   Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture

   New Coffee Enters the Market
    (Our report) New coffee from the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province has entered the market, and the Provincial Purchasing Bureau and National Trade Company are currently purchasing it. The coffee plants here generally grew well this year, with an average yield of one "jin" of dry beans per plant, and an estimated harvest of about one hundred "dan." This year, the purchasing method has changed from the previous mixed collection to grading and pricing based on quality, a method welcomed by farmers.
    Coffee has been planted in Dehong for more than twenty years. The small-bean coffee of Dehong, even without proper cultivation in the past, could yield about one "jin" per plant; well-cultivated plants could yield as much as five or six "jin." The four-year-old saplings cultivated after liberation have already reached an average yield of one "jin" this year; the best plant produced 7,949 fruits, and after deducting 5% for losses, it is estimated that 6.7 "jin" of dry beans can be harvested.
    Dehong's coffee is not only high in yield, but also rich in aroma and pure in taste. From February to September this year, it was transported and sold to Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, and other places, and was quite popular. (Zhang Jiechun)

　　德宏傣族景颇族自治州
　　新咖啡上市
    本报讯　云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州新咖啡已经上市，省采购局和民族贸易公司正在收购。今年这里的咖啡一般生长得不错，平均每株可采干豆一斤，估计可收一百担左右。今年在收购中改变了过去混合收的办法，分等按质论价，这个办法受到农民的欢迎。
    德宏种植咖啡有二十多年历史，德宏的小粒咖啡，以前没有好好培植，每株也能产一斤左右；培植得好的，可产五、六斤之多。解放后培植的四年生幼树，今年平均产量已可达到一斤；最好的一株结了七千九百四十九个果，除去5％的损失，估计可收干豆六点七斤。
    德宏的咖啡不只产量高，而且香气浓、味道淳，今年2月至9月间曾运销到广州、上海、北京等地，颇受欢迎。　（章皆淳）
