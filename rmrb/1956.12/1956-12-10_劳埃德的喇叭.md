　　Lloyd's Trumpet

　　When British Foreign Secretary Lloyd announced in the House of Commons that Britain and France had agreed to withdraw their troops from Port Said, he described Britain and France being forced to withdraw from Egypt as a "victory" for their invasion of Egypt. Lloyd insisted that the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt "prevented a local war... promoted action by the United Nations... and saved the world from disaster..." This kind of bragging, like hitting oneself in the face to look imposing, immediately drew bursts of laughter from the members of parliament. At the time, Labour MP Bevan sharply pointed out that Lloyd was "blowing a trumpet in advance to cover up his retreat"!

　　Two days later, the British House of Commons held a debate on the invasion of Egypt policy. Bevan again sharply ridiculed Lloyd. For example, if Lloyd's claim that the Conservative government's aggression was a contribution to the United Nations and humanity were valid, then Hitler and Mussolini "could also claim that they started a war against the whole world to allow the United Nations to be established"; "If bacteria could talk, they could say that the primary reason for their existence is for the progress of medicine."

　　Lloyd's sophistry is actually not new. Throughout history, aggressors have tried everything possible to decorate their bloody hands and cover up their failures. When they run out of ideas, they even deceive themselves, treating others as fools.

　　From this, people can't help but recall Hans Christian Andersen's story about an emperor who "wore" a "magic robe" that supposedly only fools couldn't see. This self-proclaimed clever emperor, in order to prove that he was not a fool, insisted on parading naked in the streets, even though he knew he was stark naked. Obviously, Lloyd also wanted to use his "trumpet" to make people believe that the British and French governments were not aggressors and losers, but the result only exposed their ugliness and shamelessness. This not only made British parliamentarians laugh, made the people of the world feel disgusted, but even made some people within his own Conservative Party feel ashamed! The Conservative's "Daily Telegraph" complained: "The Cabinet's arguments on the Suez issue have been rambling, chaotic and hesitant," and no cabinet member has the "mind and ability" to justify themselves. This is indeed the case. (Ping)

　　劳埃德的喇叭
    英国外交大臣劳埃德在下院宣布英法同意从塞得港撤兵的时候，把英法被迫从埃及撤兵，说成是它们进攻埃及取得了“胜利”。劳埃德硬说，英法侵略埃及的行动，“已制止了一场局部战争……促成联合国采取行动……使得全世界避免了灾难……。”他这种打肿了脸硬充胖子的吹嘘，当场引起了议员们一阵又一阵的哄堂大笑。当时，工党议员比万就曾辛辣地指出，劳埃德是“在事先先吹一通喇叭来掩饰他的退却”！
    两天之后，英国下议院举行侵略埃及政策的辩论。比万又尖锐地嘲笑了劳埃德。比方说，如果劳埃德把保守党政府的侵略行为说成是对联合国和对人类的功劳的话能够成立，那么，希特勒和墨索里尼也“可能会声称他们向全世界开战是为了让联合国成立”；“如果细菌能够交谈的话，它们就能够说，它们的存在的首要理由是为了医学的进展”。
    劳埃德的诡辩其实也不新鲜，历史上的侵略者总是想尽一切办法来装璜自己的血手和掩饰自己的失败的。他们在计穷力竭的时候，甚至不惜自己欺骗自己，把别人都当做傻子。
    从这里，人们不禁记起了安徒生讲过的关于一个“穿”上了据说只有傻子才看不见的“神衣”的故事。这个自以为聪明的皇帝，为了证明自己不是傻子，明知自己一丝不挂，却硬要光着屁股上街游行。显然，劳埃德也想用他的“喇叭”来使人相信英法政府不是侵略者和失败者，但结果恰恰暴露了它们的丑恶和无耻。这不但使英国议员感到可笑，使世界人民感到恶心，甚至使他自己的保守党内也有人感到丢脸！保守党的“每日电讯报”就抱怨说：“内阁在苏伊士问题上提出的论点一直是东扯西拉、杂乱无章和支支吾吾的”，没有一个阁员有能够自圆其说的“头脑和能力”。这是的的确确的。　（平）
