    Does Opera Work Not Need New Literary and Art Workers?
    Tian Yin
    In the past thirty years, the development of Chinese opera has experienced a tortuous path: from complete negation or complete affirmation to critical acceptance, from reforming old dramas to utilizing old forms to "promoting the old to bring forth the new." The attitude of new literary and art workers towards opera has also changed from ignoring it to participating in its reform. Before liberation, only a few new literary and art workers befriended opera performers. After liberation, a large number of new literary and art workers participated in opera work, living and working with the performers. Isn't this a significant change in opera work?
    There are many examples of how a certain opera genre or troupe has taken on a new look due to the assistance of new literary and art workers. For example, the Yue opera in Shanghai, the Ping opera in North China, the Ju opera in Shandong, as well as many folk operas such as Huangmei opera and Xi opera, have all seen significant improvements and development in recent years and have been welcomed by the masses. In particular, Yue opera opened up such a new path as early as the Anti-Japanese War, and as a result, the influence of Yue opera is very extensive. After the first National Opera Performance, this change became even more obvious.
    Recently, there have been crude phenomena in opera work, especially in the reform of artistic forms, which have violated the inherent laws of opera development. It is necessary to criticize and correct these deviations. However, correcting deviations is not the same as completely denying the necessity of new literary and art workers participating in opera work and their role. If one concludes from this that opera work does not need the participation of new literary and art workers at all, I think it will lead to another deviation.
    It must be admitted that some new literary and art workers do not have a clear understanding of the characteristics of opera, do not attach enough importance to it, have a crude style in sorting out and reforming opera art, and their unity and cooperation with the performers are not close enough. However, this is largely a phenomenon that occurs in the process of going from unfamiliarity to familiarity. In addition to subjective factors, there are also many objective reasons. Currently, there is a kind of accusation that the achievements of opera work belong to the performers, and the shortcomings and mistakes all belong to the new literary and art workers, which is difficult to convince. In fact, some performers do not think so. They say: "New literary and art workers are like one of our legs. Without them, it is difficult for us to walk." They also said: "We deeply realize that since liberation, the reason why performers have made progress in all aspects and have achieved success in their work is inseparable from the help of new literary and art workers."
    The so-called new literary and art workers are some playwrights, composers, directors, and administrative leaders. Due to differences in life experiences, habits, and different views and practices in dealing with national heritage, there are indeed differences in steps in the work between these people and the performers. However, it is entirely possible to achieve mutual learning, promote mutual unity and progress through long-term artistic practice, summing up the experience of success or failure, and drawing lessons.
    We have an excellent tradition: Guan Hanqing and Li Yu were not only playwrights but also drama critics. Performing artists Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, etc., united some playwrights or drama critics such as Qi Rushan and Luo Yinggong, etc., and often studied scripts together and discussed performing arts. We need to inherit these successful experiences.
    An important issue in opera work is that, in addition to actors, there is a lack of playwrights, directors, and musicians in the opera circle. If opera only has one leg to move forward, it will not be stable. Many performers deeply feel this and often ask the government to send business cadres to help them, but how many cadres are very familiar with opera work? Only working and learning at the same time, it is inevitable to make mistakes. How to correct it? One way is to point fingers and scold, the other is not to allow criticism, but also to withdraw people and never engage in opera again. I think both attitudes are wrong.
    Constantly improving the cultural level of the performers and enriching their new knowledge, and constantly reminding new literary and art workers to learn from traditional art, especially to be familiar with and deeply understand the performing skills of the performers, the two aspects will be connected, and the contradictions will be unified. In recent years, this new change has begun to take place. The title of "old artist" no longer exists. New literary and art workers participate in opera work, delve into it, and the boundaries with opera performers will gradually disappear. Everyone's goal is the same: to work together from different work angles for the development of opera.

    戏曲工作不需要新文艺工作者吗？
    田因
    近三十年来，中国戏曲的发展，经历着一条曲折的道路：由全盘否定或全部肯定到批判的接受，由改良旧剧到利用旧形式到“推陈出新”；而新文艺工作者对戏曲的态度，也由不看不理到参加改革。解放前，还只有少数的新文艺工作者和戏曲艺人交朋友。解放后，大批的新文艺工作者参加了戏曲工作，和艺人在一起共同生活，共同工作。这不是戏曲工作的一个重大变化吗？
    由于戏曲艺人取得了新文艺工作者的协助，使得某一剧种或某一剧团呈现出新的姿态的，有许多例子。如上海的越剧，北方的评剧，山东的莒剧以及黄梅戏、锡剧等许多民间小戏，近年来都有极显著的提高和发展，受到了群众的欢迎。特别是越剧，早在抗日战争时期，就开辟了这样一条新道路，因而越剧的影响，十分广泛。在第一次全国戏曲会演以后，这个变化更是十分明显。
    近来，戏曲工作中，特别是对艺术形式的改革，有粗暴现象，违反了戏曲本身的发展规律。批评纠正这些偏差，是必要的。但纠正偏差，不等于完全否定新文艺工作者参加戏曲工作的必要性和他们的作用。如果就此得出结论，说戏曲工作根本无需新文艺工作者参与其事，我以为又会导致另一种偏向。
    不必讳言，确有些新文艺工作者，对戏曲的特点认识不清，重视不够，对待戏曲艺术的整理和改革，有粗暴作风，和艺人们的团结合作也还不够密切。但这在很大程度上，是由不熟不懂到熟悉起来的过程中所发生的现象，其中除了主观因素外，也有不少客观原因。目前却有种责难，说戏曲工作的成绩是艺人的，缺点和错误全是新文艺工作者的，这就难以令人信服。其实，有些艺人并不这样想，他们说：“新文艺工作者，好比是我们的一只腿，没有他们我们是不好走路的。”又说：“我们深刻体会到，解放以来，艺人所以在各方面有所提高，工作有成绩，是和新文艺工作者的帮助分不开的。”
    所谓新文艺工作者，就是一些编剧的、谱曲的、导演的，还有做行政领导工作的。这些人和艺人之间，由于生活经历、习惯作风的不同，还有在对待民族遗产的态度上存在着不同的看法和做法，因而在工作中步调不一，那是事实；但经过长期的艺术实践，总结成功或失败的经验，取得教训，互相学习，促进彼此的团结和进步，也是完全可能的。
    我们有一个优良传统：关汉卿、李笠翁不仅是剧作家，也是演剧评论家；表演艺术家梅兰芳、程砚秋等都团结一些编剧者或剧评家如齐如山、罗瘿公等，经常在一块研究剧本，探讨表演艺术。这些成功的经验，我们是需要继承的。
    戏曲工作中的一个重要问题，是戏曲界除了演员之外，编剧、导演、音乐工作者等都很缺乏。戏曲只剩下一只腿迈步，前进就不会稳健。很多艺人们是深有此感的，经常提出要政府派业务干部帮助他们，但是有多少非常熟悉戏曲工作的干部呢？只有一面工作，一面学习，这样就难免不犯错误。怎样纠正呢？一种是指着鼻子横加斥责，一种是不准批评，还要把人抽回去，再也不搞戏曲，我觉得这两种态度都是不对的。
    不断地提高艺人的文化水平和丰富艺人的新的知识，不断地提醒新文艺工作者向传统艺术学习，特别是熟知深懂艺人的表演技术，两方面就会沟通起来，矛盾也会统一起来。几年来，已经开始有这种新的变化。“旧艺人”的称号不存在了，新文艺工作者参加了戏曲工作，钻研进去，和戏曲艺人的界限也会逐渐消失。大家的目标是一个：从不同的工作角度，共同为戏曲的发展而努力。
