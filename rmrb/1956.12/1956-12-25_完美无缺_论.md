    On "Perfect and Flawless" Theory
    Feng Bairu
    In academic work, there is often a phenomenon where if someone is said to be good or something is considered decent, it is praised to the heavens; conversely, it is cast into the depths of hell. It's either good or bad, as if something that is both good and bad has never existed.
    I remember that during the May Fourth Movement when the Confucian shop was overthrown, the ancient heritage was completely negated. However, now that we are organizing our cultural heritage, classical literature has been added to the high school curriculum. As a result, as long as literature is labeled "ancient," there is nothing bad in it.
    The establishment of socialist and communist culture must be built on the basis of sorting out and promoting our cultural heritage; this is undoubtedly correct. Without the past, there will be no present or future. Our new culture cannot be built out of thin air. However, we must resolutely oppose the "praise to the sky" and "suppress to the ground" approach. The past attitude of completely obliterating ancient literature was certainly wrong, but now, because we want to read classical literature, not only classical literature but even the ancients have no shortcomings. This is also an absolutely ahistorical point of view; and this ahistorical point of view is now indeed having a great run of luck.
    I have heard many lectures by famous people and read many great works introducing classical literature. As a high school literature teacher, I have also read teaching reference materials from higher authorities, and they are almost all the same: only talking about the good, not the bad. Confucius, Mencius... all must emphasize their "democratic ideas," while their backward aspects that helped consolidate feudal rule are either only slightly mentioned or simply not discussed. Why do this? Do we want the students who are born in the socialist era to worship and imitate the ancients?
    If this issue is not resolved, it will be a major setback for our students' ideological understanding. In fact, high school literature teachers across the country are now teaching based on the "Senior High School Textbook Literature Teaching Reference Book" published in Beijing. I think the "Senior High School Textbook Literature Teaching Reference Book" is compiled according to the spirit of "everything ancient is perfect and flawless."
    For example, in the "Zuo Zhuan's" lesson "Duke Wen of Jin, Chong'er's Exile," the teaching reference book clearly instructs teachers as follows: "... This attitude of daring to eliminate emotional impulses shows the political training Chong'er received during his long and arduous exile, strengthening his ability to distinguish right from wrong." In the annotations of the literature textbook, the editors pointed out even more clearly: "This excerpt is taken from 'Zuo Zhuan,' and the entire piece describes Chong'er's experiences and training during his exile..." But what exactly is the so-called "training"? The reference book tells us that Chong'er can endure hardship. However, in my opinion, this endurance shows in many places Chong'er's hypocrisy and coping methods in order to return to his country and become a monarch. For example, when Chong'er passed through the state of Wei, he begged for food from a peasant, and when the peasant gave him a clod of earth, he angrily wanted to whip him; later, because Zifan said, "It is a gift from heaven," he bowed his head to accept it and carried it. Can it be said that Chong'er had no feelings about this matter in his heart? Also, when Chong'er arrived in the state of Qin, Duke Mu of Qin sent him five women, including Huai Ying. After Huai Ying poured water for him to wash his hands, he waved her away; it was not until Huai Ying was furious that he became afraid and compared himself to a prisoner. This attitude of being arrogant before and respectful afterward clearly shows the ugliness of his ruling class character. Can it also be said that this was his political training? If learning a set of hypocrisy in order to become a monarch is called political training, is it asking our students to learn his kind of "political training"?
    The problem is very clear, it is not that Zuo Qiuming wrote the article badly. Zuo Zhuan in portraying characters makes us feel as if we see the person being described. In the work "Chong'er's Exile," there are many places that focus on portraying Chong'er's ruling class character, which is also a successful aspect of the work; unfortunately, under the control of the "perfect and flawless" view, our comrades who compiled the reference book have forgotten this.
    Of course, we cannot say that Chong'er did not receive any political training during his exile, but Chong'er's political training is not here. After more than ten years of exile, Chong'er realized that to be able to be a monarch, he must obtain the support and support of the people, and he must also be able to trust his subordinates and unite with his subordinates sincerely. Therefore, he once chased Zifan away with a spear when leaving the state of Qi, and when he returned to Jin with the help of Duke Mu of Qin, Zifan asked to leave him, and he threw a jade ring to make an oath. These places can clearly show the difference between before and after. The reference book's analysis is not in-depth and is vague, which is very clear, and I think the "perfect and flawless" view is at play.
    This kind of "perfect and flawless" theory, in my opinion, is universally present in our classical literature researchers and teachers, and its root lies in the ahistorical treatment of our cultural heritage and ancient figures, and it is also related to the literary habits of "praising to the sky and suppressing to the ground." If this continues to develop, especially for our young students, its impact will be very bad and very large. I think this issue needs to be carefully considered by classical literature researchers and teachers.

    “完美无缺”论
    冯白鲁
    在学术工作里经常有这样一种现象，说某一个人好或某一样东西不错，就捧它上三十三天；反之，那就要把它打入十八层地狱。不是好，便是坏，仿佛既好又坏的东西是从来也不曾有过似的。
    记得在“五四”打倒孔家店的时候，就全盘否定古代的遗产，可是，现在要整理我国的文化遗产了，高中的课程里又列上古典文学一项，于是，只要文学占上一个“古”字，里面就没有一点儿坏东西。
    社会主义、共产主义文化的建立，必须建筑在对我国文化遗产的整理与发扬的基础上；这一点自然是丝毫不错的。没有过去，就不会有现在，也不会有将来。我们的新文化不是可以凭空建立起来的。但是，那种“扬之登天”“抑之入地”的办法，我们必须坚决反对。过去那种对古代文学一律抹杀的态度自然是不对的，不过，现在因为要读古典文学，因此不但古典文学，连古人也都一点儿缺点也没有。这也是绝对的非历史的观点；而这种非历史的观点，现在却确确实实是大走其鸿运。
    我听过不少次名人的演讲。也看过不少介绍古典文学的大著。作为一个高中文学教师的我，还读到来自上级的教学参考资料，几乎都是一个样子：只说好的、不讲坏的。孔子、孟子……都得着重介绍其“民主思想”，而对其落后的有助于巩固封建统治的一面，或者仅是稍稍提到，或者简直不谈。为什么要这样做呢？难道要我们生在社会主义时代的莘莘学子都去崇奉古人、模仿古人不成么？
    如果这一个问题不解决，对于我们学生的思想认识来说，那就非大开倒车不可。事实上，现在全国的高中文学教师，都是根据北京出版的“高级中学课本文学教学参考书”在进行教学的。我觉得“高级中学课本文学教学参考书”，就是根据“凡古的即完美无缺”的精神编撰的。
    举个例来说吧，“左传”的“晋公子重耳出亡”一课，教学参考书是明明白白地这样对教师进行指导的：“……这种勇于消除意气的态度，显示重耳在艰苦的长期流亡里所受到的政治锻炼，加强了他明辨事理的能力。”在文学课本的注释里，编者指得更明彻：“这篇是从‘左传’里节选的，全篇描述重耳在流亡途中的经历和所受的锻炼，……”但所谓“锻炼”究竟是什么呢？参考书告诉我们的是重耳能够忍耐。可是这种忍耐，以我看很多地方是表现了重耳为了回国做国君所采取的虚伪、应付的手段。譬如说重耳过卫时乞食于野人，因为野人与之块，他就怒欲鞭之；后来因为子犯说：“天赐也”。他这才稽首受而载之。难道说重耳对这件事是心中竟无所感的么？又如重耳至秦国时，秦伯送五个女子给他，内中还有怀嬴，怀嬴奉匜沃盥以后他就挥而赶之；直到怀嬴大怒，他才又惧而自比囚犯。这种前倨后恭的态度，是很可以看出他那种统治阶级的丑恶的。难道也可以说是他所受的政治锻炼么？如果说为了做国君而学会了一套虚伪叫作政治锻炼，是不是叫我们的同学也去学他那种“政治锻炼”呢？
    问题很清楚，这不是左丘明把文章写坏了。左传在刻划人物上，描写一个什么样的人就仿佛使我们看到那个人一样。重耳出亡这一篇作品里，就有很多地方是着重地刻划了重耳这个人物的统治阶级性格的，也正是作品成功的一面；可惜的是，在“完美无缺”的观点支配下，我们编参考书的同志竟因此而忘怀了。
    自然，我们不能说重耳没有在流亡过程中受到过政治锻炼，可是重耳所受的政治锻炼却不在这里。重耳经过十多年的流亡生活，他认识到了要能够做国君必须得到人民的支持与拥护，也必须能够相信部下，与部下精诚团结，所以他曾经在离开齐国时以戈逐子犯，到了得秦穆公之助返晋时，子犯向他求去，他就投璧盟誓，这些地方都可以清楚地看出其前后的不同的。参考书分析得不够深入、模糊，是很清楚的，而所以会这样，我想是“完美无缺”的观点在作祟吧。
    这种“完美无缺”论，据我看，是普遍地存在于我们古典文学研究者与教学者的身上、而其根源则是非历史主义的对待我国文化遗产和古代人物，也是和那种“扬之登天，抑之入地”的文人积习有关联的，如果再这样继续与发展下去，特别对我们青年学生来说，其影响是很坏也很大的，我觉得这个问题有引起古典文学研究者和教学者慎重考虑的必要。
