Overcoming the Tendency to Emphasize Quantity and Neglect Quality in Higher Education
　　Zhang Jian
    The resolution on the political report of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out, "China's higher education has developed rapidly in the past few years, but there has also been a tendency to emphasize quantity and neglect quality. In the future, we should continue to increase the number of students as much as possible while ensuring a certain quality." This not only summarizes the higher education work of the past few years in general but also points out a clear direction for the higher education work in the future.
    Why has the tendency to emphasize quantity and neglect quality emerged in higher education in the past few years? In studying the documents of the "Eighth National Congress," I feel that there are several reasons for this.
    First, there was insufficient investigation and research into the needs of national construction and the possible conditions of schools, which led to the mistake of subjectivism.
    The backwardness of modern industry, scientific research, and education in old China resulted in a small number of scientific and technological cadres with poor quality. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, due to the rapid recovery and development of the national economy, a large number of scientific and technological cadres have been needed. Therefore, starting in 1952, there was a demand to vigorously develop higher education, especially higher industrial education. Various departments first put forward quantitative requirements for scientific and technological cadres, and the number of these requirements was often high and large. The number of needs submitted to the higher education graduates distribution departments each year was always excessive, while the actual number of graduates each year was very small. Our estimates of the subjective conditions of higher education institutions also had certain one-sidedness. Due to the lagging development of senior high schools compared to the requirements of higher education development, there was little room for selection when enrolling new students each year, making it difficult to improve the quality of new students. Because the number of teachers needed each year could not be fully supplemented, and the quality varied, it was difficult to meet the requirements of improving teaching quality and carrying out scientific research. Although nearly 10,000 teaching assistants have been added in recent years, they still cannot fully meet the requirements of teaching and scientific research. Many excellent teachers waste time on preparing experiments and sorting out general materials. The design and construction of higher education infrastructure were not easily completed on schedule, and the construction of school buildings and the replenishment of teaching equipment often could not keep up with the needs of school development. Higher education teaching work focuses on meeting the general production and quantitative requirements of factories and mines. It does not pay enough attention to the quality of scientific and technological cadres needed by factories and mines, and even less attention to cultivating high-quality higher education teachers and scientific research personnel. It is precisely because we have failed to combine the needs of national construction with the possible conditions of schools that we have inevitably produced the tendency to emphasize quantity and neglect quality.
    Secondly, in the process of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to carry out teaching reform in China's higher education, although the achievements have been great, there are also more or less the following shortcomings: Insufficient consideration has been given to the actual needs of China's socialist construction, the uneven development of various higher education institutions, and the actual level of teachers and students in various schools. Therefore, the uniformity of teaching plans and teaching syllabuses has been overemphasized, and flexibility has been neglected. Less attention has been paid to summarizing and absorbing the cultural heritage of the Chinese nation, and some useful things in the old Chinese higher education have also been easily negated. At the same time, the advanced experience of the Soviet Union itself has not been systematically studied. In learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, the useful things of the Eastern European people's democratic countries and the European and American capitalist countries have been neglected. For example, in some European and American capitalist countries, in order to train scientific and technological cadres with high scientific and technological levels, science and engineering departments can be combined to establish polytechnic colleges; in some countries, higher education institutions have coarser divisions of majors, a deeper foundation of scientific knowledge, and less professional knowledge, because they can still study on their own when they come to work posts; required courses are appropriately reduced, and elective courses are appropriately increased to meet the different learning requirements of each student. These areas are still worth our study and reference. At the same time, when schools conduct collectivism education and discipline education for students, they overemphasize collective unity and organizational discipline, while neglecting the principle of "ensuring the free development of the personality of the broad masses of people in their common life"; when conducting the education of "good health, good study, and good work," they one-sidedly emphasize that good health means passing the labor and defense system exercise, good study means getting five points in every subject, and good work means participating in excessive social activities. Precisely because of the dogmatic mistakes and neglect of the free development of students' personalities in common life, the current schools more or less have the problems of excessive learning burden and mechanically rigid restrictions on life, which hinders the cultivation of students' independent thinking and independent work ability. Although these problems are being corrected, we should learn from them.
    From this, it can be seen that there are two fundamental problems in China's current higher education: one is the contradiction between excessive objective needs and limited subjective conditions, which consequently leads to the tendency to emphasize quantity and neglect quality; the other is the dogmatic mistake in the teaching reform process of higher education institutions, that is, the neglect of cultivating students' independent thinking and independent work ability. Other problems arise from this.
    If the above two fundamental problems are not solved in time, it will inevitably have quite serious consequences for China's socialist construction and the development of higher education institutions themselves. We can see the importance of improving the quality of cadre training from the following aspects.
    Due to the decline in the quality of scientific and technological cadres, it hinders us from building a basically complete industrial system during the three five-year plans or a little more time. To build a basically complete industrial system, the requirements for the training of scientific and technological cadres are not only large in quantity but also good in quality. The so-called good quality means that higher education institutions can cultivate advanced construction talents who have a Marxist-Leninist theoretical foundation, master the latest achievements in modern world science and technology, are in good health, are loyal to the socialist construction cause of the motherland, and have comprehensive personality development. They can not only adapt to the requirements of production in China's newly built factories and mines, but also be competent for teaching and research work in higher education institutions and scientific research institutions. The excellent ones can also be trained to become advanced scientific experts who have reached the world's advanced level. Of course, we are not saying that all schools, majors, and every graduate must meet the same requirements, but the scientific and technological cadres we train should gradually improve on the original basis with the rapid progress of China's socialist construction and world science and technology, and should never stagnate or gradually decline.
    Due to the decline in the quality of scientific and technological cadres, it will inevitably hinder us from striving to approach or catch up with the world's advanced level in urgently needed scientific departments by the end of the third five-year plan. To approach or catch up with the world's advanced level in urgently needed scientific departments in a short period of twelve years, the decisive link is to train complete sets of scientific and technological cadres, especially high-level experts at the level of associate doctors and doctors, for these scientific departments, otherwise, approaching or catching up with the world's advanced level is empty talk.
    Reducing the quality of cadre training will have a very bad impact on the entire education, especially on higher education itself. Due to the low quality of cadres trained by higher education institutions, they cannot be used as one person for one person, which will inevitably force various business departments to require quantity to replace quality. If one person is not used for one person, they will require two or three people to be used for one person. As a result, higher education institutions will be forced to take on more and more tasks, and will become more and more shoddy. The more shoddy they become, the lower the quality of cadres will be. The lower the quality, the more quantity will be required. The more quantity, the lower the quality will become, and the more serious the cycle will become. And the greater the development of higher education, the more it will force senior high schools to accelerate their development, and the great development of senior high schools will force junior high schools to accelerate their development. Due to the failure of the supply of teachers and funds for general education, it will cause adverse consequences for general education.
    How to overcome the tendency to emphasize quantity and neglect quality, and vigorously implement the policy of "continuing to increase the number of students as much as possible while ensuring a certain quality" as indicated in the resolution on the political report of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China? According to my personal opinion, we should start from the following aspects:
    Conscientiously find out the actual needs of national construction for the quantity and quality of scientific and technological cadres and the subjective possible conditions of higher education institutions. In the future, we should conduct comprehensive planning for the training of scientific and technological cadres, and we must not only vigorously overcome the tendency to emphasize quantity and neglect quality, but also pay attention to preventing the one-sided emphasis on quality and neglect of quantitative needs. We must guarantee the basic construction, teaching equipment, teacher supplementation, staffing, and funding necessary for higher education institutions to achieve their enrollment plans. Without these basic material conditions, it is impossible to improve the quality of cadre training. On the one hand, we must oppose some wasteful phenomena in higher education institutions in the past and vigorously implement the policy of streamlining and saving; on the other hand, the manpower, material resources, and financial resources necessary for teaching and scientific research must also be guaranteed. Through investigation and research, we should verify the actual needs of various business departments and the subjective conditions of higher education institutions, and formulate plans for cadre training in 1957 and during the second and third five-year plans according to the principle that objective needs and subjective conditions are adapted to each other. We must determine the caliber of various majors and determine a reasonable ratio of senior and junior talents. We must strengthen the work of cultivating scientific and technological cadres through spare-time education, and ensure that regular schools can cultivate scientific and technological cadres with better quality.
    We should systematically summarize the experience of higher education reform and development since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and pay special attention to overcoming the dogmatism in teaching work and the mistake of neglecting students' free development of their personalities in common life. To this end, in addition to systematically summarizing the construction experience of China's higher education since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we must also systematically study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, and critically absorb some useful things from European and American capitalist countries. We must study and solve the problem of establishing a new type of higher education that serves China's socialist construction.
    Party organizations at all levels should strengthen their leadership over higher education, correctly implement the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals and the policy of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend and a hundred flowers bloom," and fully exert the enthusiasm and creativity of teachers, students, and staff to improve the quality of higher education in all aspects.

    克服高等教育中强调数量忽视质量的倾向
    张健
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会关于政治报告的决议中指出，“我国高等教育在过去几年中有了迅速的发展，但是也发生了强调数量、忽视质量的倾向。今后，应当在保证一定质量的条件下，尽可能地继续增加学生的数量。”这里不但概括地总结了过去的高等教育工作，而且也对今后的高等教育工作指出了明确的方向。
    过去几年来高等教育为什么会产生强调数量忽视质量的倾向？我在学习“八大”文件中，感到有这几方面的原因。
    首先，对国家建设的需要和学校可能的条件调查研究不够，犯了主观主义的毛病。
    旧中国的近代工业和科学研究与教育事业的落后，培养的科学技术干部数量既少，质量又差。建国以来，由于国民经济的迅速恢复和发展，需要大量的科学技术干部。因此，就从1952年开始，要求大力发展高等教育特别是要大力发展高等工业教育。各部门对于科学技术干部首先是提出数量上的要求，而且这种要求的数量往往都是偏高偏大，每年向高等学校毕业生分配部门提出的需要数总是过多，而每年实际毕业生人数却很少。我们对高等学校主观条件的估计也有某些片面性。由于高级中学发展落后于高等学校发展的要求，因而每年招收新生缺少选择的余地，难于提高新生质量。由于每年所需要的师资不能如数地得到补充，质量又是好坏参差不齐，这就难于适应提高教学质量和开展科学研究的要求。教学辅助人员近几年来虽然补充近万人，但还不能完全适应教学和科学研究的要求，许多优秀教师将时间浪费在准备实验和整理一般资料等事务工作中去。高等学校基本建设当年设计施工不易如期完成，校舍修建和教学设备的补充常赶不上学校发展的需要。高等学校教学工作偏重于满足厂矿企业一般生产上、数量上的要求，对于厂矿企业所需要的科学技术干部的质量固然照顾得不够，对于培养质量较好的高等学校师资和科学研究人员注意得更差，正由于未能将国家的建设需要和学校可能的条件很好的结合起来，因而就难免产生强调数量、忽视质量的倾向。
    其次，在学习苏联先进经验来进行我国高等教育的教学改革过程中，虽然成绩是很大的，但也或多或少地存在着以下的缺点：对于我国社会主义建设的实际需要、各高等学校发展的不平衡性以及各校师生水平等实际情况照顾的不够，因此，就过分地强调教学计划和教学大纲的统一性而忽视了灵活性。对总结和吸收中华民族文化遗产注意较差，对旧中国高等教育某些可用的东西也轻易地否定。同时对苏联先进经验本身未进行系统的研究。在学习苏联先进经验时，忽视了学习东欧人民民主国家和欧美资本主义国家某些有用的东西。例如有些欧美资本主义国家为着培养科学技术水平较高的科学技术干部，理科和工科可以合在一起建立理工学院；有些国家高等学校专业分的较粗，科学知识基础打的较深厚，专业知识学的较少，因将来到工作岗位上还可以自修；必修课程适当地减少，选修课程适当地增加，以适应各个学生不同的学习要求，这些地方还是值得我们研究参考的。同时，学校在向学生进行集体主义教育和纪律教育时，过分地强调了集体统一和组织纪律，而忽视了“保障广大人民自由发展其在共同生活中的个性”的原则；在进行“身体好、学习好、工作好”的教育时，片面地强调了身体好就是劳卫制锻炼及格，学习好就是门门功课五分，工作好就是参加过多的社会活动。正由于教条主义毛病和忽视自由发展学生在共同生活中的个性，因而造成目前各校或多或少地存在着学生学习负担过重和生活上机械刻板的限制，阻碍了对于学生独立思考和独立工作能力的培养。虽然这些毛病已在纠正中，但是，应该由此来吸取经验教训。
    由此可知，目前我国高等教育所存在着的两个根本性质的问题：一是客观需要过大和主观条件有限的矛盾，随着也就产生强调数量、忽视质量的倾向；一是在高等学校教学改革过程中所存在着的教条主义即忽视培养学生独立思考与独立工作能力的毛病。其他问题都是由此产生的。
    上述两个根本性质的问题，如果得不到及时的解决，势必会对我国社会主义建设和高等学校本身的发展产生相当严重的后果。我们可以从这几方面来看提高培养干部质量的重要性。
    由于科学技术干部质量降低，它就妨碍我们在三个五年计划期间或者再多一点时间内，建成一个基本上完整的工业体系。要建成一个基本上完整的工业体系，对于科学技术干部的培养要求不仅是数量上要多，而且质量上要好。所谓质量上要好，就是要求高等学校能够培养具有马克思列宁主义理论基础、掌握现代世界科学技术最新成就、身体健康、忠实于祖国社会主义建设事业、个性全面发展的高级建设人才。他们既能够适应我国新建厂矿企业生产方面的要求，又能够在高等学校和科学研究机关胜任教学和研究工作，其中优秀的还可以培养成为达到世界先进水平的高级科学专家。当然，我们并不是说一切学校、专业和每一个毕业生都要达到一律的要求，但我们培养的科学技术干部，应该在原有基础上随着我国社会主义建设和世界科学技术日新月异的进展而逐步有所提高，绝对不能停滞不前或逐步下降。
    由于科学技术干部质量的降低，势必会妨碍我们在第三个五年计划期末争取实现在急需的科学部门接近或赶上世界先进水平的任务。要想在十二年的短时期内，在急需的科学部门接近或赶上世界先进水平，其决定环节是要替这些科学部门培养成套的科学技术干部特别是副博士、博士一级的高级专家，否则接近或赶上世界先进水平就是空话。
    降低培养干部的质量，会对整个教育特别是对高等教育本身造成非常不好的影响。由于高等学校培养的干部质量低，不能一个人顶一个人用，势必会迫使各业务部门要求从数量上来代替质量，一人不顶一人用，就要求两人三人顶一个人用，结果就会迫使高等学校任务越来越大，就会越粗制滥造，越粗制滥造，干部质量就越低，质量越低就要求数量越多，数量越多就会造成质量更低，以至越循环越严重。而高等教育发展越大就逼着高级中学加速发展，高级中学大发展就逼着初级中学大发展，由于普通教育师资和经费供应跟不上去，就造成普通教育的不良后果。
    怎样来克服强调数量、忽视质量的倾向，大力贯彻中国共产党第八次全国代表大会关于政治报告的决议中所指示的“在保证一定质量的条件下，尽可能地继续增加学生的数量”的方针呢？根据我个人的看法，要从以下几方面来着手：
    认真摸清国家建设对于科学技术干部的数量与质量的实际需要和高等学校主观可能的条件，今后对于科学技术干部的培养工作要进行全面的规划，既要大力克服强调数量、忽视质量的倾向，又要注意防止片面地强调质量而忽视数量上的需要。要保证高等学校实现招生计划所必需的基本建设、教学设备、师资补充、人员编制、经费供应等物质条件，没有这些起码的物质条件，要想提高培养干部的质量也是不可能的。一方面我们要反对过去高等学校某些浪费现象，大力贯彻精简节约的方针；但另一方面教学和科学研究所必需的人力、物力和财力也一定要得到保证。通过调查研究来核实各业务部门的实际需要和高等学校主观条件，根据客观需要和主观条件相适应的原则，来编拟1957年和第二个及第三个五年计划期间培养干部的规划，要对好各类专业的口径和确定高级与中级人才合理的比例，要加强业余教育培养科学技术干部的工作，保证正规学校能够培养质量较好的科学技术干部。
    系统地总结建国以来高等教育改革和发展的经验，特别要注意克服在教学工作中的教条主义和忽视学生自由发展其在共同生活中个性的毛病。为此，除了系统地总结建国以来我国高等教育的建设经验外，还要系统地研究苏联及人民民主国家的先进经验，并批判地吸收欧美资本主义国家某些对我们有用的东西。我们必须研究和解决建立为我国社会主义建设服务的新型高等教育的问题。
    各地党组织要加强对高等教育事业的领导，正确地贯彻党的团结教育改造知识分子政策和“百家争鸣、百花齐放”的方针，充分地发挥学校师生员工的积极性和创造性，从各方面来提高高等教育的质量。
