Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 23rd: A team for promoting advanced experiences, organized by the mechanical industry system of Shanxi Province, has recently helped workers in small and medium-sized towns with outdated machinery factories to quickly master advanced technologies through touring technical demonstrations.

This advanced experience dissemination and promotion team traveled throughout seven regions, including Jinan, Changzhi, Yanbei, and Datong, demonstrating and imparting more than ten advanced experiences in thirty-seven machine factories. After these demonstrations and teachings, 380 workers have learned advanced operation methods in cold processing such as reverse cutting tool thread picking, Leonov-style circular milling cutters, large furnace operation in foundry work, and component processing.

The results of the advanced producers performing and imparting advanced experiences on the same machine tools showed that efficiency was increased three to five times compared to the original. This profoundly educated those who previously believed that various advanced experiences could not be implemented on outdated machine tools. For example, workers at the Datong Mining Bureau Machinery Repair Factory used to take two minutes to machine a screw for a combine harvester crusher; Han Shulin, an advanced producer from the demonstration team, used the Soviet high-speed thread picking operation method and only took twenty seconds to machine one on the same lathe.

This advanced experience promotion team consists of nineteen advanced producers and engineering technicians from five factories, including Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory, Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory, and Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory. Whenever they arrive at a factory, they first familiarize themselves with the factory's tools and products, give key demonstrations, and then guide the participants to practice the actual operations. Finally, the technicians explain the principles of the advanced operation methods to the workers until a group of operating workers in each factory has mastered this advanced experience before they leave.

    让先进经验遍地开花结果
    山西省机械工人组织推广队巡回表演
    新华社太原23日电　山西省机械工业系统的一支先进经验推广队，最近通过巡回技术表演，帮助中小城镇设备陈旧的机器厂的工人迅速掌握了先进技术。
    这支先进经验传授推广队，走遍了晋南、长治、雁北、大同等七个地区，在三十七个机器厂表演和传授了十多种先进经验。经过这次表演和传授以后，已经有三百八十个工人学会了冷加工方面的反切刀挑扣，列昂诺夫元片铣刀和铸工方面的大炉操作，以及配件等方面的先进操作方法。
    表演和传授先进经验的先进生产者，在同样机床上操作的结果，效率都比原来提高三倍到五倍。这使过去认为在陈旧的机床上不能推行各种先进经验的人们受了深刻的教育。如大同矿务局机械修理厂工人们过去车康拜因破碎机螺丝的时候，两分钟才能车一个；表演队的先进生产者韩树林运用苏联高速挑扣的操作方法，在同样的车床上只用二十秒钟就能车一个。
    这一支先进经验推广队是由太原重型机器厂、经纬纺织机械厂和太原矿山机器厂等五个厂的十九名先进生产者和工程技术人员组成的。他们每到一处，都先熟悉工厂里的刀具和产品，作重点表演，然后指导参加学习的人实际操作；最后，再由技术人员向工人讲清先进操作方法的原理，直到每个厂有一批操作工人掌握了这种先进经验才离去。
