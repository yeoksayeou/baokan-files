    The Resistance of Port Said Residents Terrified the Aggressors
    Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: According to TASS, Cairo: Newspapers report that Egyptian patriots are actively opposing the imperialist aggressors in Port Said. When the Anglo-French troops withdrew from Egyptian territory, they feared retaliation by the people for the crimes they had committed. Without armed escorts, British and French soldiers dared not go to the streets. The port area used for the withdrawal has been surrounded by barbed wire. Tanks and machine guns are deployed on the roads near Port Said. Armed squads patrol the adjacent streets.
    According to newspaper reports, on the 11th, a British officer went missing on a street in Port Said during the day. The newspaper pointed out that the officer had arrested a large number of Egyptian patriots in Port Said the day before.
    Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: TASS, Cairo, December 12th: According to newspapers, Egypt has issued new medals to commemorate the Battle of Port Said.
    Anyone who participated in the Battle of Port Said and those who were injured during the Anglo-French aggression will be awarded medals.

    埃颁发奖章纪念塞得港保卫战
    塞得港居民的反抗使侵略者丧胆
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社开罗讯：报纸报道，埃及爱国者在塞得港积极反对帝国主义侵略者。英法军队在撤离埃及国土的时候害怕人民对他们所犯下的罪恶进行报复。如果没有武装护送，英、法军人就不敢到大街上去。撤退用的港口区已经围上了铁丝网。塞得港近郊的通道上布置着坦克和机关枪。邻近的街道上都有武装小队巡逻。
    据报纸消息，11日白天在塞得港的一条大街上有一名英国军官失踪。报纸指出，这个军官一天以前在塞得港逮捕了大批埃及爱国者。
    新华社13日讯　塔斯社开罗12日讯：据报纸报道，为了纪念塞得港保卫战，埃及颁发了新的奖章。
    凡是参加过保卫塞得港战役的人以及在英、法侵略时期受了伤的人，都将荣获奖章。
