　　Horns Grown Later
      (Mongolian Proverb) The horns grown later are longer than the ears that grew first. A person without willpower has a long way to go, and a person without faith is far from the Buddha. The winter cold follows the spring, and the elders' instructions are for the youth.

　　后生出的犄角
      （蒙古谚语）后生出的犄角，比先长的耳朵长。没有意志的人前程远，没有信仰的人佛爷远。冬季的寒冷接春天，前辈的嘱托在青年。
