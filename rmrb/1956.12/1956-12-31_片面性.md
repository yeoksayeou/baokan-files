    One-Sidedness
    In the advanced producer movement, the Dalian Steel Plant once stipulated a "New Record Award," stipulating that as long as a new record was created today, a bonus could be obtained tomorrow. After the implementation of this reward system, workers straining their physical strength, chasing output, and damaging equipment all occurred. Some workers even deliberately created difficulties for workers on the next shift in order to create new records. Some workers, when the work was easy, desperately tried to create new records; when the work was difficult, their enthusiasm waned.
    Using material rewards to encourage workers' labor enthusiasm is inherently correct, but why did it lead to bad results? Because "one-sidedness" seeped in, only thinking about economics and not about politics; only thinking about the immediate and not about the long-term; only thinking about the local and not about the overall; only thinking about output and not about safety.

    片面性
    大连钢厂在先进生产者运动中，曾经规定了一种“新纪录奖”，只要今天创造了新纪录，明天就可以拿到奖金。实行这种奖励以后，工人拼体力、追产量、弄坏设备的事都出现了。有的工人为了创造新纪录，甚至故意给下班工人制造困难。有的工人遇到活好干，就拼命创造新纪录；活不好干，干劲就松了下来。
    用物质奖励来鼓舞工人的劳动热情，本来是正确的，可是为什么得到了不好的结果呢？因为，里面渗进了“片面性”，只想到经济，没有想到政治；只想到一时，没有想到长远；只想到局部，没有想到整体；只想到产量，没有想到安全。
