Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, December 9th. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Yu Fengyuan reports): At 1:35 PM today, the track-laying troops of the Yingxia Railway, who had pierced mountains and crossed the sea to advance into Xiamen Island, hammered the last spike into the end of the rail at Xiamen Station. With this, the entire track-laying project of the 697.72-kilometer-long Yingxia Railway has been completed. The Yingxia Railway has been victoriously completed one year ahead of schedule.

This morning, people from all walks of life in Xiamen City put on festive attire and joyfully rushed to the station to welcome the arrival of the track-laying army. At around 11:00 AM, as the Chiang Kai-shek army artillery on Kinmen Island shelled Xiamen Island, the whistle of the track-laying train entering Xiamen Station pierced the sky above Xiamen City for the first time. At this moment, thousands of people excitedly waved flowers and red flags, welcoming the track-laying train and paying tribute to the glorious railway construction army. An endless stream of people followed the rapidly advancing officers and soldiers of the track-laying unit into the station.

Led by advanced producers such as the "rail-pulling expert" Huang Pei, the officers and soldiers of the track-laying unit advanced at a rapid pace amidst the cheers of the crowd lining the streets. When they laid the last pair of rails on the sleepers, tightened the bolts, and hammered in the spikes, it was exactly 1:35 PM. "The Yingxia Railway is completed!" "Salute to the railway construction army!" The enthusiastic cheers and the long whistles of the track-laying train intertwined into a chaotic roar, shaking the vast ocean. The people presented thousands of flowers and precious gifts to the railway construction soldiers.

Subsequently, Xiao Feng, Secretary of the Xiamen Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, acting Mayor Li Wenling, Wang Yanan, President of Xiamen University, and representatives of the Xiamen Garrison presented flowers to the officers and soldiers of the track-laying unit to express their gratitude. Amidst warm applause and cheers, Colonel Jia Qingxiang, head of the track-laying unit, presented two pairs of small rails and a hammer used to hammer the last spike of the Yingxia Railway to the people of Fujian Province and Xiamen City, and the faculty and students of Xiamen University, respectively, to thank them for their strong support.

　　鹰厦铁路穿山跨海通到厦门
    据新华社厦门9日电　新华社记者于逢源报道：今天下午一时三十五分，穿山跨海挺进厦门岛的鹰厦铁路铺轨部队已经把最后一颗道钉钉在厦门车站里的钢轨末端上。至此，全长六百九十七点七二公里的鹰厦铁路铺轨工程全部完工。鹰厦铁路提前一年胜利建成了。
    今天清晨，厦门市各界人民就穿上节日的盛装，喜气洋洋地奔向车站，欢迎铺轨大军的到来。十一时许，当金门岛上的蒋军炮兵向厦门岛轰击的时候，驶进厦门车站的铺轨列车的汽笛声第一次划破了厦门市上空。这时，成千上万的人们激奋地挥舞着鲜花和红旗，迎向铺轨列车跟前，向光荣的筑路大军致敬。川流不息的人群又随着迅速前进的铺轨部队官兵拥进车站。
    铺轨部队官兵由“拉轨能手”黄沛等先进生产者为前导，在万众夹道欢呼中，以飞快的速度铺进。当他们把最后一对钢轨铺到枕木上，拧紧螺丝钉和钉上道钉的时候，正是十三点三十五分。“鹰厦路修通了！”“向筑路大军致敬！”狂热的欢呼声和铺轨列车的汽笛长鸣声交织成嘈杂的一片，震撼着辽阔的海洋。人民把千万朵鲜花和珍贵的礼物献给筑路官兵。
    接着，中共厦门市委员会书记肖枫、代理市长李文陵，厦门大学校长王亚南和厦门驻军代表向铺轨部队官兵献花致谢。铺轨部队首长贾庆祥上校在热烈的掌声和欢呼声中，把两对小钢轨，一把钉下鹰厦铁路最后一颗道钉的铁锤等，分别献给了福建省、厦门市人民和厦门大学师生，感谢他们的大力支援。
