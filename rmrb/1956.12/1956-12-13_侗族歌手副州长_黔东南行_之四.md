    After watching the bullfight in Yangliuwan, it was already dusk. I walked slowly along the winding long street of Zhenyuan with a group of prefectural people's representatives, talking and returning to our residence together.
    A young farmer with a dark complexion came hurrying from the roadside and the stone bridge over the Wuyang River. He smiled and said to us with great concern, "You went to see the bullfight, didn't you? You must all be tired and hungry, and should go back to rest and prepare for dinner."
    A faint blush appeared on the young man's face, and we all smelled the intoxicating aroma of alcohol on his breath.
    Someone asked, "Director, you probably had a little drink again?"
    "I didn't drink much," the young farmer replied in a hearty voice. "The Sichuan Opera Troupe performed for the conference and the masses for several nights in a row, and the actors were too tired. Today we had a gathering, and I went to accompany them for a few drinks. Think about what kind of lives we lived before liberation, and what kind of lives we live today. The wishes of the minority nationalities for many years have finally been fulfilled this time. Shouldn't we be happy? You representatives should drink more wine later! I'll accompany you!"
    What a cheerful personality, he immediately attracted me. As I walked, I kept my eyes fixed on this young man! He was not tall, but very strong; his face was oval, with slightly prominent cheekbones; a pair of bulging eyes; his eyebrows were light, but relatively long. At first glance, he was a clever person. He wore a roll of dark, multi-layered blue cloth turban on his head, a shiny Dong blue cloth short jacket, patterned short socks, and cloth shoes. His whole body was full of youthful vitality. He walked forward hand in hand with the representatives, talkative, straightforward, lively in demeanor, and so affectionate to people. As soon as he entered the dining room, the young man quickly disappeared into the crowd. When it came time to toast, he happily appeared in front of us again.
    Later, I inquired from others and learned that he was Liang Wanggui, the county magistrate of Congjiang County and deputy director of the prefectural preparatory committee. I suddenly remembered that I had met him once at the provincial people's representative conference. He was only twenty-nine years old, a Dong folk singer and poet who could also play the reed pipe and the pipa; he had only attended elementary school for a few years, but had a fairly high level of education. Since we were not in the same group at that time, we did not have the opportunity to talk to him in detail.
    The next evening, while watching the performance of the Provincial Song and Dance Troupe, we happened to be sitting together. Liang Wanggui watched the stage with a smile, so excited that his hands and feet were dancing at any moment. He knew that I had been to the Dong villages in Liping, so he asked me if I had learned to sing Dong songs. He made me blush: I could barely speak a few words of Dong dialect; Dong songs, however, stumped me. He said that their Dong songs and Dong operas are very beautiful folk arts, and we should study and explore them in depth. He felt that the Song and Dance Troupe had learned too little from the Dong ethnic group, and it was still limited to a little bit from Yan'dong in Liping, which was not enough. The young man became more and more excited as he talked; he was also afraid of disturbing the viewing of the neighbors, so he whispered in my ear:
    "Comrade, why don't you come to our Congjiang to have a look? Our home is on the Dujiang River, near the Damiao Mountains of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. There are ancient trees and fir mountains everywhere. Most of the people in our Congjiang are Dong and Miao, and there are only more than 10,000 Han people. The Dujiang River alone solves the livelihood problems of our farmers. Wooden boats also go to Sandu, and the scenery is very beautiful. It's simply a poetic environment, and I'm going to write poetry to praise it. If you don't believe me, come and see for yourself."
    I nodded and said, "Okay, I will definitely go there to visit and learn sooner or later."
    A representative with a bushy beard in the front row suddenly turned around and asked kindly, "Director Liang, do you still often sing now?"

    侗族歌手副州长
  　——“黔东南行”之四
    蹇先艾
    在杨柳湾看完了斗牛之后，已经是黄昏时候了。我同一群州人民代表在镇远那条迤逦的长街上缓缓地走着，谈着，一起回到住所去。
    一个年轻的，面貌黧黑的农民，跨着十分轻快的步子，从马路旁、?阳河边的石桥上急急忙忙地赶来了。他微笑着很关心地对我们说：“你们看牛打架去了不是？大家一定都累了，饿了，该回去歇歇气，准备吃晚饭了。”
    小伙子的脸上，淡淡地露着一层红晕，我们都嗅出来了他的嘴上的醺人的酒气。
    有人就问道：“主任，你大概又喝了一点吧？”
    “我喝得并不多。”青年农民用爽朗的声音回答说。“川剧团给大会跟群众一连演了几晚上的戏，演员们太辛苦了；今天聚餐，我去陪他们喝了几杯。你们想想：解放前，我们过的是什么日子，今天，又过的是什么日子。少数民族多少年的心愿，这回才遂了，难道说还不应该高兴高兴吗？你们各位代表等一会儿，也要多喝点酒啊！我来陪你们！”
    这是一个多么爽快的性格，他立刻就把我吸引住了。一边走路，我一边目不转睛地注意这位青年！他的身材不高，很结实；面孔椭圆，微微露了一点颧骨；一双鼓鼓的眼睛；眉毛淡淡的，但是比较长。一望而知是一个聪明人。他的头上盘着一卷颜色很深的、重重叠叠的青布帕子，身上穿着发亮的侗青布短褂，花短袜，布鞋。全身都充满了青春的活力，他同代表们手挽着手地往前走，健谈，直率，举止活泼，对人又是那么亲热。进了饭厅，小伙子很快地就在人丛中消失了。到了敬酒的时候，他又快快乐乐地出现在我们的面前。
    后来，我向别人打听，才知道他原来就是从江县县长兼州筹委会副主任梁旺贵。我忽然想起了，在省人民代表会议上，曾经和他见过一次面。他才二十九岁，是一个侗族的歌手、诗人，还会吹芦笙，弹琵琶；只读过几年小学，却有相当高的文化程度。由于当时我们不在一个小组，也就没有机会同他详谈。
    第二天晚上，看省歌舞团的演出，我们凑巧坐在一处。梁旺贵笑吟吟地望着台上，兴奋得手足随时都在舞蹈着。他知道我到过黎平侗族的乡村，就问起我学会唱侗歌没有。把我弄得面红耳赤：侗话，我倒勉强还会说几句；侗歌，可就把我考住了。他说，他们的侗歌、侗戏都是很优美的民间艺术，我们应当深入地去研究和发掘。他觉得歌舞团学到侗族的东西实在太少了，还只限于黎平岩洞的一点一滴，那是不够的。这位青年越谈越起劲；他又怕扰乱了邻座的视听，便轻声在我耳边说：
    “同志，你为什么不到我们从江来看看呢？我们的家就在都江上，靠近桂西僮族自治州的大苗山，古树成林，到处都是杉山。我们从江的老百姓大部分都是侗族和苗族，汉族只有一万多人。一条都江就解决了我们庄稼人的生活问题。木船还通三都，风景好看得很，简直是一个诗的环境，我还预备写诗来歌颂它呢。你不信，来看看就晓得了。”
    我点头说：“好，我早迟一定会到你们那里去观光和学习的。”
    前排一位胡须蓬茸的代表忽然转过头来，亲切地问道：“梁主任，你现在还常常唱歌吗？”
