Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 3rd: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, in a conversation with reporters in Augusta on December 2nd, admitted that there are "certain tensions" within the North Atlantic Group due to the sharp differences between Western countries on Middle East policy.

Evidently addressing this situation, Dulles, in a statement he read out at the beginning, emphasized that the United States demands continued strengthening of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Dulles' statement was made after his meeting with Eisenhower. Using the so-called "Soviet actions in Eastern Europe" as an excuse, he advocated "making the North Atlantic Treaty Organization a stronger and more effective organization in the areas of particular concern to it."

Dulles attempted to patch up the divisions shown by the United States, Britain, and France on the Middle East issue, saying that the deterioration of relations between the United States and Britain and France "is mainly due to misunderstandings, which are gradually being clarified."

He said that recently these three countries have been trying to improve relations, and one example of improving relations is that the United States is taking steps to ensure the supply of oil to Western Europe.

Regarding the Middle East issue, Dulles insisted that the prospects for peace there are "quite good." However, he refused to discuss the issue of Syria, that is, the dangerous situation created in the Middle East by the readiness of some countries to invade Syria. Dulles also said that since the conclusion of the Baghdad Pact, the issue of the relationship between the United States and the contracting parties to the treaty has been under consideration. The United States has participated in the organization's meetings and has representatives on the Economic Committee. However, he said he did not know what the State Department's current view is on whether the United States should join the Baghdad Pact.

As for the policy towards neutral countries, Dulles said he did not know "whether the United States government is pursuing a policy of promoting relations with neutral countries."

Dulles also spoke about the U.S. policy of "liberation" towards the People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe. This time, he emphasized the use of so-called "gradual" methods to subvert democratic regimes, saying that "Voice of America" has consistently advocated this method.

    杜勒斯承认美英法关系恶化
　　北大西洋集团内部局势紧张
  　继续叫嚣用“渐进”办法颠覆人民民主国家
    据新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯12月2日在奥古斯大向报界发表谈话时承认，由于西方国家在中东政策上的尖锐分歧，北大西洋集团内部存在着“一定程度的紧张局势”。
    显然是针对这种情势，杜勒斯在他开头宣读的一项声明中强调地说，美国要求继续加强北大西洋集团组织。
    杜勒斯的这项声明是在他同艾森豪威尔会谈之后发表的。他用所谓“苏联在东欧”的行动作借口，鼓吹“使北大西洋公约组织在它特别有关的地区内成为一个更加强大和更加有效的组织”。
    杜勒斯力图弥缝美、英、法三国在中东问题上表现出来的分歧，他说，美国同英法关系的恶化“主要是由于误会引起的，而这些误会正在逐渐澄清”。
    他说，最近这三个国家都在设法改进关系，而改进关系的例子之一就是美国正在采取步骤来保证向西欧供应石油。
    谈到中东问题，杜勒斯硬说，在那里的和平前景“相当好”。但是他却拒绝谈论叙利亚问题，就是由于一些国家准备侵略叙利亚而在中东造成的危险局势。杜勒斯还说，自从巴格达条约缔结以来，就一直在考虑美国同这个条约的各缔约国间的关系问题。美国已经参加了这个组织的会议，并且在经济委员会中派有代表。然而他表示他不知道国务院目前对于美国是否应当参加巴格达条约问题的看法如何。
    至于对中立国家的政策，杜勒斯说，他不知道美国政府“是否在执行促进同中立国家的关系的政策”。
    杜勒斯还谈到美国对东欧人民民主国家的“解放”政策。他这一次强调要用所谓“渐进”的办法来颠复民主政权，他说“美国之音”就一贯地主张用这种方法。
