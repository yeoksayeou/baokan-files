    Comprehensively Plan and Construct Mountainous Areas
    Recently, several provinces and regions have convened mountainous area work conferences to study and formulate long-term plans for the construction of mountainous areas, and to help the people in mountainous areas overcome specific difficulties in their current production and lives. In order to comprehensively promote and strengthen work in mountainous areas, this is absolutely necessary.
    The counties in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas of our country account for more than half of all counties in the country, and the population in mountainous areas accounts for about one-third of the national population. From a national perspective, mountainous areas are rich in resources, have many avenues for production, and have great potential, with natural conditions suitable for developing diversified operations. Of course, the further development of the mountainous economy and the further improvement of the lives of people in mountainous areas do indeed have their own special difficulties. However, as long as attention is paid to developing a diverse economy, mutual support can be provided and overall development achieved. This can not only prosper the mountainous economy, increase people's income, and change the face of impoverished mountainous areas; but also further meet the needs of the state and the people for agricultural and sideline products, and local specialties.
    Over the past few years, mountainous area construction has achieved certain results. However, the degree of production development and improvement in people's lives in most mountainous areas still lags far behind that of plain areas. Many resources that could be developed in mountainous areas have not been developed, and land that could be utilized has not been utilized, or is being utilized very unreasonably, such as reclaiming steep slopes, destroying forests for grain, resulting in soil erosion and man-made disasters. Many local specialties in mountainous areas cannot continue to develop due to a lack of necessary support, or because transportation, pricing, and sales issues have not been well resolved, and some have even seen a decrease in production. This makes it impossible to improve production in mountainous areas and the people's lives cannot be improved as they should be. In the development of socialist construction throughout the country, the people in mountainous areas urgently demand to develop mountainous areas and move forward in step with the various construction undertakings of the country. All leadership organs and leaders in mountainous areas have the responsibility to strengthen overall planning and strive to build mountainous areas in order to meet the ardent demands of the broad masses in these areas.
    The backward state of mountainous area construction is inseparable from insufficient emphasis in leadership thinking and generalized leadership methods. For example, some people believe that barren mountains and old gullies have "little profit" and increased production cannot rely on mountainous areas. Some people feel that mountainous areas are not the focus of socialist construction, and so on. Although there are vast mountainous areas within their scope of leadership, when they plan and deploy work, they focus on plain areas, and cannot comprehensively consider problems and specifically guide production based on the different characteristics of mountainous and plain areas. Under the influence of this one-sided view, they depart from the reality of mountainous areas, simply emphasize increasing grain and cotton production, and neglect the development of diversified economies. They use the methods of leading plain area production to lead mountainous area production, and some even use crude commandist methods to force people in mountainous areas to carry out production according to the methods of the plains. When the masses express that they cannot accept this generalized, subjective, and doctrinaire leadership, these comrades not only fail to examine themselves, but instead blame the people in mountainous areas for "not being socialist-conscious enough" and say they are "disobedient."
    In mountainous areas, there are many staff members who travel across mountains and ridges year after year, leading the people in mountainous areas in production and construction, helping them solve difficult problems, and sharing weal and woe with them, receiving the love and support of the people in mountainous areas. However, there are also leaders in many areas who do not care enough about the sufferings of the people in mountainous areas, do not understand their difficulties and demands, and are unwilling to go deep into the mountainous areas to work. In some mountain villages, no staff members have gone for several years, there is no one to care about their sufferings, and no one to help solve their problems. Some people therefore complain that "old cadres forget the mountains after they leave them." They cannot see their own future and gradually lose confidence in the construction of mountainous areas. Some say: "The socialist future is great, mountain villages don't count." Some say: "Socialism cannot climb mountains." Many people have developed "down-the-mountain thoughts."
    These thoughts and emotions of the people in mountainous areas reflect some of the problems that exist in leadership work. Only by helping the people in mountainous areas to make overall plans for production and construction, making their direction clear, and letting them see the future, can we encourage their enthusiasm for building mountainous areas. Only by helping the people in mountainous areas solve the specific difficulties in their current production and lives, and maintaining their strong enthusiasm for production, can we encourage their enthusiasm for realizing long-term plans and strengthen their confidence in realizing socialism in mountainous areas.
    Mountainous area production planning is a complex and comprehensive work. The purpose of the plan is to comprehensively arrange the rural economy of the mountainous areas, so that the production of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline industries can be fully developed, and to determine the current and long-term construction steps, guidelines, and tasks according to the characteristics and possible conditions of each region, gradually carry out comprehensive development, and combine the diverse economies of the mountainous areas with the development of the entire national economy. To do this work well, on the one hand, relevant departments such as agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy need to cooperate and act together, plan uniformly, cooperate with each other, and avoid conflicts; on the other hand, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and formulate a comprehensive plan for mountainous area production. Only in this way, combining the opinions of the masses with scientific guidance, can the plan truly become a program to guide the production activities of the people in mountainous areas and a goal for long-term struggle. According to such a plan, the people in mountainous areas can know what to do first and what to do later, to what extent their lives can be improved, see the direction of progress in mountainous areas, and also see their own bright future. In this way, their enthusiasm for building mountainous areas will be greatly developed. At the same time, in terms of leadership, it will also be possible to effectively overcome generalization and blindness. Phenomena such as "opening up the mountains and冲 the plains" can be avoided. The one-sided approach of only focusing on grain and cotton production while ignoring other things can also be changed. Since the natural conditions in mountainous areas are complex and diverse, long-term plans and specific plans need to have great flexibility, so that townships or cooperatives can play a more active role and develop production in accordance with local conditions.
    Mountainous area production planning work, after two or three years of key promotion, has accumulated some preliminary experience and cultivated some cadres who are capable of this work. After the realization of agricultural production cooperativization, mountainous areas can further release their huge production potential. In the recently issued "Notice on Actively Developing Rural Winter Production" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, it is required that all counties with mountainous areas in each province should regard mountainous area production as a major issue, step up investigation and research, and formulate development plans. All regions should, in accordance with the spirit of the notice, specifically help agricultural cooperatives in mountainous areas formulate current and long-term production plans, and fully carry out agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production in mountainous areas.
    Most of the mountainous areas in our country are old revolutionary base areas. The people in these areas have a higher level of consciousness and a tenacious fighting spirit. In the past, in the difficult years of the revolutionary war, they sweated and bled to win the victory of the revolution. Today, in the construction of socialism, they have shown even greater enthusiasm. As long as we strengthen leadership, make good plans for mountainous area production, and give them specific help, they will certainly, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," and use even greater enthusiasm to turn the barren mountainous areas into prosperous and wealthy socialist new mountainous areas.

### 全面规划建设山区

    全面规划建设山区
    最近几个省、区分别召开了山区工作会议，研究制定建设山区的长远规划，帮助山区人民克服当前生产、生活中的具体困难等问题。为了全面推动和加强山区工作，这是十分必要的。
    我国山区和半山区的县，约占全国所有县的半数以上，山区人口约占全国人口的三分之一。从全国范围来看，山区资源丰富，生产门路多、潜力大，有适于开展多种经营的自然条件。当然，山区经济的进一步开发和山区人民生活的进一步改善，确实有它的特殊困难。但是，只要注意发展多种经济，就可以互相支援，全面发展。这不仅可以繁荣山区经济，增加人民收入，使贫困的山区面貌改观；而且可以进一步满足国家和人民对农副业产品和土产特产的需要。
    几年来山区建设有一定的成绩。但是，多数山区生产发展和人民生活改善的程度还远远落后于平原地区。许多山区有条件开发的资源没有开发，可以利用的土地没有利用，或是利用得很不合理，如陡坡开荒，毁林种粮，以致水土流失，造成人为灾患。许多山区的土产特产，由于缺乏必要的支持，或因交通运输、价格、销路等问题没有很好解决，不能继续发展，有些甚至减产。这样就使山区生产不能提高，人民的生活也不能得到应有的改善。在全国社会主义建设的发展中，山区人民迫切要求开发山区，跟随全国各种建设事业步伐一致地向前迈进。所有山区的领导机关和领导人员有责任加强全面规划，努力建设山区，以满足广大山区群众的热情要求。
    山区建设的落后状况，和领导思想上的重视不够以及一般化的领导方法是分不开的。比如，有些人认为荒山老沟“油水不大”，增产不能指靠山区。有些人觉得山区不是建设社会主义的重点，等等。尽管在他们的领导范围内有广大的山区，而当他们计划和布置工作的时候，却偏重于平川地区，不能根据山区、平原不同的特点，全盘考虑问题，具体指导生产。在这种片面观点的影响下，他们离开山区的实际，单纯强调粮棉增产，忽视发展多种经济。他们用领导平原地区的方法来领导山区生产，有些甚至用粗暴的命令主义的方式强迫山区人民按照平原的办法进行生产。当群众对这种一般化的主观主义的领导表示不能接受的时候，这些同志不但不能反求诸己，反而埋怨山区人民“社会主义觉悟不高”，说他们“不听话了”。
    在山区，有不少工作人员成年累月翻山越岭，领导山区人民进行生产建设，帮助他们解决困难问题，和他们同甘共苦，受到山区人民的爱戴和拥护。但是，也有不少地区的领导人员对山区人民的疾苦关怀不够，不了解他们的困难和要求，不愿意深入山区工作。有些山区村庄，好几年没有工作人员去，有疾苦无人过问，有问题无人帮助解决。有的人因此埋怨“老干部下了山就忘了山”。他们看不到自己的前途，对山区建设逐渐失去信心。有的说：“社会主义前途大，山庄窝铺不算话。”有的说：“社会主义上不了山。”许多人产生了“下山思想”。
    山区人民这些思想情绪，正反映了领导工作中存在的一些问题。只有帮助山区人民作好生产建设的全面规划，使他们明确方向，看到前途，才能鼓舞他们建设山区的积极性。只有帮助山区人民解决了当前生产、生活中的具体困难，维护他们旺盛的生产热情，才能鼓舞他们实现长远规划的积极性，坚定他们在山区实现社会主义的信心。
    山区生产规划是内容复杂的综合性的工作。规划的目的是全面安排山区农村经济，使农、林、牧、副各业生产得到全面的发展，并且分别地区特点和可能条件，确定当前的和长远的建设步骤、方针和任务，逐步进行综合开发，把山区多种经济同整个国民经济的发展结合起来。要做好这个工作，一方面需要农、林、水利等有关部门配合行动，统一筹划，互相协作，避免冲突；另一方面需要充分发动群众，依靠群众，制定山区生产的全面规划。只有这样，把群众的意见和科学的指导结合起来，规划才能真正成为指导山区人民生产活动的纲领和长期奋斗的目标。根据这样的规划，山区人民可以知道先干什么后干什么，到什么时候生活可以提高到什么程度，看清山区前进的方向，也看清自己美好的前途。这样，他们建设山区的积极性就会大大发挥起来。同时，在领导方面也就可以有效地克服一般化和盲目性。“开了山，冲了川”之类的现象就可以避免了。只抓粮棉而不管其他的片面作法也可以改变了。由于山区自然条件复杂多样，长远的规划和具体的计划都需要有很大的灵活性，使乡或社能够更多地发挥主动性，因地制宜地发展生产。
    山区生产规划工作，经过两三年来的重点推行，已经积累了一些初步的经验，也培养出了一些能够胜任这个工作的干部。实现了农业生产合作化以后，山区已经可以进一步把巨大的生产潜力发挥出来。中共中央和国务院最近发布的关于积极开展农村冬季生产的通知中，要求各省凡有山区的县，都要把山区生产当作一个重大问题，加紧调查研究，定出发展规划。各个地区都应该根据通知的精神，具体帮助山区的农业社定出当前的和长远的生产规划，全力开展山区的农、林、牧和副业生产。
    我国山区大部分是革命老根据地。这些地区的人民有较高的觉悟和顽强的斗争精神。过去，在革命战争艰苦的年代里，他们流汗流血，赢得了革命的胜利。今天，在建设社会主义的时候，他们表现出了更大的热情。只要加强领导，作好山区生产规划，给他们以具体帮助，他们就一定会依照党中央和毛主席的嘱咐，“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，用更高的热情，把贫瘠的山区变成繁荣富裕的社会主义的新山区。
