Xinhua News Agency, Mangya, 4th December – The living welfare of workers in the Qaidam Basin, Qinghai Province, is gradually improving.

　　Recently, the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau implemented a system of rotating vacations for employees. This method was formulated in light of the poor living conditions in Qaidam and the temporary inability to solve the problem of employee family dormitories, in order to encourage employees to work in the basin for the long term with peace of mind. The method stipulates that all employees who have worked in the basin for more than one year will be given three weeks of vacation time each year, not including the time spent traveling to and from home; female employees, in addition to the prescribed maternity leave, will be given fifteen days to leave the basin to settle their children. The units under the Exploration Bureau are also preparing to transfer couples who do not work in the same location to be together.

　　In order to ensure the health of employees, the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau established five nutrition canteens and patient canteens in various units. These canteens provide more fresh meat, vegetables, etc. than ordinary canteens, so that some employees suffering from minor illnesses and physical weakness can join, with the labor union bearing one-half of the food expenses. Units that have not established nutrition canteens receive tonics such as milk powder and white sugar from the Exploration Bureau every month. In October, in addition to moving the employee hospital to Dachaidan, which has better conditions, the bureau also established a sanatorium in Xining.

　　The Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau has also recently purchased movie projectors and various sports equipment for employees to carry out recreational and sports activities. The first skating rink in the Qaidam Basin is about to be built in Dachaidan.

　　In addition, the barber shops, restaurants, photo studios, and sewing shops recently opened by the Qaidam Mining Area Service Company in Dachaidan, Mangya, and other places have also begun operations.

### 柴达木盆地职工生活正逐步得到改善

　　柴达木盆地职工生活正逐步得到改善
    新华社茫崖4日电　青海省柴达木盆地职工的生活福利逐步得到改善。
    最近，青海石油勘探局实行了职工轮流休假的办法。这个办法是根据柴达木生活条件差，职工家属宿舍暂时无法解决的情况，为鼓励职工长期安心在盆地工作而制定的。办法中规定：凡在盆地工作满一年以上的职工，每人每年给予三个星期的休假时间，回家往返途中的时间不计算在内；女职工生育以后，除了规定的产假外给予十五天时间出盆地安置小孩。勘探局所属各单位并且准备把不在一个地方工作的夫妇调在一起。
    为了保证职工身体健康，青海石油勘探局各单位成立了五个营养食堂和病人食堂，这些食堂比一般食堂要多供应些鲜肉、青菜等，以便一些患轻病和身体虚弱的职工入伙，伙食费由工会负担二分之一。没有成立营养食堂的单位，勘探局每月发给他们奶粉、白糖等滋补品。10月间，这个局除把职工医院搬到条件比较好的大柴旦以外，还在西宁成立了一所疗养院。
    青海石油勘探局最近还购买了电影放映机和各种体育用品，供给职工开展文娱体育活动之用。柴达木盆地的第一个滑冰场就要在大柴旦修建。
    另外，柴达木矿区服务公司最近在大柴旦、茫崖等地开设的理发馆、饭馆、照相馆和缝衣店，也已经开始营业。
