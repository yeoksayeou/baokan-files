Autumn Harvest Distribution Must Follow the Mass Line

A few months ago, this newspaper said in an editorial about summer harvest distribution that this year is the first year of basically realizing agricultural collectivization, and farmers should see the superiority of advanced cooperatives based on the actual income of this year. It was summer then, production was in full swing, and it was not yet certain what the year would be like. Now that it is time for the year-end agricultural production summary, farmers are looking for their own answers.

Most agricultural cooperatives have increased production this year. Some have remained the same. And some have decreased production. In the few agricultural cooperatives that have reduced production, the income of the members will inevitably decrease, and effective measures should be taken immediately to remedy this. In some agricultural cooperatives that have increased production, will every member be able to increase their income? Judging from the autumn harvest distribution situation in various regions, without arduous and heavy work, there is still no such guarantee. Because many cooperative cadres lack experience in leading large cooperatives, some agricultural cooperatives once had quite serious extravagance and waste, some agricultural cooperatives had relaxed the valuable sideline production, and some agricultural cooperatives had chaotic management and unclear financial accounts, all of which affected the autumn harvest distribution work.

This year's autumn harvest distribution situation is very complicated. For example, in some large agricultural cooperatives, the production conditions between villages and villages, teams and teams are different, and the number of workdays made by the members varies, and the actual value of the workdays is also different; now that a unified distribution is implemented, it is not easy to satisfy everyone. In many agricultural cooperatives, members who generally work hard and well often emphasize "more work, more gain" and demand more grain; while members with average work performance and fewer workdays also need to have enough rations; at the same time, the state's tasks of collecting agricultural tax and purchasing surplus grain must be guaranteed to be completed as scheduled. Meeting these demands is by no means an easy task. In addition to this, how to subsidize the work points that cooperative cadres earn less due to official duties, how to deal with the remaining issues of production materials when joining the cooperative, etc., are all very complicated.

Can these complex issues be handled well? This depends on what methods people take to deal with them. Income distribution is everyone's business. Cooperative cadres certainly care about it, but members care about it even more than cadres. As long as the cooperative cadres present the truth of the matter to the members, explain to the members the principles for handling these matters, and study specific solutions with the members, relying on everyone's wisdom, solutions can certainly be found. If this mass line method is not adopted, but handled by a few cadres themselves, it will inevitably be thankless and ruin things that could have been done well. The Liugang Agricultural Cooperative in Fucheng District, Yangjiang County, Guangdong Province, owed its members a considerable amount of production investment and labor remuneration. The members demanded that it be paid off in full during the autumn harvest distribution, which made the cooperative cadres very embarrassed. Later, the cooperative cadres separately convened座谈会 (zùotánhuì - a discussion forum) with the members to examine the cooperative's management status, calculate the cooperative's financial revenue and expenditure accounts, and asked everyone to study methods to solve the problem. The members saw that the cooperative did have difficulties and were willing to share the difficulties with the cadres, and voluntarily requested the management committee to only repay part or most of it during the autumn harvest distribution this year, and the remaining part would be paid off next year. In contrast to this situation, the distribution plan of the Huangban Township Agricultural Cooperative in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, was worked out painstakingly behind closed doors by a few cadres, without any consultation with the members. The members saw that the work points were not clearly calculated and the yield was estimated very tightly, and they generally expressed dissatisfaction. More than a dozen households even demanded to withdraw from the cooperative. Different approaches to autumn harvest distribution led to such diametrically opposed results.

Implementing the mass line and relying on the masses to overcome difficulties is a principle that most grassroots cadres understand. However, why did many cadres not do this during the autumn harvest distribution?

Some grassroots cadres have developed a fear of difficulty in the face of the complex autumn harvest distribution tasks. They think: "Everyone discussing, too many people talking, it will be difficult to explain clearly even by the New Year. It is better for the cadres to come forward to calculate the accounts and distribute the grain. As long as the accounts are clear, there will be no problems." These cadres should be told that they are afraid of trouble now, but they will inevitably cause even greater trouble in the future. How can a few people, isolated from the support of the masses, calculate the big accounts clearly behind closed doors? Even if they can calculate it clearly, if the members do not understand how the account was calculated and why it was calculated this way, who can guarantee that they will have no objections? It seems that a lot of work needs to be done to discuss well with the masses now and jointly agree on the distribution method, but this work is very necessary.

Some grassroots cadres dare not mobilize the masses to participate in the distribution work because they set the production increase targets very high this spring, and at that time they publicized how much a workday could be divided. Now that they cannot reach the original standard, they feel embarrassed to change their tune and cannot turn the corner. In fact, this turn must be made, and this tune cannot be changed. The production increase targets set too high in the spring were because everyone lacked experience, not because someone deliberately deceived the members. As long as this situation is explained clearly to the members, the distribution is carried out according to this year's actual harvest, and the production increase targets for next year are set on this basis, the members' understanding can be fully obtained, and everyone's ideological level can be raised a step.

Some grassroots cadres believe that following the mass line in autumn harvest distribution means satisfying whatever the masses demand. Some members demand that grain be distributed first, and the more the better. As for the state's task of collecting agricultural tax and purchasing surplus grain, "we'll talk about it after the distribution is over." Some cooperative cadres followed this backward thinking and agreed to do so. This is of course wrong. Cadres have the responsibility to listen to the opinions of the masses, and also have the obligation to educate and raise the masses. On the issue of autumn harvest distribution, the masses should be patiently persuaded: take into account the present and also the future, take into account oneself and also the country; the distribution ratio should be appropriately determined in accordance with the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on autumn harvest distribution, and the principle of giving priority to the public over the private should be correctly followed, so that the demands of all parties are met.

Before the end of autumn harvest distribution, the broad masses of members often care about how much grain, cash and other physical objects they can get, and whether the cooperative's distribution plan is completely fair and reasonable. In the few agricultural cooperatives that have reduced production, and in those production teams and production groups that have not increased income for various reasons, the masses of members are even more eager to understand the production and income situation of the entire cooperative. Grassroots cadres should introduce these situations to everyone truthfully and comprehensively, and at the same time guide everyone to find the reasons for increasing or decreasing production, and study reasonable distribution and ways to make up for losses. For example, in those agricultural cooperatives and production teams that have reduced production, we can study why this result was obtained? Is it because they suffered from irresistible natural disasters? Is it because the policy of running cooperatives diligently and frugally was not implemented, and extravagance and waste occurred? Is it because they focused on agriculture and lost sideline production, and the cooperative's production increase did not increase its value? Is it because there are problems with the cooperative's management, and these production teams have experienced wasted work, causing the members to make fewer "workdays"? Or is it just that the principle of "to each according to his work" and appropriate care was not reflected in the distribution, and the members who could have been divided more and should have been divided more were divided less? The experience of many places in carrying out the concluding work of autumn harvest distribution proves that as long as the reasons are found, the solutions are also found. The above-mentioned reasons and situations, some of which can be used as experiences and lessons to help cooperatives strengthen their management in the future, and some can even help to do a good job in the current autumn harvest distribution concluding work and correct various unreasonable phenomena.

This year is the first year of basically realizing agricultural collectivization, and most grassroots cadres lack experience in managing large-scale production; when some higher-level leading organs implemented technical reforms, the requirements were too high and too urgent, which led some grassroots cadres to make mistakes of coercion and commandism, arousing some members' dissatisfaction and even causing estrangement between cadres and members. In order to do a good job in the concluding work of autumn harvest distribution and strengthen the unity of cadres and members, cooperative cadres should sincerely conduct self-criticism to the masses when summarizing the experiences and lessons of the year's production, in order to obtain the understanding of the members. The members should understand that the vast majority of cooperative cadres are wholeheartedly trying to run the cooperative well, and the shortcomings and mistakes in their work can be corrected. At this time, they should support the cooperative's cadres and jointly do a good job in the concluding work of autumn harvest distribution.

### 秋收分配要走群众路线

    秋收分配要走群众路线
    几个月以前，本报在一篇关于夏收分配的社论中说，今年是基本上实现农业合作化的第一年，农民们要根据这一年的实际收入的多少，看高级合作社的优越性。当时是夏天，生产正在紧张进行，年景如何还不能定。现在到了全年农业生产总结算的时候，农民们都在寻求自己的答案。
    今年绝大多数农业社是增产的。有一些是不增不减的。还有一些是减产的。在少数减产的农业社中，社员的收入势必减少，应该立即采取有效措施加以补救。在某些增产的农业社中，是不是每个社员都能增加收入呢？从各个地区进行秋收分配的情况看来，如果不进行艰巨繁重的工作，也还没有这种把握。因为许多社干部缺乏领导大型合作社的经验，某些农业社一度存在相当严重的铺张浪费现象，有些农业社曾经放松了很有价值的副业生产，有些农业社经营管理混乱，财务账目不清，这些都影响到秋收分配工作。
    今年秋收分配的情况是很复杂的。比如，在某些大型的农业社里，村和村、队和队之间的生产条件不同，社员们作的劳动日有多有少，劳动日的实际价值也有差别；现在实行统一分配，就不容易使大家全都满意。在许多农业社里，一般劳动又多又好的社员，常常强调“多劳多得”，要求多分粮食；而劳动情况中常和得到劳动日较少的社员，也需要有足够的口粮；同时，国家征收公粮和统购余粮的任务，必须保证如数完成。满足这些方面的要求，绝不是一件容易的事。除此以外，像社干部因公少得的劳动工分怎样补贴，入社的生产资料遗留问题怎样处理等等，都是十分复杂的。
    这些复杂的问题，究竟能不能够处理得好？这要看人们采取什么方法加以处理。收入分配是大家的事，社干部固然很关心，社员比干部更关心。只要社干部把事情的真象摆到社员面前，向社员说清楚处理这些事情的原则，和社员一起研究解决具体问题的办法，依靠大家的智慧，必然可以想出办法来。如果不采取这种群众路线的方法，而由少数干部自己处理，必然费力不讨好，把本来可以办好的事情办坏。广东阳江县附城区刘岗农业社欠下社员相当大的一笔生产投资和劳动报酬，社员要求在秋收分配的时候全部还清，社干部很为难。后来社干部分头召集社员开座谈会，检查这个社的经营管理状况，计算这个社的财政收支账目，请大家研究解决问题的方法。社员看到社里确有困难，都愿意和干部分担困难，自动要求管理委员会在今年秋收分配的时候只还一部分或大部分，其余部分明年还清。同这种情况相反，湖南湘阴县黄板乡农业社的分配方案，是几个干部辛辛苦苦地关着门弄出来的，根本没有同社员商量。社员看到工分算的不清楚，产量估的又很紧，普遍表示不满意，有十几户社员甚至要求退社。秋收分配作法不同，就得到这样截然相反的结果。
    贯彻实行群众路线，依靠群众克服困难，这个道理是多数基层干部都懂得的。可是，在秋收分配的时候，为什么有不少干部并没有这样作呢？
    有些基层干部在复杂的秋收分配任务之前，产生了一种畏难情绪。他们以为：“众人讨论，人多嘴杂，吵到过年也难说清楚。还是干部出头算账分粮的好。只要账目清楚，就没有什么问题了。”应该告诉这些干部，他们现在怕麻烦，将来必然引起更大的麻烦。几个人脱离了群众的支持，关起门来算大账，怎么能够算得清楚？即使真能算得清楚，社员如果不了解这账是怎样算出来的，为什么要这样算，谁能担保他们没有意见？现在很好地和群众商量，共同商定分配办法，看来要作许多工作，但这种工作是非常必要的。
    有些基层干部不敢发动群众参加分配工作，是因为今年春天把增产指标订的很高，当时宣传一个劳动日能分多少多少，现在达不到原定的标准，觉得不好改口，转不过弯。其实，这个弯非转不可，这个口是不能不改的。春天订的增产指标过高，是因为大家缺乏经验，并不是哪个人存心哄骗社员。只要把这种情况对社员说清楚，按照今年的实际收获进行分配，并在这个基础上把明年的增产指标订好，完全可以取得社员的谅解，并把大家的思想水平提高一步。
    有些基层干部认为，在秋收分配中走群众路线，就是群众要求什么，我们满足什么。有些社员要求先分粮食，分的越多越好，至于国家征收公粮和统购余粮的任务，“分剩下了再说”。有些社干部作了这种落后思想的尾巴，也就同意这样作了。这当然是不对的。干部有倾听群众意见的责任，又有教育和提高群众的义务。在秋收分配的问题上，应该耐心地说服群众：顾眼前也要顾将来，顾自己也要顾国家；要按照中共中央和国务院关于秋收分配的指示，适当地确定分配的比例，正确地遵照先公后私的原则，使各方面的要求都得到满足。
    在秋收分配结束以前，广大社员群众经常关心自己到底能分多少粮食、现金和别的实物，关心全社的分配方案是不是完全公平合理。在少数减产的农业社中，在那些因为种种原因没有增加收入的生产队和生产组中，社员群众更是迫切要求了解全社生产和收支的情况。基层干部应该把这些情况真实地全面地介绍给大家，同时引导大家找寻增产或者减产的原因，研究合理分配和弥补损失的办法。譬如，在那些减产的农业社和生产队里，就可以研究为什么得到这样的结果？是因为遭受了不可抗拒的天灾？是因为没有贯彻执行勤俭办社的方针，发生过铺张浪费的现象？是因为抓了农业丢了副业，合作社增产没有增值？是因为社的经营管理有毛病，这些生产队发生了窝工现象，使社员少作了“劳动日”？或者只是在分配的时候没有体现“按劳取酬”和适当照顾的原则，给可以多分、应该多分的社员分少了？许多地方进行秋收分配结尾工作的经验证明：只要找出了原因，也就找出了办法。像上面说的这些原因和情
  况，有的就可以作为经验教训，帮助合作社在今后加强经营管理，有的更可以帮助做好当前的秋收分配结尾工作，把各种不合理的现象纠正过来。
    今年是基本实现农业合作化的第一年，多数基层干部都缺乏管理大生产的经验；有些上级领导机关实行技术改革的时候，要求过高过急，这就使一些基层干部犯了强迫命令的错误，引起某些社员的不满，甚至造成干部、社员之间的隔阂。为了做好秋收分配结尾工作，加强干部、社员的团结，社干部应当在总结全年生产的经验教训的时候，向群众诚恳地进行自我批评，以求得社员的谅解。社员们应该了解绝大多数社干部都是一心想把合作社办好的，他们工作中的缺点和错误，都是可以改正的，在这个时候应该支持社的干部，共同把秋收分配结尾工作搞好。
