　　Commodities Number in the Thousands, Brands Remain the Same Old Story
    Currently, on the market, the brands of various commodities, from cigarettes and matches to daily necessities, from clothing to sweets and pastries, from pens to bicycles, are almost all named "Glory," "Red Star," "People's," "Xinhua," "Red Flag," "Democracy," "Worker-Peasant," "Labor," "Production," and so on. There are thousands of kinds of commodities on the market, but the brands remain the same old story.
    After liberation, those feudalistic and superstitious names like "Golden God of Wealth," "Golden Yuanbao," and those with colonial overtones like "Golay," "APC," etc., are certainly not suitable for use and should be replaced by new names that can reflect the new atmosphere of our new society. However, commodity brands are not slogans, and the government has not made uniform regulations. Why do people keep liking to use these few words?

### 商品千万种，牌子老一套

　　商品千万种，牌子老一套
    现在市场上各种商品的牌子，从香烟、火柴到日用百货，从衣着用品到糖果糕点，从钢笔到脚踏车，几乎到处都是“光荣”、“红星”、“人民”、“新华”、“红旗”、“民主”、“工农”、“劳动”、“生产”等名称。市场上商品千万种，商品的牌子却老一套。
    解放后那些封建迷信的“金财神”、“金元宝”和带有殖民地色彩的“高乐”、“爱皮西”等名称，当然不适合用了，应当采用一些能够表现我国新社会新气象的新名称。但是，商品牌子究竟不是标语口号，政府也没有作统一规定，为什么老喜欢搬这几个字眼呢？
