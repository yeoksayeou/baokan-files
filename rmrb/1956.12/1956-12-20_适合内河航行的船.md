Ships Suitable for Inland Navigation

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Ministry of Transportation recently held a national symposium on the experience of using coal gas engine ships for inland waterways in Nanchang. The meeting affirmed the widespread use of wooden-hulled coal gas engine ships as shallow-draft tugboats in inland navigation.

Wooden-hulled coal gas engine ships are more backward than diesel engine ships, but China's current shipbuilding industrial technology is relatively weak, especially in terms of thin steel plates, mechanical equipment, and liquid fuels, which cannot meet the needs. Therefore, wooden-hulled coal gas engine ships are still worth promoting for a considerable period. This type of ship has many advantages: the hull is light, the draft is shallow, making it suitable for navigating inland rivers with shallow waters and many shoals. At the same time, the wood used to build the hull and the charcoal and anthracite used as fuel can be obtained locally, and the manufacturing cost is only about one-third of that of diesel engine ships, making manufacturing simpler.

    适合内河航行的船
    据新华社讯　交通部最近在南昌召开全国内河煤气机船舶使用经验座谈会。肯定在内河航运中广泛使用木壳煤气机船作为浅水拖轮。
    木壳煤气机船比柴油机船落后，但是中国目前造船工业技术能力比较薄弱，特别是薄钢板、机械设备和液体燃料都不能满足需要，因此木壳煤气机船在相当长的时期内仍然是值得推行的。这种船的优点很多：船身轻、吃水浅、适合在水浅滩多的内河上航行；同时，制造船体的木材和用作燃料的木炭，白煤都可以就地取材，制造成本只有柴油机船的三分之一左右，制造起来也比较简便。
