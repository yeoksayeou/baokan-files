    Kunming, December 21st (Our Newspaper) – Winter production has begun in most parts of Yunnan Province. In Yuxi, Simao, Zhaotong, Chuxiong, Mengzi and other regions where the season comes earlier, winter production has been fully launched; in Qujing, Dali and other regions where the season is later, many districts and townships have also begun production activities.

    In the past month of winter production, all regions have first focused on arranging agricultural activities such as processing early spring crops, accumulating fertilizer, building water conservancy projects, and plowing winter fields. In Lunan and Luoping counties of Qujing region, 40% of the early spring crops have been weeded, and the fertilizer accumulation plan has generally been completed by 34%-40%. Mengzi region, learning from the lessons of water shortages last year, began storing water early this winter. According to statistics from seven counties, 37.7% of the ponds are now full of winter water, and 26.5% of the ponds are half-full. In addition, out of the twelve medium-sized reservoirs in the region, five are already full, and five are half-full. It is estimated that the existing water storage is sufficient for irrigating 580,000 mu of land next year. Plowing and reclamation activities are also actively underway in some areas. Longling County has reclaimed 4,121 mu of wasteland in addition to plowing fields.

    While carrying out agricultural production activities, agricultural cooperatives in various regions have also made arrangements for collective sideline occupations and the family sideline occupations of their members. In Luliang County, 123 cooperatives have already launched sideline production activities.

    To adapt to the needs and characteristics of winter production, some regions have also made plans for the use of labor. In many agricultural cooperatives in the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, generally 25% of the labor force is used for processing early spring crops, 10% for reclaiming wasteland, 15% for accumulating fertilizer, 20% for building water conservancy projects, 25% for operating collective and family sideline occupations, and the remaining 5% as a mobile reserve force. With such arrangements, winter production can be carried out more comprehensively.

    Close integration with the work of transitioning to cooperatives and grain work is one of the characteristics of this year's winter production. Except for areas where the work of transitioning to cooperatives started earlier and has now ended, many regions made short-term arrangements for production at the initial stage of preparing for the transition, and then carried out winter production while transitioning to cooperatives, in order to reduce and avoid the confusion of production interruptions during the transition period. However, how to grasp the central link of winter production in many rural works, and how to strengthen political and ideological education after autumn harvest distribution to inspire the production enthusiasm of the masses, are still issues that need to be paid attention to and resolved at present.

    注意安排各种活路　全面规划劳力使用
    云南大部地区冬季生产展开
    目前仍须解决如何抓紧中心环节等问题
    本报昆明21日电　云南省已有大部地区转入冬季生产。季节较早的玉溪、思茅、昭通、楚雄、蒙自等专区，冬季生产已经全面地开展起来；季节较迟的曲靖、大理等专区，也有不少区乡展开生产活动。
    各地在这一个月来的冬季生产中，首先注意安排了小春加工、积肥、兴修水利、翻耕冬田等农事活动。在曲靖专区的路南、罗平等县，已有40％的小春作物经过薅锄，积肥计划一般都已完成34％—40％。蒙自专区接受去年缺水的教训，今冬及早动手蓄水。据七个县的统计，现已有37.7％的塘子积满冬水，26.5％的塘子关起半塘水。此外，全区十二个中型水库中，有五个已经关满，还有五个关了一半，估计现有的蓄水量够明年五十八万亩田灌溉之用。犁田和开荒的活动在有些地区也正积极进行。龙陵县除犁田以外还开了荒地四千一百二十一亩。
    在开展农业生产活动的同时，各地农业社对集体副业和社员的家庭副业也作了安排。陆良县有一百二十三个社已经展开副业生产活动。
    为适应冬季生产的需要和特点，有些地区还对劳动力的使用作出了规划。大理白族自治州的许多农业社，一般是以25％的劳力进行小春加工，10％的劳力开荒，15％的劳力积肥，20％的劳力兴修水利，25％的劳力经营集体副业和家庭副业，另外5％的劳力作为机动后备力量。经过这样安排，冬季生产就比较全面地开展起来。
    密切结合转社工作和粮食工作，是今年开展冬季生产的特点之一。除了转社工作动手较早，现已结束的地区以外，不少地区在酝酿转社的初期，都首先把生产作了短期安排，然后一面转社，一面开展冬季生产，以减少和避免在转社期间生产中断的混乱现象。但是，在许多农村工作中怎样抓紧冬季生产这一中心环节，怎样在秋收分配后加强政治思想教育以鼓舞群众的生产情绪，仍然是当前需要重视解决的问题。　（云南日报编辑部）
