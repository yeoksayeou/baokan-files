    Eliminate Waste in Timber Production
    Assistant Minister of Forestry, Zhang Ziliang
    The timber supply situation is currently generally tight. Not only is the supply of first, second, and third-grade timber tight, but the supply of fourth and fifth-grade timber is also tight. Even the off-grade timber that nobody wanted in the past, and the so-called "fuelwood" pit props that coal mines considered unusable, are now in short supply.
    While the timber supply is so tight, the phenomenon of waste is prevalent in forest industry production. A large amount of good timber, treetop wood, and usable diseased and rotten wood are being lost in many mountain areas. Along animal-powered timber transport routes, forest railways, and rivers used to transport timber, discarded timber can be seen everywhere. According to incomplete statistics from the Chuanxi, Wuminhe, Youhao, and Tiansheng Forest Industry Bureaus, more than 540,000 cubic meters of usable timber have been discarded since 1950 alone. In the Meihua workshop of the Wudaoku Forest Industry Bureau alone, 11,000 cubic meters of timber were discarded on transport roads in the four years from 1952 to 1955.
    Due to poor storage, the widespread and serious phenomenon of timber decay and deterioration is also common. In June of this year, the State Forestry Inspectorate inspected twelve timber yards in the South and North and found that timber decay and deterioration were widespread. The Wuminhe Forest Industry Bureau's timber yard alone had more than 46,000 cubic meters of decayed and deteriorated timber.
    Wasteful phenomena such as excessively high stumps in felling, unreasonable cutting off of heads and tails in timber production, and the use of red pine to build houses in forest farms, and burning good timber and branches together are also very serious.
    In order to alleviate the tight timber supply situation, the forestry industry departments must eliminate the phenomena of lost and wasted timber. First of all, we should correct the idea that "there are forests everywhere, it doesn't matter if we lose or waste a little." It should be understood that China's forest resources are not very rich. The forest area only accounts for 7.9% of the total land area. The national forest stock volume, calculated on the basis of a population of 600 million, averages only eight cubic meters per person. Timber is an important material in national construction. As various national construction projects develop, the demand for timber will also increase. However, the growth of timber is very slow. It takes decades or even more than a hundred years for a tree to grow before it can be felled and utilized. According to the growth of China's forest resources and timber, it is preliminarily estimated that by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, the state's demand for timber will still be 10 million cubic meters short of the actual possible supply. Therefore, the situation of timber supply falling short of demand is long-term, and our task of saving timber is also long-term.
    Secondly, we must guarantee timber conservation from the organizational system and production methods. In the past, the waste caused in timber production was mainly due to no one being responsible. In the future, we must strengthen the responsibilities of section chiefs, inspectors, and work team leaders, and delegate responsibilities, powers, and methods to them. In terms of system, we must conscientiously implement the area-based, numbered, and assigned responsibility system, and thoroughly implement the handover, acceptance, and inspection systems. In terms of production methods, felling operations must conscientiously implement the one-time flow-line operation method of felling, pruning branches, clearing the forest farm, and burning branches at the same time. The remaining roots must meet the specified standards, and can only be lowered, not raised. In timber production, we must overcome the unreasonable phenomenon of cutting off heads and tails, and we must also try our best to produce and utilize off-grade timber and diseased and rotten wood that has utilization value. In terms of timber collection, we must promote the Xing'an Logging Yard of the Tieli Forest Industry Bureau's experience of "pulling a stack, clearing a stack; opening a stack, sealing a stack; and not losing a single piece of timber" in loading and transporting timber. In timber yards, all timber, regardless of quality and size, must be stacked separately according to quality. Do not discard or use small pieces of timber casually.
    In order to eliminate the phenomenon of timber waste, we must also actively do a good job in the processing of waste timber. In some forest areas, the proportion of waste timber is very large. For example, in the Dahailin Laoling Forest Area and the Tieli Forest Area, waste timber accounts for about half of all timber. If a small waste timber processing plant is set up in these forest areas' mountain areas or timber yards, and some of the usable good timber in the waste timber is processed and cut, a lot of useful timber can be added.
    In the past, no one was responsible for the problem of burning timber in forest areas (burning unusable branches to avoid hindering forest regeneration), and many usable timber were often burned. In the future, burning timber in forest areas should also follow a certain production procedure, and the inspector should be responsible for checking to avoid burning usable timber casually.
    Now is the season for winter timber transportation. We should publicize the importance of timber conservation to all forest area workers and peasant brothers who come to support timber production in forest areas. The leaders of various logging yards, forest railway departments, and timber yards should often check the timber conservation situation below.

### 消除木材生产中的浪费现象

    消除木材生产中的浪费现象
    森林工业部部长助理　张子良
    目前木材供应情况普遍紧张，不仅一、二、三等材供应紧张，四、五等材供应也紧张，甚至连过去人人不愿意要的等外材、煤矿上认为不能用的所谓“薪炭”坑木等，现在也缺货了。
    木材供应如此紧张，但是目前在森林工业生产中却普遍存在着浪费现象。不少山场上丢失着大量的好材、梢头木和有利用价值的病腐木；在畜力运材的道路上、森林铁路上和运木材的河道两旁，也到处可以看到丢掉的木材。根据川西、乌敏河、友好、田升等四个森林工业局的不完全统计，从1950年以来，仅丢弃的可用木材就有五十四万多立方公尺。五道库森林工业局仅梅花一个车间，从1952年到1955年四年当中，丢弃在运材道上的木材就有一万一千立方公尺。
    由于保管得不好，大量的木材腐朽变质现象也是普遍而严重的。今年6月，国家林业监察局检查了南方北方十二个贮木场，发现普遍都有腐朽变质的木材，仅乌敏河森林工业局的贮木场就有腐朽变质的木材四万六千多立方公尺。
    在采伐中伐根过高，造材中不合理地截头去尾，以及林场上用红松盖房子，拿好材和枝桠一块烧掉等浪费木材现象也十分严重。
    为了缓和木材供应的紧张情况，森林工业部门必须消除丢失木材和浪费木材的现象。首先应该纠正“满山遍野是森林，丢点浪费点没有啥”的思想。要知道，我国森林资源并不是很丰富的，森林面积只占国土总面积的7.9％。全国森林蓄积量，以六亿人口计算，平均每人只有八立方公尺。木材是国家建设中的重要材料。由于国家各项建设日益发展，木材的需要量也将日益增加。但是，木材的成长却非常缓慢，一棵树要生长几十年甚至一百多年才能采伐利用。根据我国森林资源和木材的成长情况来看，初步估计，到第二个五年计划末年，国家对木材的需要量和实际可能供应的数量还相差一千万立方公尺。因此，木材供不应求的情况是长期的，我们节约木材的任务也是长期的。
    其次是必须从组织制度上，从生产方式上来保证节约木材。过去在木材生产中所造成的浪费，主要是无人负责。今后必须加强工段长、验收员和工组长的职责，向他们交职、交权、交办法。在制度上，必须认真贯彻区域分号分工负责制，并彻底执行交接、验收与检查制度。在生产方式上，采伐作业必须认真实行随采伐、随打枝桠、随清理林场、随烧掉枝桠的一次流水作业法。留下的根要合乎规定的标准，只能降低，不能提高。在造材中要克服不合理的去头截尾现象，对有利用价值的等外材和病腐木也要尽量地造材利用。在集材作业方面，要推行铁力森林工业局兴安伐木场的“拉一垛、净一垛；开一垛、封一垛，不丢掉一根木材的装车和运材经验。在贮木场，对所有的木材，不管好坏和大小，都必须按质量分别归垛，不要把小木材随便丢弃，随便使用。
    为了消除浪费木材的现象，还必须积极做好废材的加工工作。有的林区废材比重很大，如大海林老岭林区、铁力林区，废材都占全部木材的一半左右，如果在这些林区的山场或贮木场设立个小型的废木加工场，把废材中部分可用的好材加工割制，就可以增加不少有用的木材。
    林区烧材（把不能用的枝桠烧掉，以免妨碍森林的更生）问题，过去无人负责，经常把许多有利用价值的木材烧掉。今后林区烧材也应按一定的生产程序，并由验收员负责检查，以避免把可以利用的木材随便烧掉。
    目前正是冬季运材季节，应该向全体林区职工和来支援林区木材生产的农民兄弟宣传节约木材的重要意义。各伐木场、森林铁路部门、贮木场的领导同志，应该经常检查下面木材的节约情况。
