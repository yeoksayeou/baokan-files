The North Atlantic Council Paris meeting, filled with contradictions and quarrels, has ended. The task assigned to this meeting by the United States was to mend the contradictions and divisions within this military group, especially between the U.S., Britain, and France, which have recently become acute. This was intended to, under the smokescreen of anti-Soviet hysteria, expand international distrust, intensify the arms race, and further worsen the international situation. The meeting's communique shows that this military group will continue to follow the U.S.'s "policy of strength" and wants to achieve "reconciliation" in creating a tense situation. However, this "reconciliation" cannot hide their irreconcilable contradictions in the struggle for spheres of influence and colonial interests. Dulles had to admit that although the meeting "made great efforts to bury the divisions that exist in our unity," it "did not completely eliminate the divisions." The London "Times" still shouted for a "re-evaluation" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and not without reason.

The main contradiction is concentrated on the Middle East issue. The failure of the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt has greatly weakened their position in the Middle East and caused a serious financial and economic crisis. Britain and France originally attempted to coordinate their policies with the United States in the Middle East through this Paris meeting, in order to continue imposing the international management plan for the canal on Egypt and maintain their interests in the Middle East. At the same time, Britain used Turkey and Iraq to threaten and divide other Arab countries, and demanded that the United States join the Baghdad Pact to strengthen Britain's control over the Middle East through this treaty. However, this can only be Britain's wishful thinking. The United States has its own plans. The United States is taking advantage of the situation and is trying to replace Britain and France in the Middle East. Behind the recent Iranian proposal to convene a conference of Muslim countries lies the conspiracy of the United States to establish a Muslim alliance without British participation to replace the Baghdad Pact. Former U.S. Ambassador to India, Bowles, recently believed that the Baghdad Pact had "shortcomings" and that a so-called "vacuum" had appeared in the Middle East, which the United States should immediately fill and adopt another set of measures to expand control over Arab countries. Bowles's argument precisely reveals the U.S.'s enormous aggressive ambitions in the Middle East. It is worth noting that in order to achieve the goal of strengthening control over the Middle East, the United States first attempted to seize the Suez Canal and control Egypt. It wants to use the small favor of allowing Britain and France to participate in the clearing of the canal in exchange for Britain and France acknowledging that the United States occupies a dominant position in the international management of the canal. The fact is already very clear that the U.S.'s conspiracy in the Middle East is the most serious threat to Middle East peace and the independence and sovereignty of Arab countries.

The suggestion put forward by the three-person committee at the Paris meeting to "conduct broader and more intimate consultations" in politics completely exposed the purpose of the United States to further strengthen its dominant position in the North Atlantic Group. Britain and France originally wanted to use this "cooperation" plan to restrict the United States and restrain its activities of taking advantage of the fire and looting of British and French interests, but this request was resolutely rejected by Dulles. He announced that the United States would reserve the right to take unilateral action without consulting its partners in "emergency situations." This was a blow to Britain and France. France complained bitterly that the United States "demands that international rules and regulations be imposed on its allies, while it reserves the right to act outside the scope of these rules and regulations." The United States' partners have once again seen what benefits strengthening the North Atlantic Group can bring them.

Nevertheless, the communique shows that Britain and France still succumbed to the U.S.'s demand to further force its allies to strengthen their land, sea, and air forces. In the past seven years, North Atlantic Group countries have spent more than 360 billion U.S. dollars on expanding armaments, putting Britain, France, and other countries in serious financial and economic difficulties. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Macmillan openly shouted that Britain could no longer continue to shoulder this heavy burden. However, the United States still intends to allocate more than 500 million U.S. dollars to force its allies to raise their forces to "planned levels."

The Paris meeting issued a clamor for expanding armaments, "atomic retaliation," and resisting Soviet disarmament proposals. In order to cover up their continued activities of expanding armaments and preparing for war, they rehashed the cliché of the so-called "Soviet threat" and made hysterical noises about the Hungarian incident. It is clear that the power groups at the Paris meeting are making every effort to poison the international atmosphere, divert people's attention from their new arms expansion and aggression plans, and prevent the easing of tensions.

### 北大西洋集团矛盾重重

    北大西洋集团矛盾重重
    充满矛盾和争吵的北大西洋公约理事会巴黎会议已经结束了。美国给这次会议规定的任务是，弥补这个军事集团内部特别是美、英、法之间最近趋于尖锐化的矛盾和分歧，以便在反苏歇斯底里叫嚣的烟幕下，扩大国际间的不信任，加强军备竞赛，使国际局势继续趋向恶化。会议公报表明，这个军事集团将继续追随美国的“实力政策”，并想在制造紧张局势方面取得“和解”。但是，这种“和解”并不能掩盖它们在争夺实力范围和殖民利益上的不可调和的矛盾。杜勒斯不能不承认，会议虽然“作了很大的努力来埋葬我们的团结中存在的分歧”，但是“没有完全消除分歧”。伦敦“泰晤士报”不是没有根据地仍然喊出要对北大西洋公约组织作出“重新估价”。
    主要的矛盾集中在中东问题上。英法侵埃战争的失败，使它们在中东的地位大为削弱，并造成财政经济的严重危机。英法两国原企图通过这次巴黎会议来协调它们同美国在中东的政策，以便把国际管理运河的计划继续强加在埃及身上，并保持它们在中东的利益。与此同时，英国利用土耳其和伊拉克来威胁和分化其他阿拉伯国家，并要求美国参加巴格达条约，来加强英国控制中东的这个条约。但是，这只能是英国的单相思，美国却另有自己的打算。美国正在乘人之危，竭力取代英法在中东的地位。最近伊朗建议召开穆斯林国家会议的背后，就隐藏着美国在企图建立没有英国参加的穆斯林联盟来代替巴格达条约的阴谋。前美国驻印度大使鲍尔士最近认为，巴格达条约存在着“缺点”，中东出现了所谓“真空地带”，美国应该立即填补它，另搞一套办法，以扩大对阿拉伯国家的控制。鲍尔士的这一主张恰恰透露了美国对中东的巨大的侵略野心。值得注意的是，为了要达到加强控制中东的目的，美国首先企图夺取苏伊士运河，控制埃及。它想用答应英法参加清理运河的小惠，来换取英法承认美国在国际管理运河上占据支配地位。事实已经很明显，美国在中东进行的阴谋，是对中东和平和阿拉伯国家独立主权的最严重的威胁。
    巴黎会议通过的三人委员会提出的在政治上“进行更广泛更亲切的磋商”的建议，也完全暴露了美国企图进一步加强它在北大西洋集团中的支配地位的目的。英法原想用这个“合作”计划来限制美国，约束美国对英法利益进行乘火打劫的活动，但是这个要求遭到了杜勒斯的断然拒绝。他宣布美国将保留在“紧急情况”下不同它的伙伴们协商就可以采取单独行动的权利。这给了英法当头一棒。法国愤愤不平地责备说，美国“要求把国际上的清规戒律强加在盟国身上，而它自己却保留在这些清规戒律的范围以外行动的权利”。美国的伙伴们再一次看到，加强北大西洋集团究竟能够给他们带来什么利益。
    尽管如此，公报表明，英法仍然屈从了美国进一步迫使它的盟国加强陆、海、空三军兵力的要求。在过去七年中，北大西洋集团国家进行扩张军备已经花费了三千六百多亿美元，使英法和其他国家的财政经济陷于严重困难境地。英国财政大臣麦克米伦公开叫喊英国已再不能把这个沉重的担子继续挑下去了。但是，美国依然打算要拨出五亿多美元来强使它的盟国把兵力提高到“计划水平”。
    巴黎会议发出了一片叫嚷扩军、“原子报复”和抵制苏联裁军建议的喧嚣声。它们为了掩饰自己的继续扩军备战的活动，重弹所谓“苏联威胁”的滥调，并对匈牙利事件进行了歇斯底里的叫嚣。很显然，巴黎会议的势力集团正在竭力企图毒化国际气氛，转移人们对它们的新的扩军和侵略计划的注意力，制止紧张局势的缓和。
