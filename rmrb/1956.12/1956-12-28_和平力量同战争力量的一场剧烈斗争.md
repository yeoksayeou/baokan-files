    A Fierce Struggle Between Forces of Peace and Forces of War
    Gu Si
    I. The Significance of the Anglo-French Forced Withdrawal
    The Anglo-French armed aggression against Egypt has completely failed. The Anglo-French invading forces that once occupied Port Said have completely withdrawn, and the Israeli accomplice forces that invaded the Sinai Peninsula are also being forced to retreat.
    The heroic people of Port Said are jubilantly celebrating victory. After three months of political blackmail against Egypt over the Suez Canal issue, on October 29, Britain and France brazenly instigated Israel to launch a war, and using this as a pretext, issued an ultimatum to Egypt and launched a large-scale attack on Egypt. Britain and France mobilized 160,000 troops, deployed over a hundred warships, and dispatched over two thousand aircraft, attempting to coordinate with the Israeli accomplice forces' offensive to seize the entire canal area in one fell swoop, annihilate the main force of the Egyptian army, and overthrow the Egyptian national government. However, the Egyptian people, united as one, resolutely rose up to resist and shattered the invaders' operational plan to achieve a quick victory, inflicting heavy losses on the invaders. At the same time, Arab countries united in supporting Egypt. They took measures such as severing diplomatic relations with Britain and France, cutting off oil pipelines to Britain and France, banning oil exports to Britain and France, and even announcing their readiness to take joint action with Egypt to strike at the invaders. Throughout the Asia-Africa region and all socialist countries, powerful calls for support for Egypt and opposition to the invaders arose like a storm. Governments of various countries lodged protests with the British and French governments, and people everywhere held demonstrations, proposing to organize volunteer armies to support Egypt. The broad masses of people and forces for peace in Western Europe and the Americas also took action. Under the strong pressure of the people of various countries, the United Nations General Assembly, which had always been manipulated by the United States, Britain, and France, reversed its usual state and convened an emergency meeting on November 1, passing resolutions by an overwhelming majority demanding that the invaders immediately cease fire and withdraw their troops. Finally, the Soviet government, in accordance with the wishes of the world's people, issued a serious warning to the governments of Britain, France, and Israel on November 5, determined to restore peace by force, forcing the invaders to announce their acceptance of the ceasefire on November 6.
    After being forced to cease fire, the Anglo-French invaders once refused to withdraw their troops and continued to concentrate troops in Port Said, attempting to restart the war when the opportunity arose. However, under the strong pressure of the peace forces of various countries and the increasingly serious internal difficulties of the invaders, the British and French governments were finally forced to announce on December 3 that they would withdraw all their troops from Egypt without delay.
    The failure of the Anglo-French armed aggression against Egypt is first and foremost a great victory for the Egyptian people in resolutely opposing colonial war and safeguarding national sovereignty and independence. This victory proves that an awakened and independent heroic nation cannot be defeated. The era in which colonialists attempt to use the gunboat policy of the past to suppress the national independence movements of the Eastern countries is definitely gone forever. The Egyptian people, from this great victory, will further strengthen their courage and determination to safeguard national sovereignty and independence and freedom.
    The victory of the Egyptian people is also a major victory for the anti-colonial movement worldwide. The target of this Anglo-French armed attack on Egypt was not only Egypt. In fact, it was a presumptuous attempt by them to rebuild the colonial system in the East by armed means. In the words of Associated Press reporter Roberts, this was "the first step in a plan to restore the situation in the entire Middle East to what it was before World War II." Therefore, the people of Asia and Africa rose up in unison and repelled this rampant offensive by the colonialists. This result is a most powerful encouragement to the anti-colonial movements of people all over the world.
    At the same time, this struggle to stop the Anglo-French armed aggression against Egypt can also be seen as a major victory for the world's peace forces over the forces of war. Just as the international situation was easing, the Anglo-French aggressors completely disregarded the wishes of the world's people, brazenly blocked the path of international consultation, and attempted to use war to resolve international disputes. On the eve of launching the war of aggression against Egypt, the imperialists also took advantage of the situation in Hungary, instigating a fascist restoration conspiracy in Hungary, creating a serious situation of two-pronged attack on the world's peace forces. However, the peace forces of various countries demonstrated an unprecedentedly vast momentum and concerted action in the struggle to stop the Anglo-French armed aggression against Egypt. The basic situation in which the world's peace forces are greater than the forces of war is very clearly displayed. The result of this struggle will encourage the world's people to carry out the struggle to defend peace with greater confidence, thereby making it more difficult for imperialist war plans to be implemented.
    II. The Aggressors Reap What They Sow
    The purpose of Britain and France in launching this war was originally to show the remaining power of these two aging colonial empires, so that they could take the opportunity to suppress the national independence movements in the Middle East and North Africa and save the collapse of the colonial system. However, the result was completely beyond their expectations. Britain and France not only suffered a complete loss of moral reputation, nakedly revealing the ugly faces of colonialists, but also exposed their outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature in military and economic terms. The anti-British and anti-French colonialist sentiments of the people in the Middle East, North Africa, and the entire Asia-Africa region have become more intense. The foundations of the two colonial empires have become more shaky, and even once caused a crisis that threatened the disintegration of the British Commonwealth.
    The war of aggression against Egypt greatly promoted the economic crisis in Britain and France. Due to the interruption of shipping in the Suez Canal and the cutting off of oil pipelines in the Middle East, and due to the increase in military expenditures, Britain and France are now encountering a series of difficulties such as a serious oil shortage, financial difficulties, rising prices, reduced foreign trade, and declining reserves. Many important economic sectors have experienced shutdowns, production cuts, and increased unemployment due to insufficient raw materials and fuel. Britain has been forced to reinstate the oil rationing system implemented during World War II on December 17. The black market price of gasoline has doubled. The total reserves of the sterling area have been depleted by 12.4% in the month of November alone. The production of oil refining, steel, glass, cement, paper making, and other industrial sectors in France has been reduced. The British and French governments were forced to resort to the humiliating method of begging the United States for oil and dollars to tide over the difficulties. However, the United States took the opportunity to impose harsh extortion and suppression on Britain and France. The French newspaper "Les Echos" wrote: "Our economic independence is under threat. Military intervention in Egypt has frustrated our economic independence. In the future, we will be as dependent on the United States as we were in the post-war period, and it will use oil and dollars to control us."
    Under the weight of numerous difficulties, the political crisis in Britain and France has further deepened. The parliaments of the two countries are in turmoil both inside and outside. British Labour Party members of parliament have taken advantage of the situation to repeatedly propose impeachment motions against the Conservative government. The Conservative Party is also divided and full of complaints. This forced Eden to go to Jamaica for a while to avoid the storm. British newspapers are already discussing that the "end of the Eden government is not far away." The British Conservative newspaper "Daily Express" wrote that Britain is now in a state of
  "Trouble at home. More trouble abroad. Trouble in Parliament. Trouble in the Party. Lots of trouble." The adventure in Port Said "has left a sad legacy for Britain's power and prestige." The situation in France is no better than in Britain.
    At the same time, the contradictions within the imperialist camp have also intensified. Because the Anglo-French war of aggression against Egypt tarnished the reputation of the entire imperialist group and caused some of Britain and France's "allies" to suffer damage in shipping, trade, and other aspects, many "allies" blamed Britain and France for their adventure, while Britain and France complained that they were not helping enough. Especially between the United States and Britain and France, because the United States took advantage of the situation to intensify its pressure on Britain and France, this once caused a fierce public quarrel on both sides of the Atlantic. At the recent meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council in Paris, although the United States, Britain, and France tried to mend the cracks and conceal the contradictions, their infighting over the Middle East issue was still very acute. Dulles also publicly admitted after the meeting that there were "differences" between the United States, Britain, and France.
    III. The Two-Faced Policy of the Smiling Tiger
    On the Suez Canal issue, the United States has been playing a two-faced game. On the one hand, it has completely stood with Britain and France, adhered to the colonialist position, and encouraged Britain and France to embark on the path of adventure; on the other hand, it has verbally claimed to "respect" Egypt's sovereignty and has put on the appearance of a "peacemaker," attempting to be all things to all people and profit from both sides. After Britain and France launched the war and suffered defeat, the United States' approach became even more sinister. On the one hand, it sheltered Britain and France and colluded with Britain and France to pursue the goals that they had failed to achieve in the war; on the other hand, it used Britain and France as scapegoats to raise the profile of the United States, putting on the face of a smiling tiger in front of the people of the Middle East.
    The American ruling group is trying to make people believe that the United States has never supported the Anglo-French armed intervention and that it has "abandoned colonialism" and "fully supports" the strong desire of the people of the Middle East to strive for independence. This is completely self-deceiving nonsense.
    The United States has been in cahoots with Britain and France from the very beginning. None of the various political blackmail attempts by Britain and France to infringe upon Egypt's sovereignty has been without the participation of the United States. As soon as Egypt announced the recovery of the Suez Canal, the US official immediately frowned and slandered and vilified Egypt, and held talks with Britain and France in early August to jointly put pressure on Egypt. Later, the plans infringing on Egypt's sovereignty that were produced at the two London conferences, namely the so-called "Eighteen-Nation Plan" and the "Users' Association" plan, were all proposed by the United States. The former also got a foul name, "Dulles Plan".
    During the period of preparation for armed intervention by Britain and France, they also received encouragement and support from the United States in many ways. For example, Dulles said in a televised broadcast speech on September 23 that unless Egypt accepts the system of "international control" of the Suez Canal, "one cannot expect people to always demand that force not be used." This is a form of support. When Britain and France were dispatching troops to the Mediterranean, the United States also repeatedly increased its troops to the Mediterranean, supporting Britain and France, which were suffering from a shortage of troops. This is another form of support. The public opinion of Britain and France had long been concerned that once an adventure was launched, the oil supply of Britain and France would be problematic. At this time, the US government and US oil companies, in the name of preparing to "boycott" the Suez Canal, quickly established a special agency, expanded domestic oil production, and repaired "surplus oil tankers," formulating an "emergency plan" to supply oil to Western Europe. Dulles also publicly declared that loans could be given to Britain and France to purchase US oil. These measures by the United States played a great role in encouraging Britain and France, which had limited oil reserves, to dare to take risks.
    When Britain and France had already launched an offensive and world opinion unanimously demanded to stop the invaders, although the United States also outwardly played the role of demanding that Britain and France cease fire, its actual actions were to protect the invaders step by step. It announced that it prohibited the transportation of US military supplies to the Middle East region, including Egypt, but "did not interrupt" military assistance to Britain and France. At the same time, it also condoned the invaders' use of weapons supplied by the United States to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to slaughter the Egyptian people. Although Egypt had protested long ago, the United States did not stop it, and only issued a perfunctory protest to Britain and France after the ceasefire. In particular, when the Soviet Union proposed a proposal in the Security Council to take emergency measures to stop the invaders and suggested that the United States and the Soviet Union take joint action to restore peace in the Middle East, the true nature of the United States was further exposed. It immediately rejected the Soviet proposal and voted with Britain and France to obstruct the Security Council from taking action. Later, the United States even arrogantly shouted that it opposed any volunteer personnel supporting Egypt from entering the Middle East, and transferred a large number of US naval and air forces to the Mediterranean and Turkey, openly bolstering the courage of the invaders.
    The reason why the United States wants to support and shelter Britain and France in this way is because it is also a colonialist. Like Britain and France, it wants to take the Suez Canal as the property of the imperialists; it wants to seize more oil resources and colonial-style markets in the Middle East; it wants to turn the Middle Eastern countries into its own military bases and spheres of influence; it wants to destroy the national independence movement of the Middle Eastern people. The United States is not only the most greedy, most cunning, and most insidious colonialist, but also the main pillar of existing colonialism. Therefore, although it has differences with Britain and France in terms of aggression methods, and even uses methods of undermining Britain and France to achieve its own colonialist goals, it cannot hide its emotions of shared suffering with the British and French colonialists. US Vice President Nixon said in a foreign policy speech on December 6: "Our friends (referring to Britain and France) took action under serious provocation, and they were almost at the end of their rope. … We are proud of our ties with Britain and France, and proud of our … common determination." This completely tore off the olive branch mask that the United States had put on.
    So, why does the United States want to play a two-faced game? There are many complex reasons for this: one reason is that the US election was imminent when Britain and France launched their adventure, and the Republican government was touting "peace and prosperity" as the main slogan of the election, so it did not dare to easily participate in the adventure.
    Another reason is that the world's opposition to the invaders is very fierce, and it is more advantageous to follow world opinion, put on the guise of "peace," and carry out expansion activities in the future.
    Another reason is that there were inherent contradictions between the United States and Britain and France in their competition for colonial interests in the Middle East and their conspiracy to seize control of the Suez Canal. After the war, US monopoly capital's squeeze on British and French forces in the Middle East was very intense. After the Suez Canal issue occurred, the United States encouraged Britain and France to adopt an uncompromising and barbaric attitude and maintain a stalemate for a long time, making Britain and France's position in the Middle East increasingly weakened, while the United States took the opportunity to move in and replace them.
    The most fundamental reason is that the universal awakening and increasing strength of the people of the Middle Eastern countries make it impossible for the imperialist group to use the old colonialist methods. Therefore, the United States has to change its methods of aggression in order to more cleverly achieve the goal of expanding American influence. This is both conducive to its squeezing out Britain and France and convenient for it to confuse the people of the Middle Eastern countries. In the Asian countries of the Baghdad Pact, due to the strong anti-British sentiments of the broad masses of people, some countries have announced that they will no longer hold meetings with Britain. However, the United States took the opportunity to announce that it fully supports the Baghdad Pact, and has now completely controlled this military group. Now, some Middle Eastern countries are facing the danger of "rejecting the tiger at the front door and letting the wolf in at the back door."
    IV. The Struggle is Not Over Yet
    Now, although the Anglo-French war plan to invade Egypt has been shattered, a series of problems caused by this war—for example, the issue of the aggressors compensating for war losses, the issue of clearing the canal, the issue of the time limit for the withdrawal of the United Nations Emergency Force from Egypt—remain to be resolved. In addition, the Israeli government has also arrogantly clamored that Egypt will not be allowed to fully recover the Sinai Peninsula. Therefore, in order to solve these problems on the basis of fully respecting Egypt's sovereignty and rights, restoring the peaceful life of the Egyptian people, and restoring the shipping of the canal, there will be many complex struggles in the future.
    The conspiracy that the United States has laid out on the Suez Canal issue and the Middle East situation issue deserves special attention.
    On the canal issue, the United States' conspiratorial means include two steps. One step is to attempt to use the United Nations Emergency Force and use the work of clearing the canal to create a fait accompli of infringing on Egypt's sovereignty. The United States and some of its followers have sung the tune of making the United Nations Emergency Force "permanent" in the United Nations. This is clearly an attempt to use the name of the United Nations to achieve the goal of occupying the canal area that the Anglo-French forces failed to achieve. On the issue of clearing the canal, the United States is also playing tricks under the cover of the United Nations flag. Britain and France are now stubbornly insisting on participating in the work of clearing the canal, which exposes that the so-called "clearing the canal" has other purposes.
    Another step is to prepare to pressure Egypt again, through the United Nations General Assembly or other means, to accept "international control" of the canal. The US and British and French foreign ministers have reached an agreement in recent talks, insisting on making "canal management free from political influence" and realizing the "Eighteen-Nation Plan." The so-called "Eighteen-Nation Plan" (i.e., the "Dulles Plan") was originally rejected by Egypt long ago and vetoed by the Security Council. Indian Prime Minister Nehru once called it a "dead mackerel," but the United States, Britain, and France now want to bring the dead fish back to life.
    In the overall Middle East situation, the policy of the United States is to try to "fill" the "vacuum" caused by the failure of the Anglo-French colonial forces. At present, the United States is carrying out large-scale activities in the countries of the Baghdad Pact group. Nixon also mentioned in his foreign policy speech on December 6 that the United States wants to "resolve" the Israeli-Arab dispute, "limit" the Middle Eastern countries' armaments, and other plans. This is both to interfere in the internal affairs of the Arab countries and to unilaterally weaken the defense forces of the Arab countries. In the past few years, the United States, Britain, and France have been constantly provoking Israeli-Arab disputes and arming Israel to attack Egypt under the guise of "mediation" and "restriction."
    Nixon's speech also stated that the United States wants to give the Middle Eastern countries "generous assistance." The Arab countries have long tasted the taste of this "generosity" from the United States. The Aswan Dam incident is a well-known example. President Nasser said in a speech on December 10: "They linked the issue of assisting the construction of the Aswan Dam with conditions that could turn Egypt into a colony." Facts have proved that in many cases, the so-called "assistance" from the United States is even more poisonous than the gunboat policy of Britain and France.
    At the same time, the imperialists are releasing a large amount of anti-communist and anti-Soviet smoke in the Middle East to threaten countries such as Syria and create tension. When the invaders were forced to cease fire in Egypt, the United States, Britain, and France began to fabricate the myth of the so-called "Soviet infiltration" into the Middle East, and used this as an excuse to intimidate and threaten Syria, which firmly supported Egypt. The imperialists adopted this despicable means to divert world opinion's attention to the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, dilute the hatred of the people of the Middle East towards imperialism, and cover up the expansion of the United States in the Middle East; on the other hand, they attempted to use this to divide the unity of the Arab countries, create hostility among the Middle Eastern countries, and provoke their relations with socialist countries. The imperialists understand that only by destroying the unity of the world's peace forces can their aggression plans succeed.
    For the same reason, the United States and its followers have recently repeatedly proposed proposals in the United Nations to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs and slander the Soviet Union, clamoring loudly and making the United Nations a chaotic mess. This set of mutually responsive practices of the United States in the Middle East, in Hungary, and in the United Nations is to drag the already rotten "Cold War" out again to poison the international atmosphere in order to obstruct the easing of the international situation.
    Therefore, the Egyptian people, the people of the Middle Eastern countries, and the world's peace forces must also be vigilant, continue to struggle, frustrate the plan of the United States, Britain, and France to use the United Nations signboard to infringe on Egypt's sovereignty, frustrate their plan to continue to use Israel as a tool for provocation to interfere in the Middle East situation, and frustrate their plan to use "anti-communism" as a cover to carry out anti-peace activities in the Middle East.

### 和平力量同战争力量的一场剧烈斗争

    和平力量同战争力量的一场剧烈斗争
    顾思
    一、英法被迫撤兵的意义
    英法对埃及的武装侵略已经完全失败了。一度强占塞得港的英法侵略军已经全部撤退，侵入西奈半岛的以色列帮凶军也在被迫滚回去。
    英雄的塞得港人民正在欢欣鼓舞地庆祝胜利。英法两国在苏伊士运河问题上对埃及施行了三个月的政治讹诈之后，10月29日悍然唆使以色列发动战争，并以此为借口向埃及提出最后通牒，大举进攻埃及。英法两国动员了十六万兵员、出动了一百多艘军舰和两千多架次飞机，企图配合以色列帮凶军的攻势，一举攻占全部运河地区、歼灭埃及主力、推翻埃及民族政府。但是，埃及全国军民团结一致地奋起抗战，粉碎了侵略者企图速战速决的作战计划，并使侵略者蒙受沉重的损失。与此同时，阿拉伯各国团结一致地支援埃及。它们纷纷采取和英法绝交、截断英法的输油管、禁止向英法输出石油以至宣布准备和埃及采取联合行动等措施来打击侵略者。在整个亚非地区和所有社会主义国家，风起云涌地发出了支援埃及和反对侵略者的强大呼声。各国政府纷纷向英法政府提出抗议，人民群众到处举行游行示威，并且提出要组织志愿军去支援埃及。西欧和美洲各国的广大人民和主张和平的力量也行动起来了。英法国内也掀起了强大的反战运动。由于各国人民的强大压力，一向被美英法操纵的联合国大会也一反往常状态，在11月1日起召开紧急大会，以绝大多数票连续通过了要求侵略者立即停火和撤兵的决议。最后，苏联政府顺应世界人民的意愿，在11月5日向英、法、以色列政府提出了决心以武力恢复和平的严重警告，迫使侵略者在11月6日不得不宣布接受停火。
    在被迫停火之后，英法侵略者曾经一度拒不撤兵，并向塞得港继续集结军队，企图俟机重启战端。但是在各国和平力量的强大压力下，在侵略者内部困难日益严重的情况下，英法政府终于被迫在12月3日宣布毫不迟延地从埃及撤退全部军队。
    英法武装侵略埃及的失败，首先是埃及人民坚决地反对殖民战争、保卫民族主权和独立的伟大胜利。这一胜利证明一个觉醒了和独立了的英勇民族是不可被战胜的。殖民主义者企图用过去的炮舰政策来镇压东方各国人民的民族独立运动的时代，肯定地是已经一去不复返了。埃及人民从这一伟大胜利中，必将进一步地坚定自己的维护民族主权和独立自由的勇气和决心。
  埃及人民的胜利，也是全世界反殖民主义运动的一个重大的胜利。英法这次武装进攻埃及，目标不只是针对埃及的。这实际上是它们企图在东方采取武装手段来重建殖民主义制度的一个狂妄的尝试。用美联社记者罗伯茨的话来说，这是“打算在整个中东恢复第二次世界大战以前的情况的计划的第一步。”因此，亚非各国人民一致奋起，打退了殖民主义者这次猖獗的进攻。这个结果，对于世界各地人民的反殖民主义运动，都是一个最有力的鼓舞。
    同时，这次制止英法武装侵略埃及的斗争，同样可以看作是世界和平力量对战争力量的重大胜利。正当国际形势有所缓和的时候，英法侵略者却完全不顾世界人民的意愿，悍然堵塞国际协商的道路，企图使用战争的方法来解决国际纷争。在发动侵埃战争的前夕，帝国主义者还利用匈牙利局势，在匈牙利策动了法西斯复辟阴谋，造成对世界和平力量两路进攻的严重局势。但是，各国的和平力量在制止英法武装侵略埃及的斗争中，表现了空前浩大的声势和一致行动。世界和平力量大于战争力量的基本形势，十分鲜明地显示出来了。这次斗争的结果，将要推动世界人民更加充满信心地去进行保卫和平的斗争，从而使帝国主义的战争计划更难推行。
    二、侵略者自食其果
    英法两国这次发动战争，本来是想显示一下这两个衰老的殖民帝国的余威，以便它们乘势镇压中东、北非的民族独立运动，挽救殖民制度的崩溃。但是，结果完全出乎它们的意料之外。英法两国不但道义上声名扫地，赤裸裸地露出了殖民主义者的丑恶面目，而且军事上和经济上的外强中干的本相也暴露无余。中东、北非和整个亚非地区人民反对英法殖民者的情绪更加高涨。两个殖民帝国的基础更加动摇，甚至一度引起英联邦濒于瓦解的危机。
    侵埃战争大大地促进了英法国内的经济危机。由于苏伊士运河航运中断和中东油管被切断，由于军费开支的增大，英法两国现在都遭遇了严重的石油荒和财政短绌、物价上涨、对外贸易缩减、储备金下降等一系列的困难。许多重要经济部门因为原料、燃料不足，发生了停工减产和失业增加的现象。英国已被迫在12月17日开始恢复在第二次世界大战期间实行的石油配给制。汽油的黑市价格上涨了两倍。英镑地区的储备金总额在11月份一个月中就损耗了12.4％。法国的炼油、钢铁、玻璃、水泥、造纸等工业部门的生产都已削减。英法政府被迫以低声下气地向美国求乞石油和美元的办法来度过难关。而美国却乘机向英法施行苛刻的勒索和压制。法国“回声报”写道：“我们的经济独立处在威胁中。对埃及的军事干涉使我们的经济独立受到了挫折。今后我们将像战后时期一样紧紧地依赖美国，它将用石油和美元来控制我们。”
    在困难重重之下，英法国内的政治危机也进一步加深了。两国的议会内外都吵成一团。英国工党议员利用局势，一再提出了对保守党政府的弹劾案。保守党内部也意见分歧，怨声载道。这逼使艾登一度远走牙买加去避风头。英国报纸已在议论着：艾登政府的“末日不远了”。英国保守党的“每日快报”写道，英国现在是
  “国内有麻烦。国外麻烦更多。议会有麻烦。党有麻烦。麻烦很多”，塞得港的冒险，“给英国的力量和威信留下了可悲的后果”。法国的情况也不比英国好些。
    同时，帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾也加剧了。由于英法的侵埃战争搞臭了整个帝国主义集团的名声，并且使英法的一些
  “盟国”在航运、贸易等方面也受到损害。因此，许多“盟国”责怪英法的冒险，而英法则又埋怨它们帮忙不够。特别是美国和英法之间，由于美国利用局势加紧对英法进逼，这曾引起大西洋两岸一场激烈的公开的争吵。最近在巴黎举行的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议上，美英法三国虽然力图弥缝裂痕，掩饰矛盾，但是，它们在中东问题上的互相倾轧仍是十分尖锐。杜勒斯在会后也公开承认美英法之间存在着“分歧”。
    三、笑脸虎的两面政策
    在苏伊士运河问题上，美国一直玩弄两面手法。它一面同英法完全站在一道，坚持殖民主义立场，怂恿英法走上冒险的道路；另一面又在口头上说是要“尊重”埃及的主权，并且摆出“和事佬”的架子，企图左右逢源，两面渔利。英法发动了战争并遭遇失败之后，美国的做法更为阴险。它一面庇护英法，并伙同英法去追逐在战争中所未能达到的目的；另一面又把英法当替罪羊来抬高美国的身价，在中东人民面前装笑脸虎。
    美国统治集团力图使人相信：美国从来就不支持英法的武装干涉，而且它已经“放弃了殖民主义”，“完全支持”中东各国人民争取独立的强烈愿望。这完全是自欺欺人的鬼话。
    美国从一开始就是和英法一鼻孔出气的。英法企图侵犯埃及主权的各种政治讹诈，没有一项没有美国参与其事。埃及刚刚宣布收回苏伊士运河之后，美国官方马上就横眉怒目地诽谤和诬蔑埃及，并在8月初就同英法举行会谈，联合向埃及施加压力。以后在两次伦敦会议上搞出来的侵犯埃及主权的方案，即所谓“十八国计划”和“使用国协会”计划，都是美国带头提出来的。前者还得到了“杜勒斯计划”这样一个臭名称。
    英法在准备武装干涉的期间，也得到了美国多方面的鼓励和支持。例如，杜勒斯在9月23日发表的电视广播谈话中就说：除非埃及接受“国际管制”苏伊士运河的制度，“不能够期望老是要求人们不使用武力”。这是一种形式的支持。英法在向地中海调遣军队的时候，美国也一再向地中海增兵，为苦于兵力不足的英法撑腰。这是另一种形式的支持。英法两国的舆论早就耽心，一旦发动冒险，英法的石油供应会发生问题。这个时候，美国政府和美国石油公司就以准备“抵制”苏伊士运河为名，赶紧建立了一个专门机构，扩大国内石油生产和修理“剩余油船”，拟订好了一个供应西欧石油的“紧急计划”，杜勒斯还曾公开宣称可以给予英法贷款来购买美国石油。美国的这些措施，对于存油有限的英法敢于冒险，起了很大的鼓励作用。
    在英法已经发动进攻，世界舆论一致要求制止侵略者的时候，美国虽然在表面上也扮演了要求英法停火的姿态，可是它的实际行动却是步步袒护侵略者。它宣布：禁止美国军用物资运到包括埃及在内的中东地区去，可是“不中断”对英法的军事援助。同时，它也纵容侵略者使用美国供给北大西洋公约集团的武器来屠杀埃及人民，虽然埃及早就提出抗议，但美国不加制止，直到停火之后才向英法提一个假惺惺的抗议。特别是苏联在安理会提出采取紧急措施来制止侵略者的提案，并且建议美苏两国采取联合行动来恢复中东和平的时候，美国的本相就进一步暴露出来了。它立即拒绝了苏联的建议，并且同英法一道投票阻挠安理会采取行动。以后，美国更狂妄地叫喊它反对任何支援埃及的志愿人员进入中东，并且把大批美国海空军调到地中海和土耳其，公开地为侵略者壮胆。
    美国之所以要这样地支持和庇护英法，因为它同样是殖民主义者。它和英法一样，想把苏伊士运河据为帝国主义者所有；想要更多地在中东夺取石油资源和殖民地式的市场；想把中东国家变为自己的军事基地和势力范围；想要摧残中东人民的民族独立运动。美国不但是最贪馋、最狡猾、最阴险的殖民主义者，而且是现存的殖民主义的主要支柱。因此，它在侵略手段方面虽然与英法有分歧，甚至使用挖英法的墙脚的办法来达到自己的殖民主义目的，但是它无论如何也掩饰不了它对英法殖民者的同病相怜的情绪。美国副总统尼克松在12月6日发表的外交政策演说中就说：“我们的朋友（指英法）是在严重的挑衅下采取行动的，他们差不多已经到了忍无可忍的地步。……我们以我们同英国和法国的联系而骄傲，以我们……的共同决心而骄傲。”这就把美国披在身上的橄榄枝画皮完全撕掉了。
    那末，为什么美国要玩弄两面手法呢？这有许多复杂的原因：一个原因是英法发动冒险时美国大选在即，共和党政府是标榜“和平与繁荣”为竞选的主要口号的，因此不敢轻易参加冒险。
    另一个原因是全世界对侵略者的反对十分激烈，不如顺着世界舆论，插上要“和平”的幌子，对今后进行扩张活动更为有利。
    再一个原因是美国同英法在角逐中东的殖民利益和共谋夺取苏伊士运河控制权的过程中，本来就存在着矛盾。战后，美国垄断资本在中东排挤英法势力非常剧烈。苏伊士运河问题发生后，美国又鼓励英法采取不妥协的横蛮态度，长期僵持，使得英法在中东的地位日益削弱，而美国却乘机活动，取而代之。
    还有一个最根本的原因是中东各国人民的普遍觉醒和力量日益强大，帝国主义集团使用老一套的殖民主义办法已经行不通了。因此，美国不得不改变侵略的方式，以便更巧妙地达到扩张美国势力的目的。这既有利于它排挤英法，也便于它迷惑中东各国人民。在巴格达条约的亚洲国家内，由于广大人民反英情绪强烈，有些国家已宣布不再同英国在一道举行会议。但是，美国就乘机宣布它完全支持巴格达条约，现在实际上已经完全控制了这个军事集团。现在某些中东国家已面临“前门拒虎、后门进狼”的危险。
    四、斗争还没有结束
    现在，英法侵略埃及的战争计划虽然已被打破，但是这个战争所引起的一系列问题——例如，侵略者赔偿战争损失的问题，清理运河的问题，联合国紧急部队撤出埃及的期限问题——尚待解决。另外，以色列政府还曾狂妄地叫嚣不让埃及完全收复西奈半岛。因此，为了在充分尊重埃及的主权和权利的基础上解决这些问题，恢复埃及人民的和平生活和恢复运河的航运，今后还有许多复杂的斗争。
    美国在苏伊士运河问题和中东局势问题上布置的阴谋特别值得人们重视。
    在运河问题上，美国的阴谋手段包括两个步骤。一个步骤是企图利用联合国紧急部队和利用清理运河的工作，造成侵犯埃及主权的既成事实。美国和它的某些追随者已在联合国唱出了要使联合国紧急部队“永久化”的论调。这显然是想利用联合国名义来达到英法军队所未能达到的占领运河地区的目的。在清理运河问题上，美国也在联合国旗帜掩护下耍花招。英法两国现在死赖着硬要参加清理运河的工作，这就暴露了所谓“清理运河”是另有目的的。
    另一个步骤是准备通过联合国大会或其他方式，再度压迫埃及接受对运河的“国际管制”。美国同英法外长在最近的会谈中已达成了协议，坚持要使“运河管理摆脱政治影响”，实现“十八国计划”。所谓“十八国计划”（即“杜勒斯计划”），本来是早就被埃及拒绝、又被安理会否决了的。印度尼赫鲁总理曾把它称为“死鲭鱼”，但美英法现在还想让死鱼复活。
    在整个中东局势方面，美国的政策是力图“填补”英法殖民势力失败所引起的“真空”。目前美国正在巴格达条约集团国家中大肆活动。尼克松在12月6日的外交政策演说中还提到了美国要“解决”以色列—阿拉伯纠纷、“限制”中东国家的军备等打算。这既是为了干涉阿拉伯国家的内政，也是为了片面地削弱阿拉伯国家的国防力量。在过去几年中，美英法早就是在“调解”、“限制”等幌子的掩盖下，不断挑拨以阿纷争，并且武装起以色列来进攻埃及的。
    尼克松的演说中还提出，美国要给中东国家“慷慨的援助”。阿拉伯国家早就领略过美国这种“慷慨”的滋味了。阿斯旺水坝事件就是人所熟知的例子。纳赛尔总统在12月10日的演说中说：“他们把援助阿斯旺水坝建设工作的问题同一些能够使埃及沦为殖民地的条件联系在一起。”事实证明，在许多场合下，美国的所谓“援助”甚至比英法的炮舰政策更为恶毒。
    与此同时，帝国主义者正在中东大放反共、反苏的烟幕，以威胁叙利亚等国和制造紧张局势。侵略者在埃及被迫停火的时候，美英法三国就开始编造所谓“苏联渗入”中东的神话，并且以此为借口，对坚决支持埃及的叙利亚进行恫吓和威胁。帝国主义者采取这种卑鄙的手段，一方面是想要转移世界舆论对英法侵埃问题的注意力，冲淡中东人民对帝国主义的憎恨，以掩护美国在中东进行扩张；另一方面是企图借此来分化阿拉伯国家的团结、在中东国家中造成敌视，并且挑拨它们和社会主义国家的关系。帝国主义者懂得：只有破坏了世界和平力量的团结，它们的侵略计划才有可能得逞。
    出于同样的缘故，美国和它的追随者最近在联合国内也一而再、再而三地提出干涉匈牙利内政和诽谤苏联的提案，大吵大嚷，把联合国闹得乌烟瘴气。美国在中东、在匈牙利和在联合国的这一套互相呼应的做法，都是把已经腐烂了的“冷战”再度搬出来毒化国际气氛，以便阻挠国际局势的缓和。
    因此，埃及人民、中东各国人民和世界和平力量还必须提高警惕、继续斗争，挫败美英法企图利用联合国招牌来侵犯埃及主权的计划，挫败它们继续利用以色列做挑衅工具来干涉中东局势的计划，挫败它们用“反共”做幌子在中东进行反和平活动的计划。
