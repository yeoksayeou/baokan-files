　　Enterprises Should Have a Certain Degree of Autonomy
　　Gao Shangquan
    Allowing enterprises a certain degree of autonomy to leverage their initiative and overcome bureaucracy is a pressing issue that needs to be resolved.
    What are the drawbacks of factories having too little autonomy and central authorities exercising too much and too detailed centralized control?
    First, it causes a great waste of manpower and resources for the state. Because the central authorities control too much and too minutely, enterprises have to seek instructions from relevant central departments for many things, even for minor matters such as building a toilet or buying a typewriter. The general ways to request instructions or ask the higher authorities to solve problems are: 1. Sending someone to Beijing; 2. Writing official documents; 3. Sending telegrams; 4. Making phone calls.
    Looking first at enterprises sending people to seek instructions, the First Ministry of Machine Building, for example, has more than a thousand people from various enterprises coming to Beijing every day. According to the statistics of October 23, the number of enterprise personnel staying in the ministry's guesthouse on that day reached 1,444, with the Xi'an Instrument Factory having the most, with 99 people; the Luoyang Tractor Factory was second, with 54 people; it is most common for general enterprises to send four to eight people. It is said that during normal times, the guesthouse accommodates a maximum of more than 1,500 people per day, and a minimum of more than 1,200 people. Almost every enterprise has stationed personnel in Beijing. After these comrades arrive in Beijing, they usually have to go through several "gates" to complete their tasks, the most having to go through "nine gates", namely "four gates" in the bureau (clerk - section chief - division chief - bureau chief), and "five gates" in the ministry (clerk - section chief - division chief - director general - minister). They generally reflect: coming to Beijing to do business is more difficult than Guan Yu crossing five passes. According to the comrades in the guesthouse: after the comrades from the enterprises arrive in Beijing, they usually stay for at least one or two weeks, and up to ten months at most. One factory director said that the people from the factory who come to Beijing have figured out an "experience", that is, after getting off the train in Beijing, the primary task is to buy a "Beijing Daily", first looking at where they can watch operas, where they can have fun, and where there are exhibitions. They think that anyway, the authorities won’t deal with matters so quickly, so why not "watch" and "play" for a few days.
    Looking at writing official documents, sending telegrams, and making phone calls, the First Ministry of Machine Building (excluding bureaus and academies) receives and sends more than 30,000 official documents every month. According to statistics, a total of 33,006 official documents and 2,042 telegrams were received and sent in August.
    The central government also requires too many and too detailed statistical reports from enterprises. For example, enterprise equipment must be statistically reported unit by unit. Therefore, not only are there many reports, but they are also very thick when submitted. The statistical reports of the Second Machine Industry Administration Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building alone weighed eight tons in 1956. Comrades in the enterprises raised such a question: after the reports are submitted, does anyone actually read them? Who will read these reports?
    The above-mentioned examples are just some that can be directly seen, and even more serious is that they expand the organizational structure layer by layer and increase the number of staff. Because enterprises have limited authority, many things have to be requested and resolved by sending people, writing official documents, sending telegrams, and making phone calls. No matter which method is used, it requires people to do it. For example, writing official documents requires drafting, consulting, reviewing, typing, and receiving and sending; sending people requires several people to come, and the factory director has to bring section chiefs, engineers, or clerks. After arriving in Beijing, someone has to entertain them, and the guesthouse of the First Ministry of Machine Building alone has more than 150 staff members. In short, not only do enterprises need people to handle these things, but central authorities such as bureaus, ministries, and commissions also need to increase the number of staff accordingly. Thus, the phenomenon of "the larger the organization, the more staff" is formed. Moreover, there is very little effective work, just like a section chief of the First Machine Industry Administration Bureau said: "We run errands and argue for these things all day long." Obviously, if enterprises have a certain degree of autonomy, some things would not need to send people, write official documents, send telegrams, and make phone calls. The number of people in the factory can be reduced, and the central agencies and personnel can also be greatly streamlined.
    Second, it restricts the initiative and enthusiasm of enterprises, and potential cannot be fully realized. Taking financial management as an example, the factory director only has 500 yuan of discretionary power, and cannot make decisions if it exceeds 500 yuan. All of the enterprise's profits must be turned over, and a portion cannot be retained for the enterprise to dispose of itself. This means that the relationship between employees and the enterprise's management, cost reduction, and profitability is not very close, so it is impossible for them to be very concerned about it. If it is stipulated that a certain percentage of the enterprise's profits be retained for the enterprise itself for expanding reproduction and improving employee welfare, there will be a material force to motivate everyone to care about the enterprise's management, to be careful and thrifty, and to reduce costs. Mass management and supervision will be realized naturally. This is beneficial to the country, the enterprise, and the employees.
    Giving enterprises a certain degree of autonomy also increases their sense of responsibility, which will encourage them to more actively seek solutions to problems in their work. At present, because the central agencies control too much and too minutely, some enterprises often think that anyway, we have no way, and the difficult problems can only be submitted to the higher authorities for resolution, thus fostering a mentality of dependency to a certain extent.
    Third, it fosters bureaucracy, red tape, and preoccupation with routine matters in central agencies. Can central agencies manage well if they control too much and too minutely? Facts have proved that if you manage everything, you will not be able to manage anything well, and you cannot manage it. Instead, it breeds bureaucracy, red tape, and preoccupation with routine matters. Because leaders such as ministers, directors, director generals, and bureau chiefs are very busy. If you walk into their offices, you will indeed feel that they are busy enough. The telephone rings constantly, people are constantly looking for them, official documents and telegrams come in one after another, and meetings are held one after another. They rarely have time to consider problems, and many things can only be managed by comrades who do specific work (for example, the basic construction plan of the First Ministry of Machine Building is managed by the planning department of the ministry's construction company, and in fact, one person in the department manages the plans of one bureau and its subordinate factories). Comrades in the enterprises are afraid of this kind of "junior manager" approach, believing that these comrades often do not consider the opinions from below very well. The "juniors" also have their troubles, because they cannot make decisions, and often say: "This is just my personal opinion." Sometimes, the bureau's opinion is rejected by the ministry; the minister agrees, but the comrade in charge of specific work disagrees; the ministry's opinion is rejected by the State Planning Commission, the State Economic Commission, or the State Construction Commission. Therefore, it makes the enterprises feel difficult to do things, and they do not know who to listen to.
    Conversely, if the central agencies manage more general and major issues, and let enterprises make their own decisions on general issues, the leading agencies will not fall into bureaucracy, red tape, and preoccupation with routine matters.
    In order to improve the above situation, under the unified plan of the state, the following aspects of enterprises' powers are worth considering and studying: such as in technical management, enterprises should have the right to adopt new technologies and develop new varieties. Within a certain range, enterprises can make their own decisions on technical measures and adding new equipment, without central approval; in planning management, enterprises should have the right to modify quarterly and monthly plans under the premise of ensuring the completion of the annual plan, and make adjustments and balance them according to the circumstances; in financial management, enterprises should have a certain right to distribute profits to improve the living welfare of employees and encourage their enthusiasm for production; in terms of personnel organization management, enterprises should have a certain authority to recruit and use personnel, use personnel according to local conditions, or set up necessary organizational structures, and the central government may not make rigid regulations; in terms of external relations, enterprises should have the right to establish cooperative relations with the outside world and fix supply and sales relationships. This is very important. For example, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant cannot establish fixed supply and demand relationships with the outside world, and can only rely on the state to balance them regularly or temporarily. Therefore, the automatic machine steel needed by this plant is balanced to be supplied by Chongqing, and the freight per ton is as high as 68 yuan. If this plant directly establishes a supply and demand relationship with the Benxi Iron and Steel Plant, the freight per ton will only be 12 yuan.
    In short, under the unified plan of the state, allowing enterprises a certain degree of autonomy is an important measure to streamline state agencies, save expenses, increase the enthusiasm of enterprises, and overcome bureaucracy, red tape, and preoccupation with routine matters.

　　企业要有一定的自治权
　　高尚全
    让企业有一定的自治权，以发挥企业的积极性和克服官僚主义，是当前迫切需要解决的一个严重问题。
    厂里自治权过小，中央主管机关集权过多、过细，到底有什么弊端呢？
    第一、给国家造成很大的人力、财力的浪费。由于中央主管机关管得太多、太细，企业的许多事情都要请示中央有关部门，即使是很小的事情，如盖一个厕所或买一架打字机也不例外。一般请示或要求上级解决问题的方式有：一、派专人来京；二、写公文；三、发电报；四、打电话。
    先从企业派专人请示来看，以第一机械工业部为例，各企业派到北京来办事的人，每天有一千人以上。据10月23日的统计，这一天住在部内招待所的企业人员达一千四百四十四人，其中以西安仪表厂最多，有九十九人；洛阳拖拉机厂次之，有五十四人；一般企业派四人至八人最为普遍。据说在平时招待所最多每天住一千五百多人，最少也有一千二百人以上。几乎每个企业都派有专人常驻北京。这些同志来到北京后，一般要经过好几“关”才能把事办完，最多的要经过
  “九关”，即局里“四关”（科员—科长—处长—局长），部里“五关”（科员—科长—处长—司长—部长）。他们普遍反映：来北京办事要比关云长“过五关”还难。据招待所的同志说：企业里的同志一般来北京后，最少要住上一、二个星期，最多的达十个月。一位厂长说，厂里来北京办事的人都摸索到了一条“经验”，就是到北京下火车后，首要任务是买一张北京日报，先瞧那里可以看戏，那里可以玩，那里有展览会。他们认为反正上面办事不会那么快，“看”
  “玩”几天，何乐而不为呢。
    再从写公文、发电报、打电话来看，第一机械工业部（不包括局、院）每月收、发的公文达三万件以上，据统计，8月份共收发公文三万三千零六件，电报二千零四十二件。
    中央对企业要的统计报表也太多、太细，例如企业的设备要逐台统计上报。因此不仅造成报表多，而且报上来就是一大本。仅第一机械部第二机器工业管理局1956年的统计报表就重达八吨。企业里的同志提出这样的一个疑问：报上来后，到底有人看吗？谁来看这些报表呢？
    上面所举的例子只是可以直接看到的一些，而更严重的是：层层扩大了组织机构，增加了人员编制。由于企业的权限小，许多事情都要通过派专人、写公文、发电报，以及打电话等方式来请示解决。不管那一种方式都需要人来做。例如，写公文就要拟稿、会稿、审核、打字和收发；派专人，一来就要几个人，厂长来了要带科长、工程师或科员。到北京来后，就要有人招待，仅第一机械工业部的招待所就有一百五十多个工作人员。总之，这些事不仅企业要有人办，而且局、部、委员会等中央机关也要相应地增加人员编制。于是就形成了“机构越整越大，人员编制越编越多”的现象。而且有效劳动很少，正像第一机器工业管理局的一位科长说：“我们整天就为这些事跑腿、扯皮”。显然，如果企业有一定的自治权后，有些事情就可以不必派专人了，也不写公文、发电报和打电话了，厂里的人就可以减少，中央的机构和人员也可以大大的紧缩。
    第二、限制了企业的积极性和主动性，潜力不能充分发挥。拿财务管理来说，厂长只有五百元的机动权，超过了五百元就不能作主。企业的利润要全部上缴，不能留出一部分由企业自己支配。这就是说，职工跟企业的经营管理、降低成本及盈利的关系并不是十分密切的，因此也不可能对它感到十分关心。如果规定企业利润留出一定的百分比给企业自己作扩大再生产和改善职工福利之用，这样就有一种物质力量促使职工人人都关心企业的经营管理，精打细算，降低成本，群众性的管理和监督就会很自然地实现。这对国家、对企业、对职工都有好处。
    给企业一定的自治权，也就加重了企业的责任感，会促使企业更主动更积极地设法解决工作中的问题。目前由于中央机构管得太多、太细，有些企业往往认为反正我们没有办法，困难问题只好提请上级解决，因而在一定程度上养成了依赖思想。
    第三、助长了中央机关的官僚主义、文牍主义和事务主义。中央机关管得太多、太细，能否管好呢？事实证明，什么事都管，什么事也不容易管好，而且也管不了，反而滋长了官僚主义、文牍主义和事务主义。因为部长、主任、司长、局长等领导同志都很忙，如果走进他们的办公室就会确实感到他们是够忙的，电话铃不断地响，来人不断地找，公文电报源源而来，会议一个接一个地开着，他们很少有时间来考虑问题，而且许多事情也只有靠做具体工作的同志来管（如第一机械工业部基本建设计划是由该部基建公司计划处管的，实际是处里一个人管一个局及其所属各厂的计划）。企业里的同志都怕这种“小二当家”的作法，认为这些同志对下面的意见往往不很好考虑。“小二”们也有苦恼，因为他们当不了家，常常说：“这只是我个人的意见。”有时候，局里的意见给部里否定了；部长同意了，管具体工作的同志不同意；部里的意见又给计委、经委或建委否定了。因此，使企业觉得不好办事，不知听谁的好。
    反过来看，如果中央机关多管一些原则性及较大的问题，一般性的问题让企业自己作主去解决，领导机关就不致陷于官僚主义、文牍主义和事务主义里了。
    为改进上述情况，在国家统一计划下，下列几方面企业的权力是值得考虑和研究的：如在技术管理方面，让企业有权采用新技术，发展新品种，在一定范围内企业的技术措施及增添新设备可由企业自己作主，不必经中央批准；在计划管理方面，让企业在保证完成年度计划下，有权修改季、月度计划，因时制宜地加以调剂平衡；在财务管理方面，让企业有一定的利润分配权，以提高职工的生活福利，鼓励职工的生产积极性；在人员组织管理方面，让企业有一定的权限招聘和使用人员，因地制宜地使用人员或设立必要的组织机构，中央可不作硬性的规定；在对外关系方面，让企业有权同外界建立协作关系，固定供销关系。这一点是非常重要的。如第一汽车制造厂的不能同外界建立固定的供需关系，只能靠国家定期或临时平衡，因此这个厂需要的自动机钢被平衡到由重庆供应，每吨运费达六十八元，如这个厂直接同本溪钢厂建立供需关系，每吨运费只需十二元。
    总之，在国家统一计划下，让企业有一定的自治权，是精简国家机构、节约开支、提高企业积极性和克服官僚主义、文牍主义、事务主义的重要措施。
