Editor's Note:

    Don't Be a Prisoner of False Reports
    Reading reports is one of the ways for leading cadres to understand the situation. It has advantages: it is simple and saves time. It also has disadvantages: because some reports do not reflect the real situation, leading cadres will be fooled if they blindly believe them. The report from Wuwei County, Anhui Province, to the Provincial Party Committee is a typical example of not reflecting the real situation at all. Fortunately, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee did not blindly believe it, and as a result, they did the right thing, discovered the problem, promoted the work, and educated the cadres. Unfortunately, some leading cadres often covet the convenience of reading reports and regard it as the main, or even the only, way to grasp the situation and guide the work. They don't go down themselves, nor do they send people down, and they don't pay attention to the reflections from the masses. These comrades are bound to be prisoners of false reports.

    不要做假报告的俘虏
    看报告是领导干部掌握情况的办法之一。它有好处：简便省事；它也有坏处：因为有的报告并不能反映真实情况，领导干部如果一味相信就会上当。安徽无为县向省委的报告就是根本不反映真实情况的典型。好在安徽省委并没有一味相信，结果作对了，发现了问题，推动了工作，教育了干部。可惜，有些领导干部往往贪图看报告简便省事，就把它当成掌握情况指导工作的主要的办法，甚至唯一的办法，自己不下去，也不派人下去，对于来自群众的反映也不注意。这些同志就难免要做假报告的俘虏。
