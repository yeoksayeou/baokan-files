Impressions of Yangon
By Hu Qi, Our Correspondent

Yangon boasts a beautiful natural environment. Situated at the tail end of the low-lying Bago Yoma mountains, the city's outskirts are marked by rolling hills. Numerous lakes dot the landscape. Among them, "Great Lake" and "Swan Lake" offer picturesque views with their broad surfaces and lush, tree-lined shores. Burmese youths are often seen engaging in rowing activities on the lakes. The boats are narrow, accommodating only one person, yet they extend to a length of over twenty feet, navigated by six or seven individuals who move in unison, gliding across the water with remarkable speed.

Like any tropical city, Yangon is blessed with evergreen vegetation. Amidst the blue skies and verdant trees, the numerous pagodas, both gilded and of white stone, stand out with their brightness and grandeur. The gilded pagodas, reflecting the sunlight, emit a dazzling radiance, a unique characteristic of Yangon. The most famous, the Shwedagon Pagoda, stands atop a small hill, the highest point in Yangon, visible from afar throughout the city. Initially built two thousand five hundred years ago, it has been renovated and expanded by successive dynasties, resulting in its current structure. The pagoda's base measures over 1,400 feet in circumference, and it stands over 300 feet tall, entirely gilded. Legend has it that over two thousand five hundred years ago, two Burmese merchants encountered the Buddha in India, who gifted them eight strands of his own hair. They brought these sacred hairs back to Burma and presented them to King Okkalapa, who then ruled the area around present-day Yangon. King Okkalapa selected this small hill based on its auspicious feng shui, buried the sacred hairs at the hilltop, and built the first golden pagoda upon them. Outside this golden pagoda, silver, tin, copper, and lead pagodas were successively added, followed by a layer of marble, and finally enclosed by a brick pagoda. Later dynasties gilded it. It is impossible to ascertain exactly how much gold was required to gild such a large pagoda. However, one account states that in the fifteenth century, King Dhammazedi used gold equivalent to four times his and his queen's weight to renovate the pagoda. The pagoda is still renovated every three years, though not necessarily with such an amount of gold each time, but the expense is still considerable. The spire of the pagoda is adorned with numerous pearls and gemstones, which sparkle and gleam when viewed from below. This was a gift from King Mindon in 1871, and its cost at the time was said to be worth £62,000. Surrounding the main pagoda is a marble-paved platform, where emperors and wealthy individuals throughout history have built hundreds of pagodas and shrines of varying sizes, encircling the Shwedagon Pagoda. Besides the gilding, there are also many exquisite wood and stone carvings.

Burma is a Buddhist country, and most of the population, from the president to the common people, are devout Buddhists. Although Burma was under British rule for a long period in the past one or two hundred years, Western religions did not make much headway here. Currently, 80% of the people in Burma are still Buddhists. In the Shwedagon Pagoda and other large pagodas, there is a constant stream of pious men and women prostrating themselves before the Buddha statues in sincere worship.

On the streets of Yangon, there are many monks walking back and forth wearing yellow robes. Every morning, they carry their alms bowls and go to various homes to beg for food, where food is specially prepared for them. Sometimes they form a line, led by two people carrying a bronze chime, striking it as they walk. Pious Buddhists believe that offering alms is a sacred duty. It is estimated that there are about 200,000 monks in Burma. In addition to lifelong monks, every young Buddhist must become a monk for a period of time. Ordaining one's child is a solemn ceremony in Burma.

The Burmese people are peaceful, hardworking, cheerful, and optimistic. The Second World War caused serious damage to Burma, and it has not yet fully recovered. Years of civil war have also consumed a large amount of the country's wealth and energy. Therefore, the desire for peace and opposition to war are the most common and strong aspirations of the Burmese people. It is no accident that Burma has become one of the founding countries of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In 1952, at the initiative of U Nu, who was then the Prime Minister, a pagoda was built outside the city to pray for world peace. It is called the Peace Pagoda and is one of Yangon's famous attractions, visited by hundreds of people every day to pay their respects and admire it. What the Burmese people are now asking for is to end the ongoing civil war as soon as possible so that the country can concentrate on the road to reconstruction.

The lives of ordinary working people are still quite hard. Right along the roads, you can see them living in narrow wooden houses or sheds, eating simple food. The Burmese government has implemented some welfare measures in economic, cultural, and health aspects, including free medical care and paid holidays, which help to improve the lives of working people. However, there is still a long way to go to significantly improve the overall level of economic life.

Due to the repeated battles between the Japanese and British and Allied forces in the Second World War, Yangon suffered particularly severe damage. The port of Yangon, which before the war could handle more than three million tons of cargo annually, had its entire seven-mile-long dock line destroyed by artillery fire. The harbor was filled with sunken ships and wrecked equipment. After several years of clearing and reconstruction, it has now been restored to accommodate large ships of 15,000 tons and can handle more than 1.5 million tons of cargo per year.

Thanks to the vigorous expansion and reconstruction of the gasoline industry, Burma is now almost self-sufficient in gasoline. Burma's transportation industry has also seen great development. A huge airport, newly built in 1952 in Mingaladon, a dozen miles from the city center, has two runways over 8,000 feet long, capable of accommodating the largest jet aircraft, and is one of the few modern airports in the East. From here, you can take the national airline to about 40 towns and cities across the country. This company, along with the railway bureau, the shipping bureau, and the inland river transport company, are the main enterprises operated exclusively by the Burmese government in accordance with the constitutional provisions on nationalization, and they have all made considerable progress in the past few years.

According to the "Welfare Plan" formulated by the Burmese government, the goal is to achieve complete self-sufficiency in agricultural products in a period of several years; and several hundred million kyats will be invested in the development of industrial, mining, and power enterprises to increase the gross national product to 7 billion kyats (compared to 5.5 billion kyats before the war). With the help of the Soviet Union, China, and other countries, some new factories are being built.

Literate people account for 60% of the population in Burma. This may be beyond the expectations of foreign visitors. On the one hand, this is due to the tradition of the temple system, where young people receive basic literacy education while being ordained and studying scriptures. On the other hand, the government has indeed made considerable efforts in popularizing education since independence. In terms of higher education, the University of Yangon is the highest institution of learning in the country. It has a spacious campus located on the tranquil shores of Inya Lake. Currently, it has 9,000 students, compared to only 1,500 before independence.

Today's Burma is full of new atmosphere, which is unique to the people who have gained independence and freedom from colonial enslavement. The people of Yangon and other parts of Burma are preparing for their festive holiday - Independence Day. After a long and heroic struggle, the Burmese people finally forced British imperialism to recognize the right of the Burmese nation to independence more than eight years ago. January 4, 1948, was declared the national independence day. In the square garden in the center of Yangon, there stands a solemn stone monument over a hundred feet high, which was built to commemorate the independence of the Burmese nation. It is the glory and pride of the Burmese people. When talking about independence, there is one thing that makes the Burmese people feel painful: on the eve of independence, the leader of the Burmese national independence movement, General Aung San, whom they supported, and several of his comrades were assassinated by the enemy. In the northwest direction of the Shwedagon Pagoda, a simple house covers a row of nine white tombs, which is where General Aung San and his comrades are buried. To commemorate his contribution to the independence of the Burmese nation, a park named after Aung San has been opened on the edge of the Great Lake. At the entrance of the park, there stands a bronze statue of General Aung San. On these warm and sunny days, there are many people who come to this place to play. The statue of Aung San reminds them of the memories of the struggle for independence. (Attached picture)

    仰光印象
    本报记者　胡骑
    仰光有着美丽的自然环境。它位在低矮的庇固山脉的末端，出市区就是起伏的丘陵。这里的湖泊很多。其中“大湖”和“燕子湖”湖面宽阔，衬着树木茂盛的岸边，景色宜人。湖上常有缅甸青年作划船运动。船身很窄，只容一座，而长及二丈，六、七人驾着，同时动作，在湖上行走如飞。
    像任何热带的城市一样，四季常青的草木是仰光的天赋。在蓝天和绿树之间，大大小小的佛塔，有镀金的也有白石的，显得格外明亮而堂皇。镀金的佛塔，经阳光一照，发出灿烂的光辉，是仰光特有的景色。最出名的大金塔，矗立在一座小山上，居仰光的最高处，在全市的各处，远远的就可以望见。塔初建于二千五百年前，经历代王朝的修葺和增建，形成了目前的格局。塔底座周围一千四百余呎，高三百多呎，整体镀金。据传说在二千五百多年以前，两个缅甸人到印度经商，碰到了佛祖，佛祖送给了他们八根自己的头发。他们把这些圣发带回缅甸，献给了当时统治着现今仰光一带地方的阿茄塔王。阿茄塔王选定了这座小山的风水，把圣发埋在山顶地方，并在其上建造了最初的一座金塔。在这座金塔外面，又顺次配以银塔、锡塔、铜塔、铅塔，然后是一层大理石，最后才围成砖塔。后来的王朝把它镀上了金。究竟镀这样一座大塔需要多少金子，无从查考。但有一个材料说，十五世纪的达马塞蒂王为这座塔作了一次修饰，用了相当于他自己和他王后体重四倍的金子。现在这座塔还是每三年要修饰一次，当然不是每次要如许金子，但所费也可想而知了。塔顶是许多珍珠宝石镶成的，从底下望上去，可以看到闪烁发光。这是1871年时敏东王的献礼，据说当时的造价就值六万二千镑。在主塔的四周，是一片大理石铺成的平台，历代的帝王和有钱人在这里建了几百座大小不等的宝塔和佛座，把大金塔团团围住，除镀金以外，还有许多木石雕刻，十分精致。
    缅甸是一个佛教国，上自总统，下至普通百姓，大部分都是虔诚的佛教徒。过去一二百年间，缅甸虽长期受英国统治，但西方的宗教却在这里并无多大开展，目前缅甸80％的人还是信佛的。在大金塔和其他大佛塔里，成天有络绎不绝的善男信女，匍伏在佛像前专诚礼拜。
    仰光街上，来来往往，有不少披着黄色袈裟的和尚。每天早晨，他们就托着钵子，到各家去化缘，在那里有特为他们准备的饭食。有时他们排成队，前面由两人抬着一块铜磬，敲打着带引而走。虔诚的佛教徒认为这种供养是一件神圣的义务。据估计，全缅甸的和尚约在二十万之谱。除了终身的和尚，每一个佛教的年青人都要当一个时期的和尚，送自己的孩子受戒在缅甸是一种隆重的仪式。
    缅甸人民是和平勤劳、愉快乐观的。第二次大战使缅甸遭到了严重的破坏，直到现在还没有完全恢复。连年的内战又消耗国家的大量财富和精力。所以要求和平，反对战争是缅甸人民最普遍和强烈的愿望。缅甸成为和平共处五项原则首创国之一，并不是偶然的。1952年，经当时任总理的吴努先生倡议，在市外建了一座佛塔，祝祷世界和平，被称为和平塔，是仰光名胜之一，每天到那里朝拜和瞻仰的人数以百计。缅甸人民现在所要求的是尽速结束还在继续的内战。使国家能够集中精力走上重建的道路。
    普通劳动人民的生活还是相当清苦的。就在道路的两旁，你可以看到他们住在窄小的木板房子或是席棚里面，吃着简单的食物。缅甸政府在经济、文化、卫生各方面实行了一些福利措施：包括免费的医疗，工资照付的假日等等，有助于改善劳动人民的生活。但要把整个经济生活的水平大大提高，还要走一段很长的路。
    由于在第二次世界大战中日军和英军、盟军的反复争夺，仰光曾遭到的破坏特别严重。战前每年曾经能够吞吐三百多万吨的货物仰光港口，整个七哩长的码头线都被炮火轰塌了。港里塞满了沉船和破毁的设备。几年来，经过清理和重建，现在已经恢复到可以接纳一万五千吨的大船，一年可以处理一百五十万吨以上的货物。
    由于大力扩建和重建汽油工业，现在缅甸的汽油差不多已经可以自足。缅甸的运输业也有很大的发展。在离市区十几哩的孟加拉洞地方，1952年新建的一个巨大机场，有两条八千多呎长的跑道，可容最大的喷气飞机，是东方少有的现代化机场。从这里坐国营航空公司的飞机，能通全国约四十处城镇。这个公司和铁路局、海运局以及内河运输公司，都是缅甸政府按照宪法关于国有化的规定实行专营的主要企业，在过去几年中都有了不少的发展。
    按照缅甸政府制定的“福利计划”，在若干年的时期中间要达到农产品的全部自给；将以几亿缅币投资于发展工矿和电力企业而把国民总产值提高到七十亿缅币（战前是五十五亿缅币）。在苏联、中国和其他一些国家的帮助之下，正在兴建一些新的工厂。
    缅甸识字的人占全国人口的60％。这也许出乎外国来访者的意想之外，这一方面是由于寺院制度的传统，年青人受戒学经，同时就得到了初步文字的教育。另一方面，在独立以后，政府在普及教育方面确实作了不少努力。拿高等教育来说，仰光大学是全国的最高学府。它有着一座宽广的校园，位在幽静的燕子湖滨。目前有学生九千，在独立以前只有一千五百人。
    今日的缅甸，到处充满着新的气象，这是摆脱了殖民奴役而得到独立自由的人民所特有的气象。仰光和缅甸其他地方的人民正在筹备着他们喜庆的节日——独立纪念日。进行了长期英勇斗争的缅甸人民，在八年多以前，终于迫使英帝国主义承认缅甸民族独立的权利。1948年1月4日被宣布为民族独立的国庆节日。在仰光市中心的广场花园里，庄严地矗立着一座高达一百多呎的石碑，这就是为纪念缅甸民族独立而建立的。它是缅甸人民的光荣和骄傲。在谈到独立的时候，有一件事使缅甸人民感到沉痛的：在独立前夕，他们所拥戴的缅甸民族独立运动领袖昂山将军，同他的几位同志遭到了敌人的暗杀。在大金塔的西北方向，一座朴素的屋宇复盖着一排九个白色坟墓，这就是昂山将军和他的战友长眠的地方。为了纪念他对缅甸民族独立的功绩，在大湖边上开辟了一座以昂山命名的公园，在公园大门口，树立着昂山将军的铜像。在这风和日暖的日子，到这地方来游玩的人特别多。昂山的像引起他们对于独立斗争的回忆。（附图片）
