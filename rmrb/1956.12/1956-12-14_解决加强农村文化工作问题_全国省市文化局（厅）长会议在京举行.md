    Resolving the Issue of Strengthening Rural Cultural Work
    National Provincial and Municipal Cultural Bureau (Hall) Chiefs Conference Held in Beijing
    Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: The National Conference of Provincial (Autonomous Region) and Municipal Cultural Bureau (Hall) Chiefs, convened to arrange next year's cultural work, began today in Beijing.
    The conference will summarize this year's work, and, in connection with the main experiences and lessons of cultural work over the past few years, make arrangements for next year's work. The conference will also focus on resolving the issue of strengthening rural cultural work and arranging for private professional theatrical troupes.
    Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing spoke at today's meeting.
    Vice Minister of Culture Qian Junrui gave a report at today's meeting on the summary of cultural work in 1956 and the guidelines and tasks for cultural work in 1957.
    Prior to the opening of this conference, a five-day preparatory meeting was held, during which the heads of the cultural bureaus (halls) of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities attending the meeting, as well as relevant personnel, provided a great deal of information and opinions.
    Cultural workers have achieved great successes this year, and a new, active atmosphere has emerged. Mass cultural work in rural areas has developed greatly; literary and artistic creation and performance activities are increasingly prosperous; erroneous ideas that slight national heritage in music, opera, and fine arts work have been criticized; the socialist transformation of private cultural enterprises has been basically completed; the work of dealing with reactionary, absurd, and obscene publications has been greatly rewarding; work on strengthening the arrangement of private professional theatrical troupes and assisting folk artists has been strengthened; publishing work has greatly developed; libraries, museums, and cultural relics work have also achieved new successes. This year, China's art troupes have visited and performed in various countries, gaining high acclaim.
    In this year's cultural work, some work departments and some regions experienced adventurism in the first half of the year. The Ministry of Culture once had excessively high and rapid development requirements for certain cultural undertakings in its guiding ideology, which consequently affected some aspects of practical work where quality was neglected. In addition, cultural departments did not provide sufficient support for cultural work in minority areas, emerging industrial and mining areas, and remote areas. There was insufficient promotion, support, leadership, and management of national and folk art undertakings that the masses loved and urgently needed.
    The conference is scheduled to end on the 17th.

    解决加强农村文化工作问题
    全国省市文化局（厅）长会议在京举行
    新华社13日讯　为布置明年文化工作而召开的全国省（自治区）、市文化局（厅）长会议，今天起在北京举行。
    会议将总结今年的工作，并联系过去几年来文化工作中的主要经验教训，对明年的工作加以安排。会议还将着重解决加强农村文化工作和安排民间职业剧团的问题。
    文化部部长沈雁冰在今天的会上讲了话。
    文化部副部长钱俊瑞在今天会上作了关于1956年文化工作总结和1957年文化工作方针任务的报告。
    这次会议开幕之前，先举行了五天预备会议，由出席会议的各省、自治区、市文化局（厅）长和有关人员提供了许多情况和意见。
    今年文化工作者有很大的成绩，出现了新的活跃气象。农村群众文化工作有极大的发展；文艺创作和演出活动日益繁荣，对音乐、戏曲、美术工作中轻视民族遗产的错误思想作了批判；对私营文化事业企业的社会主义改造已经基本完成；处理反动、荒诞、淫秽书刊的工作大有收获；加强了安排民间职业剧团和帮助民间艺人的工作；出版工作有很大发展；图书馆、博物馆和文物工作也都有了新的成绩。今年我国的艺术团体在各国访问演出，获得很高声誉。
    在今年的文化工作中，某些工作部门，某些地区在上半年曾经发生过冒进现象。文化部曾经一度在指导思想上对某些文化事业的发展要求过高过快，因而影响到实际工作中的某些方面有忽视质量的情况。另外，文化部门对少数民族地区、新兴工矿地区、边远地区的文化工作支持不够。对群众所爱好、急需的民族、民间文艺事业的提倡、支持和领导管理不够。
    会议预定在17日结束。
