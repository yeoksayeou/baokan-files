Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Dispatch: (Xinhua News Agency reporter Cheng Kun reports:) The Ningxiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has thoroughly transformed its leadership style. The secretary and members of the county committee took the lead in going to the countryside, and in less than half a month, winter production has been vigorously launched.

This year, due to severe drought in Ningxiang County and bureaucracy in the leadership of the county committee, the total income from agricultural and sideline production has decreased compared to last year. Only 62% of the commune members in the county increased their income. Until the beginning of December, winter production in rural areas had not been carried out. Many commune members demanded to withdraw from the commune; about half of the commune cadres in the county were in low spirits and unwilling to continue working.

In response to this situation, the Ningxiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an enlarged cadre meeting from December 5th to 11th, attended by more than 1,000 county, township, and commune cadres, to humbly solicit everyone's opinions on the leadership work of the county committee. At the meeting, everyone focused on criticizing the bad work style that has gradually grown among county-level cadres in recent years, who are eager for comfort, unwilling to go to the countryside and share hardships with the peasants. Some cadres even rode bicycles to the countryside in the morning and back to the county town for rest in the evening. The county party secretary also reviewed himself for being entangled in various meetings at the higher levels and in the county year after year, becoming a "meeting secretary," rarely delving into and solving problems in agricultural cooperatives, making the county committee's leadership divorced from reality and causing losses to this year's production work.

At the meeting, the county committee decided that in the future, the secretary should personally take action. In addition to regularly having one or two standing committee members stay at home to take care of daily work, all seven standing committee members of the county committee should go deep into the agricultural cooperatives and share hardships with the commune members, implementing concrete leadership. At the same time, it was also decided to divide the county's sixty-one townships into seventeen districts, drawing 196 cadres from the county, led by members of the county committee and county-level responsible cadres, to be stationed in each district for long-term work. In addition, 200 cadres will be drawn from the county to form mobile work teams to go deep into communes with relatively weak work and disaster-stricken communes. After the meeting, many cadres took off their woolen uniforms and leather shoes, put on cloth clothes again, and went to the countryside to work. On December 18th, amidst wind and snow, the county party secretary and the members of the Lianmeng Agricultural Cooperative carried mud from the pond to accumulate fertilizer in the snow.

Since the county committee strengthened the concrete leadership of rural work, in just over ten days, the county's winter production campaign has rapidly unfolded.

### 领导干部下乡与群众共甘苦  宁乡冬季生产很快由松散变为活跃

    领导干部下乡与群众共甘苦
    宁乡冬季生产很快由松散变为活跃
    据新华社长沙电　新华社记者程坤报道：中共湖南省宁乡县委员会彻底转变领导作风，书记和县委委员带头下乡，不到半个月冬季生产就轰轰烈烈地开展起来。
    宁乡县今年由于旱灾严重和县委领导上的官僚主义，农副业生产的总收入都比去年减少了，全县增加收入的社员只占62％。直到12月初，农村冬季生产始终未开展起来，很多社员要求退社；全县大约有一半的社干部情绪低落，不愿再干工作。
    针对这种情况，中共宁乡县委员会在12月5日至11日召开了一次有一千多县、乡、社干部参加的扩大干部会议，虚心征求大家对县委领导工作的意见。在会上大家着重批评了近年来在县上干部中逐渐滋长起来的贪图安逸不愿下乡和农民同甘苦的坏作风。有的干部甚至早上骑自行车下乡，晚上又骑自行车回县城休息。县委书记也检讨了自己成年累月地纠缠在上级和本县的各种会议里面，成了“开会的书记”，很少深入研究和解决农业社中的问题，使县委的领导脱离实际，使今年的生产工作受到损失。
    会上，县委决定今后书记要亲自动手，县委七个常委除经常留一、二人在家照管日常工作外，大家都要深入农业社和社员一道同甘共苦，实行具体领导。同时还决定把全县六十一个乡划成十七片，从县上抽调一百九十六名干部，由县委委员和县级负责干部率领分别驻片长期工作；另外，还要从县上抽调二百名干部组成机动工作组，深入工作比较薄弱的社和受灾社工作。会后，很多干部就脱下呢制服和皮鞋，重新穿上布衣服下乡工作去了。18日这一天风雪交加，县委书记和联盟农业社的社员一道，冒雪挑塘泥积肥。
    自从县委加强农村工作的具体领导以后，不过十多天，全县的冬季生产运动就迅速开展起来。
