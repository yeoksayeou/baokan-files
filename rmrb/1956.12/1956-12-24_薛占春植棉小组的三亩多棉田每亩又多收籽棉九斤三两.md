Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi Telegram On October 10th this year, the Xue Zhanchun cotton planting team of the Agricultural Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region, Anjihai Farm, created a new national record for cotton yield per unit area. After all three mu and eight fen and four li of cotton fields they planted were harvested, the original average yield of seed cotton was 1,677 jin, one liang and six qian per mu, which then became 1,686 jin, four liang and six qian, with an average increase of nine jin and three liang per mu compared to the original yield.

The reason why the Xue Zhanchun cotton planting team's three mu plus of cotton fields were able to yield an average of nine jin and three liang more seed cotton per mu was because they followed the instructions of Wang Muhan and other responsible cadres of the Shihezi Reclamation Area troops to return to the cotton fields to "clean up" and obtained it. From then on, whenever Xue Zhanchun and others talked about this matter with people, they would say: "We shouldn't forget to carefully harvest after a bumper harvest; this is a lesson."

    薛占春植棉小组的三亩多棉田每亩又多收籽棉九斤三两
    据新华社乌鲁木齐电　今年10月底，新疆军区农业生产建设部队安集海农场的薛占春植棉小组，创造了棉花单位面积产量的全国新纪录。他们种植的三亩八分四厘棉田全部收摘后，原来每亩平均产籽棉一千六百七十七斤一两六钱，后又变成一千六百八十六斤四两六钱，每亩平均比原来多收九斤三两。
    薛占春植棉小组的三亩多棉田，所以能每亩平均又多收了九斤三两籽棉，是由于他们遵照石河子垦区部队负责干部王慕韩等的指示，重新到棉田“打扫”而取得的。从此，薛占春等和人们一谈起这件事情的时候，便说：“丰产了不该忘记精收，这是一个教训。”
