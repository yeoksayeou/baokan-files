Account of the Deeds of the Martyrs of the Chinese Art Troupe to South America
Zhao Feng

The Chinese Art Troupe visited four South American countries: Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, and Argentina. Everywhere they went, the South American people welcomed the Chinese artists with a festive spirit, calling us "envoys of cultural friendship." They believed that our visit and performances strengthened mutual understanding and knowledge between the Chinese and South American people, changing the abnormal situation of relatively few cultural exchanges between the Chinese and South American people due to geographical barriers and other human-made reasons. Precisely because the South American people fully recognized this, they waited outside the theater for two or three hours to pay tribute to the actors, lined up outside the theater early in the morning to buy tickets, artists traveled from hundreds of kilometers away to sing folk songs for the Chinese guests, and children rushed to the airport to embrace the Chinese artists from afar.

Among these touching events, we also cannot forget the overseas Chinese who were far from their motherland but loved it deeply. In Chile, some overseas Chinese chartered planes from cities a thousand kilometers away to Santiago to see the performances. In Brazil, an elderly overseas Chinese man attended every performance at the theater for two weeks. Some people said, "After seeing the plays from the motherland, I can die in peace." Others held the actors' hands and said excitedly, "Now that you've come, we overseas Chinese also have glory."

The vast majority of overseas Chinese in South America have spent half their lives working hard to establish themselves in foreign countries, but they all have endless longing for their motherland. Some overseas Chinese were even enjoying outstanding artistic performances from their motherland for the first time, which universally ignited their patriotic enthusiasm.

Here, we cannot help but think of the deceased comrades Li Dechun and Rao Qifeng. Comrade Li Dechun was the deputy secretary-general of the art troupe, responsible for external liaison. Comrade Rao Qifeng was from Guangdong, and he always came forward to participate in the reception of Cantonese-speaking overseas Chinese. Their enthusiastic, caring, and moving attitude was highly praised by many overseas Chinese. An elderly overseas Chinese man personally told us with emotion, "The people of the new society are even different in their attitude towards others compared to before!"

The new moral character of the artists of New China did indeed leave a deep impression on the South American people. In Buenos Aires, Argentina, the hotel staff who hosted us said, "I have hosted many foreign artists, but I have never seen artists as cultured as the Chinese artists." Many backstage staff at the theaters were always surprised to see our actors immediately organizing their costumes and props after their tense work. A stage technician in Sao Paulo, Brazil, with 45 years of experience said, "Chinese artists are the most moral. They help each other dress and practice. They consciously assist the technical staff in tidying up backstage after the performance. For some of our Western artists, these tasks are beneath their dignity." In this regard, Comrades Wu Mingshen, Liu Youchun, and Zhang Chunlai, who were recognized as role models for the entire troupe, assisted with costumes, headgear, and props. After playing three or four roles continuously every day, especially after the continuous tumbling in the final performance of "Yandang Mountain," even though they were soaked in sweat, they still insisted on assisting with the technical work day after day for four months. It is no wonder that many South American theater workers always gave them a thumbs-up behind their backs to express their admiration.

Comrades Jiang Wenlin and Wang Wenhua were in charge of costume management. Traveling performances involved frequent movement, and every time we arrived in a country, there were many procedures such as customs declaration and inspection, and we also had to try the scenery and lighting before the performance, so time was always tight. During the busiest times of stage setup, they often couldn't take care of eating or sleeping. And whenever we left a city, they often had to work overnight to pack the costumes and props. But they always completed their tasks happily and never complained. What was especially touching was that Comrade Jiang Wenlin often washed the underwear used for performances for the actors late at night. He said, "Washing it myself is cleaner and faster, which ensures it's ready for tomorrow's performance and saves the country a little money. If these underwear are given to others to wash, the cost of washing them twice would be enough to make a new one." The smiling expression on his face when he said these words is something we will never forget.

Comrade Deng Ziruo had the most simple and honest character. The foreign stage technician who worked with him said, "Mr. Deng has a heart of gold." It was precisely his simple lifestyle and excellent work style that led the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace to call him a "good friend of the Vietnam Peace Committee" in their condolence message.

Comrade Yu Liang was a person who knew how to work and how to live. He lived enthusiastically and cared for and helped others enthusiastically. During the journey, he often took out his beloved harmonica and used the tune of "Ode to the Motherland" to inspire and encourage everyone's emotions. In external affairs, he was able to be cautious and perceptive. We never saw him in a moment of depression.

Comrade Zhang Huaigen served as translator and accountant. The currency values of the South American countries were different, and our itinerary passed through the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Switzerland, so frequent calculations and exchanges were necessary. He had never managed money or kept accounts before, but for four months, he sat in the hotel office day and night calculating accounts, guarding public property, and staying behind to maintain contact. He didn't get to go sightseeing, and sometimes he even gave up opportunities to others to watch the performances in order to take care of the staff.

Comrade Li Dechun was responsible for external liaison and the ideological education of the entire troupe. In an unfamiliar and complex environment, he dealt with external affairs while also taking care of the theater early every evening until the end of the performance. After dinner, it was often already one o'clock in the morning, but in order to solve some comrades' pressing ideological problems, he would talk deeply with them until three or four o'clock. The actors could sleep until noon the next day, but he would have overseas Chinese visiting him at eight or nine o'clock in the morning. What impressed us most was his meticulous spirit. When he saw phenomena that harmed the interests of the Party and the country, he always adhered to principles.

The deeds of the deceased comrades of the Chinese Art Troupe to South America will be gloriously recorded in the annals of our country's cultural undertakings and will forever live in the hearts of our country's cultural and artistic workers as our good example and will be a force that forever inspires us to move forward.

Our country's role in international affairs is constantly improving, and its influence is constantly strengthening. In order to strive for a further relaxation of the international situation, we must further strengthen cultural exchanges and friendly activities with the people of all countries in the world to strive for lasting world peace. China's cultural and artistic workers are honored to contribute to the cause of world peace. The martyrs who contributed their lives to this noble cause have even greater glory. The unfinished cause of the martyrs will be fully shouldered and continued by China's cultural and artistic workers. (Attached picture)

    记述赴南美艺术团死难烈士的事迹
    赵沨
    中国艺术团访问了南美洲的智利、乌拉圭、巴西、阿根廷四个国家，所到之处，南美人民以一种节日的欢乐心情来迎接中国的艺术家们，称我们为“文化友好的使节”，认为我们的访问演出加强了中国和南美人民之间的相互了解和认识，改变了由于山川阻隔和其他人为的原因而造成中国人民和南美人民间文化往来关系比较疏少的不正常情况。正是南美人民充分认识到这一点，他们因而才在剧场外鹄候二、三小时来向演员致敬，清晨即在剧场外排队购票，艺术家自数百公里外赶来为中国客人演唱民歌，儿童们也赶到机场来拥抱远方的中国艺术家们。
    在这些感人的事例中，我们也忘记不了远离祖国而热爱祖国的华侨们。在智利，有些侨胞自一千公里外的城市乘坐包机赶到圣地亚哥参观演出。在巴西，有位华侨老人在两周内每场都到剧院观摩。有的人说：“看了祖国的戏，死了也可以瞑目了。”有的人执着演员的手激动地说：“你们来了，我们华侨也有了光彩了。”
    在南美的华侨，绝大多数都是半生艰苦奋斗在异国成家立业，但他们都对祖国有着无尽的怀念。有些侨胞甚至是初次欣赏到祖国的优秀的艺术表演，这普遍地激发了他们的爱国热情。
    在这里，我们不能不想起死难的李德椿、饶其丰两位同志。李德椿同志是艺术团副秘书长，负责对外联系，饶其丰同志是广东人，对粤籍侨胞接待总是由他出面参与。他们两位热情、关怀、感人的态度，是许多华侨赞不绝口的。一位华侨老人亲自感慨地向我们说：“新社会的人，连对人的态度也和以前大不相同了！”
    新中国艺术家的新的道德风貌，的确也给与南美人民以深刻的印象。在阿根廷的布宜诺斯艾利斯，招待过我们的饭店服务人员说：“我招待过许多外来的艺术家，但我从来没有见过像中国艺术家这样有教养的。”许多剧场的后台人员看见我们的演员在紧张的工作之后立刻去整理服装和道具，他们总是惊奇不置。巴西圣保罗有一位有四十五年工龄的舞台技术人员说：“中国艺术家是最有道德的。相互帮助整装，相互帮助练习。自觉地协助技术人员在演出后整理后台。对我们有些西方艺术家说，这些工作是不屑一顾的。”在这一方面，被公认是全团表率的吴鸣申、刘又春、张春来三位同志，或协助服装或协助盔头、把子。在每天连续赶演三、四个角色，特别是最后演出“雁荡山”连续翻滚之后，他们虽然混身被汗浸透了，但仍然四月如一日地坚持协助技术工作。这也难怪许多南美剧院工作者总是在他们背后伸出大姆指表示称赞了。
    蒋文林、王文华同志是管理服装工作的。旅行演出经常流动，而每到一个国家总有报关、验关等许多手续，而我们演出前还要试景试光，时间总是紧迫。装置舞台工作最繁忙时，他们经常是顾不上吃饭、睡觉。而每当离开一个城市时，又经常需要漏夜赶工把服装、道具装箱。但他们总是愉快地完成任务，从来没有一句怨言。而尤其令人感动的是蒋文林同志经常连夜为演员洗涤演出用的内衣，他说：“自己洗的又干净又快，一来保证明天演出应用，二来为国家可以节省一点钱。这些内衣，如果给人家去洗，洗两次的钱也可以重新作一件了。”他说这几句话时的微笑着的神情，是我们终生不能忘记的。
    邓子若同志有着最质朴的性格，和他一同工作的外籍舞台技术人员说：“邓先生有着黄金的心。”正是他的质朴的生活作风和优良的工作作风，越南保卫世界和平委员会的唁电中称他为“越南和平委员会的好朋友。”
    俞良同志是个会工作也会生活的人。热情地生活，热情地关怀别人帮助别人。在旅途中，他常常拿出心爱的口琴，用“歌唱祖国”的曲调来振奋、鼓舞起大家的情绪。在对外工作中，能做到慎重而敏锐，我们从来没有看见过他心情有颓唐的时刻。
    张槐根同志担任翻译兼会计，南美各国币值不一，而且我们行程经过苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞士各国，经常要折算兑换。他从来没有管过钱，记过账，但他四个月来，日日夜夜坐在旅馆的办公室里算账、看守公物、留守联系。别人参观没有他的份，有时照顾工作人员的观摩他还让给别人。
    李德椿同志担任对外联系和全团思想教育工作。在生疏复杂的环境中一方面应付对外工作，而每天晚间他总先期到剧场照料直至终场。吃晚饭后，经常是在深夜一时了，但他为了解决一些同志迫切的思想问题，还和同志们深谈到三、四时。第二天，演员们可以睡到中午，而他在清晨八、九时便会有华侨来拜访了。给我们最深刻的印象的是他的不苟的精神。他看见了损害党和国家利益的现象时，总是坚持原则的。
    赴南美洲艺术团死难同志的事迹将光辉地被记载到我国文化事业的史册中，更将永远活在我国文化艺术工作者的心中，作为我们的好榜样，并且将是永远鼓舞我们前进的力量。
    我国在国际事务中的作用正不断提高，影响正不断加强。为了争取国际局势的进一步和缓，我们必须进一步加强世界各国人民的文化往来和友好活动，来争取世界持久和平。中国的文化艺术工作者以能为世界和平事业贡献一分力量为荣。死难烈士们为这一崇高事业而贡献了自己的生命则更是他们伟大的光荣。烈士们未竟的事业，中国的文化艺术工作者会全力地担当起来、继续下去。（附图片）
