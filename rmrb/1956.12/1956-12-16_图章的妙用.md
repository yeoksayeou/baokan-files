    The Wonderful Use of Seals
  　Chen Zequn
    Everyone knows the general use of seals. Without them, some "procedures" simply cannot be done.
    However, the seals of some people, especially the seals of responsible persons in some units, are not entirely for handling "procedures," but have other, more ingenious uses.
    When a unit sends a representative to seek help from another unit, if, in addition to the official letter, the responsible comrade can also write a "private letter" to the other party with a seal, experienced people say that the effect is often much greater. Even if the wording of this "private letter" is the same as the official letter, and it is still not handwritten.
    When issuing an instruction to grassroots personnel, if a leader's private seal can be added in addition to the official seal, it is said that some people's work efficiency is often much faster. Although the matter to be handled is specified, and even the person handling it knows it should be done, the addition of a private seal seems to make their actions more justified, and there is more evidence to refer to in the future, as "instructed by a certain leader," making them more enthusiastic about doing it. Therefore, whether or not a document has a leader's private seal has almost become an important indicator for some people to distinguish between urgent and non-urgent matters.
    In order to adapt to these people's psychology, seals are densely stamped on the pages of documents within some units, a dazzling array. I have seen several covers of process manuals, on which a small team of seals are neatly arranged, exhibiting the seal styles of almost all section chiefs, workshop directors, work section leaders, and even the chairman of the trade union below the factory director. The sealers certainly don't have time to flip through these thick manuals one by one, but they have to stamp their seals, because if their own seals are not "seated" in the printed team frames, leaving them blank is not only unsightly, but also seems to imply an unwillingness to take responsibility.
    In this way, wouldn't leaders at all levels be busy stamping seals all day long, which is too hard? Not really. Some people have come up with some clever "compromise" solutions. In order to avoid being constantly called out of meetings or away from the dinner table to stamp seals, section chiefs simply hand over their seals to everyone in the section to use at will. Factory directors are even more clever, simply engraving a few more seals, placing one in the secretary section specifically for issuing official documents, one in the finance section specifically for writing checks, and another in the planning section for statistical reports. … In this way, the seals can both act as the master's surrogate, and save the subordinates the trouble of running around to seek seals, and the documents have seals, which means that they are all "personally decided," and the recipients also think they are qualified. Thus, everyone is happy.
    Gradually, some people no longer find this practice strange, and even think that it can only be like this, and it should be like this. However, I feel that this trend really cannot be encouraged.
    I am not eager to advocate abolishing seals and switching to signatures, but I feel that handling affairs should be more important than stamping seals, and understanding the content of instructions is more meaningful than identifying the sealer's seal. Thinking for the unit leaders: if you have the energy to do everything yourself, of course it is best, if not, why bother to use your own seal to make a symbolic "personal attendance"? And I also hope to remove some of the strict rules and regulations regarding stamping, and whether the documents and reports meet the specifications should not only depend on whether the seal queues are neatly arranged.

    图章的妙用
  　陈泽群
    图章的一般用场，大家都知道。离了它，一些“手续”之类，就简直没有法子办。
    然而，有些人的图章，特别是一些单位负责人的图章，其作用就不完全是办“手续”而已，却另有更高妙的用处。
    一个单位派代表有求于另一单位，如果在公函以外，能够再由负责同志向对方写一封盖图章的“私函”，据有经验的人谈，效果就往往大得多。那怕这个“私函”的措词和公函一样，而且依然也不是亲笔。
    向基层人员下达一个批条，公章之外，如果能再加上一个首长的私章，有些人的办事效率据说也每每快得多。虽然指定要办的事，连经办人也明知该做，但加上一个私章，他们做起来就似乎更师出有名，日后也更有据可查，是“某首长批示的”，干来也更热心。因此，文件有无首长私章，几乎成为某些人区别急办与缓办的重要标志。
    为了适应这些人的心理，于是，一些单位内的文件页上图章就盖得密密麻麻，琳琅满目。我曾见过几本工艺过程册的封面，上面整整齐齐地排了一小队的图章，厂长以下，几乎各科科长、车间主任、工段长以至工会主席的图章式样都展览上去了。盖章者当然没有时间把这些厚厚的册子一一翻阅，然而不得不盖章，因为自己的图章如果不在印好的成队框框里“入座”，空着不但不雅观，而且似乎有不愿负责之嫌。
    这样，各级负责人岂非要整天忙于盖章，太辛苦了些么？倒也不是的。有人就想出了一些聪明的“折衷”办法。科长为了省得总是被人从会场里或餐桌上请出来盖章，就只好索性把自己的图章交给科内各人听任使用。厂长呢，就更高明一层了，干脆多刻几个章，秘书科摆一个，是专为签发公文用的；财务科摆一个，是专为开支票用的；计划科又摆一个，是为统计报表用的。……这样，图章既能替主人分身，下级也省去奔忙求章之苦，而文件有了章就表示都是“亲自决定”的，受文者也认为合了格。于是，皆大欢喜。
    渐渐，就有些人对这种作法不以为怪，进而认为只好如此，理当如此了。然而我却觉得此风真不可长。
    我倒不是急于就主张废止图章而改用签字，只觉得办事应该比盖章更要紧得多，了解批示的内容比鉴别批示者的图章更有意义。为单位领导者着想：如果有精力事事躬亲当然最好，倘不，又何苦仅仅凭自己的图章去作象征性的“躬亲”？而且也希望能去掉一些关于盖章的清规戒律，文件报表合不合规格，不应该光看图章排队是否整齐。（附图片）
