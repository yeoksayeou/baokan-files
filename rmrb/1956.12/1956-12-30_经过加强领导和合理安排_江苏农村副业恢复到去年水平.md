　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 29th. Jiangsu Province's rural sideline production has recovered to last year's level, and the output value of major sideline occupations has even exceeded last year. According to statistics at the end of November, the province's hog inventory reached 6.75 million head, an increase of 1.61 million head compared to the end of last year; the number of chickens, ducks, and rabbits raised has also increased, with some areas exceeding last year's figures by one to four times.

　　Jiangsu Province's rural sideline production began to recover and develop after the tendency to relax leadership over sideline production was reversed in May of this year. Since then, Party committees at all levels and agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province have generally appointed responsible cadres to specifically manage sideline production. Agricultural cooperatives in various places have more rationally divided the scope of sideline business operations between the cooperatives, production teams, and members, and have rearranged farm work to allow members time to participate in household sideline production. Relevant economic departments have also provided strong support and assistance. The state grain departments allocated more than 130 million jin of grain as feed supply in the second half of the year, the Jiangsu branch of the China Food Company adjusted hog purchase prices, and issued 5 million yuan in advance hog purchase deposits to support farmers in raising pigs. In order to support farmers in disaster areas in developing sideline production, departments purchasing sideline products actively improved operations, reduced operating links, saved operating costs, and increased the purchase prices of dozens of sideline products. Recently, supply and marketing cooperatives in disaster areas have also signed more than 2,000 production and sales combination contracts for sideline products with agricultural production cooperatives, with advance payments of nearly 2 million yuan.

    经过加强领导和合理安排
    江苏农村副业恢复到去年水平
    新华社南京29日电　江苏省农村副业生产已经恢复到去年的水平，主要副业的产值并且超过了去年。据11月底统计，全省生猪圈存六百七十五万头，比去年年底圈存数量增加了一百六十一万头；饲养鸡鸭和家兔的数量也有增加，有些地方超过了去年一倍到四倍。
    江苏省农村的副业生产，是在今年5月扭转了对副业生产放松领导的偏向以后开始恢复和发展的。从那时开始，全省中共各级党委和农业生产合作社，一般都指定负责干部专管副业生产。各地农业社都比较合理地划分了合作社、生产队和社员经营副业的范围，并且重新安排了农活，使社员有时间参加家庭副业生产。有关经济部门也给了大力的支持和帮助。国家粮食部门在下半年内拨出一亿三千多万斤粮食作为饲料供应，中国食品公司江苏省分公司调整了生猪收购价格，并且发放了生猪预购订金五百万元，支持农民养猪。为了支持灾区农民开展副业生产，收购副业产品的部门积极改善经营，减少经营环节，节约经营费用，提高了几十种副业产品的收购价格。最近灾区供销合作社还和农业生产合作社签订了两千多份副业产品的产销结合合同，预付定金近两百万元。
