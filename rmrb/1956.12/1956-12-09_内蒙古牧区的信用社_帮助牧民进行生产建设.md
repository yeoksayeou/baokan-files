　　Credit Cooperatives in Inner Mongolia Pastoral Areas
　　Help Herdsmen with Production and Construction

    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, December 8th: The number of credit cooperatives in the pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has now grown to one hundred and forty-five, more than one and a half times the number last year. The number of herdsmen households joining the cooperatives accounts for more than 39% of the total number of herdsmen households.

    With the increase in herdsmen's income, the total amount of their savings deposits has also increased. According to incomplete statistics, it has now exceeded one million yuan, equivalent to eleven times the total savings deposits for the entire year last year.

    Since the beginning of this year, the credit cooperatives in various pastoral areas have used this accumulated money to help herdsmen purchase feed and fodder, increase livestock protection equipment, and herdsmen with fewer livestock have also added livestock. Mutual aid and cooperation organizations in areas such as Xilin Gol League have built more than 380 houses on their settlements after obtaining loans from credit cooperatives. Herdsmen who lacked food also purchased more than 2.4 million catties of food.

　  内蒙古牧区的信用社
　　帮助牧民进行生产建设
    新华社呼和浩特8日电　内蒙古自治区牧区的信用合作社，目前已经发展到一百四十五个，比去年增加了一倍半以上，入社牧户占到总牧户的39％多。
    随着牧民收入的增加，牧民们的存款总额也增加了。据不完全统计，现已超过一百万元，相当于去年全年存款总额的十一倍。
    各牧区的信用社，今年以来用这批汇集起来的钱帮助牧民购买饲料饲草，增加了保畜设备，少畜的牧民还增添了牲畜。锡林郭勒盟等地的互助合作组织，从信用社得到贷款后，在自己的定居点上盖起了三百八十多间房屋。缺少口粮的牧民，还购买了二百四十多万斤食粮。
