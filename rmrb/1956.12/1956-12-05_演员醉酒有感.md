　　Reflections on Actors' Drunkenness
　　Wang Guanya
　　This time, the Anhui Huangmei Opera Troupe toured Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, and Bengbu. Wherever we went, the local authorities would always "prepare a little something" and invite the main actors to a meal. Sometimes it was one table, sometimes as many as two or three.
　　These "little somethings" cost at least twenty yuan a table for the cheaper ones, and forty or fifty yuan for the more expensive ones. There were not many actors invited, and there were always local dignitaries as guests.
　　After being drunk and full, the lead actors went back with dry, hoarse throats, exhausted, and the guests didn't find any meaning in this kind of drinking either.
　　Although these banquets are mostly paid for by public funds, it is said that this is "legal." Because since there is this "entertainment expense," wouldn't it be a "pity" not to eat?
　　In order to show "welcome," there is also a strange etiquette at "banquets," which is "pouring wine." It is said that the depth of affection can be expressed by the amount of "pouring wine."
　　The host's kindness is of course appreciated, but the unlucky ones are the actors who are "honored guests."
　　In Bengbu, where there was a performance in the evening, some actors were "poured" so much that they were still vomiting before going on stage. Some borrowed the excuse of being drunk to act crazy, half-serious, half-fake, cursing and hitting, screaming loudly. Others were so drunk that they couldn't get up. At this time, it is difficult to see even a little bit of an artist's demeanor on them, just like the drunkards described in Gorky's works in the Tsarist era.
　　Is this "respecting" actors!
　　I don't think so. There are many ways to welcome and express affection, and it is not necessary to have a meal and drink it all down. It's better to avoid that kind of "little something" if possible. Besides, our social atmosphere advocates thrift!

### 演员醉酒有感

　　演员醉酒有感
　　王冠亚
    安徽省黄梅戏剧团这次巡回演出，经过北京、天津、济南、蚌埠。凡是到过的地方，当地的有关方面总要“略备菲酌”请主要演员去吃上一顿。少的是一桌，多的三两桌不等。
    这种“菲酌”，便宜的要二十余元一桌，贵一些的则为四、五十元。被请的演员为数不多，少不得还有当地的知名之士做陪客。
    酒醉饭饱以后，角儿们回去嗓子干哑，疲惫不堪，做陪客的也不会觉得这种酒会有什么意思。
    虽则这些酒会大都由公家开支，但据说这是“合法”的。因为既然有这笔“招待费”，不吃也岂不“可惜”？
    为了表示“欢迎”，在“酒会”上还有一种奇怪的礼节，那就是“灌酒”。据说人情的厚薄可以从“灌酒”的多少上表现出来。
    主人的盛情固然可感，但倒霉的是作为“佳宾”的演员们。
    在蚌埠，晚上要演出，有的演员被“灌”得临上台之前还在呕吐。有的则借酒装疯，半真半假，乱骂乱打，大声嘶叫。还有的是醉得起不来了。这时候很难看到他们身上还有一点点艺术家的风度，就像高尔基作品中描写的沙皇时代的那些酗酒之徒。
    这是“尊敬”演员么！
    我看，不见得。欢迎的方式，表示人情的方式，可以有多种多样，不一定非要吃上一顿，喝它一通不可。那种“菲酌”，可免还是免了的好。何况我们的社会风气是提倡节约的呢！
