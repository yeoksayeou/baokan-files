Xinhua News Agency, Mangshi, December 16th. Zhao Kun Zhuo, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister of the Union of Burma and Chief of Shan State, who was invited to attend the Sino-Burmese Border People's Friendship Association Meeting, said at a welcome banquet held tonight by Liu Minghui, Acting Governor of Yunnan Province, for the leaders of the two governments: "From now on, there is no so-called border issue between our two countries. In the past, we may have had some misunderstandings, but after the efforts of the Prime Ministers, there are no misunderstandings at all now. The most important thing is to develop the brotherly and sisterly friendship between the two countries. As long as we develop this friendship, there will be no difficulties between us." As soon as he finished speaking, more than four hundred friends participating in the banquet in the hall immediately cheered "Long live!" and toasted to Sino-Burmese friendship.

The banquet was held in a large auditorium in Mangshi. The orchestra played lively tunes, and brothers from both countries toasted each other during the banquet. After a speech by Liu Minghui, Acting Governor of Yunnan Province, Prime Minister U Ba Swe then spoke. He first expressed his gratitude on behalf of the Government and people of the Union of Burma and all the Burmese representatives attending the meeting for the warm reception from the Chinese Government and people. He said that they had received a warm reception from the Chinese leaders and people, a reception like that of close brothers. When they came to China, they saw many ethnic people who were the same as the ethnic groups of the Union of Burma in terms of clothing, appearance, and language. The similarity between them is not only on the surface but also in their hearts. Therefore, they call the Chinese "Pauk-Phaw," and "Pauk-Phaw" means close brothers. He also said that the friendship between the two countries largely depends on the friendship between the border people of the two countries. As long as the border people of the two countries are friendly, the friendly relations between the two countries will surely be consolidated and developed. Therefore, let us ensure the continuous development of the friendship and close exchanges between the people of the two countries.

Amidst applause, Premier Zhou Enlai walked smilingly to the microphone. He said: "In my capacity as the Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, I accept the friendship of Chief Zhao Kun Zhuo. Our two countries are indeed connected by mountains and rivers. Geography connects us, and the border cannot separate our friendship. Chief U Zan Hta Sin of Kachin State said that we are from the same race and are relatives. Prime Minister U Ba Swe said that the people of our two countries are 'Pauk-Phaw,' and the border cannot separate our kinship, nor can it separate our 'Pauk-Phaw' relationship. Through this Sino-Burmese Border People's Friendship Association Meeting, our kinship will become even closer, and our 'Pauk-Phaw' relationship will become even friendlier. Let our kinship be preserved and developed for generations to come." Finally, Premier Zhou Enlai raised his glass and said to everyone, "Let us drink a stronger and more enthusiastic glass of Moutai, watch the play, have a good sleep, and go to our relatives' country tomorrow."

After the banquet, Premier Zhou invited the distinguished guests to rest in the garden. Premier Zhou and the distinguished guests stood on the ground covered with thick pine needles, holding hands and taking pictures. Then, the two Prime Ministers attended the cultural evening.

    云南省代省长刘明辉举行宴会
    招待中缅两国政府领导人
    新华社芒市16日电　应邀参加中缅两国边境人民联欢大会的缅甸联邦副总理兼外交部长、掸邦邦长藻昆卓，今天晚上在云南省代省长刘明辉为两国政府领导人的到来举行欢迎宴会上说：从现在起，我们两国之间已不存在所谓边界问题。在过去，我们可能有些误解，但是经过总理们的努力，现在一点误解也没有了。最为重要的，是发展两国之间兄弟姐妹般的友谊，只要发展这种友谊，我们之间不会存在什么困难。他的话刚讲完，大厅里参加宴会的四百多个朋友顿时连声高呼万岁，为中缅友好干杯。
    宴会是在芒市的一个大礼堂里举行的。管弦乐队奏着轻快的曲子，两国兄弟席间互为祝颂。在云南省代省长刘明辉致词后，吴巴瑞总理接着讲话。他首先代表缅甸联邦政府和人民，以及参加这次大会的缅甸全体代表，对于中国政府和人民热情招待表示感谢。他说，我们受到了中国领导人和人民的热情招待，这是一种亲兄弟般的招待。当我们来到中国时，我们看到许多民族人民，与缅甸联邦的民族不论从服装上、面貌上和语言上都是一样的。他们之间的相同，不但在表面上，而且在内心里。所以，我们称呼中国人为“胞波”，“胞波”就是亲兄弟的意思。他又说，我们两国的友好，在很大程度上，依靠两国边境人民的友好。只要两国边境人民友好，两国的友好关系就一定得到巩固和发展。因此，让我们保证不断地发展两国人民的友好和亲密的来往。
    周恩来总理在人们掌声中含笑走向扩音器边。他说：我以中华人民共和国外交部长的身份，接受藻昆卓邦长的友谊，我们两国的确是山连山，水连水，地理上把我们连在一起，边界不能够把我们的友谊分开。克钦邦邦长吴赞塔信说过，我们是同一个种族来源的，并且是亲戚的关系。吴巴瑞总理说我们两国人民是“胞波”，边界是不能把我们的亲戚关系分开的，不能把我们“胞波”关系分开的。经过这一次中缅两国边境人民联欢大会，我们的亲戚关系将亲上加亲，我们的“胞波”关系将更加友好，让我们的亲戚关系世世代代保存和发展下去。最后，周恩来总理举起杯来向大家说，让我们喝一杯更强烈、更热情的茅台酒，看完戏，睡个好觉，明天到我们亲戚国家去。
    宴会结束，周总理邀请贵宾到花园里休息。周总理和贵宾们站在铺了厚厚松针的地上，手挽手地照相，接着两国总理又出席了文艺晚会。
