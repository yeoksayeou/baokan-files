Editor's note: Many leading organs have already begun to streamline their structures. All organs that have conducted inspections admit that their structures are too large and there are too many personnel, and that they should be streamlined. However, the determination to transfer stronger personnel to strengthen grassroots organizations is still not strong enough. Because the basic situation of our national organs at present is that there are too many people at the top and fewer people at the bottom, the upper-level organs are too large and the lower-level organs are weaker. Only by streamlining the upper levels and enriching the lower levels can we effectively overcome bureaucracy, truly change the top-heavy situation, and do our work better. In this regard, the practice of the Heilongjiang Provincial Water Conservancy Department is noteworthy. Because it not only dispatches 38% of its staff to enrich the lower levels, but also equips them with more than one-fifth of the staff with independent working ability.

This newspaper reports: The Heilongjiang Provincial Water Conservancy Department is carrying out reorganization work in accordance with the spirit of streamlining the upper levels and enriching the lower levels, and has decided that the number of personnel to be streamlined and dispatched will account for 38% of the total number of personnel in the department.

Since November, the department has successively studied this work at the party group meetings and departmental affairs meetings of the department, and mobilized the heads of various departments and offices to check the problems existing in the water conservancy system. After inspection, it was found that the structure of the water conservancy system in the province was top-heavy. Hundreds of water conservancy technicians in the province are concentrated in the department, while the counties are very short of water conservancy technicians. Some counties have a large task of developing farmland water conservancy this year, but they do not have a professional technical cadre. Many technical problems cannot be solved by the counties, and it is difficult for the department to solve them in time. In this way, the work of the department is very passive, and the special districts and counties also have opinions. Not only that, because technical cadres are concentrated in the provincial department, they are often sent out to work, and travel expenses have also increased greatly; because the upper-level institutions are large, the arrangements for life have also increased difficulties. The phenomenon of overlapping internal institutions in the Water Conservancy Department is also very serious. The department has a finance section, and the engineering department and the survey and design department also have finance sections (groups). Each section has a cashier and an accountant. A total of thirty-two people in a department do financial work, which is not only not good for the work, but on the contrary, they often meet and affect the work. There are similar situations in general affairs work.

According to the problems found, the Water Conservancy Department and relevant parties have consulted and initially determined a plan for streamlining the structure. The plan determines that out of the 860 people in the department, in addition to the 150 people who have been dispatched, another 180 people will continue to be dispatched, accounting for more than 38% of the total number of people. The dispatched personnel will first enrich the counties that lack or have no water conservancy technicians, and the remaining personnel will be assigned to the special districts. The Water Conservancy Department is also determined to equip more than one-fifth of the 180 personnel dispatched this time with comrades who can work independently.

    改变头重脚轻现象　切实加强基层组织
    黑龙江水利厅精简上层充实下层
    确定抽出总人数的38％的人员下放到专区和县
    编者按：不少领导机关已经开始精简机构。凡是进行了检查的机关，都承认自己的机构太庞大，人员太多，应该进行精简。可是抽调较强的人员去加强基层组织的决心还很不够。因为我们目前国家机关的基本情况是上面的人太多，下面的人较少，上面的机构太大，下面的机构较弱。只有精简上层充实下层，才能有效地克服官僚主义，真正改变头重脚轻的状况，把工作作得更好。在这一点上，黑龙江省水利厅的作法是值得注意的。因为它不仅下放38％的工作人员去充实下层，而且其中还配备了五分之一以上有独立工作能力的工作人员。
    本报讯　黑龙江省水利厅根据精简上层充实下层的精神进行整编工作，决定精简下放的人员占全厅总人数的38％。
    该厅自11月以来，先后在厅的党组会议及厅务会议上研究了这项工作，并动员各处室科的负责人检查水利系统机构上存在的问题。经过检查，发现全省水利系统机构头重脚轻。省内数百名水利技术干部都集中在厅内，各县则十分缺乏水利技术干部。有的县今年发展农田水利的任务很大，但是没有一个专业的技术干部。许多技术问题县里不能解决，厅里又难及时解决。这样厅的工作十分被动，各专区和县还有意见。不仅如此，由于技术干部集中在省厅，经常派出工作，出差旅费也大大增加；因为上层机构庞大，生活安排等方面也都增加了困难。水利厅内部机构重叠现象也很严重，厅里有财务科，工务处、勘查设计处也有财务科（组），每个科都有出纳、会计，一个厅作财务工作的共达三十二人之多，不仅对工作没好处，相反经常碰头影响工作。总务工作也有类似情形。
    根据检查出的问题，水利厅和各有关方面进行了协商，初步确定了精简机构的方案。方案确定，全厅八百六十人中除已下放一百五十人以外，还将继续下放一百八十人，占总人数38％强。下放的人员首先充实缺乏或没有水利技术人员的各县，下余人员分配到各专区。水利厅并决心在这次下放的一百八十名人员中，配备上五分之一以上能够独立工作的同志。
