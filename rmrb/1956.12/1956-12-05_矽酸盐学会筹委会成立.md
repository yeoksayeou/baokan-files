　　Preparatory Committee of the Silicate Society Established

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the preparatory committee of the Chinese Silicate Society was established in Beijing on the 2nd of this month; and Lai Qifang was elected as the chairman, with Yang Enjiu, Wang Tao, and Yan Dongsheng as vice-chairmen.

    The members of the preparatory committee include more than 30 silicate experts, engineers, and administrative heads from departments such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, Tianjin University, Nanjing Institute of Technology, and the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies.

    Chen Yuntao, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, introduced the recent developments in China's silicate industry and the main points of the development plan for the next twelve years at the inaugural meeting of the preparatory committee. He said that the purpose of preparing to organize the Silicate Society now is to unite the nation's silicate science and technology workers, carry out academic activities, promote scientific research, and exchange work experience, so as to rapidly catch up with the world's scientific and technological level in this field. Chen Yuntao also mentioned that at present, it is particularly necessary for silicate experts to assist the state in improving the quality of silicate industrial products, expanding new products in the silicate industry, trial-producing glass fiber and glass tubes that can replace steel materials, and establishing special refractory materials and special ceramic products required by new science and technology.

    The silicate industry includes products such as cement, refractory materials, glass, ceramics, and enamel, and is very closely related to national industrial construction and people's daily lives.
