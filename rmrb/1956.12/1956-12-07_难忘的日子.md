　　Unforgettable Days

    The Shanghai Peking Opera Theatre spent sixteen days as guests in Moscow. Starting from November 8th, they performed eleven shows at the Stanislavski-Danchenko Music Theatre. Now, they have concluded the first phase of their performance tour in the Soviet Union and departed from Moscow to perform in Leningrad and other places.

    The repertoire performed in Moscow consisted of nineteen pieces, with the most frequently performed being "Yandang Mountain" and "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet" (five times each), and the least frequently performed being "Xiao He Chasing Han Xin Under the Moon" and "The Drunken Concubine" (once each). Other pieces were performed two, three, or four times. The most popular plays included "Yandang Mountain," "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet," and "San Cha Kou" (The Crossroads). "Fisherman's Revenge," "The Banana Fan," "Stealing the Immortal Herb," "Sizhou City," "Picking the Sliding Cart," "Little Shepherd Boy," "Double Shooting Geese," "Autumn River," and "Joining the Army, Leaving the Kiln" were also widely and enthusiastically welcomed by Soviet audiences. The play that received the most curtain calls was "Sizhou City."

    The Shanghai Peking Opera Theatre brought a total of twenty-one plays to the Soviet Union this time. Only "The Eight Immortals Cross the Sea" and "Yang Paifeng" did not have the opportunity to meet the audience in Moscow. All the other plays were performed. Judging from the theater's reaction, these plays were understandable and appreciated by the Moscow audience. A grand play like "Fifteen Strings of Cash" was performed three times in eleven shows, and the performance effect improved each time. "Fisherman's Revenge," which takes more than seventy minutes to perform, also managed to capture the audience from beginning to end, drawing them into the dramatic situation, making them cry or laugh for the characters' fate. "Picking the Sliding Cart" was originally thought to be incomprehensible to the audience, but after testing, the audience still deeply loved it. Of course, the Soviet Union's outstanding announcer, Balakseyev, participated in the work, fully and thoroughly introducing the plot to the audience, which greatly helped the performance.

    From the eleven performances in Moscow, a preliminary experience was gained: introducing Peking Opera to foreign countries in its original form, without unnecessary shortening, allowing foreign audiences to fully appreciate our performing arts and the characteristics of opera, is not only possible but also necessary.

    Many Soviet art masters came to the backstage after watching the play and praised Chinese classical art and Chinese actors with extremely enthusiastic words. They said very humbly, "We have learned many valuable things from you." That sincere attitude was truly moving.

    Soviet audiences very much liked the clown performances in Peking Opera. Lou Ashu in "Fifteen Strings of Cash" certainly won the love of many audiences, and even when Mr. Ge in "Fisherman's Revenge" came out, it would cause some laughter from the audience. Liu Lihua in "San Cha Kou" and Jiao Guangpu in "Stopping the Horse" both restored their old makeup, with white noses. Soviet audiences have the same view as Chinese audiences: their white noses are coordinated with their movements; removing the white noses while leaving the original set of "opening jump" movements is a very inappropriate method.

    The Soviet people warmly welcomed the performances of the Shanghai Peking Opera Theatre. Various newspapers and magazines in Moscow featured reports, reviews, interviews, stills, and life photos about the Shanghai Peking Opera Theatre's visit to the Soviet Union. The film studio produced a color documentary. The radio station used various methods to broadcast to the Soviet Union, China, and various People's Democratic countries, introducing Chinese Peking Opera art and the Shanghai Peking Opera Theatre's visit to the Soviet Union. The TV station also arranged programs about the Shanghai Peking Opera Theatre twice on November 6th and 18th.

    The Soviet government also specially arranged an opportunity for the actors of the Shanghai Peking Opera Theatre to meet with Moscow artists. At the "House of Artists," a large family that gathered Moscow writers, playwrights, musicians, and artists, Chinese people-familiar film actors such as Lei Aijin (the protagonist of "It Seems We've Met") and Makarova (the protagonist of films such as "Rural Doctor") intimately talked with Chinese actors. At the meeting, Soviet puppeteer Obraztsov, who had been to China, spoke as the host. He said, "We Soviet artists, in addition to each having a family with a wife and children, also have a common home here; today, we feel very happy because you, Chinese artists, have come to our home." Soviet color documentary director Krisky, a Soviet filmmaker who had been to China and filmed the film "Page of History" about the Chinese countryside, said with an admiring tone, "In China, new flowers are constantly blooming."

    November 19th was an even more unforgettable day. In the Central Column Hall of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, the Soviet Ministry of Culture and the Moscow City Soviet jointly organized a grand party to allow people from all walks of life in Moscow to meet and celebrate with all comrades of the Shanghai Peking Opera Theatre. Here, in addition to the speeches by artist Kozlovsky, the deputy chairman of the City Soviet, Saitsev, and the director of the theater, Zhou Xinfang, representatives of Moscow's advanced workers, outstanding students, and Young Pioneers presented gifts respectively. The leaders of the Grand Theater, leading the various characters they had performed, walked onto the stage in colorful costumes. The Maly Theatre was represented by the oldest actress in the Soviet Union, the ninety-year-old Yablochkina, who spoke and presented a gift; the circus troupe jumped onto the stage flipping somersaults and performing acrobatics. The Young Pioneers, spirited, drumming on copper drums, blowing bugles, and shouting slogans, walked onto the stage neatly and solemnly, presenting their small drums and bugles to the Shanghai Peking Opera Theatre.

    When all the comrades of the Shanghai Peking Opera Theatre arrived at the Column Hall, these lovely Young Pioneers rushed down from the stairs, and they solemnly presented red scarves to the guests.

    After the party dispersed, the representatives of all walks of life in the Soviet Union who attended – there were so many labor models and people's actors here – holding lanterns, surrounded the comrades of the Shanghai Peking Opera Theatre, singing and dancing all the way, and sent them all the way to the Central Hotel on Gorky Street where the guests were staying. It was already twelve o'clock at night, outside the snow was flying, and the temperature was around minus ten degrees Celsius, but passion made the hosts and guests forget the time, season, and place. Everyone arm in arm, heart to heart, sang loudly and strode forward together. Film cinematographers and news photographers scrambled to capture the scenes, and the people who were seeing them off also strove to be photographed into the lens. The procession surged forward from time to time, and people walked faster and faster, forgetting the slippery snow under their feet. After arriving in front of the hotel, the hosts and guests hugged and danced wildly again. The shouts of "Moscow-Beijing," "Long Live," and "Hurrah" rose and fell like waves. The sixty-three-year-old director Zhou Xinfang was also surrounded by the core of the crowd like a young man. Indeed, he became very, very young that night.

    The Shanghai Peking Opera Theatre left Moscow and continued to visit and perform in Leningrad and other places. They deeply miss Moscow and the Muscovites, deeply miss the incomparable warmth and enthusiasm given to them by the Muscovites.　　　　　　　　November 20, Moscow

　　难忘的日子
　　陶雄
    上海京剧院在莫斯科作了十六天的客，从11月8日开始，在斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基—丹钦科音乐剧院公演了十一场，现在已经结束了第一阶段的访苏演出任务，离开莫斯科到列宁格勒等地去演出了。
    在莫斯科演出的剧目共有十九个，最多的演出五次（“雁荡山”、“拾玉镯”），最少的演出一次（“萧何月下追韩信”、“贵妃醉酒”等），其他各演出二、三、四次不等。最受欢迎的戏有
  “雁荡山”、“拾玉镯”、“三岔口”等。“打渔杀家”、“芭蕉扇”、“盗仙草”、“泗州城”、“挑滑车”、“小放牛”、“双射雁”、“秋江”、“投军别窑”等也受到苏联观众广泛的热烈的欢迎。谢幕次数最多的一出戏为
  “泗州城”。
    这次上海京剧院带到苏联来的戏一共是二十一个，只有“八仙过海”和“杨排风”没有得到机会在莫斯科和观众见面，其他的戏全都拿出来了。从剧场反映来看，这些戏是可以被莫斯科观众理解和欣赏的。像“十五贯”这样的大戏，在十一场中共演出了三场，演出效果一次比一次好。“打渔杀家”要演七十几分钟，也能自始至终抓住观众，把他们引进戏剧的情境，让他们为角色的命运哭或笑。“挑滑车”原来估计不能为观众所理解，但经过考验，观众却还是深深地喜爱它。当然，苏联杰出的报幕人巴拉克谢耶夫来参加工作，把剧情充分详尽地向观众介绍清楚，对演出的帮助是很大的。
    从莫斯科十一场的演出，初步摸索到了一条经验：把京剧按照它的本来面貌介绍到国外去，不作不必要的节缩，让外国观众充分欣赏我们的表演艺术和戏曲的特点，不仅是可以的，而且是必要的。
    许多苏联的艺术大师看完戏之后，都跑到后台来，以无比热情的言词，颂扬中国的古典艺术和中国的演员。他们非常谦虚地说：“我们向你们学到了许多宝贵的东西。”那种真诚的态度真使人感动。
    苏联观众非常喜欢京剧中小丑的表演。“十五贯”中的娄阿鼠固然赢得了许多观众的喜爱，即使“打渔杀家”中的葛先生走出来，也会引起观众一些笑声。“三岔口”的刘利华和“拦马”的焦光普都恢复了老扮相，勾上了白鼻子。苏联观众和中国观众有同样的看法：他们的白鼻子是同他们的动作相协调的；拿掉白鼻子而留下了原来的整套的“开口跳”的动作，是一个很不妥当的办法。
    苏联人民非常欢迎上海京剧院的演出。在莫斯科各种各样的报章杂志上都出现了关于上海京剧院访苏演出的报道、评论、访问记、剧照和生活照片。电影厂摄制了五彩纪录片。电台采用多种多样的方法来向苏联国内、中国、各人民民主国家广播，介绍中国京剧艺术，介绍上海京剧院的访苏活动。电视台也在11月6日和18日两次安排了关于上海京剧院的节目。
    苏联政府还特别安排了一个机会，使上海京剧院的演员和莫斯科的艺术家们会见。在“艺术家之家”，一个集中了莫斯科的作家、戏剧家、音乐家和美术家的大家庭里，中国人民所熟悉的电影演员雷爱金（“我们好像见过面”的主角）、玛卡洛娃（“乡村医生”等片主角）等，都和中国演员亲切地谈心。在会上，曾到过中国的苏联木偶戏导演奥布拉兹卓夫以主人的身份讲了话，他说：“我们苏联的艺术家，除去各人有个妻子儿女的家而外，这里还有一个共同的家；今天，我们感觉非常幸福，因为你们，中国的艺术家，来到了我们的家里。”苏联五彩纪录片的导演克里斯基，一位到过中国、拍过有关中国农村的电影“历史一页”的苏联电影工作者，以一种赞叹的口吻说：“在中国，新的花朵不断地开放着。”
    11月19日，是一个更难忘的日子。在全苏工会中央理事会中央圆柱大厅，苏联文化部和莫斯科市苏维埃联合主办了一次盛大的联欢会，让莫斯科各界人士同上海京剧院的全体同志会面、联欢。这里，除去艺术家科兹洛夫斯基和市苏维埃副主席赛茨夫以及周信芳院长的讲话而外，莫斯科先进工人的代表、优秀学生的代表、少先队的代表分别献了礼。大剧院的领导人，领导着他们所演出过的剧目的各个角色，五彩缤纷地走上台来。小剧院是由全苏最老的女演员、九十岁的亚布洛契金代表讲话并献礼；马戏团的队伍，是翻着跟斗，耍着杂技跳上台来的。少先队员，精神抖擞，敲着铜鼓，吹着洋号，喊着口令，整齐肃穆地走上台来，把他们的小鼓小号献给了上海京剧院。
    当上海京剧院的全体同志到达圆柱大厅的时候，这些可爱的少先队员从楼梯上一拥而下，他们把红领巾庄严地献给了客人们。
    联欢会散了以后，与会的苏联各界代表——这里有多少劳动模范和人民演员呀——打着灯笼，簇拥着上海京剧院的同志，一路唱着跳着，一直送到客人所住的高尔基大街的中央旅馆。已经深夜十二时了，外面大雪飞舞着，气温在零下十度左右，可是激情使主人和客人都忘记了时间、季候和地点。大家臂挽着臂，心连着心，一齐高歌迈进。电影摄影师和新闻摄影记者手忙脚乱地抢镜头，送客的人们也争取自己能被拍入镜头，行列时时往前奔涌，人们越走越快，大家都忘记了脚下泞滑的积雪。到达旅馆门前之后，主人和客人又拥抱着狂舞起来。“莫斯科—北京”、“万岁”、“乌拉”的呼声像浪潮一样地起伏着。六十三岁的老院长周信芳也像青年似的被包围在人潮的核心中。的确，这天晚上他是变得非常非常年青了。
    上海京剧院离开莫斯科，到列宁格勒等地继续去作访问演出了。他们深深怀念着莫斯科和莫斯科人，深深怀念着莫斯科人给予他们的无比温暖的热情。　　　　　　　　11月20日于莫斯科（附图片）
