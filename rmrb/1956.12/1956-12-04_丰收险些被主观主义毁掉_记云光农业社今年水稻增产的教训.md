　　—A Record of the Lessons Learned from Increased Rice Production in Yunguang Agricultural Cooperative This Year—

　　On November 29th, we arrived at Baiyun Village in Jieyang County, Guangdong Province, where the late rice harvest of the Yunguang Agricultural Cooperative, led by national agricultural production model Lin Yancheng, had just been completed. We met with him and the cooperative's management committee. He told us that the average yield of late rice for the entire cooperative was 762 jin per mu. Including the early rice, the average yield of double-cropping rice on 920 mu this year increased by 71.3% compared to last year. Among them, 1.88 mu of high-yield fields averaged 1927.2 jin per mu.
　　During our visit, the cooperative members repeatedly praised the favorable weather conditions this year. However, almost all the members said that this year's bumper harvest was by no means a gift from heaven. Lin Jinhe, the secretary of the Chinese Communist Party branch, even told us: "Don't think this year's bumper harvest was due to favorable weather; the risks we experienced this year were even more severe than natural disasters."
　　It turned out that as early as the "Beginning of Spring" season, the county regarded the amount of dry-sown rice area adopted as a measure of whether cadres were right-leaning and conservative. The county and district cadres stationed in the Yunguang Agricultural Cooperative insisted that Lin Yancheng fully promote dry sowing across the board, regardless of conditions. As long as he hesitated slightly, these stationed cadres would put pressure on him with words that were half encouragement and half criticism, such as "responding to the Party committee's call" and "a model should take the lead." In order to avoid being labeled "backward and conservative," Lin Yancheng had no choice but to bite the bullet, persuade the members, and lead the cooperative in fully promoting dry sowing. However, Lin Yancheng and some cooperative cadres always felt unsure, and they went to the seedling fields to check every day. After several days, the seedlings still had not emerged. Later, Lin Yancheng no longer cared about being "conservative" or not; after discussing with Lin Jinhe, he told the members to sow an additional 26 mu of wet-sown seedlings in case of emergency. Facts proved that half of the 76 mu of dry-sown seedlings were frozen to death due to the cold and lack of moisture, leaving more than 300 mu of land without seedlings to transplant. Fortunately, there were 26 mu of wet-sown seedlings, which basically saved the cooperative from a serious shortage of seedlings. Lin Jinhe recalled the situation at the time and said: "If we hadn't taken this step, our cooperative's early rice would not have increased in production."
　　After the cooperative successfully completed the early rice transplanting task, the risk of excessive topdressing appeared during mid-cultivation. This not only increased costs but also caused the rice to lodge, affecting yield. The reason for excessive topdressing was: At the end of last year, the 34 households of the Yunguang Agricultural Cooperative, based on their own conditions, formulated a plan to produce an average of 1752 jin per mu of double-cropping rice this year, and used this to challenge the three cooperatives led by Li Shunda and others. Based on last year's increase in production, it was possible to complete this plan. However, by early March of this year, after mergers and acquisitions, the Yunguang Agricultural Cooperative had increased to 337 households, and the cultivated area had also expanded several times. Based on the new situation, Lin Yancheng requested the county to allow them to revise the production plan. However, the person in charge of the Chinese Communist Party Jieyang County Committee said: "Once a challenge is issued, it cannot be easily modified." He only agreed to "provide extra care" by providing more commercial fertilizer to help them complete the original plan. Later, in topdressing, the cooperative put forward the slogan of "seeking grain from fertilizer." It just so happened that Lin Yancheng was ill at this time. The opinions of some members with farming experience did not attract the attention of the cooperative cadres and stationed cadres. As a result, some fertile fields were topdressed excessively, and the early rice seedlings experienced early lodging. At the end of the summer harvest, the yield of these early rice was much lower than originally estimated. The cooperative's early rice only increased by 18%.
　　The members' complaints about the unsatisfactory early rice harvest made the stationed cadres realize the harm of the high plan. The cooperative finally revised the production plan. The average yield of double-cropping rice per mu for the entire cooperative was changed from 1752 jin to 1562 jin; the yield of high-yield fields was changed from 2150 jin to 2050 jin. The revised plan also stipulated that the main measure to increase production of late rice was to promote single-seedling close planting on 60% of the area. According to the cooperative's conditions at the time and drawing on last year's high-yield experience, this plan was achievable. Unfortunately, in the process of promoting the advanced experience of single-seedling close planting, some cooperative cadres and stationed cadres allowed it to drift along. At the same time, the labor quota for transplanting had not been properly set for a long time, and members were unwilling to adopt the more labor-intensive single-seedling close planting method in order to compete for work points. At this time, Lin Yancheng went to the county to seek medical treatment due to illness. Lin Jinhe, the secretary of the Chinese Communist Party branch, asked the members to strive to complete the single-seedling close planting plan, but did not get everyone's support. Lin Jinhe then went to the city to tell Lin Yancheng about the situation. The two rushed back to the cooperative, on the one hand, convened a meeting of the cooperative affairs committee to criticize the laissez-faire attitude, and on the other hand, revised the labor quota, raising the amount of work points for transplanting single seedlings per mu from two to three. In the end, there were 176 mu of late rice in the cooperative that were single-seedling close planted, and the rest were small-seedling close planted. After several twists and turns, the cooperative cadres and stationed cadres deeply realized that agricultural technology reform must proceed from reality. When applying topdressing fertilizer to the late rice, the cooperative's management committee first conducted a survey of the cooperative's rice fields, determined the amount of fertilizer to be applied based on the soil quality and seedling growth, and then organized experienced farmers from each production team to apply the fertilizer. Therefore, the seedlings all grew generally well. As a result of the harvest, the yields of many originally low-yield fields caught up with the high-yield fields.
　　The Yunguang Agricultural Cooperative finally achieved a bumper harvest after overcoming numerous man-made obstacles throughout the year. Recalling this arduous journey, Lin Yancheng breathed a sigh of relief and said, "This year has given us many lessons. Everyone wants to increase production and harvest more grain, but it must proceed from reality. If not, increasing production will turn into reducing production."

　　丰收险些被主观主义毁掉
　　—记云光农业社今年水稻增产的教训—

    11月29日，我们来到广东省揭阳县白云村的时候，全国农业增产模范林炎城领导的云光农业社的晚稻刚收割完毕。我们在这个社的管理委员会和林炎城晤谈。他告诉我们，全社晚稻平均每亩产七百六十二斤。连同早稻计算，今年九百二十亩双季稻每亩平均产量比去年增加71.3％。其中有一点八八亩丰产田，平均每亩达到一千九百二十七点二斤。
    在访问的日子里，社员们一再赞美今年风调雨顺的情景。可是，几乎所有的社员都说，今年丰收绝非天赐。中共支部书记林锦河甚至对我们说：“别以为今年丰收靠风调雨顺，今年经历的风险比自然灾害还厉害呢。”
    原来早在“立春”时节，县里把采用水稻旱播面积的多少，看作测量干部是否右倾保守的标准。驻在云光农业社的县、区干部硬要林炎城不顾条件百分之百地全面推广旱播。只要他稍稍犹豫，这些驻社干部便用“响应党委号召”、“模范要带头”等半鼓励半责难的话向他施加压力。为了避免带上“落后保守”的帽子，林炎城只得硬着头皮说服社员，带领全社全面推广旱播。但是林炎城和一些社干部总觉得没有把握，天天到秧田里去察看。好几天了，还未见秧苗出土。后来，林炎城再也不管什么“保守”不“保守”了；他和林锦河商量以后，便叫社员另外多播了二十六亩水播秧，以防万一。事实证明，七十六亩旱播秧苗因天寒和缺乏水分而冻死了一半，使得三百多亩地没有秧插。幸亏有二十六亩水播秧苗，才基本上挽回了社里严重缺秧的局面。林锦河回忆当时的情况时说：“没有走好这步棋，我们社的早稻就不会增产了。”
    这个社胜利完成早稻插秧任务以后，到中耕的时候又出现了追肥过多的风险。这不仅增加成本，而且使禾稻倒伏，影响了产量。造成追肥过多的原因是：去年年底，三十四户的云光农业社根据本身的条件，制定了今年双季稻平均每亩产一千七百五十二斤的计划，并且以此向李顺达等领导的三个社应战。按照去年增产的情况看，完成这个计划是可能的。可是到今年3月初，经过转社、并社之后云光农业社已经增加到三百三十七户，耕地面积也扩大数倍。根据新的情况，林炎城便请求县里同意他们修订生产计划。但是，中共揭阳县委员会的负责人却说：“既经提出应战，不能随便修改。”他只答应“额外照顾”多给商品肥料，帮助他们完成原定计划。后来在追肥中，社里就提出
  “向肥要谷”的口号。恰巧这时林炎城病了。一些有耕作经验的社员的意见，没有引起社干部和驻社干部的重视。结果，部分肥田追肥过多，早稻禾苗发生早期倒伏的现象。夏收结束，这些早稻的产量比原来的估计低得多。全社早稻只增产18％。
    社员对早稻收成不满意而产生的埋怨情绪，使驻社干部认识到计划偏高的危害。这个社终于修订了生产计划。全社双季稻每亩平均产量从一千七百五十二斤改为一千五百六十二斤；丰产田的产量从两千一百五十斤改为两千零五十斤。修订了的计划还规定，晚稻的主要增产措施是在60％的面积上推广单株密植。按照当时社里的条件，吸取去年丰产的经验，这个计划是可能实现的。可惜的是在推广单株密植的先进经验中，有些社干部和驻社干部却听其放任自流。同时，插秧的劳动定额长期没有搞好，社员为了争工分，不愿意采用费力较多的单株密植法。这时，林炎城又因病而去县城里医治。中共支部书记林锦河要求社员力争完成单株密植的计划，没有得到大家的支持。林锦河便进城去，把情况告诉林炎城。两人赶紧回社，一方面召开社务委员会，批判放任自流的态度，另一方面修订劳动定额，把插单株每亩用二个工提高到三个工。最后，全社晚稻单株密植的有一百七十六亩，其余都是小株密植。经过几度波折，社干部和驻社干部都深深体会到农业技术改革必须从实际出发。在晚稻施追肥的时候，社的管理委员会先对全社稻田作了调查，根据土质和禾苗生长情况，决定施肥数量，然后组织各生产队有经验的农民施肥。因此，禾苗都生长得一般好。收割的结果，许多原来是低产田的产量，都赶上了高产田。
    云光农业社一年来冲破重重人为的障碍，终于取得了丰收。林炎城在回忆这段艰苦的路程时舒了一口气，说：“这一年给了我们很多的教训。人人都想增产，多收一些粮食，但是一定要从实际出发。不这样，增产就会变成减产”。
