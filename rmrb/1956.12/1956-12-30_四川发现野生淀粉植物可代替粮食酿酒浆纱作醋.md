Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 26th December. The discovery of more than twenty kinds of wild starch plants has opened up a new path for Sichuan Province to save grain in the future. These plants, including Qinggangzi (Cyclobalanopsis glauca), wild prickly pear, wild plum, etc., were discovered by supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Sichuan Province this year when they sent people to go deep into the mountains. They have now been used to replace grain for winemaking, making pulp, pulping yarn, making vinegar, and as pig feed.

The wine brewed by the Yibin supply and marketing department using Qinggangzi has a fragrant aroma and a wine yield of 40%, and has been rated as a first-class wine by relevant departments. This Qinggangzi can also be ground into powder to make vermicelli for consumption. Another wild plum for making vinegar was discovered by the Xuanhan County supply and marketing department. One hundred catties of wild plums can make seventy catties of vinegar, and the taste is also very delicious.

According to estimates by the Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the annual output of these newly discovered wild starch plants this year is about 270 million catties, with a total value of more than 7 million yuan. Among them, if all four types of wild starch plants that replace coarse grains for winemaking and eight types that replace flour for making pulp and pulping yarn are fully utilized, more than 25 million catties of flour and more than 26 million catties of sorghum can be saved each year.

    四川发现野生淀粉植物可代替粮食酿酒浆纱作醋
    新华社成都26日电　二十多种野生淀粉植物的发现，为四川省今后节约粮食开辟了一条新的道路。这些植物包括青杠子、野刺梨、野李子等，是四川各地供销合作组织今年派人深入山区发现的。现在他们已经用来代替粮食酿酒、制浆糊、浆纱、作醋和用作猪的饲料。
    宜宾供销合作部门利用青杠子酿的酒，气味芬芳，出酒率达40％，已经被有关方面评为甲等酒类。这种青杠子还可磨成粉作成粉条供食用。另一种作醋的野李子是宣汉县供销合作部门发现的。一百斤野李子可以制作七十斤醋，味道也很鲜美。
    据四川省供销合作社估计，今年新发现的这些野生淀粉植物年产量约有两亿七千多万斤，总值七百多万元。其中如把代替杂粮酿酒的四种和代替面粉制浆糊和浆纱的八种野生淀粉植物全部利用起来，每年就可以节约面粉两千五百多万斤，节约高粱两千六百多万斤。
