    Xinhua News Agency, December 12th dispatch from Paris: According to Western news agencies, Britain and France are planning to re-open negotiations with Egypt based on the “Eighteen-Nation Plan” for “international control” of the Suez Canal.

    Sources say that Britain has asked the United States to guarantee its support for forcefully clearing the canal immediately before withdrawing its invading troops. The United States has also indicated that it supports Britain and France in negotiating with Egypt “under the auspices of the United Nations.” It also intends to use its influence to ensure the canal opens to navigation "soon." To this end, U.S. Acting Secretary of State Herbert Hoover is scheduled to hold talks with Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi within a day or two. It is said that Hoover is trying to persuade Fawzi of the need to resume negotiations on resolving the Suez issue as soon as possible.

    Xinhua News Agency, December 12th dispatch from TASS, London: British Labor Party left-wing leader Aneurin Bevan delivered a speech at a mass meeting in London on the evening of the 10th, condemning the Anglo-French attempt to seize the Suez Canal.

    Bevan continued, "The canal can be blocked with bombs, but it is impossible to keep it open with bombs." He said, "The British government should first of all be criticized for having attempted to seize the canal by methods that were bound to block it... In modern society, it is impossible for a government to maintain itself by whips, boots, or the use of force."

    美国支持英法策划重新谈判的诡计
    企图迫使埃及同意国际管制运河
    据新华社12日讯　巴黎消息：据西方通讯社报道，英国和法国正打算以“国际管制”苏伊士运河的“十八国计划”为基础，同埃及重开谈判。
    有消息说，英国已经要求美国保证支持它在撤退侵略军以前就立即强行清理运河。而美国也已经表示，它支持英法在“联合国主持下”同埃及谈判。它还打算运用它的影响来使运河“早日”通航。为此，美国代理国务卿赫伯特·胡佛在一两天之内就要同埃及外交部长法齐举行谈判。据说胡佛企图努力说服法齐，使他相信有必要尽快恢复关于解决苏伊士问题的谈判。
    据新华社12日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国工党左翼领袖比万10日晚间在伦敦群众大会上发表演说，谴责英法夺取苏伊士运河的企图。
    比万继续说，运河可以用炸弹来堵塞，但是不可能用炸弹来保持它的通航。他说，“英国政府首先应当受到批评的是，它曾经企图用必然会导致运河堵塞的方法来夺取运河……在目前社会里，一个政府要靠鞭子、皮靴或使用武力来维持那是不可能的。”
