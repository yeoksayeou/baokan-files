　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 7th. Tianjin's five state-owned cotton textile factories, in the "zero defect" competition to improve cotton cloth quality, have been learning from each other, drawing on strengths to offset weaknesses, and have already achieved good results. In November, the average percentage of cloth woven by these five factories that met the "zero defect" standard (meaning the cloth coming off the loom required no repairs and had no flaws) reached nearly 29%; more than double that of September, the first month of the competition. Among the eight weaving workshops of the five cotton textile factories, three workshops achieved a "zero defect" rate of over 42% in November.

　　During the competition, each factory summarized its own experiences and exchanged and observed best practices. The No. 1 Weaving Workshop of the Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory improved the position of the shuttle retainer by carving a groove in the base plate of the shuttle box. This prevented the yarn ends trailing on the shuttle from being re-woven into the cloth after a shuttle change, which caused defects such as frayed edges. After learning this experience, the Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory adopted measures such as timely inspection and repair of weft cutting knives, increasing its "zero defect" rate from 13.96% in October to 44.79%. The No. 1 Weaving Workshop of the Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory promoted the experience of the No. 1 Weaving Workshop of the Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory in eliminating small blemishes such as oil stains, and also changed the practice of cleaning the looms before a warp beam was fully used. This greatly reduced small blemishes such as oil stains, resulting in a "zero defect" rate of 43.75% in November. In October, this workshop's "zero defect" rate was only 18.75%.

### 在天津：五个厂提高棉布质量

　　在天津：五个厂提高棉布质量
    新华社天津7日电　天津的五个国营棉纺织厂在提高棉布质量的“零分布”竞赛中，互相学习，取长补短，已经有了很好的成绩。这五个工厂在11月份里织出的布合乎
  “零分布”标准（即从布机上落下来的布，不需要经过任何修补，没有一点毛病）的平均达到近29％；比竞赛第一个月——9月份增加了一倍以上。五个棉纺织厂的八个布场中，有三个布场的“零分布”在11月份达到了42％以上。
    竞赛中，各厂都总结了自己的经验，进行了交流和观摩。天津第一棉纺织厂一布场由于在梭箱的底板上刻了一个槽，改进了留梭板的位置，这样在换梭子以后，拖在梭上的纱头就不会再回织到布里造成毛边等缺点。天津第四棉纺织厂学习了这项经验以后，又采取了及时检修剪纬刀等办法，使“零分布”由10月份的13.96％提高到44.79％。天津第一棉纺织厂一布场推广了天津第二棉纺织厂一布场消灭油污等小残疵的经验，并且改变了在一轴经纱还没用完的时候就打扫织布机等做法，大大减少了油污等小残疵，使11月份的“零分布”达到了43.75％。而在10月份，这个布场的“零分布”只占18.75％。
