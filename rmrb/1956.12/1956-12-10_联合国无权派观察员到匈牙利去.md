The United Nations Has No Right to Send Observers to Hungary
Chen Tiqiang, Standing Director of the China Political Science and Law Association

　　On the 4th of this month, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a proposal put forward by the United States and fourteen other countries. This proposal demanded that the Soviet and Hungarian governments comply with past United Nations "resolutions" and allow United Nations "observers" to enter Hungarian territory, "move freely within it," and report the results of their "investigations" to the Secretary-General. The resolution, in the tone of an ultimatum, demanded that the Soviet and Hungarian governments "notify the Secretary-General no later than December 7, 1956, that they agree to accept United Nations observers." In addition, the resolution also required the Secretary-General to make arrangements to immediately send its designated observers to Hungary and "other appropriate countries." The resolution violated basic international etiquette by calling the only legitimate government of Hungary the "Hungarian authorities," thereby exposing the imperialist countries' purpose of interfering in Hungary's internal affairs.

　　First of all, it should be pointed out that the Hungarian event, from beginning to end, was an internal affair of Hungary, and no United Nations body, whether the Security Council or the General Assembly, has the right to intervene. However, the imperialist countries, disregarding the provisions of the United Nations Charter, seized upon this relatively chaotic situation and manipulated the United Nations majority to make a major speculative deal against the Soviet Union and communism. From the outset, the Hungarian and Soviet representatives solemnly pointed out that the United Nations had no right to discuss this issue, and that such discussions and the "resolutions" passed as a result were violations of the United Nations Charter and therefore illegal. The Hungarian Acting Foreign Minister Sebes, in a telegram to the United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on November 12, emphasized that "the resolution of the problems occurring in Hungary is entirely within the legitimate jurisdiction of the Hungarian state, and therefore any resolution of the United Nations General Assembly concerning Hungary's domestic political situation is an interference in Hungary's internal affairs and a violation of Article 2, paragraph 7 of the Charter."

　　Article 2, paragraph 7 of the Charter stipulates as follows: "Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter; but this principle shall not prejudice the application of enforcement measures under Chapter VII." Whether all United Nations "resolutions" regarding the Hungarian event are legal depends on the interpretation of this article of the Charter.

　　To understand the true meaning of this article, it is necessary to study its origin. As everyone knows, this article of the Charter is derived from Article 15, paragraph 8 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, which stipulated that if one party to a dispute declares, and the Council confirms, that it arises from a matter "solely within the domestic jurisdiction of that party according to international law," the Council shall not make any recommendations for the resolution of that matter. The Dumbarton Oaks draft adopted the formula of the Covenant of the League of Nations, but this was modified at the San Francisco Conference. According to Mr. Gross, Legal Advisor to the U.S. Department of State, this was because "under present conditions, what a country does domestically always has at least some external impact" (Gross, "The Impact of the United Nations on Domestic Jurisdiction," U.S. Department of State Bulletin, February 29, 1948, pp. 259-267). If an event must "purely" be within the domestic jurisdiction of a country in order to be exempt from United Nations intervention, then there is very little that the United Nations cannot intervene in. The Charter used the words "essentially" in order to narrow the scope of United Nations intervention and give more protection to the sovereignty of nations.

　　American international lawyer Goodrich and Norwegian international lawyer Hambro, in their co-authored "Charter of the United Nations: Commentary and Documents" (1946 edition, pp. 74-76), also provided a restricted interpretation of the United Nations' power to intervene. They said: "If an event is ambiguous between international concern and domestic jurisdiction, it can be placed outside the authority of the United Nations organization if someone can claim that it is 'essentially' within the scope of domestic jurisdiction." Goodrich et al. also cited civil war as an example. They said: "According to this article, the United Nations organization has no power to intervene in any such internal struggle, even if its sole purpose is to restore peace. Such peace would be domestic, not international."

　　During the American Civil War, the United States government vehemently refuted the notion that foreign countries had the right to interfere in American internal disputes. The U.S. Congress passed a resolution in 1863 declaring that the United States must be "wholly exempt from foreign interference, which is the supreme right of independent nations" (U.S. Diplomatic Correspondence, 1864, Vol. II, pp. 813-814). During the same period, U.S. Secretary of State Seward repeatedly affirmed in a letter to the U.S. Minister to France that "the principle of foreign interference in our affairs, in any form or under any circumstances, cannot be accepted" (July 30, 1864, see Moore's "Digest of International Law," Vol. VII, p. 8).

　　It can be seen that the principle of non-interference in internal disputes is not only a principle of the United Nations Charter, but also a general principle of international law. If civil war is not allowed to be interfered with, then matters such as the restoration of domestic order by a legitimate government in a country like Hungary are certainly domestic jurisdictional events, and interference in such events would harm the sovereignty of that country. Austrian international lawyer Kelsen therefore concluded in his book "The Law of the United Nations":

　　"It can be presumed that if a matter is primarily related to the sovereignty of a country, then such an event is 'essentially' within the domestic jurisdiction of that country. Therefore, a country can refuse to submit this issue to settlement under the Charter and can deny the United Nations organization the right to intervene if such submission or intervention is incompatible with its sovereignty." According to Kelsen's view, this principle can be interpreted to mean that a country has not only no obligation to submit the issue to the Security Council under Article 37, paragraph 1, but also no obligation to accept intervention by the General Assembly under Article 10 or 11, or by the Security Council under Article 33, paragraph 2, 34, or 36, or even by the International Court of Justice under Article 36, paragraphs 2 to 6 of the Statute. Moreover, this can also be interpreted to mean that member states have no obligation to peacefully resolve disputes arising from domestic jurisdictional events in accordance with Article 2, paragraph 3. Article 2, paragraph 3 also clearly stipulates that member states are only obligated to resolve their "international" disputes by peaceful means.

　　In short, events that are essentially within domestic jurisdiction, even if they involve the use of force, do not become grounds for United Nations intervention. There has been debate in the past within the United Nations about what constitutes "matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state." The majority opinion is that if an event involves treaty obligations with foreign countries, it cannot be considered "essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the state," as was the case with the issue of South Africa's discrimination against people of Indian descent. In the Hungarian case, no country has been able to accuse Hungary of failing to fulfill its treaty obligations. The stationing of Soviet troops in Hungary in accordance with the Warsaw Pact to assist the Hungarian government in suppressing counter-revolutionary restoration actions did not constitute a dispute between the Soviet Union and Hungary. Another relevant treaty is the Treaty of Peace with Hungary. However, no one has accused Hungary of violating the treaty in this regard; on the contrary, Hungary is striving to implement the obligation stipulated in the treaty to prevent the resurgence of fascist forces. Western countries have no treaty rights to prevent it from doing so.

　　The above discussion shows that the drafters of the United Nations Charter intentionally demarcated an area that the United Nations could not interfere with. The so-called non-interference means that all United Nations bodies cannot interfere.

　　However, it must be pointed out here that the principle of non-interference in internal affairs in the first sentence of Article 2, paragraph 7 of the Charter cannot be viewed in isolation, but must be understood together with the second sentence. The second sentence stipulates that the above principle "shall not prejudice the application of enforcement measures under Chapter VII." In general, this sentence is interpreted strictly: "Enforcement measures under Chapter VII" refers to the measures stipulated in Articles 41 to 50 of Chapter VII. Goodrich wrote that the United Nations' power over events essentially within domestic jurisdiction is only the "enforcement measures" taken under Chapter VII to maintain or restore "international peace and security." That is to say, the United Nations can only take enforcement measures when domestic jurisdictional events become a threat or breach of international peace and security or become an act of aggression. Obviously, in this case, the event is no longer a domestic jurisdictional event, but itself becomes an international event. But here there are two points to note: First, only the Security Council has the right to take such enforcement measures; Second, such measures can only be applied to the international aspects of the problem and cannot be used to resolve domestic disputes. In the Hungarian issue, neither was it a decision made by the Security Council, nor did it involve a threat to or breach of international peace. Obviously, the second sentence of Article 7 is not applicable, and no one has ever advocated applying it in this way.

　　Perhaps some may ask: The Charter stipulates that the United Nations shall not interfere in domestic jurisdictional events, but what is "interference"? Is a suggestion interference? Is discussion "interference"? Some have argued that only "mandatory intervention" counts as "interference." Others believe that discussion does not count as "interference," while making suggestions and organizing investigative missions constitute "interference." Regardless of whether "discussion" and "suggestions" constitute interference, the General Assembly's resolution on December 4 is already an outright "mandatory intervention," which in every sense constitutes interference in Hungary. As the name implies, "suggestions" should not be coercive, but the proposal of the fourteen countries stipulated a time limit for the Soviet and Hungarian governments, threatening them to "agree" to accept the observers sent by the General Assembly. How can this be called a "suggestion"? This is an order, an ultimatum. Such "mandatory intervention" in internal affairs is unacceptable to any sovereign country with self-respect. The Hungarian government had originally expressed its welcome to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld to visit Hungary at an appropriate time in his capacity as head of the United Nations organization. However, after Hammarskjöld announced that he was conducting arrangements for the visit with the Hungarian Foreign Minister, the American group still forced the General Assembly to pass its proposal. This was a deliberate insult to the Hungarian government, deliberately forcing it to reject Hammarskjöld's visit on the proposed date. According to a Reuters report on December 5, India believes that Hungary's rejection of Hammarskjöld's request is a direct result of the General Assembly's adoption of the proposal of the fourteen countries. India believes that last night's vote was an ultimatum to the Hungarian government. This analysis by India is entirely correct.

　　From a legal point of view, the United Nations General Assembly has no power to send "observers," because Article 34 of the Charter expressly stipulates that only the Security Council has the right to conduct investigations. From a practical political perspective, in Hungary's current situation, the so-called "United Nations" observers are obviously also unacceptable. Since the event of October 23, the U.S. imperialist group has been constantly spreading rumors and slanders. Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov's speech at the United Nations General Assembly on November 19 already exposed this shameless rumor-mongering tactic with irrefutable facts. Now they hope to use the name of "United Nations observers" to go to Hungary and Hungary's neighboring countries to collect rumor-mongering materials in order to make their lies more deceptive. This is very obvious. Indian Prime Minister Nehru pointed out that the materials obtained in this way "will only provide a more exaggerated view of the situation," which is right to the point, exposing the imperialists' conspiracy and tricks.

　　Another intention of the U.S. imperialist group in passing the proposal of the fourteen countries is to use the fact that British and French imperialism was forced to withdraw its troops from Egypt after the failure of its aggression to create the impression that the Soviet Union and Hungary did not comply with the United Nations resolutions like Britain and France. This conspiracy must be exposed. The Hungarian issue and the Egyptian issue are two fundamentally different issues. The latter is an issue of an independent country being subjected to foreign armed aggression. One of the purposes of the United Nations is to stop such aggression, and intervention in such aggression events is the United Nations' unavoidable obligation; and the three countries, Britain, France, and Israel, as member states of the United Nations, voluntarily undertook the obligation to comply with the resolutions made by the United Nations in this regard. Therefore, the United Nations' intervention in the Egyptian issue is entirely appropriate, and the three countries, Britain, France, and Israel, are obligated to comply with the United Nations resolutions. On the other hand, the Hungarian issue is an issue of how an independent country restores its own domestic order. This is a country's internal affair, and the Charter clearly stipulates that it is a forbidden zone for the United Nations to interfere in. Now, the United Nations General Assembly, under the manipulation of the American group, has actually made a resolution to interfere, which is a violation of the Charter on which the United Nations General Assembly is based, and the Hungarian government certainly has no reason and no obligation to accept this kind of "misgovernment." Therefore, the fault for not complying with the United Nations resolutions lies not with Hungary, but with the United States. The spokesmen of imperialism's attempt to equate the Egyptian issue with the Hungarian issue is completely unfounded.

　　The clamor of imperialism on the Hungarian issue in the past was to divert people's attention from the Middle East issue, and today its purpose is still the same. The British and French aggressors have "announced" that they will withdraw their troops from Egypt, but when will they be completely withdrawn? What about the Suez Canal issue? What is the situation in Syria and Jordan? What about the issue of the United States joining the Baghdad Pact? This series of issues still needs close attention, and the clamor of the United States and Britain on the Hungarian issue is precisely to shift people's attention from these issues. On the other hand, although the issue of Hungary restoring order is entirely a matter of Hungary's internal affairs, the United States' instigation of rebellion and support for the revival of fascist forces in Eastern Europe is an international issue that the United Nations has every right to intervene in. If the United Nations wants to send observers to conduct on-the-spot investigations, then it should send observers to countries such as the United States, West Germany, and Austria to investigate how the United States' annual subversion appropriation of US$100 million is used, what the activities of the "Free Europe Committee" are, what the organization and activities of the "Free Europe" radio station are, and how the United States trains exiles and fascist agents from Eastern European countries to carry out subversive activities, etc. If the United Nations can do some beneficial things in these areas, it will greatly enhance its increasingly declining status in the minds of people all over the world.

　　联合国无权派观察员到匈牙利去
　　中国政治法律学会常务理事　陈体强
    本月4日，联合国大会通过了美国等十四国提出的提案，这个提案要求苏联和匈牙利政府遵从联合国过去的“决议”，和允许联合国“观察员”进入匈牙利领土，“在其中自由地往来”，并把他们的“调查”结果报告给秘书长。决议用最后通牒的口吻，要求苏匈两国“至迟不超过1956年12月7日要通知秘书长说他们同意接受联合国观察员”。此外，决议还要秘书长进行安排，以便把它指定的观察员立即派往匈牙利和“其他适当的国家”。决议违反了起码的国际礼貌，把匈牙利的唯一合法政府叫做“匈牙利当局”，从而暴露了帝国主义国家干涉匈牙利内政的目的。
    首先应当指出，匈牙利事件自始至终是匈牙利一国内部的事件，联合国任何机构，无论是安全理事会或是大会，都是无权过问的。但是，帝国主义国家不顾联合国宪章的规定，抓住了这个比较混乱的局势，操纵联合国的多数来大做一笔反苏反共的投机买卖。匈牙利和苏联代表一开始就严正地指出，联合国根本无权讨论这个问题，这种讨论以及由于讨论结果所通过的“决议”，都是违反联合国宪章的，因此都是非法的。匈牙利代理外长谢贝什11月12日致联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的电报强调指出：“解决匈牙利所发生的问题完全是在匈牙利国家内部的合法权限以内的事，因此，联合国大会有关匈牙利国内政局的任何决议都是对匈牙利内政的干涉，而且是违反宪章第二条第七款的规定的”。
    宪章的第二条第七款规定如下：“本宪章不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件，且并不要求会员国将该项事件依本宪章提请解决；但此项原则不妨碍第七章内执行办法之适用。”联合国关于匈牙利事件的一切“决议”是否合法，就要看对宪章这一款的解释而定。
    要了解这个条款的真正意义，就必须研究这一条款的来历。大家知道，宪章的这一款是从国际联盟盟约第十五条第八款脱胎出来的，盟约这一款规定：如果争端的一方宣称、并由行政院证实系由“按照国际法纯然属于该方的国内管辖之事件”所产生，行政院就不对该事件的解决提出建议。顿巴敦橡树园会议的草案采用了国际盟约的公式，但在旧金山会议上这点被修改了。按照美国国务院法律顾问葛罗斯所说，这是因为“在现在条件之下，一个国家国内所作的事情，总是至少会发生一些外部的影响的”（葛罗斯著：“联合国对国内管辖权的影响”，载1948年2月29日美国国务院公报，第259—267页）。如果必须一个事件“纯然”是属于一个国家国内管辖的事件，才能免除联合国的干涉，那就很少有什么事情联合国不能过问的了。宪章用了“在本质上”四个字，就是为了缩小联合国干涉的范围，对各国的主权给以更多的保护。
    美国国际法学家古德里治和挪威国际法学家汉布罗在合著的“联合国宪章释义与文件”（1946年版，第74—76页），对于联合国干涉的权力也作了限制的解释。他们说：“如果一个事件是在国际关切和国内管辖两可之间，它可以被置于联合国组织的权力之外，如果有人可以宣称它‘在本质上’是在国内管辖范围以内的话”。古德里治等还举出内战为例，他们说：“按照本条的规定，联合国组织没有权力干涉任何这种内部斗争，即使它的唯一目的是恢复和平。这种和平将是国内的，而不是国际的”。
    在美国南北战争时期，美国政府曾极力驳斥外国有干涉美国内争的权利的说法。美国国会于1863年通过了一项决议宣称：美国必须“完全免除外国干涉，这是独立国家的最高权利”（美国外交函牍，1864年，第二卷，第813—814页）。在同一时期，美国国务卿西华德致美国驻法公使的信中又一再肯定地宣称：“外国干涉我国事务的原则，无论以任何形式或在任何情况下，均不能接受”（1864年，7月30日，见慕尔编“国际法资料汇编”第七册，第八页）。
    由此可见，不得干涉一国内部斗争的事件，不仅是联合国宪章的原则，而且也是国际法的一般原则。内战尚且不容干涉，像在匈牙利那样仅仅涉及一国合法政府恢复国内秩序的问题，当然更是国内管辖事件，干涉这种事件，就会损害这个国家的主权。奥地利国际法学家凯尔逊在所著“联合国的法律”一书中因此作出如下结论：
  “可以推定：如果一件事是对一国的主权是主要的，这种事件就是‘在本质上’属于该国国内管辖之内。因此，一个国家可以拒绝把这问题按照宪章提交解决，并且可以否认联合国组织有权干涉，如果这种提交或干涉是和它的主权不相容的”。按照凯尔逊的意见，这个原则可以解释为国家不仅没有义务把问题按照第三十七条第一款提交安理会，而且也没有义务接受大会根据第十条或第十一条，或安理会根据第三十三条第二款、第三十四条或第三十六条，乃至国际法院根据规章第三十六条第二至六款而进行的干涉。而且这还可以解释为，会员国关于国内管辖事件所引起的争端没有义务按照第二条第三款进行和平解决。第二条第三款也很清楚地规定会员国只有义务以和平方法解决其“国际”争端。
    总之，凡是在本质上属于国内管辖的事件，即使涉及使用武力，也不成为联合国干涉的理由。关于什么是“在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件”，过去在联合国中曾经有过争论。多数的意见认为，如果一个事件牵涉到和外国的条约义务，就不能认为是“在本质上属于国家国内管辖之事件”，例如南非歧视印度血统的人的事件就是这样。在匈牙利案件中，没有任何国家能够指责匈牙利没有履行它的条约义务。苏联根据华沙条约而驻扎在匈牙利的军队协助匈牙利政府镇压反革命复辟的行动，并没有构成苏联和匈牙利之间的争端。另一个有关系的条约就是对匈和约。然而在这一方面并没有人指责匈牙利违反了条约；相反地，匈牙利正在努力执行这个条约所规定的制止法西斯势力复活的义务。西方国家并没有条约上的权利阻止它这样做。
    以上的讨论说明了联合国宪章的起草人是有意地划出联合国所不能干涉的一块领域。所谓不能干涉，是指联合国所有的机构都不能干涉。
    但是，在这里必须指出：宪章第二条第七款第一句关于不干涉内政的原则是不能孤立地看的，而是必须和第二句一起来了解。第二句规定上述原则“不得妨碍第七章内执行办法之适用”。一般对于这句话都是作严格解释：“第七章内执行办法”是指第七章内第四十一至第五十条所规定的办法。古德里治曾写道：联合国对于本质上属于国内管辖事件的权力，只是根据第七章为维持或恢复“国际和平与安全”而采取的“执行办法”。这就是说，只有国内管辖事件变成了对国际和平的威胁和破坏或成为侵略行为的时候，联合国才能采取执行办法。很显然的，在这种情况下，这种事件就不再成国内管辖事件，而本身变成一个国际事件了。但是在这里有两点必须注意的：一、只有安理会有权采取这种执行办法；二、这种办法只能适用于问题的国际方面，而不能用来解决国内的争端。在匈牙利问题上，既不是安理会作出的决定，又没有涉及对国际和平的威胁与破坏。显然第七款第二句是不适用的，也从来没有人主张这样适用过。
    也许有人要问：宪章规定联合国对国内管辖事件不得进行干涉，但是什么是“干涉”？建议是不是干涉？讨论是不是“干涉”？曾经有人认为只有“命令式的干预”才算“干涉”。也有人认为讨论不算“干涉”，而提出建议和组织调查团就构成“干涉”。姑且不论“讨论”和“建议”是否构成干涉的问题，联大12月4日的决议已经是一种不折不扣的“命令式的干预”，无论从任何意义来讲都是构成了对匈牙利的干涉。顾名思义，“建议”不应该带有强迫性的，而十四国提案对苏匈两国政府规定了时限，威胁着要它们必须“同意”接受联大所派遣的观察员。这怎么能叫“建议”呢？这是命令，是最后通牒。对于内政的这种“命令式的干预”，是任何具有自尊心的主权国家所不能接受的。匈牙利政府原曾表示欢迎联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德以联合国组织首长的身份在适当的时期到匈牙利去访问。然而在哈马舍尔德宣布了他正和匈牙利外交部长进行关于访问的安排之后，美国集团仍然强迫大会通过了它的提案，这是对匈牙利政府的故意的侮辱，故意迫使它拒绝哈马舍尔德在拟议的日期进行访问。根据12月5日路透社的报道，印度认为，匈牙利拒绝哈马舍尔德的请求是联大通过十四国提案的直接结果，印度认为昨晚的表决是对匈牙利政府的最后通牒。印度的这种分析是完全正确的。
    从法律观点来看，联合国大会根本没有权力派遣“观察员”，因为宪章第三十四条明文规定只有安理会有权进行调查。从实际政治方面考虑，在匈牙利目前情形之下，所谓“联合国”的观察员显然也是不能接受的。美帝国主义集团自从10月23日事件发生以来一直不断地进行造谣污蔑。苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫11月19日在联大的发言，已经用无可辩驳的事实揭发了这种无耻造谣的伎俩。现在他们希望利用“联合国观察员”的名义到匈牙利和匈牙利的邻国去搜集造谣材料，以便使他们的谎言取得更大的欺骗性。这是十分明显的。印度尼赫鲁总理指出，这样取得的材料，“只会提供关于局势更加夸张的看法”，这正是一语破的，戳穿了帝国主义的阴谋把戏。
    美帝国主义集团通过十四国提案的另外的一个用心，便是要利用英法帝国主义在埃及侵略失败被迫撤兵的事实，来造成一种印象，好像苏联和匈牙利没有和英法一样遵从联合国的决议。这种阴谋是必须揭穿的。匈牙利问题和埃及问题是两个本质上完全不同的问题。后者是一个独立国家受到外国武装侵略的问题。联合国设立的目的之一正是为了制止这种侵略，对这种侵略事件的干涉是联合国责无旁贷的义务；而英、法、以三国，作为联合国的会员国，自愿地承担了遵从联合国在这方面所作的决议的义务。因此联合国对埃及问题的干涉是完全应当的，而英、法、以三国是有义务遵从联合国的决议的。在另一方面，匈牙利问题是一个独立国家用什么方法恢复它自己国内秩序的问题。这是一国的内政问题，宪章明白规定是联合国所不能插足的禁区。现在联合国大会在美国集团操纵之下竟然作出了干涉的决议，这是联合国大会违反了它所据以存在的宪章，匈牙利政府当然没有理由也没有义务接受它的这种“乱政”。因此不遵从联合国决议的过错不在匈牙利，而是在美国。帝国主义的代言人企图把埃及问题和匈牙利问题相提并论混为一谈，是完全没有根据的。
    帝国主义在匈牙利问题上的叫嚣，过去是为了转移人们对中东问题的注意，今天它的目的仍然是这样。英法侵略者是
  “宣布”了要从埃及撤兵，但是几时撤完？苏伊士运河的问题怎样？叙利亚和约旦方面的局势怎样？美国参加巴格达条约的问题又怎样？这一系列问题仍然需要严密注视，而美英在匈牙利问题上的喊闹正是要移转人们对这些问题的视线。在另一方面，匈牙利恢复秩序问题虽然完全是匈牙利的内政问题，但是美国策动叛乱，支援法西斯势力在东欧的复活，却是联合国所有权过问的国际问题。如果联合国要想派观察员实地调查的话，那末它就应当派观察员去美国、西德、奥地利等国去调查一下美国每年一亿美元的颠覆拨款如何使用，“自由欧洲委员会”的活动情形如何，“自由欧洲”电台的组织和活动是怎样的，美国如何训练东欧各国的流亡分子和法西斯特务来进行颠覆活动等等。如果联合国能在这些方面作些有益的事情，它在全世界人民心目中将会大大地提高它的日益没落的地位。
