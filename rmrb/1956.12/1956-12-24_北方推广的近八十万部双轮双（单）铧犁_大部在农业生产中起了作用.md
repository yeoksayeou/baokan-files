Xinhua News Agency, 22nd. Over 790,000 double-wheeled double (single) furrow plows promoted this year in the dry farming areas of the Yellow River and Huai River basins and in Northeast China have reached a utilization rate of 80% to 90%. Each double (single) furrow plow is responsible for an average cultivated area of about 150 to 190 mu. In many areas, the average cultivated area per double (single) furrow plow has more than doubled compared to last year.

According to typical surveys conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture at 23 locations in Northeast China, the Yellow River and Huai River plains, and Southern paddy field areas, the use of double (single) furrow plows not only improves efficiency but also enhances the quality of cultivation, leading to varying degrees of increased crop yields for general crops.

The double-wheeled double (single) furrow plows promoted this year in the Yellow River and Huai River basins and Northeast China account for more than three-quarters of the total number promoted nationwide, and most of these plows have played a role. This is mainly because these areas have a certain foundation for using double (single) furrow plows, soil conditions are generally suitable, and much work has been done in promotion, experimentation, demonstration, and technical instruction. In some other areas, due to the lack of timely efforts in these aspects, or the models of double (single) furrow plows promoted not meeting the requirements, many plows have not played a role or have not been used at all. In provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian, the utilization rate is also relatively low because the modification and technical problems of double (single) furrow plows, as well as issues with animal power, have not been well resolved.

### 北方推广的近八十万部双轮双（单）铧犁  大部在农业生产中起了作用

    北方推广的近八十万部双轮双（单）铧犁
    大部在农业生产中起了作用
    新华社22日讯　今年在黄河和淮河流域平原旱作地区以及东北地区推广的七十九万多部双轮双（单）铧犁，使用率达到百分之八十到九十，每部双（单）铧犁平均负担的耕地面积都在一百五十亩到一百九十亩左右。还有不少地区双（单）铧犁的平均耕地面积都比去年提高一倍以上。
    据农业部在东北地区、黄河和淮河平原、南方水田地区等二十三个点的典型调查，证明使用双（单）铧犁不但效率高，而且耕作质量好，一般农作物都得到不同程度的增产。
    黄河、淮河流域和东北地区今年推广的双轮双（单）铧犁占全国推广数的四分之三以上，而且这些犁大部分都发挥了作用。这主要是由于这些地区使用双（单）铧犁有一定基础，土壤条件一般都比较适合，同时在推广、试验、示范和技术传授等方面又进行了许多工作。还有部分地区由于这些工作做得不及时，或者推广的双（单）铧犁的型号不合要求，使许多犁没有发挥作用，甚至根本没有使用。在广东、广西、湖南、湖北、江西、浙江、福建等省，也由于双（单）铧犁的改装和技术问题以及畜力等问题没有很好地解决，因此使用率比较低。
