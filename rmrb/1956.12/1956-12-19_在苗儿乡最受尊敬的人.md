　　In April 1953, a car bumped along a mountain road in Longshan County, Hunan. Among the passengers was an old soldier in a military uniform, his face weathered by travel. He gazed intently at the green mountains outside the car, sometimes frowning, sometimes smiling.

　　This passenger was a veteran soldier who had just returned from the front lines. His name was Zhang Quanming. He was thinking: how can I bring socialism to my hometown, and turn this poor mountain area into a place of abundant wealth? He was thinking about how to use his subsidy to help his fellow villagers develop production? He silently pondered everything along the way. But he didn't think about where he himself would live. After all, he didn't have half a house in his hometown!

　　Zhang Quanming was a veteran soldier with twenty-two years of Party membership, who had fought in the army for twenty-one years. He went through the 25,000-li Long March, the entire War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. He served as a soldier, platoon leader, acting battalion commander, and transportation section chief in the army. When he returned home, he was already an old man in his sixties.

　　The news of Zhang Quanming's return to his hometown stirred Miaoer Township. The villagers respected him, cared for him, and were determined to let this old Red Army soldier, who had struggled for the people for half his life, spend his happy later years in his hometown. However, Zhang Quanming did not think so. He said that he had returned to his hometown to build a new life together with his fellow villagers. The township government allocated a room for him. When he learned that it was a classroom in the primary school, he firmly declined. He said that he could not delay the children's studies, and that he could settle down anywhere. The masses wanted to help him build a new house, but he refused even more, insisting on building a simple little house.

　　From the moment he got off the car, Zhang Quanming began to engage in labor production.

　　In June 1954, the crops grew so lush that they blocked out the sky. People looked at the green satin-like seedlings and couldn't help but feel happy. But unexpectedly, insects appeared.

　　Zhang Quanming led the villagers to catch insects, spreading lime in the fields all day long. The sun made his head dizzy, and the lime water broke his skin on his feet, causing yellow liquid to seep out. He still encouraged the masses to work hard. After a battle, the insects were wiped out. In the autumn, when the villagers looked at the heavy ears of rice and carried back the golden grain, they couldn't help but happily talk about Zhang Quanming's contribution.

　　Winter came. The winter in the mountains was particularly cold. Every day, when everyone in the township was still sleeping, someone would carry a hoe up the mountain to reclaim wasteland. This was Zhang Quanming again. The township head persuaded him to rest, but he said, "I can't stay idle, I feel comfortable when I'm working hard." In twenty days, he braved the frost and cold wind to open up a large piece of wasteland, and turned six pieces of wasteland into paddy fields. These fields yielded 750 jin of grain in 1955.

　　Old habits were a major obstacle to promoting advanced experiences. When the government called for early rice planting, the masses said, "Don't be busy in February Qingming, plant rice early in March Qingming." This year was February Qingming, and the masses were unwilling to start. Zhang Quanming patiently explained the benefits of early rice planting to the masses, and took the lead in planting rice in the fields. Seeing him like that, everyone actively started working. Thanks to early rice planting, insect pests were prevented this year. The government called for improving farming techniques, and he took the lead in intensive cultivation, even and dense planting, and rational fertilization. Some people worried about him, but the facts answered these people. His fields grew a good crop of rice, and the harvest increased by 30%.

　　The stumbling block to promoting advanced experiences was thus removed by Zhang Quanming.

　　In 1953, there was not a single mutual aid team in Miaoer Township. After Zhang Quanming returned to his hometown, he and eight households, including Zhang Zhonglin, organized the first mutual aid team. After the autumn harvest, two of the original eight grain-deficient households had surplus grain. The facts educated those individual farmers, and twenty-one mutual aid teams quickly emerged throughout the township.

　　The road to cooperativization was naturally not so easy. This required hard work. After Chairman Mao's report on the question of agricultural cooperation was published, the poor peasants and activists of Miaoer Township were determined to organize agricultural cooperatives; there were also people who hesitated and prepared to wait and see. As for the cadres, as Chairman Mao said, they had "infinite worries," believing that the mass base was poor, and planned to secretly try out a few households. But Zhang Quanming advocated doing it openly and on a large scale. He said, "It is not against the law to engage in socialism, why should we do it secretly!" While resolutely struggling against conservative thinking, he used real people and real events from the old liberated areas to publicize to the masses. The masses' concerns slowly disappeared, and fifty-four of the village's sixty-three households finally requested to join the cooperative.

　　On the 14th day of the first lunar month, the first agricultural production cooperative in Miaoer Township was born. Zhang Quanming was elected as the cooperative's political instructor.

　　Last year, one day Zhang Quanming was cutting grass in Yanshiguo (Rock Ditch), when a spring cave there caught his attention. He thought, if we could send this water to the fields, wouldn't the dry land be turned into paddy fields? Zhang Quanming couldn't sleep for several nights thinking about this. He told the township chairman Long Shunfu about his idea, and got Old Long's agreement. Old Long instructed him to make a plan immediately.

　　Zhang Quanming drew up the engineering plan overnight, and when it was announced at the founding meeting of the agricultural cooperative this year, it was approved by everyone. The meeting immediately made a resolution, and construction began the next day. According to Zhang Quanming's prior arrangements, everyone started working separately, and in five days they built a ditch more than one li long. The cooperative's nineteen mu of dry wasteland has since been turned into good paddy fields.

　　Before everyone had brushed off the mud from digging the new ditch, they began to repair the old ditches. At this time, Zhang Quanming was even busier, surveying routes, checking quality, ... never stopping all day long.

　　Soon, twenty-six old ditches were repaired. The leaking ditches no longer leaked. The cooperative's sixty-six mu of paddy fields had a sufficient supply of water during droughts, eliminating the threat of drought.

　　Zhang Quanming always considered the interests of the broad masses, worked diligently for three years as if it was one day, and won the high trust of cadres and the masses. The villagers were willing to talk to him about anything on their minds. Village cadres also came to him to discuss solutions when they encountered difficulties. He became the most respected person in Miaoer Township. (Attached picture)

    在苗儿乡最受尊敬的人
  　解供
    1953年4月，汽车在湖南龙山县山间公路上颠簸前进。乘客中有一位身着军服满面风尘的老人。他凝神地望着车外的青山，时而皱起眉头，时而眉开眼笑。
    这位旅客是刚从前线复员回来的一位老军人。他名叫张全明。他在想：怎样才能把社会主义带给家乡，使这个贫穷的山区变成遍山财富的地带？他在想怎样运用自己的资助金，帮助乡亲们发展生产？一路上他默默地盘算了一切。可是他就没有想到自己住的地方。要知道他在故乡并没有半间房子呀！
    张全明是一个有二十二年党龄，在部队中转战了二十一年的老军人。他经过二万五千里长征和全部的抗日战争、解放战争和抗美援朝战争，在军队中当过战士、连长、代理营长和运输科长。当他回家的时候，已经是六十来岁的老人了。
    张全明回乡的消息震动了苗儿乡。乡亲们尊敬他、关怀他，决心让这个为人民奋斗了半辈子的老红军战士在家乡安度幸福的晚年。但是，张全明不这么想，他说他回乡来是要和乡亲们一道建设新生活的。乡政府给他拨出了一间房子。他得知这是小学校的课室以后，坚决谢绝了。他说不能耽误孩子们学习，自己随便找个地方就可以安身。群众要帮他盖新房，他更不肯，坚持着修了一个简陋的小房。
    从打下车以后，张全明就开始了劳动生产。
    1954年6月，庄稼长得遮天盖地。人们看着绿缎子似的禾苗，止不住心头高兴。可是出人意外：起虫了。
    张全明带领乡亲们捉虫，整天在田里撒石灰。太阳晒得他头昏脑胀，石灰水浸破了他的脚皮，流出了黄水。他仍然鼓励群众紧张地工作。一场斗争过后，虫子被消灭光了。秋天，乡亲们望着沉甸甸的稻穗，挑回金黄的谷子时，都不免高兴地谈论着张全明的功劳。
    冬天来了。山里的冬天特别寒冷。每天，当全乡的人都还睡早觉的时候，就有人背着镢头上山开荒去了。这又是张全明。乡长劝他休息，他说：“我闲不住，劳动紧了倒舒服。”二十天里他冒着寒霜冷风开出了一大块荒地，并把六块荒地变成了水田。这些田在1955年收了七百五十斤谷子。
    旧习惯是推广先进经验的重要障碍。当政府号召提早插秧时，群众说：“二月清明不要忙，三月清明早下秧。”这年是二月清明，群众不肯动手。张全明一面苦口婆心地向群众解释提早插秧的好处，一面带头下田插秧。群众看他那样，大家也都积极干起来了。由于提早插秧，这年防止了虫害。政府号召改进耕作技术，他带头精耕细作，均匀密植，合理施肥。有人替他担心，可事实给这些人作了回答。他田里长了一片好禾，收成比往年增加了30％。
    推广先进经验的绊脚石就这样被张全明搬掉了。
    1953年苗儿乡还没有一个互助组。张全明回乡以后，和张中林等八户组织了第一个互助组。秋收过后，原来这八户缺粮户有两家有了余粮。事实教育了那些单干的农民，全乡很快出现了二十一个互助组。
    走完合作化的路程自然不是那么容易。这需要艰苦的工作。毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告公布以后，苗儿乡的贫农和积极分子一心要组织农业社；也还有人犹豫不决，准备看看再说。干部呢，正如毛主席所说的，他们存在着“无穷的忧虑”，认为群众基础差，打算偷偷地搞几户试办一下。但是张全明却主张大张旗鼓地搞，他说：“搞社会主义又不犯法，为什么要偷偷地干呢！”他一面坚决向保守思想斗争，一面用老解放区的真人真事向群众宣传。群众的顾虑慢慢消除了，全村六十三户终于有五十四户要求入社了。
    正月14日，苗儿乡第一个农业生产合作社诞生了。张全明被选为社里的政治指导员。
    去年，有一天张全明在岩石沟割草，这里的一个泉洞引起了他的注意。他想，把这股水送到地里，旱地不就变成稻田了吗？张全明为想这事，好几个夜晚没睡着觉。他把这想法告诉乡主席龙顺富，得到了老龙的同意。老龙嘱咐他马上做出计划。
    张全明连夜订出了工程计划，今年正月，在农业社成立大会上一公布，就得到了大家的同意；大会当场作出决议，第二天便动工了。按照张全明事先的安排，大家分头动手，五天时间就修成了一里多长的水沟。社里十九亩旱荒地从此变成了很好的水田。
    大家挖新沟的泥土还没拂下，就开始整修旧沟的劳动。这时张全明更忙了，勘测路线啦，检查质量啦，……整日不停。
    不久，二十六条旧沟修好了。漏水的沟再也不漏了。社里六十六亩稻田在天旱时有了充分的水量供应，解除了旱灾的威胁。
    张全明处处为广大群众的利益着想，三年如一日地辛勤劳动，获得了干部和群众的高度信任，乡亲们有啥心思都愿找他说。村干部有什么困难也来找他商量解决。他成了苗儿乡最受尊敬的人。（附图片）
