    Jiangsu Province's Agricultural Cooperatives Fully Promote Democracy and Hold Good Membership Representative Conferences After the "Democratic Management of Cooperatives" Discussion
    (Our Newspaper, Nanjing) Following the "democratic management of cooperatives" discussion, agricultural production cooperatives in Jiangsu Province have universally convened membership representative conferences.

    At the beginning of this year, when formulating cooperative charters, agricultural production cooperatives in Jiangsu Province made provisions for holding regular membership meetings or membership representative conferences. However, due to the lack of understanding of "democratic management of cooperatives" among cooperative cadres, these provisions were generally not earnestly implemented. Since the launch of the "democratic management of cooperatives" discussion at the end of June this year, cooperative cadres have gradually realized the importance of adhering to the mass line in running cooperatives. In mid-September, the Rural Work Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting to deploy further efforts in "democratic management of cooperatives." The meeting emphasized the need to educate Party members and cadres to adopt the working methods of the mass line, fully promote democracy, and rely on the collective wisdom of the branch and cooperative members to discuss and decide on major issues of the cooperative. It required agricultural cooperatives to implement production democracy, distribution democracy, labor quota democracy, financial expenditure democracy, and technical leadership democracy. The meeting also pointed out that the key to achieving these democracies lies in holding good membership meetings (for small cooperatives) or membership representative conferences (for large cooperatives), requiring cooperatives in all regions to convene membership meetings or membership representative conferences without exception.

    Party committees at all levels attached great importance to holding membership representative conferences of cooperatives in conjunction with the central tasks of rural areas. For example, since September, 2,886 out of 3,676 cooperatives in the Nantong Special Zone have convened membership representative conferences. From October, 5,608 cooperatives in the Huaiyin Special Zone began convening membership representative conferences in conjunction with the year-end income distribution work to further implement the policy of democratic cooperative management.

    Many facts show that the convening of membership representative conferences has allowed representatives to reflect the opinions and demands of the vast majority of members and to bring the policies and tasks of the Party and the government to the broad masses. This has strengthened the connection between cooperative cadres and members, the Party and the masses, and transformed the policies of the Party and the government into the conscious actions of the masses.

    Summarized the Superiority of Cooperation
    Strengthened the Confidence of the Masses in Running Cooperatives

    The membership representative conferences convened by cooperatives in various regions summarized the advantages shown in the first year of cooperation and strengthened the confidence of the masses in running cooperatives well. Zhaiqiao Cooperative in Jiangdu County calculated three accounts when summarizing the year's work: ① Production increase account: The cooperative converted more than 400 mu of dry land into paddy fields this year, increasing grain production by more than 96,000 jin compared to last year's soybean planting; ② Income comparison account: Last year, 139 households in the cooperative lacked grain during the bumper harvest, while this year only 64 households lacked grain, a decrease of 46% compared to last year; ③ Grain income and expenditure account: The cooperative harvested a total of more than 1,689,000 jin of grain. After deducting public grain and seeds, the actual retained grain was more than 900,000 jin. Although affected by disasters, the retained grain was still more than last year. Representatives affirmed the achievements, distinguished right from wrong, and enhanced their confidence in improving production next year during the discussion. After holding a good representative conference, representatives of the Dengta Cooperative in Rudong County publicized the summary and resolutions of the conference, which dispelled Yao Shunfa's concerns about suffering losses and wanting to withdraw from the cooperative. The next day, he mobilized eight members to sort out manure buckets and manage waterwheels. Seeing that the cooperative's production was indeed higher than the mutual aid team's, the members of Liu Shaoquan's team pooled 40 yuan to buy fertilizer and top-dress the contracted fields. Many cooperatives saw moving examples of members loving the cooperative as their home after the representative conference.

    Implement the Principle of Diligence and Thrift in Running Cooperatives
    Adopt Measures to Eradicate Waste

    The membership representative conferences of agricultural cooperatives in various regions reviewed the implementation of the principle of diligence and thrift in running cooperatives and promptly adopted various measures to eradicate waste. Representatives of the fifth and eighth brigades of Happiness No. 1 Cooperative in Nantong County criticized the cooperative for not storing summer grain well and suggested that the cooperative use the 37 vacant rooms near the river with drying yards as warehouses to store autumn grain and cotton. The management committee adopted this suggestion, saving more than 600 yuan in rent. Representatives of Zhangwan Cooperative in Donghai County criticized the leading cadres at the membership representative conference for improper work assignments, which delayed farming time and wasted more than 10,000 jin of seeds. They also exposed the cooperative's extravagance in building more than 50 houses at once. After the meeting, the management committee revised the cash expenditure system to ensure careful calculation in the future. Representatives of Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Sihong County mentioned that more than 100 yuan was wasted in building pigsties due to chaotic division of labor. The management committee also adopted a unified leadership and division of labor approach after the meeting and established an inspection system to prevent waste.

    Promote the Mass Line
    Strengthen Collective Leadership

    The membership representative conference educated cooperative cadres on the importance of the working methods of the mass line and strengthened collective leadership, making cooperative cadres realize the harm of subjectivism and bureaucratic leadership styles. In the Sanyu District of Nantong County, representatives of 23 agricultural cooperatives raised more than 710 opinions at the meeting. Many cadres said, "This fact has educated us to realize that relying on the masses and consulting with them on everything is the only way to run the cooperative well." At the same time, they felt that with the support of the broad masses in running the cooperative, their work enthusiasm was even higher. In Xingren District, Shuanglou Township, the number of brigade leaders who were active in their work and valued the opinions of the members increased from 13 before the meeting to 24 after the meeting. The cadres of Taian Agricultural Cooperative in Gaochun County had a more serious subjective and compulsory command style, and the members said negatively, "The cooperative cadres are the bosses, and we are the employees." Before the meeting, the Party branch organized cadres above the level of production team leader to discuss the question of "Should we follow the mass line in running the cooperative? How much loss has taking everything into our own hands brought us?" in connection with reality. Through repeated discussions, the cadres realized the truth that "two heads are better than one." At the membership representative conference, the representatives used concrete examples of business management to illustrate the harm of subjectivism in the cooperative cadres' leadership of production. The cadres also took the initiative to conduct self-criticism. After the meeting, cooperative cadres and members generally reported that the cooperative had experienced good production, good management, and good relations. At the membership representative conferences of many cooperatives, the representatives exposed the fact that the cooperative's management committee was just a formality and that many major issues were decided by the cooperative director and accountant individually. Therefore, the management committees of many cooperatives studied the issue of strengthening collective leadership to ensure that they strictly followed the cooperative charter and that major issues were discussed and decided by the management committee.

    Improved the Relationship Between Cadres and Members
    Some cooperative cadres also became more concerned about the lives of the members than before. After listening to the representatives' opinions at the membership representative conference of Youyi Agricultural Cooperative in Taixian County requesting help to solve the livelihood problems of needy households, the cooperative cadres not only adopted the method of distributing grain as members worked, but also properly arranged their household sideline occupations. For example, members Wang Rongkui and two other households each had six or seven people and few laborers, but they all knew how to make fishing nets. The cooperative lent them 5 yuan each to buy hemp and make nets. The cooperative also arranged for some members to catch fish and crabs and pre-borrowed some grain for them, deciding that they would repay it in installments from their sideline income. Chen Guohong, the leader of the sixth production team of Dengta Agricultural Cooperative in Rudong County, reviewed his lack of consultation with members at the meeting, expressed his intention to overcome his shortcomings, and received the understanding of the members. Seeing that he was very busy with his work, member Xu Mingshan took the initiative to work in the cotton field without waiting for an assignment and afterwards proposed a method of increasing production to the team leader. After the representative conference, 69 team leaders in this cooperative promoted a democratic style and had close relationships with the members, which was praised by the members.

    The Membership Representative Conference Promoted Work
    Shuguang Cooperative in Tongshan County convened a membership representative conference centered on distribution. The distribution plan was revised through discussion, and a more correct approach was taken in arranging the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual. Long-standing problems such as cadre subsidies, the burden of equity funds, and the repayment of discounted payments for cash crops were also resolved to everyone's satisfaction based on the cooperative's income situation. When discussing production, Hongqi Cooperative in Yancheng County arranged agriculture and sideline occupations, planned winter production, and turned winter idleness into winter busyness. In addition, preliminary arrangements were also made for next year's production plan. In the disaster-stricken agricultural cooperatives, the confidence of the masses in production and self-salvation has gradually increased through the convening of representative conferences. Lixu Cooperative in Huaian County implemented the policy of production and self-salvation at the membership representative conference and summarized the experience of overcoming the disaster. After the meeting, Party members and cadres took the lead and led the members to formulate production and self-salvation plans. Currently, this cooperative has engaged in transportation, fishing, duck hunting, and other sideline occupations, earning more than 700 yuan in twenty days.

    Full Preparation and Promoting Democracy are the Keys to Holding a Good Representative Conference
    The reason why the cooperatives that have already held membership representative conferences have achieved good results is mainly due to grasping two key links: full preparation before the meeting and full promotion of democracy during the meeting. Preparation before the meeting, such as publicizing the significance and role of the membership representative conference, deliberating and electing representatives, and collecting members' opinions and sorting out proposals, are all processes for improving the "democratic cooperative management" awareness of cooperative cadres and members. Whether democracy can be fully promoted at the meeting is the key to determining the success or failure of the meeting. Many representatives had concerns before the meeting, fearing that raising too many opinions would lead to retaliation from cooperative cadres. However, if cooperative cadres can boldly and actively expose the shortcomings and mistakes in their work, they will dispel the representatives' doubts and allow them to speak freely. (Liu Yan)

    江苏省各地农业社在“民主办社”大讨论以后
　　充分发扬民主开好社员代表大会
    本报南京讯　江苏省各地农业生产合作社，在“民主办社”大讨论后，普遍召开社员代表大会。
    今年年初，江苏省各地农业生产合作社在制定社章的时候，都作了定期召开社员大会或社员代表大会的规定；但由于社干部对
  “民主办社”的认识不足，一般都没有认真执行。自今年6月底展开“民主办社”大讨论以后，社干部才逐步认识到办社要走群众路线的重要性。9月中旬，中共江苏省委农村工作部召开了会议，布置进一步开展“民主办社”的工作。会议强调要教育党员、干部采取群众路线的工作方法，充分发扬民主，依靠支部和社员群众的集体智慧来讨论和决定社的重大问题；要求农业社实行生产民主、分配民主、劳动定额民主、财务开支民主、技术领导民主。会议并指出实现这些民主的关键在于开好社员大会（小社）或社员代表大会（大社），要求各地合作社必须无例外地召开社员大会或社员代表大会。
    各级党委对结合农村中心工作，开好合作社的社员代表大会，都非常重视。如南通专区从9月份以来，全专区三千六百七十六个合作社中，就有二千八百八十六个社召开了社员代表大会。淮阴专区五千六百零八个合作社从10月份开始，结合做好全年收益分配工作，召开社员代表大会，进一步贯彻民主办社的方针。
    很多事实表明，由于召开了社员代表大会，代表们反映了广大社员的意见和要求，又把党和政府的政策和任务带到广大社员群众中去。这就加强了社干部和社员、党和群众的联系，使党和政府的政策，变成群众自觉的行动。
    总结了合作化的优越性
　  坚定了群众办社的信心
    各地合作社召开的社员代表大会，总结了合作化第一年所显示出来的优越性，坚定了群众办好合作社的信心。江都县翟桥合作社在总结全年工作时，算了三笔账：①增产账：全社今年旱田改水田四百多亩，较去年种豆子共增产九万六千多斤粮食；②收入对比账：去年丰收时全社有一百三十九户缺粮，今年只有六十四户缺粮，较去年下降46％；③粮食收入支出账：全社共收粮一百六十八万九千多斤，除去公粮、种子，实际留粮九十多万斤，虽然受灾，但留粮还比去年多。代表们在讨论时肯定了成绩，分清了是非，提高了搞好明年生产的信心。如东县灯塔社在开好代表大会以后，代表们宣传了大会的总结和决议，使原来怕吃亏要退社的姚顺发消除了顾虑。第二天他一早就动员八个社员整理粪桶和收管水车。刘少泉领导的小队的社员看到合作社确比互助组增产，大家就凑了四十元去买肥料，到包产的田里去追肥。不少社在代表大会以后，出现了社员爱社如家的动人事例。
    贯彻勤俭办社方针
    采取根绝浪费措施
    各地农业社的社员代表大会，检查了贯彻勤俭办社方针的情况，及时采取了根绝浪费的各项措施。南通县幸福一社第五和第八大队的代表，批评社里夏粮没有保管好，并建议社里利用靠河边有晒场的三十七间空房做仓库，保管好秋粮和棉花。管委会采纳了这个建议，节约了租金六百多元。东海县张湾社的代表在社员代表大会上批评领导干部派工不当，贻误农时，浪费了一万多斤种子；还揭发了社里讲究排场，一次盖了五十多间房子的事情。会后，管委会重新修订了现金的支出制度，保证以后要精打细算。泗洪县红星农业社的代表谈到社内盖猪圈由于分工混乱，浪费了一百多元。管委会也在会后采取了统一领导、分工负责的工作方法，并订出防止浪费的检查制度。
        提倡群众路线
        加强集体领导
    社员代表大会，教育了社干部重视群众路线的工作方法，加强了集体领导，使社干部认识到主观主义和官僚主义领导作风的害处。南通县三余区二十三个农业合作社，代表们在会上共提出了七百一十多条意见。不少干部说：“这一事实教育我们认识到依靠群众、有事和群众商量，才能把社办好。”同时，他们感到办社有广大群众的支持，工作积极性也更高了。兴仁区双楼乡七个社，会前工作积极、重视社员意见的大队长有十三人，会后增加到二十四人。高淳县太安农业社的干部有较严重的主观主义、强迫命令作风，社员消极地说“社干是老板，我们是伙计”。党支部在会前组织生产小队长以上的干部，联系实际讨论了“办社要不要走群众路线？包办代替给我们带来了多大损失？”的问题。通过反复讨论，干部认识到“一人不如二人智”的道理。在社员代表大会上，代表们通过经营管理上的具体事例，说明社干部领导生产上的主观主义的危害性；干部也主动地作了检讨。会后，社干部、社员普遍反映社里出现了生产好、管理好、关系好的现象。在许多社的社员代表大会上，代表们揭发了合作社的管理委员会流于形式，许多重大问题都由社长和会计个人决定的事实。因此，许多合作社的管理委员会都研究了加强集体领导的问题，保证严格依据社章办事，重大问题由管理委员会讨论决定。
  　改善了干部与社员的关系
    有的社干部对社员的生活疾苦也比以前更关心了。泰县友谊农业社的社干部在社员代表会上听取了代表们要求帮助解决困难户生活问题的意见以后，不但采取了社员随做随分粮的办法，还妥善地安排了他们的家庭副业。如社员王荣奎等两户，每家都有六、七人，劳力少，但都会结鱼网；社里就借给他们每户五元，买麻结网。社里并安排有些社员捕捉鱼蟹，还预借一部分粮食给他们，决定由他们在副业收入内分期归还。如东县灯塔农业社第六生产队队长陈国洪在会上检讨了办事缺乏和社员商量的精神，表示要克服缺点，得到了社员的谅解。社员徐明山看到他工作很忙，没有等分派就主动到棉田里去工作，事后并向小队长提出增产的办法。在代表大会以后，这个社有六十九个小队长发扬了民主作风，同社员的关系亲密无间，受到了社员的赞扬。
　  社员代表大会推动了工作
    铜山县曙光合作社以分配为中心召开了社员代表大会，分配方案经过讨论修正，在安排国家、集体、个人三者之间的关系方面，有了较正确的处理办法。长期没有解决的干部补贴、股份基金负担及经济作物折价款的偿还等问题，也根据社的收入情况，做出了大家满意的决议。盐城县红旗社在讨论生产时，安排了农业和副业，规划了冬季生产，把冬闲变为冬忙。此外，对明年的生产计划也初步作了安排。在灾区的农业社，通过召开代表大会，群众生产自救的信心日渐高涨。淮安县李许合作社在社员代表大会上贯彻了生产自救的方针，总结了战胜灾荒的经验。会后，党员、干部以身作则，领导社员订生产自救计划。目前，这个社已搞了运输、捕鱼、打野鸭等副业，二十天就收入七百多元。
    充分准备，发扬民主是开好代表大会的关键
    已开过社员代表大会的合作社之所以获得良好的效果，主要是抓住了两个主要环节：会前充分准备和会上充分发扬民主。会前的准备，如宣传社员代表大会的意义和作用、酝酿和选举代表、搜集社员意见整理提案等等，都是提高社干部和社员“民主办社”认识的过程。会上能否充分发扬民主，是决定会议成败的关键。不少代表在会前是有顾虑的，怕多提了意见会受社干部的报复；但是如果社干部能大胆地主动地揭露工作中的缺点和错误，就会使代表解除疑虑，畅所欲言。　（刘彦）
