    Critique of "On the Aesthetics of the Rentier"
    Cai Yi
    Huang Yaomian's article "On the Aesthetics of the Rentier," published in the 14th and 15th issues of "Wenyi Bao," is, as the subtitle indicates, a critique of Zhu Guangqian's aesthetic thought. He said, "As scientific workers, in order to seek the truth, we must never allow the remaining poison left by Mr. Zhu's false theory to circulate without being cleaned up." I admire Comrade Huang Yaomian's conscientious spirit, and just at the height of the "Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" call, I would like to write down some of my opinions after reading it and discuss them with Comrade Huang Yaomian and other aesthetic experts. (I)
    Although Huang Yaomian's article "only intends to select a few important points (referring to Zhu's theory – Cai) for criticism," it discusses quite a few issues. It should also be said that the issues discussed are indeed obvious errors in Zhu Guangqian's aesthetic thought, most of which have already been criticized in Zhu Guangqian's own articles, such as the theory of image intuition, the theory of emotional projection, the theory of psychological distance, and the formalist art theory. Huang Yaomian's article was written earlier, and it discusses some issues in more detail and gives some more vivid examples, which is one of the characteristics and advantages of this article.
    However, it is regrettable that the article only vaguely touches upon the basic arguments of Zhu Guangqian's aesthetic thought, which are also the basic questions in aesthetics, without focusing on analysis, clear explanation, or appropriate criticism.
      As the history of aesthetics proves, the basic question in aesthetics is first of all whether beauty lies in the mind or in things? Does aesthetic feeling determine beauty, or does beauty cause aesthetic feeling? Zhu Guangqian's answer to this question is to affirm the former and deny the latter. In his own words, "Beauty is born of aesthetic experience," "There is no innate, readily available beauty. All beauty must be created by the mind."
    Since he believes that "beauty is born of aesthetic experience" and all beauty is created by the mind, he must believe that the beautiful image of objective things is the product of subjective psychological activity, and the beautiful phenomenon of objective things is the externalization of subjective spirit. Zhu Guangqian advocates that "the image of things is a reflection of human emotions" and "a natural landscape is a state of mind." Therefore, all recognized objective things are externalizations of the subjective spirit. Needless to say, this is the basic argument of Zhu Guangqian's aesthetic thought, which is subjective idealism. This further manifests itself as the theory of image intuition, the theory of emotional projection, the theory of psychological distance, etc.; this further manifests itself as opposition to the affirmation of natural beauty and the advocacy of art imitating nature by realist masters such as Rodin and Ingres, and the belief that "the function of art lies in compensating for the defects of nature," which requires idealization and formalization, that is, anti-realism and advocacy of formalism.
    Huang Yaomian's article touches upon this basic argument of Zhu Guangqian's aesthetic thought in the following two paragraphs:
      "In his book 'The Psychology of Art and Literature,' Mr. Zhu starts with an analysis of aesthetic experience. In the article 'Modern Aesthetics and Literary Criticism,' he says, 'Therefore, the problem that modern aesthetics focuses on is: What is our psychological activity in aesthetic experience? As for the question of "How can things be considered beautiful" is secondary.' It is very obvious here that Mr. Zhu places his aesthetics on the study of subjective psychological activity.
      "Mr. Zhu said: 'Beauty is not only in things, nor only in the mind, it is in the relationship between the mind and things...' and also said: '...Beauty is neither in the mind nor in things but in expression.' Here, Mr. Zhu seems very 'objective,' neither agreeing with the mind nor agreeing with things, but reducing the problem to empty 'relationships' and 'expressions.' But in fact, Mr. Zhu is precisely using such clever words to eliminate the primacy of matter. If the primacy of matter is eliminated, then of course it can only be idealism."
    These words are the most important arguments for Huang Yaomian to criticize Zhu's aesthetic thought as idealism when he "further studies Mr. Zhu's entire aesthetic system." However, although this touches upon the basic problem of his aesthetic thought and points out that it is idealism, it cannot be said to be a serious criticism. For example, what does the sentence in the first paragraph, "Mr. Zhu places his aesthetics on the study of subjective psychological activity," mean? What is being criticized? It is not explained clearly.
    Zhu Guangqian's opening statement in "The Psychology of Art and Literature" is that the problem that modern aesthetics focuses on is: "What is our psychological activity in aesthetic experience?" not "What kind of things can be considered beautiful?" "The Psychology of Art and Literature" does indeed start from "the analysis of aesthetic experience." Huang Yaomian's criticism is nothing more than targeting these two points.
    However, the psychological activity of aesthetic feeling is an important part of aesthetics and deserves to be studied. Even if someone has only a general understanding of other issues in aesthetics, it is not necessarily wrong to specialize in the psychological activity of aesthetic feeling. Aesthetics as a science should be a unified whole, and its various parts should be organically interconnected. Therefore, it is not necessarily wrong to study aesthetics, even if starting from "the analysis of aesthetic experience" and moving towards other parts. Zhu Guangqian's mistake lies not in his emphasis on "the analysis of aesthetic experience," but in his incorrect analysis; not in starting "from the analysis of aesthetic experience," but in his belief that "beauty is born of aesthetic experience" and that beauty can only be found in aesthetic experience. Huang Yaomian does not point out the error of his basic argument, nor does he point out the reason for the error of his research path based on this basic argument, but only vaguely says that he "places his aesthetics on the study of subjective psychological activity," which is not explaining the problem, but obliterating it.
    Also, the second paragraph says that Zhu Guangqian "reduces the problem to empty 'relationships' and 'expressions'," therefore "eliminating the primacy of matter." Why is it "reducing the problem to empty 'relationships' and 'expressions'?" And why is it "eliminating the primacy of matter?" It is also not explained clearly.
    In the original text, Zhu Guangqian immediately said after "the relationship between the mind and things": "This relationship is not as Kant and most people imagine, in which things are stimuli and the mind is feeling; it is the mind using the image of things to express emotions. There is no innate, readily available beauty in the world. All beauty must be created by the mind." It should be seen that Zhu Guangqian's so-called "relationship between the mind and things" is "the mind using the image of things to express emotions," then this "relationship" is not "empty" at all. Similarly, "beauty is in expression" is also the "expression" of beauty in "the mind using the image of things to express emotions," then "expression" is obviously not "empty" either. These words of Zhu Guangqian are the most obvious expression of his basic argument. He specifically quoted and criticized them in his self-criticism article, saying: "Then, beauty is still in intuition, or in the mind, or subjective. I spent more than ten thousand words, going around and around, and finally did not escape the palm of Croce's subjective idealism." This kind of criticism shows that he wants to abandon the old basic argument; but Huang Yaomian specifically omits it, only quoting up to "the relationship between the mind and things," and instead says that this "relationship" and "expression" are empty, which is obviously deliberately not explaining the problem but obliterating it.
    As for how Zhu Guangqian's theory "eliminates the primacy of matter"? It is not because he "reduces the problem to empty 'relationships' and 'expressions'," but because he believes that beauty lies in "the mind using the image of things to express emotions," "all beauty must be created by the mind," believing that "the image of things is a reflection of human emotions" and "a natural landscape is a state of mind." As mentioned above, this is precisely subjective idealism, which is what "eliminates the primacy of matter." However, Huang Yaomian only says that Zhu Guangqian "reduces the problem to empty 'relationships' and 'expressions'," which is "eliminating the primacy of matter," which is also obviously deliberately not explaining the problem but obliterating it.
      Because he is not explaining the problem but obliterating it, his criticism can only be a criticism of "emptiness," and it can only be a completely "empty" criticism.
                        (II)
    Why does Huang Yaomian not explain the problem but instead obliterate the problem in criticizing the basic argument of Zhu Guangqian's aesthetic thought? Why does he treat Zhu Guangqian's non-empty theory as an empty term, making his criticism of this "emptiness" become a "void" of criticism? I don't think it's anything else, it's just because Huang Yaomian's criticism is standing on the basic argument of Zhu Guangqian.
    Although Huang Yaomian has not said "beauty is born of aesthetic experience" or that all beauty is created by the mind, what he discusses in his article is not "how things can be considered beautiful," but only how things can become "aesthetic objects" (the so-called "aesthetic objects" does not refer to the general objects of aesthetic research, but is the same as the general so-called "aesthetic objects" or "aesthetic objects"), then does Huang Yaomian, like Zhu Guangqian, believe that one cannot talk about beauty or that there is no such thing as beauty without aesthetic feeling and without human subjectivity? Does he, like Zhu Guangqian, want to "start from the analysis of aesthetic experience" and only find beauty in aesthetic experience? Let's see how Huang Yaomian argues how objective things become "aesthetic objects" to understand.
    How can objective things become "aesthetic objects"? Huang Yaomian first uses the example of the plum blossom cited by Zhu Guangqian to argue. According to him, the first "reason why plum blossoms can become aesthetic objects for some people" "lies in the fact that poets connect the image of plum blossoms with their own life practice and past experience, so that they can see the meaning of its image. Secondly, whether plum blossoms can be used as our aesthetic objects also depends on our mood at the time." "Finally, the reason why a person feels that this image or that image is beautiful is closely related to the person's ideological inclination." "Poets like Lin Hejing in ancient China, who appreciated themselves and considered themselves noble," associated plum blossoms "with their own lofty character, regarded plum blossoms as a symbol of their own character, and used them to express their feelings and express their own aesthetic ideals. It is precisely for this reason that plum blossoms have a particularly high aesthetic significance in his eyes." As for others, there is not such a high "aesthetic evaluation"; even if there is, it is based on his "life ideals" to evaluate it. (The "aesthetic significance" and "aesthetic evaluation" are the same as the general so-called "beautiful evaluation"; "aesthetic ideal" is approximately the same as "beautiful ideal" or "artistic ideal," etc. Huang Yaomian deliberately avoids using the word "beauty" here and replaces it with "aesthetics," which must have its own intentions.)
    It is not difficult to see that Huang Yaomian's so-called plum blossoms becoming "aesthetic objects" is not due to any reason of the plum blossoms themselves, but due to the reasons of human subjectivity. Although Huang Yaomian also mentioned the plum blossoms blooming in the severe cold and the vigorous branches, he believes that this only gives people "some pleasant feelings and moods" - only "giving us some pleasure in sight and smell"; it is neither the basis of "aesthetic evaluation" nor has any "aesthetic significance." Because he said very clearly here that the basis of "aesthetic evaluation" is "life ideal," and the "aesthetic significance" is due to the fact that people regard plum blossoms as a symbol of their own character and use them to express their feelings and express their own "aesthetic ideals." Since he believes that the becoming of plum blossoms as "aesthetic objects" does not have its own reasons, but only human subjective reasons, this is equivalent to saying that objective things themselves do not have so-called beauty, and only when people think they are beautiful are they beautiful. It is also equivalent to saying that beauty is subjectively determined and beauty is subjectively produced. From this point of view, Huang Yaomian and Zhu Guangqian are not different in the basic arguments of aesthetic thought.
    Of course, we also acknowledge that the reason why people think a certain object is beautiful is related to their life experience, their mood at the time, and their ideological inclinations. However, if the beauty of an object does not have its own reasons, but is only determined by human subjectivity; the so-called "aesthetic evaluation" does not have objective standards, but only subjective bases; then the evaluation of beauty can only be different due to human subjectivity, with no distinction between right and wrong, and no distinction between correct and incorrect. Beauty is an absolutely relative thing, which is relativism in aesthetics. In essence, it is the complete negation of beauty, which is nihilism in aesthetics.
    As Huang Yaomian said: "Since we want to talk about beauty, we cannot but talk about concrete images," so he also criticized Zhu Guangqian's theory about images. He said: "The 'image' that Mr. Zhu talks about is not an objectively existing thing, or a reflection of external things on us, but exists based on the 'seeing' of feeling. Without this 'seeing,' there is naturally no external world, and of course there is no image of the external world and our reflection of the image of the external world."
      Believing that "beauty lies in the mind" is to deny "the image belongs to things." Although Zhu Guangqian also said that "the image belongs to things," in fact, as mentioned above, he believes that "the image of things is a reflection of human emotions." Huang Yaomian here also seems to say that the image is "an objectively existing thing," but since he believes that the "aesthetic object" is only determined by subjective reasons, is the image he calls an image really an image that belongs to "an objectively existing thing"? Of course not.
      As quoted above, he said that the reason why the image of plum blossoms becomes an "aesthetic object" lies in the fact that people regard plum blossoms as a symbol of their own character, use them to express their feelings, and express their own "aesthetic ideals." In this way, the image of plum blossoms is originally a symbol of human character, an expression of emotion, and a expression of "aesthetic ideals." What is the difference between this argument and Zhu Guangqian's saying that "the image of things is a reflection of human emotions" and "a natural landscape is a state of mind"?
      I do not deny that people have the psychology and the fact of expressing their feelings through objects, but since the characteristics of the object itself are denied, then the image of the object used to express feelings, from the perspective of the subject expressing feelings, the image he sees is fundamentally a phantom of his own emotions, and from the perspective of the objective object, the image he sees is basically not the true image of the object. The so-called "beauty is in the eye of the beholder," this "beauty" is not the real beauty. Therefore, a natural landscape is by no means "a state of mind." Similarly, the image of plum blossoms is not a symbol of anyone's character. The image of things exists independently of the appraiser, and the beauty of the image of things also exists independently of the appraiser. If it is believed that the image of things depends on the appraiser, and at the same time it is said that there are "objectively existing things," such "things" are just Kant's "things in themselves," and such arguments are just old tunes of agnosticism, which are essentially still a "tune" of subjective idealism.
      Huang Yaomian also used the example of the image of the "Doric" stone pillars to criticize the theory of emotional projection. According to him, the reason why the image of the "Doric" stone pillars makes people feel towering and flying is not because of the emotions (or images) of the appraiser being transferred to the stone pillars as Lips and Zhu Guangqian said, and the appraiser's "self" enters the "non-self" to move, but because of "the personification of things"; the theory of Lips and Zhu Guangqian that the "self" and "non-self" are the same through empathy is "pure subjective idealism"; "In fact, expressing feelings through objects is a very common phenomenon in artistic and literary creation"; "The author in the creation is really me, not me, or in a complex and intertwined psychological state between me and non-me."
    Here, we certainly see Huang Yaomian's criticism of Zhu Guangqian, and we see him pointing out that Zhu Guangqian's and Lips' theories are subjective idealism. But what is the difference between Huang Yaomian's own theory and theirs?
    Regarding the "Doric" stone pillars, which make people feel towering and flying, Lips and Zhu Guangqian said that it is the "self" of the "non-self," while Huang Yaomian said that it is "the personification of things"; regarding this situation, Lips and Zhu Guangqian said that it is empathy, which is the same as the "self" and "non-self," while Huang Yaomian said that it is "expressing feelings through objects," which is a "complex and intertwined psychological state between me and non-me." If there is any difference between Huang Yaomian's theory and Zhu Guangqian's, I don't see anything other than Zhu Guangqian's is the so-called "pure idealism," while Huang Yaomian may be impure idealism.
    As for the creation of artistic images by literary and artistic writers, according to Huang Yaomian, the images that appear in the minds of writers are "not only a reflection of the corresponding forms of external things, but also contain the ideological inclinations, the meanings given, the tastes and moods cultivated, and the colors given by people from long-term life and theoretical studies; it contains the beautiful yearnings and ideal realms generated by people from their own life requirements and hopes." Moreover, "only when the writer has a certain guiding ideology and emotional keynote can he organize the images in his mind and structure them into a complete unity." In simple terms, the artistic image is not only a reflection of objective things, and it does not even have to be a correct reflection of objective things, but also contains the author's thoughts, emotions, "beautiful yearnings and ideal realms," especially to form a "complete unity" on the "certain guiding ideology and emotional keynote" of the writer. Therefore, the artistic image is fundamentally a manifestation of subjective thoughts, emotions, ideals, etc.; this is the same as what was said above: the image of objective things that become "aesthetic objects" is a symbol of human character, an expression of emotion, and an expression of "aesthetic ideals," the meanings of the two are completely the same. Such an artistic image is fundamentally not a correct reflection of the image of the external world, but is the same as Zhu Guangqian's saying that the image is "a reflection of the character and emotions of the viewer"; the creation of such an artistic image is fundamentally not a realistic and truthful description, but is no different from Zhu Guangqian's saying "expressing emotions in images" or "the imaging of emotions." Such an artistic theory is also anti-realistic, just like Zhu Guangqian.
    However, Huang Yaomian said: "Now, we can see the basic difference between us and Mr. Zhu. In Mr. Zhu's view, objective things only exist subjectively, and 'images' are completely subjective; but in our view, objective existence is the primary meaning, and the beauty of art mainly lies in its ability to truly express or imply the essence and laws of objective things through the description of life phenomena."
    Unfortunately, Huang Yaomian did not list the points of his so-called "basic differences" truthfully and sharply. If he were to list them truthfully and sharply, according to our above analysis, it would be like this: In Zhu Guangqian, although he said that "the image belongs to things," the "image of things is a reflection of human emotions," that is to say, "objective things only exist subjectively"; in Huang Yaomian, the text says that the image is "an objectively existing thing," but the theoretical essence believes that the image of things is a symbol of human character, an expression of emotion, and a expression of "aesthetic ideals," that is to say, the text admits that "objective existence is the primary meaning," but the theoretical essence also believes that objective things are an externalization of the subjective spirit. In Zhu Guangqian, the beauty of art (he believes that there is no natural beauty, only artistic beauty) lies in "the mind using the image of things to express emotions," in Huang Yaomian, the text says that the beauty of art mainly lies in its ability to truly reflect the essence and laws of objective things, but the theoretical essence believes that the image of art is fundamentally a manifestation of subjective thoughts, emotions, and ideals; that is to say, art, like other things, its image becomes a "aesthetic object," which is a symbol of human character, an expression of emotion, and an expression of "aesthetic ideals." Therefore, the basic argument of Huang Yaomian's aesthetic thought and the basic argument of Zhu Guangqian's basic theory, except for textual differences, have no essential differences in theoretical essence. That is to say, Huang Yaomian's aesthetic thought and Zhu Guangqian's original aesthetic thought are completely the same in their basic arguments, and both are subjective idealism.
    Of course, this does not mean that Huang Yaomian's aesthetic thought and Zhu Guangqian's aesthetic thought are completely the same in all arguments, definitely not. Huang Yaomian does oppose the theory of "intuition" in the theory of image intuition, believing that the image of things recognized by people is also related to people's thoughts; he opposes the theory of "distance" in the theory of psychological distance, believing that "aesthetic evaluation" should "bring the objective world into our lives" (？); he also opposes Zhu Guangqian's saying that the compensation of natural defects in art should be idealized and formalized, and advocates that art should express thoughts, emotions, ideals, or aesthetic ideals, that is, to be idealized, not formalized. However, these differences are only differences between subjective idealist aesthetic thoughts, which are very obvious.
                      (III)
    I believe that Huang Yaomian subjectively wants to use the principles of materialism to solve aesthetic problems, and I believe that he wants to use scientific and realistic theories as much as possible to criticize Zhu Guangqian's aesthetic thought. But we have to say that the logic of his theory is contrary to his subjective intention; as an aesthetic thought, his basic argument is contradictory to the scientific and realistic theories he wants to use. "Idealist doctrines use very abstract and ambiguous concepts, and the arguments are always contradictory." Huang Yaomian said that Zhu Guangqian "cannot escape this fateful disaster," and I think Huang Yaomian himself has not "escaped this fateful disaster." I don't want to specifically talk about Huang Yaomian's ambiguity of concepts and the contradiction of arguments here. From the explanations in the above two sections, it is not difficult to see this point.
    Since Huang Yaomian is using scientific and realistic theories, this certainly cannot be said to be wrong; and my saying that the basic argument of his aesthetic thought is subjective idealism is certainly not to obliterate the correctness of his use. That is to say, some of his arguments are in line with the principles of science and realism. However, his use of this theory not only did not overcome the errors of his basic argument, but on the contrary, it was sometimes affected by this erroneous basic argument, which made his use inevitably one-sided or even distorted.
    Art must describe the truth of reality and reflect the essence and laws of objective things in images. This is in line with the theory of reflection and the principles of realism. Since art must describe the truth of reality, and the description of the truth of reality is the essential characteristic of realist art, then the beauty of art must be fundamentally in the description of reality by art. Therefore, Huang Yaomian said: The beauty of art mainly lies in its ability to truly reflect the essence and laws of objective things. This statement raises one aspect of the essence of realist art, which is in line with the principles of the theory of reflection and is different from the theory of subjective idealism.
    However, the correctness of Huang Yaomian's sentence is contradictory to the basic argument of his aesthetic thought. According to his basic argument, the image of art becomes an "aesthetic object" because it serves as a symbol of the author's character, an expression of emotion, and a expression of "aesthetic ideals." That is to say, the image of art has fundamentally nothing to do with whether it reflects the essence and laws of reality. Due to the influence of this basic argument, he cannot explain the relationship between the image of art and the reflection of the essence and laws of reality by art. Therefore, he can only one-sidedly say: "The beauty of art mainly lies in its ability to truly reflect the essence and laws of objective things," which happens to obliterate that the image is the fundamental characteristic of art, obliterates that the image is the fundamental condition of the beauty of art, and also obliterates the basic laws of realism. This theory is not realistic, but anti-realistic.
    The creation of art is related to the author's thoughts and feelings, or to go further, whether the work of art is excellent or not is related to whether the author's thoughts are correct and whether the feelings are proper. There is no doubt about this. Huang Yaomian said: "In our view, the creation of art and literature is built on the writer's world view and world feeling." If this sentence mainly explains the subjectivity of artistic creation and emphasizes the important influence of the author's world view on artistic creation, this will be in line with historical facts and also in line with the principles of literary and artistic theory. However, the meaning of this sentence is obviously to say that the author's world view and world feeling (?) are the foundation on which art is built. Originally, the fundamental argument of his aesthetic thought is that the creation of artistic images is fundamentally the expression of the author's thoughts, emotions, and ideals. And saying this here is consistent with his basic argument. This not only fails to explain the different effects of the progress and reaction of the world view on artistic creation, but also neglects the objectivity of artistic creation and obliterates the realistic artistic laws of describing the truth of reality. It is neither in line with historical facts nor in line with the principles of literary and artistic theory.
    The above are just two simple examples to illustrate that the basic arguments of Huang Yaomian's aesthetic thought sometimes affect him from properly applying scientific and realistic theories, and his application is, in fact, sometimes one-sided or even distorted.
    In short, Huang Yaomian's article is ostensibly criticizing subjective idealist aesthetic thought, but in reality, it unexpectedly propagandizes subjective idealist aesthetic thought. If Zhu Guangqian's self-criticism article shows that he wants to leave his original foothold, then the basic argument of Huang Yaomian's article shows that he happens to be standing on Zhu Guangqian's foothold.
    As the saying goes, "Don't be afraid of not knowing the goods, as long as you compare the goods," I am just comparing Huang Yaomian's aesthetic thought with Zhu Guangqian's based on Huang Yaomian's article here. This comparison cannot help but feel that the critic has become another incarnation of the criticized thought, and aesthetics is still trapped in the maze of subjective idealism. Naturally, this is mainly due to the particular stubbornness of subjective idealism in aesthetic thought, and Huang Yaomian's article is just one manifestation of its stubbornness.
    My opinions may be wrong, but I want to raise them for everyone to correct. August 22, 1956

专栏：

    评“论食利者的美学”
    蔡仪
    “文艺报”十四、十五两期刊载黄药眠同志的
  “论食利者的美学”一文，如副标题所表示，是批判朱光潜同志的美学思想的。他说：“作为科学工作者的我们，为了探求真理，是绝不能让朱先生那种虚伪的理论所遗留下来的余毒流传而不去加以清理的”。我钦佩黄药眠同志这种认真负责的精神，也恰值“百家争鸣”的高呼声中，就想把自己读后的一点意见写下来，和黄药眠同志及其他美学专家商讨。（一）
    黄药眠这篇文章，虽说“只是想选择其中（按
  指朱的理论中——蔡）几个重要论点来加以批
  判”，可是谈的问题却是不少的。也应该说所谈
  的问题，确是朱光潜美学思想中的显然的错误，大部分就是朱光潜自己的文章也已批判过，如形相直觉说，感情移入说，心理距离说及形式主义的艺术理论等都是如此。而黄药眠的这篇文章写得较早，在某些问题上说得比较详细，更有一些具体例子说得比较生动，这是本文的特点和优点
  之一。
    然而遗憾的是，对于朱光潜美学思想的基本论点，也就是美学中的基本问题，本文却只是模糊地触到，并没有着重地分析，也没有清楚地说明，更没有恰好的批判。
      美学中的基本问题，如美学史的事实所证明，首先就是美在于心抑在于物？是美感决定美呢还是美引起美感？对于这个问题的答复，朱光潜是肯定前者而否定后者的。用他自己的话说，就是“美生于美感经验”，“没有天生自在，俯拾即是的美。凡是美都要经过心灵的创造”。
    既然认为“美生于美感经验”，凡美都是心灵的创造，就要认为客观事物的美的形象是主观心理活动的产物，客观事物的美的现象是主观精神的外化。而朱光潜就是主张：“物的形相就是人的情趣的返照”，“一片自然风景就是一种心境”，于是凡所认识的客观事物都是主观精神的外化，不用说，这是朱光潜美学思想的所以是主观唯心主义的基本论点。由此进一步表现为形相直觉说，感情移入说，心理距离说等；由此更进一步表现为反对罗丹、盎格尔等现实主义大师的肯定自然美、主张艺术模仿自然的说法，而认为“艺术的功用原在弥补自然的缺陷”，就要理想化、形式化，也就是反现实主义而主张形式主义。
    对于朱光潜美学思想的这一基本论点，在黄药眠的文章中是触到了的，那就是下面的两段话：
      “朱先生在‘文艺心理学’这本书里，一开头就是从美感经验的分析出发的。在‘近代美学与文艺批评’一文里，他说‘所以近代美学所侧重的问题是：在美感经验中我们的心理活动如何？至于“事物如何才能算是美”一个问题还在其次’。这里很明显，朱先生把他的美学是安放在主观的心理活动的研究上。
      “朱先生说：‘美不仅在物，亦不仅在心，它在心与物的关系上面，……’又说：‘……美不在心也不在物而在表现’。这里朱先生好像很
  ‘客观’既不赞成心，也不赞成物，而把问题归结到空洞的“关系”上和“表现”上。但实际上，朱先生正是用这样巧妙的词句把物质的第一性取消了。把物质的第一性取消了，那当然也就只能够是唯心论”。
    这些话正是黄药眠“进一步来研究一下朱先生的整个美学体系”时，批判他的美学思想是唯心论的最重要的论证。但是这里虽说触到了他的美学思想的基本问题，也指出了那是唯心论；然而并不能说这是认真的批判。譬如第一段所说的，
  “朱先生把他的美学是安放在主观的心理活动的研究上”，这句话究竟是什么意思？所批判的是什么？就没有说清楚。
    朱光潜在“文艺心理学”里开宗明义第一句话也就是说，近代美学所侧重的问题是：“在美感经验中，我们的心理活动是什么样？”不是
  “什么样的事物才能算是美？”“文艺心理学”也确是从“美感经验的分析”出发。黄药眠的批判不外是针对着这两点吧。
    但是美感的心理活动本是美学的重要组成部分，是美学必须研究也值得研究的。即算有人对于美学的其他问题仅有一般的理解，却要专门研究美感的心理活动，本也未必就是错的。美学的作为科学应该是统一的整体，它的各部分也应该是有机地互相关联的，因此研究美学，就是从“美感经验的分析”出发走向其他部分，也未必就不对。朱光潜的错误，原不在于他的着重“美感经验的分析”，而在于他的分析不正确；也不在于他是“从美感经验的分析出发”，而在于他认为“美生于美感经验”就只要在美感经验中找美。黄药眠并不指出他的基本论点的错误，也不指出他根据这一基本论点的研究途径的所以错误，只含混地说他“把他的美学是安放在主观的心理活动的研究上”，这就不是说明问题，而是抹煞问题。
    又如第二段说朱光潜“把问题归结到空洞的‘关系’上和‘表现’上”，因此是“把物质的第一性取消了”。为什么是“把问题归结到空洞的‘关系’上和‘表现’上”呢？又为什么是“把物质的第一性取消了”呢？也没有说清楚。
    朱光潜的原文，本来在“心与物的关系上面”之后紧接着还说：“这种关系并不如康德和
  一般人所想像的，在物为刺激，在心为感受；它
  是心借物的形象来表现情趣。世间并没有天生自在，俯拾即是的美。凡是美都要经过心灵的创造”。应该看到，朱光潜所谓“心与物的关系”
  就是“心借物的形象来表现情趣”，那么这种
  “关系”完全不是什么“空洞”的。同样，“美在表现”也就是美在“心借物的形象来表现情趣”的“表现”，那么“表现”也显然不是“空洞”的。朱光潜的这几句话，本是表现他的基本论点最显明的，他在自我批判的文章中就曾特意
  引来，并加以批判，说：“那么，美究竟还是在直觉，还是在心，还是主观的了。我花了万余言，绕来绕去，终于没有脱出克罗齐主观唯心论的掌心”。这样的批判，就是表现他想抛弃旧的基本论点；而黄药眠却把它特意略掉，只引到“心与物的关系”为止，反说这种“关系”和“表现”是空洞的，这又显然是特意不说明问题而抹煞
  问题。
    至于朱光潜的这种理论是怎样“把物质的第一性取消了”？也并不是因为他“把问题归结到空洞的‘关系’上和‘表现’上”，而是因为他认为美在于“心借物的形象来表现情趣”，“凡是美都要经过心灵的创造”，认为“物的形象就是人的情趣的返照”，“一片自然风景就是一种心境”。如上所说，这正是主观唯心主义，这才是“把物质的第一性取消了”。然而黄药眠只说朱光潜
  “把问题归结到空洞的‘关系’上和‘表现’上”就是“把物质的第一性取消了”，这也显然是特意不说明问题而抹煞问题。
      由于他不是说明问题而是抹煞问题，于是他的批判就只能是对“空洞”的批判，而且只能是十足“空洞”的批判。
                        （二）
    为什么黄药眠在批判朱光潜美学思想的基本论点上，这样不说明问题反而抹煞问题呢？为什么他把朱光潜并非空洞的理论当作空洞的名词，使自己对这“空洞”的批判成为批判的“空洞”呢？我看并不是别的，只是由于黄药眠的批判正是站在朱光潜的基本论点上。
    黄药眠虽然没有说过“美生于美感经验”、凡美都是心灵的创造的话，但是在他的文章中所论的全然不是“事物如何才能算是美”，而只是事物怎样才能成为“美学对象”（按所谓“美学对象”并非指美学研究的一般对象，而是和一般所谓“美感对象”或“审美对象”是一样的），那么黄药眠是不是和朱光潜一样，认为离开美感、离开人的主观不能谈美、也无所谓美呢？是不是和朱光潜一样要“从美感经验的分析出发”也只在美感经验中找美呢？试看黄药眠的论证客观事物怎样成为“美学对象”就能明白。
    客观事物怎样才能成为“美学对象”呢？黄药眠首先是就朱光潜所举的梅花为例来论证的。据他说来，“梅花之所以能成为某一些人的美学对象”，第一个“原因是在于，诗人们把梅花这个形象和自己的生活实践，过去的经验联系起来，这样才看出它的形象的意义。其次，梅花之是否能作为我们的美学的对象，同时也要看我们当时的心境”。“最后，一个人之所以会觉得这一个形象或那一个形象美，是和这个人的思想倾向有密切关系的”。“像中国古代林和靖这样的诗人，他是孤芳自赏自命高洁的人物”，把梅花“和自己的孤高的性格联系起来，把梅花当作自己的性格的象征，用以借物抒情，来表现出他自己的美学理想。也正由于这个缘故，梅花在他看来，就具有着特别高的美学的意义”。至于对别人就没有那么高的“美学评价”了；即使有的话，也是根据他的“生活理想”去评价了。（按“美学的意义”和“美学评价”，相同于一般所谓“美的评价”；
  “美学理想”大约相同于“美的理想”或“艺术理想”之类。黄药眠在这里着意避免用“美”之一词而以“美学”代之，当亦自有其用意。）
    不难看出，黄药眠所谓梅花的成为“美学对象”，并非由于梅花本身的什么原因，而是由于人的主观的原因。虽然黄药眠也曾说到梅花的严寒开放、枝干遒劲，但认为这只是给人“一些愉快的感觉情调”——只是“在视觉和嗅觉上给予我们一些快感”；既不是“美学评价”的根据，也没有什么“美学的意义”。因为这里他说得很明白，“美学评价”的根据是“生活理想”，“美学的意义”则是由于人把梅花作为自己性格的象征，用以借物抒情来表现自己的“美学理想”的缘故。既然认为梅花的成为“美学对象”没有它本身的原因，只是人的主观的原因，这就等于说客观事物本身并无所谓美，只是被人认为美才是美的。也等于说美是主观决定的，美是主观产生的。由此看来，在美学思想的基本论点上，黄药眠和朱光潜是没有什么不同的。
    自然我们也承认人之所以认为某一对象的美，是和他的生活经验、当时的心境及他的思想倾向等有关系。但是对象的美如果没有它本身的原因，只是决定于人的主观；所谓“美学评价”也没有客观的标准，只有主观的根据；那么美的评价也就只能是因人的主观而异，既无是非之分，也无正误之别，美就是绝对地相对的东西，这就是美学上的相对主义。实质上也就是美的完全否定，是美学上的虚无主义。
    正如黄药眠所说：“既然要谈美，就不能不谈具体的形象”，所以他也曾批判朱光潜的关于
  形象的理论。他说：“朱先生所说的‘形象’并不
  是客观地存在着的物，或是我们对于外在的物的
  反映，而是依感觉‘见’而存在着的。没有这个
  ‘见’，自然也就没有什么外在世界，当然也就
  没有外在世界的形象和我们对于外在世界的形象
  底反映了”。
      认为“美在于心”就要否认“形象属于物”。
  朱光潜虽然也说“形象属于物”，然而实际上是如上所说认为“物的形象就是人的情趣的返照”。黄药眠在这里也似乎说形象是“客观地存在着的物”，但他既然认为“美学对象”只是主观的原
  因决定的，那么他所谓形象是否果然属于“客观地存在着的物”呢？当然不会是的。
      如上所引他的话说，梅花这个形象之所以成为“美学对象”，在于人把梅花当作自己的性格的象征，用以借物抒情，来表现自己的“美学理想”。这样说来，梅花的形象原来是人的性格的象征、感情的抒发和“美学理想”的表现，这种论调和朱光潜所谓“物的形象就是人的情趣的返照”，“一片自然风景就是一种心境”的说法，又有什么区别吗？
      我并不否认人有借物抒情的心理及事实，但是既然否认物本身的特点，那么被人用以抒情的物的形象，从抒情的主体来说，他所见的形象根本是自己的情趣的幻影，从客观的物来说，他所见的形象基本上不是真正的物的形象。所谓“情人眼里出西施”，这“西施”就并不是真正的西施。所以一片自然风景决不是“一种心境”，同样，梅花的形象也不是什么人的性格的象征。物的形象是不依赖于鉴赏者的人而存在的，物的形象的美也是不依赖于鉴赏的人而存在的。如果认为物的形象依存于鉴赏的人，同时又说有“客观地存在着的物”，这样的“物”不过是康德的“物自体”，这样的论调也不过是不可知论的老调，实质上还是主观唯心主义的“曲调”。
      黄药眠又曾就“道芮式”石柱形象的例子来批判感情移入说。据他说来，“道芮式”石柱形象的叫人觉得耸立飞腾，不是立普司、朱光潜所谓由于鉴赏者的感情（或意象）移于石柱，鉴赏者的“自我”进到“非自我”里活动，而是由于“人对于事物的人格化”；立普司、朱光潜所谓由移情作用而得到的“自我”与“非自我”的同一之说，是“纯粹的主观唯心论”；“其实，借物抒情，这是艺术文学创作上很平常的现象”；“在创作中的作者，实在是我，又不是我，或是我与非我之间的复杂交错的心理状态中”。
    在这里我们固然看到了黄药眠对于朱光潜的批判，看到了他指出朱光潜、立普司的理论是主观唯心主义。但是黄药眠自己的理论和他们的区别又在什么地方呢？
    关于“道芮式”石柱的叫人觉得耸立飞腾，立普司、朱光潜说是“非自我”的“自我”化，而黄药眠说是“事物的人格化”；关于这种情况，立普司、朱光潜说是移情作用，是“自我”与“非自我”的同一，而黄药眠说是“借物抒情”，是“我与非我之间的复杂交错的心理状态”。如果说黄药眠的这种论点和朱光潜的有什么区别的话，我看不外是朱光潜是所谓“纯粹的唯心论”，而黄药眠也许是不纯粹的唯心论罢了。
    至于文艺作家的创造艺术形象，据黄药眠说，涌现在作家脑子里的形象，“也不仅仅是对外在事物之相应的形态的反映，而且还包涵着人们从长期生活中、理论学习中所培养出来的思想倾向，所赋予的意义，所培养出来的趣味和情调，所赋予的色彩；包涵着人们从自己的生活要求和希望中所产生出来的美丽的憧憬和理想的境界”。而且“只有当作家有一定的主导思想和情感的基调，他才能够把自己脑子里的形象组织起来，使它们结构成一个完整的统一体”。简单的说，艺术的形象不仅仅是客观事物的反映，更不必是客观事物的正确反映，还包涵着作者的思想、感情、“美丽的憧憬和理想的境界”，尤其是要在作家“一定的主导思想和感情的基调”上构成一个“完整的统一体”。于是艺术形象根本上是主观的思想、感情、理想等的表现；这就和上面所说：成为“美学对象”的客观事物的形象，是人的性格的象征、感情的抒发及“美学理想”的表现，两者的意思完全是一样的。这样的艺术形象根本上不是对于外在世界的形象的正确反映，而是和朱光潜所说形象是“观赏者的性格和情趣的返照”一样的；这样的艺术形象的创造根本上不是现实真实的描写，而是和朱光潜所说“表现情趣于意象”或“情趣的意象化”没有什么不同。这样的艺术理论也就和朱光潜同样是反现实主义的。
    然而黄药眠却说：“现在，可以看出我们和朱先生的基本分歧了。在朱先生看来，客观事物只是主观地存在着，‘形象’完全是主观的东西；但在我们看来，客观存在是第一义的，艺术的美，主要的是在于它能够通过生活现象的描写，真实地表现出或者暗示出客观事物的本质和规律”。
    可惜黄药眠并不是将他所谓“基本分歧”之点，如实地、针锋相对地并举出来。假使要如实地、针锋相对地并举出来，据我们上面的分析却是这样：在朱光潜，虽说“形象属于物”，而“物的形象就是人的情趣的返照”，这就是说，“客观事物只是主观地存在着”的；在黄药眠，文字上说形象是“客观地存在着的物”，理论实质上认为物的形象是人的性格的象征、感情的抒发及
  “美学理想”的表现，也就是说，文字上承认“客观存在是第一义的”，理论实质上也是认为客观事物是主观精神的外化。在朱光潜，艺术的美
  （他认为没有自然美，只有艺术美）在于“心借物的形象来表现情趣”，在黄药眠，文字上说：艺术的美主要的是在于它能够真实地反映出客观事物的本质和规律，理论实质上认为艺术的形象根本是主观的思想、感情、理想的表现；也就是说，艺术也如其他事物一样，它的形象的成为
  “美学对象”，是人的性格的象征、感情的抒发及“美学理想”的表现。因此，黄药眠美学思想的基本论点和朱光潜的基本论点，除了文字上的分歧之外，理论实质上根本没有什么分歧。也就是说，黄药眠的美学思想和朱光潜原来的美学思想，在基本论点上是完全相同的，同样是主观唯心主义。
    当然这并不是说，黄药眠的美学思想和朱光潜的美学思想，在一切论点上都完全相同，决不是的。黄药眠确是反对形象直觉说的关于“直觉”的理论，认为人所认识的物的形象也和人的思想有关系；反对心理距离说的“距离”的理论，认为“美学评价”要“把客观世界拉到我们的生活里面来”（？）；还反对朱光潜的艺术弥补自然缺陷就要理想化、形式化之说，而主张艺术要表现思想、感情、理想或美学理想，也就是要理想化，而不要形式化。然而这些区别，只是主观唯心主义美学思想之间的区别，则是很明显的。
                      （三）
    我相信黄药眠主观上是要用唯物主义的原则来解决美学问题的，相信他是要尽可能运用科学的、现实主义的理论来批判朱光潜的美学思想的。但是我们不得不说，他的理论的逻辑和他的主观的意图是相反的；作为美学思想来说，他的基本论点和他所要运用的科学的、现实主义的理论之间是矛盾的。“唯心主义的学说，用的概念是非常之抽象和含混，论点总是先后矛盾的。”黄药眠说，朱光潜“不能逃掉这一个宿命的灾难”，我看黄药眠自己也没有“逃掉这一个宿命的灾难”。我不想在这里特地来谈黄药眠的概念的含混和论点的矛盾，由上面两节的说明，大致已不难看出这点吧。
    黄药眠既然在运用科学的、现实主义的理论，这当然不能说不对；而我说他的美学思想的基本论点是主观唯心主义，也当然不是要抹煞他的运用的对处。也就是说，他有些论证是合乎科学的、现实主义的原则的。然而他的运用这种理论不仅没有克服他的基本论点的错误，相反的，倒是有时受这错误的基本论点的影响，却使他的运用不免是片面的，甚至是歪曲的。
    艺术要描写现实的真实，要以形象反映客观事物的本质规律，这是合乎反映论、合乎现实主义的原则的。既然艺术要描写现实的真实，而描写现实的真实是现实主义艺术的本质的特点，那么艺术的美必然是基本上在于艺术的描写现实真实。所以黄药眠所说：艺术的美主要的是在于它能够真实地反映出客观事物的本质和规律。这个说法，究竟提出了现实主义艺术的本质的一个方面，是合乎反映论的原则的，是和主观唯心主义的理论不同的。
    然而黄药眠的这一句话的对处，就和他的美学思想的基本论点是矛盾的，按他的基本论点，艺术形象的成为“美学对象”，在于它作为作者的性格的象征、感情的抒发及“美学理想”的表现。也就是说，艺术的形象，根本无关于它是否反映现实的本质规律。由于这一基本论点的影响，就使得他不能说明艺术的形象和艺术的反映现实的本质规律的关系，于是只能片面地说：“艺术的美主要的是在于它能够真实地反映出客观事物的本质和规律”，这就恰好抹煞了形象性是艺术的根本特点，抹煞了形象是艺术的美的根本条件，也抹煞了现实主义的基本法则，这种理论就不是现实主义的，而是反现实主义的。
    艺术的创造关系于作者的思想感情，或者进一步说，艺术作品的优美与否关系于作者的思想正确与否、感情正当与否，这是毫无问题的。黄药眠说：“在我们看来，艺术文学的创造，是建筑在作家的世界观和世界感上”。如果这句话主要是说明艺术创造的主观性，强调作者的世界观对于艺术创造的重要影响，这就会是合乎历史事实，也合乎文艺理论的原则的。然而这句话的意思显然是说，作者的世界观和世界感（？）是艺术建筑于其上的基础。原来他的美学思想的根本论点，认为艺术形象的创造根本上是作者的思想、感情、理想的表现。而这里的这样说，就和他的基本论点正是一致的。这就不仅没有说明世界观的进步与反动对艺术创造所起的作用好坏不同，尤其是忽视了艺术创造的客观性，抹煞了描写现实真实的现实主义的艺术法则，那是既不合乎历史事实，也不合乎文艺理论的原则的。
    以上只是举两个简单的例子，说明黄药眠的美学思想的基本论点，有时影响他不能恰当地运用科学的、现实主义的理论，他的运用事实上就有的是片面的，甚至是歪曲的。
    要之，黄药眠这篇文章，表面上是在批判主观唯心主义的美学思想，实际上却出乎他的意料之外地根本上是在宣传主观唯心主义的美学思想。如果说朱光潜的自我批判文章，表示他想离开原来的立脚点，那么黄药眠的这篇文章的基本论点，却表示他恰好站在朱光潜的立脚点上。
    俗话说得好，“不怕不识货，只要货比货”，我在这里不过是就黄药眠这篇文章，把他的美学思想和朱光潜的比了一下。这一比，不禁感觉到：批判者成了被批判的思想的另一个化身，而美学依然陷在主观唯心主义的迷魂阵里。自然，这主要是由于主观唯心主义在美学思想上的特别顽强，黄药眠的这篇文章不过是它的顽强的一种表现罢了。
    我的意见也许是错误的，但是我想提出来就正于大家。　1956年8月22日
