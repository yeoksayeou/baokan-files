Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, December 22nd: The Baotou branch of the Anshan Metallurgical Construction Company, which is actively carrying out the construction preparation work for the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex, comprehensively overfulfilled this year's construction plan by mid-December.

　　A year ago, the construction site of this company was still a wilderness. Now, a building complex including a joint timber processing plant, a mechanized supply station, a steel bar processing plant, a general repair plant, and more than ten other enterprises has been erected on the construction site. These enterprises will undertake the production of all prefabricated components and building materials during the construction of the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex.

　　The 200,000 square meters of housing constructed by this company this year are now occupied by builders from all over the country. Surrounding the residences are newly built employee clubs, kindergartens, department stores, and schools.

    包钢建成许多附属企业
    据新华社包头22日电　正在积极进行包头钢铁联合企业施工准备工作的鞍山冶金建筑公司包头分公司，到12月中旬全面超额完成了今年的施工计划。
  这个公司施工的工地上，一年以前还是一片荒野。现在，一个包括木材联合加工厂、机械化供应站、钢筋加工厂、总修理厂等十多个企业的建筑群，已经在工地上矗立起来。这些企业将担负包头钢铁联合企业建设过程中全部预制构件和建筑器材的生产。
    这个公司今年施工的二十万平方公尺的住宅，现在住进了来自祖国各地的建设者。住宅周围是今年新建的职工俱乐部、幼儿园、百货商店和学校。
