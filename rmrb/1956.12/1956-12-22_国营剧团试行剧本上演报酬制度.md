State-Owned Theaters to Pilot Play Performance Royalty System

    (Our report) The Ministry of Culture issued a "Notice Regarding the Trial Implementation of Performance Royalties for Playwrights in State-Owned Theaters" on December 14th. The notice stated:

    Regarding the issue of paying playwrights performance royalties, the government has never made explicit regulations in the past due to various historical and social reasons. Currently, the country's economic situation has changed. In order to guarantee the livelihood and rights of playwrights, better implement the principle of distribution according to work, encourage play creation, and enable theatrical work to better serve our country's socialist construction, it is necessary to gradually implement a play performance royalty system. To this end, the notice stipulates:

    Professional theater groups that perform original or adapted plays should pay performance royalties to the playwrights for all performances with economic income, except for purely voluntary performances for the purpose of consolation and performances of a review and observational nature within the theater group.

    Professional theater groups (including opera, drama, traditional opera, puppet shows, shadow plays, etc.) must respect the copyright of playwrights. For all plays performed, whether original, adapted, or translated, the original playwright, adapter, or translator should be notified before the performance (if the mailing address is unknown, it can be forwarded by the Chinese Dramatists Association).

    Based on the current different number of various professional theater groups and the imbalance in the opportunity to perform various forms of plays, the performance royalties for plays will be calculated temporarily according to the following standards:

    A. For original opera scripts performed, 6% of the total performance income, after deducting national taxes and theater rent (or theater revenue sharing), from the theater's total income should be given to the playwright and composer as performance royalties. The proportion of royalties between the playwright and composer can be determined through consultation based on the magnitude of their role in the play.

    B. For original spoken drama scripts performed, 3% of the total income of the theater, after deducting national taxes and theater rent (or revenue sharing), should be given to the playwright as performance royalties.

    C. For original traditional opera scripts performed, 3% of the total income of the theater, after deducting national taxes and theater rent (or revenue sharing), should be given to the playwright as performance royalties.

    D. For original puppet shows, shadow plays, and children's play scripts performed, the performance royalties should be paid to the playwright according to the standards of opera, spoken drama, or traditional opera, as stipulated in items A, B, and C of this article respectively.

    In addition, the notice also made provisions for performance royalties for performing plays by translated foreign writers, plays adapted from other literary and artistic forms, etc.

    These regulations are tentatively scheduled to be piloted in state-owned professional theater groups (excluding theater groups that were converted to state-owned during the socialist transformation in the high tide of late 1955 and early 1956) starting from January 1, 1957.

    国营剧团试行剧本上演报酬制度
    本报讯　文化部12月14日发出“关于国营剧团试行付给剧作者剧本上演报酬的通知”。通知中说：
    关于付给剧作家剧本上演报酬的问题，过去由于历史的、社会的各种原因，政府从未作过明文规定；目前国家经济情况已经有了变化，为了保障剧作家的生活和权益，更好地实行按劳取酬的原则，鼓励剧本创作，使戏剧工作更好地为我国的社会主义建设服务，必须逐步推行剧本上演报酬制度。为此，通知中规定：
    专业剧团上演创作或改编的剧本，除纯粹义务性的慰问演出及剧团内部审查、观摩性质的演出外，其他一切有经济收入的演出，都应付给剧作者剧本上演报酬。
    专业剧团（包括歌剧、话剧、戏曲、木偶、皮影等）必须尊重剧作者的著作权，凡上演的剧本不论为创作的、改编的或翻译的，都应于演出前通知原剧作者、改编者或翻译者（通讯处不详者可由中国戏剧家协会转交）。
    根据目前各种专业剧团数量的不同，各种形式的剧本上演机会的不平衡，剧本的上演报酬暂按下列标准计算：
    甲、凡上演创作的歌剧剧本，应从全部演出收入中，除去国家税收及剧场租金（或剧场分帐）后，在剧团所得的全部收入中提取6％给予剧作者和作曲者，作为剧本上演报酬。剧作者和作曲者的分酬比例可按在剧本中所起作用的大小，自行协商规定。
    乙、上演创作的话剧剧本，应于除去国家税收及剧场租金（或分帐）后，在剧团所得全部收入中提取3％给予剧作者，作为剧本上演报酬。
    丙、上演创作的戏曲剧本，应于除去国家税收及剧场租金（或分帐）后，在剧团所得全部收入中提取3％给予剧作者，作为剧本上演报酬。
    丁、上演创作的木偶戏、皮影戏及儿童剧剧本，则视其为歌剧、话剧或戏曲，分别按本条甲、乙、丙各项标准，付给剧作者上演报酬。
    此外，通知中对于上演翻译的外国作家的剧本、根据其他文艺形式改编的剧本等，其上演报酬也都作了规定。
    这些规定暂定自1957年1月1日起在国营的专业剧团（1955年底1956年初社会主义改造高潮时转为国营的剧团不在内）中试行。
