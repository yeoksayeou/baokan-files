Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 20th: The Soviet Union has created an automatic printing device using electronic principles, which can print books, newspapers, and magazines without typesetting, master copies, or rotary presses. This creation opens a new era for the printing industry.

This new method uses an ordinary facsimile transmitter, used for long-distance transmission of printed images, to convert the image to be printed into a series of electrical pulses. These electrical pulses are then used to "magnetize" the magnetic film on a ferromagnetic tape, recording the image like a tape recorder. This magnetic film then becomes the printing mold, which is installed on a printing press. The experimental printing press currently consists of two cylinders with a ferromagnetic tape tightly wound around them. During printing, the ferromagnetic tape rotates, touching the paper to be printed and creating an invisible magnetic field image on the paper. At this point, ferromagnetic color powder, which can be attracted by even a weak magnetic force, is sprinkled on the paper. The image to be printed then appears. This changes the entire printing process.

The Soviet Printing Machine Manufacturing Science Research Institute has established a special laboratory to study this printing equipment. The work of the laboratory has achieved preliminary results. These results not only open up broad prospects for the development of the printing industry based on new principles, but also offer the hope of using photosensitive semiconductor layers for high-speed electronic photography in the future. Using this method of photography, a photograph can be obtained in a few seconds without development, fixing, or other chemical processes, and without the need for negatives.

    苏联创制运用电子学原理的印刷设备
    新华社莫斯科20日电　苏联创制了一种运用电子学原理的自动印刷设备，无需排铅字和铅版大样，也无需轮转机就能印刷书报杂志。这个创造为印刷业开辟了一个新的纪元。
    这种新办法是用普通远距离传送印刷图片用的传真发送机，把要印刷的形象变成一系列的电脉冲，然后用电脉冲“磁化”铁磁带的磁薄膜，像录音一样地使磁薄膜把形象录下来，成为印刷模子，安在印刷机上印书。目前试验的印刷机由两个圆柱体构成，上面紧勒着铁磁带，印刷时铁磁带转动，触动要印刷的纸，使纸上制出看不见的形象磁场，这时往纸上撒上只要微弱的磁力就能吸住的铁磁颜色粉。要印的形象就显现出来了。这样就把印刷术的全部过程都改变了。
    苏联印刷机器制造科学研究所为了研究这种印刷设备，特地设立了一个实验室。实验室的工作已经取得了初步结果。这些结果不仅为发展以新原理为基础的印刷业开辟了广阔前景，而且使将来有希望运用光敏半导体层进行高速电子摄影。利用这种方法摄影，在几秒钟里，不经过显影、定影等化学过程，不需要底片马上就能得出照片来。
