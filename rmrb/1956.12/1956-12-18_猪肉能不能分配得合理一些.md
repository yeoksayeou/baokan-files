    Could Pork Distribution Be More Reasonable?

    Recently, I stayed in Yidu County and Linqu County, Shandong Province for a few days and found some unreasonable aspects in the pork supply in these two places: Compared with the staff of government organizations and groups, ordinary residents eat too little meat and have too much difficulty buying it. Taking Chengguan Town in Yidu as an example, according to the statistics for the first twenty-seven days of November, the average amount of pork eaten by each government employee was about forty times the average amount eaten by ordinary residents.

    In Chengguan Town, Yidu County, there are approximately 8,200 staff members in government agencies, enterprises (including joint state-private enterprises), and schools. The Yidu County Food Company guarantees to supply them with one tael of pork per person per day, which is equivalent to about two jin per person per month. After the canteens of various organizations receive the meat from the local pork retail department on schedule, employees who do not eat in the canteen can also take the meat back to their homes.

    From November 1st to 27th, the Yidu County Chengguan Town Pork Cooperative Store supplied 410 live pigs to government organizations and groups. Calculating 50 jin of meat per pig (pork here is sold after the skin is removed), this amounts to 20,500 jin. The 8,200 staff members averaged 2.5 jin of meat each.

    In addition to these 8,200 staff members, there are also 35,000 Han residents in Chengguan Town, Yidu County. The pork they need to eat can only be purchased by queuing when the pork store occasionally supplies some pork. Also, from November 1st to 27th, the Yidu Pork Cooperative Store only supplied 56 live pigs to ordinary residents. Similarly, calculating 50 jin of meat per pig, 56 pigs amount to 2,800 jin. With 35,000 residents buying this meat, the average person only gets a little over one tael. Moreover, among these 30,000+ residents, those who have time to queue can buy some; those who do not have time to queue can only go without meat for a long time.

    Even newcomers to Yidu can immediately sense the situation where government officials eat more meat and ordinary residents eat less or even no meat for extended periods. I have eaten several meals in the canteens of several government agencies and enterprises and was able to eat some pork at every meal. When I asked ordinary residents about their meat consumption, they all shook their heads because it was very difficult to buy pork.

    This situation is even more obvious in the rural markets of Linqu County. I went to Longgang Market in Yingzi District, Linqu County, to understand the local pork supply situation. Although Longgang Market has two market days every five days, pork is not sold at every market day. When there is meat, only one or two or two or three pigs can be supplied per market day. Even when only one or two or two or three pigs are supplied, the supply and marketing cooperatives, grain depots, agricultural product purchasing stations, and other units stationed in this market always give priority to buying dozens of jin. The remaining meat is already limited, and it must first be sold to some people who have "chits." Some of these chits are issued by the canteens of nearby elementary schools, and some are issued by the township people's committees to farmers who need to hold weddings or funerals. In addition, demobilized soldiers are given preferential treatment, and each person can buy two jin at a time. One or two or two or three pigs are divided in this way, so it is conceivable how much ordinary farmers can buy.

    There are many people who want to eat pork, and there is little pork available. Most people would not object if everyone ate a little less. However, if the distribution is too unfair, many people will be dissatisfied. Can this situation be changed? Chang Feng

### 猪肉能不能分配得合理一些

    猪肉能不能分配得合理一些
    最近我在山东省益都县和临朐县住了几天，发现这两个地方在猪肉供应上有些不大合理的地方：同机关团体的职工比起来，一般居民吃肉太少，买肉也太困难。以益都城关镇为例，根据11月份的前二十七天统计，机关职工每人所吃猪肉的平均数量，约等于一般居民每人平均数量的四十倍。
    益都县城关镇各机关、企业（包括公私合营企业）和学校的职工约有八千二百多人，益都县食品公司保证供给他们每人每天一两猪肉，折合一个月一人约二斤。各机关食堂按期从当地猪肉零售部门领回后，职工不在食堂吃饭的，还可以把肉带回自己的家里去。
    从11月1日到27日，益都县城关镇猪肉合作商店供应了四百一十头生猪肉给机关团体，以一头猪出肉五十斤计算（这里的猪肉要去皮后才卖），合二万零五百斤，八千二百多名职工平均每人吃肉二斤半。
    在这八千二百多名职工以外，益都县城关镇还有汉族居民三万五千人；他们所需要吃的猪肉，只能在猪肉商店偶尔供应一些猪肉的时候排队购买。也是从11月1日到27日，益都猪肉合作商店只供应了五十六头生猪肉给一般居民，同样以每头猪出肉五十斤计算，五十六头合肉二千八百斤。三万五千居民购买这些肉，平均每人只有一两多。而且，这三万多居民中，有时间去排队的，还可以买到一些；没有时间去排队的，就只好长期不知肉味了。
    机关干部吃肉比较多，一般居民吃肉少甚至长期吃不到肉的情况，即使新到益都的人，也会立刻感觉到。我曾经在几个机关、企业的食堂里吃过几次饭，每顿都能吃到一些猪肉；向一般居民问起他们吃肉的情况，他们都为很难买到猪肉而摇头。
    这种情况，在临朐县的农村集市上更明显。我曾到临朐县营子区龙岗集了解当地猪肉供应情况。龙岗集虽然五天两集，但是并不是每集都有猪肉卖；有肉的时候，一集也只能供应一两头或两三头猪。就在供应这一两头到两三头猪肉的时候，驻在这个集上的供销社、粮库、农产品采购站等单位总要优先买去好几十斤。剩下的肉已经有限了，还要先卖给一些“打了条子”的人。这些条子，有的是附近几个小学校食堂出具的，也有的是乡人民委员会给要办婚丧等事的农民开的。此外，还优待复员军人，每人一次还可以买二斤。一两头或两三头猪肉被这样一分，一般农民究竟能够买到多少，可想而知。
    要吃猪肉的人多，猪肉少，大家都少吃一些，多数人不会有意见。分配过于不公平，很多人就会不满意。这种情况难道不能有所改变吗？　昌凤
