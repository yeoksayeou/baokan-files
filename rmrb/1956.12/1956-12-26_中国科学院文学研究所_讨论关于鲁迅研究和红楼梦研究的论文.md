　　Chinese Academy of Sciences Literary Research Institute
　　Discusses Papers on Lu Xun and Dream of the Red Chamber Studies
　　(Our Newspaper) The Literary Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences discussed some of the papers of its researchers from the 17th to the 22nd. The first focus of the discussion was on Lu Xun studies, with a total of three papers: Chen Yong's "Lu Xun's Struggle for Realism in Literature and Art" ("People's Literature" October issue), Cai Yi's "Lu Xun on the Typical" ("Literary Research Collection" Fourth Issue), and He Qifang's "On Ah Q" (People's Daily, October 16th). The second focus of the discussion was on Dream of the Red Chamber studies, with a total of two papers: He Qifang's "On Dream of the Red Chamber" (unpublished), and Cao Daoheng's "On the Thoughts of Huang Zongxi, Gu Yanwu, Wang Fuzhi, etc., and Their Relationship with Dream of the Red Chamber" (unpublished). In addition to the researchers of the Literary Research Institute, some professors from the Chinese Department of Peking University and literary and artistic theory critics Feng Youlan, Feng Xuefeng, Feng Zhi, Yang Hui, Qian Xuexi, Shu Wu, and Chen Qiufan also participated in the discussion.

　　Many comrades believe that these articles are the result of in-depth research, and articles like those by Chen Yong and Cai Yi are new contributions to Lu Xun studies. Some of them, such as He Qifang's "On Ah Q," "On Dream of the Red Chamber," and Cao Daoheng's article, put forward new viewpoints that differ from popular views regarding the research of certain works.

　　Many comrades believe that the article "On Ah Q" is of great significance in clarifying the dogmatism and vulgar sociological viewpoints in research work. The difference of opinion lies in the analysis of Ah Q's typical character. Many comrades who participated in the discussion believed that He Qifang's view of the "most prominent feature" of Ah Q's typical character – the "spiritual victory method," which "plays a role" – as similar to "one of the common weaknesses of mankind" and existing in members of different eras and different classes, negates the specific social and historical conditions that produced Ah Q's typical character. In particular, abstracting Ah Q's spiritual victory method into something similar to "one of the common weaknesses of mankind" actually cancels out the era and social content of Ah Q's spirit, turning the rich characteristics of Ah Q's character into an abstract concept of Ah Q's spirit.

　　During the discussion, He Qifang also expressed his opinions. He said that some of the wording in the article was indeed not clear enough or precise enough. However, he believes that some comrades misunderstand his article, and some "divergent" opinions are "fabricated." For example, some comrades' criticisms only focus on the latter part of the article, using the latter part to negate the views of his entire article.

　　During the discussion, although the views of the two sides in the debate were very different and the criticism was very sharp, a good atmosphere of academic discussion was maintained, which well reflected the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend."

    中国科学院文学研究所
    讨论关于鲁迅研究和红楼梦研究的论文
    本报讯　中国科学院文学研究所从17日到22日讨论了所内研究人员的部分论文。讨论的第一个中心是关于鲁迅的研究，论文共三篇：陈涌的“为文学艺术的现实主义而斗争的鲁迅”（“人民文学”十月号），蔡仪的“鲁迅论典型”（“文学研究集刊”第四期）”何其芳的“论阿Q”（10月16日人民日报）。讨论的第二个中心是关于红楼梦的研究，论文共两篇：何其芳的“论红楼梦”（尚未发表），曹道衡的“关于黄宗羲、顾炎武、王夫之等人的思想及其与红楼梦的关系”（尚未发表）。参加讨论会的除文学研究所的研究人员外，还有北京大学中文系的部分教授和文艺理论批评家冯友兰、冯雪峰、冯至、杨晦、钱学熙、舒芜和陈秋帆等。
    很多同志认为这些文章是深入研究的成果，像陈涌和蔡仪的文章，是对鲁迅研究的新的贡献。有些是对于某些作品的研究，提出了同流行的观点不同的新的看法，像何其芳的“论阿Q”、“论红楼梦”和曹道衡的文章。
    许多同志都认为“论阿Q”一文在澄清对于研究工作中的教条主义、庸俗社会学的观点上，有着很大的意义。意见的分歧在于对阿Q典型性格的分析。参加讨论的不少同志认为：何其芳同志把阿Q典型性格中的“起着作用”的“最突出的特点”——精神胜利法，看成是类似“人类普通弱点之一种”，存在于不同时代不同阶级的成员身上，是否定了生产阿Q典型性格的特定的社会历史条件，尤其是把阿Q精神胜利法抽象成类似“人类普通弱点之一种”，这实际上是取消了阿Q精神的时代社会内容，使阿Q性格的丰富特征成了阿Q精神的抽象概念。
    在讨论中，何其芳同志也表示了他的意见。他说，文章中有些字句的确写得不够清楚，不够精确。但是，他认为有些同志对他的文章有误解，有些“分歧”的意见是“虚构的”。例如有些同志的批评是只着眼于文章的后一部分，用后一部分来否定他的全文的观点。
   在讨论中，争论双方的观点虽然很分歧，批评虽然很尖锐，却保持着良好的学术讨论的气氛，很好地体现了百家争鸣的方针。
