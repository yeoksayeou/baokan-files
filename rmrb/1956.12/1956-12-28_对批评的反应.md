    Reactions to Criticism
    Construction Preparation Fees Are Not Uniformly 1%
    The criticism in the article "Construction Preparation Fees Are Not Enough" published on page 2 of the People's Daily on December 2nd is not consistent with the actual situation. I am a staff member of the State Construction Commission, and I think it is necessary to explain.
    The article mentioned that "In 1953, the State Construction Commission issued a regulation: the construction preparation fee for new factories -- the wages of construction preparation personnel, travel expenses, etc., is equivalent to 1% of the total investment of the factory..." In fact, that quota was issued in December 1955. The quota for construction unit management fees is also not uniformly 1%, but depends on the size of the project. The proportion for large projects is less, and the percentage of fees charged for small projects is more. In addition, the base for charging fees is not calculated based on the total investment amount. Wu Lin

    Overcoming the Practice of Each Doing Things Their Own Way in Municipal Engineering
    A letter from the Beijing Municipal Engineering Design Institute: The criticism in the article "Is It Negligence or Each Doing Things Their Own Way" on the second page of the October 14th edition is correct for our institute. However, there is a situation that needs to be explained. According to the division of labor of the Beijing municipal construction department, all pipeline and pole line projects within the street area (i.e., between two building red lines) should be reported to our institute by the construction unit first. Our institute will determine the location according to the road plan and phased development; our institute generally notifies the other party of the matters to be noted at the same time as determining the location.

    对批评的反应
    筹建费并非一律是1％
    人民日报12月2日第二版上登载的“筹建费不够用了”一文的批评是不符合实际情况的。我是国家建设委员会的一个工作人员，我认为有必要解释一下。
    文中提到“1953年，国家建设委员会发布了一项规定：新厂的筹建费——筹建人员的工资，出差费等等，相等于这个厂总投资额的1％……”其实，那项定额是1955年12月发出的。建设单位管理费的定额也并非一律是1％，而是视工程规模大小而定，大工程的比例就少，小工程的取费百分比就多。另外，取费的基数也不是按总投资额计算的。　吴琳
    克服市政工程中的各自为政
    北京市市政工程设计院来信：10月14日二版“是疏忽，还是各自为政”一文，对我院的批评是正确的。但是，有一情况需要说明，根据北京市政建设部门分工，凡在街道范围内（即两条建筑红线之间）的管线、杆线工程，全应由建设单位先报我院，由我院按照道路规划和分期发展情况决定位置；我院一般是在决定位置的同时就通知对方应注意的事项。
