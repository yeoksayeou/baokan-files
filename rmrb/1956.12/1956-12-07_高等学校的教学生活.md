	Teaching Life in Universities and Colleges

	Greatly Revitalized Study Life

	Since the beginning of the new semester, Renmin University of China has appropriately streamlined some courses, giving students more time to think about and digest the content taught in class, and to read some reference books, greatly revitalizing study life.

	In the past, students at Renmin University of China, due to the heavy course load, could only browse through their class notes during self-study. The outlines they prepared for classroom discussions were, at best, recitations of articles, unable to transform these articles into their own understanding.

	At the beginning of this semester, except for the Department of Economics, other departments related to finance and economics cancelled the course "Basis of State and Legal Rights"; the Department of Trade cancelled the foreign part of Economic Geography; the Department of Finance changed Industrial Technology to an elective; the Department of Philosophy cancelled Chinese History, and so on. The lecture time for some courses has also been streamlined. For example, the Chinese Revolution History major in the first year originally had twenty-six class hours, which were reduced by four class hours of selected readings in Chinese history; the Political Economy major originally had twenty class hours, which were reduced by four class hours of selected readings in teaching methods. Thus, the weekly courses are generally between eighteen and twenty-four class hours, increasing students' self-study time.

	As a result, many new scenes immediately appeared in the school. Reference books in the library were borrowed by students one after another; the reading room became more crowded. In a quiet environment, some students were thinking about problems alone; some students were fiercely debating something. At some discussion meetings, many insightful speeches from students could be heard; many students have been debating the periodization of modern Chinese history for several months, and it has not ended yet. The students unanimously felt: "In the past, the courses were chasing the students, but now the students are chasing the courses." They are mentally happy, their studies are in-depth, and their lives are more active than before.

	Closer Teacher-Student Relationship

	Since the beginning of this semester, Beijing Medical College has further strengthened the teacher-student relationship by improving teaching methods. In the past, some teachers checked and questioned students too much in class, making the students too nervous and forcing them to be prepared for questions at any time, distracting their attention from listening to lectures; now, appropriate changes have been made, and students can listen to lectures with peace of mind. In the past, when teachers explained anatomy, they only explained the names and functions of each part layer by layer; now, according to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, they pay attention to analyzing the relationship between the specific environment of China and the organism, and explain the differences between organisms. Such teaching methods have been warmly welcomed by students.

	In order to further improve teaching effectiveness and improve the teacher-student relationship, many teachers have participated in students' scientific research groups and conducted scientific research with the students. Teachers from the Physiology Teaching and Research Group and the Chemistry Teaching and Research Group have introduced their scientific research methods and experiences to the students, thus enhancing the students' enthusiasm and confidence in marching towards science. Because the teachers are active and proactive, the teacher-student relationship has been further strengthened. When students encounter problems in their studies, they actively ask the teachers for help. In order to cultivate students' independent thinking and working abilities, teachers often make enlightening speeches at some meetings, guiding them to conduct debates and improve their understanding. Some students in the Department of Physiology also tell their teachers about love problems and strive for more help from the teachers.

	Richer Content of Physical Exercise

	At Beijing Normal University, the number of students active on the sports field is increasing day by day, and the content of exercise is also becoming richer.

	In the past, due to the insistence on uniformity in physical exercise, the hard organization of exercise teams with dozens of people, some students, although with different physiques and interests, were not suitable for participating in that kind of exercise, but they also reluctantly participated. Therefore, some people's exercise effect was not great or not good.

	This semester, the principle of free disposition of after-school time is implemented, and students voluntarily organize various exercise groups according to their personal physical conditions and hobbies. Each group has a certain exercise plan, and students exercise according to the plan of their group. The new exercise method is very suitable for students' requirements. In the past, some people who did not like to participate in exercise now also choose their favorite projects to participate in exercise. A student in the Department of Biology said: "In the past, exercise was often to rush for one item, to race all day long, as if exercising to win a trophy, but now it is really to exercise the body."

	Recently, in order to carry out school-wide winter sports, many new forms have emerged. In order to cultivate and improve students' long-distance running endurance and speed, a long-distance running activity has been launched, running one thousand meters every day, and running five thousand meters in fifty days. This is very popular, and many people participate. Both male and female students can persevere in long-distance running in wind and snow, and no one is willing to interrupt. National defense sports exercise has also become very active recently. The first batch of students in the motorcycle training class has begun learning driving this semester. The students who are preparing to participate in the Beijing Municipal Motorcycle Level 3 Obstacle Race spend time every week to practice, striving to reach the Level 3 athlete standard and obtain better results. Recently, the school has also built a shooting range, and the shooters have conducted several live ammunition shootings. They are working hard to prepare for further development of shooting sports in the future. ·Dai Yue·

### 高等学校的教学生活

　　高等学校的教学生活
    大大活跃了学习生活
    新学年开始以来，中国人民大学适当地精简了一些课程，使学生们有了比较多的时间思考、消化课堂上讲授的内容，并阅读一些参考书，大大活跃了学习生活。
    过去，中国人民大学的学生由于课程负担过重，在自习的时候，只能翻阅一下课堂笔记。他们准备的课堂讨论的发言提纲，最多只是背诵条文，而不能把这些条文变成自己的东西。
    这学期开学时，除了经济系以外，财政经济方面的其他各系都取消了“国家与法权基础”课，贸易系取消了经济地理的外国部分，财政系的工业技术学改成选修，哲学系取消了中国历史，等等。有些课程的讲授时间也精简了。如一年级中国革命史专业原来是二十六学时，减去了中国历史文选四学时；政治经济学专业原来是二十学时，减去了教学法文选四学时。这样每周的课程一般都在十八到二十四学时之间，增加了学生的自学时间。
    这样一来，学校里立刻呈现了许多新景象。图书馆的参考书纷纷被学生们借走了；阅览室里人多起来了。在安静的环境里，有的学生独自在思索问题；有些学生正在激烈地辩论着什么。一些讨论会上，可以听到学生们的很多精辟的发言；许多学生对中国近代史分期问题已经辩论了几个月，现在还没有结束。学生们一致的感觉是：“过去是课程追逐着学生，现在是学生追逐着课程了。”他们精神愉快了，学习深入了，生活也比以前更加活跃起来。
    师生关系进一步密切
    北京医学院这学期开学以来，由于改进教学方法，进一步密切了师生关系。以前有的教师在课堂上过多地对学生抽查、提问，弄得学生们过分紧张，只好随时准备提问，分散了听课的注意力；现在适当作了改变，学生们都能安心听讲了。教师过去讲解剖学，只是一层一层地讲解各部分名称、性能；现在根据苏联的先进经验，注意分析中国具体环境同机体的关系，说明机体间的差异。这样的教学方法，受到学生们的热烈欢迎。
    为了进一步提高教学效果，搞好师生关系，许多教师参加了学生的科学研究小组，同学生们一起进行科学研究。生理学教研组和化学教研组的教师，曾经向学生们介绍了自己的科学研究方法和心得，因而增强了学生们向科学进军的积极性和信心。由于教师积极主动，师生关系进一步密切了，学生在学习中遇到问题，都主动地请教师帮助解决。教师们为了培养学生的独立思考和工作能力，经常在一些会议上作启发性的发言，引导他们进行争论，提高认识水平。生理系有的学生，把恋爱问题也告诉自己的老师，争取老师更多的帮助。
    体育锻炼内容丰富起来
    在北京师范大学里，活跃在运动场上的学生一天比一天多起来，锻炼内容也丰富起来。
    过去在体育锻炼上由于强求一律，硬性组织有好几十人参加的锻炼队，有的学生虽然体质和兴趣不同，不适于参加那种锻炼，但也勉强参加了。因此有的人锻炼效果不大或不好。
    这学期实行课余时间自由支配的原则，学生们根据个人的身体条件和爱好，自觉自愿地组织了各种锻炼小组。各小组有一定的锻炼计划，学生们就根据本组计划进行锻炼。新的锻炼方法很适合学生们的要求，过去有些不爱参加锻炼的人，现在也选择他们喜欢的项目参加锻炼了。生物系一个学生说：“过去锻炼经常是为了突击一项，要赛跑就整天赛跑，好像是为了得锦标而锻炼，现在才真正是为了锻炼身体。”
    最近为了开展全校性的冬季体育运动，又出现了许多新的形式。为了培养和提高学生的长跑耐久力和速度，开展了长跑活动，每天跑一千公尺，五十天跑完五万公尺。这就很受大家欢迎，参加的人很多，男女学生在风雪天都能坚持长跑，谁也不肯间断。国防体育锻炼最近也大为活跃，摩托车训练班本学期第一批学员已开始驾驶课学习。准备参加北京市摩托车三级障碍赛的学生们，每星期都抽出时间练习，争取达到三级运动员标准和获得更好的成绩。最近学校还建成了一个射击场，射击手们已经进行了几次实弹射击。他们正在刻苦练习，为今后进一步开展射击运动作好准备。·戴月·
