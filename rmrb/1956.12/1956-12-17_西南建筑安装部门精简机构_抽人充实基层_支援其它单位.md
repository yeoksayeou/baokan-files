Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 16th - The Southwest construction and installation engineering departments are streamlining their organizations, transferring personnel to strengthen grassroots units and support other units.

In the past month or so, the Southwest Construction First Engineering Bureau and the Third Engineering Bureau have successively transferred more than a thousand employees to construction units in Chengdu that urgently needed personnel. The Southwest Installation Engineering Bureau abolished the Capital Construction Section and merged the Rationalization Proposal Office and the Technical Safety Section into the Construction Management Section. This allowed for the transfer of some technical personnel to strengthen grassroots units and facilitated the correct and rapid handling of engineering technical issues and rationalization proposals. According to statistics from the Southwest Construction Third Engineering Bureau, in the first ten days of the transferred personnel's work, from December 1st to 10th, the state construction plan was overfulfilled.

In the past, the Southwest construction and installation engineering departments had bloated organizations, redundant personnel, chaotic management, and very low work efficiency. Later, they adopted the method of detailed accounting, reviewed the past waste of manpower, and rationally arranged labor based on this year's completion projects and next year's construction plans. Currently, the Southwest Construction First Engineering Bureau and the Third Engineering Bureau are also preparing to take further measures, such as increasing simple construction machinery, to further unleash the potential of employees and transfer more workers to support other construction departments in December.

    西南建筑安装部门精简机构
    抽人充实基层　支援其它单位
    据新华社成都16日电　西南建筑安装工程部门精简机构，调出人员充实基层单位和支援其它单位。
    在最近一个多月里，西南建筑第一工程处和第三工程处陆续抽调了一千多个职工，分配到成都市迫切需要人的建筑单位。西南安装工程处撤销了基本建设科，并且把合理化建议办公室和技术安全科合并到施工管理科。这样，既能抽调部分技术人员充实基层单位，又便于正确和迅速地处理工程技术问题和合理化建议。据西南建筑第三工程处的统计，在12月1日到10日，调出人员的头十天中，超额完成了国家建筑计划。
    西南建筑安装工程部门过去机构臃肿，人浮于事，管理混乱，工作效率很低。后来他们采用算细账的办法，检查了过去人力浪费情况，又根据今年收尾工程和明年建设计划，合理安排了劳动力。现在，西南建筑第一工程处和第三工程处还准备继续采取措施，如增加简单施工机械等，进一步发挥职工潜力，在12月份再抽调一些工人支援其它建筑部门。
