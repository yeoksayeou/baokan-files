Xinhua News Agency, 26th. Beijing - More than 1,000 people from all walks of life in Beijing gathered at the Capital Cinema this afternoon to warmly celebrate the Egyptian people's recovery of Port Said and the withdrawal of Anglo-French aggressor troops from Egypt.

    Burhan, President of the Sino-Egyptian Friendship Association, spoke at the celebration. He said that the Anglo-French aggressors had been forced to withdraw their last invading soldier from Egypt on the evening of December 22, announcing a shameful defeat to the world. This is not only a great victory for the Egyptian people, but also a great victory for peace-loving people all over the world. Let us extend our warm fraternal salute to the heroic Egyptian people, especially the heroic people of Port Said!

    Burhan said that struggle is the most precious test of friendship. After being tested by this struggle, the people of China and Egypt have mutually confirmed that we are not only brothers in adversity, but also brothers fighting shoulder to shoulder against the aggressors with unwavering determination. The victory of our Egyptian brothers is our victory.

    Burhan pointed out that although the aggressors have been forced to retreat, their aggressive ambitions have not died. The imperialists' conspiracies to infringe upon the sovereignty of the Suez Canal and their dreams of controlling the Middle East are still being carried out secretly and in the dark. He said that the United Nations police force should withdraw from Egypt immediately after completing its mission of supervising the withdrawal of troops. Any conspiracy to interfere with Egypt's exercise of sovereignty must be crushed! Any imperialist conspiracy to control the Middle East must be crushed!

    Burhan concluded: Although victory has been achieved, the struggle is not over. The Anglo-French aggressors must immediately stop their aggression and compensate Egypt for all the losses suffered in the war. We and the people of the world must redouble our vigilance and continue to resolutely support the Egyptian people's struggle for final and complete victory.

    After reading the congratulatory telegram from Burhan, President of the Sino-Egyptian Friendship Association, to President Nasser, the "Support Egypt Long-Distance Running Team" of the Beijing Iron and Steel Institute, composed of forty students, ran into the venue to congratulate the Egyptian people on their victory. The long-distance running team handed over a letter to President Nasser and forwarded to all Egyptian youth, and a banner dedicated to the people of Port Said to Ragheb, the Egyptian Ambassador to China. The banner read: "We will always be with you." At this time, the audience burst into thunderous and lasting applause.

    The students of Beijing Iron and Steel Institute, after the Anglo-French imperialists launched a war of aggression against Egypt, organized the "Support Egypt Long-Distance Running Team" in the whole school in order to exercise and prepare to support the Egyptian people's anti-aggression war when necessary. 85% of the students in the school participated in the long-distance running exercise. At today's meeting, Ambassador Ragheb presented prizes to the winning teams and individuals who participated in the long-distance running exercise in the institute.

    Then, Ragheb, the Egyptian Ambassador to China, spoke. The ambassador expressed his deep gratitude to the Chinese people on behalf of the Egyptian government and people for their practical support to the Egyptian people. He said that this practical support has had a great impact on raising the morale of the Egyptian people against the evil aggressors and consolidating the friendly relations between China and Egypt.

    The ambassador also said that the victory of the Egyptian people in repelling the aggressors is an echo of the call of the great Chinese people, and also an echo of the wise policy of the Chinese People's Government in consolidating peace and friendship that is followed by people all over the world.

    Ragheb's speech was received with extreme enthusiasm. At the end of his speech, the audience stood up and applauded for a long time. Ragheb embraced Burhan excitedly.

    After the celebration, the films "Port Said in Struggle" and "Battle in the Valley," which depicted the heroic struggle of the Egyptian people, were shown.

    Today's celebration was organized by the Sino-Egyptian Friendship Association. Da Punsheng, Vice President of the Sino-Egyptian Friendship Association, and members of the board, as well as staff from the Egyptian Embassy in China and Egyptian friends in Beijing, attended the celebration.

    北京各界集会庆祝埃及人民的胜利
    要求英法侵略者赔偿埃及的损失
    新华社26日讯　北京各界人民一千多人今天下午在首都电影院集会，热烈庆祝埃及人民光复塞得港和英法侵略军撤出埃及。
    中埃友好协会会长包尔汉在庆祝会上讲话。他说，英法侵略者已经被迫在12月22日的晚上撤退了在埃及的最后一个侵略兵，向全世界宣布了可耻的失败。这不仅是埃及人民伟大的胜利，而且是全世界爱好和平人民的伟大胜利。让我们向英勇的埃及人民，特别是英雄的塞得港人民致以热烈的兄弟的敬礼！
    包尔汉说，斗争是友谊最珍贵的考验。经过这次斗争的考验，中埃两国人民互相证实了我们不仅是患难相共的兄弟，而且是肩并肩地向侵略者进行坚决不屈的斗争的兄弟。埃及兄弟的胜利，就是我们的胜利。
    包尔汉指出，侵略者虽然被迫撤退了，但是侵略野心并没有死掉。帝国主义者们侵犯苏伊士运河主权和梦想控制中近东的阴谋还在暗地里见不得人地进行着。他说，联合国警察部队应该在迅速完成监督撤军的任务以后立即撤出埃及。任何打算干涉埃及行使主权的阴谋必须粉碎！任何梦想控制中近东的帝国主义阴谋必须粉碎！
    包尔汉最后说：胜利虽然已经取得了，但是斗争并没有结束。英法侵略者必须立即停止他们的侵略阴谋并赔偿埃及在战争中所受的一切损失。我们和全世界人民还必须加倍提高警惕，继续坚决支持埃及人民为争取最后的彻底的胜利而进行的斗争。
    在宣读了中埃友好协会会长包尔汉致纳赛尔总统的贺电后，由四十名学生组成的北京钢铁工业学院“支援埃及长跑队”跑步进入会场，来祝贺埃及人民的胜利。长跑队把一封致纳赛尔总统并转埃及全体青年的信和一面献给塞得港人民的锦旗交给埃及驻中国大使拉加卜。锦旗上写着：“我们永远和你们在一起”。这时候，全场掌声雷动，经久不息。
    北京钢铁工业学院的学生们，在英法帝国主义者发动侵略埃及战争以后，为了锻炼身体准备在必要的时候去支援埃及人民反侵略战争，曾在全校组织了“支援埃及长跑队”，全校85％的学生都参加了长跑锻炼。在今天的大会上，拉加卜大使向这个学院参加长跑锻炼的优胜队和个人发了奖品。
    接着，埃及驻中国大使拉加卜讲话。这位大使代表埃及政府和人民向中国人民致以深深的感激，感激中国人民给埃及人民的实际支援。他说，这种实际的支援，在提高埃及人民反对罪恶的侵略者的士气中和巩固中埃两国友好关系上起了巨大的影响。
    这位大使还说，埃及人民在击退侵略者中所获得的胜利，就是伟大中国人民的呼声的回声，也是中国人民政府在全世界人民中所遵循的巩固和平和友好的英明政策的回声。
    拉加卜的讲话受到极其热烈的欢迎。在他讲话结束时，全场起立长久地鼓掌。拉加卜激动地同包尔汉拥抱在一起。
    庆祝会后，放映了描写埃及人民英勇斗争的影片“斗争中的塞得港”和“山谷中的战斗”。
    今天的庆祝会是由中埃友好协会举办的。中埃友协副会长达浦生和理事们以及埃及驻中国大使馆人员和在北京的埃及友人们出席了庆祝会。
