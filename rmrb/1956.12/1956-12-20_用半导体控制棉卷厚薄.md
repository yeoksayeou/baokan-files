    Using Semiconductors to Control Cotton Lap Thickness

    This newspaper reports: Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 8 is experimenting with using semiconductors to control the amount of cotton stored in the cotton boxes.

    This semiconductor device was successfully developed by Rong Yongbao, Liu Anlin, and Ni Yaoliang, electrical technicians at the factory. It can keep the cotton stored in the cotton box within a certain limit at all times, making the first cotton laps produced uniformly thick, and the yarn spun more evenly. As a result of using semiconductors, the unevenness rate of the cotton laps at this factory has been reduced from 1.76% to about 1.25%.

    Currently, the factory's technicians and electrical workers are continuing their research and plan to apply it to weaving machines. (According to Jiefang Daily)

    用半导体控制棉卷厚薄
    本报讯　上海国棉八厂试用半导体来控制棉箱储棉量。
    这个半导体设备是由这个厂的技术人员荣永宝、刘安林和电气技工倪耀良研究成功的。它可以使棉箱内贮存的棉花始终保持一定的限度，做出的头道棉卷厚薄均匀，纺出的纱也较均匀。使用半导体的结果，这个厂棉卷的不均匀率由1.76％降低到1.25％左右。
    现在，厂内技术人员和电气工正在继续研究，准备把它应用到织布机上去。　　（据解放日报）
