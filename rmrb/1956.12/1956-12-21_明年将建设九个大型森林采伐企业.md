Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch: China will build nine large-scale forest logging enterprises next year. Construction preparations for these new enterprises have already begun.

Hundreds of technicians are currently working intensively on the designs for these new enterprises, which will be distributed across the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains forest areas, the Changbai Mountain forest area, and some forest areas in Sichuan Province. The Greater Khingan Mountains are China's largest forest area, with an estimated forest reserve of at least 700 million cubic meters. Once the two new enterprises being constructed there next year are completed, they will provide the country with more than 2.5 million cubic meters of timber annually. The Lesser Khingan Mountains are famous for producing Korean pine and are currently China's largest timber-producing area. After the two new enterprises to be built there next year are completed, the timber produced in this forest area will increase from the current 2.4 million cubic meters to more than 3 million cubic meters annually. Currently, the railway lines connecting these new enterprises are either beginning to be laid or are being prepared for construction.

However, it will take a considerable amount of time for these new enterprises to fully realize their effect. According to relevant departments of the Ministry of Forestry Industry, most of these enterprises are located in the cold north, with only four to five months of construction time each year. The areas are remote, transportation is inconvenient, the supply of materials is quite difficult, and the amount of engineering is very large. The planned forest railways to be built in the dense forests alone total more than 2,000 kilometers. Therefore, it will take a total of five to six years for a new enterprise, from surveying and design to construction and full production capacity.

### 明年将建设九个大型森林采伐企业

    明年将建设九个大型森林采伐企业
    据新华社20日讯　我国明年将兴建九个大型森林采伐企业。这些新企业的施工准备工作已经开始。
    由几百名技术人员正在加紧设计的这批新企业，分布在大、小兴安岭林区、长白山林区以及四川省一些林区。大兴安岭是我国最大的林区，估计那里的森林蓄积量至少在七亿立方公尺左右，明年在那里施工的两个新企业完工以后，每年将为国家提供二百五十万立方公尺以上的木材。小兴安岭以盛产红松著名，是我国目前最大的木材产地，明年兴建的两个新企业完工以后，这个林区每年生产的木材将由目前的二百四十万立方公尺增加到三百多万立方公尺。现在，连接这些新企业的铁路线，有的已经开始铺轨，有的正在准备建筑。
    但是这批新企业完全发挥它们的效果，还需要一个相当长的时间。据森林工业部有关方面说，这些企业大部分分布在寒冷的北方，每年只有四、五个月的施工期，地区荒僻、交通不便，物资供应相当困难，而工程量却很大，单是计划在密林里修建的森林铁路就有两千多公里。因此，一个新建企业从勘察设计、施工到完全发挥生产能力，总共需要五年到六年的时间。
