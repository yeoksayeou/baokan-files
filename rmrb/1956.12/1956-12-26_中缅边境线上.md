    On the Sino-Burmese Border
    Our correspondents Zhang Jiecun and Qin Junguang
    On December 1st, we set off from Kunming, traveling southwest along the滇缅 (Dianmian) Highway for more than 950 kilometers, and arrived at the town of Wanding. Wanding is the southern terminus of the Dianmian Highway, separated from Burma only by the small Wanding River, with a small bridge spanning the river. Local residents told us that every morning many Burmese border residents cross the Wanding Bridge to buy groceries in the town; residents of Wanding also often cross the bridge to go to the market. In the evening, Burmese border residents sometimes come over to play ball with us. During this year's National Day, four to five hundred Burmese border residents came to join us in celebrations.
    Traveling west from Wanding for more than 30 li (Chinese mile), after crossing the Ruili River ferry, one reaches the territory of Ruili County. The Ruili River comes down from the north, and turns southwest here, lying on the border between China and Burma. The river flows slowly, and on the broad river surface, there are often two or three narrow, long boats ferrying border residents back and forth. Wild ducks swim freely on the river; when they encounter a small boat, they calmly move to the side. These wild ducks, because they live on the border between the two countries, neither side's border residents disturbs them so as not to startle the neighboring country, so they are not afraid of people. On the riverbank, herds of water buffalo and cattle graze, some herds with young herdsmen tending them with small slingshots, some herds completely unattended; they won't get lost here.
    When we arrived in Zhele Township, what unfolded before our eyes were Dai villages, each surrounded by large banyan trees and bamboo forests, blooming with various flowers everywhere. "Man Shanpo" is ripe, and pomelos hang full on the branches. Unnamed birds chirp and play in the bamboo groves. In the fields, piles of freshly cut grain are stacked, filling the air with a peaceful and tranquil atmosphere. Here, 90% of the farmers have already been organized, and this year the entire township has again achieved a bumper harvest.
    In Zhele Village, we visited the largest Golden Pagoda in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture. The dazzling golden pagoda towers high, surrounded by sixteen smaller pagodas, appearing extremely majestic and magnificent. It is said that this pagoda has a history of 450 years, and whenever there is a "Da Bai" (major Dharma assembly), in addition to the Dai people from nearby counties, monks and pious men and women from Namhkam, Lashio, and Yangon in Burma also come to worship. In the past, the Burmese called Ruili "Guozhanbi," meaning "the place where the Buddha is," and they often came here to celebrate the "Da Bai" with the Dai people.
    Many border residents here have relatives among the border residents of Burma. A farmer named Han Liang told us that his grandmother and aunt are both in Burma, and his wife often buys things to visit them. As soon as she arrives there, Burmese neighbors ask her all sorts of questions, very warmly.
    We arrived at Guangshuang Village, a village jointly inhabited by border residents from both China and Burma. Houses are connected to houses, bamboo tips touching bamboo tips, making it difficult for those unfamiliar with the village to distinguish which is Chinese and which is Burmese. In this village, although both China and Burma each have a well, when there is a water shortage, everyone puts aside such distinctions, and when our well has no water, we go to the Burmese well to draw water, and when the Burmese well has no water, they come to our well to draw water. Here, it is currently the harvest season, and border residents from both sides are working on the fertile land. Young men and women sometimes sing folk songs to each other. When they are tired from work, they smoke, drink water, and chat about everyday life together. Children also play happily together.
    In He Sai, Chinese and Burmese border residents jointly built a ditch, and border residents of both countries jointly drink water from the same ditch and jointly use water from the same ditch to irrigate the lands of both countries.
    The border residents of China and Burma are friends, relatives, and neighbors. They have coexisted peacefully in the past and present, and they will coexist even more peacefully in the future.

    中缅边境线上
    本报记者　章皆淳　秦军光
    12月1日，我们从昆明出发，沿着滇缅公路西南行九百五十多公里，来到了畹町镇。畹町是滇缅公路南段的终点，和缅甸只隔一条小小的畹町河，河上架着一座小桥。这里的居民告诉我们：每天早晨都有许多缅甸的边民，经过这座畹町桥到镇上来买小菜；畹町镇的居民也常过桥去赶街。傍晚，缅甸边民有时还过来和我们一道打球。今年国庆节，有四、五百缅甸边民来同我们联欢。
    从畹町西行三十多里，过了瑞丽江渡口，就到了瑞丽县境。瑞丽江从北面下来，到这里拐向西南流，它处在中缅的边界上。江水缓缓地流着，宽广的江面上不时有三两只又窄又长的小船摆渡来往的边民。野鸭在江面上自由嬉游，遇到小船就不慌不忙地靠向一边。这些野鸭因为生长在两国的边界上，双方的边民为了不惊动邻邦，谁也不去打它们，于是它们见人也不害怕了。在江畔，成群的水牛、黄牛吃着草，有些牛群有牧童拿着小弹弓放牧，有些牛群根本没有人管，在这里是不会丢失的。
    我们来到遮勒乡的时候，展现在我们眼前的是一个个被大青树、大竹林环抱着的傣族寨子，遍处盛开着各种鲜花。“曼山坡”熟了，柚子挂满枝头。那不知名的小鸟吱吱喳喳地在竹丛中嬉戏。田野里堆着一堆堆刚刚割下的谷子，充满了一片和平宁静的气氛。这里，90％的农民已经组织起来了，今年全乡又获得了大丰收。
    在遮勒寨，我们参观了德宏傣族景颇族自治州最大的大金塔。金黄耀眼的大塔在十六个小塔的环抱中高耸着，显得十分雄伟壮丽。据说这塔已有四百五十年的历史，每逢大摆（做大法会）的时候，除附近各县的傣族人民外，缅甸的南坎、腊戌和仰光等地的和尚和善男信女也赶来朝拜。过去缅甸人把瑞丽叫做“果占毕”，意思就是佛在的地方，他们常来这里和傣族人民一道赶大摆。
    这里许多边民和缅甸的边民有着亲戚的关系。一个名叫罕良的农民对我们说，他的祖母和姑姑都在缅甸，他妻子常买些东西去看她们。一到那边，缅甸邻居就找她问长问短，亲热得很。
    我们来到了广双寨，这是中缅两国边民合居的一个寨子。房子连着房子，竹梢搭着竹梢，不熟悉这寨子的人，很难分出哪个是中国的，哪个是缅甸的。在这个寨子里，虽然中缅两方都各有一口井，但到缺水的时候，大家也就不分彼此，我方的井没有水的时候就到缅方的井里去打，缅方的井没有水的时候也到我方的井里来打。这里，现在正是收割的季节，双方的边民各自在肥沃的土地上劳动着。青年男女们有时对唱着山歌。工作累了，就一道吸吸烟，喝喝水，说说家常。小孩子们也在一起快乐地玩耍着。
    在和赛，中缅双方边民一道修了一条水沟，两国边民共同饮用着一条沟的水，共同用一条沟的水来灌溉两国的土地。
    中缅两国的边民，是朋友，是亲戚，也是邻居。他们过去和现在都友好地相处着，将来会更友好地相处下去。
