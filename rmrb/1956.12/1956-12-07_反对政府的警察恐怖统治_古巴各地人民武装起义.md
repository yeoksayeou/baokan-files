　　Against the Government's Police Terror
　　Cuban People's Armed Uprisings in Various Places
    Xinhua News Agency, December 5th dispatch from Havana: Armed insurgents in Santiago City, eastern Cuba, who rose up against the Batista government on November 30th, are still fighting government troops. On December 4th, insurgents in Guanito, Pinar del Río province in southeastern Cuba, attacked the local army outpost and fought government troops in the nearby mountains.
    On the 3rd, another insurgent force landed in Manzanillo, Oriente province, on the southeastern coast of Cuba. Government war reports said that government planes strafed the area, resulting in forty casualties. The government hurriedly dispatched the army to the landing area.
    This armed uprising was launched by a political group led by Fidel Castro. Castro was formerly a student leader and went into exile in Mexico after the failure of his movement against the Batista government in July 1953.
    According to foreign news agencies, in the past few days, armed insurgents and government troops have engaged in fierce fighting in eastern Cuba. In Santiago City, the two sides fought for a whole day on December 2nd. Armed conflicts have also occurred in other cities.
    It is reported that the political situation in Cuba has been very tense since this period, due to the Cuban government's refusal to hold general elections in 1957 and the implementation of police terror at home. Now, in addition to armed conflicts in Oriente Province and Pinar del Río Province, there are also anti-government actions in Camagüey Province and Santa Clara Province.
    Currently, the Batista government has revoked constitutionally guaranteed rights in four of Cuba's six provinces. Government troops and police are conducting house-to-house searches for "suspects" in Santiago and other places, and arresting opposition figures throughout the country.
    [Editor's note] Cuba is an island country in the West Indies of the western Atlantic, with an area of ​​more than 110,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately six million. Cuba's economy is almost entirely dominated by US monopoly capital, and Cuba's politics are actually under the control of the United States. In March 1952, the United States supported Batista in launching a coup and establishing a reactionary government. This government pursued a policy of betraying national interests, suppressed the people's democratic freedoms domestically, and implemented police terror rule; externally, it followed the US Cold War policy and even severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. In the November 1954 election, Batista became president again with the help of bayonets and police batons. Afterwards, he intensified his reactionary and independent path. The Cuban people could no longer endure it, and finally launched an armed uprising.

    反对政府的警察恐怖统治
　　古巴各地人民武装起义
    新华社5日讯　哈瓦那消息：11月30日在古巴东部圣地亚哥城发生的反对巴蒂斯塔政府的武装起义者仍然同政府军队作战。12月4日，起义者在古巴东南部比纳德里约省的瓜尼托攻击了当地的陆军据点，并且在附近山区和政府军队作战。
    3日又有一支起义队伍在古巴东南海岸奥连特省的曼萨尼罗登陆，政府的战报说，政府的飞机扫射了这个地区，有四十个人伤亡。政府连忙派陆军到登陆地区去。
    这次武装起义是由费德尔·卡斯特罗领导的一个政治团体发动的。卡斯特罗从前是学生领袖，他在1953年7月反对巴蒂斯塔政府的运动失败后流亡墨西哥。
    据外国通讯社报道，在过去几天里，武装起义者和政府军在古巴东部地区展开了激烈的战斗。在圣地亚哥城，双方在12月2日战斗了一整天。其他城市也发生了武装冲突。
    据报道，由于古巴政府拒绝在1957年举行普选，并且在国内实行警察恐怖统治，这个时期以来，古巴国内的政治形势十分紧张。现在除了在奥连特省和比纳德里约省有武装冲突以外，在卡马圭省和圣太克拉拉省也有反政府的行动。
    目前巴蒂斯塔政府已经在古巴全部六个省中的四个省取消了宪法规定的权利。政府军队和警察正在圣地亚哥和其他地方挨户搜索“嫌疑人物”，并且在全国各地逮捕反对派人士。
    〔编者注〕古巴是大西洋西部西印度群岛中的一个岛国，面积约十一万多平方公里，人口约六百万。古巴的经济几乎全受美国垄断资本所支配，古巴的政治实际上也是在美国的控制之下。美国在1952年3月支持巴蒂斯塔发动政变，成立了反动的政府。这个政府奉行着叛卖民族利益的政策，对内压制人民的民主自由，实行警察恐怖统治；对外追随美国冷战政策，甚至同苏联断绝了外交关系。1954年11月举行选举，巴蒂斯塔凭了刺刀和警棍的帮助，又当上了总统。以后更变本加厉地走上反动独立的道路。古巴人民忍无可忍，最近终于发动了武装起义。
