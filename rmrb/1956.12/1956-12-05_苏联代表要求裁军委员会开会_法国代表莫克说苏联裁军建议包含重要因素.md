Xinhua News Agency, December 4th, New York Dispatch: Soviet representative to the United Nations, Sobolev, wrote to the chairman of the Disarmament Committee on December 3rd, requesting that the committee hold a meeting within a few days. The letter stated that in view of the importance and urgency of the disarmament issue on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly, the committee should hold a meeting to consider its report submitted to the Security Council and the General Assembly this year.

Xinhua News Agency, December 4th, TASS, Paris Dispatch: French representative to the United Nations Disarmament Committee, Moch, said at a banquet of the Foreign Correspondents Association in Paris that when international tensions increase, efforts should be made to resolve the disarmament issue.

Referring to the Soviet government's statement on disarmament and the easing of international tensions, Moch pointed out that the Soviet government's agreement to consider aerial photography within a region of 800 kilometers east and west of the demarcation line between the armed forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty member states is an "important factor." Moch opposed the abolition of military bases of various countries on foreign territories "at this stage." Moch also believes that negotiations must be resumed. However, he said, "not negotiations at the level of the five major powers, but negotiations within the scope of the United Nations."

　　苏联代表要求裁军委员会开会
　  法国代表莫克说苏联裁军建议包含重要因素
    新华社4日讯　纽约消息：苏联驻联合国代表索波列夫12月3日写信给裁军委员会主席，要求委员会在数天内举行会议。这封信说，鉴于在联合国大会议程上的裁军问题的重要性和迫切性，委员会应该举行会议来考虑它今年向安全理事会和大会提出的报告。
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社巴黎4日讯：法国常驻联合国裁军委员会代表莫克在巴黎的外国新闻工作者协会的宴会上说，当国际紧张局势加剧的时候，应设法解决裁军问题。
    莫克在谈到苏联政府关于裁军和缓和国际紧张局势问题的声明时指出，苏联政府同意考虑在北大西洋集团和华沙条约成员国武装力量的分界线东、西各八百公里以内的地区实行空中摄影一点是一个“重要的因素”。莫克反对在“现阶段”撤消各国在外国领土上的军事基地。莫克还认为必须恢复谈判。但是，他说，“不是五大国一级的谈判，而是在联合国范围内的谈判。”
