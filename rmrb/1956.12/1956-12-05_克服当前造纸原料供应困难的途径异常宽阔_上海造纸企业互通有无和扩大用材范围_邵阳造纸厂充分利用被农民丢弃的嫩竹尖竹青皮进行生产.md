Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 4th. More than twenty paper mills in Shanghai have strengthened inter-factory coordination and mutual support in raw materials, and strived to open up new sources of raw materials, increasing paper production by more than 2,500 tons in the three months from September to November. It is estimated that with the possible increase in December, the shortfall in the plan that was not completed from May to August this year can be made up; the annual paper production plan can also be completed.

In the fourth quarter of this year, Shanghai's paper output will account for almost one-third of the annual plan. However, in these months, the reserve of papermaking raw materials has been greatly reduced compared to the beginning of the year, and many problems have also occurred with external raw materials. In September, the Shanghai Paper Industry Company took a series of measures to overcome the difficulty of raw material supply, especially mobilizing factories to support and help each other. Some factories with steaming equipment have recently given raw materials such as waste paper, which do not require steaming and are ready for immediate use, to factories that do not have steaming equipment, and used more grass pulp that requires steaming themselves. Lihua Paper Mill used the method of increasing the utilization rate of steaming equipment and shortening the steaming time to increase the output of rice straw pulp for its own use, and at the same time supported other paper mills with many reeds pulp it saved to increase production.

In the most difficult November, various factories also expanded the scope of using substitute raw materials under mutual coordination. This month, the amount of raw materials such as rice straw and rags was increased in the raw material ratio of eighteen kinds of paper.

According to the inspection of the Central Laboratory of the Paper Industry Company, after Shanghai has recently made extensive use of raw materials such as rags, waste paper, and rice straw, the quality of the paper is only slightly worse in appearance, but otherwise remains the same as in the past.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 4th. The local state-owned Shaoyang Paper Mill uses tender bamboo tips and green bamboo skin discarded by farmers as raw materials to make offset printing paper and office paper, which not only solves the problem of lack of papermaking raw materials and reduces papermaking costs, but also opens up a source of income for farmers. The offset printing paper and office paper made by Shaoyang Paper Mill using bamboo tips as raw materials are of the same quality as paper made from bamboo fiber.

Bamboo material accounts for 60% to 80% of the papermaking raw materials used by Shaoyang Paper Mill. In the past, these bamboo materials were generally made of bamboo fiber from tender bamboo. Since the second half of this year, it has encountered the difficulty of lack of bamboo fiber. The workers came up with many ways to find substitutes for bamboo fiber. In September, the workers, referring to the experience of other factories in processing green bamboo, used the bamboo tips and green bamboo skin discarded by farmers when making bamboo fiber and native paper in the past to replace bamboo fiber for papermaking, and achieved success.

According to the amount of bamboo fiber purchased by this factory this year, the entire factory will be short of bamboo material raw materials for more than half a year before the new bamboo fiber is available on the market in July and August next year. Now this factory has purchased enough bamboo tips and green bamboo skin for more than half a year before July and August next year. The price of bamboo tips and green bamboo skin is about three-quarters cheaper than bamboo fiber.

    克服当前造纸原料供应困难的途径异常宽阔
    上海造纸企业互通有无和扩大用材范围
　　邵阳造纸厂充分利用被农民丢弃的嫩竹尖竹青皮进行生产
    新华社上海4日电　上海二十多个造纸厂加强厂际之间原料的相互调剂和支援，努力开辟新的原料来源，在9月到11月的三个月内增产了二千五百多吨纸张。预计加上12月份可能增产的数字，今年5月到8月没有完成计划的缺额部分可以得到弥补；全年纸张的生产计划也可以完成。
    今年第四季度，上海纸张的产量几乎要占到全年计划的三分之一。但是在这几个月中，造纸原料的储备比年初大大减少，外来原料也发生了许多问题。9月份，上海造纸工业公司采取一系列的措施来克服原料的供应困难，特别是发动各厂互相支援和帮助。有些有蒸煮设备的工厂，最近都把不需要蒸煮立即可用的废纸等原料，让给没有蒸煮设备的工厂去用，自己多用需要蒸煮的草浆。利华造纸厂用提高蒸煮设备的利用率和缩短蒸煮时间的办法，来增加稻草浆的产量供本厂使用，同时把自己省下来的许多苇浆支援了别的纸厂去增产。
    在最困难的11月份，各厂在相互调剂下还扩大使用代用原料的范围。这个月，有十八种纸张的原料配比中，增加了稻草、破布等原料的用量。
    据造纸工业公司中心试验室检查，上海最近大量利用破布、废纸、稻草等原料以后，纸张的质量除了外观上稍为差一点以外，其他仍然同过去一样。
    新华社长沙4日电　地方国营邵阳造纸厂利用农民废弃的嫩竹尖子、竹青皮作原料，造胶版纸和办公纸，不但解决了造纸原料缺乏的问题，降低了造纸成本，而且也为农民开辟了收入来源。邵阳造纸厂用竹尖子作原料造出来的胶版纸和办公纸，质量赶得上用竹麻丝造的纸。
    邵阳造纸厂所用的造纸原料，竹料占60％到80％，这些竹料过去一般是用嫩竹子做的竹麻丝。今年下半年以来，遇到了竹麻丝缺乏的困难，职工们便想出许多办法找竹麻丝代用品。9月间，职工们参照别的工厂处理脱青竹的经验，采用过去农民做竹麻丝和土纸的时候丢弃的竹尖子和竹青皮代替竹麻丝造纸，获得成功。
    按照这个厂今年收购的竹麻丝的数量，全厂明年7、8月间新竹麻丝上市以前，要缺半个多年头的竹料原料。现在这个工厂已经收购了足够明年7、8月以前半年多用的竹尖子、竹青皮。竹尖子、竹青皮的价钱比竹麻丝要便宜四分之三左右。
