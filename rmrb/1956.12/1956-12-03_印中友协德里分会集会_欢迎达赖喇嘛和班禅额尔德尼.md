    在他们讲话以前，印中友好协会德里分会主席腊达·腊曼在致欢迎词时说，达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的来访满足了印度人民希望看到西藏这两位伟大人物的宿愿，同时会加强印中两国人民之间的友谊。
    在达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼到达的时候，社会名流给他们戴上了花环。
    在二百五十名来宾中，有全印和平理事会主席克其鲁博士，印中友好协会主席森德拉尔和国会人民院副议长萨达尔·胡卡姆·辛格。以喜饶嘉错为首的中国佛教代表团也出席了这次欢迎会。
    当天上午，达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼访问了德里附近的乡村发展计划中心尼洛克里和卡纳尔。他们还欣赏和观看了儿童乐队、民间音乐、集体舞蹈和村庄展览会。他们对各种训练部门的工作感到兴趣。千百个男女和儿童把玫瑰花瓣撒到他们身上。为了表示对印度儿童的爱，他们替两个印度男孩起了西藏名字——桑都泽林（万事如意和长寿的意思）和塔希丰错（处处交好运的意思）。
