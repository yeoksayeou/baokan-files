　　Argument Caused by Counting Mosquitoes
　　Zhong Huai
　　Not long ago, the Qingyang Daily in Qingyang County, Anhui Province, published an article entitled "What's the Use of Such Figures?" The original article is not long and is reproduced below:
　　　　At eight o'clock in the afternoon of July 26th, the telephone rang in the Agricultural Bureau, startling Comrade Zhai who was sitting at his desk.
　　　　"Hello?" Comrade Zhai habitually picked up the phone and asked.
　　　　"This is the Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Office," the other party replied forcefully. "How is your Four Pests Elimination campaign going lately?"
　　　　"Yesterday, our office conducted a major cleaning, spraying DDT and creosol, killing many flies, mosquitoes and fly larvae," Comrade Zhai honestly reported the recent sanitation work.
　　　　"Ah, then report the figures!" the other party said, both happily and commandingly, stating the purpose of his call.
　　　　"What? Figures!" Comrade Zhai scratched his head in embarrassment. But he had to explain the situation to the other party: "Hey, we didn't count or weigh the things we killed, how can we report it!"
　　　　"Well... just estimate it, you can't do without figures!" the other party's tone seemed somewhat softened.
　　　　"Okay! You write this down! 860 flies, 450 mosquitoes, 11 liang of fly larvae," Comrade Zhai reported. The other party was of course very happy. But the people listening to the call next to Comrade Zhai burst into laughter.
　　　　Comrade Zhai put down the phone and sighed deeply, "Good heavens! This is simply forcing people to lie!"
　　According to the Qingyang Daily editorial department, disputes like the one about counting mosquitoes mentioned in the article above occur from time to time in the Four Pests Elimination campaign. This article precisely expresses the opinions of many people. Many members of agricultural cooperatives have said: "Instead of spending time counting mosquitoes, I'd rather sleep a little longer."
　　However, after the article was published, it also aroused different reactions. Some readers wrote letters criticizing the Qingyang Daily for publishing this article. According to this reader, "Why couldn't you count or weigh the things you killed at the time?" "Of course, estimated figures are not accurate enough. But including estimated figures in the total number of the county's Four Pests Elimination campaign is more accurate than not including any figures at all. In this case, what's wrong with asking Comrade Zhai to make an estimate?"
　　Therefore, this reader believes: "If Comrade Zhai himself didn't keep track of the figures, it can only be said that he doesn't have a strong sense of responsibility in his work, how can he blame the other party for asking him for the figures?"
　　The Qingyang County Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Office also wrote a letter to the Qingyang Daily. They admitted that it was wrong to ask the Agricultural Bureau to estimate the figures casually, but figures still need to be tallied. However, in the future, they will use a published reporting method (reporting once every five days) to replace calling for figures.
　　This puts the Qingyang Daily in a difficult position: Is it necessary to count the mosquitoes and flies that have been killed? "The county health department doesn't tally the figures, which doesn't meet the requirements of the higher authorities; but if we do tally them, the masses have opinions." They said this in a letter to a Beijing newspaper, and asked the newspaper to help them solve this problem.
　　In order to find out whether the leading organs have such regulations, and what the leading organs think about this matter, this newspaper wrote a letter to the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee. It received a reply not long ago. The letter said: "The Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee has not stipulated statistical methods for flies and mosquitoes after they have been killed. We are still studying what method to use for statistics."
　　It is conceivable that if the reply from the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee is conveyed to the comrades in Qingyang County, this debate over counting mosquitoes will still not be over. Because this reply did not answer the question of whether or not to count mosquitoes, but only said: "We are still studying how to tally the figures."
　　Counting mosquitoes is not a new thing, and the disputes caused by counting mosquitoes, flies, maggots, rat tails... are not just one or two. But what are the real benefits of counting mosquitoes? What are the real disadvantages of not counting mosquitoes? Is it really impossible to promote the Patriotic Health Campaign or check the achievements of the Patriotic Health Campaign unless you count mosquitoes? Isn't it time to draw a clear conclusion on these issues today?

### 数蚊子引起的争论

　　数蚊子引起的争论
　　钟怀
    安徽青阳县的青阳报在不久以前发表了一篇文章，题目是“这样的数字有什么用”。原文不长，照录如下：
      七月二十六日下午八点钟，农业
  局电话铃声惊动了坐在桌边的翟同
  志。
      “哪里？”翟同志习惯地拿起话
  筒问道：
      “我是防治血吸虫病办公室”对
  方很有力地回答着。“你们近来除四
  害搞得怎样？”
      “昨天，我们机关进行了一次大
  扫除，喷洒了滴滴涕和臭药水，杀死
  了不少苍蝇、蚊子和蝇蛆。”翟同志
  老实地汇报了近日的卫生工作情况。
      “啊，那你把数字报一下吧！”
  对方喜出望外地但也像命令似地说出
  了他摇电话的目的。
      “什么？要数字！”翟同志为难地
  抓起头皮来了。但只好向对方说明情
  况；“喂，打死的东西我们没有数也
  没有称，这怎么报呀！”
      “哎……你大致估一下吧，没有
  数字怎么行呢！”对方的口气好像有
  些缓和。
      “好吧！你记！苍蝇860个，蚊子
  450个，蝇蛆11两。”翟同志汇报完
  了。对方当然很乐意。可是在翟同志
  旁边听话的人，一个个捧腹大笑。
      翟同志放下话筒长叹了一口气，
  “我的天哪！这简直是逼人扯谎哪！”
    据青阳报编辑部说，在除四害的工作中，像上面这篇文章所谈到的数蚊子的争执时有发生。这篇文章正好表达了许多人的意见。不少农业合作社的社员就说过：“我有数蚊子的时间，还不如多睡会觉。”
    可是文章发表之后，也引起了不同的反应。有读者写信批评青阳报不该发表这篇文章。照这位读者看来，“为什么打死的东西当时不可以数一下或称一下呢？”“大致估计的数字当然是不够准确的。但是将估计的数字统计在全县除四害的总数字内，总比有数字不统计更为准确些。在这样情况下，请翟同志大致估计一下，又有什么不可以呢？”
    因此，这位读者认为：“如果翟同志自己没有掌握数字，只能说他工作责任心不强，怎能怪对方找你要数字不对呢？”
    青阳县防治血吸虫病办公室也写信给青阳报。他们承认要农业局随便估计数字是不对的，但是数字还是要统计的，不过他们今后将用发表填报的办法（五天填报一次）来代替打电话要数字。
    这就使青阳报感到为难了：对于打死的蚊子、苍蝇究竟要不要去数呢？“县卫生部门不统计数字吧，不符合上级要求；要统计吧，群众有意见。”他们在写给北京一家报纸的信中这样说，并且要求这家报纸帮助他们解决这个问题。
    这家报纸为了弄清领导机关是不是有这样的规定，以及领导机关对这事的看法，写了一封信给中央爱国卫生运动委员会。不久以前得到了复信。信中说：“中央爱国卫生运动委员会对打死后的苍蝇、蚊子未规定统计办法，究竟用什么办法统计尚正在研究中”。
    可以设想，如果把中央爱国卫生运动委员会的这个答复转告青阳县的同志们的话，这场数蚊子的争论仍然是不能结束的。因为这个答复并没有回答要不要数蚊子的问题，只不过说：“怎样统计法，我们还在研究。”
    数蚊子并不是什么新鲜事情，因为数蚊子、苍蝇、蛆虫、老鼠尾巴……而引起的纠纷也不是一起两起。可是数蚊子究竟有多大的好处？不数蚊子究竟有多大的坏处？是不是除非数蚊子就无法推动爱国卫生运动或者检查爱国卫生运动的成绩？对于这些问题，难道今天还不是做出明确结论的时候吗？
