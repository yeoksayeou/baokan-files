　　The Sound of Footsteps on the Stairs, and Then Someone Comes Down

　　The General Office of the Hubei Provincial People's Committee, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee, and the Zhejiang Grain System, and other state organs, have already begun to streamline their structures in a big way. The General Office of the Hubei Provincial People's Committee immediately displayed a new atmosphere after being streamlined. This is welcome good news. We hope that in this streamlining, we will no longer see the practice of "only hearing footsteps on the stairs, but not seeing anyone come down" that occurred in the past. The leaders of these organs are also shouting that the institutions are too large and the personnel are too numerous, but when it comes time to take action, they hesitate and retreat in the face of various concerns and difficulties. As a result, they shout in vain, the institutions remain large, and the personnel remain numerous. There were difficulties in streamlining in the past, and there will be difficulties in streamlining this year as well. Don't the Hubei and Shaanxi Provincial People's Committees have difficulties? We hope that comrades who encounter difficulties can learn from them.

### 楼梯一响，人就下来

　　楼梯一响，人就下来
    湖北省人民委员会办公厅、陕西省人民委员会、浙江省粮食系统等国家机关，已经在大刀阔斧地精简机构。湖北省人民委员会办公厅精简以后立即出现了新气象。这是值得欢迎的好消息。我们希望在这次精简中，不再看到过去那种“只听楼梯响，不见人下来”的作法。这些机关的领导人，嘴里也在喊着机构太大了，人员太多了，可是，一到需要行动的时候，他们就在各种顾虑和困难面前犹疑退缩了。结果是空喊一阵，机构照旧大，人员照旧多。过去精简有困难，今年精简同样也会有困难。难道湖北、陕西省人民委员会就没有困难吗？希望遇到困难的同志能向他们学习。
