Xinhua News Agency, December 9th: Enterprises under the First Ministry of Machine Building have reached the total output value level stipulated for 1957 in the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. According to recent statistics, the total output value of enterprises under this ministry reached 115.8% of the 1957 target by the end of October. Calculated based on the actual time of reaching the 1957 total output value level, the total output value plan stipulated in the Five-Year Plan was completed by the end of June this year, a year and a half ahead of schedule.

Of the twenty major products of enterprises under the First Ministry of Machine Building, sixteen have reached and exceeded the 1957 output targets stipulated in the Five-Year Plan, including metal-cutting machine tools, steam boilers, civilian ships, steam turbines, internal combustion engines, steelmaking equipment, and passenger cars. Four have not yet reached the 1957 output targets, including locomotives, petroleum industrial equipment, and sugar-making equipment.

Compared with the past few years, this year is a year of unprecedented high production for enterprises under the First Ministry of Machine Building. It is estimated that the total output value of this ministry this year will increase by 56% compared to 1955, and more than triple that of 1952. The output of various major products has increased significantly, with the output of metal-cutting machine tools increasing by more than 1.7 times compared to 1952.

From 1953 to the end of October this year, enterprises under this ministry have trial-produced more than a thousand important new products for various sectors of the national economy, including heavy-duty trucks, new-type locomotives, large and precision machine tools, medium-pressure boilers, and 6,000-kilowatt steam turbines. The trial production of these new products has greatly improved the technical level of China's machinery manufacturing industry.

In the past few years, the broad masses of workers in enterprises under the First Ministry of Machine Building have displayed a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity in production, while also implementing preliminary technical transformations of existing enterprises and building a number of new enterprises. Therefore, this ministry overfulfilled the worker labor productivity target stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan as early as March this year. It is estimated that the worker labor productivity of this ministry this year will increase by more than 100% compared to 1952.

　　我国机械工业技术水平大大提高
　　第一机械工业部所属企业三年半完成五年总产值计划
　　载重汽车新型机车大型机床等上千种新产品试制成功
    据新华社9日讯　第一机械工业部所属企业已经提前达到第一个五年计划规定1957年的总产值水平。据最近统计，这个部所属企业的总产值到10月底已达到1957年指标的115.8％，按实际达到1957年总产值水平的时间计算，提前一年半的时间在今年6月底完成了五年计划规定的总产值计划。
    第一机械工业部所属企业的二十种主要产品中，已经达到并且超过五年计划规定1957年产量指标的，有金属切削机床、蒸汽锅炉、民用船舶、蒸汽透平、内燃机、炼钢设备、客车等十六种；还没有达到1957年产量指标的，有机车、石油工业设备、制糖设备等四种。
    同过去几年比较，今年是第一机械工业部所属企业生产空前高涨的一年。预计这个部今年的生产总产值将比1955年增加56％，比1952年增加三倍多。各种主要产品的产量都大大增加，其中金属切削机床的产量将比1952年增加一点七倍以上。
    这个部所属企业从1953年到今年10月底止，已经为国民经济各部门试制成了一千多种重要的新产品，其中包括载重汽车、新型机车、大型和精密的机床、中压锅炉、六千瓩的汽轮机等。这些新产品的试制，大大提高了我国机械制造工业的技术水平。
    过去几年中，第一机械工业部所属企业中的广大职工，在生产中发挥了高度积极性和创造性，同时对原有企业实行了初步的技术改造，并且建成了一批新的企业，因此这个部早在今年3月就超额完成了第一个五年计划规定的工人劳动生产率指标，预计今年这个部的工人劳动生产率将比1952年提高100％以上。
