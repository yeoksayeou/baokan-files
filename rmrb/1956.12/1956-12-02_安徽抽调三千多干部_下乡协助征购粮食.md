　　Xinhua News Agency, Hefei Electric Dispatch: Various areas in Anhui Province are strengthening their leadership over grain procurement work.
　　Party and government leading organs at the prefectural and county levels throughout the province have transferred more than 3,800 cadres to go deep into districts and townships to assist in grain procurement work. Many regions have launched publicity campaigns in various ways to explain the significance of selling more surplus grain to farmers. The counties in the Anqing Prefecture universally convened cadre meetings with the participation of agricultural cooperative directors to study and arrange grain procurement work. After Tongcheng County held a cadre meeting, it purchased more than 5.9 million jin of grain on November 18 alone. Currently, the daily grain storage volume in various parts of Anhui Province has significantly increased compared to before. In early November, the average daily storage was only more than 40 million jin, but in mid-November, it increased to about 80 million jin, with a maximum of more than 90 million jin. As of the 22nd, the province had completed 69.66% of its grain procurement task.

　  安徽抽调三千多干部
　  下乡协助征购粮食
    据新华社合肥电　安徽省各地正在加强对粮食征购工作的领导。
    全省专区和县一级的党政领导机关已经抽调了三千八百多名干部深入区、乡协助做好粮食征购工作。很多地区都通过各种方式展开宣传，向农民说明多卖余粮的意义。安庆专区各县普遍召开了有农业社主任参加的干部会议，研究和布置粮食征购工作。桐城县召开干部会议以后，11月18日一天就收购了五百九十多万斤粮食。现在，安徽省各地每天粮食入库量比以前有显著增加。11月上旬平均每天入库只有四千多万斤，中旬增加到八千万斤左右，最高达到九千多万斤。到22日止，全省粮食征购任务已经完成69.66％。
