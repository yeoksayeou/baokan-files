    Thoughts Inspired by "Personnel Transfer"
    Ling Wei
    According to a report in the Heilongjiang Daily, the measure of the Heilongjiang Water Conservancy Department to extract 38% of its personnel to transfer them to the special districts and counties was taken when the department's tasks were about to increase. According to the department's calculations, the tasks can still be completed even with reduced personnel and increased tasks. This shows that before the streamlining, the department used more than just 38% of personnel. The report did not mention exactly how much more.
    This report reminded me of some of the situations I heard about during a visit to Henan in early November. Comrade Yang Jue, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Party Committee, cited an example in his report to the meeting of cadres above the county party committee secretary level, which was being held at the time. He said that the director of the Provincial Party Committee's Industry Department drafted a document, and after reviewing it within the department, they felt that the industrial issues should be handled by the Industrial Department of the Provincial People's Committee, so they sent it there. The comrades in the Industrial Department looked at it and felt that it was not appropriate to handle it alone, so they sent it to the Industrial Office, which specializes in industrial issues. The comrades in the Industrial Office looked at it and felt that it should go through the Provincial Party Committee, so they sent it to the Provincial Party Committee office. The Secretary-General of the Provincial Party Committee saw that it was an industrial issue and sent it back to the Director of the Industry Department of the Provincial Party Committee, the original drafter, to handle it.
    This example goes beyond the scope of one department. From this, we can see that not only are there too many people in one organization, but the organizations themselves are also too numerous. At least the necessity of organizations like the Industrial Office can be considered. Comrade Yang Jue's report cited the Kaifeng Special District Office as an example, saying that in addition to the formal establishment, this office also had 27 offices for production, disaster relief, mountain area planning, seeds, animal husbandry, desert investigation, technology promotion, Huai River management, water conservancy, flood control, water lifting tools, cadre review, counter-revolution suppression, cadre review for industry and handicrafts, counter-revolution suppression for industry and handicrafts, wage reform, wage investigation, conversion, immigration, elections, grain, coal, prices, transportation, oils, literacy, competitions, etc. One section even had five offices. The reporter believed that most of these offices could be abolished.
    The Henan Provincial Party Committee office issued 362 types of documents in August of this year, totaling 1.06 million words, averaging more than 34,000 words per day. This was a month with fewer documents issued. It is said that in normal months, the average is 40,000 to 60,000 words per day. How many people are needed to draft, revise, print, and distribute these documents! What happens after they are sent out? It is difficult to say without a comprehensive investigation. I only remember that Comrade Guo Xingsheng, Director of the Xinxiang Special District Commercial Bureau, said to me bluntly in a casual conversation, "There are too many documents, I can't finish reading them, I just look at the titles and file them." He said it very frankly, without any hesitation because a newspaper editor was present. It is conceivable that this practice is very common and not considered a major fault. I asked him how many documents he received each day. He said that the statistics for the second quarter of this year showed an average of 70 documents per day, which is a normal figure. Sometimes it is more than 80, and sometimes it is less than 60. Obviously, if the director had to read each of these documents word by word, the director would have to give up all other work and spend the whole day reading documents. Therefore, the method of "looking at the titles and filing them" has to be recognized as clever and correct.
    This kind of inexplicable and huge waste in issuing documents seems difficult to understand. However, when we consider it in conjunction with the many overlapping organizations and redundant personnel mentioned earlier, the problem becomes clear: if so many organizations and personnel do not issue documents, where can their revolutionary enthusiasm and political initiative be brought into play? But if they are often sent down to factories and villages, why not simply assign them to grassroots leadership positions? Cadres being transferred downward level by level can reduce bureaucracy in the upper-level organs and strengthen the leadership at the lower level, bringing the Party and the people closer together.
    If they are squeezed down layer by layer, what will happen to the original grassroots cadres (such as township cadres)? I think it is also very simple—most of them will return to production posts (of course, some people in the upper-level organs can also directly return to production posts). My hometown is a village of 172 households in Shanxi Province. The other day, someone came and said that the entire village has now formed an agricultural cooperative. Some of the cooperative cadres are completely detached from production and are paid according to the annual average or the highest number of workdays (such as the director, accountant, etc.); some are subsidized by the cooperative for part of their workdays (such as the production team leader, etc.). In total, more than 100 households are supporting five or six cooperative cadres (the number of cadres above the township level allocated to this village has not been calculated). If the work done by these cadres could be undertaken by more experienced "transferred" cadres, doing it even better, so that farmers can both increase production and reduce the burden, wouldn't that be better for our cause?
    "This will affect the morale of the cadres!"—Some comrades start from this consideration and conclude: "It is easy to make the determination, but difficult to handle." The so-called difficulty in handling means that our cadres are afraid of being transferred and afraid of participating in productive labor. I think this underestimates the level of awareness of our cadres. Countless hardships and self-sacrifices have been overcome in the past. As long as we conduct thorough mobilization and explain the reasons clearly, there is nothing that cannot be done. Even if there are really a few people who are too poorly aware and therefore become negative, we must see that the entire cause requires us to do this. If the difficulty arises from the disparity in living standards, then why can't we reduce the living standards of cadres to make them closer to the masses and consistent with the masses?

    从“人员下放”想到的
    凌微
    黑龙江水利厅抽出38％的人员下放到专区和县的措施，据黑龙江日报报道，是在水利厅任务即将加重的时候所采取的。而据该厅计算，在人员减少、任务加重的条件下，还是可以完成任务。这就说明在精简以前，该厅多用的人员并不只38％。究竟多用了多少，报道中没有提到。
    这个报道使我想起11月初在河南访问的时候听到的一些情况。河南省委书记处书记杨珏同志在他向当时正在召开的县委书记以上干部会议所做的报告中举例说，省委工业部长起草了一个文件，在部内看过以后，觉得工业方面的问题应该由省人民委员会的工业厅办理，就送过去了。工业厅的同志们看了，觉得自己也不好单独处理，又送给专门研究工业问题的工业办公室。工业办公室的同志们看了，觉得应该经过省委，又送到省委机关。省委秘书长一看是工业方面的问题，又批到省委工业部长即原起草人那里去处理。
    这个例子超出了一个厅的范围。从这里可以看到：不仅是一个机构中人太多了，而且机构本身也太多了。至少像工业办公室这样的机构是可以考虑要不要的。杨珏同志的报告以开封专署为例说，这个专署除正式编制外，还有生产、救灾、山区规划、种子、畜牧、沙荒调查、技术推广、治淮、水利、防汛、提水工具、审干、肃反、工业手工业审干、工业手工业肃反、工资改革、工资调查、转建、移民、选举、粮食、煤炭、物价、运输、油脂、扫盲、竞赛等二十七个办公室，有一个科竟有五个办公室。报告人认为，这些办公室大部分可以撤销。
    河南省委机关今年8月份一个月发出文件三百六十二种，一百零六万字，每天平均三万四千多字。这是发文件较少的月份。据说平常月份一天平均四万到六万多字。这些文件需要多少人来起草、修改、印刷和发行啊！发出去以后怎样呢？没有全面调查，很难说。我只记得新乡专署商业局长郭兴盛同志在闲谈中直截了当地对我说：“文件太多了，看不完，看看标题就归了档。”他说得很坦然，并不因报纸编辑在座而有所避讳。可想这种作法很一般，不算什么大的过错。我问他每天来多少文件，他说今年第二季度的统计是一天平均收七十件，这是平常数字。多时八十件以上，少时也有六十件。很明显，这样多的文件如果都要局长逐字逐句地看，局长就只有放弃一切工作，整天专看文件。所以，“看看标题就归档”的办法，不得不被承认为聪明的和正确的。
    发文件方面的这种平白无故的巨大浪费，似乎很难理解。但是同前面所说的那么多的重叠机构和多余人员联系起来一想，问题也很明白：那么多的机构和人员如果不发文件，他们的革命热情和政治积极性往哪里发挥使用呢？可是如果让他们经常下厂下乡，那又何不把他们干脆配备到下层领导岗位？干部逐级下放，一方面可以减少文牍、克服上层机关的官僚主义，一方面可以加强下层的领导，使党和人民的关系密切起来。
    一层层挤下去，基层的原有干部（比如乡干部）怎么办呢？我看也很简单——大部分人都回生产岗位（当然上层机关也有一部分人可以直接回到生产岗位）。我的故乡是山西省一个一百七十二户人家的村庄。前几天来人说，现在全村组成一个农业合作社，社干部有的完全脱离生产，按全年中等的或最多的劳动日（如社长、会计等）计算；有的由社补贴一部分劳动日（如生产队长等）。折合起来，一百多户人家养了五、六个社干部（乡以上的干部摊到这村该有多少，没有计算）。这些干部所做的工作如果能由更有经验的“下放”干部来担负，做得更好一点，使农民一能增产，二能减轻负担，这对我们的事业不是更好一些么？
    “这会影响干部情绪的啊！”——有些同志从这种考虑出发，得出结论说：“决心好下，处理困难。”所谓处理困难，意思是说我们的干部怕下放，怕参加生产劳动。我觉得这是低估了我们的干部的觉悟程度。过去无数的艰难困苦和自我牺牲，只要深入动员，讲清道理，没有办不通的。即使真有少数人觉悟太低，因此消极下去，也必须看到整个事业是需要我们这样作的。如果困难是发生于生活水平悬殊，那为什么不可以把干部的生活待遇降低一些，使它接近群众，同群众一致呢？
