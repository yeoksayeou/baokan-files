    The Hami-Urumqi and Urumqi-Alashankou dispatch teams of the First Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways saved more than 15.4 million yuan in railway construction and operating costs during the survey and design of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway's Xinjiang section. They selected an economical and reasonable route of 1,052 kilometers.
    The comrades of these two dispatch teams did more running, asking, researching, and comparing plans in their surveying and design work. When making traction calculations and economic comparisons, they corrected the previous one-sided approach of only reducing engineering construction costs and neglecting operating costs. They focused on eliminating reverse slopes and reducing earthwork. As a result, the route surveyed and determined by the Urumqi-Alashankou team was 23 kilometers shorter than the route in the design instructions approved by the leading organization, saving 8.05 million yuan in engineering costs alone. They also promoted many advanced experiences, which increased labor productivity and reduced more than 6,600 workdays, worth more than 130,000 yuan.
    Over the past year, Soviet experts have made a total of 160 suggestions for this line: 147 of them have been adopted. Because of the adoption of Soviet experts' suggestions, the engineering cost and operating expenses of the Dabancheng Tianshan mountain area route can be reduced by more than 7.2 million yuan.

    认真勘测　反复比较
    本报讯　铁道部第一设计院哈密—乌鲁木齐和乌鲁木齐—阿拉山口两个派遣总队，在兰新铁路新疆境内线路的勘测设计中，节省了铁路工程建筑费和营运费一千五百四十多万元，选择了一条长一千零五十二公里的经济合理的线路。
    这两个派遣总队的同志，在勘测和设计工作中，做到了多跑、多问、多研究、多作比较方案。在作牵引计算，经济比较时，纠正了过去只管减少工程建筑费，忽视节约营运费的片面作法，并重点的取消了逆坡、减少土石方，结果乌阿总队定测的线路，比领导机关批准的设计意见书中的线路，缩短了二十三公里，仅工程费一项就节约了八百零五万元。他们还推广了许多先进经验，使劳动生产率提高了，减少了六千六百多个工天，价值人民币十三万多元。
    在这条线路上，苏联专家一年来共提出了一百六十项建议：已经采用了一百四十七项，达板城天山山区路线工程，因采用苏联专家建议，可减少工程费和营运费七百二十多万元。　（新疆日报）
