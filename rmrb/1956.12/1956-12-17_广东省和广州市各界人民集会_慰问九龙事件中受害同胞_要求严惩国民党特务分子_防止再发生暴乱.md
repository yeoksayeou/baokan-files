Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 16th (Xinhua Reporter Fang Li): Over four thousand people from all walks of life in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City gathered solemnly at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall today to express their condolences to compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon affected by the Kowloon riot incident. Workers injured by secret agents in the Kowloon riots who are receiving medical treatment in Guangzhou, some family members of victims, and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots who have returned to Guangzhou for visits also attended today's meeting.

Today, the walls of the corridors on both sides of the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall were lined with many photos of the Kowloon riot incident and the blood-stained clothes of the victims; the photos included portraits of worker compatriots murdered by secret agents, evidence of arson and murder by secret agents, and the remains of factories or schools burned and destroyed by secret agents. In the center of the hall of the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, a huge banner was hung, which read: "We demand that the British authorities in Hong Kong severely punish the Kuomintang secret agents who created the Kowloon riots!" People know that although the British authorities in Hong Kong have punished some of those who participated in the riots after the Kowloon riot incident, they have not yet seen them punish a single mastermind.

Zhang Boquan, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, first addressed the meeting, expressing, on behalf of the people of all walks of life in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, the most cordial condolences to the compatriots who were affected by the Kowloon riot incident and their families. He said: "Chinese people living in Hong Kong are all our compatriots, and we cannot but care about them at all times. Therefore, we have every reason to ask the British authorities in Hong Kong to assume the following responsibilities: First, to investigate the murderers and severely punish the Kuomintang secret agent rioters who committed murder and arson. Second, to take effective measures in the future to prevent Kuomintang secret agents from creating riots again and to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the Chinese people living in Hong Kong."

Wu Shaoquan, a worker at the Tsuen Wan Workers Service Department of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile Dyeing Industry Workers Union and a worker at the South China Yarn Factory, Lu Mi and Gu Huizhen, staff members of the Tsuen Wan Workers Clinic of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, and Feng Hui, a worker at Heung To Middle School, successively denounced the bloody atrocities of the Kuomintang secret agents in the Kowloon riot incident at the meeting. They are witnesses and victims of the secret agents' heinous crimes. Lu Mi still carried many scars on her body when she spoke on stage today. In front of more than four thousand relatives from the motherland, Wu Shaoquan angrily denounced the secret agents' "bloodbath of Tsuen Wan." He and Lu Mi used what they heard, saw, and experienced to testify to the bestial behavior of Kuomintang secret agents in the riots, including murder, arson, robbery, and even rape of women on the street. Gu Huizhen testified at the meeting that Kuomintang secret agents had raped her in batches and in shifts like beasts. People remember that when Hong Kong Governor Sir Alexander Grantham was asked about the rape incidents reported in the local newspapers at a press conference held on October 16, one of his assistants, Hong Kong Chief Secretary David, stammered and said: "The government has no first-hand evidence to support such reports." Today, Gu Huizhen, one of the victims of the rape atrocities, personally made a tearful accusation at this meeting.

Zhang Huan, the mother of Yang Guanfu, a pharmacist at the Tsuen Wan Workers Clinic of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions who was murdered, also spoke at the meeting. Zhang Huan was in tears when she spoke. She demanded that the British authorities in Hong Kong severely punish the secret agent perpetrators who caused the incident.

The democratic parties and people's organizations in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Xi'an, Changchun, Wuhan and other cities today sent telegrams to the conference to express their condolences to the affected compatriots, and demanded that the British authorities in Hong Kong severely punish the murderers and ensure that no more atrocities would be repeated in the future.

Lin Qiangyun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, finally spoke on behalf of the presidium of today's meeting. He said: "We have just heard the tearful accusations of the compatriots and family members of the victims in the Kowloon riots, which cannot but make us feel extremely bitter and hateful. Here, I once again express, on behalf of the people of all walks of life in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, the most cordial condolences to our compatriots who were affected by the Kowloon riots. At the same time, we express our highest respect to the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, especially the working class in Hong Kong and Kowloon, who bravely fought against the Kuomintang secret agents in the riots in order to protect their own lives and the safety of factories and enterprises!" He also expressed, on behalf of the people of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, their heartfelt wishes that the affected compatriots and workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon would recover their health as soon as possible and return to work.

    广东省和广州市各界人民集会
    慰问九龙事件中受害同胞
    要求严惩国民党特务分子　防止再发生暴乱
    新华社广州16日电　新华社记者方力报道：广东省和广州市各界人民四千多人今天在中山纪念堂隆重集会，慰问在九龙暴乱事件中受害的港九同胞。正在广州市就医的在九龙暴乱中被特务分子毒打受伤的工人，一部分受害者的家属和回到广州参观的港澳同胞，也出席了今天的大会。
    中山纪念堂两侧走廊的墙壁上，今天陈列着许多九龙暴乱事件的照片和受害者的血衣；照片中有被特务分子杀害的工人同胞的遗像，有特务分子纵火、杀人的罪证，还有被特务分子焚烧、破坏的工厂或学校的遗迹。在中山纪念堂大厅的中间，悬挂着一幅巨大的标语，上面写着“我们要求香港英国当局严惩制造九龙暴乱的国民党特务分子！”人们知道，九龙暴乱事件后，香港英国当局虽然惩办了一些参加暴乱的人，但还没有看到他惩办过一个元凶祸首。
    政协广东省委员会副主席张?村首先在大会上致词，他代表广东省和广州市各界人民向在九龙暴乱事件中受害的同胞和他们的家属，表示最亲切的慰问。他说：“居住在香港的中国人，都是我国的同胞，我们不能不时刻关怀他们。因此，我们完全有理由要求香港英国当局负起如下的责任：第一、要追究凶手，严正的惩治那些杀人放火的国民党特务暴徒。第二、今后要采取有效措施，防止国民党特务分子再制造暴乱，确保住在香港的中国人民的生命和财产的安全。”
    港九纺织染业职工总会荃湾工友服务部工作人员、南海纱厂工人吴绍全，港九工会联合会荃湾工人医疗所工作人员吕米、古惠贞，香岛中学工友冯辉先后在会上控诉了九龙暴乱事件中国民党特务分子的血腥暴行。他们是特务分子滔天罪行的见证人和受害者。吕米在今天登台讲话的时候身上还带着累累伤痕。吴绍全在四千多祖国亲人的面前，激愤地控诉了特务分子“血洗荃湾”的经过。他和吕米两人以他们耳闻、眼见和身受的事实，指证出国民党特务分子在暴乱中杀人、纵火、劫掠以至当街强奸妇女的禽兽行为。古惠贞在会上指证说：国民党特务分子曾经像野兽一样，分批轮流强奸了她。人们记得，香港英国总督葛量洪在10月16日举行的记者招待会上被人问到本地报纸曾经报道的暴徒强奸事件的时候，在座的一位他的助手、香港辅政司戴维曾经支吾其词的说：“政府没有任何第一手的证据支持这种报道”。今天，强奸暴行的受害人之一古惠贞在这个大会上亲自提出了血泪的控诉。
    在会上讲话的还有港九工会联合会荃湾工人医疗所被杀害的配药师杨观福的母亲张焕等。张焕讲话的时候泣不成声。她要求香港英国当局严惩肇事的特务祸首。
    北京、上海、天津、西安、长春、武汉等城市的各民主党派、各人民团体，今天分别打电报给大会对受害同胞表示慰问，并且要求香港英国当局严正的惩办凶手，保证今后不再有暴行重演。
    广东省工会联合会主席林锵云最后代表今天大会的主席团讲话。他说：“我们刚才听了在九龙暴乱中受害同胞和受害同胞家属的血泪控诉，使我们不能不感到万分的切齿痛恨。在这里我再一次代表广东省和广州市各界人民，向在九龙暴乱中受害的我国同胞致以最亲切的慰问。同时，我们对在暴乱中为了保卫自己和工厂企业的生命和财产安全而同国民党特务分子进行了英勇斗争的港九爱国同胞，特别是港九的工人阶级，表示最崇高的敬意！”他并且代表广东省和广州市人民衷心地祝受害的港九同胞和工友早日恢复健康，重新走上工作岗位。
