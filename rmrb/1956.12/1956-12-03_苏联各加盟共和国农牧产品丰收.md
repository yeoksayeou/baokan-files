Moscow Dispatch from our newspaper, December 2nd: The cotton harvests in the Soviet republics of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan have been excellent this year, all having completed their raw cotton procurement plans ahead of schedule.

　　Uzbekistan
    In the cotton fields of Uzbekistan, a major cotton-producing region in the Soviet Union, where cotton bolls are abundant, cotton-picking machines are working diligently. One cotton-picking machine replaces the labor of sixty to eighty people. In areas inaccessible to machines, people are diligently picking by hand. The cotton harvest is nearing completion. The cotton harvests in the nine provinces of the Uzbek Republic and the Kara-Kalpak Autonomous Republic are much better than in previous years. In the Denausk district, over 17,000 hectares of cotton fields yielded 35 quintals of raw cotton per hectare. In the Ordzhonikidze district, cotton fields yielded 38 quintals per hectare. Cotton has also been harvested from cotton fields on reclaimed land in the "wilderness." The entire Uzbekistan has delivered 2.8 million tons of cotton to the state, 500,000 tons more than at this time last year.
　　Kyrgyzstan
    The Kyrgyz Republic has delivered a total of 145,000 tons of raw cotton. The average yield per hectare is 20 quintals, which is 29,000 tons more than at this time last year. 85% of the delivered cotton is first and second grade. The Tola-Wawan district of the republic has the best harvest, where collective farms can yield an average of 30 quintals of cotton per hectare.
　　Kazakhstan
    The Kazakh Republic has delivered a total of 191,000 tons of raw cotton to the state, which is 64,000 tons more than at this time last year, of which 88% is first-grade cotton. The average yield per hectare is 6 quintals more than last year. South Kazakhstan Province has seen the largest increase in cotton production. In particular, the Ilichivsk district delivered 64,400 tons, exceeding the original plan by 10,200 tons. The 22,300 hectares of cotton planted in this district yielded an average of 29 quintals per hectare.
　　Ukraine
    The Ukrainian Republic has also completed its plan to increase the production of livestock products. During this economic year, the collective farms of the republic have overfulfilled the milk production plan. The total milk production of collective farms is 4,782,000 tons, an increase of half compared to last year. The substantial increase in milk has enabled the republic to complete its procurement and acquisition plan for milk four months ahead of schedule. A total of 3.98 million tons of milk have been sold, which is 1.1 million tons more than last year. The average milk yield per dairy cow is 1,967 kilograms, an increase of 500 kilograms per head compared to last year.

    Meat production has also increased significantly.

　　苏联各加盟共和国农牧产品丰收
    本报莫斯科2日电　苏联乌兹别克、吉尔吉斯和哈萨克三个共和国今年棉花收成都很好，都提前完成了原棉采购计划。
　　乌兹别克
    在苏联主要产棉区乌兹别克斯坦棉桃累累的棉田上，摘棉机紧张地工作着。一台摘棉机代替六十到八十人的劳动。在机器活动不到的地方，人们辛勤地用手收摘。收棉工作将近完成。乌兹别克共和国的九个州和卡拉·卡尔巴克自治共和国的棉花收成，比前几年好得多。德纳乌区有一万七千多公顷棉田每公顷收了三十五公担原棉。奥尔忠尼启则区棉田每公顷收了三十八公担。在“荒原”的已被开发土地上的棉田也收下了棉花。整个乌兹别克斯坦已交给国家二百八十万吨棉花，比去年此时多交了五十万吨。
　　吉尔吉斯
    吉尔吉斯共和国一共交了十四万五千吨原棉。每公顷平均收二十公担，比去年这个时候多交两万九千吨。所交棉花85％都是头等和二等棉。共和国的陀拉宛区收成最好，这里的集体农庄平均每公顷都能收三十公担棉花。
　　哈萨克
    哈萨克共和国一共交给国家十九万一千吨原棉，比去年这个时候多交六万四千吨，其中88％都是头等棉，平均每公顷比去年多交六公担。南哈萨克斯坦州棉花增产最多。特别是伊利奇夫斯克区，共交了六万四千四百吨，比原计划超过一万零二百吨，这个区播种的二万二千三百公顷棉花，平均每公顷收二十九公担。
　　乌克兰
    乌克兰共和国也完成了畜牧产品的增产计划。在这一经济年度中共和国的集体农庄超额完成了牛奶生产计划，集体农庄牛奶总产量是四百七十八万二千吨，比去年增加了半倍。牛奶的大量增加，使共和国提前四个月完成采购和收购牛奶计划。一共交售了牛奶三百九十八万吨，比去年多交一百一十万吨。平均每头奶牛的挤奶量是一千九百六十七公斤。比去年每头增加了五百公斤。
    肉类产量也有很大增加。
