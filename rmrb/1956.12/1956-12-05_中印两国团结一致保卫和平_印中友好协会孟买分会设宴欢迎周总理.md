Xinhua News Agency, Bombay, December 4th: The India-China Friendship Association Bombay Branch held a banquet on the evening of December 3rd at Bombay's largest stadium, the Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium, to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their delegation.

Bombay State Acting Governor M. K. Chagla said in his speech at the banquet: "How can any organization be considered an international organization or a United Nations organization if it does not have the representation of a large country like China?"

He said that the so-called representative of China currently in the United Nations "is maintaining its own 'remnants of opposition' with the help of external institutions." He stated that on this issue, "we Indians feel as strongly as the Chinese people," because the two countries are linked by close friendly relations.

Chagla said that the strengthening of the friendship between the two countries that announced the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence to the world is "a very important event in international politics."

He continued: "The sudden and unwarranted aggression against Egypt has made the whole world realize that humanity is on the edge of a terrible cliff, ready to slip down and be destroyed at any moment. Therefore, the eyes of the world are watching the Premiers and peoples of our two countries."

He said, therefore, "If we stand firmly united, solemnly determined to bring peace to the world, we can make aggression impossible in the future, and we can abolish the use of violence as a means of solving international problems." He emphasized that this friendship will certainly help Asia and Africa to get rid of the shackles of colonialism, "and if Asia and Africa are liberated and united in friendship, world peace will be guaranteed."

In his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the India-China Friendship Association for its continuous efforts in promoting friendship between the two countries. He spoke of India's efforts to restore China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, efforts that are supported by people all over the world. He said, "Depriving China of its legitimate seat in the United Nations will first and foremost harm the United Nations itself." He also believed that India's just position on this issue will eventually prevail.

Zhou Enlai pointed out that although contacts between China and India have greatly developed, they are still far from sufficient, and there is still "much work waiting for us to do" in exchanging each other's experiences. He particularly emphasized the need to "learn each other's languages" in carrying out cultural exchanges for closer mutual understanding and in completing common tasks. He hoped that more Chinese students would be sent to India to study Hindi and other Indian languages.

President of the India-China Friendship Association Bombay Branch, R.K. Karanjia, welcomed the Chinese guests.

Beautifully carved plates and oil paintings were presented as souvenirs to the Chinese guests. Premier Zhou Enlai also presented the India-China Friendship Association Bombay Branch with some gifts.

People presented fragrant bouquets to the Chinese guests. Premier Zhou and others then went to each table to pay their respects to the Indian friends. The banquet ended after a short entertainment program. It was already late at night, but enthusiastic Indians were still waiting by the roadside, cheering as the vehicles carrying the Chinese guests drove past.

　  印中友好协会孟买分会设宴欢迎周总理
    新华社孟买4日电　印中友好协会孟买分会3日晚上在孟买最大的运动场——瓦拉巴伊帕特尔运动场举行宴会，欢迎周恩来总理和贺龙副总理等一行。
    孟买邦代理邦长穆·库·查格拉在宴会上讲话的时候说：“任何一个组织，如果没有像中国这样一个大国的代表参加的话，它怎么能被认为是一个国际组织或者联合国组织呢？”
    他说，目前在联合国中的所谓中国代表“是借助外界机构”来维持它自己的“反对派残余”。他表示，在这个问题上，“我们印度人像中国人民一样抱有强烈的感觉”，因为两国是由密切的友好关系联结在一起的。
    查格拉说，向全世界宣布了关于和平共处的五项原则的两个国家之间的友谊的加强是“国际政治中的一件非常重要的事件”。
    他继续说：“对埃及突然发动的无端侵略使全世界认识到：人类正处在可怕的悬崖的边缘上，它随时都可能滑下去而遭到毁灭。所以，世界上的眼光都在注视着我们两国的总理和人民。”
    他说，因此，“如果我们牢固地团结在一起，庄严地决心使世界得到和平，我们就能使侵略在未来不可能发生，我们就能废除以暴力作为解决国际问题的方法”。他强调说，这种友谊一定能够帮助亚洲和非洲摆脱殖民主义的枷锁，“如果亚洲和非洲获得自由，而且友好地团结起来，世界和平就有了保证”。
    周恩来总理在他的讲话中对印中友好协会在促进两国间的友谊方面所不断进行的努力，表示衷心的感谢。他谈到了印度在恢复中国在联合国组织中的合法地位方面所作的努力，这种努力得到全世界人民的支持。他说，“联合国剥夺中国的合法地位将首先使联合国自己受到损害”。他并且相信，印度在这个问题上的公正的观点最后会取得胜利。
    周恩来指出，虽然中印两国之间的接触已经大大地发展了，但仍然是很不够的，在交流彼此的经验方面还有着“许多工作等待我们去作”。他特别强调在为了更亲密的互相了解而进行文化交流方面，在完成共同的任务方面，“需要学习彼此的语言”。他希望有更多的中国学生被送到印度来学习印地文和其他印度语言。
    印中友好协会孟买分会主席鲁·克·卡朗吉亚对中国客人表示欢迎。
    雕刻得很好看的盘子和油画作为纪念品赠给了中国贵宾。周恩来总理也赠给印中友好协会孟买分会一些礼物。
    人们把芬芳的花束献给中国客人。周总理等以后挨次走向每一个桌子向印度朋友互致敬意。宴会在表演了简短的娱乐节目后结束。这时已经是深夜了，但是热情的印度人还在路旁等候着，当中国客人的车辆开过去的时候向他们欢呼。
