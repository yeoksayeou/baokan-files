Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, December 14th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Mongolian People's Republic has issued a statement strongly protesting the unjust decision made by the United Nations Security Council regarding the admission of the Mongolian People's Republic as a member of the United Nations.

The statement said that the results of the Security Council's vote on December 12 regarding the admission of the Mongolian People's Republic as a member of the United Nations proved that the majority of Council members disregarded the legitimate right of the Mongolian People's Republic to become a member of the United Nations and disregarded the provisions of the United Nations Charter that clearly define membership eligibility.

The statement specifically pointed out that what aroused the indignation of the Mongolian public was the actions of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which used a veto power that it was not legally entitled to, and once again acted as a docile tool of the enemies of peace and international cooperation, undermining the satisfactory resolution of this issue.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Mongolian People's Republic stated that the fact that the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek clique remain in the United Nations under the patronage of certain countries and certain figures will only harm the cause of the United Nations, thereby undermining its prestige in the eyes of the world public.

Mongolian Foreign Minister A. Ajilbich has already submitted the aforementioned statement to the President of the United Nations Security Council, Béland, and the United Nations Secretary-General, Hammarskjöld, on December 13, and requested that this statement be distributed to all members of the Security Council.

    蒙古外交部长发表声明
    抗议安理会阻拒蒙古进联合国
    新华社乌兰巴托14日电　蒙古人民共和国外交部发表声明，坚决抗议联合国安全理事会在接纳蒙古人民共和国为联合国会员国问题上所作出的不公正的决定。
    声明说，安全理事会12月12日就接纳蒙古人民共和国为联合国会员国问题表决的结果证明，多数理事国无视蒙古人民共和国成为联合国会员国的合法权利，无视联合国宪章明确决定的会员资格的条文。
    声明特别指出，引起蒙古公众愤慨的是蒋介石分子的行动，他使用了依法不归他所有的否决权，再一次充当了和平和国际合作的敌人的顺从工具，破坏了这一项问题的圆满解决。
    蒙古人民共和国外交部声明，蒋介石集团的代表在某些国家、某些人物的庇护下留在联合国，这只会危害联合国的事业，从而破坏它在全世界公众面前的威信。
    蒙古外交部长阿吉尔毕希已经在13日把上述声明交给联合国安全理事会主席贝朗德和联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，并且请求把这个声明散发给安全理事会各理事国。
