    Rapidly Change the Phenomenon of Relaxing Winter Production
　　Henan Provincial Party Committee Holds Meeting to Study and Comprehensively Arrange Mass Production
　　Wenzhou Prefecture, Zhejiang, Sends Large Numbers of Cadres to the Countryside to Promote Winter Planting
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Zhengzhou) Henan Province suffered extensive disasters this year. Because various localities were busy with disaster relief, unified purchase and sale of grain, and other tasks, production work was relaxed. As of mid-November, due to drought and lack of moisture, only 80% of wheat had been planted. The tens of millions of mu of wheat fields that had already sprouted were also threatened by drought. Hundreds of thousands of water wells in the province have not been fully utilized, and hundreds of thousands of waterwheels are also waiting to be used. In terms of sideline occupations, although rural areas have put out a large amount of manpower and resources to engage in sideline production, some agricultural cooperatives have not well integrated agriculture and sideline occupations. Many farmers are still not clear about the principles and practices of developing sideline occupations. Some members are not very motivated to produce because they do not understand the grain policy well enough.
    The Henan Provincial Party Committee studied these issues at an enlarged meeting held on November 27. The meeting required all localities to do a good job in the unified purchase and sale of grain on the basis of comprehensively arranging mass production and life; solve the outstanding issues in the distribution of income in agricultural cooperatives, and further tap the potential of sideline occupations.
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) Wenzhou Prefecture in southern Zhejiang, where the agricultural season starts earliest, has basically finished harvesting late rice, and autumn miscellaneous grains such as sweet potatoes and corn are also being harvested. However, the progress of winter planting is slow, and farmers are not very enthusiastic about production.
    In previous years, wheat seedlings could already be seen at this time, but this year, wheat has not yet been sown in many places. The sown area of green manure crops—grass seeds—has not reached the sowing area of last year, and a large amount of grass seeds in the region have not been sown; although the purchase price of rapeseed has increased by 36% this year, the rapeseed expansion plan in the region has only completed about half, and most counties have not completed the plan; winter manure accumulation has not been carried out well enough, and the amount of grass cutting for ash and manure accumulation in pig and cattle pens has decreased compared with last year. The preparations for large-scale winter afforestation and cultivation of tea, mulberry, citrus and other special products have not been fully done.
    The objective reason for the slow progress of winter planting is that the entire region has been affected by drought this year, and the maturity period of late rice has been delayed. However, in some areas, agricultural cooperatives did not firmly grasp the principle of taking production as the center in the autumn harvest distribution and the implementation of grain requisition, purchase, and sales, and relaxed their leadership over winter planting production. Some agricultural cooperatives in disaster areas and non-disaster areas emphasized production for disaster relief and diversified operations, and only attached importance to certain sideline productions that could quickly generate profits, neglecting agricultural production that is related to the lives of the majority of members in the coming year. For example, in a cooperative in Huanggang Township, Yueqing County, there were one hundred and ninety laborers, and more than one hundred and thirty people went out to do small business or engage in other sideline production a few days ago; in Qidu Township, Yongjia County, five or six hundred members went to Wenzhou City every day to do short-term work, which seriously affected the current winter planting production. In the work of expanding rapeseed planting, many cadres believed that raising the purchase price of rapeseed would solve all problems, thus abandoning the necessary and in-depth publicity of rapeseed planting.
    Wenzhou Prefecture's winter planting plan this year requires reaching 72% of the total cultivated land area, an expansion of 20% compared to last year, and should also include greening and afforestation. The task is very heavy. Now the sowing season for many winter crops is about to pass, and the production task is very heavy and urgent.
    For this reason, the Wenzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China issued an emergency instruction, requiring all counties to immediately take various effective measures, go deep into the grassroots, and actively lead winter planting production. A large number of leading cadres from the prefectural committee and the special commissioner's office have led cadres drawn from various departments to go deep into eight counties including Wenling, Yueqing, and Jingning to inspect and help the counties do a good job in the autumn harvest distribution and grain requisition and sales work with production as the center, and strive to complete the winter planting plan, so as to lay the foundation for increased agricultural production next year.

    迅速改变放松冬季生产的现象
　　河南省委开会研究全面安排群众生产
　　浙江温州专区派出大批干部下乡推动冬种工作
    本报郑州电　河南省今年遭灾面积很大，由于各地忙于救灾和粮食统购统销和其他一些工作，就把生产工作放松了。截至11月中旬，全省由于天旱无墒，只种了80％的小麦，已生长出嫩苗的数千万亩麦田，又在受到干旱的威胁。全省几十万眼水井没有充分利用，十几万部水车也在等待着使用。在副业方面，农村中虽然拿出了大批的人力和物力去搞副业生产，但是因为有些农业社没有把农业和副业很好地结合起来，很多农民对于发展副业的方针和作法，还不大清楚。有些社员因为对粮食政策不够了解，生产积极性不高。
    河南省委会在11月27日召开的扩大会议上，研究了这些问题。会议要求各地在全面安排群众生产和生活的基础上，做好粮食统购统销工作；解决农业社收益分配中的遗留问题，进一步挖副业潜力。
    本报讯　浙江南部农事季节最早的温州专区，晚稻收割已经基本结束，蕃薯、玉米等秋杂粮也正在收获，但是冬种工作进度迟缓，农民生产劲头不大。
    往年这时候已经能看到麦苗，而今年不少地方小麦还没有下种；播种的绿肥作物——草籽，没有达到去年的播种面积，全区还有大量草籽没有种下去；虽然今年菜籽收购价格提高了36％，但全区油菜扩种计划只完成一半左右，大部分县都没有完成计划；冬季积肥也进行得不够好，割草烧灰和猪牛栏的积肥都比去年减少了。大规模的冬季造林和栽培茶、桑、柑桔等特产作物的准备工作，也没有充分做好。
    冬种工作进行迟缓的客观原因，是今年全区受旱，晚稻成熟期推迟了。但是，部分地区却是农业社在秋收分配和贯彻粮食征、购、销的工作中没有紧紧掌握以生产为中心的方针，放松了对冬种生产的领导。灾区和非灾区一些农业社强调生产救灾和多种经营，便只重视某些能很快获利的副业生产，忽视关系到广大社员明年生活的农业生产。如乐清县黄岗乡的一个社，有一百九十个劳动力，前些日子有一百三十多人出门去做小生意或经营其他副业生产；永嘉县七都乡每天有五、六百个社员到温州市去做短工，这些都严重影响了当前冬种生产。在扩种油菜的工作中，不少干部认为提高了菜籽的收购价格就万事大吉了，因而放弃了必要的，深入的宣传播种油菜的工作。
    温州专区今年冬种计划，要求达到耕地总面积的72％，比去年扩大了20％，还应加上绿化造林，任务很大，现在许多冬播作物的播种季节即将过去，生产任务十分繁重而紧迫。
    为此，中共温州地委发出了紧急指示，要求各县立即采取各种有效措施，深入下去，积极领导冬种生产。地委和专署机关的大批领导干部，已经带领了从各部门抽调的干部深入到温岭、乐清、景宁等八个县去检查和帮助各县搞好以生产为中心的秋收分配和粮食征购销工作，争取完成冬种计划，为明年农业增产打下基础。　（春天）
