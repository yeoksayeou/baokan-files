Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 21st. Tan Yunshan, Dean of the Chinese Academy of India International University, reported to the overseas Chinese in Calcutta on the afternoon of the 17th his impressions of returning to China for sightseeing and the important significance of the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

At a grand tea party held by the overseas Chinese, he sincerely hoped that the compatriots in India would unite, and he also asked the Kuomintang members in India to abandon their prejudices in good conscience and unite under the banner of patriotism.

Tan Yunshan said that today's motherland is unprecedentedly united, and the people of the whole country are wholeheartedly trying to build China into a prosperous and happy country. He said with emotion that Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said that our country is backward and must "catch up" with European and American countries. It has been decades since Mr. Sun said this, but the old government has not done so, and the new government has already begun to do so.

Tan Yunshan met with Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai in Beijing. He told the overseas Chinese that the government leaders were very humble and asked and listened sincerely to all kinds of things. He also conveyed the greetings of He Xiangning, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, to the overseas Chinese in India.

    谭云山回到印度
    愿华侨搞好团结
    据新华社新德里21日电  印度国际大学中国学院院长谭云山17日下午在加尔各答向华侨们报告了他回国观光的感想及和平解放台湾的重要意义。
    他在华侨举行的一个盛大茶会上诚恳地希望在印度的侨胞搞好团结，并且要求在印度的国民党员，本着良心抛开成见，团结到爱国的旗帜下来。
    谭云山说，今天的祖国空前的团结，全国人民一心一意要把中国建设成富强康乐的国家。他感慨地说，孙中山先生曾说过，我们的国家是落后的，必须要“迎头赶上”欧美国家。孙先生的话说了以后已经有几十年了，旧政府一直都没有照着做，现在的新政府已经开始做了。
    谭云山在北京曾会见毛泽东主席和周恩来总理。他告诉侨胞说，政府首长非常谦虚，对各种事物都是虚心的问，诚恳的听。他还转致了华侨事务委员会主任何香凝向在印度的侨胞的问候。
