    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 25th: News from Tokyo: The newly formed Ishibashi Cabinet, at its first meeting held this afternoon, discussed the new cabinet's diplomatic policy towards China.
    The meeting decided that trade with China should be promoted in the future. Therefore, efforts should be made to ease the restrictions imposed by the Paris Coordinating Committee on China, especially to flexibly apply the special approval system.
    The cabinet meeting also decided that regarding the issues of recognizing China and restoring diplomatic relations with China, opinions should be coordinated with the United Nations and the "free world" group before further research. Japan will not take the lead alone.
    Regarding the issue of promoting Sino-Japanese trade, the cabinet meeting decided that consultations should be held with the United States and other "free countries" as soon as possible, and also with China as soon as possible. However, since diplomatic relations with China have not yet been restored, the government does not intend to directly negotiate with China on promoting trade. The decision also stated that the uncoordinated phenomenon of various non-governmental organizations negotiating with China as in the past is not good, and unified negotiations with China should be conducted in the future. To this end, an organization will be established within the Liberal Democratic Party to handle Sino-Japanese trade issues, and relevant cabinet members will study specific ways to conduct unified negotiations.
    After the cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister Nobusuke Kishi told reporters that Japan intends to increase the volume of trade with China and plans to establish private personnel in Beijing and Tokyo to be responsible for trade matters between the two countries.

    石桥内阁决定促进对我贸易
    打算在北京和东京互设民间贸易人员
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：新组成的石桥内阁在今天下午举行的首次会议上，讨论了新内阁对中国的外交方针。
    会议决定，今后要促进同中国的贸易，因此要努力促使放宽巴黎统筹委员会对中国的禁运限制，特别是要灵活运用特别批准制度。
    内阁会议还决定，关于承认中国以及同中国恢复邦交问题，要同联合国和“自由国家”集团调整意见以后再加以研究，日本不单独采取带头行动。
    关于促进日中贸易的问题，内阁会议决定，要尽早同美国等“自由国家”协商，也要尽早和中国协商，但是由于目前还没有同中国恢复邦交，所以政府不打算直接同中国进行关于促进贸易的谈判。决定又说，像过去那样由各种民间团体同中国谈判的不统一现象是不好的，今后要统一地同中国进行谈判。为此，要在自由民主党内设立一个处理日中贸易问题的机构，并且由有关阁员研究统一进行谈判的具体办法。
    在内阁会议以后，外务相岸信介向记者说，日本打算增加同中国的贸易量，并且在北京和东京互设民间的人员负责两国贸易事宜。
