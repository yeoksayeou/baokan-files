Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 30th. The restoration project of the Jinichengjiang-Duyun section of the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway has been completed. The first train after the restoration entered Duyun County, the seat of the People's Committee of the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, on the 28th.

This section of railway is 299 kilometers long. It was originally built during the Anti-Japanese War, but due to the low design standards and the inability to repair it, it gradually became paralyzed and unusable. In September 1955, the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army began restoration work. With the strong support of the people of Guangxi and Guizhou provinces, they finally completed the restoration project ahead of schedule.

    黔桂铁路通车到都匀
    据新华社贵阳30日电　黔桂铁路金城江—都匀段的铁路恢复工程已经完工。恢复后的第一趟列车，在28日开进了黔南布依族苗族自治州人民委员会所在地都匀县城。
    这段铁路全长二百九十九公里，原来建成于抗日战争期间，当时由于设计标准低，又无力修整，因而逐渐瘫痪不能使用。1955年9月中国人民解放军铁道兵开始进行修复工作。他们在广西、贵州两省人民大力支援下，终于提前完成了修复工程。
