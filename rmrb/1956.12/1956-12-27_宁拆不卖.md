Rather Destroy Than Sell

If you don't want something, and someone else needs it, wouldn't it be good to give it to them? Yet, there are those who are unwilling, preferring to destroy rather than relinquish it.

The construction project of the Jilin Dye Factory was originally contracted by the First Engineering Company of the Fifth Metallurgical Chemical Construction Corporation. Now, this company has been transferred to Chongqing, and the unfinished project is being continued by the Third Company. There is a steel structure concrete mixing station on the construction site that the Third Company wants to use, and they want to buy it from the First Company. The First Company is moving away, so it should be no problem to transfer it, especially since they are offering to pay for it. But they simply won't sell it. It is said that the First Company wants to dismantle the mixing station and transport it to Chongqing.

Let's not even talk about how much will be lost in the dismantling, or how much the transportation will cost; just the First Company dismantling it, and the Third Company rebuilding it – this deliberate plan to create waste is baffling enough.

    宁拆不卖
    自己不要的东西，别人需要，让给别人不好吗？然而，竟也有人不愿意，宁可拆掉，也不出让。
    吉林染料厂的建厂工程原来是第五冶金化学建筑总公司第一工程公司承包的，现在这个公司调往重庆去了，未完工程由第三公司继续。工地上有一座钢结构混凝土搅拌站，三公司还要利用，想从一公司买下来。一公司既要调走，按说出让不成问题吧，况且人家还出钱买。但就是不卖，据说一公司要把这搅拌站拆下来运到重庆去。
    先不说拆一拆，损失多少，运一次，费用多少；光说一公司来拆，三公司再建，这种故意制造浪费的打算，就够叫人莫名其妙的了。
