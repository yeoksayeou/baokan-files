    Where Did the Party Organization Go?
    Qian Yin
    After reading "An Encounter of a Female Worker After Marriage," people can't help but ask, out of anger, where did this factory's Party organization go? Where is the political work in the factory reflected?
    From the beginning of Wang Xizhen's pregnancy reactions until the birth of her child, huge changes occurred in her life and emotional state in this period of less than a year. An active and hardworking female worker became taciturn and haggard, and the leaders wouldn't let her continue with the grinding machine she had been fond of for over four years.
    All of this seems to be caused only by the workshop director Zhao Chuanren, the work section chief Du Rongchang and others who discriminated against female workers and did not care about their suffering. However, the responsibility cannot be solely attributed to the workshop director and the work section chief. If the machine tool factory's Party organization did not adopt an attitude of acquiescence and accommodation towards the practices of the workshop cadres, would Zhao Chuanren and others dare to be so bold and reckless?
    Perhaps some would say that the factory is so big, and there are so many people, and these people discriminate against female workers under the pretext of improving production, the factory's Party organization may not be able to fully understand the details, so it was not dealt with, which is excusable.
    We say that even so, the Party organization's responsibility cannot be shirked. The task of the Party organization in an enterprise is not only to ensure the completion of the production tasks assigned by the state, but also to ensure the implementation of the Party's policies in the enterprise, and to educate the masses with communist ideology. If the machine tool factory's Party organization does not understand this matter, it can only show that they have serious bureaucracy; if they understand this matter but stand by and do nothing, then people can't help but question them: why don't they even have basic human sympathy, and turn a blind eye to backward feudal ideas and behaviors that violate the Party's policies? How can they unite and educate the masses? How can they perform the glorious duty of "the Communist Party's grassroots organization"?

### 党组织哪里去了

    党组织哪里去了
    千音
    读了“一个女工婚后的遭遇”以后，气愤之余，人们不禁要问，这个厂的党组织哪里去了？厂里的政治工作又表现在哪里？
    王希珍从怀孕反应起，一直到孩子生下来，在这不到一年的时间里，生活上，思想感情上发生了巨大的变化。一个活泼勤劳的女工，变得沉默寡言，面容憔悴，搞了四年多一直眷恋着的磨床，领导上也不让她去了。
    这一切，看上去好像只是由于车间主任赵传仁、工段长杜荣昌等人歧视女工，不关心女工的疾苦所造成的。然而，决不能把责任仅仅归结到车间主任和工段长的身上。倘若机床厂的党组织对车间干部的做法，不是采取默认、迁就的态度，赵传仁等人敢这样大胆妄为吗？
    也许有人会说，一个厂子那么大，人员又是那样多，何况这些人歧视女工，又是以搞好生产为借口的，厂里的党组织不一定能完全摸清底细，因此未加处理，这是情有可原的。
    我们说，即使是这样，也仍然不能推卸掉党组织的责任。企业里党组织的任务不仅仅是保证完成国家交给的生产任务；而且要保证党的政策在企业中贯彻，要用共产主义思想去教育群众。如果机床厂的党组织不了解这件事，只能说明他们有严重的官僚主义；如果他们了解这件事而袖手旁观，无动于衷，那么，人们就忍不住要质问他们：为什么连起码的人类同情心都没有，对落后的封建思想和违反党的政策的行为，听之任之，这样，怎么能团结群众和教育群众呢？怎样来执行“共产党的基层组织”这个光荣的职责呢？
