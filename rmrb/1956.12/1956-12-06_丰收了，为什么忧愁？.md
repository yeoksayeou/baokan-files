Harvest, Why Worry?
By our commentator

A bumper harvest is supposed to be a happy event, but in some places it has brought trouble and worry to farmers. Isn't this a strange phenomenon?

In Mengcun Hui Autonomous County, Hebei, a sweet potato harvest has left farmers worried. What are they worried about? Mainly that there are too many sweet potatoes, and it's not easy to sell them even for a penny a pound. Too many sweet potatoes were retained in the unified purchase of food (four pounds of sweet potatoes equated to one pound of grain), and some commune members received more than half of their rations in sweet potatoes. It's not good to eat too much, can't be sold, and difficult to store, so the farmers are worried. Other places that planted a lot of sweet potatoes have similar problems. In some communes in Shandong that grew too many sweet potatoes, commune members sighed as they looked at the piles of sweet potatoes: "We can't just eat sweet potatoes for socialism!"

Sweet potatoes are a high-yielding crop, with good harvests reaching 10,000 jin per mu. Precisely because of this, many places this year have extensively promoted sweet potatoes as an important measure to achieve high-yield targets. In some places, the planting area of sweet potatoes has expanded several times or even dozens of times. In Hebei and Shandong, sweet potatoes account for a considerable proportion of the increased production figures. Increased production is certainly a good thing; however, it is not easy to change farmers' eating habits overnight. After the sweet potato harvest, the leading organs in some places paid attention to the allocation of grain varieties, organized farmers to carry out sideline production using sweet potatoes as raw materials, developed pig raising, and conducted timely ideological education on this issue. In this case, although more sweet potatoes were retained, the problem was generally solved. But not all sweet potato producing areas have solved this problem well. In these places, farmers inevitably express various complaints.

Does this mean that this high-yielding crop should not be promoted? We can't say that. Increasing the yield of crops by all means is an important task of agricultural production; and promoting high-yielding crops is still one of the important ways to increase crop yields. Although sweet potatoes are not a very good staple food, they can still replace some grain when eaten with other grains. In addition, sweet potatoes can be used to make flour, brew wine, and be used as pig feed, etc. From a national perspective, the planting area of sweet potatoes is not excessive. In the future, it is still necessary to appropriately expand the planting area of sweet potatoes. However, in specific arrangements, we should learn from this year's experience and lessons. We must consider both the increase in production and the needs of the country, and also take care of the food habits and living needs of commune members. Ignoring specific conditions and mass habits, and not conducting persuasive education among the masses, but blindly expanding the sweet potato planting area to make up production figures, will inevitably lead to alienation from the masses. It is said that some farmers raised objections during the spring sowing, saying that it would be difficult to deal with planting too much. Some cadres replied: "As long as production increases, the state has a solution." However, after the harvest, when faced with specific problems, the leadership failed to solve them in time, and there were many difficulties in long-distance transportation of sweet potatoes, which further increased farmers' dissatisfaction. No wonder some farmers said: Planting too many sweet potatoes was a trick, and they would not plant any more next year.

It is understood that some counties in Liaoning expanded the planting area of corn this year, and reduced sorghum. The farmers here are accustomed to sorghum as their staple food. This year, a lot of corn was kept as rations, which changed the eating habits of the farmers, and the farmers also had opinions.

Currently, various places are formulating production plans and arranging next year's production. This issue deserves attention. It should be affirmed that high-yielding crops such as corn and sweet potatoes should be appropriately promoted and developed. However, when specifically arranging the sowing area, we need to consider it from many aspects. On the one hand, we must consider the needs of the country, and on the other hand, we must take care of the habits of the farmers; if farmers are unwilling to plant too much of what was planted too much this year, it can be appropriately reduced; those who plant less and have planting conditions still need to educate farmers to develop appropriately. The national plan must be guaranteed to be completed, but on the premise of completing the national plan, the cooperatives should be allowed to decide their own planting plans, and the cooperatives should not be forced to implement them. Of course, the production and living habits of farmers are not unchangeable, but when changing, they must understand the truth of the change and consciously and voluntarily rise up to change. Forcing them to change will only cause dissatisfaction among farmers, which is not good for the country or the farmers.

### 丰收了，为什么忧愁？

　　丰收了，为什么忧愁？
    本报评论员
    丰产丰收本来是件喜事，可是在有些地方却给农民带来了烦恼和忧愁。这不是奇怪的现象么？
    河北孟村回族自治县甘薯丰收了，但是这里的农民却发了愁。他们愁什么呢？主要是甘薯太多了，一分钱一斤也不容易卖出去。统购留粮中甘薯留的过多（四斤薯折一斤粮）有些社员分到的口粮半数以上是甘薯。吃又不好多吃，卖也卖不出去，保存又不好保存，于是，农民就发了愁。其他一些多种了甘薯的地方，也有类似问题发生。山东有些种薯太多的社，社员们望着甘薯堆叹气：“为社会主义也不能光吃甘薯啊！”
    甘薯是高产作物，收成好的每亩可达万斤。正是因为这样，今年不少地方都以大量推广甘薯作为实现高额丰产指标的重要措施。有些地方甘薯的种植面积一下扩大了几倍甚至十几倍。河北、山东有些县份增产数字中甘薯占相当大的比重。增产了当然是好事情；可是，要一下改变农民的吃粮习惯，却并不是一件很轻易的事情。有些地方的领导机关，在甘薯丰收之后，注意粮种调配，组织农民开展以甘薯作原料的副业生产，发展养猪业，并且及时进行了有关这个问题的思想教育工作。在这情况下，甘薯虽然留得较多，问题一般也得到解决。但并不是所有多产甘薯的地方都比较好地解决了这个问题。在这些地方，农民便不免发出这样那样的怨言。
    这是不是说这种高产作物不该推广呢？不能这样说。用一切办法提高农作物产量，这是农业生产的重要任务；而推广高产作物，仍然是提高农作物产量的重要途径之一。甘薯虽不是很好的口粮，但和其他粮种调剂食用还是可以顶一部分粮食的。此外，甘薯还可以作粉、酿酒、作猪饲料等等。从全国范围来说，甘薯的种植面积还不是过多了，今后适当扩大甘薯种植面积还是必要的。但是，在具体安排上，应该吸取今年的经验教训。既要考虑到产量的增加和国家的需要，也要照顾社员的吃粮习惯和生活需要。不顾具体条件和群众习惯，不向群众进行说服教育，只是以盲目扩大甘薯种植面积来硬凑增产数字，就必然会脱离群众。据说在春季播种的时候，有些农民就提出过意见，说种的太多不好办。有的干部就答复说：“只要增了产，国家有办法。”可是，收获之后，碰到具体问题，领导方面却未能及时解决，甘薯远程调运又有很多困难，这样就更增加了农民的不满情绪。难怪有的农民说：多种甘薯是上了当，明年说什么也不多种了。
    据了解，辽宁有些县今年扩大了玉米播种面积，高粱减少了。这里农民习惯以高粱为主食，今年留了很多玉米作口粮，改变了农民的吃粮习惯，农民也有意见。
    目前，各地正在制定生产计划安排明年生产，对这个问题值得加以注意。玉米、甘薯等高产作物要适当地推广和发展，这是应该肯定的。但在具体安排播种面积的时候，需要从多方面加以考虑。一方面要考虑国家的需要，一方面也要照顾农民的习惯；今年种得太多的如果农民不愿再多种，可以适当缩小些；种得少而又有种植条件的，还需要教育农民适当发展些。国家计划必须保证完成，但在完成国家计划的前提下，应当允许合作社自己决定自己的种植计划，不能硬性命令合作社执行。当然农民的生产生活习惯，并不是不可改变的，但改变的时候一定要他自己懂得改变的道理，自觉自愿地起来改变。强迫他们改变，只会引起农民的不满，这对国家对农民都没有好处。
