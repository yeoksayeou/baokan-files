Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 18th dispatch: According to TASS, the number of workers participating in production in factories across Hungary reached 95% on the 17th. The factories in Csepel, the metallurgical factories in Miskolc and Borsod, the machine manufacturing plants in Győr and Debrecen, and the metallurgical and machine manufacturing factories in Dunaújváros, Pécs, Szolnok, and other cities are increasingly supplying the country with products.

The output of the coal mining industry is also gradually increasing. In recent days, coal miners have been producing 20,000 to 25,000 tons of coal per day and night. All employees of industrial enterprises are making every effort to help coal miners reach their previous levels of coal production.

On the streets of Budapest, there are more and more trams, trolleybuses, and buses. To welcome Christmas, Christmas trees and Christmas tree decorations have begun to be sold in the markets. Many theaters in Budapest, after a break of nearly two months, have now begun to perform again. The Opera House, the People's Army Theater, the National Puppet Theater, and other theaters all had performances on the 16th. The construction work on many streets in the capital that were damaged during the rebellion is being expanded. Many damaged residences have been repaired, and the original residents have moved back in.

In the countryside, news has come from many areas that the dissolved agricultural production cooperatives are being restored. For example, in the past few days, twenty production cooperatives have been restored in Somogy County. In Szolnok County, forty-nine production cooperatives that had been dissolved have now also begun to work. In the suburbs of Budapest, there were originally twenty-two production cooperatives; only three were dissolved during the events. Now, most of the members of these three cooperatives have re-expressed their desire to work together.
