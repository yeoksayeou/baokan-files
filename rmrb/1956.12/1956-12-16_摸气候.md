    Feeling Out the Climate
  　Ye Qu
    In rural areas, especially in regions with cash crops, the weather—cold, warm, sunny, rainy—has a significant impact on crops. Farmers must pay attention to the weather every day to decide what work to do in the fields. Farmers' "feeling out the climate" can be said to be using a little bit of astronomical knowledge to observe the weather.
    But now in the cities, a new term has become popular among some cadres, called "feeling out the climate." This "feeling out the climate" is, of course, very different from the farmers' "feeling out the climate." This "feeling out the climate" means being good at "feeling out the climate" of this leading organization, being good at "feeling out the climate" of that leading organization; being good at "feeling out the climate" of this leader, being good at "feeling out the climate" of that leader. This "feeling out the climate" means always catering to the superior's intentions, regardless of whether those intentions are realistic, even to the point of falsifying things, reporting only good news and not bad. If translated into the most common language, it means "opportunism" and "flattery."
    In Chinese history, there have been quite a few people good at "feeling out the climate," throughout the dynasties. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, there was a man named Wen Tiren, who was appointed as a minister during the reign of Emperor Chongzhen. Wen Tiren was very good at "feeling out the climate," and history says that he was able to "win the favor of the emperor." What methods did he use to win the favor of this Emperor Chongzhen? It is said that every day when he went to court, Wen Tiren would put two copies of memorials in his sleeves. If he saw the emperor in a happy mood, he would present one memorial; if he saw the emperor in a bad mood, he would present the other memorial. In this way, Emperor Chongzhen always felt very comfortable. Later, when Emperor Chongzhen hanged himself on Coal Hill, he lamented: "The court is full of high-ranking officials, but there is not a single loyal subject!" With a minister like Wen Tiren who was so good at "feeling out the climate," this emperor would naturally never hear any unpleasant words and would never be able to understand the actual situation.
    This bad habit of "feeling out the climate" has not yet disappeared in our new society. Under some leaders who are divorced from reality, divorced from the masses, fond of boasting and exaggeration, and full of bureaucratic airs, people who are accustomed to making false reports and fabricating false materials naturally emerge. They flatter and fawn, and are not ashamed. People who are good at "feeling out the climate" feel that they don't need to improve their politics, improve their thinking, improve their professional knowledge, don't need to work conscientiously, don't need to conduct thorough investigations and research, and truthfully reflect the situation. As long as they "feel out the climate" in their movements and gestures, then they can rise straight up without climbing.
    I think this trend of "feeling out the climate" must be condemned. People who "feel out the climate" are like蛀虫(zhùchóng) in a tree, unknowingly, quietly, quietly eroding the tree trunk. Just one蛀虫(zhùchóng) can hollow out even a large tree. How should the people, as the trunk of the tree, be vigilant against the蛀虫(zhùchóng) among people!

    摸气候
  　野渠
    在农村里，特别是经济作物的地区，气候冷、暖、晴、雨，对于农作物是有不小影响的。农民每天都要关心地摸摸气候，决定田地里的当天工作。农民的摸气候，可以说，就是用一点天文常识来看天气。
    但是现在城市里，有些干部中也流行着这么一个新名词，叫做“摸气候”。这个摸气候，当然和农民的摸气候是大不相同的。这个摸气候是所谓：善于摸这个领导机关的气候，善于摸那个领导机关的气候；善于摸这个领导人的气候，善于摸那个领导人的气候。这个摸气候就是不管上级意图是否切合实际，总是一味迎合，不惜弄虚作假，报喜不报忧。如果把它译成最通俗的话，就是“投机取巧”，“拍马屁”。
    在中国历史上，善于摸气候的人是并不少的，历代都有。明末就有一个温体仁，崇祯皇帝时，官拜尚书。这温体仁是最善于摸气候的，历史上说他能“自结于上”。他用什么办法来自结于这位崇祯皇帝呢？据说每天上朝，温体仁的袖子里放着两份奏章，看见皇帝高兴的脸色，呈一份奏章；看见皇帝不高兴的脸色，呈另一份奏章。这样，使得崇祯皇帝心里总是很舒服。后来，崇祯皇帝吊死煤山时感慨地说：“满朝大紫大红，没有一个忠臣！”既然有温体仁这样善于摸气候的臣子，这位皇帝自然永远听不到逆耳之言，也永远不能了解实际情况了。
    这个摸气候的坏风气在我们的新社会里却也还没有绝迹。在有些脱离实际、脱离群众、好大喜功、官僚气味十足的领导人下面，就自然而然地产生了惯于打假报告、编假材料的人。他们拍马逢迎，不以为耻。善于摸气候的人，觉得不需要提高政治、提高思想、提高业务知识，不需要兢兢业业地工作，不需要确确实实地调查研究，真实地反映情况，只要在进退俯仰之间摸气候，那么，就可以不用攀登，也能直升而上。
    我以为对于这种摸气候的风气必须谴责。摸气候的人像树中的蛀虫，它神不知鬼不觉，悄悄地悄悄地侵蚀着树身，只要一只蛀虫就可以把一棵那怕是大树蛀空。作为树身的人们应当怎样警惕着人中的蛀虫呵！
