    Too Much is as Bad as Too Little

    Since the "opening up" of theatrical repertoire, cultural departments in various regions have actively organized opera performers to excavate traditional plays. For example, in Hainan Island, Guangdong Province, Hainan opera has unearthed more than 300 plays. In Fujian Province, Min opera, Gaojia opera, Xiang opera, Liyuan opera, Puxian opera and other opera genres have unearthed more than 6,000 plays in total. The work of identifying Sichuan opera plays in Sichuan Province was already underway, but there has been further progress recently, with more than 1,200 plays unearthed. At the same time, many opera troupes have staged traditional plays and brought out classic old plays, creating a magnificent scene of "letting a hundred flowers bloom." The Peking opera "Si Lang Visits His Mother," which has not been performed for many years, is one of the countless plays that have been restaged. There are also some plays that I, in my ignorance, have never seen before. For example, Shangdang opera's "Three Passes Banquet" depicts the story of She Taijun and Empress Dowager Xiao holding a banquet at the Three Passes. She Taijun wants Yang Silang to return, Princess Iron Mirror smashes her child to death and then kills herself in front of the steps. Yang Silang is finally brought back to the Southern Dynasty by She Taijun and is forced to kill himself in the palace. Another example is the Sichuan opera "Meeting Behind the Tent," where Princess Iron Mirror takes her son to the Song camp to meet Yang Silang and is persuaded to surrender to the Song Dynasty, and so on. If it weren't for the "opening up" of repertoire, these moving legends would probably never see the light of day. This is something to be greatly rejoiced about.

    However, in this garden where a hundred flowers are blooming, many thorns and thistles have also grown recently, and careless people will be pricked and tripped over. If you open the newspapers in various regions and carefully look at the advertisements for plays being staged, you will find that many plays with harmful content are being performed. More troupes do not advertise in newspapers, so it is impossible to see the full picture of plays being staged in various regions from the newspapers. In fact, even poisonous plays such as "Splitting the Coffin," "Killing a Son for Revenge," "The Iron Rooster," and "Old Woman Opening the Bang" have "returned to life" on the stage under the guise of "letting a hundred flowers bloom."

    The "opening up" of repertoire has broken all kinds of old and new prohibitions on plays, corrected the crude style of "one word to kill it" in repertoire work, and provided a strong guarantee for the revival, accumulation, and prosperity of opera repertoire. This is a great thing. But this does not mean that all plays can be performed arbitrarily regardless of their content. Literature and art have a social education function—good plays benefit people, and bad plays harm people. This is an undeniable objective truth. Some plays may not necessarily have any positive educational significance in terms of ideological content, but can give people aesthetic enjoyment or improve people's sentiments, which are also good. If we acknowledge that drama has a social effect, then we cannot but acknowledge that there should still be certain standards for plays being staged now: as long as they do not promote counter-revolution, are not obscene, not terrifying, and do not promote feudal and backward fatalistic ideas, they can be staged; conversely, all those that are politically reactionary, obscene, terrifying, or promote feudal and backward fatalistic ideas should not be staged. There are also some plays that, from the script, do not have any problems or have minor problems, but are unbearable to watch once they are performed. For example, the Peking opera "Hongniang" is often performed as a pornographic play by some unserious actors, and the play "Painted Skin," which has positive significance, is often performed very terrifyingly by some troupes. Therefore, the problem with these plays is not in the repertoire but in the performance. This kind of bad performance should also be corrected.

    Some people say that the lives of performers are too hard, and they perform these plays because they are more popular, which is something they have to do. These plays have not been performed for a long time, so they attract audiences, but the audience's curiosity will gradually disappear. More importantly, the audience's level is improving day by day. Over time, these plays will eventually be abandoned by the audience. Some plays that were full every night when they were first "opened up" now have fewer and fewer viewers. The fundamental way to win over audiences is to enrich excellent (or at least harmless) repertoire and improve the quality of performances. All progressive artists can distinguish right from wrong. They say that they will never use bad plays to appeal to audiences and attract business. Their conscience and social responsibility do not allow them to do so; they also know that doing so will not bring them any real benefits.

    Some critics have a bellyful of opinions about this phenomenon but dare not offer criticism, fearing the risk of violating the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend." I think this concern is unnecessary. Since you support "contention," then why shouldn't you, the critic, "contend" a little? As long as the "contention" is appropriate, it will never form a restoration of prohibitions, but will be of great benefit to the healthy development of the opera cause.

    过犹不及
    屠岸
    自从戏曲剧目“开放”以来，各地文化主管部门都积极组织戏曲艺人发掘传统剧目。如广东省海南岛的琼剧就已发掘出三百多个剧目，福建省的闽剧、高甲戏、芗剧、梨园戏、蒲仙戏等剧种共已发掘了六千多个剧目，四川省的川剧剧目鉴定工作本来早就在做，近来更有进展，已发掘一千二百多个剧目。与此同时，许多戏曲剧团纷纷上演传统剧目，搬出骨子老戏，“百花齐放”，蔚为大观。多年不演的京剧“四郎探母”就是重新演出的无数剧目之一。还有些戏是孤陋寡闻的我过去从未看过的。例如上党戏的“三关排宴”，内容是佘太君与萧太后在三关排宴，佘太君要杨四郎回去，铁镜公主摔死孩子，自己碰死在阶前，四郎终于被佘太君带回南朝，被迫碰死在殿上；又如川剧“后帐会”，铁镜公主带了儿子偷到宋营与杨四郎会见，被说服投降宋朝，等等。像这些动人的传奇，要不是“剧目开放”，恐怕永远见不得天日。这是值得大大高兴的。
    但在这百花盛开的花园里，近来也长出了不少荆棘和蒺藜，不小心的人是会被刺伤和绊倒的。翻开各地报纸，仔细去看看各地的上演剧目广告，就会发现不少内容有害的戏在上演；更多的剧团是不在报上登广告的，因此从报纸上还无法看到各地上演剧目的全貌。事实上是连“大劈棺”、“杀子报”、“铁公鸡”、“老妈开嗙”等有毒的戏，也在“百花齐放”的借口下“还魂”到舞台上来了。
    剧目“开放”打破了各式各样旧的和新的对剧目的清规戒律，纠正了剧目工作中“一言以毙之”之类的粗暴作风，为戏曲剧目的翻身、积累、繁荣提供了有力的保证。这是天大的好事。但这并不是说因此一切剧目都可以不问其内容，任意演出了。文学艺术具有社会教育作用——好戏使人得益，坏戏使人受害，这是无法否定的客观真理。有些戏虽然在思想内容上不一定有什么积极的教育意义，但能给人以美的享受，或能提高人的情操，也是好的。如果承认戏剧是具有社会效果的，那就不能不承认现在上演剧目仍然应当有一定的标准：只要不宣传反革命、不淫秽、不恐怖、不宣传封建落后的宿命观念，就可以上演；反之，凡是政治上反动、淫秽、恐怖、宣传封建落后的宿命观念的，就不应当上演。还有一些戏，从剧本上看并没有什么毛病或毛病不大，但一经演出就看不下去，例如京剧“红娘”就往往被某些不严肃的演员演成色情戏，有积极意义的戏“画皮”也往往被某些剧团演得十分恐怖。因此，这些戏的问题不在剧目而在表演。这种不好的表演也是应当纠正的。
    有人说，艺人生活太苦了，他们演出这些戏，可以较为叫座，在他们是不得已的。这些戏长期不演出，因而吸引了观众，但观众的好奇心会逐渐消失，更重要的是，观众的水平正在日益提高，日子久了，这些戏终究会被观众抛弃的。有些在刚“开放”时场场客满的戏，现在观众逐渐减少了。争取观众的根本办法在于丰富优良（至少是无害的）剧目，提高演出质量。一切进步的艺人都能明辨是非，他们表示决不以演坏戏来号召观众，招徕生意，他们的良心和社会责任感不允许他们这样做；他们也知道这样做不会给他们带来真正的好处。
    有些批评家对这种现象虽有满腹意见，却不敢提出批评，唯恐冒违反“百花齐放、百家争鸣”政策的危险。我看这顾虑大可不必。你既然拥护“争鸣”，那么你这位批评“家”就何妨来“鸣”它一下？只要“鸣”得恰当，就决不会形成清规戒律的复辟，而对戏曲事业的健康发展，却大有好处。
