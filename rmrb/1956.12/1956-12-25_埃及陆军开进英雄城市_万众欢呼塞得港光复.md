Xinhua News Agency, December 24th: Port Said dispatch: Amidst the cheers of the jubilant masses celebrating the liberation of Port Said, Egyptian army units, led by tanks and artillery towed by vehicles, entered Port Said on the morning of December 23rd.

    The first tank bore the inscription "Port Said" in large characters, paying tribute to this heroic city. As these tanks rumbled into the square in front of the train station, groups of joyous people rushed to jump on them. People sang and danced with abandon, shouting slogans such as "Long live Nasser!" "Down with the warmongers Eden, Mollet, and Ben-Gurion!" "Port Said wants freedom and peace!"

    On this day, Port Said, returned to the hands of the Egyptian people, was adorned in festive decorations. Rooftops and windows were covered with national flags and portraits of Nasser. The barbed wire left behind by the invaders had been removed. The church bells rang out clearly. People, with irrepressible excitement, poured into the square from all directions, where they saw the beloved national flag rise again, fluttering in the air. Many people had been reluctant to leave the streets since the evening of December 22nd, when the Anglo-French invaders withdrew. Others went to the seashore specifically to see the last place where the invaders retreated. Coffee shops were packed with happy people.

    However, the evidence of the invaders' crimes was still vivid. Amid the cheers, many people were still searching for remaining items near the rubble with tears in their eyes. Many people were accusing the invaders of their crimes to acquaintances or strangers.

    That afternoon, the Egyptian army and police took over all areas of Port Said, and the United Nations Emergency Force retreated into the barracks. The commander of the United Nations Emergency Force in Port Said said that his first batch of troops was scheduled to withdraw from Port Said on the 24th. A communique issued by the United Nations Emergency Force authorities on the evening of December 23rd stated, "With the withdrawal of the British and French, the second phase of the United Nations Emergency Force's operation—following the Israeli (army) withdrawing from Sinai—is expected to proceed at high speed." The communique stated that new troops would be advancing on four roads in the Sinai Peninsula from the 24th.

    Meanwhile, the Egyptian capital, Cairo, was also filled with an atmosphere of joy and excitement for the liberation of Port Said. President Nasser has already sent a telegram to the people of Port Said congratulating them on the victory of their heroic struggle against the invaders. Heads of Arab states such as the President of Syria and the King of Saudi Arabia have sent telegrams to Nasser to express their congratulations.

    Cairo's newspapers all hailed this memorable day. Many newspapers especially expressed gratitude to Asian and African countries for their full support of Egypt's struggle.

    The Egyptian authorities have also begun to support the people of Port Said in their post-disaster recovery and reconstruction efforts. The first batch of Egyptian doctors and trains carrying various supplies have already left for Port Said. The newly appointed Minister of Port Said Affairs, Baghdadi, said on the 23rd that he and his assistants would go to Port Said within forty-eight hours, where they would work until Port Said was rebuilt. He estimated that it would take only six months to rebuild the new Port Said.

    An Egyptian army spokesman said on the 23rd that Port Said has been declared a closed city, and no one may enter or leave without the permission of the Army Headquarters. Egyptian officials said that Port Said would not be reopened until public health personnel had disinfected the city and given residents vaccinations.

    Cairo's blackout was lifted on the evening of December 23rd. People walking under bright streetlights for the first time in more than a month were filled with the smiles of victors.

    埃及陆军开进英雄城市
    万众欢呼塞得港光复
    新华社24日讯　塞得港消息：在为塞得港光复而狂欢的万众欢呼声中，以坦克和汽车牵引的大炮为前导的埃及陆军部队在12月23日上午开进了塞得港。
    第一辆坦克上大字写着“塞得港”字样以表示对这个英雄城市的敬意。当这些坦克隆隆地歌唱着开入火车站前面的广场时，成群欢乐的人争先跳上去。人们尽情歌唱舞蹈。他们高呼“纳赛尔万岁！”“打倒战争贩子艾登、摩勒和本—古里安！”“塞得港要自由和和平！”等口号。
    这一天，重新回到埃及人民手里的塞得港披上了节日的装饰。屋顶上、窗口，到处是国旗和纳赛尔肖像。侵略者留下的铁丝网已经撤除。教堂的钟声嘹亮地响起来。人们怀着抑制不住的兴奋从四面八方涌向广场，他们在那里看到亲爱祖国的国旗重新升起来飘扬在空中。许多人从12月22日晚上英法侵略者撤退的时候起一直就舍不得离开大街。也有许多人特地跑到海边去亲眼看看侵略者最后退走的那块地方。咖啡店里挤满了欢乐的人们。
    但是侵略者的罪证仍然历历在目。在欢乐声中也仍然有许多人噙着眼泪在瓦砾堆边寻找残留的物品。许多人在向相识或不相识的人控诉侵略者的罪行。
    这一天下午，埃及陆军和警察接收了塞得港的全部地区，联合国紧急部队退进了兵营。塞得港联合国紧急部队司令说，他的第一批部队预定在24日撤出塞得港。联合国紧急部队当局在12月23日晚上发表的公报说，“随着英法的撤退，联合国紧急部队行动的第二阶段——跟上从西奈撤退的以色列（军队）——可望以高速度前进。”公报说，从24日起，西奈半岛的四条道路上都将有新的军队推进。
    同时，在埃及首都开罗，也充满着为塞得港光复而欢欣鼓舞的气氛。纳赛尔总统已经致电塞得港人民祝贺他们抵抗侵略者的英勇斗争的胜利。叙利亚总统和沙特阿拉伯国王等阿拉伯国家首脑纷纷致电纳赛尔表示祝贺。
    开罗各报都欢呼值得纪念的这一天。许多报纸特别对亚非国家全力支持埃及的斗争表示感激。
    埃及当局同时也已经开始支援劫后塞得港人民恢复建设的工作。第一批埃及医生和载着各种物品的火车已经前往塞得港。新任命的塞得港事务部部长巴格达迪23日说，他和他的助手们要在四十八小时内前往塞得港，他们将在那里工作到塞得港重建起来为止，他估计，只要六个月就可以重建起新的塞得港。
    埃及陆军发言人23日说，塞得港已被宣布为不开放的城市，没有得到陆军总部的许可，任何人不得进出。埃及官员说，一直要到公共卫生人员把这个城市消毒并且为居民进行预防注射之后，塞得港才将重新开放。
    开罗的灯火管制已经在12月23日晚上起取消了，一个多月来第一次在明亮的街灯下行走的人们充满了胜利者的笑容。
