    Xinhua News Agency, December 6th: A dispatch from New York by Agence France-Presse says that Israeli representative to the United Nations, Abba Eban, is said to have reached an agreement "in principle" with Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 5th to allow the International Police Force to enter the 30-mile-wide Sinai Peninsula area east of the Suez Canal. However, it is believed that Eban did not "offer any guarantee regarding the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Sinai Peninsula or the Gaza Strip."

　　以色列拒不保证全部撤军
　  海法港有新到的英法部队
    新华社6日讯　法新社从纽约发出来的一条消息说，据说以色列驻联合国代表阿巴·伊班已经在5日同秘书长哈马舍尔德“在原则上”达成协议，让国际警察部队进驻苏伊士运河以东的三十里宽的西奈半岛地带。可是，人们认为伊班并没有“就以色列军队从西奈半岛或加沙地带全部撤出的问题提出任何保证”。　　新华社6日讯　据塔斯社开罗5日讯：据中东通讯社报道，以色列的海法港有新调来的英、法军队，并且有新运到的军事装备。这条消息指出，这些部队没有同以色列一块参加过对埃及的侵略，显然是一种增援力量。
