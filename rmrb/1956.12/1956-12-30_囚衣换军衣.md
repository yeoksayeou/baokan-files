　　Prison Uniforms Exchanged for Military Uniforms
　　Recently, West German Defense Minister Strauss once again patted his chest and assured the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that West Germany would establish an army of 500,000 troops as soon as possible.

　　However, the Bonn government has encountered many difficulties in recruiting soldiers, which is already well known. The West German Ministry of Defense recently publicly admitted that West Germany's rearmament plan for this year has failed. Although a large number of former Hitler's SS soldiers have put on new uniforms, the number of soldiers is still less than two-thirds of the original number.

　　Therefore, people cannot help but wonder: What kind of magic weapon do people like Strauss have that enables them to be so confident in piecing together the Bundeswehr?

　　A recent news report in a West German newspaper revealed this secret.

　　Some time ago, the Bonn government decided to establish so-called "reformatories" to educate criminals. Recently, "reformatories" composed of military commissioners from the West German Ministry of Defense have begun to go to prisons in many cities to conduct "reformatory education" for young criminals. This kind of "reformatory education" is very unique. The military commissioner takes out a enlistment application form that has been completely filled out and hands it to the young criminal, telling him that if he volunteers to join the new Bundeswehr, then even if he has committed the most serious crime, he can be released within six months. Some heinous criminals, in order to seek pardon, naturally prefer to enlist in the army. The Bonn Ministry of Defense has obtained some new recruits by means of this kind of "reformatory education."

　　People remember that West German militarists once boasted that they would form an army of "first-class quality"; American generals and officials on the other side of the ocean have also repeatedly touted the West German army being built as the "core" of the "strength" of the North Atlantic aggressive group. Perhaps it is quite in line with the wishes of West German militarists and American generals for West German criminals to take off their prison uniforms and put on military uniforms. However, this is inevitably too profound a satire on the signboard of this "first-class quality" army and the "strength" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. (Sheng)

    囚衣换军衣
    最近，西德国防部长施特劳斯又拍着胸膛向北大西洋集团保证，西德将尽快建立起五十万武装部队。
    但是波恩政府在招兵买马当中遭到了重重困难，这已经是人所皆知的事情了。西德国防部不久以前才公开承认，西德今年的重新武装计划已告破产。虽然让大批以前希特勒的党卫军穿上了新军服，兵员还是达不到原定数目的三分之二。
    因此，人们不能不发生疑问：究竟施特劳斯之流究竟有什么样的法宝使得他们在拼凑国防军方面能够这样地满怀自信呢？
    最近西德报纸所报道的一则新闻揭露了这一秘密。
    前些时候波恩政府决定要成立对罪犯进行教育工作的所谓
  “感化队”。最近，由西德国防部军事特派员组成的“感化队”已开始到许多城市的监狱里去对青年罪犯进行“感化教育”了。这种“感化教育”是十分别致的。军事特派员拿出一张已经全部填好了的新兵入伍的志愿书交给青年罪犯，告诉他说：如果他志愿参加新的国防军，那末即使他犯了最重的罪行，在半年之内就可以获释，一些罪大恶极的罪犯为了求得赦免，自然宁愿入伍当兵。波恩的国防部就靠了这种进行“感化教育”的方式，弄到了一些新兵。
    人们记得，西德的军国主义分子曾经大事吹嘘要组成“素质第一流”的军队；大洋彼岸的美国将军和官员们，也曾一再把正在建立中的西德军队推许为北大西洋侵略集团“实力”的“核心”。也许西德的罪犯们脱下囚衣换上军衣，是颇合乎西德军国主义分子和美国将军们的心意的。不过这未免对这个“素质第一流”的军队的招牌和北大西洋集团的“实力”是一个过于深刻的讽刺了。（生）
