Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 7th. The first 12,000 kW turbine designed and manufactured by China itself completed its final assembly at the state-owned Shanghai Turbine Factory on the afternoon of the 6th, and the test run was very successful.

　　This fifty-ton turbine was placed on a high test stand. After high-temperature steam was sent into the turbine, the heart of the turbine – the impeller and main rotor – began to rotate. As the steam gradually increased, the speed of the impeller also gradually increased. People saw on the instruments that when it was running at 3,000 revolutions per minute, the vibration of the bearings was less than one-hundredth of a millimeter. At this time, Czech expert Xu Naide, who helped China manufacture this turbine, shook hands with the people on the test stand to congratulate them, praising the Chinese workers for being able to produce such a good turbine in such a short period of time.

　　This turbine was designed and trial-produced on the basis of small-batch production of 2,500 kW and 6,000 kW turbines. Therefore, this turbine, which has twice the output of the 6,000 kW turbine, took only more than five months and more than 20,000 man-hours from the start of material input to the test run, while the trial production of the first 6,000 kW turbine took a full two years and more than 100,000 man-hours.

　　The electricity generated by this turbine in conjunction with a 12,000 kW generator and boiler can supply lighting for a city with a population of 600,000 or a coal mine producing 5 million tons of coal per year. Although the output of this turbine is equal to two 6,000 kW turbines, it only requires one and a half times the materials of a 6,000 kW turbine, and can save 1,000 tons of coal per year.

    ＊上海机械工业的新技术成就＊
　　一万二千瓩汽轮机顺利试车
    据新华社上海7日电　中国自己设计制造的第一台一万二千瓩汽轮机，6日下午在国营上海汽轮机厂完成总装配，试车情况很顺利。
    这台五十吨重的汽轮机被放在高高的试车台上。当高温蒸汽送进汽轮机以后，汽轮机的心脏——叶轮和主轮转动了。随着蒸汽的逐渐增加，叶轮的转速也逐渐加快了。人们在仪表上看到，当它运转到每分钟三千转的时候，轴承的震动还不到一公丝。这时，帮助我国制造这台汽轮机的捷克斯洛伐克专家许乃德，在试车台上同人们握手祝贺，夸奖中国工人能够在这么短的时间内，造出这样好的汽轮机。
    这台汽轮机是在小批生产二千五百瓩和六千瓩汽轮机的基础上进行设计试制的。因此这台比六千瓩出力大一倍的汽轮机，从投料到试车，只花了五个多月，二万多个工时，而第一台六千瓩汽轮机的试造，却整整花了两年多的时间，十多万个工时。
    这台汽轮机配合一万二千瓩发电机和锅炉所发出的电力，可以供应六十万人口的城市照明或年产五百万吨煤的煤矿使用。这台汽轮机的出力虽然等于两台六千瓩的汽轮机，而材料只要六千瓩汽轮机的一台半，用煤每年可以节省一千吨。
