Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou Telegram: The Liming Agricultural Cooperative in Lianhua Township, Haicheng County, Fujian Province, harvested an average of 1,455 jin of dry grain per mu for both early and late rice crops this year on 7,735 mu of land, an increase of more than 40% compared to last year. Such a large-scale bumper harvest is still rare.

Calculating all income from agriculture, animal husbandry, orchards, and fish farming in the cooperative, each workday can be allocated two yuan. According to preliminary distribution results, the income of 91.9% of the cooperative members has increased.

The Liming Agricultural Cooperative is led by Huang Haicheng, a national youth socialist activist. The cooperative members, together with the people of the surrounding townships, have jointly built two large-scale water conservancy projects and have independently constructed many small reservoirs and irrigation canals, basically eliminating the threat of drought. At the same time, they have adopted a method that combines the experiences of other regions with the experiences of local experienced farmers, and have widely promoted various bumper harvest experiences and advanced technologies. All double-cropping rice planted by the cooperative this year was densely planted, 90% of the rice paddies were planted with high-quality rice varieties such as Nantao No. 1 and Qinggu, and rational fertilization and irrigation experiences were improved and promoted, ensuring that all early and late rice crops grew well. In addition, they also adopted methods such as digging peat to make granular fertilizer, reducing production costs by about 30% compared to the past, thus achieving both increased production and increased income.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun Telegram: The Liming Agricultural Cooperative of Dagangzi Township, Qian Gorlos Mongol Autonomous County, Jilin Province, achieved excellent results by harvesting 10,798.3 jin of soybeans per hectare on 5.08 hectares of land. The high-yield soybeans in this cooperative are characterized by many branches, dense pods, and uniform distribution of soybean plants. There are 190,000 soybean seedlings per hectare, with each plant having an average of about seventy pods and about one hundred and eighty grains.

    据新华社福州电　福建省海澄县莲花乡黎明农业社今年种植的七千七百三十五亩水稻，每亩平均早晚两季共收获干谷一千四百五十五斤，比去年增产四成以上。这样大面积的丰产成绩，还是很少见的。
    全社农业、畜牧、果园、养鱼等收入一起计算，每个劳动日可以分到两元。从预分结果看，全社有91.9％户社员收入增加。
