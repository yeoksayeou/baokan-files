To Greet the Coming High Tide of Hog Raising and Manure Accumulation Next Year, All Localities Must Vigorously Develop Piglet Production

    The Urban Services Department and the Ministry of Agriculture jointly issued instructions today on developing piglet production.

    The instructions first made a relatively brief analysis of the development trend of hog production, explaining that after the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward a series of measures for developing hog production, it is estimated that agricultural producers' cooperatives in various localities will experience a high tide of hog raising and manure accumulation next year. Under this circumstance, all localities will encounter difficulties such as insufficient supply of piglets and rising prices. This problem must be solved by vigorously developing piglet production, adopting the principle of mainly local breeding and supplemented by external transfer.

    Based on this situation and principle, the instructions put forward specific practices: First, the total number of sows in the country now is not adapted to the requirements for developing hog production next year. Therefore, all localities should, according to actual conditions and the needs of developing hog production, increase the retention of boars and sows in a certain proportion, and should promote superior breeds, implement double mating and repeated mating methods to increase the sow reproduction rate. At the same time, farmers should be guided to strengthen the feeding management of boars, sows, and piglets to improve the survival rate of piglets. Second, it is necessary to ensure that agricultural cooperatives and farmers raising pigs have a certain profit. This should be done by appropriately setting the price of piglets. In the case of a shortage of piglets, it is necessary to set the piglet price slightly higher to stimulate hog production, but excessively high prices will increase the cost of hog raising, which is not conducive to the development of hog production. Therefore, all localities must consult with the masses to formulate prices based on local historical conditions and the cost of piglets. In addition, the difficulty of feeding sows should be properly resolved. Third, local food companies and supply and marketing cooperatives should actively engage in the operation of piglets, be responsible for the transfer of piglets between regions, and should also actively utilize small merchants and peddlers to transport piglets and enable small merchants and peddlers to obtain a certain profit.

    Since the development of piglet production must be combined with the entire hog production plan and agricultural production plan to make plans for raising boars and sows, the problem of pig sources can be solved and the realization of the hog production plan can be guaranteed. Therefore, the instructions require all provinces and regions to make arrangements for the production of piglets in the near future and should submit them to the party and government leading organs for approval and unified issuance.

### 迎接明年养猪积肥高潮  各地要大力发展仔猪生产

    迎接明年养猪积肥高潮
    各地要大力发展仔猪生产
    新华社21日讯　城市服务部、农业部于今天联合发出关于发展仔猪生产的指示。
    指示首先对于生猪生产的发展趋势作了比较简要的分析，说明在中共中央二中全会对于发展生猪生产提出了一系列的措施后，估计明年各地农业生产合作社将会出现养猪积肥的高潮。在这个情况下，各地都会遇到仔猪供应不足，价格上涨等困难，这一问题必须大力发展仔猪生产，采取以就地繁殖为主，外地调剂为辅的方针加以解决。
    指示根据这个情况和方针提出具体的做法是：一、现在全国的母猪总数与明年发展生猪生产的要求是不适应的，因此各地都应当根据实际情况和发展生猪生产的需要，按一定的比例增留公、母猪，并且应当推广优良品种，推行双重交配和复配的办法，提高母猪繁殖率，同时还应当指导农民加强对公、母猪和仔猪的饲养管理，以提高仔猪的成活率。二、必须作到使饲养猪的农业社和农户有一定的利润，这就应该适当的定出仔猪价格。在仔猪供不应求的情况下，仔猪价格稍高一些，以刺激生猪生产是必要的，但价格过高了也会增加养猪的成本，对于发展生猪生产是不利的。因此各地必须根据当地历史情况和仔猪成本，同群众协商拟定。此外，还应妥善的解决母猪的饲料困难。三、各地食品公司和供销合作社，应该积极的经营仔猪，负责地区之间的仔猪调剂，同时还应当积极地利用小商小贩贩运仔猪，并且使小商小贩能够得到一定的利润。
    由于发展仔猪生产必须与整个发展生猪生产规划和农业生产规划结合起来，作出饲养公、母猪的计划，才可以解决猪源问题，保证生猪生产规划的实现。因此指示要求各省、区在最近对于发展仔猪的生产作一安排，并且应当请党政领导机关批示后统一下达。
