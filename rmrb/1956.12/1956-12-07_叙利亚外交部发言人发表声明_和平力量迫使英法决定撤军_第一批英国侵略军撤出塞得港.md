    Syrian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Issues Statement
    Forces of Peace Compel Britain and France to Decide to Withdraw Troops
    First Batch of British Aggressor Troops Withdraws from Port Said
    Xinhua News Agency, December 6th—Port Said News: The first batch of British troops, numbering more than 1,800, forced to withdraw from Egyptian territory, left Port Said today aboard the troop transport ship "Dilwara" to return home.
    On December 5th, Egyptian residents of Port Said gathered in the streets to mock the British troops marching onto the ships. People plastered Nasser's portraits all over the city walls.
    Xinhua News Agency, December 6th—According to TASS, Damascus, December 6th: A Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesperson issued a statement regarding Britain and France being forced to decide to withdraw their troops from Egypt, saying that although Britain and France have agreed to withdraw their troops from Egypt, the imperialists have not abandoned their aggressive intentions and therefore vigilance should not be relaxed.
    The spokesperson said that British Foreign Secretary Lloyd's speech in the House of Commons on December 3rd signified official recognition that the British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt had failed.
    He pointed out that the strong resistance of the Arab countries and their unity, as well as world public opinion's support for the Arab peoples, were the fundamental factors that led to the failure of the imperialist aggression. He said: "This support proves that it is more powerful than the bombs and other war tools possessed by the aggressors."
    The spokesperson emphasized that the Soviet Union's warning to the aggressor countries was a decisive factor in forcing them to cease fire. He said that the Soviet Union has once again demonstrated in this struggle that it is a true friend of the Arabs and a true defender of the principles of the United Nations.
    He also said that the aggression against Egypt showed that Israel played the role of an imperialist running dog.
    The spokesperson pointed out that after the failure of the imperialist forces' aggression against Egypt, they began to provoke Syria. However, Syria exposed their slander against Syria and made the true intentions of the aggressors clear to the world public.

    叙利亚外交部发言人发表声明
    和平力量迫使英法决定撤军
    第一批英国侵略军撤出塞得港
    新华社6日讯　塞得港消息：被迫撤离埃及领土的首批英国军队一千八百多人今天乘“迪尔瓦腊号”运兵船离开塞得港回国。
    12月5日，塞得港的埃及居民拥集在街道上嘲笑列队上船的英国军队。人们把纳赛尔的肖像贴遍在全城的墙上。
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社大马士革6日讯：叙利亚外交部发言人就英法被迫决定从埃及撤军一事发表声明说，尽管英国和法国同意把军队撤出埃及，帝国主义者还没有放弃他们的侵略意图，因此不应该放松警惕。
    这个发言人说，英国外交大臣劳埃德12月3日在下院的那篇讲话意味着正式承认英国同法国和以色列对埃及进行的侵略已经失败。
    他指出，阿拉伯国家的坚强反抗和它们的团结以及世界舆论对阿拉伯各国人民的支持是使得帝国主义侵略遭到失败的基本因素。他说：“这种支持证明，它比侵略者所拥有的炸弹和其他战争工具要有力。”
    这位发言人着重指出，苏联向侵略国提出的警告是迫使它们停火的一个决定性因素。他说，苏联在这个斗争中又一次表明，它是阿拉伯人的真正朋友，是联合国原则的真正的维护者。
    他还说，对埃及的侵略表明，以色列充当了帝国主义走狗的角色。
    发言人指出，帝国主义势力在侵略埃及失败之后，又开始对叙利亚进行挑衅。但是，叙利亚揭穿了他们对叙利亚所发动的诽谤，向全世界公众说明了侵略者的真正意图。
