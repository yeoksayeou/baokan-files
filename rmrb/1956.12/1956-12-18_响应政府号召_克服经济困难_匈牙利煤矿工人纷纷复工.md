Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 17th: Nearly 35,000 people were working in coal mines across Hungary on December 14th, an increase of 15,000 from the previous day. On that day, 18,150 tons of coal were mined. (Editor's note: According to statistics, Hungary's coal production in 1955 was 22.3 million tons, with an average daily output of about 60,000 tons.)

Currently, increasing coal production is one of the important conditions for restoring normal industrial production. Workers in many enterprises across the country have expressed their willingness to help miners increase coal production. On the other hand, fraternal countries are also supplying Hungary with large quantities of coal. The Soviet Union supplies it with 8,000 to 10,000 tons of coal every day, Bulgaria supplies it with 100,000 tons of coal every month, Poland will supply it with 40,000 tons of coal in December, and Czechoslovakia is preparing to supply it with 50,000 tons of coal this month.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 15th: "People's Free Press" published the工农革命政府 Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government's appeal to the miners on the 14th, calling on them to unite and actively restore coal mine production.

The appeal stated that Hungary's economic situation is currently very serious. Thanks to the government's efforts, residents have not yet felt the impact of economic difficulties too much, and things can still be bought at the original prices in state-owned stores. However, this situation cannot be maintained for long. Warehouses are running out, foreign aid can only temporarily alleviate the difficulties, and the threat of inflation is getting closer and closer. However, it is still possible to stop it.

Most of the workers have seen the danger of inflation and are willing to work. The reasons hindering them from working are partly due to the provocations of counter-revolutionaries, but mainly due to the lack of coal.

The appeal stated that in this historically significant period, we must first rely on the miners to lead the suffering people to the road to prosperity. The appeal calls on miners who have retired on pensions to go to work as long as their health and other conditions permit. All those who have been miners in the past should also return to the mines. The appeal pointed out that the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government has announced a significant increase in miners' wages. The government has also decided that miners who were working before October 23rd and can resume work before December 15th will also receive a loyalty bonus on December 22nd. Miners who have worked in the mines for more than three years can obtain national loans and building materials to build their own houses. Retired miners who rejoin the workforce will continue to receive their pensions in addition to their wages.

    响应政府号召　克服经济困难
    匈牙利煤矿工人纷纷复工
    据新华社布达佩斯17日电　匈牙利各地煤矿中在12月14日将近有三万五千人工作，比前一天增加了一万五千人。这一天开采的煤达到一万八千一百五十吨。（编者注　根据统计，1955年匈牙利的煤产量是二千二百三十万吨，平均日产量是六万吨左右。）
    目前，增加煤的产量是使工业生产全部恢复正常的重要条件之一。全国许多企业的工人表示愿意帮助矿工增加采煤量。另一方面，兄弟国家也供给匈牙利以大量的煤。苏联每天供给它八千吨到一万吨煤，保加利亚每月供给它十万吨煤，波兰在12月份将供给它四万吨煤，捷克斯洛伐克在这个月预备供应它五万吨煤。
    据新华社布达佩斯15日电“人民自由报”14日登载了工农革命政府对矿工们的号召书，号召他们团结起来积极恢复煤矿的生产。
    号召书说，目前匈牙利的经济情况很严重。由于政府的努力，居民至今还没有怎么感觉到经济困难的影响，在国营商店中还可以按原来的价格买到东西。但是，这种情况是维持不了多久的，仓库快空了，外国的援助只能暂时缓和困难，通货膨胀的威胁愈来愈近了，可是目前还来得及制止它。
    工人们大多数看到了通货膨胀的危险，愿意工作。妨碍他们工作的原因一部分是由于反革命分子的挑衅，但是主要还是由于缺乏煤。
    号召书说，在这个具有历史意义的时期里，首先要依靠矿工们来使受难的人民走向繁荣的道路。号召书号召已经退休养老的矿工们只要健康和其他情况允许就去上工。凡是在过去曾当过矿工的人们也都回到矿上去。号召书指出，工农革命政府已经宣布大大提高矿工的工资。政府还决定，凡是10月23日以前就做工的矿工而能在12月15日前恢复上班的，12月22日还可以得到忠诚工作奖金，凡在矿井中工作三年以上的矿工，可以得到国家贷款和建筑材料来为自己建筑住宅。凡退休养老的矿工在重新参加工作以后，他们除了得到工资以外还照旧领养老金。
