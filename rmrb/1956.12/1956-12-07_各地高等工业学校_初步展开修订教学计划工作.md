Higher industrial schools across the country
　　Initially Begin Revising Teaching Plans

　　(Our Newspaper News) The Ministry of Higher Education deployed the work of revising the teaching plans of higher industrial schools at the end of September this year. The purpose of this work is not only to overcome the shortcomings in the past teaching plans, thereby further improving teaching work, reducing students' learning burden, and strengthening the cultivation of students' independent working ability, but also to summarize the experience of teaching reform in recent years and better learn from all useful knowledge of China's past and foreign countries, so that higher education work can be more in line with China's actual situation and more suitable for the needs of socialist construction.

　　Higher industrial schools, especially those entrusted to revise the teaching plans of typical majors, have successively launched discussions. Many engineers in business departments have also put forward their opinions.

　　First of all, regarding the question of whether higher industrial schools can train engineers, some people believe that it is inappropriate to grant the title of engineer to four-year and five-year graduates, because in reality, graduates need at least two or three years of training before they can take on the responsibilities of an engineer. Another opinion is that although higher industrial schools cannot train engineers who can immediately be competent for their work, graduates already possess the necessary knowledge and skills, and it is appropriate to give them the title of engineer.

　　On the important issues of major division and business scope, there are roughly three different views. The first view affirms that the Soviet method of training talents by major is the world's advanced experience and is our main direction of learning. The majors currently set up in higher industrial schools also have some that are not suitable for China's needs, but can only be appropriately adjusted on the existing basis. This is further divided into two opinions: the first faction advocates that the division can still be narrower, dividing the existing majors into two or more majors. The other faction believes that existing majors should generally not be subdivided further, and some specializations can even be merged or cancelled.

　　The second view believes that the existing division of majors and business scope is too detailed and should be boldly merged or cancelled. The reason is that merging facilitates the cultivation of technical talents with "good foundation and broad horizons," which is conducive to the growth of scientific cadres.

　　The third view advocates setting up both majors with a wider business scope and majors with a narrower business scope. The former cultivates talents with a more solid foundation and slightly weaker professional knowledge, while the latter cultivates talents with deeper professional knowledge and a weaker foundation. The coexistence of the two is beneficial for adapting to the urgent needs of national industrial construction and the long-term interests of cadre growth.

　　The proportion of basic theoretical knowledge to professional technical knowledge is also a topic that everyone is keen to debate. Whether teachers or technicians, they all agree that students should be given a solid foundation in school and taught a certain amount of professional knowledge, but first and foremost, basic theory should be learned well. Because science and technology are developing rapidly, it is impossible to learn everything in advance in school. As long as a solid foundation is laid, professional knowledge can be gradually mastered in production practice. At the same time, if students' basic theory is not solid, even if they learn more professional knowledge, once they have to switch to other jobs due to the development of the situation or the progress of science and technology, they will not be able to quickly adapt to the needs of the job. However, everyone's understanding of the content of "foundation" is not consistent, and there are some disputes.

　　Because this work is related to the quality of cadre training in the future, the Ministry of Higher Education has sent letters to the business departments, requesting them to organize forces to cooperate in revising the teaching plans and conduct investigations and research.

### 各地高等工业学校　初步展开修订教学计划工作

    各地高等工业学校
　　初步展开修订教学计划工作
    本报讯　高等教育部在今年9月底布置了高等工业学校修订教学计划的工作。这一工作的目的不仅在于由此入手克服过去教学计划中的缺点以进一步提高和改进教学工作、减轻学生学习负担、加强培养学生独立工作能力，同时在于就此总结几年来教学改革的经验，更好地学习中国过去和外国的一切有益的知识，以使高等教育工作更加切合我国实际，更加适合社会主义建设需要。
    各高等工业学校，特别是被委托修订典型专业教学计划的学校，都已先后展开了讨论。业务部门中很多工程师也提出了意见。
    首先是关于高等工业学校能否培养出工程师的问题，有些人认为四年制和五年制的毕业生即授予工程师的称号是不妥当的，因为实际上毕业生至少要经过两三年的锻炼后才能负起工程师的责任。另一种意见认为高等工业学校虽不能培养出立即胜任工作的工程师，但毕业生已经具备了必要的知识和技能，给予工程师的称号还是恰当的。
    在专业划分和业务范围这一重要问题上，也大体上存在着三种不同的看法。第一种意见肯定苏联按专业培养人才的办法是世界上先进的经验，是我们学习的主要方向。现在高等工业学校所设置的专业，也有不适合中国需要的，但只能在现有基础上进行适当的调整。这又分为两派意见：第一派主张仍可以划分再窄一些，将现设专业分为两个或更多的专业。另一派认为现有专业一般不应再分细，有些专门化还可以合并或取消。
    第二种意见认为现有的专业和业务范围划分过细，应当大胆地进行合并或取消。理由是合并后便于培养“基础好、眼界广”的技术人才，有利于科学干部的成长。
    第三种意见主张同时设置业务范围较宽的专业和业务范围较窄的专业。前者培养的人才基础较坚实，专业知识差些，后者培养的人才专业知识较深、基础较薄弱些。二者同时并存，对适应国家工业建设的急迫需要以及干部成长的长远利益来讲，是有利的。
    基础理论知识同专业技术知识的比重问题，也是大家所热心争论的。无论教师或技术人员都一致认为在学校中应给学生打好基础，并授予一定的专业知识，但首先应学好基础理论。因为科学技术发展很快，在学校中不可能预先都学好，只要打好了基础，专业知识是可以在生产实践中逐步掌握的；同时，学生基础理论如不坚实，专业知识即使多学了些，一旦由于形势的发展或是由于科学技术的进步不得不转做其他工作时，就不能迅速地适应工作需要。但是，大家对“基础”的内容的了解不一致，有些争论。
    由于这一工作关系到今后培养干部的质量问题，高等教育部已经函请各业务部门组织力量配合修订教学计划，进行调查研究。
