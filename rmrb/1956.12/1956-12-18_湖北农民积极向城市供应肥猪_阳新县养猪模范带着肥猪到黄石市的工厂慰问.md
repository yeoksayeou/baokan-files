Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 16th: As the New Year approaches, farmers in various parts of Hubei Province are actively selling batches of fat pigs to supply the people of cities and industrial and mining areas for consumption.

    Recently, more than 20 agricultural cooperative directors and pig-raising models from Yangxin County organized a condolence group and took more than 300 large fat pigs sold by farmers throughout the county to the nearby industrial city of Huangshi for condolences. When Luo Jincheng, a provincial pig-raising model, personally delivered a large fat pig weighing 800 jin that he had raised to a factory, the workers warmly welcomed him. During the visit and tour of many large factories, the workers specially gave the condolence group 1,800 jin of bean cakes for fertilizing the fields. Recently, Macheng County also selected representatives to send 600 fat pigs to Wuhan City, expressing the feelings of the county's farmers towards the people of Wuhan City. After hearing the news that local departments called for the sale of fat pigs, farmers in Laifeng County sold more than 700 fat pigs in less than a week.

    Food companies, transportation departments, and other departments in various parts of the province are doing their best to transport the fat pigs sold by farmers as soon as they arrive.

    阳新县养猪模范带着肥猪到黄石市的工厂慰问
    新华社武汉16日电　新年即将到来，湖北省各地农民正在积极出售成批肥猪，供给城市和工矿地区人民食用。
    阳新县二十多个农业社主任和养猪模范最近组织慰问团，带着全县农民出售的三百多口大肥猪，乘车到附近的工业城市黄石市去进行慰问。当全省养猪模范罗金成亲自把养大的重达八百斤的大肥猪送到工厂时，工人们对他表示了热烈的欢迎。这个慰问团在访问和参观许多大工厂期间，工人们特地送给他们一千八百斤肥田用的豆饼。麻城县最近也选派代表，将六百口肥猪送到武汉市，表示全县农民对武汉市人民的心意。来凤县农民听到当地有关部门号召出售肥猪的消息后，不到一个星期，就出售肥猪七百多口。
    全省各地的食品公司、交通运输等部门对农民出售的肥猪都尽量做到随到随运。
