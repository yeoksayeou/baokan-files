Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 6th: The General Office of the Hubei Provincial People's Committee streamlined its personnel and improved work efficiency.

    The streamlining work of the General Office was carried out with the personal participation of the Governor, Deputy Governors, and Secretary-General of Hubei Province. As early as October this year, Governor Zhang Tixue gave a mobilization report to the cadres of the General Office. Afterwards, two reorganization plans proposed by the provincial leaders, party branches, and heads of various sections were submitted to the cadres and masses for discussion. After repeated research and comparison, and based on the actual work needs, the number of cadres in the entire office was reduced from sixty-four to thirty-six.

    After the reorganization, the General Office had fewer personnel and a more streamlined structure, which improved the enthusiasm of the cadres. Heads of various sections changed their past style of only "grasping the overall situation and floating on the surface." Now, in addition to grasping the overall work, they also undertake a specific business task. The work of each section was rearranged according to the abilities of the existing cadres. The two accountants in the General Affairs Section, in addition to undertaking the work of the previous three people, also used their spare time during the "three busy" periods (busy with budgeting at the beginning of the month, busy with paying salaries in the middle of the month, and busy with final accounting at the end of the month) to also manage the safekeeping work that was previously done by three full-time cadres. Although the business of the Document Printing and Dispatch Section expanded after the reorganization, it did not increase personnel. In addition to the business of the General Office itself, it also combined the document printing and dispatch work of the Provincial People's Committee's offices for culture and education, finance and trade, and agriculture, forestry, and water, saving manpower.

    Secondly, according to the opinions of the masses, the internal structure was adjusted, the procedures were reduced, and the handling of affairs became more flexible and rapid. Previously, for important letters and visits from the people to the People's Letters Section, which belonged to the Secretariat, the process involved the reception room, the Letters Section, the section chief, and then the leaders of the Secretariat. This artificially created an obstacle to contact between the leaders and the people. Now, the People's Letters Section has been adjusted to a section directly under the General Office, and the reception room has been abolished, reducing several procedures. Anyone who comes to write letters or visit can directly inquire about things at the People's Letters Section, or talk directly to the section chief.

    Gao Baozhao, the head of the Personnel Section of the Provincial General Office, told reporters: "Here, the phenomenon of reading newspapers and chatting during work hours and the depressed mood of cadres, which were caused by too many people and too little work and idle labor, can no longer be seen. The cadres who were transferred out due to the streamlining have all happily taken on new jobs one after another."

### 湖北省人民委员会办公厅  大刀阔斧精简人员

    湖北省人民委员会办公厅
    大刀阔斧精简人员
    新华社武汉6日电　湖北省人民委员会办公厅精简人员编制，提高了工作效率。
    办公厅的精简工作是在湖北省省长、副省长和秘书长亲自参与下进行的。早在今年10月间，省长张体学就对这个办公厅的干部作了动员报告，以后把省的负责人和党支部、各科室负责人分别提出的两个整编方案交给干部群众讨论。经过再三研究和对比，根据实际工作需要，把全厅干部由六十四个减为三十六个。
    整编后的办公厅，人员减少，机构精练，干部的积极性有了提高。各科室负责人改变了过去只“掌握全盘，浮在上面”的作风，现在他们除掌握全面工作外，还作一项具体业务工作。各科室的工作都根据现有干部能力重新作了安排，总务科的两个会计，除了担负以前三个人的工作外，还利用“三忙”
  （月初预算忙、月中发薪忙、月底决算忙）的空闲时间，兼管过去由三个专职干部作的保管工作。文印收发科整编后虽然业务扩大了，却没有增加人，除办公厅本身业务外，还把省人民委员会文教、财粮贸、农林水等三个办公室的文印、收发工作归并在一起办理，节省了人力。
    其次，根据群众的意见，调整了内部机构，减少了办事手续，办事也较灵活迅速。原来属于秘书处的人民来信科，一个重要的人民来信来访，要经过接待室、来信科、科长再到秘书处的领导人，这就人为地造成了领导人员和人民群众的接触的障碍。现在，人民来信科已调整为办公厅直属科，把接待室取消了，减少了好几道手续，只要有人来信来访就能直接到人民来信科询问事情，或找科长直接谈问题。
    省办公厅人事科长高保照对记者说：这里，过去那种由于人多事少、劳力闲置所造成的上班时看报聊天、干部情绪沉闷等现象，现在再也看不见了。由于精简而调出的干部都愉快地先后走上了新的工作岗位。
