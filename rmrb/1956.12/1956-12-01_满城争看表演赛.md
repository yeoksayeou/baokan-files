　　The Whole City Eagerly Watches the Exhibition Match
　　Guo An
    When the Shanghai newspapers published the news that the Chinese Olympic Sports Delegation would come to Shanghai for exhibition matches, it immediately caused a sensation throughout Shanghai. Provinces such as Inner Mongolia, Hunan, and Shanxi organized visiting groups from afar to learn from the national team.
    The enthusiasm of the Shanghai people in welcoming the Olympic Sports Delegation was unprecedented. Every evening, the area around the Municipal Gymnasium was packed. Those spectators who did not get tickets waited at the entrance, content just to catch a glimpse of the national team athletes. The large bus carrying the athletes was often surrounded by enthusiastic spectators. After the matches, the audience was reluctant to leave, waving to the athletes.
    The Chinese Olympic Sports Delegation received such a warm welcome in Shanghai, not only because, as the Shanghai people said, "How could we not watch the national team representing our country in the Olympic Games?", but also because many of the outstanding athletes in the delegation, such as Fu Xueyan, who set a national women's high jump record, Liu Erzhu, a basketball player from a working-class background, and Zhang Honggen, Fang Renqiu, and Chen Chengda, all outstanding players in the football team, were formerly workers and students from Shanghai.
    During the three days of exhibition matches, the outstanding athletes of the national team did not disappoint the expectations and love of the people of the whole country and the people of Shanghai. In the exhibition match between the national track and field team and outstanding athletes from various regions on the 28th, despite the relatively cold weather and the fact that there had been too many matches and too little practice recently, ten events, fourteen individuals, and one team broke the national records in thirteen track and field events. Shi Baozhu, a female discus thrower who has entered the ranks of world-class athletes, although she had the shortcomings of less practice and throwing the discus too early in the competition, all three throws were out of bounds, but her score still reached 46.89 meters (she had previously set a record of 50.93 meters in Wuhan). This score has exceeded the sixth place in this Olympic Games (46.73 meters). The women's 4x100 meter relay broke the national record with a time of 48.4 seconds, creating the highest national score. In addition, men's javelin, 110-meter hurdles, high jump and women's 80-meter hurdles, etc. all broke national records.
    The national basketball team's skills in the two basketball exhibition matches in three days shocked the Shanghai basketball community. In the first game against the Shanghai Mixed Team, the national team showed fast breakthroughs, accurate shooting, and varied tactics, easily defeating the Shanghai Mixed Team with an overwhelming score of 141 to 57. In the game against the joint team of the Navy and Air Force on the 28th, the national team's defensive methods were particularly successful in the face of the opponent's fast offense and accurate mid-range jump shots. In the two games, nearly three hundred points were scored. Every member of the national basketball team has become well-known to the Shanghai audience.
    Gymnastics is also a relatively common sport in Shanghai, and the Shanghai audience has a high level of appreciation for various gymnastic events. During the performance on the 27th, a burst of thunderous applause often erupted in the audience.
    The football exhibition match on the 28th was also warmly welcomed by the Shanghai audience. Although the Shanghai team also tried to attack and defend, and approached the national team's goal several times, almost kicking the ball in, the Shanghai team's goal was full of danger throughout the game. The national team scored three goals and won with a score of three to zero.
    The performance of the Chinese Olympic Sports Delegation in the past three days has been good. Although we did not participate in this competition due to the Olympic Committee's "Two Chinas" conspiracy, the achievements of the Chinese Olympic Sports Delegation in the two exhibition matches in Wuhan and Shanghai are indelible by those conspirators!

　　满城争看表演赛
　　国安
    当上海各报刊登了中国奥林匹克体育代表团来上海作表演比赛的消息的时候，顿时轰动了全上海。内蒙古、湖南、山西等省都组织了参观团远道来向国家队学习。
    上海人民欢迎奥林匹克体育代表团的热情是空前的。每天晚上，市体育馆的周围挤得水泄不通。那些没有买到票的观众等在门口只求能看到国家队运动员一眼便很满足了。运动员坐的大汽车经常被热情的观众包围。比赛完毕，观众们还迟迟不肯退去，向运动员挥手致意。
    中国奥林匹克体育代表团在上海受到这样热情的欢迎，除了像上海人民所说的：代表我们国家参加奥林匹克比赛的国家队哪能不看一下的原因以外，还因为代表团中不少的优秀运动员像创造全国女子跳高纪录的傅雪雁、工人出身的篮球运动员刘二柱、足球队中的好手张宏根、方纫秋、陈成达等，过去都是上海的工人和学生。
    在三天的表演比赛中，国家队的优秀运动员没有辜负全国人民和上海人民的期望和热爱。在28日的国家田径队和各地优秀运动员的表演比赛中，尽管由于天气比较寒冷、最近一个时期比赛过多练习少，但在十三项田径比赛中，仍有十个项目、十四人和一个队打破了全国最高纪录。已进入世界优秀的女子铁饼选手行列的石宝珠，在比赛中虽然因练习较少和铁饼出手过早的缺点，三次投掷都出了界外，但她的成绩还是达到了四十六公尺八十九公分（在武汉时曾创造了五十公尺九十三公分的成绩）。这个成绩已超过本届奥林匹克运动会的第六名
  （四十六公尺七十三公分）。女子四百公尺接力以四十八秒四的成绩打破了全国纪录，创造了全国最高成绩。此外像男子标枪、一百十公尺高栏、跳高和女子八十公尺低栏等都打破了全国纪录。
    国家篮球队的技术在三天中的两场篮球表演比赛中，震动了上海的篮球界。在第一天对上海混合队的比赛中，国家队表现出快速的突破、准确的投篮和变化多端的战术，以一百四十一比五十七的压倒比数轻取了上海混合队。在28日对海军和空军组成的联队比赛时，国家队在对方快速进攻和准确的中距离跃起投篮下，防守方法显得特别成功。两场比赛，得了几近三百分。国家篮球队的每个队员都成为上海观众所熟知的了。
    竞技体操在上海也是一项比较普遍的运动，上海市的观众对体操各个项目的欣赏水平也很高。在27日的表演中，观众席上经常爆发出一阵暴雷般的掌声。
    28日的足球表演比赛也受到了上海观众的热烈欢迎。虽然上海队也努力进攻、防守，有几次逼近国家队的大门几乎将球踢进，但在整场比赛中，上海队门前险象百出。国家队攻进了三个球，以三比零取得了胜利。
    三天来的中国奥林匹克体育代表团的表演比赛成绩是良好的，虽然由于奥委会的“两个中国”的阴谋而使我们没有参加这次比赛，但是中国奥林匹克体育代表团在武汉、上海的两次表演比赛取得的成绩却是那些阴谋家无法抹煞的！
