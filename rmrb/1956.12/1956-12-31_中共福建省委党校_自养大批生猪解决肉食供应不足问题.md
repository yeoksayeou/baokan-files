    CCP Fujian Provincial Party School
    Raises Large Numbers of Pigs to Solve Meat Supply Shortages
    (Our Correspondent in Fujian reports) The CCP Fujian Provincial Party School is raising large numbers of pigs in order to solve the problem of insufficient pork supply. Recently, the person in charge of the school's administrative section told reporters that from January of this year to now, they have slaughtered more than 120 self-raised pigs, yielding approximately 18,000 catties of pork. The school's more than 1,200 students and staff, during the period of the lowest pork supply in the Fuzhou market in September and October this year, could still eat an average of about one liang of meat per person per day. Currently, in addition to more than 30% of the pork still needing to be supplied by the market, the rest can be solved by themselves.
    There is a lot of open space around the Party School, which can be used to build pigsties and plant feed. At the same time, the cafeteria also has bean dregs from making soy milk, leftover food scraps, and rice water, which can be used as feed for the pigs. Taking advantage of these favorable conditions, the cafeteria started raising a sow and several piglets in 1951, and after gradual breeding and expansion, in addition to slaughtering one or two heads per week, they still have 91 pigs, each of which is raised very fat. One of them even weighed 350 or 360 catties.
    These pigs are raised by two cooks who are responsible for their care. They are very careful in raising the pigs and often pay attention to epidemic prevention and hygiene. Therefore, the mortality rate of the pigs is very low. In order to ensure that the pigs have an ample supply of feed, in addition to buying some rotten vegetable leaves from the vegetable market, they also planted pumpkins on the nearby slopes, harvesting more than 2,000 catties, all of which are used to feed the pigs.
    Recently, in order to enable students to eat more pork, the cafeteria specially held a meeting and formulated a plan to increase pig raising. By March and April next year, the number of pigs raised can be increased to 130 or 140. By the beginning of 1958, the pork can be self-sufficient and no longer rely on market supply. (Photo attached)

### 中共福建省委党校  自养大批生猪解决肉食供应不足问题

    中共福建省委党校
    自养大批生猪解决肉食供应不足问题
    本报讯　驻福建记者报道：中共福建省委党校自养大批生猪，以求解决猪肉供应不足问题。最近，这个学校的行政科负责人曾对记者说，从今年1月份到现在，他们已宰杀了自养猪一百二十多头，约有猪肉一万八千多斤。全校一千二百多个学员和职工，在今年9、10月间福州市场上猪肉供应最少的时期，每人每天平均还可以吃肉一两左右。目前，除30％以上的猪肉仍需市场上供应外，其余都可以自行解决。
    党校周围空地很多，可以修建猪圈和种植饲料。同时，食堂里也有自己做豆浆的豆腐渣和不少残羹剩菜及米水等，可以作饲料喂猪。这个食堂利用这些有利条件，从1951年开始喂养一头母猪和几头小猪起，并经过逐年繁殖增加，除每星期宰杀一头到二头外，到现在仍有九十一头猪，每头都养得很肥大。其中有一头曾养到三百五、六十斤重。
    这些生猪，是由二个炊事员专责饲养的。他们对养猪很细心，还经常注意防疫卫生。因此，猪的死亡率很低。为了使生猪有充裕的饲料，今年他们除向菜市场买了一些烂菜皮外，还在附近的坡地上种植了南瓜，已收了二千多斤，都用来喂猪。
    最近，食堂为了使学员能吃到更多的猪肉，专门召开会议，作出增养生猪的规划。到明年3、4月间，生猪可增养到一百三、四十头。到1958年初，猪肉即可自给，不再依靠市场供应。（附图片）
