Budapest Dispatch:

    Struggle in a Dark Corner
    By Our Correspondent Hu Jibang
    On December 9th, the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government announced two decrees: one to organize military tribunals and set a time limit for counter-revolutionary elements to surrender their weapons; the other to dissolve the city, district, and state workers' councils, retaining only the workers' councils within enterprises.
    These are resolute steps taken by the revolutionary forces to attack the enemy. About a month ago, some workers at the Budapest Chemical Instrument Factory suggested similar measures to the government. During this period, government leaders repeatedly received representatives of workers' councils from various regions (some of whom were reactionary elements who had usurped leadership positions), patiently explaining to them that strikes and work stoppages should not be used as weapons to negotiate with the government, as they would bring enormous losses to the country and the workers themselves. Honest workers were quick to understand this sincere language, but those counter-revolutionary elements determined to be enemies of the revolutionary regime refused to abandon their attempts. On the 11th, some workers' councils incited a forty-eight-hour strike to protest the aforementioned two decrees. At the same time, several members of the Budapest Central Workers' Council issued a statement to the radio station declaring their disapproval of the strike and denouncing this sinister incitement.
    On the 12th, I went to an area on the Buda side of the Danube, west of the river, where counter-revolutionary elements were relatively rampant, to understand the situation. According to the district party secretary, there were more than sixty enterprises in this district, but the workers mostly lived in the suburbs, their lives scattered, making it difficult to conduct education on weekdays. The residents of this district included many former soldiers, senior intellectuals, and members of the petty bourgeoisie from the Horthy era. The political situation was complex, and party building was also relatively difficult.
    The Beloyannis Factory, which manufactures telecommunications equipment, is the largest factory in this district and was formerly owned by British and American capital. The workers' council of this factory was the center of counter-revolutionary activities in this district and even in the city. The chairman of the now-dissolved Budapest Central Workers' Council was a worker from this factory named Sandor Racz, only twenty-two years old. It is said that fascist organizations used two truckloads of armed forces to ensure his election, and he has been acting under the instructions of his fascist masters ever since. On December 5th, counter-revolutionary elements from various workers' councils in this district gathered to discuss launching another armed rebellion, but it did not materialize.
    Sandor Racz, using the name of the Budapest Central Workers' Council, organized secret national meetings in the past few days, inciting the overthrow of the government. Disregarding the opposition of honest workers and technicians, he called for a provocative general strike of forty-eight hours. He maintained frequent contact with "Radio Free Europe" and Western newspaper reporters. It is said that he was arrested yesterday (the 11th).
    In this factory dominated by dark forces, a Party organization has finally been established. Another factory, United Harvesters, which has manufactured many orders for our country, has completely turned around. The chairman of the workers' council is now a Party member, and the workers of this factory did not respond to the two-day strike.
    On the 11th, streetcars in this district were running as usual, but bandits boarded the cars and tied up a driver with rope, preventing him from moving forward. Passengers protested, and the police quickly arrived and arrested the thugs.
    Buses did not run for two days, and some workers did not go to work because they lived far away and had no transportation, but some still walked to the factory.
    The district committee seemed to have just finished a meeting. Some people and some smoke remained in the office. A middle-aged worker was stuffing a bundle of newly printed leaflets into his briefcase and promised to distribute them at dawn tomorrow. At this time, the district committee secretary introduced him to me, saying that he was a driver from the city's public transportation company named Dokatch, and he could talk to you about the situation there. Dokatch went on to say that the public transportation company is not a production unit and should not organize a workers' council according to government regulations, but the workers' council was still organized. After the recent re-election of the provisional workers' council, it is still being manipulated by bad elements because the workers are still somewhat paralyzed, there are few Communists, and the past Party leaders have been removed. He himself is a Party member, but his vigilance was not high enough. During the last election of the provisional workers' council, he also supported the son of a large landowner to be the chairman. When he later realized it, this provisional chairman had fled to Austria.
    This time, the workers' council announced a strike without consulting the workers. He asked them whether this was democracy or autocracy? The bad elements responded with threats, saying that they would settle accounts with him.
    As we were talking, a series of clear gunshots suddenly rang out outside. The comrades of the district committee immediately took out their pistols from their briefcases and walked towards the window. I was also curious and walked to the window to see the situation outside, but there were no signs of thugs attacking the street. The person sent to find out the situation returned and reported that a suspicious crowd had gathered in the square next to the street, trying to stop the streetcar from running. Later, many Hungarian military police arrived, fired shots into the sky, and dispersed the crowd. A cold shot was fired from the window of a house. The police immediately went in to search and may have arrested some people. The district committee secretary said: "The enemy has been taking advantage of our humanitarianism. Now we can no longer use peaceful language but should attack them with force. If we show strength, the residents will also stand firmly and draw a clear line with the enemy. The change in the attitude of the residents has been seen in the past few days." He also said that the young man who just walked out forgot to introduce himself to you. His name is Blazek, and he is a worker in the cable factory. His father is an old Communist. Recently, he applied to join the Party and was approved. Among the young workers in the factory, he worked hard to carry out propaganda. Today he came to the district committee and said that he could no longer tolerate the rampant behavior of counter-revolutionaries and asked to go to the place where the country needs him most: to join the Public Security Forces. The district committee supported his wish and wrote him a letter of introduction to register. The district committee secretary added that in these difficult days when some older Communists still dare not stand up, seeing these new forces willing to throw themselves into the arms of the Party is infinitely exciting.
    On the way back, the driver told me that an hour ago, when his car passed through the square in this district, a group of bad elements blocked his way and shouted with clenched fists: Chinese, go back. He rushed through regardless. A month ago, I also encountered this situation near the Chain Bridge. Today, the struggle of the thugs in this dark corner should be their last struggle before their doomsday arrives. More than a dozen fully armed Hungarian officers and police have appeared in the square. Thugs who refuse to lay down their weapons and disrupt public safety and order should be tried by military tribunals!

    一个黑角落里的斗争
    本报记者　胡济邦
    9日，匈牙利工农革命政府公布了两个法令，一个是组织军事法庭并限时要反革命分子交出武器的法令；另一个是宣布解散市、区、州的工人委员会，只保留企业中的工人委员会的法令。
    这是革命力量向敌人进攻的坚决步骤。约在一个月前，布达佩斯化学仪器工厂的一部分工人就向政府建议过采取类似的措施。在这期间，政府领导人曾几次接待各地工人委员会的代表（其中有些是窃踞领导地位的反动分子）用极大的耐心来说服他们，说明罢工停产不能当作和政府谈话的武器，它会给国家和工人自己带来巨大的损失。正直的工人很快就能理解这种诚恳的语言，但是那些决心与革命政权为敌的反革命分子决不肯放弃自己的企图。11日曾有些工人委员会煽动四十八小时的罢工，表示对上述两个法令的抗拒。同时也有几位布达佩斯中央工人委员会的委员向广播电台声明他们不赞成罢工，并斥责这种罪恶的煽动。
    12日，我到多瑙河西岸布达那边一个反革命分子比较猖狂的地区了解情况。据区委书记说，这区有六十多家企业，但工人多在郊外居住，生活分散，平日进行教育比较困难。这一区的居民中有不少霍尔蒂时代的旧军人、高级知识分子和小资产阶层，政治情况复杂，建党工作也比较困难。
    一家制造电讯设备的贝劳扬尼斯工厂是这个区最大的一家工厂，过去属于英美资本。这个工厂的工人委员会是推动这个区甚至全市反革命活动的中心，这次解散的布达佩斯中央工人委员会的主席就是这个工厂的工人，名叫山多尔·腊奇，今年才二十二岁，据说是法西斯组织用两卡车的武装队伍保证他当选的，他就一直在法西斯主子的指使下行事。本月5日，这个区的各个工人委员会的反革命分子曾聚集一起讨论过发动再一次武装暴动的问题。但并没有实现。
    山多尔·腊奇利用布达佩斯中央工人委员会的名义在前几天组织了秘密的全国性会议，煽动颠复政府。他不管正直工人和技术人员的反对，他号召举行四十八小时的煽动性的普遍罢工。他和“自由欧洲”电台和西方报纸记者经常保持联系。据说昨天（11日）他已被逮捕了。
    在这家被黑暗势力所统治的工厂里，党的组织也终于建立起来了。另有一家联合收割机工厂，曾给我国制造不少定货，情况已完全好转，工人委员会的主席已由一位党员担任，这家工厂的工人并没有响应两天的罢工。
    11日，这个区的电车照常通行，但有匪徒跑上车去把一位司机用绳子捆起，不准他往前行驶，乘客们声张起来，警察马上赶到把暴徒抓走了。
    公共汽车两天没有开出，有些工人路远没有车坐就不去上工了，但有的还是步行到工厂去。
    区委会似乎刚开完一个会议，办公室里还留着一些人和一些烟雾。一位中年工人正在把一捆刚印好的传单塞进自己的皮包里，并答应明日黎明时分发出去。这时区委书记给我介绍说，他是本市公共汽车公司的司机，名叫道卡奇，他可以同你谈谈他们那边的情况。道卡奇就接下去说，公共汽车公司不是生产单位，照政府规定不应该组织工人委员会，但是工人委员会还是组织起来了。临时工人委员会最近经过改选后，仍然被坏分子所操纵。因为工人们还有些麻痹，共产党员很少，过去的党领导已被撤走。他自己是党员，但也警惕不高，在上次选举临时工人委员会时，他也赞成过一个大地主的儿子当主席，等到后来发觉时，这个临时主席已逃到奥地利去了。
    这次工人委员会没有和工人们商量就宣布罢工，他问他们这是民主还是独断专行？坏分子就用威胁回答他，要清算他。
    我们谈到这里时，外面突然传来连续的清晰的枪声，区委会的同志们马上都从自己皮包中取出手枪，向窗口走去。我也好奇地走到窗子那边看看外面的形势，但街上不像有什么暴徒进攻的迹象。被派去了解情况的人回来报告说：紧靠这条街口的广场上聚集着不少可疑的人群，企图阻止电车的行驶，后来不少匈牙利的军警赶到了，向天空放了枪，把人群驱散了。一座房子的窗口放出了冷枪。警察们马上进去搜查，可能抓到一些人。区委书记说：“敌人一直利用我们的人道主义，现在不能再用和平语言，而应该用力量向他们进攻了。我们表示出力量，居民们也就会坚强地站起来和敌人划清界线。几天来已看出居民们态度的转变。”他又说刚才走出去的那位青年忘记给你介绍，他叫勃拉日克，是电缆工厂的工人，他父亲是一位老共产党员，最近他申请入党，被批准了。在工厂的青年工人中，他努力进行宣传工作，今天他来到区委会，表示他再不能容忍反革命的横行霸道，要求到国家最需要的地方去：加入公安军。区委支持他的愿望，给他写介绍信去报名。区委书记补充一句说，在今天有些较老的共产党员还不敢站出来的困难日子里，看见这些新生力量愿意投到党的怀抱，感到无限的兴奋。
    在归途中，司机告诉我说，在一小时之前，他的车子经过这个区的广场时，一群坏分子阻挡他的去路，并且伸出拳头叫着：中国人滚回去。他不顾一切地冲走了。我在一个月前，在链子桥边也遭遇过这种情况。今天暴徒们在这个黑角里的挣扎应该是他们末日到来之前的最后挣扎。广场上已出现十多位全副武装的匈牙利军官和警察。不肯放下武器扰乱治安和秩序的暴徒们应该受到军事法庭的裁制！
              （12日于布达佩斯）
