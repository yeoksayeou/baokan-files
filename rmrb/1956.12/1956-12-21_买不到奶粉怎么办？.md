What to do if you can't buy milk powder?
　　Since July and August this year, milk powder has frequently been out of stock in the market. Many consumers, especially mothers of infants, are extremely anxious because they cannot buy milk powder, and have written letters criticizing the commercial departments for not preparing milk powder for the children. We sincerely accept these opinions and will reflect them to the relevant production departments.
　　The main reason for the current shortage of milk powder supply is that production cannot keep up with consumption needs. Although the industrial sector has taken active measures to increase production, due to the shortage of raw material - fresh milk, it can only gradually increase production, and it is impossible to meet the needs all at once.
　　So, what should infants eat now? According to our understanding, there are several brands of substitute milk powder and milk cakes on the market, such as Renren Tianru, Lutou substitute milk powder, Guangming substitute milk powder, Jian'er milk cake and Lutou milk cake, etc., and the quality is very good. According to the experiments of Professor Zhou Qiyuan of the Central Institute of Hygiene, the nutritional value of these brands of substitute milk powder and milk cakes is about the same as that of milk powder and fresh milk. Judging from the photos of infants he took during the experiment, many infants who eat substitute milk products are as fat as those who eat milk powder and fresh milk. In addition, the price of substitute milk products is also cheaper than that of milk powder and fresh milk, so we recommend consumers to try them.　China Sugar and Pastry Company

    买不到奶粉怎么办？
    今年七、八月以来，市场上的奶粉经常脱销，很多消费者、特别是婴儿的母亲们，因为买不到奶粉，焦急万分，纷纷来信指责商业部门为什么不给孩子们准备奶粉。我们诚恳地接受这些意见，并将这些意见反映给有关生产部门。
    目前奶粉供应不足的主要原因是生产量赶不上消费需要。工业部门虽已采取积极增产的措施，但由于原料——鲜牛奶不足，只能逐步地增产，不可能一下子满足需要。
    那么，当前婴儿吃什么呢？据我们了解，目前市场上有几个牌号的代乳粉和乳糕，如人人天乳、鹿头代乳粉、光明代乳粉、健儿奶糕和鹿头奶糕等，质量都很好。根据中央卫生研究院周启源教授的实验证明，这些牌号的代乳粉和乳糕的营养价值和奶粉、鲜牛奶的营养价值差不多，从他在实验时所拍的婴儿照片看，有很多吃代乳品的婴儿，同吃奶粉和鲜牛奶的婴儿一样胖，另外代乳品的价钱比奶粉和鲜牛奶的价钱也便宜，因此我们建议消费者试用。　中国糖业糕点公司
