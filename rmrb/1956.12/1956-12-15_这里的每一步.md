    Every Step Here
    By Gu Lei, Our Correspondent
    Quite a few people have asked me about my impression of the Qaidam Basin. My answer is very simple: life is tough, but not very tough.
    Before entering the basin, what I heard about life there was: no water to drink, no tents to live in, and meals that were feast or famine. So I bought a lot of dry food and canned goods, prepared for camping in my luggage, and bought a military canteen to carry water just in case. When I arrived in the basin, I regretted it very much: not only was I tired, but I was also laughed at for a while, saying that my thorough preparation was not timely, and that if I had brought these things in 1955, it would still not have been enough!
    Since then, I have been looking for traces of people's lives in 1955 in the basin. I have driven thousands of miles across the basin, spent many days on its edges, crossed high mountains and ridges, and stepped on endless salt-alkali areas and deserts. Geologists took me to climb countless steep ridges, walk into many colorful oil-bearing structures, and camp in the desert. I walked the path the geologists had walked – a path only geologists had walked. On this road, I saw the skeletons of camels tortured to death by drought, the corpses of birds, and the ashes of campsites left by geologists; on this road, it was often a thousand miles a day, with no villages or people in sight, and not a drop of water or a patch of grass; on this road, I often encountered a pile of messy footprints, leaving the small road and heading into the distance, not knowing where they had gone! Along the way, I walked into many white tents, listening to young people tell of their difficult past lives. At this time, I often thought of every step of work in the basin, every step of the geologists enduring the test of nature – a difficult step indeed!
    In 1955, the secrets of the Qaidam Basin began to be revealed! In these three hundred and sixty-odd days, the geologists' footprints covered the main corners of the basin, finding hundreds of oil-bearing structures with large areas and good closures, and also finding many other kinds of mineral deposits.
    This was not an easy task. The Qaidam Basin is very much like a naive and arrogant girl, who is cold and ruthless to everyone who walks beside her. At that time, there was no information to confirm that anyone had ever gone deep into the basin before. There were legends about it, mostly saying how herders who tried to cross the basin died of hunger and thirst in the middle of the journey, and the survivors had to abandon their livestock and property to return, bringing terror to the families and neighbors of the dead. As with any legend, after passing through several people's mouths, it is never as simple as it was originally, so everyone's impression of the Qaidam was: the wind blows stones, there is only sand and no grass; bears are in gangs, wolves are in packs, and big mosquitoes can eat people; no water, no firewood, die of thirst and hunger and no one buries you! More interestingly, it is said that there is a blind bear with particularly long eyelids, like curtains, that when it chases people, it runs for a while, lifts its eyelids to look, and then chases again. Naturally, most of these legends were exaggerated, but there was still some truth in them after all.
    Liu Zhanhe, chairman of the trade union of the 632nd Team of the Ministry of Geology, told me about the situation when they first entered the basin. He said, "We闯(chuǎng) came in by car, from 寸步难行(cùnbùnánxíng) inching forward to 畅行无阻(chàngxíngwúzǔ) unobstructed travel." There were originally no roads in the basin, and if you wanted to work, you had to scout the way. Liu Zhanhe and several others walked in front of the whole team, their task was to explore the road on the southern edge of the basin, starting from Golmud and ending at Mangnai. Two GAZ trucks, one large and one small, carried gasoline, grain, dried vegetables, water, and firewood; the only weapons they carried were: guns for self-defense, a compass to identify direction, and the determination to complete the task. The cars climbed over sand ridges, crossed alkali flats, and waded through mud swamps. Where the car went, there was a road.
    One day, while traveling to Zhongzaohuo, the large car sank when crossing a thawing ground, and the four wheels spun cotton. Qaidam in April was still freezing, with ice under the car in the morning and evening, and water under the car at noon. Everyone jumped out of the car and started digging mud. Digging a little, the car sank a little more. The sweet water they brought was running out, so they ate salty water, which caused diarrhea and left them with no strength. So everyone went out to collect thatch to pad under the car. Tired, they slept on the muddy ground next to the car. From April 5th to 7th, for three days and three nights, although every comrade suffered a lot, no one was discouraged. During the night's rest, they enthusiastically told various stories: "What is this suffering? In those years, the Red Army crossed the snowy mountains and grasslands, leaving a bloody footprint with every step!"
    On the fourth day, the car climbed out of the mud pit and continued forward, traveling only fifty kilometers the whole day. They finally reached the Na Linggele River, where the car was trapped by quicksand again. This river was twenty kilometers wide, full of quicksand, and when the wind rose, the fine sand flowed like waves. In the middle of the river, the car was like an old ox with its limbs cut off, breathing heavily but unable to take a step. The wind was particularly strong that day, and the sand was stirred up, dancing in the air. The sky was filled with yellow fog, and people could not be seen ten steps away; people dared not look up, and could catch a handful of soil by reaching out. Let's闯(chuǎng) break through! After walking for a day, they covered ten kilometers. The group lay under the car and slept all night, because they couldn't make a fire, and each person ate a few pieces of ice to quench their thirst. It took two days and two nights to get through this river without water.
    In this way, day and night, they traveled seven hundred kilometers in ten days and arrived at Mangnai. Along the way, they made marks with red willow branches for later comers. On one section of the road, they encountered many dried-up dead camels and human corpses, probably merchants who had died here in the past. Everyone jumped out of the car, buried the human corpses, used the camel bones as road signs, and continued forward.
    In this year, people from the 632nd Team and the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau were scattered everywhere in the basin. Some traveled by car, some rode camels, exploring the way and conducting general surveys at the same time. From south to north, from east to west, the difficulties encountered by each team were no less than those encountered by Liu Zhanhe and his team. They were often three or two people, taking hammers, compasses, water bottles, dry food, and marking poles, and going to places where no one had ever been before. On the road, they often thought of the legends about the basin, and there was still fear in their hearts, so they sang loudly, using their own voices to encourage themselves to move forward. At noon, the weather was particularly hot, and many people put on cotton-padded coats. According to their experience, wearing hollow cotton-padded coats had two major benefits: one was that they were empty inside, and the wind could easily enter, which was cooler than wearing a single layer of clothing; the other was that they were not easily exposed to the sun, so as to avoid being steamed to the point of suffocation. Sometimes, people who went out for general surveys lost their way and had to lie on the open ground as "团长(tuánzhǎng)" commanders. Those who returned home lit a big fire on the hilltop or high ground to attract their lost comrades back, sometimes waiting until dawn, and then dragging their tired bodies to work! In daily life, they had to fetch firewood by hand, and the camel dung was not discarded, but picked up and used as fuel. Speaking of vegetables, it was fungus, daylily, kelp, vermicelli, and cured meat. Because the water supply was insufficient, it was common practice not to wash their faces or feet. Everyone's face became dark, and their bodies were already very dirty, but they still went to look for traces of any kind of mineral deposit every day with a cheerful mood. Among these many difficulties, people often talked about water. One geologist told me, "When a person is so thirsty that their mouth is on fire, their lips are cracked, and their limbs are weak, they feel that the most precious thing in the world is water, and not anything else." This is not because there is no water in the basin, but because they had not found sweet water when they first entered the basin, and sometimes even if they found it, they could not transport it because of the long distance, bad roads, and too few vehicles. At that time, water threatened every geologist.
    The thirty-odd people of the first detachment of the 632nd Team accepted the task of conducting a general survey from Hongliuquan to Lenghu. To get to Lenghu, they had to pass through a section of the Gobi Desert more than 300 kilometers long, with no water and no grass in the middle. They were very happy, and everyone believed that "where there is no grass on the ground, there must be treasure underneath, and where there is no water, there must be oil." They set off with cars, radios, and all the necessities of life! At first, the whole team ate water that was pulled from Mangnai, more than 200 kilometers away from the starting point of the work, and the further they went, the further the distance became. There was also water in Hongliuquan, but it was bitter, and after drinking it, everyone had diarrhea six or seven times a day. In the first few days of the departure, the water from Mangnai was eaten, and because the supply could not keep up, everyone decided to eat the water from Hongliuquan. Although they had diarrhea, their stomachs were not uncomfortable, but they were hungry quickly. To save water, the detachment established a system: survey队员(duìyuán) members were only allowed to carry one壶(hú) pot of water each day when they set off, and they would not add more if it was not enough, and the rest would be handed in; each person was given a茶缸(chágāng) tea cylinder of water each day for brushing teeth and washing their face, and they were not allowed to wash their feet; the water for washing pots and bowls could not be poured out, but given to the camels to drink, or clarified and reused the next day. After six or seven days, they realized that they were using too much water, so they simply reduced the amount of water for washing their faces and brushing their teeth by half a缸(gāng) cylinder. At this time, for some reason, the car that went to fetch water never came back, and thirty-odd people had only two筒(tǒng) buckets of water, which was only enough to eat for two days. Everyone in the team was very nervous. What if the water truck didn't come!
    Guo Guixue, the branch secretary, and Gong Zhichao, the captain, discussed. Both of them were anxious, worrying that the water truck would break down on the road and not be able to pull water at all, and how to ensure the safety of the lives of more than thirty people! The whole team was in the middle of the Great Gobi, and they had to walk one or two hundred kilometers forward or backward to get water. But they couldn't just stop here. After discussing, they decided to continue working before cutting off the water and move forward, fortunately, they could still support it for two days, maybe the water truck could catch up, and if it really didn't work, they would突向(tūxiàng) break through to Lenghu. Gong Zhichao also introduced his experience in this regard, saying that as long as there was water for the driver to drink, and the others lay in the car without moving, there would be no major problem if they didn't drink water for three or four days. But what if the car broke down in the middle of the突围(tūwéi) breakthrough? Both of them thought of a way: send a telegram to the brigade headquarters to send a car to rescue them, and everyone would lie on the ground and wait. Then, a general meeting of all personnel was convened, explaining the current serious situation, calling on everyone to be calm, and not to run out alone, which was the most dangerous action; and repeatedly explaining: "The leadership has thought of many ways to ensure that everyone will not be in danger." They also asked everyone to discuss whether there were any other good ideas. After a period of discussion, it was still nothing more than the above-mentioned methods. After the meeting, the party branch convened a meeting of party members and Communist Youth League members, requiring each party member and Communist Youth League member to be calm and firm at this most difficult moment, to happily mobilize everyone to be active, and not to panic about this matter. Many people could not fall asleep early that night. Songs were constantly coming out of the tents. Although the songs made people hear that they were not carefree, there was no atmosphere of panic.
    On the day when the water was about to run out, the队员(duìyuán) members set off to work as usual, looking for oil. On this day, everyone felt that the sun was particularly scorching, and everyone needed water especially! The endless sandy land was so dry that it made people dizzy. On the very distant horizon, the light reflected from the ground passed through the atmosphere and looked white, like the ocean or like slightly moving lake water. But this was just an illusion, a幻影(huànyǐng) phantom that disappointed people. The sun was setting faster than usual. It should have been hanging high in one place, waiting for the water truck to arrive before going to rest, but the sun plunged into the earth quickly, and night came! At this time, only half a桶(tǒng) bucket of water was placed in front of the whole team, which was the hope of the whole team, and also the source of terror. Should we eat this half桶(tǒng) bucket of water? Everyone unanimously decided not to eat dinner that night, and to留下来(liúxiàlái) stay here to break through, in order to save the lives of those comrades, and to ensure that the driver comrades would not faint at the steering wheel. The leaders of the team notified everyone to prepare their luggage. Many people became even more nervous! What was waiting for them on the road tomorrow? Death? Or survival? This group of young people are now worried about one thing, that is, they have not completed their mission. It was painful to leave here.
    At this time, there was still hope. When they went forward these two days, they had dropped some gasoline barrels and wooden signs on the road, on which they wrote many words, the general idea was: "Old Zhang同志(tóngzhì) comrade, the water is gone, be sure to catch up with us overnight." Maybe Old Zhang who pulled the water saw it, and maybe he would arrive overnight. It was a night that was difficult to安宁(ānníng) be quiet! As midnight approached, a faint喇叭(lǎba) horn sounded in the distance. Hope带(dài) brought everyone out of the tents. In the distant place, at the edge of the darkness, two lights were flashing, approaching step by step. It was Old Zhang who had arrived in the water truck! He said, "I saw the words on the sign."
    When I entered the basin, I was a year later than those who had endured the hard life, and I did not see with my own eyes every step of the difficulties they had experienced. During the days of my visit, the car was speeding on the highway, I could eat hot meals everywhere, taste many fresh vegetables, drink the good water of Da Qaidam, Lenghu, and Mangnai, and live in mobile houses and newly built earth and wood houses. Everywhere, no one was worried about these life problems anymore. Life in the Qaidam Basin has taken a turn. Whenever I asked people here about their past lives, they always told the past so calmly and happily, as if many difficulties were insignificant. Among these people, there are battle-hardened部队(bùduì) troop commanders and soldiers, drivers who had driven and dodged enemy aircraft on the Korean battlefield, and游击队员(yóujīduìyuán) guerrilla fighters during the War of Resistance Against Japan. They said, "If you want to talk about hardship, it can't be compared with the past, and you know why we don't take these difficulties seriously! Besides, the living conditions have changed greatly now!" The young geological workers said even more interestingly: "Because we have the志趣(zhìqù) interests and理想(lǐxiǎng) ideals of finding treasures. Think about it, if we always squat on the沥青(lìqīng) asphalt roads of East and West Chang'an Street, only sitting in the tourist boats of Kunming Lake, where would the石油(shíyóu) oil come from! Geological workers have to find treasures in hard life." Every sentence is full of毅(yì) tenacity and勇敢(yǒnggǎn) courage. In fact, they had said these words long ago when they first entered the basin. They had said to the people of the whole country: "Today, we live in tents, and tomorrow there will be neatly arranged houses; rugged trails will become条条(tiáotiáo) strips of asphalt roads; the idle Gasikule Lake will become a swimming pool; the Kunlun Mountains, which are difficult to climb and covered with snow all year round, will become factories that replace artificial ice. We – young geological workers, will erect oil towers in this uninhabited place, and we will build a beautiful home in the barren basin." So, they used the song "It is the wind of the Kunlun Mountains that blows our red flag" to encourage themselves to move forward! When I saw the towering drilling towers in the areas of Mahai, Lenghu, and Mangnai, I thought of their words and their songs again. Facing all the sights of the basin, I thought: The geological workers are moving towards victory step by step, and the Qaidam Basin has been conquered!

    这里的每一步
    本报记者　顾雷
    曾有不少人，问我对柴达木盆地的印象，我回答得非常简单：生活很艰苦，也并不很艰苦。
    进盆地以前，我听到的盆地生活是：喝不上水、住不上帐篷、饭是饥一顿饱一顿。我便买了许多干粮、罐头，在行装上作了露营的准备，外买一个军用水壶，背上水以防万一。到了盆地，非常后悔：挨了累不说，还被别人笑话了一阵，说我这种周到的准备不是时候，还说要是在1955年带这些东西还太少呢！
    从此，我就在盆地中寻找人们1955年生活的痕迹。我曾行车千里横贯盆地，在它的边缘活动不少时日，翻过高山大岭、踏过望不到尽头的盐碱地带和戈壁；地质人员带着我爬过无数个陡梁，走进许多个彩色的储油构造，在戈壁上住过宿。我走着地质人员走过的路——一条只有地质人员走过的路。在这条路上，我看见被干旱折磨死的骆驼的骸骨、飞鸟的尸体，旁边有地质人员走过时留下的露营的灰烬；在这条路上，常常是日行千里，看不见村庄和人烟，也看不到一片水、一堆青草；在这条路上，不时遇到一堆杂乱的脚印，离开小路，向远方走去，不知道他们曾走到什么地方！我沿途走进过许多白色的帐篷，听着青年人述说过去艰难的生活。这时候，每每使我想到盆地工作的每一步，地质人员经受大自然考验的每一步，这是艰苦的一步啊！
    1955年，柴达木的秘密开始被揭破了！在这三百六十多天中，地质人员的足迹，遍及盆地的主要角落，找到了上百个面积大、圈闭良好的储油构造，也找到了许多种其他矿藏。
    这不是轻而易举的事。柴达木盆地，十分像一个不知天高地厚而生性傲慢的少女，对走进她身旁的每个人，都是冷酷无情的。当时，找不到任何资料可以证实以前曾有人深入盆地。属于这方面的传说是有的，大都是说试图穿过盆地的牧民，如何在中途饥渴而死，幸存者不得不丢下牲畜和财产走回头路，把恐怖带给死者的家属同邻人。大凡一种传说，经过几个人的嘴以后，总不会像原来那样朴实了，于是大家对柴达木的印象是：风刮石头跑，只有沙子没有草；熊成帮、狼成群，大蚊子能吃人；没有水，没有柴，渴死饿死无人埋！更有趣的，说有一种瞎熊，眼皮特别长，像门帘那样，它赶人的时候，跑一段路，掀起眼皮看看，再追。自然，这些传说有大部分被夸大了，但是，其中毕竟还有三分真实。
    地质部六三二队工会主席刘占和，向我讲过开始进盆地的情形。他说：“我们是坐着车闯进来的，由寸步难行，到畅行无阻。”盆地原来没有路，想工作，必须探路。刘占和同其他几个人，走在全队的前面，任务是探清盆地南缘的道路，起点是噶尔穆，终点是芒崖。两个嘎斯车，一大一小，车上拉着汽油、粮食、干菜、水、柴；带的全部武器是：自卫用的枪、识别方向的罗盘、完成任务的决心。汽车翻沙梁、越碱滩、涉泥沼，车走到那里，那里就算有了路。
    一天，走至中灶火，过翻浆地时，大车陷下去了，四个车轮直纺棉花。四月的柴达木还是冰冻的日子，早晨和晚上车子下边是冰，中午车下是水。大家跳下车，动手挖泥。挖一点，汽车往下沉一点。车上带的甜水快用完了，便吃咸水，吃下去就拉稀，周身都没有力量。于是大家四出打茅草，往车下垫。累了，睡在车旁泥地上。从4月5日到7日，整整三天三夜，尽管每个同志很苦，却没有人气馁，夜间休息的时候，还兴致勃勃地讲各种故事：“这算什么苦？当年红军，过雪山草地，一步留下一个血印哪！”
    第四天，车爬出了泥坑，继续向前走，整个一天，才走了五十公里。好容易到了那棱格勒河，车又被流沙困住了。这条河宽二十公里，中间全是流沙，风起处，细沙像波浪一样滚滚地流动。汽车在河中间，像被削去四肢的老牛，喘气虽粗，却难迈动一步。这天，风特别大，沙子被扬起，在空中起舞，天空弥漫着黄色的浓雾，十步外不见人；人不敢抬头，伸出手，能接住一把土。闯吧！走了一天，走了十公里，大伙躺在车底下睡了一夜，因为没法生火，每人吃了几块冰解渴。两天两夜，才通过了这条没有水的河。
    就这样，他们夜以继日，十天走了七百公里，到了茫崖。沿途，他们用红柳枝给后来人做了记号。在一段路上，他们碰见不少被蒸干了的死骆驼和人的尸首，这大概是过去的商旅在这里亡命的。大家跳下车，把人的尸体掩埋了，用骆驼的骨头做路标，继续前行。
    这一年，盆地里到处散布着六三二队和青海石油勘探局的人。有的乘车，有的骑骆驼，一面探路、一面进行普查工作。从南到北、由东到西，每一个队所遇到的困难，都不比刘占和他们遇到的少。他们经常是三个或两个人，带上锤子、罗盘、水壶、干粮、标杆，到从没人走过的地方去。路上常想起对盆地的传说，内心的恐惧还是有的，于是大声地歌唱，用自己的声音鼓励自己往前走。中午，天气特别炎热，许多人把棉袄穿上，照他们的经验，穿空心棉袄有两大好处：一是里边空荡荡的，风容易进去，比穿单衣风凉；一是不容易晒透，免得把人蒸得透不过气来。有时，出外普查的人，迷失了方向，不得不躺在露天地上当“团长”；而回到家里的人，便在山头上或高地上燃起大火，招引迷失方向的伙伴们归来，有时一直等到天亮，又拖着疲劳的身子工作去了！在日常生活中，烧柴要亲手去打，骆驼拉的屎，舍不得丢掉，捡起来作燃料。说到菜，就是木耳、黄花菜、海带、粉条、腊肉。因为水供应不足，不洗脸、不洗脚已习以为常。每个人的脸变得黝黑了，身上已经很脏了，仍然是每天怀着愉快的情绪，去寻找任何一种矿藏的痕迹。在这许许多多困难中，人们常常说到水。一个地质人员告诉我：“当人渴得满嘴冒火，烧裂嘴唇，四肢无力的时候，觉得世界上最宝贵的东西是水，而不是别的。”这并不是盆地没有水，而是刚进盆地没有找到甜水，有时虽然找到了，因为路途远、道路不好、车辆太少，运不上吃的。当时，水威胁着每一个地质人员。
    六三二队一分队的三十多个人，接受了从红柳泉到冷湖的普查任务。要到冷湖，必得通过三百多公里的一段戈壁，中间没有水，也没有草。他们很高兴，每个人都相信“地上没有草，下面定有宝，没有水，准有油。”他们带上汽车、电台和所有生活用品出发了！开始，全队吃的水，都是从芒崖拉的，离工作起点二百多公里，愈往前走距离愈远。红柳泉也有水，却是苦的，吃过以后，每天要拉六、七次稀。出发的头几天，吃的芒崖水，因为供应不上，大家决定吃红柳泉的水，虽说拉稀，肚子可不难受，只是饿得快。为节省水，分队立了个制度：普查队员，每天出发只准带水一壶，不够的不添，剩下的交回；每人每天发一茶缸水，作刷牙、洗脸之用，不准洗脚；刷锅洗碗的水不能泼掉，给骆驼喝，或澄清了第二天再用。过了六、七天，发觉用水太多，索性把洗脸、刷牙的水减少半缸。这时，不知为什么，去拉水的车总是不回来了，三十多个人，只有两筒水，仅够吃两天了，全队的人都很紧张，水车不来怎么办呢！
    支部书记郭贵学和队长巩志超商量。两个人都着急，耽心水车坏在路上，根本拉不来水，如何保证三十多个人的生命安全呢！全队正处在大戈壁的中间，向前或者退后，都要走一两百公里才有水。但是，也不能停在这里不动呀。讨论来、讨论去，决定断水前还要继续工作，往前走，好在还可以支持两天，说不定水车能赶上来，实在不行的时候，再向冷湖突。巩志超还介绍了这方面的经验，说只要有水给司机喝，其他人躺在车上不动，三、四天不喝水没有大问题。可是，如果在突围的时候，中途车子坏了又怎么办呢？两个人都想到一条办法：给大队部发电报，派车来急救，大家躺在地上等着。接着，召开了全体人员大会，说明了当前的严重情况，号召每一个人要沉着，不要单独向外跑，那是最危险的行动；并且一再说明：“领导上已想了许多办法，保证大家不会有危险。”还让大家讨论，看还有什么良策。讨论了一阵，仍然不外乎上面几个办法。散会以后，党支部召集党员、团员开会，要求每个党员、团员在这最困难的时刻镇静、坚定，要愉快地去动员大家活跃起来，不要为这件事惊慌。这天晚上，很多人不能早早入睡。歌声不时地从帐篷里传出，这歌声虽使人听得出并非是无忧无虑的，却没有惶恐的气氛。
    水将要全部用完的这天，队员们照常出发工作，去寻找石油。这天，大家觉得太阳特别灼热，每个人也特别需要水了！一望无边的沙地，干旱得令人头晕。在很远很远的地平线上，地面反射出的光穿过大气，看去白茫茫一片，像是海洋，又像是微动的湖水。但是，这只是一种错觉，是使人失望的幻影。太阳，比往日落得快了，她是应该高高挂在一个地方不动，等着水车到来再去休息的，然而，太阳飞快地栽进大地，夜来临了！这时，摆在全队面前只有半桶水，这是全队的希望所在，也是恐怖的所在。这半桶水吃不吃呢？大家一致决议晚上不吃饭了，留下来带着突围，以备去挽救那个同志的生命，保证司机同志不会晕倒在方向盘上。队的领导人通知大家准备行装。许多人的心情更紧张了！明天，在路上等着他们的是什么呢？死亡？还是生存？这群年青人，现在还耽心一件事，那就是没有完成任务。离开这里是痛心的。
    这时，希望还是有的。这两天往前走的时候，曾在路上丢下一些汽油筒和木牌子，上面写了许多字，大意是说：“老张同志，水没有了，务必星夜赶上我们。”或许拉水的老张看到了，说不定连夜赶到。是个令人难以安静的夜晚啊！深夜临近了，远处传来一声隐隐约约的喇叭声。希望把大家带出帐篷。遥远的地方、黑幕的边缘，有两盏灯闪着光，一步步逼近了，是老张开着水车到了！他说：“我看到牌子上的字了。”
    我进盆地的时候，比那些经受艰苦生活的人迟了一年，没有亲眼看到他们经历的困难的每一步。在访问的日子里，汽车在公路上飞驰着，到处可以吃到热的饭，尝到不少新鲜蔬菜的味道，喝过大柴旦、冷湖、芒崖的好水，住过活动房屋和新建的土木房子。到处，已没有人再为这些生活问题发愁了。柴达木盆地的生活翻了个身。每当我向这里的人询问过去生活的时候，他们总是那样从容、高兴地述说过去，似乎许多困难都是微不足道的。这些人中，有身经百战的部队指挥员同战士，有在朝鲜战场上开车与敌机周旋过的司机、有抗日战争时候的游击队员。他们说：“要说艰苦，是不能同过去比的，你就知道我们为什么不把这些困难放在眼里了！何况现在的生活条件已经大大改变了呢！”而年青的地质工作者说得更有趣：“因为我们有寻找宝藏的志趣和理想。你想，如果我们总蹲在东西长安街的沥青路上，只坐在昆明湖的游船里，石油从那里来呢！地质工作者嘛，就是要在艰苦的生活中找出宝藏。”句句话充满着刚毅和勇敢。其实，这些话他们在刚进盆地的时候早就说过了，他们曾向全国人民说：“今天，我们住的是帐篷，明天会有排列整齐的房屋出现；崎岖不平的小道，会变成条条沥青马路；闲荡着的尕斯库勒湖，会变成游泳池；攀登困难、积雪常年不化的昆仑山，会变成代替人造冰的工厂。我们——年青的地质工作者，就要在这没有人烟的地方竖立起油塔，就是要在荒凉的盆地里建立美好的家园。”于是用“是那昆仑山的风吹动着我们的红旗”的歌声，鼓舞着自己前进了！当我在马海、冷湖、芒崖地区看到高耸的钻塔的时候，我重新想到了他们的话和他们的歌，面对盆地的一切景象，我想：地质工作者们在步步走向胜利，柴达木盆地被征服了！
