Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, December 17th: Engineers, technicians, and medical personnel of the People's Liberation Army Fujian Front troops are saving a large amount of materials for the country.

    In barrack design, engineer Qiu Lang observed many local folk house buildings and thought that, according to the natural conditions of Fujian Province with its strong winds, heavy rain, and no snowfall, the slope of the roof could be flatter than in the north. After this rationalization suggestion he made to the leadership was adopted, more than 20,000 cubic meters of wood and 5.5 million tiles were saved in this year's barrack construction.

    These materials could be used to build more than fifty canteens capable of accommodating seven hundred people. When a certain unit built a new batch of ships, engineer Huang Yi and the technicians repeatedly calculated during the design process in order not to waste an inch of wood or a nail, and as a result, the cost was reduced by 21%, and the quality was good.

    Many hospitals in the Fujian troops are adopting some inexpensive Chinese medicines to replace Western medicines. Dong Daoheng, the director of a certain hospital, and the military doctors used Chinese medicine Pulsatilla chinensis to treat dysentery, which was more than half the price of using sulfonamide and other Western medicines, and the treatment effect was proven to be greater than that of Western medicines according to clinical experiments. Now, this hospital is organizing its employees to go to the mountains to pick medicinal materials and process and copy them themselves.

    想各种办法为国家节省资材
    据新华社福建前线17日电　中国人民解放军福建前线部队的工程师、技术人员和医务人员等为国家节省大批资材。
    在营房设计中，工程师丘駺观察了许多当地的民房建筑，想到根据福建省风大、雨多和不下雪的自然条件，屋面的坡度可以比北方平。他向领导上提出的这个合理化建议被采用以后，在今年营房修建中，就节省了二万多立方公尺木材和五百五十万块瓦片。
    这些材料可以用来建筑容纳七百人的食堂五十多座。某部新建一批船只的时候，工程师黄一和技术员们为了不浪费一寸木材、一根钉子，在设计中反复计算，结果造价降低了21％，而且质量良好。
    福建部队的许多医院正在采用一些价格低廉的中药代替西药。某医院院长董道恒和军医们用中药白头翁治疗痢疾，比用磺胺等西药要便宜一半以上，治疗的效果根据临床实验证明比西药还大。现在，这个医院正在组织员工们上山采摘药材，自己加工复制。
