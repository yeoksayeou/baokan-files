　　Insisting on Retaining Extraterritoriality in Philippine Military Bases
　　The United States Unilaterally Announces Indefinite Adjournment of US-Philippine Negotiations

    Xinhua News Agency, Manila, December 7th: Negotiations between the United States and the Philippines regarding the revision of the 1947 Military Bases Agreement have been adjourned indefinitely as of December 5th.

    The request for adjournment was made by the United States. In a written statement read at the meeting on the 5th, U.S. representative Smith stated that the U.S. government believes that "a temporary suspension of these negotiations is urgently needed so that both sides can re-examine the entire situation during the recess."

    Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Garcia said after the meeting that the implementation of the adjournment was a unilateral decision by the United States. The Philippine delegation did not make such a request, therefore "it can only be said that it took note of this notification."

    Philippine delegation spokesman Pelaez told reporters after the meeting, "I personally believe this is an insult to the Philippine delegation." He said that the decision "was a complete surprise to us."

    The US-Philippine negotiations began on August 11th of this year. Because the United States refused to relinquish its extraterritorial rights over military bases in the Philippines, the negotiations remained deadlocked. There was a recess in September, during which the U.S. chief representative Benderzen returned home to consult with President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles. He returned to Manila in October to resume negotiations, but because the United States still insisted on retaining extraterritoriality, and later even requested the Philippines to allocate approximately 3,000 more hectares of land to expand the U.S. military bases in the Philippines, the negotiations were unsuccessful.

### 坚持保留在菲军事基地的治外法权　美国片面宣布美菲谈判无限期休会

　  坚持保留在菲军事基地的治外法权
　　美国片面宣布美菲谈判无限期休会
    据新华社7日讯　马尼拉消息：美国和菲律宾关于修改1947年军事基地协定的谈判已经在12月5日无限期休会。
    休会的要求是美国方面提出来的。美方代表史密斯在5日举行的会议上宣读的书面声明说，美国政府认为，“暂时停止这些谈判是迫切需要的，以便双方在休会期间重新研究整个情况”。
    菲律宾副总统兼外交部长加西亚在会后说，实行休会是美方单方面决定的。菲律宾代表团没有提出这样的要求，因此“它只能说它注意到这个通知”。
    菲律宾代表团的发言人佩拉埃斯在会后对报界说，“我个人认为这是对菲律宾代表团的侮辱”。他说，这个决定“对于我们是一件完全意外的事”。
    美菲的这次谈判是在今年8月11日开始的，由于美国拒绝放弃它在菲律宾的军事基地上的治外法权，谈判一直陷于僵持状态。9月间曾经休会一次，美方首席代表本德岑回国同总统艾森豪威尔和国务卿杜勒斯磋商。他在10月间回到马尼拉恢复谈判，可是由于美国仍然坚持保留治外法权，而且后来还要求菲律宾再拨出约三千公顷土地，来扩充美国在菲律宾的军事基地，谈判没有结果。
