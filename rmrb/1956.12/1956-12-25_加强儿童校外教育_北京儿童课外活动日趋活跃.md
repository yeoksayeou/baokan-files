Xinhua News Agency Report: Xinhua News Agency reporter Bu Zhaowen reports: Extracurricular education for children in Beijing has attracted attention and importance from society. Currently, children's extracurricular activities are beginning to become active, and the phenomenon of children wandering and loitering on the streets has significantly decreased.

As centers for providing extracurricular education to children, the Children's Homes scattered throughout the districts and the Beijing Children's Palace have changed their working methods. In the past, the Children's Palace and the district Children's Homes were only open on Saturday afternoons and Sundays, but now they are open all day and have added activities that can attract a large number of children to participate. Every afternoon, many children come to the Beijing Children's Palace to watch slides, movies, and listen to stories. The Dongdan District Children's Home recently opened an ice skating rink outside Chaoyangmen specifically for children and has prepared many ice skates for children to borrow.

The cultural centers and workers' clubs in various districts are also enthusiastically organizing extracurricular activities for children. The Dongdan District Workers' Club has allocated a hall that can accommodate four hundred people to provide children with a reading room and recreational activities. Some cultural centers have newly established activity stations for children, organizing film screenings, storytelling sessions, and social gatherings every week. Some children have also been recruited as members of slide projection teams, actors in children's puppet troupes, and participants in the organization and management of children's reading rooms. The Xidan District Cultural Center organized a children's shadow puppet troupe to help children rehearse and perform their own plays.

Some street residents' committees also attach great importance to children's extracurricular education. The Dongtangzi Hutong Residents' Committee, seeing that many children were playing in the hutong after school and neglecting their studies, mobilized their mothers to voluntarily donate children's books or some money to create a children's library, which is managed by street activists who are enthusiastic about children's education on a rotating basis.

Most of the primary schools implementing the two-shift system have cooperated with parents to organize family study groups so that students can review their lessons in an organized manner outside of school.

The recent district people's congress meetings held in Dongdan and other districts also held special discussions on children's extracurricular education. The representatives unanimously agreed that strengthening children's extracurricular education should immediately attract the attention of all sectors of society.

    加强儿童校外教育
    北京儿童课外活动日趋活跃
    据新华社讯　新华社记者卜昭文报道：北京市儿童的校外教育已经引起社会上的关心和重视。目前儿童的课外活动开始活跃起来，儿童在街上游荡、闲逛的现象显著减少。
    作为对儿童进行校外教育的中心——散布在各区的少年之家和北京市少年宫都已经改变了他们的工作方法。过去少年宫和各区少年之家都是在星期六下午和星期日才开放，现在都改成整天开放了，并且增加了一些能够大量吸引儿童参加的活动。每天下午，北京市少年宫里都有许多少年儿童前来观看幻灯、电影和听故事。东单区少年之家新近在朝阳门外专门为儿童开辟了滑冰场，还准备了许多供儿童借用的冰鞋。
    各区的文化馆和工人俱乐部也热心地组织儿童校外活动。东单区工人俱乐部拨出可容四百人的大厅，供给儿童作图书阅览室和文娱活动场所。一些文化馆新建立了少年儿童活动站，每个星期都组织电影演出、故事会、联欢晚会等活动。有的儿童还被吸收为幻灯放映队队员、儿童木偶剧团演员以及参加儿童图书阅览室的组织管理工作。西单区文化馆组织了儿童皮影剧团，帮助儿童自己排练演出。
    有些街道居民委员会对儿童的校外教育也给予很大重视。东堂子胡同居民委员会看到许多孩子放学回家以后在胡同里打闹，使学业荒废，便发动他们的妈妈们自动捐献儿童图书或一些钱，创办了一个儿童图书室，由热心儿童教育的街道积极分子轮流担任管理工作。
    大部分实行二部制的小学都和家长配合，组织了家庭学习小组，使学生在校外也能有组织地复习功课。
    东单等区最近召开的区人民代表大会会议，还对儿童的校外教育工作作了专题讨论。代表们一致认为，加强儿童校外教育应立即引起社会上各方面的重视。
