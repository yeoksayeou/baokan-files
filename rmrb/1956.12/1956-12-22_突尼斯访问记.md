    A Visit to Tunisia
    Li Xuechun
    (IX) The Great Mosque
    When traveling in a country that believes in Islam, you can see incense-filled mosques no matter which town or village you go to. But the mosque we visited was no ordinary one. Because it is the highest institution of learning in Tunisia; at the same time, it is also a magnificent historical building in Tunisia.
    The Great Mosque is located in the city center of Kairouan, one of the oldest cities in Tunisia. Our car left the wheat-producing area of ​​northern Tunisia, traveled more than 300 kilometers, passed through vast fields full of olives and wild figs, and arrived at the ancient city of Kairouan in central Tunisia. Kairouan is different from other cities in Tunisia we have visited. It is an ancient and completely Tunisian city, symbolizing the national spirit of Tunisia; I heard that many Tunisian anti-colonial nationalist patriots are trained here.
    The Great Mosque is also known as the "Zitouna" College. This is the only national college in Tunisia. It has branches in cities such as Tunis and Sfax, with a total of 35,000 students. Students mainly study the Koran, and also study politics, economics, geography, history, foreign languages, and other courses. Before independence, French colonialists forbade Tunisians from learning Arabic and Tunisian national history. All Tunisian schools used French as the language of instruction. Only "Zitouna" College, with the support of the Tunisian people, maintained the right to teach in Arabic after arduous struggles. Patriotic Muslims in Tunisia voluntarily took out money to maintain the college's funding. Before independence, students of "Zitouna" College studied under very difficult conditions. They slept on grass mats on the floor of the Great Mosque, and the poorly lit classrooms were also the students' dormitories. Professors and students sat together on the grass-mat floor to study.
    The Great Mosque was built in 670 AD. It was originally an Arab military camp and still retains many military features. The entire building of the Great Mosque is a square courtyard, with a tall watchtower in the northwest. Standing on this watchtower, the entire city of Kairouan is displayed before your eyes. This is a completely white Arab city, with towering domed mosques standing among the flat-roofed houses. There is a large artificial lake north of the city, which is said to have been built at the same time as the Great Mosque. The four corners of the Great Mosque are equipped with guard posts, and the gate tower is equipped with enemy defense equipment. The main hall of the Great Mosque can accommodate more than 10,000 people. There are a total of 510 huge pillars in the hall, which are said to have been brought by the Arabs from Rome.
    After Tunisia's independence, the Tunisian government has begun to build new school buildings for "Zitouna" College in cities such as Tunis and Sfax, and plans to improve teaching, increase courses in modern science, and expand the scale of the college, so that it can become a modern national higher education institution to train talents in various fields for Tunisia's construction cause after independence.
    (X) The Tunisian Plateau
    On August 14th, we left the fertile wheat-producing area and dense olive groves of northern Tunisia and came to the central Tunisian plateau, which is already the northern edge of the world-famous Sahara Desert.
    Our car galloped on the plateau; the hot wind blowing from the Sahara Desert, carrying rolling yellow sand, roared on the plateau. Four consecutive years of drought have ravaged the originally green and beautiful plateau beyond recognition. The land is cracked, the vegetation is withered, and as far as the eye can see, there is barren wilderness everywhere. Several low thatched huts are scattered along the road. The owners of the houses have been driven away by the drought, and the roofs have also been blown away by the strong winds. How miserable is the fate of the farmers on the Tunisian plateau! They were originally the owners of the fertile land in northern Tunisia. The French colonialists seized their land and drove them to this arid plateau. Due to extreme poverty, they have no money to dig wells, so they cannot resist the invasion of drought. Now, they are forced to leave the plateau and live a wandering life everywhere.
    In this vast wilderness, there are also several oases like isolated islands on the sea. These are the few wealthier farmers on the plateau. Because they occupy springs or have dug wells, they can resist the drought and avoid the suffering of leaving their homes and wandering. On August 15th, we visited one of the villages - the village of Smemni. This is a village with 4,500 residents and 200 hectares of land. Each person in the village has less than eight-tenths of a hectare on average, but because they have springs, they all live a relatively stable life. In this boundless wilderness, this small oasis looks particularly beautiful. The spring water flows slowly from the highlands west of the village, and the criss-crossing canals surround the village like spider webs. The farmers plant various crops and fruit trees on this land. There are corn, millet and peanuts, dates, peaches, honey pears, grapes and pomegranates.
    There is a saying among the farmers here: "Water plus plateau equals prosperity." After independence, the Tunisian government, in order to solve the livelihood problems of homeless and unemployed farmers, is planning to organize farmers to reclaim the plateau and assist farmers in digging wells to change the face of the barren plateau.

    突尼斯访问记
    李学纯
    （九）大清真寺
    在一个信仰伊斯兰教的国家里旅行，无论你走到那一个城镇和乡村，都可以看到香烟缭绕的清真寺。但是我们访问的一座清真寺，却非同一般。因为它是突尼斯的最高学府；同时它也是突尼斯的一座辉煌的历史建筑物。
    大清真寺位于突尼斯最古老的城市之一——开洛恩的市中心。我们的汽车离开了突尼斯北部的产麦区，经过三百多公里的路程，穿过长满了橄榄和野无花果的广阔的原野，来到了突尼斯中部的古城开洛恩。开洛恩与我们到过的突尼斯的其他城市不同，这是一座古老的完全突尼斯化的城市，它象征着突尼斯的民族精神；听说很多突尼斯的反殖民主义的民族志士都是从这里培养出来的。
    大清真寺又名“齐东纳”学院。这是突尼斯唯一的一座全国性的学院，它在突尼斯、斯法克斯等城市都设有分院，共有学生三万五千名。学生主要学习可兰经，另外还学习政治、经济、地理、历史、外文等课程。独立前，法国殖民主义者禁止突尼斯人学习阿拉伯语，禁止突尼斯人学习突尼斯民族的历史，所有突尼斯的学校都用法文授课，只有“齐东纳”学院，在突尼斯人民的支持下，经过坚苦的斗争，保持了用阿拉伯文授课的权利。突尼斯的爱国的穆斯林们，自动拿出钱来，维持了这座学院的经费。独立前的“齐东纳”学院的学生们，在非常艰苦的条件下进行学习。他们睡在大清真寺铺了草席的地板上，光线很坏的教室同时也就是学生们的宿舍。教授和学生一齐坐在铺着草席的地板上进行学习。
    大清真寺建于公元670年。它原是一座阿拉伯军营，至今还保存着许多军事上的特征。大清真寺的整个建筑是一个方形的大院子，西北有一座很高的了望塔。登上这座了望塔，整个开洛恩市容便展现在你的眼前。这是一座完全白色的阿拉伯城市，在平顶的民房之间，耸立着一座座圆顶的高大的清真寺。城北有一个很大的人工湖，据说是和大清真寺同时建造的。大清真寺的四角都设有岗亭，大门的门楼上设有御敌的设备。大清真寺的大厅能容一万多人，大厅里共有五百一十根巨大的圆柱，据说这些圆柱都是阿拉伯人从罗马带来的。
    突尼斯独立后，突尼斯政府已开始在突尼斯、斯法克斯等城市建筑“齐东纳”学院的新校舍，并计划改进教学，增加现代科学知识的课程，扩大学院规模，使它成为一座现代化的民族的高等学院，以为突尼斯独立后的建设事业培养各方面的人材。
    （十）突尼斯高原
    8月14日，我们离开了突尼斯北部的肥沃的产麦区和茂密的橄榄林，来到了突尼斯中部高原，这里已是世界闻名的撒哈拉沙漠的北部边缘了。
    我们的汽车在高原上奔驰；从撒哈拉沙漠上吹来的热风，带着滚滚的黄沙，在高原上怒吼。连续四年的旱灾，把原来是绿色的美丽的高原，摧残得不像样了。大地干裂了，草木干枯了，一眼望去，到处是光秃秃的荒野。路旁散落着几座低低的草屋，屋子的主人被旱灾赶走了，屋顶也被狂风卷走了。突尼斯高原上的农民的命运是多么苦啊！他们原来都是突尼斯北部的肥沃的土地的主人，法国殖民主义者夺去了他们的土地，把他们驱逐到这干旱的高原上来。由于极端贫困，他们无钱打井，因此不能抵御旱灾的侵袭，现在，又被迫离开了高原，到处过着流浪的生活。
    在这辽阔的荒野上，也有几处像大海上的孤岛似的绿洲。这是高原上的少数较富裕的农民，由于占有了泉水，或者打了井，因此能够抵御旱灾，避免了离乡背井的流浪生活之苦。8月15日，我们访问了其中的一个村庄——士密尼村。这是一个有四千五百个居民和二百公顷土地的村子。全村每人平均不到八分地，但是由于有了泉水，他们都过着比较安定的生活。在这一望无际的荒野上，这个小小的绿洲显得分外美丽。泉水从村西的高地上缓缓流下，纵横的水渠像蛛网似的围绕在村子的周围。农民们在这块土地上种植着各种各样的庄稼和果树，这里有玉蜀黍、谷子和花生，有海枣子、桃子、蜜梨、葡萄和石榴。
    这里农民有句格言：“水加高原就是繁荣”。独立后的突尼斯政府，为了解决无家可归的失业农民的生活问题，正计划组织农民开垦高原，协助农民打井，来改变荒芜的高原的面貌。　（未完）（附图片）
