Xinhua News Agency report: Since the beginning of this year, thousands of upper-class figures from various ethnic groups in Sichuan's minority areas, including Living Buddhas, Lamas, Tusi (local chieftains), and headmen, have participated in government and CPPCC (Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference) work at all levels. According to statistics, the number of them participating in government and CPPCC work is now more than double that of last year.

In the Tibetan and Yi areas, due to the development of the united front, most of the leading figures from all ethnic groups in these areas have gradually participated in work since liberation, holding leading positions in the state, county, and district governments. Currently, all of the more than 1,000 upper-class figures in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture have participated in work, and the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture had more than 1,000 people participating in work before the end of last year, which has now increased to more than 2,500.

In addition to assigning appropriate jobs to upper-class figures who are willing to work, local people's governments have also provided assistance to many who have not yet participated in work.

These upper-class figures have made many contributions to various tasks in minority areas. They often offer suggestions on government work and publicize and explain policies to relatives and family members. During this year's democratic reforms, many people actively took the lead in implementing the government's peaceful reform policies and persuaded family members and relatives to abide by the law. In the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, more than 2,000 Tusi and headmen organized several inspection teams and work groups to inspect democratic reforms and agricultural production work in various counties, resolving many problems in the work.

    四川少数民族地区扩大统一战线
　　许多上层人士参加政权工作
    据新华社讯　今年以来，四川省各少数民族地区数以千计的各民族上层人士包括活佛、喇嘛、土司和头人等，参加了各级政权和政协工作。据统计，他们参加政权和政协工作的人数，现在比去年增加了一倍以上。
    在藏族和彝族聚居的地区，由于统一战线得到了发展，这些地区的各族上层人士领袖人物，从解放以来就已经大部陆续参加工作，担任了州、县、区各级政权的领导职务，目前，甘孜藏族自治州的一千多上层人士已经全部参加工作，凉山彝族自治州在去年年底以前参加工作的有一千多人，现在已经增加到二千五百多人。
    各地人民政府除了对愿意参加工作的上层人士已尽量使他们担任了适当的工作以外，还对许多未参加工作的人在生活上给以帮助。
    在少数民族地区的各项工作中，这些上层人士作出了许多贡献。他们经常对政府工作提出各方面的建议，向亲友、家人宣传解释政策。在今年的民主改革中，许多人积极带头执行政府的和平改革政策，劝导家人亲友守法。凉山彝族自治州还有二千多土司、头人等，组织了好些个视察团和工作组，到各县去视察民主改革和农业生产工作，解决了不少工作中的问题。
