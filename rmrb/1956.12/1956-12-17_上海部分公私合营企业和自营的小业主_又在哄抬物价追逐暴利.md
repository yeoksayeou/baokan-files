(Dispatch from our newspaper in Shanghai, December 16th) Recently, with the activity in the Shanghai market and the tight supply of certain materials, some joint state-private enterprises and self-employed small business owners in Shanghai have once again exhibited capitalist management styles of driving up prices, passing off inferior goods as quality ones, and pursuing exorbitant profits. This has caused losses to consumers and created artificial tension in the market.

This situation is most severe in industries where goods are in short supply. For example, due to difficulties in the supply of pig iron this year, stoves were once out of stock, and the price of stoves in the market quickly soared. A used stove weighing 180 *jin* (approximately 90 kg) would normally be worth about 100 *yuan* at market prices, but some self-employed vendors in the secondhand market were asking as much as 550 *yuan*. A small, basket-style stove, which would normally be worth only about 20 *yuan*, was being sold for 75 *yuan* each by the He Xing Biao Stove Store in the Changshu District of Shanghai. In the Xue Tang Wan area of Caojiadu in Shanghai, there is a group of itinerant merchants who travel back and forth to rural Zhejiang, specializing in used building materials. Recently, due to the shortage of building materials in the market, their speculative and profiteering practices have become even more serious, with some illegally obtained profits reaching as high as eight to nine times the original cost. Generally, the profit margins are two to three times the original cost. For example, used tiles originally cost about 7 *yuan* per thousand, but they sometimes raise the price to 15 *yuan*, and at the highest, to 23 *yuan* (the listed price is only 9.5 *yuan* per thousand). A merchant named Cao Dapeng bought 257 *dan* (approximately 50 kg) of old wood in Lanxi, Zhejiang, at a low price of 1.5 to 2 *yuan* per *dan*, and after transporting it to Shanghai, he raised the price to 8.5 *yuan* per *dan* to sell to peddlers, who then made a net profit of 2,000 *yuan* when reselling it.

The Shanghai Central Market, which has always been known for selling high-end consumer goods, put up joint state-private operation signs throughout the entire market during the high tide of joint state-private ventures last year. However, in the past year, it has not undergone any significant transformation. Recently, due to the hot sales of used Western suits in the market, the suit shops in the market, under the guise of joint state-private operation, adopted a so-called "buy-out" method for used Western suits from various secondhand stores in the city. As soon as a relatively new suit appears, it is immediately snapped up by them. After slight alterations, they sell it with a 30% profit margin. Not long ago, the Shanghai Municipal Company of the China Department Store wholesaled a batch of high-end plastic soap boxes to several department stores in Shanghai, and the retail price of each soap box in the joint state-private stores was 1.5 *yuan*. After hearing this, a group of vendors in the Central Market bought up all the soap boxes from various stores and immediately sold them to consumers at a price of 2.4 *yuan*.

While driving up prices, some enterprises have also displayed the bad practice of passing off inferior goods as quality ones. Pan Zhiliang, a private sector employee of the joint state-private Sen Kang Instrument Factory, took advantage of the tight supply of thermometers in the market to buy back more than 13,000 discarded glass tubes from other factories at a low price of 3 *fen* per tube. He then hired a group of unskilled temporary workers to reprocess them and sold them to the market for 6.5 *jiao* per tube, regardless of their accuracy. The quality of these thermometers is extremely poor, and often the temperature differs by several degrees at the same time and place. Recently, due to the tight supply of milk powder and milk, some food shops and stalls selling milk have also exhibited dishonest business practices. The Beijing Milk House not only privately raised the price of fresh milk uniformly distributed by the state, but also sold milk that had not been sterilized as sterilized milk, deceiving customers. Chen Junyi, a private sector employee of the joint state-private Hua Dong Ribbon Factory, recently sold a batch of substandard ribbon blanks as genuine goods on the market, and the price was even higher than the genuine goods. In the past two months, many citizens have reported that the *dabing* (large flatbread) has become smaller and the fried dough sticks have become thinner. According to a survey of 52 *dabing* stores in the Xincheng District, 20 of them were found to be selling underweight *dabing* and fried dough sticks, deducting an average of about 3 *liang* (approximately 150 grams) of flour per *jin* (approximately 500 grams). It is common to see disputes between buyers and sellers in the market due to non-standard *youtiao* and *dabing*.

Recently, the speculative activities of brokers in the Shanghai market have also been revived. Some of them are former middlemen who have been assigned jobs by the state, and some are vendors. They buy up goods in the market, drive up prices, engage in deceptive transactions, and obtain astonishing profits in resale. For example, the middleman Ji Akang bought a planer for a low price of 700 *yuan* (only a partial deposit was paid) and immediately sold it in a teahouse for 1,400 *yuan*. Not long ago, the Shanghai commercial departments also discovered that a small number of brokers were manipulating the local yarn and local yarn gloves in the Shanghai market. They collected commissions and also raised the selling price of gloves from 3.7 *yuan* per dozen to 4 *yuan*. Recently, some brokers who have been assigned to work in state-owned companies have left their current jobs and resumed their old trade, or work in state-owned companies during the day and engage in speculative activities as brokers at night. Another phenomenon that deserves attention is that recently, cases of some private sector employees and small business owners embezzling enterprise funds or engaging in private life corruption and degeneration have also developed. The Office of the CPC Zhabei District Committee recently inspected eight joint state-private factories and five commercial district stores and found that there were four households with a total of seven people involved in embezzlement. A small number of private sector employees have been sentenced to prison by the state for embezzlement and corruption.

These bad tendencies that have appeared in the Shanghai market have aroused dissatisfaction among the general public and have been unanimously condemned by the media. The Shanghai *Liberation Daily*, *Xinwen Daily*, and *Xinmin Evening News* have recently exposed these incidents several times and have called on the government's industrial and commercial administrative departments to strengthen the management of the market; they have also called on industrialists and businesspeople themselves to better raise their awareness and overcome the old bourgeois ideology and practices.

    上海部分公私合营企业和自营的小业主
    又在哄抬物价追逐暴利
    本报上海16日电　最近，随着上海市场的活跃和某些物资供应的紧张，上海一部分公私合营企业和自营的小业主，又出现了哄抬售价、以坏当好、追逐暴利的资本主义经营作风，使消费者蒙受损失，并使市场上形成人为的紧张。
    这种情形较严重的，大都在货源紧张的行业。例如：今年生铁来源困难，火炉曾一度断档，市场上火炉价格便迅速猛涨。一个重一百八十斤的旧火炉，按照市场价格只值一百元左右，但在旧货市场上一些自营摊贩竟讨价五百五十元；一个小型花篮式火炉，按照通常的价格只值二十多元，但上海常熟区合兴标火炉商店却标售七十五元一个。在上海曹家渡学堂湾一带，有一批水上行商，他们来往浙江农村一带专营旧的建筑材料，近来因为市场建筑材料紧张，投机取巧，贪图暴利的作风更为严重，非法攫取的利润有的竟高达八倍到九倍。一般也在二倍到三倍。如旧瓦片本来每千张约七元，但他们有时哄抬到十五元，最高时哄抬到二十三元（牌价每千张不过九元五角）。一个名叫曹大鹏的商人在浙江兰溪以每担一元半到二元的低价买进旧木料二百五十七担，运到上海后抬高到八元五角一担卖给小贩，小贩在出售时又净赚了两千元。
    一向以出售高级消费品著名的上海中央市场，在去年合营高潮时，整个商场挂上了合营招牌。但近一年来，并没有经过什么改造。最近一个时期，因市场上旧西装热销，商场中的西装商店就借公私合营的头衔，对市内各旧货商店的旧西装采取了所谓“包下来”的方法。只要一有较新的西装出现，马上就被他们抢购一空。然后略加整理，转手间就加30％的利润出售。不久前，中国百货公司上海市公司曾批发给上海市若干百货商店一批高档塑胶皂盒，合营商店零售价格每只是一元五角。中央商场一批摊贩闻讯后，将各商店的皂盒搜购一空，旋即以两元四角的价格售给消费者。
    在哄抬物价的同时，在一部分企业中还出现了以坏充好的恶劣作风。公私合营森康仪器厂私方人员潘芝良，趁着市场上寒暑表供应紧张的时候，将其他工厂报废的一万三千多根玻璃管子，以三分钱一根的低价买回后，请了一批不熟练的临时工重新加工，不管准确与否，每根以六角五分的价格向市场抛售。这种寒暑表质量极坏，常常在同一时间，同一地点温度相差几度。最近因为奶粉和牛奶供应紧张，部分出售牛奶的饮食店和饮食摊也出现了不老实的经营作风。北京牛奶房不但私自抬高国营统一配售的鲜奶价格，而且将没有经过消毒处理的牛奶充当消毒牛奶出售，蒙混顾客。公私合营华东织带厂私方人员陈君毅，最近将一批次货带坯充当正号货出售到市场上，而价格还比正号货贵。最近两个月来，不少的市民反映：大饼变小了，油条变瘦了。据新成区五十二家大饼店检查结果证明：其中有二十家卖的大饼、油条份量不足，平均每斤面粉克扣三两左右，在市场上经常能够看到因为油条和大饼不合规格，买卖双方发生争执的事件。
    近来，上海市场上掮客的投机活动也随着重新活跃起来了。他们有的是已得到国家安排的过去的中间商人，有的是商贩。他们在市场上套购商品，哄抬物价，进行欺骗性的交易，转手间即获惊人的暴利。如中间商季阿康，用七百元的低价购进一架刨床（只付了部分定钱），随即在茶楼上以一千四百元抛出。不久前，上海商业部门还发现有少数掮客操纵了上海市场的土纱和土纱手套，他们即提取佣金，又将手套的售价以每打三元七角提高到四元。最近有一些已经被安排到国营公司工作的掮客，离开现在的工作岗位，重操旧业，或者白天在国营公司工作，夜间从事掮客投机活动。值得注意的另一种现象是：近来某些私方人员和小业主贪污企业资金或私人生活腐化堕落的事情，也有了发展。中共闸北区委办公室最近检查了八个公私合营工厂、五个商业区店，发现有贪污行为的有四户共七个人。有少数私方人员已因贪污、腐化被国家判处了徒刑。
    上海市场上出现的这种不良倾向，引起了广大市民的不满，受到了舆论界一致的谴责。上海解放日报、新闻日报、新民晚报，近来曾数次揭露了这些事件，并要求政府工商行政部门加强对市场的管理工作；要求工商业者本身更好地提高觉悟，克服资产阶级旧思想旧作风。
