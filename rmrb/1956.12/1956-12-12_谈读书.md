    On Reading
  　Huang Wu
    In "Chronicles of the Book Forest" there is this entry:
    "Li Gongze often read books at the White Stone Monk's Abode in Lushan when he was young. After passing the imperial examination, he left behind the nine thousand scrolls he had copied, naming the place the 'Li Family Mountain Study.'"
    Li Gongze was a man of the Northern Song Dynasty, and somewhat related to the poet Huang Shangu. When he left Lushan to become an official in Kaifeng, he donated all his collection of books for people to read. His friend Su Shi wrote an essay for this called "Record of Books Stored at Li's Mountain Study".
    During the Song Dynasty, because printing was difficult and good books were rare, people who read often had to hand-copy them. When Su Shi was young, he copied all the classics and histories he read. Today, we can still buy engraved copies of his hand-copied poems of Tao Qian in old bookstores. But Li Gongze copied as many as nine thousand scrolls, such perseverance and diligent spirit is truly admirable. Therefore, at the end of his essay, Su Shi couldn't help but exclaim with emotion: "To let those who come after know how difficult it was for the gentlemen of the past to see books, and that it is a pity that scholars today have books but do not read them."
    Su Shi's words have stirred some of my emotions.
    This summer, I went to Lushan for recuperation. Before leaving, an editor asked me to write something like travel notes. Since the task was assigned, I had to make some preparations. So I picked a few books about Lushan and took them with me, so that I could browse them on the way. Unexpectedly, after getting on the bus, I realized that I had forgotten to put "The Travels of Xu Xiake" in my handbag. Fortunately, it wasn't a rare book, I thought I could borrow one in Hankou.
    When I arrived in Hankou, I went to a friend's house to borrow a book. My friend is a writer, who has gone down to experience life. His wife took me to his study and let me find it myself. But this study surprised me greatly. There was only one bookshelf, the kind we often see, made of wooden strips, half a person tall, with four layers up and down. The top layer had a few political and economic readings, the bottom layer was piled with stacks of newspapers and magazines, and about literature, apart from a set of "Chinese People's Literature and Art Series," there were only ten or so newly published creative and translated novels, even the middle two layers were not full. That was all! It was clear at a glance, what was there to find! Surprised and disappointed, I asked her if he usually borrowed books from the library or data room. She smiled and said, "Read books! He is busy all day long, even with meetings and reports. Even those few books on the bookshelf, I'm afraid he hasn't read them carefully."
    I ran to another friend's house to borrow a book. Compared to the first one's study, this writer's was much more decent. There were three or four glass bookshelves alone. But I was still disappointed. Because standing in those bookshelves, seven or eight out of ten were foreign writers, from Shakespeare to Nikolaeva, truly filling a room. There were not many Chinese writers to begin with, and even fewer ancient ones, even Qu Yuan, Sima Qian, and Du Fu were not represented, let alone a small Xu Xiake! It turned out that this friend didn't read thread-bound books much.
    After returning from Lushan, it was just in time for the commemoration of Mr. Lu Xun. Because I accompanied foreign guests on a visit, I was able to take a closer look at Mr. Lu Xun's collection of books. Recently, I reread his essays, and I deeply felt the breadth of his knowledge. When reading his works, I naturally thought of his box after box of books, shelf after shelf of books, and I also naturally associated them with my two friends.
    Writers who do not read much or do not read Chinese books much, I am afraid, are not limited to these two. This can be known by visiting the studies of writers.
    The fact that people who write books for others to read do not read books written by others is a bit strange in itself. And what is even stranger is that we are not surprised, but instead say "Creation, as long as you go down to experience life, everything else doesn't matter," and that "Lu Xun once advised people not to read Chinese books."
    I doubt that a person who does not read much can write truly good works; and that a person who does not humbly learn from his own excellent literary tradition can become a true Chinese writer.

    谈读书
  　荒芜
    “书林纪事”里有这样一条：
    “李公择常少读书庐山白石僧舍。既擢第，留所抄书九千卷，名其舍曰李氏山房。”
    李公择是北宋时人，和诗人黄山谷还有点亲戚。他离开庐山到开封去做官的时候，把藏书全部捐了出来，供人阅览。他的朋友苏轼曾为此写过一篇“李氏山房藏书记”。
    宋代大约因为刻书不易，好书难得，读书的人常得手抄。苏轼自己小时，就曾把他读的经史抄过一通。今天我们在旧书店里也还能买到他手抄的陶诗刻本。但李公择抄书竟多到九千卷，那种毅力，那种勤学的精神实在令人钦佩。所以苏轼在他写的那篇文章的结尾处，也不禁感慨系之地说：“使来者知昔之君子见书之难，而今之学者有书而不读为可惜也。”
    苏轼的话很引起我的一些感触来。
    今年夏天，我到庐山去休养。临走以前，一位编辑同志要我写点游记之类的东西。任务既然指定下来，总得作点准备。于是我就拣了几本有关庐山的书，带在身边，以便路上翻阅。不料上车之后，才发现原来打算带的一本“徐霞客游记”竟忘了放进手提包里。幸好那并不是什么稀罕书，我想，到汉口借一本也就是了。
    到了汉口，我就去找朋友借书。朋友是个作家，下去体验生活去了。他的爱人把我带进他的书房，让我自己去找。可是这间书房却使我大吃一惊了。统共只有一个书架，就是我们常见的，用木条条钉了起来、半人高、上下四层的那一种。上一层放了几本政治、经济读物，下一层堆着几叠报纸杂志，关于文学的，除一套“中国人民文艺丛书”之外，只有十来本新出的创作和翻译小说，连中间两层都没摆满。如此而已！一目了然，有什么可找的呢！吃惊和失望之余，我就问她，是不是他平常看的都是从图书馆或资料室借的书。她笑着说：“看书！他一天到晚，连开会和报告还忙不过来哩。就是书架上那几本，恐怕他也没有好好看过。”
    我又跑到另一个朋友家里去借。比起那一位的书房来，这一位作家的可像样得多了。光是玻璃书橱就有三、四个。可是我得到的仍然是失望。因为站在那些书橱里的，十之七八是外国作家，从莎士比亚到尼古拉耶娃，真是济济一房。中国作家本就不多，古代的尤少，连屈原、司马迁、杜甫都还没有份儿呢，更谈不到一个小小的徐霞客了！原来这位朋友是不大读线装书的。
    从庐山回来，正赶上鲁迅先生的纪念会。我因为陪外宾参观，得以细看鲁迅先生的藏书。最近，我又重读了他的杂文，我深感他的学识之渊博。读着他的作品的时候，便很自然地想起他那一箱又一箱的书，一橱又一橱的书，也很自然地联想起我的两位朋友。
    不大读书或不大读中国书的作家，恐怕尚不止于他们两位。这只要去参观一下作家们的书房，大约就可以知道。
    写书给别人读的人，自己却不去读别人写的书，这件事本身便有点古怪。而更古怪的是见怪不怪，反而说什么“创作嘛，只要下去体验一下生活就行了，其他都不关紧要”，说什么“鲁迅就曾劝人不要读中国书。”
    一个读书不多的人，能写出真正的好作品；一个不虚心向自己的优秀文学传统学习的人，能成为一个真正的中国的作家；我怀疑。
