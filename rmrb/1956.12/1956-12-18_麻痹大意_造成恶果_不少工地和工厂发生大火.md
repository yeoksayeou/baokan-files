    Carelessness Leads to Disastrous Results
    Many Construction Sites and Factories Experience Major Fires

    (Our report) Recently, several important construction sites and factories in Henan, Shanxi, Gansu, Hebei, and other provinces have experienced fires, resulting in significant losses. On December 13th alone, the Lanzhou Knitting Company's processing department, the Fourth Construction Company's mechanical team, and the Handicraft Production Cooperative's joint sewing factory in Lanzhou successively experienced three major fires, with total losses exceeding one million yuan. On November 15th, a fire broke out at the kiln tail workshop construction site, one of the main buildings of the newly built Yongdeng Cement Plant in Gansu, destroying some of the newly installed mechanized and automated equipment. On the 16th, a major fire broke out at the construction site of the new Datong Power Plant in Shanxi, destroying 7,500 square meters of factory buildings that were nearing completion, as well as construction equipment such as the No. 6 generator and a tower crane. Five firefighters and twenty-three employees were burned during the firefighting. On the 21st, a fire broke out in the machine room at the Sanmenxia Yellow River construction site, destroying four generators and ten air compressors. On the 24th, a fire broke out in the small rolling mill workshop of the Taiyuan Steel Plant, completely burning down the workshop. Due to the destruction of electrical equipment, the thin plate factory was also forced to shut down, reducing steel production by more than 300 tons.
    The fundamental reason for these major fires is the neglect of fire prevention work by enterprise leaders. The Datong Power Plant, which is under intensive construction, used mats and straw curtains for insulation, posing a serious fire hazard. However, the construction site leaders did not seriously educate the workers about fire prevention, nor did they take effective fire prevention measures. Finally, on the afternoon of the 16th, sparks from welding ignited the insulation straw curtains, causing a major loss. The Lanzhou Knitting Company's factory buildings, warehouses, and family dormitories were crowded together, and there was a lack of fire prevention management, posing a significant fire hazard. The local public security organs had suggested improvements four times, but the company leaders consistently ignored them. On the 13th, a worker adding coal to a stove caused sparks to fly out and ignite cotton, burning down the processing department, the entire warehouse, and parts of the offices and family dormitories. The indoor temperature of the small rolling mill workshop of the Taiyuan Steel Plant was very high, but the factory building was of brick and wood construction, posing a significant fire hazard. The public security and fire departments had repeatedly suggested improving fire prevention work. The day before the major fire, the workshop had caught fire twice, but because the fires were extinguished promptly, they did not become major. However, the workshop负责人 (fuzeren - person in charge) thought the matter was over, and neither reported it to higher authorities nor took effective preventive measures, resulting in an irreparable serious consequence.

    麻痹大意　造成恶果
    不少工地和工厂发生大火
    本报讯　最近以来，河南、山西、甘肃、河北等省有一些重要工地和工厂，发生了火灾，损失重大。12月13日一天以内兰州市针织品公司加工部、第四建筑公司机械队和手工业生产合作社联合缝纫厂相继发生三次大火，损失总值一百余万元。新建的甘肃永登水泥厂主要厂房之一的窑尾厂房工地11月15日失火，新安装的部分机械化自动化设备被烧毁。16日，山西大同发电厂新建的工程工地大火，即将完工的七千五百平方公尺的厂房建筑被烧毁，六号发电机和塔式起重机等建筑设备也被烧毁。救火中烧伤消防员五名，职工二十三人。21日黄河三门峡工地机房失火，四台发电机、十台空气压缩机被烧毁。24日，太原钢厂小型轧钢车间发生火灾，车间全部烧光；因电力设备被烧，薄板厂也被迫停工，减产钢材三百多吨。
    企业领导方面忽视防火工作是造成大火的基本原因。正在紧张施工中的大同电厂采用席子、草帘保温，火灾危险十分严重，但工地领导人不认真对工人进行防火教育，也不采取有效的消防措施，终于在16日下午焊接时，火星溅落在保温草帘上起火，造成重大损失。兰州市针织品公司的厂房、仓库和家属宿舍拥挤一起，而又缺乏防火管理，火灾危险很大，当地公安机关曾四次建议加以改善，但公司领导始终置之不理。13日一工人往火炉中添煤时迸出的火星烧着棉花，将加工部、整个仓库和部分办公室、家属宿舍烧光。太原钢厂小型轧钢车间室内热度很高，但厂房是砖木结构，火险很大，公安消防机关曾多次建议改进防火工作。在发生大火前一天，该车间就起火两次，因扑救及时，没有烧大。但车间负责人以为事情已经过去，既不向上报告，也没有采取有效的预防措施，以致造成无法挽救的严重后果。
