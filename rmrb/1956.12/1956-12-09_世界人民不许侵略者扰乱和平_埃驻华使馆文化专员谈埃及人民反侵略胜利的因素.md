Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: Egyptian Embassy Cultural Attaché to China, Badran, stated this afternoon at a mass rally in Beijing: “The ships of the British and French troops that invaded Egypt are now returning, laden with their wounded and crippled, searching for hospitals in various ports of the Mediterranean.” This statement elicited enthusiastic applause and laughter from the more than 1,200 audience members present.

At this gathering, Badran reported to people from all walks of life in the capital on the heroic resistance of the Egyptian people against the British and French aggressors. He said that Eden and Mollet originally thought that the British and French Allied Forces could occupy Egypt with a relaxed "trip" of only twenty-four hours. Their fantasy has been shattered. The aggressors have seen the Egyptian people rise up as one, like lions, to defend their motherland. In the face of the enemy's attacks, every Egyptian confidently carried out their work. In the face of the strength of the Egyptian people, the enemy appeared powerless.

Badran said that Britain and France, countries claiming to be world powers, have now finally been forced to withdraw their troops from Egypt. He said that the reason the Egyptian people achieved this victory was because of the support of the people of Arab countries, peace-loving people of all countries in the world, and the Chinese people. This support and friendship encouraged the brave spirit of the Egyptian people and made them stronger in resisting oppression and enslavement. He said that Egypt firmly believes that peace-loving people all over the world will never allow Britain and France to disrupt world peace with their criminal aggression.

Badran's speech was constantly interrupted by loud applause.

This report meeting was organized by the Sino-Egyptian Friendship Association. After the meeting, the Egyptian film "Rananaib" was also screened.

　　世界人民不许侵略者扰乱和平
　　埃驻华使馆文化专员谈埃及人民反侵略胜利的因素
    新华社8日讯　埃及驻华大使馆文化专员巴德朗今天下午在北京的一个群众集会上说：“侵略埃及的英法军队的船只现在已经载着他们的伤兵和残废者返回去，他们正在地中海的各港口寻找医院。”他的这段话引起到会的一千二百多名听众的热烈掌声和笑声。
    在这次集会上，巴德朗向首都各界人民报告了埃及人民英勇抗击英法侵略者经过。他说，艾登和摩勒原想英法联军只要作个二十四小时的轻松“旅行”，就能占领埃及。他们的这种幻想破灭了。侵略者已经看到埃及人民万众一心像雄狮般地起来保卫自己的祖国。在敌人的进攻面前，每个埃及人都有信心地作着自己的工作。在埃及人民的力量面前，敌人显得无能为力。
    巴德朗说，号称世界强国的英法两国现在终于被迫从埃及撤军。他说，埃及人民所以获得这个胜利，是因为有阿拉伯国家人民、世界各国爱好和平的人民以及中国人民的支持，这种支持和友谊鼓舞了埃及人民的勇敢精神，使他们更坚强地去反抗压迫和奴役。他说，埃及完全坚信，全世界爱好和平的人民绝不会让英法两个国家，以罪恶的侵略来扰乱世界和平。
    巴德朗的讲话不断为响亮的掌声所打断。
    这次报告会是由中埃友好协会主办的。会后还放映了埃及电影“然娜布”。
