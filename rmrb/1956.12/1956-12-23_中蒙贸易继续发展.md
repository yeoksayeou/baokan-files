Sino-Mongolian Trade Continues to Develop
Gao Jingsheng

The Sino-Mongolian trade negotiations for 1957 have concluded in a sincere and friendly atmosphere, and a protocol on the mutual supply of goods for 1957 was signed in Beijing on December 22nd. This marks another important measure for China and Mongolia to exchange goods and assist each other through trade, seeking the common economic development of the two countries, and signifies further close cooperation between the two economies.

According to the protocol, the volume of Sino-Mongolian trade in 1957 will increase compared to 1956, and the variety of goods mutually supplied will also increase accordingly with the economic development and improvement of people's lives in both countries. Next year, Mongolia will supply China with materials such as horses, wool, cashmere, various hides, casings, antlers, bones, etc. Some of these materials are industrial raw materials needed by China, and some are daily necessities favored by the Chinese people. In particular, the 40,000 strong and powerful draught horses that Mongolia will supply to China are welcomed by the vast number of Chinese farmers. If these 40,000 horses are used in the North China region to pull double-wheeled double-furrow plows, they can cultivate 2.4 million mu of land each year; if they are all used for animal-powered transportation, they can transport 140 million ton-kilometers of goods each year. This is of practical significance given that the conditions for widespread use of machinery in cultivating land in China's vast rural areas are not yet available and that China's transportation needs to be strengthened in all aspects.

If we add the 40,000 horses that Mongolia will supply to China next year to the number of horses that Mongolia has supplied to China in recent years, the total will be as high as 155,000 horses. If all these horses are used in agriculture, pulling double-wheeled double-furrow plows, they can cultivate 9.3 million mu of land each year in the North China region.

In 1957, Mongolia will supply China with 227,500 various hides. In addition, Mongolia has supplied China with a total of 950,700 hides in the past. In addition, Mongolia also supplies China with down, antlers, horse tails and other commodities.

Next year, China will supply Mongolia with silk, cloth, fruits, machinery, machine tools, building materials, chemical medicines, vegetable seeds, and a large number of daily necessities. These materials include raw materials, tools, and seeds needed for Mongolia's agricultural and livestock production and agricultural and sideline production, as well as daily necessities favored by the Mongolian people, especially some items that the Mongolian people are traditionally accustomed to using. The supply of the above materials will play a certain role in helping Mongolia develop its national economy and improve people's lives.

As in the past, the two countries' trade negotiations were conducted on the basis of socialist fraternal relations, based on equality, mutual benefit, friendly cooperation, and taking into account both needs and difficulties. Therefore, throughout the negotiations, whether it was the variety and quantity of goods mutually supplied or the technical conditions and pricing, everything was determined after sincere and frank exchange of views. The negotiations were always filled with an atmosphere of unity, friendship and harmony.

China and Mongolia are close fraternal neighbors, and the people of the two countries have a profound friendship. In the future, with the rapid development of the two countries' economic construction, Sino-Mongolian trade will be further developed on the existing basis.

    中蒙贸易继续发展
    高竞生
    中蒙1957年的贸易谈判，已经在诚挚友好的气氛中结束，并于12月22日在北京签订了1957年互相供应货物的议定书。这是中蒙两国通过贸易方式，互通有无，互相帮助，求得两国经济共同发展的又一个重要的措施，它标志着两国经济的进一步的密切合作。
    根据议定书规定，1957年中蒙贸易额较1956年有所增加，相互供应的品种，也随着中蒙两国经济发展和人民生活的提高而相应地增多了。明年蒙古供应我国的物资，有马匹、羊毛、羊绒、各种皮张、肠衣、鹿角、骨类等，这些物资有的是我国所需要的工业原料，有的是我国人民所喜爱的生活日用品，特别是蒙古供应我国的四万匹精强力壮的耕马，更为我国广大农民所欢迎。这四万匹马，如用在华北地区牵引双轮双铧犁，则每年可以耕种二百四十万亩土地；如全部用在畜力运输方面，每年可运输货物一亿四千万吨公里，这在我国广大农村目前广泛利用机器耕种土地的条件还不具备和我国运输还须从各方面加强的情况下，是具有现实意义的。
    蒙古明年供应我们的四万匹马，如加上蒙古近几年来供应我国的马匹数量，总共有十五万五千匹之多，这些马匹全部供农业方面使用，牵引双轮双铧犁，则每年在华北地区可以耕种九百三十万亩面积的土地。
    1957年蒙古供应我国的各种皮张有二十二万七千五百张，加上过去蒙古供应我国的皮张共计为九十五万零七百张。此外蒙古还供应我国绒毛、鹿角、马尾等商品。
    明年我国供应蒙古的物资，有绸缎、布匹、水果、机器、机器工具、建筑材料、化工医药、蔬菜种籽和大批日用百货等。这些物资，有蒙古农牧业和农牧副业生产所需要的原料、工具、种籽，也有为蒙古人民所喜爱的日用品，尤其是一些蒙古人民所传统习惯使用的东西。上述物资的供应，对于帮助蒙古发展国民经济和改善人民生活是会起一定作用的。
    这次两国的贸易谈判仍和过去一样，双方是在社会主义兄弟国家关系的基础上，根据平等互利、友好合作和既相互照顾需要，而又相互照顾了困难的情况下进行的，因而在整个谈判中，不管是互供货物的品种数量或技术条件以及作价等方面，都是经过诚恳坦率、充分交换意见后确定的。谈判始终洋溢着团结友好和融洽的气氛。
    中蒙两国是亲近的兄弟邻邦，两国人民有着深厚的友谊。今后，随着两国经济建设迅速的发展，中蒙两国的贸易将会在现有的基础上得到更进一步的发展。
