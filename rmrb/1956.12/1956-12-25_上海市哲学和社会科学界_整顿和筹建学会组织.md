Shanghai Philosophical and Social Science Circles
    Rectify and Prepare to Establish Academic Organizations
    (Our Report) In order to adapt to the needs of future scientific research work, the philosophical and social science circles in Shanghai have universally rectified and prepared to establish academic organizations.
    After liberation, Shanghai established quite a few mass academic organizations. However, some have seen their leading bodies become virtually inactive, while others have experienced significant personnel changes, which has affected the further development of their work. In the fields of law, education, foreign literature, and international issues, there were previously no academic organizations. After the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Philosophical and Social Science Academic Committee was established in February this year, with its assistance, the philosophical and social science circles in Shanghai have been carrying out the work of rectifying and preparing for the establishment of academic organizations since August.
    The original Shanghai Branch of the China New Philosophy Research Association decided to change its name to the Shanghai Philosophical Society because the general association no longer existed and there had been significant personnel changes. It plans to be formally established in January next year. The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Historical Society currently has more than eighty members. After rectification, it has held a forum on "How to Implement the 'Hundred Flowers Bloom' Policy in the Field of Historical Science." The association has decided to hold an academic report or discussion meeting once a month in the future and is preparing to hold a discussion on the periodization of ancient Chinese history soon. The Shanghai Branch of the China New Economic Research Association currently has more than three hundred members. Since September, it has organized three discussion meetings on "The Role of the Law of Value in the Transition Period in Our Country." The association is scheduled to re-elect a new leading body in December and plans to rename itself the "Shanghai Economic Society." The original China New Language Workers Association has been abolished since the establishment of the Chinese Language Reform Committee, and the Shanghai Linguistics Society has been established on its original basis. It has also formulated a work plan for September 1956 to August 1957, which will include organizing special discussion meetings and special report meetings, as well as organizing lectures on linguistics. The monthly magazine "Language Knowledge" is also sponsored by the association. The preparatory committee of the Shanghai Educational Science Society and the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Foreign Literature Society have also been established. These societies are currently soliciting basic members and are expected to be formally established in February next year. The preparatory committee of the Shanghai Law Society has now absorbed more than two hundred and eighty members and is expected to be formally established by the end of the year. The preparatory committee of the Shanghai International Issues Research Association will also be formally established soon.
    The rectification and successive establishment of various societies will be able to unite philosophical and social science workers more widely and strengthen their mutual connections and exchange of ideas. This will promote the prosperity of scientific research work. However, the work of some societies is still not progressing much. In the future, how each society can unite scholars to carry out regular activities in its own work, and how to better play the role of the society, is a matter of great concern to the academic community.

    上海市哲学和社会科学界
    整顿和筹建学会组织
    本报讯　为了适应今后科学研究工作的需要，上海市哲学社会科学界普遍整顿和筹建了学会的组织。
    解放后，上海曾经建立了不少群众性的学术团体。但是有的因为领导机构无形停顿，有的因为人员变动较大，这就影响到工作的进一步开展。而在法学、教育学、外国文学和国际问题等方面，以往并无学会组织。今年2月上海市哲学社会科学学术委员会筹备委员会成立后，在该会的协助下，上海市哲学社会科学界自8月份以来，都已分别进行了整顿和筹建学会工作。
    原中国新哲学研究会上海分会，因总会已不存在、人员变动又大，决定改为上海哲学学会，拟在明年1月份正式成立。中国史学会上海分会现有会员八十余人，经过整顿后，已举行过“历史科学领域内如何贯彻百家争鸣方针”座谈会。该会决定今后每月举行一次学术报告会或讨论会，并准备最近举行中国古代史分期问题的讨论。中国新经济研究会上海分会，现有会员三百余人，自9月份以来，组织了三次“价值规律在我国过渡时期的作用”讨论会。该会定于12月份改选新的领导机构，并拟改名“上海经济学会”。原中国新文字工作者协会，自中国文字改革委员会成立后，已经撤销，而在原有基础上成立了上海语文学会。并已制定了1956年9月至1957年8月的工作计划，即将组织专题讨论会和专题报告会，以及组织关于语言学方面的讲座。“语文知识”月刊亦为该会主办。上海教育学学会筹委会和上海外文学会筹委会也已建立。这些学会目前正在分别征求基本会员，预定明年2月份可以正式成立。上海法学会筹备委员会，现已吸收会员二百八十余人，预计年底即可正式成立。上海国际问题研究会筹备委员会，不久亦将正式成立。
    各学会的整顿和相继建立，将能比较广泛地团结哲学和社会科学的工作者，并能加强他们彼此间的联系，交流心得。这将会促进科学研究工作的繁荣。但是，目前有些学会的工作还是进展不大的。今后各学会在自己的工作中如何团结学者们展开经常活动，以及如何更好地发挥学会的作用，乃是学术界至为关心的问题。　　（胡香凤）
