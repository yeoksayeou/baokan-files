Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, December 27th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Lei Benfu reports): In the first year of realizing agricultural cooperativization, the per unit area yield of grain and oil crops in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region exceeded any previous year in history. According to statistics from the Autonomous Region's Department of Agriculture, the average yield of grain per mu in the region this year has reached 134 jin, exceeding the average of 121 jin per mu in 1954, a year of great harvest. Compared to the average yield of 76 jin per mu in 1950, it has increased by nearly one time. The increase in per unit area yield of grain has enabled the region's total grain output this year to exceed the planned target for 1957. The average yield of oil crops per mu this year is also 6% higher than in 1954. Inner Mongolia is one of the three major beet producing areas in China, and this year many agricultural cooperatives have seen large areas of high-yielding beet fields producing over 10,000 jin per mu.

This year, the region expanded its irrigated area by 3 million mu, more than double the increase of last year; the area of fertilizer application accounted for 59.1% of the total cultivated land area, also doubling the increase of last year. In terms of improving cultivation techniques, all localities, based on the characteristics of drought, universally adopted a series of drought-resistant measures from the winter of 1955, such as seizing the time for planting, watering and spot-planting, weeding, and protecting seedlings. In particular, the promotion of autumn plowing, improving the quality of autumn plowing, and promoting the reduction of ridges, increasing rows, even sowing, and close planting have been very effective. In addition, some areas have also used insecticides on large areas of cultivated land and promoted a large number of new farm tools and improved varieties. All these measures have played a significant role in increasing per unit area yield.

The history of agriculture in Inner Mongolia is short, with most farmland having been reclaimed for less than a hundred years. The accumulation of agricultural technology and experience is relatively poor. In the decades before liberation, the reactionary rulers implemented a predatory reclamation policy and cruel feudal exploitation here, as well as the devastation by the Japanese and puppet regimes during the Anti-Japanese War, which resulted in the vast number of poor peasants engaging in production with a long-term practice of extensive cultivation with low yields. Therefore, the characteristics of agriculture in Inner Mongolia were a shortage of labor, extensive cultivation, many natural disasters, and low per unit area yield. After liberation, especially since agricultural cooperativization, the peasants of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have vigorously changed the backward state of agricultural production left over by history.

    内蒙古粮食油料单位面积产量空前提高
    合作化使历史上遗留下的农业生产落后状况大大改变
    新华社呼和浩特27日电　新华社记者雷本复报道：内蒙古自治区在实现农业合作化的第一年里，粮食、油料作物单位面积产量超过了历史上任何一年。据自治区农业厅统计，今年全区粮食每亩平均产量已达到一百三十四斤，比历史上大丰收的1954年平均每亩超过十三斤，与1950年全区粮食每亩平均七十六斤的产量相比较，已提高将近一倍。粮食单位面积产量的提高，使自治区今年粮食总产量超过了1957年的计划指标。今年的油料作物每亩平均产量也比1954年高6％。内蒙古是我国三大甜菜产区之一，今年许多农业社出现了大面积每亩产万斤以上的甜菜丰产田。
    今年全区扩大灌溉面积三百万亩，比去年增加两倍多；施肥面积占到总耕地面积的59.1％，也比去年增加了一倍。在改进耕作技术方面，各地都根据干旱特点，从1955年冬季开始普遍采取了抗旱抢种、浇水点种、锄苗、保苗等一系列防旱保墒措施。特别是推行秋耕，提高秋耕质量，推广缩垅、增行、匀播密植，效果十分显著。此外部分地区还在大面积耕地上使用杀虫农药，推广了大量新式农具和良种。所有这些措施，对提高单位面积产量，起了很大作用。
    内蒙古出现农业的历史很短，大部分农田开垦还不到一百年，农业技术和经验积累较差，而在解放前的几十年中，反动统治者在这里实行掠夺式的屯垦政策和残酷的封建剥削以及抗日战争期间日伪的摧残，使得广大贫苦农民长期采取广种薄收的方法进行生产。因而内蒙古农业上的特点是劳力不足、耕作粗放，自然灾害多，单位面积产量不高。解放后，特别是农业合作化以来，内蒙古自治区农民大力改变了历史上遗留下来的农业生产的落后状况。
