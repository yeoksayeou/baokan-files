Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 22nd: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" recently published a series of editorials commenting on some problems that have arisen in the work of correcting errors in land reform and organizational consolidation, emphasizing that in the work of rectification, it is necessary to correctly implement the Party's class line in rural areas and maintain a firm class stance.

The "People's Daily" editorial on the 16th, regarding the correct implementation of the Party's class line in rural areas, stated that due to the errors committed in land reform and organizational consolidation, some cadres lacked confidence in and became suspicious of the poor and lower-middle peasants, thereby giving rise to some phenomena of wanting to deviate from the Party's class line in rural areas. In some places, in the work of strengthening township organizations, many new cadres were squeezed out of the township leadership; in the work of adjusting land area and output, they did not consult with the poor and lower-middle peasants, but uniformly discussed it in village meetings.

The editorial criticized these phenomena and pointed out that in carrying out rectification work, it is essential to rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants. Otherwise, deviations will inevitably occur again in the work. The "People's Daily" demanded that Party committees at all levels must pay special attention to educating cadres and Party members to correctly implement the Party's class line in rural work, and constantly conduct inspections to better complete the rectification work.

The "People's Daily" said that the Party's class line in rural areas is formulated based on the actual situation in rural Vietnam and the revolutionary tasks of Vietnam at the present stage. In land reform, this line was: completely rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, closely unite with the middle peasants, unite with the rich peasants, and gradually and differentially overthrow the landlord class. Now this line is still: completely rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, closely unite with the middle peasants, unite with the rich peasants, curb the resurgence of landlords, and open up a path for landlords to transform into new people. The editorial pointed out: The great victory that the Party achieved in mobilizing peasants against imperialism and feudalism proves that this line is completely correct. The errors and shortcomings in land reform were not due to any incorrectness in this line, but precisely because this line was not correctly implemented.

The "People's Daily" then published an editorial on the 17th, further pointing out the need to prevent the resurgence of the landlord class. This editorial, entitled "Maintaining Class Viewpoint and Stand in Rectification Work," stated that since the beginning of rectification work, some cadres have not maintained a class stance in understanding the situation and carrying out work, and have shown a vague phenomenon in class viewpoint, which has greatly benefited some hostile elements.

The "People's Daily" pointed out that after land reform, many landlord elements remained stubbornly unrepentant, engaged in sabotage activities and plotted a resurgence. Especially when errors were made in land reform and organizational consolidation, the rural situation was temporarily unstable, the unity among the laboring peasants was temporarily relaxed, and some people were confused among all strata of the people, the landlord class would take the opportunity to move more actively, split the peasants, and instigate the masses to engage in illegal activities. Rectification work is one of the measures to smash their conspiracy. It is a mistake if this is not recognized.

At the same time, it must be clearly recognized in policy: for those who have been wrongly classified and unjustly treated, we will resolutely reclassify them and exonerate them. However, this cannot therefore eliminate the boundaries between landlords and peasants, between right and wrong. We are determined to rectify errors, but at the same time we must maintain the fruits that the peasants have already obtained in land reform, and we cannot deny what we have done correctly. From a humanitarian spirit, the government has promulgated some policies to open up a path for the landlord class to transform. These policies must be strictly implemented in rectification and in the future, so that the landlord class can become good citizens who are beneficial to society through labor and education. But on the other hand, stubborn landlords who refuse to reform, oppose the peasants, and disrupt rural peace and order must be resolutely suppressed. The opinion that we should currently adopt a policy of educating and transforming the landlord class and not take suppression measures violates the spirit of the policy and does not conform to the actual situation in rural areas.

The "People's Daily" finally emphasized that in rectification work, we must be particularly cautious and avoid repeating past mistakes, but we must also maintain a class viewpoint and stance, correctly implement policies, and constantly heighten our vigilance. Facing the sabotage activities and resurgence conspiracy of the landlord class, we cannot be weak and allow things to drift.

    越南“人民报”评纠偏工作中的问题
    强调依靠贫雇农防止地主抬头
    据新华社河内22日电　越南“人民报”最近连续发表社论，评论在纠正土地改革和整顿组织所犯错误的工作中发生的一些问题，指出在纠偏工作中必须正确执行党在农村中的阶级路线和站稳阶级立场。
    “人民报”在16日发表的关于正确执行党在农村中的阶级路线的社论说，由于土地改革和整顿组织中所犯的错误，有一部分干部对贫雇农缺乏信心和发生怀疑，从而产生了一些想离开党在农村中的阶级路线的现象。在一些地方，在健全乡组织的工作中把许多新的干部排挤出乡的领导机构；在调整土地面积和产量的工作中，不和贫雇农商量，而一律由村的会议来讨论。
    社论对这些现象进行了批评，并且指出，在进行纠偏工作中，必须切实依靠贫雇农。否则，在工作中就难免不再发生偏差。“人民报”要求各级党委必须特别注意教育干部和党员正确地执行党在农村工作中的阶级路线，并且不断进行检查，以更好地完成纠偏工作。
      “人民报”说，党在农村中的阶级路线是根据越南农村的实际情况和越南现阶段的革命任务制定的。在土地改革中，这个路线是：完全依靠贫雇农，密切团结中农，联合富农，逐步和有分别地打倒地主阶级。现在这个路线仍然是：完全依靠贫雇农，密切团结中农，联合富农，制止地主抬头，给地主开辟改造成新人的道路。社论指出：党在发动农民反对帝国主义和封建主义过程中取得的伟大胜利，证明了这个路线是完全正确的。在土地改革中的错误和缺点，并非由于这个路线有不正确的地方，而正是由于没有正确地执行这个路线。
    “人民报”接着在17日发表社论，进一步指出要防止地主阶级的抬头。这篇题为“在纠偏工作中保持阶级观点和立场”的社论说，从开始进行纠偏工作以来，有一部分干部在认识情况和进行工作的时候，没有保持阶级立场，在阶级观点上表现了模糊的现象，使一些敌对分子大大得势。
    “人民报”指出，在土地改革以后，有许多地主分子仍然顽固不化，进行破坏活动并阴谋抬头。尤其是在土地改革和整顿组织中犯了错误，农村情况暂时不够稳定，劳动农民之间的团结暂时还松弛，在各阶层人民中有些人混乱的时候，地主阶级会更加乘机活动，分裂农民和唆使群众进行非法活动。纠偏工作正是粉碎他们阴谋的措施之一。如果不认清这一点，就是一种错误。
    同时，在政策上必须认清：对于被划错成分、受到冤枉处理的人，我们坚决重划成分和予以洗雪。但是，这不能因此而取消地主和农民之间、错误和正确之间的界限。我们坚决纠偏，但同时也要保持农民在土地改革中已经获得的果实，不能够否认我们做得对的事情。从人道主义精神出发，政府曾经颁布了一些政策，给地主阶级开辟改造道路。这些政策在纠偏中和在今后都必须严格加以执行，使地主阶级通过劳动和教育，变成有益于社会的好的公民。但另一方面，对于拒绝改造、反对农民、破坏农村安宁秩序的顽固地主就必须坚决镇压。关于认为目前应该采取教育、改造地主阶级的方针而不需要采取镇压措施的意见，是违反政策的精神和不符合于农村的实际情况的。
    “人民报”最后强调说，在纠偏工作中，必须特别慎重，不要重犯过去的错误，但是，我们也必须保持阶级观点和立场，正确执行政策，随时提高警惕，面对着地主阶级的破坏行动和抬头阴谋，我们不能软弱和放任自流。
