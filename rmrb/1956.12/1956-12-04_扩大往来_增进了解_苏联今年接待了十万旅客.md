Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 3rd: The Director of the Soviet International Travel Agency, Ankudinov, recently wrote an article in "Moscow News," summarizing the situation of the Soviet travel season this year. He said that this year, 100,000 tourists from forty countries have traveled to the Soviet Union. Sixty-seven foreign travel companies have jointly organized travel with the Soviet International Travel Agency.

    Tourists from Czechoslovakia, France, Finland, Switzerland, Italy, Sweden, Austria and other countries came to the Soviet Union in particularly large numbers. The Soviet Union's ties with the United States in travel affairs have also become more active than before.

    Ankudinov said that Soviet travelers have toured twenty-four countries in the East and the West. Two thousand people traveled to France, Italy, Sweden, and Romania each, five thousand traveled to Czechoslovakia, and two thousand five hundred traveled to the German Democratic Republic. Many Soviet tourists took the "Victory" diesel ship for a tour around Europe.

    He said that considering that next year's travel season will be more active than this year, Moscow's hotels will be greatly increased. Large hotels such as the "Ukraine Hotel," which can accommodate two thousand people, will all be open in 1957, and existing hotels will also be expanded. The Soviet Union has also run special training classes for training guides and translators.

    He said that travel by car will be more popular next year.

    扩大往来　增进了解
　　苏联今年接待了十万旅客
    新华社莫斯科3日电　苏联国际旅行社社长安库吉诺夫最近在“莫斯科新闻”上写了一篇文章，总结今年苏联旅行季节的情况。他说，今年已经有四十个国家的十万名旅客到苏联旅行。有六十七个外国旅行公司同苏联国际旅行社联合进行了旅行的组织工作。
    从捷克斯洛伐克、法国、芬兰、瑞士、意大利、瑞典、奥地利等国家到苏联来的旅客特别多。苏联同美国在旅行事务上的联系也比以前活跃了。
    安库吉诺夫说，苏联的旅行者游历了东方和西方的二十四个国家。到法国、意大利、瑞典和罗马尼亚旅行的各两千人，到捷克斯洛伐克旅行的有五千人，到德意志民主共和国旅行的有二千五百人。许多苏联旅客乘“胜利号”柴油船作了环游欧洲的旅行。
    他说，由于考虑到明年的旅行季节要比今年的更加活跃，莫斯科的旅馆将大大增加。可以容纳二千人的“乌克兰旅馆”等大型旅馆在1957年都将开始营业，现有的旅馆也要扩建。苏联还办了训练向导和译员的特别训练班。
    他说，明年将更盛行乘汽车的旅行。
