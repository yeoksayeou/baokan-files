Xinhua News Agency, 10th — Bo Yibo, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Economic Commission, explained the expected implementation of China's first five-year plan and some issues in compiling the second five-year plan at the Second Member Representative Congress of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce today.

In his report, Bo Yibo discussed the basic tasks and some main indicators of the second five-year plan. He also explained how to correctly handle the relationship between national construction and people's lives. He said that the purpose of the great socialist revolution carried out by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Party is to build a happy new life without exploitation and poverty. To achieve this goal, enormous socialist construction must be undertaken. Both construction and life are determined by the level of production development at that time. However, at a certain level of production development, there is a certain contradiction between the needs of construction and the needs of life. Too much construction will hinder necessary improvements in life, and conversely, too much improvement in life will hinder necessary construction. Doing too much of both will disconnect the needs of construction and life from the possibilities of production, causing imbalances in economic life. This year's experience tells us that it is not feasible to develop national construction and improve people's lives divorced from the current level of production development, and it is detrimental to the development of China's socialist construction cause.

Bo Yibo said that the conditions for further expanding the scale of capital construction, increasing its speed, and further improving life are how each of us labors, how we better integrate socialist construction with the improvement of people's lives, and how we improve the management of our enterprises. If all production departments can provide the people with more, better, and cheaper products, if capital construction departments can provide the people with more, better, and cheaper buildings, if transportation departments can transport more goods and passengers more quickly and cheaply, if commercial departments can further reduce commodity circulation costs and better serve the people, and if all business departments and organizations can do the work of several people with one person, instead of several people doing the work of one person, and do the work of several yuan with one yuan, instead of doing the work of one yuan with several yuan, and if our entire society can advocate thrift and not pursue extravagance, then the scale of China's socialist construction will be larger, the speed will be faster, and the improvement of people's lives will be greater.

Finally, Bo Yibo spoke about the government's fixed-interest policy, saying that the government's redemption policy is a pragmatic policy, and the fixed interest paid by the government to industrialists and businessmen will continue, at least during the second five-year plan period.

When he mentioned that some small and medium-sized capitalists were willing to give up fixed interest in order to shed their capitalist label, he said that many of them originally had very little capital, and many of them participated in labor. This part of the people can be called petty bourgeoisie or upper petty bourgeoisie instead of capitalists. The representatives responded to his remarks with warm applause.

Bo Yibo said that fixed interest is the state's redemption policy for the bourgeoisie. The state's policy toward fixed interest is pragmatic. Considering that prematurely abolishing fixed interest would affect the lives of some capitalists, it will not be abolished until the conditions are ripe. He also said that the contradiction between the Chinese bourgeoisie and the working class is no longer an antagonistic contradiction.

Bo Yibo said that China's bourgeoisie and its intellectuals number about eight million. They are relatively educated, have technology, and have experience in managing enterprises. The country needs to use their production capacity to build socialism.

Bo Yibo called on industrialists and businessmen to produce more and better products and improve the operation and management of enterprises.

    在全国工商联会员代表大会上
    薄一波谈经济建设和赎买政策
    继续执行定息政策，条件不成熟就不取消。　部分中小资本家可称为小资产阶级或上层小资产阶级。　目前工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾不是对抗性的。
    新华社10日讯　国务院副总理兼国家经济委员会主任薄一波今天在全国工商业联合会第二届会员代表大会上，就我国第一个五年计划执行的预计情况和编制第二个五年计划的一些问题作了说明。
    薄一波在报告中，谈述了第二个五年计划的基本任务和一些主要指标。并说明如何正确地处理国家建设和人民生活的关系问题。他说，我国人民在党的领导下，进行伟大的社会主义革命的目的，就是为了建设一种没有剥削，没有贫困的幸福的新生活，而要达到这个目的，就要进行巨大的社会主义建设。建设和生活，都是由那个时期的生产发展水平所决定的。但是，在一定的生产发展水平之下，建设的需要和生活的需要之间，是有一定的矛盾的。建设的过多，就会妨碍必要的生活改善，反之生活改善的过多，就会妨碍必要的建设，两者都搞得过多，就使建设和生活的需要同生产的可能之间脱节，而造成经济生活的失调。今年的经验告诉我们，国家建设的发展和人民生活的改善如果脱离了当前生产发展的水平，是行不通的，是对我国社会主义建设事业的发展有害的。
    薄一波说，我们要更加扩大基本建设的规模，提高其速度，和更进一步改善生活，决定的条件是我们每个人怎样地劳动，是我们怎样地把社会主义建设事业和人民生活的改善更好地结合起来，是我们怎样地改善我国企业的管理工作。如果所有的生产部门能够给人民提供更多、更好、更便宜的产品，基本建设部门能够给人民提供更多、更好、更便宜的建筑物，交通运输部门能够更迅速、更便宜地载运更多的货物和旅客，商业部门能够更多地降低商品流通费用和更好地为人民服务，一切事业部门和机关团体都能够以一个人办几个人的事情，而不是几个人办一个人的事情，以一元钱办几元钱的事情，而不是几元钱办一元钱的事情，我们整个社会都能崇尚俭朴，不务奢华，那么我国的社会主义建设规模就会更大，速度就会更快，人民生活的改善也就会更多。
    最后，薄一波又就政府的定息政策说，政府的赎买政策是实事求是的政策，政府支付给工商业者的定息将继续下去，至少在第二个五年计划期间不会取消。
    当他讲到有些中、小资本家愿意放弃定息，以便摘掉他们的资产阶级帽子的时候，他说，他们之中，有很多人的资本本来很少，而且许多人都参加劳动，这一部分人，可以不称他们为资产阶级而称他们为小资产阶级或上层小资产阶级，代表们对他这番话报以热烈的掌声。
    薄一波说定息是国家对资产阶级的赎买政策。国家对待定息的政策是实事求是的，考虑到过早地取消定息会影响部分资本家的生活，条件不成熟就不会取消。他还说目前中国资产阶级和工人阶级之间的矛盾已经不是对抗性的矛盾了。
    薄一波说中国的资产阶级及其知识分子约有八百万人，他们比较有文化、有技术、有管理企业的经验，国家需要利用他们的生产能力来建设社会主义。
    薄一波号召工商业者生产更多更好的产品，改善企业的经营管理。
