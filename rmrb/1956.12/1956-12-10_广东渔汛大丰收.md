    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 4th. This autumn, Guangdong has seen a general bumper harvest in various fishing grounds and of various fish species. In the Weizhou fishing ground of Hainan Island, during the peak fishing season, an average pair of boats can catch 3,000 catties of fish per day, with the highest reaching 12,000 catties. The Shantou Special Zone, where the fishing season started earlier, has mostly overfulfilled its plan. Most counties in the Huiyang and Foshan Special Zones also have higher yields than in previous years. Among them, yellow croaker, red fish, "dizai" fish, "nai" fish, and large shrimp have the most abundant harvests. The yellow croaker season in the Huiyang Special Zone not only had a large output but also lasted longer than in previous years. The "nai" fish production in the Foshan Special Zone increased three times compared to the same period last year. It is estimated that from September to the present, Guangdong's aquatic product output has reached more than 280 million catties.
