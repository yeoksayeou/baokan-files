    Two Suggestions Regarding the Collection of Materials on Modern Chinese History
    At present, the research work on modern Chinese history is relatively backward. There are many reasons for this, but one of the main reasons is the extreme lack of materials. In order to solve this problem, I put forward the following two suggestions.
    1. Step up the collection of materials. This work cannot be done solely by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the People's Publishing House. Historical research institutions across the country, especially the history departments of universities, should take on this responsibility. Some of these materials are documents and cultural relics, while others need to be obtained through direct investigation and interviews with elderly people. In particular, the work of investigation and interviews must not be delayed, because the elderly will gradually decrease due to aging. Moreover, this work can mainly be carried out by the history departments of universities. They can combine it with the activities of student scientific research groups, with guidance from tutors and recording by students. After the materials are collected, they can be processed and sorted, and then handed over to local publishing houses for publication, without having to be published by the central publishing house.
    2. The Third Institute of the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences should grasp the situation of national materials related to modern Chinese history, and successively compile and print catalogs of materials, indicating the collecting institution, and adding abstracts to important materials for the use of historians. In addition, some rare and valuable materials should be published in the "Modern History Materials" publication in a timely manner.

    关于搜集中国现代史资料的两点建议
    目前，中国现代史的研究工作是比较落后的，原因固然很多，但是主要原因之一就是资料极其缺乏。为了解决这个问题，我提出如下两点建议。
    一、加紧收集资料。这个工作不能专靠中国科学院和人民出版社来做。全国各地历史研究机关，特别是高等学校的历史系应该负起这个责任。这些资料有的是文件、文物，有的是要靠直接向老年的人进行调查访问得来的。特别是调查访问工作决不容缓，因为老年人是会由于年龄的增长而逐渐减少的。并且，这个工作主要可由高等学校历史系来进行。他们可以结合学生科学研究小组的活动，由导师来指导，学生作纪录。资料集中以后，经过加工整理，就可交给地方出版社出版，不必都由中央出版社出版。
    二、中国科学院历史研究所第三所应该掌握全国有关中国现代史资料的情况，陆续编印资料目录，注明收藏机关，并对重要资料加上提要，以供史学工作者利用。此外，有些罕见而有价值的资料，还应及时在“近代史资料”刊物上发表。
