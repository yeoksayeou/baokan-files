Development of Production and Construction Undertakings Brings Benefits to the People
　　Shanghai Adds Over 140,000 Jobs This Year

　　(Our newspaper's dispatch from Shanghai, December 4th) This year, Shanghai has added over 140,000 jobs, the largest increase in employees since liberation. This figure only includes statistics up to the third quarter.

　　A characteristic of the increase in workers in Shanghai this year is that there are more in industry and construction, with heavy industry exceeding light industry.

　　The development of production is the main reason for the large increase in workers this year. This year, Shanghai's industrial production has seen reasonable development under the policy of "fully utilizing and rationally developing." For example, due to the surge in social demand for paper, some workshops were expanded. After implementing a three-and-a-half shift system, where the machines never stop, 26 out of 27 factories added workers, with the entire industry adding over 1,700 workers. In the process of socialist transformation and economic reorganization, some enterprises also absorbed a group of peddlers and small business owners to participate in work.

　　Of the total number of people employed in Shanghai this year, about half were transferred from Shanghai to other places to directly participate in construction. Their footprints are all over the country's key construction areas.

　　Some problems also exist in Shanghai's labor employment this year. The main problem is that some enterprises or administrative units are blindly increasing personnel, demanding too many people. For example, the state-owned Shanghai Construction Machinery Manufacturing Factory blindly increased more than 500 employees without formulating a correct labor plan. Many workers have no work to do, and now more than 100 new workers are asking the Shanghai labor department to handle their cases separately. This situation has also occurred in other enterprises. Secondly, due to the increase in employment opportunities, some enterprises are casually recruiting people from rural areas, and the phenomenon of rural populations blindly flowing to cities has developed again. Among those who have already been employed, some have returned without authorization after being introduced to work in other places. They pick and choose jobs in disregard of actual needs, only wanting to stay in Shanghai and not wanting to go to other places; only wanting to be in the city and not wanting to be in the countryside. Among those who are not yet working, some make excessively high and urgent demands regardless of their own employment conditions and the needs of the country.

　　The Shanghai labor department is currently conducting publicity and explanations to the people regarding the above issues and is carrying out follow-up work.

### 生产建设事业发展给人民带来的福利　上海今年有十四万多人就业

　　生产建设事业发展给人民带来的福利
　　上海今年有十四万多人就业
    本报上海4日电　上海市今年又有十四万余人就业，这是解放以来职工增加最多的一年，这个数字还只统计到第三季度为止。
    今年上海增加工人的特点是工业、建筑业较多，其中重工业又多于轻工业。
    生产的发展是今年大量增加工人的主要原因。今年上海市的工业生产，在“充分利用，合理发展”的方针下有了合理的发展。例如，造纸业由于社会需要激增，扩建了
  一部分车间，实行停人不停车的三班半制以后，二十七个工厂中有二十六个厂都增添了工人，全业增加的工人有一千七百多人。在社会主义改造和经济改组过程中，有些企业还吸收了一批摊贩、小业主参加工作。
    今年上海劳动就业的总人数中，约有一半左右是由上海输送到外地去直接参加建设的，他们的足迹遍布全国各个重点建设地区。
    今年上海的劳动就业中也存在一些问题。主要问题是有些企业或行政单位在增加人员中带有盲目性，要人过多。如国营上海建筑机械制造厂，没有订出正确的劳动计划，就盲目增加了五百多职工，许多工人无工可做，现在有一百多新工人要求上海劳动部门另行处理。这种情形在别的企业也有发生。其次是由于就业机会的增加，有些企业又随便地向农村招收人员，农村人口盲目向城市流动的现象又有发展。在已经就业的人中，有些人介绍到外地工作后，又擅自跑回，他们不顾实际需要地多方挑拣职业，只愿在上海不愿到别地；只愿在城市，不愿在农村。在目前尚未工作的人中，有的不问本人的就业条件，和国家需要，提出过高过急的要求。
    上述这些问题，上海市劳动部门正在向人民群众进行宣传解释和进行善后处理工作。
