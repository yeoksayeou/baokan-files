Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 21st. In order to transform unfinished wells and increase water volume, the Henan Provincial Water Conservancy Department has trained over 400 water conservancy technical cadres and experienced well-digging members from agricultural cooperatives. The water conservancy departments of various special districts and counties are currently conducting similar training. Some areas that have completed training have begun the construction phase.

Henan Province dug 1.04 million wells this year. Nearly half of them are unfinished wells that need to be transformed because they are shallow and the water volume is insufficient for waterwheels to draw water. In late autumn and early winter, the Provincial Water Conservancy Department organized water conservancy technicians and well-digging technicians to research a method of digging small wells within the unfinished wells to deepen the wellbore. After testing, each transformed well can increase the water volume by three to five times, and some even increase the water volume by eight to ten times, and it can no longer be drained by animal-powered waterwheels. Some can even use a five-horsepower water pump to pump water. This method of transforming unfinished wells is generally applicable to areas with good aquifers within two to three zhang below the bottom of the well. If a small well with a depth of two zhang and a diameter of 1.5 chi is dug, in addition to about 80 man-days of labor, the total cost of other materials such as bricks, wood, nails, and hemp is only about 30 yuan, which can save more than two-thirds of the expenses compared to digging a large well. The method of digging small wells is also very simple, and people do not need to go down the well, so it is very safe.

According to the plan of the Provincial Water Conservancy Department, the province will transform 100,000 unfinished wells in 1957.

    河南开始改造半成井
    新华社郑州21日电　为改造半成井，增加井水量，河南省水利厅已经训练了水利技术干部和农业社中对打井有经验的社员共四百多人。各专区、县的水利部门目前正在进行同样的训练工作。有些已经结束训练的地方，开始转入了施工阶段。
    河南省今年打井一百零四万眼。其中近半数因为井浅，水量不足，不够水车拉水，所以是半成井，需要加以改造。秋末冬初，省水利厅组织水利技术人员和打井技术工人研究出一种在半成井内打小井，加深井筒的改造办法。经过试验，每眼井改造以后能够增加三——五倍的井水量，有的还增加八——十倍井水量，并且用畜力水车再也拉不干了，有的甚至能够用五马力的抽水机来抽水。这个改造半成井的办法，一般适用于在井底下两三丈深以内有良好含水层的地区。如果打一眼深二丈口径一点五市尺的小井，除费人工八十个左右外，其他砖、木、钉、麻等物料共计不过三十元左右，比打一眼大井可以节省开支三分之二以上。打小井的方法也很简单，人不下井，很安全。
    根据省水利厅的计划，1957年内全省将改造十万眼半成井。
