    The Second Member Representative Assembly of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce concluded yesterday. Under the care and guidance of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, this meeting focused on discussing and resolving the question of how to further promote the positive role of the industrial and commercial circles. This was completely necessary and timely. After the nationwide public-private partnership of capitalist industry and commerce, many industrialists and businessmen expressed urgent concerns about how to further accept socialist transformation and how to arrange their personal futures. These issues have now been satisfactorily resolved. We believe that after the representatives attending the meeting return to their respective regions and convey the spirit of the assembly, the national industrial and commercial circles will surely further enhance their awareness, unite more closely under the banner of patriotism, and contribute their strength to the socialist cause of the motherland.
    Our national bourgeoisie is patriotic. In the seven years since liberation, the national bourgeoisie has participated in successive patriotic movements, done much politically that was beneficial to the country and the people, and played a certain positive role economically in supporting national construction and meeting the needs of the people. In the high tide of the nationwide public-private partnership of capitalist industry and commerce, the national bourgeoisie actually handed over their enterprises to the state, becoming an indispensable force in the country's economic construction.
    The bourgeoisie, as a class, is moving towards extinction. The vast majority of industrialists and businessmen across the country have become state employees, and many have even assumed leadership positions. This is something that China's national bourgeoisie is delighted and proud of. However, before this representative assembly, many people were still unsure about the length of the fixed interest period and not confident about whether public-private relations could be handled well. If these problems cannot be properly resolved, they may affect their enthusiasm for work and study. In order to solve these problems, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has put forward a suggestion: starting from this year, the fixed interest period can be extended by seven years, and if industrialists and businessmen still have difficulties in their lives after seven years, they can continue to be taken care of. As for the issue of public-private cooperation, the direction of future efforts for private personnel has also been clearly pointed out. Many industrialists and businessmen unanimously stated in their speeches at the assembly that they further recognized the Party and the government's meticulous care for the industrial and commercial circles, which is very natural.
    In order to transform industrialists and businessmen and give full play to their role, the state has already arranged the necessary environment and conditions for their work and life. The current situation is exactly what is called "everything is ready, only the east wind is awaited." What is this "east wind"? We believe that this is the determination of industrialists and businessmen to further accept transformation and their sustained efforts in daily work and study. Industrialists and businessmen should clearly recognize the consistency of personal interests and national interests. Only when the country becomes increasingly prosperous and strong can the individual's future become increasingly bright. Industrialists and businessmen, like workers and peasants, must abide by the principle of individual interests being subordinate to national interests and immediate interests being subordinate to long-term interests when dealing with any issue, and closely integrate personal interests with national interests. Now the highest interests of the state and the people are to concentrate efforts on developing economic construction with heavy industry as the mainstay, and to lay the material foundation for socialism. Industrialists and businessmen should give full play to their initiative, contribute all their wisdom and talents to the country, and contribute their strength to economic construction. Whoever does this will surely have a bright future.
    If industrialists and businessmen want to play a greater role in joint ventures, they must handle public-private relations well. The key to handling public-private relations well is to maintain normal relations with the workers and staff. Since the relations of production in enterprises have fundamentally changed, the antagonistic emotions that previously existed between the workers and staff and the industrial and commercial capitalists can be changed. In order to improve public-private relations, private personnel should adopt a positive and correct attitude, not "seeking to avoid mistakes," but "striving for merits." The so-called "merits" are to sincerely approach the workers and staff, humbly accept the opinions of the workers and staff, give full play to their knowledge and skills, and actively and voluntarily do their work well. In this way, the perceptions of the workers and staff will gradually change. At the same time, private personnel should respect the leadership of the public representatives and maintain good cooperative relations with the public representatives. As long as private personnel have good relations with the workers and staff, their relations with the public representatives will also be easily improved.
    In order to handle public-private relations well, the Party and trade union organizations must also educate the workers and staff, so that they understand that the powers and functions of private personnel in enterprises are the powers and functions that they should have as ordinary state employees, and it is no longer the power obtained by relying on capital in the past. We should take the initiative to improve our relations with them and run the enterprises well, so that it is in line with the long-term interests of the working class.
    Strengthening the unity of industrialists and businessmen is also an important factor in giving full play to their positive role. Due to the residual influence of the old society, many industrialists and businessmen inevitably have phenomena of mutual suspicion, mutual disagreement, mutual infighting, and mutual exclusion. This phenomenon is harmful and unprofitable to oneself and others, and to the country and the people. Industrialists and businessmen have become employees of public-private joint ventures or state-owned enterprises, the material basis for past conflicts of interest has been eliminated, everyone is working for the country and for building socialism, and they should all unite under the banner of patriotism, use the methods of criticism and self-criticism, learn from each other, and supervise each other. In this way, the industrialists and businessmen across the country will also improve each other and make progress together.
    In the past few years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce has united and educated the national industrial and commercial circles, promoted the industrial and commercial circles to participate in patriotic movements, improved production and operation, and encouraged the industrial and commercial circles to accept socialist transformation, and has done a lot of work. In the future, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce should continue to play its role, mobilize all positive factors in the industrial and commercial circles, and serve socialist construction. After the completion of socialist transformation, the members of the national bourgeoisie will become socialist workers. However, for a considerable period of time, they will still have more remnants of bourgeois ideology. Therefore, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce must continue to contact them and help them carry out ideological transformation. That is to say, the tasks of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce in the future are still very important. It should continue to shoulder important tasks, and it will certainly be able to continue to complete important tasks.

### 工商界今后的重大任务

    工商界今后的重大任务
    中华全国工商业联合会第二届会员代表大会在昨天闭幕。这次会议在中共中央和毛泽东同志的关怀和指导下，着重地讨论和解决了怎样进一步发挥工商界的积极作用的问题。这是完全必要和适时的。资本主义工商业全行业公私合营以后，许多工商业者对于怎样进一步接受社会主义改造，对于个人的前途怎样安排等问题，表示了迫切的关心。这些问题现在已经得到了圆满的解决。我们相信，参加会议的代表们回到各地传达了大会的精神，全国工商界一定能够进一步提高觉悟，在爱国主义的旗帜下更加紧密地团结起来，为祖国的社会主义事业贡献自己的力量。
    我国的民族资产阶级是爱国的。解放后七年来，民族资产阶级参加了历次的爱国运动，在政治上做了不少有利于国家、人民的事情，在经济上发挥了一定的支援国家建设和满足人民需要的积极作用。在资本主义工商业全行业公私合营的高潮中，民族资产阶级实际上把他们的企业交给了国家，成为国家经济建设中一支不可缺少的力量。
    资产阶级作为一个阶级，正在走向消灭。全国工商业者的绝大多数，已经成为国家工作人员，不少人并且担负了领导职务。这是我国民族资产阶级欢欣鼓舞引以为荣的事情。但是，有许多人，在这次代表大会以前，对于定息期限的长短还不摸底，对于公私关系能否搞好还不放心。这些问题如果不能很好地加以解决，就可能影响他们的工作和学习的积极性。为了解决这些问题，中共中央已经提出一个建议：从今年算起，定息时间可以延长七年，七年以后如果工商业者在生活上还有困难，可以继续加以照顾。至于公私共事关系问题，也明确地指出了私方人员今后努力的方向。许多工商业者在大会发言中一致表示，他们在代表大会上进一步认识了党和政府对工商界无微不至的关怀，这是很自然的。
    为了改造工商业者，充分发挥他们的作用，国家已经给他们安排了工作、生活所必需的环境和条件。现在的情况正是所谓“万事俱备，只待东风”了。这“东风”是什么呢？我们认为，这就是工商业者进一步接受改造的决心和他们在日常工作、学习中持久的努力。工商业者应该明确认识个人利益和国家利益的一致性，只有国家日益繁荣强盛，个人的前途才能日益灿烂光明。工商业者处理任何问题，同工人、农民处理任何问题一样，都要遵守个人利益服从国家利益、眼前利益服从长远利益的原则，把个人利益同国家利益很好地结合起来。现在国家和人民的最高利益是集中力量发展以重工业为主的经济建设，奠定社会主义的物质基础。工商业者应该发挥高度积极性，把全部聪明才智贡献给国家，在经济建设中尽一份力量。谁这样作了，谁就一定有光明的前途。
    工商业者要想在合营企业中发挥更大的作用，必须搞好公私共事关系。搞好公私共事关系的关键，是同职工群众保持正常的关系。由于企业的生产关系基本上改变了，因此，过去存在于职工群众和工商业资本家之间的对立情绪就有改变的可能。为了改善公私共事关系，私方人员应该采取积极、正确的态度，不是“但求无过”，而要“力争有功”。所谓“有功”，就是诚恳地接近职工群众，虚心地接受职工群众的意见，发挥自己的所学所长，积极主动地做好工作。这样，职工群众的观感就会逐渐转变过来。私方人员同时应该尊重公方代表的领导，同公方代表搞好合作共事的关系。只要私方人员和职工群众的关系搞好了，他们同公方代表的关系也就容易搞好。
    为了搞好公私共事关系，党和工会组织也要教育职工群众，让他们懂得：私方人员在企业中的职权，是他们作为普通的国家工作人员所应有的职权，它已经不是过去依靠资本取得的权力。我们应该主动地同他们搞好关系，把企业办得好好的，这样才符合工人阶级的长远利益。
    加强工商业者的团结，也是发挥工商业者的积极作用的一个重要因素。由于旧社会的残余影响，不少工商业者还不免有互相猜忌、互不服气、互相倾轧、互相排挤的现象。这种现象，无论对己对人，于国于民，都是有害无利的。工商业者已经成为公私合营企业或国营企业的工作人员，过去利益冲突的物质基础已经消灭，大家都是为着国家做事，为着建设社会主义，就都应该在爱国主义的旗帜下团结起来，运用批评和自我批评的方法，互相学习，互相监督。这样，全国的工商业者也就会互相提高，共同进步。
    在过去几年中，工商业联合会在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，团结和教育全国工商界，推动工商界参加爱国运动，改善生产经营，鼓励工商界接受社会主义改造，作了很多的工作。今后工商联应该继续发挥作用，调动工商界一切积极因素，为社会主义建设服务。在社会主义改造完成以后，民族资产阶级的成员就要变成社会主义的劳动者。但是，他们在相当长的时期内，还会残存较多的资产阶级思想。因此，工商业联合会要继续联系他们，帮助他们进行思想改造。这就是说，工商业联合会今后的任务仍然是十分重大的。它应该继续担负重大的任务，也一定能够继续完成重大的任务。
