    The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant Under Construction
    By Our Correspondent Cao Baoming
    At the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition held in Wuhan this past May and June, there was a huge lathe. It was seven meters high and weighed sixty-seven tons. It could cut large objects two meters high, three point four meters in diameter, and twenty tons in weight. Although it was very large, because it was electrically controlled, all the electric knobs, signal lights, thermometers, pressure gauges, hydraulic speed change handles, and charts for selecting the number of revolutions of the dial were concentrated on the operating table, making operation very convenient. Just touching the switch of the lubricating motor immediately sent lubricating oil to all parts of the machine tool. The eighteen-ton beam could also be moved to the required position with just a press of the electric knob. Once the object was cut, the tool holder would automatically stop moving. Once the oil circuit was blocked, signal lights and electric bells would sound alarms one after another. When the temperature exceeded 60 degrees Celsius, the lathe would automatically stop.
    This lathe attracted tens of thousands of viewers. Everyone admired its great power and new technology, calling it the "lathe giant." But at the same time, a question mark was left in everyone's mind: when will China be able to produce such huge machine tools?
    The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, which is currently under construction, will produce this kind of machine tool and even heavier and larger machine tools in the future!
    In China's industrial construction, heavy machine tools are essential for manufacturing large components such as turbines for hydroelectric power stations and various large-scale equipment. Heavy machine tools are also needed to improve work efficiency by concentrating dozens of identical parts for processing at once when processing small parts. Heavy machine tools are becoming increasingly important in China's industrial construction. Comrade Zhou Enlai said in the "Report on the Proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy": "Efforts to develop the machine-building industry, especially the manufacturing of various heavy equipment, special machine tools, precision machine tools, and instruments that we need and lack, is a key focus of industrial construction in the future."
    The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant is being built with the assistance of the Soviet Union. It will produce heavy and precise vertical lathes, horizontal boring machines, spiral milling machines, gantry milling machines, and various special machine tools.
    This is a factory with versatile modern equipment. Casting is one of the most labor-intensive tasks in machine manufacturing, but in this factory, pattern making will use sandblasting machines and molding machines, and after the castings are removed from the mold, hydraulic sandblasting machines will be used to remove the sand. To adapt to technically complex production, the central laboratory will have a variety of testing equipment, as well as "X-ray" equipment for viewing the inside of processed objects.
    The factory was originally planned to be fully completed by the end of 1959, and full-scale production was to begin at the beginning of 1960. However, in order to meet the needs of accelerating socialist construction, the factory construction workers decided at the beginning of this year to complete the factory construction project one and a half years ahead of schedule, that is, to fully complete the factory by the second quarter of 1958, and to start full-scale production in the third quarter of the same year.
    This decision immediately ignited the enthusiasm of the masses and became the goal of struggle for all factory construction personnel. The designers of the Central South Industrial Architectural Design Institute, which undertook most of the domestic design of this factory, put forward the slogan of "not wasting a minute" and tried to use standard purchased parts as much as possible, actively tapped potential, and completed the construction drawing design of thirty-one projects three months ahead of schedule. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, they also changed the three-track railway to a single track, simplifying the project and saving the state 108,000 yuan in investment.
    The comrades in the factory's equipment supply section originally believed that many domestically supplied equipment items had been contracted with the manufacturing plants, stipulating delivery dates that could not be advanced. Equipment such as ventilators and cranes could not be ordered until the construction design was sent from abroad in August of this year, let alone delivered in advance. However, after they criticized the ideological style of "sitting in the office and calling for difficulties," they went to various manufacturing plants to negotiate, and all the manufacturing plants enthusiastically supported them. Originally, two hundred machine tools were to be delivered in advance, and now one hundred and ninety-eight can be delivered in advance. They also followed the suggestion of Soviet expert Bezsviriy and ordered goods in advance according to the technical design, while sending the order forms to the Soviet design unit, asking the design unit to quickly modify and send back the specifications of the equipment that needed to be changed, so that equipment such as cranes and ventilators could also be supplied in advance according to the specifications, and would not cause backlog due to changes in construction design. They also selected thirty-two heavy machine tools from the state's inventory equipment for early installation, saving the country more than 7 million yuan in foreign exchange.
    In the second quarter, when the thousands of employees of the Central South First Engineering Company, which was responsible for the construction, were working hard for "completing the construction of the entire factory one and a half years ahead of schedule," they encountered difficulties with materials, especially the shortage of steel bars. Soviet expert Kopeilenko immediately went to Guangzhou with technicians from both parties to learn from the experience of using bamboo-reinforced concrete instead of steel-reinforced concrete. After returning, they immediately built a workshop next to the construction site, specializing in the production of bamboo reinforcement. Guangzhou only used bamboo-reinforced concrete to make floor slabs with smaller stress in civil buildings. After experiments, they further used it to make floor beams and stairs with larger stress, and used it to make skylight side panels and thermal power pipeline trench covers for industrial buildings. They produced more than 900,000 meters of bamboo reinforcement in a few months, which was used to replace 130 tons of steel bars. They also used bamboo scaffolding instead of wooden scaffolding, bamboo props instead of wooden props, and bamboo formwork instead of wooden formwork. The factory buildings and temporary buildings of many affiliated enterprises are also bamboo structures. They also promoted advanced experience such as dry-hard concrete and cold-drawn steel bars. This year, they have promoted more than 30 material-saving experiences, overcoming the difficulty of material shortage, ensuring the construction of the project according to plan, and also saving more than 200,000 yuan in funds.
    This factory has been under construction for more than a year since the earth leveling project started in September last year. A year ago, this was still a hilly area, with sparse weeds growing on the hills, golden ears of grain in the terraced fields, and cattle drinking water by the pond. Now, dozens of buildings have been built in the factory front area, including the factory office building, staff dormitories, technical schools, and practice factories. A dedicated railway line branching off from the Yuehan Railway has penetrated the factory area through the deeply muddy Sha Lake. Cement roads like chessboards have also been built in the factory area. Tall buildings such as the woodworking workshop, tool repair workshop, central laboratory, general warehouse, and model warehouse stand beside the roads. Many new factory buildings are under construction one after another, and many new machines are being installed. Some projects can be completed and put into production before the end of the year.

    建设中的武汉重型机床厂 
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    今年五、六月，在武汉展出的苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会上，有一台巨大的车床。它有七公尺高，六十七吨重，可以切削两公尺高、三点四公尺直径、二十吨重的大型物件。它虽然很大，但因为是由电控制的，所有的电扭、信号灯、温度计、压力表、液压变速手柄和选择花盘转数的图表等等，都集中在操纵台上，所以操作很方便。只要触动滑润电动机的开关，滑润油马上就输送到机床各部分去了。十八吨重的横梁，也只需按一下电扭，就可以移动到所需要的位置上。物件切削好了，刀架便自动停止移动。油路一旦堵塞，信号灯、电铃都先后发出警报。在温度超过摄氏六十度时，车床便自动停车。
    这台车床吸引了成千上万的观众。大家都为它的巨大的威力和新技术赞叹不已，把它称做“车床巨人”。但同时在大家的心上也留下一个问号：我国何时能生产这样巨大的机床呢？
    正在建设的武汉重型机床厂将来就要生产这种机床和比这更重、更大的机床！
    在我国工业建设中，要制造水力发电站的涡轮机和各种大型设备的大部件，都必须重型机床加工。在加工小部件时，为了提高工作效率，把几十个同样的部件集中起来一次加工，也需要重型机床。重型机床在我国工业建设中越来越重要。周恩来同志在“关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议的报告”中说：“努力发展机器制造工业，特别是发展我们所需要而又缺乏的各种重型设备、专用机床、精密机床和仪表等制造业，是今后工业建设的一个重点。”
    武汉重型机床厂是由苏联帮助我国建设的。它将生产重型而又精密的立式车床、卧式搪床、螺旋铣床、龙门铣床以及各类专用机床。
    这是一座具有万能性的现代设备的工厂。铸造是机器制造业中劳动最繁重的一个工种，而在这座工厂里，制模型将用抛砂机和造型机，铸件出模后有水力冲砂机清除砂子。为了适应技术复杂的生产，中央试验室将有各种各样的试验设备，还有用来透视加工物件内部的“爱克斯光”设备。
    这座工厂原来计划在1959年年底全部建成，1960年年初全面开工生产。但是，为了适应加速社会主义建设的需要，建厂的职工们在今年年初决定提前一年半完成建厂工程，即在1958年第二季度将工厂全部建成，同年第三季度全面开工生产。
    这个决定立即燃起了群众的热情，成为全体建厂人员的奋斗目标。承担这个工厂的大部分国内设计的中南工业建筑设计院的设计师们，提出了“不浪费一分钟”的口号，并尽量采用标准购件，积极挖掘潜力，提前三个月完成了三十一个项目的施工图设计。他们还在苏联专家指导下，将三股道的铁路改为一股道，简化了工程，为国家节约了十万八千元的投资。
    工厂设备供应科的同志们原来认为国内供应的许多设备，就同承制厂订了合同，规定了交货日期，不能提前交付。像通风机、天车等设备要等今年8月国外送来施工设计后才能订货，更不能提前交付。但是，当他们批判了“坐在办公室里叫困难”的思想作风以后，分头到各承制厂协商，各承制厂都热情地支援他们，原来有二百台机床提前交货，现在有一百九十八台都能提前交了。他们又根据苏联专家别兹斯维立的建议，一边根据技术设计提前订货，一边将订货单送给苏联设计单位，请设计单位将需要变更的设备的规格迅速修改寄来，使天车、通风机等设备也能按规格提前供应，还不致因为施工设计变更而造成积压。他们还从国家库存的设备中选用了三十二台重型机床，提前安装，为国家节约了七百多万元的外汇。
    第二季，当负责施工的中南第一工程公司的几千名职工正在为“提前一年半建成全厂”而紧张施工的时候，遇到了材料特别是钢筋不足的困难。苏联专家考倍联考马上同甲乙两方的技术员到广州去学习用竹筋混凝土代替钢筋混凝土的经验。回来后，他们马上在工地旁边搭起一座车间，专门生产竹筋。广州只将竹筋混凝土用来制作民用建筑的受力较小的楼板，他们经过试验以后，更进一步用来制作受力较大的楼板梁和楼梯，用来制作工业建筑的天窗侧面板和热电管道地沟盖板，他们几个月来一共生产了九十多万公尺的竹筋，用来代替了一百三十吨钢筋。他们还用竹脚手架代替木脚手架，用竹顶撑代替木顶撑，用竹模型板代替木模型板。许多附属企业的厂房和暂时性的建筑也是竹结构的。他们还推行了干硬性混凝土、冷拉钢筋等先进经验。今年，他们一共推行了三十多项节约材料的经验，克服了材料不足的困难，保证了工程按计划施工，同时还节约了二十多万元资金。
    这座工厂从去年9月开始进行平土工程以来，已经施工一年多了。一年前，这里还是一片丘陵地带，山丘上长着稀疏的杂草，梯田里结着金黄的谷穗，牛在池塘边饮水。现在，厂前区已建起了几十栋楼房，包括厂部办公大楼，职工宿舍，技工学校和实习工厂等等。从粤汉铁路分出的一条专用铁路，穿过淤泥很深的沙湖湖心，伸进了厂区。厂区里也筑起了棋盘似的水泥道路。木工厂房、工具修理厂房、中央试验室、总仓库和模型仓库等一座座高大的建筑，矗立在道路旁边。许多新的厂房陆续动工，许多新的机器正在安装。有些工程在年底以前就可以竣工投入生产了。（附图片）
