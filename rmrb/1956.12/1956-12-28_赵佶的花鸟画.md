Zhao Ji's Flower-and-Bird Paintings
　　Yu Fei'an
　　During the Ming Dynasty, people suspected whether Zhao Ji's paintings were truly his own work. Some devalued them, attempting to strip away the "sacred art" of this "Emperor Huizong," attributing it to contemporary masters like Wu Yuanyu. Others elevated its value, for instance, comparing Zhao Ji's "Returning Sails on Snowy River" to the works of the great Tang Dynasty painter Wang Wei.
　　In recent years, some connoisseurs have also held two views on Zhao Ji's paintings: one is that the clumsiest and worst paintings are likely Zhao Ji's genuine works; the other is that Zhao Ji could not possibly have painted so many and such good paintings, and they were probably all painted by famous artists in the court at the time.
　　When we study ancient paintings, especially Zhao Ji's paintings, we cannot separate his paintings from his calligraphy, and we must also combine his early, middle, and late calligraphy and paintings for research. Of course, bold suspicion is still permissible.
　　Now, based on the Zhao Ji's calligraphy that I have seen with verifiable dates, I will try to arrange them in order (including ink rubbings and stone inscriptions).
　　Zhao Ji at twenty-two years old wrote "Edict Bestowing Biyong" stone inscription, 1102 AD (Chongning first year, Renwu).
　　At twenty-seven years old, he inscribed "Genuine Work of Han Gan" and "Han Huang's Literary Garden Picture" "Eight Lines and Eight Penalties" stone inscriptions, 1107 AD (Daguan first year, Dinghai).
　　At twenty-eight years old, he wrote "Daguan Sacred Work Stele" stone inscription, 1108 AD (Daguan second year, Wuzi).
　　At thirty-two years old, he wrote the poem and preface to "Auspicious Cranes Painting," 1112 AD (Zhenghe second year, Ren Chen).
　　At thirty-four years old, he inscribed "Imperial Falcon Painting," 1114 AD (Zhenghe fourth year, Jiawu).
　　At thirty-nine years old, he wrote "Shenxiao Yuqing Wanshou Palace Stele" stone inscription, 1119 AD (Xuanhe first year, Ji Hai).
　　Zhao Ji's calligraphy—"Slender Gold Script"—has its own style. "Edict Bestowing Biyong" is simply stubbornly thin and hard, while the inscriptions on Han Gan, Han Huang, and "Eight Lines and Eight Penalties" show progress in the structure; the poem and preface to "Auspicious Cranes Painting" are not only more complete and fluent in form, but also more rounded in strokes, not simply stubbornly thin and hard; the inscription on "Imperial Falcon Painting" is even more vigorous; the writing on "Shenxiao Yuqing Wanshou Palace Stele" is even more ancient and robust. Judging from these calligraphic works with dated inscriptions alone, we can see his significant progress with age. But from the years of his twenty-second to thirty-ninth year, it can be seen that his calligraphy developed its own set of slender, forceful, and clear characteristics. Then, starting from the brushwork, how should we explain the claim that the clumsiest and worst paintings precisely contradict his calligraphy, being neither slender and forceful nor clear and sharp?
　　Zhao Ji's flower-and-bird paintings, based on what I have seen in these decades, including those that had not yet been exported at that time, and even including those without dates or with dates cut off, can very well show his continuous progress in artistic cultivation, creating his own style. Before they were exported, I saw a "Sketch of Rare Birds" scroll painted on twelve-plum paper, which included four sections of ink bamboo, which can be said to be unique. The literature says that he wrote bamboo "tight and dense without distinguishing shades of ink, all burnt ink, with faint white lines showing in the dense areas," these four sections of ink bamboo precisely prove the accuracy of the records. In this scroll, unless we completely deny the slender gold script, it is difficult to find any basis for claiming that the other flowers, plants, feathers, and fur are not painted by him. Here, I would also like to mention three other scrolls by Zhao Ji: "Auspicious Dragon Stone Painting" scroll (in the Palace Museum), "Auspicious Cranes Painting" scroll (in the Northeast Museum), and "Five-Colored Parrot Painting" scroll (now abroad). These are three "high-head scrolls" with different content, different forms, and similar sizes, half writing and half painting. From their content, we can very well see the basis for Song Cai Tao's "Iron Besieged Mountain Talks" and Deng Chun's "Painting Continued." He used double-hooking method and gorgeous forms to express the five-colored parrot and flowering apricots; in order to express the exquisite and translucent auspicious dragon stone, advancing to nine layers, he used the ink color form; in his "Auspicious Cranes Painting," when writing the auspicious gate and red towers of Bianjing (he used the ruler to show), in the invention of auspicious clouds (he used the boneless method to show), in sketching the white cranes (he used the double-hooking "filling green" to show), in these three scrolls, in terms of brush and ink, for example, the parrot's beak and claws, the apricot blossoms' flower branches, the stone's sharp edges and cun-dyeing, the twenty white cranes' feathers, beaks, and claws, etc., all reveal the same brushwork as his slender gold script, and are even close to his calligraphy in his thirties. These three scrolls, for our study of Zhao Ji's flowers and birds, I think are very useful. (Attached picture)

### 赵佶的花鸟画

    赵佶的花鸟画 
    于非闇
    明朝人怀疑赵佶的画是不是出自他一人之手：有的贬低其价值，企图把这位“徽宗皇帝”的“圣艺”抽空，归之于当代名手如吴元瑜之类；有的抬高其价值，例如把赵佶的“雪江归棹图”说成同唐代的大画家王维的作品一样。
    近年来，有些鉴赏家对赵佶的画也有两种看法：一种认为哪一幅画得最拙笨、最糟糕的，可能是赵佶的真迹；另一种认为赵佶根本不可能画这么多、这么好的画，大概都出于当时画院名手的代笔。
    我们研究古代绘画，特别是研究赵佶的绘画，不能把他的画同书法割裂开来，而且还要把他早期、中期和晚期的书画相互结合起来研究。当然喽，大胆的怀疑还是可以的。
    现在就我所见到的有年代可查的赵佶的书法，试给他排一下队（包括墨迹与石刻）。
    赵佶二十二岁书“赐辟雍诏”石刻，公元1102年（崇宁元年壬午）。
    二十七岁题“韩干真迹”和“韩滉文苑图”“八行八刑条”石刻，公元1107年（大观元年丁亥）。
    二十八岁书“大观圣作碑”石刻，公元1108年（大观二年戊子）。
    三十二岁书“瑞鹤图”诗并序，公元1112年（政和二年壬辰）。
    三十四岁题“御鹰图”，公元1114年（政和四年甲午）。
    三十九岁书“神霄玉清万寿宫碑”石刻，公元1119年（宣和元年巳亥）。
    赵佶的书法——“瘦金书”是有他自己的风格的。“赐辟雍诏”，只是一味的瘦硬，题韩干、韩滉和“八行八刑条”在间架结构上有了进步；书“瑞鹤图”诗并序，不但形体更完整流利了，而且笔道也圆融，不是一味的瘦硬；题“御鹰图”，则是更加雄健；书“神霄玉清万寿宫碑”，由雄健又更苍老。单从这些有年款的书法看，可以看出他随着年龄增长而有显著的进步。但是从他二十二岁到三十九岁这些年款上看，他书法成为瘦劲清利是有他自己的一套的。那末，姑从笔法出发，说他画成最拙笨、最糟糕的那幅画，正好和他的书法不相符合，既不瘦劲，也不清利，又该怎么说呢？
    赵佶的花鸟画，就我这几十年所见到的，包括那时尚未流出域外的，连不书年款或割去年款的在内，很可以看出他在艺术修养上不断的前进，创造出了他自己的风格。在未流出域外前，我所见到用十二梅纸画的“写生珍禽图”卷，在卷里画了四段墨竹，可以说只此一家，与众不同。在文献上说他写竹“紧密不分浓淡，一色焦墨，丛密处微露白道”，这四段墨竹，正好证明纪录的正确。这卷里其他的花木翎毛，除非把它的瘦金书也全盘否定，不然就很难找出不是他画的根据。在这里，我还想举出赵佶的另外三卷画来：“祥龙石图”卷（在故宫），“瑞鹤图”卷（在东北博物馆），“五色鹦鹉图”卷（现在域外）。这是三个不同内容、不同形式、而大小尺寸差不多、一半书一半画的“高头卷”。从它们的内容，很可以看出宋蔡绦“铁围山丛谭”和邓椿“画继”所记的依据。他使用双勾法和绚烂的形式，来表达五色鹦鹉和繁杏；他为了表达祥龙石的玲珑剔透，推进到九层，他就使用了墨彩的形式；他的“瑞鹤图”在写汴京的瑞门丹阙（他使用了界尺画来表现），在臆造祥云（他使用了没骨法来表现），在写生白鹤（他又使用双勾“填青”来表现），他在这三卷画中，用笔用墨方面，例如，鹦鹉的嘴爪、杏花的花朵枝干，石头的锋棱皴染，二十只白鹤的羽毛嘴爪等等，都呈露出和他瘦金书一样的笔法，更同他三十多岁时的书法相近。这三卷画，对于我们研究赵佶的花鸟，我想是很有用处的。（附图片）
