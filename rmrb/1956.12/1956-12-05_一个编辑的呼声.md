　　An Editor's Plea
　　Xiao Yemu
　　Recently, newspapers and periodicals have published many stories about editors arbitrarily changing articles. As an editor myself, I feel heavy-hearted when I read these. This isn't because my colleagues are being criticized, but because I feel that problems do exist in our editorial work. The kinds of things pointed out in the newspapers and periodicals, in my opinion, aren't a big deal. Among my colleagues, there are those who don't recognize "Cai Zhonglang" and change it to "Cai Langzhong," and those who don't know "wen chaogong" (plagiarist) and change it to "chao gongwen" (copy official documents). Some jokers even composed a rhyming couplet to go with it: "Wen chaogong takes up employment, copying official documents; Cai Zhonglang changes profession to become a physician." This kind of thing seems suitable for "A Grove of Laughs," but it's a fact.
　　Let's put aside talk like "limited editorial level" for now. If you don't understand, why not check or ask? If you don't check or ask, why not let the author see the changes? An article that arrives at the editorial department isn't reviewed and revised by just one person. There's a preliminary review, a secondary review, and a final review. After these three reviews, why is it still printed?
　　Clearly, these editors are ridiculous. But if the original manuscripts before typesetting in the editorial department were publicly exhibited, the audience would be shocked to find that some authors and translators are no less ridiculous than the editors.
　　I'm not clear about elsewhere, but regarding the publishing house where I work, I dare say that in four out of ten submissions, the authors and translators haven't even looked at their own work once after writing or translating it. The number of typos, grammatical errors, punctuation mistakes, mistranslations, and omissions in the original manuscripts is enough for professors teaching "grammar and rhetoric" to use them as error correction exercises for their students.
　　This is even more the case with translated manuscripts. Translating "the details of literary works" into "the parts of literary works," and "Jack London" into "London's Jack." Sentences like "Leaving a white square trace, the place where the frame used to hang is on the wall" also appear. Some people even leave spaces in the original manuscript and write in pencil beside them: "I can't understand this sentence after racking my brains. Please look it up in the dictionary and add the translation. Sorry for the trouble!" Others simply leave one or two pages blank and write: "Please translate this part, editor. This section of the original is difficult to understand, and I am rushing to translate other works commissioned by ×××× Publishing House, and I don't have time to think." As a result, things like this happen: a translated manuscript of 300,000 to 400,000 words, checked against the original by three people and revised in Chinese by four people, still has as many as thirty-nine obvious mistranslations after being printed. Another foreign work of 200,000 words was split into four parts and translated by four people. The four translators progressed simultaneously, and the four translations were sent to the editorial department one after another for "unification." As a result, several editors performed "assembly line" work, proofreading, revising, and supplementing. Because they were too busy, even people who didn't know foreign languages helped to unify the writing. This practice further encouraged some translators to cut corners, and "translation brokers" emerged. People who didn't understand foreign languages at all went to "co-translate" with others. These two collaborators are still in court in Shanghai over unequal distribution of royalties. It's worth noting that the translators mentioned above aren't all insignificant figures. Unfortunately, Mr. Wu Jingzi died too early.
　　Faced with such manuscripts, the editorial department's approach could be simpler—reject them. Why are editors so determined to check, translate, supplement, and revise everything, one by one? Is it to show off our editorial skills?
　　These things confuse me, and they also weigh heavily on my heart.
　　There are many reasons why such strange things happen. But one thing is clear: we editors, along with some authors and translators, don't acknowledge that a work is written by the writer, and the quality of the work depends on the writer's labor. A work should and must be (at least primarily) completed independently by the writer. A translation is translated by the translator, and the quality of the translation, as well as whether it is accurately translated, depends on the translator's labor. A translation should and must be (at least primarily) completed independently by the translator.
　　At the same time, we can't help but think about our current editorial work system and practices. No matter what you're doing, you must handle it according to its nature and characteristics. Running a factory has its own methods, and running a school has its own methods. The nature of the two is different, and the methods are also different. Only our editorial work seems to be able to disregard the nature and characteristics of creative labor (including translation), and the nature and characteristics of editorial work arising from it. This is the crux of the problem.
　　The editorial work of publishing houses is carried out according to "plans" and "production." The detail of the "system" and "plan" surpasses that of factories, and there are specialized agencies to oversee, urge, and inspect the matter.
　　When a "work" is still in the writer's mind, the editorial department must first formulate a complete "topic selection plan," similar to the planned targets for product types and production volume in a factory. Based on the "topic selection plan," it searches for "objects," solicits manuscripts everywhere, and signs "contracts" with authors and translators one by one, pre-paying "advances." The "contract" stipulates the number of words and the submission date. This isn't much different from ordering machinery. Setting the number of words and the submission time already makes it difficult for authors and translators. As for the quality of the work, the authors and translators probably can't guarantee it either. But the editorial department must, according to the "contract," set a "manuscript release plan," specifying the title, number of words, and main content. There are "annual plans," "quarterly plans," and "monthly plans." Even which day to release which manuscript must be predetermined. Before a book is published, Xinhua Bookstore decides the print run based on the "content introduction" of each book. It can be seen that the number of copies printed for the first edition is somewhat related to how well the "content introduction" is written.
　　Approaching the manuscript release date, but the manuscript hasn't arrived, things become tense. We have to rush the manuscript, using regular mail, airmail, long-distance calls, telegrams... all modern communication tools must be used. If it still doesn't come, there's nothing to do. We have to postpone the manuscript release, which is naturally the editor's dereliction of duty. Minor cases result in verbal criticism, while serious cases are put on the blackboard bulletin, and even recorded in the "year-end appraisal." "The plan is the law." It's no big deal to receive such punishment for not completing the plan.
　　Fortunately, the manuscript is rushed in, but it's close to the original release date. What to do? The solution is a "blitz." We even adopt the "assembly line method" that was once popular among construction workers, gathering the strength of several people to "process" the original manuscript, in order to complete the "manuscript release plan" on schedule. If we encounter a serious author or translator whose original manuscript is already a "finished product" and doesn't need editors to "process" it, the problem isn't too big. If it's a "semi-finished product" or an "unfinished masterpiece," then the editor suffers. The stuff "processed" in a "blitz" may not be good. The author and translator frown, the reader doesn't know what's going on, and of course they will scold, and the editor can only sigh.
　　I suspect that the above-mentioned editorial work system and methods wouldn't even work well for running a factory. Just using them to make a chair would probably result in it collapsing as soon as you sit on it; using them to make a pair of leather boots would make them awkward to wear. If there are no problems when used for editing, that would be strange. This method is indeed beneficial for printing houses that typeset books and bookstores that distribute books, enabling them to carry out "planned production." But we aren't printing books for the sake of printing books, or distributing books for the sake of distributing books!
　　Naturally, improving editorial work and raising the editorial level is ultimately the fundamental issue. An editor should be a knowledgeable person, and their level in certain areas should be higher than that of the writer, or at least not too far apart. But the current editors, except for a very few seniors, are all young people in their twenties and thirties. Their cultural level, knowledge, and professional skills are originally low, and their foundation in life is even shallower. How can they distinguish and judge a writer's work? In addition, the current editorial work system and methods make it impossible to squeeze out time for supplementary study and further education, and there is no opportunity to come into contact with the lives of the broad masses of workers and peasants (among our editors, there are not a few who have been confined to their desks and haven't left their homes for seven or eight years), nor can they spare time to study our work, or even have enough time to carefully ponder an original manuscript. Those who are responsible for some editorial administrative work have even their time for reading manuscripts squeezed out. Therefore, in reality, most of the manuscripts in the editorial department are handled by "assistant editors" and "trainee editors," including comrades who don't recognize "Cai Zhonglang" or know "wen chaogong." This seems like making rumors, but real things sometimes seem like fabrications.
　　Feeling the weight on our shoulders, it's inevitable to complain. Our predecessors outside the publishing industry often come to comfort and encourage us, saying that editors are meritorious and that editors are "unsung heroes." In fact, the reason why we complain isn't to contend for fame or gain, but because we feel that it's not easy to "want the horse to be good, but not let the horse eat grass," and that we need to thoroughly improve our editorial work system and methods, and that we need to handle things according to the nature and characteristics of editorial work.
　　We earnestly hope that comrades in charge of publishing affairs will temporarily put aside all kinds of "plans" and "reports" and come to the editorial department to listen to the voices of the editors.

### 一个编辑的呼声

　　一个编辑的呼声
　　萧也牧
    最近以来，报刊上登了不少编辑乱改文章的事。我也是编辑，看了心里总觉得沉重。这倒并非是因为同行受了指责的缘故，而是觉得我们的编辑工作中确实存在着问题。报刊上所指出的那类事，依我看是算不了什么的。在我的同行中，有人不识“蔡中郎”，而改作“蔡郎中”的，也有不知“文抄公”，而改作“抄公文”的。好事的人还编了付对联相赠：“文抄公就业抄公文，蔡中郎改行当郎中”。这种事，似乎可入“笑林广记”，然而，这是事实。
      “编辑水平所限”之类的话，暂不说他。自己不懂，为什么不查查问问？不查不问，改了又为什么不让作者看看？文章到了编辑部里，也不是一个人看了改了就算数的。审稿有初审、复审、终审，三审而后，为什么还把它印了出来？
    显然这些编辑是很荒唐的。可是当真把编辑部付排前的原稿公开展览一下，观众一定也会吃惊，原来某些作者、译者，其荒唐的程度并不小于编辑。
    旁处我不清楚，就我所服务的那个出版社的情形来看，来稿中，有十分之四，我敢说，作者译者写了译了之后，是连一遍也没看过的。原稿上别字之多，语法、标点错误之多，错译漏译之多，很有资格被讲授“语法修辞讲话”的先生们用来给学生作改正错误的习题。
    在译稿中更其如此。把“文学作品的细节”译成“文学作品的零件”，把“杰克伦敦”译成“伦敦的杰克”。“留着白色方形的痕迹过去悬挂过镜框的地方在墙上”之类的句子也出来了。甚至有人在原稿上留着空格，并在一旁用铅笔批道：“此句百思不得其解，请代查字典，补译填入。劳驾！”也有人索性整整空了一、二页，并在旁批示道：“请编辑同志代译。因此节原文较难理解，而我应××××社之约正在赶译旁的作品，苦于无思考的时间。”于是，这样的事就出来了：一部三四十万字的译稿，经三人校对原文，四人作中文修改，印出来以后，尚留有黑白性的错译达三十九处之多。也有一部二十万字的外国作品，拆作四份，由四人合译。四位译者齐头并进，四份译文先后送来由编辑部“统一”的。于是，好几位编辑进行了“流水作业”，校的校，改的改，补的补，忙不过来，连外国文字母也不甚了解的人也插一手，帮助统一文笔。这种做法，更助长了某些译者的偷工减料，于是“翻译掮客”，也出来了。根本不懂外文的也跑去和人“合译”了。这两位合作者，由于版税分配不均，直到现在还在上海人民法院里打官司。值得注意的是，以上所说的那些译者里边，也并不都是可以等闲视之的人物。可惜吴敬梓先生死得太早了。
    碰到这样的稿子，编辑部的办法本来可以简单一点——一退了之。当编辑的何以如此死心塌地地一一代查代译代补代改，难道是为了借此显显我们当编辑的本领？
    这样的事，使我感到困惑，也使我感到沉重。
    何以产生这等怪事，自然一言难尽。但有一点是很分明的，我们这些当编辑的，连同某些作者、译者在内，谁也不承认：作品是作家写的，作品质量的高低好坏，取决于作家的劳动。作品应该而且必须
  （至少是主要）是由作家独力完成的。译文是翻译家译的，译文质量高低以及是否译得准确，取决于翻译家的劳动。译文应该而且必须
  （至少是主要）由翻译家独力完成的。
    同时，也不能不联想到我们现行的编辑工作制度和作法。不论办什么事情，务必按事情的性质和特点来办。办工厂有办工厂的办法，办学校有办学校的办法。二者性质不同，办法也就各异。唯独我们的编辑工作，似乎可以不按创作（包括翻译）劳动的性质和特点，不按由此而产生的编辑工作的性质和特点来办，这是症结的所在。
    出版社的编辑工作是按“计划”“生产”的。“制度”“计划”之周详，比之工厂，实在有过之无不及，并设专门机构，主管催办检查其事。
    当“作品”还在作家肚里的时候，编辑部得事先拟定全部“选题计划”，类乎工厂生产品和生产量的计划指标。根据“选题计划”物色“对象”，四出约稿，一一和作者译者订好“合同”，预付“定洋”。“合同”上规定了字数，又规定了交稿的日期。这和定购什么机器的区别并不大。约定字数和交稿的时间，已经使作者、译者为难，至于作品的质量，恐怕作者、译者也是不敢保险的。但是编辑部却要根据“合同”，定一个“发稿计划”，书名、字数、内容大意，一一写明。既有“年度计划”，又有“季度计划”，还有“月度计划”，甚至哪天发哪本稿子，都要事先规定好的。书未出世，新华书店也就根据每本书的“内容介绍”决定了书的印数。可见初版书印的多少和“内容介绍”写得好坏是很有点儿关系的。
    临近发稿，而稿子迟迟不见来，这就紧张了。只好赶紧催稿，平信、航空信、长途电话、电报……近代各种通讯工具全得用上。催也不来，那也没法。只好延期发稿，这自然是编辑的失职。轻者口头批评，重者上黑板报，以至“年终鉴定”时，也要记上一笔。“计划即法律”，完不成计划而受到这种处分，这已经不算回事了。
    幸而稿件被催来了，但已迫近原定发稿期，那怎么办呢？办法是
  “突击”。甚至采用曾在建筑工人中流行一时的“流水作业法”，集数人之力，对原稿进行“加工”，以求如期完成“发稿计划”。遇到认真的作者、译者，原稿已是“成品”，无须编辑代劳“加工”，问题也就不大了。若是“半制品”或是“未完成的杰作”，这就苦了编辑。“突击”“加工”“加”出来的货色，也未必见佳。作者、译者皱眉，读者不知其中究竟，当然要骂，而编辑只能叹气了。
    以上所说的种种编辑工作的制度和办法，我疑心就是用来办工厂也是办不好的，就说用来做一只椅子，想必一坐就塌；用来做一双皮靴，穿了也要蹩脚；用之于编辑，若不出毛病，那倒是怪事了。这种办法，对排印书籍的印刷厂，对发行书籍的书店，确实有利于进行“计划生产”。但是，我们并不是为印书而印书，为发行书而发行书的呵！
    自然，改进编辑工作，提高编辑水平毕竟是根本问题。当编辑的应该是个博学的人，某些方面的水平应该高于作家，至少和作家的水平不致相差太远。但是，现在当编辑的，除了极少数的前辈而外，都是二三十岁的年轻人。文化、知识、业务水平原本很低，生活的根基更浅。凭什么去鉴别和判断一部作家的作品？加上现行的编辑工作的制度和办法，无法挤出时间来进行补习和进修，更没有机会去接触广大工农群众的生活（在我们编辑中，苦守写字台，七、八年不出家门一步者绝不是少数），也腾不出手来研究一下我们的工作，甚至没有充分时间从容地揣摩一部原稿。担负了一点编辑行政工作的，那么就连看稿子的时间也被挤掉了。因此，实际上编辑部里的稿件，大部分倒是“助理编辑”、“见习编辑”在处理，包括不识“蔡中郎”不知“文抄公”的同志在内。这似乎是在造谣，然而真实的事情，有时候看来倒像是捏造出来的。
    感到肩上的重量，难免要叫苦。我们出版界以外的前辈，倒也常来安慰我们，鼓励我们，说编辑是有功劳的，编辑是“无名英雄”。其实我们所以叫苦，并不在于争功名，而是觉得“又要马儿好，又要马儿不吃草”的事不好办，觉得需要彻底改进我们的编辑工作制度和方法，觉得需要按照编辑工作的性质和特点来办事。
    切盼主管出版事业部门的同志，暂时放一放手头种种“计划”和“报表”，到编辑部里来听听编辑的声音。
