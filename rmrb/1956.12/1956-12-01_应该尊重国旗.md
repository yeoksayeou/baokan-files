　　The National Flag Should Be Respected
    In Anhui, there is a phenomenon of disrespect for the national flag. For example, many units do not have a fixed time for raising and lowering the flag, and they do not lower the flag when it gets dark. When raising and lowering the flag, many people's attitudes are not serious, running around in the venue, and some even smoking cigarettes. Many stores, production cooperatives, and production teams also embroider the words "×× Store" or "×× Cooperative" below the five-pointed stars of the national flag. Agricultural production cooperatives often use raising and lowering the flag as a signal to direct farmers to start and end work or take breaks during drought resistance and flood drainage.

　　应该尊重国旗
    在安徽，存在着不尊重国旗的现象。比如很多单位升降旗都没有固定的时间，天黑了也不把国旗降下来。在升降旗时，很多人的态度不严肃，在场里跑来跑去，有的人还抽着香烟。很多商店、生产社、生产队在国旗五角星的下面，还绣上“××商店”、“××社”的字样。农业生产合作社在抗旱排涝中，常常以升降旗为信号，指挥农民上下工或休息。　张鱼
