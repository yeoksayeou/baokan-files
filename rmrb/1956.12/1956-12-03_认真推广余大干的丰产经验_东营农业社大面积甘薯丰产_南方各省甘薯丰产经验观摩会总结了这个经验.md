Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, December 2nd: The Dongying Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dongying Township, Fuqing County, Fujian Province, led by young farmer Yu Dagan, is estimated to have a total output of more than 10,020,000 jin of sweet potatoes from its 2,300 mu of land this year, a twofold increase compared to last year. This achievement was made after the cooperative adopted the high-yield sweet potato experience of its director, Yu Dagan, and promoted it on a large scale. This year, the entire Dongying Township has been cooperativized, creating favorable conditions for promoting advanced yield-increasing experiences. More than 1,100 mu of the 2,300 mu of sweet potato fields in the Dongying Agricultural Cooperative were cultivated according to the high-yield sweet potato experience created by Yu Dagan.

Yu Dagan is a famous sweet potato yield-increasing model in Fujian Province and a national youth socialist construction activist. In 1952, he experimented with improving the soil, meticulously cultivating the land to create large ridges, and applying fertilizer in stages and layers in seven fen of land to cultivate sweet potatoes. As a result, he harvested 7,350 jin of sweet potatoes, which would be 10,500 jin per mu, equivalent to eight times the average yield of 1,300 jin per mu in Fujian Province. In 1953, Yu Dagan further created a high-yield record of an average yield of 12,500 jin of sweet potatoes per mu in 1.2 mu of high-yield fields. In 1954, despite suffering from drought, an average of 11,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu was still harvested from 1.1 mu of land. In 1955, the cooperative further developed sweet potato production in 53 mu of sweet potato fields with different soil qualities, resulting in a yield increase of one to three times compared to previous years. The highest-yielding plot, 1.9 mu, averaged more than 12,300 jin per mu. Dongying Township, where Yu Dagan is located, is a coastal village with little land and poor soil, with an average of only seven fen of land per person. For a long time, it has been short of grain. This year's bumper sweet potato harvest can solve the problem of insufficient grain.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, December 2nd: The Ministry of Agriculture held a Southern Provinces Sweet Potato Bumper Harvest Experience Observation Meeting in Fuqing County, Fujian Province, in late November.

After young farmer Yu Dagan of Dongying Township, Fuqing County, created a high-yield record of producing 10,000 jin of large sweet potatoes per mu in a small area in 1952, he continued to maintain this high yield for four consecutive years in small and larger areas. Yu Dagan's high-yield experience has been successfully promoted on a large scale in various parts of Fujian Province this year, with most areas experiencing a yield increase of one to two times compared to previous years. The Ministry of Agriculture organized 162 people to observe in Fuqing County, including agricultural yield-increasing models, agricultural technicians, and experts from agricultural science research institutes in East China, South China, and Southwest China specializing in sweet potato research from major sweet potato producing areas in Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Fujian provinces.

Here, they listened to the experience introduction from Yu Dagan, director of the Dongying Agricultural Cooperative in Dongying Township and the creator of the "10,000-jin large sweet potatoes," and carefully observed the sweet potato high-yield fields of the Dongying Agricultural Cooperative and the demonstration of the complete set of cultivation processes for cultivating "10,000-jin large sweet potatoes" by the cooperative members. This year, Dongying Cooperative has 129 mu of high-yield sweet potato fields, with a yield of 8,000 to 10,000 jin per mu. In front of the observation representatives, the cooperative members dug up a 5.449 fen high-yield field on the spot, and the weight of the dug-up sweet potatoes was 4,613 jin. The observation representatives also went to the high-yield fields of Dongguang Cooperative and Nanzhai Cooperative for observation. Although the natural conditions and soil properties of these two cooperatives were different from those of Dongying Cooperative, the sweet potatoes cultivated using Yu Dagan's high-yield experience also increased by one or two or three times compared to previous years.

The observation representatives unanimously believed that Yu Dagan's high-yield experience is mature, universal, and reliable, and can be promoted in various southern provinces in accordance with local conditions. The technical research group, composed of sweet potato experts and agricultural technicians from the observation group, summarized Yu Dagan's sweet potato high-yield experience and also put forward suggestions for improvement in response to the shortcomings of his sweet potato cultivation.

    认真推广余大干的丰产经验
　　东营农业社大面积甘薯丰产
　　南方各省甘薯丰产经验观摩会总结了这个经验
    新华社福州2日电　由青年农民余大干领导的福建省福清县东营乡东营农业生产合作社，今年全社二千三百多亩甘薯总产量估计可达到一千零二万多斤，比去年增产一倍。这是这个社采用社主任余大干甘薯高额丰产经验，在大面积推广后所获得的成就。今年东营乡全乡合作化，为推广先进增产经验创造了有利条件。东营农业社全社二千三百多亩甘薯田里有一千一百多亩按照余大干创造的甘薯高额丰产经验来培育的。
    余大干是福建省著名的甘薯增产模范，全国青年社会主义建设积极分子，1952年他在七分田里试验改良土壤、精耕整地培大畦、分期分层集中施肥等办法来培育甘薯，结果收了七千三百五十斤甘薯，如果折成一亩，将是一万零五百斤，相等于福建全省甘薯每亩平均产量一千三百斤的八倍。1953年，余大干在一亩二分丰产田里进一步创造了平均每亩收一万二千五百斤甘薯的高额丰产纪录。1954年的一亩一分地，虽然遭到旱灾，但平均每亩还收一万一千斤甘薯。1955年，社里在五十三亩不同土质的甘薯田里进一步发展甘薯生产，结果比往年增产一倍到三倍，产量最高的一丘一亩九分田，平均每亩收一万二千三百多斤。余大干所在的东营乡，是滨海乡村，地少贫瘠，平均每人只七分田。长期以来这里一直是缺粮的。今年全乡甘薯大丰收，可以解决粮食不足的困难。
    新华社福州2日电　农业部11月下旬在福建省福清县举行了南方各省甘薯丰产经验观摩会。
    福清县东营乡青年农民余大干在1952年创造了小面积的每亩产万斤大甘薯的高额丰产纪录后，又连续四年在小面积和较大面积上保持了这个高额产量。余大干的丰产经验，今年在福建省各地大面积推广后，都获得了成功，大部分可比往年增产一倍到二倍。这次农业部组织到福清县观摩的，有浙江、安徽、江西、湖南、湖北、广东、广西、四川和福建等省的主要甘薯产地的农业增产模范、农业技术人员和华东、华南、西南等农业科学研究所研究甘薯的专家等共一百六十二人。
    在这里，他们听了东营乡东营农业社主任和“万斤大甘薯”的创造者余大干的经验介绍，详细观摩了东营农业社的甘薯丰产田和社员们所做的培育“万斤大甘薯”的整套耕作栽培过程的表演。东营社今年有一百二十九亩甘薯丰产田，每亩产量可达八千斤到一万斤。社员们在观摩代表面前当场开挖了一块五分四厘九的丰产田，挖出的甘薯过秤结果，产量是四千六百一十三斤。观摩代表还到东光社和南宅社的丰产田观摩，这两个社的自然条件和土壤性质和东营社虽不相同，但是采用余大干丰产经验来培育的甘薯，也都比往年增产一倍或二、三倍。
    观摩代表一致认为余大干的丰产经验是成熟的，具有普遍性和可靠性，可以在南方各省因地制宜地推广。由观摩团中的甘薯专家、农业技术人员组成的技术研究组，总结了余大干的甘薯丰产经验，同时也针对他培育甘薯的缺点，提出了改进意见。
