"Seminars" and Others
Zhang Daben

Comrade Yan Xiu, in his article "From 'Seminar' to 'Blaji'" (see People's Daily, August 29), raised a noteworthy issue: how to correctly treat foreign words in Chinese. I support the call for a rigorous attitude towards foreign words because, as Comrade Yan Xiu said, "we have not fully utilized the possibilities that our mother tongue has for expressing modern things and foreign things." Today, we should oppose the indiscriminate use of foreign words without need. However, I believe that any linguistic phenomenon should be specifically analyzed before drawing conclusions. Comrade Yan Xiu believes that the appearance of words like "Seminar" and "Blaji" "seems like a divine object falling from the sky," and that some people are "desperately creating chaos and trampling on the language of the motherland." Therefore, he expresses "firm opposition to this nonsense" and calls for "whipping this ugly phenomenon." I have doubts about this proposition.

First, there is the question: are the direct transliteration of some foreign scientific and technical terms, which have a relatively narrow scope of application and have only recently been introduced into China, and for which suitable equivalent terms cannot be found in Chinese for the time being, considered nonsense? "Seminar" can be regarded as a term in teaching methods. It refers to a form of practical class in universities conducted in groups under the guidance of a teacher (usually manifested as a prepared thematic discussion led by the teacher; it is now generally translated as "classroom discussion"; sometimes the group for thematic discussion is also called "Seminar"). I think transliteration is acceptable. Since the thing is new, there may be different translations coexisting at the same time, and after the test of time, a more appropriate translation will naturally emerge. If one feels "more angry than going to a foreign prison" simply because one does not understand, this is inevitably a sign of being a bit of a bumpkin. People who have not studied political economy find it difficult to understand what "cartel," "syndicate," "trust," and "concern" are. Of course, it looks unpleasant if you don't understand, but that's okay, you will naturally understand after studying it. It is probably still difficult to find more appropriate and self-explanatory translations for words like "cartel."

Second, what standard should be used to measure whether this or that language phenomenon is healthy? I believe that the people are the creators and users of language, and the choice of a certain language phenomenon by the broad masses of the people should also be regarded as a standard. Today, words like penicillin, combine, and motorcycle have been quite widely used (and therefore they appear in various newspapers and periodicals). Therefore, even if they express the same things as penicillin, combine harvester, and mechanical bicycle, the former's legitimate status in Chinese should be recognized. Today, even old women in small towns go to cooperative stores to buy "Blaji" for their daughters (this is indeed what the author himself heard). Since the purpose of communication can be achieved, why must we say "women's dress" or "Western-style dress"? Since we can say "khaki" and "biji," why is saying "vanerdin" considered "nonsense"? Does calling all fabrics plain weave, twill, and cross weave prevent "confusion"?

Third, I think we should separate dialect phenomena from literary language phenomena. If words like "Kvas" and "Lieba" (bread) flood national newspapers and periodicals, I also advocate "whipping." However, if the people of a certain area know these words, use them, or if they appear in shop windows and store signs, it seems unnecessary to launch a punitive expedition. Some cities in Northeast China call bread "Lieba." Although this is a foreign word, it is just like some places call steamed buns "Bobo" and "Mo," and potatoes "Yangyu" and "Tudou." They are dialect phenomena. Is calling steamed buns "Bobo" and potatoes "Yangyu" and "Tudou" all "nonsense"?

Finally, although I do not work as a translator, I would like to say a few words for translators. Translators themselves have an undeniable responsibility for the low quality of translation. Low quality is not only related to the translators' preparations in various aspects, but also to the organization and leadership of translation work. For a long time, there have been no publications in the translation community for exchanging experiences and learning, and no one has managed the standardization of various translations. I sincerely hope that relevant parties can correctly treat translation talents, value their labor, understand their actual difficulties, and help them improve. They need well-intentioned, comradely criticism and guidance. Please pour less cold water and, even more so, don't be sarcastic. Translation has a direct responsibility for the standardization of Chinese, and translators should demand more of themselves. However, it must also be pointed out that the existence of many linguistic phenomena is not all caused by "the one-sided remarks of 'genius' translators," as Comrade He Ju said in his article "Starting from 'Associate Doctor'" (see People's Daily, September 23). Comrade translators should remember Comrade He Ju's advice: "First, we must clarify the original meaning of a word, otherwise, spreading errors will harm people greatly." I think this sentence also applies to critics and editors. Facts have proven that the meaning of "Seminar" is not as Comrade Yan Xiu explained it, and it does not mean "self-study." Comrade He Ju also misunderstood the Associate Doctor ("Candidate"). Comrade He Ju said: "In the Soviet Union, graduation from graduate school is an Associate Doctor, or translated as 'Candidate Doctor'. In short, it is related to a doctorate. In fact, Soviet graduate students are only called 'Candidate' (кандидат), meaning that they are qualified to apply for doctoral dissertation examinations to obtain a doctoral degree." As far as I know, in the Soviet Union, "Candidate" is a degree lower than a doctorate. Not all graduate students are "Candidates" after graduation. Only those who pass the degree examination and dissertation defense can be awarded the "Candidate" degree by the state. Whether translating "Candidate" as "Associate Doctor" or "Candidate Doctor" is "unworthy of the name," or whether translating it as "Master" is the only appropriate translation, is still debatable. However, let's not draw conclusions first, and let's not put on labels first. I would like to take this opportunity to advise critics that when criticizing translations, it is best to "clarify the original meaning of a word" first.

Editor's Note: After "From 'Seminar' to 'Blaji'" and "Starting from 'Associate Doctor'" were published, the editorial department received some submissions and letters raising different opinions on foreign words and translation issues. We are now publishing one article as a correction to these two articles. However, we believe that Comrade He Ju's views in "Starting from 'Associate Doctor'" on some of the problems existing in the current graduate student system are worthy of attention. We have also received some letters expressing support for Comrade He Ju's article exposing and criticizing the unreasonable phenomena in the current graduate student system. We have forwarded these letters to the relevant departments, urging them to study and resolve them.

    “习明纳尔”及其他
    张大本
    严秀同志在“从‘习明纳尔’到‘布拉吉’”一文中（见8月29日人民日报）提出了一个值得注意的问题：如何正确地对待汉语中的外来词。我支持以严谨的态度对待外来词的呼吁，因为，正像严秀同志所说的那样，“我们还没有充分利用我们祖国语言文字所具有的表达现代事物和外来事物的可能性”。今天应当反对不问需要地滥用外来词。但我认为，对任何语言现象应当先进行具体分析，然后再作结论也不迟。严秀同志认为，“习明纳尔”、“布拉吉”等词的出现“好像是天外飞来了一件什么神物”，是有些人“拼命地在那里制造混乱，蹧蹋祖国的语言文字”，因此，他表示“坚决反对这种胡闹”，而且呼吁“对这种丑恶的现象进行鞭挞”。我对于这种提法表示怀疑。
    首先，有这样一个问题：有些外来的科学技术方面的专门用语，它们的应用范围比较狭窄，又传入中国不久，在汉语中一时找不到恰当的等义词，直接译音，算不算是胡闹？“习明纳尔”可以算是教学法中的一个名词，它是指高等学校里在教师领导下分组进行的一种实践课的方式说的（通常表现为教师主持下的有准备的专题讨论，目前一般已译为“课堂讨论”；有时把专题讨论的小组也叫作“习明纳尔”）。我觉得，音译过来是可以的。既然事物是新的，就可能有不同的译法同时并存，经过时间的考验，自然会产生出比较恰当的译法来。如果只因为自己不懂，而感到“比进洋监还要叫人生气”，这未免是少见多怪了。没学过政治经济学的人，很难弄清什么是“卡特尔”、“辛迪加”、“托拉斯”、“康采恩”。不懂，看起来当然不顺眼，这没关系，学了之后自然会懂的。像“卡特尔”之类的词，目前恐怕还很难找出更恰当的使人一目了然的译名来。
    其次，拿什么标准来衡量这种或那种语言现象是否健康？我觉得，人民是语言的创造者和使用者，应当把广大人民群众对某种语言现象的选择也当作一个标准。今天，配尼西林、康拜因、摩托车这些词已被相当广泛地使用（因而它们也就出现在各种报刊上），那么，即使它们和青霉素、联合收割机、机械脚踏车同是表达一样的事物，也应当承认前者在汉语中的合法地位。今天连小城镇里的老大娘都要到合作商店给女儿买“布拉吉”（这确是笔者自己听到过的）。既然能够达到交际的目的，为什么一定非要说“女装连衣裙”，或“西式连衣衫”呢？既然能够说“咔叽”、“毕叽”，为什么说“凡尔丁”就是“胡闹”？难道把所有的布都叫作平纹布、斜纹布、十字布就不会“混乱”了吗？
    第三，我认为应当把方言现象和文学语言现象分开来看。在全国性的报刊上如果泛滥着“葛瓦斯”、“列巴”（面包）一类的词，我也主张“鞭挞”。但是，假如某一地区的人民知道这些词，使用它们，或者，它们出现在橱窗里，市招上，好像也用不着大兴问罪之师。东北某些城市把面包叫作“列巴”，虽然这是一个外来词，但它正和有的地方把馒头叫“饽饽”、“馍”，把马铃薯叫“洋芋”、“土豆”一样，是方言现象，难道把馒头叫“饽饽”，把马铃薯叫“洋芋”、“土豆”都是“胡闹”不成？
    最后，虽然我不做翻译工作，却很想替翻译工作者说几句话。翻译质量不高，翻译工作者本身有不可推卸的责任。质量低，这不仅和翻译工作者的各方面准备有关系，也和对翻译的组织领导工作有关系。长期以来，翻译界没有交流经验、学习的刊物，各种译名译法的规范工作也没人管理。很希望有关方面能够正确对待翻译人材，重视他们的劳动，体谅他们的实际困难，帮助他们提高。他们需要善意的、同志式的批评和教导。请少泼冷水，更不要冷嘲热讽。翻译对汉语规范化工作有直接的责任，翻译工作者应当更严格地要求自己。但是，也必须指出，许多语言现象的存在，也并不都是像何居同志在“从‘副博士’谈起”一文中（见9月23日人民日报）所说的那样，“只凭‘天才’翻译家的一面之辞”造成的。翻译同志们应当记住何居同志的忠告：“先要把一个字的原义弄清楚，否则以讹传讹，害人不浅”。我觉得，这句话也同样适用于批评家以及编辑。事实证明，“习明纳尔”的意思并不像严秀同志所解释的那样，它不当“自修”讲。何居同志也把副博士（“堪及达”）理解错了。何居同志说：“在苏联，研究生毕业就是副博士，或译‘候补博士’，总之，是与博士有关。其实，苏联研究生毕业只称‘堪及达’（кандидат），意思是说，是一位有资格提出博士论文申请考试来取得博士学位的人”。据我所知，在苏联“堪及达”是次于博士的一种学位，并不是研究生毕业之后都是“堪及达”，只有经过学位考试和论文答辩合格的人，才能由国家授予“堪及达”学位。把“堪及达”译成“副博士”或
  “候补博士”是否“名不副实”，还是只有译成“硕士”才恰到好处，还大可争论，但是，结论先不要下，帽子也先不必戴。我愿意借此机会奉劝批评家们，在批评翻译的时候，也最好先把“一个字的原义弄清楚”。
    编者附记：“从‘习明纳尔’到‘布拉吉’”和“从‘副博士’谈起”发表后，编辑部曾接到一些来稿、来信，就外来词和译名问题提出了不同意见。现选登一篇，作为对这两篇文章的补正。但何居同志的“从‘副博士’谈起”一文中对目前研究生制度中存在的一些问题的意见，我们认为是值得重视的。我们也接到一些来信，表示赞同何居同志文章中对目前研究生制度中的不合理现象的揭露和批评，我们已将这些来信转交有关部门，敦促他们加以研究解决。
