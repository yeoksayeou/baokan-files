　　布达佩斯——莫斯科
　　旅客列车恢复通车
    据新华社布达佩斯4日电　布达佩斯和莫斯科之间的正常旅客列车来往已经恢复。从布达佩斯开往莫斯科的火车每天清晨开出，从莫斯科方面来的列车每天正午到达。但是，同华沙、布拉格和布加勒斯特之间的旅客列车还没有通行。
    布达佩斯的市内交通也有了进一步的进展。12月3日，这里已经有四十一条有轨电车、一条无轨电车线路和二十五条公共汽车线路恢复行驶，其中有二十一条有轨电车线路全线通行。在这一天，首都的出租汽车公司开出的汽车达到了三百七十辆之多。现在，工人们正在继续加紧修复其它的电车线路，以便使布达佩斯的交通不仅在主要街道上而且在次要的街道上都尽速恢复。
    布达佩斯的剧院已经恢复演出。其中木偶剧院已经演了一场，下周还将演出一场。小型剧院也将进行演出，其中喜剧剧院和杂剧院将在这个月下半月开始演出。
