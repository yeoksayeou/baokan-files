Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 20th: At the invitation of the Czechoslovak National Assembly, the delegation of the National People's Congress of China, headed by Peng Zhen, attended the plenary session of the Czechoslovak National Assembly which opened on the 19th, accompanied by Cao Ying, the Chinese Ambassador to Czechoslovakia. The session, which began this morning, discussed several bills proposed by the government.

Peng Zhen, the head of the Chinese People's Congress delegation, delivered a speech at the session.

The Chairman of the Czechoslovak National Assembly, Fierlinger, first delivered a speech welcoming the delegation to attend the meeting.

Fierlinger said that People's China is an example of implementing a policy of peace and democracy. The unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union has become a strong force in the worldwide struggle for peace. The unlimited growth of China's prestige in the world and its role in Asia are also extremely important factors in the cause of peace and progress in Europe. The meaningful appearance of People's China on the international political stage can only be compared with the great fact of the discovery of nuclear energy in science.

He then said: In our friendly talks and discussions with the guests, we have once again clarified the complete agreement of our views in further developing our mutual relations and resolving major international political issues. In the common effort to strive for world peace, in the closest friendship with the Soviet Union and other countries of the great socialist camp, we will continue to strive for mutual assistance and cooperation.

Next, Peng Zhen delivered a speech. He first thanked the entire people of Czechoslovakia for their profound friendship with the Chinese people, and expressed warm congratulations on the great achievements that the Czechoslovak people have achieved and will achieve. He once again praised Czechoslovakia's support for the socialist cause in Hungary, and its support for the Soviet Union's assistance to the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government and the Hungarian people, as well as its position and actions in supporting Egypt's struggle against aggression.

After introducing the achievements made by the Chinese people and the current tasks, Peng Zhen continued: The imperialists are very unhappy with the great achievements of our socialist countries. They are always trying in every possible way to sabotage our cause and vainly attempt to "liberate" us, that is, to carry out subversive activities against the socialist countries where the working people are the masters of the house. They spread rumors and slanders against us, saying that socialist countries are not good in this way or that way, not free in this way or that way, and describe their financial oligarchy kingdom as a "free country" and a "free world." However, these financial oligarchy overlords and their lackeys never dare to make clear what kind of democracy and what kind of freedom they are talking about, whose democracy and whose freedom. Is it the freedom of imperialism to enslave weak nations? Or the freedom of anti-colonialism? Is it the freedom of imperialism to carry out subversive and destructive activities against socialist countries? Or the freedom to defend the socialist system and build socialism? Is it the freedom of the financial oligarchs to barbarously and cruelly exploit the surplus value of workers and exploit the blood and sweat of all other working people, and the freedom to oppress and persecute the working people? Or the freedom to resist exploitation, eliminate exploitation, eliminate classes, and establish a socialist society? Is it the freedom to arbitrarily drive millions upon millions of workers into the streets and make them starve and freeze? Or the freedom of the working people to be the masters of their own affairs, to carry out creative labor, and to continuously improve their material and cultural lives on the basis of production development? Comrades! Friends! We are very sorry, but the former freedom is indeed not available here. It is not available now, and probably never will be again. In our socialist countries, there can only be the latter freedom, the latter democracy, that is, the freedom and democracy of the working class and the entire people. For the imperialists, for the financial oligarchy overlords and their lackeys, for the war-mongers and their secret agents and spies, there is no freedom, nor should they be given any freedom.

Peng Zhen said, unity is strength. We must strengthen unity within each of our socialist countries. We must strengthen unity among all socialist countries led by the Soviet Union, and we must strengthen unity among all socialist countries and all nationally independent countries and all peace-loving countries and peoples. As long as all the peace-loving and democratic forces in the world unite, lasting world peace will be guaranteed, the development of the progressive cause of mankind will be guaranteed, and the safe and happy life of mankind will be guaranteed. This kind of unity is also our most fundamental and greatest interest. We should cherish it and constantly strengthen it as we cherish the pupils of our eyes.

After Peng Zhen finished his speech, all the members of the Czechoslovak National Assembly stood up, applauding for a long time, and repeatedly shouting "Long live People's China!"

    加强社会主义各国团结　保卫人类进步事业
    彭真应邀在捷国民议会上发表演说
    新华社布拉格20日电　应捷克斯洛伐克国民议会的邀请，中国全国人民代表大会代表团19日下午在中国驻捷克斯洛伐克大使曹瑛陪同下列席了19日开幕的捷克斯洛伐克国民议会全体会议。这次会议是从今天上午开始的，讨论了政府所提出的几个法案。
    中国人民代表大会代表团团长彭真在会上发表了演说。
    捷克斯洛伐克国民议会主席费林格首先致词，欢迎代表团参加会议。
    费林格说，人民中国是执行和平民主政策的榜样。中国和苏联之间的牢不可破的友谊成了全世界争取和平事业中的坚强力量。中国在世界上威信的无限增长和它在亚洲的作用也是欧洲的和平和进步事业中的极为重要的因素。人民中国在国际政治舞台上的有意义的出现，只有科学中发现核子能的伟大事实才能与之相比。
    他接着说：我们在同客人的友好谈话和座谈中，再一次地明确了在进一步发展我们相互之间的关系和解决国际重大政治问题方面我们观点的完全一致。在争取世界和平的共同努力中，在同苏联和伟大的社会主义阵营的其他国家的最亲密的友谊中，我们将继续努力相互帮助和合作。
    接着，彭真发表了演说。他首先感谢捷克斯洛伐克全体人民对中国人民的深厚友谊，并对捷克斯洛伐克人民所获得的及将获得的伟大成就表示热烈祝贺。他再一次赞扬捷克斯洛伐克支持匈牙利的社会主义事业，支持苏联对匈牙利工农革命政府和匈牙利人民的援助和支持埃及反抗侵略的斗争的立场和行动。
    彭真介绍了中国人民取得的成就和当前的任务后接着说，帝国主义者是十分不喜欢我们社会主义各国的伟大成就的。他们总是千方百计地对我们的事业进行破坏，并且妄想“解放”我们，即对劳动人民当家做主的社会主义国家进行颠覆活动。他们造谣诬蔑我们，说社会主义国家这样不好那样不好，这样不自由那样不自由，而把他们的金融寡头王国说成是“自由国家”、“自由世界”。可是，这些金融寡头老爷和他们的走狗们却总是不敢说清楚他们所说的究竟是什么民主、什么自由，是谁的民主、谁的自由。是帝国主义奴役弱小民族的自由呢？还是反殖民主义的自由呢？是帝国主义对社会主义国家进行颠覆破坏活动的自由呢？还是保卫社会主义制度建设社会主义的自由呢？是金融寡头野蛮的、残酷的榨取工人的剩余价值和榨取其他一切劳动人民血汗的自由和压迫、迫害劳动人民的自由呢？还是反抗剥削消灭剥削、消灭阶级、建立社会主义社会的自由呢？是把成百万成千万的工人任意驱逐到街头，使他们挨饿受冻的自由呢？还是劳动者当家作主进行创造性劳动，在生产发展的基础上不断改善物质文化生活的自由呢？同志们！朋友们！我们抱歉得很，在我们这里，前一种自由确实是没有的。现在没有，大概永远也不会再有。在我们社会主义各国中有的只能是后一种自由，后一种民主，即工人阶级和全体人民的自由民主。对于帝国主义者，对于金融寡头老爷和他们的走狗们，对于战争贩子和他们的特务间谍们来说是没有自由、也不应给他们任何自由的。
    彭真说，团结就是力量。我们每一个社会主义国家内部要加强团结。我们以苏联为首的社会主义各国之间要加强团结，所有社会主义国家和所有民族独立国家和一切爱好和平的国家和人民之间要加强团结。只要世界所有的和平民主势力团结起来，世界的持久和平就有了保障，人类进步事业的发展，人类的安全幸福的生活就有了保障。这种团结也是我们最根本和最大的利益。我们应该像爱护眼珠一样地爱护它和不断地加强它。
    彭真演说结束后，捷克斯洛伐克国民议会议员全体起立，经久不息地鼓掌，并且再三地高呼“人民中国万岁！”
