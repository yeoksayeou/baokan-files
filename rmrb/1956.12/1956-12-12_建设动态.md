Construction Updates

    Factory for Manufacturing Rayon Pulp
    Xinhua News Agency reports: The state-owned Kaishantun Paper Mill on the banks of the Tumen River has recently begun renovating a rayon pulp factory.
    The silk woven from rayon pulp is particularly bright and beautiful. Fishing nets made of rayon are also very strong and durable. A car tire made with cotton yarn as the cord fabric will delaminate and become unusable after traveling 25,000 kilometers, while a car tire made with rayon as the cord fabric can travel 50,000 to 100,000 kilometers. Rayon pulp can also be used to manufacture nitrocellulose for use in film, car paint, etc.
    This factory will be renovated and completed by the end of next year and will be able to produce 20,000 tons of rayon pulp annually.
    Factory Using Broken Fishing Nets as Raw Material
    This newspaper reports: The Wenzhou Flax Textile Factory, which uses broken fishing nets as raw materials to weave beautiful rugs, is about to begin construction.
    Using broken fishing nets as textile raw materials is an innovation in our country. Li Zhisheng, an ordinary worker at the Wenzhou Welfare Flax Textile Factory, was the first to discover and successfully trial-produce white tablecloths and canvas from broken fishing nets.
    The coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian can collect about 1.5 million jin of broken nets every year, which can fully meet the factory's production needs. In the past, these broken fishing nets were burned by fishermen for cooking or discarded and left to rot on the islands. (Hu Wenhuan)
    Nanping-Fuzhou Railway Begins Laying Tracks
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanping, December 11: The Nanping-Fuzhou Railway, which is under construction, began its first phase of track laying from Nanping on the 10th.
    The Nanping-Fuzhou Railway is 173 kilometers long and is the second railway in Fujian Province. It connects with the Nanping to Waiyang branch line and the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway. Currently, 50% of the earthwork has been completed along the entire line, and 40% of the bridge and culvert construction has been completed.
    Yunnan Has a Granular Fertilizer Factory
    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 11: Yunnan Province's first granular fertilizer factory was recently completed in Kunming. Construction of this factory began in the fourth quarter of last year. During the factory construction, the production department also carried out product trial production. So far, eighty tons of fertilizer have been produced.
    In the past, the chemical fertilizers used in Yunnan had to be transported by car from Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places, so the price was higher and the quantity was small. After this factory is put into production, it can produce more than 2,000 tons of granular fertilizer every year. Soon, the villages near Kunming will be able to use inexpensive granular fertilizer.
    Transmission Line Over the Huai River
    Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, December 11: The seventeen-kilometer-long high-voltage transmission line over the Huai River from the Fozi Ridge Hydropower Station to the Mozitan Reservoir construction site has been completed and began transmitting electricity on the evening of the 8th.
    The Mozitan Reservoir is located on the eastern source of the Pi River, the largest tributary of the Huai River in Huoshan County, Anhui Province, and is a newly started project on the Huai River this year. Because the existing power generation equipment at the reservoir construction site is scarce, the power cannot meet the needs of construction. After the transmission line is completed, it will be able to ensure the power supply needed for pouring the concrete dam at this construction site.
    This transmission line runs along steep mountains. Workers overcame many difficulties in erecting the line and installing equipment.

    制造人造丝浆的工厂
    据新华社讯　图门江畔的国营开山屯造纸厂最近开始改建一座人造丝浆工厂。
    用人造丝浆生产出的人造丝织成的绸子，格外鲜艳美观。由人造丝结成的鱼网也很结实耐用。一个用棉纱做帘子布的汽车轮胎，行走两万五千公里就脱胶不能用了，而用人造丝做帘子布的汽车轮胎，能走五万到十万公里。用人造丝浆还可以制造硝化纤维素作电影胶卷、汽车涂料等。
    这座工厂将在明年年底改建完成，可以年产两万吨人造丝浆。
    用破渔网做原料的工厂
    本报讯　利用破渔网作原料纺织漂亮绒毯的温州麻纺织厂，即将动工兴建。
    利用破渔网作纺织原料在我国还是一个创举。首先发现并把破渔网试制成功白色台毯和帆布的是温州福利麻纺织厂的一个普通工人李芝生。
    浙江、福建沿海的破网每年可收购一百五十万斤左右。能够充分满足这个厂的生产需要。过去，这些破渔网都被渔民烧饭烧掉，或者抛弃在海岛上烂掉了。（胡文焕）
    南平福州铁路开始铺轨
    新华社南平11日电　正在修建的南平——福州铁路10日从南平开始了第一期铺轨工程。
    南福铁路长一百七十三公里，是福建省第二条铁路，它经过南平到外洋支线和鹰厦铁路相衔接。目前，全线土石方工程已经完成50％，桥涵工程完成40％。
    云南有了颗粒肥料厂
    新华社昆明11日电　云南省第一座颗粒肥料厂最近在昆明建成。这座工厂是在去年第四季度开始动工修建的。在建厂工程进行当中，生产部门同时也进行了产品试制工作。到现在为止，已经生产了八十吨肥料。
    以往云南所用的化学肥料，要从上海、广州等地用汽车运来，因此价格较高，数量也少。这个厂投入生产以后，每年可以生产两千多吨颗粒肥料。不久，昆明附近的农村就能用上价廉的颗粒肥料。
    淮河上的输电线路
    新华社蚌埠11日电　淮河上从佛子岭水电站到磨子潭水库工地全长十七公里的高压输电线已经建成，并且在8日晚上开始送电。
    磨子潭水库位在安徽省霍山县淮河上最大的支流——淠河东源，是淮河上今年新开工的工程。水库工地因为现有的发电设备很少，电力不能满足施工的需要，输电线建成以后，就能够保证供应这个工地浇筑混凝土坝所需要的电力。
    这条输电线沿线是陡削的崇山峻岭，工人们在架设线路和安装设备过程中克服了很多困难。
