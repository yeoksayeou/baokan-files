Farmers in Rongchang County, Sichuan Province, have sold a particularly large quantity of pig bristles and feathers to the state this year. As of the end of November, the procurement stations in the county had purchased pig bristles and feathers far exceeding the annual procurement plan.

The white pig bristles of Rongchang County are very famous in the world. In the international market, four-inch long bristles are already considered quite good, while some of the white pig bristles in Rongchang County are as long as six inches. Therefore, the farmers in this county attach particular importance to pig breeding. (Picture attached)

The farmers in Rongchang County also have a high enthusiasm for raising geese. For each goose raised, the money from selling goose feathers alone (each goose has more than seven liang of feathers, and the purchase price is 8.8 jiao per jin) can be exchanged for more than three jin of salt. This year, the number of geese and ducks raised by farmers in the county has increased by more than seven times compared to last year.

    四川荣昌县农民卖给国家的猪鬃羽毛特别多
    本报讯　四川省荣昌县农民，今年卖给国家的猪鬃和羽毛特别多。到11月底为止，这个县的农产品采购站收购的猪鬃和羽毛，已经大大超过了全年的收购计划。其中，猪鬃全年收购计划为七千四百八十四斤，实际完成一万一千六百零八斤，超过计划55.1％；羽毛收购计划为一万五千七百斤，实际完成二万五千三百八十三斤，超过计划61.6％。光是超额部分，就可以从国外换回六部多拖拉机。
    荣昌县的白猪鬃，在世界上很出名。国际市场上，四英寸长的猪鬃，已经是相当好的了，而荣昌县的白猪鬃，有的长达六英寸。因此，这个县的农民，特别重视养猪生产。（附图片）
    荣昌县的农民，养鹅的情绪也很高。农民每养一只鹅，光卖鹅毛的钱（每只鹅的羽毛有七两多，每斤收购价格为八角八分），就可以换到三斤多盐巴。今年，这个县农民养的鹅和鸭，比去年增加了七倍还多。　（刘宪文）
