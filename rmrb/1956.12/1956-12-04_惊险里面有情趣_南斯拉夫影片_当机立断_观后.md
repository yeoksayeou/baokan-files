　　Thrills with Sentiment
　　-- After Watching the Yugoslav Film "A Decisive Moment"

    I have seen some thrillers in the past, and they impressed me as having tightly interwoven plots and an aggressive momentum, keeping you on edge from beginning to end, making it hard to breathe; but after watching the Yugoslav film "A Decisive Moment", I felt that thrillers should also have something else in them.
    "A Decisive Moment" has some thrilling elements in both content and form. The entire plot development has occasional unexpected twists and turns, making it unpredictable; the tense atmosphere presented in many scenes does indeed make people feel uneasy. But in addition to this, it also inserts a lot of very humorous descriptions full of life's interest; and these descriptions are closely related to the theme of the film and closely match the identities of the characters in the play. In this way, the film has a clear sense of rhythm, and the inner activities of the characters are shown in many ways; and the film does not just play the role of telling people a thrilling story, but becomes a real work of art.
    From the film, we first learn that a famous medical professor has accepted a critically injured patient. This is a leader of the underground movement who has fallen into the hands of the enemy, and the professor is considering how to save him from death and the clutches of the enemy. We see the professor operating, his forehead covered in sweat, the doctors and nurses surrounding him holding their breath, and the blood pressure measuring instruments and blood transfusion equipment showing the critical condition of the injured person. A tense atmosphere permeated everywhere, and the audience felt a knot in their hearts: could the injured person be saved? Could he escape the clutches of the enemy?
    At the same time, the audience also saw another scene developing simultaneously with these plots. Nurse Maria is injecting "serum" (actually sleeping pills) into the enemy officers and soldiers escorting the prisoners. The officers and soldiers teased each other and said some boring things. However, from these words, we saw their despicable souls: they just wanted to get by and take the opportunity to have fun, while also worrying about their uncertain fate. We had nothing but contempt for them. These plots, on the surface, seem to ease the tension of the plot development, giving the audience a chance to rest, but in essence, they bring the play to a new climax. Because only after these confused guys are put to sleep with sleeping pills can the patriots take the opportunity to help the underground movement leader escape.
    The professor and the underground worker Francis and others disguised themselves as mourners and escorted the underground movement leader out of the city in a coffin. They carried the coffin into the dense forest. At this moment, several enemy soldiers appeared. They recognized that the carriage outside the forest belonged to Francis, so they called out Francis's name and asked what he was doing. How would Francis answer? It was impossible to fight head-on, the audience worried. But Francis, pulling up his pants and with an embarrassed expression, calmly came out of the woods. Isn't it normal for people living in the countryside to relieve themselves in the woods? No wonder the enemy joked with him and left without any doubt.
    Many similar ingenious episodes are everywhere in the film. And therefore, the heroic and witty image of the patriots is more prominent, and the enemy also appears more incompetent, brutal, and昏庸.

　　惊险里面有情趣
　　——南斯拉夫影片“当机立断”观后
　　何坪
    过去看过一些惊险片，它们给我的印象只是：情节环环紧扣，气势咄咄逼人，从头到尾，紧张得叫人喘不过气来；但在看了南斯拉夫影片“当机立断”以后，却觉得惊险片里面也应该有一些别的东西。
    “当机立断”这部影片从内容到形式都带有若干惊险成分。整个剧情发展中时有奇峰突起，使人捉摸不定；许多场面呈现出的紧张气氛也的确使人心里惴惴不安。可是除此以外，它也插入了很多非常诙谐的、富有生活情趣的描写；而且这些描写是和影片的主题紧紧相连，是和剧中人物的身分密切吻合的。这样一来，就使得影片具有鲜明的节奏感，使得人物的内心活动得到了多方面的展现；而影片也就不只是起了向人们讲一个惊心动魄的故事的作用，却成为真正的艺术作品了。
    从影片里面，我们首先知道的是：一位著名的医学教授接受了一个伤势垂危的病人。这是一个已经落到敌人手里了的地下运动领导人，教授正在考虑如何把他从死亡和敌人的魔掌里拯救出来。我们看到的是额上满是汗珠的正在动手术的教授，屏声静气地环侍在他周围的医生和护士，以及显示受伤者病情危急的量血压的仪器和输血的器械等等。紧张的气氛四处弥漫着，观众心里打了一个疙瘩：受伤者能不能救治？能不能逃出敌人的魔掌呢？
    与此同时，观众又看到了和这些情节同时发展着的另一场戏。护士玛利亚正在为押送犯人来的敌军官兵注射“血清”（实际上是安眠针）。官兵们互相嘲弄着，说些无聊话。然而从这些话中，我们却看到了他们卑劣的灵魂：他们只想得过且过地趁机作乐，同时也为自己朝不保夕的命运耽忧。对于他们除了鄙夷之情外，再也没有别的了。这些情节，表面看来，似乎缓和了剧情发展的紧张局面，使得观众得到了暂歇的机会，实质上却把戏带向了一个新的高潮。因为打过安眠针，使得这些糊涂的家伙进入梦乡以后，爱国者们才能趁机帮助地下运动领导人逃脱。
    教授和地下工作者弗兰西斯等人化装成送丧的人，把装在棺材里的地下运动领导人护送出城了。他们把棺材抬到密林里去。正在这时候，几个敌军出现了，他们认出了林子外面的马车是弗兰西斯的，便高叫起弗兰西斯的名字来，问他在干什么。弗兰西斯怎么回答呢？硬拼是不行的呀？观众这样耽心着。但是弗兰西斯却提着裤子，带着尴尬的表情，从容不迫地从树林里出来了。住在乡里的人在树林里大小便，不是平常的事吗？难怪敌人和他开了一句玩笑就深信不疑地走了。
    类似的许多巧妙的插曲，在影片里在在皆是。而因此，爱国者英勇、机智的形象更加突出，敌人也显得更加无能、残暴和昏庸了。
