    Hebei Province, Zhuoxian County Converts Many Low-lying Areas into Good Paddy Fields
    Many Grain-deficient Villages Become Grain-Surplus Villages

    (Our Newspaper) News: Zhuoxian County, Hebei Province, has fifteen large low-lying areas that have suffered from floods for years, gradually deteriorating the soil quality. Except for occasional dry years, there is little harvest. The lives of the local people are very difficult. Starting in 1953, the local Party and government organs led the farmers in transforming the low-lying areas. They built embankments, raised soil, and leveled the land in the low-lying areas, turning the land into a ridged shape, and then diverted water for irrigation, changing from planting dry crops to planting rice. Transforming low-lying areas required 30 to 40 workdays per mu, and the difficulty of labor was not easy to solve during the individual economy and the period of running small-scale primary cooperatives. After the realization of advanced cooperativization last winter, this difficulty was overcome. From last winter to this spring, due to unified planning and rational organization of labor, in just a few months, 17,300 mu of unproductive low-lying land was transformed into very good paddy fields. In the case of this year's severe flood, the average yield was 247 jin per mu, and the good ones yielded 600 jin per mu, turning the original disaster-stricken villages into lightly affected villages, many grain-deficient cooperatives into self-sufficient cooperatives, and many self-sufficient cooperatives into surplus cooperatives. Zhaozhuang Village in Hutongkou Township has a total of 84 households. In 1955, the whole village lacked 78,000 jin of grain. After converting all the low-lying land into good fields in 1955, the grain harvested this year, in addition to being enough for the village to eat, was also transferred to other villages with 50,000 jin.
    Now, the enthusiasm of the masses is very high, and they are demanding a larger-scale transformation of low-lying areas. The county plans to transform another 30,500 mu of low-lying land; the remaining 47,000 mu of low-lying land, due to the limitations of soil quality, water conservancy and other conditions, are prepared to mobilize the masses to change to planting water-tolerant and flood-resistant crops.

### 河北涿县把许多低洼地改造成好稻田  许多缺粮村变成了余粮村

    河北涿县把许多低洼地改造成好稻田
    许多缺粮村变成了余粮村
    本报讯　河北省涿县有十五块较大的低洼地区，由于连年遭受水灾，土质逐渐变坏，除个别旱年外，很少有收成。当地群众的生活非常艰苦。从1953年开始，当地党政机关领导农民进行了改造低洼地区的工作，在洼地上打埂、起土、垫平，使土地变成畦状，然后引水灌溉，由种旱作物改种水稻。改造低洼地，每亩需要三十到四十个工，在个体经济和办小型初级社的时期，劳动力的困难不好解决。去年冬天，高级合作化实现以后，这个困难就克服了。去冬今春期间，由于进行了统一规划，合理组织了劳力，短短几个月内，将一万七千三百亩不生长庄稼的洼地改造成了很好的稻田。在今年遭受严重水灾的情况下，平均每亩产了二百四十七斤，好的每亩产六百斤，使原来的重灾村变成了轻灾村，许多缺粮社变成了自足社，许多自足社变成了余粮社。胡同口乡的赵庄村共八十四户，1955年全村缺粮七万八千斤，1955年将所有的低洼地改成良田后，今年收的粮除够本村吃外，还调到其他村五万斤。
    现在，群众的情绪很高涨，要求进行更大规模的洼地改造工作。全县计划再改造三万零五百亩洼地；其余的四万七千亩低洼地，因土质、水利等条件的限制，准备发动群众改种成避水耐涝作物。（刘晋才）
