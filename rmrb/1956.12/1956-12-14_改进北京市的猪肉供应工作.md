    Improving Beijing's Pork Supply
    Huang Zhi
    These days, Beijing citizens are queuing to buy pork in an orderly manner, just as they have in the past. However, they feel that buying pork is becoming increasingly difficult. Anyone who wants to buy a little pork has to brave the biting cold and queue up at four or five in the morning, but even then, they are not guaranteed to be able to buy any. The masses are very dissatisfied with this situation.
    The main reason for the tight pork supply is the reduced source of live pigs. Not long ago, comrades from the Beijing Food Company responsible for the live pig business told me that in the past, their live pig inventory could supply ten days of sales needs, but now the inventory of two thousand six hundred pigs is only enough for two days. Since August, except for holidays, the pork supply in Beijing has been continuously reduced. In July, 2,200 live pigs were slaughtered every Sunday, and 1,800 to 2,000 on weekdays; by the beginning of November, the daily slaughter had dropped to 1,200.
    How much pork can Beijing citizens actually eat each month? Is it too little? Is it possible to eat a little more under the current circumstances? These questions are of concern to the citizens of Beijing, and also of concern to the leaders of Beijing.
    The current distribution of these 1,200 pigs is as follows: a portion is directly supplied to various levels of government agencies, organizations, and the military in Beijing, totaling more than 470 pigs; a small portion is supplied to foreign embassies and Beijing's processing plants (processed into sausages, preserved meat, etc. for sale), as well as to restaurants such as "Shaguoju" and "Duyichu" that make specially flavored dishes; another portion, about 480 pigs, is sold on the market, supplying residents and restaurants in Beijing's urban and suburban areas.
    From the actual situation of buying pork on the market, I have discovered the following problems:
    First, the amount of pork needed by restaurants is quite large. According to statistics from Beijing's commercial departments, they need about 260 pigs a day, accounting for half of the amount sold on the market. The Beijing Supervision Bureau's investigation in front of the gate on a Sunday also confirmed this: 50% of the pork sold by the front gate food store No. 1 was bought by restaurants. Taking the "Duyichu" restaurant, famous for making shaomai, as an example, this restaurant was originally a planned supply target, but it often buys meat on the market. One day, it bought more than 300 jin on the market.
    The pork purchased by Beijing's joint state-private industrial and commercial households, handicraft production cooperatives, and catering units with less than ten people has not yet been included.
    Second, since August, after Beijing reduced the amount of pork supplied to government agencies and organizations, some procurement personnel from these agencies have violated regulations and squeezed with citizens to buy pork. Under the circumstances that the purchase quantity is strictly limited, they adopt the method of queuing separately and buying from multiple places; and in some cases, they can buy dozens of jin at a time. I saw such materials in the Dongsi District Non-staple Food Office. On October 7, the procurement personnel of Beijing Second Construction Company ran to the Beixinqiao Food Company's second meat retail store and lied that they had not compiled a plan, buying more than 150 jin of pork at once. On October 14, the Beijing Clothing Factory bought 100 jin of pork at the Dongdan District's first meat retail store. This is not an isolated case. According to the manager of the "Wanfulou" meat shop in front of the gate, many government agencies and organizations come to their shop to buy meat, and the amount they buy is not small.
    Third, in the case of insufficient supply of fresh pork, it is not difficult to buy soy-stewed pork and sausages in Beijing, but the price is more than twice as expensive as fresh pork. Precisely because the gross profit from processing soy-stewed meat is nearly double that of selling fresh pork, many joint state-private shops and consignment shops selling pork have started processing the pork that should be sold to citizens. Someone learned from Xidan District that 27 joint state-private shops and consignment shops are engaged in processing. The joint venture store "Baoshengxiang" in this district rarely processed cooked meat before, but now it has to deduct hundreds of jin of good pork every day for processing, and the amount of cooked meat processed accounts for about one-third of the daily sales volume.
    From the above facts, the pork supplied on the market every day is very limited for citizens to buy. Roughly calculated, each person can only buy about four liang per month.
    Perhaps some people will say, "There is no way to avoid this, the basic situation now is that the source of pigs is insufficient."
    There is some truth to this view, but at the same time, I believe that even under the current circumstances, it is still possible for citizens to eat a little more pork.
    Now let's take a look at the pork supply situation for government agencies and organizations:
    As mentioned earlier, the amount of pork supplied to government agencies, organizations, and the military in Beijing has been gradually compressed since August. Before August, the supply was based on the meat consumption plan drawn up by the government agencies and organizations themselves. Now, the supply is based on 30% of the planned amount (50% for the military), that is, if the plan is for 100 jin, only 30 jin are given. Compared with the supply volume before July, it has been greatly reduced. On average, each government cadre can still eat more than one jin per month (the situation of government agencies is also different, and many government agencies and units do not need this amount of pork). This is three times more than what citizens eat each month. Of course, the living and working conditions of government agencies and the military are very different from those of the masses, and it is reasonable to supply a little more meat. However, in the case of a very tight pork supply and many complaints from the citizens, the working cadres of various government agencies and organizations in Beijing can completely eat less meat, so that the citizens can eat more.
    In the past few days, Beijing's commercial departments have also been actively arranging the pork supply, preparing to further compress the supply to government agencies and organizations, and at the same time, increase the supply to citizens. The needs of restaurants will also be arranged separately, and they will no longer be supplied together with the citizens on the market. This method has greatly improved the distribution situation and made the supply more reasonable. I hope this method can be implemented as soon as possible. However, more importantly, it should be made clear to the working cadres and military personnel of various government agencies and organizations in Beijing the actual situation of the citizens' supply, and that it is entirely right to let the citizens buy more pork, and to promote the spirit of sharing weal and woe with the masses.

### 改进北京市的猪肉供应工作

    改进北京市的猪肉供应工作
    黄植
    这些日子，北京市民正同过去一样，有秩序地排队购买猪肉。但是，他们感到购买猪肉越来越困难了。谁要想买到一点猪肉，他就不得不冒着刺骨的冷风在早晨四、五点钟去排队，但排在队里也不一定都能买到。群众对这些现象很不满意。
    猪肉供应紧张的原因，主要是生猪来源少了。不久以前，北京市食品公司搞生猪业务的同志向我谈及这问题的时候说，过去，他们的生猪库存可以供十天的销售需要，而现在库存的二千六百头猪，仅仅够两天用。自从8月以来，除了节日以外，北京市猪肉供应量不断减少。7月间，每个星期日宰杀生猪二千二百头，平时是一千八百头到两千头；至11月初，每天宰杀的已经降低到一千二百头了。
    现在，北京市民到底每月吃得到多少猪肉呢？是不是吃得太少了？有没有可能在现在的情况下多吃到一点？这些问题是北京市民关心的，同时也是北京市领导方面所关心的。
    目前这一千二百头猪的分配情况是：一部分直接供应给北京市内各级机关团体、部队，数量是四百七十多头；一小部分是供应外国使馆和北京的加工厂（加工成香肠、酱肉等出售），以及供应“沙锅居”、“都一处”等制作有特殊风味的饮食店；再一部分，约四百八十多头是在市上销售，供应北京城区和郊区居民和饮食店。
    我从市场上购买猪肉的实际情况中发现这样一些问题：
    第一，饮食店需要的猪肉数量相当大。据北京市商业部门统计，每天约需二百六十头上下，占市上销售数量的一半。最近北京市监察局在一个星期日派人在前门了解到的情况也证实这点：前门食品第一商店销售的猪肉有50％都为饮食店买去。以做烧麦著名的饮食店“都一处”为例，这个店原是计划供应的对象，但也常常在市上买肉，有一天就在市上买去三百多斤。
    至于北京市公私合营的工商业户、手工业生产社、十人以下的伙食单位等购买的猪肉尚未计入。
    第二，自从8月份起，北京市对机关团体猪肉供应数量减少以后，部分机关采购员便违反规定，同市民一起挤购猪肉。他们在购买数量有严格限定的情况下，采取分别排队，多处购买的办法；而在某些场合，他们便可一次购买几十斤。我在东四区副食办公室就看到这样的材料，10月7日北京市第二建筑公司的采购员跑到北新桥食品公司第二肉品零售店，谎说没有编造计划，一次买去猪肉一百五十多斤。10月14日北京市被服厂在东单区第一肉品零售商店一次买去猪肉一百斤。这并不是个别情况，据前门“万福楼”肉店经理反映，机关团体上他们店里买肉的很多，而且购买的数字都不小。
    第三，在鲜猪肉供应不足的情况下，在北京购买酱猪肉、香肠之类并不困难，只是价格比鲜猪肉贵一倍以上。正因为加工酱肉比售卖生猪肉的毛利高近一倍，于是不少出售猪肉的公私合营店和代销店，便把应该出售给市民的猪肉搞起加工来了。有人从西单区了解到，有二十七户公私合营店和代销店都在搞加工。这个区的合营店“宝圣祥”以前很少加工熟肉，现在每天要扣下百十斤好猪肉来加工，加工熟肉的数字约占每日销售量的三分之一。
    从以上事实看来，每日市上供应的猪肉，市民能买到的很有限，粗略计算，每人每月不过四两上下。
    也许有人会说，“这是没有办法的事呀，现在的基本情况是猪源不足”。
    这种看法有一部分道理，但同时，我认为就在目前情况下，让市民多吃一点猪肉的可能性还是有的。
    现在就让我们来看看机关、团体的猪肉供应情况吧：
    前面说过，北京市机关、团体、部队的猪肉供应量，从8月份以来在逐步压缩。8月份以前是按机关团体自己订的用肉计划供应，现在是按计划量供应30％（部队是50％），即计划一百斤，只给三十斤了。比较7月份以前的供应量已大大减少。平均起来每个机关干部每月还可以吃到一斤以上（机关的情况也很不同，不少机关、单位需要的猪肉也不到这个数量）。这比市民每月吃的多了三倍。当然，机关、部队的生活条件和工作条件同市民群众比较有很多不同之处，肉食供应稍多一些也是合理的。但是，在猪肉供应十分紧张，市民群众意见很多的情况下，北京各机关团体的工作人员，完全可以再少吃一些肉，使市民能多吃到一些。
    最近几天，北京市商业部门也积极在安排猪肉的供应，准备把机关、团体的供应量再加压缩，同时，增加对市民的供应量。饮食店的需要也另行安排，不再在市场上同市民一起供应。这办法在很大程度上改进了分配状况，使供应趋于合理。我希望这个办法能及早实行。但是，更重要的是应当使北京各机关团体的工作干部和部队人员了解到市民供应的实际情况，了解到让市民多买到一些猪肉是完全应该的，发扬与群众同甘共苦的精神。
