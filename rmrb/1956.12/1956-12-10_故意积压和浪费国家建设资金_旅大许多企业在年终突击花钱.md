Deliberately Hoarding and Wasting National Construction Funds
　　Many Enterprises in Lüda Rush to Spend Money at the End of the Year
　　Our Newspaper, Dalian, December 8th – In order to obtain national investment, many factories and enterprises in Lüda City are using improper methods to rush spending at the end of the year. This year, some units have added a lot of welfare construction investment regardless of actual possibilities. However, due to insufficient building materials and construction manpower, most of these projects cannot be started this year. According to the State Council's notice, these investments should be stopped. However, some units feel that if these investments are not spent quickly, there will be no money for them next year. Therefore, they have come up with many ways to rush the money out. The first method is to sign agreements with the Lüda City Real Estate Bureau to purchase "assumed property rights" by paying in advance. This year, in order to solve the problem of employee dormitories in the Ganjingzi District, the Real Estate Bureau built some houses in Jinjia Street. However, the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory, which is more than 20 miles away from Jinjia Street, wants to buy these houses. An agreement has now been reached: the locomotive factory will allocate all of this year’s investment for the construction of 3,050 square meters of dormitories (200,000 yuan) to the Real Estate Bureau within fifteen days, and the Real Estate Bureau will allocate the property rights of three buildings to the locomotive factory as the completion of the locomotive factory’s investment plan this year. In reality, the locomotive factory is more than 20 miles away from Jinjia Street and cannot use these dormitories, so there is only an "assumed property right." The property rights will be exchanged after the Real Estate Bureau builds dormitories near the locomotive factory next year. Currently, three units have done this, and three other units are planning to do so. The second approach is to start construction regardless of whether the conditions are met. Some units have even mobilized some workers and staff from non-construction departments to dig the foundations. More than ten units, including the Electric Porcelain Factory, have adopted this method. The third method is to take back the factory director's fund that has already been spent and replace it with national investment. The Dalian Paint Factory used the factory director's fund to build a new club this year, which was completed in November. However, the employee dormitory with an additional investment of more than 80,000 yuan in the fourth quarter has not yet started. They think that the factory director's fund can be freely disposed of in the future, while the national investment that is taken back is difficult to recover. Therefore, they took back the factory director's fund and claimed that the money used to build the club was national investment.
    These practices of rushing to spend money have created a false phenomenon of completing the investment plan, and have accumulated and wasted national construction funds. Therefore, the Lüda Branch of the People's Construction Bank of China has explained and stopped some unreasonable appropriations, and has reported the above situation to the relevant departments in a timely manner, suggesting that this behavior be stopped.

    故意积压和浪费国家建设资金
　　旅大许多企业在年终突击花钱
    本报大连8日电　旅大市许多工厂企业为了获取国家投资，在年末利用不正当的办法突击花钱。今年有些单位不顾实际可能，追加了许多福利建设投资。但是因为建筑材料和施工力量不足，这些工程在今年大都不能开工。根据国务院的通知，这些投资应该停止使用。但是，有些单位感到这些投资如果不赶快花掉，明年就没有这笔钱了。因此想出不少办法来把这些钱突击花出去。其中第一种办法是向旅大市房地产局签订协议，以先付款的办法购买“假定产权”。今年房地产局为了解决甘井子区一带的职工宿舍问题，特在金家街盖了一部分房屋。但是离金家街二十多里的大连机车车辆制造工厂，却要购买这些房屋。现已达成协议：机车厂在十五天内，把今年建筑三千零五十平方公尺宿舍的投资（二十万元）全部拨给房地产局，而房地产局则把三幢楼房的产权拨给机车厂，作为完成机车厂今年的投资计划。实际上机车厂距金家街二十多里，不能使用这些宿舍，因此只有一种“假定产权”，等明年房地产局在机车厂附近盖了宿舍以后，再来兑换产权。现在像这样做的已有三个单位，还有三个单位也打算这样做。第二种做法是不管有没有条件，先破土动工再说。有的单位甚至动员了非建筑部门的一些工人和职员去挖地基。采用这种办法的有电瓷厂等十多个单位。第三种办法是把已花出去的厂长基金收回来，用国家投资去顶替。大连油漆厂今年用厂长基金新建了一幢俱乐部，已于11月完工。但是第四季度追加八万多元投资的职工宿舍却没有动工。他们想，厂长基金以后可以自由支配，而收回去的国家投资则很难要回来，于是他们就把厂长基金收回来，而把盖俱乐部用的钱说成是国家投资。
    这些突击花钱的做法，造成了完成投资计划的虚假现象，积压和浪费了国家建设资金。因此，中国人民建设银行旅大分行对于某些不合理的拨款，已经加以解释和阻止，并且将上述情况及时报告有关部门，建议制止这种行为。（先智）
