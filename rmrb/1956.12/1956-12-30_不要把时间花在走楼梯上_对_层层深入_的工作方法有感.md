	Don't Waste Time Climbing Stairs
	—Thoughts on the "Layer-by-Layer" Work Method
	Tian Yuan
	Recently, I read a report from the Shandong Branch of the People's Bank of China on inspecting peak season work. In this report, they summarized the following experience: because peak season work is characterized by concentrated tasks and strong time sensitivity, when going deep into the grassroots, one can bypass the special zone and go directly to the county, or one can first go to the grassroots and then understand the situation level by level from the bottom up, without having to go down layer by layer like climbing stairs, and then come up layer by layer. This experience has greatly enlightened me, reminding me of my previous experiences of going deep into the grassroots to inspect and investigate work.
	In the winter of the year before last, I accompanied the inspection team of the head office of the People's Bank of China to Henan to inspect peak season banking work. This inspection particularly emphasized going deep into the grassroots. However, after arriving at the provincial branch, a week was spent listening to reports, studying the situation, and contacting relevant departments. After arriving at the central branch of the special zone and the county branch, another full week was spent listening to reports, plus studying the situation and contacting relevant departments, totaling more than ten days. After going deep into the grassroots units of the bank in rural areas – business offices and credit cooperatives – only four days were left to understand three credit cooperatives and two business offices. Moreover, excluding the time spent on the road, the actual working time in each grassroots unit was only a few hours, so of course the understanding was not very thorough. After the grassroots understanding was completed, as usual, the situation was reported to the county branch, the central branch of the special zone, and the provincial branch, and opinions were exchanged, which took almost half a month. This made me feel that we spent too much time going deep into the grassroots on the "stairs" of going down layer by layer and then coming up layer by layer.
	Recently, I accompanied the investigation team of the head office of the People's Bank of China on a month-long investigation of rural currency circulation in Shanxi. After the working group arrived in Shanxi, twelve days were spent listening to reports from the provincial, special zone, and county-level People's Banks, and exchanging opinions with relevant departments. After going deep into the rural areas, because of excessive attention to collecting statistical materials and general information, another seven days were spent listening to introductions from township cadres and cooperative cadres, and collecting relevant production and distribution materials from townships and cooperatives. By the time we were ready to investigate the main subjects of this investigation – the farmers – twenty-one days of the one-month deadline had passed. Later, we were rushed back by a telegram from the head office, so the working group only investigated the farmers for three days before the investigation ended. After the grassroots investigation was completed, because of the urgency to return to Beijing, the investigation materials were only exchanged with agricultural cooperatives for two hours, the county branch was reported to for three hours, the central branch was talked to at the train station for forty minutes, and the provincial branch was reported to and briefly talked to for half a day. Therefore, the investigation materials were not repeatedly checked, corrected, and studied as necessary. This investigation made me feel even more deeply that the reason why we cannot go deep into the grassroots is that the shortcomings in our work methods are that we spend too much time at the upper levels and too little time working at the grassroots; the process of going deep into the grassroots is too long, and the process of returning to the leading organs is too short. The result is inevitably that we hear more general reports and study fewer concrete materials. A comrade from a lower-level bank said to our working group that went down to understand the situation: "You have too many circulation links." This is a very correct view.
	Of course, this does not mean that layer-by-layer in-depth investigation is a wrong work method. I am just saying that leading organs should adopt flexible work methods, like the Shandong Provincial People's Bank, according to different purposes and requirements. They can adopt layer-by-layer understanding from top to bottom, or they can first go deep into the grassroots and then study layer by layer from the bottom up. They can adopt a method of going straight to the bottom, or they can adopt a method of bypassing levels. They must never be bound by a fixed formula.
	At the same time, according to my superficial experience of going deep into the grassroots several times, the closer one is to the grassroots, the more concrete, real, and vivid the materials collected and the problems discovered, and the stronger the persuasiveness. Taking our recent trip to rural Shanxi as an example, although our time at the grassroots was short, we obtained the most materials. Of course, this does not mean that leading organs do not need to collect indirect materials, but that leading organs should be more oriented towards the grassroots, towards reality, and towards the masses. At the same time, some indirect materials are often distorted beyond recognition or become incongruous because they have been passed down layer by layer through writing and speech, processed and organized. This cannot be ignored. If the leading organs do not conscientiously go deep into the grassroots, then it is not easy to distinguish between wrong and correct materials, useless and useful materials, and there is a danger of committing bureaucracy and subjectivism.
	In short, the leading organs should flexibly and correctly use the work method of going deep into the grassroots, and combine improving the work style with improving the work methods.

    不要把时间花在走楼梯上
    ——对“层层深入”的工作方法有感
    田园
    最近，我看了一份中国人民银行山东省分行检查旺季工作的报告。在这个报告里，他们总结了这样一条经验：由于旺季工作具有任务集中、时间性强的特点，因此深入基层时可以越过专区直接到县，也可以先到基层然后由下而上地逐级了解，不必一定要像走楼梯一样一层一层下去，又一层一层上来。这条经验给我很大的启发，使我想起自己以往几次深入基层检查和调查工作的情况。
    前年的冬天，我曾随人民银行总行的检查组到河南检查过一次旺季银行工作。这次的检查，特别强调要深入到基层中去。但到达省分行后，由于听取汇报、研究情况，和有关部门进行联系，就花了一个星期时间；到专区中心支行和县支行后，又听了整整一个星期的汇报，再加上研究情况及与有关部门进行联系，一共用了十多天的时间。深入到银行在农村的基层单位——营业所和信用社后，只剩四天的时间去了解三个信用社和两个营业所。而且除去路上所花时间外，在每个基层单位的实际工作时间仅仅几个小时，当然了解的情况很不深入。基层了解结束以后，又是照例地向县支行、专区中心支行、省分行汇报情况，交换意见，用了差不多半个月的时间。由此我不禁感到：我们在深入基层中消耗在这层层下去、又层层上来的楼梯上的时间太多了。
    最近，我又随人民银行总行的调查组，在山西进行了一个来月的农村货币流通情况的调查。工作组到达山西后，由于听取省、专、县各级人民银行的汇报，及向有关部门，交换意见，就花费了十二天的时间。深入到农村以后，又因过分注意了搜集数字材料和一般情况，因此听取乡干部、社干部介绍情况，统计乡、社的有关生产分配材料，又用了七天时间。等到向这次的主要调查对象——农民进行调查时，限期一个月的调查已经过去二十一天了，后来又赶上总行电报催返，因此工作组仅仅向农民调查了三天便告结束。基层调查结束后，由于返京急迫，调查的材料仅和农业社交换了两个钟头的意见，向县支行进行了三个钟头的汇报，和中心支行在车站上交谈了四十分钟，和省分行进行了半天的汇报和简短的交谈，因此调查材料未经过反复的查对、订正和必要的研究。这次调查使我更深切地感到我们所以不能深入基层，在工作方法上的缺点是上层逗留时间过长，在基层工作时间太短；深入基层时的过程过长，返回领导机关的过程太短；其结果必然是一般性的汇报听的多，具体材料研究少。一个下级行的同志向我们下去了解情况的工作组说：“你们的流通环节可太多了。”这是十分正确的看法。
    当然，这并不是说，层层深入是一种错误的工作方法。我只是说，领导机关在深入基层时应该根据不同的目的与要求，像山东省人民银行那样，采取灵活的工作方法，既可以采取由上而下的层层了解，也可以先深入基层，然后由下而上地层层研究；既可以采取一杆子通到底的办法，也可以采取越级的办法，绝不要被一种固定的公式箍住了。
    同时，根据我几次深入基层的肤浅体会，越距离基层近些，则所搜集到的材料和所发现的问题就越具体、越真切、越生动，说服力越强。就以我们这次深入山西农村为例，我们在基层的时间虽短，但所得的材料却最多。当然，这并不是说，领导机关不必搜集间接材料，而是说领导机关应该更多地面向基层，面向实际，面向群众。同时有些间接材料往往由于经过层层的笔传口诵，加工整理，而竟弄得面目全非，或不伦不类了，这是不能不注意的。如果领导机关不认真地深入基层，那么就不易区别错误的材料和正确的材料，无用的材料和有用的材料，就有犯官僚主义与主观主义的危险。
    总之领导机关应该灵活地、正确地运用深入基层的工作方法，并把改进工作作风和改进工作方法结合起来。
