	Distributing Farm By-products to Cooperative Members
	The Heilongjiang Daily published a commentary on December 7th entitled "Quickly Distribute Farm By-products to Cooperative Members." The commentary said: Farm by-products are an important source of feed for livestock. Especially this year, because some agricultural production cooperatives have inappropriately reduced the members' private plots, and potato production has decreased in most areas, and many agricultural cooperatives have not organized members to collect and store wild fodder, farm by-products are even more needed for the development of livestock breeding. Agricultural cooperatives in various places should quickly distribute farm by-products to cooperative members.
	Currently, in some agricultural cooperatives, many beet leaves that can be used as feed are discarded in the fields, and chaff and other native grains are left in the yards, exposed to wind and snow; on the other hand, many cooperative members are spending all day running around collecting feed. This is because many cooperatives have not paid attention to distributing by-products to members early.
	The commentary said: Distributing agricultural crop by-products to solve the feed problem for livestock and poultry of cooperative members is a major issue in developing household breeding, and the success of household breeding not only directly affects the amount of income of cooperative members, but also relates to the increase of farmland fertilizer and the supply of meat and egg products to urban and rural people; at the same time, fully utilizing agricultural crop by-products as feed can also save some feed grain. Therefore, this work should not be regarded as a trivial matter.
	In order to gradually develop the collective animal husbandry of agricultural cooperatives in a planned way, it is necessary to retain a certain amount of agricultural crop by-products as feed for the livestock of the agricultural cooperative's collective breeding industry. However, it is absolutely not permissible to freeze all agricultural crop by-products within the cooperative without distributing any to the members.

### 把农作物副产品分给社员

    把农作物副产品分给社员
    黑龙江日报12月7日以“快把农作物副产品分给社员”为题发表评论。评论说：农作物副产品是家畜的重要饲料来源。特别是今年有些农业生产合作社因为不适当地减少了社员的园田，大多数地区马铃薯减产，许多农业社没有组织社员采集和贮备野生饲料，农作物副产品对于发展家畜饲养业就更加需要了。各地农业社应该迅速地把农作物副产品分配给社员。
    目前，在有些农业社里有许多可以做饲料的甜菜叶子被丢弃在田地里，谷秕子和其它土粮食在场院里任凭风吹雪埋；另一方面又有许多社员终日为收集饲料而到处奔波。这是因为许多合作社没有注意及早把副产品分配给社员。
    评论说：分配农业作物副产品，给社员解决家畜、家禽饲料，是发展家庭饲养业的一个大问题，而家庭饲养业发展的好坏，不仅直接影响到社员收入的多寡，而且关系着农田肥料的增加，关系着城、乡人民肉蛋食品的供应；同时，把农作物副产品充当饲料充分利用起来，还可以节约一部分饲料粮食。因此，不应该把这项工作看作是小事情。
    为了有计划地逐步地发展农业社的集体畜牧业，留出一定数量的农作物副产品做为农业社集体饲养业的牲畜的饲料是必要的。但是决不可因此就把全部农作物副产品冻结在社内，丝毫不分给社员。
