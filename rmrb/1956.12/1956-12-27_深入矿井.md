Going Deep into the Mines

    After the leadership of the Xinqiu Mine of the Fuxin Coal Mine recently changed its leadership style, the production situation has improved significantly. Although the November production plan was increased by more than 15,000 tons compared to the previous monthly plan, it was still overfulfilled. In the first twenty-three days of December, the mine's output exceeded the plan by more than 1,000 tons. It is estimated that by the end of the year, in addition to making up for the more than 30,000 tons of raw coal underproduced in the first ten months, it will be possible to overproduce the annual plan by 8,000 tons of raw coal.

    In the past, the leaders of the Xinqiu Mine often only busied themselves with meetings, issuing notices, and requesting summaries. They rarely went down into the mine to understand the actual production situation and help solve problems. Even if they occasionally went down, they only took a cursory look. When deploying production tasks, the mine's leadership often only made arrangements in principle based on the completion of each pithead in the past. They rarely asked whether it could be completed or whether there were any problems in the process of execution. Therefore, in the past few years, the mine's production tasks have not been well completed. In the first ten months of this year, more than 30,000 tons of coal were underproduced, and the task was not completed in eight months.

    Recently, the leaders at all levels of the mine studied the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, examined and criticized this subjective and bureaucratic work style. When formulating the November plan, the leaders led the technical personnel to go down to the well to understand the working face, transportation and other conditions, and solicit the opinions of veteran workers. During the implementation of the plan, they also frequently checked, and immediately helped to find solutions when there were difficulties, solving many problems that could not be solved for a long time in the past. For example, in the 711 and 763 coal mining faces, there were many stones in the coal seam, and the efficiency of using the combined coal mining machine was very low. Although the workers repeatedly raised their opinions in the past, the mine leadership ignored the conditions and only subjectively emphasized the use of advanced machinery. Recently, the mine manager led the technical staff to carefully observe and study underground for two weeks, and decided to change to the method of drilling and blasting, and the production efficiency was significantly improved. In terms of promoting advanced experience, the past practice of brute force has also been changed, and according to the conditions of each working face, after research and pilot projects, it will be gradually promoted.

    Now, the workers' production enthusiasm in this mine has also greatly improved compared to the past due to the change in the leadership's style.

    深入矿井
    阜新煤矿新丘矿领导人员，最近改变领导作风以后，生产情况有了显著好转。11月份的产量计划虽然比过去月计划增加了一万五千多吨，可是仍然超额完成；12月份的前二十三天中，全矿产量又比计划超过了一千多吨。预计到年底，除补足前十个月欠产的三万多吨原煤以外，还可以超过全年计划多产八千吨原煤。
    新丘矿的领导人员过去常常只是忙于开会，发通知、要总结，很少下矿井去了解实际生产情况，帮助解决问题，即使偶尔下去一趟，也仅仅是走马观花地看一看。在布置生产任务的时候，矿里的领导方面往往只是根据各坑口以前完成的情况，原则上布置一下，至于是否能完成，执行过程中有没有问题，就很少过问。因此在过去几年里，这个矿生产任务始终完成得不好，今年前十个月中，欠产三万多吨煤，有八个月没有完成任务。
    最近，这个矿的各级领导人员学习了党的第八次全国代表大会的文件，检查和批判了这种主观主义和官僚主义的思想作风，在订11月份计划的时候，由领导人员带领技术人员，分别到井下去了解工作面、运输等条件，征求老工人的意见；在执行计划过程中，也经常检查，有困难马上帮助想办法，解决了许多过去长期无法解决的问题。例如在七一一和七六三采煤工作面，煤层中石头很多，使用联合采煤机效率很低，过去工人虽然一再提出意见，可是矿里领导方面不顾条件，只是主观主义地强调使用先进机械。最近矿长带领技术人员在井下经过两个星期的仔细观察和研究，确定改用打眼放炮方法，结果生产效率显著提高。在推广先进经验方面，也改变了过去蛮干的作法，而且根据各个工作面的条件，经过研究、试点以后，再逐步推广。
    现在，这个矿工人的生产情绪，也由于领导人员作风的改变，比过去大大提高了。
