Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, December 1st: At the Fuxin Xinqiu Mine, ten young couples who have been separated for a long time due to lack of housing will soon be moving into houses recently vacated by the mine's leading cadres.

In the past, the party and administrative leading cadres of this mine occupied a relatively large number of houses, while the phenomenon of workers lacking housing was very serious. Recently, when studying the documents of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the party organization of this mine criticized the past neglect of workers' lives and the lack of a spirit of hard work, plain living, and sharing weal and woe with the masses among some leading cadres.

Now, in addition to the leading cadres vacating some of the houses they occupied for the workers, the mine's party, administration, and trade union are also trying to solve the workers' urgent needs for housing, clubs, nurseries, bathhouses, etc., within the possible conditions. Prior to this, the mine also adjusted the offices, with section chiefs and ministers of party and trade union organizations working together with general cadres. After this adjustment, seven more worker families obtained the houses they urgently needed.

    发扬艰苦朴素的作风　同职工群众共甘苦
　　新丘矿领导干部腾房子给职工住
    新华社阜新1日电　阜新新丘矿有十对因为没有住处而长期分居的青年夫妇，就要搬到矿里领导干部新腾出的房子里去住了。
    过去，这个矿的党和行政的领导干部占用的住房比较多，职工缺少住房的现象却非常严重。最近，这个矿的党组织，在学习中共八届二中全会文件的时候，批判了过去对职工的生活很少关心，以及有些领导干部缺乏艰苦朴素与群众共甘苦的作风。
    现在，除了领导干部把占用的住房腾出一部分让给职工以外，这个矿的党、行政和工会还设法在可能的条件下，解决职工急需的住房、俱乐部、托儿所、澡堂等。在这以前，这个矿还调整了办公室，科长和党与工会组织的部长同一般干部都到一起办公，这样调整以后，又使七户职工得到了他们急需的房子。
