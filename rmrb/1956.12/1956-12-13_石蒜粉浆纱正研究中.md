	Amaryllis Bulb Powder for Sizing Yarn Under Study

	After your newspaper published an article on page 2 on October 26th about some handicraft weaving factories in Tianjin using amaryllis bulb powder instead of flour for sizing yarn, we received many letters from readers requesting information on this method and asking for its promotion.

	After studying this matter, our ministry believes that amaryllis is a poisonous wild plant containing alkaloids that can irritate human skin. Long-term use may affect human health. We have asked the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences to conduct animal experiments to study its toxicity. Therefore, before we have any conclusions, we believe it is not appropriate to introduce or promote it.

    石蒜粉浆纱正研究中
    你报自10月26日在二版发表了天津市部分手工业织布厂采用石蒜粉代替面粉浆纱以后，曾收到不少读者来信，要求介绍此种方法并加以推广。
    经我部研究后认为：石蒜系一种有毒的野生植物，含有生物碱，对人体皮肤有刺激作用，若长期使用可能影响人体健康。目前正请医学科学院进行动物试验，研究它的毒害问题。因此，在未得到结论前，我们认为不宜介绍推广。
