    Give Play to the Collective Strength of Agricultural Cooperatives; Promote Large-Scale Technological Innovation
    Zhejiang Province Increases Grain Production by More Than 300 Million Jin This Year
    Disaster Situation Is the Most Severe in Decades, but Grain Production Increase Is Unprecedentedly High
    (Our Newspaper News) Zhejiang Province achieved an unprecedented increase in grain production this year despite being hit by several severe natural disasters. It is estimated that the total grain output of the province this year can reach about 15 billion jin, an increase of more than 320 million jin compared with the favorable year of 1955, and an increase of more than 1.1 billion jin compared with 1932, the year with the highest grain output in the province before liberation.
    Zhejiang Province suffered from the most severe natural disasters in decades this year. During August and September, strong typhoons landed in the province three times in a row. Storms brought mountain torrents, surging rivers, and seawater backflow, affecting 58 counties and cities. In summer and autumn, drought was also widespread in various parts of the province. In some counties in areas such as Jinhua and Wenzhou, it did not rain for more than two months. The total affected area of ​​flooded and drought-stricken farmland in the province reached more than 12.16 million mu, exceeding the affected area of ​​1953 and 1954, which were severely affected by disasters, but grain production broke through the highest level in history.
    Why was grain production still able to increase in Zhejiang Province this year, despite suffering such serious natural disasters? In addition to the active leadership and strong support of the Communist Party committees and people's committees at all levels in the province, the main reason is that farmers relied on the enormous organizational strength of agricultural production cooperatives to overcome natural disasters that could not be overcome when working individually. For example, in the Jinhua and Ningbo areas, after suffering from drought and typhoons this year, local agricultural cooperatives played a significant role in mutual support. For example, in Zhuji County, Jinhua Special District, by mobilizing agricultural cooperatives in mountainous areas to support agricultural cooperatives in lake areas to fight floods and drain waterlogging, and agricultural cooperatives in lake areas to support agricultural cooperatives in mountainous areas to fight drought, they not only overcame natural disasters, but also enabled this year's grain output to exceed the original grain production increase target by more than 35.5 million jin, an increase of 7.75% over last year.
    Promoting agricultural technology innovation on large areas of cultivated land is also an important reason for the increase in production in Zhejiang Province this year. This year, nearly 10 million mu of paddy fields in the province were converted to double-cropping intercropping rice and double-cropping continuous cropping rice, of which continuous cropping rice accounted for more than 6 million mu. Converting to double-cropping rice has a significant effect on increasing the yield per unit area of ​​rice. For example, after Lin'an County promoted double-cropping rice on a large scale this year, the unit area yield of rice per mu increased by 13.6% compared with last year and 42% compared with 1952. Another example is the Huayuan Agricultural Cooperative in Naxi Township, Linhai County, which converted 240 mu of land to a three-crop system this year, and every mu was a "thousand-jin field." Planting double-cropping rice requires more labor, fertilizer, and better soil and water conservancy conditions, which are not easily available to farmers when working individually.
    Since Zhejiang Province launched the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement in 1952, grain production has increased year by year, and it has changed from a grain-deficient province to a grain-surplus province in history. Although it suffered serious disasters this year, it still has surplus grain to be transferred to other places.

    发挥农业社集体力量　推行大面积技术革新
    浙江省今年增产粮食三亿多斤
    灾情严重为几十年所未有　粮食增产量却是空前的多
    本报讯　浙江省今年在数次严重的自然灾害的侵袭下，获得了空前的粮食增产。预计全省今年的粮食总产量可达到一百五十亿斤左右。比风调雨顺的1955年增产三亿两千多万斤，比解放前这个省粮食产量最高的1932年增产十一亿多斤。
    浙江省今年遭受了几十年所未有的严重自然灾害。8、9月间强台风连续三次在这个省登陆，暴风雨带来了山洪暴发、河水猛涨和海水倒灌，受灾地区波及五十八个县、市；夏秋，全省各地又普遍呈现旱象，严重的如金华、温州等地区的某些县，有两个多月没有下雨。全省受涝、受旱田亩共达一千二百十六万多亩，超过了受灾较严重的1953年和1954年的受灾面积，但粮食产量却突破了历史上最高水平。
    浙江省今年经受了这样严重的自然灾害，为什么粮食还能增产呢？除了这个省的中共各级党委和各级人民委员会的积极领导、大力扶持外，主要是由于农民依靠了农业生产合作社的巨大的组织力量，战胜了单干的时候无法战胜的自然灾害。例如金华、宁波地区，在今年遭受干旱和台风的袭击后，当地农业社就发挥了互相支援的重大作用。像金华专区的诸暨县，由于发动了山区农业社支援湖区农业社抗洪排涝，湖区农业社支援山区农业社抗旱，不仅战胜了自然灾害，还使今年的粮食产量可以超额三千五百多万斤完成原定的粮食增产指标，比去年增产7.75％。
    在大面积的耕地上推行农业技术革新，也是浙江省今年增产的重要原因。今年全省有近一千万亩的水稻田改种了双季间作稻和双季连作稻，其中连作稻有六百多万亩。改种双季稻对提高水稻单位面积产量有显著的作用。如临安县今年大面积推广双季稻后，水稻每亩的单位面积产量就比去年提高了13.6％，比1952年提高了42％；又如临海县楢溪乡花园农业社，今年改种了三熟制的二百四十亩田，亩亩都是“千斤田”。种植双季稻，需要较多的劳动力、肥料和较好的土壤、水利条件，这些条件是农民在单干的时候所不容易具备的。
    浙江省从1952年开展农业互助合作运动起，粮食产量就逐年增长，并且由历史上的缺粮省变为余粮省。今年虽然遭受了严重的灾害，但仍然有余粮外调。
