The giant sluice opens to welcome the flow of water,
Workers and peasants build the nation relying on talent.
Diverting the Yellow River water from the heavens,
To serve the people of the world.
Canals crisscross for three thousand miles,
People now know that human power can conquer nature.
Today, the alkaline and saline land is barren,
Next year, it will all be wheat and cotton fields.

　　贺打渔张引黄灌溉工程放水
    钱昌照巨闸迎流十丈开，工农建国赖群才，引将天上黄河水，尽为人间服务来。纵横渠道三千里，人力从知可胜天，今日碱盐光板地，来年尽变麦棉田。
