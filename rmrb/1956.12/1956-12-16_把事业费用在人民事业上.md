Spend Business Expenses on the People's Cause
　　Gao Changren
　　The Supervisory Office of the Hunan Provincial Department of Finance inspected the financial budgets of fifteen counties including Anren and Guiyang, and found that all counties had varying degrees of extravagance and waste in their procurement expenditures. This waste phenomenon was particularly prevalent and serious in the county's agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy departments.

　　This year, the Anren County Agriculture Bureau spent 1,200 yuan on bicycles, cameras, and radios. The former Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Bureau of Guiyang County (now divided into three bureaus) held four meetings in the first half of this year. Under the guise of meetings, they bought four bicycles, five alarm clocks, seven thermos bottles, and some other items, also spending 1,200 yuan. After the meetings, these items were taken for private use by some of the leaders in the agency. The Longhui County Agriculture Bureau recently ordered a similar plan costing 1,500 yuan. According to statistics from the agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy departments of nine counties, expenditures like the above have reached more than 50,000 yuan. As of early December, the Supervisory Office of the Hunan Provincial Department of Finance was still continuously receiving similar materials from lower-level supervisory institutions.

　　Why do the agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy departments of various counties spend so much money? It turns out they have "a lot of money." This money is not administrative expenses in the budget, but funds allocated by the state to them for the development of agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy. This year, many counties did not spend all of this special fund, so the leaders of these units used various pretexts to spend it arbitrarily. And some county people's committees approved their spending money so casually, because this could take care of the emotions of the cadres and would not affect the county's total financial budget.

　　Let's not talk about the fact that spending special funds on other expenses is a violation of the financial system, let's look at whether the things they bought are really necessary for work! The roads in rural Hunan are narrow and rugged, and it is difficult for cadres to use bicycles to go to the countryside. As a result, the only use for the bicycles they bought is for the leaders of these units to ride around the small county town for a stroll. And the cameras are also for their private use. There are also some units that buy typewriters and computers, which are rarely used a few times a year.

　　According to the inspection of the Supervisory Office of the Hunan Provincial Department of Finance, the misappropriation of special funds for extravagant expenses is also common in other units besides the agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy departments. Here, I don't want to put a lot of big hats on the heads of the leaders of these departments, but I suggest that the competent departments of various institutions formulate a strict system for the expenditure of next year's special funds; and I hope that the leaders of those grassroots units will, in the future, truly use special funds for the people's cause.

    把事业费用在人民事业上
    高长任
    湖南省财政厅监察室检查了安仁、桂阳等十五个县的财政总预算，发现各县在购置费的开支上，都有程度不同的铺张浪费现象。这种浪费现象特别普遍而严重的，是在县的农业、林业、水利三个部门。
    安仁县农业局今年花一千二百元买了自行车、照相机和收音机。桂阳县前农林水利局（现在已经分成三个局）在今年上半年召开过四次会议，借会议之名，买了四部自行车、五座闹钟、七个热水瓶和一些别的物品，也是花了一千二百元。这些物品，会后就由这个机关里的一些负责人私自取用了。隆回县农业局最近又订了一个类似的花一千五百元钱的计划。据九个县的农、林、水利部门统计，像上述的开支，已经达到五万多元。就在12月上旬，湖南省财政厅监察室还不断接到下级监察机构寄来类似的材料。
    为什么各县的农、林、水利部门花钱这样突出呢？原来他们“钱多”。这笔钱不是预算中的行政经费，而是国家拨给他们为发展农、林、水利事业的经费。今年，许多县的这笔事业费没有花完，于是，这些单位的负责人便利用种种名目来任意开支。而有些县的人民委员会对他们这样随便花钱，也照样批准，因为这样既可以照顾干部情绪，也不致影响县里的财政总预算。
    且不说把事业费随便用于其他的开支是违反财政制度的，就来看看他们买的这些东西是不是工作上真正必需的吧！湖南农村的道路是狭小崎岖的，干部下乡很难利用自行车。结果，他们买的自行车的唯一用途，便是供给这些单位的负责人在不大的县城里骑着车逛街兜风。而照相机也是供他们私人使用。还有一些单位买的打字机、计算机，一年很难用上几回。
    据湖南省财政厅监察室检查，挪用事业费作挥霍性开支的，除了农、林、水利部门之外，在其他单位也普遍存在。这里，我不想替这些部门的负责人戴上许多大帽子，只是建议各事业单位的主管部门在明年事业费的开支上，订出一个严格的制度；并且希望那些基层单位的负责人，今后把事业费真正用于人民的事业。
