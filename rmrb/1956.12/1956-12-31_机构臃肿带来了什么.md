What Has Bureaucratic Bloat Brought?
By Our Correspondent Liu Fan

What are the consequences of bureaucratic bloat? To find a concrete answer to this question, I visited the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Industry.

The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Industry now has eleven divisions and offices, including Planning, Finance, Personnel, Labor and Wages, Safety Technology, Capital Construction, Supply and Marketing, Water and Electricity, Supervision, and the General Office. In addition, there are seven specialized companies established at the beginning of this year from the original divisions and bureaus, including Textiles, Silk, Machinery, Heavy Industry, Light Industry, Paper Making, and Food, as well as an Electric Power Bureau. The number of administrative staff alone has increased from 370 in 1955 to 667. If we add the public institutions and organizations under construction, this department is now a large organization with 1,345 people.

Every time I walk into the gate of the Department of Industry, I see a constant flow of people in the corridors. Some are busy sending and distributing documents, while others are gathered in small groups discussing something. Now and then, someone calls for the director of a division to answer the phone, and then they call for cadres above the level of section chief to attend a meeting... From the surface, it seems like the work is very busy, but in reality, the workload is the same as last year, and the work in some divisions has even decreased compared to last year. Take the newly established seven specialized companies as an example. The work of many of these companies is no more than that of the specialized divisions before the company was established, but the number of personnel has increased several times over. For example, the Machinery Industry Specialized Company was just the Machinery and Farm Implements Division with 19 cadres last year, but now it has become a large company with 91 people, an increase of nearly four times. With more people and less work, the cadres have no choice but to spend their time reading books, reading newspapers, and chatting. Sometimes, they are so idle that they ask the leadership for work to do, and the leadership replies: "Your task at present is to read books."

Between 1951 and 1952, the administrative staffing of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Industry was only 151 people, but now it has expanded to 667 people. In four years, the number of administrative staff has increased more than threefold. How did this increase come about? Here, a popular reason is "as the enterprise develops, the organization and personnel must increase accordingly" and "the central departments are divided so finely that if the lower levels are not divided finely, it won't match the central government's standards. Don't even mention doing work, you won't even know which department to send someone to when going to a meeting in the central government." Based on these reasons, the Department of Industry has been blindly increasing personnel, especially during the high tide of socialist transformation, when more than 200 cadres from factories and mines and other personnel were transferred to blindly establish seven specialized companies. However, after the companies were established, due to unclear tasks, unclear responsibilities, too many people and too little work, they have been in a state of idleness for a long time, while the work is very chaotic. It is, of course, not objectionable to increase some personnel accordingly as the enterprise develops, but the industrial output value of the factories and mines under the Department of Industry only increased by 90% in 1956 compared to 1952, while the personnel increased by nearly three and a half times. Although the Department of Industry also puts forward the slogan and measures of streamlining the organization every year, in essence, the organization and personnel are increasing year by year. For example, in the first half of 1955, the Department of Industry had more than 370 administrative staff, but after the meeting on streamlining the organization, it increased to 419 people. Now it has increased to 667 people, while the staffing approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Establishment Committee is still 151 people. As a result, the salaries of the other 516 staff members have to be paid from the enterprise management funds of the factories, which amounted to 230,000 yuan in 1955 and 550,000 yuan in 1956.

With more people, housing has become a problem in the first place. Some departments have seven or eight people working in a very small office. There is no place to put desks, so two people have to share a desk. When you go out, I sit down, and when I go out, you come and sit down. Cadre dormitories are also becoming more and more tight every year. To this day, many cadres still live in the Gulou and Wulin hotels in Hangzhou.

With more people and less work, the number of cadres who are not at ease with their work is also increasing. According to incomplete statistics, most of the more than 100 cadres transferred from factories want to be transferred out of the Department of Industry and return to work in factories. With more personnel, the work of the personnel department has also increased. As a result, the original Personnel Division was expanded into two divisions of Personnel and Labor and Wages, and two sections of Labor Protection and Hygiene, and Security. The number of cadres doing personnel work increased from 24 in 1952 to 48.

Bureaucratic bloat, overlapping layers, and overstaffing inevitably lead to red tape, preoccupation with routine matters, and bureaucratic style. More than 100 people in the entire department are engaged in internal affairs of the organization. The department's general office has 36 staff members, with two directors, eight secretaries for confidential work, proofreading, production research, communications, and meetings, and a document handling group of 14 people dedicated to official documents. This group also has a document circulation station composed of five people, responsible for distributing documents, sending documents, writing triplicate forms, and circulating documents. A document has to go through four complicated procedures of distributing, sending, filling in triplicate forms, and registering in the circulation station, causing the document to travel for a long time. For a common example: In February 1955, the department received a document from the Supply and Marketing Bureau of the Local Industry Department, requesting the department to list the materials lacking for foreign orders in 1956 and report them to the central government by the end of February. This document was transferred by the circulation station to the seven divisions of Supply and Marketing, Capital Construction, Machinery and Farm Implements, Heavy Industry, Light Industry, Textile Management, and Food Industry, and the three bureaus of Electric Power, Silk, and Fiber. It ran all over the Department of Industry, passed through 38 checkpoints, and was stamped with 32 seals. It traveled in a courtyard of less than 100 meters in diameter and took 46 days to run out of the gate of the circulation station. The department also has an astonishing number of documents. According to statistics in 1956, there were 84,000 documents issued alone. Such a large number of documents has become a breeding ground for the preoccupation with routine matters and bureaucratic style of the leaders of the organization. Although the department has eight directors (one has now been transferred, one is recuperating, and one is studying), they are still overwhelmed by reading documents and attending meetings all day long. It is said that cadres below have to "make an appointment" to consult the director on work. Some cadres "find tricks" to wait for the director's two and a half hours of study time every week to find the director. Over time, it affected the director's study, so the department stipulated that "no work will be discussed during study time." The cadres then try to find the director when the director is doing exercises during work breaks every day. The directors also often want to go deep into the grassroots and overcome their bureaucratic style of being high above and not understanding the situation below, but they are entangled by the documents on their desks and various meetings all day long, how can they get away?

Now the Party Group of the Zhejiang Industrial Department of the CPC is studying a new plan to streamline the organization and improve work. It is said that this plan will be able to draw more than 200 people from the existing number of employees in the organization to strengthen the grassroots. This is a welcome phenomenon.

    机构臃肿带来了什么
    本报记者　刘凡
    机构臃肿带来了什么后果？为了具体地找到这个答案，我访问了浙江省工业厅。
    浙江省工业厅现在有计划、财务、人事、劳动工资、安全技术、基本建设、供销、水电、监察、办公室等十一个处室和今年年初从原有的处、局的基础上建立起来的纺织、丝绸、机械、重工业、轻工业、造纸、食品等七个专业公司和一个电业局。单行政管理人员就从1955年的三百七十人增加到六百六十七人，若加上事业机构和筹建机构，这个厅现在成了拥有一千三百四十五人的大机构了。
    我每次走进工业厅的大门，只见在那回廊里人们川流不息，一些人忙于送发文件，另一些则三三两两聚集在一起谈论些什么，一会儿有人叫处长听电话，一会儿又叫科长以上的干部开会……。从表面现象看来，工作是满紧张的，实际上工作仍和去年一样多，有些处的工作还比去年减少了。拿新成立的七个专业公司说，其中有不少公司的工作和去年没有改公司以前的专业处一样多，而人员却成倍地增加了。例如，机械工业专业公司，去年只是有十九个干部的机械农具处，现在变成了拥有九十一人的大公司，人员激增近四倍。人员多，工作少，干部们只好拿看书、看报、聊天来度光阴；有时实在闲得发慌，向领导上要工作做，领导上答复是：“目前你们的任务就是看看书”。
    1951年到1952年间，浙江省工业厅的行政编制只有一百五十一人，而现在扩大到六百六十七人，四年来，行政管理人员增加了三倍多。是怎样增加起来的呢？在这里有一种流行的理由是“事业发展了，机构和人员要相应增加”、“中央各部分得那样细，下面不分细，对不上中央的口径，不要说做工作，就连去中央开会都不知叫那个部门派人去。”根据这些理由，工业厅不断盲目增加人员，特别是在社会主义改造的高潮中，就抽调二百多厂矿干部和其他人员盲目地成立七个专业公司。可是公司建立以后，因为任务不清，责任不明，人多事少，长期陷入人员清闲而工作又十分混乱的境地。事业发展而相应地增加一些人员当然无可非议，但工业厅所属厂矿的工业产值1956年比1952年只增长90％，而人员却增加了近三倍半。虽然工业厅每年表面上也提出精简机构的口号和措施，而实质上机构和人员却在逐年增加。如1955年上半年工业厅有行政管理人员三百七十多人，精简机构的会议开过后，却增加到四百十九人。现在又增加到六百六十七人，而经浙江省编制委员会批准的编制仍然是一百五十一人。这样其他的五百一十六个工作人员工资不得不设法从各工厂的企业管理经费项下开支，这项开支1955年是二十三万元，1956年就已开支五十五万元。
    人多了，房子首先成了问题。有些部门七八人在一间很小的办公室工作。办公桌无处放，只好两个人合用一张桌子，你出去我坐上，我出去你来坐。干部宿舍也一年比一年紧张，至今还有许多干部住在杭州的鼓楼和武林旅馆里。
    人多，工作少，不安心工作的干部随着多起来。据不完全统计，有一百多从工厂调来的干部大部分想调离工业厅仍回工厂工作。人员多了，人事部门的事也多起来，于是原来的人事处扩大成人事、劳动工资两处和劳保卫生、保卫两科，做人事工作的干部从1952年的二十四人增加到四十八人。
    机构臃肿，层次重叠，人浮于事，不可避免地会带来文牍主义、事务主义和官僚主义的作风。全厅做机关内部事务的人员就有一百多人。厅的办公室有三十六个工作人员，有两个主任，有机要、校稿、生产调研、通讯、会议等八个秘书，有由十四个人组成的专为公文服务的行文组，这个组内还有一个五个人组成的公文运转站，负责分文、发文、写三联单、运转公文等事。一件公文光在运转站就要经过分、发、填三联单、登记四道繁复的手续，造成公文长期旅行。举个平常的例子：1955年2月间，该厅收到地方工业部供销总局公文，要该厅将1956年国外订货所缺材料，列具清单于2月底报中央。这件公文由运转站转到供销、基建、机械农具、重工业、轻工业、纺织管理、食品工业七个处和电业、丝绸、纤维三局，跑遍了工业厅，经过了三十八道关口，盖了三十二个图章，在方圆不到一百公尺的院落里，旅行了四十六天才跑出运转站的大门。这个厅公文也多得惊人。据1956年统计，单发文一项就有八万四千件。这样多的公文成了机关领导人员事务主义和官僚主义滋长的温床。这个厅虽然有八个厅长（现在一个已调走，一个休养，一个在学习），但仍整日为看公文、开会而应付不暇。据说，下面的干部找厅长请示工作要“预约挂号”，有些干部“找窍门”，专等厅里每星期两个半天的学习时间去找厅长，久而久之，影响了厅长的学习，于是厅里又规定“学习时间，概不接谈工作”。干部就又设法每天在厅长做工间操的时候去找厅长。厅长们也常常想深入下层，克服自己高高在上、不了解下情的官僚主义，可是他们整天被案头上的公文和各种各样的会议纠缠着，怎么离得开呢？
    现在中共浙江工业厅党组正研究精简机构、改进工作的新方案，据说这个方案将可从现有的机关人数中抽出二百多人，充实下层。这是一种可喜的现象。
