    Mistake
    In the Sixth Workshop of the state-owned Jilin Paper Mill, there was an "advanced group" and a "youth shock team" who gained honors by cheating and engaging in fraudulent practices. In the past two years, seven or eight workers have reported their despicable behavior to the workshop leaders. Even within this "advanced group," four workers had told the workshop leaders that their advanced deeds were not genuine. However, the leaders of the workshop's Party organization, administration, and trade union did not consider the opinions of the masses at all. Instead, they criticized those who offered suggestions as "conservative," "right-leaning," and "not accepting advanced experience." They even said, "If the experience of this group cannot be promoted, you will be held responsible."
    Later, as more and more workers raised objections, the workshop leaders were forced to inspect the "advanced group's" production, and only then did they understand the truth. It turned out that when evaluating this "advanced group," the workshop leaders simply passed it based on the foreman's report, and the factory leaders passed it based on the workshop leaders' report, without ever going to the masses to investigate and verify.
    This incident proves once again that if you do not solicit the opinions of the masses beforehand and do not listen to the voices of the masses afterward, even the most capable leaders will find it difficult to avoid turning good things into bad things, or mistaking errors for truths.

    弄错了
    国营吉林造纸厂第六车间，有一个靠弄虚作假骗得荣誉的
  “先进小组”和一个“青年突击手”。两年来，先后有七、八个工人向车间领导人员揭发他们的卑鄙行为。甚至在这个“先进小组”里，也有四个工人曾经告诉车间领导人员，说他们的先进事迹不真实。可是车间党组织、行政和工会的领导者，根本不考虑群众的意见，反而批评提意见的人“保守”、“右倾”、“不接受先进经验”；甚至说：“这个小组的经验推广不开，要你们负责。”
    后来，工人群众提意见的越来越多，车间领导人被迫检查了这个“先进小组”的生产，才明白了真象。原来，评定这个“先进小组”的时候，车间领导干部只是根据工长的报告通过的，厂的领导干部又是根据车间干部的报告通过的，根本没有到群众中去调查、对证。
    这件事又一次证明：事前不征求群众意见，事后又不倾听群众呼声，再能干的领导人也难于避免把好事做坏，或者把错误当成真理。
