　　A Dai Widow
　　——Travels in Western Yunnan
　　Peng Jingfeng
　　The Dai people are an affectionate ethnic group. Ask them to sing, and they will sing many beautiful love songs; ask them to tell stories, and they will tell many true love stories....
　　At night, when we returned from meetings in the Dai villages, we often saw a flashing, dark red light on the road by the fields in the distance. At first, I was often puzzled: how could there be so many night travelers every night? After a while, I realized that those were Dai young men going to distant villages to find their beloved girls!
　　When we stayed overnight in Dai villages, we were often awakened in the middle of the night by the lingering and melodious singing of Dai girls. Some of the singing came from bamboo groves, and some from under the shady old banyan trees. In the singing, we could also hear the low whistles of the young men, which seemed like responses and accompaniments.
　　People told many beautiful and moving stories, but the story of Guan Laomei impressed me the most:
　　She was from Xiannong Village in Yingjiang. Her husband died of illness a few years ago. That poor farmer left her no property other than two children. Her back was bent from labor, and she sweated profusely, but it was still difficult to feed her family of three. At that time, it was very difficult for a poor widow to live. There is a Dai proverb: "If a woman plows the field, even the ox will cry." Even if a woman has labor power, she cannot go to the fields to farm, and can only watch the fields become barren. She desperately needed a man to take care of her, but before land reform, when most Dai farmers were very poor, who would dare to marry a widow with two children!
　　Last winter, Yingjiang implemented peaceful land reform, and she quickly became an activist in the land reform. This spring, after Xiannong Village began to establish cooperatives, many people were still watching and hesitating. She and ten other peasant households were the first to join the cooperative.
　　Life gradually improved, and her mood became cheerful. She seemed to have regained her lost youth. A middle-aged farmer in the village began to pursue her passionately. Just as they were preparing to discuss marriage, some unpleasant things happened in the agricultural cooperative:
　　The director and deputy director quarreled because of disagreements, and the rich peasant elements were instigating from within, so that the production in the cooperative was very poor, and some members also felt that running the cooperative had no future and clamored to withdraw.
　　The man who was in love with Guan Laomei was originally a farmer outside the cooperative who had doubts about taking the cooperative road. He wanted Guan Laomei to withdraw from the cooperative, and claimed that otherwise, their love would be affected....
　　This was such a difficult thing for Guan Laomei! She loved this newly established cooperative. She had suffered hardships for half her life and deeply understood that only by relying on cooperation could she embark on a happy path; but she also loved that man. She knew that she was a middle-aged woman whose youth would not return, and she could not let the love and warmth she had just hoped for be lost like this....
　　I don't know how many nights she didn't sleep well, and I don't know how many tears she shed. When she repeatedly explained to that man without success, she finally gritted her teeth and said to the man:
　　"If you want me to withdraw from the cooperative, I cannot marry you."
　　After saying that, she fully participated in the rectification work, going from house to house with those activists to publicize the future of agricultural cooperation and expose the plots of the rich peasants. Seeing that even a widow was so resolute, those men who had wavered felt ashamed. They said, "What? Are we men less reasonable than women in skirts?"
　　The "Xiannong" cooperative, which was about to collapse, was consolidated again.
　　Unfortunately, I left Yingjiang at that time. I don't know what happened to Guan Laomei and that man afterwards. It is said that the man regretted it a bit. I believe she will live happily; and that man, when he quickly understands the benefits of the cooperative, will also deeply feel how lovely Guan Laomei is!

　　一个傣族寡妇
　　——滇西记行
　　彭荆风
    傣族是个多情的民族。叫傣族人唱歌，他们会唱很多美丽的情歌；叫傣族人讲故事，他们也会讲很多、很真实的恋爱故事……。
    夜晚，当我们在傣族村寨开完会回来时，常看到远处田边大道上有一闪闪的暗红色火光。最初，我常感到迷惑，怎么每夜有这么多夜行人呢？时间长了，我才知道，那是傣族的小伙子到远处村寨去找自己心爱的姑娘呢！
    我们夜宿在傣族村寨时，半夜，也常会被傣族姑娘那缠绵婉转的歌声所惊醒，那歌声有的来自竹丛林里，有的来自密荫的老榕树下边。歌声中还可以听到小伙子们那似乎是回答、又是伴奏的低低口哨声。
    人们讲了许多美丽而又动人的故事，但，给我印象最深的却是管老妹的故事：
    她是盈江先弄寨人，丈夫在前几年就病死了，那位贫苦的农民，除了留下两个孩子外，没有给她留下一点财产。她的腰累弯了，汗水流尽了，每天还是难使一家三口人吃口饱饭。那时，一个清贫的寡妇是很难生活的，傣族有句民谚：“妇女犁田，牛都会哭”。即使妇女有劳动力也不能去下田种地，只能眼看着田地荒废。她很需要一个男人来照顾她，但在土地改革以前，大多数傣族农民都很贫困的时候，谁敢要一个有着两个孩子的寡妇呵！
    去年冬天，盈江这一带实行了和平土地改革，她很快的就成了土地改革中的积极分子。今年春天，先弄寨开始建立合作社后，很多人都还在观望徘徊，她和十户农民首先参加了合作社。
    生活逐渐好过了，心情也变得愉快了，她似乎又恢复了那失去的青春，寨子里的一个中年农民开始热烈地追求她。当他们正准备商量嫁娶问题的时候，农业合作社里却发生了一些不愉快的事：
    社长和副社长因为意见不合发生了争执，富农分子又在从中挑拨，以致社里的生产搞得很糟，一部分社员也认为办社没有前途了，闹嚷着要准备退社。
    和管老妹谈恋爱的那个男人，本来就是一个对走合作化道路抱着怀疑态度的社外农民，他要管老妹也退社，并且声称：否则，他们之间的爱情就会受到影响……。
    这对管老妹是多么为难的一件事呵！她爱这个新办起来的合作社，她这半辈子受尽了艰辛，深深懂得只有依靠合作化才能走幸福的道路；但，她也爱那个男人，她知道自己已是个青春不易再来的中年人了，她不能让刚盼望到的爱情和温暖就这样失掉……。
    也不知道多少个夜晚没有睡好觉，也不知道流了多少眼泪，当她对那个男人一再解释而没有用时，她终于咬着牙对那男人说道：
  “你要我退社，我不能嫁给你。”
    说完了，她就全力参加了整社工作，同那些积极分子一起挨家挨户去宣传农业合作化的前途，去揭发富农的阴谋。看到一个寡妇都这样坚决，那些曾经动摇过的男子汉也感到羞惭了，他们说：“怎么？我们男子汉还比不上穿裙子的妇人家懂得道理多？”
    本来要垮的“先弄”合作社又重新巩固了下来。
    可惜，我就在那时离开了盈江，我不知道管老妹和那个男人以后到底怎样了。据说，那个男人又有些后悔。我相信她一定会过得幸福；那个男人在很快明白了合作社的好处时，他也一定会深刻感到，管老妹是个多么可爱的人呵！
