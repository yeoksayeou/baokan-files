　　“Prepared But Not Used” Translators

　　In May 1955, the Nonferrous Metals Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry started a Russian training class, transferring thirty-six translators from various factories and mines, as well as graduates from Russian language programs, to serve as teachers. By October, as the number of students decreased, some of the teachers became idle. The school leadership then formed these idle people into a "teaching and research group," going to each class every day to listen in, in order to conduct so-called "research and summarize teaching experience." In November of last year, sixteen more translators were transferred in. Apart from nine taking on tutorial classes, the rest had no choice but to be sent to the "teaching and research group." Some were transferred to do typing and long-term administrative work.

　　By the beginning of 1956, the number of fully and partially idle teachers had reached twenty-three, accounting for more than half of the entire teaching staff. As a result, the Nonferrous Metals Bureau "dispersed" some people to factories and mines and formed others into a translation group to translate some things that could be translated or not. The situation since July this year has become even more serious, with almost all the remaining teachers having no work to do.

　　Comrades have raised many opinions about this serious phenomenon of backlog and waste of translation resources and have requested job transfers. The Nonferrous Metals Bureau replied, "We still lack translators. As for the phenomenon of overstaffing in the Russian training class, we are gradually resolving it." But what is the reality? Six translators have been transferred to teach courses such as politics, chemistry, and mathematics.

　　The Central South Tungsten Mining Bureau does not need translators at all, but the Nonferrous Metals Bureau has sent eight translators there this year. In August, the Central South Tungsten Mining Bureau sent a letter to the Nonferrous Metals Bureau stating that they did not need translators, but as a result, another one was sent. The Tungsten Mining Bureau could not deal with it and had nowhere to send him, so they had to ask the Gannan Special Zone Party Committee to help solve the problem. This translator is still staying at the guest house to this day.

　　I hope that the relevant leaders of the Nonferrous Metals Bureau will immediately correct this shortcoming of not valuing translation cadres and use them rationally.　Li Shengyang

　　“Training Soldiers for a Thousand Days, Using Them for One Morning”

　　The current shipping tasks are busy and tense, one of the reasons being the lack of shipping personnel. However, the Chongqing Shipping Company of the Sichuan Provincial Inland River Bureau has accumulated and idled a large number of seamen, neither transferring them nor lending them out.

　　The Chongqing Shipping Company has only ten small ships but owns more than four hundred seamen, the vast majority of whom are technical personnel for large ships. Due to the shortage of ships and the surplus of people, they cannot arrange their work. The leaders of the company came up with a plan of "training soldiers for a thousand days, using them for one morning," assigning two captains to one ship; for example, the Chuanhang 404 ship has Chen Guanghan and Zhao Bingyun, while many others are idle. Because they have nothing to do and are bored, they have repeatedly requested work or to be transferred to other bureaus, but the leaders simply ignore them.

　　The Sichuan River Navigation Engineering Office is carrying out urgent dredging work and needs to transport equipment but lacks seamen. Knowing that the Sichuan Provincial Inland River Bureau has a large number of idle personnel, they contacted them to borrow some. However, the leaders of this bureau neither agreed to transfer them nor to lend them out.

　　I am appealing for these personnel, asking the leaders not to "accumulate" them anymore!

　　Too Many People, Nothing to Do

　　The situation of stockpiling talent in the Taiyuan Electrical Installation Engineering Office, which is under the Installation Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, is serious.

　　According to the engineering tasks and the fixed number of cadres allocated, the Taiyuan Electrical Installation Engineering Office should have more than one hundred and forty people. Later, they automatically increased it to one hundred and ninety-two people. Because the initial planned tasks were overestimated, after in-depth investigation, the tasks were reduced by more than five times. According to the tasks, fifty cadres would be enough. However, the number of cadres was not reduced accordingly, but instead increased from one hundred and ninety-two to two hundred and fifty.

　　Due to the surplus of people and the shortage of work, the waste of labor is serious. For example, the nursery for three children employs two nannies, and the cafeteria for fifty people has thirteen management and cooking staff. More strangely, many people have nothing to do all day long, but the leaders continue to ask the higher authorities to supplement cadres.

　　We have made suggestions to the leaders many times, requesting to change this situation, but the leaders have ignored them. We hope that the relevant units will conduct inspections and deal with the matter.

　　We Can't Wait Any Longer, Editor:

　　We are graduates of the Shenyang Machine Manufacturing School and were assigned to work as teachers at the Shenyang Industrial Cadre School of the Second Machine Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Industry in August this year. However, until now, we seem like a pile of "surplus materials."

　　When we reported to the Education Department of the Second Machine Industry Bureau in Beijing, the responsible comrade said:
　　"Beijing is very fun, you can go sightseeing first." Later, he said: "The school is under construction, you should go to the factory for internship first."

　　We came to the Shenyang Machine Tool Factory No. 1 with the director's personal letter of introduction, but were not received because we did not have file materials. After our repeated negotiations, we managed to get the internship procedures. However, what to intern in? How to intern? We had no idea, and no one assisted, guided, or helped arrange the internship plan. Our living problems were also not reasonably resolved. We wrote several letters in a row, asking the First Ministry of Machine Industry to tell us the date of the start of school. In mid-October, the bureau sent a female comrade, promising to solve some of our living and internship problems and telling us that "the school will not open until 1958." We believe that this is stockpiling talent and an unreasonable practice. But she said that this was a question of "attitude towards the revolution" and asked us to wait patiently. She put us up in hotels, and the rent alone for seven people would cost more than four thousand yuan a year.

　　Our great motherland is carrying out magnificent construction, but what about us? Carrying the false name of internship, we are wasting our time here. We request the First Ministry of Machine Industry to quickly assign us work.

　  “备而不用”的翻译人员
    1955年5月，冶金工业部有色金属管理局开办了一个俄文训练班，从各厂矿调来了三十六个翻译人员以及俄专毕业分配来的学生担任教员。到10月份，随着学生的减少，有一部分教员便闲起来了。学校领导上便将这些闲散的人组成一个“教研组”，每天到各班去听课，以便搞所谓“研究和总结教学经验”。去年11月又调来十六位翻译，除了九位担任辅导课外，其余的也只好送往“教研组”。个别的被调去打字和搞长期性的行政事务工作。
    到1956年初，全闲和半闲的教员已达二十三位，占全体教员的一半以上。于是有色局又把一部分人“疏散”到厂矿去，把一部分人组成翻译组，来翻译一些可译可不译的东西。今年7月以来的情况更为严重，留下来的教员几乎全部没有工作。
    对这种严重积压和浪费翻译力量的现象，同志们曾提过不少意见，并要求调动工作。有色局答复说：“我们还缺翻译，至于俄文训练班人浮于事的现象，我们正逐步解决”。而事实又是怎样呢？有六个翻译曾被调去教政治、化学、数学等课程。
    中南钨矿局根本不需要翻译，而有色局在今年却先后送去八位翻译。8月份中南钨矿局曾去函有色局说明不需要翻译，但是结果又送来一位。钨矿局无法处理，无处可送，只得请赣南专区党委协助解决。这位翻译他直到现在仍然住招待所。
    我希望有色局有关领导上立即纠正这种对翻译干部不重视的缺点，合理地使用他们。　李盛杨
　  “养兵千日，用在一朝”
    目前的航运任务是繁忙而紧张的，原因之一是航务人员缺乏。但是四川省内河局重庆轮船公司，把大批的海员积压和闲置起来，不调不借。
    重庆轮船公司仅有小型轮船十艘，却拥有海员四百多人，其中绝大部分还是大型轮船的技术人员。由于船少人多，无法安排他们的工作，该公司领导人就来了一个“养兵千日，用在一朝”的打算，把一个船配上两个船长；如川航404号轮船就有陈光汉、赵炳云两个人，其余很多的人就闲置起来。由于无事可作，闷得慌，他们也一再要求给工作，不然就调到外局去，但是领导人员根本不理。
    川江航运工程处在进行紧急疏浚工作中，运送器材而无海员，知道四川省内河局有大批闲置人员，便与他们联系借用。但是这个局的领导人员既不同意调出，也不同意借用。
    我为这批人员呼吁，要求领导上不要再把他们“积压”了！
                          刘仰之
    人多没事做
    建筑工程部安装工程总局所属太原电气安装工程处，积压人材的情况是严重的。
    太原电气安装工程处根据工程任务和配备干部的定额应为一百四十多人，后来又自动增加到一百九十二人。由于最初计划任务估计过高，经过深入调查以后把任务降低了五倍多，根据任务有五十名干部就够了。但是任务削减了干部并未相应的减少，反而又由一百九十二人增加到二百五十人。
    由于人多事少，浪费劳动力的情况是严重的。如三个小孩的托儿所就用了两个保育员，五十个人的食堂却有管理和炊事人员十三人。更奇怪的是很多人一天到晚没事做，而领导上却继续向上级要求补充干部。
    以上情况，我们曾多次向领导上提出建议，要求改变这种状况，但是领导上都置之不理。我们希望有关单位进行检查和处理。
              区鹤龄、郑鹏源等
　  我们不能再等下去了编辑同志：
    我们是沈阳机器制造学校毕业的学生，今年8月被分配在第一机械工业部第二机器工业管理局沈阳工业干部学校作教师。可是，直到现在我们好像一堆“多余的材料”。
    当我们到北京第二机器工业管理局教育处报到时，负责同志说：
  “北京很好玩，可先去逛逛名胜”。后来又说：“学校正在建设，你们先下厂实习”。
    我们带着处长的亲笔介绍信来到了沈阳机床一厂，因没有档案材料而不予接待。经过我们多次交涉才算办到了实习手续。可是，实习什么？怎么实习？心里没底，也没有人协助指导帮助安排实习计划。在生活问题上也得不到合理解决。我们接连写了几封信，要求第一机械工业部告诉我们开学的日期。10月中旬，局里派来了一位女同志，答应解决我们生活和实习上的一些问题，并告诉我们“学校要在1958年才能开学”。我们认为这是积压人材，不合理的作法。可是她说这是“对待革命的态度”问题，并叫我们耐心等待。把我们安顿在旅馆里，光房租七个人一年就得四千多元。
    我们伟大的祖国正在进行宏伟的建设，然而我们呢？背着实习的虚名，在这里虚度光阴，我们请求第一机械工业部迅速给我们分配工作。
