    Hubei Province's Many Cities and Towns
    Rationally Reduce Grain Sales
    The grain rationing inspection work carried out in many cities and towns in Hubei Province has achieved certain results. In Yidu County, grain sales in November decreased by 8.89% compared to October and by 16% compared to the same period last year. The planned grain consumption for industry and commerce in Macheng County this month was 14% lower than in November, a reduction of more than 100,000 jin. In Xishui County, more than twenty catering units turned in 7,600 jin of excess grain purchased and more than 1,200 jin of surplus grain coupons. In the past, the Yichang County People's Bank did not turn in excess grain coupons when cadres returned from the countryside. Now, they have established a grain coupon registration system and strictly implement grain coupon settlement and recovery methods.
    Recently, the Hubei Provincial People's Committee, at a meeting of commissioners and mayors, made further arrangements for the current grain work: requiring all localities to appropriately reduce grain supply standards and appropriately reduce the precision of rice and flour processing. It also called for strengthening the management of fixed-quantity supply in cities and towns, preventing waste of grain, and strictly prohibiting false reporting of population. Floating populations are to be supplied with grain coupons. Currently, more than half of the counties are implementing this spirit and will conduct another general inspection and rectification in December to effectively reduce unreasonable grain sales.

    A Grain Supply Station in Shenyang
    Promotes Grain Conservation Among Residents
    Among the more than 1,600 households served by the Second Grain Supply Station on Suichuan Street in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, from July to November, 86 households handed over 1,279 jin of grain saved to the state, and 14 households that were short 164 jin of grain also made up the full amount.
    Starting in July this year, the staff of this grain supply station divided into designated areas and spent a certain amount of time going deep into residential groups to visit residents and publicize the benefits of saving grain for the country. Initially, residents had concerns and were unwilling to hand over the surplus grain. However, the staff did not give up and were determined to dispel residents' concerns. They patiently explained to residents and mobilized them to hand over the monthly surplus grain to the state, promising to provide subsidies if they did not have enough to eat, ensuring they had enough. In addition, salesperson Wang Hongxing specially prepared needles and thread, and when he saw a resident's rice bag was leaking, he would take it and sew it up, and pick up the rice grains that fell on the ground. Once, an elderly man could not carry the rice he bought, so administrator Qu Zengxue carried the rice bag to his home. In August, when salespeople visited residential groups, they found that residents Zhang Yazhen and Xu Guofu were short fifteen jin of grain. After investigation, it was confirmed, and they were given a subsidy. These facts moved many residents. Residents took the initiative to save grain and voluntarily handed over surplus grain. Because Zhang Guohua's family had a surplus of grain, he bought 50 jin less when he went to the grain supply station to buy grain in November. Resident Bai Yongji handed over the 30 jin of grain coupons his family saved to salesperson Zhao Yongshan, who often visited their residential group.
    Now, the relationship between this grain supply station and the residents is even closer. Letters of commendation are constantly being sent from the residents. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Collective Catering Units in Shanghai
    Save Three Million Jin of Grain
    More than 5,000 factory enterprises, government agencies, and school canteens in Shanghai saved more than three million jin of grain this year. Of this grain, more than 1.3 million jin have been handed over to the state, with the remainder retained for turnover.
    Canteens universally implemented the method of steaming rice to increase the rice yield rate and accurately counted the number of diners, reducing leftover rice. As a result, a lot of grain was saved. In addition, people ate less in the summer, also leaving a portion of grain.
    Since November, canteens in Shanghai have implemented a grain settlement system, handing over surplus grain on a monthly basis. (Xinhua News Agency)

    再接再厉，节约粮食
    湖北省许多城镇
    合理压缩粮食销量
    湖北省许多城镇进行的粮食定量供应检查工作，已经取得一定成绩。宜都县11月份销售的粮食，比10月份下降8.89％，比去年同期下降16％。麻城县工商行业这个月的计划用粮比11月份降低了14％，减少十万多斤。浠水县二十多个伙食单位交出多买的粮食七千六百斤、多余的粮票一千二百多斤。宜昌县人民银行过去干部下乡回来多余的粮票也不上交，现在他们建立了粮票登记制度，严格执行粮票结算回笼办法。
    最近，湖北省人民委员会在专员市长会议上，对当前粮食工作作了进一步的安排：要求各地适当压缩粮食供应标准和适当降低米面加工精度。并且加强市镇定量供应管理，防止浪费粮食，严禁虚报人口，流动人口一律凭粮票供应。目前有半数以上的县正在贯彻这一精神，并在12月份再进行一次普遍的检查和整顿，切实压缩不合理的粮食销量。　（李金堂）
    沈阳一粮食供应站
    推动居民节约粮食
    辽宁省沈阳市遂川街第二粮食供应站负责供应的一千六百多户居民中，从7月到11月，有八十六户居民把节余下来的一千二百七十九斤粮食交给国家，有十四户居民缺粮一百六十四斤也按数补足。
    今年7月份起，这个粮食供应站的工作人员分片包干，抽出一定时间深入到居民组中去访问，向居民宣传为国家节约粮食的好处。起初，居民有顾虑，不肯交出剩余的粮食。但是，工作人员并不泄气，决心打消居民的顾虑。他们耐心地向居民解释，动员他们把每月剩余的粮食交给国家，不够吃可以给予补助，保证够吃。此外，营业员王洪兴特别预备了针线，看见居民米袋漏了，就拿过来给缝好，并且把掉在地上的米粒拣起来。有一次，一个老人买米扛不动，管理员曲增学扛起米袋给他送到家里。8月间，营业员深入居民组访问的时候，发现居民张亚珍、徐国富缺粮十五斤，经过调查属实，就给他们补上了。这些事实使很多居民受到了感动。居民纷纷自动节约粮食，并且自愿交出剩余的粮食。居民张国华由于家里粮食有节余，11月间他到粮食供应站买粮食的时候，就少买了五十斤。居民白永吉把他家节余下来的三十斤粮票，交给常到他们居民组里访问的营业员赵永善。
    现在，这个粮食供应站和居民的关系更加密切了。表扬信不断地从居民中寄来。　（新华社）
    上海集体伙食单位
    节余粮食三百万斤
    上海市有五千多个工厂企业、机关、学校的伙食团，今年节余了三百多万斤粮食。这些粮食除一部分留作周转以外，有一百三十多万斤已经交给国家。
    各伙食团普遍实行蒸饭方法，提高出饭率，并且准确统计用膳人数，减少剩饭。因此，节余了很多粮食。另外，用膳的人在夏季饭量减少，也剩下一部分粮食。
    从11月起，上海各伙食团已经实行用粮决算制度，余粮按月上交。　（新华社）
