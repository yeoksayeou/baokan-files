    Should Not Go to Tanggu to Speculate and Purchase Aquatic Products
    Since November, some commercial units from Shanghai, Shenyang, Jinxi, and other places, such as Jilin Huadian Trading Company and Suizhong Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company, have been going to Tanggu Aquatic Products Area in Tianjin to speculate and purchase fish and shrimp. According to statistics from relevant departments, these units have purchased more than 130,000 jin of yellow croaker, smelt, and other fish. The price of speculation is higher than the purchase price of the local Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company. In mid-November, the local listed price for yellow croaker was 0.37 yuan per jin, but they offered 0.41 yuan per jin, and recently it has been raised to 0.50 yuan per jin.
    The aquatic products of Tanggu not only supply the market needs of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places, but also bear a certain export task. The State Council's instructions on relaxing the management of rural markets mentioned that the aquatic products of several fishing areas (Zhoushan, Qingdao, Yantai, Tanggu, and Dalian) must still be uniformly purchased by state-owned commercial companies or entrusted supply and marketing cooperatives. Arbitrarily going to Tanggu to speculate or rush to purchase aquatic products is obviously an illegal act. Zhao Xiuxue

    不该到塘沽套购水产品
    11月以来，上海、沈阳、锦西等地一些商业单位，如吉林华甸贸易公司、绥中水产供销公司等，到天津塘沽水产区去套购鱼虾。据有关部门统计，仅黄花鱼、紫丁鱼等，就被这些单位购去了十三万多斤。套购的价格，高于当地水产供销公司的收购价。11月中旬，当地牌价每斤黄花鱼三角七分，他们出四角一分一斤，最近已抬高到五角一斤。
    塘沽的水产，不仅供应北京、天津、上海等地的市场需要，还负担着一定的出口任务。国务院关于放宽农村市场管理问题的指示中曾经提到：若干渔产区（舟山、青岛、烟台、塘沽、旅大）的水产品，都必须仍由国营商业公司或者委托供销社统一收购，随便到塘沽套购或抢购水产品，显然是一种非法的行为。　赵修学
