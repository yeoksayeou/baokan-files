    Contradictory Phenomena in Publishing Work
    Books are Both Scarce and Abundant
    Ministry of Culture is Working on Solutions

    (Reported by this newspaper) Currently, there is a serious problem of subjectivism in the national book publishing and distribution system. Many publishing houses are blindly publishing books, and Xinhua Bookstore is blindly ordering them, resulting in a large backlog of books and wasting a lot of the state's paper. At the same time, many books urgently needed by readers cannot be met. This serious shortcoming in the work of the publishing and distribution system has aroused dissatisfaction among many readers.

    Many publishing houses, without regard to the needs of the masses, blindly pursue the quantity of books published, resulting in serious stockpiles. For example, 11.65 million copies of the "Draft Model Regulations for Agricultural Production Cooperatives" were printed, and now 4 million copies are stockpiled; the "Outline for Agricultural Development Wall Chart" published by the PLA Pictorial Press was printed in 400,000 sets, with more than 60% in stock. For example, the book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" (selected paperback) was stockpiled with 3 million copies, equivalent to more than 1,000 tons of paper, because it was published late and the print run was too large.

    Many books published by publishing houses to coordinate movements, promote policies, and exchange work experience have serious duplication of content. According to incomplete statistics from the Xinhua Bookstore Main Store in November this year, among the 13 categories of books published by publishing houses across the country, more than 320 kinds of books with duplicate or similar content totaled more than 20 million copies; more than half of them were published in 1956. For example, 63 kinds of books were published on the promotion of agricultural cooperation; 48 kinds of books were published on rice cultivation and yield increase technology; and 39 kinds of books were published on how to run rural clubs. As many as 51 kinds of pamphlets on pig raising have been published across the country, all explaining the experience, significance, seed selection, mating, feeding management, and disease prevention and treatment of pig raising.

    The phenomenon of large numbers of books with duplicate content also exists in the publication of general political books, literary books, children's books, and comic strips. For example, a total of 10 kinds of political books were published nationwide on the promotion of the First Five-Year Plan, with mostly the same content. In terms of literary books, "Dangerous Road" was published by three publishing houses; "Tracing to the End" was published by four publishing houses, and so on. The comic strip "Han Meimei" was published in seven versions by seven publishing houses. For example, regarding books on cultural learning, Shanghai People's Publishing House published a set of "Supplementary Readings for Learning Culture"; Jiangsu also published a set of "Supplementary Readings for Learning Culture"; Hunan published "Workers and Peasants Cultural Readings"; Sichuan published "Literacy Auxiliary Readers"; Beijing published "Supplementary Readings for Learning Culture"; and Popular Reading Publishing House also published "Works of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers", "Supplementary Language Readings", etc.

    Because many publishing houses blindly pursue the quantity of books published, they simply cut and paste articles published in newspapers and magazines and compile them for publication. This shoddy practice seriously affects the quality of manuscripts, making many publications out of touch with reality and even making mistakes.

    All these books have caused a large backlog in bookstores. However, books urgently needed by readers are rarely published. At present, readers urgently need some reference books, teaching reference books, science and technology books, classical literary works, and certain classical theoretical works. For example, readers everywhere have reflected that they need a decent "dictionary", but none has been published at all. Many good books recommended by the Ministry of Education to secondary schools as auxiliary reading materials for high school Chinese, such as "Selected Poems from the Book of Songs", "Three Hundred Tang Poems", and "Dream of the Red Chamber", are simply not available in Xinhua bookstores everywhere. As for the readers' reflection that they cannot buy the reference books they urgently need in their march towards science, and that cadres on the job cannot buy learning documents and reference books in their theoretical studies, this is also a common phenomenon.

    The chaotic phenomena in the current book publishing work have attracted the attention of the leaders of the Ministry of Culture. In recent weeks, Zhang Zhixiang, Vice Minister of Culture, and the person in charge of the Publishing Administration, have held continuous symposiums to solicit opinions from all parties on publishing work and to listen to reports from the heads of various publishing houses. The Ministry of Culture is preparing to conduct in-depth investigations into the problems in publishing work in order to further improve publishing work.

    出版工作中的矛盾现象
    书籍又缺又滥
    文化部正着手研究解决办法
    本报讯　目前在全国书籍出版发行系统中，存在着严重的主观主义作风。许多出版社盲目地出书，新华书店盲目地订货，造成大批书籍的积压，浪费了国家大量的纸张。同时，读者迫切需要的许多书籍，不能满足需要。出版发行系统工作中的这种严重缺点，已经引起很多读者的不满。
    许多出版社不根据群众需要，盲目追求书籍出版数量，造成严重积压。例如，“农业生产合作社示范章程草案”印了一千一百六十五万册，现在积压四百万册；解放军画报社出版的“农业发展纲要挂图”印了四十万套，存货在百分之六十以上。又如，“中国农村的社会主义高潮”（选本平装）一书，因为出版时间迟，印数过多，积压了三百万册，折合纸张一千多吨。
    出版社出版的许多配合运动、宣传政策和交流工作经验的书籍，内容重复的现象十分严重。据新华书店总店在今年十一月的不完全统计，全国各出版社出版的十三类书籍中，内容重复或大同小异的书籍达三百二十余种，总印数达二千万册以上；其中1956年出版的种类占了一半以上。例如，有关宣传农业合作化的书籍出了六十三种；有关水稻栽培增产技术的书籍，出版了四十八种；有关如何办农村俱乐部的书籍，也出了三十九种。关于养猪的小册子，全国竟出版了五十一种之多，内容都是讲解养猪的经验、意义、选种、配种、饲养管理和猪病预防治疗等知识。
    大批书籍内容重复的现象，在一般政治书籍、文学书籍、少年儿童读物和连环画的出版方面，也同样存在。例如，关于宣传第一个五年计划的政治书籍，全国共出了十种，内容大都相同。在文学书籍方面，“危险的路”一书，有三个出版社出版；“追查到底”一书，有四个出版社出版，等等。连环画“韩梅梅”共有七个出版社出了七种版本。又如，关于文化学习方面的书籍，上海人民出版社出了一套“学文化补充读物”；江苏也出了一套“学文化补充读物”；湖南出版了“工农文化读物”；四川出版了“扫盲辅助读本”；北京出版了“学文化补充读物”；通俗读物出版社也出版了“工农兵作品”、“语文补充读物”等等。
    由于许多出版社盲目追求书籍出版的数量，因此，随便把报纸、杂志上发表的文章剪贴起来汇辑出版。这种粗制滥造的做法，严重影响了书稿质量，使得许多出版物内容脱离实际，甚至发生错误。
    所有这些书籍，在书店里造成了大量积压。但是，读者迫切需要的书籍却很少出版。目前，读者迫切需要一些工具书、教学参考用书、科学技术书、古典文学作品和某些经典理论著作。例如，各地读者纷纷反映需要一本像样的“辞典”，而目前根本没有出版。教育部向中等学校推荐的作为高中语文辅助读物的如“诗经选”“唐诗三百首”“红楼梦”等好多种书，各地新华书店根本无货供应。至于读者反映在向科学进军中买不到他们迫切需要的参考书籍，在职干部在理论学习中买不到学习文件和参考书籍，也是普遍的现象。
    目前书籍出版工作中的混乱现象已经引起文化部领导方面的注意。最近几个星期以来，文化部副部长张致祥和出版事业管理局的负责人，连续召开座谈会，征求各方面对出版工作的意见，并听取各出版社负责人的汇报。文化部准备对出版工作中的问题进行深入调查，以便进一步改进出版工作。
