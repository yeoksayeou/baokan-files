Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from New York: The United Nations General Assembly concluded the general debate of its current session on the morning of December 6th. Representatives from countries including Iraq, the United Kingdom, and India spoke at the assembly.

Indian representative Menon said in his speech that India regretted Japan's absence from the United Nations General Assembly, and he also expressed the hope that the Mongolian People's Republic could soon enter the United Nations.

Menon also said that he believed the issue of restoring the lawful seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations was still to be resolved by the General Assembly. He said: "Whether we like it or not, China's cooperation is becoming increasingly necessary."

Menon then said that India believes that the most important colonial issue in the world today is the Algerian question. "Our goal on the Algerian issue is the same as our own goal in the past, which is to achieve the independence of that territory." He also talked about the Cyprus issue, the West Irian issue, and the Goa issue. Menon said that Goa remains an unpleasant bump on our territory.

Menon also talked about the issue of discrimination against people of Indian descent in the Union of South Africa and the Kashmir issue. He said, "We hope to see the aggression in Kashmir cease."

When talking about disarmament, Menon said that we have been talking about disarmament for eleven years, and every year the world's armaments either remain at the same level or reach a higher level. If the main countries concerned in this matter, the United States and the Soviet Union, can reach some kind of agreement, then we will all welcome such an agreement, but if that cannot be done, then we should be able to make a start.

When talking about the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, Menon said that this invasion was prepared for several months. He said that describing part of the purpose of this invasion as "eliminating Soviet influence in Egypt" was "completely an afterthought" excuse, because "there was no Soviet influence in Egypt." He also said that the United Nations Emergency Force cannot be seen as "the nucleus of a future army." When talking about the situation in Hungary, Menon said, "We advocate that the Hungarian people have the right to organize the government they desire. We hope that foreign troops will withdraw from all countries."

British representative Dixon, in his speech, tried to confuse the United Nations resolutions to stop Anglo-French aggression with resolutions interfering in Hungary's internal affairs, saying, "The rule of law should be applied equally to everyone."

Dixon insisted that Egypt was deliberately obstructing the navigation of the canal and said that it was necessary to guard against the "danger" of the Middle East region being "open to Soviet communism." Dixon also threatened that if Egypt continues to maintain its national sovereignty through propaganda, etc., the work of resolving the Middle East issue "will not be smoother."

When talking about disarmament, Dixon said:
	"As far as my government is concerned, we believe that any comprehensive disarmament plan must be carried out in stages and must be linked to the solution of important political issues."

Iraqi representative Jamali criticized Zionism in his speech, believing that this is the root of unrest in the Middle East and that Western colonialists want to "establish a bridgehead in the Middle East."

The general debate ended at 1:59 p.m. local time.

　  联合国大会结束一般性辩论
　　梅农驳斥英法侵埃的荒谬借口
    新华社7日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会6日上午结束了本届会议的一般性辩论。在大会上发言的有伊拉克、英国和印度等国家的代表。
    印度代表梅农在发言中说，印度对日本没有出席联合国大会感到遗憾，他并且表示希望蒙古人民共和国不久可以进入联合国。
    梅农还说，他认为恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位的问题仍然有待大会解决。他说：“不管我们欢喜与否，中国的合作变得日益必要了。”
    梅农接着说，印度认为，今天世界上最重要的殖民地问题是阿尔及利亚问题。“我们在阿尔及利亚问题上的目标同以前我们自己的目标一样，那就是实现那个领土的独立。”他还谈到塞浦路斯问题、西伊里安问题和果阿问题。梅农说，果阿仍然是我们领土上的一个不愉快的疙瘩。
    梅农还谈到南非联邦歧视印度血统人的问题和克什米尔问题。他说，“我们希望看到在克什米尔的侵略停止。”
    梅农在谈到裁军问题时说，我们谈论裁军问题已经有十一年之久了，而每过一年，世界的军备不是保持着原来的水平就是达到更高的水平。如果在这个问题上的主要有关国家美国和苏联能够达成某种协议，那么我们大家都将欢迎这种协议，但是如果不能那样，那么我们就应当能够开一个头。
    梅农在谈到英、法对埃及的侵略时说，这个侵略行动是经过好几个月准备的。他说，把这次侵略行动的部分目的说成是要“排除苏联在埃及的势力”，这“完全是事后想出来的”借口，因为在埃及“并没有苏联势力存在”。他还说，不能把联合国紧急部队看成是“一支未来的军队的一个核心”。梅农谈到匈牙利局势的时候说，“我们主张，匈牙利人民有权组织他们所希望的政府。我们希望外国军队撤离一切国家。”
    英国代表狄克逊在发言里力图把联合国制止英、法侵略行为的决议同干涉匈牙利内政的决议混为一谈，他说，“法治应当对大家一视同仁”。
    狄克逊硬说埃及故意阻挠运河的通航，并且说要严防中东地区
  “对苏联共产主义开放”的“危险”。狄克逊还恫吓说，如果埃及还继续通过宣传等来维护自己国家的主权，解决中东问题的工作“是不会比较顺利的”。
    狄克逊在谈到裁军问题时说：
      “就我的政府而言，我们认为任何全面的裁军计划必须分阶段进行，并且必须同解决重要的政治问题联系起来。”
    伊拉克代表贾马利在发言里指责了犹太复国主义，他认为这是中东不安的根源，是西方殖民主义者想要“在中东建立一个桥头堡”。
    一般性辩论在当地时间下午一时五十九分结束。
