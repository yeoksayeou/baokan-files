Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 29th: The minority peoples of Qinghai Province have actively supported the resource exploration work carried out this year in the Qaidam and Tanggula Mountain regions.
    In the Lesser Tanggula Mountain region, which is covered in snow year-round, local Tibetan people warmly received the field exploration personnel. When they learned that sufficient underground resources had been found to establish factories or mines, many came to act as translators and guides, and some even participated in trench exploration work. In these areas where transportation is extremely difficult, this year Tibetan people supplied the exploration personnel with more than 360 strong yaks and horses, and also transported tens of thousands of catties of cow dung from far away for the exploration personnel to use as fuel. Once, the members of Geological Team 636 of the Ministry of Geology were unable to transport coal due to heavy snow and were about to run out of fuel, but fortunately, a Tibetan elder named Su Yi led his son with yaks carrying cow dung, so they had fuel to burn. They still remember the care of this Tibetan.
    More than 40 of the Kazakh people living in Golmud, Qaidam Basin, this year served as guides and translators for those seeking treasures in Qaidam. Their hundreds of camels often transported water and food, and equipment for the field exploration teams.
    In the remote and formerly uninhabited areas such as Kumukuli and the Qilian Mountains, the minority peoples also helped the exploration teams repair many roads that could temporarily allow vehicles to pass. They also often hunted wild cattle and wild sheep to help the exploration team improve their meals. In a geological team in Kumukuli, a herd of wild cattle once surrounded them, and Mongolian youth Namusilin and Uyghur Soluotan came with guns to drive away the herd of wild cattle, allowing the geological team to pass through the area safely.
    This year, new mineral deposits have been discovered in areas such as the Lesser Tanggula Mountain, Kumukuli, and the Qilian Mountains. Many of these mineral deposits were reported by the minority peoples. The CPC Lesser Tanggula Mountain Working Committee gave material rewards to the Tibetan people who actively supported the exploration work.

### 青海少数民族人民热情支援勘探工作

    青海少数民族人民热情支援勘探工作
    新华社西宁29日电　青海省少数民族人民积极支援了今年在柴达木、唐古拉山地区的资源勘探工作。
    在终年积雪的小唐古拉山地区，当地藏民们热情接待了野外勘探人员。当他们知道找到了足够的地下资源可以建立工厂或矿山的时候，许多人前来当翻译和向导，有的还参加了槽探工作。在这些交通极为困难的地区，今年藏民们给勘探人员供应了三百六十多头健壮的牦牛、马匹，还从很远的地方把几万斤牛粪送给勘探人员做燃料。有一次，地质部六三六队的队员因为落大雪不能运煤，眼看就要断炊，幸亏藏民苏益老汉领着他的儿子赶着驮牛粪的牦牛来了，才使他们有了烧的。他们至今仍怀念着这位藏民的关怀。
    居住在柴达木盆地格尔穆的哈萨克族人民，今年有四十多人给在柴达木找寻宝藏的人担任了向导、翻译。他们的几百峰骆驼经常为野外勘探队运水送粮，搬运器材。
    在库木库里、祁连山等过去荒无人烟的边远地区，少数民族人民还帮助勘探队检修了许多可以临时通行车辆的道路。他们还经常打来野牛、野羊，帮勘探队员改善伙食。在库木库里的一个地质队，有一次被野牛群围住了，蒙古族青年那木司林和维吾尔族的索络谭，持枪赶来驱走了野牛群，使地质队安全地通过这个地区。
    今年在小唐古拉山、库木库里、祁连山等地都发现了新的矿藏。这些矿藏中有不少是少数民族人民报告的。中共小唐古拉山工作委员会对支援勘探工作积极的藏族人民，给予了物质奖励。
