　　Preparedness Prevents Calamities
　　One of the important reasons why some good things are not done well and some correct policies are implemented incorrectly is the lack of prior preparation.
　　Opening up the free market under the leadership of the state is undoubtedly the correct measure; its effect is already obvious. Of course, due to lack of experience, some deviations have occurred in some places. However, wherever preparations are made in advance, the deviations are relatively small; where less preparation is made in advance, the deviations are relatively large.
　　The opening of the free market for Mao bamboo in Qingyuan County, Guangdong, caused serious adverse consequences because the scope, steps, and methods of opening up were not carefully studied in advance, and no policy publicity or ideological education work was carried out.
　　Shaanxi Province took some necessary steps before opening the free market, convened a meeting of small merchants and peddlers, told them what they should do, inspired them to discuss what they should do, and explained and studied relevant policy issues and specific issues. It is believable that this will lead to better results.

    有备无患
    有些好事没有做好，有些正确的政策执行歪了，重要原因之一是事先没有做好准备工作。
    开放国家领导下的自由市场，无疑是正确的措施；它的效果已经是显而易见的了。固然，由于缺乏经验，有些地方出了一些偏差。可是，凡是事先做好了准备工作的，出的偏差就比较小；事先准备工作做得少的，出的偏差就比较多。
    广东清远县开放毛竹自由市场引起了严重的恶果，就是因为事先没有认真研究开放的范围、步骤、方法，没有进行政策宣传和思想教育工作。
    陕西省在开放自由市场之前采取了一些必要的步骤，召开了小商小贩代表会议，告诉小商小贩应该怎么办，启发他们自己讨论应该怎么办，对有关的政策问题和具体问题都作了说明和研究。可以相信，这样做就会有比较好的结果。
