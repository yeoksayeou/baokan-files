    ·Mongolia·
    Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, December 15th: One of the most pleasing events for the Mongolian people in the year drawing to a close is the great achievement of animal husbandry in the Mongolian People's Republic. The number of livestock, the main national wealth of the Republic, has increased by more than 1.3 million head compared to last year. Such a rapid increase in livestock numbers is unprecedented in post-war Mongolia.
    The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Republic's government have taken a series of measures to increase herders' material interest in increasing livestock numbers. The state quota for purchasing meat has been reduced. The purchase and requisition prices for wool, meat, and milk have been greatly increased. The prices of some consumer goods have been reduced several times.
    There is a growing tendency towards collective labor among herders. There are now about 600 livestock cooperatives nationwide, one and a half times more than at the end of last year, with 22% of herding households participating in cooperatives. It is worth noting that the number of livestock, including young livestock, in cooperatives has increased by 18.2%, while in individual herding households, it has only increased by 4.5%. Therefore, animal husbandry consistently maintains the highest level in cooperatives.
    ·Poland·
    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 25th: According to the Polish Press Agency, some national economic departments and production enterprises in Poland have completed their 1956 production plans ahead of schedule.
    Four iron mines, the Lenin Metallurgical Combine, the Peace Steel Plant, and the Kasprzak and Luxembourg factories in Warsaw have already completed their annual plans.
    Enterprises under the Ministry of Forestry and Timber Industry completed their annual production plans a few days ago.
    The petroleum industry has completed its annual plans ahead of schedule in terms of petroleum and natural gas production, oil refining, and the production of drilling machinery and equipment. Their over-planned production this year will reach a value of over 80 million zlotys.
    The Consumer Cooperative Alliance, with 2,018,000 stores participating, announced that each cooperative had completed its 1956 goods sales plan on December 22nd.
    ·Bulgaria·
    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, December 24th: According to TASS, many industrial enterprises and some industrial sectors in Bulgaria have completed their 1956 production plans ahead of schedule.
    The light industry and food industry completed this year's plan eleven days ahead of schedule. This year, Bulgaria will obtain 14,510,000 meters more textiles, 42,500 tons more sugar, 4,600 tons more vegetable oil, and 7,700 tons more macaroni products than last year.
    The industry in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, completed this year's plan on December 20th. The national railway system has also fully completed its transportation plan. The penicillin factory completed its plan ahead of schedule and saved the country more than 5 million leva.

    人民民主国家的企业纷纷提前完成年度计划
    ·蒙古·
    据新华社讯　塔斯社乌兰巴托15日讯：行将结束的一年中最令蒙古人民感到愉快的一件事就是蒙古人民共和国畜牧业取得了巨大成就。共和国主要的国家财富——牲畜的头数比去年增加了一百三十多万头。牲畜头数增加这样快是战后蒙古从来未有过的。
    蒙古人民革命党和共和国政府方面采取了一系列的措施，提高牧民对增加牲畜头数的物质兴趣。国家征购肉类的定额减少了。收购和征购羊毛、肉类和牛奶的价格大大地提高了。某些消费品的价格却降低了几倍。
    在牧民中间可以看出越来越倾向于集体劳动。现在全国已经有六百来个畜牧合作社，比去年年底多一倍半，22％的牧户参加了合作社。值得注意的是，在合作社中，包括幼畜在内的牲畜头数已经增加了18.2％，然而在个体牧民户中一共只增加了4.5％。因此，畜牧业在合作社中一贯保持最高的水平。
    ·波兰·
    据新华社华沙25日电　据波兰通讯社报道，波兰一些国民经济部门和生产企业提前完成了1956年的生产计划。
    有四个铁矿、列宁冶金联合企业、和平钢铁厂、华沙的卡斯普扎克和卢森堡工厂等都已经完成了年度计划。
    林业和木材工业部所属的企业已在几天以前完成年度生产计划。
    石油工业在石油和天然瓦斯生产、炼油以及钻探机器设备的生产等方面都提前完成了年度计划。它们今年的超计划生产价值将达到八千万兹罗提以上。
    有二百零一万八千个商店参加的消费合作社联盟宣布，各个合作社已经在12月22日完成了1956年的货物销售计划。
    ·保加利亚·
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社索非亚24日讯：保加利亚的许多工业企业和某些工业部门已经提前完成了1956年的生产计划。
    轻工业和食品工业提前十一天完成了今年的计划。今年保加利亚得到的纺织品将比去年多一千四百五十一万公尺，糖将增加四万二千五百吨，植物油将增加四千六百多吨，通心粉制品将增加七千七百多吨。
    保加利亚首都索非亚的工业在12月20日就完成了今年的计划。全国的铁路系统也已经全面完成了运输计划。青霉素工厂提前完成了计划，并为国家节约了五百多万列弗（保币名）。
