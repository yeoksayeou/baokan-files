Why Do They Hate Nasser So Much?
    Yeying
    After the Egyptian government announced the recovery of the Suez Canal Company, the colonialists launched a frantic counterattack and death throes. They shot all their poisoned arrows at President Nasser, making the most shameless personal attacks on the leader of the Egyptian people.
    British Prime Minister Eden, Foreign Secretary Lloyd, French Prime Minister Mollet, Foreign Minister Pineau, and some so-called political commentators in the United States, described President Nasser as a "tyrant," a "petty dictator," called his book "Philosophy of the Revolution" "Mein Kampf" (by Hitler), and called his nationalist ideas "Arab imperialism." They gnashed their teeth and hated him to the bone, as if they had an irreconcilable feud with President Nasser.
    What is the reason why these British Conservative gentlemen and French Socialist gentlemen hate President Nasser so much?
    The reason can be found in the book "Philosophy of the Revolution."
    In this book, Nasser tells his comrades and the Egyptian people that in this region, there is only one enemy, and that is imperialism. "Imperialism is the most powerful force that forcibly sets up a bloodless encirclement in this entire region."
    In this book, Nasser tells his comrades and the Egyptian people that the revolutionary forces have three main sources: the first source is the national group formed by the Arab countries; the second source is the important strategic position of the Arab countries; and the third source is the oil reserves, which rank first in the world.
    In this book, Nasser also tells his comrades and the Egyptian people that Egypt's revolutionary actions must not only consider the "Arab circle," but also the "African continent circle." The Egyptian people "cannot stand idly by" the fate of 200 million African people.
    To have Arab countries strive for political independence and not allow imperialism to control this important strategic region. To have Arab countries strive for economic autonomy and not allow foreign capitalists to plunder a barrel of oil for only a dime. To have Arab countries unite and have African people break through the darkness.
    The central idea of Nasser's "Philosophy of the Revolution" is to make the Arab nation recognize its goals, concentrate all its strength, and drive the common enemy—the forces of imperialism—out of the entire region. In other words, it is to have the Arab and African people eliminate colonialism on their own territory.
    More importantly, this idea has been put into action and is increasingly shaking the foundations of colonial rule.
    Therefore, the die-hards of the "Suez Group," the plunderers of Middle Eastern oil, the executioners of the "Dark Continent," and all kinds of imperialist masters, tore off their masks and vowed: "The Nasser regime must fall!" They rely on fleets and airplanes; they also rely on lies and slander.
    However, things went against their wishes. The result is very clear to everyone. Those menacing "gentlemen" and "ladies," not long ago, some were "overly tired" and some were "listless." They "lost face and prestige" all over the world and have become objects of ridicule and hatred.
    As for President Nasser and the Egyptian government, according to the evaluation made by the spokesperson of the Conservative government's "respectable opposition party": they have already "won a great political victory."
    The stupidity of the imperialist masters lies in the fact that they only see individuals and not the people; they only believe in force, but do not understand that there are things more powerful than force.

    他们为什么这样痛恨纳赛尔？
    椰影
    埃及政府宣布收回苏伊士运河公司后，殖民主义者进行疯狂的反扑和垂死的挣扎。他们把一切毒箭都射向纳赛尔总统，对埃及人民的领袖进行最无耻的人身攻击。
    英国的艾登首相、劳埃德外相，法国的摩勒总理、比诺外长，还有美国的一些所谓政论家，把纳赛尔总统说成是“暴君”、“小独裁者”，把他的著作“革命哲学”称为“我的奋斗”（希特勒作），把他的民族主义思想称为“阿拉伯帝国主义”。他们咬牙切齿，恨之入骨，仿佛同纳赛尔总统有不共戴天之仇。
    这些英国保守党的绅士们和法国社会党的先生们这样痛恨纳赛尔总统，究竟是什么道理呢？
    道理可以从“革命哲学”一书里找到。
    纳赛尔在这本书里告诉他的战友和埃及人民，在这个地区内，敌人只有一个，就是帝国主义。“帝国主义是在这整个地区强行设下杀人不见血的包围圈的最强大的势力。”
    纳赛尔在这本书里告诉他的战友和埃及人民，革命的力量有三个主要的来源：第一个来源是阿拉伯国家形成的一个民族集团；第二个来源是阿拉伯国家所处的重要战略地位；第三个来源是蕴藏量占全世界第一位的石油。
    纳赛尔在这本书里还告诉他的战友和埃及人民，埃及的革命行动不仅要考虑到“阿拉伯的圈子”，还要考虑到“非洲大陆的圈子”。埃及人民对两亿非洲人民的命运“不能袖手旁观”。
    要阿拉伯国家争取政治上的独立，不让帝国主义控制这个重要战略地区。要阿拉伯国家争取经济上的自主，不让外国资本家只花一角钱就掠去一桶石油。要阿拉伯国家团结起来，要非洲人民冲破黑暗。
    纳赛尔的“革命哲学”的中心思想，就是要阿拉伯民族认清目标，集中一切力量，把共同的敌人——帝国主义势力赶出整个地区。换一句话说，就是要阿拉伯人民和非洲人民在自己的领土上，消灭殖民主义。
    更重要的，这种思想已经见诸行动，而且正在越来越强烈地震撼着殖民统治的根基。
    于是，“苏伊士集团”的死硬分子们，中东石油的掠夺者们，“黑暗大陆”的刽子手们，各式各样的帝国主义老爷们，撕破了自己的面具，赌咒罚誓：“要纳赛尔政权垮台！”他们依仗舰队和飞机；他们也依仗谎言和污蔑。
    但是，事与愿违。结果是大家已经看得很清楚的。那些声势汹汹的“绅士们”和“先生们”，曾几何时，有人是“过度疲劳”了，有人是“有气无力”了。他们在全世界“失去了面子和威望”，已经成为被嘲笑和憎恶的对象了。
    而纳赛尔总统和埃及政府呢，据保守党政府的“可尊敬的反对党”的发言人所作的评价是：已经“赢得了巨大的政治胜利”。
    帝国主义老爷们的愚蠢，就在于他们只看到个人，而没有看到人民；只相信武力，而不懂得比这更加有力的东西。
