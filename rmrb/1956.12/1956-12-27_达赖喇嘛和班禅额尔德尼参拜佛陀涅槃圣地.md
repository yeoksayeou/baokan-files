Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 26th: The Dalai Lama, Panchen Erdeni, and their entourage offered prayers at Kushinagar, the holy site of Buddha's Nirvana, on the morning of the 25th.

    In a temple enshrining a giant reclining Buddha, the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni piously worshipped the Buddha. They lit candles, burned incense, placed the incense around the Buddha statue, covered the Buddha statue with yellow satin, and offered hadas and flowers. Then, they prayed and read scriptures. Many of their entourage piously touched the Buddha statue with their heads.

    After the prayers, they visited the Ramabhar Stupa, the site of the cremation of the Buddha's body. They toured the surroundings of the stupa and then returned to the temple to pray again. In the afternoon, the Dalai Lama brushed gold powder all over the Buddha statue.

    Kushinagar is thirty-five miles from Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh. It is an ancient city, but now desolate and uninhabited. Faxian and Xuanzang visited this place and saw this once important place turned into ruins. Now, part of the ruins has been exposed due to excavation.

    Before visiting this place, the Kushinagar Buddhist Academy held a grand welcome meeting for the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni. Approximately one thousand local dignitaries and students attended the welcome meeting. Among them were several Chinese monks who had gone there many years ago. At the welcome meeting, the Dalai Lama praised the contributions made by Buddhist believers and the Indian government in preserving this historical site. He asked Buddhists to practice the Buddha's teachings to benefit all living beings. Panchen Erdeni called on all Buddhists to strive for peace, and he hoped that all countries in the world would abide by the Five Principles advocated by India and China.

    Local dignitary Sardar invited the Dalai Lama, Panchen Erdeni, and all the personnel to lunch. In the evening, the guests attended a reception held by Gorakhpur Commissioner Bagchi, attended by fifteen hundred people. At the meeting, local amateur artists performed artistic programs, including many beautiful dances depicting religious stories.

    The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni arrived in Gorakhpur on the morning of the 25th. They were welcomed by local officials, local celebrities, and thousands of people.

    Before leaving Benares on the evening of the 24th, the Dalai Lama preached Buddhist doctrines for three hours at a gathering of five thousand people.
