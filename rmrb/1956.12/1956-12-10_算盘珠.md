    "Abacus Beads"
    Some cadres are like "abacus beads"; the leadership moves them, and only then do they move.
    On October 20th of this year, the Party Committee of the Shimensi Cotton Factory in Shimian County, Sichuan, was still giving Party lectures to cadres according to the 1945 Party Constitution. The masses asked: Why not lecture according to the new Party Constitution? The lecturer replied: "The higher Party Committee has not yet notified us."

    “算盘珠”
    有些干部好像是“算盘珠”，领导上拨一下，他才动一下。
    今年10月20日，四川石棉县石棉厂党委会仍然依照1945年的党章给干部上党课。群众提出：为什么不按新党章讲课呢？主讲人回答说：“上级党委尚未通知。”
