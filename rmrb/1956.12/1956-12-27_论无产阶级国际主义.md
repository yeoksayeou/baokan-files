On Proletarian Internationalism
Soviet Union, A. Azizyan

I cannot agree with the definition of proletarian internationalism in Bibrowski's article published in the Warsaw "New Culture Newspaper."

The principle of proletarian internationalism has increasingly urgent practical significance at present. The principle of proletarian internationalism is the foundation of the mutual relations between communist parties and socialist countries. Based on the experience of the struggle for socialism, a correct understanding of these principles in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism is helpful for the closer unity of the working people. The political commentator Bibrowski published an article in the Warsaw "New Culture Newspaper," requesting "Pravda" to clarify the issue of proletarian internationalism, which is indeed very important. At the same time, the author felt it necessary to give his own definition of internationalism, which we quote below:

Bibrowski wrote: "The meaning of socialist internationalism today is to consolidate the correct relations between the communist parties, workers' parties, and socialist countries, to consolidate relations based on the principle of coexistence without any hegemonic tendencies, and at the same time to fight against Stalinism, against the old structures of conservatism and reactionary forces through free and friendly discussions, and to fight for the revival of the democratic workers' movement."

We must immediately point out that we cannot agree with this definition, because this definition lacks the main elements that Marxism-Leninism gives to the concept of proletarian internationalism. In addition, there are many incorrect points in this definition.

"Workers of all countries, unite!" This battle cry has always expressed the interests of the working class. The international solidarity and unity of the working people of the world is a fighting weapon to fight against international reactionary forces. When Marxists talk about proletarian internationalism, they will first think of the fighting revolutionary call made by Marx and Engels more than a hundred years ago: "Workers of all countries, unite!" This fighting slogan has always expressed the fundamental interests of the working class, whose historical mission is to unite on an international scale in order to transform capitalist society into socialist society by revolutionary means. The reason why this well-known truth is repeated is because some people are beginning to forget that building communism is our main goal, and the proletariat and workers all over the world should unite their forces for this.

Regrettably, the definition listed in "New Culture Newspaper" lacks this basic principle of proletarian internationalism. The fact that this slogan is not mentioned at all is obviously not accidental. Bibrowski's article echoes the article published by the writer Florczak in the same newspaper in October this year. Florczak's article tried to prove that the slogan "Workers of all countries, unite!" seems to be outdated. It goes without saying that Marxists-Leninists cannot agree with such arguments. The greater the achievements of the working people of various countries in the struggle for socialism, the more possible and urgently necessary it is to strengthen their international solidarity and unity. As everyone knows, under the current circumstances, the imperialist reactionary forces are doing everything possible to create disputes between the communist parties of various countries, to sow discord among the socialist countries, and to divide the forces of the people of various countries who oppose colonialism, in order to oppose the working people, the socialist countries, and the national liberation movements of the people of various countries. In order to fight against international reactionary forces, the working people have a long-tested fighting weapon, which is the international solidarity and unity of the working people of the world. Today, the fighting slogan of the working class "Workers of all countries, unite!" appears more urgent and realistic than it did a hundred years ago.

Under the conditions of the overall rule of capitalism, the working people particularly need the rock-solid unity of the working class and the international solidarity of the proletariat in order to fight for liberation from exploitation and oppression. After the working people of one country have overthrown capitalism and established the power of the working people, and many other countries have followed this path one after another, the principle of proletarian internationalism has greater strength and significance, showing its great creative role in building a new socialist life. The working people of various capitalist countries continue to struggle against capitalist oppression under the banner of proletarian internationalism. The struggle for liberation by the working people of colonial and dependent countries is unfolding under the banner of internationalism. The people of socialist countries are building socialism under the banner of internationalism, giving each other fraternal help, and using common efforts to defend the achievements of socialism and prevent the conspiracies of the imperialists. The strength and power of the socialist camp is constantly increasing due to the growing support of the working people all over the world.

Mutual support among the working people of various countries is a vivid manifestation of proletarian internationalism. In order for socialism to achieve victory, proletarian internationalism should be supported by the working masses of all countries (including the colonial people) and maintained by the socialist countries.

Mutual support among the working people of various countries is a vivid manifestation of proletarian internationalism. There was a time when the Soviet Union was the only socialist country. At that time, Lenin wrote:

"... At present, we cannot limit ourselves to empty acknowledgments or empty advocacy of the close relationship between the working masses of all nationalities, but must carry out such a policy, so that the close alliance between all national liberation movements and colonial liberation movements and Soviet Russia can be realized, and the form of this alliance should be determined according to the degree of development of the communist movement in the proletariat of each country, or according to the degree of development of the bourgeois democratic liberation movement of workers and peasants in backward countries or backward nationalities."

Now, the power of many countries in Europe and Asia has been transferred to the hands of the working people, and the Soviet Union is no longer alone. However, Lenin's words are still relevant today, and are fully applicable to the entire socialist camp. If the purpose of proletarian internationalism is to enable socialism to achieve victory and obtain consolidation, then, in all corners of the world, does not the proletarian internationalist policy also mean that the working masses of all countries support and defend the countries that have embarked on the path of socialist development? Therefore, we can certainly say that supporting the people's democratic Poland that is advancing along the socialist road is a necessary component of the proletarian internationalist policy.

The ideas of patriotism and internationalism are organically combined in the revolutionary struggles of the working people of various countries. Comrade Thorez wrote: "People's patriotism is manifested in regarding the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries as fortresses that the international proletariat should defend. Is not the existence of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, as the pillars of the international workers' movement, the best guarantee of peace and independence for all countries? It is the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries that embody this hope: the principle of respecting the rights of every country and the friendship of the people of all countries will triumph in international relations."

When Bibrowski defined proletarian internationalism, he ignored another extremely important factor - the solidarity between the class struggle of the proletariat and the anti-imperialist national liberation movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries. The proletariat fully supports the liberation struggles of the oppressed nations in colonial and semi-colonial countries, and forms a united front with them to fight against the common enemy of imperialism, and fights for the complete elimination of colonialism.

The bourgeoisie uses the strategy of "divide and rule," uses national sentiment to speculate, and attempts to split the international solidarity of the proletariat. The revolutionary characteristics of international solidarity are: opposing the bourgeoisie, opposing reformism and nationalism; striving for socialism and democracy; eliminating colonialism, and striving for the victory of national liberation movements.

The bourgeoisie, seeing the growing strength of the international solidarity of the proletariat, attempts to split their solidarity. One of the methods used by the imperialists to create divisions is to use national sentiments to speculate. The insidious policy of the warmongering bourgeoisie takes "divide and rule!" as its motto. The imperialist ideologues use the method of inciting national egoism and encouraging national uniqueness to try to create quarrels in the ranks of the people of various countries who are fighting for liberation, democracy, and socialism.

Lenin pointed out that even among communists, it is not difficult to encounter the characteristics peculiar to the parties of the Second International - nominally acknowledging internationalism, but actually secretly replacing it with vulgar nationalism. Such communists reduce internationalism to only the equality of the people of various countries, ignoring another most important aspect - the unanimity of the people of various equal countries, their unity for the struggle for socialism and against capitalism. In his famous work "Draft Theses on National and Colonial Questions," Lenin believed that the primary point of implementing an internationalist policy is to expose all the lies and hypocrisy of bourgeois politicians, especially the lies and hypocrisy on national issues. Lenin emphasized that the bourgeoisie's democracy's proposition on the entire issue of equality, including national equality, is abstract and formalized. The true equality of the people of all countries can only be established on the basis of thorough democracy. Leninism teaches that in the struggle for the equality of the people of all countries, we must always proceed from the interests of the working masses and from the interests of socialism. Therefore, opposing the distortion of proletarian internationalism from a nationalistic perspective is an important condition for carrying out a genuine struggle for socialism, freedom, and national equality.

Lenin relentlessly exposed the reformists, who said they were internationalists in words, but betrayed socialism and sabotaged the revolutionary solidarity of the workers of various countries in action. The above-mentioned article in "New Culture Newspaper" does not mention opposing the bourgeoisie's nationalism and reformist ideology at all. It does not take into account the directive issued by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party on the need to resolutely fight against attempts to provoke nationalistic sentiments.

The author of the article in "New Culture Newspaper" wrote that there must be correct relations between the communist parties, the workers' parties, and the socialist countries. This point is of course indisputable. However, we absolutely cannot agree with his definition of the "foundation" on which to consolidate this relationship: according to the author, socialist Internationalism should be built on the basis of fighting against "Stalinism."

First of all, it must be pointed out that we do not know of the doctrine of "Stalinism." All those who are well-versed in Marxism-Leninism should understand that Stalin did not leave any special doctrine. He was a great Marxist and his activities were guided by the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism. His contribution to the revolutionary movement is well known. Everyone also knows that he made serious theoretical and practical mistakes on a series of issues, but these mistakes did not create any special faction of Marxism-Leninism. The essence of these mistakes and their harmful consequences have been bravely criticized to the world by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in many documents, which are well known to everyone. We are fighting against the evil consequences of the personality cult of Stalin, and we will continue to carry out this struggle in the future. The imperialist reactionaries pretend to fight against so-called "Stalinism" and launch attacks on the sacred wealth of the working class, on its revolutionary worldview - Marxism-Leninism and the achievements of socialist countries.

Thus, it is very obvious that the definition of proletarian internationalism given in "New Culture Newspaper" loses its most important revolutionary characteristics: struggling against the bourgeoisie, against reformism and nationalism, striving for socialism and democracy, striving for the victory of the national liberation movements of all nations and the elimination of colonialism.

The relationship between communist parties cannot be the sum of some parties that go their own way. They have a common Marxist-Leninist worldview, a common ideal of building socialism, and are faithfully linked together for the interests of the working people.

When talking about the necessary correct relationship between fraternal parties, the author places the emphasis on the principle that they should "coexist." This formulation of the problem cannot but arouse the aversion of communists. If this refers to the coexistence of countries with different social systems and different political systems, then it can be understood. However, this refers to communist parties that have a consistent Marxist-Leninist worldview and are linked together by the common ideal of building socialism and loyalty to the interests of the working people. If the relationship between communist parties is established according to the method suggested in "New Culture Newspaper," then what will be obtained will not be a solid front of revolutionary forces linked together by a consistent worldview, conscious discipline, mutually voluntarily undertaken obligations, and common goals, but the sum of some parties that go their own way. In this way, where is the internationalist responsibility, where is the idea of mutual support and assistance built on the basis of mutual respect? No, this is not the kind of internationalism that Marxism-Leninism teaches us, nor is it the kind of internationalism that the communist party is following.

In this regard, it is helpful to recall the remarks made by Comrade Palmiro Togliatti on the issues we are talking about. He said:

"... When the working class has seized power and established its own country, proletarian internationalism is not just a general call for the strength of organized parties and the masses of working people, it should take all necessary measures to organize and defend this country... Now there are many socialist countries in existence, and we should understand internationalist solidarity as being in solidarity with all these countries and their governments. We know that each country should follow its own path, but we also know that they are all in unison, and we should be with them, because these countries are not fighting for domination, not for implementing exploitation, but for building a new socialist world."

The views of the political commentators who published articles in "New Culture Newspaper" on proletarian internationalism are not limited to them. Some other foreign authors' incorrect discussions about proletarian internationalism echo their remarks. For example, there is such an argument: since cooperation of all countries should be organized, there is no need to "just" carry out cooperation between socialist countries; the willingness of socialist countries to unite to solve common tasks is said to be a kind of sectarianism that will weaken socialist forces.

It cannot but be seen that it is incorrect to raise this question in this way. Does anyone now raise this question: socialist countries are limited to carrying out cooperation among themselves? Who does not know that while socialist countries are cooperating closely with each other, they also make every effort to establish friendly relations with all countries and arrange business cooperation with them?

Everyone knows that the people of socialist countries, who are united by consistent goals and consistent worldviews, are personally related to genuine fraternal cooperation. The more their unity, cooperation, and mutual assistance are strengthened, the more confident and faster they will move towards the common goal of communism. Conversely, the less tight their unity is, the easier it is for the reactionary forces to defeat the socialist countries one by one.

The correct relationship between socialist countries should be established on the principle of proletarian internationalism. When arranging friendly cooperation, national factors should be valued, and everything precious accumulated by each country in the process of building socialism should be used. Life requires close and firm unity among socialist countries. The correct relationship between them can and should be established on the principle of proletarian internationalism.

Every country has its own traditions and customs, its own national wealth, and deeply rooted feelings of national honor and national dignity. When arranging friendly cooperation among socialist countries on the basis of the principle of proletarian internationalism, national factors should be valued and should be considered mutually. Therefore, the more consistently socialist countries follow the Leninist principles of equality and mutual respect, the stronger the friendship between the people of these countries.

Starting from this point, the 20th Party Congress criticized the shortcomings in the mutual relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, resolutely denounced the errors in this regard, and put forward the task of the Soviet Union consistently implementing the Leninist principle of equality among countries in its mutual relations with other socialist countries.

The declaration issued by the Soviet government on October 30, 1956, on the basis for developing and further strengthening friendship and cooperation between the USSR and other socialist countries, developed the line formulated by the 20th Congress of the CPSU and specified the task of further strengthening the friendship between socialist countries. This Leninist line has been reflected in the joint statements of the Soviet-Polish talks and the Soviet-Romanian talks.

The countries in the big family of socialist countries, which are united by the common ideal of building a socialist society and the principles of proletarian internationalism, establish their mutual relations on the principle of complete equality. This principle requires respecting the territorial integrity, national independence, and sovereignty of each country, as well as non-interference in internal affairs. This not only does not exclude close fraternal cooperation and mutual assistance among socialist countries in the economic, political, and cultural fields, but is a prerequisite for them.

Socialist countries exchange experiences with each other, and use everything of value accumulated by each country in the process of socialist construction in accordance with the characteristics of their own country. The whole world knows that the Soviet Union has consistently implemented the internationalist policy of socialism, helping the People's Democratic countries build many enterprises, and giving them loans on favorable terms.

Economic cooperation between socialist countries is constantly developing on the basis of complete equality and mutual benefit. This cooperation is subordinate to the tasks of increasing productivity, doing everything possible to improve the welfare of the people, and consolidating the socialist system. The political ties, cultural ties, and spiritual exchanges between the countries of the socialist camp are increasingly developing and consolidating.

Socialist countries have consistently eliminated everything that violates the principles of proletarian internationalism, even in the smallest degree, in their mutual relations.

The joint statement issued by the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia a few days ago approved the Soviet Union's actions in Hungary, and emphasized that the victory over the counter-revolution made it possible for the Hungarian working people to continue to build socialism in a free, independent, and democratic country under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party. The statement emphasized that the Hungarian people can receive the full support and assistance of the people of Germany and Czechoslovakia.

The joint statement pointed out that the world socialist system can only be consolidated on the basis of the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, which is resolutely defended by the two parties. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia resolutely reject any attempt to propose other programs for the communist movement. The statement said that all unfounded "national communism" remarks are contrary to Marxism-Leninism. The two parties emphasized the necessity of the unity of the entire world communist movement, and the necessity of carrying out a common struggle against imperialist provocative actions and the anti-socialist words and deeds of various opportunists and traitors to the workers' movement.

It should be pointed out that the leading bodies of the Polish United Workers' Party and the party's newspapers and periodicals oppose anti-socialist remarks and call for strengthening friendship and cooperation among socialist countries.

Imperialist reactionaries are trying to realize their plans to attack democratic forces and socialist forces. The powerful and reliable method for the working people to oppose this plan is to unite more closely under the banner of proletarian internationalism.

The imperialists' attempts to create estrangement among socialist countries have failed. The countries of the socialist camp are holding high the banner of proletarian internationalism, and showing the great vitality of the principles of socialist internationalism with friendship and cooperation.

The past year has been a year of new upsurge in the strength of the international communist movement. In 1956, the largest communist parties in the Soviet Union, China, France, and Italy held congresses. Representatives of the communist parties of most countries attended these congresses as guests. These congresses show that the fraternal ties between the communist parties of various countries have been greatly expanded and strengthened on the basis of Marxism-Leninism.

The proletarian internationalist policy, which has become the leading principle of mutual relations among socialist countries, shows enormous and constantly progressing vitality.

When Comrade Mao Zedong spoke of the growth of socialist strength, he wrote: "Now the Soviet Union has reached such strength, the Chinese people's revolution has achieved such a great victory, the construction of the people's democratic countries has made such great achievements, the anti-oppression and anti-aggression movement of the people of various countries in the world has had such a high tide, and the front of our friendship and unity is so consolidated, so it can be completely asserted that we are not afraid of any imperialist aggression. Any imperialist aggression will be smashed by us, and all despicable instigations are completely useless."

The current international situation shows that imperialist reactionaries are trying to realize their premeditated plans to attack democratic forces and socialist forces. The working people have a powerful and reliable method to deal with this kind of action by imperialist reactionaries - that is, to unite more closely under the banner of proletarian internationalism.

    论无产阶级国际主义
    苏联　阿齐祥
    不能同意华沙“新文化报”上发表的比布罗夫斯基的文章中对无产阶级国际主义下的定义。
    无产阶级国际主义原则，在目前具有越来越迫切的现实意义。无产阶级国际主义原则是各国共产党和各社会主义国家相互关系的基础。根据争取社会主义的斗争的经验，本着马克思列宁主义来正确理解这些原则，对劳动人民的更紧密的团结是有帮助的。政论家比布罗夫斯基在华沙的“新文化报”上发表文章，要求“真理报”阐明确实是十分重要的无产阶级国际主义原则的问题。同时，文章的作者还觉得有必要自己给国际主义下一个定义，我们把他的话引述在下面：
    比布罗夫斯基写道：“社会主义国际主义的含义在今天就是巩固各国共产党、工人党以及各社会主义国家之间的正确关系，巩固没有任何一家独霸倾向而以共处原则为基础的关系，同时也就是通过自由、友好的讨论的途径同斯大林主义、同保守主义和反动势力的旧结构作斗争，以及为民主的革命工人运动的复兴而斗争。”
  我们要立刻指出，我们不能同意这个定义，因为这个定义缺乏马克思列宁主义赋与无产阶级国际主义这一概念的主要因素。除此以外，这个定义还有许多不正确的地方。
    “全世界无产者，联合起来！”这个战斗口号一直表达工人阶级的利益。世界各国劳动人民的国际团结和统一，是同国际反动势力作斗争的战斗武器。当马克思主义者谈到无产阶级国际主义的时候，他首先就会想起马克思和恩格斯在一百多年前提出的战斗的革命号召：“全世界无产者、联合起来！”这个战斗的口号过去和现在一直表达工人阶级的根本利益，这个阶级的历史使命是在国际规模上联合起来以求用革命手段把资本主义社会改造成为社会主义社会。这个众所周知的真理所以要重复一遍，是因为某些人开始忘记，建成共产主义是我们的主要目标，全世界的无产阶级和劳动者应该为此而联合自己的力量。
    遗憾的是，“新文化报”所列举的定义缺少无产阶级国际主义这一基本原则。对这个口号一字未提，显然不是偶然的。比布罗夫斯基的文章和今年10月作家弗洛尔恰克在同一报纸上发表的文章是相呼应的。弗洛尔恰克的文章想设法证明“全世界无产者，联合起来！”的口号好像已经过时。不言而喻，马克思列宁主义者不能同意类此的论调。各个国家的劳动人民在争取社会主义的斗争中获得的成就越大，加强他们的国际团结和统一也就越是可能，越是迫切必需。大家知道，在目前的情况下，帝国主义反动势力为了反对劳动人民，反对社会主义国家和各国人民的民族解放运动，正千方百计地企图在各国共产党之间制造纠纷，对各社会主义国家进行挑拨离间，分裂反对殖民主义的各国人民的力量。为了和国际反动势力作斗争，劳动人民有一个久经考验的战斗武器，这个武器就是世界各国劳动人民的国际团结和统一。在今天，工人阶级的战斗口号“全世界无产者，联合起来！”比一百年前显得更加迫切和现实。
    在资本主义全面统治的条件下，劳动人民为了争取摆脱剥削压迫，特别需要工人阶级磐石般的团结和无产阶级的国际团结。在一个国家的劳动人民推翻了资本主义并且建立了劳动人民的政权而其他许多国家也相继走上这条道路之后，无产阶级国际主义的原则具有更大的力量和意义，显示了它在建设社会主义新生活中的伟大的创造性作用。各资本主义国家的劳动人民在无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下继续进行反对资本压迫的斗争。殖民地附属国劳动人民在国际主义的旗帜下争取解放的斗争正在展开。各社会主义国家的人民在国际主义的旗帜下建设着社会主义，彼此给予兄弟般的帮助，并且用共同的努力保卫社会主义的成就，防止帝国主义者的阴谋。社会主义阵营的力量和威力，由于全世界劳动人民日益增长的支持而不断在增加。
    各国劳动人民的相互支持，是无产阶级国际主义的鲜明表现。为了使社会主义取得胜利，无产阶级国际主义应该得到各国劳动群众（包括殖民地人民）的支持和社会主义国家的维护。
    各国劳动人民之间的相互支持，是无产阶级国际主义的鲜明表现。曾有一个时期苏联是唯一的社会主义国家，当时列宁写道：
    “……现时不能局限于空口承认或空口提倡各民族劳动群众互相接近，而必须进行这样的政策，使一切民族解放运动和殖民地解放运动之与苏维埃俄国间的紧密联盟得以实现，根据各个国家无产阶级中共产主义运动发展的程度，或根据落后国家或落后民族中工人和农民的资产阶级民主解放运动发展的程度，来确定这一联盟的形式。”
    现在，欧洲和亚洲许多国家的政权转入了劳动人民手中，苏联不是孤独的了。但是，列宁的话在今天仍然有现实意义，而且完全适用于整个社会主义阵营。如果无产阶级国际主义的目的是使社会主义取得胜利和获得巩固，那么，在全世界一切角落里，无产阶级国际主义政策也还意味着各国劳动群众支持和保卫已经走上社会主义发展道路的国家，这不是很清楚吗？因而我们可以肯定说，支持沿着社会主义道路前进的人民民主波兰，是无产阶级国际主义政策的必要的组成因素。
    爱国主义和国际主义的思想在各国劳动人民的革命斗争中有机地结合起来。多列士同志写道：“人民爱国主义表现为，把苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家看作国际无产阶级应当保卫的堡垒。作为国际工人运动支柱的苏联和人民民主国家的存在，难道不是各国的和平和独立的最好的保证吗？正是苏联和人民民主国家体现了这种希望：尊重每一个国家的权利和各国人民友好的原则将在国际关系中获得胜利。”
    比布罗夫斯基在给无产阶级国际主义下定义的时候忽略了另一个极为重要的因素——无产者的阶级斗争和殖民地半殖民地的反帝国主义民族解放运动之间的团结一致。无产者全面支持殖民地和半殖民地被压迫民族的解放斗争，并且同他们结成统一阵线来反对共同的敌人帝国主义，为彻底消灭殖民主义而斗争。
    资产阶级使用“分而治之”的策略，利用民族感情进行投机，企图分裂无产阶级的国际团结。国际团结的革命特征就是：反对资产阶级，反对改良主义和民族主义；争取社会主义和民主；消灭殖民主义，争取民族解放运动的胜利。
    资产阶级看到无产者国际团结的日益增长的力量，企图分裂他们的团结。帝国主义者所使用的制造分歧的方法之一，就是利用民族感情进行投机。好战成性的资产阶级的阴险政策以“分而治之！”为座右铭。帝国主义的思想家用煽动民族利己主义、鼓励民族独特化的办法，企图在争取解放、民主和社会主义的各国人民的队伍里制造争吵。
    列宁指出，甚至在共产党人中间也不难遇到第二国际政党所特具的特点——口头上承认国际主义，而实际上以庸俗的民族主义偷偷地把它换掉了。这样的共产党人把国际主义缩小到只有各国人民的平等而忽略了另一个最重要的方面——各平等国家人民的一致、他们为了争取社会主义、反对资本主义的团结。　列宁在自己的名著“民族与殖民地问题提纲初稿”中认为，实行国际主义政策的首要之点是，必须揭穿资产阶级政客们的全部谎言和伪善，特别是在民族问题上的谎言和伪善。列宁强调指出，资产阶级的民主关于整个平等问题，其中也包括民族平等问题的提法是抽象的和形式化的。各国人民真正的平等只有在彻底民主的基础上才有可能建立。列宁主义教导说，在争取各国人民平等的斗争中必须始终从劳动群众的利益，从社会主义的利益出发。因此，反对从民族主义的角度来曲解无产阶级国际主义是进行真正的争取社会主义、自由和民族平权的斗争的重要条件。
    列宁曾经无情地揭露了改良主义者，他们在口头上说自己是国际主义者，而在行动上则背叛社会主义和破坏各国工人的革命团结事业。上述“新文化报”上的那篇文章一点也没有提到要反对资产阶级的民族主义和改良主义意识形态，它没有考虑到波兰统一工人党八中全会所发出的关于必需同挑起民族主义情绪的企图进行坚决斗争的指示。
    “新文化报”上的这篇文章的作者写道，各共产党、工人党之间和各社会主义国家之间必须有正确关系。这个论点当然是无可争论的。但是，绝不能同意他对那种“基础”所下的定义，他建议在这种“基础”上巩固这种关系：按照作者的意思，社会主义的国际主义应当建立在同“斯大林主义”作斗争的基础上。
    首先必须指出，我们不知道“斯大林主义”这种学说，所有通晓马克思列宁主义的人都应当明白，斯大林并没有留下什么特殊的学说。他是一位大马克思主义者并在自己的活动中是以马克思列宁主义学说为指南的。他对革命运动的贡献是大家知道的。大家也都知道，在一系列的问题上他犯了严重的理论性和实践性的错误，但是这些错误并没造成马克思列宁主义的什么特殊派别。这些错误的实质及其有害的后果已经由苏联共产党在许多文件中向全世界作了勇敢的批判，这些文件是大家都知道的。我们正在跟对斯大林的个人崇拜的恶果作斗争，并且今后还要继续进行这种斗争。而帝国主义反动分子则假装同所谓“斯大林主义”作斗争而对工人阶级的神圣财富、对它的革命世界观——马克思列宁主义和社会主义国家的成果展开了进攻。
    这样，很明显，“新文化报”给无产阶级国际主义下的定义中失去了它的最重要的革命特征：为反对资产阶级、反对改良主义和民族主义，争取社会主义和民主，争取各民族的民族解放运动的胜利和消灭殖民主义而斗争。
    共产党之间的关系，不能是各行其是的一些政党的总和。他们具有共同的马克思列宁主义世界观，建设社会主义的共同理想，为劳动人民的利益忠诚地联结在一起。
    在谈到兄弟党之间必需有正确的关系的时候，作者把着重点放在它们应“共处”这一原则上。问题的这种提法不能不引起共产党人的反感。假如这里说的是不同社会制度、不同政治制度的国家的共处，那便可以理解。但是，这里说的是具有一致的马克思列宁主义世界观和被建设社会主义的共同理想及对劳动人民利益的忠诚联结在一起的共产党。如果按照“新文化报”上建议的办法来建立共产党之间的关系，那么所得到必将不是一个被一致的世界观、自觉的纪律、彼此自愿承担的义务和共同的目标所联结在一起的革命力量的牢固阵线，而是各行其是的一些政党的总和。这样一来，国际主义的责任在哪里，建筑在互相尊重基础上的互相支持和帮助的思想在哪里呢？不，马克思列宁主义所教导我们的不是这样的国际主义，而共产党正在遵行的也不是这样的国际主义。
    在这方面，回忆一下帕尔米罗·陶里亚蒂同志就我们所谈的问题发表的言论是有好处的，他说：
    “……当工人阶级掌握政权，并且建立自己的国家的时候，无产阶级国际主义不仅仅是一般地号召有组织的党的力量和劳动人民群众，它应当采取一切必要的措施来组织和保卫这个国家……现在有许多社会主义国家存在，我们应当把国际主义团结理解成同所有这些国家和它们的政府的团结一致。我们知道，每个国家应当走它自己的道路，然而我们也还知道，它们全都是一致的，我们应当同它们在一起，因为这些国家不是为争夺统治，不是为实行剥削，而是为建立社会主义新世界而斗争的”。
    在“新文化报”上发表文章的政论家们关于无产阶级国际主义的那种见解并不只限于他们。其他一些外国作者关于无产阶级国际主义的不正确的议论同他们的言论相呼应。比如，有这样一种议论：既然应该组织一切国家的合作，就没有必要“只是”在社会主义国家之间实行合作；社会主义国家要求团结起来解决共同任务的意愿据说是一种会削弱社会主义力量的宗派主义。
    不能不看到，这样提出问题是不正确的。难道，有谁现在提出这样问题：社会主义国家仅限于自己之间进行合作？谁不知道社会主义国家在密切相互合作的同时，还尽一切努力来同所有国家建立友好关系，同它们安排事务合作呢？
    大家都知道，被一致的目的、一致的世界观团结在一起的社会主义国家人民对真正的兄弟合作是切身相关的。他们之间的团结、合作和互助越加增强，他们走向共同目标——共产主义就越加有信心、越加迅速。相反地，他们的团结越不紧密，反动势力越容易各个击破社会主义国家。
    社会主义国家间的正确关系应该建立在无产阶级国际主义原则上。在安排友好合作时，民族因素应受到重视，要利用每一个国家在建设社会主义过程中积累起来的所有珍贵的东西。生活要求社会主义国家之间密切和牢固的团结一致。它们之间的正确关系能够，而且应该建立在无产阶级国际主义的原则上。
    每一个国家都有自己的传统和习俗、自己的民族财富、根源深厚的民族荣誉感和民族尊严感。在无产阶级国际主义原则基础上安排社会主义国家友好的合作时，民族因素应当受到重视，应当互相考虑。因此，社会主义国家间越加一贯地遵行列宁主义的平等和互相尊重的原则，这些国家人民的友谊越加牢固。
    从这一点出发，第二十次党代表大会批评了苏联同人民民主国家相互关系中的缺点，坚决斥责了这方面的错误，提出苏联在同其他社会主义国家的相互关系中一贯实行各国平等的列宁主义原则的任务。
    苏联政府在1956年10月30日发表的关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家之间的友谊和合作的基础的宣言中发展了苏共第二十次代表大会拟定的路线，并且把进一步加强社会主义国家之间的友谊的任务具体化了。这条列宁主义的路线已经在苏波谈判和苏罗谈判的联合声明中反映出来了。
    被建设社会主义社会的共同理想和无产阶级国际主义的原则团结在一起的、社会主义国家大家庭中的国家把它们的互相关系建立在完全平等的原则上。这项原则要求尊重每一个国家的领土完整、国家独立和主权，以及互不干涉内政。这点非但不排斥社会主义国家在经济、政治和文化方面的紧密的兄弟合作和互助，并且是它们的先决条件。
    社会主义国家彼此交流经验，并且根据本国的特点来利用每一个国家在社会主义建设过程中所积累起来的所有有价值的东西。全世界都知道，苏联一贯实行社会主义的国际主义政策，帮助人民民主国家建设许许多多企业，并且给予它们条件优惠的贷款。
    社会主义国家的经济合作在完全平等和互利的基础上不断发展。这种合作从属于这样的任务：提高生产力、尽力提高人民福利、巩固社会主义制度。社会主义阵营各国间的政治联系、文化联系和精神上的交往日益发展和巩固。
    社会主义国家在自己的相互关系中始终如一地消除即使在最小程度上违背着无产阶级国际主义原则的一切东西。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会和捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会在前几天发表的联合声明赞同苏联对匈牙利的行动，并且着重指出，战胜反革命才使得匈牙利劳动人民有可能在匈牙利社会主义工人党的领导下在自由、独立和民主的国家中继续建设社会主义。声明中强调指出，匈牙利人民可以得到德国和捷克斯洛伐克人民的全力支持和帮助。
    联合声明指出，只有在两党坚决维护的马克思列宁主义学说的基础上才能巩固世界社会主义体系。德国统一社会党和捷克斯洛伐克共产党坚决拒绝任何提出其他共产主义运动纲领的企图。声明中说，所有莫须有的“民族共产主义”的言论都是违反马克思列宁主义的。两党着重指出整个世界共产主义运动团结的必要性，以及为反对帝国主义挑衅行动和各种机会主义者和工人运动叛徒的反社会主义言行而进行共同斗争的必要性。
    应当指出，波兰统一工人党的领导机构和党的报刊反对反社会主义的言论，号召加强社会主义国家间的友谊和合作。
    帝国主义反动派正在设法实现他们进攻民主力量和社会主义力量的计划。劳动人民反对这个计划的有力而可靠的方法，就是在无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下更紧密地团结起来。
    帝国主义分子想在社会主义国家间制造隔阂的企图遭到了失败。社会主义阵营国家高举着无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，以友谊和合作来显示社会主义国际主义原则的伟大的生命力。
    过去的一年是国际共产主义运动的力量有了新高涨的一年。在1956年，苏联、中国、法国和意大利这几国最大的共产党举行了代表大会。多数国家的共产党代表都以来宾身份出席了这些代表大会。这些代表大会表明，各国共产党的兄弟联系在马克思列宁主义的基础上大大地扩大和加强了。
    成为社会主义国家间相互关系的领导原则的无产阶级国际主义政策表现了巨大的不断进步的生命力。
    毛泽东同志在讲到社会主义力量的增长的时候写道：“现在苏联已达到这样的强大，中国人民革命已获得这样的伟大胜利，各人民民主国家的建设已有这样的巨大成就，世界各国人民的反压迫反侵略的运动已有这样的高涨，而我们的友谊和团结的阵线又是这样的巩固，所以，完全可以断言，对于任何帝国主义的侵略，我们都是不怕的。任何帝国主义的侵略都将被我们所粉碎，一切卑鄙的挑拨都是完全没有用的。”
    当前的国际情势说明，帝国主义反动派在设法实现他们进攻民主力量和社会主义力量的处心积虑的计划。劳动人民对帝国主义反动派的这一类行动有一个有力而可靠的方法——那就是在无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下更紧密地团结起来。
