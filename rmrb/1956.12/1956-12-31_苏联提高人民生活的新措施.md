    New Soviet Measures to Improve People's Livelihood
    Ying Xiu
    Since the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in February of this year, the CPSU and the Soviet government have adopted a series of significant measures to further improve the people's livelihood.
    Concern for the improvement of the people's material well-being is the highest principle of the Communist Party's activities. In a socialist country under the leadership of the Communist Party, the purpose of all economic and cultural construction is to continuously improve the people's welfare and raise their cultural level in order to fully meet their material and spiritual needs.
    With the vigorous development of production, the national income of the Soviet Union has increased year by year, and the living standards of the working people have also greatly improved. Compared with 1940, in 1956, the textile products purchased by the working people increased by 94% to more than double, of which woolen fabrics increased by two to more than two times; leather shoes increased by 83% to 95%; the consumption of meat and fats increased by 54% to 62%, and the consumption of milk and sugar also increased by 50% to more than double, even two times.
    The 20th Congress of the CPSU paid even greater attention to further improving the people's welfare. In addition to stipulating that the real wages of workers and staff should be increased by about 30% and the income of collective farm members should be increased by 40% in the Sixth Five-Year Plan, it also proposed a series of other measures to improve the people's lives.
    The new National Welfare Law promulgated in July of this year is an important one of these new measures. This law greatly increased the amount of welfare payments compared with the old law of 1932, especially the amount of low-level welfare payments. The scope of people receiving welfare benefits has also been expanded. The new welfare law stipulates that workers, soldiers, students, and citizens who are injured on duty have the right to receive welfare benefits. At the same time, the families of these citizens mentioned above also have the right to receive welfare benefits when they lose their supporters.
    Welfare benefits are divided into three types: pensions, disability compensation, and survivor benefits. The various welfare benefits stipulated in the new law are generally increased by one to two times compared with the past. The minimum amount of pension is now 300 rubles, and the maximum is 1,200 rubles. Disability welfare payments are based on the degree of disability, with payments equal to 65% to 100% of the worker's original income. At the same time, people who are disabled due to general illness also have the right to receive welfare benefits. In short, according to the new welfare law, all elderly and incapacitated citizens can receive state assistance. Soviet citizens fully and practically enjoy the right won by the October Revolution and fixed by the Soviet Constitution—the right to material security in old age, sickness, and loss of working ability.
    This year, the Soviet government also implemented several measures to shorten the working day. Starting from March of this year, the working day before holidays and festivals has been shortened by two hours. People can go home earlier. Mothers can go to nurseries and kindergartens earlier to pick up their children. In addition, the working hours for teenagers aged 16 to 18 are stipulated as six hours per day, but the wages are equal to those for working eight hours. This allows teenagers who are developing to have more time to study and participate in cultural and recreational activities.
    The government also promulgated new measures to care for women this year. From April 1st of this year, maternity leave for Soviet women has been extended from seventy-seven days to one hundred and twelve days. Recently, the government has also stipulated that women working in enterprises and institutions can receive an additional three months of supplementary leave (without pay) after maternity leave, so that mothers can better take care of their infants. At the same time, if a woman wants to temporarily leave her job after childbirth, her length of service will still be retained within one year.
    The resting conditions for mothers are also getting better day by day. It is now stipulated that by the end of next year, eighteen more sanatoriums and convalescent homes will be opened throughout the Soviet Union, exclusively for the use of pregnant women and mothers with children. People with financial difficulties can be exempted from fees.
    From the New Year, the wages of some low-wage workers will be increased. It is expected that 8 billion rubles will be allocated from the 1957 national economic plan and state budget to implement measures to increase the wages of low-wage workers and staff. This will ensure that the wages of all the above-mentioned workers are increased by approximately 33%.
    Tuition fees for secondary schools and universities have also been completely abolished this year. There are nearly two million college students in the Soviet Union this year. This number is more than twice the total number of college students in various European capitalist countries.
    In addition to these measures implemented in a short period of time this year, the Soviet government is currently preparing to shorten the working day for workers and staff to seven hours, or to change to a five-day work week with eight hours per day, starting from next year. Some companies have already begun piloting this in the fourth quarter of this year.
    The Soviet Union has taken or is preparing to take so many major measures to improve the people's livelihood in a short period of time. This vividly demonstrates the care of the Soviet Communist Party and the government for the people, and also shows the growth of the Soviet state's economic strength, reflecting the brilliant achievements of the Soviet Union on the road to building communism.

    苏联提高人民生活的新措施
    英秀
    自从今年2月苏联共产党第二十次代表大会以后，苏联共产党和政府先后采取了许多重大措施，来进一步改善人民的生活。
    关心人民物质福利的提高是共产党的活动的最高准则。在共产党领导下的社会主义国家里，一切经济建设和文化建设的目的就是不断增进人民福利，提高他们的文化水平，以充分满足人民的物质和精神需要。
    随着生产的蓬勃发展，苏联的国民收入一年年增加，劳动人民的生活水平也大大提高了。同1940年相比，1956年劳动人民购买的织品增加了94％到一倍以上，其中毛织品增加了两倍或两倍以上；皮鞋增加了83％至95％；肉类和脂肪的消费量增加了54％至62％，奶类和糖的消费量也都增加了50％到一倍以至二倍以上。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会对进一步提高人民福利给予了更大的注意，除规定在第六个五年计划中要把职工的实际工资提高约30％、集体农庄庄员的收入提高40％以外，还提出了一系列改进人民生活的其他措施。
    今年7月颁布的国家优抚金新法案，就是这些新措施中重要的一项。这项法案较1932年的旧法案大大提高了优抚金的金额，特别是低级优抚金的金额。领取优抚金人的范围也扩大了。新的优抚金法规定职工、军人、学生和因公务而伤残的公民都有领优抚金的权利。同时上边谈到的这些公民的家属在失掉赡养人的时候，也都有领取优抚金的权利。
    优抚金分为养老金、伤残抚恤金和失去赡养人的抚恤金三种。新法案规定的各项优抚金一般都比过去增加了一倍到两倍。现在养老金的最低限额是三百卢布，最高是一千二百卢布，伤残优抚金则根据伤残程度领取等于职工本人原来收入的65％至100％的优抚金。同时，因一般疾病而伤残的人也有权领取优抚金。总之，根据新的优抚金法案，一切年老和失掉劳动力的公民都可以得到国家的帮助。苏联公民充分而实际地享受着十月革命所争取到的并为苏联宪法所固定下来的权利——在年老、患病和丧失劳动能力时的物质保证权。
    今年苏联政府在缩短工作日方面也实行了若干措施。从今年3月起，假日和节日前一天的工作日就缩短了两小时。人们可以早些回到家中。母亲们可以早些到托儿所和幼儿园去接自己的子女了。此外，十六岁至十八岁的少年每天工作规定为六小时，工资却同做八小时工作时相等。这可以使正在发育成长的少年有更多的时间学习和参加文化娱乐活动。
    政府今年还颁布了关怀妇女的新措施。从今年4月1日起，苏联妇女的产假已从七十七天延长为一百一十二天了。最近，政府又规定在企业和机关中工作的妇女，在产假后可以再多得到三个月的补充假期（不付工资），以使做母亲的能够更好地照顾乳儿。同时，如果妇女想在产后暂时离开工作岗位的话，在一年之内她的工龄仍然保留。
    母亲们的休息条件也一天比一天好了。现在规定到明年年底，全苏联再开办十八所疗养院和休养所，专供孕妇和带孩子的母亲享用。经济困难的人可以免缴费用。
    从新年起，一些低工资的职工的工资就要提高了。预计1957年度国民经济计划和国家预算中将拨出八十亿卢布用来实行提高低工资工人和职员的工资的措施。这样就可以保证所有上述劳动者的工资大约提高33％。
    中学和大学的学费今年也全部免去了。今年苏联的大学生约近两百万人。这个数字等于欧洲各资本主义国家的大学生总和的两倍多。
    除去今年短短的时期内所实行的这些措施外，苏联政府目前正在准备从明年起把职工的工作日都缩短为七小时，或者改为每周工作五天，每天八小时。一些企业已经在今年第四季度就开始试行了。
    苏联在短短的时间内就采取了或正在准备采取这样多改进人民生活的重大措施。这鲜明地表现出苏联共产党和政府对人民的关怀，同时也说明苏维埃国家经济力量的增长，反映出苏联在建设共产主义道路上所获得的光辉成就。（附图片）
