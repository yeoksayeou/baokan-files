Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The representatives attending the Second Member Representative Congress of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce held group discussions yesterday afternoon and today on the reports by Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Vice Premier of the State Council, Bo Yibo.

The representatives unanimously endorsed Chen Shutong's report. Some representatives from the Hubei delegation believed that the report clearly pointed out that the main task of industrialists and businessmen at present is to work with the people of the whole country to solve the main contradiction in our country—the contradiction between the advanced socialist system and the backward social productive forces. The direction of future efforts has also been clarified, and the enthusiasm for returning to work is even greater.

The representatives discussed with great interest Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the issues of fixed interest and removing the "capitalist" label. Representatives of large, medium, and small capitalists expressed satisfaction with the government's two policies. Some representatives said that in this way, large, medium, and small capitalists can each find their place and be at ease. A group from the Shanghai delegation focused on discussing the important significance of adopting these policies. They believed that the determination of these two policies will greatly increase the enthusiasm of all industrialists and businessmen, encourage them to contribute their strength more willingly and happily, and serve national construction. This is beneficial to both the country and the self-transformation of industrialists and businessmen. Some representatives pointed out in the discussion that while industrialists and businessmen are excited and encouraged, they must prevent the complacency and relaxation of self-transformation that may arise in a few people, as well as irresponsible work, extravagant and wasteful lifestyles, and arbitrary squandering of money. They suggested that local federations of industry and commerce should strengthen ideological education work based on this new situation.

Today, many delegations began to discuss how industrialists and businessmen should further play an active role under the spirit of the government's policies. Cheng Jixian, a representative from Shanghai, proposed in the discussion that he should better exert his strength in the enterprise in the future. He said that after returning, he would contribute his technology to the country without reservation, spread his experience, take the initiative to improve the public-private partnership, and participate in socialist competition. Zhang Zeduo, a representative from Jilin Province, said that in the future, he would be diligent and thrifty, overcome waste, carry forward the spirit of hard work and simplicity, and also participate in labor competitions to transform himself in practice. Ying Yili, a family member of an industrialist and businessman from Tianjin, said that it is good to continue to maintain fixed interest, but we cannot wait. Fertilization is needed for melons to ripen. The family members of industrialists and businessmen should be good at arranging housework, be diligent and frugal, so as to transform themselves into self-reliant laborers.

    工商联会员代表大会分组讨论两个报告
    新华社12日讯　出席全国工商业联合会第二届会员代表大会的代表，昨天下午和今天分组讨论全国工商联主任委员陈叔通和国务院副总理薄一波的报告。
    代表们对陈叔通的报告，一致表示拥护。湖北省代表团的有些代表认为这个报告明确指出了工商业者当前的主要任务是和全国人民一道为解决我国当前的主要矛盾——先进的社会主义制度同落后的社会生产力之间的矛盾而努力，对今后努力的方向也明确了，回去工作的劲头更大了。
    代表们以极大的兴趣讨论了薄一波副总理报告中关于定息和摘帽子的问题。不论是大、中、小资本家的代表对政府这两项政策都表示满意。有的代表说，这样一来大、中、小资本家都能各得其所，各安其心。上海代表团的一个小组，着重讨论了采取这些政策的重要意义，他们认为这两项政策的确定，将大大提高所有工商业者的积极性，可以鼓励他们更安心更愉快地贡献自己的力量，为国家建设服务，这样既对国家有利也有利于工商业者的自我改造。有些代表在讨论中提出，工商业者在兴奋鼓舞的同时，必须防止少数人可能产生的安于现状，放松自我改造的思想，和工作上不负责任，生活上奢侈浪费、任意挥霍的行为。他们建议各地工商联应该根据这种新的情况加强思想教育工作。
    今天，许多代表团开始讨论到在政府这样的政策精神下，工商业者应该怎样进一步发挥积极作用的问题。上海市代表程季贤在讨论中提出今后要在企业中更好地发挥力量，他表示回去后要把自己的技术毫无保留地贡献给国家，传播经验，要主动搞好公私共事关系，参加社会主义竞赛。吉林省代表张泽多说，今后要勤俭节约，克服浪费，发扬艰苦朴素作风，还要参加劳动竞赛，在实践中改造自己。天津市工商业者家属应伊利说，定息继续保持下去是好的，但是我们不能坐等，瓜熟蒂落是要施肥的，工商业者的家属要善于安排家务，勤俭节省，以便把自己改造成为自食其力的劳动者。
