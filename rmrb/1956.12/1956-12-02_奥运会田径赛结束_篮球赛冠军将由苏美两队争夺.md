　　Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne, December 1st: The Olympic track and field competition has concluded. Three world records were broken this afternoon: in women's high jump, women's 4x100 meter relay, and men's 4x100 meter relay.
    The women's high jump champion was the American Black athlete, McDaniel, who used the straddle technique, with a result of 1.76 meters.
    The women's 4x100 meter relay was won by the Australian team, with a time of 44.5 seconds, breaking the current world record by 0.7 seconds.
    The American team won the men's 4x100 meter relay championship, with a time of 39.5 seconds, breaking the world record of 39.8 seconds set by the American team in 1936.
    The Soviet team, which came in second, tied the world record with a time of 39.8 seconds.
    The men's 4x400 meter relay was won by the American team, with a time of 3 minutes 4.8 seconds.
    In the 1,500 meter race final, Irish athlete Delaney took first place with a time of 3 minutes 41.2 seconds.
    The marathon race was particularly noteworthy. French long-distance runner Mimon, 35 years old, ran the 42.195 kilometers in 2 hours and 25 minutes, winning the championship.
    Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne, December 1st: The round-robin tournament in the second group of the Olympic basketball competition concluded last night. The Soviet team defeated the French team 56-49, and the American team defeated the Uruguayan team 101-38. Like in the previous session, the Olympic basketball championship in this session will again be contested by the Soviet and American teams.
    Soviet giant center Krumins, who had only played about fifteen minutes in total since the start of the Olympic basketball competition, played the entire game yesterday and scored twenty-seven points on his own.
    Krumins did not play in the previous Soviet team match against the French team. This time, when he waved his large hands and blocked the French team's offensive routes like a Vajra, the French team often found themselves at a loss. On the other hand, he also had a great advantage under the basket.

　　奥运会田径赛结束
　  篮球赛冠军将由苏美两队争夺
    据新华社1日讯　墨尔本消息：奥林匹克运动会的田径赛已经结束。今天下午一共打破了三项世界纪录：女子跳高、女子四百公尺接力赛跑和男子四百公尺接力赛跑。
    获得女子跳高冠军的是跳俯卧式的美国黑人选手麦克丹尼尔，成绩是一·七六公尺。
    女子四百公尺接力赛的第一名是澳大利亚队，她们的成绩是四四·五秒，比目前世界纪录缩短了○·七秒。
    美国队取得了男子四百公尺接力赛的冠军，成绩是三九·五秒，打破1936年美国队所创造的三九·八秒的世界纪录。
    获得第二名的苏联队成绩是三九·八秒，平世界纪录。
    男子一千六百公尺接力赛跑的第一名是美国队，成绩三分四·八秒。
    一千五百公尺赛跑决赛的结果，爱尔兰运动员德兰尼以三分四十一·二秒的成绩取得第一名。
    马拉松赛跑十分引人注意。法国三十五岁的长跑家米蒙用二小时二十五分的时间跑完了四十二点一九五公里，获得了冠军。
    据新华社1日讯　墨尔本消息：奥林匹克篮球赛次赛组中的单循环赛已经在昨天晚上结束。苏联队以五十六比四十九分战胜法国队，美国队以一百零一比三十八分战胜乌拉圭队。像上一届一样，这一届的奥运会篮球赛冠军又将由苏联队和美国队来争夺。
    从奥运会篮球赛开始以来一共只打了大约十五分钟的苏联巨人中锋克鲁明在昨天的比赛中打了一整场，他一个人取得了二十七分。
    克鲁明在上次苏联队对法国队的比赛中没有上场。这次当他摇幌着大手掌像金刚一样挡住法国队进攻的路线时，法国队往往陷于束手无策的地步。另一方面，他在篮下也占有极大的优势。
