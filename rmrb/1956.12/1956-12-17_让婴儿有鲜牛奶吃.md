    Let Infants Have Fresh Milk
    Not Entirely a Seasonal Production Decrease
    Currently, it is impossible to order fresh milk in Beijing. My infant, less than five months old, is only fed rice water in the absence of breast milk. As a result, the lively and chubby child has gradually become thin and listless, with constant watery stools. Despite my efforts to order milk, the response remains negative.
    It is said that the inability to order milk is due to the cold weather reducing the milk production of dairy cows. While it is undeniable that seasonal factors affect milk production to some extent, it is incorrect to attribute the decline in milk production entirely to this objective reason. The amount of milk produced largely depends on the properness of the dairy cows' feeding and management. From what I understand, the Beijing Xishan Cooperative's feeding and management of dairy cows have deteriorated since the implementation of the joint venture. They often simply deliver fodder and water to the cows without checking whether they eat or not. The dairy cows, lacking meticulous care, are covered in mud. How can milk production not decrease with such feeding and management? This cooperative produced 7,000 pounds of milk daily in mid-October (before the joint venture), but within a month after the joint venture, by mid-November, milk production had plummeted by more than 3,200 pounds.
    Furthermore, the Beijing Milk Factory also has problems with milk supply. For instance, newborns cannot get fresh milk, while some healthy adult subscribers continue to drink milk. How incongruous this phenomenon appears! If the Beijing State-owned Milk Factory seriously investigated the milk supply situation and made reasonable adjustments, the problem of infants getting milk could be solved better than it is now.

    Please Transfer Some Milk from Places with Abundant Milk
    My wife gave birth to a baby girl on National Day, bringing us endless warmth and joy. However, the issue of the child getting milk has become a problem. My wife is constantly worried and restless about this matter. To solve the problem of the infant getting milk, I personally took our organization's letter of introduction on Sunday and ran to the Beijing Milk General Station and several branches in the western suburbs, such as Shifangyuan and Caigongzhuang, from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, only to return empty-handed.
    It is understood that the shortage of milk and milk powder is due to various reasons, such as the high birth rate of children and the seasonal impact on milk production. However, it must be pointed out that commercial departments also bear an undeniable responsibility in this matter. Everyone remembers that milk powder once experienced sluggish sales this summer, but now it is almost impossible to buy a can of milk powder in some major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Harbin. Can the rise in infant birth rates in the past six months really cause such a drastic change in milk powder supply? According to comrades familiar with the situation, the commercial department reduced the purchase price of Red Star milk powder produced by the Anda Milk Factory in Heilongjiang from over two jiao to over one jiao this summer due to "sluggish sales." The unreasonable purchase price affected milk production, leading to today's stockout of Red Star brand milk powder. Isn't this a shortcoming in the work of commercial departments?
    From what I understand, the milk situation in Tianjin is not as tense as in Beijing. Could the State-owned Beijing Milk Station consider transferring milk from nearby Tianjin, or even from Inner Mongolia further away, to alleviate the serious situation of many infants in Beijing currently not having milk to drink? I eagerly want to know if our state-owned commerce is preparing to take measures.

    Could Adults Who Don't Need Milk Relinquish Their Milk?
    Currently, in the Baotou area, many newborns who cannot eat solid food are unable to get milk or milk powder, causing many infants' parents to worry and fret about their children's health.
    As far as I know, there are four reasons why children cannot get milk: First, the population of Baotou is increasing rapidly, and the milk industry cannot keep up with the population growth. Second, there are some problems with the organizational form of the milk industry, and milk farmers are not highly motivated, which affects milk production. Third, the Baotou Food Company does not provide sufficient specific leadership to the existing milk industry cooperatives, and does not care enough about the lives of the milk industry cooperative workers. Fourth, seasonal production decreases.
    However, the problem must be solved and cannot be delayed for a long time. I don't know if the commercial authorities in Baotou have considered this issue, but I would like to offer my personal opinions. To solve the problem of infants not getting milk, I have thought of four solutions: First, given the current severe shortage of milk, relevant departments need to take temporary emergency measures, that is, strengthen supply regulation and transfer the milk currently consumed by adults who can do without it (except for patients) entirely to infants who must have milk. Second, the milk currently consumed by children over one and a half years old (excluding sick children) should be transferred to infants under one and a half years old after persuasion and mobilization. Third, Baotou should quickly increase the number of dairy cows and develop the milk industry's production to meet the needs of Baotou's population growth. Fourth, the Baotou Food Company should actively help the milk industry improve labor organization, improve production management, tap potential, and increase milk production.
    I hope that state-owned commercial departments will seriously consider my opinions and treat the solution to the problem of infants getting milk as an urgent task. I think that many crying infants and their parents will be very grateful.

### 让婴儿有鲜牛奶吃

    让婴儿有鲜牛奶吃
    不完全是季节性的减产
    目前在北京市订不到鲜牛奶。
  我的不到五个月的婴儿在没有母奶
  的情况下，每天只喂米汤。就这样，活泼肥胖的孩子渐渐的变瘦了，也不活泼了，成天拉的都是屎水。尽管我到处奔走订奶，可是得到回答仍是没有。
    据说订不到奶是因为天冷奶牛的奶量减少了。不可否认因为季节的关系牛奶的产量是要受到一定的影响的，但如果把牛奶产量的减少完全归到这一客观原因上去，那也是不正确的。因为牛奶产量的多少，在很大程度上还决定于对奶牛饲养管理的是否得当。据我了解，北京西山合作社自从实行合营以后，对奶牛的饲养管理大不如以前了。他们对牛的饲养，常常是把草料和水送上去，至于牛吃不吃却无人过问，奶牛由于缺乏细心照料，弄得满身都是泥巴，像这样饲养和管理奶牛，怎么会不减产？这个社在10月中旬（合营前）每天可产七千磅奶，可是自合营以后到十一月中旬的一个月当中，奶的产量即骤减了三千二百多磅。
    另外，北京市牛奶厂在牛奶供应上，也不是没有问题的。比如初生婴儿吃不到鲜牛奶，而某些健康的成人订户却依然喝着牛奶，这种现象显得多么不协调！如果北京市国营奶厂认真调查一下牛奶供应情况，并合理地进行调整，婴儿吃牛奶的问题是可以解决得比现在好一些的。

    请从牛奶多的地方调些牛奶来
    我爱人在国庆节那天生了一个小女孩，孩子的出生给我们带来了无限的温暖和快乐。但小孩吃牛奶却成了问题。我爱人整天为这件事愁眉不展，寝食不安。为了解决婴儿吃牛奶的问题，我亲自在星期日持我们机关介绍信跑北京市牛奶总站，跑西郊的什方院、蔡公庄等几个分站，从上午九时起跑到下午五时回来，结果仍是一无所获。
    据了解，牛奶和奶粉供应紧张的原因是多方面的，像小孩出生率高、奶量受季节影响等，但是仍必须指出，商业部门在这个问题上也有不可推诿的责任。大家都还记得今年夏天奶粉曾经发生滞销，但现在在一些主要城市，像北京、上海、哈尔滨，却几乎买不到一筒奶粉。难道这半年来由于婴儿出生率的提高，竟能造成奶粉供应的这样前后悬殊的状态吗？据熟悉情况的同志谈，像黑龙江安达牛奶厂出产的红星奶粉，今年夏天因为“滞销”，商业部竟把奶粉的收购价格从二角多降到一角多。不合理的收购价格影响了牛奶的生产量，以致造成红星牌奶粉今天的脱销。这难道不是商业部门工作上的缺点吗？
    据我了解，天津的牛奶就没有北京这样紧张的情形。国营北京市牛奶站可否考虑就近从天津，远一点还可以从内蒙古等地调运来牛奶，以减轻北京市许多婴儿目前没有牛奶吃的严重情况。我急迫的想知道我们的国营商业是否正在准备采取措施。　邓锡纯
    不需要吃牛奶的成人  可否把牛奶让出来？
    目前在包头地区许多不能吃食物的初生婴儿吃不到牛奶或奶粉，使许多婴儿的父母为婴儿的健康担心、发愁。
    就我所知，目前孩子们吃不到牛奶的原因有四：一、包头人口增加的很快，牛奶业赶不上人口增长的需要；二、牛奶业的组织形式上存在一些问题，牛奶户经营积极性不高，影响了牛奶产量；三、包头食品公司对现有的牛奶业合作社具体领导不够，对牛奶业合作社的工作人员的生活也关心的不够；四、季节性的减产。
    但是，问题总必须设法解决，而不能长期拖延的。我不晓得包头的商业主管部门考虑过这一问题没有，我愿提出我个人的意见。解决婴儿吃不上牛奶的问题，我想了四个办法：一、在目前牛奶严重不足的情况下，有关部门有必要采取暂时的紧急措施，即加强供应调节，把可以不吃牛奶的成人（病人例外）现在吃的牛奶，一律调剂给必须吃牛奶的婴儿；二、凡是一周岁半以上的孩子（不包括有病的孩子）现在吃的牛奶，应经过说服动员后，调剂给一周岁半以下的婴儿吃；三、在包头市赶快增加奶牛，发展牛奶业的生产，适应包头人口增长的需要；四、包头食品公司积极帮助牛奶业改进劳动组织，改进生产管理，挖掘潜力，增加牛奶产量。
    我希望国营商业部门认真考虑我的意见，把解决婴儿吃牛奶问题作为一件紧急的任务去办理。我想，许多嗷嗷待哺的婴儿和他们的父母都会十分感激的。　邢有祯
