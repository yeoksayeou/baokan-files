Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 30th -- Xinhua News Agency reporter Cao Houde reports: The local state-owned Wuhan Match Factory, relying on its employees to find ways to save materials and reduce costs, has reversed the situation of failing to meet its profit plan for the fourth quarter of this year.

    When formulating the plan for the fourth quarter of this year, the factory considered various factors, and after much calculation, many cadres believed that without increasing production, the state-mandated profit target would definitely not be met.

    However, after discussion, the factory's General Party Branch Committee believed that to reduce costs and complete the profit target, they could not rely solely on the accounting of the department cadres; they had to consult all employees. Therefore, the factory's responsible cadres went to the workshops to get a sense of the situation. After discussing with workers, technicians, and cadres in the workshops, they found that each workshop still had potential for savings. At this time, they convened a factory-wide employee meeting, telling all employees about the difficulties the factory was facing in formulating the cost and profit plan for the fourth quarter, as well as the areas where each workshop needed to work hard to reduce costs, and called on each employee to find ways to save materials and reduce costs in their respective processes. After the meeting, the Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations separately carried out the work of mobilizing the masses.

    As a result, employees came up with many ways to save materials. The four new methods proposed by the workers in the splint-making workshop could save 6.3% of the timber consumption in the whole quarter.

    Based on the cost-saving methods proposed by the employees, the final cost plan formulated by the factory for the fourth quarter was 4% lower than the original calculation, and the amount of profit completed could also be 3.2% more than the state required.

    武汉火柴厂遇困难向职工请教
    迅速找到降低成本、增加利润的方法
    据新华社武汉30日电　新华社记者曹厚德报道：地方国营武汉火柴厂依靠职工群众寻找节约材料和降低成本的办法，扭转了今年第四季度完不成利润计划的局面。
    这个厂在制定今年第四季度计划的时候，根据各种因素，算来算去，结果，不少干部都认为不增加产量，国家规定的上缴利润数肯定完不成。
    但是，这个厂的中共总支委员会经过讨论认为，要降低成本完成上缴利润计划，不能只依靠科室干部的算账，必须向全体职工群众请教。于是，工厂的负责干部分头深入到车间里去摸底。他们同车间里的工人、技术员、干部们商量以后，发现各个车间还都有节约的潜力。这时，他们就召开了全厂职工大会，把工厂在制定第四季度成本和利润计划方面存在的困难，以及各车间要降低成本需要在那些方面努力等问题，都告诉了全体职工，号召每个职工就自己所在的工序找寻节约材料降低成本的办法。会后，党、团、工会组织又分头进行了发动群众的工作。
    结果，职工们提出了很多节约材料的办法。制梗车间职工新提出的四条办法，可以使全季度木材用量节约6.3％。
    这个厂根据职工们提出的节约办法，最后制定的第四季度成本计划要比原来计算的降低4％，完成的利润额也可以比国家要求的多3.2％。
