　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang. The Pingxiang Mining Bureau has completed its basic construction savings tasks ahead of schedule this year. From January to October, the entire bureau saved a total of 218,000 yuan, exceeding the annual savings target by 65%. The best performance in completing the savings task was in civil engineering, with costs reduced by 10.9% compared to the budget. This was followed by wiring engineering and installation engineering, which decreased by 8% and 6% respectively. Only the tunneling engineering did not complete the savings task, with costs increasing by 2.64% compared to the budget. The main reasons for the better completion of savings tasks in civil engineering, wiring and installation engineering were the strengthening of management work, the adoption of a large number of rationalization proposals and the use of many kinds of substitute materials. When the Mining Bureau recently inspected and summarized the completion of the basic construction savings task this year, in addition to affirming the achievements, it also pointed out that the potential of the whole bureau had not been fully exploited. If the management level could be improved one step further than it is now, the savings results would be even greater than they are now.

　  提前完成节约计划
    本报南昌电　萍乡矿务局提前完成了今年的基本建设节约任务。1至10月份全局一共节约了二十一万八千多元，超过全年节约任务65％。节约任务完成得最好的是土建工程，成本比预算降低了10.9％。其次是架线工程和安装工程，分别降低了8％和6％。只有井巷工程没有完成节约任务，成本比预算提高了2.64％。土建、架线和安装工程节约任务完成较好的原因，主要是管理工作加强了，采用了大量合理化建议和使用了许多种代用材料。矿务局最近在检查和总结今年以来的基建节约任务完成情况的时候，除肯定成就以外，还指出了全局的潜力还没有全部挖出来，如果管理水平能比现在提高一步，节约成果将比现在更大。
