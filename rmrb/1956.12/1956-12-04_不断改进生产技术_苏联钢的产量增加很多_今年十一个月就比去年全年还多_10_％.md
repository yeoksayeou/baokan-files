Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd Dispatch: According to a TASS report, in the first eleven months of this year, the Soviet metallurgical industry produced approximately 10% more steel than the total steel production of 1955. Enterprises producing high-quality alloy steel have performed particularly well. In November alone, they overfulfilled their production plan by 17,000 tons of steel.

The achievements of Soviet steelworkers are mainly due to the improvement of production technology. Currently, over 93% of steel in Soviet metallurgical enterprises is produced using automated open-hearth furnaces. More than one hundred and seventy steel furnaces are using chrome-magnesite brick (replacing refractory brick) furnace roofs, thereby extending the lifespan of the steel furnaces by more than double.

In addition, advanced oxygen blowing methods have been adopted in many metallurgical enterprises in the Urals, Siberia, along the Dnieper River, and other regions across the country, resulting in an increase of over 20% in the steel output of these factories.

In Soviet metallurgical enterprises, there are currently more than 60,000 inventors and rationalization proposers studying how to further improve metallurgical production. In the first ten months of this year, they put forward more than 160,000 technical innovation proposals, of which more than half have been adopted. As a result, metallurgical enterprises have not only increased production but also saved more than 250 million rubles in funds.

    不断改进生产技术
　　苏联钢的产量增加很多
    今年十一个月就比去年全年还多10％
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社报道：在今年头十一个月中，苏联冶金工业炼出的钢大约比1955年全年的钢产量还多10％。出产高质合金钢的企业工作得特别出色。单在11月份，它们就超计划出产了一万七千吨钢。
    苏联炼钢工人获得的这种成就主要是由于改进了生产技术的结果。目前，苏联冶金工业企业中93％以上的钢是用自动化的平炉炼出来的。有一百七十多个炼钢炉用的是铬镁砖（代替耐火砖）炉顶，因而使炼钢炉的使用期限延长了一倍多。
    此外，在乌拉尔、西伯利亚、第聂伯河沿岸和全国其他地区的许多冶金工业企业中，还采用了先进的氧气鼓风法，这就使得这些工厂的钢产量增加了20％以上。
    在苏联冶金工业企业中，目前有六万多名发明家和合理化建议者在研究如何进一步改进冶金生产。在今年头十个月当中，他们就提出了十六万件以上的技术革新建议，其中有一半以上已经被采用了。这一来，各冶金企业不仅增加了生产，而且节约了两亿五千万卢布以上的资金。
