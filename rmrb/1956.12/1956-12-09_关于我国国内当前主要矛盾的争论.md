　　Debate on the Current Major Contradiction in China

    Over the past month or so, about twenty different newspapers and periodicals across the country have published articles on the question of how to understand the current major contradiction in China—the contradiction between the advanced socialist system and the backward social productive forces. This has sparked debate in over a dozen newspapers such as the *Liberation Daily*, *Guangzhou Daily*, and *Changjiang Daily*. The main point of contention is: Can the so-called "advanced socialist system" be understood as "advanced socialist relations of production"? Are the current domestic relations of production running ahead of the productive forces? This debate is still ongoing. From the opinions seen so far, there are mainly two different views on this issue.

    Some argue that the "advanced socialist system" is the "advanced socialist relations of production." Their reasoning is that the social system refers to the social economic system, or mainly the social economic system that plays a decisive role. The current social economic system in China is basically socialist. Therefore, the contradiction between the advanced socialist system and the backward social productive forces is also the contradiction between the advanced socialist relations of production and the backward productive forces.

    Those who oppose this view argue:

  (1) China currently has both a socialist economy, a semi-socialist economy, and an individual economy. Therefore, it cannot be said that all of China's current relations of production are socialist. (2) The concept of "social system" is a general concept encompassing the social economic base and all its superstructure. If "social system" is understood only as "relations of production," the important significance of their interaction will inevitably be overlooked.

    Those who argue that China's current relations of production are running ahead of the productive forces believe: (1) China's socialist revolution was carried out under the condition of a productive force level lagging behind that of typical capitalist countries. The new socialist system, now basically established, has leapfrogged an entire era, opening up broad room for the development of productive forces. Although the social revolution in production has been basically completed, the technical revolution in production has only just begun. (2) After the change in China's relations of production, the people's needs for material and cultural goods have grown rapidly, promoting the development of productive forces. This is a manifestation of advanced relations of production and backward productive forces. (3) The Party and the state, which have mastered Marxism, can consciously change the old relations of production according to the requirements of the development of productive forces, before the new productive forces have fully matured, opening up broad room for the development of productive forces. (4) The main or secondary aspect of the contradiction between productive forces and relations of production transforms with different historical periods. Under certain conditions, it can be expressed as productive forces lagging behind the development of relations of production. The law that relations of production must be suited to the nature of productive forces is expressed as suitability alternating with unsuitability. The general trend is that they must be suitable, but not like a shadow, following step by step. (5) Some also argue that the so-called relations of production running ahead of the productive forces refers to the relations of production running ahead of the level of productive forces, not ahead of the nature of productive forces; China's current relations of production are suited to the nature of productive forces.

    Those who disagree with the above view argue: (1) If it is said that China's current relations of production have run ahead of the productive forces, it would seem as if China's current relations of production were not established according to the law that relations of production must be suited to the nature of productive forces, but were established based on people's subjective will. (2) The production of any society is the unity of productive forces and relations of production. Although relations of production have a significant impact on productive forces, they are always determined by productive forces. Relations of production running ahead of the productive forces has never happened in the past and will never happen in the future. (3) There is no contradiction between relations of production and productive forces in China. There is only a contradiction between the possibility and reality of the development of productive forces. This is a manifestation of relations of production being suited to the development of productive forces. (4) The so-called "advanced socialist system" means that it is more advanced than any social system in the past. The so-called backward social productive forces means that they are backward compared to the broad development possibilities provided by China's advanced society and compared to the advanced Soviet productive forces; it cannot be said that China's relations of production have run ahead of the productive forces. (5) Another view is that the private ownership system has not yet been completely abolished in China, and the principle of distribution according to work has not yet been fully realized. This shows that China has not yet established complete socialist relations of production, which means that the obstacles to the development of productive forces have not been completely eliminated. Therefore, it is still necessary to continue to improve the relations of production and promote the development of productive forces.

    Judging from the opinions of both sides of the debate, everyone agrees that there is a contradiction between the relations of production and the productive forces in China. The vast majority of comrades also agree that the relations of production play a dominant role in the current contradiction between productive forces and relations of production in China. The problem is that some argue that this incomplete consistency is the relations of production running ahead of the productive forces. Others argue that this incomplete consistency between productive forces and relations of production cannot be said to be relations of production running ahead of productive forces. To say so would be tantamount to saying that China's current relations of production are not suited to the productive forces, even if in another form. It seems that the two sides of the debate have inconsistent understandings of the basic principle that the relations of production must be suited to the nature of the productive forces, and each has its own understanding of the dialectical unity between the relations of production and the productive forces. Therefore, clarifying these points of contention will help us to specifically understand this principle of historical materialism and correctly recognize China's current reality.　(Shuang)

### 关于我国国内当前主要矛盾的争论

　　关于我国国内当前主要矛盾的争论
    关于我国国内当前的主要矛盾——先进的社会主义制度和落后的社会生产力之间的矛盾应如何理解的问题，近一个多月来，全国约有二十多种报刊发表了文章，并在解放日报、广州日报、长江日报等十几种报纸上引起了争论。争论的主要之点在于：所谓“先进的社会主义制度”是否可以理解为“先进的社会主义生产关系”？目前国内的生产关系是否已跑在生产力的前面了？这个争论还在进行中。从现已见到的意见看，关于这个问题主要有两种不同的看法。
    一部分论者主张“先进的社会主义制度”就是“先进的社会主义生产关系”他们所持理由是：社会制度即指社会经济制度，或主要是指起决定作用的社会经济制度，我国目前的社会经济制度已基本上是社会主义的了，所以，先进的社会主义制度同落后的社会生产力之间的矛盾，也就是先进的社会主义生产关系同落后的生产力之间的矛盾。
    反对这种看法的论者认为：
  （一）我国目前既有社会主义的经济，也仍有半社会主义的经济和个体经济，所以不能说我国目前的生产关系都是社会主义的。（二）“社会制度”这一概念是社会经济基础及其全部上层建筑的总的概念，如把“社会制度”仅仅理解为“生产关系”，就不可避免地会忽视它们相互作用的重大意义。
    主张我国目前是生产关系跑在生产力前面的论者认为：（一）我国社会主义革命是在生产力水平落后于典型资本主义国家的情况下进行的，现已基本建立的新的社会主义制度是飞跃了一整个时代，为生产力的发展开辟了广阔的余地，生产的社会革命虽已基本完成，但生产的技术革命还只在开始，（二）我国生产关系改变之后，人民群众对物质、文化的需要迅速增长，推动着生产力向前发展，这就是生产关系先进，生产力落后的表现。（三）掌握了马克思主义的党和国家能够自觉地根据生产力发展的要求，在新的生产力还没有充分成熟的条件下，先改变旧的生产关系，开辟生产力发展的广阔余地，来发展生产力。（四）生产力和生产关系作为矛盾的主要方面或次要方面，是随着不同的历史时期相互转化的，在一定条件下可以表现为生产力落后于生产关系的发展；生产关系必须适合生产力的性质，这种规律是表现为适合了又不适合，不适合了又适合，其总的趋势是一定要适合，但不是如影随形，亦步亦趋。（五）也有些论者认为：所谓生产关系走在生产力前面，是指生产关系走在生产力水平的前面，而不是说生产关系走在生产力性质的前面；我国目前的生产关系和生产力的性质是适合的。
    不同意上述看法的论者的理由是：（一）如果说我国目前生产关系已走在生产力的前面，那就仿佛说我国目前的生产关系不是按照生产关系一定要适合生产力性质的规律建立的，而是凭着人们的主观意愿建立的。（二）任何社会的生产，都是生产力和生产关系的统一，生产关系虽有影响生产力的重大作用，但它是始终被生产力决定的，生产关系走在生产力前面的事，过去没有过，将来也永远不会有。（三）我国目前不存在生产关系和生产力不相适应的矛盾，只存在着生产力发展的可能性和现实性之间的矛盾，这是生产关系适合生产力发展的一种表现。（四）所谓“先进的社会主义制度”是说和历史上过去任何社会制度比它是先进的，所谓落后的社会生产力是指和我国先进的社会所提供的广阔的发展可能性比、和先进的苏联生产力比是落后的；不能说我国生产关系已跑到生产力的前面去了。（五）还有一种意见认为，目前我国私有制还没有最后取消、按劳取酬的原则还未完全实现，足见我国还没有建立完全的社会主义生产关系，这就意味着生产力发展的障碍没有完全扫除。所以现在还是要继续改善生产关系，促进生产力的发展。
    从争论双方的意见看来，大家对于我国目前生产关系和生产力之间存在着矛盾这一点并没有怀疑，绝大部分同志也同意目前我国生产力和生产关系的矛盾中生产关系占主导的方面，问题在于：有些论者认为这种不完全相一致是生产关系跑在生产力前面了。另一些论者则认为，这种生产力和生产关系的不完全相一致，并不能说是生产关系跑在生产力前面，如果这样说，就无异说目前我国的生产关系和生产力不相适合了，那怕是另一种形式的不相适合。看来关于这个问题的争论双方对于生产关系必须和生产力性质相适合的基本原理在认识上是不一致的，对生产关系和生产力两者之间的辩证的统一也各有各的理解。因此，弄清这些争论之点，对于我们具体理解历史唯物主义的这一条原理、正确认识我国目前的实际将会有所帮助。　（霜）
