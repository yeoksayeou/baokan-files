Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 12th: The first phase of construction of China's first modern factory for manufacturing power station boilers—the Harbin Boiler Factory—has been basically completed.

　　Construction of this project began in October 1954. Now, nearly 70,000 square meters of factory buildings and auxiliary buildings have been built on the factory grounds; more than 84% of the equipment to be installed in the entire factory has also been completed.

　　In order to master the technology of manufacturing boilers, the factory's production preparation work has also begun. Workers have made many preparations for the process regulations for manufacturing boilers and valves. And they are trial-producing two types of boilers with steam evaporation rates of 35 tons per hour and 75 tons per hour; eight varieties of medium-pressure valves have been successfully trial-produced. Now, in addition to intensively carrying out the finishing work of the first phase of the project, the temporary acceptance committee is busy preparing various factory construction materials to await national acceptance.

　　After the completion of the first phase of the Harbin Boiler Factory, it can produce boilers with an atmospheric pressure of 40, a superheat of 450 degrees Celsius, and a steam evaporation rate of 130 tons per hour or less. This fundamentally changes the backward situation in which China could not manufacture medium and large-sized medium-pressure boilers for thermal power plants. After the completion of the second phase of the project, this factory will shift from manufacturing medium-pressure boilers to high-pressure boilers. At that time, the boilers, valves, pipelines, and other equipment it produces annually can meet the needs of twelve newly built thermal power plants with a power generation capacity of 50,000 kilowatts.

　　The design, important equipment, and current production preparation work of the Harbin Boiler Factory have all received selfless assistance from the Soviet Union. This factory has adopted the latest achievements in Soviet boiler manufacturing technology, and its technical equipment is excellent and advanced; after it is put into production in the future, it will widely adopt automatic welding methods, and the boilers produced will also adopt the advanced Soviet experience of pre-assembling components, which will greatly shorten the time for installing boilers in power stations.

    采用苏联技术上最新成就
    哈尔滨锅炉厂首期工程基本完成
    改变了我国不能制造中型大型火力发电站中压锅炉的局面
    新华社哈尔滨12日电　我国第一座制造电站锅炉的现代化工厂——哈尔滨锅炉厂第一期工程已经基本建成。
    这项工程是在1954年10月动工兴建的。现在，厂区地面上已经建起将近七万平方公尺的厂房和附属建筑；全厂需要安装的设备也完成了84％以上。
    为了掌握制造锅炉的技术，这个厂的生产准备工作也已经开始。职工们对制造锅炉、阀门的工艺规程作了不少的准备。并且正在试制每小时蒸汽蒸发量三十五吨和每小时蒸汽蒸发量七十五吨的两种锅炉；中压阀门已经试制成功八个品种。现在，全厂除了紧张地进行第一期工程的收尾工作以外，临时的验收委员会正忙着准备各种建厂资料，以待国家验收。
    哈尔滨锅炉厂第一期工程建成以后，可以生产四十个大气压的，摄氏四百五十度过热的、每小时蒸汽蒸发量为一百三十吨以下的锅炉。这样，就根本上改变了我国不能制造中、大型火力发电站用的中压锅炉的落后局面。到第二期工程完成以后，这个厂将由制造中压锅炉转为高压锅炉。那时，它每年生产的锅炉、阀门、管道等设备，可以满足十二个发电能力五万瓩的新建火力发电站的需要。
    哈尔滨锅炉厂的设计、重要设备和目前正在进行的生产准备工作，都得到苏联无私的援助。这个厂由于采用了苏联锅炉制造技术上的最新成就，技术装备是优良先进的；将来投入生产以后，将广泛采用自动焊接的加工方法，生产出来的锅炉也将采用苏联预先装成组合件的先进经验，这样会大大缩短电站安装锅炉的时间。
