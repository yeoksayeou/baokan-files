　　Post-Editing Thoughts

　　After reading several reader letters published today, I really want to shout: "No hoarding or wasting staff!"
　　People are the most valuable asset. No one would disagree with this in principle.
　　Many organizations and enterprises ask for people from higher authorities, transfer people from lower levels, and recruit people from society. They run around, urge relentlessly, and are as hungry and thirsty. They seem to deeply understand that "people are the most valuable asset."
　　However, in many organizations (including those that are asking for people everywhere), many staff members are idle and have nothing to do.
　　With more people than tasks, opinions vary, so some have to deliberately find unnecessary things to do for these practically idle people.
　　For example, the Russian Language Training Class of the Nonferrous Metals Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has too many translators, so it organizes a "Teaching and Research Group" to "study and summarize teaching experience." This seems necessary, but if you dig deeper, is it really necessary for a small Russian Language Training Class to specifically organize a large "Teaching and Research Group"? A bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building allows future school teachers to first go to "workshops for practical experience," which seems good, but the school will not open until 1958, and teachers are assigned to "workshops for practical experience" this year, which is a bit too hasty!
　　It is easy to casually find some work to prevent people from being too idle, so as to cover up the situation of overstaffing. But it is difficult to streamline the organization and remove the surplus people. So what should we do? First of all, we should expose this illusion of covering up overstaffing; secondly, we should criticize the thinking that does not value people, and urge those organizations and enterprises that ask for people but do not use them to release the surplus people and let them do more truly necessary work.

　　编后杂感
    看了今天发表的几篇读者来信，真想大喝一声：“不准积压或浪费工作人员！”
    人是最宝贵的财产。这个道理，说起来谁都不会反对。
    许多机关，许多企业都向上级要人，从下级调人，在社会上招人。他们东奔西走，紧催不舍，如饥如渴。看来像是深知“人是最宝贵的财产”的。
    然而，许多机关（包括这些到处要人的机关在内），不少的工作人员却在那儿闲着，无事可作。
    人多事少，意见纷纭，于是某些不得不有意地去为这些实际上的闲人找一些并不必要的事情做。
    例如，冶金工业部有色金属管理局俄文训练班，翻译多了，便组织“教研组”，“研究和总结教学经验”。这似乎是必要的，如果深追一步，一个小小的俄文训练班是否有必要专门组织一个庞大的“教研组”？第一机械工业部的一个管理局让未来的学校教师，先去“下厂实习”，看起来很好，可是学校1958年才开学，今年就配备了教师“下厂实习”，也未免操之太急了！
    随便找点工作，不致让人太闲了，借以掩饰人浮于事的情况，是很容易的。但要紧缩机构，把多余人抽出去，就很困难。那么怎么办呢？首先，应该揭发这种掩饰人浮于事的假象；再就是批判不重视人的思想，督促那些要了人而并不用人的机关和企业，把多下来的人放出来，让他们多做些真正必要的工作去。
