Regularly Receive Mass Visits

    (Our newspaper reports) The leaders of the industrial, basic construction and other departments of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China regularly receive visits from grassroots cadres and the masses, which is welcomed by the masses.

    Starting in September, the ministers and deputy ministers of each department have basically adhered to talking with cadres and workers from factories and mines on Saturday afternoons. For the correct demands of the masses, they immediately urge the enterprise leaders to find ways to solve them; for excessive demands, they patiently persuade them; for issues of general significance, they promptly notify all units to pay attention. By receiving mass visits, not only has the construction enthusiasm of the masses been encouraged, but it has also helped the leaders to understand the situation at the lower levels, comprehensively understand the cadres, discover problems, and urge the lower-level party committees to deal with problems in a timely manner.

    定期接待群众来访
    本报讯　中共太原市委工业基本建设等部领导人员，定期接待基层干部和群众来访，受到群众欢迎。
    9月起，各部正副部长基本上都坚持了星期六下午同来自厂矿工地的干部和工人谈话。对于群众正确的要求，即督促企业领导方面设法解决；过高的要求，即耐心说服；有普遍意义的问题，便及时通知各单位注意。通过接待群众来访，不仅鼓舞了群众的建设热情，同时对领导人员了解下层情况、全面认识干部、发现问题及督促下级党委及时处理问题均有帮助。　（顾）
