　　Shanghai Joint Ventures Improve Employee Living Standards
    More than 200,000 people enjoy medical and labor insurance benefits; more than 7,000 nurseries and lactation rooms have been newly built; the phenomenon of work stoppages and unpaid wages is gone forever.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 3rd: Jiefang Daily reports: In the ten months since the implementation of full industry public-private partnerships, there have been many improvements in the living welfare of employees in Shanghai's new joint ventures. More than half of the 400,000 employees who previously did not enjoy medical and labor insurance benefits now have access to these benefits. More than 7,000 nurseries and lactation rooms newly built in the new joint ventures have begun to serve female workers. Employee housing is also under construction; two industrial bureaus alone have built more than 700 units. The tragic phenomenon of "work stoppages, unpaid wages, and suspended meals" caused by unstable production before the enterprise partnerships is gone forever. A large amount of back pay left over from the private sector era (listed in the accounts of the joint ventures) is also being paid in installments. The back pay recently paid to employees by more than 20 specialized companies in the heavy industry system alone amounted to more than 4 million yuan. Wage reforms in the new joint ventures are being actively prepared, and employees with excessively low wages have temporarily solved their difficulties through advance payments. Employees with particularly difficult economic circumstances have also received subsidies from the trade union. The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions has allocated more than 110,000 yuan in subsidies to employees of new joint ventures since the second quarter.
    The gradual improvement of the living welfare of employees in Shanghai's new joint ventures is based on production development. From January to October this year, the output value of new joint venture factories under the central government's leadership increased by more than 90% compared to the same period last year, and the output value of new joint venture factories under local leadership also increased by more than 38%. Many of the workers' quarters built by the Shanghai No. 1 Heavy Industry Bureau were partially funded by profits extracted from the enterprises.

　　上海合营企业职工生活改善
    二十多万人享受了医疗、劳保待遇；新建了七千多个托儿所和哺乳室；停工停薪现象已一去不返。
    新华社上海3日电　解放日报消息：全行业公私合营十个多月来，上海市新合营企业职工生活福利已有很多改善。过去没有享受医疗、劳保待遇的四十多万职工，现在有半数以上享受了这些待遇。新合营工厂中新建的七千多个托儿所和哺乳室，已开始为女工服务。职工住宅也正在兴建，仅两个工业局就兴建了七百多户。企业合营前因生产不稳定而产生的“停工、停薪、停伙”的悲惨现象已一去不返，私营时期遗留下来的大量欠薪（列为合营企业账目内的）也正在分期发还。重工业系统二十多个专业公司最近发还的职工欠薪，就有四百多万元。新合营企业的工资改革正在积极准备，工资过低的职工已通过预借的方式，暂时解决了困难，经济特别困难的职工还得到工会的补助，上海市工会联合会第二季度以来拨给新合营企业职工的补助费共有十一万多元。
    上海新合营企业职工生活福利的逐步改善，是在生产发展的基础上获得的。今年1月到10月，全市属于中央领导的新合营工厂的产值比去年同期增长了90％多，属于地方领导的新合营工厂的产值也增长了38％多。上海市第一重工业局为职工兴建的许多工房，部分投资就是由企业利润中提取出来的。
