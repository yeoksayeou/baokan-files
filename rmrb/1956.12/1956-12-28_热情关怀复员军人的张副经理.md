    Warm Care for Demobilized Soldiers from Deputy Manager Zhang
    To the Editor:
    Properly settling demobilized soldiers is an important task for us. Zhang Ming, Deputy Manager of the Xuchang City Food and Beverage Company in Henan Province, pays great attention to this work.
    This year, twenty-one demobilized soldiers were transferred to the company. At that time, two of the demobilized soldiers had made mistakes in other units in the past, but he still settled them in just the same. He said, "We cannot use some past mistakes to measure a person. Most demobilized soldiers have undergone the test of battle and have a certain degree of political awareness. The main issues for them are education and cultivation."
    Comrade Zhang Ming did indeed do this. At the beginning, the demobilized soldiers were not settled in their work because they were unfamiliar with the business. Comrade Zhang Ming helped them with their work and also carried out educational work according to their different ideological situations. Now, several demobilized soldiers have been promoted to positions such as branch manager, director, and section chief due to their increased work ability.
    Comrade Zhang Ming not only cares about their thoughts and work, but also cares about their personal lives and family difficulties. He reasonably adjusted their grades with reference to their original ranks. Those with family difficulties were also given subsidies. In addition, Comrade Zhang Ming also enthusiastically helped two comrades solve their marriage problems.
    Thanks to Comrade Zhang Ming's efforts, everyone unanimously elected him as a model for settling demobilized soldiers and requested the higher authorities to give him an award.

    热情关怀复员军人的张副经理编辑同志：
    妥善地安置复员军人的工作是我们一项重要任务。河南省许昌市饮食公司副经理张铭是很注意这项工作的。
    今年有二十一位复员军人调到公司中来，当时有两位复员军人过去在别的单位犯过错误，但他也一样安置他们。他说：“不能用过去一些过失来衡量一个人。复员军人大都经过战斗考验，并有一定的政治觉悟，对他们主要是教育和培养的问题。”
    张铭同志的确是这样做的。开始时，复员军人因为业务生疏，工作不够安心。张铭同志便在业务上帮助他们，同时根据他们的不同思想情况进行教育工作。现在有几位复员军人因工作能力提高已提拔为分店经理、主任、股长等职务。
    张铭同志不但关心他们的思想和工作，而且也关心他们的个人生活和家庭困难。他参照他们的原级别合理地调整了他们的级别。家庭有困难的还给予补助，此外，张铭同志还热情地帮助两位同志解决了婚姻问题。
    由于张铭同志的努力，大家一致评选他为安置复员军人的模范，并提请上级给他奖励。
