    Mercury Rectifier
    The Jinxihua State-Owned Chemical Plant has recently successfully trial-produced a mercury rectifier using domestically produced components.
    The mercury rectifier is a device used to convert alternating current into direct current. Its manufacturing technology is quite complex; many components could not be manufactured in our country in the past, and many materials were also impossible for us to solve in the past. Now, the cathode and anode switch graphite electrode materials trial-produced by the Jinzhou Dazhong Electrical Machinery Plant have also been made under the guidance of Soviet expert Terbochishava.

    水银整流器
    国营锦西化工厂最近采用国产部件把水银整流器试制成功了。
    水银整流器是用来把交流电变为直流电的设备。它的制造技术相当复杂，很多部件是我国过去制造不了的，有很多材料也是我们过去无法解决的。现在，锦州大中电机厂试制的阴极和阳极开关石墨电极材料，也在苏联专家捷尔波奇沙娃的指导下做成了。　（冯体钧）
