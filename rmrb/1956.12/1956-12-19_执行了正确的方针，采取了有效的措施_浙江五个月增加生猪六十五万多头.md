Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou Dispatch: By the end of November, the number of hogs raised in Zhejiang Province had grown to over 3.37 million, of which more than 650,000 were added since July.

The famous hog-producing area of Jinhua Prefecture increased its hog population by 190,000 after July. In Pujiang and Dongyang counties, major suppliers of raw materials for Jinhua ham, the average household raises more than one hog; mountainous areas that did not traditionally raise hogs are also raising them in large numbers, and are raising sows as well, basically achieving self-breeding and self-raising. Yuhang County, which suffered relatively severe typhoon damage in August of this year, has made hog raising a major project for agricultural cooperatives to develop sideline production.

The leading departments of Zhejiang Province implemented the policy of focusing on household hog raising, supplemented by public collective raising, and developing collective hog raising in a focused and conditional manner within agricultural cooperatives. The purchase price of hogs is currently 5.4% higher than at the beginning of the year. This year, more than 300 million jin of refined feed for hog raising has been supplied to various regions. Some agricultural cooperatives have also reserved a certain amount of farmland for members to cultivate hog feed. Some agricultural cooperatives have also appropriately increased the depreciation value of fertilizers and rationally adjusted hog-raising work points, improving the enthusiasm of members for hog raising.

    执行了正确的方针，采取了有效的措施
    浙江五个月增加生猪六十五万多头
    据新华社杭州电　到11月底，浙江省各地饲养的生猪已经发展到三百三十七万头以上，其中有六十五万多头是7月以来增加的。
    著名的生猪产地金华专区7月以后增加的猪就有十九万头。金华火腿原料主要供应地的浦江、东阳等县，平均每户养猪都在一头以上；过去没有养猪习惯的山区，也大量养猪，而且养了母猪，基本上做到了自繁自育。今年8月遭受台风侵害比较严重的余杭县，养猪成了农业社开展副业生产的一个大项目。
    浙江省领导部门在农业社中贯彻了以家庭养猪为主、公有分养为辅、有重点有条件地发展集体养猪的方针。猪的收购价格目前比年初提高了5.4％。今年，并供应各地养猪用的精饲料三亿多斤。有些农业社，还把一定面积的田地留给社员培育养猪饲料。有些农业社还适当提高了肥料的折价，合理调整了养猪工分，提高了社员的养猪积极性。
