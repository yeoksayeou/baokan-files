Xinhua News Agency, December 7th: Washington - Using the Soviet army's assistance to the Hungarian government in crushing the counter-revolutionary riots as an excuse, the United States is enabling American troops to continue stationing troops at the Keflavik Air Base in Iceland.

The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 6th saying, "The United States Government and the Icelandic Government agree that the recent developments in the world situation, as well as the continued threats to the security of Iceland and the North Atlantic Group, require the United States to keep defense forces stationed in Iceland in accordance with the U.S.-Icelandic Defense Agreement signed on May 5, 1951. Therefore, negotiations requested by the Icelandic government regarding the revision of the agreement and the withdrawal of defense forces should be suspended."

State Department Press Officer White pointed out that the so-called "recent developments" refer to "Soviet activities in Hungary."

According to the Associated Press, during this meeting, in addition to agreeing to the stationing of U.S. troops, Iceland also agreed to resume the project to expand the Keflavik base. At the same time, the U.S. government promised to provide "economic assistance" to the Icelandic government and agreed that the American authorities at the base would guarantee the maximum long-term employment of Icelanders.

　　美军继续留驻冰岛基地
    据新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：美国以苏联军队帮助匈牙利政府粉碎反革命暴乱为借口，使美国军队继续留驻冰岛的凯夫拉维克空军基地。
    美国国务院在6日发表声明说：“美国政府和冰岛政府一致认为，最近世界局势的发展以及冰岛和北大西洋集团的安全继续受到的威胁，都要求美国根据1951年5月5日签订的美国—冰岛防御协定使防御军队留驻冰岛。因此，冰岛政府请求举行的、关于修改协定和撤退防御部队问题的谈判应该停止。”
    国务院新闻发布官怀特指出，所谓“最近的发展”就是指“苏联在匈牙利的活动”。
    据美联社透露，在这次会谈中，冰岛除答应美军留驻外，还答应恢复扩大凯夫拉维克基地的工程。同时，美国政府答应向冰岛政府提供“经济援助”，并且同意基地上的美国当局保证最大限度地长期雇佣冰岛人。
