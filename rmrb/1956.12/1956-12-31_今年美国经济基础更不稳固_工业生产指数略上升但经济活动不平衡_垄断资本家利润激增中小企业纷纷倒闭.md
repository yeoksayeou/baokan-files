Xinhua News Agency, December 30th, New York dispatch: American bourgeois newspapers believe that the American economy is in a state of so-called "prosperity" in 1956. In this year, the industrial production index rose to 143 (the average for 1947-49 being 100), an increase of 3% over last year. The gross national product is over 400 billion U.S. dollars, investment in industry and mining increased to 35.4 billion U.S. dollars, and export trade increased by 17% compared to last year, estimated at 16.7 billion U.S. dollars. American bourgeois newspapers say that this situation shows that economic activity has reached an unprecedented level.

However, this year is also considered a year in which the foundation of the U.S. economy appears even more unstable. In this year, unsold inventories of American enterprises increased to an unprecedented peak of 86.4 billion U.S. dollars. Whether calculated by population or by household, people's debts are also increasing significantly. The total amount of housing mortgages, installment payments, and other types of debts owed by Americans is about 200 billion U.S. dollars, with the average debt per person accounting for 70% of their annual income. In agriculture, due to sluggish sales of products, this year's cultivated land area has been greatly reduced, and it is expected to decrease further to the lowest level in twenty-seven years next year.

American economic activity this year is unbalanced. In the first half of the year, due to the reduction in production in many important civilian industrial sectors, especially the automotive industry, the U.S. industrial production index remained hesitant and showed a downward trend. In July, the major steel strike pushed the industrial production index down to 128, returning to the production level of 1954. Industrial production only began to gradually rise after August.

American monopoly capitalists have benefited the most this year. According to American newspaper statistics, in the first half of this year, the after-tax profits of American companies increased by nearly 10% compared to the same period last year, of which the net profits of fifteen large companies exceeded 100 million U.S. dollars in the first three quarters of this year. However, from the perspective of ordinary people, the cost of living in the United States this year is unprecedentedly high, and the tax burden has also reached a record figure. At the same time, agricultural product prices have been declining month by month since June, and farmers' incomes have decreased. More than one thousand small and medium-sized enterprises are closing down every month.

When looking forward to the economic situation next year, many American newspapers believe that because corporate investment will increase next year and automobile production will also increase, overall business activity is likely to remain at a high level. In this regard, some newspapers have also specifically mentioned the stimulating effect of the U.S. government's policies on business activity. They expect that the U.S. government's increased military spending next year and planned "aid" to some countries in Western Europe and the Middle East will bring "favorable" impacts to the U.S. economy. However, some newspapers also express concern about the economic outlook. For example, the influential "U.S. News & World Report" predicted in its latest issue that there would be a "moderate" decline in business activity next year. The magazine pointed out that there are signs indicating that "prosperity" will encounter difficulties. It is expected that compared with the peak, the production of many industrial sectors will be reduced, the activity of the stock exchange will gradually decline, and "overproduction" will occur everywhere.

### 今年美国经济基础更不稳固  工业生产指数略上升但经济活动不平衡  垄断资本家利润激增中小企业纷纷倒闭

    今年美国经济基础更不稳固
    工业生产指数略上升但经济活动不平衡
    垄断资本家利润激增中小企业纷纷倒闭
    新华社30日讯　纽约消息：美国资产阶级报刊认为，1956年美国经济处在所谓“繁荣”状态。在这一年，工业生产指数上升到一百四十三（1947—49年的平均数为一百），比去年增加3％。国民生产总值在四千亿美元以上，工矿投资增加为三百五十四亿美元，出口贸易比去年增加了17％，估计有一百六十七亿美元。美国资产阶级报刊说，这种情况说明经济活动已经达到前所未有的水平。
    但是，这一年也被认为是美国经济的基础显得更不稳固的一年。在这一年里，美国企业卖不出去的存货增加到八百六十四亿美元的空前高峰。无论用人口来平均或者以家庭为单位来计算，人民的债务也在大量增长，总计美国人所欠下的房屋抵押、分期付款以及其他种类的债务约有两千亿美元，平均每个人的债务占了全年的收入的70％。在农业方面，由于产品滞销，今年的耕地面积已经大大减少，预计到明年还要再减少到二十七年以来的最低水平。
    美国今年的经济活动是不平衡的。在上半年，由于许多重要的民用工业部门，特别是汽车业的减产，美国工业生产指数一直踌躇不前，并且出现下降的现象，到7月份，钢铁大罢工又把工业生产指数压到一百二十八，回复到1954年年产的水平。8月份以后，工业生产才开始逐步上升。
    美国垄断资本家在这一年中得到了最大的好处。根据美国报刊统计，在今年上半年，美国公司纳税后的利润比去年同时期差不多增加了10％，其中十五家大公司的纯利在今年头三季超过了一亿美元。但是从普通人民方面说来，美国今年生活费用之高是空前未有的，捐税负担也达到破纪录的数字。同时，农产品价格自6月以来逐月下降，农民收入减少。中小企业的倒闭每个月有一千多家。
    在展望明年的经济情况的时候，美国许多报刊认为，由于明年的企业投资将会增加，汽车生产也会增加，整个企业活动很可能仍然维持很高的水平。在这方面，一些报刊还特别提到美国政府的政策对企业活动的刺激作用。它们期望，美国政府明年增加军事开支以及计划中的对西欧和中东一些国家的“援助”，将会给美国经济带来“有利”的影响。但是，也有一些报刊对经济前景表示不安。例如，有影响的“美国新闻与世界报道”在最近一期中就预言明年的企业活动将会发生“温和”的下降。这家杂志指出，有迹象说明，“繁荣”将要遇到困难。预计同最高峰比较，许多工业部门的生产将要减缩，交易所的活跃将逐渐消沉，各处都会发生“生产过剩”的现象。
