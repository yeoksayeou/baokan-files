Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Port Said Dispatch: The first batch of 350 Egyptian police officers entered Port Said today, a city adorned with Egyptian flags and portraits of President Nasser.

They arrived by train this morning from Ismailia to this heroic city, which has been bravely resisting the Anglo-French invaders since it was occupied on November 5th. In Ismailia, hundreds more police officers drawn from various parts of Egypt are preparing to enter Port Said in succession.

Meanwhile, the last batch of invading troops that have not yet withdrawn are cowering in a corner by the sea, enclosed by their own barbed wire, preparing to leave Egyptian territory for good amidst the curses of the Egyptian people. However, the Anglo-French invasion authorities are still unwilling to specify exactly when they will completely withdraw.

On December 17, the commander of the United Nations Emergency Force, Burns, announced that the UN Emergency Force would withdraw from Port Said as soon as possible after the British and French troops had completed their withdrawal.

    新华社18日讯　塞得港消息：埃及第一批警察部队三百五十名今天开进了到处悬挂着埃及国旗和纳赛尔总统肖像的塞得港。
    他们是在今天上午从伊士美利亚乘火车进入这个从11月5日被侵占以来一直在英勇抗击英法侵略者的英雄城市的。在伊士美利亚，还有几百名从埃及各地抽调来的警察部队准备陆续开进塞得港。
    同时，还没有撤退的最后一批侵略军正灰溜溜地躲在他们自己用铁丝网围起来的海边一个角落里，准备在埃及人民咒骂声中最后离开埃及领土。但是英法侵略军当局还不肯说清楚他们到底要在什么时候完全撤出。
    联合国紧急部队司令伯恩斯12月17日曾经宣布，在英法军队撤退完毕后，联合国紧急部队即将尽可能早地撤出塞得港。
