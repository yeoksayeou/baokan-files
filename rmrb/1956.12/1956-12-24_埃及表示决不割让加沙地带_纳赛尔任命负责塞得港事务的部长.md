    Egypt States it Will Never Cede the Gaza Strip
    Nasser Appoints Minister in Charge of Port Said Affairs
    Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd dispatch from Cairo: Cairo Radio broadcast on the 22nd that Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi had notified UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld that Egypt would never agree to ceding the Gaza Strip.
    The radio station quoted an Egyptian official spokesperson as saying that if Israel refused to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, it would involve halting the clearing work of the Suez Canal and would definitely worsen the situation in the Middle East.
    The spokesperson said that it was significant that Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion dared to make demands regarding Gaza only after Lloyd and Pineau publicly declared that Egypt should cede the Gaza Strip.
    The spokesperson said: "It is very important that the United Nations' resolutions on the withdrawal from Egyptian territory and the clearing of the Suez Canal should be observed by all parties concerned." He said: "If Israel insists on disregarding the decisions of this international organization, the worst may happen."
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 23rd: Egyptian President Nasser issued an order on the 22nd appointing Abdul Latif Baghdadi as the Minister in charge of Port Said affairs. Baghdadi is currently the Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs.

    埃及表示决不割让加沙地带
    纳赛尔任命负责塞得港事务的部长
    新华社23日讯　开罗消息：开罗电台22日广播说，埃及外交部长法齐已经通知联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，埃及决不同意割让加沙地带。
    这家电台引用一位埃及官方发言人的谈话说，如果以色列拒绝撤出加沙地带，那将会牵涉到使苏伊士运河清理工作陷于停顿，并且肯定会使中东局势恶化。
    这位发言人说，意味深长的是，只是到劳埃德和比诺公开宣称要埃及割让加沙地带以后，以色列总理本—古里安才敢于提出关于加沙的要求。
    发言人说：“联合国关于撤出埃及国土和清理苏伊士运河的决定应当得到一切有关方面的遵守，这是非常重要的。”他说：“如果以色列坚持无视这个国际组织的决定，那就有可能会发生最坏的事情。”
    据新华社开罗23日电　埃及总统纳赛尔在22日发布命令，任命阿卜杜勒·拉蒂夫·巴格达迪为负责塞得港事务的部长。巴格达迪目前是城乡事务部长。
