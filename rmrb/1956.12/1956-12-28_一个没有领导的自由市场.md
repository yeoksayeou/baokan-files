    A Free Market Without Leadership
    By our reporter Ai Ling
    A few months ago, there was only one vegetable stall beside the sidewalk at Chaoyangmen in Beijing, the rest were selling pancakes and breakfast. After morning, the street became very quiet. Since the opening of the free market, the area near Chaoyangmen has been like a market town, lively from morning till night. Every morning, people push carts full of vegetables and aquatic products, pouring in droves from outside Chaoyangmen. Carts and stalls fill the area near Chaoyangmen and Chaonei Street market, sometimes even extending westward to the vicinity of Dongsi Arch.

    Initially, people praised this free market, feeling it was much more convenient than before. Some said, "I haven't bought live fish like this for a long time! Now they are delivered to my door." Others said, "These green vegetables are fresher than those in state-owned retail stores, and I can choose them myself, and the price is right." There are also many varieties of goods on the market.
    However, gradually, an abnormal atmosphere appeared in the market.

    Now, in addition to the commodities that the state allows to be freely traded, there are also peanuts, sesame, cotton, pork... that should be purchased and controlled by the state. Even cooked pork and donkey meat covered with dust have appeared.

    People have also gradually become dissatisfied with the prices of goods in the market. Pork sold in state-owned retail companies costs 78 cents per jin, and lard costs 90 cents per jin. Pork (with bones) sold in the free market costs 90 cents to 1.20 yuan per jin, and lard costs 1.60 yuan to 2 yuan per jin; dog meat also sells for 60 cents per jin. The retail price of scallions and garlic is more than double the listed price, and customers are only allowed to buy whole bundles, not individual pieces. Many customers shake their heads when they ask the price and say, "Too expensive!" Arguments often occur in the market. An old man bought three jin of pork, but when he weighed it at home, it was only two and a half jin, so he argued with the meat seller. A young woman argued with a cotton seller, saying that the cotton was wet and she wanted to return it.
    The chaos in the prices of goods in the free market has also affected the state-owned commercial sector's control over overall market prices. On December 19, tens of thousands of jin of scallions were piled up like a small mountain in front of the Chaoyangmen Farmers' Service Center. These scallions were transported by train from the No. 1 Senior Agricultural Cooperative of Mazhuang Township, Linwen District, Tai'an County, Shandong Province. The agricultural cooperative did not contact the Beijing Vegetable Company in advance, and now they do not plan to sell the scallions to the vegetable company. The selling price of scallions in Shandong Province is 2 to 4 cents per jin, but now they want to sell them to small vendors for 15 cents per jin. The price of scallions in the free market is already more than double the state-owned retail price. After these tens of thousands of jin of scallions are sold, it will inevitably cause more chaos in market prices. Consumers will also be more dissatisfied. The chaos in the prices of goods in the free market has also affected the purchasing work of state-owned companies. Now, many agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs would rather violate "contracts" than sell vegetables to the vegetable company, and sell them to vendors with small carts at high prices. Some vegetable vendors, in order to pursue high profits, even hide their vendor licenses and disguise themselves as "farmers" to purchase vegetables in the suburbs.

    There are also many vendors in the market, mostly farmers from the countryside. They do business during the day and return to the Farmers' Service Center outside Chaoyangmen to sleep at night, some staying in hotels or sleeping in the streets and alleys. Not all farmers who come to the city to do business make money; some, because they do not understand the market situation, come with great blindness, and end up losing even their capital. An old man from Shijiazhuang heard that there was a shortage of oranges in Beijing and the retail price was high, so he transported a batch of oranges to Beijing to sell, wanting to sell them for 60 or 70 cents per jin (the original price was more than 30 cents per jin). Who knew that when he arrived in Beijing, oranges were sold everywhere, and the price did not exceed 30 cents per jin, so he had to sell the oranges at a loss. He had no choice but to sit by the roadside at Dongsi Arch and weep. Many farmers who come to the city to do business often exceed the scope of farmer trade. According to a one-month statistic from the Chaoyangmen Farmers' Service Center, more than half of the 1,073 people were engaged in speculative business. Many farmers come to the city empty-handed, stay in the city, and use high-priced purchases and halfway interception methods to resell commodities that are currently in short supply in the market. Farmer Liu Zhen brought his own pears and hawthorns to Beijing for sale for the first time in August and made money. Subsequently, he ran to Tong County and took advantage of the loophole in the Tong County market that allowed free purchase of cotton, purchased a batch of cotton and sold it in Beijing, and also sprayed water on the cotton to cheat, resulting in a profit of 30 cents per jin of cotton. He also used acquaintances as "middlemen" to intercept brooms halfway, earning two yuan for one hundred brooms just by talking. He also hired people in Beijing to line up to buy iron wire, buying it for 93 cents per jin and selling it back in his hometown for 1.70 yuan to 2.00 yuan per jin. Farmer Yang Feng from Jixian County specializes in "middleman" trading. Once, he transferred more than 6,000 jin of starch, making a profit of one cent per jin, and earning 60 yuan in a short time. According to a comrade from the Farmers' Service Center, "Currently, the farmers living in the Farmers' Service Center have gradually become interested in operating businesses and are unwilling to return to agricultural production. Many farmers say, "You can't earn so much money doing any work in the production cooperative, and you still suffer." The number of farmers staying at the service center has been increasing. The dormitory, which can only accommodate 1,400 people, now has 500 more people, and even the dining hall and conference room are full of guests. Many people stay for one to two months. The service center's monthly supply of more than 30,000 jin of grain is not enough to eat. There are so many carts that there is no place to put them."

    Why has this chaotic situation arisen in the Beijing Chaoyangmen free market? According to my understanding, the fundamental reason is that the relevant departments in Beijing have not strengthened their leadership over the free market, adopting a laissez-faire attitude. A comrade from the Dongdan District Commercial Section told me, "The current situation in the free market is very chaotic and complicated. It's not that we don't want to manage it, but we don't know how to manage it. The higher authorities have not given any instructions." A comrade from a stall association group also said, "We can't manage farmers coming to the city to do business." The staff of the Farmers' Service Center also encounter many difficulties in their work, and are very distressed, hoping that the higher authorities will give specific instructions and help. Comrades from the Beijing Municipal Commercial Leadership Department told me two weeks ago, "We have conducted research on the management of the free market, and we will be able to formulate a plan soon, and we also plan to establish a free market management committee in each district." However, until now, there has not even been a hint of movement.

### 一个没有领导的自由市场

    一个没有领导的自由市场
    本报记者　艾玲
    几个月以前，北京朝阳门行人道旁只有一个卖菜小摊，其余都是卖大饼、卖早点的。过了上午，街上就显得很清静了。自从开放自由市场以后，朝阳门附近就像个集镇似的，从早到晚都很热闹。每天清晨，人们就推着装满蔬菜、水产的小车，成群结队地从朝阳门外涌进来。小车和小摊摆满了朝阳门和朝内大街市场附近，有时还再向西发展，摆到东四牌楼附近。
    最初，人们很赞扬这个自由市场，感到比过去方便得多了。有的说：“我很久没买到这种活鱼啦！现在送上门来了。”有的说：“这青菜比国营零售店的青菜新鲜，又让我挑选，价钱也合适。”市场上的商品品种也很多。
    可是，渐渐地，市场上出现了一种不正常的气氛。
    现在，在市场上出售的，除了国家允许自由买卖的商品外，还出现了应当由国家统购和统一掌握的花生、芝麻、棉花、猪肉……。甚至连沾满灰尘的熟猪肉、驴肉等也都出现了。
    人们对市场上的商品的价格，也渐渐地不满起来了。国营零售公司出售的猪肉每斤七角八分，猪油每斤九角多。自由市场上出售的猪肉（带骨头的），每斤要九角到一元二角，猪油每斤一元六角到二元；狗肉也要卖六角一斤。葱、蒜的零售价比牌价高一倍以上，并且只许顾客买整捆的，不能零买。许多顾客一问价钱便摇摇头说：“太贵了！”市场上也常常发生争吵的事情。一个老大爷买了三斤猪肉，拿回来一秤，只有二斤半，就去同卖肉的吵起来。一个青年妇女和一个卖棉花的吵架，说棉花里面是湿的，要退货。
    自由市场上商品价格的混乱，也影响到国营商业部门对整个市场价格的掌握。12月19日那天，朝阳门外的农民服务所门口，堆着十几万斤大葱，像一座小山。这些葱，是山东泰安县临汶区马庄乡第一高级农业社由火车运来的。农业社事前没有同北京蔬菜公司联系，现在也不打算把葱卖给蔬菜公司。山东省每斤葱售价二分到四分，现在他们要以每斤一角五分售给小摊贩。自由市场上葱的价格，已经比国营零售价高出一倍以上了。这十几万斤大葱卖出去以后，势必更引起市场价格的混乱。消费者也就会更不满意了。自由市场上商品价格的混乱，也影响了国营公司的收购工作。现在，郊区许多农业生产社，宁可违反“合同”，不把菜卖给蔬菜公司，用高价出售给推小车的商贩。有些菜摊贩，为了追求高利，竟藏起摊贩牌照，化装成“农民”，推小车到郊区采购蔬菜。
    市场上还有很多小贩，大多是从农村来的农民。他们白天做买卖，晚上回到朝阳门外的农民服务所里睡觉，有的住客店或露宿街头巷尾。进城做买卖的农民，并不是都赚了钱的；有的因为不了解市场情况，带着很大的盲目性，结果连本钱也赔上了。一个石家庄的老汉，听说北京橘子很缺，零售价高，便贩运了一批橘子到北京出卖，每斤想卖六角或七角一斤（原价每斤三角多）。谁料他到了北京，到处都有橘子卖，价钱也没超过三角一斤，结果只得赔钱出售橘子。他只好坐在东四牌楼路旁低泣。许多农民进城做买卖，往往超过农民贸易的范围。据朝阳门农民服务所一个月的统计，在一千零七十三人中，有一半以上是专做投机生意的。许多农民空手进城，住在城里用高价收购、半途截购的方法，倒卖目前市场上供不应求的商品。农民刘真，在8月间第一次带了自产的梨、红果进北京销售，赚了钱。随后，他便跑到通县去，利用通县市场上允许自由购买棉花的空子，购进一批棉花到北京贩卖，还在棉花上喷水作弊，结果每斤棉花赚了三角钱。他还利用熟悉的人做“中间人”，半途截购笤帚，动动嘴，一百个笤帚就赚了二元。他还在北京雇人排队套购铁丝，买的九角三分一斤，回到乡间卖一元七角到二元一斤。从蓟县来的农民杨凤，专做“中间人”的买卖。一次，转手淀粉六千多斤，每斤获利一分钱，一会儿就赚了六十元。据农民服务所的一位同志谈：“目前住在农民服务所里的农民，已逐渐对经营商业发生兴趣，而不愿回去从事农业生产了。许多农民说：“在生产合作社里干哪个活也赚不了这么多钱，还受累。”住服务所的农民已越来越多。只能容纳一千四百人的宿舍，现在已多住了五百人，连饭堂、会议室也都住满了客人。许多人一住就是一个月到两个月。服务所每月供应三万多斤粮食也不够吃。小车多得没有地方放。
    北京朝阳门自由市场上为什么产生了这种混乱情况？据我了解，根本原因是北京市有关部门没有加强对自由市场的领导，抱着放任不管的态度。东单区商业科的同志告诉我：“目前自由市场的情况很混乱，很复杂。我们不是不愿管，而是不知道该怎样管。上级也没有一个指示。”一个摊商联合小组的同志也说：“对农民进城做买卖我们管不了。”农民服务所的工作人员，在工作中也遇到不少困难，很苦恼，希望上级给以具体指示和帮助。北京市商业领导部门的同志，在前两星期曾对我说：“关于自由市场的管理问题，我们已进行了研究，很快就可以订出方案，还准备每区成立自由市场管理委员会。”可是，直到现在，还连一点儿动静也没有。
