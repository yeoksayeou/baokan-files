Xinhua News Agency, December 14th: The Italian Communist Party's newspaper "l'Unità" published on November 19th an abstract of the speech made by the General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Togliatti, at the Bologna Provincial Communist Party Congress.

    Estimate of the Development of the Hungarian Events
    Togliatti said when talking about the development of the Hungarian events:
    …"In our view, the Hungarian event can be said to be a very serious, distressing and poignant thing. Comrade Tito recently gave a speech on these developments. In this speech, some arguments are consistent with our views, while on other issues, our estimates are more cautious and prudent…"
    Togliatti then said: "We cannot make a final judgment on the current Hungarian government; but we oppose hasty, self-righteous judgments, which we often see in the socialist newspapers, unfortunately. We understand that some people are in a very difficult situation, and they are trying their best to cope with a situation that may not be their fault. These people are certainly bearing a heavy responsibility at the moment. We respect these people, we wish them success, and we wish them to complete the tasks they have undertaken…
    "Regarding the previous Hungarian government, our judgment is mostly consistent with that of Comrade Tito. That is to say, this government, which was formed too late, was not good at grasping the situation, its actions were hesitant and wavering, and it made false statements, so that it could only make the situation deteriorate sharply, thus opening the way for the victory of counter-revolutionary forces…"
    Speaking of the first intervention, Togliatti recalled that our party said at the time that this was a distressing fact, and it would be best if the Hungarian Labor People's Party could cope with the situation that had been created without resorting to the intervention of foreign troops. We then reiterated our view that such intervention could and should have been avoided, and the fact of intervention should mainly be the responsibility of the confusion that occurred in the ranks of the Hungarian Communist Party.
    On the other hand, we openly admitted from the beginning that since things had developed to this point, the second intervention was unavoidable and strictly necessary, necessary not only because of the situation formed in Hungary, but also because of the impact that these events and foreseeable developments might have on the situation throughout Europe and the world.
    The developments in recent days have confirmed that our attitude is correct.
    We hope that the situation of Soviet troops remaining in Hungary can be ended as soon as possible; we believe that this hope we express not only conforms to the wishes of our ranks, but also conforms to the wishes of the most outstanding part of the Italian people who have agreed with our attitude in the past and now.
    As for the roots of the developments, especially the riots on October 23rd and 24th, Togliatti affirmed this judgment: the decisive reason lies in the mistakes made by the Hungarian leaders in recent months, especially in the fact that the Hungarian Labor People's Party completely disintegrated; and this situation was caused either because the leaders did not complete the actions necessary to correct the errors of the political line, or because a split movement and struggle against the leaders arose from the lower levels.
    The reactionary forces took the opportunity to infiltrate the cracks created in this way, and the situation was thus chaotic. This dangerous situation made the second intervention of the Soviet army necessary. In the initial period, it is true that there were workers and people's forces on both sides of the confrontation, but the participation of workers' forces is not enough to make a movement revolutionary, because, in order to be revolutionary, these forces must be led by a targeted revolutionary force.
    Therefore, we hope that the comrades of other communist parties, especially the comrades of the people's democratic countries, will allow us, who are surrounded by enemies in all aspects, never to abandon the above views when the events are so serious and the enemies are still more or less openly intervening, trying to strike at the socialist system. We must reiterate in any case: the decisive factor in these developments is the mistakes made by the leaders of the Hungarian Communist Party, the delay in reducing errors, and the delay in efforts to correct them. And these errors are mostly—though not all—the errors revealed by the 20th Congress of the CPSU, which raised a series of new issues to the workers and communist movement around the world.
    Especially in the people's democratic countries, people should democratize the internal life of the party and state organizations, establish better links between the working masses and the party leaders, and follow the national road of building socialism in each country, so as to meet the needs that appear in different forms in each country.
    In this regard, serious mistakes were made, especially in Hungary. These errors should be quickly clarified and corrected. What are the reasons for this delay? We will have the opportunity to talk about this in more detail at the National Congress, but we can say now: if anyone has prevented or restrained the correction of errors, then this person or these people should not only be criticized, but should also be punished.
    Attitude towards the criticism made by the 20th Congress of the CPSU
    The Soviet comrades showed great courage in openly starting a process of profound criticism and revision at the 20th Congress. We have not only expressed our approval, but as a communist party, we have been at the forefront of the international communist movement in striving to deepen criticism and draw all conclusions. To this end, we have made critical comments to the Soviet comrades, which we still fully retain.
    However, we believe that if there has been a mistake after the 20th Congress, this mistake was made by those who believed that it was enough for the Congress to make criticisms, and that these criticisms could be treated as ordinary administrative measures, without drawing a series of specific conclusions from these criticisms to determine a better policy, and to more correctly guide the actions of not only the communist parties that are not in power, but especially those that are already leading the whole society.
    What has made it easier for our party to engage in this action is the fact that since the end of the Second World War, our party has been most concerned with not allowing its political line to be dictated by external instructions, but with perfecting the planning and implementation of its actions based on the situation in our country. This is the case both in terms of the general political movement, in terms of the demands of life put forward at certain times, and in terms of how to organize the party itself in coordination with the development of the labor masses movement.
    The courage shown by the Soviet comrades at the 20th Congress makes us believe that this courage will certainly be conducive to correcting the mistakes made by all communist parties in leadership.
    There should be no retreat in the face of the criticisms made at the 20th Congress. As for our party, we will strive to avoid taking a step back in determining the political line based on the criticisms made at the 20th Congress. To the other parties, we want to say:
  “Friends, we understand the arduousness of your task, we want to appeal to your leaders to consider the responsibilities they bear to the people and the world's workers' movement. Their task is to thoroughly study the criticisms of the 20th Congress, draw all conclusions from them, trust the working class and the people's forces, and move forward boldly, but do not allow anyone to weaken the party when taking these actions."
    After saying this, Togliatti pointed out that it is necessary to remind the party and the entire Italian people's movement of a very serious mistake, namely: forgetting the serious and sometimes shocking issues that are directly related to the Italian people and the peoples of European countries because of the serious Hungarian events.
    About the relationship between the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party
    After talking about the situation in Egypt, Togliatti talked about the position taken by the Socialists.
    …"Speaking of the new reactionary wave launched by the Catholic political party in Italy, we should call on the masses of people to raise their vigilance. In order to stop this reactionary wave, it is necessary to unite all democratic forces to launch a great people's movement. Therefore, we must forcefully and persistently re-propose the issue of the unity of the working class. As everyone knows, a significant difference of opinion has been shown between us and the Socialist comrades on the Hungarian issue. We have no blame to put forward in this regard, because regardless of the judgment, the two positions can be compared. We are precisely asking the Socialist comrades not to give up the way of comparing and discussing in a friendly manner. On the contrary, some people do not engage in discussion, but take the form of slanderous assertions, for example, the Socialist comrade Catani de Ferrara asserted that the Communist comrades plagiarize group policies, and therefore they are slaves to this policy.
    "This is a blatant violation of the facts. There are also some people who are full of worries, because we Communists are supposedly isolated due to our attitude towards the Hungarian events. They say: Comrade Nanni—I don't know out of what sense of humor—has asked us to follow the example of the Swiss Communist Party and the Danish Communist Party.
    "From the very beginning, we realized that our situation was difficult. However, we are faced with some facts that make people feel comforted: not only is our party fully united internally, but many aspects have expressed their solidarity with us, people recognize that our position is upright, and recognize that because we say what should be said, we are good at coping with difficulties even in difficult times.
    "As for Nanni asking us to follow the example of some other communist parties, we believe that we can point out to the fraternal parties with full respect: our great organization, which is loyal to principles and connected with the masses of the people, can still be regarded as an example."…
    Togliatti then talked about the attitude of the Socialist Lombardy. Lombardy advocated launching an action within the Communist Party to make the Socialist position dominant within the Communist Party because of the Hungarian events.…
    "This position will only interest us if it can promote a comparison between the unity and consolidation within the two parties. However, on the other hand, given the degree of development that the workers' movement has now reached, this position has a principled value for the workers' movement.
    "What is actually being proposed here is the question of the possibility of the simultaneous existence of several working-class parties advocating socialism in one country.
    "We Communists have overcome the tendency to deny this possibility, but, precisely because of this, we believe that we cannot circumvent the issue of the relationship between these parties. It is not enough to simply say that we are two political parties, and therefore we are in the tide of rural and factory struggles, and we feel the emotion of class unity—it is not enough to simply say that. No, this is not enough, because this is precisely a way of taking refuge in the old maximalist program, that is to say, a way of satisfying ourselves with words. If we accept Lombardy's opinion, this would mean that as long as there are two parties within the working class, these two parties must engage in fratricidal struggles every time there is a difference of opinion on a certain issue; these two parties must constantly take actions aimed at infiltrating each other, seizing the electorate, destroying each other, and weakening each other.
    "Obviously, an attitude like this can only be an attitude of stubborn sectarianism, and its purpose is to exclude the possibility of the simultaneous existence of different parties of the working class.
    "If there are different parties existing simultaneously like in our country, then they should not attack each other or destroy each other, but should establish different forms of relationship between them with the degree of development of the situation and the workers' movement."

### 在意共波伦亚省代表大会上  陶里亚蒂谈匈牙利事态发展等问题

    在意共波伦亚省代表大会上
    陶里亚蒂谈匈牙利事态发展等问题
    新华社14日讯：意大利共产党机关报“团结报”11月19日刊载了意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂在波伦亚省共产党代表大会上发表的演说的摘要。
    对匈牙利事态发展的估计
    陶里亚蒂在谈到匈牙利事态发展的时候说：
    ……“在我们看来，匈牙利事件可以说是非常严重、令人痛心和辛酸的事情。铁托同志最近就这些事态发展发表了演说。在这篇演说中，有些论点是同我们的看法一致的，而在另一些问题上，我们的估计则比较持重和审慎……”
    陶里亚蒂接着说：“对于匈牙利现政府，我们不能下最后的判断；但是我们反对仓卒的、自以为是的判断，不幸我们往往看见社会党报刊上出现许多这类判断。我们了解：有些人处于一种非常局势之中，他们正在尽力设法应付也许不是由于他们的过失而造成的局势。这些人目前肯定地担负着沉重的责任。我们尊重这些人，我们祝他们成功，祝他们完成他们所承担的任务……
    “关于匈牙利前届政府，我们的判断大部分同铁托同志作的判断是一致的。就是说，这个组成得太晚的政府不善于掌握局势，它的行动犹豫不决、摇摆不定，而且它发表虚伪的声明，以致只能使局势急转直下，从而为反革命势力取得胜利的危险开辟了道路……”
    讲到第一次干涉，陶里亚蒂追述说，我们党当时立即说过，这是一个令人痛心的事实，最好是匈牙利劳动人民党能够应付已造成的局势而不求助于外国军队的干涉。我们接着重申了我们的看法：这种干涉是能够而且应该避免的，干涉的事实主要应由匈牙利共产党队伍中发生的混乱情况负责。
    另一方面，我们从一开始就公开承认：既然事情已经发展到这种地步，第二次干涉就是不可避免的严格的必要的了，所以必要，不仅是由于在匈牙利形成的局势，而且也是由于这些事件以及可以预见到的发展可能对整个欧洲和全世界的局势产生的影响。
    最近几天的事态发展已经证实我们的态度是正确的。
    我们希望人们能从速结束苏联军队留在匈牙利的局面；我们相信我们表示的这种希望不仅符合我们队伍的意愿，而且也符合过去和现在都赞成我们的态度的意大利人民最优秀部分的意愿。
    至于事态发展、特别是10月23日和24日暴动的根源，陶里亚蒂肯定了这样的判断：决定性的原因在于匈牙利领袖们在最近几个月中所犯的错误，特别在于这一事实：匈牙利劳动人民党完全瓦解了；而造成这种情况，或是因为领袖们没有完成纠正错误的政治路线所必需的行动，或是因为从下层产生了反对领袖们的分裂运动和斗争。
    反动势力乘机渗入这样造成的裂口，局势就此混乱了。这种充满危险的局势使得苏联军队第二次进行干涉成为必要。在最初一个时期，对峙的双方都有工人和人民的力量，这是千真万确的，但是有工人力量参加不足以使一个运动具有革命性质，因为，要具有革命性质，这些力量必须由一个有目标的革命力量来领导。
    因此，我们希望其他共产党的同志们，特别是希望人民民主国家的同志们，允许我们这些在各方面都被敌人包围的人，在事件如此严重而且敌人还在或多或少地公开插手活动，试图做到打击社会主义制度的时候，决不放弃上述看法。我们无论如何要重申：这些事态发展中的决定性因素是匈牙利共产党领袖们所犯的错误，迟迟不减少错误，迟迟不努力加以纠正。而这些错误大部分——虽然不是全部——正是向全世界工人和共产主义运动提出了一系列新问题的苏共第二十次代表大会所揭露的错误。
    尤其是在人民民主国家，人们应该进行党和国家组织内部生活的民主化，建立劳动群众和党的领袖们之间的更好的联系，在每一个国家内都遵循建设社会主义的民族道路，从而满足在每一个国家以不同形式出现的需要。
    在这方面，特别是在匈牙利，犯了严重的错误。应该迅速弄清楚并且纠正这些错误。这种拖延的原因何在呢？对于这个问题，我们在全国代表大会上将有机会比较详尽地谈谈，不过，我们现在就可以说：假如有人阻止了或束缚了纠正错误，那么，这个人或这些人不仅应该受到批评，而且应该受到惩处。
    对苏共二十次代表大会所作的批评的态度
    苏联同志们表现出很大的勇气在第二十次代表大会上公开开始了一个深刻的批判和修正的过程。我们不仅已经表示赞同，而且作为共产党，我们在努力使批评深入和得出一切结论方面，已经在国际共产主义运动中位于前列。为此，我们曾经向苏联同志提出我们现在还完全保留的批判性意见。
    但是，我们认为：假如说第二十次代表大会之后有过一个错误，这个错误就是这样的一些人犯的：他们认为只需这个代表大会提出批评就行了，可以把这些批评当作普通的行政措施，而不必从这些批评中得出一系列具体结论来确定更好的方针，来更正确地领导不仅是没有当政的、而且特别是已经领导着全社会的共产党的行动。
    在从事这种行动的时候，使我们党得到方便的是这一事实：自从第二次世界大战结束以来，我们党最为关心的始终是不让自己的政治路线听从外来的指示，而是要完善地依据我国情况来规划和开展它的行动。无论在总的政治运动方面，在某些时际提出的生活要求方面，还是在如何配合劳动群众运动发展来组织党本身方面，都是这样。
    苏联同志在第二十次代表大会上表现出的勇气使我们相信：这种勇气必定有利于纠正所有的共产党在领导方面所犯的错误。
    不应该在第二十次代表大会所作出的批评面前退却。至于我们党，我们将力求避免在根据第二十次代表大会所提出的批评来确定政治路线方面退后一步。对于其他的党，我们要说：
  “朋友，我们理解你们任务的艰巨，我们要吁请你们的领导人考虑他们对人民和世界工人运动所负的责任。他们的任务是彻底研究第二十次代表大会的批评，从中得出一切结论，信任工人阶级和人民力量，大胆前进，然而在采取这些行动的时候不要让人削弱党。”
    这样说了之后，陶里亚蒂指出必须向党和整个意大利人民运动提醒一个十分严重的错误，即：由于严重的匈牙利事件而忘记了同意大利人民和欧洲各国人民直接有关的那些严重的、有时是惊心动魄的问题。
    关于意共和社会党之间的关系
    在谈到埃及局势以后，陶里亚蒂讲到社会党人采取的立场。
    ……“说到天主教政党在意大利发动的新的反动浪潮，我们应当号召人民群众提高警惕。为了制止这一反动浪潮，必须团结一切民主力量来发动一个伟大的人民运动。因此，我们要有力地、坚持不懈地再度提出工人阶级团结的问题。大家知道，在我们和社会党同志之间在匈牙利问题上表现了一种显著的意见分歧。我们在这方面没有什么责备要提出，因为不管判断如何，两种立场是可以加以比较的。我们正是要要求社会党同志们不要放弃以友好态度来加以比较和讨论的方式。相反，却有人不进行讨论，而采取诽谤性断言的方式，例如社会党同志卡塔尼·德斐拉拉断言：共产党同志抄袭集团政策，因此他们是这种政策的奴隶。
    “这是公然违反事实的。还有些人满怀忧虑，因为我们共产党人由于我们对于匈牙利事件的态度而据说是陷于孤立。他们说：南尼同志——我不知道是出于什么幽默感——已经请我们效法瑞士共产党和丹麦共产党的榜样。
    “早在一开始，我们就认识到：我们的处境是困难的。但是，我们面对着一些使人感到慰籍的事实：不仅我们党内部充分团结，而且好些方面对我们表示了声援，人们承认我们立场严正，承认我们因为说出应该说的事情，所以即使在艰巨的时刻也善于应付困难。
    “至于南尼请我们效法其他一些共产党，我们相信可以对兄弟党满怀敬意地指出：我们这个忠于原则的、联系人民群众的伟大组织，仍然可以被当作榜样。”……
    陶里亚蒂然后谈到社会党人龙巴迪的态度。龙巴迪由于匈牙利事件而主张在共产党内部发动一种行动来使得社会党立场在共产党内占优势。……
    “这种立场只有在能够促使就两党之内的团结和巩固比较一番的情况下才会使我们感兴趣。不过，从另一方面来说，鉴于工人运动现在达到的发展程度，这种立场对于工人运动倒具有一种原则性的价值。
    “这里提出来的实际上是在一个国家内几个主张社会主义的工人阶级政党同时存在的可能性的问题。
    “我们共产党人已经克服了否认这种可能性的倾向，但是，正因为如此，我们认为不能规避这些党之间的关系问题。仅仅说我们是两个政党，因而处于农村和工厂斗争的潮流之中，我们感到阶级团结的感情——仅仅这样说是不够的。不，这是不够的，因为这正是一种以旧的最高纲领主义为避难所的办法，就是说，满足于言词的办法。如果接受龙巴迪的意见，这就意味着：只要工人阶级内部存在着两个党，这两个党之间每逢对某个问题意见分歧的时候就一定得进行手足相残的斗争；这两个党就非得经常采取旨在渗入对方、夺取选民群众、互相破坏、互相削弱的行动不可。
    “很明显，像这样的态度，只能是顽固的宗派主义的态度，它的目的就在于排斥工人阶级不同政党同时存在的可能性。
    “假如像我国这样有这样的不同政党同时存在，那末它们就不应该互相打击、互相破坏，而是应该随着局势和工人运动发展的程度而在它们之间建立形式不同的关系。”
