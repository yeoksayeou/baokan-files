Specifications and Prices

When buying and selling goods, one cannot avoid paying attention to specifications. The specifications of a commodity should be a measure of fair trade. However, some staff members of state-owned commercial institutions have a very casual attitude towards specifications. The specifications are not accurately defined when they are established, and they are even more lacking in standards when they are applied. The same commodity may have strict specifications when purchased, but loose specifications when sold; strict specifications when there is a surplus of products, and loose specifications when there is a shortage of products.

Despite the state's correct price policy, can we really talk about correctly implementing the price policy if the specifications of commodities are handled so unreasonably? Those who think that they can fool producers simply because they have the power to set specifications should understand that doing so is neither conducive to the development of production, nor is it conducive to completing procurement tasks.

    规格和价格
    买卖商品，少不了要讲究规格。商品的规格应该是公平交易的一种尺度。但是，有些国营商业机构的工作人员对待规格的态度却很随便。规定规格标准的时候，就规定得不准确，掌握它的时候，更是漫无标准。同样的商品，收购的时候对规格掌握得紧，出售的时候对规格掌握的松；产品多的时候对规格掌握得紧，产品少的时候对规格掌握得松。
    尽管国家有正确的价格政策，可是，如果在商品规格的掌握上很不合理，那还能谈得上正确地执行价格政策吗？那些以为规定规格的大权在握，就可以随便糊弄生产者的人应该懂得：这样做，既不利于发展生产，难道能够有利于完成采购任务吗？
