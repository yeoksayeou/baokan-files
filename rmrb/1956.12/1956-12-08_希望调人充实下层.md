After full collectivization, agricultural production work has become more complex and arduous, but the number of cadres directly leading agricultural production work has been greatly reduced, which is obviously very unreasonable.

	Hoping to Transfer Personnel to Strengthen the Lower Levels
	Lin Wei

	Half a Year Without Doing "Proper Work"
	In October, when I was in Tai'an County, Shandong, the Party Secretary of the County Committee once joked in a casual conversation that he felt he hadn't done any "proper work" in the past six months. His explanation of "proper work" was: to calm down and live in the countryside, among the cadres and farmers, and properly organize and lead everyone to do an important task from beginning to end (of course, the most important task at this stage is to run agricultural cooperatives well, increase farmers' income, increase social wealth, and at the same time complete the state's plan for purchasing agricultural products). He said that he and other comrades of the County Committee sometimes went to the countryside to take a look, but rarely could they go as deep as they used to. The main reason is that county-level organs and departments within the organs are constantly increasing, and each department invariably requires the County Committee to greatly strengthen its leadership over the department. The number of meetings and documents from various departments increases day by day. Every time someone from a department returns from a meeting above, they ask the County Committee to hold a meeting to listen to the transmission, and every time an instruction comes, they ask the County Committee to discuss and deploy it. As a result, the County Committee spends a lot of time at home holding meetings and rarely has time to go to the countryside.

	The Number of People Leading Cooperatives Has Been Greatly Reduced
	After transferring from Tai'an County, Shandong, to Huixian County, Henan, I found that there was a similar, perhaps even bigger, problem there—the number of ordinary cadres who regularly reside in the countryside to guide the central work and agricultural cooperative activities has also been greatly reduced.

	The comrades of the work team dispatched by the Huixian County Party Committee to the Huqiao Central Township told me that before last year, this central township belonged to the Tenth District. The district had a total of twenty-four cadres who regularly guided work in various townships and villages. Among them, ten were district-level cadres (members of the District Party Committee and the head and deputy heads of the district, etc.), and fourteen were general cadres. After the districts were abolished and divided into two central townships, the area of land under their leadership was the same, but the number of cadres who regularly guided work in the countryside was reduced to eight, including three district-level cadres and five general cadres. That is to say, two-thirds of the original people left, leaving only one-third. The Huqiao Central Township includes three townships, with a total of nineteen administrative villages and more than 4,000 peasant households, forming eight large agricultural cooperatives, each averaging more than 500 households. However, the work team has a total of only four people, including district-level cadres and general cadres. The general cadres, as mentioned here, include inexperienced young people who have just left production. It is really difficult for them to solve all kinds of complex problems in the countryside.

	Regarding the situation of the eight agricultural cooperatives, the comrades of the work team said that five cooperatives had increased production, one cooperative had neither increased nor decreased, and two cooperatives had reduced production, including the Qingxiafo Cooperative, which had reduced production by 44%, and the Silukou Cooperative, which had reduced production by 10%. The reasons for the reduction in production, objectively speaking, were that there was too much rain and flooding. Subjectively speaking, the Party organization lacked specific leadership over the agricultural cooperative's production. The summer harvest was a clear example: the wheat grew very well, but when it was about to be harvested, it rained heavily for more than ten days, and the water flooded the fields. After the rain, each village needed someone to immediately organize the farmers to drain the water and rescue the crops. However, with only four people to guide the nineteen administrative villages (eight cooperatives), they simply couldn't handle it. The Qingxiafo Cooperative and the nearby Xiaozhuang Cooperative, including six villages and more than 1,100 peasant households, had only one district cadre to run around. They couldn't attend to everything and actually abandoned the Qingxiafo Cooperative. As a result, the members of this cooperative were unable to exert the collective strength, the drainage and rescue work was not done well, and 40% of the wheat was moldy (cooperatives with leadership had less than 20% moldy wheat). In this cooperative alone, the state collected 120,000 catties less grain. It goes without saying that the members suffered hardship.

	Where did the original two-thirds of the cadres from the Tenth District of Huixian County go? It is said that some went to various sections of the county government (some have been expanded into bureaus), some went to the food company, some went to the Xinhua Bookstore, and some went to the supply and marketing cooperative (these tasks are important, but is it right to draw away cadres who lead the central work?)… In short, they have all left the posts of leading the cooperative movement and leading collective production.

	The situation in Huqiao Central Township is not the only exception. On November 10, when I visited the Huixian County Party Committee, several secretaries and members of the County Committee and comrades from the Rural Work Department said that the number of cadres directly leading agricultural cooperatives in the countryside has now been greatly reduced. They told me that in the first few years after liberation, the number of staff members who were detached from production in Huixian County was about 500, and most of these people worked in the countryside. Just counting the district cadres of the ten districts, there were about 250 in total. Adding the personnel who frequently went to the countryside from the county, almost every village in the county's 350 administrative villages had a dedicated person responsible for leadership. Everyone believed that the relationship between the Party and the peasant masses was close at that time, and the Party's leadership over rural work was strong and effective. Even last year, when there were only small agricultural cooperatives with three or twenty households everywhere, almost every cooperative had a dedicated person responsible for regular guidance, so problems were solved more timely and thoroughly, and production was organized more orderly. However, this year, when almost all peasants have joined the cooperatives, and the peasants in the whole county have become 198 large cooperatives with hundreds of households each, urgently needing the Party to specifically lead and organize large-scale production, the number of cadres who regularly lead cooperatives directly in the countryside has been reduced to the lowest number in history—only 66 work team members dispatched by the County Party Committee to various central townships. Adding the personnel who go to the countryside from the county, it is probably difficult to reach 100 people regularly. Recently, I heard that the work team has been abolished, and all 20 townships in the county have dispatched the original district cadres to serve as township heads and Party branch secretaries; in addition, the mountainous areas of the county have retained the establishment of three districts, with a total of about 30 people; and there are also about ten inspectors in the county. It is said that the total number of cadres who regularly lead cooperatives in the township has reached 102. Compared with the first few years after liberation, this number is still less than half, or even less than one-third. And now the total number of staff members detached from production in the whole county is 1,800 (more than two and a half times the original 500 people).

	Many Problems Cannot Be Solved Without Help
	Through the cooperative movement in the past few years, many capable cooperative managers have emerged in the countryside, who can organize collective production labor very well. Therefore, Huixian County has achieved great success in farmland water conservancy and other basic construction this year, increasing the county's paddy fields from 260,000 mu to 480,000 mu. However, because all cooperatives have expanded from dozens of households to hundreds of households at once, rural cadres have shown insufficient experience, and many pressing problems that need to be solved, such as labor organization and division of labor, work calculation (calculating labor), cannot be solved. This has formed a kind of chaos, especially in large cooperatives. Some agricultural cooperatives have two or three thousand households, spanning ten miles from north to south, with several villages combined together. The daily production activities of the peasants require the cooperative cadres to "instruct," but the cooperative cadres cannot get regular help from the upper-level cadres, the production organization is not good, and as a result, many cooperatives have reduced production. Sanjiaokou used to be a surplus grain cooperative, but this year it has become a grain deficient cooperative. The Nancun large cooperative with more than 2,400 households also reduced production this year. Among the 56 disaster-stricken cooperatives in the county, 20 cooperatives did not reduce production after rescue; the remaining 36 cooperatives were not organized for rescue, or the rescue was not timely, resulting in reduced production. It is said that there are also cooperatives that have reduced production even though they have not been affected by disasters.

	This problem seems to be the responsibility of the County Party Committee, but the County Party Committee cannot be fully responsible. Every system and department has a prescribed number of staff members from above. According to the establishment, each system and department has the right to have the existing or even more staff members. According to the statistics of 19 systems in the financial and trade departments of Huixian County, the current number of people is more than 900, and according to the establishment, it is more than 1,400, still short of about 500 people. Just to meet the establishment quota of the financial and trade departments, even if all the existing district cadres leading agricultural cooperativization work were drawn away, it would still be short of 400 people.

	The County Committee members told me that sometimes the higher authorities also send some people to the countryside to inspect and help work, to understand the situation and problems in the countryside, but only to understand, not to solve. The problems in the villages and cooperatives, big and small, remain the same. However, because the various systems above often come to ask for this and that kind of material, it forms a heavy burden on the lower levels. It is said that two or three cadres in each township are often struggling to deal with the higher authorities and have no time to work among the masses.

	The county head of Xinxiang also talked to me about the situation of rural leadership. From all aspects, the problems of these two neighboring counties are very similar.

	Hoping to Transfer Personnel to Strengthen the Lower Levels
	Comrade Geng Qichang, Secretary of the Xinxiang Prefectural Committee, also felt the same way about this issue. He said: In the first and second crucial years after full collectivization, it is entirely appropriate to transfer a large number of cadres from the central organs and provincial and municipal organs to the countryside to lead cooperative production. Judging from the crowded situation of cadres in the higher-level organs, it is also possible to draw people out. He believes that the leading organs at the prefectural and even county levels, various systems, and various departments do not need as many people as they do now, and a large number can be drawn out to strengthen the lower levels and strengthen leadership over the countryside. He said: If all the personnel of the various systems are complete, but the agricultural cooperatives have reduced production and collapsed, everyone will still not be able to accomplish anything.

	I think these opinions are correct. The Soviet experience has long told us: eliminating the exploitative system and changing production relations is not the most difficult thing. This only requires smashing the old system. To organize the new economic life of hundreds of millions of people is a more difficult and complex task, which requires us to put in more effort. Judging from the rural situation in Huixian and other places, it seems that the opposite is true: we once used a lot of effort in organizing agricultural cooperatives (changing production relations); but when organizing collective production, some regions and some people are trying to put in very little effort.

	Many people in northern Henan said: "The Party's leadership over rural work has been weakened." This statement does not seem very scientific, because the Party's leadership over rural work includes many other contents besides equipping rural staff. However, the number and strength of rural staff, especially those who lead cooperatives, should not be regarded as a small matter. A reduction in production in a cooperative is a little "lesson" on paper for us, but for the peasants, it may mean not being able to eat enough, not being able to keep warm, not having salt to eat, not having coal to burn, and not being able to treat illnesses... Now the peasants rely on the cooperatives to solve all their difficulties, and happiness, suffering, and joy are all determined here. And we put in very little effort for such things, is this permissible?

	Cooperative agricultural production is superior to individual agricultural production, and advanced cooperative production is superior to elementary cooperative production. However, this superiority cannot be fully realized in any situation. To fully realize this superiority, we first need to mobilize many good organizers and leaders to deeply penetrate into agricultural production cooperatives and help solve practical problems at any time and anywhere.

    全面合作化以后，农业生产工作更复杂更繁重了，但是直接领导农业生产工作的干部反而大大减少了，显然，这是很不合理的。
    希望调人充实下层
    林韦
    半年没做“正经事”
    10月份我在山东泰安县的时候，党的县委书记有一次在闲谈中开玩笑说，他觉得自己半年来没有做什么“正经事”。他对“正经事”的解释是：沉下心来住在乡间，住在乡村的干部和农民中间，好好地组织和领导大家从头到尾做好一件重要的工作（当然，目前阶段最重要的工作莫过于办好农业合作社，使农民增加收入，社会增加财富，同时完成国家征购农产品的计划）。他说，他和其他的县委同志们有时候也下乡看看，但很少能像过去那样深入下去。原因主要是：县级机关和机关中的部门都在不断地增加，各个部门又都无例外地要求县委大力加强对这部门的领导。各部门的会议和文件一天天增多，每一个部门有人从上面开会回来都要求县委开会听传达，每一个指示来了都要求县委讨论布置，结果是县委把大量时间用于在家开会，很少能够抽身下乡了。
    领导办社的人大大减少了
    从山东泰安县转到河南辉县，我发现那儿也有类似的也许是更大的问题——经常驻在乡间指导中心工作、指导农业合作社活动的普通干部也大大减少了。
    辉县县委派驻胡桥中心乡的工作组的同志们告诉我，去年以前，这个中心乡属于第十区。这个区一共有二十四个干部经常在各乡各村指导工作。其中有十个是区级干部（党的区委委员和正副区长等），十四个是一般干部。撤区以后分成两个中心乡，领导的地片一样大，但经常在乡村指导工作的干部却减成了八个人，其中三个是区级干部，五个是一般干部。这就是说，原来的人有三分之二走了，只剩下三分之一。胡桥中心乡包括三个乡，共有十九个行政村，四千多农户，组成八个很大的农业合作社，每社平均五百多户。但这个工作组里区级干部加上一般干部一共只有四个人。这里所说的一般干部，包括刚刚脱离生产的没有经验的青年。要他们去解决农村中各种各样的复杂问题，实在是很困难的。
    关于八个农业合作社的情形，工作组同志们说是有五个社增产了，一个社不增不减，还有两个社减产了，其中清下佛社减产达44％。四路口社减产10％。减产的原因，从客观上说是下雨太多，遭了水灾。从主观上说，则是党组织，对农业合作社的生产缺少具体领导。夏收是一个明显的例子：小麦长得很好，可是临收割时大雨一连下了十多天，水淹了。雨后各村都需要马上有人去组织农民排水，抢救庄稼。可是，十九个行政村（八个社）只有四个人去指导，根本顾不过来。清下佛社和附近的小庄社，一共包括六个村，一千一百多农户，只有一个区干部去跑。顾此失彼，实际上扔了清下佛社。结果这个社的社员们没有能够发挥集体的力量，排水抢救工作没有作好，小麦有40％霉了
  （有领导的社发霉小麦都在20％以下）。仅这一个社，国家少征购粮食十二万斤。社员受的困难就不必说了。
    辉县第十区原来的三分之二的干部都哪儿去了呢？据说有的到了县府各科（有些已扩大成局），有的到了食品公司，有的到了新华书店，有的到了供销合作社（这些工作都是重要的，但是把领导中心工作的干部抽走是不是对的呢？）……总之，他们都离开了领导合作化运动和领导集体生产的岗位。
    胡桥中心乡的这种状况，并不是仅有的例外。11月10日我访问辉县县委会的时候，几个县委书记、委员和农村工作部的同志们都说，直接在乡间领导农业合作社的干部现在大大减少了。他们告诉我：在初解放的几年，辉县脱离生产的工作人员一共是五百人的样子，这些人大部分时间在乡间工作。仅计十个区的区干部，总共就有二百五十人左右。加上县里经常下乡的人员，全县三百五十个行政村，几乎村村都有专人负责领导。大家认为那时候党同农民群众的关系是密切的，党对农村工作的领导是坚强有力的。就是在去年，各处都只有一些三、二十户的小农业合作社的时候也几乎每社都有专人负责经常指导，所以解决问题比较及时而深入，生产也组织得比较有秩序。但是，在农民几乎全数入社，全县农民变成了一百九十八个各有数百户人家的大社，急切需要党来具体领导组织大生产的今年，经常在乡间直接领导办社的干部却减少到了历年来的最低数字——只剩了县委派驻各中心乡的六十六名工作队员。加上县里下乡的人员，恐怕也很难经常达到百人。最近，听说工作队取消，全县二十个乡都已派原来的区干部去当乡长和党支部书记；另外全县山区保留了三个区的编制，共有三十来人；县里还有十来个巡视员。经常在乡领导办社的干部据说总共达到了一百零二人。这个数目同解放初期几年相比，仍不及半数，甚至不及三分之一。而现在全县脱产工作人员总数却是一千八百人（等于原来五百人的二倍半还多）。
　  很多问题没人帮助解决
    经过过去几年的合作化运动，乡村中已经涌现出许多有能力的办社人员，能够很好地组织集体的生产劳动，所以辉县在农田水利等基本建设上今年取得了很大的成绩。使全县水田由过去的二十六万亩突增至四十八万亩。但是，由于所有的社都由数十户一下扩大到数百户，乡村干部都表现出经验不足，劳动组织和分工、计工（计算劳动）等许多迫切需要解决的问题不能解决，这就形成一种混乱，大社尤其混乱。有的农业社二、三千户，南北十来里，好些村庄合在一起，农民的日常生产活动都要求社干部来“吩咐”，而社干部得不到上面干部的经常帮助，生产组织不好，结果有不少社减产了。三交口过去是余粮社，今年成了缺粮社。二千四百多户的南村大社，今年也减产了。全县五十六个受灾社，有二十个社经抢救没有减产；其余三十六个社无人组织抢救，或抢救不及时，结果减了产。据说未受灾的社也有减产的。
    这问题似乎应该由县委负责，但县委不能完全负责。每一个系统和部门，都有上面规定的编制人数。依据编制，各系统各部门都有权拥有现有的以至更多的工作人员。辉县财贸部门十九个系统统计，现有人数是九百多名，按编制是一千四百多名，还缺五百名的样子。仅仅为了满足财贸部门的编制名额，就是把现有的领导农业合作化工作的区干部统统抽光，还缺四百名。
    县委们告诉我：上面有时候也派一些人到农村里来检查和帮助工作，了解农村的情况和问题，但只是了解，并不解决，村里社里大大小小的问题依然如故。而由于上面各系统经常来要这类那类的材料，反而对下面形成一种沉重的负担。据说各乡里都有两三个干部经常苦于应付上级，无暇到群众中去工作。
    新乡县长也同我谈过农村领导的情况。从各方面看，这两个紧邻县份的问题都是十分类似的。
  　希望调人充实下层
    新乡地委书记耿其昌同志对这问题也有同感。他说：像全面合作化以后第一、二年这样关键性的年头，就是从中央机关和省、市机关抽调大量干部下乡来领导合作生产，也完全应该。从上级机关干部拥挤的情况看，抽人也是可能的。他认为专区以至县级的领导机关，各系统，各部门，也并不需要现在那么多人，可以大批地抽出来充实下层，加强对农村的领导。他说：如果各系统人马都齐全了，而农业社都减产了、垮了，大家还是什么也干不成。
    这些意见，我以为是正确的。苏联的经验早就告诉我们：消灭剥削制度和改变生产关系并不是最困难的。这只要把旧的一套打碎就行了。要组织亿万人民的新的经济生活，这是一个更加困难和复杂的任务，需要我们付出更多的力量。从辉县等地的农村情况看，事情似乎是相反的：我们在组织农业合作社
  （改变生产关系）时曾经用了很大的力量；但组织集体生产的时候，有些地区和有些人却企图只付出很小的力量。
    豫北地区好些人说：“党对农村工作的领导削弱了。”这话似乎不大科学，因为党对农村工作的领导除了配备乡村工作人员以外，还有其他许多内容。但是乡村工作人员特别是领导办社人员的多少和强弱，确实不应当被看作小问题。一个社的减产，在我们是纸面上的一点“教训”，对农民却可能是意味着吃不饱，穿不暖，没盐吃，没煤烧，有病不能治……。现在农民一切困难都要靠社解决，祸福苦乐，都在这里决定。而我们对这样的事情只付出很小的力量，这是可以允许的么？
    合作化的农业生产比个体的农业生产优越，高级的合作生产比初级的合作生产优越。但是，这种优越性并不是在任何情况下都能充分发挥出来。要充分发挥这种优越性，首先需要调集很多很好的组织者和领导者，普遍地深入到农业生产合作社里，随时随地帮助解决实际问题。
