Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan – Seventy-plus private sector personnel with rich business experience from six industries in Wuhan, including aquatic and mountain produce, raw lacquer, bean-based sauces, traditional Chinese medicine, warehousing, and food, are collectively compiling their business experiences by industry.

This work of systematically organizing business experience began with Wang Fengzuo, a private sector employee in the seafood industry. Wang Fengzuo has been engaged in the seafood and grocery business for thirty or forty years and is very familiar with the varieties, specifications, consumption, and storage methods of seafood groceries, as well as procurement and sales. He invited five experienced private sector personnel in the same industry to jointly compile the "Compilation of Storage Methods for Seafood Groceries," which was published as a book by the Wuhan Federation of Industry and Commerce in November. In the aquatic and mountain produce and other industries, the "Compilation of Reference Materials for Procurement, Storage, Transportation, Processing, and Storage of Aquatic and Mountain Produce" compiled by Su Changlin and six others, and the "Compilation of Raw Lacquer Business" compiled by Fei Qiusheng and four others, have now been finalized. They respectively introduce the origin, quality, production season, procurement, storage, transportation, processing, and storage methods of one hundred and fifty-one kinds of aquatic and mountain produce, as well as the production overview, identification methods, and refining process of raw lacquer.
