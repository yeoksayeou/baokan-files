The Boiler-Tractor in Jin County's Rural Areas
Li Daoju, Engineer of Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Factory

To support agricultural cooperation, the Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Factory manufactured a batch of five-horsepower boiler-tractors and sent them to the countryside. Afterwards, we heard some feedback from the rural areas, but the opinions were very inconsistent. Some said the boiler-tractors were of good quality and even presented us with red flags; others said the quality was poor, and not only refused to pay but also demanded returns. To understand the true situation, the factory sent me, along with an inspector and two workers, to Jin County, Hebei, for a field investigation.

We spent eight days visiting five districts in Jin County, traveling more than 250 li, and inspecting a total of nineteen machines. We found that these machines had no problems and were of good quality. The main problem was that farmers lacked the technical skills to use the boiler-tractors.

When we arrived at the Yingli Township Agricultural Cooperative, the head of the cooperative and some of the members said to us, "This is a kowtow machine. Kowtowing to it won't make it as fast as a donkey pulling a waterwheel." We said we would help repair it if it was broken, but they said, "I don't think even a god can fix this machine." The cooperative not only didn't pay the supply and marketing cooperative for the boiler-tractor, but also demanded a return. Later, we spent three hours checking every part of the machine and found no damage. Then we started the fire. When the steam pressure reached seven kilograms, we turned on the machine, and the water brought up by the waterwheel overflowed from the water dam. At this time, dozens of men and women cooperative members watching cheered and jumped for joy. Some said, "Look! Ten big mules can't match it!" Others said, "It can irrigate at least fifty mu of land a day." Finally, everyone said, "The machines made by the worker brothers are really good, it's just that we don't know how to use them." We told them which parts of the boiler-tractor were prone to problems, what things to pay attention to when using the boiler-tractor, and taught them the firing techniques. When we left, the head of the agricultural cooperative wrote us a letter expressing his gratitude. Later, they paid the supply and marketing cooperative for the machine and said they would buy two more boiler-tractors next year.

This is just one example. The situation in other places was generally the same.

What inappropriate practices do farmers have in using boiler-tractors? According to our investigation this time, the most serious problem is firing. The head of the Houcheng Township Agricultural Cooperative also said, "The machine has no problem, but it's weak and consumes a lot of coal." It is said that they burn four or five hundred jin of coal a day. What's the problem? We also conducted a firing test on the spot. When we started the fire, we always kept the coal layer in the furnace only three inches thick, adding a little more than one jin of coal every three minutes or so, adding it evenly, and frequently removing the coke. The furnace door was opened for a very short time. In this way, it took an hour to start the fire and two hours to run the machine. In about three hours, only two-thirds of a hundred jin of coal was used, and the water output was better than that of a five-horsepower diesel engine. The farmers were very satisfied. Later, we learned that when they were firing, the coal layer in the furnace was flush with the top, and they added charcoal too frequently and too much. Not only was the coal consumption large, but the firepower was not strong, and it was not easy to generate steam; even if steam was generated, the amount was small, and the steam supply could not meet the demand soon after starting the machine. Therefore, the farmers said, "After spending a lot of effort, the steam is generated, but when the machine starts, the steam pressure drops. This is not a boiler-tractor, this is an angry machine." After the members of the Houcheng Township Agricultural Cooperative saw how we fired the fire, and we explained the simple principles of firing to them one by one, they learned it in less than an hour.

Some agricultural cooperatives are also afraid to burn the steam pressure to the specified standard. According to the cooperative members, the teacher said during the training in the county, "Burning a fire cannot exceed the steam pressure, and if it exceeds it, the boiler will explode. If it explodes, it will be more powerful than a plane dropping a bomb." Therefore, they usually only burn the steam to three or four kilograms when firing steam, which is only half of the specified steam pressure, and the machine will certainly not have power. During the test at the Zhaolanzhuang Agricultural Cooperative, we burned the fire half a kilogram over the specified steam pressure, and the safety valve started to emit steam. They were very scared, so we turned on the water pump to add water to the boiler, and at the same time closed the ash door, and the steam pressure quickly dropped to the specified steam pressure. We told them: These are normal phenomena and are not scary. The fireman should always keep the steam pressure gauge pointer steady at the specified steam pressure position; if the steam pressure exceeds the specified steam pressure by half a kilogram, the safety valve will definitely emit gas, which is nothing to worry about.

Most of the nineteen machines we inspected were poorly maintained. The smoke pipes in the boiler were mostly not brushed, and the smoke pipe holes were almost blocked by coal smoke. If the smoke pipes are not airtight or very little air flows through, how can steam be generated and how can coal not be consumed? Some of the boilers have not been cleaned of scale, and some are even more than an inch thick, which not only consumes coal but also poses a risk of explosion. What is particularly serious is that most of the machines are placed in the field without covers, exposed to the sun and rain, and some are even dismantled and scattered on the roadside, which is simply not like a machine. The day we went to the Donghetou Township Agricultural Cooperative, we found that they had used a boiler-tractor the day before and did not drain the water. Fortunately, the weather was still warm that day. After checking, only the machine oil tank was frozen, and the water in the boiler could still be drained. If the weather was colder, the boiler would freeze and crack, and the water pump cylinder would also freeze and crack, and the machine would be scrapped.

This investigation in the countryside has made me deeply realize that in addition to supplying farmers with machines, we must also teach farmers how to use them. Only supplying farmers with machines without teaching them how to use them will not only prevent the machines already supplied from playing their full role and gradually turning into scrap iron, but also affect farmers' interest in using machines, making it difficult to promote the machines manufactured in the future, causing the accumulation of state property, and at the same time causing bad effects on the worker-peasant alliance.

How to correct the shortcomings of insufficient attention to teaching farmers how to use machines in the past? Of course, it is also a way for each manufacturer to send people to the countryside to impart technology, but it is not allowed in terms of time and manpower. I think the best way is to organize short-term training courses during the slack winter season. Within ten days and a half a month, farmers must be taught how to use the machines. Those who do not have machines now should also be organized to study in advance so that they can give full play to the effectiveness of the boiler-tractors during the spring plowing next year and ensure increased production.

The farmers also reported that it is difficult to buy parts for the boiler-tractors, and they requested that the supply and marketing cooperatives in each county must supply boiler-tractor parts. According to them, general hardware materials such as water gates have to be bought in Shijiazhuang. Each water gate is only worth more than two yuan, but it takes two or three days to travel back and forth, and the travel expenses are three or four yuan, which is not only an economic loss but also a waste of time. As for special parts, it is even more impossible to buy them. The eccentric of the machine in Kongmengzhuang was broken, and people were sent to Shijiazhuang for seven or eight days, but no factory would make it, and this machine has been shelved until now and cannot be used. I think the county supply and marketing cooperatives should meet the farmers' needs and supply some common parts for the boiler-tractors. As for special parts, I also hope that the relevant departments will designate special factories to manufacture them, and it is best to designate the factory that produces the machines to supply the parts.

Finally, the comrades who manage the boiler-tractors in the cooperatives also have some opinions. They said: "The head of the cooperative does not pay attention to the management of the machines. We ask to build houses for the machines, but the head of the cooperative always delays; we want to repair the machines, brush the smoke pipes, and clean the scale, but the head of the cooperative does not give us work points. How can the machines be maintained well like this?" I think these reflections are worth noting by the agricultural cooperatives.

    锅驼机在晋县农村
    石家庄货车修理工厂工程师　李道举
    石家庄货车修理工厂为了支援农业合作化，曾制造了一批五马力锅驼机送到农村。以后，也听到农村里的一些反映，但意见很不一致。有的说锅驼机质量很好，还给我们送了红旗；也有的说质量不好，不但不交价款，还要求退货。为了了解事情的真实情况，厂里派我同一位检查员、两名工人一同去河北晋县作了实地调查。
    我们用了八天的时间，走访了晋县的五个区，行程二百五十多里地，共检查了十九部机器。发现这些机器并没有什么毛病，质量也很好，主要问题还是农民缺乏使用锅驼机的技术。
    我们来到营里乡农业社时，社长和一部分社员都当着我们说：“这是磕头机，你向它磕头也赶不上一头驴拉水车快。”我们说坏了帮着修，他们却说：“我看这部机器神仙也治不好”……。社里不但没有把买锅驼机的钱付给供销社，还要求退货。后来，我们花了三个钟头的时间把机器的各个部分都检查过了，并没有发现损坏了的地方，接着就开始生火，当汽压烧到七公斤时，把机器一开，水车带上来的水便从水堰里溢出来。这时，围观的几十个男女社员都拍手欢呼，喜欢得跳起来。有的说，“看！十头大骡子也顶不上它！”有的说：“一天至少能浇五十亩地。”最后大家都说：“工人老大哥造的机器真好，只怪我们不会使。”我们又给他们讲了锅驼机哪些地方容易出毛病，使用锅驼机要注意什么事情，又把烧火的技术教给了他们。临走的时候，农业社的社长还给我们写了封信，表示谢意。后来，他们把买机器的钱还给了供销社，而且表示明年还要买两部锅驼机。
    这只是一个例子，在其他各地遇到的情况也大体相同。
    农民对锅驼机的使用有那些不妥当的地方呢？根据我们这次下乡调查看来，最严重的问题是生火。侯城乡农业社的社长也说：“机器是没有毛病，就是力量小、费煤。”据说他们一天要烧四、五百斤煤。问题出在那里呢？我们也当场作了生火试验。我们生火，总使炉内的煤层只保持三寸来厚，三分钟左右才加一斤多煤，加得均匀，经常把焦子取出，炉门打开时间也很短。这样，生火用了一个钟头，开了两个钟头，三小时左右，一百斤煤仅用了三分之二，出水量赛过五马力柴油机。农民们都很满意，后来我们了解，他们烧火时，炉内煤层齐口，炭加得太勤太多，不独炭的消耗量大，火力不强，也不容易烧上汽来；就是烧上了汽，量也少，开车不久，蒸汽就供不应求。所以农民说“费了半天的劲，把汽烧上来了，一开车汽压就降落了。这那是锅驼机，这是一部生气机。”侯城乡农业社的社员们看了我们是怎样生火的，我们又把生火的简单原理一一向他们讲了，不用一个钟头，他们就学会了。
    还有一些农业社不敢把汽压烧到指定的标准。据社员们说，在县里学习时，老师曾讲过：“烧火不能烧过汽压，烧过了锅炉就有爆炸的危险；若是爆炸了，比飞机丢炸弹还厉害。”因此，平常他们烧汽时只烧到三、四公斤，仅及指定汽压的一半，机器当然不会有力量。在赵兰庄农业社试验时，我们烧火较指定汽压超过了半公斤，保安伐开始冒汽了，他们很害怕，我们就把水泵开动，向锅炉上水，同时把灰门关上，汽压很快就降到指定汽压。我们就告诉他们：这些都是正常现象，并不可怕。烧火的人应该使汽压的表针永远平稳地停止在指定汽压的位置上；若是汽压较指定汽压超过半公斤，保安伐一定会冒气，没有什么关系。
    我们检查了的十九部机器，大部分保养得很差。锅炉里的烟管大都没有刷过，烟管孔都快被煤烟子堵死了。烟管不透气或者透得很少，怎么能烧上汽来，又怎么能不费煤呢？有些锅炉里的水锈也没有打过，有的竟有一寸多厚，不仅费煤，还有爆炸的危险。特别严重的是大部分机器都放在地里，没有盖的，日晒夜露，有的甚至给拆得七零八落，丢在路旁，简直不像是一部机器。我们到冻河头乡农业社去的那天，发现他们有一部锅驼机头天用了连水都没有放。幸好那天气候还暖和，我们检查了一下，只有机器油箱冻了，锅炉里的水还能放出来，若气候再冷一点，锅炉会冻裂，水泵汽缸也会冻裂，那时候机器也就报废了。
    这次下乡调查，使我深深体会到，除了供给农民机器外，还要教会农民使用机器。只供给农民机器，不教会农民使用机器，不仅已供给的机器不能充分发挥作用，会逐渐变成废铁，也会影响农民使用机器的兴趣，使今后制造出来的机器不易推销，造成国家财产的积压，同时还会对工农联盟造成不好的影响。
    怎样纠正过去对教会农民使用机器注意不够的缺点呢？各制造厂派人到农村去传授技术，当然也是个办法，可是时间上、人力上都不允许。我觉得，最好是利用冬季农闲的时候，组织短期训练班，十天半个月内，一定要教会农民使用机器。现在还没有机器的，也要预先就组织他们学习，以便在明年春耕时很好地发挥锅驼机的效力，保证增产。
    农民们还反映锅驼机的配件很难买到，他们要求各县供销社一定要供给锅驼机配件。据他们谈：一般的五金材料如水门等都要到石家庄去买。每只水门价钱只值两元多，但往返就要两三天，旅费就要三、四元，不独经济上受损失，时间上也很浪费。至于专门配件更是无处购配了。孔孟庄的机器偏心坏了，派人到石家庄跑了七、八天，各工厂都不给做，这部机器一直搁到现在还无法用。我认为县供销社应该满足农民的要求，供应一部分锅驼机的普通配件，至于专门配件，也希望有关部门指定专门工厂制造，最好是指定那个工厂出的机器，由那个工厂供应配件。
    最后，合作社里管理锅驼机的同志也有一些意见。他们说：“社长对机器管理不重视。要求给机器盖房子，社长总是拖；我们要修理机器、刷烟管、打水锈，社长不给工分，这样机器怎么能保养好？”我认为这些反映都是值得农业社注意的。
