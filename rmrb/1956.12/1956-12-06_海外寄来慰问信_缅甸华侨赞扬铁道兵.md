Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, December 4th: Railway soldiers constructing the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway have received a large number of comfort letters from overseas Chinese groups and individuals in Burma. A joint letter from the Burmese Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Merchants' General Association, and the Rangoon Chinese Retailers' Association stated: "The news that the Yingxia Railway is about to open is warming the hearts of overseas Chinese like a spring breeze; the heroic deeds appearing on the Yingxia Railway day and night are inspiring the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese. When overseas Chinese who have been away from their hometown for a long time and have deep feelings for every plant and tree in their homeland, return home in groups to visit relatives and take the comfortable trains of the motherland, running on the railways you have built, everyone's heart will be filled with a sweet feeling. Thank you for fulfilling the wishes of overseas Chinese for many years." Thirty-four students of the Spark Class of Rangoon Chinese Middle School said in a collective letter: "Dear uncles who build the road, every time in the silent night, we seem to see thousands of lights shining on the land of the motherland, and see the long iron dragon running back and forth in our hometown. Uncles! We will remember your names with eternal memory—Railway Soldiers. In our geography notebooks, we will draw a detailed map of the Yingxia Railway, with the words: The road to happiness formed by the painstaking efforts of thousands of uncles."

Many elderly overseas Chinese also wrote poems to praise them. Mr. Wu Peigen, the principal of Rangoon Chinese Middle School, wrote two seven-character律诗 poems, one of which is: Bravely and resolutely opening up the Minjiang area, bringing happiness to the people with endless joy, circumventing the mountains to open tunnels, and building bridges over rapid torrents; heading north to Beijing and Shanghai to view scenic spots, and going south to Xiamen to strengthen national defense. Such great achievements will be realized at the end of the year, praising your great achievements and wishing you good health.

　　海外寄来慰问信
　　缅甸华侨赞扬铁道兵
    新华社福州4日电　修建鹰潭—厦门铁路的铁道兵收到缅甸华侨团体或个人寄来的大批慰问信。缅甸华商商会、华侨兴商总会和仰光华侨门市公会的一封联名信上说：“鹰厦铁路快要通车的消息，像春风一样吹暖了侨胞们的心；鹰厦铁路上日日夜夜出现的英雄事迹，鼓舞着侨胞们爱国的热情。当久别家乡，对桑梓一草一木都怀有深厚感情的海外侨胞，结伴还乡省亲，坐上祖国舒服的火车，奔驰在你们修筑的铁路上的时候，每个人的心里都会荡漾起一阵甜蜜的感觉。感谢你们实现了侨胞多年的愿望。”仰光中华中学星火班的三十四个学生在一封集体信上说：“亲爱的筑路的叔叔们，每当寂静的夜晚，我们就仿佛看到祖国的土地上闪烁着千里灯火，看到那长长的铁龙在故乡来回奔驰。叔叔们！我们将以永恒的记忆，来记住你们的名字——铁道兵。在地理作业本上，我们将绘上一幅鹰厦铁路的详图，上面写着：千百位叔叔的心血结成的幸福之路。”
    许多华侨老人也作诗歌颂。仰光中华中学校长吴培根老先生写了两首七律诗，其中一首是：英雄刚毅辟闽疆，造福人民乐未央，峻岭迂回开隧道，急湍奔流架桥梁；北通京沪观名胜，南下鹭江固国防，如此丰功年底现，颂君伟绩体安康。
