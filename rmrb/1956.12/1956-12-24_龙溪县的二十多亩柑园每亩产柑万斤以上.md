　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhangzhou, 23rd: In Longxi County, a major citrus-producing area in Fujian Province, 24.07 mu of citrus orchards have yielded over 10,000 jin of citrus per mu this year. These high-yielding citrus orchards are located in four townships: Ke Keng, Jiuhu, and Xintang. The citrus trees in the orchards are mostly in their prime production period. In addition, agricultural cooperatives have specialized production teams (groups) that carefully cultivate and manage the trees and apply fertilizer, resulting in an unprecedented bumper harvest. The highest yield per mu in these citrus orchards reached 15,288 jin, while the lowest was over 10,900 jin, an increase of more than two to three times the local average yield.

    新华社漳州23日电　福建省主要柑桔产地的龙溪县，今年有二十四亩零七厘柑树园每亩产柑子一万斤以上。这些高额丰产的柑树园分布在科坑、九湖、新塘等四个乡，园里柑树大都正当盛产期，加上农业社有专业生产队（组）精心栽培管理和加工加肥，因此获得空前丰收。这些柑树园每亩产量高的达一万五千二百八十八斤，低的也达一万零九百多斤，比当地平均产量增加两倍到三倍多。
