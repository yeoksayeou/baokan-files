The First Sub-Delegation in Garzê

The arrival of the Central Delegation's First Sub-Delegation in Garzê brought joy to this city surrounded by snow-capped mountains. Farmers, herdsmen, working cadres, lamas from monasteries, and ethnic leaders from the suburbs or remote villages constantly came to the delegation's residence to meet with the慰问 personnel. Some came to present hadas to the delegation to express their gratitude, some to invite the delegation to visit their areas, and others to request the delegation to help them solve some difficult problems or difficulties in their work and lives.

In these few days, members of the Central Delegation split into many groups to go deep into the urban agencies and nearby rural areas to express their regards to people from all walks of life, and to convey the Party and government's policy of implementing peaceful reform and safeguarding freedom of religious belief in Tibetan areas. They also visited the famous local large monasteries—Garzê Monastery and Dajin Monastery, distributed alms to all the lamas, and accepted gifts from the temples. The "Lhamoiba" Tibetan opera troupe of Garzê Monastery also specially performed Tibetan opera and Tibetan dance for the delegation.

The Third Sub-Delegation in Maqu

The Central Delegation's Third Sub-Delegation held a慰问 conference in Maqu on the 22nd. Huang Jianye (Tibetan), Deputy Secretary of the CPC Maqu County Committee, spoke on behalf of all the herdsmen in the county. He said that they would fight to the end for socialism. The Central Delegation's Third Sub-Delegation arrived at the Maqu Grassland, the first bend of the Yellow River among the nine bends, on the 21st, braving more than ninety kilometers of grassland wind and snow. Huang Jianye, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Maqu County Committee, A'Gai, Deputy County Head of Maqu County and Tusi of the Qiao Ke Tribe, Gya Buzang, Vice Chairman of the County Political Consultative Conference and Lama of the Ola Tribe's Monastery, and more than 30 leading figures from various tribes in the county, presented hadas to the delegation eight li away. Then, according to traditional rituals, horse racing and archery were held. When the delegation arrived in Maqu City, it was warmly welcomed by more than 200 people who had been waiting for a long time in the snow.

The Fifth Sub-Delegation in Ninglang

Part of the Central Delegation's Fifth Sub-Delegation is carrying out extensive慰问 activities in Ninglang Yi Autonomous County, one of the Yi ethnic group's settlements in northwestern Yunnan. When they arrived at Baiquba, where the People's Committee of the Autonomous County is located, on December 7th, an Yi ethnic dance team led them through the welcoming ranks with singing and dancing, and thousands of residents of Yi, Tibetan, Han and other ethnic groups cheered and applauded. The delegation held two conferences in the Autonomous County successively, expressing their cordial regards to the local people of all ethnic groups, cadres of organs and stationed troops. At the conference, the delegation, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the Central People's Government, donated four million jin of grain and more than 21,000 sets of clothing to the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous County, and presented banners and gifts to the cadres of organs and stationed troops who worked tirelessly for the people of all ethnic groups.

The delegation members left Baiquba on the 18th, climbed mountains and crossed ridges to go deep into the countryside, and began to express their regards to the farmers of all ethnic groups. (According to Xinhua News Agency) (Attached photo)

    中央慰问团的慰问活动
    第一分团在甘孜
    中央慰问团第一分团人员到达甘孜，给这座雪山包围中的城市带来了一片欢欣。慰问团住所不断进出着从城郊或遥远乡村前来会见慰问人员的农民、牧民、工作干部和喇嘛寺的喇嘛、民族领袖人物。他们有的来向慰问团献哈达表示感谢，有的为了邀请慰问团到他们那里去，有的则是请求慰问团帮助他们解决一些疑难问题或工作和生活中的一些困难。
    在这几天中，中央慰问团人员分成许多路深入到城区各机关单位和附近农村向各界人民进行慰问，并且传达了党和政府在藏族地区实行和平改革和维护宗教信仰自由的政策。他们还慰问了当地著名的大喇嘛寺——甘孜寺和大金寺，对全体喇嘛散放了布施，并且接受了寺庙的献礼。甘孜寺的“拉茂瓦”藏戏团还特地为慰问团演出了藏戏和藏族舞蹈。
    第三分团在玛曲
    中央慰问团第三分团22日在玛曲举行了慰问大会。中共玛曲县委副书记黄建业（藏族）代表全县牧民讲了话。他说，他们要为社会主义奋斗到底。中央慰问团第三分团是在21日冒着九十多公里的草原风雪到达黄河九曲中的第一曲的玛曲草原的。中共玛曲县委员会副书记黄建业，玛曲县副县长、乔科部落土官阿盖、县政协副主席、欧拉部落寺院喇嘛呷布藏和全县各部落领袖人物三十多人，到八里外向慰问团献哈达。接着，按照传统的仪式，举行了跑马射箭。慰问团到达玛曲城时，受到在雪中等候很久的二百多人的热烈欢迎。
    第五分团在宁蒗
    中央慰问团第五分团部分团员正在云南西北部彝族聚居区之一的宁蒗彝族自治县进行广泛的慰问活动。他们在12月7日到达自治县人民委员会所在地的白渠坝时，一支载歌载舞的彝族舞蹈队引导他们通过了欢迎行列，数千彝、藏、汉等族居民欢呼鼓掌。慰问团人员先后在自治县举行了两次大会，对当地各族人民、机关干部和驻军进行了亲切慰问。在大会上，慰问团代表党中央和中央人民政府把四百万斤粮食和两万一千多套衣服赠送给自治县各族人民，并把锦旗和礼品赠给不辞劳苦为各族人民服务的机关干部和驻军。
