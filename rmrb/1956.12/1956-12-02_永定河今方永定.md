　　The Yongding River is Now Forever Settled
　　Ma Gongyu
    This time I had the opportunity to come to the North, and I saw new constructions of magnificent splendor everywhere, making me "dazzled and speechless." Among them, the most impressive thing was the Guanting Reservoir on the Yongding River.
    One clear morning, I, along with comrades from the China Democratic League, took the Fengsha Railway train to visit. We boarded the train at Xizhimen in Beijing, passed through Shijingshan, and arrived at Sanjiadian, where we entered the mountain area from the plains. From Sanjiadian to Guanting Village is only sixty-two kilometers, but it passes through sixty-five tunnels and countless large and small bridges. One can imagine how arduous the construction of this railway was. When I arrived at Guanting Village, I climbed onto the dam. What I saw before me was a vast lake with碧波接天, the color of the lake water was indescribable, only the water color of the Shimen Pool in Yandang Mountain could be compared. A worker said to me: A few years ago, this place was a barren mountain valley, dilapidated villages, and messy beaches. It is completely two different worlds from what it is now. When he spoke, his eyes revealed a pride of victory. I gazed at the dam for a long time, and many thoughts arose in my heart.
    The Yongding River is the largest of the five major rivers in the Haihe River system on the North China Plain. Because the river channel in the upper reaches is very steep, the water flow is rapid, and the sediment content is large, the riverbed in the lower reaches is raised year by year, and the river channel is difficult to fix. Whenever there are heavy rains and the water rises, the dikes often collapse, seriously endangering the people on both sides for thousands of years. This river has never been stable, so in the past it was called the "Undetermined River" ("无定河"). Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty wanted to prevent the Undetermined River from causing floods, so he specially "bestowed" it with the name "Yongding River" ("永定河," meaning "Forever Settled River"). Of course, the Undetermined River would never change its bad temper because of the emperor's "bestowed title."
    After liberation, the People's Government immediately started the plan to fundamentally control the Yongding River and build the Guanting Reservoir. This reservoir is located in Guanting Village in Huailai County, Hebei Province. We can speculate that "Guanting Village" got its name because it was the place where river management officials of previous dynasties were stationed. What achievements did these officials ever make? The current Guanting Reservoir was built under the leadership of the Ministry of Water Resources and the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. Thanks to the support of the people across the country, the help of Soviet experts, and the spirit of patriotism and revolutionary heroism displayed by all employees, they worked tirelessly day and night, overcoming various difficulties, and successfully completed it in just two years and six months. From then on, the floods of the Yongding River were basically eliminated, and the Yongding River truly deserved its name of being "Forever Settled," serving the people and benefiting the people.
    In this calm and beautiful huge artificial lake, countless aquatic products have been bred. The large fish weigh two and a half kilograms. On the clear blue water,游鱼 can often be seen floating up, making people think of the joy of fish in濠濮. Around the lake, sanatoriums for the working people have begun to be built. Trees and fruit trees have begun to be planted on the lakeside and nearby mountains. This will become a beautiful scenic spot. In order to make full use of the water stored in the reservoir, the "Guanting Hydropower Station" has been built on the left bank of the dam, which is currently the largest hydropower station in North China. To visit the hydropower station, you have to climb a high hillside. The tour guide said: Old people don't need to go up, for fear it will be too strenuous. However, several comrades of similar age to me, all around seventy years old, all scrambled to climb up, which shows that old people in this era have become younger.
    The Guanting Reservoir has added great strength to the socialist construction of the motherland and has shown endless prospects. It is only the first flower. In the near future, we will see more and larger Guanting Reservoirs appearing all over the country, and countless flowers will bloom all over China. I wrote a poem during the visit to express my thoughts:
            The Yongding River is now forever settled,
          Guanting is no longer the Guanting of the past.
          Fish and dragons happily swim in new caves,
          Wild geese should be surprised to lose the old path.
          The Five Ding of the Shu Road are not worth comparing,
          The Three Strategies of Changsha are truly unmatched.
          Many miracles have been created in recent years,
          I want to rewrite the Water Classic from the beginning.

　　永定河今方永定
　　马公愚
    我这次有机会到北方来，看见处处都是辉煌灿烂的新建设，使我“眼花撩乱口难言”，就中给我印象最深的，莫过于永定河上的官厅水库。
    我在一个晴朗的早晨，偕同民盟诸同志，乘坐丰沙铁路的车子去参观。从北京西直门上车，经过石景山，到了三家店，便由平原地带进入丛山区域。自三家店至官厅村仅六十二公里，却要经过六十五个隧洞和无数的大小桥梁，可想见这条铁路的建筑工程是怎样的艰巨。我到了官厅村，登上了拦河坝，眼前看到的是一个碧波接天一望无际的大湖，那湖水的碧色，是难以形容的，只有雁荡山石门潭的水色，差可比拟。一位工人对我说：几年以前，这里是荒山空谷，破旧的村庄，凌乱的滩头，与现在是完全两个天地。他说话时，眼睛里流露出胜利的骄傲。我在拦河坝上眺望了好久，心中不禁起了很多的感想。
    永定河是华北平原上的海河水系五大河中最大的一条河。因为上游河道坡度很陡，水流湍急，含沙量大，下游河床逐年抬高，河漕难以固定，每当暴雨水涨，常致堤防溃决，千百年来，严重地危害着两岸人民，这条河从来未曾安定过，所以过去原是叫做“无定河”。清朝的康熙皇帝想使无定河不发生水灾，特“封”为“永定河”，当然，无定河决不因皇帝“封号”而改变它的坏脾气。
    解放以后，人民政府立即着手进行根治永定河的计划，修建官厅水库。这水库是在河北省怀来县的官厅村，我们可以揣想这“官厅村”是因为历代治河官吏驻在的地方而得名的，这些官厅何尝有丝毫成绩做出来呢？现在的官厅水库是在水利部和中共河北省委员会的领导下，由于全国人民的支援，苏联专家的帮助，全体职工发挥了爱国主义与革命英雄主义的精神，无冬无夏，夜以继日，克服种种困难，在短短的两年六个月的时间而胜利完成的。从此，永定河的水灾基本上消除了，永定河就真正名副其实地“永远安定”，为人民服务，为人民造福了。
    在这个平静而美丽的巨大人造湖里，已经繁殖了无数的水产物，大的鱼有二斤半重，在澄碧的水面，时见游鱼浮上来，令人有濠濮间想。湖的周围已经开始修建劳动人民的疗养院。湖滨和附近山上已开始种植林木和果树。这里将成为一个优美的风景区。为了充分利用水库的蓄水，已经在拦河坝左岸修建
  “官厅水电站”，这是目前华北最大的一座水电站。参观水电站，要登上一个高的山坡，导游同志说：年老的人，不必上去，怕太吃力。但是，同我年龄相似的几位同志，都是七十岁左右的，个个争先登上去，可见得现在时代老人都变年轻了。
    官厅水库对祖国社会主义建设事业增加了很大的力量，并展示了无穷的远景，它只是第一朵鲜花，在不久的将来，我们就可看到更多更大的官厅水库在全国各处出现，无数鲜花开遍中华。我在参观的时候作了一首诗，以志感想：
            永定河今方永定，
          官厅非复昔官厅。
          鱼龙自乐游新窟，
          鸿雁应惊失旧陉。
          蜀道五丁安足拟，
          长沙三策信无伦。
          年来开凿多奇迹，
          我欲从头注水经。
