Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 12th:  National People's Congress representatives Hu Yuzhi, Hu Sheng, Xu Liqun and others recently inspected six major factories and various types of workers' residential areas in Anshan Iron and Steel Company (An'gang) and offered criticisms and suggestions to the Anshan Municipal Party and government leaders regarding the difficulties in the lives of Anshan workers.

Xu Liqun, during his inspection, observed that workers lived in extremely crowded conditions, and there was a significant disparity between the living conditions of An'gang cadres and workers. He suggested that cadres should promote the spirit of sharing weal and woe with the masses and give up some of their housing to workers in urgent need. Hu Yuzhi believed that the commercial work in Anshan had not kept pace with the needs of industrial development. For example, in Taiping Village, a workers' residential area with a population of 70,000, there was only one small cooperative, which forced many workers to queue up or travel several miles to buy things, wasting a lot of time. He offered suggestions for improvement.

The representatives also suggested that the relevant departments in Anshan Municipality should actively take measures to change the current situation where children of An'gang workers have to wait until they are eight years old to enter primary school.

During his inspection, Hu Yuzhi also held a forum with senior intellectuals in Anshan to understand their progress in advancing towards science, as well as their living difficulties and demands.

    人民代表在鞍山视察后
    就工人生活问题提出批评建议
    新华社鞍山12日电　全国人民代表大会代表胡愈之、胡绳、许立群等最近视察了鞍钢六个主要工厂和各种类型的工人住宅区后，就鞍山市工人生活上的困难问题对鞍山市党和政府部门的负责人提出了批评和建议。
    许立群在视察中见到工人居住非常拥挤，鞍钢干部和工人的居住条件相差很远，他建议干部应该发扬与群众同甘共苦的精神，让出一部分房子给急需住房的工人居住。胡愈之认为鞍山的商业工作没有赶上工业发展的需要，像在太平村这样一个已经有七万人口的职工住宅区里，只有一个不大的合作社，这使很多职工不得不排队或到几里路外的地方去买东西，浪费很多时间。他对此提出了改进的意见。
    代表们还建议鞍山市有关方面积极采取措施，改变目前鞍钢的工人子弟要到八岁才能入小学的情况。
    胡愈之在视察工作期间还与鞍山市的高级知识分子举行座谈，了解了他们向科学进军方面的情况以及生活上的困难和要求。
