As long as you work heartily
(Mongolian Proverb)

	As long as you work heartily,
	Even a bullock cart can chase a rabbit.
	Many hands and feet working together,
	Are better than a lonely hero.
	A flock of magpies,
	Is stronger than a solitary tiger.
	People easily stumble on sweet words,
	Horses often fall on soft ground.
	Weeping and sorrow,
	Are not as good as clenching your fist.

    只要真心干
    （蒙古谚语）
    只要真心干，
    牛车也能把兔赶。
    多手多脚干，
    赛过伶仃英雄汉。
    群聚的喜鹊，
    要比单走的虎强。
    人在甜言上易栽跟头，
    马在软地上常打前失。
    泣泪悲愁，
    不如握紧拳头。
