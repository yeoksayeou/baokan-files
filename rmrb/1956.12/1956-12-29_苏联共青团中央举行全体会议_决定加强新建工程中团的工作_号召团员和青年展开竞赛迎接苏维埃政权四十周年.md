Xinhua News Agency, December 28th, Moscow dispatch from TASS: The Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union held a plenary session from December 26th to 27th.

The meeting communique released here stated that the meeting listened to and discussed the report by Comrade Zarubin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the League, on the work carried out by the League organizations among the youth in the new construction sites in the eastern and northern regions of the Soviet Union and the Donbass, and the report by Comrade Semiçastny, Secretary of the Central Committee of the League, on measures to improve the work among the youth in land reclamation.

The plenary session unanimously supported the resolutions of the December Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee on behalf of the League members and Soviet youth.

The communique stated that the League members and Soviet youth responded with high enthusiasm to the call of the CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers to the League members and all Soviet youth to actively participate in the most important construction projects of the Sixth Five-Year Plan. In a short period of time, more than 200,000 young men and women received League permits and went to the new construction sites in the eastern and northern regions of the Soviet Union and the Donbass. Now, they are overcoming various difficulties, successfully mastering construction techniques, striving to complete and overfulfill production quotas and various tasks, and undergoing significant tests in labor. The League organizations have greatly grown and strengthened in various new construction projects, and their role in the economic and social life of various units has also been enhanced.

The communique then pointed out the serious shortcomings in the work of the League organizations in new enterprises and construction units, and instructed the relevant League agencies and organizations to take all necessary measures in conjunction with economic leaders to eliminate the shortcomings in labor organization and youth production education, save construction materials, more boldly explore and better utilize internal potential, and do their best to shorten construction periods, and promote quick operation methods and flow-line operation.

The plenary session approved the initiative of the League members and youth of the Ukrainian Republic, who undertook patriotic pledges to complete the construction of thirty-five new mines ahead of the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the Soviet regime. The plenary session called on the League members and youth of all new construction projects to participate in socialist competitions to greet the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the Soviet regime.

The communique stated that the primary task of the League is to participate in the construction of the largest power stations, coal mines, industrial enterprises, and railways in the eastern and northern regions of the Soviet Union and the Donbass. Therefore, all League organizations must establish close ties with the youth working in new construction projects, correspond with them, exchange delegations, and send books and cultural and sports supplies to the new construction projects.

The Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League decided to convene a national congress of outstanding young builders from new construction projects in Moscow at the end of 1957. The Central Committee of the League is issuing a commemorative medal for "Advanced Youth of New Construction Projects of the Sixth Five-Year Plan."

In view of Laposhin's transfer to participate in studies, the plenary session relieved him of his duties as Secretary and member of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League. The meeting elected A. Aksyonov as Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, and N. N. Mesyatsev as Secretary and member of the Central Committee.

    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会从12月26日到27日举行了全体会议。
    据这里发表的会议公报说，这次会议听取并且讨论了团中央书记扎鲁日尼所作的关于共青团组织在苏联东部、北部地区和顿巴斯的新建筑工地的青年中所进行的工作的报告，和团中央书记谢米恰斯内伊所作的关于改进在垦荒青年中的工作的措施的报告。
    全体会议代表共青团员和苏联青年一致拥护苏共中央十二月全会的决议。
    公报说，共青团员和苏联青年们以高涨的热情响应了苏共中央和部长会议向共青团员们和全体苏联青年发出的积极参加第六个五年计划中最重要的建设工程的号召，在短短的时间内就有二十多万男女青年领到了共青团的许可证，走向苏联东部、北部地区和顿巴斯的新建筑工地。现在，他们克服着种种困难，成功地掌握建筑技术，争取完成和超额完成生产定额和各项任务，在劳动中接受重大考验。共青团组织在各个新建工程中大大地成长和加强了，它们在各单位的经济生活和社会生活中的作用也提高了。
    公报接着指出共青团组织在新企业和建设单位中的工作上的严重缺点，并且责成有关的共青团机构和组织与经济领导人员共同采取一切必要措施，消灭在劳动组织和青年生产教育中的缺点，节省建筑材料，更勇敢地发掘和更好地利用内部潜力，尽力缩短建筑期限，推广快速作业法和流水作业法。
    全体会议赞同乌克兰共和国的共青团员和青年们的倡议，他们承担爱国的保证，要在苏维埃政权成立四十周年前提前建成三十五个新矿井。全体会议号召一切新建工程的共青团员和青年们参加社会主义竞赛，迎接苏维埃政权成立四十周年。
    公报说，共青团的首要任务是参加苏联东部和北部地区以及顿巴斯的最大电力站、煤矿、工业企业和铁路的建设工作。因此，一切共青团组织必须和在新建工程工作的青年建立紧密的联系，和他们通信，互换代表团，给新建工程寄书籍和文化、体育用品。
    苏联共青团中央决定在1957年底召集新建工程中的优秀青年在莫斯科举行全苏青年建设者大会。团中央正在颁制“第六个五年计划新工程先进青年”纪念章。
    鉴于拉波辛调去参加学习，全会解除了他的苏联共青团中央委员会书记和委员的职务。会议选举阿·阿克塞诺夫为苏联共青团中央委员会书记，纳·纳·麦西亚泽夫为中央委员会书记和委员。
