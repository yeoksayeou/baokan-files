    Educate Them to Learn the Mass Line
    Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee Trains Basic-Level Leading Cadres in Rotation

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is using a rotational training method to educate basic-level leading cadres on the Party's mass line. This is an important measure taken by the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee based on the spirit of the Eighth National Congress to improve leadership style.

    The target of this training includes leading cadres at the level of workshops, work areas, work sections, streets, townships, and store departments in the financial and trade system, as well as other leading cadres equivalent to this level throughout the city. This training is organized separately by the Municipal Party School and the Party Committees of twelve larger industrial and mining enterprises.池必卿 (Chi Biqing), First Secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee, 赵力之 (Zhao Lizhi), Minister of Industry of the Municipal Party Committee, and other responsible comrades all lecture at the basic-level leading cadres training class of the Party School. When they lecture, large enterprises send theory instructors to audit in order to teach back to their respective organizations. As of late November, most units had started this work. The first training session of the Municipal Party School, consisting of more than 200 cadres, has already concluded. Units such as the Taiyuan Electric Power Bureau and the North China Taiyuan Engineering Bureau have also trained the first group of basic-level leading cadres.

    The basic-level leading cadres who have undergone training are deeply grateful for this education provided by the Party. Most of these cadres have only emerged from production and construction and revolutionary struggles in recent years and have not systematically received education on the Party's mass line. Another part of the basic-level leading cadres transferred from rural areas to factories and mines, although having received education on the Party's mass line, lacked experience in leading enterprises. At the same time, they blindly felt that the old rural methods were no longer applicable. Combined with the tense and heavy tasks, the excellent tradition of the mass line was lost. After receiving this mass line education, they understood why they had handled many good things poorly. Everyone painfully examined their shortcomings. 魏兆唐 (Wei Zhaotang), Secretary of the Party Branch of the Guandi Mine of the Xishan Mining Bureau, said: "This year, the selection of delegates to attend the National Advanced Producer Representatives Conference was not handed over to the masses for discussion, but was designated by the administration and the trade union. The Party Branch Committee expressed agreement without conducting any investigation. As a result, there were exaggerated facts and impersonations in the advanced deeds materials, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the entire mine's workers. Later, when workers encountered difficult tasks, they would say: 'Let the "advanced group" do it!' But I thought this was a sign of the workers' backwardness and called it gossiping. If the selection had been done by the workers, it would have further sparked a high tide of the advanced producer movement throughout the mine. In reality, due to not following the mass line, the workers' production enthusiasm was lowered instead." Many basic-level leading cadres expressed with confidence: Now that we have mastered the weapon, let us return to our work posts and look at the facts!

    Unfortunately, individual enterprise leaders have not yet understood the importance of this measure taken by the Municipal Party Committee, nor do they understand that this study is urgently needed by both basic-level leading cadres and the work itself, so their actions are not active enough.

    教育他们学会走群众路线
　　太原市委轮训基层领导干部
    本报讯　中共太原市委正在用轮训的办法，对基层领导干部进行党的群众路线的教育。这是太原市委根据“八大”精神改进领导作风的一个重要措施。
    这次训练的对象是全市车间、工区、工段、街道、乡、财贸系统中门市部一级的领导干部和相当于这一级的其他领导干部。这次训练由市委党校和十二个较大的工矿企业党委分别组织进行。中共太原市委第一书记池必卿、市委工业部长赵力之等负责同志，都到党校基层领导干部训练班讲课。他们讲课时，大企业派理论教员旁听，以便回去讲授。截至11月下旬，多数单位都开始了这一工作，市委党校第一期训练的二百多名干部已经结业，太原电业局、华北太原工程局等单位也已训练了一期基层领导干部。
    经过训练的基层领导干部，都深深感激党对他们进行的这一次教育。这些干部大多是最近几年才从生产建设和革命斗争中生长起来的，没有系统地受过党的群众路线的教育；另一部分从农村转业到厂矿企业等的基层领导干部，虽受过党的群众路线的教育，但是他们缺乏领导企业的经验，同时又盲目地感到农村那一套已全不适用，再加任务紧张繁重，因此群众路线的优良传统就丢掉了。这一次他们受到群众路线的教育以后，才懂得为什么会把许多好事办坏。大家都痛心地检讨自己的缺点。西山矿务局官地矿党支部书记魏兆唐说：“今年评选出席全国先进生产者代表会议的代表，没有交给群众讨论，只是由行政和工会指派，党支部委员会没作调查就表示同意。结果，先进事迹材料中，有夸大事实的，有冒名顶替的，引起全矿工人的不满。以后，工人们遇到难活，都说：‘叫“先进小组”去干吧！’而我却认为这是工人落后，说怪话。如果经过工人评选，一定会进一步在全矿掀起先进生产者运动的高潮。实际上，由于不走群众路线，反而使工人生产情绪低落了。”许多基层领导干部都充满了信心表示：现在掌握了武器了，回到工作岗位去看事实吧！
    可惜，个别企业领导方面还没有了解到市委采取这一措施的重要性，还不了解这一学习是基层领导干部和工作都迫切需要的，所以行动不够积极。
