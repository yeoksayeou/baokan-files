Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: According to TASS, Warsaw: Provincial congresses of the Polish United Workers' Party are currently being held to summarize work and conduct re-elections.

    "Mazowiecka Tribune" recently published the report submitted to the congress by the Warsaw Provincial Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party. The report emphasized the great significance of consolidating the Polish-Soviet alliance and friendship for defending Poland's independence, sovereignty, and socialism, and it attacked some of the recent anti-socialist and anti-Polish United Workers' Party statements that have appeared in Poland.

    The Warsaw Provincial Committee report first pointed out the significance of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party for further consolidating the Polish People's Republic and developing socialist democracy. The report also pointed out that the implementation of the Eighth Plenary Session's resolutions has also encountered many difficulties. Some people have attempted to spread anti-Marxist-Leninist views, and certain newspapers and radio stations have done so more than once, with the aim of undermining the friendship between Poland and the Soviet Union.

    The report said that anyone who thinks they can use the opportunity of democratization to weaken the Polish-Soviet alliance and friendship will inevitably be met with resolute rebuffs from our party. We and the Soviet Union have common goals. The interests of our people and the Soviet people are consistent. Class alliances and a common ideology unite us, and the common desire to consolidate peace illuminates our path. The mutual relations between Poland and the Soviet Union are based on the Leninist principles of respect for sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, equality, international solidarity, and friendship. These principles have been affirmed by the Moscow Polish-Soviet talks. The process and results of the Moscow talks, as well as the treaty signed by the Soviet and Polish governments on the legal status of Soviet troops stationed in Poland, show that the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have been, are, and will always be our strongest and most reliable friends.

    Without friendship with the Soviet people, there can be no independent Poland, and it is even more impossible to imagine building socialism in Poland.

    The report further pointed out that the Polish United Workers' Party can never allow a foothold for those who undermine Polish-Soviet friendship, or intentionally or unintentionally help spread anti-Soviet sentiment. Whoever opposes Polish-Soviet friendship undermines the independence and sovereignty of our motherland, and whoever opposes Polish-Soviet friendship also opposes the building of socialism. The attitude towards the Soviet Union is always the standard for identifying party members, patriots, and internationalists.

    The report criticized certain statements that lacked class analysis of events, and certain statements that opposed the Polish socialist system and the Polish United Workers' Party. The report pointed out that some of the articles published in the "Straight Talk" weekly could be used as examples of such statements.

    对待苏联的态度永远是鉴定爱国主义者和国际主义者的标准
    波兰统一工人党华沙省委会向党代表会议提出报告
    据新华社29日讯　据塔斯社华沙讯：波兰各省目前正在举行统一工人党的代表会议，来总结工作和进行改选。
    “马佐维茨卡论坛报”最近刊载了统一工人党华沙省委员会提交代表会议的报告。这个报告强调巩固波苏联盟和友谊对于捍卫波兰的独立、主权和社会主义所具有的重大意义，并且抨击了最近在波兰出现的一些反对社会主义、反对波兰统一工人党的言论。
    华沙省委员会的报告首先指出统一工人党八中全会对于进一步巩固波兰人民共和国和发展社会主义民主的意义。报告同时指出，八中全会决议的实施也遇到不少的困难。有人企图散布反马克思列宁主义的观点，某些报纸和电台就曾经不止一次地这样做，其目的在于破坏波兰和苏联的友谊。
    报告说，谁要是以为可以利用实行民主化的机会来削弱波苏联盟和友谊，那就必将遭到我们党的坚决的回击。我们和苏联具有共同的目标。我国人民和苏联人民的利益是一致的。阶级联盟和共同的意识形态把我们团结在一起，巩固和平的共同愿望照耀着我们的道路。波兰同苏联的相互关系是以尊重主权、不干涉内政、平等、国际团结和友好这些列宁主义原则为基础的。这些原则，已经为莫斯科波苏会谈所肯定。莫斯科会谈的过程和结果，以及苏波两国政府所签订的关于留驻波兰的苏联军队的法律地位的条约，都表明了苏联和苏联共产党过去是、将来也是我们的最强大和永远可靠的朋友。
    没有同苏联人民的友谊，就不可能有独立的波兰，更不可能设想在波兰建设社会主义。
    报告进一步指出，在波兰统一工人党内决不可能允许有破坏波苏友好、有意或无意地帮助散布反苏情绪的人的立足之地。谁反对波苏友好，谁就破坏了我们祖国的独立和主权，谁也就是反对建设社会主义。对待苏联的态度永远是鉴定党员、爱国主义者和国际主义者的标准。
    报告指责了某些对事件缺乏阶级分析、和某些反对波兰社会主义制度、反对波兰统一工人党的言论。报告指出，“直言”周刊所刊登的某些文章就可以作为这类言论的例子。
