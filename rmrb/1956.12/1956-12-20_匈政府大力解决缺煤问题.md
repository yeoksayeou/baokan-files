Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 19th: This reporter reports: The Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government is working hard to solve the difficulties in the production of the coal mining industry and has achieved preliminary results.

　　In the past few days, the production of some coal mines has made significant progress. On the 14th, Hungary produced a total of 18,150 tons of coal. Now, the daily coal production has reached 20,000 to 25,000 tons.

　　Now, increasing coal production is one of the most important conditions for the full restoration of normal industrial production. Due to the lack of coal, the national economic life of Hungary has become tense. Many industrial enterprises have resumed work, but there is insufficient coal and electricity, and production cannot be carried out at a normal speed. People's daily lives have also been greatly affected. Some schools are about to resume classes, but there is no heating. Neighboring fraternal countries have assisted Hungary with a lot of coal, but this can only solve temporary difficulties to a certain extent and cannot fundamentally change the situation of lack of coal. Therefore, producing more coal is already an urgent requirement in Hungary's national economic life.

　　In order to solve this problem, the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government has decided to immediately repair the transportation near the mining area so that miners who are far away from the mine can go to work on time; it has instructed various departments to vigorously support the production of coal mines, ensure that coal mines receive all the equipment they need, and transfer urgently needed machinery from other sectors of the national economy for coal mining. The government has also decided to transfer the technical personnel in those mining areas that are not very important now to important coal mines, and at the same time call on the staff of other enterprises and agencies to sign up to participate in mine work. Various coal mining companies are also calling on all former workers to go to work, and calling on experienced old miners who have received pensions to continue to work and teach their production skills to newcomers.

    匈政府大力解决缺煤问题
    据新华社布达佩斯19日电　本社记者报道：匈牙利工农革命政府正在着手大力解决采煤工业生产的困难，并且已经获得了初步的结果。
    在过去几天中，有些煤矿的生产已有显著的进展。14日这天，匈牙利全国共生产了一万八千一百五十吨煤。现在，每天的煤产量已经达到两万到两万五千吨。
    现在，增加煤的产量是使工业生产全部恢复正常的最重要条件之一。由于缺乏煤，匈牙利全国经济生活出现了紧张的情况。许多工业企业复工了，但是煤和电力不足，不能以正常的速度进行生产。人民的日常生活也受到了很大的影响。有的学校要复课，却没有暖气。邻近的兄弟国家援助了匈牙利很多的煤，但是，这只能在一定限度内解决暂时的困难，不能根本改变缺乏煤的情况。因此，生产更多的煤已经是匈牙利全国经济生活中迫切的要求。
    为了解决这个问题，工农革命政府已经作出决定，立即修复矿区附近的交通，使距离矿井较远的矿工能够按时上工；责成各部门大力支持煤矿的生产，保证使煤矿得到所需要的一切器材，并且从国民经济其他部门调拨急需的机器供采煤使用。政府还决定把那些现在不太重要的矿区的技术人员调到重要的煤矿去，同时号召其他企业和机关工作人员报名参加矿井工作。各个煤矿公司也正在号召过去的工人全部上工，号召已领养老金的有经验的老矿工继续上工，把他们的生产技术教给新来的人。
