Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou Electric Dispatch: Since the beginning of this month, some construction units in Lanzhou have suddenly increased their requests for appropriations from the Construction Bank. After investigation and research by the Lanzhou branch of the China People's Construction Bank, it was found that many of the units' requests for appropriations were unreasonable. For example, the Lanzhou Geological School Preparatory Office can only complete about 60% of this year's construction and installation work, and will not be completed until the second quarter of next year, and classes will not begin until September. However, this school wants to buy accordions and dancing drums and other recreational items in early December. The Gansu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry's Water Conservancy Bureau can only complete a maximum of 20% of this year's construction projects, but it actually requested to handle the final settlement first, and pay the construction unit 80% of the unspent money in advance.

In the past, the Lanzhou branch often paid the requested amount to the units applying for appropriations, which caused some waste. Now, investigations and research are conducted on each unit requesting appropriations. After discovering the above problems, patient persuasion is carried out, and the units have voluntarily abandoned the non-compliant requests.

    中国人民建设银行兰州支行
    做好调查研究工作  阻止突击花钱现象
    据新华社兰州电　从本月初以来，兰州市有些建设单位到建设银行要求拨款的突然增加，经中国人民建设银行兰州支行调查研究后，发现有不少单位的拨款要求是不合理的。如兰州地质学校筹备处今年的建筑安装工作量只能完成60％左右，明年第二季度才能竣工，9月才开课。但这个学校12月上旬就要购买手风琴和跳舞鼓等文娱用品。甘肃省农林厅水利局今年的建筑工程最多只能完成20％，但竟要求先办决算，把花不完的80％的钱预先付给施工单位。
    兰州支行过去对于要求拨款的单位往往是照数付给，因此造成某些浪费。现在对每一要求拨款的单位都做了调查研究，发现上述问题后，就进行耐心的说服工作，各单位都自动放弃了不合规定的要求。
