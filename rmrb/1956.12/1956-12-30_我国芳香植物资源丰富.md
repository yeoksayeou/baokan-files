Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 26th: China is the country with the richest resources of aromatic plants in the world. This is the conclusion reached by Jiao Qiyuan, a professor in the Biology Department of Fudan University, after surveying aromatic plant resources throughout the country.
　　Professor Jiao Qiyuan, at the invitation of the Ministry of Agriculture, conducted a three-month investigation and research on aromatic plant resources in South China, Southwest China, and East China with Chinese and Soviet experts this May. The investigation proved that China's aromatic plant resources are very abundant. The two hundred or more aromatic plants discovered so far can be made into nearly one hundred and forty kinds of aromatic raw materials and spices. Among them, camphor oil, camphor, and star anise account for more than 80% of the world's total output. Cinnamon, mint, jasmine, etc., are even unique Chinese products.
　　Aromatic plants are mainly used to extract aromatic volatile oils, which are widely used in medicine, food, cosmetics, and other industries, and are an important export commodity of our country. In rural areas such as the Leizhou Peninsula, *Gangsong*, which is used as fuel and broom handles, has volatile oils with the special effect of killing parasites in livestock muscles. *Xiangfuzi*, a weed that farmers on both sides of the Yangtze River consider the most difficult to eradicate, can be extracted into *Xiangfuzi* oil, which is used as a fixative. Violet and eugenol and eugenol aldehyde, which previously needed to be imported, can be extracted from *Shancangzi* and *Huangzhang* tree roots, which grow relatively commonly in our country.

    我国芳香植物资源丰富
    新华社上海26日电　我国是世界上芳香植物资源最丰富的国家。这是复旦大学生物系教授焦启源在全国各地调查芳香植物资源后得出的结论。
    焦启源教授是应农业部邀请，在今年5月与我国的专家和苏联专家在我国的华南、西南、华东等地对芳香植物资源进行了三个多月的调查和研究。证明我国芳香植物资源非常丰富，仅现在发现的二百多种芳香植物，即可制成近一百四十种芳香原料和香料。其中樟油、樟脑和八角茴香等都占世界总产量的80％以上。肉桂、薄荷、茉莉花等，更是中国的特产。
    芳香植物主要是用来提炼芳香挥发油，这种油在医药、食品、化妆品等工业上都有广泛的用途，是我国一项重要的出口物资。在雷州半岛等地农村中被用作燃料和帚把的岗松，它的挥发油具有杀灭牲畜肌肉中寄生虫的特殊效能。长江两岸被农民视为最难根除的野草香附子，可以提炼出作定香剂的香附子油。以往需要进口的紫罗兰和丁香醇、丁香醛，可以从我国比较普遍生长的山苍子和黄樟树根中炼取。
