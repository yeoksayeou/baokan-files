    Cannot Say the Socialist Revolution Has Been Completed
    Reader Comrade Dong Zhongru wrote: In the tenth paragraph of the People's Daily editorial "People's Lives Can Only Gradually Improve" on November 27th, there is the following sentence:
  “After arduous struggles, we have completed two great revolutions…” I think this statement is inappropriate. Our democratic revolution has been completed, and the tasks of the socialist revolution phase have been basically realized. We can say "we are in the process of completing the socialist revolution," but we cannot say "we have completed the socialist revolution."
    Comrade Dong Zhongru's opinion is correct. The word "completed" in the text should be changed to "conducting."

### 不能说社会主义革命已经完成

    不能说社会主义革命已经完成
    读者董仲如同志来信说：人民日报11月27日社论“人民生活只能逐渐改善”的第十段有这样的话：
  “我们经过艰难困苦，完成了两次伟大的革命……”我认为这提法是不恰当的。我国民主革命已经完成，并且已经基本上实现了社会主义革命阶段的任务，可以说“正在完成社会主义革命，”但不能说“已经完成了社会主义革命”。
    董仲如同志的意见很对，文中“完成”两字应该改为“进行”两字。
