New Applications of Microwave Technology
Huang Wuhan

Microwave technology is a science that developed around World War II, and initially its applications were limited to the military. However, in a short span of a dozen years, it has developed very rapidly, and now microwave technology has been widely applied to many fields of science and technology. Today, the level of development of radio electronics is used to measure a country's scientific and technological progress, and the level of microwave technology development is a very important standard for measuring the development level of radio electronics.

Countries around the world attach great importance to the development of microwave technology. In China's twelve-year plan for scientific and technological development, radio electronics research is regarded as an urgent and important measure. The Institute of Electronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which was recently established, has identified microwave technology research as a key research area.

What is microwave technology? The entire field of radio electronics encompasses a wide range, using wavelengths from several kilometers to a fraction of a millimeter. Microwaves refer to the wave band from ten meters to a fraction of a millimeter (some countries call the band from ten meters to one meter ultra-high frequency, and below one meter microwaves, while the Soviet Union collectively refers to them as ultra-high frequency or ultra-short wave).

The reason why people attach importance to the development of microwave technology is that it has the following significant advantages in application: on the one hand, modern radar, missiles, television, and multi-channel communication equipment can only be realized by using microwaves; on the other hand, the use of microwave technology can reduce natural and man-made interference. General climate and day-night changes have less impact on it, and the noise is lower. By using smaller antennas, very sharp directional beams can be obtained. Therefore, using microwave technology, it is possible to obtain methods of transmitting various signals with high efficiency, high reliability, and good quality. One of the main aspects of studying radio electronics is to continuously master shorter wavelengths. Radio scientists have now mastered the technology of centimeter waves, and the next step is to master the new technologies of millimeter waves and sub-millimeter waves. The mastery of each new and shorter wave band will inevitably bring new scientific achievements and important technical applications.

Microwave technology has a wide range of applications, and only a few of the main aspects are introduced below:

Missiles are one of the most modern weapons currently available. But missiles, without microwaves, would lose their main function. Currently, the speed of military aircraft is over a thousand kilometers, and missiles and rockets are even faster. Their speed renders ordinary anti-aircraft fire completely ineffective. If missiles use microwaves for guidance and control, the hit rate will be very high, reaching over 50%.

Radar can now determine the position of airborne objects within a range of hundreds of kilometers at any time and in any weather. Radar equipment, together with anti-aircraft guns and searchlights, forms a tight automatic control air defense network, preventing enemy aircraft from succeeding. Equipping military aircraft with radar further enhances their attack power and enables them to fight the enemy at night. If the radar operates on shorter millimeter waves, we can not only determine the direction and distance of enemy aircraft, but also see their size, shape, and distinguish their type and number. In addition, it can render certain anti-radar measures ineffective. At the same time, aircraft equipped with millimeter-wave radar can enable pilots to observe ground crew at airports from distances of two hundred meters to several kilometers. Obviously, this television-like radar is extremely important both for the national economy and for national defense.

The use of microwave technology can also guide aircraft or ships in navigation at night and in adverse weather conditions. The entire panorama of the harbor can be clearly displayed on the radar screen in the lightless night. Due to the particularly heavy air station and military flight tasks, many countries have adopted an automatic air navigation system. It can indicate the position and distance of all aircraft under its jurisdiction within a range of several hundred kilometers, and has more than one hundred microwave telephone lines that can simultaneously contact them, dispatch their traffic and take-offs and landings, and thus also predict the future position of these aircraft. This equipment all uses microwave technology.

In multi-channel communications and television, there are some common requirements. First, a wide passband is required to accommodate a large number of telegraph, telephone, broadcasting, and television program channels. Second, it is required that the propagation of radio waves be less affected by natural and man-made interference, as well as climate and day-night influences. All of these requirements can only be met by using microwave technology.

Previously, when the level of microwave technology was still low, the propagation distance of general microwave relay stations was only about one hundred kilometers. Now scientists have discovered that microwaves can transmit signals to very far distances. This method of propagation is called "scatter" propagation. Some comrades who work in long-distance radio communications know that with short-wave communications, it is necessary to frequently change the communication frequency every year, every season, or even every day and every hour. Due to the appearance of strong sunspots, sometimes it is impossible to communicate no matter what frequency is used. If microwave communication is used, it is completely different. Staff can use the time spent on changing frequencies, modifying antennas, and adjusting machines to do more other work. The reliability of communication is also guaranteed. In addition, because the microwave band is wide, there is no problem of overcrowded radio stations.

Now everyone can see dense webs of electric wires in the streets or along the railways, and those wires will increase with the development of the country's industry. There are many wires because the communication equipment uses low frequencies, and only a few telephone and telegraph channels can be accommodated on one line. Some wires cannot be used to transmit television programs. But if you use a waveguide tube with a diameter of only a few centimeters, you can use microwaves to communicate. The number of telephones and telegrams that can pass through this tube is not hundreds or thousands, but tens of thousands. Currently, it can accommodate all the world's television programs.

It can be said that the use of atomic energy would be impossible without radio electronics. Various types of accelerators are the most important equipment for atomic nuclear physics research. Now, electron linear accelerators, microwave electron cyclotron accelerators, proton linear accelerators, etc. are working using microwaves. Using a linear proton accelerator as an injector for a larger accelerator can be used for low-energy and high-energy atomic nuclear physics research, and can also be used to produce isotopes, conduct medical treatment, inspect steel products, and food disinfection.

In addition to the above-mentioned important applications, the research of microwave technology has also promoted the growth of some new disciplines, such as radio astronomy, microwave meteorology, and microwave spectroscopy.

For electromagnetic waves, the atmosphere outside the earth and the ionosphere above it are like a wall that tightly surrounds the earth. On this wall, there are two windows, one of which allows visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared light to pass through. For thousands of years, we have been looking at the universe and understanding celestial objects from this window. But in addition to this, there is another window that allows electromagnetic waves with wavelengths from twenty meters to a few millimeters to pass through. At the same time, there are many stars that can generate radio wave radiation, so we can understand the situation of the stars by studying the situation of these radiation waves. Now many countries are using this method to observe the universe, and many scientists have discovered many new constellations using this method, and call them "radio stars," more correctly, they should be called "radio sources." Most of these constellations cannot be seen by optical methods. Observing the sun in this way allows people to understand the sun better. This method can also be used to observe meteors and other constellations during the day. All of these astronomical data are of great significance for the future realization of spaceflight.

Observing the universe by radio methods is called radio astronomy, and the antenna used is called a radio telescope. In order to obtain very high directivity, this telescope is made very large, sometimes reaching more than one hundred meters in diameter. Secondly, very sensitive special receiving equipment is also required, because the radio radiation from the universe is very weak when it reaches the earth. It is now possible to select radio signals from the universe from noise that is hundreds of times greater than it. But there is still a lot of work to be done in this area. Some of this work is the business of astronomers, but a larger part is the work of microwave technicians.

Due to the development of microwave technology, a new discipline called microwave meteorology has now emerged. Because clouds and raindrops absorb microwaves significantly, and can also partially reflect them back. Scientists are now able to determine the weather conditions within a range of several hundred kilometers, determine the wind speed and direction, rainfall, and cloud distribution at different altitudes, as well as their height and thickness, based on the signals reflected from the clouds and raindrops, helping meteorologists understand the formation of rain, snow, and clouds. This is of great significance for weather forecasting.

Whether it is radio astronomy or microwave meteorology, they have a common feature: they can be carried out day and night, regardless of the season. If these tasks are carried out using other methods, such as optical methods, they will be limited by the weather, while microwave technology is not subject to these restrictions.

Spectroscopy has always been an important method for studying the structure of matter. Before World War II, spectroscopy was limited to the range of visible light, infrared light, ultraviolet light, and X-rays. After the development of microwave ranging technology, microwave spectroscopy has developed rapidly. It provides new and effective methods for studying and processing gaseous, liquid, and solid materials. Currently, we can make a complete set of equipment to generate monochromatic waves of arbitrary wavelengths in the range of a fraction of a millimeter to tens of meters. The bandwidth is about ten octaves, while visible light has only one octave, and it must also be separated from the continuous spectrum by a series of optical instruments such as prism gratings.

The theory of microwave spectroscopy is closely related to theoretical physics, electrodynamics, group theory, and quantum mechanics. At present, its research methods have been applied to all aspects of physics, chemistry, astronomy, and electronics, and have achieved great success.

Using the method of microwave spectroscopy, it is possible to determine the position of atoms in molecules and measure the distance between molecules of substances. In addition, using it to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze gases requires very little mass of the substance, which is of great value to chemistry.

Using ammonia molecules or cesium atomic beams, we can obtain very stable microwave frequencies. Using them to control the swing of clocks, we can obtain very accurate molecular clocks and atomic clocks over a long period of time.

Because there are accurate and stable time and frequency standards, many physical quantities can be measured accurately, such as speed, distance, and so on. Now, advanced industrial countries have widely adopted microwave methods to measure the speed of vehicles in cities to maintain traffic order.

The development of microwave spectroscopy is rapid, and its achievements are great. These achievements promote the discovery of shorter wavelengths and the forward development of frequency multiplication methods. With the help of molecular beams, we can manufacture new types of microwave oscillators and microwave amplifiers with extremely low noise values. The development of microwave technology in this new field and its practical value are inestimable.

    微波技术的新应用
    黄武汉
    微波技术是第二次世界大战前后才发展起来的一门科学，开始它还仅限于军事方面的应用。但是，在短短的十几年中，它已得到非常迅速的发展，现在，微波技术已经广泛地应用到许多科学技术的领域中。今天人们已经开始用无线电电子学发展的水平来衡量一个国家科学技术发展的水平，而微波技术的发展水平，则是衡量无线电电子学发展水平的一个极重要的标准。
    世界各国对微波技术的发展十分重视。在我国科学技术发展的十二年规划中，把无线电电子学的研究，当作一项紧急的重要措施。中国科学院新近筹设的电子学研究所，把微波技术的研究确定为重点研究工作。
    什么是微波技术呢？整个无线电电子学包括的范围很广，使用的波长从几千米一直到零点几毫米。微波就是指波长从十米一直到零点几毫米的波段（有些国家把十米到一米的波段叫超高频，一米以下的叫微波，而苏联则统称为超高频或超短波）。
    人们之所以重视微波技术的发展，是因为微波技术在应用上有以下一些显著的优点：一方面因为现代的雷达、导弹、电视和多路通讯设备等，只有利用微波才可以实现；另一方面，应用微波技术可以减少自然和人为的干扰。一般气候和昼夜的变化，对它的影响也较少，噪声较低。应用体积较小的天线能得到非常尖锐的定向波束。因此，利用微波技术就有可能得到效率高、可靠性大和质量好的传送各种讯号的方法。人们研究无线电电子学，其中一个主要方面是不断地掌握更短的波长。现在无线电科学工作者已经掌握了厘米波的技术，下一步便是掌握毫米波和超毫米波段的新技术了。每一个新的和更短的波段的掌握，必然会带来新的科学成果和重要的技术应用。
    微波技术的应用范围很广，现在仅就其中的几个主要方面介绍如后：
    导弹是目前最新式的武器之一。可是导弹离开了微波，将失去其主要作用。目前军用飞机的速度在一千公里以上，而飞弹、火箭就更快，它们的运动速度使普通的高射炮火根本无能为力。导弹如果利用微波来导向和控制，命中率就很高，可达50％以上。
    雷达目前已经可以在任何时间和任何气候下，在几百公里的范围内测出空中飞行物体的位置。雷达设备与高射炮、探照灯组成严密的自动控制防空网，使敌人的飞机不得逞。在军用飞机上装上雷达，就更能发挥其攻击力量，并可在夜间和敌人作战。如果使雷达工作在更短的毫米波上，那么我们不仅可以确定敌人飞机的方向、距离，还可以看出其大小、形状，辨别其类型和数目。此外，还可以使某些反雷达措施失去作用。同时，装有毫米波雷达设备的飞机，能使飞行员在二百公尺到几公里的距离外观察到飞机场上的地勤工作人员。很明显，这种有如电视一样的雷达，不论在国民经济上或在国防上都是极其重要的。
    利用微波技术还能指导飞机或船只在夜间及恶劣的气候中航行，整个海港的全景在无灯的黑夜中可清晰地映示在雷达的萤光屏上。由于某些航空站和军事上飞行任务的特别繁忙，许多国家已采用了一种自动空中导航系统。它能在几百公里范围内指示出所有所属飞机的位置与距离，并有一百多路微波电话可同时与它们联系，调度它们的交通和升降，因而也能预知这些飞机将来的位置。这种设备都是采用微波技术的。
    在多路通讯和电视中，有些共同的要求，首先要求很宽的通频带，以便容纳大量的电报、电话、广播及电视节目的通路。其次，要求电波传播时少受自然与人为的干扰以及气候与昼夜的影响。所有这些要求只有应用微波技术才能满足。
    以前，当微波技术水平还低的时候，一般微波中继站的传播距离只有一百公里左右。现在科学家已经发现了微波可以把讯号传播到很远的地方，这种传播方法叫做“散射”传播。一些做远距离无线电通讯工作的同志知道，用短波通讯，必须经常地每年每季甚至每日每时地改变通讯的频率。由于强烈的日斑出现，有时甚至无论用什么频率也不能通讯。如果用微波通讯则完全不同，工作人员可以把那些花在换频率、改天线、调机器的时间用来作更多的其它工作。通讯的可靠性也有保证。此外，因为微波波段宽，也就没有电台过挤的问题了。
    现在大家在街头或铁路沿线，都可看到电线密如蛛网，那些电线还会随着国家工业的发展而日益增多。电线多是因为通讯设备使用的频率不高，一条线上只能容纳少数电话、电报通路。有些电线还不能用来传送电视节目。但如果用一条直径仅几厘米的波导管，就可以使用微波来通讯了。这条管中可以通的电话、电报不是几百、几千，而是上万。在目前，全世界的电视节目，它都能容纳得下。
    可以这样说，没有无线电电子学，原子能的利用是不可能的。各式各样的加速器是原子核物理研究方面最重要的设备。现在应用微波来工作的已有电子直线加速器，微波电子回旋加速器，质子直线加速器等。用直线质子加速器来作更大加速器的注入器，就可以作低能及高能的原子核物理研究，也可以用来产生同位素，进行医疗，检查钢铁成品，以及食品消毒等方面的工作。
    微波技术除上述的重要应用外，对它的研究同时又促进了一些新的学科的成长。如射电天文学、微波气象学和微波波谱学等重要学科。
    对于电磁波来说，地球外面的大气层及其上的电离层等有如一道墙，它紧紧地包围着地球。在这道墙上，有两个窗户，其中一个让可见光、紫外线和红外线通过。几千年来，我们就是从这个窗户中去看宇宙，了解天空物体。但除此以外还有另一个窗户，它可以让波长从二十米一直到几个毫米的电磁波通过。同时恰好有很多星球能产生无线电波的辐射，于是我们可以从研究这些辐射波的情况去了解星球的情况。现在有很多国家都用这种方法来观察宇宙，很多科学家已经用这种方法发现了很多新的星座，并且称它们为“无线电星”，更正确地说，它们应称为“射电源”。这些星座的很大部分是用光学方法所看不到的。用这种方法来观察太阳，使人们对太阳了解得更多了。用这种方法还可以在白天观察流星和其他星座。所有这些天文资料对于将来实现宇宙飞行都有很重要的意义。
    用无线电的方法来观察宇宙叫射电天文学，所用的天线叫做射电望远镜。为了要得到很高的方向性，这种望远镜做得很大，直径有时达一百多公尺。其次，还需要非常灵敏的特殊接收设备，因为宇宙中的无线电辐射当到达地球时，都是很弱的。现在已经可以作到把来自宇宙的无线电讯号从大于它几百倍的噪音中选出来。但是这方面还有很多工作要作，这些工作一方面是天文学家的事，而更大一部分则是微波技术人员的工作。
    由于微波技术的发展，现在又出现了一门新的学科，叫做微波气象学。因为云层和雨滴对于微波的吸收很显著，并且又能把它部分地反射回来。科学家们现在已经能根据从云层雨滴上反射来的讯号，判断几百公里区域内天气的情况，确定不同高度的风速与风向、雨量及云层分布，以及它们的高度与厚度，帮助气象学家了解雨、雪和云层的形成。这对气象预报是有很大意义的。
    不论是射电天文学或微波气象学，它们有一个共同特点，就是可以不分昼夜不论季节地进行。这些工作如用其他方法，例如光学的方法，就会受到天气的限制，而用微波技术，则可不受这些限制。
    波谱学对物质结构的研究一直是重要方法之一。在第二次大战以前，波谱学只局限于可见光、红外线、紫外线与伦琴射线的范围以内，在微波测位技术发展之后，微波波谱学有了迅速的发展。它对研究和处理气态、液态、固态的物质提供了新的有效方法。目前我们可以作一整套的设备来产生十分之几毫米到几十米范围内的任意波长的单色波。频宽约为十个倍频程，而可见光只有一个倍频程，并且还须借棱镜光栅等一系列的光学仪器把它从连续光谱中分离出来。
    微波波谱学的理论是与理论物理学、电动力学、群论和量子力学有着密切联系的。目前它的研究方法已应用到物理学、化学、天文学、电子学各个方面，并且取得了很大的成就。
    利用微波波谱学的方法能够确定原子在分子中的位置，量测物质分子间的距离。此外，用它来对气体作定性与定量分析，所要求的物质质量很少，这方面对化学有很大的价值。
    利用氨分子或铯原子束，我们可以获得非常稳定的微波频率，用它们来控制时钟的摆，我们可以得到长时期内非常准确的分子钟和原子钟。
    因为有了准确的与稳定不变的时间与频率标准，因此很多物理量都可以准确地测量出来，例如，速度、距离，等等。现在各先进工业国家已经大量采用微波的方法来测量市内车辆行驶速度以维持交通秩序。
    微波波谱学发展是迅速的，其成就是巨大的。这些成就促使更短波长的发现和倍频方法的向前发展。借助于分子束，我们能够制成新型的微波振荡器和噪声数值极低的微波放大器。微波技术在这新领域中的发展及其实用价值是难以估计的。
