Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd, Moscow, December 22nd (TASS): Hungarian People's Republic Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Armed Forces Ferenc Münnich told a correspondent from the Soviet magazine "New Times" stationed in Budapest that the situation in the Hungarian capital Budapest and Budapest Oblast is becoming more stable. People who had gone astray are now going back to work. Thanks to the measures taken by the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government and the growing dissatisfaction of the masses with the counter-revolution, the underground sabotage activities of the counter-revolution are being suppressed more and more effectively. Special security teams to eliminate the remnants of the counter-revolution have been established and are still being established throughout the country.

The conversation pointed out that representatives of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government maintain regular and close contact with the workers' committees, trade unions, and other social organizations of various industrial enterprises. They frequently go to factories to speak to workers and solicit their opinions on issues to be resolved.

Münnich said that we often receive various kinds of support from residents. Demonstrations demanding the immediate elimination of the remnants of reactionaries were held in Budapest. We receive daily information from residents about counter-revolutionaries hiding weapons. Residents are also actively resisting sporadic armed hooligans and opposing attempts to sabotage railway transportation and urban traffic.

Münnich said that certain international groups want to take advantage of the activities of Hungarian counter-revolutionaries to interfere in the internal affairs of our country. However, the Hungarian people and their government firmly oppose such attempts. We protect our freedom and the achievements of our people in socialist construction, and we will not allow these achievements to be violated.

Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: According to the Hungarian News Agency, the Director of the Hungarian Government Supply Committee, Rezső Nyers, told reporters on December 22nd regarding the national supply situation: He expressed satisfaction with the current supply situation in the capital and the provinces.

He said that so far, food and other goods worth 30 million US dollars have been shipped from various socialist countries, and food and other goods worth 1 million US dollars have been shipped from Western countries through the International Committee of the Red Cross. To ensure normal supply, we need 45,000 railcars of grain for bread. The Soviet Union has already supplied us with 5,000 railcars, and the Soviet Union is also preparing to supply us with 25,000 railcars of grain in the form of goods loans. We also need to import nearly 35,000 railcars of feed. Due to the lack of feed, a large number of livestock, especially pigs, have been slaughtered. In the first half of next year, we will import several thousand tons of cocoa, 600 tons of coffee, 110 tons of tea, and a large quantity of cigarettes and tobacco.

Nyers said that because the food industry can only operate at 90% of its production capacity, and because industrial products have been affected by past shutdowns, we will encounter many difficulties in supply in the first half of next year.

    匈副总理兼武装部队部长明尼赫说
    布达佩斯局面更加安定
    涅尔什说全国物资供应情况有改善
    据新华社23日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科22日讯：匈牙利人民共和国副总理兼武装部队部部长明尼赫对苏联“新时代”杂志驻布达佩斯特派记者说，匈牙利首都布达佩斯和布达佩斯州的情况更加平定了。误入迷途的人已经纷纷去上工。由于工农革命政府采取了措施以及群众对反革命越来越不满，反革命的地下破坏活动越来越有效地被制止住了。全国已经建立、而且还在建立肃清反革命残余的特别保安队。
    谈话中指出，匈牙利工农革命政府的代表同各工业企业的工人委员会、工会和其他社会团体保持着经常的密切联系。他们经常去工厂给工人讲话，并且就有待解决的问题征求他们的意见。
    明尼赫说，我们经常得到居民各种各样的支持。在布达佩斯举行了要求立即肃清反动派残余分子的示威游行。我们每天都从居民那里获得关于反革命分子隐藏武器的消息。居民们还积极地起来反抗零星的武装流氓，并且反对破坏铁路运输和城市交通的企图。
    明尼赫说，国际上某些集团想乘匈牙利反革命分子活动的机会来干涉我们国家的内政。但是，匈牙利人民和他们的政府坚决反对这种企图。我们保护我们的自由和我们人民在社会主义建设方面所获得的成果，我们不容许侵犯这些成果。
    新华社23日讯　据匈牙利通讯社报道，匈牙利政府供应委员会主任雷热·涅尔什22日就全国供应情况告诉记者们说：他对于目前首都和外省的供应情况表示满意。
    他说，到目前为止，从各社会主义国家运来了价值三千万美元的食品和其他物品，通过红十字国际委员会从西方国家运来价值一百万美元的食品和其他物品。为了保证供应正常，我们需要四万五千车皮谷物来做面包，苏联已经供应了我们五千车皮，苏联还准备以货物借贷形式供给我们两万五千车皮谷物。我们还需要进口将近三万五千车皮饲料。由于缺乏饲料，已经宰杀了大量牲畜，特别是猪。我们在明年上半年将进口几千吨可可，六百吨咖啡，一百一十吨茶叶和大量的香烟和烟草。
    涅尔什说，由于食品工业只有90％的生产能力能够开工，由于工业品受到了过去停工的影响，明年上半年在供应方面将遇到很多困难。
