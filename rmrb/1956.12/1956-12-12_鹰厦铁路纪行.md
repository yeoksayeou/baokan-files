A Journey Along the Yingxia Railway
(Continued from yesterday)
By our reporter Shang Kai

The Gold-Laden Banks of the Futun River

After the train passed Guangze, the rain grew heavier. Raindrops streamed down the train window, obscuring the distant mountains in a misty haze. At this time, the train was winding its way along the turbulent Futun River. The river water pounded against the rocks in the valley, creating a thunderous roar. Lumberjacks, wearing conical hats and palm-fiber raincoats, used huge bamboo poles to guide strings of logs downstream. Here, one could see the unique scenery of the mountainous Fujian Province.

The Futun River originates on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi provinces, collecting streams from Jianning, Taining, Jiangle, and other counties, rushing through the high mountains and valleys of Guangze, Shaowu, Shunchang, Nanping, and other counties, and is one of the three main sources of the Min River. The Yingxia Railway runs southeast along the Futun River, turns a corner at Waiyang in Nanping County, and then ascends the Sha River, extending into the misty mountains of western Fujian. The Futun River basin, located around the 27th parallel north latitude, has no severe heat or cold throughout the year, abundant rainfall, and fertile soil. The humus on the surface is several inches thick, and the topsoil layer is more than three feet deep, suitable for the growth of various plants. Trees that take 100 to 150 years to grow in the Northeast only need 20 to 25 years to mature here.

From the train, the distant mountains and valleys along the Futun River are lush green, often shrouded in clouds and mist, adding a touch of mystery. In this vast sea of forests, thousands of species of trees grow, including Chinese fir with straight grains and strong texture, Masson pine with rich oil content that "remains intact after a thousand years in water," precious Phoebe zhennan that is "difficult to burn in fire and difficult to decay in water" and can be used to make sophisticated instruments, and fragrant camphor and Dalbergia hupeana with beautiful patterns that can be used to make exquisite furniture. In the boundless bamboo forests, there grow moso bamboo that can replace steel bars and be used as scaffolding, and bitter bamboo, Phyllostachys heterocycla and thin-walled bamboo for making daily necessities. In the deep mountains of this area, tens of thousands of dan of bamboo silk and cardboard, and millions of jin of pine resin, camphor, tung oil, tea oil, and castor oil can be produced every year, all of which are important raw materials for industrial production. In addition, the shiitake mushrooms, dried bamboo shoots, tea, flue-cured tobacco, jute, and various medicinal materials produced here are also very famous. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to call the banks of the Futun River "the treasure trove of Fujian's local specialties."

However, the people living along the "treasure trove" - the Futun River - did not live prosperous lives in the past. Due to inconvenient transportation and high freight rates, many local specialties were worthless. The masses said painfully: "A Chinese fir tree is not as valuable as a moso bamboo, and a moso bamboo is not as valuable as a sugarcane." Therefore, tall trees could only be left to rot on the mountains, and large tracts of bamboo forests had to be left to grow and die on their own. Many precious pine, fir, and miscellaneous trees were painfully cut down and burned as firewood.

In less than half a year since the northern section of the Yingxia Railway was opened to traffic, the economic life of the people along the Futun River has become active. Things that were worthless in the past are now valuable. A moso bamboo sells for 6 jiao, a sleeper sells for 7 yuan, and even bamboo branches and leaves that no one wanted for firewood in the past have now become hot commodities. The Shunchang County Committee of the Communist Party of China seized the agricultural slack season before the autumn harvest and mobilized 8,000 laborers throughout the county to engage in sideline production such as logging, bamboo cutting, pine resin collection, and charcoal burning. In September alone, they produced 200,000 yuan, with an average income of 25 yuan per person. Now, the farmers have completely changed their pessimistic views of the past and describe their mountainous areas as: "The mountains are full of treasures, and gold is everywhere."

From the platforms and warehouses of large and small stations along the line, one can see piles of wood, bamboo, shiitake mushrooms, dried bamboo shoots, medicinal materials, etc., waiting to be loaded and transported. In Guangze, Shaowu, Shunchang, Nanping, and other places, there are many procurement personnel from state-owned enterprises and construction sites in Shanghai, Tianjin, Xi'an, Shenyang, Harbin, and other places, who live here for a long time to purchase wood, bamboo, and various local specialties, truly creating a situation of "gathering merchants." According to incomplete statistics, since the beginning of this year, various economic departments have purchased nearly 1.5 million yuan of wood, bamboo, shiitake mushrooms, and dried bamboo shoots in Shunchang County alone, and have also signed contracts to supply another 200,000 moso bamboo, 30,000 dan of bitter bamboo and Phyllostachys heterocycla, and 45,000 pieces of wooden boards and bamboo boards by the end of the year, worth more than 300,000 yuan.

In the "Heartland"

From Shunchang, via Sha County, to Yong'an. From Yong'an, take a car along the winding mountain road, going up and down. One moment we climbed to the top of the ridge, and the next moment we descended into the valley. The railway subgrade alongside us, like a yellow earth dragon, sometimes left us and hid behind the jungle, and sometimes suddenly appeared in front of us after circling around the mountain. At this time, the weather was clear, and white clouds were floating and swirling in the mountain valleys and among the peaks like strands of light gauze. Deep green streams rose with a vast expanse of water mist. It was as if we had entered the "fairy palace world" of mythology. This is the Daiyun mountainous area, known as the "heartland" of the Yingxia Railway.

The car drove onto a hilltop that had been shaved off, and newly laid steel rails lay stretched out in the sunlight like two silver snakes. It was quiet all around. All that could be seen now were broken rope ends, broken dustpans, and the marks of various car tires and bulldozer tracks. Obviously, a fierce battle had taken place here not long ago. Comrade Zhong Jinhuan, the car driver, told us that this was one of the largest and most complex key projects on the entire line - the Gongziwan construction site. In the days when the road-building heroes were fighting hard at Gongziwan, Zhong Jinhuan was also an excellent driver. Now he excitedly told us about the scene at that time, pointing out to us where there used to be a mountain dozens of meters high that had now been cut off, and where there used to be a deep valley dozens of meters deep that had now been filled in... At this time, I remembered an interesting figure that a comrade in the headquarters of the Railway Corps told me: in the one-kilometer area of Gongziwan, four mountain peaks had to be dug out and three valleys nearly 40 meters deep had to be filled in. The entire project involved a total of 640,000 cubic meters of earth and stone, including both digging and filling. If these earth and stone were piled into a subgrade one meter high and one meter wide, it would be almost as long as the Yingxia Railway.

The car crossed several more mountains alongside the railway and arrived at the highest point of the Daiyun mountainous area - the watershed. The watershed stretches for hundreds of miles and has hindered transportation between southern and northern Fujian for centuries. The Yingxia Railway passes through here. Because the rock quality was not good, it was inconvenient to build a tunnel, so they had to chisel straight down from the top of the ridge, creating a road cut 700 meters long, 30 meters deep, and 20 meters wide. Before construction began, the road-building heroes had sworn loudly at the watershed: "With road-building heroes here, how can the high mountains not bow their heads." Sure enough, after 210 days and nights of fierce fighting, the high mountain ridge was split in half, allowing the rail-laying team to pass through smoothly. Now the battle here has long ended, and we had to sit in this deep and long road cut, listening to Yang Fasheng, the deputy squad leader of a certain company of the Railway Corps, tell us with relish the heroic stories of their battle at the watershed a month ago.

Not far past the watershed, there is a range of mountains covered by late-stage virgin forests, called Chitouban. Here, cliffs are connected to cliffs, and precipices are connected to precipices. The roadbed winds through these cliffs and precipices, 60 or 70 meters above the valley floor. When we arrived, the railway soldiers were building a bridge halfway up the mountain. Looking up, the bridge-building soldiers seemed to be attached to the sky. The wind blew and the clouds moved, and the mountains seemed to be turning as well. The people on the ground already felt a little dizzy, but the bridge-building soldiers were walking freely on the suspended steel beams. Zhang Wanxiu, an engineer from the Railway Corps, led us on a tour while introducing us to the large-scale blasting construction method used for this section of the roadbed. He said: "There wasn't even a small path for people to walk here before. During construction, the soldiers and laborers climbed up steep cliffs that even monkeys found difficult to climb, hung hundreds of safety ropes, suspended their bodies in the clouds in mid-air, and used iron hammers and steel chisels to dig hundreds of pilot holes, fill them with hundreds of kilograms of explosives, and with a few rumbles, half a mountain peak flew away at a time. Look," we looked in the direction he pointed, and saw that the opposite hillside was full of rocks and charred tree trunks. The small trees and grass buried underneath had already sprouted tender green shoots. Zhang Wanxiu said: "The large-scale blasting construction method played a decisive role in the early completion of the Yingxia Road."

While we were talking, the sharp sound of a whistle came, and an engineering train rumbled from halfway up the mountain. Looking up from below, white clouds lined with billowing black smoke – what a beautiful shot!

The Beautiful Land of Flowers and Fruits - The Jiulong River Basin

The railway passes through the complex terrain of the late-stage virgin forest area and extends downhill, arriving at Zhangping. Several noisy streams originating from the southern foothills of the Daiyun Mountains converge under the city of Zhangping and flow southeast, which is the Jiulong River, known for its beautiful scenery. The Yingxia Railway extends here and seems to have formed a sisterhood with the Jiulong River, advancing together inseparable. After passing Hua'an, the high mountains on both sides slowly recede into the distance, the river surface gradually spreads out, and the roaring river water becomes as clear as a mirror, appearing so gentle. Looking at the banks of the river from the train, orchards are connected to rice paddies, and rice paddies are connected to orchards. At this time, the season for picking lychees had just passed, the longans were ripe with full branches, golden grapefruits bent the branches, and strings of bananas hung heavily.

That day, we arrived in Zhangzhou City, the seat of the Longxi Special District. Zhangzhou City is a beautiful city with a southern flavor. Many buildings have deep red walls and white doors and windows, or light yellow walls and light blue doors and windows, surrounded by clumps of greenery like velvet balls. Broad banana leaves protrude from the walls of many houses, which is very unique. In the evening, we strolled through the central area of Zhangzhou City, and the streets were full of fruit stalls! Ripe bananas, peeled grapefruits and pineapples, exuded a tempting aroma. Tourists couldn't resist its allure and couldn't help but indulge in a feast.

"The people who live in this land of fruit are truly blessed." People who come to the Jiulong River basin for the first time almost utter the same sigh. But, friends, when you are eating these plump and sweet fruits, who would have thought that the people of this beautiful land of fruit had experienced a tragic ordeal? Most of the people along the Jiulong River have always relied on fruit production to maintain their livelihoods. However, as early as before the Anti-Japanese War, this was the sphere of influence of Japanese imperialism. Cheap bananas from Taiwan flooded the market. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Chiang Kai-shek clique relied on American imperialism, and American "Florida tangerines" were dumped here in large quantities. The fruit farmers along the Jiulong River were squeezed to the point where they could hardly breathe. In their anger, they could only painfully cut down the fruit trees and burn them as firewood. After the liberation in 1949, with the support of the People's Government, the fruit farmers along the Jiulong River gradually restored fruit production, and the output increased year by year. However, due to inconvenient transportation and difficulties in shipping it out, undue losses resulted. According to a survey by the Commercial Section of the Longxi Special District, in 1954, the entire area produced 210,000 dan of bananas. At the beginning of the market, the purchase price per dan was 5.1 yuan. Later, because a large number of self-produced and self-sold bananas flooded the market, the state-owned commercial departments were unable to purchase them, and the price fell to 2 yuan per dan. The fruit farmers suffered heavy losses, and their production enthusiasm was severely hit. In 1955, banana production dropped by 30%, and in individual counties such as Hua'an, it dropped by 50%. In 1956, the banana production in the entire area decreased by another 40% compared with 1955. Other fruits that were not easy to store had similar situations.

Now the Yingxia Railway is about to open to traffic. At that time, the fruits of the Jiulong River basin will be entirely transported by train. This will not only shorten the transportation time and reduce losses, but also greatly reduce the freight rate due to the low cost of train transportation. What will follow will be a high tide of fruit production. The Longxi Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has estimated the new changes that this new situation will bring about, and is conducting comprehensive planning and arrangements for the development of fruit production.

    鹰厦铁路纪行
    （续昨）

    黄金遍地的富屯溪沿岸
    车过光泽以后，雨越下越大了。雨珠沿着车窗的玻璃一直往下流，远近的山峦被掩没在迷蒙蒙的云雾里。这时候，列车正沿着湍急的富屯溪蜿蜒前进。溪水冲激着山谷中的乱石，发出雷鸣般的巨响，木材拨运工人，戴着斗笠，披着棕衣，用巨大的竹篙撑着一串串的木排，顺流而过。在这里看到了福建山区特有的景色。
    富屯溪发源于闽赣边境，汇集了建宁、泰宁、将乐等县的溪流，奔腾在光泽、邵武、顺昌、南平等县的高山峡谷中，为闽江三大主要源流之一。鹰厦铁路沿着富屯溪东南行，到南平县的外洋转一个弯，又溯沙溪而上，伸入闽西雾蒙蒙的群山中。富屯溪流域，在北纬二十七度线南北，全年无酷暑严寒，雨量充足，土地肥沃。地表面的腐植质有好几寸厚，壤土层有三尺多深，适合各种植物的生长。在东北需要一百年到一百五十年长大的树木，在这里只要二十年到二十五年就能成材。
    从火车上望去，富屯溪沿岸的远山近谷一片苍翠，经常有云雾缭绕其间，增加了几分神秘的气氛。在这广大的林海里，生长着几千种树木，其中有纹理通直、材质坚韧的杉木，有含有丰富的油脂、“水浸千年”也不腐烂的马尾松，有“遇火难烧，遇水难朽”、可制精巧仪器的名贵楠木，有气味芳香花纹美丽、可作精美家具的樟木和花榈。在漫无边际的竹林里，生长着可以代替钢筋并作脚手架用的毛竹，有制作日常生活用品的苦竹、石竹和绵竹。在这一带的深山里，每年还能生产成万担的竹丝、纸板，千百万斤的松脂、樟脑、桐油、茶油和蓖麻子油，这都是工业生产上的重要原料。此外，这里盛产的香菇、笋干、茶叶、烤烟、黄麻和各种药材，也很著名。所以人们把富屯溪沿岸称为“福建土特产的宝库”，这话不能算作过誉。
    但是，生长在这“宝库”——富屯溪沿岸的人民，过去的生活并不富裕。因为交通不便，运价昂贵，许多土特产品一文不值。群众痛心地说：“一根杉木不如一根毛竹值钱，一根毛竹不如一根甘蔗值钱。”因此，高大的树木只有让它在山上腐烂，成片的竹林也只好由它自生自灭，许多名贵的松、杉、杂木被忍痛地砍来当柴烧。
    鹰厦铁路北段通车不到半年，富屯溪沿岸人民的经济生活便活跃起来了。过去不值钱的东西，现在都值钱了，一根毛竹卖到六角，一根枕木卖到七元，就连过去当柴烧都没有人要的竹枝竹叶，现在也成了热货。中共顺昌县委曾抓紧秋收前的农闲期间，在全县发动了八千个劳动力从事伐木、砍竹、采松脂、烧木炭等副业生产；9月份一个月就生产了二十万元，平均每人收入二十五元。现在农民已完全改变了过去的悲观论调，把他们的山区形容为：“满山都是宝，遍地皆黄金。”
    从沿线大小车站的站台上、仓库里，可以看到到处都是堆积如山的木材、毛竹、香菇、笋干、药材等，正准备装车外运。在光泽、邵武、顺昌、南平等地，住满了来自上海、天津、西安、沈阳、哈尔滨等地国营企业和建筑工地的采购人员，他们长期住在这里采购木材、毛竹和各种土特产品，真有“客商云集”之势。据不完全的统计，今年以来，各经济部门仅在顺昌一个县便采购了将近一百五十万元的木材、竹类、香菇和笋干，另外还签订了到年底再供应二十万根毛竹、三万担苦竹和石竹、四万五千只木头板、竹头板的合同，共值三十余万元。
    在“心脏地带”
    从顺昌经沙县，到了永安。离永安，乘汽车沿着盘山公路上下回转。一会儿爬上了岭顶，一会儿又降落到峡谷。和我们傍行的铁路路基，好像一条黄色的土龙、有时离开我们，隐藏到丛林背后去了，有时候又绕过山岗突然出现在我们面前。这时候，天气晴朗，白色的云雾像成缕的轻纱一样，在山坳里浮沉，在群峰间缭绕，深绿色的涧流，腾起白茫茫的水雾。我们好像进入了神话中的“仙宫世界”。这里，就是被称为鹰厦铁路“心脏地带”的戴云山区。
    汽车开上一片被削掉头的山岗，新铺好了的钢轨，像两条银蛇一样，舒展地躺在阳光里。周围静悄悄的。现在所看到的只有破绳头、破箕子，还有各种汽车轮胎和推土机履带的印子。显然，不久以前，这里曾进行过一场炽烈的战斗。汽车司机钟金焕同志告诉我们说，这就是全线最大而又最复杂的重点工程之一——宫子湾工地。在筑路英雄们大战宫子湾的日子里，钟金焕也是一名出色的司机。现在他兴奋地给我们讲述当时的情景，指给我们，哪里原是几十公尺高的山头，现在被削掉了，哪里原是几十公尺深的大谷，现在被填平了……这时候我想起了铁道兵司令部里的一个同志告诉给我的一个有趣的数字：在宫子湾一公里的地区内，要挖掉四座山头，填平三处近四十公尺深的山谷，全部工程连填带挖，共六十四万土石方。如果把这些土石方堆成高宽各一公尺的路基，差不多等于鹰厦铁路一样长。
    汽车傍着铁路再翻过几座大山，便到了戴云山区的最高点——分水岭。分水岭绵亘数百里，多少世纪以来就阻碍着闽南和闽北的交通。鹰厦铁路通过这里，由于石质不好，不便开洞，只有从岭顶一直往下凿去，凿出一条七百公尺长，三十公尺深，二十公尺宽的路堑。在动工以前，筑路英雄们曾对着这分水岭高声宣誓：“有得筑路英雄在，高山那能不低头。”果然，经过了二百一十个昼夜的激战，便将这座高峻的山岭劈成了两半，让铺轨大队顺利地通了过去。现在这里的战斗早已结束，我们只好坐在这又深又长的路堑里，听着铁道兵某连的副班长杨发胜同志，津津有味地讲述他们一个月前大战分水岭的英雄故事。
    穿过分水岭不远，有一片为后期原始森林覆盖着的山峦，地名叫作赤头坂。这里悬崖连着悬崖，峭壁接着峭壁，路基便在这离谷底六七十公尺高的悬崖峭壁上盘转通过。我们走到的时候，铁道战士正在半山腰里架桥，仰望上去，架桥的战士们像是紧贴在天空，风吹云移，山峦似乎也在转动，地面上的人已经感到有点晕眩，但是架桥的战士们却在悬空的钢梁上行走自如。铁道兵团工程师张万秀，一边领我们参观，一边向我们介绍这段路基采用大爆破施工的情形。他说：“这里原来连条人行小道都没有，施工的时候，战士和民工爬上了猴子也难攀登的陡壁，挂下了成百条保险索，把身子悬在半空云雾中，手执铁锤钢钎，打出了成百条导洞，填装了几百斤炸药，轰隆了几声，半个山头半个山头地飞走了。你们看，”我们顺着他手指的方向看去，只见对面山坡上，满是乱石和烧焦了的树干，埋在下边的小树和青草，已经又抽出了嫩绿的新芽。张万秀说：“大爆破的施工方法，对提前修通鹰厦路起了决定作用。”
    正谈话间，传来了一声汽笛的尖叫声，工程列车从半山腰里隆隆开来。从下望去，翩翩白云衬着滚滚黑烟，多么美的一个镜头啊！
    美丽的花果之乡—九龙江流域
    铁路穿过地形复杂的后期原始森林地带，沿着下坡伸展，到了漳平。发源于戴云山南麓的几条喧闹着的溪流，汇集在漳平城下，奔腾着向东南流去，这就是素以风景优美著称的九龙江。鹰厦铁路伸展到这里，像是和九龙江结成了姊妹一样，形影不离地相依前进。过华安以后，两旁的高山慢慢地向远方退去，江面渐渐地铺展开来，咆哮着的江水也变得平明如镜，显得那样温和，从车中眺望大江两岸，果园连着稻田，稻田又接着果园。这时候，收摘荔枝的季节刚刚过去，满枝累累的桂圆又熟了，黄澄澄的柚子压弯了枝干，成串的香蕉沉甸甸的下垂着。
    当天，我们到了龙溪专署所在地——漳州市。漳州市是一座美丽的具有南国风味的城市，许多建筑物，都是深红色的墙壁，白色的门窗，或者是浅黄色的墙壁，淡蓝色的门窗，被绿绒球似的树丛簇拥着。宽阔的芭蕉叶子，探出许多宅院的墙头，显得非常别致。晚上浏览了漳州市的中心区，满街都是水果摊子！熟透了的香蕉，剥了皮的柚子和菠萝，散发着阵阵诱人的香气，游人禁不住它的引诱，不免都要大吃一顿。
    “生长在这水果之乡的人们真是太幸福了。”初到九龙江流域的人们，几乎发出同样的赞叹。但是，朋友们，当你们吃着这些肥硕香甜的水果的时候，谁会想到这美丽的水果之乡的人民，曾经历过一段悲惨的遭遇。九龙江沿岸大部分的人民从来都是靠果产维持生活。但是，远在抗日战争以前，这里就是日本帝国主义的势力范围，台湾的廉价香蕉充斥着市场；抗日战争胜利以后，蒋介石集团投靠了美帝国主义，美国的“花旗蜜桔”又在这里大量倾销，九龙江沿岸的果农，被挤得喘不过气来，他们于愤怒之余，只有忍痛把果树砍掉了当柴烧。1949年解放以后，九龙江沿岸的果农，在人民政府的扶持下，又逐渐恢复了果品生产，产量逐年增加，但是，由于交通不便，外运困难，结果造成了不应有的损失。据龙溪专署商业科调查，1954年全区产香蕉二十一万担，开始上市时，每担收购价格为五元一角，后因自产自销者大量流入市场，国营商业部门无力收购，价格跌到每担二元，果农亏本很大，生产情绪受到严重打击，到1955年香蕉产量便下降了30％，个别的县如华安则下降了50％。1956年全区香蕉产量又比1955年下降了40％。其他不易存储的水果也有类似情况。
    现在鹰厦铁路就要通车了，到那时候，九龙江流域的水果将完全改由火车装运，不但可以缩短运输时间，减少损耗，而且由于火车运费低廉，运价也会大大降低，跟着而来的将是果品生产的高潮。中共龙溪地委估计到了这一新形势将引起的新变化，对发展果品生产正在进行全面的规划和安排。　（未完）
