Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 9th: Qian Changzhao and He Jifeng, representatives of the National People's Congress, concluded their inspection in Shandong Province today.

Qian Changzhao and He Jifeng mainly inspected water conservancy projects in Shandong Province. After inspecting the Dayuzhang Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project, He Jifeng believed that Shandong Province's technical strength in water conservancy projects was insufficient, and it is necessary to actively cultivate technical personnel in the future. Relevant central agencies should also help Shandong Province solve this problem. He also believed that it is necessary to quickly teach farmers the skills of using and managing irrigation canals so that they can smoothly divert water to irrigate farmland and increase agricultural output. After inspecting the Wuhe Hydropower Station in Huantai County, they suggested that the local government appropriately raise the water level to increase power generation capacity based on hydrological conditions.

During their inspection, Qian Changzhao and He Jifeng criticized the shortcomings in Shandong Province's work. They believed that the inverted siphon channel project in the lower reaches of the Yellow River was not well maintained, and the effectiveness of these inverted siphon projects was not being realized. They requested provincial-level agencies to take measures to strengthen maintenance work. The two representatives also pointed out that there were extravagant and wasteful phenomena at the water release ceremony of the Dayuzhang Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project. Their opinions have been taken seriously by relevant departments in Shandong Province.

Qian Changzhao and He Jifeng also inspected ditch-ridge fields and flood prevention projects in the Liaocheng area. Local farmers reported to them that this area used to suffer from waterlogging disasters, but since the construction of ditch-ridge fields last winter, they have achieved a bumper harvest this year. They also inspected the well irrigation project in Huantai County with great interest. This project uses the method of excavating underground channels and digging wells in the places where the underground channels pass to divert water from the Wuhe River to irrigate farmland. With this water conservancy project and proper fertilization, local farmers have achieved a value of wheat, corn, and cabbage equivalent to 1,500 jin of grain per mu per year. Qian Changzhao believed that the well irrigation project was very effective, and He Jifeng expressed admiration for the ability of Shandong farmers to complete this arduous water conservancy project and produce more grain for the country.

During their stay in Shandong, Qian Changzhao and He Jifeng also inspected the planned dam site and nearby terrain in the Dongping Lake area; and inspected the Sihe River and other irrigation projects in the Jining area. While in Liaocheng, they were very concerned about the situation of the people affected by the breach of the Weiyun River this summer and the government's relief work.

Qian Changzhao and He Jifeng arrived in Shandong on November 21. Other representatives of the National People's Congress who have recently come to Shandong Province for inspection include Luo Shuzhang, Shi Zhe, Zhang Yunyi, Duan Junyi, Zhang Zhiyi, and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Zhang Fang, Wu Xiaobang, and Yuan Hanqing.

　　钱昌照、何基沣结束视察工作
　　对山东水利建设提出批评建议
    新华社济南9日电　全国人民代表大会代表钱昌照、何基沣今天结束了在山东省的视察。
    钱昌照、何基沣在山东省主要视察了水利工程。何基沣在视察了打渔张引黄灌溉工程后，认为山东省水利工程的技术力量不足，今后必须积极培养技术人才，中央有关机关也应该帮助山东省来解决这个问题。他还认为必须迅速地把使用和管理灌溉渠的技能教给农民，使农民能够顺利地引水灌溉农田，提高农业产量。他们在桓台县视察了乌河水电站后，根据水文情况，建议当地政府适当地提高水位，以增加发电能量。
    钱昌照、何基沣在视察时对山东省工作中的缺点提出了批评。他们认为黄河下游虹吸渠道工程保养得不好，没有发挥这些虹吸工程的效用，要求省级机关采取措施，加强保养工作。这两位代表还指出打渔张引黄灌溉工程放水典礼有铺张浪费现象。他们的意见受到了山东省有关方面的重视。
    钱昌照和何基沣还到聊城专区视察了沟洫畦田和防涝工程。当地农民向他们反映，这个地区过去常常遭受水涝灾害，自从去年冬天修建了沟洫畦田后，今年就获得了丰收。他们还以很大的兴趣视察了桓台县的井灌工程，这个工程是用开凿地下渠道和在地下渠道流经的地方打井的办法，引乌河的水灌溉农田。当地农民由于有了这个水利工程，加以施肥得当，使每亩土地每年收获的小麦、玉米、白菜的价值折合粮食达一千五百斤之多。钱昌照认为井灌工程的效能很大，何基沣对山东农民能够完成这个艰巨的水利工程，为国家增产更多的粮食，表示钦佩。
    钱昌照、何基沣在山东期间，还到东平湖地区视察了计划中的坝址和附近的地形情况；到济宁专区视察了泗河等灌溉工程。他们在聊城时，十分关心在今年夏天由于卫运河决口而受灾的人民的情况以及政府救济工作的情况。
    钱昌照和何基沣是在11月21日到达山东的。在最近到山东省视察的还有全国人民代表大会代表罗叔章、师哲、张云逸、段君毅、张执一和中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会委员张钫、吴晓邦、袁翰青等。
