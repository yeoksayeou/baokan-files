Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an Dispatch: The first Shaanxi Province Small Business Representative Meeting, held not long ago, is one of the important steps in Shaanxi Province to properly prepare for the comprehensive opening of state-led free markets.

    The meeting discussed the scope of the state-led free market opening, prices, farmer trade, and market management issues. The representatives had a clearer understanding of the scope of local and special products opened by Shaanxi Province based on local conditions; and believed that small businesses everywhere should, according to the scope prescribed by the state and the law of commodity circulation, go deep into mountainous areas and remote villages to operate all possible local products. On prices, the representatives realized that, although the state allows free negotiation and free transaction, all small businesses should strive to increase income from improving and expanding operations, and should not arbitrarily raise prices or lower prices, seeking exorbitant profits. At present, more than 80% of small businesses in Shaanxi Province participating in various forms of socialist transformation should strengthen self-transformation to ensure a better role in managing local and special products, under the condition of completing state procurement tasks and continuing to stabilize prices. Representatives from Hu County and Ningqiang and other places pointed out that the current restrictions on small businesses' free transportation and free purchase are still very serious, and requested relevant departments to change this. Representatives from Baishui, Yao County, Lintong, Fengxiang and other counties pointed out that in these areas there are many farmers engaged in purely commercial activities, even engaging in black market activities, and hoped that relevant departments would strengthen the leadership of farmer trade.

    The meeting also studied the further resolution of the supply problem for small businesses. The representatives suggested that in the future, small businesses should regularly and proactively report to wholesale units on the needs of the masses, and provide suggestions for improving business.

    陕西召开小商贩代表会议讲明市场政策
    为开放自由市场做妥善准备
    据新华社西安电　不久以前举行的陕西省第一次小商小贩代表会议，是陕西省为全面开放国家领导的自由市场妥善作好准备工作的重要步骤之一。
    会议讨论了国家领导的自由市场开放范围、价格、农民贸易和市场管理等问题。代表们对陕西省根据当地情况而制订的土产品、特产品开放范围有了较明确的认识；并认为各地小商小贩都应该根据国家规定的开放范围和商品的流转规律，深入山区和偏僻乡村，把可能经营的小土产都经营起来。在价格上，代表们认识到，虽然国家允许自由议价、自由成交的方式，但所有的小商小贩都应该从改善和扩大经营方面争取增加收入，不应任意抬价压价、贪图暴利。目前，陕西全省参加社会主义各种改造形式的十分之八以上的小商贩，更应加强自我改造，保证在国家收购任务完成和继续稳定物价的条件下，更好地发挥经营土产品和特产品的积极作用。鄠县、宁强等地代表提出目前当地限制小商小贩自由贩运自由进货还很严重的情况，要求有关部门加以改变。白水、耀县、临潼、凤翔等县代表提出在这些地区有不少农民从事纯商业活动，甚至进行黑市活动，希望有关部门加强对农民贸易的领导。
    会议还对进一步解决小商小贩的货源问题进行了研究。代表们提出，今后小商小贩要经常主动地向批发单位反映群众需要情况，提供改进业务的意见。
