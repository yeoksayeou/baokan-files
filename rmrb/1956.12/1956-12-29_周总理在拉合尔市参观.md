Xinhua News Agency, Lahore, December 28th: Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their entourage watched a fireworks display with the citizens of Lahore on the evening of the 27th. Dozens of lanterns floated in the night sky, and Jinna Garden was shrouded in an unpredictable light.

The Chinese Premier and Vice Premier sat with their Pakistani hosts on the club's veranda. Under the intermittent, intense flames and flashes of light, a large crowd of dark figures could be seen, including veiled women, some sitting, some standing, forming a large circle around the club.

In the center of the circle, various beautifully designed and colorful fireworks were launched in succession, dazzling the spectators. Some fireworks resembled rockets, others fountains; there were spinning fire wheels, and slowly rising Chinese characters expressing welcome; some were like suspended stars, others like enchantingly beautiful trees. Finally, dozens of balloons were released into the night sky, swaying in the air like lanterns.

Premier Zhou and his party applauded enthusiastically for the spectacular fireworks display. Thousands of spectators erupted in thunderous cheers. The joy of the guests and hosts merged into one.

Before the performance began, Premier Zhou strolled around the garden, visiting and meeting with people. People cheered slogans of "Long Live Sino-Pakistani Friendship!"

Accompanying Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long to watch the fireworks display were Pakistani Foreign Minister Noon, West Pakistan Governor Gurmani, the Chinese and Pakistani ambassadors, and other senior officials.

Before the fireworks display, the West Pakistan government hosted a banquet in honor of Premier Zhou Enlai.

At noon on the same day, Premier Zhou Enlai reviewed a military band composed of hundreds of people selected from bands and drummers. In the afternoon, Premier Zhou and his party visited Aitchison College. They toured various parts of the college, watched students play cricket and hockey, and students perform dance programs.

Xinhua News Agency, Lahore, December 27th: On the morning of the second day of their visit to the ancient city of Lahore, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long visited the Batala Engineering Company and the tomb of Emperor Jahangir.

When they arrived at Pakistan's largest machine manufacturing plant, the Batala Engineering Company, hundreds of workers and their children welcomed the distinguished guests at the gate, which was adorned with the national flags of Pakistan and China, and a huge banner reading: "Your visit will strengthen the friendship between Pakistan and China."

The factory's General Manager, Latif, who visited China earlier this year, accompanied the Chinese guests on a tour of the various departments of the factory, which produces lathes, diesel engines, pumps, and other machinery. The factory hopes to import some steel from China, and it has already produced several lathes based on trial orders placed by China. Latif said he hoped China would send a technical delegation to the Batala factory. He said: "Such exchanges of delegations would help further strengthen the relationship between our two countries' industrial enterprises."

Premier Zhou said: "We are happy to send a delegation of technicians to this very outstanding machine factory. I think we can learn a lot of useful things here."

Recalling his visit to China, Latif said that the Chinese people were making great strides in industrial, agricultural, commercial, and cultural construction. Everyone in China, from the Chairman to the farmers, is working very honestly. He said: "In my opinion, this is what makes China a powerful force."

The Chinese guests traveled by car from the Batala Engineering Company to the tomb of Mughal Emperor Jahangir. As they passed through dense crowds, people welcomed the guests with smiles and applause, and shouted "Zindabad" (Long Live) to China and Pakistan. As a sign of welcome to the most distinguished guests, red soil was laid on the road leading to the tomb. The mausoleum, built over ten years, is one of the most beautiful Mughal monuments on the Indian-Pakistani subcontinent.

After watching a performance by a large military band, the Chinese guests had lunch with Pakistani Foreign Minister Noon.

The Chinese guests will visit colleges and attend a banquet hosted by the West Pakistan government this afternoon, and they will travel to East Pakistan tomorrow. (Attached picture)

    周总理在拉合尔市参观
    新华社拉合尔28日电　周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和随行人员27日晚上同拉合尔市民一起观看了焰火表演。黑夜的天空中点缀着几十盏临空飘荡的灯笼，真纳花园笼罩在一片变幻莫测的光亮里。
    中国总理和副总理同巴基斯坦主人们一起坐在俱乐部的走廊上。在一阵阵断断续续的强烈的火焰和闪光的照耀下，可以看到一大片黑黝黝的人群，其中还有带着面纱的妇女，有的坐着，有的站着，在俱乐部四周围成很大一个圆圈。
    人圈的中央接连射出了各种各样设计得很美妙的五彩缤纷的焰火，照耀得观看的人眼花缭乱。有的焰火酷似火箭，有的像喷泉；有旋转不已的火轮，也有徐徐上升的表示欢迎的中国文字；有的像悬荡的明星，有的像美得迷人的树木。最后，几十只气球放上了夜空，像灯笼一样在空中荡漾。
    周总理等一行对这场精采的焰火表演热烈鼓掌。成千成百的观众发出了雷动的欢呼声。宾主的喜悦汇合在一起。
    在表演开始以前，周总理在花园里转了一圈，四处参观并且同人们会见。人们欢呼“中巴友谊万岁！”的口号。
    陪同周恩来总理和贺龙副总理参观焰火表演的有巴基斯坦外交部长努恩、西巴基斯坦省长顾尔马尼、中巴两国大使和其他高级官员。
    在焰火表演以前，西巴基斯坦政府设宴招待了周恩来总理。
    同一天中午，周恩来总理检阅了从管乐队和鼓手选出来的数百人组成的军乐队。下午，周总理等一行参观了埃契森学院。他们参观了这个学院的各个部分，观看学生们打板球和曲棍球以及学生们演出的舞蹈节目。
    新华社拉合尔27日电　周恩来总理、贺龙副总理在访问古城拉合尔的第二天的上午，参观了巴塔拉机器制造厂和日汉哲皇帝的陵墓。
    当他们到达巴基斯坦最大的机器制造厂——巴塔拉机器制造厂的时候，成百上千的工人和他们的孩子在大门口欢迎贵宾，大门上挂着巴中两国的国旗，还有一幅巨大的标语写着：“您们的访问会加强巴中两国的友谊。”
    曾经在今年访问过中国的工厂总经理拉蒂夫陪同中国客人们参观了这家生产车床、柴油机、抽水机和其他机器的工厂的各个部门。这家工厂希望从中国进口一些钢材，它并且已经根据中国所提出的试用订单而生产出几架车床。拉蒂夫说，他希望中国派一个技术代表团到巴塔拉工厂来。他说：“这样互派代表团会有助于进一步加强我们两国的工业企业之间的关系。”
    周总理说：“我们乐于派一个技术人员的代表团到这个十分出色的机器厂来。我想我们可以在这里学到很多有用的东西。”
    拉蒂夫在回忆访问中国的情况时说，中国人民在工业、农业、商业和文化建设等方面正在大踏步地前进。中国的每一个人，从主席到农民，都在非常老老实实地工作。他说：“据我看来，这就是使中国变为强大的力量的东西。”
    中国客人乘汽车从巴塔拉机器制造厂到莫卧儿帝国皇帝日汉哲的坟墓。在穿过密集的人群时，人们用微笑和掌声来欢迎客人，并高呼中国巴基斯坦“津达巴”（万岁）。欢迎最高贵的宾客的标记，红土铺在通往坟墓的道路上。这个坟墓是由皇帝的儿子沙日汉在十七世纪初期建筑的。用十年功夫建成的坟墓上的灵庙，是印度—巴基斯坦次大陆上最美丽的莫卧儿纪念物之一。
    中国客人们在观看了军队大型乐队的表演以后，同巴基斯坦外交部长努恩共进午餐。
    中国客人们今天下午将参观学院和出席西巴基斯坦政府举行的宴会，他们将在明天前往东巴基斯坦。（附图片）
