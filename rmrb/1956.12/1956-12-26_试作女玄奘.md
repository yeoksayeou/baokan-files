Attempting to Be a Female Xuanzang
Zǐ Gāng
On December 14th, the Chinese women's delegation, invited by the Indian government, left Beijing. The plane circled over Beijing, allowing us a rare glimpse of the capital's sunrise. A patch of red-purple morning glow rose from the eastern plain, and in an instant, sunlight streamed into the plane's window. The plane headed southwest.

In just seven or eight hours of flight, we saw the chimneys of factories in Taiyuan, the first snow in Xi'an; the waiting room in Chongqing was installing stoves, but upon arriving in Kunming, our winter clothes were completely unsuitable. People on the streets were wearing padded jackets and single trousers.

We went from fifteen degrees below zero in Beijing to spring-like Kunming, truly arriving in the evening after departing in the morning. During this journey, my mind traveled through twenty centuries, from the Han Dynasty (more than 100 BC) when Emperor Wu sent Zhang Qian to explore the Western Regions, to the Jin Dynasty (5th century) when Faxian visited India, especially thinking of Xuanzang in the Tang Dynasty (7th century) who stayed in India for more than ten years. He not only obtained Buddhist scriptures (and mobilized some people to translate them with him after returning, a translation that took more than ten years), but also brought back valuable elements from ancient Indian culture, including literature, art, medicine, astronomy, mathematics, and customs.

No wonder Premier Zhou told overseas Chinese during his trip to India: everyone should learn from Xuanzang. I think he was referring to Xuanzang's spirit of humbly learning and deeply researching. Before going abroad, Xuanzang studied the languages of India and the Western Regions. His "going abroad" also involved many struggles, and he finally obtained permission from the Turkic Yehu Qaghan to enter India through the Western Regions. The journey alone took a year, facing the dangers of freezing, starvation, and being hit by blizzards, with nearly half of his companions dying. He spent more than ten years in India, traversing various Buddhist holy sites and visiting many scholars in various fields. He traveled from North India to the East, South, and West, with his main place of study being naturally Nalanda Monastery, which was not only a Buddhist monastery but also a place for the transmission of Indian literature and science. Xuanzang's return to China can truly be said to be "successful completion of studies." Discussing the history of that time, one cannot help but feel infinitely yearning for the grand lecture meeting in Kanyakubja before Xuanzang's return to China.

The friendly and cultural exchange between the one billion people of China and India has been brought to our daily agenda. This is a major event concerning Asian and world peace. On the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Indian people are flourishing. We are visiting India following the footsteps of Premier Zhou and Vice Premier He, and many more delegations will arrive. The essence of India's long history, the excellent creations of the nation, and certain strengths in modern economy and culture will all be objects of our learning.

Although the women's delegation is small, with only nine delegates and three interpreters, we are guests of the Indian government and Indian women. A three-week visit may be too rushed to compare with Xuanzang's ten years of hard work, but we will still "sincerely be twelve good guests, representing 300 million Chinese women to learn. Indian women have made many outstanding achievements in the national independence movement, in national construction, in cultural work, and in women and children's welfare work.

On the way to India, Xuanzang's deeds filled me with endless remembrance. Our ancestors were so intelligent and tirelessly eager to learn. There were many travelers in history like Xuanzang, all driven by a burning desire for knowledge, traveling at home and abroad, climbing mountains and wading through rivers under difficult material conditions in ancient times. And today, we arrive in Kunming in one morning and evening; in another one or two mornings and evenings, we can reach Calcutta—our first travel destination.

The Chinese women's delegation includes a judicial officer, a food industry officer, a textile factory director, a hospital president, women's federation workers… In just three weeks, we will attempt to be modern female Xuanzangs.

    试作女玄奘
    子冈
    12月14日这一天，应印度政府邀请的中国妇女代表团离开了北京。飞机在北京上空回旋，使我们难得看到首都的日出，一片红紫的朝霞在东边平地而起，顷刻间阳光射进了机窗，飞机向西南行进。
    仅仅七、八小时的飞行，使我们看到了太原工厂的烟囱，西安全城的初雪；重庆候机室正在安炉子，而到了昆明，我们的冬装完全不能适应了，街上的人都穿着棉袄单裤。
    我们从零下十五度的北京来到了四季如春的昆明，真可以说是朝发夕至。在这一路上，我的脑子却在作二十个世纪的旅行，从公元前一百多年汉武帝派张骞通西域，到晋朝（五世纪）法显访印，尤其想到唐朝（七世纪）玄奘在印度一住十几年，他不只取得了佛经（回国后动员些人和他合译，一译又是十几年），而且也带回了印度古文化中的宝贵东西，文学、艺术、医学、天文、数学以及风俗人情各方面，无不涉猎。
    难怪周总理这次旅印时曾向华侨说：应该人人学玄奘。我想指的是玄奘的虚心学习，深入钻研的精神。玄奘在出国之前就学习印度和西域诸国的语言，“出国”也经过了多番斗争，最后得到突厥叶护可汗的允许，才通过西域诸国进入印度。路上一走就是一年，历经冻死、饿死和被暴风雪砸死的危险，同行的人死去小半。他在印度十几年，足迹遍历各佛教圣地，也访了各方面的许多学者。他由北印度跑到东、南、西部，主要的进修地点自然是那烂陀寺，这里不仅是佛教寺院，而且也是印度的文学科学传授之所。而玄奘之归国，真可说是“学成”，谈谈当时历史，令人对当年曲女城玄奘归国前的讲学大会，无限神往。
    中、印十亿人民友好和文化交流，已提到我们的生活日程上来了，这是有关亚洲和世界和平的大事，在五项原则的基础上，中印人民的友好往还方兴未艾。我们随着周总理、贺副总理的足迹访问印度，还有许多代表团也将到达。印度悠久历史中的精粹、民族的优秀创造，以及近代经济、文化中的某些长处，都将是我们学习的对象。
    虽然妇女代表团很小，只有九个代表和三个译员，来作为印度政府和印度妇女的客人。三星期的参观访问也许太匆忙，不能同玄奘的十几年苦功相比，但是我们仍将“诚恳地作十二个好客人，代表三亿中国妇女去学习。印度妇女在民族独立运动中，在祖国建设中，在文化工作中，在妇女儿童福利工作中，是有很多卓越成绩的。
    在赴印的途中，玄奘的事迹使我缅怀无已。我们的祖先是多么聪慧和好学不倦，历史上像玄奘一样的旅行家还很多，都是被热烈的求知愿望所驱使，在国内国外奔波，在古代艰难的物质条件下爬山涉水。而我们今天，一个朝发夕至，到了昆明；再有一两个朝发夕至，就可以到加尔各答——我们第一个旅行终点。
    中国妇女代表团里有司法负责人、食品工业负责人、纺织厂厂长、医院院长、妇联工作者……在短短三星期中，我们将试作现代女玄奘。
