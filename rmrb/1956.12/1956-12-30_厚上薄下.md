    Lavish Above, Meager Below
    Cadres of the CCP Jianli County Committee in Hubei Province have no dining hall. Many cadres eat in a square, and when it is cold, all available sheltered places are crowded. When it rains, everyone has to hold an umbrella in one hand and carry food to the office or dormitory hundreds of steps away to eat. Cadres have raised concerns and created a budget for building a dining hall, but the leadership emphasized "thrift" and cancelled the budget.
    At the same time, however, 400 yuan was spent to renovate the county committee office building, making it look brand new. Renovating the office is not necessarily a waste, of course, but since there were still funds, why not first find a way to build a shelter from wind and rain for everyone to eat in? (Meng Lang)

    厚上薄下
    中共湖北监利县委会干部没有饭厅，许多个干部在一个广场上吃饭，天冷时，凡可避风的地方都挤满了人。下雨时，大家只好一只手撑伞，一只手拿着饭菜到数百步外的办公室或宿舍去吃。干部提过意见，也造了建饭厅的预算，但领导上强调“节约”，把这笔预算取消了。
    与此同时，却花了四百元把县委会办公楼房粉刷得焕然一新。粉刷办公的地方当然不一定是浪费，可是既然还有经费，为什么不先想办法给大家修一个遮风避雨的饭棚子？　（孟浪）
