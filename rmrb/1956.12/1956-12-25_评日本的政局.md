　　On the Japanese Political Situation

　　Japan has formally restored diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, and subsequently, Japan has been accepted into the United Nations as its eightieth member state. This marks a turning point in Japan's post-war diplomacy and a significant advance in the Japanese people's struggle against American control and for independence. Simultaneously, the Hatoyama Cabinet, under the strong demands of the Japanese people for an independent and autonomous policy and the increasingly sharp internal contradictions within the ruling party, announced its resignation on the 20th of this month. The new president of the Liberal Democratic Party, Tanzan Ishibashi, has succeeded Hatoyama as the Prime Minister of Japan and has formed a new cabinet. Where will Japan go from here? What are the political trends in Japan? These are the questions of concern to everyone at present.

　　In recent years, Japan's political situation has been undergoing profound changes: on the one hand, the United States and a few pro-American factions in Japan are trying to intensify the revival of Japanese militarism and implement various reactionary policies that violate the interests of the Japanese nation, seriously threatening the interests of all strata of the Japanese people. On the other hand, the Japanese nation is increasingly unable to tolerate being in a semi-occupied state by the United States, and the Japanese people's struggle to break away from American control and implement an independent and autonomous policy is becoming more widespread and profound. Not only is anti-American sentiment increasingly developing among the broad masses of the Japanese people, but also the demands for national independence are gradually growing among the middle and small bourgeoisie, and even some of the big bourgeoisie. The contradiction between American imperialism and the Japanese nation has become the most important and realistic contradiction in Japan's current political life.

　　With the development of the contradictions between Japan and the United States, new changes have also taken place in Japan's domestic class relations. The struggle between the broad patriotic forces who advocate an independent policy and the few pro-American factions in Japan is becoming increasingly acute. The Japanese government's implementation of reactionary policies that are subservient to the United States and violate the interests of the Japanese nation has been met with increasingly strong dissatisfaction and resistance from the broad patriotic forces in Japan. The forced collapse of the Yoshida Cabinet in December 1954 marked the fact that Yoshida's policy of complete subservience to the United States could no longer be sustained. The subsequent Hatoyama Cabinet, under the pressure of the rising anti-American sentiment among the Japanese people, could not but begin to change the Yoshida Cabinet's policy of leaning completely to the United States. After two reorganizations, the Hatoyama Cabinet walked a bumpy and tortuous road, finally fulfilling its promise to restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, and also promoting some exchanges with China.

　　However, the Hatoyama Cabinet reflected even more the dependence of certain large Japanese capitalist groups on the United States. Under pressure from the United States and extreme pro-American factions in Japan, it delayed the Japan-Soviet negotiations for a long time, adopted a passive attitude towards the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, and, in terms of domestic policy, accelerated the rearmament of Japan and suppressed the national democratic movement of the Japanese people. This could not but arouse dissatisfaction among the broad strata of the Japanese people. At the same time, on the issue of the restoration of Japan-Soviet diplomatic relations, Hatoyama was also attacked by the Yoshida faction, and other factions within the Conservative Party also wanted to seize Hatoyama's leadership position. Under these circumstances, the Hatoyama Cabinet faced a crisis of collapse in the second half of this year. Later, it was only because Hatoyama turned to a more positive attitude on the issue of the restoration of Japan-Soviet diplomatic relations that he temporarily delayed the offensives from all sides to overthrow the cabinet. After the completion of the Japan-Soviet diplomatic negotiations, the struggle among the various factions within the Conservative Party to seize power became acute again. The Socialist Party also prepared to seize power after the Japanese Diet approved the Japan-Soviet restoration of diplomatic relations. Hatoyama was finally forced to step down in the face of offensives from all sides to overthrow the cabinet.

　　Tanzan Ishibashi, the new Prime Minister of Japan, had been "purged" by the American occupation authorities in the past. Later, as the Minister of International Trade and Industry in the Hatoyama Cabinet, he was also dissatisfied with American control over Japan, especially the American embargo restrictions on trade. In November of this year, he opposed the American plan to restrict Japanese cotton textile imports into the American market. Before and after Ishibashi came to power, while stating his intention to maintain friendly relations with the United States, he also advocated revising the "Japan-U.S. Security Treaty" to "adjust Japan-U.S. relations," and expressed his intention to develop trade relations with China and the Soviet Union. It can be seen from this that from the collapse of the Yoshida Cabinet, the crisis of the Hatoyama Cabinet to the establishment of the Ishibashi Cabinet, it marks that the forces inclined to "independence and autonomy" have gradually strengthened in Japanese political life. This is reflected in Japanese diplomacy as a shift from a policy of leaning completely to the United States to restoring diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, from signing the Security Treaty with the United States in 1951 to now demanding the revision of this unequal treaty. This change undoubtedly has a profound impact on the development of the Japanese political situation. In this reorganization of the Japanese cabinet, the Yoshida faction, with the support of the United States, tried to split the Conservative Party and reorganize a pro-American government, but this was not only opposed by all parties, but also failed to obtain the active support of the Japanese zaibatsu, and finally had to declare failure. This fact shows that it is becoming increasingly difficult for the United States to reverse the historical trend of Japan moving towards "independence and autonomy" and return to the old path of Yoshida.

　　Inejiro Asanuma, the Secretary-General of the Japanese Socialist Party, issued a statement after Ishibashi was elected president of the Liberal Democratic Party, demanding that Ishibashi revise the pro-American policies pursued by the past government and implement an independent and autonomous diplomacy. He believes that Japan should make special efforts to restore diplomatic relations with China as soon as possible and establish closer political and economic relations with Southeast Asian countries. He said that after Japan joins the United Nations, it will play a bridge role between the two major camps in the East and West, and its voice in the international community will also be expanded. Therefore, the time has come for Japan to make a major shift in its diplomacy. The Socialist Party's call is worthy of the Ishibashi Cabinet's attention.

　　The Japanese people have waged a heroic struggle for independence, peace, democracy, and the improvement of economic life with unyielding perseverance. This is something the Japanese nation can be proud of, and it is also the hope for the future of the Japanese nation! All the efforts of the Japanese people to safeguard peace and independence will receive the warm sympathy and strong support of peace-loving and justice-upholding countries around the world, especially the Chinese people. It is worth noting that the United States and certain forces in Japan that betray national interests are continuing to take various reactionary measures in an attempt to suppress the just struggle of the Japanese people. Those who faithfully safeguard the interests of the Japanese nation must be vigilant against this conspiracy.

　　American control and interference in Japan in military, political, and economic terms is the greatest concern of the Japanese nation today. It is precisely because of this pressure from the United States that Tanzan Ishibashi, in explaining his policy guidelines, while expressing his intention to "adjust Japan-U.S. relations" and pointing out that there are many areas that need to be "corrected" by the United States, also asked the United States to dispel its "misunderstandings" of him and endure American restrictions. He declared that he is "willing to take the United States as the leader" and said that "Japan will never establish diplomatic relations with communist China regardless of the free world." This attitude is not significantly different from that of the past Hatoyama Cabinet. In fact, the expansion of Sino-Japanese trade and the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations are entirely within the scope of Japanese sovereignty and absolutely cannot be allowed to be interfered with by the United States. The United States looks very fierce, but in reality, it is just a paper tiger. It not only should not, but also cannot, decide the affairs of Asia. As one of the major countries in Asia, and a historically independent Japanese nation, it not only should but also can independently decide its own foreign policy. As long as the Japanese government truly implements policies that conform to the interests of the Japanese nation and receive the support of the entire Japanese people, the American conspiracy to interfere in Japan can be defeated. As long as Japan resolutely establishes friendly relations with its neighbors, the Soviet Union and China, it can most effectively strengthen its independent position in its relations with the United States and realize its desire for independence and autonomy. This not only conforms to the interests of the entire Japanese nation but also benefits peace in the Far East and the world.

　　The Chinese people and the Chinese government have always advocated establishing friendly relations with all countries that share the same aspirations, including our neighbor Japan, based on the five principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. The Chinese people and the Chinese government, in order to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, have taken the initiative to adopt measures to resolve issues of trade, overseas Chinese, and Japanese war criminals with Japan. However, the Japanese government has not made corresponding efforts in the past. Although Sino-Japanese relations have improved somewhat in recent years due to the joint efforts of the Chinese and Japanese people, it is still far from enough. The normalization of Sino-Japanese relations is the common desire of the Chinese and Japanese people. As long as the Japanese government can bravely implement an independent policy that conforms to its own national interests, it is not difficult to gradually achieve it. Whether the Ishibashi Cabinet can overcome all difficulties and pursue a policy that conforms to the interests of the Japanese nation and the wishes of the broad masses of the Japanese people on this important issue will be a serious test for the Ishibashi Cabinet.

### 评日本的政局

    评日本的政局
    日本同苏联已经正式恢复邦交，接着日本便被联合国接纳为第八十个会员国。这是日本战后外交的一个转折点，也是日本民族反对美国的控制和争取独立斗争的一个重要的进展。与此同时，鸠山内阁已于本月20日在日本人民强烈要求执行独立自主的政策和执政党内部矛盾日益尖锐的情况下宣告辞职了。自由民主党的新任总裁石桥湛山接替鸠山为日本的首相，并且已经组成了新内阁。今后日本究竟走向何处去？日本的政治动向究竟如何？这是当前大家所关心的问题。
    这些年来，日本的政局正在发生着深刻的变化：一方面，美国和少数日本亲美派力图加紧复活日本军国主义，实行种种违反日本民族利益的反动政策，严重地威胁着日本各阶层人民的利益。另一方面，日本民族越来越不能忍受处于被美国半占领的地位，日本人民要求摆脱美国控制、实行独立自主政策的斗争越来越广泛而深入，不仅在日本广大人民群众中间日益发展着普遍的反美情绪，而且在中、小资产阶级以至部分大资产阶级中间也逐渐增长着民族独立的要求。美帝国主义同日本民族的矛盾，已成为当前日本政治生活中最主要和最现实的矛盾。
    随着日美矛盾的发展，日本国内的阶级关系也发生了新的变化。主张采取独立政策的广泛爱国势力同日本少数亲美派之间的斗争，正日益尖锐化。日本政府执行屈从美国、违背日本民族利益的反动政策，已经遭到日本广大爱国势力的日益强烈的不满和反抗。1954年12月吉田内阁的被迫倒台，标志着吉田所执行的完全屈从美国的政策，已难以继续下去。接着登台的鸠山内阁，在日本人民日益高涨的反美情绪的压力之下，不能不开始改变吉田内阁向美国一边倒的政策。鸠山内阁经过二次改组，摇摇摆摆地走了崎岖曲折的道路，终于实现了恢复日苏邦交的诺言，同时也促进了同中国的某些来往。
    但是鸠山内阁却更多地反映了日本某些大资产阶级集团对美国的依赖性。它在美国及日本极端亲美派的压力下，把日苏谈判拖延了很长时间，并对中日关系正常化的问题采取了消极态度，在对内政策方面则加速重新武装日本，压制日本人民的民族民主运动。这就不能不引起日本广大阶层的不满。同时，在日苏复交问题上，鸠山又受到吉田派的攻击，保守党内部其他各派系也想夺取鸠山的领导地位。在这种情况下，鸠山内阁在今年下半年就面临着倒台的危机。后来只是由于鸠山对日苏复交问题转而采取了比较积极的态度，才暂时延缓了各方面倒阁的攻势。日苏复交谈判完成后，保守党内部各派系争夺地位的斗争重又尖锐化起来。社会党也准备在日本国会批准苏日复交后夺取政权。鸠山在各方面的倒阁攻势中，终于被迫下台了。
    新出任日本首相的石桥湛山，过去曾遭到美国占领当局的“整肃”，后来在鸠山内阁中担任通商产业相时，也不满美国对日本的控制，尤其不满美国对贸易的禁运限制。在今年11月，他曾经反对美国限制日本棉织品输入美国市场的计划。石桥上台前后，在他声明要保持同美国的友好关系的同时，也主张修改“日美安全保障条约”，以“调整日美关系”，并表示要同中苏发展贸易关系。由此可见，从吉田内阁的倒台，鸠山内阁的危机到石桥内阁的成立，标志着倾向“独立自主”的势力在日本政治生活中的地位已经逐步加强起来。这表现在日本外交上就是从向美国一边倒的政策转而同苏联恢复邦交，从1951年同美国签订安全保障条约进而到现在的要求修改这个不平等条约。这个变化对日本政局的发展无疑具有深刻的影响。在这次日本内阁的改组中，吉田派在美国的支持下，曾力图分裂保守党和重组亲美政府，但是这不但遭到各方的反对，而且也没有取得日本大财阀的积极支持，终于不得不宣告失败。这一事实表明美国要扭转日本走向“独立自主”的历史车轮，倒回吉田的老路是愈来愈困难了。
    日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎在石桥当选自由民主党总裁后，曾发表谈话，要求石桥修改过去政府所推行的追随美国的政策，实行独立自主的外交。他认为日本应该作出特别的努力，早日同中国恢复外交关系，并且同东南亚国家建立更加密切的政治和经济关系。他说，日本加入联合国之后，将对东西两大阵营起桥梁作用，并且在国际间的发言权也将得到扩大。因此日本在外交上需要来一个大转变的时期已经到来。社会党的这种呼声，是值得石桥内阁加以重视的。
    日本人民不屈不挠地为独立、和平、民主和经济生活的改善进行了英勇的斗争。这是日本民族可以自豪的地方，这也是日本民族未来的希望！日本人民为维护和平和独立的一切努力，将会得到全世界爱好和平和主持正义的国家、特别是中国人民的热烈同情和有力支持。值得注意的是，美国及日本出卖民族利益的某些势力，正在继续采取各种反动措施，力图镇压日本人民的正义斗争。忠诚维护日本民族利益的人士，对这种阴谋是不能不加以警惕的。
    美国在军事上、政治上、经济上对日本的控制和干涉，是当前日本民族的最大忧患。正是由于美国的这种压力，石桥湛山在说明他的施政方针时，虽然一方面表示要“调整日美关系”，指出很多地方是需要美国“修正”的。但在另一方面，他又要求美国消除对他的“误解”而忍受美国的限制，他声明“愿意以美国为领导者”，说“日本绝不会不顾自由国家而同共产党中国建立邦交”。这种态度同过去的鸠山内阁并无显著的差别。其实，关于扩展中日贸易和中日邦交的恢复问题，这完全是日本主权范围以内的事情，绝对不能容许美国来干涉。美国看来很凶，实际上不过是一只纸老虎，它不仅不应当而且也无力来决定亚洲的事务。作为亚洲大国之一，而且在历史上一直是独立的日本民族，不仅应当而且也可能独立自主地决定自己的外交政策。只要日本政府真正执行符合日本民族利益的政策，得到日本全国人民的支持，美国干涉日本的阴谋就可以击败。只要日本坚决同自己的邻邦苏联和中国建立友好关系，就可以最有效地加强它同美国关系中的独立地位，就可以实现其独立自主的愿望。这不仅符合日本整个民族的利益，而且也有利于远东和世界的和平。
    中国人民和中国政府一直主张根据相互尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处五项原则，同一切具有同样愿望的国家建立友好关系，包括我们的邻邦日本在内。中国人民和中国政府为了促进中日关系的正常化，曾主动地采取措施同日本解决贸易、侨民和日本战争犯罪分子的问题。但是过去日本政府却没有做出相应的努力。虽然中日关系在几年来由于中日人民的共同努力已有了一些改进，但还是很不够的。中日关系的正常化是中日两国人民的共同愿望，只要日本政府能够勇敢地执行符合自己民族利益的独立政策，那是不难逐步实现的。石桥内阁在这一重要问题上是否能够排除一切困难，奉行符合日本民族利益和日本广大人民愿望的政策，这将是对石桥内阁的一个严重考验。
