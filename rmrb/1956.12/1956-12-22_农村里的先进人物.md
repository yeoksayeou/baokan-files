Advanced Figures in the Countryside

In Pixian County, Over 400 Agricultural Cooperatives Select a Large Number of Advanced Producers

Recently, thousands of ordinary farmers and rural workers have become well-known figures in the countryside of Pixian County, Sichuan Province. From the end of November to mid-December, they were selected by over 400 agricultural cooperatives in the county as advanced producers and advanced workers.

The ranks of the advanced are extensive. They include not only those who have achieved significant increases in the production of crops such as rice, wheat, and rapeseed, but also experts in cattle raising, pig farming, beekeeping, fertilizer accumulation, seedling cultivation, and the use of new agricultural implements. Agricultural cooperative cadres who are good at organizing production, excellent nursery group caregivers, and civil school teachers were also elected as advanced workers.

The advanced individuals made outstanding contributions during the agricultural production upsurge. Li Buyun, an advanced producer from Tuanjie Township, was the first person to grow double-cropping rice locally. As a production team leader of an agricultural cooperative, he motivated the members of his team with his own production activities, rushing to harvest and transplant, completing the task of growing two seasons of rice from planting to harvesting in more than 170 days. He broke the old convention that double-cropping rice could not be grown locally due to the short frost-free period and harvested more than 960 jin of rice on more than 11 mu of double-cropping rice fields, including 2.6 mu, which created a record of 1,097 jin per mu. Zhou Shaoxian, an advanced producer from the Second Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Xipu Township, is a good farmer who achieved "four harvests a year." This year, he implemented rational intercropping on a piece of 1.35 mu of land and harvested a total of 4,793 jin of corn, spring potatoes, and sweet potatoes, and also planted a season of winter turnips (green manure crops), with a total output value of 148 yuan, more than twice the income of ordinary fields in the area.

Pixian County's agricultural cooperatives launched activities to select advanced agricultural producers and advanced workers after preliminary summarizing this year's production experience. The person in charge of the Rural Work Department of the Pixian County Committee of the Communist Party of China told reporters that the purpose of carrying out this work was to correct the phenomenon of blindly shouting that advanced experience was not good and the lack of production enthusiasm that had appeared in some places. Since the launch of this work, that confused thinking has been basically clarified, and the enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers to vigorously carry out production movements has been encouraged. In Xipu Township of this county, some people originally negated many of the advanced experiences promoted this year. Through this selection activity, hundreds of advanced producers exchanged their successful experiences in promoting advanced experiences, so the farmers in the township affirmed: of the 17 yield-increasing measures promoted this year, in addition to the three that need to continue to be tested, the others can be widely promoted.

More Than 100 Model Members Emerge from Three Agricultural Cooperatives in Huangzhuang Township

The Huangzhuang Township Branch of the Communist Party of China in Junan County, Shandong Province, often pays attention to strengthening the political and ideological education of its members. This year, 147 members of the township were named production models and love-the-cooperative models. These models were given material rewards such as iron shovels, towels, and study notebooks at the recent year-end production summary conference of the township.

Huangzhuang Township was formed last autumn by merging and expanding 17 elementary cooperatives into three advanced agricultural cooperatives. In the early days of the establishment of the advanced cooperatives, some cooperative cadres believed that as long as production was done well, other things could be asked less or not done; some members did not care enough about the cooperative's public property, believing that large agricultural tools and other major means of production had been collectively owned, and it was irrelevant to them to damage or lose a little; there were also hundreds of draught animals and pigs that generally lost weight and died without anyone managing them. After discovering these situations, the township branch immediately studied and organized an exhibition, exhibiting various good and bad examples, and conducted ideological education on "taking the cooperative as home" for the members. Later, the township branch often used methods such as cultivating typical examples and comparing good and bad in production, which strengthened the members' collectivist ideology and paid attention to protecting the cooperative's public property.

The secretary of the Huangzhuang Township Party Branch told reporters: The crops planted by the three agricultural cooperatives in our township have achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest this year, and 90% of the members have increased their income. The advanced figures have played a great role in achieving these achievements. During the wheat harvest, there were continuous rains, and Wang Chechao of the Fourth Production Team of the Red Star Cooperative promptly proposed the suggestion of "rush harvesting, rush drying, and rush threshing," which prevented the loss of mildew in more than 300 mu of wheat in the entire team. Fu Shuqi of Guangming Cooperative did not pay attention to protecting public property in the past, but after education, he could actively check and put away various agricultural tools, regardless of day or night, whenever it was cloudy or rainy. Fu Yan'yi, the feeder of this cooperative, was initially irresponsible in his work. The pigs he fed were very thin, and he didn't care even if some died. He also changed after education. For example, on a cold night in February this year, fearing that the few piglets that had just been born would freeze to death, he held the piglets on the kang and covered them with his only cotton-padded coat, but he was so cold that he couldn't sleep.

Peace Cooperative Rewards Work Well Done by Team Leaders Based on Members' Opinions

Twenty-three of the fifty production team leaders of the Peace Agricultural Cooperative in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, received rewards of five to fifteen labor days respectively. The members believed that these production team leaders were responsible in their work and had done less labor days due to official duties and should be given subsidies.

Cao Huicun, who received a subsidy, has always performed well and taken the lead in all aspects of his work. For example, during the autumn harvest, he got up early to clean up the site and wait for the members to come to thresh the rice. When people dispersed in the evening, he always held an oil lamp and carefully swept the rice grains on the field, sweeping up several jin each time. Another example is Tu Jinlin. The production team he is responsible for is the team that has done the best in the cooperative in terms of protecting agricultural tools, farm boats, and draught animals. Because Tu Jinlin sets an example, the members cherish public property as if it were their own. Gong Baoxing, Tu Genlin, and other four member families had difficulties in life. Tu Jinlin immediately went to the cooperative to discuss with the cadres and borrowed 20 yuan for them, which improved their enthusiasm for production. Everyone said that the production team's production achievements are inseparable from the leadership of the team leader. (Xinhua News Agency)

Enshi Prefecture Rewards Cadres Loved by Farmers in Eight Counties

Recently, eight counties in Enshi Prefecture, Hubei Province, commended and rewarded a group of cadres who were deeply loved by the farmers. Xuanen County selected more than 330 model agricultural cooperative directors and district and township cadre activists. In addition to selecting a large number of model cadres, Jianshi County also selected a model township.

Among the cadres who were commended and rewarded, the cadres of the Third District of Xuanen County seriously summarized and promoted the experience of drought-resistant seedling cultivation in Mahuping Township in accordance with local conditions, so that the hundreds of mu of double-cropping rice that were tried to be planted this year achieved increased production. Tan Rujia, the secretary of the Chacha Erxiang Branch of the Communist Party of China in Badong County, relied on the masses and insisted on promoting advanced technology, and finally created a high-yield record of 1,000 jin of rice and 10,000 jin of potatoes per mu in the remote high mountains.

Caring for the lives of the masses and adhering to the principle of diligence and thrift in running cooperatives are the common characteristics of these rewarded cadres. Huang Shande, the secretary of the Dali Township Branch of the Communist Party of China in Jianshi County, solved the problem of fertilizer shortage in the township after deeply interviewing old farmers and finding an old coal mine that had been unknown for many years. He also helped 11 households in the Gaochao Agricultural Cooperative who were in difficulty to arrange work, and now nine households have become surplus grain households. Yang Zaishen, the director of the Shuihong Agricultural Cooperative in Meiziping Township, Xianfeng County, visited 120 members and found that 55 members had no money to buy pigs. Therefore, he discussed with the cooperative committee to lend dozens of piglets from the cooperative to the members for feeding, and the members were all satisfied.

    农村里的先进人物
    郫县四百多个农业社评选出大批先进生产者
    数以千计的普通农民和农村工作者，最近成为四川省郫县农村知名的人物。他们是在11月底到12月中旬，由全县四百多个农业社分别选出的先进生产者和先进工作者。
    先进者的队伍很广泛。其中，不但有种植水稻、小麦、油菜等作物增产显著的人，还有牧牛、养猪、养蜂、积肥、育苗和使用新式农具的能手。善于组织生产的农业社干部，优秀的托儿组保育员和民校教师，也当选为先进工作者。
    先进者们在农业生产高潮中出色地贡献了自己的力量。团结乡先进生产者李步云是当地第一次种双季稻的人。他是一个农业社的生产队长，因为他以自己的生产活动带动本队社员，抢收抢插，在一百七十多天内完成两季水稻从栽到收的任务，打破了当地无霜期较短不能种两季稻的陈规，并且在十一亩多双季稻田里收了九百六十多斤稻谷，其中有二点六亩，还创造每亩产一千零九十七斤的纪录。犀浦乡第二高级农业社先进生产者周绍贤，是一个做到“一年四收”的好庄稼人。今年，他在一块一点三五亩的土地上实行合理间作，就收了玉米、春马铃薯、甘薯共四千七百九十三斤，还种了一季冬苕（绿肥作物），总产值共有一百四十八元，高出当地一般田里的收入两倍以上。
    郫县各农业社开展评选农村先进生产者和先进工作者的活动，是在初步总结今年生产经验之后进行的。中共郫县县委会农村工作部负责人对记者说，进行这项工作的目的，是为了纠正有些地方曾经出现的盲目叫喊先进经验不好和生产劲头不足的现象。自从开展这一工作后，已经基本澄清了那种混乱的思想，鼓舞了广大农民努力开展生产运动的情绪。这个县的犀浦乡，原来有些人对今年推广的很多先进经验一律否定，这次通过评选活动，有几百个先进生产者交流了推广先进经验成功的经验，这样乡里农民就肯定：今年推广的十七项增产措施，除了三项还要继续试验以外，其他的都可以大量推广。

    黄庄乡三个农业社涌现一百多名模范社员
    中共山东省莒南县黄庄乡支部经常注意加强对社员的政治思想教育工作，这个乡今年有一百四十七名社员被评为生产模范和爱社模范。这些模范在最近召开的全乡年终生产总结大会上，分别得到铁锨、毛巾和学习本等物质奖励。
    黄庄乡在去年秋季由十七处初级社合并扩大为三个高级农业社，高级社成立初期，有些社干部认为只要把生产搞好，其他事情可以少问或不做；有的社员对社里公共财产爱护不够，认为大型农具等主要生产资料已归集体所有，损害和丢失一点与自己无关；还出现数百头耕畜、生猪普遍跌膘和死亡等无人管理的现象。乡支部发现这些情况后，立即研究筹办了展览会，展出各种好坏事例，向社员进行“以社为家”的思想教育。以后，乡支部在生产中又经常用培养典型、好坏对比等方法进行教育，这样就加强了社员的集体主义思想，注意了爱护社内的公共财产。
    黄庄乡党支部书记对记者说：今年我们乡的三个农业社种植的农作物全面获得丰收，90％的社员增加了收入，这些成绩的取得，先进人物起了很大的作用。麦收期间阴雨连绵，红星社第四生产队王车超及时提出“抢收、抢晒、抢打”的建议，使全队三百多亩麦子避免了霉烂的损失。光明社傅树起过去不注意爱护公共财产，经过教育后，每逢阴天下雨，不管白天黑夜都能积极检查、放好各种农具。这个社的饲养员傅延义开始时工作不负责任，他喂的猪都很瘦弱，有的死了也不管，经过教育后也转变了。如在今年2月间一个寒冷的夜晚，他怕刚刚生下的几头小猪冻死，就把这些小猪抱在炕上，把自己唯一的棉袄给小猪盖上，自己却冻的睡不着觉。　（新华社）
    和平社根据社员意见奖励工作较好的小队长
    江苏省太仓县和平农业社的五十名生产小队长中，有二十三名分别受到了补贴五个到十五个劳动日的奖励。社员们认为，这些生产小队长工作负责，因公少做了一些劳动日，应该给以补贴。
    受到补贴的曹惠村，一贯表现很好，工作处处带头。如在秋收的时候，他清早起来收拾场地，等候社员来掼稻。晚上人散了，他总要掌着油灯仔细地扫净场上的稻谷，每次扫起好几斤。又如屠金林，他负责的那个生产小队，是全社在爱护农具、农船和耕畜方面做得最好的一个队。由于屠金林以身作则，社员对公共财物都像对自己家里的东西一样爱惜。龚宝兴、屠根林等四户社员生活困难，屠金林马上到社里和干部商量，借了二十元给他们，提高了他们的生产积极性。大家都说，生产小队生产有成绩，和小队长的领导分不开。　（新华社）
    恩施专区八个县奖励受农民爱戴的干部
    湖北省恩施专区八个县最近表扬和奖励了一批深受农民爱戴的干部。宣恩县评选出的模范农业社主任和区乡干部积极工作者有三百三十多人。建始县除了评选出大批模范干部以外，还评选出了一个模范乡。
    受到表扬和奖励的干部中，宣恩县三区干部认真总结并且因地制宜地推广了马虎坪乡蓄旱秧的经验，使全区今年试种的几百亩双季稻获得增产。中共巴东县岔二乡支部书记谭儒佳依靠群众，坚持推广先进技术，终于在偏僻的高山上创造了亩产千斤稻、万斤薯的高额丰产纪录。
    关心群众生活，坚持勤俭办社方针，是这些被奖励的干部们的共同特点。中共建始县大里乡支部书记黄山德，经过深入访问老农找出多年不知道的老煤洞以后，解决了乡里的缺肥困难。他还帮助高潮农业社十一户困难户安排活路，现在已有九户变成了余粮户。咸丰县梅子坪乡水红农业社主任杨再善，他访问了一百二十户社员，发现有五十五户社员无钱买猪，于是通过社委会讨论把社里几十头小猪赊给社员喂养，社员们个个满意。
