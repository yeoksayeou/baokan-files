Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 23rd. Czechoslovakia will build a giant atomic power station. Its generating capacity will be 150,000 kilowatts, much larger than any similar power station currently in the world. As everyone knows, the Soviet Union already has an atomic power station for industrial use that has been generating electricity for more than two years, with a generating capacity of 5,000 kilowatts, and the Soviet Union plans to build an atomic power station with a generating capacity of 400,000 kilowatts by 1960. The atomic power station for scientific use recently put into production in the United Kingdom has a capacity of 48,000 kilowatts.

    The Czechoslovakian "People's Defence Daily" pointed out in its report on the 22nd that this power station will be built in the Slovak region. Preparations for the construction project will begin next year, construction will begin in 1958, and the first batch of electricity can be generated by 1961. All the equipment for the power station will be manufactured by Czechoslovakia itself, and the Soviet Union will supply Czechoslovakia with Uranium-235 as fuel.

    捷将建巨型原子能电力站
    新华社布拉格23日电　捷克斯洛伐克将建立一座巨型原子能电力站。它的发电能力是十五万瓩，比世界上现有的同类电力站大得多。大家知道，苏联已经发电两年多的供工业用的原子能电力站的发电能力是五千瓩，苏联准备在1960年建成的原子能电力站发电能力为四十万瓩。英国不久前投入生产的供科学用的原子能电力站是四万八千瓩。
    捷克斯洛伐克“人民防线报”22日在报道这一消息时指出，这个电力站将建立在斯洛伐克地区。建筑工程的准备工作将从明年开始，1958年动工兴建，到1961年就可以发出第一批电力。电力站的全部装备将由捷克斯洛伐克自己制造，苏联将供给捷克斯洛伐克铀二三五作为燃料。
