Xinhua News Agency, Wuhu, December 3rd (Xinhua News Agency reporter Tang Tianzhen): Wuhu City's local industrial factories have strengthened their work to improve product quality. Among the city's twenty-eight important products, twenty-one have reached or basically reached the quality standards stipulated by the state, and six have reached the quality standards stipulated by the province and city. The leather shoes made by the Wuhu Overseas Chinese Shoe Factory, which were originally heavily stockpiled due to poor quality, are now in short supply. The printed bed sheets produced by the Wuhu Printing and Dyeing Factory have caught up with the quality of the nationally renowned Shanghai Pacific bed sheets. The monthly output has increased from more than 14,000 to more than 40,000, and the sales market has expanded to Beijing and the Northeast.

The quality of Wuhu City's local industrial products was originally very poor. For example, the cotton knot impurities in the cotton yarn of the Wuhu Textile Factory in January this year reached as high as 150, which is almost double the state-prescribed standard. Consumers criticized the Lehua brand cigarettes produced by the Wuhu Xinzhong Cigarette Factory as "black dog droppings," saying that this kind of cigarette is "so hard it could kill a dog, and so loose you can only take one puff." Due to the poor quality of the products, many products were slow-moving. In response to this situation, the Wuhu Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened several industrial conferences this year, deeply examining and criticizing the ideological bias of production leaders in neglecting quality. Each factory chose the most advanced factory in the country with the same industry and nature as its benchmark, and also formulated quality standards according to different circumstances for some products that did not have national standards. Leading cadres worked hard to change their leadership style and actively sought and solved key problems hindering product quality improvement together with the workers. Chen Wensheng, the director of the Wuhu Oil Press Factory, in order to solve the problem of poor oil extraction quality, led a group of technicians to visit and study oil factories in Qingdao and Shanghai, absorbed the experience of other factories, and made the refined peanut oil reach the standard of export-grade first-class products.

The actions of leading cadres in caring about and attaching importance to product quality greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the workers. Since the beginning of this year, the workers have put forward a large number of rationalization proposals and promoted a variety of advanced experiences to ensure quality.

    积极学习同类企业的先进经验，决心向优良产品看齐
    芜湖地方工业品由滞销变为畅销
    据新华社芜湖3日电　新华社记者汤天真报道：芜湖市地方工业各厂加强改进产品质量工作，在全市二十八种重要产品当中，有二十一种已经达到或基本上达到国家规定的质量指标，有六种达到了省、市规定的质量指标。原来因为质量不好而大批积压的芜湖华侨制鞋厂做的皮鞋，现在已经供不应求。芜湖印染厂的印花被单，由于赶上了全国名牌货上海太平洋被单的质量，每月的产品已经由一万四千多条增加到四万多条，销售市场扩大到北京和东北等地。
    芜湖市地方工业产品质量原来很不好。如芜湖纺织厂今年1月份棉纱的棉结杂质高达一百五十粒，比国家规定的指标超出将近一倍；消费者批评芜湖新中烟厂出的乐华牌烟是“黑狗屎”，说这种烟“硬的打死狗，松的吸一口”。由于产品质量低劣，许多产品滞销。针对这种情况，中共芜湖市委今年先后召开了多次工业会议，深刻地检查和批判了生产领导干部中忽视质量的思想偏向。各工厂都选择全国同产业同性质的最先进的工厂作为自己看齐的对象，对某些没有国家指标的产品，也都根据不同情况分别制定了质量指标。领导干部努力转变领导作风，同职工群众一起积极寻找和解决妨碍产品质量提高的关键问题。芜湖榨油厂厂长陈文胜为了解决出油质量低劣的问题，带领一批技术工人到青岛和上海等地油厂去参观学习，吸收了其他厂的经验，使炼出的花生油达到了出口的一级品的标准。
    领导干部的关心和重视产品质量的行动，大大鼓舞了职工群众的积极性。今年以来，职工们提出了大批的合理化建议，推广了多种保证质量的先进经验。
