Tales of Enlistment Widely Spread

She finally made up her mind!

The winter nights in Beihai are a bit chilly. But you can still occasionally see groups of three or five tourists and pairs of lovers.

On a chair by the sea sat a young couple. They sometimes talked and laughed, and sometimes remained silent. After about two hours, they reluctantly parted, both with happy smiles on their faces.

The girl returned home, immediately found a piece of paper, and sat down to write:

"To the respected comrades of the Beijing Military Service Bureau: Can you quickly answer my questions? I have a fiancé named Xie Wensheng, who just turned eighteen and is a traffic policeman. He has an invincible heart – he wants to enlist in active service! Last year, he was not approved because he was not old enough, and he even shed tears because of it. Now that he has the opportunity this year, how happy he is! He and I went to the hospital for a physical examination, and the doctor said he was fine. We were so happy that we jumped up at the time.

"He told me about his military service as early as June this year, and also explained a lot of reasons to me. Now, I fully support his patriotic action. Originally, we planned to get married in 1958; but for the sake of the country, we can completely put it aside!"

The signatory is Li Yuqing, a lively and stubborn girl studying at Beijing No. 53 Middle School. When Xie Wensheng first told her about his idea of joining the army, she replied without hesitation: "Okay, go ahead!" But after a while, she wavered again. She thought: "If Wensheng leaves, I'll be alone..."

"Wensheng, don't go!" she suddenly proposed one time.

"Why?"

She lowered her head, her face flushing, and remained silent.

There is a tram ticket seller in Beijing named Yan Fukun. When the state recruited new soldiers last year, his fiancée Xi Yunhua encouraged him to join the army. Before parting, Xi Yunhua also specially gave him a pair of pillows as a souvenir, with the words "Defending the Motherland, a Sacred Duty!" embroidered on the pillows. Xie Wensheng repeatedly told this story to Li Yuqing. He also told her: Many of my junior high school classmates have joined the army, and their lives in the army are very good and they are making rapid progress. If everyone is reluctant to leave, who will defend socialist construction...?

Once, twice, three times, Li Yuqing repeatedly thought: "Wensheng is right, if he can't join the army because of me, who would I be worthy of?" She finally made up her mind!

After the letter was sent to the military service bureau, she called several times to inquire whether Wensheng had been approved. On December 4, she received the news of his approval, and immediately wrote a letter to Wensheng to tell him the good news, and expressed her determination: I will wait for you forever!

Uncle Atang's Busyness

One night in mid-October, Zhong Atang, an old man in his fifties from Luomen Township, Putuo County, Zhejiang Province, returned from a mass meeting in the constituency on "recruiting soldiers." When his wife saw his excited appearance, she was about to ask, when he blurted out his plan to send his second son, Deyu, to join the army. Deyu's mother thought: The second child is just eighteen this year, which is the age for conscription, but the marriage has not been arranged yet, how can I bear to let him leave all of a sudden! But when she recalled the situation before and after liberation, she quickly changed her mind and agreed with her husband's idea.

Zhong Deyu fishes at the Luomen Fisheries Cooperative. One day, he returned home from ocean fishing. As soon as he stepped into the house, Uncle Atang said to him head-on: "Deyu, your good opportunity has come. Your mother and I have discussed it and plan to send you to serve in the military and defend the motherland... You don't have to worry about anything at home!" Deyu's mother interjected, "I'm not worried about anything else, I'm just afraid Deyu's health won't pass the examination." Deyu blinked his eyes non-stop, looking at his father and then at his mother, he was really overjoyed and didn't know how to answer. He just secretly made up his mind: I must strive to perform meritorious service in the position of defending the motherland!

In the days before Deyu went to the county for a physical examination, Uncle Atang and his wife seemed particularly busy. On October 22, Uncle Atang got up at the fourth watch and went to Dazhan Street, ten miles away, to buy pig trotters and dates to nourish Deyu's body; Deyu's mother was also busy making new clothes and washing and mending quilts for her son, so that the child could leave his hometown comfortably.

Uncle Atang and his wife finally sent off their son with happy and reluctant feelings. Deyu was approved, and on November 7, he put on a new cotton military uniform and began a happy and tense collective life.

After Approval

After Zhao Liming knew that he had been approved, he was happy in his heart, and said to everyone he met: My wish has been fulfilled, and it's time for me to guard the gate of the motherland this time!

This young man lives in Sanguanmiao Township, Xinyang, Henan, and is an accountant at the Sulou Agricultural Cooperative. Serving in active service has been his ideal for a long time. In order to strive for active service, he usually pays attention to protecting his health, not drinking cold water, not bathing in ponds, and not sleeping outside. Whenever he had the opportunity, he would also explain the principles of military service to his family, and the whole family agreed to let him join the army.

Now, Zhao Liming is about to say goodbye to his hometown. He spent three days and three nights calculating the accounts of the cooperative clearly and preparing to hand them over. In addition, he also told others about his experience and methods of being an accountant. He also said to his family: "After I leave, don't bother the cooperative because of trivial matters, you should produce well and take the lead in responding to the government's call!"

When the whole family saw that Liming was about to leave them, they felt both happy and sad. His mother exhorted: "You must work hard and study hard when you go to the army." His wife told him a lot of heartfelt words, and proposed: "We are both members of the Communist Youth League, and we should both study and work hard, and see who can join the Party first!" His brother also said: "Don't worry about the family after you go to the army, listen to your superiors and unite well with your comrades."

    应征佳话到处传
    她终于下定了决心！
    北海的冬天夜晚，寒气有些逼人。但还可以不时看到三五成群的游人和对对的情侣。
    海边的一张椅子上，坐着一对青年男女。他们时而谈笑风生，时而又沉默不语。约摸过了两个钟头的样子，他们才恋恋不舍地分了手，脸上都浮现着愉快的笑容。
    女的回到家里，立刻找出了一张纸，静坐书写：
    “北京市兵役局敬爱的负责同志：你们能很快地回答我的问题吗？我有一个未婚夫，叫谢文生，刚满十八岁，是交通警察。他有一颗不可战胜的心——要求应征服现役！去年因为年龄不够，没被批准，因此他还掉过眼泪。今年有了机会，他是多么高兴呀！他和我曾到医院里检查了身体，大夫说他一切都好，当时我们都喜欢得跳了起来。
    “关于服兵役的事，今年6月份他就告诉了我，还给我讲了很多道理。现在，我完全支持他这种爱国行动。本来，我们准备1958年结婚；但为了国家的事，我们完全可以把它暂放在一旁！”
    署名的叫李玉清，是一个性情活泼而倔强的姑娘，在北京市五十三中念书。当谢文生第一次把他要参军的想法告诉她时，她毫不犹豫地答复：“好，你去吧！”但过了些时，她却又动摇了。她想：“要是文生走了，只剩自己……”
    “文生，你不要去了！”一次，她突然提出。
    “为什么？”
    她低下了头，脸上腓红，沉默着。
    北京市有个电车售票员，叫延福坤。去年国家征集新兵时，他的未婚妻席云华曾鼓励他参军。临别时，席云华还特意送给他一对枕头留念，枕头上绣着：“保卫祖国，神圣职责！”谢文生把这个故事，反复讲给李玉清听。还告诉她：我初中时候的同学很多都参军了，他们在部队的生活都很好，进步也快，若大家都依依不舍，社会主义建设由谁保卫……。
    一次，两次，三次，李玉清反复思索着：“文生说得很对，假若因为我，他不能参军，我对得起谁。”她，终于下定了决心！
    信寄到兵役局后，她曾好几次打电话询问，打听文生是否已被批准。12月4日，她得到了被批准的消息，立刻给文生写信报喜，并表示自己的决心：永远等着你！

    阿棠伯的忙碌
    10月中旬的一个晚上，浙江省普陀县螺门乡五十开外的锺阿棠老伯，从选区里开了“征集兵员”的群众大会回来，老伴看到他兴奋的样子，刚想开口问，他就把想送二儿子德裕去参军的打算吐露出来。德裕娘想：老二今年正好十八岁，倒够上应征的年龄，就是婚事还没有办，一下子离开怎能舍得！但当她回顾到解放前后的情景，很快又转变了念头，同意了丈夫的主张。
    锺德裕在螺门渔业社捕鱼，一天，他从海洋捕鱼回来，刚踏进家门，阿棠伯劈头就对他说：“德裕，你的好机会到了，我和你娘已商量妥当，打算送你去服兵役，保卫祖国……，家里一切事情你也不必担心！”德裕娘插上说：“别的倒不担心，只怕德裕身体验不上。”德裕两眼不停地眨着，看看爹爹，又望望娘，真是喜出望外，不知怎样回答才好。只是暗暗地下着决心：要在保卫祖国的岗位上争取立功！
    当德裕要到县里去检查身体的前几天，阿棠伯老两口显得格外忙碌。10月22日那天，阿棠伯四更就起了床，特地到来回十里路远的大展街，买来猪蹄和枣子等给德裕补养身体；德裕娘也忙着给儿子做新衣服、洗补被子，好叫孩子舒舒服服离开家乡。
    阿棠伯老两口终于以高兴和难舍的心情送走了自己的儿子。德裕被批准了，并在11月7日换上了新的棉军装，开始了愉快而紧张的集体生活。　（翁来德、归兆铭）
    批准以后
    赵立明知道自己被批准了以后，心里乐滋滋的，逢人就说：我的愿望实现了，这次可该我去保卫祖国的大门了！
    这个小伙子家住河南信阳三官庙乡，是苏楼农业社的会计。服现役，是他很早的理想了。为了争取服现役，平常他很注意保重身体，做到不喝冷水，不在塘里洗澡，不在外面睡觉。一有机会，他还把服兵役的道理讲给家里的人听，全家人都同意他去参军。
    现在，赵立明就要和家乡分别了。他用了三天三夜的时间，把社里的账目算得一清二楚，准备移交。另外，还把自己做会计的经验和方法，告诉了别人。他又对家里的人说：“我走后，不要因为一点小事就找社里麻烦，应该好好生产，带头响应政府的号召！”
    全家人看到立明快要和他们分别了，心里又喜欢，又难受。母亲叮嘱道：“你到部队去要好好工作，好好学习。”妻子对他说了很多知心话，并提出：“咱俩都是青年团员，都应当好好学习和劳动，将来看谁能先入党！”他的哥哥也说：“到部队后别操家里的心，听上级的话，和同志们团结好。”
              （刘慰民、丘道富）（附图片）
    现在，谢文生已经穿上了军装，不久就要和李玉清分别了。看，他们是那么兴奋、愉快，但又多么恋恋不舍呀！
