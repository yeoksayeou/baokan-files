    Six Provincial and Municipal Party Committees Hold Plenary Sessions to Deploy Work According to the Spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee

    (Our Newspaper News) In late November, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party successively held plenary sessions or enlarged meetings to implement the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and deploy work for 1957 and the present.

    The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee meeting believes that in carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, it is necessary to strengthen ideological leadership, accept past experiences, and prevent the deviations of a "gust of wind" and a "蜂拥而上" (fēng yōng ér shàng - "swarming up," indicating a rushed, disorganized approach).

    These meetings all earnestly discussed the issue of carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy in industrial and agricultural production. The meetings of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Beijing Municipal Party Committee both pointed out that in carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, it is necessary to pay attention to preventing the tendency of only seeking quantity and neglecting quality, and of cutting corners under the pretext of reducing costs. The Beijing Municipal Party Committee's plenary (enlarged) meeting also pointed out that doing a good job in the campaign to increase production and practice economy lies in relying on the masses and strengthening the democratic management of industrial and mining enterprises. Necessary organizational measures should be taken, such as convening representative conferences of factories and enterprises, to implement the mass line in enterprise leadership. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee's plenary (enlarged) meeting decided to carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy in a prepared and step-by-step manner. Before February of next year, the whole province will conduct extensive and in-depth ideological education on increasing production and practicing economy, and after February, the campaign to increase production and practice economy will be carried out comprehensively. The meeting believes that in carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, it is necessary to accept past experiences and lessons, and prevent the deviations of a "gust of wind" and a "蜂拥而上" ignoring ideological leadership. The movement should be gradually unfolded on the basis of conducting special investigations and studies, typical experiments, and formulating specific measures. When criticizing and exposing extravagant and wasteful phenomena, it is necessary to patiently conduct persuasion and education, pointing out how to correct them, so that the movement can develop healthily. The meeting requested that in the movement, not only should extravagant and wasteful phenomena be criticized, but also diligent and thrifty units and individuals should be vigorously commended.

    The issue of agricultural production increase was also an important topic of these provincial and municipal party committee meetings. The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee meeting determined that in the rural areas of the province, a campaign to increase production and practice economy, focusing on increasing grain and cotton production and comprehensively developing the rural economy, should be launched, requiring that next year's cotton and grain output exceed the state target for 1957. This winter, preparations for increasing production such as accumulating fertilizer and protecting livestock should be done well, and at the same time, the planning and agricultural technical guidance work should be improved. Agricultural cooperatives should adhere to the policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and strive to save grain. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee meeting believes that the main key to increasing agricultural production in the future is to rationally adjust the layout of crop planting and reform the agricultural production system, first of all, to vigorously develop rice and increase the yield per unit area, so that the total output of various crops such as grain, cotton, and oilseeds will greatly exceed this year's level. The meeting also discussed the issue of changing the impoverished face of the Xuzhou and Huaihe areas in three to five years. This area accounts for 43% of the province's cultivated land area, but due to frequent floods and droughts, the output of crops is very low (accounting for only 21% of the province's total crop output). The meeting requested that, on the premise of solving major floods, the masses should be widely mobilized to vigorously build large and small-scale farmland water conservancy projects; in the next three years, the sown area of rice, cotton, oilseeds, and miscellaneous grains should be continuously expanded, and a large number of sideline production such as breeding should be carried out, so that the annual agricultural and sideline income of farmers in the area will gradually reach about 60 to 70 yuan per person per year. The Hebei Provincial Party Committee meeting believes that the province's agricultural cooperatives should carry out a rectification with greater strength. The meeting determined that the rectification of the cooperatives should start from production, be closely combined with the work of rectifying the Party, and further strengthen the core role of the Party's grassroots organizations in rural areas among the masses of farmers. The meeting especially pointed out that the rectification of the seven thousand joint-village large-scale cooperatives, which account for more than 60% of the province's total households, should be very cautious. Experience has proven that one village and one cooperative is better, but whether the joint-village cooperatives should be separated should be based on promoting unity and production, and different specific situations should be handled differently.

    Comrade Tao Zhu criticized the extravagance and waste of the responsible cadres of the Guangdong Provincial-level organs and made self-criticism, and decided to use the "six nots" method to oppose waste and practice strict economy.

    The plenary or enlarged meetings of these provincial and municipal party committees all required that strict streamlining and economy be implemented in Party and state organs.

    The enlarged meeting of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made a resolution, requiring that the secretaries take the lead and the provincial-level organs take the lead in implementing streamlining and economy throughout the province and reforming the work style of cadres. The meeting resolved that: first of all, vigorously streamline the establishment of provincial-level Party and government organs, with the average number of people in the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Provincial People's Committee, and their directly affiliated organs reduced by 30%; the number of people in the municipal-level Party and government organs in Guangzhou reduced by 20%; and the establishment of other special zones, counties, and district organs should also be appropriately streamlined. The work of streamlining the organs will begin in December and end by the end of June next year. The surplus cadres will be properly arranged. Comrade Tao Zhu, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, pointed out in his concluding remarks at the meeting that the internal levels of the Guangdong provincial-level organs are currently too many, and the establishment is bloated. There is also a phenomenon of overstaffing in the organs below the provincial level. Comrade Tao Zhu specifically criticized the extravagance and waste of responsible cadres of provincial-level organs, such as living in houses that are too spacious, using too many cars, and entertaining too many guests, and made self-criticism. The meeting unanimously agreed to immediately implement the "six nots" among all organs and all cadres, especially provincial-level organs and responsible cadres: one, no increase in establishment (referring to after streamlining); two, no building of houses (houses that are not enough will be reasonably adjusted); three, no buying of cars (except for buses and transport trucks); four, no entertaining (except for international friends); five, no giving gifts; six, no holding of cabaret-style parties and non-mass dance parties. The meeting decided to adopt the method of rectification, first checking the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, in order to drive the whole province. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee meeting also criticized the phenomenon of large institutions and enterprises, overstaffing, and the atmosphere of extravagance and waste, showing off, and talking about generosity in some organs and enterprises. It called for the implementation of the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, advocating the work style of hard work and simplicity, going deep into reality, and going deep into the masses. The meetings of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, and the Beijing Municipal Party Committee also discussed the issue of streamlining institutions and improving work style. It was decided to reduce levels and streamline institutions, and to transfer strong cadres to enrich the lower levels or to help the grassroots work for a long time.

    Some meetings also discussed the issues of saving grain, urban supply, and strengthening current affairs education for the masses. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee meeting also reviewed the implementation of this year's national economic development plan in the province.

    六个省市委举行全体会议
    根据二中全会精神部署工作
    本报讯　11月下旬，中共北京市委员会、中共广东省委员会、中共河北省委员会、中共山西省委员会、中共江苏省委员会、中共江西省委员会，先后举行全体会议或扩大会议，贯彻中央八届二中全会精神，部署1957年和当前工作。
    江苏省委会议认为开展增产节约运动，要加强思想领导，接受过去经验，防止一阵风和一窝蜂的偏差。
    这些会议都认真地讨论了开展工农业生产的增产节约运动问题。中共山西省委和北京市委的会议都指出，开展增产节约运动必须注意防止只图数量、忽视质量和借口降低成本而实行偷工减料的倾向。北京市委全体会议（扩大）还指出：搞好增产节约运动，在于依靠群众、加强工矿企业的民主管理。应当采取必要的组织措施，例如召开工厂企业的代表大会等来贯彻企业领导的群众路线。江苏省委全体会议（扩大）决定，要有准备有步骤地开展增产节约运动，全省在明年2月份以前，进行广泛而深入的增产节约的思想教育，2月份以后，全面开展增产节约运动。会议认为：开展增产节约运动，必须接受过去的经验教训，防止一阵风、一窝蜂忽视思想领导的偏差。要在进行专题调查研究和典型试验、拟订具体措施的基础上，逐步展开运动。在批评和揭发铺张浪费现象的时候，必须耐心地进行说服教育，指出如何改正，使运动健康地开展。会议要求，在运动中不仅要批评铺张浪费现象，还要大力表扬勤俭朴素的单位和个人。
    农业增产问题，也是这些省、市委会议的一项重要内容。山西省委会议确定，在全省农村中，要开展以增产粮棉为主、全面发展农村经济的增产节约运动要求明年的棉粮产量超过1957年的国家指标。今年冬季要做好积肥、保护牲畜等增产准备工作，同时改进计划编制和农业技术指导工作。农业社要坚持勤俭办社方针，力求节约粮食。江苏省委会议认为，今后农业增产的主要关键，是合理调整农作物种植的布局和改革农业生产制度，首先是大力发展水稻、提高单位面积产量，使粮、棉、油料等各种作物的总产量大大超过今年的水平。会议还讨论了要在三、五年内改变徐、淮地区的贫苦面貌的问题。这个地区占全省耕地面积43％。但由于经常遭受涝旱灾害，农作物产量很低（仅占全省农作物总产量21％）。会议要求，在解决特大洪水的前提下，广泛动员群众大力兴修大小型农田水利工程；在今后三年内继续扩大水稻、棉花、油料和杂粮的播种面积，大量开展饲养等副业生产，使该地区农民的全年农副业纯收入逐步达到每年每人六、七十元左右。河北省委会议认为，全省农业社应以较大的力量进行一次整顿。会议确定，整社应从生产入手，同整党工作密切结合进行，进一步加强农村党的基层组织在农民群众中的核心作用。会议特别指出，对占全省总农户60％以上的七千个联村大型社的整顿要十分慎重。经验证明一村一社是较好的，但是，联村社是否分开，要从有利于团结生产出发，不同的具体情况要有不同的处理办法。
    陶铸同志针对广东省省级机关负责干部的铺张浪费现象作了批评和自我批评，并且决定用“六不”的办法，反对浪费，厉行节约。
    这些省市委的全体或扩大会议，都要求在党和国家机关中厉行精简节约。
    中共广东省委员会扩大会议作出决议，要求由书记动手、省级机关带头，在全省范围内厉行精简节约，革新干部作风。会议决议：首先大力精简省级党、政机关编制，中共广东省委员会、省人民委员会及其直属各机关人数平均缩减30％；广州市市级党、政机关人数缩减20％；其他专区、县、区机关编制也要适当精简。机关精简工作从12月开始进行，到明年6月底结束。编余干部将进行妥善安排。省委书记陶铸同志在会上做总结发言时指出，广东省省级机关目前内部层次太多，编制臃肿。省以下的机关也有人浮于事的现象。陶铸同志特别针对着省级机关负责干部住房子太宽、用汽车太多、请客太多等铺张浪费现象，进行了批评与自我批评。会议一致同意在全体机关和全体干部中，尤其是省级机关和负责干部中，立刻实行“六不”：一不增加编制（指精简后）；二不盖房子（房子不够合理调整）；三不买一辆汽车（公共汽车和运输货车例外）；四不请客（国际友人例外）；五不送礼；六不举行堂会式的晚会和非群众性的舞会。会议决定采用整风的方法，首先检查省委领导，以带动全省。江西省委的会议也批判了某些机关和企业机构庞大、人浮于事的现象，和铺张浪费、好排场、讲阔气的风气。要求贯彻八届二中全会精神，提倡艰苦朴素深入实际深入群众的作风。山西省委、河北省委、北京市委的会议，也都讨论了精简机构改进作风的问题。决定要减少层次精简机构，抽调强有力的干部充实下层，或长期帮助基层工作。
    有些会议还分别讨论了节约粮食、城市供应、加强对群众的时事教育等问题。江西省委会议，还检查了今年全省国民经济发展计划的执行情况。
