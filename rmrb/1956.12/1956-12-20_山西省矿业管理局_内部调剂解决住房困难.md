    Shanxi Provincial Mining Bureau
    Internal Adjustment to Solve Housing Difficulties
    (Our report) The Shanxi Provincial Mining Bureau, under the leadership of leading cadres, promoted the spirit of hard work and frugality, and rationally adjusted the original dormitory housing, solving the housing problems of fifteen employee families. Originally, the housing situation in this bureau had unreasonable phenomena. For example, some section chiefs or division chiefs, who had relatively small families, were mechanically assigned houses according to the rank of cadres. As a result, some people lived in relatively spacious conditions, while others had to live in hotels for a long time because there was no room in the bureau. In November, when the leading cadres of this bureau learned about this situation, they first convened an enlarged meeting of the general party branch of the bureau, specially studying and discussing this issue, and designated Liu Zihua, director of the bureau's office, to form a housing adjustment team to conduct investigation and research. With the leading cadres taking the lead in tightening up housing and the cooperation of all staff, the housing problems of all staff in the bureau were solved. For example, Bureau Director Cheng Lifu, Division Chief Zhang Fuzhu and others took the initiative to vacate one to two rooms, which not only saves the state more than 3,000 yuan in rent expenses each year, but also benefits the overly crowded hotels in Taiyuan.

    内部调剂解决住房困难
    本报讯　山西省矿业管理局，在领导干部带动之下，发扬艰苦朴素的精神，把原有的宿舍住房，加以合理调整，解决了十五家职工的住房问题。原来这个局的住房情况，存在着不合理的现象。如有的处长或科长，本来人口比较少，但也机械地按着干部的级别来分配房子，结果，有的人住处就比较宽裕，有的人则因局里没屋住，就只得长期寄居在旅馆里。11月间，当这个局的领导干部了解到这一情况时，首先召开了机关党总支扩大会议，专门研究和讨论了这一问题，并指定局办公室主任刘子华为首组成调整住房小组，进行调查研究。在领导干部带头紧缩住房和全体工作人员的合作之下，解决了全局工作人员的住房问题。如局长程力夫，处长张福柱等人，都主动地腾出了一至二间房子，这不但每年可给国家节约三千多元的房租开支，而且对于过份拥挤的太原市的旅馆也有好处。
