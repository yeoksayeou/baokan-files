    Xiaoguan River Iron Factory Indiscriminately Fells Trees
    The Xiaoguan River Iron Factory (including the Chahe Branch Factory) in Huili County, Sichuan Province, has been using charcoal as fuel for iron smelting and pot casting since 1951, wasting large quantities of construction timber.
    Initially, the Huili County government, based on the application from the Xiaoguan River Iron Factory, allocated more than five mu of forest area to the factory for logging and utilization in order to take care of their production. However, it was stipulated that only crooked and twisted trees could be felled, construction timber should be preserved during logging, and new forests should be cultivated. But the factory did not implement this regulation. Under the pretext of "reducing costs," it disregarded the loss of national resources and indiscriminately felled trees nearby for charcoal burning. Now, the forest area within thirty to forty li around the factory has been burned out, with only some crooked and twisted saplings remaining. According to a survey by the county People's Committee Logging Inspection Team in August of this year, mature timber accounted for about 90% of the factory's felling over the years.
    In addition, the factory also adopted methods such as scattered purchases, which caused chaotic phenomena such as the masses stealing state-owned timber and indiscriminately felling private forests.
    In 1954, an inspection team composed of units such as the Central Ministry of Forestry inspected these situations and suggested that the Xiaoguan River Iron Factory use coal instead of charcoal. Moreover, Huili produces coal, and procurement is not difficult. However, the factory refused to adopt this suggestion under various pretexts.
    In order to protect existing forests and support national construction, it is hoped that the Xiaoguan River Iron Factory will immediately stop the act of indiscriminate felling of forests, and it is hoped that relevant units will supervise it.　Yang Weiye

### 小关河铁厂乱砍林木

    小关河铁厂乱砍林木
    四川省会理县小关河铁厂（包括岔河分厂），1951年以来，一直采用木炭作为炼铁、铸锅的燃料，大量浪费着建筑木材。
    最初，会理县政府机关根据小关河铁厂的申请，为了照顾他们的生产，拨了五亩以上的林区给该厂采伐利用，但规定只准砍弯扭木，在采伐中要保留建筑用材，并要求培育新林。但该厂并不执行这个规定，借口“降低成本”，不顾国家资源的损失，一概就近采伐烧炭。现在，该厂周围三四十里路的林区都被烧光了，残存的仅是一些弯扭不成材的幼树。据今年8月县人民委员会伐木检查组的调查，该厂历年来的砍伐中，成林材占90％左右。
    另外，该厂还采用零星收购等办法，引起群众盗伐国家林木和对私有林进行乱砍乱伐的混乱现象。
    1954年，中央林业部等单位组成的检查组曾检查了这些情况，建议小关河铁厂用煤来代替木炭，而且会理又产煤，采购并不困难，该厂却借故推诿，拒不采纳。
    为了保护现有森林，支援国家建设，希望小关河铁厂立即停止乱砍森林的行为，并希望有关单位加以督促。　杨伟叶
