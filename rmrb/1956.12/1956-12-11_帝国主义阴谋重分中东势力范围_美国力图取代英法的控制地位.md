Xinhua News Agency, December 10th: TASS Moscow, December 8th: "Izvestia" correspondents in New York, Karev and Matveyev, reported on the conspiracies of the colonialists against the Arab countries. They pointed out that recently, there has been a re-allocation of roles within the Western diplomatic camp. Two months ago, London and Paris wanted to take the lead in forcing Egypt to accept a solution to the Suez problem that suited Western countries. Now they are forced to retreat and hand over the leading role in implementing this policy to the United States.

It has been reported that there is a large-scale transaction plan between the United States and Britain, which the British Foreign Secretary brought back to London from Washington. This transaction is becoming more and more concrete as time goes by. American imperialism is eager to replace the British and French colonialists in the Arab East. American newspapers and Washington officials have repeatedly claimed that the Soviet Union wants to fill the "vacuum" of power in the Arab East, actually to cover up the economic, military, and political expansion of American monopoly capital in this region.

The "Izvestia" reporters pointed out that, according to recent materials published by the United States, about 60% of the oil currently extracted in the Middle East belongs to American oil monopoly capital, while the share of their British and French partners is about 40%. The profits of domestic oil companies in the United States do not exceed 15% to 20% of the invested capital, while the profits of these companies in the Middle East are equivalent to 100% or even 200%.

Karev and Matveyev recounted that recently, the U.S. government has become more supportive of the Baghdad Pact and intends to increase the supply of weapons to its member states. The State Department is studying the issue of transporting aircraft, tanks, and other heavy weapons to Iraq.

    帝国主义阴谋重分中东势力范围
    美国力图取代英法的控制地位
    据新华社10日讯　塔斯社莫斯科8日讯：“消息报”驻纽约记者卡列夫和马特维耶夫报道了殖民主义者们针对阿拉伯国家所进行的阴谋活动。他们指出，最近在西方外交阵营中，角色重新作了一次分配。两个月以前，伦敦和巴黎想在强迫埃及接受一项适合西方国家心意的苏伊士问题解决办法的时候充当领头人。现在它们被迫退到后面，把执行这一政策的领导角色让给美国了。
    已经有消息说，美国和英国之间有一项大规模的交易计划，英国外交大臣从华盛顿回到伦敦的时候就带有这样一个计划。这笔交易随着时间的消逝而越来越具体化了。美帝国主义迫切希望在阿拉伯东方取英法殖民主义者的地位而代之。美国报纸和华盛顿官员们一再扬言说苏联想填充阿拉伯东方的力量“真空地带”，实际是掩盖美国垄断资本在这一地区的经济、军事和政治上的扩张。
    “消息报”记者指出，根据美国最近发表的材料，现在在中东开采的石油大约有60％是归美国石油垄断资本的，而他们的英国伙伴和法国伙伴的份额是40％左右。美国国内的石油公司的利润不超过所投资本的15％到20％，而这些公司在中东的利润则相当于100％，甚至200％。
    卡列夫和马特维耶夫追述说，最近，美国政府更加支持巴格达条约，并且打算增加运交给条约成员国的武器。国务院正在研究运送飞机、坦克和其他重武器给伊拉克的问题。
