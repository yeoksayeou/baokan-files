In April 1956, we discussed the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat in relation to the Stalin issue. Since then, a series of events have occurred in the international communist movement that have drawn the attention of the Chinese people. The speech by Comrade Tito on November 11 and the comments by various communist parties on this speech, after being published in our newspapers, have once again raised many questions that need to be answered. In this article, we will focus on the following issues: first, the assessment of the basic path of the Soviet revolution and construction; second, the assessment of Stalin's merits and demerits; third, the opposition to dogmatism and revisionism; fourth, the international unity of the proletariat.

When observing modern international issues, we must start from the most fundamental fact: the opposition between the imperialist aggression bloc and the forces of the people of the world. The Chinese people, who have suffered from imperialist aggression, will never forget that imperialism has always opposed the liberation of the peoples of various countries and the independence of all oppressed nations, and has always regarded the communist movement, which most resolutely represents the interests of the people, as a thorn in its side. Since the birth of the first socialist country, the Soviet Union, imperialism has used every means to harm it. After the establishment of a series of socialist countries, the opposition between the imperialist camp and the socialist camp, and the blatant sabotage activities of the imperialist camp against the socialist camp, have become a particularly prominent phenomenon in world politics. The head of the imperialist camp, the United States, has been particularly vicious and shameless in interfering in the internal affairs of socialist countries. It has long obstructed our liberation of the territory of Taiwan and has long openly pursued the policy of overthrowing the governments of Eastern European countries.

Imperialism's activities in the Hungarian incident of October 1956 were a serious attack on the socialist camp following the Korean War. As stated in the resolution of the temporary Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the Hungarian incident was caused by several internal and external factors, and any one-sided explanation is incorrect. Among these factors, international imperialism "played a major and decisive role." After the counter-revolutionary restoration plot in Hungary was repulsed, the imperialists led by the United States, on the one hand, manipulated the United Nations to pass resolutions against the Soviet Union and interfering in Hungary's internal affairs, and on the other hand, stirred up a frenzied anti-communist wave throughout the Western world. Despite exploiting the failure of the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt to try to seize British and French interests in the Middle East and North Africa, the United States still declared that it would eliminate "misunderstandings" and achieve "closer and more intimate understanding" with Britain and France to re-establish a united front against communism, against the peoples of Asia and Africa, and against all peace-loving peoples of the world. For the purpose of anti-communism, anti-people, and anti-peace, imperialist countries should unite—this is the main meaning of what Dulles said at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting about "the need for a philosophy of life and action at this critical juncture in world history." Dulles, somewhat intoxicated, asserted: "The structure of the Soviet Communist Party is in a state of deterioration (?), and the power of the rulers is collapsing (?)... Faced with this situation, the free countries must maintain moral pressure, which helps to destroy the Soviet-Chinese communist system, helps to maintain military strength and resolve." He called on the North Atlantic Treaty countries to "crush the powerful autocratic political system of the Soviet Union based on militarism (?) and atheistic ideas (?)" and believed that "changing the nature of the communist world seems possible now!"

We have always believed that the enemy is our best teacher. Now Dulles is giving us another lesson. He can slander us a thousand times and curse us ten thousand times, which is nothing new. However, his demand from a "philosophical" standpoint that the imperialist world should place the contradiction with communism above all other contradictions, and that everything should be for "changing the nature of the communist world" and "destroying" and "crushing" the socialist system led by the Soviet Union, although it is undoubtedly futile for them, gives us a very beneficial lesson. Despite our consistent advocacy and continued advocacy for peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between socialist and capitalist countries, imperialists are always trying to eliminate us. Therefore, we must never forget the serious struggle between the enemy and us, which is the class struggle on a global scale.

There are two types of contradictions before us: the first is the contradiction between enemies (between the imperialist camp and the socialist camp, between imperialism and the peoples of the world and oppressed nations, between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat within imperialist countries, etc.). This is the fundamental contradiction, and its basis is the conflict of interests between opposing classes. The second is the contradiction within the people (between one part of the people and another part, between one part of the comrades within the Communist Party and another part, between the government of a socialist country and its people, between socialist countries, between communist parties, etc.). This is a non-fundamental contradiction, and its occurrence is not due to a fundamental conflict of class interests, but due to the contradiction between correct and incorrect views, or due to partial conflicts of interests. Its resolution must first serve the overall interests of the struggle against the enemy. The contradictions within the people can and should be resolved from the desire for unity, through criticism or struggle, and thus achieve new unity under new conditions. Of course, the actual situation is complex. Sometimes, to deal with the main common enemy, classes with fundamental conflicts of interests can also unite. Conversely, in certain situations, some contradictions within the people, due to one side of the contradiction gradually turning to the enemy side, can gradually turn into antagonistic contradictions. In the end, this contradiction completely changes and no longer belongs to the category of contradictions within the people, but becomes part of the contradiction between enemies. This phenomenon has occurred in the history of the Soviet Communist Party and the Chinese Communist Party. In short, as long as one stands on the side of the people, one should never equate the contradictions within the people with the contradictions between enemies, or confuse them, let alone place the contradictions within the people above the contradictions between enemies. Those who deny class struggle and do not distinguish between enemies and the people are not communists, not Marxists-Leninists.

Before discussing the issues we want to discuss, we believe that we must first resolve this fundamental stance issue. Otherwise, we will inevitably lose our way and will not be able to correctly interpret international phenomena.

I

The attacks by imperialists on the international communist movement have long been mainly focused on the Soviet Union. In recent times, the debates within the international communist movement have also been largely related to the understanding of the Soviet Union. Therefore, correctly assessing the basic path of the Soviet revolution and construction is an important question that Marxists-Leninists must answer.

The Marxist theory of proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat is a scientific summary of the experience of the workers' movement. However, except for the Paris Commune, which lasted only seventy-two days, Marx and Engels did not personally witness the realization of the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat for which they had struggled all their lives. Under the leadership of Lenin and the Soviet Communist Party, the Russian proletariat successfully realized the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat in 1917 and then successfully built a socialist society. Scientific socialism thus transformed from theory and ideal into a living reality. In this way, the October Revolution of 1917 not only opened up a new era in the history of the communist movement but also opened up a new era in the entire history of humanity.

In the thirty-nine years since the revolution, the Soviet Union has achieved tremendous successes. With the elimination of the exploitation system, the Soviet Union eliminated the state of anarchy, crises, and unemployment in economic life. The economy and culture of the Soviet Union developed at a speed unmatched by capitalist countries. Its total industrial output in 1956 had reached thirty times that of the highest year before the revolution, 1913. A country that was industrially backward and had a large number of illiterates before the revolution has now become the second industrial power in the world, possessing the world's advanced scientific and technological strength and highly developed socialist culture. The Soviet working people, who were oppressed before the revolution, have become the masters of the state and society. They have shown great enthusiasm and creativity in revolutionary struggle and construction work, and their material and cultural lives have undergone fundamental changes. Before the October Revolution, Russia was a prison for various domestic nationalities, but after the October Revolution, these nationalities quickly gained equal status and developed into advanced socialist nationalities.

The development of the Soviet Union was not smooth sailing. From 1918 to 1920, the Soviet Union was attacked by fourteen capitalist countries. Early Soviet Union experienced severe trials of civil war, famine, economic difficulties, and serious factional activities within the party. During the decisive period of the Second World War, before the Western countries opened the second front, the Soviet Union bore the brunt of and defeated the attacks of Hitler and his partners' several million troops. These harsh trials did not crush the Soviet Union and did not stop its progress.

The existence of the Soviet Union fundamentally shook the rule of imperialism and gave unlimited hope, confidence, and courage to all revolutionary workers' movements and national liberation movements of the oppressed. The working people of various countries aided the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union also aided the working people of various countries. The Soviet Union implemented a foreign policy of maintaining world peace, recognizing the equality of all nations, and opposing imperialist aggression. The Soviet Union was the main force in defeating fascist aggression on a global scale. The heroic Soviet army, in cooperation with the people's forces of the relevant countries, liberated Eastern European countries and parts of Central Europe, Northeast China, and North Korea. The Soviet Union established friendly relations with various people's democratic countries, aided the economic construction of these countries, and together with them formed a powerful bulwark of world peace—the socialist camp. The Soviet Union also provided significant support to the struggle of all oppressed nations for independence, to the struggle of the world's people for peace, and to many peace-loving countries in the Asia-Africa region that emerged after the Second World War.

All of the above are indisputable facts and are things that people have long known. Why then do we need to bring up these things again? This is because, while the enemies of communism have always tried to erase all of this, now some communists, when exploring the experience of the Soviet Union, often focus on the secondary aspects of things while neglecting the main aspects.

Regarding the experience of the Soviet revolution and construction, in terms of their international significance, there are several different situations. In the successful experience of the Soviet Union, some aspects have a fundamental nature and have universal significance in the current stage of human history. This is the primary and fundamental aspect of the Soviet experience. Another part does not have this universal significance. In addition, the Soviet Union also has some erroneous and failed experiences. Errors and failures, despite their different forms and degrees of severity, are unavoidable in any country at any time. And since the Soviet Union was the first socialist country, it had no successful experience to learn from, so its errors and failures were even more difficult to avoid. These errors and failures are extremely beneficial lessons for all communists. Therefore, the entire experience of the Soviet Union, including some erroneous and failed experiences, is worth our serious study, and its successful basic experience is particularly important. The development of the Soviet Union has proven that the basic experience of the Soviet revolution and construction is a great success, a resounding victory of Marxism-Leninism in human history.

What is the basic experience of the Soviet revolution and construction? In our view, at least the following experiences have a fundamental nature:

(1) The advanced elements of the proletariat organized into a communist party. This party, guided by Marxism-Leninism, is built on the principle of democratic centralism, closely linked with the masses, strives to become the core of the laboring masses, and uses Marxism-Leninism to educate its party members and the people.

(2) Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the proletariat, in alliance with the laboring people, seizes political power from the bourgeoisie through revolutionary struggle.

(3) After the victory of the revolution, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the proletariat, based on the alliance of workers and peasants, unites the broad masses of the people, establishes the dictatorship of the proletariat over the landlords and bourgeoisie, suppresses the resistance of counter-revolutionaries, implements the nationalization of industry, gradually implements the collectivization of agriculture, thereby eliminating the system of exploitation and private ownership of the means of production, and eliminating classes.

(4) The state led by the proletariat and the Communist Party leads the people in planned development of the socialist economy and socialist culture, gradually improving the living standards of the people on this basis, and actively preparing the conditions for the transition to a communist society.

(5) The state led by the proletariat and the Communist Party firmly opposes imperialist aggression, recognizes the equality of all nations, maintains world peace, adheres to the principle of proletarian internationalism, strives to obtain the aid of the working people of all countries, and actively aids the working people and oppressed nations of all countries.

The so-called "October Revolution path" we often talk about, abstracting from its specific forms at that time and place, refers to these basic things. These basic things are universally applicable Marxist-Leninist truths.

The process of revolution and construction in each country, in addition to having common aspects, also has different aspects. In this sense, each country has its own specific development path. We will discuss this issue later. However, from the basic principles, the path of the October Revolution reflects the universal laws of revolutionary and construction work in a specific stage of human social development. This is not only the broad road of the Soviet proletariat but also the common broad road that all proletariats must take to achieve victory. For this reason, the Political Report to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China says: "Although our revolution has its own many characteristics, Chinese communists regard their cause as a continuation of the great October Revolution."

Defending the path of Marxism-Leninism opened up by the October Revolution has particularly great significance in the current international situation. Imperialists claim to "change the nature of the communist world," and what they want to change is precisely this revolutionary path. For decades, all revisionists' opinions on Marxism-Leninism and the right-opportunist ideas they spread have also been trying to avoid this necessary path of proletarian liberation. The task of all communists is to unite the proletariat, unite the people, and resolutely repel the imperialists' savage attacks on the socialist world, and resolutely advance along the path opened up by the October Revolution.

II

People ask: Since the basic path of the Soviet revolution and construction is correct, why did Stalin's errors occur?

Regarding this issue, we have already discussed it in our article in April. However, due to the recent developments in the situation in Eastern Europe and other related circumstances, correctly understanding and correctly dealing with the issue of Stalin's errors has become a major issue affecting the internal development of many countries' communist parties and the mutual unity of communist parties, and a major issue affecting the common struggle of the world communist forces against imperialism. Therefore, it is necessary to further elaborate on our views on this issue.

Stalin has made great contributions to the development of the Soviet Union and the international communist movement. In the article "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat," we said: "After Lenin's death, as the main leader of the party and the state, Stalin creatively applied and developed Marxism-Leninism; in the struggle to defend the legacy of Leninism and against the enemies of Leninism—the Trotskyites, Zinovievites, and other agents of the bourgeoisie, he expressed the will of the people and was a outstanding Marxist-Leninist fighter. Stalin's support from the Soviet people, his important role in history, was mainly because he, together with other leaders of the Soviet Communist Party, maintained Lenin's line of industrialization and collectivization of the Soviet state, which made socialism victorious in the Soviet Union and created the conditions for the Soviet Union's victory in the war against Hitler, and these victories of the Soviet people are consistent with the interests of the working class of the whole world. Therefore, the name of Stalin naturally also enjoys very high honor in the world."

However, Stalin made some serious errors in both domestic and foreign policies. Stalin's personal authoritarian working methods had, to a certain extent, damaged the principle of democratic centralism in the life of the Soviet party and the state system, and undermined part of the socialist legal system. Due to Stalin's serious detachment from the masses in many of his works and his personal authoritarian decisions on many major policies, it was inevitable that he would make serious errors. This error was particularly evident in the issue of purging counter-revolutionaries and in the issue of relations with certain foreign countries. In the work of purging counter-revolutionaries, on the one hand, Stalin punished many counter-revolutionaries who deserved to be punished and basically completed the task on this front; but on the other hand, he wronged many loyal communists and good citizens, causing serious losses. In dealing with brotherly countries and brotherly parties, Stalin, in general, stood on the principle of internationalism, aided the struggles of the peoples of various countries and the development of the socialist camp. However, in handling certain specific issues, he showed a tendency of great-power chauvinism, lacked the spirit of equality, and did not even mention educating the broad cadres to adopt a humble attitude; sometimes he even wrongly interfered in the internal affairs of certain brotherly countries and brotherly parties, thus causing many serious consequences.

How should we explain these serious errors of Stalin? What is the relationship between these errors and the socialist system of the Soviet Union?

The dialectical method of Marxism-Leninism scientifically tells us that any mode of production and the superstructure established on the basis of this mode of production have their processes of emergence, development, and demise. When the productive forces develop to a certain stage, the old mode of production can no longer basically adapt to them; when the economic base develops to a certain stage, the old superstructure can no longer basically adapt to it. At this time, fundamental changes are inevitably brought about. Those who resist such changes will be abandoned by history. This law, in different forms, applies to all societies. That is to say, it also applies to the current socialist society and the future communist society.

Are Stalin's errors due to the fact that the socialist economic system and political system of the Soviet Union have become outdated and can no longer adapt to the needs of Soviet development? Of course not. The socialist society of the Soviet Union is still young, and it has not even been forty years since it was established. The rapid development of the Soviet economy proves that the economic system of the Soviet Union is basically adapted to the development of the productive forces, and the political system of the Soviet Union is also basically adapted to the needs of the economic base. Stalin's errors did not come from the socialist system; to correct these errors, it is certainly not necessary to "correct" the socialist system. The Western bourgeoisie wants to use Stalin's errors to prove the "errors" of the socialist system, which is completely groundless. Some people also want to use the management of economic affairs by the state power of a socialist country to explain Stalin's errors, believing that the government's management of economic affairs will inevitably become a "bureaucratic institution" that hinders the development of socialist forces, which is also unconvincing. No one can deny that the great rise of the Soviet economy is the result of the planned management of economic affairs by the state power of the laboring people, and Stalin's main errors have little to do with the shortcomings of the state organs that manage the economy.

However, even when the basic system is adapted to the needs, there are still certain contradictions between the mode of production and the productive forces, and between the superstructure and the economic base. This contradiction is manifested as certain defects in some links of the economic and political systems. This contradiction, although it does not need to be resolved by fundamental changes, still needs to be adjusted in a timely manner.

With the basic system adapted to the needs, and the daily contradictions in the system adjusted (according to dialectics, this is the stage of "quantitative change"), can we guarantee that no errors will occur? The problem is not so simple. The system is decisive, but the system itself is not omnipotent. No matter how good the system is, it cannot guarantee that serious errors will not occur in the work. After having the correct system, the main problem is whether it can be correctly applied, whether there are correct policies, correct working methods, and working styles. Without these, people can still make serious errors under the correct system and can still do ungood things with good state organs.

To solve the above-mentioned problems, it is necessary to rely on the accumulation of experience and the test of practice, which cannot be achieved overnight. Moreover, the situation is constantly changing, old problems are solved, and new problems arise, and there will never be a once-and-for-all solution. From this point of view, even in a socialist country with a solid foundation, there are still defects in some links of its mode of production and superstructure, and there are still deviations in the policies, working methods, and working styles of the party and the state, which is nothing strange.

In a socialist country, the task of the party and the state is to rely on the power of the masses and the collective to timely adjust the various links of the economic and political systems, and to timely discover and correct errors in the work. Of course, the subjective understanding of the leaders of the party and the state can never be one hundred percent in line with objective reality. Therefore, individual, partial, and temporary errors in their work are inevitable. However, as long as the scientific method of Marxism-Leninism's dialectical materialism is strictly adhered to and earnestly developed, and the democratic centralism of the party and the state is thoroughly adhered to, and the masses are earnestly relied upon, nationwide, long-term, and serious errors can be avoided.

The reason why Stalin's later errors developed into nationwide, long-term, and serious errors and could not be corrected in a timely manner is precisely because he, to a certain extent and to a certain degree, detached himself from the masses and the collective, and damaged the democratic centralism of the party and the state. The democratic centralism of the party and the state was damaged to a certain extent, which had certain social and historical conditions. This is: the party lacked experience in leading the state; the new system had not yet been consolidated to the extent of resisting all the influences of the old era (the process of consolidating the new system and the process of eliminating the old influences are not linear, and their certain undulating phenomena in the historical transition period are quite common); the tense struggle at home and abroad had a limiting effect on certain democratic developments; etc. However, these objective conditions alone are not enough to turn the possibility of making errors into reality. Under conditions much more complex and difficult than those faced by Stalin, Lenin did not make such errors. Here, the decisive factor is the state of mind. Stalin was intoxicated by a series of victories and flattery, and his method of thinking partially but seriously deviated from dialectical materialism and fell into subjectivism. He began to believe in his personal wisdom and authority, was not willing to seriously investigate and study various complex actual situations, was not willing to seriously listen to the opinions of comrades and the voices of the masses, and thus often made policies and measures that violated objective reality. Moreover, he often insisted on pushing these erroneous things for a long time and could not correct his errors in a timely manner.

To correct Stalin's errors and eliminate the consequences of these errors, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has taken steps and has already begun to achieve results. The Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union showed great determination and courage in dispelling the superstition about Stalin, exposing the seriousness of Stalin's errors, and eliminating the consequences of Stalin's errors. Marxist-Leninists and sympathizers of the communist cause all over the world support the Soviet Communist Party's efforts to correct errors and hope that the efforts of the Soviet comrades will be completely successful. It is obvious that since Stalin's errors are not short-term errors, the correction of these errors cannot be completely victorious in one morning. It requires a considerable amount of time and effort, and meticulous ideological education work. We believe that the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which has overcome countless difficulties, will certainly overcome these difficulties and achieve its goals.

The Soviet Communist Party's struggle to correct errors, of course, will not receive support from the Western bourgeoisie and right-wing social democrats. They, taking advantage of the situation, want to erase the correct aspects of Stalin, erase the great achievements of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp in the past period, and want to create confusion and division in the communist ranks. Their malice is obvious. Unfortunately, similar views are also being spread among some communists. We believe that it is extremely harmful for communists to adopt such views.

Everyone knows that despite making some serious errors in his later years, Stalin's life was that of a great Marxist-Leninist revolutionary. In his youth, Stalin fought against the tsarist regime and spread Marxism-Leninism, and after joining the central leadership of the party, he fought to prepare for the 1917 revolution, and after the October Revolution, he fought to defend the achievements of the October Revolution, and after Lenin's death, he fought for nearly thirty years to build socialism, defend the socialist motherland, and develop the international communist movement. On the whole, Stalin always stood at the forefront of the historical tide and guided the struggle. He was an implacable enemy of imperialism. Even when he made errors, his tragedy lay in the fact that he believed it was necessary to protect the interests of the laborers from being harmed by the enemy. In any case, although Stalin's errors caused unnecessary losses to the Soviet Union, the socialist Soviet Union still made great progress during Stalin's leadership. This indisputable fact not only shows the strength of the socialist system but also shows that Stalin was after all a staunch communist. Therefore, when we summarize Stalin's entire thoughts and activities, we must see both his positive and negative aspects, his merits and errors. As long as we observe the problem comprehensively, if we must say something about "Stalinism," we can only say that first, it is communism, it is Marxism-Leninism, which is the main aspect; second, it contains some very serious errors that must be thoroughly corrected and are contrary to Marxism-Leninism. Although it is necessary to emphasize these errors at certain times to correct them, it is also necessary to place these errors in an appropriate position in order to make a correct assessment and prevent people from misunderstanding. We believe that Stalin's errors, compared to his achievements, occupy only a secondary position.

Only by adopting an objective and analytical attitude can we correctly deal with Stalin and all comrades who made similar errors under his influence, and correctly deal with their errors. Since the errors of these communists are errors within the work of communists, this is a matter of right and wrong within the ranks of communists, not a matter of class struggle between enemies and us. We need to adopt an attitude of dealing with comrades rather than an attitude of dealing with enemies, and while criticizing their errors, we should protect their correct aspects and not deny everything about them. The errors of these comrades have social and historical roots, especially roots in ideological understanding. Such errors can occur in them and can also occur in some other comrades. Therefore, after recognizing and correcting their errors, we need to regard these errors as serious lessons, as a piece of property that can be utilized, to raise the awareness of all communists, thereby preventing the recurrence of such errors and promoting the development of the communist cause. Otherwise, if we adopt an attitude of denying everything towards these people who made errors, calling them this faction and that faction, and discriminating against and opposing them, we will not only fail to give our comrades the necessary lessons but also, by confusing the two types of contradictions of right and wrong and enemies and us, will objectively help the enemy to oppose the communist ranks and undermine the communist front.

In recent speeches, Comrade Tito and other leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, in our view, cannot be considered comprehensive and objective in their attitude towards Stalin's errors and other related issues. The comrades of Yugoslavia have a special resentment towards Stalin's errors, which is understandable. In the past period, the comrades of Yugoslavia made valuable efforts to persist in socialism under difficult conditions. Their experiments in democratic management in enterprises and other social organizations have also attracted attention. The Chinese people welcome the reconciliation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries with Yugoslavia, welcome the establishment and development of friendly relations between the two countries, and, like the people of Yugoslavia, hope that Yugoslavia will prosper and strengthen on the socialist path. We also agree with some of the points in Comrade Tito's speech this time, such as the condemnation of the Hungarian counter-revolutionaries, the support for the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, the condemnation of the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, and the condemnation of the French Socialist Party's pursuit of an aggressive policy. However, what surprises us is that he attacked almost all socialist countries and many communist parties in his speech. Comrade Tito determined that "the stubborn Stalinists... are trying to maintain their positions within the parties of various countries, and they once again hope to consolidate their rule, imposing this Stalinist tendency on their own people, and even on the people of other countries." Therefore, he declared: "We must join with the comrades of Poland to oppose the tendency that appears within the parties of other countries—whether Eastern or Western countries." We have not seen any speeches by the leaders of the Polish party that consider it necessary to adopt such an antagonistic attitude towards brotherly parties. Regarding Comrade Tito's views, we believe it is necessary to say that his use of so-called "Stalinism," "Stalinists," etc. as targets of attack, and his belief that the current issue is whether the line that began in Yugoslavia or the so-called "Stalinist line" will prevail, is incorrect. This can only lead the communist movement to split.

Title: The International Communist Movement and the Hungarian Question

The Hungarian question is a crucial issue that concerns the destiny of the international communist movement. Comrade Tito correctly pointed out: "From the perspective of whether Hungary's future will be socialist or counter-revolutionary, we must defend the current government of Kadar, and we must help it." However, the vice-chairman of the Federal Executive Council of Yugoslavia, Comrade Kardelj, in his lengthy speech on the Hungarian issue at the Federal National Assembly of Yugoslavia, is difficult to say that it is a defense and support of the Hungarian government. His speech not only gave a completely non-discriminatory explanation of the Hungarian events but also demanded that the Hungarian comrades "must fundamentally change the political system"; demanded that they hand over all power to the workers' councils in Budapest and other regions, "regardless of what the workers' councils become"; demanded that they "should not waste effort on restoring the Communist Party," "because to the masses, such a party is the embodiment of bureaucratic despotism." This is a typical example of the "non-Stalinist line" designed by Comrade Kardelj for the fraternal countries. The Hungarian comrades rejected this proposal by Comrade Kardelj. They dissolved the workers' councils in Budapest and other regions that were manipulated by counter-revolutionaries and steadfastly developed the Socialist Workers' Party. We believe that the Hungarian comrades did this completely correctly; otherwise, Hungary's future would not be socialist but counter-revolutionary.

The Yugoslav comrades have obviously gone too far. Even if they have some reasonable parts in their criticism of the fraternal party, their basic stance and methods violate the principles of comradely discussion. We do not want to interfere in the internal affairs of Yugoslavia, but what is said here is not an internal affair. For the sake of consolidating the unity of the international communist ranks and not giving the enemy the conditions to create chaos and division within our ranks, we cannot but offer fraternal advice to the Yugoslav comrades.

The serious consequence of Stalin's mistakes is the development of dogmatism. While various communist parties are criticizing Stalin's mistakes, they have also launched a struggle against dogmatism. This struggle is completely necessary. However, some communists, by adopting a completely negative attitude towards Stalin, by raising the erroneous slogan of opposing "Stalinism," have helped the development of the revisionist trend against Marxism-Leninism. This revisionist trend is undoubtedly beneficial to the imperialist attack on the communist movement, and in fact, imperialism is actively utilizing this trend. While we resolutely oppose dogmatism, we must also resolutely oppose revisionism.

Marxism-Leninism holds that there are common basic laws in the development of human society. However, there are also countless differences among different nations and peoples. Therefore, each nation experiences class struggle and will ultimately follow a path that is similar in some basic points but different in specific forms to socialism. Only by skillfully applying the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism according to the national characteristics can the cause of the proletariat in each country succeed. Moreover, as long as they do this, they will create their own new experiences and thus make a certain contribution to other nations and the entire treasury of Marxism-Leninism. Dogmatists do not understand that the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism can only be concretely manifested and take effect in real life through certain national characteristics. They do not seriously study the social and historical characteristics of their own country and nation and do not concretely apply the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism according to these characteristics. Therefore, they cannot guide the cause of the proletariat to victory.

Since Marxism-Leninism is the scientific summary of the experience of the workers' movement in various countries, it naturally cannot ignore the issue of applying the experience of advanced countries. In "What Is To Be Done?", Lenin said: "The movement of social democracy is fundamentally international. This does not only mean that we should oppose national chauvinism, but also that in young countries where the movement has just begun, it can only develop smoothly under the condition of using the experience of other countries." Lenin here is talking about the young workers' movement in Russia that must use the experience of the workers' movement in Western Europe. His view is also applicable to the issue of using Soviet experience in young socialist countries.

However, learning must have the correct method. All the experience of the Soviet Union, including the basic experience, is combined with certain national characteristics and is not something that other countries should copy verbatim. As mentioned earlier, there are also erroneous and failed parts in the experience of the Soviet Union. All these successful and failed experiences are priceless treasures for those who know how to learn. Because they can all help us avoid detours and losses. On the contrary, if we copy verbatim without analysis, then the experience that succeeded in the Soviet Union can also cause failure in other countries, let alone the failed experience. Lenin, in the passage we quoted above, immediately said: "But to truly use the experience of other countries, it is not enough to just know this experience or just copy the latest resolutions of other countries. For this, one must be able to view this experience with a critical attitude and independently examine it. Whoever thinks about the modern workers' movement that has developed and spread to such a vast extent will understand that to accomplish this task, one must have how much rich theoretical strength and political experience (and revolutionary experience)." Obviously, in countries where the proletariat has already seized power, the problem is even more complex.

In the history of the Chinese Communist Party, from 1931 to 1934, dogmatists denied the characteristics of China, copied some experiences of the Soviet Union, and caused serious failures in our country's revolutionary forces. This failure deeply taught our party. Our party, from the Zunyi Conference in 1935 to the Seventh National Congress in 1945, thoroughly rectified this seriously harmful dogmatic line, united all party comrades, including those who had made mistakes, developed the strength of the people, and thus achieved revolutionary victory. If we had not done this, victory would have been impossible. Because we overcame the dogmatic line, our party can now, when learning from the experience of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, avoid making some mistakes. Also, because of this, we can fully understand the necessity and difficulty of the Polish and Hungarian comrades in correcting the dogmatic errors of the past period.

The errors of dogmatism must be corrected at any time and in any place. We will continue to strive to correct and prevent such errors in our work. However, opposing dogmatism has nothing in common with tolerating revisionism. Marxism-Leninism acknowledges that the communist movement in various countries necessarily has its national characteristics, but this does not mean that the communist movement in various countries can have no basic common points and can depart from the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism. In the current anti-dogmatism trend, both at home and abroad, there are people who, under the pretext of opposing the copying of Soviet experience, deny the international significance of the basic experience of the Soviet Union, and under the pretext of creatively developing Marxism-Leninism, deny the significance of the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism.

Due to the serious errors committed by Stalin and other leaders of some socialist countries in the past in violating socialist democracy, some unstable elements in the communist ranks, under the pretext of developing socialist democracy, attempt to weaken or deny the dictatorship of the proletariat, weaken or deny the democratic centralism of socialist countries, weaken or deny the leadership role of the proletarian party.

The dictatorship of the proletariat must closely combine the dictatorship over counter-revolutionary forces with the broadest people's democracy, that is, socialist democracy. This is undeniable. The dictatorship of the proletariat is so powerful and can defeat the strong enemies at home and abroad and undertake the great historical task of realizing socialism precisely because it is the dictatorship of the laboring masses over the exploiters, the dictatorship of the majority over the minority. It is precisely because it has realized a democracy that any bourgeois democracy cannot realize for the broad laboring people. Without the close connection with the broad laboring people, without their active support, there can be no dictatorship of the proletariat, at least there can be no solid dictatorship of the proletariat. The more intense the class struggle, the more the proletariat needs to adopt the most resolute and thorough attitude, rely on the broad masses of the people, and mobilize their revolutionary enthusiasm to defeat the counter-revolutionary forces. The experience of the "red-hot" mass struggle during the October Revolution period and the subsequent civil war in the Soviet Union fully proves this truth. The "mass line" that our party often talks about is also learned from the experience of the Soviet Union at that time. The intense struggle in the Soviet Union at that time, which basically relied on the direct actions of the people, naturally could not have a perfect democratic procedure. After the exploiting class has been eliminated and the counter-revolutionary forces have been basically eliminated, although the dictatorship of the proletariat is still necessary for the domestic counter-revolutionary remnants (such remnants cannot be completely eliminated as long as imperialism exists), its main thrust should be turned to defending against the invasion of foreign imperialist forces. Under such conditions, it is necessary to gradually develop and improve various democratic procedures in domestic political life, strengthen socialist legal system, strengthen the supervision of the people over state organs, develop democratic methods in state management and enterprise management, strengthen the connection between state organs and enterprise management organs with the broad masses, remove obstacles that harm this connection, and further overcome the tendency of bureaucracy, rather than, like Stalin, emphasize the sharpening of class struggle after the class has been eliminated, thus hindering the healthy development of socialist democracy. The Soviet Communist Party resolutely corrected Stalin's errors in this regard, which is completely correct.

Socialist democracy, in any sense, does not allow itself to be opposed to the dictatorship of the proletariat, nor does it allow itself to be confused with bourgeois democracy. In political, economic, and cultural aspects, the sole purpose of socialist democracy is to strengthen the socialist cause of the proletariat and all laboring people, to develop their enthusiasm for building socialism, and to develop their enthusiasm for fighting against all anti-socialist forces. Therefore, if there is a kind of democracy that can be used to engage in anti-socialist activities and weaken the socialist cause, then such so-called "democracy" is definitely not socialist democracy.

However, some people do not understand the problem in this way. The reaction to the Hungarian events most clearly exposed this. In the past period of Hungary, the democratic rights and revolutionary enthusiasm of the laboring people were damaged, while the counter-revolutionaries were not properly suppressed, so that the counter-revolutionaries could easily use the dissatisfaction of the masses in October 1956 to organize armed rebellion. This shows that the past period of Hungary had not seriously established the dictatorship of the proletariat. However, when Hungary was at a critical juncture of revolution and counter-revolution, socialism and fascism, peace and war, how did some communist intellectuals in some countries raise the issue? They not only did not raise the issue of implementing the dictatorship of the proletariat but also came out to oppose the just actions of the Soviet Union in aiding the socialist forces in Hungary, came out to declare that the counter-revolution in Hungary was a "revolution," and came out to demand "democracy" for the counter-revolutionaries from the revolutionary government of workers and peasants! Some newspapers in individual socialist countries are still shamelessly slandering the revolutionary measures taken by the Hungarian communists who are heroically struggling under difficult conditions, but they are almost silent about the anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-peace wave of the world reactionaries. These strange facts prove what? These facts prove that those "socialists" who talk about democracy without the dictatorship of the proletariat are actually standing on the side of the bourgeoisie and opposing the proletariat, actually demanding capitalism and opposing socialism, although many of them may not have been aware of this. Lenin repeatedly pointed out that the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat is the most important point of Marxism; whether or not to acknowledge the dictatorship of the proletariat is "the deepest distinction between Marxists and vulgar petty bourgeois (and big bourgeois)." For the proletarian dictatorship established in Hungary in 1919, Lenin demanded that they "adopt ruthless, swift, and decisive force" to suppress the counter-revolutionaries and said: "Whoever does not understand this is not a revolutionary, and whoever does not have the qualifications to be a leader or advisor of the proletariat." It can be seen that if people, because they saw the errors committed by Stalin in his later period and the errors committed by the leaders of Hungary in the past period, deny the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism on the dictatorship of the proletariat, and slander this basic principle as "Stalinism" and "dogmatism," they will go down the road of betraying Marxism-Leninism and leaving the cause of the proletarian revolution.

Those who deny the dictatorship of the proletariat also deny that socialist democracy needs concentration, and deny the leadership role of the proletarian party in socialist countries. These arguments are, of course, nothing new to Marxist-Leninists. Engels, in his struggle against anarchism, pointed out long ago that in any social organization, as long as there is joint action, there must be a certain authority and a certain obedience. The relationship between authority and autonomy is relative, and their scope of application changes with the different stages of social development. Engels said: "To describe the principle of authority as absolutely evil and the principle of autonomy as absolutely good is absurd." He also said that whoever insists on this absurd idea is actually "serving the reactionaries." Lenin, in his struggle against the Mensheviks, thoroughly pointed out the decisive significance of the organized leadership of the party for the cause of the proletariat. In 1920, when criticizing the German Communist "Left," Lenin emphasized: "To deny the leadership of the party, to deny the role of leaders, to deny discipline, this is equivalent to completely disarming the proletariat to help the bourgeoisie. This is also precisely the petty-bourgeois tendency of laxity, vacillation, inability to endure, inability to unite, inability to act in unison, etc. If this tendency is allowed to run wild, any revolutionary movement of the proletariat will be doomed to failure." These principles, are they outdated? Are they not applicable to the special circumstances of some countries? The facts are obviously not so. The principles of Marxism-Leninism have undergone the test of the history of the international communist movement and the development of socialist countries, and so far, they have not encountered any situation that can be called an exception. The errors of Stalin are not due to the implementation of democratic centralism in state life and the leadership of the party, but precisely because he, to a certain extent and to a certain degree, destroyed democratic centralism and the leadership of the party. Correctly implementing democratic centralism in state life and correctly strengthening the leadership of the party over the socialist cause is the basic guarantee for the socialist camp countries to unite the people, defeat the enemy, overcome difficulties, and achieve great development. Precisely because of this, the imperialists and all counter-revolutionaries, in order to strike at our cause, always demand "liberalization" from us, always concentrate their efforts to destroy the leadership organs of our cause and the core communist party of the proletariat. They are extremely satisfied with the "unstable state" produced in some socialist countries due to the damage to the discipline of the party and state organs, and are using this situation to intensify their sabotage activities. This fact shows how important it is to maintain the authority of democratic centralism and the leadership role of the party for the fundamental interests of the people. There is no doubt that the concentration of democratic centralism must be established on the basis of extensive democracy, and the leadership of the party must be a leadership that is closely connected with the people. In these aspects, if there are shortcomings, they must be firmly criticized and overcome. However, the criticism of these shortcomings can only be for the sake of consolidating democratic centralism and the leadership of the party, and absolutely cannot, as the enemy wishes, cause the disintegration and chaos of the proletarian ranks.

Among those who, under the pretext of opposing dogmatism, revise Marxism-Leninism, some people even deny the boundary between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, deny the boundary between the socialist system and the capitalist system, and deny the boundary between the socialist camp and the imperialist camp. In their view, without the proletarian revolution led by the proletarian party, without the establishment of a state led by the proletarian party, some bourgeois states can build socialism, their state capitalism is already socialism, and even the whole of human society has already "grown into" socialism. However, while they are making such propaganda, the imperialists, against the socialist countries that have been established for many years, are mobilizing all possible military, economic, diplomatic, espionage, and "moral" forces to actively prepare to "destroy" and "break down" them. The potential and escaped bourgeois counter-revolutionaries in these countries are also trying to restore the old order. Although the revisionist trend is beneficial to imperialism, the actions of imperialism, however, are not beneficial to revisionism but prove the bankruptcy of revisionism.

To counter the attack of imperialism, one of the most urgent tasks of the proletariat in various countries is to strengthen the international unity of the proletariat. Imperialists and reactionaries in various countries, in order to achieve their goal of destroying the communist cause, are using the narrow national sentiments and certain national estrangements among the people of various countries to try every means to sabotage the international unity of the proletariat. Firm proletarian revolutionaries resolutely defend this unity and regard it as the common interest of the proletariat in various countries. The waverers are not clear in their position on this issue.

The communist movement has been an international movement from the beginning because only the joint efforts of the proletariat in various countries can defeat the common oppression of the bourgeoisie in various countries and realize their common interests. The international unity of the communist movement has greatly helped the development of the revolutionary cause of the proletariat in various countries.

The victory of the October Revolution in Russia gave a great impetus to the new development of the international proletarian revolutionary movement. In the 39 years since the October Revolution, the international communist movement has achieved extremely great achievements and has become a powerful political force in the world. All proletarians and all those who yearn for liberation in the world have placed all their hopes for the bright future of humanity on the victory of this movement.

In the past 39 years, the Soviet Union, as the first victorious socialist country, and after the appearance of the socialist camp, as the strongest and most experienced country in this camp, has been able to provide the greatest assistance to the various socialist countries and the people of the capitalist world. Therefore, it has always been the center of the international communist movement. This situation is not determined by anyone artificially but is naturally formed by historical conditions. For the common cause of the proletariat in various countries, for the common struggle against the attack of the imperialist camp led by the United States on the socialist cause, for the common rise of the economy and culture of the socialist countries, we must continue to strengthen the international unity of the proletariat centered on the Soviet Union.

The international unity between the communist parties of various countries is a completely new relationship in human history. The process of its development will inevitably encounter difficulties. The communist parties of various countries must unite and at the same time maintain their independence. Historical experience proves that if the two aspects are not correctly unified, and if either aspect is neglected, errors will be inevitable. When the communist parties of various countries maintain equal relations with each other, reach consensus and unity of action through genuine rather than formal consultations, their unity will be enhanced. On the contrary, if they impose their opinions on others in their mutual relations or use the method of interfering in internal affairs to replace comradely suggestions and criticisms, their unity will be damaged. In the socialist countries, because the communist parties have taken on the leadership responsibility of state life, and because the relationship between the parties often directly involves the relationship between states and the relationship between nations, the correct handling of this relationship becomes an even more important issue that needs to be treated with caution.

Marxism-Leninism has always insisted on combining proletarian internationalism with the patriotism of the people of various countries. On the one hand, the communist parties of various countries must educate party members and the people with the spirit of internationalism because the true national interests of the people of various countries require friendly cooperation among all nations. On the other hand, the communist parties of various countries must also be the representatives of the legitimate national interests and national sentiments of their own people. Communist party members have always been sincere patriots, and they understand that only when they correctly represent the national interests and national sentiments, they can truly gain the trust and love of the broad masses of their own people, can effectively carry out internationalist education among the people, and effectively coordinate the national sentiments and national interests of the people of various countries.

To consolidate the internationalist unity of the socialist countries, the communist parties of the socialist countries must respect each other's national interests and national sentiments. In the relationship between the party of a larger country and the party of a smaller country, this is particularly important. To avoid causing resentment in the smaller country, the party of the larger country needs to constantly pay attention to taking an equal attitude. Lenin was right when he said: "The conscious communist proletariat of various countries must be particularly careful and attentive to the national psychological residues in the countries and nations that have been oppressed for a long time."

As mentioned earlier, Stalin, in his treatment of the relationship between fraternal parties and fraternal countries, had shown certain tendencies of great-power chauvinism. The essence of this tendency is to ignore the independent and equal position of the communist parties of various countries and the socialist countries in international unity. This tendency has certain historical reasons. The old habits of the treatment of small countries by the old great powers will inevitably leave some influence, and a party or a country that has achieved a series of victories in the revolutionary cause will inevitably develop a sense of superiority.

Precisely because of this, to overcome the tendency of great-power chauvinism, systematic efforts are needed. Great-power chauvinism is not a phenomenon unique to a certain country. Country B is smaller and more backward than Country A, but it is larger and more advanced than Country C. Therefore, Country B, while complaining about the great-power chauvinism of Country A, often adopts the posture of a great power towards Country C. We Chinese people must especially remember that our country was also a great empire in the Han, Tang, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Although our country has been a semi-colonial country subjected to invasion since the mid-19th century and is now still an economically and culturally backward country, great-power chauvinism will become a serious danger if it is not vigorously prevented after the change of conditions. Moreover, it should be pointed out that this danger has already begun to show signs in some of our cadres. Therefore, the resolution of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China on November 1st both put forward the task of opposing the tendency of great-power chauvinism to their cadres.

However, what hinders the international unity of the proletariat is not only great-power chauvinism. Great powers in history have not respected or even oppressed small countries, and small countries in history have not trusted or even hated great powers. These two tendencies still exist to a greater or lesser extent among the people of various countries and even among the ranks of the proletariat. Therefore, to consolidate the international unity of the proletariat, in addition to first overcoming the tendency of great-power chauvinism in the larger countries, it is also necessary to overcome the tendency of nationalism in the smaller countries. Whether in large or small countries, if the communists oppose the total interests of the international proletarian movement with the interests of their own country and nation, use the former to oppose the latter, and do not seriously maintain the international unity of the proletariat in actual actions but damage this unity, this is a serious error against internationalism and against Marxism-Leninism.

The errors of Stalin have caused serious dissatisfaction among the people of some Eastern European countries. However, in these countries, some people's attitude towards the Soviet Union is not fair. Bourgeois nationalists exaggerate the shortcomings of the Soviet Union while ignoring its contributions. They try to make people not think about this: if the Soviet Union did not exist, how would imperialism treat these countries and their people. We Chinese communists are very pleased to see that the communist parties of Poland and Hungary are now seriously stopping the activities of those bad elements who spread anti-Soviet rumors and incite national antagonism among the fraternal countries, and are taking steps to eliminate nationalist prejudices among some of the masses and even some party members. This is obviously one of the urgent measures needed to consolidate the friendly relations between socialist countries.

We have pointed out before that the foreign policy of the Soviet Union in the past period was basically in line with the interests of the international proletariat, the interests of the oppressed nations, and the interests of the people of the world. The Soviet people have made great efforts and heroic sacrifices in assisting the cause of the people of various countries in the past 39 years. The mistakes made by Stalin cannot diminish the historical merits of the great Soviet people.

The efforts of the Soviet government to improve Sino-Soviet relations, the declaration of the Soviet government on October 30, 1956, and the talks with Poland in November 1956, have shown the determination of the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union to thoroughly eliminate the errors in their past foreign relations. The steps taken by the Soviet Union are a great contribution to strengthening the international unity of the proletariat.

It is clear that when imperialists are launching a frenzied attack on the communist ranks of various countries today, the proletariat of various countries needs to strive to strengthen their mutual unity. In the face of the enemy, those words and actions that hinder the unity of the international communist ranks, no matter what name they use, are difficult to expect to gain the sympathy of the communists and the working people of various countries.

Strengthening the international unity of the proletariat centered on the Soviet Union is not only in the interests of the proletariat of various countries but also in the interests of the national independence movements of the oppressed peoples of the world and the cause of world peace. The vast peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, based on their personal experience, can easily understand who their enemies are and who their friends are. Therefore, the anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-peace wave stirred up by imperialism can only find a cold response from a very small number of people in these continents with tens of billions of people. The facts have proved that the Soviet Union, China, other socialist countries, and the revolutionary proletariat of imperialist countries are loyal supporters of the anti-invasion struggle of Egypt, loyal supporters of the independence cause of the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In the struggle against imperialism, the three forces of the socialist countries, the proletariat of imperialist countries, and the countries struggling for national independence have common interests, and their mutual support has the greatest significance for the future of humanity and world peace. The recent period of imperialist aggression has once again caused a certain degree of tension in the international situation. However, relying on the joint struggle of the above three forces and the joint efforts of all other peace-loving forces in the world, this tense situation can be eased again. Imperialist aggression has not gained anything from its aggression against Egypt but has suffered a heavy blow. Due to the assistance of the Soviet army to the people of Hungary, the imperialist plan to create a warfront and break up the unity of the socialist camp in Eastern Europe has also failed. The socialist countries insist on peaceful coexistence with capitalist countries, insist on developing diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations with each other, insist on resolving international disputes through peaceful negotiations, insist on opposing the preparation of a new world war, and insist on expanding the peaceful regions and the scope of application of the five principles of peaceful coexistence in the world. All these efforts will gain more and more extensive sympathy in the oppressed peoples and peace-loving people of the world. The strengthening of the international unity of the proletariat will make the warlike imperialists dare not take risks lightly. Therefore, although imperialism is still resisting these efforts, the forces of peace will ultimately defeat the forces of war.

The history of the international communist movement, if counted from the founding of the First International in 1864, has only 92 years. In these 92 years, although there have been many twists and turns, the overall progress of the movement has been very rapid. During the First World War, the Soviet Union, which occupies one-sixth of the world's land, emerged; and after the Second World War, the socialist camp, which occupies one-third of the world's population, emerged. These socialist countries have made various mistakes, and the enemy is happy, and some comrades and friends are sad, and some of them even have doubts about the future of the communist cause. However, whether the enemy's joy, the comrades' and friends' sadness, or their doubts, are all without sufficient reason. The proletariat has taken on the management of the state for the first time, the earliest only a few years, the latest only a few decades, and it is impossible to require them not to suffer any failures. Short-term, local failures, not only in the past, but also in the present, and will still occur in the future. However, any far-sighted person will not feel disappointed and pessimistic because of this. Failure is the mother of success. The current short-term, local failures are precisely increasing the political experience of the international proletariat, thus preparing the conditions for the great success of the infinite future years. If we compare the history of the bourgeois revolutions in Britain and France, the failures in our cause are almost nothing. The bourgeois revolution in Britain began in 1640. However, after defeating the king, Cromwell's dictatorship followed. Then the restoration of the old dynasty in 1660 followed. It was not until 1688 that the bourgeois party, through a coup, welcomed a king from Holland who entered Britain with the Dutch army and navy, which stabilized the dictatorship of the British bourgeoisie. The bourgeois revolution in France, from its outbreak in 1789 to the establishment of the Third Republic in 1875, took 86 years, interwoven with progress and reaction, republic and empire, revolutionary terror and counter-revolutionary terror, civil war and foreign war, conquest of foreign countries and surrender to foreign countries, especially turbulent. The socialist revolution, although it is under the joint oppression of the reactionaries of the whole world, its entire path is much smoother and more stable. This precisely shows the unprecedented vitality of the socialist system. In the recent period, although the international communist movement has suffered some setbacks, we have obtained many valuable lessons from this. We have corrected or are correcting the errors that must be corrected in our ranks. After the errors are corrected, we will become even stronger and more united. Contrary to the expectations of the enemy, the cause of the proletariat will advance better rather than retreat.

However, the fate of imperialism is quite another matter. There, imperialism and the oppressed nations, imperialist countries and each other, imperialist governments and the people, have fundamental conflicts of interest, and these conflicts are becoming more and more acute, and no doctor can find a cure.

Of course, the newly born system of the proletarian dictatorship currently has many difficulties and weaknesses in many aspects. However, compared to the previous situation where the Soviet Union was fighting alone, we are much better now. Moreover, is there any new thing that does not have difficulties and weaknesses? The question is about the future. No matter how many twists and turns there are in the road ahead, humanity will eventually reach the bright destination of communism, and this is something that no force can stop.

    再论无产阶级专政的历史经验
    （这篇文章是根据中国共产党中央政治局扩大会议的讨论，由人民日报编辑部写成的）
    在一九五六年四月间，我们曾经就斯大林问题讨论过无产阶级专政的历史经验。从那个时候以来，在国际共产主义运动中，继续发生了一系列引起我国人民关切的事件。铁托同志在十一月十一日的演说和各国共产党对于这篇演说的评论，在我国报纸发表以后，再一次使人们提出了许多需要加以答复的问题。我们现在这篇文章将着重地讨论以下一些问题，就是：第一，关于苏联的革命和建设的基本道路的估计；第二，关于斯大林的功过的估计；第三，关于反对教条主义和修正主义；第四，关于各国无产阶级的国际团结。
    在观察现代国际问题的时候，我们必须首先从这样一个最基本的事实出发，就是帝国主义侵略集团同全世界人民力量之间的对立。饱受帝国主义侵略痛苦的中国人民永远也不会忘记：帝国主义从来就反对各国人民的解放和一切被压迫民族的独立，从来就把最坚决地代表人民利益的共产主义运动看作眼中钉。从第一个社会主义国家苏联出世以来，帝国主义就用尽一切手段来危害苏联。在一系列的社会主义国家成立以后，帝国主义阵营同社会主义阵营的对立，它对于社会主义阵营所进行的明目张胆的破坏活动，更成为世界政治中异常显著的现象。帝国主义阵营的首脑美国，在干涉社会主义国家的内政方面，作得特别凶恶无耻。它多年来阻挠着我国解放自己的领土台湾，多年来公开地把颠覆东欧各国作为政府的政策。
    帝国主义在一九五六年十月的匈牙利事件中的活动，是帝国主义在侵朝战争以后对于社会主义阵营一次最严重的进攻。正如匈牙利社会主义工人党临时中央委员会会议的决议所说，匈牙利事件是由内部和外部的几方面原因造成的，任何片面的解释都是不正确的，而在这些原因中，国际帝国主义“起了主要的决定性的作用”。在匈牙利的反革命复辟阴谋被击退以后，以美国为首的帝国主义者，一方面操纵联合国通过反对苏联和干涉匈牙利内政的决议，一方面在整个西方世界煽起疯狂的反对共产主义的浪潮。美帝国主义尽管利用英法侵埃战争的失败，竭力企图夺取英法在中东北非的利益，但是还是声明保证同英法消除“误会”，取得“更密切、更亲密的谅解”，以便重整共同反对共产主义、反对亚非人民和反对全世界爱好和平人民的统一战线。为了反共、反人民、反和平的目的，帝国主义国家应该团结起来——这就是杜勒斯在北大西洋公约组织理事会会议上所说的“在世界历史的这一紧要关头，必须有一套生活和行动的哲学”的主要含义。杜勒斯多少带着醉意地断言：“苏联共产党结构正处于恶化状态（？），而统治者的权力正在崩溃（？）……面对着这种形势，自由国家必须保持道义的压力，这种压力有助于破坏苏联—中国共产主义体系，有助于保持军事实力和决心。”他号召北大西洋公约国家“搞垮以军国主义（？）和无神论观念为基础的苏联强有力的专制政治（？）”，并且认为，“改变共产党世界的性质，在现在看来似乎是可能的事情”！
    我们从来认为敌人是我们最好的教师。现在杜勒斯又在给我们上课了。他尽可以污蔑我们一千次，诅咒我们一万次，这毫无什么新奇之处。但是他从“哲学”上要求帝国主义世界把对于共产主义的矛盾放在其他一切矛盾之上，一切都为了“改变共产党世界的性质”，“破坏”和“搞垮”以苏联为首的社会主义体系，这对于他们虽然肯定是徒劳的，对于我们却给了十分有益的教训。尽管我们一贯主张而且继续主张社会主义国家和资本主义国家应该和平共处，实行和平竞赛，帝国主义者还是时时刻刻都想消灭我们。因此，我们无论什么时候也不能忘记敌人同我们之间的严重斗争，这就是世界范围内的阶级斗争。
    在我们面前有两种性质不同的矛盾：第一种是敌我之间的矛盾（在帝国主义阵营同社会主义阵营之间，帝国主义同全世界人民和被压迫民族之间，帝国主义国家的资产阶级同无产阶级之间，等等）。这是根本的矛盾，它的基础是敌对阶级之间的利害冲突。第二种是人民内部的矛盾（在这一部分人民和那一部分人民之间，共产党内这一部分同志和那一部分同志之间，社会主义国家的政府和人民之间，社会主义国家相互之间，共产党和共产党之间，等等）。这是非根本的矛盾，它的发生不是由于阶级利害的根本冲突，而是由于正确意见和错误意见的矛盾，或者由于局部性质的利害矛盾。它的解决首先必须服从于对敌斗争的总的利益。人民内部的矛盾可以而且应该从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争获得解决，从而在新的条件下得到新的团结。当然，实际生活的情况是复杂的。有时为了对付主要的共同的敌人，利害根本冲突的阶级也可以联合起来。反之，在特定情况下，人民内部的某种矛盾，由于矛盾的一方逐步转到敌人方面，也可以逐步转化成为对抗性的矛盾。到了最后，这种矛盾也就完全变质，不再属于人民内部矛盾的范围，而成为敌我矛盾的一部分了。这种现象，在苏联共产党和中国共产党的历史上，都曾经出现过。总之，一个人只要站在人民的立场上，就决不应该把人民内部的矛盾同敌我之间的矛盾等量齐观，或者互相混淆，更不应该把人民内部的矛盾放在敌我矛盾之上。否认阶级斗争、不分敌我的人，决不是共产主义者，决不是马克思列宁主义者。
    在开始谈到我们所要讨论的问题之前，我们认为必须首先解决这个根本立场问题。否则，我们就必然会迷失方向，就不可能对于国际现象作出正确的解释。
    一
    帝国主义者对于国际共产主义运动的攻击，长期以来，主要地集中于苏联。而最近时期国际共产主义运动中的争论，也大都同对于苏联的认识有关。因此，正确地估计苏联的革命和建设的基本道路，是马克思列宁主义者所必须回答的重要问题之一。
    马克思主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说，是工人运动经验的科学总结。但是，除了只存在了七十二天的巴黎公社以外，马克思和恩格斯没有亲自看到过他们所毕生努力争取的无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的实现。俄国无产阶级在列宁和苏联共产党的领导之下，在一九一七年胜利地实现了无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，接着又胜利地建成了社会主义社会。科学的社会主义从此由理论和理想变为活生生的现实。这样，一九一七年的俄国十月革命，就不但在共产主义运动历史上开辟了一个新时代，而且在整个人类历史上开辟了一个新时代。
    苏联在革命以后的三十九年中获得了巨大的成就。随着剥削制度的消灭，苏联消灭了经济生活中的无政府状态、危机和失业。苏联的经济和文化，以资本主义国家所不能比拟的速度向前发展着。它的工业总产量，在一九五六年已经达到革命以前最高年份一九一三年的三十倍。革命以前工业落后、文盲众多的国家，现在已经成为世界上第二个工业强国，拥有世界上先进的科学技术力量和高度发展的社会主义文化。苏联劳动人民由革命前的被压迫者变成为国家和社会的主人翁，他们在革命斗争和建设劳动中发挥了巨大的积极性和创造性，他们的物质生活和文化生活的状况得到了根本的改变。十月革命以前的俄国本来是国内各民族的牢狱，而在十月革命以后，这些民族却得到了平等的地位，迅速地发展成为社会主义的先进民族。
    苏联的发展并不是一帆风顺的。苏联在一九一八年到一九二零年，受到了十四个资本主义国家的进攻。早期的苏联，经历过内战、饥荒、经济困难、党内宗派分裂活动的严重的折磨。在第二次世界大战的决定性的时间内，在西方国家开辟第二战场以前，苏联曾经独力承受了并且击败了希特勒和他的伙伴们的几百万军队的进攻。这些严酷的考验没有压倒苏联，没有阻止它的前进。
    苏联的存在，从根本上动摇了帝国主义的统治，而给予一切革命的工人运动和被压迫民族解放运动以无限的希望、信心和勇气。各国劳动人民援助了苏联，苏联也援助了各国劳动人民。苏联执行了维护世界和平、承认各民族一律平等和反对帝国主义侵略的外交政策。苏联是在世界范围内战胜法西斯侵略的主力。英勇的苏联军队同有关各国的人民力量合作，解放了东欧各国和中欧的一部、中国的东北部和朝鲜的北部。苏联同各人民民主国家建立了友好关系，援助了这些国家的经济建设，并且同它们在一起组成了世界和平的强大堡垒——社会主义阵营。对于全世界被压迫民族争取独立的运动，对于世界人民争取和平的运动，对于第二次世界大战以后新产生的亚非地区的许多和平国家，苏联也给予了重大的支持。
    以上所说的这一切都是不可争辩的事实，而且是人们早已知道了的。为什么现在还要再一次提起这些事情呢？这是因为，共产主义的敌人固然一贯地抹煞这一切，而现在有些共产主义者在探讨苏联经验的时候，也往往把注意力集中到事情的次要方面，而忽视了事情的主要方面。
    关于苏联的革命和建设的经验，就它们的国际意义说来，有几种不同的情况。在苏联的成功的经验中，一部分具有基本的性质，在人类历史的现阶段具有普遍意义。这是苏联经验中的首要和基本的方面。另一部分不具有这种普遍意义。此外，苏联还有一些错误的、失败的经验。错误和失败，尽管在表现形式和严重程度上各有不同，却是任何国家在任何时期都不能完全避免的。而苏联由于是第一个社会主义国家，没有成功的经验可以借鉴，它的一些错误和失败更加难于避免。这些错误和失败，对于所有共产主义者都是极其有益的教训。因此，苏联的全部经验，包括某些错误和失败的经验在内，都值得我们认真地加以研究，而它的成功的基本经验尤其重要。苏联发展的事实证明，苏联革命和建设的基本经验是一个伟大的成功，是马克思列宁主义在人类历史上第一曲响彻云霄的凯歌。
    什么是苏联革命和建设的基本经验呢？据我们看来，至少以下这一些经验具有基本的性质：
    （1）无产阶级的先进分子组织成为共产主义的政党。这个政党，以马克思列宁主义为自己的行动指南，按照民主集中制建立起来，密切地联系群众，力求成为劳动群众的核心，并且用马克思列宁主义教育自己的党员和人民群众。
    （2）无产阶级在共产党领导之下，联合劳动人民，经过革命斗争从资产阶级手里取得政权。
    （3）在革命胜利以后，无产阶级在共产党领导之下，以工农联盟为基础，联合广大的人民群众，建立无产阶级对于地主、资产阶级的专政，镇压反革命分子的反抗，实现工业的国有化，逐步实现农业的集体化，从而消灭剥削制度和对于生产资料的私有制度，消灭阶级。
    （4）无产阶级和共产党领导的国家，领导人民群众有计划地发展社会主义经济和社会主义文化，在这个基础上逐步地提高人民的生活水平，并且积极准备条件，为过渡到共产主义社会而奋斗。
    （5）无产阶级和共产党领导的国家，坚持反对帝国主义侵略，承认各民族平等，维护世界和平，坚持无产阶级国际主义的原则，努力取得各国劳动人民的援助，并且努力援助各国劳动人民和被压迫民族。
    我们平常所说的十月革命的道路，撇开它在当时当地所表现的具体形式来说，就是指的这些基本的东西。这些基本的东西，都是放之四海而皆准的马克思列宁主义的普遍真理。
    每个国家的革命和建设的过程，除了有共同的方面，还有不同的方面。在这个意义上说，每一个国家都有它自己的具体的发展道路。关于这个问题，我们将在后面去讨论。但是从基本原理上说来，十月革命的道路却反映了人类社会发展长途中的一个特定阶段内关于革命和建设工作的普遍规律。这不但是苏联无产阶级的康庄大道，而且是各国无产阶级为了取得胜利都必须走的共同的康庄大道。正是因为这个缘故，中国共产党中央委员会向党的第八次全国代表大会的政治报告中说：“尽管我国的革命有自己的许多特点，可是中国共产党人把自己所干的事业看成是伟大的十月革命的继续。”
    保卫十月革命所开辟的这一条马克思列宁主义的道路，在目前的国际形势下具有特别重大的意义。帝国主义者声言要“改变共产党世界的性质”，他们所要改变的正是这条革命道路。几十年来，一切修正主义者对于马克思列宁主义所提出的修正意见，所传播的右倾机会主义思想，也正是想避开无产阶级解放的这一条必由之路。一切共产主义者的任务，就是团结无产阶级，团结人民群众，坚决地击退帝国主义者对于社会主义世界的猖狂进攻，坚决地沿着十月革命所开辟的道路前进。
    二
    人们问道：既然苏联革命和建设的基本道路是正确的，为什么又发生斯大林的错误呢？
    关于这个问题，我们在四月间的文章中已经讨论过了。但是由于最近时期东欧形势以及其他有关情况的发展，正确地认识和正确地对待斯大林错误的问题，已经成为影响许多国家共产党的内部发展和各国共产党相互团结的重大问题，已经成为影响全世界共产主义队伍反对帝国主义的共同斗争的重大问题。因此，需要把我们对于这个问题的观点作一些进一步的申述。
    斯大林对于苏联的发展和国际共产主义运动的发展是有伟大功绩的。我们在“关于无产阶级专政的历史经验”一文中说过：“在列宁逝世之后，作为党和国家的主要领导人物的斯大林，创造性地运用和发展了马克思列宁主义；在保卫列宁主义遗产、反对列宁主义的敌人——托洛茨基分子、季诺维也夫分子和其他资产阶级代理人的斗争中，他表达了人民的意愿，不愧为杰出的马克思列宁主义的战士。斯大林所以赢得苏联人民的拥护，在历史上起了重要的作用，首先就是因为他和苏联共产党的其他领导人在一起维护了列宁的关于苏维埃国家工业化和农业集体化的路线。苏联共产党实行了这条路线，使社会主义制度在苏联取得胜利，并且造成了苏联在反希特勒的战争中取得胜利的条件，而苏联人民的这一切胜利是同全世界工人阶级和一切进步人类的利益相一致的。因此，斯大林这个名字也就很自然地同时在世界上享有很高的荣誉。”
    但是斯大林在苏联的内外政策方面都犯了一些严重的错误。斯大林的个人专断的工作方法，曾经在一定程度上损害了苏联党的生活中和国家制度中的民主集中原则，破坏了一部分社会主义法制。由于斯大林在许多工作中严重地脱离群众，个人专断地决定许多重大政策，因而就不可避免地要犯严重的错误。这种错误，特别明显地表现在肃清反革命的问题上和对某些外国的关系问题上。斯大林在肃反工作中，在一方面，惩办了很多必须惩办的反革命分子，基本上完成了这条战线上的任务；但是在另一方面，却冤枉了许多忠诚的共产主义者和善良的公民，造成了严重的损失。斯大林在对待兄弟国家和兄弟党方面，总的来说，是站在国际主义的立场上，援助了各国人民的斗争和社会主义阵营的发展的。但是，在处理某些具体问题的时候，他却表现了大国沙文主义的倾向，缺乏平等的精神，更谈不到教育广大干部采取谦虚的态度；有时他甚至错误地干涉某些兄弟国家和兄弟党的内部事务，因而引起了许多严重的后果。
    对于斯大林的这些严重的错误应该怎样解释呢？这些错误同苏联的社会主义制度的关系是怎样的呢？
    马克思列宁主义的辩证法科学告诉我们，任何一种生产关系以及在这种生产关系的基础上建立起来的上层建筑，都有它的发生、发展和灭亡的过程。生产力发展到一定阶段，旧的生产关系基本上不能再同它相适应；经济基础发展到一定阶段，旧的上层建筑基本上不能再同它相适应。在这样的时候，就必然要引起根本性质的变革。谁要抵抗这种变革，谁就会被历史所抛弃。这一规律，以不同的形态适用于一切社会。这就是说，也适用于现在的社会主义社会和将来的共产主义社会。
    斯大林的错误，是不是由于苏联的社会主义经济制度和社会主义政治制度已经过时，而不能再适应苏联发展的需要了呢？当然不是如此。苏联这个社会主义社会还是年轻的，它所走过的时间还不到四十年。苏联经济迅速发展的事实证明，苏联的经济制度基本上是适合于生产力的发展的，苏联的政治制度也是基本上适合于经济基础的需要的。斯大林的错误并不是由社会主义制度而来；为了纠正这些错误，当然不需要去
  “纠正”社会主义制度。西方资产阶级想用斯大林的错误来证明社会主义制度的“错误”，这是完全没有根据的。另外有些人想用社会主义的国家政权对于经济事业的管理来解释斯大林的错误，认为政府管理了经济事业就必然成为妨害社会主义力量发展的“官僚主义机构”，这也无法令人信服。谁也不能否认，苏联经济的巨大高涨正是劳动人民的国家政权有计划地管理经济事业的结果，而斯大林所犯的主要错误，却很少同管理经济的国家机关的缺点有关。
    但是在基本制度适合需要的情况下，在生产关系和生产力之间，在上层建筑和经济基础之间，也仍然存在着一定的矛盾。这种矛盾表现成为经济制度和政治制度的某些环节上的缺陷。这种矛盾，虽然不需要用根本性质的变革来解决，仍然需要及时地加以调整。
    有了适合需要的基本制度，也调整了制度中的日常性质的矛盾（按照辩证法，就是处在“数量变化”阶段的矛盾），是否就可以保证不发生错误了呢？问题没有这样简单。制度是有决定性的，但是制度本身并不是万能的。无论怎样好的制度，都不能保证工作中不会发生严重的错误。有了正确的制度以后，主要的问题就在于能否正确地运用这种制度，就在于是否有正确的政策、正确的工作方法和工作作风。没有这些，人们仍然可以在正确的制度下犯严重的错误，仍然可以利用良好的国家机关做出并不良好的事情。
    为了解决以上所说的这些问题，必须依靠经验的积累和实践的考验，不可能一蹴而就。而且，情况是不断变化的，旧的问题解决了，新的问题又产生了，任何一劳永逸的解决也是不会有的。从这种观点看来，就是在已经建立了巩固的基础的社会主义国家中，它的生产关系和上层建筑的某些环节也还有缺陷，在党和国家的政策、工作方法和工作作风方面，也还有这样那样的偏差，这并没有什么奇怪的地方。
    在社会主义国家中，党和国家的任务，就在于依靠群众和集体的力量，及时地调整经济制度和政治制度的各个环节，及时地发现和纠正工作中的错误。当然，党和国家的领导人员的主观认识，总不可能百分之百地符合于客观实际。因此，在他们的工作中，个别的、局部的、暂时的错误总是不可避免的。但是，只要严格遵守并且努力发展马克思列宁主义的辩证唯物主义的科学，只要彻底遵守党和国家的民主集中制，只要认真地依靠群众，全国性的、长时期的、严重的错误，却是可以避免的。
    斯大林后期的一些错误之所以发展成为全国性的、长期性的、严重的错误，而不能得到及时的纠正，正是因为他在一定范围内和一定程度上脱离了群众和集体，破坏了党和国家的民主集中制。党和国家的民主集中制之所以会受到某种破坏，有一定的社会历史的条件。这就是：党在领导国家方面还缺乏经验；新的制度还没有巩固到足以抵抗一切旧时代影响的侵袭（新制度的巩固过程和旧影响的消失过程，都不是直线的，它们的某种波浪式的起伏现象，在历史的转变时期是屡见不鲜的）；国内外的紧张斗争对于某些民主发展所起的限制作用；等等。但是仅仅这些客观条件并不足以使犯错误的可能性变为现实。在比斯大林所处环境更加复杂得多和困难得多的条件下，列宁却没有犯斯大林那样的错误。在这里，决定的因素是人们的思想状况。斯大林后期被一连串的胜利和歌颂冲昏了头脑，他的思想方法部分地但是严重地离开了辩证唯物主义，而陷入了主观主义。他开始迷信个人的智慧和权威，不肯认真地调查和研究各种复杂的实际情况，不肯认真地倾听同志们的意见和群众的呼声，以致使自己所决定的一些政策和措施往往违反客观实际情况。而且，他往往在一个长时间内固执地要推行这些错误的东西，而不能及时地改正自己的错误。
    为了纠正斯大林的错误，消除这些错误的后果，苏联共产党已经采取了步骤，并且已经开始取得了成就。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会，在破除关于斯大林的迷信、揭露斯大林错误的严重性、消除斯大林错误的后果方面，表现了巨大的决心和勇气。全世界的马克思列宁主义者和同情共产主义事业的人们，都支持苏联共产党纠正错误的努力，希望苏联同志的努力得到完满的成功。很明显，由于斯大林的错误不是一个短时间的错误，这个错误的纠正不可能在一个早上就得到完全胜利。它需要一个相当长的时间的努力，需要细致的思想教育工作。我们相信，曾经克服过无数困难的伟大的苏联共产党，必将克服这些困难，达到自己的目的。
    苏联共产党的这样一个纠正错误的斗争，当然不会从西方资产阶级和右翼社会民主党方面得到支持。他们为了乘机抹煞斯大林的正确方面，抹煞苏联和整个社会主义阵营在过去时期的巨大成就，为了乘机在共产主义队伍中制造混乱和分裂，硬把对于斯大林错误的纠正叫作所谓反对“斯大林主义”，叫作所谓“反斯大林分子”对于“斯大林分子”的斗争。他们的恶意本来是显而易见的。不幸，在某些共产主义者中间，也在那里传播着类似的说法。我们以为，共产主义者采取这种说法是极端有害的。
    大家知道，斯大林尽管在后期犯了一些严重的错误，他的一生乃是伟大的马克思列宁主义革命家的一生。斯大林在青年时代为反对沙皇制度和传布马克思列宁主义而斗争，在参加了党中央的领导机关以后为准备一九一七年革命而斗争，在十月革命以后为保卫十月革命的成果而斗争，在列宁逝世以后的近三十年中为建成社会主义、保卫社会主义祖国、发展世界共产主义运动而斗争。从整个说来，斯大林始终是站在历史潮流前面指导斗争的，他是帝国主义的不可调和的敌人。甚至在他犯错误的时候，他的悲剧也在于，他相信那是捍卫劳动者的利益不受敌人侵害所必需的。无论如何，斯大林的错误虽然对苏联造成了不应有的损失，但是在斯大林领导时期，社会主义的苏联还是大大地向前发展了。这个不可否认的事实，不但说明了社会主义制度的力量，而且也说明了斯大林毕竟是一个坚定的共产主义者。因此，我们在总结斯大林的全部思想和活动的时候，必须同时看到他的正面和反面，他的功绩和错误。只要我们是全面地观察问题，那么，如果一定要说什么“斯大林主义”的话，就只能说，首先，它是共产主义，是马克思列宁主义，这是主要的一面；其次，它包含一些极为严重的、必须彻底纠正的、违反马克思列宁主义的错误。尽管在某些时候为了纠正这些错误而对这些错误加以强调是必要的，但是为了作出正确的估价，不使人们发生误解起见，将这些错误放在适当的地位也是必要的。我们认为，斯大林的错误同他的成绩比较起来，只居于第二位的地位。
    只有采取客观的分析的态度，我们才能够正确地对待斯大林以及一切在他的影响下犯了类似错误的同志，才能够正确地对待他们的错误。他们的错误既然是共产主义者在工作中的错误，这就是共产主义队伍内部的是非问题，而不是阶级斗争中的敌我问题。我们就需要用对待同志的态度而不应该用对待敌人的态度来对待他们，就需要在批评他们的错误方面的同时，保护他们的正确方面，而不应该否定他们的一切。他们的错误有社会历史的根源，尤其有思想认识的根源。这种错误既可以在他们身上发生，也可以在某些别的同志身上发生。因此，在认识和纠正了他们的错误以后，就需要把这种错误看作严重的教训，看作一项可以利用的财产，用来提高一切共产主义者的觉悟，从而防止重犯这种错误，并且推进共产主义事业的发展。否则，如果对于这些犯错误的人采取否定一切的态度，把他们叫作这种分子那种分子，而加以歧视和敌视，就不但不能使自己的同志得到应有的教训，而且由于混淆了是非和敌我这两类性质不同的矛盾，势必在客观上帮助敌人反对共产主义的队伍，瓦解共产主义的阵地。
    铁托同志和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟其他领导同志在最近的言论中，对于斯大林的错误和其他有关问题所采取的态度，据我们看来，不能够认为是全面的和客观的。南斯拉夫的同志们对于斯大林的错误抱有特殊的反感，这是可以理解的。在过去时期内，南斯拉夫的同志们在困难条件下，作了坚持社会主义的可贵的努力。他们在企业和其他社会组织中实行民主管理的试验，也引起了人们的注意。中国人民欢迎苏联和其他社会主义国家同南斯拉夫取得和解，欢迎中南两国建立和发展友好关系，并且同南斯拉夫人民一样希望南斯拉夫在社会主义道路上日益繁荣和强盛。我们也同意铁托同志这次演说中的一些论点，例如对于匈牙利反革命分子的谴责，对于匈牙利工农革命政府的支持，对于英法以三国侵略埃及的谴责，对于法国社会党采取侵略政策的谴责。但是使我们惊异的是，他在演说中对于几乎所有社会主义国家和许多共产党都进行了攻击。铁托同志断定，“顽固的斯大林主义分子……在各国党内设法继续保持他们的职位，他们再一次希望巩固他们的统治，把这种斯大林主义的倾向强加在他们的人民的头上，甚至别国人民的头上”。因此，他宣称：“我们必须同波兰同志们一起来反对其他国家的——无论东方国家的或西方国家的——党内出现的那种倾向。”我们没有看到过波兰党的领导同志认为必须对于兄弟党采取这种敌对态度的言论。对于铁托同志的这些意见，我们觉得必须说，他把所谓“斯大林主义”、“斯大林主义分子”等等作为攻击的对象，并且认为现在的问题是“在南斯拉夫开始的”路线和所谓“斯大林主义路线”哪一个得胜的问题，这种态度是不正确的。这只能把共产主义运动引向分裂。
    铁托同志正确地指出：“从将来是社会主义还是反革命这样的角度来看匈牙利目前的发展，我们必须保卫卡达尔的现政府，我们必须帮助它。”但是南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会副主席卡德尔同志在南斯拉夫联邦国民议会上关于匈牙利问题的长篇演说，却很难说是对于匈牙利政府的保卫和帮助。他的演说不但对于匈牙利事件作了一种完全不分敌我的解释，而且要求匈牙利的同志们“必须从根本上改变政治制度”；要求他们把全部政权交给布达佩斯的和其他区域性的工人委员会，“不管工人委员会成了什么样子”；要求他们“不必在恢复共产党方面枉费心机”，“因为对群众来说，这样的党是官僚专制的化身”。这就是卡德尔同志给兄弟国家所设计的“非斯大林主义路线”的一个标本。匈牙利的同志们拒绝了卡德尔同志的这个建议。他们解散了被反革命分子所操纵的布达佩斯和其他区域性的工人委员会，坚持地发展了社会主义工人党。我们认为，匈牙利的同志们是作得完全正确的，否则匈牙利的将来就不会是社会主义，而是反革命。
    南斯拉夫的同志们显然是作得太过分了。即令他们对于兄弟党的批评有某些合理的部分，但是他们所采取的基本立场和方法都违背了同志式的讨论的原则。我们不愿意干预南斯拉夫的内部事务，但是这里所说的并不是内部事务。为了巩固国际共产主义队伍的团结，为了不给敌人在我们队伍中制造混乱和分裂的条件，我们不能不向南斯拉夫的同志们提出兄弟般的劝告。
    三
    斯大林的错误的一个严重后果是教条主义的发展。各国共产党的队伍在批判斯大林的错误的同时，展开了克服教条主义的斗争。这个斗争是完全必要的。但是一部分共产主义者由于对斯大林采取了否定一切的态度，由于提出了反对“斯大林主义”的错误口号，因而帮助了对于马克思列宁主义的修正主义思潮的发展。这种修正主义的思潮无疑是有利于帝国主义对于共产主义运动的进攻的，而事实上，帝国主义也正在积极地利用这种思潮。我们在坚决反对教条主义的时候，必须同时坚决反对修正主义。
    马克思列宁主义认为：在人类社会的发展中有共同的基本规律。但是在不同的国家和民族中间，又存在着千差万别的特点。因此，每个民族都经历着阶级斗争，并且最后都将沿着在一些基本点上相同、而在具体形式上各有不同的道路，走向共产主义。只有善于根据自己的民族特点运用马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，各国无产阶级的事业才能得到成功。而且只要他们这样做，他们就会创造出自己的新的经验，从而给别的民族和整个马克思列宁主义宝库作出一定的贡献。教条主义者不了解，马克思列宁主义的普遍真理只有通过一定的民族特点，才能在现实生活中具体地表现出来和发生作用。他们不肯认真地研究本国、本民族的社会历史特点，不肯根据这些特点具体地运用马克思列宁主义的普遍真理。因此，他们也就不可能指导无产阶级的事业达到胜利。
    马克思列宁主义既然是各国工人运动经验的科学总结，当然不能不重视运用先进国家经验的问题。列宁在“做什么？”一书中说过：“社会民主主义的运动，根本上就是国际的。这不仅是说我们应当反对本国沙文主义，而且是说在年轻国家内刚刚开始的运动，只有在它运用别国经验的条件下，才能顺利发展。”列宁在这里是说俄国刚刚开始的工人运动必须运用西欧工人运动的经验。在年轻的社会主义国家运用苏联经验的问题上，他的这个观点也是适用的。
    但是学习必须有正确的方法。苏联的一切经验，包括基本的经验，都是同一定的民族特点结合在一起的，都是别的国家所不应该原样照抄的。如前所说，苏联的经验中还有错误的、失败的部分。所有这些成功的和失败的经验，对于善于学习的人都是无价之宝。因为它们都可以帮助我们少走弯路，少受损失。反之，如果不加分析地原样照抄，那么，在苏联成功了的经验也可以在别的国家造成失败，更不要说失败的经验了。列宁在我们上文所引用的话下面紧接着说：“但是，要真能运用别国经验，单单认识这种经验或单单抄袭别国最近的决议，是不够的。为此就必须善于用批评的态度来看待这种经验，独立地检查它。谁只要想一想现代工人运动已发展和散播到了如何广大的地步，就会懂得，为了履行这个任务，该要有多少丰富的理论力量和政治经验（以及革命经验）。”显然，在无产阶级已经取得政权的国家，问题比列宁在这里所说的更要复杂许多倍。
    在中国共产党的历史上，在一九三一年到一九三四年间，教条主义者否认中国的特点，照抄苏联的某些经验，曾经使我国的革命力量遭到严重的失败。这个失败深刻地教训了我们的党。我们的党在一九三五年的遵义会议到一九四五年的第七次全国代表大会期间，曾经彻底地清算了这条为害严重的教条主义路线，团结了全党同志，包括犯过错误的同志在内，发展了人民的力量，从而取得了革命的胜利。如果不是这样做，取得胜利是不可能的。因为我们克服了教条主义路线，我们的党现在在学习苏联和其他兄弟国家的经验的时候，才有可能比较地少犯一些错误。也由于这样，我们能够充分了解目前波兰和匈牙利的同志们纠正过去时期教条主义错误的必要性和艰巨性。
    教条主义的错误在任何时候任何地方都是必须纠正的。我们将继续努力纠正和防止在我们工作中的这类错误。但是反对教条主义同容忍修正主义毫无共同之点。马克思列宁主义承认各国的共产主义运动必然有它的民族特点，但是这决不是说，各国的共产主义运动可以没有基本的共同点，可以离开马克思列宁主义的普遍真理。在目前的反对教条主义的潮流中间，在我们国内和国外，都有人借口反对照抄苏联经验，而否认苏联的基本经验的国际意义，借口创造性地发展马克思列宁主义，而否认马克思列宁主义的普遍真理的意义。
    由于斯大林和其他一些社会主义国家过去时期的领导者犯了破坏社会主义民主的严重错误，共产主义队伍中的一些不坚定的分子，就借口发展社会主义民主，企图削弱或者否定无产阶级专政，削弱或者否定社会主义国家的民主集中制，削弱或者否定党的领导作用。
    无产阶级专政必须把对于反革命力量的专政同最广泛的人民民主，亦即社会主义民主，紧密地结合在一起，这是不能有任何怀疑的。无产阶级专政之所以强有力，所以能够战胜国内外的强大敌人而负起实现社会主义的伟大历史任务，正因为它是劳动群众对剥削者的专政、大多数人对少数人的专政，正因为它对于广大劳动人民实现了任何资产阶级民主所不能实现的民主。离开了对于广大劳动人民的密切联系，离开了他们的积极支持，就不可能有什么无产阶级专政，至少不可能有巩固的无产阶级专政。阶级斗争愈是紧张，无产阶级愈是需要采取最坚决最彻底的态度，依靠广大的人民群众，动员他们的革命积极性来战胜反革命力量。苏联十月革命时期和紧接着的国内战争时期“热火朝天”的群众斗争的经验，充分地证明了这个真理。我们党所常说的“群众路线”，也就是从苏联当时的经验学来的。苏联当时的紧张斗争，基本上依靠着人民群众的直接行动，当然不可能具备完善的民主程序。到了剥削阶级已经消灭、反革命力量已经基本上肃清以后，无产阶级专政虽然对于国内的反革命残余（这种残余在帝国主义存在期间不可能完全肃清）仍然是必要的，但是它的主要锋芒就应该转向防御国外的帝国主义侵略势力。在这种条件下，当然应该在国内政治生活中逐步地发展和健全各种民主的程序，健全社会主义法制，加强人民对于国家机关的监督，发展国家管理工作和企业管理工作中的民主方法，密切国家机关和企业管理机关同广大群众的联系，撤除损害这种联系的障碍，进一步克服官僚主义的倾向，而不应该像斯大林那样，在阶级消灭以后仍然强调阶级斗争的尖锐化，因而妨害了社会主义民主的健全的发展。苏联共产党坚决地纠正了斯大林在这个问题上的错误，这是完全正确的。
    社会主义民主在任何意义上都不允许同无产阶级专政对立起来，都不允许同资产阶级民主混淆起来。无论在政治方面、经济方面和文化方面，社会主义民主的唯一目的，都是为了加强无产阶级和全体劳动人民的社会主义事业，为了发展他们建设社会主义的积极性，为了发展他们同一切反社会主义势力作斗争的积极性。因此，如果有一种民主可以被利用来进行反社会主义的活动，可以被利用来削弱社会主义事业，那么，这种所谓“民主”就决不是什么社会主义民主。
    但是有些人并不是这样认识问题的。对于匈牙利事件的反应，最显著地暴露了这一点。在过去时期的匈牙利，劳动人民的民主权利和革命积极性受到破坏，而反革命分子却没有受到应有的打击，以致反革命分子在一九五六年十月间能够很容易地利用群众的不满情绪，组织武装叛乱。这就说明了过去时期的匈牙利还没有认真地建立起无产阶级专政。但是，当匈牙利处在革命和反革命、社会主义和法西斯主义、和平和战争的紧急关头的时候，一些国家的共产主义知识分子是怎样提出问题的呢？他们不但没有提出实行无产阶级专政的问题，反而出来反对苏联援助匈牙利社会主义力量的正义行动，出来宣称匈牙利的反革命是“革命”，出来向工农革命政府要求给予反革命分子以“民主”！个别社会主义国家的某些报纸，至今还在放肆地诋毁在艰苦条件下英勇奋斗的匈牙利共产主义者所采取的革命措施，但是对于全世界反动派的反共、反人民、反和平的浪潮，却几乎默不作声。这些奇异的事实说明了什么呢？这些事实说明，那些离开无产阶级专政而高谈民主的“社会主义者”，实际上是站在资产阶级方面而反对无产阶级，实际上是要求资本主义而反对社会主义，虽然他们中间许多人或者并没有自觉到这一点。列宁曾经再三指出，无产阶级专政的学说是马克思主义的最主要之点；是否承认无产阶级专政，乃是“马克思主义者和庸俗小资产者（以及大资产者）之间的最深刻的区别”。对于一九一九年的匈牙利无产阶级政权，列宁曾经要求他们“采取严酷无情和迅速坚决的强力手段”来镇压反革命分子，并且说：“谁不了解这一点，谁就不是革命者，谁就没有资格当无产阶级的领袖或顾问。”由此可见，人们如果因为看到了斯大林后期所犯的错误，看到了过去时期匈牙利领导者所犯的错误，就否认马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政的基本原理，把这个基本原理污蔑为什么“斯大林主义”和“教条主义”，那就会走上背叛马克思列宁主义和离开无产阶级革命事业的道路。
    否认无产阶级专政的人们也否认社会主义民主需要集中，否认无产阶级政党在社会主义国家中的领导作用。这些议论，对于马克思列宁主义者说来，当然不是什么新东西。恩格斯在同无政府主义者斗争的时候早已指出，在任何社会组织中，只要有联合活动存在，就必须有一定的权威和一定的服从。权威和自治之间的关系是相对的，它们的应用范围是因社会发展阶段不同而有所改变的。恩格斯说：“把权威原则描写成绝对坏的东西，而把自治原则描写成绝对好的东西，这是荒谬的”。他并且说，谁要是坚持这种荒谬观念，谁就是在实际上“为反动派效劳”。列宁在反对孟什维克派的斗争中，透彻地指出了党的有组织的领导对于无产阶级事业的决定意义。在一九二零年批评德国共产主义“左派”的时候，列宁着重地指出：否认党的领导作用，否认领导者的作用，否认纪律，“这就等于完全解除无产阶级的武装以帮助资产阶级。这也就恰恰是小资产阶级的散漫、动摇、不能坚忍、不能团结、不能整齐动作等等的劣根性。这种劣根性如果任其横行，必使任何无产阶级的革命运动都会一败涂地。”这些原理是否过时了呢？是否不适用于某些国家的特殊情况呢？运用了这些原理，是否就会产生斯大林的错误呢？事实显然不是如此。马克思列宁主义的这些原理，经历了国际共产主义运动和社会主义国家发展的历史考验，到现在还没有遇到过一种可以称为例外的情况。斯大林的错误不是由于实行了国家生活中的民主集中制，实行了党的领导，恰恰是由于他在一定范围内和一定程度上破坏了民主集中制和破坏了党的领导。正确地贯彻国家生活中的民主集中制，正确地加强党对于社会主义事业的领导，乃是社会主义阵营各国团结人民、战胜敌人、克服困难而获得强大发展的基本保证。正是因为这样，帝国主义者和一切反革命分子为要打击我们的事业，总是向我们要求“自由化”，总是集中力量来破坏我们事业中的领导机构，来破坏无产阶级的核心共产党。他们对于目前某些社会主义国家中由于党和国家机关的纪律受到损害而产生的“不稳定状态”，表示了极大的满意，并且正在利用这种状况来加紧他们的破坏活动。这个事实说明，维护民主集中制的权威，维护党的领导的作用，对于人民群众的基本利益具有多么严重的意义。毫无疑问，民主集中制的集中必须建立在广泛的民主的基础上，党的领导必须是密切联系人民群众的领导。在这些方面如果发生了缺点，就必须坚决地加以批判和克服。但是对于这些缺点的批判，只能是为着巩固民主集中制，巩固党的领导，而绝对不能是像敌人所企求的那样，造成无产阶级队伍的涣散和混乱。
  　在借口反对教条主义而修正马克思列宁主义的人们中间，有些人索性否认无产阶级专政和资产阶级专政之间的界限，否认社会主义制度和资本主义制度之间的界限，否认社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营之间的界限。在他们看来，用不着经过无产阶级政党领导的无产阶级革命，用不着建立无产阶级政党领导的国家，某些资产阶级国家就可以建设社会主义，它们的国家资本主义就已经是社会主义，甚至全人类社会都已经在“长入”社会主义了。但是，正在他们进行这种宣传的时候，帝国主义对于已经建立了多年的社会主义国家，却正在动员一切可以动员的军事、经济、外交、特务和“道义”的力量，积极准备把它们“破坏”和“搞垮”。这些国家的潜伏的和逃亡到外国的资产阶级反革命分子，也还在力求复辟。修正主义的思潮虽然是有利于帝国主义的，但是帝国主义者的行动，却并不有利于修正主义，而是证明了修正主义的破产。
    四
    为了反对帝国主义的进攻，各国无产阶级的最迫切的任务之一，是加强无产阶级的国际团结。帝国主义者和各国反动派为了达到他们的毁灭共产主义事业的目的，正在利用各国人民中狭隘的民族感情和某些民族隔阂，来千方百计地破坏无产阶级的国际团结。坚定的无产阶级的革命派坚决地维护这个团结，把这个团结看成各国无产阶级的共同利益。动摇分子在这个问题上动摇不定，没有明确的立场。
    共产主义运动一开始就是国际性的运动，因为只有各国无产阶级共同努力，才能战胜各国资产阶级的共同压迫，而实现自己的共同利益。共产主义运动中的这种国际团结，大大地帮助了各国无产阶级革命事业的发展。
    俄国十月革命的胜利，给了国际无产阶级革命运动的新发展以巨大的推动力量。在十月革命以来的三十九年中，国际共产主义运动已经得到了极其伟大的成就，在世界范围内成为强大的政治力量。全世界无产阶级和一切渴望解放的人们，都把关于人类的光明前途的全部希望，寄托在这个运动的胜利上面。
    在过去的三十九年中，苏联由于是第一个胜利的社会主义国家，而在社会主义阵营出现以后，又是这一阵营中最强大和经验最丰富的国家，对于各社会主义国家以及资本主义世界的各国人民能够给予最重大的援助，所以它一直是国际共产主义运动的中心。这种情况不是任何人人为地决定的，而是历史条件所自然形成的。为了各国无产阶级共同事业的利益，为了共同反对以美国为首的帝国主义阵营对于社会主义事业的进攻，为了争取社会主义各国经济文化的共同高涨，我们必须继续加强以苏联为中心的国际无产阶级的团结。
    各国共产主义政党之间的国际团结，是人类历史上一种完全新式的关系。这种关系的发展过程当然不会没有困难。各国共产主义政党必须联合，同时必须保持各自的独立。历史的经验证明，如果不把这两个方面正确地统一起来，而忽视任何一个方面，就不能不犯错误。当各国共产党相互间保持平等的关系，经过真正的而不是形式上的协商而达到意见和行动的一致，它们的团结就会增进。反之，如果在相互关系中把自己的意见强加于别人，或者用互相干涉内部事务的办法代替同志式的建议和批评，它们的团结就会受到损害。在社会主义各国中，由于共产党已经对于国家生活担负领导责任，由于党同党之间的关系往往直接涉及国家间的关系和民族间的关系，这种关系的正确处理就成为一个更加需要慎重对待的问题了。
    马克思列宁主义从来坚持无产阶级的国际主义同各国人民的爱国主义相结合。一方面，各国共产党必须用国际主义的精神教育党员和人民，因为各国人民的真正的民族利益要求各民族的友好合作。另一方面，各国共产党又必须成为本国人民的正当的民族利益和民族感情的代表者。共产党人从来是真诚的爱国主义者，而且他们了解，只有在正确地代表了民族利益和民族感情的时候，他们才能受到本国广大人民真正的信任和爱戴，才能有效地在人民群众中间进行国际主义的教育，有效地协调各国人民的民族感情和民族利益。
    为了巩固社会主义各国的国际主义团结，社会主义各国的共产党必须相互尊重对方国家的民族利益和民族感情。在较大国家的党对待较小国家的党的关系中，这一点尤其具有重要的意义。为了不致引起较小国家方面的反感，较大国家的党需要经常注意采取平等的态度。列宁说得对：“各国有觉悟的共产主义无产阶级，对于遭受压迫极久的国家和民族内的民族心理残余，要特别慎重，特别注意。”
    如前所说，斯大林在对待兄弟党和兄弟国家的关系中，曾经表现过某些大国主义的倾向。这种倾向的实质，就是忽视各国共产主义政党和各个社会主义国家在国际联合中的独立平等地位。这种倾向有一定的历史原因。旧时代大国对待小国的积习固然还会留下某些影响，而一个党或者一个国家在革命事业中所取得的一系列胜利，也难免不使人们产生一种优越感。
    正是因为这样，为了克服大国主义的倾向，需要作有系统的努力。大国主义并不是某一国家特有的现象。乙国比甲国小和落后，但是比丙国大和先进，这样，乙国尽管埋怨甲国的大国主义，却往往同时对于丙国摆出大国的架子。我们中国人特别需要记住的是：我国在汉唐明清四代也是大帝国。虽然我国从十九世纪中叶以后的百年间成了被侵略的半殖民地，虽然我国现在还是一个经济文化落后的国家，但是在条件变化以后，大国主义倾向如果不竭力防止，就一定会成为严重的危险。而且应该指出，目前这种危险在我们的一些工作人员中已经开始露出了苗头。因此，中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的决议和中华人民共和国政府十一月一日的声明，都向自己的工作人员提出了反对大国主义倾向的任务。
    但是妨碍无产阶级国际团结的，不仅有大国主义。大国在历史上不尊重甚至压迫小国，小国在历史上不信任甚至仇视大国。这两种倾向在各国人民中以至各国无产阶级队伍中都还或多或少地存在着。因此，为了巩固无产阶级的国际团结，除了首先要在较大国家中克服大国主义的倾向以外，还必须在较小国家中克服民族主义的倾向。无论是在大国或是小国，共产党人如果把本国本民族的利益同国际无产阶级运动的总利益对立起来，借口前者而反对后者，在实际行动中不认真维护无产阶级的国际团结，反而损害这种团结，这就是一种违反国际主义、违反马克思列宁主义的严重错误。
    斯大林的错误曾经引起了某些东欧国家人民的严重不满。但是，在这些国家中，某些人对于苏联的态度也不是公正的。资产阶级民族主义分子竭力夸大苏联的缺点，而抹煞苏联的贡献。他们企图使人们不想到这一点：如果没有苏联存在，帝国主义将怎样对待这些国家和这些国家的人民。我们中国共产党人十分高兴地看到，波兰和匈牙利的共产主义政党现在已经在认真地制止那些制造反苏谣言、在各个兄弟国家的关系中煽动民族对立的坏分子的活动，并且着手破除在一部分群众中以至一部分党员中的民族主义偏见。这显然是巩固社会主义国家友好关系的迫切需要的措施之一。
    我们在前面已经指出，苏联过去时期的对外政策，基本上是符合于国际无产阶级利益、符合于被压迫民族利益、符合于世界人民利益的。苏联人民在过去的三十九年中，在援助各国人民的事业方面作了巨大的努力和英勇的牺牲。斯大林所犯的一些错误，决不能使伟大的苏联人民的这种历史功绩减色。
    苏联政府在改善苏南关系方面所作的努力，苏联政府在一九五六年十月三十日的宣言，以及在一九五六年十一月间同波兰的会谈，表示了苏联共产党和苏联政府彻底消除过去对外关系中的错误的决心。苏联所采取的这些步骤，对于加强国际无产阶级的团结，是一个重大的贡献。
    很明显，当帝国主义者向各国共产主义队伍进行疯狂进攻的今天，各国无产阶级需要努力加强相互间的团结。大敌当前，那些妨害国际共产主义队伍团结的言论和行动，无论用了什么名义，都难于指望获得各国共产主义者和各国劳动人民的同情。
    加强以苏联为中心的无产阶级的国际团结，不但符合于各国无产阶级的利益，也符合于全世界被压迫民族独立运动和全世界和平事业的利益。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的广大人民，从切身的经验出发，很容易了解谁是他们的敌人，谁是他们的朋友。因此，帝国主义所煽动的反共、反人民、反和平的浪潮，在这些洲的十几亿人口中只能找到极少数人的冷落的响应。事实证明，苏联、中国、其他社会主义国家以及帝国主义国家的革命无产阶级，是埃及反侵略斗争的忠实支持者，是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国独立事业的忠实支持者。在反对帝国主义的斗争中，社会主义国家、帝国主义国家的无产阶级和争取民族独立的国家这三种力量，具有共同的利害，它们的相互支援对于人类前途和世界和平具有最伟大的意义。帝国主义侵略势力最近时期重新造成了国际形势的一定程度的紧张。但是依靠上述三种力量的联合斗争，加上全世界其他一切爱好和平的力量的共同努力，这种紧张状况是可以重新转向和缓的。帝国主义侵略势力不但没有从对埃及的侵略中得到什么东西，反而遭到了沉重的打击。由于苏联军队对于匈牙利人民的援助，帝国主义在东欧制造战争前哨阵地和破裂社会主义阵营团结的计划，也已经归于失败。社会主义各国坚持同资本主义国家和平共处，坚持发展相互间的外交关系和经济文化关系，坚持以和平谈判解决国际争端，坚持反对准备新的世界战争，坚持在全世界扩大和平地区、扩大和平共处五项原则的应用范围。所有这些努力，必将在全世界被压迫民族和爱好和平的人民中获得愈来愈广泛的同情。国际无产阶级团结的加强，更将使帝国主义好战分子不敢轻于冒险。因此，尽管帝国主义还在抵抗这些努力，但是和平的力量终将战胜战争的力量。
    国际共产主义运动的历史，如果从一八六四年第一国际成立的时候算起，到现在还只有九十二年。在这九十二年中，虽然有许多迂回曲折，但是整个运动的进展是十分迅速的。在第一次世界大战期间，出现了占世界土地六分之一的苏联；而在第二次世界大战以后，又出现了占世界人口三分之一的社会主义阵营。这些社会主义国家犯了一些这样那样的错误，敌人就高兴起来了，有些同志和朋友就难过起来了，其中有一些人甚至对于共产主义事业的前途发生了动摇。但是无论敌人的高兴、同志和朋友的难过或者动摇，都是没有充足理由的。无产阶级初次担负国家的管理，迟的只有几年，早的也只有几十年，要求他们不遭到任何失败是不可能的。短时间的、局部范围的失败，不但过去有，现在有，将来也还会有。但是任何有远见的人决不会为此而感觉失望和悲观。失败是成功之母。目前的短时间的局部性的失败，正是增加了国际无产阶级的政治经验，从而为无限的将来岁月的伟大成功准备条件。如果拿英国资产阶级革命和法国资产阶级革命的历史来比较，我们事业中的这些失败就简直算不得什么。英国的资产阶级革命，开始于一六四零年。但是在战胜了国王以后，接着就出现了克伦威尔的独裁统治。接着又出现了一六六零年的旧王朝的复辟。直到一六八八年，资产阶级政党以政变的方式从荷兰迎来了一个带着荷兰海陆军进入英国的国王，这才使英国的资产阶级专政稳定下来。法国资产阶级革命从一七八九年爆发到一八七五年第三次共和国成立，经过了八十六年，中间交织着进步和反动，共和和帝制，革命的恐怖和反革命的恐怖，内战和外战，征服外国和投降外国，尤其动荡不宁。社会主义革命虽然受着全世界反动派的联合压迫，它的整个道路却顺利和稳定得多。这正是说明了社会主义制度的空前强大的生命力。在最近一段时间内，国际共产主义运动虽然遭到了一些挫折，但是我们却从此得到了许多有益的教训。我们纠正了或者正在纠正我们队伍中必须纠正的一些错误。在错误纠正以后，我们就会更加强大起来，就会团结得更好。同敌人的预料相反，无产阶级的事业将更好地前进而不是后退。
    但是帝国主义的命运却完全是另一回事。在那里，帝国主义跟被压迫的民族之间，帝国主义国家相互之间，帝国主义政府跟人民之间，存在着根本利害的冲突，这种冲突愈来愈尖锐，没有一个医生能够找出医治的药方。
    当然，新生的无产阶级专政的体系，目前在许多方面还有许多困难，还有许多弱点。但是比之以前苏联孤军奋斗的情况，我们现在是好得多了。而且，哪有一种新生的事物没有困难和弱点呢？问题是在于未来。我们前面的道路无论还有多少曲折，人类最后总是要走到光明的目的地——共产主义，这是没有任何力量可以阻止的。
