Xinhua News Agency, December 20th: Significant achievements have been made in plant protection work across the country this year.

The area treated with pesticides for pest and disease control this year exceeded 400 million mu, doubling the area from last year. Due to the adoption of active prevention and control measures that combined pesticides with manual labor and prioritized prevention over treatment, the threat of pests and diseases to crop growth was greatly reduced this year, playing a significant role in ensuring increased agricultural production this year.

This year, various regions have also showcased many examples of effective large-scale pest and disease control. In Liling County, Hunan Province, 35,000 mu of double-cropping rice paddies were essentially spared from rice stem borer damage due to thorough winter control of rice borers and a series of prevention and control measures, including the focused use of pesticides. In Chao'an County, Guangdong Province, a comprehensive method of controlling rice stem borers, which included "prevention" (spring irrigation and plowing), "avoidance" (switching to early-maturing and late-maturing varieties), and "treatment" (using 666 pesticide), was implemented in vast rice paddies, reducing the pest damage rate from 30% in 1949 to below 1% this year. This year, Tianzhen County, Shanxi Province, also achieved significant increases in potato production by adopting methods such as transferring improved varieties, vernalizing and sunning seeds, spraying pesticides, and storing seeds in cold cellars to prevent and control potato late blight.

To prevent the spread of dangerous crop pests and diseases, all regions have emphasized the quarantine of seeds and seedlings transferred between provinces and promoted locally this year. According to statistics from seven provinces, including Hubei and Sichuan, over 300 million jin of various seeds and over 10 million seedlings of various kinds have been quarantined, inspected, and disinfected this year; other provinces and regions have also done a lot of work in plant quarantine.

In addition, 161 prediction and forecasting stations (offices), more than 1,400 information points, and more than 100 grassroots plant quarantine and plant protection stations were established nationwide this year. These institutions collaborated with local colleges and universities, secondary agricultural schools, and agricultural science research departments to conduct large-scale surveys of dangerous pests and diseases, and have initially clarified the distribution of many dangerous diseases, pests, and weeds, providing a reliable basis for future plant quarantine and pest and disease control work.

    全国植物保护工作成绩很大
    用药剂防治病虫害的面积达四亿亩以上
    新华社20日讯　今年全国各地植物保护工作做得很有成绩。
    今年用药剂防治病虫害的面积达四亿亩以上，比去年增加了一倍。由于各地采用了药剂与人工相结合和防重于治的积极的防治措施，今年病虫害对农作物生长的威胁大大减轻，对于保证今年农业增产起了很大作用。
    今年各地还出现了不少大面积防治病虫害获得成效的范例。湖南省醴陵县有三万五千亩双季连作稻田，因为进行了彻底的冬季治螟工作和重点使用农药等一系列的防治措施，使稻禾基本上免除了稻螟的为害。广东省潮安县也在广大的稻田里，对水稻螟虫采取了“防”（春灌水、犁田）、“避”（改用早熟和晚熟品种）、“治”（用六六六农药）的综合治螟方法，使今年的螟虫为害率由1949年的30％降低到1％以下。山西省天镇县今年也由于采用了调运良种、春化晒种、喷洒药剂、冷窖贮藏等方法来防治马铃薯晚疫病，使马铃薯获得了显著增产。
    为了避免农作物危险病虫害的传播，今年各地重视了对在省与省之间调运和当地推广的种子、苗木的检疫工作。据湖北、四川等七个省的统计，今年经过检疫、检验和消毒的各种种子有三亿多斤，各种苗木达一千万株以上；其他省、区在植物检疫方面，也做了许多工作。
    另外，今年全国还建立了一百六十一个预测预报站（室）、一千四百多个情报点和一百多个基层植物检疫及植物保护站。这些机构同当地有关高等院校、中等农校及农业科学研究部门合作，对危险病虫害进行了较大规模的调查，初步摸清不少危险病、虫、杂草的分布情况，为今后开展植物检疫和防治病虫害工作，提供了可靠的根据。
