    Japanese Commodity Exhibition in Shanghai
    By our reporter
    The Japanese Commodity Exhibition in Shanghai successfully concluded yesterday. Last night, the halls of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building in Shanghai were brightly lit, and Chinese and Japanese friends toasted each other again and again, celebrating the success of this friendly gathering. The reception hall was filled with enthusiastic conversation, and bursts of warm applause echoed throughout. This lively scene was proof of the exhibition's success.
    From the opening day of the exhibition on December 1st, the people of Shanghai watched the exhibition with great confidence. For more than twenty days, the square in front of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building, where the exhibition was held, was filled with a continuous stream of people. More than 1.6 million visitors carefully viewed the dazzling array of more than 15,000 exhibits with cordial admiration. From these exquisite exhibits, people saw the creative wisdom of the Japanese working people. Many technicians and workers from Shanghai factories systematically observed and studied some valuable industrial products. In the industrial hall, many textile machines were often surrounded by large groups of Shanghai textile workers. Among them, an OM-S type super-high draft fine spinning machine with gray paint was the most attractive. This machine can stretch cotton slivers as thick as a finger one hundred to seven hundred times. After textile factories use this machine for production, they will no longer need roving frames, which can save a large amount of manpower and materials. Wei Shanghou, deputy secretary-general of the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Textile Engineering Society, praised its performance after seeing this machine, believing that it provided a model for our country to improve textile technology and equipment. A complete set of automatic typesetting machines was also one of the eye-catching exhibits in this exhibition. Using this automatic typesetting machine can save manual type casting and typesetting. It can cast and typeset ninety characters in one minute, and it can also use radio wave facsimile. Guo Rongshan and Chen Zude, Shanghai technicians who helped install these machines, said: We should humbly learn from the advanced aspects of Japan. Staff from some Shanghai daily-use industrial products factories were also interested in many exquisite daily-use industrial products, believing that there were many things worth learning. Liu Jingji, general manager of Anda Yarn Factory, repeatedly praised the various Japanese man-made fibers and fabrics he saw in the living fiber hall. He said: Japan is a country that lacks cotton, but thanks to the efforts of the Japanese people, it is said that man-made fibers currently account for 40% of textile raw materials. If we can develop in the man-made fiber industry, we will free up a large amount of land to grow food and other cash crops, which will greatly benefit socialist construction.
    One of the busiest places in the exhibition was the merchandise purchasing area. Long queues often appeared here. People often waited here for one or two hours to buy some Japanese goods. The strong interest of the Shanghai people in Japanese goods greatly excited the Japanese friends and made us see again the huge potential for developing Sino-Japanese trade. During the exhibition, Shanghai's trade representatives and Japanese business people had multiple contacts, discussed trade issues, and concluded some transactions. On December 8, Shanghai's international trade community held a banquet in the brightly lit Cultural Club to entertain the Japanese Commodity Exhibition Inspection Group that came to Shanghai. This banquet was also a friendly trade exchange. At small round tables and on sofas, trade representatives from both countries enthusiastically discussed each other's business operations. Mr. Kawabanata Taro of Japan's Daito Rubber Co., Ltd. took out samples such as rubber leather bags to introduce to Chinese friends. Some expressed the need for our country's tung oil, bristles, cowhide, and medicinal materials, while others expressed their willingness to export oil felt and diving suits.
    This Japanese Commodity Exhibition also carried out a variety of activities in Shanghai. They held a demonstration of "solar heat" machinery. Tractor operations were also demonstrated in the suburbs of Shanghai. Chinese and Japanese technicians held more than thirty technical exchanges and seminars, and also screened many Japanese films. These friendly activities were welcomed by the people of Shanghai. More than twenty days of contact and understanding in various aspects have left a deep impression on the Chinese people. The Japanese and Chinese people both love peace, and they need peaceful and friendly exchanges so much. At several gatherings, Japanese guests excitedly said: They must break through the current man-made obstacles and strive to establish normal diplomatic relations and normal trade relations between China and Japan. In the exhibition's suggestion book, the people of Shanghai also filled it with enthusiastic words. A viewer named Zhang wrote: I am very happy to see the crystallization of the labor and wisdom of the Japanese people at the exhibition. We are willing to be friends with the Japanese people.
    This is also the overall impression of all Shanghai audiences after visiting the Japanese Commodity Exhibition.

    日本商品展览会在上海
    本报记者
    日本商品展览会在上海的展出，已经在昨天胜利闭幕了。昨天晚上，上海中苏友好大厦的厅堂里灯火通明，中日两国的朋友们一杯又一杯的尽情干杯，祝贺这次友谊集会的成功。客厅里到处是热情洋溢的交谈，一阵一阵的热烈的鼓掌声不断地四处震响，这个热烈的场面，是展览会获得成功的证明。
    从12月1日展览会开幕这一天起，上海人民就怀着很大的信心注视着展览会。二十多天来，展览会所在的中苏友好大厦广场上，人群川流不息，一百六十多万参观者以亲切钦佩的心情仔细地参观琳琅满目的一万五千多件展览品。人们从这些精致的展览品中，看到了日本劳动人民的创造性的智慧。上海有不少工厂的技术人员和工人，对一些有价值的工业品，有组织地进行了观摩学习。工业馆的许多纺织机前面，经常聚集着大群的上海纺织工人。其中有一架灰色油漆的OM—S型超大牵伸精纺机最吸引人。这台机器能将指头粗的棉条拉长一百倍到七百倍，纺织厂用这种机器生产以后就可以不再用粗纱机，这样，就能节省大批的人力物力。中国纺织工程学会上海分会副秘书长魏上吼看了这部机器以后，赞扬它的性能，认为它给我国改进纺织技术设备提供了一个学习的榜样。一套完整的自动铸排机也是这次展览会中引人注意的展品之一。使用这种自动铸排机，可以节省人工的铸字和排字，在一分钟内，它能铸好和排好九十个字，而且还可以利用电波传真。帮助安装这些机器的上海技术人员郭荣善、陈祖德看了都说：日本先进的地方，我们应该虚心学习。上海一些日用工业品工厂的工作人员对许多精美的日用工业品也都感到兴趣。认为值得学习的地方很多。安达纱厂总经理刘靖基在生活纤维馆里看到多种日本人造纤维和织物一再称赞，他说：日本是个缺乏棉花的国家，而经过日本人民的努力，据说目前人造纤维占到纺织原料的40％，我们如果能在人造纤维工业上得到发展，就将空出很大数量的土地来种植粮食和其他经济作物，对社会主义建设的好处很大。
    展览会最热闹的场所之一是物品购买处。这里经常出现很长的队伍。人们为了能买到一点日本商品常常在这里等候一两个小时。上海人民对日本商品的这种浓厚的兴趣，使日本朋友们大感兴奋，也使我们再次看到了开展中日贸易的巨大潜力。在展览会举行期间，上海的贸易界人士和日本工商界人士进行了多次的接触，商谈了贸易的问题，并且成交了一些买卖。12月8日，上海的国际贸易界在灯火辉煌的文化俱乐部里举行宴会招待了来到上海的日本商品展览会视察团。这次宴会也是一次友好的贸易交流。在一张张的小圆桌边，在一台台的沙发上，两国的贸易界人士热烈交谈着彼此的经营情况。日本大东橡胶株式会社的川板田太郎先生拿出橡胶皮包等样品介绍给中国朋友。他们有的表示需要我国的桐油、猪鬃、牛皮和药材，有的表示愿意输出油毛毡、潜水衣。
    这次日本商品展览会还在上海进行了多种多样的活动。他们举行了“太阳热”机械的表演。在上海郊区还表演了拖拉机操作。中日两国技术人员举行了三十多次技术交流和座谈，还放映了许多日本电影。这些友谊的活动，都得到了上海人民的欢迎。二十多天的各方面接触和了解，给中国人民留下了深刻的印象。日本人民和中国人民都是爱好和平的，他们多么需要和平友好的交往。在几次集会上，日本客人们都激动地说：他们一定要冲破目前人为的障碍，为建立中日两国的正常邦交、建立两国正常的贸易关系而努力。在展览会的意见簿上，上海人民也写满了热情的语句。有一个姓张的观众写道：在展览会上我看到了日本人民的劳动和智慧的结晶感到非常高兴。我们愿意和日本人民友好。
    这也是所有上海观众们在参观了日本商品展览会以后的总的印象。
