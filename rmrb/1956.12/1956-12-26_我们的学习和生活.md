    Our Study and Life
    Zhang Zenglian
    Since the beginning of this semester, colleges and universities have further improved their teaching. Among the students of the Renmin University of China, great changes have taken place in their studies, lives, and political ideology, presenting a brand-new outlook. The students realize that reducing the excessive course load and allowing them to freely allocate their spare time is for the purpose of improving teaching and enhancing the quality of learning. These new measures have created favorable conditions for our studies, enabling us to better engage in independent thinking, unleash the enthusiasm and creativity in learning, and implement the educational policy of all-round development.

    Currently, students have generally enhanced their enthusiasm for learning. In all teaching aspects such as listening to lectures, self-study, class discussions, and special assignments, they pay attention to developing their independent thinking abilities. Among senior students, a trend has formed where anyone who simply copies or repeats what the teacher has taught during class discussions is considered to have not engaged in independent thinking in their studies. Many students, when preparing for class discussions, not only carefully read the reference books assigned by the teachers but also read a lot of relevant materials from newspapers and magazines, and they combine this with their own extracurricular special research to enrich and expand the content of class discussions. They can boldly engage in debates on different opinions, pursuing the truth.

    Many students who are doing well in their studies are squeezing out time to conduct some specialized investigations and research on top of doing well in their regular courses. For example, some students in Class 7 of the fourth grade in the Department of Planned Statistics are conducting specialized research on statistical survey issues. Some are studying averages in statistics, while others are translating articles from Russian magazines related to their major. Some students in the Department of Industrial Economics, after completing the part on the production reorganization after the overall public-private partnership in industrial economics, went to the Beijing Machinery Company and its affiliated major factories to conduct social surveys and wrote survey reports. Some students in scientific research groups wrote a paper entitled "Fixed interest is a special form of surplus value, and the law of surplus value still plays a role."

    In terms of political ideology, it is also more active than in the past. Students are very concerned about the development of current affairs, especially about the major events that have recently occurred in the international communist movement. Under the call of the Communist Youth League branches, everyone held seminars and conducted heated discussions.

    In terms of life, as students have gradually learned to arrange their own time, the phenomenon of Sundays being just another "day of the week" has been greatly reduced. Some students who haven't read a novel in several semesters have now read hundreds of pages of novels. The students' hobbies and specialties have been given full play compared to the past.

    From the above situation, the mainstream of students' learning, life, and political ideological changes after the improvement of teaching is positive, healthy, and vibrant. However, this does not mean that all negative phenomena do not exist in our school. When the new measures were first implemented, some bad phenomena were also discovered among the students. For example, some students played ping-pong near the dormitories during nap time, some students did not observe classroom discipline, did not listen carefully, were unwilling to participate in "labor and defense system" exercises, extracurricular activities became unorganized, did not observe the discipline of public places, squeezed during movie screenings, and some students made many requests and criticisms for entertainment activities, but were unwilling to do social work, and they also had more considerations and demands in life than in the past. But it should be analyzed that these phenomena are individual among the vast majority of students. At the same time, these phenomena were not produced after the implementation of the new measures, but existed in the past. Because ideological education work has not kept up in the new situation, and because the cadres doing educational work are afraid of students criticizing "too many restrictions," the problems that existed in the past have been exposed again. These phenomena should not be simply criticized and blamed, but should be persuaded and educated well. On the one hand, we must encourage the students to carry forward the positive factors well, and on the other hand, we must also point out the negative factors that have arisen. We must never abandon the weapon of criticism and self-criticism because we vigorously promote all-round development and oppose too many restrictions, and we must not remain silent or express clear attitudes about what is right and wrong reflected in real life. We must still grasp the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, enlighten and guide the masses to distinguish right from wrong, and carry out mass self-education. We should educate on the correct relationship between the individual and the collective, freedom and discipline, and democracy and centralism through concrete examples. In carrying out the above education, we can enable our generation of young people to better inherit the glorious revolutionary traditions and develop a fine style of hard work and plain living.

    The students' positive factors are the mainstream. We will certainly carry forward the positive factors to overcome the negative factors. We hope that in the process of ideological education, there will be specific analysis of specific situations, and there should be no generalization. For example, some students watched three movies in a week, and some people criticized him for watching too many movies. But if he does not go to the movies at other times (Saturday night, or Sunday) to compensate for this time, what is wrong with this reasonable allocation? Therefore, ideological education work is a deep and meticulous work, and it must be treated with analysis and research, and it cannot be solved in a simplistic way.

    我们的学习和生活
    张增琏
    本学期开学以来，高等学校进一步改进了教学工作。在中国人民大学的学生中，学习、生活、政治思想方面起了很大的变化，出现了崭新的面貌。同学们认识到减轻过重的课程负担，自由支配课余时间，是为了改进教学，提高学习质量。这些新措施为我们创造了学习上的有利条件，能更好地去进行独立思考，发挥学习的积极性和创造性，贯彻全面发展的教育方针。
    目前，同学们普遍地提高了学习的积极性，在听课、自修、课堂讨论、专题作业等各个教学环节中，注意锻炼独立思考能力。在高年级学生中形成了这样一种风气，谁要是在课堂讨论时照搬或单纯地重复老师讲授的内容，大家就认为他在学习上没有进行独立思考。许多同学在准备课堂讨论时，除认真阅读教师指定的参考书外，还看了许多报纸杂志上的有关资料，并结合自己的课外专题研究来丰富和充实课堂讨论的内容，对于不同的意见，能大胆展开争论，追求真理。
    许多学习较好的同学，在学好正课的基础上挤出时间进行一些专题性的调查研究。如计划统计系四年级七班的一些同学，进行关于统计调查问题的专门研究，有的研究统计中的平均数，有的翻译和专业有关的俄文杂志上的文章。工业经济系有的同学在学完了工业经济中关于全行业公私合营后的生产改组这一部分后，就到北京机械公司和其所属几个主要工厂进行了社会调查，并写了调查报告。有的科学研究小组的同学写出了“定息是剩余价值的特殊形态，剩余价值的规律还起作用”的论文。
    在政治思想方面比过去也活跃了。学生对时事的发展非常关心，尤其对最近在国际共产主义运动中发生的重大事件，更为关怀。大家在团支部的召集下，举行了座谈会，进行了热烈的讨论。
    在生活方面，由于同学们逐渐学会了安排自己的时间，过去星期天就是“星期七”的现象，已大大减少了。有的同学几学期来没看过一本小说，现在也看了好几百页小说了。同学们的爱好和特长比过去有了充分的发挥。
    从以上情况看来，在教学工作改进以后，学生的学习、生活、政治思想变化的主流是积极的、健康的、朝气勃勃的。但是，这并不等于说一切消极现象在我们学校里都不存在。在新措施开始实行时，在同学中也发现了一些不好的现象。如有的同学午睡时间在宿舍附近打乒乓球，有的同学不遵守课堂纪律，不好好听讲，不愿参加“劳卫制”锻炼，课外活动形成自流，不遵守公共场所的纪律，看电影时乱挤，有的同学对于文娱活动提出很多要求和批评，但是不愿作社会工作，在生活上也比过去有了较多的考虑和要求。但应该分析这些现象在广大同学中是个别的。同时，这些现象不是在新措施实行后产生的，而是过去就有的。由于在新的情况下，思想教育工作没有跟上去，也由于做教育工作的干部思想上怕同学批评“限制过多”，因此，过去存在的问题就又暴露出来了。对于这些现象不能单纯地批评和指责，应该很好地进行说服教育，一方面，要很好地鼓励同学们发扬积极因素，另一方面也要指出所产生的消极因素。我们决不能因为大力宣传提倡全面发展、反对限制过多，就抛弃了批评和自我批评的武器，对于反映在现实生活中的是和非不发言，不表示明确的态度。我们仍然要掌握批评和自我批评的武器，启发诱导群众明辨是非，进行群众性的自我教育。我们应当通过具体事例进行个人和集体、自由和纪律、民主和集中的正确关系的教育。在进行上述教育中，可以使我们这一代的青年更好地继承光荣的革命传统，养成艰苦朴素的优良作风。
    同学们的积极因素是主流。我们一定会发扬积极因素，去克服消极因素。我们希望在进行思想教育过程中，对具体情况有具体分析，不能一概而论。比如有的学生一个星期看了三次电影，就有人批评他看电影太多了。但是他在其他时间（星期六晚上，或星期天）却不去看电影，补偿这个时间，这种合理的调配又有什么不可以呢？所以，思想教育工作是一个深入细致的工作，一定要有分析有研究地对待它，不能用简单化的方式来解决。
