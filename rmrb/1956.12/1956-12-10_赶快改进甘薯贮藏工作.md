　　Hasten the Improvement of Sweet Potato Storage Work
　　Xin GuiFang
    Shandong Province has seen a widespread bumper harvest of sweet potatoes this year. Current estimates place the total output at over 30 billion jin, equivalent to more than 7 billion jin of grain, accounting for approximately one-quarter of the province's total grain output.

    The Party and government leading organs of Shandong Province attach great importance to the issue of sweet potato storage. As early as a month ago, the Shandong Provincial People's Committee issued instructions to help farmers harvest, store, and consume sweet potatoes well. Dazhong Daily also published an editorial on this matter. Many special districts and county people's committees have also successively convened sweet potato storage work meetings, analyzing the reasons why sweet potatoes easily rot, and summarizing and exchanging good experiences in sweet potato storage. However, in the recent month or so, the situation of sweet potato rot in various parts of Shandong is still quite serious, and there is a continuing trend of expansion. According to statistics from eight counties including Lijin and Pingyuan in late November, a total of 1.23 million jin of sweet potatoes had rotted; an inspection of 55,667 sweet potato cellars in ten districts including Tushanji in Cao County found that only 10% of the cellars had little or no spoilage; in Guangxintai Township, Cao County, out of 1,067 cellars, 856 cellars had sweet potatoes that had already begun to rot, with the slightly rotten tubers accounting for 30% and the severely rotten tubers accounting for over 50%; in Songzhuang District, Xin County, Zeng Guangfu Agricultural Cooperative only inspected three cellars, and over 10,000 jin had rotted. The direct reasons for sweet potato rot this year are: ① During harvesting and distribution, there was a lack of careful management, causing the sweet potatoes to be injured, making them difficult to preserve. ② When sweet potatoes were put into the cellars, those with black spot disease and severely broken skin were not picked out, and the good and bad were mixed together, contaminating the good ones. ③ The cellars were dug shallow, not up to standard, or overfilled. In the initial stage of storage, the moisture and heat released by the sweet potatoes had nowhere to dissipate, causing the temperature in the cellar to be too high and leading to rot.

    It is particularly worth mentioning that some county and district cadres do not pay enough attention to this work. They have not taken practical actions to implement the province's instructions, promptly going deep into the grassroots or the homes of cooperative members to carry out propaganda and organizational work, consulting with the masses on proper storage methods, and preventing the spread of rot. Some cadres even mistakenly believe that sweet potatoes are different from other grains, and this year's production has increased, so it doesn't matter if a little rots. Others believe that sweet potato rot is unavoidable, it happens every year, and there is no need to be alarmed. They do not recognize that this is a major event directly related to the people's livelihood, and are satisfied with general calls or wait until serious rot phenomena occur somewhere before intervening. This has led to the serious development of sweet potato rot in some places, wasting the results of the people's hard work for a year, which is very noteworthy.

    In fact, cooperative members have a lot of experience in preserving sweet potatoes. Farmers in various counties in Laiyang Special District and other sweet potato producing areas have accumulated rich experience in storing sweet potatoes. They can even preserve sweet potatoes until June or July of the following year without rotting. In Guanzhuang Township, Yanggu County, in the past, households that rotted sweet potatoes accounted for 80%. Liu Hongjun, a labor model in this township, has thirty years of experience in storing sweet potatoes. After he joined the cooperative in 1953, he introduced his experience, and the number of households in the whole cooperative that rotted sweet potatoes was reduced from 80% to 10%.

    Farmers in many areas of Shandong have long had the method of slicing sweet potatoes and drying them for storage. This method is still worth vigorously promoting. In addition, some places immediately separate the good from the bad when rot is first discovered; or adopt methods such as several families freely combining, eating whose sweet potatoes rot first, and exchanging with each other, which also effectively prevents the development of rot.

### 赶快改进甘薯贮藏工作

　　赶快改进甘薯贮藏工作
　　辛桂芳
    山东省今年甘薯普遍丰收。据目前估计：总产量可达三百亿斤以上，折合粮食七十余亿斤，约占全省粮食总产量的四分之一左右。
    山东省的党政领导机关，很重视甘薯贮藏问题。早在一个月以前，山东省人民委员会就发出了帮助农民收好、藏好、吃好甘薯的指示。大众日报也为此发表了社论。许多专署和县人民委员会也相继召开了地瓜收藏工作会议，分析了甘薯容易腐烂的原因，总结和交流甘薯收藏的好经验。但是，最近一个多月以来，山东各地甘薯腐烂情况还是相当严重的，并有继续扩大的趋势。据利津、平原等八个县11月下旬的统计，共腐烂甘薯一百二十三万斤；曹县土山集等十个区检查了五万五千六百六十七个甘薯窖，坏的很少或未坏的窖仅占10％；曹县光星台乡一千零六十七个窖，就有八百五十六个窖内的甘薯已开始腐烂，轻的烂块占30％，重的烂块占50％以上；莘县宋庄区曾广福农业社仅检查了三个窖，即烂一万多斤。今年甘薯腐烂的直接原因是：①在收刨和分配的时候，缺乏仔细管理，使甘薯受伤，不易保存。②甘薯入窖时，没把带黑斑病的和严重破皮的拣出来，好的坏的混在一起沾染坏了。③地窖挖的浅，不合规格或贮藏过满，贮藏初期甘薯放出的湿气和热气无处发散，使窖内温度过高、过大而腐烂的。
    特别值得提出的是，有些县、区干部对这个工作注意不够，他们并没有用实际行动来贯彻执行省的指示，及时地深入到基层或社员家中去进行宣传和组织工作，和群众商量妥善的贮藏办法，防止腐烂扩大。有的干部甚至还错误地认为：甘薯不同于别的粮食，今年又增产了，烂一点没关系。还有的人认为：甘薯腐烂不可免，年年如此，用不着大惊小怪。他们不认识这是直接关系着人民生活的大事，满足于一般的号召或等到哪里发生了严重的腐烂现象再去过问，这就使有些地方甘薯腐烂现象严重发展，使人民辛勤劳动一年的成果白白浪费掉，这是十分值得注意的。
    其实，社员是有很多保存甘薯的经验的。莱阳专区各县和其他甘薯产区，农民积累了丰富的贮存甘薯的经验，他们甚至可以将甘薯保存到第二年的六、七月份而不腐烂。阳谷县关庄乡过去每年烂甘薯的户占80％。这个乡的劳动模范刘鸿钧，有三十年贮藏甘薯的经验，1953年他入社后，把经验介绍出来，全社烂甘薯的户便从80％减到10％。
    山东很多地区的农民早就有把甘薯切片晒干贮存的办法。这种办法还是值得大力推广的。此外有的地方刚刚发现有腐烂现象，立即把好、坏分开；或采取几家自由结合、谁家烂了先吃谁的、互相串换等办法，也有效地防止了腐烂现象的发展。
