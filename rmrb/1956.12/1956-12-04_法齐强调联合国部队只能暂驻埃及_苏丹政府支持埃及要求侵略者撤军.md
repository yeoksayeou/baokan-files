    Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd, New York dispatch: Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi said in a televised interview on December 2nd that the United Nations Emergency Force should only be stationed in Egypt "for as short a period as possible." Once the British and French troops withdraw, the United Nations Emergency Force will have nothing to do in the Suez Canal area.
    Fawzi spoke about the Suez Canal issue, saying: Ships of all countries can use the canal at any time without discrimination. Egypt is very willing to fully cooperate with the countries using the canal and does not want to exploit anyone. He said: "However, cooperating with the United Nations Emergency Force does not mean expecting it to participate in the management and operation of the canal."
    Fawzi also pointed out that after the withdrawal of British and French troops, the United Nations forces should also be stationed near the Egyptian-Israeli demarcation line for a period of time. However, the UN forces "are not stationed there to solve the Palestinian issue or any other issues."
    Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd, TASS dispatch from Cairo: According to the Middle East News Agency, the Sudanese government held an emergency meeting in Khartoum to discuss the situation in the Near East.
    Minister of State Amin Tum said that the Sudanese government fully supports Egypt's demand that the aggressive forces withdraw from its territory.
    The Middle East News Agency also reported that the Sudanese Foreign Ministry has asked the British Embassy in Sudan to stop publishing and distributing the embassy's daily bulletin because the bulletin contains anti-Egyptian propaganda.
    Sudanese newspapers have refused to use the materials distributed by the British Embassy.

    法齐强调联合国部队只能暂驻埃及
　　苏丹政府支持埃及要求侵略者撤军
    新华社3日讯　纽约消息：埃及外交部长法齐12月2日在电视谈话中说，联合国紧急部队只能在“尽可能短的时期内”暂驻在埃及。一俟英法军队撤出，联合国紧急部队在苏伊士运河区就没有什么工作了。
    法齐就此谈到苏伊士运河问题说：一切国家的船只随时都可以无差别地使用这条运河，埃及很想同使用运河的国家充分合作，而不想剥削任何人。他说：“但是同联合国紧急部队进行合作并不等于指望它参加管理和经营这条运河。”
    法齐还指出，在英法军队撤退后，联合部队还应该在埃及—以色列分界线附近驻扎一个时期。但是，联合国军队“驻在那里并不是要解决巴勒斯坦问题或任何其他问题”。
    新华社3日讯　塔斯社开罗3日讯：据中东通讯社报道，苏丹政府在喀土穆举行了非常会议，讨论中近东局势。
    国务部长阿明·图姆说，苏丹政府完全支持埃及要侵略军队撤出它的领土的要求。
    中东通讯社还报道，苏丹外交部已经要求英国驻苏丹大使馆停止出版和发行大使馆的每日公报，因为公报中有反埃及的宣传。
    苏丹报纸拒绝利用英国大使馆所散发的材料。
