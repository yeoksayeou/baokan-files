Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 17th. Winter agricultural capital construction in Shanxi Province has recently turned active after reversing a slackening trend. Currently, more than 440,000 people throughout the province are participating in soil and water conservation projects. Among them, the more than 2,000 agricultural cooperatives in the Yanbei area, which are progressing the fastest, can control more than 210,000 mu of soil erosion area by adopting methods such as afforestation. In terms of water conservancy construction, only 57 counties such as Jieyu and Gaoping have completed more than 360 various irrigation projects, and there are still more than 380 canal and reservoir projects under intense construction.

Since the beginning of autumn this year, the progress of agricultural capital construction in Shanxi Province has been very slow, and the farmers' enthusiasm is insufficient. According to recent investigations by relevant units, the reason for this phenomenon is mainly that some leading cadres, after criticizing certain blind and rash deviations in agricultural capital construction last winter and this spring, have developed an ideological tendency to neglect long-term capital construction, believing that everything done in the past was wrong, and therefore adopted a passive and retreating attitude towards this winter's agricultural capital construction. In addition, some disaster-stricken and reduced-production areas only focused on developing sideline production that earned quick money, neglecting and relaxing agricultural capital construction. The leading organs at all levels conducted investigations and studies on the above situation in late October and took measures accordingly. After criticizing the tendency of leading cadres to neglect long-term agricultural capital construction in their thinking and the “gust of wind” and other wavering phenomena in their practices, the Changzhi Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China organized a large number of cadres to go to the countryside to strengthen leadership over winter production. Each county also, based on the experience and lessons learned from poor quality and many accidents caused by blindly engaging in capital construction last year, vigorously helped agricultural cooperatives formulate and revise winter production plans. The leading organs in the Yanbei area, according to local conditions and agricultural seasons, timely proposed different guidelines and priorities, and decided that the focus of the area before freezing is to grasp major construction projects; after freezing, shift to focusing on preparing for next year's production and developing sideline production, combined with tidying up scattered soil and water conservation and water conservancy construction projects; and required all localities to reasonably arrange labor according to this guideline to ensure that preparation for next year's production, agricultural capital construction, and sideline production are not delayed. After the masses were generally mobilized in this area, they also timely established and improved the basic construction leading institutions, strengthened technical guidance, and transferred more than 3,000 experienced grass-roots technical cadres to participate in technical guidance work. Yanggao County also improved its leadership over basic construction, dividing the county into ten areas according to regional characteristics, establishing command posts, and having ten groups composed of leading cadres such as the secretary of the county party committee and the county head go to ten points to take charge of command to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 17th. More than 17,000 cadres from leadership organs at the county level and above in Shandong Province have been successively transferred to the countryside to help rural grass-roots organizations and agricultural cooperatives do a good job in further consolidating agricultural cooperatives and mobilizing farmers to carry out winter production. Some areas have gained preliminary experience in their work.

The large-scale dispatch of cadres to the countryside in Shandong Province this time began after conveying and studying the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The task of going to the countryside is to earnestly help agricultural cooperatives solve various problems and do a good job in winter production. Organizations and cadres at all levels have shown a high degree of awareness and enthusiasm for this trip to help. Many regions and agencies quickly transferred a large number of high-quality cadres to the countryside. Among the cadres from provincial-level agencies who went to the countryside were several secretaries of the provincial party committee, vice governors, ministers, and directors. The past phenomenon of shouting that the work of the agencies was busy and that it was impossible to transfer people was gone. Many cadres in various places voluntarily requested to go to the countryside and expressed their determination to rely on the masses to do a good job before returning to their original agencies.

The cadres who went to the countryside in various places underwent training before departure. The party and government leaders explained to them the various policies related to the work, explained the working methods, and emphasized to them that they must adhere to the spirit of seeking truth from facts and the style of hard work and thoroughness.

At present, the areas where cadres went to the countryside earlier and the pilot projects in various places have gained preliminary experience on how to help agricultural cooperatives do a good job in production and rectification work. These experiences can be summarized as follows: First, it is necessary to rely on the party and Youth League branches, rely on the cadres and activists of the cooperatives, rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, implement the policy of democratic management of cooperatives, and fully mobilize the broad masses of members to carry out production and rectification work. The cadres sent down from above are mainly for guidance and cannot do everything for them. Second, what problems need to be solved in the rectification of the cooperatives must be decided according to the specific conditions of each cooperative and cannot be formalized. It is necessary to solve the problems within the cooperative in accordance with the spirit of the cooperative's charter and the opinions of the masses. Before the rectification of the cooperatives, it is necessary to conduct in-depth investigations and visits among the members of the cooperatives and start by solving the most pressing problems of the members of the cooperatives. Third, it is necessary to strengthen political and ideological work and summarize achievements. Laiyang area adopted the method of guiding members to use the method of recalling and comparing to calculate the increase in production, the change in living conditions, and the prospects for running the society well, which had a good effect. Fourth, the party committees at all levels must strengthen leadership and implement the policy of "adapting to local conditions and timely guidance." In terms of working methods, the method of "grasping both ends and bringing the middle" should be adopted, that is, sending some cadres to help the first-class cooperatives and key cooperatives to carry out rectification work, so as to gain experience to guide the general; at the same time, sending more cadres to the cooperatives with more problems to help them rectify and improve.

### 山西冬季农田水利建设开始活跃  山东大批干部下乡帮助冬季生产和整社工作

    山西冬季农田水利建设开始活跃
    山东大批干部下乡帮助冬季生产和整社工作
    新华社太原17日电　山西省冬季农业基本建设在扭转了松劲现象后，最近开始转向活跃。目前全省已经有四十四万多人参加了水土保持工程建设，其中进展最快的雁北地区的两千多个农业社，采取植树造林等办法就可以控制二十一万多亩水土流失面积。水利建设方面仅解虞、高平等五十七个县已完成各种灌溉工程三百六十多处，现在还有三百八十多处渠道、水库等工程正在紧张施工。
    今年入秋以来，山西省农业基本建设工作进展得很缓慢，农民劲头不足。据最近有关单位调查，发生这种现象的原因，主要是有些领导干部在批判了去冬今春农业基本建设中某些盲目冒进偏向以后，产生了一种忽视长期基本建设的思想倾向，认为过去搞的全错了，因而对今年冬季的农业基本建设采取了消极退缩的态度。另外一部分遭灾减产的地区，只顾搞赚现钱的副业生产，忽视和放松了农业基本建设。各级领导机关在10月下旬对上述情况做了调查研究，并且分别采取了措施。中共长治地委在批判了领导干部思想上忽视农业长期基本建设的倾向和作法上的“一阵风”等左右摇摆现象后，组织了大批干部下乡，加强对冬季生产的领导，各县还根据去年盲目搞基本建设带来质量差、事故多的经验教训，大力帮助农业社制定和修订冬季生产计划。雁北地区领导机关根据各地条件和农事季节，适时地提出不同的方针和重点，决定这个地区在结冻前的重点是抓主要建设工程；封冻以后转向以做好明年生产准备和发展副业生产为主，结合收拾零星水土保持和水利建设工程；并且要求各地根据这一方针，合理安排劳力，做到使明年生产准备、农业基本建设和副业生产都不误。这个地区在群众普遍发动起来以后，还及时建立与健全了基本建设领导机构，加强了技术指导，抽调了三千多名有经验的基层技术干部参加技术指导工作。阳高县还改进了对基本建设的领导，全县按地区特点分十片，建立了指挥所，由中共县委书记、县长等领导干部组成十个小组，分赴十个点包干负责指挥到底。
    新华社济南17日电　山东省县以上各级领导机关已经先后抽调一万七千多名干部下乡，帮助农村基层组织和农业社做好进一步巩固农业社，发动农民开展冬季生产的工作。部分地区在工作中已经取得了初步的经验。
    山东省这次大批干部下乡，是在传达和学习了中共第八次全国代表大会和中共八届二中全会的精神以后开始的。下乡的任务是切切实实地帮助农业社把各种问题解决好，把冬季生产搞好。各级组织和干部对这次下乡帮助工作，表现了高度的自觉和热情。许多地区和机关很快就抽调出数量又多、质量又好的干部下乡。省级机关下乡的干部中，就有中共省委书记、副省长、部长和厅长等多人。过去那种叫喊机关工作忙、抽调不动的现象没有了。各地都有很多干部自动要求下乡，并且表示了依靠群众把工作搞好以后才回到原机关的决心。
    各地下乡的干部在出发之前都经过了训练，由党、政负责人向他们讲解了和工作有关的各项政策，交代了工作方法，并且向他们强调指出，必须坚持实事求是的精神和艰苦深入的作风。
    目前，干部下乡较早的地区和各地的试点，对于如何帮助农业社搞好生产整社工作，已经取得初步的经验。这些经验归纳起来有以下几点：第一，必须依靠党的和团的支部，依靠社的干部和积极分子，依靠贫农和下中农，贯彻民主办社的方针，充分发动广大社员进行生产整社工作。从上面派下去的干部主要是进行辅导，不能包办代替。第二，整社要解决什么问题，必须按照各社的具体情况来决定，不能公式化。必须根据社章的精神和群众的意见，解决社内的问题。在整社前要深入社员中调查访问，从解决社员群众当前最迫切的问题入手。第三，必须加强政治思想工作，总结成绩。莱阳地区采取引导社员用回忆对比的方法，算增产账、生活变化账和办好社的前途账，效果良好。第四，中共各级党委必须加强领导，贯彻“因地制宜、及时指导”的方针。在工作方法上，应该采取“抓两头、带中间”的办法，即派一部分干部帮助一类社和重点社进行整顿工作，以便取得经验指导一般；同时派更多的干部到问题较多的社去，帮助他们整顿提高。
