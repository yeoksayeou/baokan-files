Today, we are here to commemorate three outstanding scientists: Benjamin Franklin, Pierre Curie, and Marie Curie.

Benjamin Franklin was one of the founders of the study of electricity. He captured lightning from the sky, first explained the essence of electrical phenomena, and invented the lightning rod.

Pierre Curie and Marie Curie were the pioneers of the atomic age. They were the first to discover the radioactive elements radium and polonium, and elucidated many important properties of radioactive materials and the basic effects of radiation.

The twentieth century is the century of electricity and the century of atomic energy. The utilization of electrical energy has promoted a great revolution in industrial technology and a great development of social productivity. The utilization of atomic energy will further promote new and greater changes in industrial technology, opening up infinitely beautiful prospects for human life. The three great scientists we commemorate today have made indelible contributions to the realization of these changes.

The scientific contributions of these three great scientists are quite extensive. In addition to electricity, Franklin also contributed to thermotics and optics, and also studied individual problems in meteorology, geology, oceanography, acoustics, and sunspots. He first pointed out that "man is a tool-using animal" and that "the standard of value is labor," which was highly praised by Marx. Curie's discovery of the piezoelectric effect of crystals, Curie's law on the magnetism of matter, and the "principle of symmetry" in physical phenomena are all of significant scientific value.

The three of them were not only great scientists but also great humanitarians. They loved the people. In order to save the American people from the oppression of colonialism, Franklin bravely participated in the struggle for American independence and became one of the outstanding leaders of this struggle. He participated in the drafting of the "Declaration of Independence" and the "American Constitution." He opposed slavery, organized anti-slavery associations, and actively participated in the struggle to liberate black slaves. He was determined to contribute all his scientific achievements to the people. In 1742, he invented a stove that could make the room warmer and save fuel. He refused the patent rights that others wanted to give him and quickly made his invention public. After discovering radium, the Curies, in order to make radium serve the people and treat diseases as soon as possible, immediately disclosed the method of extracting radium and refused to apply for patent rights. The Curies consistently advocated the peaceful use of atomic energy. They foresaw that "in the hands of criminals, radium can become a dangerous thing." They firmly declared, "I am among those who hope that mankind will obtain happiness rather than misfortune from new inventions." During World War I, Madame Curie, in order to save the wounded soldiers, installed X-ray equipment on cars and went to the battlefield to diagnose and treat the wounded soldiers in turn, saving the lives of a large number of wounded soldiers. This spirit of loving the people, loyally serving the people, and lofty moral character cannot but arouse our infinite admiration.

In order to commemorate these three great scientists and noble humanitarians, our new China's scientific workers must learn from them and earnestly serve the people. We must vigorously develop our country's scientific undertakings and make our country's science approach or catch up with the world's advanced level as soon as possible. We must strive to realize the industrialization and electrification of the motherland, and strive to widely and peacefully utilize atomic energy in our country. We must defend science, defend peace, and open up new avenues for benefiting mankind from science.

Due to long-term feudalistic constraints and nearly a century of colonialist aggression, modern science in our country is undoubtedly backward. But we have the confidence to quickly change this backward situation. Franklin did not have the opportunity to receive a good school education in his life. Busy social activities occupied a lot of his time. The Americas where he was located were also far away from the advanced scientific centers of the world at that time. However, starting from the age of forty-one, he reached the highest level of that era in electricity in just seven years. The scientific research work of the Curies did not receive the support of the French government at that time, the laboratory conditions were extremely poor, and the teaching work was very heavy, but they still completed the very arduous feat of discovering radium and polonium. Today, the era and environment we are in are incomparable to the era and environment in which the three great scientists were. Our country and people strongly support scientific undertakings and are working hard to create various excellent conditions for scientific work. International advanced scientists are giving us great and selfless help in developing China's scientific undertakings. Therefore, if our Chinese scientific workers can take the three great scientists we commemorate today as examples, learn from their arduous and unyielding spirit, and overcome all possible difficulties in scientific research with the greatest effort and patience, we can be fully confident that by the end of the Third Five-Year Plan construction, the most urgently needed scientific and technological departments in our country will approach the world's advanced level.

To rapidly develop our country's scientific undertakings, train scientific cadres, and improve the people's cultural level is very important. In this regard, Franklin and the Curies are also good examples for us to learn from. Due to Franklin's initiative, the first public library and the University of Pennsylvania were established in the United States. Franklin attached great importance to the popularization of electrical knowledge, and he was recognized as an outstanding enlightener of the eighteenth century. The Curies also attached great importance to the training of scientific cadres. The outstanding scientists Langevin and the Joliot-Curies were all trained by them. After Pierre Curie's death, more than five hundred papers on radioactivity research were completed in the laboratory led by Marie Curie, and many scientists were cultivated, forming a progressive scientific center for atomic energy research. In order to commemorate them, our Chinese scientific workers must also make due contributions to the training of scientific cadres and the popularization of scientific knowledge.

The science of New China is to serve the people. Today, in commemorating the great scientific pioneers—Franklin and the Curies—we must contribute all scientific achievements to the people, resolutely oppose colonialism, oppose war, and oppose the use of atomic weapons and thermonuclear weapons. We must wage an unremitting struggle to defend world peace.

To develop science and defend peace, it is necessary to strengthen the ties and cooperation between scientific workers around the world. Franklin's understanding of the nature of electricity was once supported by the Russian scientists Lomonosov and Richmann. Richmann even sacrificed his precious life in order to conduct experiments to capture lightning in the atmosphere. The American people also aided Madame Curie with one gram of radium as an experimental material in order to support her scientific work. Today, in commemorating the great scientific pioneers—Franklin and the Curies—we are very happy that foreign scientists from afar are participating in our meeting. We warmly welcome them and hope that they will convey our wishes to scientists and people around the world. Our Chinese scientific workers must work with scientists and peace-loving people from all countries in the world to strive to eliminate all artificial barriers, promote international scientific and cultural exchanges, develop friendly cooperation between the people and scientific workers of all countries, and make peace forever overcome war.

Glory forever belongs to science and scientists who serve the happiness of mankind!

    富兰克林、居里夫妇纪念会开幕词
    郭沫若
    今天我们在这里纪念三位杰出的科学家。一位是本杰明·富兰克林，另外两位是皮埃尔·居里和玛丽·居里。
    本杰明·富兰克林是电学的奠基人之一。他从天空中攫取了闪电，第一次阐明了电现象的本质，发明了避雷针。
    皮埃尔·居里和玛丽·居里夫妇是原子能时代的开创者。他们最先发现了放射性的新元素镭和钋，阐明了放射性物质的多种重要性质和放射的各种基本效应。
    二十世纪，是电的世纪、是原子能的世纪，电能的利用，促成了工业技术的大革命，促进了社会生产力的大发展。原子能的利用，必将更进一步促使工业技术发生新的更为巨大的变革，为人类生活开辟无限美好的远景。这些变革之所以能够实现，我们今天所纪念的三位伟大的科学家，都有着不可磨灭的功绩。
    这三位伟大的科学家在科学上的贡献，是相当广泛的。富兰克林在电学之外，对热学、光学也有所贡献，对气象、地质、海洋、声学和日中黑斑等方面的个别问题也都做过研究。他首先指出了“人是使用工具的动物”，“价值的标准是劳动”，从而得到了马克思的很高的推崇。居里所发现的晶体的压电效应，关于物质磁性的居里定律，关于物理现象中的“对称原理”等，都具有重要的科学价值。
    他们三位不仅是伟大的科学家，而同时是伟大的人道主义者。他们热爱人民。为了使美国人民免受殖民主义者的压迫，富兰克林勇敢地参加了争取美国独立的斗争，成为这个斗争的杰出的领导人之一。他参加了“独立宣言”和“美国宪法”的起草。他反对奴隶制度，组织了反奴隶制度协会，积极地参加了解放黑奴的斗争。他决意将一切科学成果贡献给人民。1742年，他发明了能使室中更温暖而又节省燃料的火炉，他拒绝了别人要送给他的专利权，很快地公开了他的发明。居里夫妇在发现镭后，他们为了要使镭尽快地服务于人民，为人民医治疾病，因此，也立即公开了提取镭的方法，拒绝申请专利权。居里夫妇一贯主张原子能的和平利用。他们预计到“在罪犯们手中，镭可以成为危险的东西。”他们坚定地声称“我是在希望人类将要从新发明中取得幸福，而不是取得祸患的那些人中间的。”第一次世界大战期间，居里夫人为了救护伤兵，将X射线设备装置在汽车上，到战场上轮回地诊疗伤兵，挽救了大批伤兵的生命。这种热爱人民，忠诚地为人民服务的精神和崇高的道德品质，不能不引起我们无限的崇敬。
    为了纪念这三位伟大的科学家和崇高的人道主义者，我们新中国的科学工作者一定要学习他们认真地为人民服务。我们要大力发展我国的科学事业，尽快地使我国的科学接近或赶上世界先进水平。我们要为实现祖国的工业化、电气化而努力，为在我国广泛地和平利用原子能而努力。我们要保卫科学、保卫和平，从科学上开辟出造福于人类的新途径。
    由于长期的封建主义束缚和近百年的殖民主义侵略，我国现代的科学，无疑地是落后了。但是我们有信心迅速改变这种落后状况。富兰克林生平并没有机会受到很好的学校教育。繁忙的社会活动占据了他大量的时间。他所在的美洲和当时世界的先进科学中心也相距很远。但是，他从四十一岁开始，仅仅以七年的时间，就在电学上达到了那个时代的最高水平。居里夫妇的科学研究工作得不到当时法国政府的支持，实验室条件极差，教学工作又很繁重，但是他们仍然完成了十分艰巨的发现镭和钋的丰功伟绩。今天我们所处的时代和环境，同三位伟大的科学家所处的时代和环境是不可同日而语的。我们的国家和人民大力支持科学事业，正在努力地为科学工作创造各种优良的条件。国际的先进科学家们在发展中国的科学事业上更给予我们以伟大无私的帮助。因此，我们中国科学工作者如果能以我们今天所纪念的三位伟大科学家为榜样，学习他们的坚苦卓绝的精神，用最大的努力和耐心克服在科学研究中可能有的一切困难，我们就能够有充分的把握，在第三个五年计划建设的末期，使我国最急需的科学和技术部门，接近世界先进水平。
    要迅速发展我国的科学事业，培养科学干部，提高人民文化水平，是十分重要的。在这一方面，富兰克林和居里夫妇也是我们学习的良好榜样。由于富兰克林的发起，在美国建立了第一个公共图书馆，建立了宾夕法尼亚学院。富兰克林十分重视电学知识的普及，他被公认为十八世纪的卓越的启蒙者。居里夫妇也十分重视科学干部的培养，杰出的科学家郎之万、约里奥·居里夫妇都是他们培养出来的。皮埃尔·居里逝世后，在玛丽·居里领导的实验室中，完成了五百篇以上的关于放射性研究的论文，培育出了许多的科学家，形成了一个有关原子能研究的进步科学中心。为了纪念他们，我们中国科学工作者，也一定要在培养科学干部、普及科学知识上做出应有的贡献。
    新中国的科学是为人民服务的。在纪念伟大的科学先进——富兰克林和居里夫妇的今天，我们一定要将一切科学成果贡献于人民，坚决地反对殖民主义，反对战争，反对使用原子武器和热核子武器。我们一定要为保卫世界和平进行坚持不懈的斗争。
    要发展科学，保卫和平，需要加强世界科学工作者的联系和合作。富兰克林对于电的本质的见解，就曾经得到俄国科学家罗蒙诺索夫、黎黑曼的支持。黎黑曼为了进行掇取大气中闪电的实验，还牺牲了他宝贵的生命。美国的人民，为了支持居里夫人的科学工作，也曾援助她一克镭，作为实验的材料。在纪念伟大的科学先进——富兰克林和居里夫妇的今天，我们十分高兴，有来自远方的外国科学家参加我们这个会议，我们热烈地表示欢迎，并希望他们把我们的愿望，转达给世界各国的科学家和人民。我们中国科学工作者一定要和世界各国的科学家和爱好和平的人民一道，努力撤消一切人为的壁障，促进国际间科学文化的交流，发展各国人民和科学工作者之间的友好合作，使和平永远克服战争。
    光荣永远属于为人类幸福服务的科学和科学家！
