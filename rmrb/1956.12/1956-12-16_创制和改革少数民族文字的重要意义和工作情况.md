    The Important Significance and Work Situation of Creating and Reforming Minority Languages
    Fu Maoji, Deputy Director of the Institute of Nationalities Languages, Chinese Academy of Sciences

    Although the population of ethnic minorities in our country accounts for only 6% of the total national population, the areas they inhabit account for about 60% of the total area of the country. Moreover, a large part of these areas are rich in industrial resources or are located on the national defense line. Therefore, helping ethnic minorities develop their economy and culture is of great significance to our country's economic construction and national defense construction. Over the past seven years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the Party and the government, all ethnic minorities have actively participated in the socialist construction and socialist transformation of the motherland together with the Han people, and have achieved great results. However, because many ethnic minorities do not have written languages or their written languages are imperfect, their work progress has been limited to a certain extent, and they have encountered many difficulties.

    This difficulty is first manifested in the social reform and democratic reform carried out in ethnic minority areas. For example, in many fraternal ethnic groups' agricultural producers' cooperatives, it is difficult to find literate office workers. Some cooperatives share one accountant, and some villages recruit literate Han men from distant villages to be live-in sons-in-law so that they can work as accountants in their cooperatives. In agricultural producers' cooperatives where accountants cannot be found, many primitive methods of aiding memory are used quite commonly. Recently, I heard Miao representatives at a meeting in Guiyang reflect that the lack of written language has brought many difficulties to socialist transformation. For example, some agricultural producers' cooperatives use methods such as counting beans, carving wood, and drawing lines on the wall to record work points, sometimes mistaking 1.5 work points for 10.5 work points, and sometimes mistaking 15 work points for 105 work points. Some cooperative members' families cannot reconcile their accounts, and they cannot reconcile their accounts with the accountant. A Buyi representative said: "Because there is no written language, agricultural cooperatives have to draw circles, carve lines, or use corn kernels and beans of various colors to record work and accounts. After a long time, when there are too many symbols, it becomes unclear; or the corn and beans are eaten by mice, making it impossible to count, which will cause disputes and disunity among the cooperative members." The difficulties caused by the lack of written language are not limited to the recording of work points and accounts in cooperatives, but also affect the correct publicity of policies and the improvement of production technology. For example, in some Miao areas of the Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture in Guizhou Province, "unified purchase and sale" was once misunderstood as "selling to buy," and in some Buyi areas of the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, the "row planting" of wheat was once misunderstood as "spreading like stars in the sky." From the above situations, it is not difficult for us to appreciate the pain of fraternal ethnic groups without written languages and the difficulties brought to various tasks.

    The difficulty of not having a written language is also reflected in national education. Without a written language, all subjects in ethnic schools can only be taught using Chinese textbooks. In the past seven years, this method has only worked relatively well in individual fraternal ethnic areas that are familiar with Chinese. However, it is difficult for the vast majority of fraternal ethnic areas that do not speak Chinese or only speak a little Chinese. Elementary school students learn difficult Chinese characters that are divorced from their own language as soon as they enter school, which is difficult for both teachers and students. Although some teachers try to learn the local ethnic language and use the local ethnic language to explain Chinese textbooks, and those who have not learned the local ethnic language also ask translators to interpret for them, the effect is still not very good. The grades of Han students in the same class are often much higher than those of fraternal ethnic students. When students' interest in learning declines and parents see that the learning effect is very low, many ethnic elementary school students cannot attend classes according to the prescribed time, and some students attend for a period of time and then stop for a period of time, which further increases the difficulty of teaching. The difficulty in learning not only appears in elementary schools, but also in middle schools. Many ethnic minority high school graduates still mix vocabulary and grammar from their own language when writing articles in Chinese. This is not only the case for ethnic groups without written languages, but also for ethnic groups with written languages that cannot adapt to the requirements of modern society. The Uygur people in Xinjiang already have a written language with a long history, and there are also ethnic language textbooks in ethnic schools. However, because there are many additional symbols above and below the letters, the writing of many characters is not uniform, and two letters each express two completely different vowel phonemes, which also adds many difficulties to teaching and use. Therefore, the Uygur language textbooks compiled by the cadre schools in the autonomous region have had to add two letters themselves to improve language teaching efficiency. But this can only solve local difficulties. The current decision of the Uygur people to carry out a thorough reform of their written language is a fundamental solution to the problem.

    The difficulty of not having a written language is also reflected in industrial construction. To develop all ethnic minorities into advanced ethnic groups, another fundamental key is to develop modern industry in ethnic minority areas where conditions permit, and to train their own working class and their own scientific and technical cadres and enterprise management cadres. To do these things, it is necessary to universally improve their political and cultural level, which is not only a great difficulty for ethnic groups without written languages, but also for ethnic groups with written languages that are not perfect.

    Some comrades believe that wouldn't it be better if all fraternal ethnic groups without written languages learned Chinese, which is widely used and does not require creating another written language? In fact, the method of using Chinese to replace the creation of their own ethnic written language is not feasible. Written language is the written form of language, and Chinese characters cannot express the languages of ethnic minorities. In the past, the Zhuang, Buyi, Dong, Shui, and Yao peoples all used Chinese characters and variants of Chinese characters to express their own languages, but none of them succeeded. If they learn Chinese completely, they need to learn Chinese at the same time, and the vast majority of fraternal ethnic groups with independent languages do not speak Chinese. Chinese characters are already very complicated for the Han people, and it is even more difficult for people from fraternal ethnic groups who do not understand Chinese to learn them. This is from the perspective of existing language foundation, that is, from the perspective of education, it is not appropriate not to help fraternal ethnic groups create their own written languages. Any member of an ethnic group, unless they grow up in another ethnic area, first learns their native language, which is the most familiar and combined with their own thinking. For them, the easiest to learn and the written language that they will inevitably love is the written language that represents their native language, which is the "own written language" that they urgently demand. After mastering their own written language, because they have obtained basic knowledge and experience in learning language from learning their own written language, and recognize the characteristics of their own language and written language, it is easier to learn Chinese. Therefore, currently creating and reforming written languages for fraternal ethnic groups is not only necessary for the development of the motherland's economic construction and cultural construction, but also greatly helps fraternal ethnic groups learn Chinese. This will not only not weaken the learning of Chinese, but will instead increase the interest in learning Chinese and increase the convenience of learning Chinese.

    The Chinese Communist Party and our government have long pointed out the importance of creating and reforming written languages for ethnic minorities to national construction, and have repeatedly emphasized and guaranteed the freedom of all ethnic minorities to develop their own languages and written languages. In 1951 and 1954, the former Government Administration Council made decisions and instructions to help ethnic minorities create and enrich written languages; this work was also included in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy; not long ago, Comrades Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai also put forward the task of helping ethnic minorities create and reform written languages in their reports to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The Chinese Academy of Sciences, in accordance with the instructions of the Party and the government, organized some small-scale ethnic minority language survey teams to work in ethnic areas. However, the manpower was too small and the work was too slow to meet the needs of the country and the urgent demands of fraternal ethnic groups. Since February of this year, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has cooperated with the Central Institute for Nationalities, the Southwest Institute for Nationalities, and the Central South Institute for Nationalities to run language survey training classes for about 500 people in Beijing and Chengdu respectively, and has jointly formed seven ethnic minority language survey teams of about 700 people with relevant institutions. Since April of this year, these seven work teams have gone to ethnic minority areas in provinces such as Guangxi, Guangdong, Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Qinghai, Gansu, Heilongjiang, and the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to conduct surveys and research on modern dialects and original languages and written languages. Each work team only puts forward the results of the investigation and research. As for what kind of written language should be created for ethnic groups without written languages or which existing written language should be adopted, and how ethnic groups with original written languages should develop their existing written languages, or to what extent they should reform their existing written languages, are all determined and resolved by the ethnic groups themselves.

    At present, some ethnic minorities already have their own language experts, while some ethnic groups do not. In order to enhance the strength of language experts of all ethnic groups and conduct more in-depth language scientific research, each work team has some intellectuals from their own ethnic group participating in the investigation and research work. The Central Institute for Nationalities and local institutes for nationalities, language schools, and some cadre schools are also working hard to train ethnic language cadres. The Institute of Nationalities Languages of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is also increasing the number of research cadres from all ethnic groups in order to conduct research on ethnic languages together with Han cadres. There are now thousands of young people from Han and fraternal ethnic groups studying in schools and training in language research institutions and work teams. It can be said that a new generation of ethnic language experts is gradually growing up. In order to better lead the development of language work, the relevant provinces and ethnic autonomous organs have also gradually strengthened and newly established some language work guidance institutions or research institutions. Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Guizhou Province, Sichuan Province, Yunnan Province, Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Guangdong Province, and the Daur ethnic group in Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, and Xinjiang have all established such specialized institutions. These specialized institutions have played a great role in guiding and promoting ethnic language work. Other regions are also preparing to establish such institutions. The Academy of Sciences and institutions that train language cadres should pay attention to helping and strengthening the scientific strength of these institutions.

    Since the National Language Scientific Discussion Conference was held in Beijing at the end of last year, various regions have successively held such meetings that combine scientific research and specific work this year. In May, the Mongolian Language Scientific Discussion Conference was held in Hohhot. The conference unanimously supported the decision of the People's Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to promote the new Mongolian script. The Mongolian people in our country originally used two scripts, one used in the Mongolian areas of Xinjiang and the other used in other Mongolian areas. After studying the reports of the Fifth Work Team for Language Survey of Ethnic Minorities and the Soviet Mongolian language expert Todaeva, the representatives believed that there was no need to use two scripts, and all unanimously agreed to use the new Mongolian script. In this way, the Mongolian people in our country will gradually transition from using two old Mongolian scripts to using a unified and perfect new Mongolian script in the near future. The meeting also discussed the draft of creating a Daur script and exchanged views on the survey and research work of the Dongxiang, Tu, and Bonan languages. In addition, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region also held a language scientific discussion conference in Urumqi in August. Since the languages of most ethnic minorities in Xinjiang are closely related to the languages of ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, the conference also invited representatives from the scientific, educational, and publishing circles of Almaty, Kazakh Republic, Soviet Union, to participate in the conference. There are nine ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region that have independent languages and language problems. The principles for solving the language problems of these nine ethnic groups were discussed and agreed upon at this conference. The Uygur, Kazakh, Kirgiz, Uzbek, and Tatar ethnic groups have all decided to gradually change the scripts based on the Arabic alphabet to scripts based on the Russian alphabet. The Xibe ethnic group decided to change the script based on the Manchu alphabet to a script based on the Russian alphabet. The Xinjiang Daur ethnic group once created a script based on the Manchu alphabet in the past, and now it has decided to jointly formulate a new script with the Daur ethnic group in Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang. The language of the Tajik ethnic group still needs to be further investigated and compared with the standard language of the Tajik ethnic group in the Soviet Union in order to decide whether to adopt the Soviet Tajik script or create a new script on its own. When studying the principles of these ethnic language works, the language materials and the specific conditions of each ethnic group were carefully studied. For example, languages belonging to the same Turkic language family and using the Russian alphabet as the basis for their alphabets still have some differences in specific practices. The Uzbek and Tatar ethnic groups have small populations in our country, and they are mostly scattered. Their languages are the same as the languages of the same names in the Soviet Union, so it was decided to adopt the Soviet Uzbek and Tatar languages. The Kazakh and Kirgiz ethnic groups are relatively concentrated in our country and have established autonomous prefectures respectively. Their languages are basically the same as the languages of the same names in the Soviet Union, and it was also decided to adopt the same scripts as the Soviet languages for the time being. In addition, the Uygur ethnic group mainly resides in our country, and the Soviet Uygur alphabet and orthography do not closely fit our specific conditions. Therefore, although the Uygur ethnic group in our country also uses the Russian alphabet as the basis for its alphabet, it has designed a new Uygur script scheme separately.

    The above-mentioned new Mongolian, Uygur, Kazakh, Kirgiz, Uzbek, Tatar, Xibe, and Daur scripts are all based on the Russian alphabet, considering the close ties with related ethnic groups in the Mongolian People's Republic and the Soviet Union or the mutual ties between neighboring ethnic groups in our country. However, other ethnic minorities in southern China will create written languages based on the Latin alphabet due to their closer ties with written languages using the Latin alphabet or the people's familiarity with the form of the Latin alphabet. This requires planned research on the issue of achieving consistency in relevant letter forms. Therefore, the Institute of Nationalities Languages of the Chinese Academy of Sciences convened a discussion conference on the issue of letter forms of ethnic written languages in Guiyang in October of this year, specifically to discuss how to achieve consistency in letter forms of phonetic written languages based on the Latin alphabet. Everyone first agreed on the principle that all written languages based on the Latin alphabet should be as consistent as possible with each other and with the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme in terms of letter forms. Then, they compared the characteristics of various languages of the Zhuang-Dai, Miao-Yao, and Tibetan-Burman language families, formulated general letter tables for each language family according to the specific needs of various languages in each language family, and combined them to formulate a general letter table for the languages of various ethnic minorities in the Sino-Tibetan language family for reference by relevant ethnic minorities in designing the letters of their own languages. This will play a great role in mutual learning of languages and cultural exchange among ethnic groups. Following this letter form meeting, two ethnic language scientific discussion conferences were held in Guiyang. The representatives attending the scientific discussion conference on the Miao language and writing problem unanimously agreed to temporarily divide the Miao language into four major dialect areas: Eastern, Central, Western, and Northeastern Yunnan, and to first solve the language problems of these areas; other minority areas that differ greatly from these four dialects will be proposed for solving the language problems after further investigation and research. Because the differences between these four dialects are too great, the meeting agreed that the Eastern, Central, and Western dialect areas should each create a written language, and the Northeastern Yunnan dialect area should only reform its written language because it already has a written language. These four script schemes have been made as consistent as possible in terms of letter forms and spelling rules, but they also express their respective phonetic characteristics. In this way, it is convenient to learn from each other, enrich each other, and gradually tend towards unification. At the scientific discussion conference on the Buyi language and writing problem, the representatives carefully studied the internal language differences of the Buyi language and the similarities and differences between the Buyi language and the Zhuang language. Because the Buyi language and the Zhuang language have great commonality and are geographically connected, in order to facilitate the exchange and connection of cultural and educational work, everyone unanimously agreed to adopt the plan of establishing a writing alliance between the Buyi and Zhuang languages. The Buyi script is made as consistent as possible with the Zhuang script in terms of letter forms, spelling rules, and language norms, but it also takes into account the characteristics of the Buyi language. According to this plan, more than half of the Buyi words that are currently completely the same as the Zhuang script can be more than half of the vocabulary. In the future, both parties will jointly seek to approach each other, and naturally gradually expand the common components, so as to finally achieve the use of a common standard language. The scale of the above four language scientific discussion conferences was quite large. There were at least 138 representatives, and as many as 285, with up to 500 including observers. Some representatives learned to write their own opinions in their new written language during the process of discussing the writing scheme. For example, just after the closing of the scientific discussion conference on the Buyi language and writing problem, Buyi representative Pan Rufeng wrote a poem thanking Chairman Mao in his newly born written language, which contained the following paragraph:

    Respected Chairman Mao!
    You love and care for us like our parents,
    Helping us improve our material life,
    And helping us improve our cultural life.
    Created the Buyi script,
    Phonetic spelling with Latin letters,
    Alliance with the Zhuang script,
    It's really in harmony and in agreement.
    From today onwards,
    We must concentrate on studying hard,
    To better serve the people! This shows that the phonetic script is very easy to learn, and it also shows how enthusiastically fraternal ethnic groups welcome their own written languages.

    Up to now, eleven ethnic groups have designed their own written language schemes, including the Zhuang, Uygur, Yi (Sichuan), Miao, Buyi, Dai, Jingpo, Lisu, Lahu, Daur, and Xibe. Because there are two types of Dai scripts and four types of Miao scripts, there are a total of fifteen written language schemes. Most of them are drafts that have not yet been submitted to the central competent department for approval, and some schemes have not yet been discussed and determined by the ethnic groups at a meeting, but are only initial drafts. Five ethnic groups have not designed new written language schemes separately and have adopted existing written languages, including the Mongolian, Kazakh, Kirgiz, Uzbek, and Tatar. In summary, sixteen ethnic groups have now had preliminary plans for language creation or reform. We have the advanced linguistic scientific theory and work experience of the Soviet Union as a reference, our own linguistic scientific level is also constantly improving, our experience is also gradually enriching, a large number of ethnic language cadres are growing up, and all relevant units attach great importance to this work and are already cooperating with each other in a planned manner, which gives us full confidence to complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party and the government as soon as possible.

    创制和改革少数民族文字的重要意义和工作情况
    中国科学院少数民族语言研究所副所长　傅懋绩
    我国少数民族的人口，虽然仅占全国总人口的6％，但是他们居住的地区约占全国总面积的60％，而且这些地区的很大部分富有工业资源或处在国防线上；因此，帮助少数民族发展经济和文化，对我国经济建设和国防建设是具有极重大的意义的。中华人民共和国建立七年来，各少数民族在党和政府的领导下，都积极地同汉族一道参加了祖国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造，并且已经取得了很大的成绩。但是，由于许多少数民族没有文字或有文字而不完善，在工作进程中也就受到了一定的限制，遇到了不少的困难。
    这种困难首先表现在少数民族地区所进行的社会改革和民主改革方面。如在许多兄弟民族的农业生产合作社里，找不到懂文字的办事人员，有的几个社合用一个会计，有的村寨到很远的村寨去招懂文字的汉人做上门女婿，以便到自己的合作社里做会计。在找不到会计的农业生产合作社里，相当普遍地使用着许多原始的帮助记忆的办法。最近我在贵阳就听到开会的苗族代表反映，没有文字给社会主义改造带来了很多困难。如有的农业生产合作社里采用数豆粒儿、打木刻、在墙上划线条的办法记工，有时把1.5个工误为10.5个工，有时把15个工误为105个工。有的社员全家对不清账，同会计对账也对不清。布依族的代表说：“由于没有文字，农业社不得不画圆圈儿、刻线条儿或用包谷粒和各种颜色的豆子来记工记账，日子久了，符号一多，就弄不清楚；或包谷和豆子被老鼠吃了，无法清点，就要引起社员们的争吵和不团结。”没有文字所造成的困难还不限于合作社的记工记账，同时还影响到政策的正确宣传和生产技术的改进。如贵州省黔东南苗族侗族自治州的某些苗族地区，曾经把“统购统销”误解为“卖去买来”，黔南布依族苗族自治州的某些布依族地区，曾经把小麦的“条播”误解为“撒成满天星”。从上述这些情况中，我们不难体会到兄弟民族没有文字的痛苦和给各项工作带来的困难。
    没有文字的困难还表现在民族教育方面。没有文字，在民族学校里各门功课就只好使用汉文课本进行教学。在过去七年中，这种办法只在个别熟悉汉语的兄弟民族地区做得比较好，可是对于绝大部分不通汉语或略通汉语的兄弟民族地区就困难了。小学生一入学就学习和自己语言脱离的繁难的汉文，教师和学生都感到困难。有些教师虽然努力学习当地民族语言，用当地民族语言来解释汉文课本，没有学会当地民族语言的也请翻译代为解释，但这样做的效果还是不算好，同一班的汉族学生的成绩往往比兄弟民族学生高得多。在学生学习兴趣减退和家长看到学习效果很低的情况下，许多民族小学的学生不能按照规定的时间上课，有些学生上一个时期，又停一个时期，这就更增加了教学的困难。学习困难的情况不只出现在小学里，在中学里也同样地出现。许多少数民族的高级中学毕业生，用汉文写文章，还夹杂着本族语言的语汇和语法。不只没有文字的民族是这样，有文字而不能适应现代社会要求的民族，也有类似的情况。新疆维吾尔族已经有了历史悠久的文字，而且在民族学校里也有民族语文课本，但是由于字母上下附加符号很多，许多字的写法还不统一，有两个字母各自表达两个完全不同的元音音位，这也给教学和使用上增加了不少的困难，因此，在自治区干部学校所编的维吾尔语课本里，就不得不自己增加了两个字母，以提高语言教学效率。但这也只能解决局部的困难。现在维吾尔族决定进行彻底的文字改革，才是从根本上解决问题的办法。
    没有文字的困难也表现在工业建设方面。要使各少数民族发展成先进的民族，还有一个根本的关键，就是要在有条件的民族地区发展现代工业，培养他们自己的工人阶级和自己的科学技术干部、企业管理干部。而要做到这些事，就得普遍地提高他们的政治和文化水平，这不只对于没有文字的民族是一个大困难，对于有文字而不完善的民族也有困难。
    有些同志认为，没有文字的兄弟民族要是都学习汉文，用处广，又不需要另行创制文字，不是更好吗？事实上拿汉文来代替创制本民族文字的办法是行不通的。文字是语言的书写形式，汉字不可能表达少数民族的语言。过去僮族、布依族、侗族、水家族、瑶族都曾经使用过汉字和汉字的变体表达自己的语言，都没有成功。如果完全学习汉文，就需要同时学习汉语，而现在有独立语言的兄弟民族的绝大多数人不会说汉语。汉字对于汉人来说，已经很繁难，叫不懂汉语的兄弟民族的人学习起来，更是难上加难了。这是从现有语言基础上看，就是从教育学上看，不帮助兄弟民族创制自己的文字，也不适当。一个民族的任何一个成员，除非生长在别的民族地区，首先学习的最熟悉的并且和自己的思惟相结合的是自己的母语。对于他们来说，学起来最容易而且必然为他们所喜爱的一种文字，就是代表自己的母语的文字，也就是他们迫切要求着的“自己的文字”。在掌握了自己的文字以后，由于从自己文字的学习中得到了学习语文的基本知识和经验，认识到自己语言文字的特点，再学习汉语文就容易了，因此，目前为兄弟民族创制和改革文字，不只对于祖国经济建设和文化建设的发展是必要的，对于兄弟民族学习汉语文也有很大的帮助。这不只不会削弱汉语文的学习，反而会提高学习汉语文的兴趣，增加学习汉语文的便利。
    中国共产党和我国政府早就指出为少数民族创制和改革文字对于国家建设的重要意义，并一再强调和保障各少数民族发展自己的语言文字的自由。1951年和1954年前政务院做出了帮助少数民族创制和充实文字的决定和指示；在中华人民共和国宪法和发展国民经济的第一个五年计划里，也都列入了这一项工作；不久以前刘少奇同志和周恩来同志在向中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的报告里，也提出了帮助少数民族创制和改革文字的任务。中国科学院遵照党和政府的指示，早就组织了一些小规模的少数民族语言调查队，在民族地区工作。但是人力太少、工作太慢，不能满足国家的需要和兄弟民族的迫切要求。从今年2月起，中国科学院和中央民族学院、西南民族学院、中南民族学院合作，分别在北京和成都开办了约五百人的语言调查训练班，并和有关机构共同组成了约七百人的七个少数民族语言调查队。这七个工作队从今年4月起，分别到广西、广东、贵州、云南、四川、湖南、湖北、青海、甘肃、黑龙江等省的少数民族地区和西藏自治区、内蒙古自治区、新疆维吾尔自治区进行现代方言和原有语言文字的调查研究。各工作队只提出调查研究的结果，至于没有文字的民族究竟创制什么样的文字或采用何种现有的文字，原来有文字的民族究竟怎样发展现有的文字，或在什么程度上改革现有文字，都由本民族自己决定和解决。
    目前，有些少数民族已经有了自己的语文专家，有些民族还没有。为了增强各民族自己的语文专家的力量，更深入地进行语言科学研究工作，各工作队都有一些本民族的知识分子参加调查研究工作。中央民族学院和各地民族学院、语文学校和一部分干部学校，也都正在努力培养民族语文干部。中国科学院少数民族语言研究所也正在增加各民族的研究干部，以便和汉族干部共同进行民族语文的研究工作。现在有几千个汉族和兄弟民族的青年在学校里学习着，在语文研究机构和工作队里锻炼着，可以说新一代的民族语文专家已经逐渐地成长起来了。各有关省和民族自治机关，为了更好地领导语文工作的进行，也逐步加强和新建立了一些语文工作指导机构或研究机构。内蒙古自治区、新疆维吾尔自治区、贵州省、四川省、云南省、桂西僮族自治州、湘西苗族自治州、云南省的德宏傣族景颇族自治州、西双版纳傣族自治州、怒江傈僳族自治区、新疆维吾尔自治区克孜勒苏柯尔克孜族自治州，广东省海南黎族苗族自治州以及内蒙古、黑龙江和新疆的达呼尔族，都已经建立了这样的专门机构。这些专门机构在指导和推动民族语文工作方面，已经起了很大的作用。其他地区也正在筹备建立这样的机构。科学院和培养语文干部的机构应该注意帮助和加强这些机构的科学力量。
    自从去年年底在北京召开了民族语文科学讨论会以后，今年各地区也陆续召开了这种科学研究和具体工作相结合的会议。5月间在呼和浩特召开了蒙古族语言科学讨论会。会议一致拥护内蒙古自治区人民委员会关于推行新蒙文的决定。我国蒙古族原来使用两种文字，一种是在新疆的蒙古族地区使用，一种是在其他蒙古族地区使用。代表们在研究了少数民族语言调查第五工作队和苏联蒙古语专家托达叶娃的报告以后，认为没有必要使用两种文字，都一致愿意使用新蒙文。这样我国蒙古族不久就会由使用两种旧蒙文逐步过渡到使用统一完善的新蒙文了。会议还讨论了创制达呼尔文字的草案，对东乡、土族和保安等语言的调查研究工作，也交换了意见。此外，新疆维吾尔自治区8月间在乌鲁木齐也召开了语文科学讨论会。由于新疆大部分少数民族语言和苏联境内民族语言的关系很密切，这次会议还邀请苏联哈萨克共和国阿拉木图的科学教育出版界的代表参加了会议。新疆维吾尔自治区有独立语言而又有文字问题的有九个民族。解决这九个民族的文字问题的方针，都在这次会议上进行了讨论并取得了一致的意见。维吾尔族、哈萨克族、柯尔克孜族、乌孜别克族和塔塔尔族都决定逐渐把以阿拉伯字母为字母基础的文字，改为以俄文字母为字母基础的文字。锡伯族决定把以满文字母为字母基础的文字，改为以俄文字母为字母基础的文字。新疆达呼尔族过去曾经以满文字母为字母基础创制过一种文字，现在决定和内蒙古、黑龙江的达呼尔族共同制定一种新文字。塔吉克族的语言还需要继续深入调查并和苏联的塔吉克族标准语进行比较，以便决定是否采用苏联塔吉克文字，或自己另行创制一种文字。在研究这些民族文字工作的方针的时候，都仔细地研究了语言材料和各民族的具体情况。例如：同是突厥语族的语言，同是采用俄文字母做自己的字母基础，但具体做法还有些不同。乌孜别克族和塔塔尔族在我国人口很少，而且多是散居的，语言又和苏联同名称的语言相同，所以就决定采用苏联的乌孜别克文和塔塔尔文；哈萨克族和柯尔克孜族在我国比较聚居，而且分别建立了自治州，他们的语言和苏联名称相同的语言基本一致，也决定在目前采用苏联语言相同的文字。另外，维吾尔族主要居住在我国，苏联维吾尔文字母和正字法不大切合我国的具体情况，因此，我国维吾尔族虽然也以俄文字母为自己的字母基础，但是另行设计了新维吾尔文字方案。
    上述的新的蒙文、维吾尔文、哈萨克文、柯尔克孜文、乌孜别克文、塔塔尔文、锡伯文、达呼尔文，由于考虑到同蒙古人民共和国和苏联有关民族的密切联系或我国邻近民族相互间的联系，都是以俄文字母为字母基础的文字。但是在我国南部的其他少数民族，由于同拉丁字母的文字关系较为密切，或人民群众对拉丁字母的形式较为习惯，将以拉丁字母为字母基础来创制文字。这就需要有计划地研究一下有关字母形式取得一致的问题。因此，中国科学院少数民族语言研究所于今年10月在贵阳召开了民族文字字母形式问题讨论会，专门讨论以拉丁字母为字母基础的拼音文字在字母形式上如何取得一致的问题。大家首先都同意各个以拉丁字母为字母基础的文字彼此间以及它们和汉语拼音方案之间尽可能地在字母形式上取得一致的原则，然后比较了僮傣、苗瑶、藏缅三个语族的各种语言的特点，按照各语族里各种语言的具体需要制定了各语族的字母总表，又汇合制定了一个汉藏语系各少数民族语言字母总表，以供有关的少数民族设计本族文字字母的参考。这对于各民族互相学习语文和文化交流，将起很大的作用。紧接着这个字母形式会议，在贵阳又举行了两个民族的语言科学讨论会。出席苗族语言文字问题科学讨论会的代表们，一致同意暂时把苗语划分为东部、中部、西部和滇东北四个大方言区，并首先解决这些地区的文字问题；其他和这四个方言差别很大的少数地区，等进一步调查研究后再提出解决文字问题的意见。由于这四个方言差别太大，会议同意东部、中部和西部三个方言区各自创制一种文字，滇东北方言区因为原有一种文字，只进行文字改革。这四种文字方案在字母形式和拼写规则上已经尽可能地求得一致，但是也表达了各自的语音特点。这样，就便于互相学习，互相丰富，逐渐地趋向统一。在布依族语言文字问题科学讨论会上，代表们细致地研究了布依语内部的语言差别，布依语和僮语的同异。由于布依语和僮语有极大的共同性，而且地区相连，为了便于文化教育工作的交流和联系，大家一致同意采取布依文和僮文建立文字联盟的方案。布依文在字母形式、拼写规则和语言规范上，尽可能地和僮文取得一致，但是也照顾到布依语的特点。根据这个方案写出来的布依语词，目前和僮文完全相同的就可以超过词汇的半数，将来双方再共同谋求接近，自然会逐渐扩大共同的成分，以致最后达到使用共同的标准语。上述四个语言科学讨论会的规模都是相当大的，出席代表至少也有一百三十八人，多的到二百八十五人，连列席代表在内有多到五百人的。有的代表在讨论文字方案的过程中，就学会用自己的新文字写出自己的意见。如布依族语言文字问题科学讨论会刚刚闭幕，布依族潘如风代表就用刚刚诞生的自己的文字写了一首感谢毛主席的诗，其中有这样一段：
    敬爱的毛主席啊！
    您像父母亲一样地爱护和关怀着我们，
    帮助我们提高了物质生活，
    又帮助我们提高了文化生活。
    创制了布依文字，
    用拉丁字母拼音，
    和僮文联盟，
    真是合心又合意。
    从今天以后，
    我们要专心地努力学习，
    更好地为人民服务！这就说明了拼音文字是很容易学习的，也说明了兄弟民族是怎样热情地欢迎他们自己的文字。
    到目前为止，已经设计了自己的文字方案的有僮、维吾尔、彝（四川）、苗、布依、傣、景颇、傈僳、拉祜、达呼尔、锡伯等十一个民族。因为傣文有两种，苗文有四种，所以共有了十五种文字方案。其中大多数是草案，还没有报中央主管部门审批，有几种方案还没有经过本民族召开会议讨论确定，只是初稿。自己不单独设计新文字方案，采用现有文字的有蒙古、哈萨克、柯尔克孜、乌孜别克、塔塔尔五个民族。总起来说，现在十六个民族已经有了文字创制或改革的初步方案了。我们有苏联的先进语言科学理论和工作经验做参考，自己的语言科学水平也在不断提高，经验也在逐渐丰富，大批的民族语文干部正在成长，各有关单位都很重视这一工作而且已经有计划地在工作上互相配合，这就使我们有充分的信心及早完成党和政府交给我们的任务。
