Xinhua News Agency report: Several remote minority areas in Gansu Province were connected to long-distance telephone lines to cities such as Lanzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai in November.

There is now no county or city in Gansu Province that is not connected to Lanzhou by long-distance telephone. For example, Aksai Kazakh Autonomous County, Subei Mongolian Autonomous County, and Sunan Yugur Autonomous County, which are more than a thousand kilometers away from Lanzhou, can all contact Lanzhou through long-distance telephone lines.

　  甘肃几个少数民族区可以同北京直通电话
    据新华社讯　甘肃省边远的几个少数民族区，都在11月份直接和兰州、北京、上海等城市通达长途电话。
    甘肃全省已经没有一个不和兰州通长途电话的县市。如距兰州一千几百公里的阿克塞哈萨克族自治县、肃北蒙古族自治县和肃南裕固族自治县，通过长途电话线，都可以和兰州联系。
