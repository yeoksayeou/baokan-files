A little essay from the editor

    Just Try Your Best
    The urban traffic congestion has been complained about long enough! In the past, some people always thought this was an unsolvable problem, with the prevailing attitude being that traffic tools must be increased enormously. Actually, that's not entirely the case. Shenyang City, by adopting various methods, has initially alleviated the tense traffic situation, which is the most powerful illustration. And ahead of Shenyang, cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Harbin have also achieved results in this regard.
    Shenyang City has adopted measures such as adjusting work hours, implementing a rotation system, and increasing vehicle turnover rates; they even thought of mobilizing people whose dormitories are close to factories or offices to be more diligent and walk to work. This shows that they are doing this work with all their might and from various aspects, and therefore they have achieved considerable success in this regard.
    Caring about the inconveniences in the lives of the masses, and trying to do good things for the masses to the best of one's ability when there is no money – this is the point I want to introduce to everyone after reading this news from Shenyang City, for the reference of comrades in various cities who manage transportation.

    只要尽力去做
    城市交通拥挤、叫唤的够久了！过去，总有人认为这是无法解决的问题，大有非多多增加交通工具不可之势。其实不尽如此。沈阳市，采用各种办法，初步缓和了交通紧张的情况，是最有力的说明；而走在沈阳前面的，还有北京、上海、天津、哈尔滨等城市在这方面获得的成绩。
    沈阳市采用了调整上下班时间、实行轮流休息制度、提高车辆周转率等办法；甚至于还想到动员宿舍离工厂或办公室近的人，勤劳一些，上下班徒步。这说明他们正在尽力地、从多方面进行这一工作，因此才在这方面取得不少的成绩。
    关心群众生活上的不便，在没有钱的情况下尽力为群众作好事——这就是看了沈阳市这一消息后要向大家介绍的一点心得，供各城市管理交通的同志们参考。
