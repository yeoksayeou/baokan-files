To economize, it is necessary to understand the reality and connect with the masses
The Xinjiang Water Conservancy Department's Survey and Design Institute paid attention to investigating and studying the actual situation in its engineering design work, used the experience of local people, broke the taboo that the salt content of the soil used for dam construction should not exceed 3%, and corrected the fallacy that "water conservancy cannot be built without cement," saving a lot of money for the country.

Urumqi Dispatch from our newspaper on the 20th: The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Water Conservancy Department's Survey and Design Institute has saved a lot of money for the country in the planning and design of water conservancy projects this year.

Xinjiang soil contains varying degrees of salinity. If this kind of soil is used to build an earthen dam, after water is stored, the water in the reservoir will seep through the earthen dam and carry away easily soluble salts, which may damage the earthen dam. Therefore, the amount of easily soluble salt in the soil used for dam construction needs to be limited. In the past, when designing the earthen dams of reservoirs, the figures suggested by Soviet experts in a specific situation were followed, and it was believed that if the salt content of the soil (that is, the percentage of salt weight in the salt-soil weight) exceeded 3%, it could not be used for dam construction. For example, the soil near the Mengjin Reservoir in the Urumqi River basin had a salt content that often exceeded 3%. The design estimated that soil would have to be taken from several kilometers away, increasing the cost of the project. Due to the large amount of transportation, trucks would also have to be used to transport the soil. Therefore, the average unit price of each cubic meter of the Mengjin Reservoir's earthen dam was as high as ten yuan. This year, the technical personnel of the Water Conservancy Department went deep into the site to understand the situation and discovered that the soil on the earthen dams of the "August 1st" and Chepaizi Reservoirs, which were built in 1952, had a salt content exceeding 3%, and no problems had occurred for several years (recent Soviet experience also proves that the salt content of the soil used for dam construction can exceed 3%). In this way, the unit price of each cubic meter of an earthen dam in general circumstances was reduced to two to four yuan. The total cost of the August 1st Reservoir designed according to the old standard was 5.3 million yuan. Due to the reasonable increase of water-soluble salt content in the soil and the adoption of a reasonable dam line, the unit cost of construction was reduced to 2.2 million yuan. By appropriately relaxing the standard for salt content, 6.65 million yuan was saved for the country throughout the year.

In Xinjiang, canals often have to pass through steep Gobi deserts. In the past, in order to prevent water from seeping into the Gobi, a lot of cement was always used. This year, the Water Conservancy Department sent people to Wuwei and Zhangye in Gansu to learn from the experience of farmers using dry-laid cobblestones to pave and protect canals. They realized that cement could not be used when building canals in the Gobi, and dry-laid cobblestones could also achieve a certain degree of seepage prevention. The Harlayuergun River irrigation canal in Wensu County, the 19th Canal in Kuqa County, and the Turpan People's Canal and Wusu Ganhezi Canal, which are currently under construction, are all very cheap projects. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have accumulated very valuable experience in building water conservancy for thousands of years. The Water Conservancy Department has learned from the experience of the masses and opposed the idea that "water conservancy cannot be built without cement." By using local materials instead of cement, it has saved the country thousands of tons of cement.

The above-mentioned changes have greatly reduced the cost of water storage and diversion projects, which are two key issues in Xinjiang's water conservancy, and the technology has also been simplified. Under the conditions that cooperation is realized in rural areas and labor can play a more rational and fuller role, it is possible to use the method of government assistance and public administration to build some larger farmland water conservancy projects in rural Xinjiang. The mass water conservancy projects built this year have increased by two times compared with last year. The planned benefits of the projects to be built next year will be seven times that of this year.

    要节约，就要了解实际，联系群众
    新疆水利厅勘测设计院在工程设计工作中注意调查研究实际情况，运用当地群众经验，打破了筑坝用土含盐量不能超过3％的戒律，纠正了“离开水泥就不能兴修水利”的谬论，为国家节约了大量资金。
    本报乌鲁木齐20日电　新疆维吾尔自治区水利厅勘测设计院今年在水利工程的规划设计中，为国家大量节约了资金。
    新疆土壤中含有不同程度的盐碱。如果拿这种土壤筑成土坝，蓄水之后，库内的水经过土坝渗漏，会带走容易溶解的盐分，可能破坏土坝。因此，筑坝用土中含易溶性盐的份量需要有所限制。从前在设计水库的土坝的时候，都是按苏联专家在某一个具体情况下所建议的数字执行，认为土壤中的含盐量（即土壤中含盐的重量占盐土重量的百分比）超过了3％，就不能用来筑坝。像乌鲁木齐河流域的猛进水库，附近土壤含盐量很多超过了3％，设计中预计要到几公里以外取土，使工程造价随着增高。由于运量大，还须用汽车运土。因此，猛进水库土坝每立方公尺平均单价高达十元。今年，水利厅的技术人员深入现场了解，发现了1952年兴修的“八一”和车牌子水库土坝上的土壤含盐量超过了3％，几年了并没有发生问题（苏联最近的经验也证明，筑坝用土含盐量可以超过3％）。这样，一般情况下土坝每立方公尺的单价减为二至四元。按旧标准设计的八一水库总造价为五百三十万元，由于合理地提高土料中水溶盐含量，加以采用了合理的坝线，施工结果，单位造价降低到二百二十万元。由于适当放宽含盐量标准，今年全年为国家节约了六百六十五万元。
    新疆修建渠道，往往要通过坡度较陡的戈壁滩。以前为了避免水渗漏到戈壁里去，总是使用很多水泥。今年，水利厅派人到甘肃武威、张掖等地学习农民用干砌卵石铺护渠道的经验，认识到在戈壁上修渠可以不用水泥，干砌卵石也可以达到某种程度防渗的效果。今年修筑的温宿县哈拉玉儿滚河引水渠，库车县的一九渠，现在正在修筑的吐鲁番人民渠、乌苏干河子渠等，都是很便宜的工程。新疆各族劳动人民，几千年来兴修水利积累了非常宝贵的经验，水利厅学习了群众的经验，反对“离了水泥就不能兴修水利”的想法，用当地材料代替水泥，为国家节约了上千吨的水泥。
    上述改变，使新疆水利上两个关键问题——蓄水工程和引水工程的造价大大降低，技术也简单了一些。在农村实现合作化，劳动力能更合理更充分地发挥作用的条件下，就有可能用民办公助的办法，在新疆农村兴筑一些较大的农田水利工程。今年兴修的群众水利，较去年增长了两倍。明年计划兴修的工程的效益，为今年的七倍。
