    Welcoming the National Agricultural Exhibition
    In order to welcome the National Agricultural Exhibition to be held in Beijing, the Shanghai Working Team of the China Sculpture Factory sculpted a giant statue, five meters high, symbolizing the alliance of workers and peasants. The sculpture depicts workers and peasants advancing under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party to build socialism. The picture shows comrades Zhang Yonghao, Mao Chengde, and Hu Chuanwen putting the finishing touches on the statue.
