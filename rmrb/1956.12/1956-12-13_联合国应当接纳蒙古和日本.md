    The United Nations Should Admit Mongolia and Japan
    Shortly after the opening of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly, it unanimously admitted Sudan, Morocco, and Tunisia as new member states of the United Nations. These three countries, after a long struggle against colonial rule, finally freed themselves from the shackles of imperialism and gained independence. Their accession to the United Nations will undoubtedly strengthen the forces within this international organization that oppose colonialism and maintain peace.
    Now, the United Nations Security Council is discussing the applications of the Mongolian People's Republic and Japan to join the United Nations. Both countries are important nations in Asia. During the general debate of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly, many countries expressed their support for the applications of these two countries to join the United Nations. According to the principle of universality of the United Nations member states, they should be admitted as new member states of the United Nations without exception.
    However, it is worth noting that the United States continues to adopt a rude and unreasonable attitude on this issue. On December 6, the spokesman for the United States delegation claimed that the United States would support Japan's application, but insisted that the Mongolian People's Republic was "not qualified to join the United Nations." The day after the United States announced this attitude, the representative of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which had long been spurned by the Chinese people, immediately responded, openly stating that it would once again "veto" the application of the Mongolian People's Republic. People remember that during the last session of the United Nations General Assembly, the United States instructed the Chiang Kai-shek clique to sabotage a plan to admit eighteen countries into the United Nations, and now it is attempting to use the same despicable means to exclude the Mongolian People's Republic.
    The excuse used by the United States to obstruct the Mongolian People's Republic from joining the United Nations is simply untenable. The Mongolian People's Republic has been independent for thirty-five years. Since its founding, the Mongolian People's Republic has pursued a peaceful foreign policy. During World War II, it stood on the side of the Allies, providing economic resources and armed forces, and made its own contribution to the common cause of the United Nations. The Mongolian People's Republic strictly abides by the principles of peaceful coexistence among peoples and steadfastly expands its international contacts and cooperation. The Mongolian People's Republic now maintains diplomatic relations with countries accounting for more than half of the world's population, including the world powers of the Soviet Union, China, and India, and is constantly expanding its economic and cultural ties with other countries. These facts prove that the Mongolian People's Republic fully meets the requirements of the United Nations Charter and has every right to become a member state.
    The arrogant attitude of the United States in trying to exclude countries it dislikes from the United Nations once again demonstrates that it still wants to continue to control the United Nations and use this international organization as a tool of its foreign policy. At the beginning of the current session, the United States manipulated some countries to reject India's reasonable proposal to restore our country's legitimate seat in the United Nations. On December 7, the United States openly violated the provisions of the United Nations Charter and undermined the "London Gentlemen's Agreement" by forcibly pushing the Philippines into the non-permanent seat on the Security Council that should belong to Eastern European countries, thereby depriving Eastern European countries of their legitimate rights. This behavior of the United States, like its attempt to obstruct the Mongolian People's Republic from joining the United Nations, is a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter and has caused enormous damage to the cause of the United Nations.
    The Mongolian People's Republic and Japan are both our neighbors, and we support their application to join the United Nations. In admitting new member states, the United Nations should enable all sovereign states to participate in this organization and work together to maintain world peace and security and promote international trust and cooperation.

### 联合国应当接纳蒙古和日本

    联合国应当接纳蒙古和日本
    本届联合国大会在开幕后不久，便以全体一致票接纳了苏丹、摩洛哥和突尼斯三国为联合国的新会员国。这三个国家，经过了反对殖民主义统治的长期斗争，终于相继摆脱了帝国主义的桎梏，获得了独立。它们加入联合国，无疑将会加强这个国际组织中反对殖民主义和维护和平的力量。
    现在，联合国安全理事会又在进行讨论蒙古人民共和国和日本申请加入联合国的问题。这两个国家都是亚洲的重要国家。在本届联合国大会的一般性辩论中，许多国家表示支持这两个国家加入联合国的申请。根据联合国会员国具有普遍性的原则，它们是应当无例外地被接纳为联合国的新会员国的。
    但是，值得注意的是，美国在这个问题上继续采取着一种蛮横无理的态度。美国代表团发言人本月6日声称，美国将支持日本的申请，但是对于蒙古人民共和国却硬说它“没有资格加入联合国”。在美国宣布了这种态度的第二天，早经为中国人民唾弃的蒋介石集团的代表就立即响应，公然表示将再度“否决”蒙古人民共和国的申请。人们记得，美国在上届联合国大会期间，就曾指使蒋介石集团破坏了一次接纳十八个国家进入联合国的计划，现在它又企图用同样卑劣的手法来排斥蒙古人民共和国。
    美国阻挠蒙古人民共和国加入联合国的借口是根本站不住脚的。蒙古人民共和国获得独立已经有三十五年的历史了。从它成立之日起，蒙古人民共和国就奉行着爱好和平的政策，在第二次世界大战期间，它站在同盟国方面，提供了经济资源和武装力量，对于联合国的共同事业作出了自己的贡献。蒙古人民共和国严守各国人民和平共处的原则，坚定不移地扩大自己的国际联系和合作。蒙古人民共和国现在同占全世界人口半数以上的国家，包括苏联、中国和印度这些世界大国保持着外交关系，并且不断扩大着它同其他国家的经济和文化联系。这些事实证明，蒙古人民共和国完全符合联合国宪章的要求，有充分的权利成为它的会员国。
    美国力图把它所不喜欢的国家排斥在联合国之外的蛮横态度，再度表明它依然想继续控制联合国，把这个国际组织作为它的外交政策的工具。在本届大会之初，美国操纵一些国家，否决了印度提出的关于恢复我国在联合国的合法地位的合理建议。本月7日美国又公然违反联合国宪章的规定，破坏“伦敦君子协定”，硬把菲律宾强塞进安理会应属于东欧国家非常任理事的席位上，以此来剥夺东欧国家的合法权利。美国的这种所做所为，同它企图阻挠蒙古人民共和国加入联合国一样，都是对联合国宪章的粗暴破坏，给联合国的事业造成了巨大的损害。
    蒙古人民共和国和日本都是我们的邻国，我们支持它们要求加入联合国的申请。联合国在接纳新会员国问题上，应当使所有主权国家都能参加这个组织，为维护世界和平和安全，促进国际信任和合作而共同努力。
