    What Standard?
    In Nanning City, Guangxi Province, many factory and mine workers' family members have requested to join the Party, but the Party organizations are indifferent to these requests. For example, Xie Shaofen, a family member of a worker at the Nanning City Waterworks, has actively participated in family work within the factory since 1951, was selected as a special model for municipal women's work, and attended the National Advanced Producers Conference. For the past two years, Xie Shaofen has consistently requested to join the Party, but the Party branch has consistently refused. Is Xie Shaofen not qualified to be a Communist Party member? No, the branch simply thinks it is because she is not a cadre. This is strange. Which article or clause in the Party Constitution stipulates that only cadres can join the Party, and that family members of cadres are not qualified to join the Party? (Wu Naishuang, Ye Ming)

    什么标准
    广西省南宁市有不少厂矿职工的家属要求入党，但党组织对这种要求漠不关心。譬如说，南宁市自来水厂职工家属谢少芬，自1951年起积极参加厂内家属工作，被选为市妇女工作者特等模范，出席了全国先进生产者会议。近两年来，谢少芬一直要求入党，党支部一直都不同意。是谢少芬不够共产党员的条件吗？并不是，支部仅仅因为她不是干部。这就奇怪了，党章上有哪一条哪一款规定过只有干部才能入党，干部的家属就没有资格入党呢？（吴乃双、叶明）
