Xinhua News Agency, December 1st: The workers of Kowloon, Hong Kong are preparing to hold a memorial service on the 2nd to mourn the compatriots who died in the Kowloon riot incident. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram yesterday to the memorial service for the compatriots who died in the Kowloon riot incident in Hong Kong, expressing condolences to the deceased compatriots.

The telegram first expressed condolences to the compatriots who were killed in the Kowloon incident, and extended the most sincere sympathy to the workers, staff, and all Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots who were shocked, injured, and suffered losses.

The telegram said: The Kowloon riot incident was a completely unprecedented and brutal act planned by Kuomintang secret agents, and the British authorities in Hong Kong have adopted a conniving attitude, allowing the secret agents to kill our compatriots, and doing everything possible to exonerate the culprits. We cannot but express our great indignation at this. We believe that the British authorities in Hong Kong must thoroughly deal with this riot incident, severely punish the Kuomintang secret agent culprits, ensure the safety of residents' lives and property, and provide appropriate compensation to the families of the deceased and the injured.

    中华全国总工会
　　致电悼念九龙事件死难同胞
    新华社1日讯　香港九龙工人准备在2日举行追悼九龙暴乱事件中的死难同胞大会。中华全国总工会特在昨天打电报给香港的追悼九龙暴乱事件中的死难同胞大会，悼念死难同胞。
    电文中首先向在九龙事件中被难的同胞表示哀悼，对受惊、受伤、受损失的工人、职员和全体港九同胞表示最亲切的慰问。
    电文中说：九龙暴乱事件完全是国民党特务分子策划的空前未有的、残酷的暴行，而香港英国当局竟采取纵容的态度，任凭特务分子杀戮我同胞，并且千方百计为祸首开脱罪责，对此，我们不能不表示极大的愤慨。我们认为，香港英国当局必须彻底处理这次暴乱事件，严惩国民党特务祸首，必须切实保障居民的生命财产的安全，必须对死亡者的家属和受伤者给予适当的善后处理。
