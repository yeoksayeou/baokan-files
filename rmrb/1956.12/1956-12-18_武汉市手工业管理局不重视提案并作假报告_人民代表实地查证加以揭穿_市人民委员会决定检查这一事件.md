Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 16th: People's Representatives of Wuhan Municipality recently inspected the work of the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Handicrafts and discovered that the report by this bureau on the handling of proposals from the Wuhan Municipal People's Congress was untrue, proving that this bureau did not seriously treat the legitimate suggestions made by the People's Representatives.

This report, on the surface, seemed to have ensured that every representative proposal was followed up and addressed, but it could not withstand careful scrutiny and factual verification. The inspection team led by Dai Jinsheng, a representative of the Wuhan Municipal People's Congress, conducted a specific study and on-the-spot investigation of this report and found that some of the nine proposals claimed to have been resolved had not actually been resolved. For example, one proposal requested that the Thirteenth Ironware Production Cooperative should not place materials on the sidewalk, obstructing traffic; but the report stated that they had built a certain number of square meters of simple warehouses, while in reality, iron bars were still placed on the sidewalk. Another proposal requested that the Leather Production Cooperative under the Bureau of Handicrafts should improve the quality of leather goods processing, but the report replied that "the ordering department should strengthen inspection," implying that the ordering department did not have good eyesight and did not inspect properly, and that the public's complaints had nothing to do with them. Another example is a proposal requesting that the Printing and Dyeing Cooperative under this bureau should improve the quality of dyed fabrics to prevent colored cloth from fading when exposed to water, but the report replied that "fading is unavoidable after one exposure to water." In addition, the report contained materials that were completely inconsistent with the facts. For example, a proposal requested the production of some small-footed leather shoes to meet the needs of middle-aged and older women. The report replied: "A portion of small-footed leather shoes has been made in the Second and Third Leather Shoe Production Cooperatives, but the overall situation is that supply cannot meet demand." In reality, when the representatives went to inspect the above two cooperatives, the members said that they had never produced small-footed leather shoes, and had only made a pair for a family member in January of this year.

From the beginning of September, when the Municipal People's Congress was held, the Bureau of Handicrafts ignored the representatives' proposals for a month and a half. When the People's Representatives inspected the handling situation in late November, the leaders of the Bureau of Handicrafts were still evasive. Only after repeated urging by the representatives did they resort to last-minute efforts, sending a few cadres to spend a week patching together this untruthful report.

After the People's Representatives exposed the above facts, Li Pinli, Deputy Director of the Bureau of Handicrafts, on the one hand, admitted his mistake, and on the other hand, explained that he had only looked at the report once after it was issued and only then did he realize that there were problems. He also asked the representatives to help him "cry about the difficulties."

The Wuhan Municipal People's Committee has decided to investigate this incident. The People's Representatives are also paying close attention and hope that the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Handicrafts will change this bad practice.

    武汉市手工业管理局不重视提案并作假报告
    人民代表实地查证加以揭穿
    市人民委员会决定检查这一事件
    新华社武汉16日电　武汉市人民代表大会代表最近视察了武汉市手工业管理局的工作，在视察中发现这个管理局对武汉市人民代表大会提案的处理情况报告是不真实的，证明了这个局没有认真对待人民代表所提出的正当建议。
    这份报告表面看起来似乎已经对代表提案作到了案案有着落，件件有交代，但是，它却经不起认真的推敲和事实的检验。武汉市人民代表大会代表戴今生率领的视察组对这份报告进行了具体研究和实地查证以后，发现这份报告中所谓已经解决的九条提案中，有些并没有解决。如提案要求第十三铁业生产合作社不应在人行道上放置材料，妨碍交通；而报告中却说他们已经修了多少平方米的简易库房，实际上人行道上依然放着铁条。提案要求手工业管理局所属皮业生产合作社加工皮货时应提高质量，报告却答复说“订货部门应加强检查”，意思是说订货部门眼力不高，没有好好检查，人民群众有意见与己无关。又如提案要求这个局所属印染社提高染布质量，以免色布见水退色，报告中却答复说“见水一次，退色不可避免”。此外，报告中并有和事实完全不符的材料。如提案要求生产一些小脚皮鞋，以满足中年以上妇女的需要。报告答复说：“小脚皮鞋已在第二、三皮鞋生产合作社做了一部分，但总的情况是供不应求”。而实际上，当代表到上述两个社检查时，社员却说他们从未生产过小脚皮鞋，只在今年元月份为家属做了一双。
    从9月上旬市人民代表大会举行以后，在一个半月的时间里，手工业管理局对代表提案一直置之不理。当11月下旬人民代表检查处理情况时，手工业管理局领导上还在支吾。在代表再三催促下，他们才临时抱佛脚，派了几个干部花了一个星期的时间，东拼西凑，写出这份不真实的报告来。
    在人民代表揭发了上述事实以后，手工业管理局副局长李品立一面表示承认错误，一面又解释说那个报告在发出之后他才看了一遍，才发觉有问题，他还要求代表帮他“喊喊困难”。
    武汉市人民委员会已决定对这一事件进行检查。人民代表们也以十分关注的心情，希望武汉市手工业管理局改变这种不良的作风。
