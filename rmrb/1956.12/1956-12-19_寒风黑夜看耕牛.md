    Watching Over Plowing Cattle in the Cold Wind and Dark Night

    On the evening of November 11th, the sky was not yet completely dark, and dark clouds filled the sky. A biting cold wind blew fiercely, making the room seem gloomy.

    At this moment, Li Hongcai (a Party member), the deputy director of the "August 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in Huayan Township, Anyue County, Sichuan, had just returned from inspecting production in various teams and was bandaging his foot, which had become infected with pus. A gust of cold wind blew in from outside the door, and he couldn't help but shiver. He suddenly remembered the cattle pens he had seen during the day, many of which did not provide shelter from the wind. In such cold weather, how could the plowing cattle endure it? Without hesitation, he picked up his cane and, enduring the pain in his foot, limped to the third and fourth teams to inspect.

    Whenever he arrived at the home of a cattle feeder, he would patiently explain the importance of protecting the plowing cattle and repeatedly instructed them to pay attention to their care. The cattle feeders were deeply moved by his spirit of hard work and responsibility and automatically reinforced the surroundings of the cattle pens and added bedding straw for the cattle.

    The wind blew harder and harder, and the road was pitch black. Li Hongcai did not bring a flashlight. By the time he finished his inspection and groped his way back home, it was already past midnight.

    The next day, Director Li's actions of inspecting and managing the plowing cattle in the dark of night quickly spread throughout the cooperative. Zhang Lianshan, the captain of the fourth team, said: "Li Hongcai is a good example for us to learn from."

    寒风黑夜看耕牛
    11月11日的傍晚，天还没有黑尽，满天布满了乌云，忽忽地冷风吹得刺骨，屋里显得黑沉沉的。
    这时，四川安岳县华严乡“八一”农业社副主任李洪才（党员），刚从各队检查生产回来，正在包扎他的那只已涨脓的脚板。一股冷风从门外吹来，他禁不住打了一个寒噤，猛地想起了白天看到的那些牛圈，很多都不避风，这样冷的天气，耕牛还能受得了吗？他毫不犹豫地拿起了手杖，忍着脚板的疼痛，一?一跛的到三、四队去检查。
    当他每走到一家喂牛户的家里时，总是耐心地讲解保护耕牛的重要，一再吩咐他们要注意照看。喂牛户见到他这种不辞劳苦认真负责的精神，大大受到感动，都自动地把牛圈四周拦好，并给牛丢了窝子草。
    风越吹越紧，路黑得看不见，李洪才又没有带电筒，等着他检查完摸索回到家里，已经半夜了。
    第二天，李主任黑夜检查对耕牛管理的事迹很快传遍了全社，第四队队长张连山说：“李洪才硬是我们学习的好榜样。”
