Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 15th - Soviet experts assisting our country in the surveying and designing of the Hami to border section of the Lanxin Railway have put forward many suggestions to ensure the economic viability and rationality of this section.

From the beginning of the survey of this route in March of last year, Soviet experts went to the area along the line more than once to provide technical guidance and assistance. They successively put forward nearly 300 suggestions concerning shortening the route, improving engineering quality, saving construction costs, and ensuring traffic safety. They also climbed mountains and waded through rivers with Chinese railway surveyors, conducting research and comparisons tirelessly, solving many technical problems in areas with poor geological conditions such as the Tianshan Mountains, deserts, swamps, and gypsum layers. In order to survey the route in the Jinghe swamp area, Soviet experts rode horses all day long, wading through the mud, enduring attacks from swarms of mosquitoes and horseflies. Finally, they helped the railway surveyors select a more ideal route in the swamp, which the local farmers and herdsmen considered impassable. This route is more than seven kilometers shorter than the initially determined route, which can save more than 1.1 million yuan in construction costs.

Soviet experts provided valuable advice on many major projects in this section of the line. After analyzing the geological conditions such as rock weathering and collapse in the Tianshan gap, expert Hvosgik compared it with certain sections of the Baolan Road and Baocheng Road, and proposed the Tianshan Tunnel plan, which is of decisive significance for preventing collapse and ensuring future traffic safety, and also saves engineering costs and operating expenses.

    苏联专家的贡献
    新华社乌鲁木齐15日电　帮助我国勘测设计兰新铁路哈密到国境段线路的苏联专家，提出了很多保证这段线路经济、合理的建议。
    从去年3月这段路线开始勘测的时候起，苏联专家们不止一次地到沿线进行技术指导和帮助。他们先后提出了有关缩短线路、提高工程质量、节省工程造价和保证行车安全等各项建议近三百条，并且同我国铁路勘测人员一起爬山、下水，不辞辛苦地进行研究、比较，解决了铁路通过天山、沙漠、沼泽、石膏层等地质不良地区的许多技术问题。为了勘测精河沼泽地带的线路，苏联专家们整天骑马跋涉在泥水中，忍受着成群蚊子、牛虻的袭击，终于帮助铁路勘测人员在当地农牧民认为无法通行的沼泽中选定了一条比较理想的线路。这条路线比最初确定的线路缩短了七公里多，可以节省建筑费用一百一十多万元。
    苏联专家对这段线路的许多重大工程提供了宝贵建议。赫伏斯吉克专家分析了天山缺口的岩石风化、坍塌等地质情况以后，同宝兰路、宝成路某些地段作了比较，提出了天山隧道方案，对防止坍方、保证今后行车安全具有决定性的意义，同时还节省了工程造价和运营费。
