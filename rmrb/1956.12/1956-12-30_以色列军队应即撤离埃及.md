Observer Commentary:

    The Israeli army should withdraw from Egypt immediately.
    After the Anglo-French invading forces were forced to roll out of Port Said, the only invading force remaining on Egyptian territory is the Israeli army. Disregarding the United Nations General Assembly resolutions and the severe condemnation of world public opinion, the Israeli government still stubbornly clings to the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip. Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion even publicly declared that Israel would not return Gaza to Egypt. In the areas from which they have already withdrawn, the Israeli army has engaged in serious destruction, looting, arson, and murder.
    Israel's delay in withdrawing its troops and its illegal activities of attempting to occupy Egyptian territory for a long period are not only a threat to peace in Egypt, but also a threat to peace in the Middle East. The whole world expects that after the Anglo-French invading forces are forced to withdraw from Egypt, peace in Egypt can be restored quickly, and the situation in the Middle East can be further eased. However, Israel's illegal behavior is hindering the complete realization of peace in the Middle East. Obviously, this only benefits the Western colonial powers and will not be of any benefit to Israel.
    Israel dares to delay the withdrawal of its troops and clamor for the occupation of Egyptian territory, obviously with the connivance and support of Western colonial countries behind it. Senior U.S. officials recently publicly declared that the United States would "reconsider" the final status of Egypt in the Gaza Strip. From the statement issued by official sources in Paris a few days ago, it can be seen that France is also encouraging Israel not to withdraw its troops from Gaza and Sharm el-Sheikh on the Sinai Peninsula. Their purpose in encouraging Israel to do so is to continue to use Israel to exert pressure on Egypt, so that they can violate Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal and maintain the tense situation in the Middle East. On this point, Reuters' Washington dispatch on December 22 has made it very clear: "The United States has stepped up pressure on Egypt and Syria," and this pressure will "continue to increase."
    Israel's action of delaying the withdrawal of its troops with the connivance of Western colonial countries is a complete violation of the United Nations resolutions. According to the resolutions passed by the United Nations General Assembly on November 2 and 7, the Israeli army should immediately withdraw from Egyptian territory and return to behind the 1949 Egypt-Israel armistice line. In order to maintain peace in the Middle East, to safeguard the integrity of Egypt's territorial sovereignty and the dignity of the United Nations resolutions, the United Nations has a responsibility to take further measures to force the Israeli army to withdraw from Egyptian territory quickly, so that peace in the Middle East can be restored quickly.

### 以色列军队应即撤离埃及

    以色列军队应即撤离埃及
    英法侵略军被迫从塞得港滚出去以后，在埃及领土上存在的唯一侵略部队就是以色列的军队了。以色列政府不顾联合国大会的决议和全世界舆论的严厉谴责，至今仍把它的军队死赖在西奈半岛和加沙地区。以色列总理本—古里安竟公然宣布，以色列将不把加沙归还给埃及。而在已经撤退的地区，以色列军队进行了严重的破坏、抢劫和烧杀。
    以色列拖延撤军和妄想长期侵占埃及领土的非法活动，不仅是对于埃及和平的威胁，也是对中东和平的威胁。全世界都期望在英法侵略军被迫撤出埃及以后，埃及的和平能够从速恢复，中东局势能够得到进一步的缓和。但是，以色列的这种非法行为，阻挠着中东和平的完全实现。显然，这只有利于西方殖民国家，对以色列不会有任何好处。
    以色列敢于拖延撤军和叫嚣占有埃及领土，显然得到西方殖民国家在背后的纵容和支持。美国的高级官员最近就曾公开地宣称，美国要对埃及在加沙地区的最后地位作“重新考虑”；从前几天巴黎官方人士发表的声明中可以看出，法国也正在鼓励以色列不要把军队撤出加沙和西奈半岛上的沙姆沙伊赫。它们鼓励以色列这样做，目的是想继续利用以色列来对埃及施加压力，以便使它们得以侵犯埃及的苏伊士运河主权，保持中东的紧张局势。关于这一点，路透社12月22日的华盛顿电讯已经说得很清楚：“美国已经加强了对埃及和叙利亚的压力”，并且这种压力还会“不断加强”。
    以色列在西方殖民国家的纵容下拖延撤军的行动，是完全违反联合国的决议的。根据联合国大会在11月2日和7日所通过的决议，以色列军队应该立即撤出埃及领土，退回到1949年以埃停战线的后面去。为了维护中东的和平，为了维护埃及领土主权的完整和联合国决议的尊严，联合国有责任采取进一步的措施，迫使以色列军队迅速从埃及领土上撤回去，使中东和平得以迅速恢复。
