In the Ethnic Minority Goods Store

In the windows and counters of the Victory Road Ethnic Minority Goods Store of the Baotou City Trading Company, various daily necessities favored by ethnic minorities are displayed. There are Mongolian robes, various boots, knives with silver scabbards, saddles, horsewhips, and precious gifts such as Hada scarves and face powder rolls; there are also hats worn by the Uyghur and Hui people.

One Sunday at noon, a young Mongolian man came to the store to buy satin fabric. The salesperson, Geriletu, enthusiastically took out two kinds of satin fabric with floral patterns, one dark blue and one dark green, to show him. The customer felt that the colors of these two fabrics were too dark and the patterns were too old, and that they would not look good on young women, so he did not buy them. Geriletu then told him, "Come back in a few days, and we will prepare some fabrics that you like."

Mongolians have different preferences due to different living conditions. Mongolians in the Siziwang Banner area like to wear pointed-toe Qian Di Siyun boots; Mongolians in the Ikezhao League and other places like to wear round-toe fragrant leather felt boots. That day, another customer wanted to buy a pair of boots, so Geriletu first asked him where he lived, and then selected a pair of fragrant leather felt boots for him according to the preferences of the people in that area. The customer tried them on, and they fit perfectly, so he happily bought the boots.

A salesperson told me: "Comrade Geriletu not only has a good service attitude, but is also very familiar with the business. She has been praised by customers many times." (Xu Jiping)

    在少数民族用品门市部里
    在包头市贸易公司胜利路少数民族用品门市部的橱窗和柜台里，摆满了少数民族喜爱的各种日常用品。里面有蒙古人民穿的长袍，各种靴子，套有银质刀鞘的刀子，有马鞍、马?和高贵的礼品哈达、粉卷等；也有维吾尔族和回族戴的帽子。
    一个星期日的中午，一位年轻的蒙古人到门市部要买缎料。售货员格日勒图便热情地从柜台里拿出深蓝和深绿色的两样带团花的缎料给他看。顾客嫌这两种衣料颜色太深，花太旧，年轻女人穿起来不好看没有买。格日勒图便告诉他：“你过些日子再来，我们给准备一些您喜欢的衣料。”
    蒙古人因为居住条件不同，喜好也不同。四子王旗一带的蒙古人，爱穿尖头的千底四云靴；伊克昭盟等地的蒙古人就爱穿圆头的香牛皮皂靴。那天，另一位顾客要买一双靴子，格日勒图便先问他住在那里，以后便根据那个地区人们的爱好，选了一双香牛皮皂靴给他。顾客穿了穿挺合适，高兴地把靴子买走了。
    一个售货员对我说：“格日勒图同志不但服务态度好，对业务也很熟悉。她已受到顾客好多次的表扬了。”　（徐霁萍）
