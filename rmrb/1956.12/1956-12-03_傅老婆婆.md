    I lived in Granny Fu's house for more than a month, just as the township was holding elections for people's representatives.

    Granny Fu was over seventy years old, her hair completely white. She had lost more than half of her teeth and walked unsteadily, sometimes using a crooked cane she had received during the land reform to get from her room to the drying ground.

    On the evening before National Day, Granny Fu went to the gate like she was expecting her son-in-law, looking at the gloomy sky and saying in disappointment, "This damn weather is really messing things up!" At that moment, the sound of gongs came from the back of the village, and it was clear that the village director was calling everyone to a meeting on time. Granny Fu muttered to herself again, "His throat is already hoarse from shouting, how will he make his report later?"

    It turned out that the village was holding a voters' meeting that night, where six candidates would make reports. Before this, the masses had already discussed for several nights. The masses did not oppose these candidates, but they also criticized many of their shortcomings in their work and style. For example, Granny Fu had an opinion about the village director. One night, at a small group meeting held in her hall, everyone had already made most of their points, but the village director repeatedly encouraged everyone, saying, "Raise them, raise them, even the smallest things must be raised!" Granny Fu, who was sitting in an inconspicuous corner by the wall, was originally dozing off, but when she heard the village director's words, she seemed to be burned by fire, raised her head, glared at the village director, and said unhappily, "Raise? If I'm going to raise something, I have an opinion about you!"

    It turned out that this spring the village drafted a production plan, striving to increase the village's production by 25%. Everyone was making guarantees, and Granny Fu was also very happy and wanted to make a few guarantees, but as soon as she opened her mouth, someone else spoke first. There were many people, and she was slow to speak, so the village director shook his head and waved his hand, saying:
  "Hey, you old woman, isn't it okay to be a little careless?" Granny Fu's face immediately fell, and she walked away angrily.

      "Hmph, what kind of style!" Granny Fu now mentioned this matter, her chest heaving as if she was still angry, "Look at me being clumsy, look down on me, suppressing my enthusiasm!" This caused everyone in the hall to laugh.

    After each group reported the situation of the discussion, the cadres and candidates were shocked, feeling that if they hadn't thoroughly mobilized the masses to inspect, no one would have paid attention to opinions like Granny Fu's. Therefore, they decided to hold a voters' meeting, where those who should make self-criticisms should do so publicly, and those who should explain should do so patiently, hoping to make the meeting a success.

    The meeting place was set up in the village's elementary school. Although the wind and rain had not stopped, the men and women who went to the meeting were even more enthusiastic than usual when going to see a play. I also took an umbrella and walked out, only to see Granny Fu arguing with her daughter-in-law at the door:

    The daughter-in-law said, "Mother, have some virtue, don't go teetering and tottering!"

    The mother-in-law said, "I'll teeter and totter if I want to, don't you worry about it!"

    The daughter-in-law said, "If the wind blows and the rain hits, you'll have a cough again tonight, why bother!"

    Someone else interjected, "Yes, there's no election tonight."

    Granny Fu got angry, rolled her eyes, "You people, you're all in cahoots, you all look down on me, an old woman, I just want to hear how the director makes his self-criticism!" Saying that, she kept teetering and tottering forward. The daughter-in-law had no choice but to stick out her tongue and hurry up to support her.

    The meeting lasted from eight o'clock to twelve o'clock. Six candidates spoke one after another, and hundreds of voters listened in complete silence. Apart from the speeches on the stage, the sound of children snoring in the women's arms, and the applause that arose whenever a candidate finished speaking, you could hear a pin drop.

    I stood behind the podium, leaning against the wall, directly facing Granny Fu, who was sitting in the front row. She quietly looked at the speaker's face, blinking her eyelids from time to time, flashing her eyebrows, and even swallowing her saliva as if she were eating honey. Suddenly, she looked at me, wrinkled her nose, pursed her lips, pointed a finger quietly at the stage, and couldn't help but chuckle. What was she laughing at? Oh, she was laughing at the fact that the person making the report on the stage was the village director. And he was making a self-criticism about his hasty and impatient work style, and even used Granny Fu's opinion as an example, saying that his listening to the opinions of the masses was not comprehensive... I couldn't help but laugh too.

    The meeting ended, and people walked out of the meeting place contentedly. I returned to Granny Fu's house and felt very tired. As soon as I entered the room, I fell asleep. Suddenly, I heard the stairs creaking next door, followed by unsteady footsteps from upstairs.

    "Who is it?"

      "It's me!" To my surprise, it was Granny Fu. "Well, I'm turning out a new piece of clothing, so I can go to the election meeting tomorrow. The young people, a few days ago, went to the street to buy this and that, all red and green, dressing up like brides. As for me, even if I dress up, I'm still an old woman, so I'll just put on this shirting fabric gown..." She was still saying something, but I was already too sleepy to hear clearly.

　　傅老婆婆
　　王克浪
    我在傅老婆婆家里住了一个多月，正当乡里进行人民代表选举。
    傅老婆婆七十多岁，发已全白。牙齿掉了一多半，走路摇摇摆摆的，有时从房里走到晒坪，还拄着一根土地改革时分到的弯弯曲曲的拐棍。
    国庆节前一天的黄昏，傅老婆婆像盼望女婿似地走到大门边，望望阴沉沉的天，失望地说：“这个鬼天气，真捣蛋！”这时，村后边噹噹地传来敲锣声，一听是村主任在喊大家准时开会。傅老婆婆又自言自语地说：“听他喉咙都喊哑了，等一下怎么作报告。”
    原来今晚村里要开选民大会，由六位候选人作报告。这以前，群众已经讨论了几个晚上。群众不反对这些候选人，可也指责了他们工作上、作风上不少缺点。比如傅老婆婆就对村主任有意见。有一晚在她厅堂里开的小组会上，大家的意见本已提得差不多了，村主任还再三再四地启发大家说：“提，提，那怕芝麻大的事情都要提！”傅老婆婆坐在不显眼的墙角落，本来在打盹的，一听村主任说的话，好像给火一烫，头一仰，瞅着村主任没好气地说：“提？要提我就对你有意见！”
    原来，今年春上村里拟订生产计划，争取全村增产25％。人人都在那里提保证，傅老婆婆也满心高兴地想提几条保证，可是她一动嘴，便给别人抢先说了。人又多，她又口齿讷讷的，村主任就摇头摆手说：
  “嗨呀，你个老太婆，马虎一点也行吧？”傅老婆婆马上脸一垮，气冲冲地走了。
      “哼，什么作风！”傅老婆婆现在提起这回事，胸口一突一突地好像还在生气似的，“瞧我笨手笨脚，看不起，打击我的积极性！”说得满堂哄笑起来了。
    各组把讨论的情况一汇报，干部和候选人大吃一惊，觉得要不是深入发动了群众来检查，像傅老婆婆这样的意见，谁也不会在意的了。因此才决定开个选民大会，该检讨的要当众检讨，该说明的要耐心说明，希望把会开好。
    会场设在村口小学里。虽然风风雨雨没有停止，去开会的男女，却比平常去看戏还更踊跃。我也拿了伞，走出门，只见傅老婆婆在门口跟儿媳妇斗嘴：
    媳妇说：“娘，积德积德，莫去摇摇摆摆！”
    婆婆说：“我摆我的，你莫管！”
    媳妇说：“风一吹，雨一打，晚上又要倒田螺（咳嗽），何苦啊！”
    旁边也有人插嘴：“是呀，今晚又不选举。”
    傅老婆婆火了，白眼一翻：“你们哪，一鼻孔出气，都瞧我老太婆不起，我就不要听听主任怎么作检讨？”说着，一个劲地向前摆去了。弄得媳妇没奈何，舌头一伸，撵上去搀扶她。
    会从八点钟一直开到十二点。六个候选人，一个接一个谈着，几百个选民鸦雀无声听着，除了台上的讲演声，妇女们怀里的孩子打呼声，以及每当候选人结束讲话时引起的鼓掌声，几乎掉下一根针，都能听到响声。
    我在讲台后边贴墙站着，正对着坐在最前面的傅老婆婆。她静静地望着讲演人的脸，不时眼皮眨呀眨的，眉毛闪呀闪的，还好像吃着蜜糖似地吞着口水。忽然，她望望我，鼻子一缩，嘴一呶，伸个指头悄悄指指台上，忍不住呵呵笑了。她笑什么呢？哦，她笑现在台上作报告的，正是村主任。而且正在检讨他的工作作风急躁，不耐心，就连傅老婆婆的意见，也举出作了例子，说他倾听群众的意见不全面……我也忍不住笑了。
    会散了，人们都心满意足地走出会场。我回到傅老婆婆家里，觉得很疲倦，一进房就睡了。忽听得隔壁楼梯吱吱地响，接着传来楼上不稳健的脚步声。
    “谁呀？”
      “我哟！”出我意外的竟是傅老婆婆。“嗯，翻件把新衣服，明天好去开选举会。人家年轻人，早几天就上街，买这买那，红红绿绿的，都打扮得像个新娘子。我嘛，打扮也是个老太婆，就换上这件士林布的罩褂算了……。”她还在说什么，我已经瞌睡得听不清了。
