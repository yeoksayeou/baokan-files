Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 28th - Xinhua News Agency reporter Yin Chongjing reports: Tianjin, a coastal industrial base that has initially realized its potential, is providing more goods to this year's peak season market than in previous years. By mid-November, the goods supplied to all parts of the country through state-owned commercial departments had already exceeded the original annual supply plan. Among them, the supply of sewing machines, radios, fountain pens, and pencils increased by 50% to three or four times compared with the same period last year, cotton cloth increased by more than 1.4 million bolts, bicycles increased by more than 50,000, and mimeograph machines increased by more than 70,000.

Since the beginning of this year, more than a thousand factories in Tianjin have changed the past situation of insufficient tasks and insufficient operating hours. As of the end of October, the total output value of the Tianjin Municipal Textile Industry Bureau and the First and Second Light Industry Bureaus increased by 23% compared with the same period last year. In the past, many factories only operated one or two shifts per day, but now most have been converted to two or three shifts. The Dongya Flax and Wool Textile Factory, famous for producing Antelope brand cashmere yarn, will increase its annual output by more than five times this year due to the adjustment of machinery and equipment and the improvement of labor organization.

Since the beginning of this year, many factories in Tianjin have carried out renovation, expansion, or added machinery and equipment with little expenditure, and some have already begun to see benefits. Hengyuan Textile Factory, one of China's oldest cotton textile factories, has added 2,400 spindles using old factory buildings this year, and has already spun more than 500 bales of cotton yarn.

Up to now, four of the five local industrial bureaus in Tianjin have completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule, and now many factories under them are still increasing production day and night. It is estimated that by the end of the year, there will be more than 200 million yuan worth of goods to supply to the people of the whole country.

　　天津挖掘工业潜力的结果
　　以更多的商品供应旺季市场
    据新华社天津28日电　新华社记者尹崇敬报道：初步发挥了潜力的沿海工业基地天津市，为今年的旺季市场提供了比往年更多的商品。到11月中旬为止，通过国营商业部门供应给全国各地的商品，已经超过了原订的全年供应计划。其中缝纫机、收音机、钢笔、铅笔等的供应量，比去年同期增加了50％到三、四倍，棉布增加一百四十多万匹，自行车增加五万多辆，油印机增加了七万多架。
    今年以来，天津市上千个工厂改变了过去任务不足、开工不足的情况。截至10月底止，天津市纺织工业局和第一、第二轻工业局的生产总值，比去年同期增加了23％。过去许多厂每天只开一班或两班生产，现在大部分已经改为两班或三班。以生产抵羊牌绒线著名的东亚麻毛纺织厂，今年由于调整了机器设备，改善了劳动组织，全年产量将比去年增加五倍多。
    今年以来，天津市许多工厂在花钱不多的情况下，进行了改建、扩建或增添了机器设备，有的已经开始收到效益。我国最老的棉纺织厂之一的恒源纺织厂，今年利用旧有厂房新增了二千四百枚纱锭，已经多纺出五百多件棉纱。
    到目前为止，天津市五个地方工业局中有四个局提前完成了今年的生产计划，现在它们所属的很多工厂仍夜以继日地增产。估计到年底，还有价值两亿多元的商品，供应给全国人民。
