Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, December 22nd: The full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the Karachi civic welcome meeting on the afternoon of December 21st is as follows:

	Your Excellency Prime Minister, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen:
	I sincerely thank you for such a warm welcome. Since my colleagues and I set foot on the soil of Pakistan yesterday, we have been constantly feeling the friendship of the Pakistani people, a friendship that deeply moves us. We must convey this friendship to the Chinese people. At the same time, please allow me here to pay tribute to you, and through you to the people of Pakistan, in the name of the Chinese government and people!
	Although the People's Republic of China and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan are two young countries, and although most of us are visiting your country for the first time, our peoples began friendly cultural and economic exchanges many centuries ago. In those days when transportation was extremely difficult, scholars from our two countries, undaunted by dangers, crossed deserts and oceans to visit each other. The records they left behind not only evoke memories of our glorious history today, but have also become precious proof of the ancient friendship between us.
	The aggression launched by colonialists against our two peoples hindered the exchanges between our two peoples for a long time. However, in the struggle against colonialism for a common goal, we have also deepened our sympathy for each other. After our two countries achieved independence almost simultaneously, we have had the opportunity to re-establish and develop friendship. Especially since the Bandung Conference, the contacts and exchanges between people from our two countries in various fields have become increasingly frequent. More than two months ago, Prime Minister Suhrawardy's visit to China became an important symbol in the development of our friendly relations. I hope that our visit this time will also help to enhance understanding and friendship between our two countries. Although colonialists still want to hinder our rapprochement, they will never be able to divide and isolate us as they did in the past. The strong friendship of the Pakistani people for the Chinese people that we have received here convinces us that the Chinese people and the Pakistani people must live together more and more friendly day by day.
	The friendship between Pakistan and China not only has a long historical tradition, but also the similar historical fate has determined that we have many common aspirations, which constitute the basis for developing friendly relations between us.
	Due to the long-term oppression by colonialism, our two countries are still very backward economically and culturally today. Therefore, we both demand to rapidly build our countries and get rid of this backward state as soon as possible. On the day we arrived in Karachi, we saw everywhere your people working diligently on construction, saw new houses and new factories. Your efforts to build a new Karachi have left us with an impression and aroused our admiration.
	Mr. Chairman, in your friendly speech, you excessively praised the achievements of the Chinese people in building their motherland. The Chinese people have only just begun planned economic and cultural construction after liberating their country and establishing the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people have made some achievements in the cause of building their motherland, but these achievements are very meager. If we consider the needs of our populous country, they are even more meager. We are still very backward in economic and cultural aspects. In order to completely eliminate the backward state left to us by colonialism, we must make long-term and arduous efforts.
	We Chinese people know from our own experience that it is a very arduous task to build a backward country into a modern country. To achieve success in this area, not only must there be the concerted efforts of the people of the whole country, but there must also be a peaceful international environment. A war can interrupt our work of peaceful construction, and as long as there is a threat of war, we cannot devote all our efforts to construction. We believe that the Pakistani people, who have the same desire to build their own country, share the same desire for lasting world peace as the Chinese people.
	We, together with many Asian and African countries, have won our independence, but the colonialists who ruled us in the past still exist. They are not willing to lose their interests and are still trying to restore their rule by all means. The armed aggression against Egypt most clearly demonstrates this conspiracy. However, the development of the situation in Egypt has also proved that as long as we persist in the struggle and strengthen the solidarity between Asian and African countries, strengthen the solidarity with all peace-loving forces in the world, and persist in resisting aggression, all the conspiracies of the colonialists can be smashed.
	In this regard, we are very pleased to see that the 1955 Bandung Conference played a huge historical role in promoting the friendly unity of Asian and African countries. The Chinese people have a very good evaluation of Pakistan's contribution to participating in initiating this conference and express their deep gratitude.
	Of course, there are still various unresolved issues in the relations between Asian and African countries. These problems are almost all the evil consequences left over from colonial rule. And now, they are trying to use these problems to provoke, divide and weaken Asian and African countries in order to achieve their ulterior motives. We Asian and African countries should be vigilant about such dangers. In order to safeguard the interests of our respective national independence and to safeguard the interests of peace in the Asian-African region and the world, maintaining our friendly unity is of particular importance. According to our experience, as long as we Asian and African countries treat each other with sincerity, there is no problem between us that cannot be resolved through peaceful consultation with each other. When Prime Minister Suhrawardy visited China, we stated in a joint statement that we "are willing to continue to work to promote friendly cooperation between Asian and African countries" and expressed our belief that "as long as there is goodwill and sincerity, no international dispute cannot be resolved by peaceful means." These words accurately express our common desires and beliefs.
	Ladies and gentlemen: The purpose of our visit to Pakistan and other Asian and African countries this time is to bring the Chinese people's desire for peace and friendship to the people of all countries. Wherever we go, we have seen the same desire. Now, here, we have seen the same desire of the Pakistani people again, which gives us great encouragement. We are even more convinced that the cause we are all engaged in—the cause of promoting friendship among Asian and African countries and the cause of safeguarding world peace—will surely be victorious.
	I once again express my gratitude to you. At this friendship-filled meeting, I sincerely wish:
	The friendship between the people of China and Pakistan will develop day by day!
	The unity of Asian and African countries will be consolidated day by day!
	Qin—Ou Wu—Pakistan—Ge—Du Si Di—Jin Da Ba! (Urdu: Long live Sino-Pakistani friendship!)
	Alemmi—Aman—Jin Da Ba! (Urdu: Long live world peace!)

### 周总理在卡拉奇市民欢迎会上的讲话

    周总理在卡拉奇市民欢迎会上的讲话
    新华社卡拉奇22日电　周恩来总理21日下午在卡拉奇市民欢迎会上的讲话全文如下：总理阁下，主席先生，女士们，先生们：
    我衷心地感谢你们这样热烈的欢迎。自从我和我的同事们在昨天踏上巴基斯坦的土地以来，我们就无时不感受到巴基斯坦人民的友情，这种友情使我们深深的感动。我们一定要把这种友情转达给中国人民。同时，请允许我在这里以中国政府和人民的名义向你们，并通过你们向巴基斯坦的人民致敬！
    虽然中华人民共和国和巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国是两个年青的国家，虽然我们中间的大多数人还是第一次访问你们的国家，但是，在许多世纪以前我们的人民之间就开始了文化和经济的友好交流。在那些交通条件十分艰难的日子里，我们两国的学者曾经不怕险阻，越过沙漠和海洋进行了相互的访问，他们所留下来的纪录在今天不但唤起我们对自己的光荣的历史的回忆，而且已成为我们之间古老的友谊的珍贵的证明。
    殖民主义者对我们两国人民发动的侵略，曾经在很长的时间内阻挠了我们两国人民的来往。但是，在反抗殖民主义的共同目的下而进行的斗争中，我们也更加加深了彼此的同情，在我们两国差不多同时取得独立以后，我们已经得到了重新建立和发展友谊的机会。特别是万隆会议以后，我们两国人士在各方面的接触和来往都日益频繁，两个多月以前，苏拉瓦底总理阁下到中国的访问已经成为我们两国友好关系发展中的一个重要标志。我希望，我们这一次的访问也能有助于增进我们两国之间的了解和友谊。殖民主义者虽然还想阻碍我们之间的接近，但是，他们要像过去那样地分裂和隔绝我们是无论如何也办不到了。我们在这里所领受到的巴基斯坦人民对于中国人民的强烈友谊，使我们深信，中国人民和巴基斯坦人民一定要一天比一天更加友好地相处下去。
    巴基斯坦和中国的友谊不但有着悠久的历史传统，而且相似的历史命运也决定了我们之间有许多共同的愿望，构成我们发展友好关系的基础。
    由于同样受到殖民主义的长期压迫，我们两国今天在经济上和文化上还都是十分落后的，因此，我们都要求迅速地建设我们的国家，使它尽早脱离这种落后状态。我们在到达卡拉奇的一天内，到处看到了你们的人民在勤劳地建设，看到了新的住宅和新的工厂。你们为建设一个新的卡拉奇而进行的努力已经给我们留下了印象，并且引起我们的钦佩。
    主席先生，在你的充满友好的发言中，你过分地赞誉了中国人民在建设祖国中所取得的成就。中国人民在解放了自己的国家建立了中华人民共和国以后，才刚刚开始了有计划的经济和文化建设。中国人民在建设祖国的事业中取得了一些成就，但是，这些成就是很微薄的，如果就我们这样的人口众多的国家的需要来说，那就更加微薄，我们在经济和文化方面还很落后。为了彻底消除殖民主义所遗留给我们的落后状态，我们还必须作出长期和艰巨的努力。
    我们中国人民从自己的切身经验中知道，要把一个落后的国家建设成为一个近代化的国家，是一件十分艰巨的事业。要在这方面取得成就，不但必须有全国人民的一致努力，还必须有一个和平的国际环境。一场战争可以中断我们从事和平建设的工作，而且，只要存在着战争的威胁，我们就不能全力进行建设。我们相信，具有同样建设自己的国家的愿望的巴基斯坦人民对于争取持久的世界和平的愿望是同中国人民一致的。
    我们和许多亚非国家在一起已经争得了自己的独立，但是过去统治过我们的殖民主义者还依然存在，他们并不甘心失去自己的利益，而且仍然企图用一切手段来恢复他们的统治。对埃及的武装侵略最明显地表现了这种阴谋。但是，埃及形势的发展也证明了：只要坚持斗争并且加强亚非国家间的团结，加强同世界上一切爱好和平的力量的团结，坚持反抗侵略，殖民主义者一切阴谋都是可以击破的。
    在这方面，我们十分满意的看到1955年的万隆会议在促进亚非国家友好团结方面起了巨大的历史作用。中国人民对于巴基斯坦在参与发起这次会议方面所作出的贡献有很好的评价，并且深表感谢。
    当然，在亚非国家之间的关系中，也还存在着各种悬而未决的问题。这些问题几乎都是殖民主义统治所遗留下来的恶果。而现在，他们就企图利用这些问题来挑拨、分裂和削弱亚非国家，以便达到自己不可告人的目的。我们亚非国家应该警惕到这样的危险。为了保卫我们各自的国家独立的利益，为了维护亚非地区和世界和平的利益，保持我们之间的友好团结是具有特殊重要的意义的。按照我们的经验，我们亚非国家只要相见以诚，我们之间的问题是没有不可以通过彼此和平协商的道路求得解决的，苏拉瓦底总理阁下到中国访问的时候，我们曾经在一次联合声明中表示“愿意为促进亚非各国之间的友好合作而继续努力”，并且表示相信：“只要具有善意和诚意，没有任何国际争端不能用和平方式加以解决”。这些话确切的表达了我们共同的愿望和信念。
    女士们，先生们：我们这次到巴基斯坦和其他亚非国家进行访问，目的就是要把中国人民对和平和友好的愿望带给各国人民，我们在我们所到的地方，都看到了同样的愿望。现在，在这里，我们又看到了巴基斯坦人民的同样的愿望，这个事实使我们得到了很大的鼓舞。我们更加深信，我们大家所共同从事的事业——促进亚非各国友好的事业，维护世界和平的事业一定会胜利的。
    我再一次向你们表示感谢，在这个友情洋溢的大会上，我谨祝：
    中国和巴基斯坦的两国人民的友谊一天比一天发展！
    祝亚非国家的团结一天比一天巩固！
    秦—欧勿—巴基斯坦—格—独斯地—津达巴！（乌尔都文：中巴友好万岁）
    阿勒迷—阿曼—津达巴！（乌尔都文：世界和平万岁）
