    Leading Party and Government Cadres of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    Conduct In-depth Investigations and Research in Rural and Pastoral Areas
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Autonomous Region People's Committee will dispatch nearly a hundred cadres to rural and pastoral areas around the 10th of this month to work. Among the personnel going to the countryside are many leading cadres, including secretaries and members of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and vice chairmen and department heads of the Autonomous Region People's Committee. They will go deep among the masses, delve into reality, strengthen the work of investigation and research, help cooperatives in various places do a good job in autumn harvest distribution, ensure that the vast majority of members increase their income, and further rectify and consolidate cooperatives; and further implement the policy of protecting and developing animal husbandry production, reverse the current situation of farmers and herdsmen slaughtering and selling large numbers of livestock. In addition, they will also conscientiously solve the problem of a large reduction in income for ethnic minorities in some ethnic joint cooperatives, in order to benefit ethnic unity.
