Xinhua News Agency Report:

　　Over the past year and this year, more than 370,000 immigrants have come to the Great Northern Wilderness (北大荒). Through their hard work over the past year, they have harvested nearly 280 million jin of grain on the 140,000 hectares of newly reclaimed wasteland. The average agricultural and sideline income per person in most new immigrant villages is over 200 yuan, and in many new villages, the average income per person can reach over 400 yuan.

　　The construction of new villages has seen great development, with 452 new villages established this year alone. Currently, 25,000 houses have been built in the immigrant areas of Heilongjiang Province. The variety of staple foods for the immigrants has also increased, and they can generally eat vegetables, and have thick winter clothes and shoes. Recently, counties in Heilongjiang Province have also prepared to mobilize local agencies and schools to voluntarily donate cultural and recreational equipment to help enrich the cultural and recreational life of the new villages.

　　Since the autumn, due to increased state investment in immigrant reclamation work and assistance in bringing family members to some immigrants, the immigrants feel that the new villages are full of life. In particular, this year's bumper harvest has given the vast number of immigrants a deep affection for the new villages. Thanks to the constant care for the immigrants by Party organizations and governments at all levels, their enthusiasm for labor has been greatly enhanced, and many production experts and model figures have emerged. Three new villages in Bei'an County have trained 120 farm tool technicians. In Longjiang County alone, 94 models have emerged from sideline production teams. Some immigrants said that the state cares about us so much and spends so much money on land reclamation, we must work hard.

　　Recently, Heilongjiang Province held an immigration work conference to specifically plan how to carry out winter production and production preparations for next year, as well as various measures to help immigrants survive the cold winter. The Provincial Department of Civil Affairs has sent more than 80 cadres to key immigrant counties to help carry out this work.

    三十七万移民　安家黑龙江省
    新华社讯　去年和今年共有三十七万多移民来到了北大荒。他们经过一年多来的辛勤劳动，已经在新开垦的十四万公顷荒地上收获了近两亿八千万斤粮食。多数移民新村平均每人农业和副业收入在二百元以上，也有不少新村平均每人收入能达到四百元以上。
    新村建设有了巨大的发展，仅今年就建立了四百五十二个新村。目前黑龙江省移民地区已经盖好两万五千间房屋。移民们的口粮品种也有了增加，他们普遍都能吃上蔬菜，并且穿上了厚厚的冬衣和鞋帽。最近黑龙江省各县还准备发动当地机关和学校等自愿捐助文化娱乐用具，帮助新村活跃文化娱乐生活。
    入秋以来，由于国家对移民垦荒工作增加了投资，又帮助部分移民接来家属，使移民感到新村里充满了生活气息。特别是今年丰收，广大移民都对新村有了深厚的感情。由于各级党组织和政府经常关心移民，大大提高了他们的劳动积极性，出现了不少生产能手和模范人物。北安县三个新村已经培养出一百二十名农具手。龙江县移民仅副业生产队就出现了九十四个模范，有的移民说，国家这样关心咱们，拿这么多钱搞垦荒，我们一定要好好地干。
    最近，黑龙江省召开移民工作会议，具体地布置了如何开展冬季生产和明年的生产准备工作，以及帮助移民度过寒冬的各项措施。省民政厅已经派了八十多个干部到移民重点县去帮助开展这些工作。
