Xinhua News Agency, December 6th, New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly held plenary sessions on the morning and afternoon of December 5th, resuming the general debate that had been interrupted due to the discussion of the so-called "Hungarian question."

    Hungarian Foreign Minister Horvath said in his speech that the main factor in the current international tension is the aggressive attitude of certain Western countries, especially the aggression of Britain and France against Egypt.
    Horvath then said that the main problem facing the United Nations is the issue of disarmament. The new Soviet proposals have made a significant contribution to solving this problem. Hungary would like to see the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. What is needed is a collective security treaty that unites all the peoples of Europe on the basis of coexistence. As for the issue of German reunification, this should be resolved through direct negotiations.
    Horvath concluded by saying that Hungary unconditionally respects the rights of other countries in its foreign relations, and in return, it demands the same respect.
    Ukrainian Foreign Minister Palamarchuk also supported the Soviet disarmament proposals, pointing out that it was a "broad and comprehensive plan." He said: Although the Soviet Union is constantly reducing its armed forces, the United States is busy engaging in an arms race, which is "a goose that lays golden eggs for American monopoly capital." The United States has become the "supervisor" of military activities in many countries.
    Syrian representative Zeineddine focused on the Middle East issue and Syria's policy. He said that today, the Middle East issue has become the focus of world tension to a greater extent than ever before. This tension poses a challenge to the United Nations. He pointed out that the troops of Britain, France, and Israel are still concentrated in the Middle East.
      "Given the continued existence of Anglo-Franco-Zionist colonialism, it may still be necessary to consider international sanctions."
    Zeineddine said that now, Syria seems to be next on the invasion timetable. He condemned the imperialist countries' attempts to stem the historical tide of national liberation movements with preemptive wars.
    Zeineddine concluded by saying that Syria's policy is a policy of striving for national liberation. Syria's policy "has always been, and remains, a policy of non-alignment between the two blocs and forces of the Cold War. That is a policy of positive neutrality."
    Canadian representative Pinard, in his speech, called for the admission of more countries as members of the United Nations, especially Japan. Regarding the Middle East issue, he expressed his support for the United Nations Emergency Force and believed that the United Nations should establish an institution capable of taking immediate "police action" to deal with other emergencies in the future.
    Pinard expressed doubt about the sincerity of the Soviet disarmament proposals, but he said that Canada is still prepared to study these proposals within the United Nations.
    He supported the plan put forward by Norway at the General Assembly last week, which stipulates the establishment of a United Nations registry for nuclear test explosions. He explained that, "I believe that immediately prohibiting all such tests is 'neither necessary nor realistic'." However, one should not ignore the possibility of future radioactive hazards.
    The General Assembly will continue the general debate on the 6th.

　　联大继续进行一般性辩论
　　匈叙等国代表斥责英法在中东制造紧张局势
    新华社6日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会12月5日上午和下午举行全体会议，重新开始由于讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”而中断的一般性辩论。
    匈牙利外交部长霍瓦特在发言中说，目前国际局势紧张的主要因素是某些西方国家的侵略态度，特别是英、法两国对埃及的侵略。
    霍瓦特接着说，联合国面临的主要问题是裁军问题。苏联的新建议对解决这个问题作出了重大的贡献。匈牙利愿意看到解散华沙条约和北大西洋公约。需要的是一项在共处基础上团结欧洲全体人民的集体安全条约。至于统一德国的问题，这应该通过直接谈判来解决。
    霍瓦特最后说，匈牙利在对外关系中无条件地尊重其他国家的权利，反过来，它也要求同样的尊重。
    乌克兰外交部长帕拉马尔楚克也支持苏联的裁军建议，指出这是一个“广泛而全面的计划”。他说：虽然苏联不断地裁减它的武装部队，但是美国却在忙于进行军备竞赛，这是“替美国垄断资本生金蛋的鹅”。美国已经成为许多国家中军事活动的“总监”。
    叙利亚代表宰尼丁着重谈到中东问题和叙利亚的政策。他说，在今天，中东问题成为世界紧张局势的焦点的程度比过去任何时候都要大。这种紧张局势使联合国面临着一种挑战。他指出，英、法和以色列三国军队目前仍然继续集中在中东。
      “鉴于英—法—犹太复国主义殖民主义继续存在，也许仍然有必要考虑国际制裁”。
    宰尼丁说，现在，叙利亚好像排在被侵略的时间表上了。他谴责帝国主义国家企图用先发制人的战争来堵住民族解放运动的历史潮流。
    宰尼丁最后说，叙利亚的政策是争取民族解放的政策。叙利亚的政策“一向是，而且仍然是在冷战的两个阵营和势力之间不承担义务的政策。那是积极的中立政策。”
    加拿大代表皮纳德在发言中要求接纳更多的国家为联合国会员国，特别是日本。谈到中东问题，他表示支持联合国紧急部队，并且认为联合国应该设立一个能够立即采取“警察行动”的机构，以便在今后应付其他的紧急问题。
    皮纳德表示怀疑苏联的裁军建议的诚意，但是他说，加拿大仍然准备在联合国中研究这些建议。
    他支持挪威上星期在大会上提出的计划，这个计划规定设立一个核子试验性爆炸的联合国登记处。他解释说，我认为，打算对所有这种试验立即加以禁止是“既不必要又不现实的”。但是，人们也不应当忽视将来产生放射性危险的可能性。
    大会将在6日继续进行一般性辩论。
