    “Everybody Happy”
    In early November, the Fuzhou Civil Affairs Bureau convened a meeting of grassroots civil affairs cadres. The meeting organizer invited more than 700 representatives attending the meeting to watch a Min opera, and also bought special-class tickets for more than 300 cadres from units such as the Provincial Civil Affairs Department and the Municipal People's Committee to "attend and accompany." Those who couldn't see the opera that night could make it up the second night, so both large and small cadres were "everybody happy."
    Did these comrades think, in their "everybody happy" moment, that this money was actually deducted from preferential treatment funds? If they did think of that, would they still be "happy" as usual? (Lin Feng)

    “皆大欢喜”
    11月初，福州市民政局召开基层民政干部会议。会议主持者请参加会议的七百多个代表看闽剧，而另给省民政厅、市人民委员会等单位三百多个干部买了特等票“列席作陪”。那晚看不到戏的。第二晚还可补看，于是大小干部“皆大欢喜”。
    这些同志在“皆大欢喜”中是否想到这笔钱竟是从优抚金里扣出来的。如果想到的话，是不是还会照样“欢喜”呢？（林峰）
