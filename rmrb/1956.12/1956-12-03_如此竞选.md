    Such a Campaign
    Republican Willis Go Holt, who ran for mayor of Jefferson City, Tennessee, failed. He placed the following advertisement in the local newspaper:
      “I wasted weeks trying to persuade people to vote for me. I lost several acres of corn and potatoes. I gave away two calves and five sheep for people to eat. I gave away five pairs of stockings, six women's dresses, and fifteen baby whistles. I plowed one hundred and seventy-three acres of land for voters and spread thirteen carts of fertilizer. I carried twenty-four buckets of water, installed fourteen kitchen stoves, lit seventeen fires, and kissed one hundred and fifteen babies. I traveled six thousand four hundred and eighty-one miles and shook hands nine thousand eight hundred and forty-seven times. The amount of talking I did could be bound into several thick books. In a personal argument with a supporter of the opposition party, I had two front teeth knocked out and some hair pulled out. I attended twenty-six campaign rallies, flirted with nine widows, and got bitten by dogs thirty-nine times. But, friends, I still failed.”

    如此竞选
    美国共和党的比利斯果·荷尔特，在田纳西州杰斐逊市参加竞选市长的候选人，结果失败了。他在当地的报章上登了这样的广告：
      “我白费了几个星期的时间，去劝说人家投我的票。我赔了好几亩的玉米和土豆。我送了两只小牛、五只羊给人家拿去吃掉。我送掉了五双吊袜带、六件妇女服装和十五件婴儿玩的哨子。我替投票人耕了一百七十三亩地，散播了十三车肥料。我挑过二十四桶水，安置了十四具厨房的炉灶，点燃过十七处火种，跟一百一十五个婴儿接过吻。我走了六千四百八十一英里路，握过九千八百四十七次的手。说话的数量，可以装订成好几本厚册的书。在我个人跟一个支持反对党的人的争执中，我给打掉了两颗门牙和几根头发。我参加过二十六次的竞选宣传会议，跟九个寡妇谈过爱，还给狗咬了三十九次。可是，朋友，我仍然失败了。”
