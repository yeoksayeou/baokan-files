　　What "Contribution"

　　On December 5th, U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Burke shamelessly said that the U.S. Sixth Fleet stationed in the Mediterranean had made a "tremendous contribution" to peace in the Middle East. Then, he pretended to be modest and said that the extent of this "contribution" should be "determined by future historians."

　　In fact, why wait for "future historians"? Today, every Egyptian and Arab has personally seen what the U.S. Sixth Fleet's "contribution" in the Mediterranean is. After Egypt announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, the Sixth Fleet immediately increased its forces and concentrated in the eastern Mediterranean, displaying its "deterrent force" to intimidate the Egyptian people who insisted on national sovereignty. When the British and French colonialists mobilized troops and launched armed aggression against Egypt, the Sixth Fleet not only did not stop it, but also established "contact" with the British and French "special fleets," while adding two aircraft carriers with atomic bombers to conduct some kind of "combat readiness." It was under the encouragement of the Sixth Fleet that the British and French colonialists ignited the flames of war in the Middle East, causing Egypt's peaceful cities, ports, hospitals, schools, and monasteries to be savagely bombed, and many innocent people were massacred. This is the Sixth Fleet's "contribution" to peace in the Middle East! Moreover, even now, the Sixth Fleet continues to create tension in the Mediterranean and intimidate the Arab people. On December 10th, Sixth Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Brown openly said: The U.S. Navy is a "diplomatic force" that can make a "sound" in international affairs, "and when necessary, the navy can raise its voice—or it can roar." This is a self-confession: the United States sent its Sixth Fleet to the Mediterranean, thousands of miles away, to stir up trouble there and achieve its "diplomatic" (read: aggressive) goals. This is the Sixth Fleet's "contribution" to peace in the Middle East! (Hou)

### 什么“贡献”

    什么“贡献”
    12月5日，美国海军作战部部长伯克海军上将大言不惭地说，美国驻在地中海的第六舰队对于中东和平作了“巨大的贡献”。接着，他又装作谦虚地说，至于这个“贡献”究竟有多么大，要由“未来的历史家去决定”。
    其实，又何必等待“未来的历史家”呢？今天每一个埃及人和阿拉伯人都亲眼看到美国第六舰队在地中海的“贡献”是什么。在埃及宣布把苏伊士运河公司收归国有以后，第六舰队立即增加了兵力，并且集中到地中海东部，显示它的“威慑力量”，来恐吓坚持民族主权的埃及人民。当英法殖民者调兵遣将，武装侵犯埃及的时候，第六舰队不但不去制止，反而和英法的“特种舰队”建立了“联系”，同时增加了两艘带原子轰炸机的航空母舰，进行什么“战斗准备”。就在第六舰队这种鼓励下，英法殖民者在中东燃起了战火，使埃及的和平城市、港口、医院、学校、寺院遭到了野蛮的轰炸，许多无辜人民被屠杀了。这就是第六舰队对中东和平的“贡献”！而且，直到现在，第六舰队还在地中海继续制造紧张局势，恐吓阿拉伯人民。12月10日，第六舰队司令布朗海军中将公开说：美国海军是一支能够在国际局势中发出“声浪”的“外交力量”，“在必要时，海军能够提高它的声浪——或者说它能怒吼起来”。真是不打自招：美国把它的第六舰队派驻在千万里之遥的地中海，就是为了在那里兴风作浪，来达到它的“外交”（读作侵略）目的。这就是第六舰队对中东和平的“贡献”！（厚）
