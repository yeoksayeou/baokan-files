    The Hem of the Hegemon's Garment

    The United States is extensively propagating the idea that Britain should submit to it. A dispatch from the "Wall Street Journal's" London correspondent, published on the front page, extravagantly boasts of America's hegemonic position among Western powers while deriding Britain, saying, "The stark reality is that without the United States, Britain cannot survive."

    The reporter also seems to have solid grounds for saying that British foreign policymakers have concluded that Britain "must tightly clutch Uncle Sam's garment hem."

    The "New York Times" also reported with ulterior motives that influential figures in Britain believe that "Britain absolutely cannot have a Prime Minister who does not maintain the best relations with the President (referring to the US President)."

    What is the purpose of this extremely acrimonious propaganda against Britain?

    The "Wall Street Journal" reporter revealed the truth. He said with a threatening tone that it should be recognized that the United States has a stronger position in formulating solutions for the Middle East. In other words, Britain should no longer fuss and should obediently allow the United States to dispose of its colonial interests in the Middle East.

    United Press reporter Hansley said more bluntly that Washington intends "to fill the power vacuum left after Paris and London lost strength and prestige due to the unfortunate Suez adventure." However, this reporter is concerned that the United States has a big problem: how can it both persist in this policy of replacing Britain and France and avoid "alienating" some of its European allies?

    Obviously, the propaganda offensive launched by the American propaganda machine against Britain is to force Britain to submit, to avoid this "alienation."

    Does Britain necessarily have to clutch tightly at the hem of Washington's hegemon's garment to survive? The answer lies in whether Britain still intends to rely on the United States to maintain its own colonial interests. The adventure in Egypt has proven that this policy can only bankrupt itself and then be more helplessly held in the hands of the United States.

### 盟主的衣服的下摆

    盟主的衣服的下摆
    美国正在大量地宣传英国应该屈从美国。“华尔街日报”在首页发表的驻伦敦记者写的消息，就大肆夸耀美国在西方大国中的盟主地位，同时奚落英国说：“赤裸裸的事实是，没有美国，英国就不能生存。”
    这个记者还似乎有根有据地说，英国的外交决策者已经得出结论：英国“必须紧紧地扯住山姆大叔的衣服下摆”。
      “纽约时报”也别有用心地报道说，英国有势力的人士认为，“英国万万不能有一个不同总统（指美国总统）维持最良好的关系的首相”。
    这种对英国的刻薄至极的宣传，目的何在呢？
    “华尔街日报”的记者透露了真相。他带着威胁性的口吻，认为应该承认这样的事实：美国在拟制中东的解决办法上，有着更强有力的地位。也就是说，英国不应再吵吵闹闹，而应乖乖地把自己在中东的殖民利益听凭美国摆布。
    合众社记者汉斯莱说得更露骨，他说：华盛顿已经打算“把由于巴黎和伦敦进行不幸的苏伊士冒险而丧失力量和威信以后留下的势力范围的真空地带填满。”但是，这个记者担心，美国有一个大问题是，它怎样才能既坚持这种取代英法的政策，而又不同它的欧洲的某些盟国“疏远”。
    很显然，美国宣传机关对英国发动的宣传攻势，就是要叫英国屈服，来避免这种“疏远”。
    英国是不是一定要扯紧华盛顿盟主的衣服的下摆，才能活下去呢？问题的答案在于英国是否仍然打算依靠美国来维持自己的殖民利益。对埃及的冒险证明，这种政策只能使自己破产，然后更加无力地被美国抓在手中。
