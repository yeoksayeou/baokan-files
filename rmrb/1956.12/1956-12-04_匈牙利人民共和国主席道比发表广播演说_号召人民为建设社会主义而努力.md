Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 2nd: According to TASS, Dobi, Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, delivered a radio address to Hungarian farmers, workers, and intellectuals on the evening of December 1st.

Dobi said that the sound of gunfire has gradually ceased, and now we should look around our country to see what losses it has suffered and what its current tasks are.

    Criticizes Activities Inciting Strikes

The cities, mainly Budapest, have suffered great losses, and the people have also suffered disasters. Thousands of families have suffered losses. Many families have been broken and lost their lives.

Dobi then talked about the widespread assistance Hungary has received from abroad. He said that Hungarians cannot rest easy because of this assistance, and residents of all strata should actively and resolutely work hard.

Dobi continued, "The fighting is over, but counter-revolutionary forces in Budapest and some industrial centers have been carrying out incitement against resumption of work and against the people's power for several weeks. This incitement is still going on sporadically. For several days, the restoration work of hospitals, nurseries, and residences in Budapest could not be started immediately, which is the most inhumane proof of this kind of incitement." Dobi called on everyone to work resolutely and tenaciously for the happiness of society and the country. Dobi said that because the enemies of the people's power have had to admit that their political goals are difficult to achieve, they continue to implement a policy of strikes to achieve their destructive goals. Unfortunately, many irresponsible people with right-leaning ideas or those hostile to socialism are at the forefront of this movement.

    Supports the Agricultural Cooperative System

Dobi said that it is necessary to correct the mistakes made in the past during the Rakosi-Gero era in developing the cooperative form of agricultural management.

Dobi pointed out that some writers, journalists, and others who went to the countryside actively incited farmers to strike. However, there was not a single place in the country where a farmer strike desired by the followers of the counter-revolution occurred. Tense harvesting, plowing, and sowing work is being carried out everywhere.

The fact that the cooperative system is much more solid than many people imagine is also a good lesson for everyone. The worker-peasant revolutionary government has passed a series of resolutions to help farmers in a timely manner. The government will create conditions for those farmers who want to engage in small-scale farming so that they can operate peacefully and without hindrance. The worker-peasant regime will help them develop their economy.

Dobi said, "We are building socialism in the cities and also building socialism in the countryside. Cooperativization is one of the forms of building socialism in the countryside. The worker-peasant regime will continue to support the cooperative societies that have been preserved and rebuilt in the future. Therefore, I ask the members of the cooperative societies to work with confidence, believe in the future, and see that they can get full help from the country when necessary."

    Calls on Those Who Have Wandered Abroad to Return Home

Dobi said, "Finally, I would like to talk briefly about those who have left Hungary in these tense days. Some of them are not worth pitying, and those countries that are accommodating them will not be happy because they arrived there. Some of them originally ran from the West to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. This part of the people committed great crimes in the motherland and left the motherland in order to escape due punishment. We do not pity another part of the people who left Hungary either. In fact, they have never regarded our country as their own motherland, especially after the capitalist system was overthrown."

"I call on those who are suffering from wandering and displacement, suffering from wind and rain, and who have woken up because of wandering abroad and suffering misfortune to return home. I call on these people to return home with loving care, come back and work with us for the happiness of our country and our people. In this country, there will never be inhumane methods of violent politics again. The disaster will be calmed down, people's hearts will be settled, and we will start working. Our life will be built according to our wishes. We will build socialism, be friendly with our socialist neighbors, and also be friendly with Western countries, with all countries that accept our friendship on the principle of equality."

### 匈牙利人民共和国主席道比发表广播演说  号召人民为建设社会主义而努力

    匈牙利人民共和国主席道比发表广播演说
    号召人民为建设社会主义而努力
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社布达佩斯2日讯：匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席道比1日晚间对匈牙利农民、工人和知识分子发表了广播演说。
    道比说，炮声已经逐渐停了下来，现在应该环顾我们的国家，看看它遭到了什么样的损失以及它的当前任务是什么。
    指责煽动罢工的活动
    各城市，主要是布达佩斯遭到了很大的损失，而人民也遭到了灾难。成千的家庭受到损失。许多人家破人亡。
    道比接着谈到匈牙利得到国外的广泛的援助。他说，匈牙利人不能因为有了这些援助就高枕无忧，各阶层的居民应该积极地和坚毅地努力工作。
    道比继续说，战斗已经结束了，而反革命势力在布达佩斯和一些工业中心还进行了几星期反对复工和反对人民政权的煽动。这种煽动到现在还在零星地进行着。有好几天布达佩斯的医院、托儿所、住宅的恢复工作都不能马上开始，这就是这种煽动行为的最无人性的明证。道比号召大家为社会和国家的幸福而坚毅和顽强地劳动。道比说，由于人民政权的敌人不得不承认他们的政治目的难以实现，他们就继续实行罢工的政策，以达到他们破坏的目的。遗憾的是，许多有右倾思想的不负责任的人或对社会主义怀有敌意的人都站在这一运动的前面。
    支持农业合作社制度
    道比说，必须纠正在过去拉科西—格罗时期在发展农业的合作制经营形式方面所犯的错误。
    道比指出，有些到乡下去的作家、新闻记者以及其他一些人积极地煽动农民起来罢工。但是，在全国没有一个地方发生了为反革命追随者所渴望的农民罢工。到处都在进行着紧张的收割、耕耘和播种工作。
    合作社制度比许多人所想像的要巩固得多，这一事实对所有的人来说也是一个很好的教训。工农革命政府通过了一系列的决议，及时地去帮助农民。政府将为那些想进行小农经营的农民创造条件，使他们能够平安地、不受阻碍地经营。工农政权将帮助他们发展他们的经济。
    道比说，我们既在城市里建设社会主义，也在农村建设社会主义。合作化是在农村建设社会主义的形式之一。工农政权今后仍将支持保存下来的和重建起来的合作社。因此，我请求合作社社员们有信心地从事劳动、相信未来，并且看到：在必要时，他们可以得到国家的全面帮助。
    号召流落国外的人回国
    道比说，最后我想简单地谈谈那些在这些紧张的日子里离开匈牙利的人。其中有一部分人是不值得怜悯的，收容他们的那些国家不会因为他们到达那里而感到高兴。他们当中有一部分人本是从西方跑来搞反革命活动的。这一部分人在祖国犯了大罪，为了逃避应有的惩罚而离开祖国。关于离开匈牙利的另一部分人，我们也不怜惜他们，他们实际上一直没有、特别是在资本主义制度被推翻之后更没有把我国看作是自己的祖国。
    我号召那些苦于流浪失所、身受风吹雨打，因流落国外、身遭不幸而清醒过来的人回国。我以爱护的心情号召这些人回国、回国吧，来同我们一起为我们国家和我国人民的幸福而工作。在这个国家，永远也不会再出现无人性的暴力政策的方法。灾难将平定下来，人心将安定，我们将开始工作。我们的生活将按照我们的心愿建设。我们将建设社会主义，同我们的社会主义邻国友好，也同西方国家、同一切在平等的原则上接受我们的友谊的国家友好。
