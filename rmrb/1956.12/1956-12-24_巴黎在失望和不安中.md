Paris in Disappointment and Unease
　　Yuan Xianlu

Christmas is approaching. However, in Paris, known as "prosperous as a dream," people see not joy and delight, but a scene of disappointment and unease.

　　Gasoline Unavailable

On December 17th, eight days before the holiday, the French Ministry of Finance raised the prices of liquid fuels. Gasoline rose by 9%, selling for 73 francs per liter.

In reality, the black market price of gasoline in Paris had already run ahead. In the December 7th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, an American living in the suburbs of Paris complained, "I can't even buy gasoline on the black market for $1.71 a gallon (equivalent to about 150 francs per liter)."

To buy gasoline at the official price is really a difficult task. The American mentioned above who wanted to buy black market gasoline had gone to fifty-four gas stations, but only three of them were open; and to buy gasoline, one had to queue for one to three hours.

The December 3rd issue of the American "Time" magazine had a passage describing the gasoline rush in Paris: "Gas stations are always surrounded by noisy private car owners who try every means to fill the tanks of their cars and the oil drums they bring. When the government banned the use of containers other than car tanks to buy gasoline, they used rubber tubes to suck the oil out of the car tanks, put it into containers at home, and then went to the gas station to buy more oil.

The staff at the gas stations, annoyed by the noise, stipulated an informal restriction that each customer could only buy ten liters (about two and a half gallons) of gasoline. This also could not deter those private car owners. They took turns going to three or four gas stations to fill a tank of oil. In Paris, there are at least forty or fifty cars queuing in front of each gas pump at dawn; by noon, the pumps are empty."

The number of private cars and taxis on the streets has been greatly reduced. As a result, buses and subways are overcrowded, raising concerns about major accidents. Many working people in Paris live in the suburbs far from the city center, and they can only sigh at the sight of the buses every day when they go to and from work.

　　Heating Becomes a Problem

In Paris, the temperature has long dropped below freezing. Because the consumption of electricity, gas, and coal has been restricted, heating has also become a serious problem.

Some of the world-renowned luxury hotels in Paris are unbearably cold due to insufficient heating and only provide a few hours of lukewarm "hot water" in the morning.

As for ordinary people, they can only endure the cold. Workers work in cold workshops, civil servants work in cold offices, and children study in cold classrooms. When they return home, they still cannot enjoy any warmth. The December 10th issue of the American "Newsweek" wrote: "In some houses and apartments, families are wrapped in coats and sweaters, but they are still shivering with cold."

　　Threat of Unemployment

The threat of layoffs and unemployment is also getting closer and closer.

With less gasoline, the cars produced cannot be sold. The British "Economist" magazine pointed out as early as November 24th that in some regions of France, "Some customers who have already paid deposits are even hesitating whether to take the cars from the dealers. Last year, there were increasingly difficult signs in the medium and large vehicle market, and now, '...the reduction in fuel consumption has made these difficulties concrete.'"

Not long ago, Simca, the second largest and fastest-growing car company in France, announced the layoff of 1,300 workers and implemented incomplete working days in all its factories. This is just a prelude to large-scale layoffs. According to Agence France-Presse, because the crisis in the automotive industry will directly and indirectly affect the jobs of 200,000 people, French Finance Minister Ramadier and others are studying countermeasures, preparing to take measures such as relaxing installment payment methods for purchasing cars, establishing special "winter sales," and allocating a certain amount of gasoline to new car buyers to encourage people to buy cars. However, despite the news of oil aid coming from across the Atlantic, the best hope can only be to allow important industrial sectors to maintain fuel for production, and gasoline for private vehicles is simply impossible to solve. Since this is the case, aren't the so-called "measures" decided by those ministers just empty talk?

The problem is not only happening in the automotive industry. The steel industry is preparing to reduce production by 400,000 tons in the coming year, and industries such as cement, glass, construction, papermaking, and aluminum manufacturing are also reducing production. The railway department has stopped the operation of locomotives powered by heavy oil... In these departments, employees are worried about whether they will be laid off.

　　Panic Buying of Daily Necessities

In mid-December, the people of Paris saw a new style of 10,000-franc banknotes issued by the Bank of France. This made the people of Paris anticipate the terrible prospect of inflation and soaring prices.

The concerns of the people of Paris are not superfluous. Recently, prices in Paris have been rising.

In order to fear that banknotes will become increasingly worthless, a panic buying of daily necessities has appeared in Paris. Both the American "Time" magazine and "Newsweek" reported that Parisian housewives, recalling the shortage of materials during World War II, felt uneasy and flocked to the markets and grocery stores, vying to buy soap, candles, rice, canned food, salt, and sugar.

Not long ago, French Finance Minister Ramadier announced that salt and sugar shortages had already appeared, and he attributed the responsibility to the panic buying of housewives.

French Prime Minister Mollet also grumbled and complained about ordinary French people, saying that they were not calm enough and lacked discipline, leading to "a new wave of fear." But whose fault is this? The ordinary people of France know, and Prime Minister Mollet certainly knows as well.

    巴黎在失望和不安中
    袁先禄
    圣诞节快到了。可是，在被称为“繁华如梦”的巴黎，人们看到的不是欣喜和欢愉，却是一片失望和不安。
    汽油买不到
    12月17日，节日的前八天，法国财政部规定的液体燃料的价格都提高了。汽油涨了9％，每公升售价七十三个法郎。
    实际上，巴黎的汽油黑市价格早已跑到前面去了。在12月7日的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志上，一个住在巴黎郊区的美国人抱怨地写道：“我甚至不能以美金一元七角一加仑的价钱（折合每公升约一百五十法郎）在黑市上买到汽油。”
    要按官价买到汽油，真是煞非容易的事情。上述的这个想买黑市汽油的美国人，就曾先后到五十四个汽车加油站去买油，但是其中只有三个汽车加油站营业；而要买到汽油，还得排队一个小时到三个小时。
    在12月3日的美国“时代”周刊上，对巴黎抢购汽油的情况有过一段这样的描写：“汽车加油站总是被吵嚷不休的私人汽车所有主包围着，他们想尽办法要把自己车上的油箱和带来的油筒装满。当政府禁止用汽车油箱以外的容器来买油之后，他们就用橡皮管把汽车油箱里的油吸出来，装到家里的容器里，然后再到汽车加油站去买更多的油。
    汽车加油站里被吵得发烦的工作人员规定了一项非正式的限制，每个顾客只许买十公升（约二加仑半）汽油。这同样也难不倒那些私人汽车所有主们。他们轮流到三、四个汽车加油站去装满一油箱的油。在巴黎，天刚亮每个加油机面前就至少有四、五十辆汽车在排队；一到中午，加油机就空了。”
    大街上的私人汽车和出租汽车已经大大减少了。于是，公共汽车和地下电车就拥挤不堪，令人担心要发生重大事故。巴黎有不少劳动人民住在离市区很远的郊外，他们每天上班、下班，都要望车而兴叹。
    取暖成了问题
    在巴黎，气温早就下降到冰点以下。因为电力、煤气和煤的消费已经实行限制，取暖也已经成了一个严重的问题。
    巴黎的一些世界闻名的豪华旅馆，因为暖气不足而冷不可耐，而且每天只在上午供应几个小时不冷不热的“热水”。
    至于普通人，那就只有挨冻的份了。工人们在冰冷的车间里做工，公务人员们在冰冷的办公室里办公，孩子们在冰冷的教室里念书。当他们回到家里以后，仍然享受不到什么温暖。12月10日的美国“新闻周刊”写道：“在一些住宅和公寓里，一家老少身上都裹了外衣和羊毛衫，但还是冷得发抖。”
    失业的威胁
    解雇和失业的威胁，也已经越来越逼近了。
    汽油少，生产出来的汽车就卖不掉。英国“经济学家”杂志早在11月24日就指出：在法国某些地区，
  “有些已经付了定钱的顾客甚至也在犹豫是否要从代理商那里把汽车取走。去年，在中型和大型车辆市场上就有困难越来越多的迹象，现在，“……用油量的削减就使这些困难具体化了。”
    不久以前，法国第二家最大的也是发展最快的西姆卡汽车公司就宣布解雇一千三百名工人，并且在它所属的各个工厂都实行不完全工作日。这只是大规模解雇的一个先声。据法新社报道，因为汽车工业的危机将直接和间接影响二十万人的工作，因此法国财政部长拉马第埃等正在研究对策，准备采取放宽购买汽车的分期付款办法、建立特别的“冬季大减价”和分配一定量的汽油给新车购买者等等措施来鼓励人们买车。但是，尽管大西洋彼岸已经传来了实施石油援助的消息，然而最好的希望也只能让重要的工业部门得到维持生产的燃料，私人车辆用的汽油根本不可能解决。情况既然是这样，那些部长先生们决定的所谓“措施”，岂不是一场空谈而已。
    问题还不仅仅发生在汽车工业。钢铁工业准备在今后一年内减产四十万吨，水泥、玻璃、建筑、造纸、制铝、机械等工业部门也都要缩减生产，铁路部门已经停止了用重油发动的机车的行驶……。在这些部门里，从业人员们都在为自己是否会被解雇而感到忧虑。
    抢购日用品
    12月中旬，巴黎的人民看到了法兰西银行发行的一种新样式的票面一万法郎的钞票。这使巴黎人民预感到通货膨胀和物价飞涨的可怕前景。
    巴黎人民的担心并不是多余的。最近以来，巴黎的物价就一直在上涨。
    为了怕纸币越来越不值钱，巴黎已经出现了抢购日用品的风潮。美国“时代”杂志和“新闻周刊”都报道说，巴黎的家庭主妇们回想起第二次世界大战期间物资缺少的情况就感到惶惶不安，她们成群地拥到市场上和杂货铺子里去，争着买肥皂、蜡烛、大米、罐头食品、食盐和食糖。
    不久以前，法国财政部长拉马第埃宣布：食盐荒和食糖荒都已经出现了，他把责任归之于家庭主妇们的抢购行动。
    法国总理摩勒也在嘟哝地埋怨法国普通人，说他们不够镇静和缺少纪律，以致引起了“一个恐惧的新的浪潮”。但是，这究竟是谁的过错呢？法国普通人心里有数，摩勒总理当然也不会不知道。
