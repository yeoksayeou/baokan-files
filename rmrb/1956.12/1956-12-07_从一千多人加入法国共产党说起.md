    Starting from More Than a Thousand People Joining the French Communist Party
    Ma Tieding
    According to a TASS report from Paris on November 28: In the month of November, more than a thousand people across the country joined the French Communist Party.
    In a major country with revolutionary traditions like France, it would be a common occurrence for more than a thousand people to join the Communist Party in a single month during a high tide of revolution. However, at a time when a counter-revolutionary riot had just occurred in Hungary, and anti-Soviet and anti-communist sentiment in the Western capitalist world had suddenly intensified, and the communist movement was encountering obstacles in its advance, the fact that more than a thousand people joined the Party ranks could not but have special significance.
    In the face of every counter-revolutionary attack and frenzied offensive, there are always some people who, due to lack of experience or other reasons, temporarily lose their way and lose confidence; there are also always some wavering and unsteadfast elements who leave the revolutionary ranks. This has caused some people to have worries and anxieties that are unavoidable within human nature. However, facts have proven that the communist movement, the truly fighting party, can withstand tests. Moreover, after each test, the Party's ranks become purer; who is true gold and who is counterfeit becomes clearer; the counter-revolutionary attacks and offensives have played a role in awakening the revolutionaries, making their minds brighter, and making it easier to unite their own ranks more closely to meet new battles. On the one hand, a group of unsteadfast elements left the revolutionary ranks, and on the other hand, the revolutionary ranks gained new supplements in the battle. More than a thousand people joining the French Communist Party shows that even under the wind and rain stirred up by the counter-revolution, the French working class and working people still tend towards revolution and towards the Party. Their advanced elements are willing to advance under the banner of communism in the Party ranks!
    Having experienced a counter-revolutionary attack and offensive, people have become clearer about the hideous face of the counter-revolution. From the Hungarian incident, it can be seen that the counter-revolutionary elements employed by imperialism were nothing more than a group of robbers. At the same time, people have also become more aware of who is the mainstay of truly safeguarding the interests of the people? To break free from the chains of oppression and exploitation, to avoid having our true freedom taken away by those counter-revolutionary elements, there is only one way out: to consolidate and strengthen the revolutionary forces, and to resolutely fight against the reactionary forces. More than a thousand people joining the French Communist Party also shows that as long as the Party is rooted among the masses, the revolutionary forces will always be inexhaustible!
    The anti-Soviet and anti-communist counter-revolutionary currents in many regions are temporary phenomena. Although the communist movement will experience many twists and turns and difficulties in its journey, the general direction is determined, and the awakened people will eventually win the final victory. The dawn is ahead!

    从一千多人加入法国共产党说起
    马铁丁
    据塔斯社巴黎11月28日消息：在11月一个月内，全国各地有一千多人加入法国共产党。
    像法国这样富有革命传统的大国，在革命浪潮高涨的情况下，一月内有一千多人加入共产党，本是一件寻常的事情。但是，正当匈牙利发生了反革命暴乱，在西方资本主义世界里，反苏反共声浪忽又甚嚣尘上的今天，共产主义运动在其前进中间遭受阻碍的时候，一千多人加入党的行列，不能不有其特别的意义。
    在每一次反革命的袭击和猖狂进攻前面：总有一批人由于缺乏经验或其他原因，暂时的迷失了方向，丧失了信心；也总有一批动摇的、不坚定的分子离开了革命的队伍，这曾使一些人们产生了人情之内所难免的担心和忧虑。可是，事实证明，共产主义运动，真正战斗的党是经受得起考验的。而且经历一次考验，党的队伍更加纯洁了；谁是真金，谁是冒牌，也更加清楚了；反革命的袭击和进攻，对革命者起了惊醒的作用，头脑更加明亮了，更有利于把自己的队伍团结得更紧，以迎接新的战斗。一方面是一批不坚定的分子离开了革命的行列，另一方面革命的队伍又在战斗中获得了新的补充。一千多人加入法国共产党，它说明了：即使在反革命所掀起的狂风暴雨之下，法国工人阶级、劳动人民还是倾向着革命、倾向着党的。其先进部分是愿意在党的行列里高举着共产主义的大旗前进的！
    经历一次反革命的袭击和进攻，使人们更加看清了反革命的狰狞面目。从匈牙利事件中看出，那批为帝国主义所御用的反革命分子，原不过是一批打家劫舍的强盗。同时，也更加认识到究竟谁是真正维护人民利益的中流砥柱？要解脱被压迫被剥削的锁链，要免于被那批反革命分子夺去我们真正的自由，出路只有一条，那就是巩固和壮大革命的力量，坚定的同反动势力进行战斗。一千多人加入法国共产党，又说明了只要党根殖于群众中间，革命的力量总是用之不尽、取之不竭的！
    许多地区反苏反共的反革命逆流，那是暂时的现象，共产主义运动在其行程中尽管会经历着许多曲折和困难，总的方向是确定了的，觉悟了的人民，终会赢得最后胜利。曙光就在前头！
