　　Numerical Problems

　　This year, Shandong, Henan and other provinces have organized a large number of farmers to dig wells on the basis of cooperativization and have achieved great results. Before 1956, Shandong Province had a total of 1.5 million wells, which was the accumulation of labor over many years. However, only one year after cooperativization, the total number of wells surged to 2.66 million. As a result of Henan Province's mobilization to dig wells, the total number of wells has also increased by more than one million compared with last year. This was unimaginable in the era of individual agriculture.
　　However, some areas have also experienced many problems in well-digging because they put forward rigid numerical requirements for well-digging that were not in line with the actual situation and did not allow comrades and the masses below to modify them according to the actual situation. It is obviously a dry hillside, but the grassroots cadres insist that the masses dig wells here to complete the "task." As a result, they dug many feet deep, but there was no water at all, wasting their efforts. In low-lying areas, the masses are concerned about floods every year, but grassroots cadres also forced the masses to dig wells for the sake of "tasks" and reported them to their superiors. In some places, in order to use bricks for digging wells, the cadres even rudely demolished farmers' gate towers, eaves, walls and pig pens, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. Some places did not have the conditions for digging wells, but they insisted that the masses dig wells. As a result, the work was wasted, the money was spent, and finally the wells collapsed. According to Shandong Province's statistics, the defect rate is 30% (the 2.66 million wells mentioned earlier are good wells), and Henan also dug many defective wells.
　　Although the specific situations in other provinces and other work departments are different, they may all have had some similar experiences. Prescribing unrealistic rigid numerical requirements in the distribution of books and newspapers resulted in the phenomenon of forced distribution of books and newspapers. Prescribing unrealistic rigid numerical requirements in the development of savings resulted in the phenomenon of forced savings, and savers were not allowed to withdraw their deposits even when their family members fell ill. Some people with a fetish for numbers even demanded that numerical targets be set for letters of thanks from the masses to staff members (such as railway train personnel). As a result, staff members did not help those who really needed help, but instead helped those who did not need help but would write letters. Various absurd phenomena are often related to rigid numerical requirements.
　　Is it possible not to propose or to propose fewer rigid numerical requirements and other requirements? It should be said that at least the issue of "fewer" rigid numerical requirements can be considered. When superiors assign tasks to subordinates, they should talk more about policies and specific methods, introduce more good work experiences from various places, emphasize that all places should be realistic and proceed from reality to prescribe tasks, and propose fewer rigid numerical and other requirements from above. This should be considered correct.
　　Will reducing rigid numerical requirements cause self-flow and slackness in the work below, so that the various possibilities provided by the people's democratic system cannot be fully utilized and developed, and the progress of revolutionary work will be delayed? Of course, it is necessary to consider this, because this possibility does exist. However, it is wrong to think that this problem can be solved with rigid numerical requirements. Accurate numbers that have been carefully investigated and calculated and are both active and fully reliable can become the goals of the people's struggle and a powerful force for organizing and mobilizing the people. China's Five-Year Plan includes a large number of numbers, and they have all played a great role in organizing the masses. However, in our daily work, some of our numbers are not the result of careful investigation and calculation. They are often produced by rough estimates and have very little reliability; however, some leading organs use them as the basis for rigidly assigning numerical tasks to various regions and units, and do not allow them to appropriately expand or reduce them according to the specific situation. Facts have proved that this kind of subjective work method cannot give full play to the superiority of the new system, but can only waste this superiority and waste useful human and material resources. Just imagine, if the leading organs at all levels did not demand rigid well-digging numbers from lower levels, but instead consulted with lower levels at each level, helped lower levels conduct in-depth investigations and research, formulated well-digging plans in a realistic manner, and took the plans to the masses to consult with them and supplement and revise them according to the opinions of the masses, then why would we have dug so many defective wells in vain? Wouldn't it be much better if the many wasted useful human and material resources were used for agricultural and sideline production and other useful things than it is now?
　　Reducing rigid numerical requirements is not fundamentally opposed to numerical requirements, but is opposed to those numerical requirements that lack factual basis, opposed to subjective dogmatism, and opposed to treating unreliable numbers as reliable numbers and not allowing people to make necessary revisions based on the actual situation. If time is tight and there is really no time to conduct careful investigation and calculation, I think it is better for the superiors to temporarily not set numerical requirements, but to let the comrades below work while setting their own requirements based on the actual situation and reporting them to the superiors for approval. As long as the significance of this work is made clear to the comrades and the masses below, everyone will generally set out correct plans based on the actual possibilities in a realistic manner. Some people may especially like to be lazy and set fewer requirements, but that can only be a very small individual phenomenon. We should trust our comrades and the masses!
　　Reducing rigid numerical requirements is not advocating relaxing leadership and letting work flow freely; but advocating fundamentally improving leadership and adopting correct leadership methods. Numerical requirements are not like gambling and guessing, which can be shouted at will. This is to be responsible to the lower levels and the people. Numbers are the result of arduous and meticulous investigation, research and calculation, and only good subjective wishes and strong "will" are completely useless. In order to formulate correct plans, implement correct leadership, and make work advance rapidly, the only way is for leading organs and leaders to generally go deep into reality, familiarize themselves with reality, and proceed from reality in everything; at the same time, they must go deep into the masses and rely on the masses. This is not only necessary when implementing the plan, but also when formulating the plan. And even if this has already been done, it cannot be assumed that the numbers you have set are absolutely unchangeable. This is because: on the one hand, the objective situation is very complex, and the plan cannot cover all specific situations; on the other hand, what is suitable today may have some new conditions tomorrow and will not be completely suitable. If the plan is not appropriately revised according to the changed situation, there is a possibility of adverse consequences.

　　数字问题
　　林韦
    山东、河南等省今年在合作化的基础上，组织广大农民普遍打井，都取得了很大的成绩。山东省在1956年以前，水井总数是一百五十万眼，这是多少年代以来的劳动积累。可是合作化以后仅仅一年，水井总数就激增至二百六十六万眼了。河南省发动打井的结果，水井总数也比去年增加了一百多万眼。在个体农业时代，这都是不可想像的事。
    但是，也有一些地区因为对打井提出不切合实际情况的硬性数字要求，不容许下面同志和群众根据实际情况加以修正，所以在打井中也出了不少毛病。明明是一个干枯的高山坡，基层干部硬要群众在这里打井，完成“任务”。结果是打了许多丈深，根本无水，白费劲。在低洼地，群众每年关心的是涝灾，而基层干部为了“任务”，也强迫群众打井，打了给上级报。有的地方为了打井用砖，干部们甚至蛮横地扒了农民的门楼、房檐、墙头和猪圈，引起群众不满。有的地方没有具备打井条件，硬要群众打井，结果工也费了，钱也花了，最后井也坍了。山东全省统计，废品率是30％（前面提到的二百六十六万眼是好井），河南也打了不少废井。
    其他省份和其他工作部门，具体情况虽然各不相同，但类似的经验可能都有过一些。发行书报中规定了不切实际的硬性数字要求，结果是发生强迫摊派书报的现象。开展储蓄中规定不切实际的硬性数字要求，结果是发生强迫储蓄，储蓄者家里病倒了人而不允许提取存款的现象。有数字癖的人，甚至要求群众感谢工作人员（譬如铁路列车人员）的来信也要订出数字指标，结果是工作人员不去帮助那些真正需要帮助的人，而去帮助那些不需要帮助，但却会写信的人。各种各样的荒谬现象，同硬性的数字要求有关系的很多。
    是不是可以不提或少提硬性的数字要求和其他要求呢？应当说，至少可以考虑“少提”硬性数字要求的问题。上面对下面布置任务时，多讲政策和具体作法，多介绍些各地好的工作经验，强调各地实事求是，从实际出发来规定任务，少从上面提出硬性数字和其他要求，这样作应当被认为是正确的。
    少提硬性的数字要求，是不是会使下面工作发生自流和松懈现象，以致人民民主制度所提供的各种可能性不能充分利用和发挥，延缓了革命工作的进展速度呢？当然，考虑到这一层是必要的，因为这种可能确实存在着。可是如果以为有了硬性的数字要求就能解决这一问题，那是不对的。经过精密调查和计算的既积极又充分可靠的正确数字，可以成为人民群众的奋斗目标，成为组织和动员人民群众的强大力量。我国的五年计划，就包括了大量的数字，它们都起了组织群众的伟大作用。但是在日常工作中，我们有些数字并不是经过精密调查和计算的。它们往往产生于粗略的估计，可靠性很小；而有些领导机关却正是以此为据，就硬性分配给各地区各单位以数字任务，而又不允许人家根据具体情况适当伸缩增减。这样一种主观主义的工作方法，事实证明并不能发挥新制度的优越性，而只能浪费这种优越性，浪费有用的人力物力。试想，如果各级领导机关不是层层向下要求硬性的打井数字，而是层层与下级商量，帮助下级进行深入的调查研究，实事求是地制定打井计划，并且把计划拿到群众中去与群众商量，根据群众的意见加以补充修正，那我们何至于白白打那么多的废井呢？那许多浪费掉的有用的人力物力如果用到农业副业生产和其他有用的事情上，那不是比现在要好得多吗？
    少提硬性的数字要求，不是根本反对数字要求，而是反对那种缺乏事实根据的数字要求，反对主观主义的武断，反对把不可靠的数字当成可靠的数字，不许人家根据实际情况加以必要的修正。如果时间仓促，实在来不及进行精密的调查和计算，我以为上面宁可暂时不订数字要求，而让下面同志一面工作，一面在工作中根据实际情况自订，报上面审批。只要把这项工作的意义给下面同志和群众说清楚了，大家一般都会实事求是地根据实际可能来订出正确计划的。有些人也许特别喜欢偷懒少订，但那只能是极少数的个别现象。我们应该相信同志，相信群众！
    少提硬性的数字要求，也不是主张放松领导，让工作自流；而是主张从根本上改善领导，采取正确的领导方法。数字要求，这并不像打赌猜拳，可以随意吆喝。这是要对下级对人民负责任的。数字是艰苦细致的调查研究和计算的结果，仅有善良的主观愿望和坚强的“意志”完全无补于事。为了订定正确的计划，实行正确的领导，使工作迅速前进，唯一的办法就是领导机关和领导人要普遍地深入实际，熟悉实际，一切从实际出发；同时要深入群众，依靠群众。这并不只是在实现计划的时候才需要如此，订定计划的时候同样需要如此。而且即使已经这样作了，也不可以认为自己订出的数字就是绝对不能作丝毫更改的。这是因为：一方面，客观情况非常复杂，计划不可能包罗尽一切具体情况；另一方面，今天是适合的，明天也许有某些新条件产生，又会不完全适合了。如果不根据已经变化了的情况适当地修订计划，就有产生恶果的可能。
