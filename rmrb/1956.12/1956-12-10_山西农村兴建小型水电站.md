　　Shanxi Rural Areas Build Small Hydropower Stations
    (Our Newspaper News) In order to promote the realization of the National Agricultural Development Program and provide conditions for agricultural technological transformation, the Shanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau and the Shanxi Provincial Electrical and Mechanical Company, based on the demands of the masses of farmers, are actively helping agricultural production cooperatives build small hydropower stations.
    Currently, the earthwork, canal excavation, machine pits, and machine rooms for the five small hydropower stations in Xifu Village in Wutai County, Shuishentang in Guangling County, Shentou in Shuo County, Chengguan in Yuanqu County, and Zhaocheng Town in Hongzhao County are all under full-scale construction. By mid-November, the Xifu Village Power Station in Wutai County had completed various projects and ancillary works such as overflow dams, flood control dams, intake gates, diversion canals, tailrace canal culverts, and factory buildings, and more than 300 electric lights have been installed. Some external lines and indoor electric lights of the Zhaocheng Town Hydropower Station in Hongzhao County have also begun to be erected and installed.
    After these five small hydropower stations are completed, the total power generation will be 274 kilowatts, which can irrigate 38,000 mu of farmland (highland) and also provide lighting for agricultural cooperatives, farmers, institutions, and schools. During the slack winter season, electricity will be used for agricultural and sideline production such as oil pressing, flour milling, and cotton ginning.
    The foundation laying and civil construction of small power stations in Dajiao Town in Jiang County, Guaier Town in Zuoquan County, and Chengguan in Kelan County have also begun, and some have completed stone masonry and canal excavation projects.

　  山西农村兴建小型水电站
    本报讯　山西省水利局和山西省交电公司为了促进全国农业发展纲要的实现，给农业技术改造提供条件，根据农民群众的要求，积极帮助农业生产合作社建设小型水力发电站。
    现在，五台县西富村、广灵县水神堂、朔县神头、垣曲县城关、洪赵县赵城镇等五个小型水力发电站的土方、开渠、机坑、机房等土木工程都在全面施工。五台县西富村发电站到11月中旬除已完成滚水坝、防洪坝、进水闸、引水渠、尾水渠涵洞、厂房各项工程及附属工程外，并已安装起三百余盏电灯。洪赵县赵城镇水电站部分外线和室内电灯也开始架设和安装。
    这五个小型水力发电站建成后，总共发电量为二百七十四瓩，可灌溉田（高）地三万八千亩，还可供给农业社、农户、机关、学校照明。冬季农闲时期，电力将投入榨油、磨面、轧花等农副业生产。
    绛县大交镇、左权拐儿镇、岢岚县城关各小型电站的奠基土木建筑也开始施工，有的已完成了砌石和开渠工程。
