Xinhua News Agency, December 16th, Cairo Dispatch: The Director of the Egyptian Information Department, Abdel Kader Hatem, announced on December 15th that the Egyptian government had lodged a protest with the United Nations on December 14th regarding the illegal entry and robbery of private residences by British troops in Port Said, and demanded a halt to this Nazi-style behavior that violates international law.
    Hatem said that Egypt also protested the theft of private cars by British troops. The protest stated that these cars had been transported away during the withdrawal of British troops from Port Said.
    Hatem said that Egypt also demanded the immediate release of some prominent Egyptians who had been taken hostage by British troops.
    Hatem said that the Egyptian authorities had not received any "information about alleged attacks on the United Nations forces in Port Said," because "the responsibility for maintaining law and order in that place still rests with the British."
    Meanwhile, the Anglo-French aggressor forces, under the pretext of attacks on Anglo-French troops and the United Nations Emergency Force, suddenly surrounded the Arab residential area of Port Said on December 15th, conducting house-to-house searches and arresting nearly one thousand Egyptians.
    Xinhua News Agency, December 16th, TASS Cairo Dispatch, December 15th: The Anglo-French headquarters still does not allow foreign and Egyptian journalists to conduct interviews in Port Said. On the 14th, a group of journalists accompanying the United Nations Emergency Force, with the permission of the commander of the United Nations Emergency Force, arrived at the Indian troop garrison south of Port Said.
    According to newspaper reports, the Anglo-French headquarters actually protested this action by the journalists, considering these journalists as people who had "illegally infiltrated" the Port Said area. The Anglo-French headquarters demanded that the United Nations Emergency Force not allow journalists to approach the border of the Anglo-French troops' garrison. These actions by the Anglo-French headquarters aroused indignation among foreign and Egyptian journalists.

    英军仍在塞得港绑架抢劫
    埃及向联合国提出抗议
    新华社16日讯　开罗消息：埃及情报司司长阿卜杜勒·卡德尔·哈特姆12月15日宣布，埃及政府已经在12月14日对在塞得港的英军非法闯入并且抢劫私人住宅一事向联合国提出抗议，并且要求制止这种违反国际法的纳粹式的行为。
    哈特姆说，埃及也抗议了英军偷窃私人汽车的行为。抗议书说，这些汽车已在英军自塞得港撤退期间运走了。
    哈特姆说，埃及也要求立即释放被英军抓去当作人质的一些埃及社会名流。
    哈特姆说，埃及当局没有得到关于“据说联合国部队在塞得港受到袭击的情报”，因为“在那个地方维护法律和秩序的责任仍然由英国人担负。”
    同时，英法侵略军借口英法军队和联合国紧急部队受到袭击，在12月15日突然把塞得港阿拉伯人居住区包围起来，进行挨户搜查，并且拘捕了近一千名埃及人。
    新华社16日讯　塔斯社开罗15日讯：英法司令部仍然不允许外国和埃及记者到塞得港进行采访。14日，一批联合国紧急部队随军记者得到联合国紧急部队司令的许可，到达了塞得港南面的印度部队驻地。
    据报纸报道，英法司令部对记者这一行动居然提出了抗议，认为这些记者是“非法渗入”塞得港区的人。英法司令部要求联合国紧急部队不允许记者接近英法军队驻地边界。英法司令部这些行为引起了外国和埃及记者的愤慨。
