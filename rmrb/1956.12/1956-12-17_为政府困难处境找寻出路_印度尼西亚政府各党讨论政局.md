Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 15th: Newspaper reports indicate that representatives from the political parties participating in the Indonesian government are scheduled to meet today. According to "Indonesia News," the meeting aims to find a way out of the difficult situation facing the government.

According to reports, foreign policy issues, army matters, and the Lubis affair will be the main focus of discussion at the meeting of party representatives.

Recently, various political parties in Indonesia have frequently discussed the status of the current cabinet. Some members of the Masyumi Party have fiercely attacked the current cabinet, arguing that it should be replaced or reorganized. The more prevalent view among the parties in the current cabinet is that creating a cabinet crisis at this time is inappropriate.

"Indonesia News" reports that President Sukarno has drafted a plan to resolve the current difficulties, and he will convene leaders from various political parties and social figures to discuss it together.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta: Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo presented a report to the plenary session of the parliament on the evening of December 12th, regarding the course of the coup plot launched by former Army Deputy Chief of Staff Lubis.

Sastroamidjojo's report confirmed that Lubis planned to use force to kidnap the Army Chief of Staff and government ministers, dissolve the cabinet, arrest leaders of some political parties, and dissolve the parliament. Lubis also planned to carry out terrorist activities in the capital, Jakarta, and hold the President hostage to accept the proposals he put forward.

Sastroamidjojo said that fourteen military officers related to the Lubis affair have been placed under house arrest or dismissed from their posts.

He also said that the government's firm measures against the rebellious officers were for the sake of national security and the integrity of the armed forces, especially the army.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta: Lubis published his second open letter in the newspapers on the 14th after his escape.

In the letter, Lubis put forward his conditions for surrendering, demanding the establishment of a "caretaker cabinet" led by Hatta and Boruno, who recently resigned from the position of Vice President, and the replacement of the army leadership. (Boruno is the Sultan of Yogyakarta, who served as Minister of Defense in 1952)

In the letter, Lubis criticized the President, the Prime Minister, and the Army Chief of Staff.

    为政府困难处境找寻出路
    印度尼西亚政府各党讨论政局
    据新华社雅加达15日电　报纸消息说，印度尼西亚参加政府的各政党的代表，定于今天举行会议。据“印度尼西亚新闻”说，这次会议是为政府面临的困难处境寻找出路。
    据报纸说，外交问题、陆军问题和卢比斯事件将成为这次各政党代表会议的讨论中心。
    近来印度尼西亚各党派经常在讨论现内阁的地位问题。马斯友美党的一部分人士猛烈攻击现内阁，认为应该撤换或改组现内阁。现内阁各党派中较为普遍的意见是认为在目前制造内阁危机是不合时宜的。
    “印度尼西亚新闻”说，苏加诺总统已经拟定了一个解决当前困难问题的方案，他将召集各党派领袖和社会人士来共同讨论。
    据新华社雅加达电　印度尼西亚总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约12月12日晚上在国会的全体会议上，就前陆军副参谋长卢比斯发动政变阴谋的经过提出报告。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约的报告证实了卢比斯图谋用武力绑架陆军参谋长和政府部长，解散内阁，逮捕一些党派的领导人物，并且解散国会。卢比斯还准备在首都雅加达进行恐怖活动，挟持总统接受他们所提出的方案。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约说，同卢比斯事件有关的十四名军官已被软禁或免职。
    他还说，政府对反叛军官采取坚决的措施，是为了国家的安全和武装部队特别是陆军的完整。
    据新华社雅加达电　卢比斯14日在报纸上发表了他潜逃之后的第二封公开信。
    卢比斯在信里提出了他出来自首的条件，他要求成立一个由最近辞去副总统职位的哈达和波乌诺领导的“事务内阁”，并且调换陆军的领导人。（波乌诺是日惹苏丹，曾经在1952年担任过国防部长）
    卢比斯在信里指责了总统、总理和陆军参谋长。
