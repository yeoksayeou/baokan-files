　　Mobilize the Masses to Plant and Protect Forests

　　Jiangxi Convenes Meeting of Afforestation Activists

　　Nanchang, December 12 (Xinhua News Agency) - Deng Hong, Vice Governor of Jiangxi Province, said at the opening of the Jiangxi Provincial Afforestation Activists Conference on the 5th that in this winter's and next spring's afforestation work, it is necessary to prevent the subjective approach of blindly assigning afforestation tasks without considering the characteristics of different regions. Deng Hong said that last spring, some areas blindly assigned tasks, assigning tasks of raising fir seedlings and planting fir trees to hilly areas unsuitable for planting fir trees, while failing to properly arrange for oil tea, fruit trees, and bamboo suitable for planting in hilly areas. In some places, compulsory orders were also issued in order to complete afforestation tasks, and in some places, deforestation and land reclamation occurred, damaging soil and water conservation. He said that in afforestation this winter, these shortcomings should be overcome, and the masses must be relied upon and mobilized to complete the afforestation tasks for this winter and next spring. Areas where plans are not realistic should also be revised in a realistic manner.
　　Jiangxi Province is one of the major forest areas in southern China, and has supplied 5.26 million cubic meters of construction timber to all parts of the country in the past six years. Last winter, the province formulated a ten-year plan to green Jiangxi, and the people of the province actively participated in this work, completing an afforestation area of more than 3.28 million mu last winter and this spring. The Jiangxi Provincial Afforestation Activists Conference held on the 5th was to exchange afforestation experiences and further mobilize the masses of the people in the province to carry out a mass movement to green Jiangxi.

　　Forest Fires in Sichuan Greatly Reduced Compared to Last Year

　　Chengdu, December 12 (Xinhua News Agency) - Sichuan Province, which has 10 million hectares of forest area, has significantly reduced forest fires this year compared to last year. The area of forest area burned by fires and the loss of trees in the province this year decreased by more than 60% compared to last year. Among the 1,774 forest area townships that experienced mountain forest fires last year, 764 townships did not experience a single mountain forest fire from January to the end of November this year. Wulong County, which has a current forest area of more than 518,000 mu, experienced 185 mountain forest fires last year, and the number of fires that occurred from January to the end of November this year decreased to 41.

　　The person in charge of the Sichuan Provincial Forestry Department believes that the main reason for the significant reduction in forest fires in the province this year is that various localities have educated farmers in forest areas to change the old habit of burning mountains to accumulate fertilizer, and organized the masses to carry out forest protection and fire prevention work. Now, many townships and villages in forest areas have established fire prevention teams and forest protection groups, and have implemented fire prevention systems such as contracted responsibility by area, joint prevention, and patrol, which has played a significant role in forest protection and fire prevention.

    江西召开造林积极分子大会
    江西省副省长邓洪在5日开幕的江西省造林积极分子大会上说：在今冬明春造林工作中要防止不根据不同地区的特点，盲目分配造林任务的主观主义做法。邓洪说，今年春天有的地区盲目分配任务，把杉树育苗和植杉任务分配给不适宜植杉的丘陵地区，对丘陵地区适宜种植的油茶、果树、竹子却没有很好安排。有的地方为了完成造林任务也发生过强迫命令的做法，有些地方也发生毁林垦荒破坏水土保持的现象。他说：在今冬造林时，应该克服这些缺点，必须依靠和发动群众，完成今冬明春的造林任务。有的地区计划不切合实际的，也应该实事求是地加以修正。
    江西省是我国南方的主要林区之一，六年来供应全国各地的建设用材达五百二十六万立方公尺。去年冬天，该省制定了十年绿化江西的规划，全省人民积极地参加了这一工作，去冬今春完成的造林面积达三百二十八万多亩。5日举行的江西省造林积极分子大会，就是为了交流造林经验，进一步动员全省人民群众，开展群众性的绿化江西运动。　（新华社）
    四川森林火灾比去年大大减少
    拥有一千万公顷森林面积的四川省，今年森林火灾比去年显著减少。全省今年因火灾延烧林区的面积和林木损失，比去年减少60％以上。去年发生山林火灾的一千七百七十四个林区乡中，有七百六十四个乡自今年1月到11月底没有发生过一次山林火灾。现有森林面积五十一万八千多亩的武隆县，去年发生山林火灾一百八十五次，今年1月到11月底发生的火灾减少到四十一次。
    四川省林业厅的负责人认为，今年各地教育林区农民改变放火烧山积肥的旧习惯，组织群众开展护林防火工作，是今年全省森林火灾大大减少的主要原因。现在许多林区的乡、村都成立了防火队和护林小组，并且实行划片包干、联防、巡回等防火制度，这对护林防火起了很大作用。　（新华社）
