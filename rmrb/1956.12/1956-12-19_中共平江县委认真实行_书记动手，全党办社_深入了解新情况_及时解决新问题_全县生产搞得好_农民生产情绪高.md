Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 18th: (Xinhua News Agency reporter Cheng Kun reports): The CPC Pingjiang County Committee has implemented "Secretary Takes Action, the Whole Party Runs the Cooperatives." Over the past year, it has solved a series of new and important problems in leading agricultural cooperative production, achieving great results. These achievements are: overcoming the rare drought of the century and various difficulties, increasing grain production by 27% compared to 1955, the highest historical annual output, and other income is also more than in previous years; the average net income of the county's 540,000 farmers increased by 25% per household compared to last year; ensuring that 92.6% of the cooperatives increased production and 91% of the cooperative members increased income (households with guaranteed production accounted for 7%).

Pingjiang County has many mountains and little land (only more than 600,000 mu of farmland), and the area is vast (300 li from east to west). After the merging of districts and townships this spring, the work encountered great difficulties. At that time, apart from the general branch secretary who was the original district-level cadre, the rest of the cadres in the township were newly promoted from the countryside. Everyone was unable to grasp the new problems that occurred continuously in agricultural production after cooperativization, and they called the county party committee for solutions every day. The county party committee office had nine people specifically answering phones every day, but it was not enough for the 52 townships to report the situation once in three days; calling everyone to a meeting, including the county party committee members and township general branch secretaries, totaled more than 70 people. The mountains were far and the roads were long, and time did not allow it. The county party secretary and several key cadres were entangled in meetings at the higher level and in the county, and rarely had an in-depth understanding and research of the rural situation. The vast majority of county party committee members were trained locally after liberation and had little work experience. Seeing that the secretary could not come up with a solution, they were also at a loss. The township branches generally complained that the county party committee's leadership was not timely or specific enough. This situation lasted for about a month. The county party committee decided to change this bureaucratic leadership method. The nine standing committee members of the county party committee, including one secretary and two deputy secretaries, took turns taking care of the work in the county, and they went to the cooperatives to conduct specific leadership. The secretary took charge of the major problems currently occurring, researched and resolved them. At the same time, the county divided the county's 52 townships into 13 regions and sent nearly 400 cadres from the county, led by county party committee members and responsible county-level cadres to be responsible for the regions. In addition, the county party committee established two investigation teams to regularly help the leadership go deep into agricultural cooperatives to investigate and study some important issues. In this way, communication was achieved between the top and bottom, and the county party secretary felt that he had become a "living" secretary and had ways to lead; the county party committee members also had confidence in leading agricultural cooperative production; the township branches also reflected: as long as the county party committee leads us in this way, we are not afraid of any more complicated work.

The biggest advantage of implementing "Secretary Takes Action, the Whole Party Runs the Cooperatives" is that it can promptly solve some extremely complex problems that constantly occur in agricultural cooperative production. For example, after rice transplanting this year, the rural areas of Pingjiang County generally felt a shortage of funds. Even the fertilizers of the supply and marketing cooperatives and the revolving grain of the grain bureau could not be sold. About 8,000 cooperative member households in the county had great difficulties in life; in particular, agricultural cooperatives were unable to raise more than 1 million yuan in funds. At this time, the townships reflected that the middle peasants had money, and the main solution proposed for the funding problem was to persuade and educate the middle peasants to take out money. Some responsible cadres of the county party committee went to the cooperatives and also felt that it was necessary to do so. Therefore, they mobilized middle peasants to invest in the Donggao Agricultural Cooperative, and the townships followed suit. Some townships even forced the middle peasants to take out money. Seeing this situation, the middle peasants generally felt panicked. After studying these situations, the county party committee promptly stopped this phenomenon. However, the problem was still not solved. A quarter of the county's 160,000 full laborers were idle; more than 40,000 women and semi-laborers could not find work. After the county party secretary went down to investigate, he saw that not only had the new production avenues that should have been opened up in the cooperatives this year not been opened up, but the sideline production that had been carried out every year had been stopped. This was the result of only focusing on grain production without simultaneously developing diversified operations. The county party committee immediately dispatched three investigation teams to investigate in three different regions to understand the proportion of local sideline income to total income last year: mountainous areas accounted for more than 40%, hilly areas accounted for more than 35%, and plain areas accounted for about 30%. Based on on-the-spot investigations, the county party committee decided to mobilize all cooperatives to "vigorously develop diversified operations on the premise of ensuring increased grain production." About half a month later, the rural areas became active. In the second half of June, the county's sideline income alone was 1.86 million yuan, allowing many households in difficulty to survive the summer famine.

However, because the county party committee did not clearly explain the boundaries between cooperative and household production when deploying the above work, more than 500 cooperatives quickly unified all sideline occupations and cooperative members' livestock and poultry in the cooperatives. Complaints arose throughout the countryside. The concentration of live pigs alone resulted in the loss of more than 1,000 heads, and countless chickens and ducks. Women and semi-laborers still had nothing to do, wasting a lot of funds. At this time, many cadres and cooperative cadres also criticized cooperative members for not obeying leadership and not understanding the superiority of agricultural cooperatives. After the county party secretary and the director of the county party committee's rural work department went to the cooperatives to analyze and study the situation, they realized that this was the result of not clearly defining the boundaries between cooperative and household production. Although the higher authorities had not yet given clear instructions on this issue at the time, based on actual needs, the county party committee notified the entire county, requiring that everything suitable for cooperative members' household management be assigned to cooperative members' management; anything that requires large investment, a lot of labor, and cooperative members do not have the strength to manage, should be assigned to the cooperative's management. At the same time, it was pointed out that leadership should be strengthened and not be allowed to drift. Since then, various rural production activities have developed rapidly, and women and semi-laborers also have things to do.

Another advantage of implementing "Secretary Takes Action, the Whole Party Runs the Cooperatives" is that it can promptly and quickly discover and deal with some major problems that can affect the overall situation if one is not careful. For example, this year's early rice harvest was achieved under the severe threat of summer drought. At that time, many people became complacent, thinking that there would be no problems with the autumn harvest and future production activities. In particular, young cooperative members wanted to take advantage of the time when they had money to engage in some cultural and welfare construction. When the Xinmin Agricultural Cooperative was just starting to build a club, because the county party committee grasped the ideological dynamics of the various agricultural cooperatives, and saw the seriousness of this matter, it immediately notified the entire county. This alerted cadres and the masses. This played a decisive role in ensuring that 92.6% of the cooperatives increased production and 91% of the cooperative members increased income this year. Not long ago, as soon as the county's income distribution was finalized, many cooperative members became uneasy, and many people requested to withdraw from the cooperative. Based on the situation reported by the secretaries and county party committee members who went to the cooperatives, the county party committee analyzed and studied and found that the main reason was that the agricultural cooperatives adopted the method of average deduction of share funds, without taking into account the actual living difficulties of cooperative members; another reason was that the cooperatives did not arrange the production work for households with reduced production and a few households in difficulty. Based on these situations, the county party committee promptly took measures to solve these problems, and the voices of unrest in the countryside disappeared. Currently, farmers across the county are actively engaged in winter production work.

    中共平江县委认真实行“书记动手，全党办社”
    深入了解新情况　及时解决新问题
    全县生产搞得好　农民生产情绪高
    新华社长沙18日电　新华社记者程坤报道：中共平江县委员会实行“书记动手，全党办社”，一年来在领导农业社生产中解决了一系列的新的重要问题，获得很大的成绩。这些成绩是：战胜了百年来少见的大旱灾和各种困难，使粮食产量比历史上最高年产量的1955年增产27％，其他收入也比往年多，全县五十四万农民的纯收入平均每户比去年增加25％；保证了92.6％的社增产和91％的社员增加收入（保产户占7％）。
    平江县山多田少（仅有六十多万亩田），地区辽阔（从东到西有三百里），今年春天撤区并乡以后，工作上曾遇到很大的困难。当时乡里的干部除总支书记是原来的区级干部外，其余都是新从农村中提拔起来的，大家对合作化以后在农业生产上接连发生的新问题抓不起来，天天打电话向县委要办法。县委办公室每天有九个专门接电话的人，但是，要五十二个乡汇报一次情况，三天还不够；找大家来开会，连县委委员和乡总支书记在内共有七十多人，山遥路远，时间也不允许。县委书记和几个主要干部成天纠缠在上级和本县的会议里，很少对农村情况作深入的了解和研究。绝大多数县委委员都是解放后在本地培养起来的，工作经验较少，看见书记拿不出办法来，也就束手无策。乡支部普遍埋怨县委领导不及时，不具体。这种情况大约经过一个月，县委决定改变这种官僚主义的领导方法，县委九个常委，包括一个书记、两个副书记，除经常有一、二人轮流在县里照管工作外，都下到社里进行具体领导；对当前发生的重大问题由书记掌握，研究解决，同时还把全县五十二个乡划分成十三个片，从县上派出近四百名干部，由县委委员和县级负责干部率领分片负责包干。此外，县委还成立两个调查组，经常帮助领导上深入农业社调查研究一些重要问题。这样一来，做到了上下通气，县委书记感到自己成了“活”书记，领导有办法了；县委委员也都对领导农业社生产有了信心；乡支部也反映：只要县委这样领导我们干，再复杂的工作也不怕。
    实行“书记动手，全党办社”的最大好处，就是能够及时解决农业社生产中不断发生的一些极其复杂的问题。例如，今年插秧后，平江县农村普遍感到资金短少，甚至供销社的肥料和粮食局的周转粮都卖不出去，全县约有八千户社员生活很困难；特别是农业社一百多万元资金无法筹集。这时各乡反映中农有钱，提出解决资金的办法主要是说服教育中农拿出钱来。县委有的负责干部下到社去，也认为不这样做不行，于是就在东高农业社发动中农投资，各乡跟着试行，有些乡甚至还有硬要中农拿钱的事情发生，中农看到这种情况普遍感到恐慌。县委研究了这些情况后，及时制止了这种现象。但是问题还是没有解决，全县十六万个全劳动力就有四分之一闲着；四万多个妇女和半劳动力找不到工作。县委书记下去调查以后，看出不仅今年社里应该开辟的新的生产门路没有开辟，反而把年年都进行的副业生产全都停了，这是只顾粮食生产而没有同时开展多种经营的结果。县委立即派出三个调查组，到不同的三种地区进行调查，了解去年当地副业收入占全部收入的比重：山区占40％以上，丘陵地区占35％以上，平原地区约占30％。根据实地调查，县委就决定发动各社“在保证粮食增产的前提下，大力开展多种经营”。约莫半个月以后，农村就活跃起来了。在6月后半月，全县光副业收入就有一百八十六万元，使很多困难户渡过了夏荒。
    但是，由于县委在布置以上工作的时候，没有把社、家生产的界限交代清楚，很快就有五百多个社把一切副业以及社员的家畜、家禽都统一在社里，农村怨声四起，集中起来的光生猪一项就损失一千多头，鸡鸭不计其数；妇女和半劳动力还是没事干，浪费了很多资金。这时，许多干部和社干部还批评社员不服从领导，不懂得农业社的优越性。经过县委书记和县委农村工作部长下社分析研究了这一情况以后，才发现这是没有把社、家生产界限划分清楚的结果。虽然当时上级对这个问题还没有明确指示，但根据实际需要，县委就通报全县，要求把一切适合社员家庭经营的都划归社员经营；凡投资大、花工多、社员没有力量经营的，就划归社里经营。同时指出要加强领导，不能放任自流。此后，农村各项生产一直发展很快，妇女和半劳力也都有事作了。
    实行“书记动手，全党办社”的另一个好处，是能够及时而迅速地发现和处理一些一不小心就会影响全局的重大问题。例如，今年早稻丰收是在夏旱严重威胁下争取得来的，当时很多人就自满起来，认为秋收和今后各项生产都没有问题，特别是青年社员都想趁有钱时候搞一些文化福利建设。新民农业社在刚起盖俱乐部时，由于县委掌握了各农业社的思想动态，看出这件事情的严重意义，立即通报全县。这样使干部和群众都警惕起来。这对保证今年92.6％的社增产和91％的社员增加收入起了决定性的作用。不久前，全县收益分配刚定案，就有许多社员心情不安，不少人要求退社。县委根据下社的书记和县委委员汇报的情况，分析研究后发现主要是各农业社扣除股份基金采取平均扣除的办法，不照顾社员实际生活困难引起来的；另一原因是社里没有把减产户和少数困难户的生产工作安排好。县委根据这些情况，及时采取了措施，解决了这些问题，农村中不安的呼声便没有了。目前，全县农民都在积极地从事冬季生产工作。
