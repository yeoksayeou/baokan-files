　　Friends, Come!
　　Dear young comrades:
　　I am a soldier of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who joined the army last year. I would like to report to you on my life in the army for the past year or so.
　　I come from a poor peasant family. When I first arrived in the army, I was very unaccustomed to the life, and I had many difficulties. I thought to myself: life in the army is so tense every day, the system is so strict, and I haven't even gone to school, I can't even understand a family letter. When the instructor gives cultural lessons, I get so anxious that my eyes are dizzy and I can't learn. What should I do? At this time, the old comrades often said to me: "Coming to the army from your hometown, there will always be difficulties in life, don't worry, we will help you."
　　Last June, I caught a cold. The company commander and instructor took care of me like a mother, comforted me, made rice and soup for me, and told me battle stories. At that time, I was so moved that I shed many tears, thinking: "Only in the revolutionary army can I enjoy such warmth!"
　　Military training and cultural studies began, and the superiors called on us new comrades to answer the people of the motherland with excellent results. At that time, I thought to myself: my cultural level is so low, how can I improve? How can I learn the skills of modern warfare? Although I expressed my determination to the squad leader to strive for excellent results, when I went to the training ground to do gun practice, I couldn't even do dressing, about-face. The squad leader taught me the actions of holding a gun and carrying a gun many times, but I still couldn't do it. I felt very ashamed. The squad leader saw that I was very anxious, so he individually taught me on the side of the training ground and said, "It doesn't matter, learn slowly, you will definitely be able to do it." During the break, the old comrades taught me and said, "We used to be just like you! Don't worry!" Under such patient guidance, coupled with my hard study and practice, I finally achieved excellent results and completed the military training tasks. In cultural studies, because the instructor explained each word to me and taught me how to write, now I have improved to the level of higher elementary school and can write letters.
　　This year, my combat skills and cultural level have improved, and I have been commended for this. In May, the Youth League admitted me as a glorious member of the Youth League, and administratively, I was appointed as a squad leader. I feel a great responsibility. In the future, I will work and study more actively to answer the care and expectations of the superiors and the people for me.
　　Friends, come! Let us stand shoulder to shoulder and defend our great motherland!

### 朋友们来吧

　　朋友们来吧亲爱的青年同志们：
    我是去年入伍的中国人民解放军战士，我把我一年多来在部队的生活情况向你们汇报一下。
    我是一个贫农家庭出身的孩子。刚到部队时生活非常不习惯，困难也很多。心想：军队生活每天这样紧张，制度又这样严，自己又没念过书，连一封家信也看不下来，教员给上文化课时，急得眼花头昏学不进去，可怎么办呢？这时老同志常对我说：“离开故乡刚到部队里来，生活上总是会有困难的，不要着急，咱们帮助你。”
    去年6月间，我患了感冒，连长、指导员像母亲一样地照看我，安慰我；并给我作饭、作汤，讲战斗故事，当时我被感动得流了许多眼泪，心想：“只有在革命部队，才能享受到这样的温暖啊！”
    军事训练和文化学习开始了，上级号召我们新同志要用优秀的成绩来回答祖国人民。当时我心里想：文化程度这样低，怎么能提高呢？怎么能学好现代作战的本领呢？我虽然向班长表示了争取作出优秀成绩的决心，可是一到操场上做枪法动作时，我连看齐、向后转都不会；拿枪、背枪等动作，班长教我好几遍还不会。自己感到很惭愧。班长看出我很急，就个别在操场一旁教我，并说：“不要紧，慢慢学，一定能会。”休息时，老同志一边教我一边对我说：“过去咱们也跟你一样呀！别着急！”我就在这样耐心教导下，再加上自己苦学苦练，终于取得了优秀成绩，完成了军事训练任务。在文化学习上，由于教员一个字一个字地给我讲，并拿着我的手教我写字，现在已经提高到高小文化程度，会写信了。
    今年，我的战斗本领和文化水平提高了，并因此受到了表扬。5月间，青年团吸收我作为光荣的青年团员，行政上又让我担任班长，我感到责任很大。今后我要更加积极地工作和学习，来回答上级和人民对我的关怀和期望。
    朋友们，来吧，让咱们在一起，肩并肩地保卫咱们伟大的祖国吧！　中国人民解放军中士班长
