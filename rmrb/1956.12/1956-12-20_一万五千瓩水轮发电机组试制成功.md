Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 19th. The workers of Harbin Electric Machinery Factory, who previously manufactured 10,000 kW and 12,000 kW hydroelectric equipment for the Guanting Hydropower Station and the Shizitan Hydropower Station, successfully trial-produced a 15,000 kW hydroelectric generator set on the evening of the 17th.

This is the first of several power generation equipments manufactured for Shangyou Hydropower Station in Jiangxi Province. This unit has undergone sub-assembly testing, and the quality meets the requirements.

The 15,000 kW hydroelectric generator set was designed by Chinese designers using the latest Soviet data, based on the specific conditions of Chinese hydropower stations. The generator's circular base is so large that it is difficult for thirteen people to encircle it hand-in-hand, and the water turbine's inlet diameter is as tall as two people. The electricity generated by this unit is enough to illuminate a city of one million people.

The workers of Harbin Electric Machinery Factory, who already have experience in manufacturing approximately 10,000 kW hydroelectric equipment, successfully completed the trial production of the first 15,000 kW power generation equipment. The workers are now manufacturing the second unit, which is expected to be completed before the end of the year.

    一万五千瓩水轮发电机组试制成功
    新华社哈尔滨19日电　曾经为官厅水电站、狮子滩水电站制造一万瓩和一万二千瓩水力发电设备的哈尔滨电机厂职工，十七日晚又试制成功了一万五千瓩水轮发电机组。
    这是为江西上犹水电站制造的几台发电设备中的第一台。这台机组进行了分装配试验，质量合乎要求。
    一万五千瓩的水轮发电机组是我国设计人员采用苏联的最新资料，根据我国水电站的具体情况设计的。它的发电机圆形机座之大，十三个人手拉手都很难围过来，水轮机的进水口直径有两个人高。这台机组发出的电力够一百万人口的城市照明用。
    已经具有制造一万瓩左右水力发电设备经验的哈尔滨电机厂职工，比较顺利地完成了第一台一万五千瓩发电设备的试制工作。现在职工们正在进行第二台机组的制造，预计在年底以前可以完成。
