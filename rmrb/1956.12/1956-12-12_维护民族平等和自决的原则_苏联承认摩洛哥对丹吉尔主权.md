    Upholding the Principles of National Equality and Self-determination
    The Soviet Union Recognizes Moroccan Sovereignty over Tangier
    Xinhua News Agency, 11th: TASS, Moscow: The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on December 10th stating:
    The Soviet government issued a statement on October 9th this year regarding the abolition of the international administration of the Tangier region, expressing its welcome for the Moroccan government's initiative to reintegrate Tangier into Morocco.
    As a signatory government of the 1906 Algeciras Treaty and a participant in the 1945 Paris Conference, the Soviet government, in line with the great principles of national equality and self-determination, and respecting the legitimate aspirations of the Moroccan people for national independence and unity, hereby declares that the Soviet Union fully recognizes Moroccan sovereignty over Tangier and believes that the relevant international agreements on Tangier have become invalid.
    The Soviet government is convinced that the abolition of the international administration of Tangier and the restoration of Moroccan sovereignty over Tangier will help consolidate peace and friendship among peoples and will help develop international cooperation on the basis of the principles of equality and mutual respect for national sovereignty.
    The Soviet government wishes the Moroccan people the most brilliant victories in national rejuvenation and national prosperity.
    (Editor's note) Tangier is located at the western entrance of the Strait of Gibraltar, with important strategic value, and is part of Moroccan territory. After the signing of the treaty in Algeciras, Spain in 1906, Tangier was jointly administered by Britain, France, Italy, and Spain. After World War II, the Treaty of Paris stipulated that Tangier would be jointly administered by eight countries: France, Britain, the United States, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain, but in fact, France and Spain were in control. After Morocco gained independence, it firmly demanded the return of Tangier. In October this year, Morocco and the eight co-administering countries reached an agreement to hand over the administrative, legislative, and judicial institutions of Tangier to Morocco, but to maintain the economic and financial systems of the co-administration period.

    维护民族平等和自决的原则
    苏联承认摩洛哥对丹吉尔主权
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部12月10日发表声明说：
    苏联政府曾在今年10月9日就废除丹吉尔地区的国际共管问题发表声明，表示欢迎摩洛哥政府旨在使丹吉尔重新合并于摩洛哥的倡议。
    作为1906年阿尔几西拉斯条约的缔约国政府和1945年巴黎会议的参加者，苏联政府本着民族平等和自决的伟大原则、尊重摩洛哥人民争取国家独立和统一的正当的愿望，特此声明，苏联完全承认摩洛哥对丹吉尔的主权，同时认为，与它有关的关于丹吉尔的国际协定已经失去效力。
    苏联政府深信，废除丹吉尔的国际共管和恢复摩洛哥对丹吉尔的主权将有助于巩固和平和各国人民的友好，将有助于在平等和互相尊重国家主权的原则基础上发展国际合作。
    苏联政府祝摩洛哥人民在民族复兴和国家繁荣方面取得最辉煌的胜利。
    （编者注）丹吉尔位于直布罗陀海峡西部的进口，具有重要的战略价值，是摩洛哥领土的一部分。1906年在西班牙阿尔几西拉斯签订条约后，丹吉尔曾先后被英、法、意和西班牙所共管。第二次世界大战后，巴黎条约又规定丹吉尔由法、英、美、意、比、荷、葡和西班牙八国共管，而实际上是法、西两国在掌握统治权。摩洛哥取得独立后，坚决要求归还丹吉尔。今年10月间，摩洛哥和八个共管国达成协议，决定把丹吉尔的行政、立法和司法机构交还给摩洛哥，但是要保持共管时期的经济和财政制度。
