Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: Augusta, Georgia dispatch: The White House announced on the 6th that the United States government "will use air and sea transport" and will "at maximum speed" transport Hungarian "refugees" to the United States. It said: "Most of the airlift will be carried out by the United States Air Force and United States Navy aircraft through the Military Air Transport Service. Sea transport will be carried out by United States Navy transport ships through the Military Sea Transport Service."

The White House statement, referring to the American plan to kidnap refugees, said: "The work of transporting the originally planned five thousand refugees has already been arranged by the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration. This work will continue as planned. The President has also requested the Committee to arrange similar transport, additionally transporting 1,500 refugees from Austria to the United States under the Refugee Relief Act. The entire responsibility for transporting the remaining 15,000 refugees from Europe to the United States will be borne by the Department of Defense."

It also said that the United States will use three naval transport ships for sea transport. Air transport will also begin in the next few days, transporting 200 people per day, gradually increasing to 500 people per day. "In this way, it may be possible to transport most of those refugees who want to come by plane out of Austria by the end of the year or a little later."

The statement indicated that Eisenhower will also ask Congress to pass a bill allowing Hungarian "refugees" to reside permanently in the United States.

    干涉匈牙利内政的凶相毕露
　　美国决定用海空军劫运匈难民
    据新华社7日讯　佐治亚州奥古斯大消息：白宫6日宣布，美国政府“将利用空运和海运”并且将“以最大的速度”把匈牙利的“难民”运到美国来。它说：“大部分的空运将由美国空军和美国海军的飞机通过军事空运部进行。海运将由美国海军的运输舰通过军事海运部进行。”
    白宫的声明谈到美国劫运难民的计划说：“运送原定的五千难民的工作已经先由各国政府欧洲移民委员会安排好了。这个工作将按原定计划继续进行。总统还要求委员会安排类似的运送，另外从奥地利运送将根据难民救济法入境的一千五百名难民到美国来。把余下的一万五千个难民从欧洲运送到美国来的全部责任将由国防部负担。”
    它还说，美国将用三艘海军运输舰来从事海运。空运也将在今后几天中开始，每天运送二百人，以后逐渐增加到每天五百人。“这样，大约到年底或是比这再晚一些时候，就有可能把那些要乘飞机前来的难民大部分运出奥地利。”
    声明表示，艾森豪威尔还要要求国会通过一项法案，使匈牙利“难民”能在美国永久居住。
