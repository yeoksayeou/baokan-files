　　The Secret That Couldn't Be Kept
    On November 29th, the British acting Prime Minister Butler encountered a problem in the House of Commons.
    A member of parliament questioned him as to whether Britain participated in a secret organization called "Amilcar." This question startled Butler, so he immediately put on a blank face and pretended to be ignorant, saying, "Britain knows nothing about such an organization."
    However, as he spoke, Mr. Butler suddenly seemed to know a little about this organization. He mentioned that the "Times" magazine had published news about this organization and its name on November 12th, and he said, "This news is incorrect." So, what is the correct news? Obviously, Butler felt that if he continued to talk, he would reveal even more, so he changed his tune, avoided the topic, rambled on about ancient and modern times, and flaunted his historical knowledge, saying, "From 1942 to 1946, the word 'Amilcar' was used as a code. When I traced history, I found that this word was used once in 247 BC.” This statement was tantamount to showing that he had already put a great deal of research into this “unknown” name, which caused the members of parliament to burst into laughter.
    In fact, Butler's feigning ignorance and rambling are useless. Many people already know that before the British and French invaders attacked Egypt, they colluded with Israel. The British and French had long established a joint military organization to secretly launch the attack and stole the name of the father of the ancient Carthaginian general Hannibal - Amilcar as the code for this organization. Although Butler and his ilk are still keeping it secret today, the actions of the Anglo-French conspiracy organization represented by the tarnished name "Amilcar," which was established for the invasion of Egypt, have been exposed to the world.

　　守不住的秘密
    11月29日，英国代理首相巴特勒在下议院里碰到了一个难题。
    一个议员质问他，英国是否参加了一个名叫“阿米尔卡”的秘密组织。这个问题使巴特勒吃了一惊，于是他立即板起脸孔装傻地说：“英国不知道这样的一个组织。”
    但是，说着说着，巴特勒先生忽然又好像知道一点关于这个组织的事了。他提到11月12日“时代”杂志上刊登过关于这个组织和它的名字的消息，他说：“这个消息是不正确的。”那么，正确的消息是什么呢？显然，巴特勒感到如果再谈下去，一定会露出更多的马脚来，于是他就改变口锋，避开主题，上下古今地胡扯，并且卖弄他的历史知识说：“从1942年到1946年，‘阿米尔卡’这个字曾被当作一个电码使用过。我在追溯历史时，发现这个字在公元前二百四十七年使用过一次。这番话无异表明他对于这个“不知道”的名字早就下过一翻很大的研究功夫了，因而引起议员们的哄然大笑。
    其实，巴特勒的装傻和胡扯都是没有用的。许多人都已知道，英法侵略者在进攻埃及以前，同以色列进行了勾结，英法早就建立了密谋发动进攻的联合军事机构，并且盗用了古代迦太基大将汉尼拔的父亲的名字——阿米尔卡做这个组织的暗号。巴特勒之流尽管到今天还在严守秘密，但是，“阿米尔卡”这个被污损了的名字所代表的英法为侵略埃及而建立的阴谋组织的行动，已暴露在世人面前了。　（方）
