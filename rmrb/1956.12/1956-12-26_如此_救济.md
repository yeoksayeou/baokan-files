Such "Relief"
The leaders of the Jinan Law School in Shandong Province, upon hearing that the year-end surplus would be frozen and handed over, also contracted the "epidemic" of rushing to spend money when subsidizing students with family difficulties and issuing individual relief funds. At first, they gave to whoever applied, so that some people whose families were not in difficulty received relief funds; some had already made cotton clothes and also received cotton clothing subsidies; and some even applied for only six yuan in relief because their difficulties were not great, but the school insisted on giving them more than ten yuan. Originally, this kind of relief method had already gone beyond the scope of relief, but unexpectedly, the leaders of Jinan Law School, seeing that there was still a large surplus, felt that such piecemeal relief was neither "generous" nor too troublesome. Therefore, they decided to thoroughly provide relief, adopting a self-reporting and public discussion method to carry out a thorough and comprehensive large-scale relief effort. Having done this, it should have come to an end, but no, because after settling the accounts, there was more than two thousand yuan left, and they seemed uneasy if they didn't spend it all. So the school decided to have another "additional" round.

Relief was originally intended to help students solve their own or their family's difficulties, but the practice of the leaders of Jinan Law School is actually not relief, but squandering.

    如此“救济”
    山东省济南法律学校的领导上，听说年终结余要冻结上交，于是在补助学生家庭困难和发放个人救济款时，也害起突击花钱的“流行病”来。开始是谁申请就给谁，以致有的家庭并不困难的人领到了救济款；有的已经做好了棉衣、也得到了棉衣补助费；甚至有人因为困难不大只申请救济六元，而学校硬要救济十多元。本来，这种救济办法，已经越出了救济的范围，但想不到济南法律学校的领导上眼看着结余尚多，还嫌这样的零星救济既不“大方”、又太麻烦，于是决定彻底救济一下，采取自报公议的办法来一次彻底的全面的大救济。事情办到这里，总可告一结束了吧，不然，因为结算帐目之后，剩了两千多元，不用完似乎于心不安。于是校方又决定再来一次“追加”。
    救济，原本是为了帮助学生解决自己或家庭困难的，但是，像济南法律学校领导上这种作法实际上已不是救济，而是在那里挥霍了。
