    Actively Guide Young Students Forward
    Since the beginning of the autumn semester this year, under the guidance of the policy of comprehensive development, colleges and universities have further improved their teaching work, paid attention to improving teaching quality, and paid attention to overcoming the shortcomings of formalism and excessive collectivization in political and ideological work and extracurricular activities. With the implementation of these new measures, many new scenes have emerged. Students' enthusiasm and consciousness for learning have been further improved, paying attention to in-depth study, hard work, and expanding their knowledge fields. Students' thinking and democratic life have become more active, daring to express their opinions, and the atmosphere of independent thinking has risen. School life has gotten rid of the excessively tense state and is more pleasant and lively than before.
    However, in the process of improving teaching work, ideological education work has not kept up well. While proposing to develop individuality and take care of personal strengths and interests, collectivist education has not been emphasized enough; while criticizing excessive collectivization and forcing uniformity, there has not been enough positive guidance. Therefore, the achievements of improving teaching work in the previous period have not been well affirmed. In fact, the Party and Communist Youth League organizations in the past schools have conducted education on revolutionary outlook on life and the socialist future, collectivist education, labor education, and communist moral character education to the broad masses of students, which is completely correct and necessary. This education is fundamental education for young students, and it should continue to be strengthened now and in the future and should not be relaxed. At the same time, the shortcomings in past work must also be overcome.
    Currently, we should strengthen leadership, carry out positive education for students, encourage students to develop positive factors, eliminate unhealthy factors, and strengthen political and ideological work for students through teaching work and school life. School leaders, Party and Communist Youth League organizations, should all focus on teaching work and continue to pay attention to educating students with Marxism-Leninism, establishing a socialist service outlook on life for students, enabling students to recognize the prospects of socialism and communism, educating students to recognize the arduousness of building socialism, promoting the tenacious spirit of hard work, simplicity, overcoming difficulties, and creativity, strengthening students' collectivist education, and developing students' habit of consciously abiding by discipline. Schools should also carry out current affairs and policy education in combination with students' ideological situation, so that students can not only distinguish directions and rights and wrongs in the complex international situation, but also can often understand and care about the actual situation of national political life and construction undertakings in various aspects.
    In carrying out political and ideological education, we must combine the characteristics of school life, adhere to the method of persuasive education, be lively and vigorous, reason intimately, and oppose formalism. Leaders should conduct concrete analysis through practical examples and help students progress intimately and sincerely. As long as we can comprehensively explain the truth to students and improve their ability to analyze things from the standpoint, viewpoints, and methods of the working class, many problems are not difficult to solve. We should not adopt simple and crude methods to deal with students' shortcomings or mistakes, but this does not negate the necessary criticism and education. We must protect and develop students' enthusiasm and support reasonable opinions; at the same time, we must correct and overcome negative and incorrect ideological emotions. We must use the method of mass self-education to carry out criticism and self-criticism. For a small number of students with lower ideological awareness, we must strengthen education on the basis of unity, according to their situation and characteristics.
    Extracurricular activities are important occasions for enriching students' thoughts and lives, cultivating students' proper interests and collectivist spirit. Students have a strong interest in beneficial and diverse extracurricular activities. School leaders, Party and Communist Youth League organizations, must organize and lead various extracurricular activities in a planned and purposeful manner. Of course, the problems of excessive collectivization and forced uniformity must be overcome. When attracting students to participate in extracurricular activities, the principle of voluntariness should be followed, and coercive methods should not be adopted. However, necessary publicity and education should also be carried out, and laissez-faire should not be allowed. The content of extracurricular activities should be rich and colorful, improve quality, and strive to be interesting and educational.
    Physical exercise can improve students' health and can also cultivate students' courage, perseverance, and collectivist spirit. At the same time, physical exercise is also one of the important means of carrying out communist education for students. At present, some students have relaxed their physical exercise. This situation needs to be changed. Schools should continue to promote physical exercise and strengthen the leadership of physical exercise. The content and organizational form of physical exercise should be different according to individual physical fitness, foundation, and hobbies; however, participation in organized comprehensive exercise should also be promoted.
    The exemplary role of League members has a great influence on the formation of good academic style. The League organization should strengthen the education of League members, give play to the enthusiasm and consciousness of League members, implement the spirit of "unity of word and deed," and further promote the atmosphere of loving majors, studying hard, and respecting teachers among students. The Communist Youth League should also earnestly care about the lives of the masses and reflect the opinions and demands of the masses. The student union is the organization of all students themselves, and the Communist Youth League should fully respect and help it carry out various activities.
    In order to better play the role of the Communist Youth League organization, the school Party organization must actively lead the work of the League, give them more ideas, and think of ways. School administrative leaders and teachers should also care about and support the work of the Communist Youth League. The school Party organization should further play its role in student work, improve the awareness of Party members through political and ideological work and organizational work, rely on the exemplary actions of Party members, give play to the active role of League branches, unite the masses, and continuously improve the political and ideological level of students. Education departments and school leaders should strive to promote a good academic style, actively guide young students to move forward on the correct path, and cultivate more and better talents for the socialist construction of the motherland.

    积极引导青年学生前进
    今年秋季开学以来，高等学校在全面发展的方针指导之下，进一步改进了教学工作，注意提高教学质量，在政治思想工作和课外活动中注意克服形式主义和过分集体化的缺点。随着这些新措施的实行，带来了许多新的景象。学生学习积极性和自觉性更加提高了，注意深入钻研，刻苦学习，扩大知识领域。学生的思想和民主生活进一步活跃起来，勇于发表自己的意见，独立思考的风气上升。学校生活摆脱了过分紧张的状态，较以前更加愉快活泼了。
    但是，在改进教学工作的过程中，思想教育工作并没有很好地跟上去。在提出发展个性、照顾个人的特长和爱好的同时，对集体主义教育强调得不够；在批判过分集体化和强求一律的同时，正面引导不够。因此，前一时期改进教学工作的成绩没有很好地被肯定下来。其实，过去学校的党和青年团的组织向广大学生进行了革命人生观和社会主义前途的教育、集体主义教育、劳动教育和共产主义道德品质的教育，这是完全正确的，必需的。这些教育是对青年学生的根本教育，现在和将来都应该继续加强，不应该放松。同时，对于过去工作中的缺点，也必须努力克服。
    目前，我们应该加强领导，向学生进行正面的教育，鼓励学生发扬积极的因素，消除不健康的因素，通过教学工作和学校生活，加强对学生的政治思想工作。学校领导方面，党和青年团的组织，都要环绕教学工作，继续注意以马克思列宁主义的思想来教育学生，树立学生为社会主义服务的人生观，使学生认识社会主义和共产主义的远景，教育学生认识建设社会主义的艰苦性，发扬艰苦朴素、克服困难的顽强精神和创造精神，加强对学生的集体主义教育，养成学生自觉地遵守纪律的习惯。学校还要结合学生的思想情况进行时事政策教育，使学生不仅在复杂的国际形势中辨明方向和是非，而且能经常了解和关心国家政治生活和建设事业各方面的实际情况。
    在进行政治思想教育中，必须结合学校生活的特点，坚持说服教育的方法，生动活泼，亲切说理，反对形式主义。领导方面要通过实际事例，进行具体分析，亲切地、诚恳地帮助学生进步。只要能够全面地向学生讲清楚道理，提高他们以工人阶级的立场、观点和方法去分析事物的能力，许多问题是不难解决的。对待学生的缺点或错误不应采取简单和粗暴的办法，但是，这决不是否定了必要的批评和教育。我们要保护和发扬学生的积极性，支持合理的意见；同时又必须纠正和克服消极的不正确的思想情绪。我们要运用群众自我教育的方法，开展批评和自我批评。对于少数思想觉悟较低的学生，要在团结的基础上，按照他们的情况和特点来加强教育。
    课外活动是丰富学生的思想和生活、培养学生正当的兴趣和集体主义精神的重要场合。学生对于有益的多样的课外活动，有着强烈的兴趣。学校领导方面、党和团的组织，都要有计划、有目的地组织和领导各种课外活动。当然，过分集体化和强求一律的毛病必须克服。在吸引学生参加课外活动的时候，应该按照自愿原则，不能采取强制的办法。但是，也应该进行必要的宣传教育，不能放任自流。课外活动的内容应该丰富多采，提高质量，努力做到富有趣味和教育意义。
    体育锻炼可以改善学生的健康状况，也可以培养学生的勇敢、坚毅和集体主义精神。同时，体育锻炼也是向学生进行共产主义教育的重要手段之一。目前，有一部分学生对体育锻炼放松了。这种情况是需要注意改变的。学校要继续提倡体育锻炼，并且要加强对体育锻炼的领导。体育锻炼的内容和组织形式应该根据各人体质、基础和爱好而有所不同；但是，也应当提倡参加有组织的全面锻炼。
    团员的模范作用对于良好学风的形成有很大的影响。团组织要加强对团员的教育，发挥团员的积极性和自觉性，贯彻“讲和做统一”的精神，在学生中进一步提倡热爱专业、刻苦用功、尊敬师长的风气。青年团也要认真关心群众生活，反映群众的意见和要求。学生会是全体学生自己的组织，青年团要充分尊重和帮助它开展各种活动。
    为了更好地发挥青年团组织的作用，学校党的组织要积极领导团的工作，多给他们出主意，想办法。学校行政领导人员和教师，也要关心和支持青年团的工作。学校党组织要在学生工作中进一步发挥作用，通过政治思想工作和组织工作，提高党员的觉悟，依靠党员的模范行动，发挥团支部的积极作用，团结群众，不断提高学生的政治思想水平。教育部门和学校的领导方面应该努力提倡良好的学风，积极地引导青年学生在正确的道路上前进，为祖国的社会主义建设事业培养出更多更好的人才。
