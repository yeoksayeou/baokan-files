    On the Question of Developing Academics and Literature and Art
    ——Answer to Comrade Bogomil Nonev, Editor-in-Chief of the Bulgarian Magazine "Our Homeland"
    Guo Moruo
    I. Please tell me, what was your motive for asking Comrade Lu Dingyi to make a report (he made the report "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" on May 26, 1956, based on your request)?
    Answer: National construction urgently needs the support of science and technology, and the people's lives also urgently need the supply of cultural nourishment. However, due to deviations in the implementation of policies, there has been a tendency toward dogmatism and formalism, which has affected the development of science and literature and art. Therefore, I believe that it is necessary for the Party to clarify the correct principles and policies, firstly to overcome deviations, and secondly to dispel concerns; in this way, to promote the development of science and literature and art. This is my motive for asking Comrade Lu Dingyi to make a report.
    II. Please give some examples to illustrate the need for the slogan "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." Please tell me about the recent achievements you expect in art and science.
    Answer: In the field of art, there are such typical examples: (1) The arbitrary prohibition of local opera performances. In one place, as a result of arbitrary bans, only two operas could be performed. Needless to say, this restricts the development of drama and affects the lives of drama workers. (2) Traditional Chinese painting has also been extremely despised, causing many painters to be in danger of not being able to maintain their livelihoods.
    In the field of science and technology, there are such typical examples: (1) Traditional Chinese medicine was denounced as "feudal medicine" and suffered extremely serious blows. (2) Mistakes were also made in learning from the Soviet Union by mechanically copying. For a period, Lysenko's theories could not be criticized. A biologist cultivated polyploid wheat in an experiment, but the administrative leaders believed that the method he used was not Lysenko's method and shoveled all the wheat he cultivated.
    Such restrictions and interference in art and science violate the country's policies and, of course, hinder the development of science and technology. In such circumstances, it is fully necessary to clearly put forward the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend."
    The policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" was first proposed by the Communist Party and the People's Government for opera work after liberation. The results of its implementation proved that this policy was correct. Chinese opera has now achieved unprecedented development. In other art departments, if the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" is seriously implemented in the future, I believe that rich results will be achieved relatively quickly.
    The situation in science may be slower. If we earnestly launch a hundred schools of thought contending in the future, we expect to bring the important sectors of our country's science and technology close to the world's advanced level within twelve years.
    III. In your opinion, how do the phenomena of ideological stagnation, one-sided analysis, and isolated problem-solving, which Lenin warned against, arise in art and science? How should we fight against these phenomena?
    Answer: The reason why those bad phenomena condemned by Lenin arise is due to the rampant spread of subjectivism and dogmatism. We have not understood Marxism-Leninism by linking it with practice, and we have not learned to look at problems as comprehensively as possible from the essence, development, and interrelationships.
    To eliminate those bad phenomena, we must overcome subjectivism and dogmatism, and enlighten artists and scientists to learn Marxism-Leninism consciously and voluntarily. Let them gradually understand Marxism-Leninism through their own practice, improve their ideological level, correct their people's stand, and improve their working methods, thereby continuously improving their scientific and technological level.
    IV. In your opinion, what role does the "commandist approach" play in solving ideological problems? Where can it be seen that the correct leadership method has been replaced by the commandist method?
    Answer: Artistic creation and scientific research must go through conscious and independent thinking. Commandism will hinder independent thinking and creativity, and the result will be damage to mental production activities, and sometimes even produce reactions and counter-effects.
    Correct leadership is to inspire consciousness and lively creativity. Just like cultivating rice, if you give it sufficient fertilizer, water, and sunlight, and prevent diseases and insect pests, the rice will grow, develop, blossom, and bear fruit. Commandism fits the ancient Chinese fable called "helping the seedlings grow by pulling them up." As a result, the pulled-up seedlings not only cannot grow, but wither.
    Too much interference and restriction, too many temporary tasks, not engaging in inspiring conscious willingness, and not valuing independent thinking, this is commandism replacing correct leadership.
    V. In your opinion, what are the roots of formalism and dogmatism in our art and science practice?
    Answer: The roots of formalism and dogmatism can be viewed from two aspects: one from the leadership aspect; and the other from the art activities and scientific research aspect.
    China's changes are great, and they are sudden changes; the need for science and technology is great and very urgent. In this way, the administrative leadership is prone to impatience, with too much interference, and good intentions produce bad results.
    In art activities and scientific research, people are busy rushing to deal with things and lack mature independent thinking. Bad results have stimulated impatience.
    In this way, the two are mutually cause and effect, and the phenomena of formalism and dogmatism arise.
    VI. If the implementation of the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" produces unhealthy tendencies in art and politics, how are you prepared to fight against them?
    Answer: The policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is implemented under the people's democratic dictatorship. This kind of freedom of creation and freedom of discussion is premised on serving the people, and it is not unrestricted indulgence. If it is counter-revolutionary creation and speech, it should not have its freedom. Therefore, as a result of the implementation of the policy, we believe that no great unhealthy tendencies will arise. The people have choices, and the country has laws, and these are preservatives.
    The self-education of intellectuals cannot be stopped for a moment. They must be enlightened at any time to inspire their own conscious willingness, study Marxism-Leninism in connection with reality, cultivate the spirit of serving the people and serving national construction, and make their work better.
    If free discussion unfolds and differences of opinion appear, that is nothing to be afraid of. Further展开 discussion, and at a certain stage, opinions will eventually converge. Inconsistencies of opinion are also changeable. Under mutual influence, each other's views on the problem become more in-depth, and there is no need to force artificial consistency.
    When one problem is solved, a new problem will appear. When one inconsistency becomes consistent, a new inconsistency will appear. Such dialectical progress will promote the progress of culture.

    关于发展学术与文艺的问题
    ——答保加利亚“我们的祖国”杂志总编辑包果米尔·诺涅夫同志
    郭沫若
    一、请您告诉我，您请陆定一同志作报告的动机是什么（他根据您的请求在1956年5月26日作出了“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的报告）？
    答：国家建设急切需要科学技术的支援，人民生活也急切需要文化粮食的供应。但由于政策执行上有了偏差，发生了教条主义和公式主义的倾向，影响了科学和文艺的发展。因此，我认为有必要由党来阐明正确的方针政策，一以克服偏差，二以解除顾虑；这样来促进科学和文艺的发展。这就是我请陆定一同志作报告的动机。
    二、请您举出若干例子说明“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的口号的需要。请您告诉我最近在艺术和科学方面所期待的成就。
    答：在艺术方面，有这样典型的例子：（1）随意禁止地方戏的演出，有一个地方由于任意禁演的结果，剩下只有两出戏可演。这样不用说就束缚了戏剧的发展，并影响了戏剧工作者的生活。（2）中国固有的绘画也受到极端的轻视，致使许多画家们几乎有不能维持生活的危险。
    在科学技术方面有这样典型的例子：（1）中国固有医学被斥为“封建医”，曾经遭受过极严重的打击。（2）对学习苏联也犯了机械搬用的毛病，有一个时期李森科的学说是不能批评的。有一位生物学家在实验中培植出了小麦的多倍体，但行政领导上认为他所使用的方法不是李森科的方法，把他所栽培的小麦全部铲除了。
    像这样对于艺术和科学动辄加以限制和干涉是违反国家的政策的，当然也阻碍了科学和技术的发展。在这样的情况下，就有充分的必要明确地提出“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针。
    “百花齐放”的方针是在解放以后共产党和人民政府对戏曲工作首先提出的。执行的结果证明这个方针是正确的。现在中国戏曲获得了空前的发展。在其他艺术部门今后认真执行“百花齐放”的方针，我相信也会比较迅速地收到丰富的成果。
    在科学方面的情况，可能要慢一些。今后认真地展开百家争鸣，我们期待着能在十二年内使我国科学技术的重要部门接近世界先进水平。
    三、根据您的意见，在艺术和科学方面如何会出现列宁所警告的思想停滞、片面分析、孤立看问题的现象？应当如何对这些现象进行斗争？
    答：列宁所谴责过的那些不良现象之所以产生，就是由于主观主义、教条主义的泛滥。对于马克思列宁主义没有从联系实际上去了解，没有学习到从本质上、发展上、相互关连上，尽可能全面地去看问题。
    要消除那些不良现象，就必须克服主观主义、教条主义，启发艺术家和科学家们学习马克思列宁主义的自觉自愿，让他们通过自己的实践去逐步体会马克思列宁主义，提高自己的思想水平，端正自己的人民立场，改进自己的工作方法，从而不断提高自己的科学技术水平。
    四、根据您的意见，“命令主义方式”对解决思想问题起着什么作用？从那里看出正确的领导方法被命令主义方法所代替？
    答：艺术创作和科学研究，必须经过自觉的独立思考。命令主义会妨害独立思考和创造性，其结果会使精神生产的活动遭受损害，有时更生出反作用和逆效果。
    正确的领导是要启发自觉，启发活泼的创造性。就如栽培稻子，你要给予充分的肥料、水分、阳光，并防止病虫害，稻子就会成长、发育、开花、结实。命令主义就合乎中国古代的一个寓言，叫做“拔苗助长”。结果被拔起的苗不仅不能成长，反而枯槁了。
    干涉限制多，临时任务多，不从事启发自觉自愿，不重视独立思考，这就是命令主义代替了正确的领导。
    五、您认为在我们的艺术和科学实践中公式主义和教条主义的根源何在？
    答：公式主义和教条主义的根源可从两方面来看：一是从领导方面；二是从艺术活动和科学研究方面。
    中国的变化大，而且是突变；对科学技术的需要大而且很急迫。这样，就使行政领导方面容易犯急躁的毛病，干涉太多，好心肠生出了坏结果。
    在艺术活动和科学研究方面，忙于急就应付，缺乏成熟的独立思考。坏结果又激发了急躁病。
    就这样两者相为因果，就产生了公式主义和教条主义的现象。
    六、假如由于实行“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策，在艺术和政治方面产生不健康的趋向，您们准备怎样进行斗争？
    答：“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策，是在人民民主专政之下推行的。这种的创作自由和讨论自由是以为人民服务为前提，并不是毫无限制的放纵。如果是反革命的创作和言论，应该没有它的自由。因此，政策推行的结果，我们相信是不会产生多么大的不健康的趋向的。人民有选择，国家有法律，这些都是防腐剂。
    知识分子的自我教育是不能一刻中止的，要让他们随时启发自己的自觉自愿，联系实际地学习马克思列宁主义，培养为人民服务、为国家建设服务的精神，使自己的工作作得更好。
    如果展开自由讨论，呈现出意见分歧，那也没有什么可怕。更进一步展开讨论，到了一定阶段意见终归会一致。意见的不一致，也是具有变化性的，在相互影响之下，使彼此对问题的看法更加深入，不必强求人为的一致。
    一个问题解决了又会有新问题出现。一个不一致一致了，又会有一个新的不一致出现。这样辩证的前进，就会促进文化的进展。
