Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, 20th. The section of the water pipeline project from the Manas River to Karamay, which is twenty kilometers long, has been completed and water has been released. At 11:05 a.m. on the 18th, after the inlet gate at the Zhongguai water station on the tributary of the Manas River—the starting point of this water pipeline—was opened, the river water flowed into the pipeline at a speed of more than one meter per second. At 4:20 p.m., the water flow reached the designated discharge point and poured into the temporary reservoir there. The construction workers of the water pipeline lit three roaring bonfires on the bank of the reservoir to welcome the arrival of the Manas River water.
    
    After this section of the water pipeline is completed and put into operation, the Karamay oilfield can draw water nearby. At present, the construction workers of the water pipeline are still working day and night to complete all the pipelines as soon as possible.

    河水引到克拉玛依
    据新华社克拉玛依20日电　玛纳斯河到克拉玛依的引水管线工程，有二十公里长的一段已经竣工放水。18日上午十一点零五分，在这条引水管线的起点——玛纳斯河支流上的中拐水站打开进水闸门以后，河水流进管道，以每秒一公尺以上的速度前进，下午四点二十分，水流到达了预定放水地点，泻入这里的临时水库。水管线的建筑工人们在水库岸边升起三堆旺盛的篝火，欢迎玛纳斯河水的到来。
    这段水管线修通放水以后，克拉玛依油区用水就可以就近汲取了。目前，引水管线建筑工人还在日夜赶工，争取早日修通全部管道。
