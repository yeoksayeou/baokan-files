Xinhua News Agency, December 20th (Xinhua News Agency Reporter Wang Liang): Nine new coal industrial bases distributed throughout the country are stepping up construction. These new coal industrial bases are expected to be completed successively by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, with most bases having an annual coal production capacity of several million to ten million tons.

In North China, where coal reserves account for more than half of the country's total, new coal industrial bases under construction include Shiguaizi near Baotou in Inner Mongolia, and Fenxi, Lu'an, and Xuangang in Shanxi. These four new coal industrial bases are being built to meet the coking coal needs of the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex and the growing industrial coal demand in North China. Currently, six pairs of mine shafts are under construction at these bases.

In Central China, the newly built coal industrial bases are Pingdingshan, west of Xuchang in Henan Province, and Hebi, west of Anyang. The area surrounding Pingdingshan, covering several thousand square kilometers, contains abundant industrial coal and coking coal. The headframes of three pairs of mine shafts have already been erected, with one pair scheduled to go into production next year. Soon, construction will begin on a modern, large-scale mine. This new coal mine will be one of the supply bases for coking coal for the future Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex. Three pairs of mine shafts are currently under construction in the Hebi mining area.

The current coal production in the Northwest region is very low, and a large portion of the industrial coal currently used is transported from the Northeast and North China. In order to supply power coal to new industrial cities such as Xi'an and Baoji, a new coal industrial base is being built in Tongchuan, the center of the famous "black belt" Weibei coalfield in Shaanxi. Three pairs of mine shafts are under construction at this base. Among them, the Taoyuan adit, which began construction this year, is currently the largest modern mine in the Northwest region. A new coal industrial base being built in Shandan in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province will mainly supply coal for industry in Lanzhou and for trains on the Lanzhou-Urumqi section of the Lanxin Railway.

In the Southwest region, construction recently began on another pair of northern mine shafts in the newly built Zhongliangshan Coal Industrial Base. This pair of mine shafts and the southern mine shafts, which began construction last year, are the largest modern mines in the Southwest. The combined designed capacity of these two pairs of mine shafts is equivalent to more than four-fifths of the coal production of the nine major coal mines in Sichuan this year.

Xinhua News Agency, December 20th: This year, the state-owned coal industry has completed the construction of twenty-four pairs of mine shafts and put them into production. The designed coal mining capacity of these new mine shafts is 7.73 million tons.

Among the mine shafts put into production this year, fourteen pairs are newly built, six pairs are reconstructed, and four pairs are restored mines.

The Xing'antai vertical shaft of the Hegang Coal Mine in Heilongjiang, which was put into production in July, is one of the largest modern vertical shafts built with the help of the Soviet Union. After this pair of mine shafts was put into production, the output is steadily increasing. The coal mining volume in November was nearly double that of August.

The large-scale mine shafts put into production this year also include the Xiejiachi No. 2 and No. 3 vertical shafts of the Huainan Coal Mine, which were designed by Chinese engineers and technicians with the help of Soviet experts. After these two pairs of mine shafts were put into production, the coal mining capacity of this major supply base for industrial coal in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River has greatly increased.

The remaining twenty-one pairs of mine shafts put into production are distributed in ten mining areas including Yangquan in Shanxi, Fuxin in Liaoning, Shuangyashan in Heilongjiang, Pingxiang in Jiangxi, and Jiaozuo in Henan.

Including the mine shafts built and put into production in the first three years of the First Five-Year Plan, the national state-owned coal industry has already completed the construction of one hundred and sixteen pairs of mine shafts and put them into production. Once these mine shafts reach their designed capacity, the output will reach more than 33.39 million tons.

    九个煤炭基地忙建设　二十四对矿井庆完工
    新华社20日讯　新华社记者王良报道：分布在全国各地的九个新的煤炭工业基地正在加紧建设。这些新的煤炭工业基地预计在第二个五年计划末陆续建成，多数基地每年的产煤能力在数百万吨到一千万吨左右。
    在煤的蕴藏量占全国一半以上的华北地区，正在进行建设的新的煤炭工业基地有内蒙古包头附近的石拐子和山西的汾西、潞安和轩岗。这四个新的煤炭工业基地是为了满足包头钢铁联合企业的炼焦用煤和华北地区日益增长的工业用煤而建的。目前在这些基地上正在施工的有六对矿井。
    在华中地区，新建的煤炭工业基地是河南省许昌以西的平顶山和安阳以西的鹤壁。平顶山周围几千平方公里的地区内，蕴藏着丰富的工业用煤和炼焦用煤，现在已经有三对矿井的井架矗立起来了，其中有一对矿井明年就要投入生产。不久，这里还将有一对现代化的大型矿井开工兴建。这个新的煤矿将是未来武汉钢铁联合企业炼焦煤的供应基地之一。鹤壁矿区目前正在施工的有三对矿井。
    西北地区目前煤的产量很少，现在的工业用煤很大一部分是从东北、华北运去的。为了供给西安、宝鸡等新的工业城市的动力用煤，在陕西著名的黑腰带渭北煤田的中心——铜川，正在建设一个新的煤炭工业基地。在这个基地上正在施工的有三对矿井。其中今年开工兴建的桃园平洞是目前西北地区最大的一对现代化矿井。在甘肃河西走廊的山丹新建的一个煤炭工业基地，主要是供应兰州的工业和兰新铁路兰州到乌鲁木齐一段的火车用煤。
    在西南地区新建的中梁山煤炭工业基地，不久前又有一对北矿井开工建设。这对矿井和去年开工的南矿井都是西南最大的现代化矿井。这两对矿井设计能力的总和，相当于四川九个主要煤矿今年产煤量的五分之四以上。
    据新华社20日讯　今年国营煤炭工业有二十四对矿井建设完工并且投入生产。这些新矿井设计的采煤能力达七百七十三万吨。
    今年投入生产的矿井中有十四对是新建井，有六对是改建井，还有四对是恢复的矿井。
    7月间投入生产的黑龙江鹤岗煤矿兴安台竖井，是苏联帮助我国建设的最大的现代化竖井之一。这对矿井投入生产后产量正在稳步上升。11月份的采煤量比8月份提高了近一倍。
    今年投入生产的大型矿井还有我国工程技术人员在苏联专家帮助下自己设计的淮南煤矿谢家集二号和三号竖井。这两对矿井投入生产后，使这个长江下游工业用煤的主要供应基地的采煤能力有了很大增长。
    其余投入生产的二十一对矿井分布在山西阳泉、辽宁阜新、黑龙江双鸭、江西萍乡、河南焦作等十个矿区。
    连同第一个五年计划头三年建成的矿井在内，全国国营煤炭工业已经有一百一十六对矿井建设完工并且投入生产，在这些矿井达到设计能力以后，产量将达三千三百九十多万吨。
