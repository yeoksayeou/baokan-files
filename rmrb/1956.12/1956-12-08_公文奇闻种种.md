　　Various Strange Tales of Official Documents
　　Wang Fang
    I am a clerk. From the materials I have recently organized on document processing, I have discovered some strange tales. These tales seem to be small matters, not worth mentioning. However, they illustrate that some of our agency workers, from the leaders who draft and sign documents to the comrades who use the seals and handle receiving and dispatching, are more or less afflicted with subjectivism, bureaucracy, and carelessness. Please forgive me for using the word "strange" to arouse the vigilance of our agency workers and to jointly strive to prevent the occurrence and spread of this phenomenon.
    Who is Right and Who is Wrong?
    For the solution of a problem, one head has only one idea. If several heads do not exchange opinions and unify their steps, there may be several different ideas. Let me give an example. Regarding the issue of the wage expenditure of enterprise canteen employees, three different proposals have emerged in succession: the Ministry of Labor stipulates that it should be paid from the employee welfare fund; the All-China Federation of Trade Unions instructs that it should be paid from the enterprise administrative expenses; and the Ministry of Finance notifies that it should be paid from the welfare subsidy fund and the enterprise bonus fund.
    Who is right and who is wrong? How are the cadres below supposed to act?
    Where Does the Buck-Passing Come From?
    According to the Guangxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, or rather, a complaint: the cultural paper in our province has been supplied by Hunan and Guangdong provinces for many years. This year, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives not only does not allocate goods from other provinces, but also insists on allocating hundreds of tons from our province to supply Hebei and Shandong provinces, and signed a contract. As a result, there are now no goods to transfer out, and everyone is passing the buck. Where does the buck-passing come from? The answer is self-evident.
    The Art of Multiplying Oneself
    Copying blindly is neither laborious nor appreciated. In our agencies, this behavior is called verbatim copying and forwarding. It is not laborious because it simply adds a head and tail to documents from other agencies; it is not appreciated because such documents are useless except for creating trouble. The Guangxi Provincial Department of Commerce often receives three or four official documents with completely identical content and nature: one is issued by the State Council to the Provincial People's Committee and then forwarded to the department; the second is forwarded by the Ministry of Commerce verbatim from the State Council's original document; the third is copied and forwarded by the General Corporation verbatim from the Ministry of Commerce's original document; and the fourth is copied and reported by the Provincial Corporation copied from the General Corporation's original. Originally one official document, it becomes four identical official documents after passing through several agencies. It's a bit like Sun Wukong plucking monkey hairs and performing magic!
    A Lifetime's Income
    It should be said that the value of telegrams lies in their brevity and speed, but the facts are not always so. This year, the Ministry of Commerce sent many long and urgent telegrams to the Guangxi Provincial Department of Commerce, often with five or six thousand characters. Each telegram costs about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan in telegraph fees. Calculating it, that is equal to a ordinary cadre's lifetime income. Moreover, the telegrams are long and the translating and transmitting are time-consuming, taking four or five days from sending to receiving, which is not much different from the time of ordinary mail. Wasting money and time, what is the point?
    Guilin is Enchanting
    The capital of Guangxi Province is Nanning, not Guilin. This has been the case since the establishment of the Guangxi Provincial People's Government in 1950. However, this year the Guangxi Provincial Department of Industry has repeatedly received documents issued by several central ministries forwarded from Guilin City. It is understandable that ordinary people do not care about the change of the capital of Guangxi Province, but several ministries of the country still regard Guilin as Nanning. Could it be that they are confused by "Guilin's scenery is the best in the world!"?
    Five Thousand Miles of Road, Clouds and Moon
    On April 20th this year, the Guangxi Provincial Department of Industry submitted a report to the Ministry of Heavy Industry applying for the allocation of 90 tons of potassium chloride, but received no reply for a long time. On May 8th, they sent a telegram to inquire, and on May 16th, they received a letter from the Ministry of Heavy Industry with the original application form for the allocation of potassium chloride, saying: "This is a matter for the Ministry of Light Industry." Logically, the person handling it should: 1. transfer the application form to the Ministry of Light Industry; 2. notify the Guangxi Provincial Department of Industry. But as things stand, the Guangxi Provincial Department of Industry had no choice but to report to the Ministry of Light Industry again. Thus, the application form, which had returned from Beijing, was forced to embark on the journey to Beijing again. By the time it reached the Ministry of Light Industry, the potassium chloride had already been allocated. It is indeed: a long march of five thousand miles, covered in dust, going with enthusiasm and returning in disappointment.

### 公文奇闻种种

　　公文奇闻种种
　　王方
    我是一个文书工作者，从最近我所整理的一些文书处理工作的资料中，发现了一些奇闻，这些奇闻，看来似乎都是小事情，不足挂齿。然而正是它说明了我们某些机关工作者上至执笔签发的领导，下至用印、收发的同志，都多多少少地患了主观主义、官僚主义和粗枝大叶的病症。恕我援引这“奇闻”二字，以引起我们机关工作者的警惕，共同努力制止这种现象的发生和蔓延。
    谁是谁非？
    对于一个问题的解决，一个头只有一个主意，几个头，如果不交换意见，统一步调，就可能有几个不同的主意了。姑且举个例子说吧，关于企业炊事员工资的开支问题，就接连出现三种不同的主张：劳动部规定在职工福利费开支；全国总工会指示在企业行政费开支；财政部则通知在福利补助基金和企业奖励基金开支。
    究竟谁是谁非？叫下面干部如何是好？
    扯皮何来？
    据广西省供销社反映或者说是诉苦：我省文化用纸历年由湖南、广东省供应，今年全国供销总社非但不分配外省货源，还硬分配我省要供应河北、山东省数百吨，并签订了合同。结果，现在无货外调，大家扯皮。扯皮何来？不答自知。
    分身法
    依样画葫芦，既不费力，亦不讨好。在我们机关里，这种行为叫做照抄照转，其所以不费力，因为只是把别机关的文件加个头补个尾；其所以不讨好，因为这样的文件除了增加麻烦外，毫无用处。广西省商业厅经常收到三、四件内容性质完全一样的公文，一是国务院下达省人民委员会后转该厅办的；二是商业部照转国务院原文发下的；三是总公司抄转商业部原文发下的；四是省公司抄转总公司原文抄报上来的。本来是一件公文经过几个机关变成了四件一模一样的公文。真有点像孙悟空拔猴毛变法呢！
    一辈子的收入
    应该说，电报贵在简捷，但事实也不完全是这样。商业部今年给广西省商业厅拍发了不少特急的长电报，动辄五、六千字。每份电报报费约二、三万元。算一下等于一个普通干部一辈子的收入。并且电报长，译拍费时，从发至收，也要四、五天，和一般邮信时间相差无几。费钱费时，不知所为何来？
    桂林迷人
    广西省省会在南宁而不是桂林，这已经是1950年广西省人民政府成立以来的事情了。可是，广西省工业厅今年却接连收到由桂林市转来的中央几个部下发的文件。普通人没有关心广西省会的改变是情有可原的，而国家的几个部却仍把桂林当南宁，莫非是为“桂林山水甲天下”所迷糊了么！？
    五千里路云和月
    广西省工业厅今年4月20日打报告向重工业部申请拨给氯化钾九十吨，久未见复。5月8日拍电报催问，5月16日收到重工业部一封便函并附回原申请分配氯化钾计划表，说：“这是轻工业部的事。”按理，处理的人，应该：一将申请计划表转轻工业部；二通知广西省工业厅。但事已至此，无奈，广西省工业厅只好再报轻工业部。于是，远从北京回来的那张申请计划表，迫不由己，又踏上到北京去的征途，待得到了轻工业部时，氯化钾早已分配完了。正是：五千里路长征，风尘仆仆，乘兴而去，败兴而归。
