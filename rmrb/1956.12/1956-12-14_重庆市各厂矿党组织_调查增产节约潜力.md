Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 13th. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Hu Mingjun reports): Party organizations in Chongqing's factories and mines are comprehensively investigating and studying enterprise potential and the ideological state of workers, seeking directions and paths for increasing production and practicing economy.

Recently, many factory and mine party organizations have investigated waste phenomena and potential that can be tapped in current production through enlarged party committee meetings and various worker representative symposiums. Many machinery factories, through investigation and research, have found that the waste of metal materials is quite serious this year due to improper product design, using large materials for small purposes, and high scrap rates. However, the state's allocation of metal materials next year is limited. Therefore, it is believed that metal should be saved in all aspects to increase production. Chongqing Universal Machinery Factory has decided to reduce metal consumption by improving product design, using substitutes, and recycling waste metal. According to preliminary estimates, just improving the design of the No. 3 pumping unit alone is expected to save enough steel next year to produce sixty more oil pumping units. After investigation and research, the party committees of various cotton mills believe that there is potential for large-scale increased production with the current equipment, but raw material supply may be limited. Although the quality of yarn and cloth has improved this year, the amount of cotton and yarn used has increased. Based on these circumstances, the party committees of most textile factories have proposed to focus on saving cotton and yarn while ensuring quality, and also to pay attention to reducing water and electricity consumption and management costs. The party committee of Tianfu Coal Mine analyzed that the main problems of the mine this year are poor safety work, the potential of equipment has not been well utilized, and the waste of pit wood is large. Therefore, the mine's party committee decided to strengthen the above three aspects of work as the main content of increasing production and practicing economy.

Many factory and mine party organizations have learned from the investigation that the ideological state of most cadres and workers in the factories and mines is healthy and normal. However, in some cadres and young workers, a trend of demanding high salaries and spending money recklessly is also growing; extravagance and waste exist in production design and management. Some technicians in machinery factories often only emphasize complex and beautiful designs in new product design, but pay little attention to economic practicality. The atmosphere of emphasizing economy and quality in some factories and mines has gradually faded. The foundry workshop of Chongqing Machine Tool Factory scrapped more than seventy tons of products in the first ten months of this year, equivalent to two months of the entire workshop's output, but the workshop leaders have not taken strong measures to reverse this situation. Recently, a few workers have also failed to comply with operating procedures, been absent from work, and even engaged in moral corruption, illegal acts, and violations of discipline. The party committees of many factories and mines analyzed that the root cause of these bad tendencies is that the party organizations have relaxed the political and ideological education of workers in recent years. Therefore, the party committees of many factories and mines have decided to strengthen political and ideological leadership and patiently educate workers to establish a work style of hard work, simplicity, and diligence in running factories, as the primary and regular work in leading the campaign to increase production and practice economy.

### 重庆市各厂矿党组织  调查增产节约潜力

    重庆市各厂矿党组织
    调查增产节约潜力
    新华社重庆13日电　新华社记者胡明俊报道：重庆市厂矿企业中党的组织，正在全面调查研究企业潜力和职工思想情况，寻找增产节约的方向和途径。
    许多厂矿的党组织，最近都通过党委扩大会和各种职工代表座谈会，调查了目前生产上存在的浪费现象和可以挖掘的潜力。多数机械工厂在调查研究中，发现今年因产品设计不当、大材小用和报废率大，金属材料的浪费相当严重，而明年国家调拨的金属材料有限，因此认为应该从各方面节约金属，增加生产。重庆通用机器厂已经决定从改进产品设计、利用代用品、回收废金属等方面来减少金属消耗量，根据初步确定，仅改进三号抽油机的设计一项，预计明年节约的钢材就可以多生产六十台石油抽油机。各棉纺厂党委经过调查研究，认为就目前的设备潜力，能够大量增产，但是原料供应可能受到限制。各厂今年的纱、布质量虽然有提高，但是用棉用纱量却增大了。根据这些情况，多数纺织厂的党委提出要在保证质量的基础上把重点放在节约用棉用纱上，同时注意降低水、电消耗和管理费用。天府煤矿党委分析全矿今年的主要问题是安全工作差，设备潜力没有很好发挥，坑木浪费大。因此，这个矿的党委决定把加强以上三方面工作作为增产节约的主要内容。
    许多厂矿的党组织从调查中了解，各厂矿大部分干部和职工的思想情况是健康的，正常的，但是近来在一部分干部和青年工人中，也在滋长着闹待遇、乱花钱的风气；在生产设计和管理等方面存在着铺张浪费的现象。机械厂有些技术人员在新产品设计中，往往只讲求设计得复杂、美观，却不大讲求经济实用。有些厂矿重视节约、重视质量的风气逐渐淡漠。重庆机床厂翻砂车间今年十个月来就报废了七十多吨产品，相当于全车间两个月的产量，车间领导方面却没有大力采取措施加以扭转。近来还有少数职工不遵守操作规程，旷工，甚至发生道德败坏、违法乱纪的事件。许多厂矿的党委分析这些不良倾向滋长的根本原因，是近年来党的组织放松了对职工的政治思想教育工作。因此，许多厂矿的党组织决定把加强政治思想领导，耐心教育职工树立艰苦朴素、勤俭办厂的作风，作为领导增产节约工作中首要的和经常的工作。
