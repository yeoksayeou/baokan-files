Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 17th - In Guantai Township, Mianyang County, Sichuan Province, township cadres changed their methods of leading production this year, ensuring that agricultural cooperative cadres and commune members alike increased their incomes. Among the 387 cooperative cadres in the township's 47 cooperatives, 90% saw an increase in income, generally about 18% higher than last year.

    In the past, the leading cadres of Guantai Township relied on meetings to lead agricultural production, summoning cooperative cadres to meetings whenever something came up. This meant that township and cooperative cadres could not go deep to lead, promptly discover, and solve problems. It also prevented cooperative cadres from participating in production, resulting in poor production within the cooperative and reduced income for the cooperative cadres' families. This led to frustration on both ends, affecting their work enthusiasm. In order to change this situation, the township party branch decided to streamline all unnecessary meetings starting from this year's spring ploughing production. General work tasks were assigned to township cadres to be conveyed to the villages, and the township party branch secretary, deputy secretary, and the district committee work group leader all divided up the agricultural cooperatives to provide specific leadership. Because the township and cooperative cadres worked more deeply and leadership was more specific, increased production in the township's agricultural cooperatives was ensured. The amount of work the cooperative cadres themselves did also increased compared to last year, generally earning about 70% of the labor points of ordinary commune members. Jia Antai, the director of the Xinsheng First Agricultural Cooperative, spent most of his time in meetings during the spring ploughing season last year, and no one led the planting in the cooperative. As a result, the rice yield was reduced due to late planting, and his own income was also reduced due to less work. But this year, he actively led production, working for twenty days out of the month, and the cooperative's production increased by 40% this year, and his income also increased.

    The party branch also launched a serious evaluation of the issue of subsidies for cooperative cadres' work delays due to official duties among commune members, preventing the tendency to broaden the scope of subsidies, with everyone grabbing a little bit. This ensured that cooperative cadres who truly deserved subsidies received what they were due.

    After the cooperative cadres' incomes increased, their enthusiasm for leading production became even greater. Deng Yuancheng (middle peasant), the director of the Dayi Second Agricultural Cooperative, used to always worry about reducing his income and was uneasy in his work. After seeing his income increase, he became more active in his work.

    精简会议和加强具体领导的结果
    干部和社员的收入都增加了
    新华社成都17日电　四川省绵阳县观太乡，今年乡干部改变了领导生产的方法，保证了农业社的社干部和社员一同增加了收入。在全乡四十七个社的三百八十七名社干部中，增加收入的占90％，他们一般比去年增加收入18％左右。
    过去，观太乡的领导干部领导农业生产的方法是靠会议，有事就召集社干部来开会。这样乡、社干部既不能深入领导及时发现和解决问题，又牵扯得社干部不能参加生产，结果社内生产搞不好，社干部家里也减少了收入，弄得两头受气，影响了工作情绪。中共乡支部为了改变这种状况，从今年春耕生产开始，便决定精简一切不必要的会议，一般工作任务都由乡干部分工到村传达，乡支部书记、副书记、区委工作组组长等，都分工划片到各农业社中去具体领导。由于乡、社干部工作深入，领导具体，因而保证了全乡农业社的增产。社干部自己出工作的活路也都比去年增多，一般都能挣到普通社员劳动工分的70％左右。新生第一农业社主任贾安太，去年春耕期间，一多半时间都用在开会上，社内播种无人领导，结果水稻因种得过迟而减了产，他自己的收入也因出工少而减少；但今年他在生产中积极领导，一月中有二十天都作活路，全社今年增产40％，他的收入也增加了。
    党支部还对社干部因公误工补贴问题，发动社员认真进行了评定，防止了补贴面宽，大家多少都抓一把的偏向，让真正应该补贴的社干部得到了应得的补贴。
    社干部收入增加以后，领导生产的劲头更大了。大益第二农业社主任邓远成（中农），原来总怕减少收入，工作不安心，看到收入增加以后，工作积极了。
