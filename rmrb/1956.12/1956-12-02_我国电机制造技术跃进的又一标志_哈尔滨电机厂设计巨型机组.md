　　Another Sign of the Leap Forward in China's Motor Manufacturing Technology
　　Harbin Electric Machinery Plant Designs Giant Unit
　　(Our Newspaper) This newspaper reports: The giant hydro-turbine generator units to equip the Xin'anjiang Hydroelectric Power Station are being designed intensely by the designers of the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant. This is a new symbol of the leap forward of China's motor manufacturing industry towards modernization.
　　The Xin'anjiang Hydroelectric Power Station will be equipped with eight 72,000-kilowatt units, with a total installed capacity of 580,000 kilowatts, exceeding China's largest Fengman Hydroelectric Power Station. After the completion of this hydroelectric power station, it will form the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Nanjing power grid with it as the center, supplying industrial electricity to Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and the Tongguanshan area, and use the reservoir to regulate floods and develop farmland irrigation and inland river transportation.
　　The young designers of the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant, under the close guidance of the old designers, compiled the preliminary design of this giant unit. Shi Zuohu and Fan Rongchun, who presided over the preliminary design of the water turbine, were both undertaking design work independently for the first time. During the dozen or so months of the design process, they conscientiously studied the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and adopted the latest Soviet technological achievements in many places. For example, the water turbine adopts the Soviet standard model rotor, and each unit can produce 76,000 kilowatts. Engineer Cheng Menghao, who is in charge of the preliminary design of the generator, is conducting the final selection of the motor type with several young technicians.
　　Gaelman, an expert from distant Leningrad who came to Harbin, provided enthusiastic assistance in the design of the giant unit. He unreservedly introduced the valuable data such as the preliminary design calculation book of the Soviet Kuibyshev Hydropower Station to the designers of the factory, and provided many valuable suggestions. At the beginning of the preliminary design, Expert Gaelman also went to the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station construction site for field investigation with Chinese designers.
　　At present, the design work of this giant hydro-turbine generator unit is being intensified. The preliminary design of the water turbine has been completed, and part of the technical design has begun. The preliminary design of the hydro-generator is also about to be completed.

　  我国电机制造技术跃进的又一标志
　　哈尔滨电机厂设计巨型机组
    本报讯　装备新安江水电站的巨型水轮发电机组，正由哈尔滨电机厂的设计师们紧张设计中。这是我国电机制造工业向着现代化水平跃进的新标志。
    新安江水电站将安装八套七万二千瓩的机组，机装总容量五十八万瓩，超过我国最大的丰满水电站。这个水电站建成后，将以它为中心组成沪、杭、宁动力网，供应上海、杭州、南京及铜官山一带工业用电，并利用水库调节洪水，发展农田灌溉和内河航运。
    哈尔滨电机厂的青年设计师，在老设计师们亲切指导下，编制了这个巨型机组的初步设计。主持水轮机初步设计的施作沪和范荣春，都是第一次独立地进行设计工作。在十几个月设计过程中，他们认真学习苏联先进经验，许多地方都采用了苏联最新的技术成就。如水轮机采用了苏联标准型号的转子，每台出力可达七万六千瓩。主持发电机初步设计的程梦灏工程师，正在和几个青年技术员进行着电机型式的最后选择。
    从遥远的列宁格勒来到哈尔滨的专家盖尔曼，在巨型机组设计上给予了热情的帮助。他把苏联古比雪夫水电站初步设计计算书等珍贵资料，毫无保留地介绍给该厂的设计师，并提供了许多宝贵的意见。在初步设计刚开始进行时，盖尔曼专家还和中国设计师一起到新安江水电站工地实地考察。
    现在，这个巨型水轮发电机组的设计工作正在加紧进行，水轮机的初步设计已告完成，并部分开始了技术设计。水轮发电机的初步设计也即将完成。　（黑龙江日报）
