    "Occasional Thoughts from Tianxianglou"
  　Yao Xueyin
    Mr. Xidi's discussion of "Kangxi's Leisurely Study of Things" in "Strolling Through the Book Forest" reminded me of "Occasional Thoughts from Tianxianglou" by Yu Zhaohong, a native of Jiaxing in the early Qing Dynasty. Although this is a thin book, the range of topics it covers is quite extensive. It discusses astronomy, exegesis of names and objects, animals and plants, customs and dialects, and also writing. Because it is a miscellany of personal insights, it is not a systematic work and is not valued by people in academic circles. However, this book contains some brilliant insights, which show that the author possessed a pragmatic scientific spirit, dared to express doubts and criticisms of authority, and liked to use independent thinking to solve problems.

    Han Yu, who supposedly "revived the decline of the Eight Dynasties," has been revered as an authority on classical prose since the Song Dynasty. His "Preface to Sending off Meng Dongye" is even recognized as a representative work of his prose. However, Yu Zhaohong had sharp criticisms of this article. He said that in this article of only six hundred and twenty words, the word "qi" (其) was used forty-five times. Although it is a grammatical particle and does not hinder understanding, it is ultimately too careless. He also said that sentences such as "Yi Yin made Yin famous, and the Duke of Zhou made Zhou famous" and "Chu was a great country, and its demise was made famous by Qu Yuan" were quite fabricated and cobbled together, and had no meaning at all. For someone living two or three hundred years ago to publicly criticize the careless and nonsensical sentence structure of Han Yu's famous work required a pragmatic spirit of not blindly worshiping idols.

    On the one hand, Yu Zhaohong dared to criticize authority and doubt the traditional views of the ancients; on the other hand, based on his own personal observations, research, and repeated thinking, he put forward new views on some issues. Due to the limitations of the times, his opinions are not all correct or valuable, but some opinions cannot but amaze us. For example, regarding the relationship between thunder and lightning, he disagreed with the traditional view that lightning precedes thunder, believing that lightning is the light emitted by thunder. Because people see light faster than they hear sound, they mistakenly believe that lightning precedes thunder. He said: "Now, when people set off firecrackers in the dark, the light and sound arrive at the same time when viewed up close, but when viewed from a distance, the flash of light is seen first, and the sound is heard slowly afterward, which is the same principle as thunder and lightning (the 'electricity' he refers to is lightning)." This explanation already pointed out that the speed of light is greater than the speed of sound, so the flash is seen first, and the thunder is heard later. Someone asked: Why is there sometimes just lightning without thunder, and sometimes both lightning and thunder? He replied that the larger mutual excitation of yang energy produces thunder, and the smaller excitation only produces lightning. At that time, he did not know about negative and positive electricity, and collectively called this natural phenomenon yang energy, but he already understood that the generation of thunder was due to the mutual excitation of two forces. He also said: "As for the reverberation of thunder, it is similar to the reverberation of firecrackers. Nowadays, people who set off firecrackers in the mountains often hear a single sound swirling and rising and falling several times. How much more so is this true of thunder in the vast sky? Knowing this, the reverberation of thunder is all from a single sound, not like the continuous sound of a drum."

    The concave mirror for obtaining fire from the sun was invented in China very early, at least as early as the early Western Han Dynasty. The ancients called it yangsui (阳燧). Shen Kuo of the Song Dynasty said in "Dream Pool Essays" that when using yangsui to illuminate objects, the images are inverted because there is an obstruction in the middle of the yangsui. After careful personal observation and reflection, Yu Zhaohong opposed this view. He said: "My family has a yangsui. When using it to illuminate objects, the image is upright when close; flickering and unstable when slightly further away; and completely inverted when even further away, but the illumination is very blurred, not as clear as when close. Thinking carefully about the reason, it is not because there is an obstruction in the middle. Because the surface of the yangsui is concave, when it encounters objects, all the light first shines inward from the four sides. Therefore, the image illuminated in the middle is not obtained by directly illuminating the external object, but by reflecting the image of the object illuminated by the four sides. The light illuminated from above is reflected to the bottom in the middle; the light illuminated from below is reflected to the top in the middle; and the same is true for left and right. Only the light that directly illuminates the external object is not used, only the image of the object illuminated by the four sides is used, so the light is very blurred."

    Yu Zhaohong correctly explained the refraction phenomenon of concave mirrors. In today's view, this is a common sense problem in physics, but Yu Zhaohong lived in the seventeenth century, and this opinion was obtained through his own observation and reflection, so it is particularly valuable.

    The reason why "Occasional Thoughts from Tianxianglou" caught my attention is not for any other reason, but precisely because the author did not blindly believe in authority, was able to think independently in earnest, and put forward some fresh insights.

    “天香楼偶得”
  　姚雪垠
    西谛先生在“漫步书林”中谈到“康熙几暇格物论”，使我想到清初嘉兴人虞兆洚的“天香楼偶得”这部书。这虽是一部薄薄的书，所谈的范围却相当广泛。它谈天文，谈名物训诂，谈动物和植物，谈风俗和土语，也谈文章。因为是杂记个人偶得之见，所以并不是一种有体系的著作，在学术上也不为人们重视。但是在这部书中包含着一些精彩的见解，可以看出来作者具有实事求是的科学精神，敢于对权威表示怀疑和批评，喜欢运用独立思考去解决问题。
    所谓“文起八代之衰”的韩愈，从宋代以来已经被推崇成古文权威。他的“送孟东野序”，更被公认为他的散文的代表作品。但是虞兆洚对这篇文章却有尖锐批评。他说这一篇止有六百二十多字的文章中连用了四十五个“其”字，虽说是语助词，没有妨碍，但究竟太草率了。他又说像“伊尹鸣殷，周公鸣周”；“楚大国也，其亡也以屈原鸣”等句子，颇为杜撰、杂凑，绝无意义。生在两三百年前的人像这样公然批评韩愈的名作的句法草率和不通，是需要有一种不盲目崇拜偶像的实事求是精神的。
    虞兆洚一方面敢于批评权威和怀疑古人的传统见解，一方面根据他自己的亲身观察、研究，反复思考，对一些问题提出了新的看法。由于时代的限制，他的意见并不全对，也并不都有价值，但有的意见却不能不使我们感到惊奇。例如关于雷和闪电的关系，他不同意从古来认为有闪电而后有雷的说法，认为闪电就是发雷的光，因为人们看见光比听见响声快，所以误以为有闪电而后有雷。他说：“如今人于天黑时放爆竹，近看则火光与响同至，若远看则先见火光一闪，而响必徐徐后闻，与雷电（他说的电指闪电）一理也。”这种解释已经指出来光的速度大于声的速度，所以先见闪光，后闻雷声。有人问：为什么有时只扯闪不打雷，有时又扯闪又打雷呢？他回答说，阳气互相激发的大就发出雷声，激发的小就只发出闪光。当时他还不知道阴电阳电，笼统地把这种自然现象叫做阳气，但是他已经明白雷声的产生是由于两种力量的互相激发。他又说：“至于雷之传响则又与爆竹之传响相似。今人于山间放爆竹者，一声旋绕，辄作数次起灭，况雷之在太空乎？知此，则雷之传声总属一声，非若擂鼓然矣。”
    从太阳取火的凹面镜在中国发明很早，至少在西汉初年已经有这种东西。古人把它叫做阳燧。宋人沈括在“梦溪笔谈”中说拿阳燧照物，影像都是颠倒的，那是由于阳燧的中间有障碍。虞兆洚经过亲自认真观察和思索之后，反对这种说法。他说：“余家蓄一阳燧，以之照物，迫近则正；稍远则闪烁无定；再远之则皆倒矣，但所照甚为模糊，不若近照之明显。细思其故，非中间有碍也。盖阳燧面洼（凹），凡遇诸物，悉从四边先照入内，故中间所照之影非照外物而得，乃转照四边所照之物影也。上边所照，则中间转在下；下边所照，则中间转在上；左右转照亦然。惟不竟（径）照外物，止照四边所照物影，故光甚模糊。”
    虞兆洚正确地解释了凹面镜的折光现象。在今天看来，这是物理学上的常识问题，但是虞兆洚是生在十七世纪，而且这意见是通过他自己的观察和思索后获得的，所以就特别可贵。
      “天香楼偶得”这本书之所以引起我的注意，没有别的理由，正是由于作者不迷信权威，能够认真地独立思考，提出了一些新鲜见解。
