Rapidly Developing Teleautomatics
　　Wang Chuanshan
    Using new technologies, people can not only make machines automatically perform various complex tasks according to predetermined intentions, to replace human physical labor and some mental labor, but also use new technologies to know the working conditions of these machines thousands of miles away and command them with ease. The new technology mentioned here, the former is called automatics, or automatic control; the latter is called teleautomatics, or "telecontrol" for short.
    Teleautomatics gradually formed and gained relatively widespread application in the 1930s. Telecontrol technology is usually divided into remote control, remote signaling, remote measurement, and remote adjustment. The "remote" mentioned here refers to distances from a few kilometers to thousands of kilometers or more. At this time, people can no longer use general near-ground measurement, control, and other methods, and need to adopt special technical measures to transform signals or commands appropriately, transmit them through communication channels to the other end, and then convert them back. The generation of commands or signals can be manual or fully automatic. The adoption of such technology will expand the control and monitoring scope of technical engineers to thousands of miles away, connecting huge enterprise departments into a whole, which can not only implement centralized dispatching control, but also realize the automation of the entire enterprise, greatly improving labor productivity.
    The power system is the earliest and most widely used application of telecontrol technology. Modern power systems are composed of a large number of giant power plants, high-voltage transmission networks, and countless substations, distributed over a large area, supplying millions of kilowatts of power to various industrial sectors. They require extremely high reliability and efficiency, which can only be achieved through telecontrol technology to ensure the most reasonable and safe operation. About twenty years ago, remote measurement and control began to be used in power systems. Now, the main power stations and trunk lines of large power systems in many countries have installed telecontrol equipment, and there have been many completely unmanned hydroelectric power stations and substations that implement remote control. The start and stop of generators, the operation of circuit breakers, the distribution of power, etc., in these unmanned hydroelectric power stations are all managed by dispatching stations or other power stations located far away. All the information that needs to be known about hydroelectric power stations, such as the working conditions of components, water levels, etc., are obtained by means of remote signaling and remote measurement. The distance for remote control or measurement in power systems usually reaches hundreds of kilometers, and occasionally more than a thousand kilometers. The scope of use of telecontrol technology includes remote measurement of power, voltage, frequency, water level, etc., remote transmission of fault signals and position signals, remote operation of circuit breakers, gates, transformer switching, switching of operating modes, and adjustment of the function of automatic devices, etc. The Soviet Union is the country that uses telecontrol technology most widely in power systems. Telecontrol technology has begun to be used not only in major power plants and transmission lines, but also in lower voltage distribution lines. According to the results of many years of application, the adoption of telecontrol technology can indeed greatly improve the efficiency of the power system, and can also eliminate faults in a timely manner, ensuring safe power supply.
    The railway transportation department was also an early and extensive adopter of telecontrol technology. Around 1935, centralized control was realized on the Moscow-Kazansky railway over a distance of more than 60 kilometers. Now, in addition to remote control of railway signals and switchgears, telecontrol technology is applied to control traction substations for electrified railways and subways. Some of these substations also do not require any on-duty personnel. Experience has proven that remote centralized control of railway signals, switchgears, substations, etc., can greatly save manpower, increase train speed and safety, thereby improving the transportation efficiency of railways. The adoption of telecontrol technology in the petroleum industry, gas industry, and other sectors also has special significance. Modern oil pipelines, gas pipelines, etc., are hundreds of kilometers long and must have remote monitoring and control equipment in order to centrally control the entire system. Many siphon stations along these oil and gas pipelines need to be remotely controlled, and remote measurement of flow, pressure, flow rate, liquid level, etc., is required, as well as remote adjustment of oil or gas pressure, flow rate, etc. The application of telecontrol technology in large enterprises such as metallurgy, mining, and chemical industries is also increasing day by day. It started with centralized control of heat and power supply systems, and now it requires remote monitoring and control of individual departments or components. Telecontrol technology is also increasingly required to assist in navigation canals, irrigation systems, etc. Taking the Moscow Canal as an example, the use of telecontrol devices has completely eliminated human-caused failures and shortened the start-up time of pumping stations to one-tenth of the original time. In rural electrification and public utilities in large cities, there is also a growing demand to master telecontrol technology. Telecontrol technology is not only to be applied in large-scale production sectors where the various components are far apart and widely distributed, but also in some other special situations, when it is necessary to control or monitor certain dangerous targets or places that humans cannot reach, it must be used. Now, remote measurement technology is already being used in many places for meteorological research in high altitudes and deep mountains, and remote control is being used for ultra-high voltage and atomic energy experiments; unmanned flight tests for new types of aircraft, and so on. According to recent reports, scientists are also studying the telecontrol technology necessary for artificial satellites.
    Telecontrol technology is also very important in the military field. As early as World War II, Germany's V-2 missiles used simple remote control principles to calibrate their flight path and distance; the United States also used telecontrol technology in its measures to defend against Japanese submarine attacks on its west coast. Now, telecontrol technology is used in controlling and testing missiles and nuclear weapons, etc.
    Up to now, most of the telecontrol technology applied in various fields still requires human control. In foreign countries, scientists are researching and experimenting with true remote automatic control. Some are relatively simple, such as remote automatic interlocking, etc., which have already been in use; some are very complex and require the assistance of electronic computers. Implementing remote automatic dispatching in the power system can allow the entire system to operate automatically in the most economical way without dispatching personnel, and ensure high safety and reliability. It is also possible to use telecontrol technology to connect radar, electronic computers, and missiles, so that the latter can automatically track targets. Although such complete remote automatic control is still in the experimental stage, its eventual success can be expected. It is believed that when such technology matures, it will play a huge role in industrial construction and national defense.
    In some countries (such as the United States), teleautomatics has not been regarded as an independent discipline, but only as a comprehensive technical application; but in the Soviet Union, teleautomatics is regarded as a completely independent scientific department. Scientists have proposed that, based on the principles of automatic control, information theory, and relay circuit principles, a general theory of teleautomatics should be gradually established. Such a theory will be able to solve a series of major basic theoretical problems concerning the analysis and synthesis of telecontrol systems, the transformation, transmission, and selection of telecontrol signals, accuracy, reliability, and operating speed, and the combination of telecontrol systems, automatic control systems, and electronic computers. Such a theory will enable telecontrol technology to advance more rapidly.
    In the past, teleautomatics was a missing discipline in China, no one had studied it, and telecontrol technology had not been used. At the end of 1953, the Teleautomatics Research Group of the Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences was established and began research in this area. In 1954 and 1955, the focus was on research on remote measurement, and a pulse frequency remote measurement system was studied and tested. The test results showed that the accuracy reached the general requirements of foreign countries, and a power line carrier equipment for simultaneously transmitting six channels of telemetry signals was designed and tested. The laboratory-made model has been installed and used in a power plant and substation of the Northeast Power System; in addition, an electronic remote measurement adder has been successfully developed. In 1956, in addition to continuing the research work on remote measurement, research on remote control was also started. Up to now, a small-capacity signaling system has been successfully researched and designed, and a model has been produced by the Beijing Electric Power Bureau and installed for use in a substation in Beijing. This is China's first remote-controlled substation. After a period of use, the on-duty personnel can be withdrawn and changed to a completely unmanned remote-controlled substation. In addition, a magnetic static remote measurement power converter has been successfully tested in the laboratory and will also be installed and tested in the power system. Research on a completely new type of remote measurement system that adopts time division methods is currently underway, and some basic theoretical research on teleautomatics has also begun. In addition to the Academy of Sciences, the Technical Improvement Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry also started research and testing of remote measurement this year. Achievements have been made in frequency remote measurement and rectifier remote measurement equipment methods. The trial-produced Soviet-style frequency remote measurement equipment has also been installed and used, with good performance. Under the instruction of the Party and the government to catch up with or approach the world's advanced scientific and technological level within twelve years, the development of teleautomatics in China will be exceptionally rapid. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China also clearly proposed in its proposals for the development of the Second Five-Year Plan that the foundation for this new technology should be established in China. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has established a research institute on automatics and teleautomatics, which will vigorously carry out research in this area. Various industrial departments are also actively preparing to establish research institutions to conduct research on related telecontrol technologies. Some universities are also preparing to offer courses related to this field. Telecontrol technology will gradually be applied in various national economic sectors. Unmanned hydroelectric power stations, remote-controlled electric railways, and remote-controlled workshops, mines, oil pipelines, irrigation systems, etc., will appear one after another.
    However, to realize such a beautiful development prospect, some conditions need to be created first. The first is the problem of a lack of research and technical personnel. At present, there are very few research workers in this field in China, and the strength is very weak, and the source of new strength is also somewhat difficult. It is hoped that universities can consider establishing majors in automatics and teleautomatics as soon as possible, offer more courses in teleautomatics, and appropriately consider supplementing some senior students in other majors with teleautomatics knowledge, so as to meet the requirements of the outside world as soon as possible. Regarding the issue of teachers, in addition to solving it through training within the school, Soviet experts can be invited to guide, or cooperation with the Academy of Sciences can be carried out to invite researchers to offer some specialized courses. Various enterprise departments can also train themselves or entrust the Academy of Sciences to train them. In the past, the Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering has accepted many people from universities and industrial departments to study or intern, but after they returned, most of them were often transferred to do other work, which makes it difficult to train cadres. It is recommended that after a certain period of time, the Academy of Sciences, universities, and relevant industrial ministries can cooperate to hold longer-term (for example, one year) teleautomatics training courses to train a group of more advanced telecontrol technology talents.
    The second is the problem of books and equipment. Very little research data on telecontrol technology has been published abroad, and even the very little that is available may not be available to us, which greatly hinders the development of telecontrol technology in China. A large part of the materials needed in teleautomatics cannot be manufactured domestically. There are many new remote measurement or control requirements that are relatively easy to solve technically, but there is a lack of special materials. The state will vigorously develop the radio industry in the Second Five-Year Plan. We hope that the radio industry will also pay special attention to the research and production of these many special material components, because this is indispensable not only for telecontrol technology, but also for automatic technology, computing technology, and so on.
    Research on teleautomatics will be carried out in many institutions. Since there are already very few talents in this field in China, how to divide labor and cooperate and make good use of strength will be an important issue. Although there are some provisions in the national twelve-year science plan, how to proceed specifically requires joint discussion by all relevant parties. We feel that academic conferences on teleautomatics can be organized regularly to exchange experiences, discuss academic issues, and study how to carry out work and coordinate forces; contact with foreign scientists should be especially strengthened to seek their help.

    飞速发展中的远距离自动学
　　王传善
    人们运用新的技术，不但可以使机器按着预定的意图自动进行各种复杂的工作，以代替人类的体力劳动和部分脑力劳动，而且也可以运用新的技术，在千里以外对这些机器的工作情况了若指掌，并且指挥裕如。这里说的新的技术，前一种叫做自动学，或者叫做自动控制；后一种叫做远距离自动学，简称“远动学”。
    远动学的逐渐形成并且获得比较广泛的应用是在本世纪三十年代。通常把远动技术分为远距离控制、远距离讯号、远距离测量和远距离调整。这里所说“远距离”是指从几公里到几千公里以上的距离，这时人们不能再采用一般的近地测量、控制等方法，需要采用特殊的技术措施，要把讯号或命令经过适当的变换，由通讯道传送到另一端，然后再转换过来。命令或讯号的产生可以是人工的，也可以是完全自动的。采用了这样的技术，将使技术工程人员的控制、监视范围扩大到千里以外，使巨大的企业部门连为一个整体，不仅可以实行集中调度控制，而且可以实现整个企业的自动化，大大提高劳动生产率。
    电力系统是应用远动技术最早并且最广泛的。近代的电力系统是由大量的巨型发电站、高压输电网和无数变电站组成的，分布在极大的面积上，将几百万瓩的电力供给各个工业部门，要求极高的可靠度和工作效率，只有借远动技术才能够得到最合理和最安全的运转。约在二十年以前，远距离测量和控制开始在电力系统中应用。现在许多国家的大电力系统的主要电站、干线等，都安装使用了远动设备，出现了不少完全无人的、实行远距离控制的水电站和变电所。这些无人水电站内发电机的起动、停车，断路器的操作，功率的分配等，都是由相隔很远的调度所或其他电站来管理的。所有水电站上一切需要知道的消息，如机件工作情况、水位等等，都由远距离讯号和远距离测量的方法取得。在电力系统中进行远距离控制或测量的距离，通常达到几百公里，个别有在千里以上的。远动技术的使用范围，包括了远距离测量功率、电压、频率、水位等等，远距离传送故障讯号和位置讯号，远距离操作断路器、闸门、改换变压器、改换运行方式以及调整自动装置的作用等等。苏联是在电力系统中应用远动技术最广泛的国家，不仅在各主要的发电站和输电线，就是在较低电压的配电线路，也开始应用远动技术；根据多年以来应用的结果证明，采用远动技术的确能使电力系统大大提高效率，并且也能及时消灭故障，保证安全供电。
    铁路运输部门也是采用远动技术很早、很广的，约在1935年，莫斯科到卡山斯基的铁路就实现了在六十多公里以外的集中控制。现在，除了远距离控制铁路号志和转辙器以外，远动技术被应用在控制电气铁路和地下铁道的牵引变电站。在这许多变电站中有些也是完全不需要值班人员的。经验证明，远距离集中控制铁路号志，转辙器、变电站等，可以大大节省工作人员，增加行车速度和安全度，因而提高铁路的运输效能。在石油工业、煤气工业等部门采用远动技术也有着特殊意义。现代的石油输油管、煤气管等长达几百公里以上，必须有远距离监视、控制的设备，以便对整个系统集中操纵。这些输油管、煤气管的沿途有很多的虹吸管站，都需要进行远距离控制，需要远距离测量流量、压力、流速、液面等，需要远距离调整石油或煤气的压力、流量等。远动技术在冶金、采矿、化工等大企业中的应用也在日益增加，开始是集中控制热电供应系统，现在则要求对个别部门或机件实行远距离监视和控制。在航行运河、灌溉系统等，也愈来愈要求远动技术的帮助。以莫斯科运河为例，由于使用远动装置，完全消灭了人为故障，并且将抽水站的启动时间缩短到原来的十分之一。在农村电气化方面，在大城市的公用事业方面，都开始要求掌握远动技术。远动技术不仅在规模宏大、各组成部分距离很远和散布很广的生产部门要应用，在其他一些特殊的情况，当需要控制或监视某些危险目标的时候或人类所不能达到的地方，也非使用不可。现在已经有很多地方在利用远距离测量技术进行高空和深山的气象研究，应用远距离控制进行超高压和原子能的试验；对于新型的飞机进行无人飞行试验等等。根据最近的报道，科学家们还正在研究人造卫星所必需的远动技术问题。
    远动技术在军事方面也是很重要的。早在第二次世界大战期间，德国的V—2飞弹就应用了简单的远距离控制原理，以校准它的飞行路线和距离；美国在防御日本潜水艇袭击其西海岸的措施中也采用了远动技术。现在，远动技术被使用在控制，试验导弹和核子武器等方面。
    到现在为止，在各个方面所应用的远动技术还大半是需要人来控制的。在国外，科学家们正在研究试验真正的远距离自动控制。有一些是比较简单的，如远距离自动闭锁等，早已经在运用；有一些则很复杂，需要电子计算机的帮助。在电力系统内实行远距离自动调度，可以不要调度人员而使整个系统自动按照最经济的方式运转，并且保证高度的安全可靠性。也可以用远动技术把雷达、电子计算机和导弹联结起来，使后者能自动地追踪目标。像这样完全的远距离自动控制，虽然还在试验阶段，但是最后成功是可以预期的。可以相信，当这样的技术成熟以后，在工业建设和国防方面将发挥巨大的作用。
    在有些国家（例如美国）还没有把远动学作为一个独立的学科看待，仅作为综合的技术应用；但在苏联却把远动学看作是一个完全独立的科学部门。科学家们已经提出了要在自动控制原理、信息论和继电线路原理的基础上，逐步建立起远距离自动学的普遍理论。这样的理论将能够解决关于远动系统的分析和综合，远动讯号的变换、传送和选择，准确度、可靠度和动作速度以及远动系统、自动控制系统和电子计算机结合等一系列重大的基本的理论问题。这样的理论，将可以使远动技术更为迅速地向前推进。
    过去，远动学在中国是缺门，没有人研究过它，远动技术也没有被使用过。1953年底，中国科学院机械电机研究所成立远动学研究组，开始了这方面的研究工作。1954、1955两年内，重点进行远距离测量的研究，研究试验了脉冲频率制的远距离测量系统。试验结果，准确度达到了国外的一般要求，并且设计试验了同时传送六路远测讯号的电力线载波设备，试验室内制造的模型已经在东北电力系统的某发电厂和变电站安装使用；另外又研究成功了一种电子型的远距离测量相加器。1956年除了继续远距离测量的研究工作以外，并且开始了远距离控制的研究，到目前为止，已经研究设计成功了一种小容量的讯号系统，并且经北京市电业局制成了模型，安装在北京某变电站使用。这是我国的第一个远距离控制的变电站，经使用一个阶段后，就可以把值班人员撤消，改为完全无人的远距离控制变电所。此外，在试验室中已经试验成功了一种磁性的静止式远距离测量功率变换器，也将在电力系统中安装试用。目前还在进行一种完全新型的采取时间划分方法的远距离测量系统的研究，并且也开始进行了若干有关远动学的基本理论研究工作。除了科学院以外，电力工业部技术改进局在今年也开始了远距离测量的研究试验工作，在频率制远距离测量和整流式远距测量设备方法已经获得了成绩，试制的仿苏联的频率制远测设备也已经安装使用，有良好的性能。在党和政府提出十二年内赶上或接近世界先进科学技术水平的指示下，远动学在我国的发展将是异常迅速的。中共中央在发展第二个五年计划的建议中，也明确提出要在我国建立这种新技术的基础。中国科学院已经成立关于自动学和远动学方面的研究所，将大力开展这方面研究工作。各产业部门也正积极准备建立研究机构，进行有关远动技术的研究。有些高等学校也准备开设有关这方面的课程。远动技术将逐步在各个国民经济部门得到应用。无人的水电站、远距离控制的电气铁道，以及远距离调度控制的车间、矿场、输油管、灌溉系统等等，将陆续出现。
    然而要实现这样美丽的发展远景还需要先创造一些条件。首先是缺乏研究和技术干部的问题。目前我国这方面的研究工作人员很少，力量很薄弱，新的力量的补充来源也有一定困难。希望高等学校能及早考虑建立自动学和远动学专业，多开设远动学的课程，并且适当地考虑其他专业部分高年级学生补充远动学知识，以尽早满足外界的要求。关于师资的问题，除了在本校培养解决以外，可以聘请苏联专家指导，也可以同科学院合作，请研究人员开设若干专门课程。各企业部门也可以自己培养或委托科学院培养。过去机械电机研究所曾经接受了不少高等学校和产业部门的人员学习或实习，但是他们回去以后，多数人往往又被调做其他工作，这样是很难培养干部的。建议在一定时期以后，科学院、高等学校和有关各工业部，可以合作举办较长期的（例如一年）远动学训练班，培养一批比较高级的远动技术人才。
    其次是图书设备问题。在国外关于远动技术的研究资料发表出来的很少，就是这很少的一些我们也不一定能得到，这就大大阻碍我国远动技术的发展，希望有关方面能帮助设法解决。在远动学中所需要的材料，有很大一部分国内都不能制造。有很多新的远距离测量或控制等要求，在技术上是比较容易解决的，但是缺乏特殊材料。国家将在第二个五年计划内大力发展无线电工业。我们希望无线电工业中也特别注意这许多特殊材料元件的研究和生产，因为这不单是对于远动技术，就是对于自动技术、计算技术等等也是不可缺少的。
    远动学的研究将在很多机构开展起来。由于我国这方面人才本来就很少，如何分工合作，很好地发挥力量将是一个重要问题。这在国家十二年科学规划中虽有了一些规定，但具体如何进行还需要各有关方面共同讨论。我们觉得可以定期地组织远动学的学术会议，互相交流经验，讨论学术问题，并且研究如何开展工作配合力量；对于外国科学家的联系要特别加强，争取他们的帮助。
