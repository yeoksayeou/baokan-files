Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd dispatch: According to a TASS dispatch from Budapest: The Hungarian newspaper "People's Will" published on the 1st a conversation between the Hungarian Minister of Armed Forces, Münnich, and a staff member of the newspaper.

Münnich talked about the situation of those Hungarians who had fled to the West. He said that some of them fled because they had participated in the armed rebellion. Others fled because they were full of pessimism and disappointment. Many young people left the country simply out of curiosity. Many people fled to the West because they took rumors as truth and believed the provocative broadcasts of Western radio stations, which had told them many sweet words.

More and more of those who fled to the West are now returning to Hungary. Because they encounter the obvious fact there: they are placed in poorly equipped shelters, and they suffer many hardships. All sorts of suspicious secret agents recruit them to work in mines, to join the Foreign Legion, etc.; these suspicious people also make insulting suggestions to women. Faced with such prospects, of course, many fugitives recall their comfortable homes in Budapest and hope to return to their homeland.

Münnich then said that those who had regretted leaving their homeland rashly were pleased to learn that the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government had promulgated a decree granting amnesty to those who returned home before March of next year, and were pleased to know that Hungarian diplomatic missions and border defense agencies were providing various assistance to those returning home. Now, it is not just single batches of fugitives returning home; representatives from some refugee camps are also coming to the Hungarian border, and all the exiles in these refugee camps have raised the issue of returning home. Each of these refugee camps houses several thousand people.

Finally, Münnich said that the Hungarian government agencies receive those who return home. Those returning from abroad are first provided with food, and then sent to their places of residence from well-equipped distribution stations. Those who have returned to their homeland are already convinced that those who return home under the amnesty decree have not encountered any trouble, no lawsuits have been filed against them, and they can immediately return to their homes.

Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd dispatch: According to a TASS dispatch from Vienna on the 1st: Recently, Hungarian citizens living in refugee camps in Austria have become increasingly determined to return to their homeland. However, some people, regardless of the wishes of the refugees, are doing their best to prevent them from returning to Hungary. The Austrian authorities have repeatedly raised the issue with Western governments, asking what emergency measures they are prepared to take to remove Hungarian citizens from Austrian territory. State Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Kreisky and Gruberhofer have requested the governments of Western European countries to run trains directly to the Austro-Hungarian border in order to quickly transport Hungarian citizens to the West. The work of transferring Hungarian refugees to distant countries—such as South America, Canada, and Australia—has recently begun.

### 匈牙利武装部队部长明尼赫说　从奥境回国的匈牙利人日增  西方国家已开始劫运匈难民的罪恶活动

    匈牙利武装部队部长明尼赫说
　　从奥境回国的匈牙利人日增
    西方国家已开始劫运匈难民的罪恶活动
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利“人民意志报”1日刊载了匈牙利武装部队部长明尼赫对这个报纸工作人员的谈话。
    明尼赫谈到了逃往西方的那些匈牙利人的情况。他说，他们当中有一部分人所以逃跑，是因为参加了武装暴动。其他一些人所以逃跑，是因为他们充满悲观失望情绪。许多青年人离开国家只是为了猎奇。许多人逃到西方是因为把谣言当作了真话，相信了西方电台挑拨性的广播，西方电台曾经对他们讲过许多甜言蜜语。
    逃往西方去的人现在越来越多地回到匈牙利。因为他们在那里遇到这样一个明显的事实：他们被安置在设备很坏的收容所，他们受到许多困苦。形形色色的行迹可疑的特务招募他们去矿井工作，去参加外籍军团等等；这些可疑的人还向妇女提出侮辱性的建议。在这样的前途下，当然许多逃亡者就回忆起自己留在布达佩斯的舒适住宅，希望返回祖国。
    明尼赫接着说，那些已经后悔轻率地离开了祖国的人高兴地知道匈牙利工农革命政府颁布了在明年3月以前回国的人可以得到特赦的法令，高兴地知道匈牙利外交机构和边防机关给予回国者的各种支援。现在已经不单是单批的逃亡者回国，一些收容所的代表也来到匈牙利边境，这些收容所的全体流亡者都提出了回国的问题。这些收容所各住有几千人。
    最后，明尼赫说，匈牙利政府机关接待回国的人。从国外回来的人首先得到伙食供应，而后从设备很好的分配站送到居住地点。已经回到祖国的人已经确信，根据特赦令回国的人并没有遭到任何麻烦，没有向他们提出任何诉讼，他们可以立即回到自己家中去。
    据新华社2日讯　据塔斯社维也纳1日讯：近来，住在奥地利的难民营里的匈牙利公民越来越坚决地要求回祖国。但有人不顾难民的意愿，竭力阻挠他们回匈牙利。奥地利当局不只一次地向西方国家政府提出问题，问它们准备采取什么紧急措施，从奥地利境内撤走匈牙利公民。外交部国务秘书克赖斯基和格鲁布霍弗尔要求西欧国家政府把火车直接开往奥匈边境，以便迅速把匈牙利公民运往西方。把匈牙利难民撤往遥远的国家——如南美、加拿大和澳大利亚的工作最近已经开始了。
