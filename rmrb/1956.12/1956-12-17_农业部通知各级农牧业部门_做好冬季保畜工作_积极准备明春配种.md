The Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice requiring agricultural (pastoral) departments in all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities to do a good job in winter animal protection and actively prepare for spring mating.

The notice pointed out: According to recent reports from various regions, the phenomenon of weak draft animals has occurred again in many areas, seriously threatening the spring mating and breeding work and spring plowing production. To this end, agricultural (pastoral) departments in all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities must allocate a certain amount of manpower to supervise the county-level organization of animal husbandry and veterinary stations, and agricultural technology extension stations to inspect the winter animal protection work, and help agricultural cooperatives do the following tasks:

First, conduct a thorough assessment of the amount of feed needed for draft animals to overwinter and pass the spring, and the amount of feed currently in reserve. If it is insufficient, we must tap the potential as soon as possible and find ways to solve it. Hilly and mountainous areas should continue to collect yellow grass; plain areas must widely collect various straws as feed; in areas that are not accustomed to using coarse and hard straws, we must actively promote methods such as alkalization, crushing, and soaking to expand the source of feed. Disaster-stricken areas should especially seize this work. Currently, some members of cooperatives in disaster areas still have feed in their hands. If the cooperative is unable to purchase it, it should be allocated in a timely manner, or animal protection loans should be adjusted from the total loan amount to help solve the problem. If conditions permit, agricultural cooperatives can also be organized to purchase and allocate grass from nearby areas with surplus grass.

Second, the important key for agricultural cooperatives to raise draft animals well lies in establishing and improving the feeding management and epidemic prevention system for draft animals. Cooperatives that already have systems should conduct in-depth inspections, strengthen and consolidate effective systems, and revise systems that are not practical. Cooperatives that do not yet have a system must establish one as soon as possible. In order to strengthen the leadership of agricultural cooperatives in animal husbandry, agricultural cooperatives should designate a deputy director to be responsible for animal husbandry work.

Third, some agricultural cooperatives are currently raising some old and disabled livestock. Agricultural departments should cooperate with supply and marketing cooperatives and food companies to, under the unified leadership of the local party and government, clear out and eliminate old and disabled draft animals that are indeed unable to cultivate; however, weak draft animals should not be eliminated casually, but agricultural cooperatives should be educated to reduce labor, supplement grass and add feed to gradually restore them to health. Pregnant female animals should be given extra care to prevent miscarriage.

Fourth, this year the livestock in some pastoral areas are not as fat as last year. The competent animal husbandry departments must further understand the yellow grass reserves and fodder storage in winter pastures. Areas lacking grass must be helped to survey pastures nearby and conduct consultations for allocation. In addition, fire prevention organizations should be strengthened, and fire prevention publicity and education should be carried out to prevent grassland fires.

Fifth, many areas did not seize the opportunity for draft animal mating this year, which is a great loss. In order to do a good job in mating next year, agricultural cooperatives in all regions must investigate the number of breeding female animals and the number of breeding male animals in the entire cooperative this winter, and formulate a mating and breeding plan for next year. State-owned breeding stations must give full play to the breeding capacity of breeding male animals to help mate the female animals in nearby agricultural cooperatives. In some areas where breeding animals are insufficient, agricultural departments should cooperate with supply and marketing departments to organize agricultural cooperatives to purchase them from other places. Provinces with more breeding male animals should vigorously support the aforementioned areas.

### 农业部通知各级农牧业部门  做好冬季保畜工作　积极准备明春配种

    农业部通知各级农牧业部门
    做好冬季保畜工作　积极准备明春配种
    本报讯　农业部发出通知，要求各省、区、市农（牧）业部门作好冬季保畜工作和积极准备明春配种工作。
    通知指出：近据各地报告，不少地区又发生耕畜瘦弱现象，严重地威胁着明春的配种繁殖工作和春耕生产。为此，各省、区、市农（牧）业部门必须抽调一定人力，督促各县组织畜牧兽医工作站、农业技术推广站干部，对冬季保畜工作进行检查，帮助农业社做好以下几项工作：
    一、对耕畜越冬渡春所需饲草数量和目前饲草储备数量进行摸底，如果不足，必须及早挖掘潜力，设法解决。丘陵、山区应该继续收集黄草；平原地区必须广泛收集各种秸秆作饲草；在不习惯利用粗硬秸秆的地方，必须积极推广碱化、碾碎、泡软等方法，扩大饲草来源。受灾地区，尤应抓紧这一工作。目前，灾区有些社的社员，手中尚存有饲草的，如社无力购买时，应及时下拨，或从总的贷款额中调剂保畜贷款帮助解决。如有条件，还可以组织农业社到附近有余草的地区购草调剂。
    二、农业社养好耕畜的重要关键，在于建立和健全耕畜饲养管理和防疫制度。凡已有制度的社，应该深入检查，对行之有效的制度，要加强巩固，对不切合实际的制度，必须修正。还没有制度的社，更须及早建立起来。为了加强农业社对畜牧工作的领导，农业社应该指定副主任负责畜牧工作。
    三、现在有些农业社养着一些老残牲畜，农业部门应该协同供销合作社、食品公司，在地方党政统一领导下，对确实没有耕作能力的老残耕畜进行清理淘汰；但对瘦弱耕畜不能随便淘汰，而应该教育农业社减轻劳役、补草加料，使它们逐步恢复健壮。对怀胎母畜，要加强护理，防止流产。
    四、今年有些牧区的畜膘不及去年，畜牧主管部门必须进一步了解冬季牧场的黄草存留情况及储草情况。缺草地区，须帮助牧民就近勘察牧场，并进行协商调剂。此外，并要加强防火组织，开展防火宣传教育，防止草原失火。
    五、今年很多地区未抓紧耕畜配种，这是一个很大的损失。为了作好明年配种工作，各地农业社必须在今冬查清全社可繁殖的母畜头数、种公畜头数，订出明年配种繁殖计划。公营配种站更须充分发挥种公畜的配种能力，帮助附近农业社的母畜配种。有些地区种畜不足，农业部门应该协同供销合作部门组织农业社去外地采购，种公畜较多的省应该大力支援上述地区。
