Resolutions on the work of completing the Sixth Five-Year Plan, on determining the control figures for 1956-1960, and on the guidelines for the 1957 national economic plan.
(Adopted based on the reports by Comrades Baibakov and Saburov)

The resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) have been unanimously endorsed by the entire Soviet people. These resolutions have sparked a vigorous upsurge in the creative initiative and enthusiasm of millions of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals in our country.

The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out that, due to the unwavering implementation of the Leninist policy and the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, new and significant achievements were made in 1956 in the development of socialist industry, especially heavy industry. The annual plan for industrial production in 1956 will be overfulfilled. The output of industrial products will increase by approximately 11% compared to 1955, with the production of means of production increasing by more than 11% and the production of consumer goods increasing by more than 9%. Production targets for many important types of industrial products will be overfulfilled. Achievements have also been made in the technological advancement of industry – the adoption of the latest scientific and technological achievements and advanced experiences in production has accelerated. Our industry's power base has been greatly strengthened by the commissioning of new capacities at large hydroelectric and thermal power plants.

The achievements of socialist industry in the first year of the Sixth Five-Year Plan mark a new step forward on the road to building the material and technical foundation of communism. The Soviet state has become stronger, its economic and defense capabilities have increased, and the material well-being of the people has also improved.

On the basis of prioritized development of heavy industry, other sectors of the national economy, including agriculture, are developing effectively. Machine tractor stations and state farms are equipped with thousands of tractors, combine harvesters, automobiles, and other machines. This has enabled us to reclaim 35.5 million hectares of virgin land in a short period, resulting in a significant increase in agricultural production in 1956 and an increase in state procurement and acquisition – grain increased by more than one billion poods compared to 1955, potatoes increased by 2.7 million tons, and dairy products increased by 3.8 million tons. The procurement of cotton, wool, and other agricultural products has also increased. The production of consumer goods has increased significantly. In 1956, light industry supplied the residents with products exceeding the plan by 3 billion rubles, and the food industry exceeded the plan by 4 billion rubles.

The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out that, in addition to huge investments aimed at high-speed development of heavy industry and agriculture, major measures were also taken in 1956 to realize the program formulated by the 20th Congress of the CPSU regarding the further improvement of the material welfare and cultural level of the people: increased welfare benefits for working people, abolition of tuition fees in secondary schools and higher education institutions, extension of pregnancy and maternity leave, shortening of the workday on the day before holidays and days off, and the beginning of the transition to a shortened workday system in the coal industry. Procurement and acquisition prices for agricultural products have been raised. A decision was made to raise the wages of low-wage workers from January 1, 1957. These measures alone will allow the urban and rural working people to obtain more than 35 billion rubles in additional benefits annually.

The entire historical experience of the Soviet state, as well as the experience of other socialist countries in the post-war era, irrefutably and convincingly proves that the socialist economic system is vastly superior to the capitalist system. It is precisely because these advantages are becoming increasingly evident, and that in the peaceful economic competition between the socialist and capitalist systems, victory will certainly belong to the socialist system, that the reactionary forces of the capitalist world are doing everything possible to slander the socialist economic system and distort its essence. These attempts are bound to fail because practice and the life experience of the people show that the socialist economic system is superior.

The socialist economy is a planned economy, which enables the rapid and planned development of all the productive forces of the country. Socialist production is for the benefit of the whole people, and it opens up infinitely broad opportunities for the development of creative initiative for the millions of workers, peasants, and intellectuals.

At present, the task of the Party lies in better and more fully utilizing the extremely great and historically significant advantages of the socialist system and the socialist economic system for the benefit of the people and for the construction of communism. In order to solve this task, in addition to a strong production technology base, we have a large number of skilled working cadres and skilled management production organs. Now, our cadres are able to expertly solve all kinds of the most complex production economic problems and scientific and technical problems, and achieve excellent results in industry, transportation, construction and agriculture with the least consumption of labor, funds and materials.

At the same time, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU pointed out that although the amount of coal mining, metal, cement, and logging has increased compared to 1955, the 1956 production plan for these products was not completed. The plan for putting production equipment into operation in the above-mentioned departments and in some other national economic departments was also not completed. The housing construction plan was not fully completed.

This failure to complete the plan is due, on the one hand, to serious shortcomings in the national economic plan, and on the other hand, to the unsatisfactory leadership of enterprises and construction projects by some departments.

When formulating the national economic plan, the State Planning Commission, the State Economic Commission, and various ministries did not adequately consider the realistic possibility of guaranteeing the planned tasks with materials and funds. They did not pay attention to stockpiling sufficient raw materials, fuel, and materials. The scale of construction was too large, resulting in excessive tension in the implementation of the plan. There were also some omissions and errors in the plan. This situation disrupted the rhythm of enterprise work, produced phenomena of shock work and stagnation, and in the construction sector, it dispersed funds to many new construction projects, prolonged construction periods, increased costs, and failed to complete projects on schedule. This irrational use of state funds resulted in the freezing of funds, reduced the effectiveness of investment, disrupted the proportionate development of various economic sectors, and ultimately caused significant losses to the national economy.

In order to rapidly eliminate the above-mentioned shortcomings and to correctly utilize all resources and potential to ensure the further planned development of the national economy, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU decided:

I. To submit the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for review and approval in the first half of 1957.

When completing the compilation of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the main tasks of the Five-Year Plan stipulated by the 20th Congress of the CPSU should be used as the basis, that is: on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, constantly improving technology and increasing labor productivity, ensuring the further vigorous development of all sectors of the national economy, rapidly developing agricultural production, and on this basis, greatly improving the material well-being and cultural level of the Soviet people, and advancing a major step in completing the main economic task of the Soviet Union – that is, in the shortest historical period, catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product production.

II. In order to eliminate the phenomenon of excessive tension that has appeared in the plans of individual industrial departments, and in order to implement the task of production and investing in accordance with material resources, it is considered necessary to further clarify certain preliminary tasks stipulated in the Five-Year Plan instructions and the draft plan for 1957.

When further clarifying the tasks, follow the following guidelines:

(1) Ensure the most rational and effective use of material and financial resources to develop the national economy. To this end, first of all, reduce the amount of investment, formulate a more precise list of construction projects, reduce construction projects, especially reduce newly built construction projects; do not disperse funds for many construction projects, but concentrate material and financial resources on the most important construction projects and projects that have already started, in order to improve the material guarantees for them;

Modify the planned tasks of certain industrial departments that cannot be fully guaranteed by material resources;

Stipulate the establishment of necessary material reserves in industry in order to create normal conditions for the uninterrupted and rhythmic work of enterprises;

(2) Try to allocate more funds for housing construction. It is necessary to resolutely eliminate all kinds of waste in housing construction that increases costs and reduces the speed of construction development, to better use local building materials, and to actively support the initiative shown by the masses of workers in order to accelerate housing construction.

III. Reprimand individual economic leaders for trying to use the shortcomings in planning work to cover up their poor leadership of enterprises and projects, and condemn their ideas of wanting to lower the plan for no reason. The plan should be feasible, but it should not be lowered without reason. The plan should be based on technical and economic conditions, and consider the use of advanced experience and internal production potential, and should mobilize the working people to strive to continuously improve production.

IV. The starting point for determining production tasks is that it is necessary to improve the enthusiasm of the working people when formulating plans and striving for the victorious completion and over-fulfillment of plans. To this end, it is necessary to widely call for serious discussions on the long-term plans of enterprises and collective farms at various meetings, and to regularly check the implementation of these plans.

In the future, it is still necessary to improve the role of the member republics in economic construction, to stimulate and support their initiative to find and better utilize local resources and potential to increase the output of industrial products and daily necessities. This requires improving the sense of responsibility of the leading organs at all levels of the member republics for the completion of the national plan, and strengthening their organizational role in mobilizing the masses to solve the various tasks put forward by the Party and the government.

V. Order all economic leaders, Soviet, Party and trade union organizations to resolutely eliminate shortcomings in economic leadership work, take effective measures to prevent the dispersion of material resources, strive to fully tap the internal potential of enterprises, improve the use of existing equipment, ensure the completion of production and construction plans, improve labor productivity, reduce product costs and improve product quality on the basis of technological progress, and rapidly promote new technologies, improve labor organization, and improve production procedures. It is necessary to fight against conservatism and bureaucracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and fully support the creative initiative and enthusiasm of the working people.

The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU reminds the Party, Soviet, economic, trade union and Communist Youth League organizations and all our staff members that the tasks put forward in this resolution are determined by the development process of the country, and the unconditional implementation of these resolutions is the vital need of the Soviet state. What is referred to here is: to make new improvements in productivity, increase social wealth, thereby further strengthening our country's economic strength and strengthening defense capabilities, and further improve the material well-being of the Soviet people.

In the capitalist world, competition between countries and between monopoly capital groups is becoming increasingly fierce and expanding. In pursuit of maximum profits, monopoly capital is increasingly intensifying the exploitation of the working class, enslaving peasants, and launching attacks on the living standards of the working masses. Colonial countries are seeking new areas for investment through imperialist expansion, and are trying to expand the scope of capitalist exploitation, primarily by enslaving economically underdeveloped countries. However, this imperialist expansion is bound to cause the growth of resistance from the people of these countries and the vigorous upsurge of national liberation movements. All this inevitably leads to the further militarization of the capitalist economy, leading to the expansion of armaments, the further sharpening and deepening of internal contradictions in the capitalist system, and clearly shows that this system is unstable and is destined to be eliminated in history.

The Soviet socialist system does not have all these ills and extremely deep contradictions of the capitalist mode of production.

The Soviet Union is fighting to strengthen the unbreakable unity and develop the fraternal cooperation of socialist countries. It is implementing a policy of peace and friendship with all peace-loving people. It is advancing confidently along the Leninist road. The Soviet people are using all their strength and creative energy to realize the construction plan formulated by the Communist Party. They are working in a stable environment. They know that the Soviet state is unswervingly defending the interests of the people and consistently defending the cause of world peace.

The Soviet people firmly follow the teachings of the great Lenin, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, solved a series of tasks of building and developing a strong socialist industry and a socialist agriculture. Now, we have all the necessary conditions to transition to a new and higher stage of economic development that is compatible with the current stage of communist construction.

The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes that the working class, collective farmers, and Soviet intellectuals will launch socialist competition more broadly, strive to complete and over-fulfill production plans, and do everything possible to extremely fully utilize the production potential and reserves of each industrial enterprise, each construction site, all collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms, in order to victoriously realize the historical resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on this basis.

Resolution on Improving the Leadership of the Soviet National Economy
(Adopted based on the report by Comrade Bulganin)

The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out that a series of important measures are currently being implemented in accordance with the instructions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to improve national planning work, eliminate excessive centralization in economic management, improve the role of member republics in economic construction, and further expand the powers of various Soviet ministries, economic management agencies, and enterprises, and streamline administrative management organs. The measures implemented by the Party and the government fully conform to Lenin's principles of socialist management, the foundation of which is democratic centralism in the leadership of economic construction. Lenin pointed out as early as the first few months after the establishment of the Soviet regime: "Our current task is to implement democratic centralism in the economic field..."

Democratic centralism in national economic leadership stems from the essence of socialist large-scale production, from the nature of the socialist economy – a planned economy – and also from the essence of the Soviet system, which mobilizes millions of working people to engage in conscious historical creation and participate in the management of national and economic construction. Democratic centralism requires greatly improving planning work and consolidating the planned foundation in the entire economic activity. At the same time, democratic centralism also means paying extreme attention to and fully considering local experience and local conditions, actively supporting and encouraging the creative initiative of local Party, Soviet, economic, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations, as well as millions of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals.

The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU believes it is necessary to point out that serious shortcomings exist in national planning work, especially in the current plan. The State Planning Commission and the State Economic Commission, as well as various ministries, have not studied the situation of various production departments sufficiently, their connection with member republics and autonomous republics, border regions and states, and with enterprises and scientific institutions is not close enough, they have committed serious omissions and errors in the compilation of production, basic construction, and material technology supply plans, and they have not well taken on the task of checking the implementation of national plans.

In view of the Party's primary task of continuing to do everything possible to improve the leadership of the national economy in accordance with the instructions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Central Committee Plenary Session decided:

I. It is necessary to take measures to fundamentally improve the annual planning work of the Soviet State Economic Commission, and to give it the function of flexibly solving problems that arise at any time in the completion of national plans, and to order it to ensure the supply of material resources necessary to complete the plans.

The State Economic Commission and various ministries should ensure the most rational and effective use of production funds, and the use of labor, raw materials and monetary resources. The most important task of the State Economic Commission and all our economic institutions is to systematically promote advanced scientific and technological achievements, the valuable experience of innovators, and the suggestions of rationalization proposers and inventors into production. Serious attention should be paid to the issues of enterprise specialization and collaboration, to the links between various production departments, and to the mutual coordination of economic activities in various economic regions. The implementation of all these measures will be able to ensure the high-speed socialist expanded reproduction, and continuously improve labor productivity – the main conditions for increasing output, improving quality, reducing product costs, and improving people's material well-being.

II. The Plenary Session believes that expanding the authority of the member republics is of particular significance for improving the leadership of the national economy. This can implement Lenin's national policy in economic construction and cultural construction, fully consider the national characteristics and local resources of each republic, and promote the further strengthening of the economy of each member republic and the consolidation of friendship between the various nationalities of the Soviet Union.

In order to eliminate excessive centralization in economic leadership, the Plenary Session believes it is necessary to:

Take measures to greatly expand the scope of economic construction and cultural construction issues that the Council of Ministers of the member republics should resolve that are related to the completion of the national plans of the entire alliance and the member republics, including issues such as basic construction, material technology supply, labor productivity, costs, product sales, and appropriations;

Ensure the further expansion of the powers of ministries, ministry-affiliated general bureaus, labor people's representative Soviets, and economic enterprises;

Eliminate redundant and overlapping units, that is, streamline administrative management organs;

Make the central economic management organs and scientific research organs directly closer to the distribution areas of enterprises in the corresponding national economic departments;

Ensure the mutual coordination and coordination of economic activities within various economic regions and large industrial centers.

III. In view of the serious shortcomings in the work of the departments and competent authorities responsible for the material-technical supply of enterprises, it is considered necessary to take organizational measures to thoroughly improve this work, in order to ensure a more rational use of material resources and not allow them to be piled up in countless warehouses and storage yards.

IV. The Party and the government and the major tasks of the Sixth Five-Year Plan period that are proposed to strive for technological progress and large-scale development of socialist production place high demands on economic work cadres and on all production leaders and organizers. They should be proficient in their business, be familiar with modern scientific and technological achievements, study the technology and economy of enterprises, regularly understand their needs, and lead production specifically and purposefully. All this requires Soviet economic workers to strictly demand themselves and their subordinates, to listen carefully to the voices of the masses, to actively support their initiatives, to stubbornly master technical knowledge, expand economic vision, and improve methods of managing production.

V. In view of the extremely important role that trade unions, which unite almost all employees, should play in improving economic leadership, it is necessary to:

Improve the role of trade unions in formulating and implementing enterprise production and financial plans, and in solving issues related to labor quotas and organization, wages, and improving enterprise safety technology, and especially to improve the role of trade unions in solving issues related to housing construction and improving the material living conditions of workers and staff;

Regularly carry out socialist competition, regarding it as a powerful means of struggling to complete and over-fulfill economic plans and continuously develop the socialist economy;

Regularly hold meetings of workers and staff, production meetings, technical meetings, economic activists meetings, meetings of advanced producers, rationalization proposers and inventors, and widely carry out the work of various scientific and technological groups.

The activities of Soviet trade unions should be raised to a considerable level, so that trade unions completely live up to their lofty mission, making trade unions, as Lenin taught, become "schools of administration, schools of management, schools of communism."

VI. Order the Communist Party Central Committees of the member republics, the border region committees and state committees of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to conscientiously improve the work of enterprises and economic organs, pay special attention to the selection, promotion and rational distribution of cadres, check the implementation of the Party and government resolutions, and pay attention to maintaining strict discipline in all links of the economic management organs.

The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union calls on all Party organizations and all Communist Party members to resolutely realize the tasks stipulated by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, that is, to further develop the Soviet socialist economy, improve organizational work, improve the methods of leading economic construction in accordance with Lenin's principles of socialist management, and strive to give full play to the creative initiative and enthusiasm of the masses of working people.

### 苏共中央全会的两项决议

    苏共中央全会的两项决议
    关于完成编制第六个五年计划的工作以及关于确定1956—1960年的控制数字和1957年国民经济计划方针的决议
    （根据巴伊巴科夫同志和萨布罗夫同志的报告通过）
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议得到了全体苏联人民一致的赞同，这个决议引起了我国千百万工人、集体农民和知识分子的创造性主动精神和积极性的蓬勃高涨。
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议指出，由于坚定不移地执行了列宁主义的政策和实现了苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议，1956年在社会主义工业、首先是重工业发展方面取得了新的巨大成就。1956年工业品生产的整个年度计划将超额完成。工业品的产量将比1955年约增加11％，其中生产资料的生产将增加11％以上、消费品的生产将增加9％以上。许多重要种类的工业品的生产任务将超额完成。在工业的技术进步方面也获得了成就——在生产中采用科学、技术的最新成就和先进经验的速度加快了。由于大型水电站和大型火电站的新的能力投入生产，我们工业的动力基础大大地加强了。
    社会主义工业在第六个五年计划的第一年所获得的成就，表明了在建立共产主义物质技术基础的道路上向前跨了新的一步。苏维埃国家变得更加强大，它的经济和国防力量增强了，人民的物质福利也提高了。
    在优先发展重工业的基础上，包括农业在内的国民经济的其他部门正在有效地发展着。机器拖拉机站和国营农场中装备着成千上万的拖拉机、联合收割机、汽车和其他机器。这就使我们能够在短时期内开垦三千五百五十万公顷的生荒地，使农业生产在1956年就有相当大的高涨，使国家的征购和收购量增加——粮食比1955年增加十亿多普特，马铃薯增加二百七十万吨，奶类增加三百八十万吨。棉花、毛类和其他农产品的征购量也都增加了。消费品的生产量增加了很多。1956年轻工业供给居民的产品超过了计划三十亿卢布，食品工业的供应超过计划四十亿卢布。
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议指出，除了巨额投资以求高速度地发展重工业和农业以外，1956年还采取了重大措施来实现苏共第二十次代表大会所拟定的关于进一步提高人民的物质福利和文化水平的纲领：提高了劳动人民的优抚金额，取消了中等学校和高等学校的学费，延长了孕假和产假，缩短了节日前和休息日前一天的工作日，在煤炭工业部门开始向实行缩短工作日制度过渡。农产品的征购、收购价格提高了。通过了从1957年1月1日起提高低工资职工的工资的决定。仅仅上述措施就使城乡劳动人民每年可以获得三百五十亿卢布以上的额外利益。
    苏维埃国家的全部历史经验以及战后年代其他社会主义国家的经验无可争辩地和令人信服地证明，社会主义经济制度大大优越于资本主义制度。正是因为这些优越性越来越明显地显示出，在社会主义和资本主义两种制度和平经济竞赛中，胜利必定属于社会主义制度，所以资本主义世界的反动势力千方百计地诬蔑社会主义经济制度和歪曲它的实质。这些企图必然遭到失败，因为实践和人民的生活经验表明社会主义经济制度是优越的。
    社会主义经济是计划经济，它使得国家的一切生产力能够迅速地和有计划地发展；社会主义的生产是为了全民的利益，它给千百万工人、农民和知识分子群众开辟了发展创造性主动精神的无限广阔的余地。
    目前党的任务在于更好地、更充分地利用社会主义制度、社会主义经济制度的极其伟大的、具有世界历史意义的优越性去为人民造福，为共产主义建设造福。为了解决这个任务，我们除了强大的生产技术基础以外，还有大量熟练的工作干部和熟练的管理生产的机关。现在，我们的干部能够十分内行地解决各种最复杂的生产经济问题和科学技术问题，并且在劳动、资金和材料消耗最少的条件下，在工业、运输业、建筑业以及农业方面取得优异的成果。
    同时，苏共中央全会指出：虽然采煤量、金属、水泥、伐木量比1955年有了增长，但是这些产品的1956年生产计划没有完成。上述各部门以及若干其他国民经济部门生产设备投入生产的计划也没有完成。住宅建筑计划没有能够全部完成。
    这种完不成计划的情况，一方面是由于国民经济计划中的严重缺点，另一方面是由于有些部对企业和建筑工程的不能令人满意的领导所造成的。
    国家计划委员会、国家经济委员会以及各部在制定国民经济计划的时候，对于用物资和资金来保证计划任务的现实可能性考虑得不够，他们没有注意到要储备足够的原料、燃料和材料，建设的规模过于庞大，以致在执行计划的时候过度紧张；计划中也有一些疏忽和错误的地方。这种情况破坏了企业工作的节奏，产生了突击和停顿的现象，而在建筑部门，则使资金分散到许多新建工程，使建筑期限延长，造价提高，未能按期完工。这种不合理使用国家资金的做法造成了资金的冻结，降低了投资的效力，破坏了各经济部门按比例的发展，最后使国民经济遭到重大损失。
    为了迅速消除上述缺点和为了正确地利用全部资源和潜力来保证国民经济的进一步有计划的发展，苏共中央全体会议决定：
    一、在1957年上半年把苏联发展国民经济的第六个五年计划提交苏联最高苏维埃审查和批准。
    在完成编制第六个五年计划的工作的时候，以苏共第二十次代表大会所规定的五年计划的主要任务为依据，这就是：在优先发展重工业、不断改进技术和提高劳动生产率的基础上，保证进一步大力发展国民经济的各个部门，急速发展农业生产，并在这个基础上大大提高苏联人民的物质福利和文化水平，在完成苏联的主要经济任务——即在历史上最短的时期内，在按人口计算的产品生产上赶上并且超过最发达的资本主义国家这方面前进一大步。
    二、为了消除在个别工业部门的计划中出现的过度紧张的现象，为了执行生产任务和根据物质资源进行投资的任务，认为必须进一步明确五年计划指示中和1957年计划草案中所规定的某些初步任务。
    在进一步明确任务时根据下列方针：
    （1）保证最合理地和最有效地使用物力和财力来发展国民经济，为此首先要：减少投资额，更加精确地制定建设项目清单，减少建设项目，首先是减少新兴建的建设工程；不得把资金分散用于许多建设工程，要把物力财力集中用于最重要的建设工程和已经开工的项目上去，以便改进对它们的物资保证；
    修改某些不能得到充分物质资源保证的工业部门的计划任务；
    规定在工业中建立必需的物资储备，以便为企业不停顿的、有节奏的工作创造正常的条件；
    （2）设法为住宅建设筹拨更多的资金。必须坚决消除住宅建筑中各种提高造价和减低建筑发展速度的浪费现象，要更好地使用地方建筑材料，积极支持职工群众为了加速住宅建筑所表现的主动性。
    三、斥责个别经济领导人想用计划工作中的缺点来掩饰他们对企业和工程领导无方的做法，谴责他们要求无端降低计划的想法。计划应当切实可行，但是不应当无故降低。计划应当根据技术经济条件，并且考虑利用先进经验和内部的生产潜力，应当发动劳动人民努力不断提高生产。
    四、确定生产任务的出发点是，必须提高劳动人民在制定计划的时候和争取胜利完成和超额完成计划的时候的积极性。为此，应当广泛地号召在各种会议上认真讨论企业和集体农庄的远景计划，并且定期检查这些计划的执行情况。
    今后仍然必须提高加盟共和国在经济建设中的作用，激发和支持它们主动去寻找和更好地利用地方资源和潜力，来提高工业品和日用品的产量。这要求提高各加盟共和国的各级领导机关对完成国家计划的责任心，加强它们在动员群众解决党和政府提出的各项任务中的组织作用。
    五、责成一切经济领导人员，苏维埃、党和工会组织坚决消除经济领导工作中的缺点，采取有效措施防止物质资源的分散，争取全面发掘企业的内部潜力，改进现有设备的使用，保证完成生产和建筑计划，提高劳动生产率，在技术进步的基础上降低产品成本和改进产品质量，迅速推广新技术，改进劳动组织和完善生产工艺规程。必须同墨守陈规和官僚主义进行斗争，展开批评和自我批评，全力支持劳动人民的创造积极性和主动精神。
    苏共中央全会提醒党、苏维埃、经济、工会和共青团组织以及我们全体工作人员注意，本决议所提出的任务是由国家的发展进程决定的，无条件地执行这些决议是苏维埃国家的切身需要。这里所指的是：要使生产力有新的提高，增加社会财富，从而进一步加强我们国家的经济实力和加强国防力量，进一步提高苏联人民的物质福利。
  在资本主义世界里，各国之间、垄断资本集团之间的竞争日益尖锐和扩大。为了追求最大限度的利润，垄断资本日益加紧剥削工人阶级，奴役农民，向劳动群众的生活水平发动进攻。殖民国家通过帝国主义扩张来寻找投资的新范围，力图用首先是奴役经济不发达国家的手段来扩大资本主义剥削的领域。但是，这种帝国主义扩张势必引起这些国家的人民反抗的增长和民族解放运动的蓬勃高涨。这一切不可避免地导致资本主义经济的进一步军事化，导致扩充军备，资本主义制度内部矛盾的进一步尖锐和加深，并且清楚地表明这种制度是不稳定的，是注定要在历史上消灭的。
    苏维埃社会主义制度没有资本主义生产方式的这一切毛病和极其深刻的矛盾。
    苏联在为加强牢不可破的团结和发展社会主义各国的兄弟合作而斗争，它在执行和平和同所有爱好和平人民友好的政策，它满怀信心地沿着列宁的道路前进。苏联人民正在以全部力量和创造精力来实现共产党所拟定的建设计划。他们在稳定的环境中从事劳动，他们知道，苏维埃国家在不屈不挠地保卫人民的利益，始终如一地捍卫着世界和平事业。
    苏联人民坚定地遵循着伟大列宁的学说，在共产党的领导下解决了一系列的建设和发展强大的社会主义工业和社会主义农业的任务。现在，我们已经具备了过渡到同共产主义建设现阶段相适应的经济发展新的更高阶段的一切必需条件。
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议相信，工人阶级、集体农民、苏维埃知识分子将要更广泛地开展社会主义竞赛，争取完成和超额完成生产计划，并且竭尽全力来极其充分地利用每个工业企业、每个工地、全部集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的生产潜力和后备力，以便在这个基础上胜利实现苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的具有历史意义的各项决议。
    关于改进苏联国民经济领导问题的决议
    （根据布尔加宁同志的报告通过）
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议指出，目前正在根据苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的指示实现着一系列的重要措施，来改进国家计划工作，消除经济管理上的过分集中现象，提高加盟共和国在经济建设中的作用以及进一步扩大苏联各部、经济管理机构和企业的权力，精减行政管理机关。党和政府实行的措施充分符合列宁的社会主义经营原则，这些原则的基础是在经济建设领导工作中的民主集中制。列宁早在苏维埃政权建立后的最初几个月就已经指出：“我们当前的任务正是在经济方面实行民主集中制……”
    国民经济领导工作中的民主集中制是从社会主义大生产的本质产生的，是从社会主义经济——有计划的经济——的性质产生的，也是从发动千百万劳动人民进行自觉的历史性创造以及参加管理国家建设和经济建设的苏维埃制度的实质产生的。民主集中制要求大力改进计划工作，巩固整个经济活动中的计划基础。与此同时，民主集中制还意味着要极其关心和全面考虑地方经验和地方条件，积极支持和鼓励地方党、苏维埃、经济、工会和共青团组织以及千百万工人、集体农民和知识分子的创造性主动精神。
    苏共中央全会认为有必要指出，在国家计划工作中、首先是在当前的计划中存在着严重的缺点。国家计划委员会和国家经济委员会以及各部对各个生产部门的情况研究得不够，同加盟共和国和自治共和国、边疆区和州、同企业和科学机关的联系不够密切，在编制生产、基本建设和物资技术供应计划的时候犯了严重的疏忽和错误，没有很好地担当起检查国家计划执行情况的任务。
    鉴于党的首要任务是根据苏共第二十次代表大会的指示继续尽一切力量改善对国民经济的领导，中央全会决定：
    一、必须采取措施来根本改善苏联国家经济委员会的年度计划工作，并且赋予它职能去灵活地解决在完成国家计划中随时发生的问题，责成它保证供给完成计划所必需的物质资料。
    国家经济委员会和各部都应该保证最合理最有效地利用生产基金，利用劳动、原料和货币资源。国家经济委员会以及我国一切经济机构的最重要的任务是，有计划地把先进科学技术成就、革新者的宝贵经验、合理化建议者和发明者的建议推广到生产中去。应该认真地注意企业专业化和协作的问题，注意各个生产部门之间的联系和各个经济区域经济活动的互相配合。所有这些措施的实行将能保证高速度地进行社会主义扩大再生产，不断提高劳动生产率——增加产量、改善质量、降低产品成本和提高人民物质福利的主要条件。
    二、全会认为，扩大加盟共和国的权限，对改进国民经济领导工作说来具有特殊的意义，这样作可以在经济建设和文化建设方面贯彻列宁主义的民族政策，可以全面地考虑每个共和国的民族特点和地方资源，并且促进各加盟共和国经济的进一步加强和苏联各民族间友谊的巩固。
    为了消除在经济领导方面过分集中，全会认为必须：
    采取措施以大大地扩大加盟共和国部长会议应当解决的、与完成全联盟和加盟共和国国家计划有关的经济建设和文化建设问题的范围，其中包括基本建设、物资技术供应、劳动生产率、成本、产品销售和拨款等问题；
    保证进一步扩大部、部属总局、劳动人民代表苏维埃和经济企业的权力；
    消除多余的工作重叠的单位，即精简管理机关；
    使中央经济管理机关以及科学研究机关直接靠近相应的国民经济部门的企业的分布地区；
    保障各经济地区和大工业中心内部的经济活动互相配合和协调。
    三、鉴于负责对企业的物资—技术供应的部和主管机关的工作中存在着严重的缺点，认为必须采取组织措施来彻底改善这件工作，以保障更加合理地利用物质资源，不容许把它们堆积在无数的仓库和栈房中。
    四、党和政府和第六个五年计划时期内所提出的争取技术进步和大规模发展社会主义生产的重大任务对经济工作干部，对全体生产领导者和组织者提出了很高的要求。他们应当精通业务，通晓现代科学技术成就，钻研企业的技术和经济，经常了解它们的需求，具体和有目的地领导生产。这一切要求苏维埃经济工作人员严格要求自己和下属，关心地倾听群众的呼声，积极支持他们的创举，顽强地掌握技术知识，扩大经济眼光，改进管理生产的方法。
    五、鉴于团结着几乎所有的职工的工会在改善对经济领导方面应当起极其重大的作用，必须：
    提高工会在制定和执行企业生产财政计划，在解决有关劳动定额和组织、工资、改进企业安全技术等问题方面的作用，特别要提高工会在解决有关住宅建筑和改善工人和职员的物质生活条件等问题方面的作用；
    经常开展社会主义竞赛，把它看作是为完成和超额完成经济计划、不断发展社会主义经济而斗争的有力手段；
    定期举行工人和职员的会议，生产会议，技术会议，经济积极分子会议，先进生产者、合理化建议者和发明者的会议，广泛开展各种科学技术团体的工作。
    应当把苏联工会的活动提到相当的高度，使工会完全不辜负自己的崇高使命，就像列宁所教导的一样，使工会变成“行政的学校、管理的学校、共产主义的学校”。
    六、责成各加盟共和国的共产党中央委员会、苏联共产党的边疆区委员会和州委员会认真改进企业和经济机关的工作，特别注意干部的选择、提拔和合理分配工作，检查党和政府的决议的执行情况，注意在经济管理机关的一切环节中保持严格的纪律。
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议号召一切党组织、所有的共产党员坚决实现苏联共产党第二十次代表大会所规定的任务，即进一步发展苏联的社会主义经济，改进组织工作，根据列宁主义的社会主义管理原则改进对经济建设的领导方法，竭力发挥劳动人民群众的创造主动精神和积极性。（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科24日讯）
