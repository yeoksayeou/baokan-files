    Bizarre Installment Plans
    "U.S. News & World Report" reported on October 19th: American businessmen are innovating credit and installment purchase methods for consumers. Not only can you buy cars and refrigerators on installment plans, but also going to the movies, taking trains, staying in hotels, seeing dentists, eating snacks, and living in universities are becoming popular with installment plans. A store in the southern United States, in order to promote its goods, even conceived the bizarre idea of selling televisions to prisoners in nearby state prisons through installment plans.
