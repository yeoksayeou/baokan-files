Xinhua News Agency, December 5th dispatch from London: British newspapers on December 4th continued to comment on the British government's statement regarding the withdrawal of troops from Egypt. Some right-wing newspapers were very displeased with the statement, while the majority of newspapers called for measures to compensate for the losses Britain had suffered as a result of the invasion of Egypt.

The right-wing "Daily Express" and "Daily Telegraph" were both dissatisfied with the government's statement. The "Daily Express" said, "Lloyd uses decent words to express his position, but this is just an excuse for surrender." The newspaper believes that due to the decision to withdraw troops, Britain has abandoned its "mission in the Middle East."

The Liberal Party's "News Chronicle" welcomed the withdrawal, but pointed out that the decision was "too late and grudging." The newspaper advocated working to make up for the "huge losses – moral, material, political and diplomatic – that Britain has suffered as a result of the attack on Egypt."

When talking about how to safeguard British interests, many newspapers placed their hopes on the United Nations and the United States.

The widely circulated "Daily Mirror" called for the restoration of "Commonwealth unity" and "Anglo-American unity."

Xinhua News Agency, London, December 4th dispatch: Today, British newspapers published the British government's statement on the withdrawal of invading troops from Egypt under the headline "The Great Retreat."

	"Daily Herald" said that the withdrawal of troops was inevitable. It should have been done long ago.
	"The result of the unnecessary and unsuccessful attack on Egypt is extremely painful." The newspaper also said, "The sooner a general election can be held so that we have a capable government, the better."

	"News Chronicle," when commenting on the self-justifying part of the government's statement, pointed out, "The person who started the fire can always say that he woke up the fire brigade and made it take responsibility."

	The pro-government "Times" said that the withdrawal of troops was the only way to go. At the same time, the newspaper expressed the hope that the withdrawal "should be a signal for the US government to take firm initiative in the Middle East and for the United Nations to fulfill its responsibilities."

	"Daily Mail" also said that there was no other way to go but to withdraw troops, although it was a "bitter pill."

	The Conservative newspaper "Daily Telegraph" was very agitated. The newspaper's editorial said, "It is useless to pretend that the decision to withdraw troops from Port Said is not shameful. It seems that...the government's long-term efforts have been almost completely in vain."

	"The Daily Worker" said that the government's statement "tragically concludes an episode created by British foreign policy in this century that has brought about the greatest disaster."

	The newspaper's editorial, in exposing the government's plan, pointed out that Lloyd still insisted on conditions regarding the future of the canal in his statement. "If he has made any retreat, it is a retreat to the starting point of the dispute, and doing so is only to create disputes from scratch again...the same stubborn position as the government's original position shows that the goal is still to 'internationally manage' the canal."

　　英国报刊对撤军声明议论纷纭
    有些报纸指出早就该撤军了
    据新华社5日讯　伦敦消息：英国报纸12月4日继续评论英国政府关于从埃及撤军的声明。一些右翼报纸对这个声明感到非常不快，而大多数报纸要求采取措施来弥补由于侵略埃及而给英国带来的损失。
    右翼的“每日快报”和“每日电讯报”都不满政府的声明。“每日快报”说，“劳埃德用体面的字眼来表示他的立场，然而这只是投降的借口。”这家报纸认为，由于撤军的决定，英国已经放弃了“在中东的使命。”
    自由党的“新闻纪事报”欢迎撤军，但是它指出，这个决定是“为时已晚和勉勉强强的”。这家报纸主张进行工作来弥补“由于进攻埃及而给英国造成的巨大损失——道义的、物质的、政治的和外交的损失”。
    在谈到怎样维护英国的利益的时候，许多报纸都把希望寄托在联合国和美国身上。
    发行量很大的“每日镜报”要求恢复“英联邦的团结”和“美英的团结”。
    据新华社伦敦4日电　今天英国报纸在“大退却”的大标题下登载了英国政府关于从埃及撤退侵略军的声明。
      “每日先驱报”说，撤军是不可避免的。老早就应该这样做了。
  “不必要地和不成功地进攻埃及的结果是极为惨痛的。”这家报纸还说，“能够愈快地举行普选以便使我们有一个有能力的政府，那就愈好。”
      “新闻纪事报”在评论政府声明自我辩解部分的时候指出，“煽起大火的人总是可以说，是他喊醒消防队并且使它负起了责任。”
    亲政府的“泰晤士报”说，撤军是唯一可走的道路，同时，这家报纸表示希望，撤军“应该是美国政府在中东采取坚定的主动行动和联合国履行它的责任的信号”。
      “每日邮报”也说，除了撤军以外，没有其他道路可走。虽然这是一剂“苦药”。
    保守党报纸“每日电讯报”表现得很激动，这家报纸的社论说，
  “假装说从塞得港撤军的决定并不是可耻的那是没有用的，看来，……政府所作的长期的努力几乎完全白费了”。
      “工人日报”说，政府的声明
  “使得一个英国对外政策在本世纪中所制造的带来最大灾难的插曲悲惨地结束了”。
    报纸的社论在揭露政府计划时指出，劳埃德在声明中依然坚持关于运河前途的条件。“假如他作了任何退却的话，那是退到纠纷的起点，并且这样做只是为了再从头开始制造纠纷……和政府本来的立场一样的顽固的立场表明，目的还是要‘国际管理’运河”。
