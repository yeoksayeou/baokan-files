Xinhua News Agency report: Many units of the Fujian Frontline Troops have improved their leadership style during the study of the "Eighth National Congress" documents.

In October and November, various units concentrated on organizing cadres at the regimental level and above to study the "Eighth National Congress" documents. Then, based on understanding the spirit of the "Eighth National Congress" and in connection with the actual situation of the troops, under the leadership of the Communist Party committees at all levels, they conducted inspections of leadership style and studied methods to improve work.

Now, a new atmosphere has emerged in the work of many units. The majority of cadres in leadership organs have gone deep into the companies to help with work. After the commander and deputy commander of a certain anti-aircraft artillery division went to the companies, they ate and slept with the soldiers, and often conducted exercises with the soldiers on the positions at night. They also took advantage of spare time to hold various discussion meetings to solicit soldiers' opinions and help the companies solve specific difficulties. In winter training, many companies have generally adopted the working method of the mass line. A certain company of a certain unit improved the enthusiasm of all soldiers through the "three evaluations" of mass appraisal of teaching plans, management education, and work evaluation, enabling all training to achieve excellent results.

    多数干部深入连队帮助工作
　　福建前线部队改进领导作风
    据新华社讯　福建前线的许多部队在“八大”文件学习中，改进了领导作风。
    各部队在10月和11月间，集中团以上干部学习了“八大”文件。然后在领会“八大”精神和联系部队实际的基础上，在中共各级党委领导下进行了领导作风的检查，并且研究了改进工作的方法。
    现在，许多部队的工作中都出现了新的气象，领导机关的大多数干部都深入连队帮助工作。防空军某师正、副师长到连队以后，和士兵们一起吃饭、睡觉，夜间也常常和士兵们一起在阵地上演习。他们还利用空隙时间，召开各种座谈会征求士兵意见，帮助连队解决具体困难，许多连队在冬季训练中，普遍采用了群众路线的工作方法。某部一连通过群众性的评教案、评管理教育和评工作的“三评”，提高了全连士兵的积极性，使各项训练获得了优秀的成绩。
