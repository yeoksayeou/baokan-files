Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 4th. On the Sichuan River, where transportation tasks are extremely busy, forty-six ships have emerged this year with continuous safe navigation of 20,000 kilometers without accidents. Recently, the employees of these ships received commendations and rewards from the shipping management department.
　　Most of the employees driving these ships are relatively familiar with the river channels and water conditions of the Sichuan River. Zhou Bochang, captain of the "Minzhong" passenger-cargo ship, Yang Dafu, a senior pilot, Lu Yongshen, captain of the "Jingmen" passenger-cargo ship, Deng Junchang, the former captain of the "Wuxia" tugboat, and Ma Zhengmo, captain of the "Minquan" passenger-cargo ship, all have more than 20 years of experience navigating the Sichuan River. In the midst of busy transportation, they are able to unite all the employees on the ship, earnestly implement various rules and regulations, summarize and promote operational and management experiences in navigation, and pay attention not only to rapid and increased transport, but also to the quality and safety of transportation. Mo Jiarui, an advanced producer and captain who once created a record of safe navigation of more than 200,000 kilometers on the Sichuan River, safely navigated more than 40 voyages on the "People's No. 1" ship this year, completing the transportation tasks in a timely manner.

    穿三峡，溯急流，安全迅速行驶
　　四十六条川江轮船的职工受奖
    新华社重庆4日电　在运输任务十分繁忙的川江上，今年以来出现了四十六只连续安全航行二万公里没有发生事故的船只。最近，这批船只的职工受到了航运管理部门的表扬和奖励。
    驾驶这些船只的职工，大部分对川江河道和水性都是比较熟悉的。“民众”客货轮船长周伯昌、大引水杨大福，“荆门”客货轮的船长卢永慎，“巫峡”拖轮的前船长邓君常，“民权”客货轮船长马正模等都已经有二十年以上行驶川江的经验。他们在繁忙的运输当中，能够团结全船的职工，认真贯彻各种规章制度，总结和推广航行当中的操作和管理经验，不但注意了迅速多运，还重视了运输质量和安全。曾经创造安全航行川江二十多万公里纪录的先进生产者、船长莫家瑞，今年在“人民一号”轮上，又安全航行四十多个航次，及时完成了运输任务。
