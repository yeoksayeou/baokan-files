    Sorting Books and Other Matters
    Lù Liántáng
    Mr. Xīdì mentioned in his "Wandering Through the Book Forest" that some libraries pile up many books without sorting them, allowing insects and ants to nest within, making them unusable for serving the advancement of science. The author of "Wandering Through the Book Forest" has a very clear understanding of this situation, so his analysis of the objective and subjective reasons is convincing. He suggests that units with accumulated unorganized books should not be allowed to buy new books until the old books are sorted and put on the shelves. I have a slightly different opinion on this point. I think that all book collecting units can still buy books, but they must ensure that newly purchased books are not accumulated again. A plan should be made for the old books that have not yet been sorted out, and they should be sorted out within a certain period of time so that the books and materials can truly serve science and culture. In order to sort out the old books, the initiative of the library itself is important, but the strength of the library alone is not enough. The attention and support of the government leadership departments are necessary conditions.
    Speaking of buying books, there are indeed some unreasonable phenomena. Every year in the fourth quarter, the work of bookstores and publishing houses always encounters a "famine." Especially at the end of the year, a buying frenzy can be seen in bookstores every year. In order to meet the requirements of book buyers, bookstores in various places send people around to "organize the source of goods." Some, because the variety of books in the local area cannot meet the requirements of book buyers, simply accompany the library manager to the warehouses of the Beijing and Shanghai agencies responsible for shipping to select books.
    Bookstores have already recognized this situation as a "rule." Therefore, when ordering from publishers, the number of books to be published during this period is larger. Thus, printing and binding work is particularly tight during this period. Thus, the supply of paper is also becoming tight (printing, binding, and paper are already tight enough during this period due to the preparation of books for spring schools and winter leisure books for rural areas). Of course, the task of the transportation department is already heavy enough in the fourth quarter, and the transportation of paper and books also rushes to join in the fun.
    The question is, what causes the book supply to be particularly tight in the fourth quarter of each year? As far as I know, there are two reasons. One is that the leading agencies in various places always allocate a large amount of book funds in the fourth quarter. For example, the provincial education department always allocates book funds to the primary and secondary schools under its jurisdiction at the beginning of the fourth quarter. This does not include the book funds of various schools directly under the central government. It can be imagined how much book funds allocated by leading agencies across the country are concentrated at this time to buy books, how can it not cause the tension in the book supply? I really don't understand: why can't the book funds be allocated evenly? Could it be that the first to third quarters are forgotten! Another reason is that by December, various agencies, schools, and libraries have surplus budget funds, and they must be turned over to the state treasury if they are not spent. So, they are generous with the people's money and seek convenience for themselves, buying a large number of books (I suppose they also buy other things). Recently, a school in a certain place gave the bookstore 20,000 yuan at one time to select and purchase books. I estimate that to spend these 20,000 yuan, buying one copy of each type of domestic publication is far from enough. In order to spend the surplus funds, things that violated the national financial system have also happened in the past. For example, some units, at the end of the year, regardless of what books, only want to spend the money, but the bookstore really does not have so many varieties, so they collude with the bookstore to issue invoices for reimbursement first, and wait for the books to be shipped next year to pick them up. Although the comrades in the bookstore made a review of this matter, the book-purchasing unit was at large.
    The above two reasons for the tight book supply in the fourth quarter, after careful consideration, are still phenomena after all. Is it the bureaucracy of the leading organs in allocating funds? Or is it the spending units drilling the "loopholes" in the national financial system? This is worthy of serious consideration by the relevant parties. I think that clarifying this issue is tantamount to finding the essence of the problem.

    整理藏书及其他
    陆联棠
    西谛先生在“漫步书林”里有一则文章谈到，有些图书馆堆积很多图书，没有整理，使虫蚁为窝，不能利用来为向科学进军服务。“漫步书林”的作者对这方面的事情了解得十分清楚，因此他所分析的主客观原因，也令人信服。他建议：对这些积压存书的单位，在没有把旧存书整理上架以前，不许买新书。这一点我稍稍有一些不同的意见。我以为各藏书单位还是可以买书，但是要保证新买的书不许再积压。对旧存还没有整理的书，要订出一个计划来，在一定的时间内整理清楚，使得图书资料确确实实能够为科学文化服务。为了整理旧存图书，图书馆自己的主动是重要的，但仅仅图书馆自己的力量是不够的，政府领导部门的重视和支持是必不可少的条件。
    说到买书，也确乎存在岂有此理的现象。每年到了第四季度，书店、出版社的工作，总要遇上一次“饥荒”。特别是到了年底，在书店里年年可以看到抢购书籍的风潮。各地书店为了满足购书人的要求，派人四出“组织货源”。有些因为当地存书品种大大不能满足购书人的要求，索性陪同图书馆管理人一同到北京、上海负责发货的机构的仓库里挑选。
    书店已经把这样的情况当成“规律”来认识了。于是向出版社订货，凡是这个时期要出版的书，数量就大一些；于是印刷、装订工作在这个时期就特别紧张；于是纸张供应也赶着紧张起来（印刷、装订、纸张，在这个时期，因为准备春季学校用书和农村冬闲用书，原来已经够紧张了的）。当然，交通运输部门的任务，在第四季度本来就够重的，纸张和书籍的运输，也赶上去凑凑热闹。
    问题在于是什么原因促成图书供应在每年第四季度特别紧张？据我所知，原因有两方面。其一是各地领导机关总是在四季度大量下拨图书经费。例如省文教厅对所属各中小学下拨图书经费总是在四季度初。这并不包括中央直属各种学校的图书经费。可以设想全国多少领导机关下拨的图书经费集中在这个时候买书，怎会不引起图书供应的紧张？我真弄不懂：为什么图书经费不能均衡地下拨？终不成一至三季度忘了这件事情！另一个原因是到了12月，各地机关、学校、图书馆，结余预算经费，花不掉就要上缴国库。于是慷人民之慨，为自己谋便利，大量买书（想来总也买别的）。最近某地一个学校，一次交给书店二万元经费选购图书。我估计要花掉这二万元，国内出版物的品种每种购一本是远不能满足的。为了花掉结余经费，过去也发生过破坏国家财政制度的事情。如有些单位，到了年底，不问什么书，只求花掉钱，但书店实在没有那么多品种，于是串同书店先开发票报销，书等明年运到再取。书店同志对这事虽作了检讨，购书单位则逍遥法外。
    造成第四季度图书供应紧张的上述两个原因，仔细想想，毕竟还是现象。到底是领导机关下拨经费工作的官僚主义呢？还是花钱单位钻国家财务制度的“空子”？这是值得有关方面深思的。弄清楚这个问题，我以为算是找到了问题的本质。
