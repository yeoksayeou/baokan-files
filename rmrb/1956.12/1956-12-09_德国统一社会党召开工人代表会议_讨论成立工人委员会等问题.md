Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 8th: According to a report by the German News Agency, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany convened a workers' conference in Berlin on December 7th. The purpose of this conference is to allow worker representatives to discuss with the leading bodies of the Socialist Unity Party the basic issues of economic development for the 1957 plan year and the establishment of workers' committees in factories. The meeting will last for two days.

The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Ulbricht, pointed out at the meeting that the establishment of institutions such as the proposed workers' committees would represent a decisive step forward for the German Democratic Republic in further promoting socialist democracy. The purpose of holding the workers' conference is to conduct extensive discussions in various factories, and on this basis, to draft relevant bills to be submitted to the People's Chamber.

Ulbricht listed some specific powers of the workers' committees, such as participating in discussions on factory plans, dealing with rationalization issues, and solving problems of raising product standards and reducing production costs. Ulbricht pointed out that these tasks of the workers' committees do not conflict with the tasks of the trade unions, whose main task is to be responsible for the social and cultural welfare of workers.

Ulbricht also talked about the methods adopted by Yugoslavia and Poland in this regard and their opinions on this issue. He emphasized that the German Democratic Republic has a high level of industrial development, and there is extensive cooperation between factories, so there is no question of so-called worker self-management of production or autonomy.

Ulbricht finally pointed out that the development of new management methods in the socialist factories of the German Democratic Republic will have a great political influence on the working class in West Germany.

　  德国统一社会党召开工人代表会议
　　讨论成立工人委员会等问题
    新华社柏林8日电　据德意志通讯社报道：德国统一社会党中央委员会12月7日在柏林召开工人会议。召开这次会议的目的是使工人代表同统一社会党领导机构在一起讨论1957计划年度经济发展的基本问题和在工厂中成立工人委员会的问题。会议将举行两天。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希在会上指出：建立建议中的工人委员会之类的机构将使民主德国在进一步发扬社会主义民主的道路上迈进决定性的一步。举行工人会议的目的是，在各工厂中展开广泛的讨论，并且在这个基础上拟定有关的法案提交人民议院。
    乌布利希列举了工人委员会的一些具体职权，例如，参与讨论工厂计划，处理合理化问题，解决提高产品标准、降低生产成本问题等等。乌布利希指出，工人委员会的这些任务同工会的任务并不冲突，工会的主要任务是负责工人的社会和文化福利。
    乌布利希还谈到了南斯拉夫和波兰在这方面所采用的方法和对这个问题的意见。他着重指出，民主德国工业发展水平很高，各工厂之间有着广泛的合作，谈不上所谓工人自己管理生产或自治的问题。
    乌布利希最后指出，民主德国社会主义工厂的新的管理方式的发展将对西德工人阶级有很大的政治影响。
