A Bulky Organization is Harmful and Useless
To the Editor:

　　When the Ministry of Coal Industry was first established in July 1955, the authorized number of staff was 821, with an actual number of over 900. At that time, the leadership planned to streamline by 100 people. However, these 100 people were not streamlined. With the expansion of the organization, the total authorized number increased to 1,035 by June of this year, and the actual number of staff has increased to more than 1,200. If we include affiliated units, the number is over 1,500.

　　Has this large increase in personnel in just over a year been entirely due to business needs? In fact, this is not the case. As far as I know, the phenomenon of overstaffing is quite serious in some bureaus and divisions of our ministry. It is even worth considering whether some bureaus and divisions need to be established at all. For example, our ministry's capital construction work could be managed by one division based on the current business situation. However, the leadership insisted on dividing it into two units: the Capital Construction Management Division and the Capital Construction Technology Division. This increased the authorized number of staff from 62 to 160. Why do this? I believe this is inseparable from the leadership's blindly expanding the organization, disregarding reality under the influence of the "socialist high tide."

　　At the beginning of this year, the central government proposed the slogan of catching up with the world's advanced level in science and technology within twelve years. The leaders of the Technology Division emphasized the need to strengthen the leadership of scientific research work and proposed the establishment of a Scientific Research Section and a Technical Communications Section. The Technical Communications Section has ten cadres, whose task is to collect foreign technical data related to the coal industry, conduct research and analysis, and compile them into written materials for the leadership to refer to. However, due to the small amount of actual work, these comrades feel very distressed. The Scientific Research Section, which actually only leads the daily affairs of three scientific research institutes, is equipped with ten cadres, including four engineers. The division originally had a Coal Washing Section, responsible for guiding the business work of coal washing plants in various enterprises. Under the influence of this year's socialist construction high tide, it was blindly expanded into a bureau, and the authorized number increased from 20 to 51.

　　Originally, there was a Factory Management Section under the Mechanical and Electrical Division, responsible for leading the work of three machinery manufacturing plants, with ten staff members. Generally speaking, the work was done quite well. However, the leaders of the ministry considered the development in the next twelve years and decided to change the section into a Mechanical Manufacturing Bureau (already submitted to the State Council for approval), expanding the authorized number to 31.

　　Let's take the Cadre Management and Cadre Staffing Division as another example. When the Ministry of Coal Industry was first established, the authorized number was 38. This year, after the cadre training work was transferred to the Education Division, the number of personnel should have been reduced, but on the contrary, the number of personnel increased to 44.

　　There are also individual leading comrades who believe that more people are better for getting things done, and thus one-sidedly emphasize the importance of their unit and request an increase in staffing. For example, the Security Section had only 18 people last year, and the work was done just as well. However, now they must increase it to 31. After the number of people increased, the scope became larger, and it no longer looked like a section, so the head of the section has repeatedly requested to change the Security Section into a Security Division.

　　Where do the cadres come from as our ministry's organization gradually expands and the number of personnel continues to increase? They can only be transferred from subordinate enterprises. From January to October 1956 alone, 33 cadres above the section chief level were transferred from grassroots units, including 17 section chiefs and 8 bureau chiefs. Most of these comrades are the strongest cadres in the grassroots units, and they can give full play to their abilities at the lower levels. After being transferred up, some are uneasy because of improper job assignments, and some, although they are more at ease in their work, feel distressed because there is not much work to do.

　　As the organization gradually expands and the number of personnel continues to increase, can the work be done well? The fact is not so. Some divisions have many people and few things to do, and some cadres have nothing to do, which causes various ideological problems. With the increase in the number of cadres in the ministry, the leadership of the grassroots units should be more specific and direct, but this is not the case. Originally, the four coal mines of Kailuan, Fengfeng, Jingxing, and Jingxi were directly led by the ministry. These four mines are closer to Beijing, and it is very convenient to directly come to Beijing to ask for instructions and solve problems. The leadership believes that directly leading these four grassroots units is troublesome, so they decided to establish the Tianjin Coal Mine Administration to specifically manage these four coal mines. In this way, when the Jingxi Coal Mine has problems, it has to go from Beijing to Tianjin to ask for instructions, and then the Tianjin Coal Mine Administration asks the ministry leaders for instructions to solve the problem. This not only increases the levels and wastes manpower, but also makes the ministry leaders more detached from the grassroots and detached from reality.

　　More People Doesn't Necessarily Mean Things Get Done

To the Editor:

　　Staff members of state organs and enterprises should work diligently, but the Agricultural Tax Division of the Ministry of Finance is a different story. This division has a total of thirty-two formal staff members, including two division-level cadres, seven section-level cadres, seven section chief-level cadres, and sixteen clerks and staff members. Thus, cadres above the section chief level account for 50% of the total number of cadres, with each person leading an average of one clerk or staff member. The clerks are also mostly older cadres.

　　Logically, with so many leading cadres, the work must be done well. However, this is not the case. Taking the first half of this year as an example, because there are too many leading cadres and not much work, many things are done by the section chiefs and section chiefs themselves, and the cadres below are very idle. Some comrades have no fixed task all year round, but only deal with "temporary errands." Others, although they have rural assignments every year, on average, they only spend three months in the countryside, three months organizing materials, and the rest of the time doing temporary work, reading, reading newspapers, and resting... Sometimes, although there are some temporary jobs, the division chiefs, section chiefs, and section chiefs have already set out specific methods, and the cadres below only need to follow them. Perhaps some people say: "Isn't it good for the leaders to arrange the work specifically?" Specific leadership should of course be welcomed by the cadres below, but it is terrible for our division to be so specific that cadres only need to act and not use their brains, which will hinder the cadres' enthusiasm.

　　Is the enthusiasm of the leading cadres of this division fully utilized? No. Leaders have their own troubles. Take the division chiefs and section chiefs as an example. All matters, large and small, must be discussed jointly by the division chiefs and section chiefs, and many problems often cannot reach a consistent understanding. For example, drafting a document requires several months of deliberation on the wording alone. If you have an opinion, you change it over, and if he disagrees, you change it back. This year, three documents have been deliberated for more than five months, and the final draft has not yet been finalized.

　　In July, due to some changes in the division's business, the work became even lighter, so the original three sections were changed to two sections. In this way, one section has three or four section chiefs, and with more section chiefs, even the role of the section chief cannot be fully utilized, and the section chief is used as a staff member. Therefore, it is recommended that the leaders seriously consider the problem of overstaffing in our unit.

### 机构庞大有害无益　为什么要这样庞大的机构

    机构庞大有害无益
　　为什么要这样庞大的机构编辑同志：
    煤炭工业部在1955年7月刚成立时，机关编制人数是八百二十一人，实有人数是九百多人，当时领导上准备精简一百人。但是，后来这一百人并没有被精简，随着机关编制的扩大，到今年6月全部编制人数增加到一千零三十五人，现在实有工作人员增加到一千二百多人了，如加上附属单位则在一千五百人以上。
    在短短的一年多的时间内，增加了这么多的人，是不是完全都是因为业务需要呢？事实上并不是这样。据我所知，目前我部有些局和司人浮于事的现象是比较严重的，甚至有些局和司需不需要设立也很值得考虑。如我部的基本建设工作，根据目前的业务情况，由一个司来管理就可以了，但领导上硬要分为基本建设管理司和基本建设技术司两个单位，这样编制人数就从六十二人增加到一百六十人。为什么要这样做呢？我认为这与领导上在“社会主义高潮”的影响下不顾实际地盲目扩大编制的思想是分不开的。
    今年年初中央提出在十二年内在科学技术上要赶上世界先进水平的口号，技术司的领导上就强调要加强对科学研究工作的领导，提出了成立科学研究处和技术通讯处的方案。技术通讯处有十个干部，任务是专门收集有关煤炭工业的外国技术资料，进行研究分析后整理成书面材料供领导上参考。但由于实际工作不多，这些同志感到非常苦闷。科学研究处，实际上只领导三个科学研究院的日常事务，就配备了十个干部，其中有四名工程师。该司原来有个选煤处，负责指导各企业选煤厂的业务工作，也是在今年社会主义建设高潮的影响下盲目扩大为局，编制就由二十人增加到五十一人。
    原来在机电司下设有一个工厂管理处，负责领导三个机械制造厂的工作，有十个工作人员，一般说来工作搞得还不错，但部的领导上考虑今后十二年的发展如何如何，就决定把处改为机械制造局（已报国务院审批），编制扩大为三十一人。
    再拿管理干部和负责干部定员工作的干部司来说，该司在煤炭工业部刚成立时，定员为三十八人，今年把干部培训工作划归教育司领导以后，本应减少人员、但恰恰相反，人员反而增加到四十四人。
    也有个别领导同志认为人多好办事，因而片面强调本单位工作重要，要求增加编制。如保卫处去年只有十八个人，工作也一样做得很好，但现在却一定要增加到三十一个人。人增加以后，摊子大了，再叫处就不像样了，所以该处处长曾多次要求要把保卫处改为保卫司。
    我部机构逐渐扩大，人员日益增多，干部从那里来呢？只有从所属的企业中抽调。单从1956年1月至10月计算，就从基层单位抽调科长以上干部三十三人，其中处长十七人，局长八人。这些同志大部分都是基层单位最强的干部，在下面能够充分发挥他们的作用。调上来后，有的因工作分配不当而不安心，有的虽然工作比较安心，也因工作不多而感到苦闷。
    机构逐渐扩大，人员不断增加，那么工作可以做好了吧？事实也不是这样。有的司人多事情少，有的干部没事干，就闹各种思想问题。部里干部增多了，按理对基层单位的领导应当更具体更直接了，但事实上也不是这样。原来开滦、峰峰、井陉和京西四个煤矿由部来直接领导，这四个矿离北京较近，直接来京请示问题，解决问题都很方便。领导上认为直接领导这四个基层单位很麻烦，决定成立天津煤矿管理局来专管这四个煤矿。这样京西煤矿有问题时就得从北京到天津去请示，然后再由天津煤矿管理局请示部的领导才能解决，这样不仅增多了层次，浪费了人力，而且使部的领导更脱离了基层，脱离了实际。
                            宏　钟
    人多并不好办事编辑同志：
    国家机关和企业部门的工作人员都应当紧张地工作，可是，财政部农业税司却是另一种情况。这个司共有三十二个正式工作人员，其中司长级干部二人，处长级干部七人，科长级干部七人，科员、办事员十六人。这样，科长以上干部就占干部总人数的50％，每人平均领导一个科员或办事员，科员也多是比较老的干部。
    按理说，这样多的领导干部，工作一定是做得好的。事实却并非如此。拿今年上半年的情况来说，因为领导干部太多，工作不多，所以有许多事情都由处长、科长亲自做了，下面干部非常清闲。有一部分同志终年没有一个固定的任务，只是应付“临时差使”而已。另有一部分同志虽然每年都有下乡任务，但平均起来，每年顶多下三个月乡，整理三个月的材料，其余的时间做些临时工作和读书、看报、休息……。有时，虽然有一些临时工作，但是早已有司长、处长、科长定出了具体作法，下面干部只要照着办就行了。也许有人说：“领导上布置工作具体，不是很好吗？”具体领导，当然应当受到下面干部的欢迎，但是像我们这个司具体到让干部只要动手，不要动脑的地步，却是很糟糕的，这会阻碍干部积极性的发挥。
    这个司的领导干部的积极性是不是得到充分发挥了呢？也没有。领导上有领导上的苦恼，就拿司长、处长来说，一应大小事情，都得司长、处长共同商量，而且有许多问题常常不能得出一致的认识。比如起草一个文件，单单推敲文字，要推敲几个月，你有意见，就改过来，他不同意再改过去。今年有三个文件，就一直推敲了五个多月，还没有最后定稿。
    在7月间，由于司里业务有些改变，工作也就更加清淡，所以就把原来的三个处改为二个处。这样一个处就有三个或者四个处长，处长多了，连科长的作用也不能得到充分发挥了，科长被当作科员使用了。因此，建议领导上认真考虑一下我们单位的人浮于事的问题。
