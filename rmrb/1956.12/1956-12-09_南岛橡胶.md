South Island Rubber
　　Feng Ziping

　　Hainan Island is known as a treasure island. It not only has inexhaustible aquatic resources, rich minerals, and primeval forests, but also precious tropical cash crops. Rubber is one of these valuable tropical crops.

　　Standing in an old rubber plantation and looking around, the rubber trees are neat and tidy, with luxuriant branches and leaves, forming a green and shady forest that stretches as far as the eye can see, remaining evergreen in all seasons. In the early morning, before daybreak, male and female rubber tappers carry a pair of small iron buckets and hurry into the rubber plantation. Using a sharp little knife, they lightly shave off some of the rubber tree bark, and the milky white latex drips along the freshly cut marks into cups hanging on the trees. Before noon, the rubber tappers carry the latex back to process it and make rubber sheets, to supply rubber factories for manufacturing various finished products. Autumn is the busiest season for rubber production. In addition to tapping rubber (ten months a year), the workers in the rubber plantation are also busy picking the fruits of the rubber trees for seedling cultivation, and transplanting the seedlings cultivated in the previous year to newly reclaimed plantation land.

　　Rubber trees have been cultivated on Hainan Island for more than fifty years. The first rubber trees were brought back from Southeast Asia by individual overseas Chinese and successfully trial-planted on Hainan Island. After that, many overseas Chinese successively came to Hainan Island to invest in and manage rubber plantations. The local people, seeing the high returns from planting rubber, also vigorously planted rubber trees. In the southeast coastal areas, the central areas, and the western areas of Hainan Island, many rubber plantations appeared one after another. During the Anti-Japanese War, after the Japanese imperialists occupied Hainan Island, they seized the rubber plantations, forced the workers to tap rubber indiscriminately, and even tapped small rubber trees that were not yet of tapping age. Some rubber plantations were set on fire by the Japanese invaders. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, due to the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary government and the decline in rubber prices, many rubber plantations gradually became deserted.

　　New China has given the rubber industry of Hainan Island a new life. In the summer of 1950, when the sound of cannons liberating Hainan Island had just subsided, large numbers of workers from the mainland of the motherland came to Hainan Island, worked hard to reclaim large tracts of wasteland, established dozens of state-owned farms, and planted hundreds of thousands of mu of rubber trees. Some patriotic overseas Chinese also came to Hainan Island to invest in the development of the rubber industry, planting thousands of mu of new rubber trees. The original rubber plantations on the island, with the support of the government, also quickly restored and developed production. Especially in state-owned and joint state-private rubber plantations, the workers' level of awareness has improved, and the efficiency of labor and the quality of rubber production have improved rapidly. For example, in the state-owned Xilian Rubber Reclamation Farm, in 1953, each worker could only manage twenty-five mu of rubber, but now they can manage fifty mu. The rubber sheet production workers at this farm have improved their operating techniques, so that the quality of the rubber sheets produced by the farm has reached a very high level.

　　Hainan Island is located in the tropics, with high temperatures and humidity, fertile soil, and abundant rainfall, which is suitable for the growth of rubber trees. Newly planted rubber trees can start tapping rubber in seven or eight years, and each tree can be tapped for forty or fifty years. At the same time, the local area has rubber tree seedlings, and the people also have rich experience in planting and managing rubber trees.

　　In order to comprehensively develop the rubber industry of Hainan Island, from last winter to this summer, the survey team jointly formed by the Guangdong Provincial Subtropical Resources Development Committee and the relevant departments of Hainan Island comprehensively investigated the tropical and subtropical resources on the island, and found millions of mu of fertile wasteland that can be planted with rubber trees. Recently, the Hainan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party stipulated in the plan for comprehensively developing Hainan Island that it will plant all the millions of mu of wasteland suitable for planting rubber trees on the island within the next twelve years. At that time, Hainan Island will become a beautiful rubber island in the South China Sea of our country.

### 南岛橡胶

　　南岛橡胶
　　冯子平
    海南岛被人称为宝岛，它不仅有取之不尽的水产资源，有丰富的矿产，有原始大森林，还有珍贵的热带经济作物。橡胶就是珍贵的热带作物之一。
    站在老橡胶园里，举目四望，橡胶树整整齐齐，枝叶茂盛，绿荫成林，四季常青，一望无际。早晨，天蒙蒙亮，男女割胶工人们挑着一对小铁桶，匆匆忙忙地走进橡胶园，用一把锐利的小刀，轻快地削去一些胶树皮，乳白的胶汁沿着刚割的裂痕滴进挂在树上的杯中。在中午以前，割胶工人们都挑着胶汁回来，进行胶汁加工和制成胶片，以供应橡胶工厂制造各种成品。秋天，是橡胶生产最紧张的季节。橡胶园里除了割胶外（一年割胶十个月），工人们还忙着采摘橡胶树的果实育苗，并且把前一年培育的种苗移植到新垦的园地上。
    海南岛上栽培橡胶树已经有五十多年的历史。最初的橡胶是由个别华侨从南洋带回橡胶树苗在海南岛试种成功的。这以后，就有许多华侨陆续不断地到海南岛来投资经营橡胶园。当地人民，看到了种橡胶收益大，也大力种植橡胶树。在海南岛东南沿海地区、中部和西部地区，先后出现了许多橡胶园。抗日战争时期，日本帝国主义占领海南岛后，侵占了胶园，强迫工人乱割胶，连还不到割胶年龄的小胶树也割。有一部分胶园被日寇放火烧了。抗战胜利后，由于国民党反动政府的压迫和橡胶价格下降，许多胶园逐渐荒废了。
    新中国使海南岛的橡胶业获得了新生。当1950年夏天，解放海南岛的炮声刚刚平息，祖国大陆的大批工人，不辞劳苦地到海南岛开垦大片荒地，建立了几十个国营农场，种植了几十万亩橡胶树。有一些爱国华侨也到海南岛投资发展橡胶业，新栽种了数千亩橡胶树。岛上原有的胶园，在政府扶助下，也很快地恢复和发展了生产。特别是国营和公私合营的橡胶园里，由于工人觉悟水平提高，劳动效率和制胶质量提高很快。例如国营西联橡胶垦殖场，1953年每个工人只能管理二十五亩橡胶，现在能管理五十亩了。这个场制胶工人改进操作技术，使场里制的胶片质量达到了很高的水平。
    海南岛地处热带，高温多湿，土地肥沃，雨水充足，适合树胶成长。新种的树胶七八年就可以开始割胶，每株能割胶四五十年。同时，当地有树胶种苗，人民也有种植和经营树胶的丰富经验。
    国家为了全面发展海南岛的橡胶事业，去年冬天到今年夏天，曾经由广东省亚热带资源开发委员会和海南岛有关部门联合组成的勘察队，全面调查岛上的热带和亚热带资源，找到了数百万亩可以栽种橡胶树的肥沃荒地。最近，中共海南区委员会制定全面开发海南岛的规划中规定，将在今后十二年内把岛上数百万亩能种橡胶树的荒地全部种上。那时，海南岛将变成我国南海上一个美丽的橡胶岛。
