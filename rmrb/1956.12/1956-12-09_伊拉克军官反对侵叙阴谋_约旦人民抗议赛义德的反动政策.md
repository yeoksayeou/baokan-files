Xinhua News Agency, December 8th: According to a TASS dispatch from Damascus on December 7th: The Syrian newspaper "Victory" reports that some brigade commanders in the Iraqi army have passed a resolution: if Prime Minister Said orders an attack on Syria, the troops under their command will not participate in this war because such an action is a crime against Arab countries. These commanders have notified King Faisal of this decision.

The newspaper writes that this decision has greatly disturbed Said, and he has ordered the transfer of the brigade commanders, but this order has not yet been carried out.

Xinhua News Agency, December 8th: Amman dispatch: Across Jordan, work was halted for two hours on December 7th to protest against the policies of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Said, which are hostile to Syria and Egypt, and the arrest of many opposition figures.

Prior to the strike, many people delivered speeches during Friday prayers in mosques throughout the country, condemning the policies of the Said government and attacking the Baghdad Pact.

    据新华社8日讯　据塔斯社大马士革7日讯：据叙利亚“胜利报”从伊拉克得到的消息说，伊拉克军队一些旅的指挥官通过了一项决定：如果首相赛义德下令进攻叙利亚，他们所指挥的军队将不参加这场战争，因为这个行动是一种反对阿拉伯国家的罪行。这些指挥官已经将这项决定通知了国王费萨尔。
    报纸写道，这个决定使赛义德非常不安，他已经下令调动旅指挥官，可是这个命令直到现在还没有执行。
