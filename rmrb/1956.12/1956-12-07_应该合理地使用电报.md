　　Reasonable Use of Telegrams Should Be Made
　　Wu Qingtong
　　Government telegrams are a tool for state organs to connect and guide work. The main problem with the use of telegrams in state organs at present is the excessive and unreasonable use of telegrams. For example, the State Council issued 558 official documents in the first half of 1956, and 651 telegrams in the same period. After a rough inspection, 35% of these 651 telegrams should not have been sent by telegram, and 27% should not have been in telegram form (without cryptographic translation and telecommunications transmission). They should have been sent as official documents. Only 38% should have been sent by telegram. It is understood that similar phenomena exist in other agencies.
　　Telegrams are overused because telegrams themselves have the advantage of being "fast," and because of historical habits, telegrams are often sent to leading comrades first, which gives telegrams the additional advantage of "being able to meet with leading comrades directly and facilitating problem-solving." On the other hand, there is neither a clear system for what kind of things should be done by official documents and what kind of things should be done by telegram, nor is there anyone to supervise and control them. Therefore, some things that are not urgent are telegraphed simply to "draw the attention of the leading comrades of the recipient organization" and "facilitate problem-solving." Even documents sent to agencies in the same city are sent by telegram. Because it is completely unnecessary to go through cryptographic translation and telecommunications transmission, documents in telegram form are produced.
　　I think it is necessary to point out that the practice of some agencies, after receiving telegrams, of sending them to leading comrades first, regardless of their importance or urgency, is not appropriate. In fact, some routine telegrams can be sent to the competent departments for processing first, so as not to drag the leading comrades into piles of documents and promote bureaucracy. Some agencies handle all official documents according to a bottom-up procedure, resulting in official document travels, delays, and errors. This bureaucratic practice should be corrected.
　　The main disadvantages of excessive and unreasonable use of telegrams are: First, it increases unnecessary telegraph expenses. For example, the State Council spends about 500,000 yuan on telegraph expenses every year. If we calculate according to the fact that 47.9% of the telegrams sent should not have been sent by telegram, then about 240,000 yuan is wasted a year. This is just the figure for one agency of the State Council. If we add up the waste figures for the whole country, it will be a huge figure. In addition, the waste of increasing staffing is incalculable. Second, due to the restrictions of the confidentiality system, administrative business matters sent by cipher telegram are difficult for the telegram receiving agency to handle. Third, documents in telegram form are mixed with cipher telegrams, so many agencies have to treat them as cipher telegrams, which unnecessarily adds many confidentiality restrictions and also affects the normal processing of these documents. If they are not treated as cipher telegrams, it is easy to cause loopholes in the confidentiality management of cipher telegrams.
　　At present, China's transportation conditions have been fundamentally improved compared with the war years. Not only is there a postal organization covering the whole country, but also a confidential transportation organization. Most provinces have not only modern land and water transportation, but also air transportation. We should, according to this new situation, compress the amount of telegrams used and abolish documents in telegram form.
　　I believe that the principles for using telegrams should be: cipher telegrams should be used for things that are both urgent and confidential. Plain text telegrams should be used for things that are only urgent but not confidential. Official documents should be used for things that are not urgent, regardless of whether they are confidential or not. Documents with too many words and attachments should be sent by official documents as much as possible, and not by telegrams.
　　If the above principles are correct, how should they be implemented? I would like to make the following suggestions:
　　1. Drafters, reviewers, and signers should pay attention to the rational use of telegrams.
　　2. The exchange of documents between various agencies in the same city is prohibited from using telegram form, and all should be changed to official documents.
　　3. Authorize the responsible comrades of the secretarial departments at all levels to carry out necessary supervision. For documents that do not need to be sent by telegram and can be sent by official documents, they can be changed to official document transmission after contacting the sponsoring unit; or, for the same document sent to many places, according to the degree of urgency, they can be sent by telegram or land, without delaying matters.
　　4. In view of the fact that many agencies have not yet divided the standards of confidentiality, and it is very difficult for the central government to formulate a unified standard that can meet the needs of all aspects, it is necessary for each agency to study and formulate a rough interim measure based on the actual situation from the perspective of national security, and gradually improve it through practice. The drafter divides the plain text according to this method, and the secretarial department pays attention to balance.

### 应该合理地使用电报

　　应该合理地使用电报
　　吴庆彤
    公务电报是国家机关上下联系指导工作的一种工具。目前在国家机关中，使用电报上存在的主要问题是：过多地不合理地使用电报。如国务院1956年上半年发出公文五百五十八件，同一时期发出电报六百五十一件。经过粗略检查，这六百五十一件电报中，有35％不该用电报，27％不该用电报形式（没有经过密码翻译和电讯传递），都应该用公文，只有38％是应该用电报的。据了解，在其他机关也有类似现象。
    电报所以过多，一方面是由于电报本身具有“快”的优点，同时由于历史习惯，电报的处理程序多是先送领导同志，因而给电报又增加了“能直接和领导同志见面，便于解决问题”的优点；另一方面，什么样的事情用公文？什么样的事情用电报？既没有一个明确的制度，又没有人进行监督控制。因此，有些本来不急的事情，只是为了“引起受文机关的领导同志重视”，“便于解决问题”而发电报。甚至发给住在同一城市的机关的文件，也用电报，因为完全不必要通过密码翻译和电讯传递，于是就产生了电报形式的文件。
    我觉得有必要指出：有些机关，收到电报后，不分轻重缓急，都先送领导同志的作法，是不够妥当的。其实，有些事务性的电报，可以先送主管部门处理，以免把领导同志拖在文件堆里，助长官僚主义。有的机关把所有的公文都按自下而上的程序来处理，以致形成公文旅行，失时误事，这种官僚主义的做法，应该加以纠正。
    过多地不合理地使用电报的主要害处是：一、增加了不必要的电报费开支。如国务院每年开支电报费约在五十万元左右，如果按不该发电报的占已发电报的47.9％计算，一年即浪费二十四万元左右。这仅是国务院一个机关的数字，如果把全国的浪费数字加起来，将是一笔很大的数字。再加上增加编制的浪费数字，更是不可胜计。二、由于保密制度的限制，用密码电报发出的行政业务事情，受电报机关不好处理。三、电报形式的文件和密码电报混在一起，许多机关不得不当密码电报处理，徒然加上了许多不必要的保密限制，也影响了这些文件的正常处理。假如不当密码电报处理，又容易给密码电报的保密管理招致漏洞。
    目前我国的交通条件，已较战争时期有了根本改善。不仅有遍及全国的邮递组织，而且还有机要交通组织；多数省份不仅有现代化的水陆交通，而且还有航空交通，我们应该根据这种新情况，压缩电报的使用量，取消电报形式的文件。
    我认为，使用电报的原则应该是：既紧急又机密的事情用密码电报。只紧急不机密的事情用明码电报。不紧急的事情，不论机密与否，都应该使用公文。文字过多，有附表的文件，应尽量使用公文，不用电报。
    如果上述原则正确的话，如何贯彻实行呢？特提出以下几点建议：
    一、拟稿人、核稿人、签发人应注意合理地使用电报。
    二、住在同一城市的各个机关之间的来往文件，禁止使用电报形式，一律改用公文。
    三、授权各级秘书部门的负责同志进行必要的监督。对于不必要用电报，可以用公文传递的文件，经与主办单位联系后，可以改用公文传递；或将发给许多地方的同一文件，根据缓急程度，在不误事的原则下，分别电发、陆送。
    四、鉴于许多机关还没有划分明密的标准，由中央制定一个统一的能够满足各方面需要的标准又很困难，因此，各机关就有必要根据实际情况，从国家安全的角度出发，研究制定一个粗略的暂行办法，经过实践逐步求得完善。由拟稿人根据这个办法划分明密，秘书部门注意平衡。
