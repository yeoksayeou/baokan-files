　　Is Butler Also Going to Take a Break?
    British Prime Minister Eden has gone on leave due to "excessive fatigue," and Lord Privy Seal Butler is temporarily acting as Prime Minister. Although Butler is not formally the Prime Minister, his encounters in Parliament are no better than Eden's. Just as Eden was leaving for Jamaica on the 23rd, he was subjected to fierce questioning in the House of Commons, leaving him flustered and embarrassed.
    The question in the House of Commons was whether the British and French attack on Egypt was in collusion with Israel and whether the United States was notified in advance. Butler said, "There was no prior agreement." Thereupon, Labour MPs demanded that he explain in detail the contents of Eden's correspondence with Eisenhower before and after the start of the offensive against Egypt.
    Butler repeated Lloyd's argument, stubbornly denying the fact of "collusion," and flatly rejected the demands of the Labour MPs. According to him, these letters were communications between two heads of state and could not be made public; if they were made public, they would "lose their value." Butler apparently believed that the "value" of keeping these letters secret lay in preventing public condemnation.
    However, the "value" that Butler spoke of no longer exists. Just a few days before this questioning in the House, British and American newspapers such as "The Times," "The Manchester Guardian," "The New York Times," and "The Washington Post" had already reported a large amount of material proving that the military actions of Britain, France, and Israel in Egypt were collusive.
    It seems that Butler and Eden have made the same mistake: he is unwilling to face public opinion and is only racking his brains to deceive public opinion in order to continue to implement the policy of aggression. Therefore, in the end, he may end up like Eden, suffering from "excessive fatigue" and having to leave office for a rest.

### 巴特勒也要去休养吗？

　　巴特勒也要去休养吗？
    英国首相艾登因“过度疲劳”休养去了，掌玺大臣巴特勒暂时代理首相职务。巴特勒虽然没有正式作首相，但是他在国会里的遭遇并不比艾登好些。就在艾登23日动身到牙买加去的时候，他在下议院就受到了猛烈的质询，被弄得左支右绌，十分狼狈。
    下议院质询的问题是，英法进攻埃及是不是和以色列串通一气，并在事先通知了美国？巴特勒说，“没有事先取得协议”。于是，工党议员要求他从头到尾详细说明艾登在开始进攻埃及前后同艾森豪威尔通信的内容。
    巴特勒重复劳埃德的论调，硬不承认“串通一气”的事实，并且断然拒绝了工党议员的要求。据他说，这些信件是两个国家元首之间的通信，不能公开；如果公开了，就会“失去价值”。巴特勒显然是认为这些信件保密的“价值”，就在于能杜绝舆论的谴责。
    但是，巴特勒所谓的“价值”早就不存在了。就在下院这次质询的前几天，英国和美国的报纸“泰晤士报”、“曼彻斯特卫报”、“纽约时报”、“华盛顿邮报”等报，已经报道了大量的材料，证明了英国、法国和以色列在埃及的军事行动是串通一气的。
    看来，巴特勒和艾登犯了同样的毛病，他不肯正视舆论，而只是绞尽脑汁地来欺骗舆论，以便继续执行侵略政策。因此，到头来他也有可能像艾登一样，落得一个“过度疲劳”，不得不离职休养而去。
