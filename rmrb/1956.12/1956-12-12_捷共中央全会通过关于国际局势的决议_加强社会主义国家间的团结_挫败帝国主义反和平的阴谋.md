Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 11th: The Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party held a plenary session on December 5th and 6th and passed a resolution on the international political situation.

The resolution pointed out that the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party fully agreed with the report "Conclusions on the Current International Situation and the Work of the Party" made by its First Secretary, Comrade Novotny, at the meeting. The Central Committee demonstrated complete unanimity on all issues and unanimously approved the actions of the Party and the government in foreign policy. The plenary session, based on the discussions held, drew conclusions on some current international and domestic issues.

The forces of peace, democracy, and socialism are undergoing an important stage in the struggle against imperialism.

The resolution said that the current development of the international situation proves that the conclusions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are correct. The forces of peace, democracy, and socialism are now undergoing an important stage in the struggle against imperialism. In this struggle, they have achieved undeniable successes and gained valuable experience, while at the same time promoting a certain degree of relaxation in international tensions. However, this development is contrary to the aggressive activities of imperialism. Ignoring the interests and desires of peace-loving people in all countries, the imperialists have attempted to reverse this trend through the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt, through conspiracies to carry out counter-revolutionary subversion in Hungary, and through intensified movements to incite people against socialist countries, against the international working-class movement, and against all peace-loving forces. The most reliable guarantee for thwarting imperialist conspiracies against peace and socialism is to unswervingly strengthen the unity among socialist countries, led by the Soviet Union.

Equal and cooperative relations have been established between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.

The Soviet government's declaration on relations between socialist countries, issued on October 30 this year, clearly demonstrates that the unity of socialist countries is based on the principles of proletarian internationalism, equality of rights, sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, and the closest economic, political, and cultural cooperation. Such a relationship has been established between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, and between the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Similarly, we are developing our relations with all socialist countries on the basis of Leninist principles.

We express our sincere comradely support for the heroic struggles of all Communist parties in capitalist countries for the rights of the working people, for the unity of the working class, and for international peace. We particularly respect the fraternal Communist parties of France and Italy, which have demonstrated their firm will, their unity, their political maturity, and their loyalty to the ideas of Marxism-Leninism under particularly difficult conditions.

Cooperation between socialist countries and countries that have won national liberation struggles has shown great strength.

At present, the national liberation movement in colonial and dependent countries has greatly developed, and the entire imperialist colonial system is accelerating its disintegration under the blows of this movement. The peaceful cooperation between countries of the socialist world system and countries that have won national liberation struggles has particularly demonstrated its enormous strength, especially when the imperialists perfidiously attacked Egypt in an attempt to subdue it. All socialist countries and progressive people around the world stood with the Egyptian people against imperialist aggression. Our country and our people also fully support Egypt's just efforts to expel the British, French, and Israeli aggressors, and demand that they bear full responsibility and compensate for the enormous losses they have caused.

Fully supports the Soviet government's military assistance to the Hungarian government.

The resolution said that our entire party, the entire working class, and the entire people have been closely watching the events in Hungary over the past few weeks with great attention and great anxiety. The attempt to carry out counter-revolutionary subversion in Hungary is an important part of the extensive conspiracy of imperialism against socialism and progress. Our Party Central Committee fully agrees with and supports the actions of the Soviet government, which, at the request of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, provided military assistance to suppress the counter-revolution, defend the Hungarian People's Democratic regime, and restore domestic order. The current development of the situation in Hungary proves that this approach by the Soviet Union is correct, and history will prove this in the future.

We once again express our enthusiastic and comradely support for the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and its Central Committee. We welcome the efforts of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government to meet the legitimate demands of workers and all working people and its firm stance in defending the achievements of the People's Democracy. We are convinced that the Hungarian working class, in its persistent efforts to correct all past shortcomings and mistakes, will soon mobilize all its strength, stand at the forefront of the working people, complete its historical task, and guarantee the construction of socialist Hungary. In this endeavor, it will receive constant support from our country and other socialist countries, as well as from Communist and Workers' parties.

Severely condemns the provocative movement by world reactionaries against socialist countries.

The resolution said that we severely condemn the provocative movement launched by world reactionaries against the Hungarian People's Republic, the Soviet Union, and the People's Democratic countries. The Czechoslovak people oppose the abuse of the United Nations platform to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs.

The resolution then said that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party played a major role in resolving the serious political and economic problems in Poland. We value the approach of the leading organs of the Polish United Workers' Party, which openly pointed out the path to overcoming shortcomings, errors, and difficulties in order to thwart all conspiracies carried out by international and domestic reactionaries. We heartily welcome the results achieved in the recent Moscow talks between Poland and the Soviet Union.

Tito's speech contained many remarks that were unacceptable.

In discussing Comrade Tito's speech in Pula on the events in Hungary, the resolution said that, in addition to some correct conclusions and assessments on the international situation, this speech also included other remarks that the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party unanimously considered to be incorrect and not in accordance with the interests of the international communist movement, and not in accordance with the interests of Communist and Workers' parties in various countries.

We certainly cannot agree with the practice of dividing various Communist parties and their leading bodies according to certain "tendencies." This is clearly interfering in the internal affairs of these parties. This division also has a close impact on the international unity of the communist movement, which is an important source of strength and achievement for the communist movement in the struggle against the offensive of the imperialists, safeguarding the interests of the working people, and striving for the victory of socialism.

The resolution believes that Tito's statements on the issue of the cult of personality are also incorrect.

The resolution said that it is very clear that any effort to regard certain specific forms and tendencies of socialist construction as "models" universally applicable to other countries is contrary to Leninism and the international experience of the working-class movement.

Creatively applying the experience of fraternal parties in building socialism.

In our country's socialist construction, we have consistently proceeded from a Marxist-Leninist analysis of our own situation and national characteristics, while always remembering our international obligations.

At the same time, we are creatively applying the rich experience accumulated by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the struggle to build the first socialist country. We also carefully absorb, and will continue to further absorb and adopt, the experience of all socialist countries and fraternal parties in building socialism.

We will also strive to continuously deepen and strengthen our friendly and comradely relations with the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, and to objectively discuss and clarify all issues that are important to both sides. The basis of our mutual relations will always be the teachings of Marxism-Leninism and the interests of the people of our two countries and the entire international communist movement.

The firm unity of the working people guarantees the consolidation of the People's Democratic regime.

The resolution, in discussing domestic issues in Czechoslovakia, said that in the past few days, our working class has demonstrated its political maturity and class consciousness, and has demonstrated its unwavering loyalty to the ideas of proletarian internationalism. Along with the working class, our peasants and working intellectuals have also clearly and firmly expressed their approval of the policies of the Party and the government, and expressed their willingness to make more contributions to strengthening the People's Democratic motherland. The growth of initiative and labor enthusiasm in enterprises and rural areas, the development of socialist emulation, the establishment of new unified agricultural cooperatives—this is the answer to the imperialist sabotage of the conspiracies against the peace and freedom of the people of all countries. The Communist Party has once again proven that it is leading the entire people of our country forward unwaveringly along the correct path. The firm unity of the working people does not allow the remnants of the overthrown exploiting classes to carry out any slightest attempt to harm our People's Democratic regime.

Close cooperation with fraternal parties in various countries is of decisive significance for the struggle for peace and the construction of socialism.

We will further advance along the path of resolutely and actively fighting for the peace and security of the people of all countries, and will unswervingly implement the Leninist peaceful foreign policy based on the principles of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between socialism and capitalism. We will support all efforts and actions aimed at easing international tensions, and will play the greatest possible active role in this regard. We will resolutely fight against all conspiracies of the forces of imperialist aggression, and will further guide the people of our country to heighten their vigilance against all enemies at home and abroad.

We will further strengthen and develop our fraternal relations with the Soviet Union by all means, consolidate the world socialist system, and develop political, economic, and cultural relations between socialist countries. The Warsaw Treaty is a manifestation of the strong alliance of these countries and a guarantee of their security, and unswervingly fulfilling this treaty is beneficial to our common cause and the cause of peace.

Maintaining close cooperation and fraternal relations with Communist and Workers' parties in various countries is of decisive importance for our struggle for peace and the construction of socialism. At the same time, the principled unity of our Party with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is more important than ever.

The resolution concludes by saying that, in the face of the recent international situation, we will unswervingly carry out our basic tasks and our domestic policies: further develop our country's economic strength and continuously improve the people's living standards. We will continuously expand our country's socialist democracy, allowing the working people to participate more in the leadership and management of the state. The Party is the guarantee for the further victory of the struggle of our people for peace and socialist construction, and its policies are gaining greater trust than before. We will continue to work to further deepen and strengthen this trust. We must always maintain close contact with the broadest masses of the working people. We will advance more resolutely under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, filled with the spirit of proletarian internationalism and socialist patriotism.

    捷共中央全会通过关于国际局势的决议
    加强社会主义国家间的团结  挫败帝国主义反和平的阴谋
    新华社布拉格11日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会12月5日和6日举行的全体会议，通过了关于国际政治局势的决议。
    决议指出，捷共中央完全同意它的第一书记诺沃提尼同志在会上所作的“目前国际局势和党的工作的结论”的报告。中央委员会在一切问题上都表现出完全的一致，并且一致赞同党和政府在外交政策方面的行动。全会根据会议进行的讨论对目前一些国际和国内问题作出了结论。
    和平、民主、社会主义的力量正在经历反对帝国主义斗争的重要阶段
    决议说，目前国际局势的发展情况证明，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的结论是正确的。和平、民主、社会主义的力量现在正在经历反对帝国主义斗争中的重要阶段。在这个斗争中，它们已经取得了无可争辩的成就，并且获得了宝贵的经验，同时，促使国际紧张局势有了一定程度的缓和。但是，这种发展同帝国主义的侵略活动是相抵触的。帝国主义者不顾各国爱好和平人民的利益和愿望，企图通过英、法、以三国对埃及的侵略，通过在匈牙利进行反革命颠覆的阴谋，通过加强煽动人们反对社会主义国家、反对国际工人阶级运动和一切爱好和平力量的运动，来使这种发展趋势倒转过来。挫败帝国主义反对和平、反对社会主义阴谋的最可靠的保证，就是要坚持不渝地加强以苏联为首的社会主义国家之间的团结。
    捷苏之间已建立了平等合作的关系
    苏联政府在今年10月30日发表的关于社会主义国家之间的关系的宣言清楚地说明社会主义国家的团结是建立在无产阶级国际主义思想、权利平等、主权和不干涉内政的原则和最密切的经济、政治、文化合作的基础上的。在捷克斯洛伐克同苏联之间以及在捷克斯洛伐克共产党同苏联共产党之间，已经建立了这样一种关系。同样，我们也在列宁主义的原则上发展了我们同一切社会主义国家的关系。
    我们对资本主义国家所有共产党争取劳动人民权利、争取工人阶级团结和争取国际和平的英勇斗争表示热诚的同志的声援。我们对法国和意大利的兄弟共产党特别感到尊敬；它们在特别困难的条件下证明了它们的坚决意志，它们的团结，政治上的成熟，和对马克思列宁主义思想的忠诚。
    社会主义国家同取得民族解放斗争胜利的国家之间的合作显示了巨大力量
    目前，殖民地和附属国的民族解放运动已经有了很大的发展，整个帝国主义殖民体系在这一运动的打击下已经在加速瓦解。社会主义世界体系的国家同取得民族解放斗争胜利的国家之间的和平合作，特别是在帝国主义者背信弃义地进攻埃及，企图使它屈服的时候，更加突出地证明了自己的巨大力量。所有社会主义国家和全世界进步人民都同埃及人民站在一起反对帝国主义侵略。我们国家和我国人民也全力支持埃及驱逐英、法、以侵略者的正义努力，并且要求由他们承担全部责任，赔偿由他们所造成的巨大损失。
    完全支持苏联政府对匈牙利政府的军事援助
    决议说，我们全党、全体工人阶级和全体人民都以很大的注意力、怀着很大的不安密切注视匈牙利过去几星期的事件。在匈牙利进行的反革命颠覆的尝试，是帝国主义反对社会主义和进步的广泛阴谋的一个重要部分。我们党中央委员会完全同意和支持苏联政府的做法，苏联政府应匈牙利工农革命政府的请求给予军事援助，镇压反革命，保卫匈牙利的人民民主政权和恢复国内秩序。目前匈牙利局势的发展证明，苏联的这种做法是正确的，将来历史也会证明这一点。
    我们再一次表示，我们给匈牙利社会主义工人党和它的中央委员会以热情的、同志的声援。我们欢迎匈牙利工农革命政府为满足工人和全体劳动人民的正当要求而作的努力和坚决地保卫人民民主的成就的立场。我们深信，匈牙利工人阶级在坚持不懈地努力改正过去的一切缺点和错误当中，将很快地动员起它的全部力量，站在劳动人民的前列完成它的历史任务，保证社会主义匈牙利的建设。它在这种努力中将得到我国和其它社会主义国家以及共产党和工人党的经常的支持。
    严斥世界反动派对社会主义国家的挑衅运动
    决议说，我们严厉地谴责世界反动派对匈牙利人民共和国、苏联和各人民民主国家发动的挑衅运动。捷克斯洛伐克人民反对滥用联合国组织的讲坛干涉匈牙利的内政。
    决议接着说，波兰统一工人党中央委员会第八次全体会议在解决波兰国内的严重的政治和经济问题方面，发挥了重大的作用。我们重视波兰统一工人党领导机构的作法，它公开地指出了克服缺点、错误和困难以便挫败国际和国内的反动派所进行的一切阴谋的道路。我们衷心地欢迎波兰和苏联两国最近的莫斯科会谈中所取得的成果。
    铁托的演说有许多言论是不能使人同意的
    决议在谈到铁托同志在普拉就匈牙利国内的事件发表的演说时说，这篇演说除了就国际局势提出了一些正确的结论和估计以外，还包括另外一些言论，这些言论捷共中央一致认为是不正确的，而且是不符合国际共产主义运动的利益，不符合各国共产党和工人党的利益的。
    我们肯定不能同意根据某种“趋向”把各个共产党和它们的领导机构加以划分的那种作法。这显然是干涉这些党的内部事务。这种划分也对共产主义运动的国际团结有密切的影响，这种团结是共产主义运动在反对帝国主义者的进攻、维护劳动人民的利益、争取社会主义胜利的斗争中的力量和成就的重要的泉源。
    决议认为，铁托关于个人崇拜问题的提法也是不正确的。
    决议说，很显然，要把社会主义建设的某些特定的形式和趋向来作为对其他国家普遍有效的“典范”的任何努力，都是同列宁主义和工人阶级运动的国际经验相抵触的。
    创造性地运用各兄弟党建设社会主义的经验
    在我国的社会主义建设中，我们一贯地从对我们自己的情况和民族特点的马克思列宁主义的分析出发，同时我们总是记住自己的国际义务。
    同时，我们创造性地运用着苏联共产党在建设第一个社会主义国家的斗争中所积累起来的丰富经验。我们同时也仔细地吸收、并且还要进一步继续吸收和采用一切社会主义国家和兄弟党建设社会主义的经验。
    我们还要努力来不断加深和加强同南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的友好和同志关系，来客观地讨论和澄清对双方都很重要的一切问题。我们之间相互关系的基础，将永远是马克思列宁主义的教导和我们两国人民和整个国际共产主义运动的利益。
    劳动人民牢固团结保证了人民民主政权的巩固
    决议在谈到捷克斯洛伐克的国内问题时说，过去这些天，我们的工人阶级证明了它的政治上的成熟和阶级觉悟，证明了它对无产阶级国际主义思想的不可动摇的忠诚。和工人阶级一起，还有我们的农民和劳动知识分子也明确而坚决地表示赞同党和政府的政策，表示他们对加强人民民主祖国要作出更多的贡献的意愿。企业和农村中的主动性和劳动积极性的增长，社会主义竞赛的发展，新的统一农业合作社的建立——这就是对帝国主义破坏各国人民的和平、自由的阴谋所给予的回答。共产党又一次证明了它坚定不移地沿着正确的道路在领导我国全体人民前进。劳动人民的牢固团结不容许已被打倒的剥削阶级残余势力出来进行任何最微小的尝试，来损害我们的人民民主政权。
    同各国兄弟党的密切合作对争取和平和建设社会主义的斗争有决定性意义
    我们将进一步循着为各国人民的和平安全而进行坚决积极的斗争的道路前进，将始终不渝地实行基于社会主义和资本主义和平共处和和平竞赛的原则的列宁主义和平外交政策。我们将支持一切目的在于缓和国际紧张局势的努力和行动，同时要在这方面发挥最大的积极性。我们将坚决地进行反对帝国主义侵略势力的一切阴谋的斗争，将进一步引导我国人民对一切内外敌人提高警惕。
    我们将进一步以一切办法加强和发展我们同苏联的兄弟关系，巩固世界社会主义体系和发展社会主义国家相互间的政治、经济和文化关系。华沙条约是我们这些国家的坚强联盟的表现和它们的安全的保证，始终不渝地履行这个条约，这对我们的共同事业和和平事业是有益处的。
    同各国共产党和工人党维持密切合作和兄弟关系，对于我们争取和平和建设社会主义的斗争是有决定性重要意义的。同时，我们党同苏联共产党的原则性的团结比以往任何时候都更加重要。
    决议最后说，面对着最近的国际情势，我们将坚持不渝地执行我们的基本任务和我们的国内政策：进一步发展我国的经济力量和不断提高人民的生活水平。我们将不断地扩大我国的社会主义民主，让劳动人民更多地参加国家的领导和管理工作。党是我国人民争取和平和社会主义建设的斗争得到进一步胜利的保证，它的政策得到比以前更大的信任。我们将继续努力，以求进一步加深和加强这种信任。我们必须经常同最广大的劳动人民群众保持密切的联系。我们将在充满无产阶级国际主义和社会主义爱国主义思想的马克思列宁主义的旗帜下更加坚决地前进。
