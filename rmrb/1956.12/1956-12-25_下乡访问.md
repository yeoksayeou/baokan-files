    Visiting the Countryside
    Lü Xitian
    Local industry and handicrafts in Anyang City, through visits to the countryside, have implemented the policy of serving the rural economy and closely integrating with the agricultural economy.
    From last spring to the present, Anyang City has organized four city-wide visits to the countryside by local state-owned, joint state-private enterprises, and handicrafts. They visited nineteen counties, fifty districts, one hundred and fourteen townships, two hundred and eighty-seven villages, and twenty supply and marketing cooperatives, extensively exchanging opinions with farmers, township cadres, cooperative cadres, commercial workers, and rural handicraftsmen; and carried out product quality exhibitions on the spot with a variety of products, with more than 70,000 visitors. Various factories and handicraft industries also regularly or irregularly contacted the countryside to solicit opinions and hold customer symposiums. The Anyang Weaving and Dyeing Factory organized nine workers to go to the countryside with more than 40 kinds of products such as bed sheets and quilt covers to carry out business, which was very popular among farmers.
    Local industry and handicrafts, through visits to the countryside, understood the changes in rural economic development, the trends of the rural market, and the needs of the masses of farmers, enriched the content of local industrial and handicraft production, and broke the situation of closed-door production without regard to the market. In the past, private industrial and handicraft industries that processed for the state or received orders from the state believed: "The raw materials belong to the state, and the sales are handled by the company. We have no relationship with the countryside," and rarely studied market changes and rural needs. Many craftsmen relied only on their old brands and ancestral reputation, and did not improve product quality according to new situations and new changes. Therefore, many products that were originally welcomed by the masses were met with coldness. Wei's hoe blade is a typical example. In the past, Wei's hoe blade was known as "ancestral technology, an iron rice bowl", but after the implementation of close planting in rural areas and the participation of women in labor, narrower farm tools were required, but Wei's still produced hoe blades according to the old style—four inches wide and seven inches long. As a result, farmers did not buy them, and some agricultural cooperatives had hundreds of them stockpiled. After visiting the countryside and understanding the production needs of farmers, Wei's hoe blades were changed to two types, wide and narrow, polished to a mirror finish, and used good steel on the hoe blade, restoring their original reputation. After rural cooperativization, the number of radios increased, and the battery factory, based on this situation, trial-produced A and B combined air batteries, which were convenient to use and very popular. Since this spring, according to changes in rural areas, local state-owned and joint state-private industries have added seventeen new varieties, and handicraft cooperatives have added six hundred and one new products; many products have been reduced in price.
    Visits to the countryside have also promoted local industry and handicrafts to improve product quality and changed the phenomenon of past product backlogs. During the first quarter's visit to the countryside, the masses criticized the Golden Bell cigarettes for having paste on the cigarette sticks, sticking together, being uneven in length, uneven in hardness, and having a spicy and choking taste. The Golden Bell Cigarette Factory formulated an improvement plan based on these opinions, improved product quality, and satisfied the needs of the masses. The shoe factory originally believed that farmers made their own shoes and did not buy shoes, and only pursued the market in big cities, resulting in a backlog of 17,000 pairs of products. Later, after several visits to the countryside, they learned that a large number of women were working in the fields, and not only did many men buy shoes, but some women also bought shoes. In Dakun Village, Anyang, 400 households bought 450 pairs of shoes at once. Since then, the shoe factory has paid attention to improving the style and quality according to the requirements of farmers, and now it is not only not stockpiled, but also turned the off-season into a peak season. In late September, they held another customer symposium to solicit opinions. At the meeting, everyone raised ten opinions, some saying that the shoe style was not good and the shoe face was short; some saying that there were few styles for children to wear; and some saying that the shoe soles were not firmly sewn. After the meeting, they formulated measures to improve quality based on the opinions of customers, improved quality, and added new varieties.

    下乡访问
    吕锡田
    安阳市地方工业和手工业，通过下乡访问，贯彻执行了为农村经济服务、同农业经济密切结合的方针。
    去年春季到现在，安阳市组织了四次全市性的地方国营、公私合营企业和手工业下乡访问。去过十九个县、五十个区、一百一十四个乡镇、二百八十七个村、二十个供销社，广泛同农民、乡干部、合作社干部、商业工作者和农村手工业者交换了意见；并带着各种各样产品就地进行了产品质量展览，参观者达七万余人。各工厂和手工业行业，也经常定期或不定期地跟农村联系，征求意见，召开顾主座谈会。安阳织染厂组织了九个工人带着床单被面等四十多种产品下乡开展业务，很受农民欢迎。
    地方工业和手工业下乡访问，了解了农村经济发展的变化、农村市场的动向和农民群众的需要，充实了地方工业和手工业生产的内容，打破了不问市场关门生产的情况。从前，给国家加工或由国家订货的私营工业和手工业行业认为：“原料是国家的，销售是公司的，我们同农村没有关系”，很少研究市场变化和农村需要。不少手工业者只凭自己的老牌号、祖传名声吃饭，不根据新的情况新的变化来改进产品提高质量。因此，有许多原来受群众欢迎的产品遭到冷遇。魏家锄板就是个典型的例子。从前魏家锄板被誉为“祖传的技术，铁打的饭碗”，但是农村实行了密植，妇女参加了劳动，都要求窄的农具，魏家却还是按老样式——四寸宽、七寸长的锄板生产，于是农民不买了，有些农业合作社订了几百张也积压了起来。当下乡访问、了解了农民生产需要后，魏家锄板就改为宽、窄两种，磨得镜明瓦亮，并在锄刀上用了好钢，又恢复了原来的名声。农村合作化后，收音机增多，电池厂根据这种情况，试制了甲乙组合空气电池，用起来方便，很受欢迎。今春以来，根据农村变化情况，地方国营和公私合营工业增加了十七种新品种，手工业社增加六百零一种新产品；有不少产品降低了价格。
    下乡访问还推动了地方工业和手工业提高产品质量，改变了过去产品积压的现象。第一季度下乡访问时，群众批评金钟烟烟支上有浆子，互相粘在一起，长短不齐，软硬不匀，味辣，呛嗓子。金钟烟厂根据这些意见制定了改进方案，提高了产品质量，满足了群众的要求。鞋厂原来认为农民自己做鞋穿，不买鞋，只追求大城市的市场，结果积压产品一万七千双。后来数次下乡访问，了解到大量的妇女下地劳动，不仅很多男人买鞋穿，而且还有一些妇女也买鞋穿。安阳大韩村四百户人家，一次就买了四百五十双鞋。从此鞋厂就注意了根据农民要求来改进样式和质量，现在不仅不积压了，而且还把淡季变成了旺季。9月下旬，他们又召开了一次顾主座谈会，征求意见。会上大家提出十个意见，有的说鞋样不好，鞋脸短；有的说小孩穿的样子少；有的说鞋底纳的不牢实。会后他们根据顾主的意见，制定了提高质量的措施，提高了质量，增加了新品种。
