    In order to meet the growing needs of the Soviet people, the output of high-quality products in Soviet light industry has increased significantly this year. In the eleven months of this year, the production of silk fabrics has nearly doubled compared to the same period last year. The production of woolen fabrics, especially suit twill and overcoating, exceeded the original plan by more than 2 million meters. Due to the use of synthetic fibers and fancy yarns in production, the variety of silk fabrics has also increased. The production of plush, velvet, moiré, and gorgeous fabrics for women's evening wear has also been expanded.

    During this period, Soviet light industry also produced 2.3 billion rubles worth of ready-made clothes and 16 million pairs of shoes more than in the same period last year.

    适应人民日益增长的需要
    苏联今年轻工业产品增加很多
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：在今年头十一个月中，苏联轻工业企业比去年同时期多生产了价值九十多亿卢布的产品。
    为了适应苏联人民日益增长的需求，在今年苏联的轻工业产品中上等制品的产量增加得非常多。今年十一个月内，丝织品的生产比去年同期将近增加到一倍半。毛织品，特别是西装斜纹呢和大衣呢的生产超过原计划多生产了二百万公尺。由于在生产中采用了合成纤维和花色纱，丝织物的品种也增加了。长毛绒、天鹅绒、波纹绸和供妇女做晚装用的华丽的衣料的生产也已经扩大。
    在这个时间内，苏联轻工业还比去年同时期多生产了价值二十三亿卢布的成衣和一千六百万双鞋子。
    据新华社讯　苏联正在新建和改建约八十个大规模的纺织工业企业。在卡梅申、刻松、巴尔瑙尔、坎斯克等地，已经有一批巨型棉纺织联合工厂开始生产。在已经开始生产的全欧洲最大的卡梅申棉织联合工厂中，单是第一纺织厂每天就可以生产出约十六吨纱和八万公尺原色布。
