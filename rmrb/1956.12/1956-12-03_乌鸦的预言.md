　　The Raven's Prophecy
　　By Our Correspondent Hu Sisheng

　　On November 30th, Radio London, which has been increasingly concerned about the situation in Hungary, broadcasted that "The Budapest Party City Committee's Kish (Reporter's note: Comrade Kish is a member of the Provisional Central Executive Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party) has accepted an impossible task, asking him to reorganize the party, which is simply insane. The Communist Party has failed in Hungary and will never return." I have no interest in finding out the source of this news from Radio London, but it makes people feel that these gentlemen living across the English Channel seem to be too unaware to restrain themselves slightly.

　　Fortunately, I am a reporter in Budapest and can fully use objective facts to make some "supplements" to Radio London. The following are some of these "supplementary" materials:

　　On the afternoon of November 29th, the Provisional Executive Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party in the 13th District of Budapest held a meeting of party activists, attended by about 300 party activists. After Comrade Jiesi Janos, the leader of the district's Provisional Executive Committee, delivered a report on the party's work, a heated discussion ensued. An activist from the Ganz Shipyard said: "A provisional party committee has been established in the shipyard, as well as two primary organizations. We have refuted the idea that there should be no party organization in the factory. When our party was underground, we had a party organization in our factory. Now that the power is in the hands of the workers, how can there be no party in the factory?" Other comrades who spoke at the meeting expressed their support for the party's position and guaranteed to unite around the party as Communist Party members.

　　On November 30th, I interviewed some comrades in Budapest who were responsible for the party's construction work in various districts. Their conversations proved that the work of building the party in Budapest is gradually developing. Tabargani Latsiro, who is responsible for the party's construction work in the 7th District of Budapest, said: "On the first day of openly reorganizing the party in the 7th District, more than fifty organizations established party organizations. As of November 29th, 671 people have received party membership cards, most of whom were members of the former Hungarian Working People's Party, and many were members before 1945." Gelanman Bal, who is responsible for the party's construction work in the 18th, 19th, and 20th districts, said: "The 20th District is mainly a factory area. As of the evening of November 28th, twenty provisional party committees have been established throughout the district, mainly in factories." The conversation of Comrade Jiesi Terui, who is responsible for the party's construction work in the Csepel factory concentration area, further refuted the nonsense of Radio London. Comrade Jiesi Terui said: "In many factories, such as the steel factory, the steel pipe factory, and the 26th Construction Trust, provisional party committees have been established. It is estimated that by the end of next week, party organizations can be generally established in all factories in the Csepel district."

　　Of course, these comrades, when talking, did not underestimate the difficulties that have already been encountered and will be encountered in the party's construction work. Due to the sabotage by the socialist enemies through various methods, a complex struggle is unfolding in this politically decisive work. However, in any case, the socialist ideology of the Hungarian working class and patriots of all strata is the basic guarantee for achieving step-by-step progress on this front. Our view is that the task of reorganizing the Marxist-Leninist party in Hungary will be victoriously realized in overcoming numerous difficulties. If we talk about "insanity," in the bloody struggle to defeat the counter-revolutionary restoration, the advancing socialist cause of Hungary will make some Western groups who have placed huge bets in Hungary painfully "insane." The socialist cause of Hungary will not fail. Radio London's broadcast, like a raven making a prophecy, will gain nothing but self-deception.

　　乌鸦的预言
　　本报记者　胡思升
   11月30日，近来对匈牙利局势倍加关心的伦敦电台广播说：“布达佩斯党市委的基什（记者按：基什同志是匈牙利社会主义工人党临时中央执行委员会委员）接受了一个不可能实现的任务，叫他去重新组党，这简直是发狂了。共产党在匈牙利失败了，永远也回不来了”。我没有兴趣去打听伦敦电台的这项消息出自何源，来自何处，只是使人感觉到这住在英吉利海峡彼岸的先生们似乎太不知道略微管束一下自己了。
    幸而记者在布达佩斯，可以有充分的权利以客观的事实替伦敦电台作些“补充”。下面就是这些“补充”的一部分材料：
    11月29日下午，布达佩斯十三区匈牙利社会主义工人党临时执行委员会召开了党积极分子会议，大约有三百名党的积极分子出席了这个会议。在区的党临时执委会领导人吉西·扬诺士作了党的工作的报告后，展开了热烈的讨论。甘兹造船厂的积极分子说：“造船厂内已成立了党的临时委员会，还成立了两个基层组织，我们把所谓在工厂内不要党组织的说法打回去了。当我们党在地下时，我们工厂内就有党的组织，现在当政权掌握在工人手中的时候，工厂里怎么能没有党。”在会上发言的其他同志，都表现了支持党的立场，并保证以共产党员的资格团结在党的周围。
   11月30日，记者访问了在布达佩斯各区负责党的建设工作的一些同志，他们的谈话证明，布达佩斯建党的工作正在逐步地开展。负责布达佩斯第七区建党工作的塔巴尔加尼·拉其罗说：“在七区公开重新组织党的第一天，就有五十多个机关建立了党的组织。到11月29日为止，已有六百七十一个人拿到了党证，他们大部分是过去劳动人民党的党员，有不少在1945年以前就是党员。”负责第十八区、十九区和二十区建党工作的盖兰曼·巴尔说：
  “二十区主要是工厂区，到11月28日晚上为止，全区已经成立了二十个党的临时委员会，主要在工厂。”在切佩尔工厂集中区负责建党工作的吉西·台瑞同志的谈话，更驳倒了伦敦电台的一派胡言。吉西·台瑞同志说：“在不少工厂，如钢铁厂、钢管厂、二十六号建筑托辣斯都已建立了党的临时委员会，估计到下周周末，切佩尔区各个工厂都可以普遍建立党的组织。”
    当然，这些同志在谈话时，都没有低估在建党工作中已经遇到的和将要遇到的困难，由于社会主义敌人的多种方法的破坏，在这一带有决定意义的政治工作中展开着复杂的斗争，但是，无论如何，匈牙利工人阶级和各阶层爱国者的社会主义思想就是在这一条战线上取得一步步的进展的基本保证。我们的看法是：在匈牙利重新组织马克思列宁主义政党的任务将在克服重重困难中最后胜利地实现，如果谈到“发狂”的话，在击破反革命复辟的血肉斗争中，前进的匈牙利社会主义事业，将使那些在匈牙利压了巨大赌注的西方某些集团痛心得“发狂”。匈牙利的社会主义事业是不会失败的。伦敦电台的广播像乌鸦作预言一样，除了自欺欺人之外，是什么也捞不到的。
