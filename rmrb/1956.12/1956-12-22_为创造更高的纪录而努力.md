Strive to Create Higher Records
Dong Shouyi, Member of the International Olympic Committee, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Olympic Committee

Although Chinese athletes did not participate in the 16th Olympic Games due to the political conspiracy of certain individuals in the International Olympic Committee attempting to create "two Chinas," we paid attention to the achievements of athletes from various countries in the 16th Olympic Games. The 16th Olympic Games created nineteen world records, broke most of the Olympic Games records, and many champions were newcomers who have emerged in recent years, which was rare in past Olympic Games. In the four years from the 15th Olympic Games to the 16th Olympic Games, the world's athletic level has improved rapidly. The achievements reached by the athletes from various countries participating in this Olympic Games, whether track and field athletes, swimmers, or weightlifters, are quite considerable. Especially in track and field, the progress is even faster. For example, in the men's 100 meters, there are more than ten people with records between 10.2 and 10.4 seconds. There are also many people whose men's high jump exceeded the 2.04-meter result of the first place in the 15th Olympic Games. No less than seven or eight people can exceed Zatopek's championship result in Helsinki in the 10,000 meters. There are also five or six women who can throw the discus over 50 meters. Therefore, this Olympic Games changed the situation of the past Olympic Games where the levels of athletes participating in the same event varied greatly, and fierce competition appeared in the games. Anderssen, the American heavyweight weightlifter, who was known as the world's absolute champion, also encountered a strong and evenly matched opponent—Argentine athlete Silvetti.

The humid and rainy climate of Melbourne, Australia, had an adverse effect on athletes from many countries, especially European athletes. However, athletes from various countries still strived for good results, especially Soviet athletes, who achieved unparalleled achievements in this Olympic Games. Soviet athletes won more gold, silver, and bronze medals than any other country. The United States can no longer maintain its past dominant position in the Olympic Games. The achievements of Soviet athletes are inseparable from the Soviet Union's development of mass sports and attention to the comprehensive development of sports programs; it is also inseparable from the Soviet athletes' tenacious will and solid sports technical level.

The improvement of the sports technical level of our athletes is also not negligible. In a short span of six or seven years, China has widely developed sports activities, and many sports programs have reached or approached the international level. Judging from the results of the 16th Olympic Games, the result of 2 minutes and 36 seconds in the 200-meter breaststroke by Chinese swimmer Mu Xiangxiong was 0.7 seconds faster than the second place, Japanese Yoshimura, in this Olympic Games. Lin Jinzhu's record of 57.2 seconds in the 100-meter freestyle was the same as the fourth-place result in this Olympic Games. Shooter Zhang Hong's record in the rapid-fire pistol target reached 590 rings, while the record of the Romanian athlete Petrescu, who won the first place in this Olympic Games event, was 587 rings. The total score of the lightest weightlifter Chen Jingkai was 320 kilograms, which was the same as the fourth-place record in the same class in this Olympic Games, and his 137.5 kg snatch he created in Wuhan in November was not recorded in Melbourne. The total score of lightweight athlete Huang Qianghui was 367.5 kilograms, which was one kilogram more than the total score of Onuma, the fourth-place Japanese athlete in the same class in this Olympic Games. In track and field, the result of 50.93 meters by Chinese women's discus thrower Shi Baozhu exceeded the record of 48.20 meters by the fifth place in this Olympic Games; the records of pole vaulter Cai Yishu and long jumper Zhang Qishan were close to the sixth place in this Olympic Games.

Before liberation, the foundation of sports in China was very weak, and the achievements of athletes were only similar to those of the first and second Olympic Games in 1896 and 1900. Since the founding of New China, the sports technical level has improved so much, which is exciting. We believe that in the near future, there will be more athletes with higher levels.

However, we must never overestimate ourselves because of the rapid development of our sports technical level in recent years, which will cause complacency. Our athletes must continue to train hard and strive to improve their sports technical level, especially those athletes who have reached a certain level, should consider their achievements as just a beginning, and they still need to work hard, persevere in training, and strive to learn advanced technologies. In this way, in a few years, the sports performance will be greatly improved, and the technical level will be more consolidated. We must also pay attention to discovering and training more talented athletes and developing mass sports activities in order to create higher sports records on a broader basis.

    为创造更高的纪录而努力
    国际奥林匹克委员会委员  中国奥林匹克委员会副主席  董守义
    虽然中国运动员因国际奥林匹克委员会的某些人企图制造“两个中国”的政治阴谋而没有参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会，但我们对各国运动员在十六届奥林匹克运动会中获得的成就是给予关注的。第十六届奥林匹克运动会创造了十九个世界纪录，打破了绝大部分奥林匹克运动会纪录，许多冠军都是近年来涌现出来的新手，这在过去的奥林匹克运动会中是少见的。从第十五届奥林匹克运动会到第十六届奥林匹克运动会的四年里，世界的运动水平有了很快的提高。参加这届奥林匹克运动会的各国选手，无论是田径运动员、游泳运动员、或者是举重运动员，他们已经达到的成绩是相当可观的。特别是在田径运动方面，进步得更快，像男子一百公尺，纪录在十秒二到十秒四之间的有十余人；男子跳高超过第十五届奥林匹克运动会第一名二公尺零四公分成绩的人也很多；万公尺能超过查托皮克在赫尔辛基获得冠军成绩的不下七、八人。女子铁饼能掷过五十公尺的也有五、六人。因此，使得这届奥林匹克运动会改变了历届奥林匹克运动会参加同一项目比赛的运动员水平相差很远的情况，在比赛中出现了剧烈竞争的场面。号称为世界绝对冠军的美国重量级举重选手的安徒生，也遇到了强有力的、不分上下的敌手——阿根廷选手西尔维蒂。
    澳大利亚墨尔本潮湿多雨的气候，对许多国家的运动员，特别是对欧洲的运动员有不利的影响。但是，各国运动员还是努力争取了好的成绩，特别是苏联运动员，在这届奥林匹克运动会中获得了任何一个国家无可比拟的成就。苏联运动员获得的金质、银质和铜质奖章比任何一个国家都多。美国已保不住过去在奥林匹克运动会中鳌头独占的地位了。苏联运动员所获得的成就，是和苏联开展群众性的体育运动，注意运动项目的全面发展分不开的；也是和苏联运动员的顽强的意志以及巩固的运动技术水平分不开的。
    我国运动员运动技术水平的提高，也是不可漠视的。在短短的六、七年中间，我国已经广泛地开展了体育运动，而且，有不少个运动项目已经达到或接近了国际水平。从第十六届奥林匹克运动会的成绩来看，我国游泳选手穆祥雄的二百公尺蛙泳二分三十六秒的成绩，比这届奥林匹克运动会第二名日本吉村快了零点七秒；林锦珠的百公尺自由泳的五十七秒二的纪录同这届奥林匹克运动会的第四名成绩一样。射击运动员张鋐的手枪速射人像靶的纪录达到过五百九十环，而这次获得奥林匹克运动会这个项目第一名的罗马尼亚选手佩特雷斯库的纪录是五百八十七环。最轻量级举重运动员陈镜开的总成绩是三百二十公斤，与这届奥林匹克运动会同一级第四名的纪录相同，而他11月里在武汉创造的双手挺举的一百三十七点五公斤的成绩，在墨尔本却没有这个纪录。轻量级运动员黄强辉的总成绩是三百六十七点五公斤，比这届奥林匹克运动会同一级的第四名日本选手大沼的总成绩多一公斤。田径方面，我国的女子铁饼选手石宝珠的五十公尺九十三公分的成绩，超过了这届奥林匹克运动会第五名四十八公尺二十公分的纪录；撑竿跳高选手蔡艺墅和跳远选手张启山的纪录都接近这届奥林匹克运动会第六名。
    解放以前，我国体育运动的基础很薄弱，运动员的成绩仅仅和1896和1900年第一、二届奥林匹克运动会的成绩相仿。新中国成立以来，运动技术水平就有了这样的提高，这是不能不令人兴奋的。我们相信，在不久的将来，会出现更多的具有更高水平的运动员。
    但是，我们绝不能因为我国近几年来运动技术水平的突飞猛进，而过高地估计自己，这会引起自满。我们的运动员们必须继续刻苦锻炼，努力提高运动技术水平，特别是那些已经达到了一定水平的运动员，应当认为自己的成绩还只是开了一个头，还需要下苦功，坚持不懈地锻炼，努力学习先进的技术。这样，在几年以后，运动成绩一定会大大地提高，技术水平也一定会更加巩固。我们还必须注意发现和培养更多的有才能的运动员，发展群众性的体育运动，以便在更广泛的基础上，来创造更高的运动纪录。
