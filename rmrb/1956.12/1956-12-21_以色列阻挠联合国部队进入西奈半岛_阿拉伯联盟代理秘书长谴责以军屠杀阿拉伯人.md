Xinhua News Agency, December 20th—According to TASS, Cairo, December 19th: According to the "Al-Ahram" newspaper, Israeli forces have destroyed more than 900 kilometers of roads in the Sinai Peninsula and have laid mines on most of the roads. A batch of United Nations Emergency Forces that should have been stationed in the southern part of the Sinai Peninsula is still stranded in Saudi Arabia (three to four kilometers from Suez). The newspaper said that the Israeli forces in this area have only withdrawn forty kilometers from Suez.

The United Nations forces advancing along the Qantara-to-Al-Arish route were forced to stop after advancing sixty-three kilometers because Israeli forces also laid minefields during their retreat, blocking their path.

Xinhua News Agency, December 20th—Cairo News: Acting Secretary-General of the Arab League, Raif Brama, condemned Israel on the 19th for "killing two thousand one hundred and fifty Arabs in the Egyptian territory occupied by Israel." Brama said: "Israel killed one thousand four hundred Arabs in Khan Yunis in the Sinai Desert and seven hundred and fifty Arabs in Rafah in the Sinai Desert."

Brama said that these massacres have been reported to the United Nations, and Arab countries will be asked to support the formation of an international commission of inquiry to investigate Israeli crimes.

    以色列阻挠联合国部队进入西奈半岛
    阿拉伯联盟代理秘书长谴责以军屠杀阿拉伯人
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社开罗19日讯：据“金字塔报”报道，以色列军队在西奈半岛破坏了九百多公里道路，在大多数道路上都埋下了地雷。一批应当进驻西奈半岛南部的联合国紧急部队现在仍然只好停留在沙特（距苏伊士三、四公里）。这家报纸说，这一地区的以色列军队只从苏伊士后撤了四十公里。
    沿着坎塔拉到阿里希方向前进的联合国部队在前进了六十三公里以后就被迫停止前进，因为以色列军队在撤退时也设下了布雷区，阻住了他们的去路。
    新华社20日讯　开罗消息：阿拉伯联盟代理秘书长拉伊弗·巴拉马19日谴责以色列“在以色列占领的埃及领土上打死了二千一百五十名阿拉伯人”。巴拉马说：“以色列在西奈沙漠的汉尤尼斯打死了一千四百名阿拉伯人，在西奈沙漠的拉法打死了七百五十名阿拉伯人。”
    巴拉马说，已经把这些屠杀事件通知了联合国，同时将要求阿拉伯国家支持组成一个国际调查委员会来调查以色列的罪行。
