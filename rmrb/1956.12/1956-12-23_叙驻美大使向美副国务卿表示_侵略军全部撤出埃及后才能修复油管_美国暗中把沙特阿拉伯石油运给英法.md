Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: Washington Dispatch: Syrian Ambassador to the United States, Zeineddine, stated on the 21st that no work to repair the damaged Syrian oil pipeline can be carried out until British, French, and Israeli troops have completely withdrawn from Egypt.

Zeineddine made this statement to reporters on the 21st after meeting with US Deputy Secretary of State Hoover to discuss the repair of the Syrian oil pipeline. The United States has recently been requesting Syria to agree to the dispatch of American technicians to Syria to repair the pipeline which was damaged during the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt.

Zeineddine told reporters, "Blood is more important than spilled oil." He said that the withdrawal of the British, French, and Israeli troops from Egypt is "extremely important for thwarting any conspiracy to re-ignite or restore hostilities in the region." He said the withdrawal should include Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Zeineddine stated that he had conveyed this opinion to Hoover, and emphasized to Hoover that it is "necessary for Israel to return to the (1949) armistice line."

Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: TASS, Damascus, December 22nd: According to a "People's Voice" correspondent in Dhahran, news from Sayda says that the American oil company, which exploits oil in Saudi Arabia, is secretly shipping oil to Britain and France. It is known that the King of Saudi Arabia has prohibited the supply of Saudi Arabian oil to countries that have invaded Egypt.

Currently, 20 to 30 oil tankers enter the port of Sayda, which is connected to Saudi Arabia by pipeline, every day to transport oil. Before the invasion of Egypt, no more than three or four oil tankers arrived in Sayda daily.

    叙驻美大使向美副国务卿表示
    侵略军全部撤出埃及后才能修复油管
    美国暗中把沙特阿拉伯石油运给英法
    据新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：叙利亚驻美大使宰尼丁21日发表谈话说，只有英、法和以色列军队全部撤出埃及以后才能进行任何修复被破坏的叙利亚油管的工作。
    宰尼丁是在21日同美国副国务卿胡佛就修复叙利亚油管问题举行会谈以后向记者们这样表示的。美国最近一直在要求叙利亚答应由美国派遣技术人员到叙利亚去修复在英、法、以军队进攻埃及期间被破坏的油管。
    宰尼丁对记者们说：“流血要比石油流掉重要得多”。他说，英、法、以三国军队撤出埃及，“对于挫败使这个地区重新发生或者恢复敌对行动的任何阴谋是十分重要的”。他说，撤军应包括以色列撤出加沙地区。宰尼丁表示，他已经把这一意见转达给胡佛，并且向胡佛着重指出，以色列“有必要回到（1949年）停战线”。
    新华社22日讯　塔斯社大马士革22日讯：据“民声报”驻达兰记者报道，据赛伊达寄来的消息，在沙特阿拉伯开采石油的美国石油公司暗中把石油运往英国和法国。大家知道，沙特国王禁止把沙特阿拉伯的石油供给侵略埃及的国家。
    目前，每天有二十只到三十只油船驶进与沙特阿拉伯有油管相连的赛伊达港来运石油。在侵略埃及以前，每天到达赛伊达的油船不超过三、四艘。
