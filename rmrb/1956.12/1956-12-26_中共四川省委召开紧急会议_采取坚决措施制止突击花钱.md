Editor's Note: The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has taken decisive measures to stop the unhealthy trend of year-end spending sprees. This approach is very necessary. With only a few days left until the end of the year, those keen on spending sprees are seizing these last few days to quickly splurge. Our Party and state leadership organs must also seize these last few days, like the Sichuan Provincial Committee, to resolutely plug this loophole.

(Report from our newspaper) The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an emergency meeting of leading Party member cadres from provincial-level organs on the 23rd of this month, demanding the swift and resolute cessation of the year-end spending spree phenomenon.

Zhang Huchen, Party Secretary of the Provincial Department of Finance, revealed at the meeting the poor practices of the Provincial Departments of Industry, Transportation, and Agriculture in their year-end spending sprees. The Supply and Marketing Department of the Department of Industry colluded with several capital construction units to use surplus funds to stockpile materials for next year. The capital construction units prepaid, and the Supply and Marketing Department issued blank material allocation slips (though no such materials actually existed). The leaders of the Department of Industry even agreed to this fraudulent practice (which has since been corrected upon inspection). A section chief of the Department of Industry, at a symposium for the principals of the Chengdu Industrial School and the First Capital Construction School, not only failed to mobilize everyone to practice strict economy, but instead instructed them to hurry and spend the money. At the time, the Industrial School only had a surplus of 30,000 yuan, which was praised; the Capital Construction School had a surplus of 120,000 yuan and was criticized for spending too slowly. Afterwards, they tried to spend a lot of money that should not have been spent. The exploration team of the Bureau of Mines and Geology used surplus funds to purchase four cameras, five bicycles, one computer, and one jeep that were not included in the plan. The Highway Bureau of the Department of Transportation, with only over 6,000 road maintenance workers, ordered 10,400 raincoats using surplus road maintenance funds. The Department of Agriculture used surplus funds to buy a large number of rattan chairs, resulting in an average of two and a half rattan chairs per person, including the original ones. Some departments also instructed their subordinates not to use or to use as little as possible of their own funds and off-budget funds, and to try to use as much as possible of the surplus of state allocated funds. Many units sent people out to purchase items frantically. Some departments placed orders with handicraft production departments with deadlines extending to the end of 1958.

Yan Hongyan, Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, pointed out that after the Second Plenary Session was conveyed at the Provincial Party Committee's Second Enlarged Meeting and the campaign to increase production and practice economy was launched, the emergence of these unhealthy phenomena must be given serious attention. In order to resolutely stop the wasteful phenomenon of year-end spending sprees, he put forward the following specific measures: all prepayments and advance withdrawals should be recovered; funds for early material stockpiling without the approval of the Provincial Planning Commission should be recovered if possible, and those that cannot be recovered should be included in next year's capital construction budget; all materials that have been frantically purchased should be frozen and await handling; personnel sent by various departments to purchase non-urgent materials should immediately stop purchasing and be recalled to their offices; expenditures originally planned to be covered by off-budget funds should not be squeezed into the budget for reimbursement. Comrade Yan Hongyan requested leading Party member cadres of all departments to personally take charge of conducting a thorough inspection of the situation in their departments. All practices that violate the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy must be quickly corrected, and the problems that have occurred must be dealt with seriously, with light cases receiving criticism and education, and serious cases receiving disciplinary action. Yan Hongyan also suggested that the Provincial Department of Finance, the Department of Supervision, the Provincial Planning Commission, and the Provincial Supervisory Commission continue to strengthen their inspection and supervision of various departments.

    中共四川省委召开紧急会议
    采取坚决措施制止突击花钱
    编者按：四川省委对于年终突击花钱的歪风，采取坚决措施加以制止。这种作法十分必要。离年终只有几天了，那些热衷于突击花钱的人们正在抓紧这最后的几天赶快挥霍。我们党和国家的领导机关，也要抓紧这最后几天，像四川省委那样，坚决堵塞这个漏洞。
    本报讯　本月23日，中共四川省委召开省级机关党员负责干部紧急会议，要求迅速坚决制止年终赶花钱的现象。
    财政厅党组书记张呼晨在会上揭发了工业厅、交通厅、农业厅等部门突击花钱的不良现象。工业厅供销处和若干基建单位串通动用结余经费，为明年备料，基建单位预付价款，供销处则开给空头拨料单（实际并无这些料），工业厅领导上竟也同意了这种弄虚作假的作法（经检查已纠正）。工业厅有关科长在成都工业学校及第一基建学校校长座谈会上，不仅不动员大家厉行节约，反而布置赶花钱。当时工业学校经费只结余三万元，受到表扬；基建学校结余十二万元，被批评花得迟缓。会后他们就想办法赶花了许多不该花的钱。矿冶局勘探队用结余经费购买未列入计划的照像机四部、自行车五辆、计算机一部、吉普车一辆。交通厅公路局只有养路工人六千多人，竟用养路费结余订购来雨衣一万零四百件。农业厅用结余经费大买藤椅，连原有藤椅每人平均用二把半。还有些部门指示所属，不用或少用本单位自有资金和账外资金，尽量多用国家拨款的结余部分。许多单位派人四出抢购。有的部门向手工业生产部门的订货，期限竟远至1958年底。
    四川省委书记处书记阎红彦指出，在省委二次扩大会议传达了二中全会精神，布置了开展增产节约运动以后，还出现这些不良现象，必须引起严重注意。为了坚决制止年终乱花钱的浪费现象，他提出以下几项具体措施：不应预付预提的款，一律收回；未经省计划委员会批准即提前备料的款，能收回则收回，不能收回者列入明年基建预算；已抢购的物资，一律冻结，听候处理；各部门派出购买不急需物资的人员，立即停止采购，召回机关；原计划在账外资金中开支的不得挤入计划内报销。阎红彦同志要求各部门党员负责干部，亲自负责对本部门情况认真作一次检查。一切违背增产节约精神的作法，要迅速纠正，已发生的问题必须严肃处理，轻者批评教育，重者纪律处分。阎红彦并且建议省财政厅、监察厅、省计划委员会和省监察委员会继续加强对各部门的检查和监督。　（四川日报财经组）
