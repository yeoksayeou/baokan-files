　　Bidault's "Regret"
    French Foreign Minister Pineau publicly stated in the French Senate on November 27th that the French government felt "regret" for the "premature cessation" of the war of aggression against Egypt, because "we did not achieve all the goals we set for ourselves. We once wanted to occupy the entire canal..."
    Of course, Bidault's admission that the invaders did not achieve "all the goals they set for themselves" is somewhat more candid than that of his invading partners across the Channel, who claim to have already achieved their goals. But Bidault's forgetfulness and arrogance are indeed surprising.
    Judging from his "regret," it seems that he has forgotten under what circumstances he was forced to "stop." Just over twenty days ago, the invaders' troops encountered unexpectedly strong resistance in Port Said; the anger of the world—including the anger of the people of Britain and France—was crashing like a tide against the British and French governments; the thunderous anti-aggression forces pointed at the noses of the invaders and issued serious warnings. At that time, Bidault and his ilk were aware of what they were facing, and therefore held emergency cabinet meetings in a panic in the middle of the night, rushing to agree to stop. Now, not much time has passed, yet Bidault and his ilk have become arrogant again, only remembering their aggressive "goals" and forgetting the disaster this "goal" brought upon them.
    Bidault not only forgets the past, but even forgets the present—forgetting the oil shortage on the streets of Paris and the economic disasters France is facing. According to these reckless arsonists, they seem to have to send themselves and the entire country into the grave before they don't feel "regret."

### 比诺的“遗憾”

　　比诺的“遗憾”
    法国外交部长比诺11月27日在法国参议院公开说：法国政府对于侵埃战争“过早的停止”感到“遗憾”，因为“我们没有达到我们给自己规定的一切目的。我们曾经想占领整个运河……”
    当然，比诺承认侵略者没有达到“给自己规定的一切目的”，这比起海峡对岸那些自称已经达到目的的侵略伙伴来，可以说是较坦白些。但比诺的健忘和狂妄，却的确使人吃惊。
    照他的“遗憾”来看，好像他已经忘记了自己是在什么情况之下被迫“停止”的。二十多天之前，侵略者的军队在塞得港遭遇了完全出乎他们意想之外的坚强抵抗；全世界的愤怒——包括英法两国人民的愤怒，像潮水似地冲击着英法政府；雷霆万钧的反侵略力量指着侵略者的鼻子提出了严重的警告。那时，比诺之流是意识到自己面临什么的，因而惊惶万状地半夜三更开紧急内阁会议，赶急答应住手。现在，日子过去并不久，然而比诺之流就又嚣张起来，只记得自己的侵略“目的”，而不记得这个“目的”对于自己的灾难了。
    比诺不但忘记过去，甚至也忘记现在——忘记巴黎街上的石油荒和法国所面临的经济灾难。照这些不惜冒险的玩火者看来，他们似乎是要把自己和整个国家送进了坟墓才不感到“遗憾”的。
