Xinhua News Agency, Zhanjiang, December 27th. Nearly four thousand workers from the Zhanjiang Port Authority and construction departments, along with people from all walks of life in Zhanjiang City, gathered today to celebrate the state's official early use of Zhanjiang Port. The entire crew of the Polish ocean-going vessel "Dąbrowskiego," which had just entered the port and docked, also participated in the celebration, warmly welcomed by their hosts.

The state has expedited the construction and early use of Zhanjiang Port based on the needs of international trade and domestic material exchange. This port began trial operations in May of this year when the deep-water wharf was completed. The trial operation has been effective for several months, with ships safely entering and leaving, and cargo loading and unloading efficiency increasing month by month. Ninety-eight domestic and foreign ships have entered and left this port, including seven ocean-going ten-thousand-ton ships from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden, and ten Chinese and Vietnamese ships sailing on the China-Vietnam route. These ships berthed at the newly built deep-water wharf and loaded and unloaded more than 250,000 tons of goods.

Now that Zhanjiang Port has been officially approved for early use by the Ministry of Communications, the unfinished port construction project will continue. As of the beginning of this month, the first phase of the port's main project has been completed.

Zhanjiang Port is a natural deep-water, ice-free port located on the Leizhou Peninsula, the southernmost part of mainland China. It is the shortest port on the route from Europe and Southeast Asia to mainland China.

    国家提前使用湛江港
    新华社湛江27日电　今天，湛江港务管理部门和筑港部门的职工，以及湛江市各界人民近四千人集会庆祝国家正式提前使用湛江港。刚好进港靠岸的波兰籍远洋万吨轮船“邓博夫斯基”号的全体船员，在主人们热烈欢迎下，也参加了这个庆祝大会。
    国家是根据国际贸易及国内物资交流的需要而加紧建设和提前使用湛江港的。这个港口在今年5月份筑成深水码头的时候，就开始试用了。试用几个月以来，效果良好，轮船安全地进进出出，货物装卸效率也逐月提高。国内外轮船进出这个港口的已经有九十八艘次，其中有波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和瑞典的远洋万吨轮船七艘次，航行于中越航线的中国轮船和越南轮船十艘次。这些船舶靠泊在新建成的深水码头，装卸了二十五万多吨物资。
    湛江港现在经交通部验收批准提前正式使用以后，还将继续进行未完成的筑港工程。到本月上旬为止，这个港的第一期主要工程已经完成了。
    湛江港在中国大陆最南的雷州半岛，是一个天然深水不冻港。它是从欧洲和东南亚到中国大陆来的航线最短的港口。
