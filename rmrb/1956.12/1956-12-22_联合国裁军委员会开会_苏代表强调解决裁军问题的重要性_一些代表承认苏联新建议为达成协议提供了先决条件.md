Xinhua News Agency, December 21st, New York Dispatch: The United Nations Disarmament Commission met on the 20th to discuss the Commission's report to the General Assembly and the Security Council. This meeting was convened at the request of the Soviet representative in a letter dated December 1 this year.

The Commission adopted a draft report recommending that the minutes of the Commission's meetings and all documents relating to disarmament be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council.

The first speaker at the meeting was Soviet Representative Sobolev. He said that half the session of the Eleventh United Nations General Assembly had passed, and that it would soon be adjourned. Continuing to delay the submission of the Commission's report could put the UN member states in a difficult position, and they have every right to express their views on the issue of disarmament.

Sobolev emphasized the urgent importance of the disarmament issue. He reviewed the Soviet government's proposals of November 17 on the issue of disarmament and easing international tensions, pointing out that the United Nations General Assembly should discuss this proposal with due attention, and that the Disarmament Commission has a responsibility to enable the General Assembly to begin discussing the disarmament issue immediately. He also expressed his agreement with the Commission's draft report.

Some representatives of the Commission acknowledged that the Soviet Union's new proposals have provided some preconditions for reaching an agreement on the disarmament issue.

U.S. Representative Lodge welcomed the new Soviet proposals, arguing that the proposals showed that on the issue of disarmament "the Soviet Union is willing to approach the U.S. position." Lodge said, "The United States has noted recent indications that the Soviet Union is willing to consider aerial inspection as a positive factor in disarmament, and therefore feels that there is some hope." However, he once again said that the United States requires a disarmament agreement with "effective supervision, soundness, and guarantees."

Yugoslav Representative Brilej pointed out that there is now a real possibility of resolving the disarmament issue. Brilej said that his delegation believes that the recent Soviet proposals are of particular importance.

    联合国裁军委员会开会
    苏代表强调解决裁军问题的重要性
    一些代表承认苏联新建议为达成协议提供了先决条件
    新华社21日讯　纽约消息：联合国裁军委员会20日开会讨论委员会对大会和安全理事会的报告。这次会议是应苏联代表在今年12月1日信中所提出的要求而召开的。
    委员会通过了报告草案，草案建议把委员会的会议记录和有关裁军问题的一切文件提交联合国大会和安全理事会。
    会上第一个发言的是苏联代表索波列夫。他说，联合国大会第十一届会议的会期已经过去了一半，而且现在很快又要休会了。继续拖延提出委员会的报告可能使联合国会员国处于困难的境地，而它们是有充分权利来表示自己对裁军问题的看法的。
    索波列夫强调指出裁军问题的迫切重要性。他追述了苏联政府11月17日关于裁军和缓和国际紧张局势问题的建议，指出联合国大会应当以应有的注意来讨论这个建议，并且指出裁军委员会有责任使大会立即开始讨论裁军问题。他还表示同意委员会的报告草案。
    委员会的一些代表们承认苏联的新建议已经为裁军问题达成协议提供了一些先决条件。
    美国代表洛奇表示欢迎苏联的新建议，他认为，这个建议表明在裁军问题上“苏联愿意接近美国的立场”。洛奇说：“美国注意到最近表明苏联愿意考虑把空中视察作为裁军的一个积极因素的迹象，因此觉得有了某些希望。”不过他又一次说，美国要求达成一个具有“有效监督的、健全的、有保证的”裁军协议。
    南斯拉夫代表布里列伊指出，目前有解决裁军问题的真正可能。布里列伊说，他的代表团认为苏联最近的建议有特别重要的意义。
