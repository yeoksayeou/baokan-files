Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, December 23rd: Premier Zhou Enlai continued talks with Prime Minister Suhrawardy at 5 p.m. on December 22nd.

    That morning, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long travelled by car to visit the Sindh Industrial Area, located seven miles outside of Karachi. This industrial area, covering 4,000 acres, has over two hundred factories of varying sizes, in an area that was previously barren land before Pakistan's independence. Pakistan now possesses approximately 1.8 million spindles and over 21,000 looms, whereas in 1947 it only had 177,000 spindles and over 5,000 looms. The Chinese Premier and his entourage visited a wool mill, a cotton mill, and a biscuit factory. As the Chinese guests entered each workshop, the workers presented Premier Zhou Enlai with flower garlands and raised their hands, shouting "Welcome!" and "Long Live Sino-Pakistan Friendship!" Factory management presented the Chinese guests with woolen goods and biscuits.

    Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long also visited the Pakistani Navy that morning. They traveled by boat to Manora Island near Karachi, where they reviewed the cadets of the naval training school. Afterwards, they returned by boat, and sailors and naval officers standing on the decks of warships in the harbor waved their hats to welcome the passing guests. The Chinese guests had lunch at the Pakistani Naval Headquarters with Prime Minister Suhrawardy, Foreign Minister Noon, and Pakistani Naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Choudhri.

    That afternoon, they watched an impressive equestrian performance by the six cavalry guards of the Presidential Palace.

    中巴两国总理继续举行会谈
    周总理、贺副总理访巴工业区和海军
    据新华社卡拉奇23日电　周恩来总理22日下午5时继续同苏拉瓦底总理进行会谈。
    当天上午，周恩来总理和贺龙副总理乘汽车到卡拉奇郊外七英里的信德工业区参观。这个面积达四千英亩的工业区有二百多个大小工厂，而在巴基斯坦独立以前，那里是一片荒地。巴基斯坦现在拥有大约一百八十万枚纺锭和二万一千多台织布机，而在1947年只有十七万七千枚纺锭和五千多台织布机。中国总理和随行人员参观了毛织厂、棉织厂和饼干工厂。当中国客人们进入各车间参观的时候，工人纷纷向周恩来总理献花环，并举手高呼“欢迎”、“巴中友好万岁”。工厂管理人员把毛织品和饼干赠送给中国客人。
    周恩来总理和贺龙副总理还在这天上午访问了巴基斯坦海军。他们乘船前往卡拉奇附近的马诺拉岛，在那里检阅了海军训练学校的学员。然后他们乘船回来，站在港内军舰甲板上的水兵和海军军官向经过的客人挥动帽子表示欢迎。中国客人在巴基斯坦海军总部同苏拉瓦底总理和外交部长努恩和巴基斯坦海军总司令乔德里海军上将共进午餐。
    这天下午，他们观看了总统府六个骑兵卫队的出色的骑术表演。
