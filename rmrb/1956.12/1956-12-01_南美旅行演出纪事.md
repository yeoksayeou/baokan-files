A Record of a Performance Tour in South America
　　Li Shaochun
　　I received the assignment to go to South America for a performance tour in late July. At that time, I had just returned from a visit and performance tour in Japan with the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe led by Mr. Mei Lanfang. The warm welcome of the Peking Opera by the Japanese audience and the infinite friendship of the Japanese people towards China were still deeply imprinted in my mind. At that time, I thought: South America is separated from our country by more than tens of thousands of miles, and there has been little contact in the past. It is also the first time they see Peking Opera; we probably won't meet kindred spirits everywhere like we did in Japan, and the South American people may not be as enthusiastic as our close neighbors and friends.
　　With these thoughts, I departed from Beijing with the art troupe in early August, flying through Mongolia, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and Dakar on the west coast of Africa, crossing the Atlantic Ocean to South America. After living on this other side of the Earth for only a few days, especially after the premiere, I realized that my original thoughts were wrong. Although the South American people are not familiar with China's traditional culture and art, their enthusiasm and interest in learning about it are very high. Although most South Americans and we are meeting for the first time, they expressed infinitely warm and deep friendship to their Chinese friends.
　　Whether it was in Chile, a narrow country famous for producing nitrate and copper, or in Uruguay, known as the "Switzerland of South America," whether it was in Brazil, a large country in Latin America, or in Argentina, known as the "Land of Abundance for Agriculture and Animal Husbandry," people responded to the art troupe's performances with long-lasting applause, repeatedly shouting "Bravo!" (good!) and "Bueno!" (good!) to express their appreciation.
　　South American colleagues are particularly interested in the unique characteristics of Chinese classical drama in terms of its form and content. They call Chinese Peking Opera "the all-round drama," and are very surprised that Peking Opera can naturally melt music, dance, poetry, mime, and martial arts into one, believing that "this is a goal that the West is pursuing but has not yet reached."
　　The costumes, props, and actors' makeup of Chinese Peking Opera also attract South American audiences. Every day before and after the performance, many people come backstage to visit. Some sit in the actors' dressing room for half a day, carefully observing from beginning to end how the actors "transform themselves" into the appearance of Dan (female roles) or Jing (painted-face male roles) on the stage. Friends in the South American art world highly appreciate the costumes of Chinese Peking Opera, saying that it is a grand combination of silk, brilliance, and color, a "truly wonderful and indescribable magnificence," and therefore "simply a visual feast for the viewers." Zhao Feng, the deputy head of the art troupe, once presented a set of Xiaosheng's (young male role) pleated gown, thick-soled boots, and flower gauze hat to the leader of the National Cervantes Comedy Theater in Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina, at a "Chinese Art" report meeting. He was so happy that he immediately put them on on the spot.
　　The South American public feels fresh and likes the music of Chinese Peking Opera. South American musicians often come backstage to visit Chinese musical instruments, and every time they have to knock and play them a few times. They especially admire the Huqin, and are very surprised that this "Chinese violin" is not played horizontally but vertically; the posture of playing the instrument is so free and easy, yet the musical melody played is so beautiful.
　　People are also very interested in the martial arts of Peking Opera. They happily talked about the fighting in "Havoc in Heaven" and the water battle in "Yandang Mountain," saying that they are "full of inspiring vitality and liveliness, joy, and unfold like a whirlwind." The critics affirmed that this "whirlwind" has rules and organization that cannot be deviated from in the slightest, otherwise it would be impossible to express the amazing scene of action rhythm and time being completely consistent.
　　Although South American friends cannot fully understand our recitations and arias due to language barriers, they still have a good understanding of the content. I remember once in Chile, Mr. Benstrot, the backstage director of the Santiago Municipal Theater, ran over excitedly to shake hands with us after watching "Havoc in Heaven," saying that the play gave him a lot of feelings, "The mood of the Chilean people is exactly the mood of Sun Wukong." Maria Rosa Oliver, a famous Argentine female writer, also asked me with great interest: "Is Sun Wukong's character expressed from the perspective of a monkey or a human?"
　　South American actors are interested in the lives of Chinese artists. In Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, an artist said to me more than once: "Chinese actors are happy!" I didn't pay much attention to this at the time, but after contacting the actual lives of some actor friends, I realized how meaningful it was. When we were in Buenos Aires, we visited the "Home of Theater Workers" in Argentina. This is a welfare institution that is entirely supported by donations and charity performance income from Argentine artists, providing some retired actors with a place to spend their old age for free, and the government does not provide any subsidies to it. There, we saw dozens of old artists with gray hair. They dedicated most of their lives to the stage, and now they have lost their ability to work, and their lives are poor and desolate. When we went to express our condolences, they hugged and shook hands with us for a long time. An old lady in her seventies who was sick held the art troupe's publication we gave her tightly in her arms, tears welling up in her eyes. This scene left a deep impression on me, reminding me of an old saying often said in the Peking Opera circle in our country in the past: "Old age is pitiful, and the aftermath is desolate." Today, such encounters have disappeared in our country. Here, I would like to particularly mention the spirit of unity, mutual assistance, and solidarity among Argentine artists. Their own lives are not very affluent, but they are willing and happy to help colleagues in need. In order to make high-quality classical and modern dramas widely available to the audience, many progressive directors and actors organized "experimental theaters" (selling tickets cheaply) to conduct semi-voluntary performances for a long time. Their love and loyalty to art cannot but be admired.
　　During our performances, we were often invited by friends in the local art world to visit and enjoy their performances. Among all the operas, ballets, folk art programs, and movies I watched, I especially liked a Chilean ballet called "The Green Table." It depicts how a group of warmongers snatch their relatives from the arms of kind mothers, wives, and lovers to be used as cannon fodder in order to make money from war. In the end, the war ends, and the families of the sacrificed soldiers together denounce the war profiteers for their blood debt and demand the return of their relatives. Such a theme is relatively easy to make very conceptual, but it is handled delicately and movingly. The combination of music, dance, and performance is also very good, and can arouse emotional resonance from the audience.
　　Through joint research on art and mutual observation, we quickly made friends with South American artists. Everyone laughed and talked to their hearts' content, and longed to know more about each other. In just over two months, our soloists learned to sing popular South American folk songs in Spanish and Portuguese; Chinese flute players were also able to freely use instruments from Bolivia and northern Argentina to play the local melancholy and melodious folk tunes.
　　During the art troupe's performance in Buenos Aires, the actors of the ballet troupe of the Colon Theater came to watch us practice every day. They were very interested in the basic movements of Peking Opera martial arts. Some male actors followed us to practice somersaults, twists, flying kicks, somersaults... etc., and soon learned how to do "Cuan Mao". Young friends from the ballet troupe also learned red ribbon dances from our dancers. They often spun a red ribbon while jumping and performing, sweating profusely. In order to teach their Chinese counterparts Argentine dances, they took advantage of their rest time to organize a continuous program of more than 40 minutes, allowing Chinese friends to choose which ones to learn. Every evening, the theater's rehearsal hall was filled with an atmosphere of friendly teaching.
　　On the day of our last performance at the Colon Theater, the actors of the ballet troupe pooled their money to buy flower baskets to send us off, and many people were so sad to say goodbye that they shed tears. We deeply felt this feeling of reluctance every time we left a country. I remember in Santiago, at the farewell reception held by the art troupe, a playwright said goodbye to me four times and then turned back. Professor Libschitz, a world-renowned Chilean scientist in his seventies, repeatedly said that Chinese art had restored his youth. He warmly embraced and kissed us, wanting to say goodbye like a "father to a son."
　　In fact, it is not just the art world, but people in hotels, shops, schools, institutions, and even people we met by chance on the road, all expressed great friendship to Chinese artists. When they met, they always waved and smiled at you, or unexpectedly took out a notebook to ask you to sign; some even secretly stuffed a small local product in your hand, asking to keep it as a souvenir.... The deep affection of South American friends for Chinese guests is endless.
　　The art troupe's performance tour in South America has ended for almost a month, but the enthusiasm of South American friends still feels warm. I would like to deeply bless them here, bless the lovely South American people with peace and happiness, and bless our respectable colleagues with greater achievements in art.

### 南美旅行演出纪事

　　南美旅行演出纪事
　　李少春
    我接受到南美洲去作旅行演出的任务是在7月下旬。那时我刚随梅兰芳先生率领的中国京剧团从日本访问演出归来。日本观众对京剧的热烈欢迎和日本人民对中国的无限友好还深深地印在我的脑中。当时我想：南美和我国相隔何止万里，过去相互联系很少，又是初次看京剧；我们大概不会像在日本那样处处遇见知音，南美人民也可能不如近邻朋友那样热烈。
    怀着这样的想法，8月初我随艺术团从北京出发，飞经蒙古、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞士等国和非洲西海岸的达喀尔，横渡大西洋到了南美洲。在这地球另一边的土地上生活了仅仅几天，特别是开始公演以后，我就发现自己原先的想法错了。虽然南美人民对中国传统的文化艺术并不熟悉，但他们要求了解的热情和兴趣很高。尽管南美人和我们大都是初次相逢，他们向中国朋友表达了无限热烈和深厚的友谊。
    不论是在以出产硝石和铜著名于世界的狭长之国智利或是被称为“南美的瑞士”的乌拉圭，不论是在拉丁美洲的泱泱大国巴西或是号称“农牧天府”的阿根廷；人们都用经久不息的掌声答谢艺术团的演出，连连的喊着“布拉浮”（好！）和“布爱诺”（好！）来表示自己的赞赏。
    南美的同行们对中国古典戏剧特别感到兴趣的是它在形式上和内容上所独具的特点。他们称中国京剧为“全能的戏剧”，非常惊讶京剧能把音乐、舞蹈、诗歌、哑剧、武打自然地熔于一炉，认为“这是西方正在追求而还未达到的目标”。
      中国京剧的服装、道具和演员的化妆，同样吸引着南美的观众。每天演出前后，都有许多人来后台参观。有的在演员化妆室里一坐就是半天，从头到尾地仔细观察演员们怎么“摇身一变”而成舞台上的旦角或是净角的模样。南美美术界的朋友对中国京剧的服装评价很高，说它是丝绸、光采和颜色的大组合，是“真正美妙和不可形容的富丽”，因此“对于看的人简直是一种视力欣赏的会餐”。艺术团赵风副团长有一次在阿根廷首都布宜诺斯艾利斯举行的“中国艺术”报告会上，送了一套小生的花褶子、厚底靴和花罗帽给当地国立塞万提斯喜剧院的领导人，他高兴得马上当场穿戴起来。
    对于中国京剧的音乐，南美公众感到新鲜和喜欢。南美的音乐家常到后台来参观中国乐器，每回都要敲敲打打试它几下。他们特别赞赏胡琴，很奇怪这种“中国的提琴”不横着拉而竖着拉；操琴的姿势何等自在、洒脱，奏出来的音乐旋律却又那么优美。
    人们对京剧的武打也非常有兴趣。他们快活地谈论着“闹天宫”里的对打和“雁荡山”的水战，说它们“充满了令人奋发的生气和活泼、愉快，展开的时候像旋风一般”。评论界肯定这种“旋风”有着丝毫不能相差的规律和组织，否则就无法表现动作节奏和时间完全一致的惊人场面。
    尽管由于语言不通，南美朋友不能全部了解我们的念白和唱词，但他们对于内容还是很有体会的。记得有一次在智利，圣地亚哥市立剧院的后台主任本斯脱先生看完“闹天宫”后激动地跑来和我们拉手，说这戏使他感触很多，“智利人民的心情正是孙悟空的心情”。阿根廷著名的女作家玛利亚·罗莎·奥立佛也曾饶有兴味地问起过我：“是从猴的角度还是人的角度来表现孙悟空的性格的？”
    南美的演员们对中国艺术家的生活感到兴趣。在乌拉圭的首都蒙得维的亚，有一位艺术家曾经不止一次地对我说：“中国演员是幸福的！”我当时对这话并没有格外在意，但在接触了一些演员朋友的实际生活以后，才感到它是多么的意味深长。在布宜诺斯艾利斯的时候，我们去访问过阿根廷“戏剧工作者之家”。这是完全依靠阿根廷的艺术家的捐助和义演收入来维持的一个福利机构，免费供给一些退休了的演员度过他们的晚年，政府对它没有任何补助。那里，我们见到了几十位头发斑白的老艺术家。他们在舞台上献出了自己的大半辈子，现在丧失了劳动能力，生活清苦而凄凉。当我们去慰问的时候，他们久久地和我们拥抱、拉手。有一位七十多岁正在病中的老太太把我们送她的艺术团团刊紧紧地抱在胸前，激动得泪花直在眼眶里打转。这情景给我的印象很深，它使人想起我国京剧界早先常说的一句老话：“老境堪怜、身后萧条”。今天，这样的遭遇在我们国家已经一去不返了。这里我想特别提一下阿根廷艺术家们团结互助、同舟共济的精神。他们本身的生活并不十分宽裕，但是却勇于和乐于帮助有困难的同行。为了使有水平的古典和现代戏剧广泛地和观众见面，许多进步的导演和演员组织了“实验剧院”（票价卖得便宜）长期进行半义务性的演出。他们热爱和忠实于艺术的精神不能不让人感到钦佩。
    我们在演出之余也常被当地艺术界的朋友邀去作客和欣赏他们的演出。在所有看过的许多歌剧、芭蕾舞剧、民间艺术节目和电影里，我特别喜欢的是一出名叫“绿桌子”的智利芭蕾舞剧。它描写一群好战分子如何为了发战争财而从善良的母亲、妻子和情人的怀里夺去她们的亲人充当炮灰。最后战争结束，牺牲了的士兵家属一起向战争贩子声讨血债、要还亲人。这样的主题本来较容易搞得很概念化，但却被处理得细致和动人。音乐、舞蹈和表演结合得也很好，能够引起观众感情上的共鸣。
    通过对艺术的共同研究和互相观摩，我们同南美的艺术家很快就交上了朋友。大家尽情地欢笑，谈论，彼此渴望了解得更多。在短短的两个多月里，我们的独唱家学会了用西班牙和葡萄牙语演唱南美流行的民歌；中国的笛子吹奏家也能自如地用玻利维亚和阿根廷北部的乐器吹奏出当地那些幽怨和婉转的民间曲调。
    艺术团在布宜诺斯艾利斯演出期间，哥伦剧院芭蕾舞剧团的演员每天都来看我们练功。他们对京剧武功的基本动作很感兴趣，一些男演员跟着我们练习翻筋斗、拧旋子、打飞脚、鹞子翻身……等等，不久就学会了窜毛。芭蕾舞剧团的青年朋友还跟我们的舞蹈演员学红绸舞。时常抡着一条红绸连跳带耍、满头大汗，为了教会中国同行阿根廷舞蹈，他们利用休息时间一口气组织了四十多分钟的连续节目，让中国朋友挑选学习那些种。每天傍晚，剧院的排练大厅里都充满了友爱的教学气氛。
    我们在哥伦剧院举行最后一场演出的那天，芭蕾舞剧团的演员自己凑钱买了花篮来相送，许多人因为惜别而难过得掉下泪来。这种依依不舍之情，我们在每离一个国家的时候都深有感受。记得在圣地亚哥，艺术团举行的告别酒会上，有一位戏剧家向我告辞了四次又转回来。智利享有世界声誉的科学家、七十多岁的李卜西茨老教授再三地说中国的艺术使他恢复了青春。他热烈地拥抱和亲吻我们，要像“父亲对儿子式的”道别。
    事实上不只是艺术界，在旅馆、商店、学校、机关，甚至路上偶然遇到的人们，都对中国艺术家表示十分友好。见了面总要和你招手、笑笑，或是出其不意地掏出小本来请你签名；有的更悄悄地塞一件小土产在你手里，要求留作纪念……。南美朋友对于中国客人的深情是说不尽的。
    艺术团在南美的旅行演出已经结束将近一个月了，但南美朋友的热情还让人感到温暖。我愿在这里深深地祝福他们，祝福可爱的南美人民和平、幸福，祝福我们可敬的同行在艺术上获得更高的成就。
