Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 20th: Sea mullet fry that live in seawater can also be raised in freshwater.

In mid-November, the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Aquatic Products transferred 2,100 mullet fry to Guanting Reservoir for stocking. Recent observations indicate that these fish are thriving in freshwater. This batch of fish had been raised in harbors with a salinity of 4% to 6% for a considerable period.

In the past, most of the fish fry in Tianjin's aquatic farms were transported from the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. Because of the long distance, transportation was difficult and consumed a lot of manpower and material resources. The fact that sea mullet fry can be raised in freshwater will help the development of the aquaculture industry in this coastal city. The Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Aquatic Products has already planned to release another 7 million fry in freshwater next year.

    海里的梭鱼苗在官厅水库里生活得很好
    新华社天津20日电　生活在海水里的梭鱼苗，也能够在淡水里放养。
    上月中旬，天津市水产局把二千一百尾梭鱼苗，移到官厅水库里放养，据最近的观察，这些鱼在淡水里生活得很好。这批鱼曾经在含盐分4％到6％的水港里放养过一个较长的时期。
    以往天津各水产养殖场的鱼苗，大部分是在长江中游运来的，因为路远，运输困难，耗费人力物力很大。海产梭鱼苗能够在淡水里放养，将有助于这个沿海城市水产养殖事业的发展，天津市水产局已经计划明年再在淡水里放养七百万尾。
