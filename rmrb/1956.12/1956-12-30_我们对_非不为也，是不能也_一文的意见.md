    Our Opinion on the Article "It's Not That They Don't Want To, It's That They Can't"
    The CPC Zigong Municipal Committee, Sichuan Province
    On July 5th, the People's Daily published an article on its fourth page written by Comrade Ai Feng, entitled "It's Not That They Don't Want To, It's That They Can't," which criticized our Zigong Municipal First Party Congress. We believe that this is a major event in the Party life of Zigong City. We immediately convened a meeting of the Municipal Party Committee Standing Committee that evening to study it, and then held three consecutive plenary meetings of the Municipal Party Committee for discussion. Recently, we also held an enlarged meeting of the Municipal Party Committee to comprehensively review the preparation and convening of the First Party Congress of Zigong City.
    We believe that the First Party Congress of Zigong City did have shortcomings, and some of these shortcomings were quite serious, and there were even individual errors. It is appropriate for the newspaper to criticize these shortcomings and errors. However, we feel that the criticism made by the People's Daily in the article "It's Not That They Don't Want To, It's That They Can't" is not comprehensive enough.
    What shortcomings and errors did the First Party Congress of Zigong City actually have?
    First, in the notice issued by the previous Municipal Party Committee before the meeting, when pointing out the issues that should be paid attention to in the speeches, it only generally stated that "the content of the speeches should be based on the spirit of the Party Central Committee on opposing right-leaning conservatism, realizing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and in accordance with the work report of the Municipal Party Committee, combined with the situation of the department, examine the existing problems and shortcomings in the work; examine collective leadership and democratic style, and put forward suggestions for improvement," but it did not clearly point out that the speeches should first criticize the shortcomings and errors in the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, which made some representatives feel apprehensive. Although the previous Municipal Party Committee made corrections after discovering this situation, this could not but affect the full development of criticism and self-criticism at the congress.
    Second, the deliberation of the candidates for the Municipal Party Committee members was not sufficient, especially when some representatives raised objections to four candidates, the presidium, although it studied the matter, did not completely appropriately believe that these shortcomings still belonged to general ideological style issues and that it was still appropriate not to replace them; and it did not spend more time deliberating, but held a vote too early. This is an important manifestation of the insufficient development of democracy in the meeting. At the same time, the congress did not adopt the method of passing the list of candidates one by one according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, but adopted the erroneous method of passing the list of candidates all at once. This is also a violation of the principles of democratic life within the Party.
    Third, the Zigong Municipal Party Committee's work report did not sufficiently examine and criticize its own bureaucratic style, especially the subjective reasons for the formation of this bureaucratic style, which to a certain extent affected the full development of criticism and self-criticism at the meeting.
    We believe that although the First Party Congress of Zigong City had the above shortcomings, democracy was promoted regardless of the preparation for the meeting and the process of the meeting, and the meeting was basically successful. This is mainly manifested in the following aspects:
    First, the draft report of the Municipal Party Committee to the Party Congress was distributed to the branches before the meeting, and all Party members were organized to discuss it. Later, the Municipal Party Committee held three Municipal Party Committee meetings based on the 255 criticisms and constructive suggestions put forward in the discussion, and revised the report four times, before it became the official document for reporting to the congress. During the congress, in group discussions and speeches at the congress, the representatives raised 593 criticisms and suggestions on the report, and the presidium made some revisions to the report based on the opinions of the representatives. This proves that neither the previous Municipal Party Committee nor the presidium of the congress was like what the article said, "neither willing to 'broaden avenues of speech' and humbly listen to criticism from below, nor willing to set an example and conduct profound self-criticism"; nor was it like what the article said, guiding the representatives to "repeat some examples in the report."
    Second, the secretariat issued a total of four issues of the "Congress Briefing" during the congress. After the first day of speeches at the congress, the general reaction of the representatives was: three representatives criticized the leadership work of the Municipal Party Committee, which everyone felt satisfied with. Other representatives' speeches lacked criticism from the bottom up, and some representatives' speeches were not profound enough, which everyone had opinions on. These opinions of the representatives were fully reflected in the third issue of the briefing. This proves that what the article said, "many representatives pointed out that the atmosphere of criticism from the bottom up at the meeting was too poor... the presidium not only did not support the correct opinions of the representatives, but on the contrary... criticized many representatives who did not conduct profound self-examination, by name and surname" is also not in line with the actual situation.
    Third, the proposal and deliberation of the list of delegates to the First Party Congress of Sichuan Province and the candidates for the Municipal Party Committee members were also relatively serious and prudent. This list was proposed after the previous Municipal Party Committee studied it twice. Then, the previous Municipal Party Committee sent the resumes of the candidates for the Provincial Party Congress and the resumes and appraisal materials of the original twelve Municipal Party Committee members to each branch for all Party members to discuss. The ten newly proposed candidates for the Municipal Party Committee members were only discussed at the enlarged meeting of the district and factory Party committees attended by the branch secretaries because there was not enough time. In the discussion, everyone believed that four candidates needed to be replaced. The previous Municipal Party Committee studied these opinions and believed that they were correct. At the meeting of the heads of the congress delegations on the eve of the opening of the congress, these four candidates were replaced. Only then was the draft list of candidates suggested to the presidium of the congress officially determined. In the discussion, even though it was a small number of representatives who raised objections to the four candidates, the presidium also studied these opinions and continued to deliberate among the representatives, but the deliberation was not sufficient. Due to time constraints, the election was conducted even though a small number of representatives insisted on disagreeing with those four candidates. The facts prove that it was not like what the article said: "only a simple resume was issued," "the presidium regarded the list of candidates it proposed as sacred and inviolable, and did not listen to everyone's opinions at all," "using the excuse that time was up, it deprived the representatives of the right to speak and discuss."
    From the title of the article "It's Not That They Don't Want To, It's That They Can't" and the entire content of the article, it seems that the Zigong Municipal Party Congress was a failure and that democracy was suppressed. Obviously, this is not in line with the actual situation of the preparation and progress of the congress.

    Editor's Note: The criticism of the First Congress of the CPC Zigong Municipal Committee in the article "It's Not That They Don't Want To, It's That They Can't" on page 4 of this newspaper on July 5 has been reviewed based on the information and opinions provided by the author's letter and the inspection report of the CPC Zigong Municipal Committee. We believe that this report is indeed largely one-sided. Not only did the report fail to affirm some of the achievements of the congress, but also some of the criticisms of the shortcomings were exaggerated. The occurrence of this error is due to the fact that the author Comrade Ai Feng's understanding of the preparation and progress of this meeting was not comprehensive enough, and this newspaper should bear the main responsibility for the editing and processing of this manuscript. For example, although the author's original report criticized the shortcomings of the meeting in the main part, it also used a certain amount of space to affirm the achievements of the meeting, but the part that affirmed the achievements was deleted by the editor of this newspaper. Furthermore, there were several places in the article where the wording was too dogmatic, which were the result of the editor of this newspaper's revision. The phrase "It's Not That They Don't Want To, It's That They Can't" in the article was also added by the editor, and this sentence was used as the title of the article. Moreover, the author's opinion was not sought after such a major modification of the article, which was tantamount to imposing the editorial department's opinion on the author, showing a lack of due respect for the author. The editorial department will accept this lesson and improve the editing and processing of critical manuscripts.

### 我们对“非不为也，是不能也”一文的意见

    我们对“非不为也，是不能也”一文的意见
    中共四川省自贡市委员会
    7月5日，人民日报第四版刊登了艾风同志写的题为“非不为也，是不能也”的文章，对我们自贡市第一次党代表大会提出了批评。我们认为这是自贡市党的生活中的一个重大事件，当晚即召开了市委常委会议作了研究，以后又连续召开了三次市委全体会议作了讨论，最近还召开了市委扩大会议，全面地检查了自贡市第一次党代表大会准备和召开情况。
    我们认为自贡市第一次党代表大会确实存在着缺点，有些缺点是相当严重的，甚至还有个别错误。报纸对这些缺点和错误提出批评是应当的。但我们感到人民日报在“非不为也，是不能也”一文中提出的批评是不够全面的。
    自贡市第一次党代表大会究竟存在着哪些缺点和错误呢？
    第一，前届市委在会前发出的通知中，在指出发言应该注意的问题时，只一般地提出了“发言内容应本着党中央关于反对右倾保守，提前实现五年计划和开展批评和自我批评的精神，根据市委的工作报告，结合本部门情况，检查工作中存在的问题与缺点；检查集体领导，民主作风，并提出改进意见”等，却没有明确指出发言首先应该对市委领导中的缺点和错误提出批评，因而使有的代表就产生了顾虑，虽然前届市委在发现这一情况后，作过纠正，但这已经不能不影响到在大会上充分开展批评和自我批评。
    第二，大会对市委委员候选人的酝酿是不充分的，特别是部分代表对四个候选人提出不同意他们作候选人的意见时，主席团虽然作了研究，但不完全妥当地认为这些缺点还是属于一般的思想作风问题，仍以不更换为宜；而且没有拿出更多的时间进行酝酿，就过早地举行了投票表决。这是会议发扬民主不够的重要表现。同时大会选举中没有按照省委的指示采取逐个通过候选人名单的办法，而采取了错误的一次通过候选人名单的办法。这也是违背党内民主生活的原则的。
    第三，自贡市委工作报告中对自己的官僚主义作风检查和批判不够，特别是对形成这种官僚主义作风的主观原因检查和批判不够，这就在一定程度上影响了会议批评和自我批评的充分开展。
    我们认为，自贡市第一次党代表大会虽然存在着以上缺点，但不论会议的准备和会议的进行过程，还是发扬了民主的，会议基本上还是开得成功的。这主要表现在以下几个方面：
    第一，市委向党代表大会的报告草案，会前曾发到支部，组织全体党员进行了讨论。以后，市委又根据讨论中提出的二百五十五条批评和建设性的意见，召开过三次市委会议，对报告作了四次修改，才成为向大会作报告的正式文件。代表大会期间，在小组讨论和大会发言中，代表们又对报告提出了五百九十三条批评和建议，主席团根据代表们的意见对报告作了一些修改。这证明，不管是前届市委，不管是大会主席团并不像文章中所说的“既不愿‘广开言路’虚心听取下面的批评，又不愿以身作则进行深刻的自我批评”；也不像文章中所说的，引导代表们去“重复报告上的一些事例”。
    第二，大会期间，秘书处一共出了四期“大会简报”，第一天大会发言后，代表们的普遍反映是：有三位代表对市委领导工作提出了批评，大家感到满意，其他代表发言缺乏自下而上的批评，少数代表发言不深刻，大家有意见。第三期简报上把代表们这些意见全面地反映出来了。这证明文章中所说的“许多代表提出会议自下而上批评的空气太差了……主席团不仅没有支持代表的正确意见，相反……却对不少自我检查不深刻的代表，指名指姓地提出了批评”也是不符合实际情况的。
    第三，出席四川省第一次党代表大会的代表和市委委员候选人名单的提出和酝酿也是比较认真和慎重的。这个名单是经前届市委分别作过两次研究后提出的。接着前届市委又把省党代表大会代表候选人的履历表和原有十二个市委委员的履历表以及鉴定材料发到各个支部让全体党员讨论。新提出的十个市委委员候选人，因时间来不及，只在有支部书记参加的区、厂党委扩大会上进行了讨论。在讨论中，大家认为有四个候选人需要更换，前届市委研究了这些意见，认为是正确的，大会开幕前夕的大会代表团长会议上，更换了这四个候选人。才正式确定了向大会主席团建议的候选人名单草案。在讨论中，尽管是少数代表对四个候选人提出了不同意的意见，主席团也对这些意见作了研究，并继续在代表中间作了酝酿，不过酝酿得不够充分，由于时间关系，就在少数代表坚持不同意那四个候选人的情况下进行了选举。事实证明并不像文章所说的那样：“只发了一张简单的履历表”，“主席团却把自己提出的候选人名单看得神圣不可侵犯，根本不听取大家的意见”，“借口时间已到，剥夺了代表们发言和讨论的权利”。
    而从文章的题目“非不为也，是不能也”和文章的整个内容看，好像自贡市党代表大会开的是失败的，是压制了民主的。显然，这是和大会的准备以及进行的实际情况不符合的。
    编者按　本报7月5日第四版“非不为也，是不能也”一文对中共自贡市第一次代表大会的批评，我们根据作者来信提供的情况和意见，根据中共自贡市委的检查报告作了检查，认为这一报道确有较大的片面性，报道中不但对这次会议的一些成绩没有肯定，就是对缺点的批评也有一些地方是夸大的。这一错误的发生，除过作者艾风同志对这次会议的准备和进行了解得还不很全面而外，本报对这一稿件的编辑和处理要负主要责任。比如，作者原来的报道虽然以主要篇幅批评了这次会议的缺点，但也用一定篇幅肯定了这次会议的成绩，可是肯定成绩的部分却被本报编辑删掉了。再比如，文中有几处在文字上过于武断的地方，都是本报编辑修改的结果，文中的“非不为也，是不能也”也是编者加上的，并用这句话作了文章的标题。而且，文章作了如此重大的修改之后，也没有征求作者的意见，等于把编辑部的意见强加于作者，表现了对作者缺乏应有的尊重。编辑部将接受这一教训，改善对批评稿件的编辑和处理工作。
