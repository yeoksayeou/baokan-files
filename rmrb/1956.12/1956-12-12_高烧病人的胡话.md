Ramblings of a Patient with a High Fever
　　Hú Zicháng
    Recently, I have come into contact with some patients suffering from high fevers and have heard many delirious ravings. I have recorded them and offer them to brilliant doctors for reference in treating and saving people, hoping to receive prescriptions that address the symptoms.

    The "Pay According to Labor" Advocate

    With the wage adjustment, even if I don't say anything, I'll still get my share. However, I cannot help but care about whether my name will be on that "individual promotion" upgrade list in the future.

    I am a cadre of the state, and I never care about high or low wages, high or low status. However, in order to support the state's policies and to prevent deviations in the implementation of policies within our organization, I must offer my opinions. To offer opinions, I must give concrete examples, and using my own situation as an example is naturally the most appropriate.

    Needless to say, I have suffered grievances for many years. If I don't speak up, our leaders won't know, and even the masses lack understanding of me. Otherwise, why am I not included in the list of active workers, and why can't I run in the election of advanced producers?

    Wage adjustments are different from those empty titles of active worker and advanced worker; they are related to my actual life, my health, my family, my work enthusiasm, and everything I have. I cannot allow others to control me; I must strive for this righteous struggle and will not give up until I achieve victory.

    Of course, I will never make unreasonable demands. So, promote me five grades! Five grades won't do? Four grades. Four grades won't do? Then three grades! If a three-grade promotion still doesn't work, that means someone is deliberately making things difficult for me. Whoever makes things difficult for me, I will make things difficult for them. If you oppose my promotion by three grades, I will oppose even your promotion by half a grade. Let's all compromise and all get promoted by three or five grades. Wouldn't that be "everyone happy"? If our production enthusiasm is raised, the state won't be wasting money even if it spends a little more!

    Don't say I'm being "wishful thinking." Actually, if I really don't get promoted by a few grades, it's no big deal. I was able to live before, so what can't I live through in the future? At the very least, after a general adjustment, I can switch from Elephant brand cigarettes to Front Gate brand cigarettes, and I can switch from eating Class B dishes to Class A dishes in the cafeteria. However, what I fear is causing losses to the country's work. Because aren't adjustments and promotions supposed to be in accordance with the socialist principle of "pay according to labor"? If I am adjusted too little and not promoted, then I will have to "pay according to labor." If you say work three jobs a day, I say work one job in three days; if you say the pay is high and the labor is little, I say the pay is little and the labor is much; since it is not piecework, slowing down the work will come naturally, and what can you do to me!

    The Tempest Over an Overturned Ink Bottle

    You say that overturning a bottle of ink is a small matter? Do you know that this ink is public property!

    Yes, you admit it was "carelessness." However, carelessness is only a phenomenon, not the essence. You must elevate it to the level of "principle" in order to discover what the essence is.

    "Not cherishing public property" is a step forward, but it is still not enough. If you see someone else overturn a bottle of ink and do not try to salvage it, that is called "not cherishing"; but you, yourself, overturned the bottle of ink, so it is not just "not cherishing," you are "damaging public property," do you understand?

    Can't you dig deeper? Good, I'll give you a hint. Think about it, is "damaging public property" in contradiction with the spirit of the Constitution?

    You now understand that this is something that goes against the spirit of the Constitution. But how could you, as a worker of the working class, do something that goes against the spirit of the Constitution?

    "Out of inadvertence"? You're going back to what you said before. I just prompted you to think deeply and look at the problem from the level of "principle," but instead you are lowering it. Then you will never be able to recognize your mistakes. If you can't recognize your mistakes, how can you overcome them? I ask you, you actually did something that goes against the spirit of the Constitution. Isn't that sabotaging the Constitution?

    Don't be silent. This is an undeniable fact. Alright, with this fact, I will help you "elevate" one step further. I ask you, what kind of people sabotage the Constitution? You should understand, overturning a bottle of public ink shows how seriously bad the essence of your thinking is!

    高烧病人的胡话
  　胡子长
    近来接触了一些正发着高烧的病人，听到许多谵言呓语，记录下来，谨供高明的大夫在治病救人时参考，希望能得到对症下药的处方。
    “按酬付劳”论者
    工资调整，我就是不言语，也少不了我那一份。可是，我不能不关心那“个别提高”的升级名单之中，将来有我没我。
    我是国家的干部，工资多，工资少，地位高，地位低，我是从不计较的。只不过，为了拥护国家政策，为了不使我们机关中在执行政策的时候发生偏差，我就得提意见。提意见必须举具体的例子，用我自己的事实做例子，自然是顶恰当不过的了。
    不用说，多少年来我是受尽了委屈的。我不说，我们领导上是不会知道的，甚而群众对我也欠缺了解的。要不，为什么积极工作者的名单中既不把我列入，先进生产者的选举中我又不能竞选呢？
    调整工资可跟积极工作者、先进工作者那些虚名不一样，它关系我实际的生活，关系我的健康，关系我的家庭，关系我的工作热情，关系我所有的一切。我就不能听任别人摆布，我得为我这个正义的斗争而努力，不获胜利，誓不甘休。
    当然，我也决不作非分的要求。这样，把我提升五级吧！五级不行？四级。四级不行？那就三级吧！提升三级，再要不行，那是存心跟我为难。谁跟我为难，我也跟谁过不去。你反对我升三级，我连你升半级也反对。大家伙凑合凑合，全升个三级、五级，岂不“皆大欢喜”？咱们生产热情提高了，国家多花点钱也不叫浪费呀！
    别说我这是“一厢情愿”，其实，真的不给我升几级，那也没什么，以前我能活，往后我有什么不能活的？至少，经过一般的调整，我可以从大象牌改抽前门牌香烟，可以在食堂里从乙级菜改吃甲级菜。不过，我就怕的是给国家带来工作中的损失。因为，调整和升级，不是说为了符合社会主义“按劳取酬”的原则吗？把我调整得少了，不把我升级，那我就得“按酬付劳”啦。你说一天干三个活，我说三天干一个活；你说酬多劳少，我说酬少劳多；既非按件计值，磨洋工不学自会，你又奈我何哉！
    打翻墨水瓶的风波
    你说打翻了一瓶墨水是小事吗？你知不知道，这墨水是公家的呀！
    对，你承认是“粗枝大叶”。但是，粗枝大叶只是一种现象，还不是本质。你应该提高到“原则”上，才能发现什么是本质。
    “不爱护公共财产”，这话是进了一步，可还是不够。你如果瞧见别人打翻了墨水瓶，没有去抢救，那叫做“不爱护”；你，自己打翻了墨水瓶，就不仅仅是“不爱护”啦，你这叫做“破坏公共财产”，知道吗？
    你不能再从深处挖掘了吗？好，我启发你一句。你想想看，“破坏公共财产”，和宪法的精神是不是矛盾呢？
    你现在才明白，这是和宪法精神相违背的事。可是，你，作为一个工人阶级的工人，怎么做出了与宪法精神相违背的事情来呢？
    “出于无意”？你这又说了回去了。我才启发你往深处想，提高到“原则”上看问题，你这反而降低了，那就一辈子也不能认识自己的错误啦。不能认识错误，又怎么能克服错误呢？我问你，和宪法精神相违背的事，你竟然做出来了，你这是不是破坏宪法呢？
    你别不言语，这是无可抵赖的事实。好了，有这个事实，我再帮助你“提高”一步，我问你，什么人才破坏宪法呢？你该明白了吧，打翻了一瓶公家的墨水，说明你思想的本质是多么严重的恶劣哩！
