Xinhua News Agency, December 4th dispatch from Washington: The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 3rd, welcoming the decision of Britain and France to withdraw their troops.

The statement also revealed the great interest of the United States in replacing the British and French aggressor troops with UN forces.

The statement, approved by Eisenhower and Dulles, said that the withdrawal of British and French troops and their replacement with UN forces would "strengthen the UN's ability to handle other aspects of the unresolved Middle East issues."

"Under the United Nations Charter, the United Nations has a responsibility to resolve the underlying causes of international friction and conflicts of interest." "In fulfilling this obligation, the United States will continue to fully support measures necessary to enable the UN forces to accomplish this purpose." "Secretary-General Hammarskjöld can count on the unlimited cooperation of the United States."

The statement advocated for the work of clearing the canal to be carried out "immediately" while Britain and France have not yet implemented their decision to withdraw troops, and said that "arrangements must be made without delay" to ensure the management of the canal in accordance with the six principles adopted by the Security Council.

　　公然主张在英法撤军前立即“清理”运河
    新华社4日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院在3日发表声明，欢迎英法两国撤军的决定。
    声明同时表明了美国对于以联合国部队代替英法侵略军的巨大兴趣。
    这项经过艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯批准的声明说，英法撤退军队和代之以联合国部队将会“增强联合国处理尚未了结的中东问题其他方面的能力”。
      “根据联合国宪章，联合国有责任解决国际间的磨擦和利害冲突的基本根源”。“美国在履行这个义务时将继续充分支持为使联合国部队能够完成这个目的而需要采取的措施”。“哈马舍尔德秘书长能够指靠美国的无限制的合作”。
    声明主张当英法两国还没有执行它们的撤军决定的时候就“立即”进行清理运河的工作，并且说“必须毫不延迟地作出安排”，根据安理会通过的六项原则来保证运河的管理。”
