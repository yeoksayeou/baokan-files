Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 9th: Fifty-four People's Representatives and CPPCC members in Wuhan formed seventeen groups to conduct two inspections of the work of seventeen bureaus of the government and many grassroots units between October and November. The focus of the inspections was to see whether government agencies had seriously handled the more than 1,200 opinions and proposals put forward by the representatives at the Fourth Session of the First Wuhan Municipal People's Congress. The results of the inspections confirmed that most government agencies had seriously handled the representatives' opinions, ensuring that every case was settled and every item was accounted for, and many long-standing problems were also resolved. In the past, citizens had to buy rice of different qualities at different times and places for the same price. Based on the opinions put forward by the representatives, the Grain Bureau instructed each rice mill to strictly inspect the finished products before they left the factory. At the same time, rice samples of the same quality were placed in each grain store so that citizens could identify the standards when buying rice, avoiding the phenomenon of grain stores using inferior rice to deceive residents. After the pedicabs were organized, pedestrians had to go to the pedicab station to take a ride, which was very inconvenient for the elderly, the disabled, and pregnant women. The Transportation Bureau also took corresponding measures for this opinion put forward by the representatives, so that pedicabs provided convenient mid-way rides for the above-mentioned passengers. Some government officials also went deep into the grassroots to conduct investigations and research during the handling of proposals, so that the problems could be handled reasonably and quickly. After the director of the Labor Bureau personally went to the Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau and other units to conduct investigations, he proposed the issue of transferring temporary workers to permanent workers. In accordance with the labor policy, more than 180 migrant workers from the Han River Diversion Project of the First Engineering Department of the Municipal Construction Bureau and more than 1,900 temporary workers from the Yangtze River Bridge were transferred to permanent workers.
	During these two inspections, the representatives adopted the method of combining "listening above with seeing below." During the inspection, the representatives listened to the reports of the directors of each bureau on the handling of the proposals, and then the heads of the bureaus accompanied the representatives to the field to verify the situation. Therefore, this inspection not only played a role in promoting the work of the government, but also sounded an alarm for the bureaucratic work style of some agency leaders. Yuan Wen, the director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, handed over 20 opinions from the People's Congress meeting to his subordinates for handling a month ago. When reporting to the representatives, he said that all the problems had been solved. Later, during the field inspection with the representatives, he found that none of the opinions had been handled. At this time, he personally went deep into the streets, contacted the actual situation, and then concentrated on research before solving 66 of the 72 opinions.

　　武汉市多数政府机关认真处理人民代表意见
　　件件有交代　案案有着落
　　人民代表和政协委员的视察给官僚主义敲起了警钟
    新华社武汉9日电　武汉市有五十四位人民代表和政协委员组成十七个组，分别在10月到11月间对政府十七个局和许多基层单位的工作，进行了两次视察。视察的重点是看一看政府机关是否认真处理了市第一届人民代表大会第四次会议上代表提出的一千二百多条意见和提案。视察的结果证实，多数政府机关对代表意见都分别地进行了认真的处理，作到了案案有着落，件件有交代，许多长期存在的问题也得到了解决。过去，市民用同样的价钱，在不同时间、不同地点要买质量不同的米的问题，粮食局根据代表们提出的意见，责成各米厂严格成品出厂检验工作，同时还把同一品样的装米的瓶子放在各粮店里，以便市民买米时有识别标准，避免了粮店以次米充好米使居民吃亏的现象。三轮车组织起来后，行人要到三轮车站才能乘车，老人、残废人和孕妇等很感不便。交通运输局对代表们提出的这个意见也采取了相应的办法，使三轮车对上述乘车人给予中途乘车的方便。有些政府机关负责人在处理提案过程中，还深入到基层进行调查研究工作，使问题处理得既合理又迅速。劳动局局长亲自到长江大桥工程局等单位作调查后，提出临时工转正式工问题，按照劳动政策把市建设局第一工程处汉江分洪的一百八十多名民工和长江大桥一千九百多名临时工都转为正式工人。
    这两次视察，代表们采取了“在上面听，到下面看”相结合的办法。代表们在视察时分别听了各局长处理提案的汇报后，再由局的负责人陪同代表到实地查证。所以，这次视察工作不仅对政府工作起了推动作用，而且还对某些机关负责人的官僚主义作风敲了一次警钟。民政局长袁文在一个来月前把人民代表大会会议所提意见中二十条交给下面去办理。在向代表汇报时，他说问题都解决了。后来他同代表在实地视察中发现一条意见也没处理。这时他才亲自深入街道，接触实际，然后再集中研究，才把七十二条意见解决了六十六条。
