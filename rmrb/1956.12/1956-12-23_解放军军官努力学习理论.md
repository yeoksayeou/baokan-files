Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: Since March of this year, the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and its subordinate units have established more than 1,100 primary and secondary-level theory night schools and more than 200 primary and secondary-level cadre theory training courses, attracting a large number of officers to study theory. At the same time, a large number of senior officers have adopted the method of self-study while off-duty, earnestly studying political economics and philosophy. Up to now, most units' intermediate classes have completed the capitalist part of political economics, and most primary classes have completed the course on basic knowledge of social sciences.

The PLA officers have a serious attitude towards learning and achieve excellent results. Officers stationed on the front lines of the Xiamen Island area in Fujian, often persist in studying under the harassment of Chiang Kai-shek's troops' artillery fire from Kinmen Island, and their test scores are consistently high. In many offices and units, officers, in addition to strictly adhering to the prescribed study time, often set aside their spare time to study on their own; some officers even designate Sunday afternoons as theory study time.

    解放军军官努力学习理论
    据新华社22日讯　中国人民解放军各机关、部队从今年3月份起共举办了一千一百多所初、中级理论夜校，两百多期初、中级干部理论训练班，吸收广大军官学习理论。同时，大批高级军官采取离职自修的方法，认真学习了政治经济学和哲学。到目前为止，多数单位的中级班都已经学完了政治经济学的资本主义部分，大多数初级班已经学完了社会科学基本知识的课程。
    解放军军官们学习态度认真，成绩很好。驻守福建前线厦门岛前沿阵地的部队军官，经常在金门岛蒋军炮火的袭扰下坚持学习，他们每次的测验成绩都很好。许多机关、部队的军官除了严格遵守规定学习时间以外，还经常抽出业余时间来自习，甚至有些军官把星期天下午也列为理论学习时间。
