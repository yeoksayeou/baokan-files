    A Page of Indictment Against Hierarchical Society
    ——After Watching "The Right to Live"
  　Luo Dou
    One evening, I rushed to Beijing Medical College to watch the film "The Right to Live" again. After the first showing, a female college student standing next to me said to the comrade selling tickets, "Can I buy another ticket? I want to see it again."
    This sentence is the highest reward and praise from the audience for the film.
    What exactly made this college student so interested in "The Right to Live"? Is it because of its moving plot and complex structure? Is it because of its unique and concise film techniques? It should be said that all of these are factors. The film involves three generations, narrating completely the process of a small life from birth to adulthood, and prominently depicts the painful experiences brought to him by his ambiguous background. This is entirely the subject matter of a full-length novel. However, the filmmakers successfully accommodated it in one film. The feeling is compact but not rushed; concise but not careless. The film is also full of seemingly casual but ingenious handling techniques. For example, when Black Mama is about to take little Alberto, who has just turned one year old, out for a walk, she asks him to say goodbye to the Virgin Mary, and the little guy wets himself. Black Mama is busy changing his clothes. As soon as the pair of wet little shoes are taken off, the next shot immediately shows a pair of boots worn by a teenager—more than ten years have passed. These kinds of places have won our approving smiles. However, if we say that this is enough to summarize all the achievements of the film, it would be a bit like "returning the pearl and keeping the casket."
    Standing on a humanitarian standpoint, the filmmakers have clear love and hatred for everything narrated, and to a certain extent, expose the dark side of hierarchical society. In order to maintain the purity of his noble family and the consolidation of his social status, Rafael neither allowed the little life of the illegitimate child born by his daughter to live in the world, nor did he allow his daughter to escape from the convent. So-called father-daughter affection and blood ties retreated in the face of the moral concepts of the upper class. The clearer the film portrays Rafael's ferocious face and his cold-blooded ruthlessness, the more realistic the hypocritical face of the upper class we see. This little life was lucky enough to survive, but because of his ambiguous background and his Black Mama, he could not live a normal life like ordinary people, despite his intelligence, ability, and ambition. Society is like a madman who has lost his rationality, trampling on an ordinary person's pride and dignity as a human being under his feet. It is precisely here that the film breaks through the theme of fighting for the right to survival of an illegitimate child it depicts, and further shouts out to society, demanding the right to live and the right to be human, for more people—those of "lowly" origin and those living under racial discrimination.
    If we can regard this film as a page of indictment against hierarchical society, then Black Mama Dolores is the reader of this page of indictment. She is the most beautiful and beloved person in this film. In many places, the film makes a clear contrast between her honesty and kindness and Rafael's cold-bloodedness and cruelty. Rafael hates his daughter who "ruined the family's reputation," while she sympathizes with this deceived and abandoned mother; Rafael wants to kill the little life in the cradle, but she rescues this little life from the brink of death. Every such comparison is like a loud slap in the face to the upper class: it is not the lords of noble birth who have humanity, but this black person who is considered inferior. Black Mama uses her pair of hardworking hands and a kind heart to raise Alberto to adulthood. For her, the greatest comfort is that Alberto can love her as he loves his own mother; and what she fears most is losing Alberto's love. Isn't this understandable? Can we blame a mother's love for her son as selfish? In the last scene of the film, when Alberto's biological mother, Elena, runs to find her son, Elena's longing for her son for more than twenty years turns into resentment at this time, erupting like a flood. However, Black Mama just listens with tears streaming down her face, occasionally interjecting a word or two, still calling her "my little Elena"; until she really can't bear it anymore, she stands up to defend herself, but in her defense, she is still very considerate of Elena, without the slightest hint of blaming her. But in another place it is completely different. She says to Rafael, who came to learn about Alberto's background, "All you know is to love your status, love your airs, and love your pride!" A very powerful accusation, only because of the depth of her love.
    The film ends satisfactorily. Because Alberto is fortunate enough to meet Mr. Luis, an idealized person rarely seen in such a society, and also because he himself is of noble origin. However, we can all feel that the problem that seems to be solved in the film is actually not solved, and cannot be solved alone.

    一页对等级社会的控诉书
    ——“生的权利”观后
  　罗斗
    一天晚上，我赶到北京医学院去重看“生的权利”这部影片。第一场映完后，站在我旁边的一位女大学生对那位卖票的同志说：“让我再买一张票好吗？我想再看一场。”
    这一句话，是观众对于影片的最高的奖励与赞扬。
    究竟是甚么使这位大学生对“生的权利”发生了这样大的兴趣呢？是因为它的情节动人、结构复杂吗？是因为它独特的、简练的电影手法吗？应该说，这些都是。这部影片涉及了祖孙三代，完整地叙述了一条小生命从出世到长大成人的过程，突出地描写了他的暖昧不明的身世所带给他的痛苦的经历。这完全是一部长篇小说的题材。但是电影制作者却把它成功地容纳在一部影片内。给人的感觉是紧凑、但不匆忙；简练，但不草率。影片中也不乏似乎是信手拈来、但又别具心裁的处理手法。例如黑妈妈准备抱着刚满一周岁的小阿尔培托出去散步，要他和圣母说再见时，这小家伙尿湿了，黑妈妈忙着给他换衣服。等那双尿湿了的小鞋一脱掉，紧接着出现的下一个镜头就是脚上换上了一双十几岁的大孩子穿的靴子——十多年过去了。这种地方都博得了我们赞许的微笑。但是，假如说这已经足以概括影片的全部成就，那就有点近于“买椟还珠”了。
    影片作者站在人道主义立场上，对所叙述的一切有着明显的爱憎，在一定程度上揭露了等级社会的黑暗面。拉腓尔为了维护自己高贵门第的清白，社会地位的巩固，既不容许女儿养下的私生子这条小生命活在世界上，把女儿也送进了修道院。所谓父女之情、骨肉之亲，在上流社会的道德观念面前退让了。影片把拉腓尔那副狰狞的面目和他的冷酷无情勾划得越清楚，上流社会的伪善的面目，我们也就看得越逼真。这条小生命算是侥幸活下来了，但是因为他暖昧不明的身世，因为他的黑妈妈，他不能像一般人一样地过着正常的生活，尽管他聪明，能干，有抱负。社会就像是一个失去了理性的狂人，把一个普通人的作为人的骄傲和尊严，放在自己脚下尽情地践踏。正是在这里，影片突破了它所描写的为一个私生子的生存权而斗争的题材，进而为更多的人——出身“低贱”的人和在种族歧视下过日子的人，喊出了向社会要求生活的权利、做人的权利的呼声。
    如果说，可以把这部影片看作是一页对等级社会的控诉书，那么黑妈妈多罗累斯，就是这页控诉书的宣读者。她是这部影片中最美、最为我们所喜爱的人。影片在许多地方把她的忠厚、善良和拉腓尔的冷酷、残忍作了鲜明的对比。拉腓尔恨死了自己“败坏门风”的女儿，她则同情这个受了欺骗、又遭遗弃的母亲；拉腓尔要弄死摇篮里的小生命，她却从死亡的边缘上把这条小生命抢救回来。每一处这样的对比都等于是给了上流社会一记响亮的耳光：有人性的不是出身高贵门第的老爷，而是这个被认为低人一等的黑人。黑妈妈用她那一双勤劳的手和一颗善良的心，把阿尔培托抚育成人。对于她，最大的安慰就是阿尔培托能像爱亲母亲一样地爱她；而她最害怕的也就是唯恐失去阿尔培托的爱。这难道是不可以理解的吗？难道可以责怪一个母亲对儿子的爱为自私吗？在影片最后，阿尔培托的亲母爱伦娜跑来找儿子的那一场戏里，爱伦娜二十多年来对儿子的思念这时全变成了怨恨，像决堤的江洪似地全部发泄了出来。但是，黑妈妈只是泪流满面的听着，间或插一两句，也仍然是一口一个“我的小爱伦娜”；直到后来实在受不了了，才起来为自己申辩，但申辩中也仍然十分体谅爱伦娜，没有丝毫责怪她的意思。但在另一个地方就完全不同了，她对来了解阿尔培托身世的拉腓尔说：“你就知道爱你的身分，爱你的架子，爱你的骄傲！”十分有力的指斥，只因为爱得深沉的缘故。
    影片是圆满地结束的。因为阿尔培托十分幸运地在生活中碰到了一位在那样的社会中难得遇见的、理想化的路易斯先生，同时也因为他自己本来就是贵族出身。但是，我们也都能感觉到：这个在影片中似乎解决了的问题，实际上并没有解决，而且也是无法单独解决的。
