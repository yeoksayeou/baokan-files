Respectable Chinese Premier, Governor, and all dear brothers and friends:

I have never been to China before, nor have I been to Yunnan. This is my first visit to China. Now that I am here, I bring with me the friendship of the Burmese people towards the Chinese people, and this friendship will be a friendship that promotes the consolidation of friendship between Burma and China. Therefore, I believe that this visit of mine is a very auspicious visit.

When we look back at the history of Burma and China, we can see that since ancient times, for two thousand years, our two countries, Burma and China, have always coexisted peacefully and friendly. In these two thousand years, there has been almost no conflict between our two countries, perhaps only two or three conflicts. Therefore, based on this, that is, based on the fact that there have only been two or three conflicts between us in two thousand years, we can say that our two countries, Burma and China, have historically been very friendly nations. The fact that our two countries have been friendly for two thousand years can be proven by the following: in Burmese, Chinese people are called "Pauk-phaw," which means siblings born of the same mother. From this, we can see how close the Burmese feel towards the Chinese, and to this day, the Burmese still respect and love the Chinese as if they were their own siblings.

Currently, China, as a people's country, is engaged in construction; Burma, also as a people's country, is engaged in construction. Although China and Burma are following different paths in construction, our ultimate goals are the same. Our two countries not only share the same goals, but are also peace-loving and opposed to war; both of our countries demand peace. Despite differences in ideology, politics, and economics, we are both countries that adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by U Nu and Zhou Enlai, and we advocate resolving differences between countries through peaceful consultation. At the same time, in terms of cultural structure, our two countries, Burma and China, are very similar. Under these circumstances, our two countries, Burma and China, have had traditional friendship in history, and currently have common goals, and are jointly striving for world peace, while also having similarities in culture. Under these circumstances, I firmly believe that we can establish an even closer friendship than we have had in our history. In the process of consolidating friendly relations between our two countries, the most important thing is the people on our two countries' borders, because if the people living closest to the border can understand each other and become friendly with each other, the friendship between our two peoples will be guaranteed. We believe that the joint celebration of the border people of Burma and China held in Mangshi will be successful, thereby consolidating the friendship between Burma and China. I respectfully wish the friendship between Burma and China lasting forever! Long live world peace!

### 在本月十五日到达我国国境后  吴巴瑞总理在畹町的讲话

    在本月十五日到达我国国境后
    吴巴瑞总理在畹町的讲话尊敬的中国总理，省长和各位亲爱的兄弟朋友们：
    我过去没有到过中国，也没有到过云南。这是我第一次来访问中国。当我现在来到此地的时候，我带来了缅甸人民对中国人民的情谊，而这种情谊，将是促进缅中两国友好的巩固的情谊。因此，我认为我这次的访问是一种非常吉祥的访问。
    当我们回顾缅中两国的历史的时候，我们可以看到，自从远古的两千年以来，我们缅中两国就一直是和平友好地共处着。在这两千年中，我们两国之间可以说是几乎没有什么冲突的，可能只有两次或者是三次冲突。因此，根据这一点，就是说根据两千年来我们之间只有过两次或者三次冲突的情况来看，我们可以说，我们缅中两国在历史上就一直是非常友好的两个民族。说我们两国在两千年以来一直是友好的，这点可以从下面的事实得到证明：在缅甸称呼中国人是“胞波”，所谓“胞波”，意思就是同母所生的同胞兄弟。从这一点，我们可以看到缅甸人对中国人是如何的亲密，而到目前为止，缅甸人一直是把中国人作为自己亲生兄弟一般地敬爱着。
    目前，中国作为人民的国家在进行着建设；缅甸也作为人民的国家在进行着建设。虽然中国和缅甸两个国家进行建设的道路有所不同，但是我们最后的目标是一致的。我们两个国家不仅目标相同，而且都是爱好和平反对战争的，我们两国都要求和平。尽管在意识形态上、政治上、经济上有所不同，但是我们都是坚守吴努和周恩来所倡导的和平共处五项原则的国家，并且是主张用和平协商方式来解决国与国之间的分歧的国家。同时，在文化结构方面，我们缅中两国之间也是非常相近的。在这种情况之下，我们缅中两国在历史上就有着传统的友谊，并且在当前来说也有着共同的目标，而且是共同为着世界和平而进行奋斗，同时在文化方面也有着相同之处。在这种情况下，我坚决相信我们一定可以建立起比我们历史上更加亲密的友谊。在我们两国巩固友好关系的过程之中，最为重要的是我们两国边界的人民，因为，如果我们住在边界最邻近的人能够互相取得谅解，并且互相取得友好的话，我们两国人民的友好一定会得到保证。我们相信在芒市举行的缅中两国的边境人民的联欢大会，将会获得成功，并且从而巩固缅中两国之间的友谊，我敬祝缅中友谊万岁！世界和平万岁！
