　  China's First Antibiotic Factory - Shanghai Third Pharmaceutical Factory
　  Completes Annual Penicillin Production Plan One Month Ahead of Schedule
    The factory produced over 11 million more bottles of penicillin in eleven months than the planned output for 1957; the entire factory is preparing for further expansion to take on the task of producing chlortetracycline next year.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 2nd. China's first antibiotic factory, the state-owned Shanghai Third Pharmaceutical Factory, completed its planned output and value for penicillin production this year one month ahead of schedule at the end of November. In eleven months, the factory produced over 11 million more bottles of penicillin than the state-stipulated planned output for the factory in 1957. The cost of penicillin has been reduced by an average of 37.5% this year compared to last year.
    Penicillin is a comprehensive biological product, and its manufacturing technology is relatively complex. This year, the technical level of the Third Pharmaceutical Factory in producing this drug has significantly improved. In the past few years, the factory frequently had to rework large batches due to unqualified product fineness, purity, and content. In the first half of this year, quality issues even led to rework losses of nearly 700,000 yuan worth of penicillin. In July, with the assistance of relevant parties, the factory successfully developed a microcrystalline method and added a set of equipment, resolving the quality problem that had persisted for several years. In the last three to four months, the content and fineness of penicillin have been 100% qualified.
    The Third Pharmaceutical Factory has been producing penicillin for five years. Currently, based on the penicillin production technology, the factory is further expanding to prepare for the large-scale production of another antibiotic, chlortetracycline, next year, which is used to treat diseases such as peritonitis and typhus.

　  我国第一个抗生素工厂——上海第三制药厂
　  提前一个月完成年度青霉素生产计划
    十一个月生产的青霉素，比1957年计划产量多一千一百多万瓶；全厂准备进一步扩建，迎接明年生产金霉素的任务。
    新华社上海2日电　我国第一个抗生素工厂——国营上海第三制药厂，在11月底提前一个月完成今年青霉素的产量和产值计划。这个厂在十一个月中生产的青霉素，比国家规定这个厂1957年的计划产量还要多一千一百多万瓶。青霉素的成本，今年平均比去年降低了37.5％。
    青霉素是一种综合性的生物制品，制造技术比较复杂。今年，第三制药厂生产这种药品的技术水平有了显著提高。过去几年中，这个厂经常因为产品的细度、纯度、含量不合格而造成大批返工。今年上半年还曾经因为质量不合格，返工损失了价值近七十万元的青霉素。7月份，这个厂在有关方面协助下，研究成功了一种微粒结晶的方法，并且添置了一套设备，几年来一直没有解决的质量问题获得了解决。最近三、四个月，青霉素的含量和细度都百分之百合格。
    第三制药厂生产青霉素有五年了。现在，这个厂正在生产青霉素的技术基础上，进一步扩建，准备明年大量生产另一种治疗腹膜炎、斑疹伤寒等疾病的抗生素——金霉素。
