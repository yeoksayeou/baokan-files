Xinhua News Agency, December 13th, Northern Ireland Dispatch: The Irish nationalist organization "Irish Republican Army" launched a series of surprise attacks on some British facilities in Northern Ireland on the early morning of December 12th.

    They blew up a relay station of the British Broadcasting Corporation in the Northern Ireland city of Londonderry. The roof of the relay station building was blown off, and the control room and a workshop worth thousands of pounds were destroyed. They blew up the courthouse in Melfort. In Arma, they attacked the barracks.

    The British government in Northern Ireland was greatly alarmed by the attack and dispatched 12,000 helmeted police officers to blockade the border and conduct house-to-house searches. At this time, "Irish Republican Army" personnel had already retreated on a large scale towards the border.

    The "Irish Republican Army" has long declared that, if necessary, it will use force to return Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland. Their attacks have been particularly active since the British government became embroiled in the Suez issue; however, such a large-scale operation is the first in recent years.

    (Editor's note) The Republic of Ireland is located in the southern part of the island of Ireland, one of the British Isles. For hundreds of years, the Irish people have demanded the establishment of an independent nation-state, but this desire has been suppressed by the British rulers. At the end of the First World War, the revolutionary movement surged throughout Ireland, and guerrilla warfare against Britain was launched everywhere. The British government had to concede, and in the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, it allowed the twenty-six counties in central and southern Ireland to obtain autonomy; however, it still occupied the six most economically developed counties in northern Ireland. In 1937, Ireland promulgated a new constitution, declaring itself an independent republic. Successive cabinets in Ireland after independence have demanded the unification of Northern and Southern Ireland, but Britain has consistently refused to allow it.

### 爱尔兰民族主义组织争取国家的统一  武装袭击北爱尔兰的英国设施

    爱尔兰民族主义组织争取国家的统一
    武装袭击北爱尔兰的英国设施
    新华社13日讯　北爱尔兰消息：爱尔兰民族主义组织“爱尔兰共和国军”12日清晨向北爱尔兰的一些英国设施发动一系列的突然袭击。
    他们在北爱尔兰城市伦敦德黎炸毁了英国广播公司的一个转播站。这个转播站建筑物的屋顶被炸飞了，调度室和一个价值数千英镑的工场被毁坏。他们炸毁了梅腊费耳特的法庭。在亚尔马，他们袭击了兵营。
    北爱尔兰的英国政府对这次袭击大为惊慌，事后出动一万两千个头戴钢盔的警察一面封锁边境一面挨家逐户进行搜索。这时，“爱尔兰共和国军”人员已经大规模向边境撤退。
    “爱尔兰共和国军”早就宣称，假如必要，将用武力来使北爱尔兰回到爱尔兰共和国怀抱里去。自从英国政府陷入苏伊士问题的尴尬处境以来，他们的袭击活动特别活跃；但像这一次这样的大规模行动，在最近几年中还是第一次。
    （编者注）爱尔兰共和国位于英伦三岛之一的爱尔兰岛南部。数百年来爱尔兰人民就一直要求建立独立的民族国家，但是这种愿望却遭到了英国统治者的镇压。第一次世界大战末期，爱尔兰全境革命运动高涨，境内到处发动了反对英国的游击战争，英国政府不得不让步，于1921年的英爱条约中允许爱尔兰中部和南部的二十六个郡取得自治权；但是仍然占据爱尔兰北部的六个经济最发达的郡。1937年爱尔兰颁布新宪法，宣布为独立共和国。爱尔兰独立后的历届内阁都要求统一南北爱尔兰，英国始终不允许。
