Xinhua News Agency, 23rd - The Second Member Representatives Congress of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce closed this afternoon.

Li Zhuchen, Deputy Director of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, delivered a closing speech at the meeting. He said that the Second Member Representatives Congress of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce is now closing after nearly half a month of meetings. He then spoke of how the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, based on the principle of employing people according to their talents, appropriately arranged the work of private personnel in joint ventures, regarded industrialists and businessmen as a national asset, continued to maintain the fixed interest system for a considerable period, and referred to industrialists and businessmen with little capital who also participated in labor as petty bourgeoisie or upper-level petty bourgeoisie. He said: "The trust, importance, and care that the Party and the government have shown us make it difficult for us to express our heartfelt gratitude in appropriate words."

Li Zhuchen said that before and at the beginning of the congress, some industrialists and businessmen had incorrect ideas and views, such as insufficient understanding of the role of the redemption policy and overly impatient sentiments regarding matters that could not be accomplished at present. This anxiety was caused by a lack of deep understanding that the state's peaceful transformation policy is consistently implemented and a failure to recognize the issue from the perspective of combining national interests, long-term interests, and individual interests. He said that through this congress, the representatives further understood the consistency of individual interests and national interests, and recognized that the current common goal of industrialists and businessmen nationwide, like the people of the whole country, is to rapidly develop China's social productive forces and build China into a socialist industrial country.

This afternoon, the representatives attending the congress elected Li Dequan and two hundred and sixty-four others as members of the Second Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and unanimously adopted the Constitution of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and an explanation of the "Constitution of the Federation of Industry and Commerce," as well as six resolutions. These resolutions are: Resolution on Further Promoting Patriotism Among Industrialists and Businessmen Nationwide, Continuing to Strengthen Self-Transformation, and Actively Contributing to Socialist Construction; Resolution on the Work Report of the First Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce for the Past Three Years; Resolution on the Plan for Convening a National Congress of Advanced Producers and Advanced Workers from Industry and Commerce, as well as the Meeting's Budget and Sharing Method; Resolution on the Provisional Plan for the Mutual Aid Fund for the Livelihood of Industry and Commerce and the Explanation of the "Provisional Plan for the Mutual Aid Fund for the Livelihood of Industry and Commerce"; Resolution on the Report of the Proposals Examination Committee of the Congress; and Resolution on the Financial Review Report of the Financial Review Committee of the Congress, the Financial Report of the Federation from 1954 to 1956, the Budget for 1957, and the Method for Members to Pay Membership Dues.

Li Dequan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, addressed the congress. She assessed the progress made by the family members and female industrialists and businesswomen in the past year, and she also hoped that, encouraged by the measure of maintaining fixed interest for seven years, the family members and female industrialists and businesswomen would continue to encourage their relatives and spur themselves on, tirelessly engaging in self-education and self-transformation, so that their relatives and themselves could be transformed into genuine laborers.

This morning, the congress continued for half a day of general discussion, with two hundred and six representatives speaking or submitting written speeches.

During this meeting, the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, the All-China Youth Federation and the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and the All-China Democratic Women's Federation respectively invited Overseas Chinese representatives, youth representatives, female industrial and commercial representatives, and family members of industrial and commercial figures who attended and were present at the meeting to conduct seminars and gatherings.

    更紧密地团结起来为社会主义事业贡献力量
    全国工商联会员代表大会闭幕
    选出第二届执委会委员，通过工商业联合会章程和六个决议
    新华社23日讯　中华全国工商业联合会第二届会员代表大会今天下午闭幕。
    全国工商联副主任委员李烛尘在会上致闭幕词。他说，中华全国工商业联合会第二届会员代表大会经过近半个月的会议，现在闭幕了。接着他谈到中国共产党和人民政府根据量材任用的原则，适当地安排了合营企业私方人员的工作，把工商业者看作国家的一项财富，在相当长时期内继续维持定息制度，对工商业者中间资本很少、自己又参加劳动的人，称为小资产阶级或上层小资产阶级。他说：“党和政府对于我们这样的信任、重视和关怀，使我们很难有适当的言语来表达我们衷心的感激。”
    李烛尘说，在参加大会以前和大会开始时，工商业者中间有些人曾经存在过不正确的思想和看法，如对于赎买政策的作用体会不够，对于目前还不能办到的事情，也存在过于急躁的情绪。这种患得患失的情绪，是由于没有深刻体会到国家的和平改造政策是贯彻始终的，没有从国家利益、长远利益和个人利益结合起来去认识问题所造成的。他说，经过这次大会，代表们进一步了解到个人利益和国家利益的一致性，认识到全国工商业者当前共同的奋斗目标，和全国人民一样，就是迅速地发展我国的社会生产力，把我国建设成为社会主义的工业国。
    今天下午，出席大会的代表选举了李德臣等二百六十五人为中华全国工商业联合会第二届执行委员会执行委员，一致通过了工商业联合会章程和关于“工商业联合会章程”的说明，以及六个决议。这些决议是：关于全国工商业者进一步发扬爱国主义精神，继续加强自我改造，积极为社会主义建设作出贡献的决议；关于全国工商联第一届执行委员会三年来的工作报告的决议；关于召开全国工商界先进生产者和先进工作者代表会议方案以及会议的经费预算和分担办法的决议；关于工商界生活互助金暂行方案及关于“工商界生活互助金暂行方案”的说明的决议；关于大会提案审查委员会提案审查报告的决议；以及关于大会财务审查委员会财务审查报告、本会1954年至1956年三年财务报告、1957年度经费预算及会员交纳会费办法的决议。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席李德全向大会致词。她对工商业者家属和女工商业者一年来的进步作了估价，她还希望工商业者家属和女工商业者在定息保持七年这一措施的鼓舞下，继续鼓励亲人，鞭策自己，不倦地进行自我教育，自我改造，使自己的亲属和自己都能改造成为名副其实的劳动者。
    今天上午，大会继续进行了半天的大会讨论，有二百零六位代表发言或作了书面发言。
    在这次会议过程中，中华全国归国华侨联合会和中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会，中华全国民主青年联合会和中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会，中华全国民主妇女联合会，分别邀请出席和列席这次会议的华侨代表、青年代表、女工商业者代表和工商业者家属，进行座谈和联欢。
