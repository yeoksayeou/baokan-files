    Steelmaking with Native Iron
    Xinhua News Agency report: In the past three months, the Shanghai Steel Company has already mixed more than 2,000 tons of native iron into its steelmaking raw materials.
    Native iron is iron smelted by crude methods in China's rural areas. In the event of insufficient supplies of scrap steel and blast furnace pig iron, Shanghai's open-hearth furnaces began mixing a portion of native iron into their steelmaking raw materials in September. Although the composition of native iron is relatively complex, making it difficult to control the quality of the steel when used for steelmaking, there has been no fluctuation in steel quality in the past three months.
    Currently, relevant departments are preparing to send personnel to relevant provinces to further investigate the resources of native iron and study how to utilize more native iron.

    土铁炼钢
    新华社讯　上海钢铁公司最近三个多月里已经在炼钢原料中掺用了两千多吨土铁。
    土铁是我国农村里用土法炼制出来的铁。在废钢和高炉生铁供应不足的情况下，上海各平炉从9月份起就在炼钢原料中掺用一部分土铁。虽然土铁的成份比较复杂，用来炼钢的时候，钢的质量难以控制，但是三个多月来并没有造成钢的质量波动。
    目前，有关部门准备派人到有关省份去进一步调查土铁的资源和研究如何更多地利用土铁。
