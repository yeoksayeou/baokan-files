    Song Shilong Bravely Rescues Farm Cattle from Fire
    "If it weren't for Old Man Song, all the farm cattle of the Fifth Team would have been burned to death!" When you go to Yinjia Agricultural Cooperative in Qixiang Township, Linli County, Hunan, the members will invariably tell you this.
    Speaking of Old Man Song - Song Shilong's rescue of farm cattle, it was on the evening of the 25th of last month. At that time, the eight farm cattle of the Fifth Team had just been led into the cowshed when the cowshed caught fire. Seeing that the eight farm cattle were about to be burned alive inside, no one dared to go in to rescue them. At this critical moment, Song Shilong, 58 years old, rushed in regardless of everything. He successively untied two large bulls and one yellow cow in the thick smoke and flames and drove them out of the cowshed. Then, he wanted to untie the other five cows. However, the thick smoke made it impossible for him to distinguish directions, and the clothes on his body were also ignited by the fire, and his head was burned. He had to rush out. (Later, four cows broke their ropes and ran out, and one was burned to death inside.) Before long, he fainted on the ground. When he woke up, a female member said, "Old man, you were too reckless!" He replied, "Without cattle, how can we engage in production!"
    After Song Shilong was injured in the fire while rescuing the farm cattle, he received the kind care of the cooperative. The production team leader prepared a sedan chair for him, and a Party branch committee member and four members escorted him to the county hospital for treatment overnight. Now, his injuries have healed and he has been discharged from the hospital. (New Hunan Daily)

    宋时龙冒火救耕牛
    “不是宋老伯，第五队的耕牛就全部被烧死了！”当你走进湖南临澧县启祥乡殷家农业社，社员们都会不约而同地向你这样说。
    说起宋老伯——宋时龙抢救耕牛，那还是上月25日傍晚的事。那时，五队的八头耕牛刚被牵进牛棚不久，牛棚就失火了。眼看八头耕牛就要被活活烧死在里面，但谁都不敢进去抢救。就在这个紧要关头，五十八岁的宋时龙不顾一切地闯了进去。他在浓烟烈火中先后解开两头大牯牛和一头黄牛的绳索并将它们撵出牛棚后，还想再去解其他五头牛的绳索。可是浓烟熏得他辨不清方向，再加身上的衣服也被火燃着，头又被烧伤，只得急忙奔了出来（后来有四头牛挣断绳索跑了出来，一头被烧死在里面），还没有一会，他就昏倒在地。当他清醒过来时，有个女社员说：“老伯，你太冒险了！”他回答说：“没有牛，我们怎么搞生产呀！”
    宋时龙冒火抢救耕牛负伤后，受到了社里的亲切关怀。生产队长给他扎好了轿子，由一个党支部委员和四个社员连夜送到县卫生院治疗。现在，他的伤势已经痊愈，并已出院了。　（新湖南报）
