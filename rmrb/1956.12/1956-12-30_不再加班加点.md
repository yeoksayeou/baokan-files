    No More Overtime
    A letter from Chen Guangjin, Director of Benxi Coal Mine: The criticism of our mine in the article "Overtime Causes Worry" published on page 2 of the People's Daily on November 2nd is correct. We have now taken the following measures to rectify the situation: (1) Conscientiously promote advanced experience, actively eliminate mechanical accidents, and shorten workers' working hours. (2) Transfer people who have received driver technical training to driver positions to solve the problem of drivers working overtime. (3) Improve labor organization, assign appropriate work based on workers' physical strength, and do a good job of regular rest and rotation.
    A letter from the Benxi Branch of Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction Corporation: After the People's Daily published the article "Overtime Causes Worry" on November 2nd, we, together with the trade union, the Labor and Wage Department, and the Municipal Labor Bureau, conducted a comprehensive inspection and issued a circular criticizing units with serious overtime problems.

    不再加班加点
    本溪煤矿矿长陈光进来信：人民日报11月2日二版登载的“加班加点惹人愁”一文中对我矿的批评是正确的。现在我们已采取了下列措施进行改正（一）认真推广先进经验，积极消除机械事故，缩短工人工作时间。（二）将受过司机技术训练的人调作司机工作，解决司机加班加点问题。（三）改进劳动组织，根据工人的体力分配适当工作，搞好定期轮休工作。
    鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司本溪分公司来信，人民日报11月2日发表了“加班加点惹人愁”一文后，我们会同工会、劳动工资处、市劳动局进行了全面的检查并通报批评了加班加点较严重的单位。
