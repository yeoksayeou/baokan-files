    The Development of Science Requires International Peace and Cooperation
    Speech by Ignacy Zlotowski
    Ladies and Gentlemen, dear friends:
    I am honored to address this solemn gathering on behalf of the Polish Academy of Sciences. As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the death of Mr. Curie, one of the most outstanding French physicists, and of Madame Curie, who was born in Poland, I bring you the heartfelt greetings and best wishes of Polish scientists. The names of the Curies are linked to the great climax that shook the scientific world at the end of the last century.
    The last decade of the nineteenth century did indeed witness major events in the fields of physics and chemistry. In 1897, Thomson experimentally proved that electrons are part of the atom, overturning the notion that atoms are indivisible. Almost simultaneously, Zeeman discovered the magneto-optical effect. Shortly after Roentgen discovered X-rays, Henri Becquerel encountered difficulties with the phenomenon of radioactivity. The Curies clarified this problem after epoch-making research and discovered two perplexing chemical elements in 1898 – radium and polonium, named in honor of Madame Curie's homeland.
    Looking back at the half-century since the Curies began their research on radioactivity, we can see that this new science has been applied to many departments of science and technology. In addition, the Curies' discovery pointed the way to solving the most important problems of material structure. In fact, within thirty years after the Curies dramatically presented their great achievements to the world, another young couple in the Curie family announced the possibility of controlling the production of new radioactive isotopes. Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie continued this immortal discovery, studying changes in atomic energy side by side, like Irène's parents.
    By discovering methods of directing radioactivity to non-radioactive elements, the Joliot-Curies expanded the scope of practical applications of radioactive isotopes. Radioactive substances with X-ray energy, with the same effect as radium, brought the prospect of final victory to the great struggle against cancer. This struggle began under the leadership of the Curies at the turn of the two centuries.
    The radium and polonium discovered by the Curies finally revealed to the scientific world the infinite energy hidden in the core of the atom. Tens of thousands of scientists in almost all civilized countries conducted forty years of continuous scientific research to complete the nuclear chain reaction (i.e., the splitting of uranium isotopes), leading to the liberation of a large amount of thermal energy and radioactivity.
    As we now know, the nuclear fission of uranium-235, or the chain reaction of its fission material, leads to the explosion of the atomic bomb. The heat liberated by the nuclear reactor built to control this chain reaction can be used to generate electricity, and radioactivity (available as radium isotopes) brings unlimited benefits to mankind.
    Therefore, the vast amount of nuclear energy liberated by this amazing discovery laid by the Curies is cursed on the one hand because of various types of atomic and hydrogen weapons; on the other hand, it is highly praised as the greatest achievement in the history of science and opens a new chapter for human civilization.
    More than fifty years ago, Mr. Curie, in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, warned the world against possible future risky actions from the use of new radioactive elements and the further development of science and technology that came with the discovery of radioactivity. Of course, there is no doubt that science itself cannot be held responsible for the damage it brings to mankind when scientific discoveries are used for war. The responsibility lies with the nations of the world to ensure that science is no longer used for mutual destruction, but only for their common interests.
    In fact, the discovery of nuclear energy is by no means just another scientific discovery, but a concrete milestone in world progress. Therefore, regardless of possible dangers and risky actions, we have made full use of nuclear energy. The primary step to eliminate all fears and massively utilize nuclear energy peacefully around the world is undoubtedly to strengthen cooperation among scientists worldwide, especially those engaged in nuclear research. In fact, not only the wide application of new scientific discoveries, but also scientific life as an intellectual progress largely depends on the unimpeded exchange of scientific and technical information among researchers of all nations. Science can only develop in an atmosphere of peace, freedom and mutual understanding.
    Every scientist knows that it is meaningless to conduct research work in isolation. Every valuable scientific work is possible only because of the concentration of the spiritual heritage introduced by people from many countries. Without Benjamin Franklin, the great American scientist and thinker, in the discovery of the basic phenomena of electricity in Philadelphia, it would of course have been impossible for the Curies to open up the unexpected prospects of energy discovery. Without the basic scientific contributions made by the Curies in Paris fifty years ago, the rapid development of the nuclear industry in the United States today would also be unimaginable.
    The Curies were convinced that only through the freest exchange of scientific ideas internationally and the closest cooperation among scientists from all countries can people ensure genuine cultural and economic progress in the world. They never hesitated to publish the results of their work, if they thought it was worth publishing, and repeatedly stated that sharing their knowledge and experience with the world is not only the inalienable right of all researchers, but also their sacred duty. They often refused to derive any economic benefit from their research work, which, as they often said, "should belong to all mankind."
    Moreover, the social responsibility of scientists as citizens is as important as their work of discovering new things in scientific cases. The Curies were not satisfied with just discovering and studying new discoveries, they also hoped to see their discoveries used in practice to the greatest extent possible. They understood that even highly developed science is of limited value as long as the majority of mankind does not benefit from it. They understood even more that as long as millions of people struggle with hunger, disease, and death every year, then scientific methods that can save people's lives, improve health, and improve living conditions are meaningless.
    The Curies believed in the great economic and political power of science, seeing it as one of the methods to eradicate the basic disasters of mankind—poverty and war, disasters which attempt to cancel out many opportunities opened up by the progress of science, that scientific principles should be extended to all aspects of human activity. They believed that science and technology themselves are good, representing a huge force for uniting the world, a force that should play a good role to the greatest extent possible.
    The short married life of the Curies and the only joy was to engage in scientific research work that both were interested in, which will become the most prominent symbol of international cooperation in modern scientific records. The comradeship in science and the attempt to improve the intellectual and economic levels of all countries made all the scientists who came to the Radium Institute in Paris from all over the world active, and became the tradition of the truly international research center founded and inspired by Madame Curie. Scientists from twenty-five countries have worked in this institute. I remember that in 1933 more than fifteen different nationalities worked in Madame Curie's laboratory.
    Now, as we stand on the threshold of this new atomic age, this atomic age created by a series of inventions and discoveries pioneered by Becquerel and the Curies and continued by countless laboratories in many countries, makes us understand the importance of international scientific cooperation more than ever before. Science had to wait until the twentieth century to launch a broad offensive against the atomic heart. It was delayed until today, not only because new tools, new advances in engineering, and new technologies had to serve this huge work, but also because people had to understand: only on the basis of world-scale cooperation can scientific problems be successfully solved.
    In fact, millions of highly capable men and women in the world are dedicating themselves to science for the benefit of mankind. They form the core of a huge potential force and can weld all civilized countries into a large family with a common goal, which is the prosperity and happiness of all peoples, regardless of their nationality, race, religious belief, and political opinion. Science, as a summary of experience, is basically the same for all scientists. There is no scientific problem that belongs only to China, the United States, France, or Poland. But there are scientists from China, the United States, France, and Poland. Since science is no longer an auxiliary factor in the social, economic, and political life of every country, but an absolutely inseparable part of it, the value of science in our time cannot be measured solely by the usefulness of its practical applications. Scientific knowledge has become the foundation of every country's future. Therefore, every country should have the talent, ability, wisdom, and indomitable will to promote the progress of science. Scientists who have learned to devote themselves to scientific research will surely open up a path to new achievements in a better world. In order to accelerate the arrival of these brilliant prospects, barriers that are not conducive to the use of talent must be eliminated. Another important task is to make people understand that science is a combination of people, working side by side, united by their special achievements to serve mankind's belief, especially to establish frequent and the closest connection between our youth and great international scientists. The history of scientific progress has brought glory to the world's great citizens in the style of Franklin and the Curies, who have become outstanding benefactors of mankind with their scientific achievements.
    But the more science develops, the more it needs mutual understanding and justice in the world. With the discovery of large-scale nuclear energy, the complex problem of how scientific progress can better fit the purpose of improving life has become a challenge to mankind. The greatest responsibility of scientists is to do everything possible to ensure that the world's great scientific heritage is never misused—to serve destructive purposes, but to be the cornerstone of our cultural and economic progress for the common welfare of society. In order to achieve this ultimate goal, scientists should not only cooperate in developing scientific interests and paving the way for the widespread application of scientific knowledge, but also in developing cultural and economic relations between countries and maintaining lasting world peace.
    It is a shame if the people of the world have to spend huge sums of money year after year to resist "possible aggressors," while allowing major areas of scientific research to lie barren due to lack of funding. We call this the real tragedy of the twentieth century: countless excellent scientific minds and an important part of the world's productivity are constantly used to develop and manufacture weapons of mass destruction based on the most amazing discoveries of our time. The new magical medical and agricultural progress brought about by the same discoveries can bring a better life to all of us, but it is still in its initial stages. Whenever there is news about more ingenious and more powerful nuclear weapons, the conquest of cancer is never in sight, and we only have a vague concept of improving food production to better suit the world's needs with modern science.
    When Benjamin Franklin wanted to discover the true nature of electricity and when the Curies laid the foundation for the magnificent palace of nuclear science, they certainly did not have such a dark world view in mind. They worked under enormous resistance, they dedicated themselves to long and hard research, because they were inspired by an earnest hope, hoping to build a better world, a country of peace and brotherly love, a country of prosperity and happiness for all mankind.
    Let us pay tribute to these great figures, whose names symbolize two milestones in world progress—mastering electricity and discovering nuclear energy—proving to mankind that science as a tool for peace is more powerful than as a weapon for war. War must be eliminated, and world peace must be guaranteed. (Attached picture)

### 科学的发展需要国际的和平与合作  伊格纳西·兹沃托夫斯基的讲话

专栏：在富兰克林、居里夫妇纪念会上

    科学的发展需要国际的和平与合作
    伊格纳西·兹沃托夫斯基的讲话女士们、先生们、亲爱的朋友们：
    我荣幸地代表波兰科学院在这个崇高的集会上致词。在我们纪念最杰出的法国物理学家之一的居里先生逝世五十周年，以及在波兰出生的居里夫人的时候，我给你们带来了波兰科学家的衷心的致意和最好的祝愿。居里夫妇的名字是和上个世纪的末期震动科学世界的巨大高潮联系在一起的。
    十九世纪最后十年在物理和化学的领域内的确发生了重大的事件。1897年汤姆生用实验证明电子是原子的一部分，而推翻了原子不可分割的说法。几乎是同时，锡曼发现了磁光效果，紧跟着栾琴发现了X射线之后，亨利·贝克勒尔在放射能的现象上遇到了困难，而居里夫妇在作了划时代的研究之后弄清了这个问题，并在1898年发现了两个令人困惑的化学元素——镭和为了纪念居里夫人祖国而命名的钋。
    我们回顾从居里夫妇开始研究放射能以后的半个世纪的过程，可以看到这门新的科学被应用到科学和技术的许多部门中。此外，居里夫妇的发现为解决物质结构的最重要的问题指出了方向。事实上，在居里夫妇把他们的伟大成就戏剧性地呈现在世界面前以后的三十多年内，在居里的一家中又有一对年轻的夫妇宣布了控制新的放射性同位素生产的可能性。爱伦和约里奥·居里继续着这一不朽的发现，像爱伦的父母一样并肩地研究着原子能的变化。
    由于发现了放射能引向非放射元素的方法，约里奥夫妇扩大了放射性同位素实际应用的范围。和镭有同等作用的带有X射线能的放射性物质给对癌的伟大斗争带来了最后胜利的前景。这个斗争在居里夫妇领导之下开始于两个世纪的交替时期。
    居里夫妇发现的镭和钋最后向科学世界揭示了在原子的核心里潜藏着无穷的能。几乎是所有文明国家里上万的科学家进行了四十年不间断的科学研究，才完成了核子的链锁反应（也即铀的同位素的分裂），并导致了大量热能和放射能的解放。
    像我们现在所知道的，铀235的核分裂或是它分裂物质的链锁反应导向原子弹的爆炸。而为了控制这种链锁反应而建立的核子反应器解放出来的热可以用来发电和放射能（可用作镭的同位素），给人类带来了无限的福利。
    因此，居里夫妇奠基的这个惊人的发现所解放出来的大量核子能，一方面因为各种类型的原子武器和氢武器而被人咒诅；另一方面它作为科学史上最伟大的成就，以及为人类文明打开了新的一章，而受到高度的赞扬。
    五十多年前，居里先生在他获得诺贝尔奖金时的演说中，已经警告全世界来反对未来利用新的放射性元素以及随放射能的发现而来的科学与技术进一步的发展的可能有的冒险行动。当然，无疑问地当科学的发现被战争利用时，科学本身对给人类带来的损害是不可能负责的。其责任在于世界各民族肯定不再利用科学进行相互的毁灭，而仅利用在他们共同利益上。
    事实上核子能的发现决不是另一个科学新发现，而是世界进展的具体里程碑。所以我们不顾可能有的危险与冒险行动，已经充分利用了核子能。欲消除一切恐惧以在全世界大量和平利用核子能的首要步骤，无疑问地是世界科学家特别是从事于核子研究的科学家之间合作的加强。事实上，不但科学新发现的广泛应用，而且作为智力进展的科学生命在极大程度上取决于各民族研究者之间的科学以及技术情报的无阻碍的交换。科学只有在和平、自由以及相互了解的气氛中才能发展的。
    每一个科学家都知道孤立地进行研究工作是没有意义的。就因为许多国家人们所介绍的精神遗产的集中，每一件有价值的科学工作才有可能。没有本杰明·富兰克林、美国伟大的科学家与思想家，在费城电的基本现象的发现，当然居里夫妇发现能的意外远景的开辟是不可能的。没有五十年前居里夫妇在巴黎所作的基本科学贡献，今天在美国核子工业的迅速发展，同样也是不可想像的。
    居里夫妇深信只有通过国际间科学思想最自由的交流以及各国科学家之间最紧密的合作，人们才能保证世界上文化以及经济上的真正进展。他们从不犹豫于公开他们工作的结果，要是他们认为值得公开的话，而且再三表示同全世界分享他们的知识和经验，不仅是所有研究者不可动摇的权利，而且也是他们神圣的职责。他们经常拒绝从他们的研究工作中取得任何经济上的利益，那种工作，正如他们通常所说的：“应该属于全人类”。
    而且作为公民的科学家，社会责任正如他们科学事例新发现的工作同样是重要的。居里夫妇不满足仅止于发掘以及研究新发现的工作，他们也希望看到他们的发现在最大的可能上用于实践上。他们理解到只要是大多数人类没有得到实惠，即使具有高度发展的科学，其价值也是有限的。他们更理解到只要每年有千百万人挣扎在饥饿、病痛和死亡线上，那么，就是能拯救人们生命、增进健康和改善生活条件的科学方法，也是没有什么意义的。
    居里夫妇相信科学的巨大经济和政治力量，看出了根除人类基本灾害——贫困与战争的方法之一，这种灾害企图取消由科学的进展所打开的很多机会，即科学原则应当扩展到人类活动的各个方面。他们相信科学和技术本身是好的，能代表一种巨大的团结世界的力量，这种力量应当在最大范围内起好的作用。
    居里夫妇短短的婚姻生活和唯一欢乐是从事他们俩都感兴趣的科学研究工作，在现代科学记录中会成为国际合作的最突出的象征。在科学中的同志精神以及提高所有国家知识和经济水平的企图，使所有从世界各处到巴黎镭研究所来的科学家们活跃起来，并成为那个由居里夫人所创立和鼓舞的真正国际研究中心的传统。从二十五个国家来的科学家们在这研究所工作过。我记得1933年一年中十五种以上不同的民族在居里夫人研究室当过工作人员。
    现在，我们站在这新原子时代的门槛，这个由贝克勒尔和居里夫妇开创而被许多国家的无数研究室继续的一连串的发明与发现所造成的原子时代，使我们比以前任何时候都更了解国际科学合作的重要性。科学必须等到二十世纪才能向原子心脏展开广泛的进攻。它所以拖延到今天，不仅因为新工具、工程的新进步，以及新技术都必须为这项巨大工作服务，并且因为人也必须明了：只有在世界规模的合作的基础上，科学的问题才能成功地解决。
    实际上世界上有千百万能力极强的男女为了人类的利益献身于科学，他们组成了一个巨大潜在力量的核心，并能把所有文明的国家焊接成一个具有共同目标的大家庭，这目标就是各族人民之间的繁荣和幸福，而不管他们的国籍、种族、宗教信仰和政治见解如何。科学，作为经验的总结，对所有科学家基本上都是一样的。没有任何科学上的问题，是只属于中国、美国、法国或波兰的。可是倒有中国、美国、法国和波兰的科学家们。既然科学已不是每一个国家的社会、经济和政治生活中辅助的因素，而是它绝对不可分割的一部分，因此，科学的价值在我们这个时代根本不能用它的实际应用的用处多少来衡量，科学知识已成为每一国家前途的基础。因此，每一国家都应当有天才、有能力、有智慧和不屈的意志来推动科学的进展。已经学会把自己投入科学研究之中的科学家一定会为一个更好的世界中新成就开辟出道路来。为了加速这些光辉的远景的到来，凡是不利于使用才能的障碍必须予以排除。另外还有一个重要的任务，就是使人们明白科学乃是人群的结合，并肩地工作，以他们的特殊的成就服务于人类的信念来团结起来，尤其是要使我们的青年和伟大的国际科学家取得经常的和最亲密的联系。科学进步的历史给富兰克林和居里夫妇式的世界上伟大的公民带来了光荣，这些人就是以他们的科学伟业而成为人类杰出的造福者。
    但科学越发展，就越需要世界上的相互了解和正义。随着大规模核子能的发现，科学的进步如何更好地配合生活提高的目的这复杂的问题已成为向人类的一个挑战。科学家最大的责任就是尽一切力量保证世界伟大的科学遗产永远不再被误用——为毁灭性的目的服务，而反过来要将为着社会共同福利作为我们文化与经济进步的基石。为了达到这最终的目的，科学家不仅要在发展科学利益以及为广泛应用科学知识铺平道路方面合作，而且在发展各国间文化经济关系以及维护世界持久和平方面也应合作起来。
    这是一个耻辱，假如世界上的人民连年连月必须化一笔巨大的款项为了抵御“可能来的侵略者”，而听任科学研究的主要领域却因缺乏经费而荒芜着。我们把这叫做二十世纪真正的悲剧：无数优秀的科学头脑以及世界生产力的一个重要部分经常地用在基于我们时代最惊人发现的基础上为发展和制造大规模毁灭性的武器，由于同样的发现带来的新的神奇的医药和农业上的进步，它可以给我们全体带来更好的生活却始终停留在初期阶段，每当有关于更机巧和更有力的核子武器的消息时，癌症的征服却始终不见端倪，而我们对于以现代化科学提高粮食生产更好适合世界需要却只有一个模糊的概念。
    本杰明·富兰克林想发现电的真实性质时以及居里夫妇给核子科学的宏伟宫殿打下基础时，他们当然没有这样一个黑暗的世界观在脑海里。他们在巨大的阻力下工作着，他们献身于长久辛苦的研究，因为他们有着一个恳切的希望鼓舞着，希望建立一个更美好的世界，一个和平和兄弟般友爱的国家，一个全人类繁荣幸福的国家。
    让我们向这些伟大的人物致敬，他们的名字象征着世界进步的二个里程碑——掌握电以及发现核子能——向人类证明科学作为和平的工具是比作为战争的武器更有力量。战争一定可以消灭，世界和平一定可以获得保证。（附图片）
