　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th -- More than ten experts in botany, agriculture, forestry, horticulture, geography and other fields in our country recently conducted on-site observations in Dinghu Mountain, west of Guangzhou, and confirmed that there are many tropical and subtropical trees aged four to five hundred years in the remaining natural forest covering more than two thousand acres. They estimate that there are at least more than one thousand species of plants in this natural forest, many of which are newly discovered. Scientists have already collected more than seven hundred specimens from here. Scientists believe that studying the remaining natural forests and other plant community types and patterns in this area will be of great help to the future greening of South China.
　　Dinghu Mountain is a region near Guangzhou with a mild climate and beautiful scenery. The mountains are densely wooded, and in addition to the above-mentioned more than two thousand acres of remaining natural forest, there are also more than ten thousand acres of man-made forests. After this on-site inspection by scientists, the South China Botanical Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has planned to establish a Dinghu Mountain Arboretum here, including man-made forests.

　  鼎湖山发现珍贵自然林
    新华社广州7日电　我国十多位植物、农、林、园艺、地理等方面的专家，最近在广州西面的鼎湖山进行了实地观察，确定了这里的占地二千多亩的残存自然林中，有许多生长了四、五百年的热带和亚热带大树。他们估计这个自然林中的植物至少有一千多种，其中有不少是新见的。科学家们已经从这里采集到了七百多种标本。科学家们认为研究这地区的残存自然林和其他植物群落类型及规律，对将来绿化华南的工作有极大的帮助。
    鼎湖山是广州附近的一个气候温和、风景优美的地区。山上林木茂密，除了上述的二千多亩残存的自然林以外，还有一万多亩人造林。经过科学家们的这次实地考察，中国科学院华南植物研究所已计划在这里建立一个包括人造林在内的鼎湖山树木园。
