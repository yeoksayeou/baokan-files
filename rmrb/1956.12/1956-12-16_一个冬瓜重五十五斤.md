    A Winter Melon Weighs Fifty-Five Jin
    The winter melons grown by the Hongjin Agricultural Cooperative in Longtan Township, Huize County, Yunnan, the largest of which weighs fifty-five jin, so one horse can only carry two.

    This year, this cooperative planted ninety-six ridges of winter melon. Each vine bore six to seven melons. After removing the small ones, they recently harvested more than 7,000 jin of mature melons.

    Currently, the four melons kept by the cooperative each weigh fifty-four jin and five liang. The smallest of the others weighs twenty jin, with an average weight of more than thirty jin each. (Zhaotong Daily)

    一个冬瓜重五十五斤
    云南会泽县龙潭乡红巾农业社种出的冬瓜，最大的有五十五斤重、一匹马只能驮两个。
    今年，这个社种了九十六塘冬瓜，一窝瓜结六个到七个，除掉瓜小时扯掉的不算外，最近又收得老瓜有七千多斤。
    现在，社里留下的四个瓜，每个都有五十四斤五两重。其它最小的也有二十斤重，平均一个有三十多斤重。　　　　　（昭通报）
