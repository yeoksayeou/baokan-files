　　Xinhua News Agency, London, December 8th: TASS, London, December 8th: The Political Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement pointing out that the British government is attempting to place the heavy burden of expenses caused by the "unprovoked and barbaric aggression against Egypt" on the shoulders of the working people.

　　The statement then pointed out that the government is now preparing to attack the interests of the broad masses again. The statement said that the Conservative Party's rent bill will greatly increase the rents of millions of tenants, put 200 million pounds into the pockets of landlords at the expense of the interests of the working people, and will make the housing of many tenants insecure.

　　The Political Committee called on the working class to fight against attacks on their rights and to strive for the following demands: immediate increases in wages and benefits, increased taxation on the wealthy, full employment, expanded trade between East and West, lower prices, halving of military spending, shortening military service to twelve months, resolving the Suez Canal issue on the basis of full respect for Egyptian sovereignty and independence, withdrawing British troops from Cyprus, establishing a European collective security system, and withdrawing all foreign troops from East and West Germany.

　　英共号召劳动人民保卫权利
    反对政府转嫁侵埃战争的负担
    新华社8日讯　塔斯社伦敦8日讯：英国共产党政治委员会发表声明，指出英国政府企图把由于“对埃及的无端的野蛮进攻”而引起的开支浩大的负担放在劳动人民肩上。
    声明接着指出，政府现在又在准备再次进攻广大群众的利益。声明说，保守党人的房租法案将大大增加千百万租房住的人的房租，将用损害劳动人民利益的办法把两亿英镑塞进房主的口袋，并且将使很多租房住的人的居住毫无保障。
    政治委员会号召工人阶级进行斗争，反对进攻他们的权利，争取实现下列要求：立即提高工资和优抚金、提高对富翁的征税、争取完全就业、扩大东西方贸易、降低物价、把军费开支缩减一半、缩短兵役期到十二个月、在充分尊重埃及的主权和独立的基础上解决苏伊士运河问题、从塞浦路斯撤退英国军队、建立欧洲集体安全体系和从东西德撤退一切外国军队。
