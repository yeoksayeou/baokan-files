Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, 2nd – The design department of the Fuxin Mining Bureau has completed the designs for one hundred and twelve unit projects for next year's construction. These projects are all design items beyond this year's plan and additional tasks.

This design department completed the annual plan in six months and then completed the additional tasks in just over two months, from September to November 20th.

This year, the design tasks undertaken by the Fuxin Mining Bureau were more complex and heavier than in previous years. Most of them were major projects such as underground tunnel excavation, coal preparation, electromechanical installation, surface united welfare building, auxiliary shaft comprehensive factory building, and coal washing equipment. The workload increased by about 60% compared to last year.

In completing this year's design tasks, the designers launched a competition. They carefully arranged the progress schedule, bringing forward some design items that were originally planned to be completed in the second half of the year to the first half. In order to achieve good, fast, and economical results, they adopted more than 30 advanced design experiences during the design process. The use of 346 standard drawings and the repeated use of drawings alone saved 3,912 work hours. They learned the rapid drafting methods of the Shanghai and Shenyang design departments, reduced the drafting process, and increased efficiency by an average of 15% to 20%. Many designers also put forward rationalization proposals to reduce project costs. Based on the 32 projects that have already been implemented, construction investment was saved by 2.7 million yuan.

    阜新矿务局设计人员
　　多方想办法超额完成设计任务
    新华社阜新2日电　阜新矿务局设计处已经完成了明年施工的一百一十二件单位工程的设计。这些工程都是在今年计划和追加任务以外的设计项目。
    这个设计处用半年时间完成了全年计划，又在9月到11月20日两个多月中完成了追加任务。
    今年，阜新矿务局担负的设计任务比往年既复杂，又繁重。多是井下巷道掘进、发?、机电安装，地面上竖井联合福利大楼、副井综合厂房、选煤设备等主要工程，工程量比去年增加了60％左右。
    在完成今年设计任务中，设计人员展开了竞赛。他们仔细的安排了进度计划，把原来计划下半年里完成的一些设计项目，都提前到上半年。为了做到又好、又快、又省，在进行设计时，他们采用了三十多种先进设计经验。只是在采用三百四十六张标准图纸和重复使用图纸方面就节省了三千九百一十二个工时。他们学习了上海和沈阳设计部门的快速描图方法，缩减了描图工序，平均提高效率15％到20％。很多设计人员还提出了降低工程造价的合理化建议，仅就已经实现的三十二件计算，就使建设投资节省了二百七十万元。
