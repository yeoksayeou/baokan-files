    After Adopting Seedling Method,
　　Guangdong Ramie Planting Area Expanded Rapidly
    (Our report) The counties of Lechang, Lian, Huaiji, and Xinyi in Guangdong Province have successfully used seeds for large-scale ramie planting.
    In the past, ramie was planted in Guangdong by root division, with each mu only able to propagate fifteen mu, and it was prone to spreading ramie diseases. After switching to seed propagation, each mu of seedlings can supply four hundred mu of ramie fields for planting. Due to the rapid propagation of seedlings, the total ramie planting area in the province has rapidly increased from more than 10,000 mu last year to 70,000 mu this year. (Xiao Juncheng)

    采用种子育苗方法以后
　　广东苎麻种植面积迅速扩大
    本报讯　广东省乐昌、连县、怀集、信宜等县利用种子大量播种苎麻已经成功。
    过去，广东各地栽植苎麻都用分根方法，每亩只能繁殖十五亩，而且容易传播麻病。改用种子繁殖后，每亩麻苗可供四百亩麻田栽用。由于麻苗繁殖的快，今年全省苎麻种植面积由去年的一万多亩迅速增加到七万亩。（肖俊城）
