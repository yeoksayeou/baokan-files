    Improving the Current Book Supply Situation
    Currently, the books with relatively tight supplies include teaching reference books for universities and colleges, reference books for cadre theoretical study, some classics in economics and philosophy, and reference books such as the "Ciyuan" dictionary. The supply of these books is limited due to paper restrictions. Currently, local publishing houses have a relatively ample supply of paper. If overall planning and coordination can be implemented to save paper for printing books urgently needed by readers, and if the paper molds of certain publications can be handed over to local publishing houses for printing, then the current situation of supply falling short of demand can be greatly alleviated. This issue cannot be resolved by publishing or distribution departments alone and requires research and planning by cultural administrative departments.
    In addition, there is duplication of publication content. To cater to regional characteristics, it is necessary for central and local publishing houses, as well as publishing houses in various regions, to publish certain similar books. However, there is no need to publish three or four versions of some thriller novels.
    It is hoped that relevant departments will earnestly improve their work and change the current unreasonable phenomenon of serious stockpiling on one hand and long-term stock-outs on the other.

    改善目前图书供应状况
    目前供应比较紧张的书籍有大、中学校教学参考书，干部理论学习参考书，部分经济、哲学方面的经典著作，以及辞源等工具书。这些书籍因受纸张限制不能大量供应。目前，地方出版社纸张供应比较宽裕。如能通盘规划调度一下，节省出纸张来印读者迫切需要的书，并把某些出版物的纸型交给地方出版社去印，那么目前供不应求的情况就可大大缓和。这一问题不是出版或发行部门能解决的，需要文化行政部门来研究筹划。
    还有，出版物内容重复。为了照顾地区的特点，中央出版社和地方出版社之间以及各地出版社之间，出版某些同类的书也是必要的。但像一些惊险小说，就没有必要出版三、四种版本。
    希望有关部门认真地改进工作，改变目前这种一面严重积压，一面长期脱销的不合理现象。
