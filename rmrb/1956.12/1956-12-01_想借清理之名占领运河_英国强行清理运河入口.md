Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch from London: Despite the Egyptian government's repeated declarations that the Suez Canal would not be cleared before the withdrawal of British and French aggressor troops, the British government has forcibly "cleared" the canal entrance and is preparing to continue clearing the canal.

The British Admiralty announced on the 25th that Britain had removed the obstacles at the Suez Canal entrance at Port Said. On the evening of the 28th, the British Admiralty announced again that it had dispatched a large number of salvage vessels to help with the canal clearing work.

Britain and France had used the excuse of "clearing" the canal to refuse to withdraw their invading troops. The commander of the British and French naval task force occupying Port Said, British Admiral Forde Denford-Sclater, also stated at a press conference on the 25th that Britain and France intended to occupy the entire canal under the guise of "clearing" it. He said that their purpose was to complete a waterway all the way to that end of the canal. He even asked the "United Nations to find a way in this regard" so that they "could reach there." He also said that he could not say how long the "clearing" work would take.

　  想借清理之名占领运河
　  英国强行清理运河入口
    新华社29日讯　伦敦消息：尽管埃及政府一再声明在英法侵略军撤退以前不清理苏伊士运河，英国政府还是强行“清理”了运河入口，并准备继续清理运河。
    英国海军部在25日宣布，英国已经扫除了塞得港苏伊士运河入口处的障碍。28日晚上英国海军部又宣布，已经增派了大量打捞船只去帮助运河的清理工作。
    英法曾经借口要“清理”运河而不肯撤退它们的侵略军。占领塞得港的英法海军特遣舰队司令、英国海军上将福·登福德—斯累特25日在记者招待会上还表示，英法打算借“清理”之名占领整条运河。他说，他们的目的是要完成一条一直通到运河的那一端的水道。他甚至要求“联合国在这方面想办法”，使他们“能够到达那里”。他并且说，他无法说出“清理”工作要花多少时间。
