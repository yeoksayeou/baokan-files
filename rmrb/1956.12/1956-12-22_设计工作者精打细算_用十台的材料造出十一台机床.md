Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 21st: By calculating carefully in the design work, it is possible to use the metal materials for ten machine tools to build eleven machine tools. This is the conclusion reached by the designers of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant after summarizing their design experience of a grinding machine recently.
The designers of this factory modified the design of a Soviet-style 3151-type cylindrical grinding machine, starting from thinning the bed and table, reducing unnecessary parts, and replacing steel plates with cast iron for some minor parts that do not affect the performance of the grinding machine. This saved 356 kilograms of metal materials for this grinding machine, which weighs more than 3,500 kilograms in total. Recently, they further changed the design of the oil pump motor of this grinding machine. After analysis and research, the original 1.7 kilowatt motor can be replaced with a 0.6 kilowatt motor. This not only reduces the cost of this grinding machine, but also allows future users to save electricity. Calculated on the basis of an average of eight hours of use per day, each 3151-type cylindrical grinding machine can save more than 2,600 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year.
The new hydraulic equipment designed with the help of Soviet hydraulic equipment experts, which can be used on various grinding machines, has been adopted in a recently trial-produced cylindrical grinding machine. This newly designed hydraulic equipment weighs more than 70 kilograms less, has 35 fewer parts, saves 83 man-hours in manufacturing, and thus eliminates the quality defect of table crawling caused by the old design. If all the grinding machines produced next year are replaced with this new design, at least one million yuan or more can be saved in terms of materials and man-hours.
The designers of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant have increased their confidence in summarizing their design experience. The value of careful design and calculation will far exceed the value that can be saved by the processing workshop and other departments, and it can also save users more. At present, they are preparing to independently design a rotary table horizontal spindle surface grinding machine, which will adopt the suggestions of Soviet experts and be designed into a shaper-type structure. Its use and performance are the same as the Soviet Union's four-ton 3740-type horizontal spindle surface grinding machine, but the weight can be reduced to only one and a half to two tons.

### 设计工作者精打细算  用十台的材料造出十一台机床

    设计工作者精打细算
    用十台的材料造出十一台机床
    新华社上海21日电　在设计工作中精打细算，就有可能用十台机床的金属材料造出十一台机床。这是上海机床厂设计人员最近总结一种磨床的设计经验以后得出的结论。
    这个厂的设计人员修改了一种仿苏式三一五一型外圆磨床的设计，从改薄床身、台面，减少不必要的零件，以铸铁代替某些次要部分的钢板等不影响磨床性能的方面着手，使这种总重三千五百多公斤的磨床节省三百五十六公斤的金属材料。最近他们又进一步改变了这种磨床的油泵电动机的设计。经过分析研究，原来功率一点七瓩的电动机可以改用零点六瓩的电动机。这不仅降低了这种磨床的成本，而且可以使将来的用户节约用电。以每天平均使用八小时计算，每台三一五一型外圆磨床一年可以节约二千六百多度电。
    苏联液压设备专家帮助设计的能在各种磨床上通用的新液压设备，在最近试制的一种外圆磨床上已经采用。这种新设计的液压设备，体重减轻了七十多公斤，零件减少了三十五个，制造的工时节约了八十三小时，并且因此消灭了旧设计使台面爬行的质量缺陷。如果明年出产的磨床都换用这种新设计，材料、工时等方面至少可以节约一百万元以上。
    上海机床厂的设计人员在总结设计经验中增加了信心。精打细算的设计，节约的价值将远远超过加工车间和其他部门所可能节约的价值，而且可以使用户更多的节约。目前他们在准备自行设计一种圆台面卧轴平面磨床，它将采用苏联专家的建议，设计成牛头刨床式的结构。它的用途和性能同苏联的四吨重的三七四○型卧轴平面磨床一样，但是体重可以减轻到只有一吨半到二吨。
