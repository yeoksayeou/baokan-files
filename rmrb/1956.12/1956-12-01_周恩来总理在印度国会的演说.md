Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Indian Parliament

Honorable Mr. Deputy Speaker, Honorable Members of the People's House and the Federal House:

Thank you for your warm welcome. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak at the joint meeting of the People's House and the Federal House of the Republic of India. I believe this is a great honor not only for me personally but also for my country and my people. (Applause)

From this lofty podium, I would like to first convey, through you, to the great Indian people the cordial greetings and sincere respect of the Chinese people. The Chinese people wholeheartedly congratulate the Indian people on their prosperity and happiness.

In the summer of 1954, I had the opportunity to get my first acquaintance with your great country. Although my visit had to be very brief due to the ongoing Geneva Conference at the time, even just three days of stay left me with a very deep impression. The vastness and richness of your land, the richness and beauty of your culture, and, most importantly, the loyalty of your people to peace and their friendship towards China are all things that one cannot forget once seen. (Applause)

As a result of that visit, Prime Minister Nehru and I issued a joint statement proposing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence—Panchsheel—of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence to guide relations between the two countries, and expressing the hope that they could be applied to general international relations.

Now, as I return after two and a half years, we can be pleased to see that, based on the Five Principles, the friendship between China and India has developed considerably. Our economic and cultural ties have greatly increased, and our cooperation in maintaining peace has become closer. Exchanges of various delegations and individuals between the two countries are becoming more and more frequent. Here, I would like to especially mention that the Chinese government and people were very pleased to welcome Prime Minister Nehru in the winter of 1954. As the first visit to China by an Indian Prime Minister in history, it is undoubtedly a major event of historical significance in our bilateral relations. (Applause)

We can also be satisfied to see that the Five Principles, first initiated by the Prime Ministers of India and China two and a half years ago, have had a significant impact. They have been recognized by more and more countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe. At the Bandung Conference in April 1955, the twenty-nine participating Asian and African countries accepted the idea of the Five Principles and developed them into Ten Principles, formulating the "Declaration on the Promotion of World Peace and Cooperation."

I hope that my return visit to India can help further strengthen our cherished Sino-Indian friendship and our joint efforts for the cause of peace. (Applause)

Whenever we talk about Sino-Indian friendship, we often like to recall our long historical ties. Indeed, the relationship between China and India has set a rare example in world history. China and India are two large countries bordering each other for thousands of miles. At the dawn of history, we contributed our unique cultures to the world. For thousands of years, we have been mutually influencing each other, yet never interfering with each other. This long record of friendly coexistence of our ancestors naturally becomes a precious tradition for each of us today.

It is equally true that the relationship between our two countries was dimmed, stagnant, and even interrupted in modern times. However, this was not our fault, but because colonialism simultaneously placed shackles on us.

Great India, once the source of much of human wisdom, was reduced to a foreign colony for two hundred years. A little later, China was also subjected to colonial aggression. Although it nominally maintained a kind of independence, it was actually completely under foreign control.

The creativity of two great nations was suppressed. The course of their own historical development was forcibly interrupted, and the ties that had existed between them for many centuries were artificially severed. However, your people and our people did not willingly endure this situation. Oppression aroused resistance. Although the road was difficult, the struggle never ceased and finally achieved victory almost simultaneously. It is this victory that makes our meeting here today possible. (Applause)

Therefore, it goes without saying why there is such deep national sympathy between the Chinese and Indian people. The voice I heard when I first set foot on your land: "Hindi Chini bhai bhai" (Indians and Chinese are brothers) aptly expresses the feelings that fill our hearts today. (Applause)

The Chinese government and people will never forget the consistent and firm support that the Indian government and people have given us in our struggle for the complete unification of our motherland and in our struggle to restore China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. Similarly, the Indian government and people can rest assured that in your struggle to defend sovereignty and territorial integrity and to promote world peace, you will always have the full support of the Chinese government and people. (Applause)

Now, both China and India, having achieved political independence, are faced with the major task of nation-building. We both hope to enable our countries to get rid of their current backwardness and make contributions to the world commensurate with the history, territory, and population of our two countries.

In this regard, the paths and methods by which India and China achieved national independence are not exactly the same. The Chinese revolution was completed under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party through a long period of armed struggle. India took a different path. Some people have tried to use this difference to prove that the friendship between China and India is unfounded or unsustainable. However, this argument is completely untenable. The Chinese people deeply admire the struggles and achievements of the Indian people under the leadership of their national leaders Gandhi and Nehru. (Applause) We believe that it is entirely possible and necessary for the people of our two countries to emulate our ancestors, to respect each other's independent development, and to absorb what is beneficial to ourselves from each other's different experiences, so as to enrich our own experiences and seek our respective progress. Since our ancestors have done this in the past few thousand years, and have done it very well, why can't we do better today on a new basis?

Ladies and gentlemen, the countries we are now embarking on building are countries that have been oppressed for a long time and are backward in many respects. Because our economy is not yet independent, the living standards and cultural levels of the people are still not high. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the nationwide aspiration of the Chinese people is to achieve industrialization to change all this. We spent about three years completing the work of recovering the national economy from the destruction of long-term war. Then, in 1953, we started the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy. We hope to be able to basically build a complete industrial system in three five-year plan periods or a little longer. Now the first five-year plan will be completed next year. The second five-year plan is being drafted.

The Chinese people deeply know that to do a good job in construction, as Prime Minister Nehru said, "peace is an absolute necessity." For a long time, China has been deprived of the opportunity for construction because it has been constantly dragged into various wars by imperialists. It was not until after the victory of the Chinese revolution that China basically ended the civil war that had never stopped for many years and gained stability on the Chinese mainland. For the Chinese people, nothing is more precious than peace.

Of course, we demand peace not only out of the desire to build our country. We not only need peace now, but also will always need peace in the future, after China's construction has achieved success. As a result of the victory of the Chinese revolution, China has established a system that relies on the people, which is the people's democratic system. In China, it is absolutely impossible for a minority to incite wars that will inevitably cause harm to the majority; in China, no individual or group can hope to get rich and profit from war. On the contrary, the Chinese people know from their own and others' historical experiences that all aggressors will fail, and that any nation that oppresses others will not be free. Therefore, the Chinese people have clearly written in their constitution: "In international affairs, the unwavering policy of our country is to strive for the lofty goal of world peace and human progress." This is not only the policy that this generation of Chinese must follow, but also the policy that our future generations must follow. (Applause)

We are fortunate that it is not only China that demands peace. We are now in an era where peace has increasingly become the universal demand of the vast majority of humanity.

India, which gained independence almost at the same time as China, has emerged as a great force for maintaining peace in the world. The Chinese people highly appreciate India's efforts for the cause of peace. India has made valuable contributions to the peaceful settlement of both the Korean War and the Indochina War. India's role in establishing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and in initiating the first Asian-African Conference is well known. In addition, India has consistently pursued a policy favorable to peace on the issues of banning atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, and on the issue of disarmament. India is also making unremitting efforts to oppose hostile military blocs and promote collective peace. The Chinese people are proud to have India as a neighboring country. (Applause)

Not only the people of China and India, but also the 1.6 billion people of Asia and Africa all demand peace in the same way. The Bandung Conference has expressed this common desire very loudly.

The people of the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries, who are building their own countries under the banner of socialism together with China, have been striving for lasting peace. In other countries in Europe, America, and Australia, we can also see forces striving for peace. It can be said that the vast people of all countries in the world are unanimously demanding peace.

This situation could reasonably lead one to hope that in our time, humanity can be spared the tragedy of war. In fact, in the previous period, due to the continuous efforts of peace-loving countries and people, international tensions have definitely tended to ease. However, because the roots of war have not been eliminated and the forces of aggression still exist, the armed aggression against Egypt a month ago most nakedly exposed the hideous face of colonialists who do not hesitate to incite bloody wars to maintain their colonial interests.

Now, peace in Egypt cannot be considered to have been restored. Invading troops are still stationed on Egyptian territory, and Egyptian sovereignty has been violated. World peace, especially peace in Asia and Africa, is still under threat.

The cold facts show that the struggle against colonialism and to defend peace is a long-term and repeated struggle.

However, we can also be deeply convinced that colonialism cannot rely on temporary arrogance to save its doomed fate. The widespread indignation and resistance aroused by the aggression against Egypt show that colonialism is extremely isolated in today's world. If the people of India and China were able to achieve victory through persistent struggle when the forces of colonialism in the world seemed far stronger than they are today, we can also believe without a doubt that the Egyptian people, with the support of peace-loving forces around the world, will achieve final victory through persistent struggle.

Since the Suez Canal issue arose, the Indian government and the Indian people have consistently adopted a policy of firmly supporting Egypt in safeguarding its territorial integrity and sovereignty. India's efforts have repeatedly thwarted Western aggression plans and have been echoed by all peace-loving people.

The Chinese government and people approve of this just position of the Indian government and people. (Applause) China is willing to work with India to promote the complete withdrawal of invading troops from Egypt, to achieve true peace in Egypt, and to ensure that Egypt's independence and sovereignty are fully restored without any form of aggression or interference.

We believe that in the current situation, it is necessary to further strengthen the unity of peace-loving people around the world, especially the unity of the people of Asia and Africa who have become the targets of colonialist provocations. As we often say in China, "Unity is strength." Only unity can give us the strength to thwart the conspiracy to once again defeat the newly independent Asian and African countries one by one; only unity can give us the strength to eliminate the threat of war imposed on us.

In this regard, the unity of China and India will be of particularly great significance. The unity of the nearly one billion people of our two countries will be a huge, moral, and material force that will help stabilize the situation in Asia and Africa. (Applause)

We also believe that for the sake of unity, all peace-loving countries, especially China and India, as initiators of the Five Principles—Panchsheel—need to hold high the banner of the Five Principles even higher. When force is now being openly used again as a means of resolving international disputes, we should reaffirm our unwavering belief that all countries, regardless of their social systems and political systems, should abide by the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. History will prove that any attempt to violate the Five Principles and impose one's will on the other in modern international relations will ultimately not work. Only the implementation of the Five Principles can meet the needs of our time.

On the Chinese side, we are prepared to actively improve our relations with all countries, especially with our neighbors, on the basis of the Five Principles. (Applause)

Recently, we visited the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Cambodia, and we were greatly encouraged. We saw from these visits the strong will of the Vietnamese and Cambodian people to defend peace and maintain independence. We also saw from this the ardent desire of the people of these countries to strengthen the friendship between our countries in accordance with the Five Principles. Undoubtedly, this must also be the unanimous demand of the people of all Asian and African countries.

Ladies and gentlemen, the Bandung spirit has not withered away as some people had hoped. We have personally seen that it has taken deep root in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people. It has already begun to bear fruit, and it must grow and flourish even more.

Although our two countries, China and India, do not hold exactly the same views on all current international issues, these different views on individual issues cannot and should not obscure our common views on more and more important other issues. We believe that with the Five Principles and the Bandung spirit as our common starting point, we can solve the problems in our mutual relations, we can enhance our friendship and unity, and we can make more efforts for the cause of peace in Asia and the world. This will not only strengthen peace in the region where our two countries are located, but also set an example of peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation, and strengthen universal peace in the world. (Applause)

We deeply know that this is also the common attitude of our Indian friends and us. I hope that our cooperation in the cause of peace will be further strengthened.

As I am about to conclude my speech, I would like to once again express my deep gratitude for Prime Minister Nehru's invitation, for the warm hospitality of the Indian government, and for the warm welcome of the Indian people.

Long live the great Indian people! (Applause)

Long live the great friendship between the Chinese and Indian people! (Applause)

Long live the solidarity of the Asian and African people! (Applause)

Long live world peace! (Applause)

### 周恩来总理在印度国会的演说

1956-12-01
第2版()
专栏：

    周恩来总理在印度国会的演说尊敬的副议长先生：尊敬的人民院和联邦院的议员先生：
      感谢大家对我的热烈欢迎。感谢大家给我在印度共和国人民院和联邦院的联席会议上讲话的机会，我认为这不但是对我
  个人，而且是对我的国家和我的人民的极大荣誉。（鼓掌）
    在这个崇高的讲坛上，我愿意首先通过诸位向伟大的印度
  人民转达中国人民亲切的问候和诚挚的敬意。中国人民衷心地祝贺印度人民的繁荣幸福。
    1954年的夏天，我曾获有机会初次认识了你们伟大的国家。虽然当时由于日内瓦会议还在进行，我的访问不得不是极其短促的，但是，仅仅三天的逗留已经给我留下了极其深刻的印象。你们的土地的广大和富饶，你们的文化的丰富和优美，尤其重要的是，你们的人民对和平的忠诚和对中国的友情，都是一见就永远不能忘怀的。（鼓掌）
    作为那次访问的结果，尼赫鲁总理和我发表了一项联合声明，提出以互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处五项原则——潘查希拉——来指导两国之间的关系，并且希望它们能被应用到一般的国际关系中。
    现在，当我在过了两年半之后重来的时候，我们可以满意地看到：在五项原则的基础上，中国和印度的友谊已经有了长足的发展。我们在经济和文化上的联系大大增加了，我们在维护和平方面的合作更加密切了。两国之间各种代表团和个人的来往愈来愈频繁了。在这里，我要特别提到，中国政府和人民十分高兴能在1954年的冬天欢迎尼赫鲁总理。作为历史上第一个印度的总理到中国进行的访问，无疑是我们两国关系上一件具有历史意义的大事。（鼓掌）
    我们也可以满意地看到，两年半以前由印度和中国的总理首先倡议的五项原则已经产生了巨大的影响。它们受到了亚洲、非洲和欧洲越来越多的国家的承认。在1955年4月的万隆会议上，二十九个参加会议的亚洲和非洲国家，接受了五项原则的思想并且把它发展为十项原则，制定了“关于促进世界和平和合作的宣言”。
    我希望我到印度的再次访问在进一步加强我们如此珍贵的中印友谊和在我们共同为和平事业的努力方面，能够有所帮助。（鼓掌）
    每当我们谈到中印友谊的时候，我们往往喜欢回忆我们之间悠久的历史性联系。的确，中国和印度的关系在世界历史上树立了一个罕见的范例。中国和印度是接壤数千里的两个大国，在历史的黎明时期，我们就给世界贡献了自己独特的文化，几千年来，我们一直互相接受影响，然而从来没有彼此干扰。我们的先人这种长期友好相处的记录，在今天自然地成为值得我们每一个人珍贵的传统。
    同样真实的是，我们两国之间的关系在近代是暗淡了、停滞了、甚至中断了。然而这并不是我们的过错，而是因为殖民主义在我们身上同时加上了枷锁的缘故。
    伟大的印度，曾经是人类许多智慧的渊源的印度，有两百年沉沦为外国的殖民地。稍后一点，中国也受到了殖民主义的侵略，虽然多少保存着一种名义上的独立，实际上也完全处在外国的宰割之下。
    两个伟大的民族的创造力受到了压抑。它们自己的历史发展的进程被迫中断了，它们之间许多世纪以来存在的联系被人为地割断了。然而，你们的人民，我们的人民，都并没有甘心忍受这种情况。压迫引起了反抗，尽管道路是艰难的，斗争从来没有停息过，而且终于差不多在同时取得了胜利。就是这个胜利使我们今天在这里的会面成为可能。（鼓掌）
    因此，无需解释就可以了解，为什么中国人民和印度人民之间会具有如此深厚的民族同情。当我第一次踏上你们的土地就听到的声音：“印地秦尼巴依巴依”（印中人民是兄弟），恰当地表达了今天充塞在我们心里的感情。（鼓掌）
    中国政府和人民永远不会忘记，在我们为祖国的完全统一而进行的斗争中，在我们为恢复中国在联合国的合法权利的斗争中，印度政府和印度人民所给予我们的一贯的、坚决的支持。同样，印度政府和印度人民也可以相信，在你们为保卫主权和领土完整和促进世界和平的斗争中，会永远得到中国政府和中国人民全力的支持。（鼓掌）
    现在，在已经取得了政治上的独立的中国和印度面前，都摆着建设国家的重大任务。我们都希望使我们的国家能够摆脱现在的落后状态，并且对世界作出同我们两国的历史、幅员、人口相称的贡献。
    在这方面，印度和中国取得民族独立的道路和方法是不完全相同的。中国的革命是在中国共产党的领导下，经过长期的武装斗争而完成的。印度采取的是另外一条道路。有人就企图利用这种不同来证明中国和印度的友谊是没有基础的或不能持久的。然而，这种论据是完全不能成立的。中国人民极其敬仰印度人民在自己的民族领袖甘地和尼赫鲁的领导下所进行的斗争和取得的成就。（鼓掌）我们认为，我们两国人民完全可能，并且应当效法自己的先人，对彼此的独立发展互相尊重，并且从彼此不同的经验中，吸收对自己有益的东西，转而丰富自己的经验，以求得各自的进步。既然我们的先人在过去几千
  年中已经这样做了，而且做得很好，为什么我们今天不能在新
  的基础上做得更好呢？
      女士们、先生们，我们现在正在着手建设的国家是一个长期受压迫而在许多方面都是落后的国家。由于我们的经济还不是独立的，人民的生活水平和文化水平还是不高的。在中华人民共和国成立以后，中国的全民愿望就是实现工业化，来改变这一切。我们花了三年左右的时间完成了把国民经济从长期战争的破坏中恢复过来的工作。然后，就在1953年开始了发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。我们希望能够在三个五年计划时期或者更多一点时期内，基本上建成一个完整的工业体系。现在第一个五年计划将在明年完成。第二个五年计划正在着手拟制。
      中国人民深深知道，要搞好建设，就像尼赫鲁总理所说的，
  “和平是一种绝对的必需品”。长期以来，中国就因为不断被帝国主义者拖入各种各样的战争而被剥夺了建设的机会。直到中国革命胜利以后，中国才在基本上结束了多年以来从来没有停止过的内战而获得了中国大陆的安定。对中国人民来说，没有比和平更可贵的了。
      当然，我们要求和平还不仅仅是出于要建设国家的愿望。我们不但在现在需要和平，就是在将来，在中国建设获有成就以后，也永远需要和平。作为中国革命胜利的结果，中国已经建立了依靠人民的制度，这就是人民民主制度。在中国，少数人决没有可能挑动必然会给大多数人造成祸害的战争；在中国，也决没有任何个人或者集团可以希望从战争中发财谋利。相反，中国人民从自己的和别人的历史经验中知道，凡是侵略者都是要失败的，凡是压迫别人的民族本身是不会得到自由的。因此，中国人民在自己的宪法上明确地写着：“在国际事务中，我国坚定不移的方针是为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力。”这不仅是我们这一代中国人所必须遵循的方针，而且也是我们后代子孙所必须遵循的方针。（鼓掌）
    我们感到庆幸的是，并不只是中国一个国家要求和平。我们现在正处在和平已经日益成为绝大多数人类的普遍要求的时代。
    同中国几乎是同时获得独立的印度已经作为维护和平的一支巨大力量出现在世界上。印度对和平事业的努力受到了中国人民极高的评价。无论是朝鲜战争还是印度支那战争的和平解决，印度都作了十分可贵的贡献。印度在确立和平共处的五项原则方面，在发起第一次亚非会议方面的作用是尽人皆知的。此外，在禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的问题上，在裁军问题上，印度都一贯坚定地执行着有利于和平的政策。在反对敌对性的军事集团和促进集体和平方面，印度也在进行着不懈的努力。中国人民以有印度这样的邻邦而引以为荣。（鼓掌）
    不但是中国和印度的人民，而且是整个亚洲和非洲的十六亿人民都同样地要求和平，万隆会议已经十分响亮地表达了这种共同的愿望。
    同中国一起在社会主义的旗帜下建设自己的国家的苏联和各人民民主国家的人民一直为争取持久和平而奋斗。在欧洲、美洲和澳洲的其他国家，我们同样可以看到为和平而奋斗的力量。可以说，世界各国的广大人民都是一致要求和平的。
    这种情况本来可以使人合理地希望，在我们的时代可以使人类免于重遭战争的惨祸。事实上，在前一个时期，由于爱好和平的国家和人民的不断努力，国际紧张局势已经肯定地趋向和缓。但是，由于战争的根源并未消除，侵略的势力依然存在，一个月以前对埃及发动的武装侵略最赤裸裸地暴露了殖民主义者不惜挑动血腥的战争来维护自己的殖民利益的狰狞面目。
    现在，埃及的和平还不能认为已经恢复，埃及的领土上还驻扎着入侵的军队，埃及的主权受到了侵犯。全世界的和平，首先是亚洲和非洲的和平，还处在威胁之下。
    冷酷的事实说明，反对殖民主义、保卫和平的斗争是一个长期的、反复的斗争。
    但是，我们也可以深信不疑，殖民主义要依靠一时的嚣张挽救它注定要失败的命运是办不到的。对埃及的侵略所激起的广泛的义愤和反抗说明，殖民主义在今天的世界上是极其孤立的。如果当殖民主义的力量在世界上还显得远比今天为强大的时候，印度和中国的人民尚且能以坚持的斗争取得了胜利，我们也可以毫无怀疑地相信，得到全世界爱好和平的力量的支持的埃及人民，经过坚持的斗争，一定会取得最后的胜利。
    自从苏伊士运河问题发生以来，印度政府和印度人民一贯采取了坚决支持埃及维护领土完整和主权的政策。印度的努力曾经一再打击了西方的侵略计划，并且取得了一切爱好和平的人民的响应。
    中国政府和人民赞成印度政府和人民这种正义立场。（鼓掌）中国愿同印度共同努力，来促使入侵军队完全撤出埃及，使埃及实现真正的和平，使埃及的独立和主权得到完全的恢复而不受到任何形式的侵略和干涉。
    我们认为，在目前的形势下，有必要进一步加强全世界爱好和平的人民的团结，尤其是已经成为殖民主义挑衅对象的亚洲和非洲的人民的团结。像我们在中国所常说的那样，“团结就是力量”。只有团结，才能使我们有力量挫败那种企图再次把新近获得独立的亚非国家重新予以各个击破的阴谋；只有团结，才能使我们有力量消除那种强加在我们头上的战争威胁。
    在这方面，中国和印度的团结将具有特别重大的意义。我们两国将近十亿人民的团结将是有助于稳定亚非地区局势的一个巨大的、道义的和物质的力量。（鼓掌）
    我们还认为，为了团结的利益，一切爱好和平的国家，首先是作为五项原则——潘查希拉——倡议国的中国和印度，有必要更高地举起五项原则的旗帜。当现在武力又被公然使用来作为解决国际争端的手段的时候，应当重申我们坚定不移的信念：一切国家，不问其社会制度和政治制度的不同，都应当遵守互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的原则。历史将要证明：一切违反五项原则，企图把一方的意志强加给另一方的做法，在现代的国际关系中，最后都会是行不通的。只有实行五项原则，才能符合我们时代的要求。
    在中国这方面，我们准备在五项原则的基础上积极地改进我们同一切国家的关系，首先是同我们邻邦的关系。（鼓掌）
    最近我们访问了越南民主共和国和柬埔寨王国，我们得到了极大的鼓舞。我们从这些访问中看到了越南人民和柬埔寨人民保卫和平、维护独立的坚强意志。我们也从这里面看到了这些国家的人民要求根据五项原则加强我们各国之间的友谊的炽烈的愿望。毫无疑问，这也一定是所有亚非国家的人民的一致要求。
    女士们、先生们，万隆精神并没有像有些人希望的那样萎谢下去，我们亲自看到它已经在亿万人民的心里深深地扎下了根子，它已经在开始结果，而且还一定要更加繁荣滋长。
    我们中印两国虽然并不是对于目前所有国际问题都抱着完全相同的看法，但是这些对于个别问题的不同看法，不能而且也不应该掩盖我们对于更多和更重要的其他问题的共同见解。我们相信，以五项原则，以万隆精神作为我们共同的出发点，我们就可以解决我们相互关系上的问题，就可以增进我们之间的友谊和团结，就可以使我们为亚洲和世界和平的事业作出更多的努力。这样不但可以在我们两国所在的地区加强和平，而且也可以树立一种和平共处、友好合作的范例，加强世界上普遍的和平。（鼓掌）
    我们深知这也是我们的印度朋友们和我们的共同态度。我愿我们在和平事业中的合作进一步加强。
    在我将要结束我的讲话的时候，我愿意再次表示深深的谢意，感谢尼赫鲁总理的邀请，感谢印度政府对我们的盛情款待，感谢印度人民的热烈欢迎。
    伟大的印度人民万岁！（鼓掌）
    中国和印度两国人民的伟大友谊万岁！（鼓掌）
    亚非人民的团结万岁！（鼓掌）
    世界和平万岁！（鼓掌）
