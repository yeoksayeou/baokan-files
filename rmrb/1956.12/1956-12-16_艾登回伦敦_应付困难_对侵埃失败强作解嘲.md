Xinhua News Agency, London, December 15th: British Prime Minister Eden returned to London on the 14th after a three-week "vacation" in Jamaica. At a press conference held at the airport, he said that after his return, he would continue as Prime Minister to "maintain a united government to deal with those domestic and foreign difficulties that we know lie ahead."

Eden, according to his own view, explained the result of the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, saying, "If it were not for the actions of Britain and France, who would have expected a United Nations force?" He said that this might become a turning point in the history of the United Nations.

    艾登回伦敦“应付困难”
    对侵埃失败强作解嘲
    据新华社15日讯　伦敦消息：英国首相艾登在牙买加“休假”三个星期以后，在14日回到伦敦。他在飞机场举行的记者招待会上说，他回来以后将继续作为首相“保持一个团结一致的政府来应付那些我们所知道的摆在前面的国内和国外的困难”。
    艾登按照他的见解解释了英法侵略埃及的结果，他说，“如果不是英国和法国的行动的话，谁会料想到会有一支联合国部队呢？”他说这可能成为联合国历史上的一个转折点。
