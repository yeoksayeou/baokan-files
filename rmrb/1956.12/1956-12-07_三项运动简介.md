　　Introduction to Three Sports

　　Boxing
    Boxing is a highly combative sport. It can cultivate people's excellent qualities such as courage, perseverance, and resourcefulness. Competitions are held in ten weight classes according to the different weights of the athletes (this time only five classes from flyweight to light middleweight will be held). During the competition, athletes wear gloves made of soft thin leather filled with cotton wool on their hands and compete in a five-meter square ring surrounded by ropes. Legal attack areas are the front chest and abdomen above the waist and the face of the opponent. A formal match consists of three rounds, each lasting three minutes (this time it is stipulated that each round is two minutes), with a one-minute break between each round. The referee determines the winner based on the skills and sportsmanship of both sides.

　　Fencing
    Fencing, like boxing, is an international competitive sport. Fencers must undergo good physical and moral training, and they are divided into three groups according to age: junior, youth, and adult. Both competitors must wear protective clothing, masks, and leather gloves. There are four types of swords: foil, epee, saber, and carbine. Women can only participate in the foil event (this competition only includes foil and epee). The valid target area for the foil is from the waist up to the collarbone, for women's foil and carbine it is above the thigh; the epee can also attack the head; the whole body can be attacked with the saber. Except for the epee, the other three swords are only allowed to use thrusting movements during the competition, and chopping movements are not allowed. The competition takes place in a field that is twenty-four meters long and two meters wide (the foil field is twelve meters long). There are time limits and number of thrusts (chops) limits for each match. If one side reaches the prescribed number of thrusts (chops) within the time limit, the referee will judge the winner as the one with fewer thrusts (chops) against them.

　　Acrobatic Gymnastics
    Acrobatic gymnastics involves performing skills such as rolling and handstands on a mat, requiring a high degree of skill and agility. Acrobatic gymnastics includes single, double, mixed doubles, and group routines. The competition method is similar to that of free gymnastics. Acrobatic gymnastics is of great significance for developing a person's coordination of movements and improving athletic skills and general physical training levels.

　　三项运动简介
　　拳击
    拳击是战斗性很强的一种运动。能培养人的勇敢、坚毅、机智等优良品质。比赛是按运动员不同体重分十级进行（这次只举行次最轻级到轻中级的五级比赛）。运动员在比赛时，双手戴上在柔软薄皮里面装有棉毛物的手套，在一个四周有围绳的五公尺见方场内进行比赛。合法攻击部位是对方腰以上正面的胸腹部和面部。正式比赛分三局，每局三分钟（这次规定每局两分钟），每局中间休息一分钟。裁判员根据双方的技术和体育道德作风来评定胜负。
　　击剑
    击剑同拳击一样，也是国际竞赛的运动项目。击剑运动员在身体上和道德上都要受很好的训练，他们按年龄分少年、青年和成年三组。比赛双方必须身穿防护服装，戴面具和皮手套。剑有轻剑、花式剑、重剑和卡宾枪四种，女子只能参加轻剑一种（这次比赛只有轻剑和花式剑）。合理攻击部位，轻剑是腰部以上到锁骨处，女子轻剑和卡宾枪是大腿以上；花式剑还可以攻击头部；重剑全身都可以攻击。除了花式剑以外，其它三种剑在比赛时只许用刺的动作，不许用劈的动作。比赛在二十四公尺长、二公尺宽的场内进行（轻剑场地长十二公尺）。每场比赛时间和刺（劈）次数都有限定，在限定时间内，有一方达到规定的刺（劈）次数时，裁判员判被刺（劈）中次数少的获胜。
　　技巧运动
    技巧运动就是在垫子上作滚翻、倒立等技巧性、灵敏性较强的动作。技巧运动分单人、双人、男女混合双人和团体等动作。比赛方法同自由体操的比赛方法相似。技巧运动对发展人的动作的协调性、对提高运动技巧和一般身体训练水平都有着很大意义。
