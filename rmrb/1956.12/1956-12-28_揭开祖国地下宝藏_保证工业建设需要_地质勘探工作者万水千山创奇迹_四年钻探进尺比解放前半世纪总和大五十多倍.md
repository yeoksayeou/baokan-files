Xinhua News Agency, December 27th. The exploration plan for major mineral reserves stipulated in China's First Five-Year Plan has been completed one year ahead of schedule, with the exception of a few mineral types. The mineral resources needed for new enterprises during the First Five-Year Plan have been guaranteed, and they also partially meet the needs of new enterprises during the Second Five-Year Plan.

According to data from the State Statistical Bureau, the main mineral types that have exceeded the storage target of the First Five-Year Plan to date include iron, natural petroleum, manganese, copper, lead, tungsten, phosphorus, oil shale, natural gas, pyrite, and magnesite. The Five-Year Plan stipulated that 2.47 billion tons of iron ore should be proven. From 1953 to date, 3.44 billion tons have been proven, exceeding the original plan by 39%. The Five-Year Plan stipulated that 55.18 million tons of natural petroleum reserves should be proven. In four years, the proven reserves have exceeded more than double the Five-Year Plan reserves. The Five-Year Plan for coal and tin reserves is nearing completion. It is expected that these mineral types may complete the Five-Year Plan for reserves ahead of schedule next year.

From 1953 to date, the iron ore reserves proven by geological prospecting personnel in China, calculated based on China's annual production of 11 million tons of iron, can be mined for more than 100 years. The proven coal reserves, calculated based on an annual output of 200 million tons, can be mined for more than 60 years. In the past four years, they have provided mineral resource data for more than 80 pairs of coal mine shafts, a group of new iron and steel enterprises including Baotou and Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprises, non-ferrous metal enterprises, and many other enterprises, creating conditions for the construction of these enterprises.

During the first four years of the First Five-Year Plan, China's geological prospecting personnel conducted unprecedented exploration and prospecting work in hundreds of mining areas across the country and many remote areas. They overcame harsh climates and the difficulties of inconvenient transportation, water shortages, and insufficient material supplies. The total drilling footage completed in four years reached 8.35 million meters, greatly exceeding the total drilling footage in the first half-century after China's liberation. From 1907, when geological work began in China, to 1949, the cumulative drilling footage was less than 150,000 meters.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, China's geological prospecting team experienced rapid development. Currently, the number of geological prospecting personnel nationwide has increased by about eight times compared to 1952. The technical equipment owned by China's geological prospecting personnel has also greatly increased, with more than 30 times the number of mechanical core drilling rigs compared to before liberation.

In recent years, with the increase in technical equipment and the widespread application of many advanced exploration technologies, the technical level of geological prospecting in China has also greatly improved. According to statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, the average drilling speed of each mechanical core drilling rig in China has reached 165 meters per month, more than double that of 1952. Among them, the exploration team under the Ministry of Petroleum Industry averaged more than 300 meters per drilling rig per month this year. One-third of the drilling rigs of the exploration team under the Ministry of Geology have monthly drilling efficiency exceeding 200 meters, and the core recovery rate has reached 80%.

Xinhua News Agency, December 27th. According to statistics from relevant departments, geological prospecting personnel in China discovered more than 80 mineral sites with important economic value this year, more than 30 of which are expected to be transferred to exploration next year in order to provide design data for the development of these mineral sites.

More than a dozen of the new mineral sites are iron mines; the iron mines found in Hubei, Shanxi, Sichuan, Guangdong, and other provinces have abundant reserves. A large iron mine located in eastern Guangdong Province has a maximum ore body thickness of 200 meters and a minimum thickness of 36 meters, containing about 40% iron. Two large iron mines located in western Hubei Province are not only abundant in reserves, containing 40% to 50% iron, but also contain calcium, which can be directly loaded into blast furnaces for ironmaking.

Several manganese mine sites have been discovered this year in Guangxi, Hunan, and other provinces. The two manganese mine sites found in Guangxi are relatively large in scale and have mining value. Manganese is one of the important raw materials for steelmaking.

Geological prospecting personnel in China discovered more than 30 copper, lead, zinc, tin, molybdenum, tungsten, and other mineral deposits this year. Copper mines with large reserves have been found in Jiangxi, Gansu, Yunnan, and other provinces. Lead deposits with promising prospects have been found in Jilin, Guizhou, and other provinces. Molybdenum deposits with abundant reserves have been found in Shaanxi Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, further proving that China is a country with abundant molybdenum.

More than a dozen larger coal mine sites have been found this year. Several coking coal sites with large reserves have been discovered in Sichuan, Yunnan, and other provinces. Together with past discoveries, the amount of coal for the iron and steel industry in the Southwest region is initially guaranteed. Two coalfields have been found in Qinghai, Xinjiang, and other places, with preliminary estimates of over one billion tons each. One of the coalfields located in the Xinjiang region has a coal seam thickness of about 60 meters. The coal in these two regions can be coked.

This year, geological prospecting personnel have found phosphate deposits in Hubei, Hunan, Yunnan, Gansu, and other regions. The phosphate mine found in Hubei Province has large reserves and has great mining value.

    揭开祖国地下宝藏　保证工业建设需要
    地质勘探工作者万水千山创奇迹
    四年钻探进尺比解放前半世纪总和大五十多倍
    新华社27日讯　我国第一个五年计划规定的主要矿产储量勘探计划，除个别矿种以外已经提前一年完成。第一个五年计划新建企业所需要的矿产资源已经有了保证，同时还部分地满足了第二个五年计划新建企业所需要的矿产资源。
    据国家统计局的资料，到目前为止已经超额完成第一个五年计划储量指标的主要矿种，有铁、天然石油、锰、铜、铅、钨、磷、油页岩、天然气、黄铁矿、菱镁矿等。五年计划规定要探明铁矿二十四亿七千万吨，从1953年到目前为止已经探明三十四亿四千万吨，超过原计划39％。五年计划规定要探明天然石油储量五千五百一十八万吨、四年里，已经探得的储量超过五年计划储量一倍以上。煤、锡等矿种的五年储量计划已经接近完成。预计这几种矿种可能在明年提前完成五年储量计划。
    从1953年到目前为止，我国地质勘探人员探明的铁矿储量，按我国每年生产铁一千一百万吨计算，可以开采一百多年；已经探明的煤矿按年产两亿吨计算，可以开采六十多年。在过去四年里，他们已经为八十多对煤矿矿井，一批包括包头、武汉钢铁联合企业在内的新的钢铁企业和有色金属企业，以及其他许多企业，提供了矿产资源资料，为建设这些企业创造了条件。
    在第一个五年计划前四年里，我国地质勘探人员在全国几百个矿区和许多人迹罕到的地区，进行了空前规模的勘探和普查找矿工作。他们战胜了恶劣的气候，克服了交通不便、缺水和物质供应不足的困难。四年里完成的钻探进尺共达八百三十五万公尺，大大超过了我国解放前半个世纪的钻探进尺的总和。我国从有地质工作的1907年起到1949年为止，累计钻探进尺不到十五万公尺。
    第一个五年计划期间，我国地质勘探队伍有了飞跃的发展。目前，全国地质勘探人员比1952年增加了八倍左右。我国地质勘探人员所拥有的技术装备也大大增加，其中机械岩心钻机比解放前增加了三十多倍。
    几年来，随着技术装备的增加和许多先进的勘探技术的广泛应用，我国地质勘探技术水平也有了很大提高。据国家统计局统计，我国机械岩心钻探每台钻机钻进速度平均每月达到一百六十五公尺，比1952年提高一倍多，其中石油工业部所属勘探队今年平均每台钻机每月钻进三百多公尺；地质部所属勘探队今年有三分之一的钻机每月钻进效率超过二百公尺，岩心采取率达到80％。
    新华社27日讯　据有关部门统计，我国地质普查人员今年发现了八十多个有重要经济价值的矿产地，其中有三十多个预计可以在明年转入勘探，以便提供开发这些矿产地的设计资料。
    新矿产地中有十几个是铁矿；其中在湖北、山西、四川、广东等省内找到的铁矿，储量都很丰富。位于广东省东部的一个大铁矿，矿体最厚的达二百公尺，最薄的三十六公尺，含铁40％左右。位于湖北西部的两个大铁矿，不但储量丰富，含铁40％到50％，而且含有钙质，可以直接装入高炉炼铁。
    今年在广西、湖南等省内发现了几个锰矿产地。在广西找到的两个锰矿产地规模较大，有开采价值。锰是炼制钢铁的重要原料之一。
    我国地质普查人员今年发现的铜、铅、锌、锡、钼、钨等矿产的产地共有三十多个。在江西、甘肃、云南等省找到了储量较大的铜矿；在吉林、贵州等省找到了有远景希望的铅产地；在陕西省和内蒙古自治区等地，找到了储量丰富的钼产地，进一步证明我国是一个多钼的国家。
    今年找到的较大的煤矿产地有十多个。在四川、云南等省发现了几处储量较大的炼焦煤产地，连同过去的发现，西南地区钢铁工业用煤在数量上初步有了保证。在青海、新疆等地找到了两个煤田，初步估计每个储量在十亿吨以上，其中位于新疆地区的一个煤田，煤层厚达六十公尺左右。这两个地区的煤都可以炼焦。
    地质普查人员今年在湖北、湖南、云南、甘肃等地区，找到了磷矿产地；其中在湖北省内找到的磷矿，储量较大，具有较大的开采价值。
