Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Morawski, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, spoke at the Third Congress of the Polish Journalists Association, discussing the current tasks of Polish journalists and newspapers.

The Polish Journalists' Congress was held in Warsaw from November 30 to December 2.

Morawski said: "The joint Polish-Soviet statement of November 18 is a consolidation and sincere development of the friendship between Poland and the Soviet Union, a friendship and alliance that is needed by both sides, but is even more important for Poland." Morawski said, "However, some articles in our newspapers wrote the results of the Polish-Soviet negotiations as if they were a unilateral victory for Poland. In reality, the results of this negotiation were a victory for both sides. Some of our commentators did not point out that the correct socialist principles were already reflected in the negotiations, and did not indicate that the Soviet leadership, like us, had the desire to eliminate the deviations left in our relations during the Stalin era."

**Oppose Great-Power Chauvinism, But Also Oppose Nationalism and Anti-Soviet Tendencies**

Morawski said: "As for opposing great-power chauvinism, the CPSU Central Committee already pointed this out at its plenary session in July 1955, and it was also pointed out at the Twentieth Congress. The Soviet government also issued a declaration on October 30.

"But everyone should realize that to carry out an effective struggle, it is necessary to oppose nationalism and anti-Soviet tendencies while opposing great-power chauvinism, and to carry out both struggles. But we have such journalists who have stirred up a wave of nationalism, distorted and damaged the true patriotism of the Polish people, and seized the clear attention of the people. This is related to the most vital interests of the international workers' movement and the Polish workers' movement. Because all progressive forces cannot develop if they do not get rid of nationalism."

Morawski pointed out that the Chinese and Italian Communist Parties had sympathy for us from the beginning. The Yugoslav Party also sympathized with us. He said that they expressed their support and recognition for our efforts. At the same time, some activists and leaders of parties in some countries expressed disbelief in us. It is permissible to discuss issues with foreign comrades in the newspapers, if someone there has distorted the facts or incorrectly discussed our policies. But this discussion can only be in a truly persuasive manner with our foreign comrades. The discussions in our newspapers should not be didactic, and offensive articles are not allowed to be published. Stirring up and intensifying struggles in the international workers' movement and among the communist parties of various countries is not in our interests, and it is detrimental to Poland and socialism.

**Party Newspapers Should Embody the Leading Role of the Party**

In talking about the great people's movement and patriotism, Morawski pointed out: the people's efforts and feelings should be linked with the task of building socialism. This requires a basic and decisive condition, namely the leading role of the Party and Communists in all aspects of life. Without the Communists, or if the Communists do not lead the people's efforts, there would be no October Revolution. Unfortunately, many Party organizations are not good at embodying the Party's leading role, and Party newspapers have not done this either. The newspapers have not powerfully pointed out that no one and no political force other than our Party can achieve this result. Any other policies and methods would push us into this or that destructive people's tragedy.

**Freedom of the Press Should Conform to the Interests of Socialism**

Morawski said: What we want is socialist democracy, not any other kind of democracy. The boundary of our democratization is within the scope of the interests of socialist construction. Everything that is harmful to this interest is not allowed to exist in our democracy. The same can be said about the freedom of the press. Some people say that the Party advocates freedom of the press, and that one day in socialism there will no longer be any restrictions on freedom of speech and the press, but these people forget that there are forces acting against socialism both at home and abroad, and forget that these forces will not stop in the most brutal struggle, and they try to shake socialist countries and the labor of the people. So far, restrictions are still necessary. It is impossible not to take such restrictions. Some people say that many Party organizations are cultivated in the old working methods, and they have not yet learned and mastered the new methods of political and ideological struggle against the enemy, so, has the press helped these Party organizations? The press has not conducted discussions on this, and the press has not pointed out right-leaning views, bourgeois views, and other views. The struggle within the Party against those conservative elements who attempt to restore the old ways has not yet ended, but our newspapers criticize all state organs and public security organs without analysis. This is not isolating the conservative elements, but indiscriminately negating everything.

**People Are Unwilling to Just Repeat Criticisms of the Past; While Criticizing, They Must Put Forward Improvement Suggestions**

Morawski said that it is necessary to launch a political struggle on the entire front against the reactionary forces of society and expose their attempts to oppose socialism. The newspapers should carry out uninterrupted work in order to unite the masses around the program of the Eighth Plenary Session and mobilize the people to work and strive. People are unwilling to just repeat criticisms of the past. While criticizing, the newspapers should also point out how to do better. The general election is coming soon. In the election campaign, our newspapers must politically and ideologically arm our activists, popularize and publicize the election program, explain the Party's policies, and defend the Party's policies in the face of various enemies and agitators.

Morawski said that despite the changes that have taken place in our lives, people are still dissatisfied with the difficult living conditions. Many workers' representatives have put forward various demands to the Central Committee, many of which are legitimate demands. It should be made clear to everyone that in order to meet these demands, it is necessary to produce more and save more first. Newspapers should dare to express their views, explain those legitimate demands that the government cannot currently meet, and oppose those illegitimate demands.

    莫拉夫斯基谈波兰新闻工作的当前任务
    对反动势力的整个战线展开政治斗争
    新华社讯　波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局委员莫拉夫斯基在波兰新闻工作者协会第三届代表大会上讲了话，谈到了波兰新闻工作者和报刊在当前的任务。
    波兰新闻工作者的这次代表大会是从11月30日到12月2日在华沙举行的。
    莫拉夫斯基说：“11月18日波苏联合声明是波苏之间的巩固、诚挚友谊的发展，这种友谊和联盟是双方都需要的，但是对波兰更为重要。”莫拉夫斯基说：“但是，在我们报刊上的某些文章里却把波苏谈判的结果写成好像是波兰单方面的胜利，实际上这次谈判的结果是双方的胜利，我们有些评论家没有指出在谈判中就已经体现了正确的社会主义的原则，没有指明苏联领导上也同我们一样具有消除斯大林时期在我们关系中留下的偏差的愿望。”
    要反对大国沙文主义，也要反对民族主义和反苏倾向
    莫拉夫斯基说：“至于应该反对大国主义，苏共在1955年7月中央全会上就已经指出了，在第二十次代表大会上又曾经指出这一点，苏联政府还在10月30日发表了宣言。
    “但是每个人都应该认识到，要进行有效的斗争，在反对大国沙文主义的同时也要反对民族主义、反对反苏倾向，要进行这两种斗争。可是我们有这样的新闻工作者，他们掀起了民族主义的浪潮，曲解和损害了波兰人民真正的爱国主义，夺取了人民清醒的注意力。这关系着国际工人运动和波兰工人运动的最切身的利益。因为一切进步势力如果不摆脱民族主义，就不能够获得发展。”
    莫拉夫斯基指出，中国和意大利共产党从一开始就对我们有着同情。南斯拉夫党也同情我们。他说，他们对我们的努力表示支持和承认。同时，有些国家的党的活动家和领导者对我们表示不相信。在报刊上同外国同志讨论问题是可以的，假如那里有人歪曲了事实或错误地论述了我们的政策的话。但是这种讨论只能是对我们的外国同志采取真正说服的方式。我们报刊上的讨论不能教训人，不允许刊载攻击性的文章。在国际工人运动中和各国共产党中激起和加剧斗争不符合我们的利益，这对波兰和社会主义都是不利的。
    党的报刊应该体现党的领导作用
    在谈到巨大的人民运动和爱国主义的时候，莫拉夫斯基指出：应该把人民这种努力和感觉同建设社会主义的任务联系起来。这要有一个基本的决定性的条件，即党和共产党人在一切生活中的领导作用。如果没有共产党人，或者共产党人不来领导人民的努力，那就不会有十月。可惜的是许多党的组织不善于体现党的领导作用，党的报刊也没有作到这一点。报刊没有有力地指出，除了我们党以外，任何人和任何政治势力都不能取得这种成果。任何其他的政策和方法都会把我们推到这种或那种毁灭性的人民的悲剧里去。
    报刊的自由应符合社会主义的利益
    莫拉夫斯基说：我们要的是社会主义民主，而不是任何其他的民主。我们民主化的界线是在社会主义建设的利益范围之内。一切有害于这种利益的东西都不容许在我们的民主里存在。关于报刊的自由也可以这样说。有人说党主张报刊自由，有一天在社会主义中将不再有对言论和报刊自由的任何限制，但是这些人忘记了在我们国内和国外都有着反对社会主义的力量在行动，忘记了这些力量在最残酷的斗争中也不会停止，它们力图动摇社会主义国家和人民的劳动。到目前为止，限制还是必要的。不可能不采取这种限制。有人说许多党的组织是在旧的工作方法中培养起来的，它们还没有学会和掌握同敌人作政治和思想斗争的新的方法，那么，报刊帮助了这些党组织没有呢？报刊对此没有进行过讨论，报刊没有指出右倾观点、资产阶级观点和其他的观点。党内对那些企图恢复旧方式的保守分子的斗争尚未结束，但是我们的报刊却不加分析地批评一切国家机关和公安机关，这不是在孤立保守分子，而是不分青红皂白地否定一切。
    人们不愿意光是重复对过去的批评，必须在批评的同时提出改进意见
    莫拉夫斯基说，必须展开对社会反动势力的整个战线的政治斗争，揭露它们的反对社会主义的企图，报刊应该进行不间断的工作，以便把群众团结在八中全会纲领的周围，动员人民去劳动和努力，人们不愿意光是重复对过去的批评，在批评的同时，报刊还应该指出要怎样作才会更好些。大选就要到来了，在大选运动中我们的报刊要从政治和思想上武装我们的活动家，普及宣传选举纲领，解释党的政策，并且在各种敌人和煽动者面前保卫党的政策。
    莫拉夫斯基说，尽管在我们的生活中已经有了改变，人们对困难的生活条件还是不满意的。许多工人代表向中央提出各种要求，其中有许多是正当的要求。应当使大家了解，要满足这些要求，首先就要生产得又多又省。报刊应当敢于说出自己的观点，对那些正当的但政府目前还作不到的要求进行解释，而对那些不正当的要求加以反对。
