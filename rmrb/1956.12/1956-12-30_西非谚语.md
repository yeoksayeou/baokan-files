West African Proverbs

	One tooth cannot blow a trumpet.
	If you want to sweep the thatched hut, don't sit on the broom.
	A bird that loves to call does not build a nest.
	Repetition is the mother of knowledge.
	You complain about your neighbor's child, what about your own?
	Lies are like driftwood, sooner or later they will be washed ashore.
	A rope always breaks at its weakest point.
