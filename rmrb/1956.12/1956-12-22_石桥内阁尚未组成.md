Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 21st: As of tonight, the new Japanese Prime Minister Tanzan Ishibashi has not yet been able to finalize the list of his new cabinet.

Ishibashi invited Nobusuke Kishi, who had competed with him for the presidency of the Liberal Democratic Party, today to serve as Foreign Minister. After consultations with the leading cadres of his faction, Kishi decided to accept the position of Foreign Minister. However, Kishi also demanded that his group be given at least five cabinet seats in the new cabinet.

The appointment of Nobusuke Kishi as Foreign Minister has been opposed and dissatisfied with by Kenzo Matsumura, a former Progressive Party member, and Mitsujiro Ishii, former chairman of the General Affairs Council of the Liberal Democratic Party. Both of their groups had supported Tanzan Ishibashi's election as party president. The Ishii faction has requested five cabinet seats, while Ishibashi originally intended to give this former Liberal Party group only two cabinet seats.

Regarding the selection of party leaders, Tanzan Ishibashi decided today to appoint Takeo Miki, the former Secretary-General of the Progressive Party, as the Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party. Nobusuke Kishi originally opposed Miki succeeding him in his party position. In order to win Kishi's concession, Ishibashi also agreed to have Shigemasa Sunada, the former Director-General of the "Defense Agency" of the Hatoyama Cabinet nominated by Nobusuke Kishi, serve as the Chairman of the General Affairs Council of the party. The selection of the other four leading cadres of the Liberal Democratic Party will be decided later.

    石桥内阁尚未组成
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：到今天晚上为止，日本新任首相石桥湛山还没有能够确定他的新内阁的名单。
    石桥今天邀请曾经同他竞争自由民主党总裁职位的岸信介担任外务相。岸信介同他的一派领导干部进行协商后，决定答应出任外务相。但是，岸信介同时要求在新内阁中至少要给他的集团的人五个阁员席位。
    对于由岸信介担任外务相这件事，前改进党人松村谦三和自由民主党前总务会长石井光次郎都表示反对和不满。他们两个集团的人都曾经支持石桥湛山当选党总裁。石井派已经要求分配五个阁员席位给它，而石桥本来打算只给这个前自由党人的集团两个阁员席位。
    在党领导干部人选方面，石桥湛山今天决定由前改进党干事长三木武夫担任自由民主党干事长。岸信介原先反对三木接任他在党内的职务。为了换取岸信介的让步，石桥同时同意由岸信介提名的前鸠山内阁“防卫厅”长官砂田重政担任党的总务会长。自由民主党的其他四名领导干部的人选，将在以后再决定。
