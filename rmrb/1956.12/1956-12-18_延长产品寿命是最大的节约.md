Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 17th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Li): Leaders of the Shanghai Tire and Rubber Shoe Industry Company have made the following calculation: If the wearing time of rubber shoes is extended by 20% next year, it will be equivalent to producing more than 12 million pairs of rubber shoes; if the mileage of tires is increased by 5,000 kilometers, it will be equivalent to producing more than 40,000 sets of tires.

Shanghai's industrial departments recently, while examining the work of increasing production and practicing economy over the past few years, affirmed that improving quality and extending the lifespan of products is the best way to economize.

A few days ago, I visited the light bulb lifespan testing lab of the Shanghai Bulb Factory. Rows of bulbs undergoing testing in the lab were dazzlingly bright. A technician who accompanied me on the tour said that the average lifespan of the bulbs they produce has increased from six or seven hundred hours to one thousand to one thousand two hundred hours. The technician also calculated that, because the average lifespan of the bulbs has been extended by three to four hundred hours, the factory has, in effect, increased production by three to four million bulbs based on this year's output.

The "Lighthouse Brand" dry batteries produced by the Shanghai Battery Factory in November can now be used for more than six hundred minutes, whereas in the past they could only be used for more than four hundred minutes. Thus, two batteries now can do the job of three in the past, while the price has not changed. The extended lifespan of dry batteries not only saves expenses for consumers but also economizes on many raw materials used in manufacturing them.

A person in charge of the Shanghai Tire and Rubber Shoe Industry Company recently said at a meeting discussing increasing production and practicing economy that Shanghai's rubber industry plans to extend the wearing time of rubber shoes by another 20% next year, which would be equivalent to producing more than 12 million pairs of rubber shoes for society; increasing the mileage of tires by 5,000 kilometers more than this year would be equivalent to producing more than 40,000 sets of tires. This year, many rubber factories in Shanghai have extended the wearing time of many types of rubber shoes by twenty to thirty days compared to the past, using improved technology without increasing raw materials.

Shanghai Zhengtai, Da Zhonghua, and other rubber factories have also appropriately increased the amount of rubber used, within the limits of raw material supply this year, significantly improving the quality of rubber shoes. Trial wear has shown that the Zhengtai factory's original sneakers used 40% raw rubber in the soles and could be worn for more than one hundred and thirty days, but now, with 45%, they can be worn for about one hundred and seventy days. Technicians from the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory recently returned from the Yumen Oilfield and also believe that using a little more raw rubber in tires used in those areas can greatly extend their lifespan.

In other industrial departments in Shanghai, when recently studying the principles and methods of increasing production and practicing economy, they also realized that they should focus on improving the quality of products. Some enterprises have found that in the past, blindly pursuing output and unilaterally saving raw materials led to a decline in product quality, which caused a great waste of social resources and increased the burden on consumers.

    延长产品寿命是最大的节约
    上海轮胎胶鞋工业公司的负责人算了一笔账：如果明年胶鞋的穿着时间延长20％，就等于多生产一千二百多万双胶鞋；轮胎的行驶里程提高五千公里，就相当于多生产四万套轮胎。
    新华社上海17日电　新华社记者周立报道：上海工业部门最近在检查过去几年的增产节约工作中，肯定提高质量延长产品的使用寿命，是最好的节约办法。
    前几天，记者访问了上海灯泡厂的灯泡寿命检验室。检验室里几排正在作试验的灯泡亮得耀眼。陪同记者参观的一位技术人员说，目前他们生产的灯泡，平均寿命已经从六、七百个小时提高到一千小时到一千二百小时。这位技术人员还算了一笔账：由于灯泡平均寿命延长了三、四百小时，按今年产量计算，无形中增产了三、四百万只灯泡。
    上海电池厂11月份生产的“灯塔牌”干电池已经可以用到六百多分钟，而过去只能用四百多分钟。这样，现在的两节电池可以顶过去的三节用，而价格并没有变动。由于干电池使用寿命延长，不仅使广大消费者节省了开支，同时也等于节约了许多制造干电池的原料。
    上海市轮胎胶鞋工业公司的一位负责人，最近在一个讨论增产节约的会议上说，明年上海橡胶工业规划把胶鞋的穿着时间在现有水平上再延长20％，就等于给社会多生产一千二百多万双胶鞋；轮胎的行驶里程比今年再提高五千公里，就相当于多产四万套轮胎。上海许多橡胶厂今年在没有增加原料的情况下，用改进技术的方法，已经使许多种胶鞋的穿着时间比以前延长二十天到三十天。
    上海正泰、大中华等几个橡胶厂，在今年原料供应允许的情况下还适当地增加了一些橡胶用量，使胶鞋的质量显著提高。经过试穿证明，正泰厂原来球鞋鞋底用40％生胶，能穿一百三十多天，现在提高到45％，可以穿到一百七十天左右。大中华橡胶厂的技术人员最近从玉门油矿回来，也认为在那些地区用的轮胎中稍为多用一点生胶，使用寿命可以延长很多。
    在上海其他的一些工业部门中，最近在研究增产节约的方针、办法的时候，也都认识到应该着重在提高产品的质量的方面打主意。有些企业检查到过去因为盲目追求产量，片面节约原材料，产品质量下降，曾经造成社会资源的很大浪费，并且增加了消费者的负担。
