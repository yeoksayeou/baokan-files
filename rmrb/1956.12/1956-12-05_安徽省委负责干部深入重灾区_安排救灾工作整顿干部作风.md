    Anhui Provincial Party Committee Officials Go Deep into Disaster Areas to Arrange Disaster Relief Work and Rectify Cadre Style

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee, Zeng Xisheng, led responsible personnel from the Rural Work Department, the Department of Finance and Trade, the Industry Department, and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative in late November to conduct investigations and research in Wuwei County, a heavily affected disaster area. They assisted the local party and government organs in arranging production and disaster relief work and rectifying the ideological style of cadres.

    Wuwei County suffered from waterlogging this year, resulting in large-scale crop failure and hardship for the masses. The local Party Committee did not conduct a serious rectification of the agricultural production cooperatives. Many cooperatives had unreasonable work point evaluations and chaotic management. This year, in leading agricultural production, many cadres at the county, district, township, and cooperative levels committed serious errors of coercion and commandism. These situations aroused serious dissatisfaction among the masses, and grassroots cadres were also in a passive position because they were divorced from the masses. The local Party Committee had not taken effective measures to address these serious problems in the past, nor had it conducted serious investigations. When the Provincial Party Committee had already discovered the severity of the disaster in Wuwei from letters from cadres' families and the people, the local leading organs still reported to the higher authorities that there had been a basic bumper harvest and that the disaster was not severe. Before late November, the Provincial Party Committee had sent people to Wuwei County several times to visit the masses and grassroots cadres, and had formed an inspection team jointly with the prefectural committee to investigate the disaster situation. After investigation, it was found that the disaster in Wuwei County was indeed serious, and there were many serious problems in the cadres' work style.

    When the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee arrived in Wuwei County in late November, the county was holding a three-level cadre meeting. The responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee immediately summoned district and township cadres to inquire in detail about the disaster situation and production and disaster relief efforts. Some district and township cadres still could not grasp the local disaster situation at this time, and some were not very daring to report the disaster situation to higher authorities. The county-level leading cadres also could not grasp the overall disaster situation in the county and could not come up with practical and reliable disaster relief methods. The responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee first apologized to the local cadres for the shortcomings of the Provincial Party Committee in not understanding the situation sufficiently in the past and not providing enough assistance to them. Through detailed research on the specific situation, the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee criticized and educated the leading cadres at the county, district, and township levels on their floating and unpractical bureaucratic style of work. The responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee also helped everyone analyze the favorable conditions for overcoming the disaster this year: the masses have all been organized; the country is carrying out large-scale construction, and the avenues for overcoming the famine are greatly increased accordingly. As long as the leading cadres at all levels are determined to change their work style, agricultural production cooperatives can become a huge force for everyone to unite and overcome the disaster, reducing the burden on the state in terms of food and funds. After several days of assistance and education from the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee, the county, district, and township cadres launched criticism and self-criticism from bottom to top at the three-level cadre meeting, exposing the bureaucratic and coercive commandism of the superiors and themselves, and determined to earnestly improve their leadership style starting from the production and disaster relief work this winter.

    Based on the situation jointly studied with the district and township cadres, the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee helped them find many avenues for sideline production and helped the local leading organs and relevant units establish contacts and sign contracts. With the help of the higher authorities, sideline production has expanded a lot. For example, the brick burning project has been expanded by more than one time because the higher authorities helped find sales channels.

### 安徽省委负责干部深入重灾区　安排救灾工作整顿干部作风

    安徽省委负责干部深入重灾区
　　安排救灾工作整顿干部作风
    本报讯　中共安徽省委书记曾希圣，在11月下旬，率领农村工作部、财贸部、工业厅和供销社的负责工作人员，深入重灾区无为县进行调查研究，帮助当地党政机关安排生产救灾工作，整顿干部的思想作风。
    无为县今年遭受了涝灾，大片土地失收，群众生活困难。当地党委对农业生产合作社没有进行认真的整顿，许多社评工记分不合理，经营管理混乱。今年在领导农业生产中，县、区、乡、社的许多干部，又犯了严重的强迫命令错误。这些情况引起了群众的严重不满，基层干部因为脱离群众，工作也处于被动地位。对于这些严重问题，当地党委，在前一个时候，并没有采取有效措施，也没有进行认真的调查。当省委从干部家属和人民来信中，已经发现无为灾情严重的时候，当地领导机关还向上级报告基本丰收，灾情不重。11月下旬以前，省委曾数次派人到无为县访问群众和基层干部，并且和地委联合组成检查组，对灾情进行摸底。经过调查，发现无为县的灾情的确是严重的，干部作风中也存在很多严重问题。
    11月下旬，省委负责同志来到无为县时，县里正开三级干部会议。省委负责同志立即召集区、乡干部详细询问灾情和生产救灾情况。有的区乡干部到这时仍然不能掌握当地灾情，有的则不大敢向上级反映灾情。县级领导干部也不能掌握全县灾情，拿不出切实可靠的救灾办法来。省委负责同志首先向当地干部检讨了省委过去对情况了解不够，对他们帮助不够的缺点。通过对具体情况的详细研究，省委负责同志对县、区、乡各级领导干部的飘浮、不踏实的官僚主义作风进行了批评教育。省委负责同志还帮助大家分析了今年克服灾荒的有利条件：群众都已组织起来；国家正在进行大规模建设，渡荒的生产门路随之大大增加。只要各级领导干部下决心改变作风，就能使农业生产合作社成为大家团结起来战胜灾荒的巨大力量，减轻国家在粮食和资金上的负担。经过省委负责同志几天的帮助教育，县、区、乡干部在三级干部会上，自下而上地展开了批评与自我批评，揭露了上级和本身存在的官僚主义、强迫命令作风，决心从今冬的生产救灾工作开始，就切实改进领导作风。
    省委负责同志根据和区、乡干部共同研究的情况，帮助他们找出了许多副业生产门路，帮助当地领导机关和有关单位建立了联系，签定了合同。有了上级的帮助，副业生产扩大了很多，如烧砖一项，即因上级帮助找到了销路，扩大一倍以上。
