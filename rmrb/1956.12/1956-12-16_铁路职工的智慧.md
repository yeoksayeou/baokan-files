Xinhua News Agency report: The Ministry of Railways and the China Railway Trade Union jointly held a conference in Tianjin from December 1st to 12th to exchange experiences from railway workers in various regions regarding the improvement and creation of tools.

Representatives from fifteen railway administrations across the country brought 769 kinds of advanced tools to the conference. These tools were divided into three sections: lines, bridges, and construction, for exhibition. Furthermore, in the Tianjin area, a railway branch line, an old bridge, and some buildings were selected, and the workers who created and improved the tools, along with representatives from their respective administrations, gave practical demonstrations. Representatives from other regions also tried them out on the spot. Finally, all the tools were studied and evaluated. After a full exchange of experiences, representatives from the engineering departments of each administration made plans to test and promote these advanced tools next year.

Many of the tools exhibited at this conference have a significant impact on improving the efficiency of railway maintenance work, ensuring quality and safety, and reducing the labor intensity of workers. In the past, replacing old rails with new ones required four to six workers using crowbars to slowly pry them up. Now, the Tianjin overhaul team has created a small, manually operated mechanical rail puller that can be operated by just one worker. Workers at the Sandaogou Bridge Engineering Area of the Jilin Railway Administration created six kinds of underwater operation tools, such as underwater excavators and underwater stone retrieval devices. The project of inspecting the foundation of bridge piers, which was originally planned to take four years to complete, will now only take a year and a half due to the new tools. In the past, workers had to wait for the dry season or go underwater to work. Now, regardless of the time, workers can operate without going underwater.

    铁路职工的智慧
    据新华社讯　铁道部和中国铁路工会1日到12日在天津联合召开大会，交流各地铁路职工改进和创造工具的经验。
    全国十五个铁路管理局的代表，给大会带来了各种先进工具七百六十九件。这些工具分成线路、桥梁、建筑三个部分作了展览，并且在天津地区选择一条铁路废线、一座旧桥和一些建筑物，由创造、改进工具的职工本人和本管理局的代表实地表演，其他地区的代表也当场试做，最后对所有工具进行了研究和鉴定。在充分交流了经验之后，各管理局工务部门的代表都作出了明年试验和推广这些先进工具的计划。
    这次会议展出的许多工具，对提高铁路维修工作效率，保证质量、安全和减轻工人的劳动强度有显著作用。过去要把旧钢轨换成新钢轨，必须由四个到六个工人用撬棍慢慢地撬拨；现在天津大修队创造了一种小型的手动机械拨轨器，只要一个工人就能操作了。吉林铁路管理局三道沟桥梁工区职工，创造了水中挖土器和水中捞石器等六种水下作业工具。这个工区检查桥墩台基础的工程，原计划要四年才能完成，现在因为有了新工具，只要一年半就行了；过去工人工作必须等待枯水期或者由工人到水下去工作，现在不管什么时候工人不用下水就能操作了。
