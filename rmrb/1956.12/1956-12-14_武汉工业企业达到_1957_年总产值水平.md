Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    Wuhan’s state-owned, locally state-owned, joint state-private, and cooperative-run industrial enterprises had reached the 1957 total output value level by the end of November. Among the city's thirty-eight larger industrial enterprises, twenty-two had reached this level ahead of schedule.

    This year, Wuhan factories have extensively carried out the advanced producer movement. This is an important factor in Wuhan's industrial enterprises being able to reach the 1957 total output value level ahead of schedule. Currently, employees participating in this movement account for more than 85% of the total number of employees. They have put forward more than 18,000 rationalization proposals in the first eleven months of this year. In the third quarter of this year alone, more than 8,700 advanced producers and advanced workers emerged in factories throughout the city.

    武汉工业企业达到1957年总产值水平
    据新华社讯　武汉市的国营、地方国营、公私合营和合作社营工业企业，到11月底为止提前达到1957年的总产值水平。全市三十八个较大的工业企业中，提前达到这个水平的有二十二个。
    今年，武汉市各工厂广泛开展了先进生产者运动。这是武汉市工业企业能够提前达到1957年总产值水平的重要因素。现在，参加这个运动的职工已经占职工总人数的85％以上。他们在今年十一个月中提出合理化建议一万八千多条。仅在今年第三季度里，全市各工厂中就涌现了先进生产者和先进工作者八千七百多人。
