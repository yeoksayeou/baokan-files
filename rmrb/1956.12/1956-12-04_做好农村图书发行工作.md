    Do a Good Job in Rural Book Distribution
    This April, supply and marketing cooperatives in various districts of Taixing County, Jiangsu Province, successively established special counters for book distribution, which greatly facilitated farmers' book purchases and were welcomed by rural readers. Sales were also quite substantial. For example, the Xuanbu District Supply and Marketing Cooperative had a turnover of 620 yuan in April alone. However, some district supply and marketing cooperatives have not only abolished the special counters for book distribution, but also transferred the full-time book distribution staff to other work. For example, the Chengxi Dasheng Supply and Marketing Cooperative handed over all its books to the Taixing branch of Xinhua Bookstore in August this year, leaving only a few books as samples. Now, the director of this supply and marketing cooperative and the comrade in charge of distribution plan to stop stocking books after these few remaining books are sold.
    We believe that this kind of irresponsible attitude towards rural book distribution is not an isolated phenomenon in the supply and marketing cooperatives of Taixing County. We request the Taixing County Federation to stop this phenomenon and earnestly do a good job in rural book distribution in order to meet the needs of rural readers. Yuan Fei

    做好农村图书发行工作
    今年4月，江苏省泰兴县各区供销社先后建立起图书发行的专柜，对农民买书有很大的便利，受到了农村读者的欢迎，卖书也很不少。如宣堡区供销合作社，只4月份营业额就有六百二十元。但是目前有些区供销合作社，不仅把图书发行的专柜撤消了，连图书发行的专职工作人员也调去做其他工作了。如城西大生供销合作社，在今年8月把所有的图书全部交给新华书店泰兴支店，只留下少数几本书做样子。现在这个供销合作社的主任和负责发行工作的同志，打算把这少数几本书卖后就再不进货了。
    我们认为像这种对待农村图书发行工作不负责任的现象，在泰兴县的供销社说来，并不是个别的。我们要求泰兴县联社制止这种现象，认真做好农村图书发行工作，以满足农村读者的要求。　袁　飞
