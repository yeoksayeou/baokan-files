    Western Standards or Eastern Standards
    An Associated Press reporter, Wayne, sent a dispatch from Cairo expressing his infinite surprise at the stability of the Egyptian economy.
    He said that in the recent months of heroic struggle of the Egyptian people, Egypt's economic situation had not suffered "any deterioration." Egyptian "stores have plenty of food and most necessities. There is no rationing. There is no inflation."
    Indeed, it is even more surprising when comparing the situation in Egypt with the economic situation in Britain and France.
    However, this reporter could not figure out why such a miracle occurred. He said in surprise, "Egypt's economy seems to be riding on a magic carpet. No one knows what is supporting it. No one knows what is driving it. No one knows where it is going. But it can still remain intact."
    However, he did see an important fact. He admitted that "Western standards" are not applicable to Egypt. He said, "According to Western economic standards, this country should be in a very difficult situation." But the fact is not so.
    This reporter did not say what the "Western standards" they believe in are. However, the Eastern oppressed people, who have always been despised by Western enslavers, are very familiar with this standard. The Egyptian people have also seen it very clearly recently.
    The American overlords once asserted that their refusal to lend money to Egypt to build the Aswan Dam would make Egypt submit. Later, they asserted that the "economic blockade" of Egypt would cause the collapse of the Egyptian economy.
    The British and French aggressors even believed that their "gunboat policy" was by no means outdated, and Egypt's resistance would collapse in just a few hours.
    However, now, it is not the "Western standards" that are working, but the anti-colonial Eastern standards.
    The Eastern standard is: you can survive without relying on the US dollar, and you can live better.
    The Eastern standard is: neither "economic blockade" nor "gunboat policy" can conquer the people who dare to stand up and fight for independence and freedom.
    It is not the millions of people who shattered the "Western standards" who are unlucky, but a small group of bloodsuckers and adventurers who stubbornly refuse to accept the Eastern standards.
    In fact, if this reporter is willing to face reality, there is nothing surprising about such an ending, and he can also get the necessary lessons.

### 西方标准还是东方标准

    西方标准还是东方标准
    美联社的记者韦恩从开罗发了一条消息，对埃及经济情况稳定，感到无限的惊奇。
    他说，埃及人民在最近几个月的英勇斗争中，埃及的经济情况居然没有发生“任何恶化”。埃及“商店中有着大量的食品和大多数必需品。没有实行配给。没有通货膨胀现象。”
    的确，如果拿埃及的情况来同英法经济情况对照一下，就更值得惊奇。
    但是，这位记者对为什么会发生这样的奇迹摸不着头脑，他惊异地说：“埃及的经济似乎在一张魔术地毯上行驶。没有人知道是什么在支持它。没有人知道是什么在推动它。没有人知道它要到那里去。但是，它还能保持不垮。”
    不过，他还是看到了一个重要的事实。他承认，“西方的标准”对埃及是不适用的。他说：“根据西方的经济标准，这个国家应该陷于非常艰难的境地”。但是，事实并不如此。
    这位记者没有说出他们所信奉的“西方标准”是什么。但是，一贯被西方奴役者所轻视的东方被压迫人民，对这个标准却是很熟悉的。埃及人民最近也看得很清楚。
    美国的大老爷曾断言，他们拒绝贷款给埃及修筑阿斯旺水坝，就能使埃及屈服。后来他们又断言，对埃及的“经济封锁”，会造成埃及经济的崩溃。
    英法侵略者更认为，他们的“炮舰政策”决没有过时，只消几小时，埃及的抵抗就会瓦解。
    然而，现在，不是“西方的标准”，而是反殖民主义的东方的标准灵验了。
    东方的标准是：不依靠美元，可以活下去，而且活得更好。
    东方的标准是：“经济封锁”也罢，“炮舰政策”也罢，都征服不了敢于站起来争取独立自由的人民。
    倒霉的不是粉碎“西方的标准”的千百万人民，而是死硬地拒绝接受东方的标准的一小撮吸血鬼和冒险家。
    实际上，这位记者如果肯正视现实，这样的结局是没有什么值得惊异的，而且他还可以得到必要的教训。
