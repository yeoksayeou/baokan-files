Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 27th - Prince Sihanouk issued a statement on the 25th, saying: "Some Western countries are using money to buy off some people to oppose the neutral policy of peaceful coexistence with Eastern countries pursued by me and the People's Socialist Community."

In a lengthy statement responding to the Cambodian newspaper "Voice of the Workers," Sihanouk said: "Currently, some foreigners are using money to buy off many people from other parties and the People's Socialist Community, asking them to run newspapers and create various conspiracies to slander and undermine me personally, the royal family, and the People's Socialist Community. These foreigners know very well that if I and the People's Socialist Community have a good reputation and are loved by the people, then Cambodia will be in a strong position, and our neutral policy will become purely neutral, and no one will dare to intervene to make it lean towards one side."

He said that these foreigners "do not want our country to pursue a purely neutral policy; they want to replace our existing system with their own."

Sihanouk also revealed attempts to assassinate him, saying: "I will not hide, because I have not betrayed the country and the people. If anyone wants to kill me, or incite other princes to eat my flesh, I will also calmly wait for others to shoot."

He said: "I deeply regret that those people are willing to sell themselves out and kill each other."

    西哈努克亲王揭露
    西方破坏柬埔寨中立的阴谋
    新华社金边27日电　西哈努克亲王25日发表声明说：“一些西方国家正在用金钱收买一些人，来反对我和人民社会同盟执行与东方国家和平共处的中立政策。”
    西哈努克在一篇答复柬埔寨文报纸“工人之声”的长篇声明中说：“目前，一些外国人用金钱来收买不少其他党派和人民社会同盟的人，叫他们办报纸，制造种种阴谋，来诽谤和破坏我个人、王室和人民社会同盟。这些外国人很清楚地知道，如果我和人民社会同盟有很好的声誉，受到人民的爱戴，那末柬埔寨就将会处于强大的地位，而我们的中立政策就将变成纯粹的中立，没有人敢来干预使它靠拢到哪一方。”
    他说，这些外国人“是不要我们国家执行纯粹中立政策的，他们想把自己的制度来代替我们现有的制度”。
    西哈努克还揭露有人企图对他进行谋害，他说：“我不会躲避的，因为我没有违背国家和人民。如果谁想来杀害我，或者煽动其他亲王来吃我的肉，我也同样镇定地来等待别人的射击。”
    他说：“我很婉惜那些人竟甘于出卖自己而自相残杀。”
