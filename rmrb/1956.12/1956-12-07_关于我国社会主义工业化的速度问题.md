    On the Question of the Speed of Socialist Industrialization in Our Country
　　Wei Yi
　　I
    The speed of socialist industrialization is a question closely related to the destiny of socialism in our country. Correctly determining this speed is a major task of national economic planning.
    Establishing a basically complete industrial system in our country and transforming our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country will take approximately three five-year plans, or a little more time. If we start from the founding of the People's Republic of China, it will take about twenty years. This is the overall speed of socialist industrialization in our country. We can be sure that after twenty years of effort, we will definitely be able to build an industrialized socialist country. Of course, building a highly industrialized socialist country will require a longer period and greater efforts.
      Achieving industrialization in one-fifth of a century is clearly a very high speed. Before liberation, our country's industrial level lagged behind those of developed industrial countries by about a century, or more than half a century. After twenty years of effort, although we may not catch up with the most developed industrial countries, there is no doubt that we will surpass many countries that are currently more industrially developed than us and make our country a member of the ranks of strong industrial powers.
    The speed of industrialization cannot be determined by people's wishes, nor can it be determined solely by needs, but must be determined by various objective conditions. From the main situation in our country, the development of our industrialization has many favorable conditions: because our country has achieved a decisive victory in the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, and will thoroughly complete the historical task of socialist transformation in a relatively short period in the future, this enables social productive forces to develop unhindered; our country has abundant natural resources, and fuels such as ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, coal, and petroleum are not lacking, and hydropower resources can be compared to those of the countries with the richest reserves in the world; our country has extremely vast human resources, which is a well-known fact; due to our large population and vast territory, there is a broad domestic market that can accommodate a huge amount of industrial products. At the same time, our country has the assistance of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, thereby overcoming many difficulties in technology and economy. Because our country's economy is backward and the people's living standards are still low, the broad masses of working people have a high degree of enthusiasm for building socialism, and the establishment and consolidation of the socialist system will further unleash the enthusiasm of the masses. These favorable conditions can enable our country's socialist industrialization to achieve a relatively high development speed. But we must also see that, due to our country's original national economy being extremely backward and lacking a solid foundation, we will inevitably be limited by material, financial, and technical forces in the process of large-scale construction. If we only consider needs and disregard possible conditions, and endlessly expand the scale of industrial construction, blindly pursuing the speed of industrialization, it will inevitably lead to the danger of imbalances and even ruptures in various aspects of the national economy, causing chaos in the entire economic life. Therefore, the Party Central Committee has repeatedly pointed out that we must always pay attention to preventing and correcting the right-leaning conservatism or "left"-leaning adventurism in national construction, especially in heavy industry construction, and base the plan on a basis that is both active and稳妥可靠 (steady and reliable).
    Someone has raised the question: During the period of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, even when it was in a situation of economic and technical isolation, the Soviet people started implementing the first five-year plan from the fourth quarter of 1928 and announced the completion of a socialist society by the end of 1936, spending only a little more than eight years, increasing industrial output by more than four times the pre-war (1913) output, and more than two and a half times that of 1929 (if calculated by large-scale industry, it exceeded 1913 by more than six times, and 1929 by nearly three times), basically completing the historical task of socialist industrialization. Now that our country has very favorable conditions for international assistance, why does it need more time?
    There is no doubt that, in terms of international conditions, our country is much more advantageous now than the Soviet Union was then, and can therefore promote industrialization more quickly. However, it is not appropriate to make a simple historical analogy between our country and the Soviet Union in terms of industrialization time. The Soviet Union also spent twenty years from the beginning of its founding to the completion of socialism, i.e., from 1917 to 1936. In 1927-1928, the year before the Soviet Union implemented its first five-year plan, the output of many major industrial products was much higher than that of our country. For example, steel reached 4.3 million tons, oil reached 11.6 million tons, and cement reached 1.85 million tons. At that time, the Soviet Union's machine-building industry was already able to produce relatively large machines, automobiles, and tractors. As everyone knows, in our country in 1952, steel output only reached 1.35 million tons, oil production only reached 436,000 tons, and cement production only reached 2.86 million tons. The capacity of the machine-building industry was very weak, and many machines, equipment, automobiles, airplanes, and tractors could not be manufactured. Of course, our country's electricity generation and coal production in 1952 had already exceeded the Soviet Union's level in 1928. However, in major aspects, the Soviet Union's industrial base at that time was much stronger than ours, almost five years ahead of our country. Not to mention that the output of industrial products per capita in the Soviet Union at that time was much higher than that of our country.
    When the Soviet Union announced the completion of socialism and basically completed the task of industrialization in 1936, it had already built a basically complete industrial system. In that year, electricity generation reached 32.8 billion kilowatt-hours, coal reached more than 126 million tons, oil reached more than 27 million tons, steel reached 16.4 million tons (including more than 860,000 tons of electric furnace steel), metal-cutting machine tools reached more than 46,000 units, the manufacture of rolling mill equipment reached 26,000 tons, the manufacture of power generation equipment reached approximately 700,000 kilowatts, the manufacture of tractors reached more than 112,000 units (standard units, calculated at 15 horsepower per unit), the manufacture of automobiles reached more than 136,000 vehicles, and the manufacture of locomotives reached approximately 1,700 units. Comparing the production level of major industrial products in 1962 listed in the proposal of our country's Second Five-Year Plan with the Soviet Union's level in 1936, it can be seen that our country's output of electricity, raw coal, power generation equipment, and metal-cutting machine tools will exceed that of the Soviet Union, while the output of crude oil, steel, and tractors will be lower than that of the Soviet Union. On the basis of the level already reached in our country's Second Five-Year Plan, after the construction of the Third Five-Year Plan, by 1967, the output of our country's major industrial products, with the exception of individual items (such as oil), will likely exceed the Soviet Union's level in 1936.
    It can be seen from the above comparison that the speed of industrialization in our country is actually not slower than that of the Soviet Union, or even faster than that of the Soviet Union. Since our country's population is about twice as large as that of the Soviet Union, it is reasonable to have higher requirements for industrialization.
    Precisely because our country has the characteristics of a large population and an absolute majority of the population being agricultural, it is difficult and unnecessary to compare with the Soviet Union in terms of the proportion of industry and the proportion of the means of production industry. In 1937, the year the Soviet Union's Second Five-Year Plan ended, the proportion of large-scale industrial output value in the total output value of large-scale industry and agriculture had reached 77.4%; the proportion of the means of production industry in the entire industrial output value had also reached 57.8% (if calculated by large-scale industry, it reached more than 60%). As for our country's requirements for the proportion of industry and the proportion of the means of production industry, they should be determined according to our country's specific circumstances, and we must never blindly pursue a larger percentage.
　　II
    On the issue of the speed of industrialization, on the one hand, we must adopt a positive attitude, and passive conservatism is wrong. However, on the other hand, blindly pursuing excessively high speed regardless of objective conditions is also wrong.
    The speed of industrialization is mainly and directly determined by the scale of industrial construction, especially the scale of heavy industry construction. Industrial construction requires a large amount of funds, a large amount of machinery and equipment and materials, and a large number of technical talents, which is related to all aspects and departments of the national economy. If the scale of industrial construction and the speed of industrialization are stipulated in isolation without linking them to the entire national economy, the danger of deviating from reality will inevitably occur, and mistakes of conservatism or adventurism will be made.
    The experiences of our country and other countries in the socialist camp clearly show that in the process of realizing industrialization, properly arranging the relationship between heavy industry construction and people's livelihood is of great importance. Among the various relationships that the Party Central Committee has proposed must be resolved, the most important is the relationship between national construction and people's livelihood.
    All construction in our country is ultimately for the benefit of the people. Large-scale construction of heavy industry is to create and expand the material basis necessary for improving people's lives. The basic law of socialist economics clearly shows the ultimate goal of our construction. However, since in the entire national construction, there are parts that directly serve the current needs of the people's lives, and there are also parts that serve the long-term needs of the people's lives and indirectly serve them, the roles of these two parts are different. Therefore, it cannot be said that endlessly expanding the scale of heavy industry construction is correct. Like anything else, the relationship between heavy industry construction and people's lives has a unified side and a contradictory side. This unity and contradiction are also manifested in the relationship between the long-term interests and overall interests of the people and the current interests and individual interests of the people. If we want to correctly combine the long-term interests and current interests, overall interests and individual interests of the people, we must properly arrange the scale and speed of heavy industry construction so that it does not hinder the improvement of the people's current lives and hinder the people's enthusiasm for building socialism.
    We were often captured by a "theory" in the past. According to this "theory," since heavy industry is the material basis for improving people's lives, the larger the scale of heavy industry construction, the better, and the faster the development speed, the better. In the process of establishing a strong heavy industry, it is difficult to take care of and may not even be necessary to take care of the improvement of people's current lives. This theory of absolutizing heavy industry only recognizes that heavy industry construction and people's lives have a unified side, but does not recognize that there is a contradictory side between them. Therefore, it develops heavy industry regardless of everything, and as a result, it will have heavy industry but lose the people, and even have neither heavy industry nor the people. Of course, as far as our country is concerned, although we have not made serious mistakes in resolving the relationship between heavy industry construction and the improvement of people's lives, we must still learn from this lesson and further correct our views.
    Heavy industry is undoubtedly absolutely necessary for national prosperity and people's happiness, and its importance cannot be reduced in the slightest. However, for socialism, what is more important and more necessary is the people, the people's enthusiasm, and the people's love for the socialist system. The "theory" we mentioned above emphasizes only the importance of heavy industry and ignores the importance of the people, placing the people's enthusiasm in an insignificant position. Therefore, it deviates from the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint, violates the basic laws of socialist economics, and harms the cause of socialism. It should be seen that without the people's enthusiasm, heavy industry is difficult to build. Even if it is reluctantly built, it will lack a mass base and cannot be consolidated. On the contrary, as long as we correctly resolve the relationship between heavy industry construction and the improvement of people's lives, we will be able to establish a strong heavy industry more smoothly and make the heavy industry have a broad and consolidated mass base.
    In order to correctly resolve the relationship between heavy industry construction and the improvement of people's lives, we should pay attention to studying the ratio between accumulation and consumption in the national income. Accumulation must account for a certain proportion in the national income in order to guarantee the funds needed for national construction, but this proportion must never exceed a certain limit and must never be subjectively increased. Generally speaking, under normal circumstances, as long as the proportion of accumulation in the national income is not lower than 20% and does not exceed 25%, it can both guarantee the need for funds for national construction and guarantee the improvement of people's lives.
    The idea that the proportion of accumulation in the national income can be continuously increased is incorrect. Although the proportion of accumulation and consumption each account for will change in each year and cannot be fixed, they can only change within a certain limit. This change is mainly determined by the degree of expansion of the scale of national construction. Of course, since the national income is growing every year under the socialist system, even under the condition that the accumulation ratio remains unchanged, the absolute amount of accumulation is also increasing year by year. We must never confuse the annual growth of the accumulation amount with the change in the accumulation ratio.
    To ensure the funds needed for national construction and also ensure the continuous improvement of people's lives, and the proportion of accumulation must be limited within a certain range, the fundamental way is to increase national income. If national income increases rapidly, both the accumulation part and the consumption part will have a faster increase. This is very clear. Not striving to increase national income, but only focusing on the accumulation ratio, will inevitably lead to the path of "draining the pond to get all the fish." Everyone knows that the growth of national income has two factors, one is the increase in labor productivity, and the other is the increase in the number of production workers, and the increase in labor productivity is currently the main factor in our country. Therefore, encouraging the vast number of workers to adopt new technologies, improve labor organization and production organization, improve technical proficiency, and utilize material and human resources in a planned manner, especially saving the consumption of means of production, in order to improve labor productivity, is an important matter.
    There is the issue of distribution of accumulation funds. The part to be used for expanded reproduction, the part to be used for cultural life basic construction, and the part to be used for national reserves should all maintain a certain proportion. From the current situation in our country, we should reduce the non-urgent basic construction of cultural life, such as auditoriums, clubs, etc., that is, non-productive basic construction, and increase productive basic construction. Of course, the necessary basic construction of cultural, educational, and health undertakings, such as schools, research institutes, hospitals, and public utilities, must be guaranteed.
    The consumption fund also has the issue of distribution. The policy pointed out by the Eighth National Congress of the Party to reduce the proportion of national defense and administrative expenses in the overall expenditure of the country is of great importance. The reduction of the proportion of national defense and administrative expenses can use more funds for national construction and the improvement of people's lives.
　　III
　  When our country's First Five-Year Plan had been implemented for half the time, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the issue of accelerating the development of agriculture, and then put forward the issue of paying attention to the development of light industry. This step not only has great practical significance, but also has profound theoretical significance, and is not only meaningful for our country, but also meaningful for all socialist countries.
    Accelerating the development of agriculture and paying attention to the development of light industry, seeking mutual coordination between industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry in development, is precisely to promote the accelerated progress and smooth realization of socialist industrialization, and is precisely to resolve the relationship between heavy industry construction and the improvement of people's lives. Agriculture and light industry, on the one hand, provide consumer goods for people's lives, and on the other hand, provide construction funds for heavy industry, and through foreign trade relations, provide machinery, equipment, and raw materials for heavy industry construction, enabling it to obtain a faster development speed. Therefore, it does not hinder the development of heavy industry. On the contrary, they will help the development of heavy industry in many ways.
    Errors in practical work are always based on erroneous theories. Some people neglect the development of agriculture and light industry precisely because they start from the following "theory": to give priority to the development of heavy industry, agriculture and light industry cannot be developed faster, and only after heavy industry has obtained strong development and can provide a large amount of machinery and equipment can agriculture and light industry be developed faster and solve the problem of improving people's lives. According to this "theory," during the period of realizing socialist industrialization, it is enough for heavy industry to have a high speed of development. As for how backward agriculture and light industry are, it is not important.
    The development of history has refuted the errors of the above theory. The method of only caring about heavy industry and not caring about the development of agriculture and light industry is completely unworkable. This method can only lead to the imbalance of relations between various departments of the national economy and the rupture of normal proportions.
    The relationship between heavy industry and people's lives, the relationship between heavy industry and agriculture and light industry, are external relations for heavy industry; at the same time, heavy industry also has internal relations, and these need to maintain coordination and correct proportions.
    The various departments of heavy industry—fuel, power, metallurgy, machine manufacturing, chemical industry, building materials, etc.—are all closely related to each other. To sum it up, this relationship is the relationship between the raw material industry and the processing industry. The mining industry is the raw material industry for the metallurgical industry, while the metallurgical industry is the raw material industry for the machine manufacturing industry and part of the chemical industry, and vice versa, it is the processing industry. In a sense, the raw material industry is the foundation of the processing industry.
    In the process of realizing industrialization, emphasizing the development of the machine manufacturing industry is necessary, not only because the machine manufacturing industry is the main condition for carrying out expanded reproduction and technological transformation of the national economy, but also because the foundation of our country's machine manufacturing industry is particularly weak under the long-term aggression of imperialism. To carry out large-scale construction and transform agriculture, transportation, and construction with advanced technology and equipment, it is impossible without the strong development of the machine manufacturing industry. However, the strong development of the machine manufacturing industry is only possible if the metallurgical industry has a corresponding development, and the development of the metallurgical industry is inseparable from the fuel industry, the power industry, and other heavy industries. Only when the relationship between various departments of heavy industry is relatively coordinated can industrialization achieve a relatively high speed. Our country must establish a basically complete industrial system, precisely to enable all major industrial departments to achieve a strong and mutually coordinated development.
    To resolve the relationship between the various departments of heavy industry in the development process, so that each department develops proportionally and avoids decoupling from each other, it is necessary to carry out the balance work of major materials. This balance work, of course, cannot only take into account the present, but must have a relatively long-term consideration, and cannot only take into account the domestic situation, but must be linked to the possibility and necessity of international cooperation.
    Since our country's main mineral resources are relatively abundant, and at the same time, we can get the support of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, as long as we strengthen investigation and research work and balance work, and do not make subjective and one-sided mistakes, it is possible to resolve it relatively properly from the internal relations of heavy industry.
    In the process of implementing the First Five-Year Plan, our country, generally speaking, has not made major mistakes either in the external relations of heavy industry or in the internal relations of heavy industry. This is the main reason why our country's socialist industrialization can develop relatively smoothly. Seriously summarizing the experience in this area, we will be able to continue to push our country's industrialization cause further forward, establish a solid foundation for socialist industrialization by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, and complete the great historical task of our country's socialist industrialization by the end of the Third Five-Year Plan or at the beginning of the Fourth Five-Year Plan.

    关于我国社会主义工业化的速度问题
　　未易
　　一
    社会主义工业化的速度，是和我国社会主义命运有密切关系的问题。正确地规定这种速度，是国民经济计划工作的重大任务。
    在我国建立一个基本上完整的工业体系，把我国从落后的农业国改变为先进的工业国，大约需要三个五年计划或者再多一点的时间。如果从中华人民共和国成立的时候算起，即大约需要二十年左右的时间。这是我国社会主义工业化的总速度。可以肯定，经过二十年的努力，我们一定能够建成一个工业化的社会主义国家。当然，要建成一个高度工业化的社会主义国家，还需要更长的时期和更大的努力。
      用一个世纪的五分之一的时间实现工业化，这显然是很高的速度。我国在解放以前，比之那些工业发达的国家，工业的水平大概落后了一个世纪，或者半个世纪以上，我们经过二十年的努力，虽然不可能赶上工业最发达的几个国家，但是毫无疑问，我们将赶过许多现在工业比我国发达的国家，而使我国列入工业强国的队伍。
    工业化的速度不能由人们的愿望来决定，也不能单由需要来决定，而必须由各种客观的条件来决定。从我国的主要情况来看，我国工业化事业的发展有许多有利的条件：由于我国对农业、手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造已经取得了决定性的胜利，并且将要在今后一个比较短的时期内彻底完成社会主义改造的历史任务，这就使社会生产力可以不受阻碍地向前发展；我国有丰富的自然资源，黑色金属、有色金属、煤炭和石油等燃料都并不缺乏，水力资源可以同世界上蕴藏最富的国家相比拟；我国有极其巨大的人力资源，这是人所共知的事实；由于我国人口众多和国土广大，在国内有最广阔的市场，可以容纳庞大数量的工业品。同时，我国有以苏联为首的社会主义各国的援助，从而克服在技术上经济上的许多困难。由于我国经济落后和人民生活水平还低，广大劳动人民有高度的建设社会主义的积极性，社会主义制度的建立和巩固又将进一步发挥人民群众的积极性。这一些有利条件，都能够使我国社会主义工业化事业取得比较高的发展速度。但是我们也必须看到，由于我国原来的国民经济异常落后，缺乏坚实的基础，我们在大规模建设的过程中，就难以不受到物力、财力和技术力量的限制，如果只顾需要而不顾可能的条件，无限制地扩大工业建设的规模，盲目地追求工业化的速度，就必然要使国民经济各方面发生脱节以至破裂的危险，造成整个经济生活的混乱。因此，党中央反复地指出，必须随时注意防止和纠正在国家建设特别是重工业建设中的右倾保守或“左”倾冒进的偏向，把计划放在既积极而又稳妥可靠的基础上。
    有人提出：苏联在建设社会主义的时期，即使当时处于经济上技术上孤立无援的情况下面，但是苏联人民从1928年第四季度开始实行第一个五年计划，到1936年底宣布建成社会主义社会，仅仅花了八年多一点的时间，使工业产量超过战前（1913年）产量的四倍多，超过1929年的二倍半（如以大工业计算，则超过1913年的六倍多，超过1929年的将近三倍），基本上完成了社会主义工业化的历史任务，而我国现在有很有利的国际援助的条件，为什么需要更长的时间？
    毫无疑问，从国际条件来说，我国现在要比苏联当时有利得多，也就能够更快地推进工业化。但是，在工业化的时间方面把我国和苏联作简单的历史类比，是并不适当的。苏联从建国开始到建成社会主义，即从1917年到1936年，同样花了二十年的时间。苏联在实行第一个五年计划的前一年，即1927——1928年度，许多主要工业品的产量要比我国高出很多，例如，钢达到四百三十万吨，石油达到一千一百六十万吨，水泥达到一百八十五万吨，当时苏联的机器制造工业已经能够生产比较大型的机器、汽车和拖拉机；而大家知道，我国在1952年，钢产量只达到一百三十五万吨，石油只生产四十三万六千吨，水泥只生产二百八十六万吨，机器制造工业的能力很薄弱，许多机器设备和汽车、飞机、拖拉机都不能制造。当然，我国的发电和煤炭的生产量，在1952年已经超过了苏联1928年的水平。但是，从主要方面说，苏联当时的工业基础要比我国强大得多，几乎比我国先进了五年的时间。更不用说，以人口平均计算的工业品产量，苏联当时要比我国高出很多。
    苏联在1936年宣布建成社会主义、基本上完成工业化任务的时候，已经建成了一个基本上完整的工业体系，在这一年，发电量达到三百二十八亿度，煤达到一亿二千六百多万吨，石油达到二千七百多万吨，钢达到一千六百四十万吨（其中电炉钢达到八十六万吨以上），金属切削机床达到四万六千多台，轧钢设备的制造达到二万六千吨，发电设备的制造约达到七十万瓩，拖拉机的制造达到十一万二千多台（标准台，每台以十五马力计算），汽车的制造达到十三万六千多辆，机车的制造达到约一千七百台。以我国第二个五年计划的建议所列的1962年主要工业产品的生产水平，同苏联1936年的水平进行比较，就可以看出，我国的发电量、原煤、发电设备、金属切削机床的产量将超过苏联，而原油、钢和拖拉机的产量将低于苏联。我国在第二个五年计划已经达到的水平的基础上，再经过第三个五年计划的建设，到1967年，我国的主要工业品的产量除个别的（例如石油）以外，将都有可能超过苏联1936年的水平。
    由上面的比较可以看出，我国工业化的速度在实际上并不比苏联为慢，或者还要比苏联快一些。由于我国的人口要比苏联多出大约二倍，对工业化的要求更高一些，也是合理的。
    正因为我国具有人口众多并且农业人口占绝对优势的特点，因此在工业比重和生产资料工业比重方面，很难也不必要同苏联进行比较。苏联在1937年，即第二个五年计划结束的这一年，大工业产值在大工业和农业的产值总和中的比重，已经达到77.4％；生产资料工业在整个工业产值中的比重，也达到了57.8％（如以大工业计算则达到了60％以上）。至于我国对工业比重和生产资料工业比重的要求，应当按照我国的具体情况来确定，决不能盲目追求较多的百分数。
　　二
    在工业化速度问题上，一方面，我们必须采取积极的态度，消极保守是错误的。但是，另一方面，不顾客观条件，盲目追求过高的速度也是错误的。
    工业化的速度主要地和直接地决定于工业建设的规模，尤其是重工业建设的规模。工业建设需要大量的资金、大量的机器设备和材料，大量的技术人材，这就关系到国民经济的各个方面和各个部门。如果不联系整个国民经济而孤立地规定工业建设的规模和工业化的速度，就必然要发生脱离实际的危险，犯保守或冒进的错误。
    我国和社会主义阵营的其他各国的经验都清楚地表明，在实现工业化的过程中，妥善地安排重工业建设同人民生活之间的关系，具有极大的重要性。党中央所提出的必须解决的各种关系中，最重要的就是国家建设同人民生活之间的关系。
    我们国家的一切建设，归根到底都是为了人民的利益。大规模建设重工业就是为了创立和扩大人民生活改善所必需的物质基础。社会主义经济的基本规律十分确切地表明了我们建设的最终目的。但是，由于在整个国家建设中，有为人民生活当前需要直接服务的部分，也有为人民生活长远需要服务的部分和间接服务的部分，这两个部分的作用是不相同的，因此，并不能够说无限制地扩大重工业建设的规模就是正确的了。同任何事物一样，重工业建设同人民生活之间的关系，有统一的一面，也有矛盾的一面。这种统一和矛盾，又表现在人民的长远利益和整体利益同人民的当前利益和个人利益的关系上面，如果我们要把人民的长远利益和当前利益、整体利益和个人利益正确地结合起来，就必须妥善地安排重工业的建设规模和发展速度，不使它妨碍到人民当前生活的改善，妨碍人民建设社会主义的积极性。
    我们过去往往被一种“理论”所俘虏。按照这种“理论”，重工业既然是人民生活改善的物质基础，因而重工业的建设规模就越大越好，发展速度就越快越好，在建立强大的重工业的过程中，难以顾到并且也可以不顾人民当前生活的改善。这种把重工业绝对化的理论，只承认重工业建设同人民生活有统一的一面，而不承认它们之间有矛盾的一面，因而不顾一切地发展重工业，结果就将有了重工业而失去了人民，甚至既没有重工业又失去了人民。当然，从我们国家来说，虽然我们在解决重工业建设同人民生活改善之间的关系方面，并没有犯严重的错误，但是，我们仍然必须吸取这个教训，进一步端正我们的观点。
    重工业对于国家富强和人民幸福无疑是绝对必需的，丝毫也不能减轻它的重要性。然而对于社会主义说来，更加重要的和更加必需的是人民，是人民的积极性，是人民对于社会主义制度的热爱。我们上面所说的那种“理论”，就是因为只强调重工业的重要性，而忽视人民的重要性，把人民的积极性放到无足轻重的地位，因而就脱离了马克思列宁主义的观点，就违反了社会主义经济的基本规律，对社会主义事业造成危害。应当看到，没有人民的积极性，重工业是难以建设起来的，即使勉强建设起来，也将缺乏群众的基础而不能得到巩固。相反，只要我们正确地解决重工业建设同人民生活改善之间的关系，我们就将比较顺利地建立起强大的重工业，并且使重工业有广大的巩固的群众基础。
    为了正确地解决重工业建设和人民生活改善之间的关系，应当注意研究国民收入中积累和消费之间的比例。积累在国民收入中必须占一定的比重，以便保证国家建设所需要的资金，但这个比重决不能超过一定的限度，决不能主观地加以提高。一般地说，在正常的情况下，积累在国民收入中的比重，只要不低于20％，同时不超过25％，是可以既保证国家建设对资金的需要，又可以保证人民生活改善的。
    以为积累在国民收入中的比重可以不断提高，这种想法是不正确的。虽然在各个年度中，积累和消费各占的比重会有所变化，不可能固定不变，但是它们只能在一定限度内变化，这种变化主要是由国家建设规模的扩大程度来决定的。当然，由于在社会主义制度下，国民收入是每年增长的，因而即使在积累比重不变的条件下，积累的绝对额也是逐年增加的。我们决不能把积累额的逐年增长，同积累比重的变化这两件事混淆起来。
    既要保证国家建设所需要的资金，又要保证人民生活的不断改善，而且积累的比重又必须限制在一定范围内，由此，根本的办法还在于增加国民收入。国民收入增加得快，不论是积累部分或消费部分，都将会有较快的提高，这是十分明白的事情。不努力增加国民收入，只从积累比重方面打主意，也就必然会走上“竭泽而渔”的道路。大家知道，国民收入的增长有两个因素，一个是劳动生产率的提高，另一个是生产工作者人数的增加，而劳动生产率的提高在我国目前又是主要的因素。因此，鼓励广大劳动者采用新技术，改进劳动组织和生产组织，提高技术熟练程度，有计划地利用物力和人力，特别是节约生产资料的消耗，以提高劳动生产率，是有重要意义的事情。
    积累基金存在着分配的问题。应当使用于扩大再生产的部分、用于文化生活基本建设的部分和用于国家后备的部分都保持一定的比重。从我国目前状况来说，应当减少那些不急需的文化生活的基本建设，如大礼堂、俱乐部等等，即非生产性的基本建设，而增加生产性的基本建设。当然，必要的文化教育卫生事业的基本建设，如学校、研究所、医院、公用事业的建设，是必须保证的。
    消费基金同样存着分配的问题。党的第八次全国代表大会指出的降低国防和行政费用在国家整个支出中的比重的方针，有很大的重要性。国防和行政费用比重的降低，就可以把更多的资金用之于国家建设和人民生活改善方面。
　　三
　  我国第一个五年计划在实行了一半时间的时候，党中央和毛泽东同志就提出了加速发展农业的问题，随后又提出了注意发展轻工业的问题。这一步骤，不仅有巨大的现实意义，而且有深刻的理论意义，不但对我国有意义，而且对所有社会主义国家都有意义。
    加速发展农业和注意发展轻工业，求得工业和农业、重工业和轻工业在发展中互相协调，正是为了促进社会主义工业化的加速进行和顺利实现，正是为了解决重工业建设同人民生活改善之间的关系。农业和轻工业一方面为人民提供生活消费品，另一方面又为重工业提供建设资金，而且通过对外贸易的关系，为重工业建设提供机器设备和原材料，使它得到较快的发展速度，因而并不妨碍重工业的发展，恰恰相反，它们将在多方面帮助重工业的发展。
    实际工作中的错误总是有错误的理论作为依据的。有些人忽视农业和轻工业的发展，正是从下面这个“理论”出发的：要优先发展重工业，就不能更快地发展农业和轻工业，而且，只有在重工业得到强大的发展能够提供大量的机器设备以后，才能使农业和轻工业得到较快的发展，解决人民生活改善的问题。按照这种“理论”，在实现社会主义工业化的时期，只要重工业有高速度的发展就够了，至于农业和轻工业不管怎样落后，也是无关紧要的。
    历史的发展已经批驳了上述理论的错误。那种只管重工业而不管农业和轻工业发展的办法是完全行不通的，这种办法只能导致国民经济各部门关系的失调和正常比例的破裂。
    重工业同人民生活之间的关系，重工业同农业、轻工业之间的关系，对重工业说来是外部关系；同时，重工业还有内部关系，这些都需要保持协调和正确的比例。
    重工业各部门——燃料、动力、冶金、机器制造、化学、建筑材料等部门，彼此的联系都是十分密切的，集中起来说，这种联系就是原料工业同加工工业之间的关系。采矿工业对冶金工业说来是原料工业，而冶金工业对机器制造工业和部分化学工业说来又是原料工业，反过来，则是加工工业。在一定意义上说，原料工业是加工工业的基础。
    我们在实现工业化的过程中，强调机器制造工业的发展是必要的，这不仅是因为机器制造工业是进行扩大再生产和对国民经济技术改造的主要条件，而且因为我国在帝国主义长期的侵略下机器制造工业的基础特别薄弱。要进行大规模的建设，并且用先进技术设备改造农业、运输业和建筑业，没有机器制造工业的强大发展是根本不可能的。但是，机器制造工业的强大发展，只有在冶金工业有相应发展的情况下才有可能，而冶金工业的发展，又离不开燃料工业、动力工业和其他重工业。只有当重工业各部门之间的关系比较协调的时候，工业化才能取得比较高的速度。我国必须建立一个基本上完整的工业体系，正是要使各个主要工业部门都得到强大的互相配合的发展。
    要解决重工业各部门在发展过程中的关系，使各部门按比例地向前发展，避免彼此脱节，必须进行主要物资的平衡工作。这种平衡工作，当然不能只顾目前，而必须有比较长远的考虑，也不能只顾国内的情况，而必须联系国际协作的可能和必要。
    由于我国的主要矿产资源都比较丰富，同时我们又能够得到以苏联为首的社会主义各国的支援，只要我们加强调查研究工作和平衡工作，不犯主观片面的错误，从重工业内部的关系来说，是可以比较妥善地解决的。
    我国在执行第一个五年计划的过程中，从总的说，不论在重工业外部的关系上，或者在重工业内部的关系上，都没有犯大的错误，这是我国社会主义工业化能够比较顺利发展的主要原因。认真地总结这方面的经验，我们就能够继续把我国工业化事业再向前推进一步，在第二个五年计划期末建立起社会主义工业化的巩固基础，并且在第三个五年计划期末或者在第四个五年计划期初完成我国社会主义工业化的伟大历史任务。
