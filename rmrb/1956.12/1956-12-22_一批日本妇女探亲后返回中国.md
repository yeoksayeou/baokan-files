Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Seventy-two Japanese women who are married to Chinese people and their one hundred and five children, who had returned to Japan to visit relatives, arrived back in Qingdao on the 15th aboard a British ship from Nagasaki, Japan, and have since left Qingdao in batches to return to their homes.

These Japanese women returned to Japan in two groups in July and September, according to the provisions of the joint communiqué signed by the Chinese Red Cross Society and the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Liaison Committee. Also on board were Iga Keiiko, a Japanese woman who married a Chinese person and returned to China in 1953, as well as overseas Chinese woman Mei Jinghua and her three children.

Before leaving Qingdao, these Japanese women held separate symposiums to express their feelings about their trip home. They said that the Japanese people they came into contact with during their visit to Japan all expressed a desire to learn more about the new China and to strengthen mutual understanding and friendship between the people of China and Japan. Hayashi Masae, whose home is in Ehime Prefecture, said that many young people in her hometown had asked her to bring their business cards to China, hoping to become friends with Chinese youth. These young people also hoped that China and Japan could restore diplomatic relations as soon as possible so that they could come and see China.

Participants in the symposium expressed their gratitude to the democratic groups and the broad masses of the people in various parts of Japan for their help during their return. They also brought two oil painting gifts from the Japan-China Friendship Association to the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Exchange with Foreign Countries and the All-China Women's Federation, as well as a letter from Tsuneta Youzo, president of the "Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society" in Japan, to Chairman Mao Zedong and Li Dequan, president of the Chinese Red Cross Society. In his letter, Tsuneta Youzo expressed his gratitude to the Chinese government and the Chinese people for assisting Japanese nationals in returning to their country and releasing Japanese war criminals. They also brought gifts such as a "thank you signature book" with over 36,000 signatures and seals.
