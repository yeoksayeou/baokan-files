Xinhua News Agency reports that the Vice-Chairman of the Federal Executive Council of Yugoslavia, Edvard Kardelj, delivered a speech on December 7 at the Federal Assembly of Yugoslavia. His speech is divided into two main parts: the first part discusses the Hungarian issue, and the second part discusses Yugoslavia's future economic policy. The first part of the speech was published in the December 8 issue of the Yugoslav newspaper "Borba." The full text is as follows:

I would like to take the opportunity of discussing the urgent issues in our economic policy to talk about their political aspects. If I happen to touch upon certain issues that are not directly related to our economic policy but which I consider to be politically closely linked to it, I ask the Chairman to forgive me. In the course of discussing the economic plan, one sometimes forgets the political aspects, forgets the development of our political system, and forgets the further socialist development of relations between people. Repeating these errors can have extremely harmful consequences. Our political system, the development of socialist democracy within the country, and the internal stability of our entire society, to a large extent, depend on the nature of our economic policy.

Everyone knows that it is impossible to implement an extremely tense economic policy that requires great efforts from the entire population on the one hand, and to ensure the unhindered development of democracy in the social and political system on the other. For example, it is clear that if the material base of workers' councils and communes is reduced to the minimum, it is impossible to fully utilize their creativity.

We may have paid too little attention to the mutual relationship between these economic factors and political factors in the past. This was inevitable due to various objective difficulties, due to our particularly difficult international environment, and due to the lack of experience in such a young society. However, if we continue to make these mistakes after gaining our own and others' experiences, we will have no reason to excuse these mistakes.

In principle and in practice, we have long abandoned the Stalinist argument that to develop socialism, it is only necessary for the Communist Party to seize power and then, relying on certain state, political, and planning institutions, to "build socialism," that is, to build factories, carry out agricultural collectivization, and set wages for people, all of which is to ensure the leading role of the party. For us, the concept of building socialism, whether in substance or form, is broader and more complex, and only a part of it depends on the subjective wishes of the leading forces. Our view on this matter has often been attacked. However, the recent Hungarian events once again reminded all those who do not want to consider the facts, and those who think that with the victory of the revolution or the seizure of power by a certain Communist Party, objective social laws will stop operating. On the contrary, whoever wants to ignore these laws will suffer.

The true social leadership of the Communist Party cannot be prescribed by law. The party can only become a true leading force by acting according to the objective laws of social development, that is, by becoming the most progressive social factor. Since these laws operate through people and various social classes, the Communist Party or some other organized socialist leading force (in the transitional period from capitalism to socialism) should be organized in such a way that the most advanced socialist tendencies can be expressed through it and the entire social structure; it should also change with the development of socialist relations. If a party does not understand this, no matter how much it beats its chest about communism, no matter how much it flaunts its Marxism-Leninism, and no matter how much it boasts of its historical leadership, it will still hinder the development of socialism. If it insists on going down this path, it can even become a reactionary force. If one thinks that a party can guarantee the progress and democratic nature of its power just by calling itself the Communist Party, that is a serious anti-Marxist misconception. This is clearly evident in Hungary. There, an undemocratic, bureaucratic dictatorship, contrary to the will of the laboring masses, had been pursuing a certain dictatorial policy of a small clique for many years. This finally led to armed action, with the working class, the class that can only embody the socialist transformation of Hungarian society, being the main force. The most important thing here is not who exploited the anger of the working class, nor what slogans the working class followed after spontaneously rising up against the intolerable and reactionary things in society. It is much more important to affirm such a fact: a political system aiming at socialism has essentially become a serious obstacle to the development of socialism, to the extent that it prompted the working class, the main force of socialist development, to engage in armed struggle, because apart from this, it had no way to express its will.

The Hungarian events are a tragedy in the modern socialist movement. This incident is particularly a lesson and a spur for international socialism. This event first of all spurs all progressive socialist aspirations, the views embodying which are: the development of the political system in socialist transitional countries should enable the conscious laboring masses, who have already formed under the conditions of public ownership of the means of production, to constantly express their most advanced material and spiritual development without obstacles and to change the old system. This is the meaning of the demand for democratization, which is currently the main demand in many countries advancing along the path of socialist development.

If the internal social structure of a country is complex, there can be some revolutionary political restrictions temporarily existing. However, the existence of such restrictions cannot allow the socialist social forces to develop freely, because in this case, they will turn into bureaucratic dictatorship. It goes without saying that the use of state power in the economic and social relations of certain socialist countries is not a means of fully liberating socialist forces. One should not forget that as long as the state, as a tool of force, is still an important factor in economic relations and development, there can be no perfect socialist system, let alone communism. Socialism must eventually get rid of bureaucratic obstacles so that it can develop by relying on its own internal dynamics, relying on the stability and internal strength of social and economic relations, and through the higher labor productivity and conscious initiative of the broad masses organized on the basis of public ownership of the means of production, and thus consolidate and defend itself. For this reason, without the parallel development of various special forms of democracy adapted to the socialist economic base, socialism cannot progress.

The scope of our application of this principle is becoming increasingly broader (sometimes with great success, sometimes with lesser success). Stalin criticized our Communist Party for disappearing into the people's front and the masses, which was essentially a criticism of our democratic tendency in the development of socialism. However, Yugoslav socialism, precisely because it developed this democracy and at the same time opposed the false democratic rhetoric that drags society back to outdated political forms, has been consolidated. The crisis of Hungarian socialism, on the other hand, was precisely caused by the lack of any democracy.

The Hungarian events clearly show how important it is to solve these problems for the further development of socialism. In addition, these events show that our main task is not only to solve the urgent and important economic problems at hand but also to ensure the more rapid development of our democratic structures while solving these problems.

Currently, there is a debate in the Communist Party newspapers on whether the cause of the outbreak of the Hungarian revolutionary events is some mistakes made by the past government or the political system. Obviously, although some mistakes were made, if the masses had previously had the opportunity to express their desire to change the policy of the discredited leadership to correct the mistakes, then the occurrence of individual mistakes itself would not have led to such resolute resistance from the masses. Since the socialist labor masses had no way to express these desires and correct the mistakes, it is clear that the problem lies precisely in a certain political system that separates the masses from power.

Such a system, when the policy of the leadership and the basic interests of the laboring masses come into conflict, will inevitably first cause the leadership to detach itself from the masses and then provoke these masses to rise up against such a political system, because this system prevents them from influencing the management of various affairs in social relations.

It is thus very clear that the political system we are talking about is not socialism, nor is it the Leninist Soviet system that allows the masses to influence the policies of the state and the party. What we are referring to here is the sum of such political forms and methods: these political forms and methods isolate the socialist laboring masses and prevent them from directly influencing power, strengthen the bureaucratic elements in the party and the state, and gradually seize some levers of power, resulting in the power becoming something different from the power of the working class. In Hungary, it was precisely this process that caused the Communist Party to detach itself from the masses and led to the dictatorship of a certain bureaucratic clique, which completely forgot to care about the hopes and wishes of the working class and the people of their own country. As Marxists, we must always remember that various bureaucratisms, especially technocratic bureaucratism, according to their own logic, will inevitably push society towards such a bureaucratic political system in the transitional period. Once this process (if the internal socialist forces do not stop it) takes on a large scale, it will not only produce Stalin but also the Hungarian events.

Currently, the international relations of social forces are such that the fate of socialism no longer depends on the situation of defending the achievements of socialism (since socialism is no longer an island in the world), but first of all, it depends on the further expansion of these achievements, it depends on the further development of socialism itself. Socialism does not need to sing empty praises of the various achievements already made in the mutual relations within a socialist country and between socialist countries. On the contrary, socialism needs a healthy, democratic, and critical attitude towards its achievements; it needs an irresistible and profound desire to seek the best solutions, first of all, the solutions to the relations between people. The entire political system of modern socialism should be organized in such a way that this trend and this desire can be expressed everywhere. Only the continuous improvement of the masses can produce this progressive desire. Therefore, democracy is undoubtedly a component of socialism. For this reason, socialism needs discussion, and it needs an open and sincere Marxist analysis of the Hungarian events.

Two Misjudgments of the Hungarian Armed Uprising

Currently, in the socialist movement, two judgments about the Hungarian armed uprising are most commonly heard, but both are incorrect and equally harmful to the further development of world socialism. Some say that it was a premeditated counter-revolution, and some mistakes made by the past political leadership caused part of the masses to turn to the counter-revolution. Others acknowledge that it was a revolution for freedom and national independence; and their concepts of freedom and national independence are abstract and vague, resulting in understanding freedom as the traditional bourgeois democratic multi-party system and understanding independence as a return to the old positions of Hungarian nationalism.

From the first judgment, one can draw the conclusion that the counter-revolution must be suppressed, and as long as some past mistakes are corrected, the problem can be solved, that is, one can go back to the old road. This view is not only a huge mistake but also an illusion. Such a conclusion will numb socialist consciousness, but it is far from saying that the real causes have been understood, and therefore it is far from saying that the problem has been correctly solved. Those who hold this view do not even consider that since the Hungarian working class erupted in anger, the starting point for the further development of Hungarian socialism has been different from 1945. The problem cannot be solved by such methods. This will only exacerbate and complicate the causes of the Hungarian tragedy. If one truly wants to find and explain the real causes of the current crisis, one must try to find and explain the real causes of this crisis. This involves some extremely important issues in socialism, so those who truly cherish socialism cannot ignore the real causes. If the leading forces of a socialist country do not have enough strength to ensure that certain political forms and social relations in a society building socialism are changed through an evolutionary process, then political crises are inevitable. Those who make an objective Marxist analysis of the event can first raise several very practical questions based on the first judgment. First of all, if the problem is only about some "mistakes" made by the Rakosi-Gero group, and not about the bureaucratic system that has already begun to react against the development of socialism, then why did the Hungarian laboring masses have to resort to force and take up arms to oppose the policy that produced these "mistakes"?

Why couldn't the Hungarian working class express its wishes through the corresponding representative bodies, or even through the Hungarian Labor People's Party (which was said to be the most advanced detachment of the working class, but in fact, it had lost all contact with the working class) in a normal way? Finally, is it comforting to the socialist conscience to say that the working class, after achieving its own victory in the eleventh year, followed the counter-revolution? Even if we assume this is completely correct, we should still raise such a question: in this case, should the big stick be used against the working class, or should the big stick be used against the political system that brought the working class to the absurd point of having to rise up against its own historical interests?

However, this erroneous logic cannot but lead to a conclusion that is completely unrelated to socialism, especially to Marxism: any party or state can build socialism without the working class, or even against its will.

The key issue in Hungary today is to fundamentally change the political system

In essence, the spontaneous actions of the Hungarian working class were indeed socialist in nature and acted in a socialist manner. It is true that in the concepts of state institutions, democracy, and party-political relations, it was greatly influenced by various petty-bourgeois abstract words of freedom, but at the same time, it firmly defended the public ownership of the means of production. Not only that, it further developed this achievement by organizing workers' councils, transforming this ownership from the state ownership form into a thorough public ownership form, that is, a form of direct democratic management by the producers' collective. It is also worth noting that the working masses advocated the establishment of a unified workers' council and their unification from the bottom up to create conditions for directly influencing the central state power. This fact itself proves: the Hungarian working class, although confused in thought, actually found the correct path to seizing power.

Of course, it is difficult to say today whether the Hungarian working class will be able to hold onto this position in the struggle for power that continues. Undoubtedly, the revived reactionary forces of the bourgeoisie, which will inevitably receive more and more support from abroad, will try to achieve the final victory. Their policy in this regard is very clear. In the first stage, these reactionary forces try to use the disintegration of the working class in thought and politics to seize state power again. In this stage, these reactionary forces are happy to talk vaguely about freedom and democracy (especially because they are very weak). Once they seize power, they will naturally at least partially abolish the public ownership of the means of production, and in any case, they will limit the role of the workers' councils and gradually abolish them.

The monopoly of the party in the center (whether it is one party or several parties) is incompatible with the true decisive role of the producers' masses realized through the workers' councils in enterprises and communes. Therefore, it is undoubted that the new "multi-party system" in Hungary will soon come into conflict with the workers' councils, just as all attempts to restore the old-style monopoly of a bureaucratized party are currently encountering.

Therefore, if one thinks that the revolutionary conflict in Hungary has taken a certain normal development path after November 4, that is a huge mistake and one-sidedness. On the contrary, the struggle for the thorough socialist and political management forms of Hungary began at that time, and no one who does not make wild guesses can say how this struggle will end. Of course, the greatest possibility is that the socialist forces will hold onto the socialist economic base of Hungarian society. However, in any case, the working class will have to shed a lot of blood and experience many disappointments before it can establish a new democratic structure of the socialist social system through struggle and failure. In addition, one cannot rule out the possibility that the working class and socialism will suffer a serious defeat, thus making Hungary an extremely dangerous object of international conflict.

On the Second Intervention by the Soviet Union

We also view the second intervention by the Soviet Union in this way, regardless of the starting point of this intervention. Here, not only is the right of the people to solve their internal contradictions considered, but also because intervention (during a social crisis) itself can never solve problems. Intervention can only delay the solution of these problems for a period, but it will also sharpen the problems. In this sense, the intervention of the Soviet Union in Hungary itself will not help in solving the internal contradictions of Hungary. However, if this intervention hinders the solution of various problems in the internal political system, and the solution of these problems is necessary for ensuring the healthy development of Hungarian socialism, then this intervention will undoubtedly complicate the situation and bring about serious consequences. However, we also believe that there is a possibility that if this intervention can stop the continued bloodshed and provide the possibility to form such a government and implement such a policy, this government and policy can unite all socialist forces on the basis of a changed political system and ensure that the working class can truly influence the state policy through the workers' councils and other similar institutions of the working class, which it has not done before, then the harm of the Soviet intervention in Hungary, under specific conditions, may be less. Only such positive results can justify the correctness of the Soviet intervention. If there are no such results, then the act of intervention itself will also be condemned by history.

Our attitude today is under attack from two sides. Some, in the name of proletarian internationalism, condemn us for not unconditionally supporting the Soviet intervention; others, in the name of the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and the principle of democracy, criticize us for not unconditionally opposing this intervention.

At the same time, we believe that today, when Hungarian society is in such a deep internal crisis, the Soviet intervention can hardly play a decisive role. This intervention is not the beginning of a mistake but the result of a mistake. Therefore, this intervention cannot save Hungarian socialism from the crisis but only more clearly shows that the political forms of Hungary during the Rakosi-Gero period are untenable.

My personal opinion is that during the Soviet intervention in Hungary, the main factor at play was not the issue of socialism. The main factor was the issue of the balance of power in today's international relations. Any observer with a sense of reality will draw the conclusion: under today's international situation, when the internal development of Hungary has begun to create conditions for intervention by other parties, that is, when the West may establish a political base in Hungary, the Soviet intervention is inevitable. Otherwise, such a situation would greatly disrupt the current balance of power in Europe, seriously disrupt the current balance, and even endanger European peace. Various "Free Europe" type organizations, as well as various fanatical nationalist leaders of Hungary, have confirmed such views. Undoubtedly, this factor has also played a certain role in our attitude, not to mention the attitude of the Soviet government. Therefore, although we are very concerned about the Soviet intervention in Hungary and its consequences for the socialist cause, when talking about socialism, we still believe that the fate of socialism in Eastern Europe today does not depend on declaring support for or opposition to the Soviet intervention. The reason is simple: because this intervention is to a considerable extent caused by the current international situation.

In fact, the main and decisive issue is on the other side, that is: how could such a thing happen in a country where a government that had sworn allegiance to socialism had been in power for eleven years, in a country that was considered relatively developed, with a solid economic foundation and a strong working class? How did the situation develop to the point where it was precisely this class that initiated armed struggle, and how did this indignation develop to the point where another socialist country had to intervene? Whether this process is called a revolution or a counter-revolution, the fact is that the working class, and the majority, rose up against a government that proclaimed itself a socialist power. If this were not the case, then nothing would have come out of the uprising. It is precisely these facts, to a certain extent, that indicate the social nature of the Rakosi-Gero political system.

Therefore, the main issue in Hungary today is precisely the fact that some Communist Parties in certain countries today firmly deny, and precisely the issue that should be discussed today. This is the issue of fundamentally changing the political system, not the issue of replacing some people and appointing others and correcting individual mistakes. Only after achieving this can the negative impact of the Soviet intervention on socialism be greatly reduced.

From these premises, we believe that political support should be given to the Kadar government, expecting or hoping that this government can and is willing to establish contact with the working class, that is, with the workers' councils, and with other truly democratic and socialist factions in Hungary, including members of the former Nagy government. In such a situation, the Kadar government can become a starting point for the concentration of socialist democratic forces that primarily rely on the workers' councils, which can establish an autonomous, strong, democratic, and undoubtedly socialist internal force. This force can establish order and the trust of the people, create conditions for the withdrawal of Soviet troops, and establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union. Only in such a situation can the Kadar government become a progressive and just factor in solving the domestic social contradictions in Hungary. Otherwise, if this government does not adopt such a policy, for example, recent events (first of all, the agreement between the governments of the two countries on the issue of not granting asylum to Nagy and others was broken, and the fact that this group was sent to Romania), there is reason to seriously worry that this trend may prevail in Hungary. If this is the case, this unique opportunity will be missed, and Hungarian socialism will be hit again. Such a development will cause bourgeois nationalism to rise as the main ideological driving force, and the laboring masses themselves will be led further to the right.

Therefore, we believe that this is the main issue raised by the Soviet intervention in Hungary.

The Workers' Councils in Hungary

The most surprising thing in the recent events in Hungary is that the Communists are afraid of the workers' councils. Lenin once boldly put forward the slogan "All power to the Soviets!" although the Bolsheviks were not the majority in the Soviets at the time. However, Lenin, as a Marxist, had sufficient grounds to foresee that when the laboring masses feel responsible for power, their actions will necessarily be in their own interests, that is, to work in a socialist manner. The result was not wrong. In Hungary, however, no one had the courage to put forward such a demand, not even the workers' councils, which were too influenced by petty-bourgeois abstract liberal slogans. However, no matter what the workers' councils became, they are the only real socialist force. If this force can take on the main responsibility of governing in enterprises, autonomous units, and the center, it may quickly get rid of harmful anti-socialist influences. Because the Hungarian Communists, both in the past and now, have not treated the workers' councils in this way, but have only emphasized that work must begin, without mentioning the power of the workers' councils; this is essentially the Communists themselves who have increasingly pushed the workers' councils into the influence of petty-bourgeois and nationalist fake democrats and empty talk.

The facts are as follows. Ignoring or remaining silent about these facts does not help socialism or the unity of socialist forces. Therefore, estimating the Hungarian events as an organized counter-revolution may give some individuals a false sense of comfort in their socialist conscience, but this estimation cannot solve the internal problems of the political system that caused the bloody tragedy in Hungary.

The second estimation of the Hungarian events believes that everything proposed under the banner of freedom and democracy is useful and progressive. On the streets and in various clubs of intellectuals, empty talkers support those who can most quickly turn these slogans into anarchist nonsense, forgetting the actual consequences of empty talk about fake love of freedom, which is nothing more than creating confusion in people's minds and then making them submit to truly existing reactionary factions; these factions, with the help of such empty talk, first try to smuggle in the traditional multi-party system and then seize the leadership themselves.

Title: On the Hungarian Revolution

I am not saying that a large part, and possibly the majority, of Hungarian intellectuals who hold this abstract and futile liberalism, do not genuinely desire true democracy and humanism in their hearts. Nor am I saying that the anti-socialist goal is incompatible with them. However, for anyone to lead a revolutionary movement, sincerity, love for freedom, and humanism alone are not enough. One must clearly understand what one desires. Yet, among the intellectuals who have issued countless futile declarations and slogans, not one has the ability or courage to tell the masses that freedom and democracy, without a certain balance of social forces, a certain social structure, and without definite actual social forces during revolutionary action, are impossible to achieve. At the same time, they have not told the masses that the primary issue of the revolution is to establish such forces, which can only be socialist forces. Only then can one truly speak of a definite democratic political system and the clear content of democracy.

However, in the declarations of Hungarian intellectuals, there has been too little consideration of these issues. While the world of material social forces and basic material and social interests behind them is undergoing transformation and the regrouping of forces, they have only a pile of slogans and illusions. This world, filled with material and social contradictions, interests, and oppositions, ultimately determines everything, including the issues of freedom and democracy. Whoever forgets these facts will soon be left behind. The group of Hungarian democratic intellectuals mentioned here was quickly left behind. These intellectuals saw only the bad consequences of Hungary's past political structure but did not see and were unable to understand its causes or point out a way out to lead socialism and democracy to progress. These intellectuals are not good at creation but only at destruction. When this work was done, the intellectuals adopted the program of the nineteenth-century false democracy and nationalism. This is essentially a surrender, a surrender to Stalinism and the bourgeois system. It is an admission of complete weakness. However, in one respect, these intellectuals remained consistent: until the last moment, they prevented the workers' councils from seizing real power. They established or recognized various pseudo-revolutionary councils in Hungary, but they never openly advocated that power should not be handed over to one or more bankrupt parties, but to a certain institution, the core of which should be the workers' councils, local self-governing bodies, and socialist communes. Thus, amidst the confusion of Hungarian intellectuals, there was still some consistency. This consistency shows that the actions of this part of Hungarian intellectuals were also strongly influenced by bureaucratism, that is, the material and social interests of bureaucratism.

In the first stage, Hungarian intellectuals demanded freedom from Gero, who had long since ceased to regard people as conscious, independent beings. In the second stage, intellectuals hoped to obtain freedom from the revived bourgeois parties, whose "democratic tradition" was well known to people in the past. At the same time, at any stage, intellectuals were unable to point out the true social forces that could embody freedom and democracy, as I have already said, they were unable to point out the workers' councils, communes, and other similar socialist democratic forms.

In terms of ideology, the essence of this movement is empty. This movement is only a superficial and distorted reflection of a profound movement on the basis of a socialist society. Therefore, this movement ultimately boiled down to a mass of contradictory liberal slogans, many of which became empty talk and illusions, while some became masks used to smuggle various anti-socialist programs. Since certain Hungarian intellectual groups were unable to do any creative work to lay new paths on the basis of socialism, they finally had to find old (they had nothing else to do) bourgeois political machinery and Hungarian nationalism from the historical rubble. The tragedy of the Hungarian revolution lies in the fact that these intellectually vacuous elements became the political leaders of the revolution as the situation developed, because there was no other leadership at that time. But the greater tragedy is that at that time, there was no other force and socialist consciousness center in Hungary that could present the Hungarian working class with another choice, to prevent it from retreating to the bourgeois political system or the Stalinist position.

It is necessary to change the political system, not just to replace people and change the names of institutions.

In this situation, the actions of the working class were spontaneous. However, only the actions of the working class were socialist and truly democratic, establishing workers' councils and tending to unite these councils into a nationwide system. This was all that the Hungarian working class could do in the realm of direct practice.

From the somewhat spontaneous actions of the working class, it was evident that the working class organized itself in the form of workers' councils and federations of workers' councils, as if it were a state. This tendency appeared spontaneously, based on the immediate interests of the workers and the needs of Hungarian society based on the public ownership of the means of production. This was actually the only correct socialist way out of the crisis within Hungarian society.

Unfortunately, this process did not develop to its conclusion. The main reason, of course, was the lack of a clear policy and unclear goals. There was a lack of a somewhat mature concept: to isolate the Stalinist and bourgeois reactionary political factors (which concentrated behind petty-bourgeois anarchism and pseudo-liberalism), to transform Hungarian society by transferring power to the workers' councils. In addition, this healthy socialist structure of the working class was subjected to serious political, material, and ideological influences. These influences came on the one hand from those who harbored bourgeois democratic illusions, and on the other hand from Stalinist elements and dogmas. For the former, the workers' councils, as a political form that could ensure the leading role of the working class and socialist forces, played an obstructive role. For the latter, the workers' councils limited the monopoly of the ruling party.

Therefore, it can be said without exaggeration that the main feature of the spontaneous indignation of the Hungarian working people was that the subjective socialist factors of the revolutionary reality had no effect, and these factors could have, according to the program of socialist and socialist democracy, driven the working class to struggle for power through the workers' councils and other self-governing bodies of the working people.

Thus, the question arises: how did Hungarian socialism suffer such a severe ideological defeat?

The Hungarian revolutionary struggle was essentially the first clear example of using violence to settle obstacles on the path of further development of socialism, obstacles that were the product of a deeply rooted bureaucratic political system, and in certain cases, a natural social phenomenon of the transition from capitalism to socialism. However, these socialist democratic forms and ideas were just beginning to sprout, and experience was lacking. Social development itself inevitably required rapid progress in political institutions and ideological life. In addition, the material and ideological conservatism of a certain system, using the rich revolutionary tradition of the past, resisted this progress. Therefore, in the situation of the social movement that occurred in Hungary, unconscious spontaneous indignation could prevail. This indignation was basically healthy, but as long as there was a lack of a clear ideological center or a complete lack of subjective leadership factors, this indignation could lead to serious negative consequences and cause ideological and political confusion in further development. In revolutionary events, when spontaneous forces prevail, illusions also dominate people's minds, while actual actions retreat to certain old forms that are idealized in the present. In other words, those who could not find the way forward in the forest at a time of chaos first began to turn back, and then even to run back, despite the fact that this would lead their initiated cause to a tragic end.

What happened in Hungary was exactly this. The former Rákosi-Gero regime and the dominant Stalinist dogmas not only accumulated a large number of social contradictions but also left the minds of socialist fighters empty. In this bureaucratic system, the broad masses of sincere revolutionaries and socialist fighters were educated in such a way that after the victory of the revolution, the subjective factor was only to establish enterprises, invest endlessly, ensure state procurement, propagate government measures, and extract as much money as possible from the national economy to invest and achieve the highest possible plan indicators. Immersed in this bureaucratic system, any politician and party activist had to memorize various figures about the national economy, which were often of little significance. However, no one could, and even felt no need to, see or understand what was happening among the people? What social processes were taking place? What new social forces were emerging? What social forces were declining? What contradictions were arising? What forms did they take? Where were the tendencies of degeneration? Where did the progress of socialism determine the elimination of old things and so on, in order to subsequently make economic policy also conform to these indicators.

However, under this system, people knew more about the breeds of chickens and potatoes than about people. Yet, under these conditions, politics disappeared, leaving only discussions of plan figures, discussions of steel and machine production, discussions of potatoes and corn, discussions of—as I have already said—methods of raising livestock, etc. Of course, I do not deny the necessity of such discussions (especially among experts). However, if only such discussions are limited, then this is a sign that not everything is good. The responsibility for guiding people on how to raise livestock cannot be included in the tasks of a central social body and political body of a socialist country. Of course, they should ensure that there are specialized organizations ready to provide necessary technical and material assistance to anyone who asks. However, the main task of these central bodies is undoubtedly to provide material and spiritual support to every person at every post through political and economic organizational structures in society, so that they can produce more and better, while giving them full independence to fully develop their creativity and initiative. When we talk about the construction of socialism, if we strive to ensure that the socialist system in its development relies on the free actions of the socialist working people rather than on the power of the state, then this should be the main goal of our social structure construction.

We have always emphasized that the construction of socialism (if we use this somewhat inaccurate, propagandistic term—socialist construction—to represent the conscious actions of those striving to develop socialist relations), in this sense, socialist construction is not a process like the construction of a house. This is not a process that can be commanded and led in a bureaucratic office. Socialist construction is an organic social process in which the leading force should only strive for the liberation of socialist forces and the protection of these forces from interference by various factors.

In this process, there are various social forces, from the remnants of the past to the transitional new phenomena, such as bureaucratism, which can become a very serious social force. The working class itself is changing in the process of socialist development. The internal relations in which the working class exists are changing, and the consciousness of the working class is also changing. It is absurd in thought and reactionary in politics to understand the process of socialist development only from the starting point of the socialist revolution, that is, only from the conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Due to this view, the continuous, automatic praise of everything that exists in a country ruled by the Communist Party was born. As if all social problems in that country were permanently solved, that is, all these problems could be peacefully solved according to decrees, and every problem could be waited for without any concern until such a time when a certain office of the centralized administrative body would consider that the time to solve this or that problem had come. Unfortunately, this idealist formula is not only a satire but also a reality. According to this idealist formula, it is determined that in the transitional period, good results of social development will not be produced every day, every hour, nor will bad results of social development be produced every day, every hour.

Socialism needs a healthy, democratic, and critical attitude towards its achievements.

If the discussion of social development problems in the transitional period is reduced to the remnants of the overthrown bourgeoisie, this is a serious mistake. In a relatively developed country, after ten years of socialist development, these remnants should be factors with little political significance. The structure of the transitional period state also produces other factors, which are much more important, and the historical reactionary forces resisting socialist progress are embodied in these factors in new forms. As we all know, this is first and foremost bureaucratism, which appears in the form of Stalinism and bourgeois democracy. Only when the conflict between bureaucratic despotism and the need for further development of socialism is extremely serious, to the point of arousing the anger of the working class and forcing it to attack this bureaucratism, can the bourgeois counter-revolutionary forces become a serious political factor. Do not forget that the victory of the French counter-revolution was not achieved by its own internal forces, but only after the terror of the Jacobins completely contradicted the actual needs and possibilities of French social development. The counter-revolution, although it appeared to be victorious on the surface, could not eliminate that which was important for the continued development of capitalism. However, after this, a series of conflicts and revolutions had to occur in succession, gradually cleansing the political system of those factors that hindered the rapid development of society.

The characteristic of Hungary during the Rákosi period was the lack of any serious analysis of the process of social development in the transitional period, and even the prohibition of discussing social relations and other issues that did not conform to the following myth under the threat of the death penalty: in a society that is building socialism, there are no reactionary and conservative factors except the remnants of the bourgeoisie. According to this doctrine, the development of Hungary was consistent with the policy of the government, and therefore the government should enjoy absolute power. According to this concept, the propaganda and explanation of the government's measures is the only task of those who are willing to promote the socialist cause. This is also the task of social science. According to this, all ideological work lost any creative stimulus and sank to the pitiful position of a slave of unprincipled pragmatism.

The question arose: what kind of socialist cadres could such a system produce? Did it provide the possibility for the spontaneous forces of socialism to correct the so-called leading forces' policy? In short, how could the socialist consciousness of the working people, which should ultimately become the basis for the stability of the entire social system, be formed? Of course, under the above conditions, the answer to all these questions could only be negative. In fact, the political system itself and the party, which should be the most progressive force in the country according to its position, did not cultivate cadres who could become the representatives and spokesmen of the progressive tendencies of Hungarian socialism. In this way, the rift between the masses and the leadership of the Hungarian Labor Party became irreparable, and the Hungarian working class was disarmed ideologically and influenced by various thoughts from all sides.

Only such an abnormal situation can explain why the Petőfi Club, which included various intellectuals (from particularly progressive, socialist intellectuals to petty-bourgeois anarchists and openly anti-socialist reactionaries), could initially become the only outlet for the oppressed people's energy and later become one of the main ideological and political guides.

This abnormal political form and the activities of this club as the main ideological force of socialist anger showed how desolate the ideological landscape left by the Rákosi-Gero bureaucratic system was.

The Hungarian workers' councils also developed in this ideological atmosphere. We have seen that they were opposed by the Rákosi-Stalinists and petty-bourgeois liberalism. Those Communist Party members who criticized the Rákosi-Gero regime and broke away from it did not understand them. Some Communist Party members were still under the influence of old Stalinist dogmas and had become accustomed to not trusting the masses, not trusting the socialist consciousness of the working class, not trusting the material necessity for the working class to act in a socialist manner, and did not understand how the working masses could directly, and not just through the party or the party leadership, participate in the power system and decide issues. The Hungarian Labor Party, which had ruled the country for ten years relying solely on bureaucratic political and economic institutions, disintegrated, and for this reason, it was no longer a real socialist factor. Although it changed its name, it tried to make the Hungarian working people believe that the problem was thus solved. However, the Hungarian workers rose up against the bureaucratic system, not against the name of the party that established this system. The progressive socialist forces in Hungary did not need to waste effort on restoring the Communist Party and other parties. In essence, in the past revolutionary days, they should have fought for the victory of the principle of direct democracy, by establishing unified workers' councils and self-governing communes as the main basis for the new socialist power. Only in such democratic institutions could the socialist forces rise again, and such a rise could become a direct element of these institutions. However, the heavy burden of past, rigid dogmas weighed too heavily on the Hungarian communists, and they could not make such a thorough change; no matter how absurd it seemed, the communists preferred to turn to the traditional bourgeois multi-party system—even if this would hand Hungary over to reactionary forces—rather than give up the fantasy of their mass party, which in fact had been abandoned by the masses, because for the masses, such a party was the embodiment of bureaucratic despotism. In those days, Hungary desperately needed progressive fighters for socialism, but not Stalinist socialists, nor socialists organized within the old parties (no matter what name they appeared under). These fighters should have appeared where there was a working class, within the working class, and for this purpose, new organizational forms and new methods of work had to be found.

Because this opinion seemed alien to the Hungarian Communist Party leaders, and because they could not get rid of the old formulas no matter what, after the most stubborn Stalinists were initially isolated, a split occurred among them. Some, influenced by the false love of freedom slogans and beautiful illusions about the bourgeois democratic system, began to establish a power parallel to the workers' councils, which was ultimately against the workers' councils, because these two forms were incompatible.

We need not talk about the fact that in the situation of such sharp social conflicts in Hungary, hoping for some traditional, peaceful multi-party democracy was pure fantasy. Even if the facts were not so, one would still ask: why did the communists remain intoxicated by the so-called mass party they had actually lost, and reject the true forces of the working class and socialism? These forces were embodied in the workers' councils and could become the backbone of the new political structure—Hungarian socialist democracy, direct democracy. If they had treated the Hungarian workers in this way, they would have understood. But a party that had suffered a terrible collapse precisely because it did not allow true Marxist thought to be expressed now developed them, and they could not understand. On what basis could the workers believe that the old evils would not be repeated? Just by changing people? No. The political system must be changed, not just people and the names of organizations.

Another part of the good communists, seeing the situation develop to the point where the forces of bourgeois restoration were truly becoming more and more arrogant, were frightened. The same fear paralyzed most of the working class and made them passive, these workers who could no longer see their future in the Nagy government and were afraid to return to the old, Stalinist path. Therefore, some communists split from the Nagy government, some became passive onlookers, and some sought refuge in the Soviet army. For this part of the communists, the revolutionary workers' councils were an alien institution, which allegedly threatened the position of the Communist Party in the power structure, and therefore it could not be the starting point for building a new socialist political system. Later, the intervention of the Soviet Union and the establishment of the János Kádár government were the inevitable result of this situation.

The most important problems of socialism must be openly discussed.

I have already said above that considering the entire situation in Hungary, it was clear in advance: when Hungary became the scene of intervention from the other side, Soviet intervention was inevitable. And Hungary began to become such a scene from the moment when the old political structure of Rákosi was not replaced by a truly progressive, democratic, and socialist structure, but began to be replaced by an old, unacceptable political structure of a bourgeois state (that is, a state with private ownership of the means of production) under Hungarian conditions. Such a Hungary could not be an independent Hungary. Such a Hungary would disrupt the existing balance of power in Europe, thereby exacerbating the confrontation between hostile international forces.

Because there has never been a serious communist faction that could clearly present a program for the role, tasks, and purposes of the workers' councils—the backbone of the political structure of the Hungarian socialist revolution—even attempting to do so, the workers' councils were increasingly influenced by various pseudo-democratic slogans, which aimed to isolate the workers' councils from power and limit the role of the workers' councils to being a certain political trade union representative within a state machine established independently of the workers' councils. Even those Hungarian intellectuals who initially treated the workers' councils with particularly sincere and progressive attitudes could not play a decisive positive role. On the contrary, they often, because they could not see the direction, led the working class astray. Because these intellectuals, apart from wanting to restore the old capitalist structure, were unable to propose anything new to replace the Rákosi system, these intellectuals abandoned the workers' councils, depriving them of any future, often turning them into bases for actual resistance and drafting political programs that claimed to be democratic, and increasingly yielding to counter-revolutionary forces.

Therefore, the causes of the Hungarian tragedy and the failure of the desire for socialist democracy in this uprising should be sought in these factors. However, my intention is not to say that the progressive tendencies that caused the uprising also suffered a failure. Perhaps, based on their experience and in their struggle against reactionary forces, they will gradually gain a clearer understanding of the sum of socialist desires and democratic desires in the workers' councils. However, the development of events was faster than the process of forming new consciousness, and thus the entire system of workers' councils fell into a state of immaturity and paralysis.

In addition, it should be noted that the progressive socialist forces lacked the experience to overcome bureaucratism and could not yet summarize a democratic political form from it. Before the Twentieth Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, in fact, only Yugoslavia had seriously sought and found a way to politically resolve the contradictions of the transitional period, establishing self-governing bodies in all aspects of social life, thereby freeing society from the political forms and methods that bureaucrats tried to use to keep the entire society in a state of stagnation. Of course, we do not say that everything we do is the only feasible and best for everyone. Recently, we have been criticized from all sides for this. What we said, and what Comrade Tito recently said in his speech (this speech has been attacked by many), is only a fact: Yugoslav socialism was the first to begin to thoroughly liquidate bureaucratism as a social force through gradual changes in the entire political system; any socialist country cannot avoid this task if it hopes to clear the way for the unhindered development of socialist and democratic relations among people. Naturally, each country will determine its own path. From this, it is clear that only life and future development through various successes and failures can provide the most progressive social forces of socialist countries with the necessary experience and necessary theoretical conclusions to ensure the further development of socialism under the increasingly strong influence of progressive socialist consciousness. This is a prerequisite that can ensure the avoidance of Hungarian-style bloody events and crises in the future, ensuring that the development of socialism and democracy is truly realized under the conditions of continuous, gradual progress, rather than under the conditions of serious social upheaval.

If all this is true, then it is clear that we have no right to ignore the most important problems of modern socialism, whether it is us or others who cherish socialism. Without being a Marxist, one can also know: the Hungarian event was not accidental, not the result of hundreds of millions of dollars spent on anti-communist propaganda. Only the conservatives in the communist movement repeat the above argument and comfort themselves with it; they are like ostriches who want to hide their heads in the sand and wait for the unpleasant days to pass. Of course, they are wrong. Unpleasant days will not pass so easily because they have deep roots. If individual communist parties continue to deceive themselves and deceive the part of the masses that follows them, then these days will undoubtedly be repeated.

In any case, our historical responsibility is: as Marxists, we should face the facts without hesitation, without prejudice, and regardless of everything. First of all, we must deeply analyze the causes of the Hungarian uprising and similar phenomena in Eastern Europe, and draw conclusions to help the socialist forces more quickly and thoroughly get rid of the heritage of Stalinist despotism. Similarly, we must draw some general conclusions about the structure of social movements in the transitional period based on past experience, because it is precisely here that Stalin's certain theory and the forced application of this theory in various socialist countries have caused the greatest harm.

Constructive, comradely, and socialist discussions will only help prevent the spontaneous processes that occurred in Hungary from repeating. This is especially necessary because the Hungarian tragedy convincingly proves that this event is not only a blow to socialism but also a danger to European and world peace. For the continued development of socialism and socialist democracy, peace is above all.

I do not want to talk about the prospects for Hungary's future development. It is clear that whether the measures recently taken by Hungary are correct from a historical perspective depends on whether Hungary's political and social relations develop in the direction I mentioned above. If the trend to restore the past political system (even if it is less brutal) wins, then the problem will not be solved. History and the Hungarian working people will sooner or later blame the decisive elements in power and opposition in Hungary today for their political behavior, because, in this transitional period, they did not find a path to consensus on the basis of socialism, socialist democracy, and independence.

    卡德尔同志谈匈牙利问题
    ——十二月七日在南斯拉夫联邦国民议会上的演说的第一部分
    新华社讯　南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会副主席爱·卡德尔12月7日在南斯拉夫联邦国民议会上发表了演说。他的演说共分两大部分，第一部分是谈匈牙利问题，第二部分是谈南斯拉夫未来的经济政策。南斯拉夫“战斗报”12月8日刊载了演说的第一部分，全文如下：
    我想乘讨论我国经济政策中的迫切问题的机会，谈一谈这些问题的政治方面。如果我顺便谈到了某些同我们的经济政策没有直接关系，然而我看来在政治上是同它紧密相联的问题，那就请主席同志原谅。在讨论经济计划的过程中，有人有的时候会忘记政治方面，忘记我们政治制度的发展，忘记人与人之间的关系的进一步的社会主义发展。重犯这些错误可能产生极其有害的后果。我们的政治制度、国内社会主义民主的发展取决于我国经济政策的性质。我们整个社会的内部稳固以及它的顺利的社会主义的发展，在很大程度上也取决于这一方面的进步。
    每个人都知道，一方面实行极端紧张的、要求全体人民作出巨大努力的经济政策，另一方面又要保证在社会制度和政治制度中无阻碍地发展民主，这是不可能的。譬如，大家清楚，假如把工人委员会和公社的物质基础缩小到最低限度，那就谈不到充分发挥它们的创造性。
    我们过去对这种经济因素和政治因素的相互关系可能是关心得太少了。这是迫不得已的事，是由于种种客观困难，由于我们所处的特别困难的国际环境，由于我们这样一个年青的社会缺少经验。但是假如有了自己的和别人的经验，我们还继续犯这些错误、那么我们就没有任何理由原谅这些错误了。
    在原则上以及在实践上我们早就放弃了斯大林主义的论点，按照这种论点，要发展社会主义只要共产党掌握了政权，然后依靠一定的国家、政治和计划机构来“建设社会主义”，也就是建设工厂，实行农业集体化，给人们规定工资，而这一切都为了保证党的领导作用。但是对于我们来说，建设社会主义的概念无论在实质上或者形式上，范围还更广泛，内容还更复杂，它只有一部分是取决于领导力量的主观愿望的。过去我们这种观点常常受到攻击。然而，最近的匈牙利事件再一次提醒了所有不愿意考虑事实的人，以及认为随着革命的胜利或者某一个共产党获得了政权，客观的社会规律就会停止起作用的人。正相反，谁要想轻视这些规律，谁就会吃苦头。
    共产党的真正社会领导作用不能由法律规定。党只有根据客观的社会发展规律行动，才能成为真正的领导力量，也就是成为最进步的社会因素。由于这些法则是通过人、通过各种社会阶级起作用的，共产党或某种其他有组织的社会主义的领导力量（在从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期）应当组织得使最先进的社会主义倾向能通过它以及整个社会结构表现出来；它自己也应当随着社会主义关系的发展而改变。假使一个政党不懂得这点，无论它怎样大拍自己的共产主义胸膛，无论它怎样炫耀自己的马克思列宁主义，怎样标榜它的历史领导作用，它仍然会对社会主义的发展起阻碍作用。如果它继续硬要走这条道路，甚至可以变为反动力量。如果认为，一个党只要称为共产党就可以保证自己的政权的进步和民主性质，那就是严重的反马克思主义的错误看法。这点在匈牙利表现得很明显。在那里，一个官僚专制的反民主制度，违反劳动人民大众的意志，多年来奉行了一个小集团的某一种专制政策。这在最后引起了武装行动，行动的主力是工人阶级，也就是只能体现匈牙利社会的社会主义改造的阶级。这里最重要的并不在于谁利用了工人阶级这种愤怒，不在于工人阶级在自发地起来反对社会上不可容忍和反动的东西以后跟着什么样的口号走。重要得多的是要肯定这样一个事实：某种以社会主义为目标的政治制度，实质上已经变成了严重妨碍社会主义发展的障碍，以致促使作为社会主义发展的主力的工人阶级起来进行武装斗争，因为除此以外它没有任何途径能表达自己的意志。
    匈牙利事件是现代社会主义运动中的一个悲剧。这件事尤其是对国际社会主义的教训和鞭策。这次事件首先使所有进步的社会主义愿望受到鞭策，体现这种愿望的观点是：过渡时期社会主义国家里的政治制度的发展，应当使已经在生产资料公有制的条件下形成的觉悟的劳动人民群众，能够经常地表现出他们的最进步的物质和精神发展，没有阻碍地改变旧制度。这就是要求民主化的含义，目前这种要求正是在许多沿着社会主义发展道路前进的国家里的主要要求。
    如果某个国家内部社会结构复杂，那就可以有一些革命的政治限制暂时存在。但是，这种限制的存在不能使社会主义的社会力量自由发展，因为在这种情况下它们会变成官僚主义的专制统治。不言而喻，在一定的社会主义国家的经济和社会关系中运用国家威力并不是充分解放社会主义力量的手段。不应当忘记，只要作为强力工具的国家还是经济关系和发展的重要因素，就谈不到完美的社会主义制度，更谈不到共产主义。社会主义终归应该摆脱官僚主义的障碍，以便使它能够依靠自己内部的动力发展，能够依靠社会经济关系本身的稳定和内部力量以及通过在生产资料公有制的基础上组织起来的广大群众的更高的劳动生产力和自觉的主动性得到巩固，并且以此自卫。正因为这样，如果没有适应社会主义经济基础的各种特殊形式的民主的平行发展，社会主义便不可能进步。
    我国运用这一原则的范围越来越广泛（有时成绩大，有时成绩小）。斯大林批评我们的共产党消失在人民阵线和群众之中，实质上正是批评我们在社会主义发展中的这种民主倾向。但是南斯拉夫的社会主义，恰恰是由于发展了这种民主并且同时反对了把社会倒拖到过时的政治形式去的假民主的空话而巩固起来的。而匈牙利社会主义的危机则恰恰是由于缺乏一切民主而引起的。
    匈牙利事件清楚地表明，解决这些问题对社会主义的进一步发展具有多么大的意义。此外，这些事件还表明，目前我们主要的任务不仅仅是解决当前迫切和重要的经济问题，而且在我们解决这些问题时，应当保证更迅速地发展我们的民主结构。
    目前在共产党的报纸中进行这样的辩论：匈牙利革命事件爆发的原因是过去政府所犯的一些错误还是政治制度。显然，虽然产生了一些错误，但是如果群众过去有可能表达出自己要求改变威信扫地的领导机构的政策以便纠正错误的愿望，那末产生个别错误这件事本身不致会引起群众这样坚决的反抗。社会主义劳动群众既然没有可能表达这些愿望和纠正错误，那就很明显，问题正是在于把群众同政权隔离开来的某种政治制度。
    这种制度在领导机构的政策和劳动群众的基本利益一旦发生冲突的时候，迟早总会首先使这个领导脱离群众，然后引起这些群众起来反对这种政治制度，因为这种制度使他们没有可能去影响对社会关系中各种事务的管理。
    可见非常明显，我们所说的政治制度并不是指社会主义，也不是指让群众有可能去影响国家和党的政策的列宁主义苏维埃制度。我们这里指的政治制度是下述这样一些政治形式和方法的总和：这些政治形式和方法隔绝了社会主义劳动群众，不让他们有可能直接影响政权，加强了党和国家中的官僚主义因素，并且使它们逐渐掌握政权的一些杠杆，结果，政权就会变质而成为不同于工人阶级政权的东西了。在匈牙利，正是这种过程使共产党脱离群众，促成某种官僚主义集团的专制，这个集团根本忘记了要去关心本国的工人阶级和本国人民的希望和愿望。作为马克思主义者，我们时刻不能忘记，各种官僚主义，特别是经济技术至上主义，根据其本身的逻辑来看，在过渡时期势必会把社会推向这种官僚主义的政治制度。一当这种过程（如果内部的社会主义力量没有挡住它的话）采取巨大规模的时候，就不仅会产生斯大林，而且还会产生匈牙利事件。
    目前，社会力量的国际关系是这样的：社会主义今后的命运已经不再由保卫社会主义成果的情况来决定（因为社会主义不再是世界上的孤岛了），而首先是取决于这种成果的进一步扩大，取决于社会主义本身的进一步发展。社会主义不需要对在某一个社会主义国家内和在社会主义国家间的相互关系中所已经取得的各种成就作空泛的歌颂。相反，社会主义需要对自己的成就采取健康的、民主的和批判的态度，它需要一种不可抑制和深邃的愿望去谋求最好的解决，首先是人与人之间关系的解决。现代社会主义的整个政治制度应当组织得使这种趋势和这种愿望到处都能够表现出来。只有群众不断提高才能产生这种进步的愿望。因此，民主毫无疑问应当是社会主义的一个组成因素。正因为这个缘故，社会主义需要讨论，需要对匈牙利事件进行开诚布公的马克思主义的分析。
    对匈牙利武装起义的两个错误估计
    现在在社会主义运动中最常听到对匈牙利武装起义有两种估价，然而这两种估价都是错误的，对世界社会主义的进一步发展是同样有害的。有的人说，这是一种事先策划的反革命，而过去的政治领导所犯的某些错误使一部分群众倒向了反革命那一边。另外一些人确认，这是争取自由和民族独立的革命；而他们对自由和民族独立的概念都是抽象的，模糊的，结果是把自由理解为传统的资产阶级民主的多党制度，把独立理解为回到匈牙利民族主义的旧立场。
    从头一种估价可以得出的结论是，反革命必须镇压，只要纠正过去某些错误，问题就可以解决，也就是说可以再走过去走过的道路。这种意见不仅是巨大的错误，而且是一种幻想。这样的结论会麻痹社会主义意识，但是远不能说是对真正原因已有了认识，因此远不能说正确地解决了问题。抱有这种观点的人甚至没有考虑到，自从匈牙利工人阶级愤怒爆发后，匈牙利社会主义进一步发展的出发点已经同1945年不同了。用这样的方法已经不能够解决问题了。这样做只会使匈牙利悲剧产生的原因变本加厉和日趋复杂。如果谁真正想找到和说明当前危机的实在原因，那就得设法去寻找和说明这个危机的真正原因。这就牵涉到社会主义中极其重要的一些问题，因此，真正珍视社会主义的人就不敢忽视真正原因。如果社会主义国家的领导力量没有足够的力量去保证通过进化过程来改变一个进行社会主义建设的社会中的某些政治形式和社会关系，那么就难免发生政治危机。对事件作客观的马克思主义分析的人可以根据第一种估价首先提出几个很实际的问题。首先，如果问题只在于拉科西—格罗集团所犯的某些“错误”，而不在于那种对社会主义发展已经开始起反动作用的官僚主义制度，那么为什么这回匈牙利劳动群众只有采用武力和拿起武器才能反对产生这些“错误”的政策呢？
    匈牙利工人阶级为什么没能够通过相应的代表机构，或者即使是通过匈牙利劳动人民党（它曾经被人说成是工人阶级最先进的队伍，而其实，它已经失去了同工人阶级的任何联系）以正常的方式来表达自己的愿望呢？最后，硬说工人阶级在获得自己胜利的第十一年跟着反革命跑了，这难道会使社会主义的良心感到宽慰吗？即使我们假定这是完全正确的，我们毕竟还应当提出这样一个问题：在这种情况下应该对工人阶级使用大棒呢，还是应该对把工人阶级弄到使它不得不起来反对自己的历史利益这种荒谬地步的政治制度使用大棒。
    然而，这种错误逻辑不能不使人得出一个同社会主义特别是同马克思主义丝毫不相干的荒谬结论：任何一个党或者是国家可以在没有工人阶级，甚至是违背它的意志的情况下建设社会主义。
    当前匈牙利的关键问题是必须从根本上改变政治制度
    从实质上来说，匈牙利工人阶级的自发行动毕竟是社会主义性质的，而且正是按照社会主义方式行事的。不错，在对国家制度、民主和党—政治关系的观念方面，它在很大的程度上受到了各种小资产阶级的抽象自由言词的影响，但在同时，它坚定地起来保卫生产资料的公有制。不仅如此，它通过组织工人委员会的方式进一步发展了这种成果，把这一所有制由国家所有制形式变成彻底的公有制形式，也就是变为归生产者大家庭的直接民主管理的所有制。值得注意的还有，工人群众主张建立统一的工人委员会和使它们自下而上地团结起来，以便造成条件来直接影响中央国家政权。这件事的本身就证明：匈牙利的工人阶级虽然思想上陷入了自发的混乱，但它实际上还是找到了取得政权的正确道路。
    当然，今天很难讲匈牙利工人阶级在为政权而继续进行的斗争过程中能不能保住在企业中的这一阵地。毫无疑问，必然会得到国外愈来愈大的支持的、复活了的资产阶级反动势力企图取得最后的胜利。他们在这方面的方针是很明确的。在第一个阶段，这些反动势力企图利用工人阶级在思想上和政治上的瓦解来重新夺取国家政权。在这个阶段，这些反动势力乐于泛泛地谈论自由和民主（这特别是因为他们很软弱）。一旦夺得政权以后，它们很自然地就会至少部分地取消生产资料的公有制，而且无论如何都会要限制工人委员会的作用和不断取消工人委员会。
    党在中央的一切垄断（不管是一个党或几个党）同生产者群众通过企业和公社中的工人委员会来实现的真正的决定作用是不相容的。因此，毫无疑问，匈牙利的新的“多党制度”很快就会同工人委员会发生冲突，这正像想重新建立某一个官僚化政党的旧式垄断的一切尝试目前的遭遇一样。
    可见，如果认为11月4日以后匈牙利的革命冲突已经走上了某种正常的发展道路，那就是巨大的错误和陷于片面了。恰恰相反，为匈牙利彻底的社会和政治管理形式进行的战斗，在那个时候才刚刚开始，并且，任何不愿意臆测的人都不能说这场战斗会怎样告终。当然，可能性最大的是社会主义力量保住了匈牙利社会的社会主义经济基础。但是不管怎样，工人阶级在通过斗争和失败获得经验以便老练地建立社会主义社会制度的新的民主结构以前，会不得不流大量的血和经受许多失望。此外，也不能排除另外一种可能性，那就是工人阶级和社会主义遭到严重失败，从而使匈牙利变成极端危险的国际冲突的对象。
    对苏联第二次干涉的看法
    对苏联的第二次干涉我们也是这样来看，不管这种干涉的出发点是什么。这里不仅考虑到人民有权自己解决自己内部的矛盾，同时还因为干涉（指在社会危机的时候）本身永远是解决不了问题的。干涉只能把这些问题的解决延缓一个时期，但它也会使问题尖锐化。在这种意义上讲，苏联在匈牙利的干涉的本身对匈牙利内部矛盾的解决也不会有任何帮助的。但是，如果这次干涉将阻碍内部政治制度的各种问题的解决，而这些问题的解决又是为希望保证匈牙利社会主义健康发展所必须的话，那么这次干涉无疑会使情况复杂起来，并且引起严重的后果。但是，我们同样认为有一种情况是可能的：那就是只要这种干涉能制止继续流血并且提供可能来组成这样一个政府和实行这样一种政策，这种政府和政策能在某种改变了的政治制度基础上把一切社会主义力量团结起来，并且保证工人阶级能通过工人委员会和工人阶级的其他类似机构，真正对国家政策产生过去没有产生过的影响，那末，在匈牙利具体条件下的苏联干涉的祸害，可能会小一些。只有这种积极的后果才能说明苏联的干涉是正确的。如果没有这些后果，那么干涉的行为本身也会受到历史的谴责。
    我们的这种态度今天处于两面夹攻中。有些人以无产阶级国际主义的名义，谴责我们没有无保留地支持苏联的干涉；另外一些人以不干涉别国内政的原则和民主原则的名义，非难我们没有无保留地反对这次干涉。
    与此同时，我们认为，在今天，当匈牙利社会处于这样深刻的内部危机的时候，苏联的干涉根本起不了决定作用。这次干涉不是错误的开始，而是错误的结果。因此，这次干涉并不能把匈牙利的社会主义从危机中挽救出来，而只是更清楚地表明拉科西—格罗时期的匈牙利政治形式是站不住脚的。
    我个人的意见是，在苏联干涉匈牙利期间，起着主要作用的不是社会主义问题。起着主要作用的是现今国际关系中的力量对比问题。一切稍有现实感的观察家都会得出一个结论：在今天的国际情况下，当匈牙利的内部发展已开始为其他方面的干涉创造了条件，即是说西方可能在匈牙利建立政治基地的时候，苏联的干涉是不可避免的。否则，那种局势会大大地破坏目前欧洲的力量对比，会严重破坏目前的均势，甚至会危害欧洲的和平。各种“自由欧洲”之类的机构，以及匈牙利的形形色色的狂热的民族主义领袖都证实了这类看法。毫无疑问，这种因素甚至对我们的态度也起了一定的作用，不要说苏联政府的态度了。因此，我们尽管对苏联在匈牙利的干涉和这种干涉对社会主义事业的后果感到十分忧虑，在谈到社会主义的时候，我们仍然认为，今天东欧的社会主义的命运，不决定于宣布拥护或是反对苏联的干涉，其理由很简单，因为这次干涉在相当程度上是由目前国际局势所引起的。
    实际上主要的和具有决定性的问题是在另一方面，这就是：在一个曾经发誓忠于社会主义的政府当政十一年之后，在一个被认为比较发达的、有雄厚的经济基础和强大的工人阶级的国家中，怎么会发生这样的事情呢，事情怎么会演变到恰恰是由这个阶级来发动武装斗争，怎么会使这种愤慨心情发展到要另外一个社会主义国家进行干涉呢。把这种过程称为革命也好，称为反革命也好，反正事实是这样：工人阶级，并且是多数，起来反对一个宣布自己为社会主义政权的政权，假如不是这样的话，那末从起义中就不会产生什么结果。现在也正是工人阶级在反对这种干涉所带来的东西，反对恢复旧制度和旧方法，毫无疑问，这些事实在一定程度上表明了拉科西—格罗政治制度的社会性质。
    因此，目前的匈牙利的主要问题正是某些国家共产党今天坚决否认的事实，并且正是今天应当谈一谈的问题。这就是必须彻底改变政治制度的问题，而不是撤换一些人和任命另外一些人和纠正个别错误的问题。只有在做到这一点之后，才能大大减小苏联干涉对社会主义所造成的消极影响。
    从这些前提出发，我们认为必须给卡达尔政府以政治上的支持，期待或是希望这个政府能够，并且乐意同工人阶级，即同工人委员会以及同匈牙利的其他真正民主和社会主义的派别、包括前纳吉政府人员建立联系。在这样的情况下，卡达尔政府就可以成为某种首先依靠工人委员会的社会主义民主力量集中的出发点，这才能建立自主的、并且是足够强大的、民主的、同时毫无疑问是社会主义的内部力量，这种力量能够建立秩序和人民的信任，能为苏军的撤退以及同苏联建立友好关系创造条件。只有在这种情况下，卡达尔政府才能在解决匈牙利的国内社会矛盾方面成为进步的、公正的因素。不然的话，即如果这个政府不采取这种方针，例如最近发生的某些情况（首先是南匈两国政府之间就不再给纳吉和其他人避难权一事达成的南匈协议遭到破坏，以及把这批人送往罗马尼亚去的事实），使人有理由严重地担心，这种趋向可能在匈牙利得胜。如果是这种情况，这种唯一的机会也会错过，匈牙利的社会主义就要再一次受到打击。这种发展就会使资产阶级民族主义作为一种主要的思想意识的动力而抬头，而劳动群众本身就会被引得更向右转了。
    因此，我们认为，这就是苏联干涉匈牙利所引起的主要问题。
    匈牙利的工人委员会
    在最近发生的匈牙利事件中最使人感到惊奇的是共产党员竟然害怕工人委员会。列宁曾经大胆地提出过“全部政权归苏维埃！”的口号，虽然当时布尔什维克在苏维埃里还不是多数。但是，列宁作为一个马克思主义者有充分根据预料到，劳动群众在感到对政权的责任的时候，他们的行动必然会符合自己的利益，亦即按照社会主义方式去工作。结果并没有错。在匈牙利，却没有人有勇气提出这种要求，连工人委员会也是这样，工人委员会受小资产阶级抽象的自由主义口号影响太大了。但是，不管工人委员会成了什么样子，它们总是唯一现实的社会主义力量，如果这种力量能在企业、自治单位和中央担负起掌执政权的主要责任，它可能很快就会摆脱有害的反社会主义的影响。由于匈牙利的共产党人过去和现在都没有以这样的态度对待工人委员会，而只是着重宣传必须开始工作，不提工人委员会的政权；这实质上是共产党人自己把工人委员会越来越严重地推向小资产阶级的和民族主义的冒牌民主分子和空话的影响下。
    事实就是这样。对这些事实熟视无睹或是保持缄默都无助于社会主义，无助于社会主义力量的团结。可见，把匈牙利事件估计为一次有组织的反革命，可能使个别人的社会主义良心人为地得到一点安慰，但是这种估计不能解决在匈牙利造成了流血悲剧的政治制度的内部问题。
    对匈牙利事件的第二种估计认为，凡是在自由和民主的幌子下提出来的东西都是有用的和进步的。在大街上和在知识分子的各种俱乐部里，空谈家们支持那些能最快地把这些口号变成无政府主义的谬论的人，忘记了喋喋不休的冒牌的爱好自由的空话的实际后果，不外乎是在人们的头脑中制造混乱，而后使他们服从真正反革命的同时完全是实际存在的派系；这些派系在这种空话的帮助下首先是企图偷运传统的多党制度，而后自己篡夺领导地位。
    我并不是说，很大一部分甚而可能是大部分主要持有这种枉然的抽象的自由主义的匈牙利知识分子，主观上不希望真正的民主和人道主义，也不是说反社会主义目标对他们是格格不入的（原文如此——译注）。然而，任何人为了领导革命运动，仅仅是真诚、爱自由和人道主义是不够的。他应当清楚，他所希望的是什么。但是，在提出了大量的枉然的宣言和口号的知识分子中间却没有一个人有才能和有勇气告诉群众，自由和民主的后面如果没有一定的社会力量对比，一定的社会结构，而在革命行动时没有一定的实际社会力量的话，它们是不可能实现的；同时没有告诉群众革命的主要问题首先就是建立这种力量，这种力量只能是社会主义力量，只有在此之后才能真正地谈到一定的民主政治制度和民主的一定的清晰内容。不过，在匈牙利知识分子的各种宣言中，关于这些问题考虑的太少了。在现实的物质社会力量的世界和基本物质利益和社会利益的世界正在他们身后发生激变和力量的重新集结的时候，他们只有一大堆口号、幻想。这个充满着物质的和社会的矛盾、利害关系和对立的世界归根结蒂一直决定着一切，其中也包括自由和民主的问题。谁忘记了这些事实，谁就会很快地被抛在一边。这里所讲的那些匈牙利民主知识分子集团恰恰是很快地就被抛到一边去了。这些知识分子只是看到了匈牙利过去的政治结构的不良后果，看不到同时也没有能力弄清楚它的原因和指出解脱这种局面的出路，来把社会主义和民主引向进步。这些知识分子不善于创造，而只是破坏。当这个工作已经做了，知识分子又采取了十九世纪虚伪的民主和民族主义传统的纲领。这实质上就是投降，是向斯大林主义和资产阶级制度的投降。这是承认自己完全软弱无力。但是在一点上这些知识分子仍然是前后一贯的：直到最后一刻，他们仍使工人委员会不能掌握真正的政权。他们在匈牙利各地建立或者是承认各种各样的伪革命委员会，但是他们没有一次曾经公开主张政权不应当交给一个或者多个已经破产了的党派，而是应当交给一个一定的机构，这个机构的核心应该是工人委员会、地方自治单位和社会主义公社。这样，在匈牙利知识分子的整个思想混乱中，仍然有某种前后一贯的东西。这种一贯性说明了，匈牙利这一部分知识分子的行动也是受到官僚主义、也就是官僚主义的物质和社会利益的强烈的思想影响的。
    在第一阶段，匈牙利知识分子曾经向格罗要求自由，而格罗老早就不把人看做是有意识的独立的生物了，在第二阶段，知识分子期望从恢复起来的资产阶级党派得到自由，而资产阶级党派的“民主传统”在过去早已为人们所深知了。同时，在任何一个阶段上，知识分子没有能够指出可以作为自由和民主的体现者的真正的社会力量，就像我已经说过，没有能够指出工人委员会、公社和其他类似的社会主义民主形式。
    在思想上这个运动的实质是空洞的，这个运动只是在社会主义社会基础上的深刻运动的表面的和被歪曲的反映。因而，这个运动最后归结为大批互相抵触的自由主义口号，其中有许多口号变成了空谈和幻想，有一些口号成了假面具，被利用来偷运各种反社会主义的纲领。某些匈牙利知识分子集团既然没有能够进行什么创造性的工作来在社会主义的基础上奠定新的道路，最后，只好从历史的破烂中找出旧的（它们再没有什么事情可以做的了）资产阶级政治机器和匈牙利旧的民族主义。匈牙利的革命悲剧正是在于，这些思想上空虚的分子随着形势的发展而成了革命的政治领导者，因为当时没有任何其他的领导。但是更大的悲剧是，当时在匈牙利没有任何其他的力量和社会主义意识的中心能够向匈牙利工人阶级提出某种其他的选择，叫它不要后退到资产阶级的政治制度或者斯大林主义的立场。
    必须改变政治制度，而不仅是撤换人和改变机构的名称
    在这种情况下，工人阶级的行动是自发的。但是只有工人阶级的行动是社会主义的和真正民主的，它建立起工人委员会，并且有着把这些委员会联合在全国统一的系统中的倾向。这就是匈牙利工人阶级在直接实践的范围内所能做到的一切。
    从工人阶级的多少带有自发性的活动中还明显地反映了这样一种倾向：工人阶级以工人委员会和工人委员会联合会的形式组织起来，就好像一个国家一样。这种倾向是自发地出现的，它既基于工人的切身利益，又出于以生产资料公有为基础的匈牙利社会的需要。这实际上就是摆脱匈牙利社会内部危机的唯一正确的社会主义出路。
    不幸，这个进程没有发展到底。主要原因当然是因为它缺乏自觉的方针和目标不明确。缺乏这样一种多少成熟的概念：孤立斯大林主义的和资产阶级的反动政治因素（它在小资产阶级无政府主义和冒牌自由主义的背后集中起来），通过把政权交给工人委员会的办法来改造匈牙利社会主义。此外，这个健康的工人阶级的社会主义结构受到了政治上、物质上和思想上的严重影响，这种影响一方面来自抱资产阶级民主幻想的人物，另一方面来自斯大林主义分子和教条，对前者来说工人委员会作为一种能够保证工人阶级和社会主义力量起领导作用的政治形式而起了阻碍他们的作用，对后者来说工人委员会限制了执政党的垄断。
    因此，可以毫不夸张地说，匈牙利劳动人民自发的激愤心情的主要特点是，革命的现实的社会主义主观因素没有发生任何影响，而这种因素本来是能够依据社会主义和社会主义民主的行动纲领推动工人阶级起来通过工人委员会和其他劳动人民群众自治机关进行争取政权的斗争。
    于是问题就发生了：匈牙利的社会主义怎么会遭受这么严重的思想失败？
    匈牙利的革命斗争实质上就是以暴力来清算社会主义进一步发展道路上的障碍的第一个鲜明的实例，这种障碍是某种根深蒂固的官僚政治制度的产物，而在某种情况下也是由资本主义向社会主义过渡时期自然的社会现象。但是这些社会主义民主形式和思想还刚刚萌芽，经验还很少，而社会发展本身不可避免地要求在政治制度和思想生活方面迅速取得进步。此外，一定制度的物质上和思想上的保守主义又以过去丰富的革命传统为口实，来抗拒这种进步。因此，在匈牙利现在发生的那种社会运动的情况之下，不自觉的自发的激愤情绪可能占上风，这种情绪基本上是健康的，但是只要缺乏明确的思想中心或根本缺乏主观因素的领导，那么在进一步发展的情况之下，这种情绪就可能导致严重的消极的后果和造成思想上和政治上的混乱。在革命事件当中，只要自发势力占了上风，幻想也就在人们的头脑中占优势，而实际行动却倒退向某些固有的而在目前加以理想化的旧形式。换言之，那些在混乱的时刻没有能够在森林中找到前进道路的人，首先开始向后转，然后甚至向后跑，尽管他们这样会使他们肇始的事业陷于悲惨结局。
    匈牙利发生的事情也就是这样。从前的拉科西—格罗政权以及占统治地位的斯大林主义教条不仅积累了大量社会矛盾，同时还使社会主义战士的头脑空无一物。在这个官僚主义制度中，广大真诚的革命者和社会主义战士受到这样的教育：即在革命胜利以后，主观因素只不过是去建立企业，无止境的投资，保证国家的收购，宣传政府的措施，尽量从国民经济中取得资金来尽量投资和尽可能达到最高的计划指标。置身在这个官僚制度中，任何一个政治家和党的活动家都不得不死记各种各样关于国民经济的数字，这些材料常常是没有什么重大意义的。但是，任何人都不能够、同时甚至没有特别感到有必要能够看到或者弄清楚，在人中间发生了什么？在发生着怎样的社会过程？出现了什么样的新的社会力量？什么社会力量正在衰亡？发生了什么矛盾？矛盾的形式怎样？什么地方出现了蜕变的趋向？什么地方的社会主义进展决定了旧东西的消灭等这一类问题，以便随后使经济政策也适合这些指标。
    但是，在这种制度下，人们对鸡和马铃薯品种要比对人更了解得多。可是，在这种条件下，政治就消失了，只剩下讨论计划数字、讨论钢和机器的生产、讨论马铃薯和玉蜀黍、讨论——如我已经说过的——饲养牲畜的方法等等。当然，我决不否认进行这种讨论（尤其是在专家中间）的必要性。但是，如果只限于这种讨论，那么这就是一个征兆，说明并不是一切都好。指导人们如何饲养牲畜的责任不能包括在一个社会主义国家的中央社会机关和政治机关的任务里。当然，它们应当保证有专门组织随时给予一切询问的人以专门技术和物质上的必要帮助。可是这些中央机关的主要任务无疑地应当是通过社会上的政治和经济组织机构，随时给各个岗位上的每个人以物质上和精神上的支持，以使他生产得更多、更好，同时给他们以充分的独立性，以使他们能全面地发挥自己的创造力和主动精神。当我们谈到社会主义建设的时候，假如我们要努力保证，使社会主义社会制度在它的发展中依靠社会主义的劳动人民的行动自由，而不是依赖于国家的力量的话，那么这一点应当是我们社会结构建设中的主要目的。
    我们始终强调，社会主义的建设（假使我们把这个不十分准确的、宣传的名词——社会主义建设——用来表示那些致力于发展社会主义关系的人们的自觉行动的话），在这种意义上的社会主义建设并不是像房子建设的那种过程。这不是可以在官僚主义的办公厅里指挥和领导的过程。社会主义建设是一个有机的社会过程，在这个过程中，领导力量应当只是致力于社会主义力量的解放和维护这种力量，防止各种因素的干扰。
    在这个过程中，有着各种社会力量，从过去的残余力量一直到过渡的新的现象，例如，官僚主义，它可能变成非常严重的社会力量。工人阶级本身正在社会主义发展过程中发生变化。工人阶级生存于其间的内部关系正在改变，工人阶级的觉悟也在改变。只通过社会主义革命的出发点这个角度，也就是说只通过无产阶级和资产阶级之间的冲突来理解社会主义发展的过程，在思想上是荒谬的，而在政治上则是反动的。由于这种观点，就产生了对共产党当权的国家里所存在的一切东西作不断的、自动的讴歌。似乎那里的所有社会问题都永远被解决了，也就是说，所有这些问题都可以按照法令去和平解决，并且每一个问题不用任何关心就能够等到这样的时刻：中央集权的行政机关的某个办公厅将认为，解决这个或那个问题的时候成熟了。遗憾的是，这个唯心主义公式不仅仅是讽刺，而且是现实。根据这个唯心主义公式，便断定，在过渡时期既不会经常不断地、每日每时地产生社会发展的良好结果，也不会经常不断地、每日每时地产生社会发展的不良结果。
    社会主义对自己的成果需要有健康的、民主的、批判的态度
    如果把过渡时期社会发展问题的讨论仅仅归结为被推翻了的资产阶级残余现象，那是非常错误的。在一个还比较发达的国家里，经过十年社会主义发展之后，这些残余应该是在政治上没有多大作用的因素。过渡时期的国家结构也产生着另一些因素，这些因素比上述因素重大得多，抗拒社会主义进步的历史反动势力也以新的形式在这些因素中体现了出来。正如我们大家都知道，这首先是官僚主义，这种官僚主义以斯大林主义和资产阶级民主主义的形式出现。只有当官僚主义专制同社会主义进一步发展的需要之间的冲突极端严重，以致引起工人阶级的愤怒和迫使它来向这种官僚主义进攻的时候，资产阶级的反革命力量才可能是严重的政治因素。不要忘记，法国反革命力量之得胜，不是靠他自己内部的力量，而只是在雅可宾党的恐怖政治完全与法国社会发展的实际需要和可能发生矛盾之后。反革命虽然表面上取得胜利，它却不能消灭那种对资本主义继续发展颇为重要的东西。但是在此以后，就不得不前后相继发生一连串的冲突和革命，这些冲突和革命逐渐清洗了政治体系中的那些阻碍社会迅速发展的因素。
    拉科西时期的匈牙利的特征是，对过渡时期的社会发展过程缺乏任何比较认真的分析，不但如此，在死刑的威胁下禁止讨论社会关系和其他一切不符合下列神话的问题，即正在建设社会主义的社会中除资产阶级残余外没有反动的和保守的因素。按照这个学说，匈牙利的发展是与政府的政策一致的，因此，政府应该享有绝对的权力。根据这种概念，宣传和解释政府的措施是自觉地愿意促进社会主义事业的人们的唯一任务。这也是社会科学的任务。根据这点，整个思想工作丧失了任何创造性的刺激，沦于无原则的实践主义的奴仆的可怜地位。
    产生了这样的问题：这种制度能够造就怎样的社会主义干部，它给社会主义的自发势力提供过那种可能性来纠正所谓领导力量的政策；总之，劳动人民群众的社会主义自觉——这种最终应当成为整个社会制度保持稳定的基础的自觉——怎样才能够形成呢？当然，在上述条件下，对所有这些问题的解答只能够是否定的。实际上，政治制度本身和按其地位说来应当是国内最进步的力量的政党本身，并没有培养出能够成为匈牙利社会主义进步倾向的表达者和代表者的干部。这样一来，群众和匈牙利劳动人民党的领导之间的裂痕就一发不可收拾，而匈牙利工人阶级在思想上被解除武装，并且受到四面八方来的各种思想的影响。
    只有这种不正常的情况才能解释：为什么裴多菲俱乐部这样一个包括各式各样知识分子（从特别进步的、社会主义的知识分子一直到小资产阶级无政府主义分子和公开反社会主义的反动分子）的团体在起初能够成为被压迫的人民群众唯一的精力发泄之所，而后成为主要的思想和政治指导者之一。
    这种不正常的政治形式本身和这个作为社会主义愤怒的主要思想力量的清谈俱乐部的活动，表现了拉科西—格罗的官僚主义制度留下来怎样一片思想上的荒芜。
    匈牙利工人委员会也是在这种思想气氛中发展起来的。我们已经看到，和它们对立的是拉科西—斯大林分子和小资产阶级自由主义。指责拉科西—格罗政权并且脱离这个政权的那些共产党员们也不了解它们。有一部分共产党员仍然处在旧的斯大林教条影响下并且已习惯于不信任群众、不信任工人阶级社会主义觉悟、不信任使工人阶级按照社会主义方式行动的物质上的必要性，他们不明白工人群众怎么能够直接地、而不是仅仅通过党或党的领导机构来参加政权系统和决定问题。在十年中间仅是仗着官僚主义的政治机构和经济机构统治国家的匈牙利劳动人民党瓦解了，正是由于这个缘故，它不再能成为现实的社会主义因素了。虽然如此，这个党只是改换了名称，企图使匈牙利劳动人民相信，这样问题就解决了。然而，匈牙利工人起来反对的是官僚主义制度，而不是反对建立这种制度的那个党的这种或那种名称。匈牙利进步的社会主义力量不必在恢复共产党和别的政党方面枉费心机，实质上在过去革命的日子里应当为直接民主的原则的胜利而战斗，其办法就是建立统一工人委员会和自治公社作为新的社会主义政权的主要基础。只有在这样的民主机构中社会主义力量才能重新再起，这样再起的力量才能再成为这种机构的直接要素。然而，僵化了的、过去的教条重担非常沉重地压在匈牙利共产党人的头上，他们不能作出这种彻底的转变；不管事情显得多么荒谬，共产党人宁愿转向传统的资产阶级多党制度——纵使这样会把匈牙利交付给反动势力——，也不愿放弃对自己的群众性政党的幻想，而事实上群众已离开了这个党，因为对群众来说这样的党是官僚专制的化身。在那些日子里匈牙利非常需要进步的争取社会主义的战士，但是需要的不是斯大林式的社会主义战士，也不是组织在旧政党（不论它用什么名称出现）内的社会主义战士。这些战士本应当在有工人阶级的地方、在工人阶级中间出现，而为了这一目的，必需找出新的组织形式和新的工作方法来。
    由于这种意见对匈牙利共产党领导人看来是异己的、并且因为他们无论如何也摆脱不掉陈旧的公式，在最顽固的斯大林分子初步孤立以后，他们中间又发生分裂。一部分人受到虚伪的爱好自由的口号和对资产阶级民主制度的美丽憧憬的影响，开始建立和工人委员会平行的、最终是反对工人委员会的政权，因为这两种形式是不能调和的。
    我们且不谈，在匈牙利的社会冲突如此尖锐的情况下，把希望寄托于某种传统的、和平的多党民主，是纯粹的幻想。即使实情不曾如此，人们仍然要问：为什么共产党人仍然陶醉于他们事实上已失去了的所谓群众性的党，而拒绝工人阶级和社会主义的真正力量？这种力量体现在工人委员会里，并且能成为新的政治结构——匈牙利社会主义民主、直接民主的中坚力量。当初如果这样对待匈牙利工人，他们是会明白的。但是一个恰恰由于不让真正马克思主义思想得到表达机会而遭到可怕的崩溃的政党，现在又在发展他们入党，他们就不能明白了。根据哪一点工人们能够相信旧的祸害不会重演？仅仅根据调换了人吗？没有的事。必须改变政治制度，而不是仅仅调换人和改变组织名称。
    另外一部分好共产党员眼看事态发展到资产阶级复辟势力真正越来越嚣张的程度，就给吓慌了。同样的恐惧心理麻痹了工人阶级的大部分，并且使他们变得消极被动，这些工人那时已经不能从纳吉政府看见自己的前途，同时又害怕再回到老的、斯大林主义的路上去。因此就有一部分共产党员从纳吉政府中分裂出来，他们有的变成消极旁观，有的到苏联军队中避难。对这一部分共产党员说来，革命的工人委员会是一种异己的机构，这种机构据说威胁共产党在政权结构中的地位，因此它不能作为建设新的社会主义政治制度的起点。后来苏联的干涉和亚诺什·卡达尔政府的成立便是这种局面的必然的结果。
  社会主义最重要的问题必须公开讨论
    我上面已经说过，考虑到匈牙利的整个局势，事前已经很明白：当匈牙利成为另一方面的干涉的场所时，便不可避免地产生苏联的干涉。而匈牙利开始成为这样的场所是从这个时候起，即拉科西的旧的政治结构没有用真正进步的、民主的、社会主义结构代替，而开始用一种老的、在匈牙利的条件下不能接受的、资产阶级国家（即生产资料私有制国家）的政治结构来代替。那样的匈牙利不可能成为独立的匈牙利。那样的匈牙利便会破坏欧洲原有的力量对比，从而会引起敌对的国际力量之间的冲突的尖锐化。
    由于从来没有一个严肃的共产主义派别能够就工人委员会——匈牙利社会主义的革新的政治结构的中坚力量——的作用、任务和目的提出一个明确纲领，甚至没有企图这样做过，工人委员会越来越受各式各样假民主口号的影响，这些口号追求的目的实质上是把工人委员会同政权隔离开来，使工人委员会的作用仅限于在不依赖工人委员会而建立的国家机器中作为工人的某种政治工会代表。甚至在初期以特别真诚和进步的态度对待工人委员会的那些匈牙利知识分子也没能起决定性的积极作用，相反的，却往往因为他们辨不清方向而使工人阶级迷失方向。由于这些知识分子除了要恢复旧的资本主义结构以外，没有能力提出什么新的东西来代替拉科西的制度，这些知识分子便把工人委员会抛在一边，使工人委员会丧失了任何前途，简直时常把它们变成进行实际抵抗和拟定标榜民主的政治纲领的大本营，并且越来越向反革命势力让步了。
    因此，应该到这些因素中去寻找匈牙利悲剧的原因，寻找社会主义民主的愿望在这次起义中遭到失败的原因。不过，我的意思并不是说，作为起义原因的进步趋势也受到了失败。也许，它们根据自己的经验以及在它们不得不和反动势力作的斗争中慢慢会对工人委员会中的社会主义愿望和民主愿望的总和得到更加明确的概念。但是事件发展得比新意识形成的过程还要快，因此工人委员会的整个体系便陷于不成熟和瘫痪状态中了。
    此外，应该注意到，进步的社会主义力量太缺乏克服官僚主义的经验，还谈不上能从其中最后总结出一种民主政治的形式。在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会以前，实际上只有南斯拉夫比较认真地探求并且找到了某种从政治上解决过渡时期矛盾的办法，在社会生活的各个方面建立了群众的自治机构，从而使社会摆脱了官僚主义分子力图借以使整个社会陷于停滞不前的那些政治形式和方法。当然，我们谁也没有说，我们所做的一切对所有的人都是唯一可行的和最好的，——最近四面八方都这样责难我们。我们所说的、以及铁托同志最近在他的演说（这篇演说遭到了很多的攻击）中所说的只是一个事实：南斯拉夫的社会主义第一个开始通过逐步改变整个政治制度的办法来把官僚主义当作一种社会势力加以彻底清算；任何一个社会主义国家都不能避免这个任务，如果它希望清除道路以使人们之间的社会主义关系和民主关系得以不受阻碍地发展的话。自然，每一个国家都将自行确定这条道路。由此可见，只有生活和今后的发展通过种种成功和失败才可以给社会主义国家最进步的社会力量提供必要的经验和必要的理论结论，来保证社会主义在进步的社会主义觉悟的日益强烈的影响下进一步发展。这是一个先决条件，它可以保证将来避免匈牙利式的流血事件和危机，它可以保证社会主义和民主的发展是真正地在不断地逐步演进的条件下实现的，而不是在严重的社会动荡的条件下实现的。
    假如这些都是对的话，那末就很明显，我们没有权利对现代社会主义最重要的问题熟视无睹，不论是我们，不论是其他珍视社会主义的人都没有这个权利。用不着马克思主义者也能够知道：匈牙利事件不是偶然的，不是用于反共宣传的数亿美元所产生的后果。只有共产主义运动中的保守的人们才重复上面的论调，并且以此自慰；他们简直像鸵鸟一样想把头藏在沙子里，等候不愉快的日子过去。当然，他们是错误的。不愉快的日子并不会这样容易地过去，因为他们有深刻的根源。如果个别的共产党继续欺骗自己和欺骗跟随他们走的那一部分群众，那么，这些日子毫无疑问将会重演。
    无论如何，我们的历史责任是：我们作为马克思主义者，应该毫不犹豫地、无偏见地、不顾及一切地正视事实。首先必须深刻地分析导致匈牙利起义和东欧类似现象的原因，并且作出结论，以帮助社会主义力量更迅速、更彻底地摆脱斯大林专制的遗产。同样地，必须根据以往的经验就过渡时期社会运动的结构作出一些总的结论，因为恰恰在这里，斯大林的某种理论和这种理论在各个社会主义国家的强制运用带来了最大的危害。
    建设性的、同志式的和社会主义的讨论只会有助于像在匈牙利发生的那种自发过程不再重演。这样做是特别必须的，因为匈牙利悲剧令人信服地证明，这个事件不仅对社会主义是个打击，并且对欧洲和世界和平也是一种危险。为了社会主义和社会主义民主的继续发展，和平高于一切。
    我不想谈匈牙利未来发展的前途。很明显，匈牙利最近所采取的措施从历史的角度看是否正确，那就要看匈牙利以后的政治、社会关系是否按照我上面所说的方向发展了。如果是企图恢复过去的政治制度（即使它的粗暴程度比较小一些）的趋势赢得了胜利，那么问题将不能解决，历史和匈牙利的劳动人民，迟早将要指责匈牙利当权的和在野的起决定作用的分子今天的政治行为，因为，在这过渡时期中，他们没有在社会主义、社会主义民主和独立的基础上找到一条取得一致的道路。　（文内插题是原有的）
