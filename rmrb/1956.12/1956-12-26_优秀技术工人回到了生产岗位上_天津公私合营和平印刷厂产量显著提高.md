Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 25th (Xinhua News Agency Reporter Meng Fan reports): In the Tianjin Joint State-Private Peace Printing Factory, excellent technical workers who had been transferred to management positions are now playing a significant role after being reassigned to their original production posts.

After four individuals, including Xing Bozhong, a seventh-grade machine operator in charge of personnel and wages, and Wu Zhongqiu, a sixth-grade platemaker in charge of statistics, returned to their original positions, the technical strength of the workshop increased, and the number of production stations increased from twelve to fourteen, resulting in a 16% increase in monthly output. Among them, platemaker Wu Zhongqiu also successfully researched and produced centimeter grid paper for printing designs or drawings, adding a new product to the factory. He also refurbished two unusable old printing plates, saving man-hours and raw materials for making new plates. After Ni Yongchang, who was in charge of statistics, reassumed his position as the leader of the cutting group, he and the workers studied and changed the labor organization, increasing output by 20% and reversing the previous phenomenon of frequently failing to meet the plan.

After the implementation of joint state-private ownership in the Peace Printing Factory, the leading cadres mechanically applied the management methods of state-owned enterprises, established four sections and offices, including personnel and business, and successively transferred five excellent technical workers to do general management work, weakening the technical strength of the workshop. Now, the factory has timely changed its past practices and has achieved good results.

    优秀技术工人回到了生产岗位上
    天津公私合营和平印刷厂产量显著提高
    新华社天津25日电　新华社记者孟帆报道：天津市公私合营和平印刷厂一度调做管理干部的优秀技术工人，在调回到原来的生产岗位上去以后，发挥了很大作用。
    做人事工薪工作的七级领机工邢伯忠和做统计工作的六级制版工吴仲秋等四人回到原来的工作岗位以后，车间的技术力量增加了，生产班台由原来的十二个增加到十四个，使每月产量提高了16％。其中，制版工吴仲秋还研究印制设计或绘图用的厘米格纸成功，给工厂增加了一种新产品；他还把两块不能用的旧胶版翻新，节省了做新版的工时和原材料。做统计工作的倪永昌重新担任裁切组长以后，同工人们研究改变了劳动组织，使产量提高20％，扭转了过去计划经常不能完成的现象。
    和平印刷厂实行公私合营以后，领导干部曾经机械地搬用国营企业的管理方法，增设人事、业务等四个科股，先后抽调了五名优秀技术工人做一般的管理工作，削弱了车间的技术力量。现在这个厂及时地改变了过去的做法，收到了很好的效果。
