Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 14th: This year, Shandong Province's winter production has been slow. By the end of November, the winter-plowed area only reached 56% of the arable land, while it had reached 89% in the same period last year. The progress of winter watering of wheat in various places is also slow, with only one-sixteenth of the irrigable land currently watered; manure accumulation is not being done well; very little farmland water conservancy construction is being carried out, and many places are unwilling to build wells or reservoirs anymore.

Why is it that in Shandong Province, which achieved an all-round bumper harvest of grain and cotton in the first year after cooperativization, there is a phenomenon of slow progress in winter production? Xinhua News Agency reporters interviewed the leaders of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee on this issue. They analyzed the reasons for this phenomenon and put forward ways to change this situation.

The leaders said: The main reason for the slow progress of winter production, from the perspective of cadres, is that after criticizing subjectivism, many rural work cadres dare not work boldly. They are afraid of making mistakes of subjectivism and commandism, and are hesitant in their work. Therefore, they are hesitant to lead this year's winter production. From the perspective of the masses, it is because the year-end distribution work of agricultural cooperatives in various places is progressing slowly, and cooperative members are uncertain whether they will be able to increase their income; in addition, some economic problems and production management problems left over from some cooperatives have not been resolved well. Therefore, many agricultural cooperative members are in low spirits and lack enthusiasm for production. As a result, winter production has been delayed.

The leaders pointed out when talking about changing this situation and launching a major production campaign this winter and next spring: At present, education should first be carried out extensively among cadres to make them realize that the farmland capital construction and various agricultural production technology reforms since last winter have achieved great results. It has played a direct role in this year's all-round bumper harvest of crops in the province, and will continue to play a role in the future development of agriculture. We must not adopt a skeptical and negative attitude because some mistakes and shortcomings have occurred in our work. At the same time, we must help cadres at all levels correctly analyze and understand the experiences and lessons learned from rural work since last winter. Regarding shortcomings and errors, we should study the causes and overcome and improve them from a positive perspective. Correct things should still be actively promoted in this winter's work. Now, party committees at all levels should summarize a number of successful experiences in promoting farmland capital construction and agricultural production technology reforms, and actively promote them to promote agricultural production this winter and next spring.

The leaders pointed out: Taking production as the center, we must also quickly do a good job in the year-end distribution work of agricultural cooperatives, and distribute all the income the masses should get to them. If the cooperatives whose output has been reduced have difficulties in their production and the lives of their members after repaying the state loans, they can also be taken care of in terms of the amount and time limit for loan repayment. At the same time, the funds for production investment and means of production of cooperative members should be repaid if they should be repaid, and as much as possible should be repaid. It is also necessary to rationally arrange production and labor, and allow cooperative members a certain amount of free time. In this way, the production enthusiasm of cooperative members will be greatly increased.

The leaders finally said that now that "Heavy Snow" has passed, winter plowing can no longer be carried out in some places. We must start to seize the opportunity to accumulate manure and prepare for water conservancy and sideline production next spring, and lead the masses to quickly develop winter production.

This newspaper, Lanzhou, December 16th: At present, winter production work in rural areas of Gansu Province has begun, and some places have achieved initial results. However, judging from the overall situation, the enthusiasm of farmers in Gansu Province for winter production this year is not strong enough. So far, the number of autumn-turned land this year is not as high as in the same period last year, the amount of manure accumulated is not as high as last year, there is not much autumn afforestation, and agricultural capital construction has been reduced even more.

The most important reason for this phenomenon is that some cadres have neglected the achievements of this year's agricultural production and have one-sidedly exaggerated the shortcomings. They are hesitant, have many concerns, dare not put forward production plans and targets, and dare not actively lead the masses to carry out production. At the same time, some leading organs' cadres are satisfied with the achievements of this year's agricultural production, blindly optimistic, unwilling to go deep into reality, and do not actively solve the problems in winter production.

In order to correct this slow winter production phenomenon, the Rural Work Department of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee, the Gansu Provincial People's Committee's Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Gansu Provincial Democratic Women's Federation issued a joint notice to party and government leading organs and agricultural cooperatives at all levels throughout the province to actively carry out winter production. The notice called on party and government leading organs at all levels to actively lead farmers to carry out winter production work, and vigorously reverse the current slackening of thought in production work. Combine the work of transferring to cooperatives and autumn harvest distribution to mobilize the masses to carry out the winter production movement.

The notice pointed out that due to the widespread lack of rain throughout the province this autumn, the work of drought resistance and prevention next year should be highly valued and fully prepared.

The notice finally requested that all localities do a good job in the six most important tasks in winter: (1) Do a good job in winter irrigation, ice collection, snow accumulation, and soil moisture conservation and drought resistance; (2) Make necessary repairs, supplements, and reinforcements to this year's water conservancy projects, and at the same time, build new farmland water conservancy projects in accordance with local conditions; (3) Launch a mass manure accumulation movement; (4) Develop sideline production in a planned manner; (5) Do a good job in forestry work; (6) Do a good job in protecting livestock to ensure safe wintering.

The notice hoped that leading organs at all levels would go deep into reality, strengthen inspection and supervision, so as to be able to discover problems in a timely manner and solve problems in a timely manner, so as to ensure the smooth progress of winter production work.

### 提高农村干部工作信心，做好农业社年终分配  山东甘肃努力扭转冬季生产迟缓现象

    提高农村干部工作信心，做好农业社年终分配
    山东甘肃努力扭转冬季生产迟缓现象
    新华社济南14日电　今年山东省的冬季生产进展迟缓。到11月底，冬耕面积仅达可耕地的56％，而去年同期已达89％。各地冬浇小麦的进度也是不快的，目前仅浇可浇地的十六分之一；积肥工作搞得不好；农田水利建设搞得很少，许多地方不愿再打井、修水库了。
    为什么在合作化后第一年粮棉获得全面丰收的山东省，会发生冬季生产进展迟缓的现象呢？新华社记者就这个问题访问了中共山东省委和省人民委员会负责人，他们分析了产生这种现象的原因，并且提出了改变这种状况的办法。
    负责人说：冬季生产进展迟缓的主要原因，从干部方面看，是因为批判主观主义以后，许多农村工作干部不敢大胆工作，他们怕犯主观主义、强迫命令的错误，工作上缩手缩脚。因此，对今年冬季生产的领导踌躇不前。从群众看，是因为各地农业社的年终分配工作进展缓慢，合作社社员对自己是否能够增加收入心中无底；又加有些合作社遗留的经济问题和生产管理问题没有很好解决，因此，不少农业社社员情绪不高，生产劲头不足。这样，冬季生产就拖下来了。
    负责人在谈到改变这种状况发动今冬和明春大生产的时候指出：当前首先应该在干部中广泛的进行教育，使他们认清：去冬以来的农田基本建设和各项农业生产技术改革是有很大成绩的，它对今年全省农作物的全面丰收起了直接的作用，而且对今后发展农业将是经常起作用的因素。不能因为工作中产生了一些错误和缺点，就采取怀疑和否定的态度。同时要帮助各级干部正确地分析认识去冬以来农村工作中的经验和教训。对缺点和错误，应该研究产生的原因，从积极方面来加以克服改进，对正确的东西，仍要积极地在今冬工作中加以推行。现在，各级党委应该总结一批推行农田基本建设和农业生产技术改革中的成功经验，并且积极加以推广，以推动今冬明春的农业生产。
    负责人指出：以生产为中心，还必须迅速做好农业社的年终分配工作，把群众应该分得的全部分给他们；减产的社如果偿还国家贷款以后，社的生产和社员的生活有困难，也可在贷款归还的数量和期限上加以照顾。同时，社员的生产投资和生产资料的款项，该还的要还，能还一部就还一部；并且要合理地安排生产和人力，让社员有一定的自由活动的时间，这样，社员的生产积极性就会高涨起来。
    负责人最后说，目前，“大雪”已过，有些地方冬耕已不能进行了，必需着手抓紧积肥和明春的水利准备工作和副业生产，领导群众把冬季生产迅速地开展起来。
    本报兰州16日电　目前甘肃省农村的冬季生产工作已经开展起来了，有些地方已获得了初步的成绩。但是从整个情形来看，今年甘肃省农民冬季生产的劲头还不够足。到目前为止，今年秋翻地的数量没有去年同时期多，积肥的数量也赶不上去年，秋季造林也不多，农业基本建设更是减少了。
    产生这种现象的最主要的原因是有些干部忽视了今年农业生产中成绩的一面，片面地夸大了缺点。他们缩手缩脚，顾虑多端，不敢提出生产计划和指标，也不敢积极领导群众进行生产。同时某些领导机关的干部满足于今年农业生产的成绩，盲目乐观，不肯深入实际，不积极地解决冬季生产中的问题。
    为了纠正这种冬季生产的迟缓现象，中共甘肃省委农村工作部、甘肃省人民委员会农林厅、青年团甘肃省委员会和甘肃省民主妇女联合会，向全省各级党政领导机关和农业社发出积极开展冬季生产的联合通知。通知中号召各级党政领导机关要积极领导农民开展冬季生产工作，大力扭转当前生产工作中的松劲思想。结合转社、秋收分配等工作，发动广大群众开展冬季生产运动。
    通知指出，由于全省今秋普遍缺雨，对于明年的抗旱防旱工作，应该高度重视并且做好充分的准备。
    通知最后要求各地做好冬季最主要的六项工作：（一）做好冬灌背冰积雪和保墒抗旱等工作；（二）对今年的水利工程要进行必要的整修补充和加固，同时要因地制宜地兴修新的农田水利工程；（三）要开展群众性积肥运动；（四）要有计划地开展副业生产；（五）要作好林业工作；（六）要做好保护牲畜安全过冬的工作。
    通知希望各级领导机关要深入实际，加强检查和督促，做到能及时发现问题和及时解决问题，以保证冬季生产工作的顺利进行。
