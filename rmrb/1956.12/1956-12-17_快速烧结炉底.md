    The Anshan Iron and Steel Company has successfully tested a new technology for the rapid sintering of open-hearth furnace bottoms. Recently, at the No. 19 open-hearth furnace in the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant, the furnace bottom was sintered successfully in only 62 hours and 42 minutes. Previously, sintering the bottom of a large open-hearth furnace took an average of 204 hours, and a medium-sized open-hearth furnace took an average of 218 hours. Now, using the rapid sintering method, the average sintering time for the eight open-hearth furnace bottoms is only 80 hours and 47 minutes. A total of 1,008 hours have been saved, which can increase steel production by more than 21,000 tons, while also saving more than 8 million cubic meters of gas and 1,200 man-hours.

    This advanced technology was jointly researched by Anshan Iron and Steel and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and successfully tested with the help of Soviet experts. Chief Foreman Jin Fuchen also offered many suggestions.

    快速烧结炉底
    鞍山钢铁公司试验成功一种平炉快速烧结炉底的新技术，最近在第二炼钢厂的十九号平炉上，只用六十二小时四十二分钟就把炉底烧结成功。以前烧结一座大型平炉的炉底，平均需要二百零四小时，中型平炉平均需要二百一十八小时；现在采用快速烧结方法烧结的八座平炉炉底，平均每座烧结时间只要八十小时零四十七分钟。一共节省了一千零八小时，可以增产二万一千多吨钢，同时节省了八百多万立方公尺的煤气和一千二百个人工。
    这项先进技术是鞍钢同中国科学院共同研究，并且在苏联专家的帮助下试验成功的；总工长金福臣也提出了不少的建议。
