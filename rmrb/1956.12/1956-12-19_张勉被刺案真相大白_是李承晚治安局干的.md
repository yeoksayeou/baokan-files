Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 18th: Seoul dispatch: Kim Sang-peng, who assassinated South Korean Vice President Chang Myon on September 28th of this year, revealed yesterday in the Seoul District Court that he was acting on the orders of Lee Syngman's Bureau of Public Safety. When he fired the gun, several plainclothes policemen were also present to monitor him.

Kim Sang-peng accused Lee Syngman's Bureau of Public Safety of plotting the assassination of Chang Myon. After Kim Sang-peng exposed the truth, the Bureau of Public Safety hurriedly denied it, and the Seoul District Court judge immediately announced that the trial would be suspended indefinitely.

(Editor's note) The dictatorial rule of Lee Syngman, supported by the United States, has never allowed any opposition faction to gain a foothold in the "parliament" and "government." In May of this year, the US-Lee group had to allow Chang Myon to be elected as South Korea's "Vice President" in order to decorate a facade of democracy.

Chang Myon had served as South Korea's "ambassador" to the United States and "Prime Minister," and was also a loyal tool of the United States. However, because he competed with Lee Syngman for power and became one of the leaders of the "opposition" Democratic Party, he was hated by Lee Syngman. On September 28th of this year, after Chang Myon delivered a speech at the Democratic Party's congress in Seoul, he encountered Lee Syngman's poisonous hand and almost lost his life. For this reason, the Democratic Party in the "parliament" at the time demanded a vote of no confidence in the "Minister of Home Affairs," but Lee Syngman's Liberal Party used high-pressure tactics to force the "parliament" to postpone the vote on this motion.

    张勉被刺案真相大白
    是李承晚治安局干的
    据新华社平壤18日电　汉城消息：今年9月28日行刺南朝鲜副总统张勉的金相鹏昨天在汉城地方法院揭露，他是奉李承晚治安局的命令干的，当他开枪的时候，还有几个便衣警察在场监视着。
    金相鹏指责李承晚的治安局策划了暗杀张勉的计划。在金相鹏暴露了事情真相以后，治安局急忙予以否认，汉城地方法院法官立即宣布审讯工作无定期地停止。
    （编者注）在美国支持下的李承晚独裁统治，一直不容许任何反对派插足在“议会”和“政府”里。今年5月间，美李集团为了装饰民主的花招，不得不让张勉当选为南朝鲜的“副总统”。
    张勉曾担任过南朝鲜的驻美“大使”和“国务总理”，也是美国的忠实工具，但因同李承晚争权，做了“反对派”民主党的首脑之一，就遭到李承晚的仇视。今年9月28日，张勉在汉城民主党代表大会发表演说后，遇到了李承晚的毒手，差点丢了命。为此，当时民主党在“议会”曾要求对“内务部长官”投不信任票，李承晚的自由党用高压手段使“议会”推迟了这个动议的表决。
