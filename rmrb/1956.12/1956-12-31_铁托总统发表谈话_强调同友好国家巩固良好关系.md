Xinhua News Agency, December 30th - According to the Yugoslav News Agency: Yugoslav President Tito, in a conversation with a reporter from "Borba," expressed his belief that the overall world situation would improve in the coming year. He said that he held an optimistic attitude towards the further development of international affairs.

    In a conversation published in the December 30th "Borba," Tito also said that we should not draw pessimistic conclusions from the recent various events. The situation in international relations can and must improve, and every effort should be made so that these efforts will bear fruit in the coming year. Tito said that he believed there was a realistic prospect that the solution of various outstanding issues would be easier in 1957. He said that the basic thing was to defend world peace, because the entire development of the situation depended on this.

    President Tito then pointed out that the main direction of Yugoslavia's foreign policy was to contribute as much as possible to easing current international contradictions. In this regard, Yugoslavia is striving to develop, deepen, and consolidate good relations with all countries, both East and West. The development of this relationship constitutes the active co-existence that is now playing a role, and Yugoslavia is contributing its utmost strength to the active efforts to maintain world peace with this active co-existence.

    Tito pointed out that no differences (whether political or ideological in nature) should be allowed to weaken this relationship. Tito declared that if the discussions between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union on some ideological issues had a negative impact on relations between the two countries, it would be very wrong. He said that Yugoslavia had established good friendly relations with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union and Yugoslavia have many similarities in their views on some political issues, but at the same time, there are some ideological differences. These differences will continue to exist in the future, so discussions will be held, but this must not become an obstacle to the fruitful and comprehensive development of mutual relations between the two countries.

    President Tito believed that the relations between countries should be clearly distinguished from the relations between parties, and it is especially necessary to distinguish the discussions on ideological issues from the cooperation between countries. Tito also said that because the party and the state cannot be confused. In Yugoslavia, not only does the party exist, nor are all citizens communists. In Yugoslavia, the state is broader than the party. Therefore, the relationship between parties is one thing, and the relationship between countries is another. If there are ideological differences that become the subject of discussion, people should emphasize that this discussion is between the two parties, so it should never be allowed to affect the development of relations between countries.

    Regarding this point, Tito said that Yugoslavia does not approve of any loud and clamorous disputes, but rather approves of serious and realistic discussions, regardless of what others may think about this. It is precisely because the Yugoslavs oppose emotionalism and disputes that may cause negative consequences that they believe there is no need to pay attention to the various attacks on Yugoslavia that appear in some newspapers.

    Tito expressed satisfaction with the fact that Chinese newspapers published in full the speech he delivered in Pula and the speech delivered by Kardelj in the Federal National Assembly. Tito said that this was good because it gave Chinese communists and the public the opportunity to understand Yugoslavia's views on the issues discussed in these speeches. As for whether the Chinese are criticizing various parts of these speeches, he believes it is not of great importance.

    Regarding the situation in Hungary, President Tito believes that the most important thing now is to help calm the situation in the country, because this is a basic prerequisite for positive development.

    Tito said that the situation in Poland has very positive developments, and he expressed his belief that its development will help consolidate peace and also help consolidate socialism. When talking to Jože Smole, the international political editor of "Borba," Tito touched upon some issues concerning Yugoslavia's current domestic situation. He pointed out that Yugoslavia's political situation is very good, the unity between the various ethnic groups in Yugoslavia is very solid, and they all actively support their country's policies.

    Tito pointed out that Yugoslavia has good prospects for making great strides in all aspects, especially in improving the living standards of the people—for which realistic material conditions have already been created. He said that it is also for this reason that he is very optimistic about the New Year.

    铁托总统发表谈话
    强调同友好国家巩固良好关系
    新华社30日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社讯：南斯拉夫总统铁托对“战斗报”记者发表谈话，表示相信明年世界总局势将有改善。他说，他对于国际事态进一步发展的前景是抱乐观态度的。
    铁托在发表于12月30日“战斗报”上的谈话中又说，我们不应该从最近的各种事件中得出悲观的结论。国际关系中的情况能够而且必须改善，应该尽一切努力来使这些努力会在明年获得成果。铁托说，他认为存在着这样的现实前景，就是：在1957年内，各个悬而未决的问题的解决会容易一些。他说，基本的事情是保卫世界和平，因为整个事态发展是取决于此的。
    铁托总统接着指出：南斯拉夫外交政策的主要方针是对缓和目前的国际矛盾作出尽可能多的贡献。在这方面，南斯拉夫正在努力发展、加深和巩固同东西方一切国家的良好关系。这种关系的发展构成了现在在起作用的积极共处，南斯拉夫正在以这种积极共处对维护世界和平的积极努力贡献出最大的力量。
    铁托指出：绝不能让任何分歧
  （不管是政治性质的还是意识形态性质的分歧）来削弱这种关系。铁托宣称：如果南斯拉夫和苏联在一些意识形态问题上的讨论对国与国之间的关系发生了消极的影响，那就十分错误的了。他说，南斯拉夫已经同苏联建立了良好的友好关系。苏联和南斯拉夫对一些政治问题的看法有着许多类似之处，但是同时也有着一些意识形态性质的分歧。这种分歧在将来还会存在，因此将进行讨论，但是这不得成为妨碍两国之间的相互关系的有成果的和全面的发展的一个障碍。
    铁托总统认为，应当明确地把国与国之间的关系同党与党之间的关系区别开来，特别需要把有关意识形态问题的讨论同国与国之间的合作区别开来。铁托又说，因为不能把党和国家混为一谈。在南斯拉夫，不仅有党存在，也不是所有的公民都是共产党人。在南斯拉夫，国家比党要广泛些。因此，党与党之间的关系是一回事，国与国之间的关系是另一回事，如果有了意识形态性质的分歧，成了讨论的题目，人们就应当强调指出，这种讨论是两个党之间的，因此决不可以让这影响国与国之间关系的发展。
    关于这一点，铁托说，南斯拉夫不赞成任何大叫大嚷的争论，而是赞成进行认真的、现实的讨论，不怕别人对这方面有些什么意见。正是因为南斯拉夫人反对可能引起消极后果的意气用事和争论，他们才认为没有必要注意某些报纸上出现的对南斯拉夫的各种攻击。
    铁托对中国报纸全文刊载他在普拉发表的演说以及卡德尔在联邦国民议会发表的演说表示满意。铁托说，这是好的，因为这样做，中国共产党人和公众可以有机会了解南斯拉夫对于这些演说中所谈到的问题的看法。至于中国人是不是批评这些演说中的各个部分，他认为是没有多大重要性的。
    关于匈牙利局势，铁托总统认为现在最重要的是要帮助使这个国家的局势平静下来，因为这是一种积极发展的基本的先决条件。
    铁托说，波兰的局势有很积极的发展，他表示相信它的发展会有助于巩固和平，同时也有助于巩固社会主义。　　铁托在同“战斗报”国际政治编辑约泽·斯莫尔谈话的时候谈到南斯拉夫当前国内局势方面的一些问题，他指出，南斯拉夫的政治局势很好，南斯拉夫各族人民之间团结很巩固，他们都积极支持他们国家的政策。
    铁托指出，南斯拉夫有在各方面，特别是在改善人民生活水平——已经为此创造了现实的物质条件——大踏步前进的良好前景，他说，也因为这一方面的理由，他对新年抱有很大的乐观态度。
