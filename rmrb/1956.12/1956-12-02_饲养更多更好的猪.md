　　Longyou produces more than 200,000 piglets annually
    Longyou County, Zhejiang Province, which is famous for producing the "Longyou Black" breed of piglets, now raises about 11,000 sows, nearly double the number in the same period last year. On average, there is one sow for every five households in the county. These sows can produce more than 200,000 piglets a year.
    In the past three months, people from Shangrao Prefecture and Gannan Administrative Region in Jiangxi Province, as well as more than 20 counties including Jiaxing in Zhejiang Province, have come to Longyou County to purchase piglets. Farmers have already sold about 30,000 piglets. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　Yushan sows farrow five times in two years
    Yushan County, Jiangxi Province, a famous piglet producing area, has bred more than 130,000 piglets this year, 70% more than the highest breeding volume in the past in 1952. In addition to meeting the needs of local farmers, 54,000 of these piglets can be supplied to farmers in other areas. Most of them have already been supplied.
    After Yushan County achieved advanced agricultural cooperation this year, it encouraged farmers to raise more sows and breed piglets in many ways. According to statistics, the county raised more than 10,000 sows this year, an increase of 40% compared to last year. Most sows have increased from breeding twice a year in the past to breeding five times in two years, thus greatly increasing the output of piglets. (Xinhua News Agency)

    New Policy, New Methods
    Local state-owned farms in various prefectures and counties in Jiangxi Province have decided to vigorously implement the policy of focusing on breeding and promoting fine breeds of piglets, replacing the past policy of focusing on raising commercial pigs. This was unanimously agreed upon at the provincial symposium on pig farming held by the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture on November 18.
    Local state-owned farms will reorganize existing breeding pig herds, actively and steadily expand breeding pig herds, and use scientific management methods to breed fine breeds of piglets. According to the current breeding capacity of breeding pigs in local state-owned farms, approximately 38,000 piglets can be bred within a year.
    In the past, local state-owned farms in Jiangxi Province focused on raising fattened pigs in the development of the pig industry, neglecting the breeding and promotion of fine breeds of piglets. Agricultural cooperatives in various places generally felt that the farms could not meet their needs for fine breeds of piglets. Yi Ruisheng and Peng Guangxian, model agricultural laborers from Pingxiang County, wrote to the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture, requesting the supply of fine breeds of piglets. Farmers in other places have also requested farms to help them solve the difficulty of lacking piglets. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　Encourage commune members to raise pigs and increase income
    The Xinguang Agricultural Cooperative in Nanling County, Anhui Province, actively encourages commune members to develop pig-raising as a sideline occupation, and has obtained an income of approximately 200,000 yuan this year, which has played a significant role in ensuring increased income for commune members and solving their difficulties.
    This year, the income of more than 90% of the commune members in this cooperative has increased, and the income of households that raise more pigs has increased by more than one time. The net income of commune member Mei Muzi increased by 500 yuan due to raising pigs.
    The Xinguang Agricultural Cooperative raises an average of more than one pig per household, and one sow for every six households. The cooperative has sold more than 3,000 fattened pigs to the state this year and has bred nearly 10,000 piglets, of which more than 7,500 have been sold to farmers outside the cooperative.
    The Xinguang Agricultural Cooperative has solved the difficulties and problems of pig raising in many ways. For example, it has set reasonable prices for pig manure, and in terms of feed, in addition to mobilizing commune members to collect wild grass, duckweed and other natural feeds, it has also arranged feed while arranging rations. For commune members who want to raise pigs but lack "pig capital," the agricultural cooperative will provide them with the piglets born from the publicly raised sows on credit. At the same time, it also mobilizes mutual assistance among commune members, with commune members who have more piglets providing them to commune members who have no pigs. Due to the above measures, the number of sows in this cooperative has increased by 25% this year compared to last year, and the number of fattened pigs has increased by 40%. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　May 1st Agricultural Cooperative: Almost every family raises pigs
    The "May 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing has raised more than 2,540 pigs this year, nearly double the number two years ago.
    Raising pigs has become a habit for commune members in this cooperative, and almost every family raises pigs. Commune member Wang Quanmao's family raises more than 20 pigs. Because he and his wife raise them properly, each pig grows plump and strong.
    This cooperative supports commune members in raising pigs in many ways. The cooperative has designated a purchaser to buy bran, soy sauce residue and other feeds for the commune members. To date, they have bought back more than 270,000 catties of feed. The cooperative's sweet potato seedlings and bean juice from the noodle factory are distributed to commune members free of charge or sold to commune members at low prices to mix with feed for pigs. The manure accumulated by commune members from raising pigs is converted into money at reasonable prices as the commune members' investment. This item alone is equivalent to commune members investing more than 37,000 yuan, which greatly stimulates the enthusiasm of commune members in raising pigs. (Xinhua News Agency)

    饲养更多更好的猪
　　龙游仔猪年产二十多万只
    以出产“龙游乌”良种仔猪出名的浙江省龙游县，现在饲养母猪一万一千只左右，比去年同期增加近一倍。全县平均不到五户农民就养一只母猪。这些母猪一年可以产仔猪二十多万只。
    最近三个多月来，江西省上饶专区、赣南行政区等地和浙江省嘉兴等二十多个县不断有人到龙游县来采购仔猪，农民已经销出的仔猪达三万只左右。　（新华社）
　  玉山母猪两年生五次小猪
    江西省著名仔猪产地玉山县，今年繁殖仔猪十三万只以上，比过去繁殖量最高的1952年还多70％。这些仔猪除满足当地农民需要以外，还有五万四千只可以供应给外地农民。其中有大部分已经供应出去。
    今年玉山县实现农业高级合作化以后，从多方面鼓励农民多养母猪，繁殖仔猪。据统计，全县今年共养母猪一万多只，比去年增加了40％。大部分母猪已经从过去一年繁殖两次提高到两年繁殖五次，因而大大增加了仔猪的产量。

    新方针，新办法
    江西省各专区、县的地方国营农场决定大力贯彻以繁殖和推广良种仔猪为主的方针，来代替过去饲养商品猪为主的方针。这是在11月18日江西省农业厅召开的全省地方国营农场养猪座谈会上，大家一致同意的。
    各地方国营农场将整理现有的种猪群，积极稳步地扩大种猪群，用科学的管理方法繁殖良种仔猪。根据现在各地方国营农场的种猪繁殖能力，一年内大约可以繁殖仔猪三万八千只。
    过去江西省各地方国营农场在发展养猪业中偏重于饲养肥猪，忽视了繁殖和推广良种仔猪。各地农业社普遍感到农场不能满足它们对良种仔猪的需要。萍乡县农业劳动模范易瑞生、彭光贤等曾经写信给江西省农业厅，要求供应良种仔猪。其他地方也有很多农民要求农场帮助他们解决缺少仔猪的困难。

　  鼓励社员养猪增加收入
    安徽省南陵县新光农业社积极鼓励社员发展养猪副业，今年已获得约二十万元的收入，这对保证增加社员收入、解决社员困难起了重大作用。
    今年这个社90％以上的社员收入都有了增加，养猪多的户收入有增加一倍多的。社员梅木子由于养猪而增加的纯收入达五百元。
    新光农业社平均每户养猪一只以上，而且每六户就养一头母猪。全社今年已卖给国家三千多只肥猪，并且繁殖了小猪近万只，其中有七千五百多只卖给了社外农民。
    新光农业社从多方面解决了养猪的困难和问题。例如，订出了合理的猪粪价格，在饲料方面，除发动社员采集野草、浮萍等自然饲料外，并在安排口粮的同时安排了饲料。对想养猪而又缺乏“猪本”的社员，农业社就把公养的母猪生的小猪赊给他们，同时，还发动社员之间互助，小猪多的社员赊给无猪的社员喂养。由于采取上述办法，这个社今年母猪比去年增加了25％，肥猪增加了40％。　（新华社）
　　五一农业社几乎家家养猪
    北京市郊区“五一”农业社今年养了两千五百四十多头猪，比两年前增加了近一倍。
    这个社里社员养猪已经成了习惯，几乎家家都养猪。社员王全茂
  一家就养了二十多头猪，由于他夫妇俩饲养得法，每头猪都长得膘肥体壮。
    这个社从多方面来支持社员养猪。社里指定一个采购员，专门代社员到各处去买粗糠、酱油渣等饲料。到目前止，他们买回的饲料已经有二十七万多斤。社里的甘薯秧和粉房出的豆汁水，都无偿地分给社员或者廉价地卖给社员拌饲料喂猪。社员养猪积的圈肥，社里都按合理价格折成钱，作为社员的投资。只这一项，社员就等于投资了三万七千多元，大大刺激了社员养猪的积极性。　（新华社）
