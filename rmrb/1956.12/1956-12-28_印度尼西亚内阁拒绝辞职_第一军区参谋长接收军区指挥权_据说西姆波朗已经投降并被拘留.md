Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 27th: The Indonesian Cabinet held a meeting for more than seven hours yesterday, listening to reports on the situations in North Sumatra and Central Sumatra, and discussing the withdrawal of Veterans Affairs Minister Dahlan Ibrahim from the cabinet. After the meeting, the cabinet issued a communique stating that the cabinet decided to explain the current domestic situation to the various government parties and expressed regret over the resignation of the Veterans Affairs Minister. In the future, the Ministry of Veterans Affairs will be managed by Second Deputy Prime Minister Idham Chalid.

The Indonesian Minister of Veterans Affairs resigned based on the decision of his political party, the Indonesian Independence Defenders Organization, because the party believed that "the current cabinet is not capable of implementing its program" and demanded the resignation of the current cabinet. However, the cabinet meeting did not agree with the opinions put forward by Ibrahim on behalf of the party.

According to the Indonesian News Agency, the Indonesian Independence Defenders Organization has requested the formation of a cabinet led by Hatta.

The news said that after the cabinet meeting, the Indonesian Minister of Information told reporters that, apart from the Indonesian Independence Defenders Organization, no other political party had raised the issue of returning the cabinet's mandate to the head of state during the discussion.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 27th: According to Antara News Agency, the Indonesian central government delegation that went to Padang, Central Sumatra on the 24th returned to Jakarta by plane on the evening of the 26th. They were unable to make contact with the "Wild Bull Division Committee".

Colonel Dalan Jambek, a member of the delegation, went to Medan from Padang on the order of the Army Chief of Staff.

Izhar, the Jakarta commissioner of the "Wild Bull Division Committee", who returned to Jakarta by plane last night with the delegation, told reporters that the central government-appointed delegation did not meet with the leaders of the "Wild Bull Division" because the "Wild Bull Division Committee" was only willing to negotiate with representatives appointed by the President himself.

Delayed news said that at a meeting of the "Wild Bull Division Committee" and government agencies throughout Central Sumatra on the 22nd, Lieutenant Colonel Husein's circular was read out, ordering all agencies to sever all forms of contact with the Indonesian central government.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 27th: This morning, Lieutenant Colonel Jamin Ginting, Chief of Staff of the Indonesian First Military Region, took over the leadership of the First Military Region from Colonel Simbolon in Medan, the capital of North Sumatra. There are reports that Simbolon has been detained.

Antara News Agency heard a statement from Lieutenant Colonel Jamin Ginting through the Medan Radio Station in Jakarta today. The statement announced that in order to comply with "Sapta Marga (Ten Principles of the Armed Forces)", the military oath, and President Sukarno's order issued on December 25th to restore normalcy in the First Military Region, "I believe it is necessary to take active measures quickly." Jamin Ginting said: "Therefore, at 6 o'clock today, December 27th, I took over the command of this region, and at this moment, relations with the central government will be restored."

The statement called on personnel of the local armed forces and the people to remain calm and trust that the leadership of the First Military Region will take wise steps to handle the situation.

Antara News Agency said that shortly before Jamin Ginting took over the command of the First Military Region, the army surrounded Simbolon's residence in Medan, and Simbolon then surrendered.

It is reported that the takeover operation was jointly carried out by Jamin Ginting and other senior officers of the First Military Region. Medan Radio Station is currently under the protection of armored vehicles.

The headquarters of the First Military Region is located in Medan, and its jurisdiction covers not only North Sumatra Province but also Central Sumatra Province.

    印度尼西亚内阁拒绝辞职
    第一军区参谋长接收军区指挥权
    据说西姆波朗已经投降并被拘留
    据新华社雅加达27日电　印度尼西亚内阁昨天举行了七个多小时的会议，听取了有关北苏门答腊和中苏门答腊的情况的报告，并且讨论了退伍军人事务部部长达赫兰·易卜拉欣退出内阁的问题。内阁在会后发表公报说，内阁决定就目前国内情势向各政府党提出解释，并对退伍军人事务部部长引退这件事表示遗憾，今后退伍军人事务部由第二副总理伊德汉·查利德掌管。
    印度尼西亚退伍军人事务部部长是根据他所属的政党印度尼西亚独立保卫者组织的决定而引退的，因为这个党认为“现内阁没有能力去实施它的政纲”，要求现内阁辞职，但内阁会议并没有同意易卜拉欣代表这个党所提出的意见。
    据印度尼西亚新闻社消息，印度尼西亚独立保卫者组织要求组成一个由哈达领导的内阁。
    消息说，印度尼西亚情报部部长在内阁会议后对记者说，在讨论中除印度尼西亚独立保卫者组织外，还没有其他政党提出关于把内阁委任状交回给国家元首的问题。
    据新华社雅加达27日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，24日到中苏门答腊的巴东去的印度尼西亚中央政府代表团26日晚上已经搭乘飞机回到雅加达。他们没有能够和“雄牛师委员会”进行接触。
    代表团中的一个团员达兰·贾姆贝克上校奉陆军参谋长的命令，从巴东到棉兰去了。
    昨晚同代表团一起搭飞机回到雅加达的“雄牛师委员会”驻雅加达专员伊兹哈尔对记者说，因为“雄牛师委员会”只愿意同总统自己任命的代表谈判，所以这个由中央政府任命的代表团没有见到“雄牛师”的领导人。
    迟到的消息说，在22日“雄牛师委员会”和全中苏门答腊的政府机关举行的一次会议上，曾宣读了侯赛尼中校的通令，命令各机关断绝同印度尼西亚中央政府的任何形式的联系。
    据新华社雅加达27日电　印度尼西亚第一军区参谋长贾明·京廷中校今天上午在北苏门答腊首府棉兰从西姆波朗上校手中接收了第一军区的领导权。有消息说，西姆波朗已经被拘留。
    安塔拉通讯社今天在雅加达收听到贾明·京廷中校通过棉兰电台发表的一篇声明，声明宣布，为了遵守“斯普他马加（武装部队的十项原则）”、军人誓词以及苏加诺总统在12月25日发出的要第一军区恢复正常情况的命令，“我认为有必要迅速采取积极的行动”。贾明·京廷说：“因此，在今天12月27日6点钟，我接收了本区的指挥权，此刻，同中央政府之间的关系将恢复。”
    声明号召当地武装部队的人员和人民保持镇静，并且信任第一军区的领导方面将会采取明智的步骤来处理局势。
    安塔拉通讯社说，在贾明·京廷接收第一军区指挥权之前不久，军队包围了西姆波朗在棉兰的住宅，西姆波朗于是投降。
    据报道，接收行动是由贾明·京廷同第一军区的其他高级军官共同进行的。棉兰电台目前正在装甲车保护之下。
    第一军区的总部设在棉兰，它所管辖的范围除了北苏门答腊省以外，还包括中苏门答腊省。
