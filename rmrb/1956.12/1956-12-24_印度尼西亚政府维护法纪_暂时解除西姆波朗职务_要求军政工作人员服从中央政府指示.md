Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 23rd: The Indonesian Cabinet, at a special meeting held on the afternoon of December 22nd, decided to temporarily relieve Colonel Simbolon, commander of the First Military Region, of his duties, effective December 22nd.

The Cabinet also decided that Army Chief of Staff Nasution would directly command the First Infantry Regiment currently stationed in Aceh and the Fourth Infantry Regiment stationed in Central Sumatra.

In a broadcast on Medan Radio at 8:00 AM on December 22nd, Simbolon announced the takeover of the North Sumatra provincial government and stated that he did not recognize the current cabinet.

A cabinet decision, announced by Minister of Information Sudibjo, required personnel of national military and government organs to respect their oaths of service to the country and obey the instructions of the central government. The cabinet decision stated that in a democratic country like Indonesia, only the parliament has the right to decide whether the government has erred in implementing its program. The possible shortcomings or errors of the government should not be an excuse for anyone to take illegal steps. From this point of view, it is clear that Colonel Simbolon has trampled on the laws of the Indonesian nation.

The government called on the people of North Sumatra to uphold justice and democratic principles. The government expressed its belief that all Indonesian people, especially the people of North Sumatra, would cooperate with the government to strive to solve the current domestic problems.

The chiefs of staff of the Air Force, Navy, and Army, as well as other senior officials, attended this special cabinet meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 22nd: Some Indonesian newspapers today accused the Banteng Division veterans of launching a misguided local coup in Central Sumatra province.

"Merdeka" newspaper said that the Banteng Division Executive Committee's action of "taking over" the Central Sumatra provincial government was illegal and wrong and must be opposed. The newspaper hoped that the government would act decisively and prevent other places from imitating this action.

"Harian Rakjat" believes that the Masyumi Party and the Socialist Party are behind this local coup, and Central Sumatra Governor Mulyohardjo should be held responsible for this incident. The newspaper also pointed out that Mulyohardjo and Hussein both spoke about the need to form another cabinet at the "takeover" ceremony.

    印度尼西亚政府维护法纪
    暂时解除西姆波朗职务
    要求军政工作人员服从中央政府指示
    新华社雅加达23日电　印度尼西亚内阁在12月22日下午举行的特别会议上，决定从12月22日起暂时解除第一军区司令西姆波朗上校的职务。
    内阁还决定暂时由陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安直接指挥现在驻在亚齐的第一步兵团和驻在中苏门答腊的第四步兵团。
    西姆波朗在12月22日早上八时在棉兰电台广播的公告中，宣布接管北苏门答腊省政权，并且表示不承认现内阁。
    由政府情报部长苏迪比约发表的内阁决定，要求国家军政机关的工作人员尊重他们所作的为国效劳的誓言，服从中央政府的指示。内阁决定说，在像印度尼西亚这样的民主国家中，只有国会有权决定政府是否在执行它的政纲方面犯了错误。政府可能有的缺点或错误不应该成为任何人采取违法步骤的借口。从这个观点来看，显然，西姆波朗上校蹂躏了印度尼西亚国家的法律。
    政府要求北苏门答腊的人民维护正义和民主原则。政府表示相信，全体印度尼西亚人民，特别是北苏门答腊人民，是会同政府合作来努力解决目前的国内问题的。
    空军、海军和陆军参谋长以及其他高级官员参加了这次内阁特别会议。
    据新华社雅加达22日电　今天的一些印度尼西亚报纸指责雄牛师退伍军官在中苏门答腊省发动的地方性政变是一种错误的行动。
    “独立报”说，雄牛师执行委员会“接管”中苏门答腊省政权的行动是违法的和错误的，必须加以反对。这家报纸希望政府当机立断，不要使其他地方效法这种行动。
    “人民日报”认为，马斯友美党和社会党站在这个地方政变的背后，中苏门答腊省长穆尔约哈约应该对这个事件负责。报纸还指出，穆尔约哈约和胡辛在“接管”政权的仪式上都讲到要求另外组织内阁的事。
