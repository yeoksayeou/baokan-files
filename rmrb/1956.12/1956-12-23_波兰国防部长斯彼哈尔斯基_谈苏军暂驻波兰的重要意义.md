Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 21st. Polish Press Agency reported on the 20th: Polish Defense Minister General Spychalski gave an interview to a Polish Press Agency reporter, discussing the important significance of the Polish-Soviet treaty signed in Warsaw on December 17th concerning the legal status of Soviet troops temporarily stationed in Poland.

Spychalski said that this treaty, signed at our initiative and with the full understanding of the Soviet side, is a consistent expression of consistency between words and deeds in Polish-Soviet relations. This proves that the issue of equality between our two countries is moving from the realm of statements to concrete actions. This will certainly have an impact on fostering genuine friendship, goodwill, and friendly feelings among our people towards our great neighbor.

Spychalski said that the treaty signed on December 17th politically strengthened our country and is an important factor in the process of consolidating the unity of socialist countries based on the new principles put forward in the Soviet government's declaration of October 30th this year. The importance of these facts goes far beyond the scope of relations between socialist countries. This treaty is also an example of how relations between large and small countries should generally be arranged.

Spychalski emphasized that there are still forces that are unwilling to see the major international issues resolved in a spirit of harmony based on the interests of all countries. Twelve years after the war, a peace treaty with Germany has not yet been concluded, and some are still attempting to cast doubt on our rights to our western territories, attempting to cast doubt on our Oder-Neisse border. The temporary stationing of Soviet troops in Poland is the result of this situation. It is urgently needed for both our countries, as the threat from West German revisionists and militarists still exists for both Poland and the Soviet Union.

Spychalski then emphasized that the talks before the signing of the treaty were filled with a truly friendly atmosphere. The Soviet side treated our demands with sympathy, and met these demands with a full understanding of our needs and interests. During the talks, one could clearly feel that our friends were not only considering the interests of their own country, but also showing their understanding of the interests of all socialist countries and the interests of peace in Europe.

    波兰国防部长斯彼哈尔斯基
    谈苏军暂驻波兰的重要意义
    新华社华沙21日电　据波兰通讯社20日报道：波兰国防部长斯彼哈尔斯基将军向波兰通讯社记者发表谈话，论述12月17日在华沙签订的波苏两国关于暂时驻在波兰的苏联军队的法律地位条约的重要意义。
    斯彼哈尔斯基说，根据我们的创议并且得到苏联方面充分谅解而签订的这个条约，是在波苏关系中言行一致的一贯的表现。这证明我们两国之间平等的问题正在从声明的范围进入具体行动。这对于促成我国人民对我们伟大的邻邦产生真正的友谊、善意的友好的情绪当然不会不发生影响。
    斯彼哈尔斯基说，12月17日签订的条约在政治上加强了我们的国家，并且是根据苏联政府今年10月30日宣言中提出的新的原则来巩固社会主义国家的团结的过程中的一个重要因素。这些事实的重要性远远超出了社会主义国家之间关系的范围。这个条约同时还是一般地应该怎样来安排大国和小国之间关系的一个范例。
    斯彼哈尔斯基强调说，目前还有着不愿意看到根据所有国家的利益以和洽的精神来解决主要国际问题的势力。在战后十二年的今天，还没有缔结对德和约，有人还在企图使人怀疑我们对西部领土的权利，企图使人怀疑我们在奥得—尼斯河的边界。苏联军队暂时驻扎在波兰正是这种局势的结果。对于我国和苏联仍然存在着来自西德的边界修订主义者和军国主义者的威胁，这样做对我们两国都是迫切需要的。
    斯彼哈尔斯基随后着重指出：在签订条约之前举行的会谈充满了真正友好的气氛。苏联方面同情地对待我们的要求，以充分了解我们的需要和利益的心情来满足这些要求。在会谈中，人们能够明显地体会到我们的朋友们不仅仅考虑到他们国家的利益，而且表现出他们了解到所有社会主义国家的利益、欧洲和平的利益。
