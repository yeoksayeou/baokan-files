    Chengzili Agricultural Cooperative Has Over One Mu of Mulberry Field
    Per Mu Yield of Mulberry Leaves Exceeds 6,200 Jin
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 13th: Recent investigations by agricultural departments in Shunde County, Guangdong Province, have confirmed that the Chengzili Agricultural Production Cooperative in the county has over one mu and four fen of mulberry field with an average yield of 6,270 jin of mulberry leaves per mu.
    This high-yield mulberry field is managed by Li Yunzhen, who is experienced in mulberry cultivation. When he was working individually last year, the average yield of this mulberry field was 6,113 jin of mulberry leaves per mu. Therefore, he was awarded at the Guangdong Provincial Representative Conference of Agricultural Labor Models.
    According to preliminary understanding, Li Yunzhen's main mulberry cultivation experience is: Planting approximately 7,000 mulberry trees per mu, which is more than the usual 2,000 trees. He pays attention to land preparation and applying base fertilizer in winter, and top-dresses with liquid manure and pond mud after each leaf harvest in the coming year, and diligently removes weeds. He harvests leaves very carefully, without damaging the branches, and also pays attention to appropriately selecting and retaining good branches. He also promptly carries out pest control.
    This year, the total mulberry field area of the Chengzili Agricultural Cooperative is 97 mu, with an average yield of over 3,300 jin per mu.
    Guangdong Province is a high-yield area for mulberry leaves in China, with generally more than 4,000 mulberry trees planted per mu, and leaves are harvested six or seven times a year. This year, the harvested area of mulberry fields in the province is more than 140,000 mu, with a preliminary estimate of an average yield of 2,478 jin per mu.

    城梓里农业社有一亩多桑地
    亩产桑叶六千二百多斤
    新华社广州13日电　广东省顺德县农业部门最近调查证实，这个县的城梓里农业生产合作社有一亩四分多桑地平均每亩产桑叶六千二百七十斤。
    这块高产桑地是由富有种桑经验的黎芸珍负责经营的。去年他单干的时候，这块桑地平均每亩产桑叶六千一百一十三斤。因此，在广东省农业劳动模范代表会议上他受到了奖励。
    据初步了解，黎芸珍的种桑经验主要是：栽植桑树每亩约有七千株，比一般多二千多株。冬季就注意整地和施基肥，来年每次采叶后都追施水粪和塘泥，并且勤除杂草。采叶很细心，不损伤枝条，还注意适当选留好的枝条。及时做好除虫工作。
    今年城梓里农业社全部桑地九十七亩，平均每亩产量是三千三百多斤。
    广东省是我国桑叶的高产地区，一般每亩栽植桑树四千多株，一年采叶六、七次。今年全省桑地收获面积十四万多亩，初步预计平均每亩产二千四百七十八斤。
