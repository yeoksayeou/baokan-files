    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 17th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru arrived in Washington by plane on the 16th for a four-day visit.
    Nehru and his daughter, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, were welcomed at Washington National Airport by senior American government officials headed by US Vice President Nixon and Secretary of State Dulles. After leaving National Airport, Nehru, accompanied by Nixon and others, went to the White House for lunch with Eisenhower and held an hour-long meeting with Dulles that afternoon.
    According to a White House spokesman, the meeting between Nehru and Eisenhower will be completely secret.

    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 17th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru said at a reception held at the Indian Embassy on the 16th: "Countries must agree to non-interference, maintain friendship, give friendship, and coexist without aggression." He believes that this is the principle that must be accepted to avoid conflict.
    Nehru stated that India acts with the above-mentioned attitude. It does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and hopes to "make and keep friends," maintaining friendship even when "opinions differ." At the same time, it hopes to serve as a bridge between East and West.
    He said: "With so much fear, suspicion, and violence in the world, it is beneficial to build a bridge. That is why we have been playing such a role in the world from the United Nations side."
    He denied that India is "neutral." He said: "People say our foreign policy is one of sitting on the fence, but the fact is that we act independently." He also said: "American newspapers often say that I want to become the leader of Asia. However, we do not want to be a leader, nor do we want to be led by anyone else."
    Nehru said that Eisenhower showed great interest in India's newly launched Second Five-Year Plan.

    尼赫鲁到达华盛顿后发表谈话
    要求各国同意和平共处原则
    印度希望充当东西方之间的桥梁
    新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：印度总理尼赫鲁16日乘飞机到达华盛顿作为期四天的访问。
    尼赫鲁和他的女儿英迪拉·甘地夫人在华盛顿国民机场上受到以美国副总统尼克松、国务卿杜勒斯为首的美国政府高级官员的欢迎。离开国民机场后，尼赫鲁即由尼克松等陪同前往白宫同艾森豪威尔共进午餐，并且在当天下午同杜勒斯举行了一小时的会谈。
    据白宫发言人说，这次尼赫鲁同艾森豪威尔举行的会谈将是完全秘密的。
    新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：印度总理尼赫鲁16日在印度大使馆举行的招待会上说：“各国必须同意互不干涉，保持友谊，给予友谊，并且在没有侵略的情况下共处。”他认为，这是要避免冲突就必须接受的原则。
    尼赫鲁表示，印度就是抱上述这种态度行事的。它不干涉他国内政，希望“结交和保持朋友”，即使在彼此“意见不一致的时候”也保持友谊。同时，它希望充当东西方之间的桥梁。
    他说：“世界上有那么多的恐惧、猜忌和暴力行为，架设一座桥梁是有益的。这就是从联合国方面讲我们一直在世界上起这样一个作用的缘故。”
    他否认印度是“中立的”。他说：“人们说我们的外交政策是骑墙政策，但是事实是我们是独立地行事的。”他还说：“美国报纸上常常说我想成为亚洲的领袖。但是，我们并不希望成为一个领袖，我们也不希望受其他任何人的领导。”
    尼赫鲁说，艾森豪威尔对印度刚着手进行的第二个五年计划表现了很大的兴趣。
