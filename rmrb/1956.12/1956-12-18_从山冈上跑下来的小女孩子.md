    The Little Girl Running Down the Hill
    Chen Bochui
    It was already late when I returned from the seaside bathing beach. The beautiful scenery of the sea was truly captivating. In order to make it in time for dinner, I had to quicken my pace.

    I climbed up the slope step by step from the foot of the hill. Looking up, I saw the red rooftops of the sanatorium on the hilltop bathed in the afterglow of the setting sun, while a row of westward-facing glass windows on the small building gleamed with silver light.

    As I approached the bend in the mountain path, I saw a little girl running down the hill. She was carrying a grass basket almost as big as herself, with weeds sticking out from the top, unruly and scattered, obscuring her little face. I was focused on catching up with time and hurried past her.

    "Uncle, are you rushing to the sanatorium for dinner?"

    I was taken aback by this sudden, crisp, and childish voice, and stopped to look back. Behind me stood a little girl of about eight or nine years old. She had put down the grass basket and was staring at me with big eyes, smiling with a row of small white teeth. She looked very likable. She seemed sturdy and, despite her young age, quite experienced.

    I was drawn to her and couldn't help but strike up a conversation. "How did you know?"

    She blinked her big eyes, happy as if she had guessed a riddle. "Well, I knew it. I saw you running out of the sanatorium the day before yesterday morning."

    I secretly admired her; I didn't expect such a young girl to be so observant. I grew fond of her and asked casually, "But where did you see me? I didn't see you."

    "Well, I was cutting grass in the woods behind the building you're staying in. Yesterday morning, I even saw you standing on the balcony looking at Taiping Cape."

    I laughed. "You have good eyesight."

    Her black gemstone-like eyes sparkled under her eyelashes; two shallow dimples appeared on her cheeks, reddened and purplish from the summer sun.

    I praised her again, "Did your mom tell you to cut so much grass? To feed the sheep?"

    "No, no one told me to. I wanted to cut it myself. To feed the cooperative's sheep."

    My heart stirred. "This is voluntary labor!" I blurted out, "You're such a good kid!"

    "It's not either. The teacher said we should love labor."

    "Then you do a good job, the teacher must like you."

    She tilted her head, looking a little shy. Suddenly, she raised her head and said seriously, "Uncle, look, I don't have one yet."

    At first, I didn't understand, but then I realized. "You, you'll wear a red scarf soon."

    She smiled, but didn't answer.

    "How old are you? Not yet nine?" I thought I should comfort and encourage her.

    She nodded, thought for a moment, "Two months and seventeen days short." Afraid I wouldn't understand, she innocently held up her fingers to count for me.

    "Where is your home?"

    "You see, at the foot of that hill to the west. Two *li* away."

    "Can you manage carrying this big basket so far?"

    "I can. It's still one *li* from home to the cooperative." Her small voice revealed a heroic spirit.

    Suddenly, the bell on the hilltop rang loudly. This clever little girl was very sensitive and rushed to say, "Uncle, hurry, the bell in the canteen is ringing, dinner is starting."

    "Then, let me help you carry the basket."

    "Uncle, no need." She quickly and deftly hoisted it onto her back herself. "Uncle, see you tomorrow!"

    "See you tomorrow!" But I couldn't walk any faster, looking back with every step, as if I had lost something behind me.

    I enjoyed this dinner very much because I was happy, and I even ate two extra steamed buns. As I ate, I kept thinking about this lovely little girl. I also thought about how, on the land of our motherland's peaceful construction, millions of healthy, lively, brave, and honest new generations are growing up. I am joyful, I am proud, and I picked up another steamed bun.

    从山冈上跑下来的小女孩子
    陈伯吹
    从海滨浴场回来不觉已经迟了。海的美丽风光真叫人留恋。为了赶上开饭的时间，脚步不得不紧些。
    在山冈下面一步步迈上坡。猛抬头，望见冈顶上疗养所的红屋顶正沉浸在斜阳的返照中，而小楼上向西的一排玻璃窗却耀出一片银光来。
    快走到山径拐弯的地方，迎面看见一个从山冈上跑下来的小女孩子。她驮着几乎比她个儿还大的草篓子，杂草在篓子口探头伸手撒野似的，蓬蓬松松、零零落落地挂下来，因此她的小脸儿给遮得看不清楚了。我一心在追赶时间，急匆匆地从她身旁边跑过去。
    “叔叔，您赶着上疗养所吃晚饭吗？”
    我给这个突如其来的清脆而又带着稚气的声音愣住了，停步回头一看，身后边正站着一个八、九岁光景的小女孩子。她已经把草篓子放了下来，睁着一双大眼睛盯着我，还露出一排细白的牙齿咧着嘴笑。模样儿很讨人喜欢。看起来，她长得结实，虽然年纪小，却老练。
    我被她吸引住了，禁不住和她攀谈起来。“你，怎么会知道的呢？”
    她眨了眨大眼睛，好像猜中了一个谜语般地快乐。“嗯，我知道的。前天早上，我就看见您从疗养所里跑出来。”
    我暗暗佩服她，想不到这样小的女孩子，竟能够这样地留心人。我爱起她来，搭讪着：“可是你在哪儿见到我的，怎么我没见到你呢？”
    “喏，我就在您住的房子后面的林子里割草。昨天早上，我还看见您站在阳台上望太平岬。”
    我笑出来了：“你的眼力真好。”
    她霎着黑宝石般的眼珠，在睫毛下面射出光彩来；给夏天的太阳晒得红里发紫的颊上，露出两个浅浅的笑涡儿。
    我又称赞她：“是你妈叫你割这么多的草！喂羊？”
    “不是的，没人叫我。我自己要割的。喂社里的羊。”
    我的心一动，“这是义务劳动啊！”不觉随口说出来：“你真是一个好孩子！”
    “也不是的。老师说要爱劳动。”
    “那你干活干得挺好，老师一定喜欢。”
    她歪着脖子，头偏着低下去，有点儿害臊的样子。忽然她抬起头来，一本正经地说：“叔叔，你看，我还没呢。”
    起初我没听懂，后来我会意了。“你，就会戴上红领巾的。”
    她笑了笑，没回答。
    “你多大？还没满九岁吗？”我想到该安慰她，鼓励她。
    她点点头，想了想，“差两个月十七天。”还怕我弄不清楚，天真地伸出手指头数给我看。
    “你家呢？”
    “您瞧，西边那个山冈脚下就是。二里地。”
    “你驮着这个大篓子走那么远能行吗？”
    “我行。家到社还有一里地。”小声音里吐露出英雄气概。
    突然地冈顶上当当地响起来。这个机灵的小女孩子非常敏感，抢着说：“叔叔，您快走，食堂里的钟响了，开饭啦。”
    “那么，我帮你驮上篓子。”
    “叔叔，甭了。”她快手快脚地又抢着自己驮上了。“叔叔，明天见！”
    “明天见！”可是我再也走不快了，一步一回头，仿佛在后面丢了什么似的。
    这顿晚饭我吃得特别香，因为心里高兴，竟多吃了两个花卷儿。我一边吃，一边老想念着这个可爱的小女孩子。我又想到在祖国和平建设的土地上，几千百万的健壮活拨、勇敢诚实的新一代在成长起来。我喜悦，我骄傲，我又拿起一个花卷儿来。
