Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 23rd: The Indian Writers' Conference opened at the Vigyan Bhavan in New Delhi on the morning of the 22nd.

    The Chairman of the Conference, Indian Member of Parliament Humayun Kabir, said in his speech that the Asian Writers' Conference is a welcome step to strengthen mutual understanding and cultural exchange in the literary field. More than 350 male and female writers, poets, novelists, playwrights, and scholars are attending the conference. They hold different political views and represent all fourteen major languages ​​of India.

    Kabir traced the development of Sanskrit, Persian, and English in India and their influence on Indian literature. He called on Indian writers to write in their own languages. He said: "A nation's imaginative literature can only be created through its own language."

    Kabir pointed out that due to more than two centuries of Western rule, we were unable to access Eastern culture. It was Tagore who later restored ancient cultural ties. Therefore, he welcomed the convening of the Asian Writers' Conference.

    The famous Gujarati writer and social worker Kaka Kalelkar said in his opening speech: The task of bringing Asian writers together and uniting Indian writers is a sacred task and should have been carried out long ago after India gained independence.

    He said that India's culture is very rich and has been a confluence of several cultures since ancient times. The influence of Aryan, Mughal, Christian, and Chinese cultures on Indian culture is very obvious. Similarly, Indian culture has also influenced the cultures of many neighboring countries for many centuries. Today, the people of Asia have awakened after a long sleep and are studying their rich heritage. Therefore, convening the Asian Writers' Conference is timely and appropriate.

    The famous Bengali novelist Banerjee also spoke at the meeting.

    That afternoon, the Indian Writers' Conference held a meeting based on some questions raised by the representatives to discuss the selection of Indian representatives to attend the Asian Writers' Conference. These representatives requested the conference to finally approve the list of Indian representatives.

    迎接亚洲作家会议
    印度作家大会前日开幕
    新华社新德里23日电　印度作家大会22日上午在新德里科学宫开幕。
    大会主席、印度国会议员胡马云·卡比尔致词说，亚洲作家会议是加强文学领域内的互相了解和文化交流的一个值得欢迎的步骤。出席大会的有三百五十多位男女作家、诗人、小说家、剧作家和学者。他们具有不同的政治见解，并且代表了印度所有的十四种主要语言。
    卡比尔追述了梵语、波斯语和英语在印度的发展过程以及它们对印度文学的影响。他号召印度作家们用他们自己的语言来写作。他说：“一个民族的富有想像力的文学只能通过本民族自己的语言才能创作出来。”
    卡比尔指出，由于两世纪多的西方统治，我们无法接触到东方文化。后来恢复古老的文化联系的是泰戈尔。他因此表示欢迎召开亚洲作家会议。
    著名的古吉拉特文作家和社会工作者卡卡·卡勒尔卡在致开幕词的时候说：使亚洲作家共聚一堂和团结印度作家的任务是一个神圣的任务，而且是在印度获得独立以后早就应该进行的了。
    他说，印度的文化是非常丰富的，并且从古代以来就是几种文化的汇合。雅利安文化、莫卧儿文化、基督教文化和中国文化对印度文化的影响是十分明显的。同样，印度的文化许多世纪以来也一直影响着许多邻国的文化。今天，亚洲人民在长期沉睡以后已经觉醒了，他们正在研究他们过去的丰富遗产。因此，召开亚洲作家会议是及时的，也是适当的。
    著名的孟加拉文小说家班纳吉也在会上发了言。
    当天下午，印度作家大会根据代表们提出的一些问题开会讨论印度出席亚洲作家会议的代表人选问题。这些代表要求大会最后通过印度代表的名单。
