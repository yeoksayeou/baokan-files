“Too Much” and “Dragging”
　　Ma Qianzu
　　If you ask me: What are the characteristics of various organs in our country? I can immediately tell you, there are two major characteristics: one is "too much," and the other is "dragging."

　　Saying "too much" means: too many heads, too many layers, too many people.

　　Saying "dragging" means: dragging today, dragging tomorrow, and still dragging the day after tomorrow.

　　It is said that the work is busy, and it is difficult to manage with few people, so there must be many people. As long as you walk into an office, when you ask about the number of people, it is not in the hundreds but in the thousands. When you ask about the responsible comrades, there are principal positions, deputy positions, and assistant positions. These are naturally all leaders, all bosses. In addition, there are also directors and deputy directors of the general office or office, and the deputy directors are by no means just one; they must always be counted in the group of leaders. In this way, isn't the number of heads too much?

　　When asked about the layers, needless to say, under a ministry, there are always departments and bureaus. Between the ministry and the departments and bureaus, there is also a general office. Under the departments and bureaus, there are always sections. Between the departments and bureaus and the sections, some ministries also have offices. If there are no offices, then there are no office directors, but below a principal department/bureau director and several deputy department/bureau directors, and above a principal section chief and several deputy section chiefs, some ministries also have commissioners. The commissioners also have principals and deputies, which is very symmetrical. The lowest level, needless to say, is the staff members and clerks.

　　It seems that not enough heads is not enough to speak of collective leadership. Not enough layers is not enough to speak of the grandeur of the organs. Not enough official titles is not enough to improve the enthusiasm of cadres.

　　However, work cannot but be dragged.

　　Generally, for an incoming official matter, it always goes from the general receiving and dispatching office to the general office (if there is a secretariat under the general office, naturally the secretariat handles it before sending it to the director of the general office), from the general office to the department/bureau, from the department/bureau to the section, but it may also be distributed to the commissioner; the section assigns it to the staff member or clerk to handle—drafting or doing something. Then, it is reported and sent up level by level for approval, until the minister signs it, and this "journey" is over. And the ministry, general office, department, and bureau, as usual, all have secretaries. If this official matter is delayed in the hands of the secretaries of the ministry, general office, department, and bureau, then completing it in ten days or eight days is fast, completing it in one or two months is good, and completing it in three or four months is not bad.

　　But this is, after all, an external official matter, with tasks that must be rushed. If it is a small cadre or a small unit submitting a "report" for approval, or putting forward a "suggestion" for handling, it is a matter within the gate, whether to pay attention to it or not is up to "me". The most considerate way is to write the names of the principal and deputy positions on the corner of the "submission" or "suggestion," and circulate it around as usual. Some, although "circulated" to, have not been "read," closing their eyes and drawing a red circle, blue circle, or even a black circle on their name, and feeling at ease, anyway, there are many people circulating it, and someone will be itchy and diligent, writing a few sentences on the blank space. Or no one will even write a comment, and the secretary will file it away, "sinking into the sea."

　　How can one expect work not to be "dragged" in this way?

　　Therefore, it is said: "Dragging" comes from "too much."

　　But why not everyone lower their positions to match, reduce the levels and try it out. Those with the talent of a deputy minister or assistant minister, going to be a department/bureau director, wouldn't they be more competent and able to stand alone? Using the ministry and the department/bureau to form a leading collective, wouldn't that be more "eyes watching in all directions, ears listening to all sides"? Those with the talent of an office director or commissioner becoming a section chief or deputy section chief, those with the talent of a section chief or deputy section chief becoming a staff member or clerk, wouldn't everyone be effective and competent? In this way, with fewer heads, fewer levels, and fewer people, the work would not be dragged today, dragged tomorrow, and still dragged the day after tomorrow.

　　If it is said that China's situation is special, and it is necessary to take care of both the united front and the old cadres, and to cultivate young people and new cadres, then I think work itself does not allow for such care, and cultivation can be done outside the organs. Otherwise, one will inevitably end up with both "too much" and "dragging."

### “多”和“拖”

    “多”和“拖”
  　马前卒
    你如果问我：咱们国家里各种机关有什么特色？我马上可以告诉你，有两大特色：一个是“多”，另一个是“拖”。
    说“多”是：头多，层次多，人手多。
    说“拖”是：今天拖，明天拖，后天还是拖。
    据说是工作忙，人少难打理，必须人手多。你只要走进一个机关，问人数，不是论百，就是上千。问负责同志，有正职、副职，还有助理职。这些自然都是首长，都是头子。另外还要加上办公厅或办公室的主任，副主任，副主任又决不止一个，总也得算在首长之群里。如此看来，其为头也不亦多乎？
    问层次，不用说，一个部之下，总是司、局。部与司、局之间，还有办公厅。司、局之下，总是科。司、局与科之间，有的部则还有处。没处的，再也没有处长了，但是一个正司、局长几个副司、局长之下，和一个正科长、几个副科长之上，有的部还有专员。专员也有正有副，非常对称。最下层，不用说，那是科员和办事员了。
    看来，头不多不足以言集体领导。层次不多不足以言机关气派。官衔不多不足以提高干部积极性。
    然而工作也就不能不拖了。
    大抵有一件外来公事，总是从总收发到办公厅（如果办公厅之下还有秘书处，自然秘书处承理后再送办公厅主任），由办公厅到司、局，由司、局分发到科，但也有分发到专员的；由科批交科员或办事员办理——拟稿或作什么。然后，再一级级向上报，向上送批，直到部长签字，这才完了“旅行”。而部、厅、司、局，照例都还有秘书。如果这个公事再在部、厅、司、局的秘书的手里耽搁一下，那么，十天八天办完是快的，一月两月办完算好的，三月四月办完不算坏了。
    但这终久是外来的公事，有任务、不能不赶。如果是小干部、小单位上个“签呈”请批，提个“建议”请办，那是大门以内的事，要理不理，悉听“我”便。最体下情的办法，就在“呈文”“建议书”的角上，写下正职、副职的名字，照例团团转地传阅一番。有的虽然“传”到，却并未“阅”过，闭着眼睛在自己名字上画上个红圈、蓝圈以至黑圈，也就心安理得了，反正传阅人多，总有人会手痒笔勤，在空白上写下几句。或者竟无一人批写，秘书拿来也就立卷归档，“石沉大海”了。
    如此而欲工作不“拖”者，其可得乎？
    故口：“拖”出于“多”。
    但为什么不大家降职相就，减少层次试试看。有副部长，部长助理之才者，去当司、局长，岂不更能胜任愉快，独当一面？以部与司、局而构成领导集体，岂不更加“眼关四方，耳听八面”？有处长和专员之才者而当科长或副科长，有科长和副科长之才者而当科员或办事员，岂不人人得力，个个称职。如此，头少、层次少，人手少，而工作也不至今天拖，明天拖，后天还是拖了。
    如果说，中国情况特殊，既要照顾统战和老干部，又要培养青年和新干部。则我以为工作本身不允许照顾，机关以外尽可培养。否则，终不免于既“多”又“拖”的。
