Xinhua News Agency, 21st - The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives convened a symposium in mid-December with the livestock product procurement departments of eight provinces, including Hebei, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Sichuan, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang, to discuss the promotion of superior rabbit breeds.

The meeting pointed out that the Angora wool rabbit and the Rex rabbit, both superior breeds, are experiencing a shortage of supply due to the simple equipment requirements, ease of raising, cheap feed, low cost, rapid reproduction, high prices for rabbit breeds and fur, and a ready market for rabbit meat. However, issues such as impure rabbit breeds, crossbreeding, poor feeding methods, and price confusion are seriously affecting the progress of this work. The meeting believed that, to obtain a high-quality and plentiful supply of fine rabbit wool and fur, livestock product procurement departments should cooperate with agricultural departments in 1957, following the principles of guiding production, developing consolidation, and emphasizing quality, to actively promote the raising of superior rabbit breeds among agricultural cooperatives and farmers, and to help agricultural cooperatives and farms with an existing foundation to improve the quality of rabbit breeds.

The meeting suggested that various localities select agricultural cooperatives and state-owned farms with suitable conditions to establish rabbit breeding stations, and cultivate superior breeds through bloodline exchange, inter-regional exchange of fine breeds, and sharing of breeding experience.

    全国供销合作总社召开座谈会
    研究优良兔种推广工作
    新华社21日讯　中华全国供销合作总社12月中旬召开了河北、陕西、江苏、浙江、山东、四川、辽宁、黑龙江等八省畜产采购部门举行优良兔种推广座谈会。
    会议指出，优良种兔安哥拉毛兔，力克斯皮兔由于养兔设备条件简单、饲养容易、饲料便宜、成本低、繁殖快、兔种及毛皮价贵、兔肉也有销路，群众大量饲养，到处出现兔种供应不足的现象。但是目前由于兔种不纯、变种杂交、饲养方法不善、价格混乱等原因，严重地影响了这项工作的开展。会议认为，为了获得质好量多的优良兔毛兔皮货源，1957年畜产采购部门应配合农业部门按照指导生产、发展巩固、质量并重等方针，积极向农业社和农民群众推广优良种兔的饲养工作，并且帮助已有饲养基础的农业社和农业饲养场，以提高兔种质量。
    会议建议各地选择有条件的农业社和国营农场，建立养兔配种站，通过血统调换、地区之间良种交换、交流饲养经验等办法培养良种。
