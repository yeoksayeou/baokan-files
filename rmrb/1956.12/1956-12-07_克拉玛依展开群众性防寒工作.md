　　Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, December 6th: Recently, in the Karamay, Ulkho and other petroleum exploration areas, 181 workers and 15 units have been rewarded by relevant departments for their outstanding achievements in winter cold-weather protection preparation.
    Since September, the Karamay mining area has fully launched mass cold-weather protection work. The workers overcame the difficulties of insufficient building materials, vehicles and tools, and built cellars on the Gobi Desert for winter accommodation, storage of materials, and work. They completed the anti-freezing maintenance projects for pipelines, machinery, and drilling rigs. Workers harvested reeds to make reed mats to replace wood and adobe bricks for construction; in many places where wood had to be used, they cut down red willows growing on the Gobi Desert. As a result of the extensive use of reeds instead of wood, each drilling team saved nearly fifteen to twenty cubic meters of wood. The workers also prepared a large amount of firewood for the winter. When there were no vehicles to transport the reeds and firewood, the workers carried them on their backs or dragged them to the drilling rigs with ropes. When installing boilers at each drilling rig, there was no crane to erect the chimney. Zhou Guanghai, a fitter at the drilling site, created a wooden crane to erect the chimney. The drilling teams in the Ulkho area also universally dug anti-freezing water wells next to the drilling rigs to solve the problem of water supply in winter.

### 克拉玛依展开群众性防寒工作

　　克拉玛依展开群众性防寒工作
    新华社克拉玛依6日电　最近，在克拉玛依、乌尔禾等石油探区，有一百八十一个工人和十五个单位因冬季防寒准备工作中的优秀成绩受到有关部门的奖励。
    自9月份以来，克拉玛依矿区全面展开了群众性的防寒工作。职工们克服了建筑材料、车辆和工具不足的困难，在戈壁滩上建筑起供冬季住宿，储藏物资和工作用的地窖，完成了管线、机械和钻井的防冻维护工程。工人采割了芦苇制成苇帘，代替建筑用的木料和砖坯；在许多必须用木料的地方，他们就砍伐戈壁滩上生长的红柳来使用。由于大量采用芦苇代替木材的结果，每个钻井队差不多都节省了十五到二十立方公尺的木料。工人们还准备下了大量的冬季烧柴。芦苇和烧柴没有汽车运送，工人们就自己背或用绳子拖到钻井上。各个钻井在装锅炉的时候，没有吊车竖不起烟囱，钻井处钳工周光海创造了一种木吊车来竖立烟囱。乌尔禾地区的各钻井队还普遍地在钻井旁边挖了防冻水井，解决冬季供水问题。
