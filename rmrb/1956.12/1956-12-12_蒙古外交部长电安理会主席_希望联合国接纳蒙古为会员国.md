Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, 10th: The Foreign Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic, A. Ajilbish, said in a telegram to the President of the United Nations Security Council that the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic was satisfied with the Security Council's decision to discuss the admission of the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations on December 12, 1956.

Ajilbish expressed regret that the United Nations had rejected Mongolia's request to have Mongolian observers attend the United Nations meeting when Mongolia's admission was discussed.

The telegram stated that the Mongolian people and government hoped that when discussing the admission of Mongolia to the United Nations, the Security Council's member states would fully understand and correctly treat our request.

(Editor's Note) The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic submitted applications to join the United Nations three times, in 1946, 1948, and 1955. Due to the obstruction of the discriminatory policy of the United States, the Mongolian People's Republic has been excluded from the United Nations. Last year, the Tenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly passed by an overwhelming majority of fifty-two votes to two, Canada's proposal to simultaneously admit eighteen countries, including the Mongolian People's Republic, to the United Nations. However, when the Security Council discussed the General Assembly's proposal, the question of admitting the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations was again delayed due to the use of the "veto" by the Chiang Kai-shek elements instigated by the United States.

### 蒙古外交部长电安理会主席  希望联合国接纳蒙古为会员国

    蒙古外交部长电安理会主席
    希望联合国接纳蒙古为会员国
    据新华社11日讯　据塔斯社乌兰巴托10日讯：蒙古人民共和国外交部长阿吉尔毕希在拍给联合国安全理事会主席的电报中说，蒙古人民共和国政府满意地接受了安全理事会决定在1956年12月12日讨论接纳蒙古人民共和国加入联合国的通知。
    阿吉尔毕希对联合国拒绝蒙古要求当联合国会议讨论接纳蒙古的问题时蒙古派观察员列席这件事，表示遗憾。
    电报中说，蒙古人民和政府希望在讨论接纳蒙古加入联合国问题时，安全理事会的各理事国能充分体谅和正确地对待我们的请求。
    （编者注）蒙古人民共和国政府曾在1946年、1948年和1955年先后三次提出申请参加联合国。由于美国歧视性政策的阻挠，蒙古人民共和国一直被排斥在联合国之外。去年联合国大会第十届会议曾经以五十二票对两票的压倒多数通过了加拿大关于同时接纳包括蒙古人民共和国在内的十八国加入联合国组织的建议。但是，在安全理事会讨论联大这个建议时，关于接纳蒙古人民共和国加入联合国组织的问题，竟因受美国唆使的蒋介石分子使用“否决权”而又被搁延了。
