　  Pay attention to the care of draught cattle during the handover between new and old cooperatives

　  After the primary agricultural producers' cooperatives in Hunan Province merged and upgraded, the public cattle of many small cooperatives were transferred to the large cooperatives. The privately owned, rented, and newly joined individual farmers' draught cattle were also converted into shares and entered the cooperatives. During this handover process, some small cooperatives believed that since the cattle belonged to the large cooperatives, the large cooperatives should be responsible for their care. The large cooperatives, on the other hand, believed that the current production year had not yet ended, and it was not yet time to take over the cattle, so the original old cooperatives should be responsible for the care of the draught cattle. Some large cooperatives, although announcing that the cattle would be handed over at the end of the year or next spring, still allowed the original owners and original keepers to raise them, but there were no specific regulations regarding feed, remuneration, and protection usage systems. As a result, many cooperatives experienced a phenomenon of draught cattle being uncared for or poorly cared for, leading to a large number of draught cattle losing condition, being lost, and dying. For example, in Luobu Zhou, Haohe Township, Xiangyin County, in mid-October, more than one hundred cattle, of unknown origin, died, and no one claimed them on the continent. Some cattle were taken by nearby agricultural cooperatives to pull waterwheels. The Xiangyin County Committee of the Communist Party of China notified various townships to find back dozens of them, and there were still forty-two cattle unclaimed. Qizhou Cooperative had five cattle belonging to new members recorded on the books as having been converted into shares and entered the cooperative, but it was unknown where the cattle went. Since the merger and upgrade of cooperatives began in Yueyang County in early September, more than two hundred and ten cattle have died due to poor care. We believe that this issue needs to attract attention in the work of merging and upgrading cooperatives in various regions. Otherwise, it will cause great difficulties for next year's production.　Xiang Nong

　  新社老社交接的时候要注意耕牛的护养
    湖南省的初级农业生产合作社在并社升级以后，许多小社的公牛已转归大社所有，原来私有租用和新入社的个体农民的耕牛，也都折价入了社。在这个新、老交接过程中，有的小社认为牛已归大社，养护应由大社负责；大社则认为今年生产年度还未结束，还不到接收的时候，耕牛护养应归原老社负责。有的大社虽然宣布年底或明年春天交牛，现在仍由原主和原来的饲养员饲养，但是关于饲料，报酬和保护使用制度等都没有具体规定。这样，就发生许多社耕牛无人护养或护养不好的现象，以致造成大批耕牛退膘，丢失和死亡。如湘阴县濠河乡罗卜洲在10月中旬有一百多头牛不知是那里来的，死了两头在洲上也无人领，有的牛被附近的农业社牵去拉水车，中共湘阴县委通知各乡找回去几十头，还有四十二条牛没有人认领。奇洲社的账上有新社员五头牛折价入了社，但不知牛到那里去了。岳阳县自9月上旬开始并社升级以来，由于护养不好，全县死亡了二百一十多头牛。我们认为这个问题有必要引起各个地区在并社升级工作中注意。否则，将给来年生产造成很大困难。　湘农
