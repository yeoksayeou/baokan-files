    Facing Temporary Inconvenience
    He Cheng

    The supply of pork on the market cannot meet the demand, and consumers in both urban and rural areas feel it is inconvenient. Fundamentally, this is a result of pork production not keeping up with the growing needs, a phenomenon that is difficult to avoid during large-scale economic construction.

    How should we deal with this temporary inconvenience? This is a test of the revolutionary quality of the staff in each unit. Most collective catering units in government offices, troops, factories, and enterprises are law-abiding, abide by the system, share weal and woe with the masses, and have set an example for the masses in this matter.

    However, there are also some collective catering units that fail to do this. In order to satisfy their appetite, they can violate discipline and disregard the impact. For example, some catering units in Beijing, having already obtained pork supplied by commercial departments, still send purchasing personnel to join the citizens in line to buy pork supplied to the citizens. As a result, citizens have even fewer opportunities to buy pork.

    There are even worse cases than this. For example, some catering units, not satisfied with the quantity supplied by urban commercial departments, even send purchasing personnel, sitting in trucks, deep into the countryside to purchase live pigs from farmers at high prices. The Benxi County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party bought seven pigs in October. The Railway Brigade of Suizhong County, Liaoning Province, bought seventy pigs in October. More than 200 live pigs, which were already ordered by the state from two townships in Suizhong County, have been snatched away by these uninvited guests; many pigs have been purchased by force in other townships as well.

    Pork production is constantly developing. However, to breed more piglets, we must first have more grown-up sows and breeding pigs; and piglets cannot grow up just by blowing a breath. Under these circumstances, if those who should not eat more do eat more, the pork supply situation will naturally become even more "tense". People who originally could buy pork cannot buy it now, and workers engaged in special needs of meat, such as high-altitude, high-temperature, and underground operations, as well as patients and postpartum women, find it even more difficult to obtain the supplies they deserve. Moreover, the result of such illegal purchases will inevitably and inappropriately raise the selling price of live pigs, making farmers dissatisfied with the state's reasonable price for purchasing live pigs, and causing many unnecessary difficulties for the state's work of purchasing live pigs and supplying pork. The cost of these people's appetite is too high.

    The state has many laws, systems, policies, and regulations; which of them does their practice comply with?

    It is said that Confucius resigned from his official position in anger because he did not get to eat sacrificial meat; but he did not break the law. Those who always want to eat more meat, as mentioned above, will certainly not resign from their "official positions," but they should not break the law either. For the sake of the country, and for their own sake, they should quickly stop that bad practice!

    在暂时的不方便面前
    何成
    市场上猪肉供不应求，城乡消费者都感到不够方便。从根本上来说，这是生猪生产赶不上日益增长的需要的结果，是大规模经济建设中难以避免的现象。
    怎样对待这种暂时的不方便呢？这对于各单位的工作人员的革命品质是一个考验。多数机关、部队、厂矿、企业的集体伙食单位，奉公守法，遵守制度，和群众同甘共苦，在这件事情上也作了群众的表率。
    可是，也有一些集体伙食单位不能作到这一点。他们为了满足口腹之欲，可以败坏纪律，不顾影响。例如，北京有些伙食单位，本来已经取得商业部门供应的猪肉，可是还派遣采购人员，夹在市民群中，排队购买供应给市民的猪肉。这样一来，市民买到猪肉的机会就更少了。
    还有比这个更恶劣的。例如，有些伙食单位，不满足于城市商业部门供应的数量，竟然派了采购人员，坐着卡车，深入乡间，高价向农民采购生猪。中共本溪县委机关10月份就买了七头猪。辽宁省绥中县铁路大队10月份买了七十头。绥中县两个乡早由国家订购的生猪，已被这些不速之客抢去两百多头；别的乡被抢购的也不少。
    生猪生产在不断发展。可是，要繁殖更多的小猪，得先有更多长大了的母猪、种猪；小猪也并不是吹一口气就能长大的。在这情况下，不该多吃的如果多吃了，猪肉的供应情况自然就更加“紧张”了，原来能买上猪肉的人现在买不上了，特殊需要肉食的高空、高温、地下作业工人和病人、产妇等等，就更加不容易得到应有的供应了。而且这样非法抢购的结果，必然不适当地抬高生猪的售价，使农民不满意国家收购生猪的合理价格，给国家收购生猪、供应猪肉的工作造成许多不应有的困难。这些人的口腹之欲的代价太大了。
    国家有许多法律、制度、政策、规章；他们这种作法，究竟合乎那一条呀！
    据说，孔夫子因为没有吃到祭肉，愤而辞官；可是没有犯法。上边说的那些总想多吃点儿肉的人，当然不会辞“官”，可是也不应该犯法。为了国家，也为了他们自己，赶快把那种坏作法收起来吧！
