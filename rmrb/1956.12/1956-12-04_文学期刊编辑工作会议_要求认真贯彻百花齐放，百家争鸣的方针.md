　　Literary Journal Editorial Work Conference
　　Requires Conscientious Implementation of the Policy of Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Literary Journal Editorial Work Conference, which concluded in Beijing on December 1, emphasized that literary publications should remove obstacles and boldly "ming" ("let a hundred schools of thought contend") and boldly "fang" ("let a hundred flowers bloom") to promote a thriving literary and artistic creation.
    The editors spoke freely at the meeting, and unanimously agreed that to truly implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," it is necessary to be bold and unfettered: dare to publish various different opinions in publications and conduct free debates; publish diverse forms of works, and promote the development of various forms of art; dare to intervene in life and publish works that criticize shortcomings in real life.
    The meeting believed that to run a publication well, each publication must have its own distinct propositions, distinct national styles, and local characteristics.
    The meeting also emphasized the need to attach importance to promoting the traditions of literature and art of fraternal ethnic minorities, introducing each other's ethnic literature, and promoting its improvement.
    The meeting believed that the holding of each publication and its size should be determined according to the needs of readers and the conditions of authors and editors, and opposed the tendency to be greedy and seek bigness. Some regions with too many publications can consider merging them.
    The meeting proposed that each publication should have a united and creative editorial department. This editorial department should be full of an atmosphere of free academic debate and a serious work style. Editors should maintain close contact with the masses of the people and give them time to go deep into life and write.
    The meeting put forward several new measures. From January 1957, all literary journals across the country will abolish the title of "organ journal." Literary and art organizations will only provide guidance on principles and policies for their affiliated publications, and will not interfere in their daily editorial work. There is no guiding or leading relationship between publications across the country, and they can all criticize each other.

　  文学期刊编辑工作会议
　　要求认真贯彻百花齐放，百家争鸣的方针
    据新华社讯　12月1日在北京结束的文学期刊编辑工作会议强调文学刊物要扫除障碍，大胆地鸣
  （“百家争鸣”）、大胆地放（“百花齐放”），促使文艺创作欣欣向荣。
    编辑们在会上畅所欲言，一致认为要真正贯彻实行“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，必须大胆放手：敢于在刊物上发表各种不同的见解，开展自由论争；发表多种多样形式的作品，并且促使各种文艺形式得以发展；敢于干预生活，发表批评现实生活中的缺点的作品。
    会议认为要办好一个刊物，必须要求每个刊物各自有着鲜明的主张；鲜明的民族风格和地方色采。
    会议还强调要重视发扬兄弟民族文学艺术的传统，相互介绍各民族的文学，并促使它提高。
    会议认为，每个刊物的举办和它的篇幅的大、小，应当根据读者的需要、作者和编辑人员的条件而定，反对贪多求大的倾向。某些出版刊物过多的地区可以酌量合并。
    会议提出每个刊物都要有一个团结的有创造性的编辑部。这个编辑部要充满着学术上的自由论辩的空气和严肃的工作作风。编辑人员要和人民群众保持密切的联系，要给他们深入生活和写作的时间。
    会议提出了几项新的措施。从1957年1月起，全国各个文学期刊一律取消机关刊物的名义。文艺团体对所属刊物只作原则方针上的领导，不干涉其日常编辑工作。全国各个刊物之间没有指导或领导关系，彼此都可以相互批评。
