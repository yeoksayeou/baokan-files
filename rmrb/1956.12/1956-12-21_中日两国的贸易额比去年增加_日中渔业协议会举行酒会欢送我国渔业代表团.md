    Sino-Japanese Trade Volume Increases Over Last Year
    Japan-China Fisheries Council Hosts Reception to See Off Chinese Fisheries Delegation
    Xinhua News Agency, 20th -- Tokyo Dispatch: According to statistics released yesterday by the Japan-China Export-Import Association, Japan's exports to China this year will reach 65 million US dollars, more than double that of last year.
    In 1955, the total trade volume between Japan and China was 110 million US dollars, with Japan's exports accounting for a small proportion, only 29 million US dollars, and China's exports accounting for 81 million US dollars. This year, the total trade volume between the two countries is estimated to be around 150 million US dollars, with China's exports being around 85 million US dollars. Although Japan's exports have increased to 65 million US dollars, they are still far from the target of 30 million pounds (84 million US dollars) stipulated in the Sino-Japanese trade agreement due to embargo restrictions.
    Since the beginning of this year, various machines and chemicals have seen a relatively large increase in Japanese exports, with a particularly significant increase in the second half of the year. Some of these exports are embargoed goods.
    On the import side, Japan's imports of Chinese mineral products (including coal and salt) increased significantly between April and September, accounting for 23.4% of Japan's total imports from China, compared with only 12.7% in the same period last year.
    Xinhua News Agency, 20th -- Tokyo Dispatch: The Japan-China Fisheries Council held a reception last night to see off the visiting delegation of the China Fisheries Association. About eighty well-known figures from the Japanese fishing industry, including the chairman of the Japan-China Fisheries Council, Tsunejiro Hiratsuka, attended.
    Since arriving in Tokyo on November 21, the visiting delegation of the China Fisheries Association has held several talks with the Japan-China Fisheries Council and visited various parts of Japan, inspecting fishing ports, fishing gear factories, etc. After holding the final talks with the Japan-China Fisheries Council yesterday morning, the delegation concluded its entire itinerary and is about to depart for home.

    中日两国的贸易额比去年增加
    日中渔业协议会举行酒会欢送我国渔业代表团
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：据日中输出入协会昨天发表的统计，今年日本向中国的出口将达到六千五百万美元，比去年将增加一倍多。
    1955年，日中两国贸易总额是一亿一千万美元，其中日本出口额比重很小，只占二千九百万美元，中国的出口额是八千一百万美元，今年，两国贸易总额估计是一亿五千万美元左右，其中，中国出口八千五百万美元左右，日本的出口虽然增加到六千五百万美元，但因受禁运限制，距离中日贸易协定所规定的目标三千万英镑（八千四百万美元）还较远。
    今年以来，在日本的出口货物中增加得比较多的是各种机器和化学品。下半年增加尤为显著。在这些出口货物中，有一部分是禁运物资。
    在进口方面，日本在4月到9月期间，进口的中国矿产品（包括煤、盐）有显著增加，占日本从中国进口总额的23.4％，而去年同期只占进口总额的12.7％。
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本日中渔业协议会昨天晚间举行酒会，欢送中国渔业协会访日代表团。日中渔业协议会会长平冡常次郎等日本渔业界知名人士约八十人出席作陪。
    中国渔业协会访日代表团自从11月21日到达东京以后，同日中渔业协议会举行了多次会谈，并且访问了日本各地，参观了渔港、渔具制造厂等。代表团昨天上午同日中渔业协议会举行最后一次会谈后，结束了全部日程，即将启程回国。
