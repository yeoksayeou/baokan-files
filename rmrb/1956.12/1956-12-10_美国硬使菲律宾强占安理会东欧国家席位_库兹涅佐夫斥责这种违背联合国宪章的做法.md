Xinhua News Agency, December 8th, New York: According to TASS, the United Nations General Assembly held a plenary meeting on the morning of the 7th to elect a non-permanent member of the Security Council to replace Yugoslavia, which was withdrawing from the Security Council. In the first secret ballot, the Philippine candidate received 51 votes; the Czechoslovak candidate received 20 votes. Thus, the UN Charter and the agreement on the fair regional distribution of seats for non-permanent members of the Security Council were disregarded, and the Philippines was forcibly made to occupy the seat of an Eastern European country on the Security Council.

After the election results were announced, the head of the Soviet delegation, Kuznetsov, issued a statement saying that this was a serious infringement on the legitimate rights of Eastern European countries in the United Nations. According to the provisions of the UN Charter and the 1946 London Gentleman's Agreement, one of the six non-permanent member seats of the Council is allocated to Eastern European countries. Now, allowing the Philippines, which has no connection with the Eastern European region, to occupy the seat that should belong to an Eastern European country is clearly a violation of the principles of the United Nations.

Kuznetsov condemned this arbitrary and illegal practice of excluding countries in the Eastern European region from one of the most important bodies of the United Nations. He accused certain groups of countries, primarily the United States, of using the United Nations to achieve their own selfish goals.

Kuznetsov solemnly declared that the Soviet delegation firmly protested against this discrimination against Eastern European countries.

### 美国硬使菲律宾强占安理会东欧国家席位  库兹涅佐夫斥责这种违背联合国宪章的做法

　　美国硬使菲律宾强占安理会东欧国家席位
　  库兹涅佐夫斥责这种违背联合国宪章的做法
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会7日上午全体会议投票选举了安全理事会的一个非常任理事国来代替退出安全理事会的南斯拉夫。在第一次秘密投票中，菲律宾的候选人获得五十一票；捷克斯洛伐克的候选人获得二十票。就这样，联合国宪章和关于按地区公平分配安全理事会非常任理事国席位的协议被置之不顾，而硬使菲律宾占据了安全理事会中东欧国家的席位。
    在选举结果宣布之后，苏联代表团团长库兹涅佐夫发表声明说，这是对东欧国家在联合国合法权利的严重侵害。按照联合国宪章的规定和1946年的伦敦君子协定，理事会非常任理事国六个席位中有一个席位是分配给东欧国家的。现在让同东欧地区毫不相干的菲律宾占据理应属于东欧国家的席位，这显然是违背联合国的原则的。
    库兹涅佐夫谴责这种把东欧地区的国家排除出联合国一个最重要的机构之外的专横和违法的做法。他指责某些国家集团，首先是美国，利用联合国来达到利己的目的。
    库兹涅佐夫郑重声明，苏联代表团坚决抗议对东欧国家的这种歧视。
