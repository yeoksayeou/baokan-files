Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 25th. The high mountains and deep valleys of Northwest China are already covered with ice and snow, but six drilling teams are still working in the field in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces, carrying out winter coal exploration.

	In the Weibei coalfield in Shaanxi, the Shizuishan and Yaojie coalfields at the foot of the Qilian Mountains in Gansu, the Shandan and Yongchang coalfields in the Hexi Corridor, and the Datong mining area on the southern foot of the Daban Mountains in the Qinghai Plateau, the drilling rigs are already set up with tightly sealed cold-proof sheds, and the field activity houses where the drilling workers live are covered with thick woolen felt, and stoves are lit indoors. Field drilling workers working in the coldest areas have received leather coats and cotton shoes and hats. In the next three months, they will brave the severe cold of minus ten to thirty degrees Celsius to complete 25,000 meters of drilling work, accurately explore six well fields and generally survey two well fields for the country.

	Since 1953, geological personnel have discovered many new coalfields with rich reserves in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces. However, the coal mining volume in this area is still far from meeting the actual needs. This year, in order to accelerate the basic construction of the coal industry, the drilling volume of the Northwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau has increased by 50% compared with last year. This winter is also the winter with the largest drilling volume.

    白雪下面找黑煤
    新华社西安25日电　西北地区的高山深谷已经盖上了冰雪，六个钻探队仍然坚持在陕西、甘肃、青海三省的野外，展开冬季找煤工作。
    在陕西的渭北煤田，甘肃祁连山麓的石咀山、窑街煤田，河西走廊的山丹、永昌煤田和青海高原大板山南麓的大通矿区，正在钻探的钻机已经搭好了严密的御寒篷，钻探工人住的野外活动房子已经盖上厚厚的羊毛毡，室内都生了火炉。在最寒冷地区工作的野外钻探工人，都领到了皮大衣和棉鞋帽。他们要在今后三个月里，冒着摄氏零下十度到三十度的严寒，完成两万五千公尺的钻探工作量，为国家精探出六个井田和普查出两个井田。
    自1953年以来，地质人员在陕、甘、青三省已经发现了许多储量丰富的新煤田。但是，这个地区的煤炭开采量还是远远赶不上实际需要。今年为要加速煤炭工业的基本建设，西北煤田地质勘探局的钻探量已经比去年增加了50％。今年冬季也是钻探量最多的一个冬季。
