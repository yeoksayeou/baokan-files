    A Visit to Tunisia
    Li Xuechun
    (VIII) The Past and Present of the "Granary of Rome"
    On August 10th, we left Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, and arrived in Béja, Tunisia's largest wheat-producing region. This area was known as the "Granary of Rome" during the Roman rule of Tunisia due to its abundant wheat production.
    Béja is located in northwestern Tunisia, more than one hundred kilometers from Tunis. Our car sped along the rolling hills of the Atlas Mountains at a speed of eighty kilometers per hour. On both sides, sparsely scattered white-domed small farmhouses were visible, their surroundings barren, without trees or grass. The wheat had just been harvested, and the red soil stretched endlessly. Due to four consecutive years of drought, the wheat harvest was not good. It is said that all the rivers in the country, except for the largest one, have dried up, and the Tunisians call these rivers "Oueds" (meaning dry river). Hot winds blowing from the Sahara Desert in the south constantly drove away the moist, cool air drifting in from the Mediterranean Sea, and dryness threatened the entire Tunisian land.
    The land of Tunisia is fertile, and the people mainly eat wheat. A single good wheat harvest can last for several years, and there is an inexhaustible supply of olives and wild figs. The hardworking and brave Tunisian farmers have accumulated rich farming experience over thousands of years. Taking the fight against drought as an example, the farmers of Béja built perfect irrigation facilities as early as two thousand years ago. These are not ordinary artificial channels, but irrigation aqueducts raised high above the rolling hills. These aqueducts have been preserved and used for more than two thousand years, but they are now even more perfect than before. It is precisely because of these long-standing irrigation facilities that Béja farmers were able to obtain a harvest of 1,500 jin of wheat per hectare even after four consecutive years of severe drought. The post-independence Tunisian government is organizing the people of Béja to build five medium-sized water conservancy irrigation and hydroelectric power projects.
    Since the French colonialists set foot on Tunisian soil more than seventy years ago, the fertile land and good irrigation facilities in the Béja region have ceased to bring a happy life to the people of Béja. The lives of the people of Béja have become increasingly impoverished. French colonialists seized large tracts of land from Tunisian farmers, and four French real estate companies in Tunisia alone seized approximately 140,800 hectares of the most fertile land from Tunisian farmers. Four hundred and fifty of the five hundred largest landowners in the Béja region were French. French colonialists seized one-fifth of all cultivated land in Tunisia, equivalent to four-fifths of the most fertile land in Tunisia. Tunisia is one of the countries with the highest olive oil production in the world, but under the control of the French colonialists, Tunisian farmers could not find a market for their olives, and large quantities of olives were left to rot on the ground. Currently, there are approximately 500,000 farmers in Tunisia who have been deprived of their land, displaced from their homes, wandering around, unable to find work, and forced to struggle on the brink of death.
    Many Tunisian friends we met were worried about the serious agricultural situation in their country. They are seeking ways to solve the agricultural problem, and many have already proposed land nationalization and the implementation of agricultural collectivization to the government. The post-independence Tunisian government faces serious tasks in agriculture. (To be continued)

    突尼斯访问记
    李学纯
    （八）“罗马谷仓”的今昔
    8月10日，我们离开了突尼斯首都——突尼斯市，来到了突尼斯最大的产麦区贝扎。这个地区在罗马统治突尼斯的时代曾因盛产小麦而获得“罗马谷仓”的称号。
    贝扎在突尼斯西北部，距离突尼斯市百余公里。我们的汽车以每小时八十公里的速度在连绵起伏的阿特拉斯山脉的丘陵公路上奔驰。两旁，散布着稀稀疏疏的白色的圆顶的小农庄，农庄周围光秃秃的，既没有树，也没有青草。小麦刚收割过，红色的土地一望无际。由于遭遇到一连四年的旱灾，小麦的收成不太好。据说全国除了最大的一条河以外，所有的河都干涸了，突尼斯人把这些河叫做“乳厄特”（干河的意思）。从南方撒哈拉沙漠上吹来的热风，不时赶走了从地中海上飘来的湿润的凉气，干燥威胁着整个突尼斯的大地。
    突尼斯的土地是肥沃的，人民以小麦为主食，小麦丰收一次，几年都吃不完，还有吃不尽的橄榄和野无花果。勤劳而勇敢的突尼斯农民，几千年来积累了丰富的耕作经验。单就与旱灾作斗争来说，贝扎的农民早在两千多年前就修建了完善的灌溉设备。这不是普通的人工渠道，而是一条条高架在连绵起伏的丘陵之间的灌溉孔道。这些孔道一直保留和使用了两千多年，不过现在比从前更加完善罢了。正是由于有了这些历史悠久的灌溉设备，贝扎农民才在连续四年大旱的情况下还得到了每公顷一千五百斤小麦的收获。独立后的突尼斯政府，正在组织贝扎人民兴建五座中型的水利灌溉和水力发电工程。
    自从法国殖民主义者在七十余年前踏上了突尼斯国土以来，贝扎地区肥沃的土地和良好的灌溉设备就不再给贝扎人民带来幸福的生活了。贝扎人民的生活越来越贫困了。法国殖民主义者剥夺了突尼斯农民的大片土地，仅四家法国在突尼斯的地产公司就夺去了突尼斯农民的约十四万零八百公顷最肥沃的土地。贝扎地区五百个大地主中就有四百五十个是法国人。法国殖民主义者夺去了突尼斯全部耕地的五分之一，相当于突尼斯最肥沃的土地的五分之四。突尼斯是世界上橄榄油产量最高的国家之一，但是在法国殖民主义者的控制下，突尼斯农民的橄榄找不到销路，大量的橄榄任其腐烂在地上。现在，突尼斯全国约有五十万被剥夺了土地的农民，离乡背井，四处流浪，找不到工作，被迫挣扎在死亡线上。
    我们所遇到的许多突尼斯朋友，都为他们国家的严重的农业状况而担忧。他们正在寻求解决农业问题的道路，已有不少的人向政府提出了土地国有化和实行农业合作化的建议。独立后的突尼斯政府在农业方面面临着严重的任务。（未完）
