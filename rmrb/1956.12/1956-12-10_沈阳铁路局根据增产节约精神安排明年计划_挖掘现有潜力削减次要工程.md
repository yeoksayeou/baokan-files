    Shenyang Railway Bureau Arranges Next Year's Plan According to the Spirit of Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
    Exploiting Existing Potential and Cutting Back on Secondary Projects
    (Our newspaper, Shenyang, 9th dispatch) The Shenyang Railway Bureau, according to the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, has reduced the investment in projects that can be postponed in next year's basic construction plan by 43 million yuan after investigation and research. If these funds are used in the areas most urgently needed by the country, they can lay more than 330 kilometers of railway. Among the engineering investments cut back this time is the planned restoration of the double track from Wujiatun to Shiqiaozi on the Shenyang-Anshan line, with an investment of 13 million yuan. However, the increase in transportation volume between this section of the line will not be significant next year, and there is still great potential that has not been exploited. Similar to this situation, the projects that were cut back also include the double-track project between Benxi and Nanfen, between Yuhong and Yuguo, and in eight work zones on the Changda Line.
    It was originally determined that 3.6 million yuan would be invested next year between Changchun and Taolaizhao to install automatic block equipment. According to the situation that the increase in transportation volume on this line segment next year is not large, and the current operating capacity has not yet reached saturation, it was also determined not to install it next year. The projects that have been reduced also include office buildings, platforms, warehouses, etc. Their reduction was determined after investigation and research and three reviews and discussions by the Party organization before and after, on a positive and steady basis.
    The basic construction investment proposed by various departments of the Bureau for next year was initially equivalent to three times this year's investment. In order to find out the situation and correct the blind pursuit of quantity and grand ambitions of some cadres, the Party organization organized design, planning, engineering, and other business departments to form an investigation team. With the help of relevant economic planning departments in various places, a more comprehensive investigation and research was conducted on the transportation volume, cargo flow direction, and other conditions for next year, and the investment was reduced to a level 90.7% higher than this year. The Party organization further studied and believed that there is great potential in management and transportation, and that the method of exploiting existing potential should be used to replace some of the originally planned new projects. Therefore, the various projects were divided into three categories: urgently needed construction, generally needed, and postponable, and they were lined up and reviewed item by item. The first category of projects was affirmed, the second category of projects would not be built for the time being if possible, and the third category of projects would be postponed across the board. After such queuing, categorization, and item-by-item review, three investment plans were set, and the investment amount was reduced to one-half to one-third of the original plan. After another discussion and review by the Party organization, a plan that was slightly higher than the lowest investment amount was determined. Compared with the original plan, the investment amount was reduced by more than half. After the determination, the Party organization also held an enlarged meeting to explain the situation to the cadres of various departments, and criticized the blind pursuit of quantity and grand ambitions.

    沈阳铁路局根据增产节约精神安排明年计划
    挖掘现有潜力削减次要工程
    本报沈阳9日电　沈阳铁路管理局根据增产节约精神，经过调查研究，压缩了明年基本建设计划中可以缓办的工程投资四千三百万元。这些资金如果放在国家最急需的地方，可以铺设三百三十多公里铁路。在这次削减的工程投资中，有原计划修复沈安线上吴家屯到石桥子的复线，投资一千三百万元。但是明年这段线路间的运输量增加不多，而现在又有很大潜力没有发挥。类似这种情形而被削减的工程还有本溪到南芬之间和于洪到裕国之间以及长大线上的八个工区的复线工程。
    长春到陶赖昭之间原确定明年投资三百六十万元安置自动闭塞装置。根据明年这一线段运输量增加不多，和目前运行能力尚未达到饱和状态的情况，也确定不在明年安设。被削减的工程中还包括有办公大楼、站台、仓库等，它们的削减都是经过调查研究和党组织前后三次审查、讨论，在积极而又稳妥的基础上确定下来的。
    管理局各部门起初提出的明年基本建设投资相当于今年投资的三倍。党组织为了摸清情况并纠正某些干部盲目贪多图大的思想，组织了设计、计划、工程以及其他各业务部门成立调查组，在各地有关经济计划部门的帮助下，对明年的运输量、货流方向等情况作了较全面的调查研究，把投资压缩到比今年增加90.7％的水平上。党组织又进一步研究，认为目前管理运输等方面都有很大潜力，应该以挖掘现有潜力的方法代替原计划新建的某些工程。于是，又把各项工程分为急需建设的，一般需要的和可以缓办的三类，进行排队，逐项审查，把第一类的工程肯定下来，第二类工程如果可能暂时不建就不建，第三类工程则一律缓建。这样排队、分类逐项审查之后，定下三个投资方案，投资额减少到原计划的二分之一到三分之一。经党组织再一次讨论、审查，确定了比最低投资额稍高一些的方案，如与原计划相比，投资额削减了一半还多。确定后，党组织还召开了扩大会，对各部门干部作了说明，并批评了盲目贪多图大的冒进情绪。
