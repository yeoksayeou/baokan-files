　　A Record of Dragon Dreams
　　Ma Lan

　　After completing the design of the fifty-second piece of handicraft art for this year, the designer was already dizzy and drowsy.
　　What he was engaged in was a very simple but also very tedious design work, because what he drew was always only one kind of pattern: dragon. Azure Dragon, Yellow Dragon, White Dragon, Black Dragon, Five-Clawed Golden Dragon...; Two Dragons Playing with a Pearl, a Gathering of Dragons, a Dragon Spitting Water, a Dragon Emerging from the Sea, a Circular Dragon... under his colorful brush, countless dragons were writhing and swimming every day.
　　Was this art worker partial to dragons? No, it was not him who loved dragons, but the trade department that commissioned him to design the patterns. Because these dragon-drawing, dragon-embroidering arts and crafts were sold abroad. It is said that foreigners like dragon patterns the most, and some even think that the dragon represents China, which has a four-thousand-year-old cultural history. — This is really a misunderstanding of historical knowledge.
　　In order to cater to their preferences, many art and craft products going abroad were painted with dragons and embroidered with dragons, from tableware to pajamas and slippers.
　　Apart from dragons, other patterns were unthinkable: there was no need for them at all.
　　"I hope this is the last dragon," the designer yawned and muttered: "Good heavens, let me rest. For the fifty-third one, I hope it's a Chinese landscape, or even just two flowers!"
　　Before he finished speaking, the section chief who assigned him the new task arrived: "Old buddy, this time we need to change the pattern, use your brain, this represents our country."
　　"That's great, what pattern do you want to change to?" The designer perked up and jumped up from the pile of dragon sketches, wide awake: "What should I draw? Figures? Flowers and birds? Landscapes?"
　　"No. We hope you can design a new pattern that has never existed before: a flying dragon." The section chief, afraid that he would not understand, gave him a gesture that resembled a swimming dragon:
　　"Got it? Flying dragon, a dragon that can fly."
　　Seeing that the designer had no objections, the section chief said, "I'll come and see the design myself in three days," and left; like a dragon appearing and disappearing without a trace, he was gone before anyone could hear his footsteps.
　　The designer's eyes blurred and he became confused again. In order to recapture his long-lost inspiration, he finally fell asleep. At this time, he dreamed of a earth-shattering tornado, he dreamed that he was caught on the dragon's tail and blown eight hundred miles away by the strong wind.

　　梦龙记
　　马蓝
    设计完了今年的第五十二张工艺品美术图案之后，设计师已经眼花缭乱，昏然欲睡了。
    他所从事的是一种极简单而又很容易使人厌倦的设计工作，因为他所画的，永远只有一种图案花纹：龙。青龙、黄龙、白龙、乌龙、五爪金龙……；双龙抢珠，群龙聚首，龙吐水，龙出海，团龙……，在他的彩笔之下，每天都有无数的龙在蜿蜒游动。
    是这位美术工作者对龙有偏爱吗？不是，爱龙的并不是他，而是委托他设计图案花纹的贸易部门。因为这些绘龙、绣龙的工艺美术品是卖到国外去的。据说，外国人最喜欢的就是龙的图案花纹，甚至于有人以为龙是代表我们这个有四千年文化历史的中国的。——这实在是个历史知识的误会。
    为了投其所好，许多出国的美术工艺品上都画了龙、绣了龙，从食具到睡衣拖鞋。
    除了龙，别的图案花纹是想都不容想的：根本用不着。
      “但愿这是最后一张龙了。”设计师打着呵欠，喃喃地说：“老天爷，让我休息休息。第五十三张，我希望是张中国山水，画两朵花也行啊！”
    一语未完，给他布置新任务的那位科长到了：“老兄，这一次我们要换一个花样，动动脑筋吧，这可是代表咱们国家的。”
    “那可好，你说换什么花样？”设计师精神抖擞，清醒地从那堆龙的草图里跳起来：“画什么？人物？花鸟？山水？”
      “不。我们希望您设计一种过去没有过的新花样：飞龙。”科长怕他听不明白，又给他表演了一个宛若游龙的姿势：
      “懂啦？飞龙，会飞的龙。”
    看看设计师并没有反对意见，科长就说了声“三天后我自己来看样子”，走了；神龙见首不见尾，没有听见脚步声就不见了人。
    设计师两眼发花，又糊涂起来。为了追索自己的失去已久的灵感，他终于昏昏睡去。这时他梦见了惊天动地的龙卷风，他梦见自己被卷在龙尾巴上，给大风刮了八百里。
