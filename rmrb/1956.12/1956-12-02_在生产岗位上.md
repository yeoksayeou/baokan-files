　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th. The state-owned Shanghai Motor Factory successfully trial-produced a Soviet-style 120-kilowatt marine high-speed DC generator on the 24th. This is the last of the 274 new products that the factory was tasked to trial-produce under the First Five-Year Plan.

　　Since the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan, the 1,500-kilowatt, 2,500-kilowatt, 6,000-kilowatt, and 12,000-kilowatt steam turbine generators they successfully trial-produced are important new products of China's machinery industry and are now in mass production.

　　In the past three years, the new products they have made also include 3-cubic-meter electric shovel motors for coal mines, traction motors for industrial and mining use, motors for ships, and 450-kilowatt hydro-generators to support ethnic minorities. The giant 20,000 kVA transformer made by this factory supported the construction of the Shanghai power grid, and the 7,500 kVA high-voltage power transformer supported the Foziling and Meishan reservoirs.

　　Improve Product Quality

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 30th. The Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory has taken measures to improve product quality based on user feedback.

　　From January to mid-November this year, they collected more than 120 pieces of user feedback. From the chief engineer to the relevant departments and production workshops, all paid close attention to studying these sincere evaluations of product quality. The design department accepted user feedback and modified the design of nineteen components.

　　This factory not only includes user feedback forms with its products upon delivery but also establishes regular contact with users, sending letters every quarter to solicit opinions or sending people to visit. In September and October this year, special personnel were sent to visit thirteen coal and iron mines in Jixi, Jiaohe, Benxi, and other places to solicit opinions from workers who use and repair pneumatic tools in the field.

　　The factory has designated personnel to register and supervise the handling of each user suggestion.

　　Roll More High-Quality Steel

　　Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, 30th. The Benxi Steel Plant uses the "continuous rolling method" to roll high-quality electric furnace steel, which allows for more than ten kilograms of steel to be rolled per ton of steel ingot.

　　In the past, when the Benxi Steel Plant rolled steel, it first heated the steel ingot in a heating furnace, rolled it into a steel billet, and then reheated it after the steel billet cooled down before rolling it into steel. The "continuous rolling method" now used rolls the heated steel ingot into steel in one go. The Benxi Steel Plant succeeded in its fourth trial this year. This operation method can save more than one hundred kilograms of coal per ton of steel ingot.

　　Find Chemical Raw Materials from Waste

　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 30th. The Zigong Salt Field in Sichuan extracts a large number of valuable chemical products from the waste liquid left over from salt production.

　　The waste liquid left over from salt production, commonly known as Danba in the salt field, was previously discarded in the wild as waste. After liberation, the Chongqing Industrial Testing Institute of the Ministry of Light Industry and salt field technicians jointly studied the extraction of chemical products from Danba. Potassium chloride, borax, and boric acid are now produced in large quantities, with an annual output of more than 3,000 tons for these three products. In addition, bromine and iodine have been successfully extracted, and magnesium chloride has recently been successfully extracted.

　　Relevant technicians from the Zigong Salt Administration said that more than ten chemical elements have been found in Danba.

　　New Casting Technology

　　Xinhua News Agency report. The casting workshop of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant recently studied the Soviet Union's method of using chemical hardening to make sand molds and cast a large casting weighing twenty-five tons. This is the largest casting in China made using this new technology.

　　The factory began experimenting with this method of molding in April this year and succeeded in September. The sand mold made with this method can be used for casting after only seven or eight minutes, greatly shortening the casting time. Since the casting workshop of this factory adopted the chemical hardening method for production, it has overfulfilled its production plan in September and October.

　　The use of chemical hardening to make sand molds also avoids the deformation or damage of the sand mold due to thermal expansion and contraction or movement because the sand mold does not need to be dried. Therefore, it can ensure that the dimensions of the castings are correct, and it fundamentally improves the working conditions of the workers in the casting workshop.

　　Propose New Production Increase Targets

　　This newspaper reports. Some state-owned light industrial factories in Shenyang City have proposed new production increase targets for more than a dozen products.

　　The rubber sheets and air ducts produced by the Shenyang Fourth Rubber Factory are necessities for newly built mines and factories. This factory has decided to increase production of rubber sheets by 300 tons and air ducts by more than 100,000 meters this year. The Shenyang Paper Mill previously proposed to increase production of 1,100 tons of glazed paper, boxboard paper, oil felt base paper, etc. this year. Recently, they plan to increase production by another 600 tons. The Shenyang Woolen Mill plans to increase production of more than 3,000 meters of plush. The Shenyang Canvas Factory will also produce more than 268,800 meters of canvas for the country by the end of the year. The employees of the Shenyang Brewery will also produce more than 2 million bottles of beer for the people. The employees of the Shenyang Sack Factory will also increase production by 188,800 sacks.

　　After these factories proposed production increase targets, they actively mobilized employees to find ways and formulate specific measures to ensure the fulfillment of their promises.

　　Tap Production Potential

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 30th. According to calculations by the Tianjin Municipal Iron and Steel Industry Company, this year, the city's joint state-private steel rolling mills and steelmaking plants will increase steel production by 130% and steel by 70% due to the exploitation of production potential. It is estimated that steel production this year will exceed the state plan by more than 7,000 tons. The quality of steel has also improved. Last year, most of the steel was Class B, but this year, about 90% is Class A.

　　This year, most of the joint state-private steel rolling mills in Tianjin have increased the speed of the steel rolling machines and adjusted the unreasonable conditions of the heating furnace and steel rolling machine equipment. At the same time, the number of shifts has been increased. The original one or two shifts have been changed to three shifts, and some of the original three shifts have been changed to three and a half shifts. The steel rolling mills have also begun to gradually fix the types of products, which not only does not reduce the specifications and varieties of steel but also solves the problem of low output caused by frequent changes in product specifications in the past.

　　Complete the Plan Ahead of Schedule

　　This newspaper, Baotou, 28th. Due to the development of socialist competition and advanced producer movements, by mid-November, ten factories in the Baotou City local industrial system had completed the production targets of the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and fourteen factories had completed the total annual output value plan ahead of schedule. Six of the seven main products included in the First Five-Year Plan reached the targets set by the First Five-Year Plan one and a half to two years ahead of schedule. By the end of October, the factories under the city's First and Second Local Industry Bureaus had completed an average of 91.3% of the annual plan, reversing the situation of being lax at the beginning and tight at the end in previous years. According to incomplete statistics, 263 advanced units and 2,681 advanced producers and advanced workers emerged in the movement, and 177 advanced experiences were promoted, and more than 1,000 rationalization proposals were adopted.

　　Mining Thin Coal Seams

　　Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, 30th. The Benxi Coal Mine has mined 140,000 tons of coking coal in thin coal seams this year, supplying the iron and steel industries of Anshan and Benxi.

　　The coking coal produced here is very valuable prime coking coal. Before liberation, thin coal seams with a thickness of less than one meter were never mined. In order to save underground resources, the Benxi Coal Mine has added some equipment this year and started to mine these thin coal seams. The mine leadership also mobilized experienced miners to look for thin coal seams underground. The amount of coal reserves that have now been discovered in thin coal seams and residual mining areas totals more than 6 million tons.

　　New Salt Rock Discovered in Zigong

　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 30th. Zigong Salt Field in Sichuan, a well-known well salt production area in the country, recently discovered a new salt rock layer with extremely abundant reserves in Tudi Slope, Zigong City. According to preliminary investigations, within the confirmed salt rock area, there are more than 13 million tons of reserves, which can be mined for twenty-eight years.

　　After testing, the sodium chloride content of the new salt rock is 97.4%. The sodium chloride content of the salt rock in the old salt rock area currently being mined by the salt field is 95%.

　　Leaders of the Zigong Salt Administration said that they are continuing to explore the area and reserves of this new salt rock layer.

    改进产品质量
    据新华社沈阳30电　沈阳风动工具厂根据用户的意见采取措施改进产品质量。
    从今年1月到11月中旬，他们征求到一百二十多件用户的意见。从总工程师到有关科和生产车间，都很注意研究这些对产品质量的忠恳的评价。设计科接受用户意见修改了十九种部件的设计。
    这个厂不仅在产品出厂的时候，附有用户意见书，并且同用户建立经常联系，每个季度都写信去征求意见，或派人去访问。今年九、十月间，曾经派专人到鸡西、蛟河、本溪等十三个煤矿和铁矿去访问，深入现场征求使用风动工具和修理风动工具工人的意见。
    这个厂对待用户提出的每个意见，都设有专人登记、督促对用户意见的处理。
      多轧优质钢材
    据新华社本溪30日电　本溪钢厂采用“连轧法”轧制电炉优质钢材，使每吨钢锭可以多轧出十多公斤钢材。
    本溪钢厂过去轧钢的时候，是先把钢锭在加热炉内烧好，轧成钢坯，等到钢坯冷却以后再加一次热，轧成钢材。现在采用的“连轧法”，是把加热以后的钢锭一下子轧成钢材。本溪钢厂今年先后试验四次才获得成功。这种操作法每吨钢锭可以少烧一百多公斤煤。
  从废物中找化工原料
    据新华社成都30日电　四川自贡盐场从制盐以后剩下的废液中，提制出大量贵重的化工产品。
    制盐以后剩下的废液，在盐场俗称胆巴，过去一向被当作废物弃置野外。解放以后，轻工业部重庆工业试验所和盐场技术人员共同研究从胆巴中提制化工产品。现在已经大量生产的有氯化钾，硼砂和硼酸，这三种产品的年产量在三千吨以上。另外还提制成功了溴和碘，最近又提制成功了氯化镁。
    自贡盐务管理局有关技术人员说，胆巴中含有的化学元素，已经发现的有十多种。
      新铸造技术
    据新华社讯　沈阳重型机器厂铸造车间，最近学习苏联采用化学硬化法造砂型，铸造出一个重二十五吨的大铸件，这是我国采用这一新技术铸造的最大铸件。
    这个厂是从今年4月开始试用这种方法造型的，9月获得成功。采用这种方法造好的砂型，只须经过七、八分钟的时间，就可以用来浇铸铸件，大大缩短了浇铸时间。这个厂的铸造车间自从采用化学硬化法生产以后，9月和10月都超额完成了生产计划。
    采用化学硬化法造砂型，还因为砂型不需要经过烘干的过程，能够避免因热涨冷缩或挪动而使砂型变型或碰坏，因此可以保证它浇铸出来的铸件尺寸正确，并且根本改善了铸造车间工人的劳动条件。
    提出新的增产目标
    本报讯　沈阳市一些国营轻工业工厂，提出了十几种产品新的增产奋斗目标。
    沈阳第四橡胶厂生产的胶板和导风筒，是新建矿井和工厂的必需品。这个厂确定今年增产三百吨的胶板和十万多公尺导风筒。沈阳造纸厂过去提出今年要增产一千一百吨有光纸、箱板纸、油毡原纸等。最近他们又打算再多增产六百吨。沈阳毛织厂准备再增产三千多公尺的长毛绒。沈阳帆布厂也要到年底为国家多生产二十六万八千多公尺的帆布。沈阳啤酒厂的职工也将要为人民多生产二百多万瓶啤酒。沈阳麻袋厂职工，也将再增产十八万八千条麻袋。
    这些工厂提出增产指标以后，都积极发动职工想办法，制定了具体措施，以保证实现自己的诺言。
      挖掘增产潜力
    据新华社天津30日电　据天津市钢铁工业公司计算，今年全市公私合营轧钢厂和炼钢厂由于发掘生产潜力，钢材产量将比去年增加130％，钢将增加70％。预计今年钢材可以超过国家计划七千多吨。钢材质量也提高了，去年绝大部分都是乙类钢材，今年有90％左右都是甲类钢材。
    今年天津市大部分公私合营轧钢厂都加大了轧钢机转数，调整了加热炉和轧钢机设备的不合理状况。同时都增加了班次，原来是一班或两班的都改成三班生产，原来是三班的有的改为三班半。各轧钢厂也开始逐步固定产品类型，不但不减少钢材的规格品种，还解决了过去因为产品规格经常变化而造成的产量低的问题。
    提前完成计划
    本报包头28日电　由于开展社会主义竞赛和先进生产者运动，到11月中旬，包头市地方工业系统已经有十个工厂提前完成第一个五年计划的生产指标，有十四个工厂提前完成今年的国家总产值计划。列入第一个五年计划的七种主要产品，有六种提前一年半至二年的时间达到第一个五年计划所规定的指标。到10月底，市第一、第二地方工业局所属各厂，平均完成年计划的91.3％，扭转了历年来前松后紧的局面。据不完全统计，在运动中涌现出先进单位二百六十三个，先进生产者、先进工作者二千六百八十一名，推广了先进经验一百七十七种，采纳了合理化建议一千多件。
      开采薄煤层
    新华社本溪30日电　本溪煤矿今年已经在薄煤层里开采出十四万吨炼焦煤，供应鞍山、本溪的钢铁工业。
    这里生产的炼焦煤是很宝贵的主焦煤。解放以前，厚度在一公尺以下的薄煤层是从来不开采的。本溪煤矿为了节约地下资源，今年增添了部分设备，开始采掘这些薄煤层。矿的领导方面还动员熟悉情况的老矿工在井下寻找薄煤层。现在已经发现的薄煤层和残采区遗留的煤炭藏量，共有六百多万吨。
    自贡发现新盐岩
    据新华社成都30日电　全国著名的井盐产地——四川自贡盐场，最近在自贡市土地坡发现蕴藏量极为丰富的新盐岩层。据初步调查，在肯定的盐岩区域内，藏量有一千三百多万吨，可以开采二十八年。
    新盐岩经过化验，它的氯化钠含量达97.4％。盐场现在正在开采的老盐岩区的盐岩氯化钠含量是95％。
    自贡盐务管理局领导人说，他们正在继续探明这个新盐岩层的面积和藏量。
