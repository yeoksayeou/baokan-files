Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 20th: Currently, it is the off-season for egg production, but purchasers in Chongqing have acquired more than 5,000 jin of eggs in the city's market in the past few days. This phenomenon of abundant supply is something Chongqing has not seen in a long time.

During the initial opening of the free market for chickens, ducks, fish, and eggs in Chongqing, prices once soared. Later, due to increased supplies and the relevant departments strengthening market management, prices gradually declined, and the market trading order returned to normal. These days, in addition to citizen purchases, there is sometimes a small surplus of goods in the market. In order to stabilize prices at a certain level and avoid affecting supply, Chongqing's commercial departments have begun to purchase the remaining goods in the market, pricing them according to quality.

Each district in Chongqing has established an exchange to guide merchants in trade. The exchange negotiates prices daily according to market conditions, ensuring that both wholesale merchants and stallholders have reasonable profits. The Chongqing municipal exchanges also send traders to various docks to receive merchants from all over, helping them find accommodation and quickly sell their goods. State-owned commercial units have designated fixed locations in the main vegetable markets in the city as farmers' trading markets.

Relevant units in Chongqing have also mobilized more than 150 stallholder activists to form enforcement groups in the 13 main vegetable markets in the central urban area. These enforcement groups assist the government in managing the market and promote policies to citizens, farmers, and merchants. After strengthening the management of the free market, speculative activities such as blocking purchases and inflating prices in the chicken, duck, fish, and egg market have been curbed.

Currently, various chicken and egg purchasing units in Chongqing are strengthening the organization of supply, sending many purchasers to various parts of Sichuan to procure goods. The supply from counties in Sichuan in December has already increased compared to November.

    成立交易所　划定交易市场　组织纠察组
    重庆自由市场开始建立正常秩序
    新华社重庆20日电　目前是鸡蛋生产的淡季，但是重庆市采购人员几天中在本市市场上收购了五千多斤鸡蛋，这种来货兴旺的现象，是重庆很久以来没有过的。
    重庆市鸡鸭鱼蛋在自由市场开放初期，价格曾一度暴涨，后来由于来货增多，有关部门加强了市场管理，价格便逐步趋向回落，市场交易秩序走上正常。这几天，除市民购买外，市场上有时还要多余少部分货品。重庆市商业部门为了使价格稳定在一定的水平，不致影响货源，已开始对市场剩下的货品，按质论价收购。
    重庆市各区都分别成立了交易所，指导商贩进行贸易。交易所每天按行情议订价格，使行商和摊贩都有合理利润。重庆市区交易所还派出交易员到各个码头接待各地来的行商，帮助他们找到住地和迅速出售货物。国营商业单位在市区各主要蔬菜市场划出固定地点作为农民交易市场。
    重庆市有关单位还在市中心区的十三个主要菜市场内发动了一百五十多个摊贩积极分子组成纠察小组。这些纠察小组一面协助政府管理市场，一面向市民、农民和商贩宣传政策。加强自由市场管理后，目前鸡鸭鱼蛋市场的拦购、抬价等投机活动已被制止。
    目前重庆市各个鸡鸭蛋品采购单位正在加强货源的组织工作，派了很多采购员到四川各地采办货物，12月四川各县来货已经比11月增多了。
