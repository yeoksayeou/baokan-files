    Exciting "Five-Mores"
    After the first year's distribution following the advanced agricultural cooperation in the Xijing Township Jianguo Agricultural Cooperative in Licheng County, Shanxi Province, the cooperative members excitedly said that their cooperative had "five-mores" this year. At first glance, one might find it strange: "Five-mores" is something people oppose, but why are they excited about it? After inquiring, it became clear that these were the "five-mores": More grain harvested - last year the actual grain production was 749,670 jin, and this year the actual harvest was 1,146,130 jin, an increase of 396,460 jin compared to last year (the more than 20,000 jin of grain produced in the cooperative members' private plots are not included in this calculation); Cooperative members receive more rations - last year each cooperative member received an average of 360 jin of rations, while this year it is 450 jin, an increase of 90 jin compared to last year; More surplus grain sold - last year 15,000 jin of grain were sold, and this year 94,000 jin of grain were sold, an increase of 79,000 jin compared to last year; More livestock feed retained - last year 59,025 jin of feed were retained, and this year 88,045 jin were retained, an increase of 29,025 jin compared to last year; More public accumulation - last year the public accumulation was 1,331 yuan, and this year it is 4,661 yuan, an increase of 3,330 yuan compared to last year. No wonder they are so excited!

    令人兴奋的“五多”
    山西黎城县西井乡建国农业社的社员们，在高级合作化后第一年的分配结束以后，都兴奋地说他们社里今年有“五多”。乍听起来，不免有点奇怪：“五多”是人们反对的，但他们为什么反而兴奋呢？经过打听，才弄清是这样的“五多”：粮食收的多——去年实产粮食七十四万九千六百七十斤，今年实收一百一十四万六千一百三十斤，比去年多收了三十九万六千四百六十斤（社员自留地中产的两万多斤粮食还未计算在内）；社员分得口粮多——去年每个社员平均分口粮三百六十斤，今年则为四百五十斤，比去年多了九十斤；卖得余粮多——去年卖粮一万五千斤，今年卖粮九万四千斤，比去年多卖七万九千斤；牲口饲料留得多——去年留饲料五万九千零二十五斤，今年留了八万八千零四十五斤，比去年多留两万九千零二十五斤；公共积累多——去年公共积累是一千三百三十一元，今年是四千六百六十一元，比去年多三千三百三十元。怪不得他们那样兴奋呢！
