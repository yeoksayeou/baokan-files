Primary School Teachers in Jiangsu Disaster Areas Persist in Teaching

(Reported by this newspaper) Primary school teachers in the disaster areas of Huai'an, Lianshui, Binhai, and other counties in Jiangsu Province are carrying forward the spirit of hard struggle and persisting in their teaching work. This semester, the number of students enrolled in these disaster areas has generally not decreased. Lianshui County has 73,495 primary school students this semester, an increase of 3,344 compared to the previous semester.

In the disaster areas, because many students have to help their families with production to survive the famine, it is impossible to gather them for classes on time. Teachers have adopted many flexible methods for teaching. For example, Wangzhuang Elementary School in Huai'an County has thirty-seven students scattered in Lizhuang, Duzhuang, and other places. The school has adopted a rotating teaching method; teachers teach in Lizhuang in the morning, and in the afternoon, they personally row a boat to Xiezhuang and bring the students to Duzhuang for class. Some students at Qianyang Elementary School often miss classes because they help their families with production. The school's teachers use the lunch break every day to tutor the students who have missed classes. Most students at Chahe Central Elementary School have to help their families with sideline production in the morning and evening, so the teachers concentrate the courses at noon.

Some primary schools also organize students to engage in sideline production within their capabilities during extracurricular activities. For example, Huji Elementary School in Lianshui County uses extracurricular activities and morning and evening time to organize students to collect wild medicinal materials such as raw pinellia, plantain seeds, and wild cockscomb flower seeds. In just a few days, they collected more than 200 kilograms. They sold the medicinal materials to the supply and marketing cooperative, helping 109 students solve the difficulty of not having money to buy books and exercise books. At the same time, because many schools have educated students about self-reliance through production, many students consciously help their families and agricultural cooperatives with cutting grass and collecting firewood.

　　江苏灾区小学教师坚持教学工作
    本报讯　江苏省淮安、涟水、滨海等县灾区的小学教师，发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，坚持教学工作。本学期这些灾区的学生入学数一般都没有减少，涟水县本学期有小学生七万三千四百九十五名，还比上学期增加了三千三百四十四名。
    在灾区，因为许多学生都得帮助家庭生产度荒，不可能按时集中上课，教师们便采用了许多灵活的方法进行教学。例如，淮安县王庄初级小学三十七名学生分散在李庄、杜庄等地，该校采用了轮回教学方法；教师上午在李庄教课，下午便亲自撑着船到谢庄，把学生带到杜庄去上课。前杨小学有些学生常因帮助家庭生产而缺课，该校教师便利用每天中饭后的休息时间为缺课学生补课。岔河中心小学大部分学生早上和晚上要帮助家里搞副业生产，教师就把课程集中在中午教。
    部分小学还在课外活动时间，组织学生进行力所能及的副业生产。例如，涟水县胡集小学利用课外活动和早晚时间，组织学生采集生半夏、车前子、野鸡冠花种子等野生药材。几天当中，他们便采集了二百多斤。他们把药材卖给供销社，帮助一百零九个学生解决了没有钱买书籍、练习簿的困难。同时，由于不少学校向学生进行生产自救的教育，很多学生就自觉地帮助家庭和农业社割草、拾柴。
