Xinhua News Agency, December 6th – The semester-end examinations for Beijing universities are approaching, and there are new changes in the examination methods and approaches this time.

Beijing universities began universally adopting oral examinations in 1953. This year, some courses have been changed to written examinations. Teachers in the Theoretical Mechanics and Materials Mechanics teaching and research groups at Tsinghua University plan to pilot written exams in several classes. After the written exam, they will grade the papers on the spot, and students whose answers are not comprehensive enough will be kept for supplementary oral exams. This can more accurately assess students' grades. Two sections of the Marxist-Leninist Research Class at the Renmin University of China plan to try "open-book exams," allowing students to bring reference books and notes during the exam. This can avoid rote memorization and better develop students' independent thinking abilities.

Various schools have researched examination methods and content. Ouyang Xiang, director of the Education Teaching and Research Group at Beijing Normal University, said that oral exams facilitate teachers in comprehensively checking students' theoretical knowledge and their proficiency in linking theory with practice. At the same time, oral exams make it easier to detect errors in students' answers than written exams, enabling teachers to promptly inspire and guide students to think. Teachers at Tsinghua University believe that some engineering professional courses involve complex technological processes, structural forms, and overall layouts. With oral exams, students can rely on drawn sketches and outlines to give more detailed explanations, which is not as restrictive as written exams. However, basic courses such as mathematics, chemistry, and physics are better suited for written exams.

　　对不同课程采取不同考试方法
　　北京各高等学校的考试方法有了改变
    据新华社6日讯　北京各高等学校一学期一度的考试已经到来，这次考试的方式方法有了新的变化。
    北京各高等学校是从1953年开始普遍采用口试的。今年，有些课程改为笔试。清华大学理论力学、材料力学两个教研组的教师准备在几个班试行笔试，笔试后当场批阅试卷，把试题答得不够充分的学生留下来，补行口试，这样可以比较精确地评定学生的成绩。中国人民大学马克思列宁主义研究班的两个分班准备试用“开卷考试”，允许学生在考试时携带参考书和笔记。这样可以避免背诵条文，也能够更好地发挥学生的独立思考能力。
    各校对于考试的方法和内容都作了研究。北京师范大学教育学教研组主任欧阳湘说，口试便于教师比较全面地检查学生的理论知识和理论联系实际的熟练程度。同时，口试也比笔试容易发现学生答题中的正误，使教师能及时地启发和引导学生思考。清华大学教师认为，有些工科性专业课内容牵涉到繁复的工艺过程、结构形式以及总体布置等问题，用口试的方法，学生就可以依靠画好的草图和提纲来作比较详细的解释，不像笔试那么受限制；而数学、化学、物理等基础课，则以笔试较好。
