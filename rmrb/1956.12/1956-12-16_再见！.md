    Goodbye!
    Li Wukui
    When I came, this place was waist-high weeds,
    Bold wild rabbits darted by my side;
    To buy a pack of cigarettes, I had to run two *li*,
    At night, crows and magpies chattered and squawked.
    We shoveled earth and laid bricks to build factories,
    Magnificent chimneys soared into the clouds.
    Sparkling blue machines took their places,
    And mechanical worker brothers reported for duty.
    "Goodbye! Waiting to hear the good news of your meritorious service!"
    I stride with "onward march" steps, to build new factories.

    再见！
    李武魁
    来时这片是没腰的荒草，
    大胆的野兔从身边窜跑；
    买包烟卷儿得跑二里路，
    下晚鸦雀唧咔唧咔乱叫。
    铲土砌砖盖起了厂房，
    雄伟的烟囱插入云霄。
    蓝晶晶的机器入了座，
    机械工人大哥也报了到。
    “再见！等着听你的立功喜报！”
    我踏着“出征”的步子，去把新的厂房建造。
