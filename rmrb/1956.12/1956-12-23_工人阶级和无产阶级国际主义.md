    The Working Class and Proletarian Internationalism
    Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party
    Judging from recent international events, the working people of all countries can see more and more clearly that the pressing issue at present is that we must not depart from the principles of Marxism-Leninism and must be resolutely loyal to proletarian internationalism.
    In the face of international forces—capitalism—which use all sorts of countless methods to spread their influence in the ideological and other fields, the fighting solidarity of the working people of all countries should be confirmed in any environment and should be expressed in the specific forms required by the situation.
    Our enemies spread rumors and slanders, attempting to provoke contradictions between proletarian internationalism and working-class patriotism. Lenin's doctrine points out in this situation that without love for one's own people, proletarian internationalism is unimaginable; similarly, without internationalism and without the fighting solidarity with workers of all countries, patriotism is also unimaginable.
    The battle cry "Workers of all countries, unite!" put forward by Marx and Engels in their immortal "Communist Manifesto" will always have its practical significance. This battle cry reminds the proletarians of all countries that in the process of their struggle against the capitalists, they cannot indifferently treat the transformation of class struggles in other countries, because the success or failure of the working class in any country will inevitably bring good or bad consequences to the entire international workers' movement.
    The glorious Paris Commune set a brilliant example of proletarian internationalism, which is closely linked to the profound national character of the policies implemented by the members of the Paris Commune.
    In the face of a government which, as Marx said, had become a "government of national betrayal," the Commune's fighters defended the true national interests which are closely related to the interests of the working class, because the victory of Paris over the aggressors was the victory of the French workers over the French capitalists.
    Since the members of the Paris Commune were enthusiastic patriots, they were also internationalists. Their struggle inspired the working people and democrats of all countries. It is for this reason that representatives of Russians, Poles, Italians, Austrians, Americans, and other nationalities participated in the ranks of fighting for the Commune.
    The Hungarian Frankel was one of the outstanding political leaders of the Paris Commune; the Pole Jarosław Dąbrowski commanded the Commune's army and died defending the barricades; the Russian female revolutionary Ye. Dmitriyeva played a significant political role, leading a women's battalion to fight the Versailles troops entering Paris.
    The cause of the Paris Commune is also the cause of the international socialist movement that unites the most conscious proletarians. The German socialist August Bebel expressed this international solidarity when he publicly said in the German Imperial Parliament on May 25, 1871:
    "Believe me, every proletarian in Europe and everyone who still has a sense of freedom and independence is focusing their eyes on Paris. Although Paris has now been suppressed, I remind you that the struggle in Paris is only a small skirmish, and the major events in Europe are still to come..."
    Bebel took a class stand in this way, thereby avoiding the danger of a worker violating the interests of socialism and democracy by considering political unity with the domestic bourgeoisie to be above the indivisible unity of the proletarians of all countries.
    International reactionary forces have widely used the Hungarian events in their struggle against the working class in order to instigate a frenzied attack on the Soviet Union and the Communist Parties of all countries.
    The French reactionaries have been completely exposed in this matter, and they have also received the help of the leaders of the Socialist Party, who have found an excuse in the Hungarian events to divert people's attention from the Algerian War, the aggression against Egypt, and the serious consequences of this policy for the masses.
    When the Russian Revolution of 1905 broke out, the international proletariat expressed its solidarity with the Russian working people. On January 24, 1905, the Seine Provincial Federation of Trade Unions wrote to the Russian working people: "The workers of Paris, the city of revolution, are with you wholeheartedly. We declare: You can count on us, we will help you! Down with the Tsar! Down with the exploiters! Long live the social revolution!"
    The next day, the great socialist propagandist Jean Jaurès wrote: "It is perfectly just and perfectly natural that French workers are so enthusiastically and sympathetically united with Russian workers."
    A few days later, on March 4, 1905, the famous writer Anatole France, who was full of socialist ideas and joined the French Communist Party in his later years, wrote: "Our fathers taught the European bourgeoisie revolution, and now the Russian proletariat has given us a lesson in social revolution." At the end of 1905, when the large-scale proletarian revolutionary movement and the large-scale peasant movement under the influence of the proletarian struggle were developing in Russia, and when the mutiny broke out on the armored ship "Potemkin," Anatole France said at a mass meeting organized by the Association of Friends of the Russian People: "Now, along the Neva, the Vistula, and the Volga, the fate of a new Europe and the future of mankind is being decided."
    Twelve years later, the victorious October Socialist Revolution of 1917, led by Lenin's party, truly changed the course of human history and ended the situation in which capitalism ruled the entire world.
    The victory of the October Socialist Revolution internationally led to a rampant offensive of rumors and slanders, the purpose of which was to deceive the people of all countries and attempt to incite them against the Russian working people who had taken up the banner that had fallen from the hands of the martyrs of the Paris Commune.
    However, the working people of the world stood firm on their position and expressed their support for the young Soviet Republic born out of the October Revolution. The soldiers of various capitalist countries who were sent to Russia to interfere with the Soviet regime also revolted one after another. With this action, they showed their imperialist governments that they must be loyal to the vocation of their class.
    The international proletariat rightly believed that the October Socialist Revolution was their own victory, the first step towards the victory of socialism in the world, and the proletariat thus showed that they fully affirmed the aspect of fighting for the interests of their class.
    This is why, whenever the imperialists threatened the country of the October Revolution, the working people expressed international solidarity with new strength. The proletarian internationalism expressed in this form has repeatedly made it clear that the working people of all countries believe that any loss suffered by the Soviet regime is a serious harm to themselves.
    The nature of the events that occurred on the eve of World War II determined that the proletariat of all countries must be loyal to proletarian internationalism.
    As everyone knows, in order to deal with the victory won by the Spanish People's Front in 1936, the Spanish fascists headed by Franco, with the support of Hitler and Mussolini, began an armed invasion of the Spanish Republic.
    During this period, the question in Spain was: either Hitlerites and Italian fascists become the masters of Spain, or they suffer defeat.
    The working class around the world, having learned from the German events and opposing fascism, explains why the working people of all countries have come to Spain to fight fascism.
    Those who do not retreat in the face of danger and demand to fight are also correct. They are unwilling to be bystanders of historical events. They know that Hitler and Mussolini's victory in Spain will be a signal for the fascists to invade other European countries.
    The international brigade volunteers went to Spain to fight, thus proving that their political foresight was far superior to that of the rulers, who, under the guise of the deceptive formula of "non-intervention," actually acted as accomplices of the fascists.
    No one can deny that, for example, if the French government had helped the Spanish Republic at that time, it would have won victory, and the course of European events would have been different. In such a case, it would have been difficult for Hitler to launch a war in 1939, and naturally there would have been no shameful Munich surrender.
    Among those who are attacking the stationing of Soviet troops in Hungary today, some are merely trying to defend their positions, just like those who advocated non-intervention in Spain twenty years ago. They rashly or shamelessly forgot that the policy of non-intervention in Spain had been the starting point for launching a war that cost tens of millions of lives, and non-intervention in Hungary could similarly become the starting point for the imperialists to launch terrible new adventures.
    In World War II, the Soviet army shed blood to oppose Hitler's rule. The Soviet army liberated many countries, including Hungary, from the inhumane clutches of the fascists and fulfilled its class obligations. It acted in accordance with the principles of proletarian internationalism.
    When concessions were made repeatedly, the Imre Nagy government simply went down the road of a fascist reactionary regime, and the situation in Hungary was already very difficult when the working people and Hungarian patriots established the worker-peasant revolutionary government.
    Should the enemies be allowed to eliminate the communists and working people loyal to the cause of socialism? Should the counter-revolutionaries be allowed to continue the situation in which they carried out terror and slaughter when the Austro-Hungarian border was opened to agitators and mercenaries pouring into Hungary?
    As the "People's Daily" (the organ of the Chinese Communist Party) justly asserted: "The Soviet Union's position on the Hungarian events is entirely a just position of proletarian internationalism."
    It should be taken into account what consequences would result if fascism were to triumph in Hungary. Encouraged by this victory, fascism would begin to attack everywhere, and we would be faced with the kind of comprehensive and increasingly rampant fascist attacks that occurred in France on November 7 (this year). (On November 7th this year, anti-communist rioters burned down the central office of the French Communist Party in Paris, smashed the "Humanité" and "Liberation" newspaper offices, and attacked the French Communist Party buildings in other cities - editor's note)
    At that time, the fascist danger on an international scale would become rampant, and the heart of Europe might become a source of war.
    In addition, it should also be pointed out that it is precisely those in France who are doing everything possible to revive German militarism who are now completely disappointed to see the defeat of the Hungarian fascist bandits. They had planned that as long as the Hungarian events developed smoothly, the newly armed forces of West Germany could show off their skills.
    The French Communists are aware that in this situation, they are both proletarians who are loyal to proletarian internationalism and patriots who protect the national interests that are inseparable from defending peace. They expressed their approval of the Soviet army's assistance to Hungary at the request of the Hungarian government.
    In addition, we believe that if the Soviet army had not provided (Hungary) with assistance and fascism had triumphed (although this cannot be assumed), then some of those who are now criticizing the Soviet Union would not miss the opportunity to accuse the Soviet Union of standing idly by.
    If the Hungarian Working People's Party had not made serious mistakes or the mistakes had been corrected in time, if the communists had not been divided and could have been firmly united on the basis of the principles of Marxism-Leninism and led the masses, and if it had been possible to maintain a high degree of vigilance at that time - because there is no doubt that the enemy was already active and it could be expected that they would continue to be active - then it would have been possible to avoid the kind of situation that arose in Hungary.
    The situation requires the working people of all countries to pay unremitting attention to the development of the international situation, not to retreat in the face of the ideological offensive of the class enemies, and to prove that they are full of a sense of responsibility and deeply understand their responsibilities for international proletarian solidarity.
    The French reactionaries, who sponsor the policies implemented by the leaders of the Socialist Party that are not in line with the true interests of France, are eager to use the Hungarian events as an excuse to generally lead the French working people to oppose the Communist Party and the Soviet Union.
    The French working class and democrats see the gang of fascist arsonists and murderers who have begun to act, and they understand more clearly what happened in Hungary.
    The French working people, surrounded by rumors and intimidation, understand that defending the national interests of France is also defending the interests of their class, and they constantly expose the fascist propaganda about the Hungarian events.
    They know how much effort the Soviet army spent to save the people from the ravages of Hitler, and they also know what it means for the interests of the people of all countries to suppress fascism in Hungary.
    Moreover, nothing can change or force people to forget the fact that, thanks to the help of the Soviet army (in the situation where the counter-revolution in Hungary began to attack, this help was a concrete manifestation of proletarian internationalism), victory still belongs to the forces of peace and socialism.
    As for the French Communist Party, it will gloriously fulfill its obligations to the international workers' movement.
    The Communist Party represents the national interests of its own people, and it should take into account national characteristics and the conditions of each country when deciding on policies. However, it must never forget the necessity of ideological unity of Marxist-Leninist parties because of this.
    The current situation especially requires this and demands it even more strongly, because we see what kind of offensive the reactionary forces headed by the US imperialists and international fascism are launching against world peace and socialist forces.
    It is impossible to seriously judge the Hungarian events without starting from these basic facts. For this reason, all kinds of political actions and attitudes that may weaken the solidarity of the international workers' movement and the communist movement, as well as socialist countries, should be considered harmful and rejected.
    In this regard, our party believes that it must be pointed out that Comrade Tito's use of the Yugoslav path as a model for other countries has drawn a line between the Communist Parties of various countries, which not only cannot promote the solidarity of the international communist movement, but also becomes a factor of separation.
    It is impossible to justify this position by arguing that there are various forms of transition to socialism. This diversity cannot in the slightest degree erase the general essence of the dictatorship of the proletariat that was exemplified by the country of the October Socialist Revolution.
    As Comrade Maurice Thorez pointed out, the French Communist Party, in matters related to it, will carefully study the glorious experience of Lenin's party, which inspires the workers' revolutionary parties around the world. We believe that if the international workers' movement has several centers, there is a danger of splitting this movement. The great Soviet Communist Party was the first workers' party to seize power and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. This party has accumulated rich experience both in defending the Soviet regime and resisting enemies, and in the magnificent achievements of building socialism. This party leads a vast country and is advancing along the road of gradually building communism.
    All of this is a political reality, and the communist parties and revolutionary workers of all countries who are striving to advance toward socialism along their own path cannot ignore this reality. Loyalty to the principles of Leninism and the study of the rich experience of Lenin's party are the decisive factors for the unity of the international workers' movement and the achievement of new victories.

    工人阶级和无产阶级国际主义
    法国共产党中央委员会书记　雅克·杜克洛
    从最近发生的国际事件来看，各国劳动人民可以越来越明显地看到，目前的迫切问题在于必须不离开马克思列宁主义的原则和坚决忠实于无产阶级国际主义。
    在用形形色色不计其数的办法来在思想领域里和其他领域里散播影响的国际力量——资本主义的面前，各国劳动人民的战斗团结应当在任何环境下都得到证实，并且应当用形势所要求的具体形式表现出来。
    我们的敌人造谣中伤，企图在无产阶级国际主义和工人阶级爱国主义之间挑起矛盾，列宁的学说就这种情况指出，不热爱本国人民，无产阶级国际主义是不可想像的，同样，没有国际主义、没有同世界各国工人的战斗团结，爱国主义也是不可想像的。
    马克思和恩格斯在他们不朽的“共产党宣言”中提出的战斗口号“全世界无产者，联合起来！”永远都具有它的现实意义。这个战斗口号提醒各个国家的无产者：他们在反对资本家的斗争过程中，不能漠不关心地对待其他国家阶级斗争的转变，因为工人阶级在任何国家的成败势必会给整个国际工人运动带来好的或者是坏的后果。
    光荣的巴黎公社给无产阶级国际主义树立了光辉的榜样，这种国际主义同巴黎公社社员所实行的政策的深刻的民族性有着紧密的联系。
    在一个像马克思所说的那样已经变成“民族叛变的政府”面前，公社的战士维护了同工人阶级利益息息相关的真正的民族利益，因为巴黎对侵略者的胜利就是法国工人对法国资本家的胜利。
    巴黎公社的社员既然是热诚的爱国主义者，他们同时也就是国际主义者。他们的斗争鼓舞了各国劳动人民和民主主义者。正是由于这个原因，俄罗斯人、波兰人、意大利人、奥地利人、美国人和其他各民族的代表都参加了为公社而斗争的行列。
    匈牙利人弗兰克利是巴黎公社的杰出的政治领导人之一；波兰人雅罗斯瓦夫·董布罗夫斯基曾指挥过公社的军队并且牺牲在防塞里；俄国女革命家叶·德米特里耶娃起了重大的政治作用，她曾经率领妇女营同进入巴黎的凡尔赛人斗争。
    巴黎公社的事业也就是团结最有觉悟的无产者的国际社会主义运动的事业。德国社会主义者奥古斯特·倍倍尔表达了这种国际团结，他在1871年5月25日在德意志帝国国会中公开说：
  “请相信吧，欧洲的每一个无产者和每一个还有自由和独立感的人，都把自己的视线投向巴黎。虽然现在巴黎已被镇压下去了，但是我提醒你们，巴黎斗争只不过是一次不大的前哨战，欧洲的主要事件还在后面……”
    倍倍尔这样采取了阶级立场，从而避免了以下的这种危险：一个工人由于认为同本国资产阶级的政治团结高于各国无产阶级不可分割的团结，就会违反社会主义利益和民主利益。
    国际反动势力在反对工人阶级的斗争中广泛地利用了匈牙利事件，以便策动一次对苏联和各国共产党的疯狂进攻。
    法国反动派在这件事上丑态毕露，他们还得到了社会党领导人的帮助，社会党的领导者在匈牙利事件中找到了借口来转移人民对阿尔及利亚战争、对侵略埃及和这种政策给人民群众造成的严重后果的注意。
    1905年俄国革命爆发的时候，国际无产阶级就表现了对俄国劳动人民的声援。1905年1月24日塞纳省工会联合会写信给俄国劳动人民说：“巴黎这个革命之城的劳动者们全心全意地同你们在一起，我们宣布：你们可以指望我们，我们将帮助你们！打倒沙皇！打倒剥削者！社会革命万岁！”
    第二天，伟大的社会主义宣扬者让·若雷斯写道：“法国工人如此热烈和同情地同俄国工人团结在一起，这是完全正义的，是完全自然的。”
    过了一些日子，在1905年3月4日，充满着社会主义思想并且在晚年加入了法国共产党的著名作家安纳托耳·弗朗斯写道：“我们的父辈教会了欧洲资产阶级革命，而现在，俄国的无产阶级给我们上了社会革命的一课。”1905年末，即当大规模的无产阶级革命运动以及在无产阶级斗争影响下的大规模的农民运动在俄国发展起来的时候，在“波将金”号装甲舰上爆发了起义的时候，安纳托耳·弗朗斯在俄国人民之友协会所组织的群众大会上说：“现在，在?瓦河、维斯杜拉河和伏尔加河沿岸，决定着新的欧洲和未来人类的命运。”
    经过十二年，由列宁的党领导而获胜的1917年十月社会主义革命真正地改变了人类历史的进程，并结束了资本主义统治整个世界的局面。
    1917年十月社会主义革命的胜利在国际上招致了猖狂的谣言和诬蔑攻势，这种攻势的目的是欺骗各国人民，企图煽动他们来反对已经把从巴黎公社烈士们的手中落下来了的旗帜拿到自己手里的俄国劳动人民。
    但是，世界各国的劳动人民都站稳了自己的立场，表示声援十月革命中所诞生的年青的苏维埃共和国。被派到俄国去干涉苏维埃政权的各个资本主义国家的士兵们也纷纷起义，他们以这种行动向自己的帝国主义政府表明了，他们一定要忠实于本阶级的天职。
    国际无产阶级公正地认为，十月社会主义革命是他们自己的胜利，是社会主义在全世界胜利的第一步，无产阶级这样就表明了他们完全肯定争取本阶级的利益这一方面。
    这就是为什么每当帝国主义者威胁（实行）十月革命的国家的时候，劳动人们都以新的力量表示国际声援的原因。用这种形式表现出来的无产阶级国际主义一再清楚地表明：各国劳动人们都认为，苏维埃政权遭到的任何损失都是对他们自己的严重危害。
    在第二次世界大战的前夕所发生的事件本身的性质决定了所有国家的无产阶级必须忠实于无产阶级国际主义。
    大家知道，为了对付西班牙人民阵线在1936年所获得的胜利，以佛朗哥为首的西班牙法西斯分子在希特勒和墨索里尼的支持下开始了对西班牙共和国的武装侵略。
    在这个时期西班牙的问题就是：或是希特勒分子和意大利法西斯分子成为西班牙的主人，或是他们遭受失败。
    从德国事件中取得了经验的全世界工人阶级都反对法西斯主义，这也就说明了为什么各国劳动人民纷纷来到西班牙同法西斯主义作战。
    在危险面前不退却并且要求战斗的人也是正确的，他们不愿意作为历史事件的袖手旁观者。他们知道，希特勒和墨索里尼在西班牙的胜利将是法西斯分子侵犯欧洲其他国家的信号。
    国际纵队志愿军到西班牙去作战，从而证明了他们在政治上的远见是远非执政者所能与之相比的，执政者在骗人的“不干涉”公式的掩饰下，实际上充当了法西斯分子的走卒。
    谁都不能否认，比如，法国政府当时如果帮助西班牙共和国的话，那末，它是会得到胜利的，而且欧洲事件的进程也会有所不同。在这样的情况下，希特勒就很难在1939年发动战争，自然也就不会有可耻的慕尼黑投降。
    在今天抨击苏军驻留匈牙利的那些人中间，有些人不过是也想同二十年前主张不干涉西班牙的那些人一样为自己的立场辩护，他们轻率地或者是无耻地忘掉了：不干涉西班牙的政策曾经是发动使数千万人丧失生命的战争的起点，而不干涉匈牙利同样也可能成为帝国主义者发动可怕的新冒险的起点。
    在第二次世界大战中，苏联军队为了反对希特勒统治而流过血，苏联军队从法西斯分子惨无人道的魔掌中解放了包括匈牙利在内的许多国家，履行了自己的阶级义务。它是按照无产阶级国际主义的原则行事的。
    当一再让步的时候，伊姆雷·纳吉政府索性向法西斯反动势力政权的道路上走去，而当劳动人民和匈牙利爱国主义者建立了工农革命政府的时候，匈牙利的局势已经是非常困难的了。
    难道应该容许敌人消灭忠于社会主义事业的共产党人和劳动人民吗？难道当奥匈边界对涌入匈牙利的煽动者和雇佣者敞开大门的时候，应该让反革命有可能继续保持那种他们借以进行恐怖和残杀的局面吗？
    正如“人民日报”（中国共产党机关报）所作的公正论断那样：“苏联在对匈牙利事件中的立场完全是无产阶级国际主义的正义立场”。
    应当考虑到，如果法西斯主义在匈牙利获得胜利，它将带来怎样的后果。为这个胜利所鼓动的法西斯主义就会在各处开始进攻，而我们便会面临着像在（今年）11月7日法国所发生的那种全面的越来越猖狂的法西斯进攻。（今年11月7日反共暴徒焚烧了巴黎法共中央办公处、捣毁了“人道报”和“解放报”报馆，并且袭击了法国其他城市中的法共建筑物——编者注）
    那时国际范围的法西斯危险便会猖狂起来，而欧洲的心脏就有可能成为战争的策源地。
    此外，还应当指出，正是法国那些竭尽一切力量复活德国军国主义的人，现在看到匈牙利法西斯匪徒的失败而感到完全失望。他们本来计划，只要匈牙利事件顺利地发展，西德的新武装力量便可一显身手。
    法国共产党人意识到，在这种情况下，他们既是忠实于无产阶级国际主义的无产者，又是保护同保卫和平不可分割的民族利益的爱国者。他们表示赞同苏联军队应匈牙利政府的请求给匈牙利的援助。
    另外，我们相信，如果苏联军队不给予（匈牙利）帮助而法西斯主义取得了胜利（虽然不能这样假设），那么，某些现在非难苏联的人便会不放过机会来责备苏联袖手旁观了。
    如果匈牙利劳动人民党没有犯严重的错误或者错误得到了及时的纠正，如果共产党人没有分裂，而且能够牢固地团结在马克思列宁主义的原则的基础上以及领导起群众来，并且，如果当时有可能保持高度警惕——因为毫无疑问，敌人当时已经在进行活动，并且可以预料到他们将继续进行活动——，那末，就可以避免产生匈牙利事件的那种局势。
    形势要求各国劳动人民不懈地注意国际形势的发展，不在阶级敌人的思想进攻前面退却，以及证明他们充满着责任感并且深刻地体会到自己对国际无产阶级团结的职责。
    那些赞助社会党领导人所实行的不符合法国真正利益的政策的法国反动派很想用匈牙利事件作为借口来引导法国劳动人民普遍地反对共产党和苏联。
    法国工人阶级和民主主义者看到开始行动的法西斯纵火者和凶手这一帮匪徒，就更清楚地了解了匈牙利所发生的一切。
    谣言和恐吓所包围的法国劳动人民懂得，他们保卫法国的民族利益也就是保卫本阶级的利益，他们不断地揭露法西斯分子关于匈牙利事件的宣传。
    他们知道，苏联军队花了多么大的力量来拯救人民使他们免遭希特勒的残害，他们也知道，镇压匈牙利的法西斯主义对于各国人民的利益有怎样的意义。
    而且，什么也不能改变或者强使人们忘记这样一个事实：由于苏军的帮助（在匈牙利反革命开始进攻的情况下，这种帮助是无产阶级国际主义的具体表现），胜利仍然属于和平和社会主义力量。
    至于法国共产党，它将光荣地执行自己对国际工人运动的义务。
    共产党代表本国人民的民族利益，它在决定政策的时候，应当考虑到民族特点和各个国家的条件。但是，决不能因此而忘掉了马克思列宁主义政党在观念形态上团结一致的必要性。
    当前局势特别需要，并且更加强烈地要求这样做，因为我们看到，以美帝国主义者为首的反动势力和国际法西斯主义正在向世界和平和社会主义力量发动怎样的进攻。
    要是不从这些基本情况出发，就无法认真地判断匈牙利事件。正因为这样，凡是可能削弱国际工人运动和共产主义运动以及社会主义国家的团结的各种政治行动和各种态度，都应当被认为是有害的而加以拒绝。
    在这方面，我们党认为必须指出，铁托同志把南斯拉夫的道路作为其他国家的楷模，在各国共产党之间划了一道界线，这不但不能促进国际共产主义运动的团结，反而成为分离的因素。
    想用过渡到社会主义有各种各样的形式这种论点来为这种立场辩护是不可能的。这种多样性丝毫也不能抹煞十月社会主义革命的国家所树立榜样的无产阶级专政的一般实质。
    正如莫里斯·多列士同志所指出，法国共产党在同它有关的事情上，将仔细地研究鼓舞着全世界工人革命政党的列宁的党的光荣经验。我们认为，要是国际工人运动有几个中心，就有使这个运动陷于分裂的危险。伟大的苏联共产党是取得了政权和建立了无产阶级专政的第一个工人党。这个党无论在保卫苏维埃政权和反抗敌人方面，或是在建设社会主义的宏伟成就方面，都积累了丰富的经验。这个党领导着一个地大物博的国家，正在沿着逐步建设共产主义的道路前进。
    这一切都是政治上的现实，为按照自己的道路向社会主义前进而奋斗的各国共产党人和革命工人都不能忽略这种现实。忠于列宁主义的原则和研究列宁的党的丰富经验是国际工人运动团结一致和取得新的胜利的决定性因素。
