Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 4th: According to a TASS report from Warsaw: The Polish "People's Tribune" published an article on December 3rd concerning Polish foreign policy, emphasizing that, now and in the future, Poland's foreign policy is consistent with the Soviet Union on major issues, because we have formed an alliance with the Soviet state. The premise for this alliance exists because the fundamental national and class interests of our two socialist countries are the same.

The article's author, Wojcik, wrote that, in the eyes of the Polish people, the foundation of our foreign policy—the Polish-Soviet alliance—has stood the test, and it has proven that this alliance is necessary for issues fundamental to our national interests. These fundamental issues are: defending Poland from the threat of a resurgent German militarism; preventing any infringement upon the Oder-Neisse border; and preventing any attempts to transform Poland into a thoroughfare for eastward aggression, built upon the suffering of the Polish people.

The author pointed out that, not only abroad, but also within our country, there exists a force attempting to undermine or even abolish the Polish-Soviet alliance. As a first step, this force might demand that Poland be "best neutral." As a second step, they would transform Poland into an anti-Soviet base, thereby making the Polish people pay a heavy price once again for the resulting consequences.

The author wrote that, precisely because we have formed an alliance with the Soviet Union on the principles of equality and respect for sovereignty, and precisely because we are situated within the socialist family that includes the world's second-largest socialist power—People's China—Poland truly has the possibility of victoriously defending its own national interests and protecting its territory from military aggression. If Poland were not a socialist country, if it had not formed an alliance with the Soviet Union and received the support of other socialist countries, then it would be impossible to implement this policy.

　  波兰“人民论坛报”载文论外交政策
　　波苏联盟符合波兰民族利益
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社华沙消息：波兰“人民论坛报”3日发表的一篇论波兰外交政策的文章强调指出，在现在和将来，波兰的外交政策在主要问题上都是同苏联一致的，因为我们同苏维埃国家结成联盟，这个联盟的前提之所以存在是因为我们两个社会主义国家的基本民族利益和基本阶级利益是相同的。
    文章作者沃伊戚次斯基写道，在波兰人民看来，我们外交政策的基础——波苏联盟通过了考验，它并且证明，这种联盟对于关系我们民族利益的基本问题来说是必要的，这些基本问题就是：保卫波兰使它不受正在复活的德国军国主义的侵害，防止对奥得河—尼斯河国界线的任何侵犯，防止一切想把波兰变成为一条建立在波兰人民的痛苦之上的向东方进军的便道的企图。
    作者指出，不但在外国，而且在我们国内也存在着一种企图破坏、甚至取消波苏联盟的势力。第一步，这种势力可能会要求让波兰“最好中立”，第二步，他们就要把波兰变成反苏的基地，从而使波兰人民为之再一次付出代价很大的种种后果。
    作者写道，正因为我们在平等和尊重主权的原则基础上同苏联结成联盟，正因为我们处身于有世界第二个社会主义大国——人民中国在内的社会主义大家庭中，波兰才真正有可能来执行胜利地保卫自己民族利益、保卫自己领土免遭军事侵犯的政策。如果波兰不是社会主义国家，如果它没有同苏联结成联盟和得到其他社会主义国家的支持，那么它就不可能执行这一政策。
