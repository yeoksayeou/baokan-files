    Why Not Use Local Materials?

    Yuexi County is extremely rich in forest resources, with reserves of approximately 1.8 million cubic meters. For a long time, due to inconvenient transportation, the trees here have grown and died on their own, left to rot. After the establishment of the Ministry of Forestry, this area was placed under the management of the Huoshan Forestry Bureau. However, until now, no one has sought a way out for the timber in this area.

    The Huai River Management Committee is building a reservoir at Mozi Tan. Farmers believe that this will solve the problem of timber sales. The forest area is only fifty to sixty li from the construction site. Using the timber from this area to support the reservoir construction would not only save the state 1.5 million yuan, but also ensure the timely supply of materials. If a highway were built here, the engineering cost would only be 600,000 yuan, which would still save more than 900,000 yuan. However, the Huoshan Forestry Bureau not only does not come to purchase the timber itself, but also prohibits forest farmers from selling it to the construction site, making it impossible for the forest farmers to maintain their livelihoods. We have reported these situations to the Forestry Bureau many times, but they have not been resolved. It is right for the timber to be uniformly harvested and managed by the forestry department, but the practice of the Huoshan Forestry Bureau is unreasonable.

    为什么不就地取材
    岳西县的森林资源极为丰富，储藏量约为一百八十多万立方米。长期来，由于交通不便，这里的树木都是自生自灭，任其腐烂。森林工业部成立后，将这个地区划归霍山森林工业局管理，可是直到现在仍没有人为这个地方的木材找寻出路。
    治淮委员会在磨子潭修建水库，农民们认为这一下木材销路可以解决了。林区距工地仅五十至六十华里，用这儿的木材支援水库建设不但可为国家节约一百五十万元，且能保证材料供应及时。若在这里修一条公路，工程费也仅只要六十万元，尚可节约九十多万元。但霍山森林工业局不但自己不来采购，同时也不许林农向工地出售，弄得林农生活无法维持。这些情况，我们曾多次向森林工业局反映，至今没有解决。木材由森林工业部门统一采伐管理是应该的，但像霍山森林工业局这种作法是不符合情理的。
