    Only Because It's Not Their Own Money
    Gao Zhi
    In recent years, some institutions and enterprises have been rushing to spend money at the end of each year. There has been criticism every year, but this extravagant trend has not stopped.
    Rushing to spend money – this strange phenomenon is astonishingly bizarre. Spending money even has competitions; not spending money is considered not actively working. No wonder they try every possible means to spend money, no wonder a unit's purchasing personnel spend 10,000 yuan on travel and telegram expenses.
    There are two types of rushed spending. The first is rushing to spend money to deal with superiors, a very shameful manifestation of departmentalism. When superiors review and approve subordinates' budgets, they uniformly reduce them by several tens of percent. If subordinates hand in the "budget surplus funds" of the current year, the next year's budget will not be fully approved, and subordinate units will experience difficulties. Why not treat superiors realistically? Using the method of spending money recklessly to fight for next year's budget, what kind of method is this? Isn't this like a self-inflicted injury at the expense of the state?
    The second type is spending money for the sake of spending money, or spending all the money obtained from superiors by using the "more budget creation" method. This is a case of compounding mistakes, or squandering all the money saved in a year in one go, making the savings efforts fall short. This kind of spending can be described as "heartless" "reckless spending."
    What good does their reckless spending do for the country? What good does it do for the people? No matter how those who recklessly spend money try to find objective reasons, they can't say that reckless spending is not reckless spending.
    Some subordinate organs and enterprises act as if they cannot complete their tasks unless they get more money from their superiors and the state. Therefore, they compete for budgets, supplemental funds, temporary expenses, and special expenses, even shouting themselves hoarse and turning red in the face in meetings, speaking in tense tones and with firm determination on the phone, and finding reasons and excuses everywhere in reports, all to get money.
    Once they get the money in their hands, they spend it without a plan, rushing to spend it at the end of the year, squandering it lavishly. They will also say, "more, faster, better, and more economical," but when the end of the year comes, they seem to be reciting a text, forgetting one part as they recite another, only remembering to be "more" and "faster" in rushing to spend money, forgetting "better" and "more economical." Didn't some departments notify their subordinate units how to "spend money" as early as September? Weren't some people rushing to buy electric fans when the stoves were just being lit and everyone was studying the documents of the Eighth National Congress?
    How do those who squander money spend their own money? When using their own money, they are meticulous and never spend recklessly, even regarding a single penny as precious as life. May I ask, have they donated winter clothes to support the disaster-stricken peasant brothers? Are they willing to buy ten or twenty yuan more in government bonds? Are they willing to use their own envelopes and stationery to reply to letters from old comrades-in-arms? Are they willing to spend a streetcar fare to visit a friend's illness? Why do they regard their own money as precious as life, but treat the state's money like dirt? Why are they not as generous in spending their own money as they are in spending the state's money?
    If these experts in rushing to spend money regarded the state's money as they regard their own, they would regard the state's money as precious as life; if they used the state's money as they use their own, they would not squander the state's money lavishly.
    If they asked their superiors for money as they hope to increase their own wages, then we also hope that they spend money as they spend their own wages.

    只因不是自家钱
    高植
    几年来，每到年终，便有一些机关、企业突击花钱，每年也有批评，但是这种挥金如土的风气并未停止。
    突击花钱——这个怪现象怪得惊人离奇。花钱居然也有比赛，不会花钱就是工作不积极。无怪他们千方百计地花钱，无怪一个单位的采购人员的旅费和电报费一用就是一万元了。
    突击花钱有两种。第一种是对付上级的突击花钱，是一种极其可耻的本位主义的作祟。上级在审核批准下级预算的时候，一律削减百分之几十，下级若是上缴了本年的“预算结余资金”，则下年的预算就得不到如数批准，下级单位就会发生困难。为什么不实事求是地对待上级呢？用乱花钱的办法争取下年的预算，这叫什么办法呢？这不是好像慷国家之慨的苦肉计吗？
    第二种是为花钱而花钱，或是把用“多造预算”的方法向上级要来的钱统统花光，是一种将错就错，或是把一年节约下来的钱作一次尽兴的挥霍，使节约功亏一篑。这种花钱可以说是“黑了良心”的“乱花钱”。
    他们这么乱花钱，对国家有什么好处？对人民有什么好处？不管乱花钱的人怎样去找客观原因，总不能把乱花钱说成不是乱花钱。
    有些下级机关、企业，向上级、向国家要钱的时候，仿佛不多给钱，就完不成任务。因此他们争预算、争追加、争临时费、争特别费，甚至在会议上，声嘶力竭、面红耳赤，在电话里，口气紧张，意志坚决，在报告里，东找理由，西找借口，一味要钱。
    一旦要钱到他们手里，就无计划地花钱，到了年终，突击花钱，挥金如土了。他们也会说，又多、又快、又好、又省，但是一到年终，他们就好像学生背书似地，背了这句，忘记那句，只记得在突击花钱上又多又快，忘记又好又省了。不是有的部门在9月里就通知所属单位怎样“花钱”了吗？不是炉子刚刚升火，大家在学习八大文件的时候，就有人抢购电扇了吗？
    那些挥金如土的人，又是怎样地花自家的钱呢？在用自家的钱的时候，他们精打细算，决不乱花，甚至一钱如命。请问，他们捐过寒衣支援灾区农民弟兄吗？他们肯多买十元、二十元公债吗？他们肯用自家的信封信纸回老战友的信吗？他们肯花一次电车费去看朋友的病吗？为什么他们看自家的钱像命一样，看国家的钱像土一样呢？为什么他们花自家的钱不像花国家的钱那么慷慨呢？
    这些突击花钱的能手，要是看国家的钱像看自家的钱一样，就会看国家的钱一钱如命了；要是用国家的钱像用自家的钱一样，就不会用国家的钱挥金如土了。
    假使他们向上级要钱的时候，就像希望增加他们自己的工资一样，那末，我们也希望他们花钱的时候，也像花他们自己的工资一样。
