Xinhua News Agency Report: Iran has suggested convening a conference of nine Middle Eastern Muslim countries.

Iran made the suggestion to relevant countries on December 9. It suggested that the nine-nation conference include Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, which are members of the Baghdad Pact, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Syria, which are members of the Arab League, as well as Iraq, which is a member of both alliances.

Because of the Iranian government's invitation, Syrian political figures believe that the United States is currently striving to find a way to satisfy the four Muslim countries of the Baghdad Pact without damaging the United States' position in the Arab East, in order to resolve the crisis between the Arab countries and the members of the Baghdad Pact.

It is pointed out here that the United States is trying its best to replace the Baghdad Pact with a new Muslim alliance that does not include Britain.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, December 14th: An Iraqi government spokesman said on the evening of the 13th that Iraq had accepted Iran's invitation to participate in the conference of Middle Eastern Muslim countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Amman, December 14th: A Jordanian government spokesman said on the 13th that the Jordanian government would not give a formal reply to the Iranian government's suggestion to invite it to participate in a high-level conference of nine Middle Eastern Muslim countries until it had consulted with and reached a consensus with other Arab League countries.

The spokesman said that Jordan is considering Iran's invitation.

    美国企图以穆斯林联盟代替巴格达条约
    约旦将同其他阿拉伯联盟国家商讨对策
    据新华社讯　伊朗已经建议召开中东九个穆斯林国家的会议。
    伊朗的建议是在12月9日向有关国家提出的。它建议，在这个九国会议中包括参加巴格达条约的伊朗、巴基斯坦和土耳其，参加阿拉伯联盟的埃及、约旦、黎巴嫩、沙特阿拉伯和叙利亚，以及同时参加两个联盟的伊拉克。
    由于伊朗政府这次的发出邀请，叙利亚政界人士认为美国目前正在竭力寻求一种既能使巴格达条约的四个穆斯林国家满意而又不会损害美国在阿拉伯东方的地位的方法，以解决阿拉伯国家和巴格达条约成员国之间发生的危机。
    此间指出，美国竭力要以没有英国参加的新的穆斯林联盟来代替巴格达条约。
    据新华社14日讯　巴格达消息：伊拉克政府的一位发言人13日晚上说，伊拉克已经接受了伊朗请它参加中东穆斯林国家会议的邀请。
    据新华社14日讯　安曼消息：约旦政府发言人13日说，约旦政府在同其他阿拉伯联盟国家商讨并取得一致意见以前，不会对伊朗政府邀请它参加中东九个穆斯林国家高级会议的建议作出正式答复。
    这个发言人说，约旦对伊朗的邀请正在加以考虑中。
