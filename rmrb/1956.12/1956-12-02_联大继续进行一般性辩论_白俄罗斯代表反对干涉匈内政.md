Xinhua News Agency, December 1st, New York Dispatch: At the United Nations General Assembly meeting on November 30th, the Middle East issue and the so-called "Hungarian question" continued to be the central topics of discussion in the general debate. News from within and outside the meeting indicates that Western countries, primarily the United States, intend to once again use the so-called "Hungarian question" to stir up new hysteria and divert attention from the tense situation in the Middle East.

The Belarusian Foreign Minister, Kiselev, was the first to speak at the General Assembly that day. He said that the United Nations Emergency Force must not be allowed to be used as a tool of the policies of Britain, France, and Israel.

Kiselev condemned the Western countries' attempts to obstruct the resolution of the disarmament issue, and he especially condemned the revival of German militarism in West Germany, which had brought disaster to Belarus twice.

The Belarusian representative also firmly expressed opposition to any attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of Hungary.

Representatives from Colombia, Paraguay, and Ireland also spoke in the general debate. The Paraguayan representative, Montalto Vargas, on the one hand, condemned the aggression against Egypt, and at the same time, he once again brought up the so-called "Hungarian question."

The Irish representative, Cosgrave, said that his country "understands and sympathizes" with those countries that are deeply disturbed by the aggression against Egypt. However, he also requested that representatives of Asian and African countries not overemphasize this aggression. He urged Britain, France, and Israel to quickly withdraw their invading troops, saying that otherwise it would provide the Soviet Union with "excellent propaganda material." He said, "It must be ensured that the Soviet Union does not gain a foothold."

Cosgrave also brought up the "Hungarian event" again, attempting to divert the Assembly's attention from the situation in the Near East.

Finally, the President of the Assembly announced that the general debate would continue on December 3rd.

    联大继续进行一般性辩论
　　白俄罗斯代表反对干涉匈内政
    新华社1日讯　纽约消息：在联合国大会11月30日的会议上，中东问题和所谓“匈牙利问题”继续是一般辩论中谈论的中心问题。会议内外的消息表明，西方国家、首先是美国，打算再一次利用所谓“匈牙利问题”来煽起新的歇斯底里，转移人们对中东紧张局势的注意。
    白俄罗斯外交部长基谢廖夫在这天大会上第一个发言。他说，决不容许把联合国紧急部队用作英国、法国和以色列的政策的工具。
    基谢廖夫谴责西方国家千方百计地阻挠解决裁军问题，他特别谴责两次给白俄罗斯带来灾难的德国军国主义在西德的复活。
    白俄罗斯代表还严正表示反对任何干涉匈牙利内政的企图。
    在一般辩论中发言的还有哥伦比亚、巴拉圭和爱尔兰等国家的代表。巴拉圭代表蒙特多·瓦加斯一方面谴责对埃及的侵略，同时，他又再一次搬出了所谓“匈牙利问题”。
    爱尔兰代表科斯格雷夫说，他的国家“谅解和同情”那些因埃及遭到侵略而深感不安的国家。但是，他又请求亚非国家代表不要过于重视这个侵略。他敦促英、法和以色列迅速撤退它们的侵略军队，他说，不然就会给苏联提供“极好的宣传材料”。他说，“必须保证苏联不会插足进去。”
    科斯格雷夫还重提“匈牙利事件”，企图以此转移大会对近东情况的注意。
    最后，大会主席宣布12月3日继续进行一般性辩论。
