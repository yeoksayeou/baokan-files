Xinhua News Agency, Amman, 2nd December: Jordanian Prime Minister Nabulsi gave a speech on the evening of December 1st to a reporter from Egyptian Radio's "Voice of the Arabs." He called on all Arab nations to unite and fight for freedom. He said that the freedom of all Arab nations is now being threatened by Britain, France, and Israel.
    Nabulsi said that the attack on Egypt is an attack on all Arab nations. He also pointed out: "As long as enemy troops still occupy any part of Egyptian territory, we will consider that this region of the world has not gained independence. As long as Israel still occupies the Gaza Strip, there will be no peace or security there."
    Nabulsi said that he has requested that the Iraqi troops stationed in Jordan uniformly accept the command of the Egyptian-Syrian-Jordanian Joint Headquarters. The commander of this joint headquarters is Egyptian Armed Forces Commander General Amer. Nabulsi said that Jordan will not allow non-Jordanian troops to remain on its territory if these troops are not placed under the leadership of the aforementioned joint headquarters.
    Nabulsi also said that we fully believe that Arab countries will fulfill their promises and provide us with assistance in a timely manner. He said that Jordan will not be able to abolish the British-Jordanian treaty until we receive economic assistance from Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia to replace the British subsidy.

    约旦首相纳布西发表谈话说
　　阿拉伯国家团结起来争取自由
　　伊拉克驻约部队要受联合司令部指挥
    新华社2日讯　安曼消息：约旦首相纳布西1日晚上对埃及电台“阿拉伯之声”记者发表谈话。他要求所有阿拉伯国家团结起来争取自由。他说，所有阿拉伯国家的自由现在正遭受到英法和以色列的威胁。
    纳布西说，对埃及的进攻也就是对所有阿拉伯国家的进攻。他并且指出：“只要敌军还占领埃及的任何一部分土地，我们将认为世界的这个地区就没有获得独立。只要以色列还占领加沙地区，那里也将不会有和平或安全。”
    纳布西说，他已经要求驻在约旦的伊拉克军队统一地接受埃及—叙利亚—约旦联合司令部的指挥。这个联合司令部的司令是埃及武装部队司令阿密尔将军。纳布西说，约旦不允许非约旦军队留在它的领土上，如果这些军队不置于上述联合司令部的领导之下。
    纳布西还说，我们充分相信，阿拉伯国家将会实行它们的诺言，及时地给我们提供援助。他说，在我们从埃及、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯接到经济援助以代替英国的津贴以前，约旦将不能够废除英国—约旦条约。
