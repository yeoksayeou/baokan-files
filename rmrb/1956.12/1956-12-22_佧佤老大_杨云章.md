    "Ka Wa Leader" Yang Yunzhang
  　Yao Leng
    In Kunming, I met Comrade Yang Yunzhang, the “Ka Wa Leader,” who came here to attend a meeting.
    Yang Yunzhang only worked in the Ka Wa Mountains on the Yunnan border for just over a year, but he was already loved by the Ka Wa people, who gave him a nickname and called him "Leader" whenever they met him.
      In the Ka Wa language, "Leader" not only includes the meaning of "elder," but also means a loyal, reliable, and capable person.
    Yang Yunzhang was originally a poor peasant. After liberation, he actively participated in land reform in his hometown and was elected deputy head of Jingma Township in Jinggu County, Yunnan. In 1953, he voluntarily enlisted in the army. From then on, he became a glorious border guard.
    He began his ethnic work in 1955. In late spring of that year, he led a work team to the remote and secluded Banshuai tribe in the Ka Wa Mountains.
    The Banshuai tribe has nine villages, with a total of more than 300 households. The Ka Wa compatriots, who live in these high mountain ridges, have always lived a life of slash-and-burn farming and hunting.
    In order to do his job well, Yang Yunzhang helped the Ka Wa people with their work while learning the Ka Wa language. After three months of hard work, he could speak Ka Wa relatively fluently. He said to me with a humble smile: "Only by mastering the Ka Wa language can we more clearly and thoroughly understand the customs and habits of the Ka Wa compatriots, understand their pain, joy, needs, and hopes, and only in this way can we better serve the Ka Wa people."
    Once, he went to Yangshimi Village in the Banshuai tribe to work. The headman there, Yan Meng, was a man who liked to see all ethnic brothers respect the Ka Wa etiquette, and he often used this standard to measure the hearts of all ethnic brothers. When he saw Yang Yunzhang, who was known as "Leader," come to visit, he deliberately asked him to chew betel nut.
    The fraternal ethnic groups living in this area all like to chew a mixture of lime, tobacco, "sha ji", and betel nut, and sometimes use it to treat guests. It is said that chewing betel nut can strengthen teeth and dispel "miasma." However, for those who have never chewed betel nut, it is very difficult to swallow.
    "Ka Wa Leader" understood Yan Meng's feelings, took the betel nut without saying a word, and chewed it carefully. Although his mouth felt bitter and unbearable, he did not show any emotion and continued to explain the various policies to Yan Meng in his fluent Ka Wa language.
    When Yan Meng saw that the "Leader," who was chewing betel nut for the first time, was not afraid of the spiciness and bitterness of the betel nut, he believed that Yang Yunzhang was indeed a "Leader," and affectionately patted Yang Yunzhang on the shoulder and said, "Leader! I believe all the principles of the Communist Party."
    From then on, the work in Yangshimi went smoothly. More and more Ka Wa brothers in Yangshimi called Yang Yunzhang "Leader" when they saw him.
    Of course, to be a "Ka Wa Leader," it is not enough to simply understand the customs and habits of the Ka Wa people; it is also necessary to understand what pains and hopes the Ka Wa people have and help them solve them.
    Not long after Yang Yunzhang arrived in the Banshuai tribe, he discovered that the Ka Wa men were often troubled by their overly long hair.
    Due to the strict blockade by the reactionary rulers in the past, the Ka Wa compatriots were very backward in economic and cultural life. They did not have a razor or clipper, and when their hair grew long, they used machetes to cut their hair. Every time they cut their hair, they felt pain for a while. However, no one wanted to expose the pain they experienced during haircuts. This is the valiant characteristic of the Ka Wa compatriots.
    Yang Yunzhang discovered this unspoken secret and immediately asked his superiors for a clipper and razor, and saved some of his allowance to buy some of the best soaps. So, he went to the nine villages of Banshuai one after another and became a barber. Yang Yunzhang alone had given haircuts to forty Ka Wa people. For a period of time, the work team became a barber shop, and Ka Wa men lined up waiting, admiring the magic of the clipper, which made people not feel pain and could quickly cut off hair, while smelling the pungent fragrance emitted by the soap foam.
    Yan Xin, the headman of Axing Village, was particularly interested in soap. Within a few days, he asked the "Leader" to wash his hair twenty times.
    Although Yang Yunzhang was not a barber, he now mastered skilled haircutting techniques. Yang Yunzhang had never been a doctor, but for the needs of his work, he had learned to treat common diseases. From January to May 1955, he treated eighteen people with headaches, stomach aches, and malaria, and five people who had been cut by knives.
    He also taught the Ka Wa people to grow vegetables, reducing the casualties suffered by the Ka Wa people when hunting in the mountains. Today, the Banshuai tribe is no longer as desolate as it used to be. On the wide slopes, there are large green vegetable fields, large purple eggplant gardens, and on the fences, there are huge pumpkins, bunches of cucumbers, and green jade-like bitter gourds.
    It was through these ordinary tasks such as treating illnesses, giving haircuts, teaching vegetable growing, and helping with carrying water, chopping firewood, plowing fields, and husking rice... that Yang Yunzhang established the prestige of the Party in the Banshuai tribe and made many close Ka Wa friends. He relied on these friendly relations to play a significant role in the struggle against the enemy.
    In February of this year, the government invited Yan Xin, Yan Zhong, and Yan Ling, the headmen, to visit Kunming. Before the three headmen set off, they were supposed to perform a "chicken divination" according to their customs. Because the "chicken divination" did not go smoothly, and because of rumors spread by special agents, they decided to decline the government's invitation.
  "Ka Wa Leader" immediately went to figure out how to get through to them. While refuting the rumors, he told them about the improved living conditions of the farmers in Kunming. They believed that what the "Leader" said was loyal and reliable, and only then did they decide to go to Kunming.
    After their visit, they returned to Banshuai full of energy, recognizing the greatness and loveliness of the motherland. At the same time, they automatically promoted what they had seen and heard, day and night. From their conversations, it was known that they particularly admired the rice yield in Kunming. The "Ka Wa Leader" seized this point and immediately mobilized Headman Yan Xin to organize a mutual aid team. He explained the advantages of the mutual aid team clearly, deeply touching Yan Xin's heart. Thus, a mutual aid team voluntarily formed by nineteen households appeared in the primitive tribe of slash-and-burn farming.
    Yang Yunzhang, who came to Kunming for the meeting this time, was still thinking about that mutual aid team day and night. Ah! It is a guiding star in the Banshuai tribe, and it will guide the primitive tribe to transition directly to socialist society. (Attached picture)

    “佧佤老大”杨云章
  　姚冷
    在昆明我会见了到这里来开会的“佧佤老大”杨云章同志。
    杨云章只在云南边疆的佧佤山做了一年多的民族工作，就被佧佤族人民热爱起来，大伙给他起了个绰号，见面就喊他一声“老大”。
      “老大”在佧佤语言中，不只包含着“长辈”的意思，而且也意味着是一个忠实可靠的能干的人。
    杨云章原是一个贫农，解放后，在家乡积极参加了土地改革，被选为云南景谷县景马乡的副乡长。1953年，他自动报名参军。从这时起，他做了一名光荣的边防战士。
    他从1955年开始做民族工作。那年春末，他带一个工作组到了遥远而僻静的佧佤山的班帅部落。
    班帅部落有九个寨子，共三百多户人家。聚居在那一带高山梁子上的佧佤族同胞，一直过着刀耕火种和围山猎兽的生活。
    杨云章为了把工作做好，一边帮助佧佤人干活，一边学习佧佤语言，经过三个月的勤学苦练，他能比较流畅地讲佧佤话了。他带着谦虚的笑容对我说：“只有掌握了佧佤语言，才能更清楚、更详尽地懂得佧佤同胞的风俗习惯，懂得他们的痛苦、快乐、需要和希望，也只有这样，才能更好地为佧佤人民工作。”
    有一次，他到班帅部落的杨史米寨去工作。那儿的头人岩勐，是一个喜爱各族兄弟尊重佧佤礼节的人，他常常拿这个标准，来衡量各族兄弟的心。他看到被称为“老大”的杨云章来串门子，就故意请他嚼槟榔。
    居住在这一带的兄弟民族，都喜欢用石灰、烟丝、沙鸡和槟榔混搅起来咀嚼，有时也用它款待客人。据说，嚼槟榔可以巩固牙齿，驱除“瘴气”。然而没有嚼过槟榔的人，是非常难于入口的。
    “佧佤老大”，懂得了岩勐的心情，二话不说，就接过槟榔细嚼起来。尽管口腔感到苦涩难忍，仍然不露一点声色，继续用他那流畅的佧佤语言，对岩勐解释各项政策。
    岩勐看到初嚼槟榔的“老大”，原来并不怕槟榔的辛辣和苦涩，于是，他认为杨云章确实是“老大”，并且亲热地拍拍杨云章的肩头，说：“老大！共产党的道理我全信了。”
    从此，杨史米的工作就顺利开展起来。杨史米越来越多的佧佤兄弟，见到杨云章就喊一声“老大”了。
    自然，想做个“佧佤老大”，仅仅懂得佧佤族的风俗习惯是不够的，还必须懂得，佧佤人有些什么痛苦和希望，帮助他们解决。
    杨云章到班帅部落不久，就发现佧佤族的汉子们经常为自己过长的头发而苦恼。
    由于过去反动统治者的严密封锁，佧佤同胞在经济和文化生活上非常落后。他们没有一把剃刀或推剪，头发长了，就用砍刀理发。理一回，疼一阵。可是，谁也不愿暴露理发时所经历的痛苦。这是佧佤同胞剽悍的特性。
    杨云章发现了这个心照不宣的秘密，立刻向上级要了一把推剪和剃刀，自己又把津贴省下，买了一些最好的香皂。于是，他先后下到班帅的九个寨子，当起理发员来了。光是杨云章一人，就给四十个佧佤人理过发。有一个时期，工作组变成了理发店，佧佤汉子排队等着，他们一面欣赏推剪使人不痛而又能迅速推掉头发的魔力，一面闻着香皂沫散发出来的刺鼻香味。
    阿兴寨的头人岩新，对香皂特别感到兴趣，他在几天之内，就要求“老大”给他洗过二十次头。
    杨云章虽然不是理发师，现在却掌握了熟练的理发技术。杨云章也没当过医生，但是为了工作的需要，已经学会治疗普通的疾病了。从1955年1月到5月，他治好过十八个头痛、肚疼、打摆子的病人和五个被刀砍伤的人。
    他还教会了佧佤人种菜，减少了佧佤人围山猎兽时所遭到的伤亡。如今，班帅部落再不像过去那样荒芜了，在宽敞的山坡上，有大片绿色的青菜地，有大片紫色的茄子园，在篱笆上，结着硕大的南瓜、累累的黄瓜和绿玉似的苦瓜。
    杨云章就是这样通过治病、理发、教种菜和帮助担水、砍柴、犁地、舂米……一点一滴的平凡的工作，在班帅部落给党树立了威信，交上了许多知心的佧佤族朋友。他凭借这些朋友关系，在对敌斗争的工作中，起到很大的作用。
    今年2月间，政府邀请岩新、岩中、岩领头人去昆明参观。三位头人在动身之前，照例要按他们的风俗习惯打个“鸡卦”。因为“鸡卦”没打通，加上特务造谣，他们就决定谢绝政府的邀请。
  “佧佤老大”立刻去想法打通他们的思想，他一面辟谣，一面把昆明农民生活改善的情况讲给他们听。他们认为“老大”的话忠实可靠，这才决定动身去昆明。
    他们参观之后回到班帅，感到浑身是劲，认识到祖国的伟大和可爱。同时不分日夜，自动宣传所见所闻。从他们的谈话中，知道他们对昆明的稻谷产量特别羡慕。“佧佤老大”看准了这点，立刻动员岩新头人组织互助组。他把互助组的优越性，讲得一清二楚，深深打动了岩新的心。于是，一个由十九户人家自愿组成的互助组，在刀耕火种的原始部落出现了。
    杨云章这次到昆明开会还日日夜夜在想念那个互助组。是啊！那是班帅部落的一颗启明星，它将要引导原始部落，直接过渡到社会主义社会。（附图片）
