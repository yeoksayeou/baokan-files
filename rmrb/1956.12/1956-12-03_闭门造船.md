　　Building Ships Behind Closed Doors
　　Zhu Qi
　　In ancient times, there was building carts behind closed doors; who would have thought that today there would be building ships behind closed doors. In the spring of 1956, the leaders of the Gansu Provincial Department of Transportation ordered a 200-ton ship from a shipyard in another province, planning to open a route on the Bailong River in the upper reaches of the Jialing River.

　　This idea is certainly not bad, but since the leaders of the Department of Transportation intended to open a route, they did not even go to the site to understand the width of the Bailong River, the size of the bends, or the amount of flow, and hastily passed the decision.

　　Perhaps some people would think that the Bailong River is probably a small waterway that does not require surveying, and even if there is some engineering, it will not cost much labor. But if you ask the Wudu Prefectural Transportation Department, you will know that the Bailong River in Gansu Province, from Wudu County to Yaodu at the junction of Gansu and Sichuan provinces, is 159 kilometers long. According to navigation requirements, the entire line should be renovated. Preliminary estimates require at least 110,000 cubic meters of stone beaches to be cleared, and more than 110,000 cubic meters of reefs to be blasted. Adding the work of digging sand beaches and building stone dams requires at least 480,000 man-days. Is such a project not worth investigating by the leaders of the Gansu Provincial Department of Transportation?

　　Without understanding the situation, decisions were made behind closed doors, and the result was that it didn't work. In September, the river repair engineering team directly commanded by the Gansu Provincial Department of Transportation arrived in Wudu, and more than 1,300 of the more than 2,000 migrant workers requested from the Wudu Prefecture also came. The entire line started construction in October. Who knew that after a few days, several counties received instructions not to transfer migrant workers. It turned out that people from the province came and found that the Bailong River was narrow and shallow, with many bends, and a long section of the river surface was between steep stone gorges, with a width of less than 20 meters. This year, the personnel who came to the Bailong River to conduct navigation measurements in the spring and summer mainly referred to some of the log rafting measurement data from the Bailong River Logging Yard Preparatory Office, which was extremely unthorough. It is obviously impossible to navigate a 200-ton ship without investing huge sums of money to renovate the river. What is most noteworthy is that the river channel from Yaodu to Zhaohua in Sichuan has not been renovated. Even if the Bailong River in Gansu is opened up, how can the 200-ton large ship be transported from there? If the ship is dismantled into parts and transported to Wudu, who can install it without a factory? Because these problems could not be solved, the full-line construction had to be changed to "key experimental construction."

　　"Key experimental construction" is also a nice way of putting it, but no matter how nice the words are, they cannot conceal the subjectivism of the Gansu Provincial Department of Transportation on this issue.

　　闭门造船
　　朱旗
    古有闭门造车，不想今日也有闭门造船的事情。1956年春天，甘肃省交通厅的首长们向外地造船厂订了一艘二百吨的轮船，准备在嘉陵江上游的白龙江开辟航线。
    这个想法当然不坏，可是，交通厅的首长们既然打算开辟航线，却连白龙江的河面是宽是窄，弯道是大是小，流量有多少，也没有到现场去了解一下，就草率地通过了决定。
    也许有人会想，白龙江大概是条小小的河道，无需勘测，即便有些工程也花不了几个人工。但只要你向武都专署交通部门一问，就会知道，甘肃境内的白龙江，从武都县到甘川两省交界处的姚渡，全长一百五十九公里，按通航要求应全线整修，初步估算，需清理的石滩至少有十一万方，需炸毁的礁石有十一万多方，加上挖沙滩、修石坝等工程至少需民工四十八万个，难道这样的工程也值不得甘肃省交通厅领导们调查一下么？
    不了解情况，关起门来就做了决定，结果是行不通。9月间甘肃省交通厅直接指挥的修河工程队到达武都，向武都专区要的民工二千多人也来了一千三百多人，10月间全线开工。谁知过了没有几天，有几个县就收到不调民工的指示。原来省上来了人，发现白龙江江窄水浅，弯道多，还有很长一段河面在陡立的石峡间，宽度不够二十公尺。今年春夏间到白龙江来作航行测量的人员，主要是参考了一些白龙江伐木场筹备处的漂木测量资料，极不细致。航行二百吨的轮船，不花巨额投资整治河道显然行不通。最值得注意的是，白龙江从姚渡到四川的昭化一段，河道没有整修，就算把甘肃境内的白龙江修通了，二百吨的大轮船从那里运进来呢？若是把船拆成零件运到武都，没有工厂谁能安装呢？因为这些问题无法解决，全线施工不得已改为“重点试验施工”了。
      “重点试验施工”，倒也说得好听，只是再好听的话也掩饰不了甘肃省交通厅在这个问题上的主观主义。
