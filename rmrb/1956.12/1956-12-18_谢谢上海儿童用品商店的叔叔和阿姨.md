“Thank you, Uncles and Aunts of the Shanghai Children's Goods Store”

	Not long ago, my four-year-old daughter put on a beautiful sweater set newly sent from the Shanghai Children's Goods Store. She was so happy that she jumped and sang, and kept asking me to say, "Quickly write a letter to the uncles and aunts of the Shanghai Children's Goods Store to thank them for buying me the sweater!"
	Back in July or August of this year, when I passed through Shanghai on a business trip, I bought a set of woolen clothes for my daughter at the Shanghai Children's Goods Store. However, when I returned to Beijing and took out the beautiful clothes for my daughter to try on, the clothes were too tight and too small. In great annoyance, I had no choice but to write a letter to the Shanghai Children's Goods Store, asking if it was possible to return or exchange them.
	I quickly received a reply from the Shanghai Children's Goods Store. The letter told me that if the clothes bought were not suitable, not only could I get a refund, but I could also exchange them for other clothing. It also gave a detailed introduction to several styles, qualities, and prices of clothes that could be exchanged. With gratitude and trust, I immediately sent back the small clothes and asked them to exchange them for a sweater set.
	About ten days later, the staff of the Shanghai Children's Goods Store wrote me another letter, asking me to describe the color and style of the sweater I wanted to exchange in more detail. I did as they asked.
	After this letter was sent, more than twenty days passed without receiving a reply or the clothes. Of course, this did not diminish my trust in them, but I began to consider: Could it be that they were too busy and had forgotten about my request to exchange the clothes?
	Just as I was about to write a letter to inquire, I received another letter from them. This letter was very polite and wrote: "...You said in your letter that we were adding to your troubles, but in fact, we don't feel troubled at all, because we should be serving our customers. ...The kind of sweater you need is out of stock in our store, so we had to use the yarn from our store to have a set made for you outside. This is the reason why the sweater is only being sent today, and we hope you can understand. ..." What is there not to understand? I really don't know how to thank them for such good service!　Ting Yi

### “谢谢上海儿童用品商店的叔叔和阿姨”

    “谢谢上海儿童用品商店的叔叔和阿姨”
    不久以前，我的四岁的小女儿穿上了新从上海儿童用品商店寄来的一套漂亮的毛衣，她高兴得又跳又唱，不住地要求我说：“快写信给上海儿童用品商店的叔叔和阿姨，谢谢他们替我买毛衣吧！”
    还是在今年7、8月间，我因公路过上海，在上海儿童用品商店为我的女儿买了一套呢绒衣服。但是，当我回到北京拿出那件漂亮衣服给女儿试穿时，衣服竟是又瘦又小。我在十分懊恼的情况下，只好写信给上海儿童用品商店，问问是不是可以退换。
    很快地我便接到上海儿童用品商店的回信。信上告诉我：如果买去的衣服不合适，不仅可以退款，而且也可以调换其他衣物。并且还详细地介绍了几种可调换的衣服的样式、质量和价格。我怀着感激和信任的心情，立刻把那件瘦小的衣服寄还，并且请他们代为调换一套毛衣。
    过了十天左右，上海儿童用品商店的工作人员又给我写来了一封信，要求我把所要调换的毛衣的颜色和样式写得更详细一些我也照着办了。
    这封信寄出去以后，过了二十多天没有接到他们的回信，也不见衣物寄来。这当然并没有减少我对他们的信任，不过我开始考虑：会不会因为他们工作太忙，而把我要求调换衣物的事忘记了呢？
    当我正打算写信去催问的时候，就又接到了他们的来信。这封信上非常客气地写着：“……您信里说给我们增添麻烦，其实我们并不感到麻烦，因为我们是应该为顾客服务的。……您所需要的那种毛衣，我店已经脱销，所以只好用我店的毛线，替你在外面照样加工了一套。这就是迟到今天才将毛衣寄去的原因，希能谅解。……”这还有什么不能谅解的？对于他们这么好的服务态度，我真不知道应该怎样感谢才好呢！　亭逸
