Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 14th (Reporter Xu Fang): Anshan Iron and Steel Company reached the 1957 production value level one year and one month ahead of schedule. The total cost of goods and the output of pig iron and steel products, among the main products, also reached the 1957 level ahead of schedule. In addition, the output of six products, including manganese ore, cast iron pipes, and ferroalloys, reached the targets for the final year of the first Five-Year Plan.

From the beginning of December last year to the end of November this year, the total output value of Anshan Iron and Steel increased 2.3 times compared to the beginning of the first Five-Year Plan, steel output increased 1.8 times, and pig iron output increased more than 2.3 times. In the past four years, Anshan Iron and Steel Company adopted more than 37,000 rationalization proposals put forward by employees, creating nearly 40 million yuan in wealth. The labor productivity of workers is rapidly increasing. In November this year, each worker at Anshan Iron and Steel created an average of more than 2,440 yuan in value, an increase of more than 1,450 yuan compared to November 1952.

With the help of the Soviet government and Soviet experts, Anshan Iron and Steel has built many new factories and mines. From 1953 to now, five new automated blast furnaces, eight new types of coking ovens, and more than a dozen newly built and renovated open-hearth furnaces have been put into production. The production capacity of the newly built large-scale rolling mill, seamless steel tube plant, and second sheet mill all exceeded the original design standards.

In the past four years of the first Five-Year Plan, the employees of Anshan Iron and Steel have been changing the production landscape of many old factories day by day with great enthusiasm and wisdom. They solved the long-standing problems of heat generation in the large motor of the primary rolling mill, and renovated the continuous rolling mill, thereby greatly improving the production capacity of the primary rolling mill, so that the number of tons of steel rolled per hour in the entire plant in November this year increased by an average of 89% compared to 1952. The small rolling mill, loading steel, pushing steel, calendering, and coiling processes, where labor conditions were very poor in the past, have now mostly been converted to mechanization and automation. On the sites of many factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel, it can be seen that those heavy manual labor tasks of the past have been replaced by machines.

The employees of Anshan Iron and Steel learned many new Soviet technologies and also exchanged a lot of advanced experiences with each other. After the ironmaking plant used high-basicity sintered ore and promoted new technologies such as steam blowing and high hot blast temperature operation, the blast furnace utilization coefficient averaged 0.735 from January to November this year. Compared with 0.873 in 1952, the production capacity increased by 22%. The amount of coke consumed per ton of pig iron also decreased from 897 kg in 1952 to 760 kg. Since the steelmaking plant converted seven open-hearth furnaces to chrome-magnesite brick roofs, it has more effectively promoted the advanced experience of rapid steelmaking. From January to November this year, the average amount of steel ingots produced per square meter of hearth area in the first steelmaking plant has increased from 5.78 tons in 1952 to 7.17 tons.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 14th. By the end of November, Anshan Iron and Steel Company had overfulfilled the task of reducing the total cost of goods stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan by one year and one month ahead of schedule, saving a total of more than 136.7 million yuan for the country.

The reduction in the total cost of goods at Anshan Iron and Steel is mainly the result of increasing labor productivity, relatively reducing fixed costs, and saving raw materials and reducing consumption quotas. In 1952, the value created by an average of five workers at Anshan Iron and Steel can now be completed by only two workers. In terms of saving raw materials and reducing consumption quotas, 883 kg of coke were required to produce one ton of steel in 1952, while only 729 kg were required in November this year; the amount of iron and steel raw materials consumed per ton of steel produced was also reduced by more than 30 kg compared to 1952. Steelworkers have also launched a savings campaign. By the end of November this year, the total amount of cost reductions for the entire company has increased by nearly one-fold compared to the actual amount of cost reductions last year.

Currently, many factories and mines at Anshan Iron and Steel are further formulating plans for saving measures. The Chemical Plant originally planned to reduce costs by more than 600,000 yuan in the fourth quarter compared to the plan. The factory director and the Party committee secretary organized employees to discuss and proposed 52 saving measures. By the beginning of December, the cost reduction target had increased to 1.6 million yuan. The Ironmaking Plant originally believed that this year's costs would exceed the budget by 800,000 yuan, but after discussions among employees, not only can the budget be kept within limits, but it can also be reduced compared to the plan.

### 新企业源源投入生产，旧厂矿面貌一新  鞍钢提前完成五年计划  四年中总产值提高二点三倍，总成本降低一亿三千多万元

    新企业源源投入生产，旧厂矿面貌一新
    鞍钢提前完成五年计划
    四年中总产值提高二点三倍，总成本降低一亿三千多万元
    新华社鞍山14日电　新华社记者徐放报道：鞍山钢铁公司提前一年零一个月达到了1957年的生产总值水平。商品总成本和主要产品中的生铁、钢材的产量，也都提前达到了1957年的水平。此外还有锰矿石、铸铁管、铁合金等六种产品产量达到了第一个五年计划最后一年的指标。
    从去年12月初到今年11月底，鞍钢生产的总产值比第一个五年计划开始的时候提高了二点三倍，钢材产量提高了一点八倍，生铁产量提高了二点三倍多。在近四年中，鞍山钢铁公司采纳了职工们提出的三万七千多件合理化建议，创造了将近四千万元的财富。工人的劳动生产率在迅速提高，今年11月份鞍钢每一个工人平均能创造二千四百四十多元的价值，比1952年11月增加了一千四百五十多元。
    鞍钢在苏联政府和苏联专家的帮助下，建设了许多新的厂矿。从1953年到现在，已经有五座新的自动化高炉、八座新型的炼焦炉和十几座新建、改建的平炉投入了生产。新建的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、第二薄板厂的生产能力都超过了原来的设计标准。
    在第一个五年计划的近四年中，鞍钢的职工用高度的热情和智慧日新月异地改变着许多旧厂的生产面貌。解决了初轧厂大马达长期以来存在的发热等问题，并且改造了连轧机，从而大大提高了初轧机的生产能力，使今年11月份全厂每小时轧钢的数量比1952年平均提高了89％。过去劳动条件很坏的小型轧钢厂、装钢、推钢、压延、卷线等工序，现在大多已经改成机械化自动化。在鞍钢许多厂矿的现场上，可以看到过去那些笨重的人力劳动已经由机器代替了。
    鞍钢的职工们学习了许多苏联新技术，也互相交流了不少先进经验。炼铁厂使用了高碱度的烧结矿，推行了蒸气鼓风和高风温操作等新技术以后，高炉利用系数今年1月到11月平均达到零点七三五，同1952年的零点八七三比较，生产能力提高了22％。每吨生铁所消耗的焦炭量也从1952年的八百九十七公斤减少到七百六十公斤。炼钢厂自从把七座平炉改为铬镁砖炉顶以后，更有效地推广了快速炼钢的先进经验。第一炼钢厂今年1月到11月份平均每平方公尺炉底面积所生产的钢锭量已经从1952年的五点七八吨，增加到七点一七吨。
    新华社鞍山14日电　鞍山钢铁公司到11月底为止，已经提前一年零一个月超额完成第一个五年计划规定的降低商品总成本的任务，共计为国家节约了一亿三千六百七十多万元。
    鞍钢商品总成本的降低，主要是提高劳动生产率，相对地降低了固定费用和节约原材料、降低消耗定额的结果。在1952年鞍钢平均需要五个工人所创造的价值，现在只要两个工人就能够完成了。在节约原材料降低消耗定额方面，1952年每炼一吨钢铁需要八百八十三公斤焦炭，而今年11月只要七百二十九公斤；每炼一吨钢所消耗的钢铁原料，也比1952年减少了三十公斤以上。钢铁工人们还开展了节约运动。今年到11月底为止，全公司降低的成本总额比去年实际降低成本额增加了将近一倍。
    目前，鞍钢许多厂矿还在进一步制定节约措施计划。化工总厂原定第四季度比计划降低成本六十多万元，厂长、党委书记组织职工讨论，提出了五十二项节约措施，到12月初，降低成本的指标增加到了一百六十万元。炼铁厂原来认为今年的成本将超支八十万元，可是经过职工讨论之后，不但可以不超支，而且可以比计划降低。
