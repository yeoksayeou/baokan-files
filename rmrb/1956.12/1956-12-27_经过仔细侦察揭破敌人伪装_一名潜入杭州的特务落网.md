Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, December 26th. On December 13th, the Hangzhou Public Security organs, with the assistance of local people, captured Wang Shijing, the station chief of the "Hangzhou Communication Station" sent by the "Intelligence Bureau" of the Taiwan Kuomintang secret service.

Wang Shijing, using the alias "Zhao Limin," infiltrated the mainland from Hong Kong in April of this year and arrived in Hangzhou. Prior to this, he had received ten months of "all-around intelligence" training in Taiwan. His main mission in infiltrating the mainland was to establish a radio station and collect intelligence on military and political affairs. When the public security organs legally arrested Wang Shijing, they found six instruction letters and secret writing tools given to him by the secret service in his home. Wang Shijing has confessed to his identity as a spy and his counter-revolutionary mission.

Before his arrest, Wang Shijing was an accountant at the Second Branch of the jointly-owned Hangzhou Wulian Cotton Cloth Store. He obtained this position by posing as an unemployed worker returning from Hong Kong and registering for employment. After arriving at the store, he pretended to be "active" in his work, studied his business diligently, and frequently helped others. He also actively engaged in various social activities, teaching young colleagues to dance and colleagues who loved martial arts to practice Tai Chi. He attempted to deceive and win over those around him. In addition, people also discovered that he had various skills, such as being able to do fitter work and open various locks.

Initially, the new accountant gave people a good impression, but suspicious signs gradually emerged. He only earned 45 yuan a month, had to support his elderly mother, smoked, drank alcohol, and treated people to the theater and restaurants. Even more strangely, this unemployed worker who returned from Hong Kong had several hundred yuan in savings in the bank. After the masses reported these situations to the public security organs, the public security organs conducted a meticulous investigation of this person with an unknown background based on these clues. The investigation revealed that this person was a spy sent from Taiwan. After solving the case, the person in charge of the Hangzhou Public Security Organs told reporters: Although the enemy is becoming increasingly cunning, and they are trying their best to find various ways to disguise themselves, they always have tails that cannot be hidden, and they cannot escape the bright eyes of the people.

    经过仔细侦察揭破敌人伪装
    一名潜入杭州的特务落网
    新华社杭州26日电　12月13日，杭州市公安机关在当地群众协助下，捕获了台湾国民党特务机关“情报局”派来的“杭州通讯站”站长王石景。
    王石景化名“赵立民”，是在今年4月从香港混入大陆来到杭州的。在这以前，他在台湾曾经受了十个月的“全能情报”训练。他潜入大陆的主要任务是：建立电台，搜集军事、政治等方面的情报。公安机关在依法逮捕王石景的时候，在他家里搜出了特务机关给他的六件指示信和密写用具。王石景对于他的特务身分和反革命任务已经供认不讳。
    王石景在被逮捕前，是公私合营杭州五联棉布店第二门市部的会计。这个职务是由他冒充从香港回来的失业工人，经过登记介绍得到的。他到店里以后，伪装工作“积极”、钻研业务，还经常帮助别人，同时还积极从事各种社交活动，教年轻的同事跳舞，教爱好国术的同事打太极拳。企图以此蒙蔽和拉拢周围的人。此外，人们还发现他有多方面的技能，例如会做钳工、开各种锁等等。
    这个新来的会计起初给人的印象是不坏的，但是也逐渐露出了可疑的迹象。他每月只有四十五元工资，要奉养老母亲，要吃烟、喝酒，还要请人看戏、上馆子。更奇怪的是，这个从香港回来的失业工人，竟会在银行里有几百元存款。群众把这些情况反映给公安机关以后，公安机关根据这些线索对这个底细不明的人进行了细致的侦察，结果查明这个人原来是一个被派遣来的特务。杭州市公安机关负责人在破案以后对记者说：敌人虽然越来越狡猾，他们想竭力找出各种办法来伪装自己，但是他们总有掩藏不了的尾巴，是逃不过人民的明亮的眼睛的。
