In recent months, individual handicraft producers in various provinces and cities have seen significant development. In Shanghai, the number of individual households was only 1,661 with over 5,000 employees in September; by October, this had grown to 2,885 households and over 8,100 employees. In Guangzhou, the number of individual handicraft employees increased by over 1,100 in the single month of September. In Wuhan, after the high tide of cooperation, only 2,000 individual employees remained, but by September, this number had increased to nearly 8,000. In other provinces and cities, such as Tianjin, Beijing, Qingdao, Zhengzhou, Chengdu, and Guangxi, the number of individual households and employees has also increased exponentially. Some comrades in handicraft management agencies, who had thought there would be nothing to do after the high tide of cooperation and were even considering closing down their agencies, are now alarmed by the increase in individual producers and are saying, "Capitalist spontaneous forces are about to run rampant!" Some leaders of cooperative organizations are also uneasy about the increase in individual producers, fearing that it will hinder the consolidation and development of cooperatives. They believe that the development of individual handicraft producers after the high tide of cooperation is abnormal.

In fact, the development of individual handicraft producers after the high tide of cooperation is not surprising. According to the pattern of previous years, handicraft production always sees some development after the market enters its peak season each year. Since the beginning of autumn this year, due to the increased income of the vast number of workers and peasants, there has been a phenomenon of supply falling short of demand for some products and certain service industries in the market. For example, the Shanghai Handcrafted Leather Shoe Cooperative planned to produce 95,000 pairs in the third quarter, but actually produced over 100,980 pairs, while the demand from various quarters reached over 173,000 pairs. Because handicraft production is relatively simple and it is easier to purchase raw materials since the opening of the free market, those handicraft households that had closed down before the high tide of cooperation have resumed business. Some unemployed or jobless urban residents and housewives have also engaged in handicraft production. Some farmers who were originally engaged in sideline production in rural areas have also become professional handicraft producers. Some independent handicraft producers and small business owners who had newly joined cooperatives, seeing that individual operation was profitable, have also withdrawn from the cooperatives to operate independently. The development of individual handicraft producers has, on the one hand, met the needs of the people and increased the supply of goods in the market; on the other hand, it has expanded the number of employed people in the cities. This is beneficial and harmless to the country.

Some comrades' ideas that handicraft management agencies could be abolished and handicraft labor associations could be dissolved after the high tide of cooperation are unrealistic. China has a large population, and the demand for industrial products and service industries is very high, and this demand is growing year by year. Relying solely on modern industry and existing cooperatives will not be able to fully meet the needs in terms of either the quantity or variety of products for the time being. With the increasing social needs, handicrafts that exist as sidelines to agriculture will not only now but also in the future gradually separate from farmers and become professional handicraft producers. Among the small number of unemployed or jobless urban residents, some will become handicraft producers not only now but also in the future. That is to say, the continued development of individual handicraft producers is an inevitable trend for a considerable period to come. Therefore, the work of socialist transformation of individual handicraft producers must continue in the future: transforming a batch this year, and another batch will appear next year; transforming a batch next year, and another batch will appear the year after next... What we need to consider now is not abolishing handicraft management agencies and dissolving handicraft labor associations, but how to use these agencies and organizations to strengthen the leadership and education of individual handicraft producers and guide them to gradually embark on the road of cooperation.

Of course, the development of individual handicraft producers also reflects shortcomings in the work of handicraft cooperation. Some cooperative organizations, when implementing reorganization and transformation, did not consider the characteristics of production and other specific conditions, and centralized production that should not have been centralized; they mechanically applied the working hour system of modern factories, so that members could not produce more during peak seasons or increase their income. Some cooperatives, when deciding on the distribution of income, inappropriately increased the proportion of accumulation; some did not provide appropriate arrangements for the original small business owners and family auxiliary labor. As a result, the income of some members not only did not increase compared to before, but decreased. Therefore, some members felt that joining the cooperative was not as good as individual operation and requested to withdraw from the cooperative, or worked in the cooperative during the day and did odd jobs at home at night. Although every member has the freedom to withdraw from the cooperative, and individual operation can also increase wealth for society, leaders at all levels of cooperative organizations should learn from the events of members withdrawing from the cooperative, examine and improve their work. Each handicraft cooperative should strive to overcome all unreasonable and inappropriate phenomena in terms of business management, income distribution, wage assessment, and arrangements for small business owners and family auxiliary labor, so that members can recognize the superiority of cooperation from the actual benefits of production development and increased income, and thus cherish the cooperative more and care more about the cooperative.

The development of individual handicraft producers is normal, but it is wrong to engage in illegal exploitation and seek illegal profits. Now, in some provinces and cities, handicraft management departments have not paid timely attention to strengthening leadership, and some purchasing personnel have purchased products from individual handicraft producers at high prices, ordered too many goods, and prepaid too much deposit, so many individual handicraft producers have hired large numbers of workers for exploitation, tax evasion, tax leakage, rushing to purchase raw materials, shoddy workmanship, and price gouging. If this phenomenon is not eliminated, there is a danger that the market will be disrupted, and capitalist spontaneous forces may stir up trouble in the market. Therefore, we hope that local handicraft bureaus will continue to strengthen the registration of opening and closing businesses. Licenses should be issued to individual producers who do not have licenses but are engaged in professional production; individual producers engaged in temporary sideline production should be required to register. The work of the handicraft labor association should continue to be strengthened, and socialist education should be strengthened for individual producers, explaining the policies to them so that they recognize that developing handicrafts and increasing production are legal, but they must be under the leadership of the government, abide by laws and regulations, and develop steadily and healthily, so as to avoid the difficulty of arranging labor during the off-season. Illegal activities such as tax evasion, tax leakage, and price gouging must be corrected immediately.

Individual handicraft producers are the object of continued transformation through cooperation. The federations of handicraft cooperatives and the grassroots handicraft production cooperatives must pay attention to uniting them and gradually absorbing them into the cooperatives. Do not force those who are temporarily unwilling to join the cooperatives to join. Under possible conditions, we should try our best to help individual producers purchase raw materials and sell their products. We also hope that the commercial departments, tax departments, and banks will also take corresponding measures to make their work conducive to the normal development of handicraft production.

### 怎样对待手工业个体户

    怎样对待手工业个体户
    近几个月来，各省市的手工业个体户都有了很大的发展。上海市在9月份只有个体户一千六百六十一户，从业人员五千多人；10月份就发展到二千八百八十五户，八千一百多人。广州市在9月份一个月内，个体手工业从业人员就增加了一千一百多人。武汉市在合作化高潮以后，只剩下个体从业人员二千人，到9月份又增加到将近八千人。其他如天津、北京、青岛、郑州、成都和广西等省市，个体户和从业人员，也是成倍地增长着。有些手工业管理机构的同志，本以为合作化高潮以后无事可干了，连机关也要撤消了，现在听说个体户增加就大惊小怪地说：“资本主义自发势力又要泛滥了！”有些合作组织的领导人，听说个体户增加以后，也感到不安，怕会妨碍合作社的巩固和发展。他们认为合作化高潮以后手工业个体户的发展是不正常的。
    其实，在合作化高潮以后，手工业个体户的发展是并不奇怪的。按照以往几年的规律，每年市场进入旺季以后，手工业都有一定的发展。今年入秋以来，由于广大职工和农民的收入增加，市场上有些产品和某些服务性行业，出现了供不应求的现象。例如，上海市制皮鞋的手工业合作社在第三季度计划生产九万五千双，实际生产了十万零九千八百多双，各方面要求供应的却达到十七万三千多双。由于手工业生产比较简单，加上自由市场开放以后，购买原料比较方便，所以，那些在合作化高潮以前已经歇业的手工业户就纷纷复业了。一些失业或无业的城市居民和家庭妇女也从事手工业生产了。原来在农村从事副业生产的农民也转为专业的手工业者。有些新参加合作社的独立手工业者和小业主，看见单干有利可图，也退社单干起来。手工业个体户的发展，一方面满足了人民的需要，增加了市场的商品供应；另一方面又扩大了城市的就业人数。这是对国家有利而无害的事情。
    有些同志以为在合作化高潮以后，手工业管理机构就可以撤消，手工业劳动者协会就可以解散等想法，是不合实际的。我国人口众多，对工业品和服务性行业的需要量很大，而且这种需要量年年在增长着。仅靠现代工业和现有的合作社无论在产品数量或者品种方面，一时都不可能充分满足需要。随着社会需要的日益增长，那些作为农业的副业而存在着的手工业，不仅现在，而且将来还会逐渐从农民中分化出来，变为专业的手工业者。在少数失业或无业的城市居民当中，有一些人不仅在现在，而且在将来也还会变为手工业者的。这就是说，手工业个体户的继续发展，在今后相当长的一个时期内是必然的趋势。因此，今后对个体手工业的社会主义改造的工作还要继续下去：今年改造一批，明年又会出现一批；明年改造一批，后年又会出现一批……。现在我们要考虑的，不是撤消手工业管理机构和解散手工业劳动者协会，而是怎样运用这些机构和组织，加强对手工业个体户的领导和教育，引导他们逐步走上合作化的道路。
    当然，从手工业个体户的发展中，也反映了手工业合作化工作有缺点。有些合作组织在实行改组改造的时候，没有考虑到生产的特点和其他具体条件，把不该集中生产的也集中起来了；机械地搬用现代化工厂的工时制度，以致社员在旺季也不能多生产，也不能增加收入。有些合作社在决定收益分配的时候，不适当地提高积累的比例；有的没有给原有的小业主和家庭辅助劳动力以适当安排。结果，一部分社员的收入，不仅没有比以前增加，反而减少了。所以，有些社员就感到参加合作社还不如单干好而要求退社，或者白天在社里做活，晚上回家做外活。虽然每一个社员都有退社的自由，而且退社单干也能给社会增加财富，但是，合作社组织的各级领导人员，应该从社员退社的事件中吸取教训，检查和改进工作。各个手工业合作社应该在经营管理、收益分配、工资评定和对小业主和家庭辅助劳动力的安排等方面，努力克服一切不合理、不妥当的现象，使社员们从生产发展、收入增加的实际利益中，认识合作化的优越性，从而更加爱护合作社，更加关心合作社。
    手工业个体户的发展是正常的，但是，进行非法剥削和牟取非法利润却是错误的。现在，在一些省市里，手工业管理部门没有及时地注意加强领导，某些采购人员又以高价收购个体手工业者的产品，过多地订货，过多地预付订金，因而有许多个体手工业者雇用大批工人进行剥削，偷税、漏税、抢购原料、粗制滥造、哄抬价格等等现象也就发生了。这种现象如果不加以消除，市场就有被扰乱的危险，资本主义自发势力就有可能在市场上兴风作浪。因此，我们希望各地手工业管理局继续加强开业歇业的登记工作。对没有执照而又是专业生产的个体户，要发给执照；对临时的副业性生产的个体户，则要求他们登记。要继续加强手工业劳动者协会的工作，加强对个体户的社会主义教育，向他们交代政策，让他们认识发展手工业、增加生产是合法的，但必须在政府的领导下，遵守法令，稳步地健康地发展，以免造成淡季无法安排劳动力的困难。对于偷税、漏税、哄抬价格等违法行为必须立即纠正。
    个体手工业者是合作化继续改造的对象，手工业合作社的联合社、基层手工业生产合作社必须注意团结他们，逐步吸收他们入社。对于暂时不愿入社的，也不要勉强他们入社。在可能的条件下，应该尽量帮助个体户采购原材料和推销产品。我们还希望商业部门、税务部门和银行也采取相应的措施，使自己的工作有利于手工业生产的正常发展。
