    A Factory Built on Thrift and Hard Work
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Tao Suqi
    The Qiqihar City Machinery Factory, built with a small amount of investment and just over six months, has already produced more than twenty kinds of mechanical equipment such as boilers, winches, and combined heating systems. These products have been unanimously praised by many state-owned factories and construction sites.
    Walking into this factory, one cannot help but be moved by the employees' spirit of hard work and simple living in running the enterprise diligently and thriftily. Of the four factory buildings, three were converted from large warehouses of a clothing factory. The roof of the newly built riveting and forging workshop is made of floorboards from the old warehouse. The equipment in the factory is mostly old machine tools from state-owned factories that were discarded, dating back thirty or forty years. The only new equipment in this factory is the tall cupola furnace, beam crane, and rolling mill, all of which were manufactured by the factory's employees themselves after the factory was established in March of this year. The renovated and newly built factory buildings are both economical and practical. The factory buildings are equipped with heating equipment, the frames are reinforced with sturdy iron frames, the floors are made of wooden blocks sawn from slabwood, and the factory buildings are connected by light railways. The casting workshop is also equipped with overhead cranes, making it very comfortable for the workers to work here. The only thing that feels simple here is the factory director's office, which is located in a small bungalow. The room has no heating equipment and has not been plastered. The ceiling was only recently covered with old newspapers.
    In February of this year, the Qiqihar City Local Industry Bureau assigned the task of building this factory to several industrial cadres of worker origin. They initially thought that to build a mechanical factory that would supply some mechanical equipment and cast iron pipes to state-owned factories and construction sites, it had to be built in a decent manner. The preliminary plan was to invest 420,000 yuan to build this factory, but this plan was not approved, and the state only approved an investment of 175,000 yuan. However, everyone was very enthusiastic about building the factory and decided to make the most of the state's funds and allocated houses and stagnant equipment, and to build the factory through hard work, self-reliance, and thrift, to meet the needs of economic construction.
    On March 1st, Wu Zhenghua, the deputy director of the factory who came from a fitter background, led more than twenty employees to start the factory construction work. Some of them were mechanical workers, and some were surplus personnel from a alkali factory that had stopped production.
    The factory's civil engineering and equipment installation were all undertaken by the factory's employees. They learned and did it at the same time, and cherished the state's assets very much. When the employees first started dismantling the warehouse floor, because the floorboards were nailed very tightly, prying up the nails one by one broke the floorboards into small pieces that could only be used as firewood. The employees thought: If we take them down completely, they can be used as good roofs. According to the dimensions of the new factory building drawings, they cut the whole floor into several large squares and moved them out to use as roofs for the new factory buildings. The employees were very enthusiastic about building the factory and took the initiative to find cheap and good building materials for the factory. Electrical materials, building timber, heating equipment, refractory bricks, etc. used in the substation were all stagnant materials from other factories and enterprises.
    In May, the factory's machinery, riveting, and forging workshops were put into production one after another, and began to manufacture urgently needed new equipment for other factories and construction sites. A construction site needed to purchase twenty-five combined heating machines for winter construction, and they needed them urgently, with many technical difficulties. Because the factory's equipment was old and its technical strength was weak, Cui Rongshan, the factory's technical section chief, initially had no confidence. The factory transported a physical sample back from the construction site, and the factory director and technicians gathered together to think of solutions. Deputy Director Zhao Pinzhen suggested using a punching machine to punch the pipe holes for the heat sink, but the thickness of the steam pipes varied. When Cui Rongshan saw that the factory director had come up with an idea, he also came up with a solution, using a winch to straighten the steam pipes. They successfully trial-produced the combined heating machine in just twenty days.
    Due to the employees' courage and determination in manufacturing new products, the factory's production developed rapidly. Now the number of employees has increased from more than twenty to more than seven hundred. By the end of November this year, the factory had already turned over 220,000 yuan in profits to the state. The state's investment was recovered in the same year.

    一个勤俭起家的工厂
    新华社记者　陶肃琦
    一座以少量的投资和半年多的时间建设起来的机械厂——齐齐哈尔市机械厂，已经生产出锅炉、卷扬机、联合采暖设备等二十多种机械设备。这些产品受到了不少国营工厂和建设工地的一致赞扬。
    走进这座工厂，人们就会被职工们克勤克俭办企业的艰苦朴素作风所感动。四个厂房中，有三个是利用被服厂的大仓库改造成的。新建的铆锻厂房的房盖是用旧仓库里的地板做的。厂房里的设备，都是国营工厂舍弃不用的三、四十年以前的老机床。这个厂仅有的新设备是高大的冲天化铁炉、梁式吊车和滚压机，这些设备都是这个厂职工们在今年3月份建厂以后，自己制造出来的。改建和新建的厂房都很经济实用。厂房四周装着暖气设备，房架添上了坚固的铁架，地板是用板皮锯成的木块组成的，厂房之间都有轻便铁道相连接，铸造厂房还安装了架空吊车，工人们在这里工作很舒适。这里唯一感到简陋的是厂长办公室，它设在一个小平房里，房间里没有暖气设备，也没有粉刷过，天花板是在最近才用旧报纸糊起来的。
    今年2月间，齐齐哈尔市地方工业局把建设这个厂的任务交给几个工人出身的工业干部。他们开始认为要建设一个供应国营工厂、建设工地一部分机械设备和铸铁管的机械工厂，必须要建得像样一些。初步规划建这个厂要四十二万元投资，这个计划没有被批准，国家只批给了十七万五千元投资。但是大家建厂的劲头很足，决定尽量利用和发挥国家的资金和拨给的房屋、呆滞设备，用勤俭起家、自力更生的方法，把工厂办起来，满足经济建设的需要。
    3月1日，钳工出身的副厂长吴正华带领着二十多个职工，开始了建厂工作。他们一部分是机械工人，一部分是已经停产的碱厂的编余人员。
    工厂的土木建筑工程和设备安装都是由工厂职工来担当，他们边学边做，很爱护国家的资财。职工们开始拆卸仓库地板的时候，因为地板钉得很牢，一块一块地起洋钉，把地板拆得很碎，只能当劈柴。职工们想：把它完整地拆下，倒可以做很好的房盖。他们按照新造厂房图纸尺寸，把整片地板割成几个大方块，移出来给新厂房作房盖。职工们建厂的热情非常高，都主动地为工厂找寻价廉物美的建筑材料，像变电所用的电气材料、建筑木材、采暖器材、耐火砖等都是其他工厂企业的呆滞材料。
    5月份，这个厂的机械、铆锻等车间先后投入生产，开始为其他工厂、工地制造迫切需要的新装备。有一个建设工地要购置冬季施工需要的二十五台联合采暖机，要的急，技术困难问题很多。因为工厂设备老旧，技术力量薄弱，工厂技术股长崔荣山起先没有信心。工厂从工地运回了一台实样，厂长和技术人员围在一起想办法。副厂长赵品珍提出用冲压机来冲出散热片的管子孔，但是蒸汽管的粗细不一。崔荣山见厂长出了点子，也想出办法，把蒸汽管用卷扬机拉直。他们只用二十天时间就把联合采暖机试制成功了。
    这座工厂的职工由于勇往直前地制造新产品，工厂生产发展很快，现在职工人数已经从二十多人增加到七百多人。到今年11月底止，工厂上缴国家的利润已经有二十二万元。国家的投资，当年就收回来了。
