Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 26th: This year, twenty farms in Guangdong Province have achieved an average yield of over a thousand jin per mu for double-cropping rice. The Fucheng Demonstration Farm in Lingshan County even had two mu and three fen of double-cropping rice averaging 1,982 jin per mu.

These farms are distributed across sixteen counties in the province, including plains, mountainous areas, and Hainan Island. Their land is generally not considered good; some farms even have poor and highly acidic soil. For example, the farmland of the Fucheng Demonstration Farm in Lingshan County was originally a very infertile, low-yielding area, with an annual yield of only about 200 jin. During the land reform, farmers disliked this land and were unwilling to take it. Due to the farm's soil improvement, increased fertilizer application, adoption of improved rice varieties, and implementation of advanced cultivation techniques centered on small-bunch close planting, this year, the 170 mu of double-cropping rice achieved an average yield of 1,135 jin per mu, about twice as high as the general yield of nearby agricultural cooperatives.

These farms have also generally reduced costs, achieving a surplus in operation. They also supply local agricultural cooperatives with a large amount of improved rice and technical crop varieties, and impart advanced technology, earning praise from farmers.

A total of more than one hundred demonstration and experimental farms in various counties of Guangdong Province (plus some branch farms in counties, totaling about 140 farms) have achieved increased production this year, playing a demonstrative role in promoting improved varieties and advanced technologies.

This newspaper reports: According to the Guangxi Daily, farms in six counties in Guangxi—Yulin, Luchuan, Rongxian, Guiping, Bobai, and Beiliu—overcame the threat of drought and achieved a large-area bumper harvest of rice with an average yield of over 1,000 jin per mu. Among them, the Luchuan Farm, with the highest yield, achieved an average yield of 1,386.5 jin on its 69 mu of double-cropping rice, with more than 6 mu yielding as high as over 1,770 jin. The average yield increased by 57% compared to last year and doubled compared to when the farm was established in 1953.

One of the experiences of high yield is the full implementation of deep plowing. The fields of the six farms were plowed deeper year by year using new-style walking plows or double-wheel double-share plows on the basis of the original three or four inches deep plowing. Now the soil is generally five inches deep, and some are seven inches deep. Winter plowing and sun-drying result in better seedling growth. Selecting high-yield varieties also plays an important role in achieving high yields. The Yulin Shinan Farm selects improved varieties that are more adapted to soil properties based on various soil types. This farm divides the fields into three categories: fertile fields are planted with the "Dwarf Sticky" improved variety, which has strong tillering ability and does not lodge; the second category is planted with "Summer Solstice White"; and the third category is planted with "Cut-Head White."

Secondly, all farms use farm manure. Farm manure is mainly based on pig raising and manure accumulation. The Shinan Farm has one pig per mu of land and also applies a large amount of pond manure and green manure. According to the experience of the Guiping Farm, fields planted with green manure can increase rice production by 83 jin compared to fields not planted with green manure. The Luchuan Farm also rotates rice and taro on one-third of the land to improve the soil. In addition, the experience of these farms proves that appropriate close planting and reasonable phased fertilization are good experiences for increasing production.

    广东广西出现二十六个“千斤农场”
    真正起了示范作用　得到农民一致好评
    新华社广州26日电　广东省今年出现了二十个平均每亩双季稻产量一千斤以上的农场。灵山县附城示范农场并且有两亩三分双季稻平均每亩产到一千九百八十二斤。
    这些农场分布在全省平原、山区和海南岛等地的十六个县。它们的土地一般都不算好，一部分农场还是土壤瘦瘠和酸性很重的土地。如灵山县附城示范农场的耕地原来是很瘦瘠的低产地，常年产量只有二百斤左右。土地改革的时候，农民嫌这些土地不好，不愿意要。由于这个农场改良土壤，增加肥料，采用水稻良种，实行以小科密植为中心的先进耕作技术，今年一百七十亩双季稻平均每亩产量达到一千一百三十五斤，比附近农业社一般产量约高了一倍。
    这些农场还普遍地降低了成本，做到经营上有盈余，它们并且大量供给当地农业社水稻和技术作物良种，传授先进技术，获得农民的好评。
    广东省各县共有一百多个示范试验农场（加上一些县的分场共约一百四十个场），今年大部分获得了增产，起了推广良种和先进技术的示范的作用。
    本报讯　据广西日报报道：广西玉林、陆川、容县、桂平、博白、北流等六个县的农场，战胜了干旱的威胁，获得每亩平均产量一千斤以上的大面积水稻丰产。其中产量最高的陆川农场，全场六十九亩双季稻，平均产量达到一千三百八十六斤半，有六亩多产量高至一千七百七十多斤。平均比去年增产57％，比1953年建场时增产一倍。
    丰产的经验之一是全部实行深耕。六个农场的田在原来犁三、四寸深的基础上，用新式步犁或双轮双铧犁逐年深耕。现在田土一般有五寸深，有的有七寸深。翻晒过冬的则禾苗生长得更好。选择高产品种，对丰产也起着重要作用。玉林石南农场分别各种土壤，选种更适应土壤性质的良种。这个场分三类田：一类的肥田种分蘖力强和不倒伏的“矮仔粘”良种，二类的种“夏至白”，三类的种“齐头白”。
    其次，各场都采用农家肥。农家肥又以养猪积肥为主。石南农场一亩田一头猪，又大量施用凼肥和种绿肥。据桂平农场的经验，种过绿肥的田比不种绿肥的田可增产稻谷八十三斤。陆川农场还用水稻与芋头在三分之一的田上进行轮栽，改良土壤。另外，这些农场的经验证明：适当密植、分期合理施肥等都是增产的良好经验。
