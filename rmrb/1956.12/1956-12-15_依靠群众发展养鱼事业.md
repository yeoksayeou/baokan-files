The Ministry of Aquatic Products Holds a Meeting
Determines the Guiding Principles for Fry and Fingerling Work
    The Ministry of Aquatic Products recently held its first fry and fingerling conference in Beijing.

    The conference focused on discussing issues such as organizing fry and fingerling production, strengthening production management, and tapping production potential. It also arranged the 1957 fry production and sales plan. Twenty-seven representatives from key production and sales provinces and cities attended the meeting.

    The meeting considered that significant achievements had been made in fry and fingerling production in recent years. This year, the national fry production reached 12.65 billion, an increase of 45% compared to 1952. Fingerling production has also developed accordingly. The meeting pointed out that since the upsurge of agricultural cooperation throughout the country, fish farming production has been universally carried out in various places. Guaranteeing the supply of fry is the material foundation for promoting fish farming, and it is also the primary key to developing freshwater fisheries at present.

    The conference determined that the current guiding principle for fry and fingerling work is to vigorously develop fry production, expand breeding varieties, utilize local materials, release fry locally, actively improve technology, and strive to improve the survival rate of fry and fingerlings and reduce costs.

    Everyone believes that in the future, fry and fingerling production should closely rely on agricultural and fishery cooperatives, leading and helping them to develop fry and fingerling production. State-owned fish farms should play a demonstrative role and guide mass production. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Shanxi Province Builds Many Fish Farms

    Fish farming in Shanxi Province has been gradually developing in recent years. Huyan, Zhangcun, and Yangjia Village on the west bank of the Fenhe River in the suburbs of Taiyuan City, and Sier Village in Datong City, etc., have used barren beaches, stagnant water pits, and dry canals to build two fish farms with an area of ​​approximately 600 mu. Fish farms have also been built in Qingxu, Xinjiang, and other places.

    These fish farms have already achieved some results. For example, the output of the state-owned Taiyuan Fish Farm has increased year by year, supplying 200,000 catties of fresh fish to the market in the past four years. The state-owned Datong Fish Farm supplied more than 3,000 catties of fresh fish to consumers during this year's National Day. Some agricultural cooperatives and farms in Qingxu, Xinjiang, and other counties have released more than 1 million fry this year. It is estimated that 120,000 catties of fresh fish can be produced next year.

    In the past, the fish needed in various parts of Shanxi were transported from other places, which was not only expensive but also small in quantity, and consumers often could not eat fresh fish.

    Hubei Expands Mass Fish Farming Area

    According to recent statistics from the Hubei Provincial Aquatic Products Department, the province's farmers and fishermen have reached more than 900,000 mu of fish farming area this year, more than three times the size of last year. The western and northern Hubei regions, which have historically had no fish farming habits due to traffic and technical constraints, have also begun to develop fish farming as a sideline this year.

    Hubei Province is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, with a mild climate and numerous lakes, ponds, and dikes. After the realization of agricultural and fishery cooperation throughout the province, farmers and fishermen in various places have mostly expanded or started operating this fish farming sideline, which requires little investment and yields high returns, based on local conditions. In order to support mass fish farming, a total of 106 new and expanded state-owned fry farms have been built throughout the province this year, supplying the masses with a large number of high-quality fry in a timely manner.

    依靠群众发展养鱼事业
    水产部召开会议
    确定鱼苗鱼种工作方针
    水产部最近在北京召开了第一次鱼苗鱼种会议。
    这次会议着重讨论了组织鱼苗鱼种生产、加强生产管理、发掘生产潜力的问题，并且安排了1957年鱼苗产销计划等工作。参加会议的有各重点产销省市代表二十七人。
    会议认为，近年来在鱼苗鱼种生产工作上已经取得了不少成绩。今年全国鱼苗产量达到一百二十六亿五千万尾，比1952年增长45％；鱼种生产也相应地有了发展。会议指出，自从全国农业合作化高潮以来，各地普遍开展养鱼生产，保证鱼苗的供应是促进养鱼事业的物质基础，也是当前发展淡水渔业的首要关键。
    会议确定当前鱼苗鱼种工作的方针，是大力发展鱼苗生产，扩大养殖品种，就地取材，就地放养，积极改进技术，力争提高鱼苗鱼种成活率，降低成本。
    大家认为，今后鱼苗鱼种生产应当紧密地依靠农渔业合作社，领导和帮助它们发展鱼苗鱼种生产。国营鱼场应该起示范和指导群众生产的作用。　（新华社）
    山西省兴建许多养鱼场
    山西省养鱼业近年来正逐步发展起来。太原市郊汾河西岸的呼延、张村、杨家村和大同市的寺儿村等地，已利用荒滩、死水坑和干渠，修建成了面积约六百余亩的两座鱼场，在清徐、新绛等地，也分别兴建了鱼场。
    这些养鱼场已经取得了一些成绩。如国营太原鱼场，产量逐年增加，四年来供给市场二十万斤鲜鱼。国营大同鱼场，今年国庆节向消费者供应了三千多斤鲜鱼。清徐、新绛等县一些农业社和农场经营的鱼场，今年已放养鱼苗一百万多尾。据估计，明年可产十二万斤鲜鱼。
    过去山西各地所需要的鱼，都是从外地运来，不仅费用大，而且数量少，消费者经常吃不到鲜鱼。

    湖北群众养鱼面积扩大
    据湖北省水产部门最近统计，全省农民和渔民今年养鱼面积达到九十多万亩，比去年扩大了三倍多。历来由于交通和技术条件限制而没有养鱼习惯的鄂西鄂北地区，今年也开始发展了养鱼副业。
    湖北省地处长江中流，境内气候温和，湖泊塘堰众多，全省实现农业和渔业合作化以后，各地农民和渔民大都根据本地条件把这种投资少、收益大的养鱼副业扩大或者开始经营起来。为了支持群众养鱼，今年全省共新建和扩建了一百零六个国营鱼种场，及时供应群众大批的优良鱼种。　（新华社）
