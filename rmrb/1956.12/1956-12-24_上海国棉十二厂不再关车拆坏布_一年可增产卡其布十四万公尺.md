Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 23rd—State-owned Shanghai No. 12 Cotton Mill has changed its long-standing practice of shutting down machines and tearing out bad fabric on the looms. Based on mobilizing workers to actively prevent the production of bad fabric, they have implemented a new measure of not tearing out any bad fabric. After testing, this method has proven to be very effective. According to calculations, the entire factory can produce more than 140,000 meters of khaki fabric per year by reducing downtime losses, increase profits submitted to the state by more than 356,000 yuan, and at the same time reduce the labor intensity of workers.

Before fully implementing the no-tear-out policy, the factory first implemented many technical measures in related processes such as spinning, weaving preparation, sizing, and loom maintenance to reduce the production of bad fabric from multiple perspectives. Weaving machine operators have also been freed from the heavy labor of inspecting the fabric surface, allowing them to spend more time cleaning the looms and inspecting warp yarn spools, etc., to prevent bad fabric from being produced in the first place. The factory focused on promoting this system from March 22nd and fully implemented it on April 16th. So far, the factory's finished second-grade cloth has not increased, and production and quality plans have been completed very well, with first-class and top-quality cloth consistently remaining around 99%. At the same time, because it is no longer necessary to tear out bad fabric, workshops have also transferred thirty-nine workers originally engaged in tearing out bad fabric to support other departments.

Originally, all weaving factories had workers specifically assigned to tear out bad fabric. When a weaving machine operator discovered bad fabric being produced, as long as it did not exceed nine inches (some factories used twelve or fourteen inches), the worker responsible for tearing out bad fabric would shut down the loom and re-weave the bad fabric section after removing the weft yarns. This method of tearing out bad fabric not only wasted a lot of labor and cotton yarn, but also, the re-woven fabric often became unevenly dyed second-grade cloth at the printing and dyeing factory due to the fuzzy surface, forcing the printing and dyeing factory to cut it off for sale or sell it at a reduced price. Shanghai No. 12 Cotton Mill conducted a survey: in March of this year, the factory's four weaving workshops, with more than 1,300 looms, tore out bad fabric 2,671 times. Calculating an average of half an hour of downtime and 4.2 inches of fabric removed per instance, the total downtime for the month was 6,335 machine hours, and more than 53,000 inches of fabric were removed. During that month, more than 20 looms in the workshops were frequently stopped for the purpose of tearing out bad fabric, and even the production plan was almost not completed. The printing and dyeing factory frequently called to complain about the excessive number of tear marks and poor quality of the gray fabric supplied to them.

The reform at Shanghai No. 12 Cotton Mill is a bold attempt for weaving factories. Relevant departments are studying their experience.

### 上海国棉十二厂不再关车拆坏布  一年可增产卡其布十四万公尺

    上海国棉十二厂不再关车拆坏布
    一年可增产卡其布十四万公尺
    新华社上海23日电　国营上海第十二棉纺织厂改变了实行已久的在布机上关车拆坏布的办法，他们在动员职工积极防止出坏布的基础上实行了全部不拆坏布的新措施。经过试验，这种办法效果很好。据计算，全厂因为减少停车损失，一年能多生产十四万多公尺卡其布，增加三十五万六千多元上缴利润，同时还减轻了工人的劳动强度。
    这个厂在全面实行不拆坏布以前，首先在纺纱、织布准备、浆纱和布机保全等有关工种方面，实行了很多技术措施，从多方面设法减少出坏布。织布挡车工也从繁重的检查布面的劳动中解脱出来，多做布机清洁工作，多检查经纱盘头等等，在坏布产生之前就及时设法防止。这个厂从3月22日重点推行这个制度，4月16日全面实行。到现在为止，全厂的成品次布并没有增加，产量、质量计划都完成得很好，上等布和一等布始终在99％上下。同时，由于不用再拆坏布，各车间还抽出了三十九个拆坏布工人支援其他部门。
    原来，所有织布工厂都专门设有拆坏布的工人。当挡车工发现织出坏布的时候，只要不超过九吋（有的厂是十二吋或十四吋），负责拆坏布的工人就要去关掉布机，把织坏的布面拆去纬纱重织。这种拆坏布的方法，不但浪费大量人工和棉纱，拆后重织的布到了印染厂里，还往往因为拆过的布面发毛等原因，被印染成为深浅不匀的次布，印染厂又不得不重新剪掉出售或是减价出售。第十二棉纺织厂做过调查：今年3月份，全厂四个织布车间的一千三百多台织机，共拆坏布二千六百七十一次，以每次停车半小时平均拆掉四点二吋布面计算，全月共停车六千三百三十五个台时，拆除布面五万三千多吋。这个月，车间里经常有二十多台织机为了拆坏布停止生产，连产量计划也几乎完不成；印染厂还时常来电话责备他们供给的坯布拆痕太多，质量太坏。
    第十二棉纺织厂的改革，是织布工厂一项大胆的尝试。有关部门正在研究他们的经验。
