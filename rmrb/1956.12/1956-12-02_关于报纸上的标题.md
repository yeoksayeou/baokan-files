　　On Newspaper Headlines
　　Yuming
    I deeply feel that the headlines in our newspapers are not exciting enough. An old newspaperman sarcastically said, "Headlines are like noodles eaten by northerners, the more you pull, the longer they get."

    This is not a harsh statement. We don't need to go too far back; just looking at recent news reports on current affairs, some telegraphic dispatches have headlines as long as sixty-seven characters. Generally, even for telegraphic dispatches with relatively simple content, many headlines are more than fifteen or sixteen characters long. Concise and eye-catching headlines of four or five characters, or seven or eight characters, are rare.

    Liu Yuxi's "Inscription of the Simple Abode" is only eighty-one characters long in total. Wang Anshi's "Reading the Biography of Lord Mengchang" is ninety characters long. However, our long headlines stretch out in such a lengthy string, with a number of characters almost equal to the entire length of these short articles, which is quite alarming.

    I think of the headline as the face of the newspaper. Just like a person's features. A person with refined features looks energetic and soulful. Someone with furrowed brows and glaring eyes, or drooping and lifeless eyes, is repulsive or looks like a "dead soul," lacking vitality. Whether the headline in a newspaper is exciting and can "capture the spirit" is much the same as whether a person's features are refined or not. In "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," Guan Yu is described as having phoenix eyes and silkworm eyebrows. But to be honest, these types of eyebrows and eyes are not particularly attractive. If the headlines in newspapers were all made to look like Guan Yu's eyebrows and eyes, it wouldn't be very appealing.

    Headlines, especially those of major events, should become "topics" that are easy to say and remember. I remember during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, some titles of Xinhua News Agency editorials and Liberation Daily editorials are still hard to forget. Such as "See Who Owns the World Today" and "Carry the Revolution Through to the End." Headlines like these are not only easy to say and remember, but also have great encouraging power, making people feel invigorated and full of courage. Now some of our newspaper headlines are either rambling and drawn-out, or stiff and solemn, with an unpleasant appearance that one cannot bear to look at.

    "Words are concise but meaning is rich, events are near but the analogy is far," I think newspaper headlines should strive to achieve this, and not just be technicians who enlarge the font size of news leads. Jia Dao once didn't sleep all night for the sake of "pushing" and "knocking" in his poetry; Du Fu also wanted to "never stop until a line startles the world." News headlines, because of time constraints, certainly cannot be like poets writing poetry, but we should absorb their spirit of meticulous carving. Newspaper headlines should also strive to be filled with precious words, vibrant and colorful. Flipping news leads is not the way, and "pulling noodles" is even less so.

### 关于报纸上的标题

　　关于报纸上的标题
　　愚明
    我深深感觉到我们报纸上的标题有些太不精采。有一位老报人讽刺地说：“标题像北方人吃的拉面，越拉越长。”
    这话说得并不刻薄。情况不必扯得很远，就拿最近关于时事问题方面的新闻报道，有的一条电讯的标题即有六十七个字之多。一般内容比较简单的电讯，很多标题也在十五、六个字以上。简洁醒目的四五字、七八字的标题很少。
    刘禹锡的“陋室铭”全文共八十一个字。王安石的“读孟尝君传”，全文共九十个字。可是，我们的长标题，一标就是那么一长串，字数之多，几乎要等于这些简短文章的全文了，这不能不令人可畏。
    标题，我认为它是报纸的眉目。这正如一个人的眉目一样。眉目清秀的人，看了就会觉得他有精神，有魂灵。横眉竖眼的人，或者死眉坍眼的人，就会觉得他讨厌，或者像个“死魂灵”，没精打采。报纸上的标题，标得精采不精采，能不能“传神”，这跟人的眉目清秀不清秀，也大致一样。“三国演义”上描写关公是丹凤眼，卧蚕眉，其实说老实话，这种眉眼并不好看。报纸上的标题，如果都弄成关公的眉眼，也是不大美妙的。
    标题，特别是重大事情的标题，应该成为“话题”，使人念着顺口，记在心头。记得在抗日战争时期和解放战争时期，当时新华社的社论和解放日报的社论，有些标题至今还不容易忘掉。如“请看今日之域中，竟是谁家之天下”、“将革命进行到底”等等。像这样一类的标题，不仅念着顺口，容易记在心头，而且有极大的鼓舞力量，使人精神焕发，勇气百倍。现在我们报上有些标题，不是啰啰苏苏，拉拉扯扯，就是正襟危坐，道貌岸然，面目之可憎，使人不忍卒睹。
    “辞约而旨丰，事近而喻远”，我觉得报纸上的标题要下这样的苦功，而不能专作放大新闻导语字体的技师。贾岛作诗，曾经为了“推敲”二字一夜没有睡觉；杜甫作诗，又要“语不惊人死不休”。新闻的标题，因为受时间性的限制，当然不能像诗人作诗那样，但是他们那种精雕细刻的精神，我们则是应该吸取的。报纸上的标题，也应当努力作到字字珠玑，有声有色。翻版新闻导语不是办法，“拉面条”更不是办法。
