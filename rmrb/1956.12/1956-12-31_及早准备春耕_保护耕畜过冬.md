    Prepare for Spring Ploughing Early, Protect Livestock Through Winter
    Hope that areas with abundant hay will use surplus feed to support disaster areas.
    Currently, there is a severe shortage of livestock feed in disaster areas of Hebei Province. To protect livestock through the winter, people in disaster areas are trying every possible means. Recently, the Baoding Special District Office of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative also sent people to Shandong and other abundant production areas to find feed. They signed a contract with the Yuncheng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative for them to supply two million jin of hay. However, after the contract was signed, the Yuncheng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative suddenly changed its mind, saying that their superiors had notified them to stop purchasing hay because Yuncheng County lacked 100 million jin of firewood. The 100 million jin of hay that Yuncheng County has surplus this year is just enough to replace firewood, so it cannot be sold to other places. However, we believe that if Yuncheng County can find a way to use coal instead of hay as fuel, it will not only increase the income of local farmers, but also support our disaster areas. Because one jin of coal can replace three jin of hay, and the price of one jin of coal is similar to that of one jin of hay. At the same time, for the 100 million jin of hay that Yuncheng County may have a surplus of, the two million jin of hay that we want to buy is not a large amount. Therefore, we earnestly hope that they can sell the hay to us according to the contract and save some livestock in our disaster areas that are on the verge of death! Li Wenhuan and 3 others
    Dissuade Farmers from Indiscriminately Selling Draft Animals
    The Ganggou livestock market in Qinglong County, Hebei Province, which is near Jianchang County, Liaoning Province, has seen a significant increase in livestock transactions since October. From January to September, only over 500 head of livestock such as cattle, horses, mules, and donkeys were traded. In October alone, more than 370 head were traded, and in November, the market could trade more than 240 head at one fair. The livestock traded at each fair accounted for 95% of the amount on the market. Almost all livestock owned by individual farmers could be traded as soon as they were brought to the market, regardless of the price. And about 85% of the livestock on the market were owned by individual farmers.
    Most of the livestock on the market came from the Yaolugou area of Jianchang County. The reason for the sudden increase in the amount of livestock on the market in Ganggou, it is understood, is that some primary agricultural cooperatives in the Ganggou area near Jianchang County have most of their livestock owned by individual farmers. These farmers estimate that they will soon be transferring to advanced cooperatives, and if they do not sell their livestock as soon as possible, they will belong to the advanced cooperatives. It is said that Jianchang County District has also tried to stop this situation, but many people with livestock are still secretly selling them to the outside. If effective measures are not taken in time to stop this situation, it will have a great impact on agricultural production in Jianchang County next year. Therefore, it is suggested that the relevant departments in Jianchang County quickly find ways to dissuade farmers from indiscriminately selling draft animals. Li Zhanen
    What is the reason for the large number of deaths of draft cattle in Le'an County?
    Many agricultural cooperatives in Le'an County, Jiangxi Province, have done a very poor job in the feeding and management of draft cattle, resulting in the continuous death of draft cattle. In Raofang Agricultural Cooperative, Bashang Township, nine cattle, large and small, have died of illness or been killed by tigers in the last two months; in Gaogao Agricultural Cooperative, Wutou Township, five cattle died in five days, an average of one death per day, including two calves that were starved to death because they were unattended. Similar situations also exist in some other agricultural cooperatives.
    The reasons for this phenomenon are: on the one hand, some members lack the idea of "loving the cooperative as their home" and do not take good care of the livestock in the cooperative. They say, "It doesn't matter if they die. The cattle that have entered the cooperative are not mine anyway." On the other hand, some specific problems are not handled properly. For example, the Shandong Agricultural Cooperative rents a member's cowshed and only gives one yuan rent per year. If the cowshed is broken, the member has to repair it himself. Therefore, some members are unwilling to rent out their cowsheds.
    It is suggested that agricultural cooperatives in various places strengthen the education of collectivism among their members, mobilize members to protect livestock well, and also study and solve some specific problems - such as cowshed rent.

    Don't let livestock spend the winter in the open air
    Since the beginning of winter, the death of draft animals in some agricultural cooperatives in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, has been very serious.
    After agricultural cooperation, there are many tasks in agricultural cooperatives, and draft animals are used intensively. In addition, some cooperatives do not manage the feeding well, and the draft animals are already very weak. Now it is the cold winter, and some agricultural cooperatives still lack sheds and pens, and a large number of livestock have to be placed in the open air; there are also some livestock that are scattered everywhere and no one manages them; therefore, phenomena such as livestock freezing to death, getting lost, and female livestock having abortions occur frequently. For example, the young livestock of the Jinbu Agricultural Cooperative have been running around without sheds and pens, and five calves have been eaten by wolves; the eighth production team of the Songjiang Cooperative had five mares abort their foals; the livestock farm of the National Friendship Cooperative in Wulin Township lost more than 3,000 yuan, mainly due to the loss and death of draft animals.
    Many agricultural cooperatives have formulated some systems on how to protect draft animals through the winter, but few people care about how these systems are implemented. In fact, it is easy for agricultural cooperatives to get some wood and straw to build some simple sheds and pens, which is much better than letting livestock spend the winter in the open air. Therefore, it is hoped that all places will pay attention to this issue and do a good job in protecting livestock.

### 及早准备春耕　保护耕畜过冬

    及早准备春耕　保护耕畜过冬
    希望谷草多的地区用多余的饲草支援灾区
    目前河北省灾区的牲畜饲草极感缺乏，为了保护牲畜安全过冬，灾区人民想尽了一切办法。最近河北省供销合作社保定专区办事处还派人到山东等丰产地区去找饲草，同郓城县供销社签订了一个由他们供应二百万斤谷草的合同，可是合同签订后，郓城县供销社突然变了卦，说是上级通知他们停止收购谷草，原因是郓城县缺少烧柴一亿斤，郓城县今年所富余的一亿斤谷草，刚好可以顶柴烧，所以不能再卖给外地。但是，我们认为如果郓城县能够设法用煤代替谷草作燃料，不但可以增加当地农民的收入，而且也支援了我们灾区。因为一斤煤可以顶三斤谷草用，而一斤煤同一斤谷草的价格也相差不多。同时，对于郓城县可能富余的一亿斤谷草来说，我们所要购买的二百万斤谷草，数目也不算大，所以我们恳切地希望他们能按合同把谷草卖给我们，救救我们灾区濒于死亡的一些牲畜！　　李文焕等四人
    劝阻农民滥卖耕牛
    临近辽宁省建昌县的河北省青龙县干沟牲畜市场，从10月份以来牲畜成交量大大增加，在1到9月份，成交牛、马、骡、驴等牲畜仅有五百多头，10月份一个月就成交三百七十多头，11月份，这个市场一个集就能成交二百四十多头。每个集成交的牲畜占上市量的95％。农民个人所有的牲畜，只要赶到市场上来，几乎全部能成交，不管贵贱都要卖掉。而上市的牲畜，约有85％都是农民个人所有的。
    上市的这些牲畜，绝大部分是从建昌县要路沟一带赶来的。干沟市场牲畜上市量突然增加的原因，据了解是建昌县靠近干沟一带，还有些农业初级社的大部分牲畜归农民个人所有。这些农民估计到快要转高级社了，如不把牲畜尽速卖掉，就要归高级社了。据说，建昌县区也曾设法制止这种情况，但是，许多有牲畜的人仍然偷偷地向外出卖。这种情况如不及时采取有效措施加以制止，对建昌县明年农业生产的影响是很大的。因此，建议建昌县有关部门迅速设法劝阻农民滥卖耕牛。　　李占恩
    乐安县耕牛大批死亡的原因何在？
    江西省乐安县有不少农业社对耕牛的饲养管理工作做得很差，造成耕牛不断死亡。坝上乡饶坊农业社，在最近两个月病死和被老虎咬死大小牛九头；芜头乡高潮农业社五天中死了五头牛，平均每天死一头，其中有两头小牛是无人看管活活饿死的。类似情况，在其他一些农业社里也有。
    产生这种现象的原因：一方面是有些社员缺乏“爱社如家”的思想，不好好饲养社里的牲畜，他们说，死了算了，入了社的牛反正不是自己的。另一方面，是处理一些具体问题不当。如山砀农业社租一个社员的牛栏，一年才给一元钱租金，牛栏破了，还由社员自己修。因此，有些社员就不愿意把自己的牛栏租出来。
    建议各地农业社加强对社员的集体主义思想的教育，动员社员们都来好好保护牲畜，同时也应针对一些具体问题——比如牛栏租金等问题，加以研究，快些解决。

    别让牲畜在露天里过冬
    入冬以来，吉林省蛟河县有些农业社的耕畜死亡现象十分严重。
    农业合作化后，农业社里的活计多，对耕畜使的紧，再加上有些社里饲养管理不善，耕畜已经很瘦弱。现在又正是寒冬，有些农业社里还少棚无圈，大批的牲口只好放在露天里；还有一些牲口到处散放，没人管理；因此牲畜冻死、丢失和母畜流产等现象不断发生。如进步农业社的幼畜由于没有圈棚到处乱跑，已被狼吃掉了五个牛犊；松江社第八生产队一个队就有五个母马掉了驹；乌林乡民族友谊社的牧畜场赔钱三千多元，主要是由于耕畜丢失和死亡造成的。
    怎样保护耕畜过冬的问题，不少农业社都订过一些制度，但是，这些制度执行得怎样，很少有人过问。其实，农业社弄些木头和秸棵，搭一些简易的圈棚，还是容易办到的，这样总比让牲口在露天里过冬好得多。因此希望各地重视这个问题，切实作好保护牲畜的工作。
