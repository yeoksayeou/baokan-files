    Nursing Science and Nursing Work
    Wang Lizhang, Li Yixiu
    It has only been in the last hundred years that nursing work has become a scientific profession in the field of medicine.
    In traditional Chinese medicine, great importance is attached to the nursing of patients. The saying "three parts treatment, seven parts nursing" is a well-known proverb. It also emphasizes entrusting the responsibility of patient care to those closest to the patient.
    The development of nursing science has progressed with the development of sciences such as medicine, hygiene, psychology, and education. Advances in medical science promote the progress of nursing science. Since the nineteenth century, the development of bacteriology, anesthesia, and surgery in medicine, as well as the discovery of X-rays and radium, have increased the scientific and technical requirements for nursing work. Advanced medicine, biology, and psychology have provided important materials for nursing science, proving that the biological body and mind are a complete and unified whole, illustrating the enormous impact of living conditions on patients, and enriching the content of nursing work.
    In addition, the development of nursing science is also greatly influenced by social systems. In advanced countries, there are protective measures for workers' labor, health education for children, home visits for pregnant and postpartum women, and widespread emphasis on improving environmental hygiene. This allows nursing work to be expressed not only in wards and hospitals but also more broadly in public health activities.
    In terms of nurse education, new content is gradually increased and improved according to actual needs. Due to the improvement of medicine, nursing work has been led onto a scientific path.
    The object of nursing work is people. People are complex, with different ages, constitutions, personalities, living habits, cultural levels, economic conditions, and life experiences. Diseases are also complex, with various different situations in terms of diagnosis, stage, severity, treatment methods, and prognosis. To make healthy people understand disease prevention and health care methods, and to make sick people recover quickly, simple methods alone cannot achieve effective results.
    Suppose a three-year-old child and several adults all have pneumonia. The differences in doctors' diagnostic methods and treatments may not be significant, but the nursing requirements are very different. A three-year-old child will pull out the oxygen tube himself, avoid and cry during injections, and refuse to stay in bed as soon as the fever goes down. These problems all need to be solved by nurses. Adults, also, precisely because of differences in age, culture, life, and constitution, will have different reactions to various treatments and different requirements for living care.
    To do nursing work well and know what to do, nurses must master the scientific theories of both "people" and "disease," that is, they must master the theories of psychology, education, and medicine in order to apply them to nursing methods and techniques.
    To give a few simple examples, "helping patients turn over" is a common task, but different methods should be adopted according to different conditions. When moving paralyzed limbs, the joints at both ends should be supported to prevent muscles from being accidentally injured, which would delay or affect recovery. For patients with arthritis, the joints should not be gripped when moving them, but the ends of the joints must be supported, lifted and placed gently. Even with the same arthritis, different nursing methods should be adopted when there are different pathological changes. For example, in rheumatic arthritis, the joints will not change after the inflammation subsides. Therefore, when placing the limbs, any posture that the patient feels comfortable with can be adopted. However, for rheumatoid arthritis, the same method should not be adopted, otherwise disability is inevitable. Because in this type of arthritis, connective tissue will proliferate, and the joints may stiffen after the inflammation subsides. If the posture is not in accordance with scientific requirements, there will be many inconveniences in the future.
    For a patient with insomnia, taking sleeping pills is not the best treatment. If the nurse can make the environment dark and quiet, soak his feet in hot water for a while, drink a cup of mild and non-irritating beverage, and then wipe his back with hot water and massage it well, the patient can often sleep better than taking sleeping pills, because these measures can cause mild cerebral anemia, relieve muscle tension, increase comfort, and quickly bring the patient into physiological sleep.
    Feeding is not a profound technique, but if the nurse does not elevate the patient's head a little, choking is inevitable. If the nurse does not understand the patient's eating habits and only feeds according to his/her own method, it will not easily arouse the patient's appetite and cannot guarantee the patient's food intake. If the nurse does not first teach a patient lying in an iron lung to swallow during exhalation, the food will be inhaled into the trachea, causing coughing and choking, and in severe cases, it can lead to pneumonia.
    If a premature baby weighing 600 grams was not cared for by a nurse who mastered his characteristics, preventing him from being infected and wasting energy, it would be impossible to guarantee his nutrition and warmth and enable him to survive. Insufficient attention to even a small matter such as changing diapers for a newborn can cause diaper rash and erosion.
    Death is one of the inevitable processes of life, and nurses in hospitals will inevitably encounter some patients who cannot be saved. Since there is no hope for life, it is the nurse's great responsibility to make the last period of life as comfortable and peaceful as possible. For a patient who has already contracted an inoperable cancer, it is not a simple matter to help him have the courage to face the facts and live, and to encourage him to actively contribute his last strength to society. It is also of great significance to persuade family members to suppress excessive grief and work together to help the patient pass away in peace and tranquility; and to help the living face death squarely, without regrets, and with less spiritual pain.
    In the process of life, as long as a person loses the ability to take care of himself, he must rely on nursing. Nurses turn ordinary work into good medicine through scientific selection and refinement, and apply it to people, so that it plays a role in prolonging life.
    The great spirit of maternal love is a unique style of nursing work. No matter how high the theoretical knowledge, no matter how skillful the technique, if the patient is not treated with the same heart as a mother cares for her children, the work cannot be done well.
    When a person gets sick, he has to rely on others for his daily life like a child. The temperament of sick people often tends to be depressed and irritable, the excitement and inhibition of emotions lose their normalcy, they cannot take care of themselves, and their thoughts and consciousness often cannot be well expressed. The environment of the ward is not like an office. Nurses have to contact things that ordinary people do not like to contact, tolerate what ordinary people find difficult to tolerate, understand what others cannot understand, and think of what others cannot think of; what people are afraid of being dirty, they must not be afraid of; what people dislike being troublesome, they must not be troublesome; what people are unwilling to do, they must be willing to do; and what difficulties people avoid, they must go to solve. Without the heart of a loving mother, such work is really difficult to be competent for.
    However, as a nurse, it is not enough to have only "love" without scientific principles. For a patient with appendicitis abdominal pain, if only the patient's request is followed, massaging or giving a hot water bag will cause trouble. During the recovery period of typhoid fever patients, giving too much food in order to satisfy their appetite will only cause them to relapse.
    Nurses have the responsibility of managing and educating patients. Nurses have the responsibility to introduce all the ward rules made for the collective interest to the patients, so that they can recognize their significance and consciously abide by them. Common sense of disease prevention and health care, and knowledge of fighting diseases should be promoted at every appropriate opportunity, so that patients can be like attending a health school after staying in the hospital. Therefore, the role of nurses is not limited to passive treatment, but also has a certain importance in active health care.
    Nursing science is a part of the entire medical science, and its development must be adapted to the development of medicine and the improvement of people's cultural life. If it lags behind, it will weaken the medical effect and cannot meet the needs of the people.
    When a new medical theory is researched, and a new therapy and surgery can be performed, it is a topic that should be closely followed and solved from the nurse's point of view: how to understand it, how to cooperate or implement it through nursing work, and how to ensure its effect. The application of isotopes in medicine, heart surgery, hypothermia anesthesia, new achievements in the etiology research of epidemic hemorrhagic fever and Kashin-Beck disease, short-term therapy for schistosomiasis, and the new application of traditional Chinese medicine experience all require nursing work to cooperate. Hospitalized patients are no longer satisfied with the level of nursing such as taking medicine and injections on time. They have put forward higher requirements for recuperation conditions, life arrangements, and acquisition of health care knowledge. Mothers hope to obtain knowledge of childcare, and children who are admitted to the hospital not only require treatment of their illnesses, but also require attention to education and upbringing issues and not to waste their studies. The principle of prevention first has determined the active role of treatment institutions in disease prevention and health care. Therefore, the requirements for nurses in clinical nursing, health publicity, and other aspects have also been further improved.
    To date, there are still many diseases for which there is no specific treatment. How to improve the quality of nursing so that it produces good results, how to shorten the course of the disease through nursing work, how to reduce the mental and physical pain of patients in the process of illness in addition to receiving treatment and taking medicine, and how to help patients fight against the disease all remain to be further studied.
    Nursing science is an applied science, which is closely related to national health care. The more nursing common sense that each person masters, the more guaranteed their health will be. Therefore, the development of nursing science should not only pay attention to improvement, but also pay attention to popularization, and should be listed as one of the main contents of improving people's cultural level. If everyone has some nursing common sense, then they will pay more attention to disease prevention and health care in daily life, and if they get sick and have to recuperate at home, the minor illness will not become a major illness due to improper care. Therefore, popularizing nursing science will play a great role in improving the nursing knowledge of the general public and improving the health level of the entire people.
    Since the establishment of New China, with the development of health and medical undertakings, nursing undertakings have been greatly strengthened. At present, there are more than 100 independent nurse education institutions and approximately 200,000 nursing personnel. Under the guidance of revolutionary humanitarianism and advanced medical ideology, nurses have made progress in ideology and work, and have made certain contributions to health undertakings. For example, the important improvements in the work of caring for mental patients and the achievements in the care of premature infants have been well received by the international medical community. In addition, methods such as painless injections, and a lot of nursing experience have been accumulated for diseases such as pneumonia and poliomyelitis in young children and children. China's social system and the development of health undertakings have created favorable conditions for nursing science and nursing work. However, today, the quality of nursing in various medical departments is not high, nurses are improperly used, and there are many medical accidents, which are not compatible with the requirements of patients and the requirements of the country. This situation is related to today's nurse education system, hospital system, and the incorrect views of many people on nursing science and nursing work, and insufficient support and care are given to nursing work under certain conditions, which must be urgently improved. At the same time, while improving the active measures of nursing work, it is also necessary to strengthen the ideological education of nursing personnel and give play to the enthusiasm of nursing workers in order to improve the level of nursing and to improve and popularize this science and technology.

    护理学与护士工作
    王立章　李懿秀
    护理工作在医学领域中成为一个科学的专业还是近一百年的事。
    在祖国医学里，很重视对病人的护理，所谓“三分治，七分养”是一句人人皆知的俗语；并且强调把病人的护理责任交给病人最亲近的人去做。
    护理学的发展是随着医学、卫生学、心理学、教育学等科学的发展而发展的。随着医学科学的进步，推动护理学的进步。十九世纪以来，医学方面的细菌学、麻醉法、外科学的发展，爱克斯射线和镭的发现，提高了对护理工作的科学技术要求。先进的医学、生物学和心理学更提供了护理学重要的材料，证明生物的肉体与精神是完整的统一的整体，说明生活条件对病人的巨大影响作用，丰富了护理工作的内容。
    此外，护理学的发展，也受着社会制度的很大影响。在先进的国家里，有对工人劳动的保护性措施，有对儿童的健康教育，有对孕产妇的访视保健，并广泛地重视环境卫生的改善，等等，这样使护理工作不仅表现在病房和医院里，而且更广泛地表现在公共卫生的活动方面。
    在护士教育方面，也随着实际的需要，逐步提高、逐步增加新的内容。由于医学的提高，把护理工作领上了科学的道路。
    护理工作的对象是人。人是复杂的，人们有着不同的年龄、体质、个性、生活习惯、文化水平、经济状况和生活经验。病也是复杂的，无论在诊断、病期、严重程度、医疗方法和愈后好坏上都有各种各样不同的情况。要使无病的人懂得防病保健的方法，要使有病的人赶快恢复健康，绝非简单的办法所能收效。
    假设一个三岁的小孩和几个成人都患了肺炎，在医生的诊断方法和治疗上的差别不大，但对护理上的要求就有很大的不同。三岁的孩子用氧气时自己会拔掉管子，注射时要躲避和哭闹，热度刚退下去就不肯在床上躺着，这些问题就都需要护士来解决。而成年人，也正因为年龄、文化、生活、体质等不同，而会对各种治疗的接受有不同的反应，对生活照顾会有不同的要求。
    要做好护理工作，要知所适从，
  护士必须掌握“人”与“病”两方
  面的科学理论，也就是说，必须掌握心理学、教育学和医学的理论，以便应用在护理方法和技巧上。
    举几个简单的例子来说，“帮助病人翻身”是件平凡的事，可是按照不同病情就要采取不同办法。搬动麻痹的肢体时，应该扶托两端的关节，使肌肉免受因意外损伤而延迟或影响恢复；对患有关节炎的病人，搬动时就不应该握住关节，一定要托住关节的两端，轻举轻放。同样是关节炎，可是有不同病理变化时就要采用不同的护理方法。例如风湿性关节炎，在炎症消退后关节不会有变化，因此安放肢体时，病人觉得怎样舒服就可以采取怎样的姿势；而对风湿样关节炎，若采取同样办法就难免不落下残废，因为患这种关节炎时结缔组织会增生，炎症消退后关节可能强直，如果放的姿势不合乎科学的要求，以后就会有许多不便。
    对一个失眠的病人，服安眠药并不是最好的治疗办法。若是护士能把环境弄得幽暗安静一点，给他用热水泡一会脚，饮一杯温和而没有刺激性的饮料，再用热水给他擦一擦背，很好地按摩几下，病人往往能比服安眠药睡得更香，因为这些措施能够引起轻度的脑贫血，解除肌肉的紧张，增加舒适感，能很快把病人引入生理睡眠。
    喂饭不是深奥的技术，但护士不把病人的头垫高一些，就难免不呛；不了解病人的饮食习惯，只随着自己的方法喂，就不易引起病人的食欲，不能保证病人的食量，躺在铁肺里的病人护士不先教会他在呼气动作时下咽，就会将食物吸入气管引起咳呛，严重的还会导致肺炎。
    一斤十二两的早产儿，若不是护士掌握了他的特点，使他不受感染、不浪费精力，便不可能保证他的营养、温暖，使他生活下来。新生儿在换尿布这样一件小事上的注意不够，就可能使他臀红糜烂。
    死亡是人生必经的过程之一，护士在医院里也不可免地会碰到一些无法挽救的病人。生已无望，怎样使人生最后的一段时间过得舒适一点、平安一点，对护士来说是有很大责任的。对一个已经得了无法割治的癌瘤患者，怎样帮助他有面向事实、生活下去的勇气，怎样鼓励他把最后一些力量再积极地贡献给社会，这不是一件简单的事。而怎样说服家属，抑制过度悲痛的情绪，共同努力使病人在平安宽怀的情况下离世；怎样帮助活着的人正视死亡，没有遗憾，精神上少受伤痛，更有其重要的意义。
    人在生活过程中，只要失去了自理能力的时候，就要依靠护理。护士就是要把平凡的工作经过科学的选择和提炼，变成了良医良药，应用到人身上，使它起着延年益寿的作用。
    伟大的母爱精神是护理工作特有的作风。理论知识无论多么高，技术无论多么巧，如果不能以母亲关怀子女一样的心情来对待病人，工作还是做不好的。
    人生了病，对自己的日常生活便要像小孩一样依赖于别人。有病的人的性情往往多趋于忧郁烦躁，感情的兴奋与抑制，失去常态，不能自理，思想和意识往往不能很好地表达。病房的环境不像办公室，护士要接触常人所不喜欢接触的，要忍耐常人所难于忍耐的，要体会别人所不能体会的，要想到别人所想不到的；人家怕脏的他要不怕，人家嫌烦的他要不烦，人家不肯做的事他要乐意地去做，人家躲避的困难他要去解决。若没有慈母一样的心，这样的工作实在是难于胜任的。
    可是作为一个护士，单有“爱”心而没有科学的原则也是不行的。阑尾炎腹痛的病人，如果只依病人的要求，按摩或给一个热水袋就闯了祸。伤寒病人恢复期，为了满足他的食欲，给予过多的食物也只会害他复发。
    护士对病人负有管理和教育的责任。护士有责任把所有的为了集体利益订出的一些病房制度介绍给病人，使他认识它的意义，自觉地遵守。对防病保健的常识、与疾病斗争的知识要抓住一切适当的机会进行宣传，使病人在住过医院之后，能够像上过一次卫生学校一样。因此护士的作用不仅限于消极的治疗，在积极的保健方面还有其一定的重要性。
    护理学是整个医学的一部分，它的发展必须与医学的发展和人民文化生活的提高相适应，如果落在后面，那么便减弱了医疗作用，也不能满足人民的要求。
    当一个新的医学理论被研究出来，一个新的疗法和手术可以施行时，从护士的角度应该怎样去了解，通过护理工作如何去配合或实施，如何保证它的效果，是一个应该紧跟着解决的课题。同位素在医学上的应用，心脏手术、低温麻醉、流行性出血热、大骨节病在病原研究上的新成就，血吸虫病的短程疗法以及祖国医学经验的新应用，都要求护理工作来配合。住院病人，已不再满足于按时吃药打针这样的护理水平，对休养条件、生活安排、保健知识的获得都提出了更高的要求。产妇希望得到育儿的知识，患儿住入医院后不但要求治好了病，还要求注意到教养问题和不使荒废学业。预防为主的方针确定了治疗机构对防病保健的积极作用，因此在临床护理、卫生宣传等方面对护士的要求也有了进一步的提高。
    到目前为止，还有许多疾病没有特效的疗法。如何把护理质量提高，使它产生良好的效果，如何通过护理工作缩短病程，使病人在病的过程中除了接受治疗、服药外，如何减少精神上肉体上的痛苦，并帮助病人向疾病作斗争等都有待于进一步的钻研。
    护理学是一门应用科学，与全民保健有着密切的关系，每一人掌握护理常识愈多，对健康就愈有保障，因此护理学的发展不但要注意提高，更应当重视普及，并且应当把它列为提高人民文化水平的主要内容之一。如果人人都有一些护理常识，那么在日常生活中就会更加注意防病保健，万一得了病而又必须在家调养时，也不至于因护理不当而使小病变大，因此普及护理学，对提高一般居民的护理知识，对提高全民的健康水平会起很大的作用。
    在新中国建立后，随着卫生医疗事业的发展，护理事业大大增强了。目前有独立的护士教育机构一百多处，护理人员约近二十万人。在革命的人道主义、先进的医学思想指导下，护士们无论在思想上、工作上都有了进步，给卫生事业以一定的贡献。如在护理精神病人工作上的重要改善，早产婴儿的护理成就，都获得国际医学界的好评。此外，如无痛注射方法，对幼儿、小儿肺炎和脊髓前灰质炎等病也积累了不少的护理经验。我国的社会制度和卫生事业的发展，给护理学和护士工作创造了优越的条件。但是，今天各医疗部门的护理质量不高，护士使用不当，医疗事故较多，这与病人的要求和国家的要求都不相适应。这种情况与今天的护士教育制度、医院制度，以及许多人对护理学和护士工作的不正确的看法有关，给护理工作一定条件的支持和照顾不够，必须急求改善。同时，在改善护理工作的积极措施的同时，也必须加强护理人员的思想教育，发挥护理工作者的积极性，才能提高护理水平，才能使护理这门科学技术得到提高和普及。
