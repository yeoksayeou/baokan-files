　　Popular Specialty Stores

　　This newspaper reports that Dalian has seen a succession of specialty stores this year – women's goods stores, children's goods stores, southern goods and food stores, live fish stores, etc. These specialty stores offer a wide variety of products, are better able to meet the needs of residents, and are deeply welcomed by consumers. The women's goods store is located on Tianjin Street, the commercial center of the city, and provides women with supplies for all seasons; clothing, knitwear, cosmetics, silk, and shoes alone account for more than 1,600 kinds of goods. The children's goods store sells everything for children from newborns to about fourteen years old, including clothing, things to wear, and things to play with; there are now more than 1,600 kinds of children's clothing, knitwear, shoes, and toys. The live fish store in the Dalian market has a transparent large fish pond as its counter, in which large carp, eels from Tianjin, live crucian carp, turtles, and catfish from Jinzhou and other places are raised. Customers want to buy which one, and the salesperson will catch that one for them. Dalian has many people from the South, and in order to enable them to eat local products from their hometowns, a southern goods and food store has been specially set up here. The store has widely solicited opinions from southerners, and purchasers have traveled all over the north and south of the Yangtze River to purchase more than 700 kinds of southern foods based on these opinions. Sichuan's white fungus, Hainan Island's white bird's nest, Hunan's bamboo shoots, Changzhou's dragon beard vegetables, etc., can all be bought here. Southerners feel very warm and happy when they see the local products from their hometowns that they have not been able to eat for a long time. People who have visited various cities in the Northeast believe that the commercial service work in Lushun-Dalian is better than in other cities in the Northeast. (Jin Yu Kun)
