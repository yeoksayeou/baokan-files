Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 27th: Since the implementation of the "Work Program for Improving Quality and Increasing Variety from 1956 to 1957," Tianjin's local industries have achieved significant results.

Out of the 404 products listed in the work program for the next two years by the Tianjin Municipal Industrial Bureaus, with the exception of 51 that were not produced, 193 products have reached the national standards, Soviet and People's Democratic countries' standards, or the advanced standards of similar domestic products in terms of quality. In 1956, it was originally planned to trial-produce 838 new products, but 1,333 were actually completed, of which 737 have already been put into production.

After the work program was officially announced by the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee in July, the industrial bureaus, industrial companies, and factories, based on the requirements of the program, separately mobilized workers to propose more than 1,800 technical measures to ensure the realization of the plan. As of November, more than 1,400 of these measures had been implemented.

In order to improve product quality, each industrial bureau has established a technical research institute, and each industrial company and large factory has also set up a central laboratory or testing station. These technical research institutions collected samples and quality standards of excellent products at home and abroad, assisted factories in trial-producing new products, and analyzed and compared the physical properties of more than 200 products produced in Tianjin, revising the quality standards. The industrial bureaus also sent many technicians and workers to advanced factories in Shanghai and other places to learn advanced experiences, and then organized professional meetings by industry to promote them; at the same time, they held more than 140 technical schools and technical training classes to improve the technical level of workers and technicians.

The Tianjin Municipal People's Committee held a reporting meeting from December 18th to 23rd to review the implementation of the two-year work program by the industrial bureaus. The meeting requested workers in all factories to guard against arrogance and rashness, and to continue to work hard next year to improve quality and increase variety, and to carry out the campaign to increase production and practice thrift, so that Tianjin's industrial products can achieve high quality and low prices.

    全面规划　认真执行
    天津地方工业品种增加质量提高
    新华社天津27日电　天津市地方工业自从贯彻执行1956年到1957年提高质量增加品种的工作纲要以来，已经获得很大成绩。
    天津市各工业局列入这两年工作纲要的四百零四种产品，除了五十一种没有生产以外，已经有一百九十三种产品质量达到了国家规定的标准、苏联和人民民主国家标准或国内同类型产品的先进标准。1956年原来规定试制八百三十八种新产品，实际完成了一千三百三十三种，其中有七百三十七种已经投入生产。
    这个工作纲要7月份由天津市人民委员会正式公布以后，各工业局、工业公司和工厂又根据纲要的要求，分别发动职工提出了保证实现规划的技术措施一千八百多项。到11月止，这些措施有一千四百多项已经实现。
    为了提高产品质量，各工业局都建立了技术研究所，各工业公司、大工厂也都设立了中心试验室或化验站。这些技术研究机构搜集了国内外优良产品的样品和质量标准，协助工厂试制新产品，并且对天津市生产的二百多种产品的物理性能进行分析、比较，修订了质量标准。各工业局还派出许多技术人员和工人到上海等地的先进工厂学习先进经验，然后按行业召开专业会议组织推广；同时举办了一百四十多个技术学校和技术训练班，以便提高工人和技术人员的技术水平。
    天津市人民委员会在12月18日到23日召开汇报会，检查了各工业局执行两年工作纲要的情况。会议要求各厂职工戒骄戒躁，明年继续努力提高质量增加品种，开展增产节约，使天津的工业品达到物美价廉。
