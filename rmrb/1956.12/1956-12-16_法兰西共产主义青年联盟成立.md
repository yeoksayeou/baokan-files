Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 14th. TASS reports: The founding congress of the French Communist Youth Union opened on December 14th in Ivry, a working-class district of Paris.

    Over a thousand delegates from all over the country are participating in the congress. The congress will adopt the program and charter of the French Communist Youth Union and elect leading bodies.

    Due to the French government's refusal to issue visas, representatives of youth organizations from the Soviet Union and various people's democracies who were invited to attend the congress were unable to do so.
