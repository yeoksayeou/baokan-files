　  CPC Dongxiang County Committee Changes Leadership Style
　　County Committee Members "Settle Down" Among the Masses

    (Our Dispatch) The CPC Jiangxi Province Dongxiang County Committee has changed its leadership style by starting with going deep into the grassroots, going deep among the masses, and conducting investigations and research.

    At the end of August this year, the County Committee decided to select thirteen County Committee members to "settle down, and move periodically" among the masses. For nearly two months, most of the County Committee members have been able to ensure that they spend two-thirds of their time in rural areas, and have respectively produced different investigation reports. Comrade Zhao Yingzhou, the Secretary of the County Committee, investigated "the changes in the economic situation of Laolouxia Village and the changes in living standards over the years" in Xiling Township, pointing out ways for the village to ensure that the masses increase production and income. Other County Committee members have also individually or jointly conducted investigations on "new situations and new changes after agricultural cooperativization," "class analysis," "production and distribution," and "democratic life within the Party and the ideological dynamics of Party members."

    Through going deep among the masses and conducting investigations and research, they have gained a greater understanding of the actual situation, and their guidance in work is generally more specific and clearer than in the past. The person in charge of the CPC Dongxiang County Committee said: In the past, when the County Committee held meetings to study work, it was often at a loss. Now, because they have grasped more factual materials, they can generally put forward proposals before the meeting, study them collectively at the meeting, and after the meeting, the County Committee members personally go down to arrange and inspect, beginning to reverse the working style of not understanding the situation below and simply sitting in the office giving orders.

　  中共东乡县委转变领导作风
　　县委委员到群众中“安家落户”
    本报讯　中共江西省东乡县委从深入基层、深入群众、进行调查研究着手，改变了领导作风。
    今年8月底，县委决定抽调十三名县委委员到群众中去“安家落户，定期迁移”。近两个多月来，大部县委委员能保证有三分之二的时间在农村，并分别作出了不同的调查报告。县委书记赵瀛洲同志在西岭乡，调查了“老楼下村经济情况变化和历年来生活水平变化的情况”，指出了该村保证群众增加生产、增加收入的门路。其他县委委员也分别或共同作了“农业合作化后新情况、新变化”、“阶级分析”、“生产和分配”、“党内民主生活和党员思想动态”等方面的调查。
    通过深入群众、调查研究，对实际情况有了更多的了解，在指导工作的时候，一般都比过去更具体更明确了。中共东乡县委负责人说：过去县委开会研究工作，常常茫无头绪。现在因为掌握了较多的实际材料，一般都能在会前提出方案，会上集中研究，会后，县委委员亲自下去布置、检查，开始扭转了那种不大了解下情，只是坐在机关里发号施令的工作作风。
