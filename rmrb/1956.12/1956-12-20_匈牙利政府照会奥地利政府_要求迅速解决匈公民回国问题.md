Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 19th: The Hungarian News Agency reported that on December 18th, the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the Austrian Embassy in Budapest, demanding a swift resolution to the issue of Hungarian citizens in Austria who wish to return home.

The note emphasized that the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs deeply regrets that the Austrian government and relevant authorities have not taken any measures to resolve the issue of the return of Hungarian citizens. Representatives of organizations from other countries, however, are able to receive assistance from the Austrian authorities and freely carry out activities in Austria to persuade thousands of Hungarians to go to other countries, even though, according to Austrian newspaper reports, a large number of them have expressed their willingness to return to Hungary.

The note further stated that due to the attitude of the Austrian government, the staff of the Hungarian Embassy in Vienna have not been able to obtain facilities to repatriate Hungarian citizens residing in refugee camps who wish to return home, and the activities of the Repatriation Administrative Committee in Austria have not been possible to carry out. The Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that this attitude of the Austrian official institutions is unwarranted. The note stated that the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in the most resolute manner, urges the Austrian government to pay attention to the situation of adolescents under the age of eighteen. Regarding the return of a large number of adolescents who went to Austria after the events of October 23rd, the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had already pointed this out in its note of November 28th. Unfortunately, the Austrian side has consistently failed to respond.

The Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterated that the Hungarian side has made every effort to facilitate the rapid return of minors to their families, and the Hungarian side also insists that the Austrian side promptly provide everything possible to enable minors to return to Hungary.

Finally, in the note, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested the Austrian Embassy to endeavor to draw its government's attention to the importance of the above-mentioned issues, because the rapid and active resolution of these issues is in accordance with the principles of international law and humanitarianism, and can contribute to the normal development of relations between the two neighboring countries.

    匈牙利政府照会奥地利政府
    要求迅速解决匈公民回国问题
    据新华社布达佩斯19日电　据匈牙利通讯社报道，匈牙利外交部12月18日向奥地利驻布达佩斯公使馆送了一份照会，要求迅速解决在奥地利的希望回国的匈牙利公民问题。
    照会着重指出，匈牙利外交部深为遗憾地看到奥地利政府和有关当局对解决匈牙利公民回国的问题还没有采取任何措施，而其他一些国家的组织的代表们却能够得到奥地利当局的帮助，在奥地利毫无困难地展开一切活动来劝说成千上万的匈牙利人到别的国家去，然而根据奥地利报纸的报道来看，他们中间很大一部分人是表示愿意返回匈牙利的。
    照会进一步说，由于奥地利政府的态度，匈牙利驻维也纳公使馆的工作人员未能获得便利来遣返住在各难民营里的愿意回国的匈牙利公民，而遣返行政委员会在奥地利的活动也没有可能展开；匈牙利外交部认为奥地利官方机构的这种态度是没有理由的。照会说，匈牙利外交部以最坚决的态度提请奥地利政府对十八岁以下的青少年的处境予以注意。关于在10月23日事件以后前往奥地利的一大部分青少年回国的问题，匈牙利外交部在11月28日的照会中就已经指出过。遗憾的是，奥地利方面始终没有答复。
    匈牙利外交部重申：匈牙利方面已经竭尽努力来便利未成年人尽速返回他们的家庭，匈牙利方面同时坚持要求奥地利方面迅速给予一切可能来使得未成年人能够回到匈牙利来。
    外交部最后在照会中请求奥地利公使馆竭力提请它的政府对上述问题的重要性予以注意，因为迅速而且积极地解决这些问题是符合国际法和人道主义的原则的，并且能够有助于两个邻国之间的关系的正常发展。
