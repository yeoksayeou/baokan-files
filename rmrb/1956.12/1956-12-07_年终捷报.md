Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, December 6th: The Luoyang Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction has completed the construction of sixteen large factory buildings this year. By the end of November, this engineering bureau had already exceeded its annual construction plan ahead of schedule. The Luoyang Engineering Bureau is responsible for the construction of key projects such as the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant and the Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant. This year, there were many construction projects, and most of them were large buildings with complex structures and strict technical requirements. In addition, there were constant material shortages and design changes during the construction process. Therefore, this year's construction task was completed under the conditions of improving enterprise management and overcoming many difficulties.

This year, the Luoyang Engineering Bureau took economic accounting as the center and led employees to carry out socialist competitions, which fully stimulated the production enthusiasm and creativity of employees. According to statistics, from January to October this year, the workers of the engineering bureau overfulfilled the state's quotas every month, with efficiency 8.3% higher than the state target and costs reduced by 14.38%.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 6th: As of the 5th, the Shanghai Railway Administration has overshipped more than 400,000 tons of cargo, completing this year's freight plan.

Since the beginning of this year, the railway administration has transported much more building materials, steel, wood, and coal than in the same period last year. The amount of agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers transported is also unprecedented.

This year, railway workers have expanded the promotion of methods such as matching light and heavy goods and multi-layer loading of livestock, so that each wagon averages more than two tons of cargo than last year. In the competition to haul more and run faster, train drivers have already run 8,074 over-axle trains this year, averaging 334 tons of cargo more than required per train.

This Newspaper Reported: The Caijiagang Machinery Factory, which specializes in producing various medium and small-sized winches for mining production, increased its production plan for this year compared with last year, but the annual plan was completed in mid-November. The factory has also formulated a plan to increase production and save money in the spirit of not increasing equipment and workers, and decided to increase production by another 210 sets of complete winches by the end of the year. These winches can equip six mines with an annual output of 900,000 tons of coal. By the end of November, they had increased production by 92 units.
