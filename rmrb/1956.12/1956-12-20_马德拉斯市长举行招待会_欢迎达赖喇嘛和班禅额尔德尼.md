Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 18th. The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni arrived in Madras, the largest industrial and cultural city in southern India with a population of 1.4 million, on the morning of December 17th. They were warmly welcomed at the station by the Governor of Madras State, John, Chief Minister Nadar, the Mayor of Madras, Srinivasan, and other senior officials, prominent public figures, and representatives of the overseas Chinese community.

Srinivasan held a grand reception for the two distinguished guests that evening. When the Dalai Lama spoke at the meeting, he said he was very happy to be able to visit some of the Buddhist holy sites in India. He said that one of the reasons he respected India very much was that India and China were the initiators of Panchsheel (Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence). He also praised the efforts made by Indian Buddhist organizations in promoting Buddhism.

Panchen Erdeni said that he was pleased that India showed infinite respect and love for the Buddha, and that it had made great progress since its independence. He said, "With the friendly relations between India and China as a great foundation, we must do our best to build peace throughout the world."

In his welcoming speech, Srinivasan emphasized the contributions of Chinese pilgrims to the records of certain stages of ancient Indian history. He also presented the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni with famous ivory carvings of Indian gods on behalf of the people of Madras.

The reception was held in a vast park surrounded by densely planted coconut trees, tropical trees, and flowers. The distinguished guests sat under beautiful tents. About five hundred people attended the reception.

    马德拉斯市长举行招待会
    欢迎达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼
    据新华社新德里18日电　达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼在12月17日上午到达印度南部拥有一百四十万人口的最大的工业和文化城市马德拉斯。他们在车站受到马德拉斯邦长约翰、首席部长纳达尔、马德拉斯市长斯里尼瓦桑，以及其他高级官员、著名公众人士和华侨代表的热烈欢迎。
    斯里尼瓦桑在当天晚上为这两位贵宾举行了盛大的招待会。达赖喇嘛在会上讲话的时候，表示他很高兴能够朝拜印度的某些佛教圣地。他说，他非常尊敬印度的一个原因是印度和中国是潘查希拉的倡议者。他还赞扬印度佛教团体在宣传佛法上所作的努力。
    班禅额尔德尼说，印度对佛祖表现出无限的尊敬和爱戴，以及它在独立以来取得了巨大的进步，他为此感到高兴。他说，“有了印度和中国之间的友好关系作为伟大的基础，我们必须尽我们最大的努力来建立全世界的和平。”
    斯里尼瓦桑在他的欢迎词中强调指出了中国的朝圣者对印度古代历史某些阶段的纪录所作的贡献。他还代表马德拉斯人民向达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼献了著名的印度神的象牙雕象。
    招待会在周围密植着椰子树、热带树木和花草的广阔公园中举行。贵宾们坐在美丽的帐篷下面。大约有五百人出席了这次招待会。
