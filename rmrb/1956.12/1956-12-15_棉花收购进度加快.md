Xinhua News Agency, 11th -- According to statistics from cotton purchasing departments, from the time new cotton came on the market until the end of November, the amount of cotton purchased under the unified purchase system nationwide has reached 56% of the annual unified purchase target. Jiangxi Province has already exceeded its unified purchase target, and Anhui, Hunan, Yunnan, and other provinces have completed more than 90% of their unified purchase targets. Hubei, Liaoning, Zhejiang, and other provinces have also completed more than 80%. In the last five days of November, the total amount purchased in the fourteen major cotton-producing provinces, including Hebei and Shandong, increased by 21% compared to the previous five days.

The progress of cotton unified purchase work was relatively slow in the previous period. Currently, various localities are vigorously implementing the spirit of "collect more, collect faster," further improving procurement work, and striving to complete this year's unified purchase tasks. Jiangsu Province recently organized more than 600 cadres to go to grassroots units to inspect cotton procurement work. Some areas have adjusted the internal organization of purchasing stations to provide various conveniences to agricultural cooperatives when they sell cotton. Shanxi Province returned a portion of cottonseed to agricultural cooperatives that sold seed cotton, eliminating their concerns about not having cotton seeds after selling seed cotton.

    棉花收购进度加快
　　新华社11日讯　据棉花采购部门统计，自新棉上市到11月底，各地棉花统购数量已经达到生产年度统购任务的56％。江西省已经超额完成了统购任务，安徽、湖南、云南等省已经完成统购任务的90％以上，湖北、辽宁、浙江等省也已经完成80％以上。11月份最后五天，河北、山东等十四个主要产棉省的收购总量，比前五天增加了21％。
    前一个时期棉花统购工作进度比较缓慢。目前各地正在大力贯彻多收、快收的精神，进一步改进收购工作，争取完成今年的统购任务。江苏省最近组织了六百多个干部到基层单位去检查棉花收购工作。有些地区调整了采购站内部的组织，尽量给农业社出售棉花的时候各种方便。山西省发还一部分棉籽给出售籽棉的农业社，消除了农业社怕卖了籽棉没棉种的顾虑。
