Xinhua News Agency, Wuhu, 7th. The Wuhu Textile Factory in Anhui has saved a significant amount of raw cotton while improving the quality of its cotton yarn. Since September of this year, the factory's first-grade, first-quality cotton yarn has increased from the original 53% to 95% to 99%; cotton yarn's cotton nits and impurities have also been greatly reduced. From January to November, the entire factory saved the country a total of 57,900+ catties of raw cotton.

During the process of improving the quality of cotton yarn, the factory first encountered the contradiction between saving cotton and improving quality. Because raw cotton fibers and impurities are mixed together, removing impurities inevitably leads to the loss of some raw cotton. Therefore, in the past, engineers, technicians, and workers always believed that reducing the amount of raw cotton used would prevent improved quality, and improving quality would prevent reduced raw cotton use. Since the beginning of this year, the factory leadership has deeply criticized the one-sided view of neglecting quality and placing the two in opposition. They have also mobilized the masses of workers to improve many operational techniques, thereby achieving more impurity removal and less cotton loss. For example, in the past, excessively high temperature and humidity in the workshop caused high moisture content and regain in raw cotton, which reduced the impurity removal efficiency of machinery and increased cotton nits. The workers then researched and established a drying room and added four return air windows to improve temperature and humidity management, reducing cotton nits.

### 芜湖纺织厂经验证明　节约原料和提高质量完全不矛盾

    芜湖纺织厂经验证明
　　节约原料和提高质量完全不矛盾
    新华社芜湖7日电　安徽芜湖纺织厂在提高棉纱质量的基础上节约了大量原棉。从今年9月份起，这个厂棉纱的一等一级品已经由原来占53％提高到95％至99％；棉纱的棉结杂质也大大减少。1月到11月份，全厂共为国家节约了原棉五万七千九百多斤。
    在提高棉纱质量的过程中，这个厂首先遇到的是节约用棉和提高质量的矛盾。因为原棉纤维和杂质是混在一起的，要落去杂质就要落掉一部分原棉。所以过去工程技术人员和职工总是存在着要降低原棉用量就不能提高质量，要提高质量就不能降低原棉用量的想法。今年以来，这个厂领导方面深刻地批判了忽视质量和把两者对立起来的片面观点，并且发动职工群众改进了许多操作技术，因而做到了多落杂和少落棉。如过去车间温湿度过高造成原棉含水多和回潮率大，以致降低了机械的除杂效能和增加了棉结。职工们就研究建立了烘房和增开四个回风窗，改善温湿度的管理情况，减少了棉结。
