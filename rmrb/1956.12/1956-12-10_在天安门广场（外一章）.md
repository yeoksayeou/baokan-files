Editor's Note: Albanian poet Aleks Çaçi visited China in September and October 1955 as a member of the Albanian cultural delegation. After his visit, he wrote many poems about China, and here are two of them.

　　The square surges like the Yellow River, Tiananmen Square overflows with youth, today, boundless excitement fills the whole of China, ah! How joyous, it can no longer be contained! This kind of joy can only happen once: when the people have truly achieved victory. Am I on the banks of the Yellow River? Where does this boundless wave come from? Listening to these enthusiastic voices and music, these calls with the same goal: are members of the global choir, members of the peace choir that surrounds the globe. Several centuries have passed, high mountains have become hills, and rivers have changed direction, but the Chinese people are still advancing by leaps and bounds, and will never change for thousands of years: to be the masters of the country, to be their own masters, never willing to hear the name "slave" again. It's over, vanished, the people of the night, the imperialists, the feudal landlords have vanished, like the night driven away by dawn, like the morning dew, they are finished. Good, people, hold your hands tightly, I am your brother, come, let me embrace you. "October 1st," this unforgettable day, the red flag of freedom flies high, the Chinese sky seems to be laughing, casting golden light into space. Asia is no longer like yesterday, the path chosen by itself has already begun…

　　在天安门广场（外一章）
　　阿尔巴尼亚　阿历克斯·恰奇
    编者按　阿尔巴尼亚诗人阿历克斯·恰奇曾在1955年9、10月间作为阿尔巴尼亚文化代表团的团员访问过我国。在访问以后，他写了不少关于我国的诗，这里是其中的两首。广场像黄河般地奔腾，天安门前洋溢着青春，今天，无限的兴奋充满了整个中国，呵！多么愉快，已经容纳不住了呵！这种愉快只可能有一次：当人民真正获得了胜利的时候。难道我是在黄河边上？这无边的浪涛从何而来？耳听着这热情的声音和乐曲，这怀着同一个目标的呼声：是全球合唱团的团员，是环绕全球的和平合唱团的一员。好几个世纪已经过去，高山已经变成小丘，河流也改变了方向，但中国人民依旧大踏步前进，千百年来永远也不会改变：做国家的主人，做自己的主人，“奴隶”这个名字再也不愿听到。完了，消失了，黑夜的人们，帝国主义者，封建地主们消失了，像被黎明赶走的黑夜一样，像早晨的露珠一样，他们完蛋了。好啊，人民，紧握你的手，我是你的兄弟，来吧，让我拥抱你。“十、一”这使我难忘的日子，自由的红旗高高地飘扬，中国的天空好像也在欢笑，把黄金的光芒投向太空。亚细亚再不像昨天，自己选择的道路已经开始……
