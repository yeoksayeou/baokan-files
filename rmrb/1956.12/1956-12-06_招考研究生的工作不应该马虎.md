　　The Work of Recruiting Graduate Students Should Not Be Careless
　　I participated in the entrance examination for graduate students at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shenyang. I think the preparation work for this exam was very poor.
　　First, the examination address was temporarily changed from the Institute of Metal Research of the Academy of Sciences to the Cadre School of the Academy of Sciences, which caused many inconveniences to the candidates.
　　The candidates had already arrived, but the exam papers had not been delivered the day before the exam. So, the exam had to be postponed for a day. Some people who applied to other universities had a conflict in time because of this, and had to give up one side.
　　In the past, the examination order was always stipulated, but this time it was not in order. At the same time, after the list of candidates participating in the sessions was announced, it was suddenly discovered that among the three candidates taking a certain course, two took the exam in the morning and one took the exam in the afternoon. Also, one candidate had no number on the list, but there was an exam paper in the examination room.
　　Secondly, errors were found in the exam papers during the examination. There were many errors in the English test paper, and there were also errors in the Russian test paper. This shows that the work of the exam papers was also very careless.
　　Third, the arrangements for the candidates' lives were not good enough. For example, sometimes they ate cold rice, and the selling price of the dishes was relatively expensive.
　　I think these issues are worth the attention of the Academy of Sciences.　　Shen Sheng

　  招考研究生的工作不应该马虎
    我在沈阳参加了中国科学院招收研究生的考试。我认为这次考试的准备工作作的很差。
    首先，考试地址临时变更，由科学院金属研究所移到科学院干部学校，给考生造成了许多不便。
    考生已经到齐，但考卷在考试前一日还没有运到。于是，只得把考期推迟一天。有些报考其他高等学校的人，由于这么一来，时间上就冲突了，不得不放弃一边。
    过去考试总规定好考试顺序，然而这次却没有按顺序。同时，公布考生参加的场次名单以后，忽然发现考某一课程的三人中，有二人上午考一人下午考。还有，一考生在名单中无号，然而试场上却有考卷。
    其次，在考试进行当中发现考卷有差误。英文试卷错误不少，俄文试卷也有错误。这说明考卷的工作做的也是很马虎的。
    第三，对考生在生活上的安排也不够好。如有时候吃冷饭，菜的卖价也比较贵。
    我认为这些问题是值得引起科学院重视的。　　沈生
