Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 29th - The Sixth Session of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam solemnly opened at the Hanoi Grand Theatre at 8:00 AM today.

The 229 representatives elected by the nationwide general election in Vietnam ten years ago attended the session. During the approximately twenty-day session, they will formulate future struggle guidelines for consolidating the North and achieving national reunification, and consider amending the constitution formulated ten years ago to adapt it to the current situation.

The leaders of the Vietnam Labor Party, the government, the Fatherland Front, various parties, and people's organizations, as well as foreign diplomatic envoys to Vietnam and the representatives of India and Poland from the International Commission in Vietnam, were invited to attend the session. Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam, delivered the opening speech.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh then congratulated the National Assembly and the representatives on behalf of the Vietnam Labor Party and the government.

In his address, he pointed out that this session of the National Assembly was being held under new developments in both the domestic and international situations.

He said: "Internationally, imperialism is conspiring to create aggression and counter-revolutionary activities in an attempt to hinder the development of socialist forces and national liberation movements. However, socialist forces are still growing stronger, national liberation movements are still rising higher, and the peace camp is still expanding."

When talking about the domestic situation, Chairman Ho Chi Minh said: "While we have achieved successes, our work also has some mistakes and shortcomings, and the enemy is using this situation to try to create more difficulties for us. But, on the whole, our victory conditions are fundamental, and the difficulties are temporary."

Chairman Ho Chi Minh emphasized: "Despite the fact that the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem regime are creating many obstacles for us, we will continue to struggle for national reunification and demand the implementation of the Geneva Accords. We believe that the North will definitely become stronger and life will become better. The struggle for national reunification is a long and arduous struggle, but we will surely achieve victory."

Ho Chi Minh also pointed out that this session of the National Assembly is a meeting to develop national democracy, that is, to develop democracy for the people and develop dictatorship over the enemies of the people, and it is also a meeting of unity. He called on all representatives to strengthen unity and struggle for the consolidation of the North and for the realization of national reunification.

When Chairman Ho Chi Minh finished speaking, all the representatives responded with long and enthusiastic cheers.

Afterwards, the assembly listened to the report by Sun Guangfa on "The Work of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly in the Past Year and the Current Situation, and the Tasks to be Solved," and also listened to two additional reports on amending the constitution and improving the organization of the National Assembly.

At the afternoon session, the assembly elected three subcommittees, responsible for studying the above issues and drafting resolutions separately.

The assembly will adjourn for one day tomorrow and begin group discussions on the 31st.

(Editor's note) According to Xinhua News Agency data: The National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was elected on January 6, 1946. In order to consolidate the democratic republic system, the government promulgated the election law shortly after the victory of the "August Revolution" in 1945. On January 6, 1946, Vietnam held a nationwide general election under the extremely difficult circumstances of facing a French war of aggression. The Vietnamese people actively and bravely participated in the general election. The number of voters in the country reached more than 85% of the total number of voters in the country. The election resulted in the establishment of the National Assembly. At its first meeting in March 1946, the National Assembly authorized Chairman Ho Chi Minh to form a government. The second meeting in November 1946 passed the constitution.
