Xinhua News Agency, 29th: China has engaged in academic exchanges with twenty-seven countries this year. Chinese scientists are becoming more active in international scientific affairs.

This year, seventy-six Chinese scientists attended sixteen international scientific conferences held in thirteen countries, including the Netherlands, Brazil, Spain, Belgium, and France. With the exception of the Conference of Young Sinologists in Paris, China participated in the other fifteen international academic conferences for the first time. In addition, Chinese scientists also attended more than thirty scientific conferences held in one country. Last year, Chinese scientists only participated in four international academic conferences and twenty-one scientific conferences held in one country.

When the famous Chinese philosopher Feng Youlan went to Geneva to participate in the eleventh "International Meeting" centered on the discussion of "Tradition" and "Innovation," newspapers there frequently published news and photos about him. He was also invited to participate in television and radio broadcasts. A dispatch in the London Times evaluating this international meeting wrote: "The individual who achieved the greatest success in upholding tradition at this conference was the young Bamette; the main proponent of innovation was the Chinese Marxist historian Mr. Feng."

Professor Zhu Ziqing, an organic chemist, reported on his research on fritillary alkaloids at the Plant Alkaloid Conference in the German Democratic Republic. His report was welcomed by the entire audience. When he finished his report, Soviet biochemist Professor Ilyin held his hand tightly and said, "You gave a wonderful report." Many other Chinese scientists were also very popular abroad.

At scientific conferences held abroad, Chinese scientists learned about the progress of scientific research in various countries and the advanced level of world science, and obtained a lot of new knowledge and information. They established friendships with scientists from many countries, enabling these foreign scientists to have a further understanding of New China. Those who returned from attending scientific conferences held abroad always brought back a large number of names of foreign scientists who sincerely hoped to visit China.

This year, nearly two hundred scientists from nineteen countries have visited China to give lectures or participate in scientific conferences. Many foreign scholars have given a large number of academic lectures in China; they have put forward many constructive suggestions when visiting research institutions and production units.

Last year, only nearly one hundred scientists from fourteen countries visited China. Austria, Portugal, Spain and other countries have only begun to have scientific exchanges with New China this year.

    中外科学家接触频繁
    今年有二十七国同我国进行学术性往来
    新华社29日讯　今年有二十七个国家同中国进行了学术性的往来。中国科学家在国际科学事务中更加活跃了。
    在这一年中，中国有七十六个科学家分别出席了在荷兰、巴西、西班牙、比利时、法国等十三个国家举行的十六个国际科学会议。除了在巴黎举行的青年汉学家会议以外，其他十五个国际学术会议中国都是第一次参加。此外，中国科学家还出席了一国举行的三十多个科学会议。去年，中国科学家只参加了四个国际性学术会议和一国举行的二十一个科学会议。
    中国著名哲学家冯友兰到日内瓦去参加以“传统”和“革新”为讨论中心的“国际会晤”第十一次大会的时候，那里的报纸经常刊载有关他的消息和他的照片，他并且被邀请参加电视广播节目和录音广播演说，伦敦时报刊载的一篇评介这次国际会晤的通讯中写道：“这次大会在拥护传统方面得到最大成功的个人是年青的巴梅特；革新的主要宣传者是中国的马克思主义历史学家冯先生。”
    有机化学家朱子清教授在德意志民主共和国植物碱会议上报告了他对贝母植物碱的研究工作。他的报告受到全场欢迎，在他报告完毕的时候，苏联生物化学家依利金教授紧握着他的手说：“你做了很精彩的报告”。其他不少中国科学家在国外也很受欢迎。
    在外国举行的科学会议上，中国科学家了解了各国科学研究的进展和世界科学的先进水平，得到了许多新的知识和资料。他们同许多国家的科学家建立了友谊，使这些外国科学家对新中国有了进一步的认识。出席在国外举行的科学会议归来的人总是带回来大批热诚希望来中国访问的外国科学家的名字。
    今年来中国访问、讲学或参加科学会议的有十九个国家的近二百个科学家。许多外国学者在中国作了大量的学术讲演；在参观研究机构和生产单位时，提出了许多建设性的意见。
    去年到中国访问的只有十四个国家的近一百个科学家。奥地利、葡萄牙、西班牙等国家都是从今年开始同新中国科学界交往的。
