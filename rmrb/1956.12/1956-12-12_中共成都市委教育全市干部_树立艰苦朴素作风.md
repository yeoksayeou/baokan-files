Xinhua News Agency News: The Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is conducting ideological education work centered on establishing a style of hard work and plain living among cadres in Chengdu's government offices, enterprises, and schools.

Since November, the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has conducted in-depth investigations in some government offices and discovered that some cadres are developing tendencies such as pursuing enjoyment, being unwilling to live a hard life, being extravagant and wasteful, and having lax labor discipline. The Municipal Committee decided to conduct an ideological education campaign centered on hard work and plain living among cadres in city government offices starting in November. Mi Jianshu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Municipal Committee, gave a report to党员 cadres above the section chief level in the city, criticized various unhealthy tendencies, and called for the establishment of a style of hard work and plain living. From November 23rd, the municipal-level directly affiliated organs and the districts under their jurisdiction had members of the district committees of the Chinese Communist Party or heads of party organizations at all levels give reports or convey messages to cadres and party members in government offices, factories, enterprises, schools, hospitals, and handicraft production cooperatives. After the messages were conveyed, they combined them with in-depth study of the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, organized discussion meetings, and launched criticism and self-criticism. Some government offices invited staff who had participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan to talk about the Party's fine tradition of hard work and plain living.

Currently, the Municipal Committee is preparing to conduct further in-depth investigation and research based on the preliminary findings, and continue to strengthen the political and ideological education of cadres, students, and workers.

    树立艰苦朴素作风
    新华社讯　中共成都市委员会正在成都市机关、企业和学校的干部中进行一次以树立艰苦朴素作风为中心内容的思想教育工作。
    从11月份以来，中共成都市委员会曾经深入调查了部分机关，发现有些干部正滋长着追求享受，不愿过艰苦生活，奢侈浪费，劳动纪律松弛等现象。市委决定从11月起在全市机关干部中进行一次以艰苦朴素为中心内容的思想教育工作。市委书记处书记米建书向全市科长以上党员干部作了报告，批判了各种不良倾向，要求树立艰苦朴素作风。市级直属机关和所属各区，从11月23日起由中共区委委员或各级党组织负责人分别向机关、工厂、企业、学校、医院和手工业生产合作社中的干部、党员作了报告或传达，传达后并结合深入学习中共第八次代表大会文件，组织座谈讨论，展开批评和自我批评。有的机关邀请一些参加过抗日战争的工作人员，讲述党的艰苦朴素的优良传统。
    目前，市委正在根据初步检查出的情况，准备再深入调查研究，继续加强对干部、学生、工人的政治思想教育工作。
