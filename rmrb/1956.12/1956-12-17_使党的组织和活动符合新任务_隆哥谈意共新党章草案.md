Xinhua News Agency, Rome, December 15th: According to TASS, Italian Communist Party Deputy General Secretary Longo gave a report on the draft of the new statute of the Italian Communist Party at the meeting of the Party's Eighth National Congress on the 14th. He said that the starting point for drafting the party constitution was: The party's organization and activities must meet the new tasks brought about by the current situation.

Longo said that the new draft party constitution, compared with the original party constitution, does not have any innovations in principle. This revision is only to eliminate the shortcomings that have accumulated over a long period of time in the relationship between the party's leading organs and lower-level organizations, as well as the shortcomings within the lower-level organizations themselves.

Longo said that the Party must be able to effectively play its leading role for the working class and the majority of the people on Italy's path to socialism, which requires more active life in party organizations at all levels, greater responsibility for ordinary party members, allowing them to play more initiative, more effective exchange of views and experiences, and carry out criticism from top to bottom and from bottom to top within the party.

Longo pointed out that the new draft party constitution must maintain democratic centralism, which is the basic principle for regulating party life. At the same time, he pointed out that the most important modification in the draft party constitution is the provision for the establishment of supervisory bodies in organizations at all levels to supervise compliance with democracy and the party constitution.

The party constitution also reflects the instructions contained in the outline published before the National Congress, the purpose of these instructions being to eliminate serious shortcomings such as replacing collective work with individual arbitrariness.

A large part of Longo's report talked about the issue of party democracy and contact with the masses. He said, the more powerful our party becomes and the higher the prestige it enjoys, the more it needs to maintain close contact with the masses and let the masses supervise our policies and our work.

Longo finally talked about the issue of unity within the party. He pointed out: The unity that the party demands is ideological unity on all major principles and unity in action on all practical issues. Without discipline, the party cannot most effectively carry out the struggle to defend the working people and strive for freedom, peace and socialism; and discipline is based on consciously agreeing with the party program and the party's tasks.

    使党的组织和活动符合新任务
    隆哥谈意共新党章草案
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社罗马15日讯：意大利共产党副总书记隆哥在党第八次全国代表大会14日会议上就意大利共产党的新党章草案作了报告。他说，拟订党章草案的出发点是：必须使党的组织和活动符合当前局势所带来的新任务。
    隆哥说，新党章草案同原来的党章相比，并没有什么原则上的革新。这次修改只是为了清除党的领导机构和下级组织的关系中长期积累下来的缺点以及下级组织本身内部的缺点。
    隆哥说，党必须能够在意大利走向社会主义的道路上对工人阶级和大多数人民有效地起自己的领导作用，这就要求党内各级组织的生活更加活跃，要求普通党员有更大的责任感，让他们发挥更多的主动性，更有效地交换意见和交流经验，在党内展开自上而下和自下而上的批评。
    隆哥指出，新党章草案必须保持民主集中制，这是调节党内生活的基本原则。同时，他指出，党章草案中最重要的修改是规定在各级组织中成立监察机构，来监督对民主和党章的遵守。
    党章还反映了在代表大会前发表的提纲中所包含的指示，这些指示的目的是消除以个人专断代替集体工作等严重缺点。
    隆哥的报告中很大一部分谈到党的民主和同群众联系的问题。他说，我们的党越加强大，它所享有的威信越高，就越需要同群众保持密切的联系，让群众监督我们的方针和我们的工作。
    隆哥最后谈到了关于党内团结的问题。他指出：党所要求的一致，是对所有主要的原则问题的思想上的一致，是对所有实际问题的行动上的一致。没有纪律，党就不能最有效地进行保卫劳动人民以及争取自由、和平和社会主义的斗争；而纪律是以自觉地赞同党纲和党的任务为基础的。
