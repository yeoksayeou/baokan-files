    Have you been to East Lake? The East Lake in Wuchang is a beautiful place.

    East Lake doesn't have the towering cliffs on the shores of Dianchi Lake, nor the colorful cloud reflections on the water, nor are its waves as large as Dianchi Lake's. But East Lake has its own beautiful and natural posture. Here are soft, inviting grasslands; willow trees like fifteen or sixteen-year-old girls, their gentle branches softly touching the ground, as if no one but the birds have ever been close to them. Close to the lake, in the thick shade of the willow leaves, one or two clean and light fishing boats reveal half their bows, their sides sheltered by round lotus leaves, truly a scene from the Mustard Seed Garden Painting Manual.

    But what is most beautiful and evocative about East Lake is the lake full of lush green aquatic plants.

    Three or two feet from the surface, under the emerald green lake water, emerald green aquatic plants grow luxuriantly, intertwined and knotted, spread out like a continuous velvet carpet; the bottom of the boat glides lightly over this carpet. When the oars stir the water, the upward-growing grass gently sways. It is said that in the seabed of the South China Sea, there are many underwater forests, growing precious tall trees of several dozen feet. Looking at these green branches and leaves, you can't help but wonder, in this deep and secluded lake water, how tall are the treetops of this "forest"? I heard that there are Yangtze River finless porpoises, a special product of the Yangtze River, and large fish weighing hundreds of pounds in East Lake. Aren't they all hidden in the green "forest" below you?! Lower your head and look carefully into the aquatic plants, how many free and carefree fish are playing hide-and-seek inside. This is another world, but unfortunately you are another species, unable to be with them.

    The "forest" at the bottom of the lake is beautiful, but it is also dangerous to people. Some people have lost their lives in the aquatic plants. I casually picked up a section of aquatic plant as big as a child's arm. This is the same kind of aquatic plant that I keep in a glass tank with small goldfish! They are actually of the same species! But in this huge container of East Lake, how strong this aquatic plant grows! The thick, hard, dark green stems and leaves prove its strong vitality. Who knows how tall its body really is? Who knows how big its interconnected body is? But the aquatic plant in my glass tank, due to lack of nutrients and sunlight, in that little bit of water, has become as thin as cotton fiber, yellow all over, and has become as small as a finger.

    On the edge of East Lake, there is a pond of water lilies, blooming with white and red flowers, as big as clasped hands. The large, round leaves shine green in the sunlight. How good this is! I have also seen their captive sisters, small and pitiful in delicate stone-carved flower pots in Beijing, their leaves no bigger than the mouth of a teacup. They live only as a decoration in people's lives.

    Why are petrels so agile? Because they grow up in the storms at sea. Why are the wings of wild geese so strong? Because under their wings, they glide over thousands of miles every year. Brothers, come to the strong sunshine, the raging wind and rain, and bravely accept the tempering of combat life!

　　湖底森林
　　闻山
    你到过东湖吗？武昌的东湖，是个美丽的地方。
    东湖，它四周没有滇池边上巍然耸立的悬崖峭壁，没有映漾在水波上的彩色的云影，风波也没有滇池那么大。但东湖有它自己秀丽自然的姿态。这儿有软绵绵的留人脚步的浅草地；像十五、六岁的女孩子的小柳树，轻柔的枝叶婆娑着地，好像除了鸟儿，就没人和它们亲过。靠着湖边，柳叶的浓荫下，一两只洁净轻巧的小渔船，露出半个船头，船边遮掩着圆圆的荷叶，真像芥子园画谱里的景色呢。
    但东湖最美丽、最引人遐想的是那满湖绿幽幽的水草。
    离水面三尺两尺，在碧琉璃似的湖水底下，翡翠绿的水草茂盛地生长，缠绕交结，平铺着像一块连绵不断的绒毡；船底就从这毡上轻轻滑过。当木棹拨动水波，那向上生长的草便轻轻摇摆。据说在我国南海海底，有许多海底森林，长着数丈高的名贵的大树。看着这绿色的枝叶，你就不能不想一下，在这深幽幽的湖水里，这究竟是长了多高的“森林”的树梢？听说，东湖里有长江特产的江猪，有上百斤的大鱼。它们，可不都藏在你下面的绿色的“森林”里？！你低下头细心地往水草里看吧，有多少自由自在的鱼儿，正在里面玩着捉迷藏的游戏。这是另外一个世界，可惜你是另外一个种族，不能和它们在一起。
    湖底的“森林”，是美丽的，但对人也是危险的。有人在水草里丧失了生命。我随手捞起一截像孩子手臂那么大的水草，这就是和我放在玻璃缸里跟小金鱼在一起的那种水草呵，它们居然是属于同一种族的呵！可在东湖这个庞大的容器里，这株水草长的多么健壮！粗硬的深绿色的茎叶，证明它有强盛的生活力。谁知道它的身子究竟有多高呢？谁知道它的牵连不断的躯体，又有多大呢？而在我的玻璃缸里的水草，因为缺乏养料和阳光，在那一点儿水里，已经瘦弱得像棉花的纤维，通体透黄，而且变得像手指那么小了。
    在东湖边，有一池睡莲，盛开着白色的红色的花，像合捧的手掌那么大。那大而圆的叶子，在阳光下，绿油油地发光。这多好呵！我也看见过它们的被囚禁的姐妹，在北京精致的石雕的花盆里，娇小而可怜，叶子比茶杯口大不了多少。它们生活着，只是人们生活里的一种装饰。
    为什么海燕那么矫捷？因为它们在海上的风暴中成长。为什么大雁的翅膀那么强健？因为在它们翼下，年年滑过千里万里的路程。兄弟们呵，到强烈的阳光、狂暴的风雨中来，勇敢地接受战斗生活的磨练！
