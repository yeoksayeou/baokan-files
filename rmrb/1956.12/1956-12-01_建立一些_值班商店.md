    Establish Some "On-Duty Stores"
    Currently, in some large and medium-sized cities, department stores, pharmacies, restaurants, vegetable stalls, and even pedicabs stop operating as soon as it's off-work hours. The stores close, the restaurants extinguish their fires, and the pedicabs return home. This operating system is not very convenient for the vast urban residents and travelers. I suggest that in major and medium-sized cities, some on-duty shops be established on holidays and at night, just like in the Soviet Union, with on-duty stores, on-duty hospitals, on-duty pharmacies, and on-duty restaurants. This can bring a lot of convenience to urban residents and travelers.

### 建立一些“值班商店”

    建立一些“值班商店”
    现在有些大、中城市的百货商店、药铺、饭馆、菜摊，甚至三轮车，一到下班时间就停止了营业。商店关了门，饭馆熄了火，三轮车回了家。这种营业制度，对广大城市居民和旅客是不太方便的。我建议在各大、中城市里，在假日和夜晚设立一些值班店铺，像苏联一样。有值班商店、值班医院、值班药房、值班饭馆。这样可以给城市居民和旅客带来很多的方便。
