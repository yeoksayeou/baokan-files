Xinhua News Agency News: More than 99% of the demobilized soldiers who returned to Sichuan Province this year have been properly resettled. The vast majority of them have participated in agricultural production.

In resettling demobilized soldiers, all localities have generally achieved "receiving them at any time, resettling them at any time" and "resettling one, consolidating one." Appropriate adjustments have also been made to those who were not properly resettled in the past, based on needs and possibilities, basically achieving making the best use of everyone's talents.

Demobilized soldiers who have been properly resettled have played a good role in various production and work posts. More than half of the demobilized soldiers resettled in agricultural production in Baoxing County this year have been elected as township heads, agricultural cooperative directors, or committee members. Zhang Guocheng, a demobilized soldier from Dalin Township, Jiang'an County, has made outstanding achievements in drought resistance and other movements, and has also been selected as a provincial-level agricultural production model.

    四川复员军人绝大部分得到妥善安置
    新华社讯　今年回到四川省的复员军人，已经有99％以上得到了妥善安置。其中绝大多数参加了农业生产。
    各地在安置复员军人时，一般都做到了“随时接收，随时安置”和“安置一个，巩固一个”。对于过去安置不妥当的人员，也都根据需要与可能作了适当的调整，基本上做到了人尽其才，才尽其用。
    经过妥善安置的复员军人，在各个生产和工作岗位上都起到了良好的作用。宝兴县今年安置从事农业生产的复员军人中，有一半以上被选为乡长、农业社长或社务委员。江安县大林乡复员军人张国成，在抗旱等运动中做出了突出的成绩，还被选为省级农业生产模范。
