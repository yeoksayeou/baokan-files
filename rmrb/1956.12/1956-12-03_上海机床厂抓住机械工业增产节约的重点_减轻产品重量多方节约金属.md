Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 1st. The design personnel of Shanghai Machine Tool Plant summarized their experience in reducing the weight of machine tools a few days ago.

An improved machine tool design by engineer Yang Daling thinned the bed frame, which accounts for more than half of the total weight, and some steel plate and cast iron shields, thus reducing the weight of each machine tool by 356 kilograms. Calculated according to the planned output of this type of machine tool next year, 114 tons of steel can be saved. The oil pump of another machine tool designed with the help of Soviet experts has its weight reduced by a quarter. According to next year's planned output, more than 8 tons of metal can also be saved. The designers believe that these improvements have no impact on the quality of the machine tool, and they have now begun to apply these experiences to the design of eight other machine tools.

Other departments of the factory are also trying to find ways to further save metal. In the past, when preparing materials, workers in the preparation workshop generally lengthened the specified length by three or four millimeters, sometimes up to ten millimeters, for fear of cutting the steel short. Calculated based on the more than 400 sections of steel used in each machine tool and this year's machine tool output, at least more than ten kilometers of steel was wasted. Now the factory's standardization office has formulated cutting tolerances to prevent this waste. The casting workshop and forging workshop are also working hard to reduce the surplus of metallized castings and processing.

Since the beginning of this year, the factory's material distribution department has utilized 22 tons of scrap steel. The result of utilizing these cut-off ends has supplied the steel needed for more than 60 grinders.

The factory has recycled a total of 1,542 tons of scrap steel this year. In order to overcome the current difficulty in the supply of pig iron, the factory is building a regenerative iron smelting furnace; after it is completed, it will be able to produce more than 3,000 kilograms of regenerative iron per day.

### 上海机床厂抓住机械工业增产节约的重点　减轻产品重量多方节约金属

    上海机床厂抓住机械工业增产节约的重点
　　减轻产品重量多方节约金属
    新华社上海1日电　上海机床厂设计人员在几天以前总结了减轻机床体重的经验。
    由工程师杨大龄改进的一种机床设计，把占总重量一半以上的床身和其他一些钢板、铸铁的护罩都改薄了，因此每台机床减轻了三百五十六公斤。按明年这种机床的计划产量计算，可以节约一百一十四吨钢铁。另一种由苏联专家帮助设计的机床油泵、重量减轻了四分之一，按明年的计划产量计算，也可以节约金属八吨多。设计人员们认为这些改进对机床的质量没有影响，现在他们已经开始在其他八种机床的设计中运用这些经验。
    这个厂的其他各个部门都在想办法进一步节约金属。过去，准备车间工人在割料的时候，为了怕把钢材割短，一般都按规定的长度放长三、四公厘，有时放长到十公厘。以每台机床要用四百多段钢材和今年的机床产量计算，至少浪费了长达十多公里的钢材。现在厂的标准化室已经制定了割料的公差，防止这种浪费。铸工车间、锻造车间也都在努力压缩金属化铸和加工的余量。
    今年以来，这个厂的发料部门已经利用了二十二吨断头钢材。这些割剩下来的断头加以利用的结果，供应了六十多台磨床需要的钢材。
    这个厂今年已经回收的废钢铁共达一千五百四十二吨。为了克服当前生铁供应的困难，厂里正在建造一座再生铁熔炼炉；建成以后，每天能出再生铁三千多公斤。
