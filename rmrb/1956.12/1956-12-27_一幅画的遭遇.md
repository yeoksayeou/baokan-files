    The art of mounting paintings in our country has, since ancient times, produced masters and innovations in every generation. This art has long been famous both at home and abroad. Roughly speaking, the art of mounting new paintings (modern works that have not been mounted) is a basic skill; the ability to restore old paintings (ancient, already mounted works) to their original condition is considered mastery. However, there are technical differences between restoring old paper paintings and restoring old silk paintings. A master of mounting paintings approaches each "mounting job" with great care and prudence, especially when dealing with ancient paintings. A moment of carelessness can either darken the painting further or rob it of its original spirit. The most revealing aspect of a mounter's skill when mounting new paintings is the color coordination of the silk brocade and the "life paper" – the paper that shares the life of the original painting – pasted on the back of the painting. The color coordination of the silk brocade plays an extremely important role in accentuating the painting. For both ink wash paintings and colored paintings, the colors of the silk brocade must be appropriately matched according to the density of the ink and the lightness of the colors. As for the "life paper" pasted on the back of the painting, it is relatively easy if it is a painting of shrimp or crabs by Qi Baishi, but it requires particularly skilled mounting techniques if it is a heavy color painting on silk.
    I painted a "Peony and Dove" picture, with a total of eight peony flowers, including buds, and two doves. It was painted on specially woven raw silk that was colored on both sides and had the "life paper" already pasted on the back. If this painting were to be mounted as a hanging scroll or a framed panel, it would not be necessary to remove the "life paper." Of course, a skilled mounter could still remove the "life paper" and remount it. However, after this painting was acquired by a certain organization, the "life paper" was removed and replaced with another layer. What was the result? One of the dove's eyes was blinded, and the top of the other dove's head was bald. The colors of almost every petal and every leaf were peeled off, resembling a mottled melon! Perhaps there were some flaws in the original "life paper," but how could I not be heartbroken to see it turned into this state!
    Recently, I have seen more than a dozen of my own works that have been poorly mounted, with problems such as color bleeding, unevenness, and blistering. Most strangely, they even use bleaching powder when mounting new paintings, turning green leaves into blue leaves and red flowers into white flowers. And yet, some people actually praised me, thinking it was the versatile and varied nature of Chinese painting colors, which truly made me both cry and laugh!

    一幅画的遭遇
    于非闇
    裱画，在我国是自古以来代出名手、代有发明的。这种艺术，久已中外驰名。关于裱画的艺术，约略谈起来，大概裱新画
  （现代未裱过的作品）是初步的手艺；揭裱旧画（古代已裱过的旧作品）要它整旧如新，这才算是到了家的手艺。但其中还分揭裱旧纸画与揭裱旧绢画技术上的不同。在裱画的高手，对于一件
  “裱活”，都是非常仔细而审慎地加以研究的，特别是古代绘画，稍一粗心大意，裱出来的不是更晦暗，就是失掉原画的精神。在裱新画时，最见裱画手艺的地方是：绫绢颜色的配合和托裱画面背后的“命纸”——与原画共生命的纸。绫绢颜色的配合，对画面是起着极其重要的烘托作用的。在水墨画或彩色画，绫绢的颜色，完全需要依据水墨的浓淡和彩色的轻重而适当地配合的。至于托裱画面背后的“命纸”，如果是齐白石画的大虾、螃蟹，还比较容易，如果是绢本重彩的画，就更需要特别熟练的托裱技巧。
    我画了一幅“牡丹鸽子”，共画了连“骨朵”在内的八朵牡丹花、两只鸽子，是用特织的生丝绢两面涂抹颜色画成的，并且已托裱了背后的“命纸”。如果这幅画要裱成挂轴或镜屏，可以不必再将“命纸”揭去。当然，高明的裱手，还是可以揭下“命纸”另裱的。可是这幅画被某机关收购以后，就被揭去“命纸”，另裱了一层，结果怎样呢？一只鸽子的眼睛瞎了，另一只鸽子的头顶秃了。每个花瓣、每个叶片的颜色，几乎全被揭成了花皮瓜的样子！也许原来托裱的“命纸”，有些缺点，但弄成这个样子，怎能不使我痛心！
    近来看到我自己的作品，已有十几幅被裱坏，有颜色渗出、不匀、起泡等等的毛病。最奇怪的是，裱新画还使用漂白粉，使得绿叶子变成蓝叶子，红花变成白花，还居然有人对我称赏，认为是国画色彩的变幻多端，这真使得我啼笑皆非！
