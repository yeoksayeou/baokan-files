Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 28th: The Asian Writers Conference held a plenary session on the afternoon of the 27th and unanimously adopted the reports on cultural exchange, Asian traditions, writers and the writing profession, and writers and freedom, submitted by the four committees established by the conference.

    **Suggestions to Encourage Cultural Exchange: Exchange Books and Mutual Visits**

    The report of the Cultural Exchange Committee suggests freely organizing and encouraging the exchange of literary and artistic works, books, and films, mutual visits by cultural delegations, and the exchange of translations and research materials. "Countries can take turns offering special literary prizes to reward Asian writers."

    The report states: "In Asia, a wide variety of cultures are interestingly interwoven." "We must learn to appreciate each other's languages and literature, not only understanding two languages but also many, thereby continuously improving our cultural cultivation."

    **Asian Traditions Have Commonalities: Writers Are Asked to Carry Them Forward**

    The report of the Asian Traditions Committee states that the traditions of Asian countries "differ in many aspects, but they have many common factors, and Asian literature often expresses these common factors." The report points out that these common factors are: recognition of the highest value of human beings, recognition of humanitarianism; love of freedom, love of the motherland, love of the people, love of justice, love of life, and emphasis on the spiritual value of life; love of peace, and the feeling of brotherhood within the four seas. The report calls on writers to respect these traditions, draw from them what is beneficial to readers, and further develop them for the benefit of the people.

    The report also says that Asian traditions have interacted with Western civilization, and this relationship has also made great contributions to the progress of mankind. "It is not impossible to harmonize Western civilization with these traditions, and it is the task of writers to try to harmonize them for the benefit of Asia and the whole world."

    **Writers' Remuneration Must Be Guaranteed: Strive for the Popularization of Literary Works**

    The report of the Writers and the Writing Profession Committee proposes that writers must be guaranteed fair and just remuneration for their writing work; libraries and other facilities should be established as much as possible to strive for the popularization of literary works to the widest possible readership; writers must enjoy the freedom to engage in social activities, and effective forms of writers' associations in various countries should be found to protect the writers' indisputable common professional interests.

    **Only by Taking Root in Society Can Writers Write Good Works**

    The report of the Writers and Freedom Committee states: In the discussion, "no one raised any controversy regarding the writer's responsibility to the society in which he lives; moreover, there was no dispute that great works are only possible when the writer is rooted in the society in which he lives." The report points out that at the committee meeting, some people expressed the opinion that writers have a responsibility to society, and therefore, they should write for the benefit, development, and improvement of society. Another opinion was that there should be no interference with writers, and the writer's social obligations and all constraints should be self-generated from within, and writers should not be controlled by the state, politicians, and transient governments. A third opinion was that artistic work is essentially an aesthetic activity, and therefore, artists should not be unnecessarily burdened with external obligations. The report also says that some speakers emphasized that writers who disapprove of the order of the society in which they live particularly need freedom. The report also says: "The discussions were conducted in an extremely friendly and informal atmosphere, and some speakers said that these discussions were useful and called for more meetings of this nature to be held."

    **Indian Representative Proposes the Establishment of a Cultural Exchange Agency**

    All reports were adopted amidst the enthusiastic cheers of the delegates. Indian representative Dr. Abdul Aleem suggested that, in order to implement the various recommendations, especially those put forward in the report on cultural exchange, the conference must establish a cultural exchange agency.

    After holding the last plenary session on the morning of the 28th, the conference will also hold a round table of writers from around the world.

    Prior to the adoption of the various reports, at the plenary session on the morning of the 27th, Italian writer Carlo Levi and another observer, Argentine writer Victor Fodan, spoke. The plenary session also heard reports on the literary situation in several languages, namely Egyptian, Kashmiri, Ceylonese Tamil, Malayalam, Dogri (a local language of Kashmir), and Gujarati.

    亚洲作家会议通过文化交流等问题的报告
    全世界作家圆桌会议将在会议结束后举行
    新华社新德里28日电　亚洲作家会议27日下午举行全体会议，一致通过了由会议成立的四个委员会提出的关于文化交流、亚洲传统、作家和作家职业、作家和自由问题的报告。
    建议鼓励文化交流  交换书籍相互访问
    文化交流问题委员会的报告建议自由举办并且鼓励文艺作品、书籍和影片的交换，文化代表团的相互访问，作品的翻译和研究材料的交换。“各国可以轮流拿出特别文学奖金，奖励亚洲作家们。”
    这项报告说：“在亚洲，各种各样的文化非常有趣地交织了起来”。“我们必须学会欣赏彼此的语文和文学，不仅了解两种语文，而且了解多种语文，从而不断提高文化修养”。
    亚洲传统有共同点  要求作家加以发扬
    亚洲传统问题委员会的报告说，亚洲各国的传统“在许多方面各不相同，但是它们有着许多共同的因素，亚洲的文学经常表现这种共同的因素”。报告指出，这种共同的因素是：承认人有最高的价值，承认人道主义；爱好自由、爱祖国、爱人民、爱正义、爱生活，重视生活的精神价值；爱好和平，四海之内皆兄弟的感情。这项报告要求作家们尊重这种传统，从其中吸取对于读者有利的东西，并且为了人民的利益进一步发展它们。
    这项报告又说，亚洲的传统同西方文明发生了关系，这种关系对于人类的进步也有很大的贡献。“使西方文明同这种传统互相调和起来，并不是不可能的，为了亚洲和全世界的好处而设法调和它们是作家的任务。”
    必须保证作家报酬  力求文学作品普及
    作家和作家职业问题委员会的报告提出建议说，必须保证作家从事写作可以获得正当公平的报酬；应该尽量设立图书馆和其他设施，力求文学作品普及于最广大的读者；必须使作家享受进行社会活动的自由，为了保障作家的不容争论的共同专业利益，应该找出各个国家的作家协会的有效形式。
    只有在社会里扎根  作家才能写好作品
    作家和自由问题委员会的报告说：在讨论中间，“关于作家对于他所在的社会的责任，没有人提出任何争论；而且，只有作家在他所处的社会中扎下根的时候，才有可能有伟大的作品，关于这一点也是没有争论的”。报告指出，在委员会会议上，有一些人表示意见说，作家对于社会负有责任，因此，他就应该为了社会的利益、发展和改进而进行写作。另外一种意见说，不应当对作家进行干涉，作家的社会义务和一切约束都应该是自内产生的，作家不应该受国家、政客和兴废交替的政府的控制。第三种意见说，艺术工作实质上是一种美学的活动，因此，不应该使艺术家不必要地背上外来的义务。报告又说，有些发言的人着重地说，不赞成自己所处的社会的秩序的作家，特别需要自由。报告还说：“讨论是在极其友好和不拘形式的气氛下进行的，有一些发言的人说，这种讨论是有用的，并且要求更多地举行这种性质的会议。”
    印度代表提出建议  成立文化交流机构
    所有报告都在代表们的热烈的欢呼声中获得通过。印度代表阿卜杜勒·阿利姆博士提出建议说，为了执行各种建议特别是关于文化交流的报告中所提出的建议，会议必须成立文化交流机构。
    会议在28日上午举行最后一次全体会议后，还要举行全世界作家的圆桌会议。
    在通过各项报告以前，在27日上午的全体会议上，意大利作家卡洛·勒维和另一位观察员阿根廷作家维克特·福丹讲了话。这次全体会议还听取了关于若干种语文的文学情况的报告，这些语文是埃及文、克什米尔文、锡兰的泰米尔文、马拉雅兰文、多格里文（克什米尔邦的一种地方语文）和古吉拉特文。
