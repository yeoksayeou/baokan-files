    四百多种橡胶新产品
    新华社天津26日电　天津市橡胶工业公司所属橡胶厂，今年试制成功四百六十五种新品种和新花样产品，其中的三百七十五种已经投入生产。
    许多橡胶新产品适合各种不同职业的人们的需要。矿工需要的矿灯帽和作业鞋，高空作业工人必备的轻便绝缘鞋，化学工作者穿用的耐酸工作服，以及乒乓球运动员欢迎的海绵球拍等，都已经大量生产。各种美观大方的女式胶底凉鞋，防雪、防寒的全胶鞋和民族形式的女鞋，也都已经出现在百货商店的橱窗里。许多橡胶厂还为农村劳动妇女设计制造了各种式样的轻便胶鞋。一种出口的高级府绸胶布也出厂了。
    还有不少新产品是过去国内没有生产过的。如供鞍钢用的三种耐油、耐热、耐高压的特殊性能的胶管，治黄、治淮用的大虹吸管和大排泥管，水力发电用的水封闸垫和医疗用具胃镜套管等。
