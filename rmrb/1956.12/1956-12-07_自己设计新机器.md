    Design New Machines Ourselves
    The main requirement of our country's socialist industrialization is to basically build a complete industrial system in about three five-year plan periods. The machinery industry is one of the main links in building this complete industrial system. It must provide a sufficient number of new products and new equipment for the development of all sectors of the national economy.
    In the past few years, China's machinery industry has manufactured thousands of new products to meet the needs of various sectors of the national economy. Due to the weakness of our own design capabilities, most of these products were produced by imitating product drawings supplied by the Soviet Union and fraternal countries, and by self-surveying product drawings. In 1957, of the more than 400 new products we plan to develop, more than 300 new products still need to be completed by imitation. This shows that, both in the past and now, imitation is an important method to solve the weakness of our country's design capabilities. In the future, for a certain period of time, it will still be an important method to solve the shortage of design capabilities in our country.
    However, with the development of the national economy, simply relying on imitation can no longer meet the needs. Some products can be imitated or surveyed according to existing drawings; there are also many products that must be designed by ourselves according to the resources, natural characteristics, and specific conditions and requirements of our own country. For example, our country has little wasteland, and in addition to dry land, there are also paddy fields. Therefore, when designing agricultural machinery, we must consider the characteristics of our country's terrain, soil, climate, and farming methods, and cannot simply imitate. Various power equipment and special-purpose equipment must also be designed according to specific usage conditions and the characteristics of power resources.
    As far as the machinery industry itself is concerned, if we do not consider the production characteristics of our own factories and mechanically copy foreign designs, it will also cause unreasonable phenomena in production, thereby affecting the发挥 of production capacity. For example, the Soviet-style universal machine tools produced by our machine tool factory are excellent in themselves. However, since we produce products in the same factory that are produced in several factories in the Soviet Union, we not only cannot take good account of the rationalization of工艺方法, but it is also difficult to plan the series of products in a planned way.
    In the future, we must gradually learn to produce various large-scale, precision, and complete sets of machinery and equipment. This is a huge task. We must learn to design these devices ourselves. The training of design forces takes a long time and is not an easy task. Therefore, now we should actively carry out our own design, accumulate work experience, and rapidly increase design forces, so as to gradually meet the technical equipment needed by various sectors of the national economy, especially large-scale, precision, and complete sets of equipment.
    What are the current difficulties in designing ourselves? In addition to objective difficulties, the main obstacles in subjective terms are that some enterprise leaders and designers still have "fear of difficulty" thinking. They believe that their own design level is low, lack experience, and lack sufficient confidence. Product designers worry about being criticized or punished for designing incorrectly, and even refuse to modify the drawings they know are problematic. Some competent departments are afraid of having too many varieties and taking risks, and are afraid that their own design will involve a part of the technical force and affect the current production tasks. They criticize design personnel for errors in design, provide little specific help, and even investigate technical errors as political issues, which increases the concerns of design personnel and makes them afraid to work boldly.
    Is it possible for us to design ourselves? The answer is yes. In the past year or so, we have successfully designed many important new products that are technically complex. For example, a 10,000 kilowatt automated hydro-generator set, a 2,600-ton coastal passenger and cargo ship, a Type 151 freight locomotive, and a 12,000 kilowatt turbine generator set. The design of a 72,000 kilowatt giant hydroelectric power equipment and some special machine tools has also begun. When the Type 151 freight locomotive was being prepared for design, some leaders estimated that it would take three years to design successfully, but in fact it only took one year and three months to complete the entire design. This shows that as long as we overcome conservative thinking and take specific measures, it is entirely possible to design ourselves. As long as we humbly and cautiously practice continuously, learning while doing, we can continuously improve the design level. Due to lack of experience, it is inevitable to make some mistakes in our work. As long as we carefully study and find out the causes of the errors and the correct solutions, we will not make similar mistakes again in the future. Of course, working boldly does not mean working blindly. Design work involves very complex technical and scientific issues, and we should never be careless. Leading organs should broaden their horizons, focus on the long-term interests of the country and the development of enterprises, actively support their own design work, create favorable working conditions for product designers, give them the economic support and political trust they deserve, and encourage their achievements, no matter how small.
    Product design is a creative labor, but any design contains a lot of experience from manufacturers and designers. Therefore, designers must not only be good at independent thinking, but also pay great attention to creatively learning from the experience of others. To learn from the experience of others, we must widely collect product design data. We must collect and study the data of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, and also collect and study the data of capitalist countries; we must both learn and collect and study foreign data, and also pay close attention to collecting and studying domestic data. Only by widely collecting and studying data can we absorb the best experience and design the best products. In the past, due to overly strict confidentiality system and complicated internship surveying procedures, certain difficulties were created for technical information exchange work. In the future, the confidentiality restrictions should be appropriately relaxed, and the complicated surveying procedures should also be appropriately simplified.
    In order to avoid errors caused by subjectivism, in our own design, we should pay attention to linking with reality, linking with the masses, and soliciting opinions widely, especially paying attention to the opinions of users.
    In the future, in order to actively carry out our own design work, we must not only attach importance to发挥 the role of existing design personnel, but also must actively train new design forces. The method of cultivating new forces is to equip a group of new forces with design backbones with a certain theoretical level and practical work experience, under the guidance of experts, and implement professional division of labor. We must be bold in 放手 for the training of new forces. In this way, the designers can be stimulated to better发挥 their strengths. Design personnel should also further发挥 their enthusiasm and initiative. As long as we are not afraid of difficulties and work tenaciously, we will surely be able to gradually design more and more large-scale, precision, complete sets of, and excellent machinery and equipment for the country.

### 自己设计新机器

    自己设计新机器
    我国社会主义工业化的主要要求，就是大约要在三个五年计划时期内，基本上建成一个完整的工业体系。机械工业是建成这个完整工业体系的主要环节之一。它必须为国民经济各部门的发展提供出足够数量的新产品新设备。
    在过去几年的时间里，我国的机械工业曾经为国民经济各部门的需要，制造了几千种新产品。由于我们自己的设计力量薄弱，这些产品绝大部分都是仿照苏联和兄弟国家供给的产品图样和自行测绘的产品图样来生产的。在1957年，我们计划发展的四百多种新产品中，仍有三百多种新产品需要依靠仿造来完成。这说明，无论过去和现在，仿造都是解决我国设计力量薄弱的一个重要方法。今后，在一定时期内，它仍然是解决我国设计力量不足的一个重要方法。
    但是，随着国民经济的发展，单纯依靠仿造已经不能满足需要。有些产品，可以照现成的图样仿造或测绘；还有许多产品，必须根据自己国家的资源、自然特点以及使用上的具体条件和要求来自己设计。比如，我国荒地少，除了旱地以外，还有水田，因此在设计农业机械的时候，就要考虑我国的地形、土壤、气候和耕作等特点，不能单纯仿造。各种动力设备和特殊专用设备，也必须根据具体使用条件和动力资源的特点来设计。
    就机械工业本身来说，如果不考虑自己工厂的生产特点，而机械地搬用国外设计，也会造成生产上的不合理现象，从而影响生产能力的发挥。例如，我们的机床厂生产的仿苏式万能机床，机床本身很优良。但是，由于我们在同一工厂内生产着在苏联几个工厂生产的产品，因而不仅不能很好考虑工艺方法的合理化，也很难有计划地安排产品的系列。
    今后我们要逐步学会生产各种大型的、精密的、全套的机器设备。这是一个巨大任务。我们一定要学会自己设计这些设备。而设计力量的培养需要较长的时间，并不是件很容易的事。因此现在我们就应当积极进行自己设计，积累工作经验，使设计力量迅速增长，以便逐步满足国民经济各部门需要的技术装备特别是大型的、精密的、成套的装备。
    目前自己设计有些什么困难呢？除了客观上的困难以外，在主观上存在着的主要障碍是一些企业领导人员和设计人员还有“畏难”思想。他们认为自己设计的水平低，缺乏经验，没有足够的信心。产品设计师们担心设计错了受到批评或处分，甚至明知仿造的图样有问题也不肯修改。某些主管部门怕品种多、冒风险，怕自己设计会牵扯一部分技术力量，影响当前生产任务。他们对设计人员设计中发生的错误，责难多，具体帮助少，甚至把技术上的错误当作政治问题来追查，更增加了设计人员的顾虑，使他们不敢大胆地工作。
    我们自己设计有没有可能呢？回答是肯定的。近一年多以来，我们已设计成功了不少在技术上比较复杂的重要新产品。例如，一万瓩自动化水轮发电机组，二千六百吨的沿海客货轮，一五一型货运机车，一万二千瓩的汽轮机组。七万二千瓩的巨型水力发电设备和一些专用机床也已开始设计了。一五一货运机车在准备设计的时候，某些领导人员估计需要三年才能设计成功，可是事实上只用了一年零三个月的时间就全部设计成功了。这说明，只要我们克服保守思想，采取具体措施，自己设计是完全有可能的。只要我们虚心谨慎地不断实践，边做边学，就能不断提高设计水平。由于缺乏经验，工作中犯某些错误是难免的，只要我们认真研究，找出产生错误的原因和正确解决的办法，以后就不会再犯同类的错误。当然，大胆工作并不等于蛮干。设计工作中包含非常复杂的技术科学问题，绝对不应当粗心草率。领导机关要放宽眼界，要从国家的长远利益和企业的发展着眼，积极支持自己设计工作，给产品设计人员创造有利的工作条件，给予应有的经济上的支持和政治上的信任，鼓励他们的点滴成就。
    产品设计是一项创造性的劳动，但是任何一种设计又都包含着很多制造者的经验和设计者的经验。因此，设计人员不仅要善于独立思考，而且要非常重视创造性地学习别人的经验。要学习别人经验就必须广泛收集产品设计资料。既要收集和研究苏联及其他兄弟国家的资料，也要收集和研究资本主义国家的资料；既要学习和收集研究国外资料，也要十分注意收集和研究国内的资料。只有广泛收集和研究资料，才能吸收最好的经验，设计最好的产品。过去，由于保密制度过严，实习测绘手续复杂，曾经给技术情报交流工作造成一定困难。今后，应该将保密限制适当放宽，复杂的测绘手续也应适当简化。
    为了避免主观主义造成的错误，在自己设计中，要注意联系实际，联系群众，广泛征求意见，特别是要重视使用者的意见。
    今后为了积极开展自己设计的工作，不仅要重视发挥已有设计人员的作用，并且必须积极培养新生的设计力量。培养新生力量的方法，可以在专家指导下，配备上具有一定理论水平和实际工作经验的设计骨干，带动一批新生力量，实行专业分工。对新生力量培养要大胆放手。这样，可以激发设计人员更好地发挥力量。设计人员也要进一步发挥积极性、主动性。只要我们不怕困难，顽强地劳动，我们就一定能够逐步地给国家设计出愈来愈多的大型的、精密的、成套的、优良的机器设备。
